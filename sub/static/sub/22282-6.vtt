a storm coming in.

be pretty serious.
-(WHIRRS)

00:15.467 --> 00:17.900
You can see and you can feel,

00:17.967 --> 00:20.133
um, there is
a little bit of south wind.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.800
If you look above,

00:22.133 --> 00:24.667
you've got blue sky above,

00:25.100 --> 00:26.400
all around me

00:26.467 --> 00:30.200
the wind is kicking up
all this frozen particulates,

00:30.300 --> 00:32.467
which is showing me, you know,

00:32.533 --> 00:35.733
the halo effect on the, uh,
on the sun.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.867
The ptarmigan
are coming out to eat.

00:39.967 --> 00:42.333
Shows me that I might not be
too off in my assessment

00:42.400 --> 00:45.100
of where the weather is.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.500
This time of year, you just,

00:47.567 --> 00:49.767
bad weather comes at ya
at 100 miles an hour.

00:50.067 --> 00:53.033
If I'm gonna have hurricane
force winds hitting me,

00:53.100 --> 00:55.367
it's nice to know
and get ready
for that ahead of time

00:55.433 --> 00:56.767
and not wait
till it gets here.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.300
If you're one of those people
that procrastinates
till it gets here,

01:00.800 --> 01:02.500
you're not gonna be here long.

NARRATOR: In order
to survive the harsh storm
approaching Kavik,

01:32.067 --> 01:33.867
Sue Aikens
must secure her camp

01:33.933 --> 01:36.667
to prevent damage
from high tundra winds.

01:37.367 --> 01:40.967
SUE: All this blowing snow
is like a talcum powder
of snow and

01:41.033 --> 01:44.267
it will get into everything
and stick to everything.

01:44.833 --> 01:48.500
I'm looking
at any trailer, visualising.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.367
I am looking to see

01:51.400 --> 01:54.267
are all the windows up,
are all the doors flush.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.867
Here's a screen

01:56.100 --> 02:00.067
on the top edge I need to
verify that the window is up.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.800
The glass is up.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.167
(CLATTERS)

02:08.600 --> 02:10.533
Normally this is
all sealed up.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.667
That should always be twisted,
locked and secured.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.833
Anything out on the tundra
can become a missile

02:16.900 --> 02:18.400
in these windstorms.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.267
Fifty-five mile an hour
doesn't sound horrific,

02:20.800 --> 02:23.767
but you add it to
20 below zero

02:24.000 --> 02:26.133
brittle things break
and fly off.

02:26.433 --> 02:30.100
Right now,
I am with a specific eye
towards what can fly

02:30.167 --> 02:32.900
and damage camp if the winds
actually do pick up.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.133
One minute thing
happening way out here,

02:36.200 --> 02:38.300
almost a quarter mile away
from where I live,

02:38.367 --> 02:39.667
is going to chain react

02:39.733 --> 02:42.000
and send me to Deadhorse in
about three seconds flat.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.033
My entire life
is invested in this camp.

02:48.333 --> 02:51.133
My heart is
invested in its success.

02:53.067 --> 02:56.500
Every time I think
there's gonna be
a gnarly weather system,

02:56.633 --> 02:58.767
every time I think
I've got a predator

02:58.833 --> 03:01.900
tearing crap up out here,
I will be out here

03:01.967 --> 03:04.933
making sure the integrity
of my camp is maintained.

03:10.433 --> 03:13.067
Did the boundary
and the perimeter on camp.

03:13.133 --> 03:14.400
It's secure.

03:14.633 --> 03:18.100
I have other chores
away from camp
that I need to complete,

03:18.233 --> 03:20.033
so with camp being secure,

03:20.100 --> 03:21.933
now I can get my mind
to other chores.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.900
When there's
a big storm coming in,

03:24.967 --> 03:27.567
you don't plan your chores
for when it starts to blow.

03:27.633 --> 03:30.500
When it starts to blow, you
better have your chores done.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.533
CHIP: We're always preparing
for the next season
or the next hunt

03:37.600 --> 03:39.367
or the next fishing trip.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.300
Preparing to us
is like half of the battle.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.000
We've got a lot of snow now.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.467
We had a pretty good storm,
dumped a lot of snow.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.600
It's just gotten cold, our
river is just freezing solid.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.300
So we're right at the edge of
being able to use these things

03:59.367 --> 04:00.567
anywhere and anytime,

04:00.667 --> 04:02.700
so right now is the time
to make sure they're good.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.900
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
depend on snow machines

04:05.967 --> 04:09.467

-to hunt...

04:10.733 --> 04:13.800
...fish and gather resources
in dark winter.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.167
But travelling on
icy conditions is dangerous

04:17.933 --> 04:19.733
and to ensure
his family's safety,

04:20.100 --> 04:22.033
Chip must constantly
give his machines

04:22.100 --> 04:26.233
proper maintenance
and care.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.267
CHIP: These aren't
recreational vehicles to us.

04:28.333 --> 04:29.767
These are our cars.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.433
These are not toys to us.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.333
If you don't
take care of your stuff,
it won't take care of you.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.000
I don't want my wife or my
kids to go off in the country

04:36.067 --> 04:37.133
and have to walk back.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.067
I'm definitely gonna get it

04:39.133 --> 04:41.300
maintained and serviced
and ready to go.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.967
So the thing is that
with preventative maintenance,

04:43.033 --> 04:44.567
we don't have
troubles out there

04:44.633 --> 04:46.767
because we're trying
to cure those troubles here.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.400
Go have a look
at the undercarriage.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.533
I look for dead shocks,
the feel of dead shocks.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.300
I want to feel some pressure
and some compression.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.733
These are feeling good.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.200
One of our wear parts
on a snow machine is a belt.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.333
You can burn 'em up,
bust 'em, blow 'em,

05:08.400 --> 05:10.467
all kinds of things
happen to belts.

05:10.533 --> 05:13.100
So we always travel
with a spare.

05:13.167 --> 05:14.367
These are our guide rods.

05:14.433 --> 05:16.600
These are down in the snow
and when we wanna turn,

05:16.667 --> 05:18.400
these are the rods
that make a turn.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.100
These are
essential to steering,

05:20.167 --> 05:21.700
so I always check
the guide rods.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.133
I wanna go take it out
and give it a real ride.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.933
I want to open it up.
We call it a shakedown,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.700
you go out
and go find out what's wrong.

(SNOWMOBILE ENGINE ROARS)

05:49.200 --> 05:50.633
Right now I just wanna check
and make sure

05:50.700 --> 05:51.967
the engine is running fine

05:52.033 --> 05:54.200
and we do that
by opening them up fully

05:54.267 --> 05:55.667
for as long as we can.

05:55.733 --> 05:57.067
You know, anywhere from, uh,

05:57.133 --> 06:00.233
like a 10 to 20-mile ride
is a good shakedown here.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.567
We're always getting ready.

06:01.633 --> 06:03.100
Our winter's just started.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.333
Our river's just froze up.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.167
We've hit some really
cold temperatures.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.400
It's time to use the machines.
So, we've got 'em prepared.

06:09.467 --> 06:11.100
Every time we get a chance,
you know,

06:11.167 --> 06:12.500
you just go out
and get it ready again.

06:12.567 --> 06:13.933
Add gas, check your belts.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.100
It's just
a very routine thing.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.867
I like the engine,
I like the drive train.

06:22.933 --> 06:25.500

my drive train sounds good,

06:25.567 --> 06:28.200
my engine is sounding good.

It's gonna be
in the morning at 8:00

get out there and

07:40.167 --> 07:42.533
use this as

07:42.800 --> 07:45.800
I'm gonna be
taking it very easy,
this is a young dog team.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.100
I'm just trying
to set their heads up

07:47.167 --> 07:49.000
and their mentality
to enjoy this.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.900
So I'm not going there
to push or race, per se.

07:51.967 --> 07:55.233
My main thing is
to come home with healthy dogs

07:55.300 --> 07:56.967
that had a good experience.

07:57.133 --> 07:58.500
(SAW WHIRRING)

07:58.567 --> 08:01.300
I got to get this beef cut up
into manageable pieces

08:01.367 --> 08:03.000
to where I can
thaw it out really easily

08:03.067 --> 08:04.533
on the trail for the dogs.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.300
I can't take
a big giant block of beef

08:07.367 --> 08:10.033
out on the trail
and expect to be efficient,

08:10.100 --> 08:13.333
so I've gotta cut this up
into small pieces.

08:13.633 --> 08:17.133
For what I'm doing,
I need about 60 pounds of meat

08:17.400 --> 08:19.567
to feed to my dogs
on the trail.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.133
Dogs need warm meals,
so you have to make it

08:25.200 --> 08:27.000
to where it
doesn't take you hours

08:27.067 --> 08:29.400
and days
to prepare this out there.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.967
So I'll package it up in bags.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.967
What this will do
is it will all freeze thin

08:35.033 --> 08:36.967
and that way I'll take a bag

08:37.033 --> 08:38.633
and I'll put it in
some hot water,

08:38.700 --> 08:42.633
thaw it out in the cooler,
so right when I get
to the checkpoint,

08:42.700 --> 08:45.067
where my dogs
are gonna camp and rest,

08:45.133 --> 08:47.267
I've got that meal ready
and prepared

08:47.800 --> 08:49.967
and they need this
red protein meat to

08:50.867 --> 08:53.300
build muscle and they
burn a lot of calories.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.733
You can't have these dogs
waiting to get their food

08:57.067 --> 08:59.733
because then they
won't recover correctly.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.900
I've got a lot more to do
before this all

09:07.967 --> 09:10.600
can come together
and I've got about 30 hours,

09:10.667 --> 09:13.433
then I got to be down
in Cantwell at the race start.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.167
It's pretty much nonstop
from this point on out.

09:18.333 --> 09:22.033
This is where you get your
sleep deprivation training
for the longer races.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.267
I don't even think
about the finish line,

09:24.367 --> 09:27.433
I'm just trying to make it to
the starting line right now.

09:31.167 --> 09:33.033
GLENN: Some people
don't need variety,

09:33.100 --> 09:35.233
but a lot of people,
they're missing something
and maybe they don't realise

09:35.300 --> 09:37.167
there's a lot of variety
out here the way I'm living.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.800
My camp's on a small lake

09:44.467 --> 09:46.633
in a valley
between the mountains

09:47.500 --> 09:49.733
and all winter long,
when I'm hunting and trapping,

09:49.800 --> 09:51.233
I just get around on foot.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.233
If I need to return home,

09:53.867 --> 09:56.067
I can only go
so far during a day

09:56.367 --> 09:58.433
and then I have to turn around
and come back to camp.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.400
Yeah, you gotta cover
a lot of country.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.667
In order to intercept
the animals out here,

10:01.733 --> 10:02.967
you have to cover
a lot of country.

10:03.033 --> 10:05.100
There's times when I sit here,
looking at this lake

10:05.167 --> 10:08.600
for a month, not a single
large animal crosses it.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.400
That's not uncommon
in the wintertime.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.633
So I gotta
broaden my horizons.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.233
I gotta get out
and travel more country

10:13.333 --> 10:14.967
in order
to intercept animals.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.400
If I build another camp
down here,

10:17.600 --> 10:19.467
that will extend my range.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.667
So I'll build a woodstove,
and I'll build a lamp

10:21.733 --> 10:23.033
and then I'll take
that canvas tent

10:23.100 --> 10:25.200
and I'll set up a camp
further away from home.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.267
This is a little
sweat lodge I built

10:30.333 --> 10:31.900
about a year and a half ago.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.033
It's nice place
to take a sauna,

10:35.100 --> 10:36.600
but this time of year

10:36.667 --> 10:37.733
I'm burning up so much wood

10:37.800 --> 10:39.000
when I heat
this little tent up

10:39.067 --> 10:41.033
that I've decided not to
use it any more this winter.

10:44.167 --> 10:45.800
I'm gonna reappropriate
the woodstove in it

10:45.867 --> 10:47.600
for my camp down the valley.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.400
I'm gonna use some of
this moose fat to light

10:58.667 --> 10:59.800
my tent with.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.433
What I have to do
is get the fat all cleaned up

11:03.500 --> 11:04.867
and then melt it down.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.267
Now I'm gonna use
some of this moose for food,

11:08.333 --> 11:10.800
I'm gonna use some of it
to light my tent with

11:10.867 --> 11:12.733
and what I don't use

11:12.800 --> 11:14.567
something else
will come along and use.

11:16.733 --> 11:21.033
This moose was living its life
eating the willows around here

11:21.100 --> 11:24.967
and those willows
got turned into this fat,
this big cycle.

11:25.133 --> 11:26.967
This is what is happening
in the modern world.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.700
People are
getting disconnected
from the cycles of nature.

11:29.967 --> 11:32.367
You just turn on a switch
and you've got light

11:32.433 --> 11:34.233
and you don't think about
where it came from.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.800
But when I build this lamp,

11:35.867 --> 11:37.633
I'm gonna think more
about where it came from

11:37.733 --> 11:39.533
'cause I killed this moose.

11:43.067 --> 11:45.800
I just heated it up
on the stove until it melted.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.633
This is now liquid,
but I have to cool it off

11:47.700 --> 11:50.600
and turn it back to a solid
so I can transport it.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.967
I'm gonna pack
everything on my sled.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.467
It'll all be wrapped up
in this tarp.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.533
There.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.167
Got everything I need to build
my home away from home
right there.

12:03.667 --> 12:04.667
I'm gonna head out.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.367
(WHISPERS) Hey,
there's caribou right here.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.500
I'm just gonna leave
my sled here.

12:32.167 --> 12:34.000
Try to sneak up close enough
to these caribou

12:34.067 --> 12:35.367
to get a shot.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.667
I'm going to try
to work my way through
the trees really quietly

12:41.733 --> 12:43.833
to get close enough
to get a shot.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.700
They heard me coming down
through the woods

12:56.767 --> 12:58.167
before I got close enough
to get a shot.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.367
They took off and ran away.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.500
Just up ahead

13:03.567 --> 13:05.033
there's another lake.

13:40.267 --> 13:41.700
Caribou kept going.

13:41.933 --> 13:44.500
I don't think I'm gonna get a
second chance at 'em tonight,

13:44.567 --> 13:46.067
but I gotta go
back to my sled,

13:46.133 --> 13:47.200
get my stuff,
bring it down here.

13:47.267 --> 13:48.967
I'm gonna set up camp
in this area.

13:49.033 --> 13:50.700
I'm real close to the lake,

13:50.933 --> 13:52.600
where caribou often
hang out down here

13:52.667 --> 13:54.733
and there's a chance
they will come back.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.767
It's been a couple of months
since I've seen caribou.

13:56.833 --> 13:58.367
It's good
that they're in the area.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.033
Some years they aren't,
you never know.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.600
There are times
when months pass
with no caribou at all,

14:02.667 --> 14:05.367
but right now there's some
caribou around, that's good.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.733
Good chance
I'll find more caribou.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.533
AGNES: I know
in the back of my head,

14:12.600 --> 14:15.067
hey, these girls
are gonna be comfortable
when they grow up out here,

14:15.133 --> 14:16.800
so I don't have
to worry about them.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.467
-The shoulder's
gonna be right there.
-TINMIAQ: Up, up, up.

14:19.533 --> 14:20.567
Up, up, up.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.967
Put like marks,
like right there.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.033
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,
passing down Native traditions

14:28.100 --> 14:30.400
ensures their way of life
will be preserved.

14:31.733 --> 14:35.000
Today, Agnes will guide
her eldest daughter Tinmiaq

14:35.067 --> 14:37.700
in sewing winter clothing
from harvested animals.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.933
AGNES: We're making me
a parka today.

14:42.067 --> 14:44.333
This is gonna be
a pretty light parka.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.900
When it's all sewn together,
we have three wolf skins.

14:47.167 --> 14:50.367
Our traditional style
for women is
usually wolverine,

14:50.433 --> 14:52.567
so I'm gonna be using
the wolverine

14:52.633 --> 14:54.633
skin as my ruff and my trims.

14:54.767 --> 14:57.467
Most women
don't use wolf skins,

14:57.567 --> 15:00.267
but if it's warm and it works
and the hair don't pull

15:00.333 --> 15:02.633
when you're out
in the extreme cold, why not?

15:03.300 --> 15:04.900
Lay there like this.

15:05.033 --> 15:08.033
This will be
the top of my shoulders
up here and then,

15:08.100 --> 15:11.533
it'll just go rounded up, eh?

15:12.067 --> 15:14.533
While I work in here
and try to make me a parka,

15:14.600 --> 15:17.333
Chip's outdoors, uh,
working on our snow machines

15:17.400 --> 15:20.200
so when we get to actually get
out to the country and travel,

15:20.267 --> 15:23.367
we'll be warm
and we'll have a good ride.

15:24.267 --> 15:25.267
TINMIAQ: Back.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.333
So this would fit over you.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.633
These should be your armpits
right there. Perfect.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.700
Good?

15:31.833 --> 15:33.300
-Good?
-Yeah.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.367
Okay, now that
we have this all

15:35.433 --> 15:36.900
cut out the way we want it

15:36.967 --> 15:40.433
we could just
start getting our sinew
and our sewing bag...

15:40.500 --> 15:42.200
-Start sewing?
-Start sewing.

15:45.033 --> 15:47.533
AGNES: I've been teaching her
all the little tricks and

15:47.600 --> 15:48.967
different kinds of stitches

15:49.033 --> 15:51.267
that I know that my mum
passed on to me.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.200
I am hoping
when she has her own children,

15:54.267 --> 15:56.033
she'll pass those on
to her children.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.100
Right now, the parka's
inside out and, uh,

16:00.167 --> 16:02.467
this is the way we work on it,
but once we get done

16:02.533 --> 16:04.200
we're gonna turn it
the other way

16:04.267 --> 16:06.900
and it should
turn out pretty good.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.433
Custom fit.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.567
JESSIE: If you love
what you do, you never
work a day in your life.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.800
Gotta have my sleeping bag.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.400
Never know what
could happen out there,

16:26.467 --> 16:28.900
so you got to be prepared
to take care of your own self.

16:29.767 --> 16:32.600
This is a very important part
of my equipment right here.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.767
NARRATOR: With his first
test run of the racing season

16:35.833 --> 16:40.933
only hours away, Jessie must
quickly gather his equipment
and 14 sled dogs.

16:41.567 --> 16:42.867
JESSIE: It's time
to race, man.

16:42.933 --> 16:44.300
This is what, you know,
all this training

16:44.367 --> 16:47.167
and all this work
and acquiring and breeding

16:47.233 --> 16:50.100
and getting all these dogs
is all about, is racing, so.

16:50.267 --> 16:51.867
A little bit nervous
until I actually get to

16:51.933 --> 16:53.267
the starting line of the race,
so it's, uh,

16:53.533 --> 16:55.700
still got travel, time,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.133
never be surprised
if the truck broke down.

17:04.967 --> 17:07.667
All right. Well,
these dog boxes are done,

17:07.733 --> 17:10.800
now all they need
is a bunch of dogs
in 'em to christen it.

17:11.467 --> 17:13.500
-Come here, buddy.
-(BARKS)

17:13.667 --> 17:16.500
What I lack in
not being established
in this sport,

17:16.567 --> 17:20.700
I plan on making up for by my
physical and mental toughness.

17:20.933 --> 17:22.067
Hold up there, buddy.

17:22.133 --> 17:23.867
I'm not gonna be the weak link

17:24.133 --> 17:25.933
and it sets
a good example for the dogs

17:26.000 --> 17:27.933
of what we got
to be like out there.

17:28.033 --> 17:29.367
They're looking for leadership

17:29.433 --> 17:32.367
and if I can lead them
with that mindset,

17:32.433 --> 17:35.633
to be physically
and mentally tougher
than other dogs

17:35.700 --> 17:37.200
and other mushers,
that's my goal.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.567
It's yet to see
what this team can do,

17:39.633 --> 17:42.033
but I can do
all the right things
to set them up.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.667
I secure everything now and
give everything a final check,

17:50.733 --> 17:51.733
hit the road.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.700
Still got a good
few hour drive ahead of me.

17:57.833 --> 18:01.067
Gonna take it nice and slow
and make sure we get there.

18:01.133 --> 18:03.200
That's why you start early,
that's why you sleep less,

18:03.267 --> 18:06.000
because you can
take your time and be safe.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.767
(ENGINE STARTING)

18:11.833 --> 18:12.833
(ENGINE ROARS)

18:17.000 --> 18:18.333
(ENGINE STOPS)

18:19.533 --> 18:20.800
Damn it!

18:21.667 --> 18:23.233
(ENGINE STARTS)

18:25.467 --> 18:28.100
Well, the truck's running.
That's a good sign.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.333
I've had
way more problems with trucks

18:30.400 --> 18:31.867
than I've ever had with dogs.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.900
Trucks, you know,
they take a lot of TLC

18:34.967 --> 18:37.367
and love and care,
just like the dogs.

18:44.233 --> 18:46.700
I got all my dogs loaded up
and we're heading south.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.433
Got a three-hour drive
ahead of me

18:48.500 --> 18:50.200
to get to the Denali Highway.

18:50.333 --> 18:53.733
I got precious cargo on board
is the main thing, you know?

18:54.533 --> 18:58.333
This is precious cargo to me.
That's my whole life back
there in those boxes.

19:00.533 --> 19:01.833
This is a good, short race.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.133
It's a good opportunity to
get them young dogs out there

19:04.200 --> 19:05.267
and get 'em some experience,

19:05.333 --> 19:08.333
so I pretty much
have a split team of

19:08.400 --> 19:12.000
my good veteran dogs
to set a good example,

19:12.200 --> 19:14.700
and then I got a lot of
young prospects in there.

19:14.867 --> 19:18.167
They gotta get the experience
and I feel pretty nervous.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.433
When you got nerves like this
before a race,

19:20.567 --> 19:23.567
it means that
it means something to you,
racing, you know?

19:23.633 --> 19:24.700
So...

19:24.767 --> 19:26.467
I'm glad
I'm a little bit nervous.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.633
All right, we're here.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.400
Now the work begins.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.933
So, once I get my dogs all out

19:48.000 --> 19:50.300
and they all get a chance
to use the bathroom,

19:50.367 --> 19:52.633
I can get my sled pulled out
and stretched out

19:52.700 --> 19:54.967
and start planning my exit.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.833
-(BARKING)
-All right, straight ahead,

20:01.900 --> 20:04.233
straight ahead. Easy.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.733
-Jessie Holmes! Jessie Holmes!
-Got it.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.600
Thanks, guys. Thank you.

20:11.633 --> 20:14.367
Being physically
and mentally weak
is not an option.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.267
I have to keep
my head in the game always.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.700
I have dogs that depend on me.

20:18.833 --> 20:21.600
They depend on me
to be a rock in the storm.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.367
I don't care
about first place.

20:23.433 --> 20:27.733
I care about my dog team,
and I care about
their long-term future.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.233
Easy, boys.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.500
SUE: Some people
beat the traffic
to get to their jobs.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.867
I'm beating Mother Nature
to get to my job.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.833
I'd like to say I got
one foot ahead of the storm,

20:40.900 --> 20:43.267
but I think
I'm right in the thick of it.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.533
NARRATOR: As Kavik's
sole resident,

20:46.600 --> 20:48.600
Sue performs various tasks

20:48.900 --> 20:50.667
to ensure safe passage
on the tundra

20:50.733 --> 20:52.833
and prevent damage
to the ecosystem,

20:53.267 --> 20:55.533
but with
a fierce storm on the horizon

20:55.800 --> 20:59.500
heading into high winds
and freezing conditions
to collect the data

20:59.567 --> 21:01.000
is a dangerous mission.

21:01.367 --> 21:04.033
Work that
I'm getting ready to do,
the snow depth,

21:04.367 --> 21:06.433
I've got to take my equipment

21:06.500 --> 21:08.367
several different

21:08.500 --> 21:10.333
spots further north.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.233
I have to stop and take
20 measurements at each site.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.867
For the state to be able
to open the ice road permits,

21:16.933 --> 21:20.267
they need to know
that the ground is a minimum
of five below zero

21:20.333 --> 21:22.267
and that you have certain snow
and ice depths.

21:22.867 --> 21:26.333
So one of my jobs is to go
and take some measurements.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.300
My temperatures
are dropping real quick.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.200
Weather here
during the winter,

21:32.367 --> 21:35.300
the severity of it
is the difference
between life and death.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.500
The wind has now shifted
coming in out of the east,

21:38.567 --> 21:40.767
which is where all
the big wind is coming in at.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.367
If it hits me,
doesn't mean I can't go.

21:43.433 --> 21:46.233
Just means I'll be grateful
for having a cab on a truck.

21:46.933 --> 21:49.700
(ENGINE REVVING)

21:58.867 --> 22:00.867
We're only going
a couple of miles out,

22:00.933 --> 22:03.333
but you can get lost
in between here

22:03.400 --> 22:06.300
and the next building
if a storm kicks up.

22:06.767 --> 22:09.467
Uh, here I just have
some light tools, rope,

22:09.533 --> 22:12.033
tarp if I need to tarp it
and do something.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.767
I've got extra mittens,
extra warm weather gear,

22:15.500 --> 22:17.400
to try and help me stay safe.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.900
The dangers
of going away from camp
in this kind of weather,

22:34.500 --> 22:36.967
I mean, you may not find
your way back.

22:37.867 --> 22:40.667
I can see some,
I can't see everything.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.767
That's a danger.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.833
The wind kicks up any worse,

22:44.900 --> 22:47.133
I may or may not
make it back home.

22:52.967 --> 22:55.467
AGNES: We're able to
live together, work together

22:55.533 --> 22:57.767
and it just makes us
even stronger.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.600
(MOTOR ZOOMS)

23:04.133 --> 23:05.433
NARRATOR:
After performing maintenance

23:05.500 --> 23:07.867
and testing his snow machine
on flat terrain,

23:08.500 --> 23:12.300
Chip must now take the vehicle
out to the more gruelling
tundra landscape.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.167
Right now I'm getting the
machines ready for

23:14.267 --> 23:16.267
using here during the winter.

23:17.567 --> 23:18.800
'Cause it's
only gonna get colder

23:18.867 --> 23:20.100
and the night's
gonna get longer

23:20.167 --> 23:22.433
and pretty soon
it's gonna be really cold.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.100
It only makes sense
to ride something
you can depend on.

23:25.167 --> 23:27.433
If I knew something was wrong
and I took it 20 miles out,

23:27.500 --> 23:29.733
I'd probably be
walking 20 miles back.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.967
The whole trick is to, uh,
is to get ready beforehand,

23:33.100 --> 23:34.700
and, uh, I'm getting ready.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.000
Fucking damn it!

24:03.933 --> 24:05.633
My undercarriage is fucked up.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.233
My undercarriage is frozen.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.767
I don't mean frozen
as in cold,

24:10.833 --> 24:11.967
I mean as in stuck

24:12.133 --> 24:14.233
and the rods got rusted
and the thing is stuck.

24:14.933 --> 24:16.100
(GROANS)

24:18.367 --> 24:20.433
I'll try to see if
I can get this one to go good.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.000
I just need to take it home.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.567
Take it home, thaw it out,
take the undercarriage out.

24:24.633 --> 24:27.133
Uh, probably change
the shocks out.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.567
That's probably my best bet.

24:29.633 --> 24:31.900
But at 35 below zero,
this is no time to be trying

24:31.967 --> 24:33.500
to take
this thing apart outside.

24:33.567 --> 24:35.267
So, I'll have to wait till
the weather warms up,

24:35.600 --> 24:37.967
then I should be able
to unbolt and undo things

24:38.033 --> 24:40.767
without ripping the gaskets,
without ruining the bearings,

24:40.833 --> 24:43.633
without snapping the bolts off
or breaking any plastic,

24:43.833 --> 24:45.833
so, my life's
dictated by weather.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.100
We're not prepared.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.400
This isn't prepared, and I'm
not gonna be going anywhere.

24:50.467 --> 24:52.833
Sometimes you just can't do
anything for it.

24:55.867 --> 24:58.933
JESSIE: When one lets go
of trying to control
the outcome all the time,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.900
I think better things
happen for you.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.167
Haw! Good, straight ahead.

25:03.233 --> 25:04.233
Haw.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.500
Good dogs. Good dogs.

25:05.567 --> 25:07.967
Haw, haw.

25:09.033 --> 25:10.600
Hey.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.800
Haw.

25:12.133 --> 25:14.800
Haw, haw, haw. Haw.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.533
Ho. Ho.

25:18.367 --> 25:19.467
Stay.

25:19.533 --> 25:21.133
NARRATOR: Jessie Holmes
and his sled dogs

25:21.200 --> 25:23.667
are competing in
the first race of the season.

25:23.933 --> 25:27.700
To avoid injury and fatigue,
they must camp out
at the halfway point

25:27.767 --> 25:29.833
of the 51-mile race.

25:30.533 --> 25:33.167
Time to shut these dogs down
for a few hours.

25:33.233 --> 25:36.333
Get some rest in 'em while
they're still looking great
and on a good note.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.567
I just need to get these
booties off the dogs and

25:39.633 --> 25:41.167
get a little
meal into 'em.

25:41.233 --> 25:42.700
We just did 31 miles.

25:42.767 --> 25:45.133
Gonna lay down some straw
and let 'em rest.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.967
Charge their batteries.

25:47.900 --> 25:51.400
I'm gonna mix this in here
and let it sit for a sec

25:51.467 --> 25:53.100
and then what I'm gonna go do
is go take all these

25:53.167 --> 25:54.733
booties off these dogs.

25:55.333 --> 25:57.600
Hey, buddies.
Good dogs, you did so good.

25:57.733 --> 25:59.133
That way I can
get to see every dog

25:59.200 --> 26:00.433
and see how they're feeling.

26:00.500 --> 26:04.267
Try to make sure I get
the food in 'em, within, uh,

26:04.333 --> 26:07.700
30 minutes of arriving
at camp for optimal recovery.

26:09.833 --> 26:11.833
Oh, they're happy.
They're ready to eat.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.033
Oh, yes.

26:13.167 --> 26:14.367
Yup, see,
they're like a family

26:14.433 --> 26:16.500
when they get out here
and do this.

26:16.967 --> 26:18.767
It's important
for team bonding,

26:19.067 --> 26:20.667
eating meals together.

26:24.467 --> 26:26.033
Okay, guys,
we're gonna get
a good little rest

26:26.100 --> 26:27.433
and then
we're gonna hit the trail.

26:27.867 --> 26:28.867
Yeah.

26:28.933 --> 26:30.000
Make a big ol' bed
for you guys,

26:30.067 --> 26:31.467
-you can all cuddle.
-(SQUEALS)

26:31.533 --> 26:32.900
Keep each other warm.

26:33.867 --> 26:35.133
Gonna pull out my sleeping bag

26:35.200 --> 26:37.667
and sit on it
and stay nice and toasty.

26:37.967 --> 26:40.233
That way the dogs
get the idea,

26:40.633 --> 26:42.133
but that's it, you know,
that's what you do

26:42.200 --> 26:45.267
all the work
ahead of time for is
to have your routine down

26:45.333 --> 26:47.200
and that's one of the things
you're practising out here

26:47.267 --> 26:50.133
and getting used to, the dogs
have to get used to it.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.267
Still hard, but I'd say it's
getting a lot easier for me.

26:58.967 --> 27:00.300
Keeping at this.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.333
Nothing to do now but, uh,

27:02.400 --> 27:05.767
wait for the dogs
to have a few hours' sleep

27:05.833 --> 27:07.833
and then bootie 'em back up
and hit the trail again.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.600
My journey don't end here.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.200
SUE: There's dangers
no matter where you go.

27:17.267 --> 27:19.600
You don't let those
dangers rule you,

27:19.667 --> 27:21.700
but you better know
where they are.

27:34.367 --> 27:36.700
NARRATOR: Sue is recording
snow depth measurements

27:36.767 --> 27:39.100
to protect
the tundra's ecosystem.

27:39.233 --> 27:41.767
But with her
visibility worsening

27:41.833 --> 27:43.400
she must
collect the data quickly

27:43.467 --> 27:46.167
or risk being stranded
in a brutal storm.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.300
SUE: The conditions
are worsening.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.400
The wind has picked up.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.467
Harder for me to see.

27:54.733 --> 27:58.033
I wanna get to my location,
I wanna start the process.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.733
(ENGINE STOPS)

28:10.967 --> 28:13.067
Wow, that's some
hard-packed snow, man.

28:13.767 --> 28:15.700
I have got

28:15.967 --> 28:18.600
200 feet of rope here.

28:18.733 --> 28:23.133
I have to go so far,
take a reading, go so far,
take another reading.

28:23.367 --> 28:27.800
If I start to lose visibility,
I won't be able to see how to
get back to my own vehicle.

28:28.233 --> 28:30.967
So I'll do
10 measurements this way,

28:31.033 --> 28:34.167
10 measurements that way,
move on to the next location.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.367
Three. Two and a half.

28:55.367 --> 28:58.367
What they're looking for is
two foot of snow overall.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.500
There we go.

29:00.567 --> 29:01.867
And then this is...

29:02.067 --> 29:05.167
You're getting
damn close again,
three and a half feet.

29:05.233 --> 29:06.667
So...

29:06.833 --> 29:09.467
So far my average
is between three and
three and a half feet.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.533
All right.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.600
So that's a wrap on this side.

29:16.967 --> 29:19.633
There's definitely more wind,
colder temps.

29:19.700 --> 29:20.867
I want to be careful.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.200
'Cause as the wind picks up
and the sun goes down,

29:23.267 --> 29:24.600
the temps are gonna drop

29:24.733 --> 29:27.933
and that means it's
more dangerous on my skin.

29:29.367 --> 29:31.233
The temperature's
getting colder,

29:31.467 --> 29:33.267
it's getting
harder and harder to see,

29:33.333 --> 29:36.733
it also is getting
a little bit harder
to take deeper breaths.

29:40.367 --> 29:42.433
But that's 10 measurements
this way, now.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.733
I'll write it all down.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.500
Once I'm done, I'll move
to the next location.

29:46.900 --> 29:48.933
(ENGINE REVVING)

29:51.000 --> 29:52.133
But

29:52.200 --> 29:53.567
it's really degrading.

29:53.767 --> 29:56.133
The uh, visibility
is not good.

29:56.400 --> 29:59.333
-(ENGINE STARTS)
-If the winds
get horrifically bad,

29:59.633 --> 30:02.967
then I'm gonna have
to bail on the second location

30:03.367 --> 30:05.300
in favour of waiting
for the winds to drop.

30:05.367 --> 30:07.833
I can't do it when it's
a danger to life and limb.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.200
The wind is
filling in my tracks

30:15.267 --> 30:17.800
and those, they're
not even 15 minutes old,

30:17.867 --> 30:20.233
so it's time
to call it a night.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.133
Think I've gone about as far
as I feel comfortable going.

30:29.867 --> 30:32.000
I need to be able to
see my tracks to get home.

30:34.467 --> 30:36.300
I can get lost
pretty easy in this.

30:37.633 --> 30:40.100
I just have
no spatial relevance.

30:41.833 --> 30:43.833
I cannot see shit.

30:46.100 --> 30:49.467
Doesn't take a few minutes
and whatever track
you make is gone.

30:50.367 --> 30:53.433
The wind takes care of
the tracks pretty damn quick.

31:02.433 --> 31:04.367
So I'm back on my own runway.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.500
Well, I made it home.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.167
Definitely not as windy here

31:21.233 --> 31:24.633
as it is just a couple of
miles up to the north.

31:24.867 --> 31:28.133
Time for me to maybe
get some electrics going,

31:28.200 --> 31:29.600
and then look at the,

31:29.667 --> 31:31.667
look at the documentation
that I just got.

31:35.467 --> 31:37.000
This right here,

31:37.367 --> 31:39.900
this is, uh...
This is the gold.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.967
You know,
these are all the locations

31:45.033 --> 31:49.000
and the numbers for the state
to approve the tundra travel.

31:49.167 --> 31:52.267
Right now what I'm seeing with
all the measurements I took,

31:52.633 --> 31:54.000
we're well above that.

31:54.500 --> 31:57.267
Next step is,
put it in an email,
send it to the state

31:57.367 --> 31:59.467
and say, this is what I got,
tell me what you think.

32:00.167 --> 32:03.200
This is the culmination of
all of the efforts of the day.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.767
Getting up, securing camp,
watching the weather,

32:07.833 --> 32:10.833
getting my machine rolling,
trying not to be blown over

32:10.900 --> 32:12.733
by the wind as it picked up.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.700
This is what I'm here for.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.100
This is the information I get
to help people out

32:17.167 --> 32:20.067
to make the decisions that
keep this area what it is.

32:20.133 --> 32:21.600
Simple as that.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.533

are about quantity.

32:26.600 --> 32:27.967
I'm about quality.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.033
I don't want numbers,
I want results.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.333
(ENGINE STARTS)

32:45.000 --> 32:47.067
Earlier today I went
and tested out the rides.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.433
This one here is parked.
It's kind of grounded for now.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.467
It's got some troubles that
we can easily take care of,

32:51.533 --> 32:54.233
but I couldn't find them
till I actually got out
and ran the thing.

32:58.967 --> 33:00.033
About this time of year
we usually have

33:00.100 --> 33:01.967
a pretty big pile of firewood.

33:02.033 --> 33:03.167
Haven't had a chance
to replace it yet,

33:03.233 --> 33:05.000
so this is my first chance
to go out

33:05.067 --> 33:07.367
and go get another
fresh batch of firewood.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.300
Mmm, I'm gonna get some Umaks.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.267
I'm gonna get some woods,
willow woods.

33:30.867 --> 33:33.033
They're good hard-burning,
they're dry,

33:33.100 --> 33:34.700
they're easily available

33:34.767 --> 33:37.667
and they're a lot thinner
than trying to chop
a whole spruce log up.

33:38.533 --> 33:39.567
(GROANS)

33:43.100 --> 33:45.400
When you work for yourself
and you're self-employed,

33:45.467 --> 33:47.733
I tell myself to get up
and get firewood.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.833
I tell myself when to get up
and go and when to stay home.

33:52.367 --> 33:54.833
I make those decisions
and if I make a wrong decision

33:54.967 --> 33:57.000
and I get cold,
I gotta live with it

33:57.067 --> 33:58.533
and since
everybody's counting on me,

33:58.600 --> 33:59.633
I gotta deal with it.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.900
I've seen people
do crazy things for heat,

34:02.967 --> 34:05.067
even burn their clothes
and boots.

34:05.133 --> 34:07.267
I'm not gonna get
that far down.

34:09.900 --> 34:13.100
Hopefully the ladies
have gotten pretty far
on their parkies. I'll go see.

That looks really cool.

34:32.633 --> 34:33.633
Wow.

34:33.733 --> 34:36.033
That's the best overcoat
I ever saw

34:36.367 --> 34:37.600
and it'll fit right over
your other parka,

34:37.667 --> 34:38.700
that's the best thing
about it.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.600
We'll be safer
in the deeper cold.

34:40.667 --> 34:41.800
If we break down,

34:41.867 --> 34:43.633
that's the kind you can
curl up and sleep in,

34:43.700 --> 34:45.700
in the middle of the night
on your way home.

34:45.767 --> 34:47.067

helped out a lot, I'm sure.

with our work.

It's nice for me to know
she's able to make parkas

34:56.067 --> 34:58.300
and sew with sinew
we've made by ourselves

34:58.367 --> 35:00.800
and it's something
I learned from my mum

35:00.867 --> 35:03.033
and it's nice to be able
to pass it down to her

35:03.100 --> 35:04.333
and hopefully she'll be able

35:04.767 --> 35:07.800
to pass her
craftsmanship to her children.

35:07.933 --> 35:10.033
We'll have to wait
till it warms up
and we'll check out

35:10.100 --> 35:11.867
your snow machine
and see what parts you need.

35:11.967 --> 35:13.467
For now, we're double riding?

35:13.567 --> 35:14.733
For now,
we'll just double ride.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.067
(LAUGHS)

35:16.467 --> 35:18.200
To me,
winter's officially here.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.400
I went out
and got a bunch of firewood.

35:23.133 --> 35:24.967
Got some good clothing made
for the deep cold.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.100
Got to go travel around
and look around

35:27.167 --> 35:28.933
and just be outside again.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.167
These are things we do
to get ready for winter.

35:31.233 --> 35:32.400
It's our way of getting ready.

35:32.467 --> 35:35.567
You know, it's preparations
for the deep cold.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.400
So to me, winter's just begun.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.600
GLENN: There's so much
to learn out here.

35:45.667 --> 35:47.567
Life's going by and you only
got one chance at it.

35:53.567 --> 35:54.867
Nice big tree.

35:54.933 --> 35:56.067
(SNIFFLES)

35:56.633 --> 35:58.600
Probably put
my tent right here.

35:58.667 --> 36:02.333
NARRATOR: In the Brooks Range,
Glenn is setting up a new camp
away from his cabin.

36:02.733 --> 36:05.467
The second camp is vital to
improving his travel limits,

36:05.533 --> 36:08.400
and the ability
to hunt animals
for meat and protein.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.167
I wanna face it south,
get the sun.

36:12.267 --> 36:13.967
What little sunlight there is.

36:14.867 --> 36:16.500
Face it right there,
I can get up in the morning,

36:16.567 --> 36:18.533
walk over
and take a look at the lake.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.033
This is the spot.

36:21.333 --> 36:24.200
The first thing I need to do
is to find some good,

36:24.267 --> 36:27.867
straight poles, cut 'em down
and build a tent frame.

36:29.733 --> 36:31.367
I personally
like this lifestyle

36:31.433 --> 36:34.800
because of the direct contact
with natural processes.

36:34.867 --> 36:36.400
I like to have
to learn these things

36:36.500 --> 36:40.067
and learn
how to take care of myself
in different situations.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.667
I've always liked
to operate on my own

36:42.733 --> 36:44.900
and I really enjoy
the autonomy out here.

36:45.467 --> 36:48.233
People are becoming
more and more restricted,
less and less free

36:48.300 --> 36:50.533
and out here, there's still
a lot of freedom.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.000
(GROANS)

36:56.367 --> 36:59.100
It's gonna be so nice
to see the smoke coming up
out of the chimney tonight.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.467
It's getting cold.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.200
I like to be comfortable
when I camp out.

37:02.267 --> 37:04.700
I got to get my stove set up
and get this thing heated.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.533
I got a lot to do still.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.033
It's, this is not
a simple process here.

37:12.867 --> 37:14.200
Now that I got
the tent all set up

37:14.267 --> 37:15.800
I just need to pick
some spruce boughs.

37:15.867 --> 37:19.667
These'll cover the floor.
Makes a nice soft
floor covering.

37:19.733 --> 37:22.667
Hey. Look at that.

37:22.733 --> 37:23.833
There's a grouse.

37:24.167 --> 37:26.500
(WHISPERS) In that tree,
there's a spruce grouse.

37:30.967 --> 37:32.000
(COCKS GUN)

37:34.333 --> 37:35.433
Hey, there it is.

37:40.900 --> 37:41.967
(GUNSHOT)

37:42.200 --> 37:43.200
(COCKS GUN)

37:47.400 --> 37:49.333
A lot of times,

37:49.400 --> 37:51.600
where there's one grouse
you'll find others.

37:51.767 --> 37:54.067
There's another one!
Right there!

37:54.933 --> 37:55.933
(GUNSHOT)

38:00.400 --> 38:02.600
I got 'em both.

38:04.167 --> 38:05.500
Two grouse for dinner.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.333
I got a nice view of that lake

38:07.400 --> 38:09.200
and I got some grouse
right here in my back yard.

38:09.267 --> 38:10.967
This is a nice spot down here.

38:11.067 --> 38:12.500
A lot of caribou sign around.

38:12.767 --> 38:16.233
That's the thing
I've learned out here,
is that if you're patient,

38:16.433 --> 38:18.267
nature always gives you
something to eat.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.767
Sometimes it's not what
you were expecting to find,
but you always find something.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.400
You just have
to take your time

38:24.700 --> 38:26.033
and be patient,

38:26.100 --> 38:28.533
and you will find
something out here.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.067
Got a cup,
got a little moose fat.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.767
I'm gonna melt that
on my stove.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.200
That'll be the fuel
for my lamp.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.900
Here's my fat.

38:45.233 --> 38:46.500
Pour it out

38:47.700 --> 38:51.233
and the moss
should absorb the fat

38:53.300 --> 38:54.700
like a wick.

38:58.300 --> 39:01.100
The fat's highly flammable.

39:01.167 --> 39:02.533
This is gonna take
a little time.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.567
Just have to be patient.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.167
What I like about this
is just the atmosphere,
it's very meditative.

39:08.233 --> 39:09.967
I like running
the little lamp,

39:10.033 --> 39:12.000
running my little woodstove.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.667
The scent
of the spruce boughs.

39:15.233 --> 39:17.733
This is what
life's really about,

39:17.800 --> 39:19.733
it's being able
to take time to enjoy it.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.867
Just to be able
to walk out at night,

39:21.933 --> 39:24.200
look up
at the auroras overhead.

39:24.333 --> 39:25.633
Just to be able
to spend some time

39:25.700 --> 39:27.233
adjusting the flame
on your lamp

39:27.300 --> 39:30.633
and not have to
think about anything else
if you don't want to.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.633
Nothing else really matters.
You got heat, you got light,

39:33.700 --> 39:35.933
you got a comfortable place
with a roof over your head.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.400
What more do you need?

39:43.200 --> 39:44.800
JESSIE: Every time
I push through that barrier,

39:44.867 --> 39:46.267
I know I can go further
and further.

39:46.633 --> 39:49.533
When you want
something bad enough
you can push through anything.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.933
Come on.

39:51.067 --> 39:52.267
Straight ahead.

39:58.533 --> 40:00.267
The dogs are looking strong,

40:00.333 --> 40:02.933
coming out of the checkpoint
like they rested well.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.933
They were eating well,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.367
they're all booted up
and their feet are doing good
and we're making good time

40:07.433 --> 40:09.233
on our way back
to the truck here.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.433
Ho. Ho.

40:13.033 --> 40:16.333
-A couple booties come off
and fix my lines up.
-(SQUEALS)

40:16.533 --> 40:18.700
Give the dogs
just a real quick rest here.

40:18.933 --> 40:21.467
Gotta keep the booties on
in these kind of conditions.

40:22.133 --> 40:25.800
This abrasive snow,
that's what's gonna

40:25.867 --> 40:27.500
tear their pads up.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.300
Good boys, good boys.

40:30.367 --> 40:32.067
Yeah, these two
are just real young dogs,

40:32.167 --> 40:35.367
and they're becoming
my main leaders
with their dad up here,

40:35.433 --> 40:37.567
so that's a huge deal.

40:37.633 --> 40:39.267
(TONGUE CLICKING) Good boy.

40:40.233 --> 40:43.133
Tate, he hasn't been acting
like his normal self.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.633
He's getting
kind of old maybe.

40:44.700 --> 40:47.400
Rather than burn him out,
just give him a good break.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.100
All right.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.167
Straight, straight ahead.

40:54.433 --> 40:56.967
The key thing is just to
be patient and attentive.

40:57.033 --> 40:59.267
Attentive to the dogs' needs

40:59.333 --> 41:02.633
and if you take care of them
they'll take care of you
and perform.

41:02.700 --> 41:05.167
I've learned a
lot of things from these dogs.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.200
Watching how they're as a pack
and how they treat each other,

41:08.267 --> 41:10.967
it transfers over to the way
I treat everybody around me.

41:11.033 --> 41:14.267
Every mile you learn
something about your dogs.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.333
Good dogs. Straight ahead.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.067
I'm gonna be finishing
right in the dark,

41:21.133 --> 41:23.933
so we nailed this run,
pretty much

41:24.033 --> 41:26.733
in our window of opportunity
of daylight in Alaska.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.533
All right,
we made it to the finish line.

41:35.767 --> 41:37.000
(DOGS BARKING)

41:37.100 --> 41:39.400
Dogs made it,
finishing strong.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.867
I'm one proud dad right now.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.467
Straight ahead.

41:44.533 --> 41:45.867
Straight ahead.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.233
That was awesome run.

41:51.533 --> 41:54.433
Fifty-one-mile run
under these dogs' belts.

41:54.500 --> 41:58.067
Look at you, boys.
You sure are learning, huh?

41:58.433 --> 42:00.133
Yeah. Thanks, Flash.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.967
You did a great job, buddy.
Yeah, you're a good boy.

42:03.267 --> 42:05.567
I've been on the trail
all day, all night,

42:05.633 --> 42:07.400
getting ready to come here.

42:07.833 --> 42:11.767
You know, taking care
of my dogs first
over myself, like,

42:11.833 --> 42:13.700
it takes a lot of energy,
so, I'm beat.

42:13.833 --> 42:15.333
I didn't get
to run hard in the race

42:15.400 --> 42:18.333
'cause I had to
set my team up for success and

42:18.433 --> 42:20.800
I can see the product
of my work here now

42:20.867 --> 42:22.533
and the dogs look great.

42:23.733 --> 42:27.367
I really didn't even know
what I wanted out of life
until I found these dogs.

42:27.433 --> 42:28.833
It's humbled me.

42:28.900 --> 42:31.733
It's really changed me
and changed who I am.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.233
I've had many errors and
many trials and tribulations
through this,

42:35.333 --> 42:37.533
but I persevere every time.

42:37.667 --> 42:39.700
I refuse to quit and give up

42:39.767 --> 42:40.967
and that's what

42:41.067 --> 42:43.067
builds in that dog team
from them being around me

42:43.133 --> 42:45.800
when we work together.
We share that attitude.

42:45.867 --> 42:48.633
I love dog mushing,
I love racing,

42:48.800 --> 42:50.600
I want
to succeed in the future.

42:51.367 --> 42:53.567
It's very important
that I just keep them healthy

42:53.633 --> 42:55.700
and happy, loving what they do

42:55.867 --> 42:57.233
and if we love what we do,

42:57.333 --> 43:00.233
then we're gonna
reach our full capability.
