00:02.878 --> 00:04.630
Previously on 90210...

00:04.672 --> 00:06.465
ADRIANNA:
I told you,
I slept with you in Vegas

00:06.507 --> 00:07.800
because I thought Dixon
and I weren't together.

00:07.842 --> 00:11.136
It's not gonna happen again.

00:11.178 --> 00:14.222
SILVER:
You know, I just wanted
to try this thing out on my own

00:14.264 --> 00:16.391
without any pressure,
no gossip, no anything,

00:16.433 --> 00:18.185
so I haven't told
any of my friends.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.270
I thought I'd take you someplace
kind of special.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.652
I just want you to love me!

00:26.694 --> 00:28.028
You are completely insane!

00:28.069 --> 00:29.321
Liam, wait.
Let me go!

00:29.363 --> 00:31.866
Liam, no!

00:31.907 --> 00:33.868
My name is Liam Court.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.744
Uh, I've just seen an accident.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.121
I'm sorry.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.415
I, uh...

00:40.457 --> 00:42.417
I think I've made a mistake.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.426
Remember, you can run,
but you can't hide.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.680
Ashley Howard, LAPD.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.306
They assigned me
as your security detail.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.266
I just got an e-mail
from Bryce Woodbridge

00:58.308 --> 01:00.227
thanking me for hiring
her as the new CEO.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.062
You want to explain
to me what's going on?

01:02.103 --> 01:03.605
I want you to be happy.

01:03.647 --> 01:04.565
Told you about that video I took
from that kid

01:04.605 --> 01:05.941
at the Pop Up, right?
Sex tape?

01:05.983 --> 01:08.109
You're not gonna
do anything with that.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.364
This is for everything
that you put into the club.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.074
Please, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.450
Get the hell out.
If I ever see you

01:15.492 --> 01:17.536
in here again,
I will kick your ass.

01:29.924 --> 01:33.301
(pounding on door)

01:33.343 --> 01:35.596
(gasps)

01:35.637 --> 01:38.139
(panting)

01:38.181 --> 01:40.225
(knocking continues)

01:51.987 --> 01:53.363
Please don't kick my ass.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.282
I just, uh, uh...

01:55.323 --> 01:57.242
You okay?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.369
What do you want?

01:59.411 --> 02:00.412
It's your check

02:00.454 --> 02:02.330
for the money I put
into the bar.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.916
Hey, (sighs)

02:03.958 --> 02:06.794
I never wanted the whole world
to see that video, Liam.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.920
I feel awful.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.797
I'm sorry.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.883
If I could build a time machine,
I'd take it back to that day

02:12.925 --> 02:14.927
and erase
every stupid mistake I've made.

02:14.969 --> 02:18.346
Yeah, well, the only thing
you can do now

02:18.388 --> 02:20.307
is get the hell out of here.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.059
Liam, come on.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.898
Some things you can't
forgive and forget.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.155
Hey, babe, check it out.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.033
Your lawyer
just sent over the contracts.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.743
I am now the head
of my own record label,

02:39.785 --> 02:43.080
about to sign a rising star
who just happens to be my girl.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.457
We should take a picture.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.667
Dixon, I have bed head.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.418
I have cereal in my teeth.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.878
Okay, that doesn't matter.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.755
Okay, look, when we make it big,

02:51.797 --> 02:54.008
we're gonna remember the times
that we kept it real, okay?

02:54.049 --> 02:55.300
Okay.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.718
(kisses)

02:56.760 --> 02:59.930
Okay.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.059
Music history
has just been made.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.769
Wow.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.146
Looks so official,
doesn't it?

03:07.186 --> 03:08.814
What do you think
we should call the company?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.398
I don't know.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.318
Dixon's Record Label?

03:15.278 --> 03:16.738
Stick to singing, okay?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.323
(laughter)

03:18.365 --> 03:19.825
No, actually, you
know who's, like,

03:19.867 --> 03:21.618
kick ass at this kind of thing?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.745
Taylor.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.289
I should give him a call,
find out what he thinks.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.207
No.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.626
I mean, this is our thing.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.379
We don't need anybody's help.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.007
Absolutely right.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.970
♪ ♪

03:59.364 --> 04:00.866
See, when you do it,

04:00.908 --> 04:02.117
it's the art of burlesque.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.785
When I do it,

04:03.827 --> 04:05.787
I'm just another girl trying
to dance.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.372
I'm very flattered,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.624
but that better not be
the reason you're quitting.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.544
No, um,
my fertility specialist called.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.588
They said that I have
two healthy embryos

04:14.629 --> 04:16.214
in the freezer
whenever I'm ready.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.091
And you're ready?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.510
Probably not.
(laughs)

04:20.552 --> 04:22.763
You know, I started dancing

04:22.804 --> 04:25.265
because between trying
to get pregnant

04:25.306 --> 04:27.267
and having the BRCA gene,

04:27.308 --> 04:29.519
I just felt like my body
was out of control.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.105
Dancing has been

04:31.146 --> 04:33.690
this great way of pretending

04:33.732 --> 04:35.734
that I'm this sexy,
powerful woman

04:35.776 --> 04:37.527
who isn't afraid of anything.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.613
I just wish it were true.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.408
ANNIE:
Okay,

04:43.450 --> 04:45.119
I got your hysterical
voice mail,

04:45.160 --> 04:46.161
and dug up my high
school yearbook.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.163
Dixon's West Bev sweatshirt.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.124
Full disclosure, he said
it was full of memories,

04:50.165 --> 04:53.585
which may or may not mean he
wore while losing his virginity.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.796
Ew. Remind me not to walk
under a black light.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.005
So what is this all about?

04:57.047 --> 04:58.215
Are you familiar

04:58.257 --> 05:00.175
with the Ladies of West
Bev Legacy Society?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.219
Uh, yeah, that high school
alumni group?

05:02.261 --> 05:05.097
And super elite club for
the most powerful women

05:05.139 --> 05:06.306
in Beverly Hills.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.766
They throw
the most important parties.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.601
I mean, if the president comes
in to town,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.686
the Legacy ladies
are his first stop.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.063
And they asked you to join?

05:13.105 --> 05:14.606
Yeah, not yet.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.442
Gwen Thompson called to
talk, which can only mean

05:17.484 --> 05:19.736
they are interested
in me for membership.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.321
(chuckles)

05:21.362 --> 05:23.157
Max, what happened to
wearing West Bev colors?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.117
I told you I need to
show school spirit.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.743
I can't wear
a royal blue suit to work.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.954
I mean, I'll look like a guy
from Million Dollar Listing.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.330
Look, I know this
is a big day for you,

05:30.371 --> 05:32.540
but unless it's bigger than
the merger Bryce put together,

05:32.582 --> 05:33.917
I got to go.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.253
Data Nitrate's stock price is
about to go through the roof.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.796
(doorbell rings)
Mother-of-pearl, she's here.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.007
Fine. Go do your
little merger thing.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.176
Show Gwen in on your way out.
Thank you. Bye.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.303
(giggles)

05:44.343 --> 05:47.014
So I guess I will just be...

05:47.055 --> 05:48.389
Exhibiting school spirit.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.516
Sit.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.809
Okay.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.727
Now, the fight song
for West Beverly was...

05:52.769 --> 05:54.313
How did it go?

05:54.353 --> 05:56.190
♪ Oh, West Beverly... ♪

05:56.231 --> 05:57.691
That's the Canadian
national anthem.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.900
No one knows that.

05:58.942 --> 05:59.943
Oh, Mrs. Thompson.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.028
I almost forgot

06:01.069 --> 06:02.361
you were stopping by.
Please sit down.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.530
Please, Naomi,

06:03.571 --> 06:06.033
Mrs. Thompson
is my mother-in-law's name,

06:06.074 --> 06:07.993
so you can call me Gwen.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.620
Your home's adorable.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.873
Oh, it's just a starter.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.084
Gwen, this is my dear friend
Annie Wilson from high school.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.377
We were just actually going
over our West Bev yearbook,

06:18.419 --> 06:20.255
reminiscing about
the good old days.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.589
Amazing, isn't it?

06:21.631 --> 06:22.841
No matter how busy

06:22.883 --> 06:24.968
our lives get
with international travel

06:25.010 --> 06:26.469
and philanthropy,

06:26.511 --> 06:28.555
our days at West Bev
stay with us.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.724
It's almost embarrassing.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.851
So, what brings you by, Gwen?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.644
I'm not gonna beat
around the bush.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.771
We've had a spot open up...

06:36.813 --> 06:38.481
I accept. When do I start?

06:38.523 --> 06:40.901
(chuckles)
Well, I admire your enthusiasm,

06:40.942 --> 06:43.070
but you didn't let me finish.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.529
Right now,

06:44.571 --> 06:47.241
there are two women
we think might fit the bill.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.533
Two women?

06:48.575 --> 06:49.993
So it's like a contest?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.245
It's between you

06:51.286 --> 06:52.537
and Felicity Hathaway.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.332
She was a few years
ahead of you at West Bev.

06:55.374 --> 06:58.835
And, I mean, of course,
you're both beautiful, wealthy,

06:58.877 --> 07:00.087
dynamic,

07:00.128 --> 07:02.756
and married to young tycoons.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.549
So we will see
which one of you

07:04.591 --> 07:07.010
is West Bev Legacy Ladies
material.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.595
This weekend.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.972
This weekend?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.766
At the West Bev
Homecoming Alumni event.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.018
I mean, surely
you will be there.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.520
(chuckles)
As if I would miss that.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.315
Good.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.525
Oh, and, uh,
Felicity Hathaway

07:22.567 --> 07:25.112
is hosting a charity drive
at the alumni banquet.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.321
So, um,

07:26.363 --> 07:28.115
I don't know,
maybe find some fun way

07:28.156 --> 07:31.285
to dazzle us
at the football rally?

07:31.326 --> 07:32.660
I'm sure it'll be bangin',

07:32.702 --> 07:34.662
as the kids are saying
these days.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.789
(chuckles)

07:35.830 --> 07:37.665
See you then.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.293
Please tell me you're not
dragging us all

07:39.334 --> 07:41.336
back to high school
so you can fight it out

07:41.378 --> 07:42.503
for queen bee.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.256
Well, it's not gonna be a fight.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.883
It's gonna be a massacre.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.222
(theme music playing)

08:09.364 --> 08:11.992
Okay, everyone say,
"West Bev and cheese"

08:12.033 --> 08:13.285
so you smile.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.703
ALL: West Bev and cheese!

08:15.745 --> 08:17.705
(shutter clicks)

08:17.747 --> 08:19.458
Okay, okay, are
we done here?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.541
Did you win yet?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.336
No, I have to give
the picture to Gwen

08:22.377 --> 08:24.338
so she can see how popular
I still am.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.923
Then I have to take over
one of the day's events.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.009
Ooh, like this alumni
tree dedication ceremony?

08:29.050 --> 08:31.178
Lame and cancelled.
Get ready to cheer,

08:31.219 --> 08:32.511
because I'm going to make

08:32.553 --> 08:34.764
a dazzling donation
to the school.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.683
(chuckles) Felicity Hathaway
can eat my dust.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.559
We really are back
in high school.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.480
Yeah. Got to say,

08:41.520 --> 08:43.482
this place brings back
a lot of good memories.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.649
Like Liam dragging us out

08:44.691 --> 08:46.067
to my bachelor party when
I was marrying Ade.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.777
Do you remember that?

08:47.819 --> 08:49.863
Not really.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.040
Yeah.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.417
Good times.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.629
Okay, Naomi got her photo.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.922
Now we can go.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.674
Liam, I get paid to protect you

09:09.716 --> 09:11.718
so you can have some semblance
of a normal life.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.094
I'm sorry, I just...

09:13.136 --> 09:14.513
Crowds make me nervous.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.015
I keep feeling like someone's
lurking around, ready to pounce.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.725
Like that sleazy
photographer you punched?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.019
He's in jail.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.103
Are you serious? Since when?

09:22.145 --> 09:23.355
Since I did a
little digging.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.647
Turns out he's a deadbeat dad

09:24.689 --> 09:25.940
with a bench warrant.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.442
So I had him locked up.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.902
Now will you relax and enjoy

09:28.943 --> 09:30.362
being back in high school?
(scoffs)

09:30.404 --> 09:32.489
(girls talking excitedly)

09:32.531 --> 09:33.614
Ladies, give him some room
to breathe.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.575
Hi.
ANNIE:
So who were you then,

09:35.616 --> 09:38.578
who are you now, and what have
you done since high school?

09:38.619 --> 09:40.997
I have avoided people
that ask me questions like that.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.208
I'm sorry.
Naomi's making me do it.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.376
It's ridiculous, right?

09:44.418 --> 09:45.793
We graduated two years ago.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.295
So what if I thought
I'd be completing

09:47.337 --> 09:49.339
a prestigious theater program
by now?

09:49.381 --> 09:51.466
I'm not a loser
because I haven't done that.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.386
Or anything that
I'm remotely proud of.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.763
Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh,
Naomi may be onto something

09:56.804 --> 09:58.557
with this alumni thing.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.807
We have a lot
of heavy-hitters

09:59.849 --> 10:01.101
who went to this school.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.520
A VP from EMI,

10:03.562 --> 10:06.064
another exec
from a record label...

10:06.106 --> 10:08.483
Quincy Jones?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.360
Honey, no, not
the Quincy Jones.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.446
I'm pretty sure that
kid was in my gym class.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.407
Well, whoever it is, we've still
got to walk around and schmooze.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.699
Come on, let's go.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.159
All right, bye.
Have fun.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.161
WOMAN:
My turn for an interview?

10:20.203 --> 10:21.955
Cousin Emily?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.582
Surprise!

10:23.623 --> 10:24.916
More like painful shock,
actually.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.001
It's funny,
I never really thought

10:27.043 --> 10:28.462
of you as West Bev alum

10:28.503 --> 10:30.297
because you only went here
for what, like, a month?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.006
Oh, it's true,
but once a West Bevvy,

10:32.048 --> 10:33.258
always a West Bevvy.
Hi, guys.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.717
(chuckles)

10:34.759 --> 10:36.719
Besides, I was in town
on a press tour,

10:36.761 --> 10:39.514
and I heard it was homecoming,
so home I came.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.058
My agent thought it would
be perfect fodder for my blog.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.686
You have an agent and a
press tour and a blog.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.854
Wow.
Right?

10:46.896 --> 10:49.065
Like, the life
of a theater student at NYU

10:49.107 --> 10:51.901
who almost landed a role
on Broadway is so exciting.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.570
But for some reason,

10:53.612 --> 10:56.990
I have, like,
212,000 regular readers.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.325
Whoo!

10:58.366 --> 10:59.534
Isn't it great?

10:59.576 --> 11:01.995
Yeah, it's so great,
I want to kill myself.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.039
So... what have you
been up to since high school?

11:05.081 --> 11:08.709
Oh, you know, uh,
just keeping busy.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.712
I should probably
get back to it.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.133
Oh, my God.
Jasper?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.177
Who?
Just another
blast from the past.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.970
You know what, Emily?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.805
Why don't you
interview yourself?

11:20.847 --> 11:24.892
I'm sure you'd be much
better at it than I would.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.314
I can't believe

11:29.356 --> 11:30.982
Naomi sent a private plane

11:31.024 --> 11:33.067
to bring you back
to high school.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.569
Well, when you
use the words

11:34.611 --> 11:36.196
"Naomi" and "high school"
in the same sentence,

11:36.237 --> 11:38.156
I think pretty much
anything is believable.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.241
Ooh.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.409
Plus, I needed
to get out of town

11:41.451 --> 11:43.119
and clear my head, anyway.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.663
Why? What's wrong?

11:44.703 --> 11:47.332
Shane broke up with me for good.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.542
What?!

11:48.583 --> 11:49.792
Yup.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.169
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.087
I don't know why, but I...

11:53.129 --> 11:56.007
I always thought
he'd be the one.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.217
I guess I always
felt like he was

11:57.258 --> 11:59.844
the first guy you were truly
crazy about since Ian.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.596
Yeah, well,
when I got back to D.C.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.265
I tried to give it
another shot, but...

12:04.307 --> 12:06.643
he ended it out of nowhere.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.269
But enough about me

12:08.311 --> 12:10.188
and my non-existent
love life.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.148
How's the baby-making
stuff going?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.149
You taking good care
of my sperm?

12:13.191 --> 12:15.360
That did not sound right.
(chuckling)

12:15.402 --> 12:17.278
It's great.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.489
The doctor said I just need
to pull the trigger

12:19.531 --> 12:21.949
and I'll be pregnant.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.077
Which also
doesn't sound right.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.287
Well, I am glad

12:26.329 --> 12:27.830
you're getting
what you really want.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.749
One of us should.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.835
Hey, when we're
out of tennis balls,

12:32.877 --> 12:34.128
you want to break
into the high school

12:34.170 --> 12:35.963
and write "Shane is lame"
all over the lockers?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.632
Totally.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.095
I, of course, am Gwen Thompson.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.432
President of the Ladies
of West Bev Legacy Society.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.308
And it's my pleasure
to introduce

12:47.350 --> 12:50.353
fellow West Bev-er
Naomi Miller-Clark,

12:50.395 --> 12:53.690
who asked to make a very special
presentation today.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.276
(cheering)

12:58.903 --> 13:00.905
Thank you, Gwen.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.284
And thank you, West Beverly.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.577
It's so good to be back

13:05.619 --> 13:08.288
among the many, many people
who love me.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.832
Everything I have--
my career,

13:11.874 --> 13:14.001
my husband,
our subsequent wealth--

13:14.043 --> 13:17.046
it's all because
of my years at West Beverly.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.758
Which is why I decided...

13:19.798 --> 13:21.800
that I want to give
a little something back.

13:21.842 --> 13:22.927
(chuckles)

13:22.969 --> 13:25.305
And by "a little something,"

13:25.346 --> 13:27.641
I mean a colossal new building.

13:27.682 --> 13:31.269
I hope you are
as dazzled as I am

13:31.311 --> 13:36.149
by the future... Miller-Clark
Fashion Science Building.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.108
(applauding)

13:37.150 --> 13:39.026
(Naomi gasps)

13:40.528 --> 13:43.239
(applauding stops)

13:43.281 --> 13:45.366
(indistinct murmuring)

13:51.038 --> 13:54.041
ALEX:
Welcome home, West Beverly
Hills High Wildcats.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.378
It's the Halftime Powder Puff
Alumni Football game!

13:57.420 --> 13:59.589
Boys dressed as girls,
and girls kicking ass.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.841
Come on, dude.
Uh, okay, look.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.969
I never thought I'd say this
in a million years,

14:05.011 --> 14:07.888
but right now, I'm actually
pretty glad to be disabled.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.973
Come on, we used to do

14:09.015 --> 14:10.433
crazy stuff together
like this all the time.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.602
What?
What are you guys up for--

14:12.644 --> 14:14.395
a pyramid,
or a basic shoulder-sit?

14:14.437 --> 14:15.772
I'm down for whatever.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.069
GWEN:
That was so unfortunate

14:22.111 --> 14:23.446
about the banner, Naomi.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.781
Wasn't it, Felicity?

14:24.823 --> 14:26.073
So unfortunate.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.660
But at least it'll give us
all something to talk about

14:28.702 --> 14:30.119
at my banquet
this evening.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.873
I cannot believe Felicity
would stoop to something so...

14:33.914 --> 14:36.042
juvenile and unladylike.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.335
High school made us

14:37.377 --> 14:40.254
the strong and successful
women we are today.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.631
We didn't get there
by rolling over

14:41.673 --> 14:45.134
and playing nice with
the competition, did we?

14:49.347 --> 14:52.975
NAVID:
West Beverly, ho!

14:53.017 --> 14:54.352
Beverly West, ho!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.688
(laughing)

14:59.023 --> 15:02.610
Diet ginger ale,
right?

15:02.652 --> 15:04.237
It's been a long
time, Annie,

15:04.278 --> 15:07.031
but some things you, uh,
you just never forget.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.701
I, uh... didn't
expect to see you.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.160
Ever again.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.204
I've been in town
for a couple months now,

15:13.246 --> 15:17.500
and I've actually been meaning
to call you... and Liam.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.711
I thought we could
get together

15:19.753 --> 15:22.046
and talk about, uh, old times.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.632
Yeah, I'm not really interested
in "old times."

15:24.674 --> 15:26.175
You know what?
Neither am I.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.177
Especially when there's
something a lot more interesting

15:28.219 --> 15:30.137
going on in the present.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.849
Look, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to Liam about.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.059
Three years ago,
you set his boat on fire.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.311
I don't think he really
wants to talk to you.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.897
Really? Because after
he beat the crap out of me,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.273
I kind of thought
he owed me one.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.566
Just tell him

15:41.608 --> 15:44.235
I have something
I think he will want to see.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.029
His future could depend on it.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.866
Wait...
Wait, what does that even mean?

15:49.908 --> 15:51.618
(helmets crashing,
girl shrieks)

15:51.659 --> 15:54.913
Oof.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.748
(whistle blowing)

15:56.790 --> 15:58.458
(girl groaning)

15:59.667 --> 16:00.835
Naomi!

16:00.877 --> 16:01.961
Oh, sorry.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.254
You're supposed
to blocking.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.589
I thought this was supposed
to be touch football.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.340
Oops.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.218
FELICITY:
She did that on purpose!

16:09.260 --> 16:10.970
That banner
was an understatement.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.555
Poor Felicity.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.056
You're babbling, honey.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.683
Check in with the nurse, okay?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.394
And don't worry-- I will
take over your banquet

16:18.436 --> 16:19.771
and make it
unforgettable.

16:19.813 --> 16:23.691
ANNOUNCER:
Illegal use of the hands
on the offense...

16:35.995 --> 16:37.413
Shane.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.957
What are you doing here?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.374
Sorry to bother
you, but...

16:40.416 --> 16:41.584
I need to talk to Teddy.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.628
After the way
you broke up with him,

16:43.670 --> 16:46.297
I'm not sure Teddy
wants to talk to you.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.048
Is that what Teddy told you?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.426
Silver, when Teddy
got back to D.C.,

16:50.468 --> 16:52.219
I told him I wanted
a serious relationship.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.429
No more living separate lives.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.055
He said he
understood,

16:55.097 --> 16:56.891
and then just stopped
returning my calls.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.810
What?
Why would he do that?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.770
And why would he lie about it?

17:00.812 --> 17:02.188
I don't know.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.858
But I'd like a chance to talk
to him and find out.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.068
It must be weird being
back at high school

17:08.109 --> 17:09.904
after everyone in the world's
seen your movie, huh?

17:09.945 --> 17:13.366
Uh, Corporate Invaders,
not the other one.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.367
Yeah.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.742
Yeah, I got you.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.078
Yeah, I guess
it's nice, uh,

17:18.119 --> 17:19.789
going back and having

17:19.830 --> 17:21.540
all the teachers
who used to hate me

17:21.582 --> 17:23.291
suddenly kissing my ass.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.251
(chuckles)

17:24.292 --> 17:25.627
You know,
the Media Studies teacher

17:25.670 --> 17:26.963
actually asked me to come back
and be a guest speaker.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.255
Really?
Yeah.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.799
Because of
Corporate Invaders,

17:29.841 --> 17:31.384
not the other one.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.219
I'm pretty sure.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.220
(chuckles)

17:34.261 --> 17:36.138
So, I guess Navid's
little screwup

17:36.180 --> 17:37.891
didn't ruin your
life after all, huh?

17:37.932 --> 17:39.308
Do not ask me to forgive Navid.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.810
He crossed a line.
I know.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.353
I know. I get it.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.480
It's just, you know,
of all the things in the world

17:44.522 --> 17:47.859
I wish I could leave behind,
friends aren't one of them.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.652
(phone ringing)

17:49.694 --> 17:51.070
I bet it's the principal.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.698
She probably wants
to name a wing after me.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.282
Hello?

17:55.324 --> 17:57.076
DISPATCHER:
911, what's your emergency?

17:57.117 --> 17:58.369
Uh...

17:58.411 --> 17:59.662
LIAM:
My name is Liam Court.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.581
Uh, I've just seen an accident.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.123
I'm sorry, I, uh...

18:03.165 --> 18:05.334
I think I made a mistake.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.556
NAOMI:
Let's give a West Bev welcome

18:18.598 --> 18:20.224

throws the best alumni event

18:51.338 --> 18:52.506
in the history of West Beverly.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.217
Did you actually just walk
through your own party

18:55.259 --> 18:56.970
praising yourself
in the third person?

18:57.011 --> 18:58.930
Someone's got to do it.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.515
I took that banquet that
Felicity was going to throw

19:01.557 --> 19:03.851
in the school gym and turned it
into the party of the century.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.728
Yeah.
And I have so much
more to do.

19:05.770 --> 19:06.854
After the band plays,

19:06.896 --> 19:08.564
I have to introduce
the burlesque performers,

19:08.606 --> 19:10.149
kick off a lingerie
fashion show for charity...

19:10.190 --> 19:12.234
Are you sure that it's
worth doing all this

19:12.276 --> 19:13.820
just to get into a club?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.571
Yes, I am.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.116
And not just for
my own healthy ego.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.618
The connections I make
with the West Bev Legacy Ladies

19:20.660 --> 19:22.120
will help
your career, too, honey.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.412
Uh, my career doesn't need help.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.831
That was Bryce on the phone.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.248

19:26.290 --> 19:27.500

of the new board of directors.

at the Playboy Mansion

20:30.855 --> 20:33.107
Silver,
you had no right.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.860
I have "best friend rights,"
especially when I see you

20:35.902 --> 20:38.237
pushing away someone,
that I know you care about,

20:38.278 --> 20:39.238
for no good reason.
I have a reason.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.950
Then what is it?
I'm scared, okay?

20:42.992 --> 20:45.285
The first relationship I had
with a guy was a disaster.

20:45.327 --> 20:49.082
I put my heart out on the line
and he completely betrayed me.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.457
Teddy, that was high school.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.500
Mm-hmm.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.086
Shane isn't Ian.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.504
And you can't live
your life in fear.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.799

That was easy.

You've been fearless

you have the BRCA gene,

21:06.432 --> 21:09.018
you decide to have a baby
and you barely break a sweat.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.271
You may not be
scared of anything,

I think when Liam Court wants
to skip the Playboy Mansion

21:37.755 --> 21:40.466
to check out an open house,
there is something wrong.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.884
Nothing's wrong.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.596
By the way, would you mind
putting your name on the lease?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.056
Why?

21:47.098 --> 21:49.433
I just don't want anyone
to know where I live.

21:50.768 --> 21:54.063
Uh, fans, stalker paparazzi.
Anyone.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.940
Liam, you have a cop bodyguard
to protect you,

21:55.982 --> 21:58.525
and I saw you being mobbed
by a couple cute fans earlier

21:58.567 --> 22:00.360
and you weren't complaining.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.322
So, tell me-- who are you
really hiding from?

22:03.363 --> 22:05.407
(sighs)

22:07.367 --> 22:08.702
Vanessa.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.412
If she is back, I
will personally...

22:10.454 --> 22:13.499
She's dead.

22:13.540 --> 22:17.461
We got into a fight
the night of Naomi's party.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.379
She tried to stop me
from walking away,

22:19.421 --> 22:22.675
and she slipped and she fell.

22:22.716 --> 22:27.429
It was an accident...
but I didn't try to help her.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.806
Oh, my God.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.474
I was sure
that no one knew.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.060
But apparently someone does.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.063
First I got a letter,
then the phone rang

22:36.105 --> 22:39.733
and someone played back
the 911 call.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.486
I guess someone's been
watching me for months.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.157
Okay, Jasper cornered me

22:46.199 --> 22:48.326
at the football game.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.911
He said that he's been
back in town for a few months

22:50.953 --> 22:52.788
and he has something for you.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.623
He also said that you owed him.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.460
Jasper.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.462
That feels like
it was a lifetime ago.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.922
Well, apparently,

23:01.964 --> 23:04.008
he's holding a grudge.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.055
And ambushing my ex-boyfriend
at a high school reunion

23:09.096 --> 23:10.348
seemed like such
a good idea.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.474
I'm sorry, I really thought
I could get through to him.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.768
I swear,
Teddy cares about you, Shane.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.771
He's just-- he's been hurt once,
and I think he's scared.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.066
He didn't want
anyone to see it.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.067

29:39.945 --> 29:42.448
You're right, I do.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.784
And today was supposed to be
my triumphant return.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.077
At the tree dedication ceremony,

29:47.119 --> 29:49.037
I was going to unveil
the new me.

Sexy.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.429
You've never felt embarrassed
in your entire life.

If anyone deserves to be
in that snotty club, it's you.

This is a screenplay.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.925
Yeah, I'm in film school.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.051
I just won a big award,

my first real movie made.

30:48.806 --> 30:51.891
if I get a bankable actor
for the lead.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.560
The first scene
starts with

30:53.602 --> 30:56.438
a sleazy drug dealer
all bloodied up on the pier.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.108
He's pretty messed up,
until he discovers

31:00.150 --> 31:02.902
a talent that turns
his life around.

West Beverly's

32:08.176 --> 32:11.388
My true gift to West Beverly...

32:11.430 --> 32:13.014
is an apology,

32:13.056 --> 32:16.685
to anyone who I ever made

32:16.727 --> 32:22.399
to feel awkward or embarrassed
or vulnerable.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.444
Standing here right now,
I know how that feels.

I've done a lot of things
that I'm not proud of.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.575
And I can't take
those things back.

32:31.617 --> 32:36.705
I've learned that being popular,
being prom queen,

32:36.747 --> 32:40.125
joining the most elite club
in the city--

32:40.166 --> 32:44.671
none of that matters if you have
to step on people to get there.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.382
I know this
because I'm not the same girl

32:47.424 --> 32:50.803

and I'm glad.

32:50.844 --> 32:54.640
Because high school...

32:54.681 --> 32:56.767
was really lame.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.351
So, here I stand,

a former bitch,
asking for your forgiveness.

33:01.939 --> 33:05.484
Please don't let
the message get lost

I'm physically perfect.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.530
WOMAN:
Not good enough!

33:10.572 --> 33:14.534

take the thousands of dollars

"Unfaithful Records."

board of directors

35:55.361 --> 35:58.657
voted unanimously
to approve the merger.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.242
And then they voted to fire me.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.495
What?
Well, it turns out

36:03.536 --> 36:05.872
Bryce engineered the merger
so that I would lose

36:05.914 --> 36:08.125
my majority stockholder status.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.128
And then she convinced
the new board of directors

36:11.169 --> 36:13.421
that the company
had outgrown me.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.840

Some of the biggest mistakes
you make in life

36:34.651 --> 36:37.112
are out of love.

36:37.154 --> 36:40.239
The first time Patterson
whisked me away in a helicopter

36:40.281 --> 36:43.201
for a private picnic,
I thought I might be in love.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.620
But after our first
night together,

36:45.662 --> 36:49.708
I woke up and found
a check for $10,000.

36:49.749 --> 36:53.419
And I knew love had a price.

36:57.924 --> 37:00.802
Some guy wants to talk to you.
You want me to get rid of him?

37:02.929 --> 37:04.556
Nah, I'll take care of it.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.017
Okay.
I'll wait in the car.

quite the homecoming, huh?

37:19.905 --> 37:21.656
Yeah, don't remind me.

37:21.698 --> 37:24.201
Look, I get that you
might hate me forever.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.120
And that there's really
nothing I can do about it...

37:27.162 --> 37:29.247
but this.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.709

Well, I released a very
private sex tape of you.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.380

thing to me.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.591
You made a sex tape?

37:39.632 --> 37:42.385
