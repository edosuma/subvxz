onBlack Lightning...

00:03.133 --> 00:04.961
An anonymous donor
has offered to fund

00:05.005 --> 00:07.485
the relocation of the clinic
from this gang-infested area.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.966
[reporter] Councilman Parker,
who is it? Who is the donor?

00:10.271 --> 00:12.838
If you haven't
figured it out yet,
you work for me. [laughing]

00:12.882 --> 00:17.104
I ran a new simulation
and I may have found a way
to save all of them.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.148
It's working.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.762
[Dr. Jace] I told you
what you needed to hear.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.677
Fourteen of the vaccine kids
will survive.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.332
Something happened
tonight, Jeff.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.031
Gambi was attacked
near downtown Freeland.

Eyewitnesses confirm
no one got out of the SUV
before it exploded.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.222
Anaya, aren't you excited
it's almost over?

00:48.265 --> 00:50.833
Uh, actually, I...
I'm terrified.

00:50.876 --> 00:53.227
I just need you to do your job
so we could be on our way--

00:53.270 --> 00:54.358

She knows!
You have to save the baby!

01:02.192 --> 01:03.541

no, no, no, Deacon!

01:07.806 --> 01:09.330
[police siren wailing]

01:09.373 --> 01:10.809
Long way from home, missy.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.073
There's a woman who lives
out here I need to check on.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.639
Step out of the car.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.817
Oh, hell no!

01:36.357 --> 01:38.272
[kettle whistling]

01:47.150 --> 01:48.804
I want you to
listen carefully.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.588
There's something
out there that is of my body

01:50.632 --> 01:53.025
but out of my control,
I can feel it.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.115
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't know what that means.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.553
Seriously? You?

01:58.596 --> 02:00.337
You don't know
what that means?

02:01.686 --> 02:04.602
Jake, you told me
that I could depend on you

02:04.646 --> 02:06.952
to anticipate, to execute.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.912
It means everything I built
is being threatened.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.830
How long have you been
a part of me?

02:14.873 --> 02:16.223
It's been a while.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.661
It's been five years, Jake.
I made you special.

02:19.704 --> 02:23.186
-Look, I'm grateful,
Looker, I am.
-You should be.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.448
When I first came
to South Freeland,

02:24.492 --> 02:27.408
all of you were weak,
destroyed,

02:27.451 --> 02:29.279
addicted to opioids and meth

02:29.323 --> 02:31.194
and anything else that
you could get your hands on.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.761
Now you live comfortably.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.937
You eat well.
Your veins are clean.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.418
And all I'm asking for
is a little appreciation

02:37.461 --> 02:40.203
for you to do what I need done
without excuses!

02:40.247 --> 02:42.249
[gasps]

02:42.292 --> 02:45.600
You didn't help us.
You made us slaves.

02:45.643 --> 02:46.905
You're worse than the drugs,

02:46.949 --> 02:48.951
you know, you're worse
than the Perdi.

I want you
to follow the element.

03:10.364 --> 03:13.758
Follow the senses I gave you.
I want to know what this is.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.240
[clanks]

03:24.291 --> 03:25.292
You're still here?

03:26.118 --> 03:27.685
-I am.
-[laughs dryly]

03:30.297 --> 03:32.037
[exhales heavily]

03:32.777 --> 03:34.344
This is very unprofessional.

03:34.388 --> 03:39.001
You come to my home, you do
this in front of my family.

They'll get over it.

Last time.
Who hired you to kill me?

03:46.182 --> 03:48.228
I don't know who hired me.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.492
I got paid. I did the job.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.016
Obviously,
you didn't do the job,

03:54.059 --> 03:56.497
-or you wouldn't
be sitting there.
-[sighs]

-Where'd you get the money?
-It's not money, it's Bitcoin.

It's all done online.

04:03.721 --> 04:07.421
Come on, man,
you know how this is done.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.162
You're right, I do.

Lynn, what's going on?

04:37.581 --> 04:39.191
She lied to me.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.672
Who lied?

04:43.195 --> 04:44.327
Dr. Jace.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.983
She cooked the data
to make it look

04:48.026 --> 04:50.855
like the pod kids
wouldn't have
any adverse reactions.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.814
I let it happen.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.775
We lost 14 lives, Jeff.

04:58.776 --> 05:03.259
Brothers, sisters,
sons, daughters.

05:04.608 --> 05:08.308
Fourteen kids died
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

05:10.571 --> 05:11.963
All I could do was just...

05:14.531 --> 05:16.577
stand there
and watch them die.

Tobias was still here.

And we always knew
Tobias was runnin'
The One Hundred.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.702
And I knew it was him
and The One Hundred
that tried to kill me.

-Reverend Holt, if you just--
-Hold on now, listen to me.

If I'm wrong...

Now, if I'm right,

he can keep his money...

take your money
and build another clinic?

how to run my business?

Look, killing the reverend
who you're trying to buy
a building from

13:35.292 --> 13:38.034
Of course she's okay.
How do you know
our daughter?

13:38.078 --> 13:39.906
She came into the clinic
where I work.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.256
Ma'am, I just wanna
make sure she's okay.

13:42.299 --> 13:45.389
We appreciate your dedication,
but she's fine.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.000
No, she's not.
She's in danger.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.176
She's in danger.
What kind of danger?

13:49.219 --> 13:50.830
I'm not sure, but...

13:54.050 --> 13:55.399
Anaya, I'm sorry...

13:58.750 --> 14:00.143
but Deacon is dead.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.188
[gasps]

14:01.753 --> 14:02.885
[Anaya] Deacon?

14:03.581 --> 14:05.105
[Anaya stifles sob]

14:09.326 --> 14:10.980
[Anaya gasping]

14:12.460 --> 14:13.940
[groaning]

14:15.419 --> 14:17.160
[Anaya wheezing]

14:17.204 --> 14:18.640
What's the matter, baby?

14:18.683 --> 14:20.642
She's going into labor.
We need to get her to a bed.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.036
Here, help her get to bed.
Help her.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.908
It's okay, baby.
Mommy's right here.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.659
[tires screeching]

14:37.702 --> 14:39.400
-[thud]
-[gasps]

14:44.448 --> 14:46.146
-Hey!
-[gasps]

14:46.189 --> 14:47.538
Is she alive?

14:47.582 --> 14:48.800
Is she alive?

14:48.844 --> 14:51.064
I'm sorry!
I don't know, I'm sorry.

14:51.107 --> 14:54.241
Is she dead? Miss? Miss?
No, is she dead?

14:54.284 --> 14:56.243
Please! Please! Miss! Miss!

14:56.286 --> 14:57.635
Miss!

14:57.679 --> 14:59.159
Miss!

15:01.291 --> 15:02.771
[crying]

15:06.079 --> 15:07.080
[sighs]

15:08.168 --> 15:09.909
[Khalil sighs]

15:12.999 --> 15:14.957
[Jennifer] Look, I know
you didn't come
all the way up here

15:15.001 --> 15:17.438
just to sit next to me
and not say nothing.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.961
Is that what we're doing now?

15:21.659 --> 15:23.444
Khalil, what's wrong?

15:26.142 --> 15:29.145
[sighs] Tobias is the reason
why I was paralyzed.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.495
What?

15:32.714 --> 15:34.934
He was behind
the reverend getting shot.

15:36.457 --> 15:37.980
Oh, God.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.896
[scoffs]

15:40.940 --> 15:43.812
All this time I've been
blaming Black Lightning.

15:45.118 --> 15:48.425
And now Tobias,
he wants me to
kill the reverend.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.340
[scoffs]

15:50.384 --> 15:52.908
Khalil, why are you
still staying with him?

15:52.952 --> 15:55.171
Jen, look at the choices
that I made.

15:56.694 --> 15:59.132
It's not like I have
anywhere else to go.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.964
-[sighs]
-I'm sorry you have to deal
with all this alone.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.838
Hey, we'll figure it out.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.975
Yo, why are you even
giving me the time of day?

16:18.673 --> 16:21.502
This whole Painkiller thing
is not you.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.069
We've all been through a lot.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.029
Plus, I don't want you to
make any more mistakes,

16:27.073 --> 16:30.946
'cause you've made
some bad decisions this year.
Like, really bad.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.734
I also made
some good ones, too.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.998
[laughing]
Oh, yeah? Like what?

16:48.094 --> 16:50.531
All right, Anaya,
push for me one more time.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.534
Anaya, push for me,
okay? Push!

16:53.577 --> 16:55.275
-[grunting]
-Push, Anaya!

16:55.318 --> 16:57.320
[screaming]

16:57.364 --> 16:59.366
Yes! Push!

17:00.932 --> 17:02.891
Push! Push for me!

17:02.934 --> 17:04.240
[Batina]
You're doing pretty good.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.416
-[crying]
-[Anissa] Okay, okay. Okay.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.550
-All right. Okay. Breathe.
-I'm right here, okay?

17:09.593 --> 17:11.465
[baby wailing]

17:11.508 --> 17:12.814
[Batina exclaims in delight]

17:12.857 --> 17:14.381
You did it. You did so good.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.129
[Batina laughing]

17:25.696 --> 17:27.089
Okay, okay.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.139
Hi. Hi, baby!

17:33.182 --> 17:36.272
[gasps, screaming]

17:36.316 --> 17:38.318
-[Batina] What's wrong?
-I don't know. I don't know.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.581
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. I don't know.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.104
[wails]

17:43.627 --> 17:44.802
[Batina] Is she all right?

17:44.846 --> 17:45.934
[panting]

17:45.977 --> 17:48.110
[continues wailing]

17:48.154 --> 17:50.243
[stutters] She's still
having contractions!

17:51.070 --> 17:52.767
[gasping violently]

17:52.810 --> 17:56.031
Oh, my God!
She's having twins!

17:59.295 --> 18:01.036
[sighs] Anissa?

18:02.168 --> 18:04.039
[monitor beeping]

18:10.176 --> 18:11.351
What are you doing?

18:18.227 --> 18:19.620
[exhales]

18:21.317 --> 18:23.189
Is that apple juice?
[chuckles]

18:23.232 --> 18:26.322
I'm not in the mood
for your smart little mouth,
little girl.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.108
Sorry.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.286
[Jennifer clears throat]

18:33.329 --> 18:36.158
Those families
think I'm some kind of
government sellout.

18:36.202 --> 18:40.075
Well, that's how people
looked at me in school.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.338
"The Queen of Garfield."
And I hated it.

18:42.382 --> 18:45.646
But I knew they were wrong.
So I just ignored 'em.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.126
Maybe you should
do the same thing.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.173
I wish it was that easy.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.263
The baby is breech.
And it's stuck in
the back of the uterus.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.831
I need you to apply pressure.
Right here.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.181
-Okay.
-Just like this. Okay?

19:08.930 --> 19:10.627
What the hell
are you doing?

19:14.675 --> 19:15.676
What?

19:20.028 --> 19:22.335
You and Dad
told me and Anissa

19:22.378 --> 19:25.381
to always be honest
and take responsibility
for our actions.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.687
Yeah.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.254
And even though I didn't ask
for these powers,

19:28.297 --> 19:31.387
it's still my responsibility
to control them, right?

19:31.431 --> 19:33.172
What are you trying to say?

19:35.435 --> 19:37.263
[sighs] Okay,
if we're being honest,

19:37.306 --> 19:39.613
it wasn't your fault
those kids died.

19:39.656 --> 19:44.095
But technically, as the person
in charge of the facility,

19:44.139 --> 19:46.228
it was your responsibility
to keep them safe.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.621
So once again,

19:47.664 --> 19:50.406
even though it was
not your fault that they died,

19:50.450 --> 19:53.627
they kinda were
your responsibility.
You see what I'm saying?

19:54.584 --> 19:55.759
Wow. [chuckles]

19:57.283 --> 20:00.416
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.071
Wait, Mom.
Mom, that's not...

20:04.377 --> 20:06.335
-You got it, baby! You got it!
-Breathe!

20:06.379 --> 20:08.729
-That's my strong girl!
-[Anissa] Breathe! Breathe!

20:08.772 --> 20:10.078
Breathe!

20:10.121 --> 20:11.253
[gasps]

20:12.254 --> 20:14.300
[baby crying]

20:22.308 --> 20:24.527
[Anissa] There you go,
there you go.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.358
Okay.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.239
Here's your baby. Okay.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.241
You did it, Anaya.

21:14.490 --> 21:15.622
[Joshua] No.

21:25.806 --> 21:26.850
[Batina] Joshua.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.289
What did you do?

21:34.118 --> 21:35.337
You killed Deacon?

21:36.077 --> 21:38.297
She chose his pale ass
over me?

21:39.472 --> 21:40.299
Me?

21:40.342 --> 21:41.778
You've just started a war.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.478
[breathing shakily]

21:49.003 --> 21:50.874
[baby fussing]

21:56.924 --> 21:58.491
[electrical humming]

21:58.534 --> 21:59.666
Whoa.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.381
[Lynn retches]

22:20.251 --> 22:21.514
[coughing]

22:21.557 --> 22:22.906
[sighs]

22:22.950 --> 22:24.560
[toilet flushing]

22:27.433 --> 22:29.348
[Lynn retching]

22:34.744 --> 22:36.920
[Lynn panting, sniffles]

22:39.314 --> 22:40.837
[toilet flushing]

22:49.498 --> 22:53.372
I could never let
half of those kids die,

22:54.590 --> 22:57.593
even if I knew
it would save the other half.

22:59.595 --> 23:02.859
When I look at them,
all I see is you and Anissa.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.687
I know, Mom.

23:06.689 --> 23:11.477
I would've tried to save
every single one of them.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.221
If we could've found a way
to save 14 lives,

23:17.265 --> 23:20.311
we could've found a way
to save all of them.

23:25.316 --> 23:26.970
Every single life mattered.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.452
Every single one.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.543
[crying]

23:37.503 --> 23:39.113
[Reverend Holt]
It's a good night out here.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.550
[chuckles] Ooh!

23:42.159 --> 23:43.552
My Lord!

23:44.118 --> 23:45.685
[speaks indistinctly]

23:45.728 --> 23:47.687
[humming]

23:47.730 --> 23:48.775
What the...

23:48.818 --> 23:50.385
Hey!

23:50.429 --> 23:52.126
If you don't leave Freeland
tonight, you are going to die.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.562
Well, let me
tell you something, boy.

23:53.606 --> 23:54.737
You better
take your hands off me...

23:54.781 --> 23:56.739
-[grunts]
-before I beat your-- [gasps]

23:57.740 --> 23:58.785
Okay?

23:58.828 --> 24:00.830
You think you're
a gangster now, huh?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.310
Huh?

24:02.353 --> 24:05.618
I knew ya mama when she was
pregnant with you, boy.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.881
Now, this ain't you, Khalil.
Now let me go.

24:09.665 --> 24:10.623
Huh?

24:10.666 --> 24:12.494
You have to leave Freeland!

24:12.538 --> 24:14.975
I ain't gotta do nothing
but stay black and die!

24:15.018 --> 24:16.846
[breathing heavily]

24:17.543 --> 24:18.892
[chokes]

24:25.681 --> 24:27.640
[continues choking]

24:30.686 --> 24:31.992
[Khalil grunts]

24:42.959 --> 24:45.571
So you can walk now, huh?

24:47.398 --> 24:49.488
But you walking down
the wrong path, Khalil.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.490
Come on, son.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.492
All these things
you doing out here
in the streets

24:53.535 --> 24:54.710
will tear your mother apart.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.630
It's too late for me.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.633
It's never too late.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.070
Not for Jesus.

25:08.637 --> 25:13.381
God will forgive you, Khalil.
You know he will.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.693
I wish Deacon
could've met them.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.086
I know it was too dangerous
for us to be together.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.828
I just want them to be safe.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.749
What is... What is Sange?

25:33.793 --> 25:37.753
White folks with powers
who basically
terrorize South Freeland.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.277
They call us the Perdi.

25:40.321 --> 25:42.628
So they call black folks
out here Perdi?

25:42.671 --> 25:46.022
Yeah. We lived with the whites
in South Freeland,

25:46.066 --> 25:49.809
them on their side,
us in the woods,
since the end of slavery.

25:49.852 --> 25:52.594
The Sange have been
running guns out
of South Freeland proper

25:52.638 --> 25:53.769
for the last 30 years

25:53.813 --> 25:55.423
while we've stayed
in the surrounding woods

25:55.466 --> 25:57.730
and made money
off of the land.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.470
So y'all really
live in the woods?

25:59.514 --> 26:04.040
Yeah. We're farmers.
We grow organic fruits,
vegetables, hemp.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.608
-Weed?
-That too.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.611
There's a lady who
calls herself Looker.

26:09.655 --> 26:12.701
My dad says
she came to town
about 30 years ago.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.574
And she has this silver,
what she calls, element.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.489
She used it to turn
the white folks into Sange.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.579
Is that the stuff
that came out of Deacon?

26:24.191 --> 26:26.628
And it's in the babies, too.

26:26.672 --> 26:32.460
In my father's eyes,
having a baby by a Sange,

26:32.503 --> 26:35.376
that's about the worst thing
I could do.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.291
Yeah, but I'm sure
he'll come around.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.815
No. This is serious, Anissa.

26:39.859 --> 26:43.950
My father hates white people,
especially the Sange.

26:43.993 --> 26:46.735
For as long as I can remember,
the Sange have hated us,

26:46.779 --> 26:49.390
and the Perdi have hated them.

26:49.433 --> 26:52.611
And now I'm having twins
with a Sange.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.615
My father will
never forgive me.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.879
[Anaya crying]

27:05.058 --> 27:06.755
[footsteps approaching]

27:18.027 --> 27:19.768
I didn't get the reverend.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.770
There were
too many people around.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.686
I'll get him next time.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.953
[Tobias] In the elite units
of the armed forces,

27:30.997 --> 27:34.870
there's a theory of operations
called "unit cohesion."

27:34.914 --> 27:37.873
According to this theory,
there's two types of cohesion.

27:37.917 --> 27:43.836
There's tactical,
or task cohesion,
and social cohesion.

27:43.879 --> 27:46.665
Tactical cohesion is defined
as a shared commitment

27:46.708 --> 27:48.623
amongst a group
to achieve a goal,

27:48.667 --> 27:52.409
while social cohesion
is how well the members
of that team get along.

27:52.453 --> 27:56.457
Now, the key to this theory
is keeping a balance
between the two.

27:56.500 --> 28:00.679
However, if one of
those components is
too far out of whack,

28:00.722 --> 28:01.810
the team breaks down.

28:01.854 --> 28:04.334
Well, unless
someone intercedes.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.728
Truth be told,
I owe you an apology.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.600
It's my fault you failed.

28:09.644 --> 28:12.778
Seems our social cohesion
has surpassed our tactical.

28:12.821 --> 28:15.432
The fact that
I'm fond of you has kept me

28:15.476 --> 28:18.827
from interceding
and disciplining you
the way that I should.

28:18.871 --> 28:20.742
And for that,
I am very sorry.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.745
But I promise you.
Oh, you have my word, Khalil.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.095
I won't ever
let it happen again.

28:27.401 --> 28:28.881
[Tobias grunts]

28:28.924 --> 28:30.883
I've been waiting
to beat your pasty ass.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.059
[both grunting]

28:45.462 --> 28:48.204
[grunts, laughs]

28:48.248 --> 28:49.945
You ain't as soft
as you look.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.080
[yells]

29:06.657 --> 29:08.703
[panting]

29:15.318 --> 29:17.190
[grunting]

29:30.203 --> 29:31.291
[grunts]

29:31.334 --> 29:32.901
Get your ass up.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.252
You all right, son?

29:38.211 --> 29:39.647
-[clangs]
-[groans]

29:42.693 --> 29:44.783
Get your ass up.

29:46.219 --> 29:51.877
You will kill Reverend Holt
and your mama!

29:52.529 --> 29:53.835
[chuckling]

29:55.315 --> 29:56.751
You all right? Huh?

29:56.795 --> 30:00.189
Or I will kill you!

30:05.194 --> 30:06.805
You smart-ass.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.502
[laughs]

30:08.545 --> 30:11.026
One way or the other,
you gonna learn. Yeah.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.032
[glass cracking]

30:19.121 --> 30:20.209
[shattering]

30:30.916 --> 30:33.092
You done broke
my damn fish tank.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.008
[breathing heavily]

30:37.923 --> 30:40.882
Looker is much stronger
than anyone
under her control,

30:40.926 --> 30:42.666
almost impossible to hurt.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.930
If Looker knew Deacon
and I have children,

30:44.973 --> 30:46.670
she will feel the same way
as my father.

30:46.714 --> 30:50.805
Deacon used to say
if the Sange and Perdi
were to intermingle,

30:50.849 --> 30:53.112
realize we have
more in common
than we don't,

30:53.155 --> 30:55.157
it would threaten
her control over town.

30:55.201 --> 30:58.117
He said most Sange
don't want the element.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.989
Do you think she'll
come after the babies?

31:03.078 --> 31:04.775
Yeah.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.256
Okay, okay.
Now I just want you
to get some rest. All right?

31:07.300 --> 31:09.998
You've been through a lot.
It's gonna be okay.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.057
I know you're
in your feelings right now,

31:25.100 --> 31:27.929
but we need to
get Anaya and those babies
out of the woods

31:27.973 --> 31:30.062
and somewhere safe
where we can protect them.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.940
Look, y'all are sitting here

31:38.984 --> 31:42.509
with your old-ass ideas
about who should be with who,

31:42.552 --> 31:45.077
but, you know, that's still
your daughter in there,

31:45.120 --> 31:48.167
and black or white,
those are
still your grandbabies.

31:48.210 --> 31:53.215
Now, you and Anaya
can work out your issues
after they're safe,

31:53.259 --> 31:57.306
but there won't be
any issues to work out
if they all die.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.923
Why do you care
what happens to this family?

32:06.011 --> 32:07.926
Because I was raised that way.

32:36.084 --> 32:39.131
If anything goes wrong,
we split up
and meet at the farmhouse.

32:39.174 --> 32:40.697
Each group is responsible

32:40.741 --> 32:42.786
for getting one of
the babies to Freeland.
Understand?

32:42.830 --> 32:44.049
[all] Copy.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.140
[air whooshing]

32:57.540 --> 32:59.107
[whooshes]

33:12.729 --> 33:15.036
[guns cocking]

33:19.954 --> 33:21.216
Took you long enough.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.392
We're gonna talk about this
later, young lady.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.662
[newscaster] The new
Park Street library
is going to be open...

33:32.706 --> 33:35.578
-[continues speaking
indistinctly]
-[laptop chiming]

33:55.381 --> 33:57.035
[indistinct yelling]

34:04.346 --> 34:05.347
[screams]

34:10.135 --> 34:11.223
[car engine starts]

34:29.197 --> 34:31.634
-[man 1] Come on, we gotta go!
-[man 2] Get in, let's go!

34:58.400 --> 34:59.140
[groans]

34:59.662 --> 35:00.663
[gun cocks]

35:05.015 --> 35:06.365
[gun cocks]

35:06.408 --> 35:07.148
[shouts]

35:08.454 --> 35:10.108
[gun fires]

35:10.804 --> 35:12.240
[man 3] Look out! Behind you!

35:32.521 --> 35:33.566
[men screaming]

36:06.425 --> 36:08.644
-Where's your parents?
-They haven't
made it back yet.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.211
-None of them have.
-The baby?

36:34.409 --> 36:35.889
[Anissa over comms]
I've got Anaya and the baby

36:35.932 --> 36:38.239
and we're headed for Freeland.

36:38.283 --> 36:41.155
-[Black Lightning]
I found something.
-What?

36:44.289 --> 36:46.421
Dad, what's going on?

36:46.465 --> 36:49.424
[sighs]
There's a lot of dead bodies.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.166
What about the baby?

37:01.088 --> 37:02.698
I don't see her.

37:02.742 --> 37:06.311
What about the grandparents?
Uh, her dad has grey locks,

37:06.354 --> 37:08.400
and her mom has
short hair like Mom.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.231
I don't see them either.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.676
There's something here...

37:26.156 --> 37:27.723
a silver liquid...

37:29.551 --> 37:32.206
-that's moving on its own.
-I think it's from Looker.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.860
Wait. What is that?

37:33.903 --> 37:36.036
This woman that
the babies' mother, Anaya,
told me about.

37:36.079 --> 37:39.822
Now, Anaya says that
this silver liquid
is like a part of Looker

37:39.866 --> 37:43.173
and she can put it inside of
people and make them Sange.

37:43.217 --> 37:44.479
Make them what?

37:44.523 --> 37:45.915
Sange.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.395
Like her slaves, basically.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.137
She also said
that this element,

37:50.180 --> 37:53.619
it gives the Sange
more speed and strength
than regular folks.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.447
Sounds like a meta.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.014
Anaya said she showed up
in South Freeland
about 30 years ago.

37:58.058 --> 37:59.755
Thirty years ago?

37:59.799 --> 38:03.629
So she might be one of
the original kids
infected by the vaccine.

38:03.672 --> 38:04.978
So she's just like you.

38:05.021 --> 38:08.329
What? No. I wouldn't say
just like me, but yeah.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.724
Wow.

38:11.767 --> 38:15.684
Sounds like I may not be
the only vaccine kid
who's been out and about.

38:15.728 --> 38:18.339
All right, Dad, look.
According to Anaya,

38:18.383 --> 38:20.689
this silver liquid
always returns to Looker.

38:20.733 --> 38:23.388
Now, if that's true,
you should be able
to follow it back to her

38:23.431 --> 38:26.478
and hopefully find the grandparents and the baby.

38:27.348 --> 38:28.654
This is some weird stuff.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.046
I know.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.484
Okay, get Anaya
and the other baby
to safety.

38:32.527 --> 38:34.137
-Anissa?
-[Anissa] Yeah?

38:34.181 --> 38:35.356
Good job.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.531
If you hadn't
shown up tonight,

38:36.575 --> 38:38.011
a lot more people
would be dead,

38:38.054 --> 38:39.404
including those babies.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.841
Thanks, Dad. Hey, Dad?

38:41.884 --> 38:43.364
-Yeah.
-Be careful.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.279
Yeah, always.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.502
What're you doing down there?

38:50.545 --> 38:52.155
[Khalil] Nothing.
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

38:52.199 --> 38:55.420
Okay. Well, you didn't
have to come
all the way here for that.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.031
Why are you acting so weird?
You okay?

38:58.074 --> 39:00.033
[Khalil] Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:00.076 --> 39:01.556
Khalil, come up here
so I can see you.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.603
Nah, I'm good down here.

39:04.646 --> 39:05.865
All right, boy, if you don't
stop playing with me,

39:05.908 --> 39:07.388
I'm going back inside
and I'm hanging up.

39:07.432 --> 39:10.043
Wait, wait. Don't do that.

39:10.086 --> 39:11.566
Then come up here.

39:16.571 --> 39:17.659
[sighs]

39:27.582 --> 39:29.454
Wait. You...

39:35.677 --> 39:36.504
What happened?

39:38.593 --> 39:40.378
Reverend Holt
won't leave Freeland.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.252
Jen, I'm not Tobias.

39:45.295 --> 39:47.689
I am not a killer.
That's not me.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.474
No, I know. I know.

39:52.825 --> 39:56.611
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

39:57.873 --> 40:00.876
Wait, why are you talking like
I'm not gonna see you again?

40:03.488 --> 40:05.315
-Look at you--
-No.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.552
[baby gurgling]

40:24.596 --> 40:26.859
What the hell am I supposed to
do with this thing?

40:39.524 --> 40:41.656
A Sange been lying
with a Perdi?

40:43.832 --> 40:44.833
Hmm?

40:51.579 --> 40:52.667
Who?

41:02.372 --> 41:03.765
Where's Deacon?

41:07.639 --> 41:10.642
One of the Perdi found out
the girl had a baby
by one of us.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.950
Killed him. Tried to make it
look like we did it.

41:16.691 --> 41:20.695
Lie down with the Perdi,
die like the Perdi, hmm?

41:30.052 --> 41:31.619
[baby cooing]

41:33.142 --> 41:35.493
[breathes deeply]

41:40.889 --> 41:41.934
[gasps]

41:43.718 --> 41:46.721
There's another baby.
A white baby.

41:52.248 --> 41:53.511
Find it.

41:55.948 --> 41:57.950
[closing theme music playing]
