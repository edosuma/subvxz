00:07.420 --> 00:09.080
I'd load up
on the carbs, Ravi.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.040
For our overnight hike,
and because I have no idea
what that meat is.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.170
Ravi, guess what?

00:15.170 --> 00:17.500
Mom and Dad are sailing up
the coast of Maine,

00:17.500 --> 00:19.250
and they're coming
to visit today!

00:19.250 --> 00:22.500
I am so excited to show Mom
my CIT skills.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.290
Sure, she's watched me
model in Milan,

00:24.290 --> 00:25.830
but she'll be
even more excited to watch me

00:25.830 --> 00:27.460
sing Boom-Chicka-Rocka
with nine-year-olds!

00:29.620 --> 00:33.250
I am so excited
I get to spend the day
with Mrs. Mommy!

00:33.790 --> 00:35.290

00:35.290 --> 00:36.290
I mean,
I guess Mom is "aight."

00:38.170 --> 00:41.330
Ravi, we're supposed to be
taking our campers
up to Glass Lake.

00:41.330 --> 00:42.750
Let me guess,
they call it that

00:42.750 --> 00:44.330
because the water
is as clear as glass?

00:44.330 --> 00:46.040
No, because it's full
of broken bottles.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.210
Come on, Ravi,
I really need you
on this hike.

00:50.210 --> 00:51.830
You need Ravi?

00:51.830 --> 00:53.000
Yes.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.210
He is a great CIT
and a natural leader.

00:55.210 --> 00:58.460
And he knows how to work
that GPS thing-a-ma-jig.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.500

Me? Related to the legendary
counselor, Christina Ross?
In my dreams!

01:15.120 --> 01:16.830
No. Seriously...
I've had that dream a lot.

01:18.790 --> 01:21.040
Uh, Mom,
this is my bestie, Lou!

01:21.040 --> 01:24.330

02:35.500 --> 02:38.330
Well, hired nannies to raise.

02:38.330 --> 02:41.080
Hey, Mom, want to

Oh, of course! I'd love to see
my girl in action.

Uh...

You.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.330
You don't remember me?

03:08.330 --> 03:10.290
You beat me
as Counselor of the Year

03:10.290 --> 03:12.000
four years in a row!

03:12.000 --> 03:14.540
I was first runner-up.

03:14.540 --> 03:16.580
Oh, good for you.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.920
So you're
still a counselor?

03:20.170 --> 03:23.120
No, I'm the owner!

03:24.620 --> 03:28.000
So, where is Morgan?
(CHUCKLES)

03:28.000 --> 03:30.670
I don't detect
his delicious musk.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.960
Unfortunately,
he threw his back out,

03:33.960 --> 03:37.250
so he's stuck on the yacht,
but he sends his love!

03:37.250 --> 03:38.670
He did?

03:38.670 --> 03:41.210
Well, tell him
I send it right back!

03:41.210 --> 03:42.210
(LAUGHS)

03:43.750 --> 03:46.120
I think that love
was meant for us.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.710
Oh.

03:47.710 --> 03:50.210
Ooh, there's a trophy
with my name on it!

03:51.620 --> 03:55.000
So Morgan is all alone
on his yacht?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.290
And he can't run away?

03:56.290 --> 03:58.250
We have Rottweilers.
With rabies.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.750
Is rabies like
"definitely die" bad,

04:01.750 --> 04:03.790
or, just like
"maybe die" bad?

04:03.790 --> 04:05.330
Rabies means death,

04:05.330 --> 04:08.250
unless quickly treated
with a series of extremely
painful shots.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.880
Works for me! (LAUGHS)

04:14.710 --> 04:16.380
Why do we have to
hike all the way up a mountain

04:16.380 --> 04:18.420
to see a lake
full of broken bottles?

04:18.420 --> 04:20.250
Because Landfill Magazine
called Glass Lake

04:20.250 --> 04:23.210
one of five best
non-medical waste sites
in Maine.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.210
Ooh, look! A ski lift!

04:26.210 --> 04:28.250
Let's take that
up the mountain!

04:28.250 --> 04:29.790
Too bad it is closed
for the summer.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.210
I can get it started.

04:31.210 --> 04:32.880
I have the key.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.500
Guys, absolutely not.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.210
It's illegal.
It's dangerous.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.120
And it's terrifying.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.250
Who's scared of heights?

04:42.250 --> 04:43.460
That guy!

04:43.460 --> 04:44.710
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:44.710 --> 04:47.500
I'm not afraid of heights!

04:47.500 --> 04:49.170
I'm afraid of falling
from them.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.330
Oh...

04:52.330 --> 04:55.750
So instead of suffering
from acrophobia,
fear of heights,

04:55.750 --> 04:56.920
you suffer from FOF,

04:56.920 --> 04:58.210
fear of falling.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.500
Which is actually more common
in women and small children.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.250
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

05:02.250 --> 05:04.420
Hey, what's it called
when you have a fear
of the next time Ravi speaks?

05:04.420 --> 05:06.790
Because I have that.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.000
Technically, that would be
more of a dread than a fear.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.710
(SIGHS)

05:11.710 --> 05:15.080
You know, you're lucky
you know how to work that
GPS thing-a-ma-jig.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.290
All right, Xander,
we don't have to ride
the ski lift,

05:18.290 --> 05:21.210
but can we just
get a picture of the four
of us sitting on it?

05:21.210 --> 05:23.040
I guess that wouldn't be
too scary.

05:24.580 --> 05:26.120
I can't believe
I fell for that.

05:31.120 --> 05:35.080
Okay, campers,
to decorate for tomorrow's
Camp Kikiwaka Games,

05:35.080 --> 05:37.290
we're using items
found in the forest.

05:37.290 --> 05:39.670
Can I be excused?
Is something wrong?

05:39.670 --> 05:42.960
Yeah, I don't want to be here.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.790
Zuri, show your sister
some respect,
and don't interrupt.

05:46.790 --> 05:47.920
(SIGHS)

05:47.920 --> 05:49.210
Oh, thanks, Mom.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.380
Now, I like to start
by using pinecones and...

05:51.380 --> 05:54.290
(GASPS) Sweetie!
An Eastern White pinecone?

05:54.290 --> 05:57.170
I'd consider opting
for a loblolly.

05:57.170 --> 05:59.170
I tried to tell her, Mommy.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.120
Well, a pinecone
is a pinecone.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.330
Actually, loblollies
have a more dramatic shape.

06:07.330 --> 06:11.500
Plus, the aroma
is delicately evergreen,
and not crudely earthen.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.790
A White, bad.
Loblolly, good.

06:17.710 --> 06:21.000
Well, I just gave
those Rottweilers a bone.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.170
Too bad it was mine.

06:23.790 --> 06:26.960
Dang!
You got messed up!

06:26.960 --> 06:31.170
Zuri, have some respect
for the owner of the camp.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.460
Sorry, Gladys.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.580
Oh, actually
her name isn't Gladys.

06:34.580 --> 06:37.500
I checked,
and the first runner-up
for Counselor of the Year

06:37.500 --> 06:40.380
was always Chai Son Wutipong.

06:40.380 --> 06:43.420
Nice to see you again,
Chai Son.

06:43.420 --> 06:46.920
Okay, I may have been
second runner-up.
Or last.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.670
I can't remember,
I've lost a lot of blood.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.670
(SOBS)

06:54.290 --> 06:56.880
Okay, time to glue on
our loblollies.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.880
Ooh, sweetie,
is that the glue
you're going to use?

06:59.880 --> 07:01.170
(INHALES SHARPLY)

07:02.000 --> 07:03.080
I guess not.

07:04.170 --> 07:06.000
Oh, thank goodness.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.580
Because obviously
you'll get a better hold
with hot glue.

07:09.580 --> 07:10.670
Here, can I show you?

07:12.330 --> 07:13.960
A demonstration from a legend!

07:14.540 --> 07:15.710
I'm not worthy.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.120
Okay, setting up a tent
can be tricky.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.380
Done! Yes!

07:21.380 --> 07:23.170
(APPLAUDING)

07:23.170 --> 07:25.040
She just broke
her own camp record!

07:25.040 --> 07:27.250
Is there anything
this woman can't do?

07:28.330 --> 07:30.330
Apparently not.

07:30.330 --> 07:33.210
Mom, I'm having
a hard time with my tent.

07:33.210 --> 07:34.620
I can give you
some pointers.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.120
I don't want any pointers.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.290
I want my mom
to pitch my tent,
while I go get a shaved ice.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.250
Oh, honey,
I'd be happy to help.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.040
Thanks, Mommy.

07:47.540 --> 07:49.210
You're leaving, too?

07:49.210 --> 07:50.170
Might as well.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.210
Now that super-counselor Mom
is here,

07:52.210 --> 07:53.120
there's nothing for me to do.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.040
Me either!
Isn't it great?

08:00.210 --> 08:03.330
Guys, this is awesome!

08:03.330 --> 08:08.170
I'm not even sweating,
and we're 5,000 feet
up the mountain!

08:08.170 --> 08:09.250
Oh, geez!

08:11.000 --> 08:12.620
Xander, calm down,

08:12.620 --> 08:15.750
this way we're going to get
to your stupid Glass Lake
twice as fast.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.460
Exactly.

08:17.460 --> 08:20.040
We just cleared the treetops
and are now heading over
Dead Man's Ravine.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.750
Mommy!

08:25.250 --> 08:26.620
Relax, Xander.

08:26.620 --> 08:30.290
I will use my extensive
psychological skill set
to keep you calm.

08:30.290 --> 08:31.170
All will be well.

08:34.710 --> 08:36.290
The lift is stuck!

08:36.290 --> 08:37.460
We are going to die!

08:37.460 --> 08:38.460
(SCREAMS)

08:42.000 --> 08:43.120
Hey, Emma!

08:43.120 --> 08:45.170
Thanks
for taking us all fishing.

08:45.170 --> 08:47.580
Those memories
will last a lifetime.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.080
Oh, cut the junk.
I know you weren't there.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.830
What?

08:52.120 --> 08:53.120
Emma...

08:55.460 --> 08:57.170
I don't care.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.080
The minute we got to the lake,
the fishing trip stopped
being my thing,

08:59.080 --> 09:00.710
and became Mom's.

09:00.710 --> 09:03.000
All right,
let's set these down here,

09:03.000 --> 09:07.960
then I'll hop in the forklift
and grab the rest of the fish
I caught.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.380
She's even a licensed
forklift operator!

09:12.880 --> 09:14.210
Hey, Em.

09:14.210 --> 09:16.210
I thought you'd like to keep
the fish you caught.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.120
Thanks, Mom.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.170
Just remember,
put it in a nice bowl.

09:20.170 --> 09:22.330
Right.
And change the water weekly.

09:22.330 --> 09:24.460
Got it.
And don't overfeed it.

09:24.460 --> 09:25.620
I won't!

09:25.620 --> 09:26.750
Anything else?

09:27.620 --> 09:28.620
I'll make you a list.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.670
Of course you will.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.960
Sorry, Emma.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.120
I know what it's like to have
an overbearing mom.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.290
I really think you need
to level with her.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.040
Just be honest,
and tell her how you feel.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.500
Huh, that sounds
like good advice.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.210
Did things change
when you talked to your mom?

09:49.210 --> 09:50.210
Are you crazy?

09:50.210 --> 09:51.920
I don't talk back
to my mother!

09:53.460 --> 09:55.250
I don't even
look her in the eye!

09:55.880 --> 09:56.880
Good luck.

10:00.710 --> 10:03.830
Oh, darn, would you
look at the time!

10:03.830 --> 10:06.540
Mom, it looks like
it's time for you to go
back to the yacht.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.290
CHRISTINA AND LOU: Already?

10:08.290 --> 10:09.750
No, not yet!

10:09.750 --> 10:12.290
I'm still confused
about doing laundry.

10:12.290 --> 10:14.040
Maybe you could help me,
Mommy.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.500
Zuri, it's easy, just...
Zip it, Tiff.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.620
Besides,
the Camp Games are tomorrow.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.330
They are?
I loved the Camp Games!

10:24.330 --> 10:27.250
It would be an honor to have
a six-time champion there.

10:27.250 --> 10:31.040
Actually, seven times,
but who's counting?

10:31.710 --> 10:34.170
Obviously, someone is.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.330
Hey, Christina,
how about you
spend the night with us?

10:36.330 --> 10:39.380
Oh, as fun as that would be,
sadly, there's nowhere
for her to sleep.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.330
Em, you and I
could be bunk buddies!

10:41.330 --> 10:42.920
Absolutely not.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.170
Emma will sleep on the floor!

10:46.120 --> 10:48.210
This is going to be
so much fun!

10:57.920 --> 11:00.170
There. Snug as a bug in a rug.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.790
Emma, are you sure
you don't want to sleep
up here with me?

11:05.790 --> 11:08.420
Oh, no, a camp legend
deserves her own bed.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.250
And extra pillows.
Here!

11:11.880 --> 11:13.000
Ow!

11:14.250 --> 11:15.250
Take Emma's.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.290
I can't believe you guys
are going to sleep already.

11:21.290 --> 11:23.790
You know what I used to do
for fun with my campers?

11:23.790 --> 11:25.120
Fold their laundry?

11:26.830 --> 11:29.830
Surprise water balloon fight!

11:31.250 --> 11:32.250
(GASPS)

11:34.920 --> 11:36.540
Oh, this is fun!

11:36.540 --> 11:38.670
This is so fun!

11:39.290 --> 11:41.420
Mom, can we talk?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.330
Outside.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.750
Sure, sweetie.
But it's chilly outside

11:45.750 --> 11:47.670
and you are soaking wet.
So you should grab a sweater.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.250
Oh, not that one.

11:54.170 --> 11:55.170
Yeah.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.250
You tell her, Emma.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.080
A flashcard
is not a birthday card.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.420
Oh, wait, that's my mom,
not yours.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.120
(GASPS)

12:05.750 --> 12:07.040
Zuri!

12:07.040 --> 12:09.710
Come on! You had to know
I was going to do that.

12:09.710 --> 12:10.710
(SIGHS)

12:12.290 --> 12:14.830
But I bet you didn't know
I was going to do that.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.330
Honey, what's wrong?
Well...

12:20.330 --> 12:22.710
Is it your fish?
'Cause I noticed you haven't
changed the water yet.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.250
It's not about the fish!

12:27.250 --> 12:29.170
Okay, this is hard to say,
but...

12:29.170 --> 12:30.120
Ooh...

12:30.120 --> 12:31.920
I think I know
what's going on.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.210
You do?
Yeah.

12:34.210 --> 12:37.790
You're a little jealous,
because Lou and I
are becoming friends.

12:37.790 --> 12:42.080
But that's silly,
'cause you'll always
be my best girl.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.040
Who's up for a game
of Kikiwopoly?

12:44.040 --> 12:45.880
Oh! I get to be the canoe!

12:46.790 --> 12:48.330
Mom!

12:48.330 --> 12:50.250
Oh, sorry, sweetie.
You can be the canoe.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.710
Right after you change
that poor fish's water.

13:00.330 --> 13:01.330
(SNORING)

13:05.210 --> 13:07.000
(SCREAMS)

13:08.540 --> 13:09.670
(SCREAMS)

13:10.290 --> 13:11.290
Help!

13:12.290 --> 13:14.290
I can help...

13:14.290 --> 13:16.960
Myself get promoted
to counselor.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.540
No!

13:19.120 --> 13:20.330
(GASPING)

13:20.330 --> 13:21.500
Whoa! Whoa!
Xander, are you okay?

13:21.500 --> 13:22.670
Back off, man!

13:22.670 --> 13:24.330
And just so you know,

13:24.330 --> 13:26.250
if I die,
that doesn't automatically
make you counselor.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.670
Hmm, paranoia.

13:29.670 --> 13:31.170
Fascinating.

13:32.250 --> 13:36.000
Guys, you woke me up.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.500
And I was having
the best dream ever.

13:42.210 --> 13:43.790
Well, what was it?

13:45.210 --> 13:47.830
Must we tell each other
everything?

13:50.210 --> 13:52.880
I can't believe
we're going to miss
the Kikiwaka Games.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.880
I cannot believe
how thirsty I am.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.920
You could drink
Xander's tears.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.330
He's got plenty of those.

13:59.330 --> 14:02.120
But the salt
would just dehydrate
me more...

14:02.120 --> 14:03.710
Stop talking!

14:03.710 --> 14:06.080
We need to figure out a way
to get off this thing!

14:06.080 --> 14:09.120
Hey, maybe we could
make a rope out of our clothes

14:09.120 --> 14:11.460
and use that to climb
to that treetop.

14:11.460 --> 14:14.040
But all of our clothes
are in our packs,
at the base of the mountain.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.330
I was talking about
what we're wearing.

14:16.330 --> 14:17.380
I'm in.

14:17.380 --> 14:19.290
Come on, guys, clothes off.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.580
Help me.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.540
This just got more terrifying.

14:27.380 --> 14:30.330
Ugh, I am so tired.

14:30.330 --> 14:33.120
Why are you tired?
I'm the one who slept
on the floor.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.710
Because I was up all night
laughing at you.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.670
I'm having
the worst morning ever.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.540
You think you've had
a bad morning?

14:43.170 --> 14:45.080
Dang!
You got owned again!

14:46.420 --> 14:48.170
What happened to you
this time?

14:48.170 --> 14:50.750
I was just snorkeling up
to a certain yacht,

14:50.750 --> 14:53.210
when a vicious dolphin
attacked me!

14:53.210 --> 14:55.540
Oh, that's our guard dolphin,
Shredder.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.210
He came with the dogs.

14:58.210 --> 15:00.670
He did? Where do you
rich people shop?

15:02.040 --> 15:03.290
Hear ye!
Hear ye!

15:03.290 --> 15:07.120
Make way
for the Camp Kikiwaka Games
seven-time champion,

15:07.120 --> 15:08.750
Christina Ross!

15:08.750 --> 15:10.000
Ooh! Aah!

15:10.000 --> 15:11.580
(APPLAUDING)

15:11.580 --> 15:15.080
Oh, what's next?
Is Lou going to scatter
rose petals in her path?

15:17.750 --> 15:21.080
Hey, Em! You wanna
be partners for
the Kikiwaka Games?

15:21.080 --> 15:23.960
Oh, thanks, Mom,
but, actually
I'm gonna partner with...

15:25.290 --> 15:26.290
Gladys.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.250
BOTH: Gladys?

15:30.250 --> 15:33.250
Did someone say my name?
I can't hear too well.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.710
My ears are filled with
seawater and blood.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.210
Uh, Gladys, will you
be my partner for the games?

15:40.210 --> 15:42.620
Really? Me? Why?

15:42.620 --> 15:45.960
Because you want
to beat my mom
as much as I do.

15:45.960 --> 15:49.210
Come on, let's team up
and destroy her.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.920
Welcome to
the dark side, kid.
(CHUCKLES)

15:58.330 --> 16:00.880
All right, Zuri,
the first event
is the three-legged race.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.250
I have a strategy
that will guarantee
we take first place.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.880
I don't want to come in first.
Why not?

16:06.880 --> 16:11.920
Because my mom loves to win,
and I have an allowance
to protect.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.920
Christina?

16:15.920 --> 16:18.790
Would you make me
the happiest counselor
in the world

16:18.790 --> 16:21.120
and be my partner
for the Kikiwaka Games?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.710
I'd be happy to.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.710
(CHUCKLES) She said yes!

16:26.250 --> 16:27.170
Now focus.

16:27.170 --> 16:28.960
We need to annihilate my mom!

16:28.960 --> 16:31.170
What's your beef
with your mom anyway?

16:31.170 --> 16:34.500
I mean, I have many reasons
to hate her. Like, one,

16:34.500 --> 16:36.580
she stole Morgan from me.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.290
Two, she beat me out for
Counselor of the Year...

16:40.120 --> 16:41.580
Ninety-nine,

16:41.580 --> 16:44.170
those freakishly
flab-less arms.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.620
And 100...

16:45.620 --> 16:47.460
I get it! You don't
like the woman!

16:50.290 --> 16:51.750
Okay, done.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.830
Wait, I must check the rope.

16:53.830 --> 16:56.790
Since poor Xander
is incapacitated by his fear,

16:56.790 --> 16:59.500
I, as a CIT,
am responsible
for your safety.

17:01.170 --> 17:04.120
Ugh, Jorge, why are
your shorts all sweaty?

17:04.120 --> 17:05.750
(CHUCKLES)
That's not sweat.

17:05.750 --> 17:06.830
Ew!

17:07.290 --> 17:08.790
BOTH: Ravi!

17:08.790 --> 17:11.710
That was our one chance
to keep from dying up here!

17:11.710 --> 17:13.290
I still say I made
the right decision.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.500
Good luck out there, Em.
You too, Chai Son.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.250
Oh, that knot's
all wrong.

17:24.250 --> 17:27.380
You should use
the Stevedore's knot.
Pay attention Chai Son.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.250
There. All set.

17:34.330 --> 17:37.710
We need to beat my mom,
and beat her bad.

17:37.710 --> 17:40.040
Which is why I brought
this crowbar.

17:41.330 --> 17:44.120
What? No! I meant
beat her in the race!

17:44.120 --> 17:45.790
I don't want to injure my mom.

17:45.790 --> 17:49.330
Oh, I was joking.
Obviously joking.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

17:53.210 --> 17:54.290
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

17:54.290 --> 17:55.920
(ALL CHEERING)

17:57.790 --> 18:00.620
Come on, Gladys!
Run like my dad
is at the finish line!

18:00.620 --> 18:03.210
We'll never win
unless we do this.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.040
(GRUNTS)

18:09.330 --> 18:10.540
Now's our chance! Run!

18:12.330 --> 18:15.120
I'm going to win!
Victory's finally mine!

18:15.120 --> 18:16.880
Ours! You mean, ours!

18:23.330 --> 18:26.250
(GRUNTS) Come on, Zuri,
we can win this!

18:26.250 --> 18:28.790
No, we can't!
Allowance at stake!

18:37.670 --> 18:39.250
(BOTH GRUNTING AND LAUGHING)

18:39.250 --> 18:43.120
I'm on my way to becoming
an eight-time champion!

18:43.120 --> 18:44.420
Not that
I'm counting.

18:45.210 --> 18:48.080
Yes, you are counting!

18:48.080 --> 18:50.830
We get it. You're
the greatest counselor
who ever lived!

18:51.170 --> 18:52.170
Emma?

18:53.750 --> 18:56.120
Why are you so upset?
Is something wrong?

18:56.120 --> 18:59.250
Yes, but you're so
wrapped up in yourself,

18:59.250 --> 19:00.830
you didn't even notice!

19:00.830 --> 19:03.170
I was so happy
when you first got here,

19:03.170 --> 19:05.750
but now I wish
you'd never come!

19:05.750 --> 19:09.960
Ditto! Except for the part
about being happy
when you first got here!

19:15.460 --> 19:18.380
So...

19:18.380 --> 19:19.880
Anyone want
to play "I spy"?

19:21.290 --> 19:22.830
(ALL SCREAMING)

19:24.040 --> 19:25.210
We're gonna die!

19:25.210 --> 19:26.670
In our underwear!

19:26.670 --> 19:27.920
(ALL SCREAMING)

19:29.460 --> 19:31.250
What are we going to do?

19:31.250 --> 19:33.290
Hey. Maybe
I can grab the cable

19:33.290 --> 19:35.210
and make my way
back to the tower.

19:35.210 --> 19:37.250
No! That's
way too dangerous!

19:37.250 --> 19:39.380
I've shimmied down
plenty of rain pipes.

19:39.380 --> 19:41.960
Since I'm not carrying
a plasma TV,
this should be easy!

19:42.460 --> 19:45.170
No... I'll go.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.620
Xander, I have to stop you.

19:49.620 --> 19:53.460
No, Ravi. I'm the counselor.
It's my responsibility
to do this.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.210
I meant, I have to stop you

19:55.210 --> 19:57.040
because you are heading
the wrong way.
The tower is that way.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.040
(SCREAMS)

20:02.170 --> 20:05.580
(SCREAMING)
We're moving!

20:05.580 --> 20:09.040
We're going to be okay!
Maybe you are! Help!

20:09.620 --> 20:10.920
(GRUNTING)

20:14.080 --> 20:15.290
(PANTING)

20:15.290 --> 20:18.290
See, taking the ski lift
was a great idea.

20:19.420 --> 20:21.170
(ALL SCREAMING)

20:24.710 --> 20:28.210
Gladys, if you don't mind,
I'd rather be alone.

20:28.210 --> 20:31.080
Me too, but I can't untie
this dang knot!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.120
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

20:36.210 --> 20:38.170
Em, can we talk?

20:38.170 --> 20:40.040
Could you give us
a minute, Chai Son?

20:41.380 --> 20:44.620
It's Gladys! And this knot
is impossible!

20:47.210 --> 20:48.830
It's just a simple
Stevedore's knot.

20:50.210 --> 20:51.670
I hate you.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.120
Emma, I am so sorry.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.420
I had no idea
you were so upset with me.

21:02.330 --> 21:03.580
I tried to tell you.

21:03.580 --> 21:05.920
Yeah, and I should
have listened.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.120
I just think I got
caught up reliving
my glory days.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.670
Well, your glory days
were pretty glorious.

21:12.670 --> 21:16.500
But this is your time now.
And I should have
realized that.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.120
I'll never be the great
Christina Ross.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.330
You don't have to be.

21:23.330 --> 21:26.250
You're already
the great Emma Ross,

21:26.250 --> 21:28.880
and I am so incredibly
proud of you.

21:30.330 --> 21:33.080
Really?
Absolutely.

21:34.790 --> 21:39.420
Camp Kikiwaka
is lucky to have you,
and so am I.

21:40.790 --> 21:41.880
Thanks, Mom.

21:43.330 --> 21:45.710
And I'm really happy
you came to visit.

21:45.710 --> 21:49.040
Everybody loved
having you here.
Except Gladys.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.120
Who?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.580
Mommy?

21:56.580 --> 21:59.830
Before you go, can you
help me make this lanyard?

21:59.830 --> 22:03.540
I'll just be over there,
watching and learning
from the hammock.

22:03.540 --> 22:08.620
Sorry, sweetie, but Emma
pointed out that I have a
little tendency to take over.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.330
So, you're just gonna need
to finish that yourself.

22:13.210 --> 22:15.960
Thanks a lot, Emma!
You broke Mom!

22:17.830 --> 22:19.710
Wha... Mrs. Mommy!

22:19.710 --> 22:22.120
(GASPS) Ravi!

22:23.420 --> 22:25.040
Where are your clothes?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.580
On top of a tree.
Hmm?

22:26.580 --> 22:29.210
It is a long story.

22:29.210 --> 22:32.170
I am so sorry to have
missed your entire visit!

22:32.170 --> 22:33.750
Aw. That's okay, sweetie.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.620
We can just catch up
this winter on
the family ski trip.

22:36.620 --> 22:37.920
(SCREAMS) No!

22:39.580 --> 22:41.830
I just love
my odd little boy.

22:43.170 --> 22:45.120
Christina, it was
a pleasure meeting you.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.000
But before you go, could
I get a picture with you?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.040
Sure.

22:50.380 --> 22:53.500
Wow, Lou. This is
the most normal you've been
since my mom arrived.

22:53.500 --> 22:57.040
Thanks! That's gonna
look awesome tattooed
across my back!

22:59.120 --> 23:00.460
And there's the crazy.
