You've both met bad men before.
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.925
MOSLEY: Michael Gray.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.044
You lost all your cousin's money
in America playing the fool.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.121
And poor old Arthur Shelby
is afraid his wife will never return.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.442
There's a bullet,
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.009
It's war you want,

00:29.120 --> 00:30.963
it's war you shall have.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.683
I've been talking to the Friends.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.484
One of the Friends is a man.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.080
He would die without his eyes.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.885
These hands belong to the devil!

00:40.000 --> 00:42.731
By the time
that baby draws its first breath,

00:42.840 --> 00:44.080
you and I will be done.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.406

02:37.280 --> 02:38.964
I was looking forward to killing you.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.251
You're at the back of a long queue.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.927
My white flag is a flag of truce.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.048
Yours is more a flag of surrender.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.491
Whatever you say, Mr McCavern,
the colour is the same.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.761
The outcome is the same.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.122
I believe we've friends in common.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.685
We should postpone our war.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.201
Your brother left me a hand grenade.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.651
He sends his apologies.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.728
You left me land mines.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.650
For which I too apologise.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.682
Then peace it is.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.168
Your message said you wanted
to seal our truce with some business.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.002
Since we're men of similar interests
and distribution networks,

03:21.120 --> 03:23.691
I thought we might use
our temporary settlement

03:23.800 --> 03:25.802
for our mutual benefit.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.890
You stand in a yard full of scrap metal
and stolen goods,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.445
and you talk like a politician.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.962
No, nothing here is stolen, Mr McCavern.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.481
Charlie simply finds things
before they're lost.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.203
The nature of the deal
is explained in my proposal.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.927
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.169
If you need anything in this city,
just mention my name.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.163
So you want to impress me, Mr Shelby?

03:53.440 --> 03:54.771
Isiah.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.642
Also in the envelope is a cheque
for £500.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.481
For your wife.
She can use it to buy a black dress,

04:06.600 --> 04:09.444
rent a black horse with black feathers

04:09.560 --> 04:12.564
to pull a black carriage
with your body in it,

04:12.680 --> 04:15.570
should you break the terms
of the white flag.

This week I've managed
to get to the people

04:46.720 --> 04:49.690
at York and Lincoln City.
I mean, they're the teams that are losing.

04:49.800 --> 04:50.801
I got to them.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.248
Right, go on. Go on, take your time.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.361
Mm.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.565
I got to the goalkeepers,
they all said £5 is enough.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.681
I, erm...

05:03.640 --> 05:06.928
I've written to the people
at Tranmere Rovers

05:07.040 --> 05:09.771
because the phone you put
into my...into my house stopped working.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.609
So I'm gonna need
another one of those.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.881
OK.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.210
Once we've got that fixed,
hey, then we'll have all the names

05:17.320 --> 05:21.962
and numbers
of the First Division referees.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.127

05:29.480 --> 05:32.245
Listen, listen to me. Come on now.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.010
No need for that. Hm?

05:34.120 --> 05:35.281
Yeah.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.926
We need you to find out
what they like.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.088
You know, what gets them going.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.568
Cos a lot of them are comfortable.
A fiver's nothing to them.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.921
We need you to find out
what they really like playing.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.246
Yes.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.442
See, cos we can offer them that.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.164
Oh, yeah. Shelby Company Limited,

05:52.280 --> 05:56.330
we can offer them
all the lovely things people like.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.521
Hm?

05:58.560 --> 06:03.851
We can also offer 'em protection
from the things they don't like.

THOMAS: It's all right, Mrs Connors.
You can carry on. It's just my brother.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.206
So tell me how it happened?

06:59.320 --> 07:01.448
MRS CONNORS:
They were sleeping downstairs.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.162
And then my husband came home...

07:05.280 --> 07:08.170
...drunk from the Marquis,
even though he just lost his job.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.611
We don't have any money.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.807
Anyway, he came to bed.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.888
But downstairs,
they must have heard a noise.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.047
They woke up.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.003
They started, er, calling out.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.844
They woke my husband up, and...

07:24.160 --> 07:26.288
...when he's drunk, you don't wake him up.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.921
What happened then, Mrs Connors?

07:31.640 --> 07:33.051
He, erm...

07:33.160 --> 07:34.889
He...

07:35.000 --> 07:36.411
He went downstairs.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.961
He killed them.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.564
Strangled them. All three of them.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.125
(SIGHS)

07:46.240 --> 07:52.885
And you've, erm... You've...you've brought
their bodies here today with you.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.048
Proof, Mr Shelby.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.166
(CHUCKLES)

08:08.280 --> 08:12.001

in my life.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.565
I don't care my husband beats me...

08:18.040 --> 08:19.530
...but not this.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.166
Mrs Connors.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.361
We have your address.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.847
We will speak to your husband.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.769
My brother here

08:29.880 --> 08:31.928
will go to the Bull Ring market today,

08:32.039 --> 08:34.486
and buy you three new goldfinches,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.682
and have them delivered
to your door.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.246
The same colours
and, you know, feathers.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.445
The new ones I will call
Thomas, Arthur and Finn.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.489
That'll make him pause,

08:46.600 --> 08:48.329
even when he's drunk.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.811
Good day, Mr Shelby.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.411
You take care, Mrs Connors.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.646
Bye.

I don't know how you do this, Tom.
I really don't!

09:02.640 --> 09:04.768
You learn things, Arthur.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.729
That woman
has only two rooms downstairs.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.561
Her husband has lost his job
and he beats her.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.047
And yet, the thing that brings her

09:16.160 --> 09:20.006
to see her Member of Parliament
is songbirds.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.962
Now, that's politics, Arthur.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.809
It's not for me.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.001
Anyway, look.

on the football?

09:30.520 --> 09:33.967
Ten grand this week.
Finn showing promise, Tom.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.764
Maybe we should put him
on the tracks.

- Bring her in.

- No. He's Chinese.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.930
...you die.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.485
If you die here today,
we'll bury you face down with no hands.

- I don't care about rituals.

A foreman at the dock estimated there was
seven tonnes of the stuff.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.244
I made a note at the time.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.724
I spoke to that particular foreman

15:32.840 --> 15:35.081
and I worked out that

15:35.200 --> 15:39.000
seven tonnes of pure opium crystals
would be worth...

16:17.440 --> 16:18.487
But your trousers are dry.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.761
You didn't piss yourself.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.928
- He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
- Well done, Finn.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.487
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.206
And Arthur here tells me
we should put you on the tracks.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.368
Gonna be a good day for you after all,
Finn.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.766
Give me that!

16:31.880 --> 16:33.041
Hey!

16:33.160 --> 16:36.721
Always have your whores
searched at the door.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.161

I'll fucking cut her.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.369
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.407
A gesture of goodwill.

17:04.359 --> 17:05.646
I'll throw it in the canal.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.887
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?

17:38.760 --> 17:41.684
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.167
ARTHUR: What fucking deal?

17:44.280 --> 17:47.568
How does it feel
to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

17:47.680 --> 17:50.809
It makes me feel young.
What fucking deal?

17:50.920 --> 17:52.001
Four boats.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.043
Four days.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.561
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.

17:56.680 --> 18:01.322
Half the cargo is coal
and underneath the coal,

18:01.440 --> 18:02.805
pure opium crystal.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.002
Opium.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.281
I vote against it.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.811
They can't use trucks

18:08.920 --> 18:11.491
because the Chinese drivers
get stopped by the police.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.840
They need to get it out of London

18:12.960 --> 18:15.440
because all the warehouses
are being searched by Customs.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.882
The seven tonnes
is bound for San Francisco,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.970
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days from Liverpool.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.650
They need somewhere safe to store it.

18:23.760 --> 18:27.731
All we have to do is take it up the canal
and keep it here for a week.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.322
We don't fuck with the Chinese, though,
Tom. Dad always said it.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.081
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

18:35.200 --> 18:37.521
to drive four boats up the canal

18:37.640 --> 18:39.563
with no prospect of inspection?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.287
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.368
- Mm-mm.
- Polly?

18:45.480 --> 18:48.006
£250,000.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.727
That's half of what Michael lost
in Chicago.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.889
I will ask him to take charge
of this business.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.571
Michael's position will be reinstated
in the company?

18:57.680 --> 19:00.490
His period of quarantine would be over.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.326
Think about it, brother.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.841
Four boats sailing up the cut,

19:09.960 --> 19:12.327
smelling of wood smoke and bacon.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.607
And which one
of Charlie's Gypsy didicoy friends

19:16.720 --> 19:21.248
do you trust, Tom, eh,
with a cargo worth £1 million?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.601
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.721
Let's vote.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.561
Those in favour.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.925
(ARTHUR GRUNTS)

19:38.120 --> 19:42.603
Motion carried.
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats

19:42.720 --> 19:45.371
and four tonnes of coal
before it gets dark.

19:45.480 --> 19:46.925
They sail south tonight.

19:48.440 --> 19:52.923
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.201
Yes, Tommy.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.480
Fuck!

20:11.280 --> 20:12.645
What have you heard, Pol?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.167
The man you cut went to the police...

20:19.040 --> 20:20.405
...but we dealt with it.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.807
Is she with him?

20:26.440 --> 20:29.489
If she was, it would be your fault,
Arthur.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.286
But they say his face is so badly cut
he's hard to look at.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.767
So I would say not.

20:35.880 --> 20:42.126
I would also say
it is time to give up on Linda,

20:42.240 --> 20:47.929
find someone else
who might be able to put your fires out.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.724
I can't, though, Pol.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.050
I fucking can't!

21:09.640 --> 21:11.210
And that's it.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.721

21:29.080 --> 21:30.684
Whiskey?

21:30.800 --> 21:32.040
Thank you, no.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.887
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep jimmy McCavern alive.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.924
I've already got a time and a place
for the killing.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.167
You see?

21:53.560 --> 21:56.962
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.323
A girl called Karen who hates him,
who will give him up.

22:00.440 --> 22:05.207
I have the sound of cranes and winches
to cover the gunshot.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.926
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.883
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.288
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.244
When that business is done,
he's all yours.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.843
You can avenge the death of your son
in any way you see fit.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.962

22:29.240 --> 22:30.241
Yeah.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.363
And then you will marry
and you will settle.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.721
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

22:38.240 --> 22:40.368
Just let me understand you.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.563
Do you mean
that Polly is part of this deal?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.609
Yeah.

22:50.640 --> 22:54.122
Well, Holy Lord God,
Tommy Shelby OBE,

22:54.240 --> 22:56.561
does your vanity have no limits?

22:56.680 --> 22:58.842
I believe it is called the ego these days.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.166
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)
I read books.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.807
You sit on your throne
and you instruct Polly Gray,

23:03.920 --> 23:05.524
who is of far richer blood than you,

23:05.640 --> 23:08.450
as to when she can
and when she can't marry.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.847
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.008
She has her own strategies.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.531
And we are of the same blood.

23:14.640 --> 23:19.407
She will marry you, but only if you agree
to postpone any attack on McCavern

23:19.520 --> 23:21.124
<i>until this business is done.</i>

23:21.240 --> 23:25.723

that's yours to give away.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.686

when she's barefoot on the cobbles.

What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's gonna be done in the old way,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.288
well, you know, you throw in
a few coloured ponies or...

23:36.400 --> 23:38.482
I'm having an event at my house.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.125
You are invited.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.163
Polly will be there.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.727
There will be candles and violins

23:45.840 --> 23:47.171
and dancing.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.523
Polly wants you to propose
in the proper way,

23:50.640 --> 23:52.961
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.448
Inviting you for this purpose
was Polly's idea.

- I don't read.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.809
- It's <i>Swan Lake.</i>
<i>- Ballet?</i>

24:07.920 --> 24:09.126
Yeah.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.368
Apparently, it's about love.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.642

24:13.760 --> 24:15.728

I did some research into her.

as a younger man in Birmingham,

I came across her.

to nightclubs in the south of town.

maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

33:24.280 --> 33:26.965
There's nothing in his books
of any use to a man like me.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.366
They talk about guilt.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.845
Eh?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.883
Guilt! What fucking guilt?

33:32.000 --> 33:34.685
- The black barge.
- No. No, that's not it.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.689
That's not it. He had it right.

33:36.800 --> 33:40.930
Mosley had it right.
He said, "Forbidding is forbidden to us.

33:41.040 --> 33:44.487
"We can do anything.
Nothing can stop us."

33:44.600 --> 33:47.285
But there's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.050
And I keep finding myself there.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.964
And only thejanua/ycan get me away.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.728
Will you at least try
the doctors again, Tom?

34:05.600 --> 34:07.602
Well, then at least throw away your opium.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.245
It's that that causes the visions.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.010
Just...throw it away.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.929
While it's there, it's a temptation.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.485
- (SIGHS)
- How much have you got left?

34:16.719 --> 34:18.051
Seven tonnes.

34:18.159 --> 34:21.402
- Seven tonnes?
- Yeah.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.563
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.005
(SCOFFS)

34:40.360 --> 34:41.521
You do me a favour?

34:44.760 --> 34:49.243
When that kid of yours arrives,
keep it away from me.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.884
A fucking ballet.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.731
He wants to impress someone.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.490
And I'm invited?

35:11.600 --> 35:12.806
You and Gina.

35:14.640 --> 35:15.641
Why?

35:17.440 --> 35:20.728
Because he wants to give you
the chance to come back properly.

35:32.440 --> 35:33.521
Coal haulage?

35:33.640 --> 35:34.880
Yeah.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.050
Tommy wants you to reopen those books
and become managing director.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.607
So I've come back from Detroit
to become a coal man?

35:45.160 --> 35:48.607
The first delivery
is bound for San Francisco,

35:48.720 --> 35:50.165
but if it works...

35:51.240 --> 35:53.925
...T0mmy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.170
And this, erm, this coal...

36:00.360 --> 36:02.249
- ...is it snow white?
- No.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.885
Golden brown.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.561
Fuck.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.047
This is your opportunity, Michael.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.482
There is more money in this
than there is

36:17.600 --> 36:21.685
in all the other parts of our business
put together.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.168
Tommy knows
what opium does to people.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.760
Tommy knows
what whiskey does to people.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.962
He got an OBE for selling it.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.045
I'll speak to Gina.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.930
(SCOFFS) You'll what?

36:50.040 --> 36:52.520
I will consult my wife.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.846
Your father ran this business
for a bit.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.769
1901.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.644
And he shipped coal. Real coal.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.410
Just coal.

37:02.520 --> 37:08.766
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.486
And the merchants would offer them
one price

37:11.600 --> 37:13.443
and then only pay half

37:13.560 --> 37:15.369
because they could.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.131
And thatwas wrong, Michael.

37:41.800 --> 37:46.283
Run your hands through it,
get it under your skin...

37:47.920 --> 37:51.402
...and then see if Gina will let you
lay a finger on her.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.485
(COAL CLATTERS)

37:59.280 --> 38:03.365
I think golden brown
is more to her taste.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.723
Especially when you tell her
how much money you're going to earn.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.843
(DOOR OPENS)

38:19.800 --> 38:21.245
(DOOR CLOSES)

38:30.560 --> 38:32.961
Now we're in business together,
I should ask,

38:33.080 --> 38:36.209
which foot do you kick the ball with,
Mr Shelby?

38:36.320 --> 38:37.481
I have no religion.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.245
Some nights I wish I had.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.481
He's kin?

38:43.640 --> 38:44.641
Yeah.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.406
And the simple fellow?

38:48.680 --> 38:51.160
He's a lot less simple
than you might at first think.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.127
Do you trust them?

39:00.440 --> 39:02.169
Right. So I take a boatload.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.606
No.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.441
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.642
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.331
Cash payment on loading.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.601
£10,000.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.441
For that amount,
it'll have to be a cheque.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.766
I don't take cheques.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.725
It'll be a cheque.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.521
I will take a cheque

39:29.640 --> 39:31.881
if it's guaranteed
by our mutual friend in London,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.001
Mr Mosley.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.964
(CHUCKLES)

39:46.080 --> 39:48.401
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business

39:48.520 --> 39:51.410
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

39:53.760 --> 39:57.003
Yeah, who'd have thought,
eh, Charlie?

39:57.120 --> 39:58.610
CHARLIE: Who would have thought it?

39:58.720 --> 40:01.041
Aye, but you're OK.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.642
THOMAS: Yeah, I'm only OK
until I'm not OK.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.888
Then I'm really not.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.491
Delivery in seven days.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.006
Cheque guaranteed.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.408
Won't your Chinese friends
expect the seven tonnes that leaves London

40:18.520 --> 40:20.841
to still be seven tonnes
when it reaches Liverpool?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.691
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.521
Oh, you mean you're bold enough
to skim the Chinese? (CHUCKLES)

40:30.000 --> 40:33.129
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?

40:51.040 --> 40:54.123
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.731
When you've unpacked,
there should be a girl laid on for you.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.491
Mr Shelby is a socialist

41:02.600 --> 41:05.001
and believes in equality of service
for all classes.

41:15.560 --> 41:19.963
According to the invitation,
there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.082
Say that you're feeling tired
and we'll leave.

41:23.760 --> 41:27.731
Well, if you see a duke,
introduce me.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.842
My God, at last!

41:29.960 --> 41:31.883
Something you like about England.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.725
Gina, I've been made an offer.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.567
To come back into the company.

41:42.680 --> 41:43.966
Michael, we agreed,

41:44.080 --> 41:46.924
the baby will be born in New York.
Remember?

41:47.040 --> 41:48.246
The job is haulage.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.970
Supply. Transport.

41:52.960 --> 41:53.961
Opium.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.801
- Tommy has made contact...
- Tommy!

42:01.920 --> 42:04.526
Tommy has made contact
with Chinese suppliers

42:04.640 --> 42:06.449
who have plantations in the Afghan hills.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.161
Pure grade.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.204
We will take delivery
and ship it all over Europe.

42:15.960 --> 42:16.961
You mean heroin?

42:19.040 --> 42:20.041
Yes.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.605
And how much would you make?

42:26.000 --> 42:29.846
Conservative estimate,
three shipments a year from Shanghai,

42:29.960 --> 42:31.485
seven tonnes each,

42:31.600 --> 42:34.171
stand to make approximately
£1 million.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.281
Per annum.

42:37.320 --> 42:38.924
The company will make three.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.526
We could go to New York
whenever we wanted.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.086
On our own fucking plane.

42:51.480 --> 42:54.563
- We always have to come back, right?
- Yes.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.648
For £1 million a year, we do.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.251
What happens if you get caught?

43:02.360 --> 43:03.441
Tommy has friends.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.409
If the ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.250
Think about it, Gina.

43:14.520 --> 43:16.363
When we move into our house...

43:17.560 --> 43:21.360
...our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

43:25.320 --> 43:26.321
Will it now?

43:29.720 --> 43:31.848
The magazines say that

43:31.960 --> 43:35.169
it's all straight lines and simplicity
in the 1930s.

43:36.760 --> 43:37.807
Deco is dead.

43:41.400 --> 43:44.165
We'll be able to afford
dukes and duchesses.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.770
And maybe...

43:47.880 --> 43:49.484
...maybe a princess or two.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.921
And the painting on the wall
will be of you.

43:55.560 --> 43:58.245
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone

43:58.360 --> 44:01.125
and it will be Michael Gray
arranging the ballet.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.726
Where will Tommy be?

44:06.960 --> 44:08.530
Where he wants to go to most.

44:11.560 --> 44:12.971
Ah.

44:14.600 --> 44:15.601
There.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.842
A lord.

44:18.960 --> 44:22.009
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.044
Where the fuck is Tommy anyway?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.081
Tommy...

44:47.200 --> 44:49.567
(GROANS) My house.

44:49.680 --> 44:52.001
- My wife.
- (MOANS)

44:52.120 --> 44:53.281
Let 'em wait.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.121
Sir Oswald.

45:01.640 --> 45:04.246
Do I not get announced?

45:04.360 --> 45:05.805
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you

45:05.920 --> 45:09.083
that he's busy
with the catering preparations

45:09.200 --> 45:11.043
and will be joining you shortly.

45:12.560 --> 45:15.040
In the meantime,
and while you're waiting,

45:15.160 --> 45:18.289
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.443
I don't use opium or cocaine,

45:23.560 --> 45:26.211
and brandy is for after dinner,
not before.

45:27.800 --> 45:31.441
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

45:31.560 --> 45:35.042
You'll notice that
the maids wear name tags.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.010
We hired them specially...

45:39.160 --> 45:42.050
...for those guests staying the night.

45:42.160 --> 45:46.449
All things are available
except the ballerinas.

45:49.120 --> 45:51.043
And who, might I ask, are you?

45:53.160 --> 45:55.686
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.441
And I too am unavailable.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.365
Lizzie.

46:10.480 --> 46:13.768
There's something I didn't tell you
about this evening.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.609
Something about our guest.

46:15.720 --> 46:17.131
Mosley.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.684
It's possible that...

46:21.800 --> 46:23.609
...that you've met him before.

46:23.720 --> 46:24.721
Before when?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.446
Before you became who you are.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.406
Would you even remember him?

46:34.520 --> 46:36.329
Would he remember you?

46:38.600 --> 46:41.570
All I remember is,
I drank too much champagne.

46:41.680 --> 46:43.205
I wasn't taking cash.

46:46.600 --> 46:47.601
Lizzie...

46:50.720 --> 46:52.131
There's a pile of bodies...

46:53.280 --> 46:54.486
...floating by.

46:55.560 --> 46:56.686
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

46:58.560 --> 46:59.766
Let 'em go.

47:03.800 --> 47:05.723
So that's why you brought me
in here.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.524
To lay your claim.

47:09.480 --> 47:10.481
Yeah.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.369
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

47:18.440 --> 47:24.641
He lays a fucking hand on you,
he will be meat forjohnny Dogs.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.843
You were indisposed when I arrived.

47:38.840 --> 47:43.402
In society, you greet a guest,
you don't leave them hanging...

47:43.520 --> 47:45.682
...looking around like a fucking dog.

47:45.800 --> 47:49.885
(CLEARS HIS THROAT) Before we join
the others, I have some business.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.286
I need a signature.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.847
By the way,
your brandy before dinner thing amuses me,

47:54.960 --> 47:57.611
but none of the maids are of interest.

47:57.720 --> 47:59.882
And I despise the use of drugs.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.969
Your strategies are very transparent.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.363
I'm involved in a transaction
with jimmy McCavern,

48:08.480 --> 48:10.847
your acquaintance from the north.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.008
I have no idea who you mean.

48:13.120 --> 48:15.441
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.962
I need your signature
as a guarantor on the transaction

48:19.080 --> 48:20.844
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.883
The sum is £10,000.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.082
And what is it he's buying from you?

48:25.200 --> 48:26.281
A gin distillery.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.323
He's buying my old one.
I'm buying a new one.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.646
Hmm.

48:34.160 --> 48:35.844
So not only is the truce holding,

48:35.960 --> 48:38.440
but you two
are actually doing business.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.166
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.082
If I sign a cheque guarantee
for this man,

48:46.200 --> 48:48.851
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.201
Something you could later use
against me.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.608
Why would I want to move against you?

49:12.240 --> 49:14.322
You're curious about my weaknesses.

49:16.480 --> 49:19.563
And you've learned it's not cocaine,

49:19.680 --> 49:21.409
not maids.

49:30.960 --> 49:35.522
But now you will learn my weakness
is a tendency to trust people.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.051
Do you have a pen?

49:50.680 --> 49:52.011
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

49:53.120 --> 49:54.121
Mr Shelby.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.202
I know you have no classical education,

49:58.320 --> 50:01.403
but just realised you are
the perfect balance between the gods

50:01.520 --> 50:03.488
Dionysus and Apollo.

50:03.600 --> 50:07.764
Irrational frenzy
controlled by reason and self reflection.

50:09.840 --> 50:13.731
Do you know the work
of Friedrich Nietzsche?

50:13.840 --> 50:15.683
- No.
- Freud?

50:15.800 --> 50:17.131
Yes.

50:17.240 --> 50:18.730
Ah.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.886
There.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.241
Your guarantee of trust.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.288
Now perhaps you would introduce me
to your wonderful wife.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.089
So, did you know?

50:39.200 --> 50:40.884
What?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.241
Oh, that tonight's special guest
might have fucked you

50:43.360 --> 50:45.442
when you were a nightclub hostess?

50:45.560 --> 50:46.561
Yeah.

50:48.360 --> 50:51.045
Lizzie, if we were to strike
from our guest lists

50:51.160 --> 50:53.606
every man in Birmingham who you...

50:56.240 --> 50:58.163
- Yes or no?
- Fucking yes.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.281
Shit.

51:03.240 --> 51:06.687
Sir Oswald,
this is my wife Elizabeth.

51:06.800 --> 51:08.689
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.685
Since we all appear to know,

51:12.800 --> 51:15.041
and since knowledge is permission,

51:15.160 --> 51:19.245
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the spirit
of our honest relationship,

51:19.360 --> 51:21.044
you won't mind me saying

51:21.160 --> 51:23.891
it was a bottle of Champagne
and an evening well spent.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.765
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

51:30.320 --> 51:33.005
For the Champagne
and brandy you bought me,

51:33.120 --> 51:37.444
as I recall, it was the booze that put you
to sleep a little prematurely.

51:37.560 --> 51:42.361
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the dance is about to begin.

51:46.880 --> 51:48.803
Mr Mosley!

51:48.920 --> 51:51.127
A toast, if I may.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.766
To the end of our deal,

51:53.880 --> 51:56.281
and the beginning of something more.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.209
Happy Birthday, Lizzie.

52:02.720 --> 52:03.721
This way.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.125
(CLASSICAL MUSIC)

52:37.440 --> 52:39.169
(SNORES)

53:31.840 --> 53:35.128
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen,

53:35.240 --> 53:36.890
will you marry me,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.401
a poor commoner who loves you?

54:35.360 --> 54:40.400
Let's fuck before the swan dies.

55:11.040 --> 55:13.964
I heard there was a family occasion.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.362
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.960
That animal inside me,

55:23.080 --> 55:25.651
it comes out and I can't stop it.

55:27.560 --> 55:29.324
Fuck, Linda.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.169
Without you, I c...

55:31.280 --> 55:33.282
Come inside, please.

55:35.240 --> 55:37.004
His name was Frederick.

55:37.120 --> 55:39.441
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

55:39.560 --> 55:40.891
He just listened.

55:42.560 --> 55:44.608
And now he has no face.

55:52.640 --> 55:56.122
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.962
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

56:08.120 --> 56:09.610
...in fucking hell.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.363
(GUNSHOT)

56:21.160 --> 56:23.845
- Arthur...
- (APPLAUSE IN DISTANCE)

56:33.320 --> 56:35.846
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)
