00:07.181 --> 00:08.205
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.415 --> 00:12.181
You know this, but it's okay for you
to miss him. Hell, I miss him.

00:12.386 --> 00:15.014
It's possible that
he may need surgery.

00:15.222 --> 00:17.520
Do you know what happened to Mobalage?

00:17.725 --> 00:19.625
<i>He was tortured in Nigeria, right?</i>

00:19.827 --> 00:23.490
Mr. Ekabo came into the country
on a forged visa. He's an illegal.

00:23.697 --> 00:26.530
- Send him back to Nigeria?
- INS will start a deportation hearing.

00:26.734 --> 00:29.703
You'll need money if you accept
a cardiothoracic fellowship.

00:29.904 --> 00:33.362
Deciding to track down your birth
parents isn't something to do lightly.

00:33.841 --> 00:34.830
You're what?

00:35.809 --> 00:37.003
I'm pregnant.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.081
Carol?

00:48.923 --> 00:50.220
Doug?

00:52.293 --> 00:55.160
- Mom?
- Oh, you're still here.

00:55.462 --> 00:59.398
I knocked before I used my key.
I thought you had left.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.160
I was just resting. What time is it?

01:03.404 --> 01:06.567
- 8:30.
- Oh, man, I'm late.

01:07.007 --> 01:09.134
- Where's Doug?
- He left.

01:09.343 --> 01:12.642
- I thought you went in together.
- No, not anymore.

01:13.647 --> 01:16.844
I had extra golubtsy
from Yvonne's shower.

01:17.151 --> 01:18.948
I know he likes it.

01:22.623 --> 01:23.612
Are you all right?

01:24.925 --> 01:27.587
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:27.895 --> 01:30.420
I don't know how you stay healthy
working there.

01:31.498 --> 01:33.659
- Have you eaten?
- Not hungry.

01:34.068 --> 01:35.968
Call in sick.
I'll make breakfast.

01:36.437 --> 01:37.802
Ma, I've gotta go.

01:38.505 --> 01:40.029
Lock up when you leave.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.435
- Carol?
- Yeah?

01:42.843 --> 01:44.333
Are you sure you're okay?

01:44.545 --> 01:48.208
I'm fine. We'll talk later,
all right? I'll call you.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.649
Why was it rescheduled?

01:51.952 --> 01:53.783
You're kidding. Reece.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.319
Here. Here you go.

01:56.390 --> 01:57.982
I'm going to a new school for Reece.

01:58.192 --> 02:01.423
They only have open house monthly.
I've missed it twice.

02:01.996 --> 02:05.056
Tell Romano you called
and I wasn't home.

02:05.432 --> 02:08.366
Yeah. No, hey, no, no, no.
I don't want...

02:09.803 --> 02:11.202
Dr. Romano.

02:12.106 --> 02:14.904
No, listen, I'm off this morning.

02:15.109 --> 02:17.577
The earliest I can get there is noon.

02:18.812 --> 02:20.837
Yeah, I know, but I can't...

02:22.616 --> 02:24.846
Hold on. Hold on.
Reece, no!

02:25.052 --> 02:26.815
No, Reece! This is no.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.852
No. No.

02:29.056 --> 02:30.455
That's no.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.014
Go.

02:32.226 --> 02:34.251
Hey, hey. Here, take that.

02:34.461 --> 02:35.485
Play with that.

02:39.266 --> 02:42.599
Yeah, I'm sorry. I have
an important appointment.

02:42.803 --> 02:44.031
I can't...

02:47.307 --> 02:48.296
Yeah.

02:50.511 --> 02:52.775
All right, I'll be there
in half an hour.

02:55.082 --> 02:56.242
Jerk.

02:57.584 --> 02:58.744
Reece?!

03:01.455 --> 03:03.389
No, Reece, not your hearing aid!

03:03.590 --> 03:06.252
No! Oh, damn!

03:07.194 --> 03:10.630
No. No. No.

03:12.699 --> 03:14.633
Mr. Deluz, time for your meds.

03:15.035 --> 03:16.559
Need some help here!

03:16.770 --> 03:18.931
- Just a minute.
- No, now. I need O-2.

03:19.239 --> 03:20.297
We don't provide that.

03:20.507 --> 03:23.601
Then I need pillows to prop her up
to help her breathe.

03:23.811 --> 03:25.073
Of course.

03:27.548 --> 03:29.539
She's really altered.
Is that her baseline?

03:29.750 --> 03:33.914
No, Mrs. Brennan was agitated.
I've got a PRN order for Haldol.

03:34.121 --> 03:36.248
She's hypoxic.
Have you listened to her lungs?

03:36.457 --> 03:39.324
We don't do that.
We're strictly board and care.

03:39.526 --> 03:43.155
You should have called somebody.
She's got pitting edema. Here.

03:43.363 --> 03:46.127
Dr. Davis increased her Lasix
from 40 to 80 milligrams.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.597
- And he hasn't seen her since?
- No.

03:48.869 --> 03:51.429
- We've gotta push IV meds.
- I'm an LVN.

03:51.638 --> 03:53.629
I can arrange for an RN
to come tomorrow.

03:53.841 --> 03:56.867
Tomorrow? She's in congestive
heart failure. Call 911.

03:57.077 --> 03:59.307
- She's DNR.
- Call 911 now.

03:59.513 --> 04:02.175
- You're not her doctor.
- No, I'm her daughter.

04:56.703 --> 04:58.898
Group therapy in your first week?

04:59.106 --> 05:01.574
I only observed the first
weeks of my Psych rotation.

05:01.775 --> 05:04.073
I believe he used the words
"sink or swim."

05:04.278 --> 05:06.041
He's trying to scare you.

05:06.246 --> 05:07.907
I'm actually good at this stuff.

05:08.115 --> 05:09.810
- Mental illness?
- Shut up.

05:10.017 --> 05:11.484
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

05:11.685 --> 05:14.153
Now that you're out of management,
you can slack off.

05:14.354 --> 05:15.685
- Hey, Carol.
- Hi.

05:15.889 --> 05:19.222
- So, Carter, where do you want me?
- I don't know.

05:19.426 --> 05:21.826
Let's see. Why don't you take
the hematuria?

05:22.029 --> 05:24.691
- Later, we'll discuss your plan.
- Okey-doke.

05:24.898 --> 05:27.867
- Did I miss something?
- Carter is Senior-for-the-day.

05:28.068 --> 05:30.332
- For your Chief Resident application?
- Yeah.

05:30.537 --> 05:33.438
For the next eight hours,
if you have a problem, go to him.

05:33.640 --> 05:34.732
- Peachy.
- Good luck.

05:34.942 --> 05:36.842
Jerry, where are all the pens?

05:37.044 --> 05:39.410
Some idiot's idea
of an April Fool's joke.

05:39.613 --> 05:42.741
Well, listen, go down to Supply
and steal a couple.

05:43.850 --> 05:45.647
I got you.

05:46.353 --> 05:48.719
- 1.5 volts. It's pretty cool.
- Real mature.

05:48.922 --> 05:53.256
- Come on. It's April Fool's.
- I'd watch my back if I were you.

05:53.493 --> 05:56.724
I've got a hemorrhoids in Four,
a kid with a fever in Triage.

05:56.930 --> 05:59.490
- Talk to Dr. Carter.
- Dr. Greene.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.168
- How did it go?
- We got a problem.

06:02.369 --> 06:04.496
- Did you get my affidavit?
- Yeah, that's fine.

06:04.705 --> 06:09.005
I get a continuance for disability
if Mobalage remains hospitalized.

06:09.209 --> 06:11.837
Urology still has him
on the surgical service.

06:12.045 --> 06:14.275
INS confirmed he was discharged
this morning.

06:14.481 --> 06:15.880
Where'd you get that?

06:17.117 --> 06:18.778
Elizabeth Corday.

06:21.788 --> 06:23.278
I thought you had an open house.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.822
Weinstein pushed up
a lung resection.

06:26.026 --> 06:28.051
- The cardiothoracic guru?
- Yeah.

06:28.262 --> 06:32.096
He got tickets to a game, so Reece has
to stay in daycare for another month.

06:32.299 --> 06:34.529
It was only in there
for a few seconds.

06:34.735 --> 06:37.465
I want to make sure
that the water didn't damage it.

06:38.505 --> 06:39.836
Reece's hearing aid.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.564
- How much?
- Don't ask.

06:41.775 --> 06:43.800
I know, but is there
any way to test it?

06:44.011 --> 06:46.036
- Peter, Weinstein's ready for us.
- Hold on.

06:46.246 --> 06:47.873
I know. I can't...

06:48.081 --> 06:49.776
- Hey!
- I said, let's go.

06:49.983 --> 06:51.575
- Don't do that.
- I said, let's go.

06:51.785 --> 06:54.117
I'm trying to fix
my son's hearing aid, okay?

06:54.354 --> 06:56.379
One word, Peter. "Nanny."

06:57.924 --> 07:00.051
I can think of a word of my own.

07:01.128 --> 07:03.722
- Get out now, Elizabeth.
- What do you mean?

07:03.930 --> 07:07.331
Soon you'll have your license and
your pick of fifth-year Residencies.

07:07.534 --> 07:10.765
I think I've found a way
to limit my Romano exposure.

07:10.971 --> 07:12.962
Oh, yeah? What's that? Garlic?

07:14.341 --> 07:15.330
Trauma surgery.

07:15.542 --> 07:18.807
Fellowship run out of the ER.
It'll start in July.

07:19.012 --> 07:22.709
- I didn't know there was one.
- There wasn't.

07:22.916 --> 07:25.476
Trauma's the reason
I came to the States.

07:25.686 --> 07:28.416
The hours are better, and I'd have
a semblance of a normal life.

07:29.356 --> 07:32.723
We got disconnected. I had
the hearing aid in the toilet.

07:32.926 --> 07:35.861
I meant to speak to you.
The INS called about Mobalage.

07:36.063 --> 07:38.964
- Did you discharge him?
- I didn't volunteer information.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.464
But I couldn't lie. He was afebrile.

07:41.668 --> 07:43.135
His wound was clean and intact.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.668
- Did you discharge him?
- Yes.

07:44.871 --> 07:45.929
When did he leave?

07:46.139 --> 07:48.903
I don't know if Transport's
taken him down yet. Why?

07:49.109 --> 07:51.942
We're trying to get a physical
disability continuance.

07:52.145 --> 07:53.578
On a pudendal artery bypass?

07:53.780 --> 07:56.806
If he's hospitalized,
we avoid a deportation hearing.

07:57.017 --> 07:58.507
Now he has to see the judge.

07:58.719 --> 08:01.051
One look at the scars
and the judge'll grant him asylum.

08:01.254 --> 08:05.623
It doesn't work that way. Mobalage
has to testify, describe the torture.

08:06.093 --> 08:08.994
- Isn't it obvious?
- Apparently not to the government.

08:09.196 --> 08:13.599
- They need a sworn statement.
- And Mobalage refuses to give it?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.597
I don't think he can.

08:16.536 --> 08:18.731
He was a upset.
I thought it was a nightmare.

08:18.939 --> 08:21.100
- But he wouldn't stop crying.
- Temp's 101.

08:21.308 --> 08:22.673
Now I can't wake him up.

08:22.876 --> 08:24.571
- Is he on any medications?
- No.

08:24.778 --> 08:27.975
- Has he ever been hospitalized?
- Never. He's a healthy kid.

08:28.181 --> 08:30.775
- He could be septic.
- What does that mean?

08:30.984 --> 08:33.214
We need to treat him with antibiotics.

08:33.419 --> 08:36.048
Then perform tests to find
the source of the infection.

08:37.924 --> 08:41.052
- Jerry, is Trauma One open?
- Yeah. You're in early.

08:41.595 --> 08:42.721
Be right back.

08:42.929 --> 08:46.262
- Hey, who's this?
- Critical patient. Pulmonary edema.

08:46.466 --> 08:48.696
BP's borderline and 95
after a fifth nitro spray.

08:48.902 --> 08:50.335
You should only give three.

08:50.537 --> 08:53.233
- I gave it to her.
- You doing a ride-along...?

08:53.440 --> 08:56.307
Set up a nitro drip. Hurry!
I don't want to intubate.

08:57.677 --> 09:00.168
No extraordinary measures.
She's a DNR.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.041
Set up BiPap. We'll go from there.

09:02.249 --> 09:03.648
How's you're breathing, ma'am?

09:03.850 --> 09:05.818
I'm... I'm...

09:06.019 --> 09:09.887
She's altered, Carter. On my count.
One, two, three, gently.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.815
Call upstairs.
See if we have an ICU bed.

09:13.026 --> 09:14.687
Let's get some admit labs.

09:14.895 --> 09:16.419
Chest film, EIKG, blood gas.

09:16.630 --> 09:19.224
BP's 100/75. Resps 20.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.661
Tachy at 130.

09:20.867 --> 09:23.335
I can take it from here, Dr. Weaver.

09:23.537 --> 09:26.199
- Where's my 12-lead?
- I can take it from here.

09:26.406 --> 09:29.000
- This one's mine, Carter.
- I'm Senior-for-the-day.

09:29.209 --> 09:31.109
- I'm running the big board.
- Go run it.

09:35.282 --> 09:38.183
- Carol, where's the nitro?
- I gotta clear an air bubble.

09:38.385 --> 09:40.615
Then give her another
sublingual spray now.

09:42.189 --> 09:45.090
Dr. Sadowinski is an expert
in this kind of case.

09:45.292 --> 09:46.418
I want you to meet him.

09:46.626 --> 09:49.857
- I already talked to a psychiatrist.
- But talk to this one.

09:50.063 --> 09:54.625
- Mobalage, they will send you back.
- He's not been through enough?

09:54.835 --> 09:56.700
- IKobe.
- I don't understand it either.

09:56.903 --> 09:58.370
I'm not an immigration expert.

09:58.572 --> 10:03.066
I do know that you telling your story
is the only way that you can stay.

10:06.012 --> 10:08.776
Let me just get you a little time
to think about it.

10:11.251 --> 10:13.481
I'll take you down to the ER.

10:14.087 --> 10:16.351
You're feverish, pulse is tachy.

10:16.556 --> 10:19.252
If anybody asks you,
you're experiencing belly pain.

10:25.765 --> 10:27.995
I never imagined frozen sperm
would be a good investment.

10:28.201 --> 10:30.362
It's tricky.
You gotta buy the best.

10:30.937 --> 10:32.529
Good of you to join us, Peter.

10:32.739 --> 10:34.969
Sorry. I had to rearrange
my schedule.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.609
In 10 years you get
to set the schedule.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.745
So you only inseminate Arabians?

10:39.946 --> 10:41.379
No, Thoroughbreds too.

10:41.581 --> 10:43.947
Remind me, I'll get you a brochure.

10:44.351 --> 10:47.252
- You like horses, Peter?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:47.454 --> 10:48.853
Yeah. Neither did I.

10:49.055 --> 10:51.421
They got a big upside
once you know what you're doing.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.183
- IKeep that in mind.
- Thanks.

10:53.393 --> 10:56.794
Your office is on the phone. A sales
rep from Symatac is waiting for you.

10:57.230 --> 10:59.630
Oh, damn! I forgot.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.495
The guy's gonna comp me
a new thoracoscope.

11:02.702 --> 11:04.499
Okay if we push this back to 1?

11:05.672 --> 11:06.969
Yeah, sure. No sweat.

11:07.674 --> 11:09.335
Okay. I'll see you then.

11:19.219 --> 11:21.551
- End of shift?
- Oh, no. Just started.

11:21.755 --> 11:25.350
- You?
- Post call. Six hours to go.

11:25.559 --> 11:29.461
- This internship's never gonna end.
- It always feels like that.

11:30.030 --> 11:32.430
That looks really good. I'm famished.

11:32.666 --> 11:34.497
I just can't eat anything, you know?

11:34.701 --> 11:36.999
I'm trying
to keep something down, but...

11:38.872 --> 11:39.861
Here.

11:40.473 --> 11:41.462
Thanks.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.605
- Morning sickness?
- Yeah.

11:45.445 --> 11:47.310
And I'm really, really tired.

11:47.714 --> 11:49.306
Have you seen your OB?

11:50.984 --> 11:52.849
You've not made a decision.

11:53.386 --> 11:56.321
Three months ago I worried
that I couldn't get pregnant.

11:56.523 --> 11:59.549
And now here I am, all alone.

11:59.759 --> 12:01.818
I wanted to have a baby with Doug.

12:02.028 --> 12:04.428
I don't want to be a single mother.

12:04.631 --> 12:07.361
Do you have to be?
Have you spoken with Doug?

12:09.836 --> 12:12.930
I see all these pregnant women
parading through here...

12:13.139 --> 12:15.835
...Iost, frightened,
not knowing what to do.

12:16.042 --> 12:17.771
And what do you tell them?

12:18.445 --> 12:21.175
I say, "Go with your gut.
Most of the time it's right."

12:21.381 --> 12:23.508
So, what does yours tell you?

12:24.751 --> 12:25.877
I don't know.

12:30.023 --> 12:32.150
I need somebody from Surgery onboard.

12:32.359 --> 12:36.261
You discharged Mobalage. So according
to bounce-back rules, he's yours.

12:36.463 --> 12:38.988
I know, but there's nothing wrong
with him.

12:39.199 --> 12:42.168
The incision looks a little
erythematous around the sutures.

12:42.369 --> 12:44.428
- Could be wound infection.
- Mark.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.469
I don't need you to take him.

12:46.673 --> 12:50.109
Sign the readmit orders and
we'll observe him down here in the ER.

12:50.310 --> 12:53.677
- You want me to falsify his chart.
- I'm just trying to buy him some time.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.112
His lawyer's on his way to the judge
to tell him he's being readmitted.

12:58.318 --> 13:00.309
You're asking me to sign my name
to a lie.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.617
I'm asking you to help him.

13:05.091 --> 13:06.080
Give it to me.

13:08.328 --> 13:09.556
Thank you.

13:14.167 --> 13:16.658
Mark, can I get you
to see a couple of patients?

13:16.870 --> 13:18.303
In a second, Carter.

13:19.739 --> 13:22.003
- Did you steal my stethoscope?
- No, haven't seen it.

13:22.208 --> 13:25.666
- Why will they pick that pen?
- Because it's shiny.

13:25.879 --> 13:30.009
Malik, I need postural vital signs
on Bed Three...

13:30.750 --> 13:32.684
...and you can discharge Mr. Dudley.

13:32.886 --> 13:35.582
- Jerry, I need it.
- What makes you think I took it?

13:35.789 --> 13:37.757
- Come on, man!
- Stealing stuff?

13:37.957 --> 13:39.754
Where's the creativity in that?

13:39.959 --> 13:42.359
There must be a contact person
for the Board and Care.

13:42.562 --> 13:45.463
No, her fees are paid for
out of a pension.

13:45.665 --> 13:47.633
Thank God you found her.
She was abandoned.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.665
She was gonna die there alone.

13:49.869 --> 13:51.530
Sometimes they're gone
before we find them.

13:52.072 --> 13:54.734
Can you do more?
Find out where's she from?

13:54.941 --> 13:57.637
Any other children?
Maybe find my father?

13:57.844 --> 14:00.438
Sure, I'll check it out.
Page me if you need anything.

14:00.647 --> 14:01.636
Thanks.

14:14.294 --> 14:16.228
Is that you, Claire?

14:17.564 --> 14:19.088
No, my name is IKerry.

14:24.804 --> 14:28.570
You were having trouble breathing.
We had to bring you to the hospital.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.768
Hospital?

14:32.312 --> 14:37.306
Don't worry. We're gonna take
very good care of you, I promise.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.283
He's still tachycardic.

14:42.489 --> 14:45.583
Okay. Let's add a blood
and urine tox screen.

14:45.792 --> 14:48.283
Could he have ingested something
from the medicine cabinet?

14:48.495 --> 14:51.328
No, I don't think so.
I thought it was an infection.

14:51.531 --> 14:53.021
His pupils are dilated.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.996
BP's up to 170/90.

14:55.201 --> 14:57.669
Anything? Cold medicine,
nicotine, bug spray?

14:57.871 --> 15:00.499
- All that stuff's put away.
- Your house is childproofed?

15:00.940 --> 15:04.569
No, I only have him every so often.
He sleeps in my room.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.643
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:06.846 --> 15:09.076
- No, the drawer was closed.
- What was in it?

15:09.282 --> 15:11.512
There are different treatments
for different toxins.

15:11.718 --> 15:14.016
If I don't know what toxin,
he could die.

15:14.454 --> 15:17.753
- It was only like half a gram.
- Half a gram of what? Cocaine?

15:18.691 --> 15:21.956
Get Dr. Greene. NG tube,
activated charcoal, start IV.

15:22.162 --> 15:23.686
Esmolol, 50 mics
per kilo per minute.

15:23.897 --> 15:26.058
- You should wait outside.
- I want to be with him.

15:26.266 --> 15:28.427
- This is going to be messy.
- That's all right.

15:28.735 --> 15:32.000
- Haleh?
- Out. Now.

16:12.779 --> 16:15.111
I need an ICU bed.
She needs aggressive diuresis.

16:15.315 --> 16:16.782
I thought the beta blockade
would do it.

16:16.983 --> 16:19.508
If you must, add phentolamine.

16:19.719 --> 16:21.380
It was a good pickup, though.

16:21.588 --> 16:23.453
Dr. Weaver, did you hear about this?

16:23.656 --> 16:26.420
Guy leaves his cocaine where
his 3-year-old can find it.

16:26.626 --> 16:29.094
Did you call DCFS? What the hell?!

16:29.295 --> 16:30.159
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

16:30.363 --> 16:33.730
Dr. Greene,
Mobalage is asking for you.

16:33.933 --> 16:35.161
Is Dr. Sadowinski here?

16:35.368 --> 16:38.030
Yes, but Mobalage wants you there.
He trusts you.

16:38.404 --> 16:41.532
Red-blanket baby on the way. A
schizophrenic delivered in the street.

16:41.774 --> 16:44.504
- Carter, you got it?
- Sure. Yeah.

16:44.711 --> 16:45.700
Give me a hand?

16:48.848 --> 16:52.181
I don't know.
There was a hood over my face.

16:59.792 --> 17:00.986
Were you frightened?

17:03.029 --> 17:04.997
I thought I was about to die.

17:07.901 --> 17:08.925
Then what?

17:14.574 --> 17:16.598
They took you to a cell?

17:17.410 --> 17:18.398
Yes.

17:18.711 --> 17:20.178
What kind of cell?

17:25.752 --> 17:27.117
It was cold.

17:27.854 --> 17:29.412
What did it look like?

17:34.294 --> 17:35.727
I don't know, sir.

17:37.997 --> 17:39.794
They kept the hood on your head?

17:39.999 --> 17:41.057
Yes.

17:46.739 --> 17:47.831
Then what?

17:52.478 --> 17:54.309
They came and got you?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.788
How long before they came back?

18:06.392 --> 18:09.555
Mobalage, what happened next?

18:13.566 --> 18:14.726
I cannot tell you.

18:14.934 --> 18:16.026
Why?

18:16.235 --> 18:18.635
Because I do not remember.

18:27.246 --> 18:30.511
She was in the street
holding the newborn baby.

18:30.717 --> 18:32.184
It was still wet
with amniotic fluid.

18:32.418 --> 18:33.646
BP's 140/90.

18:33.853 --> 18:36.822
- How much blood loss?
- About a pad since we found her.

18:37.023 --> 18:38.615
Start an IV. Call OB.

18:38.825 --> 18:40.588
Okay. Good breath sounds.

18:40.793 --> 18:42.317
No. Where's my baby?

18:42.528 --> 18:45.258
- How did she cut her forehead?
- She fell on the sidewalk.

18:45.465 --> 18:47.899
- Did they find the placenta?
- She said a dog ate it.

18:48.101 --> 18:50.262
Okay, irrigate this scalp lac.

18:50.470 --> 18:52.495
Get me a speculum. I'll do a pelvic.

18:52.705 --> 18:57.039
Please, please, please.
Where is my baby? Where?

18:57.243 --> 18:59.677
I'll go check on him right now.
All right? Okay?

18:59.879 --> 19:03.042
Give her five of Haldol, IM.
I'll be right back.

19:04.650 --> 19:07.016
How's the mother?
She needs her head sutured.

19:07.220 --> 19:09.313
And I'm putting her on Haldol.
How's it going?

19:09.522 --> 19:11.888
Mottled and lethargic initially.
He's warming up.

19:12.091 --> 19:14.150
Good color, good tone, pulse 140.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.828
- Looks full-term.
- What is that?

19:17.030 --> 19:20.022
- Is that a garbage tie?
- At least she knew to clamp it off.

19:20.233 --> 19:22.326
Get me an umbilical clamp and some
Betadine.

19:22.535 --> 19:24.002
- Need to do a heel stick?
- Yeah.

19:24.203 --> 19:26.637
- Where are the 22 butterflies?
- Pedes.

19:27.673 --> 19:30.164
Let's get a newborn screen
and a cap gas.

19:30.376 --> 19:32.503
She stole my baby.

19:33.146 --> 19:34.340
Give him back to me.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.477
Honey, you have to go lie down.

19:36.682 --> 19:38.775
- No!
- Haleh, call Security.

19:38.985 --> 19:41.453
You can't have him. He's mine.

19:41.654 --> 19:43.053
We're taking care of him.

19:43.656 --> 19:44.588
Can I hold him?

19:44.791 --> 19:46.782
Not now. Let's go
in the other room...

19:46.993 --> 19:49.359
...and stitch that cut
on your forehead.

19:49.562 --> 19:51.826
Then you can see him.
I promise.

19:52.031 --> 19:53.726
- I love my baby.
- I know.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.992
- I love my baby.
- Yeah. Okay.

19:56.202 --> 19:57.066
No!

20:00.506 --> 20:02.133
Give him back to me!
Give him to me!

20:02.341 --> 20:04.138
- Coco, let go of me.
- He's mine!

20:04.343 --> 20:06.811
- Let go. Coco!
- No! No!

20:07.013 --> 20:08.071
Help!

20:08.981 --> 20:10.414
He's my baby!

20:12.051 --> 20:14.611
He's my baby!

20:14.987 --> 20:17.387
No! You can't have him!

20:17.590 --> 20:22.425
He's mine! No! No!

20:22.662 --> 20:25.688
- Any signs of trauma?
- No, he seems okay.

20:26.599 --> 20:30.000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:37.510 --> 20:41.310
- IKerry, you got a minute?
- Lf you want to walk with me.

20:41.514 --> 20:43.744
What'll we do
with our sternal saw study?

20:43.950 --> 20:47.545
As soon as I've finished compiling
the data, I'll pass it on to you.

20:47.753 --> 20:49.550
We should write a paper together.

20:49.755 --> 20:52.918
I assumed that you'd want
to write yours separately.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.118
- Why would you think that?
- Different specialties and journals.

20:56.329 --> 20:58.229
A joint study should be a joint paper.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.956
It's suited for an emergency
medicine journal.

21:01.167 --> 21:04.000
- Sure, Peter, that'd be great.
- Okay, I'll call you.

21:04.203 --> 21:06.535
Hey, IKerry, you know, I heard...

21:06.739 --> 21:09.867
...there might be
a surgical trauma fellowship.

21:10.076 --> 21:12.636
- Did Romano tell you that?
- No. Why?

21:13.212 --> 21:16.010
Confidentially, we're trying
to go around him.

21:16.816 --> 21:20.843
Oh, well, that makes sense.
Is it an open application process?

21:21.053 --> 21:23.749
Anspaugh's taking it to the board
next week. Interested?

21:24.690 --> 21:27.659
- Well, I might be.
- Okay. I'll let you know.

21:27.860 --> 21:28.849
Thanks.

21:29.795 --> 21:30.784
I had him readmitted.

21:30.997 --> 21:33.488
The judge suspects we're stalling.
Which we are.

21:33.699 --> 21:35.564
- I'll talk to him.
- Doesn't matter.

21:35.768 --> 21:38.464
Government prosecutors come
tomorrow to take a deposition.

21:38.671 --> 21:41.037
Then the court will make its decision.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.231
He won't be able
to tell them anything.

21:43.442 --> 21:45.774
If he wants to stay, he'll have to.

21:45.978 --> 21:48.845
- He doesn't remember.
- Anything?

21:49.048 --> 21:53.144
- The abduction. Not the torture.
- They've seen posttraumatic stress.

21:53.352 --> 21:56.048
People claim it all the time.
That's the problem.

21:56.255 --> 21:58.621
- We have physical evidence.
- I'm not arguing.

21:58.824 --> 22:01.054
I'm simply telling you
what the reality is.

22:01.260 --> 22:05.196
Without a sworn statement specific
to the torture, it can go either way.

22:07.233 --> 22:10.964
- How is the baby doing?
- Blood glucose is good. Up to 68.

22:11.170 --> 22:12.535
He's eating like a champ.

22:12.738 --> 22:16.174
- Good. How are we doing in here?
- She's throwing PVCs.

22:16.709 --> 22:18.006
She's gorked out.

22:18.411 --> 22:19.776
- How long?
- What?

22:19.979 --> 22:21.606
Has she been throwing PVCs?

22:21.814 --> 22:24.214
- I don't know.
- You should've called me.

22:24.417 --> 22:27.386
- She's DNR.
- I'm working on an ICU bed for her.

22:28.120 --> 22:32.318
- Did her family change their mind?
- No. There isn't any family.

22:32.892 --> 22:35.986
Well, that makes it easier,
less complicated.

22:49.976 --> 22:53.104
- Why is that guy still in Four?
- He's waiting on a cab.

22:53.312 --> 22:55.371
For 55 minutes? Come on.
I need the bed.

22:55.581 --> 22:57.640
- Dr. Greene told me to talk to you.
- Make it fast.

22:57.850 --> 23:00.114
- Time clock's broken.
- Call Administration.

23:00.319 --> 23:02.310
I did. I can't work
until they fix it.

23:02.521 --> 23:05.786
- Note the time on the card.
- Can't. They're afraid we'll cheat.

23:05.992 --> 23:09.052
- Clock in upstairs then.
- It's on a different system.

23:10.229 --> 23:11.890
Nice try. April Fool's?

23:12.098 --> 23:13.861
- You blew it.
- He was getting mad.

23:14.066 --> 23:16.626
- Chuny, I thought better of you.
- Malik put me up to it.

23:16.836 --> 23:18.667
- Blame the brother.
- Have a pen.

23:18.871 --> 23:19.860
Thanks.

23:20.072 --> 23:21.630
What's the deal with CT?

23:21.841 --> 23:23.604
I got three patients holding.

23:23.809 --> 23:25.868
Crashed. Computer guy's working
on it.

23:26.078 --> 23:27.272
- How long?
- Four hours.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.471
Four hours?! You serious?

23:29.682 --> 23:31.081
When am I not serious?

23:32.084 --> 23:34.450
Jerry, we're closed to neuro trauma.

23:34.654 --> 23:37.885
- I'll call Weaver.
- No, I'm Senior-for-the day!

23:38.090 --> 23:40.854
- CT's down. We're closed to neuro.
- Whatever you say.

23:41.060 --> 23:44.052
We got another one. Four-month-old
female. High fever, cough.

23:44.263 --> 23:46.231
I'll be right there.
Sam, don't go anywhere.

23:46.432 --> 23:48.627
I may need a wet read on a chest film.

23:49.435 --> 23:50.629
What are you doing?

23:50.836 --> 23:53.737
We need to massage your uterus
to help shrink it.

23:54.707 --> 23:58.473
- It closes off all the blood vessels?
- That's right.

23:59.345 --> 24:00.744
I read that.

24:02.948 --> 24:04.176
I'm sorry.

24:04.650 --> 24:07.448
I didn't mean to attack you.

24:07.653 --> 24:11.384
I get crazy without my meds.

24:11.590 --> 24:13.182
I understand.

24:16.295 --> 24:17.455
How's my baby?

24:17.663 --> 24:20.894
He's great. He's in the nursery,
and they're taking good care of him.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.967
But he's healthy, right?
There's nothing wrong with him?

24:24.170 --> 24:25.831
No, no, no. He's perfect.

24:29.175 --> 24:32.008
I went off the drugs
for the pregnancy.

24:32.211 --> 24:33.269
I know.

24:33.479 --> 24:35.470
I didn't want them to hurt him.

24:36.382 --> 24:38.145
- I know.
- I thought about it.

24:38.351 --> 24:41.081
I knew what I was doing.
I knew I was taking a risk.

24:41.287 --> 24:46.054
That I could get out of control,
end up on the street.

24:46.258 --> 24:49.716
But it worked. I made it.

24:50.129 --> 24:52.495
You got lucky. But it's not over.

24:53.566 --> 24:56.967
I can go back home.
I'll stay on the medication.

24:57.169 --> 24:58.898
I know that I have to.

24:59.405 --> 25:00.736
Not for me. For him.

25:00.940 --> 25:04.467
Coco, we're not talking about a month,
or six months, or a year.

25:04.677 --> 25:05.666
You can't ever stop.

25:05.878 --> 25:09.075
I won't. I love him already.

25:11.016 --> 25:13.644
I loved just the idea of him.

25:15.287 --> 25:18.313
That's all that really matters, right?

25:21.127 --> 25:22.924
They'll let me keep him, won't they?

25:23.462 --> 25:25.327
- We'll see.
- No, no!

25:25.531 --> 25:27.089
They can't take him away.

25:27.566 --> 25:30.160
- Please. Please help me.
- You need to rest.

25:30.369 --> 25:32.963
Hi. My name is Lucy IKnight.

25:33.172 --> 25:34.730
I'm a student. How are you feeling?

25:40.980 --> 25:43.244
Michael! Stop it! Be still.

25:43.449 --> 25:45.542
- You want a fourth tube?
- Might as well.

25:45.751 --> 25:47.116
Fluid looks pretty clear.

25:47.319 --> 25:48.650
- That's good?
- Yes.

25:48.854 --> 25:51.846
If it's a bad infection,
the fluid can be cloudy.

25:52.057 --> 25:54.525
We still need to send these tubes
to the lab.

25:55.394 --> 25:56.554
Michael!

25:58.697 --> 26:01.325
- You got a second?
- Be with you in one minute.

26:01.534 --> 26:02.466
Hold him still.

26:04.303 --> 26:06.635
Okay. I will be right back.

26:07.139 --> 26:08.436
Gram's stain and culture in One.

26:08.641 --> 26:12.304
Glucose and protein in Two,
and cell count in Three.

26:12.511 --> 26:14.638
- What do we got?
- You tell me.

26:17.349 --> 26:19.078
What's wrong with this picture?

26:22.354 --> 26:24.379
- Are those rib fractures?
- Four.

26:24.590 --> 26:29.118
One, two, three, four.
Any signs of abuse?

26:29.328 --> 26:30.522
I didn't see any ecchymoses.

26:30.729 --> 26:32.890
Bruises heal on infants
pretty quickly.

26:37.269 --> 26:38.964
- Chuny?
- Yeah?

26:39.171 --> 26:41.867
Get DCFS on the phone
and call Security.

26:42.074 --> 26:44.702
I want a full bone survey.
Skull, long bones, the works.

26:44.910 --> 26:47.071
Let's take them now
before the inquisition.

26:49.715 --> 26:52.616
Mrs. Leason, there's a problem
with the chest x-ray.

26:52.985 --> 26:54.748
- What kind of problem?
- Don't worry.

26:54.954 --> 26:58.253
It's fuzzy. Maybe she moved.
But we need to try again.

26:59.992 --> 27:02.961
- Can I go with her?
- It's better if you stay here.

27:03.762 --> 27:06.856
I said, stop it!
Your sister is sick!

27:07.533 --> 27:09.091
Mrs. Leason, take it easy.

27:10.436 --> 27:11.869
I'm fine.

27:15.207 --> 27:16.196
What's this?

27:16.575 --> 27:20.136
We found old fractures that look
like the result of trauma.

27:20.446 --> 27:23.142
- What?
- By law, I'm required to report them.

27:23.916 --> 27:26.350
I thought you said
the x-ray was fuzzy.

27:26.552 --> 27:29.521
- We need to document a complete set.
- Document what?

27:30.489 --> 27:31.820
How did Michael break his arm?

27:34.360 --> 27:35.657
He fell off the bed!

27:36.962 --> 27:40.557
A representative of the DCFS
is coming to talk to you.

27:40.766 --> 27:44.167
- The hell they will! I'm leaving.
- Not with your children.

27:44.904 --> 27:49.238
I brought my baby because she's sick.
And now you want to take my children?

27:49.441 --> 27:51.432
She doesn't leave with this one.

27:51.644 --> 27:54.112
- I'll call the police.
- You call the police!

27:54.313 --> 27:56.804
You don't know what you're saying!
You can't do this!

27:57.016 --> 27:58.381
Yes, I can!

28:01.654 --> 28:04.817
They let Mobalage live
for people to see him broken.

28:05.024 --> 28:07.083
To set an example.

28:07.293 --> 28:09.386
Why? What did he do?

28:09.595 --> 28:11.688
He wrote a short story.

28:13.432 --> 28:15.593
They saw it as a call for revolution.

28:15.935 --> 28:16.924
Was it?

28:19.838 --> 28:21.271
I didn't know he was a writer.

28:21.473 --> 28:23.134
He's an engineer.

28:23.709 --> 28:26.405
But he was a romantic to me.

28:26.612 --> 28:30.207
Not as you see him today.
He was warm and funny.

28:30.849 --> 28:32.009
Energetic.

28:32.217 --> 28:36.449
IKobe, I need to know things
about the torture.

28:37.556 --> 28:40.081
Anything that could help spark
his memory.

28:40.292 --> 28:41.589
We don't speak of it.

28:41.827 --> 28:43.852
You must know the sort
of things they did.

28:44.063 --> 28:46.793
You can see the sort of things
they did.

28:48.233 --> 28:52.567
I was thinking more of where,
how long, when?

28:53.072 --> 28:56.564
- Details.
- I cannot give you details.

28:57.676 --> 28:59.166
I wish I could.

29:02.314 --> 29:04.646
When will we have to go?

29:05.184 --> 29:08.119
Your visa's valid.
It's only Mobalage.

29:08.854 --> 29:10.583
When will we have to go?

29:12.958 --> 29:14.255
I don't know.

29:17.796 --> 29:18.888
Thank you.

29:19.565 --> 29:20.554
For what?

29:21.500 --> 29:23.297
You've been very kind.

29:24.536 --> 29:25.730
I want to help him.

29:26.839 --> 29:28.204
So do I.

29:31.043 --> 29:32.601
- Hey, IKerry.
- Hey.

29:32.811 --> 29:34.836
I was checking vitals on Mrs. Brennan.

29:35.047 --> 29:37.481
- Chart says you pushed lidocaine.
- That's right.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.212
Did her DNR status change?

29:39.418 --> 29:42.478
"Do Not Resuscitate" does not mean
"Do Not Treat."

29:42.688 --> 29:45.987
- You treated an arrhythmia.
- Yeah, that's not resuscitation.

29:46.492 --> 29:47.516
So you won't intubate?

29:47.726 --> 29:51.457
She's my patient, and I'll make
a judgment call if it comes to that.

29:52.364 --> 29:54.832
A "judgment call"?
Isn't that hypocritical?

29:55.034 --> 29:56.001
What?

29:56.335 --> 29:58.565
Doug made judgment calls,
what he thought was best.

29:58.771 --> 30:02.263
- Carol, Doug created his own problems.
- You didn't help much.

30:02.941 --> 30:06.206
Is that what you think?
That I drove him out of here?

30:06.445 --> 30:08.208
No. But I know you wanted him out.

30:08.881 --> 30:10.542
I won't have this conversation.

30:10.749 --> 30:12.341
He didn't go against their wishes.

30:12.551 --> 30:14.815
- No, this is different.
- How, IKerry?

30:15.020 --> 30:19.320
She is my mother. Mrs. Brennan...
Mrs. Brennan is my mother.

30:20.959 --> 30:22.722
Why didn't you tell me?

30:25.197 --> 30:26.926
I don't know.

30:27.132 --> 30:28.997
I was adopted.

30:29.568 --> 30:30.865
And I hired...

30:31.136 --> 30:34.902
I hired this private detective
to find her.

30:36.241 --> 30:38.334
I never imagined it would happen
like this.

30:39.812 --> 30:42.747
I didn't expect to find an old woman.

30:43.816 --> 30:45.716
I always thought
that she was probably...

30:45.918 --> 30:49.149
...some scared teenager
who couldn't keep me. I...

30:50.856 --> 30:54.986
I thought that I would have more time,
have some kind of...

30:55.327 --> 30:58.763
...meaningful conversation,
ask her questions.

30:58.964 --> 31:02.161
But the minute I find her,
she's dying.

31:03.235 --> 31:05.533
IKerry, I'm so sorry.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.467
It's not your problem.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.901
She's hemacult positive. Crit's down.

31:10.109 --> 31:14.705
I'm gonna call for a GI consult.
Type and cross-match two units, okay?

31:24.123 --> 31:26.387
You know your way
around a resection, Peter.

31:26.592 --> 31:28.116
But do more homework.

31:28.327 --> 31:30.488
We keep him busy. Want some coffee?

31:30.696 --> 31:32.823
No, thanks.
I can make the third inning.

31:33.031 --> 31:35.761
- Always a pleasure, gentlemen.
- You bet. Take care.

31:35.968 --> 31:37.333
See you later, you jerk.

31:37.536 --> 31:40.096
Don't worry. I didn't
know the answer to that question.

31:40.305 --> 31:43.968
- No, I should be more prepared.
- Go home. See your munchkin.

31:44.176 --> 31:47.839
- His name is Reece.
- Oh, like "Reese's Pieces." Cute.

31:48.347 --> 31:50.110
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:50.315 --> 31:53.478
- How'd it go?
- Fine, I guess.

31:54.353 --> 31:56.082
Not exciting enough for you?

31:56.288 --> 31:57.687
No. It was...

31:58.557 --> 31:59.751
...interesting.

32:01.093 --> 32:04.551
So why did you feel the need
to poach my meager ambitions?

32:04.863 --> 32:05.852
What?

32:06.165 --> 32:09.100
I spoke with IKerry Weaver about
the status of the fellowship.

32:09.301 --> 32:11.565
There might be
a selection committee.

32:11.770 --> 32:13.635
There is other interest.

32:13.839 --> 32:15.136
Was that you?

32:16.074 --> 32:17.439
I mentioned something.

32:19.778 --> 32:21.712
Peter, I told you in confidence.

32:21.914 --> 32:25.714
I wouldn't have said anything if
I thought you'd try and steal it.

32:26.218 --> 32:27.310
It's already yours?

32:28.020 --> 32:31.183
It was my idea. I brought it
to Greene and Weaver.

32:31.723 --> 32:33.486
I'm sorry. You didn't tell me.

32:33.692 --> 32:34.784
Peter.

32:34.993 --> 32:38.224
Look, I didn't say I wanted it.
I was just asking.

32:38.430 --> 32:42.423
Then let me know when you decide.
I'll go ahead and plan my life.

32:42.634 --> 32:44.602
Elizabeth, it's not like that.

32:45.904 --> 32:47.201
It's just that...

32:48.240 --> 32:50.572
Things aren't working out right now.

32:50.776 --> 32:52.505
I don't like cardiothoracic.

32:52.711 --> 32:54.338
Oh, what? So trauma's a backup?

32:54.546 --> 32:57.310
No. I just thought
that this might make sense.

32:57.516 --> 32:59.950
I can't spend five years
as an indentured servant.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.483
I need time for Reece.

33:02.254 --> 33:03.915
- Now, that's low.
- What?

33:04.122 --> 33:07.751
I know you love him, but don't use him
as an excuse to screw me over.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.952
Take it! I don't want it!
I'll find something else!

33:11.163 --> 33:12.790
I don't want you to forfeit it!

33:12.998 --> 33:16.229
If you want it, you go for it!
I'll still get it!

33:19.738 --> 33:21.000
How are those films?

33:21.206 --> 33:23.697
Come in. You're gonna want
to see this.

33:23.942 --> 33:26.740
- Whose is this?
- I don't know, it's been here all day.

33:26.945 --> 33:28.845
I've looked everywhere for this.

33:31.884 --> 33:36.287
Twenty-eight different fractures
total. Not all calcified.

33:36.488 --> 33:38.581
Bilateral humerus. Left femur.

33:38.790 --> 33:41.452
Right tib-fib.
Linear involvement of the skull.

33:41.660 --> 33:43.059
What did she do to this kid?

33:43.262 --> 33:45.730
We should get a head CT.
There's some pleural scarring.

33:45.931 --> 33:48.491
Possibly a spontaneously
healed pneumothorax.

33:49.134 --> 33:50.362
Wait, what is this?

33:50.569 --> 33:52.093
Fracture of the eighth rib.

33:52.337 --> 33:55.704
I thought there were
only four rib fractures.

33:55.908 --> 33:56.840
There's five here.

33:57.376 --> 33:59.401
- You sure this is hers?
- Yeah. I took a whole new set.

33:59.611 --> 34:00.908
Where's the old one?

34:10.022 --> 34:11.887
- Same technique?
- Yeah.

34:12.090 --> 34:13.489
So where's the fifth fracture?

34:14.893 --> 34:17.726
- There isn't one.
- What? It happened in the ER.

34:17.929 --> 34:20.455
- Did you press on her chest?
- I held her down to do the LP.

34:20.666 --> 34:23.226
It could be osteogenesis imperfecta.

34:23.435 --> 34:24.697
I did it?

34:24.902 --> 34:28.304
- The bones break like glass.
- Oh, man! Oh, man!

34:28.507 --> 34:31.704
I went right to abuse.
I didn't even think about OI.

34:31.909 --> 34:35.175
- Did you call Social Services?
- The cops are talking to her.

34:35.380 --> 34:39.179
Well, honest mistake.
Better to be safe, right?

34:39.384 --> 34:43.717
How do I go from "Sorry I accused you"
to "She has a terrible disease"?

34:44.489 --> 34:47.219
You should put on a jacket.
It's still nippy out here.

34:47.426 --> 34:48.757
I'm ready for spring.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.656
I got your page in the car.

34:50.862 --> 34:53.524
- How is she?
- She's dying.

34:55.833 --> 34:59.361
I got some preliminary info for you.
You want to hear?

34:59.571 --> 35:03.234
Cathy Brennan. She was a stewardess
when they called them "stewardesses."

35:03.442 --> 35:05.000
Married two years after you.

35:05.210 --> 35:07.610
Not to your father.
I'm still working on that.

35:07.813 --> 35:10.509
Divorced six years later.
One child, a daughter...

35:10.716 --> 35:13.514
...Claire. Died in a car accident
in her mid-20s.

35:14.953 --> 35:16.215
Are you okay?

35:17.022 --> 35:20.150
Did you know that her blood type
was O-positive?

35:20.659 --> 35:22.718
We don't usually get that information.

35:22.928 --> 35:25.795
I typed her blood
since I was gonna put her in the ICU.

35:25.998 --> 35:29.456
She didn't want that.
But somehow I thought I had the right.

35:29.668 --> 35:30.965
It's a natural reaction.

35:31.169 --> 35:35.128
I'm AB. It's impossible
for that woman to be my mother.

35:36.575 --> 35:38.668
- Are you sure?
- It's basic hematology.

35:38.877 --> 35:41.812
"A" plus "B" equals "AB."
There's no "O" in the equation.

35:42.681 --> 35:44.273
I'll call my guy at the office.

35:44.483 --> 35:47.281
He stole a peek at the file.
He must have read it wrong.

35:48.387 --> 35:52.016
- You should be more careful.
- The info's there. I can get it.

35:53.158 --> 35:54.591
You're not gonna quit?

35:54.793 --> 35:56.920
It's my fault. Don't let it
undermine your resolve.

35:57.129 --> 35:58.562
You're fired.

36:00.165 --> 36:01.223
- Hey, Carter.
- Hi.

36:01.433 --> 36:03.765
- How many patients do you have?
- One. I got a good case.

36:03.969 --> 36:06.995
- A schizophrenic had a baby.
- Yeah, I know. I was there.

36:07.205 --> 36:09.833
- Right. How's Senior-for-a-day?
- Not over yet.

36:10.042 --> 36:11.566
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

36:11.777 --> 36:13.938
Have you called your Resident
about Coco?

36:14.146 --> 36:17.172
No, I have to complete
a comprehensive mental status exam.

36:17.382 --> 36:21.512
- I'm presenting her at Chief rounds.
- You need to call your Resident now.

36:22.487 --> 36:23.476
Is something wrong?

36:24.389 --> 36:27.654
Coco's dealt with
a lot of psychiatrists.

36:27.993 --> 36:28.982
I bet.

36:29.194 --> 36:31.458
She feels you're too inexperienced.

36:31.663 --> 36:33.528
A schizophrenic thinks
I'm unqualified?

36:34.166 --> 36:35.690
She's asked for someone else.

36:36.535 --> 36:37.559
Can she do that?

36:37.869 --> 36:41.703
She's got a lot at stake, Lucy.
She's worried. Call your Resident.

36:48.847 --> 36:50.815
Dr. Greene, can I ask you something?

36:51.016 --> 36:52.278
Sure, Jerry.

36:53.218 --> 36:55.982
What does it mean
if your piss turns blue?

36:56.188 --> 36:58.156
Just out of curiosity?

36:58.890 --> 37:00.152
My piss is blue.

37:00.525 --> 37:01.514
Dark blue.

37:02.594 --> 37:03.720
Somebody got you.

37:06.898 --> 37:09.230
How could they change
my bodily fluids?

37:09.434 --> 37:12.995
- Did you eat anything you didn't make?
- Brownies in the lounge.

37:14.639 --> 37:17.005
Oh, man! It's not toxic, is it?

37:17.209 --> 37:20.576
It's probably methylene blue.
Let me know if it starts burning.

37:20.912 --> 37:24.609
- Burning?
- Just kidding, Jerry. You'll be fine.

37:24.816 --> 37:28.115
Well, look, how long
am I gonna pee like this?

37:28.320 --> 37:29.981
Day or two.

37:30.622 --> 37:32.886
Man, someone's gonna pay.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.325
I told you to watch your back.

38:28.780 --> 38:30.270
You're here.

38:32.050 --> 38:33.745
You came back.

38:34.853 --> 38:36.115
That's right.

38:39.491 --> 38:40.924
Claire?

38:42.394 --> 38:43.861
Claire?

38:47.232 --> 38:48.221
Yes.

38:50.802 --> 38:52.167
I love you.

38:56.374 --> 38:58.274
I love you too, Mom.

39:09.588 --> 39:10.816
It's okay.

39:16.962 --> 39:18.691
It's a bathroom.

39:18.897 --> 39:20.489
Yeah, it's just a bathroom.

39:20.699 --> 39:23.691
Three stalls. Urinals.

39:24.369 --> 39:25.859
A couple of sinks.

39:27.005 --> 39:31.635
For a long time I had trouble
even coming in here.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.273
I used to dream about it.

39:38.883 --> 39:40.544
It was my nightmare.

39:42.087 --> 39:45.079
I was standing right here at the sink.

39:46.024 --> 39:47.855
Someone had just left.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.587
I was washing my face.

39:50.895 --> 39:54.797
Suddenly I feel a pain shooting
through my skull.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.902
And I realize that my head
has hit the porcelain...

40:00.005 --> 40:03.600
...as I'm crashing into the mirror.

40:05.377 --> 40:08.107
My mind is one step behind.

40:09.481 --> 40:11.210
Someone's attacking me.

40:14.152 --> 40:16.586
I end up on the ground here.

40:18.757 --> 40:20.224
And he's gone.

40:21.159 --> 40:26.096
So I crawl out,
and I try to stand up.

40:26.298 --> 40:29.495
And he's on me again.
And he's kicking.

40:29.701 --> 40:32.226
And punching. And kicking.

40:32.437 --> 40:35.133
And this sharp pain shoots...

40:35.340 --> 40:38.104
...through my hand as he stomps on it.

40:39.944 --> 40:41.878
I can still feel it.

40:42.847 --> 40:46.374
I'm lying there in the middle
of the floor.

40:48.653 --> 40:50.416
I can't stand.

40:50.822 --> 40:52.653
I can't talk.

40:52.857 --> 40:54.381
I just keep thinking:

40:56.461 --> 40:58.725
"Why didn't I do anything?"

41:00.799 --> 41:02.960
"Why didn't I fight back?"

41:07.138 --> 41:09.402
You cannot fight back.

41:11.643 --> 41:13.270
You cannot move.

41:23.221 --> 41:25.121
There's no window there.

41:31.796 --> 41:35.254
Only a bright light in that corner.

41:38.570 --> 41:40.470
Someone lies over there.

41:42.874 --> 41:44.068
You know him.

41:46.344 --> 41:47.333
A friend.

41:51.449 --> 41:52.746
He's dead.

41:56.454 --> 41:58.285
There are voices.

42:00.325 --> 42:02.190
A scream from over there.

42:06.865 --> 42:08.457
A chain.

42:12.771 --> 42:15.171
You hang from a chain right here.

42:16.975 --> 42:18.374
Right here.

42:21.813 --> 42:23.440
There is laughter.

42:31.656 --> 42:33.521
Fire over there.

42:36.494 --> 42:38.394
They heat their long blades.

42:39.264 --> 42:42.427
Hold... Holds it to you.

42:42.634 --> 42:44.192
It burns.

42:45.970 --> 42:47.767
You cannot breathe.

42:49.107 --> 42:51.268
It comes again, harder.

42:52.510 --> 42:53.670
Longer.

42:55.580 --> 42:57.207
You smell it.

42:57.549 --> 43:00.211
You smell your own flesh burning.

43:06.558 --> 43:07.820
Death.

43:09.794 --> 43:11.261
I wish for death.

43:13.998 --> 43:15.556
But my wife...

43:18.570 --> 43:19.935
My family...

43:22.674 --> 43:24.107
My family...

43:47.532 --> 43:49.432
- Hi.
- Hi, can I help you?

43:49.634 --> 43:51.226
I was hoping to catch Dr. McLucas.

43:51.436 --> 43:54.166
She left for the day.
Are you a patient?

43:54.372 --> 43:56.806
- Yes. Carol Hathaway.
- Is it an emergency?

43:57.008 --> 44:00.535
No, I just need to see her.
Can I make an appointment?

44:00.745 --> 44:02.440
Sure. What's it for?

44:02.647 --> 44:04.376
I'm going to have a baby.
