00:07.380 --> 00:08.960
Hey, Taylor.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.330
Nice game, Eric.

00:11.670 --> 00:13.380
Right now, I'm just a girl

00:13.380 --> 00:15.080
walking through
her high school quad.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.460
But pretty soon...

00:19.380 --> 00:22.080
How will I become
the first teenager on Mars?

00:24.330 --> 00:26.420
By winning
Imagination Gladiators.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.250
It's the state's
biggest competition

00:28.250 --> 00:29.540
for high school inventors.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.670
The winner wins
an all-expense-paid trip

00:31.670 --> 00:33.380
to NASA headquarters!

00:35.420 --> 00:37.500
Why are you walking
like that?

00:37.500 --> 00:41.040
- You're walking
like a doofus.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.420
I was practicing
my space walk.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.540
I'm on my way to see
Ms. Wilson.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.710
She decides who gets to go
to that science contest.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.540
And not to brag,
but I've got this.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.830
Besides from being
a super-good inventor,
I'm also her favorite.

00:53.830 --> 00:56.380
Yeah, everything you just said,
it's kinda braggy.

00:56.380 --> 00:59.000
I know.
I heard myself. Sorry.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.040
Uh...hi, Mr. Delorco.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.210
Are you subbing
for Ms. Wilson today?

01:09.210 --> 01:11.420
No. I'm taking over class
for good.

01:11.420 --> 01:14.540
!
- I share your dismay.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.500
Ms. Wilson hit a jackpot
on a lottery scratcher

01:17.500 --> 01:19.790
and decided to retire early.

01:19.790 --> 01:23.000
I haven't seen you
since you tried to convince me
you were Ellie Peters.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.460
What are you here to try
to convince me of today?

01:26.460 --> 01:28.710
What invention I should submit
for Imagination Gladiators.

01:28.710 --> 01:31.540
I was thinking about
my motion-powered
hair straightener.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.540
Oh! And I have a lobster
that also takes pictures--

01:33.540 --> 01:38.540
As vital as crustacean cameras
are, I'm leaning towards
sending Melissa Carter,

01:38.540 --> 01:41.540
who has been Melissa Carter
every time I've met her.

01:41.540 --> 01:44.540
Take a look at the project
she just brought in.

01:44.540 --> 01:49.380
- A skeleton.
- Not just a skeleton, Diaz.

01:49.380 --> 01:50.790
The future!

01:50.790 --> 01:53.580
Sternum.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.250
Clavicle.

01:55.250 --> 01:58.420
I can teach the bones of the
body while sitting at my desk.

01:58.420 --> 02:01.290
And even better,
now I don't have to
learn them all again.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.080
A SkeleTeacher.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.040
Good name.
Melissa can use that.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.080
Here to help.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.540
I haven't made my decision yet,

02:09.540 --> 02:11.540
but this is excellent work.

02:11.540 --> 02:15.420
Ms. Carter did something
every student should--

02:15.420 --> 02:17.750
she made the world
a better place.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.170
For me.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.210
I've got plenty
of other inventions.

02:21.210 --> 02:24.040
There's the Slushinator,
the Floor Finder,
the H2Whoa--

02:24.040 --> 02:26.120
As much as I'd like to
continue our chat, Diaz,

02:26.120 --> 02:28.580
I'm busy cleaning the lab
and drying the beakers--

02:28.580 --> 02:33.080
doing the mind-numbing tasks
that are the worst part
of my job.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.710
I have to find out
where Ms. Wilson bought
that lottery scratcher.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.040
Oh, no, you don't.
Mars is my dream.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.250
I'll find a way
to win this competition,
SkeleTeacher.

Good morning, ma'am,
Lewie and Beast
reporting for duty.

03:47.710 --> 03:50.750
- With Ethan out of town,

03:50.750 --> 03:53.620
we thought you might
need some help at work.

03:53.620 --> 03:56.540
Our résumé.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.710
"Frog wrestling promotors,
ninjas--"

03:59.710 --> 04:02.540
If anything,
we're overqualified.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.920
Look, I know you guys
mean well,

04:04.920 --> 04:07.580
but you always end up
causing more trouble
than actually helping.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.960
Also, "Can burb almost any song"
is not a job skill.

04:10.960 --> 04:15.210
Come on. It's our dream
to learn all the aspects
of the slushy industry.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.750
We made slushy, drank it,

04:17.750 --> 04:19.580
had it in our pants.

04:19.580 --> 04:21.880
The only thing left
is upper management.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.960
Yeah. We'll do anything--

04:23.960 --> 04:26.420
even the dirty jobs
no one else wants.

04:26.420 --> 04:28.750
- That position's
been filled.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.170
Meet...Slushbot.

04:33.580 --> 04:35.620
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

04:35.620 --> 04:40.000
I invented him to do
all the things around here
that I hate. Watch.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.710
Cool!
Can I ride him
around the store?

04:46.710 --> 04:48.750
You cannot. He's my assistant.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.880
And he's doing
what a good assistant does--
make my life easier.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.790
That's it!

04:54.790 --> 04:56.790
I know how to get in good
with Delorco.

04:56.790 --> 05:00.170
I'll program this guy
to do all the annoying classwork
he hates to do.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.750
He may not like me,
but he's going to love you.

05:02.750 --> 05:06.670
Slushbot, prepare to be
Schmoozebot!

05:06.670 --> 05:09.420
- Aaah!

05:09.420 --> 05:11.290
Is that spider back? I'll get
the spider-smashing shoe.

05:11.290 --> 05:14.210
No! Abuela just sent us
a huge check!

05:14.210 --> 05:17.120
She said it's to buy
that pool table we gave up
to visit her at Christmas.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.170
Okay. But first
can we talk about how
your "good" screams

05:19.170 --> 05:20.670
sound too much
like your "bad" screams?

05:20.670 --> 05:23.500
Well, there's only
going to be "good screams"
from now on--

05:23.500 --> 05:25.830
especially when I'm schooling
you on our new pool table.

05:25.830 --> 05:29.380
Aaah! That was a "good" scream
that came out bad.

05:29.380 --> 05:32.580
Hey, you know,
I saw a listing for
a 3-in-1 gaming table

05:32.580 --> 05:34.040
at the community board
at the store.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.040
It has pool, air hockey,
and, uh-- hmm--

05:36.040 --> 05:37.880
I don't know what
the third one was.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.750
There was an ad
for piano lessons over it.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.620
Ooh! Let's get it
and surprise the family!

05:41.620 --> 05:42.830
They'll be three times
as excited

05:42.830 --> 05:44.500
as the would be
just seeing a pool table.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.080
You know what?
Let's go right now,
get it before it's gone.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.790
Ooh, and don't tell anybody.

05:48.790 --> 05:52.040
So, which one of you
wants to help me
program my robot?

05:52.040 --> 05:54.250
Uh, no can do.

05:54.250 --> 05:57.790
We are headed to the...
hardware store.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.290
- Both of you.
- Oh, yeah.

05:59.290 --> 06:00.830
I always like
to have someone else there

06:00.830 --> 06:03.830
in case I want
a second opinion
on a hammer.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.080
But there's no one else
I can ask to help!

06:10.040 --> 06:11.540
Well, what do we have here,
Beast?

06:11.540 --> 06:14.670
Looks to me like
a desperate señorita.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.710
In need of help,
and all alone.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.580
All right.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.250
Guess I have
no other choice.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.670
You guys can help me.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.380
We offered, and you said no.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.500
Services are no longer
available.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.920
Not even to help me
program a robot?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.830
A robot?!

06:28.830 --> 06:31.250
Our services just
became available.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.500
All you have to do
is wear this and do
what I tell you.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.750
While you're moving,
I'll code it into the computer

06:37.750 --> 06:39.880
so the robot learns how
to do the same thing.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.920
So, who wants
to wear the shirt first?

06:41.920 --> 06:44.330
I do! I do.
I do, I do.

06:44.330 --> 06:46.750
Next time we wear
the same shirt,

06:46.750 --> 06:49.080
don't eat egg salad first.

06:49.080 --> 06:52.040
Well, your pointy hair
is no party.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.960
Now we are going
to show the robot

06:53.960 --> 06:55.920
how to dry the beakers.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.330
That sounds boring.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.710
Cleaning is boring.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.330
That's why we're teaching
him to do it

07:00.330 --> 07:01.880
so Delorco doesn't have to.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.920
How about we do it
with some flava!

07:03.920 --> 07:05.750
- Whoo whoo--
- To the left.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.330
- To the left.
- No, that's the right.

07:07.330 --> 07:08.710
No, that's the left.

07:08.710 --> 07:10.710
To the left. Whoo whoo!

07:10.710 --> 07:12.580
How about no.

07:12.580 --> 07:15.500
Remember, whatever moves
you guys do, he'll do.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.790
Now it's programmed
into the hard drive.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.420
Okay now it's time
for the most important task.

07:26.420 --> 07:29.460
We are going to be
cleaning Delorco's desk.

07:29.460 --> 07:31.670
Do this.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.500
Yes!

07:42.080 --> 07:44.380
Excellent!
All done.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.620
Thanks for your patience
and help, guys.

07:46.620 --> 07:49.750
Wow. There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.120
Yeah, it's weird
hearing it.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.920
You know, you both
impressed me today.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.000
You've earned the right
to be my assistants
at the Slushy Shack.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
- Yeah!
- All right!

07:59.000 --> 08:02.210
Okay, it's done.
Let's go get everyone.

08:02.210 --> 08:04.620
We could. Of course,

08:04.620 --> 08:06.290
the more people
that know about it,

08:06.290 --> 08:07.880
the more people fighting
for the first game.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.250
Ah, you're right.
I'll break.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.920
Looks like that one's
already broken.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.830
But the other one...

08:17.830 --> 08:19.830
is a broom.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.620
It's a used table.
Pool, not in top shape.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.420
We still have
two other games.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.080
- Mm-hmm.

08:47.420 --> 08:49.710
How many more
little plastic men
have to die

08:49.710 --> 08:50.830
before we admit
we made a mistake?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.920
That guy sold us
a piece of junk.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.040
We gotta get our money back.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.460
Let's pack this up.

08:59.420 --> 09:00.920
Aah! Ohh!

09:00.920 --> 09:03.040
- It's okay. He's friendly.
- Aaah!

09:03.040 --> 09:05.830
Matter of fact,
he'll get that for you.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.330
Hmm.

09:12.330 --> 09:15.540
Thank you.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.920
What is this, Diaz?

09:16.920 --> 09:18.670
My latest invention.

09:18.670 --> 09:20.960
I programmed him
to help out teachers.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.710
Can he escort unwanted students
out of the classroom?

09:23.710 --> 09:25.250
That would be helpful
right about now.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.960
I'll put that in
the next update.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.040
Let me ask you a question.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.540
Are you still drying
all those beakers yourself?

09:33.540 --> 09:35.460
Who else is going to do it?

09:35.460 --> 09:36.960
Glad you asked.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.000
Now, this is
a great invention.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.120
The kind you might choose
for Imagination Gladiators,
perhaps?

09:47.120 --> 09:50.830
Now, watch as
he tidies up your desk.

09:55.460 --> 09:57.290
!

09:57.290 --> 09:59.880
I'm sorry.
I don't know
what's happening.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.290
Take cover!

10:08.460 --> 10:11.170
SkeleTeacher:
Femur. Radius.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.290
Ulna. Scapula.

10:13.290 --> 10:14.960
Humerus-- Humerus--
Humerus--

10:14.960 --> 10:16.120
Ooh.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.330
Ribs.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.040
Nice going, Diaz.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.210
What part of a teacher's job

10:29.210 --> 10:31.830
did you think required
destroying a classroom?

10:33.120 --> 10:35.540
Destruction?

10:35.540 --> 10:38.120
There's only one explanation
for this.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.540
Make that two.
Lewis and Beast.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.290
All right, I think
we got this place
ready to open.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.000
Let's go over
our checklist.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.040
Put out cups, check.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.920
Put out straws, check.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.540
Wash hands--

10:56.040 --> 10:57.420
Uh-oh.

11:01.710 --> 11:03.380
- Eww.
- Eww.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.750
That was my fault.
Shouldn't have put that there.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.080
What did you two do?!

11:07.080 --> 11:09.210
It was an honest mistake.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.580
From now, no playing
in the frog tank
until after our shift.

11:12.580 --> 11:15.750
Someone taught my robot
wrestling moves,
and it wasn't me.

11:17.540 --> 11:21.960
Here comes
the Big Green Machine.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.120
Look out! You're gonna
get the Claw. Ha ha!

11:25.120 --> 11:26.500
Go, Claw!

11:30.000 --> 11:33.420
But we turned the robot off
before we started wrestling.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.920
I had already turned it off.
You turned it on!

11:35.920 --> 11:37.500
- Uh...
- W-We're sorry.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.170
Never touch
the power buttons
on my inventions.

11:40.170 --> 11:43.170
Bad things can happen.
They did happen.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.830
Because of you, I'll never get
to go to that science contest,

11:45.830 --> 11:47.210
not to mention Mars!

11:47.210 --> 11:49.000
You cost me a parade!

11:50.830 --> 11:53.620
That's it.
I'm done with you two.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.170
We're fired?

11:55.170 --> 11:56.880
Of course you're fired!

11:56.880 --> 11:58.960
But it doesn't stop there.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.170
I'm done done with you two.

12:02.170 --> 12:05.960
You guys always pull stuff,
and I always give you
second chances.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.580
Well, that's over.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.620
You're never getting
another one from me again.

12:11.670 --> 12:14.040
I-I guess we should leave.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.830
Nah, she's mad now.
Just give her time--

12:16.830 --> 12:20.580
I've got a fighting robot,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.250
You know, I'm actually
glad this happened,

12:26.250 --> 12:28.500
because you are gonna learn
a valuable lesson

12:28.500 --> 12:31.460
- about not getting
taken advantage of.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.170
Hey, us again.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.210
So, it turns out--

12:34.210 --> 12:36.750
The ad said "as is."

12:40.210 --> 12:42.210
So now what?

12:42.210 --> 12:44.170
I gotta go back at him.
This guy needs
some tough talk.

12:44.170 --> 12:47.170
Tough talk. Good lesson. Go.

12:47.170 --> 12:50.330
First you ring the bell.
That much I know.

12:50.330 --> 12:53.080
Hang on. I'm a little
out of practice being the heavy.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.290
You might have noticed
most punishments come
from your mother.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.620
We have a system:
she lays down the law,

12:58.620 --> 13:01.420
I'm the one who
stands behind her
looking disappointed.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.120
Yeah, I recognize that.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.250
Is this
a "Gimme back
my money" face?

13:08.250 --> 13:10.290
No, that's a "door slam" face.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.290
Awright, I just gotta get
this muscle back in shape again.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.830
- We'll come back.
- Yeah. Totally.

13:15.830 --> 13:18.170
Or we put Mom on speakerphone.

13:20.670 --> 13:23.540
So, we messed up,
and Harley's mad.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.540
But it's not like
we haven't been in
this situation before.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.210
All the time.

13:28.210 --> 13:31.290
But we're sorry,
and she's still mad.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.170
Maybe we're not as cute
as we used to be.

13:33.170 --> 13:34.880
Don't talk crazy.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.040
Saying we're sorry
isn't enough this time.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.460
To win her back,
we have to pull out
all the stops.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.880
Happy morning!

13:44.880 --> 13:46.830
Both:
It's a robot cake!

13:53.460 --> 13:54.880
Ohh--

14:12.710 --> 14:15.750
I've never
seen Harley this mad.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.330
She's always forgiven us
when we messed up before.

14:18.330 --> 14:20.920
But what if she stays mad
at us forever?

14:20.920 --> 14:22.790
That would be terrible.

14:22.790 --> 14:25.420
I've already got a line
on a dapper quinceañera suit.

14:25.420 --> 14:30.170
I feel awful we ruined her
chance to go to that contest.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.750
I don't know why
she didn't like
any of these things.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.170
There's only one way
to fix this.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.380
We cost her a spot
in that competition,

14:38.380 --> 14:40.710
we have to find a way
to get it back.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.170
What are you doing?

14:43.170 --> 14:45.670
Oh. Putting bacon on cake.

14:45.670 --> 14:47.080
I call it cakon.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.330
Mmm!

14:48.330 --> 14:51.120
Minds like this
can fix anything.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.500
Oh. Sorry I woke you
from your nap, Mrs. Delorco,

14:57.500 --> 14:59.920
but I'm calling
from Finnigan's Flowers.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.210
Your son just won
a free bouquet.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.170
What kind of flowers
does he like?

15:03.170 --> 15:06.120
No one ever
sent him flowers before...

15:06.120 --> 15:08.080
and he's allergic? Ohh!

15:08.080 --> 15:10.790
Okay, fine.
Forget I called. Bye.

15:10.790 --> 15:14.290
No offense, but your prank
phone call skills? Not good.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.460
I'm trying to find something
Delorco likes

15:16.460 --> 15:18.420
so I can get back
on his good side.

15:18.420 --> 15:21.420
Slushbot became Schmoozebot
and then nearly Killbot.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.250
You know, I've always
worried about robots
trying to take over the planet.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.420
Oh no. He heard me,
didn't he?

15:27.420 --> 15:30.540
Don't worry. He's harmless.
I reprogrammed him.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.330
Arrgh! Lewis and Beast!

15:37.330 --> 15:39.290
I guess I still have
some work to do.

15:39.290 --> 15:43.290
Harley, I found out
what you did.
Now go to your room!

15:44.250 --> 15:45.920
Wait. We're not at home.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.500
Go to my office!

15:47.500 --> 15:49.170
No, I have to go in there.

15:49.170 --> 15:50.830
Your mother makes this look
so easy.

15:50.830 --> 15:54.460
Pretty weak.
Wasn't buying it
for a second.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.880
What are you doing here,
anyway? I thought you'd
be at school.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.250
What do you mean?
I'm working.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.540
- Ohh.

16:02.540 --> 16:05.290
That might explain
your lack of customers.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.460
Lewis and Beast said
they were going to your school,

16:07.460 --> 16:08.920
and then they took
a bunch of your inventions.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.620
So I figured you'd be there too

16:10.620 --> 16:12.250
since they were going
to see your teacher.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.750
What? Lewie and Beast
are going to see Delorco?

16:14.750 --> 16:17.620
That's even more dangerous
than Killbot!

16:22.330 --> 16:25.380
This is when
we turn it all around
for Harley.

16:25.380 --> 16:28.080
Once her teacher
sees how awesome
her inventions are,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.420
he'll pick one of them
for that competition.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.460
I know I would.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.290
Okay, you cannot wear that.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.330
Why not? You get
to wear glasses.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.330
I wear glasses.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.040
Aaah!

16:42.040 --> 16:45.380
You coulda said something
before the glue dried.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.040
Now let's do this
just like we practiced.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.830
Four to five minutes
for each piece.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.710
We don't want to rush
through the details.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.960
I'm good. I know these things
backwards and forwards by now.

16:56.670 --> 17:00.460
This vaccum runs on
a nickel-metal
hydride battery.

17:00.460 --> 17:04.210
It features an omnidirectional
infrared sensor.

17:04.210 --> 17:06.420
Brushes rotating
in opposite directions

17:06.420 --> 17:08.580
enables it
to pick up almost anything.

17:08.580 --> 17:10.830
The vaccum directs
the airflow

17:10.830 --> 17:16.580
through a tiny opening
to increase its speed
and collect dust.

17:16.580 --> 17:19.620
Should I go into
the composition
of the mechanical bumper?

17:19.620 --> 17:23.000
No. Save that gold
for Delorco.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.540
And when we talk about this,

17:25.540 --> 17:28.580
throw in that she made it
as something nice for Mom.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.080
Teachers are suckers
for that kind of stuff.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.750
Okay, you're not good
at acting mad,

17:34.750 --> 17:36.710
so I'm going to make sure
you actually are mad.

17:36.710 --> 17:39.540
I made a list of
all the bad things
us kids have done

17:39.540 --> 17:40.750
that you don't know about.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.210
What don't I know about?

17:42.210 --> 17:44.040
Plenty.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.170
Seven kids means seven times
the bad stuff that happens
behind your back.

17:47.170 --> 17:50.210
Remember when Rachel
said she was visiting
Bookchester College?

17:50.210 --> 17:52.580
She actually went
to a music festival.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.000
I mean, come on, Dad.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.420
Does that even sound
like a real college,
"Bookchester"?

17:58.170 --> 18:00.380
Left your baseball cards
out in the rain...

18:00.380 --> 18:02.540
Ordered Snoozleberries 8
on pay-for-view..

18:02.540 --> 18:04.830
Accidentally flushed your
cell phone down the toilet...

18:04.830 --> 18:06.750
Buried her bad report card
in the yard...

18:06.750 --> 18:09.460
Ruined your vegetable garden
burying her bad report card
in the yard...

18:09.460 --> 18:12.170
Ate your saved burrito...
ate your saved
pepperoni pizza...

18:12.170 --> 18:14.170
Cookies...
Ice cream sandwich...

18:14.170 --> 18:16.210
Piece of birthday cake
with your name on it...

18:16.210 --> 18:19.040
And that's why
the cash register drawer
was full of salami.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.960
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.960
Everyone knows I'm not good
at keeping a secret,

18:23.960 --> 18:25.920
so they don't tell me
the really bad stuff.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.250
I am so mad right now.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.210
Okay, great, let's go!

18:31.210 --> 18:33.420
And it's rush hour,
so traffic will be awful.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.790
That'll keep this
rage party going.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.250
Aah!

18:42.250 --> 18:43.540
Didn't mean to scare you.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.580
We're Harley Diaz's brothers.

18:45.580 --> 18:48.080
Diaz. Of course.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.460
Don't you kids know how
to make an appointment?

18:50.460 --> 18:52.670
I'm Lewie.
This is Beast.

18:52.670 --> 18:54.750
Now sit back, relax.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.080
We'd like to tell you all about
our sister's inventions.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.250
Not interested.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.670
What about now

19:04.250 --> 19:07.290
We just need 20 to 27 minutes
of your time,

19:07.290 --> 19:09.580
depending on
the question and answer
session at the end.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.960
- I'll give you one minute.
- But we need--

19:10.960 --> 19:12.250
Make that 30 seconds.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.170
Okay. We can
work with that.

19:14.170 --> 19:17.330
This one,
programmable
in three or more axes,

19:17.330 --> 19:19.670
jump rope with sisters,
heartwarming.

19:19.670 --> 19:24.460
MegaMagnet. Flip the switch,
reverse polarity, duck!

19:24.460 --> 19:26.040
Voice-controlled vacuum.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.500
Infrared sensor.
Plays music.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.330
Dance while you clean.
Whoo whoo!

19:30.330 --> 19:32.960
High pressure PVC,
Mother's Day gift,
toilet paper.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.830
Sniff-sniff.
Oh, I'm tearing up.

19:34.830 --> 19:37.670
The end. Questions?
Sorry, we're out of time.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.880
Didn't get a lot of that,

19:39.880 --> 19:42.210
but I got to admit,

19:42.210 --> 19:44.710
these are pretty intriguing,

19:44.710 --> 19:47.710
for someone of any age,
let alone your sister.

19:47.710 --> 19:50.710
And she uses only
the finest materials.

19:50.710 --> 19:53.080
This is quilted. Mmm.

19:56.170 --> 19:57.920
He's loading it.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.620
Stop!

20:15.830 --> 20:17.000
Cranium.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.710
What happened?!
I turned it off!

20:26.710 --> 20:28.290
We never turned it on!

20:28.290 --> 20:30.670
You told us not to touch
the power button!

20:30.670 --> 20:32.290
Now you decide
to listen to me.

20:34.290 --> 20:35.710
Ohh!

20:37.960 --> 20:40.620
And that dent
you thought you got
in the parking lot,

20:40.620 --> 20:43.710
Lewie and Beast made it
playing a game called
Dent Dad's Car.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.170
That clinched
Lewie's win.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.250
- That cost me 500 bucks!
- Use that.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.880
Listen up, you jerk.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.830
You sold us
a piece of gargage.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.710
No, you know what?
"Jerk" is too nice for you.

20:55.710 --> 20:58.000
You are dirt.
No, you're filth.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.670
And I know filth
because I scrape it

20:59.670 --> 21:01.500
off the bottom of boats
every day.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.670
Now you better
give us back our money

21:03.670 --> 21:05.290
before I start scrapin' you!

21:05.290 --> 21:07.920
I'm so sorry!

21:07.920 --> 21:09.880
I can't give you
your money!

21:09.880 --> 21:13.000
I already sent it
to my mother for
her back surgery.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.540
I didn't know what else to do!

21:15.540 --> 21:17.580
It was all I had to sell!

21:17.580 --> 21:21.670
And now I don't even have
a gaming table to cheer me up.

21:21.670 --> 21:25.000
Hey it's okay. It's okay.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.710
You know what, here,
ah...

21:27.710 --> 21:29.170
here's 20 bucks.

21:29.170 --> 21:31.080
Go get something nice
for yourself.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.960
And you know what, here.
Here's 50 for your mother.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.290
You're a very kind person.

21:36.290 --> 21:39.000
Other than all that horrible
stuff you just said about me.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.960
So I guess I failed.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.670
Please. I would have done
the same thing.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.080
What are we going to do?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.750
Now we have nothing
for the game room.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.750
Next time Abuela visits,
she's going to ask us

21:51.750 --> 21:53.750
what happened to the money
she sent.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.620
Look, your sister's
an inventor.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.420
It's only a matter of time
before she invents us
a better gaming table.

21:58.420 --> 21:59.750
She's already done it
with our table table.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.540
Ooh! I know!
We put it back together

22:02.540 --> 22:03.880
and let Lewie and Beast
play with it.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.210
After that, no one will question
why it's broken.

22:06.210 --> 22:07.880
And I won't feel so guilty
pinning it on the boys

22:07.880 --> 22:10.210
because I found out about
the salami in the register.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
It's okay.
You can come out now.

22:17.170 --> 22:21.670
I know I'm no longer
in the running for
Imagination Gladiators.

22:21.670 --> 22:25.380
But if I clean this up,
will you maybe
not take me to court?

22:25.380 --> 22:26.750
Don't worry, Diaz.

22:26.750 --> 22:29.330
As much as it pains me
to admit it,

22:29.330 --> 22:31.920
you're the one
who most deserves
to go to that contest.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.120
Any one of these
beats Ms. Carter's
skeleton.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.750
- You heard me.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.750
And you should
thank your brothers,

22:39.750 --> 22:42.460
They really pitched
your inventions well.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.460
- Yeah.

22:44.460 --> 22:47.420
My brothers?
These two?

22:47.420 --> 22:49.420
And he only gave us
30 seconds.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.420
We had way more stuff
to say.

22:51.420 --> 22:54.380
How did you know
anything about
my inventions?

22:54.380 --> 22:58.170
We stayed up all night
researching and practicing.

22:58.170 --> 23:01.170
We had to get you back
into that contest.

23:01.170 --> 23:04.830
You researched and practiced?

23:04.830 --> 23:07.710
Wow. There's a sentence
I never thought I would say.

23:07.710 --> 23:09.790
It's been a weird
few days.

23:12.330 --> 23:15.790
Seems like every subsequent Diaz
is an improvement.

23:15.790 --> 23:18.460
I can't wait to meet
your little sister.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.920
She must be
really special.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.500
Oh, yeah. She's...
really something.

23:28.330 --> 23:31.920
Guys, because of
everything you did for me,

23:31.920 --> 23:34.540
I'm giving you
what you've always wanted.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.080
A job at the Slushy Shack!

23:36.080 --> 23:37.790
- Cool!
- All right!

23:42.420 --> 23:44.120
What happened?
Where is everything?

23:44.120 --> 23:45.670
We've been robbed.
