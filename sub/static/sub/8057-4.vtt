Mr. Haverford, on the morning of your crash

00:02.082 --> 00:03.681
- were you alone in your car?
- Yes.

00:03.801 --> 00:05.121
Your Honor, this was an accident.

00:05.122 --> 00:07.846
Plain and simple. I don't want to put
words in your mouth but...

00:11.992 --> 00:12.868

What's with the get-up?

01:33.563 --> 01:35.523
I just got back from
that dude ranch with Ricky.

01:35.558 --> 01:37.638
It was really fun.
He bought this for me as a gift.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.769
A cowboy hat from your cowboyfriend.

01:39.803 --> 01:41.403
Oh, that makes it sound like he's a cow.

Okay, everyone.

have chlamydia.

01:50.530 --> 01:51.814
Whoo!

01:51.832 --> 01:54.033
Seniors in Pawnee have
a lot of time on their hands,

01:54.084 --> 01:55.584
and what they're doing with that time

01:55.619 --> 01:57.953
is going at it hard,
old people-style.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.172
A lot of them haven't
had proper sex education,

02:00.207 --> 02:03.092
and as a result,
STDs are having a field day.

02:03.126 --> 02:05.795
It's amazing what a few old guys can do

and a lot of crabs.

02:08.348 --> 02:09.882
Okay, sex avengers,

02:09.933 --> 02:12.134
these old fogies
are very set in their ways.

02:12.168 --> 02:14.020
They're hopped up
on E.D. medication

02:14.054 --> 02:15.605
and they got nothing to lose,

02:15.606 --> 02:16.806
'cause they're close to death.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.141
Also, seniors can be pretty ornery.

Uh, actually, I think
it's pronounced "horny."

02:21.845 --> 02:24.513
I have an idea. Let's pretend
that we're old people,

02:24.531 --> 02:26.982
and we can ask Ann our grossest,

02:27.016 --> 02:28.818
most perverted sex questions.

02:28.852 --> 02:30.486
I'll start.
I'm an old lady,

02:36.660 --> 02:38.661

the older you get?

02:42.883 --> 02:43.899
I don't think so, no.

Where can I get lube
that is healthy to eat?

Choo choo!

02:55.145 --> 02:56.950
You should never eat lube,

02:56.951 --> 02:58.431
you need to see a doctor immediately,

02:58.482 --> 03:00.683

are sexually active?

Does anyone know what we risk

04:47.874 --> 04:49.925
when we have unprotected sex?

04:49.960 --> 04:51.510
- Heart attack.
- Falling in love.

04:53.180 --> 04:55.181
Yes, but the truth is,

04:55.215 --> 04:56.765
the greatest risk you face

04:56.800 --> 04:58.717
is sexually transmitted diseases.

having sex with each other?

them is to use protection.

"sterilization techniques."

Yeah, I have a new idea.

garbage from your system.

you do on those screens,

07:59.246 --> 08:01.981
and let the words just
float away into the fresh air,

- and then we will be done.
- Okay, worth a shot.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.403

Facebook, Twitter,

08:07.454 --> 08:08.737
tumblr, and Instagram.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.739
Sometimes I like to throw in Linkedln,

08:10.790 --> 08:12.958
for the professional shorties.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.660
See?
That was easy.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.161
Then I like to go on reddit.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.379

- Yeah.

I got it at the dude ranch
with my boyfriend.

- You like it?
- It's not my favorite shirt,

08:27.424 --> 08:30.926
but it is my least favorite shirt.

Perd, we strongly believe

08:32.544 --> 08:36.048
in teaching and practicing abstinence.

08:36.066 --> 08:39.183

from time to time,

08:39.217 --> 08:40.552

08:40.570 --> 08:43.522
You have to bury them
way down deep inside.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.275
You have to say, "Get out
of here, you crazy urges!

08:46.326 --> 08:48.086
You are not welcome
in this brain of mine!"

08:48.087 --> 08:49.695
There are some statistics

08:49.729 --> 08:51.247
that I'd like to share with you now,

08:51.281 --> 08:52.915
and they are numbers.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.000
Some 85% of Pawnee residents

08:55.035 --> 08:57.736
support
abstinence-only education.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.089
And the other 15% are perverts.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.740
- J.K., you guys.
- [Laughs]

09:01.758 --> 09:04.627
And 100% of Pawneeans
are "perd-verts."

09:04.678 --> 09:06.118
- [Laughs]
- That's the name I call

09:06.119 --> 09:07.046
fans of this show

09:07.080 --> 09:09.848
based on the fact that my name is Perd.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.603
We'll see you
after the break, perd-verts.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.589
[Laughs]

09:12.590 --> 09:14.470
Look, we need an emergency
task force meeting.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.554
What do we do?

09:15.588 --> 09:16.972
Objective studies have shown

09:17.023 --> 09:19.275
that abstinence-only
education doesn't work.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.592
People still have sex.

09:20.610 --> 09:22.130
They don't know how to use protection,

09:22.131 --> 09:23.696
so the disease keeps spreading.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.564
We need to give people
practical knowledge.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.816
Ann Perkins, your expertise is thrilling,

09:27.867 --> 09:30.653
and frankly, almost arousing,

09:30.704 --> 09:32.037
but the law is the law.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.605
Well, you're on city council now.

09:33.623 --> 09:35.908
- Change the law.
- The people support this.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.276
I couldn't fight those numbers
even if I wanted to.

09:38.295 --> 09:39.710
It's political suicide.

09:39.711 --> 09:41.911
So we're just gonna do
the thing we know doesn't work?

09:41.912 --> 09:43.752
- Great plan.
- There's no other option, Ann.

09:43.753 --> 09:44.633
Put away your sex toys

09:44.634 --> 09:46.074
and play with them on your own time.

09:46.075 --> 09:48.120
- [Sighs]
- I did eat all the bananas,

09:48.138 --> 09:50.756
so you can't play with those.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.525
Oh, hey, nice work on the jobs research.

He's not doing anything.

09:59.195 --> 09:59.982
That's the point.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.234
This morning he got in, sat down in there,

10:02.268 --> 10:05.437
and has been staring
straight ahead, doing nothing.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.189
- He's a robot.
- He's not a robot.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.658
He's just thinking.
He's got a lot on his mind.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.977
Yeah, like, "One, one, zero, one.

10:11.995 --> 10:13.529
Must eat babies for fuel."

10:13.580 --> 10:14.997
[Scoffs] Why would a robot

10:15.031 --> 10:16.915
need to consume organic matter?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.367
Sorry.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.819
You know what,
they probably put a TV in there,

10:20.837 --> 10:24.289
and he's watching old speeches
to bone up or something.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.258
Let's go see.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.710
Congressman,

10:27.761 --> 10:30.629
here is the briefing packet
for our strategy meeting later.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.665
Excellent, thank you.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.135
Anything else I can do for you?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.837
No, sir.
All systems are operational.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.607
Great. Stay cool.
Hot one out there today.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.978
Thank you, congressman.

Mankind's greatest invention/

10:52.152 --> 10:53.402

10:53.453 --> 10:55.404
Take Ray J, for example.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.455
We all know he's a singer,
he's Brandy's brother,

10:57.456 --> 10:58.856
and he was in that classic sex tape

10:58.858 --> 11:00.242
with Kim Kardashian,

11:00.293 --> 11:03.078
but did you also know
he's Snoop Dogg's cousin

11:03.129 --> 11:06.248
and he was in the '96
Tim Burton movie <i>Mars Attacks?</i>

11:06.299 --> 11:08.333
Suddenly, you're on the <i>Mars Attacks</i> page.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.086
I love GChat.
You can talk to anybody.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.872
I hit up Brad. Pitt.
It wasn't the actor.

11:13.890 --> 11:17.476
It's actually a guy named Brad
that's a teacher in Pittsburgh.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.573

11:19.574 --> 11:21.814
We don't have a lot in common,
but we chat quite a bit.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.316
"Emoji" are little cartoons
you text instead of words.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.735
Instead of saying,
"What up, boo?"

11:25.736 --> 11:27.936
You can type "What up,"
and then a cute, little ghost,

11:27.937 --> 11:28.937
'cause
that means "boo."

11:28.988 --> 11:30.308
There's even a little Indian guy,

11:30.309 --> 11:32.274
but he has a turban on,
which I think is racist,

11:32.325 --> 11:34.693
but the Asian guy
also has a racist hat on,

11:34.727 --> 11:35.687
and it's like, "Hold up,

11:35.688 --> 11:37.168
didn't Japanese people
invent this?"

11:37.169 --> 11:39.031

There are a million of 'em,

11:39.065 --> 11:40.732

11:40.750 --> 11:43.636

called "Nacho average podcast,"

11:43.637 --> 11:45.237
where we rate different kinds of nachos.

11:45.255 --> 11:47.172
- It seems like...
- Okay, that's enough!

11:47.207 --> 11:48.406
No more talking.

11:48.425 --> 11:50.345
But you told me
to get it all out of my system.

11:50.346 --> 11:52.544
I had no idea how much
you had in your system.

11:52.578 --> 11:53.762
This is a real problem, tom.

I'm proud of you,

12:13.900 --> 12:16.285

that we're verging on

12:16.319 --> 12:19.037
what I call "feelings territory,"

12:19.072 --> 12:21.240
so let's stare at the fire in silence.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.275

12:25.128 --> 12:26.378

12:26.412 --> 12:29.882

12:30.967 --> 12:32.251
Perfect.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.421
Here's our educational pamphlet.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.557
I recommend you start reading
at chapter three.

"Chapter three.

16:46.479 --> 16:48.330
That's great.
Good.

16:48.364 --> 16:50.866
Cool beans.

16:50.917 --> 16:53.919
See you guys later.

16:55.254 --> 16:58.623
God, I love him.
He's the best.

16:58.657 --> 17:01.326
I'm sorry I crashed your car.

17:01.344 --> 17:03.462
Please forgive me, Ron.
Please, Ron?

17:03.496 --> 17:05.847
Please?

17:05.882 --> 17:07.722
What are you doing?
Are you going to kill me?

17:07.723 --> 17:11.185
Why do you need to be
constantly distracted, tom?

17:13.306 --> 17:14.522
The truth is

17:14.557 --> 17:16.474
I spend a lot of time looking at screens

17:16.509 --> 17:17.943
because recently,

17:17.977 --> 17:19.394
a lot of the stuff in my real life

17:19.444 --> 17:20.862
isn't going that great.

17:20.896 --> 17:23.949
So I'd rather play Doodle Jump
then think about that.

17:23.983 --> 17:26.952
Okay?
I'm sorry, I really am.

17:28.186 --> 17:29.538
Go sit in your office

17:29.572 --> 17:32.791
while I consider whether
to turn you in to the judge.

17:32.825 --> 17:35.961
And while you're there,
neither doodle nor jump.

17:40.633 --> 17:44.369
Hey. I just wanted
to come lend my support.

17:44.387 --> 17:45.827
What are you going to say out there?

17:45.828 --> 17:48.006
I don't know.
I got censured, it's a big deal.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.926
Well, if you ask me,
you were elected to lead

17:50.977 --> 17:52.344
and not to follow.

17:52.378 --> 17:54.646
Which is probably what I should've said

17:54.680 --> 17:56.014
instead of what I did say.

17:56.048 --> 17:57.682
I feel terrible about what I said too.

17:57.716 --> 17:59.217
No, you were right.

17:59.235 --> 18:01.386
I know, but I still feel terrible.

18:01.404 --> 18:02.737
I'm sorry, continue.

18:02.772 --> 18:05.023
I kind of lost myself
in this relationship.

18:05.057 --> 18:07.225
I bought a lasso online, Leslie.

18:07.243 --> 18:08.326
Yikes.

18:08.361 --> 18:10.695
I turned all my jeans into Daisy Dukes.

18:10.729 --> 18:12.831
My personality kinda gets swept up

18:12.865 --> 18:16.067
in whatever guy I'm dating,
and I want to change that.

18:16.085 --> 18:17.569
I broke it off with Ricky.

18:17.587 --> 18:19.067
Well, that's good, but I'll tell you,

18:19.071 --> 18:21.540
he'll never lasso another heifer

18:21.574 --> 18:25.126
as fine as you, Annie Oakley.

18:25.178 --> 18:27.412
The story of that commercial break is

18:27.446 --> 18:28.547
it's over.

18:28.581 --> 18:31.183
Leslie, what exactly does "censure" mean?

18:31.217 --> 18:33.101
It means that I have been
formally disciplined

18:33.135 --> 18:34.636
for breaking the law.

18:34.687 --> 18:37.922
Well, you know what they say,
"You break it, you buy it."

18:37.940 --> 18:39.407
That doesn't really apply here.

18:39.442 --> 18:41.443
Tell that to the folks at Pier 1,

18:41.477 --> 18:44.762
an establishment
I'm no longer allowed inside.

18:44.780 --> 18:46.264
Perd, I'd like to apologize.

18:46.282 --> 18:47.566
Thank you.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.435
Apologize for the antiquated
laws in this city.

18:50.453 --> 18:53.154
States that teach
abstinence-only

18:53.206 --> 18:55.740
have the highest rates
of teen pregnancy and STDs.

18:55.774 --> 18:57.659
To continue this policy is insane.

18:57.710 --> 19:01.112
Look, we all want the same thing, right?

19:01.130 --> 19:04.249
We want fewer unwanted
pregnancies and fewer STDs.

19:04.283 --> 19:06.618
Why don't we use
every weapon that we have?

19:06.636 --> 19:08.953
I know that most of you
don't agree with me on this,

19:08.971 --> 19:12.140
but I'm going to fight very hard
to change your minds,

19:12.174 --> 19:14.759
and until then, I will take this censure,

19:14.793 --> 19:18.796
and I will wear it proudly,
like a badge of honor.

19:18.814 --> 19:20.315
Wow, strong words from a woman

19:20.349 --> 19:23.018
who is trying to pin
a piece of paper to her blazer.

19:23.069 --> 19:26.471
Next up on the program,
we hear from you, our fans,

19:26.489 --> 19:29.574
in our new segment,
"Are you there, perd-verts?

19:29.609 --> 19:32.777
It's me, Perd,
hosting a new segment."

19:32.811 --> 19:36.314
[Groans] I'm so bored.

19:36.332 --> 19:37.582
I have something for you, son.

19:37.617 --> 19:39.534
- My iPhone?
- No.

19:39.585 --> 19:41.486
I am giving you
a non-electronic book

19:41.504 --> 19:42.704
made of paper from a tree.

19:42.755 --> 19:47.158
It is called
<i>Auto Repair Manual: 1982.</i>

19:47.176 --> 19:49.160
You will read this book
from cover to cover,

19:49.178 --> 19:52.430
then you will assist me in
repairing the damage to my car.

19:52.465 --> 19:54.432
I will not report you to the judge,

19:54.467 --> 19:57.001
but if you slip up again,
you will have much more to fear

19:57.019 --> 19:59.521
than some feeble
government employee in a robe.

19:59.555 --> 20:01.005
- Thanks.
- Two more things.

20:01.023 --> 20:02.307
When you do get your phone back,

20:02.341 --> 20:03.769
you will not stare at it

20:03.770 --> 20:05.610
when you're talking
with another human being.

20:05.645 --> 20:07.812
Look a man in the eye
when you speak with him.

20:07.846 --> 20:09.781
And second, if you ever need

20:09.815 --> 20:13.401
to discuss your problems with someone...

20:13.452 --> 20:16.020
find Leslie.
She lives for that crap.

20:16.038 --> 20:19.190
Get to work.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.660
They're killing me in the press.

20:21.694 --> 20:24.462
The <i>Pawnee Sun</i>
is calling me "Loose-ly Grope."

20:24.497 --> 20:26.030
But you know what?
I don't even care.

20:26.048 --> 20:27.288
I'm gonna kick all their asses!

20:27.289 --> 20:28.550
I am so fired up!

20:28.584 --> 20:30.835
I'm gonna go right now
and drink, like, 1,000 Red Bulls

20:30.869 --> 20:33.505
so I can draft a new bill
to undo abstinence-only.

20:33.539 --> 20:35.757
Man, you are just a machine.

20:35.808 --> 20:36.969
Get stuff done.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.210
Hey, why don't you send it to me
when you have a draft?

20:39.211 --> 20:40.931
- I'll try to help.
- You're the greatest.

20:40.965 --> 20:43.045
But you're gonna have
to take out a lot of cursing,

20:43.046 --> 20:44.606
'cause like I said, I am very fired up.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.868
Well, you go get 'em.
I love you.

20:46.902 --> 20:49.154
I love you too.
What are you wearing?

20:49.188 --> 20:50.855
I can't do that right now.

20:50.889 --> 20:51.873
[Laughs]

20:51.993 --> 20:58.889

20:59.604 --> 21:03.092
- Yo, you ready to go?
- Why, yes, I am, April!

21:03.335 --> 21:05.001
Let's go now!

21:05.003 --> 21:06.002
What's wrong with you?

21:06.004 --> 21:08.013
[Fake laugh] Wonderful!

21:08.133 --> 21:09.588
Hey, be careful out there.

21:09.708 --> 21:11.975
Traffic is nuts on the streets and roads.

21:11.977 --> 21:14.511
Oh, no!
They got you!

21:14.513 --> 21:16.096
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ah, ha, ha.

21:16.098 --> 21:17.751
Terrific!
Hey, I'm hungry.

21:17.847 --> 21:20.430
Let's go eat some batteries...
I mean, human food.

21:20.432 --> 21:21.715
Hey, uh, batteries...

21:21.717 --> 21:23.684
I mean, human food sounds good to me.

21:23.686 --> 21:24.781
Wonderful.

21:27.172 --> 21:29.356
- Let's go.
- [Laughs]
