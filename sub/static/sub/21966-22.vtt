WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.625
( gentle theme playing )

00:06.709 --> 00:08.166
( camera shutter snaps )

00:08.208 --> 00:10.500
KADE:

00:08.208 --> 00:10.500
Can we please get a move on?

00:10.542 --> 00:12.166
I'd like to get out

00:10.542 --> 00:12.166
of Blossom Vale

00:12.208 --> 00:13.750
sometime this century.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.542
You go ahead, Kade.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.542
We'll catch up.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.500
Really, we don't need

00:15.583 --> 00:17.500
a babysitter.

00:17.542 --> 00:20.166
Yeah, we have a four-ton

00:17.542 --> 00:20.166
Bot to protect us.

00:20.208 --> 00:22.417
And he won't eat our snacks.

00:22.458 --> 00:25.208
This was Dad's idea, okay?

00:22.458 --> 00:25.208
Not mine.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.667
If Graham wasn't so busy,

00:25.250 --> 00:27.667
he'd be Boulder's driver,

00:27.709 --> 00:29.125
and I'd be on a date

00:27.709 --> 00:29.125
with Hayley.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.542
BOULDER:

00:29.166 --> 00:30.542
Shh.

00:30.583 --> 00:33.750
Bird-watching is supposed

00:30.583 --> 00:33.750
to be a quiet activity.

00:33.792 --> 00:35.709
More like tree-watching.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.291
Only Boulder could

00:35.750 --> 00:37.291
enjoy a pastime

00:37.333 --> 00:39.250
that even humans

00:37.333 --> 00:39.250
know is boring.

00:39.291 --> 00:42.500
I find the variety and beauty

00:39.291 --> 00:42.500
of earth birds inspiring.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.583
Cybertron had nothing like this.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.458
CODY:

00:44.625 --> 00:46.458
What kind of bird

00:44.625 --> 00:46.458
is it, Boulder?

00:46.500 --> 00:49.250
BOULDER:

00:46.500 --> 00:49.250
I think it's

00:46.500 --> 00:49.250
a Red-headed Cuckoo.

00:49.291 --> 00:52.875
Why are you looking at me

00:49.291 --> 00:52.875
when you say that?

00:52.917 --> 00:54.375
Okay, let's go.

00:54.417 --> 00:56.417
Finally!

00:54.417 --> 00:56.417
Cody, Frankie, let's--

00:56.458 --> 00:57.667
( sighs )

00:57.709 --> 01:00.083
Where are they?

00:57.709 --> 01:00.083
FRANKIE: Up here!

01:02.834 --> 01:06.583
CODY:

01:02.834 --> 01:06.583
We just want to get

01:02.834 --> 01:06.583
a high shot of the whole grove.

01:06.625 --> 01:10.750
BOULDER:

01:06.625 --> 01:10.750
Oh. Woodpeckers, with babies.

01:10.792 --> 01:12.709
Ugh, babies.

01:12.750 --> 01:13.917
Huh? Where?

01:13.959 --> 01:17.208
I can't see

01:13.959 --> 01:17.208
them from here.

01:17.250 --> 01:20.166
Hey, guys, climb down from

01:17.250 --> 01:20.166
there! It doesn't look safe.

01:20.208 --> 01:22.583
CODY:

01:20.208 --> 01:22.583
Don't worry, Kade, we're fine!

01:22.625 --> 01:25.291
No!

01:22.625 --> 01:25.291

01:27.291 --> 01:30.166

What if you'd gotten hurt?!

02:30.250 --> 02:31.750
You know what Dad

02:30.250 --> 02:31.750
would do to me?

02:31.792 --> 02:33.834
Sorry, Kade.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.834
We're sorry.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.583
Are the baby birds okay,

02:33.875 --> 02:35.583
Boulder?

02:36.709 --> 02:39.959
They're wonderful.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.458
Aw, I think

02:40.000 --> 02:42.458
they like you.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.375
(  camera shutter snaps )

02:45.834 --> 02:47.959
( chuckles )

02:45.834 --> 02:47.959
Hey, it tickles.

02:50.709 --> 02:53.000
That was my favorite part!

02:53.041 --> 02:54.375
Hi, Daddy!

02:54.417 --> 02:55.583
I'll be ready in a sec.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.500
Look what we saw today.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.667
So far, I've spotted 27

02:59.709 --> 03:02.250
of the island's

02:59.709 --> 03:02.250
40 known bird species.

03:02.291 --> 03:03.875
Well, I think it's adorable.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.625
Pointless, but adorable.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.291
It's strange, though.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.458
I can't find those

03:08.333 --> 03:10.458
Woodpeckers in my book.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.000
Perhaps they're undercover.

03:12.041 --> 03:13.625
Is that why you're

03:12.041 --> 03:13.625
spying on them?

03:13.667 --> 03:15.000
Do you suspect them

03:13.667 --> 03:15.000
of some sort

03:15.041 --> 03:16.375
of woodland conspiracy?

03:16.417 --> 03:17.667
( beeps )

03:17.709 --> 03:19.792
I don't see the appeal,

03:17.709 --> 03:19.792
but hey,

03:19.834 --> 03:21.542
watch whatever animals

03:19.834 --> 03:21.542
you want.

03:21.583 --> 03:22.834
I have quite a soft spot

03:22.875 --> 03:24.959
for the Picinae

03:22.875 --> 03:24.959
subfamily myself.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.458
Maybe I can identify the...

03:27.500 --> 03:28.709
Oh, my.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.291
Something wrong, Doc?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.291
On the contrary.

03:31.333 --> 03:32.834
The reason Boulder's book

03:32.875 --> 03:34.375
doesn't have a picture

03:32.875 --> 03:34.375
of the birds,

03:34.417 --> 03:36.542
is that they're extinct.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.959
( gasps )

03:38.000 --> 03:40.500
Well, everyone

03:38.000 --> 03:40.500
thought they were.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.750
Obviously,

03:40.542 --> 03:42.750
we were wrong.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.542
Doc's right.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.875
Boulder's found the first

03:44.583 --> 03:46.875
Golden-Crested Woodpecker

03:46.917 --> 03:48.792
anyone's seen in 40 years.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.583
Noble.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.583
That's awesome.

03:50.625 --> 03:51.834
Congratulations, Boulder.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.834
An extinct bird

03:51.875 --> 03:53.834
in Griffin Rock.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.917
This'll be huge news.

03:55.959 --> 03:59.625
No, we mustn't tell

03:55.959 --> 03:59.625
anyone about this.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.500
At least until I can

03:59.667 --> 04:02.500
contact the authorities.

04:02.542 --> 04:06.750
These birds need to be protected

04:02.542 --> 04:06.750
as an endangered species.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.583
The worst possible thing

04:06.792 --> 04:08.583
for them would be

04:08.625 --> 04:11.500
a crowd of tourists trampling

04:08.625 --> 04:11.500
through their habitat.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.834
I, for one, assure you

04:11.542 --> 04:13.834
that my lips,

04:13.875 --> 04:16.417
if I had any,

04:13.875 --> 04:16.417
would be sealed.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.750
No worries, Doc.

04:17.792 --> 04:19.792
They'd have to drag

04:17.792 --> 04:19.792
it out of me.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.458
Nice, Boulder.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.000
It's not every day you

04:21.500 --> 04:24.000
make scientific history.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.792
Even if you can't

04:24.041 --> 04:25.792
tell the world.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.709
Yeah, like we don't already

04:25.834 --> 04:28.709
know how that feels.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.625
( grunting )

04:33.667 --> 04:36.792
We all know our mission

04:33.667 --> 04:36.792
is to serve and protect humans.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.625
But what about

04:36.834 --> 04:38.625
those creatures who need

04:38.667 --> 04:40.125
protection from humans.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.417
Oh, dear.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.417
That is not only ironic,

04:42.458 --> 04:44.041
but quite the moral dilemma.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.625
The babies especially

04:44.083 --> 04:46.625
need guarding.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.000
They can't even fly.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.083
Aww, like helpless

04:48.041 --> 04:50.083
little kittens,

04:50.125 --> 04:51.625
but with tiny wings.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.792
It's a whole

04:51.667 --> 04:53.792
caboodle of cuteness.

04:53.834 --> 04:54.959
I'm in.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.375
As am I...

04:56.417 --> 04:57.959
if Chief will allow it.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.750
I suppose so,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.750
on the condition

05:00.792 --> 05:02.834
that you don't

05:00.792 --> 05:02.834
neglect your real jobs.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.875
Great. Heatwave, you in?

05:04.917 --> 05:06.667
( Heatwave grunts )

05:06.709 --> 05:09.667
Our job is keeping people safe,

05:06.709 --> 05:09.667
not birds.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.792
This whole thing just seems too

05:09.709 --> 05:11.792
far off mission.

05:11.834 --> 05:13.041
( grunts )

05:13.083 --> 05:15.667
Count me out.

05:15.709 --> 05:17.667
CODY:

05:15.709 --> 05:17.667
Okay. Woodpeckers: check.

05:17.709 --> 05:20.041
Rescuers: check. Now what?

05:20.083 --> 05:21.917
Now we guard them.

05:21.959 --> 05:24.083
I will secure

05:21.959 --> 05:24.083
the perimeter.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.959
Well, this is exciting.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.792
Maybe the birds would like some

05:37.000 --> 05:40.792
of those flower bushes here.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.542
You know,

05:40.834 --> 05:42.542
to make things prettier.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.500
Good idea.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.500
We could get rid of these

05:44.542 --> 05:46.500
old dry logs to make room.

06:05.041 --> 06:06.709
There.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.041
I bet the birds

06:06.750 --> 06:09.041
will love these flowers.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.125
( bees buzzing )

06:12.166 --> 06:14.583
Ah! The bees sure do.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.458
I'll just plant them

06:16.250 --> 06:19.458
a little further away.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.875
I don't know,

06:22.166 --> 06:24.875
something's got them spooked.

06:24.917 --> 06:28.417
Maybe some nice soothing

06:24.917 --> 06:28.417
music would calm them down.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.041
I have an mp3 player.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.583
We could plug it

06:30.083 --> 06:32.583
into Blades' P.A.

06:36.625 --> 06:37.792
( loud techno music playing )

06:37.834 --> 06:40.458
Too loud! Turn it down!

06:42.625 --> 06:44.750
I can't! It's stuck.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.917
I can hardly mount

06:44.792 --> 06:46.917
a protective stake-out

06:46.959 --> 06:49.625
with all that noise.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.500
( music stops )

06:52.542 --> 06:54.083
Dad.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.166
I thought I'd check

06:54.125 --> 06:56.166
in to see how it's going.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.250
I didn't realize your plan

06:56.208 --> 06:58.250
to protect the woodpeckers

06:58.291 --> 07:00.083
included scaring

06:58.291 --> 07:00.083
them to death.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.625
( sighs )

07:01.667 --> 07:02.959
I know you all mean well,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.583
but you need

07:03.000 --> 07:04.583
to find a balance

07:04.625 --> 07:07.000
between doing nothing

07:04.625 --> 07:07.000
and going overboard.

07:07.041 --> 07:10.041
Or you risk all kinds

07:07.041 --> 07:10.041
of unintended consequences.

07:12.125 --> 07:15.750
Hey, the babies are out,

07:12.125 --> 07:15.750
and they look ready to fly.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.917
Birdies, it's easy.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.792
Just do what

07:17.959 --> 07:20.792
I did the first time.

07:20.834 --> 07:23.166
Close your eyes

07:20.834 --> 07:23.166
and scream.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.667
( grunts )

07:28.709 --> 07:30.291
( screaming )

07:30.333 --> 07:31.917
( screams )

07:33.000 --> 07:34.875
( car crashes)

07:37.291 --> 07:40.125
Confound it, Harrison.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.750
Sorry.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.834
( grunts and yells )

07:51.333 --> 07:53.000
CHIEF:

07:51.333 --> 07:53.000
Guys, when you're

07:51.333 --> 07:53.000
done with that,

07:53.041 --> 07:54.625
there are two more calls.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.208
Dad,

07:54.667 --> 07:56.208
this isn't fair.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.625
We're carrying the whole load,

07:57.667 --> 07:59.125
while everyone else

07:57.667 --> 07:59.125
is baby-sitting.

07:59.166 --> 08:02.208
Those birds didn't look

07:59.166 --> 08:02.208
so endangered to me. Oh.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.083
Did you say endangered birds?

08:05.125 --> 08:07.250
On our fair little island?

08:07.291 --> 08:10.000
Well, I meant...

08:07.291 --> 08:10.000
dangerous birds.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.792
Like, uh, eagles.

08:11.834 --> 08:13.667
And, uh, and, uh, vultures.

08:13.709 --> 08:14.875
Oh, and, uh, barracudas.

08:14.917 --> 08:17.667
Kade, do I look like a fool?

08:17.709 --> 08:19.291
Uh, well. Uh--

08:19.333 --> 08:22.333
As mayor,

08:19.333 --> 08:22.333
I order you to come clean.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.166
Fine.

08:24.208 --> 08:28.000
I heard there's a family

08:24.208 --> 08:28.000
of Golden-Crested Woodpeckers

08:28.041 --> 08:29.834
that everyone thinks

08:28.041 --> 08:29.834
is extinct.

08:29.875 --> 08:32.667
But it's a secret,

08:29.875 --> 08:32.667
so don't say anything, please.

08:32.709 --> 08:34.875
Don't worry, my boy.

08:34.917 --> 08:37.166
I know how to keep a secret.

08:37.208 --> 08:38.750
I'm a politician.

08:38.792 --> 08:39.959
( chuckles )

08:40.000 --> 08:42.166
Well, thanks for the rescue.

08:42.208 --> 08:43.875
Toodle-oo.

08:43.917 --> 08:46.000
Robot, vehicle mode.

08:51.375 --> 08:55.208
Alper, ever hear of

08:51.375 --> 08:55.208
the Golden-Crested Woodpecker?

08:55.250 --> 08:57.375
No? Well, look it up.

08:57.417 --> 08:59.125
And get out your floaties,

08:59.166 --> 09:02.875
because we are about

08:59.166 --> 09:02.875
to be swimming in tourists.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.333
( laughs )

09:06.375 --> 09:10.125
And I'm thrilled

09:06.375 --> 09:10.125
to announce the re-discovery

09:10.166 --> 09:12.875
of the Golden-Crested

09:10.166 --> 09:12.875
Woodpecker,

09:12.917 --> 09:15.208
right here in Griffin Rock,

09:15.250 --> 09:20.750
soon to be the no longer extinct

09:15.250 --> 09:20.750
bird capital of the world.

09:20.792 --> 09:23.041
Everybody? Code Red.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.750
The Mayor's giving

09:23.083 --> 09:24.750
a press conference

09:24.792 --> 09:26.208
about the Woodpeckers.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.834
CHIEF:  What? Who told him?

09:26.250 --> 09:28.834
Who else?

09:28.875 --> 09:32.041
Mr. "They'd Have To

09:28.875 --> 09:32.041
Drag It Out Of Me."

09:32.083 --> 09:33.625
Kade.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.750
Ow. He made me.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.375
Besides,

09:35.792 --> 09:37.375
it wouldn't have happened

09:37.417 --> 09:39.375
if everyone wasn't running

09:37.417 --> 09:39.375
around the forest.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.875
Someone should have been

09:39.417 --> 09:41.875
there to shut me up.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.291
Right.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.291
Like we can ever do that.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.083
Mayor Luskey,

09:44.333 --> 09:47.083
the world wants to know

09:47.125 --> 09:50.792
who is the discoverer

09:47.125 --> 09:50.792
of these amazing birds?

09:50.834 --> 09:53.333
Well,

09:50.834 --> 09:53.333
I'm sworn to secrecy.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.667
But between you and me--

09:55.709 --> 09:57.834
And my vast television

09:55.709 --> 09:57.834
audience--

09:57.875 --> 10:03.000
The Burns family may be able

09:57.875 --> 10:03.000
to shed some light on this.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.667
( phone rings )

10:05.709 --> 10:06.959
What if it's Huxley?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.667
What if it's someone in trouble?

10:10.083 --> 10:13.083
Griffin R--

10:10.083 --> 10:13.083
Oh. Hi, Mr. Prescott.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.417
Rats.

10:14.458 --> 10:16.792
Why couldn't someone

10:14.458 --> 10:16.792
be in trouble?

10:16.834 --> 10:18.125
That came out wrong.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.458
HUXLEY:

10:18.166 --> 10:19.458
Cody Burns, the truth.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.959
Was it, as the mayor implies,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.083
one of the Burns family

10:22.000 --> 10:24.083
who discovered

10:24.125 --> 10:26.166
our Golden-Crested treasure?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.667
No. Uh, not exactly.

10:28.709 --> 10:30.208
It was, um...

10:30.250 --> 10:32.417
more like a friend

10:30.250 --> 10:32.417
of the family.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.333
Cody, the public

10:32.458 --> 10:34.333
has a right to know.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.917
And this nose for news

10:34.375 --> 10:36.917
won't stop

10:36.959 --> 10:38.834
until I sniff out the truth.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.667
The whole truth.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.458
Great. Now your "Bird Patrol"

10:42.500 --> 10:44.792
has put our secret

10:42.500 --> 10:44.792
in jeopardy too.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.083
You're right.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.083
I got us into this,

10:47.125 --> 10:49.291
I'll get us out.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.291
I'll talk to him.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.875
Ooh, fun.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.166
I'll get Graham's

10:50.917 --> 10:53.166
voice-altering thingy.

10:53.208 --> 10:57.500
It'll be like an episode

10:53.208 --> 10:57.500
of "My Sister, the Mob Boss."

10:57.542 --> 11:01.458
Well, what's it going to be?

10:57.542 --> 11:01.458
Don't blow it.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.208
Mr. Prescott?

11:01.500 --> 11:04.208
I'll, uh, patch you through,

11:04.250 --> 11:06.709
but the person wants

11:04.250 --> 11:06.709
to stay anonymous.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.917
You can't ask their

11:06.750 --> 11:08.917
name or anything else.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.000
Strange, but very well.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.333
Hello?

11:12.375 --> 11:15.208
Mysterious friend?

11:15.250 --> 11:18.875
( in girl's voice ):

11:15.250 --> 11:18.875
Hello. How are you?

11:18.917 --> 11:21.041
Well, hello there, sweetie.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.166
Will you tell

11:21.083 --> 11:23.166
our audience all about

11:23.208 --> 11:25.834
how you found

11:23.208 --> 11:25.834
the little birdies?

11:27.208 --> 11:29.083
( in deep voice ):

11:27.208 --> 11:29.083
Of course.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.125
I was just enjoying a day

11:31.166 --> 11:33.375
of bird-watching in the forest.

11:33.417 --> 11:36.458
Ah. I love birds.

11:37.542 --> 11:40.208
Is this some sort of joke?

11:40.250 --> 11:43.041
Ah. Forget the gizmo.

11:43.083 --> 11:46.959
Huxley's only heard

11:43.083 --> 11:46.959
you as a robot anyway.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.208
( in normal voice ):

11:47.000 --> 11:49.208
Sorry, phone connection.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.917
The birds are... beautiful.

11:51.959 --> 11:53.375
With perfect crests,

11:53.417 --> 11:55.417
and the babies are adorable.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.375
Baby birds.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.375
Hear that, folks?

11:58.417 --> 12:00.500
WOMAN:  Oh, I can't wait to see.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.500
MAN:  Look at the birdies.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.041
They're wonderful

12:00.542 --> 12:02.041
creatures who

12:02.083 --> 12:03.500
just need a place

12:02.083 --> 12:03.500
to call home,

12:03.542 --> 12:05.875
and some shelter

12:03.542 --> 12:05.875
from the storm.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.041
Just like any of us.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.750
All I want is to help.

12:09.792 --> 12:12.208
Oh, I can tell, friend.

12:09.792 --> 12:12.208
I can tell.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.417
And I'm sure bird fans

12:12.250 --> 12:14.417
everywhere

12:14.458 --> 12:17.417
will be flocking here

12:14.458 --> 12:17.417
for a peek at a beak.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.917
Where exactly is their nest?

12:19.959 --> 12:22.375
Oh, no, no, no.

12:19.959 --> 12:22.375
They're not ready for that.

12:22.417 --> 12:25.083
Everyone,

12:22.417 --> 12:25.083
just leave them alone.

12:25.125 --> 12:28.041
There. That'll be

12:25.125 --> 12:28.041
the end of it.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.500
So not the end of it.

12:32.542 --> 12:35.417
Talk about your unintended

12:32.542 --> 12:35.417
consequences.

12:35.458 --> 12:39.083
I'm pretty sure this is exactly

12:35.458 --> 12:39.083
what the mayor intended.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.917
Ho, ho! I tell you, Alper,

12:41.959 --> 12:44.250
this was a stroke of genius.

12:44.291 --> 12:47.959
Those birds mean

12:44.291 --> 12:47.959
steady revenue for years.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.417
Well, there's the mayo

12:48.000 --> 12:51.417
The guy from TV.

12:51.458 --> 12:53.959
Yeah. I came all

12:51.458 --> 12:53.959
the way from Ohio.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.834
I want to see the birds.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.333
( crowd murmuring )

12:57.375 --> 13:01.125
Well, now, it's hard to say

12:57.375 --> 13:01.125
where, exactly...

13:01.166 --> 13:03.083
Uh, you know birds,

13:03.125 --> 13:05.041
they, fly every-- There!

13:05.083 --> 13:08.458
Uh, Kade Burns is the one

13:05.083 --> 13:08.458
who told me about them.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.083
Ask him.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.083
Ha.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.458
I knew the Burnses

13:10.125 --> 13:13.458
were hiding something.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.959
Confess, Kade Burns.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.500
You discovered the birds.

13:18.542 --> 13:20.500
What? No way. Not me.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.875
Then your brother Graham?

13:22.917 --> 13:24.208
Well, wasn't him either.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.250
Or Dani, or Chief, or Cody.

13:26.291 --> 13:29.125
Right. Next I suppose

13:26.291 --> 13:29.125
you'll tell me

13:29.166 --> 13:30.959
it was one

13:29.166 --> 13:30.959
of your Rescue Bots.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.500
( chuckles nervously )

13:32.542 --> 13:34.125
Good one, Huxley.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.542
Kade, I demand you tell us.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.250
The public's right to know,

13:38.291 --> 13:39.875
et cetera, so forth...

13:39.917 --> 13:41.083
( sighs )

13:41.125 --> 13:43.583
Okay. I found the birds.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.542
( crowd murmurs )

13:45.583 --> 13:49.500
Now that your secret's out,

13:45.583 --> 13:49.500
tell us, Kade,

13:49.542 --> 13:53.000
what is the Golden-Crested

13:49.542 --> 13:53.000
Woodpecker really like?

13:53.041 --> 13:54.417
Oh, well, it's a bird.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.417
Uh, with, uh... wings.

13:57.458 --> 14:00.041
And it pecks wood.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.583
Yes, yes, but I think what

14:03.625 --> 14:07.000
we all want to know is,

14:03.625 --> 14:07.000
where does it live?

14:07.041 --> 14:08.500
Oh, no. Somebody call Kade

14:08.542 --> 14:10.291
and stop him

14:08.542 --> 14:10.291
before it's too late.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.542
I'm calling, I'm calling.

14:11.583 --> 14:12.959
In a tree.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.542
In a hole in a tree.

14:14.583 --> 14:19.041
Fine. But where on the island?

14:19.083 --> 14:20.625
Don't say it.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.625
Come on, son.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.333
You can't tell him.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.333
Pick up the phone.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.125
Pick up the phone.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.125
Don't say they're at--

14:24.166 --> 14:25.333
Blossom Vale.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.166
( exasperated groans )

14:25.375 --> 14:28.166
Kade.

14:28.208 --> 14:30.125
Blossom Vale.

14:33.166 --> 14:38.000
And let me take this opportunity

14:33.166 --> 14:38.000
to announce the forthcoming

14:38.041 --> 14:42.041
Woodpecker Wonderland

14:38.041 --> 14:42.041
Luxury Campgrounds

14:42.083 --> 14:43.917
to be built, coincidentally,

14:43.959 --> 14:46.625
in beautiful Blossom Vale.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.458
This is going to get ugly.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.208
Bird-watchers are

14:48.500 --> 14:51.208
a very determined group.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.208
I heard that some took over

14:51.250 --> 14:53.208
a whole county once

14:53.250 --> 14:55.000
to find a rare bird.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.375
( sigh )

14:55.041 --> 14:57.375
Which means lots of visitors

14:55.041 --> 14:57.375
getting lost,

14:57.417 --> 14:59.458
chased by bears, or worse.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.417
Looks like we're going

14:59.500 --> 15:01.417
to have our hands full.

15:01.458 --> 15:02.583
You guys go.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.083
I'll wait for Kade.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.542
Someone needs to stay in town,

15:05.583 --> 15:07.959
in case there's

15:05.583 --> 15:07.959
a real emergency.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.417
Thanks for the lift, Blades.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.083
All right, we seem to have

15:13.458 --> 15:16.083
arrived ahead of the crowds.

15:16.125 --> 15:18.000
Chase, Boulder,

15:16.125 --> 15:18.000
are you in position?

15:18.041 --> 15:19.208
Affirmative, sir.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.542
We are patrolling

15:19.250 --> 15:20.542
the perimeter.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.417
CHIEF:

15:20.583 --> 15:22.417
Doc, how are the birds doing?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.250
They seem just fine.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.250
Hmm, those worms

15:24.291 --> 15:27.250
remind me it's lunchtime.

15:27.291 --> 15:30.709
And I have a strange

15:27.291 --> 15:30.709
craving for spaghetti.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.583
( demanding yells )

15:34.625 --> 15:36.166
Sorry, folks.

15:36.208 --> 15:39.125
Till further notice,

15:36.208 --> 15:39.125
Blossom Vale is closed.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.417
( crowd clamoring )

15:43.291 --> 15:44.792
DANI ( over PA ):

15:43.291 --> 15:44.792
Unless you're a bird,

15:44.834 --> 15:46.709
this is a no-fly zone.

15:46.750 --> 15:50.000
Please leave the airspace.

15:50.041 --> 15:52.709
You too, Mr. Harrison.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.208
HUXLEY:

15:59.625 --> 16:01.208
The Burns family may have

16:01.250 --> 16:03.041
their robot thugs

16:01.250 --> 16:03.041
standing guard,

16:03.083 --> 16:05.083
but never fear, viewers,

16:05.125 --> 16:07.792
nothing will stop

16:05.125 --> 16:07.792
Huxley Prescott.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.417
Nothing.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.291
Except that.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.125
( screams )

16:19.667 --> 16:22.709
( all clamoring )

16:22.750 --> 16:24.208
I'm sure we'll work this out,

16:24.250 --> 16:26.542
but right now,

16:24.250 --> 16:26.542
for the good of everyone,

16:26.583 --> 16:29.291
Blossom Vale

16:26.583 --> 16:29.291
must remain closed.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.709
What? What are you--

16:30.750 --> 16:32.333
Oh. A-ha.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.166
Chief, I have here a court order

16:35.208 --> 16:40.166
to open Blossom Vale for

16:35.208 --> 16:40.166
unlimited camping immediately.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.667
( laughs )

16:42.709 --> 16:44.792
Looks like we have no choice.

16:44.834 --> 16:47.625
But all these people will scare

16:44.834 --> 16:47.625
the woodpeckers away.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.333
Sorry, kids.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.041
Okay, let 'em in.

16:52.583 --> 16:54.500
( all cheering )

17:18.417 --> 17:21.500
MAN:

17:18.417 --> 17:21.500
Fire! Fire!

17:23.709 --> 17:27.458
( people screaming )

17:34.875 --> 17:37.208
( all clamoring )

17:37.250 --> 17:38.750
Let's get these

17:37.250 --> 17:38.750
people to safety.

17:38.792 --> 17:42.166
On our way, Dad.

17:38.792 --> 17:42.166
Be there in two shakes.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.542
( robot voice ):

17:42.208 --> 17:44.542
Attention humans,

17:42.208 --> 17:44.542
please form a single line

17:44.583 --> 17:47.208
and proceed in an orderly

17:44.583 --> 17:47.208
fashion behind me.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.834
You may elect

17:47.250 --> 17:48.834
to arrange yourselves

17:48.875 --> 17:51.709
by either height or age.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.834
Don't forget the Woodpeckers.

17:53.875 --> 17:56.709
Human lives come first.

17:53.875 --> 17:56.709
The birds will be fine.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.750
Boulder. The hill where you

17:56.750 --> 17:59.750
got the flower bushes.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.834
We could use that

17:59.792 --> 18:01.834
loose dirt as a firebreak.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.625
Good thinking.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.625
Let's go for it.

18:17.458 --> 18:19.417
Okay, Blades, until

18:17.458 --> 18:19.417
Kade and Heatwave get here,

18:19.458 --> 18:20.625
we're the water brigade.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.709
BLADES:

18:27.625 --> 18:29.709
He shoots, he scores.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.208
Yay, me.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.166
( sputters )

18:31.250 --> 18:34.166
Hey.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.625
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.750
Accident.

18:37.792 --> 18:38.583
Right?

18:38.625 --> 18:40.792
Um, mostly.

18:40.834 --> 18:42.667
( sirens wailing )

18:42.709 --> 18:45.458
The cavalry has arrived.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.375
HEATWAVE:

18:59.875 --> 19:01.375
I warned you.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.208
If you'd just minded

19:01.417 --> 19:03.208
your own business,

19:03.250 --> 19:04.458
there'd have been

19:03.250 --> 19:04.458
no interviews,

19:04.500 --> 19:07.834
no crowds, no dry logs,

19:04.500 --> 19:07.834
and no fire.

19:07.875 --> 19:10.875
I know. You're right.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.917
But at least we

19:10.917 --> 19:12.917
saved the Woodpeckers.

19:12.959 --> 19:16.375
Um, guys?

19:19.041 --> 19:20.583
They're... gone.

19:24.583 --> 19:25.834
( sighs )

19:25.875 --> 19:28.375
DANI:

19:25.875 --> 19:28.375
Oh, Boulder, I'm so sorry.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.667
All we did... and we couldn't

19:28.417 --> 19:31.667
even save the birds.

19:31.709 --> 19:33.667
I wish I'd never seen them.

19:33.709 --> 19:34.959
Then nobody would've known,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.750
and they'd be safe.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.500
Sorry, partner.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.917
Law of unintended consequences.

19:40.959 --> 19:43.750
One of the few laws even

19:40.959 --> 19:43.750
I wish could be circumvented.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.250
Don't feel bad, team.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.208
At least your hearts

19:45.291 --> 19:47.208
were in the right place.

19:47.250 --> 19:50.875
Human hearts are movable?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Why so morose,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
my metallic mates?

19:56.041 --> 19:57.875
The re-extinction

19:56.041 --> 19:57.875
of a species

19:57.917 --> 19:59.667
is hardly cause

19:57.917 --> 19:59.667
for celebration.

19:59.709 --> 20:01.542
And it's all my fault.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.917
Don't be quite so funereal.

20:03.959 --> 20:06.834
Our Golden-Crested friends

20:03.959 --> 20:06.834
may be endangered,

20:06.875 --> 20:09.333
but they're hardly helpless.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.542
When I went to check on

20:09.375 --> 20:11.542
the Woodpeckers earlier,

20:11.583 --> 20:13.667
I leg-tagged

20:11.583 --> 20:13.667
them all with tracers,

20:13.709 --> 20:15.834
so I could keep tabs on them.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.709
The birds saw the fire

20:15.875 --> 20:18.709
and flew over to the next valley

20:18.750 --> 20:20.417
with their babies.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.417
They're all okay.

20:20.458 --> 20:21.709
All right.

20:20.458 --> 20:21.709
Splendid.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.041
They are?

20:21.750 --> 20:23.041
Noble.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.709
And, since they

20:23.083 --> 20:25.709
are quite territorial,

20:25.750 --> 20:27.709
I'm certain they'll soon

20:25.750 --> 20:27.709
return to their home

20:27.750 --> 20:29.458
in Blossom Vale.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.917
But we still went overboard

20:29.500 --> 20:31.917
trying to protect them.

20:31.959 --> 20:34.542
We were almost as bad

20:31.959 --> 20:34.542
as those bird-watchers.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.417
We can't let that

20:34.583 --> 20:36.417
happen again.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.625
CODY:

20:36.458 --> 20:38.625
Well, maybe it's what

20:36.458 --> 20:38.625
my dad said

20:38.667 --> 20:40.333
about finding a balance.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.875
I wonder if there's

20:40.375 --> 20:41.875
some way to do that

20:41.917 --> 20:43.583
with the woodpeckers.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.041
Find a way they can be safe,

20:45.083 --> 20:47.000
while people still

20:45.083 --> 20:47.000
get to see them.

20:47.041 --> 20:52.583
Hm. Cody, I believe

20:47.041 --> 20:52.583
you've given me an idea.

20:52.625 --> 20:55.709
MAYOR LUSKEY:

20:52.625 --> 20:55.709
And so, after consultation

20:52.625 --> 20:55.709
with Doc Greene,

20:55.750 --> 20:58.959
I'm very pleased to announce

20:55.750 --> 20:58.959
the establishment

20:59.000 --> 21:01.959
of the Luskey Bird Sanctuary,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.667
a haven for endangered birds,

21:04.709 --> 21:07.458
and the people who

21:04.709 --> 21:07.458
will pay to see them.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.375
We'll admit only

21:07.500 --> 21:10.375
a few people at a time,

21:10.417 --> 21:12.542
so as not to disturb the birds.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.458
But our web-cam will

21:12.583 --> 21:15.458
allow bird-watchers

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
all over the

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
world to enjoy

21:17.542 --> 21:19.083
our Golden-Crested friends

21:19.125 --> 21:21.875
as they rebuild

21:19.125 --> 21:21.875
their population.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.083
Yay us.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.458
( dramatic theme playing )
