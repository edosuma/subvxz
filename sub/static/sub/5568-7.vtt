18:58.271 --> 18:59.437
What do you mean?

18:59.439 --> 19:01.606
Well, there's so many rules
over there.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.741
You have to eat dinner
at the table every night,

19:03.743 --> 19:06.444
you have to do your chores,
you can't have a lizard.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.113
That's not weird.
<i>Your</i> house is weird.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.448
What's weird about my house?

19:10.450 --> 19:13.184
Dude, you fart on your mom!

19:13.186 --> 19:15.520
Whatever.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.488
Night, man.

[ Sighs ]

19:21.494 --> 19:24.762
¶ I get so emotional, baby ¶

19:24.764 --> 19:25.930
Christa: Whoo!

19:25.932 --> 19:28.499
¶ Every time I think of you ¶

19:28.501 --> 19:29.634
[ exhales deeply ]

19:29.636 --> 19:31.169
¶ I get so emo... ¶

[ knock on door ]

19:37.310 --> 19:38.442
Eddie? [ Gasps ]

19:38.444 --> 19:39.844
Louis, wake up!
Eddie's home!

19:39.846 --> 19:42.146
I'm awake.
Everything all right?

19:42.148 --> 19:44.215
Yeah, it's fine.
I don't know.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.551
I just wanted to come home.
Is that okay?

19:46.553 --> 19:50.221
Of course it is.
I'm just surprised.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.823
I-I thought
you would have fun at Dave's.

19:51.824 --> 19:55.293
I did.
And then... I didn't.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.895
[ Sighs ]
I like being with my friends,

19:57.897 --> 20:01.365
but I like being at home, too.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.301
Do you want me
to make you birthday noodles?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.403
Sure.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.905
Doesn't that take
like six hours?

20:07.907 --> 20:11.876
It is for my son.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.081
Emery: Are those
Eddie's birthday noodles?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.884
But it's not even
his birthday anymore.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.485
What are you doing up so late?

20:21.487 --> 20:24.589
It's way past your bedtime.
You two are grounded.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.992
Both: Yay!

20:27.994 --> 20:29.894
Wait.
Where are you going?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.330
It took me six hours
to make these noodles.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.831
Noodles, then bed,
then grounded.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.503
Eddie: I don't know
what I missed more...

20:39.505 --> 20:42.206
Your noodles or your rules.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.275
Chew with your mouth closed.

20:44.277 --> 20:47.111
Noodles, definitely.

20:52.518 --> 20:55.119
So I said, "ma'am, you can stay",

20:55.121 --> 20:57.054
but your dog's
got to go."

20:57.056 --> 20:59.423
[ Both laugh ]

20:59.425 --> 21:01.125
When did you guys
become friends?

21:01.127 --> 21:02.426
What?

21:02.428 --> 21:04.195
Well, we were in the service
together.

21:04.197 --> 21:05.930
What are you talking about?

21:05.932 --> 21:07.531
The table service.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.634
You know, during
the fajita craze?

21:09.636 --> 21:12.937
Once a fajita man,
always a fajita man.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.239
[ Both imitate sizzling ]

21:15.241 --> 21:16.907
See this?

21:16.909 --> 21:19.110
Shrimp jumped off a skillet,
got me right here.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.711
That's nothing.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.947
Chicken/beef combo, extra oil.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.950
Uh, look at this scar.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.386
An old man with dementia
stabbed me on the street.
