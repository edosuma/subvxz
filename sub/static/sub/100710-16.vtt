00:01.343 --> 00:02.977
Sunshine keeping quiet?

00:02.980 --> 00:05.479
Our source confirms
she hasn't said a word

00:05.481 --> 00:06.982
since her arrest yesterday.

00:06.984 --> 00:08.984
But Captain West won't
stop making noise.

00:08.986 --> 00:10.986
He is obsessed with connecting you

00:10.988 --> 00:14.522
to Sunshine, Ultraviolet, and Dr. Light.

00:14.524 --> 00:17.025
That won't matter much longer.

00:17.027 --> 00:18.827
When will our guest arrive?

00:22.432 --> 00:24.365
Thanks for coming on short notice.

00:24.367 --> 00:26.300
This is your target.

00:30.007 --> 00:31.539
Kill him, please.

00:52.996 --> 00:55.465
And... go.

00:57.735 --> 00:59.735
Like a map of some kind?

00:59.737 --> 01:01.669
- No.
- That's a flux capacitor.

01:01.671 --> 01:02.838
Hold... no.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.504
- No, that's good, yeah.
- No.

01:04.507 --> 01:05.974
They are not gonna get this.

01:05.976 --> 01:08.094
- Oh, this is...
- Okay, hold on. All right.

01:11.380 --> 01:14.515
Okay, it was gonna be the Eiffel Tower.

01:14.517 --> 01:15.574
Oh, damn.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.397
That looks just like the Eiffel Tower.

01:20.596 --> 01:22.019
Oh, I got to take this.

01:22.021 --> 01:23.143
Hey, David.

01:23.145 --> 01:24.635
Joe, I know you think we can tie

01:24.637 --> 01:26.158
this assassin Sunshine to Carver,

01:26.160 --> 01:27.661
but she is just not talking.

01:27.663 --> 01:30.364
Okay, so let me take a crack at it.

01:30.366 --> 01:32.633
Actually, I need you to take
a step back from this case.

01:32.635 --> 01:34.135
You're too close to it.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.494
Besides, you're the Captain now.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.554
David, it's because I'm
close that I can rattle her.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.440
Come on, there's nobody
else that can do this.

01:39.442 --> 01:41.977
Okay.

01:41.979 --> 01:44.745
Oh, okay.

01:44.747 --> 01:46.047
Was that the Carver case?

01:46.049 --> 01:47.883
- Yeah.
- How can I help?

01:47.885 --> 01:50.018
You just conserve your energy.

01:50.020 --> 01:52.353
I'll call you if I need anything.

01:52.355 --> 01:54.089
I got to go, guys. Take care.

01:54.091 --> 01:55.756
- Oh, okay, bye.
- Bye.

02:00.998 --> 02:02.864
I think I found a way out of here.

02:02.866 --> 02:04.598
What? How?

02:04.600 --> 02:07.601
I started focusing on the monitors.

02:07.603 --> 02:10.193
At first, when I tried,
I couldn't read them.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.140
I would get all of these,
um... these headaches.

02:12.142 --> 02:13.909
- Yeah.
- But today...

02:13.911 --> 02:17.711
it started to come into focus...

02:17.713 --> 02:20.048
perfectly clear.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.017
You're adapting to this place.

02:22.019 --> 02:23.819
I read your theory

02:23.821 --> 02:26.087
that says that someone
could pass through the mirror

02:26.089 --> 02:28.123
if their molecular structure
was destabilized?

02:28.125 --> 02:29.157
Yes.

02:29.159 --> 02:31.592
Well, if I could just
contact my husband,

02:31.594 --> 02:33.727
I think he might be able to help us.

02:33.729 --> 02:36.730
Eva, my husband, Barry Allen,

02:36.732 --> 02:39.000
is The Flash.

02:39.002 --> 02:40.902
What?

02:40.904 --> 02:45.673
And with his speed, I think
he could phase us out of here.

02:45.675 --> 02:48.542
If his instantaneous velocity

02:48.544 --> 02:50.678
correlates with the limit
of the fractal surface,

02:50.680 --> 02:54.149
then... then he'll become intangible.

02:54.151 --> 02:56.750
So... it could work!

02:56.752 --> 02:58.887
Yes! Yes, I...

02:58.889 --> 03:01.655
I just... I need to recharge.

03:01.657 --> 03:03.859
I've been controlling
the mirror all morning,

03:03.861 --> 03:06.928
and I'm... I'm exhausted.

03:06.930 --> 03:09.663
Yeah, um, take all the time you need.

03:09.665 --> 03:13.168
I will, um, keep
trying to decipher more.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.735
Yeah. You... you do that.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.872
You're... you're on the right path.

03:16.874 --> 03:17.973
Yeah.

03:28.851 --> 03:31.652
She just did exactly
what I knew she would do.

03:31.654 --> 03:33.621
She even told me the
truth about her husband.

03:33.623 --> 03:35.523
Eva, Joe West is still looking

03:35.525 --> 03:36.790
into your husband's activities.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.626
He knows about Black Hole.

03:38.628 --> 03:39.895
Then it's only a matter of time

03:39.897 --> 03:42.796
before Barry Allen helps him.

03:46.802 --> 03:48.970
You have a new mission.

03:48.972 --> 03:52.073
The Flash is losing his speed.

03:52.075 --> 03:54.142
Drain him of the rest.

03:54.144 --> 03:55.532
Why do you care about The Flash?

03:55.534 --> 03:58.879
I don't. I care about my husband.

03:58.881 --> 04:01.649
The Flash is not gonna
take that away from me.

04:01.651 --> 04:03.251
Success is assured.

04:06.123 --> 04:07.621
I got your text. What's up?

04:07.623 --> 04:11.592
Okay, Carrie Mathison, red string much?

04:11.594 --> 04:13.594
I've been tracking Sue
since she disappeared.

04:13.596 --> 04:15.663
She's hit five banks in five locations.

04:15.665 --> 04:17.065
Every single one of them was doing

04:17.067 --> 04:19.505
some schmoozy cocktail
party when she did it.

04:19.507 --> 04:21.601
And while everybody
was sipping champagne

04:21.603 --> 04:23.637
and eating an overpriced meal, bam.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.140
Server rooms get hacked.

04:25.142 --> 04:27.741
Oh. I know that look.

04:27.743 --> 04:29.177
You found her next target.

04:29.179 --> 04:32.180
Of course I found her next target.

04:35.085 --> 04:38.585
The First National CC Bank is
holding an investors' brunch

04:38.587 --> 04:39.887
for their biggest clients.

04:39.889 --> 04:42.556
Fits Sue's M.O. to a T.

04:42.558 --> 04:44.653
Now, here's where you
come in, my friend.

04:44.655 --> 04:47.643
I need a hacker who can set
up a net to help catch her,

04:47.645 --> 04:49.936
somebody who can monitor
the security feed,

04:49.938 --> 04:53.701
somebody who speaks
bandwidth and knows binary.

04:53.703 --> 04:55.803
Mm, I'm not sure you
know how hacking works.

04:55.805 --> 04:56.828
Please.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.540
I've seen "You've Got
Mail" several times.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.209
But I know you've been working on

05:01.211 --> 05:03.211
the Artificial Speed Force, so...

05:03.213 --> 05:06.613
I have, but I'm running
simulations all day...

05:06.615 --> 05:10.118
simulations I don't
need to be there for.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.685
Look, here's the deal.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.155
I know how hard this
case has been on you.

05:14.157 --> 05:18.126
I should've been there to
help you from the beginning.

05:18.128 --> 05:20.996
So...

05:20.998 --> 05:22.796
So you're in?

05:22.798 --> 05:24.099
Will there be waffles?

05:25.801 --> 05:28.504
There better be waffles.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.090
No, no, no, no!

06:07.777 --> 06:10.278
♪ Ding ding dang a-dang dong ding dong ♪

06:10.280 --> 06:12.113
♪ Dingy dingy, son of a gun ♪

06:12.115 --> 06:14.115
♪ Ding ding dang a-dang dong ding dong ♪

06:14.117 --> 06:16.750
♪ Am I on the run? ♪

06:41.541 --> 06:44.396
Okay. Thank you.

06:44.398 --> 06:45.533
It was crazy.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.267
It was like it was
accelerating by itself.

06:48.269 --> 06:49.390
I mean, I know you won't believe this,

06:49.392 --> 06:51.369
but it was like somebody cut the brakes

06:51.371 --> 06:52.637
while I was driving.

06:52.639 --> 06:54.028
Is that even possible?

06:54.030 --> 06:55.986
I-I don't know. I'll find out.

06:55.988 --> 06:57.663
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

06:57.665 --> 06:59.311
It's Carver that needs to worry.

06:59.313 --> 07:00.967
You think Carver's the one behind this?

07:00.969 --> 07:03.147
Well, he knows I took
down one of his assassins,

07:03.149 --> 07:05.099
Millie Rawlins, AKA Sunshine.

07:05.101 --> 07:06.352
And he knows I'm the lead

07:06.354 --> 07:08.119
on the RICO case we're
building against him.

07:08.121 --> 07:09.421
Well, if that's true,

07:09.423 --> 07:11.323
we have to get you
in witness protection.

07:11.325 --> 07:12.868
You're just not safe out here, Joe.

07:12.870 --> 07:14.560
David, I'm not going anywhere.

07:14.562 --> 07:16.562
Look, if Carver is coming after me,

07:16.564 --> 07:18.079
that means he is scared.

07:18.081 --> 07:20.031
What do scared people
do? They make mistakes.

07:20.033 --> 07:22.867
We need to take advantage of that.

07:22.869 --> 07:24.869
Fine. Fine.

07:24.871 --> 07:26.880
You have my complete
support, Joe, as always.

07:26.882 --> 07:30.576
But if anything happens,
I'll never forgive myself.

07:30.578 --> 07:32.444
I need to go talk to Rawlins.

07:45.191 --> 07:48.460
Okay, the investors'
brunch is in full swing.

07:48.462 --> 07:50.895
Now, you go get us eyes
on that server room.

07:50.897 --> 07:53.264
I got to tinkle.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.401
- Yeah, I heard what I said.
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.413 --> 08:07.879
Okay.

08:07.881 --> 08:10.114
The doctor is in.

08:10.116 --> 08:11.949
Say, "Ah!"

08:18.392 --> 08:20.224
What?

08:20.226 --> 08:22.461
You call this an encryption scheme?

08:22.463 --> 08:25.997
I could do this with one
hand tied behind my back.

08:25.999 --> 08:28.099
Prove it.

08:28.101 --> 08:30.502
Uh, good morning.

08:30.504 --> 08:32.970
Don't mind me. I'm just doing
a routine software update.

08:32.972 --> 08:35.106
Can I have my hand back, please?

08:35.107 --> 08:38.409
You dress well... for tech support.

08:38.412 --> 08:41.044
- I have good work ethic.
- Hmm.

08:41.047 --> 08:42.113
Funny.

08:42.115 --> 08:43.405
It looked like you were tampering

08:43.407 --> 08:45.316
with the facility's security system,

08:45.318 --> 08:46.352
not repairing it.

08:46.354 --> 08:48.587
Tam... tamp... tampering?

08:48.589 --> 08:51.255
Oh, you... you mean all this?

08:51.257 --> 08:52.691
Yes, all of that.

08:52.693 --> 08:56.027
No, no, I'm... it's...
this is a procedure

08:56.029 --> 08:58.963
we follow to make sure
that your money's secure.

08:58.965 --> 09:01.032
That is, if the safety of your money

09:01.034 --> 09:03.402
is important you, Miss... ?

09:03.404 --> 09:07.004
Ms. January Galore.

09:07.006 --> 09:10.609
And the safety of my money
is very important to me.

09:10.611 --> 09:12.578
I'm sure it is.

09:12.580 --> 09:16.448
So what do those little green lights do?

09:16.450 --> 09:19.518
The... the... the...
the... the green lights.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.187
They are... they are not important.

09:23.189 --> 09:25.123
I'm actually all done here.

09:25.125 --> 09:27.125
Um, enjoy the waffles.

09:27.127 --> 09:29.162
Oh, I will.

09:35.034 --> 09:37.101
I think they only have
apple fritters here.

09:39.038 --> 09:41.072
Are we live?

09:41.074 --> 09:43.141
Yeah, we're live. We got eyes.

09:43.143 --> 09:44.976
We almost didn't get them, though.

09:44.978 --> 09:47.311
I ran into one of the donors...
some rich British lady.

09:47.313 --> 09:50.248
What was her name? June, April...

09:50.250 --> 09:52.718
- April Gabor.
- Wait.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.963
- January Galore?
- That's the one.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.355
That's not good.

09:56.357 --> 09:58.990
She's an arms dealer that
Barry and I met in Midway City.

09:58.992 --> 10:00.426
I don't know.

10:00.428 --> 10:02.226
She seemed kind of charming to me.

10:02.228 --> 10:04.430
Very forward, but charming nonetheless.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.768
Uh-oh. We're in trouble.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.402
The security feeds are dead.

10:11.404 --> 10:13.104
Servers are on the fifth floor.

10:13.106 --> 10:15.443
Let's go.

10:17.410 --> 10:19.143
Ew. Ew, ew, ew.

10:19.145 --> 10:21.513
What is that? What is that?

10:21.515 --> 10:22.714
The perfect disguise.

10:22.716 --> 10:24.182
A disg...

10:24.184 --> 10:26.785
I think I just lost my appetite.

10:32.292 --> 10:35.426
Hi, Slick. You miss me?

10:36.697 --> 10:38.530
Almost as much as I miss Fredrico,

10:38.532 --> 10:40.532
my tapeworm.

10:40.534 --> 10:43.134
Hello, Sue. Or is it January?

10:43.136 --> 10:44.803
What can I say?

10:44.805 --> 10:46.404
Collateralized loan obligations

10:46.406 --> 10:48.272
are deliciously robust.

10:48.274 --> 10:49.897
Although...

10:49.899 --> 10:52.289
Not half as delicious as you in a tux.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.715
Still up to your old tricks?
Swiping diamonds and pearls?

10:56.717 --> 10:58.940
Oh, you like Prince? Me too.

10:58.942 --> 11:02.488
Yes! Me three.

11:02.490 --> 11:05.037
I'm Cisco, by the way.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.527
We met back when you were...

11:06.529 --> 11:07.649
January Galore.

11:07.651 --> 11:09.207
That was an excellent
accent, by the way.

11:09.209 --> 11:10.998
- Do you have any training?
- Oh, thank you.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.089
- I did my senior year abroad.
- London, no doubt.

11:13.091 --> 11:16.300
- Oh, Italy, actually.
- She fancy. You fancy.

11:16.302 --> 11:17.769
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay!

11:17.771 --> 11:21.105
Sue, you're trapped,
and you're going down.

11:21.107 --> 11:23.241
Oh, actually, I'm going up.

11:24.678 --> 11:26.477
Ah. Did you see that?

11:26.479 --> 11:28.346
- What do you...
- Did you see that?

11:31.585 --> 11:34.485
Shoot. Damn it!

11:34.487 --> 11:36.855
Uh-oh. Dibs.

11:39.425 --> 11:41.860
If this is what she used,

11:41.862 --> 11:45.664
she has access to all the
bank's financial holdings.

11:45.666 --> 11:48.132
Oh, well...

11:48.134 --> 11:50.334
It's only several...

11:50.336 --> 11:52.203
billion...

11:52.205 --> 11:54.372
dollars.

11:56.376 --> 11:58.610
_

11:58.612 --> 12:00.411
Millie Rawlins.

12:02.816 --> 12:06.152
This man... he worked for Joseph Carver.

12:08.254 --> 12:12.758
This is what happens to
those who fail Carver.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.693
Incentive for the rest of us to succeed.

12:14.695 --> 12:17.829
But you didn't succeed.

12:17.831 --> 12:20.331
So that probably means you're next.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.401
Now, look, I can offer you protection.

12:23.403 --> 12:25.136
But this is a one-time deal.

12:25.138 --> 12:28.472
Are you interested?

12:28.474 --> 12:30.241
No, thanks.

12:30.243 --> 12:32.811
I mean, the only way somebody
could accelerate the car

12:32.813 --> 12:34.512
and simultaneously cut the brakes

12:34.514 --> 12:36.815
is from inside the
car's engine, which is...

12:36.817 --> 12:40.151
I mean, obviously no person
could fit inside there.

12:40.153 --> 12:41.587
Well, Ray Palmer could.

12:41.589 --> 12:46.390
Only he's not a
murderous, sabotaging type.

12:46.392 --> 12:50.896
How about a meta-human who
can squeeze into tight places?

12:50.898 --> 12:53.464
Likes to watch his victims
suffering up close.

12:53.466 --> 12:56.200
Rag Doll.

12:56.202 --> 12:59.203
Now...

12:59.205 --> 13:02.340
what would...

13:02.342 --> 13:05.576
First Lieutenant Millie Rawlins,

13:05.578 --> 13:08.279
a soldier who had rescued 14 friendlies

13:08.281 --> 13:09.815
from an insurgent labor camp,

13:09.817 --> 13:12.718
think of what you've become now?

13:12.720 --> 13:15.754
You were honorable.

13:15.756 --> 13:17.623
Legion of Merit.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.758
Medal of Valor.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.959
Millie,

13:20.961 --> 13:23.962
restore that honor.

13:23.964 --> 13:26.965
Help me stop Joseph Carver
before it's too late.

13:29.402 --> 13:30.636
Get down! Get down!

13:35.876 --> 13:37.776
What the hell?

14:01.835 --> 14:04.268
Aah!

14:07.440 --> 14:10.474
Joe, Joe, hey.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.256
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.627
I'm sorry.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.933
I'm fine. I'm all bandaged up.

14:25.935 --> 14:28.835
All right, Joe. That's twice now.

14:28.837 --> 14:32.606
And that's twice I've gotten
a clean bill of health.

14:32.608 --> 14:34.641
All right.

14:34.643 --> 14:36.077
Wait, hold on. Where are you going?

14:36.079 --> 14:38.778
Barry, I am still the
lead on this investigation.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.281
And I was this close to getting a deal

14:40.283 --> 14:41.983
with Rawlins if it wasn't...

14:41.985 --> 14:44.551
He's a dangerous psycho,
and he's got your number.

14:44.553 --> 14:46.853
All right, look, I-I-I hate to say it,

14:46.855 --> 14:47.889
but I-I don't know.

14:47.891 --> 14:49.456
It feels like maybe Singh was right.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.058
And you should let this go for a while.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.994
Oh, so you're gonna
take me off the case now.

14:52.996 --> 14:55.096
No, I just... I'm trying
to keep you safe, all right?

14:55.098 --> 14:57.227
And I-I'm not fast enough
to do that anymore.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.255
I mean, look at your arm.

14:58.257 --> 15:00.346
Well, Barry, you know I'm not
gonna stop if I'm this close.

15:00.348 --> 15:03.170
Look, I get it, but will
you please just stay here

15:03.172 --> 15:05.505
at S.T.A.R. Labs, at least
until I've stopped Rag Doll?

15:08.244 --> 15:09.743
Fine.

15:09.745 --> 15:11.645
Joe.

15:11.647 --> 15:13.813
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm good.

15:16.718 --> 15:19.653
- What happened?
- There was gunfire.

15:19.655 --> 15:22.889
And I wasn't fast enough
to stop all the bullets.

15:22.891 --> 15:26.793
He's... he's fine, but it's
my fault that he got hurt.

15:29.032 --> 15:32.233
- Barry, your speed.
- Yeah.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.001
- It's getting worse.
- I know.

15:34.003 --> 15:35.702
But what are you gonna do?

15:35.704 --> 15:37.637
I'm gonna use
facial-recognition algorithms

15:37.639 --> 15:38.896
and meta-human trackers.

15:38.898 --> 15:40.720
I'm gonna find Rag Doll and stop him

15:40.722 --> 15:41.976
if I have to use every last resource

15:41.978 --> 15:43.077
at S.T.A.R. Labs to do it.

15:43.079 --> 15:44.711
Except the one that counts.

15:45.905 --> 15:47.982
Barry, you promised me that
you would keep him safe.

15:47.984 --> 15:49.369
- I know.
- I can't lose my dad.

15:49.371 --> 15:51.285
You won't. I swear.

15:51.287 --> 15:52.786
I...

16:34.596 --> 16:35.829
Come in.

16:41.570 --> 16:43.937
When my private security
said I had a guest,

16:43.939 --> 16:46.307
the last person I expected to see was

16:46.309 --> 16:48.875
Captain Joe West.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.178
I suppose you're here on
urgent police business.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.280
Personal.

16:53.282 --> 16:55.349
You made it that way when
you tried to kill me...

16:55.351 --> 16:56.950
twice.

16:56.952 --> 16:59.086
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

16:59.088 --> 17:02.156
Peter Merkel, Rag Doll...

17:02.158 --> 17:06.060
Last he was seen was breaking
into McCulloch Technologies.

17:06.061 --> 17:07.794
That was about a year ago.

17:07.796 --> 17:09.996
Yes.

17:09.998 --> 17:12.799
We have had a number of
security issues lately,

17:12.800 --> 17:14.589
as I'm sure you're aware.

17:14.590 --> 17:16.903
Yeah, the strange thing is the CCPD

17:16.905 --> 17:19.073
never apprehended him.

17:19.075 --> 17:21.308
He just vanished...

17:21.310 --> 17:23.077
until today.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.744
Do you know anything about that?

17:25.747 --> 17:26.836
Sounds like you've crafted

17:26.838 --> 17:28.127
some very interesting narratives

17:28.130 --> 17:30.084
- about me, Captain West.
- Hmm.

17:30.086 --> 17:32.386
It even sounds like you're
saying I hired someone

17:32.388 --> 17:35.289
to pop out of a box to assassinate you.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.824
I mean...

17:37.826 --> 17:39.893
I didn't say

17:39.895 --> 17:42.096
that Rag Doll popped out of a box.

17:46.402 --> 17:49.270
Damn.

17:49.272 --> 17:51.773
And I was doing so well.

17:54.210 --> 17:56.277
You've been a pain in the ass, Captain.

17:56.279 --> 17:58.678
And you've taken up
far too much of my time.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.282
So I'm gonna make you
a one-time-only offer.

18:01.284 --> 18:03.184
I will call off Merkel,

18:03.186 --> 18:05.119
and all you have to do
is walk out that door

18:05.121 --> 18:07.720
and leave me alone forever.

18:07.722 --> 18:10.093
I'll make a counteroffer.

18:12.727 --> 18:16.863
You spend 80 years in Iron Heights

18:16.865 --> 18:21.668
for attempting to assassinate
the precinct captain.

18:21.670 --> 18:24.639
Technology is a fickle mistress.

18:33.182 --> 18:35.081
A localized DMP pulse.

18:37.052 --> 18:38.108
And one of the advantages

18:38.110 --> 18:40.566
of owning the most advanced
technological institution

18:40.568 --> 18:41.692
in the world.

18:41.694 --> 18:44.627
Whatever you think I've done,

18:45.379 --> 18:48.215
it's a million times worse.

18:50.065 --> 18:53.933
I can eliminate anyone, anywhere.

18:53.935 --> 18:57.070
And that includes you...

18:57.072 --> 19:00.176
or your lovely companion, Ms. Horton...

19:02.911 --> 19:06.012
Even that precious little baby of yours.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.103
You took your badge off

19:29.105 --> 19:31.339
and just walked right in there
knowing what could happen.

19:31.341 --> 19:33.007
I... What the hell were you thinking?

19:33.009 --> 19:34.842
Do you think I went
over to Carver's house

19:34.844 --> 19:35.976
for some macho BS?

19:35.978 --> 19:37.479
You know I'm not proud like that.

19:37.481 --> 19:39.449
I was just terrified I
can't protect my family.

19:39.451 --> 19:41.283
But you're the one who
needs protecting right now.

19:41.285 --> 19:43.251
I'm not worried about me, Barry.

19:43.253 --> 19:45.487
I can't lose Cecile and Jenna.

19:45.489 --> 19:47.696
And we can't lose you! Listen!

19:47.698 --> 19:50.765
Carver has unlimited resources, right?

19:50.767 --> 19:52.927
I mean, first it was Dr.
Light, then it was Sunshine.

19:52.929 --> 19:54.496
Today it's Rag Doll, and tomorrow...

19:54.498 --> 19:55.896
it's who knows?

19:55.898 --> 19:57.965
And now if I can't protect you...

19:57.967 --> 20:01.536
What do you want me to do?

20:01.538 --> 20:03.338
Think about witness protection.

20:04.874 --> 20:07.808
Joe, you need to stay alive.

20:14.817 --> 20:16.917
Committing to a five-year investment

20:16.919 --> 20:19.787
will guarantee you a
5% return, Miss Genoa.

20:19.789 --> 20:21.956
As for security, our server room

20:21.958 --> 20:24.959
is reinforced with
military-grade steel alloys.

20:24.961 --> 20:26.794
Hmm, sounds wonderfully impenetrable.

20:27.887 --> 20:31.678
Yeah, but nothing is impenetrable.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.071
Isn't that right, Ms. Dearbon?

20:35.073 --> 20:36.729
Dearbon?

20:36.731 --> 20:40.140
You said your name was
Genoa, like the salami.

20:40.142 --> 20:43.877
_

20:43.879 --> 20:45.336
Yeah, you know, she lied about that.

20:45.338 --> 20:49.083
It's kind of her thing.
She is stupid rich, though.

20:49.085 --> 20:52.188
Oh. In that case...

20:53.823 --> 20:56.291
How do you two know each
other? Are you married?

20:56.293 --> 20:59.294
Gross.

20:59.296 --> 21:02.497
Uh, do you mind excusing
us for a moment?

21:02.499 --> 21:04.932
I would love to speak to my friend

21:04.934 --> 21:07.167
about possibly investing here as well.

21:07.169 --> 21:09.404
By all means.

21:09.406 --> 21:11.341
Take your time.

21:17.046 --> 21:18.380
So, slick...

21:18.382 --> 21:21.215
you here to make a
super citizen's arrest?

21:21.217 --> 21:23.585
- I know what you're up to.
- Really?

21:23.587 --> 21:26.956
I'm all ears.

21:28.958 --> 21:32.527
The files on this are your
parents' bank accounts.

21:32.529 --> 21:35.062
They've been wiring money
every week like clockwork

21:35.064 --> 21:36.263
to a coded account.

21:36.265 --> 21:39.235
Your parents are being extorted.

21:41.203 --> 21:44.271
What? No snarky comeback?

21:44.273 --> 21:46.541
Oh. That means I'm right.

21:46.543 --> 21:48.476
You going somewhere with this?

21:48.478 --> 21:51.513
Well, my guess is that your
parents are being blackmailed

21:51.515 --> 21:54.114
by the same person who owns
every single banking system

21:54.116 --> 21:56.484
that you've hacked into
since we last met...

21:56.486 --> 21:58.285
Joseph Carver.

21:58.287 --> 22:00.154
Careful, slick.

22:00.156 --> 22:01.889
You weren't stealing anything

22:01.891 --> 22:05.059
in Paris, Shanghai, or Central City.

22:05.061 --> 22:07.329
You were investigating Carver.

22:07.331 --> 22:11.198
He must have found out
their ugly little secret.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.536
What, do they lie on their tax returns?

22:14.538 --> 22:17.004
They bribe their way
into that yacht club?

22:17.006 --> 22:18.105
Enough.

22:18.107 --> 22:19.973
Assume whatever you want about me,

22:19.975 --> 22:23.010
but don't do it about my parents.

22:23.012 --> 22:25.145
They're good people.

22:25.147 --> 22:27.615
Then let me help you.

22:27.617 --> 22:30.918
I barely know you.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.357
You know everything that matters.

22:35.525 --> 22:38.058
For the record,

22:38.060 --> 22:41.465
I didn't enjoy tricking you.

22:43.999 --> 22:47.101
Okay, I enjoyed it.

22:47.103 --> 22:51.939
But, honestly, I felt
pretty crappy afterwards.

22:51.941 --> 22:53.377
Why is that?

22:55.412 --> 22:58.546
'Cause you are a good person...

22:58.548 --> 23:01.281
just like your parents.

23:01.283 --> 23:05.520
You just have some... issues.

23:06.989 --> 23:09.957
You're so decent. It's nauseating.

23:09.959 --> 23:12.159
Oh, boy, you should've seen
me about two years ago.

23:12.161 --> 23:15.162
I was a... I was a real crap-bag.

23:15.164 --> 23:17.965
Actually, you probably would
have liked that, though.

23:17.967 --> 23:19.734
I don't know.

23:19.736 --> 23:23.607
This whole good-guy
thing you got going on...

23:25.174 --> 23:28.543
It's... tolerable.

23:28.545 --> 23:30.412
Tolerable.

23:30.414 --> 23:33.180
Which is why...

23:33.182 --> 23:35.184
I'm giving you this.

23:40.757 --> 23:43.691
Look into that.

23:43.693 --> 23:46.694
You might find something interesting.

23:46.696 --> 23:48.563
I did.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.373
I just talked to Iris.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.241
She said someone tried
to kill Captain West.

24:01.243 --> 24:03.410
Yeah. Joseph Carver.

24:03.412 --> 24:05.112
So what do we do?

24:05.114 --> 24:08.015
Uh, I sent Jenna to stay
with her sister, Joanie,

24:08.017 --> 24:09.216
so we know she's safe.

24:09.218 --> 24:11.753
And, uh...

24:11.755 --> 24:13.253
I don't know.

24:13.255 --> 24:15.122
Cecile, if you're helping Joe

24:15.124 --> 24:17.090
and Carver finds out...

24:17.092 --> 24:20.327
What do you think? He's
gonna come after me, too?

24:20.329 --> 24:23.363
If he does, he'll have to go through me.

24:23.365 --> 24:26.333
Come here.

24:26.335 --> 24:28.335
Me too.

24:28.337 --> 24:30.505
Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear.

24:30.507 --> 24:33.040
But I'm here to help keep everyone safe.

24:33.042 --> 24:34.274
You feel safe?

24:34.276 --> 24:38.078
We're safe. You, not so much.

24:42.652 --> 24:45.787
Allegra. Hey, Allegra.

24:45.789 --> 24:47.044
Come on. Come on.

24:47.046 --> 24:48.623
Hey, what... what can I do to fix this?

24:48.625 --> 24:50.123
'Cause I-I feel terrible.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.125
What about how I feel?

24:52.127 --> 24:55.095
I've been lied to before a lot

24:55.097 --> 24:58.298
by pretty much anyone who's
ever said they cared about me.

24:58.300 --> 25:01.569
And now you expect me to
smile and say it's all okay

25:01.571 --> 25:03.705
because you feel bad?

25:03.707 --> 25:06.073
No, I...

25:06.075 --> 25:09.677
What am I supposed to do?

25:09.679 --> 25:11.579
Walk away.

25:25.662 --> 25:27.662
Great.

25:56.492 --> 25:58.160
Allegra!

26:26.723 --> 26:28.590
It's too much. It's too much.

26:28.592 --> 26:30.557
It's too much pain. It's too much pain.

26:31.795 --> 26:33.226
Aah!

26:37.458 --> 26:40.948
You will bring

26:40.950 --> 26:45.640
so much suffering.

26:50.490 --> 26:54.742
Bare, Rag Doll took
Cecile. He sent this.

26:54.744 --> 26:57.376
So much delicious suffering.

26:57.378 --> 26:59.162
See you soon, Captain.

26:59.164 --> 27:01.162
All right, I-I can track Cecile's phone,

27:01.164 --> 27:02.538
but, Joe, he wants you to find her,

27:02.540 --> 27:04.317
just like he used me to
lure Iris... it's a trap.

27:04.319 --> 27:05.753
If something happens to her, it's on me.

27:05.755 --> 27:06.876
No, we're gonna bring her home.

27:06.878 --> 27:08.668
- But what about your speed?
- Don't worry about my speed.

27:08.670 --> 27:09.893
I'll do whatever I can, all right?

27:09.895 --> 27:12.896
I won't hold back until
she's safe. Let's go.

27:13.929 --> 27:16.897
- You okay?
- I'm okay. I'm good.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.606
Joe, find Cecile. I'll hold him off.

27:26.608 --> 27:28.641
Run, Captain. Run.

27:28.643 --> 27:31.410
Cecile! Cecile!

27:40.522 --> 27:41.889
Babe!

27:51.066 --> 27:52.800
Babe!

27:52.802 --> 27:54.767
Babe. I'm coming.

28:02.744 --> 28:03.778
Okay.

28:08.150 --> 28:11.018
Careful, careful. Don't touch me.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.518
It's a pressure bomb.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.620
If it's not weighted
down, it'll explode.

28:14.622 --> 28:17.657
How do you know that?

28:17.659 --> 28:19.692
He told me to tell you.

28:19.694 --> 28:21.527
Okay.

28:25.167 --> 28:28.501
I see you.

28:28.503 --> 28:30.349
Missed me.

28:30.351 --> 28:31.939
Oh, almost.

28:31.941 --> 28:34.540
Getting closer.

28:47.022 --> 28:50.823
Suffer nice and slow.

29:01.469 --> 29:04.104
Captain West? Rag Doll was here.

29:04.106 --> 29:05.638
Yeah, I know. He took Cecile.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.007
I'm here with her now.

29:07.009 --> 29:09.775
Listen, I need your help
defusing an explosive.

29:09.777 --> 29:11.677
Uh, what kind of a
device is it, Captain?

29:11.679 --> 29:15.581
Uh, it is a Michael 1-1-2

29:15.583 --> 29:17.783
composition Charlie 4

29:17.785 --> 29:19.552
block demolition charge.

29:19.554 --> 29:21.587
C4 block demolition charge.

29:21.589 --> 29:23.123
Yeah. Got it.

29:23.125 --> 29:25.625
Okay, so, easy.

29:25.627 --> 29:28.494
Open the outer panel.
You're gonna see four wires.

29:28.496 --> 29:29.597
Pull the green one.

29:33.168 --> 29:35.202
There are more than four wires,

29:35.204 --> 29:37.603
and they're all green.

29:40.775 --> 29:41.909
I got this.

29:41.911 --> 29:43.944
But how? Captain...

29:43.946 --> 29:45.979
Okay.

29:45.981 --> 29:48.115
Babe...

29:48.117 --> 29:51.784
do you remember dancing
at your cousin's wedding?

29:51.786 --> 29:54.087
what, when you were stepping on my toes

29:54.089 --> 29:55.488
until we finally got in sync?

29:55.490 --> 29:56.957
Yeah, we're gonna do that now.

29:56.959 --> 29:58.125
What? No.

29:58.127 --> 30:00.760
- No.
- We do not have time.

30:00.762 --> 30:02.828
- I can't let you do this.
- Follow me.

30:04.565 --> 30:07.034
- On three, move, okay?
- Okay.

30:07.036 --> 30:11.004
One, two, three!

30:18.047 --> 30:19.745
We lost a minute.

30:41.836 --> 30:44.603
You're not gonna make anyone
suffer anymore, Merkel,

30:44.605 --> 30:46.839
no matter how much
Black Hole's paying you.

30:46.841 --> 30:48.308
Pay?

30:48.310 --> 30:50.943
Don't care about money.

30:50.945 --> 30:53.746
If you're not trying
to kill Joe for money,

30:53.748 --> 30:54.914
why are you doing this?

30:54.916 --> 30:57.317
Oh, release.

30:57.319 --> 30:59.785
Mother's dead. Heart attack.

30:59.787 --> 31:01.954
No one left to suffer now.

31:01.956 --> 31:05.025
Except myself.

31:05.027 --> 31:09.329
Thank you, Flash, for helping me suffer.

31:09.331 --> 31:11.264
Any second now,

31:11.266 --> 31:14.567
release comes with kaboom!

31:24.746 --> 31:27.280
Joe, what did you... what did you do?

31:27.282 --> 31:29.049
What I had to do.

31:29.051 --> 31:30.783
Please get Cecile out of here now.

31:30.785 --> 31:32.185
No, no. I don't want to leave you.

31:32.187 --> 31:34.954
Cecile, please, make
sure that Jenna is safe.

31:34.956 --> 31:36.589
- Joe, I'm not gonna...
- Barry.

31:36.591 --> 31:38.891
Go... now.

31:43.032 --> 31:44.964
Okay.

31:44.966 --> 31:46.866
All right, come on. Let's go.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.208
Barry!

31:55.210 --> 31:57.310
I have to try.

32:47.296 --> 32:49.329
I should go into Witsec.

33:06.474 --> 33:09.074
Federal agents will be here any minute.

33:09.076 --> 33:11.142
They'll be the only ones
who know where you're going.

33:11.144 --> 33:13.011
They'll keep you safe, Joe,

33:13.013 --> 33:15.814
at least till we get this
Carver mess sorted out.

33:15.816 --> 33:18.251
Thank you, David, for everything, man.

33:21.989 --> 33:23.556
Iris isn't answering her phone.

33:23.558 --> 33:25.223
She needs to know this is happening.

33:25.225 --> 33:27.326
They're here.

33:27.328 --> 33:29.930
Ah...

33:33.534 --> 33:36.302
Just... just tell Iris I love her, okay?

33:42.142 --> 33:44.009
Okay, I don't think I can do this.

33:44.011 --> 33:46.545
- Yes. Yes, you can.
- I can't.

33:46.547 --> 33:49.147
- No, I can't.
- Yes, listen.

33:49.149 --> 33:50.516
I have to go.

33:50.518 --> 33:52.585
It's the only way to
keep our family safe.

33:52.587 --> 33:56.489
You just tell little baby Jenna that
her daddy's gonna come home

33:56.491 --> 33:59.090
as soon as he possibly can, okay?

34:03.196 --> 34:06.231
I love you, Cecile Horton.

34:06.233 --> 34:08.266
I love you.

34:08.268 --> 34:10.935
I love you.

34:10.937 --> 34:12.605
Listen, listen.

34:12.607 --> 34:15.373
Iris and I, we're gonna take
down Carver and Black Hole.

34:15.376 --> 34:17.342
And then we're gonna bring you home.

34:17.344 --> 34:20.210
I promise.

34:20.213 --> 34:23.315
- Keep Iris safe.
- I will.

35:45.566 --> 35:49.033
Joe West is out of the way as requested.

35:49.035 --> 35:50.536
Success is assured.

35:50.538 --> 35:52.303
Good.

35:52.305 --> 35:54.172
If anyone's gonna make my
husband pay for what he did,

35:54.174 --> 35:55.741
it's gonna be me.

36:02.650 --> 36:06.217
Looks like Captain Joe West
will no longer be a problem.

36:06.219 --> 36:08.186
Someone else must've
heard the good news, too,

36:08.188 --> 36:10.288
because they sent you a gift.

36:10.290 --> 36:12.627
I had it delivered.

36:33.413 --> 36:35.982
Hello, Joseph.

36:37.452 --> 36:39.685
You're a hard man to get a hold of.

36:39.687 --> 36:41.722
That's on purpose.

36:43.323 --> 36:45.458
Wait.

36:45.460 --> 36:49.728
I just have one little
thing I need from you...

36:49.730 --> 36:51.162
an apology.

36:53.266 --> 36:55.701
Seriously?

36:55.703 --> 36:57.068
That's what this is about?

36:57.070 --> 37:00.104
I wanted to help the world.

37:00.106 --> 37:03.374
Now you're destroying it.

37:03.376 --> 37:05.109
I am keeping it safe.

37:05.111 --> 37:06.712
You let me rot in here

37:06.714 --> 37:09.447
while you took everything I created.

37:09.449 --> 37:11.517
I had a vision for humankind.

37:11.519 --> 37:12.751
So did I!

37:19.760 --> 37:22.828
And now I'm making it a reality.

37:22.830 --> 37:25.566
This is your last chance, Joseph.

37:26.834 --> 37:29.802
Threats are for real people, Eva,

37:29.804 --> 37:33.839
not phantoms, because
that's what you are.

37:33.841 --> 37:36.842
And me...

37:36.844 --> 37:39.645
Darling...

37:39.647 --> 37:41.547
I'm untouchable.

37:57.330 --> 37:59.232
Literally.

38:27.662 --> 38:31.429
I just talked to David.

38:31.431 --> 38:33.431
Is my dad really gone?

38:33.433 --> 38:36.367
I tried calling you.

38:36.369 --> 38:38.303
That's your excuse?

38:38.305 --> 38:40.505
My dad is in witness protection, Barry.

38:40.507 --> 38:42.440
You should've come to get me.

38:42.442 --> 38:45.310
Yeah, Iris, there wasn't enough time.

38:45.312 --> 38:46.645
You're The Flash, Barry.

38:46.647 --> 38:49.414
You can make a second last an hour.

38:49.416 --> 38:51.549
Where is he?

38:51.551 --> 38:53.318
I-I honestly don't know.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.385
When is he coming back?

38:54.387 --> 38:55.721
The second that we catch Carver.

38:55.723 --> 38:57.455
Carver's pockets are lined with...

38:57.457 --> 38:59.390
with politicians and lawmakers, Barry,

38:59.392 --> 39:01.159
not to mention assassins.

39:01.161 --> 39:02.728
It could be years before we catch him.

39:02.730 --> 39:06.665
Iris, I'm so sorry, but
Cecile was almost killed.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.333
And then Joe.

39:08.335 --> 39:10.201
He... he had to leave right away,

39:10.203 --> 39:12.470
or else Carver may come
after Jenna or you next.

39:12.472 --> 39:13.839
Carver already came after me...

39:13.841 --> 39:17.508
And I wasn't here to protect you.

39:17.510 --> 39:21.281
Look, I'm... I'm... I'm trying
to keep this family safe.

39:23.884 --> 39:26.517
I want you to take me to him right now.

39:26.519 --> 39:28.386
I told you I don't know
where he's going.

39:28.388 --> 39:29.445
You don't need to, Barry.

39:29.447 --> 39:31.456
They... they left, what,
like 30 minutes ago?

39:31.458 --> 39:33.659
They're probably still
within a 50-mile radius.

39:33.661 --> 39:36.461
With your speed, you can search
that entire area in seconds.

39:36.463 --> 39:37.979
You know I can't, not anymore.

39:37.981 --> 39:40.365
Can't or won't?

39:40.367 --> 39:42.233
It's not that simple.

39:42.235 --> 39:44.937
- Yes, it is, Barry!
- No, it isn't!

39:44.939 --> 39:47.706
Look, Iris, I'm...
I'm barely hanging on.

39:47.708 --> 39:49.607
I can't catch my breath.

39:49.609 --> 39:51.509
I'm getting dizzy. My feet are numb.

39:51.511 --> 39:52.878
My fingers tingle.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.579
It feels like with every step I take,

39:54.581 --> 39:56.247
I'm getting ripped in two.

39:56.249 --> 39:58.616
All I can think about
is if I'll be fast enough

39:58.618 --> 39:59.846
tomorrow to save another life.

39:59.848 --> 40:01.820
I trusted you, Barry.

40:01.822 --> 40:03.658
Iris...

40:05.325 --> 40:08.727
Now we have something else in common.

40:08.729 --> 40:10.698
We both lost our parents.

40:13.333 --> 40:15.533
I hope that was worth it.

40:21.742 --> 40:25.443
Where are you going? Iris.

40:25.445 --> 40:27.880
I want you to leave.

40:27.882 --> 40:30.949
- You can't be serious.
- Barry, you always do this.

40:30.951 --> 40:32.951
You always make all of these decisions,

40:32.953 --> 40:35.620
and then the rest of us have
to deal with the fallout.

40:35.622 --> 40:38.523
Flashpoint, going into the Speed Force,

40:38.525 --> 40:40.324
taking Nora into the
future, and now this...

40:40.326 --> 40:42.762
- I am done, Barry.
- Iris...

40:42.764 --> 40:43.962
I want you to get out.

40:43.964 --> 40:45.053
Please.

40:45.055 --> 40:46.944
Okay, look, we can work through this.

40:46.946 --> 40:49.567
- You're my home.
- Not anymore.

40:53.339 --> 40:55.841
Leave.

Greg, move your head.
