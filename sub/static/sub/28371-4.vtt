WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.611
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.654 --> 00:04.439
DELILAH: SANCTUM WAS
COLONIZED BY A TEAM FROM EARTH

00:04.482 --> 00:06.310
MADE UP OF 4 FAMILIES--
THE PRIMES.

00:06.354 --> 00:07.659
RUSSELL: WE HAVE THE SAME
BLOOD, CLARKE, ROYAL BLOOD.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.183
THAT'’S WHY THEY
WENT AFTER DELILAH.

00:09.226 --> 00:10.532
MIRANDA: THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
TOOK MY ROSE.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.273
WE KNOW THEY'’RE
STILL HERE.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.014
WE'’LL SEARCH EVERYWHERE
INSIDE THE COMPOUND.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.624
WOULD YOU BE SO CALM IF IT
WAS YOUR DAUGHTER'’S TURN?

00:15.667 --> 00:17.278
I DIDN'’T KNOW
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.236
SHE DIED IN A FALL
6 YEARS AGO.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.977
THERE ARE THINGS
AND PEOPLE IN THESE WOODS
THAT WANT US DEAD.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.587
IF YOU FALL BEHIND,
YOU WILL BE.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.459
MAN: CHILDREN OF GABRIEL,
GATHER ROUND.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.592
-DEATH TO PRIMES!
-DEATH TO PRIMES! DEATH TO...

00:27.636 --> 00:29.681
WE'’VE GOT
THE PRIMES AND THE GUNS.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.161
LET'’S TAKE OUR WIN
AND GO HOME.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.076
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA,
THEY'’LL KILL OUR PEOPLE.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.164
DO NOT ENGAGE.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.644
-UH!
-HYAH!

00:35.687 --> 00:37.167
BELLAMY: YOU'’RE ON YOUR OWN.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.169
OCTAVIA: WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, LEAVE ME HERE?

00:39.213 --> 00:41.171
YEAH, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.433
FINE. SHOULD HAVE
DIED IN THAT GORGE, ANYWAY.

00:59.581 --> 01:05.152
DON'’T WORRY.
I'’LL SHOW YOU HOW.

01:05.195 --> 01:07.632
IMPROVISE, ADAPT.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.202
OVERCOME.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.727
GOOD THING
THERE'’S NO MARINES LEFT.

01:15.771 --> 01:18.426
I'’D NEVER HEAR THE END
OF IT FOR STEALING THAT.

01:18.469 --> 01:21.168
COCKY BASTARDS.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.183
ANYONE EVER TEACH YOU
IT'’S RUDE

01:36.226 --> 01:38.185
TO SHINE A LIGHT
IN SOMEONE'’S FACE?

01:38.228 --> 01:40.361
YOU SHOULD BE
MORE WORRIED ABOUT
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.276
DIYOZA: YOU'’RE GONNA
NEED MORE THAN 3 PEOPLE

01:42.319 --> 01:44.408
TO TAKE ME OUT.

01:44.452 --> 01:47.150
YOUR BABY NEEDS
A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.283
I CAN OFFER
YOU THAT.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.632
I'’M LISTENING.

01:50.675 --> 01:53.200
HELP US RETURN
THE CHILD--ROSE--

01:53.243 --> 01:55.158
AND THE 3 HEADS OF
OUR FALLEN PRIMES,

01:55.202 --> 01:57.334
AND RUSSELL PRIME--
HALLOWED BE HIS NAME--

01:57.378 --> 01:59.162
WILL LET YOUR CHILD
BE RAISED IN SANCTUM.

01:59.206 --> 02:02.209
MY CHILD BUT NOT ME.

02:02.252 --> 02:05.255
THAT'’S THE OFFER.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

02:08.389 --> 02:12.393
LET ME GUESS.
THE KID'’S YOURS.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.699
NOT EXACTLY.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.789
IT'’S MY DUTY TO
SERVE AND PROTECT

02:17.833 --> 02:19.269
THE NEXT PRIME.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.706
BODYGUARD. GOT IT.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.145
BANG-UP JOB YOU DID THERE.

02:26.842 --> 02:31.238
YOU KNOW, I, UM,
RETRIEVED THIS

02:31.281 --> 02:32.717
TAKEN FROM YOUR
BELONGINGS.

02:32.761 --> 02:35.198
THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK
ROSE NOW HAVE GUNS,

02:35.242 --> 02:36.591
AND SO WILL YOU.

02:40.464 --> 02:44.164
SO DO WE HAVE
A DEAL OR NOT?

02:44.207 --> 02:46.253
ONE CONDITION.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.517
I GET A BIKE.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.262
YES. THIS ONE'’S
READY, TOO.

03:39.306 --> 03:42.483
YOU THINK THEY'’VE
HARMED HER?

03:42.526 --> 03:47.314
JADE WILL BRING ROSE
BACK TO US.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.489
AND UNTIL
SHE DOES, I WISH

03:48.532 --> 03:50.404
YOU'’D RECONSIDER
CANCELING NAMING DAY.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.710
THE SHIELD IS UP.
THEY WON'’T GET BACK IN.

03:52.754 --> 03:55.235
I'’M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT'’S OUTSIDE.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.716
THEY HAD SKETCHES.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.197
THEY KNEW
EXACTLY WHO TO TARGET
AND WHERE THEY LIVED.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.372
WE NEED TO TELL
THE PEOPLE

04:02.416 --> 04:03.765
SO THAT THEY
CAN BE ON GUARD.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.288
WE NEED TO ACCEPT
THAT THEY HAVE SPIES

04:05.332 --> 04:06.724
INSIDE SANCTUM.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.422
WE LOST 3 PRIMES.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.902
THEY TOOK ROSE,
ATTACKED DELILAH.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.469
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO?

04:12.513 --> 04:14.297
WE BOTH KNOW THAT THAT
TIMING WAS NO COINCIDENCE.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.256
THEY KNEW TODAY
WAS NAMING DAY.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.868
CANCEL, RUSSELL.
PRIYA CAN WAIT.

04:19.911 --> 04:22.697
WOULD YOU SAY THAT IF
IT WAS JOSEPHINE?

04:24.525 --> 04:29.399
YEAH. IF WE CANCEL,
GABRIEL WINS.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.358
SIMONE: WE DON'’T EVEN
KNOW IF HE'’S ALIVE.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.751
HIS CAUSE CLEARLY IS.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.930
I'’LL POST EXTRA GUARDS
AROUND DELILAH

04:38.974 --> 04:40.715
JUST TO BE SAFE.

04:40.758 --> 04:44.371
FINE. BUT NOT TOO CLOSE.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.330
IT'’S HER DAY, AND I WON'T
HAVE IT RUINED BY FEAR.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.651
MY PARENTS WOULD'’VE
LOVED IT HERE.

05:03.694 --> 05:07.872
HEY. IT'’S MY NAMING DAY.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.965
UNBURDEN. THAT'’S
WHAT WE DO TODAY.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.403
ON NAMING DAY,
WE MAKE AMENDS

05:16.446 --> 05:17.926
FOR THE THINGS WE FEEL
GUILTY FOR.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.884
OK.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.584
I TOLD YOU ABOUT

05:23.627 --> 05:25.412
HOW I SPENT MY WHOLE
LIFE ON THE SHIP.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.588
MM-HMM.

05:27.631 --> 05:32.506
ALL THAT TIME,
IT WAS JUST US...

05:33.768 --> 05:35.987
AND FACES BEHIND GLASS,

05:36.031 --> 05:38.642
PEOPLE I COULDN'’T
TALK TO,

05:38.686 --> 05:42.429
FRIENDS I COULDN'’T HAVE.

05:42.472 --> 05:46.520
I WANTED TO KNOW THEM
SO BADLY. I WANTED...

05:48.826 --> 05:50.306
THIS.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.831
WHEN I DECIDED TO
GO INTO CRYO,

05:53.875 --> 05:57.705
MY PARENTS SAID
THEY UNDERSTOOD,

05:57.748 --> 06:02.579
EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT I'’D
NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.932
ALL PARENTS HAVE TO LET
THEIR KIDS GO SOMETIME.

06:07.976 --> 06:11.762
EXCEPT THEY WEREN'’T
LETTING ME GO

06:11.806 --> 06:15.940
'’CAUSE
I WASN'’T GONE.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.858
I BECAME THE FACE
BEHIND THE GLASS.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.427
I TAUNTED THEM,

06:24.471 --> 06:27.038
AND I FEEL GUILTY

06:27.082 --> 06:29.389
BECAUSE IT BROUGHT
ME HERE...

06:31.521 --> 06:33.305
TO YOU.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.353
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

06:39.094 --> 06:44.578
WE SHOULD TAKE HAPPINESS
WHILE WE CAN.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.537
AHH. WON'’T YOU BE LATE?

06:47.581 --> 06:50.497
OHH, I'’LL MAKE AMENDS.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.592
I'’LL TAKE THAT.
THANK YOU.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.947
THAT'’S BEAUTIFUL.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.601
WITHOUT YOU,

07:07.644 --> 07:09.646
NONE OF THIS WOULD'’VE
BEEN POSSIBLE TODAY.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.474
TO THE GREAT HALL.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.695
QUICKLY. AND BE CAREFUL.
THAT'’S SIMONE'S FAVORITE.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.610
WHAT'’S
GOING ON?

07:16.653 --> 07:17.872
I THINK IT'’S SOME
SORT OF CELEBRATION.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.917
"WHAT'’S GOING ON"!
IT'’S NAMING DAY.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.398
AND YOU'’RE
THE GUESTS OF HONOR.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.058
JAE: HA HA HA! I KNOW.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.973
A GOOD COOKIE CAN CHANGE
YOUR LIFE.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.844
WOMAN: THERE SHE IS!
HERE'’S DELILAH!

07:38.936 --> 07:41.461
WOMAN: YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL, DELILAH.

07:44.681 --> 07:45.813
MY HERO.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.078
-HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
-I FEEL GREAT.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.515
CILLIAN: I'’LL BE THE JUDGE
OF THAT.

07:52.559 --> 07:56.563
THIS WAY. LET'’S HAVE
A LOOK AT YOU. YOU, TOO.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.738
LET'’S GO.

08:04.875 --> 08:08.139
MMM! MMM!
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.620
YOU RECOVERED FAST.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.535
MMM. I KNOW.
A GOOD NIGHT'’S SLEEP.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.755
SLEEP, HUH? IS THAT
WHAT THEY CALL IT HERE?

08:14.798 --> 08:17.932
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

08:17.975 --> 08:19.629
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

08:25.766 --> 08:29.900
PRIYA I.
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.772
YOU'’RE THE PILOT,
RIGHT?

08:31.815 --> 08:32.947
YEAH.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.992
I THINK YOU'’LL LIKE HER.

08:35.036 --> 08:37.647
THEY HAD MOTORCYCLES?

08:37.691 --> 08:39.997
STILL DO. THE MACHINE SHOPS
KEPT THEM RUNNING

08:40.041 --> 08:41.782
FOR OVER 200 YEARS.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.131
JOSIAH: COMING THROUGH!

08:43.174 --> 08:44.611
JOSIAH,
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT.

08:44.654 --> 08:45.916
WAIT. WHERE'’S
THE MACHINE SHOP?

08:45.960 --> 08:48.615
LAST QUESTION:
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER

08:48.658 --> 08:50.791
FROM WHEN YOU WERE
PARALYZED?

08:50.834 --> 08:52.923
ONLY EVERYTHING.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.012
WELL, DON'’T WORRY.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.014
AFTER TONIGHT, IT'’LL
BE LIKE IT NEVER
HAPPENED AT ALL.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.581
YOU'’RE GOOD.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.757
DELILAH: THANK YOU.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.194
NOW FOR YOU.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.718
I TOLD YOU, I'’M FINE.

09:04.761 --> 09:08.765
WELL, I TOLD YOUR MOTHER
I'’D MAKE SURE OF THAT.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.594
DAMN. I'’M GOOD.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.771
SHE'’S FAIRLY INTENSE--
YOUR MOTHER.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.513
I GRANTED HER ACCESS
TO OUR MEDICAL LIBRARY,

09:17.557 --> 09:20.560
AND I'’M TOLD
SHE ASKED FOR A BED
TO BE BROUGHT IN.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.823
YOU BEST KEEP
THIS COVERED...

09:22.866 --> 09:25.042
UNLESS YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO WORSHIP YOU.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.567
YEAH. THAT WOULD SUCK.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.573
I HOPE I SEE YOU LATER.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.755
HE'’S CUTE.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.757
STOP.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.586
SO IS THIS WHAT IT'’LL
BE LIKE FROM NOW ON?

09:46.629 --> 09:47.935
WHY NOT?

09:47.978 --> 09:51.068
I THINK WE DESERVE
A FRESH START,
DON'’T YOU?

09:51.112 --> 09:53.854
DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN GO TO SCHOOL?

09:53.897 --> 09:55.246
NO, MADI.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.249
-CLARKE.
-HEY, WE'’VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.773
YOU CHOSE TO BE
COMMANDER.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.252
THAT COMES WITH
RESPONSIBILITIES.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.080
WHAT DO YOU THINK'’S
GONNA HAPPEN?

10:03.124 --> 10:05.692
NO ONE'’S GONNA FIND OUT
I'’M A NIGHTBLOOD.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.694
QUIET. NOW, GAIA'’S
WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE SHIP

10:07.737 --> 10:09.086
WITH MILLER AND JACKSON.

10:09.130 --> 10:12.133
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT
SHEIDHEDA.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.918
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
STEP DOWN, RIGHT?

10:14.962 --> 10:16.703
TAKE OUT THE FLAME?

10:16.746 --> 10:18.269
NO ONE WOULD BLAME YOU.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.836
I WILL.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.972
I'’LL GO TRAIN.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.800
BLYTHE ANN: COME, EVERYONE.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.063
WE DON'’T WANT TO MISS
THE OPENING CEREMONY.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.113
MURPHY AND EMORI?

10:36.157 --> 10:37.898
JORDAN: WENT TO GUARD
THE SHIP WITH THE OTHERS.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.030
ECHO: MURPHY MISSING A CHANCE
TO ACT LIKE A DRUNKEN FOOL?

10:40.074 --> 10:41.771
NOW I'’M WORRIED.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.730
HE'’LL BE FINE.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.688
MAYBE THE REST OF US
SHOULD GO THERE, TOO.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.996
JORDAN: WHAT? NO.
I NEED THIS.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.606
CLARKE: WE'’RE GUESTS
OF THE PRIMES.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.695
IF WE ISOLATE OURSELVES
ON THE SHIP,

10:52.739 --> 10:54.001
THEY MAY TAKE OFFENSE.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.960
JORDAN?
GUYS, COME ON.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.013
RAVEN: I'’LL BE AT THE BAR.

11:09.756 --> 11:13.673
DELILAH: COME ON! YOU DON'’T
WANT TO MISS FIRST CONFESSION.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.766
YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.041
WELCOME TO NAMING DAY.

11:35.869 --> 11:39.176
TODAY WE OBSERVE
THE 4 PILLARS OF SANCTUM.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.917
THEY ARE?

11:40.961 --> 11:45.182
SPECTATORS: REPENT, RENEW,
REJOICE, REBIRTH.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.228
RUSSELL: CORRECT. REBIRTH.

11:47.271 --> 11:50.187
REBIRTH!

11:50.231 --> 11:53.756
TODAY WE MARK THE RETURN
OF OUR BELOVED PRIYA...

11:53.800 --> 11:55.236
SPECTATORS:
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.020
RUSSELL: INDEED.

11:57.064 --> 12:01.938
AS WE BEQUEATH HER NAME TO OUR
EQUALLY BELOVED DELILAH.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.774
AS IS TRADITION
WITH EVERY NAMING DAY,

12:11.818 --> 12:15.299
I WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF
MAKING AMENDS.

12:15.343 --> 12:20.391
AS YOUR LEADER, IT'’S MY JOB
TO KEEP US SAFE

12:20.435 --> 12:22.306
DURING THE RED SUN.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.788
KAYLEE...

12:25.832 --> 12:28.399
I FAILED YOU IN THIS

12:28.443 --> 12:30.010
WHEN I REALIZED YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY

12:30.053 --> 12:31.751
DIDN'’T MAKE IT
TO RYKER'’S KEEP

12:31.794 --> 12:32.926
BEFORE THE ECLIPSE.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.841
I CLOSED THE DOOR.

12:34.884 --> 12:38.018
I KEPT IT OPEN
AS LONG AS I COULD

12:38.061 --> 12:41.412
UNTIL THE LIFE OF
EVERYONE ELSE WAS
AT RISK.

12:41.456 --> 12:46.809
IT WAS A DECISION
WITH TRAGIC
CONSEQUENCES.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.420
I KNOW THE
HEARTBREAK YOU FEEL.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.771
I KNOW YOUR PAIN.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.950
I MISS JOSEPHINE EVERY DAY.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.783
AND THE FACT THAT I'’M THE
CAUSE OF THIS PAIN FOR YOU...

13:15.229 --> 13:17.448
THANK YOU.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.022
RUSSELL:
AND NOW IT'’S YOUR TURN.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.024
TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR THAT
YOU LOVE THEM.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.853
MAKE AMENDS FOR THOSE
YOU'’VE HURT.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.986
FREE YOURSELVES.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.389
HEY. CAN I TALK TO YOU?

13:47.870 --> 13:51.091
LET ME GUESS. I'’M
THE FIRST STOP ON
THE APOLOGY TOUR?

13:51.134 --> 13:54.181
RAVEN, LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.098
I'’M SORRY...

13:58.141 --> 14:00.013
FOR THE GORGE,

14:00.056 --> 14:04.452
FOR MCCREARY
AND HIS ARMY, FOR SHAW.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.323
SHUT UP.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.064
KEEP HIM OUT OF THIS.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.240
HE WANTED YOU TO BE
HAPPY, RAVEN.

14:10.284 --> 14:15.071
HIS LAST WORDS WERE
THAT YOU DESERVED HAPPINESS.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.204
YOU TURNED US IN.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.336
GOOD PEOPLE DIED
BECAUSE OF YOU.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.338
SHAW WAS TORTURED...

14:21.382 --> 14:23.384
BECAUSE OF YOU.

14:28.171 --> 14:31.000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:31.044 --> 14:34.961
YOUR PROBLEM ISN'’T
MAKING AMENDS, CLARKE.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.311
EVERY TIME THAT YOU DO
SOMETHING HORRIBLE,

14:37.354 --> 14:40.053
YOU SAY YOU'’RE SORRY.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.446
AND THEN YOU DO IT
AGAIN.

14:42.490 --> 14:46.363
CLARKE GRIFFIN AND HER
IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.149
AT LEAST HAVE THE BALLS
TO STAND BY THEM.

14:49.192 --> 14:53.022
BELLAMY, THE GUY
THAT YOU LEFT TO DIE
IN A FIGHTING PIT,

14:53.066 --> 14:55.155
LEFT HIS OWN SISTER
TO DIE IN THE WOODS

14:55.198 --> 14:58.158
BECAUSE SHE WAS
A THREAT TO EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE

14:58.201 --> 14:59.942
SHE COMES
INTO CONTACT WITH.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.901
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.947
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND HER

15:04.991 --> 15:08.385
IS OCTAVIA DOESN'’T
PRETEND TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT IT.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.307
TOSH: STOP LYING.
WE KNOW THE ONE CALLED
CLARKE IS A HOST.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.571
-TAKE IT EASY.
-SHUT UP. SHE'’S GONNA TALK.

15:20.615 --> 15:21.572
HOW MANY MORE BLACK BLOODS
CAME WITH YOU?

15:21.616 --> 15:23.183
-NO.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.141
SO HELP ME, GOD, XAVIER,

15:25.185 --> 15:27.056
IF YOU SAY THE OLD MAN
WOULDN'’T APPROVE ONE MO--

15:27.100 --> 15:29.015
NO, HE
WOULD NOT.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.364
HE'’S RIGHT. THE OLD MAN
WILL GET HER TO TALK
ONCE WE GET BACK.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.974
TOSH: THE OLD MAN WON'’T
EVEN TALK TO US.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.976
WE DON'’T EVEN KNOW
IF HE'’S ALIVE.

15:34.020 --> 15:34.977
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,

15:35.021 --> 15:36.413
WALK INTO THE ANOMALY
TO FIND HIM?

15:36.457 --> 15:40.548
I'’M NOT. ARE YOU?

15:40.591 --> 15:43.116
HOW ABOUT YOU,
ERRAND BOY?

15:43.159 --> 15:44.900
I DIDN'’T THINK SO.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.207
NO MORE WALKING.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.425
WE BURN THE HEADS,
AND WE KILL THE HOST CHILD
AND THE EARTH GIRL

15:48.469 --> 15:50.123
SO WE CAN GET--

15:52.255 --> 15:53.996
YOU'’RE GONNA SHOOT ME NOW?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.606
I'’D REALLY
RATHER NOT.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.913
THE REST OF
OUR UNIT IS
EXPECTING YOU.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.223
MOVE OUT!

16:13.059 --> 16:14.451
YOU'’RE WELCOME.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.323
UH!

16:18.281 --> 16:21.023
TALK TO THEM, PLEASE.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.982
THEY'’LL KILL
US IF YOU DON'’T.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.244
I WON'’T LET THAT
HAPPEN.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.028
BUT THEY'’RE MONSTERS.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.206
SO AM I.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.170
WOMAN: LOOK LIVELY.
THEY SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.492
MM-MM.

16:55.536 --> 16:58.974
GO ON. IT TASTES BETTER
THAN IT LOOKS.

17:00.628 --> 17:04.066
SHE SAID NO.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.199
YOU'’VE GOT A GRATITUDE
PROBLEM, YOU KNOW THAT?

17:06.242 --> 17:08.244
WOMAN: THEY'’RE HERE!

17:08.288 --> 17:10.594
DEATH TO PRIMES.

17:10.638 --> 17:14.033
STAY QUIET, AND MAYBE
YOU'’LL LIVE.

17:14.076 --> 17:17.427
XAVIER: OH, AND YOU'’LL
TEAR THROUGH
YOUR RADIAL ARTERY

17:17.471 --> 17:20.126
BEFORE YOU TEAR
THROUGH THAT ROPE.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.518
MAN: YOUR SCOUT TOLD US
THAT YOU HAD 3 PRIMES

17:21.562 --> 17:22.650
AT THE POST.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.391
TOSH: YES. SHE'’S A CHILD.

17:24.434 --> 17:27.089
XAVIER WANTED TO KEEP
HER ALIVE AS A LITTLE PET.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.700
I SAY SHE DIES NOW.

17:29.744 --> 17:33.356
SHH. YOU'’LL BE
WITH YOUR FRIENDS SOON.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.318
MAN ON RECORDING:
ON NAMING DAY,

17:38.361 --> 17:40.102
BY THE LIGHT
OF THE TWO SUNS,

17:40.146 --> 17:43.149
WE REVEAL THE DARKNESS
OF OUR PAST...

17:52.375 --> 17:54.247
GIRL: THE LIGHTING
LOOKS NICE.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.422
-SO CUTE...
-YEAH...

17:57.598 --> 17:59.643
APPARENTLY,
THE LANTERNS FLOAT,

17:59.687 --> 18:01.732
TAKING YOUR SINS WITH THEM.

18:01.776 --> 18:05.214
HMM. IF ONLY
IT WERE THAT EASY.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.086
MAYBE IT IS.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.090
I WROTE DOWN
"LEAVING YOU IN POLIS."

18:11.133 --> 18:13.657
CLARKE, STOP.
LET'’S NOT DO THIS.

18:15.268 --> 18:19.446
WHAT I DID--LEAVING YOU
LIKE THAT--

18:23.189 --> 18:25.104
I'’M SO SORRY, BELLAMY.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.198
I KNOW WHAT IT'’S LIKE
TO RISK EVERYTHING

18:32.241 --> 18:33.547
FOR ONE PERSON.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.592
I KNOW MADI'’S YOUR
FAMILY.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.160
HEY.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.554
YOU ARE MY FAMILY, TOO.

18:40.597 --> 18:43.209
I LOST SIGHT OF THAT.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.299
BUT I PROMISE I WILL
NEVER FORGET IT AGAIN.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.129
YOU'’RE TOO IMPORTANT TO ME.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.741
CLARKE.

19:02.402 --> 19:05.100
CLARKE: ARE YOU
GONNA TRY IT?

19:05.144 --> 19:08.364
AHH. TOO MANY SINS. MY
LANTERN WOULDN'’T FLOAT.

19:08.408 --> 19:11.193
OCTAVIA?

19:12.673 --> 19:14.196
NO MORE AMENDS TODAY.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.285
OK.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.638
MAN: WE'’VE DEBATED
LONG ENOUGH.

19:21.682 --> 19:24.337
I AGREE WITH TOSH.
KILL THE BLACK BLOOD.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.642
ONE LESS NAMING DAY TO STOP.

19:25.686 --> 19:28.341
YOU GONNA SHOOT
HIM NOW, TOO?

19:28.384 --> 19:30.125
XAVIER: I'’LL SAY IT AGAIN.
WE SAVE THEM.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.431
WE DON'’T KILL THEM.
YOU DON'’T KNOW THAT.

19:31.474 --> 19:32.736
BUT FINE. YOU CAN TELL
THE OLD MAN

19:32.780 --> 19:34.390
WE'’VE BECOME MURDERERS.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.392
MAN: HEY.
TOSH: THEY'’RE GONE!

19:36.436 --> 19:38.438
MAN: OH, NO.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.613
XAVIER: HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.354
MAN: BRING THEM BACK ALIVE!

19:44.313 --> 19:45.793
MAN: FIND '’EM!

20:25.746 --> 20:27.835
OK. COME ON.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.490
START.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.753
COME ON. UH!

20:32.796 --> 20:35.930
LOVER'’S SPAT?

20:38.759 --> 20:40.369
YEAH. WE'’LL WORK IT OUT.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.850
SOUNDS LIKE
A FUEL INTAKE PROBLEM.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.331
VERY GOOD.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.723
YOU MIND?

20:46.767 --> 20:47.811
PLEASE.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.338
I'’VE HAD MY FAIR SHARE
OF FIGHTS

20:52.381 --> 20:54.296
WITH CRANKY ENGINES.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.645
WHAT'’S YOUR PROPELLANT?

20:55.689 --> 20:58.735
UH, ETHANOL, DISTILLED
FROM EARTH CORN.

20:58.779 --> 21:02.304
WE JUST LET THIS ONE
SIT TOO LONG.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.306
IT'’S MY MOTHER'S.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.829
SHE TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW,

21:05.873 --> 21:08.267
SO I FIGURED IT WAS THE LEAST
I COULD DO FOR HER TODAY.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.749
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'’RE MISSING
A HELL OF A PARTY.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.274
YEAH. SOMEBODY JUST
OPENED THE PALACE.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.884
FIRST WE PARTY,
THEN WE PRAY.

21:16.927 --> 21:19.234
NOT REALLY MY SCENE.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.758
BESIDES, IT'’S NICE TO
BE ALONE FOR A CHANGE.

21:23.891 --> 21:25.849
UM, WELL, YEAH, I'’LL
LEAVE YOU TO IT, THEN.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.634
OH, I DIDN'’T MEAN YOU.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.594
-RYKER.
-RAVEN.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.335
OMEN OF DEATH. COOL.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.555
ACTUALLY, THAT'’S
A MISCONCEPTION.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.514
I HOPE SO.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.429
LISTEN, I COULD USE
THE HANDS THAT GO
WITH THAT BRAIN, SO...

21:40.473 --> 21:41.778
STAY HERE, OK?

21:53.486 --> 21:57.968
MAN: ♪ SEASICK

21:58.012 --> 22:03.365

WHAT'’S WRONG?

23:08.822 --> 23:11.041
SO THE LAST TIME I WAS
AT A PARTY,

23:11.085 --> 23:13.392
MY SISTER WAS ARRESTED.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.785
BELLAMY, IF YOU'’RE GONNA
TEAR YOURSELF APART

23:15.829 --> 23:17.657
OVER LEAVING HER,
LET'’S GO GET HER.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.876
NO, THIS ISN'’T ME TEARING
MYSELF APART, OK?

23:19.920 --> 23:21.443
THIS IS ME BEING HUMAN--

23:21.487 --> 23:24.664
FEELING THINGS
WHEN PEOPLE I LOVE

23:24.707 --> 23:26.448
ARE IN TROUBLE OR DIE.

23:26.492 --> 23:29.973
THE ECHO I KNEW
ON THE RING DID THAT.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.411
WHY DON'’T YOU?

23:32.454 --> 23:34.456
THIS ISN'’T ABOUT ME.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.460
NO? WE LOST MONTY
AND HARPER 3 DAYS AGO.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.070
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

23:40.114 --> 23:43.422
'’CAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.599
I LOST MY SISTER YESTERDAY.

23:46.642 --> 23:49.515
IT'’S GONNA TAKE ME A LITTLE
WHILE TO FEEL NOTHING,

23:49.558 --> 23:50.994
LIKE A GOOD AZGEDA SPY.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.649
BUT I'’LL KEEP TRYING.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.623
COME ON.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.799
I CAN'’T, MOMMY.
NO MORE.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.714
ROSE, THEY'’RE TRYING
TO KILL US.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.542
IF YOU STOP, YOU DIE.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.848
WOMAN: EVERYBODY, SPLIT UP!
SPREAD OUT!

24:18.892 --> 24:22.112
ROSE, LISTEN TO ME.
I KNOW YOU'’RE SCARED.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.723
BUT FEAR IS A DEMON.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.551
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST
TELL YOURSELF

24:25.594 --> 24:27.074
YOU'’RE NOT AFRAID.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.641
I'’M NOT AFRAID.

24:28.684 --> 24:31.687
GOOD. GOOD. SEE? THAT'’S
HOW YOU SLAY THE DEMON.

24:31.731 --> 24:33.559
SO NO MATTER WHAT YOU
HEAR, YOU KEEP
YOUR EYES CLOSED,

24:33.602 --> 24:36.039
AND YOU KEEP
SAYING IT, OK? DO IT.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.955
I'’M NOT AFRAID.
I'’M NOT AFRAID.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.522
WOMAN: I SEE THEM!
OCTAVIA: COME ON.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.786
I'’M TAKING YOU HOME,
I PROMISE.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.833
I'’M NOT AFRAID.
I'’M NOT AFRAID.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.530
-DON'’T MOVE.
-FREEZE! THERE THEY ARE.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.054
GO! SURROUND THEM!

25:11.205 --> 25:12.511
NICE STICK.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.905
ROSE, OH, THANK GOD.

25:15.949 --> 25:18.168
NOT YET. MAKE SURE
THEY'’RE ALL DEAD.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.040
JADE: THEY'’RE NOT.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.565
NO. THAT ONE'’S MINE.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.480
-UH!
-UH!

25:30.050 --> 25:31.965
JADE: NO!

25:55.684 --> 25:58.687
I SUPPOSE OUR DEAL
IS OFF.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.606
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING NOW?

26:04.650 --> 26:06.652
ONE OF THEM WASN'’T HERE.

26:06.695 --> 26:10.612
I'’M GONNA FIND HIM,
AND I'’M GONNA KILL HIM.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.658
WAS HE THEIR LEADER?

26:12.701 --> 26:14.660
NO. THEIR LEADER IS
SOME OLD MAN WHO--

26:14.703 --> 26:17.227
YOU SAW HIM,
THE OLD MAN?

26:17.271 --> 26:18.794
OCTAVIA: NO.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.883
FROM WHAT I HEARD,
THEY DON'’T EVEN KNOW

26:20.927 --> 26:22.842
IF HE'’S DEAD OR ALIVE.

26:22.885 --> 26:26.585
BUT IF HE IS ALIVE
AND I KILL HIM...

26:26.628 --> 26:28.064
THE PRIMES
WILL HONOR THE DEAL.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.763
I'’M SURE OF IT.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.721
THEN CONSIDER IT DONE.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.638
GOOD LUCK.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.912
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
A PARTNER.

26:51.784 --> 26:54.874
COME ON. I'’LL TEACH YOU
HOW TO RIDE THIS THING.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.658
WE KILL SOME TERRORISTS.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.573
THE DEVILS FROM EARTH
BECOME

26:58.617 --> 26:59.879
THE HEROES OF SANCTUM.

26:59.922 --> 27:00.967
EASY PEASY.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.187
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

27:10.759 --> 27:12.718
I'’M IN.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.284
DRESS LIKE
THE ENEMY. SMART.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.982
SHUT UP.

27:16.025 --> 27:19.594
SEE? THE BEGINNING OF
A BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP.

27:23.206 --> 27:24.904
OK.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.775
AH. YOU GOT
IT STARTED.

27:26.819 --> 27:29.996
I GUESS YOU'’RE PRETTY
PROUD OF YOURSELF.

27:33.347 --> 27:35.131
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A MECHANIC.

27:35.175 --> 27:39.875
I AM, BUT I'’M ALSO A PRIME
WHO'’S LATE FOR THE NAMING.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.619
WE SHOULD TAKE HER OUT
SOMETIME.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.841
DON'’T TELL ME YOU
DON'’T RIDE.

27:48.884 --> 27:51.713
NO, NOT YET,
BUT I'’M SURE
I CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.846
OF THAT I HAVE NO DOUBT.

27:53.889 --> 27:54.977
WELL, FOR NOW, GO CLEAN UP.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.718
WE'’LL HEAD TO THE PALACE.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.154
IT'’S TIME FOR
THAT GOOD WINE.

27:58.198 --> 28:00.635
OH, I CAN PROBABLY
GET YOU ON THE LIST.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.290
WOMAN OVER P.A.: FOR THE GLORY
AND GREATNESS OF PRIMES,

28:03.333 --> 28:06.032
THE MEETING IS
ABOUT TO BEGIN...

28:09.905 --> 28:11.733
SHOULDN'’T WE BE
DOWN THERE?

28:11.777 --> 28:13.822
I'’M EXACTLY WHERE
I SHOULD BE.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.714
GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.685
RISE.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.775
DELILAH JANICE WORKMAN,

28:53.819 --> 28:56.212
YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN,
LIKE EACH OF US,

28:56.256 --> 28:59.912
TO RECEIVE THE GREAT
MIRACLE OF THE SANCTUM.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.783
DO YOU ACCEPT
THIS HONOR?

29:01.827 --> 29:03.785
YES, HOLINESS, I DO.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.787
RUSSELL: VERY WELL.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.789
THEN COME FORWARD
AND BE SO NAMED.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.730
DELILAH: KISS ME.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.776
SPECTATORS: AW.

29:40.039 --> 29:42.911
DON'’T LET ME BE A FACE
BEHIND THE GLASS.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.388
IS IT OVER?

30:26.912 --> 30:28.435
NOT YET.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.263
SORRY IF I WOKE YOU.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.004
I'’M NOT.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.059
GOD. IT'’S
BEAUTIFUL HERE.

30:44.103 --> 30:47.497
UNTIL AN HOUR BEFORE
THE DEVIL FELL,

30:47.541 --> 30:50.239
GOD THOUGHT HIM
BEAUTIFUL IN HEAVEN.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.199
IT'’S FROM "THE CRUCIBLE."

30:53.242 --> 30:55.984
IT'’S GABRIEL'S
FAVORITE PLAY.

30:56.028 --> 30:59.509
BANNED BY THE PRIMES,
SO DON'’T QUOTE ME.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.903
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

31:01.947 --> 31:05.428
WELL, I...SUPPOSE
IT MEANS THAT

31:05.472 --> 31:08.954
THERE'’S TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.086
SO TELL ME THE OTHER SIDE.

31:15.090 --> 31:19.007
LET'’S JUST SAY THAT NOT
EVERYONE IN SANCTUM

31:19.051 --> 31:21.009
BELIEVES IN THE DIVINITY
OF THE PRIMES.

31:22.576 --> 31:24.273
DIVINITY.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.022
I HAVE TO SEE THIS.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.481
IT'’S A HOBBY.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.008
YOU'’LL HAVE
TO FORGIVE ME.

32:03.051 --> 32:06.489
NEW FACES
ARE SO MUCH MORE
INTERESTING TO DRAW.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.101
YOU'’RE WONDERING WHY
I CIRCLED YOURS.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.105
I'’M GUESSING IT'S BECAUSE
OF MY BLOOD.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.585
VERY GOOD. YOU CAN
SAVE ME SOME TIME

32:15.629 --> 32:17.326
AND TELL ME HOW MANY
OTHERS ARE LIKE YOU.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.459
NONE. NOW, IF
YOU'’LL EXCUSE ME--

32:19.502 --> 32:21.200
CLARKE.

32:21.243 --> 32:23.028
I'’M NOT THE ONE THAT
YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID OF.

32:23.071 --> 32:25.117
THEN GET OUT OF MY WAY.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.945
CLARKE, LISTEN TO ME!

32:29.469 --> 32:31.340
UH!

32:33.255 --> 32:35.431
WOMAN: MIRANDA VIII.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.958
DON'’T WORRY. IT'S
A TEMPORARY PARALYTIC.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.007
BY THE TIME WE GET YOU TO
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL,

32:46.051 --> 32:47.966
YOU'’LL BE FINE.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.229
RUSSELL: IT IS MY GREAT
HONOR TO PRESENT

32:50.272 --> 32:54.276
PRIYA, SEVENTH OF HER LINE.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.017
CROWD: HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.628
RUSSELL: AND NOW THROUGH FIRE,
WE PURIFY SANCTUM

32:58.672 --> 33:00.979
AND RELEASE OUR SINS.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.474
DELILAH, HEY.

33:32.097 --> 33:35.187
MY BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY.

33:44.152 --> 33:47.286
I WONDER HOW MANY OF THEM
WROTE DOWN "MURDER."

33:47.329 --> 33:50.071
I KNOW YOU'’RE SCARED.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.160
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
WON'’T HURT YOU.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.683
HOPEFULLY, THIS GEL
WILL KEEP ME ALIVE
LONG ENOUGH

33:53.727 --> 33:56.469
TO GET ME THROUGH
THE RADIATION SHIELD.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.427
IF MY DEATH CAN PUT
AN END TO THE PRIMES,

33:58.471 --> 34:00.168
THEN IT'’S WORTH IT.

34:02.649 --> 34:05.086
GOING SOMEWHERE?

34:05.130 --> 34:08.263
CILLIAN: YOU CAN'’T
LET THEM HAVE ANOTHER HOST.
I'’M SORRY, CLARKE.

34:08.307 --> 34:10.352
GUARD: STOP HIM NOW.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.615
GOOD. NOW SEND
FOR RUSSELL PRIME.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.315
CILLIAN: THEY'’LL GET
NOTHING FROM ME.

34:16.358 --> 34:18.404
DEATH TO PRIMES.

34:36.378 --> 34:37.466
HEY.

34:40.165 --> 34:43.124
LOOK, I'’M A JERK.

34:43.168 --> 34:46.258
I WAS TAKING MY FEELINGS
ABOUT OCTAVIA OUT ON YOU.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.434
AND I'’M SORRY.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.656
I DO MISS THEM.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.747
MONTY AND HARPER.

34:57.791 --> 35:02.187
I MAY NOT SHOW IT, BUT I DO.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.623
I KNOW.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.453
I KNOW.

35:11.239 --> 35:12.762
YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.289
I FEEL MYSELF
CLOSING DOWN AGAIN.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.161
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.163
WE'’VE BEEN FIGHTING
TO SURVIVE

35:22.207 --> 35:24.296
SINCE THE MOMENT WE
LEFT THE RING.

35:24.339 --> 35:29.083
I'’VE BEEN FIGHTING TO
SURVIVE ALL MY LIFE.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.180
I WAS 8...

35:39.224 --> 35:42.314
WHEN QUEEN NIA'’S ARMY
TOOK OUR LAND.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.795
MY FATHER RESISTED.

35:45.839 --> 35:49.234
THEY KILLED HIM

35:49.277 --> 35:52.062
WHILE MY MOTHER HID
WITH ME IN THE CELLAR.

35:54.282 --> 35:59.331
"IF YOU CRY, THEY'’LL
HEAR YOU," SHE SAID.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.291
SO I DIDN'’T.

36:03.335 --> 36:06.251
YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'’T
REMEMBER YOUR PARENTS.

36:06.294 --> 36:11.821
BEST WAY TO GET RATS
OUT OF THEIR HOLE--

36:11.865 --> 36:14.650
START A FIRE.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.437
I REMEMBER
THE WAY IT SMELLED.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.613
BUT...

36:23.877 --> 36:26.358
THE SMOKE...

36:31.276 --> 36:33.191
HER HAIR...

36:39.284 --> 36:41.242
WHEN NIA HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED,

36:41.286 --> 36:43.462
SHE EXECUTED THE MEN
WHO DID IT,

36:43.505 --> 36:45.464
HAD ME BROUGHT TO TROY,

36:45.507 --> 36:47.466
AND STARTED MY TRAINING.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.642
COME HERE.

36:54.908 --> 36:58.433
I HATE THAT THAT
HAPPENED TO YOU.

36:58.477 --> 37:01.262
BUT EVERYTHING WE'’VE
BEEN THROUGH

37:01.306 --> 37:03.177
HAS BROUGHT US HERE.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.396
FROM NOW ON,

37:04.439 --> 37:08.748
WE LOOK FORWARD,
NOT BACK.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.374
RUSSELL: LAY HER ON THE TABLE
AND LEAVE US.

37:28.942 --> 37:30.465
WHAT IS THIS?

37:34.295 --> 37:37.298
CILLIAN WAS THE TRAITOR.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.257
HE KILLED HIMSELF BUT NOT
BEFORE USING THE PARALYTIC

37:39.300 --> 37:40.693
ON CLARKE.

37:43.739 --> 37:49.267
RUSSELL, WHY
HAVEN'’T YOU USED
THE ANTIDOTE?

37:49.310 --> 37:51.399
YOU KNOW WHY.

37:53.445 --> 37:55.447
SHE HAS THE BLOOD.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.623
TELL ME NOT TO DO THIS,
AND I WON'’T, SIMONE.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.281
JADE IS BACK.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.457
ROSE IS DEAD.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.939
RUSSELL: OK.
SO HERE'’S THE MATH.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.333
THERE ARE NO MORE HOSTS.

38:12.377 --> 38:16.468
IT WAS 14 YEARS BETWEEN
ROSE AND DELILAH--14 YEARS.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.687
JOSIE'’S STILL THIRD IN LINE.

38:18.731 --> 38:20.385
THAT MEANS HER HOST WON'’T BE
BORN FOR AT BEST 35 YEARS.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.474
ANOTHER 21 UNTIL
HER BRAIN IS READY.

38:24.389 --> 38:28.393
WE CAN WAIT 56 YEARS FOR
OUR BABY GIRL'’S NAMING DAY,

38:28.436 --> 38:30.743
OR WE CAN GET HIM BACK
TONIGHT.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.267
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
KILL THIS INNOCENT GIRL.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.723
I'’LL PREP FOR INSERTION.
YOU CLEAR THE HOST.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.949
I'’M SORRY, CLARKE.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.603
I TRULY AM.

39:04.646 --> 39:08.520
SHH. PLEASE
DON'’T CRY. PLEASE.

39:08.563 --> 39:10.391
I PROMISE
YOU WON'’T FEEL PAIN.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.393
THE MIND OF THE HOST
IS ERASED,

39:12.437 --> 39:14.352
BUT THE BRAIN IS LEFT
UNHARMED.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.359
YOU'’RE GIVING US SUCH A GIFT,
CLARKE,

39:21.402 --> 39:24.840
SACRIFICING YOUR BODY SO THAT
SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT LIVE.

39:24.884 --> 39:28.844
SIMONE: HEY. LISTEN TO ME.

39:28.888 --> 39:31.630
THIS WAS MEANT TO BE.

39:31.673 --> 39:35.590
AFTER 236 YEARS,
JUST AS WE'’RE ON
THE BRINK OF MORTALITY,

39:35.634 --> 39:38.506
A SHIP ARRIVES CARRYING
THIS PERFECT VESSEL.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.946
THIS WAS MEANT TO BE.

40:01.660 --> 40:05.881
RUSSELL: NO MORE FIGHTING,
CLARKE. BE AT PEACE.

40:05.925 --> 40:09.624
A BETTER PLACE, JUST
LIKE YOU SAID YOU WANTED.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.588
THANK YOU FOR THIS.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.426
HERE SHE COMES.

40:29.731 --> 40:32.908
BRAIN ACTIVITY
RETURNING.

40:32.952 --> 40:35.476
ADMINISTERING
THE ANTIDOTE TO
THE PARALYTIC NOW.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.524
JOSEPHINE? JOSEPHINE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

40:39.567 --> 40:40.829
BLINK IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,
SWEETHEART.

40:42.701 --> 40:45.530
IT'’S OK. YOU'RE NOT
FALLING. YOU'’RE SAFE.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.488
I HATE THIS PART. IT
NEVER GETS ANY EASIER.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.622
BREATHE. BREATHE,
MY BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL.

40:50.665 --> 40:51.884
IN.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.494
DAD?

40:53.538 --> 40:55.496
YEAH, YEAH.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.019
MOM?

40:57.063 --> 40:58.804
OH, MY GOD.

40:58.847 --> 41:03.896
-OH, MY GOD.
-WELCOME HOME, BABY.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.681
SIMONE: THE SUTURES
ARE HOLDING.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.596
BUT TAKE IT SLOW.

41:26.179 --> 41:28.050
STOP WITH THE HAIR.

41:34.622 --> 41:36.798
NOW, THIS I CAN WORK WITH.
