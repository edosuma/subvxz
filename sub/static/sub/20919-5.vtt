00:00.609 --> 00:03.227
[sirens wailing]

00:03.262 --> 00:06.137
[Captain Marvel over radio]
Ms. Marvel, you almost there?

00:06.173 --> 00:09.766
Almost. Almost. And I'm here!

00:09.802 --> 00:11.951
I've got visual on our target.

00:11.987 --> 00:14.029
It's big, it's mean,
it's got three heads,

00:14.064 --> 00:16.264
and it's heading
for Times Square.

00:16.299 --> 00:20.160
Oh, no, you don't! [Whimpers]

00:20.195 --> 00:22.312
Captain Marvel, where are you?

00:22.347 --> 00:23.930
Situation's fluid. Stand by.

00:25.910 --> 00:28.176
[growling, barking]

00:28.212 --> 00:30.128
Captain Marvel,
the others are in position.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.247
Where's Ms. Marvel?

00:32.283 --> 00:34.465
Relax, Black Panther.
She's right where I put her.

00:34.501 --> 00:37.519
[growling]

00:37.554 --> 00:39.988
This will not work.
Ant-Man! Wasp!

00:40.024 --> 00:42.407
Strategy B! Go!
What's Strategy B?

00:44.552 --> 00:47.045
Say hello to Strategy B!

00:47.080 --> 00:48.914
Ant-Army, assemble and attack!

00:53.287 --> 00:55.770
[grunts] Whoa!

00:55.806 --> 00:59.558
Converting to high-density mode.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.402
Hold on, Avengers!
Wait! Vision, pull up!

01:02.437 --> 01:04.254
Look out!

01:04.289 --> 01:05.597
[grunts]

01:08.510 --> 01:11.495
[growling] Very well, then.
Strategy C.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.913
I will do it myself.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.416
Never fear, mortal. [Grunts]

01:16.452 --> 01:19.519
Hercules, the Prince of Power,
is here!

01:19.554 --> 01:21.271
[grunts]

01:21.306 --> 01:22.914
[laughs]

01:22.949 --> 01:24.841
[grunting] [people screaming]

01:24.877 --> 01:26.993
[Black Panther]
There are people inside.

[straining]

01:45.773 --> 01:48.732
[sighs] I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.826
Good, because
we could use your help.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.352
Embiggen!

01:53.722 --> 01:56.314
[all straining]

01:57.710 --> 01:58.710
[Hercules yelling]

01:59.828 --> 02:00.760
[all gasp]

02:00.796 --> 02:02.579
[grunts, chuckles]

02:02.614 --> 02:03.947
Well, dog, do you plan

02:03.982 --> 02:07.400
to blow your disgusting
breath at me, or... [grunts]

02:07.436 --> 02:10.453
[growling] One for you, you,
you, you, you, and you!

02:13.266 --> 02:15.575
[growling continues] [yells]

02:15.611 --> 02:16.771
[car alarm blaring]
[car alarm horn honking]

02:16.795 --> 02:18.803
[whimpering]

02:18.839 --> 02:20.380
Wait for it.

02:22.651 --> 02:25.761
Ha! Yes!

02:25.796 --> 02:29.331
Sometimes the only way to make a bad
dog sit is a good rap on the nose.

02:29.366 --> 02:32.192
[Wasp] Okay, I give up.
Who are you?

02:32.269 --> 02:37.013
I am Hercules, Prince of
Power, Lion of Olympus,

02:37.048 --> 02:39.499
Greatest of the Argonauts!

02:39.535 --> 02:42.961
Huh! So Hercules
just happened to show up

02:42.996 --> 02:46.205
when we're getting our butts
handed to us by a giant magic dog.

02:46.241 --> 02:49.309
Our butts would be fine had you
kept to the original plan.

02:49.344 --> 02:52.346
Now see here.
I am Hercules, the...

02:52.381 --> 02:54.247
Yeah, yeah. We know.

02:54.282 --> 02:56.316
No plan survives contact
with the enemy.

02:56.351 --> 02:59.887
You changed my plan
before we could even try it.

02:59.963 --> 03:02.431
Let's everyone take a deep breath.
[chuckles]

03:02.433 --> 03:05.450
I don't mean to interrupt,
uh, whatever this is.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.966
But I've come to find the Avengers.
Do you know where they are?

03:10.049 --> 03:11.598
We're them. We're the Avengers.

03:13.476 --> 03:15.143
[uproarious laughter]

03:16.855 --> 03:19.005
[muttering, chuckling]

03:19.041 --> 03:20.815
[chuckling stops]

03:20.851 --> 03:23.851
You're serious. Ah, never mind.

03:23.887 --> 03:26.195
If you are the Avengers,
I must speak with your leader.

03:26.231 --> 03:28.598
That's me. That is me.

03:28.633 --> 03:31.652
All right. Let's try again.

03:31.687 --> 03:33.370
Which of you
speaks for the team?

03:33.405 --> 03:35.371
[both] Me.

03:35.406 --> 03:39.459
Wonderful! My people
invented democracy.

03:39.494 --> 03:42.954
But you should know, a team
without a leader is not a team.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.173
Fortunately, I am here
until you find one.

03:45.209 --> 03:48.576
Muscles has a point.
It is unseemly

03:48.612 --> 03:50.415
to have this debate in the middle
of the street. [Car horn honking]

03:50.439 --> 03:52.147
Then it's settled. [Groans]

03:52.182 --> 03:53.682
Lead the way, friends.

03:58.246 --> 04:01.014
Oh-ho-ho, this is fabulous!

04:01.049 --> 04:04.901
The larders are full, the
sparring room is without equal,

04:04.936 --> 04:06.794
and the entertainment!
[crowd cheering]

04:06.830 --> 04:09.047
I have never seen
this kind of wrestling before,

04:09.082 --> 04:12.517
but it's fantastic!

04:12.553 --> 04:15.654
Really? Huh. I figured all this
would be a little low rent for you,

04:15.689 --> 04:17.464
coming from Olympus and all.

04:17.499 --> 04:20.149
Olympus has many wonders,
Rider of Ants.

04:20.185 --> 04:24.537
But for a lion such as myself,
it's only dull, gray stone.

04:24.572 --> 04:26.272
As I told Jason...

04:26.308 --> 04:29.134
Jason and the Argonauts Jason?

04:29.169 --> 04:31.930
We studied him in school. Were you
with him when he fought the Kraken?

04:33.173 --> 04:35.106
Sure. Why not?

04:35.142 --> 04:37.725
Wow! A Kraken!

04:37.761 --> 04:40.353
Team meeting, conference room.

04:40.389 --> 04:42.930
I'll attend the next one.

04:42.966 --> 04:45.533
The pro-wrestling
has my attention right now.

04:45.568 --> 04:47.936
Did you say, "The next one"?

04:47.971 --> 04:50.447
Indeed.
I am joining the Avengers.

04:50.482 --> 04:56.036
Together, we shall make a team
to eclipse all others.

04:56.071 --> 04:59.264
Hercules... the actual Hercules...
is gonna be an Avenger!

04:59.299 --> 05:01.107
[Hercules] Huzzah!

05:01.142 --> 05:05.120
Absolutely not.
Hercules must go.

05:05.155 --> 05:08.348
Analysis indicates Hercules is in the
same strength class as Thor or the Hulk.

05:08.383 --> 05:10.183
The team could use a big gun.

05:10.218 --> 05:12.760
But not a loose cannon.

05:12.795 --> 05:14.546
Hercules caused half
of the damage today.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.649
The monster did the damage.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.476
And if we're gonna face things like
that, we can use a heavy hitter.

05:20.511 --> 05:23.246
Maybe we should vote on it?
We should not.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.599
This is a command decision,
and I am command.

05:25.634 --> 05:28.260
You think you're
in command here?

05:28.295 --> 05:31.345
I called the team together
in the first place.

05:31.381 --> 05:34.307
I'm a battle-tested leader. I've clocked
way more combat hours than you.

05:34.342 --> 05:36.059
[hits table] I am a king!

05:36.094 --> 05:41.072
Not to mention the best tactician
and the highest intellect.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.452
Look, we're both qualified, but
someone has to call the shots!

05:43.476 --> 05:45.001
It's not about calling shots.

05:45.036 --> 05:49.756
I have plans for this team,
and Hercules is not in them!

05:49.791 --> 05:52.917
I don't get your problem
with the big guy.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.595
Why not give Hercules a chance to
prove himself? ♪ [Techno blaring]

05:57.507 --> 05:59.182
What is that?

06:01.495 --> 06:02.495
♪ [continues]

06:05.015 --> 06:06.481
Vision, what's going on?

06:09.978 --> 06:12.829
[whimpers]
Avengers! Hello again!

06:12.864 --> 06:15.740
Ooh, gimme! [Wasp]
What is all this?

06:15.775 --> 06:19.244
A party. To celebrate
me joining the team.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.870
[chomps, laughs]

06:20.906 --> 06:23.055
This is not how we do things.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.457
Avengers do not throw parties.

06:27.495 --> 06:30.880
What? Tony Stark threw the best parties.
Why can't we party?

06:34.144 --> 06:37.962
[growling]

06:37.998 --> 06:40.156
That. That is precisely
why we cannot party.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.433
[roaring]

06:44.730 --> 06:49.165
Fan out. We need to figure out
exactly what we are up against.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.467
[screeches] [grunts]

06:51.502 --> 06:53.778
[roaring]
This is an unusual threat.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.825
Further analysis is required.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.863
Giant snakes are trying to eat us!
[grunts]

07:03.898 --> 07:07.167
Analysis over! [Yelling]

07:09.170 --> 07:12.205
Bug bomb special! Bombs away!

07:12.240 --> 07:15.242
Oh, that's gotta... Come on, man!

07:15.277 --> 07:17.437
Hey, don't eat Ant-Man.
You don't know where he's been.

07:20.349 --> 07:22.490
Thanks. Ew!

07:22.525 --> 07:24.901
[screeches]

07:24.936 --> 07:27.929
Hey! Where's he going? [Grunts]

07:27.964 --> 07:30.782
[yells]
This is making me seasick!

07:30.818 --> 07:32.633
[straining]

07:32.669 --> 07:34.435
[grunts] I'm okay!

07:34.470 --> 07:36.137
[yells]

07:36.173 --> 07:37.880
Come on!

07:37.916 --> 07:39.591
Give me a soft, squishy target.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.735
[roaring]

07:41.770 --> 07:43.778
That'll work! [Moaning]

07:43.813 --> 07:46.972
[roars] [grunts]

07:47.008 --> 07:48.874
Yet another strange monster.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.752
This one with four heads.

07:52.648 --> 07:54.581
[gasps] Not four!

07:54.616 --> 07:57.408
Eight! [Grunting]

07:57.444 --> 07:59.911
Fear not, Avengers!

07:59.946 --> 08:02.705
The Lion of Olympus is here!

08:02.741 --> 08:04.891
[yells]

08:08.838 --> 08:11.213
That was a monster
we call a Hydra.

08:11.249 --> 08:16.552
Beaten back into the Stygian depths
by Hercules and the Avengers.

08:16.587 --> 08:19.572
Well, only one thing
left to do now.

08:22.310 --> 08:24.611
Our team has got its Thor.

08:24.646 --> 08:27.738
I'm no Asgardian, young Marvel.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.633
Thor is mighty, yes,
but his people are cold,

08:30.669 --> 08:33.159
grim, dull.

08:33.196 --> 08:36.813
Olympians are hot blooded,
zesty, full of...

08:36.850 --> 08:38.933
Dude, and you've got
your own Mjolnir.

08:38.967 --> 08:41.219
Don't be so grumpy.
You saw what he did

08:41.254 --> 08:44.563
to those monsters.
Does Hercules even care?

08:44.599 --> 08:47.942
Protecting Earth and saving
lives is all a game to him.

08:47.978 --> 08:50.670
You don't know that. When it
comes to the actual fight,

08:50.705 --> 08:52.049
Herc will...
Arm wrestle! Here! Now!

08:52.073 --> 08:54.916
Hercules versus Captain Marvel!

08:54.951 --> 08:57.351
You're gonna arm-wrestle me?
Then you're gonna lose, Muscles.

08:58.638 --> 08:59.504
[plate shatters]

08:59.539 --> 09:01.756
[laughing]

09:01.791 --> 09:05.017
Goin' down, Chuckles.

09:05.052 --> 09:07.406
I will be in the control center trying to
find a pattern to these monster attacks.

09:07.430 --> 09:09.505
[groans]

09:09.541 --> 09:12.008
Whoa-ho-ho!

09:12.043 --> 09:13.320
Don't trouble yourself
with those beasts.

09:13.344 --> 09:17.530
That's why I'm here. I'll take
care of them when they show.

09:17.565 --> 09:20.074
You can relax.
We have chips and salsa.

09:20.110 --> 09:21.534
"When they show"?

09:21.570 --> 09:22.885
[groans]

09:25.065 --> 09:27.440
Are there more
of these things coming?

09:27.517 --> 09:30.443
Aren't you listening to me?
I'll take care of it.

09:30.478 --> 09:32.270
Relax. Chips and salsa.

09:34.783 --> 09:38.243
Bah! You sound just like
my father, Zeus.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.053
I'm the Prince of Power.
You're but a stuffy mortal.

09:41.089 --> 09:42.089
[grunts]

09:44.109 --> 09:46.109
We are not finished yet.

09:46.144 --> 09:48.770
Now tell me why you are here

09:48.805 --> 09:50.524
and what these monsters have
to do with it. [Grunts]

09:50.548 --> 09:55.835
[grunting]

09:55.871 --> 09:59.213
Ha! It has been too long since I had a
good wrestling bout. [Thunderous thud]

10:02.352 --> 10:04.102
Now what?

10:04.137 --> 10:07.030
[male voice]
Thief! I know you're in there!

10:07.065 --> 10:09.699
Aw, crud.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.119
[growling]

10:13.155 --> 10:16.247
There you are!
Did you think you could

10:16.283 --> 10:19.091
hide from me forever,
little brother?

10:19.127 --> 10:20.919
Oh. [Chuckles]

10:20.954 --> 10:23.003
Hey there, brother.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.031
What brings you to New York?

10:25.066 --> 10:27.575
Hercules' brother?
Which brother are you?

10:27.611 --> 10:29.444
Please be one of the nice ones.

10:29.479 --> 10:33.072
I am Ares, Prince of War,

10:33.107 --> 10:34.907
Harbinger of Destruction,

10:34.942 --> 10:36.926
Bringer of Pain.

10:36.961 --> 10:39.070
So, kind of not nice.

10:39.105 --> 10:43.283
Go away, Ares!
The Mace of War is mine!

10:43.318 --> 10:46.260
So beat it back to Olympus
and leave me alone!

10:46.296 --> 10:48.980
I think not. [Groans]

10:49.015 --> 10:52.667
No one steals from me.

10:52.702 --> 10:55.661
Especially not something
as powerful as the Mace of War.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.472
This has gone on
long enough, thief.

10:57.507 --> 11:00.650
Now steps aside, mortals.

11:00.685 --> 11:02.777
No.

11:02.813 --> 11:05.554
As much as I want
rid of Hercules,

11:05.589 --> 11:08.600
we cannot just hand him over.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.277
The return of the mace is up
for discussion, but then...

11:11.312 --> 11:13.412
You will get no discussion!

11:13.448 --> 11:16.015
You will get only war! [Grunts]

11:16.050 --> 11:17.500
[grunting] [grunts]

11:19.596 --> 11:21.229

[grunting]

11:24.609 --> 11:26.142
[yells] [growling]

11:26.177 --> 11:29.479
Bad Cerberus! Bad! Bad!

11:29.514 --> 11:31.355
[growling continues] Stop!
[grunts]

11:31.390 --> 11:34.400
Bad doggie! Heel! Down!

11:34.436 --> 11:36.310
Stay! Stay!

11:38.540 --> 11:41.124
Ow. [Grunting]

11:41.159 --> 11:43.234
[grunting]

11:48.750 --> 11:51.676
These are the fabled
Avengers of Earth?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.520
Bah! You're nothing!

11:54.556 --> 11:57.081
Do not ever again meddle in
affairs beyond your mortal grasp.

11:59.227 --> 12:00.401
[grunts]

12:00.437 --> 12:02.086
[barking, growling]

12:04.725 --> 12:07.233
[Vision] Strange. Ares'
portal remains open.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.452
We can still rescue Hercules.
[grunts]

12:09.487 --> 12:12.230
I still am not convinced
we should be involved.

12:12.307 --> 12:14.390
This is Olympian business.
A little late for that.

12:14.425 --> 12:18.886
Besides, it's Avengers business.
Hercules is one of us.

12:18.921 --> 12:22.289
Inviting himself over to the
mansion makes him an Avenger?

12:22.325 --> 12:25.009
Not to mention, he
apparently stole from Ares.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.862
My instincts tell me
something more is going on.

12:27.897 --> 12:29.071
Your instincts?

12:29.106 --> 12:32.116
We need informed decision
making and leadership.

12:37.206 --> 12:39.790
[sighs] Very well.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.425
Hercules may not be an Avenger,

12:41.461 --> 12:43.761
but you are.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.571
We will try it
your way, Captain.

12:45.607 --> 12:47.173
For now.

12:53.589 --> 12:54.639
Whoa.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.601
[Ant-Man] Mount Olympus.

12:58.636 --> 13:01.562
Well, as magical paradises go,
it's not bad.

13:01.598 --> 13:03.722
[Ares] What is this?

13:03.758 --> 13:06.684
Mortals, daring to set foot
in sacred Olympus

13:06.719 --> 13:08.728
without leave or invitation?

13:08.763 --> 13:10.355
Madness!

13:10.390 --> 13:12.473
We've got questions, Ares.

13:12.508 --> 13:14.642
What's so special
about that mace?

13:14.677 --> 13:16.146
And what are you planning
to do to Hercules?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.755
My brother is a thief.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.733
Stealing any of my weapons
would be crime enough,

13:21.768 --> 13:24.827
but this mace is the key
to opening Tartarus.

13:24.862 --> 13:27.688
Like so!

13:27.724 --> 13:30.132
[Black Panther]
Tartarus? What is...

13:33.054 --> 13:37.748
I called a handful of beasts
to find my brother.

13:37.784 --> 13:41.586
Now I call upon the thousand beasts
of the Underworld! [Growling]

13:41.621 --> 13:44.055
That's why you left
the portal open.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.157
You're gonna send them
all to Earth!

13:46.192 --> 13:50.027
You Avengers
and the entire realm of Earth

13:50.063 --> 13:52.463
shall know my punishment.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.575
You shall know the wrath
of the Kraken!

13:57.044 --> 13:58.536
[roaring]

13:59.839 --> 14:02.423
[roaring]

14:02.459 --> 14:04.042
[all grunt]

14:04.077 --> 14:06.578
Go for its legs.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.179
Keep it from moving
to the portal!

14:08.215 --> 14:10.522
No, go high!

14:10.558 --> 14:13.600
Tie up its arms
so it can't attack!

14:13.636 --> 14:16.579
What are you doing? We can't
let it get through to Earth.

14:16.614 --> 14:18.481
That's why we're supposed
to be fighting it!

14:18.516 --> 14:21.375
[Ares] The mortals cannot win.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.761
The Kraken will destroy
your friends,

14:23.797 --> 14:26.388
then it will travel to Earth
and destroy it.

14:26.423 --> 14:28.666
[grunts]

14:28.702 --> 14:32.295
A fitting punishment
for your disrespect, brother.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.372
[grunting]

14:34.407 --> 14:37.266
Ares, I've had enough
of you, brother!

14:37.302 --> 14:39.126
[roars]

14:39.162 --> 14:40.369
Huh? [Grunts]

14:40.404 --> 14:41.921
Aah!

14:41.956 --> 14:43.864
Is this even working?

14:43.900 --> 14:46.667
It depends on your
definition of "working."

14:46.703 --> 14:48.394
"Who is the leader" can wait.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.846
We must solve
the immediate problem.

14:49.881 --> 14:53.382
We need to put down this Kraken
and close the hole.

14:53.418 --> 14:55.518
And we need to stop Ares.

14:55.553 --> 14:57.228
[Kraken roaring]
Field commander.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.930
Big Picture.

15:00.742 --> 15:02.708
[grunts]

15:02.743 --> 15:04.936
[laughs, grunting] [yells]

15:06.172 --> 15:07.413
[grunts]

15:07.448 --> 15:08.990
[grunting]

15:09.025 --> 15:11.367
Is that the best you... [grunts]

15:11.444 --> 15:14.928
This will put an end to you,
brainless layabout!

15:14.964 --> 15:16.697
[grunts]

15:16.733 --> 15:18.757
Thank you, friend Panther.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.517
Do not thank me just yet,
Hercules.

15:20.553 --> 15:24.755
Fools. I am Ares,

15:24.791 --> 15:28.976
winner of 10,000 battles, the
greatest warrior of all time!

15:29.011 --> 15:31.754
[yelling]

15:34.383 --> 15:37.676
Hey, Ares, you like baseball?

15:37.712 --> 15:39.311
Then batter up! [Grunt]

15:39.347 --> 15:41.906
[both grunt]

15:41.942 --> 15:45.501
Captain Marvel would say
we need to fight smarter.

15:45.536 --> 15:47.570
We have to work together!
Over there.

15:47.605 --> 15:49.963
It's his Chest of War.

15:49.999 --> 15:51.515
Go for it.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.775
[yells]

15:54.704 --> 15:57.380
[roaring]

15:57.415 --> 15:59.323
[grunting]

16:02.236 --> 16:03.786
Aah!

16:03.821 --> 16:06.138
A real Kraken!

16:06.174 --> 16:07.667
My literature teacher's
never gonna believe this!

16:07.691 --> 16:09.408
Whoa!

16:09.443 --> 16:12.003
[grunting] Aah!

16:15.116 --> 16:18.426
Vision, keep
its foot on lockdown.

16:18.461 --> 16:22.779
Ms. Marvel, get around its other leg
and turn it back towards the pit.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.982
Ant-Man, Wasp, go for the face.

16:25.017 --> 16:28.218
Try not to get eaten this time.

16:28.254 --> 16:31.705
Oh, hey, that gives me an idea.
[grunting]

16:31.741 --> 16:33.641
I'm going in. You with me?

16:33.676 --> 16:36.760
Are you out of your mind?

16:36.796 --> 16:39.021
Yes. And into his.

16:39.056 --> 16:42.008
[blows landing] Ugh! Ew!

16:42.043 --> 16:44.035
Oh, fine.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.122
[blows landing] [roaring]

16:50.960 --> 16:53.169
[straining]

16:57.600 --> 16:59.758
[Captain Marvel] Even if
we get it back in the pit,

16:59.793 --> 17:01.569
we can't lock the gates
without the mace.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.046
[chuckles] Great.

17:04.082 --> 17:06.156
Black Panther's got me thinking
big picture.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.751
[grunting]

17:08.786 --> 17:11.329
Tired yet, brother?
You wish, brother!

17:11.364 --> 17:12.438
[grunting]

17:17.078 --> 17:18.752
I'll see you suffer!

17:18.788 --> 17:22.290
[grunting]

17:22.291 --> 17:24.800
You're always so overly
dramatic about... [groans]

17:24.836 --> 17:26.643
And then there was that time...
[groans]

17:26.679 --> 17:27.935
[grunts]

17:27.972 --> 17:29.914
What? Game on.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.993
[grunting] [grunts]

17:34.028 --> 17:36.036
You see, brother?

17:36.072 --> 17:38.497
See how easy it was
to take it from you again?

17:38.533 --> 17:41.259
You never truly appreciated
its... [grunts]

17:41.294 --> 17:43.085
Ooh!

17:43.120 --> 17:45.587
[grunts]

17:45.623 --> 17:48.341
You think I need the mace
to destroy you?

17:48.376 --> 17:51.093
You think I need anything?

17:51.129 --> 17:54.738
I will end you with my bare hands!
[grunts]

17:54.774 --> 17:57.183
[grunts] Ooh!

17:57.218 --> 17:59.868
There you are, my beauty,

17:59.903 --> 18:02.972
back where you belong.

18:03.007 --> 18:07.134
Shame about all this ruckus,
but now we should...

18:07.169 --> 18:09.214
[blows landing] Were you
really just gonna stroll off?

18:09.238 --> 18:12.022
Not very Avengery, Herc.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.933
Now, now, young Marvel. It's not
what it appears. [Both grunting]

18:14.969 --> 18:18.070
Captain Marvel sent me
for the mace.

18:18.105 --> 18:20.842
Now, you're gonna give it to me, then you're
gonna go back and help Black Panther.

18:20.866 --> 18:23.885
You hear me? Yes, ma'am.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.971
[yells, grunts]

18:27.006 --> 18:28.589
Didn't realize this thing
was so heavy.

18:28.624 --> 18:31.225
[groans]

18:31.260 --> 18:34.161
Bravery is nothing.
Loyalty is nothing.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.497
Strength is nothing.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.900
You may be skilled, mortal,
but you could never defeat Ares.

18:39.936 --> 18:41.393
To be a true... [grunts]

18:41.428 --> 18:43.303
Aahh!

18:43.339 --> 18:45.447
Will you shut up?

18:47.242 --> 18:49.694
This is all my fault.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.054
You do not have to
fight my battle.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.540
Avengers do things as one.
We assemble.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.310
[yelling]

18:57.345 --> 19:00.421
[yells] [groans]

19:02.025 --> 19:05.083
[distorted groan]

19:05.119 --> 19:07.761
[groans] You are quite the
warrior, friend Panther.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.814
Hmm? Hmm.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.867
[straining]

19:12.902 --> 19:15.261
[roaring]

19:15.296 --> 19:16.812
[grunts]
Let's never do that again!

19:19.917 --> 19:21.400
[grunts]

19:26.207 --> 19:27.698
[roaring]

19:29.110 --> 19:31.885
[all straining]

19:31.921 --> 19:34.554
Kamala, get that mace over here!

19:34.590 --> 19:37.023
We can't hold them much longer!

19:37.059 --> 19:40.319
Hercules!

19:40.354 --> 19:44.624
Have a nice trip, Ares!
[screaming]

19:44.659 --> 19:47.552
[roaring] [screaming continues]

19:47.587 --> 19:48.969
[Kraken shrieks]

19:49.005 --> 19:51.547
Avengers, now! [Grunts]

19:51.582 --> 19:52.582
[grunts]

19:54.293 --> 19:56.543
[grunts]

19:56.579 --> 19:59.914
Let me out of here!

19:59.949 --> 20:01.682
[grunting]

20:01.717 --> 20:03.984
Noooo!

20:08.916 --> 20:11.817
I'm sensing a little hatchet
burying happened back there.

20:11.853 --> 20:15.303
We are not best friends yet,
but we could be teammates,

20:15.339 --> 20:16.997
if Hercules wishes
to join the Avengers.

20:20.077 --> 20:22.477
Perhaps someday.

20:22.513 --> 20:25.264
I still have much to learn
about responsibility

20:25.299 --> 20:28.233
and being a true hero.

20:28.268 --> 20:31.578
But when I am ready to join,
I will seek out your leader.

20:31.613 --> 20:34.673
Er, whichever of you it is.

20:34.709 --> 20:39.286
Yes, well, we never
did settle that, did we?

20:39.322 --> 20:41.822
Isn't it obvious?
You're both leaders.

20:41.857 --> 20:44.158
Panther's the general.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.034
And Captain Marvel
is the field commander.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.162
Works for me.

20:48.197 --> 20:50.464
If Captain America and Iron Man

20:50.499 --> 20:52.539
could figure out how to work
in concert, we can too.

20:57.548 --> 21:01.675
Quiet, everybody.
Vision, vote count.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.411
One vote for pizza,
two votes for sushi,

21:04.447 --> 21:06.229
two votes for giant-sized
super burritos.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.198
And I, of course, abstain,

21:08.233 --> 21:10.992
because I do not eat.
[door opens]

21:11.028 --> 21:13.111
I vote for Greek.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.097
There is a lovely restaurant
only five blocks...

21:15.133 --> 21:16.460
Don't you have
something to finish?

21:16.484 --> 21:18.642
Uhh... [chuckles]

21:20.938 --> 21:24.056
It's a good thing I was here
to clean up this mess.

21:24.091 --> 21:25.899
[sighs]

21:28.003 --> 21:36.003
What would the Avengers
do without me?
