00:50.926 --> 00:53.887
<i>The great white shark,
a vicious predator...</i>

00:56.557 --> 00:57.891
<i>ruled by instinct.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:01.270
<i>Jordan Kovalenko,</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:05.482
<i>star running back and vicious predator...</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:08.360
<i>ruled by instinct.</i>

01:09.278 --> 01:10.862
<i>The Roseate Spoonbill,</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:12.781
<i>at first sight a bit strange,</i>

01:13.490 --> 01:17.494
<i>but then she spreads her wings
and becomes the picture of elegance.</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:19.621
<i>Molly Ellington Kent,</i>

01:19.705 --> 01:22.916
<i>pure, bespectacled,
eighth-grade awkwardness.</i>

01:23.917 --> 01:26.044
<i>But on the first day of ninth grade,</i>

01:26.169 --> 01:28.589
<i>Molly spread her wings and took flight.</i>

01:29.715 --> 01:31.925
<i>And the males of her species took notice.</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:34.636
<i>The peacock spider.</i>

01:34.720 --> 01:37.806
<i>He flashes his colorful abdomen
to attract the females.</i>

01:39.141 --> 01:40.183
<i>Owen Sheridan.</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:42.477
<i>He flashes his colors in order to...</i>

01:43.395 --> 01:45.564
<i>Well, you know, you get the message.</i>

01:47.691 --> 01:48.900
<i>When it comes to mating,</i>

01:48.984 --> 01:51.153
<i>I'm not really sure
what kind of animal I am,</i>

01:51.236 --> 01:54.156
<i>mostly because, well,
I haven't had sex yet.</i>

01:54.656 --> 01:57.909
<i>I'm not opposed to it,
I just haven't found the right girl.</i>

01:58.660 --> 02:00.287
<i>Maybe that means I'm a penguin guy.</i>

02:00.912 --> 02:03.498
<i>They're sweet, a little awkward,
and they mate for life,</i>

02:03.582 --> 02:05.042
<i>which I think is kind of romantic.</i>

02:05.959 --> 02:07.377
<i>I've always been a romantic.</i>

02:08.544 --> 02:10.964
<i>My guy friends are definitely
a bunch of horny monkeys.</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:13.342
<i>Proboscis monkeys, to be exact.</i>

02:13.759 --> 02:16.511
<i>Goofy, rowdy, and obsessed
with the size of their...</i>

02:16.970 --> 02:18.680
<i>uh, noses.</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:22.976
<i>So to be clear, none of us are winning
any football trophies,</i>

02:23.060 --> 02:24.853
<i>but we're not totally D-list.</i>

02:26.605 --> 02:27.439
<i>In fact...</i>

02:27.522 --> 02:30.067
The next president of Buchanan High is...

02:31.360 --> 02:32.486
Alex Truelove.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.741
<i>Yeah, that's my actual last name.</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:40.911
<i>I've taken plenty of shit for it
over the years.</i>

02:40.994 --> 02:44.998
<i>Eventually I owned it
and used it for political gain.</i>

02:45.332 --> 02:48.001
<i>But it hasn't done much
to help me with girls.</i>

02:48.085 --> 02:50.671
<i>I mean, who'd want to go out
with a cephalopod-obsessed,</i>

02:50.754 --> 02:52.089
<i>Type A wildlife nerd?</i>

02:53.298 --> 02:56.009
Don't be dangling this
out of some damn window.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.512
This is a $1,200 piece of equipment.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.390
If you bust it doing something stupid,

03:02.182 --> 03:04.017
I'll take it out of your deposit.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.727
Okay?

03:06.228 --> 03:07.729
Okay, great.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.859
So now let's talk about batteries.
Everybody's favorite subject, right?

03:13.235 --> 03:15.779
- These batteries. Run the battery down...
- Excuse me.

03:15.862 --> 03:16.697
Sorry for spying.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.366
Is that a blue-ringed octopus?

03:19.449 --> 03:20.575
Wow.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.120
You know your cephalopods.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.996
So please, I beg you...

03:30.544 --> 03:31.378
I want you...

03:31.920 --> 03:34.464
Always take the lens cap
off the lens.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.675
...to be my video production partner.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.844
- Oh.
- If you don't already have one.

03:39.428 --> 03:40.262
Truelove?

03:40.595 --> 03:43.181
Quit trying to pick up the new girl.
Pay attention.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.767
Thank you.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.103
- Now, my future Fellinis...
- Truelove?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.313
Yeah. You can call me Alex, though.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.735
You can call me
your video production partner.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.194
Partner.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.238
Take the lens cap off...

03:59.239 --> 04:01.867
<i>That was the beginning
of Savage Kingdom High,</i>

04:01.950 --> 04:03.702
<i>hosted by Alex and Claire.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:08.165
Well, it's mating season
here at Buchanan High.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.209
And just like
a colony of randy African hippos,

04:11.293 --> 04:12.919
the kids are getting it on.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.714
The Piranha Patrol is at it again.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.716
Let's see who survived
the latest social feeding frenzy.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.678
<i>What began as a high school video project,</i>

04:21.762 --> 04:23.472
<i>became a semi-popular web series</i>

04:23.555 --> 04:27.309
<i>dedicated to the savage kingdom
that is the modern American high school.</i>

04:29.227 --> 04:31.521
Here we'll find the library lemurs

04:31.605 --> 04:33.565
camouflaged in their natural habitat.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.483
Follow me.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.987
Look, I've discovered a nest.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.616
It's rare to find so many in one place.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.034
A substantial herd.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.454
Who are the naked mole rats
of Buchanan High?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.956
<i>The answer might surprise you.</i>

04:50.415 --> 04:53.293
Holy shit. We already have 28,000 views.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.587
I told you a topless video would kill.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.631
What a weird, pervy world we live in.

05:02.093 --> 05:02.928
What?

05:05.472 --> 05:07.599
Do you want to come
to the homecoming dance with me?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.062
Oh. Um...

05:12.145 --> 05:14.564
I mean, I know it's like
a lame high school ritual,

05:14.648 --> 05:17.442
but, I don't know, we could rig
the Homecoming Queen election

05:17.526 --> 05:20.195
so that you win, and then
we could pour pig's blood on you

05:20.278 --> 05:22.781
and you could burn down the gym
in a telekinetic rage.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.206
Darling.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.875
<i>And the best part is...</i>

05:34.584 --> 05:36.336
<i>we won Homecoming King and Queen!</i>

05:37.087 --> 05:38.755
Does this dress make me look fat?

05:41.174 --> 05:44.219
<i>After that, we went
to every high school dance we could.</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:45.345
<i>But just as friends.</i>

05:48.098 --> 05:49.891
Your chariot awaits.

05:50.934 --> 05:51.768
What's wrong?

05:52.602 --> 05:53.979
My mom is in the hospital.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.984
She's at Harrison Methodist, right?

05:59.568 --> 06:02.320
Aren't they like
a really cutting-edge cancer hospital?

06:02.404 --> 06:03.363
Yeah.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.906
Yeah, so she's in good hands.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.284
I guess.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.370
They're gonna do a bunch of tests.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.163
It just sucks.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.290
Yeah, it sucks.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.672
You look cute, Sid Vicious.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.177
- I'm sorry, I ruined the night.
- No, you didn't ruin anything.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.972
Come on, we can have
our junior prom right here.

06:29.055 --> 06:29.973
It's all good.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.754
Did we just ruin the friendship?

07:01.838 --> 07:02.881
I don't care.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.517
<i>The next day
I went to the aquarium with Claire,</i>

07:14.851 --> 07:16.603
<i>my official girlfriend.</i>

07:17.854 --> 07:19.940
<i>I kept waiting for her to turn and say,</i>

07:20.023 --> 07:23.360
<i>"Just kidding, you're clearly too dorky
to be boyfriend material."</i>

07:24.235 --> 07:25.320
<i>But she never did.</i>

07:28.782 --> 07:29.824
<i>And now...</i>

07:30.825 --> 07:31.785
<i>Senior year.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.746
<i>I think this could be
the girl I'm gonna marry.</i>

07:34.829 --> 07:36.915
<i>As for sex, it hasn't happened yet,</i>

07:36.998 --> 07:38.541
<i>but any day now.</i>

07:38.917 --> 07:39.751
<i>Any day.</i>

07:40.752 --> 07:44.089
<i>♪ First time Kelly kissed a boy ♪</i>

07:45.298 --> 07:49.135
<i>♪ Glow in the dark arrow in the heart ♪</i>

07:49.219 --> 07:53.306
<i>♪ First time Kelly kissed a boy ♪</i>

07:54.391 --> 07:57.310
Hey, hey, hey, dudes,
I have a question for you.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.272
Okay, where is the craziest place
you guys have ever done it?

08:01.356 --> 08:02.357
Like, sexy time.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.277
The back room of Cookie Eclipse.

08:06.903 --> 08:07.821
Like at work?

08:07.904 --> 08:11.491
Yeah, the smell of chocolate chips
was wafting through the air.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.034
Sounds magical. Josh?

08:13.451 --> 08:14.953
Inflatable dragon.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.913
Like one of those bouncy castles?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.708
Inflatable dragon.
That's all I'm gonna say, man.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.668
Wow.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.294
- Hey, boys.
- Hello.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.379
Perfect timing.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.382
I'm collecting some scientific data
for a research project.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.343
Wait, do we have a research project due?
When is that? Is that AP History?

08:30.427 --> 08:32.261
- When is that due?
- Oh my God.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.972
Where is the craziest place
you guys have ever done it?

08:35.724 --> 08:36.725
- Oh.
- Hmm.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.059
That's easy, we have not done it yet.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.737
What? It's true. I've been trying
to de-virginize you for eight months.

08:48.820 --> 08:49.654
You won't let me.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.197
Okay, see you inside.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.160
Wow.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.163
- Guys. Guys, look...
- Dude. Oh, my God.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.791
Dude, you were just like stripped
of your penis before our very eyes.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.001
Balls too.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.127
Ballsack included.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.962
Your dick is gone, though.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.464
Yeah, it dropped right off.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.174
Gone in a poof of dick glitter.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.303
No, we just want it to be special.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.221
Oh my God, you're gay.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.432
- That's very funny.
- No, no, no, really.

09:17.515 --> 09:20.268
There's nothing wrong with that.
It's the 21st century.

09:20.852 --> 09:21.770
Everyone's gay.

09:21.853 --> 09:22.687
Are you gay?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.230
- Fuck no!
- Well, neither am I.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.273
Homophobes.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.735
Can't we just get past this whole
horny, teenage boy archetype.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.654
Quite frankly, the idea that it's gay
to think of sex

09:31.738 --> 09:34.699
as something that's meaningful and special
is offensive.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.577
That's the gayest sentence
anyone's ever said, dude.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.246
Okay, so what is it?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.332
Am I gay, or did my dick fall off?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.374
Your dick fell off.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.210
Good luck being gay with no dick.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.347
- May I help you?
- What was that?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.225
What? I was just answering
Dell's question.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.061
No, you weren't.
You totally threw me under the bus.

10:03.144 --> 10:07.732
And not like any bus, like a giant,
hulking tour bus for Beyoncé.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.234
- Don't be dramatic.
- I'm not.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.529
But you made me seem
like a prudish, sexophobic freak.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.280
Well, isn't that kind of true?

10:15.406 --> 10:16.491
No.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.492
What?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.078
That is so not true.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.831
- I never wanted to wait until marriage.
- Shh. Okay.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.625
- Not that specifically.
- Well, then what specifically?

10:27.085 --> 10:27.919
Okay.

10:28.878 --> 10:33.341
Why is it every time we're,
you know, like, going at it,

10:33.424 --> 10:35.802
you always put the brakes on
at a certain point?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.595
Well... I don't know.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.932
I just... We've never really talked
about going past that point.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.395
- Maybe we should just go for it.
- Yeah.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.646
You know, I mean...

10:48.022 --> 10:50.567
- I'd like to.
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.235
Okay, so when?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.452
Let's get a hotel room.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.912
- What?
- Let's do it.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.664
Let's get a hotel room next week.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.082
Deal?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.961
Okay, I don't think
you're supposed to shake on this.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.171
- Okay. Deal.
- Okay.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.133
I'm gonna sex you so good
you wont know what time it is.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.342
Wow.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.344
- I like that.
- Yeah?

11:18.428 --> 11:21.431
I'm gonna sex you like a tornado on fire.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.599
Nice.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.768
I'm gonna sex you
like a gorilla would sex his...

11:26.102 --> 11:28.313
fuzzy, furry gorilla...

11:29.898 --> 11:31.065
life mate.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.776
- You should workshop that one.
- Yeah, it's not as good.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.323
The Golgi apparatus is responsible

11:38.406 --> 11:40.658
for the manufacturing and shipping

11:40.742 --> 11:42.744
of the molecules produced by,

11:43.328 --> 11:47.832
and synthesized in,
the endoplasmic reticulum.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.543
But the most amazing thing
about all of this...

11:50.627 --> 11:53.046
is Alex Truelove
is going to have sex next week.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.714
What?

11:55.131 --> 11:56.132
Hot...

11:56.216 --> 11:57.091
sweaty...

11:57.592 --> 11:59.219
ass-slapping intercourse...

12:00.011 --> 12:01.554
of a sexual kind.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.141
Just try not to fuck it up.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.936
Okay, yeah.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.190
Okay, read pages 121 through 140

12:12.273 --> 12:13.524
for tomorrow, guys.

12:13.608 --> 12:14.651
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.568
Okay?

12:19.489 --> 12:20.490
I found my dick.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.908
I'll be the judge of that.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.119
Not that it's any of your business,
but Claire and I talked

12:25.203 --> 12:27.497
and we're planning
a little date next week.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.374
A consummation, if you will.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.960
"Consummation"? Are you my grandma?

12:32.043 --> 12:34.629
- I need your help.
- It's called "bumping uglies," Alex.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.755
Your sister's help.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.174
Or "vaginal humping"
if you want to get technical.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.259
- Dell!
- What?

12:39.342 --> 12:41.261
I need Hillary to book me a hotel room.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.762
You predator.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.806
You have to be over 18 to book a room.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.516
- So get Josh to do it. He's 18.
- What?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.393
No, no. I want to keep this
under the radar.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.519
Is she still in town?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.813
Oh, she's in town
for the foreseeable future.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.232
Fun fact, she got kicked out
of Northside Community College,

12:54.315 --> 12:57.110
- if you can believe that.
- Okay, will you talk to her, please?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.738
Since it's for a good cause. Yeah! Yeah!

13:00.822 --> 13:02.740
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Oh!

13:02.824 --> 13:04.450
Yeah, congratulations, Truelove.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.035
You will be a man soon.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.912
Well, that makes one of you.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.207
<i>Okay, sidebar. Sophie Hicks.</i>

13:11.291 --> 13:14.919
<i>♪ Ooh, baby
Do you know what that's worth? ♪</i>

13:15.295 --> 13:18.881
<i>♪ Ooh, heaven is a place on earth ♪</i>

13:18.965 --> 13:22.844
<i>♪ They say in heaven love comes first ♪</i>

13:22.927 --> 13:26.848
<i>♪ We'll make heaven a place on earth ♪</i>

13:26.931 --> 13:30.351
<i>Dell has had a mad crush
on Sophie Hicks since elementary school.</i>

13:30.435 --> 13:32.562
<i>In the sixth grade,
he thought it'd be a brilliant move</i>

13:32.645 --> 13:36.316
<i>to take some 11-year old beefcake selfies
and send them to her for Valentine's Day.</i>

13:37.400 --> 13:40.153
<i>Of course, Sophie couldn't keep
a treasure like that to herself,</i>

13:40.236 --> 13:42.196
<i>and it wasn't long
before the entire sixth grade</i>

13:42.280 --> 13:43.573
<i>was enjoying Dell's photo shoot.</i>

13:44.615 --> 13:48.411
<i>Thus branding him "Delgado Beanpolio"
for the rest of his life.</i>

13:48.494 --> 13:49.537
<i>But he didn't care.</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:51.581
<i>Dell has always been an optimist.</i>

13:51.664 --> 13:52.874
Sophie Hicks.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.125
You know you love me.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.002
Yeah, let me sleep on that one.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.254
Are you inviting me to sleep with you?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.382
Sophie, that's so forward.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.969
In another dimension, Delgado.
Another dimension.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.974
A man can dream.

14:11.392 --> 14:15.646
So, I'm thinking
we go full <i>Great Gatsby</i> for prom.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.441
Some hardcore Jay and Daisy action.
What do you think?

14:21.069 --> 14:21.944
Hello?

14:22.862 --> 14:23.821
Condoms.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.323
What?

14:26.532 --> 14:29.702
I don't have any condoms,
so we should stop off at the Rite Aid

14:29.786 --> 14:31.537
before we do the whole hotel thing.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.957
Oh, God, Alex,
please do not freak out about this.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.334
I'm not freaking out.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.086
Yes, you are. I know you.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.130
You will stress out and get all uptight
and scrunch up your face,

14:41.214 --> 14:43.091
just like you are doing right now.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.510
You shouldn't worry so much.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.136
It's not sexy.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.597
Excuse me? I'm plenty sexy.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.061
Wow, what a... what a crazy party.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.480
You're awesome.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.150
Yes.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.738
Has anyone ever told you
that you have beautiful breasts?

15:06.823 --> 15:11.577
So perky and well-proportioned.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.872
You should take off your bra.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.128
Oh, you want me to take off your bra?

15:21.087 --> 15:21.921
Okay.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.758
Oh, nice.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.760
Boobies.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.096
Mmm.

15:30.805 --> 15:31.973
Does that feel good?

15:33.975 --> 15:35.059
Do you like that?

15:35.977 --> 15:38.104
I want to throw caution to the wind

15:38.187 --> 15:41.023
and make sweet love to you.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.568
Long and sensuous.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.196
I want to slide my hard cock

15:47.280 --> 15:48.823
into your wet pussy.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.825
- Alex?
- What? What?

15:52.201 --> 15:53.161
Claire's here.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.745
Great.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.707
Who were you talking to?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.292
No one. Myself.

15:59.834 --> 16:00.668
My monkey.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.254
Okay.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.631
Hey!

16:06.090 --> 16:08.759
Okay, so Dell does not know
that it's a Drama party.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.219
So don't tell him anything.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.055
What's up? What's going on?

16:14.724 --> 16:15.641
I got in.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.852
To Columbia?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.479
Oh, my God. That's awesome.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.189
Congratulations. Amazing.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.232
You got into Columbia?

16:23.316 --> 16:27.028
Ron, Claire got into Columbia.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.322
- Congrats, Claire.
- Thanks.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.824
So when the hell
are you gonna hear from Columbia?

16:31.908 --> 16:34.911
He's gonna get in. I applied early.
That's the only reason I heard.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.746
You sent in the essay about Scout camp?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.707
Nope, I sent the one
about the autistic kid at the rec center.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.834
Ooh, that's good. Autism is good.
I'm sure you're in.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.712
It's a good thing we have autistic kids
to help us get into college.

16:44.795 --> 16:48.007
Okay, Mr. Sarcasm.
You'll be whistling a different tune

16:48.090 --> 16:52.178
when you and Claire are walking across
the Columbia quad together next fall.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.805
Dad, just don't jinx it, okay?
I'm stressed out enough already.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.683
Okay. Well, we are very proud
of you, Claire.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.977
Oh, thanks.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.271
I can't wait to visit you two on campus.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.232
Shut up, Dell.
I don't even know if I got in.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.484
And Claire, FYI, I will be trying
to hook up with your roommate.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.654
So, let's just try
and get that out in the open

17:09.737 --> 17:11.405
so no one's uncomfortable later.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.740
Okay, duly noted, Dell.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.827
<i>Willkommen!</i>

17:17.286 --> 17:19.789
Wait, is this a Drama party?

17:20.455 --> 17:21.540
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.835
Here. You're welcome too, my boy.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.760
Hi!

17:32.843 --> 17:34.428
You were so good!

17:35.680 --> 17:38.724
You're killing me. You're so good.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.152
You sure you don't want
anything stronger to drink?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.113
We're completely surrounded by Drama kids.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.199
This is Amaro,
the Italian digestif, my friend.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.578
- What do you have against Drama kids?
- They only have shit like "Amaro"

17:58.661 --> 17:59.745
to drink at a party.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.747
Trust me, it's strong.
That's why I'm sipping it.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.458
One day, Truelove,
I'm gonna get you freakin' hammered

18:04.542 --> 18:05.876
on good old-fashioned beer,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.879
and then you'll realize that cutting loose
is actually fun.

18:08.963 --> 18:12.758
Acting dumb and puking your guts out
sure sounds like a lot of fun to me.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.760
Don't knock it till you tried it.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.181
Greetings, Buchanan Drama geeks.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.933
This party is about to begin.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.560
Please tell me you brought me beer.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.478
Beer?

18:24.562 --> 18:28.065
Where we're going, we don't need beer.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.819
It's a frog.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.946
It's the Guyana banana leaf toad.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.906
Wait. That's an extremely rare species.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.618
Hell yeah. Do you know how hard it was
to get one over the internet?

18:38.701 --> 18:41.954
You smuggled an illegal exotic animal
into the country?

18:42.038 --> 18:46.334
Illegal, exotic,
and highly psychoactive, baby.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.088
I owe you and Claire a huge thank you
for your weird-ass videos.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.425
Otherwise, I wouldn't even know
that this guy exists.

18:56.010 --> 18:56.844
So...

18:57.720 --> 18:59.013
Who's first?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.141
No.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.435
No way, we're not licking this frog.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.395
Oh, we are so licking this frog.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.774
Dell, wait, that is dangerous,
and toxic, and...

19:10.900 --> 19:12.610
And delicious.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.446
All right, I can't watch this.
I gotta go pee.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.198
Shit.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.240
What happened?

19:20.868 --> 19:21.744
Uh...

19:21.827 --> 19:24.789
You lost the frog?
You... you dumb shit!

19:25.790 --> 19:27.083
God help us.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.429
Shut the door.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.472
Shut it.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.270
Sorry to be so gruff, but honestly,
I don't want to advertise this

19:48.354 --> 19:50.064
to the entire world, okay?

19:50.147 --> 19:51.273
Yeah, sure, sure.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.027
Come on, join the cool kids.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.737
Hey.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.118
- Do you guys go to Buchanan?
- No.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.204
Actually, I go to Northridge
and I met Sophie at drama camp.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.915
He doesn't even go to high school.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.333
Yeah, I'm a juvenile delinquent.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.127
Really?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.963
No. I graduated last year.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.049
Tragically, she's still got
one more year to endure.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.428
Yeah, that's why I'm getting stoned.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.012
Okay.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.639
Elliot.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.598
Alex.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.058
Gretchen.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.184
Yeah! Hey!

20:29.729 --> 20:32.148
I think we're here to corrupt you, Alex.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.318
He's gone.
He's totally fucking gone, Dell.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.946
Don't yell at me, man.
It was a slippery little shit.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.073
You owe me $1,100 bucks.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.451
I'd be more concerned
about the environmental catastrophe

20:43.534 --> 20:44.744
when that thing breeds.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.746
That's not funny, dude.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.663
Help me look.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.708
Have you looked
next to the singing garden hose?

20:55.129 --> 20:56.922
What are you talking about?

20:59.383 --> 21:00.843
I, uh... yeah.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.516
I think I'm going to go inside
and get a drink of water.

21:08.392 --> 21:12.480
What is this weird vendetta that you have
against the cheerleaders at our school?

21:13.022 --> 21:16.609
The cheerleaders at our school
phone it in.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.862
I mean, if they were more
like the competition cheerleaders

21:19.945 --> 21:22.656
that actually did gymnastics
and had real skills

21:22.740 --> 21:24.700
and smiled so wide
that they looked psychotic,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.285
I'd totally be into it.

21:26.368 --> 21:29.205
- Okay, fine, you have a point.
- I definitely have a point.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.457
Every time we have an argument, I'm right.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.293
So the sooner you accept that,
the better our relationship will be.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.086
- Okay. Kiss and make up.
- Yeah.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.298
Aww, you guys are the cutest couple.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.966
Mmm, I think so.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.136
If only Elliot were straight.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.222
- Shut up.
- Or bi...

21:46.514 --> 21:47.431
Or poly.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.308
Then at least I'd have a chance.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.185
What's "poly"?

21:51.602 --> 21:54.939
It's some new thing kids at our school
are experimenting with.

21:55.022 --> 21:55.856
Polyamory.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.484
Everyone except this one.

21:58.943 --> 21:59.819
But, alas...

22:05.199 --> 22:06.867
Sorry, wrong room.

22:06.951 --> 22:07.910
Don't be silly.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.538
- Come join us, kind knave.
- No, no, really, I...

22:10.621 --> 22:13.040
Oh, hush. Oh, hush, hush, hush, hush.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.501
We're gonna play Sound Ball.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.378
Sweet, gentle Jesus.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.631
You guys live together?

22:21.382 --> 22:25.594
Uh, yeah, my dad sort of flipped
about the whole gay thing, so...

22:26.387 --> 22:27.221
Oh, shit.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.933
Oh, yeah, I mean, it wasn't a surprise.
He's kind of a redneck.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.561
Plus, I posted a coming out video
on YouTube,

22:33.644 --> 22:36.355
which did not help my case.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.482
Did he kick you out?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.571
It was a mutual decision.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.034
Besides, I graduated, so...

22:49.535 --> 22:51.453
Time for me to spread my wings, right?

22:52.663 --> 22:57.334
And lucky for me, Gretchen has, like,
the coolest parents known to man.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.380
Elliot can cook,
so we're totally keeping him.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.675
And last week, he made this...

23:05.217 --> 23:07.094
kick-ass <i>osso buco.</i>

23:10.306 --> 23:12.641
I'm not even sure I know what that is.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.519
It's really fucking good.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.792
Oh. Oh, God, no. Please, no.

23:38.876 --> 23:40.085
No, no.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.637
Remember me, bitch?

23:49.720 --> 23:50.804
I'm sorry.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.649
God, he's good.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.485
I don't know him. Was he in <i>Pippin?</i>

24:08.280 --> 24:11.367
So, mister fancy class president Alex,

24:13.243 --> 24:15.079
What are your craziest hopes and dreams?

24:15.162 --> 24:17.289
Oh, I don't know how crazy they are.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.333
Go to Columbia next year,

24:19.792 --> 24:21.335
major in Marine Biology,

24:21.794 --> 24:24.046
get married at some point, have kids.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.673
Maybe move out west to...

24:26.090 --> 24:27.424
Seattle, Arizona...

24:27.883 --> 24:28.759
Wow.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.428
You've got the whole thing all mapped out.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.139
Yeah. What can I say? I'm a planner.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.737
Alex.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.040
Worms.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.085
Eat us.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.337
Eat us.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.841
Delicious worms.

<i>National Geographic </i> photographer.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.234
Hm?

25:27.693 --> 25:29.194
Crazy hopes and dreams.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.112
I guess.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.407
I tell people marine biologist because...

25:33.782 --> 25:35.284
because it sounds lucrative, but...

25:36.160 --> 25:38.328
really, I just want to take pictures
of animals.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.497
It's pretty nerdy, I guess.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.666
- Okay, what's your favorite animal?
- Proboscis monkey.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.835
- They live in the mango groves of Borneo.
- Wow.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.003
- Yep.
- That's intense.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.630
- Yes. Sorry, I'm a little obsessed.
- That's okay.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.258
I like a guy with strong opinions.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.013
Yeah.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.856
There you are!

26:06.732 --> 26:09.526
You little stoner.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.653
Guys, meet my friend, Claire.

26:11.737 --> 26:12.863
Friend?

26:13.322 --> 26:14.156
Unh-unh.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.034
I am his lover.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.161
We do dirty things together.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.789
Okay, little miss Chatty Cathy.

26:21.872 --> 26:24.541
Sorry, was that TMI? I'm a little buzzed.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.503
It's okay. We totally support
passionate love making.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.214
- Oh, actually, we have not...
- Okay, I think we should go.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.882
Yeah, let's go. Let's go home.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.259
- We should get you home.
- Oh, I'm feeling a little...

26:34.343 --> 26:35.803
- Let me get you home.
- Bye.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.055
Alex, it was nice to meet you.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.765
Yeah, nice to meet you.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.018
Bye.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.816
Get away from here!

26:51.068 --> 26:52.778
Okay. Where are we going?

26:54.530 --> 26:56.615
- You're sexy.
- You're sexy.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.866
A sexy...

26:57.950 --> 26:59.409
sex man.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.579
Screw the hotel, let's just do it here.

27:02.663 --> 27:03.872
What? I don't know.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.625
- Get in the tub, bitch!
- Okay.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.338
Are you serious?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.967
- Is this the right atmosphere for...
- Shh.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.807
- Oh, hello, Dell.
- Hey, Dell.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.227
Hey, you don't look so good, man.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.925
Yeah, he's just lying in the flower bed.

29:23.971 --> 29:24.805

29:26.390 --> 29:27.933
Better than him, at least.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.978
Who are you texting?

29:31.311 --> 29:33.897
I'm texting that guy Elliot
from the party last night.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.691
We were hanging out in the bedroom.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.401
- The gay kid?
- Yeah.

29:37.734 --> 29:41.071

You know?

29:42.072 --> 29:43.198

Brooklyn.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.452
Look at you, hipster man.

29:47.536 --> 29:48.578
Yeah.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.832
You can come if you want,
but I think he only has one ticket.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.669
I think I've got to lay low today.

- Amazing.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.243
And the guitarist girl,

31:10.327 --> 31:12.788
when she was playing
with her hair in her face.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.415
- She was flipping it away.
- No fucks given.

31:15.665 --> 31:18.668
- I've never been to a concert like that.
- Dude, I'm so glad you liked it!

31:20.003 --> 31:23.048
Hey, I've got to say,
I'm glad Gretchen bailed on you tonight.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.132
It was fun.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.218
Actually, I have a confession.

31:27.928 --> 31:31.014
Gretchen was never coming. I said that
'cause I didn't want it to sound weird

31:31.098 --> 31:33.266
- that I invited you out of the blue.
- Oh.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.435
Very sneaky.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.939
So why did you just invite me
out of the blue?

31:39.523 --> 31:40.357
I don't know.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.902
Maybe I like the fact that you're obsessed
with that penis-faced monkey.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.195
It's not penis-faced.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.363
Alex, I looked it up.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.699
- That thing has a cock nose.
- What? No. That's ridiculous.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.993
The real question is,
what does that say about you?

31:52.077 --> 31:52.911
Nothing.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.209
I like other animals too, you know.
I like the octopus.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.504
Excuse me? That's like a penis
eight different times.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.173
It's like an entire creature
made of penises.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.969
- It's like an "octo-cock."
- Maybe you just like reading into things.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.554
Maybe.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.310
So, I have a girlfriend.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.688
I know.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.690
I met her. She's adorable.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.066
She is. She is.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.027
Are you in love?

32:26.111 --> 32:26.945
Yeah.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.780
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Definitely.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.073
Have you guys, uh...?

32:30.699 --> 32:32.451
That's not... That's private.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.035
Come on, whatm are you a Mormon?

32:34.119 --> 32:35.829
- No.
- Okay. So?

32:37.247 --> 32:38.331
Well, if you...

32:40.667 --> 32:43.795
- If you must know, we haven't quite...
- I knew it.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.965
But we're going to.
I booked a hotel room next week, so...

32:49.259 --> 32:50.677
Yeah, something like that.

32:51.344 --> 32:54.264
- Yeah.
- You're not nervous at all? Like, at all?

32:54.347 --> 32:55.265
No.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.143
I'm freaking stoked.
I'm totally, totally stoked and thrilled.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.854
I can't wait.
I wish it was happening tonight.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.482
I don't believe you.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.027
All right, well,
perhaps I am a little bit...

33:07.110 --> 33:08.820
- terrified of the whole thing.
- Yeah.

33:08.904 --> 33:09.946
- Thought so.
- I...

33:10.697 --> 33:13.200
I know I'm not like mister alpha male guy.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.326
I'm listening.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.535
I love Claire.

33:15.619 --> 33:16.453
I really do.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.498
- Yeah, but do you want to rock her body?
- Yes. I would like to.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.416
I would very much like to rock her body.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.543
Okay, then go forth and conquer.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.378
Just here's the thing.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.634
I'm a virgin.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.844
What? No.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.763
But Claire isn't. None of them are.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.933
What do you mean? Are you saying
no girls in high school are virgins?

33:38.016 --> 33:40.519
No. I'm saying that girls know their shit.

33:40.977 --> 33:44.189
You know, they have websites
dedicated to their vaginas.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.441
They Snapchat their bazongas
with their friends.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.359
Bazongas?

33:47.442 --> 33:49.653
They shoot gnarly sex videos
with their boyfriends,

33:49.736 --> 33:50.946
and then post them online.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.822
They watch <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

33:52.906 --> 33:54.991
Okay, you might have a point.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.786
I'm just... I'm worried
that I'm not gonna measure up.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.955
What? Dude, Alex, you can't worry
about that stuff.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.165
I do, I worry about that kind of stuff
all the time.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.668
You know, what if I'm not as good
as her last boyfriend?

34:04.751 --> 34:07.087
Or what if I can't find the, um...

34:07.546 --> 34:09.047
You know, the frigging...

34:09.297 --> 34:10.507
- The little...
- Clitoris.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.967
The clitoris. Yes.
See, I can't remember the name of it.

34:13.260 --> 34:16.137
You know, I'm like totally
not an expert on this, um,

34:16.221 --> 34:18.098
but I've found that...

34:19.014 --> 34:20.809
when you are in the moment,

34:21.268 --> 34:23.603
things just fall into place,

34:23.687 --> 34:25.938
and it just happens.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.068
You shouldn't worry so much, Alex.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.529
Yeah, I've heard that before.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.576
So, wait, you've slept with girls?

34:39.077 --> 34:40.911
I tried. It never really worked out.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.833
Right. But you said everything
just fell into place.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.460
Yeah, with guys.
I mean, that's how I knew I was gay.

34:48.545 --> 34:49.379
Right.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.382
Right. But how did you... how did you,
like, know you were gay,

34:52.465 --> 34:54.259
and not bi or something like that?

34:55.302 --> 34:56.761
How do you know you're straight?

34:57.679 --> 34:59.681
I don't know. I guess I just knew.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.474
I guess.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.018
You guess?

35:04.644 --> 35:06.438
Yeah. I don't know.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.397
You're a dork.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.107
- I'm not a dork.
- Yes, you are.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.986
A dork is what you call a whale's penis.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.487
That's the term for it.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.531
And the shitty thing is,

35:16.615 --> 35:19.826
guys like my dad,
they're giving Jesus a bad name, okay?

35:19.909 --> 35:23.371
Because from all that I know,
Jesus was amazing.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.458
I mean, I don't know,
he helped out the poor and sick, okay,

35:26.541 --> 35:28.126
he loves you unconditionally...

35:29.002 --> 35:33.131
I just think all those kids
with their WWJD wristbands

35:33.214 --> 35:36.343
need to ask themselves,
"What would Jesus actually do?"

35:37.302 --> 35:39.137
Call me a "faggot loser"?

35:40.513 --> 35:41.890
Did your dad call you that?

35:44.309 --> 35:46.061
It's not really worth getting into.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.360
What I don't get is...

35:53.443 --> 35:55.987
how do you know
if you're like a good person?

35:57.364 --> 35:59.407
I feel like if you're asking yourself
that question,

35:59.491 --> 36:01.034
you're probably a good person.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.328
At least you're trying.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.333
You're a smart kid, Alex.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.251
Mm-hmm. 3.94 GPA.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.338
I don't mean like that, you nerd.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.673
I mean, like...

36:15.590 --> 36:16.758
that you're insightful.

36:17.717 --> 36:18.718
I don't know.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.179
Most of the time
I just feel like I'm confused.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.725
Maybe you think I'm insightful
because you're special.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.772
- Special Ed
- Rude.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.816
Ooh, cat-like reflexes.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.275
- That was good.
- Oh!

36:35.652 --> 36:36.861
You're strong.

36:40.782 --> 36:41.991
All right, you win, you win.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.416
Well, um...

36:51.042 --> 36:54.087
I guess, like, I should be...

36:54.713 --> 36:56.631
"on the road," as they say.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.800
As who says? Willie Nelson?

36:59.676 --> 37:00.927
Yeah, Willie Nelson.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.522
That was really great.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.441
Shhh. Shh.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.317
Don't ruin the song.

37:54.981 --> 37:55.899

37:56.858 --> 37:59.444
There's a girl on your front porch.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.114
Wow. That would be...

38:03.698 --> 38:05.909
- That would be Claire.
- I thought so.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.119
- She just came out of your house.
- Gee. This is...

38:08.203 --> 38:09.204
This is...

38:09.829 --> 38:11.456
It was a pleasure hanging out with you.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.209
Yes. Nice doing business with you.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.045
Perhaps we can hang out again.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.464
Perhaps we could. Perhaps we could.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.008
- Thank you for the ride.
- Yeah, sure.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.219
- Uh, text me...
- Bye-bye.

38:24.844 --> 38:25.929
...some time.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.309
Jesus, how long you been out here?

38:31.392 --> 38:32.352
Not long.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.814
- Did you guys have fun?
- Uh, yeah, it was fine.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.273
You were gone a long time.

38:37.357 --> 38:38.274
Uh...

38:38.358 --> 38:40.777
- Yeah, we got some food after the show.
- How romantic.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.446
- Not really.
- Did you guys make out?

38:43.822 --> 38:45.698
What? No?
Why would you say that?

38:45.782 --> 38:47.450
Calm down, I was joking.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.036
I like you. I like girls.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.747
I want to sleep with girls,
you in particular.

38:52.831 --> 38:53.706
That's a relief.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.458
Geez, I can't wait to sleep with you.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.544
What is your problem?

38:57.627 --> 39:00.672
Nothing, but it's midnight and you show up
here like this crazy stalker person.

39:00.755 --> 39:01.923
Excuse me?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.675
I can't have one night to myself?

39:04.717 --> 39:05.593
Okay.

39:06.386 --> 39:07.887
I don't know what your deal is,

39:07.971 --> 39:10.598
but you're acting like an asshole,
so I'm gonna go.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.519
- Claire...
- And just for the record,

39:14.602 --> 39:16.437
I was with my mom at the hospital tonight.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.731
She's okay, but I got really depressed
hanging out there,

39:18.815 --> 39:20.108
so I thought I'd come here.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.150
Big mistake.

39:21.776 --> 39:22.902
Claire...

39:22.986 --> 39:25.321
You know, it's not always about you, Alex.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.157
Claire.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.496
Okay...

39:41.796 --> 39:43.006
Hi, interweb.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.384
No new episodes
of <i> Savage Kingdom High</i> today.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.011
In fact...

39:48.595 --> 39:50.346
I'm alone, because...

39:51.180 --> 39:54.183
frankly, my counterpart
is on my shit list.

39:55.476 --> 39:59.230
Can someone please explain
modern high school boys to me?

39:59.314 --> 40:00.773
They are so...

40:01.232 --> 40:02.317
oversensitive,

40:02.400 --> 40:05.445
and high-strung, and selfish,

40:05.528 --> 40:07.030
and just like rude.

40:08.281 --> 40:12.076
My mom made me watch this old movie
the other day, <i>Sixteen Candles,</i>

40:12.160 --> 40:15.705
and in it, the main girl
is in love with a senior, Jake.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.374
And Jake is hot. Like hot, hot.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.711
And he's kind of a tool, but he's...

40:22.378 --> 40:24.047
sweet and dumb,

40:24.130 --> 40:26.174
and I'm like, "Yes, that is what I want.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.383
I want a Jake."

40:28.301 --> 40:29.510
I mean, Alex is...

40:30.386 --> 40:33.222
straight A's, class president,
pretty decent dresser,

40:33.306 --> 40:35.016
like perfect boyfriend on paper,

40:35.099 --> 40:37.393
but he is more high-maintenance

40:37.477 --> 40:39.854
than all of my girlfriends put together.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.731
And it's not like he...

40:41.814 --> 40:42.690
Oh my God, Mom.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.651
Sorry, I just...

40:48.154 --> 40:51.074
I may not be the best person
for relationship advice.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.409
Clearly, your father would agree.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.578
But my sense is

40:56.329 --> 40:59.666
that Alex is a pretty decent guy.

40:59.749 --> 41:02.210
It's just, sometimes he acts like...

41:02.710 --> 41:04.420
he's stuck in a marriage.

41:04.504 --> 41:05.338
You know?

41:06.506 --> 41:08.466
Like I'm constricting him,

41:08.549 --> 41:11.552
and all he wants to do is hang out
with his dumbass friends.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.806
Sounds like a teenage boy to me.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.849
Teenage boys suck.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.101
That they do.

41:18.184 --> 41:22.271
But so do college boys
and middle-aged men.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.274
Old guys are okay, I guess,
except for the...

41:25.775 --> 41:27.276
cranky, racist ones.

41:30.029 --> 41:32.031
Maybe I should become a lesbian.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.242
Believe me, I've thought about it.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.619
So, what do I do?

41:37.537 --> 41:41.541
Just forgive Alex for being a dick
and move on?

41:41.916 --> 41:43.209
Or you could stay mad.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.463
But what I do know is...

41:47.964 --> 41:50.967
we're not gonna be on this earth forever.

41:52.010 --> 41:52.844
And...

41:54.178 --> 41:58.349
being angry is an exhausting way
to spend your day.

42:01.686 --> 42:02.645
I love you.

42:03.604 --> 42:04.647
I love you, too.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.194
Oh, I heard what you were saying

42:10.278 --> 42:12.572
about Jake in <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

42:13.406 --> 42:15.199
You'd be bored with a Jake.

42:15.783 --> 42:16.868
You're too smart.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.606
Whoa.

42:47.857 --> 42:48.775
Okay.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.243
Gay Flakes.

43:01.204 --> 43:04.540
Heter O's. Gay Flakes.

43:21.808 --> 43:22.642
Bi.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.020
I'm bisexual.

43:27.188 --> 43:29.774
- Say what?
- I'm bisexual. I think I'm bisexual.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.317
- No, you're not.
- What?

43:31.400 --> 43:33.152
You're panicking, dude.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.779
You're wigging out about the hotel,

43:34.862 --> 43:37.073
and you're trying to come up
with an excuse to cancel it.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.784
No, I'm just taking advantage
of all the options available.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.410
Do you listen to Panic! at the Disco

43:41.494 --> 43:43.329
while jerking off to pictures of vampires?

43:43.746 --> 43:44.664
What? No.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.374
Then you're not bisexual.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.416
I...

43:47.500 --> 43:49.210
It's just that there's this guy...

43:49.710 --> 43:51.963
who I'm pretty sure has a crush on me,

43:52.046 --> 43:53.422
and I guess I'm not...

43:53.965 --> 43:55.925
- repulsed by the idea.
- Hm.

43:57.009 --> 43:57.927
I see.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.599
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

44:04.308 --> 44:05.476
What are you doing?

44:05.560 --> 44:07.186
- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus, dude.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.730
- Is this what you want, Alex?
- No, not at all!

44:09.814 --> 44:12.441
Oh, really? That's not what I was
hearing a minute ago.

44:12.525 --> 44:14.527
You say you're into cock?
Well, here you go.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.321
The finest specimen at Buchanan High.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.615
Oh, pay this no mind, ladies.

44:19.699 --> 44:22.577
I'm just proving a little point
to your student body president.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.620
I'm not interested in your junk.
Put it away.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.372
Oh, but I thought you were bi.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.166
I'm not interested in your junk.
Your junk.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.543
- Zip it up.
- I am.

44:31.752 --> 44:32.962
See my point, Truelove?

44:33.045 --> 44:35.756
How am I to believe
you're into slurping on nutsack,

44:35.840 --> 44:37.216
when you won't look at mine?

44:37.300 --> 44:39.218
- I'm not into slurping on nutsack.
- Right.

44:39.302 --> 44:42.513
You know why?
Because nutsacks aren't sexy.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.141
Look, it's a confusing time, man.

44:45.224 --> 44:48.227
I mean, everywhere you look,
someone's omnisexual, or...

44:48.311 --> 44:50.104
polyamorous, or gender queer,

44:50.188 --> 44:52.190
or transitioning into God knows what.

44:52.273 --> 44:54.400
And before you know it,
you turn into Sidney.

44:54.775 --> 44:55.693
Hey, Sidney.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.905
Are you into vagina or dick?

44:58.988 --> 45:00.323
I'm attracted to the person.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.034
Whatever the fuck that means.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.577
Sorry, Sydney. I'm sorry.

45:04.660 --> 45:05.912
It's like <i>Mad Max </i> out here.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.288
You know, guys doing guys,

45:07.371 --> 45:09.665
girls doing girls...
not that I object to that.

45:09.749 --> 45:13.586
Girls turning into guys and doing girls
that used to do girls and guys. Aah!

45:14.003 --> 45:16.547
Isn't anyone just plain straight anymore?

45:17.506 --> 45:20.051
Which brings us to you, Alex.
I have a diagnosis.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.093
Geez, I can't wait.

45:21.469 --> 45:23.888
What you have is a man crush on a guy.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.557
And the guy just happens to be gay.

45:27.266 --> 45:28.226
That's how it is.

45:29.644 --> 45:31.229
A man crush on a gay guy.

45:32.021 --> 45:34.398
- Yeah.
- I never really thought of it like that.

45:34.482 --> 45:36.651
And that man crush,
mixed with your epic neurosis

45:36.734 --> 45:38.653
about fucking your girlfriend
for the first time

45:38.736 --> 45:40.780
is making you say crazy shit,
like you're bi.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.073
Yeah, yeah, you could be right.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.532
- Of course I'm right.
- Sure.

45:48.329 --> 45:49.413
Hey, Helen.

45:50.081 --> 45:51.666
- How are you?
- Great.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.503
She's upstairs,
and she's not a happy camper,

45:55.586 --> 45:56.504
so...

45:56.921 --> 45:58.422
don't act like a dumbass.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.049
Roger that.

46:43.259 --> 46:44.218
Maybe?

46:49.432 --> 46:51.892
Do you want to edit the platypus video?

46:51.976 --> 46:54.020
I have to take my mom to an appointment.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.272
Why are you so cool?

46:58.274 --> 46:59.400
I'm serious.

46:59.483 --> 47:00.776
You're a rockstar.

47:01.527 --> 47:04.030
I don't know what I'd do
if my parents were that sick.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.158
Probably not take them for granted
so much.

47:07.241 --> 47:08.200
Yeah, you would.

47:08.284 --> 47:10.745
I still take my mom for granted
all the time.

47:12.163 --> 47:15.207
I still make her deal
with my stupid teenage drama.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.209
Yeah, you're the worst.

47:18.002 --> 47:18.961
You suck.

47:23.632 --> 47:24.633
Alex...

47:27.595 --> 47:30.222
Maybe this whole hotel idea is stupid.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.516
I mean...

47:32.933 --> 47:35.603
I just don't want you to feel
any pressure whatsoever

47:35.686 --> 47:37.271
to do something you're not ready to do.

47:37.563 --> 47:38.397
Thank you,

47:38.856 --> 47:40.775
but I want to do this.

47:41.859 --> 47:42.693
I'm ready.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.154
Okay, me too.

47:45.237 --> 47:46.072
In fact...

47:47.198 --> 47:48.366
I may talk dirty.

47:48.908 --> 47:51.160
Well, then, I can't wait.

47:54.330 --> 47:55.748
You're so stupid.

48:04.632 --> 48:05.716
Magnum.

48:09.261 --> 48:10.388
- Alex?
- Hey.

48:11.055 --> 48:11.889
Elliot, hey.

48:12.932 --> 48:14.266
- How's it going?
- Great, great.

48:14.350 --> 48:16.769
Just browsing, you know.
Just sort of, um...

48:17.728 --> 48:19.563
You know, uh, getting ideas.

48:19.647 --> 48:20.940
Just checking it out.

48:21.023 --> 48:23.484
Just seeing what options I have.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.027
So, tonight's the night?

48:25.111 --> 48:27.738
No, no, no, no, no, um...

48:27.822 --> 48:29.615
Tomorrow night, so, yeah.

48:30.658 --> 48:32.368
- Extra large?
- Yeah.

48:32.451 --> 48:33.744
Wow, um...

50:36.283 --> 50:38.536
Do you want to come
like a little bit closer?

50:43.582 --> 50:44.416
So...

50:44.708 --> 50:45.543
Um...

50:46.835 --> 50:49.296
You know, I was thinking about
that monkey of yours...

50:58.931 --> 51:00.558
Oh, Jesus.

51:00.933 --> 51:04.103
- Wow. Uh, that was a nice surprise.
- What am I doing? Why did I do that?

51:04.728 --> 51:06.814
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't apologize.

51:06.897 --> 51:08.399
I should go. I'm gonna go.

51:08.482 --> 51:10.609
- Hey, Alex, just calm down for one minute.
- Calm down?

51:10.693 --> 51:11.902
I have a girlfriend,

51:11.986 --> 51:14.113
who I am supposed to be
losing my virginity to

51:14.196 --> 51:15.739
in approximately 29 hours.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.866
Wow, this is so not part of the game plan.

51:17.950 --> 51:20.119
Sometimes you need to alter the game plan.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.538
Look, if I led you on or something,
I'm really sorry.

51:22.621 --> 51:23.872
Wait. No, no, no, you kissed me.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.416
Yeah, like you didn't want me to?

51:25.499 --> 51:27.918
"Ooh, Alex, let's go for a drive.

51:28.002 --> 51:32.089
Oh, Alex, why don't you come to my room,
and I'll do a gay B-52's dance for you.

51:32.172 --> 51:34.341
Oh, Alex, why don't you come
and sit on my bed?"

51:34.425 --> 51:36.343
- Where you kissed me.
- Yeah.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.263
I gave you what you wanted.

51:41.015 --> 51:41.974
Alex...

51:42.600 --> 51:44.977
You are one confused kid, you know that?

51:46.729 --> 51:48.355
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:49.565 --> 51:50.733
What? Alex.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.236
You hear from Columbia yet?

51:54.612 --> 51:56.739
No, you'll be the first to hear when I do.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.950
I still think
you could have gotten into Yale.

52:00.034 --> 52:01.410
Class President, for God's sake.

52:01.493 --> 52:04.872
- Seems silly you didn't even apply.
- Yeah, well, I didn't.

52:04.955 --> 52:08.083
Seems like the only way to guarantee
you won't get in is by not applying.

52:08.167 --> 52:09.084
Ron.

52:09.168 --> 52:10.586
- I'm just saying...
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

52:10.669 --> 52:13.797
- You're shooting yourself in the foot.
- Thanks, Dad, that's super helpful.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.215
Hey. Watch the attitude.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.301
Why don't you get off my back?

52:17.384 --> 52:18.427
Alex.

52:19.011 --> 52:20.971
- What is going on?
- Nothing?

52:21.639 --> 52:23.932
I just... I have
a really big test tomorrow.

52:25.351 --> 52:26.226
In Physics?

52:28.687 --> 52:30.189
Yeah. Physics.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.151
Well, I'm sure you're going to ace it.

52:41.950 --> 52:44.078
- Something's wrong.
- No, nothing's wrong, dude.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.497
- She's been in there forever.
- She's been five minutes.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.082
Oh, here she comes, here she comes.

52:57.549 --> 52:58.467
Okay? So?

52:59.343 --> 53:02.304
- You're all set, you little lovebirds.
- Thank God.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.640
It's room 231.
Checkout is tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

53:04.723 --> 53:06.558
Just make sure to clean up your mess.

53:06.642 --> 53:09.436
Shut the fuck up, fucktard.
No one thinks you're fucking funny.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.063
Who asked you, Princess Scabies?

53:11.146 --> 53:12.564
Watch your mouth, cum weasel.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.775
I left a meeting for this. You're welcome.

53:14.858 --> 53:16.568
- Whore's Anonymous?
- Suck my anus.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.654
As much as I love gonorrhea...

53:18.737 --> 53:20.364
Okay, I think we're gonna go.

53:20.447 --> 53:22.825
Oh, my God, Claire,
it was a pleasure meeting you.

53:22.908 --> 53:24.159
Yes, it was.

53:24.243 --> 53:26.161
And Alex, break your legs.

53:26.453 --> 53:27.287
Thanks.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.081
Good luck, my friend.

53:29.164 --> 53:29.998
Whoo!

53:30.749 --> 53:32.459
Now drive me home, woman.

53:54.940 --> 53:55.816
Not bad.

53:56.442 --> 53:57.943

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

Mmm.

You're so beautiful.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.692
You're not too bad, yourself.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.070
Oh, baby.

56:11.451 --> 56:12.619
What?

56:14.204 --> 56:15.080
Uh...

56:16.415 --> 56:18.625
Did you just say "touch my balls?"

56:18.709 --> 56:20.002
Yeah, so?

56:20.085 --> 56:21.628
What?

56:22.212 --> 56:24.214
- I'm sorry.
- I was talking dirty.

56:24.298 --> 56:25.841
I know, I know. It was adorable.

56:25.924 --> 56:27.885
It's not supposed to be,
it's supposed to be sexy.

56:27.968 --> 56:29.386
I know, I'm sorry. I've just...

56:29.469 --> 56:31.805
- I've never heard you talk dirty before.
- Well...

56:32.180 --> 56:34.349
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56:37.477 --> 56:38.312
Um...

56:40.439 --> 56:41.398
Do you...

56:42.190 --> 56:44.109
want me to touch your balls now?

56:44.192 --> 56:45.527
Never mind.

56:45.611 --> 56:47.988
It's not sexy when you say it like that.

56:48.655 --> 56:50.240
Mmm. I'll play with your balls.

56:52.034 --> 56:53.535
I'll also suck your cock.

56:53.619 --> 56:54.870
Oh, okay.

57:01.335 --> 57:02.210
Oh.

57:06.131 --> 57:07.049
Okay.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.509
Okay, this ain't so bad.

57:10.052 --> 57:12.137
- What did you say?
- Uh, nothing, nothing.

57:20.604 --> 57:21.813
Okay, let's do it, let's do it.

57:21.897 --> 57:22.940
- You ready?
- Yeah.

57:23.023 --> 57:24.358
- You have a condom?
- Yeah.

57:34.326 --> 57:35.327
Okay.

57:35.410 --> 57:36.453
Hang on a second.

57:38.497 --> 57:39.623
Hold on, hold on.

57:41.708 --> 57:42.542
Crap.

57:42.626 --> 57:44.252
Oh, no, that doesn't sound good.

57:45.879 --> 57:47.047
I might need a second.

57:47.631 --> 57:48.715
That's okay.

57:51.510 --> 57:52.761
The condoms are...

57:52.844 --> 57:53.720
Yeah.

57:57.432 --> 57:59.101
Hey, in the meantime...

58:00.852 --> 58:03.563
why don't I do
a little something-something-something?

58:09.444 --> 58:11.238
Alex.

58:11.321 --> 58:13.824
- Is that in the right general area?
- Yeah.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.661
Oh!

58:17.744 --> 58:18.704
Yeah, right there.

58:18.787 --> 58:20.747
- Oh, ah-ha! That wasn't so hard to find.
- Yeah.

58:20.831 --> 58:22.916
- Okay, stop talking, Alex.
- Don't know why everybody...

58:25.002 --> 58:25.961
Yeah.

58:26.545 --> 58:28.964
- How about if I speed it up a little?
- Don't talk, just do it.

58:29.047 --> 58:29.881
Okay.

58:34.594 --> 58:36.263
- I want you inside of me.
- Okay.

58:36.346 --> 58:37.889
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

58:37.973 --> 58:39.933
Semi-ready, if that makes sense.

58:40.225 --> 58:41.601
- Yeah, let me help.
- Okay.

58:56.783 --> 58:57.784
Okay, I'm ready.

58:58.368 --> 58:59.369
- Yeah.
- Okay.

58:59.453 --> 59:00.287
Let's do it.

59:08.295 --> 59:09.296
Wow.

59:10.464 --> 59:12.549
We are officially having sex.

59:12.632 --> 59:14.009
Yes. Stop talking.

59:24.728 --> 59:26.021
Kind of weird, huh?

59:26.605 --> 59:27.439
What?

59:28.523 --> 59:30.859
It's kind of weird having sex
with your best friend.

59:32.986 --> 59:34.029
Why is it weird?

59:34.905 --> 59:35.781
Just...

59:36.698 --> 59:37.824
No, it's not weird.

59:37.908 --> 59:40.660
It's just... I just meant
we were friends before, and...

59:41.495 --> 59:42.621
Now we're dating.

59:44.081 --> 59:44.915
Right.

59:45.707 --> 59:46.541
Mmm.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.585
- What's weird about it?
- Nothing.

59:49.503 --> 59:51.088
Nothing, it's not weird.

59:52.589 --> 59:53.423
It's a...

59:54.299 --> 59:56.301
It's a poor choice of words.
Let's just keep going.

59:56.384 --> 59:57.969
You know what? Forget about it.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:00.972
What's going on?

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.099
What do you mean?

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:04.434
You don't seem into this
and I want to know why.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.353
I am into this. I just...

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.771
- What?
- We just...

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:10.273
Are you not feeling well?
Are you nervous?

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:11.566
- Are you gay?
- Oh.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.193
The gay card. Nice.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.529
Why is that
the automatic assumption when...?

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:18.323
When you're not into havin sex
with your girlfriend?

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:19.241
Gee, I don't know.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.659
I want to have sex with you.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.828
- You could have fooled me.
- Okay. Fine.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.454
I'm gay. I'm a big gay homo

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:27.165
because I'm smart
and I'm a little neurotic and...

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.501
And you don't want to have sex
with your girlfriend.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.503
Why are you so obsessed with sex?

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.296
Why is everyone so obsessed with sex?

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.550
Have you ever stopped to think
that maybe I like someone else?

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:41.012
No, I...

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.098
never stopped to think that.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:47.477
That came out wrong.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:50.522
Who is it?

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.235
I can't tell you.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.126
Claire.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.419
You have to leave.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.337
- Claire, please.
- Please go.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.966
- Should I just pick...
- Get out of here, Alex!

01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:58.924
Hi.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.178
I don't want to bug you, but, um...

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.514
you got a letter from Columbia.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.034
Can I be alone, please?

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:31.665
Sure.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:54.688
Mr. President.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.191
Mr. President.

Alex.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:02.487

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:04.823

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:24.801

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:25.844
Hey. What?

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.013
Hey, giving me the silent treatment?

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:29.723
So?

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.224
So what?

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.810
Come on. Don't play dumb, dude.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.939
I think we broke up, actually, so...

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:41.359
- Whoa.
- I'm fucking over it, Dell.

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:42.277
The whole thing.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.739
Fuck sex, fuck love, fuck it all.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.032
I'm... I'm out.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.954
<i>Lost and separated from the herd,</i>

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.873
<i>it is just a matter of time</i>

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:57.542
<i>before the baby elephant
dies of starvation.</i>

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.093
Whoa, whoa!

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.262
Fuck.

01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:12.057
Dell.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:16.061
So, your brilliant plan
was to stage a home invasion,

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.896
with monkey masks,

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:19.856
kidnap me and take me to a frat party?

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.233
I advised against the monkey masks.

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.860
What? I love the monkey mask.

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:26.112
I figured a little monkey mask action

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:28.281
would shake you
out of your funk, Truelove.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:31.493
Never thought you'd go all Liam Neeson
and smash my face in.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:34.829
Wow, jeez, I guess your foolproof plan
had a flaw in it.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.247
What else were we supposed to do?

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.291
You never would have come
if we'd just asked you.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:41.252
- I'm still not gonna come.
- Goddammit, Alex.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:43.922
Let me give it to you straight.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:47.884
You are so far up your own ass,
and it's fucking depressing.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:48.927
Excuse me?

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:53.431
You're coming with us to this party,
which has booze and slutty girls and...

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.267
Booze and slutty girls.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:59.646
And you're gonna let your little
constipated hair down and enjoy yourself.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.066
In case you forgot, Dell,
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.568
Okay? So I'm sorry
if I'm not in the "Let's party" mood,

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:08.321
and honestly, I'm really, really sick
and tired of this,

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.782
"Let's get you laid, Alex" routine.
I'm not into it.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.576
Whoa, who said anything
about getting you laid, Truelove?

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.911
Clearly, that's impossible.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.913
In fact, I never want to hear

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:20.083
about your flaccid
little micropenis ever again.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:23.211
I don't give a shit if you get laid
or if you don't get laid,

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:27.215
or if you're bisexual, asexual, pansexual,
or if you join fucking NAMBLA.

01:05:28.216 --> 01:05:29.217
And as for Claire,

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.677
I'm sorry you broke up.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.221
But it was kind of inevitable.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.474
What do you mean?

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.977
Everyone breaks up
when they go to college.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:41.104
You guys just got a head start on things.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.235
Hey...

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.362
I'm sorry to be harsh, dude,

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.322
but... but it's the truth, all right?

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:53.408
And... and you know what?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.243
Fuck it.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:58.288
Right now, the only thing
we should be giving a shit about

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:02.542
is like having fun before we all go
off to college and forget...

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.503
that this is actually
a really great time in our lives.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:09.591
So, sack up, Truelove,

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:11.509
and meet us out in the car in three.

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.262
He has a point.

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:15.597
Right, Josh?

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.641
Poor little elephant.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:23.396
Fuck this noise.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.648
We've wasted enough time
on that granny turd.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.239
I'm in.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.783
Get in the car before I kick your dick in.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.831
Now that I'm thinking about it,
Claire has been holding me back.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.584
I can't be with one girl for the rest
of my senior year.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.212
I should be playing the field
with the ladies, plural.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.672
Know what I'm talking about?
Get some notches on the bedpost.

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:50.632
Bust some nut.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:53.051
- Yeah, let out some population paste.
- Yeah.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.969
Have a cream dream, baby.

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:56.846
Yeah, get some bitches pregnant.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.558
- Sorry, I was trying something out.
- It's okay.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:04.103
Oh, my God,
it's the whole nutsack brigade.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:07.190
Alex, how was
your little hotel fuck festival?

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.984
- It could not have gone better.
- Actually, Claire and I broke up.

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:11.819
And now, I'm looking for sluts.

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:12.779
You know of any?

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.614
Do I look like your regional pimp?

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.241
More like an employee.

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:18.618
Delbert, I'm choking on the vomit
of your hilarity.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.496
- Oh, they have clinics for that, actually.
- Will you guys get a room?

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.123
Now I'm choking on vomit.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.010
Let's party!

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.137
Oh, yeah!

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.014
Come, on baby, come on.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:58.032
Yeah!

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.649
You're sexy.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.027
You are sexy.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.321
You're a sexy little sex kitten.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.115
What are you, like, 12?

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.910
No, I am of the legal sex age
in the state.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:44.495
I looked it up.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.122
Oh, yeah?

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.122
Yeah.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.377
You want to see what's upstairs?

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.462
Fuck yeah.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:08.560
Frankly, I don't even know why
we bother with high school boys.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.564
I, personally, haven't touched one
since freshman year.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:16.069
I mean, sure, Alex is maybe smarter
than the average boy,

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.071
but he's still just as useless.

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:19.363
I don't get it.

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:22.617
I mean, Alex has always been
weird and shy about sex,

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.287
but I never got any sense
that he was interested in anyone else.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:28.956
Well, something's definitely going on.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.251
We could stalk him.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.259
No question, dolphin. I'd fuck a dolphin.

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:41.719
I'd fuck a unicorn.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:43.388
No way, it can't be imaginary.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.596
- Why not?
- Why not?

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.265
Because then I'd fuck Arwen
from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.893
Dude, Arwen's an elf, not an animal.

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:50.603
Yeah, you fucking idiot.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.189
I thought you guys
were gonna try to meet girls.

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:57.402
- We are.
- It's fine, we are.

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:59.529
Yeah, we're just pumping each other up.

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:01.030
You're killing it.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:03.449
We met so many girls before this.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.201
There were a bunch of them here...

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:06.244
Holy shit.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.749
Miss Sophie Hicks.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:15.586
I'd fuck a cute little
fucking furry panda bear.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.428
I can't wait either.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:26.097
I feel like
we really haven't talked in ages.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:27.932
See you soon, Delbert.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.520
They're at a frat party on Mickley Avenue.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:33.938
Done.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:42.780
You're... you're sexy.

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:44.615
I like touching your face.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:45.533
What?

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:46.451
Nothing.

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:48.786
Can you take your shirt off, please?

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:49.746
Okay.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.415
Whoa! Look at those honkers.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:53.541
- Honkers?
- Yeah.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:57.044
Or what, do you prefer "hooters"
or just good old-fashioned "tits"?

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:58.421
You're funny.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.798
You are chewing gum.

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:01.883
Yeah. You want some?

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:02.842
I'm okay.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:04.719
Okay!

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.513
It's lost it's flavor a little bit,
but that's okay.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:08.765
I want you to fuck me.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.017
Can do.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.477
Oh, yeah? Do you have a condom?

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.437
Yeah, I do. Yeah, in my pants.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.773
- Get it.
- Okay, yeah. Sure.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:25.281
<i>Don't overthink this.
Would Dell overthink this?</i>

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.533
<i>No, Dell would say...</i>

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.076
Slurp my nutsack.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.077
Shut up, Dell.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.121
- Huh?
- Nothing. Found it.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:34.665
She'd better be hot

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.793
She'd better be
the Mother of fucking Dragons.

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.878
Claire, this is Alex we're talking about.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.380
He and Dell are probably standing
by themselves in a corner,

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:44.884
talking about which <i>Lord of the Rings</i>
character they'd want to have sex with.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.640
So, I'm all, "Fine, bitch,
go and fuck any dude here.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.517
I don't give a shit."

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.894
And she's all, "Fuck you, I'm going home."

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.854
And I'm all, "Adios, slut."

01:11:58.231 --> 01:11:59.690
You know what, bro?

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:01.776
I really do love her.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:03.611
Hey, Dell.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:05.321
Sophie.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:07.198
Wow, you made it.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:08.449
Wow.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:09.492
Hi.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.869
Oh, Claire Bear. Hey.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:14.539
Sophie told me
this is where the action is tonight.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.791
Funny, did she?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.086
Sophie did not mention you'd be coming.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:21.921
Where's Alex?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.715
Man, that's a...
that's a really good question.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:26.133
I don't really...

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:29.929
No, Claire, I've got to tell you,
I think he's really drunk...

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:33.266
I should go help her look.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:34.851
See you, Dell.

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.185
Yeah.

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:37.687
Right. See you.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.941
- Oh, fuck me, baby.
- I know.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.026
- Oh, fuck me hard.
- I know, I'm trying.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.070
- Fuck me!
- Okay, here I go.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:47.029
Hang on a sec.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:51.826
Oh, come on, mister class president.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.077
Just a sec. I'm trying.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.707
- Maybe you're getting shy?
- No.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.792
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.502
You are a hot, sexy chick,

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:05.339
and I'm gonna ejaculate my erect penis
inside your wet vagina if it kills me.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:06.716
- Excuse me?
- Okay, here we go.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:08.593
Come on, little penis.
Get in there.

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.011
- Hey!
- Come on, little guy.

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:12.597
Jesus, get off me, you creepy weirdo!

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.226
Alex?

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:18.811
Claire.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.063
Ever heard of knocking, bitch?

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.566
Shut the door, this isn't a fucking show.

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:27.528
Claire, wait!

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:30.865
Sierra?

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:33.409
- Dakota?
- You guys know each other?

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.077
You said you were going home.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.538
Yeah, well, I decided to take
a little detour, fuck stick.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.124
Well, obviously you guys have
some problems to work out. So...

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:42.793
- What'd you do to my girl, piece of shit?
- Not much.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:45.338
Yeah, she's right,
I could barely get it up, so no big deal.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:47.340
Wait, I'm naked!

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:52.386
Hey, guys.

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:55.389
- Get out of my way.
- Dakota, stop!

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.517
Hey, douchebag.

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.647
You want him,
you've got to get through me first.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:15.910
I'm sorry, Dell. Thank you so much.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.752
You see them jump, babe?

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:25.711
I'm the shit.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.630
You're so hot, babe.

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:29.423
No, babe, you're hot as fuck.

01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:49.485
A Guyana banana leaf toad?

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:51.654
What?

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:53.739
Claire!

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:00.621
Claire!

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:04.542
Claire!

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:14.552
Dell?

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:17.930
What happened?

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:20.349
What do you care?

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:24.020
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.605
And if I did see Claire,
why would I tell you?

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:29.692
Dell.

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:31.652
You're an evil person, Sophie Hicks.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:33.571
Evil, evil, evil.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.531
- Oh, I'm evil?
- Yes.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:36.532
Yes.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:40.077
Because I helped my best friend
find her bastard boyfriend?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:43.205
No. No, you're evil
because you tricked me.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.126
You know
that I've liked you since... forever.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:52.298
And I know that I'm just a joke to you,
okay? I'm not an idiot.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:56.093
Girls like you have this ultimate power
over guys like me.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:16:00.514
But it doesn't give you the right
to fuck with my feelings.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.018
It's not cool, Sophie.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.736
- You're right.
- It's not cool.

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.616
- I'm sorry, Dell.
- Not cool.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:26.832
Hey, uh...

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.794
I want to show you something.

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:40.763
Oh, you... you kept those.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:44.683
Of course I did.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:48.395
I mean, I think they're
the most adorable thing I've ever seen.

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:53.526
I could send you updated versions.

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:55.486
Yeah...

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:57.863
- Let's take it one step at a time.
- Okay.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:16:59.949
- Sound good?
- Sounds good.

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:01.242
Yeah.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:10.876
Claire!

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:18.676
That's Josh's frog.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:23.180
That's Josh's frog.

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.142
Come here. Come here.

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:42.408
No, no, no, no...

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:43.951
Don't jump.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:47.329
No!

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:48.747
Oh God.

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:58.234
Dude. Oh, my God.

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.153
- Alex has a boner.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:03.364
Why do you have a boner, Alex?

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:05.491
I, I... No, I don't.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:06.742
Are you a fag?

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:08.619
No, I'm not...

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:10.621
Alex has a boner. He's a fag.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:12.706
Oh, my gosh, yeah.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.500
Where you going, Alex?

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.252
Are you gonna cry?

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:20.422
Just let me go!

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:23.175
Oh, he's gonna cry, he's gonna cry.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.073
Alex?

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.367
Jesus, what happened to you?

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:31.994
Oh, you know.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.247
Just went for a little swim.

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:36.874
Are you okay?

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:38.876
Yeah.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.294
Yeah.

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:43.213
Claire...

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:47.343
I'm gay.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:51.180
What?

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:52.931
I'm gay.

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:55.017
You called it.

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:57.811
I'm gay.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.193
I'm sorry.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:08.614
I'm really sorry.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.320
Claire.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:51.990
Are you okay?

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:10.926
Hey, honey.

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:12.386
Did you have fun?

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:16.640
Sweetie?

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:20.811
Oh.

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:29.319
I got you.

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:33.157
Let it out.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.533
Oh.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:24.416
So...

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.131
The person you like...

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:35.177
It's a boy?

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:42.226
That kid Elliot?

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:49.483
And, um...

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:51.610
Did you just...

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:53.362
figure all this out?

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.991
I guess it's always been there. I just...

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.911
had to be honest with myself.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.872
I just couldn't ignore it anymore.

01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:06.250
Maybe you're just going through a phase.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:07.709
No, I thought of that.

01:24:08.835 --> 01:24:11.421
But, you know,
I thought I'd grow out of it, and...

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:15.008
thought I'd get over it.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:19.513
You know...

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.057
I thought I'd meet the right girl.

01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:26.395
But, uh...

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:36.029
You know, I met the right girl.

01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:51.628
Alex, don't people know
who they're attracted to?

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:53.171
I mean...

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.424
isn't it just obvious?

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.301
It's different when...

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:58.594
When you're gay?

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:00.596
No, it isn't.

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.933
My cousin just came out and she's 12.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.561
What are you so scared of?

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:11.064
Losing you.

01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:26.288
I love you.

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:31.084
I'm sorry I was such a shitty boyfriend.

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:32.252
No.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.255
No, you're the...

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:38.300
best gay boyfriend a girl could have.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:43.388
That's funny.

01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:46.975

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.306
I know you know.

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:10.016
I'll never tell, Delgado.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.143
Never.

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:12.602
Alex.

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:14.730
Hey.

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:23.739

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.615

- I invited him.

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:27.159
I didn't think you'd mind.

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.494
No, no, I don't, but...

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:35.333
Look, guys, I knew you'd never do this
yourselves, so here I am...

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.502
just passing the baton.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:40.172
Claire.

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:42.466
I came here with you. You're my date.

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:47.179
I know, but Alex,
you've got to start sooner or later.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.514
And...

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.477
I think maybe this is a good for me too.

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:03.904

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:06.281
No, go dance with your fella.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.551
I had to figure some stuff out.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:29.221

Hey, everyone.

01:31:39.244 --> 01:31:43.123
Uh, welcome to a very special episode
of <i>Savage Kingdom High.</i>

01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:44.249
I'm Alex,

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:48.003
and with me, as always, of course,
is my partner in crime

01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:50.505
and very best friend in the whole world.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:53.258
Hello, interwebs.

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:56.011
And we are here to spin you a tale

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.054
of intrigue, drama...

01:31:58.596 --> 01:31:59.472
and comedy.

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:01.641
Um, Claire, and I used to date.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:05.478
<i>Uh, today I'm gonna be sharing
my coming out experience.</i>

01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:07.313
<i>I wasn't out in high school at all.</i>

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:10.025
<i>Uh, I dated a bunch of girls, very...</i>

01:32:10.108 --> 01:32:15.280
<i>Uh, it all starts out
when I was about 13, 14, and...</i>

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.656
<i>I'm gay!</i>

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:19.242
<i>It feels so good to say that.</i>

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:22.495
<i>I think I was in denial
for most of my adolescence...</i>

01:32:22.579 --> 01:32:24.748
<i>It's not that I want to be,
it's that I am.</i>

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:27.167
<i>I... I've been dating a guy.</i>

01:32:49.606 --> 01:32:51.024
This is Alex Truelove...
