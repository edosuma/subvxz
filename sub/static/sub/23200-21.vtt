00:14.564 --> 00:16.651
The New Adventures of WONDER WOMAN

01:26.786 --> 01:30.082
That fast?
Well, you're going to have to prove it.

01:45.937 --> 01:48.189
The Boy Who Knew Her Secret - Part 2

02:35.628 --> 02:37.464
You must tell me the truth.

02:39.591 --> 02:43.472
I already know you're from another world,
and that there are 99 of you.

02:43.556 --> 02:47.560
- Why have you come here?
- An enemy is hiding here.

02:48.311 --> 02:50.773
- What kind of enemy?
- A murderer.

02:50.940 --> 02:54.486
Eight hundred people on one planet alone
died because of him.

02:54.862 --> 02:58.158
Well, you're gonna have to take
your little war somewhere else.

02:58.242 --> 03:01.413
If you prevent us from capturing him,
others will come.

03:01.496 --> 03:03.666
We have a job to do.

03:04.041 --> 03:06.378
And the souls of the beings we're using...

03:06.461 --> 03:09.172
cannot return
until we've accomplished our goal.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.050
Not one moment before.

03:11.843 --> 03:16.516
All right, who is it that you're after?
Whose body is he inhabiting?

03:18.602 --> 03:19.728
Answer me.

03:22.983 --> 03:24.652
He's not like us.

03:25.236 --> 03:28.282
He can become whatever he wants,
whenever he wants.

03:28.365 --> 03:29.993
Are you telling me you're after someone...

03:30.076 --> 03:33.038
who can disguise himself
as anything or anyone?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.375
How are you going to find him?

03:35.458 --> 03:38.838
He's in danger as long as we're here.
He'll find us.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.176
You've put me in a very bad position.

03:43.593 --> 03:46.932
I have no choice but to let you
and the others go about your business.

03:47.015 --> 03:49.143
However, you will pass the word along...

03:49.226 --> 03:51.980
that Diana Prince,
Skip Keller, and Cameron Michaels...

03:52.063 --> 03:55.192
have become one of you. Understood?

03:58.614 --> 04:00.408
You're to leave them alone.

04:01.159 --> 04:05.581
And you will also forget
everything that we have talked about.

04:45.260 --> 04:47.680
- Skip?
- In here.

04:49.932 --> 04:53.521
Cameron, the man who was with me,
did he come back?

04:53.813 --> 04:55.941
I haven't seen him. What happened?

04:57.192 --> 05:00.321
He can become whatever he wants,
whenever he wants.

05:01.156 --> 05:02.658
Let's not talk here.

05:03.325 --> 05:05.662
- Why not?
- I'll explain later.

05:05.954 --> 05:09.750
- Is there someplace else we can go?
- My hideout. Right outside of town.

05:09.834 --> 05:12.045
- It's not far. I'll show you.
- Good.

05:18.304 --> 05:21.307
You're sure they'll leave us alone
when they get what they want?

05:21.391 --> 05:25.021
- That's what he said.
- How'd you get him to tell you all this?

05:25.480 --> 05:28.860
I can be very persuasive
when I put my mind to it.

05:29.610 --> 05:33.365
In any case, if we can make them believe
that we're one of them...

05:33.658 --> 05:36.662
they'll leave us alone.
Think you can fake it?

05:36.745 --> 05:39.708
It doesn't seem like
they communicate telepathically.

05:39.791 --> 05:43.504
Pete or whoever he is now
will just think somebody else got to us.

05:43.588 --> 05:46.675
- Which reminds me-
- If you don't mind.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.970
I'd like to keep it for myself.

05:50.054 --> 05:52.725
It's the only way
I can control things I got.

05:54.185 --> 05:58.899
Okay. Everything is going to
work out just fine. You have my word.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.194
First thing tomorrow,
I'll call Washington...

06:01.278 --> 06:03.573
and get some outside help, okay?

06:05.909 --> 06:09.080
- Time to flip the tape.
- You've been recording all this?

06:09.164 --> 06:10.540
It's my diary.

06:10.665 --> 06:13.669
It's better than writing things down
where people can see it.

06:13.752 --> 06:15.338
I want to be a writer.

06:16.590 --> 06:20.762
Over here are my notes:
two years of stuff I feel, think, see.

06:21.054 --> 06:25.310
I don't ever think I'll be a writer.
It's just something to dream about.

06:27.062 --> 06:30.608
A person becomes
whatever he or she really wants to be.

06:30.692 --> 06:33.446
That's a little-known law of nature...

06:33.529 --> 06:36.241
but if you want to be a writer,
you'll be one.

06:36.616 --> 06:40.748
Especially if you keep reading things like
Shakespeare, Tennyson...

06:41.457 --> 06:44.169
Dostoyevsky? Not bad.

06:44.961 --> 06:48.758
I sneaked them out of my dad's library.
I don't want him to know.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.554
I let him and everyone else think
I'm a dummy.

06:51.679 --> 06:52.805
Why?

06:53.472 --> 06:57.312
In case I never make something of myself,
I won't let anyone down.

06:57.937 --> 07:00.733
It's kind of like my secret identity,
you know?

08:32.606 --> 08:34.649
Only four more to be recovered.

08:35.107 --> 08:38.697
Pass the word to deliver them
for assembly as soon as possible.

08:39.364 --> 08:43.160
That's him! He's here spying on us.

09:08.653 --> 09:10.990
He knows it won't be much longer.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.099
Look, operator, I've been trying to call
Washington for the past 12 hours.

09:30.183 --> 09:32.602
Don't tell me the lines are still down?

09:33.604 --> 09:36.316
Then put me through
to an operator in New York...

09:36.399 --> 09:38.694
and let them patch me through.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.531
So what's the closest city I can call?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.369
Spare me the fancy rhetoric, operator.

09:45.453 --> 09:48.373
It's quite obvious what is really going on.

09:49.791 --> 09:51.377
Never mind my name.

09:54.465 --> 09:55.799
I still can't get through.

09:55.883 --> 10:00.139
Seems Crystal Lake is in the middle of the
biggest communications breakdown ever.

10:00.222 --> 10:03.060
Two things would make me feel
a whole lot better, Doctor.

10:03.143 --> 10:06.731
One is to find out that this communication
snarl-up is a coincidence.

10:06.814 --> 10:10.695
It's no coincidence.
It's an extremely well-calculated measure.

10:11.613 --> 10:14.909
A precaution against
any outside interference.

10:15.493 --> 10:18.789
The second thing
is to hear just what this is all about.

10:18.872 --> 10:21.250
Who doesn't want outside interference?

10:21.334 --> 10:23.837
- I can't say.
- You can't say?

10:24.254 --> 10:28.761
I can't send in local authorities to help
Diana without giving them a reason.

10:29.178 --> 10:32.015
I can appreciate the awkwardness
of your position, Colonel.

10:32.098 --> 10:34.393
I should hope so. You put me there.

10:34.477 --> 10:38.190
But were I to tell you what I know,
and were you to believe me...

10:38.982 --> 10:43.697
the chances are simply too great that
word would leak out to the general public.

10:44.490 --> 10:48.996
I believe that the general public has a lot
more brains than it's given credit for.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.414
As do I.

10:50.957 --> 10:54.545
But unfortunately,
the bureaucrats they've put in office...

10:54.629 --> 10:59.218
would no doubt find it politically expedient
to do something about the situation...

11:00.053 --> 11:03.265
the consequences of which
would be catastrophic.

11:03.349 --> 11:05.100
According to you.

11:06.436 --> 11:08.648
Yes, according to me.

11:13.487 --> 11:15.948
- Yes?
- Someone here to see Dr. Jaffe.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.951
All right, send him in.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.455
There's someone to see you, Doctor.

11:25.462 --> 11:27.297
Here they are, Dr. Jaffe.

11:27.422 --> 11:30.218
- They were right where you said they'd be.
- Thank you.

11:30.301 --> 11:33.263
Col. Trevor,
my assistant, Cameron Michaels.

11:33.597 --> 11:35.266
It's a pleasure.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.192
- Mel, you've been faking it, too?
- Long story.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.363
I've been spying on them,
figuring out what they're up to.

12:16.446 --> 12:18.282
It's so good to have someone to talk to-

12:18.366 --> 12:21.495
They need those weird rocks
for something, I don't know what for.

12:21.578 --> 12:24.916
- But they don't have them all.
- They're not gonna get it, either.

12:24.999 --> 12:26.710
You've got one? Where?

12:26.835 --> 12:29.422
I've got it hidden.
I'm gonna use it for a ransom.

12:29.506 --> 12:31.341
- Listen-
- Where have you got it hidden?

12:31.424 --> 12:32.843
I've got to tell you something.

12:32.927 --> 12:36.348
There's a lady from Washington.
I met her yesterday on the horse trail.

12:36.431 --> 12:38.184
Better keep walking.

12:47.404 --> 12:49.407
We'll meet somewhere later.

13:29.419 --> 13:32.256
So much for finding a phone
down the road.

14:20.278 --> 14:22.073
Not this time, you don't.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.843
Just proving a theory, Ms. Prince.

16:43.011 --> 16:44.346
That's all.

16:48.561 --> 16:52.315
Skip, there are only four more
to be recovered.

16:52.524 --> 16:56.529
They must be brought to the old barn
at County Line Road immediately.

16:57.197 --> 16:58.824
Yeah, sure.

17:02.036 --> 17:04.999
Mel, we gotta arrange
some place to talk, okay?

17:08.044 --> 17:09.880
Drop the act, will you?

17:11.299 --> 17:13.635
And what's this about the old barn?

17:21.980 --> 17:23.148
Sunny.

17:36.833 --> 17:40.714
- Pete was wrong. Skip's not one of us.
- Don't bother.

17:41.089 --> 17:42.591
He knows too much.

17:42.674 --> 17:46.221
It won't be hard for the others
to remove him permanently.

18:06.790 --> 18:08.750
- Who is it?
- Cam.

18:12.464 --> 18:16.845
- Where on earth have you been?
- Running for my life. Just like you, right?

18:17.470 --> 18:20.099
No need,
if you pretend you're one of them.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.977
See, they don't know the difference.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.564
Now you tell me. I could use a
drink.

18:24.647 --> 18:27.151
Of water, I hope. That's all that's here.

18:27.234 --> 18:29.946
- Do just fine.
- There's some ice water in the pitcher.

18:30.030 --> 18:31.114
Thanks.

18:36.288 --> 18:38.082
If I had known where you were staying-

18:38.166 --> 18:40.084
- Care for some?
- Thanks.

18:41.879 --> 18:43.923
If I'd known where you were staying...

18:44.007 --> 18:46.426
we could've gotten together
to compare notes.

18:46.509 --> 18:51.057
- That's right. I never told you, did I?
- No, you didn't.

18:55.939 --> 18:57.482
Here you go.

18:58.985 --> 19:00.320
Thanks.

19:00.570 --> 19:02.990
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.872
- Where are you staying?
- A motel.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.626
I could've sworn I tried them all.

19:11.710 --> 19:14.297
- Which one?
- Down the road.

19:17.301 --> 19:19.971
You know they have roadblocks set up?

19:20.722 --> 19:24.311
I decided that trying to bluff my way past
was too risky.

19:24.394 --> 19:27.565
- How've you been getting in and out?
- Wasn't difficult.

19:35.033 --> 19:38.329
Sit down, Diana.
Tell me what you've been doing.

19:45.922 --> 19:50.220
I think I would rather have you tell me
why you just did that.

19:51.513 --> 19:54.267
You haven't fit all the pieces together yet?

19:57.313 --> 19:59.232
Maybe we should review them.

20:04.488 --> 20:08.494
I'm sure the alien you caught up with
in the woods yesterday told you...

20:08.578 --> 20:11.749
that he and all the others...

20:14.294 --> 20:16.297
are here to capture an enemy...

20:18.799 --> 20:20.469
from their planet.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.436
Right, Diana?

20:29.189 --> 20:31.442
Here, you really should sit down.

20:36.239 --> 20:39.995
I'm sure he told you that
this person can change his form at will.

20:42.248 --> 20:46.295
He can become a mouse, or a cat...

20:46.378 --> 20:48.757
or somebody who's become close to you.

20:49.090 --> 20:51.969
You see, he's quite diabolical,
quite ruthless.

20:52.053 --> 20:54.097
Which, I suppose, is the reason why...

20:54.181 --> 20:57.769
the authorities on his planet
are so determined to destroy him.

21:00.564 --> 21:04.027
You still haven't answered my question.

21:05.321 --> 21:06.655
I'm sorry.

21:07.823 --> 21:09.409
The tetrahedrons, when reassembled...

21:09.492 --> 21:12.622
into the object you saw
in the good doctor's sketches...

21:12.705 --> 21:16.043
can imprison him long enough
to return him for sentencing.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.922
It is therefore in his best interest...

21:19.757 --> 21:21.925
to prevent their reassembly.

21:23.261 --> 21:24.596
How?

21:26.557 --> 21:29.686
By compelling our little friend Skip...

21:29.770 --> 21:32.356
to relinquish the fragment that he has...

21:32.899 --> 21:35.360
probably by now the only one they need.

21:35.444 --> 21:37.155
And how does he do that?

21:41.452 --> 21:43.121
That's right, Diana.

21:43.205 --> 21:45.248
By becoming
the only person in the world...

21:45.332 --> 21:48.169
he and everyone else trusts
without question.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.756
Yes, that was me this afternoon...

21:50.839 --> 21:54.720
testing a little theory I've had
since our first encounter in the garage...

21:54.803 --> 21:57.474
concerning your true identity...

21:58.892 --> 22:00.436
Wonder Woman.

22:01.979 --> 22:05.902
It could be worse, Diana. I could kill you.

22:07.070 --> 22:11.283
But it would be so much easier
if you simply forgot who you really are.

22:11.743 --> 22:14.747
That's the reason
for the hypnotic drug, Diana.

22:18.793 --> 22:21.088
In order for me to become her...

22:24.593 --> 22:27.764
you're about to forget
you're Wonder Woman.

22:38.070 --> 22:39.780
We're only missing one.

22:41.199 --> 22:43.827
One piece and he's ours.

22:45.245 --> 22:47.749
We've scoured every inch of countryside.

22:47.874 --> 22:51.003
By count, all 99 have been recovered.

22:51.212 --> 22:53.215
Yet only 98 are here.

22:53.882 --> 22:57.721
Which means
someone who is not one of us has it.

22:58.055 --> 23:01.809
If it's him, we've failed.
We'll be here forever.

23:03.019 --> 23:05.189
In any case, we've got to find out.

23:07.651 --> 23:09.362
No, I'm not surprised.

23:09.445 --> 23:13.116
I'd react the same way
if he called me with that kind of request.

23:14.409 --> 23:17.121
No, I can't explain.
That's the whole problem.

23:17.622 --> 23:19.833
Yeah. Thanks, anyway.

23:19.917 --> 23:21.211
Colonel?

23:29.722 --> 23:33.435
Still no word from her, Dr. Jaffe.
No way to get help to her.

23:34.269 --> 23:37.649
I'm on my way to Crystal Lake.
I thought I'd let you know.

23:38.442 --> 23:39.944
Keep in touch.

23:41.112 --> 23:44.450
If I hadn't distrusted my own findings,
I wouldn't have...

23:51.751 --> 23:52.878
No.

23:58.761 --> 24:00.262
The truth is...

24:01.181 --> 24:03.975
had I not been so frightened
with my own life...

24:04.227 --> 24:06.562
I would've gone in the first place...

24:06.854 --> 24:09.691
and spared your agency
and your operative.

24:11.027 --> 24:12.195
I'm sorry.

24:18.955 --> 24:20.164
Doctor...

24:21.082 --> 24:25.046
for whatever reasons you made her go,
bring her back.

24:36.686 --> 24:39.232
Hi, Skip. Come on in. What are you up to?

24:39.357 --> 24:40.900
About 5'9".

24:40.983 --> 24:44.196
- Listen, I've been spying on them-
-5'9". That's cute.

24:44.279 --> 24:46.032
Standard comeback line.

24:46.115 --> 24:49.536
It seems to me they're building
a pyramid thing out of those rocks-

24:49.620 --> 24:51.373
I'll have to remember that one.

24:51.456 --> 24:52.791
Diana, are you listening?

24:52.874 --> 24:56.505
This pyramid thing seems to be
some sort of weapon or something.

24:57.339 --> 24:58.883
What are you doing?

24:58.966 --> 25:01.762
I'm packing.
I gotta get back to Washington.

25:02.221 --> 25:03.639
- You're leaving?
- Yep.

25:03.722 --> 25:06.726
My boss called me
and says I have to be back there tonight.

25:06.810 --> 25:10.440
Your boss? I thought
you couldn't get through to Washington.

25:10.690 --> 25:14.445
- I didn't. He got through to me.
- How could he?

25:14.529 --> 25:18.283
All the long-distance lines are screwed up.
You told me so yourself.

25:18.367 --> 25:22.164
Skip, I distinctly remember
talking to my boss on that phone.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.462
- There's something the matter with you.
- Thanks a lot.

25:27.545 --> 25:30.550
Diana, you can't leave.
You've got to stay here and help me.

25:30.634 --> 25:33.763
You're the only one
who can get things back to normal.

25:33.930 --> 25:36.767
Diana, I know you're really-

25:44.819 --> 25:49.408
Hi, I'm Bill Keller.
I saw my son's bike outside and thought...

25:49.909 --> 25:52.204
- You are here.
- Come in. I'm Diana Prince.

25:52.287 --> 25:54.207
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

25:54.290 --> 25:56.544
Your mother's been worried sick.

25:56.794 --> 25:58.754
Diana, it's a trick.

25:59.422 --> 26:03.302
I just saw him at the old barn
where they're building that thing.

26:05.222 --> 26:09.227
- Skip, is he your father or isn't he?
- Yes, but...

26:10.812 --> 26:12.606
No, he's one of them.

26:14.567 --> 26:18.531
Come on, stop this nonsense, son.
Let's go home.

26:19.156 --> 26:20.242
No.

26:23.663 --> 26:27.042
Diana, please help me.
I don't understand what's happening.

26:49.322 --> 26:51.492
I'm sorry, he's very high-strung.

27:41.267 --> 27:43.102
End of the trail, Skip.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.607
It would've been so much easier
if you'd cooperated.

27:47.108 --> 27:48.693
Now it's too late.

27:49.861 --> 27:52.490
You're about to meet with
a tragic accident.

27:52.782 --> 27:54.617
There are less than 100 of you.

27:54.701 --> 27:56.954
What're you gonna do,
knock off the whole town?

27:57.037 --> 27:59.624
The rest of the town
doesn't know anything.

27:59.749 --> 28:02.211
They think that it's a virus going around.

28:02.294 --> 28:05.799
But you know better, don't you? Too bad.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.845
Take care of it.

28:16.856 --> 28:18.024
Do it.

28:19.651 --> 28:23.030
You do something to me,
you'll never complete that pyramid.

28:26.118 --> 28:30.165
That's right,
I've got the 99th piece. Hidden.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.299
Where?

28:40.345 --> 28:43.099
First, we play Let's Make a Deal, right?

29:00.539 --> 29:03.543
You can't leave.
You've got to stay here and help me.

29:03.626 --> 29:06.755
You're the only one
Who can get things back to normal.

29:17.687 --> 29:21.526
Now that they know I have it,
they'll probably never leave me alone.

29:21.651 --> 29:25.948
So I guess I'll deliver it to the place
I told Pete, or whoever he is...

29:27.200 --> 29:31.289
and hope he keeps up his end of
the bargain by not having me eliminated.

29:32.290 --> 29:34.418
I don't have a real big choice.

29:35.377 --> 29:38.339
As for Diana,
I don't know what happened to her.

29:38.757 --> 29:42.762
It's like, all of a sudden,
she turned off to everything going on here.

29:42.846 --> 29:44.682
Like she just didn't care.

29:46.767 --> 29:49.312
Anyway, she's probably gone by now.

29:49.396 --> 29:50.857
Well, here I am.

29:59.118 --> 30:01.287
I've never been so alone in my life.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.433
Man, I never thought I'd see you again.

30:17.017 --> 30:20.604
I came for the rock that you have.
I need to take it with me.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.525
Sure. Boy, am I glad to see you.

30:23.608 --> 30:27.030
I met Pete up on the bike path
and they were gonna get rid of me.

30:27.113 --> 30:29.867
I have promised
that I'll give it back to them.

30:30.033 --> 30:33.163
Well, you're safe now.
Will you give me the rock?

30:33.246 --> 30:35.875
You were acting so strange
back at the motel.

30:38.336 --> 30:42.426
I guess I'd better tell you.
I know your secret.

30:43.719 --> 30:45.179
You what?

30:50.019 --> 30:54.233
I found out by accident. I saw you
at the stables when you chased after Pete.

30:54.317 --> 30:56.486
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

30:57.112 --> 31:00.074
Skip, I wanted to tell you...

31:01.743 --> 31:03.579
Give me the rock, Skip.

31:04.038 --> 31:05.373
Wonder Woman.

31:07.250 --> 31:09.795
I had no idea you kept such company.

31:10.463 --> 31:12.132
Give me the rock, Skip.

31:33.995 --> 31:35.705
Skip, what's wrong?

32:03.075 --> 32:06.955
- Skip, what is the matter with you?
- I'm just going nuts, that's all.

32:07.039 --> 32:10.793
Everything's upside down, backwards,
not the way it's supposed to be...

32:10.877 --> 32:12.671
and no one's around to explain why.

32:12.755 --> 32:15.467
- Let me try to help.
- You're the worst part, Diana.

32:15.550 --> 32:18.179
One day, you promise
you'll end this whole nightmare.

32:18.262 --> 32:20.807
Next day, you act as if
you don't know what's happening.

32:20.891 --> 32:22.809
What're you trying to do to me?

32:22.893 --> 32:25.354
My boss said there was nothing more
to worry about.

32:25.438 --> 32:27.149
Nothing to worry about?

32:27.232 --> 32:30.862
My best friend is out to get me,
they're out at the barn on County Line...

32:30.945 --> 32:34.450
putting those rocks into something
that's suppose to destroy somebody...

32:34.533 --> 32:37.455
you're getting long-distance calls
on phones that don't work-

32:37.538 --> 32:38.914
Skip, calm down.

32:39.373 --> 32:42.794
And I just saw you and Wonder Woman
at the same time.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.381
I saw you, Diana.

32:45.840 --> 32:50.013
I saw you change and chase after Pete.
I know you're Wonder Woman.

32:52.475 --> 32:55.353
- That's ridiculous.
- Will you stop it, Diana?

32:55.437 --> 32:57.690
Will you stop it and leave me alone?

33:04.157 --> 33:07.161
Diana, help me.
I don't understand What's happening.

33:09.748 --> 33:11.708
Skip, neither do I.

33:31.985 --> 33:34.489
Why don't I just get it all over with?

33:50.761 --> 33:52.972
It shouldn't be a young boy.

33:54.390 --> 33:56.435
It should be an old man...

33:56.810 --> 33:59.814
who spent a lifetime
watching and listening...

34:00.815 --> 34:03.569
and unraveling
the mysteries of the stars...

34:04.279 --> 34:06.281
without ever taking part.

34:08.451 --> 34:09.619
Don't!

34:13.666 --> 34:15.585
This is the way it should be.

35:14.039 --> 35:16.876
I thought
you couldn't get through to Washington.

35:17.585 --> 35:19.421
He got through to me.

35:20.130 --> 35:23.968
All the long-distance lines are screwed up.
You told me so yourself.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.849
So what's the closest city I can call?

35:29.518 --> 35:31.896
There's something the matter with you.

35:33.649 --> 35:36.653
My boss said there was nothing more
to worry about.

35:36.736 --> 35:38.738
What're you trying to do to me?

35:38.863 --> 35:41.909
My boss said
there's nothing more to worry about.

35:41.992 --> 35:45.206
You're the only one
Who can get things back to normal.

35:46.582 --> 35:50.128
If you prevent us from capturing him,
others will come.

35:51.964 --> 35:54.301
My best friend is out to get me.

35:55.636 --> 35:57.388
I distinctly remember...

35:57.722 --> 35:59.934
Diana, it's a trick.

36:01.435 --> 36:03.605
I gotta get back to washington.

36:03.855 --> 36:05.483
I saw you, Diana.

36:05.775 --> 36:07.985
You see he's quite ruthless.

36:08.904 --> 36:10.949
I saw you change.

36:13.117 --> 36:15.245
That was me this afternoon.

36:17.123 --> 36:19.042
I know you're Wonder Woman.

36:21.295 --> 36:23.131
I could kill you.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.635
I know you're really-

36:26.427 --> 36:29.389
You're about to forget
you're Wonder Woman.

37:38.232 --> 37:41.903
You fools! Don't you know
how many have preceded you...

37:42.445 --> 37:45.741
have chased me from galaxy to galaxy
through eons of time?

37:46.284 --> 37:47.953
And to no avail.

37:49.997 --> 37:52.251
You're here to bring me back
for sentencing...

37:52.334 --> 37:54.211
but it's you who've been sentenced!

37:54.294 --> 37:55.380
You...

37:56.089 --> 37:59.301
and all those hapless creatures
whose bodies you're using...

37:59.385 --> 38:01.554
sentenced to death at my hand.

38:04.392 --> 38:08.021
No one will ever capture me.

38:09.232 --> 38:11.234
That remains to be seen.

38:12.026 --> 38:16.282
You see, you didn't get rid of me after all.
You slipped up.

38:17.242 --> 38:21.039
That's what usually happens
at the beginning of the end.

38:21.540 --> 38:25.169
The beginning of the end for whom,
Wonder Woman?

42:24.322 --> 42:26.617
Everybody's okay,
but they don't remember a thing.

42:26.701 --> 42:28.244
What are we gonna do?

42:28.327 --> 42:30.622
Well, we're not gonna do anything.

42:30.706 --> 42:34.419
I think it's best that
everybody forgets everything, don't you?

42:36.088 --> 42:37.674
Sure, but I...

42:38.300 --> 42:39.968
We all need our privacy.

42:40.051 --> 42:43.055
You have your tree house,
I have Diana Prince.

42:43.557 --> 42:46.853
Someday, somehow, it could slip out,
couldn't it?

42:50.983 --> 42:54.029
- Can I still be friends with Diana?
- Of course.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.532
In fact, you two will be seeing
a lot of each other.

42:56.615 --> 42:57.659
Really?

42:57.743 --> 43:00.454
Word is she's gonna be
on permanent assignment...

43:00.538 --> 43:02.915
in Los Angeles by the end of the month.

43:03.417 --> 43:06.629
- We'd make a great team.
- Her thoughts exactly.

43:07.589 --> 43:10.801
- All right.
- All right.

43:13.430 --> 43:16.684
What do you mean you can't tell me
about your trip to Crystal Lake?

43:16.767 --> 43:19.104
I can't. I can't remember.

43:19.187 --> 43:21.816
That's just what Dr. Jaffe said.
How about that?

43:21.899 --> 43:24.153
I guess we both can't remember.

43:25.154 --> 43:28.950
Diana, do you realize how frustrating
these past three days have been?

43:29.034 --> 43:32.873
I had no idea what had happened to you,
no way to get in touch, nothing-

43:32.956 --> 43:37.545
Steve, I know. I'm sorry.
But I'm back now and everything's okay.

43:39.923 --> 43:42.051
Seeing as though you are
a government employee...

43:42.135 --> 43:45.723
and your trip to Crystal Lake
was financed by the American taxpayers...

43:45.806 --> 43:48.935
you have a report to dictate. Good luck.

43:50.521 --> 43:51.814
I'll need it.

43:58.156 --> 43:59.950
It's good to have you back.

44:11.090 --> 44:12.550
You've been recording all this?

44:12.634 --> 44:13.969
It's my diary.

44:14.261 --> 44:17.766
It's better than writing things down
Where people can see it.

44:24.775 --> 44:28.780
Today I found out
that Diana Prince is really Wonder Woman.

44:31.367 --> 44:32.660
Wonder Woman?

45:25.273 --> 45:26.816
