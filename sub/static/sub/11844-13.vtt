17:44.229 --> 17:46.163
So you have two choices, all right?

17:46.231 --> 17:48.359
You can let her in on the whole

17:48.433 --> 17:52.097

from the dusty corners of her brain...

17:52.170 --> 17:54.969
OI' YOU can--

17:55.040 --> 17:59.705
- No. That's not gonna work, so you have that

- You're not capable of it, I promise.
-just say it.

Okay, fine. What kind of psychobabble

18:24.969 --> 18:26.994
I can't put the words

18:27.072 --> 18:29.268

It's got to come from whatever organ
you have sitting in for your heart.

18:32.177 --> 18:35.169

he didn't recognize me.

- A split personality?
- Grant Sorenson may have turned in the rifle...

29:39.844 --> 29:42.870
but the person thatjumped me earlier today
is the one who fired it.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.575
Well, that's an interesting theory, Sheriff.

29:45.649 --> 29:49.415

32:46.530 --> 32:51.229
<i>This is Maria, and this is
Mr. Dupree's granddaughter, Laurie.</i>

33:17.227 --> 33:19.423
Hi.

33:41.985 --> 33:45.785
<i>Laurie! Is it really you, Laurie?</i>

33:50.760 --> 33:53.457
Where's Grandpa?

33:53.530 --> 33:56.124
Oh, my God.

33:56.199 --> 33:59.829
<i>[ Woman] Bobby, you do remember
we have that function...</i>

33:59.903 --> 34:02.804
<i>at the Bonhofis later this afternoon,
don't you?</i>

34:02.873 --> 34:05.035
I mean, really, you can't be
trotting around the polo grounds...

34:05.108 --> 34:09.341
<i>for the whole afternoon
and expect me to do all--</i>

34:14.284 --> 34:16.309
Who are-

34:16.386 --> 34:18.377
What is it?

34:20.357 --> 34:23.815
Aunt Mary, I want to see
my grandfather right now.

34:26.096 --> 34:29.554
He's dead, Laurie.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.830
He's been dead for seven years.

34:32.902 --> 34:36.396
<i>You were at his funeral,
for God's sakes.</i>

34:45.148 --> 34:47.480
<i>[Bobby]
Spooky. I mean, it's just spooky.</i>

34:47.550 --> 34:49.643
“Typical“ is more like it.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.188
Daddy always did have
that wandering eye.

34:52.255 --> 34:54.587
Looks like hejust wandered off
the marital reservation...

34:54.658 --> 34:57.992
and left us all a little surprise.

34:58.061 --> 34:59.995
And I love surprises.

35:04.134 --> 35:09.595
Carmen! Would you draw a bath
and get Miss Laurie's room ready?

35:09.673 --> 35:11.698
Go on, Laurie.

35:11.775 --> 35:14.608
Why don't you go upstairs.

35:15.745 --> 35:18.407
<i>It's okay.
I'm not going anywhere.</i>

35:29.259 --> 35:31.227
And, uh, what is ityou want, Mr.-

35:31.294 --> 35:34.958
Guerin. Michael Guerin.
Look, your daughter has been-

35:35.031 --> 35:39.798
Niece. She's our niece, Mr. Guerin.

35:39.869 --> 35:42.566
Well, your niece has been through
a pretty traumatic experience.

35:42.639 --> 35:44.630
<i>Somebody kidnapped her.</i>

35:44.708 --> 35:48.201
<i>They buried her in the ground,
and we think that he's still after her.</i>

35:48.278 --> 35:50.610
Oh, well, that's quite a story.

35:52.515 --> 35:54.745
Why don't Laurie's hospital records
list you as the next of kin?

35:54.818 --> 35:59.085
- What <i>hospital?</i>
- <i>[Maria ] The P/necrest Psychiatric Institute.</i>

35:59.155 --> 36:03.023
Brownfield, Texas,
where Laurie's been living for the past-

36:03.093 --> 36:05.824
I don't know- what, three--
three years?

36:05.895 --> 36:08.626
Oh, well, we haven't seen
our niece in years.

36:08.698 --> 36:10.826
So someone finally put her away, huh?

36:10.900 --> 36:13.733
Did the aliens chase her there too?

36:13.803 --> 36:16.101
You know, aliens are chasing
our family, Mr. Guerin.

36:16.172 --> 36:20.118
<i>Don't stay too long.
They might get you too.</i>

36:20.143 --> 36:21.304
<i>Don't stay too long.
They might get you too.</i>

36:21.378 --> 36:23.312
<i>He has about 50 experiments
going on in Frazier Woods...</i>

36:23.380 --> 36:26.543
all of which he explained to me
in excruciating detail.

36:26.616 --> 36:29.847
- But the common thread through each one
is the water table. - What about it?

36:29.919 --> 36:32.411
The woods are unusual because
the water's so close to the surface.

36:32.489 --> 36:34.480
<i>In some places, it's less than
three feet below ground.</i>

36:34.557 --> 36:37.458
lfthe parasites really are waterborne,
and that's just a theory...

36:37.527 --> 36:39.495
they might be in the water table.

36:39.562 --> 36:42.327
<i>But how would alien parasites get
in the water table in the first place?</i>

36:42.399 --> 36:47.997
<i>Okay, this is a map of the water table
for the entire county.</i>

36:48.071 --> 36:51.507
- [ Max] It looks like a bunch of rivers.
- Yeah, that's basically it.

36:51.574 --> 36:54.339
<i>The water flows from
one area to anotherm.</i>

36:54.411 --> 36:57.472
through a system of
underground rivers and streams.

36:57.547 --> 37:01.347
- <i>Frazier</i> Woods. - <i>So the stream passes
right underneath the gra ve site.</i>

37:01.418 --> 37:04.251
Let's see the rest of that stream.

37:08.124 --> 37:10.354
- Oh, my God.
- What?

37:11.761 --> 37:13.786
<i>Do you know what that is?
That's Pohlman Ranch.</i>

37:13.863 --> 37:17.493
- [Isabel] The <i>crash</i> site.
- Yeah. The stream passes right beneath it.

37:17.567 --> 37:20.195
That means that the parasites
might've been on our ship.

37:20.270 --> 37:23.638
Somebody kidnaps a girl
and buries her in the ground...

37:23.706 --> 37:26.607
so a bunch of alien parasites can-

37:26.676 --> 37:29.168
I mean, can do what to her?
We don't know.

37:29.245 --> 37:32.510
<i>And then how does he know
about these parasites?</i>

37:32.582 --> 37:35.210
<i>Is he human or is he alien?</i>

37:35.285 --> 37:38.220
Are these things dangerous
to normal people in Roswell?

37:40.723 --> 37:42.714
Okay, where do we go from here, Max?

37:42.792 --> 37:46.490
- I have <i>absolutely no idea.</i>
- <i>We needhe/p.</i>

37:46.563 --> 37:49.589
I wish you guys could just phone home.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.327
Wouldn't that be nice.

37:51.401 --> 37:54.860
Max, Could you-
Oh, hello.

37:54.938 --> 37:59.034
Sorry. We werejust using some of
the equipment for a science project.

37:59.109 --> 38:01.077
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, of course not.

38:01.144 --> 38:03.112
Can you let me know
when you're done?

38:03.179 --> 38:05.546
- We won't be long.
- Okay.

38:12.122 --> 38:14.853
Max, didn't you say that there was
an alien at the summit...

38:14.924 --> 38:17.450
that reached out with his mind
and possessed Brody's body?

38:17.527 --> 38:20.360
- Right.
- What if that connection goes both ways?

38:20.430 --> 38:23.889
What if we can send a signal
back through Brody?

38:32.475 --> 38:34.409
That rifle was reported stolen...

38:34.477 --> 38:38.038
by a hunter in Newcastle, Wyoming,
injuly...

38:38.114 --> 38:40.606
and the oxygen tanks used
to keep the girl alive...

38:40.683 --> 38:44.051
were stolen from a hospice
in Fort Collins, Colorado, in August...

38:44.120 --> 38:46.179
and the plastic box around her head...

38:46.256 --> 38:50.124
was taken from an industrial supply warehouse
in Las Cruces in September.

38:50.193 --> 38:51.558
And?

38:51.628 --> 38:54.962
This is Grant Sorenson's work itinerary.

38:55.031 --> 38:59.662
He was in all those places at the times
those items were reported stolen.

38:59.736 --> 39:03.570
Chalk up another one
for the woodworking detective.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.871
Look, you seem to know
more about this than anyone.

39:06.943 --> 39:10.675
Why? I'm not sure.
But I need to settle this case...

39:10.747 --> 39:13.114
<i>and you want to be sheriff again.</i>

39:13.183 --> 39:17.620
<i>You help me close this one, and I will make it
my business to get you your job back.</i>

39:20.990 --> 39:22.924
I guess the bats can wait.

39:25.862 --> 39:28.797
<i>I don? like it.</i>

39:28.865 --> 39:30.799
What, the tile?

39:30.867 --> 39:33.461
No. The fact that we haven't
seen Laurie in three hours.

39:33.536 --> 39:35.470
[Sighs]

39:37.840 --> 39:42.334
- This can't be good.
- This is yours.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.544
- What's this?
- $50,000.

39:46.616 --> 39:48.710
<i>- What?
- And that's all you're going to get.</i>

39:48.785 --> 39:51.049
You may look like our father...

39:51.120 --> 39:53.782
but we'll fight any further
paternity and inheritance claims...

39:53.856 --> 39:55.790
every step of the way.

39:55.858 --> 39:58.156
I'm not here to make
an inheritance claim.

39:58.228 --> 40:00.697
<i>Wait. How big of an inheritance claim
are you talking about?</i>

40:00.763 --> 40:04.893
Please escort Mr. Guerin
and his friend off the property.

40:04.968 --> 40:07.494
- Wait a minute. What about Laurie?
- We'll take care of her now.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.538
Hey! No, you don't understand!
There are people after her!

40:09.606 --> 40:12.576
<i>Oh, right. The aliens.</i>

40:12.642 --> 40:14.633
Well, we'll keep
on the lookout for them.

40:14.711 --> 40:16.839
You can't do this!

40:27.223 --> 40:31.126
- [Gates Closing]
- Now what?

40:31.194 --> 40:34.095
I don't know, but I promised Laurie
I'd protect her...

40:34.163 --> 40:37.827
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.392
I've been put under hypnosis before.

40:40.470 --> 40:43.167
It's never helped me remember
anything about my experiences.

40:43.239 --> 40:46.539
This would be different.
I have a gift. Um-

40:46.609 --> 40:48.771
I'm a little psychic.

40:52.282 --> 40:54.910
- <i>Come on!</i>
- <i>You believe in aliens...</i>

40:54.984 --> 40:56.952
but you don't believe
in psychic phenomena?

40:57.020 --> 40:59.853
I was abducted by aliens.
I know they exist.

40:59.922 --> 41:02.289
I know my gift exists.

41:02.358 --> 41:05.623
<i>Aren't you at least curious?</i>

41:07.297 --> 41:09.459
Okay, so what do we do?

41:11.234 --> 41:15.467
Relax. Close your eyes
and clearyour mind.

41:18.041 --> 41:20.203
Give me your hand.

41:22.011 --> 41:25.208
- This won't hurt.
- I just wanna warn you...

41:25.281 --> 41:27.215
the last time I was put through this...

41:27.283 --> 41:30.309
I was a very difficult subject.

41:30.386 --> 41:32.946
<i>I just don't want you to be
too disappointed when--</i>

41:36.659 --> 41:40.095
- Isabel!
- [ Groans]

41:40.163 --> 41:42.097
<i>- [Electricity Crack/mg]
- I'm okay.</i>

41:42.165 --> 41:44.099
[ Brody]
You shouldn't have done that.

41:46.402 --> 41:49.997
- Brody?
- La rek.

41:50.073 --> 41:54.909
This body has not been prepared
for communication. Its heart has stopped.

41:56.979 --> 41:59.277
It may restart once I've released him.

41:59.349 --> 42:01.647
- What is it you want?
- We need your help.

42:01.718 --> 42:06.417
We think that some form of parasite
was released into our Earth's ecosystem...

42:06.489 --> 42:08.514
<i>when our ship crashed 5O years ago.</i>

42:08.591 --> 42:10.525
- We think they're dangerous.
- When you say “parasite,“

42:10.593 --> 42:14.860
do you mean the gandarium from your ship
have escaped into the ecosystem?

42:14.931 --> 42:17.593
I don't know.
It looks like blue crystals.

42:17.667 --> 42:21.160
Earth is in serious trouble.
You must leave now.

42:21.237 --> 42:23.934
What are you talking about?

42:24.006 --> 42:26.270
<i>Earth has become infected.
You're no longer safe there.</i>

42:26.342 --> 42:29.710
Get off the planet now.

42:31.381 --> 42:33.349
Oh, God.

42:33.416 --> 42:35.350
No, Max!

42:41.724 --> 42:44.284
[Gasping]

42:53.236 --> 42:55.466
What happened?

42:55.538 --> 42:57.472
You fainted.

43:05.281 --> 43:07.773
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

43:07.850 --> 43:11.252
- I'm so sorry.
- You sure you're all right?

43:11.320 --> 43:13.345
I think so.
