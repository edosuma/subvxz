00:06.928 --> 00:09.574
Are you sure you've corrected the problem, Dr. Sinclair?

00:09.610 --> 00:11.458
Absolutely, Mr. Luthor.

00:12.223 --> 00:16.589
The simulations have all been positive.
Increasing thermal variance by 98%

00:16.617 --> 00:19.595
should eliminate the separation impurity.

00:20.044 --> 00:22.889
Six months of this,
and all you had to do was turn up the heat?

00:24.250 --> 00:27.153
Well, it's not that simple, Mr. Luthor.

00:27.182 --> 00:30.433
I mean, the composition of these
meteor rocks is highly unusual.

00:30.462 --> 00:32.984
Calculating the exact temperature was a challenge.

00:33.003 --> 00:34.697
One I hope you're up to.

00:34.719 --> 00:37.878
If this works, I'll leave a mark on the world
no one will ever forget.

00:38.421 --> 00:40.615
It won't hurt your bank account, either.

00:44.564 --> 00:46.348
Initiating sequence.

00:48.668 --> 00:50.950
Thermal sequence initiating.

00:57.316 --> 00:58.961
Increasing thermal output.

00:59.510 --> 01:00.869
70%.

01:01.370 --> 01:02.845
Come on, come on...

01:02.873 --> 01:05.747
Approaching optimum thermal reaction.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.704
Opening the irradiation samples.

01:14.072 --> 01:17.428
Subject seeds exposed to radiation.

01:17.570 --> 01:18.685
90%.

01:19.290 --> 01:21.398
Absorption level as expected.

01:22.634 --> 01:26.585
Irregular molecular stimulation noted in subject seeds.

01:26.614 --> 01:28.211
95%.

01:29.090 --> 01:32.167
98%. Power objective attained.

01:32.639 --> 01:35.483
Molecular activity exceeding control model.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.167
Thermal level continues to accelerate.

01:38.196 --> 01:40.709
- Thermal levels exceeding safety parameters.
- What's happening?

01:40.737 --> 01:43.535
The temperature is climbing past the target range.

01:43.564 --> 01:44.413
Shut it down.

01:44.432 --> 01:45.519
I'm trying, sir. I'm trying.

01:45.547 --> 01:48.638
Thermal levels exceeding safety parameters.

01:49.121 --> 01:50.436
Get outta here!

02:22.362 --> 02:23.703
Doc, are you okay?

02:31.906 --> 02:33.635
I'm calling this one a failure.

02:34.335 --> 02:36.859
Come on Dr. Sinclair, I'll get you in a hospital.

www. forom. com

03:46.964 --> 03:48.056
Lex, are you okay?

03:48.079 --> 03:48.890
Clark,

03:49.264 --> 03:50.444
I'm fine.

03:50.632 --> 03:52.172
How did you know I was here?

03:52.351 --> 03:56.277
One of your EMTs is a friend of mine.
She said there was an explosion at Luthorcorp?

03:56.295 --> 03:57.168
What happened?

03:58.361 --> 04:00.212
We were conducting an experiment.

04:00.249 --> 04:01.818
Well, I'm guessing it didn't go well.

04:01.846 --> 04:05.019
Not exactly as I hoped, but it was worth the risk.

04:05.198 --> 04:06.766
I'm sure it was...

04:07.518 --> 04:09.594
To Luthorcorp's bottom line.

04:09.922 --> 04:11.328
To the world, Chloe.

04:12.249 --> 04:14.077
Look, why don't the two of you come with me to the lab,

04:14.113 --> 04:16.995
and I'll show you what Dr. Sinclair and I
have been working on?

04:21.670 --> 04:23.680
I really think you're gonna like this one.

04:26.977 --> 04:28.399
All right, let's go.

04:28.747 --> 04:33.584
Clark, wait, I'm not buying any story
from a Luthor without corroboration.

04:33.612 --> 04:37.547
So I'm gonna go talk to Dr. Sinclair
and find out what he has to say about this.

04:37.606 --> 04:40.095
Okay. I'll check out the lab with Lex.

04:40.142 --> 04:43.876
Just be careful, okay?
I mean, no matter what he says,

04:43.911 --> 04:46.575
Luthorcorp experiments never end well.

04:58.860 --> 04:59.912
Wow...

05:00.968 --> 05:02.917
That looks like it hurts.

05:04.126 --> 05:05.641
What happened?

05:06.827 --> 05:09.224
Well, I was hoping you could tell me.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.148
There was an explosion.

05:12.277 --> 05:15.283
Do you remember anything else after the accident?

05:15.647 --> 05:17.534
Anything unusual?

05:17.902 --> 05:20.098
Like what?

05:20.896 --> 05:22.834
Like seeing two of me?

05:24.759 --> 05:25.884
What?

05:25.943 --> 05:30.475
I think the explosion caused some kind of separation...

05:31.062 --> 05:34.303
A division at the molecular level.
I don't know, but...

05:34.467 --> 05:37.085
I saw myself, Doctor.

05:38.259 --> 05:41.136
I saw another Lex Luthor.

05:43.226 --> 05:44.482
My God.

05:45.856 --> 05:47.943
What about reversing it?

05:48.577 --> 05:51.795
Is there any way to force the two "me"s back together?

05:52.088 --> 05:55.716
My research notes are back in the lab. If...

05:55.796 --> 05:58.145
If I had those...

05:58.180 --> 06:02.489
I might be able to find a way to reverse the process.

06:07.119 --> 06:09.044
I'm gonna go back to the lab

06:09.878 --> 06:11.686
and get the notes.

06:16.465 --> 06:17.887
In the meantime,

06:21.057 --> 06:23.065
why don't you get some rest?

06:45.076 --> 06:45.991
Lex?

06:47.081 --> 06:47.776
Chloe.

06:47.811 --> 06:49.852
I thought you left for the lab with Clark.

06:49.981 --> 06:52.740
Well, I just wanted to check in on Dr. Sinclair first.

06:52.775 --> 06:54.466
Hmm. Was he all right?

06:54.971 --> 06:56.556
Not feeling a thing.

06:57.319 --> 06:59.970
Well, I was hoping I could maybe talk to him.

07:00.334 --> 07:03.023
Well, he's sleeping now.

07:04.643 --> 07:08.446
Maybe you should come back later...
When he's feeling a little more alive.

07:08.505 --> 07:09.031
Okay.

07:09.078 --> 07:13.471
Code blue - room 213.
Code blue - room 213.

07:22.619 --> 07:24.790
He's arresting. Fibrillator.

07:36.937 --> 07:40.072
This is what your secret experiment was about... Gardening?

07:40.107 --> 07:41.305
No, Clark,

07:41.469 --> 07:43.207
it's about the future.

07:43.606 --> 07:45.555
These are growing in common sand,

07:45.602 --> 07:47.995
with only a few drops of water as irrigation.

07:49.662 --> 07:53.290
If my dad planted a crop of these,
he'd never have to worry about the harvest again.

07:53.326 --> 07:55.228
Until it arrived on your dinner table.

07:56.633 --> 07:57.549
Taste it.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.234
Those were grown from irradiated seeds.

08:04.383 --> 08:06.717
- Something's wrong. It tastes...
- ... rotten?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.549
That's what we've been wrestling with.

08:08.584 --> 08:11.848
See, we've successfully destroyed the genes
that make a plant weak,

08:11.881 --> 08:14.817
giving it the ability to thrive
under the harshest conditions.

08:14.876 --> 08:18.562
But the process also affects the fruit it bears,
and not for the better.

08:19.831 --> 08:22.429
Is that what you were trying to fix
when the explosion happened?

08:22.992 --> 08:27.501
Dr. Sinclair thought increasing the temperature
of the reaction would solve the problem.

08:27.994 --> 08:32.044
We pushed it further than we ever have, Clark,
but the meteor rock became unstable.

08:32.087 --> 08:34.058
What, you're working with meteor rocks again?

08:34.106 --> 08:36.606
If I can find a way to make this work,

08:36.640 --> 08:40.116
Luthorcorp could put an end to hunger and famine forever.

08:40.386 --> 08:44.688
I'm hoping there's something in Dr. Sinclair's notes
that'll explain exactly what went wrong.

08:53.330 --> 08:54.598
Clark, are you all right?

08:54.927 --> 08:55.768
Yeah, um,

08:56.402 --> 08:59.244
I don't think that apple's sitting very well.
I'll wait for you outside.

09:17.533 --> 09:18.402
Lex.

09:19.928 --> 09:22.323
I haven't forgotten. I know I'm...

09:22.429 --> 09:26.102
I'm not welcome here,
but I heard there was an accident at Luthorcorp,

09:26.149 --> 09:28.568
and I wanted to be sure you were all right.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.129
I'm fine, dad.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.663
Thanks for the concern.

09:34.413 --> 09:35.728
Well, I'm...

09:37.125 --> 09:40.037
I'm grateful you're all in one piece.

09:41.284 --> 09:43.856
Sorry. I'm sorry for the intrusion.

09:43.926 --> 09:44.948
Dad...

09:48.153 --> 09:50.255
Are you still planning on your

09:50.290 --> 09:52.332
charity fundraiser saturday?

09:52.367 --> 09:53.224
Yes.

09:54.140 --> 09:58.191
I must say, it's quite an interesting challenge trying to...

09:58.226 --> 10:02.897
Get the deep pockets to show up
for a salad bar and ginger chicken.

10:03.461 --> 10:06.948
Would it help if the head of Luthorcorp
promised to make an appearance?

10:07.911 --> 10:08.824
Really.

10:09.105 --> 10:10.420
You'd do that?

10:11.231 --> 10:12.957
Under one condition.

10:13.724 --> 10:14.811
Oh.

10:16.068 --> 10:20.950
You hold the event on the top floor
of Luthorcorp plaza in Metropolis.

10:22.148 --> 10:26.234
I'll even reach out to a few of those reluctant deep pockets.

10:26.739 --> 10:29.293
That's very generous of you.

10:29.805 --> 10:32.119
Oh, you must be rubbing off on me.

10:35.868 --> 10:40.392
I admit, I had my doubts about the motives
behind your sudden philanthropy,

10:40.792 --> 10:44.874
but I can see how much joy
helping the less fortunate is bringing you.

10:45.429 --> 10:46.462
Dad, I'm...

10:48.515 --> 10:50.053
I'm proud of you.

10:56.881 --> 10:58.713
Thank you, Lex.

11:00.521 --> 11:02.247
I'm truly grateful.

11:04.677 --> 11:06.045
For everything.

11:31.535 --> 11:33.754
Amazing work, isn't it?

11:36.055 --> 11:37.229
Hello, me.

11:42.510 --> 11:44.353
Meet the real you.

12:07.140 --> 12:10.064
Well, I can't have you running about, can I?

12:10.651 --> 12:11.861
Who are you?

12:12.072 --> 12:16.181
Well, that's a question
I've been struggling with for years.

12:16.674 --> 12:19.410
Hey, remember the last time we were in this room?

12:20.279 --> 12:24.306
Dad told us not to play down here,
but I whispered in your ear to do it anyway?

12:24.717 --> 12:26.505
The door blew shut,

12:27.984 --> 12:30.145
locking me in. No one could hear me.

12:30.297 --> 12:32.728
You were so afraid.

12:34.219 --> 12:35.705
A scared,

12:35.893 --> 12:37.948
trembling child.

12:39.110 --> 12:41.118
I hated you for that.

12:41.341 --> 12:42.621
My god...

12:43.079 --> 12:44.321
You're me.

12:44.356 --> 12:46.212
No, Lex.

12:46.411 --> 12:48.454
I'm much, much more.

12:57.074 --> 12:58.847
The explosion in the lab...

12:58.882 --> 13:00.632
freed me from your weakness.

13:01.183 --> 13:03.997
At last, I can embrace my true destiny.

13:08.294 --> 13:11.042
Yeah! Come on! Come on! You can do it!

13:11.300 --> 13:13.226
Stop me! Come on!

13:17.673 --> 13:19.223
You disappoint me.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.203
As always.

13:23.649 --> 13:26.092
If I'm such a letdown, why don't you just kill me?

13:27.527 --> 13:29.664
Nothing would make me happier.

13:30.075 --> 13:33.679
Unfortunately, I don't know
what will happen to me if you die.

13:33.806 --> 13:36.095
Are we somehow still connected?

13:36.366 --> 13:40.851
Would I cease to exist...
as you gasp your last breath?

13:43.587 --> 13:45.869
I'm not keen on taking that chance.

13:46.445 --> 13:48.805
You can't keep me locked down here forever.

13:48.840 --> 13:49.815
Why?

13:50.954 --> 13:53.760
No one heard our screams when we were a child.

13:53.807 --> 13:55.754
No one will hear yours now.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.994
Just like in that Dumas story.

13:59.041 --> 14:01.672
It was always one of our favorites, wasn't it?

14:01.730 --> 14:05.198
King Louis XIV imprisons his twin brother in the bastille,

14:05.233 --> 14:08.380
forcing him to live out his final days

14:09.155 --> 14:11.480
behind an iron mask.

14:12.748 --> 14:13.488
No.

14:15.061 --> 14:18.595
See, most people think Louis did it
to hide his brother's true identity, but...

14:18.631 --> 14:20.028
We know better.

14:21.801 --> 14:27.322
He did it because he couldn't stand looking
at such a pale reflection of his own greatness.

14:27.371 --> 14:28.603
Don't...

14:30.705 --> 14:32.191
No! No!

14:41.189 --> 14:42.750
Shh, shh, shh.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.174
It's good to be the king.

14:57.051 --> 15:00.538
I guess it's up to me
to show the world the real Lex Luthor.

15:16.192 --> 15:17.002
Chloe.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.047
Hey.

15:18.282 --> 15:20.783
It's about time...
Pretty slow for the quarterback.

15:20.818 --> 15:23.777
Ex-quarterback. What's so important?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.256
Dr. Sinclair.

15:25.362 --> 15:27.990
Did he say something about the explosion at Luthorcorp?

15:28.213 --> 15:29.399
He couldn't.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.489
He's dead, Clark.

15:31.641 --> 15:33.483
What? What happened?

15:33.518 --> 15:34.763
Cardiac arrest.

15:34.798 --> 15:37.827
In a guy with no history of heart problems.

15:38.860 --> 15:40.340
Well, I'd better go tell Lex.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.956
He already knows, I think.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.971
I bumped into him coming out
of Dr. Sinclair's room just before he died.

15:47.136 --> 15:48.192
When was this?

15:48.862 --> 15:50.640
Right after you left for the lab.

15:51.286 --> 15:53.740
Wha... Chloe, I was with Lex.

15:53.892 --> 15:56.111
We went to the lab together.

15:56.816 --> 16:01.098
Which would be about the same time
I was talking to Lex outside Dr. Sinclair's room.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.425
Well, that's impossible.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.994
Not in Smallville.
You of all people should know that.

16:07.556 --> 16:08.542
You know...

16:09.047 --> 16:11.597
Because of all the weird stuff you've seen.

16:13.147 --> 16:15.131
Well, there must be a way to figure out the timeline.

16:15.176 --> 16:18.146
Yeah, there is. Smallville medical center
has a surveillance system

16:18.182 --> 16:22.690
which, as far as you know, I've never hacked into
because that would be wrong.

16:23.301 --> 16:24.989
It's just gonna take a while.

16:25.189 --> 16:26.774
Call me if you find anything.

16:39.809 --> 16:40.678
Lex.

16:42.287 --> 16:44.246
What are you doing here?

16:45.619 --> 16:48.801
I got a message on my cell that you wanted to see me.

16:49.306 --> 16:52.124
So you just let yourself in?

16:52.336 --> 16:53.519
My bad.

16:54.106 --> 16:55.938
Would you like me to go?

16:56.513 --> 17:00.881
No, no, uh, it's okay.
You kinda just surprised me.

17:01.445 --> 17:03.991
I've been doing that to a lot of people.

17:07.184 --> 17:09.532
So what can I do for miss Lang this afternoon?

17:09.556 --> 17:11.608
I wanted to talk to you about Jason.

17:12.924 --> 17:13.757
Oh.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.377
Him.

17:17.021 --> 17:22.532
I, uh, I really appreciate everything that
you've already told me about Jason and his mom,

17:22.556 --> 17:23.507
um,

17:23.578 --> 17:25.480
but do you really think...

17:25.515 --> 17:27.159
What I think, Lana,

17:28.181 --> 17:30.177
is you deserve better.

17:32.964 --> 17:36.228
You deserve to be with someone who

17:36.533 --> 17:40.525
recognizes how extraordinary you are.

17:48.811 --> 17:50.784
Lex, what are you doing?

17:52.463 --> 17:54.585
What I've always wanted to.

18:00.668 --> 18:02.875
Well, I do like them feisty.

18:03.063 --> 18:05.364
Get out of my apartment.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.429
If that's how you want to play it.

18:09.791 --> 18:12.550
Oh, by the way, I'm closing the Talon.

18:12.873 --> 18:13.789
What?

18:14.141 --> 18:15.891
You can't do that.

18:16.877 --> 18:19.742
Hmm... I think I can.

18:20.212 --> 18:23.171
Lex, this is my home. Where am I supposed to go?

18:23.207 --> 18:25.121
That's really up to you, isn't it?

18:26.001 --> 18:29.248
Lana, you could live like a queen by my side,

18:29.306 --> 18:32.459
or get tossed out with the rest of the garbage.

18:33.540 --> 18:35.161
Why don't you think about it?

18:41.583 --> 18:43.274
I know I will.

19:04.398 --> 19:05.103
Lex,

19:05.666 --> 19:07.874
what's going on? What the hell are you doing?

19:07.897 --> 19:09.905
Seizing the moment, dad.

19:12.547 --> 19:14.131
Just like you taught me.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.442
Same time tomorrow?

19:27.247 --> 19:30.124
Now, what's your problem with me this time, old man?

19:30.159 --> 19:33.759
It was your offer to hold the fundraiser
at Luthorcorp plaza,

19:33.813 --> 19:37.421
then you go behind my back and cancel the whole thing.
Why would you do that?

19:37.473 --> 19:42.785
"Because helping those who refuse to help themselves
is a waste of time and money, son!"

19:43.395 --> 19:46.284
Isn't that what the old Lionel Luthor used to say?

19:46.331 --> 19:49.419
I've changed. People change. Lex...

19:49.548 --> 19:53.161
No, they don't.
They just get soft... Like you.

19:53.570 --> 19:55.143
All right, dad,

19:55.495 --> 19:58.924
I'll let you have your little blue plate charity soiree.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.943
I'll even make a generous contribution.

20:00.979 --> 20:04.326
And what would I have to do in exchange
for this contribution, hmm?

20:10.713 --> 20:11.324
Ah...

20:16.622 --> 20:19.241
I want you to prove you're still worthy
to be my father.

20:19.264 --> 20:20.838
Are you insane? Lex...

20:20.861 --> 20:23.363
No. Just curious.

20:23.398 --> 20:25.136
I'm not going to fight you!

20:25.770 --> 20:28.388
Lex! Stop it! Lex! Stop it!

20:30.713 --> 20:34.385
Is your miraculous transformation
into the man in the white suit genuine,

20:34.432 --> 20:35.888
or is it all just an act?

20:35.924 --> 20:39.399
Lex, stop this! Stop it now! Lex, stop it!

20:40.808 --> 20:44.269
Do you even know the answer to that question,
or have you been too afraid to ask?

20:44.305 --> 20:48.379
What's inside you, dad? Is it really just puppies
and hugs now, or is there something else

20:48.414 --> 20:51.746
twisting in your gut, squirming to be free again?

21:01.183 --> 21:03.787
I knew you were in there somewhere, father.

21:18.275 --> 21:20.307
You should've stayed in prison.

21:21.903 --> 21:23.955
You were safer there.

21:52.453 --> 21:53.322
Lana?

21:57.255 --> 21:58.312
Are you okay?

21:58.981 --> 21:59.756
Yeah.

22:03.869 --> 22:04.761
No.

22:05.313 --> 22:06.194
Uh,

22:07.603 --> 22:10.773
did you know that Lex is going to close the Talon?

22:11.125 --> 22:12.053
No.

22:13.309 --> 22:14.639
Who told you that?

22:14.674 --> 22:15.895
He did.

22:16.212 --> 22:18.443
Well, I saw him last night. He didn't mention anything.

22:18.478 --> 22:22.327
Clark, when I, um, when I came home,
he was in my apartment.

22:22.961 --> 22:24.194
The way he was acting... It was...

22:24.757 --> 22:26.930
It was like he was a totally different person.

22:27.622 --> 22:29.064
Maybe he was.

22:30.355 --> 22:33.526
Do you think that maybe he's having another psychotic break?

22:35.158 --> 22:37.330
It's more complicated than that.

22:39.479 --> 22:41.182
It always is, isn't it?

22:42.474 --> 22:44.470
You think you know someone,

22:44.505 --> 22:47.311
but there's this side of them that you never see...

22:49.100 --> 22:50.673
Until it's too late.

22:57.683 --> 23:00.123
Well, you've certainly seen me at my worst.

23:01.097 --> 23:02.812
And at your best.

23:06.038 --> 23:06.933
Lana...

23:11.803 --> 23:12.684
Hello.

23:12.731 --> 23:13.612
Clark,

23:13.864 --> 23:16.527
I found surveillance footage of Lex and me

23:16.562 --> 23:19.239
outside of Dr. Sinclair's room talking.

23:19.521 --> 23:20.754
And

23:21.740 --> 23:24.347
of you and Lex leaving the med center.

23:24.535 --> 23:26.049
What about the time stamps?

23:29.266 --> 23:30.640
They're identical.

23:32.049 --> 23:35.783
Looks like our favorite billionaire
has one hell of a split personality.

23:36.069 --> 23:36.973
Yeah.

23:37.784 --> 23:38.829
Thanks.

23:50.234 --> 23:51.103
Lex.

23:53.075 --> 23:54.261
I need to talk to you.

23:55.823 --> 23:57.361
This is important.

23:59.542 --> 24:02.101
Well, I always have time for a friend, Clark.

24:02.442 --> 24:03.827
What's on your mind?

24:05.565 --> 24:07.174
What did we talk about last night?

24:08.592 --> 24:10.863
We talked about a lot of things...

24:11.180 --> 24:12.449
The future...

24:14.316 --> 24:16.214
Changing the world...

24:16.261 --> 24:18.844
Reshaping it into a better place.

24:20.769 --> 24:22.883
And then you started to feel sick.

24:23.799 --> 24:25.243
You said it was from the apple.

24:26.773 --> 24:27.935
That's right.

24:29.861 --> 24:31.868
Clark, what's this all about?

24:32.714 --> 24:35.027
Well, I had to be sure who I was talking to.

24:36.996 --> 24:37.865
What?

24:39.238 --> 24:42.996
Lex, Dr. Sinclair is dead.
Someone murdered him.

24:46.624 --> 24:49.011
Clark, who would do something like that?

24:49.187 --> 24:50.396
Well, you would.

24:52.134 --> 24:53.285
Well, I mean...

24:54.612 --> 24:56.504
At least someone who looks like you.

25:03.162 --> 25:04.700
Where did you get these?

25:05.037 --> 25:08.571
Chloe pulled them off the surveillance system
at the medical center.

25:08.617 --> 25:10.738
She saw you leaving Sinclair's room

25:10.801 --> 25:12.994
at the same time we were going to Luthorcorp.

25:13.039 --> 25:14.942
How is this possible?

25:15.531 --> 25:19.066
Something must've happened
when the meteor rock exploded during your experiment.

25:19.119 --> 25:20.551
What are you saying...

25:20.624 --> 25:23.361
This other Lex is some kind of copy?

25:23.433 --> 25:25.989
I think he's a part of you that split off.

25:27.204 --> 25:30.789
I'm gonna put a security team together.
Get Chloe, and meet me at the lab.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.584
How will I know it's you?

25:35.140 --> 25:38.109
Well, we can always try a secret handshake.

25:38.326 --> 25:41.825
But I like to think you know me better than anyone
after all those years.

25:42.641 --> 25:45.106
Clark, this whole mess is my fault.

25:45.269 --> 25:47.462
But I'll put an end to all of it tonight.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.858
I want to thank you two for bringing this to my attention.

25:53.894 --> 25:56.349
My security team is working to contain the situation.

25:56.377 --> 25:57.869
Is there anything we can do to help?

25:57.897 --> 25:58.633
Excuse me.

25:59.455 --> 26:00.304
Hello.

26:01.786 --> 26:03.127
I'll be right there.

26:03.986 --> 26:05.817
This could be what I was hoping for.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.935
I'll be right back. Don't worry.
This will all be over soon.

26:10.181 --> 26:12.626
Keep an eye out for the security guard.

26:16.145 --> 26:17.343
Chloe, what are you doing?

26:17.579 --> 26:19.514
Snooping where I don't belong.

26:19.555 --> 26:21.308
I'm thinking of making a career out of it.

26:21.339 --> 26:23.170
Lex said he was gonna be right back.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.011
How can you be sure it was really him?

26:26.087 --> 26:28.841
I was careful. Besides, I think I know my own friend, Chloe.

26:28.870 --> 26:33.769
Clark, how many times has your friend
done something underhanded that you didn't expect?

26:34.118 --> 26:37.723
People have a lot of different sides,
and sometimes, they keep those sides hidden,

26:37.751 --> 26:39.516
even from the ones that they love.

26:41.489 --> 26:44.179
Sometimes you have to, even if that's not what you want.

26:44.208 --> 26:48.279
Yeah, but sooner or later, you have to trust someone
with what's in your heart.

26:48.317 --> 26:51.111
Otherwise, you're gonna end up going through life alone.

27:11.945 --> 27:12.643
Clark.

27:13.531 --> 27:14.409
Clark.

27:15.365 --> 27:16.677
What'd you find?

27:33.555 --> 27:35.360
Situation contained.

27:53.712 --> 27:54.609
Chloe.

27:55.116 --> 27:56.096
Chloe?

28:10.637 --> 28:12.714
We really should get you to the hospital.

28:12.761 --> 28:15.954
Yeah, because that worked out really well for Dr. Sinclair.

28:15.990 --> 28:18.810
Clark, I'm fine, okay?
Although,

28:19.058 --> 28:22.810
I still can't figure out how I survived
the sky falling on my head,

28:22.845 --> 28:23.825
can you?

28:25.583 --> 28:30.126
Well, the last thing I remember is I grabbed you
and we dove underneath the lab table.

28:31.353 --> 28:33.607
It must've protected us from the debris.

28:35.188 --> 28:37.934
Good thing our ex-quarterback moves so fast.

28:38.689 --> 28:40.636
Yeah, well, not fast enough.

28:42.229 --> 28:43.091
Clark,

28:43.704 --> 28:47.492
I can live with a couple of bruises,
considering the alternative.

28:49.365 --> 28:51.831
You're always there when I need you, Clark.

28:53.117 --> 28:55.878
I just hope, someday, I can do the same for you.

28:56.979 --> 28:59.268
Right now I just want to make sure you're safe.

29:01.050 --> 29:04.447
I can... I can stay with Lois at the military base.

29:04.482 --> 29:06.547
Perfect. Although,

29:06.583 --> 29:09.178
getting between her and the general
while they're trying to reconcile

29:09.218 --> 29:11.295
might be just as dangerous.

29:11.814 --> 29:13.348
Watch out, okay?

29:13.501 --> 29:17.212
Lex can be devious enough.
There's no telling what his evil twin is capable of.

29:17.247 --> 29:18.368
I'll be on my cell.

29:24.138 --> 29:26.273
Okay. But if you see him, call me.

29:26.312 --> 29:27.516
And be careful.

29:28.035 --> 29:29.781
Lex really isn't himself.

29:29.817 --> 29:32.731
He's more dangerous than we thought.
Thanks, Lana.

29:33.156 --> 29:35.272
Is that what you think of me, Clark?

29:35.755 --> 29:36.971
I'm hurt.

29:37.466 --> 29:39.012
I thought we were friends.

29:41.230 --> 29:42.449
Where's Lex?

29:46.095 --> 29:47.947
He's standing right in front of you.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.399
No, you're not him.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.604
The real Lex would never try to kill me or Chloe.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.952
Well, you're probably right.

29:54.988 --> 29:56.852
But he's thought about it.

29:58.374 --> 30:02.742
All the times you've meddled in his plans...
derailed his ambitions.

30:02.790 --> 30:06.365
He's thought about killing all of you,
just never had the guts to go through with it.

30:06.671 --> 30:07.827
What are you?

30:08.724 --> 30:11.521
I was just about to ask you the same question.

30:14.459 --> 30:17.963
I dropped half the lab on you and miss Sullivan, and yet,

30:18.423 --> 30:19.906
here you stand.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.707
I was lucky.

30:22.910 --> 30:26.497
Don't be modest, Clark.
We both know you're much more than that.

30:28.763 --> 30:30.878
It all makes sense now.

30:31.173 --> 30:34.099
That first day on the bridge when we met...

30:34.146 --> 30:37.592
How you were able to save me when my car went into the river.

30:37.981 --> 30:40.698
All of the other miraculous times you appeared

30:40.746 --> 30:43.672
in just the right place at just the right moment...

30:43.979 --> 30:48.632
Almost as if you possessed powers and abilities
beyond those of mortal men.

30:51.062 --> 30:53.457
You've lied to me for years, Clark.

30:56.049 --> 30:58.149
But now I know your secret.

30:59.801 --> 31:01.288
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:01.323 --> 31:02.306
Don't!

31:03.604 --> 31:06.235
I saw you after the explosion.

31:06.294 --> 31:09.893
You lifted a half a ton of concrete
like it was nothing.

31:11.757 --> 31:14.644
I should've figured it out a long time ago.

31:15.069 --> 31:17.606
All the pieces were there. I was just...

31:17.971 --> 31:19.930
Blinded by friendship.

31:20.072 --> 31:22.896
A factor that's been removed from the equation.

31:23.733 --> 31:25.421
Whatever you are,

31:26.329 --> 31:28.418
whatever you're planning, I'm gonna stop you.

31:28.548 --> 31:30.345
No, you aren't.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.024
You're gonna join me.

31:33.059 --> 31:33.873
What?

31:34.026 --> 31:35.596
Think about it, Clark.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.920
My intellect, your powers.

31:37.956 --> 31:40.272
Together, we could rule this world.

31:40.520 --> 31:43.269
We'll walk as gods among men.

31:43.753 --> 31:46.278
You're not a god. I'm not even sure you're human.

31:47.104 --> 31:48.009
Are you?

31:50.711 --> 31:52.375
Is the real Lex still alive?

31:52.410 --> 31:54.912
Oh... You don't get it, do you?

31:54.959 --> 31:56.870
I am the real Lex!

31:56.906 --> 31:58.487
Is he still alive?

31:58.851 --> 31:59.961
Sort of.

32:02.332 --> 32:06.427
I mean, I couldn't really be sure what
would happen to me if I killed him, so...

32:06.462 --> 32:08.810
I tucked him away where I can keep an eye on him.

32:08.963 --> 32:11.787
Maybe torture him a little when I'm feeling blue.

32:13.462 --> 32:14.607
Where is he?

32:14.937 --> 32:16.093
Where is he?

32:20.195 --> 32:21.870
What's the matter, Clark?

32:23.227 --> 32:24.926
You look a little sick.

32:26.277 --> 32:29.522
Just like in the lab when you were with the other me...

32:30.124 --> 32:33.062
When he opened the safe door
and exposed you to the...

32:33.711 --> 32:35.033
Meteor rock.

32:44.674 --> 32:47.388
Every man has a weakness, Clark...

32:48.236 --> 32:50.808
no matter how superhuman he may be.

32:51.257 --> 32:53.133
I've embraced my destiny.

32:54.077 --> 32:56.071
Now embrace yours.

32:56.295 --> 32:58.856
We could forge a new future together.

32:59.375 --> 33:00.767
I'll never join you.

33:00.829 --> 33:02.458
Yes, you will.

33:02.694 --> 33:05.667
Or everyone you love will suffer!

33:17.488 --> 33:18.409
Clark!

33:18.597 --> 33:19.530
Mom!

33:19.730 --> 33:20.701
Son!

33:22.436 --> 33:23.309
Dad!

33:23.344 --> 33:24.559
My god, Clark!

33:26.436 --> 33:27.675
You're bleeding!

33:28.324 --> 33:30.959
I'm guessing that doesn't happen very often.

33:31.006 --> 33:32.080
Lex...

33:33.543 --> 33:34.912
What did you do?

33:37.389 --> 33:39.086
I gotta hand it to you guys.

33:39.134 --> 33:41.670
I mean, keeping something like this a secret

33:41.836 --> 33:45.470
must've required an impressive ability to obscure the truth.

33:46.355 --> 33:49.521
Maybe the Kents and Luthors
have something in common after all.

33:53.450 --> 33:54.371
Yeah...

33:55.020 --> 33:57.368
I know about the green meteor rock

33:57.557 --> 33:59.663
and Clark's unique gifts.

33:59.710 --> 34:00.855
What do you want?

34:00.890 --> 34:02.895
The world, Mrs. Kent.

34:02.967 --> 34:05.327
And your son is gonna help me bring it to its knees.

34:05.361 --> 34:08.772
Now talk some sense into him
before something unfortunate happens!

34:10.967 --> 34:11.994
Like that.

34:12.159 --> 34:13.268
Dad?

34:22.172 --> 34:24.708
You were right about me all along, Mr. Kent.

34:27.610 --> 34:30.010
I am the villain of this story.

34:39.085 --> 34:40.536
Two Lexes?

34:41.127 --> 34:43.204
How the hell did that happen?

34:43.757 --> 34:47.440
There was an accident at Luthorcorp,
and I think that Lex was affected...

34:48.489 --> 34:50.235
By black kryptonite.

34:50.815 --> 34:53.116
How did Lex get a hold of black kryptonite?

34:53.152 --> 34:56.690
Well, I don't he knows anythingabout the black K.
I think he accidentally created it

34:56.726 --> 34:58.922
when he was experimenting with the meteor rocks.

34:59.724 --> 35:02.061
But that's how I can put the two Lexes back together.

35:02.096 --> 35:02.934
How?

35:03.831 --> 35:06.663
The duplicate Lex in the barn...
He said he was keeping the real Lex alive...

35:06.698 --> 35:09.530
Somewhere close to keep him safe...
And if I can find him...

35:09.695 --> 35:10.678
Clark!

35:30.162 --> 35:31.023
Lex.

35:45.814 --> 35:46.687
Clark...

35:46.723 --> 35:47.844
Don't try to talk.

35:47.879 --> 35:48.622
Get out.

35:48.658 --> 35:50.546
No, you're gonna be okay, all right?

35:51.796 --> 35:52.776
Get out.

35:58.526 --> 36:00.721
The hero comes to the rescue.

36:01.146 --> 36:03.010
How predictable is that?

36:03.836 --> 36:05.480
Leave him alone.

36:06.105 --> 36:08.866
I'm really starting to hate the sound of my own voice.

36:11.332 --> 36:14.970
I offer you a chance at greatness,
and this is what you do with it?

36:17.082 --> 36:18.722
I want you to remember this day, Clark.

36:19.197 --> 36:21.737
I want you to remember that, despite all your amazing powers,

36:21.792 --> 36:23.782
there was one man that beat you.

36:35.501 --> 36:37.672
Maybe this was always our destiny.

36:38.251 --> 36:39.371
How sad.

36:41.313 --> 36:43.945
Let's see what happens to me if you die!

36:48.015 --> 36:49.738
You can't kill me!

36:50.800 --> 36:52.199
I drive you!

36:53.119 --> 36:54.795
I give your life meaning!

36:55.786 --> 36:59.102
I'm your soul, you weak, pathetic, little man!

36:59.149 --> 37:01.430
I'm the real Lex Luthor!

37:26.315 --> 37:27.212
Lex!

37:30.737 --> 37:31.610
Lex.

37:36.150 --> 37:37.813
It's all right. It's over now.

37:56.843 --> 37:59.024
It's not much to look at, is it?

38:00.912 --> 38:03.178
Broken dreams seldom are.

38:05.620 --> 38:06.493
Clark...

38:08.290 --> 38:10.851
I want to say thank you for saving me, but...

38:11.960 --> 38:13.930
Words seemed too small.

38:15.016 --> 38:17.086
Without you, I would've been lost.

38:17.959 --> 38:19.469
You're a true friend.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.974
It's too bad your other half didn't think so.

38:23.894 --> 38:25.868
I'm sorry for what I...

38:26.364 --> 38:27.933
He put you through.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.992
How much of it do you remember?

38:32.712 --> 38:34.210
Nothing, really.

38:34.803 --> 38:37.564
Once we divided, we were two different people.

38:38.390 --> 38:41.103
Well, you might want to go talk to Lana
when you get a chance.

38:42.075 --> 38:43.664
He didn't hurt her, did he?

38:43.703 --> 38:45.709
Well, I'm not sure what happened, but...

38:46.181 --> 38:47.880
She seemed pretty upset.

38:50.564 --> 38:53.319
Don't be too hard on yourself. It really wasn't you.

38:54.649 --> 38:57.670
That's what I've been standing here,
trying to figure out.

38:59.243 --> 39:02.476
Did the accident create an evil Lex...

39:04.246 --> 39:06.441
Or is that what's really inside of me?

39:14.799 --> 39:15.555
Hi.

39:17.466 --> 39:18.225
Hey.

39:24.490 --> 39:28.031
As far as awkward moments go, this is definitely memorable.

39:34.296 --> 39:36.479
Chloe filled me in on what happened.

39:40.636 --> 39:43.610
I wish I could remember exactly what my other half did

39:43.657 --> 39:45.922
so I could apologize properly.

39:47.492 --> 39:50.941
I just hope it wasn't anything we can't get past.

39:51.802 --> 39:55.307
Well, as long as you're not closing the Talon
and kicking me out...

39:56.852 --> 39:58.032
I said that?

40:00.451 --> 40:03.696
Along with expressing certain...

40:04.050 --> 40:05.242
desires.

40:07.779 --> 40:09.834
Lana, I'm sorry.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.185
- It wasn't me.
- Are you sure?

40:16.335 --> 40:18.565
Look, whatever my feelings are,

40:19.720 --> 40:22.894
I'd never do anything to jeopardize our friendship.

40:26.162 --> 40:27.071
I know.

40:41.724 --> 40:43.506
I really am sorry.

40:56.690 --> 40:57.882
So am I.

41:05.239 --> 41:07.446
Planning your next assault, son?

41:07.835 --> 41:08.697
Dad...

41:09.015 --> 41:10.089
Your cheek.

41:10.207 --> 41:10.969
Well,

41:11.264 --> 41:14.249
it's a wake-up call,
and I'm grateful for that.

41:14.969 --> 41:15.901
Look,

41:16.526 --> 41:18.981
whatever I've done in the last few days...

41:19.020 --> 41:22.548
Please, no need for an apology.
Quite the contrary.

41:29.694 --> 41:33.646
I must say, you finally proved yourself
to be the son I've always wanted.

41:33.918 --> 41:38.685
And I thank you for showing me so clearly
the error of my ways.

41:40.887 --> 41:42.787
What are you talking about?

41:47.377 --> 41:50.185
I'm closing down the foundation immediately.

41:50.999 --> 41:51.795
What?

41:53.648 --> 41:56.043
You can't. The charity is your life.

41:56.079 --> 41:59.264
Ha, ha, ha... Just a foolish dream.

41:59.312 --> 42:00.790
I'm awake now.

42:05.628 --> 42:09.174
A man can't deny his true nature, can he, Lex?

42:13.351 --> 42:14.507
No...

42:15.073 --> 42:16.501
We're Luthors.

42:23.951 --> 42:25.437
We're Luthors.
