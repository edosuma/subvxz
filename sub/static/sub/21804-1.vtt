00:43.144 --> 00:49.883
I want them to feel as if
they're really going to die.

00:50.985 --> 00:51.986
I want that.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.091
Yeah, yeah.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.994
I want to hear the screams of terror.

01:00.028 --> 01:01.929
That's what they pay for.

01:01.962 --> 01:02.796
Yes.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.442
I got him, Mr. Kane.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.978
Why so formal?

01:22.783 --> 01:26.120
Young Travis, what did we discuss?

01:26.154 --> 01:27.221
Um, Father.

01:29.223 --> 01:32.493
Much better my boy, much better, now,

01:36.697 --> 01:38.799
what did you bring me?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.401
The gas cans that you asked.

01:40.434 --> 01:44.038
That I asked to be
delivered to the vans.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.078
Put them there for now.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.849
I'm sorry, Father.

02:00.088 --> 02:02.256
It's all right, come here.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.594
You look like you lost something.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.297
Come here, what's that?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.338
Look at that.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.708
That's yours to keep.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.344
Thank you.

02:27.181 --> 02:30.351
Would you like to double your money.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.122
No loss, all gain.

02:36.924 --> 02:41.095
All right, give me the coin,
give me your hand,

02:41.129 --> 02:43.131
right hand, there we are.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.432
Open it.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.380
Open.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.520
But?

03:06.554 --> 03:09.157
But you're empty handed.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.023
Yes.

03:11.425 --> 03:15.429
And what lesson have you just learned.

03:15.463 --> 03:20.334
You have just learned that
nothing in this life is free.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.804
And if something seems
too good to be true,

03:23.837 --> 03:25.105
it probably is.

03:26.274 --> 03:30.144
The key, young Travis,
is knowing where to look.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.984
I want to know.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.919
You want to know what?

03:38.952 --> 03:44.625
Fireballs, how you do fireballs,
the coin too, all of that, teach me.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.961
The art of misdirection
is the power to direct

03:47.995 --> 03:53.033
the audiences attention
in one direction.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.070
While making them
distracted from the other.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.340
Can I try?

04:00.140 --> 04:03.143
Yes, watch the fire.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.281
The flame will tell
you when you release.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.115
Ow.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.853
Endure the pain to learn true magic,

04:12.886 --> 04:15.689
you must endure the pain.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.024
Do you remember my benediction?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.459
Magic, sacrifice.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.563
I want to try again.

04:24.365 --> 04:28.436
All right, go get my kit in
the back of the tent. Hurry.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.313
Miss.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.250
Miss.

06:25.252 --> 06:29.857
I know you've been through a lot
but we need to get your statement.

06:29.890 --> 06:30.724
Why?

06:32.426 --> 06:36.697
We just have some questions,
a few things we need to clear up.

06:39.166 --> 06:43.103
Fine, it all started with the invites,

06:43.136 --> 06:46.974
the golden tickets filled
with false promises.

06:58.419 --> 07:02.890
I'm gonna make you an
offer you can't refuse.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.459
1300 bucks cash, take it or leave it.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.327
I mean come on, man, these are Grable.

07:07.361 --> 07:10.498
She was box office gold
like 12 years running.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.401
Right, that's why I just
offered you 1300 bucks cash

07:13.434 --> 07:17.371
take it or leave it, instead of kissing you
on the mouth and feeding you to the fishes.

07:17.405 --> 07:20.441
Let me just explain something
to you about business.

07:20.474 --> 07:25.278
Grable was a huge star, when?
30's and 40's.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.382
Which means all of her
fans are what, dead.

07:28.416 --> 07:32.152
Which means I'm gonna be holding
onto these until I'm dead,

07:32.185 --> 07:36.490
so it's $1300, take it or leave it.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.693
I mean these were my grandma's dude.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.565
Why don't you give them back to her?

07:44.598 --> 07:46.600
Special delivery.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.470
Is that you Mr. McFeely?

07:49.503 --> 07:51.138
How's your ticker?

07:51.171 --> 07:54.174
If I had a heart it would be fine.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.209
That's junk.

07:56.744 --> 08:02.349
Has anybody ever told you, you bare a
remarkable resemblance to Sammy Davis, Jr.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.385
I'll talk to you later freak.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.855
I'm not a freak, I'm Batman.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.527
Nice.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.635
All right dude, 1300 bucks.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.371
Are you still here?

08:24.404 --> 08:26.607
Yeah I'm still here, give me the money.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.642
All right, all right, all right.

08:28.676 --> 08:34.147
But I feel inflation has brought that
number down to a thousand dollars.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.518
You can't be serious, dude.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.655
I mean 20 seconds ago you
said it was 1300 bucks.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.690
Tick tock.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.464
All right man, give me the money.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.602
You drive a hard bargain.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.141
You're a monster.

09:01.174 --> 09:05.212
I'm a capitalist,
just ahead of the curve.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.280
You're a dick.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.348
I'm Batman.

09:11.685 --> 09:16.189
Greetings and salutations
my lucky victims.

09:16.223 --> 09:22.763
You have been invited to attend a resurrection
and rebirth of the greatest show on Earth.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.835
Let's get this party started,
my little guinea pigs.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.908
Let the games begin!

09:35.509 --> 09:36.343
Yes!

09:41.849 --> 09:42.816
Roxy.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.351
Hey man, how's it going?

09:44.384 --> 09:47.755
Very well thanks, I haven't had to
eject any delinquents into orbit.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.422
It's fucking loud in here.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.490
It's a little hectic.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.092
How's your brother?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.294
He's all right, he's
at home with a sitter.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.463
Oh yeah, I understand. / Yeah.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.931
Well enjoy yourself.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.466
All right, catch you later.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.115
It's the third time this
week you haven't made dinner

10:49.116 --> 10:50.717
just so you could go hang
out with your friends!

10:50.718 --> 10:52.219
It's same fucking thing every time.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.786
I don't understand, are
they more important than me?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.087
No they're not more important than you.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.322
Of course they're not
more important than me.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.590
I've been here fucking
every day this week.

10:57.591 --> 10:58.825
No you're not, you have checked out.

10:58.826 --> 10:59.792
You're looking at your phone right now!

10:59.793 --> 11:01.461
You do not care about me at all.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.598
What are you doing, where
do you think you're going?

11:04.632 --> 11:06.600
Listen to me, Greg?

11:06.634 --> 11:10.738
Okay we're about to be done, if you
don't get off. This has got to be...

11:11.905 --> 11:14.608
You can run, but you can't hide.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.713
Look at you now, son,
now I got to pee on you.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.393
Quarter million dollars, Balthazar Kane.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.765
Somebody's messing with me.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.534
Quarter million dollars,
oh I can do this.

11:41.568 --> 11:47.074
With my boy Balthazar Kane,
yes sir, yes sir, I'm in.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.477
We didn't know the evil we
were getting ourselves into.

12:24.511 --> 12:28.515
We just thought for once
we were the lucky ones.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.161
Hey, I'm Scott.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.429
Roxy.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.132
Oh are we doing introductions?

12:46.700 --> 12:49.837
I'm Eddy England, from
Big Ed's Hoarder Heaven

12:49.870 --> 12:56.009
but you little kiddies and you too, can
call me Ed, or Eddie, or Stallion.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.345
I'm sure you've heard
of my place, right?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.180
Collector's Paradise on Third and Main.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.182
I know that place, it's sick.

13:02.215 --> 13:06.987
Dude, next time you come in
you're getting a 3% discount

13:07.020 --> 13:10.523
on a purchase of a hundred dollars or more.
That goes for any of you.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.393
Carrie, it's a pleasure.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.594
Jake.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.595
Hey I'm Greg.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.097
Hi guys, I'm Tracy.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.499
I'm sorry, I just want to
know if anybody's interested,

13:19.532 --> 13:23.036
I just got in a mint collection
of vintage photographs

13:23.070 --> 13:26.373
of Grable from the 30's and 40's.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.374
Who?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.241
Grable.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.279
She's an actress from the 30's and 40's.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.281
She was the dancer.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.049
I'm a young person dude, so...

13:36.083 --> 13:41.922
Anyway, hi, I'm Tracy, I take it we all
got that creepy golden ticket invitation.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.156
Yep.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.192
So are we all secretly related?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.394
Never say never, why do you ask?

13:47.427 --> 13:50.297
Just wondering how we all
won the lotto, sweetheart.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.410
Fuck, I am out.

14:06.079 --> 14:10.050
I love it, I love it. /
I love it, I love it. I love it.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.752
Clown! Clown-man!

14:17.024 --> 14:18.458
Chill out, dude.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.398
Love it.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.043
We can't even see out of this thing,

14:36.076 --> 14:38.211
how are we supposed to see where we are?

14:38.245 --> 14:39.880
Quit complaining.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.282
It's creepy but kind of sweet.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.616
That's the adventure.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.385
Yeah, it's all right.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.691
Oh my God, these are original posters.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.693
I got that one right there.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.763
Dude I just met you, I'm sure you
don't have an original poster.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.432
When you have an original poster
you have a different aura.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.068
Don't tell me what I got.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.470
Hey did you guys get a
schedule with your invitation,

15:03.503 --> 15:05.372
because mine just came
with a time and place.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.241
No idea, I know as much as you guys do.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.677
Yeah I'm in the same boat unfortunately.

15:10.710 --> 15:15.815
Good questions one, good questions all.

15:16.683 --> 15:22.856
Welcome, my friends, to the Circus
Kane Afterbirth Party Ball.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.359
You're here as my very,
very special guests.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.396
And I have spared no expense for you.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.099
Only the best.

15:32.132 --> 15:39.139
Like the phoenix rising from the
ashes, this dirty bird arises new.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.043
An adventure of horrors
are built just for you.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.847
Thrill and recoil at my new masterpiece.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.749
You'll all be part of my legacy.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.385
Alive, or deceased.

15:53.086 --> 15:57.624
A reviewer, a blogger, a
collector, a scream queen,

15:57.657 --> 16:02.162
a gamer, a rocker, and
blogger and a teen.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.699
You make up every aspect
of the horror community.

16:06.733 --> 16:12.739
I've selected you all for this
very, very horrible opportunity.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.576
Now spread the word as much as you can.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.778
For your audiences will never hear

16:18.811 --> 16:22.149
from your worthless mouths again!

16:25.485 --> 16:28.721
Hello, piggy, piggy, piggy, let's play.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.760
Classic Kane, it's
classic freakin' Kane!

16:33.793 --> 16:35.462
Wait you've seen this one before?

16:35.495 --> 16:38.598
Oh my God, yes I've seen this before.

16:38.631 --> 16:42.135
This guy is like king of
the traveling horror show.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.606
Oh please don't tell me that none of
you have ever seen his shows before?

16:46.639 --> 16:47.607
Nope.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.608
Nope.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.476
Um, no.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.747
I mean I've heard him
mentioned by a few older

16:54.781 --> 17:00.988
shlock horror directors as inspiration when
I used to act, but never actually myself.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.891
Oh my God, I thought I recognized you.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.160
You're the scream queen.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.396
You were in Night Terrors.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.563
Guilty.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.299
Yeah yeah that is you.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.733
I did a review on that movie.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.569
Movie sucked but you were okay I guess.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.739
No, you were amazing, trust me.

17:19.771 --> 17:24.211
From the bottom of my
heart you were amazing.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.645
Oh I worship you.

17:26.012 --> 17:29.016
So we were all selected
from our fan bases?

17:29.049 --> 17:30.783
That's viral marketing at it's finest.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.119
He just wants us post about him.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.221
Who here doesn't have a
shit ton of followers.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.822
Raise your hands if you don't.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.490
My Instagram's lit as fuck.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.925
See what I mean.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.794
No no, he's right, we were all picked

17:41.828 --> 17:44.064
because we're influential
in the horror community.

17:44.097 --> 17:48.968
He just wants to get everybody
hyped about his return.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.937
I've known about Kane for years.

17:50.970 --> 17:55.975
I even have his old comic book,
Circus Kane's Lurking Terrors.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.677
God, I love that comic book.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.378
Dude tell me you still
have it, is it mint?

17:59.379 --> 18:02.315
No what happened was
I was off doing my thing

18:02.349 --> 18:05.052
and my Momma she went and sold it.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.954
You let your Mom sell your comic book.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.389
Don't talk about my momma.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.258
There was that song about him, right?

18:11.291 --> 18:14.127
That Clown Killers single, Burn in...

18:14.161 --> 18:15.495
Insane, yes that's it.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.698
It was college, helped me study.

18:18.731 --> 18:22.702
Hey wait a minute, what
are you doing here, Einstein?

18:22.735 --> 18:28.208
We all have some sort of reference
to Kane, what's your deal?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.876
Thank you, medium-sized Ed,

18:29.909 --> 18:34.714
actually the reason I'm here is 'cause I'm not
scared as shit so I know I'm gonna win.

18:34.747 --> 18:38.351
Also I need the money
because I owe some people.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.488
Who doesn't need $250,000?

18:41.521 --> 18:46.459
You know what, all I care about
is getting my poster signed.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.561
Once he signs them they're
gonna be worth like,

18:48.595 --> 18:50.730
a hundred times what I paid for them.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.198
Why is that, you plan on killing him?

18:52.199 --> 18:54.000
Dude, I'm not the killer,
Kane's the killer.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.304
Oh shit, he killed somebody? / For real?

18:57.337 --> 18:58.804
Yeah I think I read something about him

18:58.805 --> 19:01.308
having some pretty bad legal problems.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.043
Yeah, if you want to call legal problems

19:04.077 --> 19:06.613
burning a man to death,
then he had legal problems.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.816
Seriously, what are you talking about?

19:13.553 --> 19:14.787
Damn.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.256
That's like the song.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.291
The burning man, that's right.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.725
Yeah you guys know the song, right?

19:26.133 --> 19:28.868
♪ This is the ballad of Balthazar Kane ♪

19:28.901 --> 19:32.004
♪ Who burned to a crisp
now he's gone insane ♪

19:32.038 --> 19:35.508
♪ Killer of love by Valentine's name ♪

19:35.542 --> 19:38.411
♪ Burnt, to a jail to
live out his shame ♪

19:38.445 --> 19:41.914
♪ Born of the madness due to the pain ♪

19:41.948 --> 19:45.185
♪ Back from the dead
to play out his game ♪

19:45.218 --> 19:48.721
♪ Run little children
when you hear his name ♪

19:48.755 --> 19:50.157
♪ 'Cause there's nowhere to hide ♪

19:51.858 --> 19:53.960
♪ From Circus Kane ♪

19:57.397 --> 19:58.531
That was it.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.268
Wow, that was wonderful.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.472
Out now!

20:51.150 --> 20:55.388
So this is it? / Yeah.
How long was I out for?

20:55.422 --> 20:57.457
I don't know, I was asleep too.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.025
I think everyone was.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.627
They gassed us.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.994
They what?

21:02.028 --> 21:03.696
I think they gassed us.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.697
Don't be ridiculous.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.133
Move! Stairs, now! /
I saw the green gas.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.168
Lay off the drugs, punk.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.087
There must be no one around for miles.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.723
I guess it's all just a
part of the experience huh?

21:30.757 --> 21:33.293
Kane couldn't have picked
a more perfect place.

21:33.326 --> 21:36.696
It's huge, this place is rad.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.130
Creepy.

21:38.164 --> 21:42.034
Talking about the house or the way
Big Ed's been looking at you?

21:42.068 --> 21:48.341
This was totally worth being drugged,
or gassed or whatever he did to us.

22:03.590 --> 22:08.595
Welcome one, welcome all, to the
new and improved Circus Kane.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.933
Enter, if you dare.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.635
Sure thing, Lurch.

22:19.372 --> 22:22.509
Into the haunted mansion we go.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.211
I don't like the way this looks.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.245
Let's do this.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.485
All right.

22:34.454 --> 22:37.490
Are you ready?
The circus is about to begin.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.731
This is gonna be the
easiest money I ever made.

22:44.764 --> 22:45.765
What the fuck?

22:49.068 --> 22:50.903
Hey, where did they go?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.353
Good luck.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.730
Look inside to see your fate.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.699
You think it's a two-way mirror?

23:19.732 --> 23:22.502
No, it's too old for that.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.775
That was nothing, guys.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.311
I've seen that gag a hundred times.

23:32.345 --> 23:34.381
Hey, are you okay?

23:34.414 --> 23:35.748
Yeah I'm fine.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.387
Yo, can I have one of those?

23:40.420 --> 23:42.120
You don't want one of these,
this is medicine.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.590
I've got a bad heart.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.792
What, did you do a little
too much blow there, Big Ed?

23:45.825 --> 23:48.861
I just wasn't expecting
a jump scare that's all.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.055
Who comes to a haunted house
not expecting jump scares?

23:51.063 --> 23:53.400
I'm here to face my fears.

24:00.973 --> 24:01.874
Shall we?

24:03.342 --> 24:04.577
Lead the way.

24:26.533 --> 24:29.569
Ooh that was so scary.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.202
They're gonna have to
do way better than that

24:31.203 --> 24:35.241
or we're all going home
with 250 large, cha-ching.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.743
In my bank account.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.411
Hawaii here I come.

24:38.445 --> 24:40.647
I bet you Big Ed doesn't
make it 20 more minutes.

24:40.680 --> 24:47.687
Yo yo yo yo yo, I was just faking my
heart condition to psyche you out, OB.

24:48.354 --> 24:51.123
Yo yo yo don't shit your
pants and die, old man.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.597
I'm hungry, when do we eat?

24:57.630 --> 24:58.465
Figures.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.033
I'm a growing boy.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.068
No you're not.

25:03.402 --> 25:06.372
Now this is getting interesting.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.374
These photos are horrific.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.643
I think you mean "awesome."

25:13.412 --> 25:15.314
It's like they're just meat.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.916
Aren't we all?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.389
This is gonna look great on my site.

25:18.417 --> 25:22.622
Huh, that's interesting,
I have cell service.

25:22.655 --> 25:26.192
It doesn't exactly fit the whole
abandoned haunted house cliché, does it?

25:26.225 --> 25:28.094
I'm telling you man,
it's all for promotion.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.862
You think? / Yeah.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.298
Isn't he full of surprises?

25:34.300 --> 25:40.573
Hello, my marvelous little
martyrs and my little piggies.

25:40.607 --> 25:45.111
Let's get this slaughterhouse
officially started!

25:46.045 --> 25:49.015
But, before we begin,

25:49.048 --> 25:52.151
I would have something
to remember you by

25:52.184 --> 25:57.189
or should I say, to
identify the corpse with.

25:58.925 --> 26:04.931
Now if you'll notice, in the corners of
all the rooms you'll see these red lights.

26:05.464 --> 26:09.936
These, my little piggies,
are cameras that are there

26:09.969 --> 26:15.842
to record every delicious
moment of your demise.

26:15.875 --> 26:20.212
I'll broadcast these
videos to all of your fans

26:20.246 --> 26:25.117
and to all of your followers
after your journey has ended.

26:25.151 --> 26:31.758
So, your descent into madness and
hell can be shared with the world.

26:32.759 --> 26:37.530
I would like you to
share on social media,

26:37.564 --> 26:42.501
to all of your little parasites
for all the world to see...

26:42.535 --> 26:43.770
I told you guys, you see?

26:43.803 --> 26:47.406
Yeah yeah we get it
dude, shut up already.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.441
...The Circus Kane!

26:50.276 --> 26:54.046
And your roles as my disciples
of pleasure and pain.

26:54.080 --> 27:00.119
If you're too weak and you can't
take the heat just ask for mercy

27:01.120 --> 27:08.094
with the words, Balthazar Kane,
you win again!

27:08.127 --> 27:10.963
And you are free to leave...

27:10.997 --> 27:15.501
Big Ed never taps out.

27:15.534 --> 27:19.606
...You go home empty-handed.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.842
But if you make it all the way though,

27:22.875 --> 27:28.681
you go home $250,000 richer!

27:29.148 --> 27:32.151
Now, I doubt that any
of you will make it

27:32.184 --> 27:38.625
all the way through, and I am quite
confident in what I have in store for you.

27:39.626 --> 27:42.995
This mansion has been in
my family for generations,

27:43.029 --> 27:47.533
and it contains the
vengeful dead of centuries.

27:48.500 --> 27:53.439
And all of it is wired from
top to bottom with cameras

27:53.472 --> 27:57.509
so that you'll never,
ever be truly alone.

27:57.543 --> 28:02.348
Now, as you travel through
the lost shadows of my home,

28:02.381 --> 28:08.054
you may bump into my little
friends here and there.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.923
But...

28:10.957 --> 28:14.426
Let courage be your muse.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.529
And explore at your own peril.

28:17.563 --> 28:21.200
And I promise you nothing less than

28:21.233 --> 28:28.240
the most terrifying night of
you're miserable, little lives.

28:28.941 --> 28:35.948
Release your inner monsters inside
and let darkness be your guide.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.422
Brr, zoinks.

28:43.455 --> 28:47.593
Thelma, I think it's
time we looked for clues.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.862
Do we get a Scooby snack if we find one?

28:49.896 --> 28:52.264
Rooby roo!

28:52.298 --> 28:53.866
Stupid.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.235
Hey! That door just opened.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.044
Looks like a magic room.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.079
Any fool can see that.

29:09.515 --> 29:13.219
Come on, guys.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.653
What just happened?

29:14.687 --> 29:16.255
Let me try.
What the fuck?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.090
Hey, open the door.

29:18.124 --> 29:18.958
It's locked.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.226
Come on guys, open the door.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.028
We have to get in there.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.998
Oh shit, no no no, open the door!
Come on, guys!

29:26.032 --> 29:27.934
Open the fucking door! /
I'm sure he's fine.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.334
Do something.
He doesn't sound okay.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.703
Open the fucking door!

29:30.737 --> 29:32.471
Open the fucking door!

29:32.504 --> 29:35.074
No no!

29:35.107 --> 29:35.942
Let me.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.882
There you go, you loosened it up for me.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.300
Oh Jesus.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.481
What's going on?

30:26.692 --> 30:29.161
Oh this is a gag, guys.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.897
This is Kane.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.508
See, it's nothing.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.385
He doesn't think it's funny.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.750
Where'd he go?

31:24.783 --> 31:27.753
He's good. / Guys,
I think we should help him.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.235
Oh shit. / No, that's a real chainsaw.

31:56.582 --> 32:00.152
He's actually killing him, he's actually
killing him! / That's real!

32:04.991 --> 32:07.826
No, Jake, Jake!

32:20.172 --> 32:21.707
All right, we have to get out of here.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.442
Chill. / This is not good.

32:23.475 --> 32:24.543
I'm calling the police.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.413
No no, don't be ridiculous.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.082
That clown just murdered Jake,
I'm not going to be next.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.651
Put the phone down.

32:32.684 --> 32:36.122
Look, we just met this dude, guys.

32:36.155 --> 32:39.758
I mean seriously, all Jake would talk
about was posting on social media.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.595
This is scaring people 101, right?

32:43.629 --> 32:47.333
Always have a plant.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.569
Sure, this guy they let him cozy
up to us a little bit, right?

32:50.602 --> 32:53.839
And then the next thing you know,

32:53.872 --> 32:56.275
he's over there, they've
obscured his view from us

32:56.308 --> 32:58.744
a little while while
they set up the gag.

32:58.777 --> 33:02.081
I hate to agree with
anybody in this room,

33:02.114 --> 33:05.084
but dude, you are absolutely right.

33:05.117 --> 33:08.720
No dude, listen, I used to see
Kane's shows back in the 80's,

33:08.754 --> 33:11.690
and I saw this one
where he'd take a random

33:11.723 --> 33:16.395
audience member and offer him
$10,000 to cross this tightrope.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.765
And when the guy would get about halfway
across the tightrope, he'd shake it,

33:19.798 --> 33:23.402
and then the guy would fall off and get
impaled by a spike, it was awesome.

33:23.435 --> 33:29.741
But I saw the show 10 times,
and every time I saw the show,

33:29.775 --> 33:32.945
exact same audience member,
exact same fall,

33:32.979 --> 33:37.049
exact same spike, and that's right
when we had the fire 20 years ago.

33:37.083 --> 33:40.386
You know the burning man, we all thought
it was just a big freaking Kane joke.

33:40.419 --> 33:43.789
I can't believe you guys haven't
seen this trick a million times.

33:43.822 --> 33:46.892
Think about it, it's obvious
if you think about it.

33:46.925 --> 33:49.728
Jake is working with Kane.

33:49.928 --> 33:50.929
Yep.

33:52.398 --> 33:55.334
I guess you're right, I mean, we
are at a haunted house attraction.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.903
They are supposed to
be scaring us, right?

33:57.936 --> 34:01.507
Let's just go check out the next room.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.009
It's all right man, come on.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.377
Nice try, Spooky the Clown.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.522
I just saved you guys 250 G's.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.539
Both doors are locked.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.574
So where do we go now?

34:36.975 --> 34:39.145
Maybe there was a hidden
message in the video.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.911
Well it's not like we
can see that in here.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.581
That guy filmed it.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.116
I have a name, you know?

34:44.150 --> 34:46.385
Yeah it's Marky Mark.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.221
Hey man that's a compliment,
he was the voice of a generation.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.190
Well... / Can we see the video? /
Sure.

35:02.301 --> 35:06.238
Well hello my marvelous
little martyrs. / It's looped.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.540
What?
What is that supposed to mean?

35:08.574 --> 35:11.843
It's looped, it's a different voice

35:11.877 --> 35:15.347
playing over an old Circus
Kane commercial from the 90's.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.216
How could you possibly know that?

35:17.249 --> 35:19.285
Dude, I play these
commercials all the time

35:19.318 --> 35:22.388
in my shop, Big Ed's Hoarder
Heaven on 3rd and Main.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.923
Everything's different
except the last line,

35:24.956 --> 35:28.827
the last line's the same in the old
commercial and the new commercial.

35:28.860 --> 35:32.364
Let the darkness guide you.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.667
I think that's a clue.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.836
What does it mean?

35:37.869 --> 35:40.372
I'll tell you what it means.

35:43.609 --> 35:47.113
I have no idea what it means.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.782
You're a genius.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.587
Black lights?

35:55.621 --> 35:57.123
Guys, look.

35:59.825 --> 36:00.659
Okay.

36:06.198 --> 36:06.998
Nothing.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.737
Got something.

36:11.770 --> 36:12.904
Is there anything in there?

36:12.938 --> 36:14.206
I'm checking.

36:17.209 --> 36:20.946
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a key.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.315
I'll take that, thank you.

36:31.390 --> 36:34.860
All right guys, let's get out of here.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.428
That was easy.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.698
Yeah, because you didn't do anything.

36:51.343 --> 36:54.112
Whoa. / What reeks?

36:57.816 --> 36:59.251
Shit, it's locked.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.988
Well look for some
more arrows or something.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.591
God, it looks so real.

37:05.624 --> 37:06.858
Even the smell.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.362
You don't think...

37:11.563 --> 37:13.599
Oh it's moving.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.167
It's trying to say something.

37:15.201 --> 37:21.540
My little piggies, you're doing so swell
climbing deeper into hell.

37:21.573 --> 37:26.778
You will need to find
the key to set me free.

37:26.812 --> 37:31.082
You are the apple of my eye.

37:32.784 --> 37:33.619
Goodbye.

37:34.986 --> 37:38.390
This is easy, we just gotta find a key.

37:39.758 --> 37:43.195
Well it's a small room,
let's start looking.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.603
Nothing over here so far.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.512
I found something.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.281
What makes you say that?

38:02.314 --> 38:04.350
The bear and an apple.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.051
The apple of my eye.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.588
Does anybody have a knife?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.390
Actually I got one.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.362
Wouldn't have expected
Marky Mark to be a Boy Scout.

38:16.395 --> 38:20.432
Oh it's because I'm wicked
smart Big Ed, wicked fuckin' smart.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.133
Say hello to your mother for me.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.503
There's something in here.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.343
Say hello to my little key.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.578
Anybody want to try it out?

38:32.611 --> 38:36.615
It's the key to my heart,
don't break it.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.818
You would have a little key, Big Ed.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.022
It doesn't work.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.222
What do you mean it doesn't work?

38:45.223 --> 38:47.926
I mean it's too small, it doesn't fit.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.728
She literally just said that.

38:49.761 --> 38:53.665
I've never had that problem, but
we're trying to solve riddles here.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.701
You know, for a haunted
house attraction,

38:55.734 --> 38:58.136
this house has more riddles
than it does scares.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.172
Wait hold on, let me see that key.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.245
That's 'cause this goes to a padlock.

39:07.279 --> 39:08.747
How did you know that?

39:08.780 --> 39:12.684
I used to steal shit, that's why
I owe people money and I'm here.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.726
Dope.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.260
Now what, genius?

39:25.464 --> 39:27.399
OK, here goes nothing.

39:30.336 --> 39:31.503
It's not real.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.574
Oh God. / Oh yeah!

39:35.607 --> 39:38.276
Oh God. / It stinks.

39:42.514 --> 39:45.817
Hold on, there's something in here.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.553
What is it?

39:47.586 --> 39:50.188
Can't find it, oh God.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.327
Oh it's just a speaker.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.832
There's nothing...
there's no key or anything.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.368
It's in the eye.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.204
That's really gross.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.306
Well who wants to try out that theory?

40:08.340 --> 40:11.410
Somebody help me out, come
on, want to help me out?

40:11.443 --> 40:12.277
Nope.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.149
Seriously, nobody?

40:18.183 --> 40:20.285
I'm lactose intolerant.

40:21.353 --> 40:22.854
Fine, I'll do it.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.290
All right.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.460
I knew I liked you.

40:38.870 --> 40:39.871
Oh God.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.608
That's awesome.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.383
Oh there we go, there we go.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.252
There's the key.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.454
Get the key.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.322
Ooh, it's slimy.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.627
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

41:03.429 --> 41:06.598
This room creeps me out, oh God.

41:10.669 --> 41:14.873
What was ahead of us was the worst
things anyone could ever imagine.

41:14.906 --> 41:19.077
It was the depths of hell and
we were going in willingly.

41:29.354 --> 41:30.321
We got a demon.

41:30.355 --> 41:33.191
What the hell, that's not cool.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.560
And two rooms.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.063
More obstacles, 'cause
that's not annoying.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.265
Like for sure, what's a matter,

41:40.298 --> 41:42.367
don't you have an app for that?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.735
Bring it on...

41:45.403 --> 41:47.272
Do you think you're funny?

41:47.305 --> 41:49.140
Just wondering 'cause it's sad.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.842
That's a good one.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.012
Hey.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.382
Don't I know you?

41:59.217 --> 42:02.053
You were in Night Terror with me.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.255
Did you audition for that?

42:06.792 --> 42:09.360
It is a ticket booth, maybe
we should take a ticket.

42:09.394 --> 42:11.730
That's a really good idea.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.700
Hi.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.502
Seven tickets, please.

42:30.816 --> 42:32.117
One.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.151
I'm a one.

42:37.989 --> 42:39.525
I'm a two.

42:39.558 --> 42:40.559
I'm a one.

42:45.163 --> 42:50.035
So I guess we should go to the door
that corresponds with our cards?

42:51.336 --> 42:54.139
Yeah sounds about right.

42:54.172 --> 42:56.708
Hey um bro, could I switch with you,

42:56.742 --> 42:59.811
I think I would be better in this group?

42:59.845 --> 43:02.147
We're good here, you should
probably help out grandpa.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.549
Really, because I'd really like...

43:03.582 --> 43:05.917
Dude, she said no. / Okay.

43:14.860 --> 43:18.063
Please help me Obi-Wan,
you're our only hope.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.331
Wow, that's a really old reference.

43:20.365 --> 43:23.569
My God, you people live in caves.

43:23.602 --> 43:25.604
Check out those photos.

43:25.637 --> 43:27.205
Look at the clowns.

43:28.073 --> 43:29.875
Each one they go down.

43:29.908 --> 43:31.776
I think we're supposed to open
the doors at the same time.

43:31.777 --> 43:33.745
How did you get that?

43:33.779 --> 43:35.113
Three two one.

43:37.816 --> 43:40.886
On one, at the same time.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.721
Knob in hand, good to go.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.255
Three, two, one.

43:48.326 --> 43:49.995
God dammit.

43:50.028 --> 43:52.063
Oh Jesus, it's hot in here.

43:52.097 --> 43:53.899
Maybe it's because you're here.

43:53.932 --> 43:54.933
Thank you.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.303
That looks dangerous.

43:58.336 --> 43:59.170
What?

44:01.139 --> 44:05.310
Shit. What the hell are we
supposed to do with this?

44:07.312 --> 44:08.513
Check it out.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.919
Follow the yellow brick road?

44:16.021 --> 44:16.855
I guess.

44:18.824 --> 44:21.927
Okay, we got stumps, what do we do?

44:23.128 --> 44:24.796
I imagine we have to hop across them.

44:24.830 --> 44:28.967
That's ridiculous, why wouldn't
we just walk around them?

44:29.868 --> 44:34.706
Shit ah! / You okay.

44:36.507 --> 44:40.045
Can't walk across it,
the floor's super-heated.

44:40.078 --> 44:41.913
Fuck, I'll go first.

44:43.081 --> 44:46.451
All right, I guess I'm going first.

44:48.887 --> 44:52.390
Would you care to? /
That's all you, girl.

45:03.434 --> 45:04.703
What's that sound?

45:04.736 --> 45:07.538
Oh fuck!

45:07.572 --> 45:08.874
What happened?

45:09.941 --> 45:10.909
Oh God.

45:10.942 --> 45:11.910
What happened?

45:11.943 --> 45:12.978
The fucking thing cut me.

45:13.011 --> 45:14.813
This is like really dangerous.

45:14.846 --> 45:17.649
No fucking shit, it's fucking real.

45:17.683 --> 45:20.551
I guess $250,000 makes
it worth the risk.

45:20.585 --> 45:24.355
So I guess uh, I'll time it. Fuck!

45:24.389 --> 45:25.456
Be careful.

45:35.033 --> 45:37.202
Those look really sharp.

45:41.239 --> 45:44.175
These are sharp, guys, be careful.

45:49.815 --> 45:52.483
Crawl through. / Let's do this.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.691
Don't you think this is a little
fucked up to do to people?

47:06.724 --> 47:07.759
Be careful!

47:31.917 --> 47:33.651
The walls are heated.

47:40.558 --> 47:41.559
Come on, let's go.

47:41.592 --> 47:42.427
Hold on.

48:01.512 --> 48:03.849
Here, give me your jacket.

48:08.053 --> 48:14.092
All right, just hold onto this and
just slide through, like a penguin.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.160
What?

48:15.193 --> 48:17.562
Keep your head down,
I'm gonna pull you through

48:17.595 --> 48:18.628
and you just slide right on through.

48:18.629 --> 48:19.965
One, two, three.

48:23.201 --> 48:24.602
Ah stop, stop!

48:25.503 --> 48:26.737
Are you okay?

48:26.771 --> 48:28.539
Hell no, I ain't okay, I'm hooked.

48:28.573 --> 48:29.674
Can you go back?

48:29.707 --> 48:31.142
No, I can't move, dammit.

48:31.176 --> 48:32.810
What do we do? / I don't know.

48:32.844 --> 48:34.279
We pull.

48:34.312 --> 48:35.280
No, what?

48:35.313 --> 48:36.781
What?! / We pull him through.

48:36.814 --> 48:38.449
No, no, no, no, no!

48:38.483 --> 48:41.052
Come on, it's not that bad,
it's just your shirt mostly.

48:41.086 --> 48:43.421
It's not my shirt, it's
my skin, how do you know?

48:43.454 --> 48:44.755
Stop being such a pussy.

48:44.789 --> 48:46.124
I'm not!

48:46.157 --> 48:47.358
You sure?

48:47.392 --> 48:50.028
Do you take your band-aids
off fast or slow?

48:50.061 --> 48:51.496
Fast. / Me too.

48:55.133 --> 48:57.468
Oh God, Mommy.

48:58.303 --> 49:00.171
There you go, big man.

49:00.205 --> 49:03.808
Son of a bitch, you could've killed me.

49:03.841 --> 49:05.476
Easy, easy, you're okay.

49:05.510 --> 49:07.412
Hey, it's not even that bad.

49:07.445 --> 49:08.679
And it's over now, okay?

49:08.713 --> 49:11.716
Seriously?! / Lemme see.

49:12.283 --> 49:14.920
Come on, I've had
periods with heavier flows.

49:14.953 --> 49:18.656
Fine, let's just get out of here.

49:18.689 --> 49:22.193
But you stay away from me,
you understand?

49:25.230 --> 49:29.400
Let's just make it out
of this alive, okay guys?

49:39.911 --> 49:41.179
Come on, guys.

49:58.964 --> 50:01.399
You okay?

50:01.432 --> 50:02.433
No!

50:03.834 --> 50:04.835
It's locked.

50:06.871 --> 50:08.974
There's no way out. / This.

50:10.508 --> 50:11.776
No, okay.

50:11.809 --> 50:13.478
Look for a mallet.

50:18.616 --> 50:21.452
I don't see anything,
just a bunch of bears.

50:28.960 --> 50:31.029
Should we ask for a hint?

50:37.035 --> 50:39.737
I don't see anything.
There!

50:39.770 --> 50:42.340
Yes!
Kane, can we have a hint?

50:44.976 --> 50:45.810
Look.

50:50.048 --> 50:51.216
It's locked.

50:51.249 --> 50:52.817
It's a jack in the box.

50:52.850 --> 50:54.252
Look for a crank.

51:02.860 --> 51:06.364
They have little cranks.
They have little cranks, crank those.

51:11.369 --> 51:15.540
I hear something, don't stop,
something's happening.

51:17.808 --> 51:18.643
Nothing.

51:45.170 --> 51:46.504
Where'd he go?

51:49.006 --> 51:50.441
He's gone.

51:52.577 --> 51:55.380
This place looks like
my grandma's house.

51:55.413 --> 51:58.149
So you've inherited her good taste.

51:58.183 --> 51:59.184
Eat a dick.

51:59.217 --> 52:00.485
All right, enough.

52:00.518 --> 52:02.086
Can you guys just put
your differences aside

52:02.087 --> 52:05.556
so we can work together
and figure this out?

52:05.590 --> 52:08.959
Come on, look around,
find some clues or something.

52:08.993 --> 52:10.228
Look at this.

52:14.665 --> 52:17.168
Seems kind of obvious, right?

52:24.609 --> 52:28.946
It's locked, looks
like we need another key.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.316
Well isn't that wonderful?

52:32.049 --> 52:36.487
Well it's got to be here,
so everybody spread out.

52:36.521 --> 52:39.457
I'll start in this pile right here.

52:41.592 --> 52:43.428
I'll take this pile.

52:55.940 --> 52:58.109
Fucking hate clowns.

52:58.143 --> 53:00.145
Honestly, who doesn't?

53:12.923 --> 53:14.058
Did you see that?

53:14.091 --> 53:16.227
See what? / It's fucking eyes moved.

53:16.261 --> 53:17.262
What?

53:18.863 --> 53:20.097
What?

53:26.103 --> 53:26.804
Oh my God!

53:32.510 --> 53:34.412
Oh my God, oh my God.

53:42.019 --> 53:43.621
I didn't sign up for this.

53:43.654 --> 53:46.691
It's 250 G's, it's not worth this.

53:46.724 --> 53:48.393
Kane, let us out, we're done.

53:48.426 --> 53:51.095
Guys, I know it's fucked up,
but I think I'm gonna stay.

53:51.128 --> 53:52.597
What?

53:52.630 --> 53:56.934
What, are you mental,
you see what he did to me?

53:56.967 --> 53:59.170
He bit off my finger, you
want to lose some fingers?

53:59.204 --> 54:02.607
No I don't, but I'd rather lose a
finger than lose my little brother.

54:02.640 --> 54:05.443
They're gonna take him away from
me if I don't bring in some cash.

54:05.476 --> 54:09.280
Then help us find the key, we still
need a key to get out of this room.

54:11.682 --> 54:14.084
I got it, I've got the key! /
Here, here, here!

54:20.625 --> 54:23.194
Must've done something right.

54:27.198 --> 54:28.866
Nothing's happening.

54:31.168 --> 54:33.137
I want to get out! / What?

54:33.170 --> 54:34.539
I want to go back to my basement!

54:34.572 --> 54:35.806
Why isn't anything happening?

54:35.840 --> 54:36.741
Nothing's happening.

54:36.774 --> 54:37.775
Oh my God.

54:38.709 --> 54:41.145
It's not working, come on.

54:41.178 --> 54:42.347
Let me out of here!

54:42.380 --> 54:45.716
Come on, come on! / Let me out!

54:45.750 --> 54:47.485
The words, what did
Kane say in the video?

54:47.518 --> 54:49.654
The words that we have to
say if we want to leave.

54:49.687 --> 54:52.022
Okay, it was Balthazar Kane.

54:52.056 --> 54:52.723
Balthazar Kane!

54:53.524 --> 54:54.525
Balthazar Kane.

54:54.559 --> 54:56.060
What?!

54:56.093 --> 54:57.595
Balthazar Kane, you win again.

54:57.928 --> 54:59.196
Balthazar Kane, you win again.

54:59.297 --> 55:01.566
Balthazar Kane, you win again.

55:01.599 --> 55:03.368
You win again!

55:21.185 --> 55:22.019
Billy?

55:29.226 --> 55:30.661
Billy.

55:30.895 --> 55:31.896
Billy.

55:32.397 --> 55:33.698
No Billy.

55:33.731 --> 55:36.133
Are you okay?
Oh my God.

55:45.510 --> 55:47.144
If he can do it, so can I.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.212
Roxy, no!

55:48.245 --> 55:49.347
Roxy, wait, no!

55:51.716 --> 55:53.217
Roxy, stop!

55:53.250 --> 55:56.120
Roxy, stop moving,
it's only making it worse.

55:59.156 --> 56:03.227
Stay still, stay still.

56:03.260 --> 56:05.262
Roxy, Roxy!

56:07.064 --> 56:08.966
I gotta get out of here.

56:23.147 --> 56:28.152
Roxy no, Roxy slow down!
Roxy, stop! Roxy, stop!

56:28.185 --> 56:29.754
No, I have to get out of here!

56:36.226 --> 56:37.094
Roxy, Roxy!

56:37.127 --> 56:38.363
Roxy, stop.

56:38.396 --> 56:40.164
Roxy, come back!

56:40.197 --> 56:44.134
We have to save her!
We have to save her, Roxy!

56:44.168 --> 56:46.337
You don't have to do this.

56:50.007 --> 56:51.776
I gotta go help her.

56:51.809 --> 56:52.643
Roxy?

56:54.712 --> 56:55.546
Roxy?

56:57.281 --> 56:58.115
Roxy?

56:59.350 --> 57:00.184
Tracy.

57:01.318 --> 57:02.887
Let me go!

57:11.061 --> 57:11.896
No.

57:12.863 --> 57:15.265
It's okay, it's all right.

57:17.602 --> 57:18.869
It's okay, shh.

57:31.482 --> 57:34.284
What gives you the right, Kane?

57:34.318 --> 57:37.354
Why, you do, Mr. Valentine.

57:37.388 --> 57:39.223
You give me the right.

57:40.425 --> 57:41.759
Now, please, go.

57:44.629 --> 57:48.499
I'll leave, sure, after
I get what's coming to me.

57:48.533 --> 57:50.835
What's that, Mr. Valentine?

57:50.868 --> 57:51.869
Prison time?

57:53.404 --> 57:57.575
Now, I've asked you to leave, politely.

57:59.176 --> 58:02.279
Now leave before I lose my patience.

58:02.312 --> 58:04.615
That property is mine, old man!

58:04.649 --> 58:06.717
I'm leaving here with it.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.286
You know, Mr. Valentine,
for the strong man in my show,

58:10.287 --> 58:14.625
you really are rather quite
weak, and quite pathetic.

58:14.659 --> 58:19.163
Now, you will leave my
tent and you are fired.

58:25.870 --> 58:26.704
No!

58:30.274 --> 58:31.275
No, Father!

58:40.017 --> 58:44.188
We've gotta do something,
we've gotta get out of here.

58:50.561 --> 58:52.897
We're getting out of here.

58:58.302 --> 58:59.436
Hello?

58:59.470 --> 59:00.705
911. What's your emergency?

59:00.738 --> 59:02.239
We need an ambulance right away.

59:02.272 --> 59:05.042
To what address?

59:05.075 --> 59:07.612
I don't know where I am.

59:07.645 --> 59:10.981
We can triangulate
where you are, please hold.

59:11.015 --> 59:12.049
Okay.

59:12.082 --> 59:13.250
What's going on?

59:13.283 --> 59:16.921
They're trying to
figure out where we are.

59:18.656 --> 59:21.592
We found you, we will
send over an ambulance

59:21.626 --> 59:25.429
right away, we will
be there in two hours.

59:25.462 --> 59:28.966
What?
This is an emergency, somebody died!

59:28.999 --> 59:31.802
Are you kidding me, two hours?

59:31.836 --> 59:33.704
This is the soonest we can get to you.

59:33.738 --> 59:36.406
You are very far away from
any emergency services.

59:36.440 --> 59:38.609
Send somebody, send the police.

59:38.643 --> 59:40.044
We will send a squad car as well.

59:40.077 --> 59:41.579
Fuck! / What?

59:41.612 --> 59:45.783
It's gonna be two hours
before anyone can get here.

59:49.019 --> 59:51.722
We find Kane, we find the
others, tell them what happened.

59:51.756 --> 59:53.858
Kane doesn't give a fuck,
haven't you noticed?!

59:53.891 --> 59:56.260
Don't be ridiculous, a person died.

59:56.293 --> 59:59.597
That's taking the scare
way too far, let's go.

59:59.630 --> 01:00:03.233
What are we gonna do with the body?

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.803
He's dead, Scott, we can't take him.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:09.640
We have to find Kane and find the
others and tell them what happened.

01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:12.276
We can come back for him later.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.382
What about the money?

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:21.318
Fuck the money, we're going home.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.376
Come on, let's go!

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:54.819
Go!

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:58.623
Here, give me your hand, let's go.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:00.858
We've gotta go, come on, let's go!

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:02.660
Give me your hand! / I can't!

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:05.062
You can do it. / Give me your hand!

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:07.097
Come on, let's go!

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:15.606
Next one, let's go, no breaks!

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:21.612
I'm sorry.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.921
Come on, let's go!

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:35.893
Come on, let's go!

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.930
Come on, time it out, let's go.
Go!

01:01:48.773 --> 01:01:49.840
Ed just got killed.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:51.408
Everyone else is dead.

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.077
Is this some kind of sick joke?

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.044
A joke?

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:56.213
We're not kidding,
they're all really dead.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.015
Roxy got ripped to shreds by barbed wire

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.488
and Billy got a hatchet to the back.

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:02.286
Well guess what?
I just called an ambulance,

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.221
the closest one is two hours away.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:08.325
Jesus Christ, what
the fuck do we do now?

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:09.393
We're all gonna die.

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:10.861
We're not gonna die.

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:14.364
No, it's okay, we just
gotta keep it together, okay?

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.767
I sure as shit know I'm not
gonna die at this house,

01:02:16.801 --> 01:02:18.534
so we just gotta get back
to where we came from,

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:21.839
start from the beginning and try
to find a way out of this, okay?

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:24.208
Let's get out of here, go!

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:36.020
Come on.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:40.858
Let us out!

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:44.313
Hold on, I can pick it.

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:45.495
What the hell?

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.031
How are you gonna do that?

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:48.532
With my pocket knife.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.134
You sure? / Yeah.

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:52.770
Oh that's gnarly.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:54.204
There's no use.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:01.011
Well there's no use just standing
around, help us, come on.

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:06.550
Hey was that thing there before?

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:07.384
No.

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:14.091
I'm not going in there.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:24.969
Uh guys, guys.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:27.772
Oh yes you are.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:31.541
Go now, go, go, go!

01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:39.583
What the fuck place is this?

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:43.187
In order to truly triumph,

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.323
one must travel to the depths of hell

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:49.459
and still come out on the other side.

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:53.697
Oh fuck that.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:58.869
Go, god dammit, Kane.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.942
This is not getting us anywhere, guys.

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:41.078
We have to keep pushing forward.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:42.980
What's that sound?

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:46.016
I don't know but it can't be good.

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:54.724
I think he wants to help us see.

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:56.927
Go grab those glow sticks.

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:05.269
Oh my God!

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:10.975
What?

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:15.279
It's just water, I'm fine.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:43.440
No!

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:46.470
No, no!

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.625
Hello, motherfucker!

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:18.602
We gotta keep going.

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.617
Who the hell is that?

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:35.819
Kane.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:10.987
Balthazar Kane, in the flesh.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.592
Or.. what remains.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:23.600
We're getting out of here, you psycho.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.304
In due time, boy.

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:30.073
In due time.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:37.781
Such a pity, you two came through for...

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.089
Almost at the end.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:51.828
Why?

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.098
Why would you do this?

01:08:54.131 --> 01:09:00.770
This magnificent
theater of pain and blood?

01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:09.379
Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:10.413
My boy...

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:19.055
I am the hunter who
eats the flesh of his prey.

01:09:19.089 --> 01:09:22.091
Calling the herd of mankind.

01:09:23.093 --> 01:09:30.033
One, two, three.

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:32.569
With my teeth and claws.

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:38.108
You're insane.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.515
Insane in the membrane.

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:50.520
Careful that's very sharp.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.364
Now am I insane or are you just

01:10:01.265 --> 01:10:05.769
too weak and pathetic and scared

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:10.240
to look into the abyss?

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:13.777
To stare into the faces
of all of God's monsters

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:18.815
on Heaven and Earth that await you
in the black hole of eternity?

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:28.892
I don't expect you
lemmings to understand a lion,

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:36.800
or an ant to comprehend a
giant's view of the world.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:42.172
You have no right, those people died.

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:45.242
Yes.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.649
They died, horrible painful,

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:59.889
beautiful, sublime deaths.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:04.761
Baptism of blood for the great horror
show that waits for all of us.

01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:13.169
You see boy, death is the one true God.

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:20.176
And I am death's tattered angel.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:28.818
Spreading her cold harsh words

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:33.089
one soul at a time.

01:11:34.358 --> 01:11:35.191
What?

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:45.168
Fear not, your death, your death

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:47.937
will have a place in history, yes.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:53.310
Your pain and suffering, and sacrifice

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:58.315
will grant you immortality at my side

01:11:58.348 --> 01:12:02.919
as a small part of my horror legacy.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:05.955
My... legacy.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:11.495
Balthazar Kane's legacy of horror.

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:18.335
No, I'm not gonna be
a part of your legacy.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.072
And if you don't let me out right now,

01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:25.409
I'm gonna gut you like a fucking fish.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:29.245
That's it, boy!
Gut me like a fish!

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:35.952
Gotta keep the show and
the people entertained

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:39.689
'til the very fucking end, now don't we?

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:43.092
Wouldn't want to disappoint your
fucking horror fans, would we?!

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:48.197
Gut me like a...

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:54.671
"And at its heels,
leashed in like hounds,

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:59.709
should famine, sword and fire,
crouch for employment.

01:13:01.311 --> 01:13:03.480
But pardon, gentles all."

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:12.288
"Cry havoc, let slip the dogs of war."

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:22.065
What is that?

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:24.133
What is that?

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:32.476
Run Tracy, run Tracy, run!

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:38.982
All right, play time is over.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.662
And then there were two.

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:05.341
Where are you, my little piggies?!

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:06.943
Where could you be?

01:14:22.526 --> 01:14:25.462
Those crazy fucks are still in here.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:26.396
Tracy, wait!

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:04.000
Fe, fi, fo, fum,

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:07.671
I smell the blood of
my piggies as they run.

01:15:18.482 --> 01:15:20.484
Shh, it's me, it's me.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:23.520
We need to split up.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:24.521
Are you insane?

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:26.222
It's the only way.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:32.028
So very nice of you to invite
me to play hide and seek.

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:34.598
No Scott, we can't.

01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.600
There's two of us, there's one of him,

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:38.400
there's other crazies but
we can sneak up on him

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:40.637
and then take care of them later.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.138
Trust me.

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:55.485
Oh my God!

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:04.060
And then, there were one.

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:12.335
Tracy my dear, did you know that the
human head weighs eight pounds?

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:16.973
Chop away, boys!

01:16:41.865 --> 01:16:44.433
Tracy my dear, where are you going?

01:16:44.467 --> 01:16:46.803
You're my last little piggy.

01:17:00.684 --> 01:17:02.719
Open the door.

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:05.254
Open the god damn door, dammit!

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:14.197
There she is, my final girl.

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:17.400
Such a perfect taboo for a finale.

01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:27.043
You, my sweetness, you must
be so, so very honored.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.847
What the hell do you want from me?

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.349
What the hell do you want from me?

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:37.987
No no no no no, we already
played that part of the show.

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:41.825
This is the fourth act,
that was the second act.

01:17:41.858 --> 01:17:44.661
Let me refresh your memory,
see I've been playing

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:48.531
the monologue-ing monster,
who loves the macabre,

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:52.836
being very politely,
very politely answering

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:56.305
all of your questions
and giving you hints.

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:59.542
And allowing you to
run all over my house

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:03.613
playing hide and seek,
which I do rather enjoy.

01:18:03.647 --> 01:18:09.653
But now, there is only one
little piggy and that's you.

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:13.456
And this is where we get down to the,

01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:16.592
well, my favorite part of the show.

01:18:16.626 --> 01:18:22.131
The bone, the blood,
the gristle and meat.

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:30.406
All right, let's make this
interesting, shall we?!

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:34.043
Let's add some stakes to
our final death match!

01:18:34.077 --> 01:18:35.244
Open the door!

01:18:35.278 --> 01:18:40.049
You've heard of the saying,
life is pain, haven't you?

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:46.622
Well this is a little game I
like to call, pain for life.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.759
How do you play that game, Johnny?
Let me tell ya

01:18:49.793 --> 01:18:52.161
right now how you to play the game.

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:54.764
All right, final girl, come on down,

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:59.068
you're our next contestant
on pain for your life!

01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:01.838
In this chest, what do we have?

01:19:01.871 --> 01:19:04.273
We have here on the side
a little magic button.

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:05.709
And what does that magic button do?

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:09.045
Well let me tell you, folks,
what the magic button does.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:14.417
It holds the key to all of final
girls dreams, desires, and hopes.

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.885
And what would they be?

01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:17.652
Well let me tell you folks
what those things are,

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:21.457
those are freedom,
the front door, security,

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.160
and a boring fucking life.

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:27.663
Isn't it amazing, final girl,

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:35.171
how one's life can
come down to one thing?

01:19:35.705 --> 01:19:37.440
And that one thing is...

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:44.347
surviving the pain.

01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:50.086
Naughty little piggy.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:57.160
That's it, final girl, I knew
you wouldn't disappoint.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:01.364
No no no.

01:20:19.883 --> 01:20:23.987
That was not very nice!

01:20:30.093 --> 01:20:31.594
Piggy piggy piggy!

01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:50.413
Tracy, my final girl.

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:52.048
Where are you going?!

01:20:52.081 --> 01:20:54.450
We're not done yet.

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:57.386
This is our denouement.

01:20:58.254 --> 01:21:01.357
Every show must have a proper ending.

01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:03.726
Are you okay?

01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:04.660
What?

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:05.961
Are you okay, Miss?
What's your name?

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:07.330
Tracy.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.398
We have to get out of here.

01:21:09.432 --> 01:21:12.168
Call it in, we have a
possible 187 and 245 A.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:14.137
No, no, no, you don't understand

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:15.872
he's still in there, he's coming.

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:17.606
Please come with me.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.977
No, you have to end this,
please you have to end this!

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:23.746
Tracy, my love, this has to end.

01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:33.022
Freeze, get your hands
up and get on the ground!

01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:36.492
Freeze, get your hands behind
you head and get on the ground.

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:37.961
Do it now!

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:39.495
I said freeze!

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:43.332
Sorry gentlemen, that's
not how this fairy tale plays.

01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:44.333
Stop!

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:45.768
No, not at all.

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:47.436
I'm not gonna warn you again,

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.072
get your hands up, drop the weapon,

01:21:49.105 --> 01:21:51.440
get down on the ground or we will fire.

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:55.511
"Why, man, doth bestride the
narrow world..."

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:59.282
Stop! Get down now! /
"...And we petty men."

01:21:59.315 --> 01:22:05.188
"Walk under his huge leg and peep about
to find ourselves dishonorable graves."

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:06.189
Drop the weapon now!

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:26.342
Magic is sacrifice.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:27.176
Freeze!

01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:42.291
That man tried to murder me.

01:22:42.325 --> 01:22:46.262
Look, I've got a house full of
booby traps and dead bodies.

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:50.066
And we have no clue how
any of this happened.

01:22:53.369 --> 01:22:54.203
Fine.

01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:57.240
Wait here.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:03.947
That girl's been through hell.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.481
Yes she has.

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:08.584
Here.

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:11.454
Check this out.

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:28.537
Well, your story checks out.

01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:32.441
The footage from the house backs up
everything you said so you're free to go.

01:23:39.949 --> 01:23:40.783
Thanks.

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:48.391
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:50.193
It's okay.

01:23:50.226 --> 01:23:52.228
You were just doing your job.

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:55.031
Well it must at least
give you some comfort

01:23:55.064 --> 01:23:56.904
knowing that monster Kane
who tried to kill you

01:23:56.932 --> 01:24:00.836
and burn your father, Robbie
Valentine, all those years ago,

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:03.939
well he finally got what he deserved.

01:24:05.308 --> 01:24:06.542
That monster.

01:24:08.444 --> 01:24:10.713
Goodnight, Miss Valentine.

01:24:10.746 --> 01:24:12.415
Goodnight, officer.

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:23.459
Endure the pain to learn true
magic, you must endure the pain.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:24.893
Magic, sacrifice.

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:35.071
It's almost done for us, darling.

01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:39.108
Valhalla waits for the
boast of warriors.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:56.292
Don't worry, Father,
you'll be out soon enough.

01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:04.300
The art of misdirection is the power,

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:08.971
to direct the audience's
attention in one direction,

01:25:09.004 --> 01:25:14.009
while making them
distracted from the other.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.880
Must go out with a bang.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:21.817
What if I can't do it,
what if I'm not good enough?

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:26.689
And our reward shall be immortality.
You ready?

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:29.158
It's show time.

01:25:29.192 --> 01:25:30.025
Okay.

01:25:43.606 --> 01:25:49.678
Welcome my future corpses,
to Circus Kane

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:55.351
where you'll see the most amazing
freak show ever known to man.

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:59.455
The two-headed woman, the dog-faced boy.

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:01.657
Where women are sawed in half,

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:07.263
where limbs are ripped and lions will
tear the entrails from the infidel.

01:26:07.296 --> 01:26:12.601
Here at Circus Kane, pain's
pleasure and pleasure is pain.

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:18.040
And we provide it all,
for your entertainment.

01:26:18.073 --> 01:26:24.447
So come on down and see...
what it's all about.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:27.916
At Circus Kane.

01:26:43.632 --> 01:26:46.735
This Halloween feed your fear.

01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:51.374
Fear, the hunger of your soul
begging to be tested.

01:26:51.407 --> 01:26:57.313
Be reborn with the new hippodrome
of horror, the new Circus Kane.

01:26:57.346 --> 01:27:00.783
The only experience from
the true undead legend

01:27:00.816 --> 01:27:05.754
of the macabre, Balthazar Kane,
went insane

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:09.658
and murdered them all for world acclaim.

01:27:09.692 --> 01:27:14.062
Now, his soul haunts
the house of that day.

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:19.568
Do you dare to go to his
valley of the shadow of death?

01:27:19.602 --> 01:27:23.105
Listen closely and
you'll feel his breath.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.908
See you soon.
