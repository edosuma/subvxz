00:16.475 --> 00:19.142
(ominous music)

02:33.187 --> 02:35.854
(bright music)

02:57.387 --> 02:59.470
- Well, that's all I got.

03:24.151 --> 03:28.151
I do not get paid enough
to deal with this shit.

03:44.511 --> 03:47.344
(phone vibrates)

03:48.240 --> 03:49.630
- Hello?

03:49.630 --> 03:50.910
- Hey, what are you up to?

03:50.910 --> 03:53.900
- I'm sure a lot more than
your lazy ass is doing.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.280
- Hey, listen. I've had a day from hell.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.050
- That's your excuse every day.

03:58.050 --> 04:00.790
Now, if I had to guess,
you're sitting at your desk

04:00.790 --> 04:02.950
with your feet propped
up and a vodka bottle

04:02.950 --> 04:04.240
is probably not that far away from you.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.883
- You know me so well.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.680
So, what are you up to?

04:10.680 --> 04:13.380
- I'm at the market picking
up some wine for later.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.710
- Do you think you can pick
me up another bottle of vodka?

04:16.710 --> 04:19.380
- You still owe me from the
last bottle I bought you.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.160
- Come on. You know I'm good for it.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.320
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.180
- So do you think Piper is
enjoying her birthday present?

04:26.180 --> 04:27.470
- I'm actually gonna give her a call

04:27.470 --> 04:28.620
to see how it's coming.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.210
- Skylar, drinking on the job again?

04:33.210 --> 04:35.510
- Um, Maddie, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.190
- I mean your sales,

04:38.190 --> 04:39.600
Frank down in accounting,

04:39.600 --> 04:41.400
he's on my back.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.890
I'm in charge of the sales floor here.

04:43.890 --> 04:45.880
What am I supposed to do?

04:45.880 --> 04:47.920
- Listen, just get off
my back for one day.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.203
I'm having a bad day.

04:51.144 --> 04:53.943
- I'm having a bad day 'cause
I have to deal with you.

04:53.943 --> 04:55.590
I need more out of you.

04:55.590 --> 04:57.470
Do you need to find another job?

04:57.470 --> 05:00.400
Do you need to go to Alcoholics
Anonymous or something?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.123
- You know what? Maybe I do.

05:03.430 --> 05:07.010
- Listen, I really need
you to put, you know,

05:07.010 --> 05:08.220
all your efforts into this.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.440
I need you to get out there,

05:09.440 --> 05:12.320
pound the pavement, get some new clients.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.890
We have a ton of jewelry to sell.

05:13.890 --> 05:16.000
This is a great opportunity, Skylar.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.320
You know, it's almost Halloween,

05:17.320 --> 05:18.570
and you know what's after Halloween?

05:18.570 --> 05:22.100
The holidays, gift giving, Christmas.

05:22.100 --> 05:25.380
Everybody's counting on
our department, you know,

05:25.380 --> 05:27.560
and we're not gonna make
bonus for the holidays.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.660
I really need your help here.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.550
- You know what?
(bottle scrapes)

05:30.550 --> 05:32.047
I really never liked you,

05:32.047 --> 05:35.710
but I do appreciate you
giving me some leeway

05:35.710 --> 05:38.910
and I'll try to cut back on the drinking,

05:38.910 --> 05:41.813
but I'll make better sales
if I do it while I'm drunk.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.350
- No, and you're gonna do it sober.

05:45.350 --> 05:48.100
And I want a progress report
from you every morning,

05:48.100 --> 05:50.020
Monday through Friday at 9:00 AM.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.870
So I have something to give to Frank.

05:53.610 --> 05:55.010
And I'm taking this with me.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.690
- Now I really need Maddie
to get me that bottle.

05:59.672 --> 06:02.172
(soft music)

06:37.960 --> 06:38.950
- What color did you wanna do?

06:38.950 --> 06:41.020
- Um, you can go ahead

06:41.020 --> 06:43.070
and just pick out a purple color.

06:43.070 --> 06:43.903
- Okay.

06:46.352 --> 06:47.330
Do you like this one?

06:47.330 --> 06:49.373
- Yes, that's perfect.
- Okay, awesome.

06:51.660 --> 06:54.190
So it's your birthday.
Do you have any plans?

06:54.190 --> 06:56.660
- Oh, me and the girls
are just going out later.

06:56.660 --> 06:58.250
- That'll be fun.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.470
My friend from work actually invited me

07:00.470 --> 07:02.920
to a birthday party for her cat tonight.

07:02.920 --> 07:06.280
So I'm not sure if I'm
gonna go to that yet or not.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.200
- That sounds very interesting.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.575
- Yeah, not sure what
that will all consist of.

07:10.575 --> 07:12.629
(both laugh)

07:12.629 --> 07:14.192
(phone rings)

07:14.192 --> 07:15.588
- Hold on one sec.

07:15.588 --> 07:17.210
- Okay.

07:17.210 --> 07:18.550
- Hello?

07:18.550 --> 07:20.361
- How's the pedi coming?

07:20.361 --> 07:21.970
- Oh, It's so relaxing.

07:21.970 --> 07:24.920
I didn't realize how bad I needed this.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.990
- Well, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

07:26.990 --> 07:27.823
- I so am.

07:28.764 --> 07:30.060
- If you think this is good,

07:30.060 --> 07:32.380
just wait until tonight.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.303
- Wait, what do you mean?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.853
- Well, just look in your purse.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.860
- No fucking way.

07:45.860 --> 07:48.283
You did not get us these tickets.

07:49.489 --> 07:52.340
- I knew you really wanted
them for your birthday.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.320
- Yeah, everyone knew I wanted them,

07:54.320 --> 07:55.920
but Ghost Town Roadshow sold out

07:55.920 --> 07:57.590
within minutes of going on sale.

07:57.590 --> 07:59.593
These tickets are impossible to get.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.290
- Not when your bestie's a slut.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.363
- You didn't, you whore.

08:06.460 --> 08:09.240
- Hey, the roadie was
cute. The sex was great.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.330
So technically ,the tickets were a bonus.

08:12.330 --> 08:15.190
- Oh my God. You are so unbelievable.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.903
But that's why I love you.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.510
- Oh, I love you too.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.590
Now, make sure you message
me when you get out of there

08:21.590 --> 08:24.010
so we can get together
for pre-birthday drinks.

08:24.010 --> 08:27.650
- For sure. I'll message you
as soon as I'm out of here.

08:27.650 --> 08:28.873
- Okay. See you soon.

08:29.830 --> 08:31.033
- Okay. Bye.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.203
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:36.727 --> 08:38.723
- $13.33.

08:38.723 --> 08:39.890
- Here you go.

08:43.180 --> 08:44.470
- Need a receipt?

08:44.470 --> 08:45.960
- Nope, that's great.
- Awesome.

08:45.960 --> 08:46.900
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.

08:46.900 --> 08:47.817
- You too.

08:50.311 --> 08:52.270
- I can't believe you got
tickets to that show tonight.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.540
I really wanted to go
so I'm really jealous.

08:54.540 --> 08:57.053
- I know, my friends spoil me so much.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.970
What's your favorite song?

08:59.970 --> 09:01.540
- I love "Grim Reaper."

09:01.540 --> 09:03.390
- Oh, that's one of my favorites too.

09:04.630 --> 09:05.930
- Hey.

09:05.930 --> 09:06.763
- Hey, what's up?

09:06.763 --> 09:09.630
- Hey, so your next one canceled.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.690
And then I was wondering if you were maybe

09:11.690 --> 09:13.643
gonna make it to my cat party tonight.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.970
- What time was it again?

09:16.970 --> 09:17.850
- Like 5:00, 5:30.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.920
- Okay, 'cause Josh wanted me
to go to the mall with him.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.570
So I don't think I'm
gonna be able to make it.

09:22.570 --> 09:24.780
- Oh, well, if you get back in time

09:24.780 --> 09:26.330
and you feel like coming, you can.

09:26.330 --> 09:30.070
I got a catnip cake and a bouncy house,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.900
um, and I got little hats too.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.220
So I'll bring you one
for your cat tomorrow,

09:33.220 --> 09:34.670
if you want me to.

09:34.670 --> 09:35.950
- I'm sure he'd love that.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.970
I'm sorry I can't come.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.490
I just have to go to the mall to pick up

09:38.490 --> 09:41.143
the new slasher movie, but
next year, count me in.

09:41.143 --> 09:41.976
- Okay.

09:44.361 --> 09:45.911
I'm not going to any cat party.

09:48.151 --> 09:51.068
(soft piano music)

10:16.560 --> 10:17.750
- Excuse me.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.370
I have a quick question.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.620
- Give me just one minute.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.453
- Okay.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.040
- Hello. Sorry about that.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.540
- Oh, oh, good.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.770
So firstly, I wanted to say

10:29.770 --> 10:31.893
this is the cutest
bookstore I've ever been in.

10:31.893 --> 10:33.450
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:33.450 --> 10:36.510
And second, so tonight, me and
my friends are going to Salem

10:36.510 --> 10:38.120
and I just wanted to brush up

10:38.120 --> 10:40.210
on the town's local history and folklore.

10:40.210 --> 10:41.890
So do you have anything like that?

10:41.890 --> 10:42.950
- Of course we do.

10:42.950 --> 10:44.723
We have plenty of books on Salem.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.310
You know, it's always
nice to see young people

10:49.310 --> 10:51.010
who are still interested in books.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.560
- Oh, I've always loved books

10:52.560 --> 10:53.780
ever since I was a little girl.

10:53.780 --> 10:56.150
- Me too, I've always said that books

10:56.150 --> 10:59.060
are like a window into a new world.

10:59.060 --> 10:59.956
Oh, shoot.
(book thuds)

10:59.956 --> 11:02.290
(ominous music)

11:02.290 --> 11:03.433
- What's this?

11:03.433 --> 11:05.060
- This isn't the book for you.

11:05.060 --> 11:07.160
- But why not?

11:07.160 --> 11:10.297
- This book is, it's special.

11:10.297 --> 11:11.130
- "Black Rainbow."

11:11.130 --> 11:13.560
What kind of book is this?"

11:13.560 --> 11:14.670
- This is a book that's been written

11:14.670 --> 11:16.600
by every person on earth.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.260
Everyone's thoughts, dreams,

11:18.260 --> 11:20.140
and fears make up "Black Rainbow."

11:20.140 --> 11:23.190
- Well what is "Black Rainbow" all about?

11:23.190 --> 11:26.010
- It is a collection of all
of the thoughts and vibrations

11:26.010 --> 11:27.420
from every sentient being

11:27.420 --> 11:29.970
that has ever wandered this dimension.

11:29.970 --> 11:32.940
The information has been
collected for millions of years

11:32.940 --> 11:34.240
through a practice. that's known

11:34.240 --> 11:35.943
as thought pattern extraction.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.401
- What is thought pattern extraction?

11:39.401 --> 11:42.210
- Transdimensional fallen
angels gather this data

11:42.210 --> 11:44.680
without the consent of conscious beings

11:44.680 --> 11:46.700
and place it into a
collective that's known

11:46.700 --> 11:49.480
as the "Black Rainbow" to be used later

11:49.480 --> 11:53.471
in ancient blood rituals and
cannibalistic sacrifices.

11:53.471 --> 11:56.180
- And how does something
like that end up here?

11:56.180 --> 11:57.617
(ominous music)

11:57.617 --> 12:00.023
- "Black Rainbow" is everywhere.

12:02.140 --> 12:04.090
You just have to know where to find it.

12:06.780 --> 12:07.820
No, no.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.343
This isn't the book for you.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.423
- [Man] Hey, do you have
any books on the flat earth?

12:14.450 --> 12:16.670
- These books up here are on Salem.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.180
Let me know if you need anything else.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.150
- Okay, thanks.

12:21.114 --> 12:23.781
(intense music)

12:31.718 --> 12:34.385
(ominous music)

13:21.267 --> 13:24.017
(phone vibrates)

13:27.980 --> 13:29.470
- Hello.

13:29.470 --> 13:31.000
- Hey, where you at?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.672
- I'm at this really cute new bookstore.

13:33.672 --> 13:35.920
- (scoffs) A bookstore again, huh?

13:35.920 --> 13:37.500
It's a wonder the boys
on the football team

13:37.500 --> 13:39.640
always call you bookworm Betty.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.930
- Yeah, well at least I didn't screw

13:40.930 --> 13:42.130
the whole football team.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.690
- Okay.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.120
Well I was just wondering
if you were going

13:46.120 --> 13:49.390
to meet up with us for
Piper's pre-birthday drinks.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.340
- Yeah, absolutely.

13:50.340 --> 13:52.260
I just have to go home
and change real quick.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.040
Where are we meeting again?

13:54.040 --> 13:57.240
- I was thinking that new place Lakeside.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.810
- Oh yeah. I heard they
have killer mojitos.

14:00.810 --> 14:03.100
- Oh, so you're actually
gonna drink today.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.890
Well, just hurry up.

14:04.890 --> 14:05.723
- All right. Sounds good.

14:05.723 --> 14:07.490
What time should I meet you?

14:07.490 --> 14:09.030
- Around two.

14:09.030 --> 14:10.140
- Perfect. Sounds good.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.090
I'll see you there.

14:17.194 --> 14:21.940
(gasps)
(ominous music)

14:21.940 --> 14:23.970
Oh, damn paper cuts.

14:25.054 --> 14:27.471
(soft music)

14:43.940 --> 14:44.890
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.840
- I figured I'd find you out here reading.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.380
- Oh yeah, I just went through
this new book store downtown.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.270
It's really cute.

14:51.270 --> 14:53.760
Just prepping for the Salem trip tonight.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.510
- You gonna do some with witchy shit?

14:55.510 --> 14:56.960
- Well, me and the
girls are actually going

14:56.960 --> 14:59.490
to a concert tonight for Piper's birthday.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.140
Here, come on up. I have Matilda out.

15:01.140 --> 15:02.140
So the dogs can have
- Come on.

15:02.140 --> 15:03.841
- a little play date while we catch up.

15:03.841 --> 15:06.258
(dog pants)

15:07.994 --> 15:11.161
Mathilda's so happy to see you, honey.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.143
Mathilda, look who's here.

15:15.143 --> 15:16.560
- Come here.
- Check it out.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.399
- Russ is like, I want no part of that.

15:18.399 --> 15:20.249
(chuckles)

15:20.249 --> 15:22.177
- Pretty girl.

15:22.177 --> 15:23.560
Come here.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.700
So who are you guys gonna go see?

15:25.700 --> 15:27.440
- We're gonna go see Ghost Town Road Show.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.310
Maddie scored us tickets
even though they're sold out.

15:30.310 --> 15:31.143
- Oh, that's gonna be great.

15:31.143 --> 15:32.440
That's like Piper's favorite.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.800
- I know we also ended up
getting her appointment

15:34.800 --> 15:36.730
to get her fortune told by Madam Sapphire,

15:36.730 --> 15:38.460
this new lady from Ireland.

15:38.460 --> 15:39.920
She's supposed to be like really good.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.210
- Oh my God.

15:41.210 --> 15:44.160
- So yeah, it should be
a pretty eventful day.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.410
What's new with you?

15:45.410 --> 15:48.290
- Well actually, I just got my nails done.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.250
- Ooh.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.820
Now that's some witchy shit.

15:50.820 --> 15:51.790
- I know, right?

15:51.790 --> 15:53.540
Tis the season.
- Mm-hmm.

15:54.790 --> 15:57.260
- Ooh, what kind of books did you get?

15:57.260 --> 15:58.670
- Just a bunch of stuff on Salem

15:58.670 --> 16:00.030
since we're gonna be up there.

16:00.030 --> 16:02.260
Folklore, witch trial stuff,

16:02.260 --> 16:03.900
but that one's called the "Black Rainbow"

16:03.900 --> 16:05.590
and the bookstore lady
tried to freak me out

16:05.590 --> 16:07.530
with a bunch of crazy stuff about it.

16:07.530 --> 16:09.920
I don't know. I think it's
just a bunch of dumb stuff.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.120
- That's kind kinda creepy.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.060
- Yeah.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.360
- So what even did she tell you?

16:14.360 --> 16:16.650
- Well, she started spouting off about

16:16.650 --> 16:20.570
it's made up of everyone's
feelings and dreams and fears

16:20.570 --> 16:22.620
and then it ended with cannibalistic

16:22.620 --> 16:24.580
and satanic sacrifices.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.440
Yeah, I don't believe
in any of that garbage,

16:26.440 --> 16:28.200
but the pages are
definitely sharp as hell.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.941
So just be careful because I
cut my finger on it earlier.

16:30.941 --> 16:32.480
- Oh fuck.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.720
Well Oliver's obviously
getting pretty antsy

16:34.720 --> 16:36.390
so I should probably leave,

16:36.390 --> 16:37.984
if that's all right.
- Thanks for stopping by.

16:37.984 --> 16:39.354
- Mm-hmm, definitely give me a call

16:39.354 --> 16:40.387
whenever you get back.

16:40.387 --> 16:41.652
- I will for sure.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.069
(soft music)

16:45.021 --> 16:46.460
Say bye, Mathilda.
- Bye.

16:54.539 --> 16:55.372
- Say bye.

16:57.358 --> 17:00.358
(upbeat rock music)

17:37.160 --> 17:39.140
- Now this is my kind of place.

17:39.140 --> 17:42.231
- Yeah, you like any
place that serves alcohol.

17:42.231 --> 17:43.064
- Right.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.217
- You ladies have a
seat wherever you like.

17:46.217 --> 17:49.217
(upbeat rock music)

18:00.170 --> 18:03.223
- Well, nothing like getting
our buzz on at 2:00 PM.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.780
I mean, I usually started at nine,

18:05.780 --> 18:07.380
so it's really nothing.

18:07.380 --> 18:09.890
- You're a fucking alcoholic.

18:09.890 --> 18:10.870
- Well I never drink at all,

18:10.870 --> 18:12.936
so this is gonna be a
whole new thing for me.

18:12.936 --> 18:15.517
(upbeat rock music)

18:15.517 --> 18:18.130
- All right, what can I
get you ladies to drink?

18:18.130 --> 18:20.503
- Can I have a vodka on the rocks.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.993
- Um, I'll take a Jack and Coke.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.333
- I'll have a Bahama Mama.
- Bahama Mama.

18:29.683 --> 18:30.913
- Skylar, any suggestions?

18:30.913 --> 18:32.533
I don't do this very often.

18:33.950 --> 18:35.400
- Just give her a vodka cran.

18:39.008 --> 18:40.308
- Hey, I got their drinks.

18:41.713 --> 18:43.546
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

18:45.910 --> 18:48.180
- Have you guys ever seen
Ghost Town Road Show before?

18:48.180 --> 18:49.584
- No.
- That's a negative.

18:49.584 --> 18:51.800
- Me and Skylar went last time
and all I could think about

18:51.800 --> 18:53.210
was how you guys would love it.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.480
The girls are crazy.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.460
- Yeah, they are.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.530
And dude, Marshall is so hot.

18:57.530 --> 19:00.080
I could stare at him the whole time.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.220
- Well, you can talk about
Marshall all you want,

19:02.220 --> 19:04.540
but the drummer's where it's at.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.020
- You know how I said
that concert got crazy

19:07.020 --> 19:08.220
last time we were there.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.803
I definitely threw my bra up on stage.

19:11.803 --> 19:13.026
(all laugh)

19:13.026 --> 19:15.893
- I will most certainly
not be doing that tonight.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.390
- Dude, you, just throw your bra, come on.

19:20.390 --> 19:21.940
It's your first concert.
- No.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.137
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.

19:26.137 --> 19:28.130
- Now that's fancy.
- Thanks.

19:28.130 --> 19:29.330
- Yeah.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.710
- So, Lilly, did you find anything cool

19:31.710 --> 19:33.340
at the book store earlier this morning?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.840
- Ah, some things.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.850
Most of it was just written
about the witch trials,

19:36.850 --> 19:38.860
which is pretty overplayed
'cause that's all

19:38.860 --> 19:40.460
Salem is known for.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.550
- Speaking of the Salem Witch Trials,

19:42.550 --> 19:43.530
the place where I grew up,

19:43.530 --> 19:45.990
it had a town called Hexi
and it was actually famous

19:45.990 --> 19:47.400
for its witch.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.040
So apparently when this
little girl was growing up,

19:50.040 --> 19:52.460
her parents died and they
used to play doctor with her.

19:52.460 --> 19:54.950
So I don't really know what that means.

19:54.950 --> 19:58.280
But later on, as she
grew up, she, thank you.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.113
- Thank you.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.630
- She became a witch
and she cursed the land.

20:03.630 --> 20:07.180
And actually this one family
died from drinking, the water,

20:07.180 --> 20:10.800
the rabbits, the squirrels,
everything was poisoned.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.050
And later the constable
found her in her house

20:13.050 --> 20:15.100
with maggots in her head.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.360
So yeah, that's where I grew up.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.700
- I feel like you've been drinking

20:18.700 --> 20:20.910
just a little too much, Skylar.

20:20.910 --> 20:22.050
- No, I'm serious.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.480
This happened.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.160
- Well, if it is true,
hopefully there's a book on it,

20:26.160 --> 20:27.460
'Cause I'd like to read about it

20:27.460 --> 20:30.270
'cause that sounds right up my alley.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.341
- What a nerd.

20:31.341 --> 20:32.980
(all laugh)

20:32.980 --> 20:34.340
- Actually, this is really good.

20:34.340 --> 20:35.960
Good suggestion, Sky.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.220
- You're welcome.

20:37.220 --> 20:39.040
- Piper, we have another surprise for you.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.950
- What? You guys have
already outdone yourselves

20:41.950 --> 20:43.650
with all this birthday stuff.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.090
- Well, if you don't want the surprise,

20:45.090 --> 20:47.610
we'll just go to the mall
and spend it on ourselves.

20:47.610 --> 20:48.600
- No, no.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.850
What is it already?

20:49.850 --> 20:50.920
- Okay. Okay.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.580
Are you ready?
- Yes.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.130
- Lilly, will you do the honor?

20:55.020 --> 20:57.750
- So Piper, we are taking
you for a palm reading

20:57.750 --> 21:00.200
at this new psychic over on 14th Ave.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.050
She's supposed to be the best around,

21:02.050 --> 21:03.653
and she moved here from Ireland.

21:04.540 --> 21:05.480
- Jesus Christ.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.413
I hope it's not that gook, Madam Sapphire.

21:08.413 --> 21:10.860
- What the hell does her
moving here from Ireland

21:10.860 --> 21:12.950
have to do with her being the best around?

21:12.950 --> 21:15.750
I mean, who the fuck
reads palms in Ireland?

21:15.750 --> 21:17.900
- Well, Miss Know It
All, it just so happens

21:17.900 --> 21:21.100
that all the best palm readers
originate from Ireland.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.810
I read it in a book once.

21:22.810 --> 21:23.933
- Of course you did.

21:24.780 --> 21:27.680
Guys, what does it matter
where she came from?

21:27.680 --> 21:30.630
I'm just excited to get my fortune told.

21:30.630 --> 21:32.249
- I knew you'd love that.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.332
(upbeat rock music)

21:37.363 --> 21:38.626
It's a real umbrella.

21:38.626 --> 21:40.371
(all laugh)

21:40.371 --> 21:43.204
(hard rock music)

23:07.047 --> 23:09.880
(mystical music)

23:17.390 --> 23:19.380
- Yeah, fuck this.

23:19.380 --> 23:20.790
- Oh no, you don't.

23:20.790 --> 23:21.910
This is Piper's present

23:21.910 --> 23:24.360
and you're going to stick
with us until the end.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.380
- How did you even hear
about this place again?

23:27.380 --> 23:30.600
- I saw a flyer at the Chinese
restaurant outside yesterday.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.030
- Thank God it wasn't
a flyer for a circus.

23:33.030 --> 23:35.730
Don't even look at it like
anyone's even working here.

23:38.010 --> 23:40.420
- Who has come to see Madam Sapphire?

23:40.420 --> 23:42.663
- Oh, Christ.

23:43.660 --> 23:47.093
- There's no taking the Lord's
name in vain in this house.

23:50.575 --> 23:52.930
(mystical music)

23:52.930 --> 23:55.280
- You better not ruin
Piper's birthday present.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.668
- Come this way, young
ladies, and enter my chamber.

24:00.668 --> 24:03.501
(mystical music)

24:21.828 --> 24:23.411
Have a seat ladies.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.680
So girls, let me tell you
a little bit about myself.

24:44.680 --> 24:49.680
I was born in Ireland in the
middle of a beautiful meadow.

24:51.180 --> 24:52.970
My mother knew I was gonna be special

24:52.970 --> 24:56.523
because a morning star shot
from the sky that morning.

24:57.820 --> 25:01.870
I always knew all kinds of things.

25:01.870 --> 25:06.080
And I knew when my
mother was going to pass

25:06.080 --> 25:09.170
and I really didn't want to tell her that.

25:09.170 --> 25:12.133
So I hopped the plane
and I came to the U.S.

25:13.010 --> 25:15.310
and that's why I'm here today,

25:15.310 --> 25:16.948
to help people in distress.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.781
(mystical music)

25:24.470 --> 25:27.833
So Piper, I hear it's your birthday.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.290
- Um, I'm Piper, Madam Sapphire.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.370
- Shouldn't you have known that?

25:36.310 --> 25:39.823
- Well, do you girls have
your cell phones on you?

25:40.700 --> 25:41.653
- [All] Yeah.

25:42.580 --> 25:45.350
- It's scrambling my psychic signals.

25:45.350 --> 25:47.720
So you really need to turn
them off and hand them to me

25:47.720 --> 25:49.770
so I can put them in the lobby.

25:49.770 --> 25:51.763
- What, you mean your living room?

25:53.601 --> 25:55.684
(sighs)

26:01.130 --> 26:01.963
- Thank you.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.901
(phones clatter)

26:16.513 --> 26:19.763
So young Piper, let me see your hand.

26:24.090 --> 26:27.283
Ooh, your heart line is very strong.

26:27.283 --> 26:28.890
(ominous music)

26:28.890 --> 26:30.208
But your lifeline...

26:30.208 --> 26:32.519
(gasps)

26:32.519 --> 26:34.656
- What?

26:34.656 --> 26:37.570
(sighs)

26:37.570 --> 26:39.903
- Let's just move on to the tarot cards.

26:47.510 --> 26:49.513
Shuffle the cards please, Piper.

27:05.010 --> 27:06.133
Card one.

27:08.890 --> 27:09.913
The rainbow.

27:12.270 --> 27:15.520
Happiness, joy pleasure,

27:15.520 --> 27:17.960
peace and contentment.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.343
Sounds like a wonderful start to your day.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.073
The hangman.

27:25.920 --> 27:30.920
Transition, change and
reversal of one's way of life.

27:36.950 --> 27:38.443
The falling tower.

27:43.290 --> 27:45.083
Sudden change,

27:46.380 --> 27:50.823
abandonment and end of long friendships.

27:58.437 --> 28:01.210
(ominous music)

28:01.210 --> 28:02.043
The devil.

28:06.330 --> 28:08.820
- What? Why are you
looking at me that way?

28:08.820 --> 28:11.070
- Yeah, come on guys.
This place is bullshit.

28:12.808 --> 28:15.800
(ominous music)

28:15.800 --> 28:18.710
- Wait, you have to listen to me!

28:18.710 --> 28:20.563
You're in grave danger!

28:21.550 --> 28:23.613
- Get off of me, you crazy bitch!

28:38.410 --> 28:40.260
- Wait girls, you forgot your phones.

28:42.150 --> 28:43.693
Please be careful.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.465
(children playing)

29:02.920 --> 29:05.230
- Thank God we're away
from that psychic bitch.

29:05.230 --> 29:07.430
- I know, we came here for a good time

29:07.430 --> 29:10.750
and she tries to soil our
evening with a black cloud.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.890
- How you feeling, Pipes?

29:11.890 --> 29:13.780
- I'm okay.

29:13.780 --> 29:15.960
How long till we get to Salem?

29:15.960 --> 29:17.290
- Well, the band starts at nine,

29:17.290 --> 29:18.620
so we've gotta get on the road now

29:18.620 --> 29:21.012
because we have dinner yet to go.

29:21.012 --> 29:23.679
(upbeat music)

30:22.580 --> 30:24.590
- [Piper] Guys, I really
don't know how to thank you

30:24.590 --> 30:26.090
for such an amazing birthday.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.380
- Aw, oh, you're so welcome.

30:28.380 --> 30:29.490
How has the pedi?

30:29.490 --> 30:31.960
- Oh God, it was the
most relaxing experience

30:31.960 --> 30:34.720
I've had in forever and
the lady, she was so nice.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.010
She hooked me up with
a pumpkin spice latte

30:37.010 --> 30:38.660
and an apple cider donut.

30:38.660 --> 30:41.490
- No way, a foot massage and a free latte?

30:41.490 --> 30:42.893
Sign me up for that shit.

30:43.810 --> 30:45.793
- Sounds like a daydream to me.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.010
- Well, you better take notes

30:48.010 --> 30:49.840
because my birthday's in a few months,

30:49.840 --> 30:53.573
but instead of pumpkin spice,
I want peppermint schnapps.

30:56.260 --> 30:58.110
- Well, I really can't believe you guys

30:58.110 --> 30:59.700
got us tickets for the show tonight.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.610
It's going to be a blast.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.960
- I cannot wait to see Marshall
and have him sing to me.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.760
He's so fucking hot.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.450
- You didn't happen to get
us backstage passes, did you?

31:09.450 --> 31:12.550
- No, the 33rd row was
the best I could do.

31:12.550 --> 31:16.110
- That's cool. I'll take
them any way I can get them.

31:16.110 --> 31:18.519
- Hey guys, who's getting hungry?

31:18.519 --> 31:19.436
- [All] Me!

31:21.244 --> 31:23.911
(gentle music)

31:56.240 --> 31:59.117
- You're a sinner and you know it.

31:59.117 --> 32:01.543
You don't follow what's in here.

32:03.230 --> 32:05.433
You have man on man sex.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.673
Abortions.

32:08.730 --> 32:09.883
You kill babies.

32:10.780 --> 32:12.633
You do drugs and alcohol.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.183
You vote for the wrong side.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.283
That's what you do.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.203
Sacrifice.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.860
Rainbows.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.013
Serpents.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.550
Are these things we need?

32:29.550 --> 32:31.748
- What is he talking about?
- Or things we just want?

32:31.748 --> 32:34.148
- I can't believe they
play this in restaurants.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.003
- You're a sinner and you know it.

32:38.003 --> 32:38.836
- You're a sinner

32:38.836 --> 32:39.753
and you know it.
- Because you don't follow

32:39.753 --> 32:41.323
- I know.
- what's in here.

32:42.470 --> 32:43.570
- Well, according to the internet,

32:43.570 --> 32:45.530
everything here's supposed to be amazing.

32:45.530 --> 32:48.060
- I know, I love places like this.

32:48.060 --> 32:49.490
- Small town charm, you know.
- These are things

32:49.490 --> 32:51.713
that are only going to hurt you.

32:51.713 --> 32:52.580
'Cause you're a sinner.

32:52.580 --> 32:54.530
- Don't even tell me.
- Mm-hmm.

32:54.530 --> 32:57.040
Mr. Smith himself.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.640
- I thought you were done with Nick.

32:58.640 --> 33:02.723
- I was, but we've just been
together for so long, you know.

33:03.710 --> 33:05.510
- What do they even want this time?

33:05.510 --> 33:07.090
- He's been after me all day

33:07.090 --> 33:08.580
to go out tonight for my birthday.

33:08.580 --> 33:11.110
But I said I had plans with the girls

33:11.110 --> 33:13.303
and he's been texting me all day.

33:14.990 --> 33:18.507
- [Preacher] Why do you
think that these are sins?

33:18.507 --> 33:22.523
These are people who should be cast out.

33:22.523 --> 33:24.273
Don't you understand?

33:25.590 --> 33:26.568
I don't think...

33:26.568 --> 33:28.218
- Is that what you want to drink?

33:29.450 --> 33:31.280
- I'll have a diet cola.

33:31.280 --> 33:32.980
I'll have a regular cola.

33:32.980 --> 33:34.360
- I'll have a diet as well.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.010
- Can I just have water?
- Sure.

33:37.460 --> 33:39.380
- [Preacher] I'm just being
(indistinct) from sin.

33:39.380 --> 33:42.300
- Guys, she scared the shit out of me.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.780
- Well online said the food was great

33:43.780 --> 33:45.830
but they didn't say
anything about the service.

33:45.830 --> 33:47.070
- Well maybe I'll hop online

33:47.070 --> 33:48.693
and give them a little feedback.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.210
- Oh man, look at all these choices.

33:55.210 --> 33:57.400
Biscuits and gravy is calling my name,

33:57.400 --> 33:59.800
but I think I'm actually gonna get

33:59.800 --> 34:01.310
a ham and cheese sandwich.

34:01.310 --> 34:03.814
- Biscuits and gravy at this hour?

34:03.814 --> 34:04.840
Gross.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.210
- Hey, she's a big girl.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.530
She can order what she wants.

34:08.530 --> 34:11.332
- I think I'm getting a corn dog.

34:11.332 --> 34:14.332
(preacher rambling)

34:17.949 --> 34:21.272
- [Preacher] If you can tell me

34:21.272 --> 34:25.052
what's truly wrong with this world...

34:25.052 --> 34:27.796
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:27.796 --> 34:30.658
- Thanks.
- You gotta sacrifice.

34:30.658 --> 34:32.480
- Thank you.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.920
- Do you guys know what you'd like to eat?

34:35.920 --> 34:38.060
- Um, yes, I'm gonna have

34:38.060 --> 34:40.230
the ham and cheese sandwich

34:40.230 --> 34:43.240
with beer-battered fries, please.

34:43.240 --> 34:46.440
- I'll have a cheeseburger
with onion rings.

34:46.440 --> 34:47.720
- What do you want on your burger?

34:47.720 --> 34:49.695
- Ah, ketchup and mustard.

34:49.695 --> 34:51.021
(preacher rambling)

34:51.021 --> 34:53.612
- I'll have the chicken sandwich
with beer-battered fries.

34:53.612 --> 34:55.153
- Bread or a roll?

34:55.153 --> 34:55.986
- Bread.

34:57.800 --> 35:02.800
- Can I have a corn dog and a side of

35:06.790 --> 35:07.663
mushrooms?

35:08.535 --> 35:09.368
- You got it.

35:12.697 --> 35:15.697
(preacher rambles)

35:24.096 --> 35:25.378
- Guys, there's this frame over there

35:25.378 --> 35:27.520
of this couple that says
customer of the month.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.070
I wonder what that's all about.

35:31.460 --> 35:33.580
- Hey, it's my birthday.

35:33.580 --> 35:36.100
Can I be the customer of the month today?

35:36.100 --> 35:37.330
- No.

35:37.330 --> 35:40.530
- So how do you become
customer of the month?

35:40.530 --> 35:42.750
- Whoever comes in the most
during the month previous

35:42.750 --> 35:44.256
is customer of the month.

35:44.256 --> 35:46.000
Graham and Emma are in
here almost every day,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.804
having tea and biscuits for breakfast.

35:48.804 --> 35:50.839
- Ooh, all right.

35:50.839 --> 35:53.756
(preacher rambles)

35:55.208 --> 35:57.625
(all laugh)

36:02.190 --> 36:03.880
- Why did you bring that with you?

36:03.880 --> 36:05.754
- Because it's a real umbrella.

36:05.754 --> 36:07.970
(all laugh)

36:07.970 --> 36:08.803
- [Preacher] You're
gonna go straight to hell

36:08.803 --> 36:10.200
at this point.
- Yeah,

36:10.200 --> 36:11.033
- And you'll deserve it.
- Maddie.

36:11.033 --> 36:12.178
You're gonna go straight to hell.

36:12.178 --> 36:13.280
(all laugh)

36:13.280 --> 36:17.160
- I'm really going to hell if
you can't have even one drink.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.433
- Right, we were just at the strip club.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.299
- What brings you girls to town today?

36:26.299 --> 36:28.290
- Oh, just going to a concert.

36:28.290 --> 36:29.460
- Concert?

36:29.460 --> 36:31.600
There's nothing going on around here.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.480
- It's in Salem.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.590
You see, we're all going
together for her birthday.

36:35.590 --> 36:37.400
- Oh, which way are you headed?

36:37.400 --> 36:40.310
- Um, North 33.

36:40.310 --> 36:42.100
About two hours away from here.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.050
- Well, whatever you do, you
make sure you stay on 33.

36:45.050 --> 36:46.410
Don't take any shortcuts

36:46.410 --> 36:48.660
and don't go on School House Road.

36:48.660 --> 36:50.960
You don't wanna end up there. Trust me.

36:50.960 --> 36:51.950
Enjoy your meal.

36:51.950 --> 36:54.200
- [Preacher] His house, you
don't follow the rules...

36:54.200 --> 36:55.869
- What was that all about?

36:55.869 --> 36:57.137
- I don't know.

36:57.137 --> 36:58.839
(preacher rambles)

36:58.839 --> 37:01.884
(ketchup squirts)

37:01.884 --> 37:03.365
- Hey guys. Mm.

37:03.365 --> 37:05.698
(all laugh)

37:07.512 --> 37:08.345
- Funny.

37:10.450 --> 37:11.343
- [Preacher] That's a sin.

37:13.385 --> 37:14.323
Your life is...

37:14.323 --> 37:16.593
- That was a really good home-cooked meal.

37:17.430 --> 37:21.920
- Now all I need is a tall glass of vodka.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.673
- That's the last thing you need.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.680
- It feels like we've been
waiting for this check forever.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.460
- No wonder, she's all over
that guy in the corner.

37:30.460 --> 37:33.020
- [Waitress] Pay attention to me.

37:33.020 --> 37:34.830
- Um, excuse me?

37:34.830 --> 37:36.923
Could we please have our check?

37:38.346 --> 37:41.263
(preacher rambles)

37:43.958 --> 37:44.791
- Thanks.

37:54.719 --> 37:55.820
- Now remember what I said.

37:55.820 --> 37:57.920
You guys wanna stay off School House Road.

37:59.067 --> 37:59.900
- Thanks.

38:01.660 --> 38:02.900
- Well, we better get going.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.470
I'm not going to miss Marshall
singing his love songs

38:05.470 --> 38:06.463
without a shirt on.

38:07.301 --> 38:09.009
- I know he's so dreamy.

38:09.009 --> 38:11.676
(ominous music)

38:13.495 --> 38:16.328
(crickets chirp)

38:21.660 --> 38:24.320
- Well there's still some
travel time left in the trip.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.310
We might as well play a
game of truth or dare.

38:27.310 --> 38:29.760
- What? How are we gonna
do dares in the car?

38:29.760 --> 38:32.810
- Okay then. Truth, truth.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.443
- I don't know about that guys.

38:35.583 --> 38:37.596
- Why, do you have something to hide?

38:37.596 --> 38:38.470
- Ha, ha.

38:38.470 --> 38:40.713
We all know you have nothing to hide.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.470
Well, who's gonna go first?

38:46.470 --> 38:47.870
- Oh, me, me.

38:47.870 --> 38:49.940
- Okay, Piper. You can go first.

38:49.940 --> 38:51.920
- Piper, have you ever smoked weed?

38:51.920 --> 38:54.510
- (scoffs) Who hasn't?

38:54.510 --> 38:58.910
- Uh-oh, somebody better
call Rehab Anonymous.

38:58.910 --> 39:02.350
- It's Alcoholics Anonymous, genius.

39:02.350 --> 39:05.270
- Oh, okay. Act like you never did.

39:05.270 --> 39:06.830
- Okay. Okay.

39:06.830 --> 39:08.310
Who's next?

39:08.310 --> 39:09.273
- Me, do me.

39:10.190 --> 39:11.610
- Okay, Lilly.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.263
Have you ever stolen a
book from the library?

39:15.270 --> 39:18.620
- Why would I do that when
I can rent them for free?

39:18.620 --> 39:21.620
- I don't know what kind of
twisted book fantasies you have.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.960
- Good Lord, Skylar. All right.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.450
It's your turn.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.980
- Okay. Hit me.

39:26.980 --> 39:29.470
- How many people have you slept with?

39:29.470 --> 39:33.590
- Well, there was Cameron from last night,

39:33.590 --> 39:38.517
Joshua from last week and
Kyle from this morning.

39:38.517 --> 39:40.790
(chuckles)
(scoffs)

39:40.790 --> 39:41.623
What?

39:42.460 --> 39:45.050
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, me.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.900
- Okay, so we all know
you've been crushing

39:46.900 --> 39:48.710
on that boy from the supermarket.

39:48.710 --> 39:50.407
How far have you went with him?

39:50.407 --> 39:52.670
- (sighs) Could we ask something else?

39:52.670 --> 39:54.860
- No. That's your question.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.783
- I haven't even gone on a date with him.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.763
(gentle music)

40:39.140 --> 40:40.770
- Any signs of life?

40:40.770 --> 40:43.200
- Yeah, really. Aren't we gonna be late?

40:43.200 --> 40:44.700
- Well, I really can't drive any faster

40:44.700 --> 40:46.844
with the tires that I have.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.427
(gentle music)

41:07.414 --> 41:09.654
(car sputters)

41:09.654 --> 41:10.487
Oh no.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.084
- Are you fucking kidding me?

41:13.084 --> 41:15.751
(car sputters)

41:25.830 --> 41:27.253
- What, what's going on?

41:28.760 --> 41:30.670
- Stop it already.
- Hey, I'm not

41:30.670 --> 41:31.600
fucking around this time.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.551
We're having car trouble.

41:33.551 --> 41:35.690
- (sighs) You've got to be joking, right?

41:35.690 --> 41:36.563
- I wish.

41:37.819 --> 41:40.210
- And when's the last time
you put oil on this thing?

41:40.210 --> 41:41.910
- Literally yesterday.

41:41.910 --> 41:43.420
- Oh, so you can change your oil,

41:43.420 --> 41:45.103
but you can't change your tires?

41:46.120 --> 41:47.533
- So now what do we do?

41:49.720 --> 41:50.820
- Well, I got nothing.

41:52.180 --> 41:53.093
- Me, either.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.800
- Guys. This is serious.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.020
We're in the middle of nowhere,

41:58.020 --> 42:01.060
we have no cell service and we
haven't passed a gas station

42:01.060 --> 42:03.770
or anything in like how long?

42:03.770 --> 42:06.260
- Good Lord. What a way to wake up.

42:06.260 --> 42:08.280
Can we at least roll down
the windows or something?

42:08.280 --> 42:09.820
Get some fresh air.

42:09.820 --> 42:11.266
- Yeah, here.

42:11.266 --> 42:14.494
(window rolls down)

42:14.494 --> 42:17.244
(insects chirp)

42:18.430 --> 42:19.761
- Guys, I have to pee

42:19.761 --> 42:21.560
- (scoffs) Skylar, right now?

42:21.560 --> 42:23.010
Really?
- I'm sorry.

42:23.010 --> 42:26.010
My bladder works overtime when
I'm nervous and when I drink.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.280
- Okay. Just be careful.

42:28.280 --> 42:29.933
- Okay. Thanks.

42:47.432 --> 42:48.721
(buckle jangles)

42:48.721 --> 42:51.156
(zipper unzips)

42:51.156 --> 42:53.989
(urine trickles)

43:18.720 --> 43:20.820
Guys, you will not
believe what I just found.

43:20.820 --> 43:22.050
There's a building up there.

43:22.050 --> 43:23.500
- A what?

43:23.500 --> 43:25.230
- What type of building?
Did you see anyone?

43:25.230 --> 43:26.500
Any lights?

43:26.500 --> 43:28.540
- It's looks like an old school,

43:28.540 --> 43:30.730
but not lights that I saw.

43:30.730 --> 43:31.780
- What are we waiting for?

43:31.780 --> 43:33.770
Let's get out of here.

43:33.770 --> 43:36.170
- Well, it looks like our only option.

43:36.170 --> 43:38.800
- Well, yeah, but I'm kind of scared.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.610
- Yeah, I get that, but
someone might be up there

43:40.610 --> 43:41.580
to help us with the car.

43:41.580 --> 43:43.193
- Yeah. Come on, Pipes.

43:44.699 --> 43:47.363
- (sighs) Okay. Let's go.

43:49.108 --> 43:54.108
(ominous music)
(wind whistles)

44:13.072 --> 44:15.040
(water splashes)

44:15.040 --> 44:15.873
- Fuck!

44:15.873 --> 44:20.801
(ominous music)
(wind whistles)

44:23.441 --> 44:25.750
- It looks like an old school.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.130
- Fuck.
- What?

44:27.130 --> 44:29.327
- That crazy at the restaurant,
she wrote on our bill,

44:29.327 --> 44:32.290
"Do not go down Schoolhouse Road."

44:32.290 --> 44:34.540
Guessing we made a wrong turn.

44:34.540 --> 44:36.380
- Oh my God.

44:36.380 --> 44:38.340
- Well, we can always make the best of it.

44:38.340 --> 44:39.590
It's getting dark soon.

44:39.590 --> 44:41.693
We're gonna have to walk
for help in the morning.

44:43.973 --> 44:45.741
Well, let's get walking.

44:45.741 --> 44:48.408
(wind whistles)

44:55.959 --> 44:58.626
(ominous music)

45:14.449 --> 45:17.116
(wind whistles)

45:21.513 --> 45:24.096
(door creaks)

45:33.263 --> 45:36.550
Well, it certainly looks
like school's not in session.

45:36.550 --> 45:39.360
- No shit. I'm not sure
if I should laugh or cry.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.940
- I know, right?

45:40.940 --> 45:42.010
- I'm just glad we're inside.

45:42.010 --> 45:43.903
I could not be outside all day.

45:45.270 --> 45:47.090
- Hey, birthday girl.

45:47.090 --> 45:48.563
Why don't you go first?

45:56.500 --> 45:59.370
- When you think the
last person was in here?

45:59.370 --> 46:00.460
- Mm, from the look of it,

46:00.460 --> 46:02.893
I'd say I have no fucking clue.

46:20.959 --> 46:23.542
(water drips)

46:27.000 --> 46:29.273
- Well, does anybody have
to go to the bathroom?

46:29.273 --> 46:31.133
- Geez, I wish I would've known.

46:32.020 --> 46:34.440
- By the looks of it, looks
like it's been a while

46:34.440 --> 46:37.890
since the cleaning lady graced
the rooms of this place.

46:44.386 --> 46:45.940
- Where do you think they go?

46:45.940 --> 46:47.560
- How do you think I know?

46:47.560 --> 46:49.871
- Well, they probably go upstairs.

46:49.871 --> 46:50.920
(scoffs)
We're not gonna

46:50.920 --> 46:52.520
get anywhere just standing here.

47:05.500 --> 47:07.937
(loud clatter)
(all gasp)

47:07.937 --> 47:09.768
What the hell was that?

47:09.768 --> 47:12.163
- I'm not sure about this exploring thing.

47:13.530 --> 47:16.145
- I'm sure that the
building's just settling.

47:16.145 --> 47:20.228
- Shouldn't a place this
old have settled by now?

47:30.651 --> 47:32.843
(ominous music)

47:32.843 --> 47:34.577
I don't think we should keep looking.

47:34.577 --> 47:36.453
- (scoffs) Don't be such a pussy.

47:36.453 --> 47:39.120
(ominous music)

47:46.272 --> 47:48.770
(loud bang)
What the fuck was that?

47:48.770 --> 47:50.800
- Maybe we should just go back to the car.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.650
- And what? Get attacked
by bear in broad daylight?

47:53.650 --> 47:56.400
- Well, if we stay here,
we might be dead too.

47:56.400 --> 47:57.430
- It's fine.

47:57.430 --> 47:58.530
Let's just keep going.

47:59.814 --> 48:02.564
(ominous music)

48:13.060 --> 48:14.373
- Hey, wait up guys.

48:24.312 --> 48:26.180
- Do you guys know those
sounds we just heard?

48:26.180 --> 48:27.640
They remind me a lot of the sounds

48:27.640 --> 48:30.005
I used to hear at my grandma's
house when I was little.

48:30.005 --> 48:33.003
- What, did your grandparents
live in a haunted school too?

48:33.910 --> 48:35.470
- Funny, no.

48:35.470 --> 48:36.580
But when I was little
and I'd spend the night,

48:36.580 --> 48:39.430
I'd hear these sounds
all the time at night.

48:39.430 --> 48:41.830
And she explained to me that
they came from the pipes

48:41.830 --> 48:43.740
from the furnace in the basement.

48:43.740 --> 48:46.260
- What, do you think
this place has a furnace?

48:46.260 --> 48:47.960
- I mean, probably.

48:47.960 --> 48:51.090
So that's probably where
the noises are coming from.

48:51.090 --> 48:53.160
Do you wanna go check it out?

48:53.160 --> 48:55.610
- Well, maybe two of us should
stay up here and walk around

48:55.610 --> 48:58.003
and the other two check the basement area.

48:59.080 --> 49:00.710
- I don't know why someone always suggests

49:00.710 --> 49:03.019
to split up at the dumbest time.

49:03.019 --> 49:04.810
(ominous music)

49:04.810 --> 49:07.630
- Lilly, do you wanna come
with me to the basement?

49:07.630 --> 49:09.673
Lilly? Hello?

49:11.591 --> 49:13.183
- Oh, yeah, that's fine.

49:15.472 --> 49:16.786
- Good luck, guys.

49:16.786 --> 49:19.453
(ominous music)

49:25.458 --> 49:27.625
Lilly, what are you doing?

49:30.205 --> 49:32.356
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

49:32.356 --> 49:34.606
I just feel a little weird.

49:35.863 --> 49:37.570
- I hope that world famous diner

49:37.570 --> 49:39.402
didn't give you food poisoning.

49:39.402 --> 49:40.782
- You think?

49:40.782 --> 49:42.021
- All right, kiddo.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.771
(ominous music)

49:55.093 --> 49:59.270
Some birthday surprise
this turned out to be, huh?

49:59.270 --> 50:01.140
- I mean, there's no way that any of us

50:01.140 --> 50:02.871
could have known this was gonna happen.

50:02.871 --> 50:05.010
- I guess it's just the luck of the draw.

50:05.010 --> 50:07.314
And poor Piper.

50:07.314 --> 50:09.664
(sighs) You know, I wanted
to see that concert.

50:10.586 --> 50:12.236
I guess there's always next year.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.090
There's no way we're
getting out of here tonight.

50:15.090 --> 50:15.990
What do you think?

50:17.900 --> 50:18.872
Hey!

50:18.872 --> 50:19.900
(snaps fingers)

50:19.900 --> 50:22.632
Hey, what are you doing?

50:22.632 --> 50:25.450
- Ah, yeah, uh, I don't know.

50:27.563 --> 50:30.230
- What the hell is wrong with you?

50:30.230 --> 50:31.400
- It's nothing, I'm just stressed out

50:31.400 --> 50:33.520
about this whole situation.

50:33.520 --> 50:34.920
- Okay. I was just worried.

50:34.920 --> 50:37.090
You really had me
freaked out for a second.

50:37.090 --> 50:39.130
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry.

50:39.130 --> 50:40.920
- Okay. Let's keep going.

50:40.920 --> 50:42.060
We have to find the furnace.

50:42.060 --> 50:43.366
It's gonna be a long, cold night.

50:43.366 --> 50:46.116
(wind whistles)

50:48.320 --> 50:50.250
- I'm sorry your birthday
turned out this way.

50:50.250 --> 50:52.965
- Oh, it's okay. At least I'm
here with my best friends.

50:52.965 --> 50:53.798
- Aw.

50:56.070 --> 50:58.830
- I really hope the girls are
finding that furnace okay.

50:58.830 --> 51:00.110
- Yeah, me too, I really wanna know

51:00.110 --> 51:01.823
where those noises are coming from.

51:02.740 --> 51:05.440
- Hey, look, another set of stairs.

51:05.440 --> 51:07.560
- Hmm, this building
does not look that tall

51:07.560 --> 51:08.750
from the outside.

51:08.750 --> 51:10.210
- Do you wanna take 'em?

51:10.210 --> 51:13.050
- I mean, we don't know
how far the others got.

51:13.050 --> 51:14.460
We probably should have got a plan

51:14.460 --> 51:15.821
to meet up with them later.

51:15.821 --> 51:18.140
- Well, it's a little too late for that.

51:18.140 --> 51:20.443
- No doubt. Well, let's give them a try.

51:21.289 --> 51:24.039
(ominous music)

51:31.717 --> 51:34.384
- Ooh, look at this small space.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.538
Oh my God.
- What?

51:36.538 --> 51:37.778
- Look what I found.

51:37.778 --> 51:40.350
(ominous music)

51:40.350 --> 51:41.700
- What the fuck?

51:41.700 --> 51:43.160
- How the hell did this get here?

51:43.160 --> 51:44.403
- I have no idea.

51:45.340 --> 51:46.260
- Do you think we should show Lilly?

51:46.260 --> 51:48.660
You know how much she loves books.

51:48.660 --> 51:51.200
- Hell no. She's been
acting all sickly and weird.

51:51.200 --> 51:54.220
The last thing she needs is
to worry about another book.

51:54.220 --> 51:55.053
- You're right.

51:56.020 --> 51:56.853
(book thuds)
Maybe I shouldn't

51:56.853 --> 51:58.010
even touched it.

51:58.010 --> 51:59.190
- I don't think touching it will have

51:59.190 --> 52:00.230
any negative side effects,

52:00.230 --> 52:02.180
but it should definitely just stay there.

52:02.180 --> 52:03.740
- For sure, and we're not going

52:03.740 --> 52:05.860
to tell the other two we found it either.

52:05.860 --> 52:07.575
- Right, I agree.

52:07.575 --> 52:10.492
(furnace whirring)

52:13.352 --> 52:14.670
- Hmm.
- It sounds like

52:14.670 --> 52:16.530
I can hear a furnace.

52:16.530 --> 52:18.860
- Yeah. Maybe it's already running.

52:18.860 --> 52:21.450
- That's probably why the
lights and everything are on.

52:21.450 --> 52:23.670
- That's true. So we'll get warm soon.

52:23.670 --> 52:24.785
- Yeah.

52:24.785 --> 52:26.773
It's so gross in here.

52:28.370 --> 52:30.910
- When do you think this place was built?

52:30.910 --> 52:33.556
- I don't know. Probably the 1700's.

52:33.556 --> 52:34.740
- (chuckles) That's true.

52:34.740 --> 52:37.150
Can you imagine going to school here?

52:37.150 --> 52:39.560
- Yeah, I don't even know
what you would learn about.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.396
What's history before history?

52:41.396 --> 52:43.020
(both chuckle)

52:43.020 --> 52:44.220
- Since we already found the furnace,

52:44.220 --> 52:46.200
maybe we should go find the girls.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.320
- Yeah, we should probably
start looking for 'em soon.

52:48.320 --> 52:51.204
It might take a while with
how big this place is.

52:51.204 --> 52:52.430
I feel like we're going in circles

52:52.430 --> 52:54.830
and it's starting to make
me feel a little sick.

52:56.460 --> 52:58.084
- Let's go.

52:58.084 --> 52:59.009
(body thuds)

52:59.009 --> 53:00.883
Oh, my fucking God.

53:02.090 --> 53:04.830
Found the coal for the furnace.

53:04.830 --> 53:06.429
- Hey.

53:06.429 --> 53:08.230
- Hey, hey, hey, what?

53:08.230 --> 53:09.713
I'm covered in shit here.

53:12.640 --> 53:15.150
- I'm gonna go get some help.

53:15.150 --> 53:16.840
I need my jacket.

53:16.840 --> 53:18.530
- Help? I don't need help.

53:18.530 --> 53:19.740
Where are you going?

53:19.740 --> 53:21.910
We need to stick together.

53:21.910 --> 53:22.743
Oh!

53:24.101 --> 53:26.850
Oh, this is my good outfit!

53:26.850 --> 53:29.600
Where am I supposed to get
cleaned up in a place like this?

53:29.600 --> 53:31.090
Lilly?

53:31.090 --> 53:31.943
Lilly?

53:38.949 --> 53:41.116
What the hell's back here?

54:14.520 --> 54:15.717
No fucking way.

54:20.084 --> 54:21.898
(water sprays)

54:21.898 --> 54:23.934
I can't believe this shit works.

54:23.934 --> 54:25.737
I feel so fucking dirty.

54:25.737 --> 54:28.154
(soft music)

55:59.069 --> 56:01.652
(water sprays)

56:03.099 --> 56:05.599
(water drips)

56:17.501 --> 56:18.831
(sighs)

56:18.831 --> 56:20.806
(intense music)

56:20.806 --> 56:21.833
Lilly!

56:21.833 --> 56:26.500
(snarls)
(flesh tears)

56:32.207 --> 56:34.294
(snarls)

56:34.294 --> 56:36.565
(flesh tears)

56:36.565 --> 56:39.232
(intense music)

56:49.840 --> 56:52.590
(ominous music)

57:05.659 --> 57:06.492
- Hello?

57:07.802 --> 57:09.052
Can I help you?

57:15.128 --> 57:17.878
Hey, um, what are you doing here?

57:19.005 --> 57:20.922
(ominous music)

57:20.922 --> 57:23.589
(intense music)

57:43.032 --> 57:45.115
(groans)

57:48.634 --> 57:50.884
(snarling)

57:59.313 --> 58:01.790
(screams)
(flesh squelches)

58:01.790 --> 58:03.873
(growls)

58:04.844 --> 58:09.844
(chomping)
(flesh squishes)

58:16.680 --> 58:19.033
- Oh my God. This place goes on forever.

58:19.900 --> 58:22.260
- I know it's like a fucking labyrinth.

58:22.260 --> 58:23.140
- Don't say that.

58:23.140 --> 58:24.600
That reminds me of the one movie

58:24.600 --> 58:26.750
where that guy chases the kid with the ax

58:26.750 --> 58:28.730
in the maze in the snow.

58:28.730 --> 58:31.398
(scoffs)

58:31.398 --> 58:33.550
Well, since you brought
up the size of this place,

58:33.550 --> 58:35.610
I was thinking maybe we should just stay

58:35.610 --> 58:36.543
in one place for right now.

58:36.543 --> 58:38.610
We don't have the slightest clue

58:38.610 --> 58:40.570
where Lilly and Skylar are.

58:40.570 --> 58:42.720
In case they pass through.

58:42.720 --> 58:43.930
- I know, believe me, I know.

58:43.930 --> 58:45.450
I've been thinking about that.

58:45.450 --> 58:47.037
- So what do you wanna do?

58:47.037 --> 58:48.200
- What do I wanna do?

58:48.200 --> 58:50.440
I wanna get a huge cheeseburger

58:50.440 --> 58:51.810
and then get a foot massage

58:51.810 --> 58:53.970
and then watch "Dark Shade Creek."

58:53.970 --> 58:55.860
That movie scares the shit out of me.

58:55.860 --> 58:57.370
- I know, right?

58:57.370 --> 58:58.640
I watched that last Halloween

58:58.640 --> 59:00.880
on the "Horror Movie Marathon."

59:00.880 --> 59:02.360
- Oh, I love Halloween.

59:02.360 --> 59:03.690
This kind of feels like Halloween,

59:03.690 --> 59:05.860
except we're getting more of the tricks

59:05.860 --> 59:07.183
rather than the treats.

59:07.183 --> 59:09.933
(ominous music)

59:27.331 --> 59:31.081
- Hmm, this GPS tracker
took me right to her.

59:31.960 --> 59:32.793
Where the hell is this?

59:32.793 --> 59:34.530
I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere.

59:36.463 --> 59:39.213
(ominous music)

59:43.452 --> 59:45.863
Well looky what we have here.

59:57.400 --> 59:58.650
I knew I'd find her here.

1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:10.825
Where the hell are they at?

1:00:10.825 --> 1:00:13.370
(ominous music)

1:00:13.370 --> 1:00:14.203
Piper?

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:27.560
What the hell's a school
doing all the way out here?

1:00:28.998 --> 1:00:31.996
It's probably where the
Illuminati have their orgies.

1:00:31.996 --> 1:00:34.663
(ominous music)

1:00:43.944 --> 1:00:46.444
(door creaks)

1:01:06.290 --> 1:01:07.233
Girls?

1:01:12.100 --> 1:01:13.550
Piper, I know you're in here.

1:01:18.548 --> 1:01:21.215
(ominous music)

1:01:24.363 --> 1:01:26.362
(intense music)

1:01:26.362 --> 1:01:28.677
- (sighs) I have to pee so bad.

1:01:29.766 --> 1:01:30.930
- Really, Maddie?

1:01:30.930 --> 1:01:31.790
Right now?

1:01:31.790 --> 1:01:34.334
- Well when you gotta go, you gotta go.

1:01:34.334 --> 1:01:36.240
(sighs)

1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:39.590
Plus I kind of overdid it
today with the sports drinks.

1:01:39.590 --> 1:01:41.960
I was so hungover I'm
from drinking last night.

1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:43.670
- I don't need to hear that kind of shit.

1:01:43.670 --> 1:01:45.030
You're how old? You should be able

1:01:45.030 --> 1:01:46.323
to handle yourself by now.

1:01:46.323 --> 1:01:48.030
- I don't need your motherly lectures,

1:01:48.030 --> 1:01:50.060
I just need a restroom.

1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:52.670
- Well, what are we gonna do
if the girls come through?

1:01:52.670 --> 1:01:55.340
I thought the deal was that
we were gonna stay in one spot

1:01:55.340 --> 1:01:56.750
so we wouldn't miss them.

1:01:56.750 --> 1:01:58.810
- Well would you rather stay here?

1:01:58.810 --> 1:02:01.230
- No freaking way am I staying here alone

1:02:01.230 --> 1:02:03.070
in this hell hole.
- Well then I suggest

1:02:03.070 --> 1:02:03.979
you follow me.

1:02:03.979 --> 1:02:06.896
(thunder rumbles)

1:02:19.779 --> 1:02:21.255
- I don't remember any of this.

1:02:21.255 --> 1:02:23.210
Are you sure we're going the right way?

1:02:23.210 --> 1:02:25.367
- Yeah, it's right up here.

1:02:25.367 --> 1:02:27.700
- We should just look
downstairs for a bathroom.

1:02:27.700 --> 1:02:29.649
This is like walking in circles.

1:02:29.649 --> 1:02:32.312
(ominous music)

1:02:32.312 --> 1:02:33.990
(floor creaks)

1:02:33.990 --> 1:02:35.157
- Ah...
- What?

1:02:36.250 --> 1:02:37.364
- Is that Lilly?

1:02:37.364 --> 1:02:39.599
(ominous music)

1:02:39.599 --> 1:02:42.182
(floor creaks)

1:02:52.165 --> 1:02:54.915
(intense music)

1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:00.200
Lilly, what the hell are you doing?

1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:01.487
Where's Skylar?

1:03:01.487 --> 1:03:04.154
(ominous music)

1:03:11.710 --> 1:03:14.127
(clattering)

1:03:19.540 --> 1:03:22.540
(lightning strikes)

1:03:28.601 --> 1:03:31.268
(intense music)

1:03:33.518 --> 1:03:34.764
(screams)

1:03:34.764 --> 1:03:37.431
(ominous music)

1:03:49.092 --> 1:03:51.842
(footsteps thud)

1:04:03.463 --> 1:04:05.799
(footsteps thud)

1:04:05.799 --> 1:04:07.083
- Skylar!

1:04:07.083 --> 1:04:07.916
Help me!

1:04:07.916 --> 1:04:10.583
(ominous music)

1:04:11.594 --> 1:04:12.766
Skylar!

1:04:12.766 --> 1:04:13.599
Skylar!

1:04:13.599 --> 1:04:16.266
(ominous music)

1:04:24.900 --> 1:04:27.612
(sobs)

1:04:27.612 --> 1:04:30.966
- Maddie, please don't run away.

1:04:30.966 --> 1:04:33.591
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1:04:33.591 --> 1:04:35.367
Maddie, I don't feel so good.

1:04:35.367 --> 1:04:39.826
(sobs) Can you help me, please?

1:04:39.826 --> 1:04:41.076
Maddie, please!

1:04:42.214 --> 1:04:44.131
(sobs)

1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:50.140
- Lilly, what's gotten into you?

1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:51.973
What were you doing with that ax?

1:04:51.973 --> 1:04:52.927
(sobs)

1:04:52.927 --> 1:04:55.667
Where's Skylar and Piper?

1:05:01.190 --> 1:05:03.290
- Have you ever been in a rainbow, Maddie?

1:05:05.020 --> 1:05:05.963
I have.

1:05:07.210 --> 1:05:11.343
They're black inside
and that's where I am,

1:05:12.860 --> 1:05:14.177
in the blackness.

1:05:17.159 --> 1:05:18.909
In the black rainbow.

1:05:21.216 --> 1:05:23.883
(intense music)

1:05:48.654 --> 1:05:50.904
(whimpers)

1:05:53.497 --> 1:05:54.330
(neck snaps)

1:05:54.330 --> 1:05:57.368
(body thuds)

1:05:57.368 --> 1:06:00.035
(ominous music)

1:06:09.430 --> 1:06:12.263
(creepy chanting)

1:06:28.020 --> 1:06:31.020
(heavy metal music)

1:08:17.909 --> 1:08:20.992
(distorted chanting)
