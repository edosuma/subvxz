WEBVTT

01:18.328 --> 01:19.658
Where you from?

01:19.872 --> 01:22.082
I'm from Holland, and this is like...

01:22.833 --> 01:25.003
Ten hours for me.
It's, like, across the world.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.840
I came here for this audition.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.507
I told all my boys at home I'm coming
to funk in front of Michael onstage.

01:30.716 --> 01:34.046
I'm just gonna dance for him.
I don't care if I make it or nothing.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.014
Thank you, Michael. I'm excited.

01:36.221 --> 01:40.351
You've inspired everything in my life.
My energy.

01:40.559 --> 01:41.849
You're why I dance.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.190
I remember being a little girl
and watching "Thriller" with my mom...

01:45.397 --> 01:47.977
and thinking that was
the coolest thing in the world.

01:48.192 --> 01:51.652
I go to sleep and just wake up,
and the first thing I do is not even eat.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.702
I just start playing your music...

01:53.864 --> 01:56.784
and start just dancing
and moonwalking on a rug.

01:56.992 --> 02:00.412
I was like, "What I would give
to be onstage with you."

02:00.621 --> 02:04.621
And the fact that I get to do that
is amazing, so...

02:05.292 --> 02:07.752
I'm from Australia...

02:11.423 --> 02:15.763
And I got word of your audition two
days before it was about to happen...

02:15.969 --> 02:18.759
and I was on the next flight over.

02:19.056 --> 02:23.096
It begins. This is the beginning.
I'm not even onstage yet.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.060
Like, I can't even imagine
what's gonna happen backstage...

02:26.271 --> 02:29.481
- that first show in London.
- I'm looking even farther ahead.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.901
I don't even know what I wanna do
after this because this is Michael.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.900
I wanted to dance,
you know what I mean?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.783
And that inspiration came from,
you know, you.

02:37.991 --> 02:42.251
And you've inspired me and given me
a reason to want to inspire others.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.916
Life is hard, right?

02:47.084 --> 02:50.424
I've kind of been searching for
something to shake me up a little bit...

02:50.629 --> 02:55.679
and give me a kind of a meaning,
to believe in something.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.926
And this is it.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.160
So we open the show, as you know,
with all the lights down.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.867
We're gonna create a spectacular
opening with pyrotechnics.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.039
And we want some sizzles
and some cracks and some pops.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.709
We have our video that is called
"Glimpses and Flashes."

03:31.211 --> 03:32.751
And that's where Light Man...

03:32.921 --> 03:35.761
comes out on the gantry,
floating above the stage...

03:35.966 --> 03:41.046
and he'll just be dazzling
in video information.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.597
And piece by piece by piece by piece...

03:46.810 --> 03:49.310
MJ is revealed, until he jumps out...

03:49.521 --> 03:53.321
and on Michael's command,
we begin.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.439
You know I'm gonna
want that more, right?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.438
It's funkier.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.320
I'm not feeling that part enough.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.122
As in running next to him.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.954
- It's not there.
- Okay, it should be.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.121
It should be. I know, it's all for love.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.169
- It's coming there.
- We'll get it there.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.728
Jackson's ETA is 15 minutes.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.242
Michael Jackson last performed
live right here in London...

06:44.446 --> 06:46.776
at the 2006 World Music Awards.

06:46.990 --> 06:50.410
Michael Jackson's here.
Go straight onstage.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.164
This is it!

06:53.163 --> 06:54.163
Yeah!

06:54.539 --> 07:01.549
This is it. This is it.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.420
I love you.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.760
We love you!

07:10.514 --> 07:15.944
I'll be performing the songs
my fans wanna hear.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.943
This is really it.
This is the final curtain call.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.822
Okay? And see you in July.

09:56.596 --> 10:00.636
Good. Great. Good to see all of you.
Thank you for being here.

10:00.892 --> 10:04.352
The idea was get the big fish from all
over and put them in the same pond.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.859
The dancers in
a Michael Jackson show...

10:12.028 --> 10:14.278
are an extension
of Michael Jackson.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.989
They are an extension of the man.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.660
Everything is bigger
and more intense in his world.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.370
First cut, thank you.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.799
Next group. Ladies, brava.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.546
Lean, gorgeous, hot.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.683
Dancers that can rock it.
But if you don't have that goo...

10:41.891 --> 10:44.771
that ooze coming out of you,
not gonna get the job.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.906
She's the one.

11:02.203 --> 11:08.793
And the Michael Jackson principal
dancers for This Is It are:

11:24.184 --> 11:26.604
Guys, those go over here.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.734
Hey, guys?
Those go over here, actually.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.824
Truss moving.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.204
Quite the eventful day
because we got to be toasted.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.083
There's elevator speed
and toaster speed.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.498
Part of this, guys,
is anticipating the stop.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.128
Keep your shoulders square,
keep your center...

11:51.336 --> 11:54.706
and just get right down into
a nice, good squat position like that...

11:54.964 --> 11:56.474
and you're gonna come up and-

11:56.674 --> 11:59.134
- You feel that initial-?
- Yeah, I do.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.974
Yeah, that's the adrenaline, baby.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.533
We're at Culver Studios,
shooting green screen.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.082
We're gonna do "The Drill"
into "Cadence"...

15:12.287 --> 15:13.967
into "They Don't Really
Care About Us."

15:14.163 --> 15:17.213
It's gonna be really cool because
they're gonna multiply the guys.

15:17.417 --> 15:22.337
So our existing 11 guys
are gonna become 1100 guys...

15:22.547 --> 15:24.257
and it'll be really, really cool.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.875
So we're kind of excited.
And Michael's coming today.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.263
- There's the man. The man is here.
- There's Michael.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.768
So that we can give you this:
a million people.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.886
Michael, do you like this, first of all?

15:37.103 --> 15:40.983
Yeah, that's a cool move, a cool move,
but it spreads out too much to the end.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.690
So we can just stop it
whenever you hit the space bar.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.241
You can go to infinity.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.073
Yeah. As though
there's no more than...

15:47.238 --> 15:52.078
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?
Or maybe just your nine dancers?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.485
- Ten.
- Ten. Great.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.632
What is that?

16:02.503 --> 16:04.553
One more time. Six, seven, eight...

18:41.496 --> 18:44.996
In what will go down in history...

18:45.208 --> 18:51.418
as the greatest demonstration
for freedom in the history of our nation.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.846
Hold for applause, hold for applause.

19:46.060 --> 19:49.100
Slow umbrella fade out.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.492
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Let's just go for it.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.342
You sound great, MJ.
You sound great.

21:00.343 --> 21:03.013
Bam, something right there.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.854
We're seconds away, Mike.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.113
- Rolling.
- Rolling.

25:24.899 --> 25:26.519
And Gilda singing.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.789
Bravo!

25:49.465 --> 25:50.795
What's he doing here?

26:04.021 --> 26:06.191
And cut. That was a good one.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.818
Let's cut.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.065
- Okay, Bruce?
- Yes, sir?

26:09.318 --> 26:11.438
Rehearsed, and Michael was great.
We can do this.

26:11.654 --> 26:12.654
- Ready to shoot?
- Yup.

26:12.863 --> 26:16.453
- Okay, guys, let's shoot this.
- Here we go, ready. We are...

26:16.659 --> 26:18.159
- rolling.
- Action.

26:28.712 --> 26:32.012
What do you want me to do?
Count three like they do in the movies?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.557
Guys, that's the cue.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.074
I'm sorry, are we misunderstanding
something here?

26:51.277 --> 26:53.527
- No, we're not misunderstanding.
- We're sizzling.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.067
- He's sizzling.
- I'm sizzling.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.241
He's waiting for my point,
it's coming.

26:57.449 --> 27:02.619
Michael, I was telling them to start
when you turn toward the audience.

27:02.871 --> 27:07.001
Oh, no, I wanna turn first,
face the audience with nothing.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.419
- Okay.
- And then when he gets my cue...

27:09.628 --> 27:11.298
- then we go.
- The only thing is...

27:11.505 --> 27:15.875
how will you see the video change
from the marquee to the city?

27:16.260 --> 27:18.760
I gotta feel that.
I'll feel it, the screen behind me.

27:18.971 --> 27:24.811
All right. Now this is all sizzle, sizzle,
sizzle. It says "Smooth Criminal."

27:24.977 --> 27:29.227
The audience is going wild.
The camera slowly starts to move...

27:29.398 --> 27:31.728
over the marquee.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.512
Pretty good... Pretty good.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.685
You're gonna put that in?

32:25.944 --> 32:28.744
It's really cool for me
as a musical director...

32:28.947 --> 32:31.067
because I need the artist
to be hands-on...

32:31.241 --> 32:34.661
and MJ is always hands-on
with everything he does.

32:34.828 --> 32:37.498
He knows all of his records.
He knows all of his tempos.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.084
He knows all of his keys
of songs.

32:40.334 --> 32:42.844
Just a little drag,
a little bit more behind the beat.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.705
Yeah. It's not the right sound.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.710
Like you're dragging yourself
out of bed.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.303
Imagine this is the right sound.
Check this.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.557
Don't change so soon, though.

32:57.768 --> 33:01.268
Don't wanna change over so soon yet.
See, you're going:

33:16.161 --> 33:17.871
Don't do that one.
Don't do that one.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.040
- Don't do that one yet?
- No, no.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.788
It should be simpler.

33:32.761 --> 33:34.391
Yeah.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.095
We'll get the sound,
we'll get the sound.

33:39.309 --> 33:41.439
We'll get the sound
but that's not till tomorrow.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.937
We gotta do a sound check
tomorrow night.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.267
That's what we need to do.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.570
And don't start unless
you do a sound check.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.526
I know, that's why we doing it.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.398
We need you to do the sound check...

33:51.613 --> 33:53.953
because can't nobody hear
what you need to hear.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.157
Some people might
not wanna have that bass-

33:56.368 --> 33:57.988
I want it the way I wrote it. I mean-

33:58.203 --> 34:00.203
Like the audience hears it.

34:00.497 --> 34:03.327
So whatever the record's doing,
that's how I want it to sound.

34:03.542 --> 34:07.292
That's what it's gonna sound like, but
you gotta get closer to what you want.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.672
Then if you wanna hear
a little more booty...

34:09.880 --> 34:11.880
on something else,
know what I mean?

34:12.092 --> 34:14.512
Only you can say that.
You know what I'm saying?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.469
A little more booty.

34:16.679 --> 34:17.969
That's funny.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.641
But you knew what I meant though too.

34:20.851 --> 34:23.061
I know exactly what you meant.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.561
One more time from the top.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.540
Try to get the same sound.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.763
Good sound on that. Good sound.

35:00.182 --> 35:01.602
No, no, not yet, Prince.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.060
No. You gotta-

35:03.351 --> 35:05.641
You gotta let it simmer.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.734
It's got a moment
where it has to simmer.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.359
- That's right.
- You're not letting it simmer.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.529
Just bathe in the moonlight. You
have to let it simmer a bit, you know?

35:15.405 --> 35:19.365
All right, Prince?
We're gonna add two bars after the:

35:19.618 --> 35:21.538
Or at least a bar.

35:22.871 --> 35:27.041
Yeah. MJ, check it from the top again.
See what we got, simmer-wise.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.460
One, two, three, four.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.048
I gotta cue that. I gotta cue that.

37:02.262 --> 37:05.312
- That shouldn't trigger on its own.
- That's a special on our girl.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.515
That can't trigger on its own.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.556
I gotta cue that.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.359
So you gotta watch me
for that growl, okay?

39:19.024 --> 39:20.614
One more time.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.447
That's why we rehearse.

39:25.655 --> 39:28.695
It's okay, it's okay.
Right here on this one.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.662
They wanted us to take
those eight out so-

39:34.873 --> 39:37.373
It's okay, it's okay, no.
It was a little too soon.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.625
- Yeah, I agree, Michael.
- Yeah.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.674
- I think let's add them back.
- Just leave it.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.841
You don't feel totally nourished by it,
you know?

39:46.051 --> 39:48.761
MJ, we'll also have a fan there,
right there in the center.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.640
I'm trying to hear you.
Say it again?

39:50.847 --> 39:53.807
There'll be a fan,
right there off the stage for you.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.017
Boom, right there.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.647
Okay, watching Michael.

41:06.589 --> 41:10.509
Once again, ladies and gentlemen,
the world's most fabulous group:

41:10.718 --> 41:12.338
The Jackson 5.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.257
Everybody clap your hands.
Come on!

42:37.055 --> 42:38.925
You guys, I gotta tell you this.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.930
When I'm trying to hear
and it feels like...

42:41.100 --> 42:42.940
somebody's fist is
pushed into my ear...

42:43.144 --> 42:45.104
it's really very difficult.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.113
I know you mean well, so, but it's...

42:47.315 --> 42:50.975
I'm trying to adjust to the ear,
the inner ears, okay?

42:51.194 --> 42:53.534
With the love, with the love. L-O-V-E.

42:53.738 --> 42:56.198
- Michael.
- This is not easy though.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.827
Michael, one more time.
I couldn't hear you, sir.

42:58.993 --> 43:02.503
The inner ears are very difficult for me
when you're raised...

43:02.705 --> 43:07.535
to use just your real own,
you know, aural-Auditory ears.

43:07.919 --> 43:11.669
Now it feels like somebody's fist,
just their fist, is shoved into your ear.

43:11.881 --> 43:14.931
- Okay.
- I'm trying to hear and I can't.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.644
So I'm adjusting to the situation.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.555
Right. Michael, is there anything
they can give you now...

43:20.765 --> 43:24.935
in your ears to make it better
in terms of volume or mix?

43:27.272 --> 43:29.062
If we could just bring it down
a little bit.

43:29.232 --> 43:31.652
Bring it down a little bit, please.

43:32.527 --> 43:35.107
Anything else, Michael?
You wanna hear more of anything?

43:35.363 --> 43:37.363
You wanna hear more voice,
wanna hear more-?

43:37.573 --> 43:39.533
- No.
- Okay, Michael, after the next song...

43:39.742 --> 43:42.492
if it hasn't adjusted to your liking,
please let us know?

43:42.704 --> 43:43.874
- For sure.
- Thank you.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.370
Would you like to pick it up from...?

43:46.541 --> 43:49.501
- "Stop! The Love You Save."
- "Stop! The Love You Save."

44:50.772 --> 44:52.562
God bless you.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.128
Everybody!

47:21.839 --> 47:25.929
I'll say, "Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon...

47:26.135 --> 47:30.255
Tito, Randy, I love you.

47:31.724 --> 47:35.314
Joseph and Katherine,
God bless you. I love you."

47:45.863 --> 47:49.533
Just trying to conserve my throat,
please, so understand.

48:28.072 --> 48:30.912
- And blackout.
- We'll make it cleaner at the back.

48:31.075 --> 48:35.365
So you wanna get rid of the bad
specials, those profiles coming in.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.410
There's a lot going on. The dancers...

48:37.665 --> 48:40.245
we do maintenance with them
two to three times a week.

48:40.459 --> 48:44.049
We do Pilates and stretching and
ballet, and they have physical therapy.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.205
You know,
just keeping everybody together.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.755
I saw you, you were going like this,
what is this?

48:48.968 --> 48:50.298
That's Russian. This is Russian.

48:50.511 --> 48:52.511
So Baryshnikov does it like this...

48:52.680 --> 48:54.930
and you guys are doing like this.
Same thing.

48:55.433 --> 48:57.813
- Good.
- One more time.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.556
But we're straight up
and down now, right?

49:00.771 --> 49:03.321
I don't think it's anything
except hand moving.

49:03.524 --> 49:06.114
I think that's smoother,
you know what I mean?

49:06.277 --> 49:08.187
I mean, I have nothing to move.

49:09.739 --> 49:11.199
Dancers, music.

50:17.973 --> 50:20.143
Oh, my gosh.

50:23.354 --> 50:26.694
All right, "I Just Can't Stop
Loving You." Judith.

50:26.899 --> 50:28.149
Let me know when you're ready.

50:28.401 --> 50:34.411
A mi amor eres tú

50:34.615 --> 50:39.905
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me dé lo que das tú

50:41.747 --> 50:44.327
A mi amor eres tú

50:45.584 --> 50:48.254
Do it for Ortega.

50:48.838 --> 50:50.458
- Ortega.
- Here we go.

50:50.715 --> 50:53.045
For his people.

50:54.427 --> 50:57.257
One, two, three.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.352
More echo in here?

56:15.080 --> 56:19.710
Now, don't make me sing out
when I shouldn't be singing out.

56:19.918 --> 56:24.258
I'm warming-I'm trying to warm up
my voice for this moment.

56:24.465 --> 56:27.755
Why do you do this to me?
I shouldn't be singing right now.

56:28.719 --> 56:32.809
- No. No, no.
- You better sing!

56:33.974 --> 56:36.644
I'm warming up to the moment.

56:36.810 --> 56:41.230
- But you just can't help it, MJ.
- No, but, I shouldn't. I really shouldn't.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.270
- Yeah, but you felt it.
- No, no.

56:43.484 --> 56:45.574
But you can allow yourself
that one time.

56:45.778 --> 56:47.068
I can't do that.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.489
But you're fine to do it.
I gotta save my voice.

56:49.698 --> 56:53.408
That ending was just like
the smelliest ending of all the versions.

56:53.952 --> 56:55.792
Band, it's just this.

56:56.830 --> 56:59.000
This is what it is.

57:06.924 --> 57:09.514
What day is it?
What time is it?

57:09.718 --> 57:12.848
We're down to the wire. We're
like halfway through our film shoot...

57:13.097 --> 57:16.767
for all of our incredible
new film content for This Is It.

57:17.643 --> 57:22.733
Today we are filming new segments
for "Thriller," 3-D.

57:36.995 --> 57:38.825
- Do I still have on my 3-D glasses?
- Yes.

57:39.039 --> 57:40.369
Oh, good.

57:40.833 --> 57:43.173
I think I look great in these glasses.

57:43.752 --> 57:45.252
Do I look as old as I feel?

57:45.838 --> 57:49.758
Guys, please step away if you're not
in the shot. Photographers, everybody.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.677
Clear the set now for the crew.

57:51.885 --> 57:53.965
- Rolling!
- Here we go.

57:54.805 --> 57:55.845
Action.

57:59.017 --> 58:00.807
This guy should be getting out soon.

58:02.396 --> 58:04.726
- You guys, be aware of the camera.
- Look up to it.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.278
There's gonna be light on him.
No light on him now.

58:07.484 --> 58:08.824
Give the information to him.

58:09.027 --> 58:11.147
Gravedigger, right into the camera.
Put your-

58:11.363 --> 58:14.413
There it is. Right into it, right in there.
That's it, keep going.

58:14.658 --> 58:15.778
- Right there.
- That's it.

58:16.076 --> 58:18.866
Right into the camera.
Reach your hands out in front of you.

58:19.079 --> 58:21.869
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- That's it, beautiful!

58:22.833 --> 58:26.383
Keep coming. Yeah, right into the lens.
I'm in the center of the camera.

58:26.587 --> 58:27.837
There you go.

58:28.338 --> 58:34.048
Now, go out. Go out. Good. And cut.
It's brilliant. Thank you, everybody.

58:40.726 --> 58:43.686
We call these the dead brides
and the dead grooms.

58:44.062 --> 58:48.612
And there'll be a parade of them
moving through the aisles in "Thriller."

59:19.640 --> 59:22.600
Darkness falls across the land

59:23.352 --> 59:26.232
The midnight hour is close at hand

59:26.605 --> 59:29.765
Creatures crawl in search of blood

59:30.067 --> 59:32.987
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

59:33.862 --> 59:36.662
And whosoever shall be found

59:36.865 --> 59:39.655
Without the soul for getting down

59:40.494 --> 59:44.164
Must stand and face the hounds of hell

59:44.373 --> 59:47.503
And rot inside a corpse's shell

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:28.737
The demons squeal in sheer delight

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:33.674
It's you they spy, so plump, so right

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.837
For though the groove is hard to beat

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:39.955
Yet still you stand with frozen feet

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:43.183
You try to run, you try to scream

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:46.848
But no more sun you'll ever see

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:49.807
For evil reaches from the crypt

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:53.098
To crush you in its icy grip

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.905
Make sure that there's somebody
waiting for Michael there...

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:32.868
with a flashlight and everything.
Great.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:50.183
Now, you know,
could we do that times 10?

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:51.799
Absolutely!

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.096
Okay, so next is the fire screen.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.388
We're gonna show you
some chase sequences.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:16.294
Rock 'n' roll!

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.598
Today was all about...

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:36.522
testing the chandelier
and bed props for the show...

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:39.515
with our aerialists
and pole-dancing experts.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.269
It's all about
checking dimension...

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:46.149
- widths, pipe, how things work.
- Building props with people on it...

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.529
is a big responsibility
and a lot of fun...

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:52.488
because we have to design things
around the human body.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.950
This is the first time in the history
we've worked with Michael...

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:02.171
for the past 25 years that
we are including lighted elements...

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.875
in his "Billie Jean" costume.

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:06.634
The cut of the stones,
the refraction of the light...

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:10.258
as we're applying, you almost
need sunglasses, just the reflection.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.227
We're bringing things
into his performance...

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:16.305
where they haven't been developed.
It's just being developed for Michael.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.564
I'm working with scientists
in the Netherlands...

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.348
with people in California,
working with Swarovski.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:25.401
Always trying to push the boundaries
because that's what Michael's about.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.567
Now, is this working this evening?

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.910
Without running the number,
if Michael would like to...

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:37.697
just to give him a little ride so that
he feels his new cherry picker out.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.411
From the top of "Beat It."

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:42.539
- You wanna do it with music already?
- Yeah.

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:44.881
Can I just give you a ride first?

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:46.415
- Sure. If you want.
- Okay.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.916
Yeah. Just for safety. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Michael.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.723
- Sure. Sure.
- Daredevil MJ.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.716
- I trust in you.
- Thank you.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:58.219
Just for safety. Thank you.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.521
Stand by, guys.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.602
You've been there before.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:09.024
MJ, this is just at mid-height.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.944
It goes much higher than this.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.355
This is the low height.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:17.452
Why would you say that to me?
You know better.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.947
See, why did you say that to him?

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.080
He's teasing me. That's why.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.620
He know I wants to go higher.

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.038
God bless you, Kenny.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:28.542
Hi.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:32.133
Yeah, yeah.
Are the fans working on this?

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.630
It's great.

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:35.432
Michael, please hold on.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:38.345
- Thank you.
- It's very nice.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.595
- Yeah? Is it smooth?
- Yeah.

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:45.139
Great. This is monumental,
Michael's back on the cherry picker.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.305
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.280
- We love you, Michael.
- Love you too.

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:48.163
Okay, that's where you want it?
When we come up-

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:49.776
What we're doing is...

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:51.659
We're doing it for the height.

01:12:52.452 --> 01:12:54.042
I'm gonna take off the jacket...

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:57.745
and kick it, and beat it, and beat it
and we're gonna burn it.

01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:00.706
The jacket's gonna be too hot.
It's gonna be on fire.

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.288
I just wanted to know
when that last one was.

01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:05.302
That's the one, I was pointing to it.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.800
I was pointing that to you.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.894
I got you.
You don't have to do it again.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.064
We can. Do it again.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.477
Here it is right here,
just do me the last one.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.811
Come on the one before it.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.770
Let's go on to C. One before.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:12.447
And let it burn, and the lights out!

01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:14.284
Lights out.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.662
Lights out! Let it burn!

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:19.039
We're on a 10-minute break.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.543
I'm just so happy.
This is a dream come true.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:26.342
When MJ comes in the room
to rehearse with us...

01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:31.174
his presence is just amazing. It's
pretty, pretty cool. Really, really cool.

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:37.135
Thank you.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:42.728
Michael is the epitome of one of
the great entertainers of our time.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:46.185
Performing with Michael
has just been a thrill.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:50.192
I've been a Michael Jackson fan
since he was 8.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:53.703
It's like a lifelong dream for me
to actually work with Michael.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:56.406
I've worked with
a lot of great, great artists...

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.989
but I consider this,
like, really a pinnacle.

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:00.913
Michael's a perfectionist.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.540
You don't find that in pop musicians.
You can't fool Michael.

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.542
You have to come in
knowing the record.

01:15:06.794 --> 01:15:08.714
Then, hopefully,
finding a middle ground...

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.921
to embellish it
to make it even better.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.880
He's just an icon of performance.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:17.931
His talent runs so deep in creativity.
And he draws from a deeper emotion...

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:20.427
than anybody else
I've ever seen or worked with.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.194
Right here, right here, right here.

01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:26.814
Okay, no second verse.
Sorry. Okay, sorry, sorry.

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:30.935
That was a mistake, there is no second
verse. Sorry about that, you guys.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:34.360
First verse, then right to the bridge,
okay?

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:36.702
- Let's do it one more time.
- Sure.

01:15:36.908 --> 01:15:39.408
- Wanna go down then come back up?
- One more time.

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:42.449
- This is why we have rehearsal.
- There you go.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:39.511
So we'll run this way.

01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:36.629
When they stop, you have to just keep-
Just hit your highest note.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:39.005
It's time for you to shine.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.545
And hit a high, long one.

01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:47.814
I mean, way up there.

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:51.307
It's your time to shine.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.059
We'll be right there with you.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:09.664
It's remarkable. It's some genius stuff
going on over here, man.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:12.753
He is the king.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.540
And he's a good guy too.
He's real humble.

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.631
You know. And he knows his music.

01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:21.457
What more can you ask for? Because
I'm searching for that flavor too.

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:45.261
Look at that. I think it's beautiful.

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:47.508
Show him the second one.

01:20:47.718 --> 01:20:50.138
- It'll come rolling out at us, right?
- Yes.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:52.846
- All golden. Look at this.
- It'll be floating so much.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.387
I love her. I love the light.

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:57.642
- God, and the lighting's great.
- Yeah. You got it.

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:09.453
I respect the secrets
and magic of nature.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:13.908
That's why it makes me so angry when
I see these things that are happening.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.791
That every second, I hear,
the size of a football field...

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:18.666
is torn down in the Amazon.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:21.294
I mean, that kind of stuff
really bothers me.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.050
That's why I write these kind of songs,
you know.

01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:28.165
It gives some sense of awareness
and awakening and hope to people.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.762
I love the planet.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:36.100
I love trees. I have this thing for trees,
and the colors and changing of leaves.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:40.438
I love it.
And I respect those kind of things.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:08.368
The value would be greater...

01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:10.525
you let it rumble...

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:14.122
let it stay open,
let it close in silence.

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:21.094
And when that door opens,
you start that piano.

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:27.718
God bless you.

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.466
I really feel that nature
is trying so hard...

01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:35.021
to compensate for man's
mismanagement of the planet.

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:38.687
Because the planet is sick.
Like a fever.

01:28:38.897 --> 01:28:42.067
If we don't fix it now,
it's at the point of no return.

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:45.744
This is our last chance
to fix this problem that we have...

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:48.199
where it's like a runaway train...

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:50.657
and the time has come.
This is it.

01:28:50.867 --> 01:28:52.827
I love you.

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:56.246
That'll be the ending
of this under the words.

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:03.707
People are always saying, "They'll
take care of it. The government'll-

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:08.262
Don't worry. They'll-"
"They" who? It starts with us. It's us.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:10.890
Or else it'll never be done.

01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:17.516
Guys, can I have the lighting crew?

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:19.938
- Travis?
- Yeah!

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:22.768
First of all, Michael will be
coming on from offstage...

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:25.111
and he's got, like, an attaché case.

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:28.447
And right here, Michael,
you call it here.

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:33.203
So now it comes here. So it's a light
that is moving on his command.

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:35.790
- Absolutely.
- Right? Then when he moves forward...

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:37.618
- he's in that light.
- Yeah.

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.079
He's in that light.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:42.291
But I wanna be able to step
into the pool once I'm fully dressed.

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:45.801
So then-So after he does this-
Why don't you do this, Michael?

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:48.418
After you go like this
and you send that down...

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:50.965
a gesture and a pool of light
comes on.

01:29:51.178 --> 01:29:53.468
Now a pool of light comes on
down here...

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:56.472
- wherever his light is...
- Yeah.

01:29:56.683 --> 01:30:02.273
And the pool of light comes on
and now he'll walk into it, center stage.

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:06.981
And now he'll start.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.860
I know.

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:29.775
At least we get a feel of it.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.120
God bless you.

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.130
Church.

01:36:45.008 --> 01:36:47.678
The church of rock 'n' roll.

01:36:49.596 --> 01:36:50.596
I'm a fan.

01:36:50.847 --> 01:36:52.057
God bless you.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:53.523
Get some water.

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:55.885
Water, water...

01:36:58.188 --> 01:37:01.228
I just wanna say as Michael's
creative partner in this venture...

01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:04.399
this has been one of the most
extraordinary experiences...

01:37:04.611 --> 01:37:08.741
of my creative life. I am so proud
and so thrilled and so excited...

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:12.030
and I just wanna thank everybody
for their extraordinary work.

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:15.503
And I'm gonna just give this
to Michael now.

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:18.124
Everybody's doing a great job.

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:22.713
Let's continue
and believe and have faith.

01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:28.051
Give me your all, your endurance,
your patience and your understanding.

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:31.929
But it's an adventure,
it's a great adventure.

01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:34.008
It's nothing to be nervous about.

01:37:34.224 --> 01:37:37.394
They just want wonderful experiences,
they want escapism.

01:37:37.644 --> 01:37:40.354
We wanna take them places
that they've never been before.

01:37:40.563 --> 01:37:43.273
We wanna show them talent
like they've never seen before.

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:44.935
So give your all.

01:37:45.151 --> 01:37:48.531
And I love you all. And we're a family.
Just know that. We're a family.

01:37:48.738 --> 01:37:49.948
- That's right.
- Amen.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:52.068
We're putting love
back into the world...

01:37:52.242 --> 01:37:55.702
to remind the world
that love is important.

01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:59.292
Love is important. To love each other.
We're all one. That's the message.

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:01.121
And take care of the planet.

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:03.092
We have four years to get it right...

01:38:03.253 --> 01:38:05.753
or else it's irreversible,
the damage we've done.

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:10.304
So we have an important message
to give. Okay? It's important.

01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:14.928
But I thank you for your cooperation
so far. Thank you. Big thank you.

01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:19.638
Blessings! Blessings to all.

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:22.061
Michael Jackson!

01:38:30.822 --> 01:38:32.412
Have a beautiful Sunday.

01:38:32.615 --> 01:38:34.985
- Be safe. Stay healthy.
- Energy!

01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:46.000
On three! On three, "Michael."

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:47.674
One, two, three!

01:38:47.839 --> 01:38:49.509
Michael!

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:57.139
What I'd like to do right now is just run,
for a sound check, "Man in the Mirror."

01:38:57.348 --> 01:39:00.018
- Okay.
- And then we'll talk about the ending.

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:02.308
MJ Air.

01:39:03.646 --> 01:39:04.856
Your favorite part.

01:39:05.106 --> 01:39:06.856
Right?

01:39:07.734 --> 01:39:09.824
- They'd love that.
- You have to do it like MJ.

01:39:10.028 --> 01:39:11.028
No, no, no.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:12.529
You know you love that part.

01:39:12.739 --> 01:39:13.739
I love when you...

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:15.485
No, no.

01:39:16.034 --> 01:39:19.754
That's how the stewardesses do it,
I love when they do that.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:21.501
I love it.

01:39:21.748 --> 01:39:25.958
In third grade, the first song
I sang was "Man in the Mirror."

01:39:26.127 --> 01:39:28.707
So it's kind of cool, like,
going from that to this...

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.050
singing it onstage with Michael,
you know.

01:39:31.257 --> 01:39:34.047
So it's just an amazing experience
to be onstage with him.

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:36.392
He's such an amazing artist.

01:49:42.368 --> 01:49:45.248
- There should be a break there.
- Yeah, we gotta work that out.

01:49:45.454 --> 01:49:48.414
- Have it right there, okay?
- Yeah, we gotta work that one out.

01:49:48.666 --> 01:49:51.076
Let me bathe in my own time
when I come back in.

01:49:51.293 --> 01:49:52.673
Yeah, you got it.

01:49:52.878 --> 01:49:56.798
I'm gonna button my shirt
or my jacket or whatever it is.

01:49:57.007 --> 01:50:00.387
I'm gonna look around a little bit,
play with them.

01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:04.471
Snap my fingers maybe, then bam!
