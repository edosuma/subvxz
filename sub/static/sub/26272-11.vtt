WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.004
CLAIRE: The trip was amazing;
it was perfect.

00:04.047 --> 00:05.918
We swam with stingrays.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.790
Randy got a great tan.

00:07.833 --> 00:11.446
And then it rained for two
days, so we got married.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.665
WOMAN :
...taking off shortly.

00:13.709 --> 00:16.755
Yes, Aunt Diana, for real.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.019
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm telling you,

00:19.062 --> 00:20.759
it was meant to be.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.022
Thank you.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.763
I got to go, we're
at our seats.

00:24.807 --> 00:27.549
Yes, I have
lots of pictures.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.072
I'll send pictures.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.987
Okay. Love you, too.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.685
Sounds like that went all right.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.738
Hello?

00:42.781 --> 00:44.044
Mr. Greene.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.784
My boss.

00:45.828 --> 00:48.744
Uh, no, I'm still
out of the country.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.093
Another two days.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.921
Uh, I'm actually
on a plane right now,

00:51.964 --> 00:53.053
getting ready to take off.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.926
Can't you get
Emerson to help you?

00:56.969 --> 00:59.015
You're alone?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.018
Well, like I said,

01:02.062 --> 01:04.586
I'm-I'm on a plane
full of people.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.414
I-I know they don't know
what we're talking about,

01:06.457 --> 01:07.893
but still,
it makes me nervous.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.895
And besides, I don't know
your combination.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.201
I only know mine.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.770
Okay, no, it's fine.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.380
I'm being silly.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.903
Do you have a pencil?

01:17.947 --> 01:19.296
Okay, here goes.

01:20.732 --> 01:22.038
77...

01:22.082 --> 01:23.257
63...

01:23.300 --> 01:25.650
11, 46.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.043
Can you say it back to me?

01:28.827 --> 01:30.829
Exactly.

01:30.873 --> 01:33.354
Nope, no trouble
at all, Mr. Greene.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.008
Oh, and by the way,
when you see me in two days,

01:36.052 --> 01:38.837
I'll have
a new last name.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.448
Uh-huh, I got married.

01:42.319 --> 01:45.105
No, you don't need
to make us a ring.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.933
You, too. Okay.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.066
That was like watching
a foreign film

01:50.110 --> 01:51.111
without the subtitles.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.549
Oh. Poor Mr. Greene.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.551
He needs to sell
the store.

01:56.594 --> 01:57.813
He's too old.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.249
I mean, he can't even
remember his combination

01:59.293 --> 02:02.078
to the safe anymore.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.427
He wants
to make us a ring.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.864
I told you, I have a ring.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.084
Yeah, well, talk is cheap.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.924
Sorry, allergies.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.273
Oh.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.848
Congratulations.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.590
Heard you on the phone.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.244
Oh. Thank you.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.768
Boss wants to
make you a ring, huh?

02:41.073 --> 02:42.118
I'm guessing
you're in jewelry.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.641
Retail?

02:43.685 --> 02:46.862
Yeah, it's not my forever job,
but it pays the rent.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.864
My ex-wife was in jewelry.Oh.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.086
I think she wore
the same perfume you're wearing.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.915
Eau de Bonne Jeunesse?

02:56.959 --> 03:00.092
Y-Yeah. Randy got it for me.

03:00.136 --> 03:03.008
Always made me sneeze.Oh, I'm sorry.

03:03.052 --> 03:06.621
Everything makes me sneeze.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.753
Three more hours
before the sun comes up.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.755
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.583
Okay.
You want to get out
before I settle in?

03:12.627 --> 03:13.976
No, I'm good.

03:14.019 --> 03:17.414
Okay, see you
in the morning, newlywed.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.111
See you in the morning.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.986
CLAIRE:
No. No, no, no.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.335
No.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.555
RANDY: What's the matter?I can't find my phone.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.731
I have all my pictures
on that phone.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.080
Our-our wedding,
our honeymoon.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.473
I have everything on that phone.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.039
Well, it's got to be
here someplace.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.128
I'll call it from my phone.Oh. Is this it?

03:36.172 --> 03:37.304
Oh, my God.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.522
Yes.
It was on the floor.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.395
Yes. Yes, thank you.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.926
♪ Let's stay together...

03:55.365 --> 03:57.237
♪ I...

03:58.542 --> 04:02.938
♪ I'm so in love with you

04:02.981 --> 04:05.462
♪ Whatever you want to do...

04:05.506 --> 04:08.073
Maybe I'm crazy but it feels
like some of you is missing.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.988
Well, I made a pledge
the last time you left,

04:10.032 --> 04:11.294
I wouldn't eat
until you returned.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.600
Well, had I known that,

04:12.643 --> 04:14.384
I would have stayed away
for another six months.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.517
Oh. Hmm.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.825
♪ Make me feel so brand-new...

04:20.869 --> 04:23.219
Don't take this the wrong way,
I'm thrilled that you're here.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.742
But what is this dire emergency

04:24.786 --> 04:26.657
you woke me
out of a dead sleep for?

04:29.181 --> 04:31.183
I just didn't know
who else to call.

04:31.227 --> 04:34.230
I flew in from Texas last night
and I'm staring at

04:34.274 --> 04:37.320
an arraignment
in 20 minutes and...

04:37.364 --> 04:39.844
while I do believe
with all my heart

04:39.888 --> 04:41.150
that you are one of the dumbest

04:41.193 --> 04:44.327
hunks of man that I have ever
had the pleasure

04:44.371 --> 04:46.982
of sharing pleasure with...

04:47.025 --> 04:49.201
I will also concede...

04:49.245 --> 04:51.029
that no one can navigate
a New York City courtroom

04:51.073 --> 04:52.422
better than you.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.556
I feel so cheap when women
just use me for my mind.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.386
Obviously, I'll get you
through the arraignment

04:59.429 --> 05:02.563
but let's start with
who you're representing

05:02.606 --> 05:04.086
and what's the crime?

05:04.129 --> 05:05.609
I'm here for my niece.

05:05.653 --> 05:06.871
What's the charge?

05:06.915 --> 05:09.134
Armed robbery.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.440
In the matter of

05:10.484 --> 05:13.791
The People v. Claire
and Randy Markes...

05:13.835 --> 05:15.402
how do you plead?

05:15.445 --> 05:18.883
Both Claire and Randy Markes
plead not guilty, Your Honor.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.669
Counsel, would you like
to be heard as to bail?

05:21.712 --> 05:23.627
We certainly would, Your Honor.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.890
Your Honor, the People
at this time would ask

05:25.934 --> 05:27.152
that no bail be offered.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.024
On a burglary charge?

05:29.067 --> 05:30.547
The store's owner
is still in the hospital

05:30.591 --> 05:32.680
and the prognosis for
his recovery is not yet clear.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.292
We could be looking at murder
charges in the days to come.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.035
Additionally, the defendants
recently traveled to...

05:40.078 --> 05:42.516
Thailand, Sri Lanka,
and the Maldives,

05:42.559 --> 05:44.474
which doesn't have
an extradition treaty

05:44.518 --> 05:47.129
with the U.S.
It's the People's view

05:47.172 --> 05:49.436
that the defendants represent
a very real flight risk.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.394
Oh, my God.DIANA: Your Honor.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.354
Please. My clients have no
record of previous charges,

05:54.397 --> 05:56.530
no record of
previous arrests.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.706
They don't even have points
on their driver's licenses.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.142
JUDGE FOLEY:
Be that as it may,

06:00.185 --> 06:02.927
the court will accept
the A.D.A.'s recommendations

06:02.971 --> 06:04.581
and deny bail
at this time.

06:07.192 --> 06:10.282
Ask the court officer
to find a place we can
meet with our clients

06:10.326 --> 06:12.372
before they're taken
back to jail.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.199
None of this makes any sense.All right,

06:14.243 --> 06:15.940
well, let's just start
at the beginning, okay?

06:15.984 --> 06:18.682
Now, this is my friend,
Dr. Jason Bull.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.641
He's a legal genius.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.469
But we don't tell
him that to his face

06:22.512 --> 06:25.167
because we don't want to
make his head any bigger.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.690
He'll be assisting us
with the trial

06:26.734 --> 06:28.692
and doing everything
he possibly can

06:28.736 --> 06:32.217
to make sure that we get you out
of here as quickly as we can.

06:33.349 --> 06:37.179
So, both of you will be
representing both of us?

06:38.354 --> 06:39.921
We'll work out
the particulars later

06:39.964 --> 06:44.012
but right now, I'd like
to get Dr. Bull up to speed.

06:44.055 --> 06:47.232
Okay, the store
that Claire works at,

06:47.276 --> 06:50.497
it's a, uh, mom-and-pop
jewelry store in Brooklyn.

06:50.540 --> 06:54.109
It was robbed at gunpoint
two nights ago

06:54.152 --> 06:55.458
at 2:30 in the morning.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.895
Everybody wore masks and gloves

06:57.939 --> 07:00.463
but we have a ton of video.

07:00.507 --> 07:04.162
Unfortunately, the two robbers
very much resemble

07:04.206 --> 07:07.296
both Claire and Randy,
height-wise and weight-wise.

07:07.339 --> 07:10.125
Okay, and what about
this man who was hurt?

07:10.168 --> 07:11.909
The one who's in the hospital?

07:11.953 --> 07:13.433
Mr. Greene.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.957
He's old
and starting to lose it.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.046
Sometimes he forgets
where he is.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.048
Sometimes he forgets who he is.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.267
Apparently, he was
sleeping in his office

07:22.311 --> 07:23.878
when the robbers came in.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.923
The police said
he was pistol-whipped

07:25.967 --> 07:27.490
to within an inch of his life.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.318
Hmm. Okay.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.189
And what convinced
the authorities

07:31.233 --> 07:32.190
you two were involved?

07:32.234 --> 07:33.757
Well, the safe they hit...

07:33.801 --> 07:36.281
keeps track of every time
it's opened and who opened it.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.979
Now, each store manager, they--

07:38.022 --> 07:40.329
and really, there are
only three, including the owner.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.287
They have their own combination.

07:42.331 --> 07:45.334
Hmm. And somehow
the robbers knew to use yours.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.510
Okay.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.338
Let's talk alibi.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.253
What were you two doing
at 2:30 in the morning

07:51.296 --> 07:54.474
when the store was being robbed
and your boss was being beaten?

07:54.517 --> 07:55.736
Well, at 2:30 in
the morning

07:55.779 --> 07:57.346
we were where we
were supposed to be.

07:58.739 --> 08:02.569
At home in
bed together.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.048
I'm Randy, by the way.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.834
BULL: Yeah, it's nice
to meet you, Randy.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.444
And unfortunately,
two codefendants,

08:08.488 --> 08:11.229
two married codefendants
vouching for each other

08:11.273 --> 08:13.536
is not the world's
strongest alibi.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.451
I'm assuming that there's
no one staying with you?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.540
No one called
in the middle of the night?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.761
No. Like we told the
police, it was just us.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.414
Asleep by midnight.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.549
DIANA:
So, can I count on you?

08:26.593 --> 08:27.768
You know, back me up?

08:27.811 --> 08:29.247
Whisper in my ear?

08:29.291 --> 08:32.381
How well do you know
your niece's new husband?

08:32.424 --> 08:34.557
This is the first
time I ever met him.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.646
Ah, and you
love him already.
Mm.

08:36.690 --> 08:37.908
What's this?

08:37.952 --> 08:39.431
Randy's record.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.303
He has a record.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.263
Ah, there's a couple
of juvie convictions.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.656
One for petty theft.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.093
He got in a bar fight
three years ago.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.921
He hit someone in the head
with a guitar.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.357
Is this guy a musician?

08:52.401 --> 08:54.011
Well...

08:54.055 --> 08:55.970
based on this record, he could
be a Supreme Court justice.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.841
I'm here to represent her.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.235
I don't even know him.And that's fine.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.584
They should have
separate representation.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.325
You don't want either one
of them looking back

09:03.368 --> 09:05.153
and thinking that their lawyer
wasn't looking out

09:05.196 --> 09:06.328
for them and only them.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.330
Okay, good.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.679
So he's not my problem.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.682
But he is.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.119
What you don't want is
this guy you don't know

09:15.163 --> 09:17.600
out there on his own with
his own legal team,

09:17.644 --> 09:20.429
his own narrative
that you can't control.You know,

09:20.472 --> 09:22.779
this would be
a much easier conversation

09:22.823 --> 09:24.389
with a drink.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.782
Why don't we do this?

09:25.826 --> 09:28.698
You represent Claire,
my firm will represent Randy.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.005
You'd do that?

09:32.397 --> 09:33.703
Why?

09:33.747 --> 09:35.183
For you.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.228
And because it's smart;
I got a hundred reasons.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.013
Name one.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.405
Well, let's start
with the A.D.A.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.059
First chance he gets,
he's gonna offer

09:42.103 --> 09:43.583
your niece
or her husband a deal.

09:43.626 --> 09:44.801
Divide and conquer.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.368
They're innocent.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.152
Well, at least she is.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.415
Any defense is only as good
as its weakest link.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.678
You let Randy fall
into the clutches

09:51.721 --> 09:53.593
of some public defender
who's juggling

09:53.636 --> 09:54.811
16 other cases...Okay.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.596
Okay, I see where you're going.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.032
Two separate defense teams.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.948
Working together.
You and me.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.254
It's just really important
we're completely transparent

10:03.298 --> 10:05.256
with one another;
we need to send a message

10:05.300 --> 10:07.432
to the A.D.A.
that neither one of us

10:07.476 --> 10:08.825
is gonna sell the other side out

10:08.869 --> 10:10.653
and that there's no point
trying to smear Randy

10:10.697 --> 10:13.090
with 15-year-old charges from
when he was in middle school.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.705
You really are something.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.404
So here's the plan:

10:22.447 --> 10:25.059
I'll provide TAC resources
for both sides.

10:25.102 --> 10:28.323
You represent Claire
and Benny'll represent Randy.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.455
Hmm.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.114
So what are you drinking?

10:38.376 --> 10:39.595
Oh.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.032
I'm sure I'll find something.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.185
How'd it go?I just got off
the phone with him.

11:04.228 --> 11:07.144
He filled me in, e-mailed me
all the relevant work product.

11:07.188 --> 11:11.453
Ah. Well, then, let's do this.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.456
What's the matter?

11:14.499 --> 11:16.588
I don't know.

11:16.632 --> 11:19.069
Something in his voice.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.768
He sounded like the old Bull.Well, we love the old Bull.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.987
Not that old Bull.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.642
Marissa,

11:26.686 --> 11:30.124
he and Diana are old friends.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.300
It's no secret they enjoy
the hell out of each other.

11:32.343 --> 11:36.739
He probably just...
stayed out past his curfew.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.481
Besides...

11:41.396 --> 11:43.659
...he's gonna do
what he's gonna do.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.489
MARISSA:
So, the plan of action

11:47.532 --> 11:50.274
is to request a joint trial
for Claire and Randy.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.537
One jury for both defendants?

11:52.581 --> 11:54.409
That's what he wants.

11:54.452 --> 11:57.368
But wouldn't conventional
wisdom be to split them up?

11:57.412 --> 11:59.457
Well, since Bull and Diana
are so close,

11:59.501 --> 12:01.459
and since the two defendants
are newlyweds,

12:01.503 --> 12:03.984
Bull is throwing out the
conventional wisdom on this one.

12:04.027 --> 12:06.682
He believes the optics are
just too good to ignore.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.380
The jury seeing them together,
it all feeds into the narrative.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.469
Which is...

12:11.513 --> 12:13.558
They just didn't do it.
They couldn't have done it.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.778
Someone is setting them up,
taking advantage of two

12:15.822 --> 12:17.345
sweet young kids
who just got married

12:17.388 --> 12:19.782
and are being wrongly jailed
for something they didn't do.

12:19.826 --> 12:23.786
We'll lean on reasonable doubt,
present character evidence

12:23.830 --> 12:25.701
for both of them,
and then hope, in the meantime,

12:25.745 --> 12:29.705
that the real robbers slip up
and somehow reveal themselves.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.663
Well, I can put in
a call to the FBI.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.361
I've got a friend who can
check on the chatter

12:33.404 --> 12:36.668
of known fences, and pawn shops
that deal in stolen diamonds.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.932
Then I'll head over
to the jewelry store,

12:38.975 --> 12:42.283
talk to the girl's coworkers,
see what they know.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.415
And I should head over to court,
meet our new clients,

12:44.459 --> 12:47.679
say hi to Diana and get ready
for the start of voir dire.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.814
And give me a call if I have
anything I need to worry about

12:51.858 --> 12:54.904
on that other front.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.514
He's fine.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.603
He's a big boy, Marissa.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.439
There she is!

13:08.483 --> 13:10.224
I've been looking all over
for the two of you.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.443
Come here.
Where's the big guy?

13:27.415 --> 13:29.678
Yeah, we've, uh...

13:29.721 --> 13:32.420
really been slammed
at work lately.

13:32.463 --> 13:34.639
I honestly don't know
when the man sleeps.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.032
Right now.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.904
Right.
And last night.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.731
We went out for drinks.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.646
He was on his second one,
and that man looked like

13:41.690 --> 13:44.345
he was about to keel over.Mm.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.695
Last time I was here, it took
two just to prime his pump.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.218
Yeah, well, you know,

13:48.262 --> 13:51.439
the problem is the man
never gets a break.

13:51.482 --> 13:55.486
I think I'm gonna just
slip in there and, uh,

13:55.530 --> 13:57.924
yeah, give him a little nudge.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.414
Did I drift off?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.808
Looks that way.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.028
Diana's waiting for you outside.

14:15.071 --> 14:18.118
Oh, she's something, isn't she?Mm.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.338
Sounds like you had a bit
of a rugged night.

14:21.382 --> 14:25.473
Oh, no, just, uh,
a little out of practice.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.997
Oh. Well, I'm confused.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.651
I didn't know you
needed to practice.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.261
I thought you were retired.

14:31.305 --> 14:34.395
It was "Old Timers' Day."

14:34.438 --> 14:35.918
Felt good to be back
on the field.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.965
Ah, well, I wouldn't want
to deny you that.

14:39.008 --> 14:42.751
But voir dire is calling.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.928
Ah, well,
if voir dire is calling,

14:45.972 --> 14:48.017
we must answer.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.280
It's Claire's combination.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.891
It's Claire's place
of employment.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.110
She's a young married woman
with a musician for a husband,

14:54.154 --> 14:56.069
so of course she needs money.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.679
And that means what?

14:57.722 --> 14:59.768
That means we want jurors
who tend to believe

14:59.811 --> 15:01.857
the simplest explanation
is not always the right one.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.468
You mean like
conspiracy theorists?

15:04.512 --> 15:06.514
No, not necessarily
that radical.

15:06.557 --> 15:10.474
Just people who are willing to
consider alternative narratives.

15:10.518 --> 15:15.784
Show of hands. Area 51.
Proof of aliens?

15:18.091 --> 15:21.921
Or... Area 51. Government hoax?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.531
MARISSA:
I'm confused.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.707
We want to keep the folks who
believe we're being visited

15:25.750 --> 15:28.449
by little green men, or
we want to keep the people

15:28.492 --> 15:29.841
who believe Area 51

15:29.885 --> 15:31.060
is a government hoax?

15:31.104 --> 15:32.409
We keep 'em all for the moment.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.758
They're willing
to believe something

15:33.802 --> 15:34.934
they don't know for certain

15:34.977 --> 15:36.892
and can't really prove.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.807
And then we do our best to try
and get rid of the ones

15:38.850 --> 15:41.984
who didn't raise their hand
for either choice.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.768
Good morning.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.597
I'm afraid I owe you
all an apology.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.208
On your way in,
I picked your pockets

15:48.251 --> 15:49.426
and stole all your wallets.

15:52.908 --> 15:56.694
I noticed that you didn't need
to check your pockets, sir.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.609
No.
And why not?

15:58.653 --> 16:01.786
Because I know there's no way
in the world you took my wallet.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.441
Barry Fletcher.
Of course he's a skeptic.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.226
He works as an actuary
at an insurance company.

16:06.269 --> 16:09.881
A non-believer
and a numbers cruncher.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.145
The defense would ask
the court to thank

16:12.188 --> 16:14.016
and excuse juror number seven.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.497
Juror number 11.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.716
I couldn't help but notice
that you checked.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.502
Your purse, your pockets,
your coat.

16:21.545 --> 16:24.026
Well, I thought maybe you were
just messing with us,

16:24.070 --> 16:26.507
but you can never be
too careful.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.030
Sophia Holmes. Unemployed.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.858
And according to her
credit card statement,

16:29.901 --> 16:32.643
she sees a tarot card reader
at least once a month.

16:32.687 --> 16:35.298
I've died and gone to heaven.

16:35.342 --> 16:38.910
Now, just to be clear,
you needed to be sure.

16:38.954 --> 16:41.087
You had a doubt.
A reasonable doubt.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.436
Sure.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.741
BULL :
Thank you, Benny.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.265
Plant the seed.
Reasonable doubt.

16:45.308 --> 16:48.529
Say it loud, you're unsure
and you're proud.

16:50.792 --> 16:54.056
That is terrific news.
I'll pass it along.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.667
What's terrific news?

16:56.711 --> 16:59.627
I could use some
terrific news.

16:59.670 --> 17:03.326
The store's owner, Mr. Greene,
is recovering quite nicely,

17:03.370 --> 17:05.894
and may even be well enough
to testify tomorrow.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.461
That's excellent.
Mm.

17:07.504 --> 17:08.897
So much for murder charges.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.248
Maybe we could even revisit
the question of bail.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.991
Well, thank you
for dinner, sir.

17:26.523 --> 17:29.787
I can feel your
heart beating.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.051
That's always a good sign.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.360
So tomorrow it starts.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.842
Yup. Tomorrow it starts.

17:40.885 --> 17:44.846
You want to run that
opening statement by me?

17:44.889 --> 17:48.893
No. I want to go dancing.

17:48.937 --> 17:52.027
Excuse me?
Mm.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.335
Once this trial starts,
we're not gonna have any time.

17:55.378 --> 17:58.729
Every night is gonna be about
preparing for the next day.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.036
It's the last night
of summer vacation.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.951
I want to go dancing.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.867
I haven't been dancing
in 15 years.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.087
Well, all the more
reason to go, then.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.049
I will go dancing.
Mm.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.138
And we will go back
to your hotel room.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.706
You're reading my mind.

18:18.749 --> 18:21.404
And then you will read me
your opening statement.

18:21.448 --> 18:25.278
There will be openings.Oh?

18:25.321 --> 18:28.629
There will be statements.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.326
I don't know if
there'll be any reading,

18:30.370 --> 18:33.895
but... then again,
you never know.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.027
Hmm.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.284
I need to go.

20:44.155 --> 20:47.507
Um...
you do understand

20:47.550 --> 20:49.117
what is next on the menu,
don't you?

20:50.684 --> 20:53.600
Um...

20:53.643 --> 20:55.689
I'll explain it to you later.
I just, uh--

20:55.732 --> 20:57.691
I have to--

20:57.734 --> 20:59.214
I've got to get some fresh air.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.914
Uh, who are you and what have
you done with Jason Bull?

21:03.958 --> 21:08.571
I'm so sorry.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.895
First witness for
the prosecution after lunch

21:27.938 --> 21:29.331
is your boss.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.725
Okay. Good.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.336
He must be doing better.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.772
He loves me.

21:35.816 --> 21:38.384
Well, be that as it may,

21:38.427 --> 21:41.212
if the prosecution didn't think
he had something to offer,

21:41.256 --> 21:42.779
they wouldn't be
putting him on the stand.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.694
What could he offer?
We weren't there.

21:44.738 --> 21:48.132
I have no idea.
But let's drill down

21:48.176 --> 21:50.439
on the obvious for a second.
It wasyour combination

21:50.483 --> 21:53.094
that opened the
safe that night.

21:53.137 --> 21:56.532
If it wasn't you, who was it?

21:56.576 --> 21:58.534
Uh, how would I know?

21:58.578 --> 22:00.319
Dr. Bull...Have you ever shared
your combination

22:00.362 --> 22:02.408
with anyone who isn't
authorized to have it?

22:02.451 --> 22:03.670
No.
Is it written
down somewhere

22:03.713 --> 22:05.585
where someone could find?

22:05.628 --> 22:07.891
No.
So you've never told
your combination

22:07.935 --> 22:10.372
to anyone,
never even uttered it out loud?

22:10.416 --> 22:12.374
No.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.333
Yes.

22:16.639 --> 22:20.382
Five days before the robbery,
Mr. Greene called me.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.992
He forgets things.

22:22.036 --> 22:24.647
He forgot his combination,
and I gave him mine.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.475
He forgets things?

22:26.519 --> 22:29.260
Forgets the combination
to his own safe?

22:29.304 --> 22:31.262
Well, he's old.

22:31.306 --> 22:34.004
And I know it kills him
to ask for help.

22:34.048 --> 22:38.661
Well, obviously your boss didn't
rob and pistol-whip himself.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.663
That's the only time
you can recall?

22:40.707 --> 22:42.622
That's the only time
it ever happened.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.019
Uh, we didn't do this.

22:49.063 --> 22:53.067
He knows youdidn't
do anything, honey.

22:55.765 --> 22:59.334
Well, there is one more thing
I want to clear up.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.425
The D.A.'s office sent
these over last night.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.602
Look familiar?

23:06.646 --> 23:08.778
RANDY:
Yeah.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.215
I have one just
like it. Or, I did.

23:11.259 --> 23:12.782
I think I lost it
in Thailand.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.393
BULL: Well,
this was found

23:14.436 --> 23:16.438
outside the jewelry store
the night of the robbery.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.788
Police, at first, didn't think
there was any connection.

23:18.832 --> 23:22.401
Took them a couple days to, uh,
find the camp, and get a list

23:22.444 --> 23:24.054
of the people who were
at the reunion.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.665
Only 200 of these were made.

23:25.708 --> 23:26.622
What are you implying?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.232
Why don't you tell us?

23:28.276 --> 23:29.669
There's nothing to tell.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.672
I was in bed beside my wife
the entire night.

23:32.715 --> 23:36.589
And I haven't seen that hat
since we got back.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.767
Tell them, honey.

23:42.812 --> 23:45.554
I actually don't know
anything about your hat.

23:45.598 --> 23:49.645
No, I mean, tell them I was in
bed with you the whole night.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.867
BULL:
She's already told us that.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.912
No one's implying anything.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.566
We're all in this together.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.614
I was sleeping in my office.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.180
Do you do that often?

24:03.224 --> 24:05.531
GREENE:
It's not something I plan.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.358
Lot of times at night,
I can't sleep.

24:07.402 --> 24:11.711
So when I come in the next day
to work, I'm exhausted.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.801
I close up,
sit down in my office

24:14.844 --> 24:18.761
about 8:00,
do my paperwork,

24:18.805 --> 24:20.807
and end up
conking out in my chair.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.156
So what happened?

24:22.199 --> 24:27.161
Ah. Alarm went off,
2:30 in the morning,

24:27.204 --> 24:29.163
scared the life out of me.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.731
And the only way they can get
through is in the front,

24:31.774 --> 24:32.993
and that's where I went.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.951
And, uh, you encountered
the robbers.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.387
Yes, sir.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.172
Did you get a good look at them?

24:38.215 --> 24:41.567
Not their faces.
They had masks on.

24:41.610 --> 24:45.614
Uh, h-he was kind of tall, uh,

24:45.658 --> 24:48.225
and she was a, uh... a she.

24:48.269 --> 24:49.444
Sort of like

24:49.488 --> 24:51.141
the two defendants,
seated over there?

24:51.185 --> 24:53.753
Objection. Counsel
is testifying.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.320
JUDGE MILLER:
Sustained.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.323
Hi.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.805
M-Mr. Greene?

25:02.849 --> 25:05.895
She's my Clairey.

25:05.939 --> 25:09.029
Works in the store.
She's a lifesaver.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.078
Let's just call
for a verdict right now.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.515
MARISSA:
Easy, big boy.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.690
It ain't over till it's over,

25:17.733 --> 25:19.822
and this one's barely begun.Excuse me.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.824
No one asked you.
If I want to hear the truth,

25:21.868 --> 25:23.870
I'll go out into the hall
and talk to myself.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.654
So you confronted
the robbers.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.264
I sure did.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.484
And the tall one confronted me.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.487
Took his gun and he started
hitting me in the head.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.880
Uh, and then I fell down,

25:33.923 --> 25:36.360
and-and then,
I must've passed out.

25:36.404 --> 25:39.929
Is there
anything else you remember

25:39.973 --> 25:42.715
that happened prior to you
losing consciousness?

25:42.758 --> 25:45.674
One thing.
I heard the woman say something.

25:45.718 --> 25:48.329
CARTER:
What did she say?

25:48.372 --> 25:53.029
She said, "Randy, stop it.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.857
You're killing him."

25:54.901 --> 25:56.685
CARTER: "Randy."

25:56.729 --> 25:59.949
Are you positive that's
what she called him?

25:59.993 --> 26:01.734
Oh, yeah.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.737
100%. Randy.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.527
I am so sorry, Bull.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.007
It's that good, huh?

26:14.050 --> 26:17.184
"Sea of red"
doesn't even get it done.

26:17.227 --> 26:19.229
What did I just tell you
about the truth?

26:34.680 --> 26:35.855
Excuse me.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.596
Could you drop me off first?

26:37.639 --> 26:41.208
Switch seats with me.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.210
Switch seats with me. Come on.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.516
Call me crazy,
but I sense some antagonism

26:45.560 --> 26:48.345
here in the back seat.

26:48.389 --> 26:51.348
"Randy," hmm? Isn't
that your client's name?

26:51.392 --> 26:54.221
Apparently, that was one
of the burglar's names.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.179
Well, thank goodness
all this anger isn't personal.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.268
Ha, well, it's a
little personal.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.443
I can take the subway.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.445
You know, lots of people
are named Randy.

27:01.489 --> 27:04.274
I can attest to that.And we have no way
of knowing if the Randy

27:04.318 --> 27:06.581
Mr. Greene thinks he heard
referred to is our Randy.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.148
Could be
a whole different Randy.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.411
Could even have been
"Andy," or "Sandy."

27:10.454 --> 27:11.804
He makes an excellent point.

27:11.847 --> 27:15.024
Sometimes the people
you think are Randy aren't.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.636
Don't I know it.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.162
I can take the subway.

27:22.205 --> 27:25.774
Benny could cross-examine
Mr. Greene tomorrow morning.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.124
We already know he's forgetful.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.126
It wouldn't be very difficult
to convince the jury

27:30.170 --> 27:32.302
that he is a less than
reliable witness.

27:32.346 --> 27:33.869
My client would have
a serious issue with that,

27:33.913 --> 27:35.088
thank you very much.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.393
She loves Mr. Greene,
and thinks

27:36.437 --> 27:39.266
that he has been through enough.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.877
Excuse me, you can
drop me off right here.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.535
I'll see you in
the morning, Benny.

27:55.195 --> 27:57.893
Seriously, I could
take the subway.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.286
GRANT:
Your scars look good.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.288
Your heart sounds good.

28:01.331 --> 28:04.247
I'm gonna give you
the name of my stylist,

28:04.291 --> 28:07.642
see if he can do something fun
with your unruly chest hair.

28:07.686 --> 28:11.211
But first, why don't you
tell me what spooked you

28:11.254 --> 28:14.301
so bad that you had to see me
at 7:00 in the morning?

28:14.344 --> 28:16.129
You get lightheaded
in the gym?

28:16.172 --> 28:17.521
Short of breath
walking to work?

28:17.565 --> 28:19.306
Actually, I was with a woman
the other night...

28:19.349 --> 28:20.611
Ah, I'm thrilled
for you.

28:20.655 --> 28:24.441
She and I have known each other
for a long time.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.269
And one thing led to another...

28:26.313 --> 28:27.618
And...?And my heart

28:27.662 --> 28:30.752
started to pound.Okay.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.928
Is it supposed to do that?

28:32.972 --> 28:36.279
It depends. How excited were you
to be with this woman?

28:36.323 --> 28:39.239
Does she know
about your history?

28:39.282 --> 28:40.980
What you've been through
this past year?

28:41.023 --> 28:42.285
Your operation was...

28:42.329 --> 28:44.679
last May.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.204
I'm assuming that you've been
in this situation prior to this?

28:50.076 --> 28:52.252
Or... maybe not?

28:52.295 --> 28:56.038
Any particular reason?
I mean, religion, pain

28:56.082 --> 28:57.474
or something
that I should know about?

28:57.518 --> 29:00.782
I've certainly thought about it.

29:00.826 --> 29:04.046
You know, it's not unusual for
men who suffer a cardiac arrest

29:04.090 --> 29:07.354
to shy away from intimacy,

29:07.397 --> 29:10.270
and convince themselves
that in all the excitement,

29:10.313 --> 29:12.446
they might give themselves
another heart attack.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.318
You're saying that
like it's not the case.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.668
You're in better shape now than
in all the time I've known you.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.801
The problem is not
with your heart.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.194
The problem's in your head,

29:21.237 --> 29:24.066
said the heart surgeon
to the head doctor.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.592
You like this woman?
You trust this woman?

29:28.636 --> 29:30.769
Tell her your history.

29:30.812 --> 29:35.338
Tell her what you're feeling,
and if she's still interested,

29:35.382 --> 29:38.559
then you have nothing to fear.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.996
What if you're wrong?

29:41.040 --> 29:45.392
Well, if I'm wrong, you die.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.744
But what a way to go.

29:53.487 --> 29:54.967
BENNY:
We are not welcome.

29:56.446 --> 29:59.536
Diana's client wanted some time
alone with her attorney.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.930
Where's Randy?Guard took him to court.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.627
I've been standing
here waiting for you.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.542
I couldn't help but
sense a little something

30:05.586 --> 30:07.327
in the car last night.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.546
Is our alliance here
starting to fall apart?

30:09.590 --> 30:11.374
I have no idea.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.333
But I'd love to know what
they're talking about in there.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.943
CLAIRE:
Do you remember yesterday,

30:14.987 --> 30:17.380
when Randy said he hadn't seen
his hat since Thailand?

30:17.424 --> 30:19.469
Sure.

30:22.472 --> 30:25.824
He wore it onto the plane home.

30:26.912 --> 30:30.045
So he did have it here
in New York.

30:30.089 --> 30:33.440
I don't know. All I know is that
he wore it onto the plane.

30:33.483 --> 30:36.399
I-I'm guessing he threw it into
his carry-on bag or something.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.227
Do you think
maybe he just forgot?

30:38.271 --> 30:39.663
That's why I'm talking to you,
Aunt Diana.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.361
I don't know what to think.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.406
Okay, honey. Okay...

30:48.411 --> 30:49.717
COURT OFFICER: I need you
both in the courtroom.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.414
The judge is about
to take the bench.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.764
All right.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.418
Are you ready?

30:57.594 --> 31:00.075
Prosecution calls
Jacqueline Stone to the stand.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.079
BENNY:
Uh, objection.

31:04.123 --> 31:08.127
Your Honor, we have no
knowledge of this witness.

31:08.170 --> 31:11.434
Neither did we
until last night.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.741
Witness can testify.
I'll give you time to prepare

31:13.784 --> 31:16.483
for cross-examination.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.920
Who is this woman?
Do you know her?

31:18.964 --> 31:21.575
Ask Randy.
She's my
ex-girlfriend.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.316
Ex-fiancée.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.667
JACQUELINE: I dated him
for almost two years,

31:26.710 --> 31:29.496
and then we decided
to get married.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.801
What happened?

31:30.845 --> 31:33.543
You'd have to ask him.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.720
He texted me, said something
just didn't feel right.

31:36.764 --> 31:39.114
CARTER:
Wow.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.464
You talk to him after that?Not for a long time.

31:41.508 --> 31:43.379
But you heard from him recently?

31:43.423 --> 31:46.382
Yes, uh, he's actually
been calling a lot lately.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.560
MARISSA:
I'm guessing you know

31:50.604 --> 31:52.432
what's going on over here.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.129
BULL: You don't need
to say anything.

31:54.173 --> 31:57.393
I can actually feel the love.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.352
CARTER: Any reason
in particular?

31:59.395 --> 32:01.789
He wanted his
engagement ring back.

32:01.832 --> 32:04.357
He said it was his
grandmother's. I told him that

32:04.400 --> 32:06.533
if he wanted it back,
he could come to my place

32:06.576 --> 32:07.882
one night and pick it up.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.363
See that? Oh ye of little faith.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.800
He wanted the ring back
for Claire.

32:12.843 --> 32:15.411
And did he? Did he come
to your place?

32:15.455 --> 32:18.545
He did, around midnight.

32:20.286 --> 32:22.070
We hung out for a while.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.725
Talked about old times.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.424
Look, I'm not given to panic,

32:28.468 --> 32:30.513
but if she starts testifying
that they slept together,

32:30.557 --> 32:33.516
I need you to call in
a bomb threat.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.083
And then what happened?

32:35.127 --> 32:38.695
He told me that he met someone.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.871
Told me that was why
he wanted the ring back.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.570
I got upset.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.964
I told him he was never
getting it back, and he left.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.924
Your Honor...

32:49.968 --> 32:52.057
Okay. We lived.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.973
Honestly? That was
a whole lot of nothing.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.281
Um...

32:59.325 --> 33:02.458
one last question.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.722
Do you recall
what night this was?

33:05.766 --> 33:07.376
The night Randy came by?

33:07.420 --> 33:09.596
Uh, December 6th.

33:09.639 --> 33:11.641
CARTER:
That's the same night

33:11.685 --> 33:13.034
the jewelry store
was burglarized.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.429
So if the defendants
were to tell the police

33:16.472 --> 33:20.172
that they were home
that night sleeping,

33:20.215 --> 33:22.435
they'd be lying, wouldn't they?

33:22.478 --> 33:24.654
Well, they'd be lying
about Randy, that's for sure.

33:24.698 --> 33:27.005
And if you don't believe me,
you can ask the doorman

33:27.048 --> 33:28.876
at my building.
He let Randy in and out.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.579
No further questions.

33:36.623 --> 33:38.451
Okay, let's just call
for a recess.

33:38.494 --> 33:39.626
That'll give us
enough time to...

33:39.669 --> 33:41.628
Cross-examination,
Your Honor?

33:41.671 --> 33:43.456
Oh, I thought your team
would want time

33:43.499 --> 33:46.067
to prepare for cross,
but by all means.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.636
DIANA:
Just to be clear,

33:49.679 --> 33:52.508
you're testifying that
at the night of the burglary,

33:52.552 --> 33:54.684
you and Mr. Markes
were together.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.687
You and Mr. Markes.

33:57.731 --> 34:01.517
So you don't actually know
the whereabouts of my client,

34:01.561 --> 34:04.694
do you?What is she doing? Objection!

34:04.738 --> 34:07.349
Grounds?

34:10.135 --> 34:13.616
Withdrawn.

34:13.660 --> 34:16.489
What do you know, "backstabbing"
isn't grounds for objection.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.318
You're a woman, aren't you?

34:19.361 --> 34:21.885
Last I checked.

34:21.929 --> 34:24.366
And you're roughly
my client's height and build.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.716
Well, maybe Randy has a type.Maybe.

34:26.760 --> 34:30.807
Or maybe it was you he was with
the night of the burglary.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.200
Excuse me?

34:32.244 --> 34:34.898
Objection, Your Honor.
The witness is not on trial.

34:34.942 --> 34:37.945
Sustained. Jury will ignore
the question.

34:37.988 --> 34:42.341
Withdrawn. No further questions,
Your Honor.

34:52.046 --> 34:53.221
Some team.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.660
Some alliance. Some partnership.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.967
Hey, I didn't call Randy's ex
to the stand.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.839
That was as much of a surprise
to me as it was to you.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.624
So you just figured,
what the hell,

35:04.667 --> 35:07.496
we'll just throw him under
the bus in front of the jury?

35:07.540 --> 35:09.759
You're damn right I did.
That man is a liar.

35:09.803 --> 35:10.673
Excuse me?

35:10.717 --> 35:12.240
He's been lying to us.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.984
He's been lying to me.

35:17.027 --> 35:20.640
You left me in the middle of the
night to go see your ex-fiancée?

35:20.683 --> 35:23.860
For the ring.
I wanted to give you the ring.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.688
But why not tell me?

35:25.732 --> 35:29.039
To protect you.
To protect your feelings.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.737
I didn't want you to be upset.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.696
Okay, good plan.
What about the hat?

35:33.740 --> 35:35.220
What are you talking about?

35:35.263 --> 35:37.787
You told everyone in this room

35:37.831 --> 35:39.789
that you lost your hat
in Thailand,

35:39.833 --> 35:41.356
but you know damn well
that you were

35:41.400 --> 35:42.923
wearing the hat
onto the plane home.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.144
Was I?

35:47.754 --> 35:50.931
Oh. Yeah.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.542
BENNY: So you had it
here in New York?

35:53.586 --> 35:56.241
Could someone have
stolen it from you?

35:56.284 --> 35:58.199
But I didn't have it
here in New York.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.245
I haven't seen it since...

36:02.638 --> 36:04.814
I must've left it
in the overhead bin.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.773
I threw it up there.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.644
I was putting

36:08.688 --> 36:11.517
our bags up there. You were
on the phone with your aunt.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.388
Then you were on the phone
with your boss...

36:13.432 --> 36:14.650
DIANA:
Mr. Greene?

36:14.694 --> 36:17.000
Why were you on the phone
with your boss

36:17.044 --> 36:18.393
while you were
on your honeymoon?

36:18.437 --> 36:20.482
He didn't know it was
going to be a honeymoon.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.745
We didn't know it was
gonna be a honeymoon.

36:22.789 --> 36:25.357
I told you. He forgot
his combination to the safe,

36:25.400 --> 36:26.749
so I gave him mine.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.622
When you say "gave him,"
you texted? You e-mailed?

36:29.665 --> 36:32.059
We were still on the
ground, so I just...

36:32.102 --> 36:33.800
told him over the phone.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.281
Out loud?

36:36.324 --> 36:38.065
BENNY: Boy, I would
love to know

36:38.108 --> 36:39.849
who was sitting around you
when you were on that call.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.938
I know someone who might
be able to help us with that.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.288
See if you can talk
to the judge,

36:43.331 --> 36:44.898
get us a continuance for a day.

36:46.856 --> 36:49.685
Marissa, is
Taylor around?

36:49.729 --> 36:52.122
Yeah, ask her if she can
find a way to access

36:52.166 --> 36:53.863
the manifest from the Thailand

36:53.907 --> 36:55.996
to New York flight that
Randy and Claire were on?

36:56.039 --> 36:57.432
I need names,
addresses,

36:57.476 --> 37:00.653
and final destinations
of everyone seated around them.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.307
Mm-hmm.

37:04.352 --> 37:07.094
Thank you.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.009
You're welcome.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.277
TAYLOR:
He has quite a record.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.366
Breaking and entering, assault.

37:18.410 --> 37:19.889
He seemed so nice.

37:19.933 --> 37:23.632
So you're guessing he heard
the combination, memorized it.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.721
But how did he figure out
where Claire worked?

37:25.765 --> 37:28.376
Did he ever have access
to your phone?

37:30.422 --> 37:34.164
You couldn't find it when we
were getting off the plane.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.776
He must've grabbed it
when I was sleeping

37:36.819 --> 37:38.386
and then kicked it
down the aisle,

37:38.430 --> 37:39.692
so I wouldn't know
it was him.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.041
BENNY:
Grabbed your hat

37:41.084 --> 37:43.826
so he could drop it
at the scene and guarantee

37:43.870 --> 37:45.785
you two would
take the blame.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.527
Now all we have to do
is find him.We're working on it.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.746
Did he tell you anything else
about himself?

37:50.790 --> 37:52.182
Anything at all?

37:52.226 --> 37:54.837
Um, he mentioned
he'd been married.

37:54.881 --> 37:55.838
TAYLOR:
Okay.

37:55.882 --> 37:57.884
Anything else?
CLAIRE: Um...

37:57.927 --> 38:00.539
He didn't like my perfume.
Said he was allergic to it.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.541
What kind of perfume
were you wearing?

38:02.584 --> 38:05.674
BOTH:
Eau du Bonne Jeunesse.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.031
Our man is on the move.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.382
We'll alert the authorities.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.036
Just got word.
He's out of the apartment.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.300
Scotch. Neat.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.175
Cup of coffee, please.

38:33.485 --> 38:34.877
Bless you.

38:34.921 --> 38:38.751
That came out of nowhere.
Uh, excuse me. So sorry.

38:38.794 --> 38:42.189
No need apologize.
In fact,

38:42.232 --> 38:45.105
it's probably my fault.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.327
Eau du Bonne
Jeunesse.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.720
It's a gift
from a friend of yours.

38:51.764 --> 38:55.333
Said she sat next to you on a
plane from Thailand to New York.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.945
Bless you again,
Mr. McCall.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.730
Wait a second,
how do you know my name?

39:01.774 --> 39:04.951
Stephen McCall.
I had to give it to the police

39:04.994 --> 39:06.953
so they could execute
the search warrant.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.999
Search warrant?Mm-hmm.

39:10.043 --> 39:12.567
They've been at your house
for the last ten minutes.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.093
Sounds like they might've
found something. Stolen goods,

39:17.137 --> 39:19.313
that sort of thing.

39:19.357 --> 39:23.012
See that?

39:23.056 --> 39:25.188
They did.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.495
I'd stay in that seat
if I were you.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.236
Finish your drink.

39:29.279 --> 39:32.805
You're not gonna be having
one of those for a long time.

39:32.848 --> 39:36.286
Besides, they already
picked up your accomplice,

39:36.330 --> 39:38.245
your ex-wife.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.073
She told them everything.

39:43.729 --> 39:47.950
That's on me.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.913
Is there any better sound
in the world

39:53.956 --> 39:56.002
than when the judge says
"case dismissed"?

39:56.045 --> 39:57.960
Not when you're representing
the accused

39:58.004 --> 40:01.703
and the accused
is someone you care about.

40:01.747 --> 40:05.054
You think Claire and Randy
are gonna be okay?

40:05.098 --> 40:07.927
You think they're gonna
be okay with me?

40:07.970 --> 40:10.146
I really misjudged Randy.

40:10.190 --> 40:13.498
Well, I'm no expert,
but from my vantage point,

40:13.541 --> 40:15.369
it looked like they
couldn't wait to get home

40:15.413 --> 40:17.284
and resume their honeymoon.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.504
I think he knows you were
just doing your job,

40:19.547 --> 40:24.291
as a lawyer
and as an aunt.

40:24.334 --> 40:26.162
Oh, this is me.

40:26.206 --> 40:29.992
As always, a pleasure, Diana.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.081
Safe travels.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.867
Take care, Benny.All right.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.087
Bye.

40:46.356 --> 40:49.534
I have no idea what I'm gonna do
for the rest of my day.

40:49.577 --> 40:52.798
Hmm.

40:52.841 --> 40:56.105
I'm not really
good alone.

40:56.149 --> 40:59.457
Funny you should
mention that.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.416
You want to
get a drink?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.767
I would love
to get a drink.

41:08.596 --> 41:11.120
Oh. Baby,
the bar's over there.

41:11.164 --> 41:12.121
Yeah.

41:14.994 --> 41:16.430
Thing is...

41:17.649 --> 41:22.044
I'm actually trying
not to drink.

41:22.088 --> 41:24.960
You okay with that?

41:27.354 --> 41:29.530
Sure.

41:29.574 --> 41:33.012
Thing is, back in May,

41:33.055 --> 41:35.449
I-I had this... thing.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.277
Uh...

41:39.322 --> 41:40.846
I'll tell you about it later.

41:40.889 --> 41:43.196
You don't have to.I want to.

41:43.239 --> 41:46.068
Okay.

41:51.334 --> 41:55.948
Well... if we're not gonna
go to the bar,

41:55.991 --> 41:57.471
what would you like to do?

41:57.515 --> 42:00.953
Well, to be honest, I'd like to
go back up to your room

42:00.996 --> 42:02.563
and listen to you read
your opening statement

42:02.607 --> 42:04.130
to the jury again.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.001
I should slap you.

42:06.045 --> 42:09.265
Patience. I'm sure
we'll get to all of that.

42:09.309 --> 42:11.006
Well, thank goodness.

42:11.050 --> 42:13.008
Now where are
those elevators?

42:16.055 --> 42:17.230
♪ Let's stay together...

42:17.273 --> 42:19.493

that happened to you?

Oh, patience.
Your flight's not till tomorrow.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.149
I'm sure we'll get to it.
