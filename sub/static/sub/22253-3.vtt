Muffin, I've got to work on my book today,

10:17.089 --> 10:20.509
and I can't have a bunch of folks over
making a lot of noise.

10:20.592 --> 10:23.762
Oh, I see. I'm a burden to you.

10:23.846 --> 10:26.265
No, no, no, no, no.
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

10:26.349 --> 10:30.019
I'm no longer cute, so I have
nothing to offer this world.

10:30.102 --> 10:32.646
Honey, of course your friends
are always welcome here.

10:32.729 --> 10:34.690
Cool. Bye.

10:34.773 --> 10:36.650
- Can I invite a frien...
- No.

10:38.252 --> 10:40.337
You let that basket case into your house?

10:40.462 --> 10:43.049
That girl is a PR hurricane
that you don't need right now.

10:43.132 --> 10:46.260
She has nowhere else to turn.
She broke up with her boyfriend.

10:46.343 --> 10:48.721
She stabbed herself and closed
the wound with duct tape.

10:48.804 --> 10:49.972
- She fired her agent.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:50.056 --> 10:51.557
Back it up, horsey.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.350
Did you say Sarah Lynn
doesn't have an agent?

10:53.433 --> 10:55.561
Laura, hold my calls, cancel everything!

10:55.644 --> 10:57.950
Ahab's got a white whale to catch, baby!

10:57.985 --> 11:00.274
[vase smashes on the ground]
[footsteps]

11:00.357 --> 11:03.925
Uh, hello? Still there?

11:04.987 --> 11:07.907
[house music]

11:09.575 --> 11:11.785
Oh, th... that's...
that's fragile.

11:11.869 --> 11:13.162
Uh, no, oh, no, wait.
[glass breaking]

11:13.246 --> 11:14.413
Careful. Careful. Careful.

11:14.496 --> 11:16.290
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

11:16.373 --> 11:19.085
Ah! Lemur!

11:24.715 --> 11:27.593
[grunts]

11:31.180 --> 11:35.268
Great party, Sarah Lynn.
[blows raspberry]

11:35.350 --> 11:38.395
Hi, what it is, banana bread?

11:38.478 --> 11:40.355
I'm not looking for a new agent right now.

11:40.439 --> 11:43.567
Oh, whoa, whoa. Who says
I'm looking for a new client?

11:43.650 --> 11:45.527
Slow your roll, Speed Racer.

11:45.611 --> 11:48.822
We're just two single ladies
having a no-presh rap sesh.

11:48.906 --> 11:51.450
I'm not one of those agents
who can't turn it off.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.620
Your Ari Emanuels and Vanessa
Geckos and what have you.

11:54.703 --> 11:58.207
Vanessa Gecko is actually Andrew's
agent, and she's really great.

11:58.291 --> 12:01.418
Is she? [chuckles]
I've heard that.

12:03.712 --> 12:06.799
I didn't realize you
were so into house music.

12:06.882 --> 12:09.885
Look, I asked her to turn
it down, but apparently,

12:09.886 --> 12:11.887
this volume was prescribed by Dr. Who

12:11.971 --> 12:15.308
to treat something called
"uptight dickhead disease."

12:15.390 --> 12:17.810
What do you... What do
you think about Sarah Lynn?

12:17.893 --> 12:20.229
Oh, I don't really think
about her all that much.

12:20.313 --> 12:22.648
I mean, obviously, I'm
a fan of her early work

12:22.731 --> 12:25.252
which both satirized and
celebrated youth culture's

12:25.253 --> 12:28.112
obsession with sex, but I do
wonder as a third-wave feminist

12:28.195 --> 12:30.864
if it's even possible for
women to reclaim their sexuality

12:30.948 --> 12:32.908
in this deeply entrenched
patriarchal society,

12:32.992 --> 12:35.869
or if claiming to do so is
just a lie we tell ourselves

12:35.953 --> 12:37.830
so we can more comfortably
cater to the male gaze.

12:37.913 --> 12:39.665
- Uh, what?
- But you know,

12:39.748 --> 12:42.417
on the other hand, I worry
that conversations like this one

12:42.501 --> 12:44.544
often dismiss her as a mere
puppet of the industry...

12:44.628 --> 12:46.380
- That's my same worry.
- ... incapable of engaging

12:46.463 --> 12:48.715
- in these discussions herself...
- Obviously.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.093
... and infantilization,
which is itself a product

12:51.177 --> 12:52.427
- of the deeply misogynistic...
- So deep.

12:52.511 --> 12:54.513
... society we live in.
But like I said,

12:54.596 --> 12:56.307
I don't really think
about her all that much.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.684
Okay, well, that is very interesting,

12:58.767 --> 13:00.144
but I was more asking,

13:00.227 --> 13:01.895
like, what do you think
about her living here?

13:01.979 --> 13:06.150
Oh, right.
Well, what was your relationship like

13:06.233 --> 13:08.027
with her when you were working on the show?

13:08.110 --> 13:09.945
It was very good, very professional.

13:10.229 --> 13:13.366
BoJack, where did you go to college?

13:13.448 --> 13:15.951
- Don't bother him, honey.
- Oh, it's no problem.

13:16.035 --> 13:19.163
Honey, college is for ugly
people who can't tap dance.

13:19.246 --> 13:22.457
- I want to be an architect.
- [laughing] Sweetheart,

13:22.541 --> 13:25.444
Mommy didn't do what Mommy
did to that Star Search

13:25.445 --> 13:27.380
producer so that you
could be an architect.

13:27.462 --> 13:28.881
- Aw.
- All right,

13:28.964 --> 13:31.175
- take it sleazy, everybody.
- Wait, BoJack,

13:31.258 --> 13:33.802
um, what are you doing this weekend?

13:33.886 --> 13:36.368
I don't know. I'll probably
just go to the amusement park,

13:36.369 --> 13:38.849
maybe the circus, fly a kite
on the beach, watch the sunset,

13:38.932 --> 13:40.393
then I'll head back to my place

13:40.475 --> 13:42.019
to watch any number of
Disney princess movies

13:42.102 --> 13:44.063
while eating ice cream
straight from the tub.

13:44.146 --> 13:47.316
Whoa, that sounds like so much fun.
Can I come?

13:47.400 --> 13:49.818
[laughing] Yeah, like I
want to spend my weekend

13:49.902 --> 13:53.280
hanging out with a little girl.
[laughing] Good one!

13:53.364 --> 13:55.199
You should write for
the Shouts and Murmurs.

13:55.282 --> 13:56.450
See you Monday!

13:56.533 --> 13:58.551
So the makeup they
were putting on you was

13:58.552 --> 14:00.662
not for the show, it
was just for the weekend?

14:00.746 --> 14:03.916
- Why does that matter?
- I'm just trying to understand the story.

14:03.999 --> 14:05.959
Do you think it's possible
that you inviting Sarah Lynn

14:06.043 --> 14:08.712
into your house now is your
way of compensating for not...

14:08.837 --> 14:10.881
No, Diane, I'm just helping out a friend.

14:10.964 --> 14:13.592
I'm not trying to play out
some weird, sick dad fantasy,

14:13.675 --> 14:16.262
or resolve a deep guilt for past neglect,

14:16.345 --> 14:18.972
or even try to retroactively
fix my own childhood

14:19.056 --> 14:21.016
by recreating someone else's,

14:21.100 --> 14:24.311
and I'm especially not doing
all those things at once!

14:24.395 --> 14:25.562
[slurps]
Okay.

14:25.645 --> 14:27.356
[loud crash]
What happened?

14:27.440 --> 14:29.524
Did somebody hurt my precious baby?

14:29.608 --> 14:32.069
Sarah Lynn! Ah! What the... ?

14:32.152 --> 14:33.820
Oh, hey, BoJack.

14:33.904 --> 14:35.614
I told my friends they could
tear this wall out to build

14:35.697 --> 14:37.783
a sweet cocaine booth/sex closet.

14:37.866 --> 14:39.952
- Is that cool?
- No, that's not cool.

14:40.035 --> 14:42.037
Oof. Way to harsh the vibe, Kissinger.

14:42.121 --> 14:44.957
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.460
I thought this was a place where Sarah Lynn

14:47.542 --> 14:51.338
could finally be Sarah Lynn, but I guess...

14:51.464 --> 14:56.218
- that's too much, man.
- I always loved that catch phrase.

14:56.302 --> 14:58.762
Can your friends at least take
the artwork off the wall first?

14:58.845 --> 15:02.808
Ooh. I want to say yes, but no.

15:02.891 --> 15:06.937
- Okay, good talk.
- Wha... Are you serious?

15:08.506 --> 15:10.296
[music]

15:10.732 --> 15:13.902
The reason I have called
this house meeting is...

15:13.986 --> 15:15.904
Todd, how many times
have we been over this?

15:15.988 --> 15:18.407
You don't have the authority
to call house meetings.

15:18.491 --> 15:20.305
Only I can call a house meeting.

15:20.306 --> 15:22.119
You can propose a house meeting.

15:22.202 --> 15:24.121
All right, fine, fine, fine,
but the reason I propose

15:24.204 --> 15:25.705
- this house meeting...
- Your proposal has been

15:25.789 --> 15:27.958
submitted and is under board review.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.419
- Proposal denied.
- BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing

15:30.503 --> 15:33.839
is getting out of control, okay?
She's taking advantage of you.

15:33.922 --> 15:36.550
What? No she's not. We
have a special relationship.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.302
You couldn't possibly understand.

15:38.385 --> 15:40.554
Oh, my God. Look at what
she's done to your house.

15:40.637 --> 15:42.639
All right, look, I mean, I
stepped on a needle earlier.

15:42.722 --> 15:44.224
I think I'm addicted to heroin now,

15:44.308 --> 15:46.685
so now, that's probably
gonna be a whole thing.

15:46.768 --> 15:48.603
I have to say, I agree with Todd.

15:48.687 --> 15:50.230
You're not this girl's father,
and you're not doing her

15:50.314 --> 15:52.483
any favors by refusing to set boundaries.

15:52.566 --> 15:54.860
Look, I played a dad for nine years on TV,

15:54.943 --> 15:56.862
so I think I know a little
bit more about parenting

15:56.945 --> 15:59.031
than you two jokers.
The kids on Horsin' Around

15:59.114 --> 16:00.657
didn't need boundaries.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.118
All they needed was some
good, old-fashioned love.

16:03.202 --> 16:05.704
BoJack!
This is not a TV show, okay?

16:05.787 --> 16:07.622
This is real life.

16:07.706 --> 16:10.876
Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire!

16:14.087 --> 16:16.840
Some good, old-fashioned love,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

16:16.923 --> 16:21.387
I'm gonna give it to her so... hard.

16:21.470 --> 16:23.763
You know, I feel like
we don't ever hang out.

16:26.350 --> 16:27.518
Here you are, milady,

16:27.601 --> 16:30.645
a gin and nutmeg just like you asked.

16:30.729 --> 16:32.606
Ugh. Too much nutmeg.

16:32.689 --> 16:34.900
Well, you know what
would taste even better?

16:34.983 --> 16:37.486
An endorsement for a Slovakian yogurt.

16:37.570 --> 16:39.613
Could Vanessa Gecko get you that?

16:39.696 --> 16:43.576
Vanessa Gecko got Andrew
The Social Network,

16:43.658 --> 16:46.036
and she has skybox seats
at the Staples Center.

16:46.119 --> 16:47.704
- What do you have?
- Well, I've got a table

16:47.787 --> 16:49.415
at the Comedy Central
roast of Gloria Stein...

16:49.498 --> 16:51.584
Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say
we spend the day together,

16:51.666 --> 16:54.127
just you and me, away from all the haters?

16:54.211 --> 16:57.548

17:19.903 --> 17:22.696
Hey, did you hear Kazaz got cancer?

17:22.781 --> 17:24.617
What? Herb Kazaz has cancer?

17:24.699 --> 17:27.953
Yeah, in the butt. He's got,
like, six months I think.

17:28.036 --> 17:30.330
Well, that's horrible. Why
would you tell me that now?

17:30.414 --> 17:32.874
I don't know. The sun
setting over those two hills

made me think of a big
ass, and that made me think

17:34.834 --> 17:36.503
of ass cancer, and that made me think

17:36.587 --> 17:39.756
of Herb Kazaz's ass cancer.
You really didn't know?

- It's the most prestigious award I ever won.

I always thought if I
ever had kids of my own,

17:52.436 --> 17:55.147
I'd give it to them one day.
I want you to have it.

This pawnshop on La Cienega was selling one

You are in big trouble, young lady.

18:59.461 --> 19:01.463
I can't believe you pawned my award.

19:01.547 --> 19:04.383
It wasn't personal. I just
thought your award was stupid,

19:04.466 --> 19:06.218
and I already have a billion other awards,

19:06.301 --> 19:08.011

I was packing stadiums.

19:24.528 --> 19:27.406
I get letters every
day from boys telling me

19:27.489 --> 19:29.824
that I was the first
girl they masturbated to.

19:29.908 --> 19:32.786
Literally, someone tells me that every day.

19:32.869 --> 19:35.748
- That is gross.
- Oh-ho, I know!

19:35.830 --> 19:37.957
You sit up here in your little house

19:38.041 --> 19:41.086
and feel sorry for yourself?
Oh, guess what, Bo-J,

19:41.169 --> 19:43.171
in order to be a has-been,
you have to have actually,

19:43.255 --> 19:45.965
- you know, been.
- You are way out of line!

19:46.049 --> 19:48.343
You're not my dad. You're
just a rugged, older man

19:48.427 --> 19:50.512
who provided me with a
strong, masculine presence

19:50.596 --> 19:52.097
during my formative years.

19:52.180 --> 19:54.015
I'm not your dad, and you're not my child.

19:54.099 --> 19:56.685
We're just a man and a lady
living in a house together,

19:56.769 --> 19:59.187
and we're both adults, and
we're both a little drunk.

20:00.606 --> 20:03.400
[both groaning]

20:04.484 --> 20:08.321
<i>Who-o-o lit my
ottoman on fire?</i>

20:08.405 --> 20:13.952
- Seriously, you seriously don't know?
- I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

20:14.035 --> 20:16.204
Yeah, you are bad, very bad!

20:16.288 --> 20:20.459
You want me to put it out
with my boob?

20:20.542 --> 20:22.294
- Uh, what?
- Your boob

20:22.377 --> 20:26.423
is a very impractical
way to put out a fire.

20:26.506 --> 20:27.800
What is happening?

20:27.882 --> 20:29.926
I think you have a serious drug problem.

20:30.009 --> 20:33.221
The only drug I need is horse.

20:33.305 --> 20:34.848
Guys, guys, what are you doing?

20:34.931 --> 20:36.182
Please don't do this.
[both moaning]

20:36.266 --> 20:38.435
No, no. Why are you...
[both moaning]

20:38.518 --> 20:40.312
[whinnies]
This is a very bad idea.

20:40.395 --> 20:42.021
[both moaning]
Can I at least get my blanket...

20:42.105 --> 20:43.607
let me get my blanket out from under...

20:43.690 --> 20:45.317
Oh G...
Oh, my God, my arm.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.985
- You got my arm.
- [laughs] Ow! Ow!

20:47.068 --> 20:49.404
I'm in it now. Oh, God,
no! I'm a part of it.

20:49.488 --> 20:50.739
[both moaning]

20:53.617 --> 20:56.161
I still haven't regained
the feeling in my fingers.

20:56.244 --> 20:58.163
That was the longest
two minutes of my life.

20:58.246 --> 21:00.874
Um, I think it was a little
longer than two minutes.

21:00.957 --> 21:02.459
It was longer than two minutes.

21:02.542 --> 21:05.504
How do you not get that this is terrible?

21:05.587 --> 21:07.255
Oh, you mean from a P.R. standpoint?

21:07.339 --> 21:10.175
Yeah, 'cause if this got
out, oh, I would get flayed!

21:10.258 --> 21:13.386
Oh, I'm done being the voice of reason.

21:13.470 --> 21:17.098
It's exhausting. I got
to take an angry nap.

21:17.182 --> 21:19.518
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

21:19.601 --> 21:21.978
I know. I know. She's
taking advantage of me.

21:22.061 --> 21:23.730
Actually, it kind of
feels like you're the one

21:23.814 --> 21:25.440
taking advantage of her.
She's the one

21:25.524 --> 21:27.942
with substance abuse
problems and daddy issues.

21:28.026 --> 21:29.736
Hey, we both have substance abuse problems

21:29.820 --> 21:31.905
- and daddy issues.
- Yeah, but she came

21:31.988 --> 21:34.949
to you for help.
[sighs]

21:36.409 --> 21:37.952
Hey, notice how I've been ignoring you,

21:38.036 --> 21:40.413
playing hard to get?
Only makes you want me more.

21:40.497 --> 21:42.123
Ugh. Go stand on the
other side of the room.

21:42.207 --> 21:44.125
- Okay.
- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

21:44.209 --> 21:46.336
- I'm taking you to rehab.
- Nah,

21:46.419 --> 21:48.588
I was gonna keep hanging
out here if that's all right.

21:48.672 --> 21:50.757
- No, it's not all right.
- What?

21:50.841 --> 21:52.592
This place isn't good for you.

21:52.676 --> 21:55.470
You need to go where you
can get help, real help.

21:55.554 --> 21:57.723
But I thought you were
always gonna be there for me

21:57.806 --> 21:58.973
like you said.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.685
I will always be there for you.

22:01.768 --> 22:03.395
<i>Cut, let's take ten.</i>

22:03.478 --> 22:06.314
That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.

22:06.398 --> 22:07.566
These pages are shit.
[coughs]

22:07.649 --> 22:09.150
you understand? Shit.

22:09.234 --> 22:10.819
I wouldn't wipe my ass with these pages.

22:10.903 --> 22:12.571
It would defeat the whole
purpose of wiping my ass.

22:12.654 --> 22:14.406
- Phone for you.
- Uh-huh.

22:14.489 --> 22:16.032
You get me points on the back end?

22:16.115 --> 22:18.785
[coughs] Well, I told you I'm not
gonna do it unless I get points.

22:18.869 --> 22:20.370
Oh, they can't find any?

22:20.453 --> 22:21.663
Well, maybe they could
suck some out of my dick!

22:21.747 --> 22:23.039
[coughs]
I'm on the phone.

22:23.122 --> 22:26.000
You're being very rude.
[laughs]

22:26.084 --> 22:28.211
You promised me you would always be there.

22:28.294 --> 22:30.630
Sarah Lynn, this is for your own good.

22:30.714 --> 22:32.298
You can't stay here anymore.

22:32.382 --> 22:35.027
Okie-doke. I guess I'll
just move out and find one of

22:35.028 --> 22:37.721
the billion people who will
let me party at their house.

22:37.804 --> 22:40.557
Uh, well, you should not do that.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.268
Oh, I know.
I know, but I can, so I will.

22:43.351 --> 22:45.186
I'm at a place right now where I never need

22:45.270 --> 22:48.106
to grow as a person or rise to an occasion

22:48.189 --> 22:50.692
because I can constantly
just surround myself

22:50.776 --> 22:53.278
with sycophants and enablers
until I die tragically young.

22:53.361 --> 22:58.241
- Wh-What?
- Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me.

22:58.324 --> 23:01.160
Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.

23:01.244 --> 23:03.914
Oh, by the way, I called Vanessa Gecko,

23:03.997 --> 23:05.582
and I'm meeting with her tomorrow.

23:05.665 --> 23:08.293
- Thanks for the suggestion.
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

23:08.376 --> 23:11.504
Hey, you guys want to
hear my new catchphrase?

23:11.588 --> 23:15.300
Suck a dick, dumb shits!
[blows raspberry]

23:15.383 --> 23:17.343
[grunting]

23:17.427 --> 23:20.179
Laura, the dummy took the
bait. Now for phase two.

23:20.263 --> 23:23.976
Is she gone?
Is it safe to come out?

23:24.058 --> 23:26.060
Leak to the trades that
Andrew Garfield's agent

23:26.144 --> 23:29.063
is taking meetings with his
ex, get it all over town,

23:29.147 --> 23:30.983
wait an hour, then get me lunch with Andrew

23:31.065 --> 23:34.694
on the books for this
weekend, someplace Italian.

23:34.778 --> 23:36.446
I really blew it, didn't I?

23:36.529 --> 23:38.907
I mean, maybe you could
have been a better role model

23:38.991 --> 23:41.910
when she was young, but also,
she never really had a chance.

23:41.994 --> 23:44.037
This is what our celebrity
culture does to people.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.808
So what you're saying is:

23:45.809 --> 23:48.768
Everything is society's
fault, and we as individuals

23:48.769 --> 23:51.336
never need to take
responsibility for anything?

23:51.419 --> 23:54.006
Uh, no. Not exactly.
I was just saying that...

23:54.088 --> 23:56.591
Yeah. I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong

23:56.675 --> 23:58.259
because I can't do anything wrong

23:58.343 --> 24:00.053
because we're all just
products of our environment,

24:00.136 --> 24:01.346
bouncing around like marbles

24:01.429 --> 24:02.806
in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos

24:02.889 --> 24:04.516
that is our random and cruel universe.

24:04.599 --> 24:06.225
Wait, no, that's not
even what I'm saying...

24:06.309 --> 24:08.854
Yeah, It's not my fault. It's society.

24:08.937 --> 24:11.439
Everything is because of society!

24:11.523 --> 24:13.733
- BoJack, that...
- Dude, just let him have this.

24:13.817 --> 24:16.152
Hooray!
Everything is meaningless!

24:16.235 --> 24:18.989
<i>Nothing I do has consequence!</i>

24:21.324 --> 24:25.453
- So what'd you get, anything good?
- Oh, I got everything.

24:25.537 --> 24:29.290
