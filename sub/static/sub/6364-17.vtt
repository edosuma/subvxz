08:36.984 --> 08:39.049
Well, too bad, 'cause we
can't get anywhere near him.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.552
The feds are afraid
we're gonna set off

08:40.554 --> 08:42.953
Some sex scandal
with a foreign crony.

08:44.925 --> 08:45.440
(kevin)
i got a ci escort
who works the wexford.

08:45.441 --> 08:45.956
I can reach out.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.993
Do it.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.294
All right, you start
with the body.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.695
Hey, keep him company.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.604
Was she a party girl?

08:59.606 --> 09:01.606
No.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.208
No, she was, like...

09:03.210 --> 09:04.776
Full of life.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.311
Out of that whole group
that i was under with,

09:06.313 --> 09:08.313
This girl,
she actually stood out.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.882
She was different.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.884
Was she a flirt?

09:12.886 --> 09:13.985
Yeah, a little.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.186
I mean, you know,
she's a young pretty girl.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.288
Of course she was.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.773
Nothing happened
between her and me, man.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.257
Nothing at all.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.193
All right?

09:22.195 --> 09:25.564
The tox report won't be in
until at least next week.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.533
And the blood test
shows alcohol

09:28.534 --> 09:29.333
And benzodiazepine.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.669
Xanax.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.003
That or something
like it.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.639
And she has bruising
behind her left triceps,

09:34.641 --> 09:36.708
Which might indicate
someone right-handed

09:36.710 --> 09:37.776
Grabbed her forcibly.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.644
Okay, so homicide.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.279
That's your job.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.782
(coroner)
but if she was thrown over,

09:43.784 --> 09:46.117
With all that booze
and pills in her,

09:46.119 --> 09:50.155
I doubt she could have
put up much of a fight.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.189
Thank you.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.593
Oh, no.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.973
[voice breaking]
that's her.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.674
It's felicia.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.114
You guys the police?

10:16.116 --> 10:19.851
Yes, sir.

10:19.853 --> 10:23.021
Mr. Hughes, we're so
very sorry for your loss.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.259
I'm sorry to do this, sir.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.363
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

10:31.365 --> 10:32.664
Yeah.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.834
Was felicia living
at home, sir?

10:35.836 --> 10:38.803
Yeah, she was.

10:38.805 --> 10:39.904
Do you know if she was
supposed to meet

10:39.906 --> 10:43.008
With anyone tonight?

10:43.010 --> 10:44.643
I wouldn't know.

10:44.645 --> 10:48.713
Was she having problems
with anyone, a boyfriend?

10:49.716 --> 10:53.184
No, no, everybody loved her.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.887
If you knew her,
you loved her.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.689
I knew her.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.996
Copy that, sergeant.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.197
Voight wants us
to hang around

11:06.199 --> 11:09.434
And see if anyone
from black grid shows up.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.202
You want half?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.237
I'm good.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.938
- You sure?
- Yeah, i'm good.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.110
Back in the 31st,
you ever work undercover?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.046
Yeah, a bunch of times.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.313
My go-to
is the irish guy

11:22.315 --> 11:26.084
Scoring weed
for his friends.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.287
You ever meet
a girl undercover?

11:29.289 --> 11:30.922
One time, i got loaned
out to gangs,

11:30.924 --> 11:34.759
Was paired up with this ci,
smoking-hot biker chick.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.194
(roman)
we pretended to be a couple,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.329
Bought guns
off the outlaws.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.165
The things you got to do
to convince people

11:40.167 --> 11:43.268
You're boyfriend
and girlfriend...

11:43.270 --> 11:45.236
I'll leave it at that.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.939
So were you and jen
together then or...?

11:47.941 --> 11:50.275
Yeah, i think so, why?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.780
Listen, there's
no way ruzek

11:55.782 --> 11:58.383
Had something going on
with the victim.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.085
The guy adores you.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.219
I know it's part
of the job.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.221
I just...
I...

12:04.424 --> 12:06.458
Someone he knew died.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.426
He's pissed off.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.729
Let him run with it.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.964
You'd want him
to do the same for you.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.204
I do want half.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.371
Yeah.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.076
Thanks.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.915
Hey.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.252
I've got a date
with a dentist.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.021
Do you know how hard it is
to land a good dentist?

12:37.023 --> 12:41.359
Were you working
the wexford earlier?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.861
You see her there?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.529
I heard about her.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.064
Such a shame.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.233
Yes or no?

12:48.235 --> 12:50.135
Yeah, she was there.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.971
I noticed her because
i'd never seen her before.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.172
She looked
a little nervous.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.841
It looked like it was
her first time out tricking.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.343
So she was
on the clock.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.012
She wasn't there
for the bar snacks.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.413
Was she approached
by anyone?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.449
Um...Yeah,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.951
Some big-shot latin guy,

13:06.953 --> 13:08.987
With one hell of a suit.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.188
Him?

13:12.259 --> 13:14.092
Him.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.326
[sighs]

13:21.134 --> 13:24.369
So why would she be
hooking at the wexford?

13:24.371 --> 13:26.504
All right, maybe
it's a honey trap

13:26.506 --> 13:28.940
Set up by the black grid.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.809
Get picked up
by someone at the conference,

13:30.811 --> 13:33.444
Someone like
this prick sosa, right?

13:33.446 --> 13:34.846
Incriminate him.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.282
Now, how they knew that
he would beeline for her

13:37.284 --> 13:39.017
Instead of all the other girls
in the bar that night,

13:39.019 --> 13:40.018
I don't know, but--

13:40.020 --> 13:41.352
Because she was 18.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.490
Well, i put a call
into interpol--

13:45.492 --> 13:48.326
One of the few perks
of working on a task force--

13:48.328 --> 13:52.230
And it turns out sosa has quite
a reputation with the ladies.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.965
They've linked him
to escort services

13:53.967 --> 13:55.834
In half a dozen cities.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.168
He was even charged
with soliciting

13:57.170 --> 13:58.570
Down in australia,

13:58.572 --> 14:00.305
But his consulate
got it squashed.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.273
(mouse)
and i've got his itinerary.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.609
He's supposed to go
to a global currency meeting

14:04.611 --> 14:06.511
At mccormick place
in an hour.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.112
Let's grab him up.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.148
You know we can't
legally detain sosa

14:10.150 --> 14:12.283
Without the feds'
cooperation, right?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.085
And agent rose hasn't
returned any of my calls.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.386
So read into that
however you want.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.288
Are you kidding me?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.389
This girl's from lincoln park.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.557
She's from chicago.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.594
We're gonna let this guy
come in...

14:22.596 --> 14:24.929
And kill her and throw her
out a window like a bag of trash

14:24.931 --> 14:26.064
And then he just
gets away with it?

14:26.066 --> 14:27.599
Is that how
we're gonna play this?

14:33.473 --> 14:36.975
You ever hear of rendition?

14:36.977 --> 14:40.645
We have.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.281
All right,
everybody vest up.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.950
We're gonna show him
the chicago version.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.095
[tires screech]

15:00.500 --> 15:01.532
Guns on the ground!

15:01.534 --> 15:03.534
Cpd!
Gun on the ground now!

15:03.536 --> 15:04.669
(officer)
drop your weapon!

15:04.671 --> 15:06.104
(erin)
put the gun down!

15:06.106 --> 15:07.372
(officer)
drop your weapons, do it!

15:07.374 --> 15:09.407
(officer)
guns down!

15:09.409 --> 15:11.109
Hey.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.644
You know where you are?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.981
This is chicago.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.617
Our soil.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.020
And believe me...

15:22.022 --> 15:23.922
One way or another,

15:23.924 --> 15:26.124
We're gonna talk
to your boss.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.125
What about you?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.294
You think i'm bluffing?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.129
Put your gun down.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.931
Put your gun down.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.966
(officer)
guns down, put 'em down.
Get against the car.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.184
(officer 2)
hands on the car now!

15:36.185 --> 15:37.401
(officer)
hands against the car.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.436
Hands against the car.

15:41.675 --> 15:44.208
Come on.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.276
When i get to your station,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.412
I'm calling
the argentine consulate.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.448
Well, we ain't going
to no station, honey.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.950
Come on.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.190
Come here.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.658
Hey, jagoff.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.428
- Come on, come on.
- Carmine.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.662
Got some wine here.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.998
We're good, carm,
thanks though.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.741
What happened
at the hotel?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.276
I've already talked
to the fbi.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.244
Now you're talking
to us.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.679
I don't know who she is.
I never met her.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.047
I don't know how she died.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.316
You were seen leaving
the hotel bar with her.

16:28.989 --> 16:29.688
Whoever is making that claim
is mistaken.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.388
One of you is.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.357
(alvin)
so you pick her up at the bar.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.558
You take her
up to your room.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.226
You ask her
for something

16:35.228 --> 16:37.495
She didn't
want to provide,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.130
Or she insulted you,
whatever the reason,

16:39.132 --> 16:40.665
Things went bad,
right?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.717
But you don't look to me

16:42.718 --> 16:44.768
Like the kind of guy
who does the heavy lifting.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.205
Oh, you got
other people for that?

16:47.207 --> 16:49.407
(alvin)
what? What--what happened?

16:49.409 --> 16:52.677
One of your bodyguards
come in, toss her over?

16:52.679 --> 16:57.315
I mean, if so,
just give us his name,

16:57.317 --> 16:59.150
And you'll walk.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.551
I've already told you,

17:00.553 --> 17:05.623
I have no idea
what happened to that woman.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.393
Now, i want to be released,
and i want my phone back.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.796
The funny thing
about that phone.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.332
Our tech guy
is on it right now.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.101
Took him about two minutes
to crack mine.

17:17.103 --> 17:20.338
What's he gonna find
on yours?

17:20.339 --> 17:23.473
You are making
a massive, massive mistake

17:23.476 --> 17:26.109
Right now.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.780
I've made them before.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.651
Hey, chuckles.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.686
Detective chuckles,
if you don't mind.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.789
Little donnybrook
down at kitty o'shea's.

17:37.791 --> 17:40.625
Officer on the scene wanted
to know if you'd stop by.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.627
To do what, show him
how to do his job?

17:42.629 --> 17:45.563
No, keep your brother
from getting locked up.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.303
- Hey, sarge?
- There you go.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.405
[men shouting]
- hey, tommy, that's it!

17:54.407 --> 17:55.740
- That's it!
- 21-30 squad.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.675
It's gonna be
an id, paul.

17:57.677 --> 17:58.776
What'd he do?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.411
Nothing, it's these
other two knuckleheads.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.246
But he kept getting
between me and them, so...

18:02.248 --> 18:03.748
Hey.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.283
Jay.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.651
What the hell's
going on?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.453
[men shouting]

18:08.455 --> 18:09.454
What are you doing?

18:09.456 --> 18:10.521
I don't care who.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.690
One of them's
got to go.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.791
Tommy, nothing against you.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.792
Take a walk.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.160
- Aw, come on, man--
- walk!

18:16.162 --> 18:17.728
He's the problem.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.263
All right, we're good.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.599
- That was fun.
- Yeah, good time.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.335
Hey, i thought you were
getting in next week.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.170
I moved it up.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.706
How long you in town for?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.641
They haven't
decided yet.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.276
Can we get another round
back there, please?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.145
Don't you have
a medical practice,

18:34.147 --> 18:35.379
Something like that?

18:35.381 --> 18:36.681
I took a break.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.182
So you got fired?

18:38.184 --> 18:40.184
Dude, just tell me.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.686
Will you relax
and have a beer?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.621
Can't, man, i'm working.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.722
That's right.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.692
Get over here.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.894
It's good to see you.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.429
Stop by the district later.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.897
I will, i will.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.398
Go save the city.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.739
Did you crack
sosa's phone yet?

19:01.741 --> 19:05.309
Yeah, like,
two minutes ago.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.879
Then you pick up
the phone and call me.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.147
Yes, ma'am.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.182
Lindsay.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.316
Yep.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.154
Can i see it?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.356
Hmm?
Yeah, of course.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.658
Here, just one second.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.363
Is it legal to open
unread emails?

19:25.365 --> 19:29.600
We're pretty much past
that at this point.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.868
Okay.

19:30.870 --> 19:34.572
"you will deposit $200,000
into the following account

19:34.574 --> 19:35.907
"within 12 hours,
or this video

19:35.909 --> 19:38.576
"will be released
to news outlets worldwide.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.545
"you are already
a philanderer.

19:40.547 --> 19:45.383
Do you want to be
called a murderer?"

19:45.385 --> 19:47.251
That--that's
a blackmail letter.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.220
You think?

19:49.222 --> 19:51.355
Okay, you're being
sarcastic.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.225
Okay, that's cool.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.293
That's all right.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.495
I deserved it,
won't happen again.

19:57.497 --> 20:02.200
And...There's
a video attached.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.238
Well, that's your girl--
well, our girl.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.606
Can i say that
now that i'm on the team?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.341
Can you fast-forward this?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.780
<i>Que preciosa.</i>

20:20.520 --> 20:22.720
(erin)
send it to voight.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.590
[heavy breathing]

20:25.592 --> 20:27.358
You can turn it off now.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.467
Never met
felicia hughes, huh?

20:36.469 --> 20:37.735
[sighs]

20:47.880 --> 20:51.582
She said her name
was sierra.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.850
Hmm.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.854
She approached me
at the bar.

20:56.856 --> 21:00.858
We talked.

21:00.860 --> 21:04.462
And, well,
you know the rest.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.730
But i swear,

21:05.732 --> 21:08.266
When i left that room,
she was alive.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.468
I swear on my
daughter's life.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.705
Well, he's not
blackmailing himself.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.441
Exactly, exactly,
thank you.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.477
You see anybody
on the 20th floor

21:19.479 --> 21:21.912
Didn't belong there?

21:21.914 --> 21:24.048
Not that i recall.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.950
She seemed really unhappy.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.320
I really thought
she jumped.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.522
You got a beef with
anybody on your staff?

21:31.524 --> 21:32.757
No.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.325
I mean, petty stuff.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.861
No one who would
do something like this.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.463
Mouse got a location
for where the email was sent.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.898
Our guys are
checking out a house

21:40.900 --> 21:45.002
Owned by jeanette rutowski.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.604
You know that name?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.439
No.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.442
I never heard of it.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.843
Get up.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.081
I imagine you want us
to keep quiet

21:57.083 --> 22:01.419
About that video.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.889
Let's come to some agreement
as to why you were brought here.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.657
[chuckles]

22:10.630 --> 22:13.064
I wanted to see chicago.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.432
Mm-hmm.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.567
We came here
for a drink.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.803
Your friend carmine
gave me a cup

22:18.805 --> 22:21.339
Of lovely white zinfandel
from that box of wine

22:21.341 --> 22:23.040
He had by his feet.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.475
Cheers.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.784
It's locked.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.889
Rutowski, chicago pd.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.024
Clear.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.728
- Clear.
- Clear.

22:46.766 --> 22:47.965
Hey.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.638
Oh-ho.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.411
Look at this.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.513
Rutowski sure has
a lot of fake ids.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.419
You son of a bitch.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.955
You recognize him?

23:10.957 --> 23:12.156
It's mad max.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.658
He's the leader
of black grid.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.862
(antonio)
this is mason rutowski,
aka mad max.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.630
Turns out he's
a part-time instructor

23:19.632 --> 23:21.432
Of political science
at depaul.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.434
We checked with
the county assessor's office.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.870
Max's mother,
jeanette rutowski.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.138
She passed away
a few months back,

23:27.140 --> 23:28.806
Left him the house.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.473
The reason the deed wasn't
transferred to his name yet,

23:30.476 --> 23:32.410
He couldn't afford
to pay the back taxes.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.812
So if i'm a broke
part-time teacher

23:34.814 --> 23:36.580
Living in
my mom's basement,

23:36.582 --> 23:38.048
I might be looking
to shake somebody down

23:38.050 --> 23:39.517
For some cash.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.751
We got an investigative
alert lodged

23:40.753 --> 23:42.086
To state police
and the sheriffs.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.087
All right, all right.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.756
Mad max--
rutowski--

23:45.758 --> 23:46.991
Is supposed to
send out instructions

23:46.993 --> 23:48.759
To all the black grid
members today.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.961
Just got this:
"2:00 pm, freedom plaza.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.030
Target, saudi prince,
bring your helmets."

23:53.032 --> 23:54.432
They wear
motorcycle helmets

23:54.434 --> 23:55.733
To conceal
their identities.

23:55.735 --> 23:56.934
All right,
let's hit the plaza.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.769
We'll surveil the group
and pick him up.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.171
Sarge, we got
another problem.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.572
They got cell jammers.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.174
Block reception
in the entire area.

24:03.176 --> 24:06.777
No, no, no, we could use
the old cpd analog radios.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.479
They use that old
trunk band.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.014
You ain't blocking
those babies.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.483
I'll dig 'em up.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.519
(agent rose)
i told you, hands off sosa.

24:15.521 --> 24:16.754
Then you kidnap him?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.489
He wanted to see chicago.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.024
You didn't think his
bodyguards would contact me

24:20.026 --> 24:21.158
To say that your unit
grabbed him

24:21.160 --> 24:22.526
Off the street
in broad daylight?

24:22.528 --> 24:23.761
Did you talk
to sosa himself?

24:23.763 --> 24:25.029
'cause i'm sure
he has a different story.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.030
I did.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.865
White zinfandel, huh?

24:27.867 --> 24:29.533
Seemed to enjoy it.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.769
I could have you arrested
for official misconduct.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.170
That goes for all of you.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.939
Agent rose,
there's no need to go there,

24:34.941 --> 24:36.941
Because if the sergeant here
so much as looks

24:36.943 --> 24:38.576
At another foreign dignitary,

24:38.578 --> 24:40.044
I'll strip his badge myself,

24:40.046 --> 24:42.780
And i'll reassign
his entire unit to patrol.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.114
Am i clear, sergeant?

24:44.116 --> 24:45.649
Yes, commander.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.985
Listen,
i'd see you out,

24:47.987 --> 24:50.754
But i have paperwork
to bury this unit in.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.266
[laughs slightly]

25:05.571 --> 25:07.638
(protesters)
the whole world's watching!

25:07.640 --> 25:09.206
The whole world's watching!

25:09.208 --> 25:11.041
The whole world's watching!

25:11.043 --> 25:12.776
The whole world's watching!

25:12.778 --> 25:14.178
The whole world's watching!

25:14.180 --> 25:15.813
The whole world's watching!

25:15.815 --> 25:18.115
The whole world's watching!

25:18.117 --> 25:20.784
(hank)
patrol, can you hear me?

25:20.786 --> 25:24.154
(roman)
yes, sir,
i got eyes on the front row.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.756
(hank)
lindsay, what's your 20?

25:25.758 --> 25:27.825
I've got eyes
on the ground.

25:30.930 --> 25:31.913
Ruzek, you see
any familiar faces?

25:31.914 --> 25:32.897
Negative, boss.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.899
(adam)
getting another message.

25:34.901 --> 25:38.302
It says,
"time to change the world.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.170
Cell-jammers,
the time is now."

25:40.172 --> 25:41.839
(protesters)
the whole world's watching!

25:41.841 --> 25:43.641
The whole world's watching!

25:43.643 --> 25:45.743
The whole world's watching!

25:45.745 --> 25:47.111
Yeah, they're here.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.046
(adam)
all right, i see
some black grid people

25:49.048 --> 25:51.315
With cell-jammers
heading towards the barricade.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.217
I don't see rutowski.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.920
I'm gonna follow them,
see if i can find him.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.087
Lindsay, you cover him.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.989
The rest,
you handle the others.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.190
Got it.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.759
(protesters)
the whole world's watching!

26:01.761 --> 26:03.260
The whole world's watching!

26:03.262 --> 26:05.062
The whole world's watching!

26:05.064 --> 26:06.947
Hey.

26:06.948 --> 26:08.831
Guys, what's up?
You seen mad max?

26:08.834 --> 26:09.833
No?

26:09.835 --> 26:11.769
Hey, mad max,
you seen him?

26:11.771 --> 26:13.070
Hey, where the hell's mad max?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.838
He said he'll be here.
I don't know when.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.106
All right.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.808
(protesters)
the whole world's watching!

26:17.810 --> 26:19.643
The whole world's watching!

26:19.645 --> 26:21.078
The whole world's watching!

26:21.080 --> 26:22.913
The whole world's watching!

26:22.915 --> 26:24.915
The whole world's watching!

26:24.917 --> 26:26.584
The whole world's watching!

26:26.586 --> 26:27.685
The whole world's watching!

26:27.687 --> 26:28.786
(kim)
out of the way, out of the way!

26:28.788 --> 26:29.787
What did i say?

26:29.789 --> 26:31.589
You, give me this.

26:31.591 --> 26:32.957
Where's mad max?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.325
(hank)
got more helmets moving in.

26:34.327 --> 26:35.326
This way.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.895
Out of the way!

26:37.897 --> 26:39.964
- Chicago pd, stop right there!
- Stop what you're doing.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.065
(officer)
back up, back up!

26:41.067 --> 26:42.366
Get against the wall--hey!

26:42.368 --> 26:44.368
Spread out,
spread your hands out.

26:44.369 --> 26:46.369
Spread your hands out
and don't move.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.371
Helmets off!

26:47.373 --> 26:48.772
Cpd, helmets off!

26:48.774 --> 26:49.773
(erin) chicago pd!
- Where's mad max?

26:49.775 --> 26:50.874
Take your helmets off!

26:50.876 --> 26:51.875
- Off!
- Burgess!

26:51.877 --> 26:53.911
- Hey!
- Got him!

26:59.018 --> 27:00.718
[taser zaps]

27:03.322 --> 27:04.722
Stay down!

27:08.628 --> 27:09.793
(adam)
hands behind your back.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.228
Behind your back!

27:14.734 --> 27:15.899
Good job.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.075
Man, i can't believe
you're a cop.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.276
(erin)
i hear the name mad max,

27:26.278 --> 27:28.679
And i'm expecting a record
as long as my arm.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.648
All i found on you
is a charge for trespassing

27:30.650 --> 27:32.316
At an oil refinery
in minnesota.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.018
It was a greenpeace rally.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.119
No one was hurt.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.286
Not that time.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.321
You've certainly
upped your game

27:37.323 --> 27:39.189
Since then, haven't you?

27:39.191 --> 27:41.692
We know you sent this
to fabian sosa.

27:41.694 --> 27:42.960
$200,000?

27:42.962 --> 27:45.195
Is that how you planned
on paying off your mom's house?

27:45.197 --> 27:47.698
Use the rest
to fund your little group?

27:47.700 --> 27:48.966
What?

27:48.968 --> 27:50.834
Felicia hughes,
she's the perfect dupe.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.903
I mean, am i right?

27:52.905 --> 27:53.904
(adam)
she's a pretty girl.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.439
She's trusting, naive.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.740
You figure
you dangle her

27:56.742 --> 27:58.008
In front of
a wealthy dignitary,

27:58.010 --> 27:59.209
He's gonna take her
into his room.

27:59.211 --> 28:02.780
You can come back later,
sting him for some cash.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.781
I didn't write this.

28:03.783 --> 28:04.848
I didn't send this.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.216
Here's how we see it.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.452
You con felicia
into playing prostitute

28:08.454 --> 28:09.920
So that hopefully
damian sosa

28:09.922 --> 28:11.155
Picks her up at the bar.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.323
You feed her a bunch
of revolutionary b.S.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.859
About how you're gonna
take down some oppressive tyrant

28:17.730 --> 28:18.746
And rainbows are
gonna criss-cross the sky,

28:18.747 --> 28:19.763
But she finds out you're just
there to line your pockets.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.398
How dare you
even suggest that.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.733
Then who did it?
Who did this?

28:22.735 --> 28:24.001
I don't know.

28:24.002 --> 28:25.268
Someone must have
hacked my internet.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.238
Yeah, the whole "somebody
hacked my internet" defense

28:28.240 --> 28:30.741
Doesn't really hold up
in court, matt.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.917
[chair rattles]

28:42.154 --> 28:43.787
Why'd you kill felicia?

28:47.493 --> 28:49.193
Oh, so this is how

28:49.195 --> 28:50.794
You're gonna try
and bring me down?

28:50.796 --> 28:53.330
Frame me for
a made-up murder?

28:53.332 --> 28:56.467
You wish you were
that important.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.035
Look at me.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.080
All right.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.049
Everybody you were
with last night.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.283
Everyone.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.823
(platt)
seriously,
just tell me what it is.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.158
(will)
let me see.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.963
- Does that hurt?
- A little bit.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.031
- Okay.
- Free medical advice, sergeant?

29:28.033 --> 29:30.834
They'll charge me, like,
a $400 deductible

29:30.836 --> 29:32.369
Just to go into
the clinic near me.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.837
It's okay, come on.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.172
Um...

29:37.042 --> 29:38.542
- Oh, god.
- What?

29:41.147 --> 29:43.080
It's a dermahematoma.

29:43.082 --> 29:46.216
What's that?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.951
You need to go to
the hospital immediately.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.319
What?

29:49.321 --> 29:51.088
Is your car nearby?

29:51.090 --> 29:52.523
Should i drive?

29:52.525 --> 29:54.024
I'm just kidding.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.492
It's a hickey.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.497
Just rub
some aloe vera on it.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.232
You should be fine.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.071
Great.

30:08.073 --> 30:09.139
Thanks for that, thanks.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.841
Sorry.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.843
How's new york?

30:12.845 --> 30:14.478
Good.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.146
Just needed
a little breather.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.147
From what?

30:17.149 --> 30:19.149
From vip booths
and models?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.417
What's the real reason?

30:20.419 --> 30:23.020
When did you become
such a cynic?

30:23.022 --> 30:24.488
Oh, what,
i can't take a vacation,

30:24.490 --> 30:28.492
Come back and hang
with my older brother?

30:28.494 --> 30:29.493
So...

30:29.495 --> 30:30.861
- Which one is she?
- Don't.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.029
No, just nod your head.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.965
(will)
i mean, they're both hot.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.100
Or is it that desk sergeant
from downstairs?

30:37.102 --> 30:39.236
Yes, we're on
the backburner right now.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.370
Aw.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.405
Where you staying?

30:41.407 --> 30:43.373
Dad's?

30:43.375 --> 30:45.242
I was thinking
your place.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.078
All right, i'm pretty
deep in a case right now,

30:48.080 --> 30:49.980
So take a cab.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.448
We'll get some food later
or something, all right?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.549
Shut up, here she comes.

30:52.551 --> 30:53.550
Okay.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.552
Okay.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.588
Lindsay, this is
my brother will.

30:57.590 --> 30:58.989
The surgeon.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.090
Most days, yeah.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.325
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.126
How long you in town?

31:03.128 --> 31:04.995
Still figuring that out.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.231
We should all hang out
sometime before you go.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.232
[phone vibrating]
definitely.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.499
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.468
Um, i got to go.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.170
I'll get at you later.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.171
All right.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.039
- See you around.
- See ya.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.910
I met someone
from your family.

31:19.912 --> 31:23.146
I didn't think that'd
be a big deal to you.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.215
Jay, just because i don't
want to lose my job

31:25.217 --> 31:27.651
Doesn't mean i don't
care about you.

31:27.653 --> 31:32.022
That's not gonna change.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.223
Me too.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.000
You need a hug, kid?

31:48.908 --> 31:49.973
Two minutes, you know?

31:49.975 --> 31:51.108
I'm there
two minutes earlier,

31:51.110 --> 31:52.542
This girl's still alive.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.011
I can't stop
thinking about it.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.545
It's killing me.

31:55.547 --> 31:58.949
Listen, man,
we catch this guy or not,

31:58.951 --> 32:03.654
What matters is
what you're feeling right now.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.122
When you hit 20 years
on this job,

32:05.124 --> 32:06.990
That's what'll get you
to 25.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.260
(mouse)
okay.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.129
We ran all
the black grid members

32:12.131 --> 32:13.997
In the cage through
the analytical software

32:13.999 --> 32:15.399
To try and get a match
on that blackmail email.

32:15.401 --> 32:18.568
I checked cell data networks,
vpns, protocols.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.670
- I even ran--
- you got the guy or not?

32:19.672 --> 32:21.071
No.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.639
What about rutowski?

32:22.641 --> 32:24.074
Four of his friends
alibi him out.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.642
They say they were
with him last night.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.711
(hank)
yeah, they're all probably
stoned out of their minds.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.797
- We keep rutowski in custody.
- [stammering]

32:30.798 --> 32:32.214
Sergeant, me and jay,
we got an idea.

32:32.217 --> 32:34.051
See, we was in
the helmand province,

32:34.053 --> 32:35.285
Way the hell
up in the mountains.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.653
It was me and jay
and rev,

32:36.655 --> 32:38.388
And sticks, the guy
with the skull tattoo

32:38.390 --> 32:39.523
On his forearm, and--

32:39.525 --> 32:41.725
(hank)
mouse, shut up.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.360
Halstead, what's the idea?

32:43.362 --> 32:45.562
Guy in our unit was
being held for ransom,

32:45.564 --> 32:47.497
So we staged an exchange
with the kidnappers.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.532
It's mostly classified.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.033
Long story short,
we got him back.

32:50.035 --> 32:51.201
We didn't spend a dime.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.536
(mouse)
we got sosa's phone,

32:52.538 --> 32:54.972
So i can send a message from
his email pretending to be him.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.139
Say he doesn't want
a paper trail,

32:56.141 --> 32:57.474
So he's gonna send
one of his drivers

32:57.476 --> 33:00.410
To deliver the $200,000
in cash, in person.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.312
We just wait
to see who shows up.

33:07.553 --> 33:10.687
All right, sign $200,000
out of the 1505 funds.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.289
Write up an ops plan
for fischer.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.125
Just tell him
we need it for flash.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.360
This is you.

33:34.646 --> 33:37.714
[motorcycle approaching]

33:45.557 --> 33:47.724
Show me your hands.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.159
I'm unarmed.

33:49.161 --> 33:50.627
Let me see it.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.663
$200,000.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.599
Untraceable,
small bills.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.101
All yours
for the original footage.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.806
There it is,
no other copies.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.677
The money.

34:08.746 --> 34:09.813
All right, exchange is made.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.047
Move in.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.516
(hank)
remember he's armed.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.455
What the hell?

34:21.726 --> 34:23.126
Hey!

34:23.128 --> 34:25.295
[panting]

34:28.667 --> 34:30.067
Watch it!

34:31.103 --> 34:32.168
[screams]

34:33.472 --> 34:34.538
[yelps]

34:36.408 --> 34:37.474
[shrieks]

34:51.156 --> 34:52.621
[horn blaring]

34:55.494 --> 34:57.494
[tires screeching]

34:57.496 --> 34:58.695
[both grunting]

35:02.534 --> 35:03.834
Stay down.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.638
This is the pope.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.307
He's a member
of the black grid.

35:13.812 --> 35:17.147
I didn't sleep with him
so you could get rich.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.415
(the pope)
keep your voice down.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.683
You lied to me!

35:19.685 --> 35:21.418
Who are you talking to?

35:21.420 --> 35:22.752
Give it here.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.767
I didn't kill sierra.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.603
Her name was felicia.

35:39.605 --> 35:40.604
She slipped.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.339
It was an accident.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.342
Someone slipping
in the shower is an accident.

35:45.344 --> 35:49.446
Felicia was thrown out
a 20-story window.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.515
She fought back tough,
didn't she?

35:51.517 --> 35:52.782
If you say so.

35:52.784 --> 35:54.851
Actually, the medical
examiner will.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.556
You figured you'd get sosa
on video having sex.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.158
Ruins his reputation,
right?

36:01.160 --> 36:02.759
He pays up, right?

36:02.761 --> 36:05.162
What if i told you
it was sierra's idea?

36:05.164 --> 36:06.563
Her name is felicia.

36:06.565 --> 36:10.834
I'm not telling you that again.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.170
We had an argument.

36:13.172 --> 36:15.172
Yeah.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.807
But she was high
on xanax, and she fell.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.209
Yeah, she was high.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.277
She was high
because she knew

36:20.279 --> 36:21.411
She had to go
through something

36:21.413 --> 36:23.880
She wasn't comfortable
with, right?

36:23.882 --> 36:25.315
But she did it
for the cause.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.284
No, man.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.887
Her idea.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.757
She wanted to trap this dude
and blackmail him.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.693
(the pope)
she and i were just
arguing over my cut.

36:36.695 --> 36:40.363
She started tripping out,
attacked me.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.751
And she started crying.

36:44.752 --> 36:46.969
And boom, a header
right through the window.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.705
You pushed her.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.974
Then you decided
to go ahead with your plan,

36:50.976 --> 36:53.510
And you sent that video
from rutowski's house

36:53.512 --> 36:56.813
To cover your tracks
and frame his ass.

36:56.815 --> 37:00.483
Sierra jumped on her own.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.385
You say her real name.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.723
Say her real name.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.325
Say it.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.293
Say it!

37:10.295 --> 37:11.461
(adam)
say felicia.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.696
Huh?
Try it.

37:12.698 --> 37:13.863
Felicia.

37:13.865 --> 37:14.965
Felicia!

37:14.967 --> 37:15.966
Fine.

37:15.968 --> 37:17.801
Felicia.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.337
But i didn't do anything.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.344
Hey.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.447
You're gonna tell me
what you did to that girl.

37:30.449 --> 37:33.483
You're gonna tell me.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.719
You understand?

37:35.721 --> 37:36.920
Or i swear to god,

37:36.922 --> 37:39.656
I'm gonna take you
for a drive.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.524
I'm the only one
coming back.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.428
She did it
for the cause.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.609
You're right.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.314
But i figured,

38:04.316 --> 38:05.715
I might as well
make a little money

38:05.717 --> 38:07.951
While we're at it.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.453
And i told her
i would split it with her.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.022
But she wouldn't
listen to me.

38:12.024 --> 38:14.858
She said she was
gonna call the cops.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.899
I didn't mean
to push her that hard.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.778
Hey.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.879
Hey.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.480
So i heard that
you just happened--

38:55.667 --> 38:59.536
There's a memorial service
for felicia hughes tomorrow.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.471
I don't know about that,
i think all i want to do

39:01.473 --> 39:04.974
Is come over to your place
and order some food,

39:04.976 --> 39:06.676
Take, like, a week off.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.782
Adam, you should go.

40:14.946 --> 40:15.979
Hey, man.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.747
(will)
yo.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.753
What happened?

40:23.755 --> 40:24.988
Hm.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.990
I might not have
told you everything

40:26.992 --> 40:28.758
About why i left new york.
