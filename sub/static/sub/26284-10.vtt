00:02.253 --> 00:03.921
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:04.005 --> 00:06.799
- Paige?
- I'm so happy to see you.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.217
Are you happy to see me?

00:08.300 --> 00:10.261
Not immediately.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.513
I don't usually see young people
at my lectures.

00:12.596 --> 00:15.391
I enjoyed your paper on
accelerator mass spectrometry

00:15.474 --> 00:16.851
and wanted to find out more.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.437
- And you?
- I read this magazine.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.856
- Uh-huh.
- It has puzzles, too.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.899
Well, I think my parents
are getting a divorce.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.485
- Why?
- They fight all the time.

00:26.569 --> 00:29.405
- I guess I'm lucky.
- Why?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.283
I'm the glue that holds
our family together.

00:40.249 --> 00:43.127
What do you think of these?

00:43.210 --> 00:45.296
They're nice, but you're
already taller than John.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.630
Won't they make that worse?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.674
No, makes it better.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.384
He likes me to be dominating.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.344
I don't want to hear that.

00:52.428 --> 00:56.682
Sometimes he makes me wear these
when we're... messing around.

00:56.766 --> 00:58.976
I said I don't
want to hear it.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.353
I wanted to say it.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.565
All right, I don't have the
Sperry loafers in your size,

01:04.647 --> 01:06.859
but I do have the Hush Puppies.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.236
I don't wear brown
Hush Puppies penny loafers.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.572
I wear brown Sperry
penny loafers.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.675
- But they're exactly the same.
- Well, do they come

01:13.699 --> 01:15.451
in a box that says
Sperry penny loafers?

01:15.534 --> 01:17.036
Because that one
says Hush Puppies.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.579
Just try 'em on, honey.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.957
- What if I like them?
- Well, then we'll get them.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.335
All right, let's go
over this again.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.504
I don't wear brown Hush
Puppies penny loafers,

01:26.587 --> 01:27.963
I wear brown Sperry...

01:28.047 --> 01:29.298
Would you give us a moment?

01:29.381 --> 01:31.217
Happily.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.260
When we get to
the Hello Kitty store today,

01:33.344 --> 01:35.304
remember I was the good child.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.847
Oh, hi, Mary.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.933
Linda. So good to see you.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.185
- Hi, Sheldon.
- Hello, Paige.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.062
- Hi, Missy.
- Hi!

01:43.145 --> 01:45.731
Look at these rain boots...
they have ducks on them.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.650
And the ducks
are wearing boots.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.610
Those are so cute.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.863
- Well, what a nice coincidence.
- Yeah.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.074
- Good to see you.
- Yeah. How are things?

01:55.157 --> 01:56.200
Well, at the moment,

01:56.283 --> 01:57.785
trying to get shoes for Sheldon,

01:57.868 --> 02:01.288
but they only have these,
not the ones he likes.

02:01.372 --> 02:06.794
Ah. You know, I think that brand
is the same kind Einstein wore.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.547
Well, I've never seen a picture
of his feet.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.258
And you're a grown-up,
so you wouldn't lie to me.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.136
I guess I have no choice
but to believe you.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.429
All right, I'll try them.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.224
Great!

02:20.307 --> 02:23.310
Hey, Mom, can Missy and I go
to the Hello Kitty store?

02:23.394 --> 02:25.688
Well, it's okay with me
if it's okay with Mary.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.566
It's okay, but you better be
on your best behavior.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.942
I will, I promise.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.610
Go ahead.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.863
Boy, you steal
one pencil sharpener

02:33.946 --> 02:35.739
and you never hear
the end of it.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.785
How do they feel?

02:39.869 --> 02:43.497
My brand loyalty is being
severely tested.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.377
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

02:48.460 --> 02:51.130
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

02:51.213 --> 02:53.757
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

02:53.841 --> 02:56.093
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

02:56.177 --> 03:00.472
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪♪</i>

03:06.937 --> 03:09.732
Did you guys know Paige
speaks three languages?

03:09.815 --> 03:12.443
Really?
That's impressive.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.987
You only speak one.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.740
Two. I'm learning
conversational Klingon.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.283
That's impressive, too.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.579
Hey, Mom, can Paige
sleep over this weekend?

03:23.662 --> 03:25.956
I guess,
if her mother says okay.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.209
Wait, where is she
going to sleep?

03:28.292 --> 03:30.169
In your bed.
You can sleep on the couch.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.545
Absolutely not.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.505
I've already changed
my brand of loafers.

03:33.589 --> 03:36.759
I am not changing
my sleeping quarters.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.844
How about you stay at
Meemaw's? You like that.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.888
No, Meemaw has a date.

03:40.971 --> 03:41.971
So?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.515
So if those shoes I just bought

03:43.599 --> 03:44.599
do their job,

03:44.642 --> 03:46.810
that will be a "no children
allowed" scenario.

03:48.103 --> 03:51.148
Well, I'm sleeping in my bed,
and that's that.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.275
Fine. Paige and I
can share my bed.

03:53.359 --> 03:54.985
You okay with that, Shelly?

03:56.445 --> 03:58.864
I trust you two will stay quiet
throughout the evening

03:58.948 --> 04:00.741
and go to sleep at
the appropriate time?

04:01.784 --> 04:03.244
Absolutely.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.955
All right, then.
I'm okay with it, Mom.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.833
How is he ever gonna
get through this world?

04:13.712 --> 04:14.922
Welcome, come on in.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.632
Oh, thank you.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.551
You look nice. Going out
to dinner with your husband?

04:19.635 --> 04:21.262
Ugh, no. Girlfriends.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.554
Hi, Sheldon.

04:22.638 --> 04:23.973
Hello.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.099
What are you doing?

04:25.182 --> 04:27.059
Chemistry homework
for extra credit.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.894
Cute. I did that last year.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.646
Paige!

04:30.729 --> 04:31.855
Missy!

04:32.648 --> 04:34.817
Aw, they're so sweet.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.529
Yeah, life'll suck that
right out of them soon enough.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.155
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.033
You gotta meet my dolls...
I told them all about you!

04:45.995 --> 04:49.331
"Cute. I did that last year."

04:49.415 --> 04:51.625
Thank you for agreeing
to the early-bird dinner.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.713
When I eat too late,
the food just sits right here.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.215
Yeah, gettin' old is no party.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.593
Oh, I've had this problem
since I was ten.

05:01.677 --> 05:06.390
When I was in grade school,
my nickname was Old Burpy.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.059
Well, I will not be
calling you that.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.436
You can if you'd like.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.895
I'm good.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.606
So, I have a little surprise
for you.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.775
Oh, I love surprises.
Whatcha got?

05:16.859 --> 05:18.652
I'm going to learn to drive.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.362
Really?

05:20.446 --> 05:21.572
Yes.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.200
While I love having you be
the dominant personality

05:25.284 --> 05:28.579
behind closed doors,
I think out in public

05:28.662 --> 05:30.873
I ought to take on
more of a macho role.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.918
Well, you're macho enough
for me, John,

05:35.002 --> 05:38.255
but I would enjoy not having
to drive us all the time.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.506
Then it's settled.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.175
Well, when do you start?

05:41.258 --> 05:42.926
As soon as you teach me.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.930
Me? Do you really think
that's a good idea?

05:47.014 --> 05:50.267
It's perfect.
I teach you about science

05:50.351 --> 05:51.935
so you can impress
your grandson,

05:52.019 --> 05:55.981
and you teach me to drive
so I can impress you.

05:56.065 --> 06:00.986
Okay, but if we do this,
I'm in charge.

06:01.070 --> 06:05.574
You have to do what I say when
and how I tell you to do it.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.869
Hubba-hubba, it's like
we're back in the bedroom.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.666
Did you know that tea was
discovered by accident?

06:14.750 --> 06:17.252
I didn't, but I don't know
lots of stuff.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.297
The Emperor Shennong of China
was boiling water in his garden

06:20.381 --> 06:22.424
and a leaf from a tea tree
fell into his pot.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.802
Tea comes from trees?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.096
Where'd you think
it comes from?

06:27.179 --> 06:28.806
The supermarket.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.286
What, did the girls leave you out
of their little picnic?

06:33.310 --> 06:34.895
Oh, they invited him.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.247
Well, then why ain't you
out there?

06:36.271 --> 06:39.316
Eat outdoors? Do I look
like a hippie to you?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.110
I thought Paige
was your friend.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.861
She's more of a colleague.

06:42.945 --> 06:43.946
Oh.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.322
Although for reasons unknown,

06:45.406 --> 06:47.574
she's currently behaving
like a ten-year-old.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.910
Maybe that's because
she is a ten-year-old.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.245
Still no excuse.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.207
All right, I'm just gonna
come out and ask it:

06:55.290 --> 06:57.543
what the heck
is a colleague?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.468
Okay, pick a number.

07:06.552 --> 07:07.594
Three.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.430
One, two, three.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.931
Now pick a color.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.266
Pink, duh.

07:13.016 --> 07:17.020
The name of
your future pony is...

07:17.104 --> 07:18.981
Sparkle Sunshine.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.233
I would totally name it that!

07:21.316 --> 07:23.902
Sheldon, do you want to
have your fortune read?

07:24.445 --> 07:25.779
Absolutely not.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.824
And I cannot believe a person
as smart as you is doing it.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.909
Why? It's fun.

07:31.452 --> 07:34.371
He doesn't know how to have fun.
He's an old man.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.747
I'm not an old man.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.916
Oh, yeah?
What's your favorite color?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.334
Khaki.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.503
Old man.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.263
I'm trying to sleep.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.432
Come inside and play with us.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.600
Don't invite him.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.684
This is a girls' fort,

07:55.767 --> 07:57.227
not an old man fort.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.521
I'm not an old man.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.814
Then come inside.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.816
Are you crazy? It's bedtime.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.694
Old man.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.924
What are you doing?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.134
We're tying
Georgie's ankles together.

08:29.218 --> 08:32.011
So when he gets
out of bed he falls down.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.554
But he could get hurt.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.140
If we're lucky.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.476
Well, I will not be
a party to this.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.144
Old man.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.652
That's when
the bloodthirsty Goatman...

08:46.735 --> 08:49.238
part goat, part man...

08:49.321 --> 08:53.367
- crept up on the sleeping children...
- No.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.120
...and sank his sharp little
teeth into their necks...

08:57.204 --> 09:00.290
- No.
- ...and drank their blood!

09:00.374 --> 09:01.875
No.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.502
Problem?

09:03.585 --> 09:05.796
Several. First of all,
goats are herbivores.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.006
They don't eat meat,
let alone drink blood.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.175
Maybe the half man part
drinks blood.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.470
Don't even get me started
on the "half man" stuff.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.974
Sheldon, it's just
a fun scary story.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.809
It's nonsense, is what it is.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.018
Old man.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.853
I'm not an old man. I'm ten.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.522
More like 110.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.900
You know, I read that adults
who had a stunted childhood

09:26.984 --> 09:29.528
often become social misfits
and weirdos.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.363
You didn't read that,
you're making it up

09:31.446 --> 09:32.781
like your goat story.

09:32.864 --> 09:37.119
<i>Psychology Magazine,</i>
February issue, 1988.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.495
Well, um...

09:38.579 --> 09:40.998
that doesn't make it true.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.761
Guess you'll find out
when you're an adult.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.710
I guess I will.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.965
<i>Well, we know
how this story ends.</i>

09:50.048 --> 09:51.925
<i>I grew up to become
a well-adjusted</i>

09:52.009 --> 09:53.927
<i>and charming fellow.
But at that moment in time,</i>

09:54.011 --> 09:55.512
<i>she had me worried.</i>

09:55.596 --> 10:00.058
<i>Hey, Georgie, breakfast.
Mom made Eggos.</i>

10:00.142 --> 10:02.102
<i>Eggos, sweet.</i>

10:02.185 --> 10:04.313
<i>Ow! Dang it!</i>

10:13.697 --> 10:15.741
- Oh, dear.
- What?

10:15.824 --> 10:17.326
Paige was right.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.453
"There's ample evidence
to indicate

10:19.536 --> 10:22.581
that a stunted childhood
can cause one to be maladjusted

10:22.664 --> 10:23.790
as an adult."

10:23.874 --> 10:25.083
Then I'm screwed.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.793
What do you mean?

10:26.877 --> 10:29.421
When I'm not in school,
I'm doing homework.

10:29.504 --> 10:32.215
When I'm not doing homework,
I'm practicing my cello.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.634
And when I'm not doing that,

10:33.717 --> 10:35.385
I'm working in my parents' store.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.888
That must be why we're friends.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.181
We're both stunted.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.599
Sounds right.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.602
Well, I for one
plan to do something about it.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.437
Like what?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.440
I'm going to goof off,
engage in horseplay,

10:48.523 --> 10:50.692
and if time permits,
be quite immature.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.069
If time permits?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.403
I have homework, too.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.448
Would you like to join me
in my shenanigans?

10:56.531 --> 10:57.824
No, thanks.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.328
Aren't you concerned about
being a maladjusted adult?

11:01.411 --> 11:04.039
Nah. I'll just marry
an American woman

11:04.122 --> 11:06.333
and hope she can fix me.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.965
I'm usually the one
giving the tests,

11:14.049 --> 11:17.135
but, uh, today I'm taking one.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.470
No talking.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.974
And I usually say that
to my students.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.187
What?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.232
How's it going?

11:30.315 --> 11:33.235
I can't tell you.
There's no talking.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.362
- No talking.
- Sorry.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.123
- Mind if I join you?
- Doing what?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.500
- Swinging.
- Seriously?

11:48.583 --> 11:51.294
Yes. It's my hope to feel
the wind in my hair

11:51.378 --> 11:52.462
and be carefree.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.755
Um, okay.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.856
Sheldon threw up on me.
Sheldon threw up on me!

12:13.191 --> 12:15.986
Okay, rearview mirrors.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.321
Um, all set.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.033
Turn signal left.
Turn signal right.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.786
Um, foot on the brake.

12:24.870 --> 12:28.290
Transmission in drive.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.088
You have to start
the car first.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.215
Of course.

12:37.299 --> 12:38.675
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.427
You're not alone.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.016
And here we go.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.440
This is crazy.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.817
I'm doing it.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.539
Excuse me.
I was hoping to purchase

13:09.623 --> 13:11.541
some practical joke
paraphernalia

13:11.625 --> 13:13.543
so that I may behave
childishly.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.961
Rack in the corner.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.254
Thank you.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.564
"If it's funny, it's a Bazinga."

13:34.648 --> 13:35.941
Interesting.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.658
Yellow light!
Yellow light!

13:44.741 --> 13:45.992
It's okay, keep going.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.494
But yellow means slow down.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.721
You can't slow down
in the intersection!

13:48.745 --> 13:50.247
Keep going.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.873
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

13:51.957 --> 13:52.958
Go! Go!

14:02.259 --> 14:05.887
Oh, God. Oh, God.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.389
Oh...

14:07.472 --> 14:08.765
I'm so sorry.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.725
It's okay, we're fine.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.352
Nobody got hurt.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.187
I don't think I can
do this, Connie.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.439
Of course you can.
We're just getting started.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.693
No, it's too much information.
I can't process it.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.653
It was just a yellow light.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.906
Not just the light.
There were other cars.

14:24.990 --> 14:25.991
There's pedestrians.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.577
- There was a guy on a bicycle.
- So?

14:28.660 --> 14:30.370
That's just too many
random elements.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.039
The... the... the stimuli
are overwhelming.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.625
Okay. Okay.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.172
I'm sorry.
I know I'm letting you down.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.050
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not letting me down.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.139
I love you whether
you can drive or not.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.726
You love me?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
Well, I...

14:58.773 --> 15:00.734
I suppose I do.

15:00.817 --> 15:05.572
Am I allowed
to reciprocate?

15:05.655 --> 15:09.075
Sure, if that's
the way you feel.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.036
Oh, it is.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.413
I love you, too, Connie.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.416
Well...

15:19.294 --> 15:21.004
That's just great.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.757
All righty.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.302
Would you like
to switch seats with me?

15:27.385 --> 15:29.846
Yes, but give me a minute

15:29.930 --> 15:32.682
because my legs
are a little wobbly.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.727
Is that from the yellow light
or the "I love yous"?

15:35.810 --> 15:37.020
Both.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.985
Dad, would you care
for a piece of gum?

15:44.069 --> 15:45.403
No, thank you.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.155
Please, take the piece of gum.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.448
Why?

15:48.531 --> 15:49.824
Just please.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.829
Bazinga.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.166
You understand any of that?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.794
I don't know. I guess
he's just being a little boy.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.545
Since when?

16:02.629 --> 16:05.590
<i>Georgie? Georgie?</i>

16:05.674 --> 16:06.800
What?

16:07.884 --> 16:11.137
Would you like some
salted mixed nuts?

16:11.221 --> 16:12.221
Nah.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.890
Look, they're the fancy kind.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.433
That's a trick can.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.935
No, it's not.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.104
Listen. When you shake it,
there's a rattling sound,

16:19.187 --> 16:20.605
as if nuts are inside.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.985
Fine.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.281
Bazinga.

16:32.867 --> 16:35.161
Sparks residence,
Billy speaking.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.746
<i>This is the electric company.</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:37.831
Hello.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.417
I'm calling to see
if your refrigerator is running.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.168
I'll go check.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.966
I'm back. It's running.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.051
Well, then you better
go catch it.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.804
<i>Bazinga.</i>

16:54.681 --> 16:56.266
<i>This is Connie Tucker.</i>

16:56.349 --> 16:59.227
<i>Leave a message
when you hear the... beep.</i>

17:00.854 --> 17:03.773
<i>Hello, um, Meemaw,</i>

17:03.857 --> 17:05.025
<i>this is Sheldon.</i>

17:05.108 --> 17:09.487
<i>If you were home, I was going
to say, "Is Mr. Wall there?"</i>

17:09.570 --> 17:10.989
<i>And then you would say, "No."</i>

17:11.071 --> 17:14.034
<i>And then I would say,
"Is Mrs. Wall there?"</i>

17:14.117 --> 17:15.910
<i>And then you would say, "No."</i>

17:15.993 --> 17:18.038
<i>And then I would say,
"Well, if there are no walls,</i>

17:18.121 --> 17:20.498
<i>then how does your roof
stay up?"</i>

17:21.207 --> 17:24.252
Um, okay. Bazinga.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.672
That was pathetic.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.632
It was.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.303
I'm not sure I'm cut out
for these antics and shenanigans.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.764
I guess you're gonna
grow up to be a weirdo.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.058
I suppose I am.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.393
Life is so confusing.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.354
I always hoped
it would be easier for me

17:43.438 --> 17:44.898
when I grew up, but...

17:46.816 --> 17:49.110
...now I'm not so sure it will.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.404
It's gonna be all right.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.038
You were faking?

18:02.665 --> 18:04.584
Bazinga.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.377
<i>And that's how I became</i>

18:06.461 --> 18:10.006
<i>the madcap prankster
all my friends know and love.</i>

18:15.887 --> 18:19.057
So, John, how was
your first driving lesson?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.017
Intense.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.268
At one point,

18:22.352 --> 18:24.354
I was approaching
an intersection.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.440
The light was green,
but at the last moment,

18:27.524 --> 18:28.525
it turned yellow.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.818
I didn't know what to do.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.487
Should I keep going?
Should I stop?

18:32.570 --> 18:34.656
There were
other cars nearby.

18:34.739 --> 18:35.949
Connie was yelling.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.451
A glare from the sun
was in my eyes.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.744
So, what happened?

18:39.828 --> 18:42.038
Somehow, I managed
to make it through,

18:42.122 --> 18:43.706
turned on my directional,

18:44.332 --> 18:47.502
and slowly pulled
to the side of the road.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.381
That's how you
tell a scary story.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.426
In lighter news,
your meemaw loves me.
