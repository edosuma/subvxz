00:03.820 --> 00:05.981
Oh, boy.

00:07.190 --> 00:08.214
What?

00:08.391 --> 00:13.328
I can't comment without violating our
agreement that I not criticize your work.

00:13.496 --> 00:18.490
- Then what was "Oh, boy"?
- Great restraint on my part.

00:18.902 --> 00:21.097
There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

00:21.271 --> 00:25.833
Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say "science."

00:32.716 --> 00:33.944
Okay, how's that?

00:34.350 --> 00:36.716
You actually had it right
in the first place.

00:38.121 --> 00:42.182
Once again, you've fallen
for one of my classic pranks.

00:42.358 --> 00:43.586
Buzzinga.

00:49.032 --> 00:51.159
Well, now, here's a peculiar e-mail.

00:51.334 --> 00:55.430
The president of the university wants me
to meet him at his office at 8 a.m.

00:55.605 --> 00:58.665
- Why?
- Doesn't say. Must be an emergency.

00:58.842 --> 01:01.504
Everyone at the university knows
I eat breakfast at 8...

01:01.678 --> 01:03.942
...and move my bowels at 8:20.

01:05.114 --> 01:08.175
Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

01:09.986 --> 01:12.386
I guess you'll find out what it is
in the morning.

01:12.555 --> 01:14.216
That's 14 hours away.

01:14.390 --> 01:18.349
For the next 840 minutes, I'm effectively
one of Heisenberg's particles.

01:18.528 --> 01:21.656
I know where I am or how fast I'm going,
but I can't know both.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.731
Yet how am I supposed to carry on...

01:23.900 --> 01:26.801
...with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

01:27.270 --> 01:28.669
Yeah, I know the feeling.

01:59.469 --> 02:01.494
Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

02:01.671 --> 02:05.038
Why does everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

02:05.208 --> 02:08.074
- Everybody?
- You, the president of the university...

02:08.244 --> 02:10.405
...his wife,
their sullen teenage daughter.

02:10.580 --> 02:16.485
That entire family is fascinated by what
time it is and whether people know it.

02:16.686 --> 02:19.712
You went to President Seibert's house
in the middle of the night?

02:19.889 --> 02:22.824
He didn't respond to my e-mail,
his phone number is unlisted.

02:22.992 --> 02:25.392
Tell me what my other option was.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.860
You could have waited until morning.

02:28.031 --> 02:30.761
I know, look who I'm talking to.

02:32.001 --> 02:35.698
Remember the grant proposal I submitted
to the National Science Foundation...

02:35.872 --> 02:38.864
...to detect slow-moving monopoles
at the magnetic north pole?

02:39.042 --> 02:42.603
Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

02:42.846 --> 02:44.279
Oh, how nice.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.846
Well, a space opened up
at the last minute...

02:47.016 --> 02:50.383
...on the NSF expedition
to the Arctic Circle.

02:50.553 --> 02:52.111
Wait a minute.

02:52.355 --> 02:53.982
[TOILET FLUSHES]

02:55.225 --> 02:57.193
He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

02:57.360 --> 03:00.022
Yes.
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

03:00.530 --> 03:03.988
He said, "Frankly,
if I could send you tonight, I would."

03:05.802 --> 03:07.861
Okay. Well, do you wanna go?

03:08.037 --> 03:10.767
Of course not.
I'm a theoretical physicist.

03:10.940 --> 03:14.808
A career I chose in no small part
because it's indoors.

03:15.411 --> 03:18.938
But if I'm able to detect slow-moving
magnetic monopoles there...

03:19.115 --> 03:21.777
...I will be the scientist
who confirmed string theory.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.885
And people will write books about me.

03:24.053 --> 03:29.286
Third graders will create macaroni-art
dioramas depicting scenes from my life.

03:29.893 --> 03:33.954
Sure. Maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

03:34.764 --> 03:36.459
Sarcasm?

03:36.633 --> 03:38.328
Maybe.

03:39.235 --> 03:41.294
I am on the horns of a dilemma.

03:41.471 --> 03:45.464
Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper,
at the North Pole?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.610
Easy peasy. I'm doing it right now.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.813
I'm not good with cold, Leonard.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.312
How often have we had to leave
a movie theater...

03:53.483 --> 03:56.850
...because I got a headache
from drinking the Icee too fast?

03:57.120 --> 03:59.111
- I can't go.
- Then don't go.

03:59.289 --> 04:03.692
How can you say that? The scientific
opportunity of a lifetime presents itself...

04:03.860 --> 04:06.021
...my best friend says, "Don't go."

04:06.195 --> 04:09.255
- All right, then go.
- Listen to you.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.358
How can I possibly go?

04:13.569 --> 04:15.298
What are the words I can say now...

04:15.471 --> 04:18.132
...to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

04:18.641 --> 04:23.601
Odd. President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

04:24.948 --> 04:26.176
How was it resolved?

04:26.349 --> 04:30.809
It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.885
Just imagine. If he says yes...

04:35.091 --> 04:38.652
...we'll have an entire summer
without Sheldon.

04:39.629 --> 04:41.995
We could play outside.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.793
We could sit
on the left side of the couch.

04:45.969 --> 04:48.665
I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

04:52.608 --> 04:55.304
Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

04:57.313 --> 05:00.840
Good news, gentlemen.
I have tentatively accepted--

05:01.050 --> 05:02.915
ALL:
Yeah!

05:06.990 --> 05:09.891
--the invitation
to join the Arctic expedition.

05:10.326 --> 05:13.489
- It's not gonna be the same without you.
- We're gonna miss you.

05:13.663 --> 05:17.155
Thank you,
but your sentiments may be premature.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.733
Oh, I don't like where this is going.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.870
I would like to propose...

05:22.772 --> 05:25.172
...that the three of you
accompany me.

05:25.341 --> 05:28.936
- To the North Pole?
- Yes.

05:29.145 --> 05:32.273
Is this just so we won't touch your stuff
while you're away?

05:33.916 --> 05:36.248
I'll admit that was a concern.

05:36.419 --> 05:41.083
But the fact is, I'll need a support team
and the three of you are my first choice.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.885
- Really?
- Others might be more qualified...

05:44.060 --> 05:47.188
...but the thought of interviewing them
gave me a stomachache.

05:48.031 --> 05:50.397
I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking...

05:50.566 --> 05:53.592
...so why don't you take a few moments
to discuss it?

05:55.538 --> 05:58.473
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

05:58.674 --> 06:01.108
SHELDON:
I'm still within earshot.

06:01.577 --> 06:04.546
You may wanna wait
for my door to close.

06:04.714 --> 06:05.738
[DOOR CLOSES]

06:05.948 --> 06:09.042
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

06:09.218 --> 06:13.120
Hang on, let's talk about it. This is a
National Science Foundation expedition.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.257
I don't know
how we can turn it down.

06:15.425 --> 06:19.418
Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't
wanna go on an NSF expedition," say:

06:19.595 --> 06:23.224
"No, we don't wanna spend three months
stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle...

06:23.399 --> 06:25.458
...with an anal nutbag."

06:26.102 --> 06:29.435
But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory...

06:29.605 --> 06:32.938
...we could drink for free in any bar,
in any college town...

06:33.109 --> 06:37.011
...with a university
that has a strong science program.

06:37.580 --> 06:40.276
Howard, this is big science.
You could be the engineer...

06:40.450 --> 06:43.647
...who builds the equipment
that puts us on the cover of magazines.

06:43.820 --> 06:48.848
I could also be the engineer who builds
the crossbow that kills Sheldon.

06:52.295 --> 06:54.991
You still might get on a magazine.

06:56.232 --> 06:59.793
- You guys are seriously considering this?
- Yes.

06:59.969 --> 07:03.962
- You think you can put up with Sheldon?
- Well, I'm a Hindu.

07:04.140 --> 07:08.975
My religion teaches that if we suffer
in this life, we are rewarded in the next.

07:09.145 --> 07:11.773
Three months at the North Pole
with Sheldon...

07:11.948 --> 07:15.748
...and I'm reborn
as a well-hung billionaire with wings.

07:22.558 --> 07:25.254
Well, gentlemen,
have you reached a decision?

07:25.962 --> 07:29.056
- I'm in.
- Me too.

07:30.566 --> 07:32.363
Damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

07:34.003 --> 07:37.632
Excellent. And just an FYI,
as I am the expedition's team leader...

07:37.807 --> 07:41.038
...protocol dictates that be phrased,
"Fine, sir."

07:41.210 --> 07:44.338
But don't worry,
there will be a briefing.

could possibly confuse you...

I am going to the Arctic Circle...

of a gnat.

Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

09:01.090 --> 09:03.957
Yeah, I'm just a little surprised
you didn't tell me.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.787
Well, it all happened kind of fast.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.897

and buy thermal underwear...

snow and stuff.

09:13.436 --> 09:16.496
- Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
- No, you don't have to apologize.

09:16.672 --> 09:19.937
There's no reason you have to tell me.
I was just surprised.

09:20.109 --> 09:22.839
You were busy, you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

on the freezer?

I'm gonna stop here while I'm ahead
but I've had a great time.

is to acclimate us to the use of tools...

...in extreme temperatures
such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.661

to bring the equipment we'll be using...

is a goatee without a mustache.

13:23.486 --> 13:25.647
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what the other guys are doing.</i>

13:25.821 --> 13:28.085
<i>If the other guys jumped</i>
<i>in the Bay of Bengal...</i>

13:28.257 --> 13:30.555
<i>...and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,</i>
<i>would you?</i>

13:30.726 --> 13:33.889
If you were standing behind me nagging,
I might.

13:34.430 --> 13:37.729
<i>Don't talk back to your mother.</i>
<i>This trip is much too dangerous.</i>

13:37.900 --> 13:41.063
No, it's not. Howard, tell them.

13:41.370 --> 13:44.999
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste.

13:46.342 --> 13:47.775
I understand you're concerned.

13:47.943 --> 13:51.003
If it'll make you feel better,
my mother is fine with me going.

13:51.180 --> 13:55.776
And this is a woman who kept
a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.

13:55.951 --> 13:59.682
<i>So she has no problem</i>
<i>with her son being eaten by a walrus?</i>

13:59.855 --> 14:01.789
That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali.

14:01.957 --> 14:05.449
If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn...

14:05.661 --> 14:09.461
...or being ripped to shreds
by a 1500-pound polar bear.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.932
Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone
with Raj's parents.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.538
Can you tell them that you're okay
with me going to the Arctic?

14:16.705 --> 14:21.233
MRS. WOLOWITZ [ON SPEAKERPHONE]:
<i>Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas.</i>

14:22.578 --> 14:25.046
I didn't say that.
You never listen to me.

14:25.214 --> 14:26.738
<i>He doesn't tell me anything.</i>

14:26.916 --> 14:31.080
<i>He lives a secret life</i>
<i>because he's ashamed.</i>

14:31.887 --> 14:33.878
Hey, Leonard,
can I talk to you for a sec?

14:34.056 --> 14:38.720
Sure, but let's go out here where
there's a little less yelling and guilt.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.557
What's up?

14:40.729 --> 14:43.061
Well, I got you
a little going-away present.

14:43.232 --> 14:46.429
- Oh, a blanket.
- Oh, no, no. Not just a blanket.

14:46.602 --> 14:49.503
See, it has sleeves.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.131
Yeah.

14:55.945 --> 14:59.847
So you can, you know, be all snoodled
up while you do your science stuff.

15:00.015 --> 15:03.416
Oh, wow. Cool.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.220
I'm gonna miss you.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.922
- See you later.
- Bye.

15:20.769 --> 15:23.636
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALl: <i>I told you no.</i>
<i>Why don't you believe me?</i>

15:23.806 --> 15:26.206
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
<i>Because it doesn't make sense to me.</i>

15:26.375 --> 15:29.344
<i>How can it be</i>
<i>that in the entire country of India...</i>

15:29.511 --> 15:33.174
<i>...there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?</i>

15:38.387 --> 15:40.048
[KNOCKING]

15:40.255 --> 15:41.688
Sheldon.

15:41.857 --> 15:45.349
- Sheldon?
- I want a cookie, Meemaw.

15:47.630 --> 15:51.191
- Sheldon, it's me.
- But Meemaw just made cookies.

15:52.968 --> 15:56.028
Listen, I don't know if I can go
on the expedition.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.504
- What?
- I don't think I can go to the North Pole.

15:59.675 --> 16:04.078
Okay. Leonard, I know you're concerned
about disappointing me...

16:04.279 --> 16:06.907
...I want you to take comfort
from the knowledge...

16:07.082 --> 16:10.518
...that my expectations of you
are very low.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.547
Yeah, that's very comforting.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.417
Comforting is a part of leadership.

16:15.591 --> 16:18.651
It's not a part I care for
but such is my burden.

16:18.827 --> 16:22.524
Terrific. It's just that
I don't think Penny wants me to go.

16:23.032 --> 16:26.832
Assuming that's a valid reason not to go,
which it isn't...

16:27.369 --> 16:30.031
...how do you know this?
Did she say it?

16:30.372 --> 16:31.839
Not exactly.

16:32.007 --> 16:35.204
But she said she was gonna miss me
and she gave me this.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.008
- What is it?
- It's a blanket with sleeves.

16:41.183 --> 16:44.084
Oh, that's clever.

16:46.021 --> 16:47.852
Let me see if I understand this.

16:48.023 --> 16:52.187
Her missing you,
is an emotional state you find desirable.

16:52.861 --> 16:54.522
- Yes, obviously.
- All right.

16:54.697 --> 16:58.531
Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving...

16:58.701 --> 17:02.034
...logic dictates you must leave.

17:02.971 --> 17:06.065
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone
for three months.

17:06.241 --> 17:09.438
What if she doesn't miss me that long
and she meets someone else?

17:10.212 --> 17:13.477
She does have a short attention span.

17:13.648 --> 17:16.482
- So I can't go.
- Leonard, you may be right.

17:16.652 --> 17:19.280
It appears that Penny secretly
wants you in her life...

17:19.454 --> 17:22.049
...in a very intimate
and carnal fashion.

17:23.092 --> 17:25.959
- You really think so?
- Of course not.

17:28.230 --> 17:29.891
Even in my sleep-deprived state...

17:30.065 --> 17:33.660
...l've managed to pull off
another one of my classic pranks.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.998
Buzzinga.

17:43.579 --> 17:46.912
- Oh, Leonard, what time is it?
- Seven a.m. I'm sorry it's early.

17:47.082 --> 17:49.516
But we're leaving soon
and I needed to talk to you.

17:49.685 --> 17:51.084
Okay.

17:51.754 --> 17:54.746
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

17:56.692 --> 18:01.129
I don't know.
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

18:02.831 --> 18:06.892
Okay. Well, what about this?
What does this mean?

18:07.669 --> 18:12.402
Wine, a credit card and late-night
television are a bad combination?

18:13.909 --> 18:14.933
All right, fine.

18:15.110 --> 18:18.307
What about that really long hug?
What did that mean?

18:19.414 --> 18:20.813
That wasn't a long hug.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.945
It was at least five Mississippis.

18:25.621 --> 18:30.456
A standard hug
is two Mississippis, tops.

18:31.927 --> 18:34.919
Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.
It was just a hug.

18:35.964 --> 18:37.864
- Glad we cleared that up.
- Yeah.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.126
- I guess I'll see you.
- Okay.

18:40.302 --> 18:43.032
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

18:43.338 --> 18:44.828
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

18:49.011 --> 18:50.205
[SIGHS]

18:50.379 --> 18:53.143
It means I wish you weren't going.

18:58.854 --> 19:00.845
[WIND HOWLING]

19:03.325 --> 19:05.122
- Damn it.
- What?

19:05.327 --> 19:07.318
We're out of ice.

19:08.430 --> 19:12.264
All right, we begin initial assembly and
deployment of the testing equipment...

19:12.434 --> 19:17.337
...starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,
but until then, you are all off duty.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.272
I suggest you keep the shenanigans
to a minimum...

19:20.442 --> 19:23.775
...as medical help is 18 hours away
by dogsled.

19:24.546 --> 19:27.413
- What are you working on?
- Crossbow.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.079
Hey, guys, can I just say something?

19:32.254 --> 19:35.087
How about we take a moment
to think about where we are?

19:35.257 --> 19:38.090
I mean, this is literally
the top of the world.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.728
Only a handful of people
in all of human history...

19:40.896 --> 19:42.955
...will ever see
what we are going to see.

19:43.999 --> 19:46.160
- He's right.
- Yeah, wow.

19:46.368 --> 19:48.859
It is remarkable.

19:50.138 --> 19:52.299
So who's up for a movie?

19:52.474 --> 19:53.907
Good idea. What do you think?

19:54.076 --> 19:57.307
<i>Ice Station Zebra</i>
or John Carpenter's <i>The Thing?</i>

19:57.479 --> 20:00.414
- I say double feature.
- Dinner's ready.

20:00.649 --> 20:04.176
SHELDON: What are we having?
- Reconstituted Thai food.

20:04.753 --> 20:07.244
Did you bring the dehydrated
low-sodium soy sauce?

20:07.422 --> 20:09.117
- Check.
- Freeze-dried spicy mustard?

20:09.291 --> 20:12.692
- Check.
- And flash-frozen brown rice, not white?

20:12.895 --> 20:16.422
- Uh, oh. Sorry.
- Not to worry.

20:16.598 --> 20:17.622
I hid it.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.096
[LAUGHS]

20:20.302 --> 20:22.031
Buzzinga.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.906
You're in my spot.

20:37.219 --> 20:41.121
There's no time for a crossbow,
find me an icicle.

20:44.192 --> 20:48.185
SHELDON:
Three months. This is gonna be great.
