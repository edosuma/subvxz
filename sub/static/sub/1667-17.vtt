00:00.462 --> 00:01.733
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.734 --> 00:03.672
Dahlia will come here,
drawn by your daughter.

00:03.702 --> 00:05.440
She will kill anyone who would defy her.

00:05.470 --> 00:06.639
Yet you would defy her.

00:06.669 --> 00:08.632
My one chance is to align
with you and kill her.

00:08.662 --> 00:10.637
Should Freya betray us, what if Hope

00:10.667 --> 00:12.090
should be harmed through her actions?

00:12.120 --> 00:14.770
We have to consider every
weapon at our disposal, brother.

00:14.800 --> 00:18.211
The Treme coven wants
Vincent Griffith returned.

00:18.241 --> 00:20.613
(Chanting)

00:20.614 --> 00:21.714
(Gasping)

00:21.715 --> 00:22.714
Who are you?

00:22.715 --> 00:24.049
Elijah: Vincent Griffith is alive and free

00:24.050 --> 00:25.850
from the influence of my brother Finn.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.618
Ruben: A witch named Eva Sinclair was

00:27.619 --> 00:30.167
stealing children to channel their power.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.588
Given that there's a witch
inside me trying to break out,

00:32.589 --> 00:33.783
probably shouldn't be alone right now.

00:33.813 --> 00:34.871
I see Marcel let you out.

00:34.901 --> 00:35.953
I told him what I knew,

00:35.983 --> 00:37.325
but if Eva's coming back here,

00:37.355 --> 00:39.522
I don't want anything to do with her.

00:39.552 --> 00:41.829
Rebekah? Rebekah?

00:42.300 --> 00:43.990
Rebekah: I'm having flashes of memory,

00:44.020 --> 00:46.499
but they fade almost as
soon as I've had them.

00:54.719 --> 00:57.873
Rebekah, voice-over: All of us
live with a demon inside.

00:57.874 --> 00:59.467
Rebekah Mikaelson!

00:59.497 --> 01:01.963
(Thunder)

01:02.851 --> 01:05.296
You can't hide from me forever!

01:07.656 --> 01:10.852
Some days, you control the demon...

01:14.069 --> 01:16.701
This is my house!

01:16.731 --> 01:17.887
Aah!

01:17.917 --> 01:19.823
(Gasps)

01:19.853 --> 01:21.297
You ok?

01:21.327 --> 01:24.500
Rebekah, voice-over:
And other days, it controls you.

01:26.768 --> 01:28.243
(Neck snaps)

01:28.273 --> 01:30.627
And it is always hungry.

01:32.072 --> 01:34.656
It feeds on lust,

01:34.686 --> 01:36.675
on longing.

01:39.945 --> 01:42.778
And while you may slumber,

01:43.076 --> 01:44.980
the demon never sleeps.

01:44.981 --> 01:47.950
(Hope crying)

01:49.407 --> 01:51.705
It tempts you into crossing every line

01:51.735 --> 01:54.488
- you've ever drawn...
- (Crying)

01:57.045 --> 01:59.591
All while it hunts you...

02:02.459 --> 02:04.460
Haunts you...

02:05.230 --> 02:09.282
Renders you incapable of
telling friend from foe...

02:14.115 --> 02:18.508
But once it has turned your
loved ones into enemies,

02:18.992 --> 02:22.326
the demon will have consumed you whole.

02:28.993 --> 02:30.907
Get away from her!

02:32.354 --> 02:34.282
Ugh!

02:37.220 --> 02:38.651
Rebekah, what are you doing?

02:38.652 --> 02:41.453
Agh! Unh!

02:41.454 --> 02:42.586
(Crack)

02:42.587 --> 02:44.304
Aah!

02:44.334 --> 02:45.589
Agh!

02:45.590 --> 02:47.586
Aah!

03:03.270 --> 03:05.096
I should stop packing these away.

03:05.126 --> 03:06.669
There's always one
family member or another

03:06.699 --> 03:08.859
in need of a good shackling.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.939
Find Rebekah or Eva

03:10.969 --> 03:12.597
or whoever the bloody hell that was,

03:12.627 --> 03:14.915
use these to stop her from doing magic,

03:14.945 --> 03:16.830
and don't hurt her.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.680
The non-psychopathic bits
are still my sister.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.981
All right. I won't be the
only one looking for her.

03:22.011 --> 03:23.263
She killed witch kids.

03:23.293 --> 03:24.709
The 24-hour hold that Elijah got

03:24.739 --> 03:27.473
the covens to agree to ended at midnight.

03:27.503 --> 03:31.204
Every witch in the city is
gonna be gunning for her.

03:31.205 --> 03:32.499
Go to Elijah,

03:32.529 --> 03:33.998
get him to charm his elderly witch

03:34.028 --> 03:35.274
into calling off the hunt.

03:35.275 --> 03:36.683
And leave Hope?

03:36.713 --> 03:37.842
Don't you think I should stay here

03:37.843 --> 03:38.963
and protect our daughter?

03:38.993 --> 03:40.637
Jackson has been working night and day

03:40.667 --> 03:44.002
to secure this compound,
surrounding it with his werewolf army,

03:44.032 --> 03:46.623
not to mention the fact that I'm here,

03:46.653 --> 03:49.592
and I know the best
way to protect our child

03:49.622 --> 03:51.927
is to get Rebekah out of
that serial killer's body

03:51.957 --> 03:53.970
and back into the original model.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.421
Hmm. And what will you be doing

03:56.451 --> 03:58.955
while we're doing all the dirty work?

03:59.160 --> 04:03.442
Why, attending to the even dirtier work

04:04.285 --> 04:06.496
as usual.

04:12.535 --> 04:14.402
Ahem.

04:18.450 --> 04:21.100
I'm gonna go see if I can find Josephine.

04:25.451 --> 04:27.411
Ahem.

04:30.239 --> 04:34.626
Well, now I see why you
didn't answer my calls.

04:34.656 --> 04:37.250
Did she have to come with us?

04:37.676 --> 04:39.971
Josephine LaRue can be
rather recalcitrant.

04:40.001 --> 04:42.488
She is, however, enamored
with Gia's musical prowess

04:42.489 --> 04:43.797
and cavalier spirit.

04:43.827 --> 04:47.105
So the baby vamp is now
the witch whisperer.

04:47.276 --> 04:49.485
I'm just glad that you found someone

04:49.515 --> 04:52.923
so... multitalented to
spend your time with.

04:53.163 --> 04:57.001
What exactly do you want from me?

04:57.570 --> 04:59.634
(Footsteps)

04:59.664 --> 05:00.762
Madame LaRue.

05:00.792 --> 05:04.281
Mr. Mikaelson. Hmm.

05:05.094 --> 05:07.183
Have you come to impress me once more

05:07.213 --> 05:10.157
with young Gia's rare talents?

05:10.396 --> 05:13.439
Hayley: Ahem.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.211
What, pray tell, does this one do?

05:17.212 --> 05:21.212
This one is family, madame.

05:21.995 --> 05:24.951
We've come to ask a favor.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.290
Freya: Our sister was quite the beauty.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.665
You said that you could put Rebekah

05:35.695 --> 05:37.887
back in her original body.

05:38.075 --> 05:39.774
Do it.

05:39.804 --> 05:41.500
Heh. So you've come to your senses.

05:41.530 --> 05:43.497
My senses have not faltered.

05:43.498 --> 05:45.135
They still demand that
you are not to be trusted.

05:45.165 --> 05:49.167
However, circumstance dictates otherwise

05:49.168 --> 05:50.290
for now.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.726
What's changed?

05:51.756 --> 05:54.497
Eva Sinclair has resumed
control of her body,

05:54.527 --> 05:57.139
leaving Rebekah trapped and powerless,

05:57.140 --> 05:59.605
so make with your spells and enchantments

05:59.635 --> 06:01.943
and put my sister back in her true body.

06:01.973 --> 06:04.206
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

06:04.236 --> 06:07.113
More stalling. Very well.

06:07.114 --> 06:08.981
I know I can't kill you,

06:08.982 --> 06:11.576
but I shall have a fine time trying.

06:11.606 --> 06:14.424
Tell me, have you ever been skinned alive?

06:14.454 --> 06:17.770
The problem is Rebekah's
condition has worsened.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.628
When I offered to help, she
was in control of Eva's body.

06:21.658 --> 06:23.236
If she's lost inside Eva,

06:23.266 --> 06:26.280
I don't have a spell that can breach
Eva's mind and find her.

06:26.310 --> 06:30.823
Fortunately for you, I know someone
well versed in such spells.

06:36.101 --> 06:39.103
Let's go meet her, shall we?

06:40.963 --> 06:45.288
(Music playing)

07:00.532 --> 07:03.254
A little early, isn't it?

07:05.042 --> 07:07.221
You know why I'm
sitting here day drinking

07:07.222 --> 07:09.102
in the corner all by lonesome?

07:09.132 --> 07:11.758
No? Because I'm pretty much done

07:11.759 --> 07:13.460
and through with the
vamps, wolves, and witches

07:13.461 --> 07:15.952
of this town, and from some of the looks

07:15.982 --> 07:17.203
I've been getting, they're
through with me, too,

07:17.233 --> 07:20.587
so if I sit in here, they don't see me,

07:20.617 --> 07:23.544
and if I drink...

07:26.734 --> 07:30.073
After a while, I don't see them either.

07:31.438 --> 07:34.103
And how many is it gonna
take before she disappears?

07:34.133 --> 07:35.375
- Come on.
- Uh-uh.

07:35.376 --> 07:37.276
You need to know that she
is back and on the loose.

07:37.277 --> 07:39.555
Now I need to find her
before the witches do

07:39.585 --> 07:42.569
so I can save my friend who
is trapped inside of her,

07:42.599 --> 07:44.247
and I came to you because
you are the only person

07:44.248 --> 07:47.484
in this city who knows her inside out.

07:51.636 --> 07:55.721
Look, man. I'm sorry about your friend,

07:57.048 --> 07:59.639
but if Eva is back in
control of her body...

07:59.669 --> 08:01.637
Josephine: Then you
need to let the witches

08:01.667 --> 08:03.415
put that body down.

08:03.445 --> 08:06.668
Eva will use up your sister

08:06.698 --> 08:08.410
just like she did the others.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.538
The others?

08:09.568 --> 08:12.876
First of the kids went
missing two years ago.

08:13.729 --> 08:15.336
Feels like a lifetime.

08:15.337 --> 08:16.799
I was, uh, clocking in...

08:16.829 --> 08:19.206
college, work, coven.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.519
Felt like a normal life,

08:20.549 --> 08:23.342
but, um, had this woman.

08:23.343 --> 08:25.447
Met when we were 16 years old,

08:25.477 --> 08:27.400
did our first bit of magic together,

08:27.430 --> 08:29.158
and it was on.

08:29.188 --> 08:31.574
Insanely intense.

08:31.604 --> 08:35.650
Eva was a wild beauty
practicing a wild magic,

08:35.652 --> 08:38.240
but she and Vincent were so happy,

08:38.270 --> 08:40.339
we let them be.

08:40.369 --> 08:42.530
And then the children began to disappear.

08:42.561 --> 08:45.545
The first was a little
girl named Amelie Dupres

08:45.575 --> 08:48.159
from algiers.

08:48.189 --> 08:50.682
Then Luann Hughes from the ninth,

08:50.712 --> 08:53.425
Nicolas Asace from the Treme,

08:53.455 --> 08:55.882
all young kids, all witch prodigies.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.920
Sssewp! All vanished into thin air.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.151
So I put together a posse of guys

09:00.152 --> 09:01.218
from each of the covens,

09:01.219 --> 09:02.512
but the killer cloaked
the kids so quickly,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.552
our locator spells was useless.

09:04.582 --> 09:06.595
Josephine: But because
of Vincent's tenacity,

09:06.625 --> 09:08.177
she was caught.

09:08.207 --> 09:09.474
Vincent: It was a fluke.

09:09.504 --> 09:10.875
I was able to slap a locator spell

09:10.876 --> 09:12.610
on one of the kids right
after he got snatched,

09:12.611 --> 09:13.711
and I got nothing at first,

09:13.712 --> 09:16.534
and then a car and then a face,

09:16.564 --> 09:18.771
but that face...

09:19.032 --> 09:21.887
It was Eva, the love of my life.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.288
Heh.

09:24.023 --> 09:26.503
So I caught her, confronted her,

09:26.504 --> 09:28.169
and then I saw the truth.

09:28.199 --> 09:29.417
She kept pleading with me,

09:29.447 --> 09:33.164
"Vince, just 3 more little
girls, Vince, just 3."

09:33.194 --> 09:34.179
Why 3?

09:34.209 --> 09:36.977
To complete the rite of 9s.

09:36.978 --> 09:38.961
The rite of 9s?

09:38.991 --> 09:40.879
Eva thought that if she sacrificed

09:40.880 --> 09:42.797
a witch from each of the 9 covens,

09:42.827 --> 09:46.011
it would create a new
witch order in New Orleans.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.187
She would have been more
powerful than an elder,

09:48.217 --> 09:49.677
any Harvest girl.

09:49.707 --> 09:51.441
Wait, wait, wait.

09:51.471 --> 09:52.959
But why kids?

09:52.989 --> 09:55.223
Because their magic's untapped.

09:55.253 --> 09:56.868
It's pure,

09:56.898 --> 09:58.877
and they're a hell of
a lot easier to subdue.

09:58.907 --> 10:02.145
That's why she went after my baby.

10:03.068 --> 10:05.587
She would have killed your daughter,

10:05.617 --> 10:07.792
channeled her powers,

10:07.822 --> 10:11.781
as she did those other poor children.

10:12.755 --> 10:15.405
I never found those kids.

10:15.435 --> 10:17.524
They died unconsecrated,

10:17.554 --> 10:20.144
unable to be with our ancestors,

10:20.174 --> 10:22.983
used as a source for Eva's magic.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.932
So help me find her before she takes

10:24.962 --> 10:27.293
any more lives, including Rebekah's.

10:27.323 --> 10:29.105
Ohh.

10:29.686 --> 10:31.922
Help me stop her.

10:32.178 --> 10:34.186
Josephine: We agree she must be stopped.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.318
No more of our youth will die.

10:37.348 --> 10:39.888
That is why, Mr. Mikaelson,

10:39.889 --> 10:43.422
I will not extend your 24 hours.

10:43.883 --> 10:46.790
Eva Sinclair now has
a bounty on her head.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.277
You would condemn my sister to her death.

10:49.307 --> 10:52.074
I dislike the term collateral damage,

10:52.104 --> 10:53.732
but there it is.

10:53.762 --> 10:57.112
If one or two must fall in order to take

10:57.142 --> 10:59.790
Eva down for good,

10:59.820 --> 11:02.014
so be it.

11:10.593 --> 11:12.580
Freya: I fail to see the need for these.

11:12.610 --> 11:14.095
I'm not your enemy.

11:14.096 --> 11:15.942
Oh, they're not to protect me, luv.

11:15.972 --> 11:18.673
They're to protect her,
the one who knows more

11:18.703 --> 11:21.416
about mind invasion and body jumping

11:21.446 --> 11:23.638
than all of us put together.

11:38.075 --> 11:40.981
(Slurping)

11:45.311 --> 11:46.627
No, no!

11:46.657 --> 11:49.004
Mother...

11:49.260 --> 11:50.354
Freya.

11:50.384 --> 11:53.278
Freya, mother.

11:54.201 --> 11:55.573
It can't be.

11:55.603 --> 11:58.442
You won't trust me,
yet you would trust her?

11:58.443 --> 12:00.125
I trust my mother about as much

12:00.155 --> 12:02.266
as I would a stuck snake.

12:02.296 --> 12:05.147
Fortunately, she is now a vampire,

12:05.177 --> 12:09.518
and as such, vulnerable to my compulsion.

12:09.868 --> 12:12.959
You will answer me

12:12.989 --> 12:15.167
truthfully.

12:15.197 --> 12:17.146
(Groaning)

12:17.176 --> 12:19.524
There. Now at lest everything that comes

12:19.525 --> 12:22.343
out of her wretched mouth will be honest.

12:23.078 --> 12:26.627
Let's raid mommy dearest's
mind for spells, shall we?

12:32.656 --> 12:34.092
Oh, yes.

12:41.607 --> 12:43.441
Agh!

12:46.528 --> 12:48.278
Oh, ho ho ho!

12:48.279 --> 12:50.785
Not really keen on
another witch headache.

12:50.815 --> 12:52.033
Dark objects.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.947
How did a damn vamp find me?

12:53.977 --> 12:55.582
Had a little help, someone who knew

12:55.583 --> 12:59.270
where an injured witch on
the run might go to heal up.

13:02.735 --> 13:04.393
Vince.

13:04.701 --> 13:08.402
No time for catch-up.
Release Rebekah now!

13:08.432 --> 13:09.581
You best not damage the package,

13:09.611 --> 13:11.530
or you might never see her again

13:11.560 --> 13:13.257
or your other little adopted witch.

13:13.287 --> 13:15.244
Davina.

13:15.274 --> 13:17.039
What did you just say?

13:17.069 --> 13:18.321
Ha ha ha!

13:18.351 --> 13:20.591
Oh, some daddy figure you are.

13:20.621 --> 13:22.010
I've been feeding off her for days,

13:22.040 --> 13:24.027
and you didn't even know she was gone?

13:24.057 --> 13:25.019
Erggh!

13:25.049 --> 13:26.882
Where is she?

13:26.912 --> 13:28.397
Release me, and you can have what's left.

13:28.427 --> 13:29.525
No.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.041
Aah!

13:31.042 --> 13:31.966
I think I'll just torture you

13:31.996 --> 13:33.658
until you give me what I need!

13:33.688 --> 13:35.360
Torture ain't gonna do it, man.

13:35.390 --> 13:36.813
Half the witches in
this city went after her,

13:36.843 --> 13:39.120
she ain't say a thing.

13:40.915 --> 13:42.521
You got a better idea?

13:42.551 --> 13:44.350
Yeah.

13:46.295 --> 13:48.791
Let me talk to her.

13:51.432 --> 13:52.731
Elijah: Let me assure you, madam LaRue,

13:52.761 --> 13:55.363
we will defend your witches
with a fearsome vigilance.

13:55.393 --> 13:58.042
You have wonderful way with words really.

13:58.072 --> 14:00.528
Your cadence is pleasant.

14:00.529 --> 14:03.730
Normally, I could listen
to it all day long,

14:03.760 --> 14:07.302
but I grow tired of this.

14:07.332 --> 14:10.626
My mind remains unchanged.

14:10.656 --> 14:13.208
Are you serious?

14:13.238 --> 14:14.725
She puts on a talent show,

14:14.755 --> 14:16.939
he has every vampire in
the quarter kissing you ass,

14:16.940 --> 14:18.978
and your final answer is "screw you"?

14:19.008 --> 14:20.111
- Hayley.
- Back off.

14:20.141 --> 14:22.443
We came here to honor
the alliance between us.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.310
If this is something you wish to rescind,

14:24.340 --> 14:26.105
so be it.

14:28.262 --> 14:32.792
Don't you dare walk into my house

14:32.822 --> 14:35.070
and threaten me.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.326
I am not the one that
needs you, Elijah Mikaelson.

14:38.356 --> 14:41.197
It is you who needs us,

14:41.227 --> 14:45.693
or you will soon enough.

14:48.996 --> 14:52.996
There's a storm coming, cherie,

14:53.026 --> 14:56.627
and your darkest demons

14:56.657 --> 14:58.354
ride upon it.

14:58.384 --> 15:01.304
I do not know its name,

15:01.305 --> 15:05.774
but when I peer into your future,

15:05.804 --> 15:10.074
there is a blackness...

15:10.104 --> 15:14.014
That should terrify you.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.850
I heard they'd gotten you,

15:18.851 --> 15:20.755
that you'd been taken
over by the crazed brother

15:20.785 --> 15:22.817
of the one that's still inside me.

15:22.847 --> 15:24.424
Yep.

15:25.852 --> 15:27.630
But I'm back now.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.124
So you are,

15:30.125 --> 15:31.824
the man that sold out his own girl

15:31.854 --> 15:32.849
and gave up on their future.

15:32.879 --> 15:35.560
Eva, don't start with me.
Now Marcel said that...

15:35.590 --> 15:38.096
oh, Vincent, are you
kissing vampire ass now?

15:38.097 --> 15:39.463
- Hoo!
- This city could have been free

15:39.464 --> 15:41.754
of their kind if you hadn't been
such a weak, little coward!

15:41.784 --> 15:43.266
You left me with no choice.

15:43.267 --> 15:44.681
I couldn't let you go
on doing what you...

15:44.711 --> 15:46.391
oh, please. You saw how
beaten down we'd become...

15:46.421 --> 15:48.271
covens from every ward
fighting each other,

15:48.301 --> 15:49.784
half of them working with vampires.

15:49.814 --> 15:51.561
Now change was necessary.

15:51.591 --> 15:53.083
Unity was necessary.

15:53.113 --> 15:55.271
Killing kids was necessary?

15:55.301 --> 15:58.436
Vincent, I didn't kill any kids.

15:58.466 --> 16:00.504
They're still alive,

16:00.534 --> 16:02.726
just asleep,

16:02.756 --> 16:04.470
cloaked of course.

16:07.429 --> 16:08.951
All of them?

16:08.952 --> 16:10.181
Uh-huh.

16:10.211 --> 16:11.887
I just need their power.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.417
They don't need to die.

16:16.682 --> 16:19.006
Esther: My beautiful girl,

16:19.036 --> 16:20.049
my firstborn.

16:20.079 --> 16:21.776
Touch me, and I will use

16:21.806 --> 16:23.382
these chains to strangle you.

16:23.412 --> 16:25.686
Klaus: Yes. Well, now that
we have the pleasantries

16:25.716 --> 16:28.999
out of the way, let's begin, shall we?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.654
It appears your delightful
sister Dahlia is on her way

16:32.684 --> 16:35.695
to New Orleans and hell-bent
on stealing my child.

16:35.725 --> 16:38.105
I need Rebekah back in her original body

16:38.106 --> 16:39.845
so she can help me destroy her.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.541
Your... your child?

16:42.542 --> 16:44.936
Oh. Yes, I suppose it is difficult

16:44.966 --> 16:46.526
keeping up on current events

16:46.556 --> 16:49.579
whilst rotting inside a tomb.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.495
Very well. The short version.

16:52.525 --> 16:54.412
My child is alive,

16:54.442 --> 16:55.746
Dahlia is on her way,

16:55.776 --> 16:58.382
but now the previous tenant
of Rebekah's body has seized

16:58.412 --> 17:01.047
control and isn't keen on giving it up.

17:01.077 --> 17:02.619
Young Freya here, although powerful,

17:02.649 --> 17:05.523
lacks the spell to put
Rebekah back in her true body,

17:05.525 --> 17:08.326
and that's where you come in.

17:08.327 --> 17:12.128
I need you to be a dear and dig deep

17:12.130 --> 17:16.465
in that ex-witch mind of yours.

17:17.286 --> 17:22.038
Give me the spell that puts Rebekah back.

17:30.606 --> 17:34.982
You know, even when you
betrayed me, I didn't blame you.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.914
You just couldn't see the light,

17:39.915 --> 17:43.922
but you see it now, don't you,

17:43.952 --> 17:45.257
now that your body was stolen

17:45.287 --> 17:46.803
by the very same family of vampires

17:46.833 --> 17:49.783
that are trying to steal mine!

17:49.813 --> 17:52.408
You see what's got to be done.

17:56.378 --> 17:59.557
Now I just need one more witch,

17:59.985 --> 18:03.379
and then we can finish
the ritual together,

18:04.053 --> 18:05.417
take all the power we need,

18:05.418 --> 18:09.244
and then those kids can
go home to their mums.

18:10.030 --> 18:14.211
And we need never be under
their control ever again.

18:15.596 --> 18:19.801
I can hear her yapping, but
clearly she's not talking.

18:20.314 --> 18:22.991
I guess we're back to square one.

18:25.732 --> 18:28.499
Actually, she did talk,

18:28.500 --> 18:31.270
and I decided to listen.

18:32.589 --> 18:35.393
Aah!

18:56.820 --> 18:58.978
Great. So Eva is still in the wind,

18:59.008 --> 19:00.841
although now she has a sidekick.

19:00.871 --> 19:02.701
The charming Vincent Griffith.

19:02.731 --> 19:03.799
It gets worse.

19:03.829 --> 19:05.673
If Eva has Davina, then she has 8

19:05.703 --> 19:08.374
of the witches she needs
to finish the ritual.

19:08.404 --> 19:11.259
She just needs one more.

19:11.289 --> 19:13.364
If she comes after Hope,

19:13.365 --> 19:14.331
Rebekah or no Rebekah,

19:14.332 --> 19:16.040
I will put her down for good.

19:16.070 --> 19:19.035
Fortify this house. When
they do come, kill him,

19:19.065 --> 19:20.350
- capture her.
- Capture?

19:20.380 --> 19:23.472
I will not abandon my sister.

19:24.607 --> 19:26.218
Now gather what wolves you have.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.974
With Vincent by her side, she will strike

19:27.975 --> 19:29.935
with considerable force.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.043
(Music playing)

19:40.884 --> 19:42.818
(Scratch)

19:44.456 --> 19:47.688
The revered Josephine Larue.

19:47.689 --> 19:51.320
How are you on this very fine day, dear?

19:51.350 --> 19:54.292
Oh. You look nervous.

19:54.322 --> 19:57.473
Are you nervous, Josie?

19:57.503 --> 19:59.016
You should be.

19:59.046 --> 20:02.706
You see, I just need
one more special witch

20:02.736 --> 20:04.738
to complete my circle.

20:04.768 --> 20:08.487
Now the hybrid child was
a target of opportunity.

20:08.517 --> 20:10.390
You...

20:12.292 --> 20:15.173
You're a target of choice.

20:15.203 --> 20:20.195
Vincent, you're not listening to her.

20:20.515 --> 20:22.112
You haven't been yourself lately.

20:22.142 --> 20:25.888
You're right. I haven't been,

20:25.918 --> 20:27.505
but now that I'm back,

20:27.535 --> 20:29.946
I realize something.

20:29.976 --> 20:33.083
The only time I've ever been myself...

20:35.403 --> 20:36.665
is when I'm with her.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.088
Oh.

20:38.319 --> 20:40.058
No!

20:44.862 --> 20:46.451
What is taking so long?

20:46.481 --> 20:49.632
You didn't tarry when you
attempted to kill my child.

20:49.633 --> 20:52.122
I took no joy in that.

20:52.152 --> 20:53.962
I knew if your daughter lived

20:53.992 --> 20:56.069
Dahlia would come not only for her

20:56.070 --> 20:57.384
but for all of you,

20:57.414 --> 20:59.269
and however you may despise me,

20:59.299 --> 21:01.379
I would not wish that upon you.

21:01.409 --> 21:03.014
How touching.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.331
Isn't it?

21:04.361 --> 21:07.473
I always wondered what maternal
compassion sounded like.

21:07.503 --> 21:09.942
Of course, I wouldn't know
since you sold me into slavery

21:09.972 --> 21:12.360
at the age of 5.

21:12.390 --> 21:14.635
When I made that bargain with my sister,

21:14.665 --> 21:18.538
I had no idea what it
meant to be a mother.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.052
I thought if I had a dozen children

21:20.053 --> 21:23.187
I... I would not miss the one,

21:23.502 --> 21:25.790
and then you were born.

21:25.791 --> 21:28.324
You were beautiful.

21:28.993 --> 21:31.494
You had a light about you.

21:31.495 --> 21:35.524
It put a smile on the face
of the hardest man I had ever known,

21:35.554 --> 21:38.123
and when Dahlia took you,

21:38.153 --> 21:42.234
I believed that same light
might warm her embittered heart,

21:42.264 --> 21:45.516
that you would lead a good life.

21:45.546 --> 21:47.872
A good life?

21:47.873 --> 21:50.241
You were my mother!

21:51.341 --> 21:53.590
You should have come for me.

21:53.772 --> 21:57.745
Yes, I should have,

21:58.167 --> 22:00.518
but it would have been a mistake,

22:00.827 --> 22:04.971
the same mistake you'll be making
if you let this girl help you.

22:05.001 --> 22:08.707
For God's sake, speak plainly.

22:08.737 --> 22:11.255
The light I saw in Freya as a child,

22:11.256 --> 22:12.612
it's gone.

22:12.642 --> 22:14.599
While she was mine for 5 years,

22:14.629 --> 22:17.409
Dahlia was her mentor for a thousand,

22:17.439 --> 22:19.960
and like her mentor, she will offer

22:19.961 --> 22:23.763
to solve your problem but for a price.

22:23.764 --> 22:25.719
There is no price. I loathe Dahlia!

22:25.749 --> 22:29.704
No violence until she's finished
writing the spell, please.

22:29.734 --> 22:32.883
Honestly, it's all temper
and no timing with this one.

22:32.913 --> 22:35.672
Heh. I for one am glad you gave her away

22:35.702 --> 22:37.894
so that I could be born.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.810
You should think of me as an upgrade.

22:44.973 --> 22:47.114
There.

22:49.089 --> 22:51.617
Where are the others?

23:00.355 --> 23:02.489
That's the Harvest girl.

23:02.519 --> 23:03.546
Davina Claire.

23:03.576 --> 23:06.794
Now once I link Josephine, we can begin.

23:08.930 --> 23:11.037
Though I should admit

23:11.067 --> 23:13.698
I told a little lie earlier.

23:13.938 --> 23:15.623
In order to save the many,

23:15.653 --> 23:18.203
we've got to sacrifice a few.

23:20.329 --> 23:22.369
You understand, Vince?

23:22.399 --> 23:24.040
Yeah.

23:34.114 --> 23:36.615
Unh!

23:36.871 --> 23:40.084
Yeah. I figured as much.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.815
Hayley: Still no sign of her.
What the hell is Eva waiting for.

23:43.845 --> 23:45.148
Marcel: She didn't wait.

23:45.178 --> 23:47.404
She took Josephine LaRue
not half an hour a go.

23:47.434 --> 23:49.862
If Eva doesn't need Hope,
then where would she go?

23:49.892 --> 23:51.499
Same place she kept
all the other captives,

23:51.529 --> 23:52.856
where she took Davina.

23:52.886 --> 23:54.193
A place no one has been able to find

23:54.194 --> 23:55.828
for two years.

23:55.829 --> 23:57.627
(Cell phone ringing)

24:02.507 --> 24:04.130
When I find you, I am going to rip

24:04.160 --> 24:05.588
your head from your neck.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.707
You might want to hold
off on that decapitation.

24:08.737 --> 24:10.627
I found them all.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.144
Davina's alive.

24:12.174 --> 24:14.141
Sorry. I had to make it look convincing.

24:14.171 --> 24:15.982
If you were in on the plan,

24:16.012 --> 24:17.676
Eva would have known.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.243
Yeah. Blasting me through a
couple glass doors really sold it.

24:20.273 --> 24:23.915
All right. Round of applause. Now what?

24:28.652 --> 24:30.589
Now we got a problem.

24:30.619 --> 24:34.022
These kids, they're all linked to her.

24:35.669 --> 24:38.459
If she dies, they all die.

24:39.331 --> 24:42.891
So we'll find a witch to unlink them.

24:43.140 --> 24:47.479
We're gonna need somebody
with some serious power.

24:55.137 --> 24:56.452
I can't do this.

24:56.482 --> 24:58.807
This spell requires an
enormous amount of power.

24:58.837 --> 24:59.963
Which you have.

24:59.993 --> 25:02.253
And that power needs to be anchored,

25:02.283 --> 25:04.895
or I'll be lost inside Eva's
mind along with Rebekah.

25:04.925 --> 25:08.284
Unlike your magic, mine isn't
anchored to any one place.

25:08.314 --> 25:10.498
Because of you, I have no home.

25:10.528 --> 25:11.837
Perhaps,

25:11.867 --> 25:14.232
but there is no other spell.

25:15.761 --> 25:17.832
Oh. You.

25:20.357 --> 25:22.456
I can use you as my anchor.

25:22.486 --> 25:25.658
I'll channel your power
while I breach Eva's mind.

25:25.659 --> 25:28.880
And there it is. The price.

25:28.910 --> 25:32.087
If she channels you, she
will have access to your mind

25:32.117 --> 25:33.793
past and present.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.733
She will know everything about you.

25:40.702 --> 25:43.872
All of my strategies

25:43.902 --> 25:47.672
and all of my secrets laid bare

25:47.870 --> 25:50.443
to give to Dahlia.

25:53.288 --> 25:56.329
You must think I'm a fool.

25:56.359 --> 25:59.075
Elijah: Unless it's not a trick.

25:59.749 --> 26:01.015
I'll be the anchor.

26:01.016 --> 26:03.653
Brother, I think not.

26:03.683 --> 26:06.818
Brother, whatever this is,

26:06.848 --> 26:08.988
nothing must prevent us
from saving our sister.

26:08.989 --> 26:11.489
I will not lose Rebekah.

26:11.519 --> 26:14.276
Oh, yes, by all means,
let's give Dahlia's whelp

26:14.306 --> 26:17.299
access to all the information
she needs to destroy us.

26:17.329 --> 26:19.795
And since do we heed
the word of this serpent?

26:19.825 --> 26:22.065
Enough!

26:23.946 --> 26:26.000
(Neck snaps)

26:26.471 --> 26:29.941
For an upgraded model,
you're not very sharp.

26:29.971 --> 26:32.111
Let's go.

26:39.142 --> 26:42.409
Gia: Oh. This place smells like werewolf.

26:42.439 --> 26:46.644
Well, that's because Jackson has
a whole platoon of them out there.

26:46.674 --> 26:49.950
You know, you can go.
You don't have to stay.

26:49.980 --> 26:54.118
Elijah says you and your kid
have more than one enemy.

26:56.544 --> 27:00.296
If someone manages to make it through
the dog show outside,

27:00.326 --> 27:02.318
you and the baby run,

27:02.348 --> 27:04.060
I stay and stall them.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.095
You don't know me.

27:06.345 --> 27:09.753
Why would you put yourself
in harm's way for us?

27:09.783 --> 27:12.936
I don't have to know you.

27:12.966 --> 27:15.210
I know Elijah,

27:15.793 --> 27:19.824
and I know what you mean to him...

27:21.726 --> 27:24.401
What this baby means to him.

27:24.431 --> 27:27.384
He talks about me with you.

27:29.730 --> 27:32.073
No, but I'm not blind.

27:32.103 --> 27:36.278
It's pretty obvious you have the guy
all bent out of shape.

27:36.308 --> 27:38.224
Look. After you got married,

27:38.254 --> 27:39.860
we started hanging out.

27:39.890 --> 27:44.264
He was just so wound up.

27:44.294 --> 27:45.889
I guess it must be tough to spend

27:45.890 --> 27:47.982
a thousand years being the shoulder

27:48.012 --> 27:51.046
everyone else leans on.

27:52.646 --> 27:55.529
Maybe he just needs

27:55.530 --> 27:59.470
to live his life for himself for once.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.554
Freya: Lay her inside the salt
and lie on either side of her.

28:05.584 --> 28:07.305
Each of you take her hand.

28:07.306 --> 28:10.166
I will act as a bridge into her mind,

28:10.196 --> 28:11.943
but I'm trusting you
to anchor me, brother.

28:11.973 --> 28:13.987
Do what you need to do.

28:14.017 --> 28:15.510
Rebekah's buried deep.

28:15.511 --> 28:18.107
Eva will not give her up without a fight.

28:18.137 --> 28:19.580
Then she gets a fight.

28:19.581 --> 28:22.055
Be careful. You're entering Eva's mind.

28:22.085 --> 28:25.617
If she kills you in
there, you will be lost,

28:25.867 --> 28:27.512
and if you kill her
before you free Rebekah,

28:27.542 --> 28:30.036
then Rebekah will be gone forever.

28:30.066 --> 28:31.321
Once you have Rebekah,

28:31.322 --> 28:34.565
then and only then can Eva be dealt with.

28:34.595 --> 28:36.569
We got it.

28:36.599 --> 28:38.827
You need a weapon.

28:41.496 --> 28:44.915
How am I supposed to take that with me?

28:44.945 --> 28:46.337
Lamina ferri in mentem.

28:46.367 --> 28:48.283
Lamina ferri in mentem.

28:48.284 --> 28:51.085
Lamina ferri in mentem.

28:51.086 --> 28:53.285
This is going to hurt.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.116
Aah!

29:05.792 --> 29:07.320
Ok.

29:08.707 --> 29:10.799
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.034
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

29:13.035 --> 29:15.035
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

29:15.036 --> 29:17.104
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

29:17.105 --> 29:19.505
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

29:19.506 --> 29:21.606
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

29:21.607 --> 29:24.675
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

29:24.676 --> 29:26.510
Aah!

29:26.511 --> 29:27.710
(Gasping)

29:27.711 --> 29:29.579
(Young Rebekah screams)

29:29.580 --> 29:31.280
Rebekah!

29:31.281 --> 29:32.749
Gah!

29:34.538 --> 29:36.652
Marcel!

29:42.139 --> 29:44.290
(Gasps)

29:48.875 --> 29:51.494
You recover fast, but they're gone.

29:51.495 --> 29:53.016
I compelled you to tell the truth,

29:53.046 --> 29:55.679
not state the bloody obvious.

29:55.709 --> 29:57.581
She will poison them against you.

29:57.611 --> 29:59.350
You know that.

29:59.616 --> 30:02.644
And you suddenly care, do you?

30:02.674 --> 30:07.849
Klaus, lying here,
starving in the darkness,

30:07.879 --> 30:11.694
I have thought of nothing
except what could have been

30:11.724 --> 30:16.366
if I had left you to
live a single mortal life.

30:16.396 --> 30:20.265
We would have burnt bright for a while

30:20.266 --> 30:22.998
and then burnt out.

30:23.194 --> 30:26.464
You see, you think of turning
us as your greatest sin,

30:26.494 --> 30:29.838
but the truth is it's the
only one of your many faults

30:29.839 --> 30:32.796
I've come to forgive.

30:32.826 --> 30:35.831
I prefer us as we are.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.244
No, my son.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.280
We are a macabre echo of a family,

30:42.489 --> 30:45.048
and I take all the blame for that.

30:45.294 --> 30:48.417
I only wanted to undo my evil

30:48.774 --> 30:52.698
that you might love me again.

30:58.094 --> 31:00.916
My mother...

31:00.946 --> 31:03.565
The comedian.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.097
Enjoy the darkness.

31:08.098 --> 31:09.533
(Sobs)

31:15.949 --> 31:18.527
(Young Rebekah crying)

31:22.142 --> 31:24.311
Rebekah?

31:26.658 --> 31:29.551
Rebekah, it's ok. It's safe.

31:30.151 --> 31:32.938
Eva: You people just
don't give up, do you?

31:32.968 --> 31:35.017
Run.

31:38.742 --> 31:40.658
You think you're a vampire in here,

31:40.688 --> 31:42.637
in my world?

31:42.667 --> 31:44.801
I'm the one who makes the rules in here.

31:44.831 --> 31:48.359
I'm the one who says how you die.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.062
Aah!

31:56.266 --> 31:59.001
(Chanting)

32:04.956 --> 32:09.689
The great Marcel, one-time vampire king.

32:10.626 --> 32:12.386
Vincent: Eva!

32:12.760 --> 32:14.378
That's enough.

32:14.379 --> 32:15.883
It's over.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.448
(Thunder)

32:19.382 --> 32:21.349
Not a bad bit of acting,

32:21.379 --> 32:24.085
fooling me back there.

32:24.086 --> 32:28.086
Pretty slick and cold.

32:28.916 --> 32:32.423
Colder than I remembered you.

32:32.424 --> 32:34.192
(Sighs)

32:34.193 --> 32:35.993
It's your eyes,

32:35.994 --> 32:38.365
those damn sexy eyes,

32:38.730 --> 32:40.940
making me think you love me

32:40.970 --> 32:44.543
right before you bury a knife in my back.

32:46.868 --> 32:49.802
You break my heart, Vince.

32:50.018 --> 32:54.306
Fool me once, shame on you.

32:54.307 --> 32:56.307
Fool me twice...

32:56.308 --> 32:59.276
(Grunting)

32:59.277 --> 33:01.111
(Freya chanting)

33:01.112 --> 33:02.278
Aah!

33:02.279 --> 33:03.979
(Chanting)

33:03.980 --> 33:06.063
(Gasping)

33:07.483 --> 33:09.483
(Chanting)

33:09.484 --> 33:11.611
I'm losing them.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.082
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

33:14.112 --> 33:17.490
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

33:19.561 --> 33:21.358
We're not finished, you and I,

33:21.359 --> 33:23.393
but for right now,

33:23.394 --> 33:26.161
save my sister.

33:26.610 --> 33:29.193
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

33:29.223 --> 33:31.898
Pontem praesidio. Anchora immortalibus.

33:31.899 --> 33:34.334
- Agh!
- Aah!

33:34.335 --> 33:35.467
Aah!

33:35.468 --> 33:38.203
(Gasping)

33:39.091 --> 33:43.273
Is that what you think
heartache feel like, Eva?

33:43.274 --> 33:45.174
Oh, you got no idea.

33:45.585 --> 33:47.197
I wanted to rip my own heart out

33:47.227 --> 33:51.576
every time I woke so I couldn't
feel what you did to me,

33:51.606 --> 33:57.262
that bone-deep hurt knowing that I
could not save them kids from you,

33:57.292 --> 33:59.351
the woman I loved more than my own life.

33:59.352 --> 34:01.486
Aah!

34:01.487 --> 34:04.422
We could have had everything.

34:04.423 --> 34:07.324
You chose this.

34:07.325 --> 34:09.848
It's on you.

34:11.176 --> 34:12.219
Eva.

34:12.248 --> 34:15.763
Good-bye, Vince.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.001
Aah! Aah!

34:23.335 --> 34:26.402
(Groaning)

34:26.404 --> 34:29.106
(Thunder)

34:44.451 --> 34:46.150
Did it work?

34:48.525 --> 34:51.210
Davina: Somebody? Where am I?

34:56.185 --> 34:57.767
They're ok!

34:57.797 --> 34:59.332
Marcel!

35:08.825 --> 35:11.203
Why isn't she waking?

35:13.437 --> 35:15.138
(Gasps)

35:20.643 --> 35:22.744
Bloody hell.

35:45.687 --> 35:47.524
What?

35:47.554 --> 35:50.167
You're not fishing for
a thank you, I hope.

35:50.197 --> 35:51.849
I'd find myself freezing in hell

35:51.879 --> 35:54.338
before I got one from you.

35:54.368 --> 35:56.696
Well, come on then. Let's get
you back in your proper body,

35:56.726 --> 35:59.044
though I'll likely have
to torture Freya and Esther

35:59.074 --> 36:02.170
to do so, which actually
might be quite fun.

36:02.515 --> 36:05.472
No, Nik. I'm staying put.

36:06.222 --> 36:08.281
Eva's gone for good, but her body,

36:08.311 --> 36:12.144
this body is still linked
to Davina and those children.

36:12.145 --> 36:13.824
I can feel it,

36:13.854 --> 36:15.270
and if I leave it, then it dies,

36:15.300 --> 36:18.048
and Davina and the others die with it.

36:18.049 --> 36:19.716
So bloody what?

36:19.717 --> 36:21.870
I happen to like Davina.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.286
I'm not about to let her die.

36:24.936 --> 36:26.310
Besides, do you really want the wrath

36:26.340 --> 36:30.863
of every New Orleans witch
upon us just as Dahlia arrives?

36:30.893 --> 36:32.659
We need them on our side

36:32.689 --> 36:37.222
or at the very least
not siding against us,

36:37.596 --> 36:40.264
and there's also the matter of Kol.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.282
I vowed I'd bring him back.

36:42.312 --> 36:43.766
I can't even attempt to do that

36:43.767 --> 36:45.968
if I'm not a witch.

36:48.821 --> 36:51.772
Freya's been inside my head.

36:52.017 --> 36:55.083
She knows my secrets.

36:55.439 --> 36:58.840
So she knows you go
very far for very few?

36:58.870 --> 37:01.180
So bloody what?

37:03.537 --> 37:07.484
Niklaus, just for one second,

37:07.514 --> 37:09.870
can we just be what we need to be,

37:09.900 --> 37:12.854
a family united?

37:19.088 --> 37:20.759
For now,

37:20.760 --> 37:22.794
for you.

37:32.261 --> 37:34.269
Nik.

37:35.617 --> 37:37.772
Thank you.

37:40.652 --> 37:43.443
(Music playing)

37:46.870 --> 37:49.212
Rebekah, voice-over: There's
a saying in my family...

37:49.213 --> 37:52.085
"kill a demon today,

37:52.115 --> 37:54.769
face the devil tomorrow,"

37:54.799 --> 37:59.021
yet even as you dance
on that demon's grave,

37:59.341 --> 38:01.115
you can't help but wonder

38:01.145 --> 38:03.781
was that demon alone...

38:04.986 --> 38:09.088
Or do you have other,
deadlier ones to fight?

38:10.790 --> 38:14.448
And though you celebrate
having won the battle...

38:17.301 --> 38:19.085
You are one of us now.

38:19.115 --> 38:22.169
New Orleans is your home.

38:22.199 --> 38:24.670
Your friends are our friends,

38:24.671 --> 38:28.140
your enemies ours.

38:30.136 --> 38:32.775
Rebekah, voice-over: Have you
really prepared for the war?

38:32.776 --> 38:34.523
(Humming)

38:38.194 --> 38:41.083
Come to check on me again, brother?

38:46.483 --> 38:48.071
Maybe you've wormed your way

38:48.101 --> 38:50.977
into the witches' good graces

38:51.007 --> 38:54.124
and my siblings', too,

38:54.125 --> 38:56.004
but I see you

38:56.034 --> 38:58.694
for what you really are,

38:58.695 --> 39:02.065
even if they cannot.

39:02.314 --> 39:05.604
They are not burdened
by crippling paranoia,

39:05.634 --> 39:08.017
the kind that leaves
you muttering to yourself

39:08.047 --> 39:09.701
alone in the dark,

39:09.702 --> 39:13.738
"where has everyone gone?"

39:13.739 --> 39:15.368
Mean of me, yes.

39:15.398 --> 39:18.617
Shouldn't bring up
your childhood secrets,

39:18.647 --> 39:19.712
but don't worry.

39:19.742 --> 39:21.272
All I saw when I channeled you

39:21.302 --> 39:25.458
were anger issues and a
questionable taste in women.

39:26.324 --> 39:30.733
I was once alone, brother.

39:31.213 --> 39:34.005
It would be a shame if you were the one

39:34.035 --> 39:37.155
who now found himself so.

39:38.453 --> 39:41.494
It doesn't have to be
like this of course,

39:41.524 --> 39:43.108
but be careful.

39:43.138 --> 39:46.462
I have only so much patience.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.054
Rebekah, voice-over:
So as we dress ourselves

39:49.084 --> 39:52.671
in the armor needed for this new fight...

39:53.844 --> 39:56.934
We must first tend to our wounds,

39:56.935 --> 39:59.871
starting with the deepest.

40:02.649 --> 40:04.106
Freya.

40:04.107 --> 40:07.041
You were wrong about me.

40:07.280 --> 40:11.445
I loathe Dahlia more
than you could ever know.

40:11.951 --> 40:15.014
You don't see that light in me?

40:15.324 --> 40:18.622
That's because she snuffed it out.

40:18.652 --> 40:20.889
I was 5,

40:21.146 --> 40:24.458
and she was the devil.

40:24.680 --> 40:31.040
She took my light, my love,

40:31.635 --> 40:34.689
my will to live,

40:34.719 --> 40:38.998
my ability to die.

40:39.231 --> 40:42.267
You are no longer my mother,

40:42.268 --> 40:45.470
but I am not her child.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.604
I am so sorry.

40:48.605 --> 40:53.454
Ahh. It's a little late for that,

40:53.484 --> 40:57.010
but it turns out you were
right about one thing.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.845
Maybe Klaus shouldn't have let me glimpse

40:59.846 --> 41:01.605
inside his mind.

41:01.635 --> 41:04.192
I warned him to be wary of you,

41:04.222 --> 41:06.023
of what you might see.

41:06.053 --> 41:08.970
Oh, I saw quite a bit,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.636
but I only learned one thing.

41:10.666 --> 41:14.561
Klaus and I can never be allies.

41:14.591 --> 41:17.881
I now see that he will never trust me,

41:17.911 --> 41:20.863
so he leaves me no choice.

41:20.893 --> 41:24.112
I will have to turn
the family against him

41:24.142 --> 41:27.912
one by one, and now I know how to do it.

41:27.942 --> 41:30.644
Why are you telling me this?

41:34.635 --> 41:38.114
Because you won't be around to see it.

41:38.115 --> 41:40.885
