WEBVTT

00:04.482 --> 00:06.789
Hey, babe, babe, babe,
check it out.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.182
The biggest one they had.

00:08.225 --> 00:12.403
Boom! 23 pounds.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.188
There'’s gonna be so much
leftover turkey,

00:14.231 --> 00:16.364
I'’m gonna be sleepy
for weeks.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.105
Well, put it back.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.628
There'’s only four of us,

00:19.671 --> 00:21.456
and I'’m not cooking
that big-ass turkey.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.110
Where'’s your Thanksgiving
spirit, babe?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.720
I'’ll tell you where.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.156
Out on your brother'’s boat,

00:26.200 --> 00:27.723
with the rest of your family.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.942
You know what,
I don'’t care if he invited us.

00:29.986 --> 00:33.424
I'’m done letting Curtis throw
his lotto money in my face.

00:33.468 --> 00:34.947
He wouldn'’t even never won

00:34.991 --> 00:36.601
if I wouldn'’t have stopped
at that gas station

00:36.645 --> 00:38.038
to get Mama a Pepsi.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.997
Look, I thought I was
gonna have the day off.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.781
Just get a smaller one,

00:42.825 --> 00:44.609
and stop trying to make me
cook a pterodactyl.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.221
Fine. How big?

00:47.264 --> 00:49.223
Let'’s go with 12 pounds.

00:49.266 --> 00:52.791
12 pounds? What the rest
of y'’all gonna eat?

00:52.835 --> 00:54.184
Fine.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.188
Hi, Tina.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.885
Oh, hey, guys.
What'’s up?

00:59.929 --> 01:02.410
Ooh, looks like you'’re stocking
up for the big day, huh?

01:02.453 --> 01:04.368
So, you have a bunch
of family coming over?

01:04.412 --> 01:07.067
No, just Calvin and the boys
sitting on the couch

01:07.110 --> 01:09.504
while I cook my butt off
in the kitchen,

01:09.547 --> 01:11.506
sweating over a stove,
you know, alone.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.725
A holiday.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.162
Well, if that'’s the case,

01:15.205 --> 01:16.380
you should just come
to our house.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.729
Right, Gemma?I'’d love that.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.775
Well, are you sure?
I don'’t want to impose.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.125
Come on, it'’ll be fun.
The men can watch football,

01:22.169 --> 01:24.127
and you can keep me company
while I do all the cooking.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.260
Okay, great, we'’re coming.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.305
Awesome. We'’ll see you
Thursday around noon?

01:28.349 --> 01:30.612
Are you sure I can'’t
bring anything?
We'’re sure.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.354
Good. That'’s the answer
I was looking for.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.877
All right.Hey, babe.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.009
Yeah?
Sorry.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.750
They didn'’t have
any 12-pounders,

01:38.794 --> 01:41.144
so I just rounded up
to a 20.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.365
Well, put it back, '’cause
we'’re going to the Johnsons'.

01:44.408 --> 01:45.540
The Johnsons'’?Uh-huh.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.194
You joking, right, Tina?Nope.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.934
I had to fight two people
to get this turkey.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.458
One lady threw
her dentures at me.

01:50.501 --> 01:53.852
Ooh, there she is right there.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.767
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:55.811 --> 01:56.507
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.168
Gemma, I have terrible news.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.691
I just got off the phone
with my mother.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.519
Oh, no, did something
happen to her?

02:08.563 --> 02:10.782
Worse. She'’s coming
for Thanksgiving.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.262
What?

02:12.306 --> 02:13.829
I thought she was going
to your Aunt Gail'’s.

02:13.872 --> 02:16.136
Well, yeah, apparently
they got into a fight

02:16.179 --> 02:19.182
over which is better,
NCISor NCIS: Los Angeles.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.447
And now she'’s coming
here instead.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.971
But why is it bad
that Grammy'’s coming?

02:26.015 --> 02:27.843
Oh, it'’s not bad, Grover.
It'’s terrible.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.018
Dave!

02:29.061 --> 02:31.281
I... Okay.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.805
Look, you know that nobody loves
Grammy more than I do,

02:33.849 --> 02:35.677
but... she'’s getting
a little bit older

02:35.720 --> 02:38.245
and she comes from
a small town and, well,

02:38.288 --> 02:40.943
you know how we tell you
that there are things

02:40.986 --> 02:42.684
that people might think

02:42.727 --> 02:45.687
but should never, ever say?Yeah.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.645
Grammy doesn'’t believe
that'’s true.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.213
Yeah. Hey, buddy.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.910
Can I talk to Mommy alone
for a minute?

02:51.954 --> 02:53.825
Are you gonna tell her
something about Grammy

02:53.869 --> 02:54.913
that you think
but shouldn'’t say?

02:54.957 --> 02:56.480
Yes.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.659
Gemma, what are we gonna do?

03:01.703 --> 03:04.053
We have to uninvite the Butlers.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.751
Sweetie, it'’s the day before
Thanksgiving; that'’d be rude.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.362
Ruder than my mom?

03:08.405 --> 03:09.972
Remember when she went off
on that lady

03:10.015 --> 03:12.583
about how we need
to "build the wall"?

03:12.627 --> 03:15.630
Yes, I do.

03:15.673 --> 03:19.634
We had to start going
to a different Taco Bell.

03:19.677 --> 03:22.593
Gemma, she is going to ruin
Thanksgiving, I know it.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.421
Sweetie, I know you get
embarrassed by your mom,

03:24.465 --> 03:25.857
but she'’s an adult.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.294
You'’re not in charge
of her behavior.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.774
And what if she says something
offensive to the Butlers?

03:29.818 --> 03:31.298
You know, Calvin and I
are starting

03:31.341 --> 03:32.603
to become such good friends.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.041
I know. But
you know what?

03:36.085 --> 03:38.087
Maybe it'’s a good
thing she'’s coming.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.915
You always say the reason
she'’s the way she is

03:39.958 --> 03:42.047
is because she only knows
people just like her.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.006
We can help change that.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.008
Okay, you know,
m-maybe you'’re right.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.531
You know, maybe
this is a chance

03:47.575 --> 03:49.272
for us to broaden
her horizons.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.621
To introduce her to

03:50.665 --> 03:53.102
a new spectrum
of people.
Exactly.

03:53.145 --> 03:56.018
Grammy wants to know how often
there are riots around here.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.541
Oh, no...

03:59.413 --> 04:01.502
Can I uninvite them now?

04:01.545 --> 04:02.459
Why are you still standing here?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.115
I cannot believe
that we'’re going

04:06.158 --> 04:08.248
to the Johnsons'’
for Thanksgiving.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.293
I mean, since we
weren'’t going to

04:10.337 --> 04:12.600
my brother Curtis'’s,
I thought I could finally

04:12.643 --> 04:14.384
start my own
Thanksgiving traditions.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.820
Like what?

04:15.864 --> 04:17.909
Like not going
to the Johnsons'’.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.130
[doorbell rings]

04:21.173 --> 04:23.132
Well, I plan on
laying around

04:23.175 --> 04:25.352
while somebody else
worries about the cooking.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.614
Feels good to be a man.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.228
Hey, Calvin.Come on in, man.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.012
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you guys about tomorrow.

04:34.056 --> 04:36.450
I'’m not wearing a
pilgrim'’s hat, Dave.

04:36.493 --> 04:39.409
Well, good news:
you won'’t have to

04:39.453 --> 04:41.585
because I'’m here to,
um, uninvite you.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.239
What?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.762
My man, Dave!

04:44.806 --> 04:46.286
Wait a minute.
[laughing]

04:46.329 --> 04:47.504
Wait a minute.Oh, yeah.

04:47.548 --> 04:48.984
Hold up.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.464
What do you mean,
you'’re uninviting us?

04:50.507 --> 04:52.379
Come on, it doesn'’t
matter, Tina. You know?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.337
We already hugged it out
and everything; a deal'’s a deal.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.730
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.166
Wait, where you going?
No, no.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.255
I want to know what happened.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.431
Well, as it turns out,
my mom is surprising us

05:01.475 --> 05:03.346
and flying in from
Michigan and, uh...

05:03.390 --> 05:05.740
[chuckles] ...she can
be kind of a handful.

05:05.783 --> 05:08.264
What do you mean,
she'’s a handful?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.919
Now, Tina, Tina.
The lady'’s a handful.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.268
What else do you need
to know? Come on.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.705
Well, look,
it just, it'’s...

05:14.749 --> 05:15.924
You know, she'’s
from a small town,

05:15.967 --> 05:17.273
she'’s kind of
old-school,

05:17.317 --> 05:18.361
she can be pretty
conservative.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.189
Oh, she'’s racist.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.845
No, she-she'’s not racist,

05:23.888 --> 05:25.716
she just says things
most people know not to

05:25.760 --> 05:27.718
because they'’re
horribly offensive.

05:27.762 --> 05:28.980
So she'’s like Calvin.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.419
How am I offensive?

05:32.462 --> 05:34.638
I mean, you'’re not
offensive as a person,

05:34.682 --> 05:36.945
but you know, it'’s,
it'’s just your words

05:36.988 --> 05:38.773
and your tone

05:38.816 --> 05:39.991
and your opinions.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.299
I just tell
the truth, Tina.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.866
Hmm.
It'’s not my fault

05:44.909 --> 05:47.347
that a bunch of little
crybabies can'’t handle it.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.000
That'’s actually
how my mom started

05:49.044 --> 05:50.393
her Christmas
letter last year.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.614
Listen, baby, I'’m
not trying to make

05:53.657 --> 05:55.485
you feel bad, but you know
you are not gonna

05:55.529 --> 05:57.531
be able to be around
somebody like Dave'’s mom.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.359
So, I guess
I'’ll be doing

05:59.402 --> 06:02.100
the cooking this year
after all.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.407
T-Tina, no.
You know what?

06:04.451 --> 06:06.670
No, you sit
back and relax.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.324
You'’re gonna get that
day off that you deserve.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.284
No. No, no, no.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.677
We agreed; we hugged
and everything.

06:15.897 --> 06:18.029
Sorry, Dave.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.379
I reject your uninvite.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.557
We'’re coming to your house
for Thanksgiving.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.776
Calvin, what
about my mom?

06:25.820 --> 06:27.256
Doesn'’t matter.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.779
You know, like I always say,

06:28.823 --> 06:30.477
when they go low, I go high.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.001
That'’s right,
that'’s right.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.916
And that'’s exactly
what I'’m gonna do.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.048
Mm-hmm.No matter what

06:37.092 --> 06:40.225
your backwoods, whitebread,
hillbilly-ass mama has to say.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.491
I can'’t believe
this weather.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.493
In November! [chuckles]

06:46.536 --> 06:47.842
It'’s nice, isn't it?

06:47.885 --> 06:50.105
Grover can play outside
all year round.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.846
That'’s wonderful.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.369
Makes you wonder
why people are always

06:53.413 --> 06:54.849
shooting each other out here.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.853
People shoot
each other out here?

06:58.896 --> 07:01.812
All the time, honey.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.988
Mom, that'’s-that's not true.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.121
It is according to
my news channel.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.123
Well, not according to mine.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.255
You should really try
to watch more than one of them.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.996
Fine. How many
do you watch?

07:12.040 --> 07:15.957
Well, uh, one.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.133
Oh! I brought cookies.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.221
Oh.
[chuckles]

07:19.264 --> 07:20.788
Buddy, just-just
one, okay?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.006
We have dinner later.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.486
Hmm, your daddy
could never stop

07:23.530 --> 07:25.488
at just one.
[chuckles]

07:25.532 --> 07:26.576
In middle school,
we had to shop

07:26.620 --> 07:28.273
in the husky section.

07:30.493 --> 07:34.758
Oh, but look at that chiseled,
handsome face now.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.543
Oh, baby,
your skin is dry.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.153
Are you using moisturizer?

07:38.196 --> 07:41.635
Y-Yes, Mom,
I'’m sufficiently moist.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.463
Well, I hope
it has SPF,

07:43.506 --> 07:44.986
because if it
doesn'’t have SPF,

07:45.029 --> 07:46.204
you'’re gonna end up
with cancer

07:46.248 --> 07:47.728
just like
your Uncle John.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.425
I didn'’t know
Uncle John has cancer.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.383
He had to get his ear removed.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.953
But it went fine,
he had a Jewish doctor.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.389
Mom...

07:57.433 --> 07:59.174
"A Jewish doctor"?

07:59.217 --> 08:02.003
Yes. Everyone knows
they'’re the best.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.395
Although, I now hear
the Indian ones

08:03.439 --> 08:05.528
are catching up.
[sighs]

08:05.572 --> 08:07.051
Hey, Grammy, look.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.705
There'’s my school.
Oh.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.272
The school is pretty great.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.187
Gemma is doing an amazing job.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.058
You know, she just
implemented a new curriculum

08:14.102 --> 08:15.407
that teaches the
kids empathy.

08:15.451 --> 08:18.106
Oh, good for her. Oh, yeah.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.760
The kids have
the rest of their lives

08:19.803 --> 08:21.544
to learn things like
reading and math.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.460
Well, they teach
those things, too.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.114
Oh, I'’m sure they do.

08:26.157 --> 08:30.118
Grover. Can you tell me
the capital of Michigan?

08:30.161 --> 08:32.120
Sure.[iPad beeps]

08:32.163 --> 08:34.339
Siri, what'’s the capital
of Michigan?[iPad beeps]

08:34.383 --> 08:37.734
SIRI: Lansing is
the capital of Michigan.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.344
Hmm, well, at least
he has empathy.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.305
Hey, I'’m sorry, Pop,
but there'’s no way

08:43.348 --> 08:44.828
you'’re not fighting
with Dave'’s mom.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.352
I know. A proud black patriarch
going toe-to-toe

08:47.396 --> 08:48.963
with a loudmouth
Midwestern grandma?

08:49.006 --> 08:51.443
Man, that should be
a pay-per-view match. [laughs]

08:51.487 --> 08:53.489
Or at least a Tyler Perry movie.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.752
[laughing]

08:55.796 --> 08:57.754
Well, prepare to
be disappointed.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.234
Because I'’m not
gonna do anything

08:59.277 --> 09:01.105
to ruin your
mother'’s holiday.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.498
Trust me, boys.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.718
You got to respect the mamas.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.590
Listen to your father;
he'’s right.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.637
'’Cause he knows
if he ruins this day for me,

09:10.680 --> 09:11.899
I'’m leaving him
for your Uncle Curtis

09:11.942 --> 09:14.075
and his boat.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.685
Come on, girl.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.861
You know you can'’t
leave all this.

09:17.905 --> 09:18.906
Come on, now.

09:20.777 --> 09:24.433
So, this is where
you used to live

09:24.476 --> 09:27.697
and this is where you live now.

09:27.741 --> 09:32.223
Far, far away from me.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.486
[sighs]

09:34.530 --> 09:37.098
I miss seeing you
all the time.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.274
Oh, I know honey.

09:39.317 --> 09:42.843
But this is where your mom
and dad decided to move.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.497
For reasons maybe they can
explain to both of us.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.371
Hey, Grover, can you go help
Mommy in the kitchen?

09:49.414 --> 09:51.460
Okay.
[chuckles]

09:51.503 --> 09:54.071
What'’s the capital
of North Dakota?Bismarck.

09:54.115 --> 09:58.554
[laughs] You'’ll thank me
when he gets into college.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.512
Okay, yeah, uh...

10:00.556 --> 10:02.993
Mom, listen; before our
neighbors get here,

10:03.037 --> 10:05.692
I just want to talk to you
about maybe being careful

10:05.735 --> 10:07.650
with some of the
things that you say.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.392
Oh. Is this because
they'’re black?

10:11.523 --> 10:13.700
Yes.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.658
And-and you'’re afraid

10:15.702 --> 10:17.225
I'’m going to say
something rude.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.662
Exactly.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.446
Because they'’re always
so sensitive...
No.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.274
No, Mom. No.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.798
[doorbell rings]

10:24.841 --> 10:27.931
[laughs] It'’ll be fine,
David, I promise you.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.412
You don'’t have to treat me
like I'’m a child.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.587
Okay, you know what?
You'’re right, Mom.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.371
I'’m-I'm sorry.Honestly.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.244
It'’s like you think I don't know
how to talk to the blacks.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.598
♪

10:49.213 --> 10:51.085
Mom, how can you not know
that it'’s wrong

10:51.128 --> 10:52.739
to refer to black people
as "the blacks"?

10:52.782 --> 10:56.177
You live in Michigan,
not the 1950s.

10:56.220 --> 11:00.616
You kids are so darn
politically correct these days.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.792
It'’s like everyone's so worried
about each other'’s feelings.

11:02.836 --> 11:05.099
You say that like
it'’s a bad thing.

11:07.492 --> 11:08.842
I'’m sure they
didn'’t even hear me,

11:08.885 --> 11:10.844
and if they did they
would'’ve said something.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.324
I can'’t believe
you didn'’t say something.

11:13.368 --> 11:16.632
I love your mother very much.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.636
I can'’t believe
she really said that.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.811
I can.

11:23.900 --> 11:27.469
What I can'’t believe is that
Calvin didn'’t lose his cool.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.472
Well, if I were you, I would'’ve
turned right around and left.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.387
Are you kidding?

11:32.430 --> 11:34.737
I'’m sipping wine while a white
lady and her son cook for me.

11:37.218 --> 11:42.266
If my ancestors could
see me now, they'’d be like,

11:42.310 --> 11:45.226
"Look at you, Tina.
You go, girl!"

11:47.837 --> 11:50.013
Okay, I have everyone'’s drinks.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.406
Ooh!
Right.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.625
Yeah.

11:53.669 --> 11:56.106
Damn, Dave,
these are strong.

11:56.150 --> 12:00.241
[coughing]

12:00.284 --> 12:03.984
Yeah, I thought I'’d get ahead
of it and numb everyone'’s pain.

12:04.027 --> 12:07.683
So, I want to know more

12:07.727 --> 12:09.772
about all of you.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.773
Marty, right?Yeah.

12:10.817 --> 12:11.992
Um, what do you do?

12:12.035 --> 12:13.994
Oh, I'’m an engineer at JPL.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.648
Oh, what'’s that?
A-A rap radio station?

12:20.609 --> 12:23.568
Mom, JPL stands for
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.570
That'’s right.
I work on the satellites.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.747
Oh, that'’s impressive.Yeah.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.313
You must have gone
to an excellent school.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.359
I did. USC.Oh.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.840
In fact, Marty had
a full scholarship.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.538
Oh, so does that mean
you were an athlete?

12:36.581 --> 12:37.974
[laughs]

12:38.018 --> 12:39.541
CALVIN:
Paula.

12:39.584 --> 12:40.847
Can I, can I call you Paula?

12:42.413 --> 12:44.807
Assuming that Marty
was an athlete

12:44.851 --> 12:46.853
because he'’s black
and went to college,

12:46.896 --> 12:50.073
well, some people might
consider that a stereotype.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.815
Oh, really? It just seems
that every athlete

12:52.859 --> 12:54.077
I see on my TV is black.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.430
Should'’ve made these stronger.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.389
[chuckling]

13:01.432 --> 13:05.045
I mean, Paula, I mean,
clearly you must know

13:05.088 --> 13:08.048
that not every black man
is an athlete.

13:08.091 --> 13:11.051
Marty'’s scholarship was for
his academic achievements.

13:11.094 --> 13:14.184
Oh. A-A-And what
about you, Malcolm,

13:14.228 --> 13:16.099
did you also get
an academic scholarship?

13:16.143 --> 13:18.014
Nope. [laughs]

13:20.147 --> 13:21.496
I was an athlete.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.022
Just like the ones
you see on TV.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.372
He'’s unemployed, too.

13:33.943 --> 13:37.817
So, Calvin, I couldn'’t help
but notice your truck outside.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.122
I mean, it is beautiful.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.384
Oh, thank you.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.560
Do you do the maintenance
yourself?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.388
Yeah, you know,
I'’ve been taking care of her

13:44.432 --> 13:46.303
ever since she belonged
to my father.

13:46.347 --> 13:50.525
Oh, that'’s great.
You know, us Michiganders,

13:50.568 --> 13:53.745
I mean, we love anyone
who knows his way around a car.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.704
And you know what?
I'’ll drink to that.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.706
Here, here, here.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.403
You know, in fact,

13:59.447 --> 14:02.015
my very first boyfriend,
he was also a grease monkey.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.193
I-I-I ain'’t gonna
be able to do this.

14:06.236 --> 14:09.152
Dad, remember, remember,
respect the mamas.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.243
Calvin, I'’m-I'm
sorry. Mom.

14:13.287 --> 14:16.246
You cannot call Calvin a monkey.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.901
It is an incredibly
offensive term.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.557
I didn'’t call him a monkey.
I called him a grease monkey.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.039
They'’re two totally
different things.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.476
Not the way
you say it.
Mm-mm.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.999
You know what?

14:30.043 --> 14:34.221
I think I'’m gonna go outside
and get some evening air.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.613
It'’s only 12:30.

14:35.657 --> 14:36.876
I know what damn time
it is, Malcolm.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.318
Mom, you need to go outside
and apologize to Calvin.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.710
For what?

14:45.754 --> 14:47.625
Well, for calling him
a grease monkey.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.627
Now, I know you may not
have meant it that way,

14:49.671 --> 14:52.717
but it is still
incredibly offensive.

14:52.761 --> 14:53.936
Fine.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.851
If that'’s what'll
make you happy.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.940
Thank you.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.638
But, honestly, you people
can be so sensitive.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.427
We should do this
every year.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.777
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.213
Calvin,

15:10.257 --> 15:12.172
I owe you an apology.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.390
Oh, thank you.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.652
But if you ask me,

15:14.696 --> 15:16.045
I think you'’re overreacting.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.568
You think I'’m overreacting?

15:17.612 --> 15:19.483
After all that stuff
you said in there?

15:19.527 --> 15:22.051
You mean about thinking
Marty was an athlete?

15:22.095 --> 15:23.705
Why is that such a crime?

15:23.748 --> 15:26.882
Please, let'’s not start
talking about crime.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.840
Let me tell you
why, Paula.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.973
Because everything you think
you know about black people

15:31.017 --> 15:32.540
is a stereotype.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.195
Oh, maybe, but in my experience,

15:35.238 --> 15:37.632
most stereotypes
are rooted in the truth.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.591
Here I am standing
right here in front of you

15:40.635 --> 15:43.333
telling you that they'’re not,
yet you won'’t listen.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.987
Oh, I listen.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.771
Yeah, to fake news.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.948
Oh, you listen to fake news.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.471
Oh, no, yours is faker.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.821
No, I'’m sorry,
yours is much faker.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.519
[overlapping arguing]Will you both please shut up?

15:58.087 --> 16:01.221
Did he just tell
his mother to shut up?

16:01.264 --> 16:04.659
Did he just tell
Calvin to shut up?

16:04.702 --> 16:07.967
I'’m done joking.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.231
I'’m-a sell this to pay-per-view.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.754
You need to stay
out of this, Dave.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.582
We'’re just having
a conversation.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.192
She just saying what she thinks.

16:16.236 --> 16:19.239
Yes, but what she
thinks is awful.

16:19.282 --> 16:22.938
I have a right to my opinions.
Don'’t talk about me like that.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.636
Oh, you mean like the way
you talk about other people?

16:25.680 --> 16:28.074
It'’s like you don't care
if what you say hurts them.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.511
You know, that'’s exactly
what I was trying to say, Paula.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.078
[stammers]

16:32.121 --> 16:34.080
Everyone'’s just so sensitive
these days.

16:34.123 --> 16:37.822
You know, I can actually agree
with you about that.

16:37.866 --> 16:42.653
Yes, Mom, it'’s everyone else's
fault for being so sensitive.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.830
It'’s probably from
teaching empathy.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.181
I don'’t understand, Mom,

16:48.224 --> 16:51.532
how someone who I love so much,

16:51.575 --> 16:54.361
who I know deep down
is a good person,

16:54.404 --> 16:58.017
can say such ignorant
and embarrassing things as you.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.500
I'’m sorry you feel that way
about your mother.

17:05.415 --> 17:06.938
Now if you'’ll
excuse me...

17:09.202 --> 17:10.594
Oh, shoot, here she comes!

17:10.638 --> 17:12.292
[all exclaiming]

17:17.340 --> 17:18.907
I'’m sorry if I offended
any of you.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.518
That was never my intention.

17:21.562 --> 17:25.087
So, if you'’ll excuse me,
I'’m gonna go pack my bags.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.046
Wait, no, no, no, no, no. Paula,
Paula, please don'’t leave.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.743
You'’re family.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.659
Yeah, Grammy,
I don'’t want you to go.

17:31.702 --> 17:35.358
I know, honey, but clearly

17:35.402 --> 17:37.969
your father doesn'’t
want me here, so...

17:38.013 --> 17:40.320
I guess now we know why
you moved so far away.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.889
Dave,

17:44.933 --> 17:46.717
you can'’t talk to
your mother like that.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.110
You need to chill, man.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.633
Are you really defending her?

17:49.677 --> 17:51.374
Oh, I'’ll do
more than that.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.637
If she wanted to whup you,
I would hold you down.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.639
Look.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.554
She'’s just speaking
her mind, man.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.253
It'’s not her fault
that she is wildly misinformed.

18:01.950 --> 18:05.780
Misinformed? She'’s worse
than misinformed.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.826
Yeah, well, at least with her
you know where you stand.

18:08.870 --> 18:11.873
Yes, and because of that,
I wore a T-shirt in the pool

18:11.916 --> 18:13.570
until I was
18 years old.

18:16.225 --> 18:19.881
Trust me, Dave, you'’re better
off knowing what someone thinks.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.492
It'’s when you don't is when
they could sneak up on you.

18:22.536 --> 18:25.191
When who sneaks
up on you?

18:25.234 --> 18:28.237
The people that can
hurt you most.

18:28.281 --> 18:31.458
Like a son telling his mom
she embarrasses him.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.155
Yeah, but she does.

18:33.199 --> 18:36.115
It doesn'’t matter.
She gave you life, man.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.074
She deserves
your respect.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.165
Look, Paula is who she is,
she'’s not gonna change.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.472
But she'’s also not gonna
be around forever.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.778
And when she'’s not?

18:47.822 --> 18:50.172
I don'’t care how much
she embarrasses you,

18:50.216 --> 18:52.783
you gonna miss her like you
never missed anybody before.

18:56.526 --> 18:59.050
Sounds like you know
what you'’re talking about.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.879
I do.
I miss my mother every day.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.406
When did she pass?

19:06.449 --> 19:07.755
Oh, she didn'’t pass.

19:09.583 --> 19:14.196
No, she just travels around the
world with my brother, Curtis.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.459
He has to
buy her love.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.724
Well, now I feel like a jerk.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.597
Well, look,
you'’ll be fine, man.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.469
Just go in there
and apologize,

19:26.513 --> 19:29.342
let her know she'’s the most
important woman in your life,

19:29.385 --> 19:31.692
and that you'’ll love her
no matter what.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.002
You think she'’ll
forgive me?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.830
Of course, man.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.877
I mean, just tell her the only
reason that you yelled at her

19:42.920 --> 19:44.835
is that you'’ve been living
around all these black people

19:44.879 --> 19:45.967
and they made you crazy.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.455
I'’m glad you decided
to stay, Grammy.

19:55.498 --> 20:00.634
Aw, well, I'’m glad your
father convinced me to.

20:00.677 --> 20:04.420
I'’ve never seen your mom change
her mind. How'’d you do it?

20:04.464 --> 20:06.030
Well, I just told her the truth.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.597
I said, even though
we fight sometimes,

20:07.641 --> 20:10.426
she'’s still my mom
and I'’ll always love her.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.254
And that was enough?

20:12.298 --> 20:14.387
No.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.866
She also thought her Uber driver

20:15.910 --> 20:17.390
looked like a terrorist
she saw on TV.

20:20.741 --> 20:22.743
You know, Gemma,
this food is really delicious.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.440
Yeah, Gemma,
for a skinny white girl,

20:24.484 --> 20:26.225
you sure can burn
like you black.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.183
[laughter]

20:28.227 --> 20:31.142
Oh.
You know what,
I'’d like to make a toast.

20:31.186 --> 20:35.886
To the Johnson and
the Butler families,

20:35.930 --> 20:37.932
two families that have a lot
to be thankful for.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.240
And even though

20:41.283 --> 20:43.459
we don'’t always
see eye to eye,

20:43.503 --> 20:47.550
it'’s good to know that
if we communicate honestly,

20:47.594 --> 20:49.596
we can always find
common ground.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.729
Here, here.

20:52.773 --> 20:53.687
[overlapping talking]

20:53.730 --> 20:55.166
I would just like to add to...

20:55.210 --> 20:56.733
EVERYONE ELSE:
No, no, no, no, no, no!
