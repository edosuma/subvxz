WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:04.534
(tapping)

00:04.588 --> 00:08.126
J‘ Thought you heard the moon J‘

00:08.175 --> 00:11.167
J‘ Laughing right at you J‘

00:11.220 --> 00:12.335
Hey.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.213
All right.

00:16.892 --> 00:17.881
How's this?

00:17.935 --> 00:20.176
- It's fine if you go like this.
- Oh, come on.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.639
We should have borrowed a level.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.475
Well, and I'm telling you,
I've got a good eye, okay?

00:24.525 --> 00:25.514
It's like a superpower for me.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.807
I can hang things straight all day.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.521
(chuckles) Maybe two drinks ago.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.528
But I am impressed.
You've lived here five months--

00:31.573 --> 00:32.688
- Four.
- Whatever.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.572
But tonight you finally made a decision,

00:34.618 --> 00:37.701
and you nailed it down.
You're living with it happily,

00:37.746 --> 00:40.158
- kinda like with Homicide Luke.
- Mm.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.072
Took you a while to settle in there--

00:42.125 --> 00:44.411
couple of nights of dinin' and dashin',

00:44.461 --> 00:46.452
a little, "Should I? Shouldn't l?"

00:46.505 --> 00:48.166
But now you're living with it happily.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.250
Yeah.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.005
Yeah, I hooked up with Sam.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.382
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.292
Um, I mean, I didn't sleep with him.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.712
- I totally would have.
- When?

00:56.765 --> 00:57.880
The night of the blackout.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.139
Why didn't you?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.766
Because... the lights came on.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.645
I shouldn't te|| Luke?

01:05.691 --> 01:07.682
You went to the guy's cabin for sexy time.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.235
You are not telling him now.

01:09.278 --> 01:12.270
God, they used to call me a slut.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.530
And I'm assuming that this thing
that happened with Swarek,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.817
your training officer, was a mistake,

01:17.869 --> 01:18.949
because you didn't tell me.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.738
Yeah, best mistake of my life.
(chuckles)

01:21.790 --> 01:24.406
Yes, Traci, it was a mistake.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.074
Things with Sam are complicated,

01:26.128 --> 01:29.120
and with Luke, they're just--they're simple.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.208
I mean, he cares about me, I care about him,

01:31.258 --> 01:33.214
and I do want to make it work.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.750
Okay, then. Write his name down.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.260
- Who?
- Sam Swarek.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.421
Okay.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.384
And drop it in thejar.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.932
Nowjust put it in, 'cause, honey,
you gotta suck it up.

01:45.981 --> 01:49.599
Put Sam Swarek on ice.
Forget the blackout ever happened.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.187
Go ahead.
Put him in the freezer.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.775
That simple, huh?

01:56.825 --> 01:58.235
Well, you want to make it work with Luke...

01:58.285 --> 01:59.650
- Yeah.
- You gotta step it up.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.490
If I were you, now is the time
I would become girlfriend of the year.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.699
Girlfriend of the year?

02:03.749 --> 02:05.080
Fake it till you make it.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.911
(sighs)

02:06.960 --> 02:10.873
(siren wailing in distance)

02:10.922 --> 02:12.298
What is a man?

02:12.341 --> 02:15.378
A miserable pile of secrets.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.507
Good news for us--

02:16.553 --> 02:18.669
secrets are meant to be broken.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.178
I think you mean promises.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.724
Same thing.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.851
Mr. Acoustic on Yonge Street
promised he'd been robbed,

02:25.896 --> 02:28.057
promised he'd conveniently received

02:28.106 --> 02:29.391
a massive shipment of electronics

02:29.441 --> 02:30.772
right before said robbery,

02:30.817 --> 02:32.773
but promised he could not find
the paperwork.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.401
I promised him we'd look into it.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.188
You think he faked the robbery?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.573
- I do.
- And you want us to put that together?

02:40.619 --> 02:43.782
Come on. It“ be fun, kinda like
doing a-a big jigsaw puzzle

02:43.830 --> 02:46.116
up at a, I don't know, a fishing cabin.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.533
Speed trap. Trap of the speed.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.542
Wow. It's gonna be gripping.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.954
Oh, did--did you wanna switch, Gail?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.338
- (laughs) No.
- Can't. Assignments have already been called.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.841
Oh, please, God,
give me a high-speed pursuit.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.217
I haven't driven over 50 on this job.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.468
It's getting embarrassing.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.845
Epstein, you ready to roll?

03:01.890 --> 03:02.879
Rolling, sir.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.264
Peck, Diaz, you're working together.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.174
Same car, nothing fancy.
You're gonna run the beam.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.638
Epstein and l are gonna ree| 'em in

03:07.688 --> 03:09.303
and hand out the zingers.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.596
You and me, huh?

03:12.943 --> 03:14.183
So?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.561
I'm just saying.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.151
(Chris) You and me.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.583
Just remember to point it directly
at the car you're targeting, all right?

03:34.631 --> 03:35.711
Yeah, I know how to use it.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.048
Okay, I wasjust--
just trying to be helpful.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.301
Yeah, you've been really helpful lately.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.961
(hip-hop playing loudly)
Get this guy.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.765
Officer Shaw,
we got a yellow 2-door coming at you,

03:46.810 --> 03:48.550
right lane, doing 74.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.391
Okay, I get it.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.429
Get what?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.063
What this is about--

03:54.109 --> 03:56.725
reporting your brother's partner
to Internal Affairs.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.564
| get that you're angry about that.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.604
- Chris--
- But you know what, Gail?

04:00.657 --> 04:04.070
I've thought about it a lot,
and here's where I'm at.

04:04.119 --> 04:07.532
One, I didn't report your brother.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.742
I reported his partner. Okay?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.248
And two, that's the kind of cop
I wanna be, you know?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.534
I wanna do the right thing.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.374
And--And three,
I thought you'd respect that.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.914
Okay, and H think we can
move past this, together.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.004
That's what I think.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.465
So you figured that all out by yourself?

04:25.682 --> 04:26.888
Okay.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.389
All right.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.766
(hip-hop playing loudly)
(man) Look, I know

04:29.811 --> 04:31.017
- l was going a little over--
- Yeah, turn that down.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.438
Turn that down.
(volume decreases)

04:32.481 --> 04:34.893
But see, the thing is,
is I got a big, big job interview, right,

04:34.941 --> 04:36.647
so I don't want--| don't want
to be late for that.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.024
Yeah, what time's the job interview?

04:38.069 --> 04:41.482
12...
12:50 is what they told me,

04:41.531 --> 04:42.941
but, I mean, if I go now,

04:42.991 --> 04:45.073
I could probablyjust... just nail it.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.449
Yeah? What kind ofjob?

04:46.495 --> 04:49.407
Project manager

04:49.456 --> 04:51.321
for s--for projects.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.114
You always go to job interviews
with your hockey shirt on?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.783
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.168
Good luck with that.
You drive safe now.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.203
(man) Thank you.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.633
(mock whining)
"Oh, officer, please.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.542
"My speedometer's busted.
My wife's in labor.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.301
I got the runs.
Blah, blah, blah."

05:05.347 --> 05:06.462
You ever let 'em off?

05:06.515 --> 05:08.130
Yeah, once.
There was this guy who was late

05:08.183 --> 05:09.969
for his tenth wedding anniversary.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.974
He was sweating bullets
and, uh, even had

05:12.020 --> 05:14.011
the--the diamond earrings
sitting there in the--

05:14.064 --> 05:16.430
in the seat next to him--
cutest little blue box.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.939
I wouldn't have pegged you
as a romantic.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.099
Yeah, you kidding?

05:19.152 --> 05:22.189
Hearts and flowers, Epstein,
all the way.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.979
Whatever my girl wants--

05:24.032 --> 05:27.524
babies, a new roof, more babies.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.990
(sighs) Secret to a happy life, my friend.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.870
Secret to a happy life.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.911
You know what, Gail?

05:35.961 --> 05:38.668
If there's something you want me to say,
then let me know, okay?

05:38.713 --> 05:40.840
'Cause I'm tired of guessin'.
It's as simple as--

05:40.882 --> 05:42.213
Okay, did it ever occur to you,

05:42.259 --> 05:43.999
Mr. "I've got it all figured out,"

05:44.052 --> 05:46.008
that this isn't just about you?

05:46.054 --> 05:48.045
Uh, sir, we got a red truck
and a gray 2-door

05:48.098 --> 05:49.383
that swept by at warp nine.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.717
All right, we're on it.
Did you get a plate?

05:50.767 --> 05:51.973
Uh, no, sir.
They were moving way too fast.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.260
Car's tango-6-whiskey-4-delta-4.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.894
(Oliver) Nice work, bright eyes.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.055
All right, let's go.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.724
(horn honks in distance)

06:02.779 --> 06:04.815
(sighs)

06:09.411 --> 06:11.823
(tires skid)

06:11.872 --> 06:12.987
You trying to make me look like an idiot?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.700
I'm not trying to do anything, sweetie.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.535
I can see that, loud and clear.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.247
(tires skid, crash)

06:22.799 --> 06:28.544
(siren wailing)

06:28.597 --> 06:29.757
(siren stops)

06:34.019 --> 06:35.850
- (Chris) What happened?
- (Dov) I don't know.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.136
We were right about to chase 'em.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.270
Then all of a sudden,
the screeching tires, then this.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.233
Don't move her. I'm gonna call
an ambulance right now.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.769
You go and you check that truck.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.736
- (Oliver) Dispatch, 1505.
- But there's no one here!

06:50.785 --> 06:51.945
Check the floor.
Check the ground.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.235
They might have been thrown.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.246
1505. I need an ambulance
at Garrison and Lake Shore right away.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.576
(woman on radio) Copy, 1505.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.116
- Sir, there's no one in it!
- EMS is en route.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.376
There's gotta be!
We were right behind him!

07:01.421 --> 07:02.581
No, there isn't!

07:02.631 --> 07:04.917
(siren wailing in distance)

07:07.844 --> 07:09.084
(Andy) This is ridiculous.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.172
(Traci) Don't even.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.599
Coffee.

07:13.642 --> 07:14.882
Thank you.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.597
Do you like artichokes?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.603
- Not in my coffee.
- Well, I mean,

07:20.649 --> 07:22.514
there'd obviously be
hollandaise sauce for dipping

07:22.567 --> 07:26.230
and steak and
cream cheese mashed potatoes.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.314
Where?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.604
My house.

07:28.657 --> 07:29.692
You're the salad-in-a-bag lady.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.606
- Not always.
- Pretty well always.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.571
Well, not tonight.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.952
Look, you don't know everything about me.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.612
(chuckles) Okay.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.406
Okay, are you in?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.040
Hollandaise? Hell, yeah.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.461
Nice.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.625
Pfft!

07:49.678 --> 07:52.135
Girlfriend of the year.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.340
(laughs)

07:53.390 --> 07:56.382
(sirens wailing)

08:03.191 --> 08:04.306
(Chris) We didn't find anything.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.439
Hey, any luck with the plates?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.601
Oliver's running them now.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.191
Sir, did you find anything in the truck?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.276
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.316
The truck's plates just went out in the system

08:15.370 --> 08:17.406
as part of a citywide AMBER Alert.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.161
Apparently, 8:30 this morning,

08:19.207 --> 08:21.539
security cameras recorded
a 9-year-old girl

08:21.584 --> 08:22.573
getting into this truck.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.208
She has not been seen since.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.457
Guys, this isn'tjust an accident.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.622
This is a child abduction.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.887
Her name is Rebecca Leigh--

08:39.936 --> 08:42.222
9 years old, on her way to school,

08:42.272 --> 08:45.856
caught on camera getting into this truck

08:45.900 --> 08:48.858
on the corner of Parliament and Winchester,
8:33 AM.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.646
Now the truck is registered
to Connor Chapman, 38.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.235
- Priors?
- Oh, yeah, he's on the list--

08:54.284 --> 08:56.741
two counts sexual assault on a minor,
one with a weapon.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.287
This is the real deal.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.162
Now Noelle is handing out info packages
containing known associates,

09:01.207 --> 09:03.869
last known address,
everything we got so far.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.126
Okay, guys, we are going to assume
that she's still alive.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.039
Otherwise, he probably would've left her
at the accident site.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.422
But let me remind you--

09:11.468 --> 09:13.333
every minute that this girl is missing

09:13.386 --> 09:15.593
increases the chance
we're gonna find her...

09:16.931 --> 09:19.263
Right. You guys know the deal.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.675
Noelle, let's--let's get this done.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.470
Detective Barber will be running this
from the D's office.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.387
We're getting investigative help from HQ,

09:26.441 --> 09:29.183
more uniforms from 18 and 36,
including K9.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.817
In the meantime, we'll be searching
the immediate area.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.146
Stay alert. Stay on your radios.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.031
Serve, protect,
and let's find this girl now.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.281
(Oliver) Yeah. You got that?

09:44.334 --> 09:47.121
I'm gonna send Peck and Diaz
west from the LKP.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.786
All right, let's go. Let's go.
I am gonna be in my car.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.500
I'll be spinning the area.
You two are gonna search on foot.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.834
You're gonna stay on-scene.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.715
Uh, sir, I'd rather search, if that's okay.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.503
No, not up for discussion.
You gotta wait here until ldent is finished,

09:57.555 --> 09:59.762
then go over to Memorial and get
a statement from that woman.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.675
All right, Epstein, you gotta figure out
if she's connected to this, okay?

10:03.686 --> 10:05.551
Okay, off you go.
Maybe we catch this creep.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.640
Yes, sir.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.678
(Oliver) Get goin'!

10:07.732 --> 10:10.474
(helicopter hovering overhead)

10:11.861 --> 10:13.943
(truck horn blares)

10:13.988 --> 10:15.853
Bam! l smash into a pole.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.239
I'm going north, away from the lake.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.240
- Yeah.
- I've got a little girl with me,

10:20.286 --> 10:23.699
so, you know, I'm obviously hiding,
trying to get my bearings.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.206
Hey, what was the description
on the girl's clothes again?

10:27.252 --> 10:30.744
It's a plaid...
peacoat and a pink bag.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.459
(train wheels clacking)

10:44.978 --> 10:46.889
(Gail) Hey!

10:46.938 --> 10:48.519
Where'd you get that bag?

10:49.691 --> 10:50.931
Oh, yeah, go right ahead.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.770
Homeless guy doesn't need a backpack.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.434
What's he gonna put in it anyway, right?

10:55.989 --> 10:56.978
Want anything else?

10:57.031 --> 10:58.237
- My shoes, you like those?
- Hey.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.649
I'm gonna ask you again.
Where'd you get the bag?

11:00.702 --> 11:01.987
Right over there. I don't know,

11:02.036 --> 11:03.572
like, ten minutes ago.
It was just lying there.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.077
Yeah, you sure about that?

11:05.123 --> 11:07.239
Yeah, I'm living the life.
Why would I lie?

11:08.877 --> 11:10.287
You know what? So sue me.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.997
I don't trust anybody
with after-shave on his breath.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.707
Oh, yeah?
Who do you trust, Gail?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.718
(Gail sighs)

11:24.767 --> 11:27.304
(panting)

11:27.353 --> 11:30.390
(Jerry) I'm looking through it now.
Yeah. Did you get anything?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.271
Well, what about the traffic cameras?

11:32.317 --> 11:34.023
I need everything that we can get on this.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.935
Jerry, Ben Leigh's here.
Noelle's bringing him in the front door.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.023
Rebecca's dad?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.523
No, I don't care if you stick
wings up your ass and you fly.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.532
You get that footage here right now.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.988
(slams down receiver)

11:45.038 --> 11:47.700
(sighs) Okay, where's the mother?
We need to be the first

11:47.749 --> 11:49.660
to tell the parents about Chapman,
not the news.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.994
I thought she'd be with the dad.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.580
No, they're divorced.
They're barely speaking.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.869
Wait a minute.
We don't have the mother?

11:53.922 --> 11:55.082
No.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.213
Okay, call her.
Tell her we're gonna pick her up.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.045
But, Traci, nothing about Chapman
until she gets here.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.302
(Andy) Yes. Okay. Bye.
Hey, that was Peck and Diaz.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.555
Looks like they might have found
some of Rebecca's clothes.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.965
ldent's already heading over.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.100
So Chapman's ditching anything
that identifies her,

12:09.145 --> 12:10.385
screws up our description.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.644
That's just what we need.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.806
Okay, Sammy, we got the dad coming in.
I want you to handle it.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.440
- Just until I can strateg--
- (Noelle) Detective Barber.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.528
Mr. Leigh, Detective Jerry Barber.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.950
Uh, Ben's fine. It's nice to meet you.
Listen, uh--

12:22.992 --> 12:24.857
Look, we're--we're--we're on it.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.527
Okay, we are all on it--
all these people.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.911
We're doing everything that we can.

12:28.957 --> 12:29.946
Thank you.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.079
Now we're gonna be sending over

12:31.125 --> 12:32.251
a couple of officers to pick up your wife--

12:32.293 --> 12:34.909
your--your ex-wife right now.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.251
Officer Williams,
if you would take Officer Nash.

12:38.299 --> 12:42.008
Uh, uh, well, someone will stay there, right,
in case Rebecca shows up?

12:44.514 --> 12:45.799
Yeah, we're on it.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.837
(Noelle) Nash.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.631
Okay, Sammy. Excuse me.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.346
Mr. Leigh, l'm Officer Swarek.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.262
Let's get you settled
somewhere a little more private.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.350
This is Officer McNally.
She'll bejoining us today.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.389
Nice to meet you.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.603
Anything you need?
Coffee? Water?

12:58.653 --> 12:59.813
Um...

13:01.823 --> 13:02.983
Who is that?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.988
- (clears throat)
- Is he the one who took her?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.195
Uh, we can talk about that in here, Mr. Leigh.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.745
Um, just please come this way, sir.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.122
(doorbell rings)

13:13.167 --> 13:15.158
(Noelle) Figures we're the ones
sent to baby-sit the house.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.874
Crappy details like this,
guys always send the women.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.163
Jerry's not like that.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.626
(dialing cell phone)

13:21.676 --> 13:22.836
Yeah, well, you'd know.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.673
Kathryn Leigh?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.009
Uh, yeah. Sorry. lwasjust...

13:29.058 --> 13:30.343
Wait. What's happening? Did you--

13:30.393 --> 13:31.428
- Have you--
- Can we come in, ma'am?

13:32.687 --> 13:33.927
I'm sorry. Please come in.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.054
l'm Officer Williams.
This is Officer Nash.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.848
Hi.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.233
Please tell me that you found her.
Please.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.645
Uh, there's no sign of Rebecca yet,
ma'am, but we're here

13:43.698 --> 13:45.188
to make sure you get down
to the station right away.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.653
They can fill you in better from there.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.238
No.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.573
I mean, what if Rebecca comes home
and I'm not here?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.408
I mean, I need to clean up.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.575
Don't want the place to be a mess
when she comes home.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.619
Well, Officer Williams and I
will be right here,

13:59.672 --> 14:03.085
and, uh, and we'll keep you posted.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.500
There's someone waiting out front
to take you right now.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.054
Well, I can't go like this.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.970
Mrs. Leigh, you look fine.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.891
(keys jangle)

14:26.866 --> 14:31.155
(children shouting indistinctly,
dog barking in distance)

14:31.204 --> 14:32.284
(Traci) Wow.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.447
She doesn't even really seem that upset.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.910
Don'tjudge her.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.667
Do notjudge her.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.919
Ten years on this job, one thing I learned--

14:41.964 --> 14:43.579
grief looks different on everybody.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.935
Excuse me. Can I help you?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.891
Officer Dov Epstein.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.307
This woman may be involved
in a child abduction.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.646
Edith, huh?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.151
She okay?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.403
(nurse) Mild concussion.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.734
Don't know how long she'll be asleep.

15:09.784 --> 15:10.864
| just need a statement.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.697
I'll wait.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.033
Looks like you got the fun job, huh?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.828
(Sam) We're running down every
known address of Chapman's,

15:23.881 --> 15:26.463
anyone who might have talked to him
since he got out of prison.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.090
But you're sure it's him?

15:28.136 --> 15:30.548
That's what we're assuming for now.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.177
Is he gonna hurt her?

15:33.808 --> 15:36.424
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you,

15:36.477 --> 15:39.139
but if there's anything you can tell us,

15:39.188 --> 15:41.770
anything at all,
especially about this morning,

15:41.816 --> 15:42.805
that might help.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.145
Uh, we share custody.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.527
| get Rebecca every other week.
I didn't see her.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.485
So Rebecca was with you
this morning, Mrs. Leigh?

15:51.534 --> 15:55.447
Yes. Uh, uh, we got up.
I got her dressed.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.736
I made her breakfast.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.871
Okay. Can you tell us
what she was wearing?

15:58.916 --> 16:00.952
Well, yeah. I mean,
you saw it on the tape, right?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.788
She had on her plaid coat.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.874
I'm sorry. I meant, uh,
underneath the coat, Mrs. Leigh.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.538
Well, her jacket was discarded,

16:07.592 --> 16:09.833
so it'd be helpful to know what
she was wearing underneath.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.923
Excuse me. Are--Are you saying
she doesn't have herjacket?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.429
I mean, it's freezing out there.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.591
I don't remember.
I mean, she's very independent.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.929
She dresses herself.
She walks herself to school.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.765
Rebecca walks to school by herself?

16:21.814 --> 16:25.477
Well, yeah, sometimes. I...

16:25.526 --> 16:28.188
We have a difference of opinion
on a lot of things.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.852
That's one of the reasons why...

16:31.491 --> 16:34.654
Well, Ben walks Rebecca
to school every morning,

16:34.702 --> 16:37.239
but Rebecca hates it,
because she wants to be a big girl.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.653
And so a few weeks ago,

16:38.706 --> 16:41.118
I figured the school is only
a few blocks from our house.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.749
I mean, I walked myself to school
when l was her age, so--

16:43.794 --> 16:47.503
Me, too. I mean, a lot of parents
let their kids walk to school alone.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.422
Well, lots don't.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.797
We've told her a million times--
you--you don't talk to strangers,

16:53.846 --> 16:55.586
you don't get into cars.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.176
Maybe it wasn't a stranger.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.011
Like you said, we've seen the tape.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.972
Rebecca didn't look coerced.
Any other adults in her life,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.262
people she might take a ride from?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.896
Ma'am?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.984
I'm gonna ask you that again. Okay?

17:10.029 --> 17:13.613
Are you both telling me you have
no friends, no relatives,

17:13.658 --> 17:16.616
nobody new in your lives
Rebecca might take a ride from?

17:16.661 --> 17:18.447
(Jerry) Excuse me, folks.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.952
Sam, you got a minute?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.620
(Sam) Could you give us a minute,
please, folks?

17:25.670 --> 17:28.082
(Jerry) McNally.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.622
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

17:31.676 --> 17:32.711
What's the idea in there?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.045
- What are you doing?
- Jerry. Jerry.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.631
A huge majority of child abductions

17:35.680 --> 17:37.762
are committed by someone
who knows the child.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.047
Okay, what's the idea here?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.386
- He thinks they're lying.
- About what?

17:41.435 --> 17:43.892
We've got video of the kid
getting into this guy's truck.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.144
- It's not the parents, Sammy.
- All right.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.429
That doesn't mean they're not involved.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.813
The Bevilacqua case.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.598
That's totally a different situation.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.647
Come here.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.687
There's something here, Jerry, okay?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.821
She doesn't remember
what her kid was wearing? Really?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.481
- So?
- She's not a cop.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.025
I mean, she's not gonna remember
every little detail.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.114
I don't care who you are.
You try to remember something.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.199
You struggle. You think about it.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.706
"Brown pants" or "her favorite shirt's
got a heart on it."

18:05.751 --> 18:08.663
That woman's got nothing.
How come she remembers nothing?

18:09.714 --> 18:10.749
Okay.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.094
Luke, you got a minute?
Sammy needs some advice.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.256
Thanks.
(hangs up receiver)

18:21.309 --> 18:22.765
All right, you know what? Don't--

18:22.810 --> 18:25.927
|--| got everybody and their cousin
looking at this thing.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.596
Okay? And I don't want
a civil suit on my hands.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.106
These people might actually
be telling the truth.

18:31.152 --> 18:34.189
- Okay.
- All I'm asking is that you talk to Callaghan,

18:34.238 --> 18:35.774
you bring him up to speed on the case

18:35.823 --> 18:38.986
before you go in
with your guns blazing. Please.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.910
(Sam sighs)

18:42.955 --> 18:44.661
What's the Bevilacqua case?

18:44.707 --> 18:47.790
First big one I worked as a rookie--
a reported child abduction,

18:47.835 --> 18:49.541
parents were devastated,
beside themselves.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.293
I believed them.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.170
We found their son, a 4-year-old boy,

18:53.215 --> 18:54.876
in Dad's hockey bag in the basement.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.335
Jeez.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.966
You wanna get to the truth,

18:58.012 --> 19:00.719
sometimes you gotta get rough,
get your hands dirty.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.926
Secrets don't come out
all neat and tidy, Andy.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.011
Kinda surprised you haven't
figured that out by now.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.497
(Luke) You gonna keep 'em together?

19:28.542 --> 19:29.793
Yeah, I thought I might.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.951
They're already starting
to turn on each other.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.586
Apparently it was an ugly split, so...

19:34.632 --> 19:36.918
I don't know. I'd separate 'em.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.468
And stay sympathetic,
general questions.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.626
Just watch the body language.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.544
Oh, body language, huh.
That's good.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.557
Did you get a baseline on how they act
when they're not threatened?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.558
(scoffs) Too late for that.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.310
(Luke) It's too bad.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.567
(sighs) Keep the questions to this morning.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.694
If the story changes, give me a call.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.240
Good luck.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.110
(door closes)

20:08.082 --> 20:11.666
Right now we're partners, okay?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.042
And I'm still your training officer,

20:13.087 --> 20:14.702
so you don't roll your eyes at me.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.256
You don't question my methods.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.799
Yes, sir.

20:17.842 --> 20:18.922
You got a problem with that?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.547
How do you want to do this?

20:22.596 --> 20:23.847
I'm gonna talk to the dad,

20:23.889 --> 20:25.174
and you're gonna take her
into the squad room

20:25.224 --> 20:26.213
and wait for me there.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.885
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.019
You won't even look
at the girl's picture?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.566
I told you so many times already.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.769
Look, there is an AMBER Alert
right now. Please.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.104
Hey. Is everything all right?

20:38.154 --> 20:40.145
I haven't seen him!
If! haven't seen him,

20:40.197 --> 20:42.062
- how could I see her?
- That's not what I asked you.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.903
l have to work.
I'm sorry, but I have to.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.615
Can |? Please? I'm sorry.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.416
He gave the same answer
as everyone else,

20:51.459 --> 20:52.744
and I didn't smell any after-shave.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.909
Yeah? Then what the hell
is he so sorry about?

20:56.464 --> 20:58.295
(telephone ringing)

20:58.340 --> 21:01.252
My mind is just racing, you know?

21:01.302 --> 21:02.417
Have a seat.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.633
All the things I should have
said to her this morning...

21:06.682 --> 21:10.140
"You're my beautiful girl.
I love you so much."

21:10.186 --> 21:11.676
Just--Why didn't I walk her to school?

21:11.729 --> 21:13.435
I should havejust walked her to school.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.516
It's not your fault.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.476
Yes, it is. That's the thing.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.434
You know, I wish I could
just turn it back,

21:20.488 --> 21:24.322
rewind, start over,
do everything right this time,

21:24.366 --> 21:26.982
clean, fresh, you know,
mother of the year.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.364
Are we allowed to sit down?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.203
I don't want to disturb any evidence.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.664
They've already searched the house, Nash.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.578
This ain't "CSl," all right?

21:39.632 --> 21:42.089
Right now, the parents aren't suspects,

21:42.134 --> 21:44.671
so if you want to sit down, sit down.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.506
We're gonna be here a while.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.641
Oh, man, she is a cute kid.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.392
Yeah, well, they always are.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.981
I said you could take a seat.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.267
I didn't say you could snoop
through their stuff.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.821
But what if it's relevant?
What if there's--

22:02.863 --> 22:04.854
Right now we're here
to watch the woman's house

22:04.907 --> 22:06.397
in case the kid shows up, all right?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.987
We're not here to build a--Ow!

22:09.036 --> 22:10.151
You all right? What's wrong?

22:10.204 --> 22:11.614
I'm fine. I'm fine. lt'sjust--

22:11.664 --> 22:14.406
ljust--| just have a headache,
all right? That's all.

22:15.709 --> 22:19.873
Driver's license number
3-0-8—4-9-2.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.334
Yes, that's it. Edith Larson.

22:22.383 --> 22:24.123
Possession?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.757
What for?

22:25.803 --> 22:28.636
Weed? Whatever.
Anything else?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.217
Excuse me.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.427
Uh, Edith Larson.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.684
"Edie," please. I hate "Edith."

22:35.729 --> 22:37.060
What am I doing here?

22:37.106 --> 22:39.392
You were in an accident on Lake Shore.
Do you remember?

22:39.441 --> 22:42.433
God. Am I okay?

22:42.486 --> 22:43.771
I'm okay, right?

22:43.821 --> 22:46.153
You're fine. Do you know a man
named Connor Chapman?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.779
Um...

22:47.825 --> 22:49.941
Connor Chapman or Rebecca Leigh?

22:49.994 --> 22:51.530
I need you to focus, Edith.

22:51.579 --> 22:54.366
(scoffs) I'm sorry.
ljust woke up in a hospital bed.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.825
Can you give me a second?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.536
We don't have a second.
There's a little girl missing,

22:57.585 --> 22:59.291
and I think you know
something about it.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.588
Yeah, I know about it.
l was chasing them.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.796
Chasing them?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.331
Yeah.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.876
I saw the license plate
on one of those...

23:08.929 --> 23:12.387
those... (sighs)

23:12.433 --> 23:15.596
electronic billboards
that they have over the highway.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.886
This truck starts passing me--
same plate number.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.054
Couldn't believe it.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.768
lwas trying to dial 911.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.182
l was trying to keep up.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.816
You were chasing that truck?

23:24.862 --> 23:26.227
Is that weird?

23:26.280 --> 23:29.613
No. No, I mean, it's, uh, a little kamikaze,

23:29.658 --> 23:31.273
but I like your style.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.693
The driver--the guy--

23:33.746 --> 23:36.158
the man who was driving the truck--
what was he wearing?

23:36.206 --> 23:38.117
It's important.
We need a description.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.158
It wasn't a guy.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.461
What are you talking about?

23:41.503 --> 23:43.459
The driver--
the person in the truck--

23:43.505 --> 23:46.463
the person I was chasing--
it was a woman.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.845
(Jerry) Tell me again.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.882
According to my witness,
the driver was a woman,

23:55.935 --> 23:58.722
Caucasian, mid-30s,
light brown hair.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.103
Long hair. Down to here.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.854
Long hair, apparently.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.437
Sounds like Rebecca's mom.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.647
Epstein, you sure
your witness is reliable?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.856
The girl's got a concussion.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.067
She seems very reliable, sir.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.368
Okay, uh, good work.

24:13.410 --> 24:17.244
Get a formal statement.
Stay with her in case we need an ID.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.790
Okay, we gotta let
the officers on the ground

24:18.832 --> 24:20.413
know we are now looking for a woman,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.620
and we gotta look into Chapman's
known associates.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.956
We have a woman who matches
that description right here, Jerry,

24:25.005 --> 24:26.120
who supposedly can't remember

24:26.173 --> 24:27.834
what her own kid
was wearing this morning

24:27.883 --> 24:30.090
and who was out of our sight
when that accident happened.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.750
That's who we need
to take a run at.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.044
What do you think?

24:34.098 --> 24:35.679
Sam's absolutely right.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.757
All right, let's do it. Let's do it.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.933
If it's a migraine,
you need to take something.

24:42.982 --> 24:47.476
Nash, I'm fine, all right?
l-l've had these before.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.610
Okay, well, look, there's
a pharmacy down the block.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.361
If you tell me what you need,
I can get in the car--

24:51.407 --> 24:53.489
I can't take anything for it.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.195
Why not?

24:55.244 --> 24:56.324
(whispers) Because I'm...

24:58.372 --> 25:01.034
(normal voice) I'm waiting to see
if I'm pregnant, all right?

25:02.292 --> 25:03.702
- Ohh.
- And I can't take anything

25:03.752 --> 25:04.832
until I know for sure.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.618
Acetaminophen.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.209
You can take acetaminophen.
I took it when l was pregnant.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.839
And I bet you anything,
there's some lying around here.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.385
I'm gonna find out for you.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.340
When do you find out?

25:16.390 --> 25:18.301
I mean, it's kind of exciting.
You could be--

25:18.350 --> 25:19.806
Or not.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.263
It's been two weeks.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.475
Two weeks?
You should take a test.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.311
l... I guess ljust...

25:30.237 --> 25:31.522
What if I'm not?

25:32.072 --> 25:33.187
What if you are?

25:46.920 --> 25:49.047
She's got a pregnancy test.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.545
Wanna pee on a stick?

25:50.591 --> 25:51.751
Nash!

25:51.800 --> 25:53.631
All right, all right. I'm just checking.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.765
Here.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.932
Um, oxycodone?

26:09.985 --> 26:11.100
This is weird.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.484
VVhy?

26:12.529 --> 26:14.440
'Cause it's not her name on the bottle.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.990
Megan Renforth?
That's the downstairs tenant.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.870
They searched her place this morning.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.123
At least, they should've.
(beep)

26:26.168 --> 26:28.454
No, yeah, they did.
Tenant wasn't at home,

26:28.504 --> 26:31.587
but mom let them in.
Keys hidden around the meter.

26:31.632 --> 26:32.997
(Traci) So you want us to go in?

26:33.050 --> 26:35.587
Uh, yeah. We can swing it
without a warrant.

26:35.636 --> 26:36.921
Go in. Check it out.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.586
Take a good hard look, okay?
Call me back.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.317
(knock on door)
Megan Renforth, it's the police!

26:55.197 --> 26:56.482
We're coming in!

26:57.825 --> 26:59.190
Megan Renforth?

26:59.243 --> 27:01.199
It's the police.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.038
Oh, my God.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.701
What--What are we looking for?

27:10.754 --> 27:13.370
Uh, kiddie porn,
keys to a red truck,

27:13.423 --> 27:17.211
drugs--anything that ties Megan
to the mom or the kid.

27:17.261 --> 27:20.048
That oxycodone's
pretty serious stuff, huh?

27:20.097 --> 27:21.962
Hillbilly heroin, right?

27:22.015 --> 27:23.221
Easy there, rook.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.178
We didn't just bust
the French Connection.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.932
No way.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.643
| used to have one of these.

27:31.692 --> 27:34.434
You know what? There should be a rule--
no pink electronics.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.647
Gives women a bad name.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.652
Oh, my God.

27:41.702 --> 27:42.782
(sets case down)
Noelle?

27:44.288 --> 27:45.994
What?

27:46.039 --> 27:47.870
This is him, isn't it?

27:47.916 --> 27:50.623
That's the guy we're looking for.
That's Connor Chapman.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.248
That's the guy.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.668
"'Yes, You Can!‘
Releasing the Inner Winner:

27:57.718 --> 27:59.959
The Ways to be Successful in Life."

28:00.012 --> 28:02.924
Every year | reread it cover to cover. You?

28:02.973 --> 28:05.009
Uh, no, not since college.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.434
I needed all the mental motivation

28:06.476 --> 28:08.137
- I could get back then.
- Oh.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.302
You know, guy like me--

28:09.354 --> 28:11.686
not exactly the beefiest guy in the room.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.394
Really? You look fine in this room.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.856
Oh, thank you. |, uh--Thanks.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.112
(beep)
Uh, here it is.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.863
This is the, uh, woman.

28:21.909 --> 28:22.898
That's her.

28:22.951 --> 28:23.940
You sure?

28:23.994 --> 28:25.700
Yeah, that's definitely her.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.361
Outstanding.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.915
(beeping)
So theyjust send you the picture,

28:29.249 --> 28:30.238
and then you call it in,

28:30.292 --> 28:32.704
and then everyone's
all chasing around for her?

28:32.753 --> 28:34.539
Cool job or what?

28:34.588 --> 28:35.577
Yes, it is.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.121
(inhales)

28:38.800 --> 28:40.961
(exhales deeply)

28:42.512 --> 28:44.343
Okay, Epstein, great work.

28:44.389 --> 28:48.052
Sammy, get a copy
of this photograph to everyone.

28:48.101 --> 28:51.559
We are now looking for
Megan Renforth, 34, no priors.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.267
We know she's connected to Chapman,
and her pills connect us to...

28:54.316 --> 28:55.897
- Kathryn Leigh.
- Kathryn Leigh.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.683
Now we just need to know
how it all fits together, eh?

28:57.736 --> 29:00.352
Talk to Callaghan.
Get him to get it out of the mother.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.487
You mean McNally.
She's the one doing the interview.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.905
(woman on radio) Megan Renforth
is now the prime suspect.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.786
Check NBT for furthers.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.822
Female, white, mid-30s. Got it.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.457
All right, we need to go back.
We have to find that cabbie--

29:14.503 --> 29:16.243
you know, the one that was all,
"I'm sorry."

29:16.296 --> 29:17.581
Why? He said he didn't see the girl.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.997
No, he said he didn't see the guy.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.132
He wouldn't even look
at Rebecca's photo.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.338
Gail, not everyone's hiding something.

29:24.388 --> 29:25.594
I don't--

29:25.639 --> 29:28.631
Dispatch, I need you
to track down a cabbie.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.972
It's a Sunstar Company,
Omar Shaheed.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.100
Copy.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.226
Okay.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.140
She's inexperienced, Luke.
She's a rookie.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.230
She's nonthreatening.
She can listen.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.692
Look, she's perfect for this
because she's a rookie.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.653
Okay.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.994
Are you ready for this?

29:52.291 --> 29:53.451
Absolutely.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.535
Yeah?

29:55.752 --> 29:58.334
Okay, fine. Fine.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.377
If it were me,
I'd go at her with the drugs,

30:03.427 --> 30:05.133
the neighbor, the boyfriend,
everything.

30:05.178 --> 30:08.306
She's lying about somethin'.
You know it. Let her know it.

30:08.348 --> 30:11.090
(Luke) There's no right
or wrong way to do this.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.633
Remember, nothing makes
a person feel worse

30:12.686 --> 30:15.177
than having something they need to tell.
Let her tell it.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.178
All right.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.853
(door beeps)

30:27.117 --> 30:29.984
What do you mean, it was Megan?
She's my downstairs tenant.

30:30.037 --> 30:32.699
She was the one driving the truck
right before the accident.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.198
Look, we believe
she's involved with Chapman.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.618
I mean, that's--
that's what we know.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.753
Megan took Rebecca,

30:41.798 --> 30:45.006
and she has a relationship with a pedophile
who owns that truck.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.710
Kathryn, we also know
about the oxycodone

30:48.764 --> 30:50.049
that's in your house.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.140
What we don't know...

30:54.186 --> 30:57.849
What I don't know is, um...

30:59.775 --> 31:01.515
what it all means.

31:01.568 --> 31:07.359
Look, |--| have no idea
what it's been like for you--

31:07.407 --> 31:11.366
you know, the divorce
and being alone,

31:11.411 --> 31:12.617
raising a little girl.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.072
|--| couldn't even begin
to guess how hard it's been.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.411
I really want to find Rebecca.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.671
Is there anything you can do to help me?

31:30.764 --> 31:32.504
I really want to tell you.

31:38.188 --> 31:39.598
(lowers voice) But I don't know.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.605
What do you mean?

31:43.944 --> 31:45.184
I don't know.

31:47.864 --> 31:50.731
lt's been--You gotta understand
it's been a really rough year.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.742
Since Ben and I split,
lj--| haven't been doing very well,

31:53.787 --> 31:56.403
and H mean, I've been--
I've been a bit of a mess,

31:56.456 --> 31:57.741
and I haven't been sleeping,

31:57.791 --> 31:59.622
and Megan, you know,
she's a friend, right?

32:01.503 --> 32:04.666
so she was helping me out
with Rebecca, and...

32:04.714 --> 32:06.420
I mean, she knew
that I wasn't sleeping,

32:06.466 --> 32:09.128
so she gave me those pills.

32:09.177 --> 32:14.763
And then yesterday
it was just a really long day, and...

32:14.808 --> 32:17.766
I guess I took more
than what I usually do.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.561
Rebecca. ..

32:23.775 --> 32:26.437
Rebecca asked me
to read her a bedtime story,

32:26.486 --> 32:28.351
but I couldn't, because...

32:31.116 --> 32:33.528
l was zoned out in front of the TV.

32:33.577 --> 32:34.657
(sniffles)

32:38.582 --> 32:40.163
So I guess...

32:42.335 --> 32:44.246
she put herself to bed.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.834
And she must have got up

32:48.884 --> 32:52.672
and made herself breakfast...

32:54.014 --> 32:56.847
and got herself dressed...

32:57.976 --> 33:00.308
and walked to school by herself...

33:03.190 --> 33:04.805
and the next thing I knew,

33:04.858 --> 33:08.521
the phone was ringing, and it was 9:30,

33:08.570 --> 33:11.812
and l was still zoned out in front of the TV,

33:11.865 --> 33:13.446
and...

33:15.035 --> 33:16.024
it was the school,

33:16.077 --> 33:19.535
and they said that she hadn't made it
and that she was gone.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.322
Why wouldn't you tell us this before?

33:22.375 --> 33:25.082
(sniffles) Because I wanted you
to look for her

33:25.128 --> 33:27.369
the same as you would
if I was a good mother

33:27.422 --> 33:29.128
and not if I was just a mess.

33:30.842 --> 33:34.005
Where would Megan go?
Where would she take her?

33:34.054 --> 33:36.136
I don't know.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.217
I mean... (sniffles)

33:38.266 --> 33:39.426
God.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.681
She talked about some family farm
in Port Hope,

33:43.730 --> 33:45.095
but I don't know. I mean, ljust--

33:45.148 --> 33:47.230
Okay, no, let'sjust--
We can start with that.

33:52.155 --> 33:55.022
Sir, we don't have time for this, okay?
Please just look at the picture.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.406
I can't.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.821
You're right. Let's take him in.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.704
No, wait. Wait.
Why can't you? Look at her!

34:02.749 --> 34:06.241
She's a little kid.
She's scared. She needs help.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.545
What if you had a daughter?

34:07.587 --> 34:08.918
I do have a daughter.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.545
Well, then I'm pretty sure
you'd want someone

34:10.590 --> 34:13.332
to help her if she was lost.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.421
I would, but I can't.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.210
What do you mean you can't?
What are you talking about?

34:18.265 --> 34:20.301
I'm not supposed to be here.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.559
You're not supposed to be here.

34:24.604 --> 34:26.265
You mean in this country?

34:28.942 --> 34:31.729
Please just tell us anything
you know about her.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.440
Anything else,
it's just between us.

34:36.283 --> 34:38.569
Have you seen her?

34:38.618 --> 34:40.233
Yes.

34:40.287 --> 34:41.618
What about her?

34:42.664 --> 34:45.747
They were going to the bus station.
Front and York.

34:45.792 --> 34:46.827
Front and York.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.741
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

34:48.795 --> 34:49.910
I'm so sorry.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.875
(siren wailing)

34:56.094 --> 34:57.709
Sir, we're almost at the bus station.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.468
In fact, I just checked with dispatch.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.015
The Port Hope bus left 15 minutes ago.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.093
They're gonna enter the freeway
at the York Street tunnel.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.258
We're gonna cut 'em off there.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.471
We're on it.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.680
(sirens whooping)

35:31.004 --> 35:31.993
(sirens stop)

35:32.047 --> 35:35.005
(helicopter hovering overhead)

35:42.682 --> 35:45.094
(sirens wailing in distance)

36:01.910 --> 36:03.525
Everybody, just stay in your seats.

36:18.385 --> 36:19.750
Connor Chapman?

36:26.309 --> 36:27.810
Rebecca, it's good to see you.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.097
(nervously) Hi.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.194
Her mother's a total drug addict.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.446
We were just trying to help--

36:41.491 --> 36:42.697
take her to the farm for a bit,
you know?

36:42.742 --> 36:43.731
Do something nice.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.446
By kidnapping her
and taking her away

36:45.495 --> 36:46.860
with a convicted sex offender?

36:46.913 --> 36:49.029
No, no, no. You don't understand.
That was a mistake.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.698
It was all lies.
He doesn't have to hide

36:51.751 --> 36:53.161
- who he is with me.
- Keep your eyes forward.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.577
| get him, okay?
I let him be who he is,

36:55.630 --> 36:56.915
and he said he wasn't gonna hurt her.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.501
- He promised.
- Okay, ma'am.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.415
Connor, tell them your promise!

37:04.931 --> 37:06.592
It's okay.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.929
(Oliver)
That's my car right over there.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.020
Okay. I'm gonna close the door,

37:22.073 --> 37:23.233
- okay, Rebecca?
- Okay.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.693
But I'm gonna come right back, all right?

37:24.743 --> 37:25.778
Thank you.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.653
(sighs deeply)

37:30.707 --> 37:32.698
(woman) Sir, please step this way.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.242
(indistinct conversations)

37:35.295 --> 37:36.330
Sir?

37:39.299 --> 37:40.414
Sir?

37:42.218 --> 37:43.333
It's good. We're good.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.592
(sniffles)

37:47.724 --> 37:49.009
We're good.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.993
(sirens wailing in distance)

38:53.039 --> 38:54.028
(Sam) Tough day.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.117
Yeah.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.372
Want to get a drink?

38:56.417 --> 39:00.660
No, I gotta get home.
Zoe had the girls all day.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.705
I kind of want to, uh, lwant
to say good night to everybody.

39:03.758 --> 39:04.793
All right.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.919
Good work out there, huh?

39:08.972 --> 39:11.634
Yeah. You, too, brother.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.184
(knocks on door)

39:16.229 --> 39:18.015
I come bearing gifts. (chuckles)

39:18.064 --> 39:19.179
Thank you.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.432
- There you go.
- Okay.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.692
Uh, you know,
not that it's any of my business,

39:24.737 --> 39:26.944
but the, uh,
the weed and the asthma,

39:26.990 --> 39:28.981
it's kind of a tricky combination.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.944
I mean, not that I would know or anything.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.404
You checked my record.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.704
Busted.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.533
What do you know about asthma, anyway?

39:40.587 --> 39:43.044
between the book, the asthma
and the high-speed pursuit,

39:43.089 --> 39:44.875
it's like you're me, but a hot chick.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.132
Whoa. That was incredibly
inappropriate. I'm sorry.

39:49.470 --> 39:50.721
So they found the little girl?

39:50.763 --> 39:52.219
She's fine? She's good?

39:52.265 --> 39:54.472
Yeah, safe and sound
thanks to you--

39:54.517 --> 39:56.553
I mean, at least partly.
That was very heroic.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.766
I wouldn't be surprised if they gave you,
like, a citation or something.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.932
So, uh, I was thinking maybe I should

40:03.985 --> 40:05.896
just hang out here for a little
while with you, you know,

40:05.945 --> 40:08.561
to make sure you're okay,
you don't need anything.

40:08.615 --> 40:09.900
My hero.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.485
Ah, it's going around.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.274
(laughs)

40:15.747 --> 40:17.783
(door creaks open, closes)

40:17.832 --> 40:19.038
Noelle?

40:21.294 --> 40:22.409
You okay?

40:22.462 --> 40:23.872
(door squeaks)

40:28.134 --> 40:30.216
How long are you supposed to wait?

40:31.846 --> 40:33.347
I don't know.

40:33.389 --> 40:34.970
Nothing's happening.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.850
We can wait a little longer.

40:42.565 --> 40:45.648
Yeah. We can do that.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.820
Today was amazing, hey?

40:54.869 --> 40:56.029
(ice cubes clink)

40:56.079 --> 40:59.947
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.284
You were great.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.417
(chuckles) Thanks to you.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.495
When did you hang these?

41:07.548 --> 41:09.254
Oh, last night.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.801
(sighs) It took a little pinot noir,

41:10.843 --> 41:12.834
but finally took the plunge.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.255
What's going on with you and Swarek?

41:20.019 --> 41:21.134
What do you mean?

41:21.187 --> 41:23.519
(ice cubes rattle)

41:23.564 --> 41:25.555
Secrets, Andy. They don't work.
They never do.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.564
Yep. I don't want secrets.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.566
Then tell me the truth.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.148
I can't help you unless you
tell me the truth.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.563
Don't do that.
I'm not a suspect, Luke.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.026
Okay, and I'm not blind.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.986
- (sighs) It was one night.
- Okay.

41:39.038 --> 41:40.574
It was one--| didn't even
sleep with him, okay?

41:41.666 --> 41:43.657
Then what did you do?

41:43.710 --> 41:44.790
Nothing.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.291
I'm gonna go.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.548
No. No. Luke, please don't. Okay?

41:52.593 --> 41:54.675
- Don't go.
- Will you stop, please?

41:54.721 --> 41:56.677
One night? | don't--| don't
know what that means.

41:56.723 --> 41:59.339
I don't know what you're saying,
but I do know it is not nothing.

41:59.392 --> 42:00.677
It's not, Andy.

42:01.686 --> 42:04.302
Luke, really, l--Come on.
