00:07.775 --> 00:10.109
<i> Team Gastelum</i>
<i> started the competition</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:14.313

00:22.056 --> 00:24.490

00:26.560 --> 00:27.593
What?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.395
No look in the camera.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.032
The language barrier -- we can't
really communicate that well.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.299
Fight.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.335

00:36.370 --> 00:38.470
<i> Arkansas native Justin Frazier</i>

01:52.913 --> 01:59.251
¶

02:53.340 --> 02:54.740
Been looking forward
to this fight

02:54.775 --> 02:56.975
because Julija was
my first pick.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.277
I've been excited
to see her fight.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.678
I see a lot of fight in her.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.113
I'm very curious
and interested to see

03:01.148 --> 03:03.115
how she comes out
and performs.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.917
I'd say technically,
skill-set-wise,

03:04.952 --> 03:07.586
you're better across the board,
from start to finish.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.555
I just -- I feel like you
can take this fight

03:09.590 --> 03:11.723
wherever you feel comfortable.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.594
I think so, as well.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.830
I think work into a shot,
take her down...

03:18.866 --> 03:20.365
-Yeah.
-...and then you just have

03:20.401 --> 03:23.735
a much, much higher caliber
ground game than she does.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.171
I'm very confident in Julija's
abilities and skill-sets,

03:26.207 --> 03:28.140
but I'm not going
to count out Marciea.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.641
She's athletic,

03:29.677 --> 03:31.210
and she's in this house
for a reason, you know?

03:31.245 --> 03:34.413
It's going to be important for
Julija to push her game plan.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.382
So I just want entry, entry,
shoot, push up against

03:37.418 --> 03:39.384
the fence,
bounce her off, take her down.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.653
Okay.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.560
Good.
Let me show you one thing.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.862
If you can link your hands,
always link your hands.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.497
-Yeah.
-The success rate
goes through the roof,

03:52.533 --> 03:54.032
especially once
you're sweaty, you know?

03:54.068 --> 03:55.467
Plus, this motion,

03:55.502 --> 03:57.603
this type of pulling motion,
is much harder...

03:57.638 --> 03:58.870
-Yeah.
-...than this here.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.372
Try it.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.277
Then, like, pop her in.
Then pull her out.

¶

04:26.634 --> 04:35.173
¶

04:35.209 --> 04:38.677
When I was in college, like,
and I came out, like,

04:38.712 --> 04:41.046
especially because I was --
I played collegiate sports.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.081
I had a full-ride basketball
scholarship, so it was, like,

04:43.117 --> 04:44.816
we traveled
a lot with the guys,

04:44.852 --> 04:47.085
and when I came out,
they treated me different.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.287
They're spitting
in my face.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.821
-Who?
-Are you serious?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.256
-Yeah.
-Who?

04:51.292 --> 04:53.425
This was in the early --
It was, like, 2001, 2002.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.994
-Cut it out.
-Yeah. I swear to God.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.329
Swear to God.
-It's a lot better now.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.830
Oh, yeah.
Much better.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.198
-They're spitting in your face?
-I've been through some [bleep]

05:00.234 --> 05:01.566
Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.835
-Yeah.
-And but -- And
you were in Illinois.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.304
-Right.
-Which is...

05:05.339 --> 05:09.207
Now it's, like, "Oh, my God.
High five," you know?

05:09.243 --> 05:10.976
I came out to my mom.
I said, "Hey, Mom. I'm gay."

05:11.011 --> 05:13.445
She's like, "Hey,
I already knew." [ Laughs ]

05:13.480 --> 05:14.946
And I'm like,
"Okay, that's awesome."

05:14.982 --> 05:17.716
So my family is super
supportive,

05:17.751 --> 05:21.586
but in college,

05:21.622 --> 05:25.457
I think back to those days
that it wasn't so accepting,

05:25.492 --> 05:28.327
and it just makes me cringe
to even think about

05:28.362 --> 05:32.264
when I did come out
and how the people treated me.

05:32.299 --> 05:35.100
It was --
It was not good at all.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.168
This is my girl.

05:36.203 --> 05:40.906
I call her the Queen B,
Miss Britney.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.841
Britney and I -- How long
have we been dating for?

05:42.876 --> 05:45.644
-Three years tomorrow.
-That's right.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.279
[ Laughs ]
-It's our anniversary tomorrow.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.848
Our 3-year anniversary
is on the 4th of July.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.049
When I first met Britney,

05:51.085 --> 05:52.984
she was actually
a client of mine.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.655
I was personal-training her,
and through that relationship,

05:56.690 --> 06:00.459
it just developed
into something a lot stronger

06:00.494 --> 06:02.828
than I had ever anticipated.

06:02.863 --> 06:07.399
Britney is the one who is
the anchor of this relationship.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.334
Say bye.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.936
She holds down the fort.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.471
She's a businesswoman.

06:12.506 --> 06:16.208
We are actually partners in life
and business partners, as well.

06:16.243 --> 06:20.212
Behind me is our
boutique-style fitness studio

06:20.247 --> 06:22.748
exclusively for women
in Schaumburg, Illinois,

06:22.783 --> 06:25.150
which is in the northwest
suburbs of Chicago.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.885
So it's about, give or take,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.020
with traffic 30 minutes
away from the city.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.257
I've been an entrepreneur
for as long as I can remember.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.393
I feel as though
that I'm not meant to work

06:34.428 --> 06:38.930
for anyone other than myself.

06:38.966 --> 06:43.301
I put fighting aside for 2 years
to open up Midwest Performance,

06:43.337 --> 06:46.471
which is now a fitness studio
exclusively for women.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.607
Ladies can go ahead,
put their stuff in there.

06:48.642 --> 06:52.310
Retail shop over here,
plus our consultation session.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.479
After we did get up and going,

06:54.515 --> 06:56.481
I decided to take a step
back from the business

06:56.517 --> 06:58.016
and I delegated
my tasks to Britney

06:58.051 --> 06:59.651
and other team members.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.586
My business coach has said
if I was really serious

07:01.622 --> 07:04.222
about this fighting that I need
to give it 100%,

07:04.258 --> 07:05.924
and I can't do 50/50.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.193
Yeah.
So, like, you're finished here.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.295
Drive in.
Drop it.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.865
I'm now at VFS Academy
in Wood Dale, Illinois,

07:13.901 --> 07:17.068
and I'm training underneath
one of the best striking coaches

07:17.104 --> 07:19.037
in the world,
which is Mike Valle,

07:19.072 --> 07:22.107
who was at Winkeljohn,
Greg Jackson's camp,

07:22.142 --> 07:25.610
for roughly, like, 6 years.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.712
Yes.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.814
Now, now.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.382
Is the pizza good?

07:30.417 --> 07:32.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

07:32.286 --> 07:34.419
Serenity, your pizza good?

07:34.455 --> 07:36.121
Oh, I got a thumbs up.

07:36.156 --> 07:39.558
So here's my sister,
my baby sister, Monique,

07:39.593 --> 07:41.026
and this is her two babies,

07:41.061 --> 07:47.899
and then the little one
is actually sleeping over here.

07:47.935 --> 07:52.904
Mr. Major with his Dada.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.308
Look at that,
not even a week old.

07:56.343 --> 07:59.478
How do you feel
about your daughter fighting?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.279
Now or when she called
and told me

08:01.315 --> 08:04.783
she was coming out of corporate
America to become a fighter,

08:04.818 --> 08:06.051
and if I would have had
dentures,

08:06.086 --> 08:07.118
they would've fell out?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.253
Which time are you
talking about?

08:08.288 --> 08:09.321
Allen: Both.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.122
My mom was shocked,

08:11.158 --> 08:13.058
and she approached me
and asked, you know,

08:13.093 --> 08:14.392
"Are you really sure
about this?"

08:14.428 --> 08:16.795
I'm like, "Mom, I'm sure."

08:16.830 --> 08:18.663
My dad, on the other hand,
he's --

08:18.699 --> 08:21.466
I think he's just --
He's open-minded.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.536
This is how competitive
we are -- $5 a game.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.304
He put in his five.
I put in my five.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.273
So we're going to --
-She's going to lose it.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.741
No.
I always win.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.410
There's a difference
between a need and a want,

08:32.446 --> 08:36.948
and some of these people
coming in here, they need this.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.751
I see need as a sense
of scarcity and urgency.

08:39.786 --> 08:42.020
They have nothing else
to fall back on.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.522
That sometimes can get you
in trouble,

08:43.557 --> 08:45.790
and you can have
a tendency to fail.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.993
But me, this is a want.
I'm ready.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.594
I deserve to be here,

08:49.663 --> 08:51.663
and these chicks
don't know what they're in for.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.964
[Bleep] is about to get real.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.300
He's in trouble now.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.139
-Oh.
-Yay!

09:01.174 --> 09:03.542
So close.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.244
I thought it'd be nice just to
change the setting a little bit.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.080
I'm sure you guys are getting a
bit of cabin fever in the house.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.916
We'll play some games,
have some races.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.551
Go!

09:22.029 --> 09:23.995
I'm going to
introduce you guys.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.664
Your guest coaches for today --

09:25.699 --> 09:27.866
These guys have been with me
since I was like this,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.134
you know,
and they're still with me.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.435
Chance goes to all my fights.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.771
Brian has been to a few
of my fights, as well.

09:32.806 --> 09:36.174
These guys have over
30 years of MMA experience.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.710
Please welcome them
as part of the family

09:38.745 --> 09:40.245
because they are part of,
like, my family.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.113
So let's welcome them.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.115
Man: Whoo!

09:44.151 --> 09:47.752
The first MMA gym that I ever
went to was Chance's gym.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.254
I really like having him around.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.123
He's been, actually,
like a father figure.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.192
It's been a long road
with Brian, as well.

09:54.227 --> 09:57.796
The first jiu-jitsu class that
I ever took was Brian's class,

09:57.831 --> 10:00.231
and he taught at Chance's gym.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.569
Beaumont: Grab the toes.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.504
You got to be able to control.

10:06.540 --> 10:10.141
We started working with thing
young man 10 years ago.

10:10.177 --> 10:14.713
In the beginning, it wasn't
too hard to trick him.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.616
As soon as that happened,
he went up a level.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.050
10 years later,

10:19.086 --> 10:22.354
do you have any idea
how hard it is to trick him,

10:22.389 --> 10:25.490
what it takes to catch him with
something he doesn't expect?

10:25.525 --> 10:27.058
I mean, I'd have to
do something that

10:27.094 --> 10:28.893
he's really not looking for.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.729
-What?
-Oh.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.031
[ Applause ]
[ Laughs ] What?

10:33.066 --> 10:35.166
No.
-Stand up.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.969
[ Laughs ] What?

10:39.539 --> 10:42.807
Kelvin started as a white belt
training with us.

10:42.843 --> 10:46.645
For me to be able to give him
his black belt tonight at,

10:46.680 --> 10:49.814
kind of, the pinnacle
of his career,

10:49.850 --> 10:53.752
almost as a recognition
of everything that he's done

10:53.787 --> 10:55.186
and everything
that he's been through,

10:55.222 --> 10:56.588
and to be able to
share that with him,

10:56.623 --> 10:58.757
I can't tell you
what the feeling was like.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.858
Thank you.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.027
Crazy, crazy road.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.697
I mean, I don't even know
what to say.

11:05.732 --> 11:06.998
[ Laughs ]

11:07.034 --> 11:08.333
It's insane, you know?

11:08.368 --> 11:12.437
Well, remember, the littlest kid
picked dead last

11:12.472 --> 11:14.539
from a nowhere town
in the middle of Arizona...

11:14.574 --> 11:16.041
Oh, yeah.

11:16.109 --> 11:20.412
...not only has he beaten all
the odds coming from down here,

11:20.447 --> 11:25.183

in general at home.

It's possible.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.557

26:01.827 --> 26:03.294

26:03.329 --> 26:06.430
I've hit mitts maybe twice
for a few minutes each,

26:06.465 --> 26:07.731
and that's about it,

26:07.767 --> 26:10.901

a lot more.

more one-on-one attention

26:13.239 --> 26:16.407
with each coach, especially
leading up to a fight,

26:16.442 --> 26:19.410

gotten that from Team Whittaker.

It's nothing against
Team Whittaker or anyone at all.

mesh better than others,

we will be both equal,

I'm more skilled fighter.

that they see Julija

27:24.310 --> 27:27.611
I know Marciea is a striker

because I almost fought her

27:29.181 --> 27:30.280
about a year ago.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.116
She's more of a point fighter.

Julija, she's got
a karate background,

27:34.887 --> 27:36.854

a good back-and-forth

it. Tap out due to armbar.

Whittaker:
So with Julija winning,

40:18.283 --> 40:20.250
it's definitely
a morale boost for our team.

40:20.285 --> 40:23.620
No one likes to have, you know,
consecutive losses,

40:23.655 --> 40:25.355
but that's just part
of the sport, you know?

40:25.390 --> 40:27.357
Somebody has got to win.
Somebody has got to lose.

40:27.392 --> 40:28.491
They're going out there
and they're giving

40:28.527 --> 40:30.193
absolutely everything they have.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.661
I'm proud of all my athletes.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.229
A win is a win.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.269
[Bleep] So...

40:39.304 --> 40:41.905
You pulled guard.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.107
You pulled guard
in an MMA fight.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.909
[Bleep] me.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.648
Yeah.

40:55.187 --> 40:57.520
You did great.
You really did.

41:00.358 --> 41:01.591
I am very surprised
that after hitting Julija

41:04.930 --> 41:06.362
with a lot of blows
to the head

41:06.398 --> 41:10.033
that she still had the willpower

41:10.068 --> 41:12.435
to get up and fight back.

41:12.471 --> 41:15.138
-Be right back.
-[Bleep] my arm.

41:15.173 --> 41:18.708
-We have to do the interview.
-I can't believe it.

41:18.743 --> 41:20.810
Gastelum: Ibuprofen and some
ice, you're going to be fine.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.545
I knew it right away,
as soon as she got it.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.013
I tried so hard.
-Mm-hmm.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.115
-I tried so hard.
-That's it.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.185
We knew what her game plan
was from start to finish,

41:29.221 --> 41:30.687
and that was to take me down.

41:30.722 --> 41:34.290
We drilled well over
300 different armbar defenses,

41:34.326 --> 41:36.192
and to be perfectly
honest with you,

41:36.228 --> 41:38.761
if I were to do anything
all over again, I wouldn't.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.264
I just got caught, and that's
the name of the game.

All right, guys,
for my heavyweight pick,

42:01.853 --> 42:04.687
fighting out of Team Gastelum
will be Josh.

we find Michel.

¶

42:23.441 --> 42:25.375
We picked Josh versus Michel

42:25.410 --> 42:27.176
because we feel
it's the best matchup for them.

42:27.212 --> 42:29.312
I feel like he's one of the most
well-rounded guys

42:29.347 --> 42:31.814
in the tournament.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.817
Michel, when it comes to
wrestling, he's Olympic-level,

42:34.853 --> 42:39.122
but not everything transfers
over to MMA from wrestling,

42:39.157 --> 42:40.924
so I feel he's going
to have a problem

42:40.959 --> 42:44.661
with the MMA style
that Josh brings.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.564
Whittaker: I think Michel's key
to success in this next fight

42:47.599 --> 42:49.666
is going to be for him
to implement is wrestling game.

42:49.701 --> 42:51.367
He's got very high-caliber
wrestling.

42:51.403 --> 42:54.704
Taking down Josh and
controlling him on the ground

42:54.739 --> 42:56.372
and out-wrestling him
for the 10 minutes

42:56.408 --> 42:57.974
is going to be
very key to winning.
