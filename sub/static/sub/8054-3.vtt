WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.127
Good morning.
Couple announcements.

00:03.295 --> 00:06.124
As we all know, Ron is recovering
from his hernia surgery,

00:06.249 --> 00:08.164
so I got him flowers from all of us.

00:08.289 --> 00:10.018
So everybody needs to pitch in $90.

00:10.143 --> 00:11.330
$90?

00:12.346 --> 00:15.943
Because I ordered
a beautiful bouquet of daffodils

00:16.411 --> 00:19.185
from a website
after a few glasses of wine.

00:19.817 --> 00:22.523
So, Tom, I think you might be
getting some daffodils too.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.437
Donna,
you're definitely getting some.

00:24.562 --> 00:27.193
Jerry, I don't know, I'm not sure.
Time will tell.

00:28.076 --> 00:29.599
Also, I'm leaving early tonight

00:29.724 --> 00:32.791
because I am a judge
in the Miss Pawnee beauty pageant.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.992
You get to be a judge?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.662
Yes, and it's a responsibility
I take very seriously.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.038
I want to be a judge.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.103
I can't believe
you like beauty pageants.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.996
Whoever Miss Pawnee is,

00:43.121 --> 00:45.461
is gonna be the representative
of womanhood in our town.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.868
And let me assure you
that this year's

00:47.993 --> 00:50.622
Miss Pawnee will be chosen
for her talent and poise.

00:50.747 --> 00:53.008
The girls from Talent and Poise
are gonna be there?

00:53.133 --> 00:54.773
- What?
- Talent and Poise.

00:54.898 --> 00:56.799
It's a strip club
by the V.A. Hospital.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.266
- I have some meetings there.
- That's disgusting.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.977
No, what's disgusting
is the Glitter Factory.

01:02.102 --> 01:04.021
Do not go to the Glitter Factory.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.893 --> 01:42.984
So I was just at the grind,
and I thought you might want

01:43.109 --> 01:46.063
an iced mocha with extra,
extra whipped cream.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.905
Oh, my.
Thank you so much, April.

01:49.533 --> 01:50.694
You're welcome.

01:50.819 --> 01:51.944
By the way,

01:52.379 --> 01:53.833
completely unrelated,

01:53.958 --> 01:57.116
I just signed up
for the Miss Pawnee beauty pageant.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.617
That's wonderful.

01:58.982 --> 02:01.513
That is why I decided
to become a judge.

02:01.863 --> 02:03.609
So that awesome girls like you,

02:03.734 --> 02:05.916
who are not, you know,
classically hot,

02:06.084 --> 02:08.836
can be rewarded
for their intelligence and savvy.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.005
Beauty pageants are idiotic,

02:11.173 --> 02:13.719
but I found that the winner
of the Miss Pawnee pageant

02:13.844 --> 02:15.301
gets $600.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.538
I can be idiotic for $600.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.300
So are you gonna vote
for me, sister?

02:20.523 --> 02:23.408
April, it's unethical for me
to show you favoritism.

02:23.922 --> 02:25.352
You and I are like family.

02:26.884 --> 02:29.315
- The coffee's $7.
- Yes, right, of course.

02:29.955 --> 02:33.180
Just bump that clown. Tell him
they already have an Asian judge.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.939
Awesome.
Thank you so much.

02:36.064 --> 02:38.258
I owe you.
A'ight, peace.

02:38.743 --> 02:41.619
Guess who's also gonna be
a judge in the beauty pageant.

02:41.879 --> 02:44.038
- What? How?
- I know a guy.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.831
I had to call in a few favors.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.226
But if you don't do it
to look at women in bikinis

02:48.351 --> 02:51.545
and assign them numerical grades,
what the hell do you call in favors for?

02:56.483 --> 02:58.218
What you doing in these parts?

02:58.459 --> 03:01.388
I just... I came by
to see the murals.

03:01.842 --> 03:03.328
This one's pretty amazing.

03:03.677 --> 03:05.017
Yeah, this one's a beauty.

03:05.442 --> 03:07.686
In the 1880s, there were a few years

03:07.854 --> 03:10.021
that were pretty rough
and tumble in Pawnee.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.194
This depicts kind of a famous fight

03:12.319 --> 03:16.185
between reverend Bradley
and Anna Beth Stevenson,

03:16.676 --> 03:18.030
a widowed mother of seven.

03:18.451 --> 03:21.367
The original title of this
was "a lively fisting".

03:22.575 --> 03:25.204
But they had to change it.
For obvious reasons.

03:25.485 --> 03:27.441
She's got him
by the hair pretty good there.

03:28.052 --> 03:29.431
Leslie's really cool.

03:29.556 --> 03:30.898
And she's smart.

03:32.093 --> 03:33.212
It's intimidating.

03:34.277 --> 03:37.200
To tell you the truth, I didn't
come here to look at the murals.

03:37.325 --> 03:39.043
I came to ask her on a date.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.475
I really...
I really like you.

03:47.315 --> 03:48.894
And I was wondering

03:49.062 --> 03:51.814
if you maybe want to get
a cup of coffee some time.

03:52.672 --> 03:53.902
Okay. Yeah, sure.

03:54.941 --> 03:56.193
Yeah, absolutely.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.101
Let me check my schedule.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.146
Let's see...

04:01.589 --> 04:03.325
Is that your grandma?

04:10.255 --> 04:11.542
It's Madeleine Albright.

04:12.045 --> 04:13.269
That's her name?

04:14.026 --> 04:15.295
I call mine nana.

04:15.599 --> 04:17.423
No, that's Madeleine Albright.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.789
First female Secretary of State.

04:22.031 --> 04:24.232
OK, so not...
That's not your grandma then.

04:24.357 --> 04:25.695
All right.
I got it.

04:27.186 --> 04:29.732
- How's that schedule looking?
- Good. A couple days are free.

04:29.857 --> 04:31.186
Maybe we could just...

04:31.354 --> 04:34.415
- Lock it in later? Talk later about it?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

04:38.063 --> 04:38.944
Ladies.

04:43.426 --> 04:44.798
Wanna hear something awful?

04:45.288 --> 04:47.119
He didn't even know
Madeleine Albright.

04:47.675 --> 04:49.201
- Who?
- Not you too.

04:49.326 --> 04:51.290
Madeleine Albright,
1st female Secretary of State.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.624
No, who didn't know?

04:53.342 --> 04:55.571
Dave, that cop that I met.

04:56.284 --> 04:59.506
I just don't know if I can date
someone who doesn't share my interests.

05:00.180 --> 05:03.135
I mean, could you date
someone who doesn't

05:03.536 --> 05:05.220
love giving vaccinations?

05:05.567 --> 05:08.223
I've never dated anyone
who loves giving vaccinations.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.428
Weird question for you.
Are you handy?

05:15.553 --> 05:17.191
Like, can you fix things?

05:17.359 --> 05:19.132
- What's broken?
- My shower.

05:19.257 --> 05:22.357
It's leaky, low pressure,
just all around terrible.

05:23.045 --> 05:24.990
Easy.
You want me to come over after work?

05:26.474 --> 05:27.492
Yes, amazing.

05:27.846 --> 05:29.988
I will cook you
a cheap, quick dinner

05:30.113 --> 05:32.372
- that will be no trouble at all for me.
- Great.

05:32.679 --> 05:35.626
Well, I'll see you tonight
for the weirdest second date ever.

05:35.794 --> 05:36.794
Okay.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.587
Hello, fellow judges.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.150
I'm judge Leslie Knope,
and this is my colleague,

05:42.275 --> 05:44.051
Tom Haverford,
who's gonna be a judge.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.910
Hi, Jessica Wicks, miss Pawnee 1994.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.652
I recognized you right away.

05:48.777 --> 05:52.559
And may I say that you look
more beautiful now than when you won.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.561
I like you.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.980
Ray Holstead, Ray's Sandwich Place.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.816
Yes, of course, Ray.
How do you do?

05:58.941 --> 06:00.103
I'm Charles Woliner.

06:00.228 --> 06:03.411
I've judged every Miss Pawnee pageant
for the last 30 years.

06:03.703 --> 06:05.271
I made Jessica.

06:06.035 --> 06:08.718
Well, Tom and I
are very happy to be here.

06:08.843 --> 06:10.827
And I'm sure,
between the five of us,

06:10.996 --> 06:14.414
we will choose the most well-rounded,
intelligent, modern,

06:14.583 --> 06:17.376
and forward-thinking woman
to represent our fine town.

06:18.017 --> 06:19.017
Right, Tom?

06:19.583 --> 06:21.171
You don't believe me?
Watch.

06:21.887 --> 06:23.956
34c, 36b,

06:24.274 --> 06:26.051
34b, 34d.

06:26.852 --> 06:28.720
32a?
How'd you get in here?

06:29.596 --> 06:30.597
I'm kidding.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.016
You're perfect, each one of you.
God bless.

06:34.454 --> 06:37.653
Here they are,
your candidates for Miss Pawnee.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.030
Let's meet the girls.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.719
First up,
please welcome April Ludgate.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.251
Hello, I'm April Ludgate.

07:02.008 --> 07:03.755
I'm 20 years old,

07:04.493 --> 07:05.340
I like...

07:07.036 --> 07:08.036
People...

07:08.561 --> 07:09.561
Places...

07:10.675 --> 07:11.725
And things.

07:12.317 --> 07:15.434
And Pawnee
is my favorite place in the world.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.272
Next up,
please welcome Susan Gleever.

07:21.712 --> 07:23.399
Hi, everyone, I'm Susan.

07:23.939 --> 07:26.400
I'm a history major
at Indiana state,

07:26.719 --> 07:28.279
I play classical piano,

07:28.595 --> 07:29.780
and I volunteer

07:30.023 --> 07:31.657
at the children's hospital.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.750
- She's good.
- Next,

07:37.290 --> 07:38.410
Trish Ianetta.

07:43.681 --> 07:44.681
Hi, y'all.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.046
I'm Trish.

07:46.436 --> 07:47.685
I'm 22 years old.

07:47.810 --> 07:49.360
I've been on <i>Youtube</i>.

07:49.581 --> 07:51.790
I just love to hang out
with my friends.

07:51.915 --> 07:53.012
I love to laugh.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.048
I love the summertime

07:55.173 --> 07:56.766
and going to the beach,

07:57.310 --> 07:59.354
and I love wearing bikinis
at the beach

07:59.479 --> 08:00.811
with everyone there.

08:01.765 --> 08:03.980
They can't all be winners.

08:04.105 --> 08:05.932
Are y'all having a good time?

08:12.408 --> 08:14.450
Looks like we got a frontrunner.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.831
And now it's time
for our ever-popular talent competition

08:21.339 --> 08:23.288
where our ladies
will each demonstrate

08:23.413 --> 08:24.919
their excellent skills.

08:25.437 --> 08:27.885
Here we have,
Leslie's custom score card

08:28.283 --> 08:30.176
with categories such as

08:30.503 --> 08:31.581
presentation,

08:31.706 --> 08:32.804
intelligence,

08:32.929 --> 08:34.530
knowledge of "herstory,"

08:34.876 --> 08:36.275
fruitful gestures,

08:36.504 --> 08:37.719
<i>je ne sais quol,</i>

08:37.980 --> 08:39.400
and something called

08:39.525 --> 08:41.438
the Naomi Wolf Factor.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.157
And our first one up
is Trish Ianetta,

08:44.282 --> 08:45.814
whose talent is baton.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.345
My girl Trish is talented.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.470
She's not even twirling the baton.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.960
I'm going to do impressions.

09:06.433 --> 09:07.750
Celebrity impressions.

09:07.875 --> 09:09.506
That's wild, wild stuff.

09:14.328 --> 09:16.578
This is an impression of my sister.

09:18.259 --> 09:19.456
Hi, I'm Natalie.

09:19.581 --> 09:21.878
I love Ritalin
and have low self-esteem.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.361
This is an impression of my boss,
Leslie Knope.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.607
Women should do everything.
Check out my four-color pen.

09:36.732 --> 09:39.444
Listen up while I talk
about some really important stuff.

09:39.569 --> 09:41.606
Parks, parks...
Michelle Obama, parks.

09:41.731 --> 09:43.516
Gay penguins, parks, sugar, parks.

09:44.574 --> 09:46.531
She got me.
She got me good.

10:08.556 --> 10:11.151
I'm texting Trish
to tell her how good she did earlier.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.749
Susan isn't a perfect 10.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.698
But, in my mind,
Susan is the perfect Miss Pawnee.

10:17.994 --> 10:19.490
Her values are strong.

10:19.615 --> 10:22.001
Her commitment to her job
is very admirable.

10:22.126 --> 10:23.926
She has a real sense of...

10:26.791 --> 10:27.666
Over here.

10:30.763 --> 10:31.879
How's it going?

10:33.138 --> 10:36.092
I hooked your toilet up to your shower.
That's what you wanted?

10:37.133 --> 10:38.293
Excellent.

10:47.053 --> 10:48.203
Is that Andy?

10:58.454 --> 11:01.325
I know you're in there
'cause I can see you through the screen.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.168
What's up?
What are you doing?

11:12.834 --> 11:14.171
Do you live down here?

11:15.291 --> 11:16.119
What?

11:20.541 --> 11:21.428
My God.

11:22.051 --> 11:23.222
You live down here.

11:24.045 --> 11:26.316
I can't believe this is happening.
What?

11:26.441 --> 11:28.810
I can't be at my house
and see my ex-boyfriend

11:29.148 --> 11:32.235
living in a hole
in my backyard like a gopher.

11:32.514 --> 11:34.056
That's so weird.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.735
I have been trying really hard
not to bother you.

11:37.586 --> 11:38.957
When you had that barbecue,

11:39.082 --> 11:41.698
I didn't come up,
even though it smelled so good.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.538
You've been here a whole week?

11:45.123 --> 11:46.588
One week only.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.520
I guess that's the office
that you were telling me about

11:51.645 --> 11:54.169
- that you go to every day.
- Listen.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.880
Are we gonna talk about anything
other than the lies?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.287
I can't do this now.

11:58.412 --> 12:00.176
I've a guy fixing my bathroom.

12:00.301 --> 12:01.401
I got to go.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.555
I got to zoom out too.
'cause I have some people coming over,

12:04.724 --> 12:07.018
so why don't you call first,
next time?

12:07.397 --> 12:08.707
You know the way out.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.956
It's time now for the dreaded q&a.

12:13.355 --> 12:15.942
And the first question goes
to Tom Haverford.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.734
I have one for the hot one.

12:19.441 --> 12:22.441
First off, I just want to say
I'm a little bit surprised

12:22.809 --> 12:24.866
because I didn't think
angels could fly so low.

12:27.305 --> 12:30.243
You truly are a beautiful woman.

12:31.795 --> 12:32.916
You're so funny.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.435
You're funny.

12:36.372 --> 12:37.629
Do you have a question?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.798
I actually have a real question.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.136
If you don't mind.

12:42.415 --> 12:45.444
Alexis De Tocqueville
called America the great experiment.

12:45.835 --> 12:48.859
What can we do as citizens
to improve on that experiment?

12:52.216 --> 12:54.243
I think that America

12:54.817 --> 12:57.056
is the land of the free,

12:57.536 --> 12:59.402
which is a wonderful thing.

12:59.908 --> 13:01.499
And also the brave,

13:01.624 --> 13:03.224
where people can live.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.875
And no one
can ever take that away from you.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.714
And it never gives up.

13:09.341 --> 13:12.832
But the high birthing rate of immigrants
frightens me.

13:13.263 --> 13:14.916
No offense to anyone out there,

13:15.085 --> 13:17.670
but if it were
up to me and my family,

13:18.075 --> 13:21.257
I would actually call it our America
and not their America.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.094
Don't applaud that.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.513
Don't.
She didn't answer my question.

13:29.829 --> 13:31.308
You don't think it's weird

13:31.477 --> 13:35.004
that my ex-boyfriend lives in a tent
in the pit outside my house?

13:35.627 --> 13:36.634
It's not...

13:37.279 --> 13:38.099
Ideal.

13:39.548 --> 13:41.552
Maybe you should try to relax,
maybe...

13:41.857 --> 13:44.155
Take one atavin
I saw in the medicine cabinet.

13:44.802 --> 13:45.511
Dude.

13:45.636 --> 13:47.699
I peeked.
I also didn't see any toothpaste.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.911
- Do you not use toothpaste?
- I always knew he was lazy,

13:51.080 --> 13:53.866
but this is like a new low for him.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.335
We should invite him inside.

13:57.887 --> 13:59.987
Have you not been listening
to anything?

14:00.112 --> 14:02.297
I don't know.
It's raining outside.

14:02.587 --> 14:04.675
And he's living in a pit.

14:08.306 --> 14:12.016
Folks, just a couple more contestants,
and then the judges will decide

14:12.184 --> 14:13.382
our next Miss Pawnee,

14:13.507 --> 14:16.285
a winner of $600
in gift certificates

14:16.410 --> 14:19.649
to Big Archie's Sporting Goods
and Emerson Fencing Company.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.763
What? We don't get cash?
This is for a fence?

14:22.945 --> 14:26.155
It won't cover a whole fence,
but it'll defray the cost considerably.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.548
Oh, my God.

14:29.856 --> 14:30.743
I quit.

14:31.505 --> 14:32.370
I quit.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.738
Okay.
I guess she really is quitting.

14:37.905 --> 14:39.001
No, I didn't win.

14:39.675 --> 14:42.839
But at least I didn't make
any new friendships.

14:43.348 --> 14:45.801
So how long do we have
to pretend to deliberate

14:45.926 --> 14:47.725
till we get back out there?

14:50.084 --> 14:52.372
- What do you mean?
- We're all in agreement.

14:52.790 --> 14:55.587
- The hot one, by a landslide.
- Well, her name is Trish,

14:55.983 --> 14:57.833
and I don't think
we should rush this.

14:57.958 --> 15:01.639
What is there to talk about?
I thought Trish was just adorable.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.697
- Take Susan, for example. I think...
- Susan "boring stories"?

15:05.864 --> 15:08.214
It's Trish.
Let's go back out there.

15:09.091 --> 15:10.366
Okay, hold on, everyone.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.616
Hold on.
Everyone, wait, wait.

15:13.419 --> 15:16.156
Look, whoever we choose
is gonna represent

15:16.281 --> 15:18.174
the ideal woman for a year.

15:18.341 --> 15:21.877
She'll be someone that little girls
in south-central Indiana look up to.

15:22.131 --> 15:25.339
Now nobody leaves this room
until we discuss all of it, okay?

15:25.955 --> 15:27.908
Consider yourselves sequestered.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.822
I'm a judge,
so I don't want to sound partial,

15:31.224 --> 15:34.088
but Trish will win this pageant
over my dead body.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.936
Look, I'm the only one here

15:39.377 --> 15:42.189
who has entered and won this contest
in the past.

15:42.928 --> 15:44.734
And I think Trish is a no-brainer.

15:44.998 --> 15:47.069
Jessica, may I ask,
what was your talent?

15:47.237 --> 15:48.728
I packed a suitcase.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.699
I have to say,
Leslie does make a good point.

15:52.032 --> 15:54.241
Trish is not the brightest bulb
in the bunch.

15:54.408 --> 15:57.538
Ray, good. I like what you're saying.
Let's keep talking.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.993
Just stand over there,
and don't drip on anything.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.217
Is Mark the guy
who's fixing your shower?

16:10.879 --> 16:13.773
I don't know about you, Mark,
but I've seen a ton of porn,

16:13.898 --> 16:16.307
and I know what fixing
your shower means.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.324
Sorry, you are on a date.
That's cool.

16:19.618 --> 16:20.901
No, it's all right.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.813
Don't let me interrupt your date.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.547
- Dig in.
- I already ate. I'm super full.

16:25.672 --> 16:27.672
I don't...
I didn't want any.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.703
Okay, so it's still 3-2 for Trish.

16:32.030 --> 16:33.859
Guys, all I ask

16:34.396 --> 16:36.362
is that you look into your hearts

16:36.529 --> 16:38.996
and think, really think,
about what you've seen

16:40.540 --> 16:41.957
and ask yourselves,

16:42.125 --> 16:44.293
who is the most impressive woman
here tonight?

16:46.296 --> 16:48.514
It's the hot one, Trish ianetta.

17:00.491 --> 17:02.314
These are amazing.
Do you...

17:02.439 --> 17:04.694
Do you put a lot of hot sauce
on these or something?

17:04.861 --> 17:07.001
A good chef never reveals
her secrets.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.233
It's hot sauce.

17:10.924 --> 17:13.185
Ann is an extraordinary cook.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.527
Memories.

17:18.281 --> 17:20.272
Do you want some more?
Are you hungry still?

17:20.397 --> 17:21.645
You know what's funny?

17:21.770 --> 17:24.291
I was sitting over here on the couch,
and I was thinking

17:24.416 --> 17:26.502
that there was once a time
when Mark used to be

17:26.670 --> 17:28.127
the stranger in the house.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.547
And now it's me.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.400
Excuse me, everyone.

17:37.697 --> 17:40.303
Why don't we take a moment
to give a round of applause

17:40.428 --> 17:42.544
to all the contestants this evening?

17:44.181 --> 17:45.563
Especially Susan.

17:47.041 --> 17:51.045
This isn't the first time that
Susans have lost to Trishes.

17:51.972 --> 17:53.553
And it won't be the last.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.379
Susan and I will continue on

17:56.651 --> 18:00.655
until the women of Pawnee are judged
not by the flatness of their tummies,

18:01.214 --> 18:03.831
but by the contents of their brains.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.387
And, Trish,

18:07.696 --> 18:09.295
I may not have voted for you,

18:09.546 --> 18:11.212
but now is a time

18:11.337 --> 18:12.893
for us to come together.

18:13.650 --> 18:16.300
I hope you honor
this crown with dignity

18:16.470 --> 18:17.826
and a devotion to...

18:19.367 --> 18:21.480
One, two, three.

18:27.404 --> 18:29.398
As usual, Ann, delicious meal.

18:30.421 --> 18:33.027
Are we doing anything in the way
of dessert or coffee?

18:33.530 --> 18:34.780
We are leaving.

18:36.025 --> 18:37.275
Okay, I get it.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.648
Don't worry. I'm very good
at picking up signals.

18:42.577 --> 18:45.331
- Let's go, Mark.
- No, dummy, just you.

18:45.697 --> 18:46.415
Okay.

18:46.758 --> 18:47.758
All right.

18:49.787 --> 18:51.170
Take care of yourself.

18:53.308 --> 18:55.564
Just don't worry about me, Ann.
Okay?

18:57.409 --> 18:58.420
I'll be fine.

19:02.098 --> 19:05.123
That went really well!

19:06.039 --> 19:07.185
We had dinner,

19:07.352 --> 19:08.911
I got to see her.

19:09.036 --> 19:11.281
Oh, God, I was so tempted
to look back at her.

19:11.406 --> 19:12.706
Was she looking?

19:13.059 --> 19:14.589
I had to walk so slow.

19:16.586 --> 19:18.015
A good day.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.596
Well, well, look who's here.

19:22.763 --> 19:24.158
It's officer John McClane.

19:24.325 --> 19:26.080
Welcome to the party, pal.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.121
- Who's that?
- <I>Die hard.</I>

19:28.709 --> 19:31.085
- Battery?
- Hey, what are you doing here?

19:31.252 --> 19:34.171
The other day I asked you
if you wanted to have coffee?

19:34.724 --> 19:35.706
You said yes.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.462
And then afterwards,
I saw you again,

19:39.341 --> 19:41.274
you acted like
you didn't want to anymore.

19:41.399 --> 19:43.013
We left it kind of open-ended.

19:43.181 --> 19:45.290
- And that's made me uncomfortable.
- OK.

19:45.415 --> 19:48.628
So I thought I'd come in and ask you.
Just get some clearance on this.

19:48.753 --> 19:50.771
- Dave, I like you.
- I like you too.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.898
Okay, so, we'll get coffee then.

19:53.152 --> 19:54.552
But I'm just busy.

19:55.198 --> 19:57.041
Right now, my schedule's just so...

19:58.839 --> 20:00.311
Okay.
Okay, I get it.

20:00.865 --> 20:02.969
Look, I'm not a guy who plays games.

20:03.136 --> 20:06.157
Okay, I just came to tell you
that I like you, and I like coffee,

20:06.604 --> 20:08.546
and if you want to get
some coffee, just...

20:08.754 --> 20:09.998
Here's my number.

20:12.050 --> 20:13.433
Coming through, buddy.

20:22.426 --> 20:23.804
I got your message.

20:25.116 --> 20:26.330
Thanks for coming.

20:26.455 --> 20:28.517
Look, I'd love to go out with you.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.579
- How about Friday for dinner?
- Yeah? Great.

20:32.590 --> 20:36.556
Will Sandra Day
O'Connor and Michelle Obama

20:37.022 --> 20:39.572
and Condoleezza Rice
and Nancy Pelosi...

20:40.701 --> 20:42.054
Are they gonna join us?

20:42.573 --> 20:43.948
No, they won't.

20:44.073 --> 20:47.273
Good, 'cause I don't happen to agree
with Miss Pelosi's views

20:47.398 --> 20:50.581
about the troubled assets relief
program.

20:52.183 --> 20:54.924
- I looked that up to impress you.
- I figured.

20:58.089 --> 21:00.465
Use my grill, let me do you a favor.

21:00.633 --> 21:03.547
Take a key, just come by,
grill up whatever you want.

21:03.752 --> 21:05.637
This is one of my favorite
pick-up strategies.

21:05.805 --> 21:07.510
I'm constantly giving women my keys.

21:07.635 --> 21:10.100
- This is your house key?
- I just happen to have a spare.

21:10.268 --> 21:11.532
Come by whenever you want.

21:11.796 --> 21:13.437
So far, none of 'em have shown up.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.815
That's a very appealing offer.
Thank you.

21:17.232 --> 21:18.233
Matter of time.

21:18.660 --> 21:19.660
Hey, Craig.

21:21.219 --> 21:23.739
- 50 more copies, please.
- You got it.

21:24.842 --> 21:26.283
I have been robbed twice.
