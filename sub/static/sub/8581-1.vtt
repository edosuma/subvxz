(WHIMPERING)

58:50.350 --> 58:52.114
Hello again, Anna.

58:53.510 --> 58:55.717
Help, somebody!

58:55.870 --> 58:57.360
They can't hear you.

58:57.510 --> 58:58.796
Not that it would matter.

58:58.950 --> 59:00.315
They're all aware of you being here.

59:00.470 --> 59:03.076
What I said about calling
the police was true. I did.

59:03.230 --> 59:05.232
I know.

59:05.390 --> 59:08.792
It was your abbreviated 9-1-1 call
that alerted us.

59:08.950 --> 59:12.238
That and your little excursion
downstairs to see Sam.

59:15.350 --> 59:18.479
All outgoing calls
come through our system.

59:18.630 --> 59:21.759
Without yours, we would've assumed
that the doctor's work with Sam

59:21.910 --> 59:23.275
was proceeding as planned.

59:23.430 --> 59:26.320
So I owe you my gratitude.

59:26.470 --> 59:30.077
Without you, we would never
have gotten our dear Lucie back.

59:31.230 --> 59:32.675
I didn't give her to you.

59:32.870 --> 59:34.440
Of course you did.

59:34.590 --> 59:36.911
What do you want with her?

59:37.910 --> 59:40.390
Her gift, of course.

59:40.550 --> 59:43.394
It's what kept her alive
during the doctor's work

59:43.590 --> 59:45.433
when she was a child.

59:45.630 --> 59:47.234
It's what gave her the strength

59:47.390 --> 59:50.837
to spend all those years
trying to find him.

59:55.590 --> 59:58.321
Lucie is very different, of course.

59:59.750 --> 01:00:02.435
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Anna?

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.598
You were ready to die back there
in your cell

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:08.196
rather than suffer any longer.

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:10.318
But Lucie is different.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:12.393
Stronger.

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:16.874
What would kill you or I, she can survive.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.713
Well, physically, anyway.

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:22.316
Mentally, well...

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.839
...the monsters are there.

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:29.551
They've slipped through the cracks
that Dr. Patterson opened.

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:34.112
She's special.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.558
It's easy to create a victim.

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:41.356
You lock a person up in the dark,
and they begin to suffer.

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:43.592
And then you feed that suffering

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:46.594
methodically, precisely to make it last.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.196
The subject goes through
a number of states.

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:53.639
And then there is trauma,
and it opens those cracks.

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:57.801
Does Lucie ever see things
that aren't there?

01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:00.191
Things that may want to hurt her?

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:03.514
Hmm.

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:07.351
These are victims, and like you or I,

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.678
they reach a breaking point.

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:16.115
Martyrs are so much more.

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:18.159
They're so very rare.

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:19.761
So extraordinary.

01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:25.196
Martyrs survive the pain, the torture,

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:29.272
like our Lucie, and they refuse to die.

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:33.155
Martyrs endure
the unspeakable sins of the Earth,

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:36.439
and they give themselves up

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:39.480
and transcend their very being.

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:41.678
You are fucking crazy.

01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:43.759
And when the police come, they're gonna...

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:46.277
Don't speak about things
that you can't possibly understand.

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:49.718
Longsheng Province, 1912.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:53.239
This woman was accused of stealing
food, and she was being punished.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:56.121
This photograph was taken of her
when she was alive.

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:58.034
Look at the eyes.

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.477
Juliette Ducier, 1945.

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.951
She was a grocer who slept with a German.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:07.319
At the time, that didn't sit well
with the French, and she had to pay.

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:09.552
Her eyes still alive.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:15.400
Birmingham, 1960.

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:18.915
A woman in the final stages of cancer
beyond the use of morphine.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.550
She was pronounced dead a dozen times.

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:25.351
And yet she refused to die.

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:28.275
Again, the eyes.

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:31.912
All of them photographed
when they were alive,

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:35.233
all of them seeing something
in their final breaths.

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:39.239
That's what we're recreating.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:40.761
And we're so close.

01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:44.237
That's our hope with Lucie.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:49.752

- Past the human form.
- No.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:39.394

to what she sees.

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:43.316
- No!
- To that final place after life

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:45.279

That's what this is about?

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.872
Why you've been torturing
and killing people for years?

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:01.512
It isn't torture
when it's for a higher purpose.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:15.201

I'd hoped to send you on your way
with some peace, Anna.

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.232

I can't give you that, Anna.
