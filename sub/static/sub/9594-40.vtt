WEBVTT

00:31.532 --> 00:33.334
Prisoner, return
to your cell now.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.437
You telling me what to do?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.239
-Take her down.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.360
Rose Wilson, aka Ravager.

00:59.393 --> 01:03.164
I'm sorry to inform you,
but your parole
has been denied.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.465
Titans, go!

01:04.498 --> 01:07.235
More like
Titans, go... Away.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.838
Hey, that's not nice.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.674
She used Robin's catch phrase
against him!

01:13.707 --> 01:17.311
Robin, am I to go
or to go away?

01:17.345 --> 01:19.713
Her wordplay
has turned the tables on us!

01:19.747 --> 01:23.517
Titans, go... Away!
So good!

01:23.551 --> 01:25.419
Oh yeah? You, Rose Wilson,

01:25.453 --> 01:26.654
are the one
who should go away.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.822
Sure. That was the plan,
genius.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.524
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

01:30.558 --> 01:32.193
We have to
take you down first!

01:32.226 --> 01:34.262
Fine, but I'm warning you.
This is gonna hurt.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.529
Let's do it.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.697
Titans, go!

01:42.170 --> 01:43.904
So? You're short.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.276
She got me
in a very vulnerable area.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.479
Thigh-high boots
and a midriff.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.814
Are you a superhero
or a cheerleader?

01:56.417 --> 01:59.320
Yes. My costume
could use the updating.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.823
Guys, quick! Count to 10
without using your fingers.

02:05.393 --> 02:09.397
-Ah! She knows we're dumb!
-My feelings!

02:11.265 --> 02:12.866
STARFIRE: We have no defense
against her emotional stings.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.206
Nice robe, Gandalf.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.341
Arr. I like your
eye patch, matey.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.843
So do you have a face
or just eyes and a mouth?

02:22.876 --> 02:24.778
Your grandma wants
her hair color back.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.614
You...

02:26.647 --> 02:28.682
You're pretty cool.
I like this whole thing
you got going on.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.519
Thanks. I actually think
your eye patch and hair
are cool, too.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.187
Yeah, they are.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.856
Why aren't you
taking her down, mama?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.491
I don't know. She seems cool.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.893
-We're cool.
-Hmm, no. You're not.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.195
I knew it.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.802
So, uh, what are you
doing right now?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.871
Nothing. Just fighting you.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.507
Wanna do...
I don't know... Whatever?

02:53.541 --> 02:55.476
I don't know. Whatever.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:59.313 --> 03:00.681
Where are you
going with her, Raven?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.316
Her jail cell is that way!

03:02.350 --> 03:04.585
Uh, we're going the long way.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.520
Oh, okay. Thanks.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.229
I like your room. It's dark.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.897
I like your swords. Sharp.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.369
Yeah. My lame dad
got them for me.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.237
Ugh. Dads are the worst.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.805
You hate a lot of things,
don't you?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.374
I like to hate things.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.276
-I like that you hate things.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.711
Raven, have you seen my...
Oh, hey Rose.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.013
Rose? You're supposed
to be in jail!

03:33.046 --> 03:35.716
Yeah, I'm in jail.
You don't need to rub it in.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.785
You are clearly not in jail.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.353
This is Raven's bedroom!

03:39.387 --> 03:40.821
No. This is jail.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.956
I know for a fact
this is not jail!

03:42.990 --> 03:44.292
Raven? Tell her!

03:44.325 --> 03:45.693
Tell her what? She's in jail.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.262
Can I just serve out
my sentence in peace?

03:48.296 --> 03:51.399
Saying you're in jail
does not prove
you're in jail!

03:51.432 --> 03:55.002
And saying I'm not in jail
doesn't prove I'm not in jail!

03:55.035 --> 03:56.704
She's got a point.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.939
Uh, but it's not...
Bars, no jail...

03:58.972 --> 04:01.642
I'm sorry
but visiting hours are over.
The guards are strict.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.811
-But...
-Rules are rules.
You need to leave.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.245
Argh!

04:08.749 --> 04:10.484
Was Raven correct?

04:10.518 --> 04:12.520
Are we not the cool?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.355
Who cares
what Raven says, Star.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.923
I care, bro!

04:15.956 --> 04:17.725
I care a lot!

04:18.759 --> 04:19.960
-Me, too!

04:19.993 --> 04:23.030
-I can't...
-We are the lame!

04:24.698 --> 04:26.334
Well, there's only
one place to go

04:26.367 --> 04:27.435
when you're not cool.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.670
ALL:
Cool School!

04:32.005 --> 04:34.442
Welcome to
Cool School, students!

04:34.475 --> 04:35.576
I'm your professor.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.810
* It's time to get

04:36.844 --> 04:38.579
* Cool, like right, right now

04:38.612 --> 04:40.514
* Y'all Titans
really wanna know how?

04:40.548 --> 04:42.483
* Well, it takes attitude
and confidence

04:42.516 --> 04:44.418
* Mix 'em up together
like pow!

04:44.452 --> 04:45.619
* Hey, Titans!
* What?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.054
* Titans!
* What?

04:47.087 --> 04:48.622
* How do y'all like my butt?
* Say what?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.023
*It's C to the double-O L

04:50.057 --> 04:52.059
* Oh, whoops,
what's that you smell?

04:52.092 --> 04:55.896
* Cool, cool, cool
Super cool *

05:01.101 --> 05:02.570
Hey, wanna jam?

05:02.603 --> 05:04.505
Looks like
the store is closed.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.909
Oh, look, it just opened.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.379
Whoa!

05:57.558 --> 05:59.593
That was fun!

05:59.627 --> 06:01.529
-Ah-ha!

06:01.562 --> 06:04.665
I figured out how to prove
you're not in jail.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.066
Oh, yeah?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.536
That's right!
How can you be in jail

06:08.569 --> 06:10.003
if you're out in the open?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.439
Huh Huh?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.407
Uh, this is the prison yard!

06:13.441 --> 06:15.008
Then where are the walls?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.544
Huh Huh?

06:16.577 --> 06:17.745
Well, you just can't see them

06:17.778 --> 06:19.680
because it's a
really big prison.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.750
Yeah. You've never seen
a big prison before?

06:22.783 --> 06:25.152
Of course I have!
But this is not a prison!

06:25.185 --> 06:27.888
This is a city,
and I am going to prove it!

06:27.921 --> 06:29.690
Shh! Keep it down!

06:29.723 --> 06:31.625
You're gonna
get me into trouble
with the guards.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.733
Aw, man, you look cool!

06:39.767 --> 06:41.969
Look upon the ironic mustache

06:42.002 --> 06:43.604
made of the facial hair.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.706
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what!

06:45.739 --> 06:48.442
Mmm. Look at me lean.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.843
I don't have
a care in the world!

06:49.877 --> 06:51.545
Can't hear you lean, brah.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.014
I'm listening to some
cool underground music.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.849
Not like that terrible
popular music

06:55.883 --> 06:57.518
that all those lame-o's likes.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.219
Yos, yos, the dude.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.055
When you have concluded
listening to the cool music,

07:02.089 --> 07:05.726
you can take a cool ride
on my cool cycle motor.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.461
Vroom-vroom!

07:07.495 --> 07:10.030
I am bad
to the skeleton parts!

07:10.063 --> 07:13.867
Check me out!
Sunglasses inside! At night!

07:13.901 --> 07:16.670
I'm so cool,
I can't see nothing!

07:18.271 --> 07:20.173
Cool!

07:25.813 --> 07:27.147
Wanna see something cool?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.016
-Always.
-Check this out.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.953
Howdy!

07:32.986 --> 07:35.022
Whoa! You almost hit
Sticky Joe!

07:35.055 --> 07:37.224
Okay. I'll do this one
with my eyes closed.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.926
Wait. What if you hit him?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.861
-I do.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.663
Oh, okay, I'm doing it anyway.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.700
Howdy!

07:46.734 --> 07:49.737
I am not gonna let you
throw knives at Sticky Joe.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.505
You telling me what to do?

07:51.539 --> 07:52.806
Someone has to.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.183
Oof!

08:18.231 --> 08:19.933
That's too bad.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.902
I was hoping
we could be friends.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.837
But you know... Whatever.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.006
Rose Wilson!

08:26.039 --> 08:27.608
You're either
going back to jail

08:27.641 --> 08:29.810
or if this is jail,
you're staying here.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.311
What's with the clothes?

08:31.344 --> 08:34.682
Can't you tell?
We went to Cool School.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.550
Cool School is not cool.

08:36.584 --> 08:37.918
But don't worry,
you'll be dead soon

08:37.951 --> 08:39.219
and dead people are cool!

08:49.329 --> 08:51.832
Any uncool last words?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.033
Raven?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.902
We may not be the cool,

08:54.935 --> 08:57.104
but we are the true friends.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.306
And that is more important.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.875
That is so corny.

09:01.909 --> 09:02.976
That's it!

09:03.010 --> 09:04.277
Rose is so cool

09:04.311 --> 09:06.747
her only weakness
is earnest emotions!

09:06.780 --> 09:09.349
We can take her down
with feelings!

09:09.382 --> 09:11.118
Titans, share!

09:11.151 --> 09:12.853
I should say this more often.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.188
You've always been like
a sister to me!

09:17.157 --> 09:18.659
Ugh, you're making a scene.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.895
Oh, come on, guys,
this is embarrassing!

09:21.929 --> 09:23.931
No. No, mama,

09:23.964 --> 09:25.599
let us finish, please.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.735
We thinks
you're the bees knees!

09:27.768 --> 09:31.605
Your lack of irony
is making me sick.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.874
Raven, all we're
trying to say is...

09:33.907 --> 09:34.942
We love you.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.315
I love you guys, too.
Group hug.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.892
ROSE: You're a
real disappointment, Raven.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.027
Well, guess I'm not cool.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.964
Rose Wilson is finally
back in jail.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.966
Actually, you're in jail.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.402
That's, uh, not gonna work
this time, Rose.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.772
Really? Because to me
it looks like

10:04.805 --> 10:06.039
you're behind bars.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.675
Yeah, well, yes, technically,

10:07.708 --> 10:09.309
from your angle
it would appear that way.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.045
Mmm. That's something
someone in jail would say.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.282
Argh! Raven, tell her!
Tell her!

10:17.350 --> 10:19.820
Yeah. She's in jail.
