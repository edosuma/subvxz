You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.540

our other Fox programs--

00:08.542 --> 00:11.610
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.513
What is this,

of my life about it?

Only on Fox.

Oh, are we gonna stay

00:31.465 --> 00:33.232
Roto-Rootered like this
the whole show?

00:33.234 --> 00:35.167
It's rotoscoped, Dad.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.903
Whatever it is,
it's making me sick.

00:37.905 --> 00:41.206
A noble experiment that failed.

BART:
Why is the sky blue?

00:57.825 --> 00:58.824
Hmm...

00:58.826 --> 01:00.259
I don't know.
Just is.

01:00.261 --> 01:03.095
Why are clouds white?
No clue.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.830
Why are people yellow?

01:04.832 --> 01:06.598
It's the way
God made them.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.933
Why is grass green?

01:07.935 --> 01:09.902
So you can find
your damn golf ball.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.336
Now I have
a question for you.

01:11.338 --> 01:14.239
Why did you leave your
toy car on the stairs?

01:15.942 --> 01:17.276
Why is blood red?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.410
Why do you ask?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.446
It's coming out
your ear.
D'oh!

01:20.448 --> 01:22.281
So you'll be staying with Grampa

01:22.283 --> 01:23.949
while your father
is on the mend.

Oh, boy, if I go down there,
I ain't coming up.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.786
My dad won't play
cars with me, either.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.494
But, you know,
it is Bart's birthday.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.696
No, no, no, this is fine.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.565
Just let me fix this.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.566
There.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.067
Now it's all about you.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.135
Happy?

08:58.704 --> 08:59.671
I'll go get him.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.706
Oh, it's no use.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.642
He's walking kind of fast.

09:05.411 --> 09:06.411
Blam!

09:06.413 --> 09:08.079
Blam!

09:08.081 --> 09:09.514
Blam! Blam!

09:09.516 --> 09:11.683
(Milhouse laughing)

09:11.685 --> 09:13.418
Hey, you missed one.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.020
Nope, can't do it,
my Grampa lives there.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.021
(siren whoops)

09:16.023 --> 09:17.656
Stop! Stop right there!

09:17.658 --> 09:19.891
Well, looks like we
finally put an end

09:19.893 --> 09:23.028
to this light-mare on
Elm Street. (chuckles)

09:23.030 --> 09:25.530
Uh, actually, it's, uh,
Maple Street, Chief.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.832
Thank you, joke police.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.568
Please don't
arrest me.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.770
It's a victimless
crime!

09:31.772 --> 09:33.838
MOLEMAN:
Oh, I can't see!

09:33.840 --> 09:35.340
(tires screeching)

09:35.342 --> 09:37.409
(moaning)

09:37.411 --> 09:40.545
Looks like a case of
Molemanslaughter.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.747
Did that sound
right to you, Lou?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.583
I like it.

09:46.786 --> 09:47.919
Thanks for letting me
hide here, Grampa.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.354
Hiding?

09:49.356 --> 09:51.690
This is the best visit
I've had in months!

09:51.692 --> 09:53.858
Aah!

09:58.698 --> 10:00.432
Now, come get
your birthday present.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.133
Whoa!

10:02.135 --> 10:03.868
I've been asking my
parents for this,

10:03.870 --> 10:05.637
but they said
I'd break my neck.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.772
Hey, you're gonna break
your neck sometime.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.274
It's important you do it
when you're young.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.742
Like chicken pox.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.745
Now get out before I say
something else preposterous.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.814
♪

10:25.224 --> 10:29.094
Mom, it's just the Mayo Clinic
Pre-Medical Summer Camp.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.396
I would've been
totally fine on my own.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.831
(horn honks)
No more discussion.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.232
Our cab's here.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.334
Ooh, it's one of
those new Apple cars.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.173
Really think they should've
stuck with computers.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.808
Have a great trip.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.976
Don't you worry.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.412
I'll take good care
of our little guy.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.613
I'm 15!

getting cranky.

Homer, this summer
may be your last chance

10:56.790 --> 10:58.790
to have a close relationship
with your son.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.859
Don't blow it.

11:03.129 --> 11:05.864
So, boy, look at this.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.932
Just us guys, huh?

11:07.934 --> 11:09.300
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)

11:09.302 --> 11:10.835
Glad we've got
the whole summer,

11:10.837 --> 11:12.637
'cause we got a lot
to talk about.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.872
Yeah, I guess.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.840
Let's see.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.776
Um... oh!

11:17.778 --> 11:19.711
When you replace
windshield wipers,

11:19.713 --> 11:21.646
you only need to switch out
the rubber part,

11:21.648 --> 11:23.014
not the whole blade.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.016
Huh, where can you buy
just the rubber part?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.052
I don't know.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.454
Well, I'm glad I told you
that before I died.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.757
So, uh, I'll go to Moe's
while you sort it out, huh?

Hey, thanks for coming.

(giggles)

11:53.246 --> 11:55.680
After washing dishes for a year
they bumped me to prep,

11:55.682 --> 11:57.849
which means I draw up
the schedule, babe.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.885
Wow, no more
Mr. Minimum Wage.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.754
I didn't say that.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.490
So I just got out of juvie
for the streetlight thing.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.058
But I'm not mad.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.828
I've learned that the
greatest crime of all

12:09.830 --> 12:13.264
is a life without faith.

What's wrong?

Is the cross not big enough?!

13:01.448 --> 13:04.048
I mean, India, China...

13:04.050 --> 13:06.117
It's crazy.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.952
Can you just leave me here
with my dad?

All right, sure.

I was terrified.

Because it meant
I wasn't a kid anymore.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.074
I had responsibilities.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.610
Truth is, I'm just like you.

13:32.612 --> 13:36.014
A misunderstood guy who wants
his family to love him.

start with a hug?

Aw, I'm so glad
we're sharing this.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.824

one kid who's never

Hmm.

It's not the size
of the pennant.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.275
It's what you do with it.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.677

Warned you.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.146
Biker, huh?
I used to bike.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.982
I used to have dreams.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.150
I used to think disco
was coming back.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.186
Now I'm just Stu.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.355

Hey, Bart, you are coming
to my graduation party tonight?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.094
I don't know, man.
It's humiliating.

the same year as me.

Nelson, how can you say that
with what's happened to you?

16:44.004 --> 16:47.338
Yeah, well, I bought
a totally bitching car

16:47.340 --> 16:51.042

selling my pituitary gland.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.012
So cool.

when Kearney Jr. graduated.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.791
It's okay, Dad.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.993
We still got K-3.

17:08.995 --> 17:09.994
(coos)

17:09.996 --> 17:11.796
(both laughing)

17:11.798 --> 17:12.797
Right.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.799
Ralph, you joined the army?

17:14.801 --> 17:18.870
Yes, because I needed
a costume for this party.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.239
At college I'm gonna
reinvent myself.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.208
I'll pretend I have
a girlfriend in Canada.

17:24.210 --> 17:28.012
I'll say she lives in Alberta
and her name is Alberta,

17:28.014 --> 17:31.849
so I don't have
to remember two lies.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.384
Bart!

17:33.386 --> 17:34.886
I was getting worried.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.187
I'm your oldest buddy.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.822
I was there when you
got your nose done,

17:37.824 --> 17:40.391
then I was there when you
had your nose undone.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.661
Friends, family, and
a few people we hired

17:43.663 --> 17:46.230
to make our son
look more popular...

17:46.232 --> 17:47.899
I love Milton!

17:47.901 --> 17:49.600
Dad, you're embarrassing me!

17:49.602 --> 17:51.903
As usual.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.505
Yes, it's the only thing
your father does well.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.409
Can't you two put it aside
for one night in honor of me?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.044
No!
No!

18:00.046 --> 18:02.246
Oh.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.414
Ah, what the heck?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.616
Congratulations, Milhouse.

18:05.618 --> 18:09.554
You made it through adolescence
and you're cuter than ever.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.889
Oh, sweet Lisa!

18:11.891 --> 18:13.724
You know I had
a rocky childhood

18:13.726 --> 18:15.526
with all the rocks
they threw at me.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.197
You're the most amazing
thing at this party.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.265
Well, excuse me!

18:22.067 --> 18:23.734
(groans)

18:23.736 --> 18:26.104
I'm not even the best Simpson
at my best friend's party!

18:26.106 --> 18:29.273
Do you know what it's like to
be second-best at anything?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.374
Yeah, I do!

18:30.376 --> 18:31.876
I'm going to Yale!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.478
Listen here, Bart Simpson!

18:33.480 --> 18:35.246
I am sick and tired
of you blaming me

18:35.248 --> 18:37.648
for every setback
you have ever had!

18:37.650 --> 18:40.118
And you have talents, too,
you idiot.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.752
You're a hell of an artist,

18:41.754 --> 18:43.654
even though you don't
do anything with it.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.390
You think I'm an artist?

18:46.392 --> 18:49.660
And you already have a true
artist's most important asset.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.896
A miserable life.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.166
So if that's all my fault,
you're welcome.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.236
Mwah!

Hey, man.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.990
You're looking good.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.325
Thank God Lisa invented

19:21.327 --> 19:23.761
Sorry, didn't mean
to use the "L" word.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.764
Listen, man,
a certain someone convinced me

19:26.766 --> 19:29.500
to go around giving back
the lunch money I took.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.936
Here's the first $5,000.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.037
Wow.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.039
Thanks.
What got into you?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.507
Nelson, come on!

19:36.509 --> 19:39.710
We'll miss day six

19:39.712 --> 19:41.179
You guys are dating?

19:41.181 --> 19:42.780
Is there any other reason
I'd be going

19:42.782 --> 19:44.715
to a Bolivian Film Festival?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.350
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you, Bart.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.053
I don't really know
how you feel about me.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.722
Well, you told me I was
an artist, and you were right.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.058
I am, and...

19:54.060 --> 19:56.327

Wow, that's beautiful.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.332

there's no me.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.367
Ah, those are the breaks.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.570
Why don't I buy you and your
boyfriend a couple beers?

20:05.572 --> 20:06.737
Just let me close up.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.172
That would be nice.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.474

20:16.749 --> 20:18.816
Well, I'm glad I did.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.254
Hmm?
