WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.204
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.522
We need your help.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.659
There are three of them.
Esme, Sophie and Phoebe.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.661
They're politically connected,
wealthy; one of them

00:27.695 --> 00:30.764
even infiltrated Senator
Montez's campaign last year.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.566
That jackass is
a straight-up Purifier.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.668
They've got the right enemies,
that's for damn sure.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.604
-CAITLIN: We're leaving.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.938
With Esme and her sisters back,
we can't stay.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.507
I don't want to be here, either.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.041
That's why we have
to stick together.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.444
FROST SISTERS: We're here
about the Hound program.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.546
-It's looking to expand.
-We want your help to stop it.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.181
POLARIS:
And you can get us to Campbell?

00:47.215 --> 00:48.849
We can end this?

00:48.882 --> 00:51.585
We wouldn't be here
if we couldn't.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.355
Your father was a member
of the Hellfire Club, a king.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.724
You want to protect
the child? Join us.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.359
They murdered a dozen people
without even blinking.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.528
-Fire.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.530
We need all the allies
we can get.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.099
No, the X-Men
chose us for a reason,

01:05.133 --> 01:08.236
and it's not 'cause we can kill.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.070
CAMPBELL: We now have a weapon
that provides a solution

01:10.104 --> 01:11.772
to our mutant problem.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.542
Hounds bonded,
their powers combined.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.809
Put together a demonstration.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.578
Bring it to Washington
this week.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.055
CAMPBELL:
Breathe a little deeper.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.957
Come on, Jack, breathe for me.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.660
JACK: I'm trying.
I just can't catch...

01:36.830 --> 01:39.633
CAMPBELL: That's it, that's it.
That's good.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.171
That's good. Just get it out.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.339
Come on. Here.

01:45.373 --> 01:48.442
Don't you got
a lecture to get to?

01:48.476 --> 01:51.078
-No.
-I'm all right, bro.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.081
No, you're not.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.684
Your lung capacity's down 30%.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.319
We need to talk to your doctor.

01:58.352 --> 02:02.423
It's not the doctors, Rod.
I'm running out of time here.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.024
Hey, don't talk like that.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.461
-JACK: Well, it's the truth.
-Come on.

02:07.495 --> 02:11.565
Doctors told Mom that CF would
kill me before I hit 40.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.170
I'm already bucking
the odds here.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.706
Okay, okay, just...

02:18.739 --> 02:20.941
Calm down.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.645
-Here.
-Go.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.781
You're already late, bro.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.050
Just go.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.553
I'll be fine.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.200
It's okay.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.969
CAMPBELL:
One gene.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.806
A tiny thing,
less than a micron across,

02:52.840 --> 02:56.410
but so terribly,
terribly powerful.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.547
A mutation in the DNA sequence
of a single gene

02:59.580 --> 03:03.251
can mean the difference
between a long, healthy life

03:03.284 --> 03:06.019
or a death sentence.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.989
If I've learned one thing
in my years as a scientist,

03:09.022 --> 03:12.426
it's that Mother Nature
shows us no mercy.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.663
She's not our friend.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.331
We're just another
species on Earth,

03:17.365 --> 03:20.067
forced to struggle
for our survival.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.604
For most of the last
two million years,

03:23.637 --> 03:26.774
Homo sapiens weren't
the only species of human.

03:26.807 --> 03:30.244
The Neanderthal--
stronger than we are.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.745
Had better resistance to cold.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.447
And contrary
to conventional wisdom,

03:33.481 --> 03:35.082
they even had bigger brains.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.619
So how did we stop them
from taking over the planet?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.187
Why am I up here talking to you,

03:40.220 --> 03:43.357
instead of some fellow
with a double

03:44.958 --> 03:47.461
Because genetics
don't have to be destiny.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.397
We worked together.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.432
We out-communicated
the Neanderthals.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.934
We built societies
to defend each other

03:53.967 --> 03:56.970
and literally wipe our enemies
off the face of the Earth.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.407
They had stronger genes,
no doubt about it.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.142
But we managed to level
the playing field.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.111
And now, once again,

04:04.144 --> 04:06.947
Mother Nature has rolled
the evolutionary dice

04:06.980 --> 04:08.916
and created a new breed

04:08.949 --> 04:11.084
with powerful mutations
and abilities.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.754
Some among us worry that
we're in danger of extinction.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.389
Well, they're right to worry.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.924
But we don't have to succumb

04:16.957 --> 04:19.059
to the cosmic injustice
of genetics.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.463
This time, we can harness the
power of science for ourselves.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.131
But if, and only if,

04:24.164 --> 04:27.435
we have the courage
to stand together as a species.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.809
*

04:41.014 --> 04:42.783
I just want to make
something clear.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.318
We're working with you on this

04:44.352 --> 04:46.820
because the Hound program
is a threat to all of us.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.289
But if any of you think
that being here means...

04:49.323 --> 04:51.759
-Oh,
you made it clear we're not.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.428
We're just here to get
a job done, same as you.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.331
Marcos, they're right.
Stay cool.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.334
I don't see a move here.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.835
The Hounds are
already out there.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.270
They're kicking our asses.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.439
ESME: It's a secret program.
We can kill it,

05:05.473 --> 05:06.807
but it has to happen soon.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.476
Our sources tell us Dr. Campbell

05:08.509 --> 05:09.877
is working
his political connections

05:09.910 --> 05:12.145
-to take it national.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.781
He's attending
the Humanity Today Summit

05:13.814 --> 05:16.517
-in Charlotte, tomorrow.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.386
Is that seriously
what they call it?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.687
-Mm.
-ESME: I guess they thought

05:19.720 --> 05:21.722
it sounded better than
"Kill the Muties."

05:21.755 --> 05:24.458
Every major anti-mutant figure
will be there.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.159
Politicians, business leaders...

05:26.193 --> 05:28.195
Purifiers.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.464
Security will be massive.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.300
There's got to be
a better... -We're out of time.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.335
This is our chance
to grab Campbell and use him

05:35.369 --> 05:38.038
-to smash the program.
-So we're kidnappers now.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.073
I thought we're supposed to be
the good guys.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.911
Let's not get
so high and mighty.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.146
I don't suppose you've shared
your criminal past

05:46.179 --> 05:47.247
with everyone here?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.051
Do they not know
about your old friends?

05:52.453 --> 05:53.854
Because we do.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.493
But the past is in the past.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.929
Right now, we have work to do.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.769
It's funny.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.071
Half of me can't believe
we're still stuck here,

06:11.104 --> 06:14.708
and the other half is
happy to be home.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.877
Just glad we didn't
lose our old beds.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.846
Well, you are losing
your pillow.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.113
I get the good one this time.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.885
Uh, we're heading up
to Charlotte tomorrow.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.920
Might be our only chance
to grab to Campbell; and once

06:26.954 --> 06:29.022
we have him, we're gonna need
every angle we can get.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.091
Did you have any luck looking
at your father's research?

06:31.124 --> 06:33.026
Not much. He just gave me
his old notebooks.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.863
And to be honest, I couldn't
follow much of the science.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.732
THUNDERBIRD: Well, anything
you can get could be useful.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.200
His research helped build
the Hound program.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.869
If we're trying
to take it apart...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.704
I guess it's best
to start at the beginning.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.806
We'll work on it.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.843
-Good luck up there.
-Thanks.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.416
John. We need to talk.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.753
Hey, listen, whatever the Frosts
said about your past, I don't...

06:59.787 --> 07:02.155
No, it's...
I-I need to explain.

07:02.189 --> 07:05.392
Clarice, we got a lot
to do right now, okay?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.595
Will you please just listen?

07:07.628 --> 07:10.898
Back in Clarke County, I had
trouble with some Purifiers.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.467
Basically got run out of town.
I was pissed.

07:13.501 --> 07:16.069
Started looking for people
who felt the same way.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.006
I found some mutants
who were pushing back.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.209
And it turned out that they were
part of the Brotherhood.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.847
-I didn't join anything.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.316
I helped them with a few things,
and when they asked me

07:29.349 --> 07:31.685
to do stuff
I wasn't down for, I bailed.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.920
Why didn't you tell us?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.287
Sage asked me
what I was arrested for.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.222
Nothing I did with them...

07:35.255 --> 07:38.025
That's not how it works,
and you know it.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.762
I know I shouldn't have
worked with them, but...

07:41.795 --> 07:46.534
It's not about that.
It's about hiding it from us.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.503
Look...

07:49.537 --> 07:52.706
I didn't tell you this
before because...

07:52.740 --> 07:56.644
for the first time in forever,
I felt safe.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.814
I just didn't want to lose that.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.487
You know, when you ran off,
and I went to look for you,

08:07.521 --> 08:10.323
I did that because I thought
you were one of us.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.829
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.576
Mr. Wong, please tell me
you have some results.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.244
Actually, Dr. Campbell,
we've run into some issues.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.147
Issues? We handed you
an entire archive.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.316
Reams of data from
Otto Strucker's research.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.586
If he was able to suppress
the X-Gene in his son,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.053
his conclusions
must be in there.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.322
I know, sir, but it appears that

08:42.355 --> 08:44.925
a significant portion
of his research is missing.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.493
Then I suggest you look harder.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.662
What you need to understand,
the Hound project

08:48.696 --> 08:51.398
is the key to fighting them off,
but Otto Strucker's research

08:51.431 --> 08:53.934
can help us wipe out
the X-Gene entirely.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.204
If some of it is missing,
we need to find it. Understood?

08:57.237 --> 08:58.772
Of course, sir.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.018
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.287
Before we head out,
I... I want to talk to you.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.456
Yeah. What is it?

09:16.489 --> 09:19.259
It's about the Frosts.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.394
What about them?

09:21.428 --> 09:24.031
Look, we're working with them,
like it or not.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.432
Yeah, I'm in the "not" camp.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.636
I'm not asking you to change
your mind about them,

09:28.669 --> 09:30.070
but we have a job to do.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.239
What do you expect me
to do, Lorna?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.941
Pretend like we're
one big happy family?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.909
No, of course not.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.411
Come on. We're the family.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.881
That's the point.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.316
There's no way
they could come between us.

09:46.186 --> 09:50.824
Look, don't do this for them,
do this for me.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.095
Okay.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.611
Are you seriously
reading that book again?

10:11.645 --> 10:13.146
Why do you care?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.482
Shouldn't you be hanging out
with your boyfriend?

10:15.515 --> 10:18.952
Wes went back to Augusta,
for your information.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.121
You barely put that thing down.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.991
So? There's stuff
about our family in here.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.625
-No, thank you.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.495
I know all I need to know about
our psycho great-grandfather.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.097
He wasn't a psycho.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.932
All right, this book
was written by humans.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.433
It's totally biased against us.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.103
Andreas and his sister
were trying to build something.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.006
-Uh, a-a place for mutants.
-Andy.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.373
Why don't you look around?

10:40.407 --> 10:43.010
We are literally
in a place for mutants.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.511
No, no, I don't mean,
like, a place to hide.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.815
-That's all we're doing here...
-No. No, it isn't.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.817
The Underground
is saving people.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.518
Those people were murderers.

10:51.551 --> 10:55.055
You've heard of
the American Revolution, right?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.456
Nobody ever called
George Washington

10:56.489 --> 10:58.458
a murderer for fighting back
against England.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.961
This isn't some
war fantasy, okay?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.229
Whatever.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.197
Now everybody's freaking out

11:04.231 --> 11:06.199
about the Frost Sisters
for some reason.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.836
At least they treat us
like adults.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.904
The Frost Sisters?

11:10.938 --> 11:13.340
Don't tell me
they got in your head.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.908
God.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.645
-Those girls are liars.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.413
Maybe they're the only ones
around here

11:20.447 --> 11:22.850
who are actually
telling the truth.

11:41.068 --> 11:44.671
GUARD:
Badges, please.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.941
Good afternoon, Dr. Campbell,
Director Wolcott.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.545
All right, you're all set.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.547
*

12:15.735 --> 12:17.204
MAN:
Everybody's saying it.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.705
We just got to get ready, man.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.774
Hard times are coming.
You know what I mean, man?

12:20.808 --> 12:23.710
We just got to,
got to do something about it.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.047
Great, look who's back.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.382
Are you talking about me?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.984
Let's just say
some folks were happy

12:31.018 --> 12:32.285
when you left for Fairburn.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.088
I don't know
what your problem is,

12:35.122 --> 12:37.557
but we're on the same side here.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.759
You keep saying that.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.095
Doesn't make it true.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.007
Hey.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.909
You okay?

12:55.943 --> 12:58.245
Mm. It's nothing.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.014
-Not much.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.415
Most of my dad's research

13:02.449 --> 13:04.417
that we found is
from his grad school days,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.286
but we can't find much
of his work on mutants.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.922
There's something else.
We're not the only ones looking.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.290
What are you talking about?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.292
I've been checking
the genetic research boards.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.761
Trask is talking to everyone
Otto Strucker ever worked with.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.198
They're even sending someone to
an insurance company in Decatur.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.201
Wait.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.170
Southern Worldwide.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.139
That's where your mom works.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.650
Hey, speed demon.
You missed the bean sprouts.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.486
Yeah, well, excuse me
for not being

13:39.519 --> 13:41.821
a professional waterer guy.
This is stupid.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.556
You think Campbell's gardening
right now?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.825
The Underground is
going after him, okay?

13:45.859 --> 13:47.861
We should be doing that, too.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.497
The way those mutants
who ambushed us in Fairburn

13:50.530 --> 13:53.333
combined their powers,
their hands were joined.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.369
Campbell got that from us.
We should be doing something.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.706
Like what?
Going out and attacking people?

13:59.739 --> 14:02.342
That's not how it works.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.078
This place is a team
and we're part of that.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.479
CAITLIN:
Kids, we need to go.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.215
Sentinel Services and Trask
is sending someone

14:08.248 --> 14:09.582
to speak to my mom.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.019
Grandma Ellen?
They already talked to her.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.086
That was just harassment.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.354
This time, they're after
something real:

14:14.387 --> 14:17.324
-my dad's research.
-We need to get to her first.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.228
-Let's go.
-Come on.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.736
*

14:47.220 --> 14:48.888
ECLIPSE: I thought we were
coming to a safe house.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.691
-It is safe. -And it's a house.
-Hence the term.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.693
It's just so bougie.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.528
Well, if it'll make you
feel more at home,

14:55.562 --> 14:57.530
we could bring in some mold,
smash some holes in the floor.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.233
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.403
I'll see them inside.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.908
Hey.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.878
Just here to do a job, remember?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.647
Yeah, babe. I remember.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.821
There's a full security system,

15:21.854 --> 15:24.591
and we're set up for a variety
of interrogation methods.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.127
Although, I should be able to
extract any information we need.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.462
And you have a fully stocked bar
because...?

15:29.496 --> 15:31.898
Breaking Campbell
could take a while.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.101
Why live in squalor?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.336
The X-Men started your little
crew before they vanished.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.338
Our founders,
they left us with more

15:38.371 --> 15:40.573
than a pat on the back
and encouraging words.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.975
You're talking about
the Brotherhood.

15:42.009 --> 15:45.278
So he's pretty and clever.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.180
In half an hour,
our ticket into the summit

15:47.214 --> 15:48.915
will be driving down a road
near here.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.850
We best get ready.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.028
This is your room.
Hope it's big enough.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.596
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.766
Um, can we talk for a moment?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.768
About what

16:08.801 --> 16:10.770
I'm just really glad
you're here.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.772
Sometimes it seems like
you're the only one

16:12.805 --> 16:14.641
who knows what needs
to get done.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.277
-Your boyfriend... -Okay,
let's not bring him into this.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.811
Look, just because
he's concerned

16:18.845 --> 16:20.313
doesn't mean he knows
what's best.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.648
I'm not discussing this
with you.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.616
Lorna, you can do things
others can't.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.486
-Your friends, they don't...
-Stop talking about my friends!

16:30.723 --> 16:32.959
Not bad.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.296
You've been getting
stronger lately, haven't you?

16:36.329 --> 16:39.999
I can see your father's power
in you.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.902
You know, some people think
pregnant women are fragile.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.637
But there is nothing stronger

16:44.671 --> 16:46.773
than a woman
with something to fight for.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.523
You know where
Grandma's office is?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.992
Hopefully. I haven't been here
for a couple years.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.660
Okay, call if you see anything.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.830
If we run into trouble,
you two head back immediately.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.299
Understand?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.237
Come on.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.678
-Yeah.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.080
You okay?

17:27.114 --> 17:29.449
Yeah, just remembering what
happened when I saw my dad.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.519
-Hey. This won't be like that.
-Hey.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.555
Uh... aren't you...

17:35.588 --> 17:37.690
um...

17:37.724 --> 17:41.561
You guys are, uh...
I-I know you. You're...

17:41.594 --> 17:44.631
Ally and Mark Young
from the party last year.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.866
Hey. It's good to see you, man.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.336
Yeah. I-I thought I...

17:50.737 --> 17:53.306
Uh, will you say hello
to your wife for me?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.974
We had, we had
such a great time.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.444
Tell her,
"It's all about the donuts."

17:58.645 --> 18:00.780
She'll know what
I'm talking about.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.616
-Okay, sure.
-It's good to see you, man.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.255
That was... wow.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.722
Okay, don't be too impressed.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.991
He's still suspicious.
Just keep moving.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.960
Her office is over here.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.168
ELLEN:
What does it take for somebody

18:21.201 --> 18:23.836
to clean a coffee cup
around here?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.308
Reed.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.476
-Shh, shh, shh.
-Caitlin.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.743
-Hey, hey.
-Hi.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.479
-Stay calm.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.415
-In my office.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.817
Um, my-my assistant's
gone today.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.752
-It's okay.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.422
The police said--
How are the babies?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.191
They're fine.
Look, I'll explain.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.359
We don't have a lot of time.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.604
Keep looking that way.
Sentinel Services comes,

18:57.637 --> 18:59.306
they could drive up
in either direction.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.611
What are you doing?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.613
Something happens,
we need to be ready.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.048
If we get into trouble,
we can make it worse if we...

19:09.081 --> 19:10.517
If we what?

19:10.550 --> 19:12.385
You understand
who we are, right?

19:12.419 --> 19:14.354
What we can do.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.457
Sentinel Services does show up,
we're not the ones in trouble.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.958
They are.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.461
Andy.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.863
Look, our power comes
with responsibility.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.132
The last thing we want is
for them to be scared of us.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.567
Maybe they should be scared.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.302
If they were
a little more scared,

19:29.336 --> 19:30.870
they wouldn't be
coming after our grandma

19:30.903 --> 19:32.739
just because
she's related to us.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.245
I don't understand. How would
I know about Otto's research?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.846
I haven't seen the man in years.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.847
That won't matter to them.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.181
We just need you
to come with us.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.250
I-I have claims
to fill out and...

19:43.283 --> 19:46.018
Ellen, I know this sound crazy,
but it's true.

19:46.052 --> 19:49.222
If these people even think
you know something useful...

19:49.256 --> 19:51.324
What could I possibly know?

19:52.592 --> 19:55.862
And you want me to run?

19:55.895 --> 19:59.499
You're asking me
to run away from my entire life.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.269
-It's not that simple.
-I don't think you understand

20:02.302 --> 20:03.503
how serious this is.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.171
-They came for Dad.
-Perfect.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.673
Then it's Otto's issue.
Let them talk with him.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.908
Mom, they killed him.

20:08.941 --> 20:12.545
What?
What

20:12.579 --> 20:14.447
I was there, Mom.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.416
They shot him.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.689
MAN: And religious issues
break the same way.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.458
About 30% of Evangelicals

20:25.492 --> 20:27.860
think that God's message
was for humans.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.863
A plurality believe the mutants
should be given sanctuary.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.799
MONTEZ:
Listen, there's no question that

20:32.832 --> 20:34.100
we've got a messaging issue.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.368
Gun rights folks split

20:35.402 --> 20:36.803
down the middle
on mutant issues, too,

20:36.836 --> 20:38.705
but the tides are turning.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.139
Well, I hope you're right,
Senator.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.374
Look forward to your talk later.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.042
-Oh, thank you.
-Sarah, good to see you.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.777
-Yes.
-Senator Montez.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.579
Dr. Campbell.
So good to see you again.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.114
-Always a pleasure. Sarah.

20:48.147 --> 20:52.619
-I, uh, heard about the tragedy
at Trask recently. -Ah.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.986
-Was horrible.
-It was.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.622
But ultimately
it just underlines

20:55.655 --> 20:56.956
the importance of our work.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.291
The mutants
wouldn't have attacked

20:58.325 --> 21:00.059
if they didn't understand
we were on the cusp of victory.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.129
Well, I'm just glad you got
to come to the conference.

21:03.162 --> 21:06.065
It's so important to tap into
this energy and enthusiasm.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.735
I'm not much into politics, but
it is nice to be around people

21:08.768 --> 21:09.969
who see the issue
with clear eyes.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.805
Well said. I'm looking forward
to our meeting.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.907
CAMPBELL: So am I. I've got
some exciting developments.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.976
Like to talk with you
about expanding our efforts.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.745
-Yes.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.748
No. We discussed this
when we visited Trask.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.183
I am aware, but the situation
has evolved since then.

21:24.216 --> 21:27.520
The agenda for today's meeting
is already set.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.856
We're talking about fighting
for humanity's survival.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.458
The senator is
in a unique position

21:31.491 --> 21:32.659
to help us with our cause.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.993
I think that merits revisiting

21:34.026 --> 21:35.928
a few funding priorities,
don't you?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.930
-I...
-Let's hear the man out.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.032
-I'll see you soon.
-Till then.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.836
Dr. Campbell.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.811
The Frost sisters are supposed
to be so well-connected.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.480
This was the best way
into the summit?

21:53.513 --> 21:56.282
Look, guy's a big fund-raiser
for anti-mutant causes.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.618
He attends the Humanity Today
Summit every year.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.787
If we're with him,
we get past the gate.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.121
Yeah, I looked him up.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.956
Guy made a ton of money
in pharmaceuticals.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.226
When he retired, he decided he
wanted to contribute to society.

22:07.259 --> 22:11.130
Oh, yes. His way of giving back
was going after mutants.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.499
This should be fun.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.634
Lorna.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.504
I will play nice if he does.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.676
They're on board
with this, right?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.178
Yeah. They're in.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.314
We're looking for
a silver sedan.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.816
Should be through here shortly.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.018
-Very.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.186
He has an appointment with
a certain reclusive billionaire.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.989
Unfortunately for him,
the billionaire's a mutant,

22:37.023 --> 22:39.892
-and a friend of ours.
-Mm.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.495
Still angry I brought up
your checkered past?

22:42.529 --> 22:44.063
How'd you even know about that?

22:44.096 --> 22:45.898
If you're poking around
in my mind,

22:45.932 --> 22:48.735
-I will portal you in front of
a moving truck. -Oh, please.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.269
There was no need
for a mind reading.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.540
We have quite the network,
and everyone talks.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.845
I don't see what you're
so wound up about.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.648
My point is that
we have a lot in common.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.386
-Yup.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.555
Let's do this.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.389
Time to go.

23:43.422 --> 23:47.326
You're asking me to believe
that my ex

23:47.359 --> 23:49.061
And-and he kept it

23:49.095 --> 23:51.631
-Mom, you must've had some idea.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.800
-You lived together
for 26 years. -No.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.068
No, not about this. No.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.137
I mean, he had
his secrets, but...

23:58.170 --> 24:01.407
Mom, I was there
when he used his powers.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.611
But it's not just that.
You know when I got sick?

24:04.644 --> 24:06.145
-Yes.

24:06.178 --> 24:10.249
That was him using a serum
to block the X-Gene in me.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.417
Oh, God.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.085
And that serum is probably
what they're looking for.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.287
If they find it,
they could wipe mutants

24:15.321 --> 24:16.222
off the face of the Earth.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.257
Please think.
Did Dad have another lab?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.592
Not that I know of.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.693
Was there anyone
who he worked with

24:20.727 --> 24:22.128
-outside of Trask...
-Okay, we can talk

24:22.161 --> 24:23.429
-about this later.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.364
-We have to go.
-I can't.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.100
-I can't just leave
out of nowhere.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.269
Dad. Sentinel Services is here.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.839
Have they seen you? You got to
get out of there before...

24:32.872 --> 24:35.708
No, not yet. But they're coming.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.451
:
Honey, this is crazy.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.819
Mom, what's wrong?

24:46.853 --> 24:48.988
-We're running from the police.
-I know, I know.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.724
-But we've got to keep moving.
All right? -This way.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.728
-Here, I'll take it.

24:55.762 --> 24:58.731
Go, go, go. Hit it.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.474
If they get to the back
of the building,

25:08.507 --> 25:10.242
maybe we can find
an emergency exit or something.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.578
There's no time.
What about the car?

25:11.611 --> 25:14.647
We can ditch the car.
It's safer to get everybody out.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.916
Safe for who

25:16.949 --> 25:18.885
-We just have to hold them off.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.721
Protecting our family.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.656
Wait, that's one of
the Struckers.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.258
Hands in the air!

25:26.292 --> 25:28.160
Stop!

25:28.194 --> 25:30.162
I said, put your hands
in the air.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.931
Right now.
Where I can see them.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.012
Leave our family alone!

25:46.045 --> 25:48.014
Andy, stop! They're hurt!

25:48.047 --> 25:51.350
-They still have guns.
-Andy, stop!

25:51.383 --> 25:52.985
What the hell?!

26:12.471 --> 26:13.873
CAITLIN:
Lauren

26:13.906 --> 26:16.175
Let's go!

26:33.325 --> 26:36.896
-Impressive.
-We've made great strides.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.631
And with the proper
legislative support,

26:38.665 --> 26:40.099
we could expand immediately.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.968
I'm flying to D.C.
after the summit.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.637
To be candid,
I can't do this alone.

26:44.671 --> 26:48.074
Now, you know I've always
appreciated Trask's support.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.842
But we do have to be careful

26:49.876 --> 26:51.811
with the optics
on these types of things.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.112
You're worried about
public opinion.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.314
Getting tough on mutant crime
polls well,

26:55.347 --> 26:56.916
but stuff like this?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.317
MONTEZ:
Listen, we are still paying

26:58.350 --> 26:59.919
for the mistakes
from the early days

26:59.952 --> 27:01.253
of the Sentinel robot program.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.621
With respect,
this is very different.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.257
In the assault on the Fairburn
Mutant Underground station,

27:05.291 --> 27:07.093
37 mutant terrorists captured,

27:07.126 --> 27:08.695
not one Sentinel Service
agent hurt.

27:08.728 --> 27:11.297
Still, rounding up
the kind of support we'd need

27:11.330 --> 27:14.133
-to pass a new bill...

27:14.166 --> 27:16.102
You have
a well-earned reputation

27:16.135 --> 27:17.436
for taking this threat
seriously.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.271
The public is hungry
for real solutions.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.841
If you want to be more than
just a senator from Georgia,

27:21.874 --> 27:24.110
there's far worse things
than being the man

27:24.143 --> 27:27.179
who won the war
for humanity's future.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.857
You're making a big mistake.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.391
There'll be people
looking for me.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.560
I guess they're gonna be
disappointed, then.

27:41.593 --> 27:44.163
I have to be in a meeting,
and if I don't show...

27:44.196 --> 27:46.032
Oh, don't worry
about the meeting.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.200
We just need you
to make a phone call.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.843
WOMAN : Thank you
for calling Humanity Today.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.478
Hello. This is Franklin Bennett.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.414
Hello. This is
Franklin Bennett.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.651
I need to make a change
to my security detail.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.687
I need to make
a change to my security detail.

28:08.721 --> 28:10.823
WOMAN: Of course, Mr. Bennett.
One moment, please.

28:10.857 --> 28:14.260
These guard uniforms?

28:14.293 --> 28:16.495
They have our shirt sizes.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.664
These people aren't
screwing around here.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.400
John. All this time I've spent
trying to convince you

28:21.433 --> 28:23.569
of things, I could've just
bought you a nice shirt.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.504
I know that you're not
about to go out

28:25.537 --> 28:27.339
and start the Frost Sisters
fan club,

28:27.373 --> 28:29.742
but if someone is gonna
offer me this kind of help

28:29.776 --> 28:32.611
to take down the people
who killed Sonya

28:32.644 --> 28:35.381
and killed Pulse, I'm in.

28:35.414 --> 28:39.185
I'm going along with this
for you and for Lorna.

28:39.218 --> 28:43.589
But... I got to tell you this,
I don't like it.

28:43.622 --> 28:46.092
When I was in Afghanistan,
in the Marines,

28:46.125 --> 28:48.460
I had to work with
a lot of folks I did not like.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.696
But you fight the fight
that's in front of you.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.599
Eyes on the prize.
We got to grab Campbell today.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.907
I don't know what good
this outfit does.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.641
One look at my eyes...

29:02.674 --> 29:05.211
Yeah, they get close enough
to see your eyes,

29:05.244 --> 29:07.814
my hair, or the fact that
three of us are the same person,

29:07.847 --> 29:09.248
then it's over already.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.152
Something piss you off?

29:16.923 --> 29:20.126
Yeah. They tried
working on me, too.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.662
Their whole "we're not
so different" thing.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.264
Yeah, well, uh...

29:25.297 --> 29:27.133
they might have
a point with that.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.901
What are you talking about?

29:28.935 --> 29:31.737
They, uh...

29:31.770 --> 29:35.107
they talked about the guy
they think is my birth father.

29:35.141 --> 29:38.077
-Said he was a part of all this.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.579
Lorna, I know about this.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.348
You don't get born
looking like me

29:42.381 --> 29:46.485
without having major X-Genes
in your family tree.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.188
You know, for a while,
I thought that mattered.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.190
I thought that all the bad guys

29:51.223 --> 29:54.226
in my family's past
made me one, too.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.431
Took me too long to realize
that a tiny speck of DNA,

29:59.465 --> 30:02.501
it doesn't take charge
of who you are.

30:04.736 --> 30:08.340
I really hope you realize that
sooner than I did.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.445
You think you're gonna
get away with this?

30:13.479 --> 30:15.214
They're gonna track you down

30:15.247 --> 30:17.616
and exterminate you
like cockroaches.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.185
Is that so?

30:19.218 --> 30:21.453
You don't even deserve
to breathe the same air

30:21.487 --> 30:22.688
as human beings.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.623
You don't want to breathe
the same air?

30:24.656 --> 30:28.194
-Then stop breathing.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.466
We can see inside your sick
little mind, Mr. Bennett.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.137
We can see the videos you watch
of mutants being tortured.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.039
We can feel the hate.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.310
Hey.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.412
-That's enough.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.314
You think torturing
some sad old bigot's

30:48.347 --> 30:49.815
gonna make our job any easier?

30:49.848 --> 30:52.985
Cut it out. Now.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.721
You're no fun.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.275
REED: Yeah, we got away,
but they saw the car,

31:16.308 --> 31:17.944
so we're dumping it.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.678
Okay, we'll be there.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.580
Thanks.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.682
You sure you're all right,
Ellen?

31:23.715 --> 31:25.217
I'm fine, sweetie.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.453
It's just a bit much.

31:27.486 --> 31:31.057
I'm sorry, Mom.
I wish this wasn't happening.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.792
I wish I could help you, but...

31:33.825 --> 31:36.362
if your father had
some secret lab somewhere,

31:36.395 --> 31:38.197
he sure as hell never told me.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.632
Well, maybe it wasn't
another lab.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.635
Maybe... maybe he used to
talk to someone?

31:43.669 --> 31:46.772
Maybe he used to
go somewhere or...

31:46.805 --> 31:48.807
What?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.742
What is it?

31:50.776 --> 31:54.746
Um, it may be nothing.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.483
There was this researcher.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.552
She and your father used to talk
late at night, and...

32:00.586 --> 32:02.989
and they went
on a trip together,

32:03.022 --> 32:04.991
and I confronted him.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.559
I was convinced he was
having an affair with her.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.229
He promised that
he'd never see her again.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.897
Did you ever meet her?

32:11.930 --> 32:14.333
Yes. Once at the house.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.770
She came to see you.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.211
Uh, do you remember her name?

32:26.712 --> 32:29.415
Madeline Risman.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.284
It was decades ago.

32:32.318 --> 32:36.522
Oh, Reed, I am so sorry.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.823
For what?

32:37.856 --> 32:41.460
All that time,
Otto was making you sick.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.928
A-And I knew
there was something wrong,

32:42.961 --> 32:46.532
but I was desperate, and he said
that he would cure you.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.470
I should've protected you, baby.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.240
-I'm sorry. -You did the best
you could, Mom.

32:58.210 --> 33:01.147
We all did.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.893
REED: The Underground is
sending someone to pick us up.

33:14.926 --> 33:16.728
Is Grandma coming with us?

33:16.762 --> 33:18.664
Yeah. You'll have to lay low
for a while.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.366
LAUREN:
We've been staying with a group.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.634
An underground group
that helps mutants.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.504
-You'll like it there.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.077
But I can't go with you.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.578
What?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.180
-Ellen, you...
-Look at me.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.483
I-I would just hold you up.
I saw what happened back there.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.552
Those people who are after you,
they mean business.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.254
But they're coming
after all of us now.

33:42.288 --> 33:44.890
-You can't just go home.

33:44.923 --> 33:47.593
Reed, do I look like
a complete idiot?

33:49.195 --> 33:51.029
I have a friend in Boca Raton.

33:51.063 --> 33:54.200
Lives way out of town.
I have enough cash to get there.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.867
Uh...

33:58.304 --> 34:00.939
Believe me, it's best.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.613
LAUREN:
Grandma.

34:09.548 --> 34:13.619
I know it's weird
that we're mutants.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.355
But we're still the same people
we've always been.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.889
Oh, no, sweetheart.

34:17.923 --> 34:21.093
No, that's not true.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.129
You're more.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.331
You're so much more.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.942
Andy.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.813
-CHOIR: * America, America...
-And I couldn't be more proud

34:41.847 --> 34:44.216
to introduce a man
who's been coming here

34:44.250 --> 34:45.717
for more than a decade,

34:45.751 --> 34:49.388
a man who has always fought
for our future,

34:49.421 --> 34:51.557
a human future.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.760
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Montez.

34:54.793 --> 35:00.466
-* From sea to shining sea.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.973
Thank you.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.879
GUARD:
May I see your badges?

35:18.984 --> 35:20.952
Welcome, Mr. Bennett.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.858
All right, you're all clear.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.828
Thank you. Them, too.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.799
MONTEZ:
You know, I've always said

35:33.832 --> 35:37.035
this summit is the birthplace
of great ideas.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.205
And we need those ideas.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.273
We need your energy
and enthusiasm.

35:41.307 --> 35:45.010
We need it
to take our country back.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.392
MONTEZ:
Since 7/15,

36:00.426 --> 36:02.961
we've been a nation
under siege.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.298
People live in fear while
the mutants who terrorize them

36:06.332 --> 36:08.467
hide behind the Constitution.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.636
Was that the founders' intent?

36:10.669 --> 36:12.238
To prevent their sons
and daughters

36:12.271 --> 36:14.873
from defending themselves?
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:14.906 --> 36:18.210
the Constitution
is a human document,

36:18.244 --> 36:20.812
written by humans for humans.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.316
It is time to stop being
politically correct,

36:24.350 --> 36:26.885
time to stop coddling
our enemies

36:26.918 --> 36:29.821
and offering our friends
empty promises.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.491
Which is why
I will shortly introduce

36:32.524 --> 36:34.993
new legislation
to defeat the mutants

36:35.026 --> 36:37.929
who are trying to destroy
our way of life.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.006
Okay, the second
the speech is over,

36:48.039 --> 36:50.008
I'll knock out the frequencies
for phones and walkies.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.677
ESME:
You're gonna need to hurry.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.011
Once communication goes down
in this place,

36:53.044 --> 36:54.680
it's gonna be crawling
with security.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.848
We can only keep them away
from the cars for so long.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.851
We will not be staying
any longer than we have to.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.420
Believe me.

37:01.453 --> 37:04.856
This bill will help fund
next-generation programs

37:04.890 --> 37:07.693
to wipe out our enemies
wherever they hide,

37:07.726 --> 37:09.561
whatever their powers,

37:09.595 --> 37:12.197
because we are done
being afraid.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.733
We are done living under siege.

37:14.766 --> 37:17.536
It is time
for humanity to prevail.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.572
-Yeah.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.579
-All right, we got to
make this quick. -Hey.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.781
I can get us past the guards,
onto that balcony.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.583
From there, you can take us
to the elevators, right?

37:31.617 --> 37:35.754
Yeah, yeah, but I want
to say something first.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.823
What you did earlier,
when you stopped the Frosts

37:37.856 --> 37:42.127
from torturing that guy,
that was the right thing to do.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.996
Okay, I think maybe
I was too hard on you earlier.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.466
No, you weren't. I should have
been more honest about my past.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.734
It doesn't matter,
doesn't matter.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.802
What matters is who you are now.

37:53.339 --> 37:56.842
That you're one of us.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.522
Now, that felt real.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.026
Let's do this.

38:18.229 --> 38:20.699
*

38:37.483 --> 38:39.618
You're lucky you made it
to your mother's when you did.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.119
They sent another team
to her house.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.622
But you think she made it out
of town without them noticing?

38:43.655 --> 38:45.491
-So far.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.225
Trask is not just after her.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.695
Everyone who has ever met Otto
is getting a visit.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.797
Well, hopefully
we're a step ahead of them.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.065
-Did you get any leads
from your mother? -Maybe.

38:54.099 --> 38:57.969
A researcher that my dad
worked with-- Madeline Risman.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.205
It sounds like
someone we should find.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.207
Right.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.047
Okay, stop.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.249
What happened
in that parking lot?

39:11.282 --> 39:14.686
We came outside,
you were both on the ground,

39:14.720 --> 39:16.522
and you haven't been
speaking to each other.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.156
Just a disagreement. Right?

39:18.189 --> 39:21.159
A disagreement?
You attacked those agents.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.161
They were gonna shoot us,
I stopped them, and we got away.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.064
-You almost killed that guy.
-Yeah, key word: "almost."

39:26.097 --> 39:27.733
CAITLIN: Guys, I don't know
what's going on,

39:27.766 --> 39:30.068
but we need to stick together
as a family right now.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.270
-Tell her that, not me.

39:32.303 --> 39:35.006
Last time I checked, I'm
the one person in this family

39:35.040 --> 39:38.243
who's actually proud
to be a von Strucker.

39:47.152 --> 39:51.189
Look, I know
it's frustrating, but...

39:51.222 --> 39:53.191
But what?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.793
This is just a phase?

39:54.826 --> 39:58.296
No. But he's your brother.
You can work it out.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.532
Mom...

40:00.566 --> 40:03.735
something has changed in Andy.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.305
He's not the same anymore.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.648
ESME: Senator Montez
is done with his speech.

40:16.682 --> 40:19.985
Your sisters finished
dumping Bennett?

40:31.597 --> 40:33.064
They're on their way back.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.267
Campbell should be
headed upstairs soon.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.010
They look so happy.

40:45.043 --> 40:48.780
Nothing brings people together
like hate.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.884
-Yeah.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.641
Such a neat trick.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.318
Lorna did her thing.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.320
It's time.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.900
You'll wait outside while I meet
the other politicians.

41:43.569 --> 41:46.572
He's coming up, with a few
guards in the elevator.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.106
Wait.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.215
Sounds like there's three more
in a suite down the hall.

41:57.248 --> 42:00.852
-Then let's stay the hell away
from that suite. -Come on.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.403
-Hey, Dr. Campbell.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.339
-GUARD: My eyes!

42:34.252 --> 42:35.854
Come on.

42:37.956 --> 42:40.792
-Children! We're under attack.

42:40.826 --> 42:42.260
We're under attack.
Just stay with me.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.129
We don't want anyone
to get hurt.

42:44.162 --> 42:47.232
Get back in the elevator.
Hurry!

42:48.900 --> 42:51.637
Get back in the elevator.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.338
Your move, Sunshine.

42:56.642 --> 42:58.476
-Behind you!
-Run!

43:00.646 --> 43:02.447
:
Get down!

43:12.157 --> 43:14.025
Clarice! Get us out of here!

43:33.444 --> 43:35.046
Come in.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.785
Lorna, you have a visitor.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.253
What you got there?

43:42.287 --> 43:45.123
It's just a gift I got
a long time ago.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.860
From someone my mom knew.

43:48.894 --> 43:50.461
That's nice.

43:50.495 --> 43:52.964
You can come in.

43:52.998 --> 43:55.000
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

43:55.033 --> 43:57.368
-Hello, Lorna.

43:57.402 --> 43:59.237
My name is Evangeline.

44:03.241 --> 44:06.111
Your situation was recently
brought to my attention.

44:06.144 --> 44:09.014
-I'm an attorney and...

44:09.047 --> 44:11.282
-Well, according to

44:11.316 --> 44:13.284
the court record,
you were involved

44:13.318 --> 44:15.620
in a Purifier counterprotest
that turned violent.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.789
You were given psychiatric care
as an alternative to jail.

44:17.823 --> 44:22.828
Well, yeah. The judge's sister
had bipolar disorder, too.

44:22.861 --> 44:25.496
-Lucky me.
-For now.

44:25.530 --> 44:29.067
If that judge knew how half
a dozen anti-mutant protestors

44:29.100 --> 44:30.736
"accidentally" fell off
an overpass,

44:30.769 --> 44:33.839
you'd be in a maximum security
facility somewhere.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.406
How do you know that?

44:35.440 --> 44:37.508
I know a lot about you,
Ms. Dane.

44:37.542 --> 44:40.345
Since 7/15, things are changing.

44:40.378 --> 44:42.680
A hard time is coming
for mutants.

44:42.714 --> 44:44.482
We need people like you.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.984
-Fighters.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.585
You've heard of the X

44:47.618 --> 44:50.655
Yeah.
Aren't they an urban legend now?

44:50.688 --> 44:52.657
World went to hell and, poof,

44:52.690 --> 44:55.093
-they're gone. -Well,
they left something behind.

44:55.126 --> 44:57.228
A network to help mutants
in trouble.

44:57.262 --> 44:59.664
-It needs leaders.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.166
I think someone screwed up.

45:01.199 --> 45:04.002
You do realize this is
a mental hospital, right?

45:04.035 --> 45:05.837
EVANGELINE:
Mm.

45:05.871 --> 45:08.840
Well, maybe they see something
in you that you don't.

45:13.879 --> 45:15.346
You think you're the only one

45:15.380 --> 45:17.582
with demons inside you,
Ms. Dane?

45:19.484 --> 45:21.753
We all have them.

45:21.787 --> 45:25.223
It's what you do with them
that matters.

45:37.903 --> 45:40.872
Where are they?

45:40.906 --> 45:42.473
There's security everywhere
already.

45:42.507 --> 45:45.376
-They're going to find us.
-They'll be here.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.212
-If they failed, I...

45:47.245 --> 45:49.647
There. There they are.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.656
Wh
Where the hell is Campbell?!

45:58.689 --> 46:00.291
We couldn't get to him.

46:00.325 --> 46:02.227
-He shielded himself with
a bunch of kids.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.830
-So, kids. -Do you know how many
people are gonna die if the

46:04.863 --> 46:07.132
Hound program continues? We are
not leaving here without him!

46:07.165 --> 46:09.167
-They're coming. We have to go.
-No! We can't.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.502
-They're coming! We have to go!
-Damn it.

46:19.811 --> 46:22.247
Suspects spotted. They're
fleeing in two black SUVs.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.315
-DISPATCHER: Attention
all units.

46:24.349 --> 46:26.985
Suspects are headed west
on Route 5 through Charlotte.

46:27.018 --> 46:28.453
Two cars in pursuit.

46:48.406 --> 46:50.375
MONTEZ:
There was a mutant attack here?

46:50.408 --> 46:53.111
The threat has been neutralized,
Senator Montez.

46:53.144 --> 46:55.113
-Well, it's my understanding

46:55.146 --> 46:57.282
they're being pursued
as we speak.

46:57.315 --> 46:59.217
The rest of the conference
events will be canceled,

46:59.250 --> 47:01.319
-I'm sure, but we should go
to the airport.

47:01.352 --> 47:02.954
You still want
to move forward with this?

47:02.988 --> 47:04.890
Absolutely. This is exactly
the time to move forward.

47:04.923 --> 47:07.993
This just shows how seriously
the enemy takes us.

47:08.026 --> 47:12.063
This is our moment, Senator.
Now is the time to strike.

47:12.097 --> 47:14.232
*

47:21.372 --> 47:23.074
SAGE:
Something went wrong.

47:23.108 --> 47:25.510
I wish I could tell you more,
but for now,

47:25.543 --> 47:27.745
all we know is what we've
learned from the police reports.

47:27.778 --> 47:30.148
-No, he got away.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.283
Well, keep us posted.

47:33.518 --> 47:35.086
REED:
Guys, we got some bad news.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.088
Not a lot of details,
but it looks like

47:37.122 --> 47:38.589
things didn't go well
in Charlotte.

47:38.623 --> 47:41.326
Dr. Campbell got away.
They had to run.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.094
Well, we should go out
and back them up.

47:43.128 --> 47:44.662
LAUREN:
They're two states away.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.832
By the time we get there,
it'll be too late.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.167
REED:
Lauren's right.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.669
They're on their own for now.

47:51.702 --> 47:55.006
-So are we. -No, maybe
we can help. You don't know.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.542
There are people to protect
here. When the X-Men founded

47:57.575 --> 47:59.510
this place, they didn't say "run
off whenever you're pissed."

47:59.544 --> 48:01.179
Our friends might not be
coming back.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.214
-Of course I am.

48:03.248 --> 48:05.016
-But we've got a job here.
-REED: Guys.

48:05.050 --> 48:06.851
-We can't keep fighting each
other. -Your father's right.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.619
We have to be strong
as a family.

48:08.653 --> 48:11.289
I'm the one who wants us
to be strong!

48:11.322 --> 48:13.358
You mean you want us to be
the von Struckers again.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.293
You sound like
the Frost sisters.

48:15.326 --> 48:17.195
What's wrong with that?
They're willing to face reality.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.097
I mean, the humans
are coming after us.

48:19.130 --> 48:20.698
The humans, Andy?

48:20.731 --> 48:23.268
Am I coming after you?
Is your mom?

48:26.137 --> 48:28.706
I didn't...

48:28.739 --> 48:30.641
You know what I meant.

48:45.423 --> 48:46.924
What's the story?

48:46.958 --> 48:49.660
The boy, Andrew Strucker,
attacked the agents here.

48:49.694 --> 48:51.662
Family fled
before backup could arrive.

48:51.696 --> 48:54.265
Well, maybe they didn't get
away as clean as they thought.

48:54.299 --> 48:55.733
NOVAK:
Sir?

48:55.766 --> 48:58.636
JACE: Dr. Campbell sent us
a new pair of Hounds.

48:58.669 --> 49:00.338
One's clairvoyant,
the other one detects

49:00.371 --> 49:02.407
organic molecules;
turns out, together they're

49:02.440 --> 49:03.908
pretty damn good
at finding people.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.643
Let's go.

49:07.712 --> 49:09.847
Right over here.

49:11.282 --> 49:13.851
Family came through
about an hour ago.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.202
You got something?

49:31.236 --> 49:34.339
Good. Let's go get 'em.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.463
How could you just let Campbell
get away like that?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.465
Uh, we didn't let him do
anything. What the hell are we

50:00.498 --> 50:02.033
-supposed to do, attack
a bunch of little kids? -Oh.

50:02.067 --> 50:04.302
You're worried about their kids?
Worry about your own!

50:04.335 --> 50:06.171
-No, he is on his way to D.C.

50:06.204 --> 50:07.505
with a Senator in his pocket
right now.

50:07.538 --> 50:09.307
-After today... -We just
gave them a hell of an excuse

50:09.340 --> 50:10.875
-to expand the Hound program.
-I'm sorry.

50:10.908 --> 50:13.010
-Yes, this is your fault.

50:13.044 --> 50:15.246
What we need to figure out
is where Campbell is,

50:15.280 --> 50:17.415
so we can finish
what we started.

50:24.355 --> 50:25.990
ECLIPSE:
I love you.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.024
POLARIS:
I love you.

50:28.859 --> 50:31.162
POLARIS: How are we supposed to
raise a baby?

50:31.196 --> 50:32.930
We can barely
protect ourselves.

50:34.899 --> 50:37.768
The Frost sisters are checking
all the airports in the area,

50:37.802 --> 50:39.504
but Campbell's gonna
be ready now.

50:39.537 --> 50:40.905
We're looking at
a full-on assault.

50:40.938 --> 50:42.773
Babe, maybe we should
get out while we can.

50:42.807 --> 50:44.575
Look for another chance
on our own terms.

50:44.609 --> 50:46.377
And if there isn't
another chance?

50:46.411 --> 50:48.446
-That conference.

50:48.479 --> 50:50.115
I've never seen
anything like it.

50:50.148 --> 50:53.184
All those people
focused on hating us.

50:53.218 --> 50:55.186
Smiling.

50:55.220 --> 50:58.356
Running in and attacking people
won't stop them from hating us.

50:58.389 --> 51:01.559
-It'll only make things worse.
-We have to do something.

51:03.394 --> 51:07.098
Look... I'm worried about you.

51:07.132 --> 51:10.268
The way that you tore down
that telephone pole.

51:10.301 --> 51:12.103
You haven't been sleeping
at all.

51:12.137 --> 51:13.304
Do you think
that you might be...

51:13.338 --> 51:15.039
Having a manic episode? No.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.542
This is not about
my mental illness, Marcos.

51:17.575 --> 51:20.745
This is about theirs--
those people at the conference,

51:20.778 --> 51:22.980
the people
all over this country.

51:30.588 --> 51:33.591
I thought if we had a child

51:33.624 --> 51:35.593
that it would have it
easier than we did.

51:35.626 --> 51:37.662
That we would build
a better world

51:37.695 --> 51:39.597
where our kid
wouldn't have to hide.

51:39.630 --> 51:42.300
We are building a better world.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.402
It's just taking some time.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.704
We have to have faith.

51:52.510 --> 51:56.080
I always love that about you...

51:56.113 --> 51:58.349
that you have faith.

52:12.563 --> 52:15.032
-Grabbing my stuff.

52:15.065 --> 52:17.034
I'm gonna go crash
with Naya and Skyler.

52:17.067 --> 52:19.804
-It's just upstairs.

52:19.837 --> 52:21.872
CAITLIN:
I know you were upset earlier,

52:24.642 --> 52:27.445
A month ago, I had a bedroom
with an actual door,

52:27.478 --> 52:29.880
where I could have
some space if I wanted.

52:29.914 --> 52:32.483
-Please. Space.

52:36.821 --> 52:39.657
Probably just wants
some independence.

52:55.673 --> 52:58.476
Yo, uh, is it cool
if I crash here?

52:58.509 --> 52:59.944
Knock yourself out.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.886
You guys heard about
Dr. Campbell, right?

53:08.919 --> 53:12.156
Yeah. Crazy.
They say what happens now?

53:12.189 --> 53:15.393
No. It's nothing good.

53:15.426 --> 53:18.062
-Scary stuff.
-Yeah.

53:18.095 --> 53:20.531
I mean, this is what Polaris
is training us for.

53:20.565 --> 53:22.233
It's times like this.

53:22.267 --> 53:25.102
I wish she was here right now.

53:27.204 --> 53:28.706
Hey.

53:31.276 --> 53:34.612
Look, I know you're
going through a lot right now.

53:34.645 --> 53:36.614
What happened at that lab
affected me, too.

53:36.647 --> 53:38.716
Affected you how?

53:38.749 --> 53:40.618
I mean, you've acted
like nothing's changed.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.787
That day
changed everything for me.

53:42.820 --> 53:47.124
All of those people dying--
I can't get it out of my head.

53:49.494 --> 53:51.729
But we have to focus
on making things better.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.964
We rescued Dad and Lorna.

53:53.998 --> 53:57.034
We helped save Trader
when he was shot.

53:57.067 --> 53:59.770
-Yeah, of course it did.

53:59.804 --> 54:01.539
But we're not little kids
playing X-Men anymore.

54:01.572 --> 54:03.974
This is real. There are
people trying to hurt us.

54:04.008 --> 54:06.711
And we have the power
to stop them.

54:06.744 --> 54:09.213
You mean the power
to destroy them.

54:09.246 --> 54:12.583
You're the one
who denied your abilities

54:12.617 --> 54:14.585
and almost destroyed
the whole family.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.623
Why would you want
to do that again?

54:27.264 --> 54:29.567
JACE:
Director Wolcott.

54:29.600 --> 54:32.002
I know you wanted an update
on our operations.

54:32.036 --> 54:34.004
We're following up
on an attack in Atlanta now.

54:34.038 --> 54:36.073
Making some good progress.
It appears to be

54:36.106 --> 54:37.908
-related to the Underground.
-Well, stay on it.

54:37.942 --> 54:40.077
The Humanity Today summit
just got hit.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.579
What, by mutants?

54:41.612 --> 54:43.414
Who else? Dr. Campbell's
working on getting

54:43.448 --> 54:46.083
political support in D.C.
for expanding the Hound program.

54:46.116 --> 54:49.086
-We need a win here, Turner.
-I won't let you down, sir.

54:49.119 --> 54:51.356
I had the Hounds check the car
and the road.

54:51.389 --> 54:54.291
-Two trails. One with Grandma

54:54.325 --> 54:56.026
headed to the highway;
the other one follows

54:56.060 --> 54:57.962
the rest of the Struckers
to the city outskirts.

54:57.995 --> 55:00.431
All right, alert the
local police about Grandma.

55:00.465 --> 55:02.700
We're following the family
to the Underground headquarters.

55:02.733 --> 55:04.268
-Yes, sir.
-We're moving out!

55:04.301 --> 55:06.504
You two, get in.

55:10.207 --> 55:13.210
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

55:13.243 --> 55:16.113
Your friends, your boyfriend--

55:16.146 --> 55:18.282
they're not seeing
this situation for what it is.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.518
Look, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

55:20.551 --> 55:22.119
Yes, you do.

55:22.152 --> 55:26.156
Campbell has to be eliminated,
one way or the other.

55:28.025 --> 55:30.861
Someone has to make
some hard choices here.

55:30.895 --> 55:32.863
And why are you so sure
that's me?

55:32.897 --> 55:35.132
Because whether you like it
or not, you're like your father.

55:35.165 --> 55:38.168
Ugh, this again.
Look, I have nothing to do with

55:38.202 --> 55:41.472
the guy you think is my father
or the Brotherhood.

55:41.506 --> 55:43.974
And I really don't care what
rumors you choose to believe.

55:44.008 --> 55:46.477
Not what I believe.
What you believe.

55:46.511 --> 55:48.513
Lorna, I'm a telepath.

55:48.546 --> 55:50.147
I know that he gave you
that medallion

55:50.180 --> 55:52.182
for your 13th birthday.

55:52.216 --> 55:54.018
All he ever wanted

55:54.051 --> 55:56.821
was for you to be proud
of who you are.

55:56.854 --> 56:00.925
You know what has to be
done here... don't you?

56:14.439 --> 56:15.873
What's wrong?

56:15.906 --> 56:17.742
-Not exactly, sir.

56:17.775 --> 56:18.843
Hounds are indicating

56:18.876 --> 56:20.344
the trail heads off
into the woods up there.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.379
Okay. And?

56:22.413 --> 56:24.882
Well, sir, that area's a
toxic waste contamination site.

56:24.915 --> 56:27.151
Whole area's off-limits.

56:29.554 --> 56:32.022
Son of a bitch.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.925
It's not off-limits anymore.

56:34.959 --> 56:37.261
-Tell the team we're moving in.
-But, sir, they said

56:37.294 --> 56:39.096
-a lot of people got sick
up here.

56:39.129 --> 56:40.798
'Cause the mutants seem
to be doing just fine.

56:40.831 --> 56:42.700
The humans they're
running around with, too.

56:44.935 --> 56:47.204
-WOLCOTT: Wolcott.
-Sir, it's Agent Turner.

56:47.237 --> 56:49.239
-I think we've got a bead

56:49.273 --> 56:51.576
-on the Mutant Underground
headquarters. -Very good.

56:51.609 --> 56:53.143
Take a run at them
with the SWAT team

56:53.177 --> 56:55.379
-for the lawyers.

56:55.412 --> 56:58.148
You still have that assault team
we used at Fairburn, correct?

56:58.182 --> 57:01.385
-Yes, sir. -Use whatever force
you deem necessary, Turner.

57:01.418 --> 57:02.753
Get it done.

57:15.099 --> 57:17.602
All right, everyone,
I just spoke to the director.

57:17.635 --> 57:19.236
We're going in. I...

57:26.443 --> 57:27.578
Something's wrong, sir.

57:27.612 --> 57:29.747
I think you're making a mistake.
The-the contamination...

57:29.780 --> 57:31.516
I-I don't, uh...

57:31.549 --> 57:33.518
-No.

57:33.551 --> 57:35.152
No. No.

57:35.185 --> 57:36.587
This is it, damn it.

57:36.621 --> 57:37.955
The Hounds aren't wrong.
This is it.

57:37.988 --> 57:39.757
-But, sir, I think...
-Listen to me.

57:39.790 --> 57:42.927
My worst fears
have already come true twice.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.362
We are not backing down.

57:47.197 --> 57:49.033
Whatever you're feeling
right now,

57:49.066 --> 57:50.701
you're gonna fight through it!

57:50.735 --> 57:52.870
We're going in.

57:57.207 --> 57:58.609
Sentinel Services!

57:58.643 --> 58:01.111
: They're coming!
They're coming now!

58:01.145 --> 58:03.981
Everybody, listen up!
This is not a drill!

58:04.014 --> 58:06.116
We're evacuating
right the hell now,

58:06.150 --> 58:08.118
so drop whatever you're doing
and move!

58:08.152 --> 58:09.854
-Sentinel Services is coming.

58:09.887 --> 58:11.789
We got to get
as many people in vans

58:11.822 --> 58:13.658
-and out of here as we can.
-Get the kids.

58:13.691 --> 58:15.726
-Yeah.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.828
-Go find your brother.

58:17.862 --> 58:20.698
You. I need you to help me
get the little ones out.

58:20.731 --> 58:21.966
You'll drive the first van.

58:21.999 --> 58:23.968
-Hide them.

58:24.001 --> 58:25.870
Don't start that crap with me.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.672
Hate me all you want
once everyone's safe,

58:27.705 --> 58:29.306
but right now you will move.

58:29.339 --> 58:33.043
I need all hard drives,
all communication devices!

58:52.863 --> 58:54.699
-Andy!
-Hey.

58:54.732 --> 58:56.400
-Sentinel Services.

58:56.433 --> 58:57.668
-They're coming.

58:57.702 --> 59:00.037
They're attacking our home.
Are we gonna fight?

59:00.070 --> 59:02.406
We will do whatever we have
to do to protect these people.

59:02.439 --> 59:03.373
That is our job.

59:09.546 --> 59:12.249
-Can't get ahold of anyone
at HQ? -It rang a few times,

59:12.282 --> 59:14.084
then cut out; and then when
I just called back, nothing.

59:14.118 --> 59:16.253
John. I can't find Lorna.

59:16.286 --> 59:18.789
What do you mean, you can't
find her? She was just here.

59:18.823 --> 59:21.225
And now she's not.
I looked everywhere.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.368
You're right.

59:31.401 --> 59:34.104
And she's not
the only one missing.

59:36.273 --> 59:37.775
Hey.

59:41.612 --> 59:43.614
Yeah, something's wrong.
We can't find Lorna.

59:43.648 --> 59:44.882
She left with your sisters.

59:44.915 --> 59:45.950
They're doing what you couldn't.

59:45.983 --> 59:47.885
Campbell and Montez
filed a flight plan.

59:47.918 --> 59:50.287
They fly out of Morrison
Air Center in 20 minutes.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.656
The most important thing
is to make sure

59:51.689 --> 59:54.224
-he doesn't get to D.C. Ever.
-BLINK: Whoa.

59:54.258 --> 59:55.660
It's an assassination now?

59:55.693 --> 59:57.427
Look, I hate
that son of a bitch...

59:57.461 --> 59:58.495
-John. -...but that
goes against everything

59:58.528 --> 1:00:00.597
-we stand for! No!
-Please. John, please.

1:00:00.631 --> 1:00:02.566
If we start killing,
it's gonna make life worse

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:03.668
for mutants everywhere.

1:00:03.701 --> 1:00:05.169
John, life is already worse
for mutants everywhere.

1:00:05.202 --> 1:00:07.471
-You know I'm right.
-Ah, shut up!

1:00:07.504 --> 1:00:09.807
-Marcos...
-Don't say another word!

1:00:10.975 --> 1:00:14.679
Now, we are gonna go get Lorna,
right now.

1:00:14.712 --> 1:00:16.747
And if I see your eyes
turn blue,

1:00:16.781 --> 1:00:20.918
I swear to God I will be
the last thing you see.

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:23.120
Let's go!

1:00:31.896 --> 1:00:34.598
It's noble, you wanting
to protect your friends

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:37.267
by keeping them out of this;
sooner or later they'll join us.

1:00:37.301 --> 1:00:39.937
-It's a matter of survival.
-It's not gonna happen.

1:00:39.970 --> 1:00:42.139
Mutant Underground's
everything to them.

1:00:42.172 --> 1:00:44.474
The Hellfire Club protected
mutants once, too, you know.

1:00:44.508 --> 1:00:46.343
That's why we're trying
to rebuild it.

1:00:46.376 --> 1:00:48.312
We know what you're thinking,
but you have to remember,

1:00:48.345 --> 1:00:51.115
-Marcos loves you.
-He'll come around.

1:00:51.148 --> 1:00:52.917
Stay out of my head.

1:00:56.353 --> 1:00:57.955
Kids.

1:00:57.988 --> 1:00:59.456
Let's go. All right.

1:01:01.658 --> 1:01:03.360
Come on, Zingo.
Here. Good boy.

1:01:03.393 --> 1:01:04.829
-All right.
-Sit in the back.

1:01:04.862 --> 1:01:06.296
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:08.498
You know where you're going?

1:01:08.532 --> 1:01:11.902
Yeah. Rally point's
Nashville station.

1:01:11.936 --> 1:01:15.505
We'll follow as soon as we can.

1:01:15.539 --> 1:01:17.541
Hey, good luck.

1:01:22.079 --> 1:01:23.213
REED:
They're here!

1:01:24.114 --> 1:01:27.684
Get out! Everyone inside!

1:01:27.718 --> 1:01:29.486
We need the other van.
There's still more people.

1:01:29.519 --> 1:01:32.322
-Get inside. It's too late.

1:01:32.356 --> 1:01:34.291
Let's go.

1:01:49.473 --> 1:01:52.176
That's great. Let's do another.

1:01:52.209 --> 1:01:54.411
Reed, we got to figure out
what to do.

1:01:54.444 --> 1:01:57.014
-Well, this should hold them off
for a little.

1:01:57.047 --> 1:01:58.248
We're trapped in here.

1:01:58.282 --> 1:02:00.350
Look, if these people
get caught,

1:02:00.384 --> 1:02:03.187
-they'll end up as Hounds.
-We have to get them out.

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:06.190
But they'll have teams
on all the exits.

1:02:06.223 --> 1:02:08.392
What if we made a new one?

1:02:08.425 --> 1:02:11.128
Maybe.

1:02:11.161 --> 1:02:12.696
How about the southeast corner?

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:14.698
The vault--
it's partially underground.

1:02:14.731 --> 1:02:16.767
They're not gonna have cover
on that side of the building.

1:02:16.801 --> 1:02:19.569
If we could get through there,
we might be able to get away.

1:02:19.603 --> 1:02:22.706
-I think we have to try.

1:02:22.739 --> 1:02:25.409
:
Okay.

1:02:29.246 --> 1:02:31.715
Everyone, listen to me.

1:02:33.918 --> 1:02:35.920
We're not gonna give up.

1:02:35.953 --> 1:02:37.888
We're gonna fight.

1:02:37.922 --> 1:02:39.824
And we're gonna
get out of here today.

1:02:39.857 --> 1:02:43.760
Now, I might not have
started out as one of you,

1:02:43.794 --> 1:02:45.662
but I am now.

1:02:45.695 --> 1:02:46.931
And I am telling you all,

1:02:46.964 --> 1:02:50.367
we have a chance
if we work together.

1:02:52.002 --> 1:02:54.604
If you've been in combat
training, we need you up here.

1:02:54.638 --> 1:02:57.074
Everyone else,
help down in the vault with me.

1:02:57.107 --> 1:02:59.076
We don't have much time!
Let's go!

1:03:00.377 --> 1:03:02.246
JACE :
This is Sentinel Services.

1:03:02.279 --> 1:03:04.982
We've surrounded the building.
Surrender immediately.

1:03:08.318 --> 1:03:10.287
I repeat,
we have you surrounded.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:12.656
Surrender immediately.

1:03:12.689 --> 1:03:15.459
Everyone, grab what you can!
Clear a path!

1:03:28.472 --> 1:03:30.540
CAITLIN:
You guys, come take this.

1:03:30.574 --> 1:03:32.442
-Go.

1:03:32.476 --> 1:03:34.678
Straight back in the other room.

1:03:37.314 --> 1:03:39.950
-Got another one!

1:03:39.984 --> 1:03:41.451
Go ahead.

1:03:41.485 --> 1:03:43.153
Okay.

1:03:47.057 --> 1:03:48.825
CAITLIN:
Okay.

1:03:48.859 --> 1:03:52.529
-I'll give it a shot.

1:03:58.402 --> 1:04:01.538
I can't get through.
Foundation's reinforced.

1:04:03.407 --> 1:04:04.741
Shatter!

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:09.813
Can you help us out here?

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:12.516
I got this.

1:04:24.528 --> 1:04:26.530
Try again.

1:04:26.563 --> 1:04:28.132
All right.

1:04:32.036 --> 1:04:34.704
That's good. Just keep going.

1:04:37.041 --> 1:04:39.376
Everybody, come help!

1:04:44.381 --> 1:04:46.216
Pedro spotted them
coming from the road,

1:04:46.250 --> 1:04:48.218
which means they're gonna focus
on the front.

1:04:48.252 --> 1:04:50.020
So our job is
to stop them there.

1:04:50.054 --> 1:04:52.389
-All we have
to do is hold them back

1:04:52.422 --> 1:04:54.558
long enough until the others
get us out of here.

1:04:54.591 --> 1:04:56.893
-There's no way.
-Skyler, it's gonna be okay.

1:04:56.927 --> 1:04:59.263
It's gonna be okay
if we stand up and fight.

1:04:59.296 --> 1:05:00.797
We got to remember
what Polaris told us.

1:05:00.830 --> 1:05:02.899
We stick together,
we watch each other's backs,

1:05:02.933 --> 1:05:04.134
and we got this.

1:05:04.168 --> 1:05:06.370
Naya, Skyler,
you take the right.

1:05:06.403 --> 1:05:07.571
Raghav and Zion and you two,

1:05:07.604 --> 1:05:09.706
cover the back
in case they come around.

1:05:09.739 --> 1:05:13.743
Andy and Lauren...
can you two take that window?

1:05:13.777 --> 1:05:15.579
I'm down if she is.

1:05:18.848 --> 1:05:21.718
Remember, we're trying
to save this place,

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:23.720
not settle some score.

1:05:23.753 --> 1:05:27.591
I'll fight my fight,
you fight yours. Okay?

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:32.096
*

1:05:46.476 --> 1:05:48.778
JACE:
On my go.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:52.816
Move in.

1:06:04.194 --> 1:06:05.662
:
We all go at once.

1:06:05.695 --> 1:06:07.564
You ready?

1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:17.807
Come on.

1:06:20.844 --> 1:06:22.412
Wait for it.

1:06:25.549 --> 1:06:27.351
AGENT :
First team in position.

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:31.455
Hold, hold.

1:06:31.488 --> 1:06:32.889
AGENT:
Second team in position.

1:06:34.491 --> 1:06:36.760
-Advance!
-Now!

1:06:38.562 --> 1:06:39.863
Go!

1:06:42.832 --> 1:06:44.768
-Get 'em up!

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:49.573
We got gunshots
at the center window.

1:06:49.606 --> 1:06:52.342
-Mutants on the left and right.

1:07:01.518 --> 1:07:03.220
Damn it!

1:07:07.724 --> 1:07:10.160
Just keep going!

1:07:11.561 --> 1:07:13.897
Fall back!
All teams fall back now!

1:07:29.213 --> 1:07:30.714
Good job!

1:07:34.884 --> 1:07:36.586
Okay, stay sharp!

1:07:36.620 --> 1:07:38.388
ECLIPSE:
Damn it! I should've known.

1:07:38.422 --> 1:07:40.056
It's my fault.
I should've stopped her.

1:07:40.090 --> 1:07:41.291
Marcos, you couldn't have known.

1:07:41.325 --> 1:07:42.526
It's not like her to do this.

1:07:42.559 --> 1:07:44.027
It's not? John, ever since
we broke her out

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:45.629
of that convoy,
you know she's been different.

1:07:45.662 --> 1:07:48.098
-And with the baby...
-I know she's had issues

1:07:48.132 --> 1:07:49.299
in the past.
Do you think that

1:07:49.333 --> 1:07:50.467
-maybe this is...
-BLINK: No way.

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:51.868
I've had friends
who were bipolar.

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:54.138
Assassination plots
are not one of the symptoms.

1:07:54.171 --> 1:07:55.939
She's right.

1:07:55.972 --> 1:07:58.842
Lorna knows
exactly what she's doing.

1:08:03.147 --> 1:08:05.115
You sure you can do this?

1:08:05.149 --> 1:08:06.650
I'm sure.

1:08:06.683 --> 1:08:08.652
We're not just talking
about your powers.

1:08:08.685 --> 1:08:11.388
I know
what you're talking about.

1:08:11.421 --> 1:08:13.790
-Your friends are coming.
-Okay, go.

1:08:13.823 --> 1:08:16.526
They have to know
I'm not doing this for you.

1:08:20.597 --> 1:08:22.532
*

1:08:32.342 --> 1:08:33.910
CAMPBELL:
Senator,

1:08:33.943 --> 1:08:36.913
I am so pleased we're moving
forward on this matter.

1:08:36.946 --> 1:08:39.483
Well, as I see it,
getting mutant criminals

1:08:39.516 --> 1:08:41.751
off the street
has to be the priority.

1:08:41.785 --> 1:08:44.988
-We're saving lives.
-My feelings precisely.

1:08:45.021 --> 1:08:48.124
How did you get into all this?

1:08:48.158 --> 1:08:49.393
Thank you.

1:08:50.660 --> 1:08:53.430
My brother had cystic fibrosis.

1:08:53.463 --> 1:08:55.365
He suffered terribly.

1:08:55.399 --> 1:08:57.501
I saw firsthand
the horror of genetic disease.

1:08:57.534 --> 1:09:00.003
If it's just one person
or humanity itself,

1:09:00.036 --> 1:09:03.307
I feel it's my calling
to ease their suffering.

1:09:04.674 --> 1:09:06.710
I'll drink to that.

1:09:06.743 --> 1:09:08.678
Yes.

1:09:12.416 --> 1:09:14.384
Hounds are ready.

1:09:14.418 --> 1:09:16.019
JACE: Once they breach,
our squads will follow.

1:09:16.052 --> 1:09:17.887
If we're trying
to take prisoners...

1:09:17.921 --> 1:09:20.957
No, no, we're not taking
any prisoners. We're past that.

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:22.892
Our instructions are
to end this station.

1:09:22.926 --> 1:09:26.563
That's exactly what
we're gonna do. Move in!

1:09:28.398 --> 1:09:29.833
AGENT:
Move in.

1:09:29.866 --> 1:09:31.735
Let's go.

1:09:31.768 --> 1:09:33.036
Move.

1:09:46.883 --> 1:09:49.018
That's good.

1:09:49.052 --> 1:09:52.322
Just keep going. We got to get
it big enough to crawl through.

1:09:52.356 --> 1:09:55.459
I'll get the others.

1:10:03.367 --> 1:10:05.402
-Mom.
-Be careful.

1:10:05.435 --> 1:10:07.337
We're almost through.

1:10:09.205 --> 1:10:10.507
How's it going downstairs?

1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:12.509
We're close.
Just a few more minutes.

1:10:12.542 --> 1:10:13.777
Well, that may be more
than we have.

1:10:13.810 --> 1:10:15.078
We managed to hold off
the SWAT team,

1:10:15.111 --> 1:10:17.013
but it looks like
they're bringing in the...

1:10:18.882 --> 1:10:19.916
LAUREN:
The Hounds are back!

1:10:19.949 --> 1:10:22.786
You take this.
And same as before!

1:10:23.387 --> 1:10:24.588
Go!

1:10:32.496 --> 1:10:33.630
Get down!

1:10:40.270 --> 1:10:42.572
You okay?

1:10:42.606 --> 1:10:45.509
Go to the kids. I'll cover you.

1:10:51.581 --> 1:10:54.318
Everyone downstairs now!

1:10:54.351 --> 1:10:55.919
Come on!

1:11:02.792 --> 1:11:04.761
Come on.

1:11:12.001 --> 1:11:14.604
It's working.
They stopped resisting.

1:11:14.638 --> 1:11:16.139
We got 'em.

1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:25.148
They're getting in!

1:11:25.181 --> 1:11:26.950
The barrier's
not gonna hold for long!

1:11:32.856 --> 1:11:35.625
-We're through!

1:11:35.659 --> 1:11:38.194
Okay, when you get out,
go down the hill.

1:11:38.227 --> 1:11:39.996
Stay in the trees.

1:11:40.029 --> 1:11:41.765
If they see us,
they'll know where we went.

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:44.734
-They'll catch us out there.
-Mom, Dad.

1:11:46.035 --> 1:11:47.203
We can get everyone out.

1:11:47.236 --> 1:11:49.773
-If we destroy the building

1:11:49.806 --> 1:11:52.676
after getting everyone out,
then we can cover our tracks.

1:11:52.709 --> 1:11:55.144
-Everyone will be safe.
-Wait, wait.

1:11:55.178 --> 1:11:56.646
Y-You know what that means.

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:59.015
-Yeah, we know.

1:12:02.352 --> 1:12:04.554
They're coming!

1:12:04.588 --> 1:12:08.224
You did your part.
Let us do ours.

1:12:08.257 --> 1:12:09.693
This is not good-bye.

1:12:09.726 --> 1:12:13.062
-We will see you outside.
-Come on.

1:12:34.784 --> 1:12:36.986
JACE :
If you meet any resistance,

1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:39.055
end it.

1:12:55.972 --> 1:12:57.907
*

1:13:21.064 --> 1:13:22.966
*

1:13:40.850 --> 1:13:43.620
Everybody out!
Everybody out now!

1:13:43.653 --> 1:13:46.089
Fall back! Fall back!

1:13:48.458 --> 1:13:50.927
Go, go, go. Go.

1:14:05.108 --> 1:14:06.610
Lorna!

1:14:06.643 --> 1:14:09.178
Babe, we just want to talk.

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:12.081
There's nothing to talk about.

1:14:12.115 --> 1:14:13.750
This is just something
I have to do.

1:14:13.783 --> 1:14:15.985
-Please stand back.
-We can't do that.

1:14:24.561 --> 1:14:26.496
Whoa. Okay.

1:14:26.530 --> 1:14:28.598
You're my friend, Clarice,
but don't...

1:14:28.632 --> 1:14:30.366
don't try to get clever.

1:14:33.236 --> 1:14:35.438
MONTEZ:
And when we get to Washington,

1:14:35.471 --> 1:14:38.107
we'll have a narrow path
to push this through.

1:14:38.141 --> 1:14:40.143
There's still support
for so-called mutant rights

1:14:40.176 --> 1:14:41.277
in some states.

1:14:41.310 --> 1:14:43.780
That's why we came to you,
Senator.

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:45.448
And I assume
they'll remember my support

1:14:45.481 --> 1:14:47.483
during the next
presidential primary season?

1:14:47.517 --> 1:14:49.452
Yes, of course.

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:51.521
Listen, Lorna,
you don't want to do this.

1:14:51.555 --> 1:14:52.789
Marcos, I have to.

1:14:52.822 --> 1:14:55.124
-For all of us.
-No. No, you don't.

1:14:55.158 --> 1:14:58.461
You saw what happened when
innocent people died on 7/15.

1:14:58.494 --> 1:15:00.964
Not everyone on that plane
is trying to hurt us.

1:15:00.997 --> 1:15:04.367
Innocent people--
you take it down, they die!

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:06.202
There are innocent people
on this side, too.

1:15:06.235 --> 1:15:08.638
If I don't take it down,
they die.

1:15:08.672 --> 1:15:11.240
-You're wrong!
-You're not a killer, Lorna.

1:15:12.842 --> 1:15:14.911
This isn't why
the X-Men chose us.

1:15:14.944 --> 1:15:18.815
The X-Men made a mistake.
This is who I am.

1:15:18.848 --> 1:15:20.650
ECLIPSE:
Please, just listen to me.

1:15:20.684 --> 1:15:23.820
Now, we will figure this out.
I don't care about the X-Men.

1:15:23.853 --> 1:15:25.354
I don't care
about the Brotherhood.

1:15:25.388 --> 1:15:28.124
I care about my family.

1:15:32.195 --> 1:15:34.297
That's what I care about, too.

1:15:36.065 --> 1:15:39.068
But I'm tired of hiding.

1:15:41.404 --> 1:15:45.008
-We have to take a stand.
-Not like this.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:48.778
This changes everything.
This will change everything.

1:15:48.812 --> 1:15:52.949
Our kid has to live
in this world.

1:15:58.822 --> 1:16:01.290
It's time to make a new world.

1:16:04.227 --> 1:16:06.730
ECLIPSE:
No, Lorna, please.

1:16:06.763 --> 1:16:08.464
Lorna!

1:16:12.168 --> 1:16:14.804
-PILOT: This is your pilot.

1:16:14.838 --> 1:16:16.305
Please fasten your seat belts.

1:16:16.339 --> 1:16:18.441
We're experiencing
engine trouble.

1:16:23.412 --> 1:16:25.782
PILOT:
Prepare for emergency landing!

1:16:25.815 --> 1:16:27.216
-I repeat,

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:29.819
-prepare for emergency landing.

1:16:32.521 --> 1:16:33.890
Don't do it! No, no, no!

1:17:02.618 --> 1:17:06.022
ECLIPSE:
Lorna? Lorna!

1:17:19.302 --> 1:17:21.237
*

1:17:35.919 --> 1:17:39.789
It was close,
but we got everyone out.

1:17:39.823 --> 1:17:43.359
If it weren't for Lauren
and Andy, we would all be dead.

1:17:44.828 --> 1:17:48.131
-It's gone.

1:17:48.164 --> 1:17:51.801
Gone
It can't just be gone.

1:17:51.835 --> 1:17:53.402
I'm telling you, gone.

1:17:53.436 --> 1:17:57.173
It just... I-I've never seen
anything like it.

1:17:57.206 --> 1:17:59.843
No one got out
but the Strucker kids.

1:18:01.277 --> 1:18:03.012
You okay?

1:18:04.848 --> 1:18:06.750
Uh, just...

1:18:06.783 --> 1:18:09.518
we sacrificed so much.

1:18:18.261 --> 1:18:21.030
Uh... any, uh,
any word from Lorna?

1:18:22.932 --> 1:18:25.001
Nothing.

1:18:25.034 --> 1:18:26.870
I'm sorry.

1:18:36.579 --> 1:18:38.047
You all right?

1:18:40.083 --> 1:18:42.351
Just trying to wrap my head
around what happened.

1:18:42.385 --> 1:18:44.720
-It was them or us. We had to.
-I know that.

1:18:44.754 --> 1:18:46.355
They were mutants, too.

1:18:46.389 --> 1:18:49.392
They didn't choose to be there.
Campbell made them.

1:18:49.425 --> 1:18:53.429
We got out of that lab in time.
They didn't.

1:18:55.064 --> 1:18:56.399
Lauren...

1:18:58.067 --> 1:19:01.304
REED: Hey, guys.
I just want to say...

1:19:01.337 --> 1:19:05.141
what happened today was hard.

1:19:05.174 --> 1:19:09.245
But the fact is
you rescued all these people.

1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:13.249
You, too, Cait.

1:19:14.918 --> 1:19:17.553
I'm proud of our family.

1:19:17.586 --> 1:19:20.123
*

1:19:44.848 --> 1:19:47.483
WOLCOTT: We've reviewed
the operation, and so far,

1:19:47.516 --> 1:19:49.485
I'd have to say,
there are grave questions

1:19:49.518 --> 1:19:52.421
-about your judgment.

1:19:52.455 --> 1:19:55.124
You launched this assault
without proper backup.

1:19:56.359 --> 1:19:58.862
With all due respect,
I launched that assault

1:19:58.895 --> 1:20:00.329
on your instructions.

1:20:00.363 --> 1:20:03.766
My instructions were
to apprehend any terrorists

1:20:03.799 --> 1:20:05.601
in a way that secured

1:20:05.634 --> 1:20:07.971
the safety of our agents
and mutant assets.

1:20:08.004 --> 1:20:09.705
Is this a joke?

1:20:09.738 --> 1:20:13.109
We just got hit, and you're
looking for a scapegoat?

1:20:13.142 --> 1:20:14.310
It's hardly a scapegoat,

1:20:14.343 --> 1:20:16.045
and it's not just
the Mutant Underground.

1:20:16.079 --> 1:20:19.448
We lost a United States senator
at the hands

1:20:19.482 --> 1:20:21.717
of a mutant criminal
you failed to secure.

1:20:21.750 --> 1:20:24.720
Had you been more careful,
both of these tragedies

1:20:24.753 --> 1:20:26.322
-might have been averted!
!

1:20:26.355 --> 1:20:29.525
You're talking to me
about tragedy?!

1:20:29.558 --> 1:20:32.561
I sacrificed everything
for this agency.

1:20:32.595 --> 1:20:33.629
I suggest you calm down.

1:20:33.662 --> 1:20:35.131
Yeah, I don't need
your damn suggestions.

1:20:35.164 --> 1:20:37.633
While you...

1:20:37.666 --> 1:20:41.304
you cowards sit here
covering your asses,

1:20:41.337 --> 1:20:44.073
real people are dying out there.

1:20:44.107 --> 1:20:47.911
Our country-- our species--
is under attack.

1:20:47.944 --> 1:20:49.678
You want to play your little...

1:20:49.712 --> 1:20:52.348
little bureaucratic games?
You go right ahead.

1:20:54.183 --> 1:20:56.319
You can do it without me.

1:20:56.352 --> 1:20:58.988
I quit.

1:20:59.022 --> 1:21:02.158
WOLCOTT:
Agent Turner. Agent Turner!

1:21:05.895 --> 1:21:09.032
THUNDERBIRD: We need to start
thinking about next steps.

1:21:09.065 --> 1:21:11.034
With the headquarters gone,

1:21:11.067 --> 1:21:13.202
a lot of people
have nowhere to go.

1:21:13.236 --> 1:21:15.671
John, we know
what we need to do.

1:21:15.704 --> 1:21:19.008
-We need to rebuild.

1:21:19.042 --> 1:21:21.510
You heard Sage.
The place disintegrated.

1:21:21.544 --> 1:21:23.512
ECLIPSE:
Not about a building.

1:21:23.546 --> 1:21:26.215
It's about the network
and the people in it.

1:21:26.249 --> 1:21:28.384
Everything we have is gone.

1:21:28.417 --> 1:21:32.355
Restart from nothing?
It's not possible.

1:21:32.388 --> 1:21:34.457
Besides, anything that we build,

1:21:34.490 --> 1:21:36.092
they're just
gonna smash it again.

1:21:37.293 --> 1:21:38.727
CAITLIN:
No.

1:21:38.761 --> 1:21:41.597
That's not a reason to give up.
That's a reason to fight harder.

1:21:41.630 --> 1:21:43.866
Listen,
I get you trying to help,

1:21:43.899 --> 1:21:45.434
but you're not even a mutant.

1:21:45.468 --> 1:21:48.204
I am. And my children are.

1:21:48.237 --> 1:21:50.906
And the Underground
saved our lives.

1:21:50.940 --> 1:21:53.809
If the Sentinel Services
comes after another family,

1:21:53.842 --> 1:21:55.611
we owe it to them to be there.

1:21:55.644 --> 1:21:57.913
SAGE:
I'm sorry, but the fact is

1:21:57.947 --> 1:21:59.215
since your family came,

1:21:59.248 --> 1:22:02.218
half our stations
have been destroyed.

1:22:02.251 --> 1:22:03.586
CAITLIN:
You can't blame us for that.

1:22:03.619 --> 1:22:06.389
The Hound program was coming
one way or another.

1:22:08.791 --> 1:22:10.126
ECLIPSE:
Okay. Hey!

1:22:10.159 --> 1:22:13.096
The X-Men didn't do this 'cause
they thought it would be easy.

1:22:13.129 --> 1:22:14.497
They knew
it would be a struggle.

1:22:14.530 --> 1:22:16.732
They knew it would
take sacrifice.

1:22:16.765 --> 1:22:18.301
POLARIS:
There's nothing noble

1:22:18.334 --> 1:22:20.269
about struggle, Marcos.

1:22:20.303 --> 1:22:25.341
And sacrifice is just
a pretty name for losing.

1:22:27.476 --> 1:22:30.413
Lorna, what are you doing?

1:22:30.446 --> 1:22:33.349
I'm telling them the truth.

1:22:33.382 --> 1:22:34.850
The Mutant Underground is dying.

1:22:34.883 --> 1:22:37.253
That world
where we don't have to hide

1:22:37.286 --> 1:22:39.088
that we've always talked about?

1:22:39.122 --> 1:22:40.923
I want to build that.

1:22:40.956 --> 1:22:42.625
For all of us.

1:22:42.658 --> 1:22:44.360
For my baby.

1:22:44.393 --> 1:22:46.595
That baby is ours.

1:22:46.629 --> 1:22:48.731
And this is
where your family is.

1:22:50.633 --> 1:22:54.203
Lorna, you know I will do
anything for you, but...

1:22:54.237 --> 1:22:56.005
I can't help you do this.

1:22:56.039 --> 1:22:59.342
No one's asking for your help.

1:22:59.375 --> 1:23:03.979
The people we're here for--
they know who they are.

1:23:04.013 --> 1:23:05.748
What the hell does that mean?

1:23:07.316 --> 1:23:09.252
:
What?

1:23:10.886 --> 1:23:14.490
Fade? Fade.

1:23:15.691 --> 1:23:17.893
Sage.

1:23:17.926 --> 1:23:20.829
I'm sorry, John.

1:23:20.863 --> 1:23:24.367
They ended the Hound program.
This is just about survival.

1:23:25.434 --> 1:23:27.002
ECLIPSE:
Guys.

1:23:27.036 --> 1:23:28.404
You've got to be kidding me.

1:23:36.011 --> 1:23:37.913
No. No way.

1:23:37.946 --> 1:23:41.417
Andy, stay where you are.
You are not taking our son!

1:23:41.450 --> 1:23:44.520
They're not taking me.
It's my decision.

1:23:46.689 --> 1:23:48.491
This thing they're trying
to rebuild, the Hellfire Club,

1:23:48.524 --> 1:23:50.393
it's something that our family
was a part of.

1:23:50.426 --> 1:23:53.562
And you're the one who's always
talking about helping people.

1:23:53.596 --> 1:23:56.999
A war between humans and mutants
isn't helping anyone.

1:23:57.032 --> 1:23:59.535
I can't let you do this.

1:24:01.804 --> 1:24:03.706
I'm not asking.

1:24:03.739 --> 1:24:05.541
What?

1:24:06.742 --> 1:24:07.910
Andy.

1:24:07.943 --> 1:24:10.746
When we were kids playing X-Men,

1:24:10.779 --> 1:24:14.550
we did that...
because they were heroes.

1:24:14.583 --> 1:24:16.552
Because they saved everyone.

1:24:16.585 --> 1:24:19.422
Please. Don't leave me.

1:24:22.225 --> 1:24:24.793
The X-Men are gone.

1:24:25.828 --> 1:24:27.363
We're not little kids anymore.

1:24:27.396 --> 1:24:29.732
-Andy.
-Andy, no.

1:24:36.905 --> 1:24:38.974
I'm-I'm sorry.

1:24:39.007 --> 1:24:40.809
I didn't mean to do that.

1:24:40.843 --> 1:24:42.911
I love you guys,

1:24:42.945 --> 1:24:45.414
but you're my family;
I don't want to hurt you.

1:24:45.448 --> 1:24:48.484
Don't try to stop me.

1:24:52.955 --> 1:24:54.923
*

1:24:59.595 --> 1:25:01.330
No.

1:25:01.364 --> 1:25:02.931
No, no, no, don't. Don't.

Now here are a few more shows

1:26:08.997 --> 1:26:11.734
Every day we encounter people
who are having the worst day

1:26:13.769 --> 1:26:16.372
This is a family.

1:26:16.405 --> 1:26:18.341
We work side-by-side.

1:26:18.374 --> 1:26:20.543
-Hustle up.

1:26:20.576 --> 1:26:24.413

'cause I get to help people.
