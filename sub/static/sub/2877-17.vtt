00:02.157 --> 00:03.783
Previously on Friends:

00:03.950 --> 00:06.619
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

00:06.786 --> 00:11.499
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go, like, every few minutes.

00:13.126 --> 00:17.547
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

00:18.214 --> 00:20.675
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

00:20.842 --> 00:21.885
Oh, my God!

00:22.051 --> 00:24.012
If you think that I didn't say goodbye...

00:24.179 --> 00:27.599
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

00:27.765 --> 00:29.559
It's because you mean more to me.

00:30.018 --> 00:31.644
- Rash!
- What?

00:55.126 --> 00:57.253
- Hey.
- Ha, ha.

00:57.420 --> 01:00.673
Shh. Go back to sleep.
I have to go home.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.468
Oh, God. This was amazing.

01:05.345 --> 01:07.430
It really was.

01:08.056 --> 01:10.517
You've learned some new moves.

01:11.392 --> 01:15.897
Yeah, well, uh, this guy at work gave me
Sex for Dummies as a joke.

01:16.064 --> 01:17.565
- Ah.
- Who's laughing now?

01:17.732 --> 01:19.067
I am.

02:09.449 --> 02:13.288
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

02:14.664 --> 02:16.666
Okay. Good.

02:16.874 --> 02:18.376
Next time, can I say "breathe"?

02:18.543 --> 02:21.588
No. Last time, you said it like Dracula,
and it scared her.

02:23.506 --> 02:25.341
Can I get you anything?
Want more ice chips?

02:25.508 --> 02:28.511
- No, I'm okay.
- All right. I'll be right back.

02:29.929 --> 02:33.182
- Where you going?
- To use the bathroom.

02:33.391 --> 02:36.769
- You can't leave me alone with her.
- What?

02:36.936 --> 02:39.814
This is exactly
the kind of social situation...

02:39.981 --> 02:41.816
...that I am not comfortable with.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.154
What kind of social situation
are you comfortable with?

02:46.988 --> 02:50.617
It's just that we've never spent any time,
you know, alone together.

02:50.783 --> 02:54.787
You'll be fine. You won't,
but I'll be back in two minutes.

02:54.954 --> 02:56.122
Okay.

03:02.879 --> 03:07.675
So, uh, any plans for the summer?

03:09.427 --> 03:11.804
I don't know. Maybe church camp.

03:14.724 --> 03:16.434
Ha...

03:16.684 --> 03:19.187
May not want to mention this.

03:22.065 --> 03:24.359
So you ever wonder which is worse?

03:24.525 --> 03:28.655
You know, going through labor
or getting kicked in the nuts?

03:29.781 --> 03:32.867
- What?
- Oh, it's just interesting.

03:33.034 --> 03:37.747
You know, because no one will ever know
because no one can experience both.

03:41.459 --> 03:44.879
One of life's great
unanswerable questions.

03:46.756 --> 03:47.882
I mean, who knows?

03:48.049 --> 03:50.551
Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things.

03:54.389 --> 03:56.140
Like this.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.815
- Come in.
- Morning.

04:03.981 --> 04:05.733
- Hey.
- What's that?

04:05.900 --> 04:09.404
Oh, it's my housewarming present
for Monica and Chandler.

04:10.905 --> 04:12.824
- That's a baby chick and duck.
- Uh-huh.

04:12.990 --> 04:15.910
And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.

04:16.411 --> 04:19.163
- I did not see that coming.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

04:19.329 --> 04:22.250
They'll love it at that new house.
It has that big backyard.

04:22.417 --> 04:24.585
And when they're old,
they can go to that farm...

04:24.752 --> 04:27.630
...that Chandler took
the other chick and duck to.

04:28.589 --> 04:30.425
- Yes.
- Yeah.

04:30.591 --> 04:34.762
- It's a shame people can't visit there.
- That is the rule though.

04:38.266 --> 04:41.185
- Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
- What?

04:41.352 --> 04:44.856
Erica went into labor. Monica and
Chandler are at the hospital right now.

04:45.022 --> 04:47.942
- Oh, my God!
- I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.

04:48.109 --> 04:50.778
Phoebe, you were sure Ben
was gonna be a girl.

04:50.945 --> 04:53.156
Have you seen him throw a ball'?

04:55.867 --> 04:58.619
- Is Rachel here?
- Uh, I think she's still asleep.

04:58.786 --> 05:01.038
Hey, hey, hey. How did it go
with you guys last night?

05:01.205 --> 05:03.374
She seemed pretty pissed at you.

05:03.624 --> 05:06.627
We, uh...
You know, we worked things out.

05:07.795 --> 05:10.631
What's that smile?
Did something happen with you two?

05:10.798 --> 05:13.301
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.

05:13.468 --> 05:17.305
Uh, but I'm also not one to have sex
and shut up. We totally did it.

05:18.973 --> 05:20.391
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?

05:20.558 --> 05:23.478
- I know, it's pretty great.
- So, what does that mean?

05:23.644 --> 05:26.314
- Are you guys getting back together?
- Oh, I don't know.

05:26.481 --> 05:29.817
- We didn't really get to talk.
- But do you want to get back together?

05:29.984 --> 05:32.028
I don't know.

05:32.195 --> 05:35.823
It was incredible.
I mean, it just felt so right.

05:35.990 --> 05:41.120
When I was holding her,
I mean, I never wanted to let her go.

05:42.163 --> 05:44.207
Know what? Yeah, I do.
I want to be together.

05:44.499 --> 05:45.666
Yay!
- Shh!

05:45.917 --> 05:47.418
Yay!

05:48.419 --> 05:50.713
So is she still going to Paris?

05:50.880 --> 05:53.800
Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
I hope not.

05:53.966 --> 05:57.720
This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
You guys might get back together.

05:57.887 --> 06:01.015
Monica and Chandler get their baby.
There are chicks and ducks...

06:01.182 --> 06:03.017
...in the world again.

06:03.184 --> 06:06.312
Oh. I feel like I'm in a musical.

06:08.356 --> 06:11.818
When the sun comes up
Bright and beamin'

06:11.984 --> 06:13.027
And the moon comes

06:13.194 --> 06:15.905
- Morning.
- Guess you'll never know how it ends.

06:17.365 --> 06:18.866
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:19.033 --> 06:22.119
- Hi. How'd you sleep?
- Good. You?

06:22.370 --> 06:25.748
- Good.
- I'll bet you did.

06:26.958 --> 06:29.502
Uh, would you guys mind
giving us a minute?

06:29.669 --> 06:31.963
Sure. Yeah. Just keep an eye
on the chick and duck.

06:32.213 --> 06:34.131
Chick and the duck'? Didn't they die...?

06:34.298 --> 06:40.555
Dive. Yeah, they dove.
Headfirst into fun on the farm.

06:47.562 --> 06:48.938
O

06:51.107 --> 06:54.986
- Morning.
- You too.

06:55.152 --> 06:58.990
- Last night was just wonderful.
- Oh, it really was.

06:59.156 --> 07:01.325
I woke up today
with the biggest smile on my face.

07:01.492 --> 07:03.578
I know, me too. It was...

07:03.744 --> 07:07.498
You know, it was like one of those things
you think is never gonna happen.

07:07.665 --> 07:11.419
And then it does,
and it's everything you want it to be.

07:11.919 --> 07:14.171
I know. It was just...

07:16.465 --> 07:18.801
It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.

07:27.143 --> 07:30.146
- Just a little bit more, honey.
- Oh, man, this hurts!

07:30.313 --> 07:32.148
- Is it really that bad?
- Uh-huh.

07:32.315 --> 07:36.277
I think it's time to kick you in the nuts
and see which is worse.

07:38.362 --> 07:40.781
The baby's head is crowning.

07:40.948 --> 07:45.536
Oh, my God! That is the most beautiful
top of a head I have ever seen.

07:45.703 --> 07:50.082
- Chandler, you have to see this.
- I'm okay.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.210
You don't want to miss this.
This is the birth of your child.

07:53.419 --> 07:56.923
- It's the miracle of life.
- All right.

07:58.674 --> 08:02.303
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.

08:02.803 --> 08:05.139
Start pushing. Here we go.

08:05.306 --> 08:07.350
Here come the shoulders.

08:13.814 --> 08:16.233
It's a boy.

08:16.484 --> 08:19.153
- Is he okay?
- He's just fine.

08:19.362 --> 08:21.155
You did it.

08:21.322 --> 08:22.949
It's a baby.

08:23.115 --> 08:28.913
A beautiful little baby. And some other
stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.

08:30.831 --> 08:34.126
- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
- Okay.

08:37.837 --> 08:39.799
Well, that's spongy.

08:41.384 --> 08:43.260
Oh...

08:44.345 --> 08:46.222
Hey, handsome.

08:47.056 --> 08:52.269
I'll love you so much that no woman
is ever gonna be good enough for you.

08:54.355 --> 08:57.066
- We are so lucky.
- I know.

08:58.025 --> 09:00.403
He has your eyes.

09:01.946 --> 09:05.449
I mean, I know that's not possible,
but he does.

09:05.616 --> 09:08.536
- We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
- Okay.

09:10.371 --> 09:12.790
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

09:13.290 --> 09:17.044
- Thank you so much.
- I'm really happy for you guys.

09:17.503 --> 09:20.631
- How do you feel?
- I'm tired.

09:20.798 --> 09:25.594
You don't have that much time to relax.
The other one will be along in a minute.

09:30.766 --> 09:34.020
I'm sorry, who should be along
in a what, now?

09:35.813 --> 09:38.315
The next baby should be
along in a minute.

09:38.524 --> 09:41.235
We only ordered one.

09:42.153 --> 09:45.281
- You know it's twins, right?
- Oh, yeah.

09:45.448 --> 09:48.909
These are the faces
of two people in the know.

09:54.331 --> 09:58.461
I can't believe you didn't know its twins.
This has never happened before.

09:58.669 --> 10:02.423
Well, gosh. That makes me
feel so special and good.

10:02.590 --> 10:04.091
Did you know it was twins?

10:04.258 --> 10:06.802
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork
we got from the clinic.

10:07.219 --> 10:10.097
- Did anybody tell you?
- I don't think so.

10:10.264 --> 10:13.309
Although, they did mention something
about two heartbeats...

10:13.476 --> 10:15.519
...but I thought that was just mine
and the baby's.

10:15.686 --> 10:17.354
They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."

10:17.521 --> 10:20.941
And I thought, "Well, that's good,
because I'm having a baby."

10:22.234 --> 10:25.321
- This is unbelievable.
- Twins actually run in my family.

10:25.529 --> 10:27.239
Interesting.

10:28.282 --> 10:30.659
Can I see you for a second?

10:32.912 --> 10:35.331
- What do we do?
- What do you mean, "What do we do?"

10:35.498 --> 10:39.168
Twins!

10:39.543 --> 10:43.631
- Chandler, you're panicking.
- Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?

10:44.799 --> 10:48.969
What do you say we keep one and then
just have an option on the other one?

10:49.136 --> 10:51.764
- We can't split them up.
- Why not?

10:51.931 --> 10:54.100
We could give each of them
half a medallion.

10:54.266 --> 10:56.894
And then years later,
they'll find each other...

10:59.188 --> 11:03.901
...and be reunited. I mean,
that's a great day for everybody.

11:04.068 --> 11:07.154
Okay. What if the person who adopts
the other one is horrible?

11:07.363 --> 11:10.324
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?

11:10.533 --> 11:13.869
Yeah. Because I hear the king
is looking to adopt.

11:14.036 --> 11:17.081
Monica, we are not ready
to have two babies.

11:17.248 --> 11:20.668
That doesn't matter.
We have waited so long for this.

11:20.835 --> 11:24.046
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies.

11:24.213 --> 11:27.925
I don't care if the entire cast
of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.

11:29.802 --> 11:32.972
We are taking them home
because they are our children.

11:33.180 --> 11:36.267
Okay. Shh.

11:37.101 --> 11:38.352
- Okay!
- Okay!

11:38.519 --> 11:40.396
Okay.

11:40.938 --> 11:43.691
It looks like we're about ready
over here. Come on, Erica.

11:43.858 --> 11:45.943
Start pushing again now.

11:47.403 --> 11:51.031
- Here she comes.
- She? It's a girl?

11:51.240 --> 11:52.825
Yeah.

11:54.368 --> 11:56.245
Well, now we have one of each.

11:57.746 --> 12:00.499
And that's enough.

12:03.085 --> 12:06.672
And then she said it was the perfect way
to say goodbye.

12:07.047 --> 12:08.757
Oh, my God.

12:09.341 --> 12:10.384
What did you say?

12:10.551 --> 12:15.097
- Nothing. What do you say to that?
- Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel.

12:15.264 --> 12:17.725
- No way.
- Well, you can't just give up.

12:17.892 --> 12:20.186
Is that what a dinosaur would do?

12:21.687 --> 12:24.190
- What?
- I'm just trying to speak your language.

12:25.733 --> 12:28.819
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you
even wanna get back together.

12:28.986 --> 12:33.073
If she did, she might feel differently.
She might not even go.

12:33.407 --> 12:35.659
- You really think so?
- I'm telling you!

12:35.826 --> 12:40.456
Oh, okay, this is the part of the musical
where there'd be a good, convincing song.

12:40.623 --> 12:43.500
Don't take no for an answer

12:45.252 --> 12:47.504
Don't let love fly away

12:47.755 --> 12:51.300
- Hi.
- Can't a girl finish a song around here?

12:51.467 --> 12:54.261
- Hey.
- Hi. So I dropped Emma off at my mom's.

12:54.428 --> 12:56.347
- Okay.
- You're not taking her tonight?

12:56.555 --> 12:59.058
No, we decided that
I'd go ahead and set up first...

12:59.225 --> 13:01.310
...then my mom would bring Emma
to Paris on Sunday.

13:01.518 --> 13:03.812
Wow. Eight-hour flight with a baby.
Good luck, Mom.

13:03.979 --> 13:07.858
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mom
talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.

13:10.653 --> 13:14.823
All right. You know what? You're right.
I should at least tell her how I feel.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.201
- Ross. Wait, wait.
- What? What?

13:17.368 --> 13:19.036
Could you get me a muffin?

13:22.623 --> 13:25.000
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

13:25.167 --> 13:31.757
I know you're leaving tonight,
but I just have to tell you.

13:32.466 --> 13:33.634
I love you.

13:36.428 --> 13:39.765
Now, I don't know if that changes
your plans at all.

13:39.932 --> 13:44.395
But I thought you should know.

13:45.521 --> 13:47.690
Gunther.

13:49.608 --> 13:54.280
I love you too.
Probably not in the same way.

13:54.446 --> 13:59.702
But I do. And when I'm
in a café having coffee...

13:59.868 --> 14:03.372
...or I see a man with hair
brighter than the sun...

14:04.707 --> 14:06.875
...I'll think of you.

14:13.299 --> 14:15.718
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

14:18.971 --> 14:20.723
Oh, my God!

14:21.598 --> 14:23.934
Unbelievable.

14:24.101 --> 14:26.979
- Hey, you know what might help?
- I'm not getting you a muffin!

14:37.740 --> 14:40.701
Do you think they recognize
each other from in there?

14:40.868 --> 14:43.912
Maybe. Unless they're like people
who've lived in apartments...

14:44.079 --> 14:47.916
...next to each other for years, then one
day they're pushed through a vagina...

14:48.083 --> 14:49.877
...and they meet.

14:50.711 --> 14:53.005
We're going to take Erica
to Recovery now.

14:53.213 --> 14:55.341
There's something
that we wanted to tell you.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.846
We decided to name the girl baby Erica.

15:01.930 --> 15:04.308
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!

15:06.393 --> 15:08.645
Son of a gun, it is.

15:10.439 --> 15:13.233
Anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.

15:13.859 --> 15:19.073
I'm really glad I picked you guys.
You're gonna make great parents.

15:19.239 --> 15:21.283
Even Chandler.

15:23.827 --> 15:25.329
- Okay, well, bye.
- Bye.

15:25.496 --> 15:26.914
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

15:27.081 --> 15:29.541
Have fun at church camp.

15:35.339 --> 15:39.051
- Look at these little bunnies.
- I know.

15:39.510 --> 15:41.428
You ready to trade?

15:41.637 --> 15:44.390
_Qkay-
_Qkay-

15:44.598 --> 15:46.600
Okay. Let's see.

15:55.609 --> 15:58.153
- We could trade later.
- Yeah, I'm good.

16:01.573 --> 16:05.828
- Hey, what are you working on?
- A "welcome home" sign for the baby.

16:05.994 --> 16:08.831
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?

16:09.873 --> 16:12.084
No, I sat in the paint.

16:13.669 --> 16:16.130
- Hey.
- So did you talk to Rachel?

16:16.338 --> 16:19.341
- No. And I'm not going to.
- What?

16:19.508 --> 16:21.885
- Why not?
- She's just gonna shoot me down.

16:22.052 --> 16:25.097
You saw what happened with Gunther.
That did not look like fun.

16:25.305 --> 16:27.641
How can you compare
yourself to Gunther?

16:27.808 --> 16:30.436
I mean, sure, he's sexy
in a more obvious way.

16:32.938 --> 16:36.442
You have a relationship with her.
You slept together last night.

16:36.650 --> 16:40.487
Yeah, and she still wants to go.
It's pretty clear where she is.

16:40.821 --> 16:42.865
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I mean, sometimes...

16:43.073 --> 16:45.868
- Uh, Joe.
- Damn it!

16:46.076 --> 16:48.704
If I were gonna tell her,
I don't have to do it now.

16:48.871 --> 16:51.248
Okay? I'll be seeing her again.
We've got time.

16:51.415 --> 16:55.669
No, you don't. She's going to Paris!
She is going to meet somebody.

16:55.836 --> 17:01.341
Do you know how many hot guys there
are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.

17:04.178 --> 17:05.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:05.971 --> 17:08.473
- What do you have there?
- Oh, I made a little something.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.393
If I had more time to work on it,
it'd be better, but...

17:13.979 --> 17:17.566
- Oh, my God, you did that yourself?
- Honey, that's gorgeous.

17:17.733 --> 17:21.153
You know, the baby can't read, Mike.

17:22.154 --> 17:26.157
Hi. The car service just got here.
I can't believe they're not home yet!

17:26.366 --> 17:28.994
I have to catch my stupid plane.
I want to see the baby.

17:29.161 --> 17:32.706
Monica just called from the cab.
She said they should be here any minute.

17:32.873 --> 17:36.543
- Apparently, there's some big surprise.
- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?

17:36.710 --> 17:40.964
Because my friend Ethel's baby
was born with a teeny-tiny beard.

17:45.552 --> 17:49.556
- Welcome home.
- Oh, my God.

17:50.682 --> 17:53.435
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey.

17:53.685 --> 17:55.103
Hey.

17:58.065 --> 18:00.901
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?

18:05.739 --> 18:07.783
- Oh, my God!
- How did this...?

18:07.950 --> 18:10.953
Okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows you took two, right?

18:11.578 --> 18:15.082
- Yes. It's twins.
- Oh, my... They are so cute.

18:15.249 --> 18:20.754
- Now, what kinds are they?
- This is a boy. And that's a girl.

18:20.921 --> 18:22.464
Her name is Erica.

18:23.465 --> 18:26.301
Hey, that pregnant girl's name
was Erica.

18:26.552 --> 18:30.639
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't
get to spend more time together.

18:31.598 --> 18:33.976
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
after Dad.

18:34.142 --> 18:38.480
- He's gonna be so happy.
- Jack Bing. I love that.

18:38.689 --> 18:42.776
It sounds like a '40s newspaper guy.
You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.

18:42.943 --> 18:46.113
I'm gonna blow this story wide open."

18:49.616 --> 18:52.160
Oh, my gosh.

18:52.411 --> 18:55.289
- So beautiful.
- I want one.

18:55.455 --> 19:00.210
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.

19:01.503 --> 19:04.006
Seriously. I mean,
you want to make one of those?

19:04.172 --> 19:06.466
- One? How about a whole bunch?
- Really?

19:06.633 --> 19:11.847
Yeah. We can teach them to sing,
and we could be like the von Trapp family.

19:12.014 --> 19:15.142
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kind of dull.

19:16.518 --> 19:20.230
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now,
I'm gonna miss my plane.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.359
- I'm so glad you got to see the babies.
- Me too.

19:24.526 --> 19:29.114
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around
to watch you two attempt to handle this.

19:30.741 --> 19:34.620
All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye
to you guys again.

19:34.786 --> 19:37.581
- I love you all so much.
- Love you.

19:37.748 --> 19:39.374
- We love you.
- Call us when you get there.

19:39.666 --> 19:43.128
I will. Ross, come here.

19:46.048 --> 19:47.841
I just want you to know...

19:49.468 --> 19:51.511
...last night...

19:52.971 --> 19:55.182
...I'll never forget it.

19:55.932 --> 19:57.893
Neither will I.

20:06.151 --> 20:08.153
All right. Now I really have to go.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.822
Okay, au revoir.

20:10.989 --> 20:12.407
Ugh.

20:13.033 --> 20:15.661
They're gonna really hate me over there.

20:17.996 --> 20:20.624
So you just let her go?

20:21.208 --> 20:22.793
Yeah.

20:23.752 --> 20:26.588
- Hey, maybe that's for the best.
- Yeah?

20:26.797 --> 20:29.883
Yeah. You know, you just...
Look, you gotta...

20:30.050 --> 20:32.594
You gotta think about last night
the way she does.

20:32.803 --> 20:35.055
Okay? You know, maybe...

20:36.056 --> 20:40.018
Maybe sleeping together was
the perfect way to say goodbye.

20:40.185 --> 20:44.356
- But now she'll never know how he feels.
- Maybe that's okay, you know?

20:44.648 --> 20:46.775
Maybe it is better this way.

20:46.983 --> 20:51.071
I mean, now... Now you can move on.

20:51.321 --> 20:53.949
I mean, you've been trying to for so long.

20:54.157 --> 20:56.993
Maybe now that you're
on different continents...

20:57.160 --> 20:59.287
- Right?
- Yeah.

21:02.833 --> 21:06.253
Maybe now you can actually do it,
you know.

21:07.254 --> 21:09.673
You can finally get over her.

21:13.677 --> 21:15.929
Yeah, that's true.

21:17.180 --> 21:18.724
Except.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.645
- I don't want to get over her.
- What?

21:23.812 --> 21:26.815
- I don't. I want to be with her.
- Really?

21:27.023 --> 21:29.484
- Yeah. I'm going to go after her.
- Yeah, you are!

21:31.319 --> 21:34.114
Wait! Wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!

21:34.281 --> 21:36.283
- My coat.
- This is so cool!

21:36.450 --> 21:39.619
I have no idea what's going on,
but I am excited!

21:39.828 --> 21:42.330
- What do you think she's gonna say?
- I don't know.

21:42.497 --> 21:47.085
But even if she shoots me down,
at least I won't spend my life wondering...

21:47.252 --> 21:49.796
...what would have happened.
Where is my coat?

21:49.963 --> 21:54.259
You didn't bring one! My cab's
downstairs. I'll drive you to the airport.

21:54.426 --> 21:55.886
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

21:56.052 --> 21:57.637
Good luck!

22:08.398 --> 22:11.401
- There's no seat belts!
- That's okay. If we hit anything...

22:11.568 --> 22:16.656
...the engine will explode,
so it's better if you're thrown from the car.

22:16.823 --> 22:19.910
- All right, all right. Let's do this.
- Okay!

22:21.328 --> 22:22.913
- Hey!
- 80th and East End.

22:23.079 --> 22:26.458
- No. I don't take passengers.
- The law makes you accept any fare.

22:26.625 --> 22:28.668
You don't understand.
This cab isn't real.

22:28.919 --> 22:30.754
What's your medallion number?

22:30.921 --> 22:33.298
My medallion number is,
get out of the cab!

22:33.840 --> 22:36.092
- What?
- Get out of the cab!

22:42.599 --> 22:45.602
Oh, hey, can I give you guys
your housewarming gift now?

22:45.811 --> 22:48.814
- Now, that you can do.
- All right.

22:57.656 --> 23:01.952
Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?

23:03.495 --> 23:06.373
Don't hide from Mama!

23:14.673 --> 23:16.007
You can open your eyes now.

23:16.174 --> 23:18.468
- Are we off the bridge?
- Yes!

23:18.635 --> 23:24.224
- Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
- Yeah, she jumped right back up.

23:24.724 --> 23:28.645
- Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
- Do you want to get to Rachel in time?

23:28.895 --> 23:30.939
Yes, but I don't want
to die in your cab.

23:31.231 --> 23:34.734
You should have thought of that
before you got in!

23:35.151 --> 23:36.820
- Tollbooth.
- What?

23:37.028 --> 23:39.281
Toll booth!

23:39.447 --> 23:42.158
Four bucks. There are quarters
in the glove compartment.

23:44.452 --> 23:46.121
Hurry!

23:47.080 --> 23:48.498
Okay. Aah!

23:50.333 --> 23:52.586
Damn, that window's clean.

23:53.587 --> 23:56.089
Quack, quack. Tweet, tweet.
Quack, quack.

23:56.423 --> 23:58.633
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.

23:59.050 --> 24:03.597
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.
Tweet, tweet. Quack, tweet, quack.

24:04.472 --> 24:07.100
We were wondering
what was taking so long...

24:07.267 --> 24:10.562
...but now we understand.
You were doing this.

24:12.606 --> 24:15.775
Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but...

24:15.942 --> 24:20.280
For your housewarming gift,
I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.

24:20.697 --> 24:22.991
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?

24:23.158 --> 24:28.705
Oh, great. Just what you want for
a new house with infants. Bird feces!

24:28.872 --> 24:31.541
But they must've jumped off the table.
Now they're gone!

24:31.708 --> 24:33.293
Don't worry, we'll find them.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.378
- I'm gonna go check on the twins.
- All right.

24:36.796 --> 24:39.215
Oh, God! What did I just step on?

24:39.591 --> 24:42.302
- It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
- Oh.

24:42.469 --> 24:44.888
You stepped on my egg roll?

24:45.931 --> 24:49.100
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look
for Chinese food on the floor.

24:49.309 --> 24:50.936
Just put it on a plate and leave.

24:55.065 --> 24:58.652
- Okay. Let's find these birds.
- All right.

25:01.404 --> 25:04.407
Wait, wait. You hear that?

25:07.035 --> 25:11.206
- They're in the table!
- Well, that can't be good.

25:11.373 --> 25:13.375
- We gotta get them out of there!
- How?

25:13.583 --> 25:16.294
Maybe we can lure them out.
You know any birdcalls?

25:16.461 --> 25:19.130
Oh, tons. I'm quite the Woodsman.

25:20.340 --> 25:23.593
Well, maybe we can just
tip the table a little.

25:23.802 --> 25:26.596
Joey, wait! The ball!

25:42.654 --> 25:43.989
So, what do we do?

25:44.155 --> 25:46.116
Maybe we can open this up somehow.

25:46.282 --> 25:47.909
Okay.

25:49.577 --> 25:52.747
No. It's all glued together.

25:52.956 --> 25:55.959
Does that mean
we have to bust it open?

25:56.167 --> 25:59.921
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

26:00.088 --> 26:05.010
I know. it's... It's the foosball table.

26:06.761 --> 26:09.097
All right, you know what?
We don't have a choice.

26:09.264 --> 26:13.059
It's like I would have said in that
sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.

26:14.394 --> 26:17.564
Those are our men in there,
and we have to get them out...

26:18.273 --> 26:21.735
...even if I have to sacrifice
the most important thing in my life...

26:21.901 --> 26:23.903
...my time machine.

26:25.447 --> 26:28.366
- Did that movie ever get made?
- It did not.

26:32.537 --> 26:35.331
Jack Weinberg,
white courtesy phone. Jack Weinberg.

26:35.498 --> 26:37.834
- Ross, where are you going?
- Uh, to talk to Rachel.

26:38.001 --> 26:40.670
Isn't that why we took a ride
in the death cab?

26:40.879 --> 26:42.672
You're walking up to her at the gate?

26:42.839 --> 26:45.508
Have you never chased anyone
through the airport before?

26:45.717 --> 26:48.011
Not since my cop show got canceled.

26:49.095 --> 26:51.514
You have to get a ticket
to get past security.

26:51.723 --> 26:55.685
- What? We're never gonna make it.
- Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!

26:58.104 --> 27:02.400
Okay, if you could all walk slower,
that'd be great.

27:09.074 --> 27:12.452
- Madame, your passport, please.
- Oh, my God.

27:12.619 --> 27:15.330
I was afraid I wouldn't remember
any of my high school French.

27:15.497 --> 27:18.333
But I understood every word
you just said.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.337
- Your boarding pass, please.
- Oh, sure.

27:23.004 --> 27:24.297
Oh...

27:24.589 --> 27:28.134
Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.

27:28.510 --> 27:31.304
- Madame, if you don't have your...
- I have it, I have it!

27:32.430 --> 27:33.473
Oh...

27:33.640 --> 27:38.812
Okay, I can't find it, but I remember
that I was in seat 32C...

27:38.978 --> 27:41.648
...because that's my bra size.

27:42.482 --> 27:44.192
You must have your boarding pass...

27:44.400 --> 27:47.821
You know what? If I was in 36D,
we would not be having this problem.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.081
- Hi. I need a ticket.
- Just one?

27:58.289 --> 28:01.084
I drive you here, and I don't get
to see how it works out?

28:01.292 --> 28:05.755
- Fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets.
- We're on our honeymoon.

28:07.215 --> 28:10.468
- And the destination?
- I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.

28:11.010 --> 28:12.971
I'm so lucky I married you.

28:15.223 --> 28:19.310
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?

28:20.228 --> 28:23.565
I found it. I found it.
I told you I would find it.

28:23.731 --> 28:25.984
In your face. You're a different person.

28:27.527 --> 28:29.362
Sorry.

28:29.779 --> 28:33.741
Okay. Flight 421, Paris.

28:34.450 --> 28:36.953
- I don't see it. Do you see it?
- No. Did we miss it?

28:37.120 --> 28:40.456
No, no, it's impossible.
It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.

28:40.623 --> 28:43.209
Maybe we have the flight number wrong.

28:43.376 --> 28:45.336
God.

28:47.589 --> 28:49.299
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.

28:49.465 --> 28:50.842
What?

28:51.926 --> 28:53.261
Hey. Hey, listen...

28:53.469 --> 28:57.640
You wouldn't believe the cute noises
the twins are making. Wait, listen.

28:57.849 --> 29:00.059
But Monica...

29:00.226 --> 29:04.606
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

29:05.565 --> 29:07.358
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.

29:07.567 --> 29:10.987
- That's all right. Listen, listen.
- Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.

29:11.154 --> 29:15.116
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

29:15.450 --> 29:17.035
- Monica?
- Isn't that cute?

29:17.243 --> 29:20.163
That is precious! Listen...

29:20.330 --> 29:23.625
- I need Rachel's flight information.
- Oh, okay.

29:24.083 --> 29:29.589
- All right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
- I have that. It's not on the board.

29:29.756 --> 29:33.927
That's what it says here. Flight 421.
Leaves at 8:40. Newark Airport.

29:34.135 --> 29:36.429
- What?
- Newark Airport.

29:36.638 --> 29:41.100
- Why? Where are you?
- JFK.

30:10.630 --> 30:14.217
Don't worry, you guys!
We're gonna get you out of there!

30:15.218 --> 30:18.930
And we're also gonna buy you
tiny bird hearing aids.

30:24.644 --> 30:27.981
Okay. Here goes.

30:32.694 --> 30:34.362
What's the matter?

30:35.071 --> 30:38.449
I need to say goodbye to the table first.

30:40.034 --> 30:41.869
I understand.

30:42.537 --> 30:44.205
Okay.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.211
Table...

30:52.005 --> 30:55.550
...you have given us
so many great times.

30:56.843 --> 31:03.474
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel...

31:03.891 --> 31:07.353
All of you guys. What can I say?

31:07.520 --> 31:13.026
You guys make us look good.

31:16.279 --> 31:19.365
- You want to say anything?
- I don't know.

31:20.742 --> 31:25.246
Except that, for one last time...

31:25.705 --> 31:28.333
Good game. Good game. Good game.

31:32.378 --> 31:34.047
- Good game.
- Yeah.

31:37.508 --> 31:39.510
Okay. Here we go.

31:47.602 --> 31:49.604
I can't do it.

31:50.396 --> 31:52.023
Well, I can't do it either.

31:53.232 --> 31:56.235
- Hey. Did you find them?
- Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.

31:56.402 --> 31:59.113
And we have to bust it open,
but neither of us can do it.

31:59.280 --> 32:04.494
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.

32:04.744 --> 32:06.746
I'll do it. Give me.

32:11.626 --> 32:14.420
Phoebe! No, no, no!

32:16.923 --> 32:19.592
Wow, I've never gone this fast before.

32:19.842 --> 32:23.096
Phoebe, forget it, okay?
Newark is, like, an hour away.

32:23.262 --> 32:25.098
There's no way we'll make it in time.

32:25.348 --> 32:29.102
- She's got her cell. You could call her.
- I am not doing this over the phone.

32:29.352 --> 32:31.104
You don't have any other choice.

32:38.444 --> 32:40.363
- Hello?
- Rachel. Oh, good.

32:40.571 --> 32:42.657
By the way,
did you just get on the plane?

32:42.824 --> 32:44.617
- Yeah.
- We would have caught her...

32:44.784 --> 32:47.328
- ...if we were at the right airport.
- Yay.

32:49.330 --> 32:50.873
Um, Rachel, hang on.

32:51.082 --> 32:53.292
No. No. No.

32:53.501 --> 32:55.211
Phoebe, is everything okay?

32:56.337 --> 32:57.463
Um...

32:57.630 --> 33:02.343
Actually, no. No.
You have to get off the plane.

33:02.510 --> 33:04.470
- What? Why?
- I have this feeling that...

33:04.637 --> 33:10.309
...something's wrong with it.
Something is wrong with the left phalange.

33:12.311 --> 33:15.189
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with the plane.

33:15.356 --> 33:20.653
Look, I have to go. I love you, and I
will call you the minute I get to Paris.

33:21.654 --> 33:23.156
Um, ahem...

33:23.322 --> 33:26.367
- What was that?
- Oh, that was just my crazy friend.

33:26.534 --> 33:30.079
She told me to get off the plane
because she had a "feeling" that there...

33:30.246 --> 33:33.916
...was something wrong
with the left phalange.

33:34.709 --> 33:38.337
- Okay. Uh, that doesn't sound good.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

33:38.504 --> 33:41.299
She comes up with this stuff,
and she's almost never right.

33:41.466 --> 33:44.135
- But she is sometimes.
- Well...

33:46.220 --> 33:48.598
- What are you doing?
- I can't take this plane now.

33:48.764 --> 33:52.101
- Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
- I have to get off this plane.

33:52.268 --> 33:56.439
Her friend has a feeling something's wrong
with the left phalange.

34:00.860 --> 34:02.487
Could I get some peanuts?

34:04.197 --> 34:06.949
- What's wrong with the plane?
- There's nothing wrong.

34:07.158 --> 34:10.036
- The left phalange.
- There's no "phalange."

34:10.244 --> 34:12.955
Oh, my God. This plane
doesn't even have a phalange.

34:14.540 --> 34:16.583
- I'm not flying on it.
- Please sit down.

34:16.792 --> 34:21.214
- What's going on'?
- We're getting off. There is no phalange!

34:24.759 --> 34:27.303
This is ridiculous. I...

34:29.554 --> 34:32.058
Yeah, okay.

34:39.940 --> 34:43.110
All right. My job here is done.

34:43.735 --> 34:46.656
That was impressive.

34:46.822 --> 34:50.451
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools
for most of it.

34:51.452 --> 34:53.246
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.

34:53.621 --> 34:58.459
All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
See you girls later.

35:01.921 --> 35:05.216
- Sorry about the table, man.
- Yeah.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.552
You gonna buy a new one?

35:08.594 --> 35:11.138
Probably not. No.

35:11.305 --> 35:14.433
I don't know how much I'm gonna
want to play after you go.

35:17.603 --> 35:20.856
- Well, at least we got these little guys out.
- Yeah.

35:21.023 --> 35:23.526
Aw, we were worried about you.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.488
Hm.

35:27.989 --> 35:32.326
I guess I better get used to things
crapping in my hand, huh?

35:40.960 --> 35:43.296
I'm gonna miss these little guys.

35:43.462 --> 35:45.298
It was nice having birds around again.

35:47.133 --> 35:50.886
Hey, you know what? Maybe we
should keep them here with you.

35:51.304 --> 35:53.973
- What?
- Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.

35:54.140 --> 35:57.310
And plus, here,
they'd have their own room.

35:58.519 --> 36:00.855
I could get a goose!

36:02.398 --> 36:06.110
You know, I think you're set
with the poultry.

36:08.321 --> 36:10.531
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?

36:10.698 --> 36:14.744
You're gonna get to stay here.
And it's good...

36:14.910 --> 36:17.330
...you know, because, uh...

36:17.997 --> 36:20.666
Because now you have a reason
to come visit.

36:23.502 --> 36:26.714
I think there may be another reason.

36:34.555 --> 36:36.349
So, uh...

36:38.100 --> 36:42.897
Awkward hug
or lame cool-guy handshake?

36:44.523 --> 36:46.859
Yeah, well, you know,
lame cool-guy handshake.

37:05.711 --> 37:11.092
- Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
- And you fixed the phalange?

37:11.967 --> 37:14.095
Yes. The phalange's fixed.

37:14.261 --> 37:18.432
In fact, we've put a whole lot of extra
phalanges on board, just in case.

37:20.726 --> 37:23.604
Paging Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Josh Anderson.

37:23.771 --> 37:25.523
- Where is she?
- I don't see her.

37:25.690 --> 37:27.900
- Rachel! Rachel Green!
- There she is!

37:28.067 --> 37:31.445
Rachel! Rachel!

37:31.737 --> 37:35.157
- Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?
- No. I just have to talk to someone.

37:35.324 --> 37:37.118
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.

37:37.410 --> 37:41.914
- No, no. But you don't...
- Rachel!

37:42.665 --> 37:46.043
What? Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?

37:46.877 --> 37:48.921
Okay. You're on.

37:49.171 --> 37:52.425
What? What, Ross? Okay, you're
scaring me. What's going on?

37:52.591 --> 37:55.469
- Okay. Thing is...
- Yeah.

37:56.303 --> 37:58.514
- Don't go.
- What?

37:58.681 --> 38:03.686
Please, please stay with me. I am
so in love with you. Please don't go.

38:04.812 --> 38:07.022
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I know.

38:07.189 --> 38:11.944
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
but, um... That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.

38:12.111 --> 38:14.989
But I'm telling you now. I love you.

38:16.115 --> 38:21.328
- Do not get on this plane.
- Miss, are you boarding the plane?

38:21.787 --> 38:23.456
(Hey, he)'-

38:23.914 --> 38:28.294
I know you love me. I know you do.

38:28.836 --> 38:30.504
- Miss
- l...

38:30.671 --> 38:33.340
I... I have to get on the plane.

38:33.507 --> 38:34.800
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

38:34.967 --> 38:37.636
- No, you don't.
- I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.

38:37.803 --> 38:41.307
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

38:41.474 --> 38:43.392
Rachel.

38:43.559 --> 38:45.978
I'm so sorry.

39:00.951 --> 39:02.411
I really thought she'd stay.

39:02.661 --> 39:04.663
I know.

39:04.830 --> 39:06.957
I'm sorry.

39:20.012 --> 39:23.265
Well, that's it.

39:23.474 --> 39:24.892
Everything's packed.

39:26.685 --> 39:28.103
Wow.

39:28.854 --> 39:31.190
- This is weird.
- I know.

39:31.357 --> 39:32.608
Yeah.

39:33.192 --> 39:36.195
Uh, does this mean
there's nothing to eat?

39:37.863 --> 39:39.865
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.

39:41.534 --> 39:43.869
I love you.

39:46.705 --> 39:49.375
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you guys make it in time?

39:49.542 --> 39:53.712
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her,
but, um, she got on the plane anyway.

39:56.048 --> 39:57.550
Where's Ross?

39:57.716 --> 39:59.927
He went home.
He didn't want to see anybody.

40:17.778 --> 40:21.782
Ross. Hi, it's me.

40:22.032 --> 40:26.745
I just got back on the plane,
and I just feel awful.

40:27.079 --> 40:31.417
That is so not how I wanted things
to end with us.

40:32.585 --> 40:35.588
It's just that I wasn't expecting
to see you.

40:35.754 --> 40:39.258
And all of a sudden you're there
and saying these things.

40:40.676 --> 40:43.679
Now I'm just sitting here and thinking...

40:43.846 --> 40:47.600
...of all the stuff I should have said
and I didn't.

40:47.850 --> 40:51.645
I mean, I didn't even get to tell you
that I love you too.

40:52.563 --> 40:55.774
Because of course I do. I love you.

40:57.860 --> 40:59.778
I love you.

41:00.487 --> 41:02.448
I love you.

41:02.948 --> 41:07.286
What am I doing? I love you.

41:09.455 --> 41:12.458
I've got to see you.
I've got to get off this plane.

41:12.625 --> 41:14.376
Oh, my God.

41:14.585 --> 41:17.630
- Okay, excuse me.
- Miss, please sit down.

41:17.796 --> 41:20.966
No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
but I need to get off the plane.

41:21.133 --> 41:24.178
- I need to tell someone that I love them.
- I can't let you off.

41:24.345 --> 41:27.306
Let her off the plane!

41:27.973 --> 41:29.808
You have to take your seat.

41:29.975 --> 41:32.394
Oh, please, miss.
You don't understand.

41:32.561 --> 41:35.147
Try to understand!

41:35.314 --> 41:38.150
Come on, miss, isn't there any way
that you can just let me off the...?

41:39.652 --> 41:41.528
No! No!

41:42.029 --> 41:46.742
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane?
Did she get off the plane?

41:48.160 --> 41:50.829
I got off the plane.

42:00.839 --> 42:02.675
You got off the plane.

42:15.020 --> 42:17.606
I do love you.

42:17.815 --> 42:20.359
I love you too, and I am never
letting you go again.

42:20.567 --> 42:23.862
Okay. Because this is where I want
to be. Okay? No more messing around.

42:24.071 --> 42:28.200
- I don't want to mess this up again.
- Me neither. We're done being stupid.

42:28.367 --> 42:31.036
Okay. It's you and me, all right?
This is it.

42:31.203 --> 42:34.873
This is it. Unless we're on a break.

42:44.633 --> 42:46.343
Don't make jokes now.

43:07.448 --> 43:10.409
Okay, please be careful with that.
It was my grandmother's. Be careful.

43:10.617 --> 43:12.202
Thank you.

43:12.411 --> 43:15.789
If that falls off the truck,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

43:24.423 --> 43:26.050
Wow.

43:27.676 --> 43:29.386
I know.

43:29.595 --> 43:32.264
Seems smaller somehow.

43:33.724 --> 43:37.186
Has it always been purple?

43:39.730 --> 43:43.901
Look around, you guys.
This was your first home.

43:45.152 --> 43:51.200
And it was a happy place,
filled with love and laughter.

43:51.366 --> 43:56.163
But more important, because
of rent control, it was a frigging steal.

43:59.917 --> 44:05.047
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or
another, we all lived in this apartment?

44:05.631 --> 44:07.382
Oh, yeah. That's true.

44:07.591 --> 44:09.968
Uh, I haven't.

44:11.053 --> 44:14.306
What about that summer during college
that you lived with Grandma...

44:14.473 --> 44:17.267
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?

44:21.980 --> 44:25.984
Do you realize we almost made it
10 years without that coming up?

44:30.405 --> 44:33.325
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger
that we'd leave our keys.

44:33.492 --> 44:35.744
Oh, okay.

45:09.778 --> 45:13.157
- So I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

45:14.658 --> 45:16.118
I guess so.

45:18.245 --> 45:20.664
This is harder than I thought
it would be.

45:20.831 --> 45:23.375
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

45:26.003 --> 45:27.629
Come on.

45:34.970 --> 45:39.099
Do you guys have to go to the new
house now, or do you have some time?

45:41.768 --> 45:43.145
We got some time.

45:43.770 --> 45:47.733
- Okay. Should we get some coffee?
- Sure.

45:48.817 --> 45:50.402
Where?
