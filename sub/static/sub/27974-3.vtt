01:33.960 --> 01:38.960
Morning, Mister Clamp.
Letty. Just the one. Airmail.

01:48.073 --> 01:50.233
Nothing today, Mister Carraway.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.960
Chigton 3782. Veterinary Surgery.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.959
- You're not dressed.
- I'm going to cry off.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.999
Bit of a head.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.314
Nonsense. Bit of fresh air, put some
colour in your cheeks, do you good.

03:13.315 --> 03:15.959
Curling up with a good book
will do me better.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.546
Pa won't like it.

03:17.547 --> 03:21.960
He'll have to not like it, then,
won't he? Have a wonderful time.

03:23.033 --> 03:24.513
Hounds, please.

03:54.586 --> 03:57.586
Aye-aye, matey. Doc.

03:57.644 --> 03:59.483
What's the what?

03:59.484 --> 04:01.362
Overdose, looks to be.

04:01.363 --> 04:03.023
That'll be the fourth since August.

04:03.363 --> 04:05.363
Three others across Division.

04:06.486 --> 04:07.776
Choked on his own puke, has he?

04:08.763 --> 04:11.362
Been at the keats again, Sergeant?

04:11.363 --> 04:14.185
Yes, choked on his own puke

04:14.210 --> 04:17.875
or asphyxia appears the
most likely cause of death.

04:17.875 --> 04:21.559
Furthers and betters
once I've had a fillet.

04:22.142 --> 04:23.606
Shall we say two o'clock, Morse?

04:23.607 --> 04:25.307
Oh, I can't, I'm seeing a flat at two.

04:25.308 --> 04:28.607
I can cover for you. Give you the
gen, if there's anything comes up.

04:29.283 --> 04:31.126
As you please.

04:31.127 --> 04:32.803
- Thanks.
- Sergeant.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.309
What's with the flat? I thought
you were at the Section House?

04:37.310 --> 04:39.966
I'm just a bit long in the tooth
for rugby songs

04:39.967 --> 04:43.606
and bare backsides in the hallway.
I need my own four walls.

04:43.607 --> 04:45.606
Expect he could've done
with a bit of that.

04:45.607 --> 04:49.606
Probably had it once, an' all.
Missus, too, maybe.

04:49.607 --> 04:52.607
Kids. Who knows.

04:56.140 --> 04:57.446
Keep your ear to the ground.

04:57.447 --> 04:59.607
Hear anything else,
you know where to find me.

05:40.287 --> 05:43.287
Ru! Ru!

05:47.032 --> 05:50.072
Bucephalus is lame. Give me Old Glory.

05:54.607 --> 05:57.899
No ID on the victim. But I found these.

05:58.643 --> 06:00.647
Any leads on the heroin?

06:01.403 --> 06:04.606
That truck stop out
on the Bainbridge Road maybe.

06:04.607 --> 06:06.606
Lorries coming in from the continent.

06:06.607 --> 06:08.607
Been a few rocker types mooching about.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.647
Something and nothing.

06:22.533 --> 06:25.803
Is your father there?
Pa's horse has gone lame.

06:27.607 --> 06:29.771
If you'd let him know
when he returns, Mrs Fairford,

06:29.772 --> 06:30.883
I'd be very grateful.

06:31.607 --> 06:33.803
Yes, I think it might be quite bad.

06:35.607 --> 06:38.607
Thank you. Goodbye.

06:48.206 --> 06:50.046
Sarah?

06:54.607 --> 06:56.607
Morning, Farmer Bell.

07:34.967 --> 07:38.003
Sir! Master Murray!

07:50.607 --> 07:52.607
Easy, old boy.

08:05.647 --> 08:09.606
- Pa!
- Pa!

08:09.607 --> 08:12.607
- Mr Greville!
- Pa! - Pa!

08:14.079 --> 08:16.079
Here! Here!

08:26.607 --> 08:30.249
Deceased is one Greville Creswell,
boss, according to the local bobby.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.606
Creswell's sweets? They're out
Chigton Green way, aren't they?

08:33.607 --> 08:35.096
What? Milky Boy and all that?

08:35.097 --> 08:36.606
Mr Creswell owned the company.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.606
The factory's a mile or so
outside the village.

08:38.607 --> 08:41.163
He lived at Creswell Hall,
a few miles up the road.

08:41.607 --> 08:44.607
Right. Start the ball rolling.

08:57.163 --> 09:00.606
He was Master of the Chigton Hunt.
His horse went lame,

09:00.607 --> 09:02.606
so he borrowed Rupert's, his younger son.

09:02.607 --> 09:03.607
Doctor.

09:03.608 --> 09:05.646
Ah, gentlemen.

09:05.647 --> 09:08.606
One shot to the left side of the chest,

09:08.607 --> 09:11.606
which presumably
knocked him out of the saddle.

09:11.607 --> 09:15.286
Unlikely he'd have survived
without urgent medical attention

09:15.287 --> 09:19.126
and the coup de grace
to the head from point blank.

09:19.127 --> 09:21.606
- Shotgun?
- Yes.

09:21.607 --> 09:24.606
- Twelve-bore by the look of things.
- Anything as to a time?

09:24.607 --> 09:26.243
2:39.

09:27.563 --> 09:30.607
One of the balls smashed his wristwatch.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.606
Can you make a start on the locals?

09:35.607 --> 09:38.446
Particulars and preliminary alibis
for now.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.967
Who was where between two and three.

09:42.607 --> 09:44.606
Anything we should know about the family?

09:44.607 --> 09:46.606
No, sir. All very well liked.

09:46.607 --> 09:47.607
They all got on, did they?

09:47.607 --> 09:48.607
As far as I know, sir.

10:30.607 --> 10:32.606
Detective Inspector Thursday,
Thames Valley.

10:32.607 --> 10:34.286
Detective Sergeant Morse.

10:34.287 --> 10:37.157
Murray Creswell. My wife Clemmie

10:37.158 --> 10:39.606
and my younger brother Rupert,
and his fiancee Sarah.

10:39.607 --> 10:41.606
Our condolences.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.287
Thank you. Thank you very much.

10:44.733 --> 10:46.053
Yes, it's er...

10:46.607 --> 10:49.606
...been an enormous shock,
as you can imagine.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.607
I'm sure.

10:51.647 --> 10:55.606
Nevertheless, there are
some questions we'll need to ask

10:55.607 --> 10:57.606
to find out who did this to your father.

10:57.607 --> 10:59.606
Of course.

10:59.607 --> 11:01.606
Is there a Mrs Creswell Senior?

11:01.607 --> 11:05.606
Ma? No, Ma died six years ago.
Much missed.

11:05.607 --> 11:06.646
At least she didn't live to see this day.

11:06.647 --> 11:09.606
No. No, there's that.

11:09.607 --> 11:13.972
May I offer you some refreshment?
Tea? Something stronger?

11:13.973 --> 11:16.127
Not for me, thank you.

11:17.607 --> 11:20.606
Can I start by asking where you all were

11:20.607 --> 11:24.446
between the hours of two thirty
and three o'clock, say?

11:24.447 --> 11:26.606
We'll also need to
talk to the staff here.

11:26.607 --> 11:28.646
But we're not bloody suspects,
for God's sake.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.563
I'm sure it's just procedure.

11:31.287 --> 11:33.606
I was on my way back to the house
with Pa's horse.

11:33.607 --> 11:37.606
I suppose I got here about
half past one, quarter to two.

11:37.607 --> 11:42.843
Walked Bucephalus round the stable,
I called Shepherd, the vet.

11:43.807 --> 11:45.606
That was about it really.

11:45.607 --> 11:48.607
Clemmie and I were out with the hunt.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.607
Somewhere toward Pigstanton.

11:51.403 --> 11:53.606
Was that the same for you, Miss...?

11:53.607 --> 11:58.606
Clamp. No. I had a headache,
I didn't go out and stayed here.

11:58.607 --> 12:00.607
I thought you said you went for a walk?

12:02.003 --> 12:04.606
In the end, I went
for a turn around the grounds,

12:04.607 --> 12:06.257
see if I could shake it off.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.286
Next thing I knew, everyone was back.

12:08.287 --> 12:09.606
Could anyone vouch for you?

12:09.607 --> 12:13.606
I didn't run into any of the staff,
if that's what you mean?

12:13.607 --> 12:16.607
Did Mr Creswell have any enemies?

12:17.203 --> 12:19.606
- No.
- No troubles at work?

12:19.607 --> 12:23.606
Good heavens, no.
Pa was a very fair employer.

12:23.607 --> 12:25.606
Creswell's is a family firm.

12:25.607 --> 12:28.607
We've always been taught to look on
the workers as part of the family.

12:30.203 --> 12:32.607
We've heard talk about a
possible takeover by Gidbury's.

12:33.323 --> 12:34.606
Anything in that?

12:34.607 --> 12:36.607
It wouldn't have been a takeover.

12:37.163 --> 12:39.606
More of a partnership.
Creswell and Gidbury.

12:39.607 --> 12:41.127
And how long would that have lasted?

12:41.763 --> 12:45.275
Gidbury's would have sold us
to Consolidated Foodstuffs

12:45.276 --> 12:48.607
the first chance they got,
an American firm.

12:48.963 --> 12:50.861
Who will be head of the company now?

12:50.886 --> 12:53.886
Really? Is that something to ask today?

12:54.163 --> 12:56.446
It's not something we've discussed.

12:56.447 --> 12:59.607
We thought Pa would go on
for a long time yet.

13:00.143 --> 13:03.607
Ru and I both work there, but on
different sides of the company.

13:04.607 --> 13:07.913
Pa had... the final say...

13:08.679 --> 13:10.516
in all things.

13:14.607 --> 13:16.303
There's Jago.

13:20.325 --> 13:21.814
I'll speak to this vet, Shepherd,

13:21.839 --> 13:23.606
see if Rupert Creswell's story stands up.

13:23.607 --> 13:24.783
Right.

13:34.135 --> 13:36.828
So, Greville Creswell.

13:36.829 --> 13:39.162
No, he's not been
formally identified yet.

13:39.188 --> 13:40.348
Anything to go on?

13:40.915 --> 13:42.915
Well, nothing that we want to see
in the papers.

13:43.829 --> 13:45.829
Do you know the place?

13:46.123 --> 13:47.809
More or less.
Well, somewhere like it, at least.

13:49.198 --> 13:52.304
If you want the real inside gen
on Chigton Green,

13:52.305 --> 13:54.299
you could do worse
than talk to Miss Ling,

13:54.300 --> 13:55.828
our advice columnist.

13:55.829 --> 13:58.828
- 'Dear Worried Brown Eyes...'
- She's very good.

13:58.829 --> 14:02.188
I'm sure. If you could pass her
number to PC Potter, local bobby.

14:02.189 --> 14:05.246
Only got a PO Box for her.
She's a bit of a mystery.

14:05.246 --> 14:06.592
Values her anonymity.

14:06.593 --> 14:09.003
Don't we all.

14:16.903 --> 14:20.163
Hello, Detective Sergeant Morse,
Thames Valley. Miss...?

14:20.489 --> 14:21.809
Mrs Fairford.

14:23.483 --> 14:26.043
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

14:29.483 --> 14:32.482
Is this about what happened with
Grev Creswell?

14:32.483 --> 14:37.162
It's all round the place. No secrets
here, I'm afraid. Village life.

14:37.163 --> 14:39.243
Yes, yes, it is.

14:40.483 --> 14:42.483
That's Henry, my little boy.

14:42.671 --> 14:44.671
Dad's with a patient,
I'll let him know you're here.

14:44.696 --> 14:47.696
- Thank you.
- I shan't keep you.

14:48.483 --> 14:50.482
Dad, a policeman is here to see you.

14:50.483 --> 14:53.854
Most of the shopkeepers haven't
turned a step outside the village

14:53.855 --> 14:55.482
since they opened up this morning.

14:55.483 --> 14:57.482
How'd you make out with the family?

14:57.483 --> 15:00.482
The older son, Murray,
and his wife both have alibis.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.483
As do the staff.

15:01.883 --> 15:03.952
But there's no-one to vouch
for the younger son,

15:03.953 --> 15:05.662
nor his fiancee, Sarah Clamp.

15:05.663 --> 15:09.482
The grocer's daughter? I've just
been speaking to her parents.

15:09.483 --> 15:12.483
She used to work at the factory.
Personnel. How she met the lad.

15:13.083 --> 15:14.483
She landed on her feet, then.

15:15.203 --> 15:16.643
Landed on something.

15:21.483 --> 15:26.482
Let's see, um... I had lunch here
at the surgery with Isla.

15:26.483 --> 15:31.482
Erm, but I was on my way to
Mr Swann's farm by about two-ish.

15:31.483 --> 15:34.482
And I had left again by, what,
about three

15:34.483 --> 15:37.482
and I telephoned here to see
if there'd been anymore calls.

15:37.483 --> 15:40.483
And that's when Isla told me
about Bucephalus.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.002
D'you know Mister Creswell well?

15:43.003 --> 15:44.162
Not really, no.

15:44.163 --> 15:47.647
I've looked after their animals
since we moved to Chigton in '63,

15:47.648 --> 15:51.248
but, er... I can't really say
I know any of them.

15:51.249 --> 15:55.482
Oh, apart from Sarah Clamp,
of course, I knew her slightly.

15:55.483 --> 15:56.483
How's that?

15:56.484 --> 15:59.322
I used to have a small
animal practice at Upper Pembury,

15:59.323 --> 16:01.483
she's a cousin there, Rufus.

16:02.043 --> 16:04.482
Nice boy, rather highly strung.

16:04.483 --> 16:07.028
Anyway, he's done well for himself.
He's at Oxford now.

16:07.029 --> 16:10.806
His mother had a very overfed Pekingese.

16:11.563 --> 16:14.763
I must have ran into Sarah
once or twice over there.

16:16.483 --> 16:18.043
Nice girl.

16:30.483 --> 16:33.673
Old Ezekiel says he saw Farmer Bell,
Rennett Bell,

16:33.674 --> 16:35.482
making his way up into the
Hangman's Wood with a shotgun

16:35.483 --> 16:37.204
just after half two.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.482
Anything between Bell and Creswell?

16:39.483 --> 16:43.482
Not that I know of. Ren's
a moody sod at the best of times.

16:43.483 --> 16:46.482
Take a run out there.
Have a word with Bell.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.483
See what he was doing out in the woods.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.483
You been out this way long?

16:55.203 --> 16:57.036
Five years, more or less.

16:57.037 --> 16:59.482
- Decent beat?
- I like it.

16:59.483 --> 17:01.322
Nothing out of the ordinary.

17:01.323 --> 17:03.843
Just people going about their business.

17:05.803 --> 17:08.483
Oh, er, take the next left.

17:23.483 --> 17:25.123
Oh, Christ...

17:26.163 --> 17:27.403
Call it in.

17:39.047 --> 17:41.127
Call it in, Constable.

17:43.658 --> 17:45.657
Information Room from four-two-nine-two.

17:45.658 --> 17:47.658
Urgent assistance required
at Bell's Farm.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.118
You're not going in? He's armed.

17:51.119 --> 17:52.858
'Do you require medical assistance?'

17:57.658 --> 17:58.807
Hello?

18:03.224 --> 18:05.224
Hello, Mr Bell?

18:06.430 --> 18:08.430
It's the police.

18:08.604 --> 18:10.604
Is there anybody there?

18:24.598 --> 18:27.438
I'm coming up the stairs.

19:25.658 --> 19:30.657
Looks to have taken both barrels
in the back at fairly short range.

19:30.658 --> 19:35.657
Massive haemorrhaging and heaven
knows what damage to her organs.

19:35.658 --> 19:38.657
Death would have been
more or less instantaneous.

19:38.658 --> 19:42.017
Between eight and 12 hours ago.

19:42.018 --> 19:43.490
Well, she's in her work uniform.

19:43.491 --> 19:47.657
Yeah. She, er...
she worked at Creswell's.

19:47.658 --> 19:49.657
Well, if she clocked on
at eight thirty, nine,

19:49.658 --> 19:52.657
that would make it
seven thirty, eight this morning?

19:52.658 --> 19:54.657
What about him upstairs?

19:54.658 --> 19:58.887
Oh, no, much later.
Three to four hours ago?

20:06.171 --> 20:07.830
He'd a history of violence, you say?

20:08.807 --> 20:10.658
Constable?

20:11.971 --> 20:13.127
All right?

20:15.244 --> 20:18.244
Yeah. Yeah. Just that...

20:18.269 --> 20:19.567
You knew her?

20:21.630 --> 20:22.767
Bad luck.

20:24.338 --> 20:26.413
He was violent, Bell.

20:26.438 --> 20:28.007
Nothing like this.

20:28.658 --> 20:30.987
Ren was just a brawler
when the drinks were in him.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.012
Never with women.

20:32.658 --> 20:34.647
So, what d'you make to it, then?

20:35.018 --> 20:37.657
Man kills his wife
and then another bloke,

20:37.658 --> 20:39.607
usually only one reason behind it.

20:40.057 --> 20:42.057
And himself into the bargain.

20:42.404 --> 20:43.764
What about her next of kin?

20:43.789 --> 20:45.949
Her brother's in the village.

20:45.974 --> 20:48.454
Michael Murphy, the baker.
You want me to take you across?

20:48.479 --> 20:50.479
No, no, you're all right. We'll manage.

20:50.658 --> 20:53.657
Keep Sergeant Morse company
while he finishes up here.

20:53.658 --> 20:56.658
- He'll run you into the village.
- But we're done, aren't we?

20:58.658 --> 21:00.727
Pays to be thorough, Sergeant.

21:01.658 --> 21:03.487
See you back at the ranch.

21:10.658 --> 21:14.087
Is this your sister, Mandy-Jane Bell?

22:07.557 --> 22:08.757
Anything?

22:16.458 --> 22:19.498
We know your sister
worked at the sweet factory.

22:20.697 --> 22:25.497
Is it possible she was...
involved with Greville Creswell?

22:27.191 --> 22:29.191
Mandy was a wild girl, but...

22:29.658 --> 22:32.487
I can't believe she'd carry on
with anyone behind Ren's back.

22:33.178 --> 22:34.858
And certainly not Creswell.

22:36.504 --> 22:38.344
Can you think of anything

22:38.498 --> 22:40.658
that could have led her husband
to do what he did?

22:41.447 --> 22:45.658
No. No, he must've gone mad.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.657
"Your wife is sleeping with Creswell."

22:51.658 --> 22:53.374
To the point.

22:53.399 --> 22:56.987
It's not the first you've seen like
that, with the Happy Families card?

22:57.012 --> 23:00.172
You get letters like this
in any town or village.

23:00.658 --> 23:03.767
Local fall-outs
turning into shop thy neighbour.

23:04.444 --> 23:07.444
These always come with one of them in.

23:07.658 --> 23:09.657
Calling card, you might say.

23:09.658 --> 23:11.657
How many is always?

23:11.658 --> 23:13.207
Once a week or so.

23:13.771 --> 23:15.571
Since when?

23:15.596 --> 23:20.596
January, maybe. Started after
Sarah Clamp's grandmother died.

23:20.621 --> 23:22.767
Natural causes, the inquest found.

23:22.924 --> 23:25.244
Only the Clamps got a letter
to say that Mister Carraway

23:25.269 --> 23:27.109
had sold the old girl some bad fish.

23:28.511 --> 23:29.750
Anything in it?

23:29.775 --> 23:31.147
Well, I wouldn't have said.

23:31.337 --> 23:33.337
But I would have thought
it was just some trouble-maker.

23:33.362 --> 23:35.447
But since then we've had all sorts.

23:36.550 --> 23:38.687
Different envelopes, but always typed.

23:39.244 --> 23:40.444
And always with an Oxford postmark?

23:40.469 --> 23:42.269
Which doesn't make any sense.

23:42.517 --> 23:44.527
Cos whoever sent them knows the village.

23:47.384 --> 23:52.744
Isla, do you have Mister Cobb, the baker?

23:58.524 --> 24:02.524
Henry, do you have Master Cobb,
the baker's son?

24:03.007 --> 24:06.658
Oh, no!

24:31.710 --> 24:34.710
- You are good to me, Puli.
- Nonsense.

24:35.084 --> 24:36.924
But you are.

24:36.949 --> 24:38.469
If you say so.

24:45.658 --> 24:46.658
How was London?

24:47.247 --> 24:49.927
I looked in at the RA.

24:50.658 --> 24:52.657
French paintings since 1900.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.657
All from private collections.

24:55.658 --> 24:57.338
Was it lovely?

24:58.167 --> 25:00.407
It was rather.

25:03.318 --> 25:05.318
Oh, I didn't tell you, did I?

25:05.343 --> 25:10.023
Jocelyn Grant-Menzies saw your
advertisement or whatever it is.

25:10.048 --> 25:11.368
With the bird.

25:11.393 --> 25:12.527
Did she?

25:12.837 --> 25:14.997
She said she thought it was awfully good.

25:15.318 --> 25:19.318
And that you were... terribly natural.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.658
Married to a film star!

25:31.617 --> 25:33.111
I was thinking of getting someone in.

25:33.136 --> 25:34.224
Were you?

25:34.249 --> 25:35.249
For the garden.

25:36.327 --> 25:39.658
I thought perhaps I might put in
some jasmine, what do you think?

25:40.570 --> 25:43.570
We used to have a whole lump of
the stuff at the Hill Station.

25:43.595 --> 25:44.595
Do you remember?

25:45.647 --> 25:48.007
You always said you liked the smell.

25:53.127 --> 25:54.487
Good heavens.

25:57.758 --> 25:59.847
My dear, was it something I said?

26:00.658 --> 26:02.367
I...

26:05.923 --> 26:08.657
I saw Julian Fitzalan today.

26:08.658 --> 26:11.657
Julian? Everything's all right
with him and Norah, is it?

26:11.658 --> 26:14.167
They're perfectly happy.

26:18.485 --> 26:20.685
What, what is it, then, my dear?

26:25.151 --> 26:26.671
What's upset you?

26:29.451 --> 26:31.007
I don't think...

26:33.284 --> 26:35.284
...I've been a very good wife.

26:37.658 --> 26:39.698
No man ever had a better.

26:50.207 --> 26:52.658
Looks a bit like Greville Creswell,
don't you think?

26:53.287 --> 26:54.657
What's this?

26:54.658 --> 26:56.807
Something Morse found at Bell's farm.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.657
We're done with Chigton Green, aren't we?

26:59.658 --> 27:02.647
Two victims, one killer,
Bob's your mother's fancy man.

27:03.298 --> 27:04.658
Somebody wrote Bell a poison pen letter

27:04.683 --> 27:06.867
claiming that his wife
was sleeping with Creswell.

27:06.892 --> 27:10.348
- So?
- So, what if she wasn't?

27:10.524 --> 27:12.524
You've only got her brother's word
for that.

27:12.549 --> 27:14.549
It's what Bell thought that matters.

27:14.658 --> 27:17.187
We'll take a run out to the factory.
Talk to the Creswells.

27:17.212 --> 27:19.052
If it makes you feel better,

27:19.077 --> 27:21.487
but I don't want any more time
spending on this than we have to.

27:21.955 --> 27:23.795
This is about
as open and shut as it gets.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.857
And what if the next person to get
one of these poison pen letters

27:26.858 --> 27:29.658
reacts the same way as Rennett Bell?
What then?

27:53.698 --> 27:56.167
Good morning,
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

27:56.658 --> 27:59.087
If you'd like to follow me,
Murray's waiting in the boardroom.

28:00.918 --> 28:02.657
Had your father been in receipt

28:02.658 --> 28:05.127
of any of these anonymous letters
doing the rounds?

28:06.391 --> 28:09.391
If it were the case, he never
mentioned it to either of us.

28:09.658 --> 28:12.657
- How about yourselves?
- No, why?

28:12.658 --> 28:14.829
Rennett Bell received one.

28:14.830 --> 28:18.157
Alleging an affair between
your father and Mrs Bell.

28:18.158 --> 28:19.698
An affair?

28:20.527 --> 28:22.657
- You think that's why...
- That's preposterous.

28:22.658 --> 28:24.657
Pa was old enough to be her father.

28:24.658 --> 28:26.647
I doubt he even knew her name.

28:27.658 --> 28:30.967
I'd be very grateful if
you'd keep all that to yourselves.

28:31.658 --> 28:33.901
Pa's death has sent
the share price tumbling.

28:33.902 --> 28:37.007
Any lower and we'll be liable to
a hostile takeover from Gidbury's.

28:40.031 --> 28:42.031
How long had Mrs Bell been working here?

28:42.658 --> 28:46.186
A year or two. You'd need to ask
Miss Neal in personnel for details.

28:46.187 --> 28:47.967
Ru can take you down there.

28:50.658 --> 28:53.423
Sergeant Morse tells me you've
been here over a hundred years.

28:53.448 --> 28:56.448
Yes, yes, indeed. 1832.

28:56.847 --> 28:59.120
I suppose things really got going
in the Great Exhibition

28:59.121 --> 29:01.093
with the launch of the
Happy Family Assortment Box.

29:01.094 --> 29:03.332
It became a bit of a craze.
Collect them all.

29:03.333 --> 29:04.892
And Mr Chou, the confectioner,

29:04.893 --> 29:06.498
is a caricature of
your father, I believe?

29:06.523 --> 29:07.833
That's right.

29:07.834 --> 29:09.559
Traditionally, they've been
based on the workers

29:09.560 --> 29:10.739
and villagers hereabouts.

29:10.740 --> 29:13.307
All in good fun, of course.
And we do ask permission.

29:13.491 --> 29:14.703
You get the odd grump,

29:14.728 --> 29:16.567
but most people take it
as a bit of an honour.

29:24.698 --> 29:26.327
This way, please.

29:30.658 --> 29:36.697
Mrs Bell had been with us
18 months. Only part-time.

29:36.698 --> 29:39.540
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

29:39.565 --> 29:41.045
Reliable?

29:41.070 --> 29:44.736
Well, I see from her records that
she had to be reprimanded earlier,

29:44.737 --> 29:46.767
- after the Christmas party.
- For what?

29:47.344 --> 29:50.107
She'd drunk rather too much and was...

29:50.132 --> 29:52.812
indiscreet about Mister Rupert's fiancee.

29:53.338 --> 29:56.347
Miss Clamp? In what way?

29:56.372 --> 29:59.372
Miss Clamp used to work at the factory.

29:59.397 --> 30:00.397
So, what happened?

30:00.422 --> 30:01.998
I don't know exactly what went on,

30:02.023 --> 30:04.007
but it ended up with Sarah
throwing a drink over her.

30:04.204 --> 30:07.564
And would Mrs Bell have anything
to do with Mister Creswell Senior?

30:08.018 --> 30:12.657
No. She worked in the Jelly Room.

30:12.658 --> 30:15.382
Has the company received
any of these poison pen letters

30:15.383 --> 30:16.658
that have been doing the rounds?

30:17.127 --> 30:22.034
The company hasn't,
but there's many of the staff have.

30:22.035 --> 30:24.657
I've had a few letters myself.

30:24.658 --> 30:26.657
Did you show them to Constable Potter?

30:26.658 --> 30:30.658
I couldn't very well, seeing as
he's the subject of one of them.

30:33.817 --> 30:37.137
It came with a Mister Truncheon,
the policeman card,

30:37.162 --> 30:40.162
and intimated Mandy-Jane and he were...

30:41.658 --> 30:43.127
Is there anything in that?

30:43.277 --> 30:49.447
They were an item once,
but I think... she disappointed him.

31:07.047 --> 31:10.333
If Mandy-Jane Bell was carrying on
with Greville Creswell,

31:10.333 --> 31:12.332
the family
certainly didn't know about it.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.004
- What about her work mates?
- None that we spoke to.

31:15.005 --> 31:17.332
They said she was high-spirited,
a bit of a handful,

31:17.333 --> 31:19.736
but that she was devoted to him,
even though he was a difficult type.

31:19.737 --> 31:22.348
You'd think if she was knocking off
the boss, she might've let slip.

31:22.349 --> 31:24.761
Can't see her keeping it quiet.
Not in a place like that

31:24.762 --> 31:26.661
where everyone knows
each other's business.

31:26.662 --> 31:29.332
It was a lie, then,
whoever sent the letter.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.532
No way to know that
Bell'd react the way he did.

31:31.533 --> 31:33.333
What if they did know?

31:33.982 --> 31:36.692
Potter said Bell could be violent,
unpredictable.

31:36.693 --> 31:38.185
What if that's what they gambled on?

31:38.210 --> 31:40.784
That he'd go mad and kill his wife
and Creswell into the bargain?

31:40.809 --> 31:42.344
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?

31:42.706 --> 31:44.706
What if whoever wrote that letter
was pointing him at Creswell,

31:44.731 --> 31:47.251
- hoping he'd react the way he did?
- Why would they?

31:47.276 --> 31:48.756
Well, there's a lot of worry in the area

31:48.781 --> 31:50.781
about the potential of
the company moving away.

31:51.333 --> 31:54.332
- I don't know. Feels off to me.
- Me too.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.864
The long and the short is
Rennett Bell did for them both.

31:56.889 --> 31:59.049
Anything else is just speculation.

31:59.333 --> 32:00.704
Put it to bed.

32:00.729 --> 32:02.884
Well, I don't think that
we've heard the last of it.

32:03.644 --> 32:05.332
Noted.

32:05.333 --> 32:08.364
Meantime, there's a sudden
with your name on it come in,

32:08.739 --> 32:11.419
over Hescott College. Jago's got the gen.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.333
Livener, Fred?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Yeah.

32:19.066 --> 32:20.484
Yeah, why not.

32:44.853 --> 32:49.333
I'm sorry. It's all a bit coppery,
I'm afraid.

32:49.524 --> 32:53.741
Appropriately enough.
Just a hint of sucrose.

32:53.742 --> 32:58.333
Oh, must you? It's a bloodbath,
not a Cotes du Rhone.

33:01.787 --> 33:03.307
What's the, uh...?

33:03.332 --> 33:08.308
Chap called Bura. Rufus Bura.
Research fellow, apparently.

33:09.604 --> 33:11.332
Anything suspicious?

33:11.333 --> 33:15.332
Medically, I can't really comment
until after the PM,

33:15.333 --> 33:17.333
but it all looks pretty textbook.

33:18.832 --> 33:21.832
A couple of tentative slashes
on the left wrist

33:22.186 --> 33:25.226
before screwing his courage
to the sticking place.

33:25.373 --> 33:28.904
Aspirin and brandy.
For literal good measure.

33:28.929 --> 33:31.929
Otherwise, alles in Ordnung.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.524
Mahler.

33:33.999 --> 33:36.999
No solipsistic impulse
knowingly overlooked.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.892
People do despair, Morse.

33:43.733 --> 33:45.893
You don't say.

33:47.899 --> 33:51.259
It'd gone, the flat.
The one o'clock viewing took it.

33:51.693 --> 33:53.692
Oh, bad luck.

33:53.693 --> 33:56.469
I'm thinking of looking
a little further out.

33:56.470 --> 33:58.036
How far's further?

33:58.037 --> 34:01.332
There's a place in Chigton Green
to let. Looks quite nice.

34:01.333 --> 34:03.844
Well, all the best with it.

34:04.166 --> 34:06.526
How did you get on with
the derelict the other morning?

34:06.551 --> 34:12.643
Oh, no surprises there.
Asphyxia... inhaled his own vomitus.

34:12.793 --> 34:14.793
It doesn't sound any better in Latin.

34:14.818 --> 34:16.818
Blood results came in this morning.

34:17.159 --> 34:22.360
Heroin cut with quinine to about the
same ratio as the other overdoses.

34:22.385 --> 34:24.567
Same supplier, then, or dealer, at least?

34:24.592 --> 34:28.592
I've copied in James Strange. He
asked. I trust that was all right.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.331
Dental and fingerprints attached.

34:32.333 --> 34:35.043
Still unidentified, I presume?

34:35.166 --> 34:37.166
A soldier, possibly.

34:37.333 --> 34:39.123
'Known Unto God.'

35:54.333 --> 35:56.764
- KEYS IN DOOR
- Home.

36:04.804 --> 36:06.533
Oh, off out, are you?

36:07.244 --> 36:08.924
You know I am.

36:14.333 --> 36:20.084
I was thinking... maybe we could go
away somewhere for a week or two.

36:20.924 --> 36:22.548
Got some leave due.

36:22.549 --> 36:24.844
What with? Washers?

36:28.099 --> 36:29.204
What's this?

36:29.873 --> 36:33.084
Oh, just some chocolates.

36:33.964 --> 36:36.364
You used to like Happy Family.

36:38.806 --> 36:40.806
- Creswell's.
- That's right.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.332
Didn't one of them get killed?

36:43.333 --> 36:45.332
I read about it in the paper
this morning.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.724
We were up the factory earlier,
me and Morse.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.006
They've got a little kiosk there.

36:50.031 --> 36:52.484
I just saw them and thought of you.

36:53.173 --> 36:54.372
You needn't have.

36:54.373 --> 36:56.364
I wanted to.

36:59.453 --> 37:02.440
Put me in mind of when we'd settle
down in here with the kids

37:02.465 --> 37:05.118
of a Saturday to
watch the big film, you remember?

37:07.087 --> 37:10.447
Joanie and Sam were always
after you for the card.

37:10.472 --> 37:14.112
You'd give one one week
and the other the next, remember?

37:16.259 --> 37:18.259
Still got them somewhere, I expect.

37:18.844 --> 37:21.333
Be worth something now.

37:23.666 --> 37:24.866
To who?

37:25.800 --> 37:27.164
Somebody.

37:30.586 --> 37:31.724
Tat.

37:32.779 --> 37:34.764
I should throw them all away, really.

37:36.753 --> 37:37.793
Win...

37:38.024 --> 37:39.332
I won't be late.

37:39.333 --> 37:40.684
No...

37:43.333 --> 37:45.104
...all right.

38:16.886 --> 38:19.886
And I found this in the grate.
I mean, there's not much left.

38:19.911 --> 38:20.911
Looks like it's been burned.

38:20.936 --> 38:22.936
But to me, it looks like a
Happy Families card.

38:23.684 --> 38:25.304
Not that again?

38:25.329 --> 38:27.849
The letter sent to Farmer Bell
did have an Oxford postmark.

38:28.373 --> 38:31.012
You know how many
Happy Family cards are out there?

38:31.013 --> 38:33.644
Tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands.

38:33.669 --> 38:34.669
What's this?

38:35.333 --> 38:37.184
That sudden I sent him on at Hescott.

38:37.209 --> 38:39.209
Suicide. Fella called Bura.
Morse has got it into his head

38:39.733 --> 38:42.348
he's something to do with
what happened to Creswell.

38:42.373 --> 38:45.332
The vet, Shepherd,
said he knew Sarah Clamp

38:45.333 --> 38:48.532
through a cousin of hers at
Upper Pembury, who's now at Oxford.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.564
The family had a Pekingese
he used to treat.

38:50.760 --> 38:54.204
There's a photograph on Bura's desk
of him with a woman and a Pekingese.

38:55.633 --> 38:56.884
So, who's this Sarah Clamp?

38:57.333 --> 39:01.332
Daughter of the village greengrocer.
She's set to marry Rupert Creswell.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.564
Anything untoward about Bura's suicide?

39:03.589 --> 39:05.044
Not according to Doctor DeBryn.

39:05.333 --> 39:08.362
I spoke to a Rhodes scholar that
Bura played rugby with,

39:08.363 --> 39:11.332
name of Clinton. He said Rufus
kept himself to himself.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.624
No girlfriend that we know off.

39:12.649 --> 39:15.649
You've got a call
from that local yokel. Potter.

39:16.233 --> 39:17.270
Excuse me.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.160
All typed, standard paper,
Oxford postmark.

39:50.185 --> 39:53.185
Always a second class stamp.
And all from "A Well-wisher".

39:53.333 --> 39:54.843
As I said, I sent 'em off
for fingerprinting

39:54.844 --> 39:56.332
after the first few come through.

39:56.333 --> 39:58.332
And, anything?

39:58.333 --> 39:59.864
No, nothing on them,
bar those they were sent to

39:59.865 --> 40:03.704
and anyone they'd shown 'em to.
And John, of course.

40:03.729 --> 40:05.729
Rich asked my advice.

40:06.333 --> 40:09.094
Trying to nail down where
they went into the postal system.

40:09.119 --> 40:10.159
Any luck?

40:10.184 --> 40:12.308
We narrowed it down
to a few boxes in Oxford,

40:12.333 --> 40:14.808
but never the same box twice.

40:14.809 --> 40:16.755
And never the same day two weeks running.

40:16.756 --> 40:19.524
Yeah, we even kept a watch on one or
two of the post boxes for a bit,

40:19.846 --> 40:22.886
on our own time,
but we never saw who posted 'em.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.852
Poor old Rufus.

40:27.853 --> 40:29.444
Did he come to the village much?

40:29.586 --> 40:32.884
Yeah, before he went to Oxford.
Not that he was too well-liked.

40:33.227 --> 40:35.444
Little Lord Fauntleroy,
the lads used to call him.

40:35.900 --> 40:36.900
Seems a bit cruel.

40:37.200 --> 40:42.764
Well, people are. He'd been a bit of
a cry-baby at school. Tell-tale-tit.

40:43.033 --> 40:47.033
Always had his nose
stuck in some book or another.

40:47.058 --> 40:50.058
But he'd drop by to see Sarah regular.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.772
Bit lonely, I expect.

40:51.797 --> 40:54.797
Now, you and Mandy-Jane Bell,

40:55.333 --> 40:58.532
I believe you were... something?

40:58.533 --> 41:00.333
Where d'you hear that?

41:02.826 --> 41:03.826
Yeah, for a bit.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.332
Did Bell know?

41:07.333 --> 41:08.693
Not unless she told him.

41:09.646 --> 41:11.393
Look, it was years ago. We were kids.

41:11.418 --> 41:12.526
That's why I didn't mention it.

41:12.913 --> 41:15.684
Far as I was concerned,
it was all water under the bridge.

41:16.113 --> 41:17.684
No hard feelings?

41:18.060 --> 41:22.900
I knew I was just a distraction
for her. Easy come, easy go.

41:25.220 --> 41:26.324
All right.

41:40.052 --> 41:41.124
Mrs Clamp?

41:42.724 --> 41:45.524
Hello, I'm Detective Sergeant Morse.
Thames Valley.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.900
It's all right, Cec, police.

41:49.804 --> 41:53.332
It's about your nephew, Rufus Bura.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.373
Rufus? What about him?

41:56.953 --> 41:59.953
Rufus was found dead this morning,
at Hescott College.

42:00.524 --> 42:02.004
Dead?

42:02.333 --> 42:05.333
Well, it would appear
that he has taken his own life.

42:09.333 --> 42:12.689
Now, of course, we'll notify
our colleagues in Australia,

42:12.690 --> 42:14.602
but I thought your sister
might prefer to hear it from you.

42:14.603 --> 42:18.303
Oh, poor Brenda,
this will break her heart.

42:18.304 --> 42:20.423
When did you see him last?

42:20.424 --> 42:23.332
Easter. He come by for Easter.

42:23.333 --> 42:27.012
But I spoke to him every week
more or less.

42:27.013 --> 42:28.764
Sunday, he calls.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.471
Him and Sarah have always been
very close, you see.

42:31.496 --> 42:37.265
And since Brenda went abroad...
Well, we're his only family near.

42:37.290 --> 42:39.864
The last time you spoke
to him, how did he seem?

42:39.889 --> 42:41.609
Anything troubling him?

42:41.653 --> 42:42.738
Nothing on his mind?

42:42.739 --> 42:45.044
- Normal. Same as ever.
- Right.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.764
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Of course.

42:50.604 --> 42:52.904
Will you excuse me?
I'd better call Brenda.

42:52.929 --> 42:54.684
Of course. My condolences.

43:14.606 --> 43:16.086
Hello.

43:16.739 --> 43:17.739
Oh, hello.

43:20.159 --> 43:22.519
I didn't think I'd see you again
after Bell's farm.

43:22.544 --> 43:25.184
I've just been over to see
Mrs Clamp, the green grocer.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.084
It's about her nephew.

43:27.853 --> 43:29.332
Rufus?

43:29.333 --> 43:30.568
Do you know him?

43:30.569 --> 43:34.333
He came into the surgery
once in while with his dog. Why?

43:35.867 --> 43:38.227
It's about the poison pen letters.

43:39.364 --> 43:41.164
Henry, go and sit on the blanket.

43:45.273 --> 43:47.244
I don't suppose you or your father
have received any?

43:48.593 --> 43:50.593
Someone sent one to my neighbour,
Miss Neal.

43:51.333 --> 43:52.684
Miss Neal?

43:53.333 --> 43:55.844
Miss Neal who works at Creswell's?

43:55.869 --> 43:57.964
In the personnel department,
that's right.

43:58.959 --> 44:01.514
So, it wasn't to me, as such, but, erm...

44:01.539 --> 44:02.884
But it was about you?

44:08.533 --> 44:10.804
"Miss Pett, the vet's daughter."

44:12.606 --> 44:16.086
If you were to ask my father
about Henry and me,

44:16.684 --> 44:18.644
he'll tell you that I was widowed.

44:19.333 --> 44:20.644
Death.

44:21.333 --> 44:25.764
That's respectable, you see.
No awkward questions.

44:26.919 --> 44:28.919
No shame.

44:28.944 --> 44:30.724
The truth is, erm...

44:31.993 --> 44:35.993
my husband left me
when Henry was quite small.

44:36.804 --> 44:38.324
For another woman.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.764
And that's what it said in the letter?

44:42.220 --> 44:44.084
I can give it to you verbatim,
if you like.

44:44.659 --> 44:46.979
"Mrs Fairford's husband
is alive and well,

44:47.004 --> 44:49.364
"and driving a taxi in Upper Pembury."

44:49.693 --> 44:51.684
Miss Neal thought I should know.

44:52.333 --> 44:54.404
Wasn't that kind of her?

44:56.373 --> 44:57.404
So, there.

44:57.833 --> 44:59.124
Another woman.

45:00.333 --> 45:02.364
How awful must I be?

45:04.213 --> 45:05.844
I don't think you're awful at all.

45:14.613 --> 45:16.724
Look, I'm not in the habit
of doing this, but, uh...

45:18.804 --> 45:21.333
would you
like to go for a drink this evening?

45:22.306 --> 45:23.306
With me?

45:26.639 --> 45:28.364
Er, yes.

45:53.688 --> 45:56.382
- SOBBING
- There.

45:58.041 --> 45:59.201
Bucephalus.

45:59.342 --> 46:00.888
Greville's horse that went lame.

46:01.524 --> 46:03.688
Nothing to be done, I'm afraid.

46:04.084 --> 46:05.687
You'd better take her back to the house.

46:05.688 --> 46:08.164
- Give her a drink or something.
- Of course.

46:12.444 --> 46:13.728
Mum telephoned.

46:14.970 --> 46:16.894
Suicide, she said.

46:17.164 --> 46:19.688
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.

46:20.284 --> 46:23.084
Can you think of anything that would
have prompted Rufus to kill himself?

46:25.148 --> 46:26.348
Nothing.

46:27.688 --> 46:30.688
He was a lovely boy.
I was enormously fond of him.

46:32.484 --> 46:36.688
We were more like brother and sister
than cousins, I suppose.

46:37.884 --> 46:40.688
And he knew the village well?

46:41.164 --> 46:44.762
He was here at least as much
as he was in Upper Pembury. Why?

46:44.763 --> 46:47.889
Oh, just... something I'm looking at.

46:50.056 --> 46:51.527
I believe your mother was
the first to receive

46:51.528 --> 46:53.687
one of these letters that have
been doing the rounds.

46:53.688 --> 46:55.527
- The hate mail?
- Mm-hm.

46:55.528 --> 46:57.977
Yes, about Mister Carraway,
the fishmonger.

46:58.484 --> 47:00.688
Absolute nonsense, of course.

47:01.169 --> 47:04.368
And you worked at Creswell's.
In the personnel department?

47:04.369 --> 47:07.244
- Yes. That's how I met Rupert.
- Right.

47:08.684 --> 47:11.689
And what can you tell me
about Mandy-Jane Bell?

47:12.164 --> 47:14.684
You had a bit of a disagreement,
I understand.

47:15.169 --> 47:17.644
At the work's Christmas party?

47:17.935 --> 47:21.935
That was nothing.
She'd just had too much to drink.

47:23.129 --> 47:27.204
I'm not, if you're wondering,
a gold-digger.

47:28.364 --> 47:32.169
If you'll excuse me,
I told Mum I'd be round.

48:11.169 --> 48:14.024
Isla won't be a moment.
Can I offer you a drink?

48:14.049 --> 48:15.569
I won't, but thank you.

48:15.594 --> 48:18.074
I'm just taking five minutes
with the crossword

48:18.099 --> 48:20.939
before we settle down
to an evening of Snap!

48:21.009 --> 48:22.169
Happy Families?

48:22.857 --> 48:24.742
He collects them. All the kids do.

48:25.364 --> 48:29.169
"Slaughter horse and worry about it."

48:30.284 --> 48:32.168
- Crossword clue. I don't suppose...?
- Carnage.

48:32.169 --> 48:35.168
- Is it seven letters?
- Of course, it is.

48:35.169 --> 48:37.168
Carnage.

48:37.169 --> 48:39.168
- Sorry to have kept you.
- Not at all.

48:39.169 --> 48:41.168
He's been helping me with the crossword.

48:41.169 --> 48:45.169
Has he? Well, now I'm going
to save him. Shall we?

48:45.295 --> 48:46.495
Yes, well, goodnight.

48:46.804 --> 48:48.484
Night, Henry.

49:06.169 --> 49:07.564
Home?

49:20.169 --> 49:23.168
- Chief Superintendent.
- Doctor, very good of you to meet me.

49:23.169 --> 49:25.369
- Not at all. Please.
- Thank you.

49:27.056 --> 49:29.056
What may I get for you?

49:29.169 --> 49:32.168
Oh, er... a brandy, I think.

49:32.169 --> 49:35.169
Albert, a brandy, if you would.

49:39.169 --> 49:41.445
They do quite a decent spot of supper.

49:41.446 --> 49:43.804
Excellent. Excellent, I'm sure.

49:48.369 --> 49:51.604
Now, how may I be of service?

49:53.169 --> 49:56.644
I may rely on your discretion
as a medical man.

49:57.676 --> 50:02.836
Oh, always. Please, speak freely.

50:09.169 --> 50:14.169
My wife has been diagnosed
with cancer of the lungs.

50:15.169 --> 50:18.169
Inoperable, according to the specialist.

50:19.169 --> 50:22.848
She's scolded me for an optimistic fool,

50:22.849 --> 50:27.168
but I wonder if you can recommend
anyone from whom one might seek

50:27.169 --> 50:28.444
a second opinion?

50:29.844 --> 50:34.169
Well, there's no better man in
England than Sir Julian Fitzalan.

50:34.604 --> 50:38.484
I know him slightly,
I would be happy to...

50:44.276 --> 50:46.276
Chief Superintendent?

50:56.844 --> 50:59.369
Julian is my wife's specialist.

51:03.942 --> 51:05.942
He's not infallible, of course.

51:08.169 --> 51:10.169
You're very good to say so.

51:13.169 --> 51:15.169
What is the prognosis?

51:15.684 --> 51:17.849
Months, weeks, perhaps.

51:18.324 --> 51:20.324
It's quite advanced, I understand.

51:22.949 --> 51:24.789
They say the, erm...

51:28.564 --> 51:31.524
...they say the drugs will control
the worst of the pain.

51:34.043 --> 51:36.043
I'll make inquiries, of course.

51:36.684 --> 51:43.644
But my advice would be to make the
most of the time you have together.

52:31.169 --> 52:35.169
I'm sorry if I seem nervous.
I'm... out of practice.

52:36.954 --> 52:38.168
You must think me very parochial.

52:38.169 --> 52:42.168
No, not at all. In fact,
I grew up somewhere just like this.

52:42.169 --> 52:43.604
Really?

52:47.209 --> 52:51.169
Look, about earlier,
I made a bit of a fool of myself.

52:51.564 --> 52:52.604
Oh?

52:52.883 --> 52:54.883
Someone was bound to tell you.

52:56.169 --> 52:58.169
It's just, erm...

52:59.829 --> 53:01.989
I wouldn't want you to...

53:04.802 --> 53:07.802
It's important to tell the truth.
Be honest.

53:08.644 --> 53:10.524
I'm through with lies.

53:16.169 --> 53:19.350
You're... you don't have someone?
In town or...?

53:19.375 --> 53:26.169
Oh, no. No. No.
It's been... a year, almost.

53:27.284 --> 53:29.926
What happened? Sorry, I shouldn't ask.

53:29.951 --> 53:32.284
No. No, erm, what happened...?

53:33.009 --> 53:37.849
She decided that a war
was preferable to my company.

53:39.764 --> 53:43.169
Which probably tells you
all you need to know about me.

53:45.169 --> 53:48.169
She was a photo-journalist. Vietnam.

53:49.169 --> 53:51.284
Afraid I can't compete with that.

53:51.689 --> 53:53.369
It's not a competition.

53:53.684 --> 53:55.169
Really, I'm very dull.

53:55.964 --> 53:57.529
No, you're not.

54:03.169 --> 54:05.169
I think Henry's a very lucky little boy.

54:05.964 --> 54:07.168
He's my world.

54:07.169 --> 54:09.644
Yeah, that's obvious to anyone
who sees you both together.

54:11.164 --> 54:13.169
It doesn't put you off?

54:13.844 --> 54:16.168
Most men would run a million miles
from a single woman

54:16.169 --> 54:18.169
with a kiddie in tow.

54:19.124 --> 54:20.724
More fool them.

54:32.169 --> 54:35.168
Look, I've kept quiet, Ru,
but Pa was right.

54:35.169 --> 54:37.368
You don't really know this girl
from Adam.

54:37.369 --> 54:39.168
What the hell does that mean?

54:39.169 --> 54:42.168
You think I'm going to have some
village girl sitting on the board?

54:42.169 --> 54:44.804
She worked in the factory for God's sake!

54:47.863 --> 54:49.863
She might have been raised
in the village,

54:50.169 --> 54:53.168
but at least she's the manners to
know one doesn't listen at keyholes,

54:53.169 --> 54:55.168
unlike your brood-mare!

54:55.169 --> 54:58.169
Excuse me, Clemmie, won't you?

55:03.364 --> 55:04.884
Here we are.

55:12.689 --> 55:18.168
I, erm,
I would ask you in... I'd like to.

55:18.169 --> 55:22.169
Really, I want to. It's just...
It's just with Henry.

55:23.169 --> 55:26.689
That's all right.
I wasn't expecting you to.

55:26.941 --> 55:28.421
You hardly know me.

55:28.446 --> 55:30.169
It doesn't feel like that.

55:32.649 --> 55:33.689
Is that mad?

55:38.169 --> 55:40.169
Love should be brave, don't you think?

55:41.484 --> 55:43.524
Even if it doesn't last.

56:02.524 --> 56:04.084
You should go inside.

56:05.169 --> 56:06.849
I'll telephone.

56:39.849 --> 56:42.169
I'll be back later, Clemmie.

57:04.868 --> 57:08.067
Stone me, matey.
This what it's come to, has it?

57:08.068 --> 57:11.404
I was just getting 40 winks.

57:12.284 --> 57:14.228
Called in at the Section House.

57:18.382 --> 57:20.868
DeBryn said you went to the post mortem.

57:21.284 --> 57:22.868
Thank you.

57:23.444 --> 57:25.867
Any progress on the overdoses?

57:25.868 --> 57:27.284
No.

57:28.868 --> 57:30.547
You wonder why that is?

57:30.548 --> 57:33.867
It's not my case.
Box has put the DI and Jago on it.

57:33.868 --> 57:37.868
Same question. You wonder why that is?

57:39.868 --> 57:40.868
What're you saying?

57:40.869 --> 57:43.385
I'm saying, if Box's investigation

57:43.386 --> 57:46.547
into who's keeping Oxford supplied
with heroin cut with quinine

57:46.548 --> 57:49.244
has stalled,
maybe there's a reason for it.

57:50.601 --> 57:53.883
You want to crack this thing,
it's down to us.

57:54.884 --> 57:57.388
I told you, there is no us.

57:58.004 --> 58:00.867
I'm just gonna keep my head down,
my nose clean,

58:00.868 --> 58:02.530
and wait for the winds to change.

58:02.531 --> 58:04.868
Since when do you value your neck
so high?

58:05.164 --> 58:06.868
Well, I met someone.

58:07.124 --> 58:08.708
Oh, yeah?

58:09.044 --> 58:11.868
She's got a little boy. Five years old.

58:12.404 --> 58:14.868
I dunno, it could be something.

58:16.644 --> 58:17.868
What?

58:18.868 --> 58:23.227
Everyone else deserves a chance...
why should I be so different?

58:23.228 --> 58:25.868
- Because you are.
- What if I don't want to be?

58:26.204 --> 58:28.044
I mean, that's what it's about, isn't it?

58:29.084 --> 58:31.044
Having someone to come home to.

58:31.868 --> 58:33.868
I wouldn't know.

58:37.204 --> 58:38.708
Look...

58:41.868 --> 58:43.868
...just watch your back here.

58:44.924 --> 58:46.404
For old time's sake.

58:55.204 --> 58:58.868
I mean it. Trust no bugger.

58:59.324 --> 59:01.068
Even your closest.

59:02.868 --> 59:03.908
Be seeing you.

59:17.868 --> 59:19.244
There you go.

59:24.204 --> 59:25.387
What's this?

59:25.388 --> 59:27.244
I told you, I look after my firm.

59:28.884 --> 59:30.907
And what have I done
to warrant looking after?

59:30.908 --> 59:32.867
Don't take it that way.

59:32.868 --> 59:35.707
You'd have been taken care of
before now, I'd had my way.

59:35.708 --> 59:37.404
Just needed to be sure of you.

59:38.204 --> 59:39.868
And now you are?

59:40.684 --> 59:44.404
I think so. I'd hate to be wrong.

59:46.680 --> 59:50.200
Listen... it's all above board.

59:50.804 --> 59:52.524
Just a bit of bunce.

59:54.868 --> 59:59.062
This more of what Jago
was picking up last week? For what?

59:59.063 --> 01:00:01.068
What a man don't know can't hurt him.

01:00:01.724 --> 01:00:04.868
If we're square,
there's more where that came from.

01:00:06.761 --> 01:00:09.044
I'll fill you in as
to the rest of it as time goes by.

01:00:14.868 --> 01:00:18.868
You're a good man, Fred.
Same as my old man.

01:00:19.764 --> 01:00:22.868
He did nearly 30 years in a blue uniform.

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:24.707
Two months shy of his pension,

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.067
going after a couple of safe-crackers,

01:00:26.068 --> 01:00:27.868
he went through a skylight.

01:00:28.404 --> 01:00:30.868
Fell 35 feet on
the concrete and broke his back.

01:00:31.247 --> 01:00:33.247
Know what he got for his trouble?

01:00:38.124 --> 01:00:40.868
A watch and a chain.

01:00:43.388 --> 01:00:45.868
The watch stopped working
after a fortnight.

01:00:46.884 --> 01:00:48.868
And six months later, so did he.

01:00:52.556 --> 01:00:55.867
I swore on his grave, if I was
going to risk my life for this job,

01:00:55.868 --> 01:00:58.868
I was going to get more out of it
than just a poxy watch and chain.

01:00:59.524 --> 01:01:01.068
You deserve no different.

01:01:08.204 --> 01:01:09.867
Deserve?

01:01:09.868 --> 01:01:11.868
After the way they've treated you?

01:01:12.404 --> 01:01:13.868
I wouldn't treat a dog like that.

01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:16.867
Christ, you must've noticed
a change in your pay-packet?

01:01:16.868 --> 01:01:18.324
What's next?

01:01:18.614 --> 01:01:21.614
They put you out to grass
on some nothing job like old Rich?

01:01:22.484 --> 01:01:24.868
A man's got his dignity, Fred...

01:01:25.964 --> 01:01:27.068
or he's got nothing.

01:01:30.444 --> 01:01:32.868
Doesn't make you a bad copper.

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.388
Just makes you a smart one.

01:01:38.804 --> 01:01:39.764
Go on.

01:01:41.124 --> 01:01:43.068
Take the missus out this weekend.

01:01:44.084 --> 01:01:45.228
Treat her.

01:01:55.994 --> 01:01:57.994
Blimey...

01:01:59.127 --> 01:02:02.127
For a minute there, you had me
giving you two-bob, thrupenny bit.

01:02:04.244 --> 01:02:05.868
You and me both.

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:08.868
To be fair,
I was no different the first time.

01:02:09.604 --> 01:02:11.868
Second time, you barely feel it.

01:02:12.484 --> 01:02:16.868
After that... it's all gravy.

01:02:22.868 --> 01:02:23.884
Go on, then.

01:02:25.364 --> 01:02:26.868
Get 'em in.

01:03:12.524 --> 01:03:14.868
Morning, darling.

01:03:15.804 --> 01:03:16.868
Clemmie.

01:03:17.564 --> 01:03:18.867
Murray not down yet?

01:03:18.868 --> 01:03:20.387
I thought he must be with you?

01:03:20.388 --> 01:03:23.204
No. What time did he get back last night?

01:03:24.244 --> 01:03:27.708
I don't know. He didn't come into me.

01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:32.124
I'll, erm... go and knock.

01:03:54.868 --> 01:03:56.391
I don't think he's been home.

01:03:56.392 --> 01:03:58.867
What? No, that can't be right.

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:00.908
I'm pretty sure his bed
hasn't been slept in.

01:04:01.284 --> 01:04:02.867
Oh, my God.

01:04:02.868 --> 01:04:05.868
It doesn't mean anything.
Maybe his car wouldn't start.

01:04:08.868 --> 01:04:10.658
No reply. I'll drive over there.

01:04:10.659 --> 01:04:12.867
- I'll come with you.
- It's best you wait here,

01:04:12.868 --> 01:04:15.704
- just in case I miss him. Sarah?
- Yes, of course.

01:04:15.705 --> 01:04:17.868
Try not to worry, Clemmie.

01:04:35.294 --> 01:04:36.294
Murray?!

01:04:37.868 --> 01:04:38.868
Not in the office?

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:41.868
No. There's not a sign of...

01:04:43.524 --> 01:04:44.868
Call the police.

01:04:46.574 --> 01:04:48.214
Call the police!

01:05:11.868 --> 01:05:13.867
What've we got, Doctor?

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:16.868
He died sometime between
nine and midnight.

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:20.867
I won't be able to confirm cause
until I've got his lid off.

01:05:20.868 --> 01:05:23.707
But as far as injuries are concerned...

01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:27.867
A single circular wound
about half an inch diameter

01:05:27.868 --> 01:05:29.249
to the base of the skull.

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.663
Shot, then, surely?

01:05:30.664 --> 01:05:32.387
No, there's no starburst pattern,

01:05:32.388 --> 01:05:34.867
which one would expect to find from
a discharge at point blank range.

01:05:34.868 --> 01:05:36.513
Yes, quite.

01:05:36.514 --> 01:05:38.904
Could have been done with any
number of pointed instruments.

01:05:38.929 --> 01:05:39.973
Such as?

01:05:39.974 --> 01:05:41.867
Oh, a spiked bayonet,

01:05:41.868 --> 01:05:44.360
medieval misericord,

01:05:44.361 --> 01:05:48.164
rondel dagger, the Japanese sai.

01:05:48.684 --> 01:05:52.867
The only thing one can pronounce
with any certainty at this juncture

01:05:52.868 --> 01:05:55.868
is that he came to a sticky end.

01:05:56.404 --> 01:05:58.004
Shall we say two o'clock?

01:06:08.174 --> 01:06:09.654
What?

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.054
That's not a bullet wound.

01:06:23.004 --> 01:06:24.867
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

01:06:24.868 --> 01:06:26.445
What can I do for you?

01:06:26.446 --> 01:06:28.388
It's about Murray Creswell.

01:06:28.724 --> 01:06:29.868
Ah...

01:06:30.364 --> 01:06:32.867
"Ah", what? What's this?

01:06:32.868 --> 01:06:34.867
I was gonna tell you. It's, uh...

01:06:34.868 --> 01:06:36.868
He's been found dead up at the factory.

01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:38.867
No...

01:06:38.868 --> 01:06:41.324
I'm so sorry, my dear.
It's all round the village.

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:44.868
Would you...

01:06:46.325 --> 01:06:47.720
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.745 --> 01:06:49.868
Please, excuse me. I must see to Henry.

01:06:51.068 --> 01:06:54.867
Isla used to ride to hounds with the
Chigton Hunt when she was younger.

01:06:54.868 --> 01:06:56.388
Very nice.

01:06:56.389 --> 01:07:00.867
She was good friends with Clemmie
and Murray until Henry came along.

01:07:00.868 --> 01:07:02.867
Oh, he's a darling boy,

01:07:02.868 --> 01:07:06.548
but children can put a brake
upon one's social life.

01:07:08.548 --> 01:07:11.868
So, what can I do for you?

01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:14.684
Morse says you've got a horse gun.

01:07:17.228 --> 01:07:18.868
Pa.

01:07:21.347 --> 01:07:23.347
Now Murray.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.868
I feel like I'm going mad.

01:07:27.604 --> 01:07:31.068
Can you think of anyone
who wished your brother ill?

01:07:31.764 --> 01:07:35.204
No. Murray really was
the best of fellows.

01:07:36.868 --> 01:07:39.867
I know he was my big brother
and it's often the way,

01:07:39.868 --> 01:07:41.867
but I've looked up to him all my life.

01:07:41.868 --> 01:07:43.867
I'm sorry, Ru.

01:07:43.868 --> 01:07:48.451
Are you sure he didn't receive
any of these poison pen letters?

01:07:48.924 --> 01:07:50.868
Not as far as I'm aware.

01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:53.141
You've guns up at the house, presumably.

01:07:53.604 --> 01:07:55.867
Shotguns, certainly.

01:07:55.868 --> 01:07:57.547
You did this! Mrs Creswell...

01:07:57.548 --> 01:07:58.668
You killed him!

01:07:58.693 --> 01:08:00.247
- Clemmie...
- You killed him! Mrs Creswell...

01:08:00.248 --> 01:08:01.867
Half the business wasn't enough for you!

01:08:01.868 --> 01:08:04.387
You wanted it all,
so you could sell it to Gidbury's!

01:08:04.388 --> 01:08:06.026
- Clemmie!
- You're in on it, too.

01:08:06.051 --> 01:08:07.051
Don't think I don't know.

01:08:07.052 --> 01:08:08.867
You're in on it together! Both of you!

01:08:08.868 --> 01:08:11.227
They're murderers! Murderers!
Well, don't just stand there!

01:08:11.228 --> 01:08:14.868
- Arrest them...
- Stop it! Pull yourself together!

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:18.127
Look, Clemmie, you've had a shock.

01:08:18.644 --> 01:08:20.867
We all have. But it's not helping anybody

01:08:20.868 --> 01:08:22.867
to tear at one another like this.

01:08:22.868 --> 01:08:26.484
Let's just go outside for a bit,
Mrs Creswell, get some air.

01:08:34.827 --> 01:08:37.163
I keep it locked in this box here.

01:08:47.233 --> 01:08:48.553
Oh, good heavens.

01:08:50.404 --> 01:08:51.604
It's gone.

01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:55.707
I could have sworn I put it back.

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:56.867
When did you see it last?

01:08:56.868 --> 01:08:59.867
At Creswell Hall.
When I put down Bucephalus.

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:03.112
- You've had no cause to use it since?
- No.

01:09:03.113 --> 01:09:05.867
And you locked it back away
once you were done?

01:09:05.868 --> 01:09:08.868
Yes, I thought I had. But, erm...

01:09:09.363 --> 01:09:12.421
Well, I suppose anyone could get
into the car when I'm out on call.

01:09:12.423 --> 01:09:14.283
I don't leave it locked.

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:24.385
When did you last see your husband?

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.385
Yesterday evening.

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.425
Around ten.

01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:36.179
He said he had business to attend to
at the factory.

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:39.425
Did he give you any indication as
to what the business might be?

01:09:42.162 --> 01:09:44.064
We were having supper.

01:09:45.385 --> 01:09:48.385
Me, Murray and Rupert.

01:09:50.671 --> 01:09:52.804
Just after nine, the telephone rang.

01:09:53.844 --> 01:09:55.585
Murray went to answer it.

01:09:56.244 --> 01:09:58.385
Did he say who it was?

01:10:00.385 --> 01:10:01.745
No.

01:10:03.298 --> 01:10:05.298
But when we were alone
in the drawing room later,

01:10:05.323 --> 01:10:08.323
he said he had to go out for a while.

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:13.045
I assumed it was something
to do with work.

01:10:13.445 --> 01:10:14.605
So...

01:10:15.804 --> 01:10:17.604
...he left at around ten-ish.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:19.564
Then what?

01:10:20.225 --> 01:10:23.385
Sarah turned up at about
eleven o'clock to see Rupert.

01:10:25.724 --> 01:10:28.065
I left them to it and went to bed.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:31.385
You didn't miss your husband?

01:10:31.924 --> 01:10:33.385
Not until this morning.

01:10:36.385 --> 01:10:38.385
We have separate rooms.

01:10:40.385 --> 01:10:42.384
And what about yesterday evening?

01:10:42.385 --> 01:10:45.384
A call did come through last night
about ten past nine.

01:10:45.385 --> 01:10:47.385
Just after you brought Isla back
from the pub.

01:10:48.724 --> 01:10:51.584
It was a bad line, but the caller
said he had a cow in labour

01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:53.384
and it looked to be a breech delivery.

01:10:53.385 --> 01:10:55.424
And where was that?

01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:58.384
He said they were calling from
Foxtail Grange,

01:10:58.385 --> 01:11:00.384
somewhere out towards King's Abbot.

01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:02.384
It didn't ring a bell,
I drove out there anyway.

01:11:02.385 --> 01:11:04.384
Couldn't find the place
for love nor money.

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:07.384
I did try calling Isla just in
case she'd taken it down wrong.

01:11:07.385 --> 01:11:09.384
I hadn't. I don't make mistakes.

01:11:09.385 --> 01:11:11.384
Not when it comes to practice business.

01:11:11.385 --> 01:11:14.424
Anyway, I couldn't get through, so
I ended up driving round and round

01:11:14.425 --> 01:11:16.384
until, eventually, I just gave it up
as a bad job.

01:11:16.385 --> 01:11:18.384
How was it you couldn't get through here?

01:11:18.385 --> 01:11:21.425
My fault, I'm afraid, I was
talking to an old school friend.

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.385
What time did you get back
to the surgery?

01:11:24.844 --> 01:11:26.788
Eleven. Eleven thirty.
Something like that.

01:11:26.789 --> 01:11:27.981
I can confirm that.

01:11:27.982 --> 01:11:30.584
Yes, she was still yakking away
on the telephone.

01:11:30.585 --> 01:11:33.624
The farmer didn't leave a telephone
number when he first rang?

01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:34.642
No.

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:37.224
No, he said he was calling
from a phone box.

01:11:37.225 --> 01:11:40.064
I did offer to take his number
and call him back, but...

01:11:40.065 --> 01:11:41.385
he hung up.

01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:47.384
I'd been in the village
having supper at my parents'.

01:11:47.385 --> 01:11:51.384
Must have left about half past ten,
something like that.

01:11:51.385 --> 01:11:53.384
You went straight to Creswell Hall?

01:11:53.385 --> 01:11:54.584
That's right.

01:11:54.585 --> 01:11:56.768
And once there, you didn't go out again?

01:11:56.769 --> 01:11:58.384
No. Not until this morning.

01:11:58.385 --> 01:12:01.384
And your intended.
He was with you the whole time?

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:02.844
Yes.

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:06.385
He had quite a lot to gain by
his brother's death, didn't he?

01:12:06.604 --> 01:12:08.324
Rupert loved Murray.

01:12:09.764 --> 01:12:11.385
There's more to life than money.

01:12:11.804 --> 01:12:15.684
You know who thinks like that,
Miss Clamp? The rich.

01:12:16.225 --> 01:12:17.844
I'm not rich.

01:12:18.385 --> 01:12:19.764
But you will be.

01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:24.924
You think someone called Shepherd
out on a fool's errand?

01:12:25.385 --> 01:12:27.384
Or he arranged it himself, perhaps.

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:29.384
Keeps him in play for Murray.

01:12:29.385 --> 01:12:31.384
Unless someone's trying to put him
in the frame for it.

01:12:31.385 --> 01:12:33.055
So, where's his horse gun?

01:12:33.056 --> 01:12:36.384
Oh, I don't know. Maybe he did
leave it up at Creswell Hall,

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.384
but he's got no motive
to go after Murray.

01:12:38.385 --> 01:12:40.082
That we know about.

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.384
The exchange should be able to tell you

01:12:41.385 --> 01:12:43.224
what call-box this farmer used.

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.384
I wonder if Murray received
any of these poison pen letters

01:12:45.385 --> 01:12:47.384
- since last we asked?
- Murray Creswell was lured

01:12:47.385 --> 01:12:50.384
to the factory last night
by a telephone call, not any letter.

01:12:50.385 --> 01:12:53.224
Yes, but whoever lured him there
could have received one.

01:12:53.225 --> 01:12:55.384
Like Farmer Bell, you mean?

01:12:55.385 --> 01:12:57.384
Someone primed to go off?

01:12:57.385 --> 01:13:00.014
You think whoever sent these letters
made similar allegations

01:13:00.015 --> 01:13:01.384
about Murray Creswell.

01:13:01.385 --> 01:13:04.584
He'd led a pretty blameless life,
according to his brother.

01:13:04.585 --> 01:13:07.384
Hard to see what he can have done
to make someone kill him.

01:13:07.385 --> 01:13:08.644
True.

01:13:09.065 --> 01:13:12.065
But the village is already half mad
with suspicion and mistrust.

01:13:12.444 --> 01:13:14.064
The right word in the wrong ear

01:13:14.065 --> 01:13:15.724
wouldn't take much to
push someone over the edge.

01:13:55.585 --> 01:13:59.501
What's this? Jago said you were with
Shepherd's daughter in the pub?

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:00.661
It was just a drink.

01:14:00.662 --> 01:14:04.001
She's a suspect.
Christ, what's the matter with you?

01:14:04.002 --> 01:14:05.995
- They bat their lashes...
- I've got a life.

01:14:05.996 --> 01:14:07.918
- Not on duty, you haven't.
- I wasn't on duty.

01:14:07.919 --> 01:14:11.117
It shouldn't matter. A copper's
a copper, first, last and always.

01:14:11.118 --> 01:14:12.385
Where's that got you

01:14:14.844 --> 01:14:16.385
Sir, I...

01:14:17.884 --> 01:14:19.764
Just find the gun.

01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:24.384
- Dear Anxious of Jericho.
- If your friend suffers from BO,

01:15:24.385 --> 01:15:26.384
try to introduce regular bathing

01:15:26.385 --> 01:15:28.744
as a topic into a more general
conversation about health.

01:15:28.745 --> 01:15:32.385
And, no, you cannot get pregnant
through any form of kissing.

01:15:33.084 --> 01:15:38.002
So... you're Miss Ling,
Agony Aunt in the Oxford Mail.

01:15:38.003 --> 01:15:40.905
I trust I may rely on your discretion.

01:15:42.225 --> 01:15:44.745
You must be privy
to a lot of peoples' secrets.

01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:47.384
Are these the only
anonymous letters that you write?

01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:51.384
Am I author of these poison pen letters?

01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:52.804
I am not.

01:15:53.385 --> 01:15:57.584
Though I believe they were also
written on an Adler Favourite Two.

01:15:57.585 --> 01:15:59.385
I recognised the typeface.

01:16:01.392 --> 01:16:03.532
Does anybody else know
that you're Miss Ling?

01:16:03.533 --> 01:16:06.533
Only one other has ever guessed
my identity...

01:16:07.733 --> 01:16:09.573
...and she's dead now.

01:16:10.392 --> 01:16:12.212
Mandy-Jane Bell?

01:16:12.213 --> 01:16:14.532
She used to read my column as a teenager.

01:16:14.533 --> 01:16:18.184
And was always trying to guess
who might have written to me.

01:16:18.185 --> 01:16:21.212
But my correspondents
always used an alias,

01:16:21.213 --> 01:16:25.533
so I couldn't have told her...
even if I'd wanted to.

01:18:42.886 --> 01:18:43.886
Back, are you?

01:18:46.912 --> 01:18:48.533
The phone records have come through.

01:18:49.552 --> 01:18:51.533
We know who called Shepherd.

01:18:52.152 --> 01:18:54.112
Yes, I think I know, too.

01:19:14.177 --> 01:19:18.176
Mr Shepherd. Detective
Inspector Thursday, Thames Valley.

01:19:18.177 --> 01:19:20.176
I believe you know Sergeant Morse.

01:19:20.177 --> 01:19:22.536
Yes, of course.
Any luck with the humane killer?

01:19:22.537 --> 01:19:23.856
Not yet, Mister Shepherd.

01:19:23.857 --> 01:19:26.176
We're hoping your daughter
might be able to help us with that.

01:19:26.177 --> 01:19:27.509
Isla?

01:19:28.177 --> 01:19:32.177
Actually... I believe she's
something to show you. Darling?

01:19:32.929 --> 01:19:34.011
Yes.

01:19:34.445 --> 01:19:38.377
I received a letter this morning.
One of those letters.

01:19:38.909 --> 01:19:40.537
I was going to bring it in.

01:19:43.177 --> 01:19:45.176
"The grocer's daughter
is sleeping with men

01:19:45.177 --> 01:19:47.176
"from half the houses in the village."

01:19:47.177 --> 01:19:48.177
I'm sure she isn't.

01:19:48.178 --> 01:19:50.177
Yeah. I'm sure she's not, too.

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:55.177
The typeface is the same,
but that's not an Oxford post-mark.

01:19:55.869 --> 01:19:58.176
Just as a matter of interest,
Mister Shepherd,

01:19:58.177 --> 01:20:00.177
where did you get your typewriter?

01:20:00.469 --> 01:20:03.177
It was a present for Isla,
from Murray Creswell.

01:20:03.589 --> 01:20:06.176
Our old machine was giving up the ghost.

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:08.177
So he let us have a spare
from the factory.

01:20:08.909 --> 01:20:10.176
When was this?

01:20:10.177 --> 01:20:11.591
Last summer. Why?

01:20:12.329 --> 01:20:13.650
Because for the last nine months,

01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:15.537
your daughter's been using it
to type poison pen letters.

01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:18.176
I don't believe you.

01:20:18.177 --> 01:20:21.177
That's insane.
Why would she do such a thing?

01:20:21.909 --> 01:20:25.176
That scene at the work's Christmas
party with Mandy-Jane Bell

01:20:25.177 --> 01:20:28.176
calling Sarah Clamp a gold-digger,
that was only half the story?

01:20:28.177 --> 01:20:33.177
She also told Murray Creswell she
suspected he was your son's father.

01:20:34.815 --> 01:20:36.176
Where would she get that idea?

01:20:36.177 --> 01:20:37.749
The Oxford Mail.

01:20:38.177 --> 01:20:40.177
Miss Ling's Problem Page, to be precise.

01:20:41.029 --> 01:20:44.176
Mandy-Jane Bell had an appetite
for other people's misery.

01:20:44.177 --> 01:20:46.176
In fact, one letter so took her fancy

01:20:46.177 --> 01:20:47.376
that she pinned it to her noticeboard,

01:20:47.377 --> 01:20:51.177
until she could work out just whom
'Worried of Upper Pembury' could be.

01:20:51.862 --> 01:20:53.409
The clues were all there.

01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:56.409
Adulterous wife. Rich, married lover.

01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:58.761
But the most telling
was Miss Ling's reply.

01:20:58.762 --> 01:21:01.948
She told the wife she should
pass herself off as a widow

01:21:01.949 --> 01:21:03.409
because, how did it go, Sergeant?

01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:05.992
Because "Death is infinitely
more respectable than adultery,

01:21:05.993 --> 01:21:08.410
"it comes with fewer awkward questions."

01:21:12.922 --> 01:21:15.604
Who told you your secret was out,
Mrs Fairford?

01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:19.604
Murray Creswell or Mandy-Jane Bell?

01:21:22.117 --> 01:21:23.637
Murray.

01:21:24.604 --> 01:21:26.334
That's why the little bitch
approached him

01:21:26.335 --> 01:21:27.604
at the Christmas do.

01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:30.604
Money? That what she was after?

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:33.822
He gave her a few bob.

01:21:34.284 --> 01:21:38.047
But I knew that wouldn't be enough
for a girl like Mandy-Jane.

01:21:38.048 --> 01:21:40.603
So, you started
your little hate mail campaign,

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:43.016
knowing that sooner or later
you could slip in a letter

01:21:43.017 --> 01:21:46.603
to Rennett Bell in amongst all the
other misery that you'd stirred up.

01:21:46.604 --> 01:21:50.604
What where you hoping for? That Bell
would just give her a good hiding?

01:21:51.182 --> 01:21:53.662
Chuck her out, maybe,
same as what happened to you?

01:21:54.444 --> 01:21:55.604
Maybe.

01:21:56.142 --> 01:21:59.644
None of them are any better.
They have all got something to hide.

01:22:00.662 --> 01:22:02.022
Gossip.

01:22:02.604 --> 01:22:04.603
I have had to live with it.

01:22:04.604 --> 01:22:08.422
The looks. The sly stares.
People looking down their noses.

01:22:09.604 --> 01:22:11.062
And I had Henry to protect.

01:22:12.644 --> 01:22:16.604
Why should he pay for my mistakes,
grow up with that stigma?

01:22:17.604 --> 01:22:20.603
But you needed an accomplice,
someone outside the village.

01:22:20.604 --> 01:22:22.604
You typed the letters.

01:22:24.604 --> 01:22:26.963
But to avoid suspicion,
posted them to Rufus Bura.

01:22:26.964 --> 01:22:30.604
Who sent them back to Chigton Green
with an Oxford postmark.

01:22:34.161 --> 01:22:37.123
- Why would Rufus do such a thing?
- Because, like your daughter,

01:22:37.124 --> 01:22:39.603
he despised the village
and everyone in it.

01:22:39.604 --> 01:22:43.123
But when your malicious prank ended
in somebody being murdered,

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:45.604
he couldn't face the consequences
of his actions.

01:22:47.144 --> 01:22:48.603
So, Rufus killed himself

01:22:48.604 --> 01:22:51.603
and Rennett Bell shot Mandy-Jane and
Grev Creswell. I didn't kill them.

01:22:51.604 --> 01:22:53.603
No, not directly.

01:22:53.604 --> 01:22:56.142
But the night of
Murray Creswell's murder,

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:59.603
telephone records show
a request from this number

01:22:59.604 --> 01:23:00.782
for a check on the line.

01:23:01.604 --> 01:23:04.462
A woman's voice,
according to the operator.

01:23:05.604 --> 01:23:07.644
Just after nine, would that be right?

01:23:08.662 --> 01:23:11.847
You told your father it was a farmer
calling from, where was it,

01:23:11.848 --> 01:23:13.604
Foxtail Grange?

01:23:17.604 --> 01:23:20.604
But, in fact, having sent him out
on a wild goose chase...

01:23:23.604 --> 01:23:25.603
you telephoned Creswell Hall.

01:23:25.604 --> 01:23:28.604
Told Murray to come and meet you
at the factory.

01:23:29.302 --> 01:23:32.603
And then gave yourself an alibi,
by leaving the phone off the hook,

01:23:32.604 --> 01:23:35.604
so that if anyone called,
they'd get an engaged signal.

01:24:00.516 --> 01:24:05.516
He wanted me to come clean.
For the best, he said.

01:24:06.582 --> 01:24:09.102
He'd see that his child was looked after.

01:24:10.102 --> 01:24:12.124
His child!

01:24:12.862 --> 01:24:15.125
When I fell pregnant,
he didn't want to know.

01:24:15.126 --> 01:24:18.225
And now he was saying I wasn't
a fit mother to raise his child.

01:24:18.226 --> 01:24:20.604
Threatening to take Henry away from me.

01:24:22.902 --> 01:24:25.862
And all so you could pay Mandy-Jane back.

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:29.603
It was wicked what she did.

01:24:29.604 --> 01:24:32.604
Poking her nose
into other people's affairs.

01:24:32.982 --> 01:24:34.662
And you're no different.

01:24:40.964 --> 01:24:45.444
Henry! Let me say goodbye to Henry.
Henry!

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.604
Get off me!

01:24:48.644 --> 01:24:51.603
Henry! Henry!

01:24:51.604 --> 01:24:54.604
Stop, please! Henry!

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:03.542
All right?

01:25:06.604 --> 01:25:08.604
What a place.

01:25:13.604 --> 01:25:14.604
Look...

01:25:16.062 --> 01:25:17.862
Plenty more fish?

01:25:21.604 --> 01:25:23.604
- You can clear up here, can you?
- Yeah.

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:44.925
Morse.

01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:47.603
'Urgent request to attend RTA
on Wells Street.'

01:25:47.604 --> 01:25:50.603
- Oh, no, you want traffic.
- 'This is DS Morse?'

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:53.603
- That's right.
- 'Then it's you he wants.'

01:25:53.604 --> 01:25:56.196
- Who wants?
- 'Chief Superintendent Bright.'

01:25:56.197 --> 01:25:58.604
'Nobody else, he said, just Morse.'

01:25:59.862 --> 01:26:01.342
Right.

01:26:08.072 --> 01:26:09.085
Sir?

01:26:09.086 --> 01:26:11.902
Thank you for coming so quickly,
there's something you need to see.

01:26:12.843 --> 01:26:14.843
The holdall there.

01:26:22.604 --> 01:26:24.409
Who's the driver?

01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:27.443
No identification. Car hired in London.

01:26:27.444 --> 01:26:28.822
So, why me?

01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:30.830
Doctor?

01:26:32.197 --> 01:26:35.251
There's an old spent round
under the driver's seat.

01:26:35.822 --> 01:26:37.603
I can't swear to anything more

01:26:37.604 --> 01:26:41.102
until I've had it under
the comparison microscope, but...

01:26:42.604 --> 01:26:46.124
...it's the same calibre as killed
George Fancy.

01:27:03.604 --> 01:27:05.604
Where's Inspector Thursday?

01:27:50.604 --> 01:27:52.604
