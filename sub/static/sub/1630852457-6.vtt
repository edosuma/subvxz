00:11.636 --> 00:13.596
[helicopter whirring]

00:13.680 --> 00:16.224
[rock music playing]

00:17.308 --> 00:19.477
[soldier 1] Mail call.
Santa's here, fellas!

00:20.103 --> 00:22.105
-Putman!
-[Putnam] Thank you, Sergeant.

00:22.897 --> 00:23.815
Johnny.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.284
Ooh, Johnny, Johnny!

00:35.618 --> 00:39.873
-Man, you weren't kiddin'. She is a beaut!
-All right. Come on. Give it back.

00:39.956 --> 00:43.501
-Hey, Twig, come look at this. [chuckles]
-Do you have to call me that?

00:43.585 --> 00:46.337
Yeah. Get a little muscle
on those tree branches, we'll talk.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.090
-Yeah. He's got a point, Twig.
-Wow. Who's that?

00:49.174 --> 00:51.301
-Johnny's girl back home.
-[Twig] Ooh.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.511
[sniffs] Mmm.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.722
-Smell that perfume?
-Ooh.

00:55.805 --> 00:59.559
Yeah, that's the smell of America.
Tell her to send one for me, would ya?

00:59.642 --> 01:01.728
-[Twig chuckles]
-In your dreams, pal.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.022
-[man] Kreese.
-Yes, Sergeant?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.858
Command tent.
Some captain's in there asking for you.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.402
-[Twig] Uh-oh.
-[soldier 2] Oh, good luck!

01:09.903 --> 01:11.362
[both laugh]

01:11.905 --> 01:13.948
[ominous music plays]

01:16.743 --> 01:18.745
[man grunting]

01:24.459 --> 01:25.877
[thudding]

01:26.878 --> 01:27.796
[grunts]

01:28.880 --> 01:29.964
Captain.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.427
At ease.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.264
[exhales sharply]

01:38.348 --> 01:39.557
So you must be Kreese?

01:40.642 --> 01:44.062
Yeah. Well, your CO tells me
you're a real go-getter.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.314
Volunteerin' to walk point.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.483
joinin' ambush teams.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.569
You got a death wish, kid?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.697
Not wishin' for it, just not afraid of it.

01:55.323 --> 01:58.159
-Is that right?
-Some people can't tell the difference.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.705
You have any idea
how many men we have in this hellhole?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.082
-In 'Nam?
-Yeah.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.252
Probably half a million.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.547
Most of 'em don't make
a damn bit of difference.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.550
But you…

02:15.301 --> 02:16.678
You can make a difference.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.847
-That's why I'm here, sir.
-Mm-hmm.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.056
Defend my country.

02:20.765 --> 02:21.641
Be a hero.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.601
Be a… [laughs]

02:24.602 --> 02:25.603
That's good.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.522
That's good.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.108
'Cause I'm formin' a team.

02:30.191 --> 02:34.195
We'll work out of CCN.
Direct action missions into north Vietnam.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.780
This is the real war.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.074
We'll go sterile
into triple canopy jungle.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.951
No insignias, no ID.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.662
The team will be you, me,
and a few specialists.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.248
-I know a couple guys, sir.
-I'll train you myself.

02:45.331 --> 02:49.252
Guerrilla tactics, demolitions,
hand-to-hand combat.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.504
What kind of hand-to-hand, sir?

02:51.588 --> 02:54.424
You wanna defeat your enemy,
gotta fight like your enemy.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.427
I learned Tang Soo Do
during the Korean War

02:57.510 --> 03:00.471
under Master Kim SunYung.
You'll learn the same.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.100
-If you think you can handle it.
-You're goddamn right I can.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.270
Sir.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.857
All right, you make it through,
you'll get your beret… [laughs]

03:10.940 --> 03:11.941
…a few scars,

03:12.442 --> 03:15.028
maybe even
a battlefield commission to boot.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.946
If I don't make it through?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.949
Well, then you'll show up
on some MIA list in 30 years

03:20.033 --> 03:22.535
when they declassify all this shit.

03:22.619 --> 03:26.873
[spits] I'm asking you to become more
than just a soldier, son. Understand that?

03:28.291 --> 03:29.918
If we're gonna do this,

03:30.627 --> 03:32.170
we need the absolute best.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.590
[rock music playing]

03:35.673 --> 03:37.592
Yeah! Whoo!

03:37.675 --> 03:39.052
[captain] We need strength.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.178
Yes!

03:41.888 --> 03:44.307
-[captain] We need determination.
-[girl] What?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.518
[captain] We need brutality.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.853
Yeah! [laughs]

03:49.437 --> 03:51.481
[captain] All you have to do is say yes…

03:52.023 --> 03:54.692
…and I will mold you
into the ultimate weapon.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.653
So…

03:56.736 --> 03:58.696
are you in or not?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.282
All in, sir.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.825
[captain] Excellent.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.296
[Johnny] "Hey, Johnny.
It really has been a long time.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.883
I don't even want to think
about how many years.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.761
But I'm still glad
we went to high school in the '80s.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.264
-We had the best music."
-[chuckles] Hell yeah!

04:24.347 --> 04:27.225
"Life has taken me in all kinds
of directions since then.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.727
I've been blessed
with my family and career.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.189
And I could probably still
kick your ass at air hockey.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.276
It's crazy how things change.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.195
I remember we used to see
each other every day."

04:39.279 --> 04:40.113
Hmm.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.323
"Now I don't know
the first thing about you.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.867
Who are you now?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.745
Your profile is pretty bare.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.415
What are you up to these days?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.166
Ali."

04:55.753 --> 04:57.630
What are you up to these days?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.427
[sighs]

05:04.971 --> 05:06.097
I'm home!

05:06.806 --> 05:09.017
The conquering hero has returned.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.770
Hey, wait till I tell you
what happened over there.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.690
-It was truly amazing.
-Oh.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.277
[Daniel] And I come bearing gifts.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.572
I got this randoseru bag for Sam

05:22.655 --> 05:24.991
and these crazy Kit-Kats for Anthony.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.993
Soy sauce as a Kit-Kat flavor!

05:27.076 --> 05:29.412
I know, I know.
It shouldn't work, but it does.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.582
I thought next weekend we could go
to wine country. Just you and I.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.210
-Hey, guys. Come down.
-Uh, the kids are at your mother's.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.589
Oh. My mother's? Why, what happened?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.966
John Kreese.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.763
[hisses]

05:46.846 --> 05:49.807
[Mitch] Man, it was so sick!
Tory was just kickin' ass.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.184
I took care of Chris.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.395
Hawk got that beta Demetri
in an arm bar like Chris Jericho

05:54.479 --> 05:56.189
and just… [mimics break]

05:56.272 --> 05:57.273
Cold-blooded.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.193
-No mercy!
-[Red] Way to go, Hawk.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.364
I didn't think
you were actually gonna do it.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.742
They got what they deserved
for what they did to Miguel.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.873
-Still haven't seen him, have you?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.918
[door opens, bell jangles]

06:24.258 --> 06:28.012
Look at this freak. What kind of girl
would ever kiss this shit?

06:28.096 --> 06:29.472
[Kreese] Class.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.432
Welcome our new students.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.482
I'm gonna call you guys…
Chodenose and Taintbreath.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.026
-What the hell did you just say?
-Oh, uh, nothing.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.612
It's just this thing we do
around here sometimes.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.406
OK.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.827
Sensei, I don't think
these guys are Cobra Kai material.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.205
Weren't you the one saying
that we should get new recruits?

06:54.288 --> 06:55.540
[new students giggling]

06:55.623 --> 06:59.544
Well, yeah. But… Look, I know
some of these guys and they're--

06:59.627 --> 07:00.920
Natural athletes.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.714
Which is exactly
what's been missing in our dojo.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.551
Everyone, fall in.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.267
Joining Cobra Kai is a privilege.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.852
It's not a gift.

07:15.935 --> 07:20.731
Which is why our recruits must earn
their position in this dojo.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.444
Prepare yourselves for combat.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.781
Only the strong will survive.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.245
[rope straining]

07:35.997 --> 07:37.373
Are you ready, or what?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.792
I hate this. This is ridiculous.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.796
-What's ridiculous about it?
-I look like a giant baby!

07:43.880 --> 07:47.717
The way you're whining and not walking,
you might as well be a baby.

07:48.217 --> 07:51.220
Isn't there a more badass way
we can do this?

07:51.304 --> 07:54.932
You think tapping your foot at a concert
makes you ready for badass training?

07:55.683 --> 07:58.728
Your legs are still pussies!
Now, you ready to stand?

07:58.811 --> 08:00.188
-Yes.
-OK.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.398
One, two...

08:02.482 --> 08:03.608
[exhales heavily]

08:03.691 --> 08:05.109
...three, go.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.488
All right. Better fall that time.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.573
Let's take five.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.949
[sighs]

08:16.537 --> 08:17.497
You know, uh,

08:18.623 --> 08:20.917
Mom's been talking about you
a lot recently.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.585
Oh, yeah?

08:22.668 --> 08:25.505
She says thank you
for taking me to that concert.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.923
She say anything else?

08:28.049 --> 08:28.883
No.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.885
You writing a novel?

08:31.761 --> 08:34.597
Oh. No, it's a Facebook message.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.516
That? To who?

08:36.599 --> 08:37.892
I, uh...

08:38.392 --> 08:40.520
-Babe from high school.
-Oh.

08:40.603 --> 08:41.604
Ali.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.941
Ali? Like, the Ali?

08:45.650 --> 08:48.194
This is huge. This is huge!

08:48.277 --> 08:50.905
This is so… But I mean,
you're not gonna send that, right?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.659
You cannot send her that message.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.995
-Why not?
-Because it's, like, 80 pages.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.330
In all caps.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.875
I have 35 years' worth of stuff to say,
all right?

09:02.959 --> 09:06.212
OK, yeah, yeah. yeah.
But shorter messages are way cooler.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.423
Like, this just looks desperate.
And a little creepy.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.842
Sending her this would be like if you…

09:13.052 --> 09:15.096
like if you liked all of her photos.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.724
Oh, no.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.935
Oh, no!

09:21.018 --> 09:23.479
What the hell, man? I enjoyed the photos!

09:23.563 --> 09:26.399
And there's a button for that,
why wouldn't I click it?

09:26.482 --> 09:28.192
Because she can see that.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.195
[sighs] All right, I got amped-up, OK?

09:31.279 --> 09:34.448
Look, she put a smiley face.
It's even got little red cheeks.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.160
Is she gettin' hot? Feelin' hot?
What am I supposed to do with that?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.538
I think it's just a smiley face.
Let's see.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.167
OK, she says she wants to know
what you've been up to.

09:45.251 --> 09:49.505
Good. This is good. We can salvage this.
Let's just make you a kick-ass profile.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.425
You'll be sending your message
from a position of strength.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.845
Uh… First we need to get some pictures.
Do you have any photos?

09:55.928 --> 09:57.263
-Yeah, photos?
-Yeah.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.681
-Yeah, don't move.
-OK.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.600
[chuckles] I said "don't move!"

10:01.726 --> 10:04.312
[Daniel] I can't believe
you went over to that dojo.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.480
Are you OK? I mean, is Sam OK?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.858
She's shaken up. How could she not be?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.652
Honestly, I'm shaken up too

10:11.736 --> 10:15.239
with a Cape Fear level karate psycho
terrorizing the neighborhood.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.825
See? It sounds crazy
when you say it out loud.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.536
No. Sounds crazy
when other people said it.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.038
But now I'm saying it.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.623
Look, the man is sick.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.666
He's got weapons on his walls.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.711
And his students broke Demetri's arm.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.588
Wait, wait, wait. They did what?

10:31.088 --> 10:31.922
[mouthing]

10:32.006 --> 10:35.217
-[sighs] I'm going over there.
-What, are you gonna hit him?

10:35.301 --> 10:38.012
Look, It's that kind of insanity
got us into this mess.

10:38.095 --> 10:42.099
And sanity will get us out, OK?
We're gonna stop him. We have to.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.354
-But we're gonna do it my way.
-What's your way?

10:46.437 --> 10:48.939
Going to the police.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.738
[Kreese] Class, prepare for combat.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.824
-[student 1] All right.
-[Brucks] Pet snake! Legit! Yeah.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.748
Holy shit! You remember?
Look, it's the kid with the lip!

11:05.831 --> 11:10.211
-Yo, I thought he moved.
-Oh, shit. You're right! Right.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.796
-[Kyler] Dude!
-[Brucks] Whoa!

11:11.879 --> 11:14.882
-The hair kinda distracts you from it.
-[laughs]

11:14.965 --> 11:16.342
[Kreese] All right, class.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.969
Let the games begin.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.852
-You.
-[Brucks] Ooh!

11:26.936 --> 11:28.604
All right, bro. You got this.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.774
[laughs] You.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.281
Man, I'm so pumped!

11:41.826 --> 11:42.660
[Kreese] Ready?

11:46.706 --> 11:47.748

Where you going?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.248
To my spot.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.208
[Kreese] You lost to an untrained fighter.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.628
-He's going to take your spot on the team.
-[Brucks] All right!

12:39.842 --> 12:43.137

Assface has been loyal to the dojo.

You lose concentration on the battlefield,
and you're dead meat! You understand?

13:13.292 --> 13:16.504
- Yes, Captain. Sorry, I just thought--
-Don't think!

13:16.587 --> 13:20.591
Your enemy wants you dead,
you have two choices. Kill or be killed.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.636
No hesitation,
no second thoughts, and no mercy!

13:23.719 --> 13:26.764
-What if they surrender?
-[captain] Never trust your enemy.

13:26.847 --> 13:31.143
You can leave all that peace and love crap
for the college sissies back home!

13:31.227 --> 13:33.854
Now, gentlemen,
we have a mission tomorrow. Are we ready?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.272
[all] Yes, sir.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.358
-You better hope so.
-[sergeant] Captain.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.319
Now go get some rest.
You're gonna need it.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.782
[man] Hey, Herman. Over here.

that hit though.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.004
Not a word of this to Kreese, understood?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.590
A distraction like that
could get him killed.

You know, we're probably just better off
going with some new photos.

Yeah, like present day?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.000
Mmm.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.836
Not sure I want you
to grease me up right now.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.880

I was just thinking maybe we could go
with something more contemporary. Yeah?

14:48.929 --> 14:53.225
Yes! We'll look at what Ali's into,
take pictures of me doing the same stuff!

-I'm not doing yoga.

-No.
-I will pet a dog.

get in with the dolphins?

-All right. Let's go, Hot Wheels. C'mon.

-No. It's against you, ma'am.

15:37.061 --> 15:37.895
[both] What?

15:37.978 --> 15:40.272
Looks like Mr. Kreese came in
and gave a statement.

Says here you showed up
at his place of business

15:43.442 --> 15:45.361
after hours, enraged.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.529
OK, I was not enraged.

15:47.613 --> 15:51.075
It was a perfectly measured response
to a man inciting violence.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.663
-And you struck him?
-That's ridiculous. He's a liar.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.626
-Honey?
-This story is missing a lot of context.

16:00.709 --> 16:01.710
You hit him?

16:04.254 --> 16:08.592
-The man's a menace. He's deranged!

The mental health stigma is real.

-You oughta be more considerate.
-I don't care if he has 50 Purple Hearts.

16:19.019 --> 16:23.273
I still wanna file a restraining
emergency protection thing against him.

16:23.357 --> 16:28.028
OK, but it'd just be the same thing.
You can't be within 500 yards of him, so…

16:28.112 --> 16:30.823
This is a joke.
Are you gonna take his word for it?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.908
It's up to a judge to sort out.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.908
[soldiers speaking Vietnamese]

25:44.042 --> 25:45.669
You son of a bitch, Kreese!

25:46.461 --> 25:48.046
We had 'em. You killed us!

25:48.129 --> 25:49.548
I... I couldn't.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.219
[speaks Vietnamese]

26:00.100 --> 26:01.101
Johnny, I'm…

26:02.060 --> 26:03.228
[gun cocks]

26:04.479 --> 26:05.522
[gun cocks]

26:07.190 --> 26:08.316
[gun fires]

26:08.400 --> 26:11.653
Oh, God, he's dead because of me!
It's my fault. God!

26:11.736 --> 26:13.238
Shut your goddamn mouth, Silver!

26:15.031 --> 26:18.159
I told you not to hesitate,
and now look what you did!

26:18.243 --> 26:20.328
Look at him, Kreese! Look!

26:20.412 --> 26:22.414
[somber music playing]

26:25.417 --> 26:27.419
[door opens, bell jangles]

26:34.718 --> 26:35.760
What do you want?

26:36.636 --> 26:39.055
Look, you pay your rent on time,

26:39.139 --> 26:40.390
but, unfortunately,

26:41.141 --> 26:43.602
I got a much higher offer for this space.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.728
So, uh…

26:45.687 --> 26:47.731
you can't rent here anymore.

26:48.315 --> 26:52.569
-What about our contract?
-All my contracts have escape clauses.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.487
And I have eviction papers.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.406
Uh, so...

26:57.240 --> 26:58.908
you have to leave today.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.327
That's not happening.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.453
[Armand sighs]

27:02.954 --> 27:04.873
-Erik! Grigor!
-[bell jangles]

27:04.956 --> 27:06.958
[dramatic music playing]

27:12.756 --> 27:15.091
My nephews are going to help you leave.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.344
Whether you like it or not.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.096
[nephews grumble softly]

27:20.180 --> 27:22.265
I just cleaned the blood off that mat.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.187
Oh, well.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.315
[Johnny] Focus!

27:32.192 --> 27:36.321
Come on, this is worse than yesterday!
You aren't trying. What's the problem?

27:36.404 --> 27:37.989
You saw your ex. Big deal.

27:39.199 --> 27:43.912
Big deal? Dude, look at you. We spent
all day doing bullshit for your ex,

27:43.995 --> 27:45.914
making you look like someone you're not.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.500
At least
I told my ex how things really were!

27:49.542 --> 27:52.420
Done with your little hissy fit
or are you just giving up?

27:53.088 --> 27:55.048
-No, you are.
-What'd you say?

27:55.131 --> 27:56.383
You're the one giving up.

27:56.466 --> 27:57.967
-I don't know--
-Quiet!

27:59.469 --> 28:00.970
You let Kreese take your dojo.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.973
You let Hawk, Tory, and everyone else
think you're weak.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.892
Because it was a mistake to begin with.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.104
I shouldn't have brought back Cobra Kai,
look what happened.

28:09.187 --> 28:12.732
What happened is you helped people
then walked away like a pussy.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.322
You're a sensei. It's who you are.
If you can't see that, you're blind.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.412
-Miguel…
-What?

28:29.082 --> 28:29.916
Huh.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.001
[gasps]

28:32.502 --> 28:35.255
-Am I doing it?
-You're doing it.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.175
-Holy shit! I'm doing it.
-You're doing it!

28:42.095 --> 28:43.388
-Thank you.
-Nah.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.182
No, thank you.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.318
[Johnny] I look ridiculous.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.537
[gentle rock music playing]

29:08.621 --> 29:12.375
[Johnny] Ali. You're right.
It's crazy how things change.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.920
For a long time,
I didn't have much direction in my life.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.214
But then, things got better.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.176
I met a kid who needed some help.

29:21.259 --> 29:24.012
So I got back into karate,
became a sensei.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.556
-Oh, yes!
-[Johnny] There were ups and downs.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.266
I even gave up for a while.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.977
But I can't give up anymore.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.898
I have a long way to go
to be a better man, a better father,

29:35.398 --> 29:36.399
a better teacher.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.319
But I can make
a difference in these kids' lives.

29:39.819 --> 29:43.490
It's a tough world out there,
and I can help them be ready for it.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.991
That's what I've been up to.

29:45.658 --> 29:46.910
That's who I am.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.286
I'm a sensei.

29:50.705 --> 29:51.831
Nah, too long.

29:52.373 --> 29:54.000
[peppy new wave music plays]

30:03.176 --> 30:05.512
[Louie] Thank you again for your business.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.222
While your car's being serviced,

30:07.305 --> 30:09.974
I wanna hook you up
with an Enterpise rental, very classy.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.977
My man Anoush is gonna help you
pick out something special.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.021
He's new and a little slow,

30:15.104 --> 30:17.649
so forgive him
if he's not as polished as me.

30:17.732 --> 30:21.110
I trained you. You were the garbage man
in the break room.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.404
See, this is what I'm talking about.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.159
He's the owner's cousin, so…

30:28.660 --> 30:29.661
Right this way.

30:29.744 --> 30:32.247
[Daniel] Looks like our ducks
are finally in a row.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.332
The dealership's back on its feet,

30:34.415 --> 30:37.627
Kreese is out of our lives.
How shall we celebrate?

30:39.045 --> 30:41.297
I was thinking maybe, like, a banner

30:41.381 --> 30:42.966
that says "I told you so."

30:43.049 --> 30:45.760
Uh-huh. All right. Go ahead.
Get it out of your system.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.719
I don't know, babe.

30:46.803 --> 30:50.849
All I'm saying is if I was around in '84.
you may not have as many stories to tell.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.143
-Uh-huh.
-I beat Cobra Kai in, what? One afternoon.

30:54.227 --> 30:58.064
All right. I did save the dealership
though. Don't I get a little credit?

30:58.648 --> 31:00.275
You get more than a little.

31:02.443 --> 31:04.946
-I can't believe it's over.
-[cell phone rings]

31:05.029 --> 31:07.198
-Here we go.
-Oh, put it on speaker.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.785
-Hey, Armand.
-LaRusso. The deal is off.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.620
[Amanda] What? We had an agreement.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.582
[Armand] No, no, no, no.
I can't get out of contract.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.667
[dramatic music plays]

31:18.543 --> 31:19.919
Hello, Danny boy.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.590
Nice try.
But you can't end a war with diplomacy.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.469
So I suggest
you prepare your students for battle.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.680
Because now,

31:31.431 --> 31:32.640
it's open season.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.934
On them…

31:35.018 --> 31:36.269
and you.

31:49.824 --> 31:53.870
-Oh, God, I hate snakes!
-Dude. Stop being a little bitch, OK?

31:53.953 --> 31:56.706
Oh, shit, I think it touched me!
I think it touched me!

31:57.707 --> 31:59.000
Oh, my God!
