00:01.018 --> 00:02.751
tning...

00:02.820 --> 00:04.687
I want you to meet my family.

00:04.722 --> 00:07.189
No. No, no, sorry.
[stutters] I can't make it.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.024
I haven't even said when.

00:09.527 --> 00:10.659
Grace?

00:10.695 --> 00:12.961
[Gambi]<i> Technically,</i>
<i> Grace Choi doesn't exist.</i>

00:12.997 --> 00:15.330
<i> It's a completely</i>
<i> false identity.</i>

00:15.366 --> 00:17.866
There's a lot this woman
didn't tell you about herself.

00:17.902 --> 00:19.401
Are you sure
you wanna find her?

00:19.437 --> 00:22.037
There's a lot
that I kept from her,
too, Gambi.

00:22.073 --> 00:26.208
Boss, this tech is ancient.
I mean, literally nuts
and bolts.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.243
Todd's already cracked
the briefcase,
and he doesn't know

00:28.279 --> 00:31.013
how to work
the Leavenworth pods.

00:31.048 --> 00:34.850
So, Todd got a new car.

00:34.885 --> 00:36.318
Lala!

00:36.353 --> 00:39.188
<i> I took your life in order</i>
<i> to make my purpose</i>
<i> your purpose.</i>

00:39.223 --> 00:41.990
<i> -I spent a cool mil</i>
<i> on a reanimation program.</i>
-[gasps]

00:42.026 --> 00:45.594
Eventually everyone
you killed is gonna come back
to haunt your black ass.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.196
[snivels]

00:47.231 --> 00:51.433
Tattooing themselves on
your body until there's
no skin left. [chuckles]

00:52.870 --> 00:55.170
["Slippin' Into Darkness"
playing]

01:31.809 --> 01:33.375
[door knob rattling]

02:06.043 --> 02:08.110
Latavious?

02:08.145 --> 02:10.679
Why you keep calling me that?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.881
You know I don't go
by that no more.

02:12.917 --> 02:16.752
That's like calling
Muhammad Ali, Cassius Clay.
It's disrespectful.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.224
Uh... I, uh,

02:22.259 --> 02:24.092
I didn't mean disrespect.

02:24.762 --> 02:26.295
It's just...

02:28.599 --> 02:31.033
You caught me
off guard.
I thought you were dead.

02:32.169 --> 02:35.304
I was dead. Twice.

02:37.374 --> 02:42.311
I knew I'd find you here,
working late
after everyone else is gone,

02:43.514 --> 02:45.280
'cause that's how you do.

02:46.517 --> 02:49.151
I didn't expect that
you'd be grading papers.

02:51.288 --> 02:53.121
Thought you was the principal.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.958
I was.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.895
[Jefferson sighs]

03:01.398 --> 03:04.600
<i> Ain't nobody checking</i>
<i> for the cameras, Mr. Pierce.</i>

03:07.071 --> 03:09.004
[Jefferson]
<i> They record everything.</i>

03:10.274 --> 03:11.440
<i> Good.</i>

03:11.475 --> 03:12.641
[scoffs]

03:15.412 --> 03:17.112
Why are you here?

03:21.385 --> 03:22.818
That's a good question.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.188
I came to see you.

03:28.158 --> 03:32.127
"Those who can't remember
their past are condemned
to repeat it."

03:33.764 --> 03:38.667
You know, most people
think that's
Winston Churchill.

03:41.171 --> 03:42.838
It's George Santayana.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.743
"What's past is prologue."

03:47.778 --> 03:51.280
Shakespeare.
A tribute to Shakespeare.

03:52.683 --> 03:55.550
I ain't forgot
what you taught me,
Mr. Pierce.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.553
It's just
the streets taught me, too.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.355
[cries out]

04:01.358 --> 04:04.893
I'm having a hard time
reconciling my past.

04:04.929 --> 04:08.830
When I die, I come back,
and what I've done
comes back on me.

04:08.866 --> 04:10.999
[breathing heavily]

04:11.035 --> 04:13.702
And this time,
I heard a voice that said...

04:15.005 --> 04:16.972
I have unfinished business.

04:20.911 --> 04:22.878
Which brought you to me.

04:23.847 --> 04:24.913
You gonna kill me?

04:24.949 --> 04:28.650
I need answers.
I need answers to my past.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.585
Why am I here?

04:32.122 --> 04:33.588
And that voice...

04:35.225 --> 04:37.759
That voice said
it's about you and Earl.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.769
Earl was like
a brother to me.

04:54.478 --> 04:56.712
And that voice sent me to you.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.687
[groaning]

05:07.958 --> 05:10.125
[breathing heavily]

05:10.861 --> 05:12.828
So you must've killed him.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.767
And you're gonna tell me why.

05:21.672 --> 05:24.239
<i> ¶ Last night</i>
<i> I saw a superhero</i>
<i> He was black ¶</i>

05:24.274 --> 05:26.975
<i> ¶ He said</i>
<i> "This is for the street</i>
<i> Black Lightning's back" ¶</i>

05:29.980 --> 05:31.546
Okay, lower.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.616
Like this?

05:35.119 --> 05:36.551
Mmm-mmm. Lower.

05:38.188 --> 05:40.155
-Lower.
-Hey, hey, hey.

05:40.190 --> 05:42.591
Come on.
It's not a swimsuit.

05:42.626 --> 05:45.660
Okay, thank you, Mom.
I know it's not a swimsuit.

05:45.696 --> 05:49.598
-Because if it was,
it'd be a teeny bikini.
-[both chuckling]

05:49.633 --> 05:52.501
All right, let me show you
something here.

05:52.536 --> 05:56.605
Yeah. Could you,
uh... make it
a little bit more like this?

05:56.640 --> 05:58.140
You know what I'm saying?

05:58.175 --> 06:01.276
Jen, you're not supposed
to look like a pop star.

06:01.311 --> 06:03.812
The suit is designed
to protect you.

06:03.847 --> 06:08.050
Okay, first off,
a ''pop star"?' Really?
And second, that's dope.

06:08.085 --> 06:09.351
-[Lynn] Dope?
-No.

06:11.188 --> 06:12.788
I hope we're
not talking about the suit,

06:12.823 --> 06:15.424
because when it comes that,
I care less about
you looking "dope,''

06:15.459 --> 06:17.993
-and more about
it keeping you safe.
-[Jennifer clears throat]

06:18.028 --> 06:19.461
Exactly.

06:20.230 --> 06:22.264
Okay, of course
I wanna be safe.

06:22.299 --> 06:26.701
But shouldn't have
to sacrifice style
over practicality.

06:26.737 --> 06:30.305
See, this is what
I'm talking about. I love
this fabric. This is nice.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.040
It oughta be.
It cost a fortune.

06:32.076 --> 06:34.810
Excuse me, am I the only one
taking this suit business
seriously?

06:34.845 --> 06:37.612
Of course not, Lynn.
You know I take it seriously.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.148
And I'm a lot better
at this than I used to be.

06:40.184 --> 06:41.216
Here.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.720
-Remember this?
-[Lynn] Oh! [laughing]

06:47.157 --> 06:48.990
Oh! [laughing]

06:49.026 --> 06:50.559
What is that?

06:50.594 --> 06:53.061
This is your dad's first suit.

06:53.730 --> 06:55.464
He wore that in public?

06:55.499 --> 06:58.700
Ask him about the time
he was outnumbered 20-to 1.

06:58.735 --> 07:01.303
This suit kept him alive.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.106
Okay. Well, if the suit's
so great, why is it
not his suit now?

07:04.141 --> 07:07.275
Well, that's because
George Clinton, he called,
he asked for it back.

07:07.311 --> 07:09.945
[laughing]

07:09.980 --> 07:11.913
That's really funny.
Ha-ha-ha!

07:11.949 --> 07:13.782
Look, the truth is,
that we discovered

07:13.817 --> 07:15.484
that the suit
was actually harming him.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.586
While it was keeping him safe
from the outside,

07:17.621 --> 07:19.154
it was hurting him
from the inside.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.257
Which is exactly why we need
to be less focused on you
looking cute

07:22.292 --> 07:23.825
and more focused
on you being safe.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.895
Okay. Okay. I get it.

07:27.598 --> 07:29.831
Why do you think
I killed Earl?

07:32.703 --> 07:35.003
[Lala] When Earl was around,
things was good.

07:36.006 --> 07:38.306
We ain't have a lot,
but we were happy.

07:38.342 --> 07:42.511
But we got in trouble
here and there, but it was
just kid stuff.

07:45.182 --> 07:46.948
But after Earl got murdered--

07:46.984 --> 07:50.018
Do you really think killing
another person
will make you feel better?

07:50.053 --> 07:53.321
If it's the right person.
[scoffs] Hell, yeah.

07:53.357 --> 07:56.091
That's why you should kill him
right here, right now.

07:56.126 --> 07:58.293
The same way you murked
me and Lawanda.

07:59.163 --> 08:00.862
No question, no hesitation.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.965
-Man, that's stupid.
Don't listen to this fool.
-Hey, who you calling stupid?

08:04.001 --> 08:05.534
The voice said find answers.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.669
-So let's find them.
-He killed Earl.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.804
What more do y'all need
to know?

08:09.840 --> 08:13.208
Sitting up in here talking
when y'all should be shooting.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.143
-Don't do this.
-Who're you talking to?

08:17.114 --> 08:18.513
What?

08:18.549 --> 08:20.549
Who are you speaking with?

08:23.820 --> 08:26.655
Oh, you think I'm crazy,
don't you?

08:26.690 --> 08:29.157
I think you've done
some terrible things,

08:29.193 --> 08:31.126
and that's why
you're suffering.

08:31.161 --> 08:32.527
[Will imitates gunshots]

08:32.563 --> 08:34.696
[Lawanda] Shut up!
[Will] Get your hands off me!

08:34.731 --> 08:36.998
Just shut up a minute!
Just shut up!

08:37.034 --> 08:40.268
One to the chest,
one to the head. That way,
you know they dead.

08:40.304 --> 08:42.237
[Will and Lawanda
arguing indistinctly]

08:42.272 --> 08:44.339
Look, I can see you suffering.
Let me help you.

08:44.374 --> 08:45.941
[Will and Lawanda
continue arguing]

08:45.976 --> 08:47.509
What?

08:47.544 --> 08:51.513
I can find someone
who can help you with whatever
you're dealing with.

08:51.548 --> 08:52.881
I don't need no damn help.

08:52.916 --> 08:55.350
You're damn right you don't!
So pop him off right now!

08:56.086 --> 08:59.688
Shut up!
[grunts] Shut up!

08:59.723 --> 09:02.724
Before I kill every
damn body in here again!

09:02.759 --> 09:04.859
[breathing heavily]

09:05.762 --> 09:08.496
The only thing
I need you to do...

09:11.468 --> 09:13.702
[sniffles]
is tell me what I wanna know,

09:14.938 --> 09:16.504
or you gonna die.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.520
Mom and Uncle Gambi
are driving me crazy.

09:37.294 --> 09:38.560
Hello?

09:40.964 --> 09:42.264
What're you looking at?

09:42.299 --> 09:43.431
What?

09:45.202 --> 09:46.668
Seriously?

09:46.703 --> 09:50.572
Grace, again?
Just go after her.

09:50.607 --> 09:52.807
I've been trying.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.309
Well, try harder!

09:55.345 --> 09:57.479
Do you know how lucky you are?

09:58.081 --> 09:59.881
What lucky? Huh?

09:59.916 --> 10:04.619
That someone I thought I had
something real with
just disappeared on me?

10:04.655 --> 10:07.989
[sighs] No, lucky there's hope
you could still have
something real.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.825
My hope died with Khalil.

10:12.729 --> 10:16.464
-Damn it. Don't say that--
-Look, stop. Stop.
That's how it is.

10:17.334 --> 10:20.001
That's how it is for me.

10:24.441 --> 10:25.940
Just go find Grace.

10:32.082 --> 10:33.548
[sighs]
Can you call me back, please,

10:33.583 --> 10:36.584
so we can talk about
that fast little daughter
of yours?

10:36.620 --> 10:38.420
Seriously, Jeff, I don't think
she's ready for all this.

10:38.455 --> 10:42.223
She's acting like she's
picking out a prom dress,
not a lifesaving suit.

10:42.259 --> 10:45.927
Please. Can you just
call me back, or at least
reply to my texts?

10:45.962 --> 10:48.563
I don't wanna worry
about you, too.

10:48.598 --> 10:49.964
I know you say
I worry too much.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.733
And you're probably fine,
but please,

10:51.768 --> 10:55.170
just can you call me back,
so I know you're okay?

10:56.940 --> 10:58.673
[beeping]

11:00.077 --> 11:04.813
[male ASA technician]
Wendy Hernandez,
wind velocity test, phase one.

11:04.848 --> 11:08.083
Nice and easy, okay?
I don't want you
overdoing it.

11:08.118 --> 11:11.386
If things get too intense,
we can always
dial it back, okay?

11:12.489 --> 11:13.555
Dr. Stewart,

11:15.592 --> 11:17.058
can I have a word?

11:18.562 --> 11:19.728
Yes.

11:25.769 --> 11:31.706
[clicks tongue]
She's not your kid.

11:31.742 --> 11:33.375
She doesn't need
to be coddled.

11:33.410 --> 11:35.877
I'm not coddling her.
I'm treating her like
a human being,

11:35.912 --> 11:39.381
which is something
you've clearly forgotten
how to do.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.684
See,

11:42.719 --> 11:48.757
some people have dogs
that they treat like
members of their family.

11:50.093 --> 11:53.094
They dress them up
in silly costumes

11:53.130 --> 11:58.633
and insist that the rest of us
treat them like relevant
members of the society.

11:58.668 --> 12:00.435
But they're not.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.871
They can, however,
be useful tools.

12:02.906 --> 12:07.275
Dogs can sniff out drugs
and landmines,

12:07.310 --> 12:10.278
but their relevance
is solely dependent

12:11.114 --> 12:16.518
on their ability
to be of service.

12:16.553 --> 12:17.852
Why are you
telling me this?

12:17.888 --> 12:22.290
Because I'm not here to waste
my sentiments on Wendy.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.025
Waste?

12:24.060 --> 12:27.128
She can't sniff out landmines,

12:27.164 --> 12:32.200
-but she can do other things
for her government...
-[sighs]

12:32.235 --> 12:37.272
...and her country, to keep
its citizens safe.

12:38.942 --> 12:41.810
That's why she's here.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.280
[inhales sharply]
She's here to get stronger,
healthier.

12:45.315 --> 12:50.285
She's here to realize
her full potential
for the benefit of all of us.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.955
Wendy could prove
to be more revolutionary

12:53.990 --> 12:56.925
than the tank
or the machine gun.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.295
But we absolutely
have no time to waste.

13:00.330 --> 13:04.466
Do you understand
what I am saying?

13:05.969 --> 13:07.569
That you don't like dogs?

13:11.141 --> 13:12.674
You, uh...

13:14.611 --> 13:19.514
have a very sharp wit,
Dr. Stewart.

13:20.650 --> 13:22.484
She's my patient,
Agent Odell.

13:22.552 --> 13:26.387
They all are, no matter
who they are, or what
they are, they're my patients.

13:26.423 --> 13:30.658
-And I refuse to check
my humanity at the door!
-[door slams]

13:37.501 --> 13:38.967
You're doing great!

13:46.843 --> 13:48.476
Still haven't heard back
from Jefferson.

13:48.512 --> 13:52.146
But I left him a couple
of messages.
What did you find?

13:52.182 --> 13:54.249
I ran the partial image
from the security footage

13:54.284 --> 13:56.951
at the Rebecca Lee
Crumpler Clinic
that you sent me.

13:56.987 --> 13:58.620
And?

13:58.655 --> 14:00.889
There wasn't enough for me
to come up with the name
of the person in the image,

14:00.924 --> 14:04.626
but there was however enough
for me to come up
with 50 names.

14:04.661 --> 14:07.762
Luckily, only three
of those names
are here in Freeland.

14:07.797 --> 14:11.199
And one has been seen
with known associates
of Tobias Whale.

14:11.701 --> 14:13.001
Bingo.

14:17.507 --> 14:20.074
[voices
whispering indistinctly]

14:32.656 --> 14:33.888
[grunts]

14:36.626 --> 14:37.859
Shh!

14:49.005 --> 14:50.405
[grunting]

14:56.079 --> 14:58.780
-[voices continue whispering]
-[breathing heavily]

14:58.815 --> 15:00.114
[Jefferson] Hey! Hey, hey!

15:00.650 --> 15:01.749
You still with me?

15:01.785 --> 15:02.951
[grunts]

15:05.121 --> 15:07.021
[Jefferson] Look,
maybe this will help.

15:08.291 --> 15:12.493
Earl was a great student,

15:12.529 --> 15:16.164
he won science fairs, tutored.

15:16.199 --> 15:20.435
You know, he won
the talent show once,

15:21.004 --> 15:23.037
could sing like an angel.

15:23.073 --> 15:27.909
After all these years,
not a day that goes by
that I don't think about him.

15:36.653 --> 15:38.953
I thought you and Earl
were gonna be--

15:38.989 --> 15:40.488
Gonna be what?

15:42.492 --> 15:43.958
Successful.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.529
It's still blank.

15:48.565 --> 15:50.164
You know more than
what you saying.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.299
You stalling.

15:51.334 --> 15:53.267
That's 'cause
his ass is lying.

15:53.303 --> 15:55.370
Look at him,
he's all twitchy and jumpy.

15:55.405 --> 15:59.407
-Lala just shot him.
How's he supposed to act?
-[Lala shushes]

15:59.442 --> 16:01.542
-How did he die?
-I don't know.

16:01.578 --> 16:04.512
Damn it, don't play me.
I will shoot you straight
in the face.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.848
All I know is
how he was found.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.250
The police, they got nowhere,

16:09.285 --> 16:11.586
dismissed it
as a gang killing
and moved on.

16:11.621 --> 16:14.689
Students,
if they knew anything,
they didn't say anything.

16:16.459 --> 16:17.859
I remember that.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.496
The Hundred
wasn't what it is now.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.965
They were on the come up.

16:24.768 --> 16:26.100
You think they did it?

16:27.203 --> 16:29.270
-Yeah, I think they did.
-Why?

16:32.909 --> 16:34.976
[sighs]

16:35.011 --> 16:37.712
Earl was being hassled
by the One Hundred.

16:39.449 --> 16:40.882
Came to me for advice.

16:41.951 --> 16:43.484
And what'd you say?

16:45.522 --> 16:47.689
I told him
to go to the cops.

16:50.527 --> 16:52.026
I thought he'd be okay.

16:52.062 --> 16:54.095
Why would you think that?

16:54.130 --> 16:56.264
You know how things
go down here.
You know what it is.

16:56.299 --> 16:59.767
Look, I thought
Black Lightning
would change things.

16:59.803 --> 17:01.903
Well, he didn't,
and neither did you.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.505
All y'all did
was get Earl killed.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.508
[softly] Yeah,
you probably right.

17:09.312 --> 17:11.045
That's all I needed to hear.

17:11.548 --> 17:12.580
[grunts]

17:13.516 --> 17:14.949
[Jefferson grunting]

17:14.984 --> 17:16.851
-[stabs]
-[screams]

17:18.188 --> 17:20.021
[Lawanda grunts]

17:20.056 --> 17:21.656
I got her.
Finish his ass off.

17:21.691 --> 17:23.191
You ain't got nobody.

17:23.860 --> 17:25.193
[Will grunts]

17:28.998 --> 17:30.264
[both grunting]

17:32.602 --> 17:34.669
[Lala] Hey.

17:35.371 --> 17:36.838
Come on, man. Hey, hey!

17:36.873 --> 17:38.506
Y'all need to quit, man.

17:38.541 --> 17:40.408
[Will grunts]

17:42.145 --> 17:43.478
[grunts]

17:43.513 --> 17:46.647
Can we both get out
of this classroom alive

17:46.683 --> 17:49.283
without causing each other
more pain?

17:49.319 --> 17:51.119
Oh, you trying
to save your life?

17:51.154 --> 17:52.453
No. I'm trying to save yours.

17:52.489 --> 17:55.890
I already told you...
I can't die.

17:59.996 --> 18:04.766
Oh, you gonna need more than
that gun to save your ass.

18:06.102 --> 18:07.201
[grunts]

18:08.772 --> 18:10.905
It's not about saving my ass.

18:16.646 --> 18:19.380
-You came here for answers,
right? Hmm?
-Mmm-hmm.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.817
There's a void in your memory,

18:24.120 --> 18:28.389
but somehow you,
you know that history

18:28.424 --> 18:31.025
is at the root
of what's troubling you.

18:31.060 --> 18:36.464
Now, I had old yearbooks
scanned into digital archives.

18:38.601 --> 18:41.135
Maybe this will help
with your memory.

18:47.443 --> 18:48.910
[shudders]

18:55.318 --> 18:56.784
[sniveling]

19:04.511 --> 19:07.411
-Deputy Chief.
-You're just in time.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.380
I got a statement
from an informant

19:09.415 --> 19:13.784
that Todd Green
partied with Tobias Whale
at Club One Hundred.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.020
I'm gonna pick him up.
You're my backup.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.990
Sir, we just got ID on a body
in a car that blew up.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.367
It's Todd Green.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.769
Yes, sir.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.738
You can take that to Evidence.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.080
[sighs]

19:48.888 --> 19:50.388
[beeping]

19:53.793 --> 19:56.561
Oh, Rodney.
Um, this is not working
right now.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.230
I can have security check it.
But could you just buzz me in?

19:59.265 --> 20:00.831
I'm afraid not,
Dr. Stewart.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.134
What do you mean?

20:03.169 --> 20:07.071
I'm not permitted to allow you
into the secure space
with the subject.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.674
What? What're you
talking about?

20:09.709 --> 20:12.810
Rodney,
I asked you a question!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.447
[Wendy screaming]

20:22.589 --> 20:24.655
You let me in right now!

20:31.097 --> 20:35.466
She's powering up too fast!
She's gonna have an aneurysm.
Can't you all see that?

20:37.136 --> 20:38.236
Stop it!

20:38.905 --> 20:41.172
You stop it right now!

20:46.145 --> 20:49.880
Get your hands off me!
No, you let me go!

20:49.916 --> 20:53.017
What're you doing?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.324
Her foster parents have been
dead a long time,

21:00.360 --> 21:03.160
but Grace did have
a foster brother,
a year younger.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.529
<i> This was his last address</i>
<i> of record.</i>

21:06.966 --> 21:08.132
[sighs]

21:10.937 --> 21:12.536
[hurried footsteps retreating]

21:15.875 --> 21:19.677
Hello? I can hear
someone in here.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.713
Well, at least I could.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.250
[sighs]

21:26.286 --> 21:29.186
Listen, I'm not the police
or anything.

21:29.222 --> 21:33.157
I'm just looking
for some info on Grace.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.726
She's not in any trouble,
I hope not.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.899
I just wanna make sure
that she's okay
and if you can help--

21:43.169 --> 21:45.903
Hi. Hi.
I'm Anissa Pierce.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.839
I'm a friend of Grace.
Grace Choi.

21:53.313 --> 21:57.348
Like I said, I... really
not here for any trouble.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.816
I just wanna make sure
that she's okay.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.252
Trouble will find you
if you do not leave
this place.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.587
Excuse me?

22:07.060 --> 22:08.959
Whoa! Is everything
all right in here?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.494
Leave while you can.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.130
[knocking on door]

22:13.166 --> 22:16.467
Grace? Grace. Are you in here?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.436
-Grace!
-[banging on door]

22:19.372 --> 22:21.539
Grace.
Grace, are you in there?

22:22.742 --> 22:23.941
Grace?

22:28.014 --> 22:29.080
Grace?

22:29.515 --> 22:30.781
Grace!

22:42.829 --> 22:44.295
Who is that?

22:48.434 --> 22:51.202
Earl.
[inhales deeply]

22:52.004 --> 22:53.504
It's Earl.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.345
-Can you see him now?
-Mmm-hmm.

23:02.749 --> 23:06.584
Can you remember
where he lived?

23:10.022 --> 23:11.922
Right next door.

23:13.693 --> 23:17.428
Was Earl involved in anything?
Anything sketchy?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.566
Not really.

23:22.602 --> 23:26.270
I mean, he sold some drugs
for The Hundred,
like the rest of us poor kids.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.273
But he wasn't built for it.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.544
So he decided to get out
of the game. I'd even got--

23:34.647 --> 23:35.880
Wait, you got him what?

23:35.915 --> 23:39.483
-I mean, I was slanging, too.
[sniffles]
-Okay.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.052
I mean, looking to move up,
make more money.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.021
He was supposed to be
helping me out.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.457
And?

23:46.492 --> 23:48.726
He wasn't with it.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.462
So I looked out for him,
got him a free pass.

23:53.900 --> 23:57.535
Wait. If Earl had a free pass,
then why'd they go after him?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.069
You know why.

24:03.409 --> 24:04.642
[sighs]

24:06.846 --> 24:12.383
I told Earl to tell the police
about the One Hundred's
business.

24:13.352 --> 24:17.054
And Tobias had some guys
on the force,

24:17.089 --> 24:19.990
and when he found out
about it, he put a hit
out on Earl.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.493
Did you warn him?

24:22.528 --> 24:26.864
Nah, it was a wrap.
Wasn't no stopping it.

24:26.899 --> 24:30.100
If Tobias want you got,
it was a done deal.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.904
And I wasn't gonna let
anyone kill Earl.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.674
Then what happened?

24:39.312 --> 24:41.178
[breathing heavily]

24:48.054 --> 24:49.787
I killed him myself.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.457
He was caught up.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.460
I mean, he was gonna get got.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.634
Why'd you hang him
in the hoop?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.839
Because I ain't wanna
be poor no more.

25:10.343 --> 25:13.110
I had to show Tobias
that I was serious,

25:13.145 --> 25:15.212
and that I could
send a message.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.716
You need to turn yourself in.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.488
There you go. No.

25:27.793 --> 25:31.028
I'm gonna make Tobias pay.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.397
And after that,
it don't matter.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.902
"The past is always tense,

25:39.805 --> 25:41.372
but the future perfect."

25:44.176 --> 25:45.242
Who said that?

25:49.482 --> 25:51.015
Zadie Smith.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.885
She also said,
"Every moment happens twice:

25:54.921 --> 25:58.389
inside and out,
and there's two
different histories."

26:00.226 --> 26:02.426
I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.664
Thank you for everything.

26:18.444 --> 26:19.877
[door closes]

26:24.817 --> 26:26.951
[voice whispering
indistinctly]

26:39.999 --> 26:41.599
Earl?

26:48.374 --> 26:49.807
[groaning]

26:51.611 --> 26:53.410
[screaming]

26:55.581 --> 26:58.148
[exclaiming in pain]

27:24.894 --> 27:26.960
[takes deep breath]

27:28.931 --> 27:30.531
[cell phone vibrating]

27:30.566 --> 27:31.732
[sighs] Yeah?

27:31.767 --> 27:33.734
We just ID'd the body
of Todd Green.

27:33.769 --> 27:35.636
-[Gambi]<i> Tobias?</i>
-Yeah.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.274
I did make a dent
in that other thing
that we talked about.

27:40.309 --> 27:42.710
Oh, you got something on
the break-in at the clinic?

27:42.745 --> 27:45.646
If I can isolate
the radioactive residue
we found in the basement,

27:45.681 --> 27:49.650
then maybe I can identify
what was taken from the clinic
and possibly track it.

27:49.685 --> 27:52.353
[scoffs] That's more than
my people can do,
I'm all for it.

27:52.388 --> 27:54.755
<i> -I'll let you know</i>
<i> when I find something.</i>
-Great.

27:54.790 --> 27:55.889
Okay.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.825
[panting] Okay,
is it finished yet?

27:57.860 --> 28:00.027
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, now look,

28:00.062 --> 28:02.296
I know I'm not as cool
as I used to be--

28:02.331 --> 28:03.497
That's all right.

28:03.532 --> 28:06.033
But I did listen to what
you had to say,

28:06.068 --> 28:08.769
-and I tried to reflect
your ideas. So I hope--
-Okay.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.641
That's it?

28:14.677 --> 28:16.477
[sighs] You don't like it.

28:17.580 --> 28:18.879
[pants]

28:18.914 --> 28:20.447
-[screams]
-[both laughing]

28:20.516 --> 28:23.617
-Okay, okay, I'm just gonna
take one selfie--
-No, no, no, no, no.

28:23.652 --> 28:25.519
No [sighs] The only people
I'm gonna show

28:25.554 --> 28:27.154
are my mom, my dad, Anissa.
That's it.

28:27.189 --> 28:29.757
I'm not 100% done with it.
There are some kinks
I have to work out--

28:29.792 --> 28:31.859
No, that's okay.
It looks great.
It's beautiful.

28:31.894 --> 28:33.026
Please, just one photo.

28:33.062 --> 28:34.661
[sighs] I'm not comfortable
with that.

28:36.265 --> 28:38.298
[sighs] Fine, at least
let me try it on.

28:38.334 --> 28:39.500
Jen...

28:39.535 --> 28:41.201
Please?

28:41.237 --> 28:42.636
[sighs]

28:45.508 --> 28:48.909
-[Gambi] How do you feel?
-Great! [chuckles]

28:48.944 --> 28:51.612
I will feel even better
if you let me
take a photo, though.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.480
Jen, it's just the foundation
for the suit.

28:53.516 --> 28:57.017
It's not even
how it's gonna really look.
I just need you to focus.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.653
I am focused.

28:59.688 --> 29:01.955
Okay.
Just move around a little.

29:03.692 --> 29:06.326
Oh. Okay. Okay.

29:07.196 --> 29:08.996
[chuckles] Nice moves.

29:09.031 --> 29:11.198
See, I told you
you could be a pop star.

29:11.233 --> 29:14.668
[chuckles] Yeah.
Oh, Uncle Gambi,
check out my moonwalk.

29:14.703 --> 29:17.638
Look. I don't think
you've seen this. Hey,

29:18.441 --> 29:19.973
[chuckles]
check me out.

29:23.279 --> 29:24.912
[chuckles]

29:24.947 --> 29:27.581
-[alarm beeping]
-Oh, my God.

29:27.616 --> 29:31.051
-Uncle Gambi! Uncle Gambi,
open it. Let me out!
-Jen!

29:31.086 --> 29:34.488
-Let me out!
-No, it's okay.
It's all right.

29:34.523 --> 29:37.291
Uncle Gambi, let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!

29:37.326 --> 29:40.160
It's all right. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay, Jen.

29:40.196 --> 29:43.030
It wasn't done.
I shouldn't have
let this happen.

29:43.065 --> 29:44.698
No, it's fine.
It's my fault.

29:44.733 --> 29:48.068
I shouldn't have been
pushing it like that.
I'm sorry.

29:48.103 --> 29:50.037
The suit wasn't done.
I'm sorry, kid.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.105
[pants] Come on.

29:59.515 --> 30:01.248
Hello?

30:01.283 --> 30:05.586
Hello. Grace, are you inside?
Are you okay? Grace?

30:10.359 --> 30:11.725
Ah. Damn!

30:11.760 --> 30:13.961
[flies buzzing]

30:15.464 --> 30:16.964
Oh...

30:19.435 --> 30:21.268
[buzzing gets louder]

30:22.137 --> 30:23.537
What the hell?

30:34.984 --> 30:37.050
[Grace as old man]
You should not
have come here.

30:38.153 --> 30:41.688
I'm looking for Grace.
Grace Choi.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.991
[Grace as old man]
Leave, before it's too late.

30:44.994 --> 30:46.927
Too late for what?

30:46.962 --> 30:48.328
[Grace as old man] You.

30:59.174 --> 31:00.941
[both grunting]

31:09.785 --> 31:11.184
[Thunder groans]

31:15.057 --> 31:16.757
[both grunting]

31:21.263 --> 31:23.630
[panting] Where's Grace Choi?

31:32.408 --> 31:33.974
[Thunder exclaims]

32:03.706 --> 32:05.138
What the hell?

32:09.561 --> 32:10.827
[Lynn sighs]

32:10.863 --> 32:13.864
-The man is clearly
a sociopath.
-[Jennifer] Mmm-hmm.

32:13.899 --> 32:15.365
He watched
that kid almost die,

32:15.401 --> 32:17.901
and he didn't even
break a sweat.

32:18.737 --> 32:21.271
Then he compared her
to an animal.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.706
[Jennifer] An animal?

32:22.741 --> 32:26.009
A dog. It was strange.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.412
Actually, he compared her
to a machine gun.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.315
He compared Wendy to a weapon.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.918
So, basically I'm being paid
to weaponize these kids
for war. [sighs]

32:36.055 --> 32:37.721
[Jennifer] You have
the worst boss ever.

32:37.756 --> 32:40.190
Yeah, well,
I'm not gonna do it.

32:40.225 --> 32:41.892
I might not have been able
to save the others,

32:41.927 --> 32:44.127
but I'll be damned
if I'm going to be used
[takes deep breath]

32:44.163 --> 32:46.863
to turn Wendy into a weapon
of mass destruction.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.732
[Jennifer] Okay.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.501
[sighs]

32:51.537 --> 32:53.470
You know what?
I'm sorry. This...

32:53.505 --> 32:56.039
This is a one-sided
conversation. [sighs]

32:57.309 --> 32:59.076
How was your day?

32:59.111 --> 33:03.547
[clicks tongue]
Or should I say,
how was the suit?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.450
Uh, good.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.019
Good? That's, that's it?

33:09.054 --> 33:11.722
That's all you got?
I thought you'd be
more excited.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.457
I thought you'd be
wearing it right now.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.459
I am excited. It's just...

33:16.295 --> 33:17.894
I listened to what
you guys said,

33:17.930 --> 33:20.931
and the most important thing
is that it's safe.

33:20.966 --> 33:23.300
-Well, I don't know
what's gotten into you...
-[door opens]

33:23.335 --> 33:24.735
...but I like it.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.136
[door closes]

33:26.171 --> 33:29.172
Hey, there you are.
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

33:29.208 --> 33:32.409
What did we say about staying
in touch? Checking in?

33:32.444 --> 33:33.910
-[chuckling]
-I know. I know. I'm sorry.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.779
Um, I had a day.

33:35.814 --> 33:39.416
Yeah, Dad, we're supposed
to check in so that we don't
make Mom worry, remember?

33:39.451 --> 33:40.784
-[Lynn scoffs]
-Thank you, Jennifer.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.419
You're welcome, Daddy.

33:42.454 --> 33:46.256
Oh, my God, I have had a day.
Y'all would never guess
what happened.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.125
-[Lynn chuckles]
-Did you finally find Grace?

33:48.160 --> 33:49.659
Not exactly.

33:50.462 --> 33:51.495
What happened?

33:51.530 --> 33:55.332
Well, I searched for her
but didn't find her.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.200
That's your crazy story?

33:57.236 --> 33:58.935
Found something else.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.072
Well, what'd you find,
sweetie?

34:02.107 --> 34:05.075
I don't know. But I was
just wondering,

34:05.110 --> 34:08.979
how do you know if someone
is more trouble
than they're worth?

34:09.014 --> 34:12.182
The baggage, the drama,
if it's just way too much
for you to take on?

34:12.217 --> 34:14.751
Well, Mom should be able
to answer that question.

34:14.787 --> 34:16.586
Jennifer!

34:16.622 --> 34:19.156
I'm just saying
it couldn't have been easy.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.124
You're so normal,
and Dad is...

34:21.160 --> 34:23.059
Dad is what?

34:23.095 --> 34:26.696
Like us.
Y'all know what I mean.

34:27.633 --> 34:30.033
Look, that's why
I loved Khalil. Okay?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.468
He loved me,
weirdness and all.

34:31.503 --> 34:35.005
And I think we all
deserve love like that.
Don't we?

34:35.441 --> 34:37.107
Yeah.

34:37.676 --> 34:38.775
I guess we do.

34:40.479 --> 34:41.978
[softly] Come here.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.449
What was that for?

34:45.484 --> 34:49.252
Mmm. Just because you
a good sister. That's why.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.420
[Jefferson sighs]

34:50.456 --> 34:53.356
[Lynn] So, how was your day?
Come on, tell me.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.192
-Today was hard.
-What happened?

34:56.395 --> 34:58.395
Um... [clears throat]

34:59.832 --> 35:04.401
A former student of mine
was angry and...

35:05.537 --> 35:08.472
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

35:08.507 --> 35:11.641
Does not matter. What matters
is I am here now,

35:11.677 --> 35:15.212
[through speakers]
<i> with the people I love,</i>
<i> the people who love me,</i>

35:15.247 --> 35:18.582
<i> -despite my "weirdness."</i>
-[all laughing]

35:18.617 --> 35:22.719
[Anissa]<i> Well, you know, Dad,</i>
<i> no offense, but your stories,</i>
<i> they can be a little long.</i>

35:22.754 --> 35:24.087
[all laughing]

35:24.122 --> 35:25.922
-Yep.
-[Jefferson] Cheers.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.158
-Cheers.
-[Jennifer] My glass
is empty but cheers. [laughs]

35:28.193 --> 35:30.126
-[Anissa] Cheers.
-The pizza smells great,
so let's eat.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.628
-Mmm. Thank God.
-Thank God.

35:31.663 --> 35:32.896
[Jennifer chuckles] Yeah.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.030
Wow!

37:16.802 --> 37:18.868
[grunting]

37:19.738 --> 37:21.271
[coughs, retching]

37:28.447 --> 37:30.180
[breathing heavily]

37:32.918 --> 37:35.151
Why won't you let me die?

37:36.221 --> 37:38.722
Because you still have
work to do yet.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.160
The pain.
If you wanna stop the pain,

37:44.196 --> 37:47.998
it is tied to Jefferson
or one called the Earl.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.168
[breathing heavily]
Earl is dead.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.404
I can't remember anything else
about him.

37:56.675 --> 38:00.510
Your past will give birth
to you, time and time again,

38:01.780 --> 38:05.849
until you untie the knot
of your pain.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.251
And then can I die?

38:08.286 --> 38:09.452
[chuckles softly]

38:09.488 --> 38:11.388
What the hell
are you smiling about?

38:12.658 --> 38:16.092
After knowledge
comes redemption.

38:17.529 --> 38:18.762
And then?

38:19.464 --> 38:22.065
And then you shall know peace.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.769
Peace? The hell
are you talking about?

38:27.339 --> 38:29.806
How do I get redemption?

38:29.841 --> 38:36.846
You will know after you
untie the knot
your pain has tied.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.450
[chuckles]

38:41.386 --> 38:42.419
[groaning]

38:42.454 --> 38:44.020
[echoed groaning]

38:47.993 --> 38:50.427
I was a straight-A student
before I met Tobias.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.896
[scoffs]
That was a long time ago.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.532
My entire life
could've been different.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.835
Your life? If it wasn't
for you, I'd still be alive.

38:58.870 --> 39:02.839
Me too. [scoffs]
There's no way
you'll be able to kill Tobias.

39:02.874 --> 39:06.910
You already tried to kill him
and failed, several times.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.145
How many times
has Tobias killed you?

39:10.048 --> 39:11.581
-Twice.
-[laughs]

39:14.486 --> 39:19.222
If you're gonna do this,
you gotta be smart this time.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.792
You gotta be ruthless.
You gotta be a savage.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.561
[mocking]
You gotta be a savage.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.396
Why do you think this time
is gonna be different

39:26.431 --> 39:29.032
than any other time
he's tried to murk him?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.700
Because it has to be,

39:30.736 --> 39:34.204
because I understand
everything that Tobias took
away from me and Freeland,

39:34.239 --> 39:39.175
and I'm doing this
to save Freeland.
That's gotta be my redemption.

39:39.211 --> 39:43.513
One way or another,
I'm gonna kill Tobias.

39:54.493 --> 40:00.864
Are the individuals
in this room the only ones
that know the, uh,

40:01.466 --> 40:03.500
truth about the Pierces?

40:03.535 --> 40:05.902
[female ASA technician]
Yes, sir. It couldn't be
more classified.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.037
The feed from this satellite
doesn't exist

40:08.073 --> 40:11.007
and neither does
the satellite
and its unique capabilities.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.009
[Agent Odell]
Good. Good. Good.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.879
Let's keep it that way.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.381
[female ASA technician]
Yes, sir.
