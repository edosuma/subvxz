WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.241
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.336 --> 00:03.701
I know why Brian really left.

00:03.795 --> 00:04.876
Unless you want
Faye Richardson

00:04.963 --> 00:07.170
to suddenly be made aware
of the situation,

00:07.257 --> 00:09.089
you'll make me your associate
by the end of the week.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.257
I know where
Gretchen is, Louis.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.335
She's working for me
on a temporary basis.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.419
I'm sorry.
Say that again,

00:13.514 --> 00:15.050
because my ears are a
little clogged with rage.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.756
If you just calm down,
I assure you,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.591
once I get up and running,
you can have her back.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.925
Susan made a mistake

00:20.020 --> 00:21.135
and owned up
to what she did.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.265
Is this true?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.597
It is. I made
a terrible mistake.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.729
It was a guard who was getting
suspicious of what was going on in there.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.102
They wanted me to put him
down. And then what happened?

00:30.197 --> 00:31.187
I killed him.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.363
They tied all my bonuses
to all the key dates.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.940
So you covered up a murder?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.946
I had a wife and daughter.
What was I supposed to do?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.277
I let this shit go.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.955
You're gonna sign something
saying I had nothing to do with this.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.999
Inflating my assets
to get a loan isn't shady.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.076
Everybody does it.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.628
If you involve Donna in this
deal, I will pull every string I have

00:47.714 --> 00:50.081
to tie your project up in
court for the next 20 years.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.962
Okay, see you soon.
Love you, too.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.344
Is that for me?
Why, yes, it is.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.510
A handsome coffee
for my handsome man.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.888
What do you want?

01:05.983 --> 01:08.020
Why do I have to want something
to give you a compliment?

01:08.110 --> 01:09.726
You don't,
but you do.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.356
You know you're not the
only one who can do that.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.528
You heard me on the phone
with my father, didn't you?

01:13.615 --> 01:15.572
Okay, you're the only one
who can do that.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.445
But if you're gonna
ask me to come

01:17.536 --> 01:19.652
to breakfast, I don't
think it's a great idea.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.111
But I wanna
tell him about us,

01:21.206 --> 01:22.742
and I thought we could
do it together.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.541
I get that, Donna,
but in case you forgot,

01:25.627 --> 01:26.867
the first time
I met the man,

01:26.962 --> 01:29.670
I told him if he took your
money I'd shut down his deal.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.212
Harvey, that was
a long time ago.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.961
And it was
not so long ago

01:33.051 --> 01:35.588
that he accused me of
putting you at risk over Mike.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.671
Okay, maybe it is best
if I tell him myself.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.098
But you're the two most
important men in my life,

01:41.184 --> 01:44.222
and if I tell him that I choose
you, he's not gonna hold a grudge.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.849
He's gonna be happy for us.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.686
In other words, next time,
it's the three of us.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.642
(CHUCKLES)
You bet your ass it is.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.148
And he's in town for a week,

01:53.238 --> 01:55.696
so put your big boy pants on
and find us a restaurant,

01:55.782 --> 01:58.490
or my father won't be the only
Paulsen you have to worry about.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.240
Katrina,
can I have a moment?

02:05.334 --> 02:06.369
Of course,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.121
but if you're here about
the Rose merger, you should...

02:08.211 --> 02:09.417
I'm here about
something else.

02:09.503 --> 02:11.461
The other day, you
brought Susan into my office,

02:11.548 --> 02:12.788
and I want to know why.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.212
I told you,
because I thought

02:16.303 --> 02:18.670
she deserved credit
for owning up to her mistake.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.222
And this isn't
my first rodeo.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.299
So why don't you tell me
what really happened?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.893
If it's not your first rodeo,
then you know what happened.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.266
She tried to pull something,

02:28.357 --> 02:30.394
and I brought her to you
to show her it wouldn't work.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.475
And what you should have
done is report her to me.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.059
Why? So you could fire her?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.737
I can't know what I would have
done if you don't tell me what she did.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.279
Well, that's not
going to happen, Faye,

02:38.367 --> 02:40.108
because I believe
she deserved a second chance

02:40.202 --> 02:41.818
and that I handled
the situation properly.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.780
Good.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.619
What do you mean, "good"?

02:47.709 --> 02:48.824
You saw a problem,

02:48.919 --> 02:51.627
and even though you took care
of it differently than I would have,

02:51.713 --> 02:53.044
you didn't let it slide,

02:53.131 --> 02:55.714
which makes you the
perfect woman for the job.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.708
This is a code of conduct.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.714
Which I want you
to adapt for the firm.

03:00.972 --> 03:01.962
I get it.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.298
The partners won't buy in if it
doesn't come from one of their own.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.137
No, they won't.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.477
Okay, I'll do it,
on one condition.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.183
I write the code
as I see fit.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.063
You accept it wholesale
or not at all.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.646
Another indication
I made the right choice.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.159
Tommy, what are you
doing here so early?

03:27.249 --> 03:28.785
Did something happen
with the Cooper deposition?

03:28.875 --> 03:31.833
Actually, Alex, I'm here because I
know how hard you've been working.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.878
And I think it's time
that you got a reward.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.456
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

03:40.762 --> 03:43.424
You're giving me Masterson
Construction? I am.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.802
But I thought you were
gonna give it to Craig.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.223
The thing is,
Craig's not married.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.425
What does that have
to do with it?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.262
A man with a wife and children
truly understands

03:51.356 --> 03:53.142
what it's like to be
a member of a family.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.394
So |I getto
jump him in line

03:54.484 --> 03:56.145
because I was fortunate enough
to fall in love?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.689
That's how it works
in corporate America, Alex.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.192
Maybe it is, but I still don't
want to do this to Craig.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.648
Well, if it'll make
you feel better,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.735
whether you take Masterson or
not, Craig is not going to get them.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.828
Tommy... Tell you
what. Just think about it.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.121
If you feel the same way
tomorrow, I'll...

04:10.208 --> 04:11.494
I'll get someone else.

04:16.505 --> 04:20.124
CRAIG: Not bad, if you're into
million-dollar views, that is.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.209
It's not much,
but it's home.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.678
Good to see you, Craig.
You, too, Alex.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.723
Look, this isn't easy for
me, so I'm just gonna say it.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.557
I need a favor.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.518
Anything.
Just name it.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.145
Your lawsuit against
Panasonic. Do you know it?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.599
I've heard a few things,
but they're not my client.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.683
Why?

04:37.778 --> 04:38.984
Because they're my client.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.607
There's an offer on the table,
and I need your firm to take it.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.063
And if what I heard
about that offer is true,

04:43.158 --> 04:45.115
that's not a favor,
that's tanking a case.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.614
Are you really gonna
make me say it?

04:47.704 --> 04:50.196
You took my place in line,
and I never recovered.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.325
You owe me.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.204
And whether you believe it
or not, I don't owe you.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.797
Here's what I have
to say about that.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.042
What is that?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.628
CRAIG: That is
Masterson Construction.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.508
I know all about it,
Alex.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.181
I don't know what
you're talking about.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.678
CRAIG: You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.761
Tommy Bratton may have
chained me to a desk for 10 years,

05:13.855 --> 05:15.471
but he left me
with a parting gift.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.191
I know you covered up
a conspiracy.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.268
And if you know all that,
you know I was framed.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.853
That doesn't mean
that this can't hurt you,

05:22.948 --> 05:25.861
especially in light of
your firm's recent troubles.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.322
I need this to close
by the end of the week.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.994
So get it done,
or that gets out.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.742
And then you can explain
to everyone you know

05:32.833 --> 05:34.574
what kind of man
you really are.

05:39.798 --> 05:43.041
(SINGING) See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

05:43.134 --> 05:46.217
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

05:46.304 --> 05:49.842
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

05:49.933 --> 05:53.142
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

05:53.228 --> 05:56.391
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

05:56.481 --> 05:58.188
Me and missy is so early

05:58.275 --> 05:59.936
Busy, busy making money

06:00.026 --> 06:01.016
All right!

06:01.570 --> 06:06.064
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

06:07.534 --> 06:09.320
The greenback boogie

06:11.538 --> 06:12.903
All right,
you sons of bitches.

06:12.998 --> 06:13.988
Excuse me?

06:14.082 --> 06:17.040
Excuse yourself, asshole,
'cause you just had the B team.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.414
Now you get the A team.
You're gonna sue us?

06:19.504 --> 06:21.745
You don't sue us.
We sue you.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.964
I'm gonna have your balls
in a vise so tight,

06:24.050 --> 06:25.916
you're gonna wish you
were born without balls.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.342
That's right, lady,
I'm talking to you.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.591
I'm gonna shove this lawsuit
so far up your ass

06:29.681 --> 06:30.967
you're gonna be
the first lawyer in history

06:31.057 --> 06:33.014
to die with a lawsuit
in her ass.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.307
I'm gonna burn you
to the ground.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.180
I'm gonna do a rain dance
on your ashes.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.182
Nobody messes with Louis Litt,

06:38.273 --> 06:41.982
least of all two slobs from
the firm Shitty and Shithead.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.689
We're not lawyers.

06:44.905 --> 06:45.895
What happened?

06:45.989 --> 06:46.979
We're Susan's parents.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.905
She said we could visit.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.029
She said the people here
were so nice.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.493
Well, of course
you're Susan's parents.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.412
You look exactly like her.
Job well done.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.488
She's very attractive.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.073
Not in a cause-of-action
type of way.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.001
I'm just giving you a mock
example of how not to behave

07:01.087 --> 07:02.703
when Susan's parents
are in the conference room.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.539
(LAUGHS) Holy shit. Carry on.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.757
Oh, hey,
if anybody asks,

07:10.847 --> 07:12.087
my name really
isn't Louis Litt.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.263
It's Alex Williams.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.973
Gretchen, I need you back.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.554
Good morning
to you, too, Louis.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.060
I don't have time
for good mornings.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.265
I just went to
Conference Room C

07:23.360 --> 07:24.475
and ripped them
a new asshole.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.559
Conference Room C?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.110
Louis, those are
Susan's parents.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.608
I didn't know they were
Susan's parents.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.689
I was supposed to be
in Conference Room A, not C.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.320
Those letters have nothing
to do with each other.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.946
Then why'd you go
to the wrong room?

07:34.037 --> 07:36.199
Because Norma's granddaughter
is temping on my desk.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.280
You know what her name is?
Norma Ill.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.365
Who does that?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.245
On top of which, she has all
of her grandmother's body odor

07:41.336 --> 07:42.326
and none of her competence.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.376
I'd be better off
with the urn.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.995
Louis. Gretchen,
I cannot take it.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.377
I need to know how long
Faye's gonna keep you.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.753
Louis, there's only one way

07:48.843 --> 07:50.299
I can think to get
an answer on that,

07:50.387 --> 07:53.550
but that's gonna require huge
amounts of time and effort on your part.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.630
What is it?

07:54.724 --> 07:56.806
Go to her goddamn office
and ask her.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.261
Well, in that case,
I need some time to regather.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.607
Hi, Dad.
Good to see you, sweetheart.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.688
You, too.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.606
Thank you for
making time for breakfast.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.736
Of course.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.068
Actually, your timing
is perfect

08:16.162 --> 08:19.405
because I have some news,
and it is so much better in person.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.287
This is exciting. Don't
keep me in suspense.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.744
Harvey and I have
started seeing each other.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.461
Congratulations, Donna.
That's... great news.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.669
All right, let's get it out.
Let's hear your misgivings.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.878
Who says
I have misgivings?

08:34.972 --> 08:36.462
Your face,
your body language,

08:36.558 --> 08:39.471
the way you said "congratulations”
as if I had just put my dog down.

08:39.561 --> 08:40.892
All right, then.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.890
Donna, from everything
you've told me over the years,

08:42.981 --> 08:44.437
the man can be selfish.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.231
Dad, if this has to do
with Mike Ross,

08:46.317 --> 08:48.604
Harvey would throw himself
in front of a train for me.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.026
And I don't doubt that.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.899
I just think you deserve
to be with somebody

08:51.990 --> 08:54.527
who can put your needs
above his own,

08:54.617 --> 08:57.029
not only when it comes to
matters of life and death.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.657
You know, I told Harvey
that when you heard the news,

08:59.748 --> 09:00.909
you'd be happy for me,

09:02.042 --> 09:03.407
that he just didn't know you.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.504
Sweetheart, you're one of
the smartest women I know.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.501
I trust your judgment.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.459
If you're happy,
I'm happy for you.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.386
Well, it doesn't feel
that way. Then I'm sorry.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.676
Can we start
this breakfast over?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.016
Sure, Dad.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.677
Sure.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.022
What the fuck?

09:31.613 --> 09:32.899
You're taking Masterson?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.401
Craig, before you say
anything, I tried to say no.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.324
And that's the kind of thing
that someone says

09:37.410 --> 09:38.992
when they didn't try at all.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.327
I thought we were friends.
We are.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.280
And I'm telling you, he wasn't
gonna give them to you anyway.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.580
Why not?
According to Bratton,

09:44.667 --> 09:46.157
it's because I have
a wife and kids.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.956
That is bullshit. And I'm
not the one who said it, he is.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.879
But put yourself in my
shoes. What would you do?

09:50.965 --> 09:52.046
I would have gone to you

09:52.133 --> 09:54.124
and told you before you
heard it through the grapevine.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.254
Craig, I was working
on something.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.881
Well, you're too late,
because now I gotta go

09:56.971 --> 09:58.632
figure out some other way
to make my bonus this year.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.713
Listen to me.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.640
What I was working on
was getting the go-ahead

10:01.726 --> 10:04.058
to split Mayfield Foods
with you. We can share them.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.557
Mayfield Foods is a tenth
the size of Masterson.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.730
So keep your bullshit gestures
to yourself, okay?

10:08.817 --> 10:11.309
Because I don't need any
phony friends looking out for me.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.458
(KNOCKS)

10:29.295 --> 10:30.956
Samantha,
do you have a minute?

10:31.548 --> 10:33.334
Depends.
How important is it?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.791
Important. Craig
Cameron came to see me.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.960
He's an old friend,
and he needs a favor.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.011
Well, that favor better have
nothing to do with Panasonic.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.714
Look, I know there's
a deal on the table, Samantha,

10:41.808 --> 10:42.969
and I need you to take it.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.594
This guy isn't your friend. He's
got something on you, doesn't he?

10:46.688 --> 10:48.770
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.598
And you didn't come in here
to get me to take the deal.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.683
You came here to get me
to bury your secret.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.565
I came here because I thought
this goddamn thing had gone away.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.363
This is the prison thing
with Bratton, isn't it?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.233
You know. Alex, I was
Robert's fixer. Of course I know.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.488
Then take the deal
that's on the table.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.614
I can't.
Why not?

11:03.705 --> 11:06.163
Because it's a shitty deal and
everyone knows it, including Faye,

11:06.249 --> 11:07.364
which means if I take it,

11:07.458 --> 11:09.415
sooner or later,
she's gonna figure out why.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.584
God damn it, Samantha,
I covered up a crime.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.662
Because you were framed.
It doesn't matter.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.381
Why not? Because I
let them get away with it.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.920
I may have been framed, but I
let them get away with murder.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.094
Samantha,
I have two daughters.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.305
I don't want them going through
life knowing that about their father.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.683
What about Rosalie?
What does she think?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.024
She doesn't know,
does she?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.100
No.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.438
Then you are gonna go home tonight
and tell your wife the whole story.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.242
What are you doing
in my office, Faye?

11:44.329 --> 11:46.161
I'm here because
it's come to my attention

11:46.247 --> 11:49.365
that you and Harvey Specter
are in a relationship.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.325
And how exactly did that
come to your attention?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.911
The question is, what are
we going to do about it?

11:54.505 --> 11:56.212
Are you asking if we're
planning on getting married?

11:56.299 --> 11:58.711
"Cause I'm sorry to tell you
you're not on the guest list.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.418
And our relationship
is none of your business.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.630
Donna, when two of
the five members of management

12:04.724 --> 12:08.137
have undue influence over each
other, something needs to be done.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.310
What exactly are you
trying to tell me, Faye?

12:10.396 --> 12:12.182
That you have to give up
your vote.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.059
Excuse me?
It's a clear conflict.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.391
No law firm would allow
this to stand.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.649
Okay, let's just put aside the
fact that I think that's bullshit.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.231
Are you saying that Harvey's
vote is more important than mine?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.315
Yes, I am.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.572
He's a senior partner
and a former managing partner.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.404
I see what this is.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.040
You keep trying to diminish
my role here.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.419
Last week, it was trying
to make me a secretary again.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.246
Now you're trying
to make me nothing.

12:37.340 --> 12:40.173
I'm trying to preserve the
interests of this law firm.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.001
And if you want to
take it up with Harvey

12:42.095 --> 12:44.757
and he thinks your value here
is higher than his,

12:44.847 --> 12:46.804
he can certainly give up
his vote instead of you.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.974
But as of right now,
the next time there's a vote,

12:50.061 --> 12:52.177
only one of you
is going to have one.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.662
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.332
Actually, I am in the middle of
something, so if you don't mind...

13:14.419 --> 13:15.534
I got it.
You're busy.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.086
I just wanted to know
how your breakfast went.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.788
It wasn't great, Harvey.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.545
He said if I'm happy,
he's happy,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.421
but if the two of you
can't figure out a way

13:24.512 --> 13:27.004
to share a meal together,
then what the hell are we doing?

13:27.098 --> 13:30.716
Whoa. Hold a second.
"What are we doing?"

13:30.810 --> 13:32.175
Are you saying
you want to end this?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.557
No, Harvey, I am saying
that I want a relationship

13:34.647 --> 13:36.934
with someone who, at some
point, will get along with my father.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.936
Donna, he said
he was happy for you.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.439
It's not the biggest deal in
the world if we don't get along.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.361
You mean like the way that you
didn't get along with your mother

13:43.448 --> 13:44.404
for most of your life?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.318
That has nothing to
do with this. Doesn't it?

13:46.409 --> 13:48.400
Have you even told your
mother about us? Donna...

13:48.494 --> 13:49.984
Well, I will
take that as a no.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.988
I didn't tell her
because I didn't think to.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.197
DONNA:
And you didn't think to

13:54.292 --> 13:57.125
because your mother hasn't
been a regular part of your life.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.999
But my father's been
a regular part of mine,

14:00.089 --> 14:02.456
and I shouldn't have to give up
something that's important to me

14:02.550 --> 14:04.632
just because I'm in
a relationship with you.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.967
Donna, is... Is there
something else going on?

14:13.102 --> 14:15.218
Isn't my father enough,
Harvey?

14:15.313 --> 14:16.929
He said that you
wouldn't put me first.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.058
Well, putting me first

14:18.149 --> 14:20.186
would mean fixing
your relationship with him.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.266
So,

14:22.195 --> 14:25.404
if you can't figure out a way to
do that, then maybe he's right.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.785
LOUIS: There she is.
There's my black swan.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.203
Louis, this is
the women's room.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.663
Why do you think
I'm in here? I don't...

14:35.750 --> 14:37.366
Are you writing a code
of conduct for Faye?

14:37.460 --> 14:38.950
Yes.
How did you know that?

14:39.045 --> 14:41.787
Because I found this draft on
her desk with your name on it.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.121
You went through
her things?

14:43.216 --> 14:45.127
No, I went in there to ask when
I could have Gretchen back,

14:45.218 --> 14:47.880
but now I don't have to ask because
you're gonna get her back for me.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.214
"Personnel reassignments are the
sole purview of the name partners."

14:52.308 --> 14:53.924
Louis, that isn't
a code of conduct.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.133
That belongs in the bylaws.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.469
Doesn't matter where it goes. You
put it in there, I get Gretchen back.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.606
Louis, I don't feel good about
sneaking something in like this.

15:01.692 --> 15:05.276
Katrina, please. This woman
has taken everything from me.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.821
I need this,
and I need you.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.695
Okay, Louis.
I'll see what I can do.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.788
Harvey.
What a pleasant surprise.

15:20.878 --> 15:21.868
HARVEY: (ON PHONE) Hey, Mom.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.330
Do you remember when I told
you about a very special person

15:24.424 --> 15:26.335
who was responsible
for us reconciling?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.416
LILY: I do.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.421
I also remember
putting my foot in my mouth

15:29.512 --> 15:31.298
when I thought that person
was Paula.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.505
HARVEY: (CHUCKLES)
Well, her name is Donna.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.215
We've been seeing each other,

15:35.893 --> 15:39.602
and I haven't exactly
told her yet, but...

15:42.942 --> 15:43.932
She's the one.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.563
Harvey, that's fantastic.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.396
I have been rooting for you and
Donna to get together for years.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.572
What? How do you
even know who she is?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.947
Because you have a brother
who's as big a fan of hers as I am.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.700
I am so happy for you, Harvey.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.455
Thanks, Mom.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.626
Why do I get the sense
there's something else?

16:03.713 --> 16:06.205
HARVEY: Nothing. It's just, her
father and I have some history,

16:06.299 --> 16:08.040
and he's not exactly
crazy about me.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.582
I'm not sure
what to do about it.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.920
LILY: Harvey, you may rub
some people the wrong way,

16:13.014 --> 16:14.379
but you have a generous heart.

16:14.724 --> 16:18.467
Go to him. Make some kind of
gesture. I'm sure it'll work out.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.768
And what if it doesn't? LILY:
Then you have him call me.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.142
I'll tell him
my unbiased opinion

16:23.232 --> 16:25.644
about what an amazing man
my son is.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.354
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

16:28.112 --> 16:29.398
(DOOR CLOSES)

16:30.490 --> 16:31.480
Hey.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.106
Hey.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.322
You look like
you had a rough day.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.527
I did.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.080
Then come here. I wanna
show you something.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.001
(GRUNTS)

16:45.713 --> 16:48.000
ROSALIE: (ON SPEAKERS)
Oh, you're such a big girl. You got it.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.674
(LAUGHS) Holy shit. She did it.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.590
She walked.
Oh, she didn't just walk.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.466
She sauntered.
Look at that again.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.847
Alex, what's going on?

17:02.980 --> 17:06.018
A few weeks ago, I visited
one of Masterson's sites

17:06.108 --> 17:08.520
and a guard
slipped me a note.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.310
It said an inmate died
when a scaffolding broke

17:11.405 --> 17:13.771
and the prison
has been covering it up.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.277
Oh, my God.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.116
I started looking into it.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.912
Then, today, when I tried
to call the guard at home,

17:21.915 --> 17:24.282
his wife said he had been
killed by an inmate.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.994
So are you saying
they're connected?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.710
"Cause it's one thing to
hide an accidental death,

17:30.800 --> 17:33.792
but it's a whole other thing to
orchestrate the murder of a guard.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.218
I know.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.006
But either way, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.886
You are a good man,
Alex Williams.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.562
(CHUCKLES)

17:48.776 --> 17:51.564
But, hey,
email that video, will you?

17:51.654 --> 17:52.860
Already did.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.153
(BOTH MOAN)

17:57.368 --> 17:58.699
(DOOR CLOSES)

18:03.791 --> 18:05.498
ROSALIE: Hey, you hungry?

18:06.127 --> 18:07.333
I ate at the office.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.374
Wanted to make sure the girls
were asleep before I got home.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.005
Well, I don't like
the sound of that.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.378
What's going on?

18:15.136 --> 18:16.718
Do you remember when
I was at Bratton Gould

18:16.804 --> 18:18.715
and I found out
that guard had been killed?

18:18.806 --> 18:20.046
Yeah, of course.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.514
Well, I didn't tell you
the whole story.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.303
They were extending
prisoner sentences for profit,

18:27.273 --> 18:28.855
and they killed that guard
to cover it up.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.648
What? Wait,
but you told me...

18:30.735 --> 18:32.601
I know what I told you,
Rosalie.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.444
I lied.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.819
Because when I went to Tommy
Bratton, I found out he was in on it

18:38.909 --> 18:41.742
and he made it look like
I was in on it, too.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.078
Why are you
telling me this now?

18:44.165 --> 18:45.997
Because a former colleague
of mine found out,

18:46.083 --> 18:48.666
and if Samantha doesn't
tank a case against him,

18:48.753 --> 18:49.788
he's going to expose me.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.337
So let me get this straight,
you left me out of this back then,

18:52.423 --> 18:54.539
and you only telling me now
because you got caught?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.124
I left you out
to protect you.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.381
No, you left me out because you knew
I would have told you to come forward.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.258
They framed me, Rosalie.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.511
If I came forward,
I was going to prison, too.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.638
And for what? It wasn't gonna
bring those two people back.

19:05.728 --> 19:09.562
You said they were extending
sentences. People of color.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.731
It's what we talked about
back in law school,

19:11.817 --> 19:13.524
and you just let them
keep right on doing it?

19:13.611 --> 19:15.067
You think it didn't
kill me to do that?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.316
I wouldn't know what it did to you
because you didn't bother to tell me.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.771
Rosalie...
Look, sorry, Alex,

19:18.866 --> 19:22.404
but forgive me if I need
a minute to process

19:22.495 --> 19:24.907
that not only were you
involved in something like this,

19:24.997 --> 19:27.113
but you didn't trust me enough
to tell me about it.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.376
Faye, do you have a
minute? FAYE: Of course.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.427
Did you think about
our conversation yesterday?

19:41.514 --> 19:44.848
As a matter of fact, I did, and I
decided to take you at your word.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.174
How's that?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.100
That you're serving
the interests of the firm.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.772
So I'm here to explain how Harvey
and I both having a vote serves the firm.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.641
Donna... We don't just
influence each other,

19:54.735 --> 19:56.021
we balance each other.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.069
We make each other consider
opposing points of view,

19:58.155 --> 20:00.943
and then, in the end, we do what
we think will make the firm stronger,

20:01.033 --> 20:02.398
whether we're
in agreement or not.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.029
FAYE: And I don't doubt
that's true,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.657
but your individual
circumstances don't matter.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.034
Okay, let's just get to it.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.745
Is this because
of you and your ex-husband?

20:11.836 --> 20:12.871
Excuse me?

20:12.962 --> 20:14.919
You act like this isn't
personal, but I think it is.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.043
You don't know anything
about my ex-husband.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.252
I know that you had a conflict at
work and he ended up getting fired.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.087
But Harvey and I aren't you,

20:24.181 --> 20:26.593
and I don't appreciate
you making us into you.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.470
And this isn't
a negotiation.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.472
This is
a conflict of interest,

20:30.563 --> 20:32.224
and I will not be cajoled,

20:32.314 --> 20:35.056
threatened, or coerced
into thinking it's not.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.609
As I said, who gives up
their vote is your call,

20:37.695 --> 20:39.811
but make a decision
by tomorrow

20:39.905 --> 20:41.236
or I'll make one for you.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.033
JIM: (LAUGHING) Next thing
you know, she won the whole thing.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.828
Wow. I didn't even know she
skied, much less competitively.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.751
Well, once she got serious about theater,
she gave it up and never looked back.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.500
HARVEY: James, I appreciate you
seeing me, and I love these stories,

20:58.591 --> 21:01.959
but I also know that
you have concerns about me

21:03.345 --> 21:07.509
and I wanted you to know that I've
taken some steps to alleviate them.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.262
I appreciate that, Harvey,
and I have to say,

21:10.352 --> 21:12.559
inviting me to talk
man-to-man is a great start.

21:12.646 --> 21:16.355
Well, if you like that,
then you're gonna love this.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.314
I know you're in town for a deal
and you haven't gotten any bites yet.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.487
Well, that's not
just a bite. It's a meal.

21:24.575 --> 21:25.565
What?

21:28.287 --> 21:31.029
I pulled some strings,
but it's everything you need.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.832
I don't believe this.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.994
You dug into my business
without asking me?

21:38.088 --> 21:39.419
James, I'm just
trying to help.

21:39.507 --> 21:40.747
And if I did
the same thing to you,

21:40.841 --> 21:42.957
would you think it was
because I was trying to help

21:43.052 --> 21:44.417
or trying to buy
your approval?

21:44.512 --> 21:45.547
I'm not trying
to buy anything.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.754
No, you're just giving me a bunch
of money and asking me to like you.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.179
James, it was a gesture.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.473
And I know what you think
of me, but you're overreacting.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.726
You know what, Harvey?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.929
Instead of focusing
on what I'm doing,

21:56.816 --> 21:58.898
why don't you give
some thought to who you are?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.229
And if that's too much,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.778
at least treat my daughter
better than you treat me.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.235
Well?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.616
I'm sorry, Louis.
I can't do it.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.696
Why the hell not?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.532
Because I decided
I don't want to violate

22:15.626 --> 22:17.367
the spirit of what I'm
trying to do with this code.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.543
I don't believe this. Whose
goddamn side are you on?

22:19.630 --> 22:20.791
Don't you say that to me.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.340
There's a reason we got
saddled with Faye in the first place,

22:24.426 --> 22:26.212
and we keep doing
shit like this?

22:26.303 --> 22:27.543
We will never be rid of her.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.845
Well, isn't that the pot
calling the kettle black?

22:29.932 --> 22:33.050
Because that's exactly the type of
thing that you used to be on board with.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.430
Yes, Louis. "Used to."

22:35.521 --> 22:37.182
Because I've come to terms
with the kind of lawyer

22:37.273 --> 22:39.105
I want to be,
and it isn't this.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.556
Oh, God damn it, Katrina,
don't you get it?

22:40.651 --> 22:41.641
She took Gretchen.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.066
We don't put a stop
to her now,

22:43.153 --> 22:45.645
we won't even have a say
over what kind of pencils we use.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.606
I don't want her to have Gretchen
any more than you do, Louis,

22:48.701 --> 22:51.784
but don't you ever
use our friendship

22:51.871 --> 22:54.329
to try to get me to do
something like this again.

23:04.133 --> 23:07.171
Tommy, I need to talk about
Masterson, and it can't wait.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.840
I'm sorry, Alex. I'm just
heading home, and I'm in a hurry.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.179
Catch me tomorrow. I
just told you this can't wait.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.256
What?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.258
A guard gave that to me.

23:15.352 --> 23:18.515
The next day, I called Pat
Krueger, and now that guard is dead.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.102
This whole thing
is a conspiracy.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.308
They've been using inmates
and extending sentences,

23:24.403 --> 23:25.518
and we need to stop it.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.071
No, we don't.
We're their lawyers, Alex.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.238
And they're breaking
the law.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.315
And do you have
proof of that?

23:30.409 --> 23:31.399
I have that letter.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.235
The one that you had for weeks
and you didn't take to the authorities?

23:34.330 --> 23:35.786
Are you saying I have
something to do with this?

23:35.873 --> 23:37.910
You're the one that got
them to sign off on the waiver

23:38.000 --> 23:41.243
allowing the inmates to do
Masterson's construction.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.546
Which, as I recall,
you got a big, fat bonus for.

23:44.632 --> 23:45.713
You gave me that bonus.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.541
It didn't come from me.
It came from Masterson,

23:48.636 --> 23:52.504
as did the one I believe
you just got yesterday,

23:52.598 --> 23:55.431
exactly five days
after that guard died.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.848
I didn't get any bonus
yesterday.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.678
Well, it's 'cause you haven't
checked your account yet.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.638
Trust me, it's there.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.018
I get it.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.476
You didn't give Masterson to me
because I'm more stable than Craig.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.028
You gave it to me because
I'm more vulnerable than Craig.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.230
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

24:11.325 --> 24:14.943
but you'd better think very
carefully about coming forward,

24:15.037 --> 24:19.247
because a murder was committed
here and you do have a family.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.334
So I trust you're gonna do
the right thing, Alex.

24:33.764 --> 24:34.879
Rosalie.

24:35.724 --> 24:36.805
What are you doing here?

24:36.892 --> 24:38.257
You know
what I'm doing here.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.263
Alex told you.
He did.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.642
I don't like that it took him
eight years to do it,

24:43.732 --> 24:44.893
but now that he has...

24:44.984 --> 24:46.440
You need someone
to talk to about it.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.734
No, I need to do
something about it.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.439
Look, I understand
that you're upset,

24:52.533 --> 24:54.399
but Alex had his reasons.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.951
And if you think I'm here to figure
out what to do with my husband,

24:57.037 --> 24:58.027
then you don't know me.

24:58.372 --> 25:01.034
Nobody threatens my man
and gets away with it.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.618
Rosalie, what exactly
do you want from me?

25:04.712 --> 25:07.170
I want your help figuring out
how to get something on this guy.

25:07.256 --> 25:10.044
I respect your point of view,
but there's another way.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.466
Okay, what way?
Call his bluff.

25:12.553 --> 25:14.794
He may not follow through,
and even if he does...

25:14.888 --> 25:17.129
Are you kidding me?
Alex could lose everything.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.714
I can't take
that kind of risk.

25:18.809 --> 25:21.176
And there's a different kind of
risk to what you're talking about.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.681
I don't care.
You can't do this.

25:22.771 --> 25:26.389
Samantha, he is
the father of my children.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.315
I can't let this
happen to him.

25:31.655 --> 25:35.319
All right. I'll help you
find something on this guy.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.946
Can I get you a cup of coffee,
or are you all coffee'd out?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.326
Donna...
I can't believe it.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.578
You went and you stuck
your nose into his deal.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.875
Because I was trying to make
up with him, like you asked me.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.168
Harvey,
don't you get it?

25:48.255 --> 25:52.089
Your history is you making it clear to
him that you think he's a bad businessman.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.543
I was just giving him
some help.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.593
No, you showed him
that you don't respect him,

25:56.680 --> 25:57.886
that you think
you're better than him.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.556
And as far as I'm concerned,
you think you're better than me.

26:01.185 --> 26:02.641
Donna, what's going on?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.093
Because maybe I messed up,

26:04.188 --> 26:06.600
but you know I don't think
I'm better than you.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.556
Maybe you don't, Harvey,

26:09.610 --> 26:11.396
but Faye does.
What are you talking about?

26:11.487 --> 26:13.728
She said that since we're together,
one of us has to give up their vote,

26:13.822 --> 26:15.529
and that one of us is me.

26:15.616 --> 26:16.981
What?
Why didn't you tell me?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.157
Because I didn't want
to hear you say

26:18.243 --> 26:19.449
that your vote
is more important than mine.

26:19.536 --> 26:20.526
I wouldn't have
said that.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.578
I would have put a stop to it,
which I'm gonna do right now.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.663
LOUIS: Good, you're both
here. What is it now, Louis?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.161
We need to do something
about Faye.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.413
She took Gretchen and now
she's turned Katrina against me.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.835
Well, I'm sorry, Louis,

26:29.922 --> 26:31.412
but right now we have
bigger fish to fry,

26:31.507 --> 26:33.669
because Faye said
Donna has to lose her vote

26:33.759 --> 26:35.249
because we're seeing
each other.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.550
That's bullshit.
She can't do that.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.635
Which is what I'm about
to tell her. No, you're not.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.838
Well, then, I'm coming with you.
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.425
You're not coming anywhere.
We only have so much leverage.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.181
Donna losing her vote trumps
you getting Gretchen back,

26:46.271 --> 26:47.682
and we have to
pick our battles.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.480
And what a surprise, the
battle we're picking is yours.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.806
Well, I'm not having it.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.814
I say we go in there as a united
front and get it all back at once.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.690
And I say we wouldn't have
to go in there at all

26:55.781 --> 26:57.692
if you hadn't let her into
our house in the first place.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.065
Harvey. What'd
you just say to me?

26:59.159 --> 27:00.900
You heard me.
You let her in here,

27:00.994 --> 27:03.156
and you didn't even put up
an ounce of resistance.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.863
Are you fucking kidding me?

27:04.957 --> 27:07.995
She's here because Robert Zane
fell on his sword for you.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.667
And let's just go back
a little further.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.994
She also wouldn't be here if
Jessica hadn't been disbarred,

27:12.089 --> 27:14.421
which only happened
because you hired Mike Ross.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.000
So if you want to blame
someone for Faye being here,

27:17.094 --> 27:19.131
look in the goddamn mirror!

27:22.266 --> 27:23.631
Let him go.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.967
And while you're at it,
let this whole Faye thing go.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.390
Donna...
Harvey, look at us.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.471
We are at each other's
throats over this woman,

27:30.566 --> 27:31.601
and it's just not worth it.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.148
I know that, but...
No "buts."

27:33.235 --> 27:34.396
My vote is important to me,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.443
but this woman isn't
gonna be here forever.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.942

you're coming right back
to where it all started.

I didn't mean to say those
things to you, Harvey. I'm sorry.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.134
It's okay, Louis.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.686
I already let it go because
I know why you said them.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.939
Before you came in,
Donna and I were arguing.

She made me see that I wasn't
treating her father with respect.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.729
And then I did the same thing to
you, and that's why you lashed out.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.694
I guess it is.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.195
The thing is,
Louis,

28:24.286 --> 28:26.323
we haven't been treating
each other with respect

28:26.413 --> 28:28.950
because Faye hasn't been
treating any of us with respect.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.531
But I think I know
how to stop it.

28:30.626 --> 28:31.832

in the first place.

just a coincidence.

new Reform Corp project.

something. Yeah, Mayfield Foods.

they're not big enough.

gonna make my quarter.

you don't want Masterson.

That's bullshit! I've wanted
Masterson for a year and a half.

you've done nothing

us with open disrespect.

have that thrown in my face.

treated the way you treated her.

from you.

you're gonna do that.

end up in prison.

I'll take your deal.
Oh, it's too late for that.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.106
(CHUCKLES) I couldn't
exactly refuse.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.778
Not just to make peace.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.781
I wanted to show what I
hadn't shown you before.

36:02.452 --> 36:03.567
Respect.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.907
Not sure I understand
where you're going with this.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.454
I like to think
I'm a smart guy,

36:08.541 --> 36:11.454
but sometimes, I don't see
what's right in front of my face.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.582
I thought I was
showing you I cared,

36:14.673 --> 36:18.337
but instead, maybe it seemed
like I don't respect you.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.463
Donna told you that,
didn't she?

36:20.553 --> 36:22.339
She did, and if you're
anything like me,

36:22.430 --> 36:26.765
you might not have been aware
that that's what was going on for you.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.265
Sounds like you two are a
lot like me and her mother.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.772
James, you have
an amazing marriage.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.440
You've raised
a wonderful daughter,

36:35.527 --> 36:38.645
and you've had love
in your life all this time.

36:40.448 --> 36:43.281
If that's not something to
respect, then I don't know what is.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.069
And Donna once told me about when
you and her mother were separated

36:47.163 --> 36:48.574
and what you did
to get her back.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.622
That's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.208
I wouldn't have taken you
for the romantic type.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.331
That's because I've never
shown you I was.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.504
I'm sorry if
I overreacted, Harvey.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.425
And maybe I am something
like you, because...

37:03.722 --> 37:06.054
I didn't see it
for what it was either.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.050
And since you shared
with me, I'll share with you.

37:10.186 --> 37:14.020
I'm up against it with this
deal, and if it's not too late,

37:14.733 --> 37:16.690
I could really use your help.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.276
It's not too late, James.

You went to see Craig,
didn't you? And what if I did?

37:39.048 --> 37:40.709
I'd like to know why,

37:40.800 --> 37:43.292
because I thought I made it
clear I wanted to do it myself.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.340
There were a lot of reasons,
Rosalie, not the least of which

37:46.431 --> 37:49.674
is the two of you were too
emotional to see it clearly.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.137
The two of us?
Yes, the two of you,

37:52.228 --> 37:53.810
because Alex figured out
you came to me,

37:53.897 --> 37:56.935
and he wanted to save you as
much as you wanted to save him.

37:57.567 --> 38:00.355
But I knew if I was the one
to put that gun on the table,

38:00.987 --> 38:02.819
we might just get away
with not having to fire it.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.188
Why not? Because
I've done it before.

38:07.577 --> 38:08.988
And what were the others?

38:09.537 --> 38:11.778
"The others"?
The other reasons.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.204
You welcomed me into
your home the other night

38:16.294 --> 38:18.251
and I saw what you had,

38:18.338 --> 38:19.999
what you had to lose.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.331
I've never had that.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.927
I wanted to protect it.

38:27.597 --> 38:30.214
You are one hell of a woman,
Samantha Wheeler.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.219
Well, I don't know
about that.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.300
ALEX: Well, I do.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.352
Thank you, Samantha.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.934
From the both of us.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.274
You are
both welcome.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.275
What do you say you
come over to our house

38:46.366 --> 38:48.152
for a late-night game
of Settlers of Catan?

38:48.243 --> 38:49.233
Mmm.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.325
What the hell is that?

38:51.621 --> 38:53.237
Just some good family
fun. (CHUCKLES)

38:53.331 --> 38:54.662
(CHUCKLES)

38:54.749 --> 38:57.161
Well, maybe you should spend
the evening with your family.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.913
Who's to say we wouldn't be?

39:03.466 --> 39:06.504
Anyway, we haven't talked
recently as much as I'd like,

39:06.594 --> 39:08.835
and I guess I was just
missing my friend.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.717
Give me a call
when you can.

39:11.808 --> 39:12.843
(DOOR OPENS)

39:12.934 --> 39:15.301
I love you, Rachel. Bye.

39:15.395 --> 39:16.806
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

39:16.896 --> 39:18.011
Hey.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.063
Where've you been?

39:20.525 --> 39:23.563
I went to go thank you for
taking care of me with Faye

39:23.653 --> 39:24.768
but you were gone.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.353
I had to take care
of something else.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.859
Why are you smiling?

39:29.117 --> 39:30.278
Because your dad loves me.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.526
You made it right with him?
I did.

39:32.620 --> 39:35.282
And before you tell me
how happy you are with me,

39:35.373 --> 39:36.659
I have something to say.

39:38.042 --> 39:41.580
You said I needed to share
when I disagree with you,

39:41.671 --> 39:43.457
but if we're gonna
make this work,

39:43.923 --> 39:45.334
you also have to come to me

39:45.425 --> 39:47.837
when something is going
wrong in your life.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.213
Are you talking about Faye?

39:49.304 --> 39:52.171
You can't keep things like her
going after your vote from me.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.256
Even if you don't want me
to do anything about it,

39:54.350 --> 39:55.806
you need to trust me with it.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.184
You're right.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.428
I'm sorry.

40:02.483 --> 40:03.473
I'll try.

40:04.444 --> 40:05.434
Come here.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.450
Wait a second.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.778
What do you mean
"if" this is gonna work?

40:16.873 --> 40:19.535
Donna, you know we're gonna
be together forever, right?

40:19.626 --> 40:21.037
Well, not if that's how
you're gonna ask me.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.376
Doesn't matter how
I ask you. Why not?

40:23.463 --> 40:25.830
Because we both know
however I ask,

40:25.924 --> 40:28.916
it won't be exactly the way you
would have instructed me to ask,

40:29.010 --> 40:31.468
so might as well ask you
any way I want.

40:31.554 --> 40:32.885
Well... Uh...

40:33.848 --> 40:35.714
That, uh... (SIGHS)
Go ahead.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.424
Okay... (CHUCKLES)
Keep stumbling.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.473
That's only the second time I've
ever seen you at a loss for words.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.220
So, we're engaged, then?

40:42.315 --> 40:44.101
Well, I...
(CHUCKLES MOCKINGLY)

40:44.192 --> 40:46.809
No, it's...
Look who's stumbling now.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.361
No, it's just, I never
considered marriage part of...

40:49.447 --> 40:51.404
Part of what?
Being together forever?

40:51.491 --> 40:53.107
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Sweet baby Jesus.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.535
I never thought I'd say this, but
thank God, my mom is calling.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.828
Mom, how can I help you?

40:58.957 --> 41:01.824
Maybe you need me to come up
there a few days? (CHUCKLES)

41:01.918 --> 41:05.036
LILY: I just wanted to see how
it turned out with Donna's dad.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.210
It went great.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.540
In fact, there's someone here
I'd like to introduce you to.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.961
Mom, meet Donna.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.592
Donna, meet Lily.

41:16.975 --> 41:20.513
Lily, you have no idea how long
I have been wanting to meet you.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.140
LILY: Probably just as long as
I've been wanting to meet you.

41:23.231 --> 41:26.394
Well, now that
the two of you have met,

41:26.484 --> 41:27.974
Mom, I'll give you call...
Oh, no, no, no.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.559
You're not gonna get off
that easy.

41:29.654 --> 41:33.363
Hey, Lily, listen to what
your son just tried to pull off.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.689
LILY: I'm all ears.
