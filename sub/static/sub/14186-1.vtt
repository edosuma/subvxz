is huge, Katie.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.322
How will you
ever get around?

03:10.407 --> 03:12.324
There's a set
of wheels for you.

03:12.409 --> 03:17.162
Probably sixty grand,
plus options.

03:17.248 --> 03:20.249
And all that on top
of the tuition here?

03:20.334 --> 03:23.502
I guess some parents have
money growing on trees.

03:23.587 --> 03:26.338
Well, you're
in the clear dad,

03:26.423 --> 03:28.056
all my loans
were approved

03:28.175 --> 03:30.259
and the college has
a bikeshare program,

03:30.344 --> 03:32.394
so I'm good on the
transportation front.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.562
We should hurry
because I have

03:33.681 --> 03:35.046
to get to the
bookstore by four.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.265
All right, we'll
get you settled.

you'll get there.

the last of it.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.358
Yeah, sure.

Mom, I got it really.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.247
Right.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.702
Well, we should get going
before traffic hits.

03:56.787 --> 03:59.004
Your dad's got a

bye Katie.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.555
Bye, dad.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.257
I should probably
move the truck

04:19.360 --> 04:20.776
before the meter
maid shows up.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.194
I'll meet you
down there.

04:22.279 --> 04:24.563
Okay.

04:32.573 --> 04:36.992
What am I gonna do without
my interior designer?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.277
Who'll help me figure out
where to put the Lazy Boy

04:39.380 --> 04:40.829
when the new
curtains go up?

04:40.914 --> 04:45.467
You know exactly where I
think that eye sore belongs.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.753
It's your Dad's
favorite chair.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.421
It's his favorite thing
in the whole house.

04:49.506 --> 04:50.973
I can't get rid of it.

meet a Sugar Daddy?

05:25.292 --> 05:26.825
It's just like
online dating.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.210
You fill out a form
about yourself,

05:28.295 --> 05:30.796
and say what kind
of guy you want to date.

05:30.881 --> 05:32.381
And membership
is free for girls.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.637
What if he's
really rich?

Fine, 40.

Tessa!?

05:50.284 --> 05:52.150
Older guys like
something more steady

05:52.236 --> 05:54.986
and they're willing to
support your career goals.

05:55.072 --> 05:56.705
Like Leo. He totally
gets my modeling.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.690
Leo is not 65,
he's 40.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.326
He's a
very mature 40.

Take it from me,
I've done this a long time.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.415
You'll meet some
guy in his 30's,

06:06.500 --> 06:08.717
who's already made his
first 10 million,

06:08.836 --> 06:10.752
he'll sweet talk you into
kinky sex on your first date

06:10.838 --> 06:11.720
and then flame out.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.389
You'll never hear
from him again.

school fantasies.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.886
I find that a
tad disturbing.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.388

girls with ambition too.

such a wealthy stud

the city's
new wealth and power.

That's because I wasn't
there with you...

12:31.301 --> 12:33.134
Friends have encouraged
me to date, but...

12:33.220 --> 12:37.055
not easy to do when you've
been married for 40 years.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.807
On top of that
I'm out of town

12:38.892 --> 12:40.758
three weeks out of
every month

12:40.861 --> 12:45.447
and the few women that
I have briefly dated

12:45.565 --> 12:47.315
are not happy with that.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.400
They wanted more
commitment

12:49.486 --> 12:52.403
and that's something
I'm not prepared to give.

12:52.489 --> 12:54.239
Let me be
straight with you.

12:54.324 --> 12:55.990
I'm not in interested
in trying to hook you.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.109

Saul Williams' trophy wife.

Saul Williams.

13:01.498 --> 13:02.797

13:02.916 --> 13:05.449
I'm double majoring in
finance and business.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.919
My goal is to
graduate, get my MBA,

13:08.004 --> 13:10.922
and not end up $250,000
in the hole.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.958
I don't have rich
parents to pay my way.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.978
I was raised by
a single mom.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.597
So what exactly would
I be getting out of this

13:19.683 --> 13:22.100
arrangement between us?

13:22.185 --> 13:24.152

gorgeous on your arm

13:24.271 --> 13:26.804
and knows how to talk
business with your clients.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.806
And when you need feedback
on a new product,

13:28.909 --> 13:30.992
you will always get
my honest opinion.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.361
And the arrangement
will only cost you

13:33.446 --> 13:36.030
three thousand a month.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.615
Wow, you're starting
very low...

13:37.701 --> 13:41.953
I'm well aware I could be
charging a whole lot more.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.538
I don't want
designer purses

13:43.623 --> 13:45.990
or my hair done at
a celebrity salon.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.342
What I want are
my bills paid

13:47.460 --> 13:49.544
and three thousand a
month will cover that.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.179
When you need me,
I'll be there.

you can have that too.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.168

have sex with you.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.137

want sex,

13:59.222 --> 14:02.524

that for $3000 a month,

a striptease?

23:25.705 --> 23:28.706
No, London.
But our clients,

23:28.791 --> 23:31.459
mostly commercial real
estate developers like Leo,

23:31.544 --> 23:33.076
are from all
over the world.

23:33.179 --> 23:36.097
I'm lining up the financing
on two properties...

23:42.388 --> 23:45.523
So you get to travel a lot,
that must be nice.

23:45.608 --> 23:47.892
For me, yes.

23:47.977 --> 23:50.694
For my wife it
wasn't so much fun

23:50.780 --> 23:53.030
which is why
she's now my ex.

23:53.116 --> 23:53.731
What about you?

23:53.816 --> 23:56.317
Oh no, I'm
not married.

23:56.402 --> 23:57.818
I'll let you two
get acquainted,

23:57.904 --> 23:59.737
we'll be right back.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.291
What I meant was, what do
you want to do for work?

24:04.410 --> 24:06.293
[Laughing]

24:06.412 --> 24:08.913
I want to get a job at
an interior design firm,

24:08.998 --> 24:11.215
and then once I have
enough experience,

24:11.300 --> 24:13.717
open up my own shop.

24:13.803 --> 24:15.386
Oh, no, no no.
I'm good.

24:15.471 --> 24:17.922
Come on, it's not
a school night.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.559
Okay.

24:23.312 --> 24:25.062
Do I like him?!

24:25.148 --> 24:27.264
He's ridiculously hot.

24:27.350 --> 24:29.233
He has that sexy
English accent

24:29.318 --> 24:31.936
and he gets what I want
to do with my life.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.521
Of course I like-

24:33.606 --> 24:36.607
[Gasps]
Ow!

24:36.692 --> 24:37.942
<i>You all right</i>
<i> in there?</i>

24:38.027 --> 24:39.527
No, I'm not.

24:39.612 --> 24:42.363
I had like two or three
glasses of champagne.

24:42.448 --> 24:45.699
I told you I'm
a lightweight.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.868
I'm gonna stay over
at Leo's tonight.

24:47.954 --> 24:51.505
Is it okay if James
gives you a ride home?

24:51.624 --> 24:53.007
I think I'll manage.

24:59.849 --> 25:02.683
[Car horn]

25:02.802 --> 25:04.668
They were really
going too fast

25:04.770 --> 25:09.473
or maybe it's all
that champagne?

25:11.811 --> 25:21.735
[Soft piano music]

25:21.821 --> 25:24.538
I should
get you home.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.825
Why? It's not a
school night.

25:27.910 --> 25:30.044
I need to be on a call
to Europe in an hour.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.296
You're such a tease.

25:32.381 --> 25:34.215
Not always.

25:37.837 --> 25:42.723
You know, I always stop in
Seattle on my way to Asia.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.725
And that's a trip I try
to make at least

25:44.844 --> 25:46.393
once or twice a month.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.729
Such a busy boy
from Leeds.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.649
What I'm trying to
say, Katie, is...

25:51.734 --> 25:54.101
I would really love
to see you again.

25:54.186 --> 25:57.321
And I'm saying, I
would love that.

26:08.451 --> 26:12.620
So, Tessa, what
do you think?

26:12.705 --> 26:15.456
Looks great, if you're
going to a funeral.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.125
Which you might be,
given how old Simon is.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.593
Saul.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.346
And this is the only thing
of yours that fits me, Tessa.

26:22.431 --> 26:23.797
It looks conservative!

26:23.883 --> 26:25.432
That's what
you want, right?

26:25.551 --> 26:27.885
He invited me to an angel
investing panel

26:27.970 --> 26:30.271
at the finance conference
that he's hosting.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.223
And he catered a
dinner from Morton's.

26:33.309 --> 26:35.225
All that and a few
dinners this month?

26:35.311 --> 26:37.227
Are you sure he doesn't
expect you to put out?

26:37.313 --> 26:38.862
He likes
my ambition.

26:38.948 --> 26:41.732
The fact that I
have career goals.

26:41.817 --> 26:45.402
I can't believe this!
This model is everywhere!

26:45.488 --> 26:46.737
You're a million
times prettier.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.156
Yeah but, she's like twelve.
She has no wrinkles.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.208
Tessa, you don't
have wrinkles.

26:51.294 --> 26:54.712
Why else would they hire her
again for a skin product?

26:54.797 --> 26:56.547
She just did a huge
Victoria make-up campaign!

26:56.632 --> 27:01.802
You'll land something
else, you always do.

27:01.921 --> 27:06.774
I just need
more exposure.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.109
Hey! Katie.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.494
Hey.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.915
I went by your dorm
the other day

27:15.034 --> 27:16.834
but there was
nobody there.

27:16.919 --> 27:19.236
Look, I'm really sorry about
this weekend, the party.

27:19.338 --> 27:24.258
I feel like... I don't
know how to say it, an ass?

27:24.377 --> 27:27.711
Don't worry
about it, seriously.

27:27.797 --> 27:29.013
Ok, I mean...

27:29.098 --> 27:31.515
truth is I can't really
talk to girls that well

27:31.600 --> 27:34.101
without two
drinks in me.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.103
You're doing
okay now.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.807
You're being really
cool about all this.

27:39.892 --> 27:43.861
Can I maybe, make it up
to you this weekend?

27:43.946 --> 27:46.697
Umm, I have a
friend in town so...

27:46.782 --> 27:47.948
maybe another time?

27:48.067 --> 27:49.233
Yeah, sounds good.

27:49.318 --> 27:51.201
Do you want me to put this
book on your account?

27:51.287 --> 27:53.203
Yeah, that
would be great.

27:53.289 --> 27:55.539
I know I owe
another payment.

27:55.624 --> 27:58.959
Actually, your account
is paid for in full.

27:59.078 --> 28:03.113
Uh, that's impossible.
I owe $400.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.466
No, check it out.
Look! Zero balance.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.721
Says there's an
envelope here for you.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.424
Here.

28:29.492 --> 28:30.240
It's my rich uncle.

28:30.326 --> 28:32.409
Lucky you!

28:32.495 --> 28:34.278
Yeah.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.647
Oh hey, don't
forget your...

28:37.750 --> 28:38.866
Right.

28:43.789 --> 28:46.006
Why did you tell James I owed
money to the bookstore?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.257
I didn't.

28:47.343 --> 28:49.093
Then how did
he find out?

28:49.178 --> 28:53.097
Look, James wanted
to give you a gift.

28:53.182 --> 28:54.932
But something practical,

28:55.017 --> 28:56.517
something you would
really like.

28:56.635 --> 28:59.520
So I told him a lot of students
have accounts at the bookstore.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.855
He doesn't need to
be giving me gifts.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.358
We just met.
It's weird.

29:04.477 --> 29:06.276
Well, he wanted to.
Like I said,

29:06.362 --> 29:09.229
I thought it would do more for
you than a designer handbag.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.532
And it's not
weird, Katie.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.817
It's two people
who like you,

29:13.903 --> 29:16.286
Tessa and this guy
who wanted to do

29:16.372 --> 29:17.654
something nice
for you.

29:17.740 --> 29:20.991
Look Katie, I didn't
mean to offend you.

29:21.076 --> 29:24.161
I was sure he said
something to you about it.

29:24.246 --> 29:26.213
About what?

29:26.332 --> 29:28.081
There's nothing wrong
with getting a little

29:28.167 --> 29:29.750
financial help
when you need it.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.885
And we all need it.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.921
Why would you
need it, Tessa?

29:34.006 --> 29:37.808
Your father is
Charles Bouillette.

29:37.893 --> 29:39.510
He watches me
like a hawk,

29:39.595 --> 29:41.178
every penny I spend,

29:41.263 --> 29:42.896
my bank accounts,
my credit cards.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.648
And I'm trying to launch
a modelling career, okay?

29:44.733 --> 29:48.902
I need new headshots all the
time, clothes, makeup.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.738
Guys like Leo and
James, they get it.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.857
They have the resources and
they don't mind helping out.

29:53.943 --> 29:55.275
They want to help.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.078
It's what
rich guys do.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.530
Ken spoils me.

29:59.615 --> 30:01.748
Especially when
I ignore him.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.169
So they help by
giving gifts?

30:05.254 --> 30:07.254
An allowance is part
of the arrangement.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.506
Isn't that hooking?

30:09.592 --> 30:11.592
What?

30:11.710 --> 30:13.293
Hooking is about sex.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.295
Having an arrangement
with a sugar daddy

30:15.381 --> 30:17.548
is about companionship
with a guy

30:17.633 --> 30:19.766
you'd want to spend
time with anyways.

30:19.885 --> 30:21.351
Sophisticated men who
take you places

30:21.437 --> 30:22.553
and show you things.

30:22.638 --> 30:25.189
And expect sex in return.

30:25.274 --> 30:30.194
Oh, so you wouldn't wanna
have sex with James?

30:30.279 --> 30:32.729
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

30:32.815 --> 30:35.232
Look Katie, James is
important to Leo.

30:35.317 --> 30:37.651
I wouldn't have introduced
him to just anyone.

30:37.736 --> 30:38.735
But you're perfect.

30:38.821 --> 30:41.205
Brains and beauty,
the whole package.

30:41.290 --> 30:43.907
True, she wouldn't.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.162
This is all
really confusing.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.882
Actually, its pretty
straight forward.

30:51.967 --> 30:54.001
You're smart,
you're ambitious.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.469
You're gonna graduate
from college

30:55.588 --> 30:57.221
with a ridiculous
amount of debt.

30:57.306 --> 31:00.173
And what, try and
land an internship?

31:00.259 --> 31:02.426
That doesn't pay?

31:02.511 --> 31:04.177
We're all in the
same boat, Katie.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.263
I don't know, but
I really wish you had

31:06.348 --> 31:08.398
told me all this
before the bar.

31:08.484 --> 31:11.435
Why? So you could
act like this?

31:11.520 --> 31:14.104
All judgemental and
holier than thou?

31:14.189 --> 31:16.189
It's just not me.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.942
Whatever.

31:20.195 --> 31:21.245
Katie!

31:21.330 --> 31:23.080
Hi. Do you have time for
a quick word?

31:23.165 --> 31:25.415
Sure.

31:25.501 --> 31:28.168
Well I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

31:28.287 --> 31:30.153
but you didn't get the
University of Florence

31:30.256 --> 31:31.705
summer fellowship.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.761
Damn.

31:37.846 --> 31:39.046
It was very competitive

31:39.131 --> 31:41.765
and they just had too many
qualified candidates.

31:41.850 --> 31:44.051
Yeah, um...

31:44.136 --> 31:46.603
Well, thank you
for letting me know.

31:46.689 --> 31:49.606
No, no...
hold on, Katie.

31:49.692 --> 31:51.275
From your performance
in class,

31:51.360 --> 31:53.360
it's obvious you
deserve to be there.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.113
So I did something I've never
done for any student before.

31:56.198 --> 31:58.148
I spoke to the
members of the jury

31:58.233 --> 32:01.818
and they've agreed to add
an extra spot for you.

32:01.904 --> 32:03.203
Are you kidding?

32:03.322 --> 32:04.237
No.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.706
That's great!
Thank you so much!

32:05.824 --> 32:06.990
The downside is,

32:07.076 --> 32:09.660
while I got the fellowship
to pay for the course

32:09.745 --> 32:12.212
you have to cover your own
flight and room and board.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.715
But you can get a deal
at a <i> pensione</i>

32:14.833 --> 32:17.134
and inexpensive food
on a meal plan.

32:17.219 --> 32:20.036
Okay, uh, how much
will that run?

32:20.139 --> 32:26.259
Around $7000
for the summer.

32:26.345 --> 32:30.230
I just don't think
that's possible.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.182
I'm already maxed
out on loans.

32:32.267 --> 32:34.601
I literally have $22
in my bank account.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.654
Can you talk
to your parents?

32:37.740 --> 32:39.406
They're pretty much
tapped out now

32:39.525 --> 32:40.657
helping me
however they can.

32:40.743 --> 32:42.025
Look I know it's tough.

32:42.111 --> 32:44.444
But this program is a
feeder into the top

32:44.530 --> 32:46.530
interior design
firms in the country.

32:46.615 --> 32:48.231
Believe me, I know.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.868
I really wanna do it.

32:54.423 --> 32:56.256
I'll hold them off
for a week.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.008
See what you can do
to make it work.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.877
Okay?

33:05.050 --> 33:07.351
Okay, I need
two new outfits

33:07.436 --> 33:08.969
for my new
headshots.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.355
You tell me which
ones you like best,

33:11.440 --> 33:13.523
and I'll let you borrow
whatever you want

33:13.609 --> 33:15.142
for your next
date with Saul.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.778
Better start on my two week
juice fast so they'll fit.

33:20.949 --> 33:22.566
Hold up the
blue one again.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.702
That's it, yeah.

33:38.650 --> 33:42.486
James, asking you
for this money

33:42.571 --> 33:44.287
is really
embarrassing for me.

33:44.373 --> 33:46.123
The $7000 will be
transferred to your account

33:46.208 --> 33:47.541
first thing
in the morning.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.410
I only need half to secure
my place in the program.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.546
The final payment isn't due
until after Thanksgiving.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.131
You'll rest easier
not worrying where

33:54.216 --> 33:57.050
the rest of the money
is gonna come from.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.969
I'll pay you back
as soon as I can.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.387
Stop it, you're not
paying me back.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.556
I'm not looking
for a handout.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.057
I've been working
since I was 15,

34:04.176 --> 34:09.896
helping my dad,
waitressing, babysitting...

34:10.014 --> 34:11.264
I'm sorry, I
really don't mean

34:11.350 --> 34:13.483
to come off as
ungrateful. It's just-

34:13.569 --> 34:16.186
I get it. You pride yourself
on your independence.

34:16.271 --> 34:20.190
That's what I
like about you.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.409
Listen to me, I've
been there before.

34:23.529 --> 34:26.496
