MANY, MANY--

02:25.913 --> 02:28.549
HER FATHER WAS
VERY, VERY RICH

02:28.582 --> 02:31.219
AND VERY, VERY SICK.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.855

02:52.673 --> 02:57.645
HE WHEEZED AND SHOOK
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR,

02:57.678 --> 02:59.847

HOLY GOD!

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:31.520
WELL, SOMEBODY HELP!
HE'LL DROWN!

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:33.522
THE WATER'S
WAY TOO COLD.

01:26:33.556 --> 01:26:35.724
THERE'S RIP TIDES
OUT THERE.

01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:37.493
I'VE SEEN SHARKS.

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:39.762
LOOK THERE!

01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:42.064
THAT'S MONEY!

01:26:42.097 --> 01:26:42.998
AAH!

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.100
GET IN THERE!

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.669
GO! COME ON!

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:49.204
$100 BILLS!

01:26:49.238 --> 01:26:51.340
MY MONEY!

01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:54.543
LET'S GET THE COAST GUARD
AND FISH HIM OUT!

01:26:54.577 --> 01:26:57.212
I WONDER
IF IT'S REAL!

01:26:57.246 --> 01:26:59.548
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

01:26:59.582 --> 01:27:01.917
THAT'S NOT
YOUR MONEY!

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.752
THAT'S MY MONEY!

01:27:03.786 --> 01:27:05.754
STOP THEM!

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:07.290
AAH!

01:27:07.323 --> 01:27:09.825
GET THE MONEY!

01:27:29.778 --> 01:27:31.113
THE BEDROOM KILLER.

01:27:31.146 --> 01:27:32.948
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:37.152
THEY RECOVERED
A FEW THOUSAND.
THE REST WASHED AWAY.

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:40.088
HE SAID
IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG,

01:27:40.122 --> 01:27:42.958
THEY'D KILL BARBARA.

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.927
THINGS COULDN'T HAVE GONE

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.464
MORE WRONG THAN THIS,
COULD THEY?

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:52.368
THAT MEANS SHE'S DEAD.

01:27:57.606 --> 01:28:01.477
AH HA HA HA HA!

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:03.579
AH HA!

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:05.781
AH HA HA HA!

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:19.928
MRS. STONE!

01:28:19.962 --> 01:28:23.499
I'LL BE DAMNED!
MRS. STONE?

01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:24.166
YES?

01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:26.469
WE'RE GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE OK.

01:28:26.502 --> 01:28:29.605
I'M SORRY TO
ASK YOU RIGHT NOW,

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:34.477
BUT WE NEED YOU TO
IDENTIFY THE BODY.

01:28:36.512 --> 01:28:38.447
YES, THAT'S HIM.

01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:40.849
OH, I COULD NEVER
FORGET THAT FACE.

01:28:40.883 --> 01:28:43.285
WHAT HELL
HE PUT ME THROUGH.

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.388
YOU'RE SURE
HE WORKED ALONE?

01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:46.622
OH, POSITIVE.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.190
HE MENTIONED
HAVING A PARTNER.

01:28:48.223 --> 01:28:51.827
HE WAS SCHIZOPHRENIC.
HE THOUGHT HE HAD PARTNERS.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.061
WHERE'S SAM?

01:28:53.095 --> 01:28:54.897
HE'S OVER THERE,
MRS. STONE.

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:57.566
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.370
I'D JUST LIKE TO BE ALONE
WITH MY HUSBAND.

01:29:01.404 --> 01:29:03.439
THANK YOU.

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:06.442
HELLO, SAM.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.380
BARBARA.

01:29:11.414 --> 01:29:13.015
UH...

01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:16.184
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.

01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:18.854
YOU THINK SO?

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:20.656
YEAH, I MEAN...

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:23.426
YOU'RE SO THIN.

01:29:23.459 --> 01:29:24.560
REALLY?

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:27.596
DOES IT SHOW?

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:28.931
YEAH, YEAH...

01:29:28.964 --> 01:29:32.067
I MEAN,
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:35.237
OH, SAM.

01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:37.540
OH, BARBARA.

01:29:38.974 --> 01:29:42.445
HOPE MY MARRIAGE
IS LIKE THEIRS
AFTER 15 YEARS.

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.179
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE DOUBTED

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:46.348
STONE'S AFFECTION
FOR HIS WIFE.

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:48.350
YEAH, WE ALMOST
BLEW IT.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:51.920
YOU WORK
THE LONG HOURS,

01:29:51.954 --> 01:29:53.589
BUT IT ALL
SEEMS WORTH IT

01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:55.190
WHEN YOU GET
MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.292
YEAH, I LOVE
A HAPPY ENDING.

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:59.528
NO! OH! OH!
BARBARA-A-A-A!
