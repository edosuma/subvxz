00:06.839 --> 00:08.470
Previously on E.R.

00:09.094 --> 00:10.586
Happy birthday, son.

00:10.587 --> 00:11.933
I got a card.

00:11.968 --> 00:14.434
And I got two tickets
to the Bulls game.

00:14.435 --> 00:17.219
When you first got here,
we were a little concerned about you.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.936
You seemed to care too much.
What happened to you, Carter?

00:20.137 --> 00:22.432
How do you think money
comes into this place?

00:22.433 --> 00:25.700
It takes results. And that, at any cost,
is what I produce.

00:25.701 --> 00:26.701
Now, you screw with that...

00:26.702 --> 00:30.142
...and you will be off surgical service
for a hell of a lot longer than one day.

00:30.143 --> 00:33.241
I'm stupid enough to ruin my career,
but I don't even have the...

00:33.242 --> 00:37.077
...courage to do it the right way.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.821

01:03.555 --> 01:07.267
Mobilize with Kocher maneuver.
Divide at pylorus.

01:07.434 --> 01:11.564
Transect stomach TA 90.
ID ligament of Trietz.

01:11.731 --> 01:13.399
Come on.

02:31.942 --> 02:35.070
- My Billroth ll has been canceled.
- Good morning to you too.

02:35.237 --> 02:38.574
- Is there a problem?
- Your patient developed a fever.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.202
No, a problem with me
in this department.

02:41.368 --> 02:44.206
Ever since I left Vucelich's study,
I've been underutilized.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.042
When you were working with him,
he monopolized your time.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.962
You're back with the teeming masses,
and there's lag time...

02:50.129 --> 02:54.258
...while the schedule plays catch-up
to your change of fortune.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.594
I see.

03:20.369 --> 03:22.121
- What have we got?
-30-year-old male...

03:22.288 --> 03:23.749
...had a bad Valentine's Day.

03:23.916 --> 03:26.960
Threw himself on the El tracks
in front of a oncoming train.

03:27.127 --> 03:29.504
Did a good job on himself.
How are his vitals?

03:29.671 --> 03:31.965
Sinus tach at 150. BP's 50 palp.

03:32.132 --> 03:35.802
Bilateral hemothorax,
rigid belly, head trauma.

03:35.969 --> 03:41.559
Near amputation, right forearm.
Deformed fracture, left femur.

03:41.726 --> 03:46.814
- Open fracture, lower right extremity.
- Put in chest tube. I'll do the DPL.

03:46.981 --> 03:49.734
It's a deal. 36 French.

03:49.901 --> 03:52.362
We need four units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser.

03:52.529 --> 03:55.824
Pupils are unequal and sluggish.
We need a head CT to rule out a bleed.

03:55.991 --> 03:58.327
No time. Positive tap.
Do those burr holes blind.

03:58.493 --> 04:01.122
No way, I need a CT first.

04:01.664 --> 04:03.959
Let's shock him.

04:04.126 --> 04:06.337
- I wish I'd thought of that.
- Two hundred!

04:07.171 --> 04:09.173
- Clear!
- Clear.

04:10.799 --> 04:13.802
- All right. We've got a rhythm.
- Sinus tach at 160.

04:13.969 --> 04:18.683
Lidocaine 100 IV push.
Dopamine 400 and 500. Start it at 10!

04:18.850 --> 04:21.519
- We've got a pulse.
- I'll take him.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.522
You do the burr holes up in the O.R.
If not, he's toast.

04:24.689 --> 04:29.110
- He's not stable.
- He's as stable as he's gonna get. Move.

04:30.361 --> 04:34.033
We have some other sick people
if you want them too.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.203
- Wow! What did he have for breakfast?
- Something hard to digest.

05:42.231 --> 05:47.570
Did you forget? I'm not on until 11.
We can sleep in.

05:47.737 --> 05:52.492
Yeah. You're soaked.
Yeah, okay.

05:52.659 --> 05:54.828
Oh, boy. Yeah.

05:57.956 --> 05:59.750
- Yes?
- Good morning, Ms. Lewis.

05:59.916 --> 06:03.003
It's Ms. Pearline with social services.

06:03.170 --> 06:04.641
- Who?
- Ms. Pearline.

06:04.994 --> 06:07.463
I'm here for your home visit.
For the adoption.

06:07.798 --> 06:09.310
What?

06:09.510 --> 06:12.597
I worked really late last night.

06:12.764 --> 06:16.017
You could reschedule, but it will take
another four to six weeks.

06:16.184 --> 06:21.274
No, no. Come on up.
Just come up slowly, please.

06:21.441 --> 06:24.027
- Morning.
- Actually, good night.

06:24.194 --> 06:25.862
- Hey, Dr. Ross.
- Hey.

06:26.029 --> 06:28.781
Still got that extra ticket
to the Bulls game next week?

06:28.948 --> 06:33.037
I do have two tickets,
but they're not extra.

06:33.203 --> 06:35.331
The ones your dad gave you?

06:35.497 --> 06:37.624
- I thought you threw those out?
- I was...

06:37.791 --> 06:39.835
...but they' re mid-court,
about 10 rows up.

06:40.002 --> 06:42.337
You guys heard about
all the excitement yesterday?

06:42.504 --> 06:44.382
- What excitement?
- Scottie Pippen came in.

06:44.549 --> 06:47.218
- Here?
- He was not.

06:47.385 --> 06:51.723
Actually, he did. Brought in a kid from
his Cabrini Greens tutoring program.

06:51.890 --> 06:55.226
Had a basketball clinic. Kid took
a charge, broke his collarbone.

06:55.393 --> 06:58.898
Nice try, Jerry.
A lot of details, almost believable.

06:59.064 --> 07:00.816
It's the truth. Look.

07:00.983 --> 07:03.527
I got his autograph.
You know what that's worth?

07:03.694 --> 07:07.239
- It's I-N, not E-N.
- No, it's E-N. It was him.

07:07.406 --> 07:11.494
- Who else was on?
- Kid's mom showed up, so Scottie split.

07:11.661 --> 07:15.040
- So nobody else saw him?
- I'm heading upstairs.

07:15.206 --> 07:18.501
- Can we watch?
- My God, haven't you had that baby yet?

07:18.668 --> 07:21.463
You won't have me to make fun of
after today.

07:21.629 --> 07:24.884
- I thought you'd work up to your due date.
- I have, and then some.

07:25.050 --> 07:27.261
Doc's gonna induce
if nothing happens by Monday.

07:27.428 --> 07:30.307
I'm going up to OB for a non-stress test.

07:30.474 --> 07:32.267
I feel like a damn elephant.

07:32.434 --> 07:36.021
- Elephant's gestation period is two years.
- Oh, shut your mouth.

07:36.188 --> 07:38.065
My interview is not until 4:00.

07:38.274 --> 07:42.445
Benton'll be done by 10:30. I'll find
him. I won't beg, I'll be dignified.

07:42.612 --> 07:46.616
I won't have a fair shot at this internship
unless he rewrites my recommendation.

07:46.782 --> 07:49.118
Ninety applicants for six slots.

07:49.285 --> 07:51.246
- How did you see it?
- It was on his desk.

07:51.413 --> 07:54.708
"Has put forth a consistent effort. "
That's what he says about me.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.461
"Has acquired solid technical skills. "
I told you that.

07:57.627 --> 07:59.838
- Several times.
- We've had our differences.

08:00.005 --> 08:04.719
But I've worked my butt off for him.
Where the hell's our train?

08:04.886 --> 08:08.890
How soon after intercourse can you get
a pregnancy result by blood test?

08:09.056 --> 08:12.560
Seven days. The other applicants are
from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Hopkins.

08:12.727 --> 08:16.105
I've got the home-court advantage,
but still...

08:16.272 --> 08:20.027
Wait a second, did you say pregnancy?
You think you're pregnant?

08:20.193 --> 08:22.112
- We've been really careful.
- I know.

08:22.279 --> 08:25.824
- Did you miss your period?
- No, not yet. I'm just obsessing.

08:25.991 --> 08:28.493
- You don't need this.
- The interview is nerve-racking.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.495
Sorry. Want to draw some blood?

08:30.663 --> 08:35.333
It can wait. I'm just being paranoid.
You worry about your interview.

08:39.589 --> 08:43.802
- Hey, we need some help!
- What happened?

08:43.970 --> 08:46.890
- Hey, we need some help here.
- Don't tell me your water broke.

08:47.056 --> 08:49.142
Sprinkler system went berserk.

08:49.309 --> 08:52.562
It's raining cats and dogs,
and we can't shut it off!

08:52.729 --> 08:53.980
Need a hand here, quick!

08:54.147 --> 08:55.356
- Jerry!
- Yes.

08:55.523 --> 08:57.526
The whole west wing is getting soaked!

08:57.693 --> 09:00.946
- Labor and Delivery and the Nursery?
- NICU and Postpartum.

09:01.113 --> 09:04.116
All high-risk women
are going to the sixth.

09:04.283 --> 09:05.868
Everyone else is down here.

09:06.035 --> 09:08.120
- How many?
- Eight, all in active labor.

09:08.287 --> 09:10.622
Oh, boy. All right. Chuny!

09:10.790 --> 09:14.043
We need some dry gowns,
some warming lamps.

09:14.210 --> 09:16.629
You gotta change.
Blow dryers if you can find any.

09:16.796 --> 09:18.965
- This is a new one.
- This really sucks!

09:19.132 --> 09:21.092
Dr. Ross, this one's pretty ripe.

09:21.259 --> 09:23.636
Is there any time
between your contractions?

09:23.803 --> 09:25.389
- No, none.
- All right.

09:25.556 --> 09:29.727
Let's get a pelvic bed set up in Trauma 1.
Somebody call Mark.

09:32.646 --> 09:33.897
Coming through!

09:34.481 --> 09:39.112
- ICP's 14.
- Final ligature. Spleen's out. Suction!

09:40.739 --> 09:44.075
So if you're looking to kill yourself,
the El tracks'll do the job.

09:44.242 --> 09:46.870
- We're dry.
- BP's 100...

09:47.037 --> 09:48.580
Send it to Pathology.

09:48.747 --> 09:51.918
- What do you wanna tackle next?
- Run a small bowel for perforations.

09:52.085 --> 09:55.046
- How does the arm look?
- As bad as the rest of him.

09:55.213 --> 09:58.675
- Think you can save this guy?
- We're chasing our tails here.

09:58.842 --> 10:01.845
Damn, he's hemorrhaging!

10:02.012 --> 10:04.682
- It looks arterial.
- Let's open him up!

10:04.849 --> 10:07.268
It's your party, but this is
a teaching exercise now.

10:07.435 --> 10:10.479
- What do you mean, teaching exercise?
- There's not a life to save.

10:10.646 --> 10:13.441
You wanna bet? Sternal saw!

10:16.360 --> 10:19.489
Run up to Delivery. Take galoshes
and an umbrella if you have to.

10:19.656 --> 10:24.119
But find me an extra stash of preemie and
term-sized ambu-bags and infant ET tubes.

10:24.286 --> 10:26.371
- Get some bulb syringes.
- You got it!

10:26.538 --> 10:29.291
Your baby's head
is engaged in the canal.

10:29.458 --> 10:33.504
The membrane isn't ruptured yet,
so we'll do an amniotomy to rupture it.

10:33.671 --> 10:36.674
- What's the presentation?
- Station two plus, effaced and dilated.

10:36.841 --> 10:38.718
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

10:38.885 --> 10:41.971
He went to buy film.
He won't even know where I am!

10:42.138 --> 10:43.639
We'll find him. Just relax.

10:43.806 --> 10:46.310
- Taking an incubator!
- Blankets.

10:46.476 --> 10:49.813
You were on yesterday.
Tell Dr. Ross Scottie Pippen was in here.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.316
Yeah, and so were
Jordan and Rodman.

10:52.482 --> 10:55.027
Jerry, Conni and I
beat them three-on-three.

10:55.193 --> 10:57.905
It's a monsoon up there.
All fetal monitors are trashed.

10:58.072 --> 11:00.450
- How many do you have?
- A few. We'll rotate them.

11:00.617 --> 11:04.288
High risks went up to six, where I
have to be. Send some residents.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.039
- We'll handle it.
- Who's attending?

11:06.206 --> 11:08.208
Good. Push, push. That's it!

11:08.375 --> 11:11.713
- You know Mark Greene?
- Oh, yes. Membrane ruptured?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.173
We had to do it for her.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.883
- Was the head engaged?
- Yes.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.635
All right. Don't want a cord prolapse.

11:17.802 --> 11:21.723
Okay, when you get the urge,
I want you to push.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.683
Okay? Okay.

11:23.850 --> 11:28.731
Good. Seeing a head here.
Here it comes. Take a deep breath.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.941
Push!

11:46.541 --> 11:51.297
- Patient in Exam 2 is ready.
- I'm on my way.

11:51.463 --> 11:54.925
Mrs. Wilson, you have
a beautiful baby boy.

11:55.092 --> 11:58.345
Fundus is firm. Placenta's coming.

11:58.512 --> 12:03.058
Activity, two.
Pulse, two. Grimace, two.

12:03.225 --> 12:06.896
One laceration.
Dr. Greene, will you suture?

12:07.063 --> 12:09.566
I think I can handle that.

12:09.733 --> 12:12.194
Apgar is nine. Check again in five.

12:12.361 --> 12:15.614
Use 2-0 chromic, interrupted suture
for the muscularis layer...

12:15.781 --> 12:18.827
- ... interlocking for the mucosa.
- We can manage from here, Janet.

12:18.994 --> 12:21.830
- You got other fish to fry.
- Just don't take any chances.

12:21.997 --> 12:26.418
You run into trouble, run them to us.
Six East for all C-sections, understood?

12:27.919 --> 12:30.422
- We'll need another bassinet.
- They'll send them down.

12:30.589 --> 12:32.091
No, we need another one now.

12:32.258 --> 12:34.802
- She's having contractions again.
- What?

12:34.969 --> 12:38.139
- Why?
- I hope you're ready for an encore.

12:38.306 --> 12:40.474
- You're having another.
- I don't believe it!

12:40.641 --> 12:42.268
Came in before the sprinklers went.

12:42.435 --> 12:45.439
- Nobody monitored her.
- I had an ultrasound months ago.

12:45.605 --> 12:48.608
I've got ahold of the head.
No, make that the tush.

12:49.109 --> 12:53.447
- This is a breech? I'll deliver.
- No, I'm okay. I've got a good hold here.

12:53.613 --> 12:57.618
- What's wrong?
- Your second baby wants to be different.

12:57.785 --> 13:01.164
So he's gonna come out butt-first.
Now, just push.

13:01.330 --> 13:03.457
Keep the feet out!

13:03.624 --> 13:08.170
Good, Christy.
Good, good. Push. Good!

13:08.337 --> 13:11.633
That's good. That's really good.
Keep going! Push!

13:15.178 --> 13:17.139
Good. Okay.

13:23.730 --> 13:27.609
Those are the shoulders.
Relax, because I gotta get the head.

13:27.776 --> 13:31.113
- Flex the head!
- Push gently.

13:33.740 --> 13:35.075
Good.

13:36.493 --> 13:39.330
Good! Excellent! Nice, nice!

13:41.875 --> 13:45.128
Nice work, Mom! There.

13:48.172 --> 13:51.010
Oh, my God! Two of them!

13:51.176 --> 13:55.306
Smooth, Mark. You'd think
you delivered a breech every day.

13:55.472 --> 13:59.059
- Page me if you need me.
- Okay.

14:00.936 --> 14:03.313
Suction. Mom, relax.

14:13.950 --> 14:16.286
The place was a pigsty.

14:16.703 --> 14:19.290
Susie had a bruise
from pulling the highchair over.

14:19.456 --> 14:21.500
The more I explained,
the phonier it sounded.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.712
I'm sure you're the best adoption
candidate they've had all month.

14:24.879 --> 14:29.383
They're sending this guy over this week
for work-site interviews. Please lie.

14:29.550 --> 14:32.555
- Can you take this girl in 3?
- We prefer to be called "women. "

14:32.722 --> 14:34.098
Judge for yourself.

14:34.265 --> 14:37.893
With my last two, I had Pitocin
and epidural with no complications.

14:38.060 --> 14:39.395
I'd love to pit you-

14:39.562 --> 14:43.482
With the monitor shortage, we don't
know if the baby's having distress.

14:43.649 --> 14:47.470
I'm in distress. If I wanted
a natural birth, I'd have stayed home.

14:49.072 --> 14:51.575
What's next? Natural dentistry?

14:52.284 --> 14:54.202
Okay, Ms. Amayo.

14:56.371 --> 14:59.292
Tina. How are you doing?

14:59.458 --> 15:01.210
It hurts.

15:01.961 --> 15:06.465
I'll put these on you for a reading.
Did they tell you about the monitors?

15:06.632 --> 15:09.760
I don't know.
There was a lot of stuff.

15:09.927 --> 15:13.265
- Oh, good, a doctor's here.
- Sorry, Tina, they didn't have X-Men.

15:13.432 --> 15:16.435
I'm Dr. Lewis.
I was just explaining the monitors.

15:16.601 --> 15:18.687
It's been a crazy day for her.

15:18.854 --> 15:21.606
- Your daughter's 13?
- She's not our daughter.

15:21.773 --> 15:25.403
We've only known Tina for a few
months. We're adopting her baby.

15:26.195 --> 15:28.406
She called us
when the contractions began.

15:28.656 --> 15:31.200
Her mother was out.

15:31.367 --> 15:36.497
- Did you find my momma?
- She's still not home. We'll try again.

15:36.664 --> 15:39.585
- Who examines that?
- Your urine specimen?

15:39.751 --> 15:41.253
We send it to the lab.

15:41.420 --> 15:44.382
- You'll tell them about my abduction?
- Well-

15:44.549 --> 15:48.094
Not that I expect them to have tests
to identify alien life.

15:48.261 --> 15:49.637
No, probably not.

15:49.804 --> 15:55.394
If they find anything unusual, maybe
the FBl or NASA will listen to them.

15:55.561 --> 16:00.941
They don't take phone calls from victims
of extraterrestrial insemination.

16:01.108 --> 16:04.571
- You're pregnant by aliens?
- It was so humiliating.

16:04.904 --> 16:06.114
I bet.

16:08.408 --> 16:13.580
Here's one more to go,
and this goes with it.

16:14.664 --> 16:17.375
For a pregnancy test.

16:18.252 --> 16:20.713
- Ready for another look?
- Could we do two laps?

16:20.879 --> 16:25.092
- I want to be at least four centimeters.
- She's very goal-oriented.

16:25.259 --> 16:27.928
Walk on.

16:29.138 --> 16:32.225
I hate men like that.
It gives you false hope.

16:32.392 --> 16:36.688
It's safer to believe
that guys like that don't exist.

16:39.274 --> 16:42.777
Finally, fresh recruits.
I thought this shift would never end.

16:42.944 --> 16:44.780
- What's the EBL?
- Five liters.

16:44.947 --> 16:47.032
Carter, wanna scrub in?

16:47.199 --> 16:50.786
I would, but I have to give a tour
of the hospital to the candidates.

16:50.953 --> 16:52.747
Stiff competition.

16:52.914 --> 16:57.502
Had a couple of hours to kill before
my interview at 4, so I came by.

16:57.669 --> 17:00.923
I was hoping you managed to get
a final draft of my letter of rec out.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.591
One draft, sent it last week.

17:02.758 --> 17:05.301
Great, great. Great.

17:05.469 --> 17:08.973
Great. Thanks.
Nice work.

17:10.766 --> 17:13.603
Peter, word's gotten around this is
where the resurrection is.

17:13.770 --> 17:16.314
I have some students
who wanna see you raise the dead.

17:16.481 --> 17:18.108
They'll have a good view there.

17:18.275 --> 17:22.820
They'll benefit from learning how and why
you decided to pursue this hopeless case.

17:24.030 --> 17:26.450
How and why?

17:26.617 --> 17:30.705
I saw the guy. I knew I could fix him.
I went to work.

17:31.539 --> 17:33.332
Pressure's 110/75.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.838
- Good call. She's abrupted.
- Anytime.

17:38.005 --> 17:41.925
- Yeah, whatever.
- He said he was gonna send some tickets.

17:42.092 --> 17:44.344
Are you still telling
that Scottie Pippen story?

17:44.511 --> 17:45.971
It's not a story.

17:46.138 --> 17:47.848
Here she comes. Conni!

17:49.307 --> 17:52.687
- Beet soup?
- That's what they say. Crazy.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.481
It's put a lot of women in labor.
It was in the papers.

17:55.648 --> 17:59.986
- What has?
- The beet soup at Doc Magoo's.

18:00.152 --> 18:02.030
- Induces labor.
- Come on.

18:02.197 --> 18:04.408
- I read that.
- It's not that far-fetched.

18:04.576 --> 18:07.996
A lot of plants
have ergot alkaloid derivatives.

18:08.162 --> 18:13.376
- What do those do?
- Make the uterus contract.

18:13.543 --> 18:15.712
- Susan?
- Yeah?

18:15.878 --> 18:19.299
I've been monitoring Leah Russell.
A few things don't add up.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.593
She hasn't been able to give us
a urine sample.

18:21.760 --> 18:25.305
Her chart shows she's had two
previous births, but she lives alone.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.767
- She's nervous, underweight...
- You're thinking drugs?

18:28.934 --> 18:32.105
I checked with the hospitals.
As a teen she had two crack babies.

18:32.272 --> 18:35.316
One she lost at six months.
One was taken away at birth.

18:35.483 --> 18:38.152
Lead the way.

18:41.072 --> 18:43.283
Here we go again. Hi, Dad.

18:44.577 --> 18:49.039
- I hate this part!
- Try to save your breath.

18:49.206 --> 18:53.419
If you don't get a vasectomy,
I swear you're having the next one!

18:53.585 --> 18:55.504
How big is this kid?

18:55.671 --> 19:00.760
Ease up on the pushing, okay?
There's the head.

19:01.928 --> 19:05.557
- Would you please shut up?
- She has to go through this herself soon.

19:05.723 --> 19:08.101
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

19:08.268 --> 19:11.856
- That's it!
- Look at that one. She's a 10-pounder!

19:12.022 --> 19:15.110
I take it back.
You scream all you want!

19:15.277 --> 19:18.989
- Suction.
- The baby's lethargic. Apgar, three.

19:20.198 --> 19:24.662
Hold it! No, no.
All right, let's bag her.

19:25.162 --> 19:26.414
Is something wrong?

19:26.580 --> 19:29.458
Did you test positive for diabetes
during your prenatal care?

19:29.625 --> 19:31.752
What's wrong?

19:31.919 --> 19:33.754
Start CPR. I'm gonna intubate.

19:34.547 --> 19:37.633
Prep an umbilical line
and heel-stick a glucose.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.805
- Please?
- What is it? This didn't happen before.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.684
You may have developed gestational
diabetes during your pregnancy.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.499
Bolus, two cc's per kilo.
Is she breathing?

19:48.534 --> 19:49.855
Weak respiratory effort.

19:50.021 --> 19:53.150
Give her a 10 cc infusion of D10.
Stick her for another glucose.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.279
- Why isn't she crying?
- Your baby's been intubated.

19:56.445 --> 20:00.491
Try and lie back.
Lie back and relax.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.871
Jeanie said that you can't
give us a urine sample.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.331
Yeah, I tried.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.751
I suggest you try again
because if you can't produce a sample...

20:09.918 --> 20:12.129
...we'll have to put a catheter in
to get one.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.589
- Why do you need it?
- So we can do a tox screen.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.049
You do them on white women?

20:16.216 --> 20:19.429
We do them on everyone who has
a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

20:19.595 --> 20:23.058
I suggest you cooperate.
Let me know the results.

20:23.225 --> 20:25.018
- You looked me up.
- Shall we?

20:25.686 --> 20:28.856
- You had to tell her?
- She's the doctor.

20:29.022 --> 20:31.484
I was just tripping
because I was busted before.

20:31.651 --> 20:35.822
- I was a kid then, but now I'm clean.
- Let's find out.

20:38.324 --> 20:42.036
- Pulse ox, 98.
- That's what I want to hear.

20:42.203 --> 20:45.332
Come here, you. Look at that.

20:46.125 --> 20:48.877
Dr. Greene, thank you. Thank you!

20:49.044 --> 20:52.798
- Wait, I didn't get it! Do that again.
- Thank you!

20:52.965 --> 20:54.383
- Dr. Ross?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:54.550 --> 20:57.636
- Get over here! Come on!
- No, no, no.

20:57.803 --> 21:02.809
This is the doctor
that saved our little Renee!

21:03.476 --> 21:04.978
- I love you.
- All right.

21:05.144 --> 21:09.190
Me too, doc. I love you!

21:09.357 --> 21:11.276
You know what? I love this doctor too!

21:12.236 --> 21:13.988
I want a copy of that one.

21:14.154 --> 21:18.117
I'm taking Renee up to ICU to have them
check her. Congratulations.

21:18.283 --> 21:21.412
Yeah, get it on tape.

21:28.628 --> 21:31.631
Pleased to meet you. John Carter.
Pleased to meet you.

21:31.798 --> 21:34.885
- Ken Matsumitsu. You're from?
- I'm the local guy.

21:35.052 --> 21:36.971
- You're...?
- From Boston.

21:37.138 --> 21:39.432
Ken's the Howard Hughes Fellow
at Harvard.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.268
Congratulations.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.895
- John Carter.
- Andrea Zucker, Stanford.

21:44.062 --> 21:46.231
California. Explains the tan.

21:46.398 --> 21:48.942
No, I just did 10 months
in a clinic in Senegal.

21:49.109 --> 21:50.860
- Oh.
- This is Martin Fisher.

21:51.027 --> 21:53.739
- How are you?
- Martin Fisher?

21:53.906 --> 21:56.575
- Published in Nature last month.
- That's me.

21:56.742 --> 21:59.286
Okay, guys. We can all go home.

21:59.453 --> 22:03.916
Did you read it?
He cloned tyrosine kinase receptors.

22:04.083 --> 22:08.255
Wow. Well, shall we, with the tour?

22:13.510 --> 22:15.804
Her back is killing her. What can I do?

22:15.971 --> 22:18.266
Roll on your side.
When the contractions start...

22:18.432 --> 22:20.351
...press down on her back
to give relief.

22:20.518 --> 22:21.769
- Like this?
- Yeah. Good.

22:30.069 --> 22:33.865
- Is she doing okay?
- Yeah, thanks to the two of you.

22:34.032 --> 22:35.951
I hope she's not
depending on us too much.

22:36.118 --> 22:39.121
- What do you mean?
- She needs a mother herself.

22:39.287 --> 22:43.167
We can only adopt a baby.
We can't take her too.

22:45.129 --> 22:49.299
- Give me the bullet.
- I'm Dr. Castiglioni, Internal Medicine.

22:49.466 --> 22:52.719
I'm in my 34th week. I have
a scheduled induction for Monday.

22:52.886 --> 22:55.639
My membrane ruptured 40 minutes ago.
I'm fully dilated.

22:55.806 --> 22:58.226
I'll take the express elevator
to Labor and Delivery.

22:58.393 --> 23:01.479
I'm sorry, but L and D
has maintenance problems.

23:01.646 --> 23:04.774
We're taking all admits in here today.

23:04.941 --> 23:08.945
- You have your hands full.
- Yeah, but we can handle one more.

23:09.112 --> 23:13.075
On my count. One, two, three.

23:17.371 --> 23:19.665
Sorry, I think you left this behind.

23:19.832 --> 23:23.877
Stage three carcinoma of the breast.
I had a mastectomy six years ago.

23:24.461 --> 23:26.631
Cancer flared up again last spring.

23:26.798 --> 23:30.385
I was started on a CMF chemo
regimen and slated for radiation...

23:30.552 --> 23:32.387
...when I found out I was pregnant.

23:32.554 --> 23:35.390
- Any implications for the fetus?
- Ultrasounds looked fine.

23:35.557 --> 23:38.936
But methotrexate is contraindicated
in the first trimester.

23:39.103 --> 23:42.731
- I won't rest easy till I see this baby.
- It shouldn't be long.

23:42.898 --> 23:45.317
The angels were watching over her.

23:45.484 --> 23:48.779
If I'd had the radiation,
she would have gotten a toxic dose.

23:48.946 --> 23:52.909
- You suspended your treatment?
- For the first trimester.

23:53.076 --> 23:55.621
I've been on
a modified regimen since then.

23:56.705 --> 24:00.292
It wasn't a hard choice.
I've got a matter of months left.

24:00.459 --> 24:02.336
My baby has her whole life ahead.

24:02.503 --> 24:05.382
You were right, doctor.
You are fully dilated.

24:05.549 --> 24:07.843
Call Coburn, tell her
we've got one coming up.

24:08.009 --> 24:10.887
Dr. Coburn? No, please.

24:11.054 --> 24:14.432
I've worked too hard for this delivery
to have Coburn anywhere near it.

24:14.599 --> 24:17.394
You're old friends, huh?

24:17.560 --> 24:22.066
- Still, all the high-risks have to go up.
- I'm not considered high-risk.

24:22.233 --> 24:26.237
Dr. Lopez was going to induce me
in the birthing center.

24:26.404 --> 24:27.905
Is Ferdie there?

24:28.072 --> 24:30.741
I hope you're calling your husband.
The baby is on her way.

24:30.908 --> 24:32.994
My husband's already driving in.

24:33.161 --> 24:37.833
Fernando,
you'll never guess where I am.

24:37.999 --> 24:41.086
Let me hand you over to Dr. Mark Greene.

24:41.253 --> 24:46.133
It's my OB. Break it to him gently.
He's gonna be jealous.

24:48.886 --> 24:51.806
Look at this, standing room only.

24:53.891 --> 24:56.394
So you got Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

24:56.560 --> 24:58.230
Getting there.

24:58.397 --> 25:02.150
Marathon surgery.
You run the 20K too?

25:02.317 --> 25:05.154
Not since med school.
How does it look?

25:05.321 --> 25:07.532
Massive crush injury.
We should amputate.

25:07.698 --> 25:09.617
He'll live.
Might as well keep his arm.

25:09.784 --> 25:14.748
- It's longer than a long shot.
- It won't hurt to try.

25:14.915 --> 25:18.544
She'll thank you. Patient's mom,
she works over in Recovery.

25:18.710 --> 25:21.046
Said to tell you, "God bless. "

25:23.799 --> 25:27.595
Okay, spectators, no intermission.
We're going straight into the next act.

25:27.762 --> 25:29.681
Pulse ox, 97.

25:30.473 --> 25:33.101
I owe you an apology.
Your tox screen came back negative.

25:33.268 --> 25:34.686
I told you I kicked it.

25:35.353 --> 25:37.438
People don't think you can, but I did.

25:37.605 --> 25:41.068
- You must be a strong lady.
- Not enough to take much more of this.

25:41.235 --> 25:45.531
- There she is!
- Don't look at me. I'm a wreck!

25:45.697 --> 25:49.993
- This baby's giving you a real workout.
- That's for sure.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.704
I bought you some candy.

25:52.705 --> 25:54.958
We're pretty crowded.
We have to limit visitors.

25:55.124 --> 25:58.586
- But I'm her sister!
- Birthing coach and sister.

25:59.254 --> 26:01.464
Okay, just don't stay too long.

26:01.631 --> 26:04.050
Let me look at you.

26:04.217 --> 26:06.470
- Jeanie, have you seen Harper?
- Not recently.

26:06.637 --> 26:09.390
She sent a blood test
for the woman in Exam 2.

26:09.556 --> 26:12.977
- The alien abduction.
- Yeah, this is so odd.

26:14.104 --> 26:16.439
- I want my mama!
- We're with you, Tina.

26:16.606 --> 26:18.776
- Blow! Blow! Go on!
- It hurts!

26:18.943 --> 26:22.238
That's because your baby's coming.

26:22.405 --> 26:25.616
- Whoa, next door!
- Got it!

26:25.783 --> 26:30.371
Doing great, doctor. You're doing great.
Meconium in the fluid.

26:30.538 --> 26:33.708
Amnioinfuse 500 cc's normal saline.

26:33.875 --> 26:37.003
You push. I'll run the procedure.

26:37.170 --> 26:39.923
Do exactly what she said.

26:40.090 --> 26:42.550
Since then, I've had
the most awful nosebleeds.

26:42.717 --> 26:44.636
- Harper, there you are.
- Dr. Weaver.

26:44.803 --> 26:49.058
What possessed you to run a pregnancy
test on this visibly gestational woman?

26:49.225 --> 26:52.770
I had a lapse.
I don't know what I was thinking.

26:52.937 --> 26:55.773
Until the hypnosis,
I thought I was absent-minded.

26:55.940 --> 26:57.441
Maybe they gotten to you too.

26:57.608 --> 27:02.239
Maybe they beamed up the entire lab.
Her pregnancy test came back negative.

27:02.405 --> 27:03.990
Oh, yes!

27:04.157 --> 27:06.618
I told you
this was no ordinary conception.

27:06.785 --> 27:10.747
And it's not.
It's pseudocyesis, and a classic case of it.

27:10.914 --> 27:14.752
Ms. Clarke's pelvic exam confirms
the lab's. She's not pregnant.

27:15.545 --> 27:16.754
But look at her.

27:16.921 --> 27:20.883
Distended abdomen from hyperventilation
due to contractions.

27:21.050 --> 27:24.137
- She's got a colon full of gas.
- That's what they always say.

27:24.304 --> 27:28.030
Those creatures blew their
interstellar filth into my cavities,

27:28.065 --> 27:30.119
and it's hibernating there.

27:31.521 --> 27:32.772
Good choice.

27:32.939 --> 27:36.109
The father-in-waiting thing has
changed since the Ricky Ricardo days.

27:36.275 --> 27:37.860
Nice to preserve traditions.

27:38.027 --> 27:40.447
- Excuse me.
- Just a sec. I know how you feel-

27:40.614 --> 27:42.199
- Excuse me.
- Can't you see we're-?

27:42.366 --> 27:44.785
Jerry, right?

27:45.494 --> 27:48.705
- I just want to thank you again.
- You're welcome.

27:50.582 --> 27:55.505
Can you stay here for just one minute?
One minute, one minute.

28:01.469 --> 28:06.308
- How's the fetal heart rate?
-140. Good variability.

28:07.518 --> 28:10.646
- I'm not progressing.
- You can do it.

28:10.813 --> 28:12.314
- Dr. Ross!
- I'm busy in here.

28:12.481 --> 28:15.067
- He's here, Scottie Pippen.
- Jerry.

28:15.234 --> 28:16.819
Okay, okay, I'll bring him here.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.491
Where'd he go?

28:21.658 --> 28:23.576
- Who?
- Scottie Pippen.

28:23.743 --> 28:26.663
- Is he kind of a tall guy?
- Yeah, you could say that.

28:26.829 --> 28:32.253
- Said to tell everyone, "Thanks. "
- Like they're gonna believe that!

28:34.256 --> 28:37.008
- I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

28:37.175 --> 28:40.261
You are. Hold your breath,
use it to push the baby out.

28:40.428 --> 28:44.849
- I'm gonna die.
- No, you're not. You're doing beautifully.

28:45.016 --> 28:47.520
Okay, Tina.
One more time, and then you're there.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.356
- You said that before.
- You are doing such a hard thing.

28:50.523 --> 28:53.984
You're doing a great job. Some grown
women can't hang in there like that.

28:54.151 --> 28:58.949
- Really?
- Really. I'm so proud. Bear down!

28:59.699 --> 29:02.035
Bear down! Come on, bear down!

29:02.202 --> 29:04.955
Shouldn't be long now.
Did your friend leave?

29:05.121 --> 29:09.209
- Yeah. Can I go to the bathroom?
- Sure.

29:12.338 --> 29:15.257
- Let me help you.
- I can do it.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.761
What's wrong?

29:58.262 --> 29:59.931
Get this damn stuff away from me.

30:03.434 --> 30:04.936
Your friend bring this?

30:06.605 --> 30:10.943
Am I ever gonna kick this stuff?
I've been clean for two months.

30:11.109 --> 30:13.153
But you did use crack
during your pregnancy?

30:13.320 --> 30:17.366
Yeah. I mean,
not too much after the beginning.

30:18.618 --> 30:21.496
I have to let the doctors know.

30:26.918 --> 30:30.046
- Help my partner! He was electrocuted!
- Grab that gurney!

30:30.213 --> 30:33.384
Come on! Lie him here!

30:36.136 --> 30:39.973
- Soaking wet. What happened?
- We were working in standing water.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.309
A 220 line fell. It must've been hot.

30:42.476 --> 30:48.107
Entrance wound, right palm. Exit wound
on the foot. Let's try Trauma 2.

30:48.274 --> 30:49.943
- Need a room!
- We'll move next door.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.820
- In here!
- Careful with the baby. Can we crowd in?

30:52.987 --> 30:58.262
15 liters O-2 by mask.
Start him on an IV. Saline, TKO.

30:59.537 --> 31:02.958
Pulse ox.
Get him on a cardiac monitor.

31:03.124 --> 31:08.004
- Got a good vein here.
- Lidocaine 100 IV push.

31:08.171 --> 31:09.714
What about you? How you doing?

31:09.881 --> 31:13.135
When I knocked him away from the ladder,
I got a little jolt.

31:13.302 --> 31:15.554
Sit down. We'll take care of you.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.233
There you go.

31:30.111 --> 31:35.200
She is perfect.
Look at that, picture of health.

31:37.077 --> 31:40.373
Hello, beautiful. Hello.

31:43.960 --> 31:49.131
- I didn't think it'd be so hard.
- That's why they call it "labor. "

31:49.298 --> 31:53.845
I mean I didn't think it would
be so hard to see her...

31:54.012 --> 31:55.931
...when I know...

32:01.770 --> 32:07.694
I love you.
I will always love you.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.502
- Easiest birth I've ever seen.
- We don't give extra credit on the Apgar.

32:22.669 --> 32:25.922
But when they come out
reciting Shakespeare...

32:26.089 --> 32:29.675
- He takes after his mom.
- Couldn't have done it without you.

32:29.842 --> 32:33.472
We're still trying
to clone your husband.

32:34.515 --> 32:38.310
Could happen.
Little Thomas is a chemistry experiment.

32:38.477 --> 32:41.563
In vitro fertilization. Miracle baby.

32:41.897 --> 32:44.566
Dr. Ross?

32:45.192 --> 32:46.778
We set up an OB on six.

32:46.945 --> 32:49.864
We'll start transporting the women
and their newborns.

32:50.031 --> 32:51.699
We've got one close to delivery.

32:51.866 --> 32:57.121
That's eight mothers to transport
and nine healthy newborns.

32:57.288 --> 32:59.750
That's a nice ratio, Dr. Greene.

33:01.335 --> 33:02.753
Moms did all the work.

33:07.132 --> 33:10.010
Dr. Ross, this is Mr. Wilson.
His wife had the twins.

33:10.177 --> 33:11.595
- Hi.
- Dispatch called.

33:11.762 --> 33:13.890
I was on the Berkeley run.
Snowed in out there.

33:14.057 --> 33:18.020
It took three hours to get a relief driver,
almost three more to get me back in.

33:18.187 --> 33:20.606
- Want to see your kids?
- Sure would.

33:20.773 --> 33:22.775
Come on.

33:24.401 --> 33:26.488
Here you go.

33:26.655 --> 33:30.116
Boys, I'd like you to meet your father.

33:43.798 --> 33:46.467
I'm sorry I wasn't here for you guys.

33:46.634 --> 33:48.344
That's not how it's gonna be.

33:49.470 --> 33:52.974
I'm gonna always be here for you
whenever you need me.

33:53.141 --> 33:55.227
And sometimes
when you think you don't.

33:56.353 --> 33:58.688
I'm your dad.

33:59.272 --> 34:01.483
And that's my job.

34:04.653 --> 34:07.239
To be there.

34:11.452 --> 34:14.205
You're gonna be a great father.

34:14.371 --> 34:18.208
They say it's all about
the kind of start you get.

34:18.376 --> 34:22.214
- She's crowning, Dr. Ross.
- The crack baby? Excuse me.

34:25.510 --> 34:30.348
Push, push, push.
Good. Yeah.

34:30.514 --> 34:33.726
You have a little girl.

34:34.811 --> 34:37.231
- Is she okay?
- She's beautiful.

34:37.397 --> 34:41.025
- Is she breathing?
- Yes, she is.

34:43.362 --> 34:47.074
Apgar, seven. Head circumference
may be on the small side.

34:47.784 --> 34:49.369
- What does that mean?
- It means...

34:49.534 --> 34:52.496
...that your daughter,
for the moment, seems fine.

34:52.663 --> 34:56.708
You were doing crack while pregnant,
which causes developmental problems.

34:56.876 --> 35:00.881
Learning problems we may not know
about for years. I'm going to NICU.

35:01.048 --> 35:03.842
But you're bringing her back,
though, right?

35:04.009 --> 35:05.761
You're giving her back to me?

35:05.928 --> 35:09.723
- I'll get to have her?
- Yes, you probably will.

35:13.436 --> 35:16.189
So even though my family
was predisposed to law...

35:16.356 --> 35:19.275
...I was the black sheep
and decided to go into medicine.

35:19.984 --> 35:22.070
Shoot. Can I try again?

35:22.236 --> 35:26.533
The point is to tie the knot without
pulling the clip away from the magnet.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.077
I know.

35:28.243 --> 35:32.915
Mr. Carter, can you run through the steps
of an adrenalectomy?

35:33.082 --> 35:36.961
Sure. Identify the mass by CT.

35:37.128 --> 35:39.131
Make a Kocher incision.

35:41.175 --> 35:44.136
- I almost had it.
- What if that had been a patient...

35:44.303 --> 35:48.474
...and your inept technique caused
uncontrolled arterial hemorrhage?

35:48.641 --> 35:51.936
I would repair the damage...

35:52.604 --> 35:56.524
...and proceed.

35:58.860 --> 36:00.320
Good answer, Mr. Carter.

36:00.487 --> 36:05.116
It may not be possible to tie that knot
without dropping the magnet.

36:05.618 --> 36:07.953
But you didn't lose your cool,
and that matters.

36:08.120 --> 36:12.625
That and your academic records,
your board scores and your letters of rec.

36:12.792 --> 36:16.837
- Quite frankly-
- Vucelich sent his standard glowing report.

36:17.004 --> 36:20.133
Still didn't fix the typo
in the second paragraph.

36:20.300 --> 36:25.180
It's Dr. Benton's letter
that gives us the most pause.

36:25.347 --> 36:27.891
I am at a loss to explain-

36:28.058 --> 36:30.936
You're one of the first students
to survive Dr. Benton.

36:31.102 --> 36:35.149
But to have him use words like "solid"
in connection with surgical technique...

36:35.316 --> 36:36.609
High praise from Benton.

36:36.776 --> 36:41.572
Not to mention "full knowledge
of anatomy and diagnostic tools. "

36:41.739 --> 36:43.991
That's tantamount to gushing.

36:44.158 --> 36:47.663
- Are you sure he wrote this?
- He did.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.917
Well, you're a most
impressive candidate.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.669
But we have
many impressive candidates.

36:53.836 --> 36:57.173
One last thing.
Tell us why you want to be a surgeon.

37:06.141 --> 37:08.310
It's not a trick question.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.273
No.

37:15.735 --> 37:20.156
I see people with injury or disease...

37:22.033 --> 37:24.368
...and I know that I can fix them.

37:25.788 --> 37:27.748
So that's what I want to do.

37:34.546 --> 37:37.049
Excuse me, nurse.
How soon before they move her?

37:37.216 --> 37:39.219
It shouldn't be too long.

37:39.385 --> 37:41.554
You probably have time. I'm starving.

37:41.721 --> 37:44.933
I'll run to that diner across the street
and get her something to eat.

37:45.099 --> 37:48.937
I love that beet soup
I had there last night.

37:56.071 --> 37:58.406
Do you know what that lady
in Curtain 1 just said?

37:58.573 --> 38:00.158
- What?
- I'm out of here.

38:00.408 --> 38:04.204
- You're not gonna join us?
- No, sorry. I gotta see someone.

38:04.412 --> 38:08.375
- Join who?
- Leslie! Leslie!

38:16.383 --> 38:18.469
He's beautiful.

38:18.636 --> 38:23.099
- You two finally have your family.
- I'm so sorry I missed it.

38:23.266 --> 38:25.769
Thank you, Harris, for everything.

38:25.936 --> 38:28.563
We're making you two the godfathers.

38:28.980 --> 38:32.150
Too good to be true.

38:32.318 --> 38:34.904
Re-check his crit in 30 minutes.

38:35.071 --> 38:37.198
Don't forget, 15 mgs
per kilogram per minute.

38:37.364 --> 38:40.993
Page me if his systolic BP
drops under 100.

38:45.039 --> 38:48.460
- Carter, what are you doing here?
- Brought you dinner.

38:48.627 --> 38:51.630
Tofu, brown rice, veggies on the side.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.133
Thanks.

39:00.973 --> 39:04.644
I know it's been hard lately.

39:04.810 --> 39:08.982
I just wanna thank you, for setting
the bar high, for everything.

39:09.149 --> 39:11.860
For being a good example.

39:14.030 --> 39:16.991
The interview went okay, huh?

39:17.158 --> 39:20.203
It's hard to say. I think so.

39:20.369 --> 39:23.789
Is that guy gonna live?

39:23.956 --> 39:26.668
Yeah, I think so.

39:32.883 --> 39:37.179
It's just, now that I've seen her...

39:37.387 --> 39:39.057
She's so pretty.

39:39.265 --> 39:42.852
Yes, she is. But it's also
a huge responsibility.

39:43.019 --> 39:44.437
Not that much.

39:44.604 --> 39:46.856
I have a baby,
and it's an impossible job.

39:47.023 --> 39:48.858
You never think
you're doing well enough.

39:49.025 --> 39:50.485
My mom will help.

39:52.613 --> 39:55.491
I'd pay you guys back someday
for the prenatal stuff.

39:55.657 --> 39:57.826
We don't want the money.

39:57.993 --> 40:01.288
You shouldn't change your mind now
where everything's so emotional.

40:01.455 --> 40:04.374
Tina! My baby!

40:04.541 --> 40:07.045
Oh, look at this!

40:07.212 --> 40:09.088
- We tried to find you.
- A boy or a girl?

40:09.255 --> 40:11.883
- A girl.
- That's lucky.

40:12.050 --> 40:15.428
- She's just like you. Lots of hair.
- I think she knows me.

40:15.595 --> 40:17.806
She's got your eyes.

40:25.148 --> 40:27.734
- Look at that.
- I wanna keep her.

40:27.901 --> 40:31.613
Of course you do.
Look at that itty-bitty face.

40:53.595 --> 40:57.640
Excuse me, is there another
Hotel Dupree around this area?

40:57.807 --> 40:59.769
No, it's the only one. Problem?

40:59.935 --> 41:03.272
No, it's just not the dive I expected.

41:03.439 --> 41:05.941
I'm here to see a guest. Ray Ross?

41:06.108 --> 41:07.610
No, Mr. Ross is in the bar.

41:08.611 --> 41:10.946
- Why am I not surprised?
- But he isn't a guest.

41:11.113 --> 41:14.159
Mr. Ross owns this hotel.

41:19.956 --> 41:25.629
- Hey.
- Doug. What a surprise.

41:25.796 --> 41:28.008
- You found me.
- You left your number.

41:28.175 --> 41:30.135
Yeah.

41:30.302 --> 41:32.262
Come on, have a drink.

41:32.429 --> 41:36.391
Listen, Ray,
I just wanted to give you these.

41:37.976 --> 41:42.440
I was gonna play along, Ray,
like Mom and I always did.

41:42.607 --> 41:48.070
Kind of take your gifts
that drop out of the blue.

41:48.237 --> 41:52.784
I decided, no, not gonna
let you get away with it.

41:52.951 --> 41:56.205
Not this time. So...

41:57.414 --> 42:01.543
You're not my father.
A father is someone who was there.

42:01.710 --> 42:04.796
- You never were.
- I know. I'm sorry.

42:04.963 --> 42:06.758
You and your mother deserved better.

42:06.924 --> 42:09.594
- She did.
- You did too.

42:12.889 --> 42:15.433
- Hey, Jimmy, a bottle of Maker's here.
- Right away.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.852
I'm beat.
I delivered eight babies today.

42:18.019 --> 42:20.898
Yeah. Sure, I understand.

42:22.941 --> 42:28.238
The night you were born,
I swore I was a changed man.

42:29.615 --> 42:32.535
Your mother must have told you
how you came into this world.

42:32.702 --> 42:36.831
It's a hell of a story. She must
have told you about the skates, huh?

42:38.667 --> 42:41.795
She tell you about the skates?
We were at the cabin, and the lake-

42:41.962 --> 42:47.510
- The cabin, the one the bank took back?
- Well, that was a mix-up.

42:47.677 --> 42:51.181
You weren't due for another two weeks,
and your mother went into labor.

42:51.348 --> 42:55.185
- Right.
- And the lake was frozen over.

42:55.351 --> 42:58.938
The doctor was afraid to drive
across the ice.

42:59.105 --> 43:01.901
So there's your mother...

43:02.067 --> 43:05.654
...strapping on skates
between contractions.

43:05.821 --> 43:07.948
I thought I'd have to deliver you myself.

43:16.583 --> 43:20.462
- Where is everybody?
- You're the last one to clock out.

43:20.629 --> 43:24.924
- It's my last day for a while.
- Good luck.

44:10.433 --> 44:13.936
Excuse me.
Do you have any beet soup tonight?

44:14.103 --> 44:18.941
- You want the beet soup?
- Surprise!

44:19.902 --> 44:22.321
- Oh, they got you good!
- They did, didn't they?

44:22.487 --> 44:24.406
I hate you guys! I hate you!

44:24.573 --> 44:27.659
- Congratulations, any day now.
- We're so happy for you.

44:27.826 --> 44:30.162
- And happy it's not us.
- Well put.

44:30.329 --> 44:33.207
Here you go.
Little Susie liked it. I hope you do.

44:33.374 --> 44:37.170
One order of beet soup, and we
can rush back for Conni's delivery.

44:37.337 --> 44:39.672
I wish!

44:44.510 --> 44:46.847
Good shot. Are you out of breath?

44:47.056 --> 44:48.766
No, no, no. Get out of there!

44:51.685 --> 44:55.272
- You're getting slow in your old age.
- Come on, give me a break.

44:55.522 --> 44:58.526
No, you can't spin it!
Watch this one.

44:59.945 --> 45:03.449
Better guard. Score right there.

45:06.368 --> 45:09.872
- Rematch. Two out of three.
- What do you wanna play for?

45:11.915 --> 45:15.837
Tickets to the Bulls game.
One for each of us, all right?

45:17.422 --> 45:19.632
You're on. Let's go.

45:19.799 --> 45:23.053
- Come on.
- All right.

45:24.637 --> 45:28.392
Are you out of breath yet?
You need to sit down?

45:29.477 --> 45:32.438
Ready? Men are up.

45:32.605 --> 45:34.773
That's a score, champ. Ready?

45:35.305 --> 45:41.508
