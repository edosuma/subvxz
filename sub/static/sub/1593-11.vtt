WEBVTT

00:25.776 --> 00:27.312
Maggie:
Hey.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.274
Everyone...

00:33.034 --> 00:34.570
this is Aaron.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.702
We met him outside.
He's by himself.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.118
We took his weapons
and we took his gear.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.458
( chains rattling )

00:55.598 --> 00:57.259
Hi.

00:57.433 --> 01:00.266
(crying)

01:00.436 --> 01:03.348
Shh.

01:06.484 --> 01:07.974
It's nice to meet you.

01:10.154 --> 01:11.894
You said he had a weapon?

01:27.922 --> 01:29.628
There something you need?

01:29.799 --> 01:32.757
He has a camp nearby.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.758
He wants us to audition
for membership.

01:37.932 --> 01:41.049
| wish there was another word.

01:41.227 --> 01:44.811
Audition makes it sound like
we're some kind of a dance troupe.

01:44.981 --> 01:46.937
That's only on Friday nights.

01:51.529 --> 01:54.487
Um, and it's not a camp.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.522
It's a community.

01:56.701 --> 02:00.535
I think you all would make
valuable additions.

02:00.705 --> 02:02.991
But it's not my call.

02:04.542 --> 02:07.784
My job is to convince you all
to follow me back home.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.253
I know.

02:11.424 --> 02:13.756
If I were you,
I wouldn't go either.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.380
Sasha, can you
hand Rick my pack?

02:29.692 --> 02:32.559
Front pocket,
there's an envelope.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.774
There's no way I could
convince you to come with me

02:39.952 --> 02:42.238
just by talking
about our community.

02:42.413 --> 02:43.823
That's why I brought those.

02:43.998 --> 02:47.411
I apologize in advance
for the picture quality.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.200
We just found
an old camera store last--

02:49.378 --> 02:50.914
Nobody gives a shit.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.585
You're absolutely 100% right.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.764
That's the first picture
I wanted to show you

03:00.931 --> 03:03.798
because nothing I say about
our community will matter

03:03.976 --> 03:06.308
unless you know you'll be safe.

03:06.479 --> 03:09.186
If you join us, you will be.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.390
Each panel in that wall

03:12.568 --> 03:18.108
is a 15-foot-high,
12-foot-wide slab of solid steel

03:18.282 --> 03:22.651
framed by cold-rolled steel beams
and square tubing.

03:22.828 --> 03:27.492
Nothing alive or dead
gets through that without our say-so.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.827
Like I said, security
is obviously important.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.621
In fact, there's only
one resource

03:35.800 --> 03:38.587
more critical
to our community's survival--

03:38.761 --> 03:40.501
the people.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.972
Together we're strong.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.134
You can make us
even stronger.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.474
The next picture,
you'll see inside the gates.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.814
Our community
was first construc--

04:05.955 --> 04:08.822
(theme music playing )

04:45.661 --> 04:47.868
So we're clear,

04:48.038 --> 04:50.165
that look wasn't
a "let's attack that man" look.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.323
It was a "he seems like
an okay guy to me" look.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.207
We got to secure him.
Dump his pack.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.209
- Let's see what this guy really is.
- Rick.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.087
Everybody else,
we need eyes in every direction.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.919
They're coming for us.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.425
We might not know
how or when, but they are.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.305
Me and Sasha,
we didn't see him.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.886
If he had wanted
to hurt us, he could've.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.927
- Anybody see anything?
- Just a lot of places to hide.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.312
Rick:
All right, keep looking.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.189
What did you find?

05:19.278 --> 05:21.519
Never seen a gun like that before.

05:32.875 --> 05:36.083
(groaning)

05:39.757 --> 05:41.588
That's a hell
of a right cross there, Rick.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.257
Sit him up.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.090
- I think it's better if--
- It's okay.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.595
( groans )

05:48.766 --> 05:51.098
He's fine.
Sit him up.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.259
( groans )

05:55.898 --> 05:57.809
You're being cautious.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.018
I completely understand.

05:59.193 --> 06:02.185
How many of your people
are out there?

06:03.614 --> 06:06.026
You have a flare gun.
You have it to signal your people.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.111
How many of them are there?

06:09.119 --> 06:10.655
(sighs)

06:10.829 --> 06:13.821
- Does it matter?
- Yes.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.456
Yes, it does.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.458
I mean, of course,

06:18.629 --> 06:22.087
it matters how many people
are actually out there,

06:22.258 --> 06:24.419
but does it matter
how many people

06:24.593 --> 06:26.834
| tell you are out there?

06:27.012 --> 06:31.597
Because I'm pretty sure
no matter what number I say--

06:31.767 --> 06:33.974
eight,

06:34.144 --> 06:35.805
32,

06:35.980 --> 06:38.096
444,

06:38.274 --> 06:41.061
ze l'O--

06:41.235 --> 06:43.601
no matter what I say,
you're not going to trust me.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.440
Well, it's hard to trust anyone
who smiles

06:45.614 --> 06:47.024
after getting
punched in the face.

06:47.199 --> 06:50.532
How about a guy who leaves
bottles of water for you in the road?

06:56.041 --> 06:57.781
How long you people
been following us?

06:57.960 --> 07:00.622
Long enough to see that
you practically ignore

07:00.796 --> 07:03.754
a pack of roamers
on your trail.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.587
Long enough to see
that despite a lack of food and water,

07:09.680 --> 07:11.762
You're survivors

07:11.932 --> 07:14.423
and you're people.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.676
Like I said, and I hope

07:16.854 --> 07:19.561
you won't punch me
for saying it again,

07:19.732 --> 07:23.190
that is the most important
resource in the world.

07:39.001 --> 07:43.335
How many others are out there?

07:43.505 --> 07:45.211
One.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.048
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.553
If it's not words,
if it's not pictures,

07:56.727 --> 07:58.058
what would it take
to convince you

07:58.228 --> 08:00.219
that this is for real?

08:06.070 --> 08:07.935
What if I drove you
to the community?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.944
All of you?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.527
We leave now,
we'll get there by lunch.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.487
I'm not sure
how the 15 of us are gonna fit

08:14.662 --> 08:17.119
in the car you and your one friend
drove down here in.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.280
We drove separately.
If we found a group,

08:19.458 --> 08:20.994
we wanted to be able
to bring them all home.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.578
There's enough room
for all of us.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.620
And you're parked
just a couple miles away, right?

08:25.798 --> 08:28.289
East on Ridge Road,
just after you hit Route 16.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.174
We wanted to get them closer,
but then the storm came,

08:31.345 --> 08:33.256
blocked the road.
We couldn't clear it.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.092
Yeah, you've really
thought this through.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.757
Rick, if I wanted
to ambush you,

08:38.936 --> 08:40.597
I'd do it here.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.887
You know, light the barn on fire
while you slept,

08:43.065 --> 08:45.602
pick you off as you ran out
the only exit.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.566
You can trust me.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.153
I'll check out the cars.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.165
There aren't any cars.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.450
There's only one way
to find out.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.335
- We don't need to find out.
- We do.

09:08.590 --> 09:12.924
You know what you know
and you're sure of it,

09:13.095 --> 09:14.756
but I'm not.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.471
Maggie:
Me neither.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.686
Your way is dangerous,
mine isn't.

09:28.861 --> 09:31.352
Passing up someplace
where we can live?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.816
Where Judith can live?

09:33.991 --> 09:35.902
That's pretty dangerous.

09:37.661 --> 09:41.028
We need to find out what this is.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.165
We can handle ourselves.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.044
So that's what we're gonna do.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.963
Then |will, too.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.048
I'll go.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.676
Abraham.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.388
Yeah.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.017
|'|| walk with them.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.486
Rosita?

10:16.492 --> 10:18.733
Okay.

10:18.911 --> 10:21.573
If there's trouble,
you got enough firepower?

10:21.747 --> 10:23.738
We got what we got.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.375
The walkies are out ofjuice.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.709
If you're not back
in 60 minutes, we'll come.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.249
Which might be
just what they want.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.221
If we're all in here,
we're a target.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.426
I've got the area covered.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.889
All right, groups of two,
find somewhere safe within eyeshot.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.201
When the world
was still the world,

11:07.376 --> 11:09.662
I worked for an NGO.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.453
Our mission was to deliver
medicine and food

11:12.631 --> 11:14.872
to the Niger River Delta.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.508
Bad people pointed guns
in my face every other week.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.258
You're not bad people.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.764
You're not going to kill us.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.768
And we are definitely
not going to kill you.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.104
Just because
we're good people

11:31.275 --> 11:33.766
doesn't mean
we won't kill you.

11:35.404 --> 11:38.111
If the five of them
aren't back in an hour...

11:39.408 --> 11:42.275
I'll put a knife
in the base of your skull.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.541
Glenn:
Eyes open, everybody.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.411
Weapons up.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.502
You see someone
coming at us, you fire.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.416
Abraham:
Copy that.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.348
So if we see someone,
we just shoot them?

12:06.518 --> 12:08.850
It's a good question.

12:09.021 --> 12:11.262
Michonne:
What if they're someone like us?

12:11.440 --> 12:14.273
What if Aaron
is telling the truth?

12:14.443 --> 12:16.900
What if they're someone
who has nothing to do with this?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.732
Glenn: We're five people
walking with guns.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.398
No one's coming up
to say hello.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.988
But that's exactly what happened.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.784
If it's someone like us,
we should be afraid of them.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.992
He said he was
watching us, right?

12:34.004 --> 12:36.461
It means he saw us yesterday.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.712
And after everything
we've done,

12:37.883 --> 12:40.124
why would he want us
tojoin his group?

12:42.179 --> 12:45.671
People like us saved a priest.

12:47.351 --> 12:51.264
Saved a girl who rolled up
up to the prison with the Governor.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.806
Saved a crazy lady
with a sword.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.102
He saw that.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.112
I don't know what he saw.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.993
(Judith crying)

13:19.549 --> 13:21.540
(grunts)
Shh.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.881
You did see the jar of applesauce
in my bag, right?

13:28.225 --> 13:30.011
This isn't a trick.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.016
This isn't about trying
to make you like me.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.098
lt's self-preservation.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.684
Because if the roamers hear her
and come this way,

13:36.858 --> 13:39.270
I know I'll be the first to go.

13:42.614 --> 13:43.694
Shh, shh.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.072
All right,
come here, come here.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.859
Shh.

14:09.266 --> 14:12.099
You think I'm trying
to poison your baby daughter?

14:14.396 --> 14:17.012
l'm tied up and you've
already expressed

14:17.190 --> 14:19.476
a willingness
to stab me in the head.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.767
How would cruelly
killing your daughter in front of you

14:21.945 --> 14:24.106
in any way help the situation?

14:24.281 --> 14:26.818
Maybe she doesn't die.
Maybe she gets sick.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.324
Maybe you're the only one
that can help her and ljust lose.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.780
lam the only one who can help her
because I have applesauce

14:31.955 --> 14:33.946
and we all win.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.032
I hate applesauce.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.496
My mom used to make me
eat foods I didn't like

14:39.671 --> 14:41.627
to make me more manly.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.629
Salmon patties,
applesauce, and onions.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.791
She was a very confused woman
who tried her damndest.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.711
ljust bring the jar to show
that we have apple trees nearby.

14:50.307 --> 14:53.925
Like you said,
you'll be the first to go.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.609
The community is big enough.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.194
We can find a place
for you to live

15:10.368 --> 15:12.950
where even when she cries,

15:13.121 --> 15:16.534
no one, nothing can hear it
outside the walls.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.213
You got 43 minutes.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.792
(crying continues)

15:32.974 --> 15:35.511
He was telling the truth.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.487
( rustling )

15:49.658 --> 15:52.195
Glenn:
Not one step closer, asshole!

15:59.668 --> 16:01.954
(snarling )

16:04.923 --> 16:06.754
I got 'em.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.665
We got 'em.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.553
Damn it!

16:27.112 --> 16:28.602
Thanks.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.594
All clear?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.510
All clear.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.145
Gracious Ignatius.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.814
Oh, it has been a while.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.198
Foun
(chucMes)

17:19.372 --> 17:22.284
Son of a bitch knew
if he didn't toss 'em back,

17:27.464 --> 17:29.955
Back at the fire truck,

17:30.133 --> 17:31.964
after Eugene...

17:35.222 --> 17:38.134
did you think
l was gonna hurt you?

17:38.308 --> 17:39.889
No.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.763
It's not you.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.246
This, this is ours now.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.832
There's more than enough.

18:07.003 --> 18:10.996
lt's ours whether or not
we go to your camp.

18:11.174 --> 18:14.416
What do you mean?
Why wouldn't we go?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.085
Michonne:
If he were lying

18:17.264 --> 18:19.505
or if he wanted to hurt us...

18:20.850 --> 18:22.715
but he isn't...

18:23.937 --> 18:25.973
and he doesn't.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.189
We need this.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.067
So we're going, all of us.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.066
Somebody say something
if they feel differently.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.569
Daryl:
I don't know, man.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.619
This barn smells like horse shit.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.087
Yeah.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.340
We're going.

18:58.972 --> 19:02.556
So where are we going?
Where's your camp?

19:04.060 --> 19:06.221
Well, every time I've done this,

19:06.396 --> 19:10.184
I've been behind the wheel
driving recruits back.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.767
I believe you're good people.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.105
l've bet my life on it.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.896
I'm just not ready to bet
my friends' lives just yet.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.575
You're not driving.

19:20.744 --> 19:24.407
So if you want to get home,
you'll have to tell us how.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.828
Go north on Route 16.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.880
Michonne:
And then?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.175
I'll tell you when we get there.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.929
We'll take 23 north.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.475
You'll give us
directions from there.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.099
That's-- I don't know
how else to say it--

19:47.270 --> 19:48.510
that's a bad idea.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.098
We've cleared 16.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.604
It'll be faster.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.978
We'll take 23.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.270
We leave at sundown.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.780
We're doing this at night?

20:00.950 --> 20:02.656
Rick:
Look, I know it's dangerous.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.239
But it's better than
riding up to the gates during the day.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.029
If it isn't safe, we need to get gone
before they know we're there.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.324
No one is going to hurt you.

20:10.502 --> 20:13.369
You're trying to protect your group,
but you're putting them in danger.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.460
Tell me where the camp is,
we'll leave right now.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.890
It's going to be a long night.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.767
Eat.

20:29.938 --> 20:32.145
Get some rest if you can.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.149
( door opens)

20:43.660 --> 20:44.866
( door closes)

20:54.838 --> 20:58.501
I'm thinking you, me, and Glenn
drive with that guy.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.291
Carl and Judith are safer in there.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.008
You okay?

21:07.851 --> 21:09.967
When you said
that we were going...

21:11.688 --> 21:13.599
was that for real?

21:13.773 --> 21:16.856
Or are you just trying to get this guy
to tell you where his camp is?

21:20.989 --> 21:22.525
We're going.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.530
Whatever it takes to get there.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.363
Just as long as we get there.

21:30.874 --> 21:34.537
When you first came up
on the walls outside Woodbury...

21:36.629 --> 21:38.836
what did you hear?

21:39.007 --> 21:40.338
Nothing.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.215
And Terminus?

21:43.386 --> 21:45.001
Nothing.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.467
Sometime tonight,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.807
we'll be outside his camp's walls.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.222
And without seeing inside,

21:57.400 --> 22:00.642
I'm gonna have to decide
whether to bring my family in.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.697
He asked me before what it would take
for me to believe it was real.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.240
Truth is...

22:12.707 --> 22:16.040
I'm not sure if anything
could convince me to go in there.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.578
But I'm gonna see.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.629
I'm gonna see.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.770
( glove compartment clicks )

22:54.624 --> 22:59.163
Um, I'm trying to collect
all 50 states.

22:59.337 --> 23:02.044
Put them all on a wall
in my house.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.955
You have your own house?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.293
Mm.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.299
See for yourself.

23:39.002 --> 23:42.085
Why don't you have
any pictures of your people?

23:42.255 --> 23:44.667
Oh, I took a picture
of the whole group,

23:44.841 --> 23:46.331
but I didn't get
the exposure right.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.545
When I tried
to develop it later, itjust--

23:48.720 --> 23:50.051
Did you ask him the questions?

23:52.682 --> 23:54.092
No.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.349
How many walkers
have you killed?

24:02.358 --> 24:03.564
I'm sorry, what?

24:03.735 --> 24:05.225
How many?

24:10.199 --> 24:12.190
I don't know.
A lot.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.234
How many people?

24:17.707 --> 24:19.072
Two.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.116
Why?

24:23.212 --> 24:25.419
Because they tried to kill me.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.005
You were listening to us?

24:32.180 --> 24:33.386
I already said
I was watching you.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.057
- Yes, l was listening.
- It means his people

24:35.224 --> 24:36.839
could have one, too.
They could've heard our plan.

24:37.018 --> 24:38.554
- This isn't safe.
- Shit!

24:42.106 --> 24:44.188
- Rick: Glenn!
- They were right behind us.

24:44.359 --> 24:47.726
They would have hit us.
Now they can get out.

25:14.931 --> 25:18.139
( all breathing heavily )

25:21.062 --> 25:23.269
(walkers snarling )

25:24.273 --> 25:26.229
I don't see them.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.525
No, they're gone.
They got away.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.532
Rick: All right, we'll circle back
and find them. Let's go.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.704
- They're okay?
- Yeah.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.953
All right, we can take a left
a couple of miles up 23.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.463
- Jefferson Avenue.
- Jefferson Avenue.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.670
- Aaron: We gotta get out of here.
- ( engine sputtering )

25:53.845 --> 25:56.006
- Come on.
- Come on.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.719
(snarling )

26:00.893 --> 26:02.394
We got to get out of here.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.053
Come on.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.812
Let me see what I can see.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.348
They're coming right for us.

26:08.526 --> 26:11.563
- Yeah, we know.
- Glenn: Come on, come on!

26:21.956 --> 26:23.821
We need to leave now.

26:25.168 --> 26:27.079
Hold on.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.835
Shit.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.500
Who did that?

26:35.678 --> 26:38.420
I need to leave.
This is over.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.509
Let me out.
I need to get outta here. It's over.

26:40.683 --> 26:41.968
- What's going on?
- Let me out!

26:42.143 --> 26:43.474
Did you see that?

26:47.482 --> 26:50.349
Michonne, leave him!
We need to find our people.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.027
They saw that flare.
They'll think we shot it.

26:52.195 --> 26:54.982
- This is how we find them.
- ( walkers snarling )

27:18.888 --> 27:20.674
(gunshot)

27:23.226 --> 27:25.137
Where's Glenn?

27:42.954 --> 27:45.161
(grunting)

27:49.335 --> 27:51.747
( panting )

27:59.178 --> 28:01.920
- ( walker snarling )
- Aaron: Get off!

28:11.774 --> 28:13.981
( knife slices )

28:23.703 --> 28:25.785
( gunshots)

28:26.789 --> 28:29.121
Run if you want.
I got other things to worry about.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.203
We can make it together.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.787
But we can only make it together.

28:32.962 --> 28:37.126
You said that.
l was listening.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.299
Rick:
Glenn!

28:47.476 --> 28:49.307
He's got to be
somewhere around here.

28:49.478 --> 28:50.809
Michonne:
Glenn!

28:52.648 --> 28:54.309
(gun clicking)

28:58.988 --> 29:00.819
(snarling )

29:19.634 --> 29:21.590
(gunfire)

29:27.975 --> 29:31.968
If you really wanna tie me up again,
that's fine, but hurry up.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.264
There's no time.
We're going that way.

29:51.707 --> 29:54.369
Where are they?

29:54.543 --> 29:56.534
I don't know.

29:58.756 --> 30:01.543
If this is a trap to get us
back where you want us,

30:01.717 --> 30:04.049
your people are gonna
die tonight.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.220
Rick: The flare was towards
the water tower.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.433
( whistles )

30:20.069 --> 30:23.061
( whistles )

30:23.239 --> 30:25.855
( whistles )

30:34.834 --> 30:37.371
Dad!

30:40.006 --> 30:42.292
- Your sister okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.799
Aaron:
Eric? Eric?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.382
- Eric?
- ln here.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.139
Eric!

30:56.564 --> 30:58.850
Eric?

30:59.025 --> 31:00.060
I'm okay.

31:00.234 --> 31:01.815
It's like a volleyball injury.

31:01.986 --> 31:04.193
It's a broken ankle.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.819
At least that's what Maggie said.

31:05.990 --> 31:07.730
I like her.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.743
It's not a big deal.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.285
Oh, my God.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.826
I'll just go to the infirmary
when we get back.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.210
Oh...

31:32.683 --> 31:35.516
When I saw that flare go up, |--

31:35.686 --> 31:38.143
I thought...

31:38.314 --> 31:41.727
You were worried, were you?

31:41.901 --> 31:44.438
Yeah.

31:44.612 --> 31:46.648
(sighs)

31:46.822 --> 31:48.983
This is your fault, you know?

31:51.660 --> 31:54.493
Is that so?

31:54.663 --> 31:56.654
Because I love you.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.993
And because when I'm worried,
I do stupid things.

31:59.168 --> 32:02.660
And when I do stupid things,
I wind up underneath a rust bucket

32:02.838 --> 32:05.329
surrounded by roamers
who roll a rear passenger tire

32:05.508 --> 32:07.669
onto my left ankle.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.834
( chuckles )

32:10.012 --> 32:11.923
Hey, something good
came out of today.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.714
While I was waiting for you,
I searched through the neighborhood.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.679
I found that.

32:25.402 --> 32:28.189
You lost the license plates.

32:29.824 --> 32:32.236
I lost the car.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.536
( laughs)

32:34.703 --> 32:36.159
Maybe it's for the best.

32:36.330 --> 32:39.493
That monstrosity out front can run.

32:39.667 --> 32:42.625
It's so ugly, it'll scare
the roamers away.

32:42.795 --> 32:45.411
(laughing)

32:48.843 --> 32:51.630
Hi. I'm Eric.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.294
Rick.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.382
It's okay.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.896
( chatter)

33:09.071 --> 33:11.733
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.568
Everyone.

33:19.415 --> 33:20.825
Thank you.

33:23.252 --> 33:26.119
You saved Eric.

33:26.297 --> 33:29.881
I owe you.
All of you.

33:30.050 --> 33:33.087
And I will make sure
that debt is paid in full

33:33.262 --> 33:36.425
when we get
to our community.

33:36.599 --> 33:38.806
When we get to Alexandria.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.766
Now, I'm not sure about you,

33:44.940 --> 33:49.104
but I'd rather not do
any more driving tonight.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.732
Maybe we can hit the road
tomorrow morning.

33:52.907 --> 33:55.319
That sounds fine.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.777
But if we're staying
here for the night,

33:56.952 --> 33:58.567
you're sleeping over there.

33:58.746 --> 34:00.828
You really think
we gotta do that?

34:00.998 --> 34:04.661
It's the safe play.
We don't know you.

34:04.835 --> 34:07.076
The only way you're gonna stop me
from being with him right now

34:07.254 --> 34:09.791
is by shooting me.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.720
Whoa.

34:20.267 --> 34:24.135
Rick, he told us
where the camp is.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.931
And he really was only traveling
with one other person.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.237
They're both unarmed.

34:35.908 --> 34:38.365
I want us to be safe, too.

34:45.626 --> 34:48.493
I can't give up everything else.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.546
I know what I said,

34:52.716 --> 34:57.005
but it does matter.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.095
All right.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.619
- ( knocks )
- Yeah?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.785
-( pills rattle)
- Oh, um...

35:31.839 --> 35:33.204
I know it's time
for another dose,

35:33.382 --> 35:35.714
but I want to let him sleep
until we get home.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.045
No, it's for you.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.962
A few bottles.
Don't need to be stingy with 'em.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.339
I know how bad those hurt.

35:43.517 --> 35:45.348
Yeah.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.851
Thank you.

35:48.022 --> 35:50.855
Oh, your leg.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.765
Did that happen before?

35:58.157 --> 36:00.443
Duﬁng.

36:00.617 --> 36:03.609
Dad and me, car accident.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.532
Rotters in the road.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.702
I had a doctor.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.960
Probably lucky I can even walk.

36:15.007 --> 36:18.591
We have a pretty gifted
surgeon in Alexandria.

36:18.761 --> 36:20.467
His name's Pete.

36:20.637 --> 36:24.755
I've seen him do
some amazing things.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.924
He might be able to help.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.637
Yeah?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.146
Yeah.

36:38.572 --> 36:40.108
Yeah.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.361
Seven-card stud.
Stares and squares.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.871
lt's aces, cuatros, neeners,
and two-eyed jacks.

36:50.042 --> 36:53.534
Tara: So there's 14 wild cards?
Are you serious?

36:53.712 --> 36:56.169
Serious as two copulating dogs.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.962
Abraham.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.222
Look.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.235
Eyes on the road, champ.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.701
How much longer we got?

37:31.875 --> 37:35.367
Looks like we're a little
over halfway there. Why?

37:37.256 --> 37:39.668
We can make it.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.465
We can make it.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.557
( slams )
Can't win.

37:54.731 --> 37:57.689
Might as well paint it red,
put a ladder on it.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.191
All we need
is another battery.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.852
Where in the hell are we gonna
find another battery?

38:02.030 --> 38:04.362
Right over here.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.657
How'd you know
those were there?

38:14.835 --> 38:16.996
Come on.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.337
Michonne:
The fight's over.

38:26.889 --> 38:29.346
You've gotta let it go.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.677
I know it's hard.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.055
After it's kept you...

38:38.233 --> 38:41.896
warm and fed and...

38:42.070 --> 38:44.402
alive.

38:45.616 --> 38:49.200
But the fight...

38:50.913 --> 38:54.155
it turns on you.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.369
You've gotta let it go.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.915
That's what Bob was trying to
tell me back at the church.

39:07.054 --> 39:09.841
What to risk.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.097
When it's safe.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.676
When to let someone in.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.179
(sighs)

39:19.358 --> 39:22.771
The rules keep changing.

39:22.945 --> 39:25.482
They did for me.

39:30.244 --> 39:32.576
(engine starts)

39:32.746 --> 39:35.032
( cheering )

39:39.127 --> 39:41.960
Before we get going, I gotta--

39:42.130 --> 39:44.212
I gotta take a moment.

40:46.278 --> 40:49.520
(children shouting,
laughing )

40:52.868 --> 40:55.200
( people chatting )

41:06.131 --> 41:08.338
You ready?

41:20.562 --> 41:22.848
Yeah. Yeah.

41:44.419 --> 41:47.377
Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.469
Come here.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.093
Even though you were wrong,

41:59.267 --> 42:01.679
you were still right.

42:12.114 --> 42:14.105
( chuckles )

42:15.325 --> 42:17.156
Should we go?

42:22.958 --> 42:25.870
(theme music playing )
