00:05.233 --> 00:08.344
Ahhh Kitty. Making
brownies for breakfast?

00:08.382 --> 00:11.671
No. Brownies have too much
sugar to be a healthy breakfast.

00:11.802 --> 00:12.351
Here,

00:13.034 --> 00:15.202
have some Fun Time
Smack A Doodles.

00:17.696 --> 00:20.089
Ah, Mrs. Forman, can I
borrow your curling iron?

00:20.108 --> 00:23.089
I was gonna borrow Donna's
but hers smells like potatoes.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.593
It wasn't my fault!

00:25.892 --> 00:27.920
My Dad used it to
make curly fries.

00:29.326 --> 00:32.756
Well I wanna look good for my first
full day of work at the TV-station.

00:32.778 --> 00:36.913
I wanna look super pretty, so my co-workers
don't mind when I stab them in the back.

00:37.902 --> 00:39.858
You try my
hairstyling technique:

00:40.008 --> 00:42.034
"Wake up, remove pillow".

00:44.038 --> 00:48.688
You know, I am just so excited for you
working for TV's Christine St. George.

00:48.718 --> 00:52.342
She is my hero. She's
amazing, she's talented...

00:52.366 --> 00:53.650
She's the devil.

00:55.787 --> 00:57.472
She seems sweet to me.

00:57.555 --> 01:01.461
Last week, she was having a lot of fun
with this dog that could say Christine.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.990
It sounded like
"Wruurrreeennn".

01:07.787 --> 01:08.970
It was pretty good!

01:10.035 --> 01:13.323
Okay. Rumor has it that as
soon as the cameras went off,

01:13.808 --> 01:15.412
she had that dog neutered.

01:17.068 --> 01:21.781
Well I just can not believe that a woman who
makes her own pot-pourri could be that bad.

01:23.546 --> 01:28.430
Now if you're still nervous about her, just...just
do what I did when I first started at the hospital.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.202
Kitty I don't think she is
allowed to bring Kahlua to work.

01:35.235 --> 01:38.850
No you just...you bring in some
treats and put them on your desk.

01:38.888 --> 01:40.943
That's what I did
with my awful boss.

01:40.975 --> 01:45.922
Now he loves me, he weight 300 pounds
and he sweats when he ties his shoes

01:45.966 --> 01:46.973
I win!

01:49.195 --> 01:50.981
Here, take some brownies.

01:51.915 --> 01:54.471
Thanks. Well I guess it
is true what they say.

01:54.516 --> 01:56.823
Keep your friends close
and your enemies fat.

01:59.176 --> 02:02.060
You know, if you want to
impress them, do a good job.

02:02.358 --> 02:05.311
If your job is making
coffee, make coffee.

02:05.345 --> 02:07.873
If your job is answering
phones, answer phones.

02:07.915 --> 02:09.673
If your job is
sharpening pencils...

02:09.728 --> 02:11.740
Get a new job,
cause that one blows.

02:13.588 --> 02:16.992
You know what, this one, I'll try
anything cause Christine is a bitch.

02:18.015 --> 02:20.382
You know, that is
SUCH a double standard.

02:20.476 --> 02:22.653
Why is it okay for a
man to be a hard-ass boss

02:22.698 --> 02:25.322
but when a woman is,
she's labeled a bitch.

02:25.635 --> 02:27.380
Cause Christine's a bitch!

02:33.955 --> 02:35.632
Good morning Jackie!

02:35.895 --> 02:43.242
How are you enjoying your time behind the scenes
at the fifth larges TV market in Wisconsin?

02:44.176 --> 02:46.380
I don't know...I'm
working pretty hard...

02:46.415 --> 02:47.251
Well good.

02:47.295 --> 02:49.130
Oh, here are your
messages Ms. St. George.

02:49.156 --> 02:49.763
Great.

02:49.797 --> 02:51.640
And uh I also made a
new fresh pot of coffee.

02:51.675 --> 02:52.501
Wonderful.

02:52.527 --> 02:54.422
And I sharpened the
pencils on your desk.

02:55.386 --> 02:58.391
You... Are you
a complete MORON?

02:59.988 --> 03:04.081
Those pencils were a
gift! From Jane Paulie!

03:06.365 --> 03:10.481
Well they still say "Love
and Kisses Jane Pau"....

03:12.026 --> 03:15.491
ow would you like it if I
ruined something of yours

03:21.605 --> 03:22.950
That was your mug.

03:24.688 --> 03:27.331
My Ted Coppell mug!

03:29.958 --> 03:34.380
Listen, my job as
TV-host is to be...happy.

03:34.798 --> 03:38.232
And your job is
to keep me...happy.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.673
You screw up one more time
and you're out of here!

03:43.428 --> 03:47.563
Okay, everybody, let's
do a super good show!

03:50.385 --> 03:53.613

Why is there no orange
juice in my mini-fridge?

04:34.445 --> 04:35.881
I'll stock you right now.

04:35.928 --> 04:38.962
No. Dear. That would be
the answer to the question

04:38.998 --> 04:40.881
"when are you
going to stock it".

04:41.387 --> 04:45.852
My question was
whyyyyy is it empty?

04:47.575 --> 04:48.480
Uuuhhm...

04:50.905 --> 04:51.991
brownie?

04:53.176 --> 04:55.320
I WANT my orange juice!

04:55.345 --> 04:57.212
I don't want your leftovers.

04:57.236 --> 04:59.633
Do I look like a
homeless person to you?

05:01.625 --> 05:05.863
Ohhh oh. All I wanted you
to do is to try a brownie.

05:06.858 --> 05:09.283
Oh all right you big baby.

05:09.665 --> 05:11.520
I'll have one
of your brownies.

05:14.576 --> 05:15.482
Hmmmm!

05:17.045 --> 05:18.501
This is pretty good!

05:18.528 --> 05:19.722
- Really?!
- Uhuh.

05:21.086 --> 05:21.712
Well...

05:22.787 --> 05:23.942
thank you. Uhm,

05:24.687 --> 05:28.242
well all right I also made
up your schedule for tomorrow.

05:28.276 --> 05:30.831
Oh did you? Good
.Oh good job.

05:31.496 --> 05:32.291
Yeah.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.432
- Really?!
- Hmm-hmm.

05:36.746 --> 05:40.720
Great. Okay, the cancelled your appearance
with the boy who fell down the well.

05:40.747 --> 05:42.052
Ah thank God.

05:43.136 --> 05:46.442
Why are we celebrating that?

05:46.487 --> 05:48.640
The boy is just clumsy.

05:51.038 --> 05:54.433
Listen I'm sorry I
yelled at you earlier.

05:54.636 --> 05:58.273
Urgh, you must think
I'm a complete psycho.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.062
It was completely my fault.

06:00.297 --> 06:03.371
I should have just moved out of the
way when you threw that script at me.

06:03.415 --> 06:07.383
No, no, not at all,
because if you had,

06:07.415 --> 06:12.352
the script would have gone flying right
past you and might've hit somebody important

06:20.778 --> 06:22.012
What are you listening to?

06:22.247 --> 06:22.920
Nothing.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.580
Hyde is always giving me
crap about my poofy hair, so

06:26.625 --> 06:29.061
I use these sweet
babies to hold it down.

06:31.048 --> 06:33.292
Oh my God, look
at David Bowie.

06:33.317 --> 06:35.422
He's got a nicer
ass then I do!

06:38.047 --> 06:39.802
Randy, this is
where you disagree!

06:41.457 --> 06:42.773
I'd like to Donna,

06:42.826 --> 06:46.760
but he is wearing a dress. You're
wearing jeans. I'm very confused.

06:48.748 --> 06:51.750
All right. I gotta go to work, but
before I do, I have to do one thing

06:52.207 --> 06:54.103
HAHAHAHA!
Re-poofed your hair!

06:56.948 --> 06:59.440
Hey Randy, can you help that
chick sitting on the couch?

07:00.188 --> 07:01.670
Oh wait. That's you.

07:07.357 --> 07:08.142
Guys.

07:08.465 --> 07:10.383
Who put a sandwich
in the cash register?

07:11.316 --> 07:13.513
You can pay for things
with sandwiches?!

07:16.487 --> 07:18.311
Helloooo Hawaii!

07:20.266 --> 07:22.852
I did that Hyde. Sorry man.

07:22.885 --> 07:25.291
But I've been a little
scatterbrained lately.

07:26.176 --> 07:29.642
It's true. Cause I remember
when I first met you I thought...

07:29.716 --> 07:31.633
that guy is focused!

07:33.207 --> 07:36.391
Yeah. You've been acting
kinda weird even for you.

07:37.317 --> 07:38.612
Are you sober?

07:40.236 --> 07:41.831
No Aquarius.

07:43.528 --> 07:44.611
So what's wrong?

07:44.857 --> 07:46.893
I got a crush on someone.

07:47.097 --> 07:49.211
But I don't know
what to do about it.

07:49.437 --> 07:52.100
It's been al long time
since I've wooed a lady.

07:52.987 --> 07:56.731
First of, no-one uses the
phrase woo a lady anymore.

07:57.565 --> 08:00.200
THAT's why the girl
at the hub slapped me!

08:01.757 --> 08:05.852
No man, she slapped you because you
grabbed her ass and yelled: WOOOO a lady!

08:13.166 --> 08:15.792
Mrs. Forman, your
brownies saved my life!

08:15.825 --> 08:19.172
Christine was yelling at me all morning,
but then I gave her one of your brownies

08:19.207 --> 08:21.430
and then she
started liking me!

08:23.557 --> 08:25.550
Oh I don't believe
that for a minute.

08:27.055 --> 08:30.543
I could eat a whole tray of those
brownies and I still wouldn't like you.

08:31.915 --> 08:36.091
Red. Television's Christine
St. George LOVES my brownies,

08:36.126 --> 08:37.890
this is so exciting!

08:38.385 --> 08:42.373
I am IN a famous person's
stomach RIGHT NOW!

08:44.515 --> 08:47.882
Okay, well I need some more for
tomorrow so...could you make some?

08:47.915 --> 08:52.671
Oh. I just um...I just put Red's
chicken pot pie in the oven so...

08:56.576 --> 09:00.992
Here honey, eat around the chicken,
it is probably loaded with bacteria.

09:05.176 --> 09:06.273
Alright Leo,

09:06.516 --> 09:10.620
the problem that most guys have with picking
up chicks is that they over think things. So...

09:11.017 --> 09:12.001
you should be fine.

09:14.248 --> 09:16.670
All you have to
say to a lady is

09:16.875 --> 09:18.140
"Come here often?".

09:20.472 --> 09:22.528
If she says no,
grab her ass.

09:24.858 --> 09:27.784
You know she won't be coming back,
so you won't have to see her again.

09:29.588 --> 09:31.508
No. Look, I got an idea.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.592
Pretend we're at a bar and the
three of us are foxy ladies.

09:35.776 --> 09:40.041
Oeh, I'm a recent college graduate
with big boobs and an urge to explore!

09:43.707 --> 09:45.572
How's your daddy?

09:48.065 --> 09:50.360
Okay now, try to
pick one of us up.

09:53.846 --> 09:55.001
What are you doing man?

09:55.156 --> 09:56.681
You look the lightest.

09:57.158 --> 09:58.502
All right, put me down.

09:58.606 --> 09:59.460
Okay

09:59.858 --> 10:01.433
You're dumb and lazy

10:03.365 --> 10:05.151
There's my lady!

10:06.696 --> 10:07.691
Excuse me...

10:09.335 --> 10:11.042
you're blocking the aisle.

10:13.335 --> 10:14.132
Hey.

10:15.648 --> 10:16.413
Hi Leo.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.970
Come here often?

10:27.806 --> 10:29.630
Wow JJ!

10:29.778 --> 10:33.071
Seven jojo's at one time!

10:33.107 --> 10:36.701
I guess an act like that really
has it's ups and downs huh.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.521
I'm so glad I
fought for my country

10:41.556 --> 10:44.483
so that grown man can
play with his jojo.

10:45.006 --> 10:47.551
Oh shushy-shushy
grumpety-grump.

10:48.336 --> 10:55.032
Now before we go, I'd like to introduce the
newest family member of What's Up Wisconsin.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.753
She's my assistant.

10:56.788 --> 10:59.480
She's Jackie Burkhart!

10:59.515 --> 11:01.573
Come on honey,
come on in here!

11:01.726 --> 11:04.461
Oh my God, I'm on TV!

11:04.756 --> 11:08.570
Well for all of you watching in black
and white, I am wearing a navy twin set,

11:08.597 --> 11:11.061
my eye shadow is
periwinkle blue...

11:12.717 --> 11:15.992
HOLY MACARONI! It's Jackie!

11:16.038 --> 11:18.992
I know someone who is on TV!

11:19.588 --> 11:22.603
Waddaya know. It
really IS an idiot box.

11:24.545 --> 11:28.332
Jackie brings me the
most delicious brownies.

11:28.366 --> 11:30.153
BROWNIES! Red, those
are my brownies!

11:30.187 --> 11:32.791
Oh, they look so
much bigger on TV.

11:32.877 --> 11:37.432
So moist, you don't even
have to drink milk with them.

11:37.536 --> 11:39.082
NO MILK!

11:39.668 --> 11:43.153
That is the HIGHEST
compliment a brownie can have!

11:43.825 --> 11:47.293
Now Jackie darling, I must
know where you got them!

11:47.358 --> 11:49.890
FROM ME! SHE GOT
THEM FROM ME!!

11:50.597 --> 11:51.693
Got them?

11:53.285 --> 11:54.270
I made them.

11:54.868 --> 11:55.892
Myself.

11:56.295 --> 11:57.052
What?

11:58.308 --> 12:01.453
It's an old Burkhart
family recipe.

12:01.535 --> 12:04.440
YOU LYING LITTLE MIDGET!

12:09.116 --> 12:11.553
This might be a
bad time to ask.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.912
But are you gonna start
getting lunch together?

12:19.716 --> 12:21.512
I can't believe
Leo likes me!

12:23.738 --> 12:26.112
I feel like I'm back in the
third grade and the slow kid

12:26.175 --> 12:28.392
who picks his nose just
gave me a Valentine.

12:30.365 --> 12:32.272
See, that is what you
get for leading Leo on.

12:32.318 --> 12:36.211
With your tight jeans and your heaving
chest and your large bedroom window.

12:40.548 --> 12:43.830
You know, there is a good chance
Leo forgets this whole thing.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.782
Just like he forgot
that other thing.

12:45.825 --> 12:46.903
The sixties.

12:49.587 --> 12:52.431
Well what am I gonna do? I
don't wanna hurt his feelings.

12:52.477 --> 12:55.410
Donna, I know this is weird for
you, but you have to remember,

12:55.445 --> 12:57.980
it is Hi-Larious for us.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.641
I think Leo and you
could be great together.

13:02.906 --> 13:04.442
I can see it now...

14:19.348 --> 14:20.941
I have to go talk to him!

14:21.186 --> 14:23.231
I ain't havin' no Leo-baby!

14:29.296 --> 14:31.020
Mrs. Forman you
gotta help me!

14:31.045 --> 14:33.551
I need another batch of
brownies and I need them bad!

14:35.497 --> 14:38.223
Okay. First, preheat
the oven to 350,

14:38.256 --> 14:42.273
then stick your head inside and bake the
lies out of your lying mouth you little liar!

14:44.876 --> 14:48.293
Please! It's the only thing
that keeps Christine of my back.

14:49.238 --> 14:52.251
I'm gonna lose my job,
please, you've gotta help me!

14:53.536 --> 14:54.591
Please....!

14:55.726 --> 14:57.641
Oh that is SO fake.

14:58.427 --> 15:00.491
Oh damn fine. I'm sorry.

15:01.948 --> 15:05.460
Well Christine caught me off guard I
was on TV, I didn't know what to say.

15:05.496 --> 15:08.272
How about Kitty Forman
baked the brownies?

15:08.316 --> 15:10.180
See how easy that was?

15:10.227 --> 15:12.440
I can even say it backwards.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.862
Brownies the
baked Forman Kitty.

15:17.975 --> 15:19.502
Okay. Okay, you're right.

15:19.557 --> 15:22.480
But now I'm in too deep,
so I am begging you:

15:22.535 --> 15:24.551
please could you just
make some more brownies?

15:24.577 --> 15:25.653
Drop it Jackie.

15:25.677 --> 15:29.522
I am not gonna let you continue to
take credit for all of my hard work.

15:29.938 --> 15:32.821
What if I take you to the studio and
introduce you to Christine St. George?

15:34.455 --> 15:36.200
I'll get the eggs,
you grease the pan!

15:41.608 --> 15:44.182
Hyde, I thought you said Leo
was supposed to be here today?

15:44.516 --> 15:47.660
Yeah. I put him on the schedule.
Which means he is either on his way in,

15:47.696 --> 15:50.081
or on his way to San
Francisco to see the Dud Show.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.770
I just wanna get
this over with.

15:53.936 --> 15:55.500
It's gonna be so hard.

15:56.476 --> 15:58.332
Donna, I know
how you must feel.

15:58.945 --> 16:00.791
Soft and smooth...

16:04.505 --> 16:06.821
- There's my girl!
- Hi Leo.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.631
Leo, you didn't have
to get me chocolates.

16:11.668 --> 16:14.140
Chocolates? That's my lunch.

16:17.388 --> 16:18.332
Leo, look.

16:19.096 --> 16:21.370
I am really flattered
that you like me.

16:21.406 --> 16:23.933
But...I can't be
your girlfriend.

16:25.056 --> 16:26.953
Is it because I'm black?

16:30.245 --> 16:31.501
You're not black.

16:32.707 --> 16:34.613
So, it's not that then.

16:35.447 --> 16:36.931
I know what it is,

16:37.307 --> 16:39.090
you like that Randy guy.

16:39.217 --> 16:41.122
What? No, I don't.

16:41.156 --> 16:42.410
Yes, you do.

16:42.548 --> 16:45.733
So I think maybe it's best
that we stop seeing each other.

16:47.246 --> 16:48.521
Wait a minute,

16:48.958 --> 16:50.582
you're breaking up with me?

16:50.616 --> 16:53.150
I'm sorry but I just
can't date a racist.

16:59.205 --> 17:00.770
So man, how did it go?

17:01.075 --> 17:04.042
He thinks I like Randy!
Can you believe that?

17:04.078 --> 17:07.103
Donna. Leo has never been right
about anything in his life.

17:08.155 --> 17:09.902
Except for the fact
that you're into Randy.

17:11.535 --> 17:13.290
What are you talking about?

17:13.595 --> 17:16.852
Hiii Randy, I like music,
do you like music toooooo?

17:18.068 --> 17:19.123
Shut up.

17:19.238 --> 17:22.101
Look at my butt! I made
it just for youououuu!

17:23.316 --> 17:25.313
You are so far off!

17:25.347 --> 17:27.202
Come in man, you're in
the store more then I am!

17:27.238 --> 17:28.910
You giggle at
everything he says.

17:28.956 --> 17:31.190
You guys are like a
bad Carpenter song.

17:32.408 --> 17:34.421
You're like any
Carpenter song!

17:36.666 --> 17:39.582
Okay. Fine. Maybe I
like him a little bit.

17:39.767 --> 17:43.213
But if you tell anyone I
will freakin' kick your ass.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.540
You bitch!

17:49.177 --> 17:51.101
So Leo, you're single again.

17:52.195 --> 17:53.103
You gonna be ok?

17:53.135 --> 17:56.641
Yeah. I've already got
my eye on somebody better.

18:00.115 --> 18:01.091
Excuse me.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.302
Hey.

18:06.966 --> 18:08.521
Come here often?

18:16.197 --> 18:19.271
Join us tomorrow as
we examine the pain

18:19.305 --> 18:23.642
suffered from al local family
from religious prejudice.

18:24.185 --> 18:29.430
And Sparky, the water-skiing
squirrel will be here too!

18:29.476 --> 18:32.963
Until then: What's
Up, Wisconsin!

18:35.018 --> 18:37.530
Oh, Ms. St. George,
that was a great show.

18:37.568 --> 18:38.302
Thank you.

18:38.348 --> 18:41.470
Oh I would love for you to
meet one of your biggest fans.

18:41.517 --> 18:43.433
This is Kitty Forman...

18:43.478 --> 18:44.763
- Hello.
- Christine.

18:44.805 --> 18:47.553
Ohhh it is such an
honor to meet you.

18:48.207 --> 18:50.943
You look so much
taller in person.

18:51.337 --> 18:54.440
Of course we only have
a nineteen inch TV-set.

18:56.098 --> 18:56.913
Okayyy.

18:57.037 --> 18:59.070
I also brought
you some brownies.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.000
Oh isn't that
wonderful of her.

19:02.037 --> 19:05.522
You know Jackie, I was
thinking that on tomorrow's show

19:05.558 --> 19:08.032
you and I might
make these brownies.

19:08.077 --> 19:12.431
You know, you'd stir the eggs and
I'd come up with some funny yolks.

19:14.005 --> 19:16.171
A cooking segment?!

19:17.195 --> 19:21.472
Oh that is just...that is
just...just my dream come true!

19:22.438 --> 19:23.641
For you...

19:25.855 --> 19:29.211
Oh...Ms. St. George, I
have to tell you something.

19:29.896 --> 19:32.211
I didn't bake the
brownies, Kitty did.

19:32.256 --> 19:33.733
Who's Kitty, dear?

19:35.448 --> 19:38.581
- Uhm...that's me.
- Oh. Well,

19:38.628 --> 19:39.830
good for you.

19:41.108 --> 19:44.103
Would you uh give me just
a moment with my assistant?

19:44.158 --> 19:48.151
Oh of course. Would it be okay if I
just sat in your chair for a minute?

19:48.196 --> 19:52.460
Oh sure. My fake
casa is you fake casa!

19:55.205 --> 19:57.542
Okay Ms. St. George,
I'm really sorry.

19:57.668 --> 19:58.441
No.

19:59.255 --> 20:05.460
What you showed me just now, proves that
you are a sweet, honest, young woman.

20:05.605 --> 20:10.023
And that CRAP will get you
nowhere in show business!

20:10.718 --> 20:14.702
So what? Am I supposed to lie and cheat
and take credit for other people's work?

20:14.738 --> 20:17.422
That's how I paid
for my Mercedes.

20:18.197 --> 20:20.921
You can't be
afraid to be tough.

20:21.206 --> 20:24.752
Oh I'm tough. I'm
very very tough.

20:24.795 --> 20:27.103
People always say
what a bitch I am!

20:27.407 --> 20:30.400
Well, for your sake,
I hope they're right!

20:31.588 --> 20:35.152
Now please, get this
crazy lady off my set.

20:36.716 --> 20:38.871
Coming up next...

20:39.505 --> 20:43.740
A potato chip that looks
like Henry Kissinger...

20:53.808 --> 20:58.261
See if you can find that potato
chip. It sounds fascinating.

21:01.668 --> 21:04.002
Before we bring up
the tap-dancing parrot,

21:04.296 --> 21:07.990
I have a correction to
make from yesterday's show.

21:08.825 --> 21:11.973
RED! She's gonna say me name! Are you taping
it? Do you know how to use the machine?!

21:12.286 --> 21:14.501
YES...I know how to
use the machine...

21:15.207 --> 21:20.233
Those brownies I so enjoyed were
made by the talented and lovely

21:20.685 --> 21:21.753
Kitty Forshack.

21:23.265 --> 21:24.161
FORSHACK?

21:24.946 --> 21:27.602
No no that doesn't
sound rig...ahh...Forman!

21:28.055 --> 21:30.150
Kathy Forman.
