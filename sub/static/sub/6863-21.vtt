00:01.369 --> 00:04.238
The famous restaurant blogger,
Walter Wallen. If you'll

00:04.272 --> 00:07.541
excuse me, I'm gonna go
convince him to review Fancie's.
Whoa. This guy can do so much

00:07.575 --> 00:09.377
for restaurants, maybe I want
him reviewing the Rammer Jammer.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.544
I never do

00:10.578 --> 00:11.745
two reviews in one town,

00:11.779 --> 00:13.447
but there's a first time
for everything.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.349
Double Five Fork review.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.585
Oh, Davis, how come
you are so wonderful?

00:17.618 --> 00:19.353
And you forgot
handsome and charming.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.555
Didn't realize
y'all were so serious.
We are.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.424
Wade, I know that you feel
like I let you down, but

00:23.457 --> 00:26.260
no matter what either one of
us did, Charles and Vivian...

00:26.294 --> 00:28.262
Look, Zoe, I get you were
only trying to help,

00:28.296 --> 00:29.797
but it's probably better
that I don't interact with you.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.699
(Wade sighs)

00:43.111 --> 00:43.777
Knock, knock, knock.
(shrieks)

00:43.811 --> 00:45.379
And hello!
Brando!

00:45.413 --> 00:48.382
Hey, what-what are you
doing here, and so early?

00:48.416 --> 00:49.683
I had to come see you

00:49.717 --> 00:50.851
because you are responsible

00:50.884 --> 00:52.753
for the very best
thing in my world.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.522
I'm getting married!

00:54.555 --> 00:55.823
Sylvie Stephens said yes!

00:55.856 --> 00:57.791
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

00:57.825 --> 01:00.394
Never forget, you are the reason
this happened.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.596
You, Zoe Hart, are a love maker.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.598
I am. I should put that
on a business card.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.633
WADE:
Know what else

01:05.666 --> 01:07.835
you should put on a
business card? Your address.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.470
And then you
should memorize it

01:09.503 --> 01:11.705
so I don't keep getting your
crap delivered to my house.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.507
Wade, I was coming
to see you next.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.309
I just heard
the good news, Brando.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.577
Congrats. She's
a lucky lady.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.346
Uh, that is not
my crap, okay?

01:18.379 --> 01:19.847
My name isn't even
on the box.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.782
You are the only
person in this state

01:21.815 --> 01:23.417
who orders quilts
by the box.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.352
When the seasons change.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.520
And I already have my duvet
for this season.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.488
I-I'm gonna go.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.857
The wedding will be
in the next month or so.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.559
Oh, also, Sylvie would love it

01:31.592 --> 01:34.328
if the two of you would give
a reading together.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.864
There's a Shel Silverstein
poem...
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.667
Absolutely not.
I'm hearing you say
you'll think about it.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.535
I can't tell you

01:41.569 --> 01:43.737
how happy I am to share this.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.439
(laughs)
Oh, wow.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.341
What can I say?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.676
Sylvie turned me into a hugger.

01:48.709 --> 01:49.843
Oh, nice.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.479
So long.
Okay.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.647
Look what I made happen. Hmm.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.549
Hey! You know,
that's not mine.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.518
I'm not returning
your stupid box, Wade!

01:58.652 --> 02:01.555
Hmm. Zoe Hart,

02:01.589 --> 02:03.491
Love Maker.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.858
Nice.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.363
Well, I've got nothing
before 9:00.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.931
Well, I'm sorry.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.566
Blame Walter Wallen.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.168
But I promise,
it'll be worth it.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.903
(laughs)
BETTIE (singsongy):
You're welcome!

02:15.936 --> 02:18.406
I say you're welcome
because you're gonna thank me

02:18.439 --> 02:19.673
as soon as you hang up.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.576
Hang up.
(sighs)

02:22.610 --> 02:25.379
Grandma, what are
you doing here?

02:25.413 --> 02:26.614
I did it.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.416
I pulled every string,

02:28.449 --> 02:31.485
and I booked you on the Belles
and Bachelors Cruise.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.753
Oh, no.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.388
The S.S. Desperation?

02:34.422 --> 02:35.689
That's what we
used to call it.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.825
When you were younger
and had all your options.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.761
Now you'd better call it
your last best chance

02:40.794 --> 02:43.397
to find your perfect
Southern fiancé.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.799
(laughs)
So, you want to put me
out to sea

02:45.833 --> 02:48.802
for a month with a bunch
of Titanic-worshipping losers?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.638
It is a luxury liner

02:50.671 --> 02:52.540
with a very exclusive
passenger list,

02:52.573 --> 02:54.842
most of whom disembark engaged.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.411
It's Noah's Ark in reverse.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.679
(chuckles)

02:58.712 --> 03:00.414
You leave in four days.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.949
Uh, no, I don't.

03:01.982 --> 03:05.553
If you want to go get norovirus
on the Love Boat, you go.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.221
I'm very busy here.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.490
I have a very popular
restaurant to run.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.959
Well, there isn't
anybody here.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.228
That's because
we're not open yet!

03:14.262 --> 03:16.697
Hmm.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.500
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.635
I have a meeting
with Melanie LaRue,

03:21.669 --> 03:23.737
Southern Alabama's
most influential socialite,

03:23.771 --> 03:26.540
and she just might want to be
throwing her wedding here.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.877
Well... why don't you ask her
where she met her fiancé?

03:29.910 --> 03:33.547
I've got an Andrew Jackson
says she met him on the boat.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.583
Oh!

03:39.487 --> 03:41.855
Magnolia?
It's your grandmother.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.858
I need your help,
and I'm willing to pay.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.660
BRICK:
 No, no,

03:46.694 --> 03:49.730
and no, I am not interested
in having some unqualified

03:49.763 --> 03:51.999
16-year-old mentee
following me around.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.702
Unqualified? I will
have you know,

03:54.735 --> 03:57.671
I have seen every episode of
 House, most of them twice.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.573
And many, many
times I figured out

03:59.607 --> 04:01.041
what was wrong with those
people before House did.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.610
Hey. What's going on?

04:02.643 --> 04:03.711
I, Rose Hattenbarger,
have decided

04:03.744 --> 04:06.580
I might want to be a doctor,
so I want to shadow one

04:06.614 --> 04:07.681
for a few days.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.016
No way! That is so cool!
Shadow me!

04:09.049 --> 04:10.618
Yes, do that!

04:10.651 --> 04:11.485
No!

04:11.519 --> 04:13.687
Well, no offense,
but you're not tough

04:13.721 --> 04:16.490
and curmudgeonly
enough to be a mentor.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.492
I need Dr. Breeland to be
the short-tempered Meryl Streep

04:18.526 --> 04:19.760
to my wide-eyed Anne Hathaway,
so that

04:19.793 --> 04:21.028
I will eventually
win his respect.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.896
Your respect's
not that hard to win.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.499
Ouch. I think.
Oh.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.600
Crazy Earl's waiting for you.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.901
Earl? Is he lost?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.637
Says he's here for a physical.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.772
That's a first.
BRICK:
No!

04:31.805 --> 04:33.507
The answer is still...
BETTIE:
Bertram?

04:33.541 --> 04:35.909
I am taking you to lunch.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.945
We must talk about Lemon.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.882
Oh, Mother, uh, well,
you know I would love to,

04:41.915 --> 04:45.619
but, uh, actually,
I am spending the entire day

04:45.653 --> 04:47.621
being a mentor

04:47.655 --> 04:50.524
to the next generation
of physicians.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.025
ROSE: Yes.
The most important
work there is.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.327
(scoffs)

04:53.361 --> 04:55.363
Well, then, later
at family dinner.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.699
Amazing!

04:58.732 --> 05:00.534
Let the healing begin.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.704
And the healing begins
with you making coffee.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.975
(birds singing)

05:09.643 --> 05:12.346
Uh, sure, Burt Reynolds
ate the pool table.

05:12.380 --> 05:16.550
But where most men see
a problem, I saw an opportunity.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.751
A Ping-Pong table.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.353
Why not?

05:19.387 --> 05:21.689
(chuckles)
So, when you called me
this morning,

05:21.722 --> 05:23.557
said, "Hey, why don't you
come over for breakfast...?"

05:23.591 --> 05:24.625
Oh, we're gonna have breakfast.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.093
After we set up your toy.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.095
Oh! It's not a toy.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.998
This is a piece
of professional
athletic equipment.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.866
Well, then, maybe you should
have hired some professionals

05:32.900 --> 05:34.668
to put it together for you
instead of trying

05:34.702 --> 05:36.103
to trick your friend
into doing it for free.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.971
(door opens)
I'm paying you in pancakes.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.106
Uh-huh.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.674
Code Red, Mayor Hayes!

05:40.708 --> 05:42.676
Our perimeter
has been compromised!

05:42.710 --> 05:44.878
Frank, is that the freeway sign?

05:44.912 --> 05:47.781
It's a crime wave.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.884
I say, we find the little
bastards that did this

05:50.918 --> 05:53.721
and string 'em up
by their painty red hands.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.989
Know what I'm
looking at, George?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.592
A cautionary tale
on vigilante justice?

05:58.626 --> 06:00.594
Another opportunity.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.696
Look, look, here's what I
always hated about this sign.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.797
They put BlueBell
last, man.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.666
TOM:
That's right.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.669
That is primo, Grade-A BS.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.605
Yeah, and the state's gonna have
to make the new sign, anyway.

06:11.639 --> 06:14.007
Let's get the comptroller to
put our name first this time.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.075
That's a great idea.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.010
You want me to give 'em a call,
set up a meeting?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.612
Oh, better.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.681
No, invite him
to dinner tonight, my place.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.815
Yeah.
Yeah, you know
them city

06:21.849 --> 06:23.083
officials-- they
never get out.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.618
That's right.
That's a great idea.

06:24.652 --> 06:25.786
We'll bring him out,
schmooze him a little bit,

06:25.819 --> 06:26.920
show him
a couple of

06:26.954 --> 06:28.155
Super Bowl rings,
and, boom, new sign.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.724
I will call him
right now.
All right.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.626
What should I do?

06:32.660 --> 06:35.929
Oh, help me put together
this Ping-Pong table.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.631
I'll get you some pancakes.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.699
(laughs):
Oh!

06:38.732 --> 06:39.833
And breathe out.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.635
(exhales loudly)

06:41.669 --> 06:42.936
Lungs sound good.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.705
Feel good, too.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.939
None of that raspiness,

06:45.973 --> 06:47.140
no more coughing.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.176
Oh, yeah?
What changed?

06:49.209 --> 06:51.745
I want to live my life
with more intention.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.180
You know, be present.
Mm-hmm.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.649
Also, I quit drinking.
What?!

06:55.683 --> 06:56.884
I'm sorry. Did you just say...?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.853
Yup. Four weeks, two days
without a drop.

06:59.887 --> 07:00.954
Earl, that is great.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.656
What inspired this?
Oh.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.958
What inspires anyone
to do anything, really?

07:04.992 --> 07:07.027
I just wanted to be
my best self

07:07.060 --> 07:09.797
in case my best self
was called for.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.799
Oh, my God.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.467
Earl, you're in love.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.769
(gasps, laughs)
Damn, Doc,
you're good.

07:15.803 --> 07:19.072
Well, turns out-- and I was
reminded of that this morning--

07:19.106 --> 07:20.674
it's kind of my specialty.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.942
I'm so happy for you.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.010
Well, don't be too happy.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.880
I'm pretty sure Mae Ellen
doesn't even know I exist.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.817
Mae Ellen Waterloo,
the health inspector?
Yeah.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.920
Doc, I'm feeling things I didn't
think I'd ever feel again.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.489
And, no, this time,
it's not gas.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.090
That is... so romantic.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.759
Have you told her?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.794
I haven't spoken to her yet.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.696
I'm working up to it,

07:42.730 --> 07:43.897
getting in shape.

07:43.931 --> 07:44.998
One day I will.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.235
I tell myself...
anything is possible.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.138
Earl... you are right.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.842
And I'm glad you came to me,
'cause I know how to help you.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.943
Because, yes,

07:55.976 --> 07:57.945
anything is possible.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.479
(chuckles)
(laughs)

08:01.915 --> 08:05.218
Ms. LaRue, you already know how
Mr. Wallen feels about our food.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.955
Our room may not be the biggest
that you are looking at,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.023
but, I assure you,
you will find an intimacy here

08:10.057 --> 08:11.191
that you will not
find elsewhere.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.528
Well, there are going to be
a lot of eyes on this wedding.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.930
Do you think Fancie's is ready
to play on that stage?

08:16.964 --> 08:17.798
(laughs)
Melanie's

08:17.831 --> 08:19.867
worried about you
more than herself.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.069
She wants to make sure you're
ready to swim in the deep end.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.538
Oh, I assure you, we are ready.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.139
Well, I admit, I'm intrigued.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.741
(laughter)

08:27.775 --> 08:29.142
Now, I went to your Web site

08:29.176 --> 08:31.178
hoping to see photos
of weddings you've held here,

08:31.211 --> 08:33.046
but I couldn't find
your Web site.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.847
Melanie's concerned

08:34.881 --> 08:36.984
that your lack of Web presence
might indicate a certain

08:37.017 --> 08:38.284
professional naiveté.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.753
Well, about that...

08:39.787 --> 08:41.154
There was a candy store
called Fancie's.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.291
And also, what looked to be
an upscale escort service.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.026
(laughs)

08:46.059 --> 08:48.028
Well, honestly,

08:48.061 --> 08:50.330
after the review, all of that
traffic just crashed our site.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.766
But it will be back
up within the week.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.267
Well, I presume
there will be photos

08:54.301 --> 08:55.769
of weddings you've held here?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.037
You know it.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.271
Melanie just wants
to ensure that your...

08:58.305 --> 08:59.940
I get it.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.308
There will be photos.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.076
Lots and lots of photos.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.178
Mm.
(laughs)

09:06.346 --> 09:08.048
You know, by law,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.317
I'm allowed
to kick you out of this bar.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.185
Well, did you even
hear what I said?!

09:12.219 --> 09:13.320
Yeah, Earl quit drinking.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.988
Happens five times
a week. Good-bye.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.790
No. This is different, Wade.
He is in love.

09:16.824 --> 09:17.925
He even cleaned himself up

09:17.958 --> 09:19.326
for a woman
he hasn't even talked to yet.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.961
Why are you telling me?

09:20.994 --> 09:23.163
Isn't there something called
doctor-patient confidentiality

09:23.196 --> 09:25.899
or, as I like to call it,
leaving me the hell alone?

09:25.933 --> 09:28.035
Because however
you are feeling about me,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.337
he's your dad, and he needs
our help-- both of us.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.972
As we saw this morning,

09:32.005 --> 09:33.941
I have a gift
for putting people together.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.342
And as Alabama's foremost

09:35.375 --> 09:37.110
ladies' man,
you can give him some pointers.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.246
Zoe, if you think any
of this is gonna happen,

09:39.279 --> 09:40.347
you've clearly been drinking.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.215
The last thing Earl needs
is a date.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.116
Well, how can you say that?

09:43.150 --> 09:44.818
Decades of research.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.621
Last time Earl asked a girl out,
it was a five-alarm disaster.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.256
He showed up drunk,
in his underwear...

09:49.289 --> 09:51.024
in the wrong town.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.227
The humiliation sent him into a
lost weekend that lasted a week.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.063
He is ready to be in love.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.831
Okay, he wants this so badly,

09:57.865 --> 09:59.366
and you and me--
we can help him.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.868
See, that's the thing, Zoe.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.836
You and me--
we don't do things together.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.371
You know,
you're an even crappier son

10:04.404 --> 10:06.006
than you are a neighbor.
Mm-hmm.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.009
Fine. If you won't help him,
I will. You want to know why?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.010
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.079
Because anything is possible,
Wade. Anything.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.947
Yeah, see,
that's where I disagree.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.115
Not anything.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.150
(sighs)
Oh.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.955
(car horn honks)

10:21.989 --> 10:24.057
(seagulls calling)

10:24.091 --> 10:26.159
(birds singing)

10:34.101 --> 10:35.869
A.B., A.B.,
hey, hey, hey.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.971
Wake up. What's going
on with you? Hey.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.874
Sorry. Tired.
Up all night.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.243
Yes, I get it, new
boyfriend, amazing sex.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.678
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

10:44.712 --> 10:46.680
No, that's not it, it's....

10:46.714 --> 10:49.216
Nope, I take it back,
that's exactly it.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.419
How did I get so lucky to wind
up with an A-plus boyfriend?

10:52.452 --> 10:54.421
You know, a lesser-evolved
friend might just

10:54.454 --> 10:56.089
punch you right now.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.958
You don't think
he's too good to be true?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.127
No. I think that
your imagination

11:00.160 --> 11:02.229
could be better spent
helping me get photographs

11:02.262 --> 11:03.897
of a wedding in Fancie's

11:03.931 --> 11:06.166
up on a Web site by this
weekend so I can convince

11:06.199 --> 11:08.301
Melanie LaRue to have
her wedding there.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.004
What about staging a wedding?

11:11.038 --> 11:13.440
We, at this table,
do have experience

11:13.473 --> 11:16.143
in the dark arts
of relationship fakery.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.444
No, that won't work.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.046
Melanie LaRue will see
right through that

11:19.079 --> 11:20.180
and it'll blow
up in my face.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.450
I need photographs that
capture authentic emotions.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.452
Problem is-is, I don't know
anyone that's getting married.

11:25.485 --> 11:30.123
What about, uh, Brando Wilkes
marrying Joel's grandma?

11:30.157 --> 11:32.025
What... Seriously?

11:32.059 --> 11:33.160
When?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.028
I don't know.
Sometime next month.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.163
(gasps)

11:36.196 --> 11:37.364
Wade.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.932
Sweetheart.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.734
Former business
partner and

11:40.768 --> 11:42.369
once-upon-a-time fake boyfriend?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.337
Will you please
do me a favor and...
Convince

11:44.371 --> 11:46.206
two people I barely know
to move their wedding

11:46.239 --> 11:48.341
to four days from now in a town
where neither of them lives

11:48.375 --> 11:50.110
so you can get photos
for your restaurant?

11:50.143 --> 11:52.379
Yes.
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.015
Excuse me, can you
point me towards the owner?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.249
A Wade Kinsella?

11:56.283 --> 11:58.351
Well, take one step this way,
you're looking right at him.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.020
Robin Gilmartin.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.023
I read about you online and
I have a proposition for you.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.092
Is there a time
we could talk?
Well, I'd be crazy to turn down

12:05.125 --> 12:06.459
a proposition from a
pretty lady in a red dress.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.495
Ladies. This way.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.066
So. Brando Wilkes.
Mm-hmm.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.235
Now pinch the peel,

12:15.268 --> 12:17.170
apply just enough pressure
to get the needle through,

12:17.204 --> 12:19.239
and push.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.507
Like that?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.275
Boom. There's one orange
that's not

12:22.309 --> 12:23.977
gonna be getting
the flu this season.

12:24.011 --> 12:24.845
(laughs)
That is so cool.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.379
I can't wait to
try it on a person.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.514
Well, we...

12:27.547 --> 12:28.982
Guess who's home.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.383
Magnolia?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.987
What a nice surprise.
Uh-oh. Now,

12:34.021 --> 12:36.056
I didn't miss a call
from the dean, did I?
No.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.791
Grandma invited me home
for the weekend.
Oh.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.993
Something about wanting us
to be together as a family.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.029
Hi, Magnolia.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.331
We all...
miss you.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.300
Oh, is your little
pretend orange friend sick?

12:47.334 --> 12:50.037
No. I'm shadowing your father

12:50.070 --> 12:51.304
because I want to be a doctor.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.073
Wow.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.109
Awesome. That doesn't sound
like a loser thing to do at all.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.311
(chuckles) Dad, you have to
see pictures of my new dorm.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.281
It's totally retro. The whole
ceiling is Spice Girls.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.150
Sweetie, I want to hear
about all that at dinner.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.551
But I'm right in the middle
here. I promised Rose

13:04.584 --> 13:06.820
I'd show her some X rays.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.221
Seriously?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.289
Sergeant Jeffries'
kidney stones.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.392
A-And, technically, they are
called calcium deposits.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.394
And these are
as big as marbles.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.097
You-You got to see 'em.
Take a look at this, come here.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.436
ROSE: Wow. Gosh.
(laughs)

13:25.372 --> 13:27.107
Okay. Lamb chops
are on the grill,

13:27.140 --> 13:28.241
dessert is in the oven

13:28.275 --> 13:30.043
and what kind of Scotch
are you serving?

13:30.077 --> 13:32.379
Oh. Say hello
to my little friend.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.280
(gasps)

13:33.313 --> 13:36.449
The Glencallan
62 single malt.
Yeah.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.485
Only 12 bottles
of this ever made.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.386
(doorbell rings)

13:39.419 --> 13:42.255
Yup, or as I like
to call it, the, uh,

13:42.289 --> 13:45.525
"Sure, I'll change the sign if I
can have another glass" Scotch.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.294
(chuckles)
(laughs)

13:47.327 --> 13:49.162
All right.
(clears throat)

13:49.196 --> 13:50.363
Comptroller Riley.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.331
(laughs)

13:51.364 --> 13:53.333
Oh, you remember
town attorney George Tucker.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.068
Hi.
I-I'm so glad

13:55.102 --> 13:56.203
you could make it
on such short notice.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.272
Oh, oh, I-I hope you don't mind,
I brought a plus one.

13:59.306 --> 14:03.076
Uh, the more the merrier.
(laughs)

14:03.110 --> 14:04.912
Gainey?
Yeah, I brought you
a giant cheese wheel.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.348
It stinks.
Oh, it does, a little.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.083
Uh, turns out,
Mayor Gainey

14:10.117 --> 14:13.286
also called to discuss
exit signage tonight.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.223
It's a rare occasion I find
a babysitter for my kids, so I

14:16.256 --> 14:18.225
figured I'd kill
two birds with one meal.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.393
(chuckles) I... I hope
it's not a problem?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.629
Yeah, I'd hate
to be an inconvenience.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.364
Uh, is that the Glencallan

14:24.397 --> 14:26.466
single malt,
right there?
Purely decorative.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.336
Not for you.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.638
EARL:
 I don't understand

14:31.671 --> 14:34.274
why all this is necessary. I am
who I am.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.210
Of course you are. There's just
a little too much of you

14:37.244 --> 14:39.679
on the back of your neck,
your sideburns,

14:39.712 --> 14:42.449
coming out of your ears.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.351
I... (clears throat)

14:44.384 --> 14:46.319
You know, I have heard that Mae,

14:46.353 --> 14:49.222
while not a picky person,
prefers a close cut.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.359
More hygienic.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.127
All right, then.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.395
Let 'er rip.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.529
Ooh.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.331
Blue would bring
out your eyes,

14:58.365 --> 15:01.201
but white would
highlight your smile.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.170
Your pick.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.437
In addition to dancing,

15:04.471 --> 15:06.573
she is also interested
in climate change

15:06.606 --> 15:08.275
and Jennifer Weiner novels.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.542
And, as luck would have it...

15:09.576 --> 15:12.479
Her new book comes out today,
and Mae is in there right now.

15:14.714 --> 15:18.218
So, we're doing this, huh?
Start with your name,
firm handshake,

15:18.251 --> 15:19.419
and invite her to dinner.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.288
Well, what if she says no?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.690
Earl. Are you having dinner
with her at the moment?

15:23.723 --> 15:24.724
Right.
(short laugh)

15:24.757 --> 15:26.493
Nothing to lose.
Uh-uh.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.696
I'm Earl Kinsella
and I've got a lot to offer.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.215
*

15:54.521 --> 15:57.324
Well, of course
I love Fancie's.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.725
I mean, both times
I've been there,

15:58.758 --> 16:01.394
I didn't have to send
anything back.
(chuckles)

16:01.428 --> 16:05.498
Waiter, I'll have
what she's having.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.600
Harry Met Sally. Huh?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.202
Ah.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.603
Great, well, then it's settled.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.340
What? No. No, nothing's settled.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.509
I can offer you a 70%
friends and family discount

16:16.543 --> 16:18.345
if you get married this weekend.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.647
We-We just got engaged.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.351
You want me to tell Sylvie we're
getting married in four days?

16:24.384 --> 16:26.419
No offense, but you're
not getting any younger.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.987
Think about it.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.235
Something you need?
A glass

16:42.269 --> 16:44.371
of champagne, barkeep.
I'm celebrating.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.772
What am I celebrating,
you might ask?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.607
No, I most certainly won't.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.609
The fact that I stuck
to my guns and helped

16:49.642 --> 16:51.344
another lonely person find love.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.380
Oh.
Yep, as we speak,

16:53.413 --> 16:54.814
your father
is sitting down to dinner

16:54.847 --> 16:56.783
with the lovely
Mae Ellen Waterloo.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.452
That Mae Ellen Waterloo?

16:59.486 --> 17:00.587
Sorry to interrupt,

17:00.620 --> 17:01.821
but you haven't
heard from your father,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.356
have you?
He was supposed to

17:03.390 --> 17:04.757
pick me up
an hour ago and, well,

17:04.790 --> 17:06.358
I can't seem to track him down.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.694
You don't say.
Oh, come on.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.430
Hey, did you still want that
glass of champagne, Doc?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.608
Brando? Lemon Breeland.
Not trying to pressure you,

17:21.641 --> 17:24.711
but let Sylvie know I have a
great chuppa guy and... (gasps)

17:25.877 --> 17:28.615
Holy homegrown tomatoes.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.485
Davis Polk.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.787
L-Lemon?
AnnaBeth said that you
were too good to be true

17:34.821 --> 17:37.056
and she was right. I can't
believe that you're...

17:38.758 --> 17:40.593
Buying a ring?

17:40.627 --> 17:43.663
(exhales)
Thi-This is Eliza,

17:43.696 --> 17:45.832
my jewelry broker.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.700
Oh, my God.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.402
You're proposing?

17:50.803 --> 17:53.773
I'm so, so, so, so sorry. I
really like the one on the left.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.542
I am so,
so sorry.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.445
It's okay, this actually happens
more often than you'd think.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.347
Gi-Give us just a minute.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.548
Um...

18:02.749 --> 18:04.517
A-AnnaBeth's not
with you, is she?

18:04.551 --> 18:05.852
She's supposed to be
at book club.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.455
No, Davis, you are
crafty. (giggles)

18:08.488 --> 18:10.857
I-I know this seems quick,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.625
but I also
know I'm in love,

18:12.659 --> 18:14.761
and if AnnaBeth
feels the same, then...

18:14.794 --> 18:17.464
Carpe diem.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.832
Oh. That is so romantic.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.568
Well, how are you gonna do it?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.436
I'm gonna make
a special dessert,

18:23.470 --> 18:26.339
and bake the ring
into the cake and, um...

18:26.373 --> 18:27.607
What?
Ew.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.578
No, no, no, no, no. No-no ring
in the cake. Cliché. So boring.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.580
A.B. is my best friend, okay?
She deserves something

18:33.613 --> 18:36.349
magical, something befitting
of your relationship.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.784
Well, like what?

18:37.817 --> 18:41.554
Well... You know, just
off the top of my head,

18:41.588 --> 18:44.357
what if we were to turn
the dining room at Fancie's

18:44.391 --> 18:46.893
into the romantic backdrop
of A.B.'s dreams?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.661
And you know what?

18:48.695 --> 18:51.764
For no charge whatsoever,
I'll even take pictures.
(giggles)

18:51.798 --> 18:53.700
(exhales)
(exclaims)

18:53.733 --> 18:56.403
You know, maybe I should
check the Butterstick in case

18:56.436 --> 18:57.904
Earl got confused.
He was a little nervous.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.873
Zoe. Even Mae went
home. All right?

19:00.907 --> 19:02.642
You're the only person
who doesn't understand

19:02.675 --> 19:03.610
he ain't coming.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.778
No, of course he is.
Look, I can get Mae back.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.914
Will you just try
calling him again?
I already did, all right?

19:07.947 --> 19:09.382
He didn't answer.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.484
I just don't get it.
Really?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.952
Because I'm pretty sure
I explained it to you.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.387
Couple of times.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.888
Well, he was serious about this.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.690
Look, he's changed.
You didn't see him today.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.926
He was so excited.
I'm sure he was.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.495
But excited turns to nervous,
nervous turns to drunk.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.931
It's the Earl Kinsella
circle of life. Now,

19:24.964 --> 19:27.600
if somebody hadn't gotten
him excited about something

19:27.634 --> 19:28.468
in the first place...

19:28.501 --> 19:30.703
You are not suggesting that I...
Can't

19:30.737 --> 19:32.739
help hijacking
people's lives?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.841
He came to me.
And asked for advice.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.543
I am a love maker.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.778
Maybe you should say it
a little bit louder,

19:38.811 --> 19:40.813
'cause I'm not sure if
the people on table five

19:40.847 --> 19:42.615
have actually fully lost
their appetites yet.

19:42.649 --> 19:43.716
(sighs)

19:43.750 --> 19:45.418
Look, aren't you
just a little worried

19:45.452 --> 19:46.553
that something
may have happened?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.788
Like what? Abducted by aliens?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.790
Eaten by an
alligator? Zoe,

19:50.823 --> 19:52.492
he's sleeping it off
on a park bench.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.727
If you want, I'll give you a
list of his top ten favorites.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.630
You're wrong.
And I'm going to find him.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.766
Knock yourself out.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.534
Seriously, you're not coming?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.270
I got a business to run.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.575
Good luck, Sparky.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.445
Now, this will
be Lemon's seat.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.580
But that's where I sit.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.714
Not tonight.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.450
I want Lemon's back
against the wall.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.953
Now, you remember
your part, right?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.790
I'm to elegantly find
a way to remind Lemon

20:23.823 --> 20:25.725
of the Disney movies
that we used to love

20:25.758 --> 20:26.893
where the princess
got married

20:26.926 --> 20:28.728
and the witch was
a lonely old lady

20:28.761 --> 20:29.996
who never settled down
because she refused

20:30.029 --> 20:31.698
to go on the debutante
cruise and she

20:31.731 --> 20:33.032
got uglier until she died alone.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.468
Mm-hmm.
I expect to be paid in cash.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.470
They should be here by now.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.473
Your sister's
trying to duck me.
(phone chimes)

20:40.507 --> 20:42.509
And Daddy texted
he's working late.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.511
When I'm home for the weekend.
Unbelievable.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.514
I want you to go down to
Fancie's and collect Lemon.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.015
'Cause I'm gonna confront her

20:49.048 --> 20:51.718
with the cold, hard truth
of her spinsterhood.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.921
Fine, but I'm making
one stop first. Hmm.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.023
The sign should go BlueBell,
Hayes, what you're
suggesting makes absolutely

20:57.056 --> 20:59.492
no sense whatsoever.
Fairhope, Fillmore.
It's called alphabetical order.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.994
Oh, the alphabetical order card.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.030
The hobgoblin of small minds.

21:04.063 --> 21:07.667
It's a fact! "B" comes
before "F." Always has,

21:07.700 --> 21:08.668
always will.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.769
Can we be practical?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.904
Who's getting off the freeway
for BlueBell anyway?

21:11.938 --> 21:13.706
Y'all having another one
of them Hug Festivals?

21:13.740 --> 21:15.308
A come-see-
the-town-

21:15.342 --> 21:16.809
that-didn't-get-
the-county-fair-palooza?

21:16.843 --> 21:17.810
GEORGE:
Okay.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.045
Comptroller Riley...
(chuckles)

21:19.078 --> 21:20.580
what are your thoughts here?

21:20.613 --> 21:22.749
I never did care
for nuts in my salad.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.817
But-but this dressing,
what is it?

21:24.851 --> 21:26.653
Herb vinaigrette.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.554
Oh.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.956
What about the sign?

21:29.989 --> 21:31.758
BlueBell deserves top billing.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.526
We are an historical landmark...

21:33.560 --> 21:34.961
Because of a commode.
Blah, blah,

21:34.994 --> 21:36.963
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.833
GEORGE:
I think
what Comptroller Riley

21:40.867 --> 21:43.336
is trying to say here is
that he's heard enough.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.938
We're gonna settle this the same
way I settle disputes at home.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.874
A little competition.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.810
What kind of competition?

21:50.843 --> 21:52.612
Frankly, I'd like
to see you two duel it out

21:52.645 --> 21:53.713
with pistols at dawn.

21:53.746 --> 21:54.647
GEORGE:
Okay, well, how about

21:54.681 --> 21:55.848
something from this century?

21:55.882 --> 21:57.950
With a little less guns
and death.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.886
I did see a Ping-Pong table
in the other room.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.988
Best of five?

22:02.021 --> 22:03.890
Winner gets top billing
on the sign.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.057
Done.
Game on.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.559
Someone crack
that bottle of Scotch

22:06.593 --> 22:07.727
and point me towards a couch.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.565
Hey, Robin, uh,
Wade Kinsella here.

22:12.599 --> 22:13.966
Listen, I read your proposal--

22:14.000 --> 22:16.769
a couple times,
actually-- and, uh,

22:16.803 --> 22:18.971
I am most definitely interested.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.006
Call me back.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.110
What?

22:24.143 --> 22:26.379
A bunch of us have
bets on who she is.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.382
This mystery girl who
spun your head earlier.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.917
Sal says mail-order bride,

22:30.950 --> 22:33.786
Frank says undercover cop
trying to pull you into a sting,

22:33.820 --> 22:35.755
and I'm going with
either foreign diplomat

22:35.788 --> 22:38.691
or Pilates guru. So?

22:38.725 --> 22:41.694
So y'all need
to get some hobbies.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.129
(thumping on mic)
Howdy, everyone.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.997
How y'all doing tonight?
(cheering and applause)

22:45.031 --> 22:47.600
You're letting
Lily Anne sing here?

22:47.634 --> 22:49.769
She promised
she wasn't gonna sing about me.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.138
I'm gonna open up
with a dedication

22:52.171 --> 22:55.007
to a very special guy,
a man that I am just...

22:55.041 --> 22:57.109
crazy about.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.012
Did you get that in writing?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.614
* We met in BlueBell

23:01.648 --> 23:04.150
* You sang like a dove

23:04.183 --> 23:07.620
* I fell under your spell

23:07.654 --> 23:08.955
* And now we're in love

23:08.988 --> 23:10.890
* You're smart
and you're sweet *

23:10.923 --> 23:12.925
* Charming and hunky

23:12.959 --> 23:15.027
* That's why
you will always be *

23:15.061 --> 23:17.630
* My love monkey

23:17.664 --> 23:19.432
* My

23:19.466 --> 23:22.168
* Love monkey.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.036
(applause)
Thank you, darlin'.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.138
Stand up, my little love monkey.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.642
(whoops)
I am her love monkey.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.678
Her primate of passion.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.147
(exhales)

23:36.849 --> 23:38.184
This is Meatball, and...

23:38.217 --> 23:40.653
we're getting
married, y'all.
(chuckles)

23:40.687 --> 23:43.089
(cheering and applause)

23:43.122 --> 23:46.058
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Meatball and Lily Anne?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.094
Anything's possible, right?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.162
Why do people keep saying that?

23:50.196 --> 23:52.965
'Cause it's true, dummy. Look.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.203
Ew.

23:57.236 --> 24:00.106
ZOE:
Earl!

24:01.140 --> 24:03.776
Where are you?

24:03.810 --> 24:05.211
(sighs)

24:05.244 --> 24:07.079
Oh,

24:07.113 --> 24:09.682
Earl.
(sighs)

24:09.716 --> 24:11.718
EARL:
Can anyone
hear me?!

24:11.751 --> 24:13.820
Anyone!

24:13.853 --> 24:15.221
I'm out here!

24:15.254 --> 24:16.723
Earl?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.090
Zoe?!

24:18.124 --> 24:19.692
Back here!
I'm stuck!

24:19.726 --> 24:20.827
Where?

24:20.860 --> 24:22.228
My booby trap!

24:22.261 --> 24:24.797
Your what?

24:24.831 --> 24:26.699
Just follow
my voice!

24:26.733 --> 24:27.834
What?

24:27.867 --> 24:30.236
Where? Where are you talking...
(yelps)

24:30.269 --> 24:33.039
(screams)

24:33.072 --> 24:34.106
(pants)

24:34.140 --> 24:35.842
Holy crap.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.243
(exhales)

24:37.276 --> 24:39.111
Earl, what the hell?

24:39.145 --> 24:40.847
Did I miss my date?

24:48.154 --> 24:50.022
How did this happen?

24:50.056 --> 24:53.726
Well, a couple years ago, I went
through a survivalist phase

24:53.760 --> 24:57.129
and I bought a manual
and built a booby trap.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.865
No, how did you wind up in it?

24:58.898 --> 25:00.166
Same way you did.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.934
Were you drinking?

25:01.968 --> 25:03.269
Almost.

25:03.302 --> 25:06.973
Truth is, after Mae agreed
to have dinner with me,

25:07.006 --> 25:09.876
all this pressure hit me
like a tsunami.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.210
I could barely breathe.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.212
So I picked
up a bottle,

25:13.245 --> 25:15.281
brought it home.
But before

25:15.314 --> 25:17.750
I took a drink,
I remembered what you said.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.752
How I have a lot to offer.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.788
How I didn't want
to mess that up.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.189
Well, good for you.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.157
So I poured it out,

25:25.191 --> 25:27.293
took a walk to
clear my head

25:27.326 --> 25:29.295
and, bam, fell down a hole,

25:29.328 --> 25:31.297
stone-cold sober.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.899
That's a first.

25:32.932 --> 25:36.102
(groans)
I don't have a signal.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.170
You know, maybe
if-if you give me a boost,

25:38.204 --> 25:39.872
I can pull myself out of here.

25:39.906 --> 25:40.873
Uh, I wish I could.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.142
I think I sprained my
ankle on the way down.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.877
I'm having trouble
standing up.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.779
What? When I asked you,
you said you were okay.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.781
I thought you meant emotionally.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.116
Let me see your foot.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.184
WADE:
I must say, I've never been
so disappointed

25:52.218 --> 25:53.820
by something so predictable.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.988
I thought you had
a business to run.
Well,

25:56.022 --> 25:57.924
you had me convinced
that he wasn't drunk

25:57.957 --> 26:00.259
and lying in a ditch,
so I had to see for myself.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.994
You would
call this

26:02.028 --> 26:02.995
a ditch, right?

26:03.029 --> 26:03.996
It's a booby trap.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.031
ZOE:
Also,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.165
not drunk.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.800
How does it feel to be wrong?

26:07.834 --> 26:09.869
How do you still manage
to sound high on your horse

26:09.902 --> 26:11.170
when you're stuck
in a damn hole?

26:11.203 --> 26:12.805
Are you gonna
get us out of here?

26:12.839 --> 26:13.806
EARL:
There's a ladder
in the shed.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.041
Of course there is.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.809
'Cause you're prepared
for moments like these.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.577
(sighs)

26:19.879 --> 26:22.815
He really can be a jackass
sometimes, can't he?

26:22.849 --> 26:24.083
Sometimes?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.085
Come on.
Let's get that shoe off.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.088
Wait, what do you mean that you
booked Crickett and Stanley

26:29.121 --> 26:30.623
in Fancie's?
Oh, it turns out

26:30.657 --> 26:33.225
they want to renew their vows.
A big photogenic event.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.928
It just seemed perfect,
considering that's
what you needed...

26:35.962 --> 26:39.031
Yeah, well, it would've been had
I not convinced Brando Wilkes

26:39.065 --> 26:41.033
to have his wedding at Fancie's
this weekend.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.035
Well, that seemed
like such a long shot.
Uh,

26:43.069 --> 26:45.337
my powers of persuasion
have not yet begun to fade.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.841
There's one teeny-tiny
other thing.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.042
(phone rings)

26:50.076 --> 26:51.177
Meatball?

26:51.210 --> 26:52.244
That's the teeny-tiny
other thing.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.080
Hello.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.348
Lemon. Meatball.
I'm getting married!

26:56.382 --> 26:57.984
A.B. told me

26:58.017 --> 26:59.652
about your friends
and family discount.

26:59.686 --> 27:02.955
I'm assuming former lovers
qualify.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.290
(exhales)

27:09.228 --> 27:11.130
Booyah!

27:11.163 --> 27:13.265
It helps if your paddle actually
makes contact with the ball,

27:13.299 --> 27:15.401
Hayes.
Going with the old
Belarusian backspin, are you?

27:15.434 --> 27:16.402
Uh-huh.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.871
That's how you want to play?

27:18.905 --> 27:20.306
No better way
to neutralize

27:20.339 --> 27:22.408
your Jorgen Persson push.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.176
Okay, don't let him get
in your head, Lavon.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.879
I'm pretty sure
he made that last term up.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.415
You know the worst thing
about being comptroller?

27:29.448 --> 27:31.317
No one knows
how to pronounce it.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.886
Is it comptroller?
Controller?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.387
(chuckles)
And the jokes.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.157
"Try to comptrol yourself."
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

27:38.190 --> 27:40.960
That never gets old.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.895
Scotch me.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.130
Not bad.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.899
A bit too relaxed
for someone down two points.
Uh-huh.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.435
Maybe 'cause I know something
you don't.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.704
I ain't left-handed.
Hey,

27:51.738 --> 27:53.706
what do you know.
Hate to break it to you,

27:53.740 --> 27:56.242
but the same goes for me,
only the opposite.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.309
With the other hand.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.210
What?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.980
I, too, have been playing
with a hand

28:01.013 --> 28:02.148
that is not my left.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.350
Or my right.

28:04.383 --> 28:07.086
I mean,
the one I'm not as good with.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.321
What are you talking about, man?

28:09.355 --> 28:11.457
Quit confusing me
with your words.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.730
(door shuts)
MAGNOLIA:
All right, Single White Female,

28:17.764 --> 28:19.331
what have you done with my dad?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.233
Hmm, let me guess.
He's planning

28:21.267 --> 28:23.402
your college tour?
Buying you a new car?

28:23.435 --> 28:25.104
A nice convertible?

28:25.137 --> 28:28.207
Um, no. He's in the basement,
getting X rays from storage.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.109
He's gonna show me
the difference between pneumonia

28:30.142 --> 28:31.177
and pulmonary edema.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.945
Seriously?

28:32.979 --> 28:34.080
He hasn't

28:34.113 --> 28:35.281
shown me any of those.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.049
I love Pulmonary Edema.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.251
I watched them perform live
at Coachella.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.053
No. O-Okay.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.355
Pulmonary edema
is a lung disease.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.091
And I imagine
Dr. Breeland

28:45.124 --> 28:47.059
never showed them to you because
you've never shown an interest

28:47.093 --> 28:48.360
in respiratory ailments.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.097
Oh, really?
Well, here's a thought.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.165
Why don't we have
Dr. Breeland show you

28:53.199 --> 28:55.167
how to remove a pencil
from your ear,

28:55.201 --> 28:57.303
because if you keep talking
to me in that tone,

28:57.336 --> 29:00.139
there's a 90% chance
that that's gonna happen.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.411
Earl, your foot's
really swollen.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.412
What's going on here?

29:06.445 --> 29:09.248
Hey, so if it turns out
I only have the strength

29:09.281 --> 29:10.382
to save one of y'all,

29:10.416 --> 29:12.318
you gonna flip
a coin or what?

29:12.351 --> 29:15.321
Save Zoe first. Then maybe
she'll start liking you again.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.189
Hmm.
Though I don't know
why she would.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.991
(gasps)

29:19.025 --> 29:20.292
Aah!
Oh, crap.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.527
What is it?
What's the matter with him?

29:21.560 --> 29:24.063
Stay with me, Earl.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.165
It's a dislocated
spiral fracture above his ankle.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.100
There's no circulation.
Is he okay?

29:28.134 --> 29:29.535
Call 911 and then get down here
and help me

29:29.568 --> 29:31.070
or he's gonna lose his foot.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.349
He's still out.
Well, his vitals
are still strong.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.217
That's probably
the best thing for him.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.019
It's a bad break. The angle

29:47.053 --> 29:49.288
is pinching an artery and it's
stopping blood flow to his foot.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.556
We're gonna need
opposing traction.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.124
Smaller words, Doc.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.026
Okay. But you're not gonna
like 'em.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.228
We need to hold opposite ends
of his leg and pull.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.396
Like tug-of-war.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.531
And if we're lucky, the bone
will pop back into place.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.566
It's field medicine.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.168
It's as grisly as
it sounds. Here.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.070
Give me your hand.
Pull here. Okay?

30:04.103 --> 30:06.238
He picked a hell of a
day to stop drinking.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.107
We can do this,
but we have to do it right now.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.341
Got you.
Wade,

30:09.375 --> 30:11.143
you're stronger than me...
Why, thank you.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.145
It's not a compliment.
You're stronger than me,

30:13.179 --> 30:16.048
so you can't pull harder than me
or we could cause more damage.

30:16.082 --> 30:18.250
Ready?
On three. One,

30:18.284 --> 30:19.451
two, three.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.287
(bone cracks, Earl screams)
I'm sorry!

30:21.320 --> 30:23.856
I'm sorry. What now?
That's great!
You did great!

30:23.890 --> 30:25.291
Okay, uh, hand me that
newspaper. I'm gonna splint it.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.393
You go up to the street
and find the ambulance.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.262
It's gonna be okay.
Wade, go.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.497
He's gonna be okay. I promise.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.500
Be back.

30:34.533 --> 30:37.236
You'd better be okay.
I promised him.

30:40.372 --> 30:43.275
I stopped to pick up
some dinner. Hope you like...

30:43.309 --> 30:44.210
Unbelievable.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.511
What is going on here?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.079
Where's...
Your brand-new

30:47.113 --> 30:47.880
perfect daughter?

30:47.914 --> 30:49.615
The one
that you replaced me with?

30:49.648 --> 30:53.152
Oh, Magnolia,
you haven't been replaced.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.153
What would you call it, Dad?

30:54.186 --> 30:58.157
You banish me to live
with that grand-monster,

30:58.190 --> 31:00.226
then boarding
school, blowing off

31:00.259 --> 31:01.560
family dinner
because you finally found

31:01.593 --> 31:03.095
the daughter of your dreams.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.197
Someone who wants to
be a doctor, who...

31:05.231 --> 31:08.100
likes books and has no interest
in hair products.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.501
Yay for you, Dad.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.504
Now, come on. That is not
what is going on here.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.441
A-And, yes, it was nice
that someone paid some interest

31:15.474 --> 31:17.109
in my life's work, but...

31:17.143 --> 31:19.211
You know what?
Your life's work is stupid.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.046
Hey.
You could find

31:20.079 --> 31:21.680
better medical care
on the Internet.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.515
Good-bye.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.517
N... Magnolia...

31:25.551 --> 31:28.320
(sighs)
(door opens)

31:28.354 --> 31:30.289
(door shuts)
Is she gone?

31:31.323 --> 31:33.659
I'm sorry. I...

31:33.692 --> 31:35.361
You know Magnolia.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.564
She's always thinking she got
the short end of the stick.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.533
True, but on the other hand,

31:41.567 --> 31:43.402
she is only home for a night,

31:43.435 --> 31:46.538
and her dad is still at work
looking at old X rays, rather

31:46.572 --> 31:50.977
than having dinner with her,
so maybe this time...

31:53.179 --> 31:55.681
Wow! The room
looks perfect.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.516
Well, everything
was designed

31:57.549 --> 32:00.152
to be the most memorable moment
of A.B.'s life.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.553
Well, anything else
I need to know?

32:01.587 --> 32:04.223
Nope. Just be on time,
act natural,

32:04.256 --> 32:06.225
and don't look at the camera.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.260
I need
to capture authentic emotions.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.561
All right, we'll see
you in a half hour.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.164
(laughs)

32:12.198 --> 32:14.967
I just had a brainstorm about my
wedding, and I had to share it.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.702
You know what
the main course has to be?

32:16.735 --> 32:18.304
Uh, meatballs?

32:18.337 --> 32:20.372
Meatballs!
Exactly!

32:20.406 --> 32:22.975
Wow. It's like
you are in my brain.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.376
Wedding of the century, Lemon.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.245
Later!

32:26.278 --> 32:28.614
Aah!

32:28.647 --> 32:31.583
(sighs)
Are we not answering
our phone these days?

32:31.617 --> 32:33.285
Sorry, Grandma. I'm busy.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.586
Where's your sister?

32:34.620 --> 32:35.721
Magnolia's in town?

32:35.754 --> 32:38.424
Oh, we have almost no time

32:38.457 --> 32:41.193
to get your hair done,
pick out a wardrobe,

32:41.227 --> 32:43.729
and tone your arms if you expect
to get on that ship

32:43.762 --> 32:45.397
in four days.

32:45.431 --> 32:46.698
Well, in four days,

32:46.732 --> 32:49.301
these flabby arms
and untamed hair will be hosting

32:49.335 --> 32:50.702
three wedding-type events
right here,

32:50.736 --> 32:52.738
and that's not including
AnnaBeth's surprise engagement.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.640
So...
AnnaBeth?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.575
Well, doesn't it
give you pause to know

32:56.608 --> 32:57.776
that AnnaBeth, your good friend,

32:57.809 --> 32:59.578
is embarking
on her second marriage

32:59.611 --> 33:01.613
when your first
isn't even in sight?

33:01.647 --> 33:04.016
No pause, Grandma.
No pause at all!

33:04.050 --> 33:05.684
Oh! And did I hear right?

33:05.717 --> 33:08.720
Meatball, your very,
very secret shame,

33:08.754 --> 33:10.222
is also marrying?

33:10.256 --> 33:11.457
Still no pause!

33:11.490 --> 33:14.026
Oh, Lemon,
what is wrong with you?

33:14.060 --> 33:16.495
Why can't you get
out of your own way?

33:16.528 --> 33:19.465
Don't you want
a relationship?

33:19.498 --> 33:22.768
Sugar, there's a big hole
in your life,

33:22.801 --> 33:24.670
and you can try
to fill it up

33:24.703 --> 33:27.439
with busywork
and this restaurant

33:27.473 --> 33:29.741
and all the candles
in this state...

33:29.775 --> 33:31.343
Give me back that candle!

33:31.377 --> 33:32.644
Aah!

33:32.678 --> 33:34.446
I'm not going on that cruise,

33:34.480 --> 33:36.582
and I am not saying it again.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.487
Oh!

33:41.520 --> 33:43.455
LAVON:
All right, two games all.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.357
97-96 in the fifth.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.525
Match point.
I know

33:46.558 --> 33:47.659
it's match point.

33:47.693 --> 33:48.794
There's been, like,
60 match points.

33:48.827 --> 33:49.795
You don't have
to say match point

33:49.828 --> 33:51.430
every time it's match point.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.465
Now, do I say match point
whenever it's my match point?

33:53.499 --> 33:54.366
Got to win by two.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.768
I know!

33:56.802 --> 33:59.271
(sighs)
I feel like we've
been here for a week.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.673
I'm gonna need to sell a kidney
just to pay the babysitter.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.808
(grunting)

34:02.841 --> 34:04.276
Oh!
Game!

34:04.310 --> 34:05.277
No, no!
Set.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.079
No!
Match!

34:07.113 --> 34:08.347
Yeah.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.581
Ooh. Looks like
we have our answer.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.516
Oh, it's gonna be
one hell of a sign.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.618
Oh, Lavon.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.853
Look, I don't like it, but
he won fair and square.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.556
Good game, Gainey.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.759
Yeah. Good game, Gainey.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.362
I feel like
I should shake your hand, too.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.632
Well, nice to know
y'all can be such gracious...

34:26.665 --> 34:28.333
Uh, what's that word?

34:28.367 --> 34:29.635
Oh, yeah. Losers.

34:31.337 --> 34:32.838
Hey, mind
if I have my hand back?

34:32.871 --> 34:34.540
Not quite yet.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.442
Am I seeing
things, gentlemen,

34:36.475 --> 34:37.842
or is there
red paint under

34:37.876 --> 34:40.411
Mayor Gainey's
fingernails here?

34:40.446 --> 34:42.414
Paint that happens to match

34:42.447 --> 34:43.849
the red paint
up on his wrist.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.650
Virtually identical

34:45.684 --> 34:47.719
to the red spray paint
that was used

34:47.753 --> 34:50.522
to deface the highway sign
this very morning.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.724
Yeah, well, I tell you.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.327
I don't know what...
what you're implying here.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.895
I don't think
I was being particularly subtle.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.364
I think he's implying

34:58.397 --> 34:59.731
that you yourself
graffitied up that sign

34:59.765 --> 35:00.866
just so you'd
have an excuse

35:00.899 --> 35:02.868
to get a new one and
put Fillmore on top.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.372
What? These outrageous
accusations!

35:06.405 --> 35:07.673
Well,

35:07.706 --> 35:09.341
I mean, we
could just

35:09.375 --> 35:10.642
subpoena
the security cam footage

35:10.676 --> 35:12.644
from the rest area
across the street,

35:12.678 --> 35:14.580
you know, just to be sure.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.482
Mayor Gainey!

35:21.853 --> 35:24.490
(crying):
I just love my town so much.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.557
RILEY:
I, for one,

35:25.591 --> 35:26.792
am outraged!

35:26.825 --> 35:28.794
Which is kind of
a new feeling for me.

35:28.827 --> 35:32.498
Uh, Mayor Hayes,
you have top billing.

35:32.531 --> 35:36.602
Mayor Gainey,
drive me home.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.809
Security camera
in the rest area?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.377
(door closes)

35:45.411 --> 35:47.679
Ah, there's not
even a rest area.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.815
(both laugh)

35:51.817 --> 35:53.919
They say you're
gonna be all right.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.654
We got to it in time.

35:55.687 --> 35:56.755
You hear that, Dad?

35:56.788 --> 35:58.390
You get to keep your foot,

35:58.424 --> 35:59.525
thanks to this one.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.626
You did okay, too.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.194
You know,
it's kind of a shame.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.696
I had a nice peg leg
picked out for you, too.

36:04.730 --> 36:05.931
(laughs)

36:05.964 --> 36:07.833
I'm sorry I dragged
y'all out here.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.968
I'm an idiot.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.737
What's the point
of getting sober

36:11.770 --> 36:14.406
when you just fall
in your own booby trap?

36:14.440 --> 36:17.609
You really go four weeks
without a drink... for a girl?

36:17.643 --> 36:19.445
EARL:
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

36:19.478 --> 36:23.415
I'm too old to be making a fool
out of myself for love.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.817
Not at all. Zoe's right.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.554
Anything's possible.

36:30.456 --> 36:33.225
All right, forward
just a few more steps.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.427
Davis, where are we?

36:35.461 --> 36:36.528
Just a little bit more.
Okay. Oh.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.629
Right there.
Oh!

36:37.663 --> 36:38.830
All right, now,
sit back real slow.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.899
Oh, I don't
like this game.
Okay.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.205
Oh, my Lord. Oh.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.642
AnnaBeth Nass...

36:50.676 --> 36:52.544
Oh, my God.
...girl of my dreams...

36:52.578 --> 36:54.746
Never the bride.
Grandma, hush.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.283
...will you make me the happiest
man in the world and marry me?

36:58.884 --> 37:01.019
(camera shutter clicking)

37:01.052 --> 37:03.689
(flame pops)

37:03.722 --> 37:04.990
Oh, my God!

37:05.023 --> 37:06.992
(shrieks)
Oh, my God!

37:07.025 --> 37:09.461
(shrieking)
I know. I'm
excited, too.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.496
(alarm bell ringing)

37:10.529 --> 37:11.897
It's an inferno!
(shrieks)

37:11.930 --> 37:13.832
(shrieking and yelling)

37:13.865 --> 37:14.733
Oh!

37:14.766 --> 37:16.034
My restaurant.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.869
My hair!
DAVIS:
AnnaBeth?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.671
Yes?
What do you say?

37:19.705 --> 37:21.707
I say...

37:22.708 --> 37:24.710
Let's get out of this rain.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.012
(whimpers)
Oh, shoot!

37:27.045 --> 37:28.780
(alarm ringing)

37:37.923 --> 37:39.525
(door creaks open)

37:39.558 --> 37:41.560
How's your daughter, the doctor?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.796
Magnolia.

37:44.830 --> 37:48.900
I'm sorry I'm not
into medical things, okay?

37:48.934 --> 37:51.703
You don't have to be sorry.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.705
Good, because I'm not.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.041
You were right.

37:56.074 --> 37:59.711
I was enjoying showing
Rose what I do.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.781
We have things in common,
and-and she was...

38:02.814 --> 38:04.616
She was easier
to talk to than me.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.518
No. No.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.087
Maybe not as loud, but...

38:09.120 --> 38:11.623
You know, I just...

38:11.657 --> 38:13.024
I think you're loud sometimes

38:13.058 --> 38:15.627
because I wasn't
listening hard enough.

38:15.661 --> 38:18.063
It happens, I guess.

38:18.096 --> 38:21.667
Well, it doesn't
have to, which is why

38:21.700 --> 38:24.536
we are taking a two-week
vacation, an adventure.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.537
Just us. No cell phones,

38:25.571 --> 38:28.073
no computers, no
mobile devices...
What? No.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.842
Yeah, and you can
pick the destination.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.944
Now I'm interested.
(laughs)

38:32.978 --> 38:34.946
Can we go to Las Vegas?

38:34.980 --> 38:36.848
No.
Amsterdam?

38:36.882 --> 38:38.850
(phone ringing)

38:38.884 --> 38:40.552
Uh...

38:40.586 --> 38:42.688
Uh, yeah. Lemon.
Lemon, is everything...?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.556
What? A fire?

38:44.590 --> 38:45.991
At Fancie's?

38:46.024 --> 38:48.026
It wasn't me.
I was here all night.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.029
(garbled radio transmission,
indistinct shouting)

38:51.062 --> 38:54.099
LEMON:
Was supposed to have three
events here in the next week.

38:54.132 --> 38:57.135
Now it's not gonna be dry enough
to have a pool party.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.838
I told you your life
was going up in flames.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.673
Seems like
I had the right principle,

39:01.707 --> 39:02.841
but the wrong natural disaster.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.776
Lemon, are you okay?
Daddy.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.111
No.

39:06.144 --> 39:08.580
Oh, baby, it's
gonna be okay.

39:08.614 --> 39:09.915
Don't sugarcoat it
for her, Bertram.

39:09.948 --> 39:10.916
It is not!

39:10.949 --> 39:13.985
Mother, I know all of
these firemen by name,

39:14.019 --> 39:16.822
and I can have them remove
you from the premises.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.958
You still owe me
50 bucks.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.927
Oh!

39:23.862 --> 39:25.797
Hey.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.833
Hey. How's everything?

39:27.866 --> 39:30.736
Oh, I just got back
from the hospital.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.705
He's stable, already
complaining about the food.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.006
(laughs)
But, uh,

39:35.040 --> 39:37.609
they're going
to let him out in a day or two.

39:37.643 --> 39:40.011
That's great.
I am so relieved.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.948
Listen, I...

39:42.981 --> 39:46.017
I just wanted to thank you.

39:46.051 --> 39:49.855
You were right about...
pretty much everything.

39:51.857 --> 39:54.826
He's okay because of you.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.195
Well, I also got him
into this mess.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.897
Zoe.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.900
Okay, fine.
We can stick with I was right.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.869
I mean, I'm okay with that.
I can live with that.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.671
(laughing):
But...

40:06.805 --> 40:11.209
Hey, so... Brando
and Sylvie's wedding.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.645
Oh, my God.
No, if you want to--

40:13.679 --> 40:15.747
and no pressure at all--

40:15.781 --> 40:18.049
I would be willing
to do that reading with you,

40:18.083 --> 40:20.418
only because
it is so important to them.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.655
No, no, you're right.

40:23.689 --> 40:25.991
Oh, my God, it's still
such a bad idea.
No.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.459
It's not.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.695
I would like to do that reading.

40:30.896 --> 40:34.199
If I was going to the wedding,
but, uh, I'm not.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.968
Because Vivian might be there?

40:37.002 --> 40:39.137
No. Uh... it's work,

40:39.170 --> 40:40.806
actually.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.241
It's kind of a crazy thing
happened this morning.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.677
This-this investor lady came in,

40:45.711 --> 40:47.245
and, uh, she read
about the Rammer Jammer.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.947
She wants to franchise it.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.950
Open up another location,
maybe more.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.218
Are you kidding?

40:53.251 --> 40:55.053
Wade, that's amazing!

40:55.086 --> 40:57.222
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.990
Listen, I was gonna...

40:59.024 --> 41:01.226
I was gonna tell you,
but then Earl and...

41:01.259 --> 41:02.961
Oh, yeah.
Anyway, uh,

41:02.994 --> 41:04.095
I'm not gonna be at the wedding,

41:04.129 --> 41:05.964
'cause I'm gonna be
down in Atlanta.

41:05.997 --> 41:09.034
That's where the next
Rammer Jammer's going to be.

41:11.036 --> 41:14.005
So... you're moving?

41:16.041 --> 41:18.243
For how long?

41:18.276 --> 41:20.946
I don't know.

41:25.951 --> 41:29.120
I am so happy for you.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.757
Congratulations.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.261
Good night, Doc.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.564
Good night.
