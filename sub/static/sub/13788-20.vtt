WEBVTT

00:05.336 --> 00:08.179
Okay, Tyler,
keep an eye on Chloe.

00:08.179 --> 00:10.261
Your mom and I have
to go to a charity event

00:10.261 --> 00:11.302
for our date tonight.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.184
I still don't
understand why

00:13.184 --> 00:14.475
I'm not getting paid
to babysit Chloe.

00:14.475 --> 00:16.057
And I still
don't understand

00:16.057 --> 00:18.269
why men have
to go on dates
every Saturday night

00:18.269 --> 00:20.191
when they're tired
and already married.

00:21.232 --> 00:23.314
And why women have
to wear high heels

00:23.314 --> 00:25.316
when they're tall
and already married.

00:26.407 --> 00:29.700
Oh, hey.
Pod People from Pluto.

00:29.700 --> 00:32.243
That's a pretty
scary movie.
You're telling me.

00:32.243 --> 00:34.285
There's a big warning
right on the box.

00:34.285 --> 00:37.538
"Warning: do not reproduce
under penalty of law."

00:37.538 --> 00:39.460
It's so scary, you're not
allowed to have kids

00:39.460 --> 00:41.922
after watching it.
What would they be like?

00:43.334 --> 00:44.545
This movie
sounds great.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.716
I can't wait
to watch it.

00:45.716 --> 00:47.298
No, no, no,
Tyler can watch it,

00:47.298 --> 00:48.429
but you're too young.

00:48.429 --> 00:50.261
A movie like this
could scar you for life.

00:50.261 --> 00:51.882
How come Tyler gets
to be scarred for life?

00:51.882 --> 00:53.094
I want to be scarred.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.725
And I'm sure
someday you will be.

00:55.846 --> 00:57.228
Yes!

00:57.228 --> 01:00.181
♪ Scarred, scarred,
scarred for life! ♪

01:18.409 --> 01:20.501
Well, it's
Saturday night.

01:20.501 --> 01:24.044
My friends are out of town.
All my summer reading's done.

01:24.044 --> 01:27.298
Time to cut loose.
What crazy thing can I do?

01:27.298 --> 01:29.550
I know, I'll check
my spam folder!

01:31.212 --> 01:33.594
What? I've been
waiting for this.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.386
Why did you send this
to my spam folder?

01:35.386 --> 01:37.138
You know how important
this is to me!

01:37.138 --> 01:38.429
Easy there, Avery.

01:38.429 --> 01:40.391
People see you talking
to your computer,

01:40.391 --> 01:43.023
they'll think you have
a tenuous grasp of reality.

01:43.023 --> 01:44.725
So you want to tell your
talking dog what's up?

01:46.357 --> 01:49.320
Stan, I have been selected
to design a float

01:49.320 --> 01:50.991
for the Pasadena
Petal Parade.

01:50.991 --> 01:53.154
Whoa, that's
the second largest

01:53.154 --> 01:55.786
flower-based parade
in all of Pasadena.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.199
I know, and the floats
are seen

01:58.199 --> 02:01.001
by everyone in town.
It's an incredible honor.

02:01.001 --> 02:02.743
Well, I'm glad
they got one thing right.

02:02.743 --> 02:05.916
Did you know they passed over
Robert as the Grand Marshal?

02:05.916 --> 02:07.628
After all he's done
for this city.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.050
Get out of the car, Robert,
it's not gonna happen.

02:12.092 --> 02:17.308
Stan, I am the first
teenager in 25 years
selected to do a float.

02:17.308 --> 02:19.600
And you'll never guess
who the last one was.
Your dad.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.103
How'd you know?
I looked it up on my phone
while you were talking.

02:23.103 --> 02:25.436
By the by, according
to my weather app,

02:25.436 --> 02:28.439
it's gonna be 97 degrees
in New York tomorrow.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.941
It's just gonna smell
like hot garbage.

02:30.941 --> 02:32.273
Man, I wish I was there.

02:33.984 --> 02:36.697
Dad is gonna be so excited.

02:36.697 --> 02:39.280
You know, he's always doing
stuff with Tyler and Chloe,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.992
but I've never had a chance
to do a big project like this

02:41.992 --> 02:44.245
and really connect with him.
And I'm not even going to let

02:44.245 --> 02:47.418
the rest of the family help out,
so it can be our special thing.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.459
It's the reason
I applied for it.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.421
Avery, that's
really great.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.293
I'm so happy for you.

02:52.293 --> 02:53.924
Is that the right reaction?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.676
I'm sorry, all I could think
about the whole time

02:55.676 --> 02:57.598
you were talking
is hot garbage.

02:57.598 --> 02:59.890
Hot, hot garbage.

03:04.685 --> 03:08.269
( screaming )

03:08.269 --> 03:10.811
What are you doing?
Chloe, you're not supposed
to be watching this.

03:10.811 --> 03:13.404
Well, you are
a terrible babysitter.
You had three jobs.

03:13.404 --> 03:15.656
Don't let me
watch this movie,
make me go to bed,

03:15.656 --> 03:17.278
and keep me out
of Mommy's makeup.

03:17.278 --> 03:19.079
Well, you didn't
get into Mommy's makeup.

03:21.532 --> 03:22.953
You're a terrible babysitter!

03:24.375 --> 03:25.376
Get over here.

03:27.328 --> 03:29.330
You can't tell Mom and Dad
you saw this movie,

03:29.330 --> 03:30.961
or we'll both get in trouble.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.883
They'll be home soon.
Now get to bed right away.

03:32.883 --> 03:34.295
I can't.
I'm too scared.

03:34.295 --> 03:36.337
Just go get ready.
I'll be up to check

03:36.337 --> 03:37.758
under your bed
for pod people in a minute.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.760
There could be pod people
under my bed?

03:39.760 --> 03:41.432
Why would you say that?

03:41.432 --> 03:43.894
I didn't even know
they went under beds!

03:43.894 --> 03:45.976
I-I-I didn't mean
they're just under beds.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.730
They could be anywhere.
Anywhere? I'm anywhere!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.732
Scarred for life!
Scarred for life!

03:51.732 --> 03:53.944
( screaming )

03:53.944 --> 03:56.026
I'm gonna go
make sure she's okay.

03:56.026 --> 03:57.318
You should.

03:57.318 --> 03:59.360
But first,
what is my life about?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.662
A wise quacker.
What?

04:01.662 --> 04:04.244
Sorry, that's the answer
to a different question.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.417
Ask me "What's another
name for a clever duck?"

04:06.417 --> 04:09.249
( laughing )

04:09.249 --> 04:11.582
I'm serious.
That movie made me think.

04:11.582 --> 04:13.584
The hero's life
didn't have any meaning

04:13.584 --> 04:15.466
until he saved
the earth from destruction.

04:15.466 --> 04:18.178
I'd love to save the planet,
but I don't have the time.

04:18.178 --> 04:20.220
My hair alone takes
two to three hours a day.

04:21.382 --> 04:23.183
So what gives
my life meaning?

04:23.183 --> 04:25.556
My hair feels full,
but my life doesn't.

04:27.187 --> 04:29.019
Have you been shampooing
and conditioning

04:29.019 --> 04:30.391
your life regularly?

04:30.391 --> 04:32.232
'Cause that might
be the problem.

04:35.896 --> 04:38.198
Come on, director,
if you're gonna do a commentary,

04:38.198 --> 04:40.781
tell me what my life means!
I don't care that you made

04:40.781 --> 04:42.993
the alien brains
out of oatmeal and salsa!

04:42.993 --> 04:44.405
Okay, I do care,
'cause it was awesome

04:44.405 --> 04:46.407
and it sounds delicious,
but still.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.623
I have not felt this good
in a long time.

04:52.623 --> 04:54.375
Going to this charity event
and giving back

04:54.375 --> 04:55.966
really brings out
the best in you.

04:55.966 --> 04:58.048
I know, we're like
the nicest, kindest,

04:58.048 --> 05:01.972
most generous people
in all of Pasadena.
Eat that, Millers!

05:03.514 --> 05:05.886
I thought you guys were
dreading that charity thing.

05:05.886 --> 05:08.349
Yeah, we were,
but being there
makes you realize

05:08.349 --> 05:10.230
that life really is
about helping others.

05:10.230 --> 05:12.312
So that's what gives
meaning to your life?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.195
Yeah, Tyler,
we've been saying this
to you for years.

05:15.195 --> 05:17.438
But you didn't tell me
through the television,

05:17.438 --> 05:18.439
and that's how I learn.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.653
Man, that was a scary movie.

05:22.653 --> 05:24.945
I've got to find something
to get my mind off it.

05:24.945 --> 05:27.037
Goats! Perfect.

05:27.037 --> 05:28.869
I like goats.
Goats are friendly.

05:28.869 --> 05:29.910
( goat shrieking )

05:29.910 --> 05:31.211
( Stan screaming )

05:39.259 --> 05:40.761
The Pasadena Petal Parade?

05:40.761 --> 05:42.763
That's the second largest
flower-based parade

05:42.763 --> 05:44.054
in all of Pasadena.

05:45.305 --> 05:46.637
Your dad is
gonna be so happy

05:46.637 --> 05:48.268
you're doing this
just like he did

05:48.268 --> 05:50.310
when he was a teenager.
And we are going to have

05:50.310 --> 05:51.932
so much fun building it.
What's our theme?

05:51.932 --> 05:55.275
Well, my theme is
"Out of this World."

05:55.275 --> 05:56.977
My float is going
to be a spaceship

05:56.977 --> 05:58.439
based on the pod people movie.

05:58.439 --> 06:01.442
Your theme is
"Out of This Project,"

06:01.442 --> 06:04.074
based on the fact
that I really don't
want you involved.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.947
Your tone was so positive

06:06.947 --> 06:08.749
but what you said
was so negative.

06:08.749 --> 06:10.491
It's like being
slapped by a clown.

06:11.912 --> 06:13.253
Why don't you
want me involved?

06:13.253 --> 06:14.374
You know how you are.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.917
Yeah, of course,
I know how I am.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.839
Bennett, how am I?
Tell me now.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.262
Avery said to me,
"You know how you are."

06:22.262 --> 06:23.263
What do you think she meant?

06:24.595 --> 06:28.008
Do not hold your breath
and try to pass out on me.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.219
( exhales )

06:30.811 --> 06:32.142
Look, if you want
to know what she meant,

06:32.142 --> 06:33.353
why don't you just ask her?

06:33.353 --> 06:34.775
I don't want
to seem insecure.

06:34.775 --> 06:36.396
What if that's
what she meant?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
I'm not getting slapped
by that clown again.

06:43.073 --> 06:44.404
All I wanted to do
is help her

06:44.404 --> 06:46.286
with her float
in the Pasadena Petal Parade.

06:46.286 --> 06:48.489
She got it?
Oh, that is great.

06:48.489 --> 06:50.491
That is the second largest
flower-based parade

06:50.491 --> 06:51.832
in all of Pasadena.

06:52.993 --> 06:54.495
Hon, don't feel bad.

06:54.495 --> 06:56.707
Avery probably just wants
to do this by herself

06:56.707 --> 06:58.338
and she knows how you are.

06:58.338 --> 06:59.209
How am I?

07:01.211 --> 07:02.713
Bennett!

07:02.713 --> 07:04.214
( exhales )

07:05.425 --> 07:07.137
Listen, Avery isn't
gonna want us

07:07.137 --> 07:08.679
horning in
and taking over.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.261
We should just back off,
and let this be her thing.

07:11.261 --> 07:13.724
But can you, Bennett?
Can you?

07:13.724 --> 07:15.145
You know how you are.

07:15.145 --> 07:17.317
Yes, and I'm fine
with how I am.

07:17.317 --> 07:19.860
No, you're supposed
to be completely bothered
by my saying that.

07:19.860 --> 07:22.232
Sorry, I'm not.
That's not how I am.

07:22.232 --> 07:23.484
That's how you are.

07:27.618 --> 07:29.329
I'm so tired.

07:29.329 --> 07:30.661
I couldn't sleep
last night

07:30.661 --> 07:32.202
thinking about aliens
coming to earth

07:32.202 --> 07:33.704
to turn us
into pod people.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.376
Me, too.
Plus goats.

07:38.128 --> 07:40.340
I wish I could
ask Mommy and Daddy
about the movie,

07:40.340 --> 07:41.922
but they told me
not to watch it.

07:41.922 --> 07:44.044
They also told me not
to eat pie for dinner.

07:44.044 --> 07:45.465
I listened about the pie.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.427
I should have listened
about the movie.

07:47.427 --> 07:48.679
Also, I didn't listen
about the pie.

07:48.679 --> 07:49.680
My tummy hurts.

07:51.351 --> 07:53.263
Maybe it's a good thing
we saw the movie.

07:53.263 --> 07:56.807
Now if aliens come for real,
we'll know what to be
on the lookout for.

07:56.807 --> 08:00.230
Right. Like when someone
becomes a pod person,
their head gets bigger.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.272
I just don't know
about Avery, Bennett.

08:02.272 --> 08:03.363
Maybe it's not how I am.

08:03.363 --> 08:04.905
Maybe she's getting
a big head.

08:04.905 --> 08:05.986
( gasping )

08:08.198 --> 08:10.240
I mean, look at
this spaceship she
wants to build.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.572
It's very ambitious.

08:11.572 --> 08:12.573
( gasping )

08:14.204 --> 08:16.116
And the way she was
talking to me, Bennett,

08:16.116 --> 08:18.378
it's like she was
purposely trying
to alienate me.

08:18.378 --> 08:20.290
Alienate?
I bet that means

08:20.290 --> 08:21.582
to turn someone
into an alien.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.967
No, Mommy, don't let
Avery alienate you!

08:26.967 --> 08:28.929
Oh, honey, it's sweet
that you're concerned,

08:28.929 --> 08:30.931
but we would never
let that happen.

08:30.931 --> 08:32.302
Not in my house!

08:33.473 --> 08:34.725
I've always wanted
to say that.

08:35.726 --> 08:37.728
Now that you have?
Meh!

08:37.728 --> 08:39.229
Ah! Goat!

08:40.901 --> 08:42.272
What are you
going to do about Avery?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.984
You can't
let her be this way.

08:43.984 --> 08:45.235
You may not have noticed

08:45.235 --> 08:46.697
because of the way
you idolize her,

08:46.697 --> 08:49.359
but Avery has always
been this way.

08:51.652 --> 08:54.494
Avery's been an alien
this whole time.

08:54.494 --> 08:56.286
She just looks
like a human.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.158
That's what pod people are!

08:58.158 --> 09:00.661
All her strange behavior
suddenly makes sense.

09:09.630 --> 09:12.012
And she has a talking dog!

09:12.012 --> 09:13.263
All the signs were there!

09:14.344 --> 09:16.266
We've got to do something

09:16.266 --> 09:18.058
before she alienates
the whole family,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.389
turns everybody
into pod people,

09:19.389 --> 09:22.232
and destroys the earth
with her spaceship!

09:22.232 --> 09:24.274
I just don't know
how she's going
to have time

09:24.274 --> 09:28.238
to build that spaceship
and also do that float
for the parade.

09:28.238 --> 09:30.901
Aliens be multitasking.

09:33.033 --> 09:34.825
DOLL:
Feed me, feed me.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.747
Where is that coming from?

09:36.747 --> 09:39.459
Feed me. Feed me.

09:39.459 --> 09:41.041
Would you be quiet?

09:42.252 --> 09:44.625
Maybe I should come
back another time.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.336
No, no, sweetie,
this is fine.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.168
I just need
to turn this off.

09:48.168 --> 09:51.551
Feed me.
Or maybe
I'll just feed her.

09:51.551 --> 09:53.804
So I have
some big news.

09:53.804 --> 09:55.425
I know.
Your mom told me.

09:55.425 --> 09:58.679
The Pasadena Petal Parade.
Congratulations.

09:58.679 --> 10:00.180
Well, the thing is--

10:00.180 --> 10:02.853
Burp me.
Sorry, Avery. Go on.

10:04.815 --> 10:07.567
So I'm not even gonna let
Mom and Tyler help out,

10:07.567 --> 10:08.819
and I came in here
to ask you--

10:08.819 --> 10:11.321
To stay out of it, too.
I get it.

10:11.321 --> 10:12.322
( baby burps )

10:12.322 --> 10:14.234
Oh, good girl.

10:15.535 --> 10:17.237
Look, Avery,
you and I know that

10:17.237 --> 10:18.448
I'm the one who's
done this before.

10:18.448 --> 10:20.791
And I would just come in
with all my ideas

10:20.791 --> 10:22.873
and then this wouldn't be
your thing anymore.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.084
Well, I just
thought that--

10:24.084 --> 10:25.666
I should stay
out of it.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.548
I'm okay with that,
and I am so proud of you

10:28.548 --> 10:30.050
for doing this without me.

10:30.050 --> 10:32.052
You are going to make
an amazing float.

10:32.052 --> 10:33.253
I can't wait to see it.

10:33.253 --> 10:35.095
Oh. Yeah.

10:35.095 --> 10:37.427
Because that's
the whole reason
I applied for it.

10:37.427 --> 10:40.470
To make an amazing float
without you.

10:40.470 --> 10:43.393
DOLL: Change me.
Ellen!

10:43.393 --> 10:45.605
ELLEN: I am not changing
your doll again!

10:51.481 --> 10:55.115
So, how was your first day
making your float?

10:55.115 --> 10:57.237
Not to pry,
just idle curiosity.

10:57.237 --> 10:59.950
'Cause that's how I am.
Idle and curious.

11:01.201 --> 11:02.622
Oh, I wonder where
these are made.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.455
The float's
not going well, Mom.

11:05.455 --> 11:06.707
You've got to help me.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.248
My friends are all out of town,

11:08.248 --> 11:10.670
and the person I was planning
on having help me...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.552
doesn't want to.
Well, I'm a little hurt

11:12.552 --> 11:14.134
that I'm not your first choice.

11:14.134 --> 11:15.886
Is that how I am?
Easily hurt?

11:15.886 --> 11:18.558
Because I think
of myself as having
a very thick skin.

11:18.558 --> 11:20.260
Don't you?

11:21.852 --> 11:24.684
Of course. Of course,
your skin is so thick.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.356
You're like
a hippopotamus.

11:27.357 --> 11:28.518
Thank you, Avery.

11:28.518 --> 11:29.900
I am a thick hippo,
aren't I?

11:31.571 --> 11:34.735
It's just I need
this float to be amazing.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.737
I really want Dad
to be proud of me.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.489
I want everyone
in town to be proud.

11:39.489 --> 11:41.321
Even the guy
in the bunny suit

11:41.321 --> 11:43.283
who spins the sign
outside the copy place.

11:43.283 --> 11:45.085
Why do I care
what he thinks?

11:45.085 --> 11:47.167
And what do bunnies have
to do with making copies?

11:47.167 --> 11:49.669
Oh, wait, I just got it.

11:49.669 --> 11:51.171
Well played, Donny.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.674
So will you help me
build my spaceship?

11:56.256 --> 12:00.340
Oh, I have no power to resist
that hug, Avery. I'm in.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.392
( gasp )

12:02.392 --> 12:04.604
Thanks, Mom.
I feel like together,

12:04.604 --> 12:06.516
we can conquer
the whole world.

12:09.189 --> 12:11.772
That's how she turns her
victims into pod people.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.354
Special hugs.

12:14.354 --> 12:17.157
It's just like the alien
mind meld from the movie.

12:17.157 --> 12:19.199
From now on, we can't
let anyone hug us.

12:19.199 --> 12:22.362
But how? We're the two
most huggable ones
in this whole house.

12:22.362 --> 12:24.034
Maybe in all of Pasadena.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.917
Chloe, you're so tired,
you're not making any sense.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.419
We're the most huggable ones
in the whole world.

12:34.374 --> 12:35.335
Hey, Dad, so you're
still in a good mood

12:35.335 --> 12:36.636
about that
charity thing, huh?

12:36.636 --> 12:37.968
Actually, I am, Tyler.

12:37.968 --> 12:39.509
That, and this apple
is promising

12:39.509 --> 12:41.842
to be really firm,
but juicy.

12:41.842 --> 12:44.184
When you hear that noise
when I cut it,

12:44.184 --> 12:46.847
yup, everything
is coming up Bennett.

12:48.148 --> 12:49.559
I was trying to do
that thing you said

12:49.559 --> 12:51.521
to give my life meaning
by helping people.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.813
I saw a bunch
of nerds at the mall

12:52.813 --> 12:54.064
and said, "Hey, nerds,

12:54.064 --> 12:55.655
get over here.
I'm gonna fix you."

12:56.987 --> 12:58.658
They just scattered
like roaches

12:58.658 --> 13:00.200
and ran into
a comic book store,

13:00.200 --> 13:02.282
so I couldn't follow.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.324
That doesn't sound like
they wanted to be helped.

13:05.325 --> 13:07.577
Oh. Yeah.

13:07.577 --> 13:10.040
Try finding someone
who really needs your help.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.212
But where am I gonna
find someone like that?

13:12.212 --> 13:13.874
Tyler, I really
need your help.

13:13.874 --> 13:17.217
Not a chance!
Sorry, reflex.

13:17.217 --> 13:18.258
I meant to say,
"Never happening."

13:18.258 --> 13:19.589
Why do I keep doing that?

13:20.881 --> 13:22.262
Will you help Mom and me

13:22.262 --> 13:24.014
decorate my float
for the parade?

13:24.014 --> 13:26.226
Sure, I'd love to.
Man, that felt weird.

13:27.477 --> 13:29.019
Thank you, Tyler.

13:29.019 --> 13:31.101
Not the hug,
Tyler! Don't!

13:31.101 --> 13:32.853
Here, I'll show
you the plans.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.605
Oh, no. Tyler's
become a pod person.

13:35.605 --> 13:39.279
But why would an advanced
alien race want Tyler?

13:39.279 --> 13:41.241
Maybe to plant him
on a hair farm

13:41.241 --> 13:43.033
to grow themselves wigs.

13:43.033 --> 13:45.445
Yes, that's it.
I don't need sleep to come

13:45.445 --> 13:47.707
to that brilliantly
logical conclusion!

13:51.581 --> 13:54.504
Daddy, Tyler and Mommy
have joined Avery.

13:54.504 --> 13:57.087
And we're
the only ones left.
You have to help.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.920
Well, I wish I could,
but I have to stay out of it.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.221
Why?
DOLL: Feed me.

14:01.221 --> 14:03.423
Ignore that.

14:03.423 --> 14:05.926
Honey, you may be too young
to understand this,

14:05.926 --> 14:08.308
but if I try to help,
it'll only make
things worse.

14:08.308 --> 14:09.769
But you go on
and do what you can.

14:09.769 --> 14:12.392
Okay, I'll go
save the world.

14:12.392 --> 14:14.104
I'll do it
for you, Daddy.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.815
Oh, that is so cute.

14:15.815 --> 14:17.607
Yeah, you go on,
save the world for Daddy.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.482
So it's up to us, Stan.
We've got to stop Avery

14:22.482 --> 14:25.245
and free Tyler and Mommy
from being pod people.

14:25.245 --> 14:26.576
We better do it
before they plant you

14:26.576 --> 14:28.288
in one of their
hair farms.

14:28.288 --> 14:30.160
Plant me? What do
you mean plant me?

14:30.160 --> 14:32.122
Nothing, nothing.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.295
You have nothing
to worry about.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.502
Okay, the parade
is tomorrow,

14:42.502 --> 14:44.424
so we have less
than 24 hours

14:44.424 --> 14:46.386
to finish decorating.
These coveralls

14:46.386 --> 14:48.138
are partly to protect
your clothes,

14:48.138 --> 14:49.769
but mainly
because studies show

14:49.769 --> 14:51.311
when workers
are dressed alike,

14:51.311 --> 14:53.683
they follow their leader
blindly--gladly.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.147
I really need this
float to be great

14:57.147 --> 14:58.728
so thank you both
so much for helping.

14:58.728 --> 15:01.321
Well, you know
how I am. Helpful.

15:01.321 --> 15:03.363
That is how I am, right?
You don't have to say it.

15:03.363 --> 15:05.235
I know it is,
I know it is.

15:05.235 --> 15:06.786
Hey, I'm happy
to help because

15:06.786 --> 15:08.368
it's going to give
my life meaning.

15:08.368 --> 15:09.869
So far, it's only
given my life boredom

15:09.869 --> 15:11.241
and frustration,
but I'm hoping

15:11.241 --> 15:13.203
that meaning part
is coming right up

15:13.203 --> 15:15.415
behind it like
the dessert part
of a healthy meal.

15:17.587 --> 15:18.588
Good luck with that.

15:21.751 --> 15:24.174
All right, Stan.
Are you ready

15:24.174 --> 15:25.385
to go undercover
in these spacesuits,

15:25.385 --> 15:26.676
so we can stop
their evil plan?

15:28.678 --> 15:31.761
I'm totally down
for stopping their evil plan,

15:31.761 --> 15:33.603
but then can we still
keep these spacesuits?

15:33.603 --> 15:36.436
They are super-comfy.
Almost like coveralls.

15:38.558 --> 15:40.400
( gasp )
Oh, no.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.612
They're just like
the pod people from the movie.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.407
Almost done, Mom?
Getting there.

15:47.407 --> 15:50.200
Okay, either we're
really tired 'cause
we're freaked out

15:50.200 --> 15:52.572
and haven't slept
in two days and we're
seeing things,

15:52.572 --> 15:55.205
or they all have
giant alien heads.

15:55.205 --> 15:58.168
Giant alien heads does
make the most sense.

15:58.168 --> 15:59.419
That's what
I was thinking!

16:01.171 --> 16:03.883
I know we can make this
the best spaceship ever,

16:03.883 --> 16:07.047
then march it through the town
and blow everyone away.

16:07.047 --> 16:08.468
Yeah!

16:11.681 --> 16:13.473
Tyler, it is so nice
that you are helping

16:13.473 --> 16:14.934
your sister with this.

16:14.934 --> 16:16.646
But I'm not feeling
good about it yet.

16:16.646 --> 16:18.148
I'm still not getting
the dessert part

16:18.148 --> 16:20.940
of the healthy meal.
Where's my pudding?

16:20.940 --> 16:22.362
Where's my feel-good pudding?

16:24.154 --> 16:25.735
I thought you liked
healthy food.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.238
Not as much as
feel-good pudding, Mom.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.659
Not nearly as much.

16:32.372 --> 16:35.705
I think we're going
to finish on time, Mom.
I really owe you.

16:35.705 --> 16:38.078
You can repay me
by telling me how I am.

16:38.078 --> 16:39.829
You're somebody who
latches on to something

16:39.829 --> 16:41.251
somebody says
and won't let it go.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.922
No, that doesn't
sound like me.

16:44.464 --> 16:46.256
Okay, Mom.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.968
The only reason I said that
is because I really wanted

16:48.968 --> 16:50.340
Dad to help me with this
instead of you,

16:50.340 --> 16:52.262
and I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.223
You didn't want
to hurt my feelings

16:53.223 --> 16:54.974
and yet you're
telling me this?

16:54.974 --> 16:57.767
You know how I am!

16:57.767 --> 17:00.850
But you and I have gotten to do
so many great things together.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.403
I've never done anything
like this with Dad.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.275
I really wanted to share
something special with him.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.237
Oh, sweetie.
You know what?

17:07.237 --> 17:08.948
I'm gonna call your dad
right now and--

17:08.948 --> 17:10.240
No, no, no. Don't.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.412
You should have seen
how proud he was of me

17:12.412 --> 17:13.453
doing this
without his help.

17:13.453 --> 17:15.155
And he's going
to be even prouder

17:15.155 --> 17:17.827
when he sees how great
the float turns out.

17:17.827 --> 17:19.419
Please don't mess
that up for me.

17:19.419 --> 17:20.830
Okay, I won't.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.163
And maybe next year,
we can have a turn bonding

17:23.163 --> 17:26.005
when you try something
I did when I was your age,

17:26.005 --> 17:28.128
Irish step dancing.

17:28.128 --> 17:31.010
Until I was kicked
out for trash talk.
"You're dancing like

17:31.010 --> 17:33.343
you've got Blarney stones
in your ghillies."

17:33.343 --> 17:35.555
Trust me,
that's really mean.

17:42.392 --> 17:44.234
We've been spying
on them for hours,

17:44.234 --> 17:46.446
and I still
don't know how we're
gonna stop them.

17:46.446 --> 17:48.398
And look, the ship
is almost done.

17:52.452 --> 17:54.574
Boy, I am so sleepy.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.406
Is there any chance
that's affecting the way

17:56.406 --> 17:59.199
we're seeing all this?
No, how could it be?

17:59.199 --> 18:01.201
A dog and a 7-year-old girl
are trying to stop aliens

18:01.201 --> 18:03.833
from taking over the planet.
Everything's normal.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.049
We did it.
Oh, we pulled it off.

18:10.049 --> 18:12.132
Thank you guys so much.
Oh, Avery,

18:12.132 --> 18:13.213
I could not be more pleased.

18:13.213 --> 18:14.884
I'm so happy I could dance.

18:18.478 --> 18:20.059
It's fun. You'll see,
you'll see.

18:20.059 --> 18:22.482
When you do it next year,
you'll see.

18:22.482 --> 18:26.226
You know, Avery, seeing you
this happy makes me feel...

18:26.226 --> 18:27.687
Wow, happy.

18:27.687 --> 18:29.689
There's the
feel-good pudding!

18:29.689 --> 18:31.531
My life has meaning.
Thank you.

18:31.531 --> 18:33.403
I never have to help
anyone ever again.

18:34.904 --> 18:36.156
Wait, Tyler, that's
not the way it--

18:36.156 --> 18:38.368
Mom, let the boy
have his pudding.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.291
So, you ready to climb
behind the wheel?

18:42.792 --> 18:44.123
Rev that engine,
and we'll drive it

18:44.123 --> 18:45.665
right out to
the staging area.

18:45.665 --> 18:47.457
( engine revving )

18:47.457 --> 18:50.420
ELLEN: It's not moving.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.591
Give it more gas.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.634
I'm giving her
all she's got, Captain.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.137
I don't know if the engines
can take any more.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.520
Trekkie one, Ellen.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.222
And I think
it's too heavy.

19:02.222 --> 19:03.563
No, no, it can't be.

19:05.265 --> 19:07.817
Oh, no. I-I-I
didn't account

19:07.817 --> 19:09.229
for the weight
of the flowers.

19:09.229 --> 19:10.940
How could I have
been so stupid?

19:10.940 --> 19:14.484
I'm gonna be humiliated
in front of the whole town.

19:14.484 --> 19:16.406
And Dad won't be...

19:17.577 --> 19:19.239
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.

19:19.239 --> 19:21.080
We'll just take
some of the flowers off.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.243
We have to take off
too many.

19:23.243 --> 19:25.375
There's no time.
I totally failed.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.166
I brought muffins.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.499
Not getting involved.
Letting Avery do her thing.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.461
Wow!

19:31.461 --> 19:33.253
Just wanted
to show my support.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.136
Nobody wants muffins?
I could get croissants.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.470
It doesn't move.
It's too heavy.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.352
I totally messed it up.

19:42.352 --> 19:47.186
If it's any consolation,
I still feel pretty good.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.608
Mmm. Yeah.

19:48.608 --> 19:51.571
Everything's
coming up Tyler.

19:56.276 --> 20:00.620
Avery, hon, this is still
quite an accomplishment.

20:00.620 --> 20:03.583
It looks amazing.
Don't lose sight
of why you did this.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.375
I...

20:05.375 --> 20:07.377
I did it to bond with you.

20:07.377 --> 20:09.289
And that never even happened.

20:09.289 --> 20:11.961
This whole thing has been
a disaster from start to finish.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.384
You did this
to bond with me?

20:15.385 --> 20:17.387
Yeah, I do stuff
with Mom,

20:17.387 --> 20:19.719
you do stuff
with Tyler and Chloe.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.601
I thought we could
do this together.

20:21.601 --> 20:23.222
Oh, my gosh, Avery.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.764
Why didn't you
say something?

20:24.764 --> 20:27.437
I tried, but you told me
how proud you were

20:27.437 --> 20:28.768
I was doing it
without you.

20:28.768 --> 20:30.480
And then that baby
belched like a trucker.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.524
Look, the only reason
I didn't want to
do this with you

20:34.524 --> 20:36.276
is because I didn't
want to take over.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.157
I didn't want...

20:38.157 --> 20:39.409
What?

20:39.409 --> 20:42.322
To be like my dad.

20:42.322 --> 20:45.575
Okay, when I did my float,
my dad swooped in
and took over.

20:45.575 --> 20:47.667
I mean, I got all kinds
of praise for it,

20:47.667 --> 20:51.961
but I did nothing, hon.
And that made me
feel horrible.

20:51.961 --> 20:54.794
I just wanted
to make sure I didn't do
the same thing to you.

20:54.794 --> 20:56.215
But you wouldn't have.

20:57.337 --> 20:58.468
We would have
done it together.

20:59.679 --> 21:01.681
Well, I guess
I messed up, too.

21:01.681 --> 21:03.473
I'm sorry.

21:03.473 --> 21:07.016
Maybe it's not too late.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.390
Maybe we can fix both
our mistakes together, huh?

21:10.390 --> 21:11.851
Let's see these plans.

21:20.109 --> 21:22.322
Okay, it's rigged
and ready to go.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.454
I rewired it so the motor
will overload

21:24.454 --> 21:25.905
and blow
the whole spaceship.

21:25.905 --> 21:27.246
How do you know
how to do that?

21:27.246 --> 21:28.458
Let's just say
I know a thing or two

21:28.458 --> 21:29.829
from scuttling
the spaceship

21:29.829 --> 21:32.081
I flew here in
from the talking dog planet.

21:32.081 --> 21:33.673
What?
No, I'm just kidding.

21:33.673 --> 21:35.294
I'm a normal
talking earth dog.

21:36.676 --> 21:38.007
( engine explodes )

21:42.221 --> 21:46.305
What happened?
I don't know, but it
removed a lot of flowers.

21:47.226 --> 21:49.809
Hey, maybe the float
will move now.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.061
But it's a mess
and the engine's blown.

21:52.061 --> 21:55.234
I bet if the two of us
work together,

21:55.234 --> 21:57.437
we can fix it.

21:57.437 --> 21:59.399
Well, it'll be fun
to try with you.

22:02.281 --> 22:04.283
We destroyed
the spaceship!

22:04.283 --> 22:06.366
We saved the world!

22:06.366 --> 22:07.367
I need a nap.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.578
Me, too.

22:12.872 --> 22:15.044
After Chloe and I
saved the world,

22:15.044 --> 22:17.256
a big parade
was thrown in our honor

22:17.256 --> 22:20.259
as we rode the destroyed
spacecraft through town.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.554
Avery and Bennett seemed
happy about something.

22:24.554 --> 22:26.556
Tyler kept
feeling good about his life

22:26.556 --> 22:29.268
and his muffin.

22:29.268 --> 22:31.641
And Ellen,
well, you know how she is.
