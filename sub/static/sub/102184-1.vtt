M_I_SForEver

01:59.219 --> 02:00.855
I am a man.

02:01.589 --> 02:02.991
I am a survivor.

02:04.191 --> 02:05.793
And I'm alone.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.196
Sun after moon...

02:09.530 --> 02:11.298
and moon after sun.

02:13.034 --> 02:15.235
Life is no longer what it used
to be.

02:17.038 --> 02:18.973
Only nature brings me life...

02:20.074 --> 02:21.542
a new life.

02:22.744 --> 02:26.313
Without it I'm lost.

02:29.083 --> 02:32.086
We are men and women.

02:33.588 --> 02:36.557
Now, woman is the hunter.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.028
And man is the hunted.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.263
I am the hunted.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.366
And I am...

02:46.668 --> 02:47.835
Noland.

05:46.981 --> 05:47.648
Don't touch her!

05:48.649 --> 05:49.317
Get away from her!

07:23.544 --> 07:24.845
Quiet.

07:26.714 --> 07:27.381
Come on!

07:34.989 --> 07:36.090
Where are you beauty!?

07:38.526 --> 07:41.529
No, no, no.

07:46.067 --> 07:47.535
There she is! Take her!

07:47.868 --> 07:48.636
You bitch!

12:13.400 --> 12:16.403
The trees they know, the moon
is watching us.

12:21.543 --> 12:23.143
Who are you?

12:26.013 --> 12:27.348
What do you want from me?

12:37.458 --> 12:38.727
I said...

12:39.193 --> 12:39.860
who are you...

12:41.262 --> 12:42.863
and what do you want from me?

12:48.335 --> 12:51.772
Who are you? And what do you
want from me?

12:54.576 --> 12:55.744
I am Noland.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.480
And I don't want anything from
you.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.100
You can call me Jack.

13:22.403 --> 13:24.872
What are you doing here Jack?

13:26.741 --> 13:27.676
Hiding.

13:28.743 --> 13:31.546
And you? Where are you going?

13:32.212 --> 13:32.913
Up north.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.883
The white beach.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.285
Where are you going?

13:41.723 --> 13:42.423
Jack?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.260
Everywhere and nowhere.

13:47.361 --> 13:49.631
Where women can't find me.

13:50.799 --> 13:53.133
But, come with me!?

14:01.241 --> 14:03.077
I got to go now.

14:04.445 --> 14:08.415
Good luck Noland. Good luck.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.093
Die! Die!

19:36.911 --> 19:38.378
You have no right!

19:40.615 --> 19:42.583
Just because I'm a man!

19:43.951 --> 19:45.318
You have no right.

19:54.529 --> 19:55.863
The war is over!

21:14.675 --> 21:16.110
The war has just begun.

21:16.544 --> 21:17.277
Tie him up!

21:54.048 --> 21:54.882
Stop it!

21:59.120 --> 21:59.887
You wanna fight?

23:05.653 --> 23:07.454
Stop!

23:09.991 --> 23:10.658
Come.

23:21.035 --> 23:22.270
No man will survive.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.140
No man will breathe.

23:27.742 --> 23:32.980
No man will ever be safe as long
as we are here on this earth.

23:35.950 --> 23:39.987
We will capture, torture and
kill

23:40.221 --> 23:43.391
every one of those disgusting
pigs.

23:47.595 --> 23:50.364
Because they are evil.

23:51.299 --> 23:54.302
And evil must die.

23:56.469 --> 24:00.374
We will fight for every woman
who has ever lived on this earth.

24:01.108 --> 24:06.147
And we will rule this planet once
and for all, for all eternity.

24:09.350 --> 24:10.318
Now...

24:11.185 --> 24:13.654
are you ready to kill some men!?

24:13.688 --> 24:14.655
Yeah!

24:14.689 --> 24:17.358
Are you ready to slaughter some
pigs!?

24:17.391 --> 24:19.093
Yeah!!

24:20.628 --> 24:21.696
Good.

24:23.030 --> 24:24.598
Then let us pray.

24:34.075 --> 24:35.743
We are strong.

24:37.712 --> 24:39.313
We are superior.

24:40.047 --> 24:43.050
We are the only gender strong
enough to rule this earth.

24:44.185 --> 24:47.188
Because we are women!

24:49.590 --> 24:51.225
We'll never give up.

24:51.959 --> 24:56.263
And we will rule this planet
once and for all!

25:05.172 --> 25:08.175
Now, practice.

26:01.195 --> 26:02.663
You stay here.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.199
Everyone! Let's go! Now!

28:49.664 --> 28:52.667
I will kill you if you move.

28:53.434 --> 28:54.902
Pig!

29:13.622 --> 29:14.522
Boo!

29:14.723 --> 29:15.789
Hahaha!

31:19.748 --> 31:21.181
Get the weapons.

31:21.616 --> 31:24.385
Get the weapons! I want him dead
or alive!

31:24.786 --> 31:25.587
Get them now!

34:42.215 --> 34:43.116
This way.

34:45.753 --> 34:46.420
No.

34:53.594 --> 34:55.362
This way.

40:38.005 --> 40:39.206
Hey pig!

45:31.799 --> 45:33.300
Noland?

45:37.905 --> 45:39.373
Noland.

45:56.625 --> 45:58.693
It will be alright.

45:59.661 --> 46:00.961
I see a child...

46:02.229 --> 46:03.998
smiling and playing.

46:05.966 --> 46:07.067
I see a woman...

46:08.570 --> 46:12.072
pregnant. And she's happy.

46:12.707 --> 46:14.408
So happy.

46:16.043 --> 46:17.712
The boy looks just like you.

46:18.479 --> 46:20.214
And he's free.

46:20.781 --> 46:22.216
Freedom Noland.

46:22.550 --> 46:23.817
Freedom.

46:25.152 --> 46:26.954
I see love and peace.

46:30.858 --> 46:32.393
Peace and love.

46:35.329 --> 46:37.398
Love and peace Noland.

46:37.732 --> 46:39.833
Love and peace.

55:34.735 --> 55:35.970
Hey.

56:33.426 --> 56:36.130
The ego of human beings must be
restrained

56:36.429 --> 56:39.432
before the world and humanity
can become one.

56:40.101 --> 56:41.936
Grow freely and peacefully.

56:42.637 --> 56:46.473
The ego is the only thing that can
destroy the world and all good within.

56:48.441 --> 56:51.312
Only when love for our souls has
been achieved,

56:51.679 --> 56:53.748
then everything else will shine.

56:54.682 --> 56:59.053
Peace will finally rise and
spread the light across the earth.

57:00.621 --> 57:02.890
You were here, and now you're
gone.

57:04.225 --> 57:07.228
We thank you for your time and for
all that you did for the world.

57:09.130 --> 57:12.133
We know you're in a better place
or will be soon.

57:12.600 --> 57:15.603
A place where love and peace
exist.

57:16.737 --> 57:20.641
Where man and woman are one.

01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:10.090
Tom and Lisa.

01:03:12.926 --> 01:03:15.929
How are you doing?
I've missed you.

01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:18.332
Yeah.

01:03:21.035 --> 01:03:24.038
Makes me glad to hear.
I'm a happy man.

01:03:32.647 --> 01:03:33.814
Tom?

01:03:34.148 --> 01:03:35.717
How are you doing in school?

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.754
You are? Good.

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:46.628
Is biology still your favorite
subject?

01:03:47.529 --> 01:03:48.362
No?

01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:49.664
English!?

01:03:52.199 --> 01:03:56.003
Well.. maybe you're gonna be the
next big writer?

01:03:58.005 --> 01:03:58.839
Yeah.

01:04:00.542 --> 01:04:06.815
You know... math was my favorite subject.
But I wasn't any good at it.

01:04:10.518 --> 01:04:12.086
But I never gave up.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.987
You should never give up.

01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:16.825
Yeah.

01:04:18.727 --> 01:04:19.860
And Lisa?

01:04:20.528 --> 01:04:22.062
How are your flowers doing?

01:04:23.565 --> 01:04:24.398
Good.

01:04:25.834 --> 01:04:27.034
I can smell them.

01:04:28.402 --> 01:04:29.303
Yeah.

01:04:29.336 --> 01:04:30.739
They are so beautiful.

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:36.711
Maybe we can take a walk in the
garden someday?

01:04:38.513 --> 01:04:39.413
Yeah.

01:04:39.446 --> 01:04:41.115
I would love that too.

01:04:42.684 --> 01:04:43.384
Yeah.

01:04:45.185 --> 01:04:49.089
You know... it didn't turn out
the way we wanted.

01:04:55.295 --> 01:04:57.532
Yeah I know.

01:05:02.871 --> 01:05:08.075
I'm gonna build a house by the
sea. Just as we planned.

01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:13.147
Yeah, a big garden too. Yeah.

01:05:18.485 --> 01:05:19.386
I love you.

01:05:21.054 --> 01:05:23.223
I love you. Love you too.

01:05:24.358 --> 01:05:29.997
And Tom? Take care of your mom.
Okay?

01:05:32.399 --> 01:05:34.401
Yeah. I love you.

01:05:35.737 --> 01:05:37.672
See you. See you soon.

01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:56.770
Love... is the answer.

01:08:59.171 --> 01:09:02.175
Where love exists,

01:09:08.515 --> 01:09:10.551
peace will follow...

01:09:11.085 --> 01:09:15.089
between woman and man.

01:09:21.328 --> 01:09:23.031
Find...

01:09:23.064 --> 01:09:24.899
find love.

01:09:25.633 --> 01:09:28.636
Find, find peace.

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:33.240
Unite.

01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:36.044
Unite.

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:40.346
Unite.

01:17:43.097 --> 01:17:44.698
Ah shit.

01:18:29.843 --> 01:18:31.946
Coward!

01:18:34.949 --> 01:18:36.784
Fight me!

01:19:53.427 --> 01:19:55.396
You'd better be prepared to die,

01:19:56.564 --> 01:19:57.965
pig!

01:19:59.099 --> 01:20:01.802
The future doesn't belong to you
anymore!

01:20:02.936 --> 01:20:06.440
I will create a whole new world.

01:20:07.107 --> 01:20:09.443
A world that you've never seen
before.

01:20:10.344 --> 01:20:14.649
A world ruled only by women.

01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:21.455
So all you can do now, man!

01:20:23.591 --> 01:20:24.592
Is die.

01:20:25.426 --> 01:20:26.894
Die!

01:20:27.729 --> 01:20:29.731
Die! Die!

01:21:05.667 --> 01:21:08.670
Haha!

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:38.600
Go and build your world around
you!

01:21:38.867 --> 01:21:40.200
Do what you have to do.

01:21:40.434 --> 01:21:43.437
But what will become of the
world is not up to us!

01:21:45.072 --> 01:21:48.409
The good will always win and
love shall always prevail.

01:21:50.144 --> 01:21:53.013
And the world will finally
become one.

01:21:53.648 --> 01:21:55.282
Now, you remember this!

01:21:55.817 --> 01:21:59.319
Now you remember this! Woman!

01:22:03.858 --> 01:22:06.861
Hahaha!

01:26:07.068 --> 01:26:08.936
I hear you,

01:26:09.336 --> 01:26:10.738
I see you.

01:26:11.639 --> 01:26:14.642
Your kindness, your love.

01:26:16.744 --> 01:26:21.849
We breathe, we feel, we live.

01:26:23.117 --> 01:26:27.354
Time, life, joy.

01:26:28.022 --> 01:26:29.991
Bring the world together.

01:26:30.925 --> 01:26:32.894
Say the words and mean them.

01:26:33.728 --> 01:26:35.930
Stay here with me.

01:26:37.699 --> 01:26:40.702
Breathe into a peaceful world.

01:26:42.269 --> 01:26:45.640
Man and woman, woman and man.

01:26:46.674 --> 01:26:50.611
We are free and we are
beautiful.

01:26:51.779 --> 01:26:53.815
We are soulful.

01:26:54.949 --> 01:26:58.953
The earth, the sky, the sea.

01:27:01.055 --> 01:27:05.193
Free, free, free...

01:27:07.528 --> 01:27:09.362
free.
