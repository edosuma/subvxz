00:03.629 --> 00:06.588
<i>Tune in to 101.2, Seven Valleys radio.</i>

00:06.757 --> 00:09.875
<i>Pushing Janet Jackson off her reign
at the top of the charts...</i>

00:10.052 --> 00:12.760
<i>...here's Roxette with their new single...</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:27.983
<i>The Berlin Wall. The Brandenburg Gate.
I'm Tom Brokaw.</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:30.486
<i>The Brandenburg Gate is in East Berlin.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:32.943
<i>The sound you hear,
what you're seeing tonight...</i>

00:33.116 --> 00:35.278
<i>...hammers and chisels...</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:38.536
<i>...as young people take down
this wall bit by bit.</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:42.198
<i>The Communist Central Committee
in East Berlin...</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:43.958
End of an era, huh?

00:44.127 --> 00:47.495
"Era." We need a five-letter word
that ends in H.

00:47.673 --> 00:51.633
<i>- Citizens from both Germanys are...</i>
- "Epoch."

00:52.177 --> 00:54.840
<i>- Reunited right on top.</i>
- Girls still asleep?

00:55.013 --> 00:57.005
Karen picked them up already.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.926
<i>On the east side of the Berlin Wall,
something new tonight.</i>

01:01.103 --> 01:03.595
<i>Soldiers dismantling it, not guarding it.</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:06.185
I... I gotta get to work.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.850
Sweetheart, it's still early.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.523
"Early" is on time.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.564
"On time" is late.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.734
And "late" is unacceptable.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.724
No, please. Who sent you?

02:30.901 --> 02:32.358
We can talk.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.985
We can... We can talk.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.912
- Can I play?
- You're in my line of sight.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.374
- There's a hole under the lighthouse.
- I'm playing the carom.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.789
That's it.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.379
Dembe and I have scheduled
a tournament.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.842
It's been in the works for some time,
but we couldn't settle on a format.

03:02.015 --> 03:06.225
I finally unearthed the Peoria System
with a double-par limit, and here we are.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.227
The tournament is this week.

03:08.397 --> 03:12.892
And I have every intention of winning.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.940
I thought all old,
rich white men were good at golf.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.733
Maybe it's my putter.

03:23.662 --> 03:27.622
Mitchell Dunning of Dupont Circle
is about to be assassinated.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.373
I'm sorry. Mitchell who?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.125
Dunning.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.878
He found me through an associate
and is looking to disappear.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.917
My problem is that I don't have
the resources to help him.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.427
Yours is that Mr. Dunning believes...

03:41.596 --> 03:44.088
...the hit was contracted
through the Travel Agency.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.473
A travel agency?

03:45.642 --> 03:48.055
Not a travel agency, Elizabeth.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.935
The Travel Agency.

03:50.105 --> 03:54.725
A murder-for-hire ring that lived
in the shadows for nearly 30 years.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.815
Their assassins carried out
a variety of contract hits...

03:58.989 --> 04:01.447
...until they closed their doors
12 years ago...

04:01.616 --> 04:04.029
...dashing any hope
law enforcement might one day...

04:04.202 --> 04:07.320
...solve the killings
the agency left in their wake.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.205
So if Dunning is right
and they are after him...

04:10.375 --> 04:13.334
Innocents and not-so-innocents
have targets on their backs...

04:13.503 --> 04:15.039
...beginning with Dunning.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.502
The Travel Agency was
a consortium of killers...

04:18.675 --> 04:21.793
...responsible for a variety
of unsolved murders.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.088
The assassination
of a civil rights activist in 1983.

04:25.265 --> 04:29.100
The poisoning of an anti-Glasnost Soviet
businessman in '87.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.603
What do we know about the man
who Reddington says is the next target?

04:32.773 --> 04:33.889
Mitchell David Dunning.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.274
<i>Lives in Dupont Circle
and imports high-end furniture.</i>

04:37.444 --> 04:39.686
<i>Offices in Paris, London and New York.</i>

04:39.863 --> 04:42.606
Keen, Navabi,
pull him into protective custody.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.490
I wanna know who wants him dead...

04:44.659 --> 04:48.403
...and why he thinks the Travel Agency
was contracted to do the job.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.619
Agent Ressler. A word.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.873
- I need to attend to a personal matter.
- Everything all right?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.666
Honestly, I'm not sure.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.757
I need you to oversee things here
until it's taken care of. I'm sorry.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.672
Of course.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.679
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for Isaiah.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.143
- Who?
- Isaiah Hill.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.024
Never heard of him.

05:22.405 --> 05:26.240
You're gonna open this door,
or we're gonna have a problem. Hello?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.071
Hey, I'll call the cops.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.158
Special Agent Harold Cooper, FBI.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.199
I'm not here on official business yet.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.244
Okay, look. I met him a couple days ago.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.707
I needed a place to crash.
He tossed me his keys.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.464
- I haven't seen him since.
- Where'd he go?

05:42.634 --> 05:45.342
- We unofficial?
- If you give me a straight answer.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.629
Isaiah Hill, where is he?

05:49.808 --> 05:52.425
- You packed the laptop?
- I told you, yes.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.219
With the phone and chargers.
What'd your sister say?

05:55.397 --> 05:57.855
Cabin's empty.
Garage code is the address backwards.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.936
Finish the bags. I'll set the alarm.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.524
Mitchell Dunning?
FBI. Agents Navabi and Keen.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.110
FBI? I don't... What's going on?

06:06.283 --> 06:09.071
We believe there may be
a threat to your life.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.657
You must have me confused
with someone else.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.743
- Going somewhere?
- Upstate for the weekend.

06:14.916 --> 06:15.997
It's Wednesday.

06:16.167 --> 06:20.161
Look, I appreciate your concern,
but you've got the wrong guy.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.330
There's no threat. I'm a salesman.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.623
I import...

06:43.653 --> 06:46.987
I'm sorry to ask,
but if we're gonna find whoever did this...

06:47.157 --> 06:48.568
...we need to know everything.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.361
Everything was fine, and then suddenly
he was rushing us out of the house.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.403
And then you show up and...

06:55.123 --> 06:58.036
- I can't believe this.
- Liz, you have to see this.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.379
I found it in the car.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.296
Do you know this man?

07:10.847 --> 07:13.134
No. Why? Who is he?

07:40.752 --> 07:42.584
Are you following me now?

07:42.754 --> 07:44.837
Mr. Kaplan gave you a suitcase.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.167
In it was a skeleton
she never should've unearthed...

07:49.344 --> 07:52.508
...and whose identity must remain secret.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.473
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.727
I understand the temptation...

07:59.896 --> 08:03.640
<i>...acting on a fine woman's dying wish.</i>

08:03.817 --> 08:07.652
<i>But your quest has cost Nik Korpal
his life...</i>

08:07.821 --> 08:13.909
<i>...and persisting will put
whomever you involve in harm's way.</i>

08:17.205 --> 08:18.992
I prefer no one gets hurt.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.663
Secrets put people in harm's way.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.547
Keeping them in the dark,
a talent you and I share.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.417
Or shared. I'm out of that business.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.807
And if I have a quest, it's to shine
a light on the darkness you create.

08:37.976 --> 08:42.515
To help Liz find her way out
of the enormous shadow you cast.

08:43.690 --> 08:48.151
You asked Nik to identify the bones,
and he was killed for his trouble...

08:48.319 --> 08:53.110
...by someone who knows their identity,
and, therefore, their value.

08:53.283 --> 08:57.402
That killer is likely searching
for a way to contact me...

08:57.579 --> 09:02.791
...since knowing their value,
he knows they are most valuable to me.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.376
I will allow myself to be found...

09:06.546 --> 09:10.836
...recover the suitcase,
eliminate the man for his troubles...

09:11.009 --> 09:16.175
...and rebury the body in a place
where it will be lost to the sands of time...

09:16.347 --> 09:19.010
...as originally intended.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.594
Whatever secret you're hiding from Liz...

09:23.688 --> 09:25.554
...it'll come out.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.850
Family secrets always do.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.191
- What's in the envelope?
- What envelope?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.988
<i>You will stop looking for Pete McGee.</i>

09:39.412 --> 09:44.874
You are to act
as if Pete McGee never existed.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.001
- Say it.
- Did he send you?

09:48.171 --> 09:50.584
Say it, Lena.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.878
Pete McGee doesn't exist.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.091
Keep it that way, or I'll be back.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.930
I don't understand.

10:04.104 --> 10:09.065
You think this man who was killed
was looking into my father's murder?

10:09.234 --> 10:10.441
Did they know each other?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.523
We were hoping
that you could answer that.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.109
Mitchell Dunning, I...

10:16.282 --> 10:19.446
- I don't think I've ever seen him.
- Were you and your father close?

10:20.161 --> 10:21.527
We were.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.162
After Mom passed,
I used to come out here every week.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.040
- Help around the house.
- Did he ever come to visit you?

10:27.210 --> 10:31.830
In the city? No. I don't think Dad left
the state after he closed the agency.

10:32.006 --> 10:35.215
- I'm sorry, "the agency"?
- The Seawall Travel Agency.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.880
- Dad owned it for years.
- Landry, do you know if your father...

10:40.056 --> 10:43.015
...happened to keep
any of his old work records?

11:08.376 --> 11:11.039
Knobbs traveled the world with his family.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.669
And orchestrated hits.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.376
Check this out.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.712
The civil rights activist.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.636
The Soviet businessman.

11:21.264 --> 11:25.929
Knobbs and his wife on vacation.
Look at the man in the background.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.393
It's Mitchell Dunning.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.556
Our two victims with nothing in common
owned a murder business.

11:31.733 --> 11:36.148
The people in the travel agency aren't
killing people. They're being killed.

11:47.457 --> 11:51.292
The name and address
of the miscreant you're looking for.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.381
How reliable are your sources?

11:57.550 --> 12:01.043
I understand you've placed Donald
in charge of the task force.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.380
I'm looking for a friend's son.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.885
A young man
whose father was killed last year...

12:09.062 --> 12:12.476
...and who drowned his sorrow
in drugs and alcohol.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.766
Mother took him to counselors...

12:14.943 --> 12:18.277
With Char and I,
she organized an intervention.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.483
And we'll do it all again...

12:20.657 --> 12:22.740
...as often as it takes.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.322
But we can't do any of it
until we know where he is.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.158
And my only lead is this dealer Castro.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.915
I don't wanna go busting
into a place on unofficial business...

12:32.085 --> 12:34.577
...unless I know it's the right one.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.043
- So are your sources reliable?
- Yes.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.173
You're going to need backup.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.504
To check some punk?

12:41.678 --> 12:44.216
Sounds like a delightful way
to spend an afternoon.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.301
We can play Celebrity on the way.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.928
- I appreciate the name and the offer.
- I warn you, I know all the absurdists.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.189
I kill with Camus.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.108
- Camus is not a celebrity.
- He is to me.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.102
Thank you for this.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.397
But I'll take it from here.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.582
FBI. I'm looking...

13:33.938 --> 13:35.895
Castro. Where is he?

14:21.986 --> 14:25.525
- I told you, I didn't need help.
- We couldn't resist.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.285
<i>Tune in to 101.2, Seven Valleys radio.</i>

14:35.458 --> 14:36.949
<i>And push...</i>

14:38.127 --> 14:40.995
<i>The Communist Central Committee
in East Berlin...</i>

14:41.172 --> 14:42.583
End of an era, huh?

14:43.591 --> 14:47.255
"Era." We need a five-letter word
that ends in H.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.004
Here. "Epoch."

14:52.058 --> 14:53.674
Are the girls asleep?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.763
Karen picked them up already.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.857
I... I gotta get to work.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.564
Sweetheart, it's still early.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.982
"Early" is on time.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.940
"On time" is late.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.910
And "late" is unacceptable.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.993
The Seawall Travel Agency,
based out of Allentown, PA...

15:17.166 --> 15:19.453
...was a storefront used
by Knobbs and Dunning...

15:19.627 --> 15:21.789
...to aid their murder-for-hire business.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.955
Knobbs and Dunning are
the two principals.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.045
Who hid their association
behind financial loopholes.

15:27.218 --> 15:30.427
The dossiers we found account
for dozens of unsolved murders.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.803
- They had help.
- Yep.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.839
According to other documents...

15:34.016 --> 15:37.475
...they had a large staff
who were doing far more than...

15:37.645 --> 15:41.059
- ...booking cruises to Acapulco.
- What do you mean, "had"?

15:41.232 --> 15:43.645
<i>Seawall shell companies were also...</i>

15:43.818 --> 15:46.777
...secretly paying account executives,
private investigators...

15:46.946 --> 15:48.653
...weapons-procurement techs...

15:48.823 --> 15:52.066
<i>...and a variety of what
I can only assume were handlers.</i>

15:52.243 --> 15:55.486
<i>- All of whom are dead.</i>
- Every employee murdered.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.700
Except for one.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.617
Mr. Argon Wright,
a shipping agent out of Baltimore.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.662
Let's bring him in
while he's still breathing. Navabi, let's go.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.472
Fentanyl is like snake venom.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.598
A hundred times more powerful
than morphine.

16:20.188 --> 16:23.397
A lethal dose of heroin is
about 30 milligrams.

16:23.566 --> 16:28.482
Three milligrams of fentanyl is enough
to kill an average-sized male.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.407
In every conceivable way,
I'd say you're below average.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.238
I don't know who you are.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.903
But you a cop.
You gonna let him shoot me up?

16:38.080 --> 16:42.040
We're looking for Isaiah Hill.
We think you know where he is.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.543
Tell us or you overdose.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.624
If you argue, you overdose.

16:46.797 --> 16:51.383
If the next syllable out your sorry mouth
doesn't point us to Isaiah Hill...

16:51.552 --> 16:53.760
...you overdose. Am I clear?

16:55.348 --> 16:58.716
Good. Because right now,
I'm an off-duty cop.

16:58.893 --> 17:02.853
And I'll do whatever it takes
to find that young man.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.186
Anything to say?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.772
No? Nothing?

17:12.365 --> 17:16.358
Perhaps half a milligram will be enough
to loosen your tongue.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.536
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I didn't sell him drugs.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.449
All right, he...

17:25.169 --> 17:26.250
He bought a gun.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.754
- A gun?
- That's not a location.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.541
Maybe another milligram will jog
your memory.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.552
My guy delivered it to him in Ivy City.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.259
Brick building on the corner
of 16 and Oak.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.133
Apartment 3.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.975
You just missed the ride of a lifetime.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.819
Lena, it's me, Tom.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.948
Come in.

17:57.118 --> 18:00.611
All right, so I ran a search on Pete
at the courthouse.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.324
He plead guilty to mail fraud.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.660
Why? He sold patient medical records...

18:04.834 --> 18:07.372
...to insurance companies,
so they could deny coverage.

18:07.545 --> 18:11.414
Lost his license, would've spent 12 years
in prison if he didn't flip...

18:11.591 --> 18:14.129
- You going somewhere?
- You should go.

18:14.302 --> 18:17.841
- Pete is a bad guy.
- I don't wanna talk about Pete.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.303
- You were gonna help me find him.
- You should really go.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.933
- Is Pete here?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

18:24.103 --> 18:28.017
And I'm sorry that your friend got killed,
but I can't help you.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.018
I went to the D.C. Clerk's Office.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.107
There was no record
that Pete McGee ever married.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.940
- What?
- Five minutes.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.535
Just to show you what I found.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.041
All right, let me grab a fork.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.419
Argon Wright?
Agents Ressler, Navabi. FBI.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.753
- FBI? What's going on?
- You may be in danger.

18:54.925 --> 18:58.384
- Danger? From who?
- We know about Knobbs and Dunning.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.422
- Knobbs and Dunning? I don't...
- Drop the act.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.465
We know about your involvement.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.805
Down, down! Get down! Gun!

19:10.232 --> 19:11.894
Move! Get out of the way!

19:13.736 --> 19:14.977
Move!

19:15.154 --> 19:16.770
Out of the way!

19:41.555 --> 19:43.512
Mr. C?!

19:49.814 --> 19:54.104
- We need names. Asset names...
- Everything was compartmentalized.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.858
We never saw each other.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.862
I didn't know the names
of the operators I handled.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.446
- Think a little harder.
- Look, lady, I don't know. It's...

20:05.621 --> 20:08.614
- That gunman, in the car.
- Yeah, the Oldsmobile.

20:08.791 --> 20:13.331
I used to run an asset who drove
a car just like that, '86 Olds.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.837
- This was 30 years ago.
- What was his name?

20:16.006 --> 20:17.542
We didn't use names.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.175
All I know, we called him Number Five.

20:20.344 --> 20:24.839
- You had to have a protocol.
- The agency would give me the target.

20:25.015 --> 20:29.225
Once they sent the dossier,
I'd page Number Five a signal: 342.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.431
Three-four-two?

20:30.855 --> 20:34.724
It's a reference to a post office box
in Seven Valleys.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.267
It's where he'd pick up his assignments.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.313
- Three-forty-two?
- Do you have a record of it?

20:40.489 --> 20:42.731
- I don't need one.
- Why is that?

20:42.908 --> 20:45.651
Mr. Dawson has had that box
since before I worked here.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.569
- Mr. Dawson?
- Calvin.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.206
Hardly comes in though.
His mail is delivered to the home.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.991
His house is here in town?

20:53.169 --> 20:57.584
Not a house. He lives at the convalescent
home up on Elm: Briar Oak.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.846
Message was delivered.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.353
Looks like the target is standing down.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.911
You could've killed us.
It's a miracle we weren't hurt.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.292
Are you even listening?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.500
Why are you here and with a gun?

21:40.466 --> 21:44.506
Whoever you thought
you were shooting at, we can help you.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.670
- Who are you?
- Why do you have a gun?

21:46.847 --> 21:48.679
- Protecting myself.
- From who?

21:49.517 --> 21:51.133
The line forms to the left.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.723
Perhaps you could be
a tad more specific.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.263
How about cops like you.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.978
- He's not a cop.
- Cops who beat.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.188
- Cops who kill.
- He's not a cop.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.024
- Then who is he?
- A criminal.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.157
Isaiah, please.
Who were you shooting at?

22:10.579 --> 22:13.788
I needed to buy something,
and my regular guy wasn't holding.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.950
"Something"? Fentanyl?

22:16.126 --> 22:18.960
I heard about this guy Zeke Wilson.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.751
He owns a club.

22:21.924 --> 22:25.042
Twenty-four/seven action,
if you can get in...

22:25.219 --> 22:26.676
It's like a candy store.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.301
I couldn't get in the front,
so I tried the back.

22:30.474 --> 22:34.309
Zeke was there in the alley,
arguing with a guy.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.845
Zeke...

22:37.022 --> 22:41.062
- He shot him.
- You're a witness he's trying to get rid of.

22:41.235 --> 22:44.649
- You should've told me, son.
- I am not your son.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.647
No, you're not.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.653
But I am your friend.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.786
And I'm here to help. Will you let me?

23:02.882 --> 23:06.296
Told my boss I forgot something.
I'm in Pete's office.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.460
<i>- You're on speaker.</i>
- Know his passwords?

23:08.637 --> 23:12.426
I thought I did.
Again, I thought he was married.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.434
<i>Anything Pete knows about the bones,
or where he is.</i>

23:15.603 --> 23:18.437
<i>It won't be labeled or easy to find.
So upload everything.</i>

23:18.606 --> 23:20.347
Who says they're married
when they're not?

23:20.524 --> 23:24.143
<i>- Isn't it usually the other way around?</i>
- Pete's a con artist.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.108
<i>He killed my friend
and sent someone to threaten you.</i>

23:27.281 --> 23:28.772
I got in. It's uploading.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.451
Sorry, where is Mr. Dawson?
We were told he lived here.

23:33.621 --> 23:37.285
He does.
But he's with Eleanor now, his wife.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.371
She stops by occasionally
and takes him out.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.752
Can you tell us about his condition?

23:42.922 --> 23:46.962
Calvin was injured years ago
in a robbery.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.298
Beaten badly and left for dead.

23:50.471 --> 23:53.384
Truthfully, he's lucky
to have survived it at all.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.766
But the brain injury left him
with anterograde amnesia.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.304
- What does that mean?
- Calvin can't form new memories.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.268
<i>He can operate in the present.</i>

24:02.441 --> 24:05.184
<i>But what happened 10 hours
or 10 days ago...</i>

24:05.361 --> 24:09.571
<i>- ...it's as if it never happened.
- His long-term memory is still intact?</i>

24:09.740 --> 24:12.904
<i>Yes, everything that happened
prior to the injury.</i>

24:13.077 --> 24:16.946
- End of an era, huh?
- For him, the last 30 years didn't happen.

24:17.122 --> 24:21.036
<i>He can do the same puzzle,
read the same book, eat the same meal.</i>

24:21.210 --> 24:23.668
- "Epoch."
<i>- Every time, it's brand-new.</i>

24:23.837 --> 24:27.296
What about when he sees a new car
or a flat-screen TV?

24:27.466 --> 24:30.504
Visual cues in conflict
with his world view...

24:30.678 --> 24:33.967
That he's living in 1989.
...simply don't register.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.007
<i>They go into his mental spam folder.</i>

24:37.184 --> 24:41.599
- Where are the girls? They still asleep?
- Karen picked them up early today.

24:41.772 --> 24:45.607
We need to speak with Mr. Dawson.
Do you have a number or address?

24:45.776 --> 24:47.358
I should get to work.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.069
Isn't it early?

24:51.615 --> 24:52.731
"Early" is on time.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.652
"On time" is late. And "late"...

25:06.755 --> 25:08.417
Hello?

25:10.592 --> 25:11.753
Yes, hi.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.754
Yes, I understand.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.638
Thank you.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.387
Who was that? What's wrong?

25:20.936 --> 25:22.347
Day care.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.683
Mia was on the playground and fell.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.190
- They're taking her to the hospital.
- Is she okay?

25:27.359 --> 25:29.225
- We should go.
- Let me get my purse.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.863
FBI!

25:36.243 --> 25:38.200
Right side is clear.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.827
Move!

25:48.756 --> 25:50.839
- It's still warm.
- Clear!

26:00.267 --> 26:02.179
Samar?

26:29.922 --> 26:33.962
"Morning radio, November 9th, 1989."

26:34.593 --> 26:36.300
Dunning.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.337
Knobbs.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.134
Wright.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.095
All of them.

26:48.857 --> 26:52.100
Eleanor, what's going on?

26:52.528 --> 26:56.772
I told you, there's been an incident.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.281
<i>The wife.</i>

26:58.450 --> 27:00.032
He lied to her.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.286
Led her to believe he worked
at a travel agency.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.572
Had a normal life. She had no idea.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.411
<i>I was just trying to get by.</i>

27:07.584 --> 27:09.416
Trying to take care of you.

27:09.586 --> 27:13.876
After the accident, there was a slipup
and she picked up on it.

27:14.049 --> 27:18.464
I was at the bank, trying to figure out
how to keep up with the medical bills...

27:19.429 --> 27:22.137
Your medical bills.
...when the bank manager asked me...

27:22.307 --> 27:24.970
...why I hadn't dipped
into your personal account.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.477
What account? I don't understand.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.230
- That's exactly what I said.
- She stumbled onto his finances.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.394
<i>I was able to connect the dots
by following the money.</i>

27:35.571 --> 27:38.905
Your travels were like a map.

27:39.074 --> 27:43.785
A congressman from Utah murdered
while he was in Salt Lake.

27:43.954 --> 27:48.415
A South African police general gunned
down while he was in Cape Town.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.450
<i>You can't imagine how angry...</i>

27:51.044 --> 27:55.004
...and afraid I was to find out
that the man that I loved...

27:55.674 --> 27:58.007
...the father of my children...

27:58.177 --> 27:59.713
...was a monster.

27:59.887 --> 28:04.598
<i>There's no closure confronting a man
who doesn't even know what day it is.</i>

28:04.766 --> 28:07.099
- So she just kept digging.
<i>- Every name.</i>

28:08.187 --> 28:09.519
Every number.

28:09.688 --> 28:13.523
It took me four years
to get to the Travel Agency.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.602
And another six to figure out
who worked there.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.647
Finally, she figured out his protocols.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.816
The codes, the systems.

28:22.993 --> 28:26.532
How the defunct Travel Agency
communicated with their assets.

28:26.705 --> 28:30.119
The post box in Seven Valleys
was the final piece.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.451
I figured out how it worked.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.461
The pages.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.872
The dossiers.

28:37.049 --> 28:41.794
She used those same protocols
to run her husband.

28:41.970 --> 28:46.590
Took advantage of his amnesia,
making him believe it was still 1989.

28:46.767 --> 28:51.683
Using him as her own contract killer
to take out those...

28:51.855 --> 28:53.938
...in the Travel Agency.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.525
<i>All the while he had no idea.</i>

28:58.320 --> 29:02.985
What... Whatever you think happened,
whatever you think I've done...

29:03.158 --> 29:06.777
Oh, I know exactly what you did.

29:07.871 --> 29:11.205
But you don't
because you forget everything.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.085
What a blessing that must be.

29:24.137 --> 29:27.881
Isaiah's father was pulled over
for having expired plates.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.300
Got out of the car to see for himself.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.764
Officers told him
to get back in the vehicle.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.147
But he paid for the tags.
He knew there had to be a mistake.

29:36.692 --> 29:40.732
He was unarmed.
Just wanted to see for himself.

29:40.904 --> 29:43.112
Officer gave him a second warning.

29:43.282 --> 29:47.151
When he reached to get his wallet,
the officer shot him...

29:48.287 --> 29:50.324
...six times.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.745
Isaiah watched the man
who murdered his father tried...

29:54.918 --> 29:56.625
...and acquitted on all counts.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.708
For him, for so many like him...

29:59.881 --> 30:02.089
...if you're black in this country...

30:02.259 --> 30:04.717
...and you say the wrong word,
you could be killed.

30:05.345 --> 30:09.555
Ask the wrong question,
look the wrong way, you can be killed.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.684
Almost every cop I've served with,
black or white...

30:13.854 --> 30:15.811
...I'd be proud to call him my brother.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.645
It tears me up knowing what so many
people in my community think of them.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.232
Like it tears me up knowing that the cops
who killed my other brothers...

30:23.405 --> 30:25.397
...will almost never be held responsible.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.362
Your justice system protects those cops...

30:28.535 --> 30:32.779
...as it will protect you,
no matter what you do to Zeke Wilson.

30:34.458 --> 30:35.949
Zeke Wilson...

30:36.126 --> 30:39.369
...is a bloodsucking scum...

30:39.796 --> 30:42.459
...who preys on people like Isaiah.

30:44.051 --> 30:47.510
Yes. And if you choose
to hold him responsible...

30:47.679 --> 30:50.171
...for what happened to Isaiah's father...

30:50.349 --> 30:52.887
...or for all the people of color
who are killed...

30:53.060 --> 30:58.055
...for saying the wrong thing or looking
the wrong way, you can do that.

31:00.275 --> 31:03.313
You may be black, Harold,
but you carry a badge.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.901
And, like it or not,
that means you're a made man.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.157
Your justice system will protect you...

31:09.326 --> 31:13.411
...just like it protected the cop
who killed Isaiah's father.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.492
Is that your observation
or your advice?

31:15.665 --> 31:20.126
My observation is that you came to
this party with an unregistered handgun.

31:21.755 --> 31:26.750
My advice would be, as Isaiah's father
got six bullets, I'd give Zeke Wilson 12.

31:26.927 --> 31:30.170
Order a rib eye,
raise a glass of ChÃ¢teau Latour...

31:30.347 --> 31:32.714
...and toast to a job well done.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.466
Sounds like a plan.

31:35.644 --> 31:39.263
Yes, if I were going in there, but I'm not.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.189
You're taking it from here, Harold.

31:42.359 --> 31:45.443
And while your system
won't hold you to account...

31:45.612 --> 31:49.572
...for whatever you choose to do,
your conscience will.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.610
In the off chance
that I've overestimated...

31:54.788 --> 31:57.280
...your tendency towards self-restraint...

31:57.457 --> 32:00.291
...Dembe will be there
to watch your back.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.632
Hold up.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.511
All right.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.823
Zeke Wilson. Don't point.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.329
Don't signal. Just nod.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.621
Guy on the couch? Beard?

32:47.299 --> 32:50.042
Special Agent Harold Cooper. FBI.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.762
"Special agent."

32:55.932 --> 32:58.640
What makes you special, Agent Cooper?

32:59.436 --> 33:03.055
I'm taking you in on felony charges
of intimidating a witness.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.894
- A witness to what?
- Murder.

33:06.776 --> 33:10.611
When he gives a statement,
I'll be charging you with that as well.

33:11.281 --> 33:15.525
- No idea what you're talking about.
- Isaiah Hill is a friend of mine.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.453
Isaiah Hill?

33:20.624 --> 33:22.581
Sure you wanna go down this road?

33:22.751 --> 33:25.459
Accidents happen to snitches
even when their friend's a G.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.087
- You threatening him?
- I'm saying, accidents happen.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.294
Hit by a car, drown in a pool.

33:31.468 --> 33:34.757
You can't arrest someone
for an accident, can you?

33:34.930 --> 33:37.217
Not-so-special Agent Cooper.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.134
You're right. I'm not so special.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.720
But I want my friend
to have a chance at life...

33:43.897 --> 33:46.264
...and scum like you where they belong.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.399
Zeke Wilson.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.899
You're under arrest.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.489
We need a location on Eleanor Dawson.

33:55.659 --> 33:58.993
Notify state patrol. We're looking
for a black '86 Oldsmobile.

33:59.162 --> 34:02.326
We issued a BOLO,
but tracking these two will be difficult.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.458
Dawson leads an analog life,
so no technology to trace.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.914
- No cell, no navigation.
<i>- What about the pager?</i>

34:08.088 --> 34:10.205
His wife probably used it
to signal Dawson.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.216
There is only one number
that's been calling that pager.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.378
Each page coming
on the same day as a killing.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.172
- The wife's burner.
<i>- Aram, trace that burner.</i>

34:19.349 --> 34:20.429
Yeah, all over it.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.942
What are we doing here?
Why are we in a cemetery?

34:32.112 --> 34:35.696
Calvin, sweetheart,
we're here to see the children.

34:41.496 --> 34:47.538
Every day, I tell you
Karen picked up Sam and Mia early.

34:48.043 --> 34:52.755
Karen hasn't picked up the girls
in 30 years.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.543
They're dead, Calvin.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.514
No.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.762
We were in Miami on a family vacation.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.604
I collapsed at the pool.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.686
My appendix burst.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.692
Do you remember?

35:14.654 --> 35:18.568
When I went into surgery,
you took the girls out of the hospital.

35:18.992 --> 35:22.576
You told me, you didn't want them
to be scared.

35:22.746 --> 35:26.581
But what you didn't tell me was that...

35:26.750 --> 35:30.710
...you had somewhere to be
that afternoon.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.204
A job.

35:36.009 --> 35:39.468
Eleanor, not my girls.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.967
You took our girls with you to kill a man.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.978
You left them in the car...

35:49.147 --> 35:53.357
...and walked inside
the back of a restaurant to do a job.

35:53.526 --> 35:58.112
Which should've taken you,
what, two minutes?

35:58.615 --> 36:01.449
But it didn't take you two minutes, Calvin.

36:01.618 --> 36:06.329
Because the man you went to kill knew
you were coming, got a jump on you.

36:06.498 --> 36:10.367
Left you for dead,
bleeding and beaten in the alley...

36:11.211 --> 36:15.125
...while our girls were locked in the car.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.588
Too young to know any better.

36:20.178 --> 36:25.549
The medical examiner said
electrolyte abnormalities kicked in...

36:25.725 --> 36:28.843
...and sparked cardiac arrhythmias...

36:29.020 --> 36:33.890
...and something
he called "skin slippage."

36:36.861 --> 36:39.274
Everyone from Seawall is dead...

36:40.824 --> 36:42.531
...except Wright.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.697
The police got to him.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.788
But everyone else.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.747
It doesn't bring the girls back...

36:53.920 --> 36:56.958
...or make me feel as good
as I thought it would.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.587
But you did it.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.932
Eleanor Dawson! FBI!

37:12.105 --> 37:14.188
I need you to put that gun down.

37:14.357 --> 37:17.771
They told me you were
at the convalescent home looking for him.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.436
- You know who he is, right?
- Yes.

37:20.989 --> 37:24.153
If you put your gun down,
we can talk about it.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.660
I don't know what you people think
is gonna happen.

37:27.829 --> 37:31.163
You don't gain anything by arresting me
or putting me in jail.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.706
I'm not a danger to society like he is.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.292
My name is Elizabeth.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.790
I'm a mother like you.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.427
I wanna understand.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.672
You're a mother?

37:48.224 --> 37:49.760
Yes.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.550
Oh, good.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.720
Then you'll understand this.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.459
That's it.

38:21.883 --> 38:25.092
That's my statement about what I saw.
What comes next?

38:25.678 --> 38:28.796
The U.S. attorney will review
what you said.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.839
Decide whether to file charges.

38:31.017 --> 38:34.226
And if it goes to court,
you'll be called to testify.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.638
In court? Against Wilson,
where everyone can see?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.228
Nothing will happen if you do.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.768
- You have my word.
- The word of a cop?

38:42.946 --> 38:45.063
A cop who knows
what you're going through.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.776
My father marched with Dr. King.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.363
He was attacked by police dogs
in Birmingham...

38:49.536 --> 38:51.744
...was beaten on Bloody Sunday.

38:51.913 --> 38:55.577
For his troubles, the Bureau opened up
a secret file on him.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.458
Called him a radical, enemy of the state.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.919
He was my hero.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.251
And the organization
I've devoted my life to...

39:03.424 --> 39:05.541
...did everything in its power
to destroy him.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.301
But that's why I devoted my life to it.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.134
To make sure the Bureau never did
to another black man...

39:11.307 --> 39:12.923
...what it did to my old man.

39:14.477 --> 39:15.968
And mine.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.684
Come on. I'll take you home.

39:21.818 --> 39:25.232
I need some help, Mr. Cooper.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.529
I'm gonna try.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.033
But I think I need some help.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.074
Yeah.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.661
Let's get you home, Isaiah.

39:43.923 --> 39:47.382
- Find what you were looking for?
- No, but I did find this.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.509
"Congratulations, Lena Mercer.

39:52.682 --> 39:56.016
You have qualified
to receive a UVA Visa card."

39:56.185 --> 39:58.643
- I don't understand.
- You have Pete's passwords.

39:58.813 --> 39:59.894
He has yours.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.228
He's using them to open
new credit cards in your name.

40:03.860 --> 40:07.854
The reason we can't find Pete is,
he's not using his accounts.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.067
He's using yours.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.362
And that's how we're gonna find him.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.784
The warning didn't take.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.248
Yes, sir.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.835
I'll make sure of it next time.

40:43.858 --> 40:49.024
I feel like you're a natural golfer,
and I'm just not.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.823
You're naturally good at many things.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.108
Like what?

40:57.914 --> 40:58.950
Like what?

41:01.209 --> 41:04.168
- You're good company.
- What? That doesn't count.

41:04.337 --> 41:06.203
Come on.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.460
I'll think of something.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.421
You know what, never mind.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.147
Slow down.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.486
Liz, why are we running?

41:35.660 --> 41:38.869
I don't know
why we just flew across town.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.073
- Will you?
- What?

41:42.250 --> 41:45.459
I know, it's spur-of-the-moment
and not very romantic.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.620
I mean, under fluorescent lights.

41:47.797 --> 41:50.756
These pens are attached to the table.

41:51.676 --> 41:55.169
But, look, with everything I see in a day...

41:55.346 --> 41:58.464
...I just feel so lucky to have you.

41:58.641 --> 42:01.759
- And if we don't do this now...
- Hey.

42:04.564 --> 42:05.850
Yes.

42:09.736 --> 42:10.772
That's it.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.437
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
