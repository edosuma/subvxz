01:21.641 --> 01:25.343
<i>Quiet out here.
Peaceful.</i>

01:26.779 --> 01:30.016
<i>No Noise except my own.</i>

01:30.049 --> 01:32.018
<i>No Noise except my own.</i>

01:32.051 --> 01:33.485
<i>No Noise except my own.</i>

01:36.055 --> 01:38.523
<i>Again, Manchee? Just go.</i>

01:39.759 --> 01:41.326
<i>You don't have to ask me</i>

01:41.359 --> 01:43.328
<i>every time
you wanna take a shit.</i>

01:43.361 --> 01:44.362
<i>Crawlers.</i>

01:48.300 --> 01:49.534
<i>I love that knife.</i>

01:59.511 --> 02:01.313
<i>Poo and eat, it's all you do.</i>

02:04.984 --> 02:06.318
Manchee, come on.

02:06.351 --> 02:07.519
<i>Cursed.</i>

02:07.954 --> 02:08.988
<i>Shit. Preacher.</i>

02:09.020 --> 02:10.823
<i>Cursed is the ground
because of you.</i>

02:10.857 --> 02:11.991
<i>Nobody goes
to church anymore.</i>

02:12.024 --> 02:13.926
<i>Shut up,
control your Noise.</i>

02:13.960 --> 02:16.495
<i>Control your Noise, Todd.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

02:16.528 --> 02:18.396
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

02:18.430 --> 02:20.066
<i>Think of something else,
think of something different.</i>

02:20.099 --> 02:22.702
- <i>Think of birds.</i>
- <i>Dust you are...</i>

02:23.102 --> 02:24.469
Preacher.

02:25.171 --> 02:27.940
To dust
you will return.

02:27.974 --> 02:29.842
<i>Why is the preacher here?</i>

02:29.876 --> 02:31.476
<i>We don't even need a preacher.</i>

02:31.510 --> 02:32.712
<i>Nobody goes to church anymore.</i>

02:33.411 --> 02:36.749
<i>Boy sinned.
Judgment.</i>

02:38.851 --> 02:40.485
<i>Shit, he heard me.</i>

02:46.025 --> 02:47.894
<i>Don't run.
Oh, he's hearing that, too.</i>

02:47.927 --> 02:49.796
<i>Just hide your Noise,
hide your Noise.</i>

02:49.829 --> 02:51.664
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

02:51.697 --> 02:53.766
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

02:53.800 --> 02:55.935
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

02:55.968 --> 02:59.404
- <i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>
- Do not hide your Noise.

03:01.439 --> 03:03.876
Open your mind.

03:03.910 --> 03:06.545
<i>Stop looking
at my thoughts.</i>

03:06.578 --> 03:08.547
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

03:08.580 --> 03:10.917
<i>I am Todd Hewitt,
I am Todd Hewitt, I am Todd...</i>

03:14.687 --> 03:15.988
<i>Don't show weakness.</i>

03:18.991 --> 03:20.660
I know your truth.

03:21.694 --> 03:25.097
An orphan, runt.
Unwanted. Weak.

03:26.431 --> 03:27.900
Like a woman.

03:27.934 --> 03:30.368
<i>Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't know.</i>

03:30.402 --> 03:32.805
<i>Never seen a real woman
before, they're all gone.</i>

03:32.839 --> 03:34.740
<i>They're all gone. All gone.
Wouldn't know.</i>

03:34.774 --> 03:36.742
<i>Never before. Never seen
a real woman before.</i>

03:36.776 --> 03:37.977
<i>Weak.</i>

03:39.611 --> 03:40.813
<i>Weak.</i>

03:42.882 --> 03:45.584
<i>My face hurts.
Keep your Noise down.</i>

03:46.853 --> 03:49.856
<i>Return to the ground
once more.</i>

03:49.889 --> 03:53.525
<i>Let the dust...
Because of you.</i>

03:53.558 --> 03:55.695
<i>Well, at least he didn't
bust my lip this time.</i>

03:58.698 --> 03:59.966
<i>You were no help.</i>

03:59.999 --> 04:01.100
Come on.

04:07.707 --> 04:10.877
<i>I gotta pee.</i>

04:12.845 --> 04:14.412
<i>Back from a hunt.</i>

04:16.581 --> 04:18.149
<i>Here comes Davy, useless.</i>

04:21.754 --> 04:24.724
Shit-shoveler Hewitt
and his dumb dog.

04:24.757 --> 04:27.492
<i>Thinks he's a man,
but he's never killed a thing.</i>

04:27.525 --> 04:28.861
- Better watch your Noise.
- <i>Snake.</i>

04:28.895 --> 04:30.462
You cocky
little son of a bitch.

04:30.495 --> 04:31.797
<i>Snake!</i>

04:35.600 --> 04:36.836
<i>Don't let him see
that it hurts.</i>

04:36.869 --> 04:38.570
<i>I can hear everything
you're thinking,</i>

04:38.603 --> 04:39.872
- <i>you dumb shit.</i>
- <i>Beat his ass.</i>

04:39.906 --> 04:41.506
<i>Shit, the mayor,
the mayor,</i>

04:41.539 --> 04:42.942
<i>the mayor, the mayor. Shit.</i>

04:44.143 --> 04:45.678
<i>Hide your Noise,
hide your Noise.</i>

04:45.711 --> 04:47.445
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

04:47.479 --> 04:49.015
Is there a problem, boys?

04:49.048 --> 04:50.182
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,</i>

04:50.216 --> 04:52.084
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

04:52.118 --> 04:53.653
No, Pa.

04:53.686 --> 04:56.022
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

04:56.055 --> 04:58.590
Very clever use
of your Noise, son.

04:58.623 --> 05:00.660
<i>Mayor likes me.
Thinks I'm a man.</i>

05:00.693 --> 05:01.761
I reckon you'll be riding

05:01.794 --> 05:03.696
with the Spackle Patrol
before long.

05:05.131 --> 05:06.732
Very clever.

05:06.766 --> 05:09.201
Maybe my son can learn
something from you, Todd.

05:10.036 --> 05:11.804
- Davy?
- Yes, Pa.

05:12.705 --> 05:13.806
Keep shovelin' that shit.

05:13.839 --> 05:15.207
<i>Shit-shoveler Hewitt.</i>

05:15.241 --> 05:16.474
<i>Asshole.</i>

05:21.914 --> 05:24.050
<i>I wish they'd let me
ride past the ridge.</i>

05:24.083 --> 05:27.053
<i>Stuck here,
there's nowhere else to go.</i>

05:27.086 --> 05:30.256
You get lost, son?
There's work to be done.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.557
Usually when you get lost.

05:32.590 --> 05:34.961
I was out getting that part
you asked for.

05:41.533 --> 05:45.071
<i>Beets. Always beets.
I hate beets.</i>

05:45.104 --> 05:46.706
<i>It turns my shit red.</i>

05:48.007 --> 05:49.541
<i>Manchee, here.</i>

05:49.574 --> 05:50.977
<i>Dog doesn't even want it.</i>

05:52.544 --> 05:53.813
How was your day, son?

05:54.714 --> 05:56.849
Uh, yeah, good. Busy.

05:56.882 --> 05:59.852
<i>That snake was very
clever use of your Noise, son.</i>

05:59.885 --> 06:00.720
<i>I reckon you'll be riding</i>

06:00.753 --> 06:03.055
<i>with the Spackle Patrol
before long.</i>

06:03.089 --> 06:05.124
<i>My son can learn
something from you, Todd.</i>

06:05.157 --> 06:07.126
<i>Very clever, very clever.</i>

06:07.159 --> 06:09.095
Mayor is not
your friend, son.

06:09.128 --> 06:10.629
<i>At least the mayor
thinks I'm a man.</i>

06:10.663 --> 06:11.831
<i>Thinks I'm smart.</i>

06:11.864 --> 06:14.066
Then maybe the mayor
can raise you, too, huh?

06:14.100 --> 06:16.601
Put clothes on your back,
food in your plate.

06:16.635 --> 06:17.770
<i>Shit, here we go again.</i>

06:17.803 --> 06:18.637
Stop it, you two!

06:21.874 --> 06:24.076
Stop it.
Stop it, you two, please.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.679
Control your Noise.

06:26.712 --> 06:29.281
I need you on the field
with me tomorrow, all right?

06:31.817 --> 06:32.918
Yes, sir.

06:41.127 --> 06:43.095
A gift for your birthday.

06:44.864 --> 06:46.832
Thank you, sir.

06:46.866 --> 06:49.769
<i>I always wanted a knife.
Like a man.</i>

06:49.802 --> 06:52.071
We're all that's left.

06:52.104 --> 06:53.773
We have to protect
each other.

06:54.106 --> 06:55.174
To do that,

06:55.207 --> 06:57.943
it's important you learn
how to tame things, Todd.

06:57.977 --> 06:59.712
Tame?

06:59.745 --> 07:01.981
Break them. Control them.

07:03.615 --> 07:04.616
By

07:06.719 --> 07:08.788
- killing them?
- That's right.

07:10.622 --> 07:12.557
Here, men must kill.

07:14.293 --> 07:15.961
<i>You're the youngest here,
Todd.</i>

07:15.995 --> 07:17.595
<i>You'd be
the last man standing.</i>

07:19.398 --> 07:23.736
<i>I'm the circle,
the circle is me and you.</i>

07:23.769 --> 07:25.871
<i>See, I wasn't born
into the Noise like you.</i>

07:25.905 --> 07:27.640
<i>I had to learn
how to control mine</i>

07:27.673 --> 07:28.908
<i>through years of practice.</i>

07:28.941 --> 07:32.011
Go to sleep.

07:32.044 --> 07:33.045
Okay.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.281
<i>I've had my eye
on you, Todd.</i>

07:35.314 --> 07:36.449
<i>You're exceptional,</i>

07:36.482 --> 07:38.717
<i>and exceptional men are needed
to hold the circle together.</i>

07:39.919 --> 07:41.087
<i>To do that,
it's important you learn</i>

07:41.120 --> 07:42.755
<i>how to tame things, Todd.</i>

07:42.788 --> 07:45.658
That son of a bitch
has his claws in.

07:45.691 --> 07:46.959
<i>I've had
my eye on you, Todd.</i>

07:48.027 --> 07:50.096
<i>Exceptional men
are needed in the circle.</i>

07:52.164 --> 07:53.766
<i>Scout ship A, prepare to enter</i>

07:53.799 --> 07:54.867
<i>New World's atmosphere</i>

07:54.900 --> 07:56.936
<i>in T minus 37 seconds.</i>

07:58.204 --> 07:59.872
<i>Copy that, Mother Bird.</i>

07:59.905 --> 08:01.674
<i>Still no contact
from the surface.</i>

08:01.707 --> 08:02.908
<i>We'll let you know
what we find.</i>

08:07.446 --> 08:08.314
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

08:08.347 --> 08:09.982
<i>the temperature
at point of entry</i>

08:10.015 --> 08:12.818
<i>will be a balmy 3,000 degrees.</i>

08:14.820 --> 08:16.989
<i>Please make sure your
seat backs and tray tables</i>

08:17.022 --> 08:19.091
<i>are in their full
upright position.</i>

08:21.260 --> 08:22.661
<i>Buckle up.</i>

08:24.730 --> 08:26.966
Think the settlers
are still alive down there?

08:28.467 --> 08:30.836
If they are,
they're gonna be happy to see us.

08:30.870 --> 08:33.105
They were expecting
the Second Wave years ago.

08:49.889 --> 08:51.123
<i>Don't freak out,
don't freak out,</i>

08:51.157 --> 08:52.191
What did we
just fly through?

08:52.224 --> 08:53.859
<i>Don't freak out.</i>

08:53.893 --> 08:56.061
<i>We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.</i>

08:56.095 --> 08:57.396
What did you say?

08:57.429 --> 08:59.331
I didn't say anything.

08:59.365 --> 09:01.767
<i>She heard that? I'm so scared!</i>

09:01.800 --> 09:04.203
- <i>Fire! Get out!</i>
- <i>Fire!</i>

09:04.236 --> 09:05.271
- Captain!
- <i>Fire!</i>

09:05.304 --> 09:07.173
- <i>Oh, my God. We're gonna die.</i>
- Captain, no!

09:07.206 --> 09:08.841
<i>What's happening?
What is this?</i>

09:13.212 --> 09:14.713
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

09:56.222 --> 09:58.791
<i>Behind on the planting.</i>

09:58.824 --> 10:02.728
<i>Need rain. Need rain.</i>

10:06.298 --> 10:07.833
<i>I'm the last boy
in the world.</i>

10:07.866 --> 10:09.268
<i>Someday,
I'll be the only one left.</i>

10:09.301 --> 10:10.970
<i>I'll just be all alone.</i>

10:11.003 --> 10:13.105
<i>I wonder if you can actually
die from boredom.</i>

10:13.138 --> 10:16.075
<i>I hate beets, it's always
beets farming every day.</i>

10:16.108 --> 10:17.142
Todd.

10:17.176 --> 10:18.210
<i>One day,
you'll be alone.</i>

10:18.244 --> 10:19.245
Todd!

10:19.679 --> 10:21.347
What?

10:21.380 --> 10:23.249
Check the panels,
please.

10:25.351 --> 10:26.518
Sure.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.462
- Go!
- I am going!

10:36.495 --> 10:38.564
- More!
- Shit.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.199
I'mma go get the other lead.

10:46.205 --> 10:47.373
<i>What the hell?</i>

10:53.212 --> 10:55.414
<i>Thief, hey! Orange.
Hey! Thief!</i>

11:03.289 --> 11:04.590
<i>Orange.</i>

11:04.623 --> 11:06.592
<i>Thief! Hey! Hey!
He's so fast.</i>

11:06.625 --> 11:08.060
Hey! Hey!

11:15.000 --> 11:17.202
<i>Go! Go! Go! Fast. Go!</i>

11:34.053 --> 11:35.921
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my...</i>

11:40.592 --> 11:42.328
<i>What happened here?</i>

11:44.129 --> 11:45.431
<i>Holy shit.</i>

11:46.098 --> 11:47.232
What the hell?

11:50.936 --> 11:52.538
<i>Is that...
Is that from the sky?</i>

11:52.571 --> 11:54.106
<i>Is that a spaceship?</i>

11:54.139 --> 11:55.541
<i>A spaceship?</i>

11:55.574 --> 11:57.309
<i>Where'd it come from?</i>

11:57.343 --> 11:58.544
<i>It's not from here.</i>

12:00.045 --> 12:01.180
<i>From the sky.</i>

12:01.213 --> 12:02.281
Hello?

12:02.314 --> 12:05.084
<i>Somebody was flying it.
The thief.</i>

12:05.117 --> 12:07.019
- <i>The thief. Survivors.
- Survivors?</i>

12:13.425 --> 12:15.027
<i>That's a...
That's a spaceship.</i>

12:15.060 --> 12:16.261
<i>A spaceship.</i>

12:16.295 --> 12:18.430
<i>The hell did it come from?
Where'd it come from?</i>

12:24.002 --> 12:26.405
<i>Graves. People. Dead.
Buried. Death.</i>

12:26.438 --> 12:28.307
<i>I gotta go tell the mayor.</i>

12:28.340 --> 12:30.409
<i>This is exciting. Spaceship.</i>

12:30.442 --> 12:32.311
<i>Spaceship. Mayor's gotta know.
Gotta hurry.</i>

12:32.344 --> 12:33.946
<i>Judgment.
Judgment is coming.</i>

12:33.979 --> 12:35.080
<i>Never seen
a spaceship before.</i>

12:35.114 --> 12:36.482
<i>Think it's from Earth?
How'd it get here?</i>

12:36.515 --> 12:37.950
<i>Spaceship crashed.
Spaceship. Spaceship.</i>

12:37.983 --> 12:38.951
<i>Shut up, Todd.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

12:38.984 --> 12:40.419
- <i>What's the rush?
- Gotta tell mayor.</i>

12:40.452 --> 12:41.420
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

12:41.453 --> 12:42.988
<i>What, you think
I can't hear your Noise?</i>

12:43.021 --> 12:44.289
What're you babbling about?

12:44.323 --> 12:46.225
- Nothing.
- Where you goin'?

12:46.258 --> 12:47.593
- Hey, come back here!
- <i>Control your Noise.</i>

12:47.627 --> 12:48.728
<i>Control your Noise.</i>

12:48.762 --> 12:50.295
- <i>Here comes that boy.
- Gotta tell the mayor.</i>

12:50.329 --> 12:51.563
- <i>Shut up, Todd. Shut up.</i>
- Hey.

12:51.597 --> 12:53.098
- <i>Hide your Noise.</i>
- Hey.

12:53.132 --> 12:53.966
<i>Hide your Noise.</i>

12:53.999 --> 12:56.268
<i>Spaceship. Shut up.</i>

12:56.301 --> 12:57.936
<i>Stop. Todd, stop.</i>

12:57.970 --> 13:00.005
<i>Is it real?</i>

13:00.038 --> 13:01.073
<i>Stop. Stop thinking about...</i>

13:01.106 --> 13:03.008
<i>Get outta my face!</i>

13:03.041 --> 13:03.976
<i>What're you talking about?</i>

13:04.009 --> 13:05.477
<i>Spaceship?
What do they want?</i>

13:05.511 --> 13:06.713
<i>Where's the ship?</i>

13:09.481 --> 13:10.582
- <i>Spaceship crashed.</i>
- <i>They're here.</i>

13:10.616 --> 13:11.617
<i>Is this
the Second Wave?</i>

13:11.651 --> 13:13.919
<i>Tell the mayor.
Gotta tell the mayor. Go.</i>

13:15.154 --> 13:16.488
Mayor, I found somethin'.

13:17.623 --> 13:19.324
<i>You should've
told me first.</i>

13:21.460 --> 13:23.328
There's a survivor.

13:27.366 --> 13:29.168
He'd been stealing
from our farm.

13:29.201 --> 13:31.370
I followed him here.
Here, look!

13:34.173 --> 13:36.241
Gotta be from Earth, right?

13:42.047 --> 13:43.282
Very good, son.

13:43.982 --> 13:46.251
Search it,
anything we can use.

13:46.753 --> 13:47.754
<i>The mayor likes me.</i>

13:47.787 --> 13:49.488
- <i>Likes me better than his boy.</i>
- Todd.

13:49.521 --> 13:51.156
<i>Shut up, Todd.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

13:51.190 --> 13:52.424
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

13:53.793 --> 13:56.395
The survivor,
what did he look like?

13:58.263 --> 14:00.098
He was too fast,
I couldn't see his face.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.701
What did he say?

14:01.734 --> 14:03.569
I don't know
how he was doing it.

14:04.737 --> 14:06.305
But he didn't have any Noise.

14:06.338 --> 14:07.473
Preacher never been wrong.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.510
<i>No Noise?
You gotta be kidding me.</i>

14:11.543 --> 14:13.278
<i>I know what that means.
No soul.</i>

14:13.312 --> 14:15.180
- Find her.
- <i>I'll find her, Pa.</i>

14:15.214 --> 14:16.716
- Get her!
- <i>"Her"?</i>

14:16.749 --> 14:19.284
<i>Wait. What? "Her," "find her"?</i>

14:19.318 --> 14:21.019
<i>Holy shit! It's a girl.</i>

14:22.387 --> 14:23.589
<i>Space girl.</i>

14:25.591 --> 14:26.726
<i>He's a girl.</i>

14:30.395 --> 14:32.030
<i>Never seen a girl before.</i>

14:44.076 --> 14:45.310
<i>From the farm.</i>

14:51.350 --> 14:52.451
<i>Whoa!</i>

14:52.484 --> 14:53.720
Stop! Don't come any closer!

14:53.753 --> 14:56.455
<i>Girl. Girl. It's a girl.
Girl. Oh, my God.</i>

14:56.488 --> 14:57.623
<i>Where are you from?
You're a girl.</i>

14:57.657 --> 15:00.492
<i>No Noise. Are you from Earth?
Girl! Thief! Shut up, Todd.</i>

15:00.526 --> 15:03.195
Sorry.
I'm sorry. I've just never...

15:03.228 --> 15:04.463
<i>Never seen a girl before.
Breathe.</i>

15:04.496 --> 15:05.564
Are you from Earth?

15:05.597 --> 15:07.634
<i>You're really pretty.
Yellow hair. Found her.</i>

15:07.667 --> 15:09.568
<i>I found her!
I found her!</i>

15:09.601 --> 15:10.837
Wait, wait, wait!

15:10.870 --> 15:13.205
<i>Shit! Stupid Noise.</i>

15:13.238 --> 15:14.641
- She's running!
- Got you now!

15:14.674 --> 15:15.808
<i>Go! Go!</i>

15:18.210 --> 15:19.244
Get her!

15:20.546 --> 15:21.748
<i>Look at you.</i>

15:26.653 --> 15:27.754
Get the girl.

15:33.592 --> 15:34.694
Bring her back.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.772
<i>"I am the circle,</i>

15:45.805 --> 15:46.706
<i>"the circle is me.</i>

15:46.739 --> 15:49.441
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me.</i>

15:49.474 --> 15:52.144
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me.</i>

15:52.177 --> 15:53.579
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me."</i>

15:53.612 --> 15:55.280
It's all right.
It's all right.

15:57.717 --> 15:58.751
<i>We got her.</i>

15:58.785 --> 16:00.753
It's all right.

16:01.219 --> 16:02.521
You're safe now.

16:04.623 --> 16:06.759
I'm David Prentiss,
I'm the mayor here.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.699
<i>Second Wave.</i>

16:12.732 --> 16:15.434
- <i>I think it's the Second Wave.</i>
- <i>This is bad. Bad.</i>

16:19.271 --> 16:20.439
<i>She looks funny.</i>

16:20.472 --> 16:22.642
Quiet.
Sit down.

16:31.416 --> 16:33.285
That was a terrible crash.

16:34.486 --> 16:36.723
And you are
the only survivor, miss?

16:40.459 --> 16:41.894
You're lucky
to be alive.

16:49.234 --> 16:50.369
Were you hurt?

17:04.383 --> 17:05.685
I saw the graves.

17:09.756 --> 17:11.156
I'm sorry.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.903
That must be overwhelming.

17:27.674 --> 17:28.875
- It's loud.
- Mmm.

17:28.908 --> 17:31.376
We call it the Noise.

17:31.410 --> 17:33.746
Happened to all the men
when we landed on this planet.

17:34.881 --> 17:37.717
Every thought in our heads
on display.

17:38.718 --> 17:40.285
It's fairly harmless,
though.

17:41.888 --> 17:44.891
Some of us can control it
better than others.

17:46.659 --> 17:47.860
<i>Can control it.</i>

17:52.899 --> 17:54.466
<i>She's one of us.</i>

17:57.003 --> 17:58.236
<i>Control.</i>

17:58.270 --> 17:59.404
Can you see mine?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.574
No.

18:02.607 --> 18:03.876
Didn't affect the women.

18:05.610 --> 18:06.813
Where are all the women?

18:12.517 --> 18:13.618
They're dead.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.289
There was a war.

18:17.322 --> 18:20.960
A terrible war,
against the native species.

18:21.861 --> 18:22.962
The Spackle.

18:27.033 --> 18:30.837
They overran our colony
and they killed all the women.

18:34.439 --> 18:35.540
Slaughtered them.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.883
Can you tell me
how you came to be here?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.654
You will have
to actually speak.

18:50.757 --> 18:53.592
The Noise didn't affect
the women, remember?

18:54.193 --> 18:55.594
Can't hear your thoughts.

18:59.065 --> 19:00.365
I was scouting.

19:01.466 --> 19:02.969
So you come
from a larger ship?

19:04.469 --> 19:06.404
Yeah.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.406
We lost contact with
the First Wave colonies,

19:08.440 --> 19:10.743
- so we were sent out to scout.
- Ah.

19:12.344 --> 19:14.680
And this ship will be
coming for you, right?

19:20.820 --> 19:21.888
How big is it?

19:24.824 --> 19:26.458
It's the largest
in our fleet.

19:27.794 --> 19:29.361
Holds 4,000 people.

19:30.529 --> 19:32.430
And it will be landing where?

19:32.799 --> 19:33.833
Why?

19:44.043 --> 19:46.279
Excuse me, for a moment.

19:55.087 --> 19:57.089
Don't talk to her
and don't let anyone in.

20:02.695 --> 20:04.931
<i>"I am the circle</i>

20:04.964 --> 20:06.464
<i>"and the circle is me."</i>

20:06.498 --> 20:07.532
<i>Is it Second Wave?</i>

20:07.566 --> 20:10.870
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

20:10.903 --> 20:12.404
<i>What does she know?</i>

20:12.437 --> 20:14.674
<i>What's going on
in there? Is she okay?</i>

20:14.707 --> 20:16.474
<i>"... and the circle is me.</i>

20:16.508 --> 20:19.511
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

20:21.479 --> 20:22.882
<i>"I am the circle."</i>

20:30.890 --> 20:33.025
<i>Don't talk to her
and don't let anyone in.</i>

20:33.059 --> 20:35.061
<i>Pa said
don't talk to her.</i>

20:35.094 --> 20:36.128
<i>Pa is not here.</i>

20:36.162 --> 20:38.764
Looks like it's just
you and me now, little sis.

20:43.135 --> 20:44.804
<i>Never seen a girl before.</i>

20:45.537 --> 20:46.672
<i>Girls are scary.</i>

20:59.118 --> 21:00.152
Hey!

21:00.186 --> 21:01.721
<i>Can't trust girls.</i>

21:03.923 --> 21:05.091
<i>What is this shit?</i>

21:06.859 --> 21:08.628
Be careful with that.

21:08.661 --> 21:10.830
<i>I do what I wanna do,
what I want.</i>

21:22.675 --> 21:23.676
<i>Davy!</i>

21:28.214 --> 21:29.982
What kinda crazy thing
she got in there?

21:33.618 --> 21:34.954
Where is she?

21:34.987 --> 21:36.488
She must've
gone out the back.

21:38.224 --> 21:39.524
Find her.

21:45.597 --> 21:46.598
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

21:49.268 --> 21:51.503
<i>Cannot trust girls.
Sorry, Pa.</i>

21:53.105 --> 21:55.975
<i>An angel
descended from the heavens</i>

21:56.008 --> 21:59.211
<i>to bring forth judgment. Yes.</i>

21:59.245 --> 22:00.545
Preacher.

22:00.578 --> 22:01.681
David.

22:01.714 --> 22:02.848
<i>Judgment.</i>

22:02.882 --> 22:05.517
I'm done living in exile.
If we take her ship,

22:05.550 --> 22:07.485
we can take control
of the planet.

22:07.519 --> 22:09.088
They'll be in hypersleep
when they land,

22:09.121 --> 22:10.957
so they won't expect
an ambush.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.627
We just can't let her
warn them about us.

22:14.660 --> 22:17.830
<i>The angel is here
to punish us. And so much...</i>

22:17.863 --> 22:19.999
She's not an angel,
she's a girl.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.169
She's all alone
and she's got nothing.

22:24.804 --> 22:28.808
<i>Martyr.
Truth demands a martyr.</i>

22:28.841 --> 22:30.575
<i>Judgment, judgment.</i>

22:33.913 --> 22:36.514
<i>Get her back to the
mayor, she can't be far.</i>

22:36.548 --> 22:38.084
<i>Go,
she can't be too far!</i>

22:38.117 --> 22:39.952
<i>She has to be found again.</i>

22:41.921 --> 22:43.723
<i>Girl's about
to find out what's what.</i>

22:45.590 --> 22:47.126
<i>Why is she so important?</i>

22:59.772 --> 23:01.173
<i>The hell happened in here?</i>

23:04.143 --> 23:05.543
<i>I hope she's okay.</i>

23:06.979 --> 23:08.147
<i>Space bag.</i>

23:10.049 --> 23:12.084
<i>Someone's gotta take it,
might as well be me.</i>

23:12.885 --> 23:14.120
<i>Take it.</i>

23:17.089 --> 23:18.958
<i>I bet she has
some cool shit in here.</i>

23:20.760 --> 23:23.095
- The angel moves swiftly.
- <i>Space bag.</i>

23:23.129 --> 23:24.764
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

23:24.797 --> 23:26.198
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

23:26.232 --> 23:27.700
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

23:32.638 --> 23:33.639
Oh, there he is.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.909
Todd! Come over here, son!

23:37.609 --> 23:38.911
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute!

23:59.799 --> 24:01.267
<i>Mmm. At least it's not beets.</i>

24:01.300 --> 24:03.335
Hey, Manchee.

24:18.084 --> 24:20.386
<i>Oh, my God. Girl! She's here.
Yellow hair. Shit.</i>

24:20.419 --> 24:22.655
<i>Uh, what the hell?
Space girl. Oh, my God.</i>

24:22.688 --> 24:23.989
<i>Girl! Be a man, be a man.</i>

24:24.023 --> 24:25.758
<i>Be strong. No Noise.</i>

24:25.791 --> 24:27.393
<i>No Noise. Girl.</i>

24:27.426 --> 24:28.394
What're you doin' here?

24:28.427 --> 24:30.896
<i>Why are you here? Yellow hair.
You can't be here.</i>

24:30.930 --> 24:32.898
<i>Scary. She's scared.
Don't be scared.</i>

24:32.932 --> 24:34.266
<i>Thief.
Should I turn her in?</i>

24:34.300 --> 24:36.702
- Todd!
- I'm coming, Pa! Hey.

24:36.735 --> 24:37.703
<i>Help her.</i>

24:37.736 --> 24:39.738
You gotta stay here,
they're all looking for you.

24:39.772 --> 24:42.241
Don't come out.
Manchee, come on.

24:43.843 --> 24:45.911
<i>Control your Noise.
Think of something different.</i>

24:45.945 --> 24:48.981
<i>Chores. My chores.
Gotta do my chores.</i>

24:49.014 --> 24:50.216
<i>I love my chores.</i>

24:50.249 --> 24:51.650
Hey.

24:51.684 --> 24:53.252
- Where have you been, son?
- Nowhere.

24:53.285 --> 24:54.120
<i>I've gotta do my chores.</i>

24:54.153 --> 24:55.387
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

24:55.421 --> 24:56.522
Yeah, I'mma...
I'mma do my chores.

24:56.555 --> 24:58.991
<i>I love my chores.
But you don't gotta tell 'em.</i>

24:59.024 --> 25:00.860
<i>You gotta tell them, Todd.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

25:00.893 --> 25:01.961
- <i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>
- Tell us what?

25:01.994 --> 25:03.129
It's nothing,
don't worry about it.

25:03.162 --> 25:04.230
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

25:04.263 --> 25:05.331
<i>You gotta tell 'em.</i>

25:07.266 --> 25:09.768
<i>Shit. Yellow hair.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

25:09.802 --> 25:12.838
Hey, Daws.
What can we do for you?

25:12.872 --> 25:14.373
We're looking
for that space girl,

25:14.406 --> 25:15.841
maybe she came through here?

25:15.875 --> 25:17.710
- Space girl?
- What're you talking about?

25:17.743 --> 25:20.246
Ah. Her ship crashed down
in the woods.

25:20.980 --> 25:21.814
Todd here found her.

25:21.847 --> 25:23.449
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

25:23.482 --> 25:25.050
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

25:27.419 --> 25:28.454
She dropped her jacket

25:28.487 --> 25:29.855
not too far
from your property,

25:29.889 --> 25:31.190
so I was thinkin' maybe...

25:32.258 --> 25:33.826
Maybe she came through here.

25:36.762 --> 25:38.764
Nah, nobody come through here.

25:38.797 --> 25:41.400
She... She ain't easy
to spot. She...

25:41.433 --> 25:43.068
She don't got no Noise.

25:43.102 --> 25:44.904
She didn't
come through here.

25:44.937 --> 25:46.172
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

25:46.205 --> 25:48.040
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

25:48.073 --> 25:49.241
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt. I'm...</i>

25:53.846 --> 25:55.214
Anyhow, I'll just take
a look around.

25:55.781 --> 25:57.783
No, no, no. Maybe not.

25:57.816 --> 26:00.085
You heard the boy.
Get on outta here.

26:02.087 --> 26:03.422
I'll be seeing you.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.768
The girl's in the barn,
isn't she?

26:34.520 --> 26:36.055
<i>Trouble, trouble.</i>

26:36.455 --> 26:37.489
Hey, there.

26:38.324 --> 26:39.792
Yeah, she don't speak.

26:40.226 --> 26:41.427
<i>Space girl.</i>

26:41.460 --> 26:42.928
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

26:48.801 --> 26:50.469
It's all right,
it's okay.

26:52.238 --> 26:53.973
- It's okay.
- <i>I know, she's real.</i>

26:54.006 --> 26:55.107
<i>Shut up, Todd.</i>

26:56.575 --> 26:58.110
Just...

26:58.143 --> 26:59.311
Wait here, all right?

27:00.212 --> 27:01.313
Wait here.

27:39.985 --> 27:41.553
I'm not gonna give her back
to the mayor, Cillian.

27:41.587 --> 27:42.821
I can't do that.

27:42.855 --> 27:43.956
<i>I like her hair.
It's pretty.</i>

27:43.989 --> 27:45.291
She can't go back there.

27:45.324 --> 27:48.861
We... Please, Ben, we have to help her.
Come on.

27:48.894 --> 27:50.829
She can't stay in the barn.

27:50.863 --> 27:52.398
Prentiss will find her.

27:53.532 --> 27:55.000
We have to give her back.

27:55.034 --> 27:56.568
We don't need that trouble.

27:56.602 --> 27:59.505
No, but that's not
what she wants, Cillian.

27:59.538 --> 28:01.173
<i>I'm not gonna give her back.</i>

28:05.344 --> 28:06.412
Cillian.

28:08.414 --> 28:09.848
This is the chance.

28:17.923 --> 28:19.291
Would you guys
quit lookin' at each other

28:19.325 --> 28:20.592
and somebody talk to me?

28:22.928 --> 28:24.563
Todd, if you want
to help the girl,

28:25.564 --> 28:26.932
you have to go.

28:28.635 --> 28:31.303
Go where?
There's nowhere else out here.

28:32.538 --> 28:34.073
There is.

28:34.106 --> 28:35.474
There is somewhere else.

28:41.113 --> 28:42.348
- Farbranch.
- Farbranch?

28:44.249 --> 28:46.452
- Others went over.
- A long time ago, Ben.

28:46.485 --> 28:48.554
They never came back.
They'll kill him in Farbranch.

28:48.587 --> 28:50.155
Not if he is with her.

28:51.223 --> 28:52.291
What about the mayor?

28:52.324 --> 28:53.625
Forget about the mayor.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.195
If you want
to protect the girl,

28:56.228 --> 28:57.563
you have to leave now.

29:03.535 --> 29:04.870
It's a long way.

29:05.938 --> 29:07.172
When can I come back?

29:18.951 --> 29:20.185
<i>They lied to me.
They lied to me.</i>

29:20.219 --> 29:21.220
<i>They lied to me.</i>

29:25.324 --> 29:27.559
Stay with the girl
at all times, okay?

29:27.593 --> 29:29.061
And don't let it on
you're from here.

29:29.094 --> 29:30.596
Why?

29:30.630 --> 29:32.665
Just don't mention
Prentisstown.

29:32.699 --> 29:33.532
What does that mean?

29:33.565 --> 29:34.634
What do you mean
don't mention this town?

29:34.667 --> 29:37.002
Just don't...
Don't mention you're from here.

29:38.170 --> 29:40.172
Son, you gotta go.

29:40.205 --> 29:43.442
I'm proud of you.
Your mom would be, too.

29:43.475 --> 29:44.309
<i>My mom.</i>

29:44.343 --> 29:47.513
<i>♪ Early one morning ♪</i>

29:47.546 --> 29:49.314
I'm gonna go get the
girl, all right?

29:52.484 --> 29:54.520
- <i>Farbranch.</i>
- <i>Farbranch.</i>

30:25.384 --> 30:26.753
Afternoon, Cillian.

30:26.786 --> 30:28.320
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

30:30.122 --> 30:31.123
Ben.

30:34.193 --> 30:35.527
We're here for the girl,
Cillian.

30:35.561 --> 30:36.663
I know.

30:36.696 --> 30:39.632
And I told your man,
she ain't here.

30:39.666 --> 30:41.701
You won't mind if
we look around a little, then?

30:44.036 --> 30:45.571
I think you and your men
should leave.

30:52.712 --> 30:55.013
What is this?

30:56.148 --> 30:57.149
You know,
we got a girl on the loose

30:57.182 --> 30:58.785
and all you can think about
is chopping wood.

30:58.818 --> 31:00.486
What's wrong with him?

31:00.519 --> 31:01.620
Come on, son.

31:01.654 --> 31:03.455
You don't have to hide
from me.

31:03.489 --> 31:05.057
Just tell me where she is.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.697
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

31:10.730 --> 31:11.764
Where is she?

31:11.798 --> 31:13.565
<i>Just keep him
out of your head, Todd.</i>

31:13.599 --> 31:15.367
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
Control your Noise.</i>

31:15.400 --> 31:16.535
She pretty, son?

31:16.568 --> 31:17.804
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
Todd Hewitt.</i>

31:17.837 --> 31:19.204
<i>Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

31:19.238 --> 31:20.606
I see
you're a little scared.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.075
<i>I am Todd Hewitt. Focus.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

31:23.108 --> 31:24.711
<i>Barn. Barn.</i>

31:24.744 --> 31:26.378
She's in the barn.

31:26.411 --> 31:27.513
She's in the barn!

31:27.546 --> 31:29.481
- Find that girl!
- <i>I knew she was here.</i>

31:29.515 --> 31:30.582
Damn it!

31:32.084 --> 31:35.120
- We got her trapped!
- Hurry. Hurry!

31:35.153 --> 31:36.723
Check around the back,
too, don't let her get away!

31:36.756 --> 31:38.257
Get those doors open.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.566
Todd, come on!

31:57.476 --> 31:58.477
Cillian.

31:59.679 --> 32:01.313
No, Cillian.

32:02.447 --> 32:03.482
Cillian!

32:03.515 --> 32:05.484
No, no, no, no, no!

32:05.517 --> 32:06.786
<i>Go, Todd! Go!</i>

32:06.819 --> 32:09.121
Come on, go, go, go!

32:09.154 --> 32:10.355
Go, go, go, go!

32:12.257 --> 32:13.559
Get her back!

32:42.454 --> 32:43.522
<i>Faster, faster!</i>

32:50.295 --> 32:51.597
Stop!

32:52.765 --> 32:54.299
<i>Faster!</i>

32:56.869 --> 32:58.537
Stop! Hey! Stop!

33:05.611 --> 33:07.179
I'll get her, she's mine.

33:21.728 --> 33:22.895
No, no, no, no, no!

33:24.262 --> 33:25.564
Shit! Whoa!

33:44.449 --> 33:45.785
<i>What happened?</i>

33:45.818 --> 33:47.519
<i>Cillian, is he...
Is he dead?</i>

33:47.552 --> 33:49.187
<i>Oh, man. Whiskey.</i>

33:50.589 --> 33:52.190
<i>Whiskey, Whiskey.</i>

33:54.794 --> 33:57.764
<i>Shit. This wasn't the plan.</i>

33:57.797 --> 33:59.932
<i>Broken leg. His leg.
He broke his leg.</i>

34:02.669 --> 34:04.369
<i>Whiskey.</i>

34:04.403 --> 34:05.838
<i>No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, sorry.</i>

34:05.872 --> 34:07.439
<i>Whiskey, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry...</i>

34:07.472 --> 34:08.407
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

34:08.440 --> 34:10.509
<i>Easy, boy. Easy, it's okay.</i>
Hey, hey, hey.

34:10.542 --> 34:12.779
<i>End his suffering.
No more pain. Easy.</i>

34:14.312 --> 34:16.614
<i>I'm sorry, Whiskey.
I got no choice.</i>

34:16.649 --> 34:18.250
I'm so sorry.

34:21.286 --> 34:22.722
<i>Say something to her.</i>

34:22.755 --> 34:24.422
<i>This is her fault.
Not that.</i>

34:25.322 --> 34:26.693
Hey, where are you goin'?

34:27.793 --> 34:29.896
<i>Deaf. She deaf, too?
Deaf, too?</i>

34:31.864 --> 34:33.264
Stop, I'm not trying
to hurt you.

34:33.297 --> 34:34.466
I'm trying to help you.

34:34.498 --> 34:35.935
- Will you stop?
- Don't touch me!

34:37.569 --> 34:40.739
<i>Holy shit! She can talk.
Oh, my gosh. She can talk.</i>

34:41.406 --> 34:42.574
Back off!

34:43.842 --> 34:46.478
<i>She has a high voice.
It's nice.</i>

34:46.511 --> 34:47.880
<i>Get the girl!</i>

34:49.380 --> 34:51.818
<i>Get her back
to the mayor.</i>

34:51.851 --> 34:53.853
<i>Prentisstown men.
Girl's in trouble.</i>

34:53.886 --> 34:55.688
<i>What am I doing?
This is a mistake.</i>

34:55.722 --> 34:57.724
<i>What have I done?
Should I turn her in? No.</i>

34:59.692 --> 35:00.960
<i>Very good, son.</i>

35:00.993 --> 35:02.527
<i>No. Mistake,
huge mistake.</i>

35:02.561 --> 35:04.563
<i>Shut up, Todd. Shut up!</i>

35:04.596 --> 35:05.898
I'm not...
I'm not gonna do that.

35:05.932 --> 35:08.034
I promise you, I'm not gonna do that.
I can't just...

35:08.067 --> 35:10.402
Look, there's this place.
I can take you there

35:10.435 --> 35:12.604
and you'll be safe. Okay?

35:12.638 --> 35:13.940
<i>Farbranch. Farbranch.</i>

35:13.973 --> 35:16.274
<i>Farbranch. Farbranch.
Farbranch.</i>

35:16.709 --> 35:18.010
What's that?

35:18.044 --> 35:20.445
It's a map,
what does it look like?

35:20.479 --> 35:21.647
Do you have a copy
of the map or the...

35:21.681 --> 35:23.415
No, I don't have
a copy of the map.

35:23.448 --> 35:24.717
Okay? It comes with me.

35:26.652 --> 35:27.887
<i>Keep her safe.</i>

35:31.623 --> 35:32.992
Could I contact my ship there?

35:33.926 --> 35:35.762
I need to warn them.

35:35.795 --> 35:36.929
Yeah.

35:36.963 --> 35:39.364
<i>I have no idea. I don't know.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

35:41.934 --> 35:43.568
Stay ahead of me.

35:54.613 --> 35:56.916
I'm not gonna
hunt my own son.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.416
I don't
want to hurt Todd.

35:58.450 --> 36:00.720
I just need to know
about the girl's ship.

36:02.021 --> 36:04.857
Now you come along
with us.

36:04.891 --> 36:07.026
And you make sure
nothing happens to young Todd.

36:07.059 --> 36:08.828
Just like you've been doing
all these years.

36:10.763 --> 36:11.931
Since he was a little boy.

36:11.964 --> 36:13.565
- <i>Keep him safe.</i>
- Remember?

36:13.598 --> 36:15.968
<i>Keep him safe, Ben.
Keep him safe.</i>

36:17.870 --> 36:18.938
<i>They'll kill him, Ben.</i>

36:18.971 --> 36:20.840
You've gotta know
where they're headed, Ben.

36:20.873 --> 36:22.507
Before she warns
that ship of hers.

36:22.541 --> 36:23.776
<i>Cillian, keep him
out of your head.</i>

36:25.510 --> 36:26.545
<i>Our boy.
Kill him.</i>

36:26.578 --> 36:27.579
Where're they headed, Ben?

36:27.612 --> 36:28.815
<i>Cillian.
No, no, no. Listen to me.</i>

36:28.848 --> 36:30.482
- Think.
- <i>Think of me.</i>

36:30.515 --> 36:31.483
<i>They'll kill him.</i>

36:31.516 --> 36:33.753
<i>They'll kill him
in Farbranch. Farbranch.</i>

36:34.452 --> 36:35.721
Farbranch.

36:44.462 --> 36:46.398
You take your time
burying him.

36:46.431 --> 36:48.400
Then I need you in town
with everyone else.

36:50.069 --> 36:52.071
- Cillian.
- <i>Ben.</i>

36:53.639 --> 36:54.807
<i>Bye, Ben.</i>

36:55.708 --> 36:58.476
<i>Keep him safe. Our boy.</i>

36:59.145 --> 37:01.647
<i>Our boy. Keep him safe.</i>

37:06.585 --> 37:08.988
Whatever happened to
"stay ahead of me", huh?

37:09.021 --> 37:10.723
<i>Don't girls ever get tired?</i>

37:12.457 --> 37:14.492
<i>Been walking for hours.</i>

37:14.526 --> 37:17.163
<i>Gosh, space girl is fast.</i>

37:17.196 --> 37:18.898
<i>Damn, I'm tired.</i>

37:18.931 --> 37:20.833
<i>Be a man. Be a man.</i>

37:20.867 --> 37:22.134
<i>Don't let her know
you're tired.</i>

37:22.168 --> 37:23.970
<i>I know you're tired.
Don't be weak.</i>

37:24.003 --> 37:25.771
<i>God, I hope this is the way.</i>

37:25.805 --> 37:27.439
<i>God, I hope
this is the right way.</i>

37:29.075 --> 37:30.575
Hey, can you slow down a sec?

37:30.609 --> 37:31.777
<i>She's gonna know
you're tired.</i>

37:31.811 --> 37:33.846
<i>Who cares?
My arm's killing me.</i>

37:33.880 --> 37:36.481
<i>Damn, my arms hurt like shit.
Shit, my arm hurts.</i>

37:36.514 --> 37:37.582
<i>I'm tired.</i>

37:42.487 --> 37:44.023
<i>I'm gonna
get infected for sure.</i>

37:44.056 --> 37:45.490
<i>Probably gonna die.</i>

37:48.861 --> 37:51.163
<i>Shit. Knife.</i>

37:51.197 --> 37:52.530
<i>Something's coming.</i>

37:52.564 --> 37:53.900
<i>Spackle.
Be a man.</i>

37:55.201 --> 37:57.203
Manchee, hey!

37:57.236 --> 37:59.171
Hey, hey!

38:00.239 --> 38:01.807
You tracked us here!

38:04.076 --> 38:05.912
This is Manchee.

38:05.945 --> 38:07.880
I guess
he's coming with us now.

38:07.914 --> 38:09.115
Come on, boy.

38:13.185 --> 38:15.655
<i>I've never been this far
out of Prentisstown before.</i>

38:16.554 --> 38:19.058
<i>God, I hope this is
the right way.</i>

38:19.091 --> 38:20.826
Do you know
where you're going, though?

38:21.961 --> 38:23.663
Yeah. Definitely.

38:23.696 --> 38:25.031
<i>Maybe.</i>

38:25.064 --> 38:27.767
<i>Maybe, maybe, maybe.</i>

38:27.800 --> 38:28.968
<i>Definitely.</i>

38:29.001 --> 38:30.036
<i>Maybe.</i>

38:31.037 --> 38:32.905
Hey! Get those knives!

38:32.939 --> 38:35.074
- Get as many as you can.
- Here.

38:35.107 --> 38:37.509
Fresh batteries.
Give it here.

38:38.044 --> 38:39.779
<i>Fresh batteries.</i>

38:44.951 --> 38:46.085
<i>I got this.</i>

38:46.118 --> 38:47.153
Let's go already!

38:51.290 --> 38:53.558
These ain't worked
in 20 years.

38:53.926 --> 38:55.761
Make 'em work.

38:55.795 --> 38:57.630
<i>"If one of us falls,</i>

38:57.663 --> 38:59.031

<i>Keep him safe, Ben.
Keep him safe.</i>

39:17.883 --> 39:19.719
<i>You can't control me.</i>

Hey, Manchee.
Get out the water.

What was that?

40:00.292 --> 40:01.626
<i>Lunch.</i>

41:10.696 --> 41:12.665
<i>Whoa. That's amazing.</i>

41:17.870 --> 41:19.604
Hey, what else you got
in that bag?

<i>Wish I could remember which
color scales mean poisonous.</i>

41:28.247 --> 41:29.882
<i>Probably doesn't matter
once you cook it.</i>

41:36.288 --> 41:38.157
You know, that's actually
not bad at all.

41:41.894 --> 41:43.062
Come on, you gotta eat.

41:44.196 --> 41:45.197
Come on.

41:47.333 --> 41:48.667
Just don't think about it.

41:53.105 --> 41:54.273
There you go.

41:56.909 --> 41:57.977
It's not bad, right?

42:00.980 --> 42:02.014
Can I have
some more?

42:03.482 --> 42:04.683
Yeah.

42:05.451 --> 42:06.852
Thank you.

42:11.857 --> 42:14.860
Everything I've ever had
was prefabricated.

42:14.894 --> 42:16.028
What's that mean?

42:17.263 --> 42:18.797
Created by lab techs.

42:19.999 --> 42:21.767
But you have fish
on Earth, right?

42:23.769 --> 42:25.070
I've never been to Earth.

42:25.104 --> 42:26.138
<i>What?</i>

42:26.172 --> 42:28.007
You were born on the ship?

42:28.040 --> 42:30.209
So, you're not from Earth?

42:30.242 --> 42:33.012
It took 64 years
to get from Earth to here.

42:33.045 --> 42:34.980
I mean, you don't look
64 years old.

42:35.014 --> 42:36.982
<i>Yellow hair. Pretty.
Really pretty.</i>

42:37.016 --> 42:38.317
Please ignore that.

42:41.453 --> 42:43.155
My grandparents
were from there.

42:44.123 --> 42:45.291
Things started
to get hard

42:45.324 --> 42:47.326
and they wanted more
for their kids,

42:47.359 --> 42:49.061
so they signed up
for the journey.

42:51.797 --> 42:53.432
64 years.
So they must have left

42:53.465 --> 42:55.201
before the First Wave
even got here.

42:58.437 --> 42:59.838
Why'd you come
all this way

42:59.872 --> 43:01.407
if you didn't know
exactly what was here?

43:03.409 --> 43:05.477
Why does anyone
look for a new place to live?

43:07.012 --> 43:08.747
They hoped things
would be better here.

43:10.049 --> 43:11.450
But they didn't know
about the Noise.

43:18.090 --> 43:19.892
So your parents
born on the ship, too?

43:23.229 --> 43:24.430
Are they still up there?

43:28.834 --> 43:30.202
<i>What is she thinking?</i>

43:34.173 --> 43:35.407
We should go.

43:40.012 --> 43:42.948
<i>Secrets. Secrets.</i>

43:42.982 --> 43:46.151
<i>Quiet. She's quiet.
No Noise, not right.</i>

43:46.185 --> 43:48.320
<i>She keeps secrets.
Secrets.</i>

43:48.354 --> 43:50.356
<i>She keeps secrets.
Secrets.</i>

43:50.389 --> 43:52.424
I didn't ask for any of this,
just so you know.

43:53.826 --> 43:55.427
I didn't say you did.

43:55.461 --> 43:58.030
Yeah, but your Noise said it.

43:58.063 --> 44:00.099
- What, my Noise?
- Yeah.

44:00.132 --> 44:01.800
It's just strange to see
everything you're thinking.

44:01.834 --> 44:02.835
You know,
it's strange for me, too,

44:02.868 --> 44:03.737
not knowing what's
going on in your head.

44:03.769 --> 44:05.437
<i>Not knowing
what you're thinking.</i>

44:07.139 --> 44:08.540
I mean, I don't know,
you might not like my dog,

44:08.574 --> 44:09.875
or you'd wanna hit me
over the head

44:09.908 --> 44:11.110
with a rock
or something.

44:11.143 --> 44:13.145
Why would I do that?
You have the map.

44:16.515 --> 44:17.549
That's a good point.

44:20.152 --> 44:21.353
And I like your dog.

44:32.298 --> 44:34.266
What if
the preacher's right?

44:34.300 --> 44:36.068
<i>What is this prick
tryin' to do?</i>

44:36.101 --> 44:37.269
<i>Find her.</i>

44:37.303 --> 44:38.570
<i>You gotta do
the right thing.</i>

44:50.316 --> 44:52.484
So, you see in the
distance on the horizon,

44:52.518 --> 44:54.186
that Noise
in that tree line?

44:56.622 --> 44:59.024
That's Spackle Noise.
We gotta head further west.

45:00.292 --> 45:02.895
They're aliens.

45:02.928 --> 45:05.197
Tryin' to wipe us out.

45:05.230 --> 45:06.565
Aren't we the aliens?

45:06.598 --> 45:08.267
What does that mean?

45:08.300 --> 45:10.836
They're native,
that means we're the aliens.

45:12.037 --> 45:14.006
They killed all the women
in my town,

45:14.039 --> 45:16.075
including my mom.

45:16.108 --> 45:18.010
So, yeah,
they're the aliens.

45:24.550 --> 45:26.885
It feels like
we've been walking all night.

45:29.922 --> 45:31.890
How do you know
it's night?

45:32.491 --> 45:34.026
It's never dark.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.063
<i>Cold, shit.
Cold, cold, shit!</i>

45:38.097 --> 45:40.499
<i>Idiot. Idiot.</i>

45:40.532 --> 45:43.068
<i>Ah, good.
She didn't see that.</i>

45:43.535 --> 45:44.937
I saw that.

45:59.652 --> 46:01.654
The rain is colder
than I thought.

46:02.588 --> 46:04.356
You've never seen
rain before?

46:07.960 --> 46:09.595
My father
told me about it.

46:16.101 --> 46:17.369
<i>Sad.</i>

46:20.139 --> 46:22.241
<i>She's sad.</i>

46:22.274 --> 46:24.276
<i>The hell am I gonna do,
she's probably hungry.</i>

46:33.385 --> 46:35.354
<i>How'd that get there?</i>

46:35.387 --> 46:37.256
<i>I'm proud of you, son.</i>

46:37.289 --> 46:39.224
<i>Your mom would be, too.</i>

46:47.232 --> 46:48.600
My parents are dead.

46:50.670 --> 46:51.570
They got sick on the ship.

46:51.603 --> 46:53.605
They knew they'd
never make it to New World.

47:01.079 --> 47:02.214
I'm sorry.

47:06.618 --> 47:08.655
They made me promise
I'd make it here.

47:09.455 --> 47:11.123
Find a better life.

47:13.425 --> 47:15.494
They gave it all up for me
to have this.

47:16.629 --> 47:18.731
It's not exactly
what I'd imagined.

47:21.266 --> 47:23.068
<i>Lonely, like me.</i>

47:24.069 --> 47:25.537
Yeah, a little.

47:44.423 --> 47:46.291
What're you doing?

47:48.227 --> 47:50.395
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I'm sorry. Um...

47:50.429 --> 47:51.698
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

47:51.731 --> 47:53.298
I don't know what
I was think... I'm sorry.

47:53.332 --> 47:55.300
I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna go.

47:55.334 --> 47:57.302
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

47:57.336 --> 47:59.304
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

47:59.338 --> 48:00.572
Manchee. Come on.

48:00.606 --> 48:02.407
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

48:04.376 --> 48:06.278
Manchee!

48:24.530 --> 48:26.164
Hey.

48:42.414 --> 48:43.549
Hey.

48:45.885 --> 48:48.086
Hey!

48:52.491 --> 48:54.226
I'm Viola.

48:55.127 --> 48:57.162
- What?
- I'm Viola.

48:59.364 --> 49:01.567
- I'm Todd.
- Todd Hewitt. Yeah, I know.

49:04.904 --> 49:07.306
<i>I'm Viola.</i>

49:07.339 --> 49:08.741
<i>Viola.</i>

49:08.775 --> 49:10.309
<i>Viola.</i>

49:10.342 --> 49:11.678
<i>Viola.</i>

49:11.711 --> 49:13.245
<i>I'm Viola.</i>

49:13.746 --> 49:15.147
<i>Viola.</i>

49:15.748 --> 49:18.150
<i>Viola.</i>

49:20.519 --> 49:22.487
<i>Viola. I'm Viola.</i>

49:24.189 --> 49:25.324
<i>High voice.</i>

49:25.992 --> 49:27.694
<i>Viola.</i>

49:30.162 --> 49:31.764
Hey. Come back,
come back, come back.

49:33.700 --> 49:34.901
Manchee.

49:34.934 --> 49:36.401
<i>Spackle. Spackle.</i>

49:37.569 --> 49:39.338
What was that?

49:39.371 --> 49:41.239
That was a Spackle village.

49:45.645 --> 49:47.714
Back!

49:47.747 --> 49:49.649
Get down, get down, get down!

49:51.718 --> 49:53.518
<i>Todd, fight.
Come on, Todd. Be a man.</i>

49:53.552 --> 49:54.687
<i>Focus. Control your Noise.</i>

49:54.721 --> 49:56.355
<i>They killed my mom.
Stop doing that!</i>

49:56.388 --> 49:57.522
<i>Be a man! Control your Noise.</i>

49:57.556 --> 49:58.891
<i>They killed my mom.
Todd, stop!</i>

49:58.925 --> 50:00.425
- <i>Shut up!</i>
- Be quiet.

50:00.459 --> 50:01.560
I'm trying. I'm trying.

50:01.593 --> 50:02.662
<i>Stop. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

50:02.695 --> 50:04.262
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

50:04.296 --> 50:06.365
No!

50:50.009 --> 50:52.244
Todd, stop!

50:57.750 --> 50:58.651
<i>I'mma kill him.</i>

50:58.685 --> 51:00.452
<i>I swear to
God, I'mma kill him.</i>

51:01.319 --> 51:02.421
<i>Damn it.</i>

51:04.589 --> 51:06.926
<i>What am I doing?
Mistake.</i>

51:15.333 --> 51:17.369
<i>The mayor said
you gotta kill him.</i>

51:17.402 --> 51:19.404
<i>Don't look at me like that,
gotta kill to survive.</i>

51:19.438 --> 51:21.373
<i>You don't know.
You don't know anything.</i>

51:23.009 --> 51:25.510
It would've killed us.

51:25.544 --> 51:28.014
So your solution to everything
is to just kill it?

51:28.047 --> 51:29.716
I was protecting you.

51:31.416 --> 51:33.385
It went for you,
not me.

51:33.418 --> 51:35.688
<i>They didn't want
to share their planet with us.</i>

51:35.722 --> 51:38.691
<i>They killed all our women.
All our women.</i>

51:38.725 --> 51:40.625
Do you just believe
everything that guy says?

51:40.660 --> 51:41.994
Our mayor
is a war hero.

51:44.063 --> 51:46.331
Doesn't mean you
shouldn't ask questions.

51:46.364 --> 51:48.034
<i>Idiot. You're such an idiot.</i>

51:48.067 --> 51:50.703
<i>Such an idiot.
Such an idiot, Todd.</i>

51:50.737 --> 51:51.971
I didn't say that.

51:59.511 --> 52:00.913
<i>Farbranch.</i>

52:05.852 --> 52:07.687
<i>Farbranch.
Farbranch?</i>

52:30.710 --> 52:31.978
Is this Farbranch?

52:32.011 --> 52:33.545
It has to be.

52:54.466 --> 52:56.334
Hey.

52:59.806 --> 53:01.306
Grapes.

53:02.607 --> 53:03.843
Hey, wait up.

53:04.476 --> 53:05.645
Mmm.

53:30.870 --> 53:32.738
This is weird.
Where is everybody?

53:32.772 --> 53:33.706
<i>Don't mention
Prentisstown.</i>

53:33.739 --> 53:34.740
<i>They'll kill him
in Farbranch!</i>

53:34.774 --> 53:36.709
<i>Just don't mention
you are from here.</i>

53:36.742 --> 53:39.411
<i>...kill him in Farbranch.</i>

53:39.444 --> 53:41.814
There are tools,
they must be around here somewhere.

53:49.689 --> 53:51.123
Maybe the Spackle came.

53:55.460 --> 53:56.662
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:56.696 --> 53:57.897
<i>Dog. Dog.</i>

54:01.634 --> 54:03.069
<i>That's a little girl.</i>

54:03.102 --> 54:05.570
<i>It's a little girl.
What is this place?</i>

54:05.604 --> 54:06.873
What are you doing here?

54:07.907 --> 54:09.374
Is this Farbranch?

54:10.176 --> 54:11.576
<i>Outsiders.</i>

54:12.044 --> 54:13.045
Yeah.

54:15.848 --> 54:18.050
<i>She's so small,
another girl.</i>

54:18.084 --> 54:20.052
<i>I'm not the youngest.</i>

54:20.086 --> 54:22.121
<i>She doesn't have Noise.
Women have no Noise.</i>

54:22.154 --> 54:24.456
- <i>Supposed to be dead.</i>
- Stop that!

54:24.489 --> 54:25.825
<i>What is going on?
What the hell is going on?</i>

54:25.858 --> 54:27.559
Wait here.
I'll get the mayor.

54:27.592 --> 54:29.527
<i>What is this place?
There's women everywhere.</i>

54:29.561 --> 54:30.930
<i>Little kids.
None of this makes sense.</i>

54:30.963 --> 54:32.430
<i>What the hell
is going on?</i>

54:32.464 --> 54:33.766
<i>Oh, my God.
It's a baby.</i>

54:35.234 --> 54:37.036
<i>No Noise.
Women have no Noise.</i>

54:39.906 --> 54:41.874
<i>Oh, my God.
The mayor's a woman.</i>

54:41.908 --> 54:44.744
Last time I checked.
Where are you two from?

54:44.777 --> 54:45.678
<i>Control
your Noise.</i>

54:45.711 --> 54:47.445
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

54:47.479 --> 54:50.448
Okay, Todd Hewitt.
Where are you from?

54:50.482 --> 54:52.151
<i>Don't mention
you are from here.</i>

54:52.184 --> 54:53.585
Prentisstown.

54:53.618 --> 54:54.820
Prentisstown?

54:54.854 --> 54:56.722
Oh, my!
What are they doing here?

54:58.157 --> 54:59.491
They got no business here.

55:08.935 --> 55:10.202
Is it true?

55:11.203 --> 55:12.872
You're from Prentisstown?

55:15.641 --> 55:17.442
- Mmm-hmm.
- <i>Better be afraid, boy.</i>

55:18.911 --> 55:22.514
Well, any son of a bitch
stupid enough

55:22.547 --> 55:24.582
to come here from
Prentisstown gets the rope.

55:26.052 --> 55:27.153
<i>Oh,
this doesn't look good.</i>

55:27.186 --> 55:29.621
<i>Okay, they're gonna beat
the crap out of me now.</i>

55:29.655 --> 55:32.758
<i>This sucks.
Come on, Todd, be tough.</i>

55:32.792 --> 55:34.660
<i>Think of something tough.
Birds, birds.</i>

55:34.694 --> 55:36.829
<i>No. No, that's not tough.
Come on, Todd.</i>

55:36.862 --> 55:38.631
<i>Okay, come on then,
let's go.</i>

55:38.664 --> 55:39.899
<i>I think I can handle
three of you.</i>

55:39.932 --> 55:41.067
<i>I can take three. Four?</i>

55:43.202 --> 55:45.004
<i>Maybe the spit
was too much.</i>

55:46.872 --> 55:49.041
Mayor, you know the law.

55:49.075 --> 55:51.543
The law
don't apply to boys.

55:51.576 --> 55:54.113
You're from Prentisstown,
aren't you, Matthew?

55:54.146 --> 55:55.613
<i>What the hell?</i>

55:55.648 --> 55:57.650
<i>I didn't know they
would really do it.</i>

55:57.683 --> 56:00.686
<i>The hell does that mean?
The hell does that mean?</i>

56:01.454 --> 56:04.256
You leave our town,
Prentissboy,

56:04.290 --> 56:05.590
or you'll be sorry.

56:05.623 --> 56:06.524
<i>This guy is crazy.</i>

56:06.558 --> 56:09.261
There'll be no threats
from you, Matthew,

56:09.295 --> 56:10.595
or anyone else.

56:11.230 --> 56:12.832
Now get back to work.

56:21.073 --> 56:22.641
You're welcome
to stay with me.

56:28.613 --> 56:29.782
I'll be watching you.

56:34.653 --> 56:36.789
Let's go get these bags
unpacked. Let's go.

56:36.822 --> 56:38.858
Move, get 'em unpacked, quick!

56:38.891 --> 56:40.726
Charlie! Eli!

56:40.760 --> 56:42.161
I want y'all
to gather some men,

56:42.194 --> 56:43.295
find some food
for me and the mayor.

56:43.329 --> 56:46.866
The rest of you get some rest.
Move your asses, let's go!

56:46.899 --> 56:48.734
Don't let them rest
too long.

56:48.768 --> 56:49.869
Yes, sir.

56:49.902 --> 56:52.604
That ship is flying at us.
It'll be here any second.

56:52.638 --> 56:55.775
<i>All around!
Sickness. Sick.</i>

56:55.808 --> 56:56.809
<i>Sinner!</i>

56:58.177 --> 57:01.213
<i>Sickness all around.
Revealed to us.</i>

57:01.247 --> 57:02.782
<i>Angel brings judgment.</i>

57:02.815 --> 57:05.084
<i>Wickedness brings sickness
all around.</i>

57:05.117 --> 57:07.753
<i>The wickedness of man
is great!</i>

57:07.787 --> 57:08.954
<i>His Noise!</i>

57:08.988 --> 57:10.656
You need to control
your Noise, preacher.

57:10.689 --> 57:13.325
- <i>The wickedness of sin.</i>
- You're scaring the men.

57:13.359 --> 57:15.761
Embrace the gift
this planet gives us.

57:16.395 --> 57:17.663
Truth.

57:17.696 --> 57:19.932
<i>Truth, the gift of Noise.</i>

57:19.965 --> 57:21.167
And face judgment.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.234
<i>Judgment.</i>

57:22.268 --> 57:26.005
Oh, yeah?
This judgment of yours...

57:27.773 --> 57:30.910
Does it kill all of us
and spare only you?

57:30.943 --> 57:34.080
<i>"I'm the circle
and the circle is you."</i>

57:37.650 --> 57:40.352
You hide your Noise
like a woman.

57:41.987 --> 57:44.657
- I consider that a compliment.
- It's not.

57:45.991 --> 57:48.227
Weakness rots from within.

57:48.260 --> 57:50.196
Thank you for the sermon.

57:53.265 --> 57:57.203
<i>I see your truth,
I know your truth.</i>

57:59.905 --> 58:02.108
Viola, you can
sleep in here.

58:05.244 --> 58:07.880
Todd, you and the dog can
sleep next door with my dad.

58:07.913 --> 58:09.281
I'm gonna see if I can
get you some clean clothes

58:09.315 --> 58:10.950
and the two of you
need to wash up.

58:10.983 --> 58:14.386
- I don't need clean clothes.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

58:20.893 --> 58:22.261
What are you doing?

58:23.028 --> 58:25.664
- Taking a bath, why?
- In your clothes?

58:25.698 --> 58:28.234
Yeah. These stink
as much as I do.

58:29.168 --> 58:30.669
That's good.

58:33.205 --> 58:35.307
I never had
a hot bath before.

58:38.477 --> 58:41.147
I have to find a way
to send a message to my ship.

58:43.249 --> 58:44.850
Okay.

58:46.285 --> 58:47.786
Okay.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.896
We're church settlers
trying to live a simple life

58:56.929 --> 58:58.330
so we let that machinery
go to ruin

58:58.364 --> 59:02.067
and got on with
the business of surviving.

59:02.101 --> 59:04.737
You have no way of
communicating with anyone?

59:04.770 --> 59:05.738
We have no communicators

59:05.771 --> 59:07.840
for any other settlement,
let alone beyond.

59:14.413 --> 59:15.848
Here are the clothes
you asked for.

59:15.881 --> 59:16.782
Thank you, Julie.

59:16.815 --> 59:19.018
- How long they stayin'?
- Thank you, Julie.

59:20.519 --> 59:22.755
Okay. Get.
This is not a zoo.

59:23.389 --> 59:24.423
Go.

59:29.061 --> 59:32.031
New settlers coming,
it's big news.

59:32.064 --> 59:34.833
People are scared
of what they don't know.

59:38.103 --> 59:39.271
When does your ship land?

59:43.209 --> 59:46.278
System entry will be any day.
If I don't contact them soon,

59:46.312 --> 59:48.047
they might move on
to the next system

59:48.080 --> 59:50.149
and I'll be stranded.

59:50.182 --> 59:52.318
<i>I hope they don't land,
and she's stuck here.</i>

59:54.253 --> 59:55.354
Sorry.

59:55.387 --> 59:57.156
I... I didn't mean
to think that.

59:59.191 --> 01:00:01.460
What you need to contact
your ship is in Haven.

01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:03.429
Haven?

01:00:03.462 --> 01:00:05.097
It's the first settlement.

01:00:06.332 --> 01:00:08.267
<i>Another town?
More people.</i>

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.035
You didn't just think
there were two settlements

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:11.303
in all of New World,
did you?

01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:13.872
No, of course not.

01:00:13.906 --> 01:00:15.241
<i>Thought it was one.</i>

01:00:17.876 --> 01:00:19.378
We'll leave in the morning.

01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:20.846
<i>I'd rather
stay with you, Todd.</i>

01:00:20.879 --> 01:00:22.114
<i>I'd rather be
with you.</i>

01:00:22.147 --> 01:00:24.283
<i>Kiss me, Todd.
Kiss me.</i>

01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:26.852
No, wait. I didn't mean
to say that, I'm sorry.

01:00:27.219 --> 01:00:28.287
Viola.

01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:46.939
Men and women don't sleep
together in the same places

01:00:46.972 --> 01:00:49.008
because y'all make
too much Noise.

01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:54.046
<i>I don't make as much Noise as
that, do I?</i>

01:00:56.415 --> 01:00:59.551
- Does he do that all night?
- Uh-huh.

01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:01.153
Make yourself comfortable.

01:01:01.186 --> 01:01:04.189
<i>Foul ball!</i>

01:01:04.223 --> 01:01:07.793
<i>Women, women, women!
Farbranch!</i>

01:01:09.295 --> 01:01:11.196
They made it to Farbranch.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.531
- Get the men ready.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:12.564 --> 01:01:16.502
<i>Sinner!
The Noise demands a martyr.</i>

01:01:16.535 --> 01:01:18.604
Where're you going,
preacher?

01:01:18.638 --> 01:01:20.439
<i>The angel waits!</i>

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.574
I'll fetch the girl.

01:01:22.608 --> 01:01:25.544
No. My men
can take care of that.

01:01:26.545 --> 01:01:28.314
I don't want her
torn to pieces.

01:01:29.281 --> 01:01:32.251
<i>Martyr! Judgment!</i>

01:01:33.252 --> 01:01:35.387
Follow him at a distance.

01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:36.889
Yep. Come on.

01:01:36.922 --> 01:01:38.190
<i>She won't get away.</i>

01:01:38.957 --> 01:01:40.292
<i>Sins!</i>

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:46.031
<i>If I don't contact them soon,</i>

01:01:46.065 --> 01:01:48.467
<i>they won't land
and I'll be stranded.</i>

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.336
<i>She hates it here.</i>

01:01:51.236 --> 01:01:54.273
<i>Don't blame her.</i>

01:01:54.306 --> 01:01:56.608
<i>Gonna leave me
and go be with them.</i>

01:01:58.544 --> 01:02:00.379
<i>I won't see her again.</i>

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.229
- Can't sleep?
- No.

01:02:17.262 --> 01:02:18.897
Yeah, me neither.

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:30.242
What's that?

01:02:32.411 --> 01:02:33.946
My mom's journal.

01:02:36.348 --> 01:02:39.051
Ben must've put it in
my bag for me to have.

01:02:40.386 --> 01:02:41.954
What's it say?

01:02:41.987 --> 01:02:43.589
I don't know.
Doesn't matter.

01:02:44.691 --> 01:02:46.358
You don't wanna know
about your mother?

01:02:48.994 --> 01:02:52.164
She died when I was
a baby, so...

01:02:52.197 --> 01:02:54.600
So? You can still know
what she was like.

01:02:54.634 --> 01:02:56.268
<i>Dead, she's dead.</i>

01:02:56.301 --> 01:02:58.170
That's what she's like.

01:02:58.203 --> 01:02:59.471
I lost my parents, too,

01:02:59.505 --> 01:03:00.939
you don't see me
yelling about it.

01:03:00.973 --> 01:03:02.040
I'm not yelling about it.

01:03:02.074 --> 01:03:03.108
<i>This is yelling!</i>

01:03:03.142 --> 01:03:04.343
Sorry.

01:03:07.346 --> 01:03:09.148
It's just
I would give anything

01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:12.151
to have something that kept
my parents alive for me.

01:03:12.184 --> 01:03:13.419
Yeah, well,
maybe I would, too.

01:03:13.452 --> 01:03:16.021
You do. You have it.
The book's right there.

01:03:16.054 --> 01:03:17.489
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:03:17.523 --> 01:03:19.258
Because I can't read,
Viola.

01:03:25.464 --> 01:03:28.967
Aaron burned all the books
when we were kids.

01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:33.071
He thought that being
born with the Noise

01:03:33.105 --> 01:03:35.541
was enough
of an education.

01:03:35.574 --> 01:03:39.945
<i>Only Noise
can be light in the darkness.</i>

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:43.449
I could read some to you
if you'd like.

01:03:47.019 --> 01:03:48.020
Please.

01:03:55.427 --> 01:03:57.429
It says "K.H."

01:03:59.398 --> 01:04:01.166
Karyssa.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.568
It's beautiful.

01:04:04.436 --> 01:04:06.706
Okay.

01:04:06.739 --> 01:04:10.442
"My dearest Todd,
my dearest son.

01:04:10.476 --> 01:04:13.412
"I begin this journal
on the day of your birth.

01:04:13.445 --> 01:04:14.647
"You're the most
beautiful thing

"I've seen on New World.

01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:18.785
"With you in my arms,
it feels like

"this planet is made
entirely out of hope."

<i>...planet is made
entirely out of hope.</i>

01:04:24.523 --> 01:04:26.726
"I wish your pa were here
to see you.

01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:29.796
"But the Lord saw fit
to take him.

"You look like him.

01:04:32.164 --> 01:04:34.667
"You're going to be tall,
strong, and handsome.

01:04:36.703 --> 01:04:39.071
"The ladies of New World
won't know what hit 'em."

01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:51.350
"There's a man
named David Prentiss

01:04:51.383 --> 01:04:53.519
"who convinced us all
to found a settlement

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.054
"on the far side of the swamp

01:04:56.088 --> 01:04:57.724
"so that the Noise
from the rest of New World

"won't reach us.

01:05:03.796 --> 01:05:06.833
"Prentiss seems so full
of secrets and shame,

01:05:06.866 --> 01:05:09.501
"and this place
doesn't allow that.

01:05:09.535 --> 01:05:11.537
"He's better at making
his Noise disappear

<i>I'm the circle,
the circle is me.</i>

01:05:19.378 --> 01:05:22.414
<i>And you,

01:05:23.783 --> 01:05:26.385
"It's so loud here,
all the time.

01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:28.721
"The men can't stand women
knowing everything about them,

01:05:28.755 --> 01:05:31.758
"and them not knowing
anything about us."

<i>Exceptional men are needed</i>

the circle together.</i>

What's next,
what happened?

That's it,
that's her last entry.

It wasn't the Spackle.

01:06:40.459 --> 01:06:42.294
The men killed the women.

<i>Unwanted. Weak.</i>

01:06:51.536 --> 01:06:52.772
<i>Killed my mom.</i>

<i>Do you just believe
everything that guy says?</i>

01:06:53.438 --> 01:06:54.573
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

01:06:54.606 --> 01:06:55.540
<i>Killed my mom
and killed all those women.</i>

01:06:55.574 --> 01:06:57.209
<i>The mayor
is not your friend.</i>

- <i>Todd!</i>

Leave all this.

Get the kids to the barn.

Don't go in
without a weapon!

01:07:49.227 --> 01:07:50.663
To the south!
Check the doors!

01:07:50.697 --> 01:07:51.731
Go down
into the basement!

01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:52.799
Nothin' left!

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:56.703
Sit there. Wait inside.

01:07:56.736 --> 01:07:59.604
You gotta go to your dad.
Bill, take your kid!

01:08:00.505 --> 01:08:01.406
Close all the doors!

01:08:03.776 --> 01:08:05.377
Move!

01:08:08.513 --> 01:08:09.782
<i>Viola.</i>

01:08:35.707 --> 01:08:36.743
Hildy.

01:08:36.776 --> 01:08:38.778
David.

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:40.947
You have a lot of gall
coming here.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:43.348
The law says any
Prentisstown man we catch

01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:44.884
gets the rope.

01:08:45.852 --> 01:08:47.720
Funny.

01:08:47.754 --> 01:08:50.756
I didn't see young Todd out
on the gallows as we rode in.

01:09:00.365 --> 01:09:01.500
He here?

01:09:02.868 --> 01:09:04.402
Read my mind.

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:08.473
We're simply here
for the girl.

01:09:08.506 --> 01:09:09.942
We now have
a common enemy.

01:09:11.778 --> 01:09:15.613
I'm not handing over a woman
to any man of Prentisstown.

01:09:19.384 --> 01:09:21.453
She's not a victim,
she's a spy.

01:09:23.522 --> 01:09:24.924
Come from a new ship,

01:09:27.059 --> 01:09:29.662
here to steal
everything you have.

01:09:29.694 --> 01:09:32.497
Your land,
the fields you toil and sweat over

01:09:32.531 --> 01:09:35.701
endless day
after endless day,

01:09:35.734 --> 01:09:38.104
but we're gonna take
their ship before it takes us.

01:09:38.136 --> 01:09:39.671
And the good people
of Farbranch

01:09:39.705 --> 01:09:42.041
are more than welcome
to join us.

01:09:42.073 --> 01:09:44.341
But I need that girl
before she warns them.

01:09:44.376 --> 01:09:45.711
Not this time.

01:09:46.845 --> 01:09:48.613
You're a liar!

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.968
Hello?

01:10:16.809 --> 01:10:18.077
Hey.

01:10:18.744 --> 01:10:20.612
It's okay.

01:10:20.646 --> 01:10:21.948
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

01:10:22.882 --> 01:10:24.382
Hildy sent me.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:26.819
<i>I'll get the girl,</i>

01:10:26.853 --> 01:10:28.054
<i>bring her to Prentiss.</i>

01:10:29.655 --> 01:10:31.489
I'll ask you once.

01:10:31.523 --> 01:10:34.727
Put down your weapons,
this isn't a fair fight.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.730
We'll show no mercy to anyone
who stands in our way.

01:10:37.763 --> 01:10:39.531
Remember
who he is.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.035
Don't let him get
in your head.

01:10:43.069 --> 01:10:46.072
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me."</i>

01:10:46.105 --> 01:10:48.506
<i>We can't win.
Surrender.</i>

01:10:50.142 --> 01:10:52.712
<i>Not worth the fight.
No choice.</i>

01:11:01.486 --> 01:11:02.755
What is it?
What is it?

01:11:02.788 --> 01:11:04.556
<i>Save her, save her. Viola.</i>

01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:12.031
The hell happened?

01:11:15.801 --> 01:11:18.037
You ready?

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:19.171
<i>Damn,
she kicked his ass.</i>

01:11:19.205 --> 01:11:21.539
- Todd?
- Yeah, yeah, let's go.

01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:23.575
This way.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:32.584
<i>We're comin' for ya!</i>

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:46.431
<i>Angel!</i>

01:11:48.067 --> 01:11:49.936
<i>Martyr! Judgment!</i>

01:11:52.905 --> 01:11:54.539
<i>You cannot be saved!</i>

01:11:56.175 --> 01:11:57.843
Drop it!

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.114
Okay, okay.

01:12:02.148 --> 01:12:04.050
<i>Sin rots the soul.</i>

01:12:04.083 --> 01:12:06.118
- <i>Weak.</i>
- Get down!

01:12:08.955 --> 01:12:10.022
<i>Coward!</i>

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.096
No, no!

01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:19.265
Keep your head down!

01:12:19.298 --> 01:12:20.900
<i>I'm scared.</i>

01:12:20.933 --> 01:12:22.802
<i>Is it Second Wave?</i>

01:12:22.835 --> 01:12:24.602
<i>Finally got her.</i>

01:12:25.771 --> 01:12:26.806
<i>Got you now.</i>

01:12:32.577 --> 01:12:35.014
This is your chance
to save the boy's life.

01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:38.117
Bring me the girl

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:40.252
and I promise no harm
will come to your son.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.755
<i>You can save him.</i>

01:12:43.222 --> 01:12:44.589
Where is he?

01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:47.093
Right in there.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.162
Todd!

01:12:50.196 --> 01:12:52.198
- <i>Ben. Is that Ben?</i>
- Son! Are you here?

01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:54.532
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

01:12:54.566 --> 01:12:56.035
Todd? Todd.

01:12:56.469 --> 01:12:57.703
- Hey.
- Whoa.

01:12:57.737 --> 01:12:58.771
Son.

01:12:58.804 --> 01:12:59.939
Todd!

01:13:01.974 --> 01:13:04.542
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:13:06.846 --> 01:13:07.847
Ben...

01:13:09.815 --> 01:13:11.183
I read the journal.

01:13:18.024 --> 01:13:19.557
<i>I say we smoke him out.</i>

01:13:19.591 --> 01:13:20.993
<i>He can't go nowhere.</i>

01:13:21.427 --> 01:13:23.729
<i>No more games.</i>

01:13:23.763 --> 01:13:24.964
Time's running out!

01:13:24.997 --> 01:13:27.599
<i>She's gonna die.</i>

01:13:28.868 --> 01:13:30.036
You've got one more minute!

01:13:30.069 --> 01:13:32.604
<i>Shoot her out
so we can get her outta here.</i>

01:13:34.907 --> 01:13:36.242
We couldn't do anything, son.

01:13:37.176 --> 01:13:38.610
We tried.

01:13:38.644 --> 01:13:41.113
But it was chaos.

01:13:41.147 --> 01:13:44.683
The best we could do
was keep you safe.

01:13:49.021 --> 01:13:51.623
How could you keep this
from me?

01:13:51.657 --> 01:13:53.959
- No. No.
- My whole life you lied to me.

01:13:53.993 --> 01:13:56.195
No, we thought
we could protect you.

01:13:57.797 --> 01:13:58.931
That's not protecting me,

01:13:58.964 --> 01:14:00.666
- that's lying to me.
- I'm sorry.

01:14:00.699 --> 01:14:02.268
Let me protect you now.

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:12.211
Let me go in there
and get the girl.

01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:13.646
I can get her out.

01:14:14.046 --> 01:14:15.114
Hey.

01:14:15.147 --> 01:14:16.916
Hey!

01:14:16.949 --> 01:14:19.118
<i>I'm sorry, Pa.
I'm sorry.</i>

01:14:27.193 --> 01:14:29.695
Whoa.
I got it. I got it.

01:14:46.178 --> 01:14:47.680
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:14:47.713 --> 01:14:49.782
<i>I don't trust him,
I don't trust him.</i>

01:14:56.889 --> 01:14:59.058
Thank you, Ben.

01:14:59.091 --> 01:15:00.793
I knew I could rely on you.

01:15:20.112 --> 01:15:22.414
- <i>What's she gonna do?</i>
- Got you now, girl.

01:15:22.448 --> 01:15:24.450
<i>What's she gonna do?</i>

01:15:24.483 --> 01:15:26.285
Pleasure to see you again,
young lady.

01:15:27.253 --> 01:15:30.322
I wish it was
under better circumstances.

01:15:53.045 --> 01:15:54.380
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

01:15:54.413 --> 01:15:56.982
- <i>Preacher!
- Come on. Come on!</i>

01:15:57.016 --> 01:15:58.450
Go! Come on!

01:15:58.484 --> 01:16:00.386
<i>I have been
shown the river</i>

01:16:00.419 --> 01:16:02.288
<i>that is the water of life!</i>

01:16:10.029 --> 01:16:11.330
Viola, get in the boat!

01:16:15.034 --> 01:16:16.235
Get in the boat!

01:16:16.268 --> 01:16:18.437
- Todd, I can't swim!
- You won't have to, get in!

01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:26.879
Come on!

01:16:26.912 --> 01:16:28.747
<i>Go, go. Go, go, go!</i>

01:16:32.985 --> 01:16:34.253
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

01:16:34.286 --> 01:16:38.224
<i>And he was thrown
into the lake of fire!</i>

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:43.829
Hyah!

01:16:47.066 --> 01:16:48.500
Hyah!

01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:00.179
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

01:17:01.847 --> 01:17:03.015
No, no, no, no, no!

01:17:28.907 --> 01:17:30.109
Viola!

01:17:34.179 --> 01:17:35.481
No!

01:17:37.383 --> 01:17:38.417
<i>Martyr!</i>

01:17:38.817 --> 01:17:41.020
Todd! Todd!

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:46.792
Todd, Todd!

01:17:52.931 --> 01:17:54.466
<i>Manchee!</i>

01:17:57.102 --> 01:17:59.438
- Manchee!
- Todd!

01:18:00.139 --> 01:18:01.840
Viola!

01:18:03.075 --> 01:18:04.910
Viola! Swim to the boat!

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.095
Grab my hand. I got you.

01:18:24.997 --> 01:18:26.398
Grab the boat.

01:18:27.599 --> 01:18:29.001
Come on.

01:18:29.034 --> 01:18:30.302
Manchee!

01:18:32.237 --> 01:18:33.472
Manchee! Manchee!

01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:35.507
Aaron! Aaron, don't!

01:18:35.541 --> 01:18:37.042
No!

01:18:39.178 --> 01:18:40.279
Todd, no!

01:18:40.647 --> 01:18:42.314
Todd, no!

01:18:45.451 --> 01:18:46.885
Aaron!

01:18:46.919 --> 01:18:49.388
No! No! No!

01:18:50.289 --> 01:18:51.357
No!

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:12.177
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,</i>

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:14.146
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:19:14.179 --> 01:19:15.381
<i>Dead. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:19:15.414 --> 01:19:16.515
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:17.616
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:18.984
<i>Gone, dead. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:19:19.017 --> 01:19:20.152
<i>He's dead. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:19:20.185 --> 01:19:22.521
<i>Manchee. My Manchee's gone.
Dead. Stop!</i>

01:19:22.554 --> 01:19:25.524
<i>Be tough. Crying's weak.
Stop! Todd, stop it!</i>

01:19:25.557 --> 01:19:28.026
<i>Be tough, be tough.
Manchee, Manchee.</i>

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.529
<i>Be tough. Dead. Shut up, Todd.
Come on, be a man.</i>

01:19:30.562 --> 01:19:31.964
<i>Everything dies.</i>

01:19:37.102 --> 01:19:38.270
I'm so sorry, Todd.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.908
<i>It's just a dog.</i>

01:19:50.983 --> 01:19:53.485
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt. Kill him.</i>

01:19:53.519 --> 01:19:55.621
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt. Kill him.</i>

01:19:58.123 --> 01:19:59.692
<i>Dead. Death.</i>

01:20:04.731 --> 01:20:05.931
Fine.

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:16.575
Todd!

01:20:18.243 --> 01:20:19.378
Todd!

01:20:29.188 --> 01:20:31.023
This way
looks more built up.

01:20:31.056 --> 01:20:32.991
It must be the way to Haven.

01:20:40.365 --> 01:20:41.600
I've seen these,

01:20:41.634 --> 01:20:44.002
on infrastructure plans
on the ship.

01:20:44.036 --> 01:20:46.138
They're supports
for a monorail.

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:15.501
<i>Stop! Be a man.</i>

01:21:15.534 --> 01:21:17.402
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:21:17.436 --> 01:21:18.604
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:21:18.638 --> 01:21:20.773
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:21:20.807 --> 01:21:22.709
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:21:22.742 --> 01:21:24.543
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:21:29.481 --> 01:21:30.650
I liked him.

01:21:33.485 --> 01:21:35.153
Yeah, me too.

01:21:36.288 --> 01:21:38.090
He was the best dog
I ever knew.

01:21:39.826 --> 01:21:41.794
He was the only dog
you ever knew.

01:22:08.721 --> 01:22:10.589
You're a good man,
Todd Hewitt.

01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:19.164
I'm not gonna kiss you.

01:22:20.198 --> 01:22:21.834
I wasn't thinking...

01:22:41.153 --> 01:22:44.556
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:46.491
<i>"I am the circle...</i>

01:22:48.427 --> 01:22:51.864
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

01:23:19.191 --> 01:23:21.393
It's an old
Expansion Class ship.

01:23:21.426 --> 01:23:23.362
A lot like mine,
only first generation.

01:23:24.931 --> 01:23:26.264
<i>Whoa.</i>

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:34.172
Careful! This ship goes down
another three or four levels.

01:23:34.206 --> 01:23:35.675
This is the wing.

01:23:40.913 --> 01:23:43.315
This must be
what my family came here on.

01:23:57.529 --> 01:23:59.364
Todd, look.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.976
<i>Gotta keep goin'.
Not far behind.</i>

01:24:10.009 --> 01:24:11.309
We gotta keep moving.

01:24:11.944 --> 01:24:12.979
We gotta get to Haven.

01:24:13.012 --> 01:24:15.480
No, there isn't time.

01:24:15.514 --> 01:24:17.582
There's an emergency
transmitter two floors down.

01:24:17.616 --> 01:24:19.217
If it still works,
I can use it.

01:24:26.625 --> 01:24:28.260
You okay?

01:24:28.293 --> 01:24:30.362
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:36.268
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:39.939
<i>Cool. This is cool.</i>

01:24:39.972 --> 01:24:41.741
What's all this?

01:24:41.774 --> 01:24:43.743
Cryo-chambers for horses.

01:24:43.776 --> 01:24:45.310
There's a horse in here?

01:24:45.343 --> 01:24:47.379
There were horses in here.

01:24:47.412 --> 01:24:48.648
It's how they all got here.

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:54.286
That is so cool.

01:24:55.722 --> 01:24:57.222
This way.

01:25:03.328 --> 01:25:04.964
You're all right.

01:25:25.084 --> 01:25:27.586
<i>Lost. She's lost.</i>

01:26:16.535 --> 01:26:18.403
<i>I don't want her to leave.</i>

01:26:18.436 --> 01:26:20.605
<i>She's gonna go home,
she's gone.</i>

01:26:21.573 --> 01:26:22.574
Okay.

01:26:23.176 --> 01:26:25.477
<i>Bye. This is goodbye.</i>

01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:27.579
<i>Ask her, go on.
Just ask her.</i>

01:26:30.917 --> 01:26:31.951
No!

01:26:33.085 --> 01:26:34.486
What?

01:26:36.856 --> 01:26:38.724
The antenna's
broken off.

01:26:44.396 --> 01:26:46.498
We were so close.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.135
If you get everything ready
down here,

01:26:49.168 --> 01:26:51.369
I could probably climb it.

01:26:51.403 --> 01:26:52.672
<i>Help her.</i>

01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:55.540
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:26:56.843 --> 01:26:58.644
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

01:26:58.678 --> 01:26:59.912
All right.

01:27:09.722 --> 01:27:10.990
Boy's inside.

01:27:12.825 --> 01:27:13.993
And the girl?

01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:17.596
I didn't see her.

01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:19.397
Surround the ship
and wait for my order.

01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:27.807
<i>We gotta get her home.</i>

01:27:31.811 --> 01:27:33.378
<i>Shit.</i>

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.414
<i>Breathe.</i>

01:27:36.849 --> 01:27:37.950
<i>Then go.</i>

01:27:40.552 --> 01:27:43.689
Okay. I got it. I got it.

01:27:43.723 --> 01:27:46.524
<i>Come on, Todd.
You got this.</i>

01:27:49.195 --> 01:27:50.997
<i>Don't look down. Whoa!</i>

01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:52.665
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

01:28:06.112 --> 01:28:07.512
<i>Get her home.</i>

01:28:48.654 --> 01:28:51.023
<i>Closing in.
This is it.</i>

01:28:51.057 --> 01:28:52.490
<i>I hope this works.</i>

01:28:54.927 --> 01:28:56.062
<i>Please work.</i>

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.070
<i>Sacrifice!</i>

01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:07.539
Give up!

01:29:07.572 --> 01:29:09.976
Todd Hewitt!

01:29:11.677 --> 01:29:15.281
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

01:29:15.314 --> 01:29:17.183
<i>How're we gonna
find him in there?</i>

01:29:17.216 --> 01:29:18.985
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

01:29:20.786 --> 01:29:23.189
Time to show yourself, son.

01:29:23.222 --> 01:29:25.124
Or I'm gonna shoot Ben.

01:29:25.157 --> 01:29:27.893
No! Don't listen
to him, Todd!

01:29:33.598 --> 01:29:34.467
Let go!

01:29:34.499 --> 01:29:35.801
<i>You murderer!</i>

01:29:35.835 --> 01:29:38.603
I showed those women no mercy.

01:29:40.139 --> 01:29:43.676
I couldn't tell the voice
of God from the Noise.

01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:45.543
<i>I am the sinner!</i>

01:29:45.577 --> 01:29:47.545
<i>Kill me!</i>

01:29:47.579 --> 01:29:49.115
Kill me.

01:29:53.585 --> 01:29:55.587
<i>Purify my sin!</i>

01:29:58.024 --> 01:29:59.624
Purify me!

01:30:00.826 --> 01:30:03.229
<i>Kill me!</i>

01:30:06.032 --> 01:30:07.666
<i>I am the sinner!</i>

01:30:08.934 --> 01:30:11.937
<i>I am baptized with fire!</i>

01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:13.305
No! No! No!

01:30:13.339 --> 01:30:15.341
<i>Atone.</i>

01:30:15.374 --> 01:30:18.576
<i>Atone. Atone. Atone.</i>

01:30:20.079 --> 01:30:21.781
<i>Atone. Atone.</i>

01:30:23.082 --> 01:30:25.684
<i>I am the sinner!</i>

01:30:29.822 --> 01:30:31.290
<i>Atone.</i>

01:30:58.751 --> 01:31:01.087
<i>I know what he did.
You're a murderer.</i>

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.321
<i>Todd.</i>

01:31:10.796 --> 01:31:11.897
Where is she?

01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:14.333
Let him go.

01:31:15.668 --> 01:31:17.937
Todd, where is the girl?

01:31:19.338 --> 01:31:21.340
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:31:21.373 --> 01:31:22.741
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:31:22.775 --> 01:31:24.076
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd...</i>

01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:25.311
No, wait!

01:31:25.344 --> 01:31:26.679
Ben!

01:31:29.815 --> 01:31:31.616
Ben!
You son of a bitch!

01:31:32.885 --> 01:31:33.953
You're all right,
you're all right.

01:31:33.986 --> 01:31:35.087
You're all right.
I'm right here.

01:31:35.121 --> 01:31:36.722
- Okay? You're all good.
- I'm so sorry.

01:31:36.755 --> 01:31:37.957
- I know, it's okay.
- I'm sorry,

01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:39.258
we shouldn't have lied to you.

01:31:39.291 --> 01:31:40.826
I know, it's all right,
it's all right.

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.828
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm here. I'm here.

01:31:44.763 --> 01:31:47.266
If you want a real long
goodbye with your father,

01:31:47.299 --> 01:31:48.968
you should
give me the girl.

01:31:49.001 --> 01:31:50.836
- I'm right here.
- We should've stood up to him.

01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:52.138
I know, I know.

01:31:52.171 --> 01:31:54.406
Just relax!
Just lie down. Ben.

01:31:56.876 --> 01:31:58.777
<i>Keep him safe, Ben.
Keep him safe.</i>

01:31:58.811 --> 01:32:00.779
<i>Protect...</i>

01:32:00.813 --> 01:32:02.681
That girl
is using you, Todd.

01:32:03.315 --> 01:32:04.817
She hates you.

01:32:06.152 --> 01:32:07.786
She hates your Noise.

01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:24.870
<i>Where's my knife?</i>

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.141
<i>Yes.</i>

01:32:43.789 --> 01:32:45.991
Did you hear that?

01:32:46.025 --> 01:32:48.427
She just called them!

01:32:53.899 --> 01:32:57.469
Four thousand people
on their way to destroy us.

01:33:00.272 --> 01:33:01.941
Are you happy now, Todd?

01:33:03.008 --> 01:33:04.977
Huh? You think you won?

01:33:12.785 --> 01:33:14.253
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:33:14.286 --> 01:33:15.854
You think
you can hide from me, Todd?

01:33:15.888 --> 01:33:17.122
<i>Fight. Shut up.</i>

01:33:17.156 --> 01:33:19.425
Been hearing your Noise
since you were born.

01:33:26.298 --> 01:33:28.968
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt. Quiet.</i>

01:33:29.001 --> 01:33:30.836
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:33:33.339 --> 01:33:35.474
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:33:36.242 --> 01:33:38.010
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:33:38.043 --> 01:33:39.378
<i>Shut up!
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:33:39.411 --> 01:33:41.247
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.449

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

01:33:48.053 --> 01:33:49.288
<i>He killed my mom.</i>

01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:57.363
<i>Your Noise
is your power.</i>

01:33:58.397 --> 01:34:02.067
<i>Your Noise could've been
your power, Todd.</i>

01:34:02.101 --> 01:34:04.203
<i>Power! Noise.</i>

01:34:04.236 --> 01:34:06.205
<i>Power.</i>

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:10.876
<i>Could've been your power,
Todd. Noise.</i>

01:34:12.945 --> 01:34:15.314
You're not a killer, Todd.

01:34:17.916 --> 01:34:19.551
It's just not in your blood.

01:34:20.919 --> 01:34:22.488
It's in mine.

01:34:22.521 --> 01:34:25.491
<i>♪ Early one morning</i>

01:34:25.524 --> 01:34:29.061
<i>♪ Just as the Sun was rising</i>

01:34:29.094 --> 01:34:35.067
<i>♪ I heard a young maid sing</i>
<i>From the valley below ♪</i>

01:34:37.336 --> 01:34:39.505
<i>Look at what you did to me.</i>

01:34:50.316 --> 01:34:53.585
<i>You taught those men to kill.</i>

01:34:53.619 --> 01:34:55.988
<i>Because you couldn't stand
the thought of all those women</i>

01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:58.223
<i>seeing you
for what you really are.</i>

01:35:03.962 --> 01:35:05.464
And what is that?

01:35:06.365 --> 01:35:08.000
<i>A coward.</i>

01:35:08.033 --> 01:35:09.401
<i>A coward.</i>

01:35:10.202 --> 01:35:12.204
<i>A coward. A coward.</i>

01:35:12.237 --> 01:35:13.472
<i>Coward! Coward!</i>

01:35:13.505 --> 01:35:15.374
<i>You taught
all those men to kill.</i>

01:35:15.407 --> 01:35:17.409
<i>The only thing
you're good for, David.</i>

01:35:17.443 --> 01:35:20.079
<i>Look
at what you did to me.</i>

01:35:20.112 --> 01:35:22.147
- <i>Kill to survive.</i>
- <i>Look at what you did!</i>

01:35:22.181 --> 01:35:24.416
- <i>You murderer!</i>
- <i>Turn around!</i>

01:35:25.617 --> 01:35:27.419
<i>You killed us all!</i>

01:35:27.453 --> 01:35:30.556
<i>Seeing you for just
what you are, a coward.</i>

01:35:44.169 --> 01:35:46.171
Todd.

01:35:50.509 --> 01:35:51.610
Todd.

01:35:52.712 --> 01:35:54.613
Todd.

01:35:54.647 --> 01:35:57.082
It's okay, I'm here. Todd.

01:35:57.116 --> 01:35:59.084
No, no. I'm here.

01:36:15.501 --> 01:36:16.969
They're here.

01:36:28.748 --> 01:36:31.216
Get the hell out of here!
We gotta go. Run!

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:32.551
We did it.

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.155
No, no. I'm here.

01:36:36.188 --> 01:36:37.356
We did it.

01:36:39.291 --> 01:36:40.559
We did it.

01:36:52.037 --> 01:36:53.673
<i>I'm alive.</i>

01:36:57.376 --> 01:37:01.146

01:37:09.321 --> 01:37:11.557
<i>I'm alive. How am I alive?</i>

01:37:15.494 --> 01:37:16.962
Hey.

01:37:18.665 --> 01:37:21.967
<i>Viola. She's here.
Viola's here.</i>

01:37:22.702 --> 01:37:24.336
Where else would I be?

01:37:27.807 --> 01:37:29.676
You okay?

01:37:30.375 --> 01:37:32.077
Yeah.

01:37:32.110 --> 01:37:33.479
You've been out for days.

01:37:37.483 --> 01:37:39.451
Where are we?

01:37:39.485 --> 01:37:41.688
- My ship.
- <i>Ship.</i>

01:37:41.721 --> 01:37:43.690
<i>Her ship. Her ship?</i>

01:37:59.171 --> 01:38:01.440
<i>People. Her people.</i>

01:38:01.473 --> 01:38:03.242
<i>It's the Second Wave.</i>

01:38:04.409 --> 01:38:05.778
So you're staying?

01:38:05.812 --> 01:38:08.046
Yeah.

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.816
<i>They made me promise
I would make it here.</i>

01:38:09.849 --> 01:38:12.150
<i>Find a better life.</i>

01:38:12.184 --> 01:38:14.152
<i>It's not exactly
what I'd imagined.</i>

01:38:16.388 --> 01:38:18.791
It's growing on me.

01:38:18.825 --> 01:38:20.425
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

01:38:21.861 --> 01:38:23.595
You think
it'll grow on them, too?

01:38:25.364 --> 01:38:26.666
We'll show them.

01:38:29.836 --> 01:38:31.403
