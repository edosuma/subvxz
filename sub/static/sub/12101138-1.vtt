00:17.122 --> 00:18.890
<i>Good morning,
Southern California.</i>

00:18.957 --> 00:20.292
<i>It's 8:00,
and it's going to be</i>

00:20.358 --> 00:22.026
<i>another beautiful day
in Palm Springs.</i>

00:22.092 --> 00:23.961
<i>It's your girl Frankie J,</i>

00:24.028 --> 00:26.631
<i>and thank you for listening
to your favorite radio station.</i>

00:32.369 --> 00:33.737
<i>Look at you.</i>

00:33.803 --> 00:35.971
<i>Such a dirty girl.</i>

00:36.071 --> 00:40.410
<i>A good shower before
a wild ride is all you need.</i>

00:43.912 --> 00:45.813
<i>You make heads turn.</i>

00:45.913 --> 00:49.718
<i>I like that.</i>

01:06.633 --> 01:07.965
- Hi, Victor!
- Hi!

01:20.611 --> 01:22.946
<i>In local news,
Major Victor Martin</i>

01:23.013 --> 01:26.483
<i>won the Sweet Ride
Antique Roadster division.</i>

01:26.516 --> 01:27.850
<i>Way to go, Major.</i>

01:27.917 --> 01:29.319
<i>Your local news
is brought to you</i>

01:29.353 --> 01:31.288

<i>Stop by and check out
their famous strudel</i>

01:33.289 --> 01:34.956
<i>and art gallery.</i>

01:48.435 --> 01:50.203
Hey, Victor!

01:50.270 --> 01:54.207
Sal, what are you doing
with all those old people?

01:55.709 --> 01:59.278
We learned how to do
papier-mâché.

02:12.823 --> 02:14.692
It's good for you.

02:14.725 --> 02:16.560
It stretches the hips,
everything.

02:16.627 --> 02:18.228
Let's go.

02:26.034 --> 02:28.236
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

02:28.303 --> 02:30.138
Nice car.

02:30.204 --> 02:32.408
Nice Chihuahua.

02:45.318 --> 02:47.421
What? Why don't you
sell it?

02:47.487 --> 02:50.022
I can't hear you!
Turn that thing down!

02:50.089 --> 02:52.558
You're too old for that car,
gringo.

02:52.591 --> 02:53.859
Why don't you sell it to me?

02:53.925 --> 02:55.728
How about never?

02:55.761 --> 02:57.263
Man, a man your age

02:57.363 --> 02:59.265
should be zipping around
on one of them scooter things.

02:59.365 --> 03:02.232
- Do you know that guy?
- No.

03:02.267 --> 03:05.370
What do they call a cholo
who drives an Impala?

03:05.437 --> 03:06.871
Small theft auto.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.447
Yeah?

03:17.513 --> 03:19.582
What was it like growing up
riding dinosaurs?

03:19.615 --> 03:21.116
Good one.

03:21.216 --> 03:23.084
Yo, why do you still drive
that thing anyway?

03:23.118 --> 03:25.119
You can't even
get it up anymore.

03:25.186 --> 03:29.257
Listen to that big,
bad hombre.

03:30.191 --> 03:31.760
You want to see me get it up?

03:31.792 --> 03:34.295
Sure. If you got what it takes.

03:35.396 --> 03:36.963
All right,
let's do this.

03:49.475 --> 03:50.943
Yeah!

04:13.228 --> 04:15.731
Oh, boy.

04:18.099 --> 04:20.167
Victor, Victor, Victor.

04:20.234 --> 04:21.603
I guess it's true
what they say:

04:21.669 --> 04:23.237
you can't teach an old dog
new tricks.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.906
That son of a bitch
set me up.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.941
All right, I want you
to look me in the eyes

04:27.007 --> 04:28.275
when I tell you this.

04:28.342 --> 04:29.643
I'm looking.
You got great eyes.

04:29.676 --> 04:31.411
Doesn't she got beautiful eyes?

04:31.478 --> 04:33.413
- Yeah, you got beautiful eyes.
- Guys, I'm serious.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.282
I know you like your ride,
but it's got to stop.

04:35.349 --> 04:37.015
This new DA
means business.

04:37.082 --> 04:38.618
She's cracking down big time
on you seniors.

04:38.684 --> 04:40.085
She's cracking down.

04:40.151 --> 04:42.989
Fail to use your turn signal,
you get a ticket.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.756
Driving too slow, ticket.
You know how it is.

04:44.823 --> 04:46.056
Pick your friends,
pick your nose,

04:46.123 --> 04:47.492
Can't pick your friend's nose.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.027
- What?
- Promise me, Victor,

04:50.127 --> 04:52.161
no more shenanigans.

04:52.195 --> 04:53.864
No more shenanigans,
I get to pick your nose.

04:53.964 --> 04:55.666
- Yeah, yeah.
- Victor...

04:55.699 --> 04:57.535
Thanks for the heads-up, Nancy.

05:02.272 --> 05:05.140
Like two hard-boiled eggs
doing the salsa, mm.

05:09.378 --> 05:11.212
Hello, Billy.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.047
- Sonia, honey...
- Hm?

05:13.114 --> 05:15.317
...can I get another slice
of that strudel, please?

05:15.384 --> 05:16.817
Are you sure?

05:16.884 --> 05:18.553
Oh, I can't get enough.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.288
Let me see if Caroline
is still baking.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.055
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.825
Billy wants more.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.994
Ooh, sorry.

05:49.078 --> 05:51.481
Oh, it's gorgeous.

05:51.548 --> 05:52.983
Thanks somewhat.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.184
It's for the auction.

05:55.252 --> 05:58.688
Oh, I don't know
how to thank you.

05:58.754 --> 06:00.188
Mwah.

06:04.759 --> 06:06.428
Big day, Victor.

06:06.528 --> 06:09.931
Today you made it
on the cover of <i>Sweet Ride.</i>

06:09.998 --> 06:12.333
You never done that before,
have you?

06:12.399 --> 06:14.935
- No, it's the first time, man.
- Yeah.

06:15.035 --> 06:17.404
I mean,
I'm so excited.

06:37.588 --> 06:39.090
I like to make
the guys jealous.

06:39.122 --> 06:40.458
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:40.524 --> 06:42.125
You'll have a great time.

06:42.192 --> 06:43.960
- I'll try to come.
- Really? All right.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.262
Look. Now, right in there.

06:46.296 --> 06:48.098
Oh, that's a good one.

06:48.130 --> 06:50.233
Oh! I think I'm getting aroused.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.301
Good, she's a beautiful girl.

06:52.401 --> 06:53.902
I'm talking about the car.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.972
When's this going
to hit the stands?

06:57.039 --> 06:58.707
In August.

06:58.774 --> 07:00.173
August.

07:00.274 --> 07:01.743
That's around the corner.

07:01.809 --> 07:04.579
Holy shit.

07:04.646 --> 07:06.481
What is that?

07:06.581 --> 07:08.715
Oh, that's Ted Garvin.

07:10.651 --> 07:13.487
There's no way
that that's Ted Garvin.

07:14.655 --> 07:17.890
That's because the last time
you saw him,

07:17.957 --> 07:20.893
he was cruising around
in his Caddy,

07:20.960 --> 07:22.495
puffing a Cuban.

07:22.561 --> 07:26.297
The picture of a happily
retired man.

07:27.465 --> 07:28.833
Jesus.

07:28.933 --> 07:30.068
What happened?

07:30.135 --> 07:32.069
Story I heard,

07:32.136 --> 07:34.738
he hit a kid on a bike.

07:34.805 --> 07:36.674
Months, maybe two months ago.

07:36.740 --> 07:41.144
Barely grazed him,
but the parents sued,

07:41.176 --> 07:44.179
and he wound up
losing his license, his car,

07:44.247 --> 07:46.181
and most of his hair.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.451
They took away his Caddy?

07:49.518 --> 07:51.185
Oh, Jesus.

07:57.992 --> 08:00.528
Look who's here.
Hey, honey!

08:07.867 --> 08:09.469
- Hey, baby!
- Hi.

08:09.536 --> 08:11.603
Oh, I'm so glad
you made it!

08:11.670 --> 08:14.006
Oh! Great!

08:14.039 --> 08:16.008
- Yeah.
- Danny, Mike.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.710
- Sal. Guys.
- Hey.

08:19.044 --> 08:21.179
Yeah, she's the model, man.

08:21.211 --> 08:22.880
The model.

08:26.718 --> 08:27.984
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:28.051 --> 08:30.187
welcome to Captain Hook's
piano bar.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.055
Put your hands together
and help me welcome up

08:32.122 --> 08:33.490
our unofficial host.

08:33.557 --> 08:36.058
He's calling me up.
I got to go.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.893
- Okay.
- Do us proud, Vic.

08:37.993 --> 08:39.161
Do us proud.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.063
Major Victor Martin!

08:43.732 --> 08:46.167
Hey! Hey!

08:46.234 --> 08:49.170
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.139
Yeah, this is our bar.
We love it here.

08:51.206 --> 08:55.210
We welcome you
to Captain Hook's bar,

08:55.242 --> 08:58.213
because once you come in,
you're hooked.

08:58.245 --> 09:00.346
And we reel you back in!

09:00.413 --> 09:03.182
Oh, yeah.

09:06.018 --> 09:07.753
- You miss me?
- Oh, so much.

09:10.655 --> 09:12.924
I can't believe
you got her number.

09:13.024 --> 09:15.228
I think she has the hots for me.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.928
Well, maybe.

09:18.028 --> 09:19.396
Danny and Mike,

09:19.430 --> 09:21.031
they almost had a heart attack.

09:26.035 --> 09:27.737
Hey!

09:27.771 --> 09:30.273
Ha, ha, ha.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.608
- Look who it is.
- Hey, sorry, old man. I couldn't resist.

09:32.674 --> 09:35.544
Cop was just waiting there
with a big old butterfly net.

09:35.611 --> 09:39.114
I'm glad somebody
got a laugh out of it.

09:39.181 --> 09:40.581
You want to do it for real
this time?

09:40.615 --> 09:43.017
- Get out of here, old man.
- Come on.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.619
Hey, you in, dipshit?

09:45.787 --> 09:46.954
Dipshit?

10:08.973 --> 10:10.375
Yeah!

10:27.224 --> 10:28.757
Yeah!

10:28.824 --> 10:30.226
Whoa!

10:34.963 --> 10:36.497
- Oh!
- Oh!

10:41.001 --> 10:42.770
Morons.

10:42.837 --> 10:45.104
I don't know
what happened.

10:46.606 --> 10:48.508
Oh! Oh!

10:50.443 --> 10:52.644
Are you okay?

10:52.678 --> 10:55.514
I'm too old
for this shit!

10:57.516 --> 10:59.650
Mr. Martin, I'm going to ask you
one more time.

10:59.684 --> 11:02.119
Are you waiving your right
to an attorney?

11:02.186 --> 11:04.355
Absolutely,
Your Honor.

11:04.422 --> 11:05.790
This is an open-and-shut case.

11:05.857 --> 11:07.924
I'm a pilot.
I know how to drive a car.

11:07.991 --> 11:10.261
Very well. Proceed.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.831
The defense calls, um...

11:14.865 --> 11:16.365
its first witness...

11:16.465 --> 11:19.535
Mr. Salvatore Giuseppe Spinelli.

11:19.602 --> 11:22.305
Mr. Spinelli, would you please
come forward?

11:23.938 --> 11:25.373
Your hat, sir.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.041
- Remove your hat, please.
- Oh.

11:27.108 --> 11:28.676
Place your right hand
on the Bible.

11:28.710 --> 11:31.045
Do you solemnly swear the
testimony you are about to give

11:31.145 --> 11:32.446
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

11:32.512 --> 11:34.349
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

11:34.381 --> 11:35.816
- I do.
- Be seated.

11:38.652 --> 11:40.052
Good afternoon,
Mr. Spinelli.

11:40.152 --> 11:42.889
Good afternoon, Mr. Martin.

11:42.955 --> 11:47.726
Mr. Spinelli, would you please
inform the court

11:47.826 --> 11:50.528
how long you've known
the defendant?

11:50.562 --> 11:54.499
Well, we met
at Carleton High.

11:54.566 --> 11:57.735
Freshman-year phys ed.

11:59.237 --> 12:02.506
In square dancing class.

12:02.573 --> 12:05.242
There weren't
enough girls,

12:05.342 --> 12:08.845
so the teacher
paired us up.

12:08.912 --> 12:11.314
And knowing the defendant as...

12:13.349 --> 12:15.751
Knowing the defendant
as well as you do...

12:17.019 --> 12:18.720
how would you describe
his character?

12:18.754 --> 12:21.390
What-What-What kind
of man is he?

12:21.422 --> 12:24.659
The bravest man I know.

12:26.060 --> 12:28.028
Fought in Nam.

12:28.094 --> 12:30.830
Tested jets for NASA.

12:30.897 --> 12:33.700
A true American hero.

12:33.767 --> 12:37.937
And the best damn friend
I could ever have hoped for,

12:38.003 --> 12:39.438
I'll tell you that.

12:40.572 --> 12:42.441
Thank you, Sal.

12:44.609 --> 12:46.577
How many times would you say
you've driven

12:46.611 --> 12:48.213
with the defendant?

12:48.280 --> 12:51.349
Too many to count!

12:51.416 --> 12:54.952
Way up in the thousands,
at least.

12:55.018 --> 12:56.853
Would you describe him
as reckless?

12:56.920 --> 12:58.121
No.

12:58.222 --> 13:00.122
Confident, maybe.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.959
But never reckless.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.565
This community
is attracting a younger crowd.

13:10.632 --> 13:13.068
And it is our priority...

13:13.134 --> 13:14.769
indeed our economic necessity...

13:14.803 --> 13:15.970
to welcome them.

13:17.305 --> 13:19.307
Drivers like Mr. Martin

13:19.407 --> 13:22.109
are ticking time bombs
on wheels.

13:22.142 --> 13:24.911
And I, for one,
don't want to wait around

13:24.978 --> 13:29.249
for these bombs to go off
and kill innocent people.

13:29.316 --> 13:32.951
So I'm here today to plead

13:32.985 --> 13:34.953
that the court
do whenever it can

13:34.987 --> 13:36.621
to defuse these bombs

13:36.655 --> 13:40.591
for the public's safety,
as well as that of the driver.

13:42.126 --> 13:45.830
After careful review
of the evidence and testimony,

13:45.930 --> 13:49.666
I am compelled to rule
in favor of the state.

13:49.766 --> 13:52.602
Mr. Martin,
under California Vehicle Code

13:52.669 --> 13:57.506
at sections 13100-13376,

13:57.606 --> 14:01.510
I am hereby revoking
your driver's license

14:01.577 --> 14:03.678
and ordering that your car
be impounded

14:03.778 --> 14:06.415
until you can clearly prove
to this court

14:06.482 --> 14:11.151
that you're fit to drive and
able to obey our traffic laws.

14:11.185 --> 14:12.686
You will have an opportunity

14:12.753 --> 14:15.423
to retest in the next 30 days.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.093
Where do you think
they're taking her?

14:22.429 --> 14:24.096
The impound out on Bancroft.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.366
Looks more like a junkyard
if you ask me.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.667
Oh, that's a shame.

14:29.701 --> 14:32.704
Name's Kendall.
Rock Kendall.

14:32.771 --> 14:36.040
I specialize in helping guys
like you get their car back.

14:36.140 --> 14:37.375
Here.

14:37.442 --> 14:38.876
Call me.

14:40.445 --> 14:42.447
Come on, Timmy.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.047
What the...?

14:48.051 --> 14:49.652
Why'd you do that?

14:49.719 --> 14:53.055
Cheap suit.
White sneakers.

14:53.121 --> 14:54.623
Who dress like that?

14:54.689 --> 14:56.225
I wouldn't trust him
as far as I could spit.

14:56.292 --> 14:59.894
No, no, no, I'm going
to take the test next week

14:59.960 --> 15:02.063
and pass it
with flying colors.

15:06.667 --> 15:07.834
Should we grab it?

15:07.901 --> 15:09.669
You're kidding me,
right?

15:10.804 --> 15:11.871
No.

15:11.905 --> 15:13.573
Victor Martin does not
take the bus.

15:13.673 --> 15:16.041
Not now, not ever.

15:16.075 --> 15:20.813
Losers take the bus.
Losers and old people.

15:38.728 --> 15:40.096
Okay, right here.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.366
Thirty-two, plus tip.

15:43.433 --> 15:46.436
Plus tip?

15:51.106 --> 15:52.774
Ah.

16:01.282 --> 16:02.450
Whoa, what a day.

16:02.517 --> 16:04.251
Mm, tell me
about it.

16:04.284 --> 16:06.119
You work too hard.

16:06.220 --> 16:09.289
No, really, I think I need
to hire an extra person.

16:09.356 --> 16:10.591
Here.

16:10.623 --> 16:11.857
- That's for...
- No.

16:11.923 --> 16:13.392
No, no, no, no.
I insist.

16:13.459 --> 16:15.127
I insist.
Take it, take it.

16:15.194 --> 16:16.562
It's yours.

16:16.628 --> 16:18.564
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.199
Don't you dare.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.237
Aw, you're too sweet.

16:26.770 --> 16:28.138
We're heading back.

16:28.205 --> 16:30.807
Oh, well, I'm staying.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.742
I'll catch a cab back.

16:32.809 --> 16:35.245
Don't stay out too late.
You got your big test tomorrow.

16:35.311 --> 16:39.948
Oh, come on, I... I can drive
around those cones in my sleep.

16:39.982 --> 16:42.252
- Good night, miss.
- Good night.

16:42.318 --> 16:43.918
Yeah.

16:47.489 --> 16:48.624
- What?
- Take this.

16:48.656 --> 16:50.292
No, I don't... I...

16:50.325 --> 16:52.759
Take it. Take it.

16:52.826 --> 16:54.495
I totally, totally...

16:54.562 --> 16:55.662
Wow.

16:57.998 --> 17:00.634
- If you don't mind me asking...
- I don't mind.

17:02.169 --> 17:05.838
What's a man like you still
doing chasing younger women?

17:08.139 --> 17:09.941
You mean a man my age?

17:11.410 --> 17:12.844
Yes.

17:14.078 --> 17:18.483
Because they're so beautiful.

17:21.018 --> 17:22.453
Fair enough.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.855
Hey, I hope I don't come off
like a chauvinist pig.

17:27.658 --> 17:30.527
Pigs are very smart.

17:34.197 --> 17:36.932
Do you want to come
to a pool party with me?

17:41.536 --> 17:43.305
This is amazing.

17:50.177 --> 17:51.945
Hey, come on.

17:52.011 --> 17:55.615
Victor!
Victor, come on!

18:04.556 --> 18:05.723
- Wanna get some?
- Yeah.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.559
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?

18:08.893 --> 18:10.994
- Oh, my... No.
- It'll be fun. Come on.

18:11.061 --> 18:12.663
I'm not going
to take off my pants.

18:12.729 --> 18:14.532
- Whoo!
- Hey!

18:18.202 --> 18:20.135
Whoo! Come on in!

18:24.006 --> 18:25.575
Whoo!

18:36.417 --> 18:37.751
Whoa.

18:38.752 --> 18:41.088
Car handles
like a goddamn tank.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.257
Well, you drive it
like a tank.

18:45.659 --> 18:47.227
Ah!

18:49.596 --> 18:51.163
Think I killed them?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.233
Not sure about the kid.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.501
But the mother?

18:55.568 --> 18:57.035
Definitely.

19:05.377 --> 19:06.745
Sorry.

19:12.048 --> 19:15.418
God, the sun's in my eyes.
I can hardly see.

19:15.451 --> 19:16.852
Just pull over.

19:19.622 --> 19:21.291
Carlos Diaz?

19:22.458 --> 19:24.693
Congratulations,
Mr. Diaz,

19:24.760 --> 19:27.061
the only one who had
a perfect score today.

19:27.128 --> 19:30.632
Take this to Window 12
and schedule your driving test.

19:34.635 --> 19:36.470
Mr. Martin?

19:36.537 --> 19:38.937
Victor Martin?

19:38.971 --> 19:40.440
Huh?

19:40.473 --> 19:41.641
Mr. Martin?

19:41.708 --> 19:43.410
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:00.558 --> 20:02.160
Hey there,
Mr. Martin.

20:04.428 --> 20:05.662
What's up, dude?

20:05.762 --> 20:07.331
Where's the car?

20:15.471 --> 20:17.139
Open the door!

20:17.173 --> 20:19.341
Open the... Oh, shit.

21:13.988 --> 21:16.391
Sir? Are you okay?

21:21.496 --> 21:23.397
Just getting a beer.

21:29.870 --> 21:31.570
Hey, isn't that my...?

21:31.670 --> 21:33.506
What? What the...?

21:34.840 --> 21:37.041
What the hell?

21:41.880 --> 21:44.081
Hey, wait. Hey! Hey!

21:46.817 --> 21:48.385
- Oh!
- Oh!

21:48.419 --> 21:50.220
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Are you all right?

21:50.254 --> 21:52.256
It feels like I'm riding
a bucking bronco here.

21:52.356 --> 21:53.690
Yes. Oh, God.

21:53.757 --> 21:55.691
- So sorry.
- No, it's all right.

21:55.758 --> 21:57.493
Oh, your bag tore.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.731
Oh, dearie. You know what?
I have... I have an extra bag.

22:01.764 --> 22:03.097
Put them in here.

22:03.165 --> 22:05.333
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

22:10.172 --> 22:14.909
"Potassium sorbate,
azo-carbonate..."

22:17.278 --> 22:20.914
"...natural, artificial flavors,
calcium phos..."

22:20.946 --> 22:22.582
I am starting to salivate.

22:22.615 --> 22:24.751
This is to die for.

22:24.784 --> 22:27.952
Making fun
of my honey buns.

22:46.436 --> 22:47.804
No.

22:48.772 --> 22:50.140
Oh, my God.

22:51.307 --> 22:52.441
Ugh.

23:02.283 --> 23:03.551
Oh, boy.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.958
I'll be a son of a bitch.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.829
<i>I am hereby revoking
your driver's license.</i>

23:16.929 --> 23:19.632
<i>evoking your driver's license. R</i>

23:45.522 --> 23:47.489
Oh.

23:56.330 --> 23:57.865
Here it is.

23:57.965 --> 23:59.700
Kendal and Associates.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.034
How'd you find it?

24:01.102 --> 24:03.370
- Checked it on Google.
- Google?

24:04.771 --> 24:07.039
The DMV's top examiner's name

24:07.107 --> 24:10.843
is Larry "Lockdown" Mipps.

24:10.876 --> 24:12.545
Yeah, I know him.

24:12.611 --> 24:16.949
Well, let's have a little look
at his handiwork, shall we?

24:17.016 --> 24:20.118
Now, this is the test course
before Mipps.

24:20.184 --> 24:22.854
Look at how much space there is
between those cones.

24:22.887 --> 24:26.524
This is the test course
after Mipps.

24:26.557 --> 24:28.525
See how much closer
those cones are?

24:28.559 --> 24:29.993
Wow.

24:30.059 --> 24:31.795
Who could do that?

24:31.862 --> 24:35.031
That is where I come in.

24:35.063 --> 24:38.301
For just $799,

24:38.367 --> 24:43.638
I will personally train you
to beat that course.

24:43.705 --> 24:45.040
But...

24:46.241 --> 24:48.009
I want you to listen to me,

24:48.109 --> 24:49.411
and I want you
listen to me good,

24:49.511 --> 24:51.478
because I'm only going
to say this once.

24:51.545 --> 24:52.913
This is not about you

24:53.013 --> 24:56.650
getting back your license
to drive, damn it.

24:56.717 --> 24:58.918
This is about you...

24:58.985 --> 25:02.388
getting back your license
to live.

25:03.890 --> 25:05.692
Wow.

25:05.758 --> 25:09.595
And would you happen to know
who Mr. Mipps' best friend is?

25:09.661 --> 25:11.096
It's none other...

25:12.764 --> 25:14.099
than Tess Woodson.

25:14.199 --> 25:15.766
Your favorite DA.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.234
Oh.

25:17.268 --> 25:18.436
Get her.

25:21.105 --> 25:23.206
Oh! Focus, Victor, focus.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.508
And, by the way,
on one leg.

25:25.575 --> 25:26.910
One leg?

25:26.943 --> 25:28.345
Okay.

25:30.347 --> 25:33.682
Oh. Timmy, would you mind
demonstrating the proper way

25:33.749 --> 25:35.351
to throw a dart?

25:35.417 --> 25:36.719
One leg.

25:41.356 --> 25:42.457
Wow.

25:43.691 --> 25:45.026
Yeah.

25:46.227 --> 25:47.527
What are you doing?

25:47.594 --> 25:50.230
I'm just trying to gauge
your reflexes.

25:53.767 --> 25:55.301
Got it?

25:55.334 --> 25:56.469
Got it.

25:56.535 --> 25:58.638
Look, before I join
your little program,

25:58.738 --> 26:03.308
I need to know how you plan
on finagling my retest.

26:03.408 --> 26:05.276
Not everybody knows this,

26:05.310 --> 26:07.445
but according to the state code,

26:07.479 --> 26:11.982
buried deep in Article 14,
Section 3,

26:12.049 --> 26:14.818
you have a right
to a medical waiver.

26:14.885 --> 26:17.721
And that means
all I have to do

26:17.788 --> 26:20.757
is file a standard DMV form.

26:20.823 --> 26:21.991
And before you can say,

26:22.092 --> 26:23.292
"Where the hell
are my car keys?"

26:23.326 --> 26:24.927
you have a retest date.

26:24.994 --> 26:26.329
Well, what happens

26:26.428 --> 26:27.829
if I don't have
a medical condition?

26:27.929 --> 26:29.164
How old are you?

26:29.264 --> 26:31.500
- 72.
- That's a medical problem.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.802
Oh.

26:33.835 --> 26:36.237
All right, so, what are we
waiting around for?

26:36.303 --> 26:37.938
File the damn papers.

26:38.005 --> 26:40.675
Timmy, if you could, could you
file the form posthaste?

26:42.343 --> 26:45.146
Now, I got to warn you,
Major,

26:45.178 --> 26:47.514
the next few weeks are going
to be your toughest

26:47.580 --> 26:48.648
since boot camp.

26:48.682 --> 26:50.117
You think you can
prepare for that?

26:50.183 --> 26:51.517
- I can handle it.
- Yeah?

26:51.617 --> 26:53.519
- How bad you want that car back?
- I can handle it.

26:53.585 --> 26:55.320
I can handle it.
I want it...

26:55.354 --> 26:56.989
I want the goddamn
car back!

26:57.022 --> 26:58.323
Oh, see?

26:58.357 --> 27:00.092
That's what I'm talking about.

27:00.159 --> 27:02.161
That's the fire I need.

27:03.428 --> 27:04.529
Dude...

27:50.235 --> 27:52.003
Well.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.005
Of all the cafés in
all the towns in all the world.

27:55.073 --> 27:56.574
I had to walk into yours.

27:57.975 --> 27:59.577
- Your place?
- Yes, sir.

27:59.677 --> 28:00.845
Oh!

28:00.911 --> 28:03.346
I must have driven past here
a thousand times.

28:03.413 --> 28:05.248
Well, it's never too late.

28:05.348 --> 28:06.850
Let's make this official.

28:06.916 --> 28:08.152
Caroline Summers.

28:08.219 --> 28:10.087
- Victor Martin.
- Nice to meet you.

28:11.253 --> 28:12.588
Impressive place.

28:15.424 --> 28:18.260
And what about the cuckoo?

28:18.326 --> 28:21.062
Oh, he's extinct.
He never comes out.

28:21.096 --> 28:22.497
Can I get you a table
by the window?

28:22.563 --> 28:24.332
Oh, I've always been
a counter man myself.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.267
Alrighty, then.
Well, belly up to the bar, then.

28:27.334 --> 28:28.869
What do you
recommend?

28:30.204 --> 28:32.839
Our strudel was just named
Pastry of the Year

28:32.906 --> 28:34.573
by <i>Palm Springs Magazine.</i>

28:34.607 --> 28:38.178
We beat out a red velvet cupcake
with pomegranate frosting.

28:38.245 --> 28:40.379
Well, that is stiff
competition.

28:40.446 --> 28:41.614
Mm-hm.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.215
Strudel it is.

28:44.949 --> 28:46.618
Sonia, this is Victor.

28:46.684 --> 28:48.187
- Hi.
- Victor, this is Sonia.

28:48.254 --> 28:49.754
- What do you say, Sonia?
- Nice to meet you.

28:49.788 --> 28:52.723
Now, Victor, I know that you
love your honey buns,

28:52.790 --> 28:55.859
but I think you're going to like
this just a wee bit better.

28:55.926 --> 28:58.129
Okay.

28:58.961 --> 29:00.264
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

29:00.296 --> 29:02.199
All right,
this is the big test now.

29:07.769 --> 29:09.238
Oh, my God.

29:09.304 --> 29:11.306
- Well? Did I lie?
- Oh!

29:11.406 --> 29:12.974
No!

29:13.041 --> 29:14.243
Wow.

29:14.308 --> 29:16.477
Wow, look at this.

29:18.479 --> 29:23.783
"Art auction. Proceeds to help
save the desert turtle."

29:23.817 --> 29:26.920
- Tortoise.
- Tortoise. Excuse me.

29:26.986 --> 29:28.321
Tortoise.

29:29.223 --> 29:32.225
And what about the cuckoo?

29:33.458 --> 29:36.262
I'd have an art auction
for him.

29:36.328 --> 29:38.164
Poor little guy.
Look at him.

29:39.131 --> 29:40.765
Is there a story there?

29:41.833 --> 29:43.068
Uh...

29:43.135 --> 29:44.468
yeah, there is.

29:45.336 --> 29:46.837
Maybe next time.

29:46.903 --> 29:48.939
Right now I'm trying
to figure out this app.

29:49.005 --> 29:50.674
Can't help you there.

29:50.774 --> 29:52.843
I'm still working
on Snapshot.

29:54.944 --> 29:56.246
What are you laughing at?

29:56.313 --> 29:58.848
It's not Snapshot.

29:58.948 --> 30:00.482
It's Snapchat.

30:00.516 --> 30:03.952
Oh. See? I can't even
help you with the name.

30:05.353 --> 30:06.988
My God.

30:07.021 --> 30:08.957
This is the best
I ever had.

30:09.023 --> 30:10.824
- Good, I'm glad you like it.
- Yeah.

30:10.858 --> 30:12.025
It's 100% organic.

30:12.093 --> 30:13.527
Oh!

30:13.594 --> 30:15.829
Well, I think I'm having
an reaction.

30:15.863 --> 30:17.998
I'm having
an allergic reaction.

30:18.031 --> 30:20.867
- Should I call 911?
- I'm having titanium chloride withdrawal.

30:20.933 --> 30:23.103
- Mm-hm.
- Get me something from the package.

30:23.170 --> 30:25.371
It'll be...

30:26.972 --> 30:28.840
I'm better now.

30:33.545 --> 30:35.180
- Yeah. Okay.
- Hey.

30:35.213 --> 30:38.350
Trust me, this is better than
any driving simulator out there.

30:38.382 --> 30:39.717
- Right. Okay.
- Come on.

30:39.783 --> 30:42.485
- All you.
- All right, let's do this.

30:44.355 --> 30:46.890
Oh, this is ridiculous.

30:46.956 --> 30:48.725
Come on.

30:54.529 --> 30:55.831
Oh!

30:59.967 --> 31:02.637
- Yeah.
- I think we'd better try something else.

31:04.005 --> 31:05.240
Oh!

31:05.340 --> 31:06.740
One more time,

31:06.806 --> 31:08.575
how does this prepare me
to get my license back?

31:08.642 --> 31:10.510
Builds toughness.
Competitive drive.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.246
- Yeah?
- Agility.

31:12.313 --> 31:15.348
Plus the fact that I just loved
playing it when I was a kid.

31:16.216 --> 31:17.983
Oh! Oh!

31:24.422 --> 31:25.757
Come on, Sal. Come on...

31:25.823 --> 31:27.259
Oh! Put it up.

31:27.326 --> 31:29.494
Put it up!
Put it up! Oh!

31:31.528 --> 31:33.931
- Whoa!
- Yay!

31:33.997 --> 31:35.933
Victor, take it out.

31:37.034 --> 31:38.434
Come on, find the pairs.

31:38.501 --> 31:40.270
Got this.
Over here is...

31:40.337 --> 31:43.273
Come on, Victor.
Concentrate.

31:43.340 --> 31:44.941
Well, it's...

31:46.008 --> 31:47.109
Oh!

31:47.209 --> 31:48.377
Come on, Victor.
Concentrate.

31:48.443 --> 31:50.612
I'm trying, I'm trying.

31:52.447 --> 31:53.949
Okay, so...

31:55.616 --> 31:58.619
Ace of hearts is...

32:01.222 --> 32:02.755
is...

32:04.224 --> 32:05.558
no.

32:05.625 --> 32:06.793
Victor.

32:06.859 --> 32:07.794
I can't.

32:07.894 --> 32:09.229
That's the whole point,
Victor.

32:09.296 --> 32:10.595
If you get distracted

32:10.629 --> 32:12.198
by some pretty young thing
during the test,

32:12.265 --> 32:14.233
it is bye-bye,
little silver Porsche.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.802
- You're all cracked out!
- I can't do it, man!

32:16.868 --> 32:18.569
- I can't!
- Okay, all right. Okay.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.638
I can't do that in my face
every three seconds.

32:20.705 --> 32:22.207
- All right, let's...
- Hi, how are you?

32:22.274 --> 32:23.442
...let's call it a day,
shall we?

32:23.474 --> 32:24.809
- Oh, geez.
- Nice work, girls.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.310
Yes. Yeah.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.412
And-And five gallons
of cider, please.

32:28.478 --> 32:31.148
No, wait, wait.
Make that six. Yeah.

32:31.215 --> 32:33.117
Whoa, hold on. What...

32:33.150 --> 32:34.783
What are you doing?

32:34.817 --> 32:37.820
I'm trying to figure out
what the heck is wrong with it.

32:37.886 --> 32:39.322
What's he doing?

32:39.422 --> 32:41.124
Trying to fix
the cuckoo.

32:41.157 --> 32:42.391
Really?

32:42.458 --> 32:43.925
Do not go there.

32:43.992 --> 32:45.593
No, Victor, really,
don't bother.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.329
It just... It hasn't worked
in forever.

32:47.429 --> 32:48.930
It's just...

32:48.997 --> 32:50.231
I'm sorry, yes.

32:50.298 --> 32:51.798
Yes, that's everything.

32:51.832 --> 32:53.334
Thanks so much. Bye.

32:57.171 --> 33:01.640
So, you really want to hear
the story of the cuckoo clock?

33:01.674 --> 33:04.910
Yeah, I really want to hear
the story of the cuckoo clock.

33:04.977 --> 33:09.348
Unless you're tired of telling
the story of the cuckoo clock.

33:09.415 --> 33:10.682
No, no, no, no, no.

33:10.749 --> 33:12.751
I mean, do you have
to be anywhere?

33:12.817 --> 33:15.019
My evening's wide open.

33:16.087 --> 33:17.855
Okay, because...

33:17.955 --> 33:21.759
the telling of the story
of the cuckoo clock

33:21.825 --> 33:27.031
needs a certain just-right
accompaniment.

33:29.033 --> 33:30.366
Some wine...

33:33.269 --> 33:35.204
A little wine.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.873
And a little time.

33:37.973 --> 33:39.540
Well, you got me
all intrigued.

33:40.975 --> 33:42.310
Ah.

33:42.377 --> 33:44.179
What?

33:44.212 --> 33:45.613
I thought all wine
was organic.

33:45.679 --> 33:47.281
Oh, please tell me

33:47.348 --> 33:49.682
that you've been living
in a cave all these years.

33:49.716 --> 33:51.385
Well, a nicely
furnished one.

33:52.719 --> 33:54.054
Well, here's to healthy wine.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.322
Here's to healthy wine.

33:56.389 --> 33:58.525
The story of the cuckoo clock...

34:00.626 --> 34:02.727
is really the story
of a spell.

34:02.827 --> 34:04.729
A spell!

34:05.863 --> 34:08.866
If you interrupt me,
bad things happen.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.234
Sorry.

34:10.334 --> 34:13.003
He doesn't move,
but he always is watching.

34:13.071 --> 34:14.871
Huh.

34:14.905 --> 34:19.209
The cuckoo clock
was made in Sebastopol in 1898

34:19.242 --> 34:21.311
by Omar Hussein al-Aman.

34:21.378 --> 34:22.745
He was an old jeweler.

34:22.845 --> 34:25.748
Legend has it
he was 123.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.682
123...?

34:29.418 --> 34:33.922
Now, the clock is his
masterpiece.

34:33.987 --> 34:37.591
It's taken him 11 years
to create it.

34:37.691 --> 34:39.494
It's finally complete.

34:39.561 --> 34:41.895
He brings it home

34:41.928 --> 34:44.565
and he hangs it
on the wall

34:44.597 --> 34:47.767
next to a portrait
of his wife, Helene.

34:47.834 --> 34:51.870
She was his one
and only true love.

34:51.937 --> 34:53.605
And he says,

34:53.672 --> 34:57.443
"I made this in memory
of our love, my darling."

34:58.376 --> 34:59.544
And then he goes to bed

34:59.610 --> 35:02.114
and he closes his eyes.

35:03.381 --> 35:05.350
And at the stroke
of midnight,

35:05.417 --> 35:07.617
he never opens them again.

35:11.188 --> 35:15.592
And it's said that his spirit
inhabits the clock.

35:16.692 --> 35:18.794
So that, my good man,

35:18.861 --> 35:21.464
is the story
of my cuckoo clock.

35:30.438 --> 35:32.806
And the spell?

35:32.873 --> 35:34.808
Well, you know what?
I don't...

35:34.875 --> 35:36.310
I'm not sure, exactly.

35:36.377 --> 35:38.278
You know,
it is kind of the...

35:38.311 --> 35:40.913
You know, if the cuckoo
ever cuckoos again

35:40.980 --> 35:43.316
and someone is...

35:43.416 --> 35:46.285
You know, and I don't know.
Nobody really knows for sure.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.653
Good or bad?

35:50.589 --> 35:51.923
It's...

35:53.159 --> 35:54.626
You know.

36:05.435 --> 36:07.237
You want the sports section,
Vic?

36:08.472 --> 36:10.006
No, I'm okay.

36:14.010 --> 36:16.112
Hey. Hey!

36:16.179 --> 36:17.812
That's my car.

36:17.845 --> 36:19.514
I thought your car
was in the pound.

36:19.614 --> 36:21.249
I thought so too.

36:21.316 --> 36:23.518
Hey! Hey!

36:23.618 --> 36:25.320
Vic, they don't open.

36:25.353 --> 36:27.288
Hey, that's my car!

36:27.354 --> 36:29.590
Hey, wait a minute.

36:32.293 --> 36:33.760
Open the doors!

36:34.860 --> 36:36.795
Hey! Hey!

36:36.862 --> 36:40.333
Hey, that's my car!

36:40.366 --> 36:42.201
Hey! Ah!

36:42.301 --> 36:44.336
Oh, shit!

36:48.106 --> 36:49.707
Goddamn...

36:51.342 --> 36:53.644
Hey. Hey.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.613
Yo, gringo, you okay?

37:02.118 --> 37:03.386
Just a second.

37:03.486 --> 37:04.720
Hey.

37:08.557 --> 37:11.527
Here's what
I need you to do.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.195
Oh! Go!

37:20.801 --> 37:22.569
By the way,

37:22.669 --> 37:24.071
<i>mi nombre es</i> Torres.

37:25.672 --> 37:27.907
<i>Mi es nombre</i>
Victor Martin.

37:36.881 --> 37:38.183
I can't go in.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.917
Why not?

37:39.984 --> 37:42.153
I don't intend to go back
in <i>la pinta.</i>

37:43.321 --> 37:44.989
<i>Pinta,</i> man. Jail.

37:45.056 --> 37:47.258
One more strike
and I'm off for a while.

38:19.619 --> 38:20.953
Hot.

38:22.122 --> 38:24.857
Hey! You got a permit
to be in here?

38:26.191 --> 38:29.094
I saw someone driving my car
just a while ago.

38:29.128 --> 38:30.962
No one took your car,
old man.

38:31.030 --> 38:33.964
Now get out before I have you
arrested for trespassing.

38:35.199 --> 38:36.367
Get out of here.

38:37.801 --> 38:39.370
I'll be back for you.

38:48.078 --> 38:50.746
- Motherfucker.
- Crazy old man.

38:50.812 --> 38:52.715
- So?
- Found her.

38:52.782 --> 38:53.915
She was waiting for me.

38:53.982 --> 38:55.651
I got to get her back.

38:55.718 --> 38:57.286
Listen, Vic,

38:57.320 --> 38:59.254
you give me a call anytime
you need a ride, all right?

38:59.321 --> 39:01.656
I feel bad about all this.
Your car wouldn't be in here...

39:01.723 --> 39:04.426
No, no, no, no, no.

39:04.492 --> 39:05.958
Not your fault.

39:05.993 --> 39:08.662
You're not the only dipshit
at this party.

39:20.972 --> 39:22.641
<i>...an art auction tonight</i>

39:22.674 --> 39:24.343
<i>at the Cuckoo Café.</i>

39:24.409 --> 39:26.178
<i>All proceeds will go to save
the desert tortoises.</i>

39:26.278 --> 39:28.814
<i>Make sure you
and all your friends show up.</i>

39:30.681 --> 39:32.849
We've come to fix the clock.

39:34.318 --> 39:37.021
Ha! My name is
Victor Von Martin.

39:37.121 --> 39:39.989
former jet pilot,
insane mechanical skills.

39:40.023 --> 39:42.525
This is Salvatore Spinelli.

39:42.592 --> 39:45.328
Salvatore, jeweler,
42 years.

39:45.362 --> 39:47.329
Forty-three, actually.

39:47.363 --> 39:48.863
Nice to meet you.

39:48.963 --> 39:52.267
Victor, I really appreciate
your enthusiasm, but no.

39:52.334 --> 39:54.435
The cuckoo will cuckoo
no more.

39:54.502 --> 39:57.105
Fraulein, you insult me.

39:59.107 --> 40:03.043
He told me about the spell.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.380
I need to know.

40:10.949 --> 40:13.386
- What's that?
- 123-year-old guy

40:13.486 --> 40:14.787
who fondled himself.

40:18.390 --> 40:21.459
- That's a good tone.
- Good tone.

40:21.526 --> 40:23.461
Gain weight, lose weight.

40:26.463 --> 40:29.400
- Yeah.
- Hey, I see...

40:30.900 --> 40:32.836
I saw. I saw.

40:32.902 --> 40:34.237
This is so much better.

40:34.303 --> 40:36.139
This is what
Sherlock Holmes used.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.145
- There we go.
- Look at that.

40:43.211 --> 40:45.380
It's coming together, man.

40:52.186 --> 40:53.320
Cogs.

40:53.387 --> 40:54.522
Lots of cogs?

40:54.588 --> 40:55.922
Lots of cogs.

40:57.191 --> 40:58.858
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.393
- A counter cog.
- Yeah.

41:02.595 --> 41:04.431
- Wow.
- Hey.

41:04.497 --> 41:06.265
- Wow.
- What do you see?

41:15.740 --> 41:18.176
Eight, seven,

41:18.242 --> 41:20.611
six, five,

41:20.678 --> 41:23.613
four, three,

41:23.713 --> 41:26.349
two, one!

41:26.416 --> 41:28.285
Come on, baby!

41:32.721 --> 41:35.357
- Come on.
- Come on!

41:37.792 --> 41:40.361
Oh, shoot.

41:40.428 --> 41:42.597
I'm so sorry, man.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.032
Well, we just...

41:47.968 --> 41:49.536
You did it! You did it!

41:49.603 --> 41:51.472
You did it!

41:51.572 --> 41:53.140
- I can't believe you did it!
- Yes!

41:53.240 --> 41:54.474
I can't believe
you did it!

41:54.540 --> 41:56.409
I can't believe it either.

41:58.711 --> 42:00.146
I can't believe it either.

42:00.246 --> 42:02.147
Are you all right?

42:02.247 --> 42:03.482
Yes. Yes.

42:04.716 --> 42:06.318
And the spell...

42:09.054 --> 42:11.121
What a beautiful thing.

42:14.658 --> 42:16.160
Him?

42:17.294 --> 42:18.661
I guess.

42:20.230 --> 42:23.099
I can't believe
grandma was right.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.001
I'll meet the one and only....

42:25.068 --> 42:27.002
When the cuckoo strikes again.

42:27.069 --> 42:29.304
Don't say it! Don't say it!

42:32.241 --> 42:33.342
Oh, wow.

42:35.476 --> 42:37.745
Hey, Sal.

42:37.812 --> 42:40.281
- Yeah?
- Can I ask you a question?

42:40.348 --> 42:41.748
Sure.

42:41.815 --> 42:43.783
How long were you married
with Jenny?

42:43.850 --> 42:47.254
Forty-two years.

42:49.189 --> 42:51.757
And, Sal, how is it?

42:51.824 --> 42:55.661
I mean, you know, I'd see you
squabbling every now and then.

42:55.694 --> 42:58.630
Ah. Ups and downs.

42:59.864 --> 43:02.700
But I'd do it all over again.

43:02.767 --> 43:03.935
- You would?
- Yeah.

43:04.003 --> 43:05.370
Give me that.

43:06.303 --> 43:08.205
You ready to settle down?

43:08.272 --> 43:09.373
Yeah.

43:11.308 --> 43:12.442
Wow.

43:17.647 --> 43:20.650
How would you like to go
to an auction tonight?

43:24.886 --> 43:28.123
Well, well, well.
Look at the two of you.

43:28.189 --> 43:30.025
A couple of Hollywood
leading men.

43:30.057 --> 43:31.225
You look ravishing.

43:31.292 --> 43:33.561
Yeah. Gorgeous dress.

43:33.627 --> 43:36.031
Oh, thanks, guys.

43:37.131 --> 43:39.065
This picture,
where'd you take it?

43:39.165 --> 43:40.733
Gosh, that was
my very first assignment

43:40.833 --> 43:42.402
for <i>National Geographic.</i>

43:42.468 --> 43:44.837
They sent me out in the desert
to photograph the wildlife.

43:44.904 --> 43:46.405
And just as I arrived,

43:46.505 --> 43:49.541
this little fella showed up
and smiled at me.

43:50.842 --> 43:52.377
Oh, wow.

43:53.578 --> 43:55.413
Anyway, let's get
this auction started.

43:57.049 --> 43:58.416
Victor...

43:59.985 --> 44:01.651
save the tortoise.

44:01.718 --> 44:05.155
Save the desert.
Save the world.

44:09.993 --> 44:12.428
Save the tortoise, Victor.

44:16.165 --> 44:18.033
I might just do that.

44:19.500 --> 44:21.703
And the current bid is $350.

44:21.769 --> 44:24.572
350 going once.
350 going twice.

44:24.606 --> 44:26.273
$350...

44:26.373 --> 44:28.909
sold to that beautiful woman
in the front row.

44:31.445 --> 44:35.615
Our next item is our very own
hostess's award-winning photo

44:35.715 --> 44:37.617
of a happy desert tortoise.

44:38.952 --> 44:40.353
So let's start the bidding
at $500.

44:40.419 --> 44:42.754
Anybody for $500?
Five hundred. Five hundred.

44:42.787 --> 44:45.190
There's a bid for 500,
boom, right there.

44:45.256 --> 44:47.626
Anybody for 600?
How about $600?

44:47.692 --> 44:49.360
- Six hundred!
- Six hundred there.

44:49.426 --> 44:51.161
Why are we stopping?
Now let's go to 700.

44:51.228 --> 44:52.529
$700 is the...

44:52.596 --> 44:54.231
Seven hundred
is the bid right there.

44:54.298 --> 44:56.233
$700 for Caroline's
beautiful photo

44:56.300 --> 45:00.070
of a happy desert tortoise
that needs our help.

45:00.136 --> 45:01.471
One thousand.

45:01.537 --> 45:03.573
One thousand it is right there.

45:03.640 --> 45:05.574
The bid is at one grand.
One grand, everybody.

45:05.641 --> 45:07.110

45:10.312 --> 45:12.280

- Three thousand dollars,

45:12.314 --> 45:14.448
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Five thousand!

45:14.749 --> 45:16.450
Five thousand.

45:16.484 --> 45:19.320
Five thousand dollars
is the current bid.

45:19.420 --> 45:23.423
Victor, you got that kinda dough
to spend on a turtle?

45:23.490 --> 45:24.324
Tortoise!

45:24.357 --> 45:25.759
Five thousand going twice.

45:25.825 --> 45:27.128
Five thousand...

45:27.160 --> 45:29.229
Ten thousand dollars!

45:29.294 --> 45:32.132
Ten thousand dollars is the bid.

45:32.164 --> 45:35.001
Ten thousand dollars. Oh, my.

45:35.101 --> 45:36.635
In the room,
ten thousand going once.

45:36.669 --> 45:38.269
Ten thousand going twice.

45:38.336 --> 45:39.804
Ten thousand going three times.

45:39.837 --> 45:42.774
And sold to Señor Diego Lozano!

45:55.751 --> 45:57.154
Are you comin'?

45:57.219 --> 45:59.922
Ah, I think
I'll stick around a while.

45:59.990 --> 46:03.792
She's a good woman, lucky you.

46:03.858 --> 46:05.027
Talk to you tomorrow.

46:05.127 --> 46:06.695
Hey, goodnight, Sal.
Thanks for coming.

46:06.761 --> 46:07.762
Yep.

46:07.829 --> 46:09.363
Whoo, what a night.

46:09.430 --> 46:11.032
We raised a lot of money.

46:11.132 --> 46:12.033
We did.

46:12.100 --> 46:13.034
Where does this...

46:13.101 --> 46:14.368
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:14.435 --> 46:16.704
Put that down.
I have a much better idea.

46:16.804 --> 46:18.204
Follow me.

46:22.943 --> 46:26.778
Oh, no. No, thank you.

46:26.845 --> 46:29.182
You smoke often?

46:29.214 --> 46:30.882
Often enough.

46:30.950 --> 46:33.451
Does wonders for my arthritis.

46:34.852 --> 46:35.886
Where do you buy it?

46:35.987 --> 46:38.222
I don't. I grow it.

46:38.322 --> 46:41.791
Why do you think
my strudels is so popular?

46:44.195 --> 46:45.996
Hey, I better try
some of that.

46:48.732 --> 46:50.699
Secret to the strudel.

46:54.903 --> 46:57.305
- Wow. Not bad.
- Ahh...

46:57.371 --> 46:59.007
You know, it's funny.

46:59.074 --> 47:03.644
If it wasn't for the bus,
we never would've met

47:03.711 --> 47:06.913
and my clock would still be
without its cuckoo.

47:07.014 --> 47:09.217
Yeah, I mean,
talk about cuckoo.

47:09.249 --> 47:11.718
Oh, come on.

47:11.752 --> 47:14.087
You're a pilot.
You're used to getting high.

47:14.187 --> 47:16.156
Yeah, but this grass
is Mach 12.

47:16.223 --> 47:21.693
I haven't heard it called grass
since the '70s.

47:21.760 --> 47:25.597
You don't look like
a bus guy to me.

47:25.663 --> 47:28.100
Oh.

47:28.167 --> 47:32.269
My dear,
let me show you something.

47:33.337 --> 47:35.272
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Mm.

47:35.339 --> 47:39.109
Judge took it away from me
and my license.

47:39.209 --> 47:40.576
I miss her.

47:40.610 --> 47:42.678
Her?

47:42.745 --> 47:44.948
We've been together
a long time.

47:45.015 --> 47:47.950
Sorta get, uh,
used to things.

47:48.050 --> 47:49.684
I suppose you do.

47:49.751 --> 47:52.188
But wait, wait,
let me see that again.

47:54.889 --> 47:57.959
- Oh, no.
- What? What?

47:58.059 --> 47:59.894
You're the...

48:02.529 --> 48:05.698
You almost killed
half a dozen people down there.

48:05.765 --> 48:06.699
Down where?

48:06.766 --> 48:07.734
Oh, come here.

48:16.308 --> 48:17.642
Does that look familiar?

48:19.744 --> 48:21.412
You're an idiot!

48:26.250 --> 48:29.486
I was an idiot.

48:29.586 --> 48:30.487
Was?

48:30.587 --> 48:32.156
I'm not gonna do that again.

48:32.223 --> 48:33.722
I don't want to lose her again.

48:33.789 --> 48:36.625
- Why is she that important?
- She's my youth.

48:36.659 --> 48:41.629
On the other hand,
if I hadn't lost her,

48:41.663 --> 48:43.598
I wouldn't have found you.

48:45.567 --> 48:48.170
That was good. I like that.

48:48.270 --> 48:50.939
I retest for my license
next week.

48:51.005 --> 48:53.141
Then I'll be able
to take you for a ride.

48:53.174 --> 48:57.011
So, you,
you ever been married?

48:57.077 --> 48:59.846
Me? Oh, no, no.

49:02.015 --> 49:07.352
I think I'm too revolutionary
in my relationships.

49:07.419 --> 49:10.156
As my very Bohemian father
used to say,

49:10.189 --> 49:12.591
marriage is all about
property and ownership.

49:12.657 --> 49:15.359
It's got nothing to do
with love.

49:15.459 --> 49:20.831
And what about love? Where does that
fit in your revolutionary doctrine?

49:20.865 --> 49:23.800
You're a very inquisitive man.

49:23.867 --> 49:26.337
I've been in love, yes.

49:28.305 --> 49:31.975
All great, exciting men.

49:32.041 --> 49:37.545
One lasted a train ride
from Paris to Istanbul.

49:37.612 --> 49:42.617
Another one lasted as long
as my assignment in Cairo.

49:42.683 --> 49:45.619
I did a shoot there
of the Pyramids.

49:47.454 --> 49:49.223
God, that was fun.

49:50.958 --> 49:52.360
Except I got pregnant.

49:52.392 --> 49:54.660
- You have a child?
- Mm-hmm.

49:56.029 --> 49:59.232
So what about you, Top Gun?
You ever been in love?

49:59.299 --> 50:04.069
Oh, once. Third grade.

50:04.136 --> 50:07.006
Laura Swanbrow.

50:08.374 --> 50:11.541
My desk was right behind hers.

50:11.575 --> 50:16.047
I used to lean in
and blow on her ear.

50:19.249 --> 50:20.750
How did that work for you?

50:20.816 --> 50:22.652
She reported me
to the principal.

50:27.156 --> 50:28.991
Why did you do that, Laura?

50:29.058 --> 50:30.592
Why did you...

50:32.560 --> 50:36.897
Wow. I went out there.

50:36.932 --> 50:38.832
I was on a trip.

50:44.939 --> 50:47.740
I... I should probably
call you an Uber.

50:47.774 --> 50:49.108
A what?

50:49.208 --> 50:52.278
It's a taxi.

50:52.345 --> 50:56.015
Oh. Okay.

50:56.082 --> 50:57.615
I'll need your address.

51:04.689 --> 51:05.957
Hi.

51:06.023 --> 51:07.457
Caroline!

51:07.524 --> 51:09.126
Come on, get dressed.
I want to show you something.

51:09.226 --> 51:10.627
I'll wait in the car.

51:16.632 --> 51:18.969
Where are we going?

51:19.069 --> 51:20.803
It's a surprise.

51:20.869 --> 51:22.271
Visit the tortoises?

51:25.307 --> 51:27.809
Come on.

51:27.875 --> 51:28.810
Let's go.

52:05.842 --> 52:07.643
Wow!

52:07.677 --> 52:09.178
- What do you think?
- Oh, my gosh.

52:09.278 --> 52:10.480
Now, I don't know much
about cars,

52:10.512 --> 52:11.747
so which one's the best?

52:11.813 --> 52:13.182
They're all fantastic.

52:13.282 --> 52:14.951
I know, but which one
do you wanna try?

52:15.018 --> 52:18.753
Oh, Caroline!
Why are you doing this for me?

52:18.819 --> 52:21.522
You did something for me.
I do something for you.

52:21.622 --> 52:22.857
That's fair.

52:22.958 --> 52:25.159
I don't have my license.

52:25.192 --> 52:27.527
Oh, no, it's okay.
It's a private track, you don't need it.

52:27.627 --> 52:28.929
Now come on, pick one.

52:30.663 --> 52:35.301
Oh, pretty.

52:35.368 --> 52:36.336
Get in.

52:36.369 --> 52:37.636
Wow.

52:41.273 --> 52:42.207
Wow.

52:42.274 --> 52:46.145
Ah!

52:46.211 --> 52:47.346
Well, what do you think?

52:47.379 --> 52:49.047
How did you arrange all this?

52:49.113 --> 52:50.281
My friend owns the track.

52:50.348 --> 52:52.450
No. Wow.

52:52.517 --> 52:54.352
Well, get in.

52:54.385 --> 52:56.653
Oh, no,
I don't do that sort of thing.

52:56.720 --> 52:59.389
No, if you don't get in,
I'm not driving.

53:00.490 --> 53:03.859
Oh, no, no, no!

53:03.894 --> 53:05.560
There's cones! There's cones!

53:20.707 --> 53:23.077
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I wanna get out.

53:24.912 --> 53:28.048
No!

53:41.093 --> 53:42.360
Oh!

53:57.440 --> 53:59.109
Oh!

53:59.209 --> 54:02.945
- You were great!
- Whoo!

54:03.011 --> 54:05.581
Oh, I don't know if
I can stand on my own feet.

54:05.613 --> 54:07.849
That was beautiful.
Just like the old days.

54:07.916 --> 54:09.117
Only better.

54:09.183 --> 54:12.253
The fastest car I ever drove
was a Beetle.

54:22.295 --> 54:23.696
Thank you.

54:25.064 --> 54:26.532
For the car or the kiss?

54:26.599 --> 54:27.900
Both.

54:29.801 --> 54:31.971
Wanna try another one?

54:32.037 --> 54:33.071
Car or kiss?

54:34.638 --> 54:36.773
- That one!
- Oh, yes, that one!

54:51.921 --> 54:53.890
Would you mind
calling me an Uber?

54:56.658 --> 54:58.560
There's something else
I want you to show you.

54:59.793 --> 55:01.729
And here we are.

55:04.999 --> 55:06.766
Holy Toledo.

55:06.833 --> 55:08.668
I have something for you.

55:14.407 --> 55:16.075
Voilà.

55:16.142 --> 55:20.513
Wow. I thought you said
there was only one.

55:20.580 --> 55:21.779
I had two made.

55:21.846 --> 55:23.781
And I though
you should have one.

55:28.287 --> 55:30.754
You know, I was thinking...

55:30.820 --> 55:33.958
I like fast cars,
you like tortoises.

55:35.493 --> 55:38.694
Oh, dear. I think you have
the wrong idea about me.

55:38.794 --> 55:41.364
Oh? How's that?

55:41.431 --> 55:43.099
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

55:43.166 --> 55:45.668
I haven't always been
this old lady.

55:45.700 --> 55:47.036
You're not old.

55:49.438 --> 55:51.706
I'm not old. We're young.

55:51.806 --> 55:53.041
Just double the age.

55:53.141 --> 55:54.876
I'm still trying
to figure out

55:54.976 --> 55:56.611
what I'm gonna do
when I grow up.

55:56.678 --> 56:02.149
Well, then... let's not.

56:02.216 --> 56:05.552
In fact, after today,

56:05.619 --> 56:08.222
I like fast cars.

56:08.288 --> 56:09.788
Oh, wow.

56:12.391 --> 56:13.859
Oh, my God.

56:15.494 --> 56:16.562
Jesus.

56:17.862 --> 56:19.130
Wait, let me get my shoes off.

56:19.197 --> 56:21.233
- Okay, okay.
- Let me get my shoes off.

56:23.368 --> 56:25.236
Ooh. Mm.

56:32.741 --> 56:34.310
- You okay?
- Yeah.

56:44.353 --> 56:47.256
Here, sip this.
Sip this.

56:50.591 --> 56:51.559
Oh, yeah, I'm okay.

56:51.592 --> 56:52.426
- Better?
- Yeah.

57:03.403 --> 57:07.172
If my cough lasts more than
four hours, call my doctor.

57:13.044 --> 57:15.779
Mm. Oh.

57:15.880 --> 57:17.849
Good morning.

57:21.051 --> 57:22.352
Mm.

57:23.786 --> 57:25.555
- Oh.
- What?

57:25.622 --> 57:27.024
I have to get up.

57:27.090 --> 57:29.125
- No. No, no, no.
- I have to open the cafe.

57:29.225 --> 57:30.960
- I do. I do. I do.
- No, don't go.

57:31.027 --> 57:35.464
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- Mm.

57:35.531 --> 57:37.866
- Yeah, that was the pill.
- I know.

57:37.932 --> 57:41.936
- Just one more time.
- Oh.

57:41.970 --> 57:43.638
What color pills do you take?

57:43.705 --> 57:45.272
I didn't take any.

57:45.306 --> 57:46.540
Blue.

57:49.977 --> 57:51.879
Mm.

57:54.881 --> 57:56.649
Oh, my God.

58:11.462 --> 58:13.830
Victor...

58:13.931 --> 58:16.566
I want to ask you something.

58:16.633 --> 58:19.436
I took the test,
it was negative.

58:19.502 --> 58:22.639
Not that bad.

58:22.672 --> 58:24.274
It's the tortoises.

58:24.341 --> 58:28.277
I need press.
I need to raise more money.

58:28.344 --> 58:30.846
I need publicity.

58:30.946 --> 58:32.513
You think you can help me?

58:32.613 --> 58:34.482
I'd be honored.

58:34.515 --> 58:36.017
Thank you.

58:42.923 --> 58:44.691
Let's go here.

58:44.791 --> 58:50.196
Ah. Um...

58:50.296 --> 58:53.199
Go away. Go away.

58:53.265 --> 58:58.103
Ah...

58:58.169 --> 59:01.706
Hmm...

59:01.806 --> 59:03.942
Let's see...

59:04.008 --> 59:06.377
Go away. Go away.

59:06.443 --> 59:09.980
Oh!

59:10.047 --> 59:12.282
All right, all right!

59:12.349 --> 59:14.217
Ah...

59:17.553 --> 59:19.322
Ah...

59:29.730 --> 59:31.465
Right...

59:44.077 --> 59:47.913
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

59:47.980 --> 59:50.082
Don't hurt me.

1:00:48.365 --> 1:00:51.302
Well, well,
if it isn't Victor Martin,

1:00:51.368 --> 1:00:55.139
the man who lies in your bed
while he lies to your face.

1:00:55.206 --> 1:00:57.140
Hi, Amy.

1:00:57.240 --> 1:00:58.241
Angie.

1:00:58.308 --> 1:00:59.342
Uh...

1:00:59.442 --> 1:01:01.044
I thought you left town.

1:01:01.110 --> 1:01:02.479
No, I'm still here.

1:01:02.545 --> 1:01:05.747
Just I got.. tied up
with certain issues.

1:01:05.814 --> 1:01:07.149
You were never gonna call me.

1:01:07.249 --> 1:01:09.218
No. Yes, I was gonna call you.

1:01:09.284 --> 1:01:10.954
- You're an ass.
- But like I...

1:01:19.660 --> 1:01:21.495
I got it! I got it!

1:01:21.595 --> 1:01:25.265
Never fear, Victor is here.

1:01:27.734 --> 1:01:31.637
Winner!

1:01:31.670 --> 1:01:32.671
Hey, Amy.

1:01:32.771 --> 1:01:33.672
Angie.

1:01:33.772 --> 1:01:37.075
Angela.

1:01:37.141 --> 1:01:40.011
I am really sorry
I didn't call you.

1:01:40.078 --> 1:01:41.079
I really...
I really...

1:01:41.145 --> 1:01:42.680
I really meant to call you.

1:01:42.780 --> 1:01:45.984
It's just that I got tied up
with some serious issues.

1:01:46.016 --> 1:01:48.485
Gosh. Victor, are you okay?

1:01:48.519 --> 1:01:51.622
No, no, I'm fine,
I'm fine, considering.

1:01:51.688 --> 1:01:53.122
But thank you for asking.

1:01:53.189 --> 1:01:56.092
And... And... And...
I, uh...

1:01:56.158 --> 1:02:00.029
I promise you,
I will call you

1:02:00.129 --> 1:02:01.931
as soon as things
get back to...

1:02:01.998 --> 1:02:03.632
to normal.

1:02:04.867 --> 1:02:05.800
Thanks.

1:02:05.868 --> 1:02:08.136
Can I ask you a small favor?

1:02:08.203 --> 1:02:10.337
Someone stole your car?

1:02:10.371 --> 1:02:11.372
Yeah.

1:02:11.438 --> 1:02:13.340
Son of a bitch.

1:02:13.374 --> 1:02:15.342
I hope they find out
whoever did it

1:02:15.376 --> 1:02:18.378
and string 'em up
by their toes.

1:02:19.512 --> 1:02:21.648
We had some good times
in that car.

1:02:21.714 --> 1:02:23.017
We sure did.

1:02:23.049 --> 1:02:24.183
You see that red Jeep
up ahead there?

1:02:24.217 --> 1:02:25.684
You know who Diego Lozano is?

1:02:25.717 --> 1:02:28.353
Of course I know.
He's an amazing artist.

1:02:28.387 --> 1:02:29.822
Yeah, amazing.
I think he's in that...

1:02:29.889 --> 1:02:31.390
I think he's in that, uh, Jeep.

1:02:41.966 --> 1:02:43.066
What're you doing?

1:02:43.133 --> 1:02:44.902
I dropped my wallet.

1:02:45.002 --> 1:02:48.237
Forget your wallet.
He's right there.

1:02:50.539 --> 1:02:52.741
Victor!

1:02:52.809 --> 1:02:56.145
What the hell's wrong with you?

1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:01.016
He's with my girlfriend!
That's what the hell's wrong with me.

1:03:11.758 --> 1:03:13.225
This address, quickly.

1:03:13.292 --> 1:03:15.062
Hey, that's not cheap.

1:03:15.094 --> 1:03:16.262
You again?

1:03:16.362 --> 1:03:19.599
I don't care. Do it.
Do it. Do it.

1:03:19.665 --> 1:03:22.434
And don't forget the tip
this time, huh?

1:03:39.115 --> 1:03:40.583
Hey! That's my cart!

1:03:40.617 --> 1:03:43.586
I'll have it back
in 15 minutes, I promise!

1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:46.288
Come back here! Asshole!

1:03:59.034 --> 1:04:00.801
This is perfect.

1:04:00.868 --> 1:04:02.602
No way.

1:04:02.636 --> 1:04:04.471
Wait, my dear.

1:04:04.537 --> 1:04:05.739
Okay, I'll wait.

1:04:05.806 --> 1:04:06.974
Mmm.

1:04:08.707 --> 1:04:09.708
So good.

1:04:09.775 --> 1:04:12.778
Oh, my God!

1:04:12.812 --> 1:04:14.948
Listen to me.

1:04:14.981 --> 1:04:17.816
He's peeping
through the windows.

1:04:17.883 --> 1:04:20.652
Either that or he's pissing
in the petunias.

1:04:25.288 --> 1:04:27.091
I can't talk right now.

1:04:27.157 --> 1:04:28.425
<i>Are you with Caroline?</i>

1:04:28.492 --> 1:04:29.827
I'm not sure.

1:04:29.927 --> 1:04:31.261
<i>Whadya mean, you're not sure?</i>

1:04:31.328 --> 1:04:32.328
<i>Is she there?</i>

1:04:32.428 --> 1:04:33.830
Yes. No. Sort of.

1:04:33.897 --> 1:04:35.631
<i>Victor, what's going on?</i>

1:04:35.665 --> 1:04:37.500
Step away from the bushes.

1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:39.168
Victor, that you?

1:04:39.268 --> 1:04:44.506
I can't talk to you right now.

1:04:44.572 --> 1:04:46.508
Oh, hi, Nance.

1:04:46.574 --> 1:04:48.242
What are you doing
in the bushes?

1:04:48.308 --> 1:04:49.610
Looking for my ball.

1:04:49.677 --> 1:04:51.278
Idyllwild 3.

1:04:51.345 --> 1:04:53.148
That's what you were doing?
Looking for your ball?

1:04:53.213 --> 1:04:58.451
I hooked it badly
and it came in here and...

1:04:58.518 --> 1:04:59.652
There it is.

1:05:02.789 --> 1:05:03.957
Well, I'll be damned.

1:05:04.024 --> 1:05:06.358
Idyllwild 3.

1:05:14.598 --> 1:05:16.168
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise.

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:17.535
Can I come in?

1:05:20.171 --> 1:05:21.337
What's wrong?

1:05:21.371 --> 1:05:25.275
You... hanging out
with Mr. Artiste.

1:05:25.341 --> 1:05:26.944
That's what's wrong.

1:05:27.011 --> 1:05:28.310
Diego?

1:05:28.377 --> 1:05:29.378
Mm.

1:05:29.445 --> 1:05:33.817
And that's wrong how?

1:05:35.350 --> 1:05:37.485
Goddamn it, Caroline.

1:05:37.552 --> 1:05:39.520
You were completely naked
with another man.

1:05:39.554 --> 1:05:41.857
- That what's wrong.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:05:41.890 --> 1:05:44.391
Please don't tell me
you were spying on us.

1:05:44.458 --> 1:05:46.226
Of course
I wasn't spying on you.

1:05:46.326 --> 1:05:48.863
I was playing golf.

1:05:48.896 --> 1:05:50.330
Looking for my ball.

1:05:50.397 --> 1:05:52.665
Little did I realize
that I'd find you instead...

1:05:52.732 --> 1:05:54.968
naked with another man!

1:05:55.035 --> 1:05:56.502
That's what's wrong.

1:05:59.338 --> 1:06:02.574
Um, I really can't
handle this right now.

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:04.342
I need you to leave.

1:06:05.878 --> 1:06:07.579
Please get out of my cafe.

1:06:07.645 --> 1:06:11.916
Okay. Victor Martin will never
set foot in your kooky cafe again.

1:06:12.016 --> 1:06:13.852
Have a nice life.
Thank you very much.

1:06:14.919 --> 1:06:15.920
The same to you.

1:06:15.987 --> 1:06:20.690
But not too nice!

1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:42.709
Mom?

1:06:42.776 --> 1:06:46.746
Oh, hi. Hi, baby.

1:06:46.781 --> 1:06:48.614
Hi, Mom.

1:06:48.714 --> 1:06:51.416
Oh, Mom!

1:06:51.450 --> 1:06:56.088
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- Wow, you're a little drunk.

1:06:56.121 --> 1:06:57.923
I...

1:06:57.956 --> 1:07:02.560
I had one glass.

1:07:02.627 --> 1:07:03.761
After another.

1:07:08.065 --> 1:07:12.135
Mom. Hey.

1:07:15.771 --> 1:07:17.573
Did he dump you?

1:07:20.276 --> 1:07:23.279
No.

1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:27.582
I dumped him.

1:07:27.649 --> 1:07:29.818
I thought...

1:07:32.452 --> 1:07:34.789
Why did he have to see that?

1:07:43.297 --> 1:07:49.168
I-I can't stand jealous fools.

1:07:49.268 --> 1:07:53.637
Jealous of who?

1:07:53.671 --> 1:07:55.941
Diego.

1:07:56.007 --> 1:07:57.309
What?

1:07:57.341 --> 1:07:58.977
Oh, my God.

1:08:05.115 --> 1:08:07.750
Oh, my God.

1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:35.842
Here you go.

1:08:35.876 --> 1:08:37.376
Put that on.

1:08:50.054 --> 1:08:51.890
What about La Pinta?

1:08:51.956 --> 1:08:53.892
I'll take my chances.

1:08:53.958 --> 1:08:55.559
You got it.

1:08:55.659 --> 1:08:58.896
- I'll get this.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

1:08:58.996 --> 1:09:00.163
Watch yourself.

1:09:00.230 --> 1:09:01.798
Sharp stuff here.

1:09:17.012 --> 1:09:18.512
Wait a minute. Wait.

1:09:20.781 --> 1:09:22.249
Wait a minute.

1:09:22.349 --> 1:09:23.750
This is where it was.

1:09:28.187 --> 1:09:30.256
Hey, I see it, over here.

1:09:30.323 --> 1:09:32.025
Let's take a closer look.

1:09:35.661 --> 1:09:37.262
Just bring her back by midnight.

1:09:37.329 --> 1:09:39.331
Otherwise I keep the deposit.

1:09:40.598 --> 1:09:43.368
Now that's a goddamn car.

1:09:43.434 --> 1:09:46.237
You son of a bitch!

1:09:46.270 --> 1:09:47.772
You're renting out my car!

1:09:47.872 --> 1:09:48.773
Oh, shit!

1:09:48.873 --> 1:09:50.440
You can't prove a thing,
old man.

1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:52.943
Well, maybe I can't,
but that camera can.

1:09:53.009 --> 1:09:55.879
That camera hasn't worked
since I started working here.

1:09:55.946 --> 1:09:57.948
You little shit!

1:09:58.048 --> 1:09:59.615
This one works.

1:09:59.715 --> 1:10:03.252
And it's streaming live
to my friends, the policia.

1:10:08.957 --> 1:10:12.794
- Victor!
- Oh, shit!

1:10:12.894 --> 1:10:14.695
All right, all right.

1:10:14.762 --> 1:10:16.629
You're gonna be fine.
Let's get you in the car.

1:10:16.696 --> 1:10:18.298
Let's get you in the car.
Let's get you in the car.

1:10:21.902 --> 1:10:25.304
Okay.

1:10:25.371 --> 1:10:28.074
I... I can't...
I can't breathe.

1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:31.310
I can't breathe.

1:10:45.956 --> 1:10:48.758
<i>Hot pursuit,
convertible Porsche.</i>

1:10:49.658 --> 1:10:52.462
<i>Pull over to the side.</i>

1:10:52.494 --> 1:10:54.831
Oh, not good.

1:10:56.999 --> 1:10:58.499
Pull over!

1:11:00.068 --> 1:11:01.602
Pull over!

1:11:01.669 --> 1:11:03.604
He had a heart attack!
I'm taking him to the hospital!

1:11:03.671 --> 1:11:06.506
Christ. Get behind us!

1:11:08.075 --> 1:11:11.145
<i>ealth emergency. Heart attack. H
eed backup. N</i>

1:11:11.178 --> 1:11:13.013
<i>eading for Mercy Hospital now. H</i>

1:11:29.093 --> 1:11:31.029
- Okay, Victor.
- All right, Victor.

1:11:31.129 --> 1:11:34.432
- Okay. You're gonna be fine.
- We got you. It's all right.

1:11:34.499 --> 1:11:36.133
Everything's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1:11:36.199 --> 1:11:37.633
All right, here we go.

1:11:37.700 --> 1:11:39.202
- There we go. Up.
- All right.

1:11:39.269 --> 1:11:40.037
That's it.

1:11:47.777 --> 1:11:49.879
Caroline?

1:12:03.556 --> 1:12:07.960
You know when you have a near-death experience
and you have that moment of clarity?

1:12:08.027 --> 1:12:12.564
Well, mine was I don't
wanna end up like Ted Garvin.

1:12:12.631 --> 1:12:14.233
That's it?

1:12:14.333 --> 1:12:15.666
Whadya mean, that's it?

1:12:15.733 --> 1:12:17.568
I don't know.

1:12:17.668 --> 1:12:23.008
Seems like a near-death experience
would give you more than that.

1:12:23.075 --> 1:12:24.408
Jesus.

1:12:24.508 --> 1:12:27.545
All right. How about...

1:12:27.577 --> 1:12:30.748
I wanna end up with Caroline.

1:12:36.519 --> 1:12:40.923
Wow. Well,
how you gonna do that?

1:12:40.956 --> 1:12:43.492
Well, uh, all right.

1:12:43.559 --> 1:12:49.663
When does that arts and crafts class
start at your senior living facility?

1:12:49.729 --> 1:12:51.566
In about 45 minutes.

1:12:51.598 --> 1:12:53.067
Take me to my room.

1:12:53.101 --> 1:12:54.601
All right.

1:12:56.036 --> 1:12:57.370
Okay.

1:13:02.209 --> 1:13:03.210
What are you doin'?

1:13:03.276 --> 1:13:05.211
Get that. Get that.

1:13:05.277 --> 1:13:06.445
- What?
- Get the...

1:13:06.545 --> 1:13:07.679
Get the thing off!

1:13:11.283 --> 1:13:12.951
Help me out with my pants.

1:13:13.017 --> 1:13:14.352
Okay, what? What?
What do you want?

1:13:14.419 --> 1:13:15.353
Awkward.

1:13:15.420 --> 1:13:16.588
- Huh?
- Awkward.

1:13:16.620 --> 1:13:18.622
Awkward. Awkward. Jesus.

1:13:18.689 --> 1:13:21.892
Your feet are clammy.

1:13:21.959 --> 1:13:22.893
Yuck.

1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:23.961
What's yuck?

1:13:24.027 --> 1:13:25.462
That's it.

1:13:25.562 --> 1:13:27.597
What're you doin'?

1:13:27.629 --> 1:13:29.398
I got a plan.

1:13:30.466 --> 1:13:31.567
<i>Uh...</i>

1:13:31.633 --> 1:13:32.568
<i>Ooh.</i>

1:13:34.137 --> 1:13:35.971
So sorry. Um...

1:13:36.071 --> 1:13:37.973
<i>If I may have
your attention, please.</i>

1:13:38.073 --> 1:13:41.877
<i>Uh, unfortunately, Ms. Wilson,
uh, couldn't make it,</i>

1:13:41.943 --> 1:13:47.481
<i>so I'm going to be your
interim project coordinator.</i>

1:13:47.548 --> 1:13:49.483
There ya go.

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:52.585
All right.

1:13:52.651 --> 1:13:55.822
<i>How many of you,
uh, like tortoises?</i>

1:13:55.922 --> 1:13:57.323
<i>Oh, great. That's great.</i>

1:13:57.423 --> 1:14:01.426
<i>So Let me tell you
what I have in mind.</i>

1:14:04.329 --> 1:14:06.431
Now ya got it. Now ya got it.

1:14:06.498 --> 1:14:09.901
Oh, yeah, baby! Come on!

1:14:09.967 --> 1:14:12.170
This is gonna be terrific.

1:14:12.270 --> 1:14:13.171
Some more over there.

1:14:13.237 --> 1:14:14.472
That's wonderful.

1:14:15.972 --> 1:14:18.175
Yes. That's fantastic.

1:14:18.275 --> 1:14:21.677
Whoa. That is wonderful.

1:14:23.612 --> 1:14:26.348
Yeah, that's it. That's good.

1:14:36.024 --> 1:14:38.692
<i>Lonesome George was the last</i>

1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:40.761
<i>of the Pinta Island Tortoises.</i>

1:14:40.827 --> 1:14:42.529
<i>He passed away
on June 24th, 2012.</i>

1:14:42.629 --> 1:14:44.031
Wait, wait, wait!

1:14:44.131 --> 1:14:45.698
Please. Please.

1:14:45.766 --> 1:14:46.699
Give us a chance.

1:14:46.767 --> 1:14:47.867
Ten more minutes.

1:14:47.967 --> 1:14:49.101
We're expecting a large crowd.

1:14:49.168 --> 1:14:49.936
I promise.

1:14:50.002 --> 1:14:52.271
Just five more minutes. Yeah?

1:14:52.338 --> 1:14:54.974
<i>So when we say,
Save the Tortoise,</i>

1:14:55.041 --> 1:14:57.375
<i>what we're also saying is,
Save Us.</i>

1:14:57.475 --> 1:14:58.376
<i>All of us.</i>

1:14:58.476 --> 1:14:59.978
<i>You. Me.</i>

1:15:00.045 --> 1:15:02.847
<i>Our kids. Our grandchildren.</i>

1:15:02.881 --> 1:15:05.950
<i>Because when we allow a species
this important</i>

1:15:06.016 --> 1:15:09.053
<i>to a healthy environment
to die out,</i>

1:15:09.119 --> 1:15:11.388
<i>then we have to ask ourselves:</i>

1:15:11.455 --> 1:15:12.789
<i>What's next?</i>

1:15:12.855 --> 1:15:14.490
<i>Who's next?</i>

1:15:14.557 --> 1:15:17.160
<i>Thank you. Thanks a lot.</i>

1:15:22.731 --> 1:15:24.032
That was wonderful.

1:15:24.066 --> 1:15:25.734
Oh, I thought we'd have
a bigger turnout.

1:15:25.834 --> 1:15:28.336
Well, it's all right.

1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:33.574
Are you getting this?

1:15:33.674 --> 1:15:35.475
What's that?

1:15:39.913 --> 1:15:40.914
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

1:15:40.981 --> 1:15:42.482
<i>I live in the desert</i>

1:15:42.549 --> 1:15:45.584
<i>and I don't do much
most of the time.</i>

1:15:45.684 --> 1:15:46.852
<i>It's too hot out here.</i>

1:15:46.919 --> 1:15:48.654
<i>So I dig underground burrows</i>

1:15:48.722 --> 1:15:52.557
<i>where I spend
a good part of my life.</i>

1:15:52.590 --> 1:15:54.759
<i>I can live up to 30 years,
just like a human,</i>

1:15:54.859 --> 1:15:56.394
<i>and I grow slow.</i>

1:15:56.427 --> 1:15:58.229
<i>Very slowly.</i>

1:15:58.263 --> 1:16:00.497
<i>After many centuries
on this earth,</i>

1:16:00.564 --> 1:16:04.835
<i>I am now classified
as a vulnerable species.</i>

1:16:04.901 --> 1:16:07.371
- Oh, no!
- Oh, shit!

1:16:10.673 --> 1:16:12.208
Oh, my gosh!

1:16:19.914 --> 1:16:21.216
Ms. Summers, for KMIR news,

1:16:21.283 --> 1:16:23.118
just a few words
about your organization...

1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:36.929
It's Save the Tortoises,
the desert tortoises.

1:16:36.963 --> 1:16:38.798
They're an endangered species
and...

1:16:46.471 --> 1:16:49.473
What a disaster.

1:16:49.573 --> 1:16:52.643
Yeah. Oh, well.

1:16:55.879 --> 1:16:57.480
Let's go home, my friend.

1:16:57.580 --> 1:16:58.716
Yeah.

1:17:07.724 --> 1:17:10.659
I believe we lose
a little bit of our soul

1:17:10.727 --> 1:17:13.928
when we lose
the natural world.

1:17:24.071 --> 1:17:26.640
<i>Breaking news.
KMIR exclusive.</i>

1:17:26.673 --> 1:17:29.008
<i>Today at the tortoise rally.</i>

1:17:29.108 --> 1:17:31.977
- <i>Oh, no!</i>
- <i>Oh, shit!</i>

1:17:32.011 --> 1:17:36.414
<i>It just kept going up
and up and up and up.</i>

1:17:36.481 --> 1:17:38.450
<i>Forecast, plenty
of sunshine through today</i>

1:17:38.516 --> 1:17:41.453
<i>with seasonal temperatures,
strong southwesterly winds...</i>

1:17:43.620 --> 1:17:45.255
Come on, baby.

1:17:45.322 --> 1:17:46.357
What's up, dude?

1:17:46.423 --> 1:17:47.691
Hey, dude.

1:17:49.860 --> 1:17:51.694
Hey. Hey, dude.

1:17:51.762 --> 1:17:53.596
Hey, little dude.

1:17:53.663 --> 1:17:54.664
Hey, little dude.

1:17:54.698 --> 1:17:56.099
Dude, last time I checked,

1:17:56.165 --> 1:17:58.769
your video had over
a half a million hits.

1:17:58.836 --> 1:17:59.968
It's blowin' up!

1:18:01.670 --> 1:18:02.971
Is that...
Is that good?

1:18:03.038 --> 1:18:03.872
Oh, yes.

1:18:03.939 --> 1:18:06.975
It means you're a celebrity.

1:18:07.042 --> 1:18:08.376
It's amazing.

1:18:08.442 --> 1:18:10.311
It's popular?

1:18:10.378 --> 1:18:11.713
Half a million hits.

1:18:11.813 --> 1:18:13.815
I thought it was, uh...

1:18:13.881 --> 1:18:14.915
You mean it's...

1:18:14.982 --> 1:18:16.316
It's definitely this.

1:18:16.383 --> 1:18:17.785
It's definitely this.

1:18:17.852 --> 1:18:19.152
You're the dude.

1:18:19.219 --> 1:18:20.520
Holy...

1:18:20.553 --> 1:18:21.789
Thank you.

1:18:42.906 --> 1:18:44.074
That's it!

1:18:48.911 --> 1:18:50.346
It's okay. It's okay.

1:19:05.693 --> 1:19:09.430
Make a righthand turn
out of the lot.

1:19:09.496 --> 1:19:10.330
That's it!

1:19:15.736 --> 1:19:19.371
Okay. I'm looking both ways.

1:19:19.438 --> 1:19:21.373
I'm looking back.

1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:22.742
I'm clear.

1:19:22.775 --> 1:19:25.444
I've got my turn signals on.

1:19:25.544 --> 1:19:26.545
Away I go.

1:19:26.611 --> 1:19:28.345
I'm turning.

1:19:28.412 --> 1:19:30.715
I see a car in the back.

1:19:30.782 --> 1:19:32.349
I don't see any more cars.

1:19:32.416 --> 1:19:34.920
I'm ready and clear.

1:19:36.854 --> 1:19:37.755
What are you doing?

1:19:37.788 --> 1:19:39.857
I'm sorry, Mr. Mipps.

1:19:39.924 --> 1:19:42.025
I'm sorry.

1:20:07.580 --> 1:20:09.148
Save the tortoise.

1:20:19.557 --> 1:20:23.227
<i>Permit holder,
report to the front desk.</i>

1:20:24.595 --> 1:20:25.964
I'm not sure.

1:20:25.996 --> 1:20:28.499
I don't know.

1:20:28.565 --> 1:20:29.500
Did it look good?

1:20:29.566 --> 1:20:31.001
Yeah.

1:20:33.336 --> 1:20:36.672
Why isn't Mipps comin' out?

1:20:36.773 --> 1:20:37.673
I don't know.

1:20:37.774 --> 1:20:39.842
Oh, hold on.

1:20:39.942 --> 1:20:41.076
Yeah.

1:20:48.750 --> 1:20:50.351
Congratulations.

1:21:00.326 --> 1:21:02.262
Hey. Hey, Mipps, come here.

1:21:09.936 --> 1:21:12.671
What do you say?

1:21:12.704 --> 1:21:14.539
- Thanks.
- You bet.

1:21:14.605 --> 1:21:15.874
I got your license back.

1:21:15.941 --> 1:21:17.642
I got your car back,
the love of your life.

1:21:17.709 --> 1:21:21.211
That's what I did.
I gave you your life back.

1:21:38.861 --> 1:21:40.896
Victor?

1:21:41.797 --> 1:21:42.898
Vic?

1:21:43.965 --> 1:21:46.133
Victor?

1:22:29.839 --> 1:22:31.539
Mom?

1:22:31.606 --> 1:22:35.176
I'm coming.

1:22:40.513 --> 1:22:41.716
Victor.

1:22:41.782 --> 1:22:43.383
Mom?

1:22:43.450 --> 1:22:45.086
I believe you've met Sonia.

1:22:45.118 --> 1:22:46.721
Sonia, remember Victor?

1:22:46.787 --> 1:22:48.788
Nice to see you again.

1:22:48.888 --> 1:22:50.522
You want some strudel?

1:22:53.125 --> 1:22:55.694
Sonia, will you please get
Victor a piece of strudel?

1:22:59.031 --> 1:23:01.232
So did you come here
for a reason?

1:23:01.299 --> 1:23:03.634
I got my license back.

1:23:03.735 --> 1:23:05.469
I'm not sure I like that.

1:23:07.204 --> 1:23:09.874
I'd like to take you
for a ride.

1:23:09.941 --> 1:23:11.641
Would you?

1:23:11.742 --> 1:23:14.210
So now you want me
and the car.

1:23:16.079 --> 1:23:18.147
- Victor, you don't...
- Listen...

1:23:20.716 --> 1:23:21.650
Enjoy it.

1:23:25.721 --> 1:23:27.989
Amore.

1:23:28.089 --> 1:23:29.590
Oh, you're leaving?

1:23:29.658 --> 1:23:30.759
- Yes.
- Oh.

1:23:36.664 --> 1:23:37.597
Thank you so much.

1:23:37.665 --> 1:23:38.666
Thank you.

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:41.634
Victor.

1:23:49.474 --> 1:23:50.609
Diego.

1:23:50.677 --> 1:23:54.412
Let me introduce you
to Brian, my husband.

1:24:02.153 --> 1:24:03.788
Hi, Victor.

1:24:03.854 --> 1:24:05.956
Hello, Brian.

1:24:06.023 --> 1:24:07.256
It's a pleasure.

1:24:07.322 --> 1:24:08.424
He's gorgeous, I know.

1:24:08.490 --> 1:24:10.694
Listen, about that painting...

1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:12.528
almost done.

1:24:12.628 --> 1:24:14.196
Oh, okay. Thanks.

1:24:14.263 --> 1:24:15.931
Okay, let's go.

1:24:15.998 --> 1:24:17.700
See you soon.

1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:19.267
See ya.

1:24:24.105 --> 1:24:25.707
I've been an idiot.

1:24:25.773 --> 1:24:27.374
Again.

1:24:29.110 --> 1:24:30.210
Yes, you have.

1:24:36.817 --> 1:24:39.350
I owe you an apology.

1:24:42.655 --> 1:24:45.356
Shut up, Victor Martin.

1:24:59.837 --> 1:25:02.371
Hey.

1:25:02.405 --> 1:25:03.706
Hi.

1:25:03.740 --> 1:25:05.407
Lookin' good.

1:25:09.846 --> 1:25:10.747
Good morning.

1:25:14.983 --> 1:25:18.252
Ayayayayay!

1:25:18.319 --> 1:25:20.855
Torres, Caroline.
Caroline, Torres.

1:25:20.921 --> 1:25:22.255
Nice to meet you.

1:25:22.322 --> 1:25:23.991
Oh, a gentleman.

1:25:24.058 --> 1:25:25.659
Thank you, señorita.

1:25:25.726 --> 1:25:28.728
What's up, Vic?
Wanna start her up?

1:25:28.762 --> 1:25:29.863
Hold on.

1:25:39.037 --> 1:25:41.039
Why don't you
do the honors?

1:25:41.106 --> 1:25:42.406
You serious?

1:25:45.910 --> 1:25:46.844
Yeah.

1:25:56.519 --> 1:25:58.054
You hear that?

1:25:58.121 --> 1:26:00.189
Just like new. Ooh.

1:26:00.256 --> 1:26:01.791
Yeah.

1:26:03.793 --> 1:26:05.961
Why don't you take her out
for a test drive?

1:26:06.061 --> 1:26:07.896
Now you're playin' with me.

1:26:07.962 --> 1:26:11.199
No. Why don't you try her?

1:26:11.266 --> 1:26:13.635
See if you like her.

1:26:13.735 --> 1:26:17.436
And if you do, if you're
happy, make me an offer.

1:26:17.470 --> 1:26:19.973
I'm sure we can come up
with a payment schedule.

1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:23.976
Whoa. Now hold on. This...

1:26:24.076 --> 1:26:26.112
This is your car, Victor.

1:26:26.145 --> 1:26:28.281
You know, your baby.

1:26:28.313 --> 1:26:29.982
Why would you
ever wanna sell it?

1:26:30.049 --> 1:26:32.651
Let alone to me?

1:26:41.491 --> 1:26:46.996
'Cause I have already
found myself my baby.

1:27:31.669 --> 1:27:33.972
Hey.

1:27:34.038 --> 1:27:35.706
It's dipshit.

1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:39.042
Oh, no.
Don't even think about it.

1:27:39.142 --> 1:27:40.543
Fasten your seatbelt.

1:27:40.610 --> 1:27:42.112
- Victor!
- Here we go!

1:27:42.179 --> 1:27:44.847
Oh, gosh!

1:28:01.662 --> 1:28:07.734
Yahoo! Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo-hoo!
