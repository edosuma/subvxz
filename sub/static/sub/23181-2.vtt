You're having
some beers in the barn

00:11.733 --> 00:13.600
with your pals
the other day...

00:13.633 --> 00:15.166
So, have you figured out
what you're gonna do

00:15.200 --> 00:17.366
as first act of Ag Hall
President there, super shoots?

00:17.400 --> 00:19.133
You're looking at it,
pea shoots.

00:19.166 --> 00:21.033
No, he's talking about
a charitable act, big shooter.

00:21.066 --> 00:22.633
We'll advise you there,
shoots and ladders.

00:22.666 --> 00:23.666
We'll be your team,

00:23.700 --> 00:25.100
‐half court shooter.
‐K.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.500
Like when Obamas
became president,

00:26.533 --> 00:27.633
he started
bringing troops home.

00:27.666 --> 00:29.100
Oh, is that what he did?

00:29.133 --> 00:30.266
Or when Trudeau
became Prime Minister,

00:30.300 --> 00:31.800
he started bringing
refugees over.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.400
Oh, did he do that?

00:33.433 --> 00:35.233
Whatever you do, just make
sure peoples know about it.

00:35.266 --> 00:36.633
Yeah, like you're gonna want
to have somebody

00:36.666 --> 00:38.500
come down from the paper,
take a photo of it.

00:38.533 --> 00:41.200
‐Tweet a tweet, snap a chat.
‐Why?

00:41.233 --> 00:42.566
Well, if it's not
in the papers

00:42.600 --> 00:44.366
or on the Internets,
it's pretty much worthless.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.633
DARYL: You know what I think,
we should almost be

00:45.666 --> 00:47.200
snapping a chat
about us talking about doing

00:47.233 --> 00:48.733
‐the charitables right now.
‐Pump the brakes.

00:48.766 --> 00:50.200
Now, am I doing
the charitables

00:50.233 --> 00:52.500
for the charity's gain
or my own?

00:52.533 --> 00:54.566
Well, you do the charitables
for the charity,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.100
but the whole point
of doing the charitables

00:56.133 --> 00:57.333
is that people think
you're a good guy

00:57.366 --> 00:58.533
for being charitable.

00:58.566 --> 00:59.633
Yeah, behaving charitably,

00:59.666 --> 01:01.333
you'll have
people saying, like,

01:01.366 --> 01:03.233
‐"Oh, he's a good guy."
‐"Oh, he's a real good guy."

01:03.266 --> 01:04.766
‐"Oh, he's a great guy."
‐No!

01:04.800 --> 01:07.300
I think you have had
too much sugar cereal.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.100
The whole point
of doing the charitables

01:09.133 --> 01:11.366
is to help the charity
and to make you feel good,

01:11.400 --> 01:13.466
not look good. Figure it out.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.366
Yeah, but it feels good
to have people call you

01:15.400 --> 01:17.133
a real good guy.
You figure it out.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.533
Oh, it feels even gooder
when someone says

01:18.566 --> 01:19.733
you're a great guy.
You figure it out.

01:19.766 --> 01:21.200
You want to do a charitable?

01:21.233 --> 01:22.666
Drive into town
first thing in the morning,

01:22.700 --> 01:24.533
dead of winter,
after a fresh snow fall.

01:24.566 --> 01:26.233
Shovel a handful
of folks' driveways

01:26.266 --> 01:27.433
before they wake up.

01:27.466 --> 01:29.300
No one does a tweet.
Feels fuckin' sweet.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.800
Also, it's a substantial
core workout,

01:30.833 --> 01:32.133
from what I've been told.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.366
Or if you're done
doing hay for the day,

01:34.400 --> 01:35.766
drive on over
to someone's place

01:35.800 --> 01:37.466
that isn't done
doing hay for the day,

01:37.500 --> 01:38.766
cut their grass
or something like that.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.766
No one snaps a chat.
Go fuck your hat.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.366
Or couldn't you
just help them do hay?

01:42.400 --> 01:44.566
‐But gets a photo.
‐You're gonna need a photo.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.066
You wanna know what?

01:46.100 --> 01:47.500

a preachy Patrick,

01:47.533 --> 01:49.333

on the seat here.

Well, no one likes
an impracticals Pete.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.700
No one likes
an unprepared Paul.

01:52.733 --> 01:54.100
Or if you're a woman,

01:54.133 --> 01:55.700
no one likes
an unproductive Pams.

01:55.733 --> 01:56.800
Or an improper Pippa.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.466
No one likes
a pestering Preston.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.166
Or if you're a woman, no one
likes a patronizing Peggy.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.366
Trust me, good buddies,

02:02.400 --> 02:04.200
any charitables act,
big or small,

02:04.233 --> 02:07.400
is an act wasted if your face
ain't attached to it.

02:07.433 --> 02:10.233
‐Any charitable act?
‐Any charitables act.

Let's drive into town.

Well, actually
if you are interested...

07:44.909 --> 07:47.175
Just kidding,
I don't give a fuck.

07:47.209 --> 07:48.675
Nice to see you, buddy.

Don't listen to her, Devon.

07:53.442 --> 07:54.575
They wanted you
to go to law school.

08:15.642 --> 08:17.642
‐How are ya now?
‐Spanking!

08:18.909 --> 08:20.642
Not so bad.

08:20.675 --> 08:22.375
Are you the creator
of Fartbook?

08:22.409 --> 08:25.209
I am the sole creator
of Fartbook!

08:25.242 --> 08:26.709
Cocksucking love that
Fartbook, that's all I know.

08:26.742 --> 08:28.675
‐Thank you.
‐Good farts.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.475
Now listen,
I'm running against Wayne

08:30.509 --> 08:31.909
for the presidency
of the Ag Hall

08:31.942 --> 08:33.475
and was wondering
if I could commission you,

08:33.509 --> 08:36.342
and him, too, to make us
a sort of a campaign video.

08:36.375 --> 08:39.275
You are running against Wayne.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.675
Cocksucking right, he is.

08:40.709 --> 08:43.709
Hurting Wayne hurts Katy.
Hurting Katy hurts Stewart.

08:46.375 --> 08:50.542
It can be done
and it will be done!

08:54.675 --> 08:56.209
Make it stop. Make it stop.

08:56.242 --> 08:57.542
Okay. Okay. All right.

08:57.575 --> 08:59.809
So, look, whatever...
Whatever is good.

08:59.842 --> 09:01.342
I just wanted to know that
we're on the same page,

09:01.375 --> 09:03.142
all right?
I want it to be a sort of a...

09:03.175 --> 09:04.475
Like a good old...

09:04.509 --> 09:05.842
Smear campaign.

09:07.509 --> 09:08.909
‐What's that?
‐It's when you run ads

09:08.942 --> 09:11.709
suggesting negative things
about your opponents.

09:11.742 --> 09:14.642
‐For what purpose?
‐To make yourself look good

09:14.675 --> 09:17.309
by making
your opponent look bad.

09:17.342 --> 09:18.709
Oh, if you got
nothing good to say,

09:18.742 --> 09:20.209
you shouldn't
say nothing at all.

09:20.242 --> 09:21.609
You must acknowledge
the appetite for negativity

09:21.642 --> 09:23.242
in today's world.

09:23.275 --> 09:26.475
The misfortune of others,
it's become sustenance.

09:26.509 --> 09:28.809
You must evolve
from your primitive thinking.

09:28.842 --> 09:30.742

09:30.775 --> 09:33.609

has commissioned Devon et al,

09:35.542 --> 09:37.475
to make a video
for his campaign.

‐I suggest you follow suit.
‐What sort of video?

to do this week.

than name‐calling.

The dog's in the barn,

09:56.642 --> 09:57.909

hurl some insults.

09:57.942 --> 09:59.475

of this cinematic experience

is to influence voters.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.575

as many ethnicities
as possible

10:29.509 --> 10:32.509
with our message
about Wayne, which is...

ALL: He's just not ready.

10:35.309 --> 10:36.742
‐That's good.
‐DEVON: Right.

10:36.775 --> 10:38.542
He's just not ready to be
president of the Ag Hall.

10:38.575 --> 10:40.442
Um...

10:40.475 --> 10:44.142
There aren't any ethnicities
on the Ag Hall board.

10:44.175 --> 10:45.875
‐But there will be.
‐Okay, but why?

10:47.242 --> 10:49.675
‐Because it's 2015.

ever seen The Simpsons?

‐Excellent.

ever seen The Karate Kid?

Girls gone wild.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.579
(GASPS)

16:56.046 --> 16:57.846
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:57.879 --> 17:00.879
It's not complicated!

17:00.912 --> 17:04.246
We want to slander McMurray
so Wayne can win the election

17:04.279 --> 17:07.012
and I can beat
Devon's view count.

17:07.046 --> 17:10.312
Now, let's try this.

17:10.346 --> 17:12.146
Think about
your favorite actor

17:12.179 --> 17:13.679
and try to channel them.

17:15.112 --> 17:18.146
Who are your
favorite actors? Go!

17:18.179 --> 17:19.646
Kevin Costner.

17:19.679 --> 17:20.812
Keanu Reeves.

17:20.846 --> 17:21.979
John Candy.

17:23.179 --> 17:25.012
Chloe Sevigny.

17:25.046 --> 17:26.779
It's easy.
Taylor Kitsch, boys.

17:26.812 --> 17:28.079
Big Riggins himself.

17:28.112 --> 17:28.879
You picked Big Riggins,

17:28.912 --> 17:30.212
so I'll take Michael
Fassbender, bro.

17:30.246 --> 17:31.312
Yeah. But if...

17:31.346 --> 17:33.146
If Big Riggins,
if he's not available,

17:33.179 --> 17:34.812
'cause he's my number one,

17:34.846 --> 17:36.212
it's easy,
Chad Michael Murray, boys.

17:36.246 --> 17:38.146
Big Riggins
is still my number one

17:38.179 --> 17:39.946
but I love Chaz Michael, bro.

17:39.979 --> 17:41.579
‐One Tree Hill!
‐Boom!

17:41.612 --> 17:43.212
Go with Michael Fassbender.

17:43.246 --> 17:45.679
‐Try channeling that.
‐Choose Big Riggins.

17:45.712 --> 17:47.179
DAN: You know what?

17:47.212 --> 17:49.179
Actors named Michael could
really reinvent themselves

17:49.212 --> 17:51.712
if they change their names
to Spike, like uh,

17:51.746 --> 17:55.246
Spike Fassbenders
or, uh, Spike Caine

17:55.279 --> 17:57.146
or Spike J. Fox.

17:57.179 --> 17:59.246
‐Spike Buble.
‐Chaz Spike Murray?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.246
Oh, C. Spike Murray?

18:01.279 --> 18:03.612
Let's try and stay on task!

18:03.646 --> 18:04.946
Well, now it might
be kind of awkward,

18:04.979 --> 18:06.712
might be kind of awkward
if actors named Richards

18:06.746 --> 18:08.112
started going by Dick.

18:08.146 --> 18:10.779
Right? Like Dick Gere.
Dick Pryor.

18:10.812 --> 18:13.079
‐Dick Dreyfuss...
‐Lionel Dick.

18:13.112 --> 18:15.579
Feel like Richard Simmons
probably prefers Dick.

18:15.612 --> 18:16.912
(SHRIEKS)

18:20.846 --> 18:22.279
Dude, he got fucking mad.

18:22.312 --> 18:25.112
Well, looks like
she's back to cutting lawns.

18:32.842 --> 18:34.875
(AUCTIONEERING)
All those for Wayne

18:34.908 --> 18:37.842
resuming presidency
of the Ag Hall...

18:37.875 --> 18:39.942
Can I get a one vote here?
We got one over here...

18:39.975 --> 18:41.475
Now can I get a two?
Two‐dollar bill...

18:41.508 --> 18:43.175
Two over here
now can I get a three...

18:43.208 --> 18:44.408
Looking at three,
three over here,

18:44.442 --> 18:45.942
now can I get a four?
Looking for a four...

18:45.975 --> 18:48.275
Wayne for President for four?

18:48.308 --> 18:50.942
No four. Three for Wayne.

18:50.975 --> 18:56.275
Those for McMurray reclaiming
presidency of the Ag Hall,

18:56.308 --> 18:57.708
can I get a one vote here,
looking for one‐dollar bill.

18:57.742 --> 18:59.308
We got one over here,
one over here!

18:59.342 --> 19:00.542
Now can I get a two,

19:00.575 --> 19:01.742
looking for a two,
two over here!

19:01.775 --> 19:03.175
Now can I get a three,
looking at a three?

19:03.208 --> 19:04.408
Three over here,
we're looking at three,

19:04.442 --> 19:06.642
can I get a four,
looking for a four.

19:06.675 --> 19:07.908
Four over here,
now can I get a five?

19:07.942 --> 19:09.442
Five‐dollar bill,
looking for a five.

19:09.475 --> 19:10.575
Five over here,
now can I get a six?

19:10.608 --> 19:11.675
Six dollars,
looking for a six,

19:11.708 --> 19:13.342
six over here!
Now can I get a seven?

19:13.375 --> 19:15.375
Seven right here, you can
tell by the way he uses

19:15.408 --> 19:16.842
his walk he's a woman's man.

19:16.875 --> 19:19.742
Sold! Majority rules.

19:19.775 --> 19:22.542
Presidency awarded
to McMurray.

19:22.575 --> 19:23.808
(LAUGHING)

19:27.408 --> 19:28.708
Come on, baby. Come here.

19:28.742 --> 19:31.708
(GRUNTING) Yeah, yeah, yeah!

19:31.742 --> 19:34.608
Okay. You gotta act classy.
Now you're the First Lady.

19:35.775 --> 19:39.842
McMurray, Mrs. McMurray,
congratulations.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.342
Thanks, Wayne.

19:42.708 --> 19:44.542
P'zazz is all cleared up
and everything.

19:44.575 --> 19:45.808
I'm back to my old self again.

19:45.842 --> 19:48.875
‐Glad to hear. Best of luck.
‐Appreciate it.

19:48.908 --> 19:50.808
Let's go get a couple
of cocksucking G&Ts,

19:50.842 --> 19:52.542
that's what I always say.

19:52.575 --> 19:54.542
Okay, girl, let's do it.

19:56.308 --> 19:58.475
Sorry, I couldn't vote
for you, Wayne.

19:58.508 --> 20:00.908
Your video
really threw me off.

20:00.942 --> 20:02.442
Thanks for cutting
my lawn, though.

20:02.475 --> 20:03.942
I'll return the favor one day.

20:03.975 --> 20:05.342
Good enough, Jim.

20:16.308 --> 20:17.808
Stewart's YouTube page.

(SLOW POP PLAYING)

20:32.608 --> 20:34.542
McMurray's a piece of shit.

20:34.575 --> 20:36.608
McMurray's a piece of shit.

20:36.642 --> 20:38.208
McMurray's a piece of shit?

20:38.242 --> 20:40.208
Why would I say
McMurray's a piece of shit?

20:41.308 --> 20:42.808
All right,
he's a piece of shit.

‐Hello?
‐Yo.

‐What's up, B?
‐Nothing. Chilling.

‐What's up with you?
‐McMurray's a piece of shit.

20:54.275 --> 20:55.408
True.

What's up?

21:00.242 --> 21:02.208
What up?

21:02.242 --> 21:04.642
‐Yo, who's that?
‐Yo, pick up the phone.

21:06.442 --> 21:07.942
What up?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.742
What's up?

21:09.775 --> 21:11.408

21:11.442 --> 21:12.708
(IN A DEEP VOICE) What up?

21:29.342 --> 21:30.742
I mean, this is no fun, boys.

21:30.775 --> 21:32.275
Team No‐Fun, boys.

21:32.308 --> 21:33.642
We gotta start giving
it back to them

21:33.675 --> 21:35.608
or they're just gonna fucking
walk all over us, buddy.

21:35.642 --> 21:36.875
Yeah, but where
do we start, buddy?

21:36.908 --> 21:38.308
(DOOR OPENS)

What the fuck is that, boys?

21:42.475 --> 21:44.275
Yo, you leave the house
like that, buddy?

21:44.308 --> 21:47.408
‐What's the problem, Schmelt?
‐You got a fucking bush, bud.

21:47.442 --> 21:49.275
You got a bush, bud.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.542
Who's the bush inspector
around here, boys?

21:51.575 --> 21:53.375
Bush inspector's
sleeping on shift, boys.

21:53.408 --> 21:55.942
On our junior team it's
a five‐dollar fine every game

21:55.975 --> 21:57.942
and praccy 'til she's shaved
down to the wood, boys.

21:57.975 --> 21:59.875
Hey, get that hedge hog
off your tummy stick, bud.

21:59.908 --> 22:01.275
You're fucking gross, bud.

22:01.308 --> 22:03.808
You're fucking gross, bud.

22:03.842 --> 22:05.942
Looks like we got a couple
of cock‐lookers, Yorkie.

22:05.975 --> 22:09.175
Of course, the Schmelts like
a good cock‐look, Barts.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.542
Oh, yeah,
I fucking cock‐looked

22:10.575 --> 22:12.208
'cause your junk's
a fucking car crash

22:12.242 --> 22:13.342
and you can't look away.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.408
I cock‐looked 'cause your
junk's a fucking strobe light.

22:15.442 --> 22:17.375
I can see it
with my eyes closed!

22:17.408 --> 22:19.675
So you were cock‐looking.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.875
They just admitted
they cock‐looked.

22:23.308 --> 22:24.642
Well, I cock‐looked

22:24.675 --> 22:25.942
'cause your junk's a fucking
welding flame, buddy.

22:25.975 --> 22:27.408
You look directly at it

22:27.442 --> 22:28.742
and your fucking retinas
getting burned.

22:28.775 --> 22:30.475
I cock‐looked because
your junk's a fucking child

22:30.508 --> 22:31.675
walking in on his parents.
Once you see it,

22:31.708 --> 22:32.875
it cannot be unseen.

22:32.908 --> 22:34.242
All this time cock‐looking

22:34.275 --> 22:36.175
could be better spent
doing legs.

22:36.208 --> 22:38.442
More legs,
less cock‐looking, Schmelts.

22:42.442 --> 22:44.208
I fucking skipped
leg day, boys.

22:44.242 --> 22:46.275
Fuck leg day, boys!

You are woefully uninformed,
aren't you?

22:57.775 --> 22:59.475
‐How?
‐I said I would beat Devon's

22:59.508 --> 23:01.275
view count,
not win you the election.

23:01.308 --> 23:04.408
And guess what?
I did beat Devon's view count.

23:04.442 --> 23:06.808
‐Look.
‐Oh, I don't give a care.

23:06.842 --> 23:09.208
I've been contacted
by Budweiser and Carl's Jr.

23:09.242 --> 23:11.242
over copyright infringements,

23:11.275 --> 23:13.542
but I don't think
they're serious.

23:13.575 --> 23:14.775
You wanna know what?

23:14.808 --> 23:16.575
McMurray's meetings
are a bit painful,

23:16.608 --> 23:18.375
but not sure
that's good enough reason

23:18.408 --> 23:19.642
to get into politics.

23:19.675 --> 23:21.675
‐They're all crooks.
‐Every one of them.

23:21.708 --> 23:22.942
Now run along, Stewart,

23:22.975 --> 23:24.542
before I get bored
of behaving.

23:25.875 --> 23:28.308
Well, I guess
she's off to chore.

23:28.342 --> 23:29.375

It's Dicks... Nope,
you got it right that time.

23:40.708 --> 23:42.642
‐Good n' you?
‐Not so bad.

23:42.675 --> 23:44.508
I said I'd return the favor
for cutting the lawn.

23:44.542 --> 23:46.642
I figured there's no time
like the present.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.375
Can we give you a hand
with anything?
