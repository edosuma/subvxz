01:46.054 --> 01:47.622
HEY, THERE
ARE THE BOYS!

01:47.690 --> 01:48.656
HI.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

01:48.724 --> 01:49.657
MAN,
AM I GLAD TO SEE

01:49.725 --> 01:50.958
SOME REAL
FLESH-AND-BLOOD HUMANS.

01:51.026 --> 01:52.694
10 HOURS OF SITTING
ALONE ON THE COUCH

01:52.761 --> 01:54.429
CAN DO STRANGE THINGS
TO A MAN.

01:54.496 --> 01:56.030
RIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY.

02:00.252 --> 02:01.186
I'M GONNA
GRAB A BEER.

02:01.253 --> 02:03.021
MAKE A PHONE CALL.

02:04.907 --> 02:07.942
GOD, I LOVE
FRIDAY AFTERNOONS.

02:08.009 --> 02:09.211
I FEEL
LIKE AN ARTIST

02:09.277 --> 02:11.145
AND THE WEEKEND THAT LIES
AHEAD, THAT'S MY CANVAS.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.146
SO, WHAT'VE
YOU GOT PLANNED?

02:12.215 --> 02:14.749
A LOT OF NAPS.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

02:14.817 --> 02:17.719
ACTUALLY, I TOLD O'BOYLE
I'D WORK A HALF DAY TOMORROW.

02:17.786 --> 02:20.088
YOU VOLUNTEERED TO WORK ON A SATURDAY?

02:20.155 --> 02:22.724
LOSER!

02:22.791 --> 02:24.359
HEY. KELLY'S GOT
THE KIDS THIS WEEKEND,

02:24.427 --> 02:26.894
AND GOING TO WORK BEATS
SITTING AT HOME IN MY APARTMENT

02:26.962 --> 02:27.962
LISTENING TO THE ECHO

02:28.030 --> 02:29.797
OF WHAT A FAMILY
USED TO SOUND LIKE.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.351
LOSER.

02:33.418 --> 02:36.187
ANYWAY, I SHOULD
GET ROLLING.

02:37.689 --> 02:39.623
HEY.

02:39.691 --> 02:41.559
DEACON.

02:41.626 --> 02:44.278
HEY, CARRIE.
COME HERE.

02:45.347 --> 02:47.281
COME ON.

02:47.349 --> 02:49.283
AH!

02:49.351 --> 02:52.019
OH, YEAH! THAT'S
THE GOOD STUFF.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.255
ALL RIGHT, GET ON OUT
OF HERE, YOU BIG LUG.

02:54.323 --> 02:55.256
GO ON.

02:55.324 --> 02:56.657
RIGHT, UH...

02:56.725 --> 02:58.560
SEE YA.

02:59.628 --> 03:00.562
DO YOU HAVE
TO HIT ON HIM

03:00.629 --> 03:01.662
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF ME?

03:01.730 --> 03:02.730
SHH.

03:05.334 --> 03:06.468
THEY'RE GETTING BACK
TOGETHER.

03:06.535 --> 03:07.469
WHO?

03:07.536 --> 03:08.636
WHO? WHO DO YOU THINK?

03:08.703 --> 03:10.605
VAN HALEN?

03:10.673 --> 03:13.124
DEACON AND KELLY.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.192
WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:14.259 --> 03:15.376
HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

03:15.444 --> 03:16.344
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
KNOW ABOUT IT YET.

03:16.412 --> 03:18.295
I JUST HAD LUNCH
WITH KELLY IN THE CITY,

03:18.363 --> 03:19.764
AND SHE SAID SHE'S DONE
FINDING HERSELF,

03:19.832 --> 03:21.633
LEARNING WHO KELLY IS,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,

03:21.700 --> 03:23.167
AND SHE IS READY
TO COME HOME,

03:23.235 --> 03:25.119
SO WHEN SHE DROPS THE
KIDS OFF SUNDAY NIGHT,

03:25.187 --> 03:27.338
SHE'S GONNA TELL HIM
SHE WANTS TO STAY.

03:27.406 --> 03:28.339
MY GOD.
THAT'S GREAT.

03:28.407 --> 03:29.941
GREAT? COME ON!
IT'S FANTASTIC!

03:30.009 --> 03:33.277
IT IS! THEY FINALLY GET
THEIR FAMILY BACK TOGETHER.

03:33.345 --> 03:34.179
MAN, SEEING THOSE KIDS

03:34.330 --> 03:35.513
PACK UP THEIR LITTLE
UNDEROOS EVERY WEEKEND,

03:35.581 --> 03:37.231
THAT WAS ROUGH.

03:37.299 --> 03:39.050
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHO HAD IT
ROUGH? YOU AND ME, PAL.

03:39.251 --> 03:41.619
HANGING OUT WITH ALL THOSE
OTHER COUPLES THE LAST 2 YEARS.

03:41.687 --> 03:43.521
I HATED ONE
MORE THAN THE NEXT.

03:43.589 --> 03:45.040
REMEMBER THE PERNWORTHS?

03:45.091 --> 03:47.459
OH. "DOUG, WANNA SEE
MY RADIO-CONTROLLED BOAT?"

03:47.526 --> 03:49.561
BBBLTTT! NO!

03:49.628 --> 03:51.563
NO!

03:51.630 --> 03:53.198
GOD.

03:53.265 --> 03:54.015
SO, WHY
IS KELLY WAITING

03:54.083 --> 03:55.166
TILL SUNDAY NIGHT
TO TELL HIM?

03:55.234 --> 03:56.501
SHE'S GOTTA
TAKE THE KIDS

03:56.569 --> 03:58.470
TO VISIT
HER MOTHER UPSTATE.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.039
MAYBE I SHOULD GO OVER THERE
AND TELL HIM MYSELF.

04:02.107 --> 04:05.026
WHAT?! YOU CAN'T DO THAT. WHY NOT?

04:05.093 --> 04:06.294
BECAUSE IT'S BETWEEN
DEACON AND KELLY.

04:06.361 --> 04:08.163
IT'S
A PRIVATE THING.

04:08.230 --> 04:09.998
MEANWHILE, DEACON'S GOTTA BE
MISERABLE FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND?

04:10.066 --> 04:11.399
IT'S 2 DAYS.

04:11.466 --> 04:13.367
LET ME PAINT
A PICTURE FOR YOU, OK?

04:13.435 --> 04:15.269
TONIGHT HE'S LONELY.

04:15.337 --> 04:17.772
HE DRINKS HIMSELF TO SLEEP
HOLDING A LIT CIGARETTE.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.241
HE WAKES UP
IN THE MORNING DEAD!

04:20.309 --> 04:22.994
HE DOESN'T
DRINK OR SMOKE.

04:23.061 --> 04:25.029
AH, OK.
BUT HE SHAVES, RIGHT?

04:25.097 --> 04:26.931
SO HE'S CRYING WHILE HE'S
SHAVING.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.733
THEN CUTS HIS THROAT!
DEAD!

04:28.800 --> 04:30.701
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

04:30.769 --> 04:31.702
HE'S EATING A SANDWICH-

04:31.770 --> 04:33.338
DOUG!

04:33.405 --> 04:34.339
CARRIE, I'M SERIOUS.

04:34.406 --> 04:35.507
LOOK, I MEAN...

04:35.574 --> 04:37.442
THE GUY'S
BEEN A WRECK, OK?

04:37.510 --> 04:38.743
WE GOT A CHANCE
TO HELP HIM OUT HERE.

04:38.810 --> 04:40.245
WHY LET HIM SUFFER?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.965
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:44.033 --> 04:46.634
YOU WANNA GO TELL YOUR FRIEND
THE GOOD NEWS, GO TELL HIM.

04:46.702 --> 04:47.936
ALL RIGHT.

04:48.003 --> 04:50.704
I'LL DO IT TOMORROW.
TRAFFIC'S BRUTAL RIGHT NOW.

04:57.163 --> 04:58.296
COMING.

04:59.431 --> 05:00.531
HOWDY-DOO!

05:00.599 --> 05:01.766
HEY, MAN.
WHAT YOU DOIN' HERE?

05:01.834 --> 05:02.934
JUST DOIN' THE SATURDAY ERRANDS.

05:03.002 --> 05:03.968
THOUGHT
I'D COME OVER HERE,

05:04.036 --> 05:05.603
SEE IF I COULD
LIFT YOUR SPIRITS.

05:08.340 --> 05:12.076
ALTHOUGH YOUR SPIRITS
SEEM PRETTY LIFTED.

05:12.143 --> 05:14.679
YUP. GOT A LITTLE COMPANY
COMING OVER IN A FEW MINUTES.

05:14.747 --> 05:15.980
OH, YEAH? WHO?

05:16.048 --> 05:17.582
OH, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE IT, MAN.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.950
THIS MORNING
I HAD A PICKUP

05:19.017 --> 05:20.452
AT THE AIRPORT
MARRIOTT, RIGHT?

05:20.519 --> 05:22.153
SO I'M STANDING
IN THE LOBBY, WAITING,

05:22.221 --> 05:25.056
AND I GLANCE OVER,
AND THERE, CHECKING IN,

05:25.123 --> 05:28.259
SMILING AT ME, IS THIS
CRAZY HOT STEWARDESS.

05:28.327 --> 05:30.778
SO WE START TALKING. YOU
KNOW, WHATEVER, WHATEVER.

05:30.846 --> 05:31.879
AND SHE'S, LIKE,

05:31.947 --> 05:33.014
"OH, I JUST GOT TRANSFERRED

05:33.082 --> 05:34.082
"TO THE EUROPEAN ROUTE.

05:34.149 --> 05:35.182
"I'M GOING
TO LONDON TOMORROW

05:35.250 --> 05:36.417
AND I WON'T BE BACK
FOR AT LEAST A YEAR."

05:36.485 --> 05:40.321
AND I'M, LIKE,
"THAT'S COOL. THAT'S COOL.

05:40.388 --> 05:42.023
SO, UH, HOW YOU GONNA
SPEND YOUR LAST DAY HERE?"

05:42.157 --> 05:43.741
AND SHE SAYS-
GET THIS-

05:43.808 --> 05:45.676
"ANY SUGGESTIONS?"

05:45.744 --> 05:48.179
HA HA HA!

05:48.247 --> 05:50.932
I MEAN, I'M IN
MY DELIVERY UNIFORM,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.934
SHE'S IN
HER STEWARDESS UNIFORM.

05:53.002 --> 05:56.170
IT WAS LIKE
THE FIRST SCENE IN A PORNO.

05:56.238 --> 05:59.006
SO, LONG STORY SHORT,

05:59.074 --> 06:00.992
WE'RE GOING TO THE MET GAME
THIS AFTERNOON,

06:01.059 --> 06:02.960
AND THEN AFTERWARDS
SHE'S COOKING ME DINNER

06:03.028 --> 06:04.896
HERE, IN MY APARTMENT.

06:04.963 --> 06:09.167
IT'S ON, BABY!
HA HA HA HA!

06:10.885 --> 06:12.420
HUH!

06:12.455 --> 06:14.288
IT'S-IT'S WILD, DOUG.

06:14.356 --> 06:15.573
I'VE BEEN
THROUGH SUCH HELL,

06:15.641 --> 06:17.258
AND THEN TODAY,
OUT OF NOWHERE,

06:17.326 --> 06:20.377
A LITTLE SOMETHIN'- SOMETHIN'
FROM THE MAN UPSTAIRS.

06:20.445 --> 06:22.163
AND THIS
SOMETHIN'- SOMETHIN'

06:22.230 --> 06:24.732
IS DEFINITELY LEAVIN'
THE COUNTRY TOMORROW?

06:24.800 --> 06:25.867
YEAH. WHY?

06:25.934 --> 06:27.719
OOH. BYE.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.559
HOW'D IT GO?

06:34.627 --> 06:36.895
GREAT. STOPPED OFF
AT THE WALGREEN'S,

06:36.962 --> 06:38.296
AND YOU'LL
BE HAPPY TO KNOW

06:38.363 --> 06:41.666
SOMEBODY'S NOSE HAIRS
WILL NOT SURVIVE THE NIGHT.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.484
NO, HOW'D IT GO
AT DEACON'S?

06:43.552 --> 06:44.585
OH, THAT.

06:44.653 --> 06:47.439
UH, I DECIDED NOT
TO TELL HIM AFTER ALL.

06:47.506 --> 06:49.173
YOU DIDN'T
TELL HIM?

06:49.241 --> 06:50.708
NAH.

06:50.776 --> 06:54.078
ALL RIGHT, I NEED SOME KIND
OF CHEESE TO STEP FORWARD.

06:54.146 --> 06:55.345
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

06:55.413 --> 06:56.447
WHY'D YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

06:56.514 --> 06:57.615
I DON'T KNOW.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.483
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID, YOU KNOW,

06:59.551 --> 07:01.351
ABOUT HOW IT'S REALLY
KELLY'S PLACE TO TELL HIM.

07:01.419 --> 07:02.587
THAT WAS
QUITE PERSUASIVE.

07:02.654 --> 07:06.190
SOMETIMES YOUR SHRILL TONE
MASKS A VERY GOOD POINT.

07:06.257 --> 07:08.225
DOUG, I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH KELLY,

07:08.293 --> 07:09.243
AND SHE LIKED
THE IDEA OF, YOU KNOW,

07:09.311 --> 07:10.511
YOU GOING OVER THERE

07:10.579 --> 07:12.413
AND SETTING THE TABLE
FOR HER.

07:12.481 --> 07:14.749
ALL RIGHTY, THEN
I'LL SET A KICK-ASS TABLE

07:14.817 --> 07:16.067
FIRST THING
TOMORROW MORNING.

07:16.134 --> 07:18.519
DOUG, COME ON.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:18.587 --> 07:19.721
WHY'D YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

07:19.788 --> 07:20.855
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
DIDN'T WANT YOUR FRIEND

07:20.922 --> 07:22.557
TO BE MISERABLE
ALL WEEKEND.

07:22.624 --> 07:23.625
HE'S HANGIN' IN THERE.

07:23.692 --> 07:24.893
DOUG!

07:27.596 --> 07:28.980
HEY! ME AGAIN.

07:29.047 --> 07:30.214
HEY,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

07:30.282 --> 07:31.482
YOU GOT A SEC
'CAUSE, UH, ACTUALLY,

07:31.549 --> 07:33.017
I DO WANT TO TALK
TO YOU AFTER ALL.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.652
OK, I THINK WE'RE
GETTING FOOD AT THE GAME

07:34.720 --> 07:37.922
'CAUSE THAT LUNCH MEAT IN YOUR
FRIDGE HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.691
OH, HI.

07:42.811 --> 07:44.378
ALL RIGHT.

07:50.135 --> 07:51.769
AH, DOUGLAS, JUST THE MAN I WANT TO SEE.

07:51.837 --> 07:54.205
PERHAPS YOU COULD HELP ME
FINISH UP MY CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

07:54.272 --> 07:56.573
NOT RIGHT NOW, ARTHUR.

07:56.641 --> 07:58.292
BUT I'M
TANTALIZINGLY CLOSE.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.913
<i>THE FINAL CLUE IS "I DREAM
OF JEANNIE STAR LARRY BLANK."</i>

08:04.466 --> 08:05.717
HAGMAN.

08:05.784 --> 08:07.051
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,
BUT APPARENTLY

08:07.119 --> 08:11.372
THE FIRST 3 LETTERS
ARE B, X, X.

08:12.558 --> 08:13.791
ANYTHING?

08:13.859 --> 08:16.427
WILL YOU PLEASE- I- I GOT
SOMETHING ON MY MIND HERE.

08:16.494 --> 08:20.047
THEN DON'T YOU THINK YOU
SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT, SON?

08:20.115 --> 08:22.182
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.551
YOU GOT A SECOND?

08:23.619 --> 08:25.085
OF COURSE.

08:25.153 --> 08:26.220
TODAY I WAS OVER AT-

08:26.288 --> 08:27.888
TIME'S UP!

08:27.956 --> 08:29.323
MARVELOUS GAG,
ISN'T IT?

08:29.391 --> 08:31.592
LEARNED THAT FROM
AN OLD ARMY BUDDY.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.645
ANYWAY...

08:35.714 --> 08:39.650
YOU KNOW DEACON AND KELLY HAVE BEEN
SEPARATED FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW, RIGHT?

08:39.717 --> 08:41.552
WELL, KELLY'S FINALLY READY
TO GET BACK TOGETHER,

08:41.620 --> 08:42.753
BUT DEACON
DOESN'T KNOW THAT YET.

08:42.821 --> 08:45.022
AND I WENT OVER THERE TODAY
TO TELL HIM THAT,

08:45.090 --> 08:46.841
BUT... I DIDN'T.

08:46.908 --> 08:48.743
WHY NOT?

08:48.810 --> 08:50.277
WELL...

08:50.345 --> 08:51.378
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO CARRIE,

08:51.446 --> 08:52.913
BUT IT TURNS OUT DEACON
MET THIS STEWARDESS

08:52.981 --> 08:54.682
WHO'S LEAVING THE COUNTRY
FOR GOOD TOMORROW,

08:54.750 --> 08:57.919
AND HE'S GOT A CHANCE
TO, YOU KNOW,

08:57.986 --> 09:00.588
BE WITH HER TONIGHT.

09:00.656 --> 09:05.677
SUDDENLY THIS STORY TURNS
EROTIC AND FASCINATING.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.781
SO I FIGURED AFTER
ALL HE'S BEEN THROUGH,

09:09.848 --> 09:10.982
HE DESERVES
A NIGHT LIKE THAT.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.084
BUT IF I TELL HIM
ABOUT KELLY COMING BACK,

09:13.151 --> 09:14.819
HE'S GONNA FEEL TOO GUILTY
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.153
SO I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

09:16.221 --> 09:17.722
BUT NOW I'M JUST STRUGGLING
WITH WHETHER OR NOT

09:17.790 --> 09:18.890
I MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

09:18.958 --> 09:19.957
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:22.361 --> 09:26.047
THE GIRL'S
A STEWARDESS, YOU SAY?

09:26.115 --> 09:28.182
YES, AND SMOKING HOT.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.117
AREN'T THEY ALL?

09:30.185 --> 09:32.803
NOT REALLY, NO.

09:32.871 --> 09:34.705
WELL, FRET NOT,
MY BOY.

09:34.773 --> 09:37.208
YOUR INSTINCTS WERE
RIGHT ON THE MONEY.

09:37.275 --> 09:38.876
YOU THINK SO?
ABSOLUTELY.

09:38.944 --> 09:40.044
IF DEACON
IS IN THE DARK

09:40.112 --> 09:42.279
ABOUT HIS WIFE'S
DESIRE TO RECONCILE,

09:42.347 --> 09:44.348
THERE ARE NO MORAL
CHAINS AROUND HIM.

09:44.415 --> 09:45.415
HE'S FREE TO FROLIC

09:45.483 --> 09:47.484
WITH A SENSUOUS
STRANGER TONIGHT

09:47.552 --> 09:49.519
AND REKINDLE

09:49.587 --> 09:51.255
THE FLAMES OF
MATRIMONY TOMORROW.

09:51.322 --> 09:53.023
AS LONG AS HE
CHANGES HIS SHEETS,

09:53.091 --> 09:55.993
IT'S A FAIRY TALE
ENDING!

09:56.061 --> 09:57.328
THANKS, ARTHUR.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.896
THAT REALLY MAKES ME
FEEL A LOT BETTER.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.564
THAT'S WHAT I DO!

10:07.489 --> 10:08.423
HELLO, DARLING.

10:08.490 --> 10:09.424
HI, DADDY.

10:09.491 --> 10:10.958
OOH, A PINK BOX.

10:11.026 --> 10:14.362
ARE WE BEING TREATED TO
SOME DELICIOUS BAKED GOODS?

10:14.430 --> 10:16.864
NO. SORRY. IT'S A CAKE
FOR DEACON AND KELLY.

10:16.932 --> 10:18.466
I WANTED TO GET THEM
A LITTLE SOMETHING

10:18.534 --> 10:19.733
FOR GETTING
BACK TOGETHER.

10:19.801 --> 10:21.369
HAD THEM SPELL OUT
"TRUE LOVE"

10:21.437 --> 10:22.903
IN THOSE LITTLE
CANDY HEARTS.

10:22.971 --> 10:24.138
KIND OF SILLY, EH?

10:27.810 --> 10:30.945
OH, GOD!
I'M A MONSTER!

10:32.931 --> 10:34.332
HUH?

10:34.399 --> 10:35.966
I'M AN ACCOMPLICE
TO SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

10:36.034 --> 10:38.101
I SHOULD JUST PAINT
A SCARLET "A" ON MYSELF.

10:38.169 --> 10:39.970
"A" FOR ADULTERY!

10:41.773 --> 10:44.041
THEN AFTER
THIS INCIDENT PASSES,

10:44.108 --> 10:46.811
I SUPPOSE IT COULD
STAND FOR ARTHUR.

10:46.878 --> 10:49.112
THAT WORKED OUT WELL.

11:01.643 --> 11:02.576
HI, HONEY.

11:02.644 --> 11:04.161
HI.

11:04.229 --> 11:05.512
WHATCHA DOING?

11:05.580 --> 11:07.748
JUST WATCHING
THE MET GAME.

11:07.816 --> 11:09.316
OH. CAN I
GET YOU ANYTHING?

11:09.384 --> 11:11.452
COFFEE, TEA,

11:11.519 --> 11:14.122
MAYBE A COMPLIMENTARY
HEADSET?

11:20.112 --> 11:21.546
UH-OH.

11:21.613 --> 11:22.547
YEAH.

11:22.614 --> 11:24.849
I HEARD ABOUT
THE STEWARDESS,

11:24.917 --> 11:26.233
AND YOU'RE GONNA
WISH YOUR EXITS

11:26.301 --> 11:28.602
WERE HERE AND HERE,

11:28.670 --> 11:31.405
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.107
THAT'S FUNNY.

11:33.175 --> 11:34.442
OW! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

11:34.509 --> 11:36.844
ARTHUR!

11:36.911 --> 11:39.847
OH, DON'T BLAME HIM.
THIS ISN'T HIS FAULT.

11:39.914 --> 11:40.848
WHY DID HE
EVEN TELL YOU?

11:40.915 --> 11:42.450
AN HOUR AGO,
HE AGREED WITH ME.

11:42.517 --> 11:43.750
BECAUSE, AS YOU
POINTED OUT MANY TIMES,

11:43.818 --> 11:45.353
HE'S INSANE.

11:45.420 --> 11:48.622
BUT AT LEAST HE HAS A SHRED
OF DECENCY IN HIM, UNLIKE YOU.

11:48.690 --> 11:49.790
WILL YOU
LET ME EXPLAIN?

11:49.858 --> 11:51.792
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW YOU CASUALLY DECIDED

11:51.860 --> 11:54.695
TO HELP YOUR BEST FRIEND
CHEAT ON HIS WIFE.

11:54.762 --> 11:55.829
FIRST OF ALL,
IT WASN'T CASUAL.

11:55.897 --> 11:57.698
IT WAS A VERY
DIFFICULT DECISION.

11:57.765 --> 11:59.083
OH, I'M GLAD
YOU CHEWED ON IT

11:59.150 --> 12:01.586
BEFORE YOU CAME DOWN
ON THE SIDE OF ADULTERY.

12:01.653 --> 12:02.687
SECOND OF ALL,
IT'S NOT ADULTERY,

12:02.754 --> 12:04.671
BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT BACK TOGETHER.

12:04.739 --> 12:06.590
SHE'S COMING BACK.
HE WANTS HER BACK.

12:06.658 --> 12:09.293
SO BASICALLY,
THEY ARE BACK TOGETHER.

12:09.361 --> 12:10.594
BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY BACK TOGETHER

12:10.662 --> 12:12.463
UNTIL DEACON KNOWS
THEY'RE BACK TOGETHER,

12:12.531 --> 12:15.032
WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO
HAPPEN SUNDAY NIGHT.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.200
JUST BECAUSE WE
FOUND OUT IN ADVANCE

12:16.268 --> 12:17.301
DOESN'T GIVE US
THE RIGHT

12:17.369 --> 12:18.869
TO TRAVEL
BACK IN TIME

12:18.937 --> 12:20.204
AND CHANGE
THEIR DESTINY.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.739
CARRIE, YOU DON'T MESS
WITH THE FABRIC OF TIME.

12:22.807 --> 12:25.309
<i>IF THERE'S ONE THING WE
LEARNED IN BACK TO THE FUTURE,</i>

12:25.377 --> 12:27.194
IT'S THAT.

12:29.648 --> 12:32.449
THIS IS
YOUR EXPLANATION?!

12:32.517 --> 12:33.484
YOU RANG, DOUGLAS?

12:33.551 --> 12:34.685
NOTHING. FORGET IT.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.786
WHILE I'M UP HERE,

12:35.854 --> 12:37.187
MAYBE WE CAN PUT
OUR HEADS TOGETHER

12:37.255 --> 12:38.389
AND FINISH UP
THIS CROSSWORD.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.890
GET OUT!

12:42.060 --> 12:43.660
WHO ARE YOU
CALLING?

12:43.728 --> 12:44.962
I'M NOT
CALLING ANYBODY.

12:45.029 --> 12:46.130
YOU'RE CALLING DEACON

12:46.198 --> 12:47.331
TO STOP
THIS UNHOLY THING

12:47.399 --> 12:48.832
BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.468
HE'S NOT HOME.
THEY'RE AT THE MET GAME.

12:50.535 --> 12:52.703
OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU
WERE WATCHING THE MET GAME,

12:52.770 --> 12:55.139
TO SPY ON YOUR HANDIWORK.

12:55.207 --> 12:56.574
YOU GOT IT. YEAH.
IT'S A DEEP FLY BALL,

12:56.641 --> 12:58.592
WAY BACK, SAILING
HIGH OVER THE COUPLE

12:58.660 --> 13:00.427
HUMPING
IN THE BLEACHERS.

13:00.495 --> 13:04.182
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE GOING
OVER THERE AFTER THE GAME.

13:04.249 --> 13:05.917
NO, I AM NOT.

13:05.984 --> 13:07.384
DOUG, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU.

13:07.452 --> 13:08.619
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

13:08.687 --> 13:10.321
YOU COULD BE DESTROYING
A MARRIAGE HERE.

13:10.388 --> 13:11.588
IT'S NOT GONNA
HURT THE MARRIAGE.

13:11.656 --> 13:13.825
SHE'S LEAVING THE
COUNTRY FOR GOOD TOMORROW.

13:13.892 --> 13:14.775
SHE'LL BE
OUT OF DEACON'S LIFE

13:14.843 --> 13:16.444
BEFORE KELLY
WALKS BACK IN.

13:16.511 --> 13:18.679
WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME-

13:18.747 --> 13:19.747
WILL YOU STOP
WITH THAT ALREADY?

13:19.815 --> 13:22.249
THERE'S NO TIME TRAVEL
INVOLVED HERE, OK?

13:22.317 --> 13:23.584
JUST HAVE
THE GUTS TO ADMIT

13:23.651 --> 13:25.986
THAT THIS IS ABOUT YOU
WANTING YOUR BEST FRIEND

13:26.054 --> 13:27.621
TO BANG A STEWARDESS.

13:27.689 --> 13:30.124
FINE. I ADMIT IT.

13:30.192 --> 13:31.726
AFTER WHAT KELLY'S
PUT HIM THROUGH,

13:31.793 --> 13:33.527
I THINK HE DESERVES
THIS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:33.595 --> 13:36.063
LETTING IT HAPPEN
IS MY GIFT TO HIM.

13:36.131 --> 13:37.181
THIS IS YOUR IDEA
OF A GIFT?

13:37.248 --> 13:38.849
YEAH. A GIFT
TO CELEBRATE THE END

13:38.917 --> 13:40.217
OF A HORRIBLE 2 YEARS.

13:40.285 --> 13:43.871
DID YOU GET HIM
A GIFT? NO.

13:43.939 --> 13:46.239
OK, SO DEACON
GETTING HIS WIFE BACK,

13:46.307 --> 13:47.240
HIS KIDS,

13:47.308 --> 13:48.442
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
OF A GIFT.

13:48.509 --> 13:50.510
HE NEEDS MORE
OF A GIFT THAN THAT.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.845
THEY'RE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF GIFTS.

13:51.913 --> 13:53.397
THAT'S WHY YOU GET MORE
THAN ONE GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.698
FOR GOD'S SAKE, CARRIE,
JEWISH PEOPLE

13:54.765 --> 13:56.766
GIVE 8 GIFTS
FOR HANUKKAH.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.685
OH, OK. SO ACCORDING
TO YOUR LOGIC,

13:58.753 --> 14:00.487
WOULD IT BE OK
IF DEACON SLEPT

14:00.555 --> 14:03.157
WITH 7 OTHER WOMEN
TONIGHT?

14:03.224 --> 14:06.694
NO, 'CAUSE
HE'S NOT JEWISH.

14:06.761 --> 14:09.530
THE STUPIDEST
CONVERSATION

14:09.597 --> 14:11.048
I'VE EVER HAD.

14:11.115 --> 14:12.683
NO. THE STUPIDEST
CONVERSATION I'VE EVER HAD,

14:12.751 --> 14:14.918
AND BESIDES, KELLY'S
BEEN WITH A MILLION GUYS

14:14.986 --> 14:16.420
SINCE SHE LEFT HIM.

14:16.487 --> 14:18.572
EXCUSE ME. SHE'S BEEN
WITH EXACTLY 2 GUYS,

14:18.640 --> 14:20.308
AND SHE ONLY SLEPT
WITH ONE OF THEM.

14:20.375 --> 14:22.209
HE WAS AN ORTHODONTIST.

14:22.277 --> 14:25.029
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

14:25.097 --> 14:27.114
JUST THAT SHE REGRETTED
IT. IT WAS WEIRD.

14:27.182 --> 14:28.915
THE GUY CRIED OR
SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

14:28.983 --> 14:30.767
THE POINT IS THAT
WHEN THAT HAPPENED,

14:30.835 --> 14:32.869
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
WAS GONNA HAPPEN

14:32.937 --> 14:34.321
WITH HER
AND DEACON, OK?

14:34.388 --> 14:36.824
TODAY IS THE DAY BEFORE
THEY'RE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

14:36.891 --> 14:38.742
SO IF THE SEX
GOES PAST MIDNIGHT,

14:38.809 --> 14:40.810
IT'LL BE
THE SAME DAY.

14:40.878 --> 14:43.130
THE SEX PROBABLY
WON'T GO PAST MIDNIGHT.

14:43.198 --> 14:44.231
DON'T BE SO SURE.

14:44.299 --> 14:45.466
SOME PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY PULL THAT OFF.

14:45.534 --> 14:47.935
OH, I SEE ALL THE GUNS
ARE OUT NOW!

14:48.002 --> 14:50.237
YOU CAN INSULT ME
ALL YOU WANT.

14:50.305 --> 14:52.039
I'M STILL NOT GOING OVER
THERE AND TELLING HIM.

14:52.106 --> 14:54.274
I'M JUST NOT.

14:54.343 --> 14:55.492
ALL RIGHT.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.528
LOOK, DOUG, OK.

14:57.595 --> 15:00.697
I ADMIT THAT DEACON BEING
WITH THIS GIRL TONIGHT

15:00.765 --> 15:02.632
PROBABLY WON'T DESTROY THEIR MARRIAGE,

15:02.700 --> 15:04.068
AND, YES,
MAYBE IN SOME WAY,

15:04.135 --> 15:06.603
HE PROBABLY
DOES DESERVE IT.

15:06.671 --> 15:08.338
BUT I JUST FEEL

15:08.406 --> 15:10.691
LIKE NOT TELLING
DEACON ABOUT KELLY

15:10.758 --> 15:12.193
IS JUST WRONG.

15:12.260 --> 15:13.961
HONEY, IT'S WRONG,

15:14.029 --> 15:15.312
AND I KNOW
IN YOUR HEART

15:15.380 --> 15:16.880
YOU KNOW THAT, TOO.

15:19.334 --> 15:20.734
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

15:20.802 --> 15:21.735
COME ON, HONEY.

15:21.803 --> 15:24.271
AFTER THE GAME,
WE'LL GO OVER THERE,

15:24.339 --> 15:27.475
AND WE'LL TELL HIM,
ALL RIGHT?

15:29.644 --> 15:30.677
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

15:30.745 --> 15:33.314
OK, GOOD. I'LL
BET HE THANKS YOU.

15:33.382 --> 15:35.967
OH, YEAH. I EXPECT TO GET
A VERY HEARTY HANDSHAKE.

15:36.034 --> 15:37.068
WHEN'S
THE GAME OVER?

15:37.135 --> 15:39.370
I DON'T KNOW. A COUPLE HOURS AT LEAST.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.738
DOUG?

15:40.806 --> 15:42.306
WHAT?

15:42.373 --> 15:43.974
IT'S RAINING.

15:44.042 --> 15:45.008
SO?

15:45.076 --> 15:48.178
IT'S RAINING!

15:48.246 --> 15:51.415
THERE'S AN ABBOTT
AND COSTELLO MOVIE ON.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.017
"DUE TO TODAY'S RAIN,

15:54.085 --> 15:56.186
THE GAME WILL BE COMPLETED
TOMORROW AS A DOUBLEHEADER."

15:56.254 --> 15:58.305
OH, MY GOD! THEY'RE PROBABLY
AT HIS APARTMENT RIGHT NOW.

15:58.373 --> 16:00.040
SHE'S PROBABLY UNPINNING
HER LITTLE WINGS

16:00.108 --> 16:01.542
AS WE SPEAK.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.181
HE DOESN'T EVEN REALIZE THE
MUMMY'S RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

16:07.249 --> 16:08.181
DOUG!

16:14.556 --> 16:15.856
I HOPE WE'RE
NOT TOO LATE.

16:15.923 --> 16:19.026
YEAH, ME, TOO.

16:22.197 --> 16:24.397
CAN YOU HEAR THE
DOORBELL FROM THE BEDROOM?

16:24.465 --> 16:27.668
I DON'T KNOW.

16:27.735 --> 16:29.119
WELL,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:29.187 --> 16:30.621
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE

16:30.689 --> 16:33.089
SINCE WE HAD
A SLUMBER PARTY.

16:33.157 --> 16:34.641
ALL RIGHT,
JUST USE YOUR KEY.

16:34.709 --> 16:35.809
I DON'T HAVE A KEY.

16:35.877 --> 16:37.111
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

16:37.179 --> 16:38.946
I KNOW YOU GUYS
SWAPPED HOUSE KEYS,

16:39.013 --> 16:40.748
LIKE, 5 YEARS AGO.

16:40.816 --> 16:42.333
OH, RIGHT.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.069
MY "PLEASE BURST IN IF I'M
EVER NAILING A STEWARDESS" KEY.

16:45.136 --> 16:46.070
RIGHT.

16:46.137 --> 16:47.604
JUST OPEN IT.

16:55.780 --> 16:57.815
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE HERE.

16:57.882 --> 16:59.083
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
IN THE BEDROOM,

16:59.150 --> 17:01.585
YOU KNOW, DOING IT?

17:01.652 --> 17:03.554
HOW THE HELL
SHOULD I KNOW?

17:03.721 --> 17:05.306
CHECK IT OUT!

17:11.061 --> 17:12.128
DOUG.

17:14.115 --> 17:16.534
HELLO?

17:16.601 --> 17:17.768
DEAC?

17:17.835 --> 17:20.387
HOT STEWARDESS?

17:20.454 --> 17:21.789
HA HA HA!
I'M SORRY.

17:21.856 --> 17:23.523
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYONE RUN SO FAST

17:23.590 --> 17:24.692
FROM A LITTLE RAIN.

17:24.759 --> 17:28.429
THIS SHIRT IS SUEDE.
IT'S $60, BABY.

17:28.496 --> 17:31.031
ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT SORRY

17:31.098 --> 17:33.166
THE GAME
GOT RAINED OUT.

17:33.234 --> 17:35.602
GIVES US MORE TIME
FOR DINNER

17:35.670 --> 17:37.588
AND WHATNOT.

17:37.655 --> 17:39.406
I LIKE THE SOUND
OF WHATNOT.

17:39.474 --> 17:41.975
HA HA HA.

17:42.043 --> 17:43.444
HOW'S IT GOING?

17:48.783 --> 17:50.634
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

17:50.702 --> 17:52.653
I HEARD THAT THE MET
GAME GOT RAINED OUT,

17:52.721 --> 17:54.188
SO I CAME OVER HERE

17:54.255 --> 17:57.424
TO CLOSE YOUR WINDOWS.

17:57.442 --> 18:00.694
OK, ONCE AGAIN, WHAT
WERE YOU DOING IN THERE?

18:00.762 --> 18:05.449
ACTUALLY, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU A SECOND ALONE.

18:05.516 --> 18:07.268
WHY DON'T I
JUST WAIT INSIDE?

18:07.335 --> 18:08.802
THANKS.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.771
DON'T BE SCARED.

18:10.838 --> 18:12.273
THE WHITE WOMAN COMING
OUT OF THE BATHROOM

18:12.340 --> 18:13.740
WILL BE MY WIFE.

18:13.808 --> 18:14.741
RIGHT.

18:14.809 --> 18:15.742
OK.

18:18.313 --> 18:21.081
HI. I'M MELANIE.

18:21.149 --> 18:22.949
WOW.

18:24.386 --> 18:25.486
SO THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT.

18:25.554 --> 18:26.753
KELLY'S COMING BACK
TOMORROW.

18:26.821 --> 18:30.257
SHE LOVES YOU, AND SHE
WANTS TO STAY MARRIED.

18:30.325 --> 18:32.826
YEAH, THAT'S IT. THAT'S
THE WHOLE DEAL RIGHT THERE.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.428
GREAT NEWS,
HUH, DEAC?

18:36.314 --> 18:37.848
DEAC, YOU THERE,
BUDDY?

18:42.420 --> 18:45.472
I LOVE MY WIFE.

18:45.539 --> 18:47.090
THE FACT THAT
SHE'S COMING BACK

18:47.158 --> 18:48.192
IS THE BEST NEWS

18:48.259 --> 18:51.445
I COULD
EVER HOPE TO GET.

18:51.512 --> 18:53.113
THAT BEING SAID,

18:53.180 --> 18:54.648
YOU REALIZE
YOU TOLD ME

18:54.716 --> 18:58.218
AT THE WORST
POSSIBLE TIME,

18:58.286 --> 18:59.336
DON'T YOU?

18:59.403 --> 19:00.671
YES. YES, I DO.

19:00.838 --> 19:01.988
THEN WHY THE HELL
DID YOU TELL ME NOW?!

19:02.056 --> 19:03.707
I'M SORRY. CARRIE MADE ME.

19:03.775 --> 19:04.792
THE ONLY WORSE TIME
YOU COULD'VE PICKED

19:04.859 --> 19:05.793
IS IF YOU WAITED
ANOTHER HALF HOUR

19:05.860 --> 19:07.494
AND POPPED OUT FROM
UNDER THE COVERS.

19:07.562 --> 19:08.796
I FOUGHT FOR YOU!

19:08.863 --> 19:09.863
I FOUGHT FOR YOU,

19:09.931 --> 19:11.198
AND I TOLD HER
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL

19:11.266 --> 19:13.200
AND YOU DESERVE THIS,

19:13.268 --> 19:14.468
AND THEN
SHE SAID SOME STUFF,

19:14.536 --> 19:15.469
AND HERE WE ARE.

19:15.537 --> 19:17.237
OH, MAN.

19:17.305 --> 19:18.939
SO WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

19:19.007 --> 19:20.307
I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T
EVEN THINK STRAIGHT.

19:20.374 --> 19:21.809
IN MY MIND,
I'M SEEING MY FAMILY

19:21.876 --> 19:23.310
ALL BACK TOGETHER
FOR CHRISTMAS,

19:23.377 --> 19:24.294
EXCEPT
INSTEAD OF A TREE,

19:24.412 --> 19:26.980
WE'RE DECORATING
A NAKED STEWARDESS.

19:27.048 --> 19:30.266
DEAC, THAT IS
A MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

19:33.938 --> 19:35.723
HEY.

19:35.790 --> 19:37.758
DID YOU GUYS
HAVE YOUR TALK?

19:37.826 --> 19:39.076
YEAH.

19:39.144 --> 19:40.727
OH.

19:40.795 --> 19:42.479
OH, WHAT?

19:42.547 --> 19:44.398
NOTHING. I WAS JUST
IN THERE WITH MELANIE,

19:44.466 --> 19:46.249
AND, UH,
SHE AIN'T UGLY,

19:46.317 --> 19:49.369
THAT'S
FOR DARN TOOTIN'.

19:49.471 --> 19:50.670
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I
SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HIM?

19:50.738 --> 19:51.871
NO, NO. YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.091
DEFINITELY. YOU DEFINITELY
DID THE RIGHT THING,

19:54.158 --> 19:57.327
ALTHOUGH SHE
COULD NOT BE NICER.

19:57.395 --> 19:59.913
SHE ACTUALLY GAVE ME SOME
FREE COUPONS FOR AN UPGRADE.

19:59.980 --> 20:01.348
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE DOING TO ME?

20:01.416 --> 20:02.683
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE
HELL ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?!

20:02.751 --> 20:04.685
NOTHING,
NOTHING, NOTHING.

20:04.753 --> 20:05.903
I'M JUST THINKING.

20:05.970 --> 20:08.288
THEY STILL ARE
TECHNICALLY SEPARATED,

20:08.356 --> 20:09.456
AND KELLY
DID HAVE HER THING

20:09.524 --> 20:10.857
WITH
THE ORTHODONTIST.

20:10.925 --> 20:12.543
SHE SLEPT
WITH DR. GOTTLEIB?!

20:12.610 --> 20:15.245
KIND OF. IT WAS
NOT A BIG DEAL.

20:15.313 --> 20:16.829
LISTEN, DEACON,
YOU'RE AN ADULT.

20:16.864 --> 20:18.131
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF MAKING
YOUR OWN DECISIONS.

20:18.199 --> 20:19.132
WE SHOULD
HAVE NEVER INTERFERED.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.434
JUST DO
WHAT FEELS RIGHT, OK?

20:20.502 --> 20:21.868
COME ON, BABE.

20:23.338 --> 20:26.022
WE WERE NEVER HERE.

20:26.090 --> 20:28.959
THE LAST 5 MINUTES
NEVER HAPPENED.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.543
YOU'RE JUST GETTING BACK
FROM THE MET GAME.

20:30.611 --> 20:32.295
THE METS WON.

20:32.347 --> 20:33.363
YOU'VE GOT
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

20:33.431 --> 20:35.516
IN YOUR APARTMENT
WAITING FOR YOU.

20:35.583 --> 20:36.800
AND GO.

20:51.816 --> 20:54.317
OH, ARE THESE
YOUR KIDS?

20:54.385 --> 20:56.753
THEY'RE ADORABLE.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.424
AW, CRAP.

21:07.699 --> 21:08.549
YOU KNOW, DEACON,

21:08.616 --> 21:09.900
I ACTUALLY THINK
THIS TIME APART

21:09.968 --> 21:11.468
WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE
THING FOR US,

21:11.535 --> 21:12.602
DON'T YOU?

21:12.670 --> 21:13.737
WE BOTH GOT OUT THERE

21:13.805 --> 21:15.405
AND GOT
TO LIVE A LITTLE.

21:15.473 --> 21:16.873
I HAD MY EXPERIENCES,

21:16.941 --> 21:18.592
YOU HAD YOURS.

21:20.227 --> 21:21.428
BY THE WAY,
CAN YOU TAKE KIRBY

21:21.495 --> 21:22.930
TO HIS APPOINTMENT
AT DR. GOTTLEIB'S

21:22.997 --> 21:24.731
ON THURSDAY?

21:29.136 --> 21:31.254
WE'RE GONNA
NEED A NEW MIRROR.
