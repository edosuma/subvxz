MUSIC: Flagpole Sitta by Harvey Danger

00:02.722 --> 00:06.158
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.202 --> 00:09.194
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.241 --> 00:13.757
<i>Cos I'm in hell</i>

00:19.160 --> 00:23.710
So, stop all the clocks,
Toni and Tony are getting remarried!

00:23.759 --> 00:28.913
Sure, we made mistakes first time,
but now we've got the chance

00:28.959 --> 00:31.267
to make them all over again!

00:31.318 --> 00:36.266
Already with the jokes. At least one of us
is serious about giving us a fucking go!

00:38.677 --> 00:40.907
So long, Toni.

00:40.957 --> 00:41.912
You did, didn't you?

00:41.957 --> 00:45.187
<i>Oh, yeah. And you did, obviously.</i>

00:45.236 --> 00:47.352
Ooh, yeah. Spicy!

00:47.396 --> 00:50.353
Clinical, more like. What's that?

00:50.395 --> 00:51.953
A bit of crack.

00:51.995 --> 00:54.748
Crack? Crack, Super Hans?

00:54.795 --> 00:59.026
Relax, it's not Blue Peter.
Just a nice relaxing smoke of crack.

00:59.074 --> 01:02.349
Oh, my Lord! Oh, my fucking life. It isn't?

01:02.393 --> 01:05.032
It bloody is! Gog!

01:06.033 --> 01:06.943
Gog?

01:06.993 --> 01:11.270
Gog.
At school, you'd run up and sneeze in his face.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.824
Gog!

01:14.872 --> 01:16.782
Jeremy. What are you doing here?

01:16.831 --> 01:20.506
Wouldn't you like to know, you big prick!
So what are you doing?

01:20.551 --> 01:24.338
Just running the business -
hiring, firing and perspiring!

01:24.390 --> 01:30.180
Business Look at you, with your wine
and your jacket, just like a real person!

01:30.229 --> 01:33.460
Remember when we made you
wank off Perchy's dog for a fiver?

01:33.509 --> 01:35.305
What are you doing, really?

01:35.348 --> 01:37.703
Like I said, business. Going public in April.

01:37.748 --> 01:41.582
User names.
And overseeing the edit on my first short...

01:41.628 --> 01:43.857
Honda are very interested.

01:43.907 --> 01:46.865
What, so you're actually successful?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.942
Looks like it, yeah.

01:48.986 --> 01:53.662
Just been looking for music for our soundtrack
that doesn't suck arse.

01:53.706 --> 01:56.777
But, Gog, I'm music! I make music!

01:56.825 --> 02:00.295
Right. Well, maybe we should meet up,
have a chat.

02:00.345 --> 02:03.700
Of course we should meet up and have a chat.
Look, here's Super Hans.

02:03.744 --> 02:05.621
We can do the music, can't we, Super Hans?

02:05.664 --> 02:08.461
Tell you what, that crack is really moreish!

02:10.583 --> 02:14.939
'Saturday shift! I thought
we had people in Ireland to do this for us.

02:14.982 --> 02:16.734
'Lovely trustworthy voices.'

02:16.782 --> 02:19.091
If I can call at a more convenient...

02:19.142 --> 02:20.097
OK, bye.

02:21.821 --> 02:25.496
'Mmm, Sophie, with her lovely soft face.

02:25.541 --> 02:30.091
'Jeff!
Can't believe they're doing the Stockport contract!

02:30.140 --> 02:34.099
'Perfect excuse for her to go round to his place,
and I'm stuck with the new guy.'

02:34.140 --> 02:36.607
- See you later, gays!
- What?!

02:36.659 --> 02:41.857
See you later, guys.
Soph, see you at my place. 33 Ringfield Road.

02:41.898 --> 02:44.014
You bring the vino.

02:44.058 --> 02:46.856
I've got the massage oil!

02:46.898 --> 02:50.776
'He hasn't got any massage oil.
He's trying to make me obsess about massage oil.

02:50.817 --> 02:52.614
'And it's worked.

02:52.657 --> 02:57.207
'Break with the newbie will be a pain fest,
trying to chat.

02:57.256 --> 03:00.566
'I'll say I'm very upset
and go and sit on the loo and never explain.'

03:00.616 --> 03:01.934
Huh?

03:01.975 --> 03:07.572
'Oh, God, he's taunting me!
I should've made him a cup of tea when I had one.

03:07.615 --> 03:10.845
'Hurrah! It was a joke! Hilarious! '

03:12.814 --> 03:17.329
Sure you don't need a loan? Maybe
for some therapy to help you shpeak pwoperly.

03:17.373 --> 03:19.967
Huh? OK, bye.

03:21.772 --> 03:22.807
He'd already hung up.

03:22.852 --> 03:25.127
Oh! Right!

03:25.172 --> 03:29.005
I don't know about you,
but I'm so bored I could eat a fucking stapler!

03:29.051 --> 03:33.044
'This is crazy.
I should be working, but I'm not.'

03:33.091 --> 03:37.242
- Ha-ha! I see you!
- I'm Barnes Wallis, you're the Ruhr!

03:37.290 --> 03:40.726
'I'm the Ruhr and no-one's
actually said the word "Dambusters"!

03:40.770 --> 03:43.158
'This is bloody brilliant! I'm having fun!

03:43.209 --> 03:46.167
'And I'm not thinking about Sophie! '

03:46.209 --> 03:47.880
- Go on.
- I can't!

03:47.928 --> 03:50.920
- Just imagine it's lan's cock.
- Ha-ha-ha!

03:54.447 --> 03:57.007
'I've got a friend! I've made a friend!

03:57.047 --> 04:01.005
'Maybe there's nothing wrong with me
and I'm just a normal human being! '

04:06.246 --> 04:08.236
'I can't believe I'm pitching to Gog.

04:08.285 --> 04:11.721
'I hope he doesn't know it was me
who did the shit in his mum's airing cupboard.

04:11.765 --> 04:14.517
'Please like my music, you lanky wanker! '

04:14.564 --> 04:18.557
'Please, please let me do the music
for your Honda film! '

04:23.723 --> 04:26.795
- Want another beer?
- Sure.

04:26.843 --> 04:29.959
- Follow me.
- 'He hates is. He bloody hates it.'

04:30.002 --> 04:35.758
These are my guys. They had to pull a latey, so I
invited them round. I've got a fridge full of beers.

04:35.801 --> 04:39.510
This way I get to keep an eye on, which is cool!

04:39.561 --> 04:42.199
Very cool. So, about the track...

04:42.240 --> 04:46.950
You know what I fancy? A kebab.
Will you go down and get me a kebab?

04:48.599 --> 04:52.194
- You want me to...
- I want a kebab.

04:52.239 --> 04:54.035
What, really?

04:54.078 --> 04:57.593
No! Why, were you going to go and get me one?

04:57.638 --> 05:01.425
- No!
- I can't believe you were going to get me one!

05:01.477 --> 05:03.911
- I wasn't!
- Well, I want one now.

05:04.717 --> 05:05.911
Right...

05:07.036 --> 05:08.105
Really?

05:08.156 --> 05:11.228
No! I'm shitting you, Jez!

05:11.276 --> 05:12.425
Jesus!

05:12.476 --> 05:15.751
So, about the soundtrack. Can I do it?

05:15.795 --> 05:21.152
I'm talking to a number of people, Jez.
What I want is something classic.

05:21.194 --> 05:23.788
Remember the theme tune from Jaws?

05:23.834 --> 05:27.667
Well, I don't want that, obviously,
I want something completely different.

05:27.713 --> 05:31.911
I want something that, when people hear it,
they'll immediately go, "Yeah."

05:33.113 --> 05:34.704
Right.

05:34.752 --> 05:40.462
'What shall I write?
Can't just put "Not Jaws". Do pretend writing.'

05:42.111 --> 05:45.421
- Are you pretending to write?
- No...

05:47.950 --> 05:51.625
It's... Really, I honestly didn't see anyone.

05:51.670 --> 05:54.502
'Shit, what if they bring in forensics? '

05:54.549 --> 05:59.543
Oh, hell, I probably shouldn't have done that,
should I? My prints'll be all over it now.

05:59.589 --> 06:05.345
Yeah, well, it's embarrassing.
And since lan Krauss is of German extraction,

06:05.388 --> 06:07.184
it has to be treated as a racial incident.

06:07.227 --> 06:10.378
Ian's a? A racial incident?

06:10.427 --> 06:12.657
But... why?

06:12.707 --> 06:15.095
Oh, come on, Mark. Germans?

06:15.146 --> 06:17.660
Sausages?

06:17.706 --> 06:20.265
Do I have to spell it out?

06:24.625 --> 06:27.013
Of course. Horrible.

06:28.344 --> 06:34.293
And they're treating it as a racial incident?
Next you won't be able to get a black coffee!

06:34.343 --> 06:37.699
Exactly! And they'll have
a bloody EU banana-straightening machine

06:37.743 --> 06:39.858
to straighten all the bananas!

06:39.902 --> 06:43.941
There's already a banana-straightening machine.
It's called woman.

06:43.982 --> 06:47.212
Take that Sophie,
going over to Jeff's like that right in your face.

06:47.261 --> 06:50.094
That is the behaviour of a world-class bitch.

06:50.141 --> 06:51.574
Yeah!

06:51.621 --> 06:54.817
'Go on, say it. I'm gonna say it! '

06:54.860 --> 06:57.658
Yeah, I suppose she is a bit of a... bitch.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.736
Too right. Ask Clarkson. Clarkson knows.

07:00.779 --> 07:03.532
'Good old Clarkson! '

07:03.579 --> 07:06.888
People like fast cars, females with big boobies
and they don't want the euro.

07:06.938 --> 07:09.008
That's all there is to it.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.733
I'm not that hungry. Do you want anything?

07:11.778 --> 07:13.893
Don't fancy a Chinky. Have you got a pizza menu?

07:13.937 --> 07:15.609
About a million!

07:18.657 --> 07:21.045
I'd like to see 'em run like that
carrying real Sten guns.

07:21.096 --> 07:26.613
- Yeah? Do you know about?
- Just re-enactments. It's cool, we do WW2 stuff.

07:26.655 --> 07:30.204
Can be an 'ell of a laugh, you know,
just guys together.

07:30.255 --> 07:31.404
Re-enactments?

07:31.455 --> 07:36.084
'They probably sound more fun
than they really are. Like Laser Quest.'

07:36.134 --> 07:37.249
Another beergee?

07:37.294 --> 07:38.613
Lock and load!

07:40.853 --> 07:43.367
'God, what is he taking?

07:43.413 --> 07:46.848
'Better not disturb him,
he might attack me and be sick. Eugh'

07:47.012 --> 07:49.082
Jeremy?

07:50.492 --> 07:51.322
What?

07:51.372 --> 07:53.362
What's Hans doing?

07:53.411 --> 07:54.810
He's honking on his crack pipe.

07:54.851 --> 07:57.490
Crack?! I've got company!

07:57.531 --> 08:03.685
Oh, relax! "Oh, I'm Mark, I'm in the '80s, I'm dying
of heroin in a puddle in the corner in an advert!"

08:03.730 --> 08:06.197
Drugs are fine, Mark, everyone agrees now.

08:06.249 --> 08:09.844
Drugs are what happen to people,
and that's fine, so shut up.

08:11.809 --> 08:13.685
Look, I don't want to make a scene...

08:13.728 --> 08:14.877
A- ha-ha-hah!

08:14.928 --> 08:15.804
What?

08:15.848 --> 08:17.327
It's Gog. I got the commission!

08:17.368 --> 08:18.562
Well, congratulations...

08:18.608 --> 08:21.360
<i>Shove it up your arsel Shove it up your arsel</i>

08:21.407 --> 08:26.116
I've got a commission! It's big and it's fat
and it's going right up your white-bread arse!

08:26.326 --> 08:28.362
Jez, for God's sake, I'm pleased for you!

08:28.406 --> 08:33.399
Sure you are So pleased that I've gone
straight to the finish line on my enormous bike

08:33.445 --> 08:37.323
while you're still jogging along for miles
in the rat race with all the other rats.

08:37.485 --> 08:39.042
Exactly. I think it's great.

08:39.083 --> 08:43.475
Great! So you won't mind if I take you out
for an incredibly expensive meal to celebrate.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.753
- I'm not that hungry.
- Bollocks. We're going.

08:48.923 --> 08:53.552
Why did you have to bring Daryl?
He's a bit... boring, isn't he?

08:53.602 --> 08:57.151
Boring?
What, cos he doesn't go around with... a haircut

08:57.202 --> 09:02.036
and an iPod and... piercings and a... strap-on?

09:02.081 --> 09:02.911
Strap-on?

09:02.961 --> 09:04.360
It's an example.

09:04.401 --> 09:10.555
Sorry, excuse me, I ordered
three pilau rice and three peshwari naans.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.275
It's all right, Jeremy, it's all right,
I changed the order. There's always rice left.

09:15.319 --> 09:20.711
<i>It's not all right. Bring us three pilau rice
and four peshwari naans, please.</i>

09:21.718 --> 09:25.995
I've shared enough rice with you, Mark.
I'm in the big league now.

09:26.037 --> 09:29.473
Four naan, Jeremy? Four? That's insane.

09:29.517 --> 09:33.031
So, what am I going to pay you to do
in my band?

09:33.076 --> 09:36.830
That's very kind, Jez,
but you don't want to overstretch yourself.

09:36.876 --> 09:42.233
Bollocks. I'm a very generous guy.
Daryl's bringing his cor anglais, Nancy's singing,

09:42.275 --> 09:44.505
what are you going to do?

09:44.555 --> 09:47.466
Well, we did once talk about me doing

09:47.514 --> 09:50.790
a kind of Jean-Michel Jarre thing on the
keyboards.

09:50.834 --> 09:56.305
Mm-hm. Or I was sort of hoping
you'd say you want to be the manager.

09:56.353 --> 10:01.824
You could order me around,
which you'd enjoy, but I'd be your boss.

10:01.872 --> 10:04.147
Could be kind of confusing, in a good way.

10:04.192 --> 10:08.469
Three more beers for the Three Musketeers, eh?
Ooh!

10:08.511 --> 10:11.786
Aaaaah!

10:11.830 --> 10:13.229
Aah...

10:13.270 --> 10:17.661
Ey, check this out, right?
Sexy girl walks past, it's like...

10:20.589 --> 10:24.547
That's not funny, Daryl. Repeat, not funny!

10:24.588 --> 10:29.343
Oh, come on, lads, let's lose the cone.
I'm a somebody now. There's no need for a cone.

10:29.388 --> 10:31.026
Ooh!

10:31.067 --> 10:37.063
Too good for the cone, are we?
We're having a laugh, Jeremy, a bloody good laugh!

10:37.107 --> 10:40.337
Bet we're having a much better time
than Sophie is right now.

10:40.386 --> 10:44.140
Ey! Course we are, mate, course we are!

10:44.186 --> 10:47.734
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you where we should go now.

10:48.825 --> 10:51.497
- What are we gonna do?
- Fuck him up!

10:51.544 --> 10:55.014
We should check the doorbell's working
nice and loud, yeah?

10:55.064 --> 10:59.818
Or... or we could make
a special delivery for Jeff Heaney.

10:59.863 --> 11:02.093
Daryl, what are you? No! Don't!

11:03.823 --> 11:05.096
Oh, fuck!

11:06.182 --> 11:08.252
Oh, piss.

11:09.862 --> 11:12.091
Oh, crumbs.

11:15.381 --> 11:20.773
'What am I gonna tell Gog?
What happened to all the time? We had loads! '

11:20.820 --> 11:25.210
What we need to do
is create a powerful sense of dread.

11:29.619 --> 11:32.337
See, the longer the note, the more dread.

11:32.378 --> 11:37.133
'God that's terrible.
It's worse than Daryl's bloody cor anglais.

11:37.178 --> 11:39.133
'They're useless. I wish they were all robots.

11:39.177 --> 11:42.374
'I wish I was a robot.
Maybe I could punch through a wall.'

11:42.417 --> 11:46.489
Yeah, OK. Right, ready? One, two, three, let's go!

11:47.416 --> 11:50.169
<i>Watch out, they're gonna get you</i>

11:50.216 --> 11:53.844
<i>They're gonna get you, baby
They're coming after you</i>

11:53.895 --> 11:56.932
<i>Watch your back, they're gonna get you</i>

11:56.975 --> 11:59.886
<i>They're comin' after you-ou...</i>

11:59.934 --> 12:01.970
Look, no, all right?

12:02.014 --> 12:05.369
That's... not shit, but just... no.

12:06.213 --> 12:09.569
Hans, you realise we've only got 39 minutes left.

12:09.613 --> 12:12.888
Oh, so now we're working
it's not OK for me to smoke my crack?

12:12.932 --> 12:14.843
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

12:14.892 --> 12:17.724
What, so next you're gonna boot me out
for not wearing a jacket and tie?

12:17.771 --> 12:24.005
- Jez, is there anything I can?
- It's under control. Please go behind the glass.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.529
But, as your manager...

12:25.570 --> 12:30.723
Just get back behind the glass.
There is a very clear, if invisible, line,

12:30.769 --> 12:34.921
here be beauty, there be... pie charts. OK?

12:34.969 --> 12:38.563
Look, I've been here since eight,
I'm just going to grab a coffee.

12:38.608 --> 12:42.726
Yeah, well, if you're leaving now,
don't even fucking dream of coming back!

12:46.127 --> 12:48.925
Oh, God!

12:48.967 --> 12:53.039
I mean, obviously, a band isn't an army,
but you need some organisation.

12:53.086 --> 12:55.156
Exactly my feeling. Exactly.

12:55.206 --> 13:00.040
Democracy's all very well, but it's weak
and it's decadent. You need a strong leader.

13:00.085 --> 13:01.279
Er...

13:01.325 --> 13:02.394
I'm in character.

13:02.445 --> 13:08.076
Oh! Er, yes, yes, right. Yes.
The Fatherland needs the Fuhrer.

13:08.124 --> 13:11.559
'Oh, God, I'm even boring when I'm a Nazi.'

13:11.603 --> 13:16.199
Jesus! Classic rubbernecker.
Absolutely no interest in military history.

13:16.243 --> 13:19.075
Might as well be checking out
fucking seed drills in a farm museum.

13:19.122 --> 13:22.398
Still, it's nice to get out of the city, isn't it?

13:22.442 --> 13:26.070
Oh, yes, it's nice to get away from it all,
the work, the smog, the graffiti.

13:26.121 --> 13:28.589
Yeah, the traffic, the noise, the hassle.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.394
Car alarms, the cashpoints,
the blacks, the Pakis, the Jews...

13:33.400 --> 13:38.234
Oh, er, yeah, yeah. I mean,
that's what we all want, a racially pure nation.

13:38.279 --> 13:41.874
Exactly.
All we're saying is England for the English, right?

13:41.919 --> 13:44.990
You mean... Germany for the Germans?

13:45.078 --> 13:48.275
You mean... This is... Are we?

13:48.318 --> 13:51.275
Rights for whites. That's not too much to ask, is it?

13:51.317 --> 13:54.115
Is this... real now?

13:54.157 --> 13:59.389
We're on the same wavelength. Everyone thinks it,
the difference is, we're not afraid to say it.

13:59.436 --> 14:04.555
'Oh, shit. Oh, bollocks.
Of course, I can't just make a nice, normal friend.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.631
'Oh, no, that would be far too simple'

14:06.675 --> 14:07.949
Heil Hitler!

14:07.995 --> 14:09.712
Er, heil.

14:09.754 --> 14:12.507
You're not supposed to do that, Daryl!

14:12.554 --> 14:14.465
You know you're not supposed to do that!

14:17.673 --> 14:23.224
I was really, really, really pleased with the track,
once we got that weird hiss off.

14:23.952 --> 14:27.501
I mean, you'll never get it off entirely,
but, you know.

14:27.552 --> 14:28.905
Uh-huh.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.387
'I've got to cut the link.
Daryl is definitely beyond.'

14:32.431 --> 14:36.742
So, rest of the money should be rolling in soon,
which is just as well!

14:36.790 --> 14:38.064
Uh-huh.

14:38.110 --> 14:43.581
'Or maybe I'm just overreacting.
Maybe everyone does it, and it's cool and Ali G

14:43.629 --> 14:45.938
'and I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud, as usual.'

14:45.989 --> 14:50.186
Mark, like I said, sorry
if I was a bit of a cock-muncher down the studio.

14:50.228 --> 14:53.538
Fine. It's totally fine, mate. Honestly.

14:55.388 --> 14:57.742
Listen, I might pop...

14:57.787 --> 15:01.496
just pop down the, er, Chinky.
Do you want anything?

15:01.547 --> 15:05.459
From... Er... no, I'm all right, thanks.

15:05.506 --> 15:09.703
What about from... the... Paki shop?
Do you want anything from in there?

15:09.745 --> 15:10.894
The "Paki shop"?

15:10.945 --> 15:15.620
Yeah, I don't normally go there.
They've always got that wog box on.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.222
Mark, what the hell are you talking about?

15:17.264 --> 15:20.654
Yeah. That's not on, is it?

15:20.704 --> 15:24.332
What I said, it's not all right, is it?

15:24.383 --> 15:26.180
Well, no.

15:26.223 --> 15:31.535
And obviously you don't think there's a...
global Jewish conspiracy

15:31.582 --> 15:33.937
controlling everything?

15:33.982 --> 15:36.131
What, you mean, am I a racist?

15:36.181 --> 15:43.097
Yeah. If you think that
and say those things, you're a racist, aren't you?

15:43.140 --> 15:44.778
Well... yeah.

15:44.820 --> 15:48.415
As it turns out... Daryl is a racist.

15:49.779 --> 15:52.418
You're sure he's a proper...

15:52.459 --> 15:55.928
It wasn't just racist... horseplay?

15:55.978 --> 16:01.336
No, because I was in the tent with him for ages
and we talked for a long time,

16:01.378 --> 16:06.929
and it was mostly on racial classifications -
head measurements and so on.

16:06.977 --> 16:08.694
Wow.

16:08.736 --> 16:13.685
I feel terrible.
Do you think I should... confront him?

16:13.736 --> 16:15.134
You mean you didn't confront him?

16:15.175 --> 16:18.247
Yeah. No, naturally I confronted him,

16:18.295 --> 16:23.322
but maybe I should... confront him... again, more.

16:23.374 --> 16:25.365
DOORBELL

16:29.013 --> 16:31.004
- Tell him I'm not here!
- Why?

16:31.053 --> 16:33.692
Because I didn't confront him, all right?

16:36.692 --> 16:37.727
Oh, hi, Daryl.

16:37.772 --> 16:42.242
- Hey, Jez. Is Mark around?
- No, he's gone out, to get a Thai curry.

16:42.291 --> 16:48.082
'Because that's what we eat nowadays
while you're chomping on your racist carrots.'

16:51.050 --> 16:53.769
Hope Jeff's neighbour
got the cheque for the window.

16:53.810 --> 16:59.805
So sorry. We were passing and I said, "Let's see
if they're in, throw some stones at the window."

16:59.849 --> 17:03.158
Daryl thought I said "a stone,"
and the stone he picked was a brick

17:03.208 --> 17:05.722
and he got the wrong window... You know the rest.

17:05.768 --> 17:07.645
Sorry I'm late, everyone. >

17:07.688 --> 17:09.962
Hey, Mark, my man!

17:10.007 --> 17:12.123
Hi...

17:12.166 --> 17:14.760
Is your mobile broke?
I've not been able to get you for days.

17:14.806 --> 17:18.594
Hey, they do chicken wings! I love chicken wings.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.239
So, Alan, why have you got us all down here?

17:21.285 --> 17:24.641
Well, I noticed a bit of static back in the office.

17:24.685 --> 17:27.722
Just thought we should come here
for a bit of a bonding sesh.

17:27.765 --> 17:31.643
- Oh, right. Great.
- So...

17:33.964 --> 17:36.761
- Anyone see the game last night?
- Er, no.

17:36.803 --> 17:42.320
I did. Thierry Henry
made Savage look like a right carthorse!

17:42.362 --> 17:47.595
Brilliant, wasn't he? When are people finally
gonna admit that you lot are better at sports?

17:47.642 --> 17:50.360
'No, not here. No, this can't happen! '

17:51.041 --> 17:55.477
- "You lot"?
- He means guys like you who are French.

17:55.520 --> 18:02.197
He thinks you're French! I keep telling you,
he's not French! Come on, let's get you a drink.

18:05.759 --> 18:10.149
Listen, mate, while we've got a minute -
the thing is...

18:10.198 --> 18:12.154
I'm busy, you're busy...

18:12.198 --> 18:16.554
I just think maybe we should stop
seeing each other so much.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.872
What, stop being mates?

18:18.917 --> 18:24.991
Yeah, you know, you say potato, I say tomato -
let's call the whole thing off.

18:25.036 --> 18:26.549
But why?

18:26.596 --> 18:29.746
Well, it's the 21st century,
no-one actually likes each other any more,

18:29.795 --> 18:32.434
so let's just leave it at that.

18:32.475 --> 18:35.147
But I do like you! I think you're fucking great!

18:35.194 --> 18:39.710
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but... I don't have time.
OK? There's no time.

18:41.113 --> 18:44.025
So let's just forget anything ever happened, OK?

18:44.073 --> 18:49.385
'It's OK, he doesn't have any feelings.
Racists don't have feelings, they're subhuman.

18:51.552 --> 18:55.669
'Yes, little Tetraminos,
you fit neatly together and dissolve

18:55.711 --> 18:58.703
'because everything is simple in Tetris world.'

18:59.071 --> 19:04.098
Er, Mark?
I've got a massive, massive favour to ask you.

19:04.150 --> 19:07.585
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah. It's, um...

19:07.629 --> 19:12.180
The thing is, Gog,
he's got some reservations about the track

19:12.229 --> 19:15.220
and he's holding out on the four grand
till we get it right.

19:15.268 --> 19:16.781
Uh-huh...

19:16.828 --> 19:20.422
But the thing is,
I've basically been very, very foolish,

19:20.467 --> 19:25.097
and I've spent all of our advance
on drugs and shoes...

19:25.147 --> 19:30.698
and I really need to borrow quite a lot of money
to go back into the studio and I was thinking...

19:30.746 --> 19:32.896
I mean, you are the manager...

19:33.945 --> 19:36.505
OK... How much?

19:36.545 --> 19:38.501
Brilliant! Now, the favour...

19:38.545 --> 19:40.136
That's not the favour?!

19:40.184 --> 19:44.382
Er... no. You see, the thing is, Gog...

19:44.424 --> 19:49.497
he's really not very keen at all
on any of the track...

19:49.543 --> 19:53.172
except, as it turns out, for the cor anglais.

19:53.223 --> 19:56.658
He wants much, much more cor anglais.

19:56.702 --> 20:00.216
No, Jeremy. You know what Daryl's like.

20:00.261 --> 20:03.173
No, sure. Yeah. Absolutely. Of course.

20:03.221 --> 20:07.418
But look at it another way -
we've all got our foibles.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.532
I mean, I, for example, hate mozzarella.

20:10.580 --> 20:11.979
It's not the same.

20:12.020 --> 20:14.408
It is kind of the same.

20:14.459 --> 20:18.008
I mean, aren't we supposed to be living
in a multicultural democracy?

20:18.099 --> 20:19.612
And isn't that the point?

20:19.659 --> 20:24.254
You know, the Jews and the Muslims and
the racists all living happily together, side by side,

20:24.298 --> 20:26.606
doing and saying whatever the hell they like?

20:28.137 --> 20:33.369
'Cor anglais, of course.
Probably plays it in the BNP jazz combo.'

20:33.416 --> 20:35.327
Brilliant, fantastic.

20:35.376 --> 20:36.855
What did you think, Hans?

20:36.896 --> 20:38.727
Crack! Just gimme crack!

20:38.776 --> 20:41.847
Well, I loved it.
If you want to print one of those out, or whatever.

20:43.695 --> 20:45.447
Jeremy, don't just go!

20:45.495 --> 20:47.246
I'll suck for crack!

20:47.294 --> 20:50.127
Come on, let's get you some crack!

20:50.174 --> 20:52.892
Tell Daryl we're very grateful.

20:54.813 --> 20:56.132
Great to hear from ya!

20:56.173 --> 20:59.767
You got over whatever brain attack
you had in Frankie and Benny's then?

20:59.812 --> 21:02.645
'I'm safe. In my cubicle, I'm safe.'

21:02.692 --> 21:05.286
So are we off for a pint, or what?

21:05.332 --> 21:08.403
Er, Daryl, listen, the truth is...

21:08.451 --> 21:13.319
I can't be associated with you any more,
because... you're a racist.

21:13.370 --> 21:17.158
What? Yeah, but I thought
we were on the same wavelength!

21:17.210 --> 21:19.803
You know, the sausage, the euro, Clarkson.

21:20.409 --> 21:24.561
There's a difference. Daryl, you can't hate people
because of their ethnic background!

21:24.609 --> 21:27.600
Oh, right. Political correctness gone mad.

21:28.248 --> 21:32.684
No! I hate political correctness gone mad
more than anyone!

21:32.727 --> 21:36.481
I don't wanna teach the world to sing,
that would be horrible,

21:36.527 --> 21:39.438
but slavery? The Holocaust?

21:39.486 --> 21:41.442
That's just not on!

21:41.486 --> 21:44.558
<i>Whereas, I Have A Dream...</i>

21:44.606 --> 21:47.358
South Africa, Benetton... It's...

21:47.405 --> 21:51.034
You've got to say, fair enough. Yeah?

21:51.885 --> 21:57.402
Yeah. OK, no. Fair enough. You've talked me
round.

21:58.204 --> 21:59.113
I have?

21:59.163 --> 22:01.723
Fuck off! Thought police!

22:03.083 --> 22:04.960
'Well. there he goes.

22:05.003 --> 22:08.881
'The first friend I've made
since Nick Bickford in '96.

22:08.922 --> 22:11.914
'And I'm pretty sure Nick didn't really like me.'

22:13.761 --> 22:16.434
Do we have to do this?
We're not going to hurt him, are we?

22:16.481 --> 22:21.429
You want your money back, don't you?
He's refusing to pay up or like the track.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.152
I told you you should've had a proper contract!

22:23.200 --> 22:25.997
- How are you feeling, Super Hans?
- Totally fine.

22:26.039 --> 22:27.757
You've kicked the crack?

22:27.799 --> 22:32.314
No, except now I bang a load of Valium
up me arsehole for the comedown.

22:35.598 --> 22:36.428
What's this?

22:36.478 --> 22:40.789
Cover. In case the cops turn up.
Just a bunch of mates playing baseball.

22:42.237 --> 22:46.627
Oh! Jeremy. Right, so, what,
you've had more thoughts about the track?

22:46.676 --> 22:48.189
Yeah, we have, actually.

22:48.236 --> 22:49.464
OK, great.

22:49.516 --> 22:52.587
Yeah. We thought we might smash your brains in
with a baseball bat.

22:52.635 --> 22:54.705
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

22:54.755 --> 22:59.544
See, we want our money,
and we're feeling a little bit clumsy...

22:59.594 --> 23:00.504
Whoops

23:00.554 --> 23:04.832
I've told you, it's out of my hands now.
The Honda people are very hard to please.

23:04.874 --> 23:08.149
Oh, Honda, Honda, Honda. Fuck Honda.

23:08.193 --> 23:10.309
Nice packet of Crunchy Nut you've got here.
Pretty expensive, as I recall.

23:14.272 --> 23:19.823
Not so rich and successful now
with a piece of wood in your face, mmm?

23:19.871 --> 23:21.384
Oi, Jez!

23:22.111 --> 23:25.785
Look, Jeremy, we can come back again, he's
got the message. You're gonna pay, aren't you?

23:25.830 --> 23:26.785
No.

23:26.830 --> 23:29.139
All right then. We've got our answer. Let's go!

23:29.190 --> 23:32.465
We've got to hurt him on principle.
Hit him with the fucking bat, Jez.

23:32.509 --> 23:35.899
Why do I have to? Why don't you do it?
Punch him with the glove.

23:35.949 --> 23:37.143
I can't even make a fist!

23:37.189 --> 23:43.058
The whole point of contract law, the whole point
of a contract is to make sure this never happens!

23:44.828 --> 23:46.658
- Don't answer it.
- What if it's Honda?

23:46.707 --> 23:48.618
- It's not going to be Honda.
- Could be Honda.

23:50.507 --> 23:55.375
All right, but a word out of place
and you're getting the bat.

23:56.386 --> 23:57.262
Hello?

23:57.306 --> 23:59.102
Honda!

23:59.145 --> 24:02.103
Oh, really? Oh, that's great news.

24:02.145 --> 24:05.454
I'm so pleased. Dave, call the police!
There's people here, they're trying to kill me,

24:05.504 --> 24:07.574
they're trying to kill me!

24:10.064 --> 24:14.181
Hello, er, Dave, it's Mark here.
I'm an old friend of Gog's.

24:14.223 --> 24:19.819
Don't worry, we're not trying to kill him,
it's just... he's never... had sushi before,

24:19.862 --> 24:21.932
he thought we were trying to poison him.

24:21.982 --> 24:25.496
It's all right, Gog, you're not meant to cook it,
it's supposed to be raw!

24:25.541 --> 24:27.532
Can he call you back?

24:30.381 --> 24:33.577
Hey, Mark. What's the big stink?

24:33.620 --> 24:35.417
Daryl's getting the sack.

24:35.460 --> 24:40.010
Apparently he was a massive racist
and not even his best friends knew.

24:40.059 --> 24:41.458
Someone reported him.

24:41.499 --> 24:42.898
Right!

24:44.858 --> 24:50.137
'Oh, shit! He knows, he knows it was me.
He's got a pipe bomb in his trousers.

24:50.178 --> 24:52.645

so you're in the clear there.

25:04.415 --> 25:07.373
So, well, I'll see you around, mate.

25:14.174 --> 25:18.564
Yeah, and good riddance, you... you fucking Nazi!

Everybody's comin' to get me</i>

25:33.851 --> 25:36.763

<i>I'm running underground
with the moles digging holes.</i>
