WEBVTT

01:53.029 --> 01:55.072
Huh?

02:07.794 --> 02:10.294
I hate Mondays.

02:19.222 --> 02:22.307
Pooky, cover me. I'm going in.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.478
Alley-oop.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.897
Ba-ba-ba-ba...

02:28.982 --> 02:30.816
Ha.

02:30.900 --> 02:35.529
Oh, sleeping beauty, wake up.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.740
You can stop dreaming about me,
because I'm here.

02:38.825 --> 02:43.495
Nowjust wake up. You've got work to do.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.916
You're not just my owner,
you're my primary caregiver, now...

02:48.001 --> 02:50.752
Not now, Garfield.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.463
All right. Cut the sweet stuff. Easy now.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.508
Just... ahh.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.219
Trying to cuddle with me, huh?

02:59.304 --> 03:02.723
Trying to avoid your duties, huh?

03:02.807 --> 03:06.435
Well, that just ain't gonna fly.
It don't work.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.565
See, I'm getting my exercise.
Doing my job.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.401
Just one quick... cannonball!

03:14.652 --> 03:16.111
- Morning.
- Garfield!

03:16.863 --> 03:20.324
Working nine to five

03:20.408 --> 03:24.786
OK. I think you're clean enough now.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.290
- Got your towel here.
- Garfield!

03:39.844 --> 03:42.262
- It's liver-flavored.
- Mm.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.890
Delicious. Yeugh.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.561
Mm. Mm.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.858
Oh. Oh, liver.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.654
Well. Actually, it's liver-flavored.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.784
Ah, that was a good breakfast.
Now I think I'll just fall off the Catkins diet

04:03.868 --> 04:06.495
and get myself a little high-fat chaser.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.665
- Mm.
- Garfield, look, the milk truck.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.085
Oh, attaboy, Nermal.
The milk truck comes every day.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.255
Maybe not today.
Maybe it's changing routes.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.632
Maybe this'll be the last we'll see of it.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.760
It's just across the street.
We're cats, we like milk. Go for it.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.844
- No.
- But...

04:22.929 --> 04:26.932
"But" nothing.
I don't leave the cul-de-sac for anything.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.559
Out there it's a hornet's nest of trouble.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.563
Bad things happen out there,
so I don't go out there.

04:33.690 --> 04:39.820
Besides, I've found, if you wait
for long enough, everything comes to you.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.657
Here come da milkman
Here come da milkman

04:43.741 --> 04:45.742
He got his shoes on...

04:45.910 --> 04:49.371
- Hey, Nermal, let's play astronaut again.
- Yeah?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.914
I love that game.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.834
- You're a brave astronaut.
- All right.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.921
- Prepare to jump into your spaceship.
- But what about the milk?

04:58.047 --> 05:00.674
Who needs milk
when you can be in outer space?

05:00.758 --> 05:02.676
- You got a secret mission.
- Yeah?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.886
You'll be exploring the Milky Way.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.931
I get the chills when you jump
in your spacecraft.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.391
The nation thanks you.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.643
- Prepare to blast off.
- I'm ready to go.

05:11.728 --> 05:15.439
- Three, two, one.
- Whoa.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.275
- Bon voyage.
- Look at me go!

05:18.401 --> 05:20.819
- Don't look down.
- I'm an eagle flying.

05:20.903 --> 05:25.240
- Come to papa, baby.
- I can see everything from here.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.450
I can see my house.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.537
- Got milk?
- I can see the whole neighborhood.

05:30.621 --> 05:34.249
- That's nice. That's very nice.
- Hey! There's another milk truck.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.837
- And that is even nicer.
- I can see... Whoa!

05:38.921 --> 05:41.423
- Mission accomplished, Nermal.
- Whoa.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.885
Garfield, do it again.
Where did everybody go?

05:44.969 --> 05:47.929
You're on the wrong side
of the street, fat cat. Beat it.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.475
And you, Luca, the wrong side
of the evolutionary curve.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.394
OK, that's it.
You're gonna get it good today.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.938
I make a point to get it good every day.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.566
The question is, how shall I outwit you?

05:59.650 --> 06:02.069
- What?
- Shall I baffle you with simple math?

06:02.153 --> 06:03.695
I can spell.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.530
Shall I distract you
with something shiny?

06:05.615 --> 06:08.825
- You're making fun of me.
- I hope so, you're no fun to look at.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.078
You'll never get the best of me.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.790
- I think I just did.
- Not the ducks again.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.836
Kiss myself.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.258
If I ever get off this chain,
you're going down.

06:25.343 --> 06:29.304
Everybody back up, I don't know
how wild this thing is gonna get.

06:29.639 --> 06:35.102
I love the smell of cinnamon apple
in the morning. Smells like... victory.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.562
Oh, I hate this fat cat.

06:40.775 --> 06:45.362
So much time and so little I need to do.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.660
- Mouse!
- No, thanks. I'm full.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.333
- Get him, Garfield.
- Get him, Jon.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.010
It's always got to be smashing
and crashing.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.556
Nobody poisons anymore.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.349
Aha!

07:17.061 --> 07:19.271
There's my ball.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.441
What good is a cat
that can't chase a mouse?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.568
I don't do the chase thing.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.696
All right. I'll handle this.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.534
I know you don't hear me,
but can't you just listen?

07:36.706 --> 07:41.835
- What are you doing inside when Jon's in?
- Sorry, Garfield, man. I couldn't help it.

07:41.919 --> 07:44.754
When he sees you,
he expects more from me. Get that?

07:44.881 --> 07:48.884
Jon's got those nut cookies.
I'm trying to maintain. Understand?

07:48.968 --> 07:51.553
Sure. As long as you understand
I have to eat you.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.679
Aw.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.768
Mm.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.564
Mm. Mm.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.901
Mm!

08:05.985 --> 08:10.113
Oh, good boy. See? I knew you could do it
if you put your mind to it.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.408
- You're the best cat a guy could have.
- Mm.

08:15.119 --> 08:17.245
Mm. Mm.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.002
Have you tasted yourself lately?

08:24.086 --> 08:26.755
It wasn't the first-class lounge
in there either.

08:26.839 --> 08:31.092
Get lost, Louis. Take a powder for a couple
of days. Get a haircut. Grow a beard.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.719
Cool. I owe you one, G.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.932
I've got a question for you.
Do you love your cat?

08:37.475 --> 08:41.019
Finally. Back on my regular schedule.

08:41.102 --> 08:44.397
...Kibbly Kat food.
Isn't that right, Persnikitty?

08:44.482 --> 08:49.110
That cat's puss is everywhere.
TV, newspapers, T-shirts.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.030
Who would want that kind of exposure?

08:54.242 --> 08:55.200
Hey, buddy.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.953
Yeah, cut the small talk.
What's in the bag?

08:58.120 --> 09:01.706
- Remember, be happy.
- I'm happy when I'm with you,

09:01.791 --> 09:06.670
you delicate mÃ©lange of tomato paste,
ricotta cheese, ground meat and pasta.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.465
Garfield, don't even think about it.
That's my food.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.553
- I may just nibble.
- Thanks, Happy.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.223
And thank you forjoining us.
I'm Christopher Mello. Remember...

09:18.307 --> 09:20.642
Be happy.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.187
OK, cut.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.814
We're clear.

09:27.650 --> 09:32.487
Gimme the Benadryl.
Gimme the Benadryl. Yeah. Yeah.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.577
Damned cat allergies.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.793
Any word from the network yet?

09:46.877 --> 09:49.254
No, but they want a dog act on
Good Day New York.

09:49.338 --> 09:54.718
Dog act? Story of my life.
Looking for a dog and I'm stuck with a cat.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.305
- The segment went well.
- The segment went well.

09:58.389 --> 10:03.184
Of course it went well, you toad.
The 50 housewives who saw it loved it.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.689
This is Walter J. Chapman,
reporting live from The Hague.

10:07.773 --> 10:11.610
Oh, please. What a know-it-all.

10:11.694 --> 10:15.030
And everybody always said
I was the handsome one.

10:15.281 --> 10:19.075
I was the smart one. And I was born first.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.328
But there you are "live from The Hague"

10:21.412 --> 10:23.538
and here I am working
with this sack of dander

10:23.623 --> 10:25.957
on a dead-end regional morning show.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.083
Back to you, Dan.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.297
Garfield!

10:33.466 --> 10:36.051
Did you eat all four boxes of lasagne?

10:36.761 --> 10:39.638
It's not my fault. They started it.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.850
- What am I gonna do with you?
- Love me, feed me, never leave me.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.478
Let's go for a ride to someplace you love,

10:46.562 --> 10:49.314
that always leaves you pampered
and refreshed.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.941
Oh, I know, Chuck E Cheese's.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.486
Thank you.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.821
No? Wendy's?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.990
Taco Kitty? No?

10:59.450 --> 11:02.661
Well, I'm stumped.
Maybe Olive Garden. For you?

11:02.745 --> 11:03.787
Hm.

11:03.871 --> 11:08.708
The only time I ever leave my cul-de-sac
is when Jon takes me to the vet.

11:08.793 --> 11:13.672
Which he's been doing a lot recently, and it
appears to have nothing to do with me.

11:13.756 --> 11:17.258
Jon must want to go for his own reason.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.681
There's nothing wrong with Garfield.
He's just a happy, fat, lazy cat.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.183
- No need for a second opinion.
- I worry about him.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.436
I know you do. Ooh.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.523
You care about him
more than any owner I've known.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.609
"Him" has a name. Is this an HMO?

11:34.985 --> 11:38.780
Let's get Garfield in for his dip.
I wanna talk to you. In private.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.618
She's so beautiful.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.705
Mr. Pathetic? You've had a crush
on her since school.

11:46.789 --> 11:51.042
Would you please ask her out so she can
reject you and we can get on with my life?

11:51.335 --> 11:53.795
I have to ask her out. Wish me luck.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.256
OK. Go get 'em, big tiger.

11:56.340 --> 12:00.468
You the man. You the fella.
You the boss. You preach to her.

12:00.553 --> 12:05.724
Show her how the cow eats the cabbage,
you... hopeless loser.

12:06.642 --> 12:10.145
Betty, today why don't you start me off
with a Swedish massage,

12:10.229 --> 12:12.313
a manicure and a pedicure, OK?

12:12.398 --> 12:18.987
Seaweed wrap, loofah, belly rub, tail
waxing and then crack my toes to finish.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.366
Jon, there's something important
I need to ask you.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.077
Something I wouldn't ask
most guys that come in.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.038
Wait, no.
I think I know where this is going.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.707
- You do?
- I do.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.918
Liz, I've wanted to ask you the same thing
for a long time.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.005
- Are we talking about the same thing?
- Absolutely.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.758
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.385
Liz, I'm ready to take a chance.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.012
I am ready for...

12:46.390 --> 12:48.767
- Thank you.
- A dog.

12:50.728 --> 12:54.230
A do... I'm ready for a dog.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.275
- I think he likes you.
- Hi. Yeah.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.818
Hi.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.071
Oh, he's a frisky little fella, isn't he?

13:02.156 --> 13:06.659
His name's Odie and he's not gonna
make it if he has to live his life in a cage.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.037
He needs to be loved.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.799
Thank you very much.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.718
No, maybe not in my neighborhood.

13:24.386 --> 13:27.680
Hey, Boomer, I really got to run.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.724
Gotta fly, everybody. Really.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.394
Stay behind the security fence.
It's great of you to come see me,

13:33.479 --> 13:37.106
but I've got somebody waiting,
very devoted, almost crippled.

13:37.191 --> 13:40.819
No, please, don't cry.
I know what it's like to be unloved.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.196
Well, you do.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.241
I'll come back and visit
and if I don't, I'll try to write.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.829
- Does anybody know this guy?
- Bye-bye. Garfield is leaving the building.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.998
Jon, you know you don't have
to do this if you don't want to.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.417
No. No, it's OK.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.670
Part of me's always wondered
what it'd be like to have a pet

13:58.754 --> 14:01.381
that wants to play with you.

14:01.465 --> 14:06.427
- You're a good friend.
- One question. Am I still gorgeous?

14:07.972 --> 14:11.516
Jon. I think we've got
a little problem here. Uh, Jon?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.269
And I can help the transition go smoothly.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.187
It's in my seat.

14:16.272 --> 14:20.692
We could all go out together.
Park, dog shows, stuff like that.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.193
Jonny boy?

14:22.278 --> 14:25.947
Wait a minute, are you... asking me out?

14:26.782 --> 14:30.785
Oh, Jonny boy,
the time has come to get a car alarm.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.247
You won't believe it.
A mongrel mutt has broken into your car.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.083
Garfield, this is Odie.
He's coming home with us.

14:37.167 --> 14:40.753
Whoa. You went in there to get a date
and came out with a dog?

14:40.838 --> 14:44.048
Well, that's bad even for you.
You're so sad.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.886
Oh, no, no, no.
We're not bringing a dog home with us.

14:47.970 --> 14:51.180
Hey! I ride shotgun.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.349
What are you looking at, tick boy?

14:54.685 --> 15:00.481
Jon, it's not too late. Quickly. Turn around
before he finds out where we live!

15:03.152 --> 15:06.321
Please take this trouser-sniffer back.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.489
- Please?
- Come on, Odie. Let's go.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.409
It's your new home.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.251
- Come on, buddy.
- Jon...

15:20.336 --> 15:26.007
You had me, a chick magnet,
and now you got a tick magnet.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.889
- Garfield. Jon brought a dog home.
- I am aware, Nermal.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.559
- Why would he do a thing like that?
- Gee, I don't know, Nermal.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.811
It just seems like a weird thing to do,

15:38.896 --> 15:41.439
bringing a dog into a house
that already has a cat.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.108
Can we drop it? I mean, it's no big deal.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.487
It's... just a splattered bug
on the windshield of my life.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.655
A bug?

15:48.739 --> 15:52.659
A dim-witted, smelly,
goofy splattered bug,

15:52.743 --> 15:55.328
to deal with appropriately
and enthusiastically.

15:55.412 --> 15:58.623
- Come on!
- As you can see, I'm still Jon's favorite.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.626
See you later.
Good luck with the bug thing.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.087
Come on.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.633
Ha! This is payback for the liver thing,
isn't it?

16:08.717 --> 16:11.928
Payback. He's a nut.

16:12.429 --> 16:16.015
This is your new home, Odie.
That's my office over there.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.518
And the TV over there.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.895
And now, the kitchen. Wanna go see it?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.189
OK. Go see that. Go see.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.567
Why don't you draw him a map?

16:26.986 --> 16:30.738
OK. I've got to remain calm, that's all.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.199
Jon's a cat guy, not a dog guy.

16:33.283 --> 16:36.160
This'll last a week, maybe ten days, tops.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.914
Boy, this puppy is Stupid Gone Wild.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.251
This is just a bad dream. I'll close my eyes

16:43.335 --> 16:48.089
and when I open them,
everything will be back to normal.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.931
That's not normal. Not close.

16:57.016 --> 17:01.644
Oh, great, dog cooties.
Somebody inoculate me, please.

17:05.315 --> 17:11.279
This is a nightmare. I just need a little
quality time with man's real best friend.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.656
Television.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.201
Heh heh heh.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.372
No, no, no!

17:21.457 --> 17:24.791
Hey, new guy.
Let me hip you to the rules, OK?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.086
Number one, that's my chair.

17:27.171 --> 17:32.467
All right? I even see you raise a leg
and it's on, it's go time, pal.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.055
Very well.

17:49.485 --> 17:53.404
Yeah, I think I just may have
a mental advantage on this guy.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.754
Leave me alone.
I'm not kidding, Yodel Odie.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.591
Pop a worm pill and hit the road. I'm busy.

18:14.009 --> 18:17.386
You want to play? Fine.
You can be my new astronaut.

18:17.513 --> 18:22.016
Go jump in the pail and we'll shoot you
into outer space. C'mon, it's real simple.

18:22.101 --> 18:26.395
Here. I'll even throw your ball in there.
Follow the ball and jump in the pail.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.898
Come on, Odie. Just like this.

18:29.024 --> 18:33.194
Come on over here and jump
right into the pail and help me. Come on.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.948
No. Just in here, like this.
Uh-oh. Don't touch that.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.117
Argh!

18:42.871 --> 18:44.872
Oh, no!

18:51.213 --> 18:53.256
Argh!

18:53.382 --> 18:54.465
Ah.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.971
Oh, no.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.978
Houston, we have a problem.

19:07.062 --> 19:10.064
Odie, get off the pail.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.733
Would you get off the pail, please?

19:12.818 --> 19:15.069
OK, time for a new game.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.989
It's called "My Claw In Your Butt" game.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.991
C'mere. Get back here.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.785
Come on. I'll just use my left claw.

19:23.078 --> 19:26.164
If my legs were longer
I'd have caught you by now. C'mere.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.917
Just wait for one second. Slow down.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.506
Well, well, well. I've got you now, fat cat.

19:35.591 --> 19:39.552
Hey, Luca. Is that a new chain
you're wearing, fella?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.971
Looks good. You look great.
Been working out?

19:42.055 --> 19:46.475
- I've been waiting years for this.
- Would that be regular years or dog years?

19:49.938 --> 19:53.649
What the? Get away from me, pipsqueak.
You're nothing but a...

19:53.775 --> 19:59.113
Luca, this is Odie. Odie, Luca. Luca, do me
a favor and eat him, would you, please?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.948
Are you all right?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.701
I think so.
Luca's gonna have Odie for lunch.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.746
If it wasn't for Odie,
you'd be Luca's chew toy.

20:06.830 --> 20:10.833
Yeah, he saved your life. Odie's a hero!

20:10.918 --> 20:15.504
Why? Because I wasn't ripped to shreds?
No. Odie's an imbecile until further notice.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.262
Hey, moon dust. If I were you
I'd grab a nice piece of carpet.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.890
Jon doesn't let me sleep up top. Ever.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.769
Odie.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.147
You want to sleep in the bed? OK.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.066
Wh...?

20:35.150 --> 20:39.570
Hey, buddy. Good boy.
Who's a good boy, huh?

20:39.863 --> 20:43.074
Want to sleep on the bed tonight?
"Yes, I do!"

20:43.158 --> 20:46.869
I think I'm going to blow cat chow chunks.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.330
G'night, Odie. G'night, Garfield.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.041
Great. Wish me luck with the nightmares.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.726
Another day ruined.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.405
Oh, you little suck-up. Oh.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.912
Whoa! Whoa, baby.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.210
No. Down.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.379
Down, dumb dog.

21:43.385 --> 21:47.221
What part of "no" don't you understand?
The push off the chair?

21:47.306 --> 21:50.308
Off! I don't want to play.

21:51.893 --> 21:56.480
Look. What am I supposed to say?
"Thanks for saving my hide with Luca?"

21:56.565 --> 22:00.526
OK, "Thanks for saving my hide
with Luca. " Get off!

22:00.610 --> 22:02.903
Where was I? Right here. I was right here.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.573
Whoa!

22:05.657 --> 22:09.410
That was a cheap shot.
Hit a guy when he's not looking? OK.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.580
Oh, excuse me. I think
you may have forgotten something.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.750
I saw this and I thought...
pretty sure it was yours.

22:15.917 --> 22:19.211
Oh, I love to dish it out.

22:20.339 --> 22:25.092
Watch out. You see?
You can't touch this. Come on. Uh-huh.

22:25.594 --> 22:29.096
That's right. Don't sneak up on me, baby.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.516
Oh, come on with that.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.061
Get that weak stuff out of here.

22:35.145 --> 22:39.565
Is that butt broken?
No, it's something like this, here.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.984
Can you do this?

22:42.110 --> 22:44.445
Shouldn't those hips be in the shop?

22:44.529 --> 22:48.741
Walk this way, please. I'm walking the dog.

22:48.825 --> 22:52.745
Let's step it up a little bit.
Something like this.

22:52.829 --> 22:56.665
Oh, look at this. Watch out now.
Watch out for this thing. It could go.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.501
Uh-huh.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.503
You should've practiced in the garage

23:00.587 --> 23:03.798
before you stepped up
with someone of my level.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.884
Back up.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.719
Maybe something
a little more challenging.

23:08.804 --> 23:12.723
Hey! How about this? Out the front door.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.062
Look who's here on the porch.

23:18.146 --> 23:22.233
I'm walking the porch, holding a torch,
I'm ready to scorch.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.610
Uh-huh. That's fancy footwork.

23:24.694 --> 23:28.823
Hey. Look, Garfield's dancing with Odie.
They're like buddies now.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.826
What's the matter? Oh, my God.
Odie, what are you doing here?

23:31.910 --> 23:35.204
I was doing a solo dance and a creepy dog
comes up next to me.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.330
Did you guys see that?

23:36.748 --> 23:39.250
Thank you, fellas, thank you. Uh-oh.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.043
Here's more trouble.

23:46.675 --> 23:51.345
- Look at the goony look on his face.
- C'mon, buddy. Come here.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.931
Hey, taking him back to the vet?

23:54.015 --> 23:55.724
You're taking him
back to the kennel, right?

23:55.851 --> 23:56.976
Yeah?

23:57.060 --> 24:00.146
Are you putting him up for adoption?

24:00.230 --> 24:05.109
Hey, Garfield. Jon's taking Odie on his date
with Liz and he's leaving you behind.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.569
I know, Nermal.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.280
They're off on an adventure
and you're here.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.157
And your point is?

24:11.241 --> 24:16.370
Well, that's gotta feel bad,
being left by Jon while he takes Odie out.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.540
It's like you're not his favorite anymore.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.208
Hey, what do you say we play
brain surgeon?

24:21.293 --> 24:24.211
Would you go get my power tools?

24:26.089 --> 24:29.550
This is so sad.
Jon has completely lost his mind.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.678
Doesn't realize how important I am to him.

24:32.804 --> 24:37.516
I need to be so very understanding of him
at this difficult time.

24:37.601 --> 24:41.020
Hey, wait up! Wait up for me!
You forgot me!

24:41.104 --> 24:43.522
Slow down. Please, slow down.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.066
I'm right back here.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.943
I think I pulled a hamstring.

24:52.407 --> 24:55.242
It's OK. I'm on. I'm on. Relax.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.832
Oh, my poor nose.

25:02.417 --> 25:08.506
So, if you own Marine, please
come and claim her. Thank you very much.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.687
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

25:23.772 --> 25:27.900
It's probably just a mild concussion
or a skull fracture.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.069
Maybe I'll get a CAT scan.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.446
A CAT scan.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.658
I'd like to ask the judges now if they would

25:35.742 --> 25:38.619
please take their positions
for the viewings.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.038
Watch your step there.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.382
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the dog show.

25:51.466 --> 25:56.637
What if I compromised? How about I do
the rolling around with the yarn ball thing?

25:56.721 --> 26:02.184
And I'll purr. I'll purr like a Ferrari.
Or make that a Jaguar.

26:02.310 --> 26:06.939
I won't climb drapes. That's more
than you get from some dumb dog.

26:07.023 --> 26:09.608
Oops. Dogs. Uh-oh.

26:10.151 --> 26:13.988
Oh, what?
You all going to take it personally?

26:14.281 --> 26:18.492
Now I'm gonna die.
Oh, no, I really am gonna die!

26:18.743 --> 26:22.037
Excuse me. Can I get through here?

26:22.122 --> 26:24.123
No one under this tarp.
Argh. That's my ear.

26:24.207 --> 26:29.211
Owners, maintain control of your dogs.
Please. Control those animals now.

26:29.337 --> 26:32.298
Music. Music, you idiot.

26:34.342 --> 26:38.637
Yeah, play the music.
That's my bad knee. Stop it.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.348
All right. Feet, don't fail me now.

26:42.976 --> 26:48.606
I apologize for this. Please excuse
this outburst. This is highly irregular.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.107
Odie.

26:50.191 --> 26:55.362
Odie. Odie, come on.
Come on, buddy. Odie, want a treat, huh?

26:57.198 --> 26:59.575
OK. I need a ride.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.369
Madam, I'm a cat in trouble,
I'm hitching a ride in your muu-muu.

27:02.829 --> 27:05.164
Come on. Let's move.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.791
Go, let's move. Dig, dig.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.378
Come on, Pinkie. Move it out. Sorry. Sorry.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.636
Move, move, move, Pinkie.
Move, Pinkie, move.

27:18.720 --> 27:23.015
We certainly have a new star in the arena.

27:23.099 --> 27:26.226
Ladies and gentlemen, this is amazing.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.398
Talented little fella, huh?

27:32.108 --> 27:37.446
Yah, Pinkie, yah. They're gaining on us,
Pinkie. A cat's life is at stake.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.617
Thanks for the ride.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.119
Excuse me, ma'am. Please call 911.

27:47.457 --> 27:51.418
This is exactly what I deserve anyway.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.963
I promise if I survive
I'll never compete with a dog again.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.966
OK. You got me.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.428
But before I say goodbye...
Oh, isn't this the final irony?

28:01.513 --> 28:04.348
Look who's here to witness this.
The mailman!

28:05.058 --> 28:06.767
You're so stupid.

28:20.323 --> 28:24.535
Odie, come here. That's a good boy.

28:24.619 --> 28:28.580
Ladies and gentlemen, Happy Chapman.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.960
That is one talented dog.

28:34.879 --> 28:39.091
This is exactly the kind of dog
that could have a future in television.

28:39.175 --> 28:42.344
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chapman,
but Odie's just my pet.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.555
And that's all I really want him to be.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.725
- You're kidding?
- No.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.351
OK.

28:49.477 --> 28:52.146
Well, this is for you.

28:52.230 --> 28:56.900
And this is for you. If you happen
to change your mind, you just ring me up.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.236
"Hello? Hello? I changed my mind. "

28:59.320 --> 29:01.405
- "I want to be a star. "
- OK.

29:01.489 --> 29:02.614
- OK.
- OK.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.409
Let's hear it for Odie.

29:05.493 --> 29:10.414
What a sensationaI ending
to a rather unconventional show.

29:10.707 --> 29:16.170
Our winner today,
a fabulous dancing puppy called Odie.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.841
Never leave the cul-de-sac.

29:20.925 --> 29:24.219
Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de-sac.

29:24.345 --> 29:27.389
Never leave the cul-de... Uh.

29:27.515 --> 29:30.184
I'm home.

29:30.935 --> 29:34.605
- I had fun today. Thank you.
- Yeah, me too.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.024
- Would you like to come in?
- Not today.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.652
- I knew that. I'm sorry.
- I want to come over, just not today.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.030
I have to cover for another vet.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.199
Oh. Really?

29:45.533 --> 29:47.659
How's Sunday?

29:47.786 --> 29:51.455
Sunday's great. Sunday's good. Sunday...

29:52.373 --> 29:54.792
OK.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.171
So, I'll...

29:59.255 --> 30:02.007
- I'll see you Sunday.
- Sunday.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.884
Sunday.

30:07.472 --> 30:11.850
Why? Why has this happened?
I was the one.

30:11.935 --> 30:17.981
It was all about me, not about
some stupid, sniveling, smelly,

30:18.066 --> 30:21.193
high-maintenance disco dog.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.084
Oh, no.

31:18.293 --> 31:21.879
You can't do this. He's trying
to tear us apart. Don't you see?

31:21.963 --> 31:25.048
You know me. I'm too lazy
to try to destroy your house.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.468
I was provoked. Pushed.
Prodded. Driven mad.

31:28.553 --> 31:32.973
You can't kick me out of my own house
like I'm some kind of animal.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.142
Oh, come on, Jon. Jon.

31:36.811 --> 31:39.646
You know I'm scared of the dark.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.276
That's a good boy.

31:44.360 --> 31:48.238
Used to have Jon to myself

31:48.323 --> 31:52.826
Day or night there was no one else

31:52.994 --> 31:56.788
From dawn to dusk my meals would come

31:56.873 --> 32:01.126
I'd lounge about in my home

32:01.377 --> 32:05.339
But now I'm out in the cold of night

32:05.423 --> 32:09.343
All alone till the dawn's first light

32:10.386 --> 32:16.683
I'm in a new dog state of mind

32:22.857 --> 32:26.526
Used to think I had a home

32:26.611 --> 32:30.989
A speciaI place to call my own

32:31.074 --> 32:34.868
But now the dog's in and I'm out

32:35.078 --> 32:40.415
I've got no Jon, I've got no clout

32:49.300 --> 32:56.098
I'm in a new dog state of mind

33:03.564 --> 33:06.733
Leave me alone. You've won.

33:06.818 --> 33:11.405
You're inside with him
and I'm out here all by myself.

33:36.764 --> 33:40.434
Odie. You came out here to be with me?

33:40.518 --> 33:42.644
I'm touched.

33:42.770 --> 33:46.481
And you must be touched in the head.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.734
Kick out the dog, bring in the cat

33:48.818 --> 33:51.111
Yakety-yak, don't talk back

33:51.195 --> 33:53.321
See you in the morning, little fella.

33:54.449 --> 33:58.201
You know, a puppy needs
a little tough love every now and then.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.579
I think it builds character.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.081
Hello, Pooky. Miss me?

34:03.166 --> 34:06.460
You know what?
I'm gonna make it up to Odie tomorrow.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.170
I'm gonna teach him
how to drink out of the toilet.

34:10.630 --> 34:15.177
- Poor Odie. That cat is such a pig.
- Garfield's a pig?

34:15.303 --> 34:18.138
- You never put the dog out at night.
- Why not?

34:19.724 --> 34:21.891
Because dogs... run away.

35:46.727 --> 35:52.524
Sure, Jon,
I'll eat all your lasagne for you.

35:59.073 --> 36:02.576
Oh, look. What do we have here?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.912
You're a lost dog.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.002
Well, we can fix that.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.509
Oh, do I feel good this morning.

36:19.594 --> 36:25.432
I slept like a fat cat. Hey, tall, dark
and human, what's for breakfast?

36:25.516 --> 36:28.143
Odie. Where are you, boy?

36:28.269 --> 36:31.688
Oh, relax. I think he was gonna camp out.

36:32.607 --> 36:33.648
Odie?

36:33.733 --> 36:37.944
Well, probably had
a sleepover at Luca's, I think.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.948
Odie?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.491
Odie?

36:43.618 --> 36:44.743
Hm.

36:44.827 --> 36:50.290
Well, maybe he's fetching the paper
for the neighbors.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.125
Where is that silly dog?

36:56.797 --> 37:01.343
I can't go on like this anymore, Wendell.
I've got to get a dog.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.428
That's a lovely idea.

37:03.512 --> 37:06.473
You've been lonely since the divorce,
and I've tried to be a friend...

37:06.557 --> 37:09.517
Not for me, you imbecile. For the act.

37:09.644 --> 37:13.563
If I could get my hands on
a really talented dog,

37:13.648 --> 37:17.067
wouldn't Walter J just choke on his Emmy?

37:17.151 --> 37:19.778
- Like Odie?
- Yeah.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.989
Yeah, now he was good.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.616
Oh, yeah.

37:24.700 --> 37:28.370
He was kinda dopey-looking and spry and...

37:28.829 --> 37:29.829
Lost.

37:36.629 --> 37:40.757
It's Jon. I was just calling to see
if Odie's been over. I can't find him.

37:40.841 --> 37:43.927
My name is Jon Arbuckle
and I can't find my dog.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.513
Looked around and I can't find him...

37:46.597 --> 37:49.516
I haven't seen him.
If you see him, give me a call.

37:49.600 --> 37:53.895
Hi, it's Jon. I was calling to see
if you'd seen Odie. I think he's run away.

37:54.021 --> 37:57.357
I gave him a bath and I forgot to put
his collar back on.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.442
Well, cos Garfield hates his collar.

37:59.694 --> 38:03.363
He's about 15 pounds, brownish-yellow
with brown floppy ears...

38:04.532 --> 38:08.618
- Would you mind getting that?
- I'm offering a reward.

38:08.703 --> 38:12.414
Yeah, that's right.
OK, and he answers to the name of...

38:12.540 --> 38:14.958
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.877
I'd say the refrigerator is unguarded.

38:19.213 --> 38:22.966
- What are you doing here?
- We're having dinner, remember?

38:23.050 --> 38:26.303
Right. Dinner. The two of us.

38:26.387 --> 38:29.639
Tonight. Of course.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.643
- Shall I come in?
- Yeah. Yeah, come on in.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.565
You know, Liz, I have a confession.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.818
It's not really a confession,
it's more of an admission.

38:41.902 --> 38:45.488
It's... You know what it is,
it's like a declaration.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.867
- I have a...
- I love it when you do that.

38:48.951 --> 38:52.329
- Do what?
- You know. Trip over yourself.

38:52.413 --> 38:57.709
It's cute. And it's one of the reasons
I had a crush on you in high school.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.961
- You had a crush on me?
- Yeah.

39:00.087 --> 39:04.466
I thought you were really cute.
Decent, not like all those otherjerks.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.968
I don't believe it. I had a crush on you too.

39:07.094 --> 39:10.013
- Isn't that funny?
- Yeah.

39:10.097 --> 39:12.515
Hilarious.

39:12.600 --> 39:17.103
So, what's your
confession-admission-declaration?

39:17.938 --> 39:19.981
Actually, um...

39:22.151 --> 39:24.778
I forgot about our dinner. Yeah.

39:26.614 --> 39:30.325
- That's OK. I can go.
- No, no, I'm glad you're here.

39:30.409 --> 39:34.287
Let me just get my jacket
and then we'll go.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.045
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What...

39:42.129 --> 39:45.799
What am I gonna do?
I've waited for tonight my entire life.

39:45.883 --> 39:50.428
If you tell her the truth, you'll feel better.
And you won't have to see her anymore.

39:50.554 --> 39:53.765
It's kinda creepy having a vet
around the house anyway.

39:53.849 --> 39:56.267
I can't pretend like nothing's happened,
can I?

39:56.352 --> 40:00.605
Well, I sure could. The one thing
you can't do is tell her the dog's gone.

40:00.981 --> 40:03.149
- I gotta tell her.
- No.

40:03.234 --> 40:07.153
- Gotta tell her.
- No. That's not what I said.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.363
Schmuck.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.992
- Liz, we can't go out tonight.
- Why not?

40:13.244 --> 40:15.161
- Odie's run away.
- What?

40:15.246 --> 40:17.622
He got out last night. I called the pound.

40:17.706 --> 40:21.209
I put up posters.
I looked everywhere, but I can't find him.

40:21.544 --> 40:24.337
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I guess I figured

40:24.422 --> 40:27.298
he was the only reason
you were spending time with me.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.135
- Come on.
- No, serious. I-I...

40:30.219 --> 40:33.555
No. I mean, "Come on, let's go find him. "

40:33.764 --> 40:34.889
Oh.

40:39.186 --> 40:41.563
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

40:41.689 --> 40:46.985
How can this dog be such a problem
when he's not even here anymore?

40:47.069 --> 40:48.945
Well, I'm not gonna worry about him.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.406
I believe you found my dog.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.868
- He answers to "Odie".
- Odie?

40:54.952 --> 40:56.786
Family name.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.373
Oh! Odie!

41:00.458 --> 41:03.251
Oh, come on! There you are.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.378
Ah. Oh.

41:06.922 --> 41:11.217
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.511
I can live again now.

41:13.596 --> 41:18.266
- How can I ever repay you?
- An autograph would be splendid.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.852
Then splendid it shall be.

41:21.937 --> 41:23.897
Hmm.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.565
No.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.739
Hmm...

41:36.243 --> 41:38.119
This is ridiculous.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.499
- What are you looking at?
- Just looking for some company.

41:42.583 --> 41:45.126
- Keep walking, creepo.
- What's going on?

41:45.252 --> 41:48.671
We know how much you hated Odie
and how much you wanted him gone.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.424
Wait. All I wanted
was to sleep in my own bed.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.385
To do it you cast Odie out
into the cold, cruel world.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.846
We saw you lock Odie outside last night.

41:56.931 --> 42:01.684
I don't believe you guys. I didn't know
he was gonna run away. He's a dumb dog.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.895
- No offense, Luca.
- Uh, what?

42:03.979 --> 42:07.023
- You can't blame me.
- Any one of us could be next.

42:07.107 --> 42:11.110
Yeah. There's no room
for anybody else in Garfield's world.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.696
Huh? That's a little dramatic.

42:13.781 --> 42:17.033
Well, I may have been a little tough
about protecting my turf,

42:17.117 --> 42:20.662
but... I don't hate the guy.

42:21.455 --> 42:26.042
I understand Happy has a big surprise
for us. What have you got for us, Hap?

42:26.126 --> 42:28.878
Guten Morgen, Chris. Yeah, yeah, ja.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.464
I have been working
with a speciaI new friend,

42:31.549 --> 42:35.426
and I would like to
introduce him to all of you.

42:35.511 --> 42:38.846
Odie Schnitzel.

42:40.641 --> 42:43.351
Looky here. It's Odie.

42:43.477 --> 42:48.898
He's safe and sound. Although he seems
to have found an alternative lifestyle.

42:48.983 --> 42:52.694
He still can't dance. This gets me
off the hook with Jon and the gang.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.696
Now, I'm gonna be the hero.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.073
That's one talented dog.

42:57.157 --> 43:01.202
I'm glad you think so, Chris,
because I have a little announcement.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.580
Old Happy Chapman and Odie Schnitzel

43:03.664 --> 43:04.747
are gonna be climbing aboard

43:04.832 --> 43:08.626
that New Amsterdam Limited
bound to New York City,

43:08.711 --> 43:11.462
where we have the opportunity
to be regular contributors

43:11.547 --> 43:13.506
on "Good Day New York".

43:14.008 --> 43:16.509
Huh? That's his last name, "Schnitzel"?

43:16.594 --> 43:19.554
Thank you for your help yesterday.
You were great.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.932
Jon, Odie's on TV,
and he's wearing lederhosen.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.351
I'm sorry. Garfield, not now.

43:25.769 --> 43:30.106
I upped the reward to... $200 and
I'm gonna put up some more posters to...

43:30.190 --> 43:33.359
He's clog dancing, I think,
wearing lederhosen.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.654
- I'm sorry. Garfield, not now.
- You're gonna miss it.

43:36.739 --> 43:40.617
I'm sorry, Liz. I'll call you later.
Garfield's being... Garfield.

43:40.701 --> 43:46.289
Do I have to bark like Lassie? Come on,
humor me, would you? Arf, arf, arf.

43:46.373 --> 43:50.627
Quickly. While we're young.
Today. Let's go.

43:51.086 --> 43:52.545
Be happy.

43:52.880 --> 43:58.551
You're gonna miss this. He's the small
one, the small one in the guy's hand.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.011
Garfield...

44:00.095 --> 44:02.930
I'm not in the mood.

44:03.057 --> 44:06.267
You know, it's never good
when you turn off my TV,

44:06.393 --> 44:08.394
and this may be the worst ever.

44:09.730 --> 44:14.859
Odie's not ready. He's months
of reinforcement away from consistency.

44:21.075 --> 44:25.912
Happy, you promised you'd never use that.
That collar is inhumane.

44:26.413 --> 44:31.334
This collar is the dog's future.

44:32.419 --> 44:35.505
Do you have a problem with that?

44:35.589 --> 44:37.674
- No.
- No?

44:37.758 --> 44:41.594
Now we'll see how smart you really are.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.767
Happy Chapman. Happy Chapman. Happy...

44:47.851 --> 44:50.061
Not now, Garfield.

44:50.145 --> 44:53.398
Jon, you're... denser than ever.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.650
I gotta think outside the box.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.819
Hey, the box.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.987
Wait a second.

45:01.532 --> 45:05.326
My box... my box had something on it.

45:05.452 --> 45:09.997
Let's see. Apple Jacks. Frosted Flakes.
Cocoa Puffs. Kibbly Kat.

45:10.124 --> 45:13.626
Yes. There it is. Telegraph Tower.

45:13.836 --> 45:17.964
That's where they make
The Happy Chapman Show. Yeah.

45:18.298 --> 45:24.220
But how far away can that be?
Maybe... a paw? Paw and a half, maybe?

45:24.304 --> 45:26.389
This is a done deal. I can do this!

45:28.642 --> 45:31.352
No, can't do this.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.563
Reached physical limits.

45:33.647 --> 45:36.858
Shouldn't have tried it without snacks.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.985
Must go back and reload.

45:51.665 --> 45:53.875
And that's a sign that the tank is full.

45:54.418 --> 45:58.963
I can do this. Beyond this intersection
is just another intersection.

45:59.047 --> 46:04.051
And another. And then another. I wonder
if there's any meat loaf left in the fridge.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.721
No. Now's not the time
for a plate of meat loaf.

46:06.805 --> 46:09.265
Now's the time for a plate of courage.

46:09.349 --> 46:14.604
Ladies and gentlemen,
Garfield has left the cul-de-sac.

46:21.862 --> 46:26.324
He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

46:30.537 --> 46:33.915
Now, that's more my style.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.500
Oh, taxi.

46:36.168 --> 46:38.711
Step on it, will you, driver?

46:44.426 --> 46:47.261
No, Odie's not a hound dog.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.846
Yes, I'm sure.

46:48.931 --> 46:52.892
No, I don't want another dog.
Thanks, anyway.

46:53.018 --> 46:55.144
Garfield, lunchtime.

46:56.813 --> 46:59.649
I made your favorite, lasagne.

47:03.695 --> 47:05.780
Garfield!

47:06.865 --> 47:08.950
Garfield!

47:09.868 --> 47:11.786
Garfield, where are you?

47:16.375 --> 47:22.046
Can anyone direct me to the pink building
that's shown on the Kibbly Kat box?

47:23.090 --> 47:26.300
It's the one right by the
blue and orange tree.

47:27.219 --> 47:31.389
Well, this doesn't feel pink building-ish.

47:33.725 --> 47:36.102
Hello? Hello? Uh-oh.

47:36.353 --> 47:40.314
Rats? Rats the size of... rats.

47:42.484 --> 47:45.111
Why am I being surrounded here?

47:45.195 --> 47:47.905
Some of my best friends are vermin.

47:47.990 --> 47:51.701
- Finally, some meat.
- Meat? No, it's not meat.

47:51.910 --> 47:55.997
They measured it - it's 100 per cent
body fat, no nutritional value.

47:56.081 --> 47:59.417
- Body fat's good with us.
- Mmm.

47:59.501 --> 48:01.085
- Garfield.
- Louis.

48:01.169 --> 48:03.087
What's going on here?

48:03.255 --> 48:06.966
- Louis, I got 3,000 teeny mouths to feed.
- Back off.

48:07.050 --> 48:10.595
- Garfield? What are you doing here?
- Besides defending my life?

48:10.929 --> 48:15.099
Jon got a dog. Dog got kidnapped
by a TV star. I'm trying to rescue him.

48:15.183 --> 48:17.435
Seems like you got yourself in a jam.

48:17.519 --> 48:19.395
Wish there was something
I could do to help.

48:19.479 --> 48:22.690
Louis, I think you and I have
an account still. Remember?

48:22.774 --> 48:25.776
- Macadamia-nut cookies?
- I do love the macadamia.

48:26.194 --> 48:31.282
Sorry, rat pack, this cat's with me.
Y'all gotta roll. Go ahead, roll out.

48:31.366 --> 48:34.285
Who wants to go to the Red Lobster alley?

48:34.870 --> 48:39.040
Maybe next time, little critters. Good luck
with the plague and rabies and everything.

48:39.124 --> 48:42.293
Don't push your luck, fat cat.

48:42.669 --> 48:45.296
You can't just be wandering
around the city.

48:45.380 --> 48:50.468
There are dangers everywhere.
Pot holes. Subways. Animal control.

48:50.552 --> 48:52.803
Can you get me to Telegraph Tower?

48:52.888 --> 48:56.307
Two more cookies and you got a deal.
But keep it on the down low.

48:56.475 --> 48:58.309
How "down low" do we have to go?

48:59.186 --> 49:03.773
- Yo, Garfield, you with me?
- This is a little bit lower than I expected.

49:03.857 --> 49:06.817
If I didn't have a box over my head
I'd be humiliated.

49:08.528 --> 49:12.031
OK. Hold up. All right, we're almost there.

49:12.449 --> 49:15.284
When I give you the signal,
we gotta cross the street.

49:15.369 --> 49:19.580
- Way over there, by the horizon?
- Come on, Garfield, let's go.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.582
Wait up! Wait up.

49:26.838 --> 49:28.381
Am I dead?

49:28.465 --> 49:32.593
- Garfield, don't move.
- Don't move? Not a problem.

49:32.678 --> 49:35.763
Just wait for the walk signal.

49:36.598 --> 49:40.476
Oh, no. It's a stampede. Stampede!

49:40.560 --> 49:44.313
- If I could just get away from this herd.
- Garfield!

49:44.398 --> 49:46.357
Garfield!

49:46.441 --> 49:49.568
Garfield, where are you?

49:49.653 --> 49:53.656
- Garfield, get down from there, man.
- No, I'm not coming down.

49:53.740 --> 49:56.784
I'm happy to live the rest of my life
up here. Thank you.

50:01.790 --> 50:04.500
Liz! Liz.

50:04.584 --> 50:07.128
- What's wrong?
- Garfield's run away.

50:07.212 --> 50:10.339
First Odie, now Garfield.
I am the worst pet owner ever.

50:10.424 --> 50:12.633
- What happened?
- I can't find him.

50:12.718 --> 50:14.510
I can't live without Garfield.

50:14.594 --> 50:16.887
Let's start at the park.

50:17.472 --> 50:20.307
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

50:20.392 --> 50:22.810
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

50:22.894 --> 50:25.771
Garfield, relax. Look, we're here.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.441
- We're here now?
- Curb service.

50:28.525 --> 50:32.069
The Telegraph Tower in all its splendor.

50:35.240 --> 50:39.535
- It looks smaller on the box.
- You gotta go all the way up there?

50:39.619 --> 50:43.038
Good luck. I'll catch you later.
I don't do the vertical thing.

50:43.123 --> 50:45.374
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- Hold up, G.

50:45.459 --> 50:47.793
- What?
- Watch out for the po-po.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.463
- You know, five-oh. Control-oh.
- Huh?

50:50.547 --> 50:53.758
- Animal control, man.
- Oh, that po-po.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.218
- Keep it squeal.
- OK. Thanks, partner.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.679
Oink, oink.

50:58.764 --> 51:03.267
I can't try the door.
I couldn't handle another stampede.

51:08.565 --> 51:09.774
Hey.

51:12.861 --> 51:15.029
First thing Monday morning,

51:15.113 --> 51:19.909
I'm gonna get to work
on losing those last... 20 pounds.

51:24.247 --> 51:27.583
OK. Everything looks good out there.

51:27.667 --> 51:31.420
Looks like we got ourselves a blockage.

51:38.303 --> 51:41.388
Guess we'll just purge the system.

51:51.733 --> 51:55.361
Pardon me.
That wasn't my stomach, was it?

51:56.738 --> 51:59.448
There's a cooling breeze.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.252
Weeeee.

52:19.177 --> 52:20.594
Oh!

52:20.679 --> 52:22.763
My poor nose.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.059
Jon, stop the car.

52:32.774 --> 52:34.900
- What?
- It's Odie.

52:34.985 --> 52:38.028
Somebody found him. 52903 Euclid Street.

52:38.113 --> 52:40.322
Let's go.

52:41.366 --> 52:45.536
Odie! Odie.

52:46.913 --> 52:51.750
Odster. Od-man.

52:52.210 --> 52:56.547
This rescue thing is exhausting.
When do heroes get to eat?

52:57.591 --> 53:00.467
Oh, my! It's Odie.

53:04.222 --> 53:07.850
O- o-o-o-o-o-o-die!

53:07.934 --> 53:12.313
I found you.
I'm so sorry I got you into this mess.

53:12.397 --> 53:14.857
Look, we kinda got off on the wrong paw,

53:14.941 --> 53:20.112
but you can be really annoying sometimes
and you don't give me enough space.

53:20.196 --> 53:22.531
And you're a major-league suck-up.

53:22.616 --> 53:26.952
But we have a common purpose,
we share Jon.

53:27.037 --> 53:32.291
Jon needs us even more.
And I kinda want you back home too.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.294
So stand back.

53:35.378 --> 53:37.129
I almost got...

53:37.213 --> 53:41.884
Hurry up, Wendell.
Fortune waits for no man.

53:44.179 --> 53:49.642
- You think he's ready for the audition?
- Well, why don't you see for yourself?

53:49.935 --> 53:52.728
Come on, Odie. Show time.

53:54.856 --> 53:57.107
Now...

53:57.192 --> 53:58.692
Ah.

53:58.777 --> 54:02.696
Good morning, New York.
I know you're gonna flip for Odie because...

54:02.781 --> 54:04.907
he sure is flipping for you.

54:07.953 --> 54:10.704
- Ride 'em, cowboy.
- A shock collar?

54:10.789 --> 54:13.332
That's... that's inhumane.

54:13.416 --> 54:16.335
Oh, gosh. Hot doggie.

54:16.419 --> 54:20.255
So, when does our train leave?

54:20.507 --> 54:23.175
- Two hours.
- Tickets?

54:23.259 --> 54:25.344
Chop chop.

54:27.472 --> 54:29.181
Poor Odie.

54:29.265 --> 54:34.311
He faces a future of torture,
neglect and degradation.

54:34.437 --> 54:37.606
Nobody gets to mistreat
my dog like that except me.

54:42.904 --> 54:43.988
Psst.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.616
I'll be right behind you, little buddy.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.340
Surf's up.

55:03.425 --> 55:07.094
Gravity, do your th-i-i-i-i-ng!

55:17.272 --> 55:18.772
Whoa.

55:18.857 --> 55:21.108
Housekeeping at 12 o'clock!

55:21.192 --> 55:22.484
Whoa!

55:22.569 --> 55:26.488
You know, I think I had
a nightmare like this once.

55:41.254 --> 55:46.592
Once again my life has been saved
by the miracle of lasagne.

55:47.052 --> 55:51.055
I said limo, not taxi.
Do you know the difference?

55:51.139 --> 55:53.223
Odie! Here I come.

55:53.308 --> 55:56.101
Don't worry, fella. I'll rescue you.

55:56.603 --> 55:59.688
- Halt! Got you!
- Whoa! Huh?

55:59.773 --> 56:02.066
Well, what have we got here?

56:02.275 --> 56:05.110
Looks like we got us a cat with no tags.

56:05.195 --> 56:09.698
McGillicuddy, there's an animal
felony happening right behind you.

56:09.783 --> 56:12.910
I'm trying to do some
rescue work here, pal.

56:14.579 --> 56:18.123
- Welcome to my world.
- I'm gonna call somebody.

56:18.208 --> 56:24.046
This is police brutality. I have tags.
I just left them in my other fur.

56:24.130 --> 56:26.215
This is abusive, now. This is abuse.

56:26.299 --> 56:28.967
- In you go, big fella.
- Huh?

56:29.052 --> 56:32.429
- What is with the cage?
- OK. Lock it down.

56:32.806 --> 56:36.600
Now, this is is insulting.
You know I'm house-trained.

56:36.768 --> 56:41.021
- Settle down, people.
- I ought to give you a bunch of fives, pal.

56:41.106 --> 56:43.941
This is all a terrible mistake.

56:44.025 --> 56:48.946
I was trying to save a friend
that's not very smart, needed my help.

56:49.030 --> 56:53.617
I don't belong in here.
I have an owner. I'm not a stray.

56:54.702 --> 56:56.745
- Hi. I'm Jon Arbuckle.
- Hi.

56:56.830 --> 57:00.582
- I think you have my dog Odie.
- I think you're mistaken.

57:00.667 --> 57:05.295
- No. I saw the flyer. Odie's my dog.
- No. He's Happy Chapman's dog.

57:05.505 --> 57:08.132
Happy Chapman?

57:08.633 --> 57:12.219
The gentleman with the cat on Channel 37.

57:12.303 --> 57:14.930
He came and took Odie home.

57:15.682 --> 57:19.393
"Odie" is a family name, you know.

57:19.477 --> 57:21.895
- Well, good day.
- Wait a min...

57:23.481 --> 57:27.276
Happy Chapman took Odie?
Think he's got Garfield too?

57:27.360 --> 57:30.320
I don't know. But we're gonna find out.

57:31.114 --> 57:35.951
Swing low, sweet chariot

57:36.035 --> 57:38.453
Shut up!

57:39.497 --> 57:44.960
Coming for to carry me home

57:45.044 --> 57:47.504
Could you please be quiet?

57:47.589 --> 57:51.216
Guard, guard. This really is too much.

57:51.384 --> 57:55.971
Persnikitty, Happy Chapman's cat,
what are you doing in here?

57:56.055 --> 58:00.767
I was his cat, until I outlived my purpose.

58:00.852 --> 58:05.022
Then he replaced me with a dog
and dumped me in this wretched place.

58:05.231 --> 58:10.402
- All humans are the same.
- Not Jon, my owner. No way.

58:10.528 --> 58:14.448
He only does what's best for me.
He puts up with me and he feeds me.

58:14.532 --> 58:17.576
And lets you vacation
in this charming pound. Hello.

58:18.077 --> 58:21.580
- Not for long, Persnikitty.
- Would you just stop calling me that?

58:21.664 --> 58:24.291
My name isn't really Persnikitty.

58:24.375 --> 58:27.002
- It's Sir Roland.
- Sir Roland?

58:27.086 --> 58:30.088
Yes. Another one
of Happy Chapman's acts of cruelty.

58:30.173 --> 58:32.841
I was trained in the classical theater.
Uh-huh.

58:32.926 --> 58:39.181
But now I'm a celebrity cable cast-off cat,
with a name I can never live down.

58:39.265 --> 58:44.353
This may hurt a little. I'm trying to rescue
the dog that replaced you, Persnikitty.

58:44.437 --> 58:48.690
I mean, Roland. Happy and Odie are
getting on a train in less than two hours

58:48.816 --> 58:51.652
to become regulars
on Good Day New York.

58:51.736 --> 58:54.905
Wait a minute. Did I just hear that right?

58:55.114 --> 58:58.492
You're a cat that's trying to rescue a dog?

58:58.576 --> 59:01.703
It true. I know, it's a crime against nature.

59:02.163 --> 59:05.415
At first I thought he was a pain,
but he's grown on me,

59:05.500 --> 59:08.543
like a wart you want to have removed
until you realize

59:08.628 --> 59:11.004
it defines you in some funny way.

59:11.798 --> 59:14.299
Do you know, that is absolutely charming?

59:14.592 --> 59:19.221
Let me ask you a question, chubby.
What are you talking about?

59:19.305 --> 59:23.183
How could you understand?
He's my friend.

59:23.268 --> 59:26.144
My gosh. How low have I sunk?

59:26.229 --> 59:29.314
Guard, may I have some shoelaces, please?

59:30.275 --> 59:34.027
Well, hello there.
Right on time. Nice to see you.

59:34.112 --> 59:37.239
I need a five-cat line-up right now.
Move, move, move.

59:37.490 --> 59:39.574
- What's going on?
- Adoption.

59:39.659 --> 59:41.285
One of us is getting out of here.

59:41.369 --> 59:45.872
So, you're here to look at a cat.
Let's see if we can't take care of it.

59:45.957 --> 59:47.165
Careful.

59:47.375 --> 59:50.961
- Let's go. Let's hurry it up.
- Your hands are freezing.

59:51.045 --> 59:55.173
Come on, you newbie.
This might be your lucky day.

59:55.258 --> 59:59.594
Come on. There you go.
Oh! You are a heavy one.

59:59.679 --> 01:00:04.182
Excuse me, muscle weighs
more than fat. Check this.

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:08.020
There you go.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:13.317
All right, slide it up.
Paws on the white line. Tails in the air.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:17.571
I don't need to be adopted, guys.
My guy Jon is coming to get me, I'm sure.

01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:19.448
- That one.
- Really.

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:23.577
She picked me! She picked me.
She did. She picked me. She picked me.

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:28.290
Not that one. That one.
The one that looks like the cat on TV.

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:30.792
Back it up, Red. She went with Trigger.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.545
Sorry, love. Better luck next time.

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:35.964
Now, you be careful.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.342
That's sore. Ow!

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.260
Jon's gonna be here in five minutes.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.845
When I give the signal,

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:43.847
- run like a mad cow.
- What?

01:00:43.931 --> 01:00:46.308
- Don't you want to save your friend?
- Run?

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:47.768
Now!

01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:50.437
Eat hairball, Happy Chapman.

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:52.647
Not the red button.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:57.611
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.659
Go, go, go. The door!

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:07.245
Run, run. Go, go. Get the door.

01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:14.211
- Wait. There's a fire hydrant.
- Don't stop! Don't stop!

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.678
Code blue, code blue. We got runners.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:27.641
Halt! Stop!
You have not been cleared for release.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:01.425
- Garfield's been here.
- Excuse me, can I help you guys?

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:05.720
- We're looking for Happy Chapman.
- He's on his way to the train station.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:09.933
Do you guys have a pass, or something?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.143
Thanks.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:18.483
Excuse me.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.485
Your attention, please.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:26.700
The New Amsterdam Limited
is now boarding on platform 12.

01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:29.786
All aboard!

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:32.706
All aboard!

01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:43.049
Good afternoon, gentlemen. What will
you be having? Salmon, steak or lasagne?

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:46.136
Steak. I hate lasagne.

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:50.932
Beep beep. Cat coming through.
Beep beep. Going through the tunnel.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.185
- A cat!
- I just had to do that.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.646
Final call for
the New Amsterdam Limited.

01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:02.319
The New Amsterdam Limited
is now departing from platform 12.

01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:05.572
No. Wait, please. Stop.

01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:09.075
Wait. Don't... No. Oh!

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.411
You monster, Chapman.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:16.082
I can't outrun a train. Whoa.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:19.044
Watch the train, pal.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:20.504
Hey.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:24.549
I got it. It's just a train set, only bigger.

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:30.597
- Oh, no. We're too late.
- No. We're gonna stop that train.

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.516
Come on.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:39.606
Somewhere around here there's gotta
be a big table with all the trains on it.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.157
He looks like the type.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:53.662
And this must be where
he's got his little table.

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:58.250
I'm sorry.
There's no way to stop that train.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.919
You don't understand.
You have to stop that train.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.712
My dog and my cat are on that train.

01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:07.425
I suppose if Jon can do this, I can.

01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:15.850
OK. We gotta find our train.
Let's see what happens when I do this.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.022
Boston express, switching to...

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:25.402
Well, I'm sorry. Folks in Boston
are gonna be a little late today.

01:04:26.153 --> 01:04:27.737
Ah.

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:31.658
Let's see what happens when I do this.

01:04:31.742 --> 01:04:36.371
- Warning, Seattle Wind...
- I don't care about Seattle.

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.206
Warning. Collision...

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.001
I'm looking for one train in particular.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:44.045
Just one second,
I'm trying to find my friend.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:48.133
- The New Amsterdam...
- There's the Amsterdam.

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.721
Warning. Collision 20 seconds.

01:04:52.805 --> 01:04:54.180
Gosh, you sound like my mother.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:59.436
- Hold up. Everybody stop.
- Ten seconds. Warning.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:06.109
- Five. Four.
- Stop what you're doing.

01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:08.778
- Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
- All stop.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:18.747
Yeah! OK, everybody,
let's take it from the top. OK?

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:24.461
- You have to stop that train.
- Hold on.

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:29.799
I'll be down to meet you
at the station, Odie.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:34.429
Actually, that train has stopped.
It's returning to the station.

01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:38.350
Are we on the right train?

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.443
Where are ya?

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.823
I think I recognize that whine.

01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:00.789
Hey, come on.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:06.836
See, these are the kinds of seats you get
when you book at the last minute.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:10.965
Good to see you, partner.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.390
- Let's get out of here.
- Your attention, please.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:23.520
The New Amsterdam Limited is making
an unscheduled stop on platform 12.

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:29.192
- Sir, please take your seat.
- My future is running away from me.

01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:36.282
Please, stay calm.
Go back to your seats.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:03.476
Would you slow down? I've been doing
this running thing all day and I am over it.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:06.312
We're... we're safe now. We're free.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:09.357
Oh, if it isn't "Unhappy Chappy".

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:11.818
Going somewhere?

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:16.364
Nice accessory.
But I don't want to play dress-up with you.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:18.825
Let's get out of here. Let's beat it.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.415
No! Right in the nose again!

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.918
So it's gonna get physical, is it?

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:33.047
Did you really think you could
just run away from Happy Chapman?

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:36.301
- Is this a cry for help!
- No dumb dirty animal

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:39.095
is ever gonna get the better of me.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:43.808
Let's see how you feel with 200 volts
coursing through your thick canine skull.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.226
- Chapman.
- Come here.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:49.189
Get your hands off of my friend!

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:58.573
Hey. What round is it?

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:01.075
- Good to see you.
- We're here to help.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.286
- Sir Roland?
- In the fur.

01:08:04.955 --> 01:08:06.456
Come on, come on, come on.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.399
Rats! Agh!

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:42.116
Here's the drill. Cats, scratch
like you've never scratched before.

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:44.368
Dogs, bite but don't chew. And rats?

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:48.497
See if you can get that pretty
necklace around his neck.

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:55.087
Canines, felines and vermines,

01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:57.881
it's show time.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:07.058
Thanks, boys.
The home team will take it from here.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.644
Better split
before animal control gets here.

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:12.522
- Garfield, shake it easy.
- See you later.

01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:18.278
Odie, would you mind
sharing the remote, please?

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:23.950
Every dog has his day, Happy.

01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:28.078
- Nice kitty.
- Let's see what's on the news.

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:38.131
Let me tell you something. To you, Odie
might be just a dumb, stupid, smelly dog.

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:41.134
But to me, he's all that and much more.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.638
He's my friend.

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:49.183
Odie, try something else.
Maybe there's a game on.

01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:58.526
Strong finish, little buddy.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.737
Odie? Garfield?

01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:02.906
- Odie?
- Odie?

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.782
Odie?

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:10.079
- Be happy.
- This is for stealing my dog and my cat.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.752
He didn't steal me.
I was doing the rescue work.

01:10:15.836 --> 01:10:17.670
Garfield. Odie.

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:20.006
- Come here.
- Come here.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:23.801
I missed you guys so much.
I was so worried about you.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:29.307
Never gonna let you out of my sight again.
Never. You guys are my best friends.

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:31.809
You had me at hello.

01:10:34.688 --> 01:10:38.149
This is Walter J. Chapman,
with breaking news from the Midwest.

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:41.194
Abby Shields reporting.
What you got for me, Abby?

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:47.116
It appears that a deranged man
may be the cause of all the trouble here.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.786
A deranged man? What is this?

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:53.623
In fact, the police are bringing
the suspect out as we speak.

01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:55.750
Good grief, it's my idiot brother.

01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:58.628
That's Happy Chapman.

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.756
He's going for a ride in the police car.

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:06.094
Sources tell me that
this incident somehow involved a dog

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:08.262
and a very heroic cat.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:12.100
- Garfield?
- He saved Odie.

01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:15.061
- Now he's a hero.
- I didn't realize.

01:11:15.145 --> 01:11:17.522
Garfield's on TV. He's a hero!

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:24.028
Garfield. That's Garfield.
Garfield's a hero now.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:27.281
Thanks, everybody.
Thanks for saying that.

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:31.619
We're a whole street
full of heroes. Yeah.

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.247
Heroes!

01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:38.668
Yeah. Whoa! Hey, Arlene.

01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:41.713
Well, it's nice to be recognized
by your peers.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:45.633
I couldn't have done this without you. I...

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:52.098
- You're a really great friend.
- Jon,

01:11:52.182 --> 01:11:55.727
I want to be more than your friend.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.187
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:04.902
Where do they find the energy?

01:12:22.796 --> 01:12:27.550
Yeah. Just one big happy family.

01:12:27.634 --> 01:12:29.677
Yeah, right!

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.846
Hit the floor.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:37.143
No. Seriously, you can come up, buddy.
Come on. No, seriously, come on up.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:42.690
Down you go. We just hit it off so great
because we both love the same thing.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.943
And that is... me.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.614
I feeI good

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.741
I knew that I would, now

01:12:51.825 --> 01:12:53.117
Oh, yeah. Hagh!

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:56.329
I feeI good

01:12:56.413 --> 01:13:00.166
I knew that I would, now

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.834
So good

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:05.046
So good, I got you

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.424
So good

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:11.636
So good, I got you

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.763
Yeah. Heugh!

01:13:13.847 --> 01:13:16.307
Oh.

01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:19.227
Hey! Huh!

01:13:21.438 --> 01:13:22.814
Uh...

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:23.940
Oops!

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:26.109
Hey, Odie.

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:30.238
Help me, I can't get up.

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:34.742
Odie, my friend, bring me some ice.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:38.538
Will you hurry up, you dumb dog?
I'm in pain.

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:10.387
English - US
