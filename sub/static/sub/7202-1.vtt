00:31.532 --> 00:35.134
Midgard rejects
your frozen villainy, ymir,

00:35.136 --> 00:37.002
ice giant of niffleheim.

00:37.004 --> 00:40.372
The ice will silence you,
Thor odinson.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.776
Yeah. Less talk,
more rock, goldilocks.

00:48.049 --> 00:51.316
Speak not to me
of battle tactics, hulk.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.252
I have fought more...

00:53.254 --> 00:56.588
Here's my question:
Why is an ice giant
on monuriki island?

00:56.590 --> 01:00.926
I mean, it's not really
an ice-friendly location,
like, say, someplace cold.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.066
By the way,
ice is the perfect weapon

01:07.068 --> 01:09.268
because it melts
and leaves no evidence.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.904
Saw that in a movie,
i think.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.876
What was that movie?

01:17.878 --> 01:19.678
Cap, you know
what I'm talking about.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.280
Stay on task,
iron man.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.515
We need to find that casket
before it's opened.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.851
Eternal winter in a box?
Nope, not seeing it.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.586
Would long summer
on a stick work?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.788
Ymir and the casket
of ancient winters

01:29.790 --> 01:32.591
are as powerful
as they are old, iron man.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.626
<i> Trifle with them</i>
<i> at your peril.</i>

01:34.628 --> 01:37.763
I'm not trifling, hammer-time.
I'm judging.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.698
Glacier-to-go may be big,
strong,

01:39.700 --> 01:41.700
and handy
when the fridge breaks,

01:41.702 --> 01:43.969
but even popsicles know
to stay in the shade.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.371
So why is he here?
And how did he get here?

01:46.373 --> 01:49.074
I don't know.
This doesn't add up.
Something's off.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.447
And you're off to join it.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.951
<i> Whoa! Iron man</i>
<i> just became iron rocket!</i>

01:58.953 --> 02:01.954
Is he okay? Should I tag in?
'Cause I can tag in.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.589
Negative, reptil.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.124
You're here to observe
as a trainee.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.126
That's what you do
on a ride-along.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.061
<i> Technically,</i>
<i> it's more of a fly-along.</i>

02:09.062 --> 02:11.163
And I can just
power dive into a--

02:11.165 --> 02:13.132
do not engage, reptil.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.400
Check on the boats out there.
That's an order.

02:15.402 --> 02:18.137
Boats. Yes, sir.

02:22.309 --> 02:26.178
Don't go too far, kid.
We're about to wrap this up.

02:28.582 --> 02:32.117
<i> Cap, I have a visual</i>
<i> on the casket.</i>
<i> It's in permafrosty's hand.</i>

02:32.119 --> 02:35.420
You make him drop it,
captain marvel.
I'll recover it.

02:35.422 --> 02:38.657
Operation fumble is a go.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.360
Time to make some ice scream.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.769
Get it?
It's a play on words.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.972
Not bad, hulk.
I mean, for you.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.542
Snowball, corner pocket.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.890
Who do you...

03:23.904 --> 03:28.240
What did I do during
the best ice monster
beach brawl ever?

03:28.242 --> 03:30.175
Boat check.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.411
Wait. That looks like...

03:32.413 --> 03:34.213
Loki.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.216
Guys, it's reptil.
I think I just spotted--

03:37.218 --> 03:39.151
<i> a little busy right now, son.</i>

03:40.221 --> 03:43.589
I know, but you've
really gotta hear this.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.791
About to lose ya.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.564
Well, he did say,
"check on the boats,"
so...

03:52.566 --> 03:54.800
Tagging in!

03:57.371 --> 03:59.504
Drop the scepter, loki.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.941
"Drop the scepter, loki,"
or what?

04:02.943 --> 04:07.279
Or I'll-- I, uh...

04:07.281 --> 04:08.947
Just drop it.

04:08.949 --> 04:12.084
It's a fair question,
childasaurus.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.087
Perhaps you should return
when you can answer it.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.723
It's over, loki,
one way or the other.

04:17.725 --> 04:21.627
Yes, even the best-laid plans
of immortals go awry,

04:21.629 --> 04:23.595
thanks to your friends.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.597
At least we can
agree on that!

04:42.283 --> 04:45.050
Hole in the sky!

04:47.421 --> 04:50.956
I'm trying to remember
all the positives
of a big hole in the sky.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.291
Nope. There are none.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.661
Okay, cap.
Got a plan for this nightmare?

04:55.663 --> 04:58.163
<i> Cap? Cap?</i>

05:07.308 --> 05:08.707
Aah!

05:13.947 --> 05:15.814
Where are you,
pesky flea?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.283
You can't hide.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.265
Enough ice follies.

05:33.267 --> 05:36.368
Need to secure the casket,
and the kid.

05:43.344 --> 05:48.613
Well, I'm afraid this is where
you and I part ways, pre-hero.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.849
I, to a new beginning,

05:50.851 --> 05:54.019
and you, to oblivion.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.901
Whoa! I'll tag out now.
Anybody want in? No?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.776
Wait. I can fly.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.182
I can out-flap this skynado,
no problem.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.985
Is there any way to do this
without hugging?

06:26.987 --> 06:28.987
This hug
is saving your life.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.757
Then I'd rather perish.
As would I.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.925
Stop complaining
and hug for your life!

06:37.231 --> 06:39.965
There it is.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.934
Okay, I've got the casket.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.404
Now let's focus on...

06:45.406 --> 06:47.606
A much bigger problem.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.040
Whoa.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.411
Incoming, me!
Gotcha!

06:52.413 --> 06:55.180
Oh, hey, cap.
Mystical vortex troubles?

06:55.182 --> 06:57.716
Funny, we were just
discussing that very topic.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.718
Hulk has
an interesting theory.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.859
No-o-o-o!

07:07.861 --> 07:11.096
Had enough, skynado?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.781
Reptil!
He's out cold.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.117
Don't worry.
I got this. Kid!

07:32.119 --> 07:34.386
Wake up! Yeah, no good.

07:34.388 --> 07:35.921
Hey, hulk,
how about a little help?

07:35.923 --> 07:38.290
Wake u-u-up!

07:38.292 --> 07:39.791
Was that hulk?

07:39.793 --> 07:43.395
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

07:44.465 --> 07:47.632
Hey, check it out.
I'm still alive.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.302
Yeah!
We did it!

07:50.304 --> 07:52.771
And I just invented
dino-boarding.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.808
Uh-oh.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.644
And dino-crashing.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.181
And full-body dino-trauma.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.220
Reptil, you alive?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.361
For my encore, I will pass out.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.202
The metal one spoke truth.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.038
The island's warmth
made me weak.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.841
It was a poor plan.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.378
It was you that failed,
not my plan.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.280
You were to open
the casket of ancient winters

08:36.283 --> 08:39.683
in a remote location
so as to avoid detection.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.020
Instead,
it was a wasted trip.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.188
The meddlers were fortunate.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.292
That may be, but Thor
delivers the casket

08:47.294 --> 08:50.328
to asgard for safekeeping
as we speak.

08:50.330 --> 08:55.634
Our new path to conquest
must crush all heroic obstacles.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.869
I know a way.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.540
You have an idea?
How refreshing.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.445
Apologies, lord of ice.
Please continue.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.753
I tell the tale of jolnir.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.989
Oh, stop.
I've heard this tale.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.559
Jolnir is a silly legend.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.695
His kind and generous
winter antics
are a fairy tale

09:23.697 --> 09:27.866
to amuse asgardian children
and gullible frost giants.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.404
It's utter nonsense.

09:32.406 --> 09:36.908
No. Jolnir is nearly
as ancient as I am,

09:36.910 --> 09:39.644
and just as real.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.250
<i> Part frost giant, part elf,</i>

09:45.252 --> 09:49.321
<i> jolnir was born</i>
<i> with immense power.</i>

09:50.591 --> 09:54.426
<i> But instead of using</i>
<i> that power to rule,</i>

09:54.428 --> 09:56.761
<i> he squandered it</i>
<i> on helping those</i>

09:56.763 --> 10:00.098
<i> too young and weak</i>
<i> to help themselves--</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:03.201
<i> children.</i>

10:03.203 --> 10:06.605
<i> Today, jolnir</i>
<i> is better known</i>

10:06.607 --> 10:08.273
<i> as Santa claus.</i>

10:08.275 --> 10:10.909
<i> And each winter,</i>
<i> he brings gifts </i>

10:10.911 --> 10:13.945
<i> to all the children</i>
<i> of the nine worlds </i>
ho ho ho ho ho ho!

10:13.947 --> 10:16.348
<i> In one night.</i>

10:17.451 --> 10:20.785
Such a monumental feat
is impossible

10:20.787 --> 10:23.188
to all but him.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.124
Such power.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.794
And if we
could harness that power,

10:29.796 --> 10:33.565
none on earth could resist.

10:33.567 --> 10:38.303
Yes, I am well aware
of Santa claus.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.973
Santa claus is beloved,
celebrated.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.143
Songs are sung in his name.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.946
Hmm? Using him to dominate

10:47.948 --> 10:51.182
the very beings
that adore him...

10:51.184 --> 10:54.986
Well, that is just
too devious to resist.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.823
I guess there's more to you
than snow and ice,
after all, ymir.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.358
But where will we find him?

11:00.360 --> 11:05.096
If the stories are true,
he makes his home in alfheim,

11:05.098 --> 11:07.165
home of the light elves.

11:07.167 --> 11:11.136
Ugh, elves. Of course.
I should've known.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.638
But if he's as powerful
as you say,

11:13.640 --> 11:16.675
how could we
usurp that power?

11:16.677 --> 11:19.044
We lost one casket.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.513
But there is another--

11:21.515 --> 11:24.182
the casket of ancient powers.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.218
It can transfer
even the greatest abilities

11:27.220 --> 11:30.388
from one being to another.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.792
And, like jolnir,

11:33.794 --> 11:36.494
it too resides in alfheim.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.899
A new path.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.701
Misinformation and a reward

11:42.703 --> 11:45.236
should flush jolnir
into the open

11:45.238 --> 11:48.206
while we seek the casket
of ancient powers.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.542
If no one else finds him,
we will.

11:50.544 --> 11:54.245
And then we will
claim his power.

11:54.247 --> 12:00.018
Yes. The hunt is on
for Santa claus.

12:07.327 --> 12:12.464
But first, a distraction
for our heroic friends.

12:34.621 --> 12:35.820
Huh?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.830
Hm. You'll do.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.775
Remember your footwork.
Again.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.217
Again.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.629
Am I still in trouble
for going after loki on my own?

13:17.631 --> 13:21.733
You're not in trouble.
You're in training
to join this team someday.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.169
And that won't happen
if you don't learn teamwork.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.172
I tried to tell you.
I just...

13:27.174 --> 13:29.440
I wanted you
to believe in me.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.977
I figured if I catch loki--
boom, I'm in the game.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.281
But you don't act alone
when you're part of a team.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.950
So you're on the bench.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.486
Going a little hard on him,
aren't you?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.855
He showed guts.
Guts count too.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.024
Only when they're paired
with brains.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.828
Aw, lighten up, cap.
He stepped up to loki,
and he's still here.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.763
Gold star for that.

13:51.765 --> 13:54.165
Did young cap
take no for an answer?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.434
Did young any of us?
No.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.636
And we all made mistakes.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.839
Mistakes I'm trying
to help him avoid.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.174
He'll learn
from the mistakes.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.876
We did.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.012
- Uh, guys? I'm right here.
- He'll be fine.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.848
He's a one-man dino-band.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.183
You know who else
had skills like that?
Dinosaurs.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.353
And look how things
turned out for them.
Wait. Bad example.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.456
I rest my case.
Guys, still in the room.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.960
You wouldn't worry so much
if you had
my new-car shine, cap.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.829
Now pipe down
before the kid hears us.

14:24.831 --> 14:28.132
Whoa!
Thor's back already?
That was quick.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.034
No. He said
it would take time

14:30.036 --> 14:33.071
to secure
the casket of ancient winters
in asgard.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.240
That was something else.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.678
Tell me you didn't use
my private bathroom again.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.882
I like your shampoo.
Smells like candy canes.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.551
Candy? Hulk,
that's not shampoo.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.888
That's foot cream. Ugh.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.890
I still like it.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.726
Should I come?

14:54.728 --> 14:56.895
Guys?

15:10.777 --> 15:13.378
Tourist?
He doesn't look local.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.080
No, but he's making
himself at home.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.918
Not in my house.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.921
Nobody makes a mess
in my house.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.923
Except you.

15:24.925 --> 15:28.192
Easy, hulk. First priority
is clearing the street.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.361
Get everyone
out of the lizard zone.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.531
I'm on it.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.201
Don't worry about the Fender.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.937
I got that covered.

15:53.386 --> 15:57.021
You're welcome.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.292
Really? Rampages
make us all look bad,

16:01.294 --> 16:03.962
extra-large dino-noob.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.433
Heads up!

16:08.435 --> 16:10.802
You do need to work
on your reflexes.

16:10.804 --> 16:11.803
Thanks!

16:11.805 --> 16:14.806
You wanna walk away
or fly away.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.642
The flying option
involves punching.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.982
Have a nice flight!

16:23.984 --> 16:26.184
Back already?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.727
Huh?

16:37.530 --> 16:40.131
Okay.
So much for that plan.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.133
Captain marvel,
you're air support.
Iron man--

16:42.135 --> 16:45.470
hold up. I've got
a way to end this,
no rubble required.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.272
Reptil, come here.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.875
What are you doing?
Shh. It's a surprise.
Don't ruin it.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.344
Kid, bust out
your best dino-head.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.446
Uh, okay.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.683
Does this work?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.685
For a job interview
or a date, no.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.588
But for this, it's perfect.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.191
Huh?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.728
All right.
Look alive, people.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.864
No. Give the kid
some room.
What?

17:12.866 --> 17:16.401
But that thing is--
ah-ah-ah.
There's no "but" in "team."

17:16.403 --> 17:18.536
Or something like that.
Just trust me.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.045
Uh, so what am i
doing now?

17:27.047 --> 17:29.047
You're doing it already.
Keep it up.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.883
But I'm not doing anything.
Exactly. Don't move.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.719
"Don't move"? But...

17:37.057 --> 17:40.124
Hey, it thinks I'm its--
ugh-- baby.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.529
Ugh! Ugh!

17:44.531 --> 17:46.731
Okay.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.333
You can stop licking now.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.669
How'd you know
that would work?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.738
I didn't.
I just wanted to see
what would happen.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.074
Kidding.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.509
It's obvious
that that's a she,

17:58.511 --> 18:00.611
and motherly instincts
are hard to deny.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.947
That was a risky play.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.050
High risk, high reward.
It's the only
game worth playing.

18:06.052 --> 18:09.253
- Worth it for you, maybe.
- Not for him.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.956
That's what I love about you,
stars and gripes.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.059
Your glass
is always half full.
Of sour milk.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.533
Is there a plan to--
ugh-- stop the licking?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.035
'Cause...

18:24.037 --> 18:26.804
I think I'm gonna be sick.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.709
Eighth time's a charm, pal.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.945
Honestly,
i feel good about this.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.646
I am groot.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.483
So when I say, "punch it,"
you punch it.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.818
Got it?

18:41.788 --> 18:45.823
And... punch it!

18:45.825 --> 18:48.059
- Power down!
- I am groot.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.660
Power down! Power down.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.963
Power down!
Power down!

18:53.333 --> 18:54.832
Why'd you punch it?

18:54.834 --> 18:57.335
Oh, now the electrical's fried!

18:57.337 --> 18:59.437
I gotta rewire
the whole thing!

18:59.439 --> 19:02.540
And I'm out of wire!

19:05.178 --> 19:07.678
I'm sick of this
flying scrap heap.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.614
We need a new ship.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.916
I am groot.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.018
I know new ships
cost units.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.520
I am groot.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.589
I know we don't have
any units.

19:21.127 --> 19:24.128
But maybe that's
about to change.

19:24.130 --> 19:28.699
"Jolnir, a.K.A. Santa claus.
Mass burglary, animal cruelty.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.835
Stealing cookies from kids"?

19:30.837 --> 19:34.605
Well, this guy's
a real piece of work.
And the reward is...

19:34.607 --> 19:36.307
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

19:36.309 --> 19:39.210
Oh, we bag this guy,
and we can buy any ship we want.

19:39.212 --> 19:42.613
Set a course
for this alfheim place.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.028
Ah, alfheim,

19:57.030 --> 20:00.064
the most joyous
of the nine realms.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.733
How can anyone stand
a place this happy?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.068
Even elves?

20:04.070 --> 20:07.004
Agreed.
It's too warm.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.874
Fortunately,
our visit will be short.

20:09.876 --> 20:14.645
Now, where in this cursed realm
is the casket of ancient powers?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.814
Mmm.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.383
I suppose we will just

20:19.385 --> 20:21.919
have to ask
for directions then.

20:29.395 --> 20:33.564
Captain, is this
a hero's welcome,
or is treachery afoot?

20:33.566 --> 20:36.400
Hard to say.
How'd things go in asgard?

20:36.402 --> 20:41.172
All's well.
The casket of ancient winters
is once again in safe hands.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.008
Nothing out of the ordinary?

20:44.010 --> 20:48.079
Well, there was
one odd development.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.018
What's the emergency?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.520
Please tell me loki
didn't steal back that icebox.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.923
No. We believe loki
has moved on

20:58.925 --> 21:00.925
to a far more
sinister plan.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.860
"We" is an overstatement.

21:02.862 --> 21:06.264
Let's look at the facts.
Tony, the lizard attack.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.099
Is there some footage
you can--

21:08.101 --> 21:11.302
boom. Jarvis.
We know a creature
attacked the city today,

21:11.304 --> 21:13.904
and we know that despite
its size and strength,

21:13.906 --> 21:15.806
we defeated it easily.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.476
Too easily.
Thor and I believe--

21:18.478 --> 21:20.578
uh, he believes.
I, less so.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.949
...that loki sent the creature
to distract us
from his true scheme,

21:24.951 --> 21:27.551
which Thor discovered
while in asgard.

21:27.553 --> 21:28.886
Thor?

21:28.888 --> 21:31.956
I thought it less a scheme
and more a jest.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.292
Loki accuses someone
of false crimes

21:34.294 --> 21:37.128
and offers a great reward
for his capture.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.730
Loki's target has many names.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.966
In asgard, he is jolnir.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.636
Here, he is known
as Santa claus.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.972
Santa claus.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.974
Santa!

21:49.976 --> 21:53.110
Red suit, white beard?

21:53.112 --> 21:55.846
Belly like a bowl full of jelly?
Drives a flying sleigh?

21:57.750 --> 22:00.284
Reindeer with
a glow-in-the-dark nose?

22:00.286 --> 22:04.422
Whoo! A Santa bounty.
Too funny.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.958
Really? Just Thor and me?
Come on. You can't be serious.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.360
Don't I look serious?

22:09.362 --> 22:11.696
Sure. But you always
look like that.

22:11.698 --> 22:16.167
For good reason.
It may sound funny,
but Santa claus is no joke.

22:16.169 --> 22:20.004
No? Jarvis,
can you walk us through
the physics of Santa?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.606
The simple version.
<i> It would be my pleasure.</i>

22:22.608 --> 22:26.777
<i> For simplicity, we'll assume</i>
<i> there are two billion children</i>
<i> on earth.</i>

22:26.779 --> 22:30.014
<i> Using a census average</i>
<i> of 3.5 children per home,</i>

22:30.016 --> 22:33.884
<i> that's 571 million homes</i>
<i> for Santa to visit</i>
<i> in only one day,</i>

22:33.886 --> 22:37.555
<i> or 31 hours,</i>
<i> accounting for time zones</i>
<i> and the earth's rotation.</i>

22:37.557 --> 22:42.993
<i> This would require Santa</i>
<i> to visit 5,116.5 houses</i>
<i> per second</i>

22:42.995 --> 22:46.964
<i> while traveling</i>
<i> at 4,043 miles per second</i>
<i> between stops.</i>

22:46.966 --> 22:50.134
<i> Now, the sheer volume</i>
<i> of pres-- </i>
that's enough, Jarvis.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.670
Point is, it's impossible.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.372
But I knew that as a kid.
Off.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.474
Wait!
Not that it takes a genius
to figure out

22:56.476 --> 23:00.444
this scam is impossible.
Nothing is impossible
if you believe.

23:04.217 --> 23:05.549
Uh, sorry.

23:05.551 --> 23:09.754
Regardless, it may be that Santa
has incredible power.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.889
Enough to bend space-time.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.759
Loki could use
the casket of ancient powers

23:14.761 --> 23:16.761
to claim jolnir's power.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.763
Both are said to be in alfheim.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.765
But this has gone too far.

23:20.767 --> 23:24.001
Jolnir is just a legend,
a myth.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.437
Kind of like you,
Thor from asgard?

23:26.439 --> 23:28.439
Fine. Maybe this guy's
Thor's cousin.

23:28.441 --> 23:32.176
But he's not Santa,
because there is no Santa.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.413
I'll take a trip
to prove I'm right.
Let's go to alfheim.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.250
Heimdall won't open the Bifrost
to mortals for such folly,

23:39.252 --> 23:41.218
- nor should he.
- No problem.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.421
We don't need
your rainbow bridge
when we've got

23:43.423 --> 23:46.924
my dimensional gateway
transporter bridge thingamajig.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.227
I'm still working
on the name.
This is a fool's errand.

23:50.229 --> 23:53.264
So stay here.
Someone has to work on plan b--

23:53.266 --> 23:56.467
doing Santa's job
if something goes wrong.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.469
You can do that
with hulk.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.271
Ho ho ho!

24:00.273 --> 24:03.107
We'll have
a Holly jolly time.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.776
Your device is real?
We're going on a Santa quest,

24:05.778 --> 24:08.479
and you're asking
if my tech is real?
Fine.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.147
Has it been tested?

24:10.149 --> 24:14.518
Sure. Phase one of testing
started... now.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.126
Joy to another world,
huh, kid?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.461
Yes!

24:23.463 --> 24:26.497
We're gonna
meet Santa claus!

24:36.976 --> 24:40.644
Are you well, sir?
Do you require aid?

24:40.646 --> 24:45.249
Oh. Who takes pity
on these old, cold bones?

24:45.251 --> 24:48.752
Commander athidel,
of the emerald guard,
at your service.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.089
Loki!

24:52.091 --> 24:54.792
Good eye, commander athidel.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.627
So kind of you to offer help.

24:56.629 --> 25:02.500
But I fear you are in
far greater need of it than I.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.534
Hmm?

25:05.037 --> 25:08.506
Oh!

25:10.176 --> 25:12.510
Now, would you mind
directing us

25:12.512 --> 25:15.212
to the nearest
casket of ancient powers?

25:15.214 --> 25:18.616
And I'm afraid we're in
a bit of a rush.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.886
Look, I'm just saying
i know Santa claus.

25:21.888 --> 25:25.523
The stories, the songs,
all the reindeer names.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.025
I'm a Santa freak.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.194
I could be a big help
on this mission.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.664
This isn't
a training mission.
I know.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.166
No one gets what's at stake here
more than me.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.202
Santa has to be saved.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.671
That's why I want to go.
Need to go.

25:40.673 --> 25:44.708
And, hey, if I meet Santa
and become his best friend,
I'm fine with that.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.511
I'm sold.
Too bad it's not my call.

25:47.513 --> 25:51.348
No, it's mine.
And I'm afraid I've made it.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.552
We'll resume your training
when this is resolved, humberto.

25:54.554 --> 25:57.888
I'm surprised, cap.
Kid believes in this stuff.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.390
I believe it's a sham.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.859
At the very least,
his attitude offsets mine.

26:01.861 --> 26:05.029
If there was ever a mission
for him to join, this is it.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.730
Fine, fine.
He can go.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.898
Really?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.266
Yeah, really?

26:09.268 --> 26:11.168
Really. As your shadow.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.270
Ooh. Walked into that one.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.073
Yes! I promise
you won't regret this.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.942
Unless I screw up.
Which I won't.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.878
If you do,
you'll never see earth again.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.880
- Just kidding.
- Iron high five.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.683
What I don't get is,

26:25.685 --> 26:28.452
if you think
this trip's a loser,
why make it happen?

26:28.454 --> 26:31.288
Because I'm always right,
and it's my duty to prove that.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.958
Or you have no holiday plans.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.261
Because I'm selfless too.
We're clear for takeoff.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.230
By the way,
there's a small chance
we'll get separated.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.399
And by "we,"
i mean our molecules.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.401
What's the likelihood
of this gizmo

26:44.403 --> 26:47.438
actually getting us
to alfheim?

26:47.440 --> 26:49.206
Hmm. 100%.

26:49.208 --> 26:53.911
<i> The likelihood of reaching</i>
<i> alfheim safely is 78%.</i>

26:53.913 --> 26:57.715
Which, if you round up,
is basically a hundred percent.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.751
Not cool, Jarvis.
We agreed to use fuzzy math.

27:00.753 --> 27:04.088
<i> I said "math."</i>
<i> You added "fuzzy."</i>

27:12.498 --> 27:14.932
Wait. Are those cookie trees?

27:14.934 --> 27:17.568
Yeah. They look good.

27:18.671 --> 27:21.038
But I just lost
my appetite.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.843
See? Safe and sound.

27:25.845 --> 27:29.446
Sure, there's an army
of angry Archer elves
targeting us,

27:29.448 --> 27:31.982
but we get
souvenir glow arrows.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.484
That's a win in my book.

27:33.486 --> 27:36.787
I am malitri,
captain of the emerald guard.

27:36.789 --> 27:41.025
You will release
commander athidel
by the count of three.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.860
One--
wait a second.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.595
We don't have this commander.

27:44.597 --> 27:45.929
Cap, let me handle this.

27:45.931 --> 27:51.135
Forsooth, good malitrio,
light elf of the light elves.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.837
We know not of whence
hence you speak.

27:53.839 --> 27:59.510
We instead seek to query you
on a quandary most dire.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.348
Your mockery is a path
that leads only to woe,

28:04.350 --> 28:07.051
armored interloper,
for you.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.053
No, no, my spritely comrade.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.855
Your pointy-eth ears
have-- hath mistrewn-eth

28:11.857 --> 28:15.626
the words coming from my--
mine yon lips, and...

28:15.628 --> 28:19.063
Look, ear-kabobs,
fancy talk isn't my thing.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.066
But you'd love my pal Thor.
Why didn't we bring Thor again?

28:22.068 --> 28:23.734
This is right
in his wheelhouse.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.003
I grow weary
of this one's prattle.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.571
Dispatch him.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.641
You don't want
to fancy-talk it out?
Fine. Dispatch this.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.778
Wait. Where'd he go?

28:37.249 --> 28:40.217
Emerald guards,
capture them,

28:40.219 --> 28:42.152
by any means necessary.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.262
Time to separate the boys
from the other boys.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.108
Whoa. Let's start over.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.176
We're here
to protect Santa claus.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.045
You call him jolnir.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.280
The emerald guard
protects jolnir.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.383
We do not require
the help of outlanders.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.385
The point is, same team.

29:15.387 --> 29:19.757
The other team, loki and ymir--
they have a head start.

29:19.759 --> 29:23.427
Loki and ymir are
a most treacherous threat.

29:23.429 --> 29:27.297
A threat we are more than able
to counter on our own.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.966
I believe you.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.368
It's not like your commander
is missing or anything.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.472
Loki and ymir may be
using your commander

29:35.474 --> 29:37.808
to find
the casket of ancient powers.

29:37.810 --> 29:42.079
If so, we need to work together
and get there first.
Sing it, cap.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.381
Why would we
trust outlanders?

29:44.383 --> 29:47.785
Because Santa's safety
is at risk.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.187
Nothing else matters.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.526
Follow us.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.962
Um, how'd you do that?

29:58.964 --> 30:02.466
No idea.
Pretty cool,
though, right?

30:02.468 --> 30:05.636
They must think you're an elf.
Easy mistake.

30:08.073 --> 30:11.141
I remain perplexed.
By what?

30:11.143 --> 30:13.010
Why a sleigh?
Why reindeer?

30:13.012 --> 30:16.246
And why must the gifts
all be delivered in one night?

30:16.248 --> 30:18.148
Well, it's the holidays.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.484
And you like this?

30:20.486 --> 30:24.154
Like it? I love it.
Wanna know why?

30:24.156 --> 30:28.492
Yes. That's what I've been
asking you to explain
for hours.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.695
Okay. This is why
Christmas rocks.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.797
You've heard of Santa,
right?

30:33.799 --> 30:35.866
Yes, of course, hulk.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.669
Okay. Just making sure
for your sake.

30:38.671 --> 30:42.673
So, there's Santa and presents,
which kids love, of course.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.342
Anyway, now, Santa--
he can fly.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.277
And presents can be anything.

30:47.279 --> 30:50.347
A toy pony, a real pony,
or anything.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.983
Not just ponies.
Maybe I should start over.

30:52.985 --> 30:56.520
Nah, I'll keep going.
So, there's Santa,
and then there's pre--

30:56.522 --> 30:58.522
did I say that already?
I can't remember.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.024
Also, there's songs,
cookies, sleigh bells,

31:01.026 --> 31:04.061
sweaters, pine trees,
big socks, snowmen,

31:04.063 --> 31:06.029
pie, and then--

31:06.031 --> 31:08.899
boom!

31:08.901 --> 31:13.737
It's the next morning,
and you're sitting
on a brand-new pony.

31:13.739 --> 31:17.541
That was of no help
whatsoever, hulk.

31:20.346 --> 31:23.914
Looks like you picked the right
wormhole for alfheim, groot.

31:23.916 --> 31:27.084
I owe you a burrito.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.819
I am groot.

31:28.821 --> 31:31.488
What kind of twisted
fever dream is this place?

31:34.360 --> 31:36.793
What, do they grow
gingerbread men here?

31:37.830 --> 31:39.229
I am groot.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.465
Yeah, you would like it.

31:43.068 --> 31:47.404
File says this jolnir/santa guy
drives a sleigh.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.941
So, find the sleigh,
find Santa.

32:03.122 --> 32:06.490
Hey, don't eat that.
It's probably stale.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.670
I am groot!

32:28.580 --> 32:32.249
Great. See what you did?
You made the gingerbread rise.

32:32.251 --> 32:36.286
Well, one thing to do
when you're stuck
in a cookie jar-- chew 'em up!

32:53.172 --> 32:55.238
There.
Nothing but crumbs.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.140
What the sprinkles...

32:58.644 --> 33:01.845
Perfect. Zombie cookies.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.513
Come on.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.883
Let's run,
run fast as we can!

33:16.829 --> 33:19.329
Cursed cave!

33:19.331 --> 33:23.000
Athidel, if the casket
is much further,

33:23.002 --> 33:26.503
ymir may share
his discomfort with you.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.839
Our destination is near.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.842
Aah! Wretched rocks!

33:31.844 --> 33:35.078
I hope so.
For your sake.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.516
Think we'll find the casket
before loki?

33:39.518 --> 33:42.386
What happens
if they find it first?

33:42.388 --> 33:44.388
And how far
do these tunnels go?

33:44.390 --> 33:47.391
No one knows.
Those who venture too far

33:47.393 --> 33:50.394
or lose their way
never return.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.629
Glad I asked.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.965
I'm not.
Me neither.

33:54.967 --> 33:59.736
Should we be leaving
a trail of bread crumbs?
Or flares, maybe?

33:59.738 --> 34:02.606
Less talk, more walk, people.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.644
There.
There is what you seek.

34:07.646 --> 34:12.149
That's it? The casket
of ancient powers?

34:12.150 --> 34:14.851
You leave it unguarded?

34:14.853 --> 34:17.888
No. The casket's ward
is the jorokraken.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.491
And where
is the jorokraken now?

34:21.493 --> 34:25.562
Where he always is.
Beneath our feet.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.242
Aah!

34:40.579 --> 34:43.547
And he's never been fond
of uninvited guests.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.715
Elfworld
is on a fault line?

34:47.585 --> 34:50.053
Whoa. No one said anything
about tunnel quakes.

34:50.054 --> 34:54.091
That disturbance was caused
by the movement
of the jorokraken.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.394
Jorokraken?
Sounds delightful.
What is it?

34:57.396 --> 35:01.798
The jorokraken
is a great ancient beast
that skulks in the rocky depths.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.601
It is a friend
to the light elves
and jealously defends

35:04.603 --> 35:07.404
the casket of ancient powers
from all who dare seek it.

35:07.406 --> 35:11.074
That means
loki's found the casket.
Let's move.

35:16.248 --> 35:19.649
Back, vile tentacles!

35:23.622 --> 35:26.389
This creature is relentless!

35:26.391 --> 35:29.960
Aah!
And rude. Very rude.

35:32.231 --> 35:35.932
No! No! Stop it! Bad!

35:35.934 --> 35:40.437
Alfheim protects jolnir
against all trespassers.

35:42.241 --> 35:45.642
Your fates were sealed
the moment you dared
plot against him.

35:45.644 --> 35:49.513
I bid you farewell
on your journey
to oblivion.

36:01.527 --> 36:05.095
Even the most savage beast
can learn manners

36:05.097 --> 36:07.664
when given
the proper motivation.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.150
You were saying?

36:27.152 --> 36:28.652
Use care.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.021
If you open the casket
without a target,

36:31.023 --> 36:33.657
it will siphon your powers.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.458
As I assumed.

36:35.460 --> 36:39.296
I haven't made it this far
on charm alone, cold friend.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.298
You will never reach jolnir.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.534
And even if you do,
he is far too powerful for you.

36:44.536 --> 36:50.807
That, my stalwart Santa sentry,
is why we needed the box.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.381
Fool!
You'll trap us all!

36:58.383 --> 37:00.383
Wrong again.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.620
This just isn't your day.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.792
No-o-o-o!

37:10.829 --> 37:12.729
Get clear!

37:14.099 --> 37:16.766
Biggest tremor yet.
We're almost there.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.835
Or it's already here.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.178
Loki sent us a present.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.818
Why can't I ever be wrong?

37:48.267 --> 37:50.734
Keep pushing.
There has to be a weakness.

37:57.276 --> 38:00.610
Apparently
it's called a whistle.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.779
You trained the jorokraken?

38:02.781 --> 38:06.783
This relic held sway
over the jorokraken
when we found it.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.652
We know not how,

38:08.654 --> 38:11.087
but we remain grateful
for its existence.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.090
You and us both.
What happened to loki
and ymir?

38:14.092 --> 38:17.394
They escaped with the casket
and left me sealed in.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.730
Fortunately, my knowledge
of the hidden passages
allowed me to escape.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.832
These tunnels
have secret tunnels?

38:22.834 --> 38:25.568
- That's just too much tunnel.
- They're on the move.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.103
Where is jolnir?

38:27.105 --> 38:30.640
Jolnir calls the top
of mount jolly home.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.976
Of course.
I was gonna guess that.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.111
We need to get there, now.

38:35.113 --> 38:38.682
The emerald guard does not
allow outlanders on mount jolly.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.818
Yeah? Tell that
to freezy and sleazy.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.254
We will, vigorously.

38:44.256 --> 38:47.657
Look, this isn't a turf war.
We want to help.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.260
And since you coughed up
that power box,

38:50.262 --> 38:52.329
seems like you guys
could use it.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.800
Think it over,
long-bow short-fuse.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.669
Thank you.
We decline your offer.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.472
It's not an offer.
There's too much at stake.

39:02.474 --> 39:05.175
We're going.
You don't have to help us.

39:05.177 --> 39:07.377
But we won't let you
stop us.

39:13.318 --> 39:15.652
Yay. Happy ending.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.854
Sorry. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

39:19.324 --> 39:21.725
How could you
let them pass?

39:21.727 --> 39:25.095
What we began,
our brothers will finish.

39:30.235 --> 39:32.302
Season's greetings!

39:32.304 --> 39:35.004
I'm Nicholas,
store manager.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.873
But, please,
call me Nick.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.209
What can I help you find today?

39:39.211 --> 39:42.178
We seek playthings
and trinkets of amusement

39:42.180 --> 39:43.913
for the children
of this world.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.716
Ho ho ho!
You're in the right place.

39:46.718 --> 39:50.820
Toy to the world
has the widest selection
of toys in the world.

39:50.822 --> 39:54.224
Toy cars, toy planes...
Why does this man
seem familiar?

39:54.226 --> 39:58.027
'Cause he looks
like Santa claus?
No.

39:58.029 --> 40:01.331
...toy saws, toy clocks--
Nick, have we met
in the past?

40:01.333 --> 40:03.266
Um, no.

40:03.268 --> 40:06.736
I'd remember you.
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!

40:06.738 --> 40:08.738
The laugh?
The beard?

40:08.740 --> 40:11.374
Come on.
Santa claus.

40:11.376 --> 40:14.978
Nick, have you ever
journeyed to asgard?

40:15.947 --> 40:18.348
Um, is that overseas?

40:18.350 --> 40:22.452
Yes. Over seas, lands,
space, and time.

40:23.455 --> 40:26.356
Santa. Claus.

40:26.358 --> 40:30.126
Of course!
The resemblance is uncanny!

40:30.128 --> 40:33.229
So, are you looking
for a specific toy?

40:33.231 --> 40:35.565
Yeah. All of them.

40:35.567 --> 40:40.103
Indeed. We require
every toy you possess.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.905
Charge it all
to Tony stark.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.606
And you, Nick.

40:43.608 --> 40:47.477
I believe we require
you as well.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.626
That's him.
Rotten, low-life crook.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.994
Let's grab him,
quick and quiet,

41:04.996 --> 41:07.130
and get out
of this snow globe.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.833
Place gives me the creeps.
And stop eating
those gumdrops!

41:18.410 --> 41:20.643
End of the trail,
Santa claus!

41:28.019 --> 41:29.986
Nothing personal,
just business.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.755
You're worth a whole lot
of loot to somebody.

41:32.757 --> 41:34.591
Actually,
it is a bit personal!

41:34.593 --> 41:37.093
Taking cookies from kids?
How do you sleep at night?

41:39.865 --> 41:42.398
What?
Groot, lose the scarf.

41:45.370 --> 41:49.038
I said,
"I'm afraid you've got
the wrong claus."

41:49.040 --> 41:51.441
I'm Mrs. claus,

41:51.443 --> 41:53.343
Santa's wife.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.212
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.148
Oh, I wish.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.150
Oh, but I'm not much
of a jokester.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.353
Not like you two.

42:03.355 --> 42:06.456
I mean, this prank--
what a hoot!

42:06.458 --> 42:09.559
I'm so sorry I spoiled it.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.694
"Prank"?
Sure.

42:11.696 --> 42:15.698
Pretending to be bandits,
leaping out to catch Santa.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.667
Delightful!

42:17.669 --> 42:20.537
Hop in. I'll give you
a ride to our place.

42:20.539 --> 42:23.606
Santa loves it
when old friends drop by.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.376
Eh...

42:26.378 --> 42:30.046
Yeah. Yeah, we're old friends
here to play a prank on Santa.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.549
You saw right through us.

42:32.551 --> 42:35.952
Come on, groot.
This sweet old lady's
gonna help us bag her husband.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.991
So, how far are we-e-e-e...

42:48.066 --> 42:50.099
We know jolnir is up there.

42:50.101 --> 42:52.302
Why do we cower here
like rodents?

42:54.072 --> 42:57.674
Ugh! I'm unable to open
a portal on that mountain.

42:57.676 --> 43:00.610
It's shrouded in magic--
jolnir's magic.

43:00.612 --> 43:04.914
And there are
certainly more defenses
than the light elves we see.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.749
So why confront them ourselves

43:06.751 --> 43:10.887
when we can let
our willing decoys
do it for us?

43:10.889 --> 43:12.755
What decoys?

43:12.757 --> 43:15.258
Those decoys.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.527
Heroes.

43:17.529 --> 43:20.129
They're more reliable
than clocks.

43:22.434 --> 43:24.667
Halt.
Come no closer.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.437
We have no choice.

43:27.439 --> 43:31.107
We need to reach jolnir
before it's too late.
Stand down.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.776
You give no orders here,
outlander.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.578
Maybe we should
let humberto talk.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.747
That worked last time.
Just an idea.

43:37.749 --> 43:39.749
It's okay, guys.
If I was identical

43:39.751 --> 43:42.418
to everyone around me,
I'd be tense too.

43:42.420 --> 43:46.055
Now take a hike so,
you know,
we can take a hike.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.629
So, Santa's elves
make toys and weapons.

43:53.465 --> 43:55.632
Want to let humberto
talk now?

43:55.634 --> 43:57.967
Uh, might be too late.

43:57.969 --> 44:00.136
Agreed.
We're past talking.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.538
Reptil, stay close
to iron man.

44:05.744 --> 44:10.113
Try to keep up, kid.
Last one to the top
cleans up the mess.

44:10.115 --> 44:14.050
Go easy.
We're on the same side.
Not sure they got that memo.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.491
Get clear!

44:23.128 --> 44:25.328
Yeah. They're not
blowing kisses at us.

44:28.266 --> 44:30.733
Incoming at 1:00!

44:31.770 --> 44:33.936
3:00! 10:00!

44:33.938 --> 44:35.972
7:00! 8:00 and 9:00!

44:35.974 --> 44:39.542
Got it, kid.
Around-the-clock arrow-rama.

44:42.213 --> 44:44.647
Propulsion's off-line.
Going down.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.693
I'm okay.
Good. Stay put.

44:56.695 --> 44:59.429
No problem,
since I can't move.

45:02.233 --> 45:04.567
Air support headed your way.

45:07.706 --> 45:10.139
Snow down, fellas!

45:11.076 --> 45:13.042
Captain marvel, boost.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.777
Got it!

45:22.554 --> 45:25.888
Reptil, tail!

45:27.025 --> 45:30.059
What? Did you say
"tail" or "whale"?

45:30.061 --> 45:32.261
"Tail." Got it.

45:39.270 --> 45:42.138
Something's happening.

45:46.211 --> 45:49.078
Santa's gone.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.913
I can't believe it.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.783
Looks like dirt squid
called it a day too.

45:53.785 --> 45:56.185
I guess they're
a holiday package deal.

46:01.259 --> 46:04.627
Too bad the elves
weren't part of that package.

46:04.629 --> 46:07.697
So we're not
gonna meet Santa?

46:12.403 --> 46:15.605
I'm, uh, not so sure
this is a good idea, guys.

46:15.607 --> 46:18.741
Nonsense, Nick.
You were born
for this endeavor.

46:18.743 --> 46:21.611
In this sleigh,
you will bring hope and joy

46:21.613 --> 46:23.613
to children everywhere.
Oh.

46:23.615 --> 46:26.783
Well, that sounds
pretty good. Ugh!

46:26.785 --> 46:29.952
Are we ready
for a test flight?

46:29.954 --> 46:31.621
Sky looks clear.

46:31.623 --> 46:35.625
And your helmet wings
look like antlers if you squint.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.661
Wait. Flight?

46:38.663 --> 46:40.730
That was a joke, right?

46:40.732 --> 46:44.801
Flying terrifies me-e-e!

46:48.773 --> 46:51.641
You will wait
for commander athidel.

46:51.643 --> 46:54.243
No, thank you.
No more waiting.

46:54.245 --> 46:57.146
It's time to say good night.
Follow my lead.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.148
Wait. Please,
just hear me out.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.951
You elves are sworn
to protect Santa.

47:01.953 --> 47:06.355
But Santa's gone,
so... we're all good, right?

47:10.962 --> 47:13.830
Whew.
Seriously, what is that?
Dino-hypnotism?

47:13.832 --> 47:16.098
You think I know?
No one listens to me.

47:16.100 --> 47:18.301
You don't listen to me.
It's not personal.

47:18.303 --> 47:20.303
- Who listens to kids?
- We do.

47:20.305 --> 47:22.672
And the young one
speaks true.

47:22.674 --> 47:26.843
Jolnir has departed,
eliminating the cause
for conflict between us.

47:26.845 --> 47:28.344
You're free to go.

47:28.346 --> 47:29.879
Yeah, yeah.
I get that part.

47:29.881 --> 47:31.881
But why do you guys
only listen to the kid?

47:31.883 --> 47:35.685
The greater the youth,
the greater the truth.

47:35.687 --> 47:38.521
Indeed.
Youth is an asset.

47:38.523 --> 47:41.357
The young are dear to jolnir.
But more importantly,

47:41.359 --> 47:44.327
we light elves can sense
who believes in jolnir

47:44.329 --> 47:46.128
and who does not.

47:46.130 --> 47:47.663
Humberto believes.

47:47.665 --> 47:50.166
And we trust the words
of a believer.

47:50.168 --> 47:52.034
How'd he know my name?

47:52.036 --> 47:53.703
You think I know?

47:53.705 --> 47:57.173
So where is jolnir?
Where did he go?

47:57.175 --> 48:00.543
The time of giving--
when jolnir distributes gifts

48:00.545 --> 48:03.312
to the children
of the nine realms--
is at hand.

48:03.314 --> 48:07.316
It begins on the world
closest to ours, midgard,

48:07.318 --> 48:09.752
in a remote location
of jolnir's choosing.

48:09.754 --> 48:12.989
I believe you call it
the north pole.

48:12.991 --> 48:14.690
Ha! I knew it!

48:14.692 --> 48:17.226
That's loki's next target.
We need to get there now.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.228
Regretfully,
we cannot join you.

48:19.230 --> 48:23.099
Per jolnir's wishes,
our duties end when
the time of giving begins.

48:23.101 --> 48:27.770
So even Santa's elves
get the holidays off.
But not us. Nice.

48:27.772 --> 48:31.073
Evil doesn't observe holidays.
Let's roll.

48:31.075 --> 48:33.876
Isn't this a hoot?

48:37.615 --> 48:40.583
I am groot, I am groot,
i am groot!

48:40.585 --> 48:42.718
What's that?

48:44.255 --> 48:46.923
It's a ramp! Why?

48:46.925 --> 48:49.759
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

48:49.761 --> 48:52.695
Aaaahhhh!

49:01.239 --> 49:02.838
Here we are.

49:04.876 --> 49:07.310
Oh, snickerdoodles!

49:07.312 --> 49:09.312
We must've just missed him.

49:09.314 --> 49:11.547
Don't worry.
I know where he is.

49:11.549 --> 49:13.616
I'll have us there
in no time.

49:13.618 --> 49:15.618
No!

49:15.620 --> 49:18.888
I mean, no,
you've been so kind.

49:18.890 --> 49:20.957
We've imposed enough
on you.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.558
We have a ship.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.461
If you could just tell us
where we can find him.

49:25.463 --> 49:28.931
A ship?
How wonderful!

49:28.933 --> 49:31.133
I've always wanted
to fly a ship.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.635
Let's go!

49:32.637 --> 49:35.805
I am groo-oo-oot!

49:37.241 --> 49:39.809
It was thoughtful of jolnir
to depart.

49:39.811 --> 49:42.311
This mountain now yields
before my magic.

49:42.313 --> 49:45.014
Loki and ymir,
stand down or perish!

49:45.016 --> 49:49.185
Hear me out.
I have a proposition.

49:49.187 --> 49:53.255
Come with me to midgard,
help me claim jolnir's powers,

49:53.257 --> 49:57.693
and I will reward you in ways
your former master never did.

49:57.695 --> 50:01.464
You'll find no evil minions
here, fiend.

50:01.466 --> 50:05.267
The emerald guard
will never conspire with you.

50:05.269 --> 50:09.105
Oh, very well.
If you insist,
we can just do it the easy way.

50:22.620 --> 50:26.422
See? Now we're all friends.

50:27.558 --> 50:30.526
No sign of Santa's cottage
on my end.

50:30.528 --> 50:32.661
No activity
on the thermal sensors.

50:32.663 --> 50:35.364
N-n-nothing here either.

50:35.366 --> 50:37.366
You still cold, kid?

50:37.368 --> 50:39.568
Of course.
He's cold-blooded.

50:39.570 --> 50:42.538
N-n-no.
I'm fine.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.807
Okay. Let's land,
get more layers on humberto,

50:44.809 --> 50:46.575
and search the forested areas
on foot.

50:46.577 --> 50:50.046
We're gonna need more bodies.
I'll signal Thor and hulk.

50:51.649 --> 50:56.519
I suspect Santa claus
would smile more
and shriek less, Nick.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.725
Ah. Better.

51:02.727 --> 51:05.161
Now, aim true, hulk.

51:05.163 --> 51:08.397
Let's deliver some gifts.

51:08.399 --> 51:12.134
Toys away!

51:23.448 --> 51:26.415
Ho ho ho! Whoo!

51:26.417 --> 51:28.684
Perhaps with less force.

51:28.686 --> 51:31.921
Sorry. I'll turn down
the heat for ya.

51:31.923 --> 51:34.924
So I'm the only one
who finds it convenient

51:34.926 --> 51:37.760
that Santa's house vanished
right when we found it?

51:37.762 --> 51:40.930
This is a prank,
and those elf-alikes
are in on it.

51:40.932 --> 51:43.265
Maybe. But we can't
take that chance.

51:43.267 --> 51:46.368
If Santa is out here,
we need to find him
before loki does.

51:46.370 --> 51:49.438
Wait up! Moving is tricky
in all these clothes.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.774
But I got it.
I got it. Whoa!

51:51.776 --> 51:54.777
Lost it!
Got it again.

51:54.779 --> 51:56.612
Hello?
Is anybody out there?

51:56.614 --> 51:58.948
Unless he doesn't
wanna be found.

51:58.950 --> 52:01.117
If Santa's the powerhouse
they say he is,

52:01.119 --> 52:04.220
he could be walking in this
winter wonderland with us,
and we'd never know.

52:04.222 --> 52:06.422
Another reason why
this is pointless,

52:06.424 --> 52:08.257
not that we needed
another reason.

52:08.259 --> 52:10.459
Do you have some place
you'd rather be tonight?

52:10.461 --> 52:12.294
Yes! Don't you?

52:12.296 --> 52:15.764
Hey, simmer down, fellas.
Landing on the naughty list
won't fix this.

52:15.766 --> 52:18.934
There is no naughty list,
because there is no Santa.

52:18.936 --> 52:24.306
Uh, guys, maybe it's just
that my eyeballs are frozen,
but look.

52:24.308 --> 52:28.644
Is that Santa's house?
Santa's nice, cozy, warm house?

52:28.646 --> 52:32.515
Santa? Santa claus?
You in here?

52:32.517 --> 52:34.850
Empty.
But he's gotta be close.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.652
Let's fan out.
Two-mile perimeter.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.487
Maintain constant contact
with--
oh, heat.

52:38.489 --> 52:39.788
Heat, heat, heat, heat.

52:39.790 --> 52:43.626
Ohh, heat.

52:43.628 --> 52:46.128
Oh, yeah.
That's the stuff.

52:51.035 --> 52:55.271
On second thought,
i could use a moment
to warm up.

52:55.273 --> 52:59.008
Reptil, make room.
Really?

52:59.010 --> 53:02.344
Getting awfully close
to those asteroids.

53:02.346 --> 53:05.147
Thank you so much
for letting me fly
your ship.

53:05.149 --> 53:08.050
It's always been
a little dream of mine.

53:08.052 --> 53:11.153
Oh...
It's my pleasure.

53:11.155 --> 53:14.623
But we need to steer
away from those asteroids.

53:14.625 --> 53:16.792
Aw, looks like fun.

53:16.794 --> 53:18.861
Let's live a little.

53:20.031 --> 53:22.031
I'd actually rather live a lot,

53:22.033 --> 53:24.700
which is why I don't want
to squeeze through that gap!

53:24.702 --> 53:27.336
So Santa was expecting
your visit?

53:27.338 --> 53:30.372
Uh, no.
It was last minute.
A business opportunity--

53:30.374 --> 53:31.874
look out!
Popped up.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.409
Lots of money--
pull up!

53:33.411 --> 53:35.878
To be made.

53:35.880 --> 53:38.981
And you want to make
a lot of money?

53:38.983 --> 53:40.983
Absolutely.
Watch it!

53:40.985 --> 53:43.552
That's our ticket to
a new ship.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.854
What's wrong
with this ship?

53:45.856 --> 53:47.890
Seems like it runs
just fine.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.326
Thanks to me.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.027
And I'd like
to keep it that way.

53:52.029 --> 53:54.063
No! We're not gonna make it!

54:03.674 --> 54:05.908
You worry too much.

54:05.910 --> 54:07.743
Santa was the same way

54:07.745 --> 54:11.580
until he made giving gifts
to children his life's work.

54:11.582 --> 54:14.917
Uh... come again?

54:14.919 --> 54:18.554
He spends all year
preparing for tonight.

54:18.556 --> 54:22.958
Every child-- who they are,
where they are, what they want.

54:22.960 --> 54:26.128
All those gifts.
And then-- boom,

54:26.130 --> 54:31.166
he delivers
every single present himself
in one night.

54:32.036 --> 54:35.204
Santa does this.
Santa claus.

54:35.206 --> 54:36.905
Of course. Who else?

54:36.907 --> 54:39.875
Now, I tell him,
spread it out

54:39.877 --> 54:43.279
over a few weeks or months,
and he refuses.

54:43.281 --> 54:44.713
You know why?

54:44.715 --> 54:48.384
Because he doesn't want to make
even one child wait.

54:48.386 --> 54:51.720
And he gets nothing in return.

54:51.722 --> 54:54.089
That's not how he sees it.

54:54.091 --> 54:58.560
He says the joy of giving
is the greatest gift of all.

54:58.562 --> 55:01.697
And that's why I love him.

55:05.403 --> 55:07.503
I am groot.

55:07.505 --> 55:09.405
You're right, pal.

55:09.407 --> 55:11.840
It looks like we do have
this one all wrong.

55:15.946 --> 55:18.881
Unbelievable!

55:20.017 --> 55:23.952
Mm. Best hot chocolate ever.

55:23.954 --> 55:27.489
This is exactly how
Santa's hot chocolate
should taste.

55:27.491 --> 55:29.491
All part of the charade.

55:29.493 --> 55:32.161
What are you looking for
over there?
Cameras.

55:32.163 --> 55:34.363
We're probably being filmed
for some prank show.

55:34.365 --> 55:36.832
<i> Holly jolly follies, </i>
or something like that.

55:36.834 --> 55:39.968
Ugh! Why are you so down
on Santa claus?

55:39.970 --> 55:44.039
A better question is,
why aren't you more
down on him, kid?

55:45.142 --> 55:48.777
Memories.
Some of the best I have.

55:48.779 --> 55:51.113
<i> My parents</i>
<i> were paleontologists.</i>

55:51.115 --> 55:55.117
<i> Spent a lot of time on digs,</i>
<i> living in tents.</i>

55:55.119 --> 55:58.520
<i> Space was tight,</i>
<i> so toys were a luxury.</i>

56:01.058 --> 56:03.325
<i> One year, I lost my favorite.</i>

56:03.327 --> 56:05.861
<i> I was scared</i>
<i> to tell my parents,</i>
<i> so I wrote to Santa,</i>

56:05.863 --> 56:08.630
<i> asking for a new one.</i>

56:08.632 --> 56:11.967
<i> That morning, I wake up,</i>

56:11.969 --> 56:13.969
<i> our tent's a jungle,</i>

56:13.971 --> 56:17.206
<i> and there's</i>
<i> toy dinos everywhere.</i>

56:17.208 --> 56:20.209
We spent all day in there,
just playing.

56:20.211 --> 56:23.579
I still have every one
of those dinosaurs.

56:23.581 --> 56:25.881
Little me
was obsessed with planes.

56:25.883 --> 56:28.217
I'd never been in one,
but I loved them.

56:28.219 --> 56:32.187
One year I asked Santa
for a top-of-the-line
f-15 model kit.

56:32.189 --> 56:34.189
<i> But I didn't get it.</i>

56:34.191 --> 56:37.059
<i> Instead, I got tickets</i>
<i> to an air show,</i>

56:37.061 --> 56:41.663
where I got to sit
in the cockpit
of a real f-15.

56:41.665 --> 56:45.234
That's when I knew
I'd be a pilot.

56:45.236 --> 56:47.903
I was a big fan
of baseball as a kid.

56:47.905 --> 56:52.107
But I wasn't athletic,
so I was never picked
for a team by the other kids.

56:52.109 --> 56:56.678
<i> When I wrote to Santa,</i>
<i> I didn't ask for toys.</i>

56:56.680 --> 56:58.580
<i> I asked for a chance to play.</i>

56:58.582 --> 57:00.916
<i> I got a brand-new bat</i>
<i> and ball that year--</i>

57:00.918 --> 57:03.252
<i> items my family</i>
<i> couldn't afford.</i>

57:03.254 --> 57:05.988
And they were my ticket
into the game.

57:07.291 --> 57:09.291
I was awful.

57:09.293 --> 57:12.194
I couldn't throw,
catch, or hit.

57:12.196 --> 57:15.264
And I loved
every second of it.

57:15.266 --> 57:17.800
Okay. I'll play
your little reindeer game.

57:17.802 --> 57:22.204
I was six when I told my dad
i didn't believe in Santa claus.

57:22.206 --> 57:24.640
<i> My dad suggested</i>
<i> I take it up with Santa.</i>

57:24.642 --> 57:28.877
<i> So I did.</i>
<i> I wrote to Santa and told him</i>
<i> to keep his presents.</i>

57:28.879 --> 57:31.747
<i> All I wanted was proof</i>
<i> that he was real.</i>

57:31.749 --> 57:35.250
<i> After the holidays,</i>
<i> the letter came back unopened.</i>

57:35.252 --> 57:37.786
<i> It was marked "undeliverable."</i>

57:37.788 --> 57:41.290
So, I tore it up
and threw it away.

57:41.292 --> 57:44.326
Because I had my proof.
There's no Santa.

57:44.328 --> 57:46.495
You don't need proof
to believe.

57:46.497 --> 57:49.598
Maybe you don't, kid.
But I'm a scientist at heart.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.901
Always have been.
And that means
i won't believe it

57:52.903 --> 57:54.636
until I see it.

57:58.642 --> 58:00.476
Get down!

58:09.186 --> 58:10.519
Hm.

58:10.521 --> 58:12.988
I grow weary of waiting.

58:12.990 --> 58:15.123
Where is jolnir?

58:15.125 --> 58:17.593
Where is your Santa claus?

58:17.595 --> 58:20.095
Do you really think
we'll tell you, loki?

58:20.097 --> 58:24.066
That really would be ideal.

58:40.684 --> 58:42.684
Double down on blizzard king.

58:56.467 --> 58:58.934
Aah!

59:06.710 --> 59:09.378
Need a hand, cap?

59:09.380 --> 59:11.446
Or maybe a tail?

59:14.885 --> 59:16.351
You're catching on, humberto.

59:16.353 --> 59:18.720
I've always learned fast.

59:18.722 --> 59:21.290
In third grade, I...

59:29.934 --> 59:32.034
Ymir, freeze them slowly.

59:32.036 --> 59:36.405
Perhaps they'll talk
before the cold
steals their breath.

59:36.407 --> 59:37.739
Indeed.

59:37.741 --> 59:42.144
Ice is the bringer
of truth.

59:45.249 --> 59:47.215
What treachery is this?

59:47.217 --> 59:48.116
Aah!

59:52.923 --> 59:54.690
Presents?

59:54.692 --> 59:56.658
Aaahh!

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:09.104
Your aim is much
improved, hulk.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.572
Call me Santa hulk.

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:13.809
Now, this is a worthy
holiday tradition--

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:15.377
glorious battle.

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.813
Glad you could join us.
Wait.

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:20.616
Is that-- did you find--

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:22.618
Santa claus? Nay.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.453
This is our friend Nick.

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.388
He is a most convincing
doppelgãnger.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.390
And he's as close
as we're gonna get.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:31.893
Oh, I hope not,
for the sake of the boy.

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.262
Deliver Santa to me,

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:37.065
or I deliver your young friend
to his doom.

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:38.600
You won't do it, loki.

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:42.170
Wrong! I will do whatever
it takes to prevail.

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:46.308
That is what gives me
the advantage
over you... heroes.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.176
End this madness, brother.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:50.812
I'm about to, brother.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.781
Reptil, down!

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.024
Hm.

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:07.095
Last chance.
Find Santa claus.

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:09.631
Ho ho ho!

01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:13.268
No need to look
for that which is found.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.037
It's him.

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:17.706
It's really him!
It's him!
It's Santa claus!

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:19.975
Deck... the... halls.

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.443
Santa, look out!

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:26.782
Ho ho ho!

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:31.853
You can control space-time.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.723
And you can be nice, loki,

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:37.025
but you choose to be naughty.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.361
Will you change your ways?

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:44.266
Oh, I will change,
with your help.

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:50.372
Oh! Oh!

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.146
No!

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.686
Got your back, Santa!

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:05.654
No, reptil!

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.892
A touching display,
dino-child,

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:14.429
but the casket was too quick,
and you too late.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:17.599
Come on, Santa.
Say it with me.

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:19.234
"Ho ho ho."

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:21.536
The power of Santa claus!

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:24.840
All mine!

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:32.347
You mortal insects,
time is about to pass you by.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:03:00.075
Oh, so much power.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:02.110
The perfect present.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.412
Hope you kept the receipt,

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:06.748
'cause you're returning
that gift.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.085
Or exchanging it,
depending on store policy.

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:13.622
Your might can overcome
many things, my friends,

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:17.793
but I fear a rift in
the very fabric of existence

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.895
is not one of them.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.901
Santa, you gotta wake up.

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:27.569
We need you.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:30.972
I always believed in you.
I'm not gonna stop now.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.678
Farewell, heroes.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.648
Take comfort in knowing
loki's earth

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.684
would not be to your liking.

01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:45.320
Earth isn't yours
just yet, loki.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:48.523
I'll admit
you have spirit, Santa.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:53.662
But spirit is no more useful
than your hat.

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.297
What? How?

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:58.967
If there's belief,
there's Santa claus.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:00.769
Thanks for filling in, Nick.

01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:04.773
Whew. Did my best.
I'm no you, Santa.

01:04:04.775 --> 01:04:08.844
You could've fooled me, Nick.
It's like looking in a mirror.

01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:16.484
I have your immense power,
and you can barely stand.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:19.287
You're no match for me.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.289
He is with our help.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:24.226
And, like me,
you owe Santa an apology.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:36.404
I should be at home right now!

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.291
Don't let up.
He's too dangerous.

01:05:08.839 --> 01:05:10.338
Put the bow on him, kid.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.344
Here's a couple presents
just for you, loki.

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:35.430
Your minds are once again free
from loki's tyranny,
elves of alfheim.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:38.767
And that is what
the holidays are all about.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:40.769
I got a confession
to make.

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:44.773
I pushed for you
to come along
to mess with cap.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:46.274
I know.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:49.577
But I still wanted to prove
i deserve to be
on this team someday.

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:52.914
And you did.
I was wrong.
You were right.

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:56.718
You weren't a trainee today.
You were one of us-- a hero.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.821
You did good, humberto.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:03.291
Ow.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:06.895
The emerald guard
now controls you, loki.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:17.305
Anyway, it's a true honor
to finally meet you,

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.107
Santa-- sir!

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:22.911
Did I say that already?
The honor is mine,
humberto.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:28.450
Are you okay,
Mr. claus?

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.585
It's "Santa," Steve.

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:32.921
Feeling stronger
by the second.

01:06:32.923 --> 01:06:36.324
I'm a bit behind schedule,
but I'll make do.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.026
I always have.

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:40.829
And you will tonight,
because we're gonna help.

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:42.897
It's the least we can do.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.101
It's the least I can do

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:48.003
for doubting you.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:51.539
Oh, don't be too hard
on yourself, Tony.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.175
Even your brain
can't be right all the time.

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.978
So we can help?
'Cause I've been practicing.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.682
Why not?
The more, the merrier.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.350
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:07.222
Warm-blooded wretches!

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:11.092
Ice conquers all!

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:18.533
Whoa!

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:22.971
Ha...

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:31.146
Aahh!

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:46.861
Hi, honey!

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:50.098
And there's the missus.
Hello, dear!

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.833
See, rocket?

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:55.236
You saved everyone
from that awful ice giant.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.739
Isn't giving wonderful?

01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:00.275
Yeah. Feels pretty good.

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:04.579
It would feel a lot better
in a new ship, though.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.651
Shall we? Wait.
How do I look?

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:16.124
Not bad, Nick.

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:18.126
Ow!
Not bad at all.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:21.462
Ho ho ho ho
ho ho ho ho!

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:23.598
Is this sleigh new, Santa?

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.634
Yes. My gift to me.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.435
You okay, Nick?

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.104
Mm...

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.408
I'm giving him a new car.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:18.419
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:21.723
One last delivery.
Heroes get presents
tonight too.

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.929
Reptil, thank you
for saving me,

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.666
for believing in me,
for being my friend.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:36.171
Ooh. Ooh.

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:40.942
It's so...

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.676
It's-- it's--

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:46.113
it's really right here--
new ship...

01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:48.883
It's so beautiful!

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.720
I am groot.

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.623
You're both welcome.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.026
Now, let's take it
for a spin.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:02.697
Rebuild Santa's cottage!

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:05.466
He has his power back.
Why can't he do it?

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:08.970
Finish it,
or we finish you,
villain.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:17.212
So, what did Santa give you?

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:19.347
I don't believe it.

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:21.482
It's the letter.
My letter.

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:23.484
The one I wrote to Santa
as a kid.

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:25.553
But I tore it up.
It's impossible.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:30.058
Nothing's impossible
if you believe.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:44.572
You have all given me
something to believe in.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.374
I am groot.

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:49.577
That's kind, groot,
but we don't need

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.613
any more presents.

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:01.756
