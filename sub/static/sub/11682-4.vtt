<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.535 --> 00:07.137
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.204 --> 00:09.606
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.673 --> 00:12.290
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.358 --> 00:14.017
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.085 --> 00:16.725
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.792 --> 00:19.966
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:20.034 --> 00:22.602
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.669 --> 00:24.204
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.272 --> 00:25.837
Should we shoot them?

00:25.905 --> 00:28.405
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.473 --> 00:30.805
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.873 --> 00:33.340
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:35.507
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.575 --> 00:38.009
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.077 --> 00:39.679
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

<i>It's a cliché that spies</i>
<i>wear tuxedos in the field.</i>

00:56.174 --> 00:57.744
<i>While there's some truth to it,</i>

00:57.812 --> 01:00.881
<i>you don't usually wear them to</i>
<i>baccarat tables in Monte Carlo.</i>

01:00.949 --> 01:02.917
<i>Most of the time</i>
<i>you're in black tie,</i>

01:02.984 --> 01:06.220
<i>it's at rubber-chicken dinners,</i>
<i>political fundraisers,</i>

01:06.288 --> 01:07.689
<i>or charity auctions.</i>

01:07.757 --> 01:10.159
<i>Not quite as glamorous</i>
<i>as the French Riviera,</i>

01:10.227 --> 01:12.563
<i>but at least you'll usually get</i>
<i>free drinks.</i>

01:12.631 --> 01:14.866
Oh. It's you.

01:14.934 --> 01:16.502
Don't you
clean up quick.

01:16.569 --> 01:18.605
Didn't have much choice. You
gave me only 45 minutes' notice.

01:18.673 --> 01:20.107
Sorry about that.

01:20.175 --> 01:22.345
The boys up at Langley just
got wind of a little situation.

01:22.412 --> 01:23.879
We're gonna have to
run this up on the fly.

01:26.750 --> 01:27.885
What's the job?

01:27.952 --> 01:29.986
A yet-to-be identified
foreign government

01:30.054 --> 01:32.422
plans on stealing tech secrets
from the Swedes.

01:32.490 --> 01:34.558
At a fundraiser
for marine animals.

01:34.626 --> 01:35.560
Mm-hmm.

01:35.627 --> 01:37.428
Gunther Ehren.

01:37.496 --> 01:39.663
He's got a soft spot
for manatees.

01:39.731 --> 01:42.232
He owns Jetswede, the high-end
aeronautics company.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.234
And you see that tablet
he's carrying?

01:44.302 --> 01:46.970
Idiot's got his entire computer
backed up on that thing.

01:47.037 --> 01:50.006
We're talking design specs,
contracts, prototypes.

01:50.073 --> 01:53.109
That is
a tech thief's dream.

01:53.176 --> 01:54.743
Since it's
just the two of us,

01:54.811 --> 01:56.579
I take it we're not here
to stop the thief.

01:56.604 --> 01:57.413
Oh, no.

01:57.414 --> 01:58.915
We just want to find out
who's behind it.

02:00.150 --> 02:02.652
State-of-the-art
R.F.I.D. tracker inside.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.254
Ain't micro-technology
something?

02:04.321 --> 02:05.655
It's like the future.

02:05.723 --> 02:07.024
You want me to plant this

02:07.091 --> 02:09.160
on a target
we still haven't identified?

02:09.228 --> 02:11.195
Told you, the company's flying
by the seat of its pants here.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.733
Well, I guess you called
the right guy.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.403
Super.
Keep an eye on Gunther.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.472
And try some of the seviche
while you're at it.

02:31.450 --> 02:34.018
$1,700,
looking for the eight.

02:34.086 --> 02:36.420
$1,800, the bid to nine.
$1,900. $2,000.

02:36.488 --> 02:37.989
$2,100. Back to you now.

02:38.056 --> 02:39.691
What'd I miss?

02:39.759 --> 02:41.426
Just Gunther
putting down

02:41.494 --> 02:43.362
his fourth plate
of tiger prawns.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.530
They are very good.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.766
Uh-oh.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.602
Somebody's got
the thousand-yard stare.

02:48.670 --> 02:49.904
What is it?

02:49.971 --> 02:51.805
Did you ever read
the report I submitted?

02:51.873 --> 02:54.475
I know it was long, but we're
talking about four years of --

02:54.543 --> 02:56.110
<i>again</i> with the people
that burned you?

02:56.178 --> 02:58.312
Michael, you were there.
We broke them to pieces.

02:58.380 --> 03:01.339
We ground them into dust.
It's over. You won.

03:01.339 --> 03:03.706
I guess. But I flagged
some inconsistencies

03:03.986 --> 03:05.654
the agency
should look into.

03:05.721 --> 03:07.689
- Westen --
- Questions that never got answered.

03:07.757 --> 03:09.591
Relax.

03:09.659 --> 03:11.659
Thank you. That concludes
our California vintage.

03:11.727 --> 03:14.095
We will take a...

03:14.163 --> 03:16.531
You keep playing the boy who cried
"Shouldn't we triple-check this?"

03:16.598 --> 03:18.366
People are gonna start thinking
that you're a nut.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.168
Because you sound
like a nut.

03:24.841 --> 03:27.009
Max, wait a second.
Here we go.

03:27.077 --> 03:29.578
We got action
on our computer thieves.

03:34.852 --> 03:36.352
We're on.

03:38.422 --> 03:40.423
Hey!

03:40.491 --> 03:42.125
Where the hell
do you think you're going,

03:42.193 --> 03:44.194
you weasel-faced son of a bitch!
Are you talking to me?

03:44.261 --> 03:46.529
I know what you're doing, and
I really don't appreciate it!

03:46.597 --> 03:47.337
Excuse me, but I --

03:47.362 --> 03:50.162
You have been driving up
the prices on me all day!

03:50.201 --> 03:52.303
You made me lose
the Diamond Creek Cabernet!

03:52.371 --> 03:54.205
- It's because of you. Because --
- easy, easy.

03:54.272 --> 03:55.506
No, no, James!
It's not worth it.

03:55.574 --> 03:57.808
This is between me
and my new pal, weasel-face.

03:57.876 --> 03:59.644
- You're drunk, and you're confused.
- Am I?! Am I?

03:59.711 --> 04:01.178
Well, let's just see.
Let me see your paddle.

04:01.246 --> 04:02.613
<i>Pretending to be</i>
<i>a belligerent drunk</i>

04:02.681 --> 04:04.515
<i>lets you get close to a target</i>
<i>long enough</i>

04:04.583 --> 04:07.585
<i>to plant a tracker without them</i>
<i>getting suspicious.</i>

04:07.653 --> 04:10.421
Get the hell off of me!
<i>Of course, if you plan</i>

04:10.489 --> 04:12.156
<i>on making a scene</i>
<i>at a fancy hotel,</i>

04:12.224 --> 04:14.258
<i>you'd better be ready</i>
<i>to pay the price.</i>

04:14.325 --> 04:16.327
Easy, guys,
we're leaving.

04:16.394 --> 04:17.795
You better be.

04:17.863 --> 04:19.696
Okay!

04:19.764 --> 04:22.633
So, we good?

04:22.701 --> 04:25.236
Tracker signal's at full
and on the move.

04:25.304 --> 04:26.404
We have lift-off.

04:26.472 --> 04:27.639
Oh.

04:27.707 --> 04:29.308
Oh,
hope that's not a rental.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.193
<i>Seeing a project</i>
<i>through to completion</i>

04:39.242 --> 04:42.544
<i>requires a certain level</i>

04:42.612 --> 04:44.813
<i>The problem is</i>
<i>you can't turn it on and off.</i>

04:44.881 --> 04:48.417

04:56.526 --> 04:59.194
Fi...
Can you give it a try?

04:59.262 --> 05:01.296
Not until you answer
my question.

05:01.364 --> 05:02.998
What did Max say

05:03.066 --> 05:04.913
about your report on the people
who burned you?

05:04.938 --> 05:06.138
Not much.

05:10.975 --> 05:12.509
Your obsession with this

05:12.577 --> 05:14.778
is starting to wear on me --
on us.

05:14.846 --> 05:16.547
Now,
I want a real answer.

05:16.615 --> 05:18.616
Did Max buy your theory
on loose ends?

05:18.684 --> 05:21.685
He said it wasn't worth pursuing
and I should drop it.

05:21.753 --> 05:24.221
And?

05:24.288 --> 05:25.455
I'm dropping it.

05:25.523 --> 05:27.390
I'm starting to like Max.

05:31.228 --> 05:33.462
Sounds like you need
a new distributor.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.998
I'm sorry to interrupt, but your friend
Barry is here with his brother.

05:36.066 --> 05:38.701
His brother?
There are two of them?

05:38.769 --> 05:40.536
They have a problem.
I said you'd help.

05:40.604 --> 05:41.971
I'm off to aqua-yoga.

05:42.039 --> 05:46.810
We are practicing underwater
chakra meditations today.

05:46.878 --> 05:49.312
Be good.

05:52.217 --> 05:53.885
Fi, I have a meeting
with Max --

05:53.952 --> 05:55.219
Say no more.

05:55.287 --> 05:57.588
Maybe he can talk
even more sense into you. Go.

05:57.656 --> 05:59.490
I'll handle Barry.

06:05.463 --> 06:08.731
Fi! Long time, no see.
Where's Mikey?

06:08.799 --> 06:11.033
Swallow, then speak,
Barry.

06:11.101 --> 06:12.835
Fi, I'd like you to meet
my brother Paul.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.904
- He's screwed six ways from Sunday.
- Nice to meet you.

06:14.971 --> 06:17.406
Barry talks about you and your
friends like you're superheroes.

06:17.474 --> 06:19.075
Oh, well, we get lucky
every once in a while.

06:19.142 --> 06:20.743
What kind of trouble
you in?

06:20.811 --> 06:23.413
I manage the Dade County
Teachers Credit Union.

06:23.481 --> 06:25.315
Yeah, finances
run in the family,

06:25.383 --> 06:27.985
except Paul here,
he follows the rules.

06:28.052 --> 06:30.020
Last night, somebody stole
an encrypted server

06:30.088 --> 06:31.990
filled with thousands
of member records --

06:32.057 --> 06:33.792
social-security numbers,
account info...

06:33.859 --> 06:35.126
Did you report it?

06:35.194 --> 06:37.630
We keep the records
in a secure area.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.799
You need a pin and a
call-and-response key to get in.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.335
I checked the logs.
I don't know how, but --

06:43.402 --> 06:46.338
Whoever did this stole your
access codes and key to get in.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.707
Bingo.
Enter black-sheep Barry.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.777
I can't get an invite
to my niece's birthday party,

06:51.844 --> 06:53.978
but, uh, I got a call for this.
Not fair, Barry.

06:54.046 --> 06:57.048
Last time I invited you to a family
function, you brought an escort.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.150
Hey, Fi, will you tell him
that wearing a short skirt

06:59.218 --> 07:00.552
does not make you
a prostitute?

07:00.620 --> 07:02.654
She actually said,
"I am an escort."

07:02.722 --> 07:05.791
Did you come here for family
counseling, or do you need help?

07:05.859 --> 07:07.226
This isn't
just about me.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.295
I mean, if those records
get decrypted,

07:09.362 --> 07:11.797
6,000 teachers are gonna lose
everything they have

07:11.865 --> 07:13.099
in the blink of an eye.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.601
Please,
help me get it back.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.271
Aww.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.206
I know that look.
She's in.

07:27.646 --> 07:30.581
<i>Intelligence-agency</i>
<i>field offices</i>

07:30.649 --> 07:32.350
<i>have to find a delicate balance</i>

07:32.418 --> 07:34.819
<i>between blending in and</i>
<i>providing adequate security...</i>

07:34.886 --> 07:36.120
Come on, Westen.

07:36.188 --> 07:38.489
I got a tee time
I'm trying to make.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.361
<i>...Which is why, whenever</i>
<i>possible, they piggyback</i>

07:43.428 --> 07:46.631
<i>onto the facilities</i>
<i>of fellow government agencies.</i>

07:46.699 --> 07:50.234
This...
belongs to you now.

07:50.302 --> 07:52.236
Bosses cleared you
for a temporary key card.

07:52.304 --> 07:54.739
Keep up the good work, and
maybe you'll get a real one.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.076
Must be my lucky day.
Oh, it gets better.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.178
We followed the tracker

08:00.245 --> 08:02.679
that you planted on the thieves
at the auction.

08:02.747 --> 08:04.014
The tablet's being held

08:04.081 --> 08:06.283
at a company called
Vaxilar Investments.

08:06.351 --> 08:09.452
Vaxilar Investments.
Sounds vague.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.686
Well,
it's a shell company

08:10.754 --> 08:12.321
with ties
to the French government.

08:12.389 --> 08:14.457
Turns out the frogs
are behind the whole thing.

08:14.524 --> 08:16.392
So congratulations.
Mission accomplished.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.628
I'm getting the feeling you didn't
call me in for a high five.

08:18.695 --> 08:20.463
Well, you know that no good deed
goes unpunished.

08:20.531 --> 08:21.831
The brass was so impressed

08:21.899 --> 08:24.167
that they've given us
a follow-up assignment.

08:24.235 --> 08:25.636
They want us to break in

08:25.703 --> 08:28.272
and steal the same file
from Gunther's tablet.

08:28.339 --> 08:29.840
You know the game.

08:29.908 --> 08:31.876
They steal secrets, we steal
secrets -- it's all good fun.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.144
Until
someone gets caught.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.746
Then we don't get caught.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.148
Only one problem.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.654
Heat sensor,
state-of-the-art.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.155
Yeah, Vaxilar's got
a secure room

08:43.222 --> 08:45.291
with these hanging all over
like Christmas lights.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.759
Anybody walks in there with a heat
signature above room temp,

08:47.827 --> 08:48.860
and "Whoop, whoop!"

08:48.928 --> 08:50.395
We should heat up the room.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.764
Maybe it's time
Vaxilar Investments

08:52.831 --> 08:54.899
had an issue
with their A.C. system.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.336
You make it look too easy,
Westen.

09:06.311 --> 09:08.212
Sorry, Fi,
I can't help you.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.914
I'm not really
a big Barry fan anyway.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.516
Well, it isn't Barry.
It's his brother.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.852
His brother? Dear God.
There's two of them?

09:13.920 --> 09:16.454
Yeah, I know.
But he's actually kind of sweet.

09:16.522 --> 09:18.790
Doesn't matter. Elsa's
coming in tonight on the G6.

09:18.857 --> 09:20.124
And I got to prepare
the vessel.

09:20.192 --> 09:22.927
Just hear me out
about Paul's problem.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.896
Jesse combed the company's
employees for suspects,

09:24.963 --> 09:26.297
and we found one
worth talking to.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.466
Sorry, Fi.
Too risky.

09:28.534 --> 09:29.735
Another mojito,
Mr. Axe?

09:29.802 --> 09:31.537
Yes, Edward. Thank you
for asking. Appreciate it.

09:31.604 --> 09:34.206
First-name basis
with the staff, huh?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.441
Well, you know,

09:35.509 --> 09:37.143
being the owner's boy toy
does have its perks.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.344
Now you see why I don't
want to disappoint Elsa?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.946
Oh. Absolutely.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.081
Fi,
what are you doing?

09:43.148 --> 09:44.215
Well,
it's your choice, Sam.

09:44.283 --> 09:45.683
Either I can be
cousin Kelly

09:45.751 --> 09:48.252
here to take you out
to lunch...

09:48.320 --> 09:51.388
or I can be
your hot new fling.

09:51.456 --> 09:54.124
- It's up to you.
- Yes, yes, cousin Kelly. Ha ha!

09:54.192 --> 09:56.626
I'd love to have
a pastrami on rye with you.

09:56.694 --> 09:58.328
Okay, you got me until

09:58.396 --> 10:00.932
Mike's done with his date
with the CIA, and that's it.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.901
<i>In many ways, the more</i>
<i>sophisticated a thief is,</i>

10:03.969 --> 10:06.304
<i>the easier they are to find.</i>

10:06.372 --> 10:08.140
<i>Anyone who gets a job</i>
<i>under a fake name</i>

10:08.207 --> 10:10.476
<i>and uses stolen</i>
<i>high-security access codes</i>

10:10.544 --> 10:13.179
<i>leaves a fat paper trail,</i>
<i>which means, if they're smart,</i>

10:13.247 --> 10:15.982
<i>they have no intention of hanging around.</i>

10:16.050 --> 10:18.151
Ooh, looks like
we're just in time.

10:18.219 --> 10:19.386
Someone's
skipping town.

10:19.454 --> 10:22.389
Yeah. "Someone"
goes by "Griffin Kehl,"

10:22.457 --> 10:23.757
or at least
that's the name he used

10:23.825 --> 10:25.426
to get a janitor job
at Paul's bank

10:25.494 --> 10:27.128
just before
the server went missing.

10:27.195 --> 10:29.397
Oh.
Talk about a career criminal.

10:29.464 --> 10:31.499
Guy's been collecting
warrants in other states

10:31.566 --> 10:32.700
like merit badges.

10:32.768 --> 10:34.669
Armed robbery,
assault, solicitation.

10:34.736 --> 10:36.337
Doesn't sound
like the résumé

10:36.404 --> 10:38.438
of a guy who hacks
secure access codes.

10:38.506 --> 10:40.007
No, my guess
is he's a hired hand.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.341
Okay, wait a second.

10:41.409 --> 10:42.742
You guys dragged me
all the way across town

10:42.810 --> 10:44.510
just to help you twist
some lowlife's arm?

10:44.578 --> 10:48.114
When <i>that's</i>
<i>the lowlife, yeah.</i>

10:48.181 --> 10:49.982
Oh,
somebody call the zoo

10:50.050 --> 10:52.384
'cause a fricking grizzly
just escaped.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.821
Well, grizzly bear or not, we
got to find out who his boss is.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.523
Fi, you got
the lookout?

10:57.590 --> 10:59.891
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll be back.

10:59.959 --> 11:03.395
Yeah. Have fun, boys.
Yeah.

11:03.462 --> 11:06.732
Hey, Griffin.
Oh, you moving again, huh?

11:06.799 --> 11:09.301
Wow. That's like, uh,
three times in eight months.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.303
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.573
Called research, big boy.
Knowledge is power.

11:13.641 --> 11:16.443
You got time
for a chat?

11:19.947 --> 11:22.316
Aah!
Hey!

11:22.384 --> 11:24.719
Fi, get in here!
Watch it!

11:24.787 --> 11:26.721
Grab him!
Try and knock him down!

11:29.025 --> 11:30.392
I'm getting him!

11:30.460 --> 11:31.293
Playtime's over.

11:31.361 --> 11:32.928
Try and hit him!

11:32.996 --> 11:34.397
Ohh! Ow!

11:34.464 --> 11:36.399
Fi, you shot me!

11:36.466 --> 11:38.133
Quit crying.
It's just a beanbag.

11:41.838 --> 11:45.607
Ohh!

11:45.674 --> 11:47.408
Down, boy.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.237
Sam leave
without saying goodbye?

11:56.238 --> 11:58.306
He said he had to get back
to big mama.

11:58.374 --> 11:59.941
Now you feel
like talking?

12:00.009 --> 12:01.643
The hell
do you people want?

12:01.711 --> 12:03.345
We want to know
who you were working for

12:03.412 --> 12:05.547
when you stole a server
from the teachers credit union.

12:05.615 --> 12:07.049
I'm just a janitor.

12:07.116 --> 12:09.317
All right,
we'll keep this simple, Griffin.

12:09.385 --> 12:11.820
Or do you prefer...

12:11.888 --> 12:14.423
Gilbert McCauley?

12:14.490 --> 12:15.924
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:15.992 --> 12:19.127
Look, big man,
you can tell us who hired you,

12:19.195 --> 12:21.429
or you can swallow an armed-robbery
charge in St. Louis.

12:21.497 --> 12:24.766
Or perhaps a nice
attempted-murder in Lexington.

12:24.833 --> 12:25.933
Don't forget Columbus.

12:26.001 --> 12:27.502
It was just
a solicitation charge,

12:27.569 --> 12:29.270
but the girl
was a minor.

12:29.337 --> 12:32.941
Want to come clean
before we start making calls?

12:33.008 --> 12:34.943
Okay, wait. You don't get it.

12:35.011 --> 12:37.747
The lady who hired me --
this chick is vicious.

12:37.814 --> 12:39.815
The last guy
that pissed her off,

12:39.883 --> 12:41.351
she hacked his life
to pieces.

12:41.418 --> 12:43.353
She got his truck repo'd,

12:43.421 --> 12:45.489
she canceled his
sick wife's medical insurance.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.224
She even put him
on a terrorist watch list.

12:47.292 --> 12:48.659
Yes, hello.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.428
Could I speak to
a Detective Ashby, please?

12:50.495 --> 12:52.363
Eve!
Her name is Eve!

12:52.430 --> 12:53.931
She paid me 10 grand
to steal the drive.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.533
You think he's holding out
on us?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.934
You know what?
I think he is. I think he is. Yeah.

12:57.002 --> 12:58.302
We do this sort of thing a lot, Grif.
Mm-hmm.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.304
Okay, okay, okay, fine --
she paid me to steal

13:00.372 --> 13:01.940
some computers
from the warehouse, too.

13:02.008 --> 13:02.974
Oh, how many?

13:03.042 --> 13:05.410
9, 12 -- a-a bunch!

13:05.477 --> 13:07.579
That's it. I swear to God.
Please hang up the phone.

13:07.647 --> 13:11.284
All right, so, what
if we wanted to hire Eve?

13:11.351 --> 13:13.687
Sorry, dude.
She works on referrals.

13:13.754 --> 13:15.488
You got to know somebody.

13:15.556 --> 13:17.157
Well, it's a good thing
we know <i>you.</i>

13:21.630 --> 13:23.965
A dozen computers?

13:24.033 --> 13:26.835
Sounds like
she set up a Beowulf cluster.

13:26.903 --> 13:30.104
Beowulf cluster?
That -- that sounds bad.

13:30.172 --> 13:32.807
It's how hackers
create supercomputers, okay?

13:32.875 --> 13:34.942
They cram a bunch of PCs
into one room,

13:35.010 --> 13:37.110
and they attack
the server's encryption.

13:37.178 --> 13:38.645
You can crack a file
in two days.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.113
We need to find that room.

13:40.181 --> 13:41.247
How long would it take

13:41.315 --> 13:43.082
to cook up an encrypted file
of your own?

13:43.150 --> 13:44.583
An hour, tops. Why?

13:44.651 --> 13:46.285
We're gonna hire Eve
to hack it.

13:46.352 --> 13:47.919
We'll tail her
from the meeting

13:47.987 --> 13:49.922
to wherever she's
decrypting your server.

13:49.989 --> 13:53.392
Her guy told Jesse she gets
10 grand, minimum, for a job.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.728
I don't have
that kind of money.

13:55.796 --> 13:58.632
Well, come on. I mean, now's not the
time to start pinching pennies, Paul.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.368
Oh! What was I thinking? Why didn't I
leave money in the budget for a hacker?

14:01.436 --> 14:05.239
All right, look, um...
Give me a couple of hours.

14:05.306 --> 14:07.842
I can...sell the Prius
and, uh...

14:07.909 --> 14:09.310
- This rolex.
- No, no.

14:09.378 --> 14:12.546
Hey, Paul, come on.
You can't sell dad's watch.

14:12.614 --> 14:13.681
What choice do I have?

14:13.748 --> 14:14.848
People who put their trust
in me

14:14.916 --> 14:16.050
are gonna lose
their life savings.

14:16.117 --> 14:18.018
All right, look, look,
look, look, look.

14:18.086 --> 14:19.486
Save the heirloom
and your little go-kart.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.622
I'll get you the cash,
okay?

14:22.791 --> 14:24.658
When can we get
this meeting?

14:26.128 --> 14:27.261
As soon
as you get the money.

14:29.965 --> 14:33.433
<i>Criminals who specialize</i>
<i>in hacking are a special breed.</i>

14:33.501 --> 14:35.302
<i>They have the skills</i>
<i>to find legitimate work,</i>

14:35.370 --> 14:37.604
<i>but they choose</i>
<i>to steal instead.</i>

14:37.672 --> 14:39.673
<i>They're all about using their</i>
<i>brains to dominate and control.</i>

14:41.775 --> 14:45.545
Domino. That's game, George.
Time to go.

14:45.612 --> 14:48.682
That's enough spanking
for one day.

14:48.749 --> 14:49.583
Go!

14:51.152 --> 14:52.886
<i>That's why crafting</i>
<i>a cover I.D.</i>

14:52.954 --> 14:55.523
<i>that will succeed with them</i>
<i>is a challenge.</i>

14:55.591 --> 14:57.258
<i>They're not looking</i>
<i>for an equal partner.</i>

14:57.326 --> 14:59.194
<i>They're looking</i>
<i>for another loser to sneer at,</i>

14:59.261 --> 15:00.662
<i>so that's just</i>
<i>what you give them.</i>

15:00.730 --> 15:03.632
Well, looky here. If it isn't
my favorite cro-mag, Griffin.

15:06.671 --> 15:07.637
This your friend?

15:07.705 --> 15:09.306
Eve, meet Baxter.

15:09.374 --> 15:10.907
What do you want,
Baxter?

15:10.975 --> 15:11.975
Yeah, nice to meet you.

15:13.844 --> 15:14.877
Hey, yeah, all right.

15:14.945 --> 15:16.813
So, uh, look,
I'm an old-school thief.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.648
You know,
I like things I can touch.

15:18.716 --> 15:20.049
You're a dinosaur.
I can see that.

15:21.752 --> 15:22.818
How do you know each other,
again?

15:22.886 --> 15:24.287
We done jobs.

15:24.354 --> 15:26.222
How many jobs you "done,"
exactly?

15:26.290 --> 15:29.025
Jesus, I told you.

15:29.093 --> 15:31.293
You know, Lexington,
Knoxville, Atlantic City.

15:31.361 --> 15:33.629
Six.
You said six jobs.

15:33.697 --> 15:36.465
Tell them to me again.
Backwards. By year.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.438
I don't know if you're a narc
or just a two-bit amateur,

15:42.506 --> 15:43.539
but I know you're lying.

15:43.607 --> 15:44.774
Meeting adjourned.

15:44.841 --> 15:46.609
Okay, all right,
you got us.

15:46.677 --> 15:49.211
I am a thief, but we ain't
never worked together.

15:49.279 --> 15:52.081
We met in the back of a
police car during a vice sting.

15:52.148 --> 15:54.750
What, were you, like,
swept up chasing jailbait?

15:54.818 --> 15:57.719
All right. Columbus, 2006.
I didn't know.

15:57.787 --> 15:59.221
It's not part of my life
I want to brag about.

15:59.289 --> 16:00.322
So you're a degenerate.

16:02.059 --> 16:04.327
My money still spends.

16:04.395 --> 16:07.898
Bye-bye, Griffin.

16:07.965 --> 16:09.800
I'll bite.
Tell me about your job.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.702
Client came to me.

16:11.769 --> 16:13.871
Hacking job.
Too juicy to pass up.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.940
They want these
financial records

16:16.007 --> 16:18.342
off this
world wide website.

16:18.410 --> 16:20.211
A little out of my league.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.713
Life plans
don't come cheap.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.715
10 grand up front.

16:24.951 --> 16:27.787
$5,000 after,
when I get the file, sweetheart.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.157
Make it another $10,000.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.160
Stay by the phone.
This won't take long.

16:38.096 --> 16:39.730
She's on the move.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.965
Red hair, gray top,
black pants.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.433
Don't get too close.

16:43.501 --> 16:45.401
We've got it covered,
Michael.

16:49.172 --> 16:50.439
Is that her?

16:50.507 --> 16:51.841
Mm-hmm.

16:51.909 --> 16:53.743
That's the first real redhead
I've seen

16:53.811 --> 16:56.112
since I left Ireland.

16:59.016 --> 17:01.117
<i>Vehicle countersurveillance</i>
<i>is very difficult</i>

17:01.185 --> 17:05.054
<i>if you're trying to be</i>
<i>inconspicuous.</i>

17:05.122 --> 17:07.156
<i>If you're willing to be</i>
<i>a little more obvious,</i>

17:07.223 --> 17:09.325
<i>on the other hand,</i>
<i>it gets a lot easier.</i>

17:09.392 --> 17:11.159
<i>You can drive in circles,</i>

17:11.227 --> 17:12.993
<i>go the wrong direction</i>
<i>on a one-way street,</i>

17:13.061 --> 17:15.296
<i>or just stop</i>
<i>in the middle of the road.</i>

17:20.801 --> 17:22.368
Looks like somebody fell asleep
at the wheel.

17:22.436 --> 17:24.671
Keep driving.
She's right there!

17:24.739 --> 17:26.772
She's checking to see
if she has a tail.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.474
If we stick around,
she'll know.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.777
Don't yell at me.

17:39.288 --> 17:42.290
Eve just pulled a stop-and-see.
The girl's tricky.

17:42.358 --> 17:45.561
We're not tailing her anywhere.
Is there a plan "B"?

17:45.628 --> 17:47.262
We're gonna have to
track her digitally

17:47.330 --> 17:48.731
after she hacks the file.

17:48.799 --> 17:50.967
Well, it's lovely that you're
staying so positive, Michael,

17:51.034 --> 17:52.968
but wouldn't that take
government-level resources?

17:53.036 --> 17:54.336
Then I'll have to talk

17:54.404 --> 17:56.505
to someone who has
government-level resources.

18:01.644 --> 18:03.578
I just need to find out
where this hacker is located.

18:03.646 --> 18:05.546
I got it.
But if she's any good,

18:05.614 --> 18:07.615
she's gonna be bouncing
her signal all over the globe.

18:07.682 --> 18:09.516
I'd have to rope in
half a dozen of N.S.A.'s finest

18:09.584 --> 18:10.918
to track her down.
It's worth it.

18:10.986 --> 18:12.553
She's gonna hurt
a lot of innocent people.

18:12.621 --> 18:14.021
Yeah?
<i>I'm</i> innocent people.

18:14.089 --> 18:16.157
If I get busted
using N.S.A. resources

18:16.224 --> 18:18.293
to help a burned spy
with an unapproved mission,

18:18.360 --> 18:19.761
they'll ship me off
to Siberia,

18:19.829 --> 18:22.297
and my wife
hates the snow.

18:22.365 --> 18:23.932
Max, we're talking
about teachers.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.370
Teachers, Max.
Teachers.

18:27.437 --> 18:29.505
Okay, you're gonna lay it on,
aren't you?

18:29.573 --> 18:30.640
Okay,
I'll think about it.

18:30.707 --> 18:32.908
Now, would you focus
on the task at hand?

18:32.976 --> 18:34.609
I don't want this thing
blowing up in my face.

18:34.677 --> 18:38.246
We're sabotaging an A.C. system.
We're not defusing a bomb.

18:38.314 --> 18:41.149
Yeah, well, I've noticed that things have
a tendency to blow up when you're around.

18:41.217 --> 18:44.353
<i>Even the most</i>
<i>security-conscious firms</i>

18:44.420 --> 18:46.855
<i>rarely check their A.C. units</i>
<i>for tampering.</i>

18:46.923 --> 18:49.457
<i>Access the ventilation system,</i>
<i>and with the right hardware,</i>

18:49.525 --> 18:52.693
<i>you can spoil</i>
<i>an enemy's food supply,</i>

18:52.761 --> 18:53.761
<i>sweat out</i>
<i>entrenched combatants,</i>

18:53.829 --> 18:55.696
<i>or just warm an office enough</i>

18:55.764 --> 18:58.032
<i>to make intruders invisible</i>
<i>to heat sensors.</i>

18:59.601 --> 19:02.136
Give it a try.

19:02.204 --> 19:04.472
So long, Jack Frost.

19:04.539 --> 19:06.507
Noon tomorrow,
gonna be a furnace in there.

19:06.574 --> 19:08.709
I'll make sure I wear
something that breathes.

19:08.777 --> 19:09.943
So,
are you done thinking?

19:11.746 --> 19:13.213
Here's the deal.

19:13.281 --> 19:15.883
When the N.S.A. gives me
an address on this hacker lady,

19:15.951 --> 19:17.084
Michael Westen,

19:17.152 --> 19:19.753
soon-to-be-reinstated
agent of the CIA,

19:19.821 --> 19:22.056
goes nowhere
near said address.

19:22.124 --> 19:24.859
Don't worry about it.
I got friends for that.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.244
Huh. I thought
hackers lived in caves.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.580
Well, good news
is Eve is not home.

19:45.648 --> 19:47.783
But the security system for this
complex is pretty top-notch.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.218
I mean, the whole setup
is hardwired.

19:49.285 --> 19:51.353
So nobody's getting in there
without tripping an alarm.

19:51.421 --> 19:54.023
All right, well, let's swing by my
office and pick up some gadgets.

19:54.090 --> 19:55.691
We don't have time
to drive across town.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.393
Okay, well,
if you can't get in clean,

19:57.461 --> 19:59.495
just give the cops something else
to look into while you break in.

19:59.563 --> 20:01.497
That sounds good.
How you gonna do it?

20:01.565 --> 20:04.300
Me? Uh, I'm not
even supposed to be here.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.435
- Why do I get the hard job?
- It was your idea.

20:09.138 --> 20:10.839
Do Porsches
come with tire irons?

20:10.907 --> 20:13.442
<i>One way to break into</i>
<i>a secure building</i>

20:13.510 --> 20:15.611
<i>is to commit a decoy crime</i>
<i>first.</i>

20:15.678 --> 20:17.112
<i>Create an obvious situation</i>

20:17.180 --> 20:19.147
<i>that explains</i>
<i>why an alarm was tripped,</i>

20:19.215 --> 20:21.816
<i>and people won't discover</i>
<i>the real reason you stopped by.</i>

20:35.866 --> 20:37.834
I don't see any computers.

20:37.902 --> 20:40.270
Okay, Fi,
the boys in blue are here.

20:40.338 --> 20:42.172
You two got to get the server
and get out.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.307
It's not here.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.677
Then grab what you can
and go.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.612
<i>When you don't have time</i>
<i>for a thorough search,</i>

20:47.680 --> 20:50.782
<i>the next best option is to take</i>
<i>what you can on your way out.</i>

20:50.850 --> 20:52.317
Wait a minute. Bingo.
Here we go.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.386
<i>But if you don't want anyone</i>
<i>to know you were there,</i>

20:54.454 --> 20:55.720
<i>you're limited</i>
<i>to things they won't miss.</i>

20:55.788 --> 20:57.088
Take these.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.223
Open your purse.
We're gonna take this with us.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.124
<i>Like trash.</i>

21:02.027 --> 21:03.694
Okay, let's go.

21:14.371 --> 21:16.146
<i>People tend to think</i>
<i>shredding documents</i>

21:16.147 --> 21:17.914
<i>is the same</i>
<i>as destroying them.</i>

21:17.982 --> 21:19.582
<i>Actually, it's more like</i>
<i>taking the pieces</i>

21:19.650 --> 21:21.684
<i>from a hundred different Jigsaw</i>
<i>puzzles and mixing them up.</i>

21:21.752 --> 21:23.086
<i>Putting them back together</i>

21:23.153 --> 21:25.288
<i>is just a matter of time</i>
<i>and perseverance</i>

21:25.356 --> 21:27.690
<i>or having access</i>
<i>to the right software.</i>

21:27.758 --> 21:28.858
Not too shabby, huh?

21:28.926 --> 21:30.594
I pieced together
a take-out receipt,

21:30.662 --> 21:32.563
some junk mail,
and a partial phone bill.

21:32.630 --> 21:35.733
Yay. Now we know Eve likes
the moo shu chicken at Yee's

21:35.801 --> 21:38.269
and she's on the
500 minutes-a-month plan.

21:38.337 --> 21:40.104
Uh, we know a little more
than that, Spiky.

21:40.172 --> 21:41.439
I used a connection
at work

21:41.507 --> 21:43.408
to pull her text messages
from her phone.

21:43.476 --> 21:46.245
She's been I.M.'ing some guy named
Dean Myers like he's a new B.F.F.

21:46.313 --> 21:49.114
Dean Myers, as it turns out,
runs a syndicate out of Atlanta.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.017
Not a guy you'd normally find
on your friends-and-family plan.

21:52.085 --> 21:53.619
Check this one.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.522
"The cake will be ready
for the bake sale by Sunday."

21:56.590 --> 21:58.491
Something tells me she's not talking
about raspberry cheesecake.

21:58.559 --> 21:59.792
Oh!

21:59.860 --> 22:01.327
She's almost done cracking
my server.

22:01.394 --> 22:03.362
We'll get it off her hands
before she can sell it.

22:03.430 --> 22:04.730
How? You said
Eve was untrackable.

22:04.798 --> 22:06.098
Who said anything
about tracking?

22:06.165 --> 22:07.366
She's gonna walk Mike
right to it.

22:07.433 --> 22:09.468
He's meeting Eve to pay
for the file she hacked,

22:09.535 --> 22:11.537
and then she's gonna hire her
to decrypt it.

22:11.604 --> 22:14.273
The chances are she'll use the same
network she's got working on your server.

22:14.341 --> 22:16.008
Genius.
You see, bro?

22:16.076 --> 22:17.711
Told you
they're rock stars.

22:17.779 --> 22:21.648
Hey, uh,
you need your bills paid?

22:25.753 --> 22:27.287
Ah.

22:27.355 --> 22:29.390
Clever girl.

22:29.458 --> 22:31.893
I guess good looks aren't
the only thing God gave you.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.227
Shut it, creeper.

22:33.295 --> 22:35.864
20 grand buys you a hacked file,
not a hand job.

22:35.931 --> 22:37.065
How about a smile?

22:37.133 --> 22:39.234
Guess not.

22:40.169 --> 22:44.239
Surely 50 grand
will thaw the ice queen.

22:45.942 --> 22:47.442
$50,000? For what?

22:47.510 --> 22:49.945
This file ain't
gonna decrypt itself.

22:50.013 --> 22:52.181
Decrypt
is a six-figure word.

22:52.248 --> 22:53.215
100 g's it is.

22:53.283 --> 22:54.984
I like a girl
who knows her worth.

22:55.052 --> 22:56.418
There's
just one condition.

22:56.486 --> 22:58.087
I need to be there
when it happens.

22:58.155 --> 23:00.990
No, uh, I need to watch you
"Run the decryption,

23:01.058 --> 23:03.360
crack the code,
and forge the system."

23:03.428 --> 23:04.862
You mean
purge the system.

23:04.929 --> 23:06.764
Yeah, if that means erase,
then yeah, I do.

23:06.831 --> 23:09.800
Fine.
Start next week.

23:09.868 --> 23:11.902
These aren't exactly
patient men.

23:11.969 --> 23:15.372
Would another $50,000 put me
at the top of your to-do list?

23:15.439 --> 23:17.440
Maybe, but I don't make
a single keystroke

23:17.508 --> 23:19.542
until all the money's
in an escrow account.

23:19.610 --> 23:21.144
Yeah, I'll call you
when it's there.

23:21.212 --> 23:25.415
And, Eve, I'm really looking
forward to that first stroke!

23:25.482 --> 23:26.349
Perv.

23:30.553 --> 23:32.554
Fi, plan's in motion.

23:32.622 --> 23:33.722
Let's go to work.

23:38.862 --> 23:41.363
Wow.

23:41.431 --> 23:44.167
I love the patchwork
curtains, Fi.

23:44.234 --> 23:45.868
I got to tell you,

23:45.936 --> 23:49.039
I am totally digging this
new vibe you got going here.

23:49.107 --> 23:50.541
How's Mikey taking it?

23:50.609 --> 23:53.010
He's getting used to it.
Change is a process.

23:53.078 --> 23:54.378
Yeah. Well, you know
what else is a process.

23:54.446 --> 23:55.713
Putting an imaginary
$150,000

23:55.781 --> 23:58.182
into an escrow account
in under two hours.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.853
But, uh, that's what you
asked for, my Celtic princess.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.055
And these
magical fingers, they delivered.

24:03.123 --> 24:05.925
So, what are you making?
A remote-detonated incendiary bomb

24:05.992 --> 24:07.859
with a thermite core.

24:07.927 --> 24:09.861
Mmm, love it
when you talk dirty.

24:09.929 --> 24:12.531
Um, I'm sorry. How does a bomb
get my server back?

24:12.598 --> 24:13.898
Well, getting it back
is the goal,

24:13.966 --> 24:16.134
but Eve's been cracking
that server for two days.

24:16.201 --> 24:18.736
We need to make sure there's
nothing left in her system.

24:18.803 --> 24:20.504
Okay, but is all this stuff
really necessary?

24:20.572 --> 24:22.506
She knows what she's doing, man.
Show some gratitude.

24:22.573 --> 24:24.274
I'm being grateful.

24:24.342 --> 24:26.109
I just want to make sure
innocent people don't get hurt,

24:26.177 --> 24:28.812
a concept I'm not at all
surprised you find confusing.

24:28.879 --> 24:30.547
- Boys...
- The only thing that I find confusing

24:30.615 --> 24:32.883
is that you keep questioning
my friends.

24:32.951 --> 24:35.953
- They know what they're doing. Trust me.
- I'm working here.

24:36.021 --> 24:37.855
You know what I can count on
when you say, "trust me"?

24:37.923 --> 24:39.457
Something bad happening.

24:39.525 --> 24:40.892
Ow!
Ow!

24:40.960 --> 24:42.728
Now, if I make one mistake

24:42.795 --> 24:45.197
inserting this blasting cap,
we all die a fiery death.

24:45.265 --> 24:47.934
So shut up and let me work.

24:48.001 --> 24:50.503
Getting me in trouble,
man.

24:51.938 --> 24:53.272
I can't tell you
how glad I am

24:53.340 --> 24:55.174
you two were able to
get out here on a Saturday.

24:55.242 --> 24:57.342
'Cause if I don't get this
sweat lodge fixed by tomorrow,

24:57.410 --> 24:58.576
they're giving me
the boot.

24:58.644 --> 25:00.011
Well, you're
in good hands, sir.

25:00.079 --> 25:02.013
If hell
does ever freeze over,

25:02.080 --> 25:04.648
it'll be because the devil
called us to fix his A.C.

25:04.716 --> 25:06.149
Could take a while,
though.

25:06.217 --> 25:07.417
So, uh,
we got this covered

25:07.485 --> 25:09.453
if you want to enjoy
the rest of your weekend.

25:09.521 --> 25:11.422
No, I think it'd be best
if I stuck around, actually.

25:11.490 --> 25:14.091
We got a pretty strict
security policy here.

25:14.159 --> 25:16.394
<i>When in the field, it's the</i>
<i>little things that kill you --</i>

25:16.462 --> 25:20.666
<i>a getaway car that won't start,</i>
<i>a jammed gun that won't fire,</i>

25:20.734 --> 25:22.034
<i>or a maintenance man</i>
<i>who won't leave.</i>

25:22.102 --> 25:23.936
Do you smell that?

25:24.004 --> 25:26.606
<i>When setbacks happen, you improvise.</i>
<i>What?</i>

25:28.876 --> 25:30.510
Wait.
You don't think...

25:30.577 --> 25:31.645
Guys,
is everything okay?

25:31.712 --> 25:33.814
No, everything
is not okay.

25:33.881 --> 25:34.848
We got
a trioxylene leak here.

25:34.916 --> 25:36.917
Trioxylene?
W-what's that?

25:36.985 --> 25:39.186
It's a silent killer created
when natural gas

25:39.254 --> 25:41.221
mixes with the freon
from the A.C. unit.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.071
We gonna be okay?

25:42.096 --> 25:43.321
Jean, I need you to get
to the gas shut-off valve

25:43.324 --> 25:45.659
and turn it off
while we seal these vents.

25:45.726 --> 25:47.527
Can you do that?
Can you do that, Jean?!

25:52.333 --> 25:54.368
Trioxylene gas?

25:54.436 --> 25:56.203
I once convinced
a Turkish diplomat

25:56.271 --> 25:59.007
his house was filled
with methylchloridium.

26:01.577 --> 26:05.147
It's hot enough in there to hide
us from the thermal sensors.

26:05.214 --> 26:06.615
I hope so,
or we're gonna have

26:06.682 --> 26:08.350
an international incident
on our hands.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.785
I guess we're good.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.921
Wow.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.823
Talk about cocky.

26:15.891 --> 26:19.493
Stolen computer
filled with trade secrets,

26:19.561 --> 26:21.395
and the Frenchies
leave it out in the open.

26:23.098 --> 26:25.232
Okay.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.300
Now we wait.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.142
Hey, how's your
little hacker hunt going?

26:36.210 --> 26:37.778
I'm wrapping it up
after this.

26:40.648 --> 26:42.683
Don't worry,
I won't be making a habit

26:42.751 --> 26:44.852
of asking for these kind of favors.
No, no, no, no.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.920
Ask away.

26:46.988 --> 26:50.858
I mean, the answer
might not always be yes, but...

26:50.925 --> 26:52.860
I'm happy to help.

26:52.928 --> 26:54.929
Whenever I can.

27:02.436 --> 27:05.905
All right,
let's get the A.C. back on

27:05.973 --> 27:08.607
before the maintenance man
has a nervous breakdown.

27:09.910 --> 27:11.544
There it goes.

27:16.484 --> 27:18.752
<i>It's important</i>
<i>to keep your guard up</i>

27:18.819 --> 27:20.253
<i>at the end of an operation.</i>

27:20.321 --> 27:21.822
<i>Once you've found your target,</i>

27:21.890 --> 27:23.658
<i>won their trust,</i>
<i>and made a deal,</i>

27:23.725 --> 27:26.160
<i>it's natural</i>
<i>to want to relax a bit.</i>

27:26.228 --> 27:27.229
Hop in.

27:27.296 --> 27:31.099
Keep your hands
to yourself.

27:31.166 --> 27:34.102
<i>But the fact is, that's exactly</i>
<i>the time to be most careful.</i>

27:34.170 --> 27:36.304
<i>When money's on the line</i>
<i>and things go wrong,</i>

27:36.372 --> 27:39.107
<i>they tend to go very,</i>
<i>very wrong.</i>

27:39.175 --> 27:40.041
Aah!

27:41.543 --> 27:42.977
What -- what did --

27:43.045 --> 27:45.312
laced a needle
with ketamine.

27:45.380 --> 27:48.081
I've heard it works fast,
but wow.

27:48.149 --> 27:50.717
Uh...Uh...

27:53.021 --> 27:54.855
Shut up.
You're pathetic.

27:54.922 --> 27:58.425
I dug into that escrow account
you set up. It was a fake.

27:58.493 --> 28:01.728
You picked the wrong bitch
to cross.

28:09.705 --> 28:12.307
Look who's up.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.910
I've been thinking
about that escrow account.

28:14.977 --> 28:16.712
Very well done.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.881
Since we both know

28:18.948 --> 28:20.917
something like that's
out of your league...

28:20.985 --> 28:22.218
Oh!

28:22.286 --> 28:23.753
...Have to wonder...

28:31.729 --> 28:34.430
...Who are you
working for?

28:34.498 --> 28:35.898
<i>When someone's</i>
<i>in a killing mood,</i>

28:35.966 --> 28:37.767
<i>it doesn't help appealing</i>
<i>to their sympathy.</i>

28:37.834 --> 28:39.268
<i>You're better off</i>
<i>taking their rage</i>

28:39.335 --> 28:40.902
<i>and redirecting it</i>
<i>at someone else.</i>

28:42.371 --> 28:46.407
Dean Myers! Dean Myers!

28:47.543 --> 28:49.010
What the hell
did you just say?

28:49.078 --> 28:50.645
I said...

28:50.713 --> 28:52.847
Dean Myers.

28:52.915 --> 28:55.550
That's insane.

28:57.053 --> 29:01.190
Come on, sweetie.
We both know he's your buyer.

29:01.258 --> 29:03.060
I've worked with Dean
for years.

29:03.127 --> 29:06.531
He told me to steal
a server

29:06.598 --> 29:08.866
before he landed
from Atlanta.

29:08.934 --> 29:12.936
You weren't supposed to know
he was behind it.

29:13.004 --> 29:14.805
Son of a bitch!

29:18.910 --> 29:22.246
Well,
I guess you failed.

29:22.313 --> 29:24.281
Know what that means?

29:24.349 --> 29:25.649
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait!

29:25.717 --> 29:27.084
You wouldn't --
I'm just an employee!

29:27.152 --> 29:28.586
You wouldn't shoot a gardener,
would you?

29:28.653 --> 29:30.421
If you want to hurt someone,
hurt him.

29:30.488 --> 29:31.455
I can help you.

29:31.522 --> 29:32.589
How?

29:32.657 --> 29:34.524
Rob him.
Use my crew.

29:34.592 --> 29:35.592
Your crew?

29:35.659 --> 29:37.326
We can set a trap.

29:37.394 --> 29:39.729
You say the word,

29:39.796 --> 29:42.098
and we'll steal
his money and the files.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.334
You and me.

29:46.070 --> 29:48.004
Correction.

29:48.071 --> 29:49.171
I get the money.

29:49.239 --> 29:51.607
I get the files.

29:51.674 --> 29:54.376
You get your life.

29:54.443 --> 29:56.277
Unless something
goes bad.

29:57.946 --> 30:00.481
Then you get a bullet
in your head.

30:09.305 --> 30:10.739
He should have called
by now.

30:10.807 --> 30:11.706
You think
something went wrong?

30:13.609 --> 30:15.277
I know
something went wrong.

30:15.344 --> 30:16.978
Look who's here.

30:17.046 --> 30:19.747
This seat taken?
No?

30:19.815 --> 30:21.415
Thank you.

30:25.653 --> 30:28.555
Chuck Finley,
I presume.

30:28.623 --> 30:29.957
Have we met?

30:30.025 --> 30:33.462
No, but Baxter told me
all about you -- all of you --

30:33.529 --> 30:35.998
so let's not pretend
like you don't know who I am.

30:36.066 --> 30:37.433
What'd you do with him?

30:37.501 --> 30:40.203
Oh, sweetie.

30:40.271 --> 30:43.140
He didn't mention
you were his girlfriend.

30:43.207 --> 30:45.943
He's a total pervo,
by the way.

30:48.546 --> 30:50.513
So, uh...
Where is he?

30:50.581 --> 30:52.416
He's taking
a ketamine nap.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.551
We made a deal.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.255
I agreed to let him live.
He agreed to work for me.

30:57.322 --> 31:00.057
Which means
you all work for me.

31:00.124 --> 31:01.825
Pretty cool, huh?

31:01.893 --> 31:04.928
You're still going to be robbing
somebody, but it won't be me.

31:04.995 --> 31:07.497
We speak to Baxter first,

31:07.564 --> 31:09.899
or you can go to hell...
Sweetie.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.243
Be here tomorrow...

31:19.311 --> 31:21.712
Eat a good breakfast,
and bring your "A" game.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.515
If you screw this up,
Baxter won't be okay.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.253
In fact, he won't <i>be.</i>

31:41.200 --> 31:43.635
So, this is where the wicked witch
of the web does her thing, huh?

31:43.703 --> 31:45.204
Nice view.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.973
The second she lets down
her guard, we take her out.

31:49.643 --> 31:53.145
Uh, Fi, that's a Glock 26
with a hair trigger.

31:53.213 --> 31:54.747
We move now, Mike's going home
in a body bag.

31:54.815 --> 31:57.516
So, what? We just take her word
that she's gonna let him go?

31:57.584 --> 31:59.685
No, we play this thing out until
we get our chance, damn it.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.121
You wanted to see Baxter --
feast your eyes.

32:02.189 --> 32:03.255
No touching.

32:03.323 --> 32:04.890
I hear
there's a change of plans.

32:04.958 --> 32:08.294
Cheer up, guys. It's gonna be
like taking candy from a baby.

32:08.362 --> 32:11.263
My buddy Dean is on his way.
He doesn't know we're here.

32:11.331 --> 32:12.731
And he doesn't even know
we're gonna hit him.

32:12.799 --> 32:15.601
Load the money and
the computers -- everything --

32:15.669 --> 32:17.103
into baby doll's truck.

32:17.170 --> 32:19.839
And then boom --
it's go time.

32:19.907 --> 32:22.976
Okay, reunion's over.

32:23.043 --> 32:24.677
We've got guests
to get ready for.

32:27.582 --> 32:28.682
"Boom -- it's go time."

32:28.749 --> 32:30.116
Am I crazy,
or does it sound

32:30.184 --> 32:32.285
like Mike still wants us
to blow up the computers?

32:32.353 --> 32:35.088
No, I think he just gave us a
way to get him out of this alive.

32:35.156 --> 32:39.559
Man wants fireworks...
I'll give him fireworks.

32:39.627 --> 32:41.194
<i>When you operate in the field,</i>

32:41.262 --> 32:42.962
<i>you expect your cover</i>
<i>to be tested.</i>

32:43.030 --> 32:44.497
<i>To stay alive,</i>

32:44.565 --> 32:46.299
<i>you keep your facts straight,</i>
<i>your lies simple,</i>

32:46.367 --> 32:48.101
<i>and try not to come</i>
<i>face to face</i>

32:48.169 --> 32:49.669
<i>with someone</i>
<i>you've never met...</i>

32:49.737 --> 32:51.872
Eve! Hello?!

32:51.940 --> 32:53.541
<i>...But are</i>
<i>already supposed to know.</i>

32:53.608 --> 32:56.011
Anybody here?!

32:56.078 --> 32:57.812
Yeah, we're here.
<i>But when that's unavoidable,</i>

32:57.880 --> 33:01.050
<i>you stare the stranger in the eyes...</i>
<i>We're all here.</i>

33:01.118 --> 33:03.887
<i>...And sell your relationship</i>
<i>with everything you've got.</i>

33:03.955 --> 33:06.389
She busted us, Deano.
Who's this guy?

33:06.457 --> 33:10.394
That fake escrow account
you set up didn't work.

33:10.461 --> 33:13.597
Fake escrow account?
Who the hell are you?!

33:13.665 --> 33:16.333
After all the jobs I did,
all the money I made for you,

33:16.401 --> 33:17.634
<i>this</i> is how you thank me?

33:17.702 --> 33:20.304
You try to screw me?
Screw you --

33:20.372 --> 33:21.872
Baxter told me everything.

33:21.940 --> 33:24.375
You hired him
to steal the drive from me.

33:24.443 --> 33:26.377
You're crazy!
I don't even know this Baxter!

33:26.445 --> 33:28.046
Look, I got all your money
right here!

33:32.018 --> 33:34.219
Oh, so you didn't know me
when you flew me

33:34.287 --> 33:37.257
up to Atlanta
and offered me this gig?

33:37.324 --> 33:39.492
You make it a habit
of depositing 20 g's

33:39.560 --> 33:41.361
in the accounts
of total strangers,

33:41.429 --> 33:42.596
or is it my lucky day?

33:42.664 --> 33:43.864
Dean, this is a setup.

33:43.932 --> 33:46.267
Not a good idea.

33:46.334 --> 33:48.235
Allow me, gentlemen.

33:48.303 --> 33:50.570
Get on the ground.

33:50.638 --> 33:52.139
Whatever they told you,
they're lying.

33:52.206 --> 33:55.241
Get on the ground.
All the way down. Let's go.

33:55.309 --> 33:58.211
You had to get greedy.
It's a shame, really.

33:58.278 --> 34:01.846
Put the server, the computers,
and the money in my Jeep now.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.616
Eve, you're making
a big mistake.

34:04.684 --> 34:07.185
God damn it, listen to me!
Enjoy your stay.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.221
The ocean's
only a few steps away.

34:09.288 --> 34:11.356
And there's nobody around
for miles,

34:11.424 --> 34:12.992
so there won't be anyone
to bother you.

34:13.059 --> 34:14.427
Oh.

34:14.495 --> 34:17.297
But that means nobody
will be here to hear you scream.

34:17.364 --> 34:18.764
You can't do this
to us.

34:20.701 --> 34:21.801
Eve!

34:21.869 --> 34:24.605
Eve!

34:24.672 --> 34:25.906
We wait any longer,

34:25.974 --> 34:28.242
she's gonna turn this
into a mass execution, man.

34:28.310 --> 34:30.844
If we start shooting,
Mike catches the first bullet.

34:30.911 --> 34:32.645
Toss the hand cannons in,
too.

34:34.415 --> 34:36.815
Hold up.
I have one more.

34:44.523 --> 34:47.725
Take these.
You three, over there.

34:49.562 --> 34:50.728
Shut it.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.398
Did I tell you?
My crew would deliver.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.368
Yeah, good job, crew.
Now, zip-tie your hands.

34:57.570 --> 35:00.005
That's it. Teamwork.

35:03.443 --> 35:06.312
On your knees, please.

35:06.380 --> 35:09.515
It's now or never, Fi.
We got to take our chances.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.651
- Blow the bomb.
- He's too close. We do it now, he dies.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.153
Well, it's nice
working with you, Evie.

35:14.221 --> 35:15.354
Actually,
there's one more thing.

35:15.422 --> 35:17.322
Remember that part about

35:17.390 --> 35:19.991
me letting you live if
you helped me rip off my buyer?

35:21.160 --> 35:23.194
I lied.
Easy, girl.

35:23.262 --> 35:26.064
It's time for you to ride off
into the sunset, sweetheart.

35:26.131 --> 35:28.365
You got the money,
you got the computers.

35:28.433 --> 35:29.800
Fi, push the button.

35:29.868 --> 35:32.303
Come on, Michael.
Few more steps.

35:32.370 --> 35:34.071
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't have to kill me.

35:34.139 --> 35:35.973
I know. But I <i>want</i> to.

35:36.041 --> 35:38.810
If you're gonna do it,
then not in the face, please.

35:38.877 --> 35:42.113
Please not the face!
Not the face.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.082
I don't want
a closed casket!

35:54.660 --> 35:57.463
You remember the part

35:57.530 --> 35:59.832
about <i>me</i> helping <i>you</i> get away
with the money and the drive?

36:01.535 --> 36:02.736
<i>I</i> lied.

36:10.545 --> 36:12.913
- What do you say we get the oysters?
- I'm allergic to shellfish.

36:12.980 --> 36:14.481
Really? Still?

36:14.549 --> 36:15.682
Still.

36:15.749 --> 36:17.817
Hi, Fi.
Boys.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.351
Your server.

36:19.419 --> 36:20.686
Uh...

36:20.754 --> 36:22.054
Wow.

36:22.121 --> 36:23.421
Yeah, I would tell them

36:23.489 --> 36:25.090
you had a small electrical fire
or something.

36:25.157 --> 36:27.225
You know, be creative.

36:27.292 --> 36:29.661
So, what happened to Eve?

36:29.729 --> 36:32.531
Well, we blew up her Jeep,
hogtied her, called the police.

36:32.598 --> 36:33.966
She'll have a lot
of explaining to do.

36:35.435 --> 36:37.603
Thank you.
You guys saved my life.

36:37.671 --> 36:38.871
Thank your brother.

36:38.939 --> 36:41.007
He's bailed us out
more than once.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.876
If it weren't for him,
we wouldn't be here to help you.

36:42.943 --> 36:44.711
Ah.
Really?

36:44.779 --> 36:46.480
Why do you act
so surprised?

36:46.547 --> 36:49.182
I know it's hard to get
past the ridiculous hairstyle

36:49.250 --> 36:52.151
and the multiple piercings
and the man-purse...

36:52.219 --> 36:53.519
And the wrist cuffs.
Hey.

36:53.587 --> 36:56.088
Fi loves the wrist cuffs.
Am I right, sweetie?

36:56.156 --> 36:58.524
Barry, I'm saying nice things.
Don't make me shoot you.

36:59.959 --> 37:02.160
Don't take family
for granted.

37:04.797 --> 37:06.631
Thanks, Barry.
I mean it.

37:06.698 --> 37:10.868
Fiona, I heard Michael's
distributor was on the Fritz.

37:10.936 --> 37:12.670
This should work
with a '73 Charger.

37:12.737 --> 37:16.006
I'm a bit of a car guy
myself.

37:16.074 --> 37:17.808
I will put it
to good use.

37:17.875 --> 37:20.277
Hey, Fi, have Mike thank
his CIA friends for me.

37:20.345 --> 37:21.912
I have spent
my entire career

37:21.979 --> 37:24.147
avoiding the reach
of the U.S. government,

37:24.215 --> 37:26.650
and I can't believe
they saved this guy's butt.

37:26.717 --> 37:29.452
You're just lucky he's working
with one of the good guys...

37:29.520 --> 37:30.653
Who's actually a good guy.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.860
I don't mind that.
Mnh-mnh.

37:38.928 --> 37:41.796
<i>Once the bullets have stopped</i>
<i>flying and the mission is over,</i>

37:41.864 --> 37:44.098
<i>the least-glamorous part</i>
<i>of a spy's work begins --</i>

37:44.166 --> 37:45.633
<i>the debriefings.</i>

37:45.701 --> 37:48.803
<i>They're lengthy sessions</i>
<i>to analyze mission strategy</i>

37:48.871 --> 37:51.173
<i>And discuss operational facts</i>

37:51.240 --> 37:53.041

<i>into the field reports.</i>

37:53.109 --> 37:56.045
<i>Not the most exciting way</i>
<i>to spend a Sunday afternoon,</i>

37:56.113 --> 37:59.415

38:04.522 --> 38:05.889
Max!

38:05.957 --> 38:07.458
Max!

38:11.563 --> 38:13.798
What happened?

38:13.865 --> 38:16.934
What happened?
Did this to you?

38:17.002 --> 38:18.236
Who did this to you?

38:18.303 --> 38:19.737
My...

38:19.805 --> 38:22.606
M-my w-wife's
gonna be pissed.

38:24.609 --> 38:26.710
Say goodbye for me.
No.

38:26.778 --> 38:28.012
Stay with me, Max.

38:28.079 --> 38:30.080
No, no, no.

38:30.148 --> 38:31.615
Max.

38:31.683 --> 38:32.617
Max!

38:57.744 --> 38:59.278
Fi, somebody shot Max.

38:59.346 --> 39:00.580
The police are on the way,

39:00.647 --> 39:02.215
and I think I'm holding
the murder weapon.

39:02.283 --> 39:03.383
What? Who shot him?

39:03.450 --> 39:05.418
I don't know,
but they fired blanks at me.

39:05.486 --> 39:07.620
Why would someone shoot at you
with blanks?

39:07.688 --> 39:09.689
I think they're framing me
for Max's murder.

39:09.757 --> 39:11.825
How soon can you get here?

39:18.630 --> 39:20.164
<i>To secure a location,</i>

39:20.165 --> 39:22.699
<i>police clear rooms one by one</i>
<i>from the ground up.</i>

39:22.767 --> 39:25.034
<i>It's a thorough procedure</i>
<i>but slow.</i>

39:25.102 --> 39:28.104
<i>It gives you the opportunity</i>
<i>to cover your tracks,</i>

39:28.171 --> 39:31.207
<i>wipe down fingerprints,</i>
<i>pick up any shell casings,</i>

39:31.275 --> 39:33.476
<i>and steal</i>
<i>the office access logs.</i>

39:33.543 --> 39:35.478
<i>But it only leaves one option</i>
<i>for escaping.</i>

39:38.349 --> 39:41.318
<i>So when your back's against the</i>
<i>wall and time is running out,</i>

39:41.385 --> 39:44.455
<i>there's nothing like seeing</i>
<i>an old friend.</i>

39:58.036 --> 40:00.337
<i>Rescue line launchers</i>
<i>are standard gear</i>

40:00.405 --> 40:01.939
<i>for most Coast Guard,</i>

40:02.006 --> 40:04.074
<i>mountain rescue,</i>
<i>and tactical-assault teams.</i>

40:04.142 --> 40:07.177
<i>They use compressed air</i>
<i>to throw a line up to 400 feet.</i>

40:07.245 --> 40:09.513
<i>Not the type of equipment</i>
<i>you use very often,</i>

40:09.581 --> 40:12.516
<i>but when you need it,</i>
<i>you really need it.</i>

40:12.583 --> 40:13.616
<i>Anyone who's ever</i>
<i>climbed rope in gym class</i>

40:13.684 --> 40:16.086
<i>knows you can't just slide down</i>

40:16.154 --> 40:18.155
<i>if you want any skin</i>
<i>on your hands</i>

40:18.223 --> 40:20.091
<i>by the time</i>
<i>you get to the bottom.</i>

40:41.678 --> 40:43.145
Fi --

40:43.213 --> 40:44.980
Not now.
Get to the car.

40:53.388 --> 40:55.690
Why would anyone kill Max
and frame you for it?

40:55.758 --> 40:58.460
- I don't know.
- You think it has something to do

40:58.528 --> 41:00.529
with you asking him
to help you track Eve?

41:00.597 --> 41:03.265
There's no way. Something
like that takes time to plan.

41:03.333 --> 41:04.734
The guy you saw,
was there any --

41:04.801 --> 41:08.304
It was too fast.
I missed him.

41:08.372 --> 41:10.206
Well, we're not
gonna recover anything

41:10.274 --> 41:12.976
from this key-card log.

41:13.044 --> 41:15.245
I covered my tracks...

41:15.312 --> 41:17.914
So I covered the tracks
of the killer.

41:17.982 --> 41:19.615
Your only other option
was a murder charge.

41:19.683 --> 41:21.150
It's not your fault.

41:21.217 --> 41:22.351
Well, it's official.

41:22.418 --> 41:24.052
Someone's
trying to frame you.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.887
I found this
little parting gift

41:25.955 --> 41:28.056
on the car
that you took to Max's office.

41:28.124 --> 41:30.892
Brand-new box
missing 13 bullets.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.861
Two that killed Max,
two I shot into the wall,

41:33.929 --> 41:35.996
and I bet the rest
are in here.

41:36.064 --> 41:37.999
Mike, did Max say anything
before he...

41:38.067 --> 41:40.167
I mean,

41:40.235 --> 41:42.170
anything that can help us
figure out who did this?

41:42.237 --> 41:46.207
He said to say goodbye
to his wife.

41:46.275 --> 41:48.376
Michael, we have to do
something about that gun.

41:48.444 --> 41:51.812
Yeah, and we need to get an
alibi for you like right now.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.715
Are you listening, brother?
We got to get in front of this.

41:53.782 --> 41:56.350
I know.

41:56.418 --> 41:57.885
I know.

42:04.342 --> 42:06.242
Let's go to work.
