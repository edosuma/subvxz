(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:45.320 --> 00:46.800
RYAN: We're never gonna find one.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.030
DOCTOR: Course we are!

00:48.120 --> 00:50.237
I've programmed
the detector specifically.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.993
I found seven last time I was here.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.576
GRAHAM: And how long did that take you?

00:53.600 --> 00:55.480
DOCTOR: It couldn't have been
more than a month.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.111
Unless that was Seffilun 59.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.995
Which one is this?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.309
Seffilun 27.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.400
Maybe 59's the one
with the big pile of these.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.597
That's the problem with junk galaxies,

01:06.680 --> 01:08.990
all the planets look the same,
it's hard to keep track.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.118
If we've wasted the last four hours
on the wrong planet...

01:12.200 --> 01:15.989
Oi, who took you rainbathing
in the upward tropics of Kinstarno?

01:16.080 --> 01:17.958
Oh, no, no. Listen, that was amazing.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.351
I was just saying,
like needle, haystack.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.399
Yeah, you might be right.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.630
(BUZZING)

01:24.720 --> 01:26.757
No, hold on. I've found something.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.790
(WHIRRING)

01:29.880 --> 01:31.553
(GASPS)

01:31.720 --> 01:32.790
I'm sorry.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.190
YASMIN: What's he found?

01:34.600 --> 01:35.716
Nobody move.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.638
If I can keep it in temporal lock.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.071
No, there's too many sensors,
it won't work.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.555
It was camouflaged.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.677
This is someone's idea of a nastyjoke.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.353
- What is it?
- Sonic mine.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.830
It's counting down.

01:49.920 --> 01:50.920
(BEEPING FASTER)

01:51.000 --> 01:53.196
- How long have we got?
- Three, two...

01:59.240 --> 02:00.674
WOMAN: I can't find their med tags.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.256
This is how rubbish I am at this.
You'd think it'd be simple enough.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.671
MAN: Mabli, stop beating yourself up.
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
(GASPS)

02:08.759 --> 02:11.878
It's all right. You're safe.
Just don't make any sudden moves.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.872
Your body will take
a moment to catch up.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.919
Can you point out your med tag for me,
I can't find it anywhere.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Where are we?

02:18.080 --> 02:21.016
We're in hospital. They've just brought
us all round. You're the last one up.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.440
YASMIN: We don't have med tags.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.792
Oh, it wasn't my mistake.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
Told you.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.640
Except you must have.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.634
We need your full bio. History,
allergies, fluid levels, life-span data.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.600
Basically, to help us avoid killing you.
Take it slow.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.036
There was...

02:38.120 --> 02:39.120
A sonic mine.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.192
Yeah, the robot dredgers notified us

02:41.280 --> 02:42.776
as they were pulling you
from the debris.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.376
We've stabilised your vital organs.
You're lucky they got to you first.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.153
Stabilised my organs?
What happened to them?

02:47.240 --> 02:49.080
I've seen quite a few
sonic mine injuries here.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.277
They disrupt
your internal organic stability

02:51.360 --> 02:53.317
whilst churning up
the exterior environment.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.629
Tsuranga is actually agitating

02:54.720 --> 02:56.576
for the territories
to be swept more fully, but...

02:56.600 --> 02:58.557
(BEEPING)

02:58.960 --> 03:00.553
That doesn't make sense.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.551
- Tsuranga.
- GRAHAM: What have they done?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.234
I know that name.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.150
(GASPING)

03:09.640 --> 03:11.871
Where have I heard the name "Tsuranga"?

03:12.880 --> 03:14.439
Whatever. I'm very grateful.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.949
Need to get back to our ship.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.838
(GROANING) Come on, you lot.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.080
- MAN: Hey, come back.
- Which way is out?

03:20.280 --> 03:22.431
Can you return
to the assessment zone, please?

03:22.520 --> 03:24.557
We're not discharging you.
You need to rest.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.871
Well, I appreciate
how much you've looked after us,

03:27.560 --> 03:30.632
but my ship is very valuable.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.071
It's also my home. Our home.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.679
And I'm worried about leaving it here,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.357
on a junk planet
where people come and scavenge.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.270
I might never see it again.
And I've only just got it back.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
Wait here.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.310
This way out.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.754
Whether you agree or not,

03:46.840 --> 03:48.957
it is my responsibility
to protect the general.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.635
I understand
your responsibilities, Ronan.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.080
Okay, I hear about them endlessly.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.880
Says the man who never wants
any of his own.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.120
Sorry.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.237
Looking for the exit. There's no signs.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.960
General Cicero's privacy indicators
are clearly on.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.600
Sorry, we're not really up
on privacy indicators.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.717
General Cicero? Not Eve Cicero?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.996
Keeba galaxy? Neuro Pilot?

04:09.160 --> 04:11.072
You're mentioned
in the Book of Celebrants.

04:11.160 --> 04:14.039
You helped defeat the Army of the Aeons
at the Battle of the Underkind.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.476
I was one of many.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.959
You're a bit of a legend though.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.350
This is my brother, Durkas,
and my consort, Ronan.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.036
When she says consort,
she really means clone drone. Android.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.634
You can tell by the hair.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.720
Durkas.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.071
- And who are you?
- I'm the Doctor.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.519
Wait, I've heard that name.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.353
Aren't you in the Book of Celebrants?

04:33.440 --> 04:34.736
Isn't there a whole chapter about you?

04:34.760 --> 04:35.830
Me? No.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.036
Very common name.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.918
Anyway, lovely chatting, must be off.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.434
Hope you all get better soon.

04:42.840 --> 04:46.390
I'd say it was more of a volume
than a chapter.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.750
Just so you know.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.240
Oh, that bit hurts.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.710
Oh, that bit really hurts.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.110
Where is the exit?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.510
Why are there no signs for the exit?

04:59.480 --> 05:01.870
- Hi. Very sorry. Looking for the exit.
- Hello.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.256
Somebody needs to have a big rethink
on the signage in this building.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.634
I'd do it myself, but I need...

05:05.760 --> 05:07.160
(GROANING)

05:08.200 --> 05:10.431
My ectospleen hurts.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.273
I can feel it resettling.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.113
Oh, you're the sonic mine lot.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.600
It sounded pretty serious.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.000
- How're you feeling?
- Rough.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
What are you in for?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.520
Pregnant.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.551
Blimey, yes you are.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
Almost ready to pop.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.035
How did you get like that?

05:26.480 --> 05:30.997
On holiday, got involved with someone,
didn't take precautions. Like an idiot.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.719
So, what's that? Nine months?

05:32.800 --> 05:33.800
No, last week.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.712
- Last week?
- Oh, you're a Gifftan?

05:35.880 --> 05:38.156
Male pregnancies last a week.
Very intense.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.799
Yeah, feels like forever.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.075
I'm a day overdue.

05:41.160 --> 05:44.597
They're thinking they might induce me
at Resus One, otherwise...

05:45.400 --> 05:47.232
Well, it wouldn't be good
for either of us.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.640
You're here. Look, you can't
keep disturbing all the other patients.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.155
Astos, found them.
They're here in Pod Two.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.920
We need to go now.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

05:54.960 --> 05:55.960
We'll be thinking of you.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.716
What do you mean "go"?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.029
How're you gonna do that?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.790
- What do you mean?
- We have been trying to tell you.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yes.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
You have.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.315
Vibrations.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.193
Too wrapped up in myself.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.830
Missed the vibrations.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.593
I was trying to break it to you gently.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.875
Tsuranga.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.637
This isn't a hospital,

06:23.240 --> 06:24.390
it's a ship.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.879
And we're already in flight.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.395
ASTOS: Tsuranga operates
emergency medical transport.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.073
This is a quad zone rescue craft.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.754
Like the Red Cross.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.911
You'll be fine.
We'll be at Resus One soon enough.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.720
- How long were we out for?
- ASTOS: Four days.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.553
Four days flight from the TARDIS.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.320
I'm walking.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
(GROANING)

06:43.800 --> 06:44.916
No need to walk with me.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.560
I need to walk on my own.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.752
Four days. Walking.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.196
Come on, limbs.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.760
Have you got onboard teleport?

06:51.840 --> 06:54.753
No, but there's post-recuperation
onward teleport at Resus One.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.230
I don't wanna go to Resus One.
Let me talk to the pilot.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.560
Hey, it's not just you onboard.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.634
What are you doing? Don't touch that.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.856
Patients aren't allowed access

07:01.880 --> 07:03.997
to any on board systems
or non-medical facilities.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.230
What were you worried about?

07:06.040 --> 07:07.520
Just as I was waking up you...

07:07.960 --> 07:09.792
You saw something and you were worried.

07:09.880 --> 07:10.880
No.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.595
Ooh. Bad liar.
Must be difficult in your job.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.114
Hey, I'm an excellent liar.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.271
- So, you were lying then?
- I didn't say that.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.238
See? Bad liar.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.153
Nav chamber. This way.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.477
(GROANING) Still hurts!

07:25.000 --> 07:27.469
Running can disrupt
the ongoing internal healing process.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.513
Enough now. You can't be in here.
I don't know what that device is,

07:33.600 --> 07:35.336
but if you don't leave
I have to restrain you.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.635
Where is the crew?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.916
Rescue crafts are automated.
It's a two-medic crew,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.071
just me and Mabli.
Our course is remotely programmed

07:41.160 --> 07:42.753
from the Tsuranga hub at Resus One.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.115
How do we turn it around?

07:44.200 --> 07:46.999
We can't.
The course is remotely set and locked.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.976
The onboard crew don't have privileges
to unlock it.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.320
We'll see about privileges.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.392
Don't! If you interfere
with the navi system

07:52.480 --> 07:54.517
they'll take it
as an active hostility or hijack.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.829
They can detonate the craft.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.036
I'm not being hostile!

07:57.120 --> 07:59.589
Yes, you are!
You are being hostile and selfish.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.616
There are patients onboard
who need to get to Resus One

08:01.640 --> 08:02.756
as a matter of urgency.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.038
My job is to keep all of you safe.
You are stopping me from doing that.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.480
You're right.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.275
Of course, you're right.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.400
Sorry.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.757
That mine hit me harder than I thought.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.718
I've done 37 tours.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.754
We will get you back safe.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.909
Where are we?

08:32.480 --> 08:33.994
There's a lot of stuff out there.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.308
Space junk, asteroids...

08:35.400 --> 08:36.976
We're on the edges
of the Constant Division,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.558
that's what threw me back there.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.240
The routine usually
keeps us out of here.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.999
- Why?
- It's disputed territory.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.278
We're only just over the boundary
so nothing to worry about.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.396
So, what's that?

08:46.480 --> 08:47.480
What's what?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.314
Not sure.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.269
(CRASHING)

08:59.800 --> 09:00.950
Probably an asteroid shower.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.753
(RAPID BEEPING)

09:03.840 --> 09:04.840
Shield breach.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.480
No, wait. Reconfiguring.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.990
Resealed and solid.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.640
But something breached it for a second.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.594
(THUDDING)

09:12.040 --> 09:14.509
(THUDDING CONTINUES)

09:16.440 --> 09:17.954
I'll check the system monitors.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.159
(THUDDING)

09:26.720 --> 09:28.473
Something is inside the shields.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.280
I'm sure it's nothing.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.635
Bad liar, Astos.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.475
Go back to your patient pod.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.590
I don't know your name.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.716
I'm the Doctor.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.878
- Are you kidding?
- Sometimes.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.880
But not right now.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.310
Tell me the ship's structure, Astos,
as quick as you can.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.240
Central walkway goes all the way around.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.856
We have an assessment area in the heart,

09:46.880 --> 09:48.960
three patient pods,
one emergency suite on the sides.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.680
We can perform
limited medical procedures,

09:50.760 --> 09:52.336
but our job is basically,
keep people alive

09:52.360 --> 09:53.616
till we can get them to a facility.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.869
Evacuation equipment?

09:54.960 --> 09:56.553
Two LifePods, port side and starboard.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.109
Maximum five per pod.
We're just within our occupancy limit.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
Oh, that's good.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.278
This ship was designed
for 100,000 tours.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.616
It can withstand a hell of a lot.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.393
Are you trying to reassure me
or yourself?

10:05.520 --> 10:06.954
(THUDDING AND BEEPING)

10:07.760 --> 10:10.673
- That's a breach alert.
- It's in the port side LifePod.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.752
- It can't be.
- Are there comms in the LifePod?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.115
(STATIC)

10:15.200 --> 10:16.200
(THUDDING)

10:19.480 --> 10:21.096
It's using the LifePod
as a way into the ship.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.794
You know these territories.
What can it be? Whoa!

10:23.880 --> 10:25.314
That thing can really move.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.256
It's heading from the port side
to the starboard.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.616
Area around the starboard pod's
offline, I can't get a reading.

10:29.640 --> 10:30.676
We have to take a look.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.396
Okay. You take port,
I'll check starboard.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.520
No, no, no. Too dangerous.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.080
You take port, I'll take starboard.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.200
You're not in charge here.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.358
This is my craft, you are my patient
and my responsibility.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.176
As is everyone else here.
You're still recovering.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.395
You're still in pain.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.870
I'll check starboard,
you check port side.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.080
I don't like being told what to do.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.160
Yeah.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.634
I'm getting that impression.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.515
Take a comm dock.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.840
Mabli already has one.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.037
Stay off her channel
while we work out what this is.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.456
She doesn't need to know about this yet.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.630
It's only her second tour.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.016
Neither do any of the other patients.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.269
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.919
Why am I trusting you, Doctor?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.159
You might be a bad liar, Astos,

11:08.400 --> 11:09.914
but you've got excellent instincts.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.715
Did you just buzz me?

11:12.800 --> 11:14.480
I'm requesting
further adrenaline blockers.

11:14.520 --> 11:15.670
- What, already?
- Yes.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.076
Let me check with Astos.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.595
No, you must supply them without delay.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.616
But we only carry a limited stock.
I'm not sure I'm allowed to.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.960
The panels are down this way.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.350
You know our status
and how Keeba Central regard us.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.272
We would not
ideally register a complaint

11:28.360 --> 11:30.113
against someone
so early in their career.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.274
Let's get them, then.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.749
I think that's staff only.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.589
Yeah.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.634
(SIGHING) I'm trying to figure out
what to do next.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.393
Deny everything or...

11:55.200 --> 11:56.600
Ask you to turn a blind eye?

11:56.680 --> 11:58.797
I see your problem. Yeah.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.789
Generally, truth is always
your best option.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.754
I was trying to hack
into my sister's medical records.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.356
Well, we've all hacked
into our loved ones confidential records

12:10.440 --> 12:12.113
at one stage or another, haven't we?

12:12.560 --> 12:13.560
(SCOFFING)

12:13.640 --> 12:14.869
Can I ask why?

12:15.600 --> 12:17.193
Well, she's lying to me.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
About...

12:19.280 --> 12:20.600
About what's wrong with her.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.238
She might have good reason for that.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.116
I know the reason.
She's a control freak.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.634
Even to her own little brother.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.440
The most decorated General
in Keeba history,

12:32.680 --> 12:36.833
907 days in continual flight,
on residual energy.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.192
Fighting the Ayonians,
saving our species.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.274
So, what do you do then?

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
Me, I'm...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
- Engineer.
- Oh.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.560
Yeah.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.958
I have to fix the things
pilots like my sister tend to wreck.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.520
And she looks down on me for it.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.270
And she always will.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.634
(DOCTOR PANTING)

this thing is, it can move very fast.</i>

13:18.240 --> 13:20.040

13:20.440 --> 13:22.238
The power has gone out in this section.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.510

It's jettisoning the pod.

I don't know.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.314
But it's incredibly dangerous.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.594
It jettisoned the LifePods.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.840
And it killed Astos.

Got that, thanks, Graham.

How is it eating all that stuff?

What even is it?

16:26.680 --> 16:27.796
No idea.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.556
Hit the ship from the depths of space,

16:30.760 --> 16:32.513
so it can survive a vacuum.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.240
It doesn't need oxygen.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.919
And can digest pretty much whatever
it wants, by the looks of things.

I've already been in here with Astos.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.114
Has he really gone?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.435
I'm sorry, Mabli.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.560
He was one of the only people
who ever believed in me, including me.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.868
He was so kind.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.473
There aren't enough kind people.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.914
What would he want you to do now?

Right. Yeah.

- I can.
- What did you want to show us?

17:37.960 --> 17:41.078
Well, if I sync my ocular recorders
with the data banks...

17:41.160 --> 17:43.800
Oh, yeah, sync
the old ocular recorders, it's obvious.

No, you're all right.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.600
Oh, go on, please.
Both of you, quick. It's kicking.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.239
Come on, it'll be nice to share it.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.120
Oh, wait for it.

20:14.920 --> 20:15.990
Wait for it.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.720
Oh!

20:19.920 --> 20:20.920
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.157
See? He likes you guys.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.320
Oh, and again.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.080
You know it's a boy?

20:26.160 --> 20:27.160
Of course, it is.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.994
Boys give birth to boys,
and girls give birth to girls.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.117
- That's how it is.
- Not where we come from.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.953
Ugh, how does that work?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.279
Do you wanna see my baby pics?

20:37.880 --> 20:40.270
We all need to be in the assessment area
in six minutes.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.080
Ha!

20:44.440 --> 20:45.874
One hour.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.873
Three hours.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.519
End of the first day.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.156
Mid second day.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.993
And, oh...

20:54.960 --> 20:56.235
Three hours ago.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.360
Mate...

21:00.560 --> 21:02.153
You're growing a person.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.920
Yeah.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.720
I couldn't do that.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.634
No, he really couldn't do that.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.360
Yeah.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.955
Almost seems a shame to give him away.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.595
That's what you're gonna do?

21:17.880 --> 21:20.270
Oh, I'm not fit to raise a kid.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.831
Besides, dark times right now.
Turbulent world.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.798
I'm not sure I'm his best option.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.198
I can't even operate my oven.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.360
But...

21:31.480 --> 21:32.755
Won't you miss him?

21:38.440 --> 21:41.239
Six minutes you said? I'll be there.

21:41.880 --> 21:42.880
Yeah.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.434
RYAN: He's the same age as my dad
must have been when he had me.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.633
Same age as I am now.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.952
Never really thought about it like that.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.117
I wouldn't be able to cope
having a kid now.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.719
When was the last time you saw your dad?

22:04.120 --> 22:05.120
A year ago.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.594
Didn't go well.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.354
Got angry with him.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.315
Why?

22:13.200 --> 22:14.998
He ducked out when I needed him.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.556
He's like a gap in my life.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.479
Even at Nan's funeral.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.200
Do you mind me asking?

22:26.440 --> 22:28.113
How did your mum die?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.000
(SIGHING)

22:35.120 --> 22:36.679
Washing up in the kitchen,

22:37.960 --> 22:39.838
massive heart attack, just...

22:41.000 --> 22:42.593
Just out on the floor.

22:42.960 --> 22:43.960
God.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.680
Who found her?

22:49.200 --> 22:50.200
Me.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.600
How old were you?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.070
Thirteen.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
Ryan,

23:02.760 --> 23:04.114
I'm so sorry.

23:04.680 --> 23:05.716
I never knew.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.589
I never knew life
threw that sort of stuff at you.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.319
I never knew that when it does,
sometimes adults don't cope either.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Your dad.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.320
I get it.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.154
He loved her too.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.711
People always said
that I looked like her.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.473
He must have found that hard.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.950
Why am I even talking
about this? (SCOFFS)

23:37.080 --> 23:38.958
Come on.
Four minutes to the briefing.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.360
DOCTOR: Too fast to chase and capture.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.875
Too toxic to touch directly.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.035
It's a bit of a puzzle.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.336
It's gonna kill us all, isn't it?

23:47.360 --> 23:48.656
Oh, Mabli,
you went there way too quick.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.353
I said a puzzle, not a death sentence.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.600
I mean,

23:52.040 --> 23:55.750
it's a bit of a challenge,
and I can't quite see the solution yet,

23:55.840 --> 23:57.593
but that's life. Or medicine.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.158
Patients present problems,

24:00.240 --> 24:02.960
you figure them out
and come up with solutions.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.953
That's what this is,
a problem to be diagnosed.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.992
Medicine to be administered.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.316
You're a medic, I'm the Doctor.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.400
A doctor of medicine?

24:11.480 --> 24:13.278
Well, medicine, science,

24:13.360 --> 24:15.556
engineering, candy floss,

24:16.120 --> 24:21.036
Lego, philosophy, music,
problems, people, hope.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.156
Mostly hope.

24:22.240 --> 24:24.118
I'm struggling to see much hope here.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.554
It doesn't just offer itself up,
you have to use your imagination.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.270
Imagine the solution,
and work to make it a reality.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.194
Whole worlds pivot
on acts of imagination.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.954
So, what are you imagining now?

24:38.320 --> 24:40.835
Broadly, I'm imagining
that thing off this ship.

24:40.920 --> 24:45.358
Specifically, I'm trying to imagine
the answer to the question.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.480
What does it want?

24:47.560 --> 24:48.760
Does it have to want anything?

24:48.840 --> 24:51.116
Every living thing,
from the tiniest to the largest,

24:51.200 --> 24:54.034
wants something. Food, survival, peace.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.873
But, the first thing it did
was kill Astos.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.696
That must be what it wants to do
to all of us.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.736
You know there's a much faster way
back to Resus One.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.513
Why is it routing us this way?

25:01.600 --> 25:05.879
Asteroid field. Fast moving asteroids
all around, really unpredictable.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.156
(ALARM BUZZING)

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
What are these?

25:09.920 --> 25:11.400
They are bad.

25:11.480 --> 25:15.269
This craft has over 5,000
different scan sensors,

25:15.400 --> 25:17.119
constantly feeding back to Resus One.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.398
They monitor everything,
both internally and externally.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.154
Check the routing is stable,
and there are no hostile forms,

25:23.240 --> 25:24.560
however microbial, on board.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.711
The systems have detected the Pting.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.440
They are asking us to confirm or deny
anything is wrong.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.637
We can't take a creature like that
back to Resus One.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.320
There's thousands
of vulnerable patients.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.576
And if we confirm it's onboard?

25:34.600 --> 25:35.840
They will recommend evacuation.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.956
But we can't evacuate.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.874
It goes straight to RST,
remote structural termination.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.120
They destroy the ship.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.560
Right.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.231
Nothing wrong. We're fine.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.800
We can't keep doing that.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.536
Three dismissals
and they don't believe you.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.233
Precautionary detonation.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.079
Oh, great. Who designed that?

25:58.160 --> 26:00.436
So, this ship either gets destroyed
by that creature,

26:00.520 --> 26:02.193
or by control from Resus One.

26:02.720 --> 26:03.720
Yeah.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
Sorry.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.829
(GRUNTS)

26:17.520 --> 26:19.560
You're probably wondering
why I called you all here.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
Sorry.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.150
Bit Poirot!

26:25.280 --> 26:29.069
I need to bring you all up to speed,
very directly, very succinctly.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.669
I can't sugarcoat this.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.991
- Where's the chief medic?
- Gone.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.039
Killed by an alien organism
called Pting that's come onboard.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.112
Very fast moving, very deadly,

26:38.200 --> 26:40.056
and it's eating its way
through the structure of the ship.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.720
Also, and this is the bit
you need to work on not panicking.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.675
It has jettisoned the LifePods.

26:44.760 --> 26:45.910
Oh.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.598
I'm the Doctor, these are my friends,

26:48.680 --> 26:51.320
Ryan, Graham and Yaz.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.357
You know Mabli, our very capable medic.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.911
We will pool all our brilliance
and get us all safely to Resus One.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.513
I thought there'd be more questions.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.834
I've encountered a Pting before,
it massacred my fleet.

27:11.440 --> 27:12.440
Okay.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.600
What did you learn about them?
What do they want?

27:14.640 --> 27:16.233
They kill, relentlessly.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.714
(RYAN GASPS)

27:20.200 --> 27:22.271
MABLI: It must have got
to the central systems.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.156
That means we'll soon lose
oxygen and heat.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.360
EVE: It'll go for whatever
is powering the craft next.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.993
We're on an anti-matter drive.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.072
We could use
stazers to defend ourselves.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.800
They can stun it briefly.
Got any onboard?

27:32.840 --> 27:34.513
A couple, I think, in here.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.674
If we're gonna live through this

27:36.800 --> 27:39.600
- protect the anti-matter drive.
- Protect the anti-matter drive. Snap!

27:40.720 --> 27:43.110
Can we get to Resus One
any faster than currently routed?

27:43.280 --> 27:45.317
Not without breaking
the ship's auto routing,

27:45.400 --> 27:47.551
which would send a signal back
to Resus One.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.393
And they go straight
to Hostility Protocols.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.279
I could create a false
positive route signal to send back.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.397
But there's no manual controls
in the nav chamber.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.119
- Show us.
- General...

27:56.200 --> 27:57.200
Shush now, Ronan. I know.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.936
We could go past the drive chamber
on the way.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.758
Durkas with me. Please?

28:00.840 --> 28:03.719
Um, is this a bad moment

28:03.800 --> 28:05.440
to mention my internal fluids
have broken?

28:05.800 --> 28:06.950
I think the baby is coming.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.150
Really sorry.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.751
The BirthBud is set up
in your PatientPod.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.230
- Let's get you back there.
- But it won't have any power.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.232
It's got a backup generator,
no need to panic.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.440
Would you two be my Dhulas?
I haven't got any Dhulas.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.398
- Do what?
- Dhulas, birth partners.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.677
She's brilliant,
but I need some men with me.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.196
- Yeah, we're blokes, aren't we?
- Yeah.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.876
- Yeah, yeah. All over it. Yeah.
- Come on.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.277
Right, now I'm imagining
you're sorting all this out?

28:37.360 --> 28:40.034
Me too. Be cautious,
it could be anywhere.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.480
Come on.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.841
- MABLI: You're fine.
- I need another adrenaline blocker.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.872
You used the last one, General.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.960
Everything okay?

28:48.880 --> 28:50.758
- Yeah.
- With me, please.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.016
Where do you think it is right now?

28:56.040 --> 28:57.040
I don't know.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.715
Can't trace it,
since the diagnostic systems drained.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.752
Doctor, quick word. Private.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.960
Catch you up, go on.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.078
Eve Cicero, her condition.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.152
- What about it?
- Patient confidentiality,

29:10.240 --> 29:11.469
I can't discuss with you,

29:11.560 --> 29:13.640
but if you're a doctor,
maybe you should examine her.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.200
I've got to go.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.874
Sorry, where are we?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.474
Oh, anti-matter drive.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.636
What century is this?

29:23.840 --> 29:26.309
- You're joking?
- No, we travel in time.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.039
- Are you joking now?
- No.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.437
- Sixty-seventh.
- Oh, nice century.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.760
Bit tricky in the middle.
Turns out all right in the end.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.270
See this, Yaz? Anti-matter drive.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.272
Oh, I did a bit
on anti-matter at school.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.432
Never quite understood it.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.798
The thing with anti-matter is you
either have to find it or generate it.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.920
That's what this bit does.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.553
Particle accelerator.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.075
Like at CERN. We did that in physics.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.118
No, but the thing at CERN is massive.

29:51.200 --> 29:54.830
In your time, generating anti-matter
cost a massive amount of money.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.639
This is progress.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.519
Things get smaller, faster and cheaper.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.956
This is like the iPhone version
of CERN.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.829
Accelerating enough particles
to power this entire craft.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.040
So, how does it work?

30:07.360 --> 30:10.114
The particle accelerator
smashes the atoms together,

30:10.280 --> 30:13.796
like a little anti-matter factory
to produce positrons.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.874
Which are then stored very carefully
inside electric and magnetic fields.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.589
The positrons interact
with the fuel materials

30:20.720 --> 30:23.235
to produce heat, which produces thrust.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.313
It's pretty old school, this one.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.956
It's beautiful.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.754
Anti-matter powering
the movement of matter,

30:30.960 --> 30:33.714
bringing positrons into existence

30:33.920 --> 30:36.196
to move other forms of life
across space.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
I love it.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.360
Conceptually,

30:40.280 --> 30:41.714
and actually.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.555
Yaz, you have to keep this safe
from the Pting.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.234
If this drive gets destroyed,

30:47.320 --> 30:50.597
this ship will lose propulsion,
will drift endlessly while the Pting...

30:50.680 --> 30:52.956
I get it. It won't be good.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.470
Ronan can stay with you.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.310
No. General, my responsibility is to...

30:57.400 --> 30:59.710
Ronan, you're able to touch it
without it toxifying you.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.076
That's useful to all of us,
including me.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.280
Of course, General.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.597
You might need this, med blanket.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.440
Sterilised barrier.
67th century technology.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.159
In case you need to pick anything up.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.355
(THUDS)

31:22.000 --> 31:23.878
(ALARM BUZZES)

31:24.040 --> 31:25.315
(DOCTOR GASPING)

31:26.880 --> 31:28.280
Pting presence denied.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.760
Strike two, one left.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.116
Now, you two, see? A more direct route.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.840
Obviously, fast moving asteroids
and debris to avoid on the way,

31:34.920 --> 31:37.196
which is presumably
why the systems wanted to avoid it.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.478
Now, if I can rig up a cover signal
back to Resus One...

31:40.560 --> 31:42.153
Doctor, I'm a Neuro Pilot,

31:42.240 --> 31:44.675
my expertise is
in symbiotic neuro-piloting

31:44.760 --> 31:46.877
pulse systems at a push, but not this.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.560
Oh, I can make a rig
out of this chamber.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.640
No, you can't.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.638
You would't be able to make your way
through those asteroids even if I did.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.271
Yeah? Says you.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.837
- How long have I got?
- Literally, no time at all.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.355
Give me some space to work.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.998
Siblings... Bless.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.879
Why are you on this ship, General?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.760
Corton fever.
Contracted on my last duty.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.194
Can't quite shake it.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.715
What are you doing?

32:18.640 --> 32:22.634
Why would you be using
adrenaline blockers for Corton fever?

32:23.160 --> 32:24.416
How'd you know about the blockers?

32:24.440 --> 32:25.856
Your slow pulse, my really good hearing.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.234
You asked Ronan for some.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.834
It isn't Corton fever, is it?

32:30.480 --> 32:31.709
Is it Pilot's Heart?

32:33.080 --> 32:35.151
I'm sorry, Eve,
but if we're gonna survive this,

32:35.520 --> 32:37.273
you need to be honest with me.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.920
I started as a Pulse Pilot.

32:46.080 --> 32:49.790
I graduated to Neuro Fleet Commander
faster than anyone in Keeban history.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.395
I'm the most decorated general.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.834
I'm the poster woman.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.110
I cannot have Pilot's Heart.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.592
I cannot be that example to others.

32:59.680 --> 33:03.515
But you have, and you have been using
more and more blocker shots

33:03.600 --> 33:04.670
to get through the day.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.035
Trying to control

33:06.280 --> 33:08.715
the surges of adrenaline
around the heart.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.873
One big surge could kill me.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.510
Does Durkas know?

33:14.040 --> 33:15.080
I don't want him worrying.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.879
He's gonna find out sooner or later.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.189
DURKAS: He already has.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.559
Not that he's surprised, just...

33:23.280 --> 33:24.509
Disappointed.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.198
- Durkas...
- We don't have time now.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.837
I've rigged a primitive piloting bypass,

33:29.920 --> 33:31.991
- combining pulse and neuro...
- I'll do it.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.955
Ever flown that way?

33:34.080 --> 33:35.080
No.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.296
But you can talk me through it.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.880
It takes people a dozen years to train.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.277
I really need to spend more time
in 67th century.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.919
I know how to do this.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.196
I'm not stopping now.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.240
Everyone is going to live. Including me.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.400
(GROANING)

33:51.040 --> 33:53.794
- Breathe deep, cockle.
- I am breathing.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.997
Oh, this really hurts!

33:56.080 --> 33:57.080
Yoss. Yoss.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.194
I'm giving you some stronger
pain management, it should help.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.074
(YOSS SCREAMING)

34:02.440 --> 34:03.874
Yeah. Yeah, that's better.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.397
Where's the BirthBud? Is it running?

34:06.480 --> 34:08.072
No, backup generator isn't working.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.514
(SCREAMING) What?

34:09.679 --> 34:12.070
I can't do this without a BirthBud!

34:12.159 --> 34:14.356
- Yoss, don't panic, mate.
- I am panicking.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.880
Which is why I'm telling you not to.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.875
Listen to your Dhulas.

34:17.960 --> 34:18.960
We're here for you.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.319
I don't even know you! Who are you?

34:22.400 --> 34:23.896
You're not the one about to have a baby

34:23.920 --> 34:27.311
you don't want, on a ship
without a BirthBud.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.056
- (GROANS)
- The baby is ready to come out.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.196
Oh, God.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.600
Oh. (GRUNTING)

34:40.679 --> 34:42.034
It's close.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.476
Just focus on protecting
the anti-matter drive.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.478
(SCREAMING)

34:51.920 --> 34:53.149

- (GROWLING)

35:17.840 --> 35:19.911
I'll get it as far away
from the drive as I can.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.080
Be fast, the stun power
will only last a few seconds.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.110
Siobhan Chamberlain
with a goal kick for England.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.198
(CHITTERING)

35:31.720 --> 35:33.234
Okay, it's rigged.

35:33.320 --> 35:37.030
I've leeched some system power
off the anti-matter drive.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.589
Now if they can keep that
up and running,

35:40.080 --> 35:42.800
we'll have enough power
to keep basic systems going

35:42.880 --> 35:44.314
and still get to Resus One.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.279
That's if that thing
doesn't get in there

35:47.640 --> 35:49.279
and drain the energy.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.835
This isn't gonna work.

35:50.920 --> 35:51.956
Keep quiet, General.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.237
Trust your engineer

35:54.320 --> 35:55.674
and tell me you're well enough.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.514
I'm well enough.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.399
Now promise me that's true.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.198
You're gonna need every scrap
of energy you have.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.037
Cover signal transmitting to Resus One.

36:12.120 --> 36:15.113
Hopefully, bit of luck, they're still
gonna think they're in control.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.040
Durkas.

36:19.720 --> 36:20.995
You're a genius.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.238
The energy.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.195
It doesn't wanna kill us,
it doesn't care about us.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.954
It wants the systems,
it wants the power.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.875
It didn't go for Astos,
it went for the life-support systems

36:32.960 --> 36:34.314
in the LifePod.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.199
It drained the lights and the power
and my sonic,

36:37.280 --> 36:41.559
it drains everything it eats.
That little creature seeks out

36:41.640 --> 36:44.280
and feasts on energy.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.637
That's why it homed-in on us here,

36:46.760 --> 36:49.434
pulsing with it in the wilds of space.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.160
Locked in, General.

36:51.560 --> 36:52.676
Try it out.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.435
I can see the course.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.799
I need to increase speed.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.198

How is it?

37:36.040 --> 37:37.235
Rough.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.230
But it'll work.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.592
Take us in safely, General.

when we get to Resus One?

37:56.040 --> 37:58.271

Nothing to worry about,
I'll deal with the Pting.

Well, how are you gonna do that?

38:10.960 --> 38:12.189
Yes.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.520
Maybe, maybe...

38:17.080 --> 38:19.072
It's me, I'm not a Pting.

38:19.720 --> 38:20.870
It was here.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.630
I got rid of it.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.759
- But it'll be coming back.
- What is the situation elsewhere?

38:25.840 --> 38:27.035
Eve's piloting the ship.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.873
Durkas is maintaining
controls and signals.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.077
You're guarding

- (EXPLOSION)
- (RUMBLING)

38:32.520 --> 38:35.558
Mabli, Graham and Ryan
are presumably delivering Yoss's baby.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.758
And the bomb's going to detonate.
I'm just going to move it away

38:38.840 --> 38:39.910
from this room.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.480
- Mind helping?
- Yes!

38:43.800 --> 38:45.359
(GASPS) Clever sonic.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.715
Self-rebooting.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.435
There's a bomb in this room?

38:48.520 --> 38:49.749
Right in here.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.996
Mabli said that Resus One
would terminate the ship

38:53.080 --> 38:54.376
if they found the Pting on board.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.400
How would they do that?
We're too far for missiles.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.600
Has to be the same
for every Tsurangan rescue craft.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.754
It's built in.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
Self detonation.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.400
Bingo.

39:04.480 --> 39:07.280
Ten points for Yasmin Khan, and yes,
I am keeping score for all of you.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.720
Ronan, up your game.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.430
Jokes.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.680
So...

39:16.680 --> 39:18.239
You're interfering with the bomb?

39:18.320 --> 39:20.551
- Yes.
- Is it going to detonate?

39:20.640 --> 39:21.710
Yes.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.075
What will you do?

39:24.160 --> 39:25.514
Speed it up.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.114
To save our lives.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.229
Are you also experiencing
comprehension deficiency?

39:31.640 --> 39:34.030
Oh, every day right now, mate.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.760
Need to be so careful,

39:36.840 --> 39:38.354
tiny little device.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.392
Could blow us all to pieces.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.551
And I'm going to set it off.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.190
Ronan.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.354
Keep guard.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.711
Yaz, come on.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.236
Resus One in sight.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.073
We join the route
back in at this point,

39:59.160 --> 40:00.400
they won't know we've deviated.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.149
You okay?

40:02.640 --> 40:06.520
All those times
I thought I was going to die in battle,

40:06.800 --> 40:09.793
that you'd get a dispatch
and hear about it.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.600
I always felt so bad.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.555
But now...

40:14.400 --> 40:15.675
I'm glad you're here.

(RUMBLING)

40:20.280 --> 40:21.714
(GRUNTING)

40:26.440 --> 40:27.556
Funny.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.200
I'm normally the one defusing the bomb.

40:30.640 --> 40:31.960
(GRUNTS)

40:35.840 --> 40:37.593
(BEEPING)

40:38.840 --> 40:40.832
Pick a number
between one and a hundred.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.070
Fifty one.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.152
Pentagonal number! Interesting.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.676
Get in that corner.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.309
What was the number for?

40:52.400 --> 40:54.710
Number of seconds before
the bomb goes off.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.359
I moved it forward a bit.

40:56.440 --> 40:57.556
What?

40:57.640 --> 40:58.835
I would've gone higher.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.640
Good number 51,
atomic number of antimony.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.349
The number of federalist papers
written by Alexander Hamilton.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.955
I love that show,
I've seen all 900 casts.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.076
(BEEPING)

41:10.600 --> 41:13.115
I'm giving you more gas, Yoss,
this will relax you.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.237
I've never been less relaxed
in all my life.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.152
I do not want to do this.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.038
Hey, hey, we're all here for you,
aren't we?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.309
Too right.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.593
Oh, yeah, I've seen every episode
of <i>Call the Midwife.</i>

41:24.680 --> 41:26.896
And he's descended from
an old Earth nurse, it's in his blood.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.376
- Every episode?
- Yeah, it's bang on,

41:28.400 --> 41:30.296
see whilst you've been mucking around
on YouTube,

41:30.320 --> 41:32.312
I've been learning useful life skills.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.880
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

41:35.040 --> 41:36.599
I'm really trusting you on this bomb,

41:36.680 --> 41:37.736
but I don't know what you're doing.

41:37.760 --> 41:41.959
Think of the Pting as a mouse
and the bomb as a piece of cheese.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.360
A very large piece of cheese

41:43.440 --> 41:45.193
about to explode
and take us all with it.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.616
It's not the perfect analogy,
I'll admit.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.080
You could've picked a bigger number.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.039
Where is it? Come on.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.880
So how do we do this then?

41:51.960 --> 41:53.880
Really straightforward,
cut open his stomach sac,

41:53.960 --> 41:55.110
reach in, remove the baby.

41:55.520 --> 41:56.715
Done.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.757
Cut him open?

41:58.840 --> 41:59.920
Won't that, like, hurt him?

42:00.000 --> 42:03.038
Oh, no, male Gifftan pregnancy sacs
don't have any pain sensors

42:03.120 --> 42:04.474
for precisely this reason.

42:04.560 --> 42:07.234
Yeah, but all the same, I mean,
cut open a bloke's stomach,

42:07.320 --> 42:08.800
do we have to?

42:08.880 --> 42:10.416
What, they didn't have that
on <i>Call The Midwife?</i>

42:10.440 --> 42:12.480
I dunno, I always looked away
at the squeamish bits.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.919
As the bomb gets closer,
the energy is building

42:18.000 --> 42:19.036
getting ready to blow.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.680
The Pting must be attracted to that.

42:21.760 --> 42:24.400
Surely! That's what I've been working
on this whole time.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.638
Oh, please don't be wrong,
I'll be so embarrassed.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.120
And dead.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.714
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

42:32.800 --> 42:33.950
Doctor.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.874
I'm not bad, admit it,
I'm not bad, it's all in the timing.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.395
Oh, I do not want this baby.

42:57.480 --> 42:58.834
I can't be a dad.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.673
Hey, none of that now.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.639
Listen to me, Yoss, you can do this.

43:03.960 --> 43:08.113
You're a good man, your baby,
your son will be lucky

43:08.200 --> 43:10.157
to have a good man like you as his dad.

43:10.480 --> 43:13.393
Starting now,
you're going to give him life.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.717
You're going to bring a person
into being, mate,

43:15.800 --> 43:16.950
that is epic.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.315
I'm not ready.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.478
Really? Get a shift on.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.074

43:51.440 --> 43:52.920
Bye-bye, Pting.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.119
Intruder ejected.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.356
First problem gone.

44:05.720 --> 44:07.871
That should keep it fed
for a very long time.

44:18.680 --> 44:21.115
I didn't tell you I was ill.

There's... Plenty of things
I've never told you.
