WEBVTT

00:34.943 --> 00:39.949
Ain't no miracle being born

00:40.031 --> 00:46.960
People doing it every day

00:47.038 --> 00:53.216
Ain't no miracle growing up

00:53.294 --> 00:58.972
People just grow that way

00:59.050 --> 01:01.974
So it goes like it goes

01:02.053 --> 01:04.727
Like the river flows

01:04.806 --> 01:10.484
And time, it rolls right on

01:10.562 --> 01:13.486
And maybe what's good

01:13.565 --> 01:17.490
Gets a little bit better

01:17.569 --> 01:24.498
And maybe what's bad gets gone

01:32.000 --> 01:36.506
Bless the child of a working man

01:36.588 --> 01:42.561
She knows too soon who she is

01:43.845 --> 01:48.521
And bless the hands of a working man

01:48.600 --> 01:54.198
He knows his soul is his

01:54.272 --> 01:57.025
So it goes like it goes

01:57.108 --> 02:00.112
Like the river flows

02:00.194 --> 02:05.291
And time, it rolls right on

02:05.366 --> 02:08.289
And maybe what's good

02:08.369 --> 02:13.466
Gets a little bit better

02:16.294 --> 02:19.889
And maybe what's bad gets gone

02:27.138 --> 02:29.937
Yeah, it goes like it goes

02:30.016 --> 02:32.815
Like the river flows

02:32.894 --> 02:39.197
And time keeps rolling on

02:39.275 --> 02:43.405
And maybe what's good

02:43.488 --> 02:49.416
Gets a little bit better

02:49.494 --> 02:55.342
And maybe what's bad

02:55.416 --> 03:02.391
Gets gone

04:24.589 --> 04:27.809
That's all you're eating
for lunch? An apple?

04:27.884 --> 04:29.431
I'm dieting.

04:30.344 --> 04:32.847
I got to keep my strength up.

04:32.930 --> 04:36.025
I put these preserves up myself.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.855
Sunday, Russell and I put up
over 60 quarts of peaches.

04:41.689 --> 04:44.738
What did you do over
the weekend, Norma?

04:44.817 --> 04:46.740
I soaked my feet.

04:48.613 --> 04:50.911
I saw you in town Sunday.

04:52.116 --> 04:55.120
Your friend drives
a mighty big car.

04:55.203 --> 05:00.130
Well, if you'd looked on the motel
register, you'd seen my name there, too.

05:00.208 --> 05:02.631
It's none of my business.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.760
Mama, you haven't opened
up your sack yet.

05:11.719 --> 05:14.563
Mama, aren't you hungry?

05:14.639 --> 05:16.061
Mama?

05:18.643 --> 05:21.317
Mama, you feeling all right?

05:24.148 --> 05:25.570
Mama?

05:25.650 --> 05:28.073
Mama, can you hear me?

05:28.152 --> 05:29.278
Mama?

05:30.279 --> 05:31.906
Mama!

05:31.989 --> 05:33.957
Mama, come on. Come on now, Mama.
Come on.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.849
She didn't hear one word I said,
and she doesn't hear you right now.

05:49.924 --> 05:52.552
Now, you know that happens, Norma Rae.

05:52.635 --> 05:55.809
Well, it doesn't happen to my mama!

05:55.888 --> 05:57.890
It'll pass off.
It's just temporary.

05:57.974 --> 06:00.134
That makes it OK? She's only
deaf for one or two hours.

06:01.644 --> 06:03.521
She's only deaf all day!

06:03.604 --> 06:05.026
She can get herself another job.

06:05.106 --> 06:08.030
What other job in this town?
This is the only job.

06:09.110 --> 06:10.578
I'll give her a note.

06:10.653 --> 06:12.371
They'll send her home.

06:12.446 --> 06:14.574
Come on, Mama.

06:14.657 --> 06:16.955
They don't care anything about you.

06:33.801 --> 06:35.394
You all right out there?

06:35.469 --> 06:36.812
I'm fine!

06:37.972 --> 06:40.100
You're gonna get all bitten up.

06:40.182 --> 06:43.061
I'll be in! Just a minute!

06:49.817 --> 06:51.410
Well ...

06:53.446 --> 06:56.450
I'm gonna let this pot soak.

06:56.532 --> 06:59.411
There's one soaking from breakfast.

06:59.493 --> 07:01.416
Now it's got company.

07:04.832 --> 07:07.051
Hiya, kids.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.924
10 more minutes of this junk,
then I want you to do your homework.

07:10.004 --> 07:11.472
I did it.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.581
- You did it?
- Yeah.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.809
Unsatisfactory in your lettering,
unsatisfactory in your reading,

07:15.885 --> 07:17.603
and your numbers aren't too good.

07:17.678 --> 07:18.956
You haven't been doing
too much homework.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.813
- Shh! I don't wanna hear.
- Oh, shush! I'll shush you.

07:37.031 --> 07:39.534
What are you getting fixed up for?

07:39.617 --> 07:41.460
I'm going into town.

07:41.535 --> 07:43.663
What do you need in town?

07:43.746 --> 07:45.168
Things.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.545
OK. I'll drive you in.

07:48.292 --> 07:50.169
You got Bonanza on next.

07:50.252 --> 07:54.223
Oh, no. I'm gonna miss that. It's
the same thing every week anyhow.

07:55.716 --> 07:56.968
I'm going to J.C. Penney's,

07:57.051 --> 08:01.807
buy myself some panties and a white
cotton brassiere, size 32-B.

08:01.889 --> 08:04.938
If you wanna come along and sit on the
little stool outside the dressing room

08:05.017 --> 08:07.190
and have all the ladies
look at you, then come on.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.771
No, ma'am. I don't care to do that.

08:10.606 --> 08:12.404
You coming straight back?

08:12.483 --> 08:13.826
No.

08:13.901 --> 08:15.153
After that, I'm going to the drugstore,

08:15.236 --> 08:19.491
buy myself some Kotex pads
and a Cosmopolitan magazine.

08:19.573 --> 08:22.577
Mm-hm. Then you coming home?

08:22.660 --> 08:26.790
Yeah. After that, I'll be so tired
out from all the excitement,

08:26.872 --> 08:28.795
I'll be coming home.

08:36.256 --> 08:37.474
Hi.

08:38.509 --> 08:39.510
Mr. Wichard?

08:41.095 --> 08:42.688
That's right. Vernon Wichard.

08:42.763 --> 08:43.855
Who are you?

08:43.931 --> 08:45.604
My name is Reuben Warshovsky.

08:45.683 --> 08:48.436
Warshovsky. What kind
of name is that?

08:49.353 --> 08:53.529
The kind you have to spell for
telephone operators and headwaiters.

08:53.607 --> 08:55.575
What do you want?

08:55.651 --> 08:58.279
I'd like to get me a
room with a mill family.

08:58.362 --> 09:02.663
What for? We got a hotel, 12
rooms, got a motel, 36 rooms.

09:03.284 --> 09:07.005
I wanna get to know
some mill hands close up.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.706
Why is that?

09:08.789 --> 09:09.869
I'll tell you, Mr. Wichard.

09:09.932 --> 09:13.086
I just got into town
about an hour ago.

09:13.169 --> 09:13.963
Hi. How are you?

09:13.969 --> 09:17.369
I parked my rented car, I got out, and
before I had a chance to adjust my crotch,

09:17.538 --> 09:19.361
the chief of police was on
me saying, "Who are you?

09:19.447 --> 09:21.487
I don't know you. What the
hell are you doing here?"

09:21.635 --> 09:23.933
So I told him I was a
labor organizer.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.399
I've come to put a union in
the O.P. Henley Textile Mill.

09:27.475 --> 09:29.221
And he said, "The hell you are, boy!"
And he gave me a ticket

09:29.230 --> 09:31.197
and told me to get my ass
elsewhere right quick.

09:31.395 --> 09:33.739
He was dead right, too.

09:33.814 --> 09:38.820
As far as I'm concerned, all of you people
are Communists, agitators, crooks, or Jews

09:38.903 --> 09:40.496
or all four rolled together.

09:40.946 --> 09:44.291
Every time you people come into a town,
the folks get throwed out of their jobs,

09:44.366 --> 09:45.788
get their heads busted in ...

09:45.868 --> 09:47.962
Excuse me, sir. Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

09:48.037 --> 09:50.790
How much do you make an hour?

09:50.873 --> 09:53.797
I make $1.33 a frame.

09:53.876 --> 09:56.049
And when did you have your
last cost-of-living raise?

09:56.128 --> 09:57.505
I haven't had that.

09:57.588 --> 10:00.262
With all due respect, Mr.
Wichard, with today's inflation,

10:00.341 --> 10:02.635
that makes you a bit
of a schlemiel.

10:03.844 --> 10:06.438
You calling me some
kind of a name?

10:07.014 --> 10:09.858
You're underpaid.
You're overworked.

10:09.934 --> 10:13.609
They're shafting you right
up to your tonsils.

10:13.687 --> 10:16.110
You need me, sir.

10:16.190 --> 10:18.284
I think maybe if you run real fast,

10:18.359 --> 10:21.829
you're gonna get back to your
car before my dog bites you.

10:21.904 --> 10:24.327
What do you tell him that for?
We ain't even got a dog.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.704
You don't need one.

10:46.303 --> 10:48.021
Hey. How you doing?

10:48.097 --> 10:49.314
Do you have any vacancies?

10:49.390 --> 10:50.113
Yes.

10:50.141 --> 10:51.141
Thank you.

10:52.393 --> 10:53.861
Hi.

10:54.562 --> 10:55.814
Hey.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.484
Very friendly little
town you got here.

10:59.567 --> 11:00.819
So far I've been told

11:00.901 --> 11:04.451
to shove off, get off, and go away.

11:06.949 --> 11:08.917
Oh, it's OK.

11:09.827 --> 11:12.296
Make sure that you spray
your room for roaches.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.669
You got roaches down here?

11:14.748 --> 11:17.001
I'm very familiar with roaches.

11:17.918 --> 11:20.467
Do you have a room with a view?

11:20.546 --> 11:22.344
You got the back alley
or the parking lot.

11:22.423 --> 11:24.016
Which?

11:24.091 --> 11:26.810
Back alley or parking lot?

11:26.886 --> 11:29.765
Give him 31, Alston.

11:29.847 --> 11:31.770
Can't hear the drunks
from in there.

11:46.488 --> 11:50.034
I'll be back this way next
Wednesday after dinner.

11:51.785 --> 11:54.208
I'm having dinner
with my wife's folks.

11:54.288 --> 11:57.258
Tonight was the last time, George.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.176
You don't say, Norma Rae.

11:59.251 --> 12:02.721
Well, now, isn't that
a surprising turn?

12:02.796 --> 12:06.391
No. Been coming on for some time.

12:07.843 --> 12:08.969
You know something funny?

12:09.053 --> 12:10.726
I didn't notice it.

12:10.804 --> 12:13.648
I mean, didn't you get
your steak dinner?

12:13.724 --> 12:15.852
Didn't you get your
box of pralines?

12:16.602 --> 12:20.652
Didn't you come three times in
a row in that bed over there?

12:20.731 --> 12:21.823
I wasn't counting.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.444
Well, well, well.

12:26.695 --> 12:31.041
Looks like I don't know what it takes
to satisfy you these days, does it?

12:31.116 --> 12:34.416
It just doesn't sit well
with me anymore, George.

12:34.495 --> 12:38.466
I mean, you got your wife, got
your two kids in high school.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.384
There's a lot of gossip.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.712
I got my two kids.

12:46.507 --> 12:48.180
I don't know.

12:49.134 --> 12:51.978
It just doesn't make me feel good.

12:53.097 --> 12:55.395
You're here to make me feel good.

12:59.728 --> 13:01.651
I'm not trotting down here anymore.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.732
Why, you hick.

13:04.525 --> 13:07.278
You got dirt under
your fingernails.

13:08.112 --> 13:11.787
You pick your teeth with a matchbook.
I've seen your shit.

13:11.865 --> 13:14.960
What the hell are you
good for, anyway?

13:15.035 --> 13:18.122
You come outta that factory,
you wash under your armpits,

13:18.205 --> 13:20.963
you come on down here and
spread your legs for a poke,

13:21.041 --> 13:23.384
and then you go on home,
and you're dumping me?

13:30.884 --> 13:32.477
I heard a hell of a thump.

13:32.553 --> 13:34.976
That? That was me, getting
throwed across the room.

13:35.055 --> 13:37.524
Come here. I have some ice for that.
Come on.

13:40.561 --> 13:42.529
Sit down. Please.

13:49.737 --> 13:51.705
You look all shook up.

13:53.407 --> 13:55.375
Here, put this on.

13:58.912 --> 14:03.088
I thought everybody down
South was Ashley Wilkes.

14:03.167 --> 14:06.296
You lie down with
dogs, you get fleas.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.882
Well, does this look broken to you?

14:09.965 --> 14:11.842
Go like this.

14:11.925 --> 14:13.677
No, I don't think so.

14:13.761 --> 14:15.229
Do you want an aspirin?

14:15.304 --> 14:16.772
No, thanks.

14:16.847 --> 14:19.771
Band-Aid? Valium?

14:20.309 --> 14:22.061
You're a whole drugstore.

14:22.144 --> 14:23.566
I'm a mild hypochondriac.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.613
Keep that on it.

14:29.610 --> 14:30.782
Ohh.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.748
Me and men.

14:36.241 --> 14:39.536
I ought to learn to say
no right from the start.

14:41.038 --> 14:44.508
But if it wasn't men, I don't
know what it would be.

14:48.629 --> 14:50.097
You got a lot of books.

14:51.382 --> 14:54.010
I'm terrified I’m gonna wake up
in a motel room one morning

14:54.093 --> 14:57.518
and have nothing to read
but the phone book.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.520
She got big eyes.

15:01.725 --> 15:05.187
Yeah, got a big brain, too.

15:07.231 --> 15:09.359
What's her name?

15:10.275 --> 15:12.277
Dorothy Finkelstein.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.324
She's a hotshot labor
lawyer out of Harvard.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.412
Well, she must be your girlfriend if you
haul her picture around wherever you go.

15:21.495 --> 15:24.248
I don't know. We sleep
together on Sunday mornings

15:24.331 --> 15:26.049
and then we read The New York Times.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.220
And I guess that makes
her my girlfriend.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.092
Hey.

15:36.969 --> 15:39.518
- I'm Norma Rae Wilson.
- Reuben Warshovsky.

15:39.847 --> 15:40.894
Nice meeting you.

15:40.973 --> 15:44.227
My pleasure. Keep
that on your nose.

15:44.309 --> 15:48.439
I'm real sorry about my daddy.
He got a short fuse.

15:48.522 --> 15:51.071
Well, my credentials keep me
out of a lot of places.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.369
But I tell you, every
once in a while,

15:53.444 --> 15:57.119
someone opens up their door to me,
puts me in their best bedroom

15:57.197 --> 15:59.450
and treats me just
like I was a cousin.

16:00.492 --> 16:02.745
- Ha ha ha!
- What?

16:02.828 --> 16:05.707
That sure as heck
wouldn't be my daddy!

16:09.209 --> 16:10.836
You a Jew?

16:10.919 --> 16:12.796
I beg your pardon?

16:12.880 --> 16:15.474
Are you a Jew?

16:15.549 --> 16:17.017
Born and bred.

16:20.053 --> 16:21.475
I never met a Jew before.

16:21.555 --> 16:23.523
How you doing?

16:28.562 --> 16:31.111
I heard you all had horns.

16:32.733 --> 16:35.657
Circumcised, yes. Horns, no.

16:37.654 --> 16:42.160
Well, as far as I can see,

16:42.242 --> 16:44.495
you don't look any different
from the rest of us.

16:44.578 --> 16:45.596
Well, we are.

16:45.662 --> 16:46.662
You are?

16:47.664 --> 16:51.009
Well, what makes you different?

16:51.084 --> 16:52.427
History.

16:53.587 --> 16:54.930
Oh.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.308
You got it now?

17:00.219 --> 17:01.311
Hey, it looks better.

17:01.386 --> 17:03.309
I think it stopped.

17:07.476 --> 17:08.853
Thanks a lot for the ice.

17:08.935 --> 17:10.108
Anytime.

17:10.186 --> 17:12.406
Christ, I hope not.

17:13.523 --> 17:14.741
Good morning.

17:16.276 --> 17:18.950
I'm from the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

17:21.448 --> 17:24.041
Read this when you have a
chance, on your break.

17:24.117 --> 17:26.869
Thank you. Good morning.

17:28.622 --> 17:30.374
Read this when you
have a chance, please.

17:30.457 --> 17:31.458
Thank you.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.215
Here you go.

17:34.419 --> 17:36.467
Good morning.

17:36.547 --> 17:38.424
Read this when you get
home and have a chance.

17:38.507 --> 17:41.602
I'm from the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

17:42.928 --> 17:46.774
Read this when you have a chance.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.021
Read this on your break, please.

17:50.561 --> 17:53.064
Wanna read this when you
have a chance, please?

17:53.146 --> 17:55.899
Good morning. I'm from the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

17:55.983 --> 17:59.328
You wanna read this when you
have a chance on your break?

18:02.364 --> 18:03.581
Good morning.

18:05.659 --> 18:07.787
You wanna read this when
you get home, please?

18:07.869 --> 18:11.624
Good morning. I'm with the Textile
Workers' Union of America.

18:11.707 --> 18:14.176
Read this on your break. When
you have a chance, thank you.

18:15.168 --> 18:17.421
Good morning!

18:17.504 --> 18:19.006
How's your nose?

18:19.089 --> 18:21.091
Read that on your break, please.

18:22.009 --> 18:24.683
Hey! There's too many big words.

18:24.761 --> 18:28.190
If I don't understand it, they
ain't gonna understand it.

18:29.099 --> 18:30.817
That fellow a friend
of yours, Norma?

18:30.892 --> 18:32.439
Looks like he's getting to be.

18:32.519 --> 18:36.274
- Better hurry for it, or you'll be late.
- I don't care if I don't get there till tomorrow.

18:37.566 --> 18:38.613
If you have questions,

18:38.692 --> 18:41.491
I'm at the Golden Cherry Motel, room 31.
Read this on your break.

18:42.279 --> 18:45.954
OK, don't be late for work, now, folks.
Good morning to you. Thank you.

18:46.033 --> 18:48.001
Good morning.

18:51.538 --> 18:54.382
All right, lady wants to go to work.

18:54.458 --> 18:56.381
I'll catch you later.

18:59.673 --> 19:00.673
Well ...

19:01.548 --> 19:04.722
One of you guys shows up
about every four years,

19:04.801 --> 19:07.395
about the same time
we get the locusts.

19:08.138 --> 19:09.606
What's your name?

19:09.740 --> 19:10.740
- My name?
- Yeah.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.235
My name's Jimmy Jerome Davis.

19:13.310 --> 19:17.611
Well, Jimmy Jerome, we already got six
of your boss men in civil contempt.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.691
Would you care to make it seven?

19:19.775 --> 19:23.496
Why, hell, we plaster the
toilets with them things.

19:25.989 --> 19:27.787
Wanna read this on your break?

19:29.951 --> 19:31.498
Asshole.

19:44.341 --> 19:48.346
I already told him I wouldn't go out to
dinner with him. What's he want now?

19:48.428 --> 19:52.103
Maybe he wants to make
it breakfast, Norma Rae.

20:07.114 --> 20:09.708
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

20:09.783 --> 20:13.083
Norma, you got the biggest
mouth in this mill.

20:13.161 --> 20:17.041
"Give us a longer break,
give us more smoking time.

20:17.124 --> 20:19.798
Give us a Kotex pad machine."

20:20.460 --> 20:22.258
Do it, and I'll shut up.

20:22.295 --> 20:24.162
Well, we'll do better than that.

20:24.715 --> 20:29.390
We think the only way to close that
mouth is to hand you a promotion.

20:29.469 --> 20:31.938
You're going up in
the world, honey.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.812
Yeah? How far for how much?

20:35.809 --> 20:39.939
Well, we're gonna put
you on spot-checking.

20:42.649 --> 20:45.152
Well, hell, it sure ain't
gonna make me any friends.

20:45.569 --> 20:48.197
It'll make you another
$1.50 an hour.

21:56.056 --> 21:57.558
How am I doing, little girl?

21:58.016 --> 22:00.394
You doing good, Daddy.

22:01.144 --> 22:04.273
I think you better try to
speed it up some, if you can.

22:04.356 --> 22:06.199
I'm going as fast as I can.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.860
Yeah.

22:08.944 --> 22:11.322
Well, they're watching me.

22:11.404 --> 22:13.532
They're watching you.

22:36.763 --> 22:38.686
Well, what, I guess
you're sore at me?

22:38.765 --> 22:42.360
I don't think you should
push your own daddy.

22:42.435 --> 22:44.688
It's more money, Daddy.
I need it for my kids.

22:44.771 --> 22:47.490
Well, I don't need it from my kid.

23:02.122 --> 23:03.965
Millie! Craig!

23:04.040 --> 23:06.964
What are you doing in Grandma's marigolds?
You know she's gonna kill you. Come on.

23:07.043 --> 23:08.523
Craig! Get up from there.
Look at you!

23:08.545 --> 23:09.671
I don't wanna.

23:09.754 --> 23:12.098
Well, you do it anyway!
Look at your behind!

23:12.173 --> 23:14.241
It's filthy-dirty. So full of dirt.

23:14.301 --> 23:16.269
I asked you to watch him.

23:16.344 --> 23:18.438
Criminy! I cleaned you up once!

23:23.010 --> 23:25.934
Come on! Right in here now.

23:26.813 --> 23:29.066
That's it.

23:29.149 --> 23:32.073
Come on, Steve! Come on, Steve!

23:32.152 --> 23:33.620
Come on!

23:44.331 --> 23:47.210
All right! They made it!

23:47.292 --> 23:49.465
He's got an arm on him!

23:49.544 --> 23:50.841
Woo!

23:50.921 --> 23:52.419
Hey, you want something?

23:52.420 --> 23:53.753
Yeah, this is awful.

23:53.965 --> 23:56.684
Get me a hot dog, lots of relish.

23:57.093 --> 23:59.312
- Woo!
- All right!

24:01.097 --> 24:02.770
Hi. Can I have a
hot dog, please?

24:02.849 --> 24:04.601
OK.

24:04.684 --> 24:06.402
Thank you.

24:07.103 --> 24:09.572
Hi, Wilma. Can I have two dogs?

24:09.648 --> 24:11.821
OK. Just a minute.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.868
Hi. How you doing?

24:14.569 --> 24:15.461
You enjoying the game?

24:15.537 --> 24:18.407
Oh, yeah. I love the shortstop. Guy
really goes right into the hole.

24:18.467 --> 24:21.840
I know. That's J.C. McAllister.
Scouts are down here looking at him.

24:24.871 --> 24:28.125
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

24:28.208 --> 24:31.963
This is not Nathan's. I don't
even think this is a hot dog.

24:32.045 --> 24:33.718
What the hell they put in this thing?

24:33.797 --> 24:36.767
Lot of red dye and other things
you don't wanna know about.

24:36.841 --> 24:38.764
Excuse me a minute.

24:47.602 --> 24:49.570
Hello, Norma.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.152
Hey, Ellis.

24:52.232 --> 24:53.984
You're looking fine.

24:54.067 --> 24:56.536
I'm always fine. I'm a horse.

24:58.822 --> 25:00.074
You changed your hair.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.451
It grew.

25:04.411 --> 25:06.038
How's Craig?

25:06.830 --> 25:08.673
He lost a tooth.

25:09.666 --> 25:11.339
You know, it wouldn't
hurt if you came by

25:11.418 --> 25:14.638
to see him every now and then.

25:14.713 --> 25:17.512
I don't believe
I can do that, Norma.

25:17.590 --> 25:22.266
Well, suit yourself.
You always have.

25:31.771 --> 25:33.114
Give me a Coke, will you, please?

25:33.189 --> 25:34.315
You want a Coke?

25:34.399 --> 25:35.400
Yeah.

25:35.483 --> 25:36.951
Two, please.

25:38.028 --> 25:40.406
Thank you. Here, this is for hers.

25:40.488 --> 25:41.614
All right.

25:41.698 --> 25:43.450
Keep the change.

25:43.950 --> 25:45.623
Here you go.

25:48.038 --> 25:50.006
I climbed into the
backseat of his Cadillac

25:50.081 --> 25:52.049
one rainy night six years ago,

25:52.125 --> 25:53.672
stuck my feet out the back window,

25:53.752 --> 25:57.677
and got myself my little Craig
off that Southern gentleman.

25:59.007 --> 26:02.136
He ain't done nothin'
worthwhile since.

26:02.218 --> 26:04.141
Did you get married?

26:04.971 --> 26:07.850
He didn't bother. I didn't bother.

26:09.642 --> 26:11.736
My first affair, as I recollect it,

26:11.811 --> 26:14.906
was with my Hungarian
piano teacher.

26:14.981 --> 26:16.233
I was playing Smetana.

26:16.316 --> 26:18.569
She put her head in my lap.

26:18.651 --> 26:20.949
I tell you, I played
the hell out of that.

26:22.947 --> 26:25.497
Next thing I knew, we
were in her bedroom.

26:25.852 --> 26:29.955
Underneath a Russian icon, and her
husband came home and found us.

26:30.038 --> 26:32.166
The poor guy burst into tears.

26:32.248 --> 26:34.896
I felt so bad, I went up to
him, I put my arms around him,

26:34.914 --> 26:37.614
I said, "Hey, man, I'm
sorry, I'm really sorry,"

26:37.670 --> 26:40.174
and we all went into the kitchen
and had a glass of tea.

26:44.094 --> 26:47.940
I guess it seems like every time you run
into me I'm hassling with some other guy.

26:48.014 --> 26:50.108
That's what it seems like.

26:50.183 --> 26:52.686
What do you think of me, I wonder?

26:54.020 --> 26:57.866
I think you're too smart for
what's happening to you.

27:20.463 --> 27:21.885
Come on, lady, I'm
over here now.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.302
I got the jump on you!

27:30.056 --> 27:33.310
Come on, lady. Come on,
come on, come on, come on!

27:33.393 --> 27:35.737
Mark me down. Mark me down.

27:36.771 --> 27:37.818
I'm over here now, lady!

27:37.897 --> 27:38.944
Come on!

27:39.023 --> 27:40.821
I'm over here.

27:43.444 --> 27:45.162
Hey, lady! Come on!

27:45.238 --> 27:46.410
What you waiting for, girl?

27:46.489 --> 27:48.912
I'm over here now. Come on!

27:51.619 --> 27:53.496
Come on, lady.

27:53.580 --> 27:55.548
I'm over here now.

27:56.666 --> 27:59.340
Come on, lady. Come on.

27:59.419 --> 28:00.511
You damn fool!

28:00.587 --> 28:03.682
You're gonna get us
both to lose our jobs!

28:11.306 --> 28:13.274
I'll get it.

28:19.814 --> 28:21.282
Hey.

28:28.114 --> 28:29.206
I won't trouble you.

28:29.282 --> 28:31.330
I just came to apologize.

28:31.409 --> 28:33.628
I know I could have lost
you your job today.

28:36.456 --> 28:38.800
You sure went crazy on me.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.343
I know.

28:41.461 --> 28:44.180
I got handed divorce
papers this morning.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.974
I guess I went off my head.

28:56.976 --> 28:58.944
Well,

29:01.564 --> 29:02.907
things can get to you.

29:07.904 --> 29:10.578
Would you come and
have a drink with me?

29:10.657 --> 29:14.082
Just to make up for the ruckus
and all the bother I put you to?

29:15.662 --> 29:17.756
I'm Sonny Webster.

29:18.873 --> 29:21.046
You used to come in
my mama's bakery.

29:28.716 --> 29:30.263
- Sonny Webster?
- Yeah.

29:31.177 --> 29:33.600
Sonny Webster! I remember you.

29:33.680 --> 29:38.311
You used to stand behind the cash register
and gave everybody the wrong change.

29:38.393 --> 29:39.940
I never was too good at math.

29:40.019 --> 29:41.646
You're telling me!

29:41.729 --> 29:44.278
Sonny Webster! Golly!

29:46.484 --> 29:48.327
How about that drink?

29:50.321 --> 29:51.914
OK.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.867
Just wait one minute, will you?

29:58.923 --> 30:01.716
Who was that? I heard
a man's voice.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.548
Yep, you did. I'm
going out with him.

30:04.627 --> 30:06.000
Where did you meet him?

30:06.379 --> 30:08.056
Just now, on the front porch.

30:08.125 --> 30:11.777
Some Tom, Dick or Harry comes to the front
door, and you got your hat on? No, sir.

30:12.260 --> 30:14.729
Daddy, I'm over 21. Way over.

30:14.804 --> 30:17.148
Let me say some names to you, Norma.

30:17.223 --> 30:21.944
Buddy Wilson, Ellis Harper, George Benson,
a U.S. sailor, a Trailways bus driver.

30:23.563 --> 30:27.321
None of which is looking after you,
as far as I can see. I got that spot.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.448
It's my roof, my food.

30:29.527 --> 30:32.451
There's something wrong with the
way you try to keep men off me.

30:32.905 --> 30:35.676
There is nothing wrong with a
daddy's love for his little girl.

30:35.689 --> 30:37.489
You oughta be grateful
for your daddy's love.

30:37.552 --> 30:39.805
You're loving me to death.

30:41.305 --> 30:45.856
My needs are very much alive

30:47.420 --> 30:51.220
Is it OK if I stop by

30:53.426 --> 30:56.646
It's all wrong, but it's all right

30:56.763 --> 31:00.108
It's all wrong, but it's all right

31:00.183 --> 31:02.606
Goddarn, that lady can sing.

31:03.603 --> 31:05.571
And her words are so true.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.819
I like Elvis myself.

31:07.899 --> 31:12.200
I wish I could just make a whole lotta
money by opening up my mouth and wailing.

31:12.278 --> 31:13.655
That don't necessarily
make them happy.

31:13.738 --> 31:16.617
What does? What does? What does?
What does?

31:16.699 --> 31:19.794
Oh, I think a man and a woman
is about your best chance.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.890
You are a fine one to top.
Didn't you tell me you got a gun?

31:23.965 --> 31:26.036
You went skinning along on
your belly underneath a bush

31:26.056 --> 31:28.696
and took a beat on your wife and
you was able to blow her head off?

31:28.711 --> 31:31.590
I was gonna burn them both down,

31:31.672 --> 31:35.267
her and her boyfriend,

31:35.343 --> 31:37.311
but I couldn't.

31:39.472 --> 31:43.028
She was a real good person when we
went to school together, you know?

31:43.210 --> 31:47.780
Real nice person, but then a
change had come over her.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.818
It still really amazes me.

31:53.152 --> 31:54.620
Listen.

31:56.614 --> 31:59.538
I'm a lot different
from what I was.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.541
I mean, you go through things.

32:05.081 --> 32:06.173
Hey!

32:06.249 --> 32:07.296
Hey! Whoo!

32:07.375 --> 32:09.469
New York! Hey, man! New York!

32:09.544 --> 32:11.546
Hey, buddy! Hi!

32:12.138 --> 32:13.230
Hey, come on over here!

32:13.506 --> 32:14.883
Hey, we need anybody else?

32:14.966 --> 32:16.092
The more the merrier.

32:16.175 --> 32:18.443
Reuben! Golly!

32:19.637 --> 32:22.316
Here you are with your
papers and everything!

32:22.398 --> 32:23.398
Come on over.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.456
Come on, Reuben. Jeez!

32:25.535 --> 32:27.335
How are you? Reuben, I
want you to meet Sonny.

32:27.687 --> 32:29.564
Sonny, this is Reuben
Warbershowsky.

32:29.647 --> 32:32.150
Close! Sonny, how are you?

32:32.233 --> 32:34.593
- Why don't you sit down there?
- Sit down, take a load off.

32:35.695 --> 32:37.538
What are you doing here?

32:37.613 --> 32:38.705
I'm working.

32:38.781 --> 32:40.408
- You working?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:40.491 --> 32:42.943
- This is a drinking place.
- Drunk or sober, I want 'em.

32:43.327 --> 32:44.920
Can I pour you out one?

32:44.996 --> 32:47.590
No, no, no, thank you. I'll just
have some plain seltzer here.

32:47.665 --> 32:51.010
- You just drinking club soda, then? Is that it?
- That's it, I'm sorry.

32:51.085 --> 32:54.885
Well, you're gonna feel a whole lot
better than I will tomorrow morning.

32:56.048 --> 33:00.474
Reuben is a union man. Thinks he's
gonna put a union in the mill.

33:00.553 --> 33:02.897
But there ain't never been one.

33:02.972 --> 33:05.270
Then maybe its time has come.

33:06.517 --> 33:10.897
Well, there better be more than one of
you, 'cause there's more than one of them.

33:11.731 --> 33:13.233
There will be.

33:14.066 --> 33:17.570
The big companies get everything they want, 
you know? Everything goes to the rich man.

33:17.653 --> 33:19.246
You getting tired of it?

33:19.973 --> 33:24.098
Oh, when I do, I just wash it
down with a beer, you see?

33:28.414 --> 33:30.382
Hey, you know what?

33:31.918 --> 33:35.843
You know, this song on the jukebox?

33:35.922 --> 33:39.426
This was the song I remember it was on
the radio the night they called me up

33:39.509 --> 33:41.029
and they told me my
husband had been killed

33:41.093 --> 33:43.312
in a fight in a beer joint.

33:44.388 --> 33:46.857
Hey, I knew Buddy Wilson, in high school.

33:46.933 --> 33:48.901
- You did?
- Yeah, we had woodshop together.

33:49.038 --> 33:50.332
- You did?
- Yeah.

33:52.013 --> 33:53.813
Yeah. Goll!

33:56.025 --> 33:58.528
He was drunk,
and he got in a fight,

33:58.611 --> 34:01.080
and he broke a beer bottle.

34:01.155 --> 34:05.080
And then this other guy,
he had a broken beer bottle, too.

34:06.118 --> 34:09.496
I remember I went down
to the funeral parlor.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.020
Cause I wanted to
see him, you know?

34:11.090 --> 34:13.272
And this old guy, he
comes out and he says

34:13.275 --> 34:16.675
that he didn't think it'd be
a good idea if I'd see Buddy

34:16.754 --> 34:19.177
'cause he wasn't "prepared" yet.

34:21.967 --> 34:23.060
I don't know, I just ...

34:23.135 --> 34:26.856
I really just wanted to see him

34:26.931 --> 34:29.525
and my daddy wouldn't let me.

34:38.150 --> 34:41.404
Well, that were the end of Buddy.

34:42.572 --> 34:44.540
Far as that goes.

35:01.882 --> 35:02.974
I'm gonna drive.

35:03.050 --> 35:03.876
I'll drive.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.916
What do you mean, you drive?
You're drunk.

35:05.980 --> 35:06.780
So are you.

35:06.387 --> 35:07.513
I think I'll drive.

35:07.597 --> 35:09.770
No, no, no, gang. Here we go.

35:09.849 --> 35:11.351
This way.

35:16.856 --> 35:20.861
I went out with one man and
I'm coming home with two.

35:20.943 --> 35:24.447
Now, that sure as heck is gonna
surprise the hell out of my daddy.

35:24.530 --> 35:26.908
He sure keeps a close
watch on you, doesn't he?

35:26.991 --> 35:29.335
Yeah. We're close.

35:30.369 --> 35:33.714
I remember he used to drive 250 miles

35:33.789 --> 35:36.838
to take me down to Crescent Beach.

35:37.877 --> 35:41.998
He used to buy me a chicken dinner and
take me swimming and tell me jokes.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.193
And we used to sleep in the
back of the car, you know?

35:44.216 --> 35:47.811
We'd wake up that morning, we'd walk out on
the sand and it was all wet and everything.

35:47.887 --> 35:50.515
He bought me this ring
I wear all the time.

35:52.016 --> 35:53.484
Reuben, would you
pull the car over?

35:53.559 --> 35:55.732
I think I'm gonna be sick.

35:59.231 --> 36:00.653
Hang on.

36:01.567 --> 36:03.365
Easy, easy.

36:05.279 --> 36:06.997
You OK?

36:07.073 --> 36:08.370
Come on.

36:09.742 --> 36:13.087
I'd help you, Norma, but I
think I'd give it up, too.

36:24.632 --> 36:27.351
There we are. Now, that
was real ladylike of me.

36:27.426 --> 36:30.771
That’s all right. I did bedpans one
summer at Stuyvesant Hospital.

36:32.598 --> 36:36.068
One of these days,
I will get myself all together.

36:36.143 --> 36:37.360
Well, make it soon.

36:37.436 --> 36:41.278
Because one of these days,
I'm gonna start in on you.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.953
Thank you. Read this when
you have a chance, please.

36:49.615 --> 36:52.209
I took your advice. Got
it down to two syllables.

36:52.284 --> 36:54.036
One's better.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.542
Good morning. Good morning.

36:55.621 --> 36:58.625
Read this when you
have a chance, please.

36:59.625 --> 37:01.844
Good morning, Norma Rae.

37:10.261 --> 37:12.184
Hey, Lucius.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.493
Morning, Lynette.

37:31.157 --> 37:32.579
Linette?

37:45.296 --> 37:47.219
Hey, Billy Joe.

37:54.430 --> 37:57.684
What the hell is going
on around here?

37:59.518 --> 38:01.771
I'm talking to you!

38:03.272 --> 38:04.865
Fink.

38:06.358 --> 38:07.780
Well, shit!

38:20.414 --> 38:22.508
Nobody out there's talking to me.

38:22.583 --> 38:24.802
Less talk, more work.

38:24.877 --> 38:27.175
Yeah, but they're my friends. And
they're gonna stay my friends.

38:27.254 --> 38:29.552
I'm quitting. I'm quitting right
here and I'm quitting right now.

38:29.632 --> 38:31.760
You're speeding them up
so you can weed them out.

38:31.842 --> 38:34.186
You knew all that.

38:36.680 --> 38:40.035
Yeah. Well, I was
greedy, and I was dumb.

38:40.518 --> 38:42.646
And I'm sorry so you can
just go ahead and fire me.

38:43.229 --> 38:48.076
No, we won't do that. We'll put you back
to work in the weaving room, Norma.

38:48.150 --> 38:51.324
Your family's been with
this mill a long time.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.407
Good morning!

39:28.482 --> 39:29.984
Morning!

39:30.734 --> 39:31.735
Hey.

39:31.819 --> 39:32.945
Hey.

39:33.904 --> 39:35.781
We're all ready.

39:35.865 --> 39:36.957
All of you?

39:37.867 --> 39:39.869
All three of us.

39:42.496 --> 39:44.498
Well, then, everybody hop in.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.586
OK. Millie, you can climb in yourself.

39:47.668 --> 39:49.887
OK, now, be careful. Don't fall down.

39:49.962 --> 39:51.259
What's your name, big guy?

39:51.338 --> 39:52.130
Craig.

39:52.199 --> 39:55.959
Right. That there's Craig, and this is Mil-...
Craig, I want you to put your feet on the floor!

39:57.636 --> 39:58.728
Bye!

39:58.804 --> 40:00.397
Bye, Mama.

40:00.472 --> 40:02.065
Bye, Grandma!

40:05.561 --> 40:08.384
- I wanna sit up front.
- Well, you can't.

40:08.522 --> 40:10.069
Are we there yet?

40:10.149 --> 40:13.768
No, we're not there yet, you silly willy.
Goodness sakes.

40:14.403 --> 40:16.076
We just started off.

40:16.155 --> 40:17.748
I thought we were
going to the lake.

40:17.823 --> 40:20.201
We are. I got to make a stop first.

40:20.284 --> 40:23.254
You should have done that
before we got in the car.

40:28.292 --> 40:30.215
This is Alice.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.013
She's mine.

40:36.675 --> 40:39.724
Well, like I always say,
the more the merrier.

40:42.056 --> 40:44.434
OK, you're gonna watch
what you're doing now?

40:53.275 --> 40:56.074
Next time, you get
up there yourself.

40:57.404 --> 41:00.283
You're sure easy with your kids.

41:00.366 --> 41:01.959
I yell at 'em.

41:02.034 --> 41:03.581
I swat 'em.

41:05.955 --> 41:07.878
You're a pretty woman.

41:08.958 --> 41:12.511
I was good at 18, but things
have kinda slipped and slid.

41:12.586 --> 41:15.089
You look all right to me.

41:15.172 --> 41:17.800
Keep the lights down
low, I'm all right.

41:17.883 --> 41:21.103
Well, I'll take you
where it's dark.

41:21.762 --> 41:23.184
I've been there.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.658
I don't owe a nickel in this town.

41:42.741 --> 41:44.459
I'll eat anything that's
put down in front of me.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.788
I can fix anything electrical.

41:47.871 --> 41:49.873
I'm all right after my
first cup of coffee.

41:49.957 --> 41:51.959
I want that bad, though.

41:53.419 --> 41:56.013
I got me a new job
at the gas station.

41:56.088 --> 41:59.809
I turn my paycheck over the minute
I get it, that's every Friday,

41:59.883 --> 42:02.181
and I come straight home from work,

42:02.261 --> 42:05.185
and I stay there.

42:05.264 --> 42:08.268
I got me and Alice, we're alone.

42:09.852 --> 42:11.149
You got your two kids.

42:11.228 --> 42:12.605
You're alone.

42:15.315 --> 42:18.694
If you could help me,

42:18.777 --> 42:20.450
maybe I could help you.

42:23.490 --> 42:26.664
It's been a long
time between offers.

42:33.459 --> 42:35.382
Kiss me.

42:36.045 --> 42:39.219
If that's all right,

42:39.298 --> 42:41.471
then everything else will be.

43:07.659 --> 43:11.247
And now, by the authority vested
in me by this sovereign state,

43:11.330 --> 43:14.129
I pronounce you man and wife.

43:14.208 --> 43:17.178
If you like, you may
kiss the bride.

43:26.678 --> 43:29.894
Mother over here has a
little homemade wine for us.

43:29.973 --> 43:32.476
I picked the berries myself last summer.

43:32.559 --> 43:34.527
Thank you, ma'am.

43:36.133 --> 43:37.133
Thank you.

43:40.943 --> 43:43.116
To my wife, Norma Rae.

43:44.113 --> 43:45.865
And, uh ...

43:47.157 --> 43:49.876
I just hope I can keep up with her.

44:03.132 --> 44:06.636
Roscoe said I shouldn't go,
but I think I'm gonna.

44:06.718 --> 44:09.722
I'm not asking anybody. I'm going.

44:30.242 --> 44:35.999
On October 8, 1970, my grandfather,

44:36.081 --> 44:39.676
Isaac Abraham Warshovsky, age 87,

44:39.751 --> 44:41.753
died in his sleep in New York City.

44:43.130 --> 44:47.681
On the following Friday
morning, his funeral was held.

44:47.759 --> 44:49.978
My mother and father attended,

44:50.053 --> 44:52.977
my two uncles from
Brooklyn attended,

44:53.056 --> 44:55.775
and my Aunt Minnie
came up from Florida.

44:56.935 --> 44:59.688
Also present were 862 members

44:59.771 --> 45:01.523
of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers

45:01.607 --> 45:05.578
and the Cloth, Hat, and Cap
Makers' Union of America.

45:05.652 --> 45:07.871
Also members of his family.

45:09.448 --> 45:13.498
In death, as in life,
they stood at his side.

45:13.577 --> 45:16.956
They had fought battles with him, had
bound the wounds of battle with him,

45:17.039 --> 45:21.545
had earned bread together,
and had broken it together.

45:21.627 --> 45:25.006
When they spoke, they
spoke in one voice,

45:25.088 --> 45:27.887
and they were heard.

45:27.966 --> 45:29.968
And they were black,
and they were white.

45:30.052 --> 45:31.725
And they were Irish,
and they were Polish.

45:31.803 --> 45:34.773
And they were Catholic,
and they were Jews.

45:34.848 --> 45:37.317
And they were one.

45:37.392 --> 45:40.646
That's what a union is, one.

45:43.440 --> 45:47.195
Ladies and gentlemen,
the textile industry,

45:47.277 --> 45:50.872
in which you are spending your
lives and your substance,

45:50.948 --> 45:53.042
and in which your children
and their children

45:53.116 --> 45:55.619
will spend their lives
and their substance,

45:55.702 --> 45:59.757
is the only industry in the whole length and
breadth of these United States of America

45:59.840 --> 46:01.467
that is not unionized.

46:01.750 --> 46:05.755
Therefore, they are free to exploit
you, to lie to you, to cheat you

46:05.837 --> 46:09.091
and to take away from you
what is rightfully yours.

46:09.174 --> 46:13.771
Your health, a decent wage,
a fit place to work.

46:16.223 --> 46:18.066
I would urge you to stop them

46:18.141 --> 46:21.486
by coming over to room 31
at the Golden Cherry Motel

46:21.561 --> 46:24.906
to pick up a union
card and sign it.

46:26.191 --> 46:29.240
Yes, it comes from the Bible.

46:29.319 --> 46:33.415
"According to the
tribes of your fathers,

46:33.490 --> 46:36.414
ye shall inherit."

46:36.493 --> 46:39.588
But it comes from
Reuben Warshovsky,

46:39.663 --> 46:42.462
"Not unless you make it happen."

46:45.627 --> 46:47.049
Thank you.

46:53.385 --> 46:54.853
Thank you, Reverend.

46:54.928 --> 46:56.521
Appreciate it.

46:57.806 --> 47:00.480
Everybody should have come.
They should have heard you.

47:00.559 --> 47:01.560
Next time.

47:01.643 --> 47:04.112
Uh-huh, if I have to drag them.

47:04.187 --> 47:07.210
Hey. You preach real good.

47:07.274 --> 47:08.651
When are you gonna join up?

47:08.734 --> 47:09.786
Me? Who's got the time?

47:09.868 --> 47:12.636
Make the time. Sleep less.
Cause if I don't get some help soon,

47:12.712 --> 47:14.680
I'm outta here and you got nothing.

47:18.785 --> 47:23.541
Hey, I appreciate any help
that you can possibly give me.

47:23.623 --> 47:27.503
Licking stamps, stuffing envelopes,
typing with two fingers, anything.

47:27.586 --> 47:29.338
- I'll show up.
- Thanks.

47:44.811 --> 47:46.358
I'm here.

47:46.438 --> 47:48.782
I'm ready to inspect your plant.

47:50.609 --> 47:52.452
The federal government
of the United States, brothers,

47:52.527 --> 47:55.781
in accordance with federal
court order No. 7778,

47:55.864 --> 47:58.640
states the following. "The
union has the right to inspect

47:58.700 --> 48:01.119
every bulletin board in the
mills at least once a week

48:01.203 --> 48:04.958
to verify in person that its notices
are not being stripped off."

48:08.668 --> 48:09.715
Do you have a trash can?

48:09.795 --> 48:10.967
Inside.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.393
Keep America beautiful.

48:16.468 --> 48:18.266
Downstairs.

48:32.609 --> 48:34.202
Thank you!

48:43.286 --> 48:44.503
Morning!

48:52.629 --> 48:53.721
Morning!

48:53.797 --> 48:56.266
Am I moving too quick
for you or something?

48:56.341 --> 48:58.139
I did my running when
I was in the army.

48:58.218 --> 48:59.970
I'm not in the
army now, brother.

49:00.053 --> 49:02.886
Well, if you're out of shape,
I'll slow down a little bit.

49:02.974 --> 49:03.974
Appreciate it.

49:05.517 --> 49:07.645
Keep it to a basic saunter.

49:14.317 --> 49:15.739
Good morning!

49:15.819 --> 49:19.574
I'm Reuben Warshovsky of the
Textile Workers' Union of America!

49:19.656 --> 49:21.124
What is your name, brother?

49:21.199 --> 49:23.042
- Buffum.
- Mr. Buffum?

49:23.952 --> 49:25.795
How long have you
worked here, sir?

49:25.871 --> 49:27.544
Twelve years.

49:28.248 --> 49:30.967
Do you like your job?

49:31.042 --> 49:32.989
- I'd like to keep it.
- Yes, sir.

49:33.712 --> 49:37.467
Warshovsky! You're
interfering with the work.

49:37.549 --> 49:40.143
Court order says you can't do that.

49:40.218 --> 49:42.141
Well, then, brother,
let us both keep

49:42.220 --> 49:44.939
to the letter of the law.

49:45.015 --> 49:47.518
I ain't got no kike brother.

49:49.060 --> 49:50.983
I don't think you meant
to use that word.

49:51.062 --> 49:52.864
- I meant it.
- You did, huh?

49:52.948 --> 49:55.952
Well, shit, now we're gonna have to
start and get into a fight, huh?

49:56.234 --> 49:57.577
Come on, the bulletin
board's over here.

49:57.652 --> 49:59.780
"Bulletin board's over here!"

50:04.075 --> 50:05.793
Good morning.

50:12.626 --> 50:16.176
Somebody's looking to
get into a car pool.

50:16.254 --> 50:19.383
Somebody wants to
sell a basset pup.

50:19.466 --> 50:22.436
And you can pick pecans
for 40 cents a bushel

50:22.511 --> 50:25.230
at Selma Landing.
Isn't that terrific?

50:25.305 --> 50:27.808
The only thing missing
is my notice.

50:27.891 --> 50:30.019
It's there.

50:30.101 --> 50:32.399
It is? I don't see it.

50:35.774 --> 50:38.027
Ah, yes.

50:39.402 --> 50:42.702
Wilt Chamberlain on stilts
could read that thing, maybe.

50:42.781 --> 50:46.706
Wanna bring it down to eye level,
brothers, where everybody can read it?

50:46.785 --> 50:49.254
We'll make note of your request.

50:50.956 --> 50:53.880
Why do you guys pull
this horseshit, eh?

50:53.959 --> 50:56.838
I'll have to go to the phone, call
my lawyers and get 'em on your ass.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.843
That's childish!

51:00.257 --> 51:02.225
Where's the pay phone and
who's got two nickels?

51:02.300 --> 51:03.722
Hey!

51:05.095 --> 51:06.972
Rick, bring it down.

51:14.312 --> 51:16.064
Eye. Eye level.

51:16.147 --> 51:17.569
Eye.

51:27.742 --> 51:30.441
You ain't supposed to
read the damn thing.

51:30.520 --> 51:34.323
No union organizer, not even a known
union member, has been inside

51:34.377 --> 51:37.977
the fences or walls of this factory for
more than 10 years. I'm reading it.

51:38.461 --> 51:39.461
Well, read fast, then.

51:39.488 --> 51:42.062
All right, tell you what. While I'm
reading this, you go read the court order

51:42.063 --> 51:45.334
that says any agent of this
company can be held in contempt.

51:45.709 --> 51:47.666
You're messing with a
contempt citation, sir.

51:47.728 --> 51:49.661
If you're hot for jail,
you just keep it up.

51:49.848 --> 51:50.895
I ain't violating no laws!

51:50.974 --> 51:52.897
You're violating
the law now, baby!

51:54.352 --> 51:55.854
Can we finish this?

51:55.937 --> 51:57.359
Certainly.

52:01.192 --> 52:03.240
Where's the other bulletin board?

52:03.320 --> 52:04.221
In the weaving room.

52:04.304 --> 52:06.147
- You wanna show it to me?
- Yes. Hell, yes.

52:06.323 --> 52:07.700
Rick!

52:16.374 --> 52:18.968
Good morning. How are you?

52:21.087 --> 52:23.055
Good morning. Morning.

52:23.798 --> 52:25.220
Good morning to you. Good morning.

52:25.300 --> 52:28.682
I'm Warshovsky, Textile
Workers' Union of America.

52:30.096 --> 52:32.975
Good morning. Morning to you.

52:33.058 --> 52:35.311
Good morning, ma'am.

52:36.561 --> 52:37.687
Good morning.

52:37.771 --> 52:40.399
Warshovsky, Textile
Workers' Union of America.

52:40.482 --> 52:43.452
Good morning. Good
morning to you, ma'am.

52:48.740 --> 52:50.242
Good morning.

52:50.325 --> 52:53.044
I'm in room 31 of the
Golden Cherry Motel

52:53.119 --> 52:55.588
if you have any questions.
Thank you!

52:57.207 --> 52:59.130
Good morning.

53:01.086 --> 53:03.009
Good morning to you.

53:04.381 --> 53:06.304
Good morning.

53:11.096 --> 53:12.848
Nice.

53:15.934 --> 53:21.361
Gentlemen, your average
working man is not stupid.

53:21.439 --> 53:23.862
He just gets tired.

53:23.942 --> 53:27.697
You wanna move this
out of here, please?

53:43.211 --> 53:45.714
Move it. Move the stuff.

54:18.163 --> 54:19.881
Hey, Reuben?

54:19.956 --> 54:21.549
Hey.

54:21.624 --> 54:22.491
- You busy?
- Oh yeah.

54:22.567 --> 54:24.140
Very busy.

54:25.628 --> 54:26.429
Well, can I come in?

54:26.513 --> 54:27.856
Please.

54:38.975 --> 54:42.696
Jeez, don't they ever
clean up around here?

54:44.689 --> 54:46.316
I don't want them
messing with my stuff.

54:46.399 --> 54:48.697
I know where everything is.

54:50.403 --> 54:52.868
If I joined up with you,
would I lose my job?

54:52.947 --> 54:54.369
No way.

54:55.033 --> 54:58.457
You can wear a union button as big
as a Frisbee when you go to work,

54:58.536 --> 55:03.042
you can talk union to any mill hands who
wanna listen as long as it's during a break,

55:03.124 --> 55:05.873
you can take union pamphlets to
the mill and pass them along.

55:05.952 --> 55:08.050
There's not a goddamn thing
they can do to touch you.

55:10.799 --> 55:14.144
I was never a very good Girl Scout.

55:14.219 --> 55:16.642
I'll go along with you.

55:16.721 --> 55:18.769
You're the fish I wanted to hook.

55:20.225 --> 55:21.727
Well ...

55:23.728 --> 55:26.356
You got me.

55:26.439 --> 55:28.316
So what the hell you
gonna do with me?

55:28.399 --> 55:30.072
Make a mensch out of you, kid.

55:30.107 --> 55:31.607
- You are?
- Mh-hm.

55:32.445 --> 55:33.788
What is that?

55:35.990 --> 55:38.664
Somebody who goes to the old
folks' home on Saturday morning

55:38.743 --> 55:41.496
to visit instead of playing golf.

55:41.579 --> 55:45.004
Somebody who puts a dollar in a
blind man's cup for a pencil.

55:45.083 --> 55:46.655
- I'd do that.
- Uh-huh.

55:46.918 --> 55:49.091
But would you take the pencil?

55:49.170 --> 55:50.638
Course I would. I paid for it.

55:50.713 --> 55:54.308
Hey, somewhere between logic and charity
maybe there falls a little shadow?

55:54.384 --> 55:55.251
Reuben, if you put ...

55:55.326 --> 55:57.579
We could debate this all night.
Here.

55:59.013 --> 56:00.435
Sign this.

56:14.195 --> 56:16.414
"Norma Rae Webster."

56:16.906 --> 56:19.125
How come everybody down
here has three names?

56:22.161 --> 56:26.507
Come on, Wayne, let me pin
this old thing on you.

56:26.583 --> 56:30.053
It would cover up the
gravy spot on your shirt.

56:30.128 --> 56:33.177
Now, what do I get if I do?

56:33.256 --> 56:36.055
You don't get nothing if you don't.

56:36.134 --> 56:38.512
Besides, ain't you
had enough of that?

56:38.595 --> 56:41.800
You and me, we used to heat up that
NCO club down at the base pretty good.

56:41.894 --> 56:42.894
Remember?

56:42.982 --> 56:44.250
Bygone days.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.360
Well ...

56:45.685 --> 56:47.608
Then pin it on for bygone days.

56:47.687 --> 56:50.156
Oh, good, Wayne, I'm
so proud of you.

56:51.733 --> 56:55.078
You think we'll ever see that
club again, Norma, honey?

56:55.153 --> 56:58.202
Take your wife. She
doesn't get out much.

57:00.992 --> 57:04.667
Looks like you've strayed
off the reservation, Norma.

57:04.746 --> 57:06.498
Is that right?

57:08.666 --> 57:12.136
You got your own coffee
machine at your end.

57:12.211 --> 57:14.134
Yeah, but I don't got
a water fountain.

57:14.213 --> 57:17.387
And I gotta cool down my
coffee before I drink it.

57:17.467 --> 57:19.390
You'll cool everything!

57:35.276 --> 57:37.449
- Hey, Reverend.
- Well ...

57:37.528 --> 57:40.605
- Norma. You caught me in my shirtsleeves.
- Oh, that's OK.

57:41.366 --> 57:44.119
Maybe we can have us some flowers
out of your yard for Sunday?

57:44.202 --> 57:46.330
Spider mites eaten up everything.

57:46.412 --> 57:47.880
OK.

57:49.332 --> 57:51.960
Somehow I can help you, Norma?

57:53.878 --> 57:56.802
How long I been coming
to this church, Reverend?

57:56.881 --> 57:58.883
Since you were a little girl.

57:58.967 --> 58:00.389
That's right.

58:00.468 --> 58:03.267
I accepted Christ when
I was 6 years old, didn't I?

58:07.558 --> 58:11.483
Well, would you call
me a good Christian?

58:11.562 --> 58:13.314
With a lapse or two, I'd say so.

58:13.398 --> 58:15.821
With a lapse or two.

58:15.900 --> 58:18.369
Would you call yourself
a good Christian?

58:18.444 --> 58:20.196
That's for the Lord to say.

58:22.407 --> 58:25.086
I want this church for a union
meeting next Saturday afternoon.

58:25.168 --> 58:28.172
That's blacks and whites
sitting together.

58:28.454 --> 58:30.047
This is a house of God.

58:30.123 --> 58:32.876
That's what I'm waiting to see
whether it is or whether it isn't.

58:32.959 --> 58:35.303
You're coming mighty close
to blasphemy, Norma.

58:35.628 --> 58:38.509
I've come here and said I sinned
and I done wrong and I'm sorry

58:38.516 --> 58:40.349
and I asked for God
to forgive me.

58:40.591 --> 58:42.844
Now, I wanna see what
this church stands for,

58:42.927 --> 58:45.007
I wanna see if you'll stand
up in that pulpit and say

58:45.014 --> 58:46.934
there oughta be justice,
there oughta be a union,

58:47.181 --> 58:50.152
and if you're smitten and you rise
up, then the Lord'll be on your side.

58:50.202 --> 58:51.469
And if you don't,

58:51.728 --> 58:54.527
then I say, there ain't nothin'
good for me in that church.

58:54.605 --> 58:56.207
And I'm gonna leave it flat.

59:03.031 --> 59:05.875
We're gonna miss your
voice in the choir, Norma.

59:10.913 --> 59:14.008
You're gonna hear it
raised up someplace else.

59:26.971 --> 59:30.396
Y'all go in and sit down,
I'll be in there in a minute.

59:41.319 --> 59:45.040
We're holding a meeting at our
house, Jimmy Jerome. Union business.

59:45.114 --> 59:48.414
Afterward we're having
lemonade and cookies. Ginger snaps?

59:48.493 --> 59:50.996
I'll roll up the front shades,
so you can see right in.

59:51.079 --> 59:52.581
Washed my windows on Saturday.

59:52.663 --> 59:55.507
You shouldn't have any trouble.

01:00:01.672 --> 01:00:04.425
You're going too far now, Norma.
This here is our home.

01:00:04.509 --> 01:00:06.011
How am I going too far?

01:00:06.844 --> 01:00:08.767
There's a bunch of
black men in there.

01:00:08.846 --> 01:00:10.223
You're gonna get us in a
whole lot of trouble.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.382
I ain't never had any trouble with
black men.

01:00:12.469 --> 01:00:15.074
Only trouble I ever had in
my life was with white men.

01:00:23.256 --> 01:00:26.305
I remember some of
you from the Chockoyotte church.

01:00:27.092 --> 01:00:29.359
I did all of the talking that day.

01:00:30.381 --> 01:00:33.808
Now I would like for you to speak.

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:35.970
Please.

01:00:52.807 --> 01:00:58.405
A man's work should be a man's
work, not a term in jail.

01:00:58.991 --> 01:01:02.564
The Blacks have been pushed,
pulled, and scorned. For what?

01:01:03.524 --> 01:01:07.649
If the union is what everybody
believes in, I'm for it all the way.

01:01:10.127 --> 01:01:13.472
Excuse me for saying
this with menfolks in the room,

01:01:13.547 --> 01:01:18.070
but when I get my menstrual
cramps, which come pretty hard,

01:01:18.749 --> 01:01:21.753
they don't let me
sit down on my job.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:27.009
They say you gotta keep to your feet

01:01:27.091 --> 01:01:30.015
unless you bring a note from the doctor.

01:01:30.094 --> 01:01:32.517
We wouldn't say we was sick if we wasn't.

01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:37.397
You know, I look at a brick wall all day.

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:39.570
There used to be a window there.

01:01:39.645 --> 01:01:42.615
They come and brick it up to give
us the feeling that we're shut in.

01:01:45.443 --> 01:01:49.198
My husband, Averill, died of brown
lung two months ago.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:55.246
His children are gonna grow up not even

01:01:55.328 --> 01:01:56.625
knowing him.

01:02:03.461 --> 01:02:07.341
I got all his clothes, if
someone could use them.

01:02:19.894 --> 01:02:22.647
I'm not getting the message across.

01:02:24.148 --> 01:02:26.321
17 people out of 800?

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:32.165
Well, you're an outsider.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.334
Things move slow around here.

01:02:34.408 --> 01:02:37.252
This isn't New York, where you
grab a taxi and grab your hat.

01:02:37.328 --> 01:02:39.296
- Mama, Craig's wetting the bed.
- Oh, shikes.

01:02:41.332 --> 01:02:45.302
I told him not to drink Coke
before he gets to sleep.

01:02:47.088 --> 01:02:48.806
Craig?

01:02:48.881 --> 01:02:50.929
Come on, sugar, wake up.

01:02:51.008 --> 01:02:52.225
Get up.

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:54.895
Put your arms around my neck.
Atta boy.

01:03:06.774 --> 01:03:09.118
You got any ideas?

01:03:09.193 --> 01:03:12.716
Yeah. Get a jug of corn whiskey
and meet me here on Saturday.

01:03:12.796 --> 01:03:14.420
We're gonna hit the back roads.

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:18.168
Are you finished, honey?

01:03:18.244 --> 01:03:19.712
OK.

01:03:20.413 --> 01:03:22.882
No more Cokes before
you go to sleep.

01:03:33.884 --> 01:03:38.355
Hey you, Mr. Robinson.
How you doing today?

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:40.483
I'm busy.

01:03:40.558 --> 01:03:42.902
I'm Norma Rae. You know me.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.647
Yeah. How do you do?

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.528
Good to see you. This
is my friend Reuben.

01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:49.825
- Hi, how you doing? Nice to see you.
- How do you do?

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.200
Listen, sir. Why don't you
read this, if you will, sir,

01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:54.826
and I'll fix your tire for you.

01:03:54.905 --> 01:03:56.282
How about that?

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:58.288
- You got a deal.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:02.997 --> 01:04:04.294
You know how do this?

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.091
Are you kidding? I
don't even got a car.

01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:08.511
Let's look like we
know what we're doing.

01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:14.591
- Reuben?
- What?

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.150
I think he was
taking this thing off.

01:04:27.902 --> 01:04:30.307
You gonna make us a baseball
bat or something?

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:37.333
Hey! Hi, Joe. How are you? How about
you read one of these, will you?

01:04:37.408 --> 01:04:39.081
Hey. Hey, Jake, how you doing?

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.940
Will you read one of those for me, please?

01:04:41.019 --> 01:04:41.586
José, everybody!

01:04:41.822 --> 01:04:45.090
Hi, James, how are you? I want you to
meet Reuben here. He's a friend of mine.

01:04:45.183 --> 01:04:46.609
How you doing, gentlemen?

01:04:47.488 --> 01:04:49.614
- Would you like to read one of these, sir?
- No.

01:04:49.997 --> 01:04:51.999
Elwood? Bob? You wanna
read one of these?

01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.130
I wouldn't be interested.

01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:55.183
Bob? You're not
interested in a union?

01:04:55.262 --> 01:04:55.880
No, no.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.387
Why? You think you're going to get
a better shake from management

01:04:58.466 --> 01:04:59.744
than you are from the union?

01:04:59.783 --> 01:05:02.183
- I always have.
- You always have, huh?

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:03.740
Ow!

01:05:03.741 --> 01:05:05.129
Damn glad you cut it.

01:05:08.813 --> 01:05:10.156
That's telled him.

01:05:10.481 --> 01:05:12.074
Hey, Robert.

01:05:12.149 --> 01:05:13.446
- Hi, Norma.
- Hi.

01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:14.985
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:05:15.319 --> 01:05:16.696
- We come out ...
- Ah!

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:22.706
It's only grass and water, Reuben.

01:05:35.172 --> 01:05:38.267
This is where we used to
swim when we were kids.

01:05:38.342 --> 01:05:41.767
We'd come down here after we'd took it off
from school and chuck off our clothes

01:05:41.846 --> 01:05:43.268
and jump in.

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:47.777
The only water hole I
ever saw when I was a kid

01:05:47.852 --> 01:05:51.482
was when we used to open the
fire hydrant on 110th and Riverside

01:05:51.564 --> 01:05:53.237
with a monkey wrench.

01:05:55.067 --> 01:05:56.694
This is the life!

01:05:56.777 --> 01:05:59.530
- It's just an old mud hole.
- Oh, it's terrific.

01:05:59.613 --> 01:06:01.741
It's cooling off my mosquito bites.

01:06:03.534 --> 01:06:06.083
This is as clean as I'm gonna get this.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.835
Thank you.

01:06:11.459 --> 01:06:12.676
Whoo!

01:06:13.377 --> 01:06:15.004
It is hot.

01:06:16.714 --> 01:06:17.966
I'm coming in.

01:06:18.048 --> 01:06:19.516
Come on.

01:06:36.066 --> 01:06:37.488
You know what?

01:06:37.568 --> 01:06:42.494
There used to be this old farmer,
lived around here ... with a BB gun.

01:06:45.576 --> 01:06:47.499
Sure hope he's moved away.

01:06:47.578 --> 01:06:49.501
Yeah. Me, too.

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:53.084
What's that? Something's
flicking around my ...

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.211
Those are minnows.

01:06:55.294 --> 01:06:56.295
Those are what?

01:06:56.378 --> 01:06:57.846
Minnows. They won't hurt you.

01:06:57.922 --> 01:06:59.139
They better not.

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:02.640
You're a fish out
of water down here.

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:05.597
This is not exactly my native habitat.

01:07:06.931 --> 01:07:12.153
Reuben? What would you be doing on a
day like this at home?

01:07:15.147 --> 01:07:18.492
Play some handball at the Y,
go see Aida at the Met.

01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:23.080
Eat Chinese, play a little
poker, hit the sack.

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:31.043
I've been two places in my life.

01:07:31.121 --> 01:07:35.130
I've been to Henleyville,
been on down to Piston.

01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:38.637
Oh, you'd love New York.

01:07:38.712 --> 01:07:40.339
You would, wow.

01:07:40.422 --> 01:07:42.049
Super town.

01:07:42.132 --> 01:07:43.930
Most beautiful women
in the world,

01:07:44.009 --> 01:07:48.936
best food, opera, theater, ballet.

01:07:50.224 --> 01:07:51.396
Reuben?

01:07:51.475 --> 01:07:53.022
What?

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.319
You're homesick.

01:07:54.395 --> 01:07:55.772
Oy vey.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.695
God.

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:00.117
Reuben?

01:08:01.986 --> 01:08:04.080
You got a skinny build.

01:08:04.154 --> 01:08:05.246
Yeah?

01:08:08.576 --> 01:08:10.999
Sonny works out with weights.

01:08:12.997 --> 01:08:14.465
I tried that.

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:18.009
I dropped them and
broke my goddamn foot.

01:08:20.004 --> 01:08:21.130
Well ...

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.935
You don't gotta worry, 'cause
you got a head on you

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.353
and you use it.

01:08:45.194 --> 01:08:46.367
What?

01:08:48.032 --> 01:08:51.337
Why, I know why we got a bad
connection here, Henry.

01:08:51.412 --> 01:08:53.341
It's 'cause I think the
line is being tapped.

01:08:53.424 --> 01:08:55.846
Hey, you? Who's ever
listening in on this,

01:08:55.926 --> 01:08:58.875
this is Norma Rae Webster and I'm
talking union to Henry Willis.

01:08:59.054 --> 01:09:03.281
I'm on tonight and every night.
Same old story, no commercials.

01:09:03.464 --> 01:09:05.432
Union, union, unions.

01:09:05.506 --> 01:09:08.727
Look, why don't you have
your boss man tap me?

01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:12.305
And then you can go on home
to your wife and kids.

01:09:12.389 --> 01:09:14.858
Henry, let ... Henry?

01:09:15.893 --> 01:09:17.145
Oh, shoot!

01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:21.819
You ain't getting any sleep.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:24.520
I ain't getting any sleep, and I
gotta get to work in the morning.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.868
I got a hundred calls to make tonight.

01:09:30.448 --> 01:09:32.667
Is that going on our phone bill?

01:09:32.743 --> 01:09:35.371
We'll take it out of my
paycheck, all right?

01:09:35.453 --> 01:09:37.081
This damn milk is sour!

01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:41.377
I didn't have a chance
to get to the market.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.881
Oh, you didn't have a chance
to get to the market, did you?

01:09:43.955 --> 01:09:45.399
And you didn't get to the washing,

01:09:45.475 --> 01:09:47.872
and you didn't get to the kids,
and you didn't get to me!

01:09:48.361 --> 01:09:49.361
Is that right?

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:51.178
That's right! That's right!

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.634
Damn TV dinners, kids going
around in dirty jeans!

01:09:55.933 --> 01:09:58.481
I'm going around, uh, without!

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.187
Altogether!

01:10:14.368 --> 01:10:16.291
You want cooking?

01:10:26.588 --> 01:10:28.306
You got cooking.

01:10:30.509 --> 01:10:32.227
You want laundry?

01:10:36.056 --> 01:10:37.649
You got laundry.

01:10:40.144 --> 01:10:42.067
You want ironing?

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:46.237
You got ironing.

01:10:46.316 --> 01:10:47.659
You wanna make love?

01:10:47.735 --> 01:10:51.615
You get behind me and lift up my
nighty, and we're gonna make love.

01:10:53.657 --> 01:10:54.829
Norma.

01:10:57.161 --> 01:10:59.334
Norma!

01:10:59.413 --> 01:11:00.585
Hey.

01:11:14.787 --> 01:11:16.967
Rita? Y'all come on down to
the Golden Cherry this time.

01:11:16.969 --> 01:11:19.136
Don't just read it and
nod your head at me.

01:11:19.349 --> 01:11:23.145
Hey, Doris. Millicent. Come on down,
too, and bring your peanut butter pie.

01:11:23.762 --> 01:11:26.995
Hey, Vicky. Deborah? How's your little one?
Heard he got the measles.

01:11:27.008 --> 01:11:28.975
Keep him away from mine, will you?

01:11:29.526 --> 01:11:32.405
Hey, Brenda, how's
your new baby?

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:35.833
Listen, get on down to the Golden Cherry.
You could type, I know you can type.

01:11:35.984 --> 01:11:38.584
Hey, get on down to the Golden
Cherry, will you, and help us out?

01:11:39.885 --> 01:11:43.885
Sue, now, come on, read this. Every
single word of it's important.

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:47.357
And come on down to the Golden Cherry.
Cause if I got the time, you got the time.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.354
Well, I don't bump into
you much anymore, do I?

01:12:03.602 --> 01:12:05.354
You all right, Daddy?

01:12:05.437 --> 01:12:06.939
About the same.

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:10.909
Your color's bad.
You been drinking?

01:12:10.984 --> 01:12:12.361
Thimbleful now and then.

01:12:12.444 --> 01:12:14.867
Well, you know it's
not good for you.

01:12:14.947 --> 01:12:16.369
Oh, honey, what's the difference?

01:12:16.448 --> 01:12:19.702
Sometimes I wonder when I lie
down if I'm gonna get up again.

01:12:21.453 --> 01:12:23.672
Don't talk old to me.
I don't like it.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:27.547
Listen.

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:34.391
I'm gonna come over there
one of these nights real soon

01:12:34.466 --> 01:12:36.935
and take you out to a grand supper.
How about that?

01:12:38.345 --> 01:12:39.642
- OK.
- OK.

01:12:39.721 --> 01:12:41.143
OK.

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:12.588
James, uh ... coming back?

01:13:12.671 --> 01:13:14.514
I guess so.

01:13:15.841 --> 01:13:17.764
Where'd he go, home?

01:13:17.843 --> 01:13:19.311
I don't know.

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:22.431
Jesus.

01:13:22.514 --> 01:13:24.983
I oughta be going home, too.

01:13:30.063 --> 01:13:32.737
Hey, how's Dorothy?

01:13:33.817 --> 01:13:36.070
Terrific. Thanks.

01:13:36.153 --> 01:13:38.155
I see you got a new picture of her.

01:13:39.119 --> 01:13:40.119
Oh, yeah?

01:13:40.324 --> 01:13:42.894
You like it, huh? My
mother sent that.

01:13:43.869 --> 01:13:47.624
She and your mother, they
must get along real well.

01:13:48.749 --> 01:13:51.628
Are you kidding?
My mother loves her.

01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:55.681
She's a lawyer, she's lefto, she's
Jewish, and she's a great cook.

01:13:55.756 --> 01:13:57.474
What the hell else
could she want?

01:14:03.055 --> 01:14:05.308
How come she's so smart?

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:06.642
Dorothy?

01:14:07.851 --> 01:14:08.943
Books.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:13.574
Oh. Oh, madame, your dinner.

01:14:14.358 --> 01:14:17.285
Le grand banana and a beer.

01:14:17.361 --> 01:14:18.487
No.

01:14:21.823 --> 01:14:23.450
Who's this?

01:14:23.533 --> 01:14:25.001
Dylan Thomas?

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:31.171
He was a poet, a
genius and a drunk.

01:14:35.087 --> 01:14:37.681
What's he write about?

01:14:37.756 --> 01:14:42.727
Love, sex, death, other
matters of consequence.

01:14:43.929 --> 01:14:45.647
Is he hard to read?

01:14:45.722 --> 01:14:46.939
Eh ...

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.015
Eh ...

01:14:48.934 --> 01:14:50.936
So why should I bother?

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:54.819
Cause maybe he has
something to say to you.

01:14:54.898 --> 01:14:56.821
Open that, will you?

01:14:59.903 --> 01:15:03.658
"Rage, rage against the
dying of the light."

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:04.832
Yeah?

01:15:04.908 --> 01:15:06.000
Yeah.

01:15:07.494 --> 01:15:10.585
Well, I'll try him.

01:15:10.664 --> 01:15:11.756
Good.

01:15:13.917 --> 01:15:18.514
Hell, there ain't nothing
on TV but reruns anyway.

01:15:18.588 --> 01:15:20.431
Hey, you wanna do me a favor?
Don't eat while you read.

01:15:20.507 --> 01:15:22.805
I can't stand banana in my books.

01:15:22.884 --> 01:15:25.057
Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch.

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.893
Hey, Warren?

01:16:07.304 --> 01:16:08.726
Warren?

01:16:11.683 --> 01:16:14.402
Hey, man, what's happening?
Nobody showed up at the meeting.

01:16:14.478 --> 01:16:17.607
- They got us on a stretch-out.
- Oh, man.

01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:20.192
Put us on a three-day week.

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:23.324
Twice as much work for half the pay.

01:16:23.403 --> 01:16:24.856
All on account of you.

01:16:24.894 --> 01:16:26.194
Hey, just a second, huh?

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:29.084
Now, you just stand
there for a minute.

01:16:35.332 --> 01:16:36.754
Oh, man.

01:16:41.588 --> 01:16:45.559
Now, there's six turnips and
two quarts of water in there.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.808
That's supper for seven people.

01:16:48.887 --> 01:16:50.981
You just go sell your
union someplace else.

01:16:51.056 --> 01:16:52.399
Hey, I'm trying to get you ...

01:16:57.097 --> 01:16:58.097
Dammit.

01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:21.466
My arm's gone numb on me, Jimmy.
I think I better go and lie down.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.265
Y'all got a break coming
up in 15 minutes, Vernon.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.138
I think I better go now, Jimmy.

01:17:27.217 --> 01:17:29.640
Y'all hang on, Vern.
Your break's coming up.

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:38.835
Grab hold of your bucket, Lucius.
In a minute.

01:18:39.539 --> 01:18:42.167
Mavis, Rhonda.

01:18:47.047 --> 01:18:48.765
Hey, Betty.

01:18:50.842 --> 01:18:53.846
You get off your shift at 3. You
were supposed to be here at 3:15.

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:57.559
It's 4:15. Where the hell you been? You
working for this union or aren't you?

01:18:57.641 --> 01:18:59.264
I was getting my tooth filled.

01:19:00.143 --> 01:19:02.566
You were getting your
beer gut filled!

01:19:03.813 --> 01:19:06.657
Chew your old man out at
home and get off me, Norma.

01:19:06.733 --> 01:19:11.990
I'm just starting in on you. Now, I'm
giving 9, 10, 11, 12 hours here every day.

01:19:12.072 --> 01:19:14.575
There's a pile of work around here.
We're doing our share.

01:19:14.658 --> 01:19:17.152
But either do your share or don't
call yourself a union member!

01:19:17.226 --> 01:19:22.403
Norma! Shut your cake hole. In fact,
get the hell out of the office.

01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:25.627
What'd I do? I only
said what was true.

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:27.257
Out.

01:19:27.337 --> 01:19:28.805
Come on.

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:35.016
Peter.

01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:37.723
Get to work. Come on.

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.400
Let's go. Everybody back to work.
Come on.

01:19:57.117 --> 01:19:58.710
Mouth.

01:20:00.065 --> 01:20:01.398
You're too muscular.

01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:03.422
You can't come down
that hard on a man

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:05.921
and leave him his balls.
Easy. Jesus.

01:20:07.294 --> 01:20:10.673
If you were in the state
department, we'd be at war.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:15.184
- All right. I got a big mouth.
- Mh-hm.

01:20:19.806 --> 01:20:23.151
You know, cotton mill workers
are known as trash to some.

01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:29.529
I know, the union's the only
way we'll get our own voice

01:20:29.607 --> 01:20:32.076
and make ourselves any better.

01:20:33.194 --> 01:20:35.572
I guess that's why I push.

01:20:35.655 --> 01:20:37.749
Our own Mother Jones.

01:20:37.824 --> 01:20:39.826
Who's she?

01:20:39.909 --> 01:20:42.128
She was some considerable lady.

01:20:42.203 --> 01:20:44.674
She made it happen for the
coal miners in West Virginia.

01:20:46.249 --> 01:20:49.173
You ain't mad at me?

01:20:50.587 --> 01:20:52.681
If the situation ever called

01:20:52.756 --> 01:20:58.513
for a smart, loud, profane,
sloppy, hard-working woman,

01:20:58.595 --> 01:21:01.189
I'd pick you every time, kid.

01:21:01.264 --> 01:21:04.359
Well, how come sloppy? Nobody
wears girdles anymore.

01:21:06.269 --> 01:21:08.442
What are you giving this to me for?
I didn't order anything.

01:21:08.521 --> 01:21:10.444
Well, hey, you ate it!

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:32.671
What do you want?

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:34.176
Warshovsky around?

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:38.347
Reuben's at the printer's.

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.520
Pretty late for the printer's.

01:21:42.347 --> 01:21:44.896
Yeah, well. Reuben keeps
'em working late.

01:21:45.767 --> 01:21:48.236
You're Norma Rae, aren't you?

01:21:48.478 --> 01:21:49.479
Huh?

01:21:50.271 --> 01:21:52.820
I'm Mrs. Webster.

01:21:52.899 --> 01:21:55.072
We're from the union
national headquarters.

01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:56.903
This is Al London, I'm Sam Dankin.

01:21:56.986 --> 01:21:59.159
Is that right?

01:21:59.239 --> 01:22:03.085
Well, now that you're here I might
as well give you my shopping list.

01:22:03.159 --> 01:22:06.504
Let me see. We need some more
envelopes, we need some stamps.

01:22:06.579 --> 01:22:08.001
We're almost out of typing paper.

01:22:08.081 --> 01:22:12.006
Hey, we could do with a loudspeaker. And how
about some typewriters that don't stick?

01:22:13.002 --> 01:22:15.425
We're not in office
supplies, Mrs. Webster.

01:22:15.505 --> 01:22:18.600
And you aren't around
here much, either.

01:22:18.675 --> 01:22:20.268
Ah. Hello, Reuben.

01:22:20.343 --> 01:22:22.797
- Sam, how are you?
- All right.

01:22:22.851 --> 01:22:23.618
You're getting fat.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.182
Yeah, I gained a couple pounds.

01:22:25.265 --> 01:22:26.687
Al, how are you?

01:22:26.766 --> 01:22:29.189
Lousy. I got a cold.

01:22:30.353 --> 01:22:32.276
What brings you guys?

01:22:33.022 --> 01:22:35.445
You're not getting up much
of a head of steam, Reuben.

01:22:35.525 --> 01:22:38.870
You've had my reports. You
know what I'm up against.

01:22:38.945 --> 01:22:40.367
We're worried.

01:22:40.447 --> 01:22:41.994
That makes three of us.

01:22:42.073 --> 01:22:44.997
It's a small, Southern
Baptist town, Reuben.

01:22:45.076 --> 01:22:46.953
You got to keep your
nose very clean.

01:22:47.036 --> 01:22:49.960
Why? You see any snot in mine?

01:22:52.584 --> 01:22:54.962
Maybe Mrs. Webster
would like to leave?

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.052
Why should she leave?

01:22:58.131 --> 01:22:59.303
Cause this concerns her

01:22:59.382 --> 01:23:00.859
and I'm trying to make
it easy on her ...

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:04.036
Oh, come on. Will you, please?
It's late. What do you guys want?

01:23:06.723 --> 01:23:09.067
If the company wants
us to look bad,

01:23:09.142 --> 01:23:12.692
they'll use anything they
can to make us look bad.

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:16.491
Reuben, the mill hands in this
town go to church every Sunday.

01:23:16.566 --> 01:23:18.409
And she's talking union to them?

01:23:22.989 --> 01:23:24.411
They say she's made a porno movie

01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:28.161
with a local police
officer, very explicit.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.603
Show it to me. Run it for me.

01:23:32.682 --> 01:23:36.357
Oh, come on. There doesn't have to be a
movie, just people talk like there's one!

01:23:38.838 --> 01:23:41.341
The lady has an illegitimate child.

01:23:41.424 --> 01:23:43.017
She's slept around.

01:23:43.092 --> 01:23:45.015
She takes naps on your
bed late at night.

01:23:45.058 --> 01:23:46.525
- I don't believe this.
- Whaddaya mean ...

01:23:46.694 --> 01:23:50.442
I mean, are we in the union business or the
character assassination business?

01:23:50.517 --> 01:23:55.523
After I put in an 18-hour day, I suddenly
got the Legion of Decency on my hands here!

01:23:55.605 --> 01:23:58.199
Do you know that this woman has
broken her ass for this organization?

01:23:58.274 --> 01:24:01.027
She doesn't see her kids! She
doesn't have time to take a bath!

01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:04.034
What the hell do I care if she has round
heels. What is this, the Catholic Church?

01:24:04.113 --> 01:24:05.285
We're gonna canonize her?

01:24:05.365 --> 01:24:06.708
Hey, Ruben it's your game.

01:24:06.783 --> 01:24:07.863
You're goddamn right it is!

01:24:07.893 --> 01:24:09.571
- But we think she oughta go!
- Then make it stick!

01:24:09.583 --> 01:24:10.916
If you can't, get the hell outta here!

01:24:10.954 --> 01:24:12.581
Just get the hell
outta here anyway!

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.554
I'm sorry, Mrs. Webster.

01:24:28.638 --> 01:24:31.938
I don't wanna hurt the union, Reuben.
I'll quit if you want.

01:24:32.016 --> 01:24:35.086
What were you doing sleeping? You were
supposed to type some letters for me.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.652
Yeah.

01:25:03.506 --> 01:25:05.474
Hey. It's me, Norma.

01:25:07.218 --> 01:25:09.721
OK, it's I, Norma.
Will you forget the grammar?

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:12.023
Look, I gotta talk
to you right away.

01:25:16.477 --> 01:25:19.401
Maybe we could meet at my break.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.902
OK.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.660
Just talking to my kids. Make sure
they got home from school all right.

01:25:26.738 --> 01:25:30.368
Your kids are with my kids at
the grocery store buying candy.

01:25:32.493 --> 01:25:35.042
Maybe that's why my dentist
bills is busting me!

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.544
Uh!

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:41.359
Come on! Come on, boy!

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:44.965
Come here, boy!

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:47.926
You thinking union?

01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:52.200
You want union? You'll get union!
OK?

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:59.375
Come on, break it up!
Break it up!

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:01.177
Break it up!

01:26:10.907 --> 01:26:11.999
You all right?

01:26:12.075 --> 01:26:13.122
Yeah.

01:26:13.993 --> 01:26:15.495
What started this?

01:26:15.578 --> 01:26:18.532
They put up a letter telling the whites
the blacks are gonna take over the union,

01:26:18.615 --> 01:26:19.761
they gonna run it and push 'em around.

01:26:19.983 --> 01:26:22.516
And any time you tell a white man a
black man's gonna sit on his head,

01:26:22.565 --> 01:26:23.265
this is what you get.

01:26:23.336 --> 01:26:26.089
I love it when these pricks get mean.
We can take legal action.

01:26:26.172 --> 01:26:27.765
You get me the letter.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.639
I just can't waltz in there and take
it off the board. They're watching me.

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.061
How good is your memory?

01:26:32.136 --> 01:26:33.888
I still don't know the pledge
of allegiance to the flag.

01:26:33.971 --> 01:26:36.224
Get somebody to help you, write
it down a line at a time.

01:26:36.307 --> 01:26:39.026
Jeez, that reminds me of the time I
pinched a lipstick off the Five and dime.

01:26:39.102 --> 01:26:40.194
Did you get caught?

01:26:40.269 --> 01:26:43.117
- I went back next week for curlers.
- Then you know how to do it, kid.

01:27:13.469 --> 01:27:17.349
"Dominate it

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:21.403
and control it

01:27:21.477 --> 01:27:25.402
as you may

01:27:25.481 --> 01:27:28.826
see fit.

01:27:28.901 --> 01:27:31.825
If now ...

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.663
if now ..."

01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:39.037
Damn! Damn, damn, damn!

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:43.091
"you black employees are being
told that by going into the union

01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:46.716
in mass, you can dominate it
and control it in this plant

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:48.091
as you may see fit.

01:27:48.171 --> 01:27:50.265
If ..."

01:27:50.339 --> 01:27:51.591
Where's the rest of it?

01:27:51.674 --> 01:27:53.267
Well, that's all I could get.

01:27:53.342 --> 01:27:54.764
Mata Hari.

01:27:54.844 --> 01:27:56.687
Now, they was watching
us every single minute.

01:27:56.763 --> 01:27:59.708
It's the best chance we got to nail these
bastards, to catch 'em with their pants down.

01:27:59.783 --> 01:28:01.535
So don't tell me you
can't remember it.

01:28:01.618 --> 01:28:03.773
Sweetheart, you walk up
to it, you stand there

01:28:03.806 --> 01:28:06.306
and you copy it down, word
for word, line for line.

01:28:06.355 --> 01:28:07.751
You get me the date, you
get me the signature.

01:28:07.816 --> 01:28:10.349
You get it all, and you get
it back here to me. Come on.

01:28:10.526 --> 01:28:11.618
I'm gonna get fired.

01:28:11.694 --> 01:28:12.361
I'll run you a benefit.

01:28:12.437 --> 01:28:13.437
Oh, thanks a lot.

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:16.770
Hey! You wanna get massaged,
you go to a massage parlor!

01:28:16.949 --> 01:28:20.203
Either we get beat, or we
don't get beat. Come on!

01:28:21.954 --> 01:28:26.710
I got three kids, a drawerful of bills and
a husband who doesn't like what I'm doing.

01:28:26.793 --> 01:28:30.969
Now, I'll do it, but I don't need your
boot on my backside, Mr. Warshovsky.

01:28:31.647 --> 01:28:33.466
Reuben, I'm gonna tell you something.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:34.809
What are you gonna tell me, Norma?

01:28:34.884 --> 01:28:38.934
You been away from home a long time, you
been all business and you're getting crabby.

01:28:39.013 --> 01:28:42.233
Reuben, you need
yourself a woman.

01:28:43.392 --> 01:28:45.019
Funny you should mention it.

01:28:45.102 --> 01:28:47.355
Tonight's the night.

01:28:47.438 --> 01:28:48.940
Well, what would Dorothy say?

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:50.650
"Wear a rubber."

01:28:58.449 --> 01:28:59.666
You can't copy this letter!

01:28:59.742 --> 01:29:01.995
It's up on the bulletin board
and I'm going to copy it!

01:29:02.078 --> 01:29:04.126
You better not.

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:06.378
I'm gonna take down every
word of this letter.

01:29:06.457 --> 01:29:10.137
It's my break time and I'm gonna
take down every word of this letter.

01:29:10.419 --> 01:29:11.887
Just stay out of my way!

01:29:11.963 --> 01:29:13.886
I'm gonna take down every
word of this letter.

01:29:18.427 --> 01:29:19.849
Hello, Norma.

01:29:19.929 --> 01:29:22.648
Mr. Mason. You know who I am.

01:29:22.723 --> 01:29:25.476
Norma, put the pencil and paper away.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.938
You stop what you're
doing right now.

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.443
You're going to leave!

01:29:30.523 --> 01:29:34.369
The law's going to come after you and
take you right outta this plant!

01:29:34.443 --> 01:29:38.573
Mr. Mason, I started this,
and I'm gonna finish it.

01:29:40.616 --> 01:29:43.244
"Serious violence."

01:29:52.128 --> 01:29:54.551
Let's go to my office, Norma.

01:29:59.176 --> 01:30:02.897
Why did you make those personal
phone calls on company time?

01:30:09.812 --> 01:30:12.486
I want you all to spell
out your names for me.

01:30:15.026 --> 01:30:16.573
Don't be foolish, Norma Rae.

01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:21.995
Mr. Mason, no-one around
here is on my side,

01:30:22.074 --> 01:30:26.079
and I'm not gonna leave until I set down
all your names on this piece of paper.

01:30:26.162 --> 01:30:29.712
Lady, I want you off
the premises now!

01:30:30.499 --> 01:30:33.844
You phone your husband! You tell him
to come over here and fetch you!

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.968
I want you outta
here right quick!

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.292
Norma Rae.

01:31:05.368 --> 01:31:06.620
Forget it!

01:31:06.702 --> 01:31:08.796
I'm staying put!

01:31:08.871 --> 01:31:10.999
Right where I am!

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:17.388
It's gonna take you and
the police department

01:31:17.463 --> 01:31:19.215
and the fire department

01:31:19.298 --> 01:31:22.393
and the National Guard
to get me outta here!

01:31:24.261 --> 01:31:27.640
I'll wait for the sheriff
to come and take me home!

01:31:27.723 --> 01:31:30.897
And I ain't gonna budge
till he gets here!

01:34:08.801 --> 01:34:10.620
Come on down now, Norma Rae.

01:34:13.305 --> 01:34:15.228
Come on down now.

01:34:21.647 --> 01:34:24.070
You heard what I said.
Come on down.

01:34:38.038 --> 01:34:39.255
Lamar.

01:34:41.834 --> 01:34:46.965
I want you to put it in writing
that Sheriff Lamar Miller

01:34:47.047 --> 01:34:51.177
is gonna take Norma Rae
Webster straight home.

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:53.854
And I want you to sign it

01:34:53.929 --> 01:34:57.604
and I want you to hand it to me.

01:34:58.017 --> 01:34:59.769
Don't you tell me what to do, young lady.

01:34:59.852 --> 01:35:02.856
You're getting nothing
from me in writing.

01:35:03.165 --> 01:35:04.165
Mr. Mason?

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:05.900
You want her off the premises?

01:35:05.983 --> 01:35:07.530
Take her out.

01:35:09.278 --> 01:35:11.121
I don't know if I wanna
get in the same car

01:35:11.197 --> 01:35:12.970
with you and nobody else.

01:35:14.867 --> 01:35:18.292
Lamar, I ain't gonna bite you.

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.746
That's a police car!
You're taking me to jail!

01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:55.916
No! No! No!

01:35:55.991 --> 01:35:57.117
Quit that scrapping now!

01:35:57.201 --> 01:35:58.578
No! No!

01:35:58.661 --> 01:36:00.208
You're going to jail!

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:01.630
No!

01:36:01.705 --> 01:36:03.048
Get her in there.

01:36:03.123 --> 01:36:04.921
No! No!

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.674
No!

01:36:07.753 --> 01:36:09.255
Get in there now!

01:36:09.338 --> 01:36:10.430
No!

01:36:10.506 --> 01:36:11.758
Get her in.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.638
Get in there.

01:36:13.717 --> 01:36:15.185
No!

01:36:16.345 --> 01:36:17.813
Ahhh!

01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:19.853
No!

01:36:32.761 --> 01:36:34.786
Webster, Norma Rae.

01:36:35.265 --> 01:36:38.690
704 Priester Road, Henleyville.

01:36:39.868 --> 01:36:41.586
She's white.

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:44.123
Female, 31.

01:36:44.206 --> 01:36:46.834
Occupation: textile.

01:36:46.917 --> 01:36:51.339
Fair complexion, brown
hair, brown eyes.

01:36:51.422 --> 01:36:55.472
Arrest number: 2238B.

01:36:55.551 --> 01:36:59.096
Charge: disorderly conduct.

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:03.938
Norma Rae, you go with her now.

01:37:22.786 --> 01:37:24.788
Might as well sit down.

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:28.790
You got one phone call.

01:37:29.668 --> 01:37:31.420
Better call Sonny.

01:37:33.005 --> 01:37:35.474
I'll be calling my union organizer.

01:37:40.262 --> 01:37:43.266
I know the first time
you're in is bad.

01:38:01.367 --> 01:38:03.461
It comes with the job.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:12.094
I saw a pregnant woman
on a picket line

01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:14.888
get hit in the stomach with a club.

01:38:14.963 --> 01:38:18.388
I saw a boy of 16 get
shot in the back.

01:38:20.177 --> 01:38:22.555
I saw a guy get blown
to hell and back

01:38:22.638 --> 01:38:25.107
when he tried to start up
his car in the morning.

01:38:30.312 --> 01:38:33.156
And you just got your
feet wet on this one.

01:38:48.831 --> 01:38:51.425
Norma, you all right?

01:38:55.421 --> 01:38:57.844
I put the kids to bed.

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.813
Craig?

01:39:07.891 --> 01:39:08.983
Honey, wake up.

01:39:09.059 --> 01:39:10.561
It's Mama.

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:13.488
Wake up, sugar. I wanna talk to you.
Come on.

01:39:13.564 --> 01:39:16.238
Put your arms around my neck.

01:39:16.316 --> 01:39:18.694
Alice, wake up. Millie, wake up.

01:39:18.777 --> 01:39:20.620
I wanna talk to you, sweetheart.

01:39:20.696 --> 01:39:22.994
Come on in the living room.

01:39:24.324 --> 01:39:26.702
Come on. Atta girl.

01:39:49.892 --> 01:39:51.860
I love you, kids.

01:39:53.228 --> 01:39:55.697
That's the first thing.

01:39:56.899 --> 01:39:58.822
And Sonny loves you.

01:40:00.903 --> 01:40:03.326
You got the both of us.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.748
The second thing is

01:40:10.412 --> 01:40:12.835
I'm a jailbird.

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.923
Now, you're gonna
be hearing that

01:40:17.002 --> 01:40:19.471
and a lot of other things.

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:22.516
But you're gonna hear
it from me first.

01:40:27.971 --> 01:40:29.894
Millie.

01:40:29.973 --> 01:40:31.771
Your daddy.

01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:33.898
His name was Buddy Wilson.

01:40:33.977 --> 01:40:37.322
And he died four months
after you was born.

01:40:39.483 --> 01:40:40.951
Craig.

01:40:42.486 --> 01:40:45.660
I wasn't never married
to your daddy.

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:48.367
And he wasn't Buddy.

01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:50.748
And he's not Sonny.

01:40:50.827 --> 01:40:52.795
He's another man.

01:40:55.332 --> 01:40:58.427
And there have been
others in my life.

01:40:58.502 --> 01:41:01.972
You're gonna be hearing
about them, too.

01:41:03.173 --> 01:41:05.175
I'm not perfect.

01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:08.387
I made mistakes.

01:41:20.482 --> 01:41:23.907
Millie, these are
pictures of your daddy.

01:41:25.028 --> 01:41:27.656
Craig, I got pictures
of your daddy.

01:41:29.032 --> 01:41:31.000
They belong to you.

01:41:42.045 --> 01:41:45.140
If you go in the mill,

01:41:45.215 --> 01:41:49.140
I want life to be better
for you than it is for me.

01:41:52.055 --> 01:41:55.104
That's why I joined
up with the union

01:41:55.183 --> 01:41:57.686
and that's why I got fired for it.

01:42:00.439 --> 01:42:02.191
You understand me?

01:42:08.071 --> 01:42:09.948
Now, you kids,

01:42:11.408 --> 01:42:13.376
you know what I am.

01:42:15.037 --> 01:42:18.007
And you know that I believe

01:42:18.081 --> 01:42:21.051
in standing up for
what I think is right.

01:42:32.095 --> 01:42:34.894
Go to the bathroom before
you get back into bed.

01:42:36.099 --> 01:42:38.568
Take your pictures.

01:42:40.103 --> 01:42:41.571
Go on.

01:42:51.907 --> 01:42:53.935
I'll take a bath.

01:42:54.618 --> 01:42:57.087
There's lice in that jail.

01:43:09.091 --> 01:43:12.015
She had one call,
and she called you.

01:43:13.637 --> 01:43:16.106
She knew I could make bail.

01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:20.353
You come in here, you ...

01:43:20.435 --> 01:43:24.315
you mix her up, you turn
her head all around.

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:26.571
She's all changed.

01:43:28.652 --> 01:43:31.781
I didn't want that, I didn't
want her to be a front-runner.

01:43:36.785 --> 01:43:39.880
What's gonna happen to us now?

01:43:39.955 --> 01:43:41.298
She stood up on the table.

01:43:41.373 --> 01:43:43.341
She's a free woman.

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:46.546
Maybe you can live with it,
maybe you can't.

01:43:56.179 --> 01:43:58.273
Busted my shoelace.

01:44:00.308 --> 01:44:02.436
There's another one in the drawer.

01:44:02.519 --> 01:44:05.068
I busted that one last week.

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:15.995
Did you ever sleep with him?

01:44:16.074 --> 01:44:17.701
No.

01:44:20.162 --> 01:44:21.379
But he's in my head.

01:44:26.501 --> 01:44:30.506
I'm gonna see you
through getting tired,

01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:32.387
getting sick,

01:44:34.342 --> 01:44:36.310
getting old.

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:43.398
I'm gonna see you through
anything that comes up.

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:48.236
And there's nobody else in my head.

01:44:50.358 --> 01:44:51.860
Just you.

01:47:25.055 --> 01:47:29.481
Folks, ballots tabulated for
the O.P. Henley Company,

01:47:29.559 --> 01:47:33.689
against the union: 373.

01:47:56.086 --> 01:47:57.554
Folks,

01:48:00.423 --> 01:48:04.473
the count for the union: 427.

01:48:19.401 --> 01:48:21.403
We got it in!

01:48:22.278 --> 01:48:26.078
Union! Union! Union! Union!

01:48:27.325 --> 01:48:30.044
Union! Union! Union!

01:48:32.288 --> 01:48:35.007
Union! Union! Union!

01:48:40.922 --> 01:48:44.051
Union! Union! Union! Union!

01:48:44.134 --> 01:48:47.684
Union! Union! Union!

01:48:47.762 --> 01:48:51.187
Union! Union! Union!
Union! Union! Union!

01:48:59.357 --> 01:49:02.327
Union! Union! Union!
Union! Union! Union!

01:49:27.343 --> 01:49:29.186
You're gonna to drive
straight through?

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:31.606
Yes.

01:49:31.681 --> 01:49:34.059
Well, you better stop for
coffee, stay awake.

01:49:34.142 --> 01:49:36.440
I got a thermos in the car.

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:40.527
Well ...

01:49:42.358 --> 01:49:43.826
Well?

01:49:43.985 --> 01:49:45.237
Well.

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.367
Well.

01:49:46.988 --> 01:49:49.116
Ah, so.

01:49:49.199 --> 01:49:51.167
What are you gonna do now?

01:49:51.242 --> 01:49:53.336
Live. What else?

01:49:54.829 --> 01:49:57.503
Now, you drop me a
line once in a while, OK?

01:49:58.708 --> 01:50:00.381
Anyone read your mail?

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:02.462
Well, my mother.

01:50:06.174 --> 01:50:08.973
How about I send you a
copy of Dylan Thomas?

01:50:09.052 --> 01:50:11.976
I already bought one for myself.

01:50:12.055 --> 01:50:13.932
You did?

01:50:14.015 --> 01:50:16.643
Nobody can do anything
for you, huh?

01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:24.200
You've done something
for me, a lot.

01:50:27.195 --> 01:50:30.119
Well, you did something for us.

01:50:33.034 --> 01:50:34.786
A mitzvah.

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:38.753
- What's that?
- What is that?

01:50:39.457 --> 01:50:41.380
That's a good work.

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.890
I don't say goodbye.

01:50:46.965 --> 01:50:49.764
I have been known to cry.

01:50:49.843 --> 01:50:51.766
- Well, what do you say?
- Ahhh ...

01:50:53.721 --> 01:50:55.268
Be happy.

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:57.271
Be well.

01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:59.273
Same to you.

01:51:05.233 --> 01:51:08.328
Best wishes don't
seem hardly enough.

01:51:08.403 --> 01:51:09.871
I ...

01:51:09.946 --> 01:51:11.493
I'd like to thank you.

01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:16.077
I do.

01:51:16.161 --> 01:51:19.711
I thank you for your companionship,

01:51:19.789 --> 01:51:22.212
your stamina,

01:51:22.292 --> 01:51:25.594
your horse sense, and 101 laughs.

01:51:27.964 --> 01:51:31.013
I also enjoyed very much

01:51:31.092 --> 01:51:33.811
looking at your shining hair

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:35.605
and your shining face.

01:51:37.015 --> 01:51:39.859
Reuben, I think you like me.

01:51:41.311 --> 01:51:42.779
I do.

01:51:45.690 --> 01:51:48.409
I was gonna buy you a tie clip or
some shaving lotion or something,

01:51:48.484 --> 01:51:51.454
but I didn't know what you'd like.

01:51:53.156 --> 01:51:57.627
Norma, what I've had from
you has been sumptuous.

01:52:12.717 --> 01:52:18.395
Bless the child of a working man

01:52:18.473 --> 01:52:24.071
She knows too soon who she is

01:52:24.145 --> 01:52:30.073
And bless the hands of a working man

01:52:30.151 --> 01:52:35.908
He knows his soul is his

01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:38.789
So it goes like it goes

01:52:38.868 --> 01:52:40.586
Like the river flows

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:47.086
And time, it rolls right on

01:52:47.168 --> 01:52:50.012
And maybe what's good

01:52:50.088 --> 01:52:55.015
Gets a little bit better

01:52:55.093 --> 01:53:01.851
And maybe what's bad gets gone

01:53:08.356 --> 01:53:11.030
And it goes like it goes

01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:13.988
Like the river flows

01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:20.544
And time keeps rolling on

01:53:20.618 --> 01:53:23.963
And maybe what's good

01:53:24.038 --> 01:53:30.091
Gets a little bit better

01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:35.479
And maybe what's bad

01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:42.399
Gets gone
