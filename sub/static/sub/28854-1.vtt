01:04.846 --> 01:06.847
Are you finished yet?

01:06.849 --> 01:08.118
Mm-mm.

01:13.055 --> 01:17.023
Honey.
You can't fix everything...

01:17.025 --> 01:19.827
by staring at
a computer all night.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.595
I can't fix anything
right now.

01:21.597 --> 01:24.231
That's the problem.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.300
It's just a rough patch.

01:26.302 --> 01:29.606
Everyone in the construction
industry is in the same situation.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.872
Look, I'm not joking.

01:32.874 --> 01:35.342
I mean, I don't think we can
even make payroll anymore.

01:35.344 --> 01:38.845
If one more contract
doesn't go through...

01:38.847 --> 01:39.946
we're on the streets.

01:39.948 --> 01:41.949
Oh, you're overreacting,
honey.

01:41.951 --> 01:43.620
Hm. I wish.

01:48.056 --> 01:49.192
Do you like?

01:51.394 --> 01:53.963
It's beautiful, babe.
Yeah.

01:55.665 --> 01:58.098
Look, um, you're
gonna have to stop buying

01:58.100 --> 01:59.699
until further notice.

01:59.701 --> 02:00.870
Sorry.

02:06.242 --> 02:08.408
Fine.

02:08.411 --> 02:09.877
I can come into
the office tomorrow

02:09.878 --> 02:10.978
if you need my help.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.980
There's... There's no need.

02:12.982 --> 02:15.683
Thank you for offering,
but...

02:15.685 --> 02:18.785
nothing you can do
to help.

02:18.787 --> 02:22.657
Look, I promise things will
get back to normal soon.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.134
Hey, Jeannie!

02:33.136 --> 02:35.268
Stop pulling Tommy's shirt.

02:35.270 --> 02:37.137
Now!

02:37.139 --> 02:39.306
Ten years, that girl's
gonna be in jail.

02:39.308 --> 02:40.908
Mark my words.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.277
Nah. She's adorable.

02:43.279 --> 02:45.011
No, they all are.

02:45.013 --> 02:46.379
That's where we differ.

02:46.381 --> 02:48.349
I have good news.

02:48.351 --> 02:50.151
I got accepted.

02:50.153 --> 02:51.986
For what?

02:51.988 --> 02:55.056
That masters degree program
I told you about.

02:55.058 --> 02:56.824
In child development.

02:56.826 --> 02:59.927
Oh, right.
Yeah. Wow!

02:59.929 --> 03:01.729
I didn't realize you were
that serious about it.

03:01.731 --> 03:02.766
Of course.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.966
Avery!

03:08.937 --> 03:10.271
Are you okay?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.238
I'm fine.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.109
Mm. I know just the person
you need to see.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.279
Today.

03:17.345 --> 03:18.879
I see the pulpit.

03:18.881 --> 03:20.748
Where's the television studio?

03:20.750 --> 03:23.349
Uh, back of
the auditorium.

03:23.351 --> 03:25.018
Second floor.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.389
Mm.

03:29.726 --> 03:33.493
I've talked to a lot of
construction guys like you.

03:33.495 --> 03:36.330
They look at me and...

03:36.332 --> 03:41.802
see a little Baptist preacher
building an itsy bitsy church.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.403
What do you see,
Robert?

03:43.405 --> 03:45.306
A visionary.

03:45.308 --> 03:49.375
Who's building a five acre,
20,000 square foot sanctuary.

03:49.377 --> 03:50.410
You read my blog?

03:50.412 --> 03:52.079
I do my homework.

03:52.081 --> 03:55.216
Then you know my congregation
expects us to do business

03:55.218 --> 03:58.085
with people that share
our same values.

03:58.087 --> 03:59.820
Of course.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.825
So, what do you think?

04:15.904 --> 04:17.072
I think you got the job.

04:20.243 --> 04:22.810
We want you to build
our new church.

04:22.812 --> 04:24.844
Mr. Getz,
thank you so much.

04:24.846 --> 04:26.447
I promise,
you will not regret this.

04:26.449 --> 04:27.548
I'm counting on it,
Robert.

04:27.550 --> 04:28.916
All right.
Thank you.

04:28.918 --> 04:29.953
Thank you.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.226
So Morgan decided
that she was super woman,

04:39.228 --> 04:40.426
and guess what?

04:40.428 --> 04:42.061
She's not.

04:42.063 --> 04:43.830
Honestly, just give me
an ice pack,

04:43.832 --> 04:44.832
and I'll be fine.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.467
Not quite.

04:46.469 --> 04:48.435
You sprained your shoulder
pretty badly.

04:48.437 --> 04:52.205
So what you need is
a really good stretch. Okay?

04:52.207 --> 04:54.174
I promise,
Isabelle is the best.

04:54.176 --> 04:56.510
- Ahh.
- Oh, you're just biased.

04:56.512 --> 04:58.578
'Cause I gave you massages
all through high school.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.815
And I've been bringing you
business ever since.

05:00.817 --> 05:02.215
<i>Touch√©.</i>

05:02.217 --> 05:04.418
I wish my hubby would
give me a massage like this.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.553
- Mm-hm.
- So...

05:06.555 --> 05:08.022
how'd it go last night?

05:08.024 --> 05:09.556
Did you wear
the new lingerie?

05:09.558 --> 05:12.293
- Yes.
- And?

05:12.295 --> 05:15.029
And nothing.

05:15.031 --> 05:16.863
He has too much
going on right now.

05:16.865 --> 05:18.431
I told you.

05:18.433 --> 05:19.599
Once men get what they want,
they're done with us.

05:21.170 --> 05:22.602
And we're supposed to live
like Catholic nuns

05:22.604 --> 05:23.904
for the rest of our lives?

05:23.906 --> 05:25.573
That's my plan.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.241
So what about you?

05:27.243 --> 05:28.609
You have someone special
in your life?

05:28.611 --> 05:31.512
No special guy.

05:31.514 --> 05:32.549
Or girl.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.116
Or girl?

05:36.118 --> 05:39.288
Is that a hint
of some sort?

05:40.488 --> 05:43.224
Maybe.

05:44.894 --> 05:46.960
I doubt you let that
pretty face

05:46.962 --> 05:49.096
and beautiful body
go to waste.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.531
Trust me, she doesn't.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.498
She goes to that
club downtown.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.967
Secret Sins.

05:53.969 --> 05:57.570
What is that, like
a nightclub or something?

05:57.572 --> 06:00.173
Um... not really.

06:00.175 --> 06:03.878
It's a members only
adult club

06:03.880 --> 06:06.580
for people who aren't afraid
to have a little fun.

06:06.582 --> 06:11.385
You mean like young,
sexy people?

06:11.387 --> 06:13.186
I doubt they'll let me
through the door.

06:13.188 --> 06:15.058
Oh, don't
sell yourself short.

06:16.892 --> 06:18.424
Oh, gosh,
I just remembered.

06:18.426 --> 06:19.626
I have to call Robert.

06:19.628 --> 06:21.294
He had that very important
meeting today.

06:21.296 --> 06:24.231
Can you grab my phone
for me, please?

06:24.233 --> 06:26.532
I want to know
how it went.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.003
Oh, thank you.

06:30.005 --> 06:32.138
- Is that your husband?
- Mm-hm.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.173
Oh, you guys make
the cutest couple.

06:34.175 --> 06:36.911
Thank you.

06:36.913 --> 06:37.945
Do you have any children?

06:37.947 --> 06:39.947
A daughter. Abbey.

06:39.949 --> 06:43.284
She's so lucky to have
such beautiful parents.

06:43.286 --> 06:44.321
Thank you.

06:54.195 --> 06:55.596
Hello, hello.

06:55.598 --> 06:57.031
- Hi.
- How are you?

06:57.033 --> 06:59.065
Good. Hi.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.935
Thank you for coming.

07:02.538 --> 07:04.137
Oh, I want to be
in on that.

07:04.139 --> 07:05.940
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:06.976 --> 07:08.409
Oh!

07:08.411 --> 07:09.446
I'll be right back.

07:13.082 --> 07:16.416
Anna, hi.
Isabelle, I...

07:16.418 --> 07:18.419
I thought you wouldn't mind
if I brought Isabelle along.

07:18.421 --> 07:20.154
No, of course not.

07:20.156 --> 07:22.056
Come in.

07:22.058 --> 07:23.724
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:23.726 --> 07:26.159
Okay, now we can talk.

07:26.161 --> 07:27.197
Honey.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.630
I want to introduce you
to Isabelle.

07:30.632 --> 07:32.332
This is the woman that
gave me that great massage

07:32.334 --> 07:33.433
I told you about
the other day.

07:33.435 --> 07:35.068
Oh! So nice to meet you.

07:35.070 --> 07:38.171
The pleasure is
all mine, sweetheart.

07:38.173 --> 07:40.007
- Hey.
- Hey, Anna.

07:40.009 --> 07:41.541
- I need a drink.
- Oh, you know where it is.

07:41.543 --> 07:42.678
Ladies, this way.

07:46.449 --> 07:48.048
Uh, white wine,
Isabelle?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.149
- Sure.
- All right.

07:49.151 --> 07:50.450
- Thank you.
- You?

07:50.452 --> 07:53.020
- The usual.
- Bourbon it is.

07:53.022 --> 07:54.455
The house is
looking great, guys.

07:54.457 --> 07:57.024
I wish I lived in a copy of
"House Beautiful"

07:57.026 --> 07:59.226
where price is no object.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.626
Yeah. Come on, Anna,
you know that we're

08:00.628 --> 08:01.664
up to our eyeballs in debt.

08:04.099 --> 08:07.301
Yes, it's true,
but Robert landed a great contract,

08:07.303 --> 08:09.635
so quite frankly,
I'm not worried.

08:09.637 --> 08:11.438
Yeah, well, don't get
too comfortable.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.707
If anything goes wrong
with that great contract,

08:14.709 --> 08:17.077
company goes belly up
and all this goes away.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.246
Yeah, but you could go back to
programming, couldn't you?

08:19.248 --> 08:23.317
Why don't you
ask my wife

08:23.319 --> 08:26.152
how many times I've said
I'm sick of computers.

08:26.154 --> 08:29.022
Oh, my God, it's true.

08:29.024 --> 08:32.025
It's been so many years
since he's worked in computers.

08:32.027 --> 08:34.193
He's a construction guy now,
thank you very much.

08:34.195 --> 08:35.596
Yeah, I'm big
construction guy.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.197
- Told you about Avery.
- Mm-hm.

08:41.736 --> 08:43.736
All right,
enough of this now.

08:43.738 --> 08:45.371
- No, wait, I was doing something.
- I swear you love this thing

08:45.373 --> 08:46.807
- more than me.
- Hold on. No, wait, wait.

08:46.809 --> 08:49.476
Give it back.

08:49.478 --> 08:52.111
Abbey, honey,
it's getting late.

08:52.113 --> 08:54.581
Hey!

08:54.583 --> 08:55.618
Sorry, Mom.

09:00.555 --> 09:02.489
Just kids
having fun.

09:02.491 --> 09:04.757
- Right.
- And then they grow up and pay bills.

09:04.759 --> 09:06.260
Oh, come on!

09:06.262 --> 09:08.629
You guys are in
the prime of your lives.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.331
There's way more fun
to be had.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.466
Really?

09:12.468 --> 09:15.068
Like, what kind of fun?

09:15.070 --> 09:18.105
Come on. Tell us
all about this club.

09:18.107 --> 09:19.539
Secret Sins.

09:19.541 --> 09:23.780
Well, why tell you
when I could show you.

09:27.116 --> 09:28.481
Come on,
come out with me tonight.

09:28.483 --> 09:30.250
It'll be a lot of fun.

09:30.252 --> 09:31.485
Uh, cl...
What club?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.754
What are you
talking about?

09:33.756 --> 09:38.524
Isabelle is a member of
an adult only private club.

09:38.526 --> 09:41.227
Oh, I, uh...
No. You have to...

09:41.229 --> 09:42.563
You have to count us out.

09:42.565 --> 09:46.201
Oh, come on, relax.
You only live once.

09:47.703 --> 09:50.270
You are something else.

09:50.272 --> 09:52.271
I didn't say anything.

09:52.273 --> 09:54.374
Okay, I'll go.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.742
But only as an observer.

09:56.744 --> 09:58.578
Deal.

10:05.421 --> 10:06.623
Drivers licenses,
please.

10:08.891 --> 10:12.226
Club rules. All members
have to be registered.

10:12.228 --> 10:13.262
Here you go.

10:17.432 --> 10:18.600
It's okay.
It's not a big deal.

10:22.905 --> 10:25.172
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:25.174 --> 10:27.207
Don't worry.
After tonight,

10:27.209 --> 10:29.179
your husband will be
all over you.

10:32.547 --> 10:34.515
This is a one-time thing
for me.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.750
Okay.

12:03.906 --> 12:05.404
I have to admit,

12:05.406 --> 12:07.274
I didn't think
I'd have so much fun.

12:07.276 --> 12:09.509
See? Before I started
coming here,

12:09.511 --> 12:12.545
I was actually
incredibly shy.

12:12.547 --> 12:14.548
I could barely talk
to anybody.

12:14.550 --> 12:15.749
Give me a break.

12:15.751 --> 12:17.451
I'm serious.

12:17.453 --> 12:20.754
I was completely
out of touch with my...

12:20.756 --> 12:22.622
sensual side.

12:22.624 --> 12:24.691
I didn't even know
I had one, really.

12:24.693 --> 12:28.462
But now I'm
completely at ease.

12:28.464 --> 12:31.430
In fact,
I am not afraid to say

12:31.432 --> 12:34.703
that I find you both
extremely attractive.

12:35.771 --> 12:36.805
Thank you.

12:38.641 --> 12:40.874
Uh, the, uh,
feeling is mutual.

12:40.876 --> 12:43.776
So let me propose...

12:43.778 --> 12:46.746
that we spend
a little bit more...

12:46.748 --> 12:48.481
private time...

12:48.483 --> 12:49.882
just the three of us.

13:02.397 --> 13:03.730
Okay. Think about it.

13:03.732 --> 13:05.535
I'll be back with
some more tequila.

13:08.036 --> 13:10.569
Okay. You first.

13:10.571 --> 13:12.774
Why not?

13:16.411 --> 13:18.781
I mean, seriously,
why the hell not?

13:20.748 --> 13:24.818
Because we're married.
That's why not.

13:24.820 --> 13:27.520
And nothing's going to
change that.

13:27.522 --> 13:28.992
It's just
a little adventure.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.762
Would you feel the same way
if it was another man?

13:36.898 --> 13:39.732
Yeah, I could never share you
with another man.

13:39.734 --> 13:41.068
You're right.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.569
We are so not ready
for this right now.

13:45.574 --> 13:46.709
It was a nice thought,
though.

13:53.114 --> 13:54.850
I think you guys
need to get a room.

13:57.985 --> 13:59.885
Yeah.

13:59.887 --> 14:01.053
So?

14:01.055 --> 14:03.890
I'm sorry, Iz.
We talked about it,

14:03.892 --> 14:07.727
and I don't think we're ready
for a little private time.

14:07.729 --> 14:10.932
It's... It's just not us.

14:12.968 --> 14:14.668
Okay.

14:14.670 --> 14:16.403
That's okay.
I mean,

14:16.405 --> 14:17.540
it's not for everybody.

14:19.374 --> 14:21.741
No harm in asking,
right?

14:21.743 --> 14:22.911
Of course.

14:26.614 --> 14:28.981
But, um...

14:28.983 --> 14:32.119
this has made me want to,
uh, get her home

14:32.121 --> 14:33.956
as soon as possible.

14:35.391 --> 14:36.423
Okay.

14:37.759 --> 14:39.024
Thank you. Sorry.

14:39.026 --> 14:40.394
- Thank you.
- Bye.

14:40.396 --> 14:41.660
I'll call you tomorrow.

14:41.662 --> 14:43.099
Oh, and tell Anna
we said goodnight.

14:45.934 --> 14:48.568
You know,
you haven't kissed me

14:48.570 --> 14:51.505
the way you kissed me tonight
in a very, very long time.

14:51.507 --> 14:54.408
You liked that?

14:54.410 --> 14:56.842
You know I did.

14:56.844 --> 14:57.879
And...

15:00.148 --> 15:03.750
I don't need to go to
an adult only private club

15:03.752 --> 15:05.387
to enjoy the man I love.

15:08.589 --> 15:09.624
Pull over.

15:12.795 --> 15:13.894
Seriously?

15:13.896 --> 15:16.129
Mm-hm.

15:18.633 --> 15:19.668
Okay.

15:37.185 --> 15:39.388
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:41.089 --> 15:42.923
I'm so glad you could
meet me here today.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.857
Me, too. I...
I feel awful

15:44.859 --> 15:46.927
if I made you
uncomfortable last night.

15:46.929 --> 15:49.596
- It's okay.
- Okay.

15:49.598 --> 15:50.697
We had a great time.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.499
Good. So did I.

15:52.501 --> 15:54.937
You have to tell me how you got
involved with the lifestyle.

15:56.604 --> 15:57.438
Um...

16:01.509 --> 16:04.044
My ex boyfriend
introduced me to it.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.514
And, you know, initially...

16:07.516 --> 16:08.814
I wasn't even considering it,

16:08.816 --> 16:12.919
but I decided to just
let go of my inhibitions

16:12.921 --> 16:14.987
and have some fun.

16:14.989 --> 16:17.957
Wow.
So, does he go there?

16:17.959 --> 16:19.661
Do you see him?
Do you run into him?

16:22.230 --> 16:24.630
He, uh... He died.

16:24.632 --> 16:27.103
In an unfortunate accident.

16:32.007 --> 16:34.573
Uh, wow, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

16:34.575 --> 16:35.610
Thanks.

16:37.045 --> 16:38.845
Okay, well, um,

16:38.847 --> 16:40.614
I'm looking forward to
our friendship.

16:40.616 --> 16:42.215
Me, too.
Me, too.

16:42.217 --> 16:44.217
- Toast to that?
- New friends.

16:44.219 --> 16:45.588
Cheers.

17:46.882 --> 17:49.215
Sure. If it's okay with
her mom, it's fine with me.

17:49.217 --> 17:50.617
<i>Yeah,
she said it's fine.</i>

17:50.619 --> 17:52.686
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:52.688 --> 17:54.187
- Be good.
- <i>I will.</i>

17:54.189 --> 17:55.921
- And I love you.
- <i>Love you, Mom.</i>

17:55.923 --> 17:59.092
Mwah!

17:59.094 --> 18:00.994
Abbey has
a sleepover tonight.

18:00.996 --> 18:04.163
Oh. Sleepovers
can be fun.

18:06.101 --> 18:07.132
I have to use
the little girls room.

18:07.134 --> 18:08.802
Where is it again?

18:08.804 --> 18:10.836
Uh, it's the same place as
the little boys room is.

18:10.838 --> 18:12.072
It's down the hall
to the left.

18:12.074 --> 18:13.942
Perfect.
I'll be right back.

18:20.282 --> 18:23.082
- Happy?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:23.084 --> 18:24.918
For the first time
in a long time.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.719
You know,
business is good.

18:26.721 --> 18:28.723
Things seem to be
getting back on track.

18:30.057 --> 18:31.126
Good.

18:58.819 --> 19:00.820
Don't stop.

19:00.822 --> 19:02.024
I like what I see.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.280
Good morning.

21:07.282 --> 21:08.718
Good morning, honey.

21:20.996 --> 21:23.032
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

21:24.332 --> 21:27.100
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

21:27.102 --> 21:29.902
I don't know about you guys,
but after last night,

21:29.904 --> 21:32.338
I am famished.

21:32.340 --> 21:33.743
Mm.

21:37.112 --> 21:39.312
Okay.

21:39.314 --> 21:42.549
I don't know how to say this,
so, um...

21:42.551 --> 21:45.217
I'm just gonna say it.

21:45.219 --> 21:47.286
I've fallen in love.

21:47.288 --> 21:48.490
With both of you.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.228
It's true, I've fallen
in love with both of you.

21:55.162 --> 21:57.863
Isabelle,
you're beautiful,

21:57.865 --> 22:00.300
but last night
was just...

22:00.302 --> 22:01.868
It was... It was
an adventure.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.538
A one time adventure.

22:06.540 --> 22:10.843
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but whenever we're together,

22:10.845 --> 22:14.380
I... I just feel like
I'm at home.

22:14.382 --> 22:17.283
I mean, imagine us
loving each other.

22:17.285 --> 22:19.585
Living as a family.

22:19.587 --> 22:22.589
Oh, it could be
so beautiful.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.623
Robert and I
already have a family,

22:24.625 --> 22:26.828
one that we're
very happy with.

22:28.863 --> 22:30.298
I'm sorry.

22:31.866 --> 22:34.633
No, I...
There I go again.

22:34.635 --> 22:37.370
Assuming things.
Um...

22:37.372 --> 22:40.342
I'm sorry, I'll just...
I'll go.

22:41.977 --> 22:43.376
You don't have to leave.

22:43.378 --> 22:45.078
Oh, God.

22:51.952 --> 22:54.387
<i>Robert and I
already have a family,</i>

22:54.389 --> 22:56.322
<i>one that we're
very happy with.</i>

22:56.324 --> 22:57.957
I already have a family,

22:57.959 --> 22:59.394
one I am very happy with.

23:03.230 --> 23:06.599
- Eva, we have to go.
- I don't want to go.

23:06.601 --> 23:08.267
We'll find you
another family.

23:08.269 --> 23:09.601
- No.
- Let's go.

23:09.603 --> 23:10.969
It's time to go.

23:10.971 --> 23:12.307
Come on.

23:30.592 --> 23:32.492
<i>Robert and I
already have a family,</i>

23:32.494 --> 23:35.561
<i>one that we're
very happy with.</i>

23:35.563 --> 23:36.963
Okay.

23:36.965 --> 23:38.000
Okay.

23:41.068 --> 23:42.968
<i>I gave myself
to both of you,</i>

23:42.970 --> 23:44.970
<i>and you rejected me.</i>

23:44.972 --> 23:46.538
<i>Me?</i>

23:48.677 --> 23:52.011
<i>You are missing out on the greatest
thing that ever happened to you.</i>

23:52.013 --> 23:53.582
<i>You will pay for this.</i>

23:56.418 --> 23:58.418
<i>No one turns me away.</i>

23:58.420 --> 24:00.890
<i>I will destroy you!</i>

24:38.759 --> 24:41.361
I... I want to apologize.

24:41.363 --> 24:44.999
No, I wanted to.
Please, come in.

24:48.569 --> 24:51.470
So I owe you
a big thank you.

24:51.472 --> 24:53.672
You saved our marriage.

24:53.674 --> 24:54.707
I did?

24:54.709 --> 24:57.243
Absolutely.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.611
Robert and I
have reconnected.

24:58.613 --> 25:01.480
That's great.
I'm really happy for you.

25:01.482 --> 25:04.082
So I'm really sorry I hurt
your feelings this morning.

25:04.084 --> 25:06.185
No, it's... it's okay.

25:06.187 --> 25:08.053
- Really.
- Really?

25:08.055 --> 25:09.391
Promise.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.227
Oh, hey, um...

25:15.229 --> 25:16.728
I lost one of my earrings.

25:16.730 --> 25:19.297
Is it okay if I go upstairs
to see if it's up there?

25:19.299 --> 25:20.702
- Of course.
- Okay.

26:04.645 --> 26:05.844
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

26:05.846 --> 26:07.679
So I found this
in the VIP.

26:07.681 --> 26:09.148
You should probably
give him a call.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.851
- Right away.
- Thank you.

26:18.526 --> 26:19.561
Thank you.

26:31.206 --> 26:32.671
Hello?

26:32.673 --> 26:34.540
<i>Hi. Hi, this is Diane
from Secret Sins.</i>

26:34.542 --> 26:36.309
<i>I found your credit card.</i>

26:36.311 --> 26:38.678
I hardly ever carry that card.
Where did you say you found it?

26:38.680 --> 26:40.345
<i>Well, it doesn't matter.
It's in lost and found,</i>

26:40.347 --> 26:42.247
<i>and we've
got it here for you.</i>

26:42.249 --> 26:44.684
Uh, yeah, I must have dropped
it there the other night.

26:44.686 --> 26:45.851
<i>That's okay.
You can come down...</i>

26:45.853 --> 26:47.352
Um, yeah, I'll...
I'll be there

26:47.354 --> 26:49.421
as soon as I can
to get it. All right.

26:49.423 --> 26:50.725
- <i>Great. We'll have it here for you.</i>
- Thank you.

27:09.611 --> 27:12.277
Hey, I, uh... I left a credit
card here the other night.

27:12.279 --> 27:13.845
Robert DeAngelo.

27:13.847 --> 27:15.584
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

27:21.322 --> 27:22.721
- Robert.
- Yes.

27:22.723 --> 27:24.292
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

27:28.763 --> 27:30.830
Hey, do you
come here often?

27:30.832 --> 27:33.466
Uh, no, no, I don't.
I've only been here one time before.

27:33.468 --> 27:34.900
- One time?
- Do you want to dance?

27:34.902 --> 27:36.636
No, I just came here
to get a lost credit card.

27:36.638 --> 27:38.537
- I have to go.
- Oh, come on.

27:38.539 --> 27:40.339
Oh, I... I can't dance.

27:40.341 --> 27:41.740
- Oh, sure you can.
- I'm the worst.

27:41.742 --> 27:43.909
Show me
some of those moves.

27:46.447 --> 27:49.181
You're so delicious.

27:49.183 --> 27:50.615
I have to go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:50.617 --> 27:51.883
I have to go.
I have to go.

27:51.885 --> 27:53.252
Thank you, though.
Bye.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.289
- Bye.
- Thank you.

28:00.361 --> 28:02.794
- Thank you ladies.
- Thank you.

28:11.805 --> 28:12.938
When I was younger, I...

28:12.940 --> 28:14.473
I didn't always
look like this.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.641
I was really overweight.

28:16.643 --> 28:19.245
Oh, come on.
You were born beautiful.

28:19.247 --> 28:21.249
No, I wasn't.

28:27.689 --> 28:29.455
But anyway...

28:29.457 --> 28:31.323
you look amazing.

28:31.325 --> 28:33.359
Thank you.

28:33.361 --> 28:36.228
Although I'm sure Robert would
prefer me a little thinner.

28:36.230 --> 28:40.533
No, he loves you
just the way you are.

28:40.535 --> 28:41.900
So do I.

28:41.902 --> 28:43.636
What's wrong?

28:43.638 --> 28:45.470
Nothing.

28:45.472 --> 28:48.640
I really am happy
for you guys.

28:48.642 --> 28:51.009
I mean, I...

28:51.011 --> 28:53.411
wish it would have been me.

28:53.413 --> 28:55.614
But I am happy that
you decided to embrace

28:55.616 --> 28:58.417
the open marriage policy.

28:58.419 --> 29:00.553
What are you talking about?

29:00.555 --> 29:03.389
Oh...

29:03.391 --> 29:04.990
Wow, I... I thought you knew.

29:04.992 --> 29:06.524
Knew what?

29:06.526 --> 29:09.794
I saw Robert
at the club last night.

29:09.796 --> 29:11.363
There were women all over him.

29:11.365 --> 29:13.698
He looked like he was having
a really good time.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.333
No.

29:15.335 --> 29:16.968
No way.

29:16.970 --> 29:18.737
Robert's not that kind of guy.

29:18.739 --> 29:20.538
I mean, he and I
have problems,

29:20.540 --> 29:24.276
but he has always
been faithful.

29:24.278 --> 29:25.710
If you say so.

29:25.712 --> 29:27.713
When I was at
the club last night...

29:27.715 --> 29:32.418
and please forgive me if
I've overstepped my bounds...

29:32.420 --> 29:35.987
but I took some pictures.

29:35.989 --> 29:37.625
I really thought
you should know.

29:45.866 --> 29:47.399
I've seen it before.

29:47.401 --> 29:48.700
Seen what before?

29:48.702 --> 29:51.836
The perfect husband.
Straight arrow guy.

29:51.838 --> 29:54.939
You know, he gets
a taste of the club and...

29:54.941 --> 29:56.042
just loses control.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.409
That's not Robert.

29:57.411 --> 29:59.544
Okay?

29:59.546 --> 30:02.081
Do me a favor.
Text me these pictures,

30:02.083 --> 30:04.917
and then delete them.

30:04.919 --> 30:06.619
I'm gonna go
take care of this right now.

30:06.621 --> 30:08.053
I hope you don't mind.
Excuse me.

30:08.055 --> 30:09.924
Okay, I'm...
I'm sorry.

30:12.626 --> 30:13.661
No, I'm not.

30:15.830 --> 30:16.928
Morgan! Hi.

30:16.930 --> 30:18.797
Uh, Robert is
really busy.

30:18.799 --> 30:20.932
Sandy, please.

30:20.934 --> 30:23.869
Construction starts
next week.

30:25.506 --> 30:27.840
Uh, yes, sir.
All right.

30:27.842 --> 30:29.374
Uh, th-thank you,
thank you so much, Mr. Getz.

30:29.376 --> 30:30.743
All right.
And... And thank you again

30:30.745 --> 30:32.378
for this
fantastic opportunity.

30:32.380 --> 30:34.412
All right. Bye.

30:34.414 --> 30:36.748
Babe, what's wrong?
Is Abbey okay?

30:36.750 --> 30:38.083
- Did something happen?
- Abbey's just fine.

30:38.085 --> 30:40.453
But you decided to have
a little fun last night.

30:40.455 --> 30:41.687
Fun?

30:41.689 --> 30:42.987
What... What kind of fun?
What do you mean?

30:42.989 --> 30:44.523
Oh, please.
I just had lunch with Isabelle.

30:44.525 --> 30:45.957
- She told me everything.
- Babe, slow down.

30:45.959 --> 30:47.826
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:47.828 --> 30:50.731
Why didn't you tell me you
went to Secret Sins last night?

30:53.633 --> 30:55.501
Oh... Oh, for God's sake, no.
The club called.

30:55.503 --> 30:56.835
Apparently,
when we were there,

30:56.837 --> 30:58.003
my credit card
dropped out of my wallet,

30:58.005 --> 30:59.071
and so I went back to get it.

30:59.073 --> 31:00.739
Really?

31:00.741 --> 31:01.843
Then what is this?

31:03.777 --> 31:04.976
Isabelle saw you.

31:04.978 --> 31:06.778
She took pictures of you.

31:06.780 --> 31:09.114
It looks like you and your lady
friends were having a blast.

31:09.116 --> 31:10.716
Babe, I went there to get
a lost credit card,

31:10.718 --> 31:12.485
and those girls
jumped me. Okay?

31:12.487 --> 31:13.986
You know the kind of thing
that happens at that place.

31:13.988 --> 31:15.487
So why did you have to
go by yourself?

31:15.489 --> 31:17.590
It... It was on the way
from the office.

31:17.592 --> 31:19.557
So you could have just cancelled
the card and got a new one.

31:19.559 --> 31:21.627
You're acting crazy.
Nothing happened.

31:21.629 --> 31:22.794
I'm not acting crazy.

31:22.796 --> 31:24.964
You know what?
I'm not buying it.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.668
Sell it to someone else.

31:32.172 --> 31:34.607
Of course
I wasn't spying on you.

31:34.609 --> 31:35.874
<i>Well, then,
why'd you take the photos?</i>

31:35.876 --> 31:37.409
I honestly thought that

31:37.411 --> 31:39.544
you and Morgan had
opened your marriage.

31:39.546 --> 31:41.647
I... I thought that
she would enjoy the photos.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.047
Yeah, well, she didn't.

31:43.049 --> 31:45.117
And now, thanks to you,
our marriage is in trouble.

31:45.119 --> 31:46.518
<i>I swear,
I would never do anything</i>

31:46.520 --> 31:47.686
to hurt either of you.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.921
I... I guess I just...

31:49.923 --> 31:51.090
I wasn't thinking.

31:51.092 --> 31:53.525
Yeah, obviously.

31:53.527 --> 31:55.026
Things are just really
difficult over here right now.

31:55.028 --> 31:56.795
I... I don't have
a lot of appointments,

31:56.797 --> 31:58.863
and... and I'm just...
I'm kind of freaking out,

31:58.865 --> 32:00.765
so would...
would you please just...

32:00.767 --> 32:03.569
please just forgive me.

32:03.571 --> 32:05.470
Okay, look, calm...
calm down, okay?

32:05.472 --> 32:07.172
Look, I'll talk to
Morgan tonight,

32:07.174 --> 32:08.908
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

32:08.910 --> 32:10.876
Just no more photos,
okay?

32:10.878 --> 32:13.978
I swear, I promise,
no more photos.

32:13.980 --> 32:15.948
All right, things will
get better for you.

32:15.950 --> 32:17.850
Business moves
in cycles so...

32:17.852 --> 32:20.553
You're right.
It does.

32:20.555 --> 32:21.920
Okay, well,
I have to go.

32:21.922 --> 32:23.024
<i>Yeah, bye.</i>

32:26.960 --> 32:29.527
Hm.

32:35.001 --> 32:36.101
Miss Anderson.

32:36.103 --> 32:38.102
Is that leg
still bothering you?

32:38.104 --> 32:39.471
Come on.

32:39.473 --> 32:41.809
Let's take care of that,
shall we?

32:43.510 --> 32:44.909
I want to believe you,
I really do.

32:44.911 --> 32:47.783
Well, have I ever given you
a reason to doubt me?

32:50.551 --> 32:52.150
Not yet.

32:52.152 --> 32:54.687
Well?

32:54.689 --> 32:56.255
Well?

32:56.257 --> 32:57.857
You don't seem to have
any interest in me

32:57.859 --> 33:00.059
unless there's
another woman involved.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.995
That's not fair.

33:02.997 --> 33:05.230
And also, you know,

33:05.232 --> 33:07.032
it's normal that
a couple's sex life

33:07.034 --> 33:08.633
slows down a little bit
as they get older.

33:08.635 --> 33:09.869
It's just normal.

33:09.871 --> 33:11.836
Well, I can't understand
"slows down,"

33:11.838 --> 33:13.973
but completely
disappears?

33:13.975 --> 33:16.976
I mean, I don't know
what else to do.

33:21.982 --> 33:24.082
I don't either.

33:24.084 --> 33:26.017
So, on the one hand,

33:26.019 --> 33:27.953
he's probably telling
the truth.

33:27.955 --> 33:30.890
But on the other,
I still don't understand

33:30.892 --> 33:32.494
why he went there
by himself.

33:34.895 --> 33:37.228
Well, honey,
instead of replaying it

33:37.230 --> 33:39.198
over and over again
in your head,

33:39.200 --> 33:42.167
why don't you just
go to the club...

33:42.169 --> 33:43.768
by yourself,

33:43.770 --> 33:45.537
and give him a taste
of his own medicine?

33:45.539 --> 33:47.072
Oh, I can never do that.

33:47.074 --> 33:48.910
Hell, yes, you can.

33:50.545 --> 33:52.714
I am a one-man woman.

33:54.081 --> 33:55.950
I've never strayed
in 20 years.

33:57.817 --> 33:59.017
Girl, you need a double.

34:00.654 --> 34:03.755
I mean, seriously,
just go.

34:03.757 --> 34:05.123
Do it.

34:05.125 --> 34:06.324
Give him a taste
of his own medicine.

34:06.326 --> 34:07.960
You know,
I can't figure out

34:07.962 --> 34:09.594
if you're a good influence
or a bad one.

34:09.596 --> 34:12.130
Oh, bad.
Definitely bad.

34:15.636 --> 34:18.036
Okay, fine.
I'll go.

34:18.038 --> 34:20.806
And I'm gonna be the hottest
girl on the dance floor.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.206
Hell yes!

34:22.208 --> 34:23.942
- Great.
- Yes!

34:41.062 --> 34:44.029
See? This is
what I'm talking about.

34:44.031 --> 34:46.364
There is nothing better...

34:46.366 --> 34:48.002
than people looking at you.

34:50.605 --> 34:52.040
Wanting you.

34:52.906 --> 34:54.839
Nothing.

34:54.841 --> 34:56.208
Well, you're used to this,

34:56.210 --> 34:58.611
but it's gonna take
some time for me.

34:58.613 --> 35:01.145
Hey, you guys, can I get
a shot for table five?

35:03.951 --> 35:06.217
So what are we
gonna do now?

35:06.219 --> 35:09.922
Well, you just stand here
and look sexy,

35:09.924 --> 35:13.759
and I'll go get us
a couple of drinks.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.263
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

35:52.265 --> 35:53.332
- Excuse...
- Hey!

35:53.334 --> 35:55.067
Where are you goin'?

35:55.069 --> 35:56.969
This isn't for me,
Isabelle, I'm sorry.

35:56.971 --> 35:58.337
Robert thinks
we're at the movies,

35:58.339 --> 36:00.004
and I think that's
what we should do.

36:00.006 --> 36:01.642
Just stay for the one drink.

36:02.810 --> 36:05.777
- Okay, just one.
- Okay.

36:05.779 --> 36:07.980
To friendship.

36:07.982 --> 36:09.013
To friendship.

37:09.176 --> 37:11.212
- Hey.
- Oh...

37:14.247 --> 37:15.948
Where am I?

37:15.950 --> 37:17.982
I'm taking you home,
sweetie.

37:17.984 --> 37:20.419
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

37:20.421 --> 37:23.187
You could have gone
all night.

37:23.189 --> 37:25.924
You put on quite a show
back there.

37:25.926 --> 37:29.862
Uh, what kind of show?

37:29.864 --> 37:33.966
Well, first there was one guy.

37:33.968 --> 37:36.234
Then two.

37:36.236 --> 37:38.038
Oh! It was hot.

37:38.906 --> 37:41.940
Hot as in sex hot?

37:41.942 --> 37:44.076
Yeah.

37:45.178 --> 37:47.346
You were supposed to
have my back.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.013
I did!

37:49.015 --> 37:51.350
You kept telling me
you were fine.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.417
That you finally felt free.

37:53.419 --> 37:55.322
Oh, stop the car.

37:57.357 --> 37:59.257
What wr...

37:59.259 --> 38:01.460
Honey, you are in no condition
to get out of the car.

38:01.462 --> 38:03.898
- Open the door.
- Okay, okay.

38:13.908 --> 38:15.777
Take me home, please.

38:17.111 --> 38:18.277
Oh...

38:18.279 --> 38:20.145
You okay?

38:28.589 --> 38:30.522
I don't know
how it happened.

38:30.524 --> 38:33.225
I'm not here to judge.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.261
I'm here to help.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.299
Any idea how many partners
you had that night?

38:48.375 --> 38:53.045
Well, the STD results should
be back within 24 hours.

38:53.047 --> 38:56.317
In the meantime,
stay out of trouble.

38:58.986 --> 39:00.618
Oh, God.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.254
And how's Abbey doing?

39:02.256 --> 39:03.924
Abbey's good.
Thank you for asking.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.073
Yeah. Uh...

39:28.348 --> 39:31.149
Uh, I think I forgot
my phone in the store.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.821
- I'll meet you at the car.
- Okay. All right.

39:46.366 --> 39:48.165
Isabelle. Hi.

39:48.167 --> 39:50.301
I was just out
shopping with...

39:50.303 --> 39:53.304
Anna. I know.
I saw.

39:53.306 --> 39:55.172
I tried calling you.

39:55.174 --> 39:56.308
You mad or something?

39:56.310 --> 39:59.011
What do you think?

39:59.013 --> 40:00.978
I should have never let you
take me to the club that night.

40:00.980 --> 40:03.147
I would have never done
the things you said I did.

40:03.149 --> 40:05.283
Look, you just got
caught up in the moment.

40:05.285 --> 40:06.518
You were having fun,
that's all.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.085
How could you even say that?

40:08.087 --> 40:10.087
I'm a married woman.

40:10.089 --> 40:11.625
It's like I was drugged
or something.

40:13.393 --> 40:16.995
And it's caused huge problems
for me and Robert.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.297
I even had to get
an STD test.

40:19.299 --> 40:22.500
Look, why don't you,
Robert and I just...

40:22.502 --> 40:24.368
sit down and have
a conversation.

40:24.370 --> 40:26.538
Like a family.
It'll be fine.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.308
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

40:29.310 --> 40:32.145
In fact, I don't think you and
I should hang out for a while.

40:33.580 --> 40:35.346
Hey, Isabelle.
We just finished shopping

40:35.348 --> 40:36.517
if you want to come
join us for coffee.

40:38.451 --> 40:40.319
Nah, I'm good.

40:40.321 --> 40:43.054
You girls have fun.

40:43.056 --> 40:44.125
Okay.

41:08.982 --> 41:10.584
Honey,
dinner's getting cold.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.174
I can explain.

41:36.176 --> 41:38.342
You can explain an STD test?

41:38.344 --> 41:42.214
Well, I was so damn upset that you
went to the club the other night

41:42.216 --> 41:43.748
that I just
wanted to make sure

41:43.750 --> 41:46.283
I didn't catch anything
from you.

41:46.285 --> 41:47.486
What?

41:47.488 --> 41:48.786
Well, how do I know
what you did

41:48.788 --> 41:50.321
after you picked up
your credit card.

41:50.323 --> 41:52.324
There was two women
all over you

41:52.326 --> 41:55.359
in that picture that I saw.

41:55.361 --> 41:58.029
We've been married how long,

41:58.031 --> 42:01.500
and you think that I would
do that to you?

42:01.502 --> 42:03.335
Really?

42:03.337 --> 42:04.405
I don't know.

42:10.544 --> 42:12.511
Well, the good news is that
I don't have an STD,

42:12.513 --> 42:14.082
which means
you don't either.

42:18.652 --> 42:21.420
You never did.

42:21.422 --> 42:22.657
Oh, my...

42:39.339 --> 42:40.475
- Ooh!
- Oh!

42:47.547 --> 42:49.147
I don't know.

42:49.149 --> 42:51.018
Someone said two guys
and their girlfriends.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.880
Bartender, I think we need
a couple drinks over here.

43:22.882 --> 43:25.583
Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

43:33.426 --> 43:35.659
Come on!

43:40.901 --> 43:42.136
Yes.

43:49.343 --> 43:50.377
It's all good.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.478
Big meeting today.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.745
We're gonna finalize plans
for the church,

45:01.747 --> 45:03.547
- so wish me luck.
- Good luck, honey.

45:03.549 --> 45:06.384
But... food?

45:06.386 --> 45:07.919
- Off to school.
- I love you, honey.

45:07.921 --> 45:10.355
Food? Breakfast?

45:10.357 --> 45:11.726
- Love you.
- Have a good day.

45:23.536 --> 45:26.437
Oh, my God.

45:30.944 --> 45:32.647
Oh, no.

45:33.614 --> 45:35.879
This can't be happening.

45:35.881 --> 45:38.650
What is this?

45:46.660 --> 45:48.196
Oh, my God.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.636
Robert.

45:57.904 --> 45:59.404
We are down to the wire,

45:59.406 --> 46:01.473
so whatever it is,
it can wait.

46:01.475 --> 46:02.973
Actually...

46:02.975 --> 46:04.211
this can't.

46:18.725 --> 46:20.025
Has Mr. Getz called?

46:20.027 --> 46:21.592
Not yet.

46:21.594 --> 46:23.560
But the potential clients
that we lined up

46:23.562 --> 46:24.862
because of the church job,

46:24.864 --> 46:26.730
they all cancelled
their appointments.

46:26.732 --> 46:28.400
Every one.

46:28.402 --> 46:30.634
I told them that someone
is trying to hurt you.

46:30.636 --> 46:31.935
I know this can't be true.

46:31.937 --> 46:33.404
Of course it's not.

46:33.406 --> 46:36.507
This is somebody's idea
of a sick joke.

46:36.509 --> 46:38.710
Who's seen this?

46:38.712 --> 46:41.449
Um...
Everyone.

46:42.582 --> 46:44.848
Tell 'em to
get back to work.

46:44.850 --> 46:45.885
Okay.

46:58.765 --> 47:00.931
Isabelle!

47:10.710 --> 47:14.511
My whole life is destroyed.

47:14.513 --> 47:15.679
Your life?

47:17.017 --> 47:19.817
All of my patients
cancelled their appointments.

47:19.819 --> 47:21.419
How am I gonna pay rent?

47:21.421 --> 47:23.687
I'm gonna lose everything.

47:23.689 --> 47:26.293
I thought you're the one
that posted that list.

47:27.694 --> 47:29.694
Why would I have
posted that list?

47:29.696 --> 47:31.895
My name was on it.

47:31.897 --> 47:34.998
That's my private life.
I don't just share that with anybody.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.902
This can't be happening.
Oh, my God.

47:38.904 --> 47:40.807
Somebody is out to ruin us.

47:44.477 --> 47:46.844
Oh, my God.

47:46.846 --> 47:49.582
Do Abbey and Robert know?

47:50.984 --> 47:52.817
When they left this morning,
they didn't know,

47:52.819 --> 47:54.085
but I'm sure
they know by now.

47:54.087 --> 47:55.853
I'm sure everybody knows.

47:55.855 --> 47:58.823
It's... It's out there.

47:58.825 --> 48:00.658
We're gonna be okay.

48:00.660 --> 48:02.627
And you know why?

48:02.629 --> 48:04.565
Because we have each other.

48:05.698 --> 48:07.165
Okay?

48:07.167 --> 48:08.469
Okay.

48:17.643 --> 48:19.009
It's a sad day
for all of us.

48:19.011 --> 48:21.011
Look, Mr. Getz,
I can assure you,

48:21.013 --> 48:22.980
there's been some sort of
terrible mistake.

48:22.982 --> 48:24.815
- I'll say.
- Look, my wife and I,

48:24.817 --> 48:26.618
all we did is
is we went dancing there.

48:26.620 --> 48:28.853
Somebody clearly edited that
video to make her look that way.

48:28.855 --> 48:31.022
We had such high hopes
when we came to you.

48:31.024 --> 48:32.656
We were sure you were
the right man for the job.

48:32.658 --> 48:34.759
I am.

48:34.761 --> 48:37.562
No, we can't be in business with
people that don't share our values.

48:37.564 --> 48:39.196
Look, Mr. Getz, come on.

48:39.198 --> 48:42.833
We... We've been working on
the blueprints for weeks now.

48:42.835 --> 48:46.136
We are ready to make you
the most beautiful church.

48:46.138 --> 48:48.839
And you expect my congregation
to flock to a house of God

48:48.841 --> 48:50.074
that's been built by a man

48:50.076 --> 48:53.444
whose wife has sex
with other men?

48:53.446 --> 48:55.879
On camera.

48:55.881 --> 48:58.482
I had so many plans for us.
What a disappointment.

48:58.484 --> 49:01.986
Look, I... I'm no expert
on the Bible,

49:01.988 --> 49:03.924
but I know that it
talks about forgiveness.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.963
Do not quote scripture
to me, son.

49:25.779 --> 49:28.179
I can't go back to school.

49:28.181 --> 49:30.781
They'll just laugh at me
'til graduation day.

49:30.783 --> 49:33.150
Oh, look, it's Abbey.
You know what her mom is.

49:33.152 --> 49:35.553
No doubt she'll follow
in her footsteps.

49:35.555 --> 49:38.823
Abbey, honey,
it's not what it seems.

49:38.825 --> 49:41.692
Really? 'Cause from the videos
everyone's seen,

49:41.694 --> 49:44.761
it's pretty clear it's
exactly what it seems.

49:44.763 --> 49:47.866
Abbey, I don't remember
any of it.

49:47.868 --> 49:50.734
I swear. It's like I was
drugged or something.

49:50.736 --> 49:53.740
I don't know, but your mom would
never do something like that.

49:54.841 --> 49:56.176
But you did.

50:01.181 --> 50:02.883
People make mistakes.

50:06.252 --> 50:09.254
Joey broke up with me today
because of your mistakes.

50:09.256 --> 50:11.154
I'm sorry.

50:11.156 --> 50:13.993
What do I have now,
a mom who's a perv?

50:15.227 --> 50:17.694
What would you have said
if I had done it?

50:17.696 --> 50:19.531
I'm sorry.

50:19.533 --> 50:21.000
Don't touch me.

50:29.910 --> 50:31.708
Oh, my God.

50:56.169 --> 50:57.234
Where are you going?

50:57.236 --> 50:59.837
Why do you care?

50:59.839 --> 51:01.542
Don't talk to me
like that.

51:06.078 --> 51:07.911
I'll be at Stacy's.

51:07.913 --> 51:11.281
She said I could stay there
'til this all blows over.

51:11.283 --> 51:13.620
Who knows how long
that'll take.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.540
I saw the video.

51:34.040 --> 51:35.942
Babe, I'm sorry.

51:37.076 --> 51:39.042
How many guys were there
that night?

51:39.044 --> 51:40.280
I don't remember.

51:43.616 --> 51:45.817
I just remember getting there,

51:45.819 --> 51:47.685
and then waking up
in Isabelle's car.

51:47.687 --> 51:50.190
That's all I remember,
I swear.

51:56.363 --> 51:58.332
I guess that explains
the STD test.

52:01.835 --> 52:03.234
Here's the thing, Bob,

52:03.236 --> 52:05.902
you do have rights when
a club claims to be private,

52:05.904 --> 52:09.339
but you have to prove who's
responsible for leaking the names.

52:09.341 --> 52:11.808
You're kidding.
I have to prove it?

52:11.810 --> 52:13.176
What am I,
Sherlock Holmes?

52:13.178 --> 52:16.013
Well, kinda, unless evidence
falls from the sky,

52:16.015 --> 52:20.350
you have basically no
legal recourse whatsoever.

52:20.352 --> 52:22.053
Well, then I guess it's
gonna be a piece of cake

52:22.055 --> 52:24.721
you helping me with
what I need now.

52:24.723 --> 52:25.922
I want a trial separation.

52:25.924 --> 52:28.091
Oh, no,
that's a bad idea.

52:28.093 --> 52:29.661
Once you get to that point,

52:29.663 --> 52:32.163
it almost always leads
to divorce.

52:32.165 --> 52:34.966
And as your lawyer,
and as your best friend,

52:34.968 --> 52:36.299
I don't think you want that.

52:36.301 --> 52:40.705
I can't be in
the same house with her, Ben.

52:40.707 --> 52:42.272
Not while this is going on.

52:42.274 --> 52:43.741
I need to get out.

52:43.743 --> 52:45.743
All right.

52:45.745 --> 52:47.277
If you really decide
to go through with it,

52:47.279 --> 52:50.781
I have a small place
you can rent in town.

52:50.783 --> 52:53.283
It's been vacant a few months.

52:53.285 --> 52:55.353
I was actually
about to place an ad.

52:55.355 --> 52:57.321
Well, don't.

52:57.323 --> 52:58.388
I'll take it.

52:58.390 --> 53:00.093
Okay.

53:01.093 --> 53:02.960
Thanks, Ben.

53:02.962 --> 53:06.063
So,
as you can see,

53:06.065 --> 53:07.699
I have no other choice.

53:07.701 --> 53:10.033
Please. Someone is
trying to ruin me,

53:10.035 --> 53:12.002
my life, my career,
everything.

53:12.004 --> 53:13.471
I feel for you, I do,

53:13.473 --> 53:16.908
but my first priority
is the children.

53:16.910 --> 53:20.444
As is mine.
I love those kids.

53:20.446 --> 53:22.980
Please, I would never do
anything to hurt them.

53:22.982 --> 53:25.049
I am sorry, Morgan.

53:25.051 --> 53:26.317
Please,
just let me continue.

53:26.319 --> 53:28.118
I can't.
I can't.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.987
It's against policy.

53:30.989 --> 53:33.156
You need to leave.

53:33.158 --> 53:34.193
At least for now.

53:37.196 --> 53:38.765
I need your ID.

53:47.506 --> 53:48.908
I am sorry.

54:16.902 --> 54:18.435
We have to
sell the cars,

54:18.437 --> 54:20.837
we have to get rid of
the country club memberships,

54:20.839 --> 54:22.776
and we have to sell
the vacation home.

54:24.210 --> 54:25.245
Everything?

54:28.915 --> 54:31.915
Yeah, that's what happens
when you declare bankruptcy.

54:31.917 --> 54:33.120
Everything goes.

54:35.321 --> 54:37.855
And I'd keep my distance from
you little play pal there.

54:37.857 --> 54:40.290
I'm pretty sure that Isabelle
had something to do with this.

54:40.292 --> 54:42.460
No.

54:42.462 --> 54:44.362
Her name was
on the list, too.

54:44.364 --> 54:45.996
She's gonna lose
her business.

54:45.998 --> 54:47.397
She's suffering
just like we are.

54:47.399 --> 54:49.102
I doubt it.

54:52.437 --> 54:55.239
I'm sleeping
downstairs tonight.

54:55.241 --> 54:57.507
Babe, don't do that.

54:59.578 --> 55:01.281
Babe, please.

56:07.647 --> 56:10.882
<i>Hey, it's Abbey.
Leave a message.</i>

56:10.884 --> 56:12.350
Hey, Abbey, it's Dad.

56:12.352 --> 56:15.353
Would you please call me back
when you get this?

56:15.355 --> 56:17.087
Thank you.

56:29.201 --> 56:30.467
Dad called.

56:30.469 --> 56:34.006
He gave me the key
to his new place.

56:35.375 --> 56:39.379
Mom, I'm sorry.

56:41.413 --> 56:43.380
Honey, I'm sorry.

56:43.382 --> 56:45.085
None of this is your fault.

56:55.127 --> 56:58.395
I need your help
staging the house, okay?

56:58.397 --> 56:59.663
Okay.

56:59.665 --> 57:01.399
We have no idea
who did it.

57:01.401 --> 57:03.433
Yeah, well, somebody from
this club uploaded that list.

57:03.435 --> 57:06.103
A disgruntled employee.

57:06.105 --> 57:08.406
A drunk customer.
Somebody's ex.

57:08.408 --> 57:11.275
Look, buddy, I've lost 30
percent of my clientele already.

57:11.277 --> 57:12.643
They're asking me
for refunds.

57:12.645 --> 57:14.245
I've got a truck load of
lawsuits coming at me.

57:14.247 --> 57:15.612
Can you blame them?

57:15.614 --> 57:18.949
The list was supposed to be
confidential.

57:18.951 --> 57:20.317
Are you listening to
anything I'm saying?

57:20.319 --> 57:22.152
I'm losing my shirt here.

57:22.154 --> 57:25.091
If I knew who it was,
I'd be singing like Aretha Franklin!

57:26.993 --> 57:29.025
Well, you have to have
some sort of idea.

57:31.230 --> 57:33.297
Look, you look like
a smart guy.

57:33.299 --> 57:35.369
You think you could
fix this mess?

57:36.502 --> 57:37.734
I just might be able to.

57:40.105 --> 57:42.573
- Hey.
- Hi.

57:42.575 --> 57:43.975
I just wanted to
check on you.

57:43.977 --> 57:45.509
I left you
a couple of messages,

57:45.511 --> 57:46.978
and I haven't heard back so...

57:46.980 --> 57:48.279
Please, come in.

57:48.281 --> 57:49.315
Thanks.

57:51.250 --> 57:52.449
I didn't have my phone
on me all day

57:52.451 --> 57:54.185
because we had
an open house today.

57:54.187 --> 57:56.520
Looks like we sold the house.

57:56.522 --> 57:57.658
Wow.

57:58.591 --> 58:00.127
- Hey.
- Hey!

58:01.694 --> 58:04.328
So, I'm about to make dinner.
You want to join us?

58:04.330 --> 58:06.364
Um, I... I'd love to.
Thank you.

58:06.366 --> 58:08.065
Okay, why don't you guys
hang out,

58:08.067 --> 58:09.333
and I'll let you know
when dinner's ready.

58:09.335 --> 58:10.701
Okay.

58:10.703 --> 58:12.536
She's going through
such a hard time.

58:12.538 --> 58:14.705
Thanks so much for
being there for her.

58:14.707 --> 58:17.507
Of course.

58:17.509 --> 58:20.046
Trust me,
it's my pleasure.

58:21.180 --> 58:23.250
He was such a sweet guy.

58:25.051 --> 58:26.683
Your boyfriend?

58:26.685 --> 58:29.252
Ex because,
you know...

58:29.254 --> 58:31.087
the video.

58:31.089 --> 58:33.690
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

58:33.692 --> 58:36.330
You'll find someone new,
I promise.

58:37.263 --> 58:39.129
I don't know.

58:39.131 --> 58:41.031
I'm not like you.

58:41.033 --> 58:43.500
You know, beautiful.

58:43.502 --> 58:45.205
Thank you, Abbey.

58:46.538 --> 58:48.607
But I didn't always
look like this.

58:51.810 --> 58:56.513
People used to call me
fat and ugly and...

58:56.515 --> 58:59.549
it got so bad
that I, um...

58:59.551 --> 59:02.386
thought about
killing myself.

59:02.388 --> 59:03.654
My gosh.

59:03.656 --> 59:06.524
But...

59:06.526 --> 59:10.527
then I met someone
and things turned around.

59:10.529 --> 59:12.763
So I promise you...

59:12.765 --> 59:15.366
you'll meet someone new.

59:15.368 --> 59:16.636
I mean,
you're beautiful.

59:18.404 --> 59:20.370
Yes, you are.

59:20.372 --> 59:22.605
You just don't realize it.

59:22.607 --> 59:26.509
Look, it just so happens
that I have

59:26.511 --> 59:29.413
my fantastic
bag of tricks.

59:29.415 --> 59:31.649
How about I show you?

59:31.651 --> 59:33.451
Come on.

59:45.297 --> 59:47.765
How's it going, ladies?

59:47.767 --> 59:49.632
We'll be right down.

59:49.634 --> 59:51.470
Okay,
dinner's being served.

59:54.107 --> 59:56.777
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
we're almost there.

59:58.444 --> 59:59.676
Okay.

59:59.678 --> 01:00:01.312
All right.

01:00:01.314 --> 01:00:02.582
You can turn around.

01:00:04.817 --> 01:00:06.219
Wow.

01:00:08.453 --> 01:00:11.522
Now every boy will be lining
up to talk to you at school.

01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:13.190
Thank you.

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:15.592
Totally welcome.

01:00:15.594 --> 01:00:16.830
Okay, now let me finish.

01:00:21.134 --> 01:00:22.732
Can I tell you a secret?

01:00:22.734 --> 01:00:25.469
Of course.

01:00:25.471 --> 01:00:27.407
I've never been to
a club before.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.609
My mom won't let me go.

01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:33.409
You're kidding me,
right?

01:00:33.411 --> 01:00:34.777
No.

01:00:34.779 --> 01:00:36.547
I'm one of those nerds.

01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:39.783
You know, straight A's,
don't smoke, don't drink,

01:00:39.785 --> 01:00:41.618
still a virgin.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.689
My mom's really big
on abstinence.

01:00:45.591 --> 01:00:48.324
Or was.

01:00:48.326 --> 01:00:52.228
Look, those are all
really great things.

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:54.230
But sometimes a girl's
just gotta dance, right?

01:00:59.672 --> 01:01:02.142
Do you think anyone would
want to dance with me?

01:01:05.911 --> 01:01:07.547
Absolutely.

01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:10.716
Mom.

01:01:19.524 --> 01:01:20.824
What do you think?

01:01:20.826 --> 01:01:21.859
Isabelle did it.

01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:23.661
Isn't she pretty?

01:01:23.663 --> 01:01:25.862
Is this some kind of
a joke, Isabelle?

01:01:25.864 --> 01:01:28.498
No, we just thought that,
you know...

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.766
Mom, we thought that
the three of us

01:01:29.768 --> 01:01:31.868
could go out
after dinner and...

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:34.638
and it would be like
a new life sort of thing.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.373
Why don't you like it?

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:39.409
You're too young to be
dressed like this, Abbey.

01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:40.944
You have no idea
what's going on.

01:01:40.946 --> 01:01:43.813
Okay, I was just trying to
get her to express herself.

01:01:43.815 --> 01:01:45.748
Oh, so now you're criticizing
the way I raise my daughter?

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.283
Mom!

01:01:47.285 --> 01:01:48.551
Okay, you know what?
It's all right.

01:01:48.553 --> 01:01:49.953
We'll do it
another night. Okay?

01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:51.355
I should probably go.

01:01:51.357 --> 01:01:52.589
Yeah, you should.

01:01:52.591 --> 01:01:53.924
And there isn't gonna be
another night.

01:01:53.926 --> 01:01:55.993
Gosh, Mom, you never
let me do anything!

01:01:55.995 --> 01:01:58.828
Go upstairs, wash your face,
put your pajamas on.

01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:00.700
And what if I don't?!

01:02:02.935 --> 01:02:05.572
Abbey! Not tonight!

01:02:47.946 --> 01:02:49.612
I know that she's
going through a hard time,

01:02:49.614 --> 01:02:50.913
but she doesn't have to

01:02:50.915 --> 01:02:52.716
treat me like
I'm five years old.

01:02:52.718 --> 01:02:55.486
Abbey,
your mom loves you.

01:02:55.488 --> 01:02:56.853
Really?

01:02:56.855 --> 01:02:58.959
She's got a pretty
messed up way of showing it.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.426
Did your mom
treat you like this?

01:03:03.428 --> 01:03:05.596
I don't know my mom.

01:03:05.598 --> 01:03:07.998
Never met my dad.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.500
I was a foster kid.

01:03:09.502 --> 01:03:11.969
Oh...

01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:13.974
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

01:03:16.808 --> 01:03:18.509
You have no idea
how lucky you are

01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:20.680
that you have parents
who love you.

01:03:21.946 --> 01:03:24.517
You're right.
I know you're right.

01:03:26.785 --> 01:03:29.588
I don't love her,
I do not want her.

01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:32.823
Okay. My turn.

01:03:32.825 --> 01:03:33.857
Can I tell you a secret?

01:03:33.859 --> 01:03:35.625
Of course.

01:03:35.627 --> 01:03:39.698
I would trade places with you
in a heartbeat.

01:03:42.368 --> 01:03:44.967
Okay, enough about that.

01:03:44.969 --> 01:03:46.969
Let's go party.

01:03:46.971 --> 01:03:48.672
Wooo!

01:03:48.674 --> 01:03:51.375
Woo-woo!

01:03:58.884 --> 01:04:00.116
How old are you?

01:04:00.118 --> 01:04:03.353
Oh, honey, she's fine.

01:04:03.355 --> 01:04:05.455
Here's her ID.

01:04:15.567 --> 01:04:18.768
Ladies. Welcome to
Club Secret Sins.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:20.172
Thank you.

01:04:24.442 --> 01:04:26.710
You aren't a cop and you
don't have a search warrant.

01:04:26.712 --> 01:04:29.446
You don't even know
who you're looking for.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:31.515
So you found an address
on the web. So what?

01:04:31.517 --> 01:04:32.850
The dark web.

01:04:32.852 --> 01:04:34.585
And I traced the upload
back to here.

01:04:34.587 --> 01:04:36.819
This is definitely
the place where someone...

01:04:36.821 --> 01:04:39.790
they uploaded the videos
and the list that...

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:41.591
The membership list
to the adult club.

01:04:41.593 --> 01:04:43.926
- Yeah.
- Who cares?

01:04:43.928 --> 01:04:45.464
Can you help me or not?

01:04:46.931 --> 01:04:49.665
Why should I?
What's in it for me?

01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:51.868
Nothing.

01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:55.407
Just helping an innocent guy
get his life back.

01:04:58.676 --> 01:05:00.411
Come with me.

01:05:02.681 --> 01:05:04.114
All right, girl,
let's go dance.

01:05:04.116 --> 01:05:05.181
Come on.

01:05:05.183 --> 01:05:06.419
Come on.

01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:20.767
Relax.

01:05:38.951 --> 01:05:40.984
Abbey!

01:05:40.986 --> 01:05:42.685
Do you want to
get arrested?

01:05:42.687 --> 01:05:44.922
She's underage.

01:05:44.924 --> 01:05:46.056
Where's Isabelle?

01:05:46.058 --> 01:05:48.991
She... disappeared.

01:05:48.993 --> 01:05:50.028
Come on.

01:05:58.603 --> 01:06:00.837
See, I... I told you
this was a waste of my time.

01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:01.938
Stop.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.975
Watch her.

01:06:05.743 --> 01:06:06.779
That's her.

01:06:10.149 --> 01:06:11.817
Mister, you just saved
my marriage.

01:06:23.995 --> 01:06:26.496
I'm sorry.

01:06:26.498 --> 01:06:28.000
I should have listened.

01:06:30.102 --> 01:06:32.536
No.

01:06:32.538 --> 01:06:33.603
I'm sorry.

01:06:33.605 --> 01:06:35.973
I let you down.

01:06:35.975 --> 01:06:38.040
You grow up,
you have children,

01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:40.810
and you're supposed to
set an example.

01:06:40.812 --> 01:06:43.212
And then one day
you just blow it all

01:06:43.214 --> 01:06:45.781
by making a complete fool
out of yourself.

01:06:45.783 --> 01:06:47.283
You're not a fool.

01:06:47.285 --> 01:06:49.054
But I was.

01:06:50.723 --> 01:06:53.589
And I still can't explain
how that happened.

01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:56.125
It's so not me.

01:06:56.127 --> 01:06:58.194
It'll never happen again.

01:06:58.196 --> 01:06:59.228
Ever.

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:00.964
But you promise me that

01:07:00.966 --> 01:07:03.833
you will not go clubbing
with Isabelle again.

01:07:03.835 --> 01:07:05.736
Don't worry.

01:07:05.738 --> 01:07:09.071
Besides, something's strange
about Isabelle.

01:07:09.073 --> 01:07:10.873
What do you mean, strange?

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:14.011
Well, she tried to kiss me.

01:07:14.013 --> 01:07:15.045
She what?!

01:07:15.047 --> 01:07:16.913
Mom, let it go.

01:07:16.915 --> 01:07:19.583
It was what she said
that really bothered me.

01:07:19.585 --> 01:07:20.984
Tell me.

01:07:20.986 --> 01:07:25.321
She said that people
used to call her fat...

01:07:25.323 --> 01:07:26.957
and ugly.

01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:28.227
What?

01:07:29.761 --> 01:07:33.163
She thought that no one
was ever gonna love her.

01:07:33.165 --> 01:07:34.868
She wanted to kill herself.

01:07:36.167 --> 01:07:37.634
That's impossible.

01:07:37.636 --> 01:07:40.703
And then,
on the way to the club...

01:07:40.705 --> 01:07:44.209
I would trade places with you
in a heartbeat.

01:07:47.812 --> 01:07:50.013
Doesn't that, like,
freak you out?

01:07:50.015 --> 01:07:53.750
She's this hot, single babe,
and I'm this 17 year old nerd.

01:07:53.752 --> 01:07:55.721
Why would she want to
trade places with me?

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.263
Robert, I can't talk,
I'm... I'm...

01:08:06.265 --> 01:08:08.966
I know it was you that uploaded
the membership list and video.

01:08:08.968 --> 01:08:10.801
<i>Why? For money?</i>

01:08:10.803 --> 01:08:12.935
And what the hell's
wrong with you?

01:08:12.937 --> 01:08:16.372
Can we just get together
and talk about this calmly?

01:08:16.375 --> 01:08:18.578
You can talk to me or
you'll talk to my lawyer.

01:08:19.912 --> 01:08:23.645
Robert, look, you,
Morgan and I,

01:08:23.648 --> 01:08:25.381
we shared something special.

01:08:25.384 --> 01:08:26.917
What's your point?

01:08:26.919 --> 01:08:29.285
Just meet me in person.

01:08:29.287 --> 01:08:30.589
Okay? Let me explain.

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:33.689
Meet me at my place,
30 minutes.

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:35.595
Fifth and Riviera.

01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:41.798
We'll finish cleaning
in the morning.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.734
I'm gonna go see Daddy.

01:08:43.736 --> 01:08:46.203
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.837
I'm sure.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.705
You guys have got to
get back together.

01:08:54.013 --> 01:08:56.312
I had a client with
very deep pockets.

01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:58.015
I don't now.

01:08:58.017 --> 01:08:59.652
What's your explanation?

01:09:01.854 --> 01:09:03.953
That deal...

01:09:03.956 --> 01:09:05.421
would have saved my company,

01:09:05.424 --> 01:09:08.290
would have save my family,
and saved my home.

01:09:08.292 --> 01:09:10.426
And because of you,
I lost everything.

01:09:10.429 --> 01:09:11.794
I lost it all.

01:09:11.796 --> 01:09:13.362
You?

01:09:13.363 --> 01:09:15.999
I lost everything.

01:09:16.001 --> 01:09:17.033
I love you.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:21.037
Both of you,
you and Morgan.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.240
We could have had
the perfect life.

01:09:24.242 --> 01:09:25.841
Just the three of us.

01:09:25.844 --> 01:09:27.444
Mm.

01:09:27.446 --> 01:09:30.846
And Morgan is
the only woman for me.

01:09:30.849 --> 01:09:34.116
You, you were something
that we used one time

01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:35.285
for a little bit of fun.

01:09:35.287 --> 01:09:36.886
You mean nothing to us.

01:09:36.889 --> 01:09:38.888
No.

01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:41.457
No, you love me.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.326
You do, you love me.

01:09:44.328 --> 01:09:48.029
Morgan said that
I was easy to love.

01:09:48.032 --> 01:09:51.067
She said I was...

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:52.334
perfect.

01:09:52.336 --> 01:09:53.772
You're perfect.

01:10:07.219 --> 01:10:08.855
Get out of my house.

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:14.958
I'm not going anywhere.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.058
Get some help.

01:10:22.201 --> 01:10:23.933
Ahh!

01:10:48.993 --> 01:10:50.063
Robert?

01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:57.433
Robert, it's me.
Come on.

01:10:57.435 --> 01:10:59.369
I want to talk to you.

01:11:14.819 --> 01:11:15.854
Robert?

01:11:19.825 --> 01:11:20.960
Oh, my God.

01:11:23.394 --> 01:11:25.027
Robert, baby,
what happened?

01:11:25.029 --> 01:11:26.933
Oh, my God.

01:11:32.336 --> 01:11:33.904
<i>9-1-1,
what's your emergency?</i>

01:11:33.906 --> 01:11:35.472
My husband.

01:11:35.474 --> 01:11:37.973
Please,
send an ambulance, please.

01:11:37.975 --> 01:11:39.342
<i>Tell me your location.</i>

01:11:39.344 --> 01:11:41.210
Fifth and Riviera.

01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:42.978
He's unconscious.
Please.

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:46.316
Baby. Baby, wake up.

01:11:46.318 --> 01:11:47.851
<i>Ma'am, hello?
Are you there?</i>

01:11:47.853 --> 01:11:48.951
Oh, my God.

01:11:48.953 --> 01:11:50.286
<i>What...
What happened?</i>

01:12:10.876 --> 01:12:13.442
Mrs. DeAngelo,
I'm Detective Erickson,

01:12:13.444 --> 01:12:15.378
this is my partner,
Detective Barber.

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.784
We'd, uh,
like a word with you.

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:21.951
Sure.

01:12:21.953 --> 01:12:23.288
I'll be right back,
okay?

01:12:26.457 --> 01:12:27.559
This is good.

01:12:31.462 --> 01:12:34.196
Morgan, why would your
husband call this woman,

01:12:34.198 --> 01:12:36.165
this friend of yours,
what's her name?

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:37.234
Isabelle.

01:12:37.236 --> 01:12:38.500
Isabelle.

01:12:38.502 --> 01:12:41.540
Why would he call
Isabelle tonight?

01:12:43.608 --> 01:12:46.243
I don't know why
he would call her.

01:12:46.245 --> 01:12:48.410
We've been separated
for a while.

01:12:48.412 --> 01:12:50.146
- A while?
- Hm.

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:52.552
What were doing before you
went to your husband's house?

01:12:56.087 --> 01:12:58.588
It's none of your business
what I was doing.

01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:03.026
Ma'am, I'm afraid it is
our business.

01:13:03.028 --> 01:13:05.494
Why was it that you
and your husband separated?

01:13:05.496 --> 01:13:08.030
Was it because of
Isabelle?

01:13:08.032 --> 01:13:10.033
Let me tell you something.

01:13:10.035 --> 01:13:12.067
My husband and I were
high school sweethearts,

01:13:12.069 --> 01:13:13.168
and I love him.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.637
I would never hurt him.

01:13:14.639 --> 01:13:16.640
So if you think I put him
here in the hospital,

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:19.142
you're both sadly mistaken.

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:20.413
I'm calling my lawyer.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.179
Good day.

01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:26.548
As I said, gentlemen,

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:29.352
Robert was pursuing me
because...

01:13:29.354 --> 01:13:32.688
well, I satisfy him.

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:37.160
Apparently, something
his wife can't do.

01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:40.262
He fell in love with me.

01:13:40.264 --> 01:13:41.466
Most men do.

01:13:43.568 --> 01:13:45.168
And his wife...
Whoo.

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:49.138
She was incredibly angry
that he was still seeing me.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.573
I don't blame her.

01:13:50.575 --> 01:13:52.912
I mean, it wasn't
his first time.

01:13:53.979 --> 01:13:56.949
You see, Robert is
a sex addict.

01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:00.253
He just can't
control himself.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.554
I guess Morgan
just decided to...

01:14:05.556 --> 01:14:07.423
stop it.

01:14:07.425 --> 01:14:08.691
Once and for all.

01:14:08.693 --> 01:14:10.493
- Thank you.
- Mm.

01:14:10.495 --> 01:14:12.195
I'm sorry to have
bothered you.

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:15.365
We're concerned Mr. DeAngelo's
wife, Morgan,

01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:17.600
might have had something
to do with it.

01:14:17.602 --> 01:14:19.436
It's impossible.

01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:21.972
I mean, sure, they argued
like every married couple,

01:14:21.974 --> 01:14:24.341
but she's not
a violent person.

01:14:24.343 --> 01:14:25.575
Not in the least.

01:14:25.577 --> 01:14:28.414
So you did see them
arguing?

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:31.513
Well, once.

01:14:31.515 --> 01:14:34.252
Do you know exactly
what they were arguing about?

01:14:35.687 --> 01:14:37.587
I can't be
a hundred percent sure,

01:14:37.589 --> 01:14:40.693
but I think that she thought
he was having an affair.

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.128
Thanks.

01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:46.431
We appreciate your time.

01:14:53.638 --> 01:14:57.240
Hey, Sandy, I really don't
have time to talk right now.

01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:59.241
<i>Look, I am so sorry
to bother you.</i>

01:14:59.243 --> 01:15:01.444
I just got done
talking to the police.

01:15:01.446 --> 01:15:03.480
I think that they're
going to arrest you.

01:15:03.482 --> 01:15:06.048
What?!

01:15:23.035 --> 01:15:24.534
Mrs. DeAngelo?

01:15:24.536 --> 01:15:25.701
Metro P.D.

01:15:25.703 --> 01:15:27.072
Open the door, please.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.473
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

01:15:31.475 --> 01:15:33.679
Let's not make this more difficult
than it has to be, ma'am.

01:15:40.618 --> 01:15:43.552
- You take the back.
- Yeah. Good idea.

01:15:47.826 --> 01:15:49.528
Metro Police.

01:15:51.196 --> 01:15:52.398
Ma'am,
are you in here?

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.260
Metro Police.

01:16:26.564 --> 01:16:28.364
Miss DeAngelo!

01:16:28.366 --> 01:16:29.402
Are you home?

01:17:13.245 --> 01:17:14.310
Looks like
nobody's here.

01:17:14.312 --> 01:17:15.911
Looks that way.

01:17:15.913 --> 01:17:17.515
All right,
I'll call it in.

01:17:34.398 --> 01:17:35.565
<i>Police
are on the look out tonight</i>

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.200
<i>for a Miami woman</i>

01:17:37.202 --> 01:17:39.201
<i>who was prominently featured
in a video</i>

01:17:39.203 --> 01:17:41.704
<i>already viewed millions
of times on social media.</i>

01:17:41.706 --> 01:17:43.806
<i>According to
Metro detectives,</i>

01:17:43.808 --> 01:17:46.642
<i>Mrs. DeAngelo attacked her
husband with a golf club</i>

01:17:46.644 --> 01:17:49.646
<i>after finding out he was
having an affair.</i>

01:17:49.648 --> 01:17:52.182
<i>Right now, he's in the
hospital in critical condition,</i>

01:17:52.184 --> 01:17:53.482
<i>but she's on the loose,</i>

01:17:53.484 --> 01:17:54.950
<i>and authorities
are telling us</i>

01:17:54.952 --> 01:17:56.319
<i>she could be well armed.</i>

01:17:56.321 --> 01:17:57.719
Knock-knock.

01:17:57.721 --> 01:17:59.422
<i>I'm Jen Herrera,
Channel 57 News.</i>

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:01.490
Abbey?

01:18:01.492 --> 01:18:02.592
Maybe.

01:18:02.594 --> 01:18:04.860
We need to ask you
a few questions.

01:18:04.862 --> 01:18:08.664
My mom said I'm not supposed to
speak without a lawyer present.

01:18:08.666 --> 01:18:10.635
It'll just be a minute.

01:18:12.269 --> 01:18:14.439
You have 59 seconds.

01:18:17.809 --> 01:18:19.241
You do understand that

01:18:19.243 --> 01:18:20.910
your mother is
the primary suspect.

01:18:20.912 --> 01:18:23.612
No. Wrong.

01:18:23.614 --> 01:18:25.981
My mother would never
do something like this.

01:18:34.225 --> 01:18:37.860
We're not saying
your mom is a bad person,

01:18:37.862 --> 01:18:39.861
but sometimes good people
make mistakes.

01:18:39.863 --> 01:18:42.332
Don't you agree?

01:18:42.334 --> 01:18:44.700
Now you're giving me
a morality lesson?

01:18:44.702 --> 01:18:45.968
Forget this.

01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:47.971
Wait. Has your mother
tried to contact you?

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.405
- No.
- If she does,

01:18:49.407 --> 01:18:50.740
you need to contact us
immediately.

01:18:50.742 --> 01:18:52.808
- Abbey.
- Abbey.

01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:54.244
Your mom is in
deep trouble.

01:18:54.246 --> 01:18:55.410
Now, you may not
believe this,

01:18:55.412 --> 01:18:57.713
but we are
trying to help her.

01:18:57.715 --> 01:19:00.749
Abbey, she needs to come
forward and make a statement.

01:19:00.751 --> 01:19:02.951
The longer she's out there
avoiding the inevitable,

01:19:02.953 --> 01:19:05.424
the worse her case looks
in the eyes of the court.

01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:20.570
We'll have one of our men,
Officer Marquez,

01:19:20.572 --> 01:19:22.304
stationed right outside
your father's room

01:19:22.306 --> 01:19:24.374
until we catch
whoever did this.

01:19:24.376 --> 01:19:26.909
Oh. So he's
supposed to, like,

01:19:26.911 --> 01:19:29.646
stop my mom from
murdering my dad.

01:19:29.648 --> 01:19:31.446
Abbey, it's just
a precaution.

01:19:31.448 --> 01:19:34.950
Why are you people
ganging up on my mom?

01:19:34.952 --> 01:19:37.352
You should be out there
trying to find out

01:19:37.354 --> 01:19:39.056
who actually did this!

01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.468
Isabelle?

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:53.735
Hey, Abbey.

01:19:53.737 --> 01:19:55.405
What are you
doing here?

01:19:55.407 --> 01:19:57.005
Oh, I...

01:19:57.007 --> 01:19:58.307
brought you cookies.

01:19:58.309 --> 01:19:59.544
I made them myself.

01:20:01.578 --> 01:20:03.045
How's he doing?

01:20:03.047 --> 01:20:04.550
How does it look like
he's doing?

01:20:06.518 --> 01:20:07.953
Sorry.

01:20:09.754 --> 01:20:10.986
Not good.

01:20:10.988 --> 01:20:13.021
Doctor's aren't
quite sure yet.

01:20:13.023 --> 01:20:14.757
You know, when I saw
what happened on the news,

01:20:14.759 --> 01:20:17.660
I just couldn't believe it.

01:20:17.662 --> 01:20:18.794
Had to come visit him.

01:20:24.336 --> 01:20:25.371
Really?

01:20:28.706 --> 01:20:30.472
What were you doing
with the IV?

01:20:30.474 --> 01:20:32.408
Oh...

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:34.076
I was just making sure
it was working okay.

01:20:34.078 --> 01:20:36.478
Look, I... I know
he needs some rest,

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.347
so I'm gonna go.

01:20:38.349 --> 01:20:40.016
Enjoy the cookies.
Okay?

01:20:44.355 --> 01:20:45.588
So stupid.

01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:46.959
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:57.770
Come on, Dad.

01:21:04.376 --> 01:21:06.042
Hi. Excuse me.

01:21:06.044 --> 01:21:08.110
My cell phone's dead.

01:21:08.112 --> 01:21:10.847
<i>...DeAngelo attacked her
husband with a golf club...</i>

01:21:10.849 --> 01:21:13.652
Can I borrow yours
for a second, please?

01:21:15.019 --> 01:21:16.522
I have to call my daughter.

01:21:18.622 --> 01:21:19.856
Okay.

01:21:19.858 --> 01:21:22.057
Thank you.
I'll be right back.

01:21:22.059 --> 01:21:23.392
<i>...Channel 57 News.</i>

01:21:33.804 --> 01:21:34.936
Hello?

01:21:34.938 --> 01:21:36.938
Honey. Hi, it's Mom.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.708
I had to call you from
someone else's phone

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:39.776
in case they're tracing mine.

01:21:39.778 --> 01:21:40.810
Are you okay?

01:21:40.812 --> 01:21:43.015
Uh, hi, Grandma.

01:21:45.183 --> 01:21:46.982
It's nice to hear your voice.

01:21:46.984 --> 01:21:48.683
Why are you calling me...

01:21:48.685 --> 01:21:50.052
Where are you?

01:21:50.054 --> 01:21:53.890
I'm at the hospital,
Grandma, with Dad.

01:21:53.892 --> 01:21:56.025
There's a nice officer
outside our door

01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:57.759
making sure we're safe.

01:21:57.761 --> 01:21:59.529
Got it.

01:21:59.531 --> 01:22:02.899
I know, I saw Mom
on the TV too, Grandma.

01:22:02.901 --> 01:22:04.633
It's a total nightmare.

01:22:04.635 --> 01:22:06.134
How are you holding up?

01:22:06.136 --> 01:22:07.869
I'm okay. I need you
to do me a favor, please.

01:22:07.871 --> 01:22:09.571
Can you go to
your father's house

01:22:09.573 --> 01:22:11.574
and check his computer,
his calendar, everything.

01:22:11.576 --> 01:22:14.110
<i>I need to know what he was
doing before he was attacked.</i>

01:22:14.112 --> 01:22:16.512
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary, Grandma.

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:19.548
Hello?
Come on, already.

01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:21.517
I'll be right out.

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:22.584
Why?

01:22:22.586 --> 01:22:24.954
Isabelle stopped by.

01:22:24.956 --> 01:22:26.588
She brought
a plate of cookies.

01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:28.924
Why would Isabelle
bring a plate of cookies?

01:22:28.926 --> 01:22:31.694
And they're delicious.

01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:34.797
I think you should stop by
her house to get the recipe.

01:22:34.799 --> 01:22:37.165
<i>She'd be so surprised
to see you.</i>

01:22:37.167 --> 01:22:38.601
Got it.

01:22:38.603 --> 01:22:40.770
Okay.
I'll call you later.

01:22:40.772 --> 01:22:41.870
Love you.

01:22:41.872 --> 01:22:43.174
Hello?

01:22:48.246 --> 01:22:49.614
Is everything okay?

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.153
Chocolate chip?

01:22:57.221 --> 01:22:59.021
I lost one of my earrings.

01:22:59.023 --> 01:23:01.624
Is it okay if I go upstairs
to see if it's up there?

01:23:01.626 --> 01:23:03.092
Babe, I went there to get
a lost credit card,

01:23:03.094 --> 01:23:04.994
and those girls
jumped me, okay?

01:23:04.996 --> 01:23:06.795
<i>You know the kind of thing
that happens at that place.</i>

01:23:06.797 --> 01:23:08.931
Give him a taste of
his own medicine.

01:23:08.933 --> 01:23:11.133
Okay, just one.

01:23:11.135 --> 01:23:13.636
<i>It's like I was drugged
or something.</i>

01:23:13.638 --> 01:23:14.704
<i>And I'd keep my distance</i>

01:23:14.706 --> 01:23:16.505
from your little
play pal there.

01:23:16.507 --> 01:23:18.274
I'm pretty sure that Isabelle
had something to do with this.

01:23:18.276 --> 01:23:21.811
It was what she said
that really bothered me.

01:23:21.813 --> 01:23:25.548
I would trade places with you
in a heartbeat.

01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:28.620
You're not messing with
my family anymore.

01:23:29.787 --> 01:23:31.553
Yeah, I need a flight.

01:23:31.555 --> 01:23:32.590
Tonight.

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:38.026
Cancun, Mexico City.
Doesn't matter.

01:23:38.028 --> 01:23:39.564
Oh, I need
a hotel room, too.

01:23:43.033 --> 01:23:44.700
Indefinitely.

01:23:44.702 --> 01:23:46.569
What do you mean
I need a return date?

01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:47.837
I said indefinitely.

01:23:49.206 --> 01:23:51.207
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

01:23:51.209 --> 01:23:52.807
Isabelle.

01:23:52.809 --> 01:23:54.912
Help me.
They're after me.

01:24:07.024 --> 01:24:08.227
I had to see you.

01:24:10.562 --> 01:24:11.927
They think I did it.

01:24:11.929 --> 01:24:13.731
They think I killed Robert.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.668
I know,
it's all over the news.

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:21.006
The thing is... I did.

01:24:22.206 --> 01:24:25.141
I did try to kill him.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:26.875
Because...

01:24:26.877 --> 01:24:29.044
he stopped loving me.

01:24:29.046 --> 01:24:31.313
No. No, he didn't.

01:24:31.315 --> 01:24:33.149
So I came by to
say goodbye.

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.317
Goodbye?
Wh... Where are you going?

01:24:35.319 --> 01:24:37.919
Who cares.
The beach, the woods.

01:24:37.921 --> 01:24:40.255
Anywhere where I can
kill myself.

01:24:40.257 --> 01:24:41.856
No!

01:24:41.858 --> 01:24:43.892
Robert loves you.

01:24:43.894 --> 01:24:45.994
He told me.

01:24:45.996 --> 01:24:48.597
He said that you were
the only woman for him.

01:24:48.599 --> 01:24:50.266
He said those words?

01:24:50.268 --> 01:24:51.366
Yeah.

01:24:51.368 --> 01:24:52.802
When?

01:24:52.804 --> 01:24:55.306
When I went over to
his house to...

01:24:56.139 --> 01:24:57.973
Comfort him.

01:24:57.975 --> 01:25:00.910
He was so upset,
I just...

01:25:00.912 --> 01:25:02.611
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:02.613 --> 01:25:04.679
Because when I got there,

01:25:04.681 --> 01:25:07.083
he was already unconscious.

01:25:07.085 --> 01:25:09.855
Which must have been right
after you tried to kill him.

01:25:11.822 --> 01:25:13.054
Look, I don't know
what happened, okay?

01:25:13.056 --> 01:25:14.723
I just...
I freaked out.

01:25:14.725 --> 01:25:16.057
I didn't mean to hurt him,
it just...

01:25:16.059 --> 01:25:17.094
it just happened.

01:25:19.964 --> 01:25:21.800
Going somewhere?

01:25:24.335 --> 01:25:26.102
I'm gonna leave.

01:25:26.104 --> 01:25:27.770
And you're not going to
call the cops,

01:25:27.772 --> 01:25:29.771
because if you do,

01:25:29.773 --> 01:25:32.842
I'm gonna tell them you came
over here to kill me, too.

01:25:32.844 --> 01:25:35.113
And they're gonna believe me
before they believe you.

01:25:37.114 --> 01:25:39.414
Really, bitch?
I don't think so.

01:25:39.416 --> 01:25:40.883
<i>I didn't mean to hurt him,
it just...</i>

01:25:40.885 --> 01:25:42.250
<i>it just happened.</i>

01:25:42.252 --> 01:25:44.352
That's you.

01:25:44.354 --> 01:25:46.088
I'm gonna share this
with the cops.

01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:49.325
And they're gonna send you
to a brand new private club.

01:25:49.327 --> 01:25:50.692
For many years.

01:25:50.694 --> 01:25:53.195
Hm? Gotcha.

01:25:58.236 --> 01:25:59.938
Ahh!

01:26:24.228 --> 01:26:26.896
You ruined it!

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:41.110
What you need...

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:43.044
is a little stretch.

01:26:47.818 --> 01:26:49.985
<i>9-1-1,
please state your emergency.</i>

01:26:49.987 --> 01:26:51.920
This is Morgan DeAngelo.

01:26:51.922 --> 01:26:54.723
I think you're
looking for me.

01:27:00.331 --> 01:27:02.364
So you're married?

01:27:02.366 --> 01:27:03.798
Yes, miss, I am.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.133
Hm, that's nice.

01:27:05.135 --> 01:27:07.102
That's very nice.

01:27:15.345 --> 01:27:16.747
I'm so sorry.

01:28:06.429 --> 01:28:08.798
So, what do you think?

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.100
As long as I have you,
I love it.

01:28:14.371 --> 01:28:17.071
I don't need any more
excitement in my life.

01:28:17.073 --> 01:28:18.809
Me, either.

01:28:22.913 --> 01:28:24.116
Let's take a picture.

01:28:25.349 --> 01:28:27.219
- Okay.
- First day in our new home.

01:29:01.788 --> 01:29:06.788
