WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.537
[dramatic music]

00:03.571 --> 00:06.174
- Tonight, "Forged in Fire"
is going bigger...

00:06.207 --> 00:08.509
*

00:08.542 --> 00:11.312
As in global.
- Poland, go fight.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.481
And I will fight.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.650
- Four of the best bladesmiths
from around the world--

00:16.684 --> 00:20.688
Argentina, France, Poland,
and the United States,

00:20.721 --> 00:24.758
going head-to-head...
- I plan on giving 110%

00:24.792 --> 00:26.694
to see that the USA wins this.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.762
- Smith against smith...
- Ah...

00:28.796 --> 00:32.733
- Country against country.
- I'm gonna win. [laughs]

00:32.766 --> 00:34.602
- With national pride
on the line,

00:34.635 --> 00:37.205
who will earn the right
to be crowned the first

00:37.238 --> 00:40.274
"Forged in Fire"
international champion?

00:40.308 --> 00:43.211
[dramatic music]

00:43.244 --> 00:48.649
*

00:48.682 --> 00:52.353
- My name is Michael Trollsky.
I'm from Poland and I'm 36.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.655
Everybody calls me
Trollsky because trolls

00:54.688 --> 00:56.824
are big, ugly creatures.

00:56.857 --> 01:00.094
It's universal nickname.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.163
I am very proud that
I can represent Poland,

01:02.196 --> 01:04.298
but there is a pressure.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.567
I am thinking about this,
but I will do my best.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.636
- My name is Julien Maniglier.

01:08.669 --> 01:12.406
I come from France
and I'm 43 years old.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.809
When I received the invitation
from "Forged in Fire,"

01:15.843 --> 01:18.246
I just couldn't believe it.

01:18.279 --> 01:22.150
[blows raspberries]
[stammers]

01:22.183 --> 01:23.384
It's amazing.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.520
So everything's possible.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.357
- I'm JW Randall,
I'm 58 years old,

01:29.390 --> 01:31.459
and I'm from
Keithville, Louisiana.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.727
I'm very competitive,
always have been.

01:33.761 --> 01:39.133
I plan on giving 110%
to make my country proud.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.734
We're gonna have fun,
but we're gonna go

01:40.768 --> 01:42.503
as hard as we can go.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.205
- Mi nombre  Guillermo Mendoza.

01:53.314 --> 01:57.285
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to our Forge.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.353
Today the four of you
will represent

01:59.387 --> 02:01.789
your respective countries:
Poland, France,

02:01.822 --> 02:04.292
the United States of America,
and Argentina,

02:04.325 --> 02:06.894
in a competition
for $10,000 U.S.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.529
and the title
of "Forged in Fire"

02:08.562 --> 02:10.631
international champion.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.767
You're about to experience
a competition in three rounds

02:13.801 --> 02:17.271
designed to test every aspect of
your bladesmithing capabilities.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.373
At the end of each round,
you will present your work

02:19.407 --> 02:22.410
to our panel of expert judges.
Let's meet them now.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.213
ABS Mastersmith J. Neilson,

02:25.246 --> 02:28.549
historic weapons recreation
specialist David Baker,

02:28.582 --> 02:32.553
and last, edged weapons
specialist Doug Marcaida.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.389
Perhaps you've noticed
on your anvils is a drop cloth.

02:35.423 --> 02:38.659
Feel free to lift that up.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.694
In the first round
of this competition,

02:40.728 --> 02:44.798
you will forge your blades
from a sphere of 52100 steel.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.634
Keep in mind that
in the second round,

02:46.667 --> 02:48.569
you'll be attaching handles
to those blades

02:48.602 --> 02:50.804
to turn them
into fully-functional weapons

02:50.838 --> 02:53.774
that will then be tested
for strength and durability

02:53.807 --> 02:56.610
in a log chop
and for edge retention,

02:56.644 --> 02:58.946
in an apple slice.

02:58.979 --> 03:02.416
We're going to give you four
hours to complete your work.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.918
Oh, wait,
there's one more thing.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.354
You may have noticed
that the Forge

03:06.387 --> 03:10.558
is conspicuously
absent of tongs.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.261
Instead,
we're gonna give you this.

03:15.929 --> 03:20.701
You may use the steel
from that bucket to forge tongs.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.672
- I've never forged tongs.
I don't know.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.474
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

03:26.507 --> 03:29.310
- Keep in mind that
when the clock hits zero

03:29.343 --> 03:31.312
and your blades
have been inspected,

03:31.345 --> 03:33.714
one of you will have
to surrender your work

03:33.747 --> 03:35.849
and leave the Forge.

03:35.883 --> 03:40.421
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your four hours starts now.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.323
[rock music]

03:42.356 --> 03:45.926
- Okay, guys.
- "Forged in Fire."

03:45.959 --> 03:48.896
- All right, good.
- How come we never do that?

03:48.929 --> 03:51.632
[clanging]

03:51.665 --> 03:53.267
- I feel shocked.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.002
I'm a bladesmith,
not a toolmaker,

03:55.035 --> 03:57.638
so I never made a pair of tongs.

03:59.473 --> 04:03.043
Because the challenge is to
chop wood and slice some apples,

04:03.076 --> 04:04.978
I will make a big chopper.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.316
Chopper is a kind of blade
that never failed me.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.950
[speaks Polish]
It means:

04:09.983 --> 04:12.820
"Poland, go fight"...
and I will fight.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.855
- All of this steel
is mild steel.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.791
This is just a matter of shaping
and piecing things together.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.827
- Low carbon,
you can beat on it cold.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.429
It doesn't matter.
- If they're smart,

04:21.462 --> 04:23.697
they'll make tongs
with long jaws,

04:23.731 --> 04:26.334
so as that ball bearing
gets thinned out,

04:26.367 --> 04:29.503
they can adjust the tongs
to match the thickness.

04:29.537 --> 04:33.441
*

04:33.474 --> 04:36.510
Guillermo is dropping the hammer
of the gods from the sky.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.380
- That whole anvil
is gonna get a headache.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.626
*

04:52.660 --> 04:55.896
- So I'm finishing
the tong because I need--

04:55.929 --> 04:58.499
it has to be round to catch it.

04:58.532 --> 05:02.703
It's really hard to catch,
so I need this.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.672
Look, there.

05:04.705 --> 05:09.343
Because of the test,
I'm leaning more towards

05:09.377 --> 05:10.811
a camp knife.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.415
[laughs]
Oh.

05:14.448 --> 05:18.752
I'm very proud to be
the first French person

05:18.786 --> 05:20.854
to pave the way for the others.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.124
Yeah.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.127
Ah, [bleep].

05:27.160 --> 05:30.531
I take my tong,
try to catch the ball,

05:30.564 --> 05:32.600
and it break.
Crap.

05:32.633 --> 05:36.103
- So Julien has to remake
another section of tongs,

05:36.136 --> 05:38.406
and his steel has just been
sitting in his forge.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.743
Too thin.
both: Yeah?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.144
- My plan is to get the ball
bearing in the forge

05:44.177 --> 05:46.046
as quickly as possible,

05:46.079 --> 05:47.848
and I'm gonna have to get
those tongs made to do it.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.783
*

05:49.817 --> 05:51.452
It's been a while
since I made some tongs.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.421
I mean, it's got to a be
big enough opening

05:53.454 --> 05:57.491
that it'll hold that ball.
That's the tricky part about it.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.527
I'm gonna design a camp knife

05:59.560 --> 06:01.529
and make it heavy enough
to chop wood

06:01.562 --> 06:04.898
and still thin enough
on the edge to slice the apples.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.834
I'm a little bit
behind on the tongs.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.836
Other than that, everything's
going according to plan.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.604
*

06:10.638 --> 06:12.806
- Bladesmith,
one hour has elapsed.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.976
You have three hours remaining
to finish your work.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.646
- Hey, Guillermo.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.680
[kisses]

06:24.084 --> 06:25.853
- Guillermo
has completed his tongs.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.054
- He could probably make tongs
for everybody

06:27.087 --> 06:28.188
and not sweat it too much.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.490
*

06:36.597 --> 06:40.768
- Nice.
[groans]

06:40.801 --> 06:43.837
- Yours are beautiful.
Mine are ugly as I am.

06:43.871 --> 06:47.641
- [laughs]
So now my tongs are done.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.811
I love it.
My ball is hot.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.980
Go to Big Blue.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.716
When I start to hit
with the hammer,

06:55.749 --> 06:58.085
I can't hold it with my tongs.

06:58.118 --> 07:01.121
It's moving in all direction.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.857
That's the first
real frustration.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.726
*

07:07.528 --> 07:09.763
There is no time
for experimenting here.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.600
That is why I use
only press today.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.835
You want the press?
- Yeah.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.505
- Please, sir.
I know Julien from today,

07:17.538 --> 07:19.840
but I feel like
I know him for ten years.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.241
I come after you.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.543
- Okay.
- There is cooperating

07:22.576 --> 07:24.478
and not competing.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.680
Don't turn it off.
- Okay.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.116
- No pressure of competition,
just friendship.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.984
- Tell me when you're ready.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.053
- Ready.
- Okay.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.790
- This is the only competition
that I'm aware of

07:36.824 --> 07:39.860
that not only do
the contestants get along,

07:39.893 --> 07:41.995
but they're always helping
each other out, too.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.498
- [laughs]
You got a round there.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.966
- Blech.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.636
*

07:48.669 --> 07:51.071
- [bleep].
The tongs are taking me a while,

07:51.104 --> 07:52.906
and I'm struggling with it.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.209
I came up with cutting
a notch into the tongs

07:56.243 --> 07:58.245
so that I could hold the bar
with some leverage.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.548
That's the whole problem,
just containing it.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.050
*

08:03.083 --> 08:04.885
I want that steel to heat up,

08:04.918 --> 08:07.588
and it's not being
my friend at all.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.990
It's not getting hot
fast enough.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.826
- It's got to be making
JW sweat knowing that

08:12.860 --> 08:15.529
everybody else has had
their steel in the fire.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.698
His tongs aren't working out
the way he was hoping.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.800
Now he's just got to stand there
and wait for that steel to heat.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.702
It's got to drive you crazy.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.171
- How are things?
- Uh, rough.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.674
- We are running out of time.
- Yeah.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.176
*

08:29.209 --> 08:30.878
- I don't think Guillermo's
broken a sweat yet.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.012
- Why would he?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.290
- Is Guillermo using
a small hammer,

08:43.323 --> 08:45.158
or is he just a big man?

08:45.192 --> 08:48.195
- Uh, both.
- [laughs]

08:54.301 --> 08:57.204
Oh, la la.
- What is wrong?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.139
*

08:59.172 --> 09:01.274
- I think it's a crack.
- Take it to the grinder.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.110
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

09:03.143 --> 09:06.013
- Hearing that?
- I heard something about grind.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.116
There's something that Julien's
hoping he can grind out.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.084
*

09:11.118 --> 09:12.786
- It's a crack.
- It's a crack?

09:12.820 --> 09:17.658
- Look.
- [bleep].

09:17.691 --> 09:19.126
- I think he's got a crack
in that steel.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.168
So I grind and grind and grind,

09:28.201 --> 09:32.873
and I flip it over...
[groans, laughs]

09:32.906 --> 09:36.276
The crack's superficial.
It is gone.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.214
- High five.
- Yeah, man.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.717
- Okay, so round one of our
first international competition.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.653
How these guys looking?

09:45.686 --> 09:46.620
- I'd like to see Michael
get back in this game.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.155
- Yeah.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.824
- I constantly
have to fix my tongs.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.794
The quality of grip
is really, really low.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.128
*

09:55.162 --> 09:56.864
[groans]

09:56.897 --> 09:58.298
- I want to see Michael
just draw a knife

09:58.331 --> 10:00.901
profile on that big slab.
- He is. [laughs]

10:00.934 --> 10:02.770
- He is! Okay, there it is.
He is drawing it.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.771
[laughter]

10:03.804 --> 10:05.639
*

10:05.673 --> 10:08.976
- I decide to grind
the shape of my knife

10:09.009 --> 10:10.944
from a billet
instead of forging it.

10:10.978 --> 10:14.748
Yeah.
It's my competition now.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.117
You want to fight?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.352
*

10:19.386 --> 10:21.755
- I think JW's gonna go back
to Louisiana

10:21.789 --> 10:24.658
and kiss all of his tongs.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.259
- Tongs from hell.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.662
Every time I take the steel
out of the forge,

10:28.696 --> 10:30.363
I am slipping
and trying to re-grip.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.065
[bleep].

10:32.099 --> 10:33.967
I'm feeling a little bit behind.
I do.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.369
I make a decision
to leave my blade bevels

10:36.403 --> 10:39.072
a little thicker and grind.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.308
- Well, now that JW's
gotten away from those tongs,

10:41.341 --> 10:42.810
he's doing a lot better.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.745
- I'm absolutely gonna be doing

10:44.778 --> 10:47.748
everything I can to see
that the USA wins this.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.117
*

10:50.150 --> 10:51.418
- Guillermo is so
ahead of the game.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.420
Wow.
- And here's the question.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.188
Do you think
Guillermo's gonna quench early

10:55.222 --> 10:56.924
and then grind?
- Oh, that would be amazing.

10:56.957 --> 11:03.931
*

11:05.332 --> 11:07.234
I can see the warp from here.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.770
- Yeah, you can see a bow
in the middle of his blade.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.905
- That scares me.

11:11.939 --> 11:16.043
- So Guillermo lays his blade
on the cold anvil stand.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.045
Is that gonna pull the warp
that he's fighting?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.947
- It can.
Just like us, you know,

11:19.980 --> 11:21.414
we pull away from the heat.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.050
Steel actually does
the same thing.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.918
- [vocalizing]

11:24.952 --> 11:27.020
*

11:27.054 --> 11:29.890
- Julien's a bit of a showman.
- Yeah, it's a good show.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.458
- Yeah.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.894
- My blade is basically
finished.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.463
So put under the fire.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.867
When the edge is
at the right temperature,

11:39.900 --> 11:43.436
I'll do my quench.
It's now or never.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.106
Put it into the oil
and leave it into the oil.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.976
- So you are finished?
- My blade is cooling down.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.944
Where are you?

11:50.978 --> 11:52.279
It could bend.
It could break.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.448
Here you are.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.285
It could jump and run away.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.153
*

12:00.187 --> 12:01.454
That's good.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.226
Whoo-hoo.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.528
- So Michael
has yet to heat-treat,

12:08.561 --> 12:10.831
and JW has yet
to heat-treat.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.233
- If you screw
the heat treatment.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.336
You have a piece of junk
with a nice-looking handle.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.005
- We'll see what happens here.
- Put it in there.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.039
- It's very, very hot.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.843
*

12:22.876 --> 12:26.013
And it's in the quench.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.882
- All right,
moment of truth for Michael.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.851
- I have a little bending,
but if I reach

12:30.884 --> 12:34.487
the second phase, I will fix it.

12:34.521 --> 12:38.325
- You have just 15 minutes
remaining in this round.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.862
- 52100 steel
doesn't move fast.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.464
- Of course,
all eyes are on JW.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.034
- And I am
hogging the grinder.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.436
- All right,
that's enough, JW, Come on.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.005
*

12:52.039 --> 12:54.541
- Going for the edge quench.
- I'm fine with that.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.244
*

12:57.277 --> 12:59.512
- If JW develops a warp
in the quench,

12:59.546 --> 13:01.448
he won't have that
much time to correct it.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.084
- No, no, not at all.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.854
Nice, we got a quench.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.488
- This is kind of
a make-or- break moment

13:08.521 --> 13:10.490
for JW, right here.
- Yeah, it is.

13:10.523 --> 13:15.929
*

13:15.963 --> 13:17.364
That sucker is hard.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.233
- Nice job.
- Thank you, buddy.

13:20.267 --> 13:24.037
It was a fight.
- Ten, nine, eight,

13:24.071 --> 13:28.075
seven, six, five, four,

13:28.108 --> 13:31.344
three, two, one.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.246
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines, drop your tools.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.282
Return to your anvils.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.085
Round one of this international
competition is over.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.020
- Whoo-hoo!

13:40.053 --> 13:42.155
- I knew that I was behind,

13:42.189 --> 13:44.892
but I came to conquer,

13:44.925 --> 13:47.627
so I was forced
to paw and chew to the end.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.930
- I see Julien's blade.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.865
It looks really good,
like a pirate.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.533
Julien the pirate.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.302
*

13:55.335 --> 13:57.204
- Bladesmiths,
round one is complete,

13:57.237 --> 13:58.538
and now it's time
for the judges

13:58.571 --> 14:00.607
to take a closer
look at your work.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.375
Guillermo,
you're up first.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.544
Please present
your weapon to the judges.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.479
*

14:06.513 --> 14:08.315
- I really enjoyed
watching you forge.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.383
Your control was fantastic
and the power

14:10.417 --> 14:13.386
that you put into the strikes
and the accuracy.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.023
I think we need to rename
Big Blue Guillermo.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.590
- [laughs] Thank you.

14:17.624 --> 14:21.128
- You had a slight warp
in the blade

14:21.161 --> 14:22.963
that you were fighting.
It's right up here,

14:22.996 --> 14:25.398
but very nice,
very clean work.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.235
- Thank you so much.
- JW, you're up.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.337
Please present
your work to the judges.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.040
- JW, I really like this.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.075
Having issues
with the tongs in the beginning

14:35.108 --> 14:37.310
so it kind of
slowed you up a bit,

14:37.344 --> 14:40.547
but using the torch
to edge quench this

14:40.580 --> 14:43.984
so you get the hard edge
and the soft spine is fantastic.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.353
You do have
one spot right in here

14:46.386 --> 14:48.188
where you've got
a bit of a drop,

14:48.221 --> 14:49.589
but all in all,
very nicely done.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.959
- Thank you.
- Julien, please present

14:51.992 --> 14:54.194
your work to the judges.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.597
- First off, Julien,
you had so much fun out there.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.533
We know that people
who have fun do their best work.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.535
- Yeah.
- Nice design.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.039
I like that sweeping feel
for chopper and a slasher

15:06.073 --> 15:08.241
with your blade.
- My only concern is,

15:08.275 --> 15:11.478
there's so much weight here
and nothing back here.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.314
Yeah, I like to see a little bit
more here in the handle,

15:14.347 --> 15:16.683
but it's a pretty piece.
- Thank you.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.051
- Michael, you're up.

15:18.085 --> 15:22.322
*

15:22.355 --> 15:26.393
- This thing is a devastator.
Very nice setup for a handle.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.595
The microfractures--
but what I can't see,

15:28.628 --> 15:31.098
because the forge scale
is still here,

15:31.131 --> 15:32.632
how deep they go.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
They might be right
within the ability

15:34.667 --> 15:36.536
to just grin
that spine down

15:36.569 --> 15:39.306
and lose those,
but there's no way I can tell.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.441
- Thank you.
- All right, bladesmiths,

15:41.474 --> 15:43.710
the judges have to go
into deliberation,

15:43.743 --> 15:47.014
so I'll need you to step
off the Forge floor.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.215
*

15:48.248 --> 15:51.251
- [groans]

15:51.284 --> 15:52.986
Okay, judges,
we're gonna start with

15:53.020 --> 15:55.122
Guillermo's blade
on the end.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.025
- Guillermo did
a beautiful job on this.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.493
You know, it's light enough
that it's gonna be fast,

16:00.527 --> 16:02.362
but it's got enough
of a spine there

16:02.395 --> 16:03.763
that it should be plenty strong.

16:03.796 --> 16:08.101
- Guillermo Big Blue.
[laughter]

16:08.135 --> 16:09.736
- He was fighting
a bit of a warp

16:09.769 --> 16:11.538
during that heat treat,

16:11.571 --> 16:13.473
so it looks like
he got most of it out,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.442
but the rest could
actually be ground out.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.778
- All right, Doug, we're gonna
move on to JW's blade.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.114
- That's one of
the nicest camp knives

16:21.148 --> 16:22.715
I've seen over here.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.451
The fact that he did
an edge quench is awesome

16:24.484 --> 16:26.219
because that shows
that he understood

16:26.253 --> 16:28.021
to keep this soft
like a shock absorber

16:28.055 --> 16:29.589
for when we're doing the chop.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.558
- Your technique was
really nice to watch.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.226
- Thank you.
- Really.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.761
- I love how the colors define

16:34.794 --> 16:36.796
what's going on in this blade.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.299
You can see, that's your hard
edge taking that torch,

16:39.332 --> 16:41.734
so that stuff is hard as can be.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.471
Now you got the blue.
That's softer,

16:44.504 --> 16:47.474
but you get the third,
that purple color.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.309
That's what you look for,
the colors.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.611
- Okay, let's move on
to our next bladesmith, Julien.

16:51.644 --> 16:55.682
- [exhales sharply]
I'm stressed.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.152
- Julien gave us a very nice
competition cutter.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.154
He's got enough mass in here

17:01.188 --> 17:02.489
if he brings these grinds
all the way up.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.657
He's got fantastic
edge geometry.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.295
- Biggest concern, he's gotten
very thin here in the handle.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.297
I'm not sure how he's gonna
make this handle work

17:10.330 --> 17:12.699
with so much blade up front.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.568
- Let's move on to our last
bladesmith, Michael.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.605
- I like that design.
I wouldn't change a thing,

17:18.638 --> 17:21.708
but the biggest issue,
of course, are the cracks

17:21.741 --> 17:24.144
that we see right here
on the spine.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.379
When you chop into wood,
that could travel up to there

17:26.413 --> 17:29.482
and either open up the cracks
or possibly break the blade.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.518
- They are keeping
my knife for too long.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.487
- [laughs]

17:34.521 --> 17:37.224
- Honestly, if he cut
a 1/2 inch off the back

17:37.257 --> 17:39.592
of this thing
and made it into an actual seax,

17:39.626 --> 17:42.262
this would be a wicked piece.
- It's that time.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.396
Doug, have you made
your final decision?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.397
- Yes, I have.
- Dave?

17:44.431 --> 17:46.099
- Yep.
- J.?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.168
- Yeah.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.404
- Bladesmiths, forging weapons
is an art and science

17:51.438 --> 17:53.606
shared by all cultures
and peoples.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.808
This international competition
brought the world together

17:55.842 --> 17:57.444
in this forge.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.679
Dziekuje ci,
merci beaucoup,

17:59.712 --> 18:02.615
thank you very much,
and muchas gracias.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.517
- Bladesmiths,
it's that time.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.219
*

18:06.253 --> 18:08.588
The bladesmith leaving
the Forge is...

18:08.621 --> 18:10.457
*

18:10.490 --> 18:13.760
Michael, your blade
did not make the cut.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.663
David Baker will explain.
- Michael,

18:16.696 --> 18:18.531
you turned in a blade
that we all wanted

18:18.565 --> 18:21.168
to chop something with,
but we couldn't overlook

18:21.201 --> 18:22.869
that pronounced warp
in your blade

18:22.902 --> 18:25.372
and those fractures
along the back edge.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.574
For that,
we've got to let you go.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.576
- Michael,
please surrender your blade.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.711
*

18:31.744 --> 18:34.881
- Deeply in my heart
I feel disappointment.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.749
I came here
to represent Poland, so...

18:40.787 --> 18:43.590
What not kill you
will make you stronger.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.792
*

18:45.825 --> 18:47.827
- Bladesmiths, you've made it
to the second round.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.263
Poland is out,
and it's down to France,

18:50.297 --> 18:51.764
United States, and Argentina.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.733
Now that your blades
have been tempered,

18:53.766 --> 18:55.302
it's time to turn them
into fully-functional weapons

18:55.335 --> 18:57.304
by attaching handles to them

18:57.337 --> 18:59.772
using the range of materials
provided in our pantry.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.809
You will have three hours
to complete this challenge.

19:02.842 --> 19:07.747
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your three hours starts now.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.750
I think that Guillermo
and JW have by far

19:10.783 --> 19:12.319
the most developed blades,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.787
and Julien still needs
to work on his

19:14.821 --> 19:16.189
a little bit, correct?
- Yeah.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.565
[air hissing, pops]

19:25.598 --> 19:28.868
- The fact that he's trying
to go for perfection is amazing,

19:28.901 --> 19:30.903
'cause even that little bend
was--you know,

19:30.937 --> 19:32.605
it's not that critical.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.774
*

19:46.419 --> 19:48.755
*

19:48.788 --> 19:52.492
- You know what I really like
about Julien's blade?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.861
That came straight out
of his imagination.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.629
- It's got a character
to it too.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.265
- Right.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.866
- I start to shape my handle

19:59.899 --> 20:04.371
so that it's ergonomic
for the judges.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.440
- It's nice to see he's
re-profiling that finger notch.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.741
- Nice if it was
more subtle.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.310
*

20:10.343 --> 20:13.012
- I realize that actually

20:13.045 --> 20:16.749
the geometry of my blade
is a little too wide

20:16.783 --> 20:19.519
to be effective
on the apple slice.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.953
- It's like
he's steering a boat.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.923
- [humming]

20:23.956 --> 20:26.826
- So now it's getting
very technical.

20:26.859 --> 20:30.430
*

20:30.463 --> 20:32.332
- The right here side
of the ricasso

20:32.365 --> 20:34.701
was a little bit thick
where the transition

20:34.734 --> 20:37.437
from the tang
into the blade is.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.906
- JW's blade grinds
were beautiful.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.408
- I'd love to see him
just increase

20:41.441 --> 20:43.610
the distal taper
a little bit.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.045
- Next I'm working on
cleaning up the profile

20:46.078 --> 20:48.047
of the blade a little.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.517
Guillermo, this is tough.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.552
I feel like it's really
interesting to me

20:52.585 --> 20:55.755
that you can be
from different countries

20:55.788 --> 20:58.358
and bring everybody together,
and it's really cool

20:58.391 --> 21:00.393
when you don't even
understand the language,

21:00.427 --> 21:02.462
and you're still
sharing and improving.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.663
*

21:03.696 --> 21:04.764
- Guillermo's trying to drill

21:04.797 --> 21:06.999
through his tang right now.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.443
*

21:16.476 --> 21:18.478
- That drill bit,
once it hits the metal,

21:18.511 --> 21:19.946
you're gonna end up
with a dark ring around there,

21:19.979 --> 21:21.648
so not gonna be
as tight a fit.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.851
Now there's a hole made
into the surface,

21:24.884 --> 21:27.320
it's an easy place
for that fracture to begin.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.389
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.923
- Oh, this is the perfect time
for the end of that handle

21:30.957 --> 21:35.995
to snap.
- Oh, [bleep].

21:36.028 --> 21:37.330
- Guillermo's trying
to drill through

21:37.364 --> 21:38.931
the tang of his blade.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.667
- The bit was going up
into the chuck.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.470
- So Guillermo's not
making any headway.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.039
- Oh, is he just gonna
fill it with epoxy?

21:47.073 --> 21:49.075
- You do what you got to do,
I guess.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.544
- So Guillermo basically
has a false panel

21:51.578 --> 21:53.546
on one side of his blade.
- Yeah.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.048
- That's an inlay now
and no mechanical connection.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.358
- We've seen what happens
on a strength test

22:05.392 --> 22:07.894
when you've got air pockets
and a hidden tang.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.696
Those tend to fracture.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.398
*

22:11.431 --> 22:14.000
- We've got paracord
and paracord.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.868
- Yeah, buddy.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.004
- I know those are
your favorite, too, J.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.039
- Yeah, well,
there's not a lot of grinding

22:20.072 --> 22:23.476
and whatnot involved in that.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.044
- It's gonna be interesting.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.846
You think Julien will go
for a French braid?

22:26.879 --> 22:29.649
[laughter]

22:29.682 --> 22:33.886
- It's important to me to make
a handle out of paracord.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.855
It's something
I master very well.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.458
It is also
a part of my style.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.860
*

22:40.893 --> 22:44.831
- I'd like to be a fly
on the wall in Julien's forge,

22:44.864 --> 22:46.933
the conversations that
he must have with himself,

22:46.966 --> 22:48.468
both in English and French.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.846
*

22:59.879 --> 23:02.715
- JW has cleaned up his blade,

23:02.749 --> 23:05.117
he's got his scales
glued on there,

23:05.151 --> 23:06.753
he's drilling out the holes,

23:06.786 --> 23:08.888
Nothing fancy, just a handle.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.558
- Clean and classic.
Nothing wrong with that.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.592
- Easy now.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.594
*

23:14.627 --> 23:16.763
I finish the pins out
with the slack belt

23:16.796 --> 23:18.164
and get them smoothed off
where they're blended

23:18.197 --> 23:19.866
back to the wood.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.602
Oh, my goodness.
Time is running out

23:22.635 --> 23:24.904
and I know I'm running
the clock to the very end,

23:24.937 --> 23:27.774
but all I need to do
is just some final finish,

23:27.807 --> 23:29.175
and then I'm good to go.

23:29.208 --> 23:32.011
*

23:32.044 --> 23:34.881
- Ten, nine, eight,

23:34.914 --> 23:37.684
seven, six, five,

23:37.717 --> 23:41.087
four, three, two, one.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.923
Bladesmiths, your time is up.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.892
This round is over.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.627
[applause]

23:47.660 --> 23:50.096
- Time is up.
[exhales dramatically]

23:50.129 --> 23:55.802
I have a bad feeling because
they've done such nice blade,

23:55.835 --> 23:58.705
so I'm a bit anxious.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.607
*

24:00.640 --> 24:02.842
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to our strength test,

24:02.875 --> 24:04.844
the log chop.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.613
I'm gonna take
each of your knives,

24:06.646 --> 24:08.080
and I'm gonna deliver
ten strikes

24:08.114 --> 24:10.182
into this very
impressive chunk of wood.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.752
How far I get
into the log, I don't care.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.854
What I want to see is what the
log is gonna do to your knife

24:14.887 --> 24:17.524
and how it's gonna hold up.
Julien, you ready?

24:17.557 --> 24:20.793
- Oui. [speaks French]
- Yeah, okay,

24:20.827 --> 24:23.763
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's see what it can do.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.634
- The only thing
I can think about

24:27.667 --> 24:30.169
is the fear
that my blade breaks.

24:32.138 --> 24:39.111
*

24:44.551 --> 24:47.920
[exhales]

24:47.954 --> 24:49.522
- Julien,
you've got a razor here.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.157
I mean, after ten blows,

24:51.190 --> 24:53.125
there's not even
a shiny spot on here.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.261
Great job on that.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.296
One thing I didn't like,
though, is the handle.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.732
It dug into my hand viciously.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.669
Some kind of smoothed-out handle
with some contour to it

25:02.702 --> 25:04.070
and a swell on the back,

25:04.103 --> 25:05.972
that would've been
a huge difference.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.540
But overall, your knife
held up very well.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.041
Good job.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.743
- Thank you.
- JW, how you feeling?

25:10.777 --> 25:12.011
- Feeling good.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.014
I am a little apprehensive,

25:15.047 --> 25:16.849
mainly because the log chop

25:16.883 --> 25:19.151
is the absolute worst thing

25:19.185 --> 25:21.053
you can do to the blade.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.155
You start having that
doubt creep in, you know.

25:25.792 --> 25:32.765
*

25:36.936 --> 25:38.738
- All right, JW,
I've been preaching something

25:38.771 --> 25:40.873
for four seasons.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.209
A knife does not have to be
thick and heavy to be strong.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.578
This is light, and this is fast.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.715
Not a blemish on it.
It just sunk into that wood.

25:48.748 --> 25:52.652
The only thing I would've
liked is up in here,

25:52.685 --> 25:54.186
just a little rounding on that.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.822
Overall, great job.

25:55.855 --> 25:56.823
- Thank you.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.658
- Guillermo, listo?

25:58.691 --> 25:59.659
- Listo.

26:08.134 --> 26:15.107
*

26:19.245 --> 26:21.714
- Guillermo, we've got an issue.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.791
Guillermo, we've got an issue
with the handle.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.259
When you were assembling
your handle,

26:33.292 --> 26:36.128
not enough epoxy
got down in here.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.064
You can see where
there's air cavities.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.899
So, striking that log,

26:39.932 --> 26:42.134
all that energy
transferring into the tang

26:42.168 --> 26:45.271
just had nothing to support it,
so it fractured the wood out.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.808
That being said, though,
your knife edge is beautiful.

26:48.841 --> 26:52.144
Everything stayed straight.
The handle's the problem.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.714
*

26:54.747 --> 26:57.650
- Guillermo, your blade suffered
a catastrophic failure

26:57.684 --> 26:59.919
in the handle
and can no longer be tested.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.689
For that reason, we have to ask
you to please leave the Forge.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.037
*

27:18.070 --> 27:21.708
- Julien, JW, it's come down
to France and the United States

27:21.741 --> 27:24.410
in our first-ever
international competition.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.278
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

27:26.312 --> 27:29.115
to recreate an iconic
weapon from history.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.349
Are you ready to see what it is?

27:30.382 --> 27:31.951
- Not really.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.087
- Well, that weapon is...

27:35.121 --> 27:36.689
the spadroon.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.959
*

27:39.992 --> 27:43.095
Originally an English sword,
the spadroon gained popularity

27:43.129 --> 27:45.164
among French and American
military officers

27:45.197 --> 27:47.934
during 18th-century warfare.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.136
As the official
British infantry sword,

27:50.169 --> 27:52.304
it's broad fuller
made it light in weight,

27:52.338 --> 27:54.907
while its sharp single edge
delivered swift

27:54.941 --> 27:57.409
and fatal thrusts
across enemy lines.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.345
The hilt of the spadroon

27:59.378 --> 28:01.047
featured a decorative
five-balled guard

28:01.080 --> 28:02.348
that served as
an embellishment

28:02.381 --> 28:04.784
for European spadroons.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.053
This became a regulation style
for the American military,

28:07.086 --> 28:09.055
making it one of history's
most attractive

28:09.088 --> 28:11.390
yet deadliest weapons.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.226
After five days, you will return
and present your spadroons

28:14.260 --> 28:16.228
to our panel of expert judges,

28:16.262 --> 28:18.030
and only after
they've tested them

28:18.064 --> 28:19.999
will they declare one of you

28:20.032 --> 28:23.069
the very first international
"Forged in Fire" champion

28:23.102 --> 28:26.005
and hand you that check
for 10 grand, U.S.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.473
- Yeah.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.008
- All right, bladesmiths,
good luck.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.978
We'll see you in five days.

28:32.011 --> 28:35.047
[dynamic music]

28:35.081 --> 28:36.182
- We're here today in
the northwest corner

28:36.215 --> 28:38.050
of the state of Louisiana.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.752
Winning the international
competition

28:39.786 --> 28:41.988
means more than anybody
could even know.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.891
I am a patriot,
I mean, to the core.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.493
I'm fired up.
We're gonna build a spadroon.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.762
I've not done a sword this long,

28:49.796 --> 28:51.798
but I'm gonna do a
ladder-pattern Damascus blade.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.166
We got 31 layers
in this layup right here.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.503
Right now we've got 62 layers.
We draw that bar back out

28:57.536 --> 29:01.540
and put it back over on top
of itself to give us 124 layers.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.309
I think the most
challenging aspect is,

29:03.342 --> 29:05.144
this is a short amount of time

29:05.177 --> 29:06.779
to build what
we're trying to build.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.480
Absolutely
anything can happen.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.050
I'm having to back way
out of what my norm is.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.551
A little bit more
straightening on the bar

29:12.584 --> 29:14.153
and then we're gonna
go over there

29:14.186 --> 29:15.955
and start
knocking the highs off.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.324
The grinding's gonna be
a lengthy process.

29:18.357 --> 29:22.228
I hope I'm gonna have
enough time to finish.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.397
*

29:25.431 --> 29:29.468
- I'm happy to be home
in Saint-Sigismond in France.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.171
Look at the nice view
behind us.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.340
It's magnificent.

29:34.373 --> 29:38.244
So I start to make my tip,
but I have to be really fast

29:38.277 --> 29:42.381
because more you hit your blade,
less carbon you have.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.382
*

29:45.551 --> 29:48.154
It's like music.
[speaking French]

29:48.187 --> 29:50.456
I love to do some music
with my hammer.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.525
[hums, laughs]

29:53.559 --> 29:56.996
It just get you some rhythm.
It's just more fun.

29:57.029 --> 30:01.000
*

30:01.033 --> 30:05.137
Today I did it all:
the tang, the tip, the blade.

30:05.171 --> 30:09.375
All I have left is to
grind it a little bit,

30:09.408 --> 30:12.078
and it's going very well.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.080
[speaks French]

30:14.113 --> 30:16.315
- I'm excited to get started
this morning.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.384
Fixing to start
profiling everything,

30:18.417 --> 30:21.453
so I'm gonna spend a bunch
of time with the grinder today.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.389
With the length
of this blade, I mean,

30:23.422 --> 30:25.424
it's like grinding
three 10-inch bowie knives.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.393
You got a ton of work.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.997
*

30:31.030 --> 30:33.099
Just getting everything
rough ground out.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.234
We're just about ready
to go to heat-treat on it.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.303
Right now would be the time
for a little prayer.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.305
The grinding process
was slower than

30:39.338 --> 30:41.507
I would've liked for it to be,

30:41.540 --> 30:45.011
so this is a short amount
of time left to heat-treat.

30:45.044 --> 30:52.018
*

30:55.687 --> 30:57.990
God.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.326
I noticed it's curved
from the top down,

31:00.359 --> 31:01.961
and it just--heart sinks.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.463
I've got to do something
to correct this.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.298
I know I can't fix it cold,

31:06.332 --> 31:09.335
so we got to go back in
and heat-treat again.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.637
I take it out of the oil,
and I've got the same thing,

31:11.670 --> 31:14.941
and I'm thinking I'm gonna have
to regroup and start over.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.209
*

31:17.243 --> 31:20.379
- So, today I'm gonna work
to be ready for the quench.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.114
The quench is important

31:22.148 --> 31:24.984
because
if the quench is not good,

31:25.017 --> 31:26.518
my blade's gonna be like butter,

31:26.552 --> 31:29.421
and she gonna bend
at the first shot.

31:29.455 --> 31:36.428
*

31:38.397 --> 31:39.365
I think it bent.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.200
Oh, [bleep].

31:41.233 --> 31:43.702
I know that there's
a weak point on my blade

31:43.735 --> 31:45.471
that would make the curve.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.373
So I have to do a second one.

31:47.406 --> 31:54.346
*

31:58.550 --> 32:00.586
[blowing]

32:00.619 --> 32:02.321
[whistles]
Boom.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.190
*

32:04.223 --> 32:06.458
Third quench,
this one goes down.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.061
I don't want to
do another one.

32:09.095 --> 32:14.300
*

32:14.333 --> 32:16.068
[whistles]

32:16.102 --> 32:18.537
I have to make another blade.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.039
I have to restart everything.

32:20.072 --> 32:25.744
Oh, [bleep] [bleep].

32:25.777 --> 32:27.513
I don't want to do another
blade,

32:27.546 --> 32:28.680
but I've got
my country behind me,

32:28.714 --> 32:31.984
so I have to show them
that I respect them

32:32.018 --> 32:33.185
and give the best.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.186
Yeah.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.288
*

32:36.322 --> 32:38.390
- I thought about it a lot,
what happened yesterday.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.292
I've got plenty to work with,

32:40.326 --> 32:43.029
but I still got
a slight curve in the spine,

32:43.062 --> 32:46.298
so what I'm gonna have to do
is grind that away.

32:46.332 --> 32:49.401
*

32:49.435 --> 32:51.670
It's going good.

32:51.703 --> 32:55.074
As I'm grinding, I can tell
that thing's gonna be okay.

32:55.107 --> 32:58.077
What a huge relief that is.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.046
And now that
this blade issue is fixed,

33:00.079 --> 33:01.613
I can focus on fit and finish.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.249
What's challenging about it is

33:03.282 --> 33:04.750
getting the sizing right
on it.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.318
Instead of having
a round handle,

33:06.352 --> 33:08.320
we're gonna have
an oval handle.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.421
There's just
nothing comfortable

33:09.455 --> 33:11.357
about a round handle

33:11.390 --> 33:12.291
when you're striking
something on an angle.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.226
Done deal.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.095
I've got real high
expectations of it,

33:16.128 --> 33:18.164
I really do.
I think it's gonna do well.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.531
*

33:19.565 --> 33:21.333
- I've done a new blade,

33:21.367 --> 33:23.435
and the second one
is just better.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.205
I'm really happy.
I got the banana.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.307
You see?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.576
So, today,
I have to make the D-guard,

33:30.609 --> 33:32.144
make some branches, as well.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.613
I can do a twist together.

33:34.646 --> 33:35.714
It's gonna work.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.084
[exhales]
I'm happy.

33:38.117 --> 33:41.753
And now I have to do the
leather handle, and I'm done.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.390
I've got 47 layers of leather,

33:44.423 --> 33:46.825
but the leather's
not going down.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.728
It's so sticky, so squeezy.

33:49.761 --> 33:54.666
It doesn't move, so I have
to hammer to make it go down.

33:54.700 --> 34:00.506
*

34:00.539 --> 34:02.374
[groans]

34:02.408 --> 34:03.709
*

34:03.742 --> 34:05.444
[bleep].

34:07.413 --> 34:09.315
[bleep].

34:09.348 --> 34:11.083
But it's not important
for the blade,

34:11.117 --> 34:12.718
so I'm still working on it,

34:12.751 --> 34:15.787
but I feel like
I don't like it anymore,

34:15.821 --> 34:17.489
so I'm [bleep] mad now.

34:17.523 --> 34:18.557
[sighs]

34:18.590 --> 34:22.494
*

34:22.528 --> 34:24.330
- Bladesmiths, welcome back.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.132
You are both one step closer

34:26.165 --> 34:28.667
to the title of
our very first international

34:28.700 --> 34:30.369
"Forged in Fire" champion.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.238
Julien,
you went back to France.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.739
How did it go?

34:33.772 --> 34:35.707
- It was just
a beautiful nightmare.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.609
*

34:37.643 --> 34:39.778
I never done
one like this before.

34:39.811 --> 34:43.615
It just pushed me
at the maximum of my skills.

34:43.649 --> 34:44.883
- Tres bien.
All right, JW.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.352
How'd it go for you?

34:46.385 --> 34:47.319
- We were able to get it done.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.221
*

34:49.255 --> 34:51.190
I chose to do
ladder-pattern Damascus,

34:51.223 --> 34:52.791
so I've got 124 layers.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.260
It had some heat-treat issues,

34:54.293 --> 34:55.627
but we worked through it.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.563
Producing Damascus is what I do.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.465
*

34:59.498 --> 35:01.567
- Gentlemen, both of your
weapons look fantastic,

35:01.600 --> 35:03.502
but now it's time
to see how they hold up

35:03.535 --> 35:04.770
in our weapons test.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.606
Up first, the kill test.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.341
Doug?

35:09.375 --> 35:12.211
*

35:12.244 --> 35:14.813
- Bladesmiths, to find out
how lethal your weapons are,

35:14.846 --> 35:17.549
I will deliver some slashes and
thrusts on these pig carcasses.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.585
Julien, you're up first.
Are you ready?

35:19.618 --> 35:22.721
- I think so.
- Let's do this.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.423
- I'm French.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.692
I'm representing my country,

35:26.725 --> 35:27.893
so I'm panicking.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.761
It's total panic.

35:32.398 --> 35:39.405
*

35:52.684 --> 35:55.387
- All right, Julien, let's talk
about your sword here.

35:55.421 --> 35:57.423
It's a bit on the heavier side.

35:57.456 --> 36:01.627
Your edge easily lacerates
into the pig carcass.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.196
On the thrust,
it penetrates deep.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.465
Your weapon definitely is sharp.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.966
Your sword will kill.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.735
- Thank you.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.603
- JW, you're next.
Are you ready?

36:11.637 --> 36:13.439
- I think so.
- Let's do this.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.941
- I am really impressed
with Julien's blade.

36:15.974 --> 36:19.245
His knife performed really well,
so I felt good for him,

36:19.278 --> 36:20.879
and now I'm nervous for me.

36:20.912 --> 36:27.886
*

36:42.934 --> 36:46.805
- Okay, JW, let's talk
about your spadroon here.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.874
The fact that you put a fuller
all the way through up here

36:48.907 --> 36:50.642
lightened your sword a lot.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.478
It is so sharp,

36:52.511 --> 36:55.414
it almost cut all the way
through this carcass.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.750
Overall, your weapon will kill.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.253
- Thank you, Doug.
- Now, Donald McBane,

37:01.287 --> 37:02.421
who wrote the book
on this weapon,

37:02.454 --> 37:04.356
called it the shearing sword,

37:04.390 --> 37:05.657
so to test the sharpness
of your blades,

37:05.691 --> 37:07.593
I'll be chopping
through this rope

37:07.626 --> 37:10.296
and then attacking these
sandbags as they fall.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.630
Julien, you're up.
Are you ready?

37:11.663 --> 37:12.931
- Oui.
- Okay.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.570
*

37:18.604 --> 37:19.571
- [exhales]

37:19.605 --> 37:22.040
*

37:22.073 --> 37:23.775
- I'll get him.

37:23.809 --> 37:29.681
*

37:33.419 --> 37:35.821
- Yes.
It's good.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.022
- Good job.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.424
- It's fricking good.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.627
- Well, Julien, that's sharp.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.495
It passed right
through the ropes.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.697
It passed right
through the bags.

37:45.731 --> 37:49.435
But the weight in this sword
and the shape of its handle

37:49.468 --> 37:53.872
just have a tendency
to be very hard to stop.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.641
A little thinner handle
possibly,

37:55.674 --> 37:56.875
a little more indexed...

37:56.908 --> 37:58.510
- Yeah.
- Would've helped.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.679
But it's definitely
a sharp sword.

38:00.712 --> 38:01.780
- Thank you very much.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.949
- Sir, you are next.

38:03.982 --> 38:04.950
Are you ready?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.518
- Yes, sir.

38:06.552 --> 38:13.459
*

38:28.540 --> 38:31.443
- [laughs]

38:31.477 --> 38:34.480
*

38:34.513 --> 38:37.115
- Definitely sharp enough
to cut through the ropes.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.385
Your handle, would've been
nice to see it taper

38:39.418 --> 38:40.919
and swell a little bit more,

38:40.952 --> 38:42.488
but it's definitely a cutter.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.455
- Thank you.
Thank you, Dave.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.457
- Nicely done.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.058
All right, gentlemen,
next up is the strength test.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.694
- The strength test is where

38:48.727 --> 38:50.762
everybody's stuff's
on the table.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.798
- Now, to test the strength
and durability of your blades,

38:52.831 --> 38:55.767
I'll be thrusting with the tip
and cutting into these hardwood,

38:55.801 --> 38:57.135
leather-wrapped shields.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.937
JW, are you ready for this?

38:58.970 --> 39:01.006
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.141
- After the first two tests,
I'm feeling pretty nervous.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.510
They were pretty equal.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.383
You don't have a clue to what's
going on at this point.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.619
Lord, let it stay together.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.588
[rock music]

39:16.622 --> 39:23.562
*

39:28.099 --> 39:30.035
- Well, everything on
the blade looks good.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.070
Guard's still tight.
Handle hasn't moved.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.472
I think you did a great job.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.973
- Thank you, Dave.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.476
- Julien, are you ready?

39:37.509 --> 39:39.144
- Good luck.
[laughs]

39:39.177 --> 39:42.113
[tense music]

39:42.147 --> 39:44.015
*

39:45.150 --> 39:48.086
[rock music]

39:48.119 --> 39:55.093
*

39:57.796 --> 39:59.698
- [sighs]

39:59.731 --> 40:03.001
- So, Julien, we got
a very stout edge profile.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.003
Blade's still straight.
Well done.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.638
- Thank you so much.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.874
*

40:08.907 --> 40:11.477
- Julien, JW,
welcome back to the Forge.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.879
The judges' deliberation
is complete.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.448
Before I tell you what
their final answer is,

40:16.482 --> 40:18.183
they have feedback
for both of you.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.118
[tense music]

40:20.151 --> 40:22.921
- JW, your sense of
scale and balance,

40:22.954 --> 40:25.891
combined with that steel
you put in that blade,

40:25.924 --> 40:28.494
just put together a weapon
that was a joy to use,

40:28.527 --> 40:30.128
as well as to look at.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.196
I think you did
a fabulous job with that.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.064
- Thank you, Dave.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.000
*

40:35.033 --> 40:37.469
- Julien,
your spadroon is dangerous.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.505
It's sharp.
It's strong.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.506
Good job.

40:40.539 --> 40:41.573
- Thank you.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.074
- Well, gentlemen,

40:43.108 --> 40:45.210
the judges have made
their decision.

40:45.243 --> 40:48.179
Our very first "Forged in Fire"
international champion is...

40:48.213 --> 40:51.683
*

40:51.717 --> 40:52.718
JW.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.052
Congratulations.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.754
You are our first
"Forged in Fire"

40:55.787 --> 40:57.155
international champion.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.557
Julien.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.258
- Oui.
- Unfortunately,

41:00.291 --> 41:02.894
your blade did not make the cut.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.663
J. Neilson will explain.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.966
- Julien, you brought us
a beautiful piece,

41:07.999 --> 41:10.135
but compared
to your competitor,

41:10.168 --> 41:12.904
your blade was a lot heavier
in the front balance-wise,

41:12.938 --> 41:14.973
and with that round handle,

41:15.006 --> 41:16.508
it made it a lot harder
to control in the testing.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.977
That's why
we're gonna let you go.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.079
- Julien, c'est finit, mon ami.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.981
Please, surrender your weapon.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.716
- Okay.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.785
*

41:26.818 --> 41:28.086
Thank you, guys.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.556
I'm very proud of this blade,

41:30.589 --> 41:33.825
but JW is a god.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.961
He is a god in the forge.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.563
*

41:37.596 --> 41:40.799
And this guy is my friend.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.834
*

41:42.868 --> 41:44.803
- JW, the American

41:44.836 --> 41:46.938
and our very first
"Forged in Fire"

41:46.972 --> 41:48.874
international champion.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.943
It's a title that also comes
with a check for $10,000.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.579
Congratulations.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.181
Please present your weapon
to the judges.

41:56.214 --> 41:59.017
- I put forth
a lot of hard work, time,

41:59.050 --> 42:01.553
and effort to reach this point,

42:01.587 --> 42:03.722
so it's just been
an incredible honor

42:03.755 --> 42:06.224
to be asked
to represent my country.

42:06.257 --> 42:08.259
And not only that,
but being able to meet guys

42:08.293 --> 42:10.128
from different parts
of the world

42:10.161 --> 42:11.997
and the friendships
that we developed

42:12.030 --> 42:13.999
was just a great experience,

42:14.032 --> 42:15.601
and that's what
it's all about.

42:15.634 --> 42:16.568
