WEBVTT

00:04.656 --> 00:06.356
Yeah, I just had lunch
with my husband

00:06.358 --> 00:07.824
and I'm on my way home.

00:07.826 --> 00:10.293
I have a lot to do
before the meeting tonight.

00:10.295 --> 00:13.363
Of course I'll be there, but I hope
there's more on the agenda

00:13.365 --> 00:14.797
than the charity ball.

00:14.799 --> 00:18.067
I don't want to debate
which caterer to use for an hour.

00:18.069 --> 00:20.336
I'd gladly
vote for corn dogs

00:20.338 --> 00:21.938
if it ends the meeting sooner.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.140
See you tonight.

00:25.176 --> 00:28.011
And that was the last known
sighting of Sophie Troy,

00:28.013 --> 00:30.213
at 2:37 p.m.
on a surveillance video.

00:30.215 --> 00:32.649
She was coming from having
lunch with her husband,

00:32.651 --> 00:36.085
and she was going home using
the congressional underground tunnels.

00:36.087 --> 00:37.520
Ok, so it's 3 a.m. now.

00:37.522 --> 00:39.322
She's been gone
a little over 12 hours.

00:39.324 --> 00:41.157
That doesn't qualify
as a missing person yet.

00:41.159 --> 00:43.860
The director's personally
asked us to handle the case.

00:43.862 --> 00:45.862
Her husband is Congressman
Benjamin Troy,

00:45.864 --> 00:47.830
which makes her a VIP.

00:47.832 --> 00:49.566
Well, the question is,
who's the real target,

00:49.568 --> 00:50.934
Sophie or her husband?

00:50.936 --> 00:52.902
I mean, is this an attempt
to influence him?

00:52.904 --> 00:54.837
Well, the Congressman
isn't very high profile.

00:54.839 --> 00:57.373
It's his first term, and he has views
which have made him

00:57.375 --> 00:59.542
unpopular on both sides
of the aisle.

00:59.544 --> 01:01.811
Sophie's a healthcare
lawyer on the D.C. museum board.

01:01.813 --> 01:03.880
What was her schedule
after lunch? Do you know?

01:03.882 --> 01:05.447
Yeah. She was gonna
go home,

01:05.450 --> 01:07.517
and then she had
a foundation meeting at 7:00.

01:07.519 --> 01:08.651
She didn't make either.

01:08.653 --> 01:10.153
Then when she wasn't home
by 12:30,

01:10.155 --> 01:11.654
the Congressman called
family and friends

01:11.656 --> 01:13.489
before contacting
Capitol police at 1:45.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.391
We were notified
a half an hour later.

01:15.393 --> 01:17.126
Let's go back
to her last sighting.

01:17.128 --> 01:19.762
Do we have the surveillance footage
from the other side of the stairwell?

01:19.764 --> 01:21.864
Yeah. That would be
the Library of Congress lobby

01:21.866 --> 01:23.066
and there's no sign of her.

01:23.068 --> 01:24.968
It's like she vanished
into thin air.

01:24.970 --> 01:28.071
Guys, it is possible
she just left of her own accord.

01:28.073 --> 01:30.039
But we have to assume
it's a kidnapping

01:30.041 --> 01:31.608
unless proven otherwise.

01:31.610 --> 01:34.711
Well, we know she was
on the phone before she disappeared.

01:34.713 --> 01:37.313
We need to pull all her email
and cell phone records.

01:37.315 --> 01:40.249
The Congressman's here.

01:40.251 --> 01:42.018
Have a seat,
Congressman.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.020
I've heard the statistics.
What do we have,

01:44.022 --> 01:45.521
36 hours or something
to save her?

01:45.523 --> 01:47.390
In a homicide, the first 48 hours
are the most critical,

01:47.392 --> 01:49.626
but in an abduction,
every minute counts.

01:49.628 --> 01:51.194
Oh, God.

01:51.196 --> 01:54.197
We don't know for sure
that there's been foul play.

01:54.199 --> 01:56.165
No. No, no.
I know my wife.

01:56.167 --> 01:58.735
We just had our
first anniversary a week ago.

01:58.737 --> 02:00.036
She wouldn't just leave me,

02:00.038 --> 02:02.605
certainly not without
getting the last word in.

02:02.607 --> 02:05.041
Is there anyone
who would want to hurt her?

02:05.043 --> 02:06.709
No. No, no.

02:06.711 --> 02:10.013
Sophie's a wonderful,
sweet woman.

02:10.014 --> 02:11.881
I, on the other hand,

02:11.883 --> 02:14.183
I'm not very well-liked
in this town.

02:14.185 --> 02:16.552
And who are your enemies?

02:16.554 --> 02:18.254
Well, where do we begin?

02:18.256 --> 02:20.490
We have the oil lobbies.

02:20.492 --> 02:23.459
Uh, we have the NRA
and PETA.

02:23.461 --> 02:26.162
You have an equal
opportunity offender.

02:26.164 --> 02:27.830
Plus, then there's
all the other oddballs

02:27.832 --> 02:29.332
who call, write letters,
send emails.

02:29.334 --> 02:31.501
My aides don't usually
show them to me, though.

02:31.503 --> 02:33.336
We'll need to see those.

02:33.338 --> 02:34.804
Yeah, I'll have my office
send them over.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.306
And also let them know
that we're on an information lockdown.

02:37.308 --> 02:41.678
Our chances of solving this are better
if the media doesn't get wind of it.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.946
You know, I understand
people being angry with me,

02:43.948 --> 02:45.715
but to take it out
on my family,

02:45.717 --> 02:47.016
on Sophie...

02:47.018 --> 02:50.053
Rest assured,
you're our priority.

02:53.458 --> 02:54.624
Excuse me.

02:55.894 --> 02:58.861
The tech analysis from the video
surveillance came back.

02:58.863 --> 03:00.463
The footage from
the Library of Congress

03:00.465 --> 03:01.964
where there's no sign
of Sophie

03:01.966 --> 03:03.466
is an old video
on a continuous loop.

03:03.468 --> 03:04.801
Someone hacked the system?

03:04.803 --> 03:06.736
It's run by the Metro P.D.
it's outdated.

03:06.738 --> 03:08.671
It wouldn't take
a lot of brainpower to get in.

03:08.673 --> 03:10.339
I have just received
confirmation

03:10.341 --> 03:11.641
authorities have been alerted

03:11.643 --> 03:14.210
and are treating this
as a probable abduction.

03:14.212 --> 03:16.412
Just to recap, Sophie Troy,

03:16.414 --> 03:18.247
wife of Congressman
Benjamin Troy,

03:18.249 --> 03:21.150
has been missing since
mid-afternoon yesterday.

03:21.152 --> 03:22.919
At this time, authorities
have not said when...

03:22.921 --> 03:24.253
What's going on?
Who leaked this?

03:24.255 --> 03:25.621
I don't know.

03:25.623 --> 03:26.956
Hotch.

03:26.958 --> 03:30.126
The last call Sophie made
was to a lawyer on vacation.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.328
This is her voicemail.

03:33.498 --> 03:36.132
Hi, Tania, it's Sophie,
and I'm still out of town--

03:36.134 --> 03:37.100
oops--sorry.

03:37.102 --> 03:38.701
What are you doing?

03:38.703 --> 03:39.902
Stop, let go of me!

03:39.904 --> 03:42.098
No--aah!

04:19.968 --> 04:21.935
See that shadow
on the wall?

04:21.937 --> 04:24.170
It shifted
as the sun went down,

04:24.172 --> 04:26.039
but now it's back.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.608
The video was on
a 6-hour loop before it repeated,

04:28.610 --> 04:30.476
which is why no one
noticed it right away.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.279
So this was organized
and premeditated.

04:33.281 --> 04:35.081
Ok, so even though
this isn't the real footage,

04:35.083 --> 04:37.483
the lobby would have been
crowded with tourists at the time.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.886
How was she taken in broad daylight
from a public place?

04:39.888 --> 04:42.155
Ironically, it may have been
easier to kidnap her in a crowd.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.824
It's noisy, hard to see,
people are distracted.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.125
If she was injected
with a sedative,

04:46.127 --> 04:47.827
the kidnappers might
just look like friends or family

04:47.829 --> 04:49.429
helping someone
who was feeling ill.

04:49.431 --> 04:51.531
We'll set up a trace phone,
and I've already got agents

04:51.533 --> 04:53.733
looking into terrorism and
organized crime connections.

04:53.735 --> 04:55.735
I also need to know
on what committees you sit

04:55.737 --> 04:58.204
and what pending bills might
be influenced by your vote.

04:58.206 --> 05:00.073
Right. I'm on the energy
subcommittee.

05:00.075 --> 05:02.809
There's a vote in two days
to ban fracking on the Pacific Coast.

05:02.811 --> 05:04.611
Where do you stand
on the issue?

05:04.613 --> 05:06.779
I'm for the ban, but
I've been getting pressure

05:06.781 --> 05:08.348
from the oil companies
to vote against it.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.949
They're not the most
subtle people in the world.

05:09.951 --> 05:11.451
Do you think maybe they have
something to do with this?

05:11.453 --> 05:13.720
Well, just to be safe,
I think you and your family

05:13.722 --> 05:15.355
should stay here
in protective custody

05:15.357 --> 05:16.856
until we get a better
handle on things.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.658
Ok. It's just my brother
and my mother.

05:18.660 --> 05:19.826
They're in Georgetown.

05:19.828 --> 05:21.160
They live together?

05:21.162 --> 05:22.795
Paul just got out of rehab
a couple of months ago.

05:22.797 --> 05:24.664
He's staying with her till
he gets back on his feet.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.165
We'll arrange to have them picked up.
Agent Anderson,

05:26.167 --> 05:28.201
will you please show the Congressman
where he can stay?

05:28.203 --> 05:31.404
Sure. Congressman,
right this way.

05:32.641 --> 05:34.641
So, uh, we confirmed
the Congressman

05:34.643 --> 05:36.309
was in his office
all afternoon.

05:36.311 --> 05:38.177
There was nothing unusual
about his behavior.

05:38.179 --> 05:40.647
And he's responding
appropriately.

05:40.649 --> 05:43.850
Yeah, Dave,
what have you got?

05:43.852 --> 05:45.385
We'll be right down.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.621
Organized crime may have
a lead on the case.

05:48.623 --> 05:49.989
So who's the package?

05:49.991 --> 05:53.126
Who cares? Dyadya just said
it's someone important.

05:53.128 --> 05:54.527
What's our piece
of the action?

05:54.529 --> 05:55.962
Maybe 5 grand.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.734
Which translates into,
“he'll call us, we just sit tight.”

06:01.736 --> 06:03.102
These are low-level guys?

06:03.104 --> 06:04.871
Foot soldiers in
the the Mikhalov Bratva,

06:04.873 --> 06:07.473
a Russian crime ring
that deals in illegal arms.

06:07.475 --> 06:10.777
We intercepted a container
of Stinger missiles about 6 months ago

06:10.779 --> 06:12.378
they were gonna ship
to Syria.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.113
Been trying to infiltrate
the ring since then,

06:14.115 --> 06:15.948
figure out who
the major players are.

06:15.950 --> 06:17.450
Where is the wiretap?

06:17.452 --> 06:19.752
In their apartment.
This recording is from a week ago.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.288
And you think it's connected
to Sophie Troy?

06:22.290 --> 06:23.756
Well, here's what we know.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.793
These low-level guys often do
freelance work to pad their income.

06:26.795 --> 06:29.562
You need somebody for an unsavory job,
this is who you call.

06:29.564 --> 06:31.397
1-800-thug.

06:31.399 --> 06:32.965
Yeah, pretty much.
This kidnapping

06:32.967 --> 06:35.068
they're talking about
was gonna go down around now.

06:35.070 --> 06:36.436
Well, probably
not a coincidence.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.838
According to Loker,
our agent on site,

06:38.840 --> 06:41.841
they're still waiting for Dyadya,
which means uncle, to call.

06:41.843 --> 06:43.276
Any idea who uncle is?

06:43.278 --> 06:45.645
No. We've been trying
to I.D. him, but no luck so far.

06:45.647 --> 06:47.714
I think we need
to be on this.

06:47.716 --> 06:50.616
You're welcome to join us as long
as you don't jeopardize our case.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.019

Hi. Um, I'm looking for Loker.

07:31.087 --> 07:32.754
Thanks.

07:36.059 --> 07:37.358
I'm Dorian Loker.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.993
You must be from the BAU?

07:38.995 --> 07:40.528
Yeah, I'm Spencer--
I don't really shake hands.

07:40.530 --> 07:42.697
Great. So we're set up in here.

07:42.699 --> 07:44.832
The apartment's directly
across the courtyard.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.334
The guys just left
to get breakfast.

07:46.336 --> 07:47.669
What do we know
about them?

07:47.671 --> 07:50.505
Roman Azarof and Taras Yudin
work at a trucking company

07:50.507 --> 07:54.542
in Anacostia, but really
it's just a front for the Russian mob.

07:54.544 --> 07:57.245
Roman's bad news.
He assaulted a shopkeeper

07:57.247 --> 07:58.913
with a chainsaw
back in 2008.

07:58.915 --> 08:01.516
Which one has the uncle that
may have kidnapped Sophie Troy?

08:01.518 --> 08:04.218
Taras. But uncle
is a loose term.

08:04.220 --> 08:07.055
As far as we know, Taras has
no blood relatives in the U.S.

08:07.057 --> 08:08.990
He's only been here two years.

08:08.992 --> 08:12.126
It could be any older figure
in this crime network.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.103
Good.

08:22.105 --> 08:24.439
There's a lot of down time
in surveillance.

08:24.441 --> 08:26.708
I hope you brought
something to read.

08:26.710 --> 08:27.712
“Great Expectations.”
You like Charles Dickens?

08:27.736 --> 08:29.611
Believe it or not,
I haven't read him before.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.164
Figured it was high time
to change that.

08:31.188 --> 08:32.804
He's great that moment
where Pip finally learns

08:32.804 --> 08:34.424
that Estella was always groomed
to break men's hearts always---

08:34.448 --> 08:36.128
Always trying--
I haven't gotten there yet.

08:37.847 --> 08:40.881
Oh, well, I think
you're gonna like that part.

08:41.918 --> 08:43.317
Terrific.

08:43.318 --> 08:46.754
I'm gonna go put on
a fresh pot of coffee.

08:56.199 --> 08:57.665
You ok?

08:57.667 --> 08:59.867
Yeah.

08:59.869 --> 09:02.670
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

09:02.672 --> 09:06.707
I just wish I had walked
Sophie to the street after lunch

09:06.709 --> 09:07.808
or called her a cab.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.243
I could have stopped this
somehow.

09:09.245 --> 09:12.847
A lot of families feel that way
after an abduction.

09:12.849 --> 09:16.517
But in most cases it was
an unforeseeable event.

09:18.788 --> 09:23.224
My mother would say it happened
because I wasn't a gentleman.

09:25.528 --> 09:29.430
Well, try not to
beat yourself up too much.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.504
Where's my son?

09:36.506 --> 09:38.906
Hey, how long do you
plan on holding us?

09:38.908 --> 09:40.041
Paul.

09:40.043 --> 09:42.009
Not to be rude,
but I got a life of my own.

09:42.011 --> 09:45.346
I gotta be at the soup
kitchen in an hour to volunteer.

09:45.348 --> 09:47.348
We're not holding you.
This is for your own safety,

09:47.350 --> 09:49.183
so I highly recommend
that you stay.

09:49.185 --> 09:51.786
And while you're here,
you could just really help us out a lot

09:51.788 --> 09:53.421
by answering
a few questions.

09:53.423 --> 09:56.057
Oh, of course, anything you need.
Right, Paul?

09:56.059 --> 09:59.894
Hey, uh, could you tell me
a little about Sophie and Benjamin?

09:59.896 --> 10:01.395
What's their relationship like?

10:01.397 --> 10:04.565
Oh, with Sophie and Benjamin
it's true love.

10:04.567 --> 10:06.867
They met and got married
8 months later.

10:06.869 --> 10:09.503
In his eyes
she can do no wrong.

10:09.505 --> 10:12.606
And one harsh word from her
would just destroy him.

10:12.608 --> 10:14.175
And if you ask her
where they met,

10:14.177 --> 10:16.277
she'd say it was in a garden
under a double rainbow

10:16.279 --> 10:17.311
with a unicorn.

10:17.313 --> 10:19.080
Paul...

10:19.082 --> 10:21.649
And, uh, what do you think
of their marriage?

10:21.651 --> 10:23.718
I have no opinion.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.420
It's between them and God.

10:26.422 --> 10:27.855
God?

10:27.857 --> 10:30.224
Paul found a higher
power in rehab.

10:30.226 --> 10:32.827
He's finally free
of his demons.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.300
What's your relationship
like with Sophie?

10:40.303 --> 10:41.635
It was fine.

10:41.637 --> 10:44.371
Honestly, I barely know her.

10:44.373 --> 10:46.373
They told me
you just got here.

10:46.375 --> 10:49.143
Oh, Benjy.
It's so terrible.

10:51.614 --> 10:53.214
Thanks for coming, bro.

10:53.216 --> 10:56.784
Yeah. Yeah,
I wouldn't miss it.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.860
What's the layout
of their place?

11:05.862 --> 11:07.061
Same as this one.

11:07.063 --> 11:08.562
The satellite dish
outside the window

11:08.564 --> 11:11.665
is actually one of
our parabolic mikes.

11:11.667 --> 11:12.967
They're back.

11:20.385 --> 11:21.385
It's a woman.

11:21.386 --> 11:23.820
It's their cleaning lady, Fana.

11:29.027 --> 11:30.427
She's speaking Yoruba.

11:30.429 --> 11:32.416
It's a western Nigerian
dialect.

11:32.417 --> 11:35.018
She's talking to her mother.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.087
Did you get the money
that I sent?

11:37.089 --> 11:39.622
Yes. We used it all
to buy rice.

11:39.624 --> 11:42.726
Ok. I'll try
to send more when I can.

11:42.728 --> 11:43.827
I have to go.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.362
Fana--

11:53.739 --> 11:55.305
What the hell?

11:55.307 --> 11:56.973
Why you have
the curtains open?

11:56.975 --> 11:58.742
So I could
clean the windows.

11:58.744 --> 12:00.276
But what did we told you?

12:00.278 --> 12:02.345
Keep the damn curtains closed.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.347
How hard is it to remember?

12:04.349 --> 12:08.251
It won't happen again.
I have to go and switch the laundry.

12:08.253 --> 12:10.653
She's an idiot.

12:10.655 --> 12:13.356
Hey, I just got
a text from Dyadya.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.924
He says he'll need us soon.

12:14.926 --> 12:17.160
We should be ready
with a truck.

12:17.162 --> 12:20.163
I gonna go down
to the office.

12:24.803 --> 12:26.569
You speak Yoruba?

12:26.571 --> 12:28.671
I can get by.

12:30.942 --> 12:33.710
This is really good coffee,
by the way.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.046
Coffee's a language in itself.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.548
Who said that? Dickens?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.550
Jackie Chan.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.522
So the gun lobbyists
were dismissive of the Congressman,

12:45.524 --> 12:48.391
saying they don't waste
their time with one-termers like Troy.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.093
But anyway, even if
they were involved,

12:50.095 --> 12:52.462
I highly doubt that they would outsource
the job to the Russian mob.

12:52.464 --> 12:53.830
What about
the oil companies?

12:53.832 --> 12:55.732
Pretty slimy, pun intended,

12:55.734 --> 12:57.734
but none of our sources
say they were involved.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.702
Well, considering how much
oil comes out of Russia,

12:59.704 --> 13:02.238
they are the most likely
candidates to have ties to the mob.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.406
I'm interrupting,
I know,

13:03.408 --> 13:05.108
but, sir, there's
a reporter in the lobby.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.576
She insists to speak to you.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.712
She says she has critical
information about this case.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.652
You must be
SSA Aaron Hotchner.

13:15.654 --> 13:17.620
And you're Madison Young.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.090
I come bearing gifts.

13:20.092 --> 13:22.058
What is that?

13:22.060 --> 13:25.261
The ransom message I received
from the kidnappers at my office.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.931
If you want the flash drive,
I have a request.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.266
You're interfering with
a criminal investigation.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.603
I'd like an exclusive
interview with Congressman Troy.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.271
I know he's here.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.508
I'll leave that
up to him.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.646
My name is Sophie Troy.

13:45.484 --> 13:48.118
If you----

13:48.120 --> 13:51.621
if you want
my safe return,

13:51.623 --> 13:55.291
you will wire
20 million dollars to...

13:56.828 --> 13:58.628
to the bank account number

13:58.630 --> 14:02.265
at the end of this video.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.804
Do not think
to delay payment.

14:07.806 --> 14:12.542
It will only
make it worse for me.

14:13.678 --> 14:19.382
Remember, now, 20 million
by midnight or...

14:19.384 --> 14:20.984
Oh, God.

14:22.721 --> 14:26.856
20 million by midnight
or I die.

14:34.157 --> 14:38.259
Remember, now,
20 million by midnight or...

14:38.561 --> 14:40.727
Oh, God.

14:43.265 --> 14:47.067
20 million by midnight
or I die.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.374
The recording
appears genuine.

14:54.376 --> 14:55.576
Benjy.

14:55.578 --> 14:57.578
The wire instructions
are to a bank in Cyprus.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.880
It's a big tax haven
for the Russians.

14:59.882 --> 15:02.549
Is there any reason why the Russian mob
would want to hurt you?

15:02.551 --> 15:03.917
No.

15:03.919 --> 15:05.619
Then someone hired them.

15:05.621 --> 15:07.054
But who, exactly,

15:07.056 --> 15:08.922
is the 20-million-dollar
question.

15:08.924 --> 15:10.891
It could be anyone.
What does it matter now?

15:10.893 --> 15:13.827
The important question is,
where am I gonna get that kind of money?

15:13.829 --> 15:16.663
Well let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We have to stay rational.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.600
Unless you can guarantee me that
you're gonna rescue my wife by midnight,

15:19.602 --> 15:21.201
I'm not gonna risk
losing her.

15:21.203 --> 15:23.704
Benjy, we don't have
20 million dollars.

15:23.706 --> 15:25.105
Yeah, I know that.

15:25.107 --> 15:26.707
Who asks for
that kind of money?

15:26.709 --> 15:28.275
Someone who thinks
people like Benjamin

15:28.277 --> 15:30.244
have the power
to make anything happen.

15:30.246 --> 15:33.447
They may have seen media reports
on your campaign war chest.

15:33.449 --> 15:36.350
Didn't you get a hefty
donation last week?

15:36.352 --> 15:37.718
What do you have now,
50 million?

15:37.720 --> 15:39.286
But that's not
my personal money.

15:39.288 --> 15:40.921
They don't understand that.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.956
We're dealing with someone
who's not too sophisticated.

15:42.958 --> 15:44.725
Yet this kidnapping
was just the opposite.

15:44.727 --> 15:46.026
It's not adding up.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.495
Benjy, can't we borrow
against your campaign fund?

15:48.497 --> 15:49.830
No. No, that's illegal.

15:49.832 --> 15:53.934
I--I don't know
what to do anymore.

15:53.936 --> 15:56.203
I do.

15:57.606 --> 16:00.474
This message is for the people
who are holding Sophie Troy.

16:00.476 --> 16:03.243
We have received your demands and
we are taking them very seriously.

16:03.245 --> 16:05.812
At this time, we want to ensure
Sophie's well-being

16:05.814 --> 16:08.115
and are willing
to fully cooperate with you.

16:08.117 --> 16:10.784
But in order to do so,
we must have proof of life

16:10.786 --> 16:12.586
and an open channel
of communication.

16:12.588 --> 16:15.455
You can reach us at any time
by calling the FBI hotline.

16:15.457 --> 16:16.790
Again, let me emphasize,

16:16.792 --> 16:19.893
our primary concern
is the well-being of Sophie Troy.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.963
We will do whatever it takes
to ensure her safe return.

16:22.965 --> 16:23.997
Thank you.

16:23.999 --> 16:26.633
I know this must be
a nightmare for you,

16:26.635 --> 16:27.834
Congressman.

16:27.836 --> 16:30.671
Nightmare doesn't even
begin to describe it.

16:30.673 --> 16:33.140
If for some reason
she's able to watch this,

16:33.142 --> 16:34.975
is there anything
you want to say to your wife?

16:34.977 --> 16:37.444
Yes.

16:38.714 --> 16:43.617
Sophie,
you're my entire world,

16:43.619 --> 16:46.820
and I want you to fight..

16:46.822 --> 16:49.089
And don't give up.

16:50.459 --> 16:53.927
I want you to come back to me.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.931
Oh...I can't.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.900
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

16:59.902 --> 17:01.735
Can you turn it off,
please, I--

17:01.737 --> 17:03.837
turn it off, please.

17:16.685 --> 17:18.151
Hey, Garcia,
what do you have?

17:18.153 --> 17:20.520
Taras Yudin
is a very horrible meanie.

17:20.521 --> 17:21.788
What did he do?

17:21.790 --> 17:24.090
In 2012 he was questioned

17:24.093 --> 17:27.227
in the brutal killing
of a gang member's family

17:27.229 --> 17:29.262
in his hometown of Volga,

17:29.264 --> 17:30.764
but then there wasn't
enough evidence,

17:30.766 --> 17:32.432
so the charges were dropped,
and he left Russia.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.167
Is there anyone else
from his hometown in D.C.?

17:34.169 --> 17:36.303
Someone must have helped him
when he first arrived here.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.404
It could be Dyadya.

17:37.406 --> 17:38.905
Oh, it's hard to tell

17:38.907 --> 17:41.241
with all the disposable cell phones
he uses, but keep looking will I.

17:41.243 --> 17:43.844
All right, thank you so much,
Garcia. Bye.

17:43.846 --> 17:45.612
Something's going on.

17:45.614 --> 17:48.181
Dyadya told you
he'd get two million ransom?

17:48.183 --> 17:49.282
Yeah.

17:49.284 --> 17:51.551
That's not
what I heard at the club.

17:51.553 --> 17:53.553
I heard Dyadya's getting
20 million.

17:53.555 --> 17:56.523
20 million.
That's a lot of money.

17:56.525 --> 17:58.892
Son of a bitch
has been lying to you.

17:58.894 --> 18:02.396
And what was he gonna
give us, a measly 5 grand?

18:02.398 --> 18:03.697
I don't believe it.

18:03.699 --> 18:07.567
You don't believe it,
talk to Ivan.

18:08.771 --> 18:10.170
Who's Ivan?

18:10.172 --> 18:12.205
A bartender
at the local strip club.

18:12.207 --> 18:13.273
We have a source down there.

18:13.275 --> 18:16.410
Hotch, hey,
the ransom changed.

18:16.412 --> 18:17.911
It used to just be
two million.

18:17.913 --> 18:19.279
All right, Reid.
Thank you.

18:19.281 --> 18:21.782
Ok, if a call comes in,
one of us is gonna answer.

18:21.784 --> 18:23.216
We may ask you to speak,

18:23.218 --> 18:25.218
but what's most important
is you'll have to stay calm.

18:25.220 --> 18:26.853
I followed up
with some oil execs.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.089
It turns out those with stakes
in Russian companies

18:29.091 --> 18:30.924
would benefit
from a fracking ban

18:30.926 --> 18:32.626
because it would drive
Russian oil prices back up.

18:32.628 --> 18:34.161
I don't think they're involved.

18:41.003 --> 18:42.769
This is Agent Hotchner.

18:42.771 --> 18:43.970
We have Sophie Troy.

18:43.972 --> 18:44.972
Who is this?

18:44.973 --> 18:46.106
You may call me Viktor.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.508
Viktor, we need to know
that Sophie is alive.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.178
Hello?

18:51.180 --> 18:53.513
Sophie, this is Agent
Hotchner with the FBI.

18:53.515 --> 18:54.748
I'm here with your husband.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.750
Ben?

18:55.751 --> 18:57.517
Sophie, are you ok?

18:57.519 --> 18:59.519
I...think so.

18:59.521 --> 19:02.189
Ask her something personal.

19:02.191 --> 19:04.524
Uh, Sophie, you remember
our first date.

19:04.526 --> 19:07.327
Where did we go
after dinner?

19:07.329 --> 19:10.497
We went for a walk.

19:10.499 --> 19:11.832
Where?

19:11.834 --> 19:14.868
Where did we go for a walk?
What was the name of the park?

19:14.870 --> 19:17.838
You have to help me.
I think they're gonna kill me--

19:17.840 --> 19:19.072
No, wait. Put her
back on the phone.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.807
You didn't let her
answer the question.

19:20.809 --> 19:21.908
I can't tell
that it's her.

19:21.910 --> 19:22.876
Viktor...

19:22.878 --> 19:24.077
Satisfied?
Sophie--

19:24.079 --> 19:27.080
Tell the Congressman
we're not children.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.182
He and his family
think to take advantage,

19:29.184 --> 19:32.486
but we won't be paid off
with some pocket change.

19:32.488 --> 19:34.521
Viktor?

19:34.523 --> 19:36.823
We get a trace?

19:36.825 --> 19:38.992
It's a long number.
Overseas.

19:38.994 --> 19:40.160
Chechnya.

19:40.162 --> 19:42.395
No, there's no way
he would take her that far.

19:42.397 --> 19:43.864
He rerouted the call.

19:43.866 --> 19:46.266
Rock Creek Park.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.636
We went to Rock Creek
Park on our date.

19:49.638 --> 19:53.206
That was her, all right.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.909
It had to be her.

19:55.911 --> 19:57.911
“Tell the Congressman
we're not children.

19:57.913 --> 20:00.580
“He and his family
think to take advantage,

20:00.582 --> 20:03.884
but we won't be paid off
with some pocket change.”

20:03.886 --> 20:06.887
“Paid off with
some pocket change.”

20:06.889 --> 20:09.856
Maybe there was some
prior arrangement.

20:09.858 --> 20:12.459
We know from Spence
that the ransom amount change.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.528
Maybe a previous deal
went south?

20:14.530 --> 20:16.863
Meaning the Congressman
or someone in his circle

20:16.865 --> 20:18.131
is hiding something.

20:18.133 --> 20:21.168
It could be an inside job.
Are we being played here?

20:21.170 --> 20:23.804
Viktor did say
he and his family.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.405
Maybe it's the brother,
Paul.

20:25.407 --> 20:27.474
The born again
soup kitchen volunteer?

20:27.476 --> 20:30.510
Who was a pill-popping
drug addict 3 months ago.

20:30.512 --> 20:32.612
Well, he's definitely uncomfortable
around the Congressman,

20:32.614 --> 20:34.581
and he avoids
making eye contact.

20:35.684 --> 20:38.385
Hey, baby girl, what do you know
about Paul Troy?

20:39.721 --> 20:42.222
Garcia.

20:42.224 --> 20:44.424
Hey, baby gir--

20:57.606 --> 20:59.706
Oh, my God. What are you
doing in here?

20:59.708 --> 21:02.008
I was looking for you.
It's very messy.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.276
Ok, chill, chill.
You know I'm not worried

21:03.278 --> 21:04.411
about how you keep
the Batcave.

21:04.413 --> 21:07.113
You're here for information
about Paul Troy.

21:07.115 --> 21:10.217
He was arrested
6 months ago for embezzlement

21:10.219 --> 21:13.787
while he was working
as a manager for a restaurant,

21:13.789 --> 21:15.922
but the charges were dropped.
According to police records,

21:15.924 --> 21:18.859
he needed the money
to pay back Russian drug dealers,

21:18.861 --> 21:21.394
but he had every intention
of paying the restaurant back.

21:21.396 --> 21:22.729
You are the best.
Uh-huh.

21:22.731 --> 21:25.966
Thanks, mama.
Yeah.

21:25.968 --> 21:28.235
We know at the time
of your arrest

21:28.237 --> 21:31.838
you owed some Russian
drug dealers money. How much?

21:31.840 --> 21:33.707
32,000.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.475
Well, you must have
paid it off, otherwise

21:35.477 --> 21:37.444
you'd be dead or laid up
in a hospital somewhere.

21:37.446 --> 21:39.446
I got a loan.

21:39.448 --> 21:40.448
From who?

21:40.449 --> 21:41.648
A friend.

21:41.650 --> 21:42.782
Your brother?

21:42.784 --> 21:44.184
No, I said a friend.

21:44.186 --> 21:45.485
Which friend?

21:45.487 --> 21:46.786
Look, I don't want him
involved in this.

21:46.788 --> 21:49.189
That's not your call right now.
I need a name.

21:53.262 --> 21:55.962
Where were you yesterday
at 2:30 p.m.?

21:57.666 --> 21:59.766
Ok. Here's another scenario.

21:59.768 --> 22:01.234
You still owe
the drug dealers,

22:01.236 --> 22:03.503
but you told them how to get
a much bigger payday.

22:03.505 --> 22:05.038
They kidnap
your sister-in-law,

22:05.040 --> 22:07.340
your family will pay the ransom,
no questions asked.

22:07.342 --> 22:08.975
Look, that's insane.

22:08.977 --> 22:11.378
Then where were you
yesterday?

22:16.618 --> 22:21.221
Has Paul been acting
unusual lately?

22:21.223 --> 22:23.056
Behaving erratically?

22:23.058 --> 22:26.459
No. That's what he was like
when he was on drugs.

22:26.461 --> 22:29.396
These last two months,
he's been an angel.

22:29.398 --> 22:31.865
It's like having
my little boy back.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.934
Is he jealous
of his brother?

22:33.936 --> 22:36.636
My sons love each other.

22:36.638 --> 22:39.539
Well, yeah, sure,
but is he jealous?

22:39.541 --> 22:41.308
I mean, I know
I would be.

22:41.310 --> 22:44.010
My brother's handsome,
successful,

22:44.012 --> 22:45.679
married to
a gorgeous woman,

22:45.681 --> 22:48.415
and I can't even
hold down a job.

22:49.518 --> 22:52.585
You want me to speak ill
of Paul.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.855
I won't.

22:55.857 --> 22:58.458
He's had a hard life.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.828
You know how he got
that scar on his face?

23:01.830 --> 23:05.699
A neighbor poured a pot
of hot oil out of her kitchen window.

23:05.701 --> 23:09.569
Didn't know Paul was playing
with her cat underneath.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.173
He was 5.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.315
Yesterday I was with
my friend Toby.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.851
Toby. He give you the loan?

23:24.853 --> 23:26.419
No.

23:26.421 --> 23:27.654
Toby's an escort.

23:27.656 --> 23:31.358
So who paid off
the drug dealers?

23:32.894 --> 23:34.327
It was Ben.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.229
All right?
It was my brother.

23:36.231 --> 23:38.331
You were right all along.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.034
Why so reluctant
to say it?

23:41.036 --> 23:43.803
Were you embarrassed
he had to bail you out yet again?

23:43.805 --> 23:45.705
He didn't bail--

23:45.707 --> 23:49.275
you think he's such
a Saint, don't you?

23:49.277 --> 23:52.579
He's got you all fooled,
doesn't he?

23:52.581 --> 23:56.249
The golden boy
with his perfect face.

23:56.251 --> 23:57.851
So why'd he pay?

23:59.488 --> 24:02.155
You really want to know?

24:02.157 --> 24:05.925
To shut me up about the
intern he's been screwing.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.633
JJ, Hotch needs to see us.

24:13.635 --> 24:16.636
Garcia found the actual origination
point of the kidnapper's phone call.

24:16.638 --> 24:19.672
Yes. It's an unleased
warehouse near Rock Creek Park,

24:19.674 --> 24:22.108
address is on your phone.
Good luck.

24:48.637 --> 24:51.004
Clear!

24:51.907 --> 24:54.107
Clear.

24:54.109 --> 24:56.242
Clear.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.589
What is that?
What are they doing?

25:09.591 --> 25:13.626
Making sure
it's not an I.E.D.

25:19.801 --> 25:20.801
Those are Sophie's.

25:20.802 --> 25:23.069
I bought them
for our anniversary.

25:26.708 --> 25:28.608
Oh--oh, God.

25:38.619 --> 25:41.689
I am magnificent, no doubt,
but this is too easy.

25:41.690 --> 25:43.523
They used a dozen layers
of cover

25:43.525 --> 25:45.158
when they could have
used thousands.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.693
They wanted us to find them.

25:46.695 --> 25:48.061
No witnesses saw anyone

25:48.063 --> 25:49.830
leaving the warehouse.
Or at least they're not talking,

25:49.832 --> 25:51.098
not that I blame them.

25:51.100 --> 25:53.266
I'm worried, Aaron.
We got 4 hours until the deadline

25:53.268 --> 25:55.435
and no line of communication
to the kidnappers.

25:55.437 --> 25:57.003
Whatever the Congressman's
involvement,

25:57.005 --> 25:59.139
the clock's ticking
on Sophie.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.774
Who's that?

26:02.778 --> 26:05.445
The Congressman's intern.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.649
Thank you. I can't tell you
how much it means to me.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.118
Take care.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.086
I feel like I should be
holding a telethon

26:13.088 --> 26:15.989
the way I'm asking strangers
to donate money for Sophie's ransom.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.357
Have a seat, Congressman.
We need to ask you

26:17.359 --> 26:19.960
about an intern in your office,
Michelle Golovin.

26:22.131 --> 26:23.597
A former intern.

26:23.599 --> 26:25.132
She no longer
works for you?

26:25.134 --> 26:26.767
Not for more
than a year now.

26:26.769 --> 26:29.369
Have the kidnappers
called back yet?

26:29.371 --> 26:31.338
Did you two
stay in touch?

26:32.341 --> 26:34.341
Maybe. I don't--
I don't remember.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.976
A phone call or two
at the most.

26:35.978 --> 26:38.678
Actually, it was
a little more than that.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.014
29 calls in the last
month alone,

26:41.016 --> 26:43.150
according to the phone
records we pulled.

26:43.152 --> 26:44.751
Ok. I can explain that.

26:44.753 --> 26:47.120
Good. Because we were wondering
whether you and Michelle

26:47.122 --> 26:50.090
had planned
the kidnapping together.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.327
He came over last night
around 8:30.

26:54.329 --> 26:57.164
He said his wife was at
some stupid board meeting.

26:57.166 --> 26:58.365
What did you do?

26:58.367 --> 27:01.735
We...made love.

27:03.038 --> 27:06.506
But he did seem more
nervous than usual.

27:06.508 --> 27:08.708
Yes, I had a relationship
with her.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.744
While Michelle
was still your intern.

27:10.746 --> 27:13.046
Again, mea culpa.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.016
But I was single,
we were both consenting adults,

27:16.018 --> 27:17.684
and this was before
I met Sophie.

27:17.686 --> 27:21.855
Believe me, after that
I wasn't interested in anyone else.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.990
He told me
we'd be together soon.

27:23.992 --> 27:26.860
He doesn't love Sophie,
you know.

27:26.862 --> 27:30.363
He only married her
for his career.

27:32.701 --> 27:35.035
Did he try to end things
with you?

27:35.037 --> 27:37.270
I broke it off with her
the day after I met Sophie.

27:37.272 --> 27:39.272
And how did she take it?

27:40.442 --> 27:42.042
Not well.

27:42.044 --> 27:43.710
She was very angry.

27:43.712 --> 27:46.746
She was upset. She started
to threaten suicide

27:46.748 --> 27:49.349
if I didn't call her
or visit her regularly.

27:49.351 --> 27:51.585
Visit her to have sex?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.386
We made love
whenever he came over.

27:53.388 --> 27:56.256
And he kept all of this
a secret from Sophie?

27:56.258 --> 27:57.724
Yes.

27:57.726 --> 27:59.159
Maybe I should have
told Sophie.

27:59.161 --> 28:01.461
I was just talking
to Michelle to calm her down.

28:01.463 --> 28:03.163
It wasn't like we were
still sleeping together.

28:03.165 --> 28:05.031
Why did you go see her
last night?

28:05.033 --> 28:09.369
Because she threatened to swallow
a bottle of painkillers if I didn't.

28:19.348 --> 28:22.482
Ah, where the hell
have you been?

28:22.484 --> 28:24.150
I went to the store.

28:24.152 --> 28:26.486
You needed more detergent.

28:26.488 --> 28:29.422
Well, you better start
cleaning more.

28:29.424 --> 28:31.358
I've been doing it.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.861
This place is a pigsty.

28:34.863 --> 28:37.998
What are we paying you for?

28:39.334 --> 28:42.602
You smell like something.
What is it?

28:42.604 --> 28:43.570
Bleach probably.

28:43.572 --> 28:46.039
No, no, it's more like
perfumy.

28:46.041 --> 28:48.475
It's like the woods
or flowers or something.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.743
Please--

28:49.745 --> 28:51.411
But is good. I like.
Come, come and dance with me.

28:51.413 --> 28:53.446
Stop it, please!

28:55.918 --> 28:56.918
Come on.

28:56.919 --> 28:57.884
Leave me alone!

28:57.886 --> 29:00.053
You've been teasing me
for months.

29:00.055 --> 29:03.123
You little bitch.
You think you're too good for me?

29:03.125 --> 29:04.557
We should do something.
We can't.

29:04.559 --> 29:05.625
He's beating her up.

29:05.627 --> 29:07.127
You bust in there,
you blow the entire case.

29:07.129 --> 29:09.262
Yours and mine.
Think of the big picture.

29:09.264 --> 29:10.797
You want to kill
Sophie Troy,

29:10.799 --> 29:13.633
or thousands of people
if the missile shipment gets out?

29:15.037 --> 29:16.503
Uhh!

29:17.773 --> 29:19.105
What's going on?

29:19.107 --> 29:20.140
Nothing.

29:20.142 --> 29:22.309
She was getting smart
with me,

29:22.311 --> 29:26.513
but, uh, she learned
her lesson. Go.

29:26.515 --> 29:29.716
Go! Clean yourself up.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.352
Well?

29:32.354 --> 29:35.689
You're right. Dyadya's
getting 20 million.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.427
Right now it's
“he said, she said.”

29:40.429 --> 29:41.828
Well, the Congressman
didn't get where he is

29:41.830 --> 29:44.030
without having some skill
manipulating the truth.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.333
Well, the threat of suicide,
especially after a break-up,

29:46.335 --> 29:47.667
if definitely a possibility.

29:47.669 --> 29:49.169
I mean, I saw it happen
with a friend of mine

29:49.171 --> 29:50.537
and his ex
back in the day.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.972
I found a smoking gun.

29:51.974 --> 29:53.773
Or at least the stuff that goes
into the gun to make it smoke.

29:53.775 --> 29:55.342
Credit card receipts
from the Congressman

29:55.344 --> 29:57.677
show he purchased ammo
for a handgun.

29:57.679 --> 29:59.512
And then more smoke--
he sent that ammo

29:59.514 --> 30:02.782
to a P.O. box registered
in his name in Virginia.

30:02.784 --> 30:05.285
Now, why
would he do that?

30:08.190 --> 30:10.223
Did you have your wife
kidnapped?

30:10.225 --> 30:11.191
What?

30:11.193 --> 30:13.059
No, what?
Why are you saying this?

30:13.061 --> 30:15.261
You purchased ammunition
for a handgun last month,

30:15.263 --> 30:16.830
and you had it shipped
to a mailbox in Virginia.

30:16.832 --> 30:18.932
Which means you likely
own a handgun,

30:18.934 --> 30:20.700
although there isn't one
registered to your name.

30:20.702 --> 30:21.735
Yes, I have a handgun.

30:21.737 --> 30:22.836
Which you bought illegally?

30:22.838 --> 30:25.405
Well, I had to
after being so staunchly

30:25.407 --> 30:26.673
pro gun control.

30:26.675 --> 30:28.508
You bought the gun with the intent
to murder your wife,

30:28.510 --> 30:31.544
and then you changed your plans and
arranged to have her kidnapped instead.

30:31.546 --> 30:32.712
No, I bought the gun
because I was--

30:32.714 --> 30:35.682
because I am--
terrified of Michelle.

30:35.684 --> 30:38.418
You know, just a couple months ago
she threatened to come to my home

30:38.420 --> 30:40.053
to tell Sophie that
we were having an affair

30:40.055 --> 30:43.790
and then she was gonna kill
both of us in front of her.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.992
He's scared of me?

30:46.895 --> 30:48.828
He's lying.

30:48.830 --> 30:51.431
He'll say anything
to save his ass right now.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.300
Those are interesting words
to say about the man you love.

30:54.302 --> 30:57.037
I love him. But I also know
his weaknesses.

30:57.039 --> 30:59.873
He's selfish.
He thinks about himself first.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.142
Like I have to be available for him
whenever he wants.

31:02.144 --> 31:03.710
Ohh, I know the type.

31:03.712 --> 31:06.212
Probably won't even use
protection, right?

31:06.214 --> 31:07.714
Are you kidding?

31:07.716 --> 31:09.783
That's my responsibility.

31:09.785 --> 31:13.086
Look, despite what
the Congressman is saying,

31:13.088 --> 31:15.221
I just want you to know
that I believe you.

31:15.223 --> 31:17.390
And if you'll agree
to take a medical exam,

31:17.392 --> 31:20.693
we can prove that he had
unprotected sex with you last night

31:20.695 --> 31:23.463
and is just lying
to save himself.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.970
Now you're looking at me
like I'm dirt.

31:33.108 --> 31:36.309
I'm just another scumbag
politician, right?

31:36.311 --> 31:40.947
I mean, I must be some sort
of a depraved narcissist to do what I do.

31:40.949 --> 31:43.516
Maybe I am.

31:43.518 --> 31:45.985
Maybe I am.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.989
It doesn't mean
I would hurt my wife.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.724
I love Sophie.

31:51.726 --> 31:53.793
So...

31:53.795 --> 31:56.996
I don't care about my reputation anymore,
all right?

31:56.998 --> 31:59.532
Go ahead, smear my name if
that's what you want to do.

31:59.534 --> 32:01.634
I don't care.

32:01.636 --> 32:03.703
Just find her.

32:14.216 --> 32:16.216
Hello.

32:16.218 --> 32:19.686
No, he can't talk right now.
He's in the bathroom.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.555
Who's this?

32:22.557 --> 32:25.258
Ah, you're Dyadya.

32:25.260 --> 32:27.961
No, I didn't know.

32:29.231 --> 32:31.297
Uh-huh.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.668
Yeah. I'll tell him.

32:37.506 --> 32:38.538
Dyadya just called.

32:38.540 --> 32:39.540
Oh, yeah?

32:39.541 --> 32:41.207
What did he say?

32:41.209 --> 32:43.176
He said he left
two messages.

32:43.178 --> 32:45.678
Wants to know why you haven't
called him back yet.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.713
I didn't get them.

32:46.715 --> 32:50.150
Or maybe you did
and just didn't tell me?

32:50.152 --> 32:53.987
Seriously?
Come on, now, you drunk.

32:53.989 --> 32:56.756
Roman, it's me.

32:58.126 --> 33:00.560
He wants us to meet him
in an hour with a truck.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.028
We're supposed to bring
ski masks.

33:02.030 --> 33:03.196
All right, let's go.

33:04.432 --> 33:05.865
What the hell?

33:05.867 --> 33:08.001
Are you spying on us?

33:08.003 --> 33:11.137
Why are you hiding
in the closet?

33:11.139 --> 33:13.106
This isn't good.

33:15.710 --> 33:18.344
She's categorically
refusing a medical exam.

33:18.346 --> 33:21.247
Which means the Congressman
is probably telling the truth

33:21.249 --> 33:23.183
about the affair
being over.

33:23.185 --> 33:24.684
But it still doesn't
exonerate him.

33:24.686 --> 33:26.519
He bought a gun because
he was terrified of her,

33:26.521 --> 33:28.588
and yet he went to visit her
the day his wife went missing.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.723
Maybe Sophie found out
about them and tried to expose him.

33:30.725 --> 33:31.758
The problem is,

33:31.760 --> 33:33.626
if he's not behind
the kidnapping,

33:33.628 --> 33:35.595
we don't have
any other leads, an it's...

33:35.597 --> 33:37.730
A little over a hour

33:37.732 --> 33:39.032
till the deadline.

33:39.034 --> 33:40.633
And we don't have any way
to contact the kidnappers.

33:40.635 --> 33:43.102
Maybe we do.

33:44.806 --> 33:45.905
How long
you been in there, huh?

33:45.907 --> 33:47.173
What did you hear?

33:47.175 --> 33:50.009
Nothing, I swear.

33:50.011 --> 33:51.511
Who do you work for?

33:51.513 --> 33:53.146
I think they're just messing with her.
They won't hurt her.

33:53.148 --> 33:54.314
We don't know that.

33:55.317 --> 33:56.616
Who is it?

33:56.618 --> 33:57.850
Rossi, hold on.

33:57.852 --> 33:59.152
Can't. Clock's ticking

33:59.154 --> 34:00.954
and you've got our best
lead on the kidnappers.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.255
There's no one.

34:02.257 --> 34:03.656
You're a lying bitch.

34:03.658 --> 34:05.692
It's the damn feds,
isn't it?

34:05.694 --> 34:07.927
She has to die.

34:09.331 --> 34:10.830
Oh, please, don't!

34:10.831 --> 34:12.197
Reid, are you there?

34:18.313 --> 34:19.868
Stop, stop. Listen.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.853
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

34:21.855 --> 34:22.954
Reid, what's going on?

34:22.956 --> 34:24.822
It's more complicated
than we thought.

34:24.824 --> 34:26.704
You go in there and arrest
those guys right now.

34:26.793 --> 34:28.360
Roman's dead.
Just wait a minute.

34:28.362 --> 34:30.161
I should have
killed him sooner, sweetheart.

34:30.163 --> 34:32.263
Are they...

34:32.264 --> 34:34.299
Yeah, I think so.

34:34.301 --> 34:36.501
Get your things.
We're leaving.

34:36.503 --> 34:38.570
What about Dyadya?

34:38.572 --> 34:42.107
His contact is pissed
that he asked for more ransom,

34:42.109 --> 34:44.476
but she'll pay
if the wife is dead.

34:44.478 --> 34:47.445
We're supposed to pick up
the body and dump it.

34:47.447 --> 34:50.148
But listen to me.

34:50.150 --> 34:53.918
We don't have to do
any of this.

34:53.920 --> 34:58.356
We can take the money,
or we can run away.

34:58.358 --> 35:01.159
Rossi, the unsub's a woman. I don't
think we should arrest anyone yet.

35:01.161 --> 35:03.561
They're leaving now.
They might lead us to Sophie.

35:05.198 --> 35:07.432
Reid said the unsub's
a female.

35:07.434 --> 35:09.167
Could be someone close
to the Congressman.

35:09.169 --> 35:12.003
Michelle doesn't have
the sophistication to pull it off.

35:12.005 --> 35:14.339
Since he fired her,
all of his staffers have been male.

35:14.341 --> 35:17.008
The Congressman said
something odd about his mother.

35:17.010 --> 35:20.445
I saw him earlier and he said
his mother would say

35:20.447 --> 35:24.916
that Sophie was abducted because
<i>he</i> wasn't a gentleman.

35:24.918 --> 35:25.884
That's harsh.

35:25.886 --> 35:27.719
Her opinion means
a lot to him,

35:27.721 --> 35:29.120
or maybe he's scared
of her?

35:29.122 --> 35:30.488
It could be both.

35:30.490 --> 35:33.558
What if this is like
“The Manchurian Candidate”?

35:34.060 --> 35:36.427
A domineering mother
molds her candidate son

35:36.429 --> 35:39.163
into an unwitting assassin.

35:40.066 --> 35:42.633
I ask myself
that same question.

35:42.635 --> 35:45.002
I mean, where did Benjy
come from?

35:45.004 --> 35:46.804
I know I gave birth to him.

35:46.806 --> 35:48.606
I remember the 20 hours
of labor.

35:48.608 --> 35:49.608
But the rest--

35:49.609 --> 35:51.776
it's--it's a cosmic gift.

35:51.778 --> 35:54.111
I mean, where did Mozart
come from?

35:54.113 --> 35:55.346
Or Einstein or--

35:55.348 --> 35:57.615
Ok, let's drop
the earth mother act.

35:57.617 --> 35:59.550
You went to Vassar,
and you were voted

35:59.552 --> 36:01.686
most likely to run
a Fortune 500 company,

36:01.688 --> 36:04.255
yet you never had
a career after college.

36:04.257 --> 36:06.691
I chose to stay home
and raise my children.

36:06.693 --> 36:08.726
You have a problem
with that?

36:08.728 --> 36:10.962
No, but it makes me wonder
what happened to all that ambition.

36:10.964 --> 36:12.129
It had to go somewhere.

36:12.131 --> 36:14.398
I think you channeled it
into your sons.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.668
Especially Benjamin, after your
older son had his accident.

36:17.670 --> 36:19.637
You were smart enough
to stay in the background,

36:19.639 --> 36:21.505
but you guided
Benjamin's career.

36:21.507 --> 36:25.042
Who knew the FBI had such
active imaginations?

36:25.044 --> 36:27.211
What happened?
Did Benjamin step out of line?

36:27.213 --> 36:29.714
Did he marry someone
you didn't approve of?

36:29.716 --> 36:32.316
Ben fell head over heels
in love.

36:32.318 --> 36:34.085
He met and married Sophie
within a year.

36:34.087 --> 36:35.987
Now, that's awfully fast.

36:35.989 --> 36:38.189
I can't imagine
you had a chance

36:38.191 --> 36:40.024
to properly vet
and train her,

36:40.026 --> 36:42.727
so the solution was
to get rid of her.

36:42.729 --> 36:44.295
That's ridiculous.

36:44.297 --> 36:45.629
You seemed genuinely
surprised

36:45.631 --> 36:48.332
when you heard the ransom
amount was $20 million.

36:48.334 --> 36:49.600
Why is that?

36:49.602 --> 36:52.203
Well, it's an awful lot,
don't you think?

36:52.205 --> 36:54.138
A lot more than two.

36:54.140 --> 36:56.574
That was supposed to be
their fee

36:56.576 --> 36:58.109
for getting rid of Sophie,

36:58.111 --> 37:00.511
but they changed
the terms on you.

37:00.513 --> 37:03.214
They heard about Benjamin's
campaign war chest

37:03.216 --> 37:05.516
and thought they were
being underpaid.

37:05.518 --> 37:07.485
That is pure conjecture.

37:07.487 --> 37:09.587
His approval rates
were waning.

37:09.589 --> 37:12.423
Something like this
would create sympathy,

37:12.425 --> 37:14.358
boost his visibility.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.629
Maybe this wasn't about
your disliking Sophie.

37:18.631 --> 37:22.366
This is just you being
ruthlessly pragmatic.

37:22.368 --> 37:24.869
Here's what's gonna happen.

37:24.871 --> 37:27.104
We're gonna charge Benjamin
with weapons possession

37:27.106 --> 37:29.073
and with the intent
to murder his wife.

37:29.075 --> 37:32.710
This is not just
a minor sex scandal.

37:32.712 --> 37:36.280
His career will be destroyed,

37:36.282 --> 37:38.649
and all your hard work
grooming him

37:38.651 --> 37:40.518
will go down the drain.

37:41.654 --> 37:46.757
Unless you want to call
the kidnappers and end this now.

38:06.512 --> 38:07.545
FBI!
FBI!

38:07.547 --> 38:08.979
Hands in the air!

38:18.925 --> 38:20.558
She's alive.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.993
Oh, thank God.

38:40.813 --> 38:43.514
Is there something
you want to say to your wife?

38:43.516 --> 38:44.548
Yes.

38:44.550 --> 38:49.587
Sophie, you're
my entire world.

38:49.589 --> 38:52.256
And I want you to fight

38:52.258 --> 38:54.125
and don't give up.

38:55.761 --> 38:59.130
I want you
to come back to me.

38:59.132 --> 39:00.965
Oh...

39:00.967 --> 39:02.133
I can't.

39:02.135 --> 39:04.502
That was the Congressman
speaking to me

39:04.504 --> 39:06.337
in an exclusive interview
yesterday afternoon,

39:06.339 --> 39:09.106
and this was him
an hour ago.

39:09.108 --> 39:11.408
I would like to extend
my heartfelt thanks

39:11.410 --> 39:15.312
to the FBI,
in particular the BAU,

39:15.314 --> 39:18.182
for bringing my Sophie
back to me.

39:19.685 --> 39:25.289
I am and I will be
eternally grateful.

39:25.291 --> 39:27.358
Call me a softie,
but this whole thing

39:27.360 --> 39:28.726
is turning me into mush.

39:28.728 --> 39:30.461
You know, according to
online polls,

39:30.463 --> 39:33.130
his approval ratings
are skyrocketing.

39:33.132 --> 39:36.967
We may be looking at a future President
of the United States.

39:36.969 --> 39:38.235
He is a tall drink of water.

39:38.237 --> 39:40.871
Speaking of pretty boys,

39:40.873 --> 39:42.640
where's Reid?

39:44.810 --> 39:45.876
That should do it.

39:45.878 --> 39:48.078
Hey, thanks for coming
back to clean up.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.346
You didn't have to.

39:49.348 --> 39:50.714
No worries. I, um,

39:50.716 --> 39:53.717
I wanted to apologize
for almost rushing in there

39:53.719 --> 39:55.920
to save the wrong girl,
as it turns out.

39:55.922 --> 39:57.521
You could have been right.

39:57.523 --> 40:00.758
One of the hardest things
about surveillance is not taking action.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.560
You listen, you analyze,

40:02.562 --> 40:05.029
and then you force yourself
to do nothing.

40:05.031 --> 40:06.497
I imagine that's really hard.

40:06.499 --> 40:09.567
Oh, and sorry also about ruining
“Great Expectations” for you.

40:09.569 --> 40:11.001
You just saved me
about 20 hours.

40:11.003 --> 40:14.104
Maybe you can summarize
“Bleak House” for me, too.

40:56.882 --> 41:00.050
Everyone said it was
a mistake to visit you.

41:01.854 --> 41:06.824
I'm your mother,
and I raised a good son, didn't I?

41:10.896 --> 41:13.931
What you did to Sophie
was unforgivable.

41:13.933 --> 41:16.567
I'm sorry, Benjy.

41:24.076 --> 41:26.010
But it worked.

41:30.283 --> 41:32.182
Now what do I do?

41:32.184 --> 41:37.788
♪ Cold lies the snow ♪

41:38.891 --> 41:46.297
