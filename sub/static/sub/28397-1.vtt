03:30.911 --> 03:33.246
Ladies and Gentleman
of St. Anthony's Parish,

03:33.247 --> 03:36.349
many of you may remember
the Sullivan family,

03:36.350 --> 03:39.285
who were a part of our
flock for many years.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.854
Well, today we'd
like to welcome back

03:41.855 --> 03:45.491
Daniel Sullivan from
St. Patrick's Seminary,

03:45.492 --> 03:48.228
whom Bishop Byrnes has

03:48.229 --> 03:52.265
graciously sent us to support
Father Rob and our parish

03:52.266 --> 03:54.766
during this challenging time.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.403
Father?

04:00.341 --> 04:01.374
Yeah.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.375
Thank you.

04:04.945 --> 04:08.881
I have a very distinct
memory of the reception

04:08.882 --> 04:11.918
after Daniel's first communion,

04:11.919 --> 04:14.454
when water started flooding out

04:14.455 --> 04:17.390
from under the bathroom
door, right back there.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.427
I went in to find
Jacob, Christopher

04:23.297 --> 04:25.898
and Danny, plunger in hand,

04:25.899 --> 04:29.402
all with great, guilty
looks on their faces.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.972
I would never have guessed

04:32.973 --> 04:35.742
that any of those rascals

04:35.743 --> 04:38.411
would still remember
the Hail Mary

04:38.412 --> 04:41.014
by the time they were
old enough to drive.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.549
So, to me,

04:44.752 --> 04:47.987
this is nothing
short of a miracle

04:47.988 --> 04:51.624
to have one of them
return to our flock

04:51.625 --> 04:53.625
as a fellow clergyman.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.995
Who knows?

04:55.996 --> 04:58.931
Maybe he'll even back to stay.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.334
So let's give him
a warm welcome.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.407
So you excited
to be back then?

05:07.408 --> 05:08.841
Oh, thank you.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.343
Well, to tell you the truth,

05:11.344 --> 05:13.846
I was gonna go on a mission
trip to Haiti in the spring

05:13.847 --> 05:15.315
before my ordination.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.450
So, I wasn't planning on...

05:17.451 --> 05:18.718
10 degree weather?

05:18.719 --> 05:21.321
Where's this
other Sullivan boy?

05:21.322 --> 05:22.621
Father Rob says
we're lucky to have

05:22.622 --> 05:23.923
"another Sullivan boy back."

05:23.924 --> 05:25.858
Danny, Bart Sheraski.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.728
One of our biggest
local job creators.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.229
Owns the river mill.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.731
Just a little family company.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.866
Nice to meet
you, Mr. Sheraski.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.601
Dan's brother,
Chris, lives in town.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.736
Jake is the one.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.969
Oh, Christ.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.506
Sorry.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.507
Jake.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.109
What's Jake up to?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.446
I really have no idea.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.416
Shouldn't he be
here to welcome you?

05:50.417 --> 05:52.952
We don't keep in touch.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.888
Well, you've had your nose
in the books though, right?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.411
The guy's working...

05:57.412 --> 05:58.934
Young Daniel tells me

05:58.935 --> 06:00.460
he hasn't seen his
brother, Jake, in years.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.928
It's odd for a clergyman

06:01.929 --> 06:04.564
to be cut out from
his family, isn't it?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.766
Well, I'm sure
he's looking forward

06:06.767 --> 06:09.035
to seeing him again very soon.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.972
Sure, if I have time before
I go back to Milwaukee.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.741
Head back.

06:14.742 --> 06:18.077
And you're not
ordained yet, are you?

06:18.078 --> 06:20.796
Sorry, I thought you said that...

06:20.797 --> 06:23.515
So, Father Rob and I
are hoping that once...

06:25.969 --> 06:27.420
I think she's
pitching them the dream.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.555
You know, hometown
hero comes back.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.392
Prodigal son, all that stuff.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.594
She's been working
Sheraski for like a year.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.395
Some big endowment.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.398
I see.

06:38.399 --> 06:43.568
Do you have any idea what
Jake is up to nowadays?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.973
Saw him at the bait
shop a couple months ago.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.741
Haven't seen him
in church in ages

06:48.742 --> 06:51.677
but if you find him,
tell him I said hi.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.780
He was a good student.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.514
Both of them were.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.917
Thank you, Mr. Marx.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.184
Call me Tom.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.479
The number you have dialed

07:43.480 --> 07:45.932
has been changed, disconnected
or is no longer in service.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.534
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

07:48.535 --> 07:49.868
please hang up.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.891
Excuse me.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.228
Do you know where
Father Rob's room is?

09:30.704 --> 09:31.571
Take that.

09:31.572 --> 09:32.572
Nah.

09:33.307 --> 09:36.576
Oh and just start with half.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.710
Those are pretty strong.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.351
See you later, Grandma.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.752
She's not your grandma.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.039
Oh, Danny.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.611
I thought maybe you should
stick to the liturgical stuff.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.280
But if you want, I'd
love to have you do more.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.282
You could do some readings.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.203
The Gospel.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.288
Then maybe after a few weeks,

10:22.289 --> 10:25.992
I'll have you do a communion
service on your own.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.993
Homily and everything.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.030
Father, I'm
flattered, thank you

10:31.031 --> 10:33.398
but I think I'd prefer not.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.304
What?

10:39.706 --> 10:41.640
I'm sorry, nothing.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.709
You'd prefer not?

10:46.313 --> 10:49.914
I'd prefer not to
get ahead of myself,

10:51.184 --> 10:52.184
I guess.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.956
Sorry, I got.

11:03.163 --> 11:07.432
Sally has a list of the
people you should visit.

11:08.935 --> 11:13.039
Try to see them on Saturdays
or Sundays if you can.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.205
No problem.

11:15.809 --> 11:20.112
Why do I get a sense
you don't wanna be here?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.113
Father,

11:23.383 --> 11:25.051
I don't

11:25.052 --> 11:27.118
really have people here

11:28.755 --> 11:31.290
since my folks left town.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.693
My friends grew up.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.826
And Jacob?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.997
What?

11:38.998 --> 11:41.701
You think you can just show
up here for a few weeks,

11:41.702 --> 11:44.837
light some candles,
dish out communion

11:44.838 --> 11:49.075
and then scoot on back
to Milwaukee by Easter?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.108
Oh, Daniel.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.015
When you commit to
a life in Christ,

11:56.016 --> 12:00.119
you surrender yourself to
powers beyond your control.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.787
Whatever God's reasons may be,

12:03.390 --> 12:04.923
you're here now

12:05.826 --> 12:08.026
and you must accept that.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.730
Now let us pray.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.868
Our Father,
Who art in heaven

12:15.869 --> 12:17.837
Hallowed be Thy Name.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.045
Oh!

13:14.327 --> 13:15.927
Danny?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.373
You look different.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.374
Thanks?

13:31.044 --> 13:34.213
Sorry, I can't believe
you're still here in town.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.381
No, neither can I.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.416
I mean, I left for awhile but.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.118
Put your leg up.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.967
Look, I'm gonna finish a blowout

13:54.968 --> 13:57.236
but if you can hang,
I'll give you a ride.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.103
Okay.

13:58.104 --> 13:58.971
Yeah?

13:58.972 --> 13:59.972
Okay.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.953
So that's your dream, then?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.121
Is to become a priest?

14:16.122 --> 14:18.090
And then a bishop

14:18.091 --> 14:19.624
and then the pope?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.427
Well, I want to

14:23.997 --> 14:27.266
help people overcome
their spiritual burdens

14:27.267 --> 14:29.567
through Christ's teachings.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.503
That's so cool.

14:32.906 --> 14:33.906
Thanks.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.978
A right on Maple.

14:39.979 --> 14:42.081
Let me do a little detour.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.282
Where are we?

14:43.283 --> 14:45.951
Most people in this town,

14:45.952 --> 14:50.088
they have such a narrow
view of what's possible.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.225
They don't really go too far.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.564
I bet you'll be bishop.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.366
Stick with it.

15:02.936 --> 15:07.506
<i>♪ Can't take it with you ♪</i>

15:07.507 --> 15:12.244
<i>♪ On the same street ♪</i>

15:12.245 --> 15:17.382
<i>♪ Can't take it with you ♪</i>

15:18.118 --> 15:19.618
This?

15:19.619 --> 15:20.619
Right now?

15:21.454 --> 15:22.454
Come on.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.923
Let's say hi.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.212
I'm gonna.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.346
I got to pee.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.741
Who brought those?

16:18.111 --> 16:19.577
He was popular.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.616
You still

16:24.617 --> 16:26.285
come here

16:26.286 --> 16:28.253
after six years?

16:28.254 --> 16:29.254
Seven.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.190
Yeah.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.159
He was my first.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.474
My horoscope told me

16:48.475 --> 16:52.177
that I was gonna receive
an unexpected visitor.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.178
Me?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.747
What's your sign?

16:58.418 --> 16:59.518
When's your birthday?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.320
May 2nd.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.688
So you're Taurus the bull.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.223
Stubborn, private.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.262
But dependable, trustworthy.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.101
What's his?

17:17.804 --> 17:18.804
Scorpio.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.207
Magnetic.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.444
Unpredictable.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.181
Makes sense.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.182
Middle child.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.216
Class clown.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.217
Maniac.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.687
Yeah.

17:35.688 --> 17:36.821
And yours?

17:37.791 --> 17:39.057
Aquarius.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.326
The Water Bearer.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.331
Charming,

17:46.332 --> 17:47.465
free-willed.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.835
Contradictory.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.638
Sounds about right.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.374
I really,

17:57.644 --> 17:59.377
I missed you guys.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.426
You seen Jake?

18:14.427 --> 18:15.360
Yeah.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.361
Where?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.197
Try his place.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.901
I don't...

18:22.902 --> 18:24.669
You don't know where he lives?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.605
So you guys don't...

18:27.606 --> 18:29.641
We're different people
than we used to be.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.778
No.

18:34.714 --> 18:38.249
You're just wearing
different costumes.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.655
Nettleton Road.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.326
Dirt driveway.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.528
Past the rusted-out
car in the ditch.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.828
Shit.

19:26.599 --> 19:27.599
Whoa.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.572
Motherfucker!

20:40.573 --> 20:42.223
Get up!

20:42.224 --> 20:43.875
Come over here, I got
a present for you!

20:43.876 --> 20:45.777
I'm all set.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.778
Thanks.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.663
What the hell are you doing?

21:04.664 --> 21:07.733
You disappear on us for a year.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.018
Mom doesn't even
know where you are

21:10.019 --> 21:12.304
and I got to find out where
you live from Chris' ex?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.571
I disappear?

21:14.907 --> 21:16.275
I never left.

21:16.276 --> 21:19.077
You're the one who ran away,

21:19.078 --> 21:21.879
so don't come in here with
your dick hanging out!

21:24.484 --> 21:26.550
I'm here for a month.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.238
Two, maybe.

21:30.239 --> 21:32.057
I'm doing stuff with the church.

21:32.058 --> 21:35.327
I'm not trying to get
in your face, man.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.861
I just need you to

21:38.631 --> 21:39.764
come to mass

21:40.566 --> 21:42.967
a couple times and just

21:45.672 --> 21:47.505
talk to people.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.341
They just need to see
that we're good guys

21:49.342 --> 21:52.444
and that the church
is in good hands.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.812
Whatever.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.448
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.317
Okay.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.484
No, I get it.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.718
It's like I'm,

22:03.723 --> 22:04.589
what do you call it?

22:04.590 --> 22:05.590
I'm like a

22:06.959 --> 22:08.426
a merit badge.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.898
Family's important.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.567
I don't wanna screw this up.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.968
I'm getting ordained in May.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.843
No shit.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.012
What do you say, Sunday?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.814
See you there?

22:28.815 --> 22:30.281
Not even a little foreplay

22:30.282 --> 22:31.750
before you bend
me over here, eh?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.352
Come on.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.353
Please.

22:34.354 --> 22:38.790
Maybe there's something
you'd like to pray for

22:39.759 --> 22:40.992
or ask forgiveness for.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.494
Jesus Christ.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.562
Stop saying that.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.631
Man, you are
completely brainwashed.

22:46.632 --> 22:47.699
I'm not brainwashed.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.102
You used to hate this shit.

22:50.103 --> 22:54.806
You even took communion home
with you from mass one time

22:54.807 --> 22:56.624
and you burned it.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.443
It's because it's different
when you're a kid, man.

22:58.444 --> 23:01.545
It's different when
you're not a kid.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.622
Sorry I bothered you.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.423
Forget it, I'll go.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.026
Hey.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.562
Danny!

23:23.069 --> 23:24.436
Just, will you just?

23:24.437 --> 23:26.605
All right, stay, come in.

23:26.606 --> 23:27.606
Or.

23:30.676 --> 23:31.809
Take a seat.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.505
You been playing?

24:00.506 --> 24:01.572
Most days.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.175
That and Mario Kart.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.986
Yeah, won't.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.888
Hey, will you just
put that down?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.690
Put it down.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.792
The strings are
a little brittle.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.193
Yeah, no shit.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.596
It's freezing in here.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.065
Out of fire wood.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.071
Speaking of which,

24:36.008 --> 24:38.142
what you up to tomorrow?

24:40.613 --> 24:42.213
Cutting firewood.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.025
What the?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.793
Lumberjack style.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.164
Come on.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.875
I could probably
get us a chainsaw.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.643
No chainsaws.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.777
Why?

25:12.778 --> 25:14.513
Too loud.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.181
The whole point of fire wood

25:16.182 --> 25:20.552
is so I don't have to give
money to fracking and shit.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.520
What about driving?

25:23.656 --> 25:25.789
It's a necessary evil.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.960
Here we go.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.762
Nah, this shit's rotten.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.763
Up here.

25:36.669 --> 25:37.935
Hey,

25:37.936 --> 25:39.204
do you remember the time

25:39.205 --> 25:41.622
we caught a garter snake

25:41.623 --> 25:44.042
and you stabbed it to
death with a screwdriver?

25:44.043 --> 25:47.579
And then you threw it
into the Thompsons' yard.

25:47.580 --> 25:48.679
Shit stank.

25:49.815 --> 25:50.948
Yeah, why?

25:52.218 --> 25:55.253
Or what about the
time you got in a fight

25:55.254 --> 25:57.955
on the bus with Randy Lipvak?

25:59.825 --> 26:03.027
But you were too
small to beat him up,

26:03.028 --> 26:06.230
so instead, you told him you
were glad his mom was dead.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.666
Yeah.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.236
You were a nasty
little bastard.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.879
I remember stuff
about you too.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.881
Oh yeah?

26:22.882 --> 26:23.948
Indulge me.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.053
Do you remember that time
when you were like seven

26:28.054 --> 26:31.189
and Dad sent Chris to
bed without any dinner

26:31.190 --> 26:33.024
and then you saved half
of yours in a napkin

26:33.025 --> 26:35.225
and brought it up to him?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.832
I think the sweetest
thing you ever did though

26:40.833 --> 26:42.734
was when you got the
entire 5th grad class

26:42.735 --> 26:45.303
to make Valentines for
people at the nursing home.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.739
I bet they were really touched.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.274
You ever go by their anymore?

26:49.275 --> 26:50.709
Oh yeah.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.242
Old chicks dig me.

26:56.816 --> 27:00.351
Well come on, tree's
not gonna cut itself.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.089
Dude.

27:04.090 --> 27:07.158
There's a reason this
shit is obsolete, man.

27:07.159 --> 27:10.028
They clear-cut the
whole country with this.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.163
We can cut this
little branch, here.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.865
Okay.

27:13.866 --> 27:14.866
Pull.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.169
Pull.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.679
Don't push, I'll pull.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.089
Fuck!

27:40.026 --> 27:41.058
Goddamn it.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.837
Well.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.340
If it isn't the future
Father Sullivan.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.842
Is that Chris, uh, Jacob?

27:57.843 --> 27:58.810
Yeah.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.011
Hi, Jake.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.379
Hi, Mr. Marx.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.248
This isn't bio class, fellas.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.684
Call me Tom, all right?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.535
What's up?

28:07.536 --> 28:09.387
Do you have a chainsaw
that we could barrow?

28:09.388 --> 28:11.122
Sure I do.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.257
I'll tell you what,

28:12.258 --> 28:13.825
make you a bargain.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.260
You boys come join Jeanne and I

28:15.261 --> 28:17.829
for brunch this
weekend after church,

28:17.830 --> 28:20.398
you can use the chainsaw
as much as you want.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.266
Sounds good to me.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.803
Jake?

28:24.804 --> 28:25.804
Sure.

28:26.839 --> 28:27.839
All right.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.840
Come on.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.913
Jake, you catch anything lately?

28:34.914 --> 28:37.848
Just a nasty
case of the crabs.

28:39.852 --> 28:42.053
You know what I mean.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.822
A few northern, some perch.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.457
I hear there's
some walleye biting too.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.124
Not by my spot.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.260
Where is that anyway?

28:53.933 --> 28:55.933
Good man.

29:33.922 --> 29:35.473
I left my math homework
at home but Mom's not there.

29:35.474 --> 29:36.441
I need the truck.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.986
No way.

29:37.987 --> 29:39.531
I'm going off campus.

29:39.532 --> 29:41.079
I need it by fifth
hour or I'm gonna get an F.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.815
Well, then you
should've remembered it.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.784
Find a ride with somebody else.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.067
What?

30:06.172 --> 30:07.172
Nothing.

30:07.173 --> 30:12.210
All right, well, I
got to get into town, so.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.244
Oh.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.444
So jam later?

30:16.015 --> 30:17.815
Yeah, maybe next time.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.656
So, yeah,

30:25.657 --> 30:26.890
I'll stop by or something.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.293
All right.

30:36.902 --> 30:37.969
It's been so long.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.203
Been awhile.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.842
Oh and hey,

30:43.843 --> 30:46.077
thanks for helping me out today.

30:46.078 --> 30:49.913
You know, you really
handle wood like a pro.

30:52.218 --> 30:55.253
<i>♪ Why do you hurt me so ♪</i>

30:55.254 --> 30:58.489
<i>♪ Leaving me so all alone ♪</i>

30:58.490 --> 31:02.360

31:27.553 --> 31:29.553
Everybody okay here?

31:31.290 --> 31:32.891
Yeah.

31:32.892 --> 31:34.358
I'm really sorry.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.564
Stay in the car,
keep your hands still!

31:39.565 --> 31:42.900
You have a license
and registration?

31:58.017 --> 32:00.485
Why don't you have a license?

32:00.486 --> 32:02.353
Well I don't normally drive.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.923
Oh, Daniel, that
does not bode well.

32:04.924 --> 32:08.359
I went to go see
Jake, like you asked.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.694
I didn't have a ride.

32:09.695 --> 32:13.064
Well you can always call me.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.167
How'd it go?

32:19.338 --> 32:20.338
Good.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.566
Anything else?

32:26.567 --> 32:28.523
Francis brought over
some music selections

32:28.524 --> 32:30.481
and Father Rob's notes
from the past three months.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.483
The congregational
feedback forms

32:32.484 --> 32:34.452
and next week's
music are on top.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.355
Please think about mass.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.090
Father Rob needs you.

32:39.091 --> 32:42.427
The impression you make
is gonna count for a lot.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.294
I will do my best.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.467
Father?

33:22.468 --> 33:23.468
It's time.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.003
Oh, fudge.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.743
I need to go.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.180
Get Francis,
we'll cancel mass.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.248
Water, water.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.249
No.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.184
No.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.186
Everyone's here.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.653
Daniel can do it.

33:45.157 --> 33:47.107
Daniel?

33:47.108 --> 33:49.060
Come on, Sullivan, step up.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.561
Okay.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.979
Sure, yes sir.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.398
I'll do the service, Father.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.433
There's consecrated
hosts in the...

33:55.434 --> 33:58.069
Tabernacle, I know.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.138
You know today's Gospel.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.639
Mathew, chapter two.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.710
You got a homily
prepared, too, kid?

34:05.711 --> 34:07.077
No, father.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.579
Well make one up.

34:11.750 --> 34:12.617
Go on, now.

34:12.618 --> 34:13.818
Okay, okay.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.286
Come on, come on, come on.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.327
My mom said you
crashed Father Rob's car.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.428
Uh huh.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.529
And that you don't
have a driver's license.

34:25.530 --> 34:26.630
That's right.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.731
How come you don't
know how to drive?

34:27.732 --> 34:28.833
Stop talking!

34:28.833 --> 34:31.335
Focus on the service, okay?

34:31.335 --> 34:32.601
Okay, sorry.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.215
Danny, hi.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.187
We're late, let's go.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.320
Good luck.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.531
Blessings of our
Lord Jesus Christ

35:33.532 --> 35:35.600
and God our Father to you all.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.902
And also to you.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.669
Please be seated.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.544
Father Rob

35:46.545 --> 35:49.680
fell under the weather
at the last minute,

35:49.681 --> 35:51.749
so he asked me to continue

35:51.750 --> 35:55.419
with a prayer
service this morning.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.855
It is my first time,
so please be gentle.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.731
"John the Baptist appeared
in the wilderness,

36:06.732 --> 36:09.834
"saying, 'repent, for the
Kingdom of Heaven is near.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.303
"'This is the one of
whom the prophets spoke

36:12.304 --> 36:14.906
"'when they said to straighten
the pathways for the Lord.'

36:14.907 --> 36:17.208
"So the people came
to him from all around

36:17.209 --> 36:19.810
"to be baptized by him
at the Jordan River,

36:19.811 --> 36:22.713
"and confessed their sins.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.783
"John said" I am
baptizing you with water,

36:25.784 --> 36:27.718
"'for your repentance,

36:27.719 --> 36:30.755
"'but the one who is coming
after me is more powerful.

36:30.756 --> 36:35.492
"'He will baptize you in the
Holy Spirit, with Fire.'"

36:37.262 --> 36:39.197
These are the words of our Lord.

36:39.198 --> 36:43.466
Praise to you,
Lord Jesus Christ.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.836
Father Rob would.

36:50.609 --> 36:53.243
I didn't really have time to.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.999
When I first took the time

36:59.000 --> 37:01.586
and read this passage on
my own a couple years ago,

37:01.587 --> 37:03.787
I thought it was strange.

37:06.491 --> 37:09.860
Why would Jesus, the Son of God,

37:09.861 --> 37:12.729
go get baptized by someone else?

37:14.533 --> 37:16.434
In Mathew's Gospel, Jesus,

37:16.435 --> 37:18.902
even though he was God's son,

37:20.005 --> 37:23.006
knew that he was
just a human too.

37:24.376 --> 37:28.246
So even he must seek forgiveness
for his own transgressions

37:28.247 --> 37:31.781
before he could fully
serve God's purpose.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.987
What a great role model, right?

37:39.258 --> 37:42.727
So let's be sure to
follow his example.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.930
I want all of you, on your
way out of mass this morning,

37:45.931 --> 37:49.500
to make sure and bless
yourselves with the holy water

37:49.501 --> 37:51.802
in those basins on the wall

37:51.803 --> 37:55.740
and ask God for his
forgiveness and his guidance

37:55.741 --> 37:58.559
before you head
out of this church

37:58.560 --> 38:01.379
and back into this day
that he has given you.

38:01.380 --> 38:05.515
We must continually prepare
and purify ourselves

38:07.953 --> 38:11.022
to be fully received
into God's grace.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.363
Body of Christ.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.364
Amen.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.801
Body of Christ.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.707
Body of Christ.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.708
Amen.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.414
The body of Christ.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.681
Amen.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.051
Body of Christ.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.052
Amen.

38:44.556 --> 38:45.556
Hi.

38:46.992 --> 38:47.992
Cross.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.462
Lord, bless Nicole in the name

38:52.463 --> 38:54.598
of the Father, Son
and the Holy Spirit.

38:54.599 --> 38:55.599
Oh.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.340
"Body of Christ?"

39:02.341 --> 39:03.540
But you're.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.344
But.

39:06.345 --> 39:07.711
Whatever, dude.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.658
Peace be with you.

39:29.868 --> 39:30.901
Body of Christ.

39:30.902 --> 39:31.902
Um.

39:34.106 --> 39:35.139
Body of Christ.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.140
Amen.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.384
Hey, you missed me.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.087
Don't leave a message because
I don't check my voicemail.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.540
Where the hell were you?

40:09.541 --> 40:10.740
What, I'm here.

40:10.741 --> 40:11.942
You didn't show
up for the service!

40:11.943 --> 40:14.044
I looked like an idiot!

40:14.045 --> 40:16.080
Marx took off already.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.915
He said after church.

40:17.916 --> 40:18.982
It's after.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.502
What, you didn't
think I was gonna...

40:22.503 --> 40:23.988
Come to my first
service ever, yeah.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.624
I showed up, all right?

40:26.625 --> 40:27.891
Jesus Christ,

40:27.892 --> 40:29.158
you think I came all
the way down here

40:29.159 --> 40:30.428
to be scrutinized
by my old teacher

40:30.429 --> 40:32.897
over some crappy waffles?

40:32.898 --> 40:35.566
I'm just trying to
help you out, bro.

40:35.567 --> 40:39.035
Why don't you be more
specific next time?

40:44.843 --> 40:45.843
How'd it go?

40:50.982 --> 40:52.583
Wanna eat?

40:52.584 --> 40:53.983
I'm not hungry.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.556
Well, if you're just gonna
sit on your ass and freeze,

40:58.557 --> 41:01.859
we might as well
be catching fish.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.934
So the other night,

41:09.935 --> 41:12.603
I was at a bar up in Bessemer

41:12.604 --> 41:16.240
and two priests walk
into the bathroom.

41:16.241 --> 41:17.524
Uh huh.

41:17.525 --> 41:18.809
So they step up to the urinals

41:18.810 --> 41:21.695
and one glances
over at the other

41:21.696 --> 41:24.582
and he sees a little square
patch on the other guy's pecker

41:24.583 --> 41:26.584
and he asks him,

41:26.585 --> 41:29.520
"Hey, does that
thing really work?"

41:29.521 --> 41:31.121
And the other priest says,

41:31.122 --> 41:33.557
"Oh yeah, I think so.

41:33.558 --> 41:36.226
"I'm down to three butts a day."

41:40.765 --> 41:41.765
Come on.

41:41.766 --> 41:44.168
I'm sure you got better ones.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.169
Easy.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.138
How thick it it?

41:48.139 --> 41:49.773
I don't know.

41:49.774 --> 41:51.074
Let's find out.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.081
Fuck!

42:00.819 --> 42:01.819
Woo!

42:03.788 --> 42:04.788
Oh God.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.768
Regular or crispy?

42:17.769 --> 42:18.769
Crispy.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.005
Okay.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.805
Burned them anyway.

42:28.547 --> 42:29.812
There we go.

42:31.850 --> 42:32.982
Good work.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.886
Give me one of those.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.820
You've earned this.

42:42.127 --> 42:45.262
Good meat, good drink,
good God, let's eat.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.263
Amen.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.203
See?

42:53.204 --> 42:54.304
I still know how to pray.

43:06.351 --> 43:07.851
So do you ever?

43:07.852 --> 43:08.852
What?

43:10.589 --> 43:12.122
Pray.

43:12.123 --> 43:13.123
No.

43:13.858 --> 43:15.592
Why not?

43:18.730 --> 43:22.800
Because I don't believe
in fairytales anymore.

43:22.801 --> 43:25.603
People spend their
entire lives feeling bad

43:25.604 --> 43:27.771
and trying to dig themselves
out of a bottomless pit

43:27.772 --> 43:29.740
so they can fly away to
some magical la la land

43:29.741 --> 43:31.108
after they die.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.209
It's bullshit.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.944
No it's not.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.279
What's wrong with
treating people

43:35.280 --> 43:37.281
how they would
like to be treated

43:37.282 --> 43:40.884
and teaching people not to
steal and not to murder?

43:40.885 --> 43:41.885
Murder?

43:41.886 --> 43:46.690
God is the single biggest
reason people murder each other.

43:46.691 --> 43:48.759
He's the biggest reason
that people help each other.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.027
He?

43:51.028 --> 43:53.297
Yes, schools, missions,
food for the poor, charities.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.065
If there is a God,

43:55.066 --> 43:56.400
He or She or It

43:56.401 --> 44:00.337
doesn't give a rat's ass
about what goes on down here.

44:00.338 --> 44:03.073
Why would you say that?

44:03.074 --> 44:06.076
Why would he let
millions of people suffer

44:06.077 --> 44:09.179
and starve and kill
each other over nothing?

44:09.180 --> 44:10.180
Huh?

44:11.716 --> 44:14.385
He let Christopher
die for no reason.

44:14.386 --> 44:16.420
We have free will.

44:16.421 --> 44:18.638
Oh, Jesus,

44:18.639 --> 44:20.858
don't give me that
"mysterious ways" bullshit!

44:20.859 --> 44:22.926
Chris was the best one of us.

44:22.927 --> 44:24.261
The one everyone liked.

44:24.262 --> 44:27.064
He was good at everything.

44:27.065 --> 44:29.732
It should've been me instead.

44:31.202 --> 44:32.202
Or you.

44:38.076 --> 44:41.712
Chris got in the car with
the wrong guy on the wrong day

44:41.713 --> 44:43.147
and the seat belts were broken

44:43.148 --> 44:44.815
and they were going 70 in a 45

44:44.816 --> 44:48.885
and I should've let him
take the fucking truck.

44:50.822 --> 44:51.822
Okay?

45:09.841 --> 45:12.076
There's a reason people
go to confession.

45:12.077 --> 45:14.344
They want a fresh start.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.814
They want absolution

45:16.815 --> 45:18.382
and God grants that.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.017
Oh, I know.

45:20.018 --> 45:21.952
People love to be told
that they're forgiven

45:21.953 --> 45:23.603
and it's not their fault

45:23.604 --> 45:25.255
when they've done
something they regret.

45:25.256 --> 45:26.857
You see,

45:26.858 --> 45:29.259
at least I have the integrity

45:29.260 --> 45:31.862
to accept the shitty
things I've done.

45:31.863 --> 45:33.062
Where as you,

45:34.065 --> 45:35.065
well,

45:35.066 --> 45:38.869
that's why you're
here, isn't it?

45:38.870 --> 45:40.237
Ice fishing?

45:40.238 --> 45:41.739
The church.

45:41.740 --> 45:43.390
I'm here because I'm called

45:43.391 --> 45:45.042
to spread the message
of God's love.

45:45.043 --> 45:46.493
No,

45:46.494 --> 45:47.945
you're here because you've
judged yourself guilty

45:47.946 --> 45:49.279
and putting on
that little outfit

45:49.280 --> 45:51.230
gives you the power
to drill that guilt

45:51.231 --> 45:53.183
into everyone else and have
them beg for the forgiveness

45:53.184 --> 45:55.318
that you can never have.

45:56.755 --> 46:00.157
And you're signing up to
punish yourself for life.

46:00.158 --> 46:01.224
Aren't you?

46:02.460 --> 46:05.195
I'm sorry if that's
what you believe

46:05.196 --> 46:07.046
but if you really think that,

46:07.047 --> 46:08.899
then I challenge you to
come to mass on Sunday.

46:10.201 --> 46:12.236
"Come to mass."

46:12.237 --> 46:14.438
Week after week, drop
a dollar in the hat

46:14.439 --> 46:16.806
and send a billion to the Pope

46:16.807 --> 46:19.176
so he can live in the most
lavished palace on the planet,

46:19.177 --> 46:20.043
tax free.

46:20.044 --> 46:22.912
If you came,

46:22.913 --> 46:25.783
you would see how much
positivity people get from it.

46:25.784 --> 46:28.050
A sense of community, man.

46:28.820 --> 46:29.820
Oh.

46:30.522 --> 46:31.522
A sense of

46:32.524 --> 46:34.191
"communion," eh?

46:34.192 --> 46:35.192
All right.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.132
Let's commune.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.133
We'll be

46:45.136 --> 46:46.269
commun-ists.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.439
You know,

46:49.440 --> 46:51.073
as best I recall,

46:53.011 --> 46:54.244
I don't remember
the bible preaching

46:54.245 --> 46:56.913
against this wonderful plant.

47:06.491 --> 47:10.193
Smoke this with me
and I'll come to Mass.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.973
Next Sunday.

47:22.974 --> 47:23.974
9 AM.

47:41.926 --> 47:44.862
And let's be honest, after
you sad little start-up here,

47:44.863 --> 47:45.995
you need me.

47:47.131 --> 47:49.233
Yeah, I guess so.

47:49.234 --> 47:50.567
Why, you do PR now?

47:50.568 --> 47:51.568
Game on!

47:59.244 --> 48:01.278
Keep it burning!

48:02.146 --> 48:03.212
Yeah, dude!

48:04.916 --> 48:06.283
Yeah!

48:08.553 --> 48:10.320
Oh, hold on, hold on.

48:10.321 --> 48:11.321
Woo hoo!

48:13.925 --> 48:15.292
Say, "cheese."

48:15.293 --> 48:16.960
Fromage!

48:16.961 --> 48:18.295
Nice.

48:18.296 --> 48:19.296
Woo!

48:21.299 --> 48:22.633
Well,

48:22.634 --> 48:24.167
you want some pike?

48:24.168 --> 48:26.203
Eh, Northerns
aren't any good.

48:26.204 --> 48:28.005
In the winter they are.

48:28.006 --> 48:29.573
Think Nicole would want it?

48:29.574 --> 48:31.507
As like a peace offering?

48:31.508 --> 48:33.443
If we filleted it
up or something?

48:33.444 --> 48:36.980
Although she is known
to munch the tuna,

48:36.981 --> 48:40.316
I'm pretty sure she's
a vegetarian, so.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.120
All right.

48:44.389 --> 48:47.123
Back to your home, little guy.

48:51.529 --> 48:53.597
Oh, get in there.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.198
He doesn't want to go.

48:55.199 --> 48:56.066
Woo!

48:56.067 --> 48:57.067
Huh?

48:57.702 --> 48:59.069
Hey,

48:59.070 --> 49:00.337
don't worry about the chicks.

49:00.338 --> 49:03.941
I got something
that will appease.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.078
Oh!

49:08.079 --> 49:09.079
Oh!

49:09.080 --> 49:10.080
Woo!

49:13.952 --> 49:14.952
Yes!

49:16.521 --> 49:17.521
Woo!

49:23.962 --> 49:24.962
Hey, Cass.

49:26.364 --> 49:28.481
Danny, Cassidy.

49:28.482 --> 49:30.599
Cassidy, the Deacon
Daniel Sullivan.

49:32.203 --> 49:34.371
I was raised Catholic.

49:34.372 --> 49:36.039
You could've given me communion.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.274
You didn't have to act
like a homophobic prick

49:37.275 --> 49:39.343
like that in front of everyone.

49:39.344 --> 49:41.445
I'm sorry, I didn't
think you were hungry.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.351
What the hell?

49:50.288 --> 49:52.489
Girlfriend, we come in peace.

49:52.490 --> 49:55.025
I have a present for you.

49:55.026 --> 49:56.626
Give it to me then.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.528
It would be better
for the both of us

49:58.529 --> 50:01.364
if I gave it to you in private.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.081
You smell like fish.

50:18.082 --> 50:21.684
Oh funny, I was gonna
say the same thing.

50:25.323 --> 50:28.091
Now this is just a
little peace offering

50:28.092 --> 50:30.427
from me and my brother, Daniel.

50:30.428 --> 50:35.298
But I still need that
hundred from the last one.

50:35.299 --> 50:36.299
I got

50:37.468 --> 50:38.468
60.

50:44.275 --> 50:45.275
Okay.

50:47.612 --> 50:48.328
Hey.

50:48.329 --> 50:49.046
Even Danny toked a little.

50:49.047 --> 50:50.447
Yeah, no shit.

50:50.448 --> 50:52.315
No, I did not.

50:52.316 --> 50:55.052
Said he's puff if I came
to church with him next week.

50:56.587 --> 50:59.356
I'm so sorry about church.

50:59.357 --> 51:02.158
I just had everybody watching me

51:03.795 --> 51:06.195
and a lot of restrictions

51:07.765 --> 51:09.766
and policies that

51:09.767 --> 51:11.601
a lot of individuals.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.239
You are so high right now.

51:17.608 --> 51:20.610
Don't, please
don't tell anyone.

51:20.611 --> 51:24.214
We don't exactly hang
out with the same people.

51:24.215 --> 51:25.148
You see?

51:25.149 --> 51:26.550
That's the problem.

51:26.551 --> 51:29.553
And that is why Danny
and me are throwing

51:29.554 --> 51:32.722
a full-moon Soirée this week,
down at the fishing hole.

51:32.723 --> 51:33.723
Outside?

51:33.724 --> 51:35.608
Hell no.

51:35.609 --> 51:37.494
We're gonna have a
bonfire, booze, tunes,

51:37.495 --> 51:39.096
and there's always
the little shanty

51:39.097 --> 51:41.498
if you wanna warm
up and get cozy.

51:41.499 --> 51:44.234
So you're going then?

51:44.235 --> 51:45.635
Yeah.

51:45.636 --> 51:47.337
Are you going?

51:47.338 --> 51:50.874
You guys should go
because it's gonna be fun.

51:52.510 --> 51:54.644
Okay, well I'll
bring the absinthe.

51:54.645 --> 51:55.712
Yes!

51:55.713 --> 51:56.847
All right!

51:56.848 --> 51:58.247
Woo!

51:59.650 --> 52:00.684
Should we smoke some of that?

52:00.685 --> 52:02.034
Yes.

52:02.035 --> 52:03.386
You're smoking us out.

52:03.387 --> 52:04.954
Come on, Cassidy.

52:04.955 --> 52:06.523
All right, all right.

52:06.524 --> 52:07.640
Dick.

52:07.641 --> 52:08.758
You are such a prick.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.164
So you're selling?

52:14.165 --> 52:15.732
That's your "work?"

52:15.733 --> 52:19.503
I provide a natural
alternative to pharmaceuticals

52:19.504 --> 52:21.872
for a select local clientele.

52:21.873 --> 52:23.640
You're a weed dealer.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.992
You do realize I just fixed

52:25.993 --> 52:28.345
everything with
them for you, right?

52:28.346 --> 52:30.679
Gotta make a living, amigo.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.349
You coming?

52:33.350 --> 52:34.284
I don't get it.

52:34.285 --> 52:35.785
You were Mr. Honor Roll.

52:35.786 --> 52:37.687
You were on the math team.

52:37.688 --> 52:42.825
You're so smart and you coulda
done anything with your life.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.629
It's just a little

52:45.630 --> 52:46.630
sad.

52:48.599 --> 52:52.202
I know you saw me at the
nursing home last week.

52:52.203 --> 52:53.203
Yeah.

52:53.871 --> 52:55.471
I should've said...

52:55.472 --> 52:57.072
That's no the point.

52:57.073 --> 52:58.675
The point is, I was there
because I bring medicine

52:58.676 --> 53:01.278
to a sick 82 year old woman
whose medical treatments

53:01.279 --> 53:03.213
sucked the life out of her.

53:03.214 --> 53:04.714
And I bring her the only thing

53:04.715 --> 53:06.216
that makes her feel any better.

53:06.217 --> 53:07.884
Let's her put food
in her stomach.

53:07.885 --> 53:09.853
Helps her sleep.

53:09.854 --> 53:12.589
She would take a visit from
me over one from you any day.

53:12.590 --> 53:17.226
So save your holier-than
thou attitude for the sheep.

55:11.709 --> 55:13.709
Hello?

55:13.710 --> 55:15.712
Are you trying to kill
me before the cancer does?

55:15.713 --> 55:17.663
Father Rob?

55:17.664 --> 55:19.616
You got friends
making a scene in Church?

55:19.617 --> 55:21.685
You stood up the Marxes?

55:21.686 --> 55:23.353
You got arrested

55:23.354 --> 55:26.323
and the car's been impounded?

55:26.324 --> 55:28.758
Am I missing anything here?

55:28.759 --> 55:29.759
Yes, no.

55:31.462 --> 55:32.729
No, you're not.

55:32.730 --> 55:34.864
I wasn't arrest really.

55:34.865 --> 55:37.000
Even better question.

55:37.001 --> 55:39.703
Do I need to pull out my IV

55:39.704 --> 55:42.339
and personally come over there

55:42.340 --> 55:44.774
and knock some sense
into your thick head?

55:44.775 --> 55:47.126
No, Father.

55:47.127 --> 55:49.479
I'm assuming you're going
to wisely use your time

55:49.480 --> 55:52.849
and you're gonna get it
together for next Sunday

55:52.850 --> 55:54.717
because chances are,

55:55.720 --> 55:59.422
I'm not going to be
able to make it again

55:59.423 --> 56:00.857
and you're gonna
be the one up there

56:00.858 --> 56:03.492
in front of the congregation.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.662
Yes, sir.

56:05.663 --> 56:09.064
Now I expect to
hear a glowing report.

56:10.935 --> 56:11.935
Oh, hell.

56:11.936 --> 56:15.038
Maybe I made a big
mistake with this.

56:15.039 --> 56:16.005
No, Father, I...

56:16.006 --> 56:17.440
Don't talk.

56:17.441 --> 56:19.109
Just fix it.

56:19.110 --> 56:23.913
And for the love of God,
Danny, don't fuck it up!

56:23.914 --> 56:26.015
Don't F it up.

56:26.016 --> 56:29.085
Yeah, that's right.

56:29.086 --> 56:30.086
Okay.

56:34.592 --> 56:35.592
Bye.

He was too sick.

57:39.924 --> 57:43.059
Why aren't you holding
confession today?

57:43.060 --> 57:44.994
That is one of
the few privileges

57:44.995 --> 57:47.230
I won't have until I'm ordained,

57:47.231 --> 57:48.697
unfortunately.

57:52.770 --> 57:54.871
You're welcome to visit
Father Rob in hospice.

57:54.872 --> 57:56.272
You know, I'm sure he would be...

57:56.273 --> 57:57.674
You're supposed to be
helping out the Church

57:57.675 --> 58:00.176
wherever you can, yes?

58:00.177 --> 58:02.111
Absolutely, Mr. Sheraski.

58:02.112 --> 58:04.062
Then you'd have
a minute to speak

58:04.063 --> 58:06.015
to a parishioner in
confidence, wouldn't you?

58:06.016 --> 58:07.183
I guess I could.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.518
Thank you, come on.

58:08.519 --> 58:11.154
Let's go somewhere else though.

58:12.723 --> 58:14.257
This one's fertilizer.

58:16.160 --> 58:17.160
Oh man.

58:18.229 --> 58:20.997
Is that Clarence or John Paul?

58:20.998 --> 58:22.966
I think they're identical.

58:22.967 --> 58:26.803
This other one doesn't
look much better.

58:28.572 --> 58:30.006
Don't!

58:30.007 --> 58:31.007
What?

58:32.943 --> 58:34.911
I could've taken
him to Father Rob

58:34.912 --> 58:38.014
for a blessing or a
burial or something.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.816
I don't know.

58:39.817 --> 58:44.620
Just get him a new one, he
won't know the difference.

58:45.656 --> 58:48.824
What did you want
to talk to me about?

58:52.663 --> 58:53.796
Thank you.

58:53.797 --> 58:57.966
I thought your homily
was a bit clunky.

59:00.070 --> 59:02.938
But I agreed with
your sentiment.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.008
Thanks.

59:06.009 --> 59:07.809
There are some things I'd...

59:09.947 --> 59:11.214
I'd just like your ear

59:11.215 --> 59:13.849
and a guiding hand in prayer.

59:14.785 --> 59:15.918
Certainly.

59:22.326 --> 59:24.593
Dear Heavenly Father,

59:25.829 --> 59:30.299
I was rude to this young man
whose competence I doubted.

59:31.635 --> 59:33.001
But I was wrong,

59:34.038 --> 59:35.772
and see that he is
capable of being

59:35.773 --> 59:38.641
the leader we expect him to be.

59:38.642 --> 59:41.945
He gave us directions to
stay on the right path

59:41.946 --> 59:44.713
and to keep your church sacred.

59:48.619 --> 59:49.619
I...

59:52.022 --> 59:53.022
I...

59:57.761 --> 59:59.027
Even at my age

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.831
and with a family.

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:07.302
Go on, yes?

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:11.006
It's a poison of the mind

01:00:12.009 --> 01:00:15.811
but I can't help but
dwell in impure thoughts

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:19.047
from time to time.

01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:24.987
That's a very
common affliction.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:33.795
Can you help me purge
these sinful urges, Daniel?

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:41.370
Only God and a strong
will can do that.

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:45.874
Let's pray together.

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.244
Yes.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:50.012
Please, let's pray.

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:59.022
Hail Mary.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:00.089
Full of grace

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.724
the Lord is with thee.

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:03.926
Blessed art thou among women,

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:07.864
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:08.997
Stop that!

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:14.903
Pray for your sins.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:17.339
I'm sorry.

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:23.680
Your best hope for salvation

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:27.683
is to seek God's mercy
through reconciliation.

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:30.419
That's why I'm here.

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:35.357
Go see Father Rob.

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:39.094
I can't help you.

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:52.141
Thank you for your
service, Father.

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.142
Deacon.

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:58.047
I can't take that.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.482
It's for the Church.

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:03.119
Bart!

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.811
Hail Mary full of grace

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:30.179
the Lord is with thee.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.882
Blessed art thou among
women and blessed.

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:41.957
What's this?

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:44.493
A donation.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.456
Why do you do it?

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.061
Why do I do what?

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:25.367
Give so much of
yourself to the Church.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:31.574
Well.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:42.418
That's...

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:47.355
That's between me
and God, Daniel.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:04:01.102
Whatever happened with Bart,
I'm sure you did your best.

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:05.307
We've all got
something, don't we?

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:10.378
Yes we do.

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:20.523
I shouldn't have
to tell you this

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:23.859
but everything
happens for a reason.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.332
I left my math
homework at home.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.067
I need the truck.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:08.037
Find a ride
with somebody else.

01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:16.177
I miss you.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:50.947
Hey.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.213
Hey, Nicole.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:57.986
I figured you needed a ride.

01:05:58.522 --> 01:05:59.956
A ride where?

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:01.223
Well it's a full moon.

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:02.625
You said you were
going, come on.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.026
Oh.

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:05.328
Yeah.

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:07.396
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:11.100
I got a hundred things
to work on for Sunday.

01:06:11.101 --> 01:06:12.969
It's only Thursday.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.004
You have all weekend
to study your homework.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.538
Cassidy's driving.

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:22.644
What's this?

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:27.515
This is Saint Christopher.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:32.721
He's the patron
saint of travelers.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.258
Jesus appeared to him as a child

01:06:36.259 --> 01:06:38.995
and carried him
across a raging river

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:43.332
with the weight of the
world on his shoulders.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:48.203
He's just supposed to keep
you safe during your travels.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.206
Christopher.

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:00.149
Come on.

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:11.026
Will you have me
home by midnight?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.429
Shotgun.

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.430
Okay.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:18.601
Okay.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:40.189
Hey!

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:42.458
Who invited this narc?

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.095
Better late than never.

01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:47.595
Come on, come on.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.666
Woo!

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:51.667
Shotskis!

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.605
Hey, Dan the man,
you're in this too.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.373
Let's go, let's go.

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:01.476
Okay.

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.479
Uno, dos, tres, down the hatch.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.183
Woo!

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.184
What was that?

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:10.319
That, my friend,

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.455
is the finest Canadian
blended whiskey money can buy.

01:08:12.456 --> 01:08:15.591
I'm sorry, does your pussy hurt?

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:17.792
Even Danny took it like a man.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:20.162
Danny the
derelict deacon, huh?

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.363
Is that on a T-shirt yet?

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:25.868
So what exactly
is a deacon anyway?

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.671
It's like an assistant coach.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.087
Okay,

01:08:30.089 --> 01:08:31.506
so like if the priest
is Mike McCarthy,

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:33.542
then you're like Dom Capers?

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.344
Good analogy.

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:38.647
Jesus.

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:41.716
Between the two of you,
it feels like a minority

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:44.452
to be a regular straight dude.

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:46.255
You guys.

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:48.122
Just kidding, bro.

01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:50.524
You still play?

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.627
Do it.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:56.497
I need to warm up, literally.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.346
If you're feeling warmer.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:25.292
Do you have a pick on you?

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:27.429
Thank you.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.244
Yeah.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.823
Woo!

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.341
Oh yeah!

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:59.688
Come on, guys, is
that all you got?

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.727
Anthony, goddamn it,
did you piss in the fire?

01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:15.331
That's what happens when you
put it on frozen water, dude.

01:12:15.332 --> 01:12:17.032
This is bullshit.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:19.635
Where are we gonna go?

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:21.070
Plan B.

01:12:21.071 --> 01:12:22.504
Where?

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:29.011
You've got to be kidding me.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:30.412
What the hell are you doing?

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:31.980
It's a big empty house,

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:34.049
ideal for hosting a
gathering of friends.

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:35.416
No!

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.785
There's no way in hell we're.

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:37.702
Okay, okay.

01:12:37.703 --> 01:12:38.620
Okay, go, go, go, go.

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:39.887
Go, go, quiet!

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:41.857
Quiet!

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.359
If anything happens.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.993
We might
accidentally have fun.

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:45.994
Oh!

01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:52.367
Okay, all right.

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:55.137
Coming through.

01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:56.371
Okay, okay.

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.910
What the hell?

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:02.778
Hey!

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:03.645
El Derelicto!

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:04.979
Give me that.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:09.918
It's all right, it's
all right, I got it.

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:10.919
Hey,

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:14.523
it's all good, okay?

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:15.524
What do you need?

01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:16.792
Here.

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.026
Have a malt beverage.

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:19.728
Whose is this?

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.497
It's mine.

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:23.065
You can have it.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.133
I don't.

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:27.136
No, no, don't be rude to

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.470
the hot girl.

01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:29.805
Who are you again?

01:13:29.806 --> 01:13:30.939
I'm Stacy.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.306
You guys are gonna play, right?

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:33.675
Oh yeah, just
as long as I win.

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:34.910
Deal us in.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.661
Hermano?

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:38.414
You're lucky I'm not kicking
everybody out right now.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:39.681
It's okay, darling.

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:40.682
Relax.

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:42.617
Sir, ma'am?

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:45.020
No, next round.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:47.456
I wanna make a toast.

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:51.493
Hey.

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:56.064
To my brother.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:03.571
Yeah!

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:12.580
I'm out.

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:14.817
Three sixes.

01:14:14.818 --> 01:14:16.452
No way.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.588
Read 'em, count 'em
and strip, sweetheart.

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:20.856
Oh.

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:22.173
You were bluffing?

01:14:22.174 --> 01:14:23.492
Uh oh.

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:24.693
You don't have to.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.728
Oh yes she does.

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:27.996
I'll cover my eyes.

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:31.834
Do I?

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:33.568
I took mine off.

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:36.872
Let's see 'em.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:42.911
Ah!

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:44.178
Clever girl.

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:46.280
Thank you.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.549
Who's dealing?

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.257
What?

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:56.258
Come on.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.160
Babe!

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:00.963
Danny!

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:02.631
Yeah?

01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:04.233
Can you bring me my shirt?

01:15:04.234 --> 01:15:06.268
I don't know, my
hands are pretty full.

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:07.135
Come on!

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:08.536
Okay, okay.

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:21.183
Will you hook
my bra up for me?

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.784
My hands are frozen.

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:23.652
Oh, yeah.

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.053
Yeah.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:26.054
Yeah.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:32.761
You get much
practice with this?

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:35.898
Only when the nuns need help.

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:36.899
I'm just kidding.

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:26.181
Time to go, ladies, come on.

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.115
Time to go!

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.049
Time to go!

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:28.984
Everybody, time to go!

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:30.719
Thank you, thank you!

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.787
Thank you for coming!

01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:33.155
Thank you, time to go!

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:35.623
Time to...
She's out, man.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.226
What?

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:48.036
What's the matter?

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:50.739
Is Nicole gay or what?

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.742
I mean, all girls
are a little bit gay.

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:56.678
Nic, she just likes
whoever she likes.

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:57.646
Why?

01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:58.647
Because.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.818
Anything to see my boobs, huh?

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:04.018
Absolutely.

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:06.622
Oh, no, no, no, no!

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.024
Goddamn, girl.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.295
Revenge is mine, bitch.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:16.365
If you want me to take
off my pants just ask.

01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:18.734
You cheat at cards, so.

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:19.800
I do not.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.104
Do you have any dry threads?

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:23.038
Yeah.

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:24.139
Upstairs.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.374
Come on.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:34.949
Mi casa, su casa.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720
God.

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.126
Woo!

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:45.260
Nice butt.

01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:47.262
Hi.

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:50.332
Ow.

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:51.333
Ow.

01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:04.745
Sullivan sandwich.

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:12.387
Hey.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:13.388
What?

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:17.092
I barely got to see anything.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:18.093
I know.

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:20.996
Danny saw more than you.

01:18:20.997 --> 01:18:21.997
Oh yeah?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.333
Not worthy.

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:29.771
They're very pretty.

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:30.839
Pretty?

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.707
They're very nice.

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:16.218
Danny.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.154
Danny.

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:43.164
Sorry.

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:52.173
I should've even
have to be here, Danny.

01:21:52.174 --> 01:21:54.142
Where's my freaking chainsaw?

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:55.010
I need it.

01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:56.945
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:21:56.946 --> 01:21:58.746
What's going on?

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.547
You look like a
truck ran over you.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:02.350
Oh, yeah, I'm just feeling
a little under the weather.

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:03.351
I can ask Jake for you.

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:04.286
Is he here?

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:05.486
Let me talk to him.

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:06.686
No, he's asleep.

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:09.991
You know what, forget it.

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:11.326
I don't need to talk to him.

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:14.696
Just have it back
by noon, all right?

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.063
Noon today?

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:18.400
Yeah!

01:22:18.401 --> 01:22:19.401
Today!

01:22:29.512 --> 01:22:32.180
It's down at the hole.

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:34.581
Well let's go get it then.

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:21.662
It was right here by the wood.

01:23:42.018 --> 01:23:43.550
This is perfect.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.420
A picture of your life.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.025
Alone in the cold, surrounded
by a bunch of trash.

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:53.194
Thank you for
dragging me into it.

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:56.164
You came looking
for me, remember?

01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:57.165
Dumb ass.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:24:00.735
You know, I prayed to Chris
to bring us closer together

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:02.537
and then Nicole showed
up, out of the blue,

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:03.738
wanting to drag me out here.

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:04.672
That messed me up.

01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:06.474
I wasn't gonna come.

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:09.144
Do you hear yourself?

01:24:09.145 --> 01:24:10.545
You got what you prayed for,

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.147
so I don't get what
you're so pissed about.

01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:14.315
This isn't what I wanted.

01:24:14.316 --> 01:24:16.117
Well, I had a good time.

01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:18.319
All I wanted, Jake,

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.522
was for you to do something
right for once and stop,

01:24:20.523 --> 01:24:23.324
stop embarrassing yourself.

01:24:23.325 --> 01:24:26.127
You're the embarrassment.

01:24:26.128 --> 01:24:28.563
Signing your life
away over guilt

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.765
for something you
didn't even do.

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:34.669
I am the reason that
Chris got into that car.

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:36.070
Yeah, well,

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:42.342
I'm the reason why he
didn't have his homework.

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.780
What?

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:48.550
He pissed me off.

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:49.750
So I took it.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:52.486
That morning

01:24:53.222 --> 01:24:54.588
before we left.

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:02.263
You never told me
about this before.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:04.264
What did he do to you?

01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:08.202
I don't even remember.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:11.873
I was 15.

01:25:11.874 --> 01:25:15.209
It as probably something stupid.

01:25:19.415 --> 01:25:20.814
So what, Jake?

01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:26.420
Chris dies and you
say screw college?

01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:29.157
Screw getting a job?

01:25:29.158 --> 01:25:31.893
Screw my family,
screw everybody?

01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:33.260
Pretty much.

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:34.627
Why can't you get
your shit together?

01:25:34.628 --> 01:25:35.994
You haven't stepped
foot back here in years.

01:25:35.995 --> 01:25:37.365
You could've gotten
out of this shit hole!

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:39.600
I barely finished school.

01:25:40.603 --> 01:25:41.669
What did you?

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:43.538
What was I gonna do?

01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:46.207
Move with Mom and
Dad to Phoenix?

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:47.775
You were halfway
across the country.

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:49.677
At least I had friends here.

01:25:49.678 --> 01:25:51.078
What did you expect?

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.480
We were all crushed, Jacob.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:53.681
We all had choices to make.

01:25:53.682 --> 01:25:55.048
Yeah, yeah,

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.417
and yours was to ditch me

01:25:56.418 --> 01:25:58.720
for a bunch of hypocrites
and pedophiles.

01:25:58.721 --> 01:26:01.305
The seminary saved my life.

01:26:01.306 --> 01:26:03.890
The seminary saved you
from living your life!

01:26:04.894 --> 01:26:07.395
Yeah, no, you just
had to make sure

01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:10.165
that you were gonna
be broke and alone.

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:11.733
So I guess we have a
little bit in common,

01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:13.734
you fucking hypocrite!

01:26:15.838 --> 01:26:17.638
Don't call me that.

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.440
The first girl who lays
hands on you since college

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:21.910
and you're ready to dip
your dick, Mr. Chastity.

01:26:21.911 --> 01:26:23.545
Shut up!

01:26:23.546 --> 01:26:24.746
Or what?

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:26.414
You'll hit me?

01:26:26.415 --> 01:26:27.649
Huh?

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:30.818
Come on, you little bitch!

01:26:30.819 --> 01:26:31.786
Hit me.

01:26:31.787 --> 01:26:33.020
Stop that!

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.255
Come on, I dare you!

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:54.675
Stop being a piece of shit!

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:24.806
Hey.

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:27.809
Come on, get up!

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:30.378
Come on, quick, quick!

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:41.689
Jake!

01:28:07.283 --> 01:28:09.350
Our Father,
Who art in heaven,

01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:11.286
Hallowed be thy name.

01:28:11.287 --> 01:28:12.587
Thy Kingdom come,

01:28:12.588 --> 01:28:13.921
Thy will be done

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:16.824
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.384
Hang in there, Dan.

01:28:43.385 --> 01:28:44.585
Stay with me!

01:28:44.586 --> 01:28:46.921
Stay with me, come on.

01:28:46.922 --> 01:28:48.455
Come on, buddy.

01:28:51.994 --> 01:28:54.595
How long ago was the EPI?

01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:56.463
Two minutes.

01:29:21.924 --> 01:29:22.924
Hey.

01:29:30.933 --> 01:29:32.532
Is he?

01:29:40.476 --> 01:29:41.442
Where's Jacob?

01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:42.576
He's here.

01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:44.812
Down the hall.

01:29:44.813 --> 01:29:45.946
He's stable.

01:29:47.449 --> 01:29:48.782
I'm so sorry.

01:29:56.792 --> 01:29:58.325
No, no, no, no.

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.859
No, no, don't touch that.

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:02.930
What time is it?

01:30:02.931 --> 01:30:03.997
After 11.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:07.000
It's Sunday.

01:30:09.004 --> 01:30:11.822
I hate to say this.

01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:14.641
Especially now, since
you're just coming around.

01:30:17.846 --> 01:30:20.580
This hasn't worked out at all.

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:23.818
Father Rob and I really
wanted it to but...

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:25.085
That's okay.

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:33.127
Bishop Byrnes is sending
up a new priest this week,

01:30:33.128 --> 01:30:35.562
so we packed your things.

01:30:38.634 --> 01:30:40.768
If they discharge you today,

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:42.904
you can make the
four o'clock bus.

01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:43.905
Oh, Danny.

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:51.511
You're a good kid.

01:30:55.684 --> 01:30:58.118
We're in a tough spot is all.

01:31:02.724 --> 01:31:03.724
Best of luck.

01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:46.833
They're talking
about cutting them off.

01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:50.187
What about you?

01:31:50.188 --> 01:31:51.504
You got all eleven?

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:04.651
I blacked out.

01:32:05.988 --> 01:32:09.589
They say my heart
stopped for an hour.

01:32:12.928 --> 01:32:15.595
I don't get how we got out.

01:32:16.999 --> 01:32:20.066
I just remember
trying to get air

01:32:20.936 --> 01:32:23.270
and inhaling so much water.

01:32:24.106 --> 01:32:25.106
Went dark.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:31.745
I had some crazy hallucinations.

01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:35.983
You coulda...

01:32:35.984 --> 01:32:36.951
No, I didn't mean to...

01:32:36.952 --> 01:32:38.119
No, I'm sorry.

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.820
Don't apologize.

01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:41.589
It's not your fault.

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:43.291
You saved me.

01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:44.292
Dude.

01:32:47.829 --> 01:32:48.829
Marx?

01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:52.266
He says he found
us on the ice.

01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:53.267
What?

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:56.904
We somehow

01:32:58.974 --> 01:33:00.073
climbed out?

01:33:02.611 --> 01:33:03.611
Yeah.

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:21.962
Nic brought it.

01:33:29.371 --> 01:33:31.172
So they're shipping me off.

01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:37.645
They're firing you?

01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:38.912
Essentially.

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.985
So back to priest
university then?

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.160
See that?

01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:08.008
Man, this party's lame.

01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:12.045
When did you get good?

01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:15.115
It's been awhile now.

01:34:19.054 --> 01:34:20.655
The priest said you got hurt.

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:22.689
We hope you get better.

01:34:25.227 --> 01:34:27.228
It's fresh, just
needs to be reheated.

01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:29.764
Mom, I wanna learn guitar.

01:34:29.765 --> 01:34:31.232
Sweetie, we can't...

01:34:31.233 --> 01:34:33.901
Do you give lessons?

01:34:33.902 --> 01:34:34.902
Oh.

01:34:41.043 --> 01:34:42.075
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:43.245 --> 01:34:44.245
I do.

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:47.213
Give me that.

01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:03.164
Give us a call when
you feel up to it.

01:35:03.165 --> 01:35:04.165
Mhmm.

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:19.747
Giving your number
to a 10 year old?

01:35:19.748 --> 01:35:21.115
That's my type, bro.

01:35:23.118 --> 01:35:24.919
You know what I'm
talking about, Father.

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.220
Oh my.

01:35:28.724 --> 01:35:30.124
You're sick.

01:35:34.796 --> 01:35:35.995
Okay, here.

01:35:36.865 --> 01:35:37.865
Help me out.

01:35:37.866 --> 01:35:38.866
Okay.

01:35:42.204 --> 01:35:44.739
Tell Nicole to bring
my ride around back.

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:46.273
For real?

01:35:46.274 --> 01:35:49.642
I can't afford this shit

01:35:49.643 --> 01:35:53.011
and I'm not sure I'm down with
them chopping off my foot.

01:35:56.284 --> 01:35:57.151
You good?

01:35:57.152 --> 01:35:58.486
Okay, yeah.

01:36:39.361 --> 01:36:41.929
Can you forgive me?

01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:44.298
If I hadn't have dragged
you out that night

01:36:44.299 --> 01:36:45.533
when you wanted to stay and...

01:36:45.534 --> 01:36:46.867
No, don't.

01:36:46.868 --> 01:36:51.839
My horoscope said that
something really small

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.207
was gonna turn into
something so much bigger.

01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:55.074
Nicole, it's okay.

01:36:56.812 --> 01:36:59.212
None of this was your fault.

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:24.504
Are you sure?

01:37:27.309 --> 01:37:29.843
Just be good to yourself.

01:37:53.935 --> 01:37:54.935
Ow.

01:38:00.976 --> 01:38:01.976
Oooh.

01:38:09.184 --> 01:38:11.184
So what's next then?

01:38:14.556 --> 01:38:16.991
A four hour bus ride.

01:38:16.992 --> 01:38:18.892
Smelling dairy farms.

01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:22.630
And then a shit storm
from Bishop Byrnes

01:38:22.631 --> 01:38:25.132
when I get back to campus.

01:38:25.133 --> 01:38:26.667
Sounds like a gas.

01:38:26.668 --> 01:38:28.235
Yeah.

01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:29.569
What about you?

01:38:30.972 --> 01:38:33.474
Probably smoke some bud.

01:38:33.475 --> 01:38:35.309
Fire up the Nintendo
while I wait to see

01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:37.645
if my toes fall off or not.

01:38:41.182 --> 01:38:44.217
A pair of dynamic
young prodigies.

01:38:48.924 --> 01:38:49.924
Well.

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:04.604
Stay out of trouble, Dan.

01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:03.363
You know, I figured I'd

01:40:04.466 --> 01:40:06.567
stick around for awhile.

01:40:06.568 --> 01:40:10.003
Until the whole toe
thing blows over.

01:40:11.072 --> 01:40:14.041
Help you with some firewood

01:40:14.042 --> 01:40:16.709
and kick your ass at Mario Kart.

01:40:21.449 --> 01:40:22.449
