- You can't just quit.

00:03.849 --> 00:05.849
I'm not quitting.

00:05.901 --> 00:07.351
I'm going to work for Louis.

00:07.403 --> 00:08.936
Your sleepless nights
aren't going to stop

00:08.988 --> 00:10.104

00:10.106 --> 00:11.739
that your secretary
isn't coming back.

00:11.774 --> 00:14.191
And I told you
they'll stop when she does.

00:14.243 --> 00:15.826
This is my formal notice,
but I have no intention

00:15.861 --> 00:17.778
of leaving you high and dry,
so let's talk about

00:17.780 --> 00:19.113
finding you someone
in the next two weeks.

00:19.165 --> 00:20.447
Do you know
what's best for me?

00:20.499 --> 00:22.116
- Ripping the Band-Aid off.
- Harvey--

00:22.168 --> 00:23.117
So why don't you
clean out your desk

00:23.169 --> 00:24.668
and walk yourself
over to Louis?

00:24.704 --> 00:26.203
Hey, Harvey, if there are
any hard feelings with Donna--

00:26.255 --> 00:27.871
No, Louis, no hard feelings.

00:27.923 --> 00:28.956
Okay, but I just want to say
if there were--

00:29.008 --> 00:30.674
I said there's
no hard feelings.

00:30.710 --> 00:32.292
Jack Soloff has been
going around the firm

00:32.293 --> 00:33.794
saying you're never gonna
save that company.

00:33.796 --> 00:36.547
Since when do you care so much
about what Jack Soloff says?

00:36.599 --> 00:38.265
Since he's a senior partner
with ambition.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.380
I called your father today.

00:39.385 --> 00:41.602
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,
will you marry me?

00:41.637 --> 00:44.054
Yes.

00:52.865 --> 00:55.449
How come I never get
to pick the places we eat?

00:55.484 --> 00:57.117
Because I don't want
chicken nuggets for dinner,

00:57.153 --> 00:59.787
and you could take a break
from them yourself.

00:59.822 --> 01:01.205

a little healthy heart

01:01.240 --> 01:02.823
next to this
duck liver mousse.

01:02.825 --> 01:05.826
Very funny.
I got Mike to try it.

01:05.878 --> 01:07.544
I can't help it
if the man is whipped.

01:08.714 --> 01:10.197
Speaking of which,
let me see that ring

01:10.232 --> 01:11.799
your mother
keeps talking about.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.467
Ooh.

01:13.502 --> 01:15.502
Okay. I guess he knows
what he's doing.

01:15.554 --> 01:19.673
Well, he's marrying me,
so obviously.

01:19.725 --> 01:21.425
While we're on the topic...

01:28.184 --> 01:30.818
- This is a prenup.
- Yeah. I had Tom draw it up.

01:30.853 --> 01:33.187
It's actually
a standard boilerplate--

01:33.239 --> 01:34.905
I don't wanna start
my marriage

it's going to end.

01:36.525 --> 01:38.358
Rachel, that is not what
a prenup is for,

01:38.360 --> 01:39.726
and you know that.

01:39.762 --> 01:41.802
It's to isolate assets
in order to protect yourself.

01:41.831 --> 01:43.230
I don't have assets
to protect.

01:43.265 --> 01:44.698

02:06.222 --> 02:07.888
I will be taken care of,

why I had that drawn up,

08:38.172 --> 08:39.571
And I don't give a shit--
I'm not letting you sell

08:39.607 --> 08:41.126
your company
for pennies on the dollar.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.607
Where the hell
is this coming from?

08:42.643 --> 08:44.176
It's coming from the fact that
life is short,

08:44.211 --> 08:46.144
I'm burnt out,
and I'm ready to move on.

08:46.197 --> 08:47.529
Life is short?

08:47.565 --> 08:48.897
That's your reason
for not thinking this through?

08:48.949 --> 08:50.065
I don't want
to think it through.

08:50.117 --> 08:53.318
I might change my mind
and not do it at all.

08:53.370 --> 08:55.988
Okay, Teddy,
you want to sell?

08:55.990 --> 08:58.323
Sell, but we built this company
from the ground up.

08:58.325 --> 09:01.159
Give me a week
to get you a better offer.

09:01.212 --> 09:03.879
I'll give you the same thing
they're giving me.

09:03.914 --> 09:06.415
48 hours.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.166
Then I'll take it.

09:11.338 --> 09:13.255
By the way,
where's Donna?

09:13.307 --> 09:15.390
- She moved on.
- You see?

09:15.426 --> 09:17.175
That's what
I'm talking about.

09:17.228 --> 09:18.393
Life is short.

09:18.429 --> 09:19.895
Donna moved on
to something better.

09:19.930 --> 09:22.014
She didn't move on
to something better.

09:22.066 --> 09:23.315
What do you mean?

09:23.350 --> 09:24.516
She's working for Louis.

09:24.568 --> 09:26.351
Litt?
What the hell happened?

09:26.403 --> 09:27.403
Nothing happened.

09:27.404 --> 09:28.854
Just time for a change.

09:28.856 --> 09:30.906
Ah.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.061
If she's working for that
asshole, something happened.

09:33.077 --> 09:35.060
Teddy, you say you know
when it's time to move on,

09:35.095 --> 09:38.530
it's time to move on
from this topic right now.

09:38.532 --> 09:41.199
Okay, Harvey.

09:41.201 --> 09:45.370
All I'm saying is Mrs. Keebler
out there ain't no Donna.

09:53.213 --> 09:54.763
Twice in two days?

09:54.798 --> 09:56.265
People are gonna get
the wrong idea.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.716
Well, they can think what
they're gonna think,

09:57.768 --> 09:59.551
but it's not going to stop me
from giving my boy

09:59.603 --> 10:01.603
an engagement gift.

10:01.639 --> 10:03.522
- You're giving me a case?
- It's not just any case.

10:03.557 --> 10:06.024
This is right up your alley.
Do-gooder lane.

10:06.060 --> 10:07.809
- All right.
- Listen, Mike.

10:07.861 --> 10:09.645
These people got the shaft
for one reason.

10:09.697 --> 10:11.897
They're poor, and no one
gives a shit about 'em.

10:11.949 --> 10:14.466
They need a hero,
and you're that guy.

10:14.501 --> 10:15.567
Why aren't you that guy?

10:15.619 --> 10:17.235
Oh, I am that guy,

10:17.288 --> 10:19.571
but you're the one
getting married to Rachel Zane.

10:19.573 --> 10:21.907
The same Rachel Zane
that I almost got fired,

10:21.959 --> 10:24.409
and then you gave me
a second chance.

10:24.461 --> 10:26.244
So this is your way
of making it up to me?

10:26.280 --> 10:27.546
Listen, Mike,
talk to the plaintiffs,

10:27.581 --> 10:29.414
listen to their stories,
and I promise you

10:29.466 --> 10:31.466
it'll break
your little bleeding heart.

10:32.970 --> 10:33.970
Thank you, Jimmy.

10:33.971 --> 10:35.420
Yeah, you bet.

10:35.472 --> 10:37.839
What if I can't get
Jessica to sign off?

10:37.891 --> 10:39.591
Then I'll just
take the case back

10:39.593 --> 10:41.677
and get you a decanter
or some shit.

10:43.814 --> 10:45.180
So it's unanimous.

10:45.232 --> 10:46.848
From now on,
all first-years are required

10:46.900 --> 10:49.601
to bill 2,800 hours
and bring their own lunches.

10:49.603 --> 10:51.653
Congratulations, Louis,
another generation

10:51.689 --> 10:53.822
of associates
smacked into submission.

10:53.857 --> 10:55.657
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:55.693 --> 10:57.159
I think I'm done
with this meeting.

10:57.194 --> 10:58.493
Harvey, please,
we still have new business.

10:58.529 --> 11:00.112
Speaking of which,
I'd like to propose a change

11:00.114 --> 11:02.614
to the current
compensation formula.

11:02.616 --> 11:03.949
Excuse me?

11:03.951 --> 11:05.500
Well, since taking over
the committee,

11:05.536 --> 11:07.452
I've been evaluating
pay structures,

11:07.504 --> 11:09.588
and I think it's high time
that this firm

11:09.623 --> 11:11.957
put a larger emphasis
on billable hours.

11:12.009 --> 11:14.626
Why don't you stick
to the 48th floor, Jack?

11:14.628 --> 11:16.962
I take it you have a problem
with my proposal.

11:17.014 --> 11:18.263
You're damn right I do.

11:18.298 --> 11:20.182
I just took on the sale
of a man's company,

11:20.217 --> 11:22.601
and my entire fee
is contingent-based.

11:22.636 --> 11:24.469
Because you operate
as your own entity,

11:24.521 --> 11:27.556
while the rest of us are members
of a team known as this firm.

11:27.608 --> 11:28.890
No, because I bring in

11:28.942 --> 11:30.442
a truckload of money
for this firm.

11:30.477 --> 11:32.944
Well, like I said, special rules
for Harvey Specter.

11:32.980 --> 11:33.945
You know what, Jack?
That's enough.

11:33.981 --> 11:35.864
The current system
works fine,

11:35.899 --> 11:36.865
and I don't appreciate
you speaking to Harvey

11:36.900 --> 11:38.116
in such
a disrespectful manner.

11:38.152 --> 11:39.701
- Are you shitting me?
- Harvey, I'm sorry.

11:39.737 --> 11:42.070
Save your sorries, Louis.
This meeting's over.

11:42.122 --> 11:43.455
Harvey, listen.
I'm on your side.

11:43.490 --> 11:45.050
Yeah. I don't need you
on my side, okay?

11:45.075 --> 11:46.375
- I have shit to do.
- Wait.

11:46.410 --> 11:47.376
I haven't even brought up
my proposal yet

11:47.411 --> 11:48.527
for the men's bathroom.

11:48.562 --> 11:50.328
You want to finish
being king for a day?

11:50.330 --> 11:51.413
Be my guest.

11:51.465 --> 11:53.665
Enjoy your coffee
and your 50 sugars,

11:53.717 --> 11:56.551
and go for it, but like I said,
I have shit to do.

12:03.010 --> 12:06.144
Stanley was a good man.

12:06.180 --> 12:08.063
Never missed a day of work,

12:08.098 --> 12:10.098
provided for his family.

12:11.602 --> 12:13.602
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

12:15.572 --> 12:16.855
What did happen?

12:16.907 --> 12:18.256
Like I told
the other lawyer,

12:18.292 --> 12:21.443
he went to the hospital
with chest pains.

12:21.495 --> 12:23.945
They said it was nothing.

12:23.997 --> 12:25.697
He kept complaining.

12:25.749 --> 12:28.266
Stanley never complained.

12:28.302 --> 12:31.336
Two days later
they released him.

12:31.371 --> 12:34.306
Stanley went to sleep
in our bed that night.

12:34.341 --> 12:37.259
And he never woke up.

12:37.294 --> 12:39.211
No.

12:39.213 --> 12:40.879
He didn't.

12:40.931 --> 12:42.764
Are you sure the hospital
released him

12:42.800 --> 12:44.966
because the insurance company
cut his stay?

12:45.018 --> 12:47.352
He was sick, Mr. Ross,

12:47.387 --> 12:49.638
and they just sent him home.

12:49.690 --> 12:51.857
There are over 200
other people

12:51.892 --> 12:54.893
who had the exact same thing
happen to them.

12:54.895 --> 12:56.394
You think
that's a coincidence?

12:56.396 --> 12:58.113
No, I don't,

12:58.148 --> 13:00.482
which is why I'm considering
reopening this case.

13:00.534 --> 13:03.068
So what's stopping you?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.319
Well, for one thing,
I want to know

13:04.371 --> 13:05.704
why your other lawyer
dropped out.

13:05.739 --> 13:07.906
Because they worked that man
to the bone.

13:07.908 --> 13:10.242
He almost lost
his entire practice,

13:10.294 --> 13:13.745
but I was told that you're
with a big, powerful firm.

13:13.747 --> 13:16.631
I am...

13:16.667 --> 13:18.083
but I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

13:18.085 --> 13:19.801
to get them
to sign off on this.

13:19.837 --> 13:22.804
So what are we
supposed to do?

13:22.840 --> 13:24.756
You're supposed
to sit tight.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.344
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

13:29.396 --> 13:30.929
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

13:30.931 --> 13:31.980
You stormed out
of the meeting

13:32.015 --> 13:33.098
that we were supposed
to run together.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.900
I didn't storm out,
I walked out

13:34.935 --> 13:37.018
because you were doing
a shitty job running it.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.353
What are you talking about?
I had your back.

13:38.405 --> 13:40.605
After you let that clown
come after my salary.

13:40.657 --> 13:41.857
I didn't let him
do anything.

13:41.909 --> 13:44.326
I defended you,
and then you smack me down,

13:44.361 --> 13:46.161
after which I had
to postpone a presentation

13:46.196 --> 13:47.579
that I was
very passionate about.

13:47.614 --> 13:50.582
It's a bathroom, Louis.
It smells sometimes.

13:50.617 --> 13:51.937
So why don't you
just go in there,

13:51.952 --> 13:53.702
do what people do in there,
and get out of my face?

13:53.754 --> 13:55.370
You know what?
Donna was right.

13:55.422 --> 13:57.839
I should have never tried
to make things right with you.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.091
- Make things right with me?
- Yeah, Harvey.

14:00.127 --> 14:03.011
I let Jack do that so that
I could put him in his place

14:03.046 --> 14:05.463
and show you that I had
your back, but you can't see it

14:05.465 --> 14:07.799
because you're too damn jealous
of me and Donna.

14:07.801 --> 14:09.935
- What did you just say to me?
- You're jealous.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.470
You know what, Louis,

14:12.523 --> 14:14.689
if I was so upset
about the two of you,

14:14.725 --> 14:16.641
why am I still paying
her salary?

14:16.693 --> 14:18.310
Bullshit.
The firm pays her salary.

14:18.312 --> 14:19.728
Not all of it.

14:19.780 --> 14:22.147
You see, when I brought her
over here from the DA's office,

14:22.149 --> 14:24.282
Jessica wouldn't hire her
because I was an associate,

14:24.318 --> 14:26.034
so I paid her salary.

14:26.069 --> 14:27.319
And then I made partner,

14:27.371 --> 14:29.821
and I didn't think it
was enough, so I paid her more.

14:29.823 --> 14:33.158
And again and again
and again.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.410
So I've had enough
of you telling me I'm jealous.

14:35.462 --> 14:37.078
Yeah, well, Donna
doesn't work for you anymore.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.380
She works for me,
and the only person

14:38.415 --> 14:40.549
who's gonna be taking care
of her salary--this guy.

14:40.584 --> 14:42.000
- You got that?
- Fine by me.

14:42.052 --> 14:43.585
But before you say that,

14:43.637 --> 14:45.420
you better know what you're
getting yourself into.

14:45.472 --> 14:47.138
Oh, yeah, I know what
I'm getting myself into,

14:47.174 --> 14:49.891
because you can't put a price
tag on a woman like that.

14:57.082 --> 14:58.132
I need to talk to you.

14:58.168 --> 14:59.300
Let me guess.

14:59.336 --> 15:01.169
You got into a pissing contest
with Harvey,

15:01.221 --> 15:03.504
he told you he's been
covering Donna's salary,

15:03.556 --> 15:05.840
you, out of pride, said that
you were going to take it on,

15:05.892 --> 15:07.425
and now you're here to find out
how much you're on the hook for.

15:07.477 --> 15:08.760
- Nothing like that.
- Oh, good.

15:08.762 --> 15:10.094
- Then what is it?
- Everything you just said.

15:10.096 --> 15:11.262
- Louis--
- Jessica, please.

15:11.264 --> 15:12.647
- I just want to see the number.
- Okay, Louis.

15:12.682 --> 15:13.865
You want to see the number?
Here's the number.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.684
Thank y--
holy goddamn shit.

15:16.736 --> 15:18.186
Are you sure you didn't
accidentally add a zero?

15:18.238 --> 15:20.238
Yes, I'm sure.

15:21.241 --> 15:22.357
Is there any way
the firm can--

15:22.409 --> 15:24.192
The firm is not going
to pick this up.

15:24.244 --> 15:26.494
Harvey knew that, and he chose
to pay her more anyway.

15:26.529 --> 15:27.662
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

15:27.697 --> 15:29.163
Well, it seems to me
you have two options:

15:29.199 --> 15:31.559
You can tell Donna that Harvey's
been augmenting her salary,

15:31.584 --> 15:32.700
and you don't want
to do it anymore.

15:32.752 --> 15:34.836
- Negatory.
- Or you can pay it yourself.

15:34.871 --> 15:36.587
- Not happening.
- There is a third option.

15:36.623 --> 15:38.706
I can send her
back to Harvey.

15:38.758 --> 15:40.758
How dare you?

15:49.552 --> 15:51.386
What do you mean I'm not liquid?

15:51.438 --> 15:55.690
Who told you
to only save 10% cash?

15:55.725 --> 15:57.308
Well,
I don't care what I said.

15:57.310 --> 15:58.476
Does my podiatrist
listen to me

15:58.478 --> 16:00.695
when I tell him
I have hammertoe?

16:01.865 --> 16:02.864
Is everything okay, Louis?

16:02.899 --> 16:05.149
- Everything's wonderful.
- Okay.

16:05.201 --> 16:07.452
Actually, it occurred to me

16:07.487 --> 16:10.872
that we have not discussed
a very important subject.

16:10.907 --> 16:12.957
What is it?

16:12.992 --> 16:15.960
Donna, money's
a very sensitive issue.

16:15.995 --> 16:17.161
Mm-hmm.

16:17.163 --> 16:18.663
And I think you should be
fairly compensated.

16:18.715 --> 16:21.716
I mean, I know how hard it was
for you to leave Harvey for me,

16:21.751 --> 16:23.334
and I am forever grateful.

16:23.336 --> 16:25.336
- It's just that I--
- Louis, shh.

16:25.338 --> 16:27.672
I don't need a huge raise.

16:27.674 --> 16:30.224
The standard 2%
is more than enough.

16:30.260 --> 16:32.844
- 2%?
- Yes.

16:32.846 --> 16:34.345
You have a huge heart,

16:34.347 --> 16:36.931
but I already make more
than every other secretary

16:36.983 --> 16:38.182
at the firm, so--

16:38.184 --> 16:40.685
- 2% it is.
- Thanks, Louis.

16:40.737 --> 16:42.737
Don't mention it.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.866
Hey, do you have a second?

16:54.918 --> 16:56.567
I need your legal advice
about something.

16:56.603 --> 16:58.836
Yeah, of course.
What is it?

16:58.872 --> 17:01.372
My fiancée left this prenup
in the kitchen.

17:01.374 --> 17:04.275
I'm just wondering
if you think I should sign it.

17:06.846 --> 17:08.378
Mike, it's not
what it looks like.

17:08.381 --> 17:10.298
It looks like your father
had a prenup prepared

17:10.349 --> 17:11.715
for you to make me sign.

17:11.768 --> 17:13.217
Then it's exactly
what it looks like.

17:13.269 --> 17:14.852
And I'm guessing
you don't want me to sign it?

17:14.887 --> 17:16.220
No, I don't,

17:16.271 --> 17:18.222
because he's been trying
to control me my entire life,

17:18.223 --> 17:19.891
and I'm not gonna
let him do that with this.

17:19.943 --> 17:21.659
Has it occurred to you

17:21.694 --> 17:24.228
that maybe your father is only
doing this because he loves you?

17:24.230 --> 17:25.730
I don't really care
why he's doing it.

17:25.781 --> 17:27.865
Great marriages
don't start with contracts.

17:27.901 --> 17:29.567
- I know that.
- Then why are you grilling me?

17:29.619 --> 17:31.235
Hey.

17:31.237 --> 17:33.538
Because there's a reason that
you didn't tell me about this,

17:33.573 --> 17:36.741
and I need to know
what it is.

17:36.743 --> 17:39.243
My dad said
he doesn't know the man

17:39.245 --> 17:43.297
that I'm choosing to marry,

17:43.333 --> 17:46.167
and I just--

17:46.219 --> 17:49.320
I didn't want
to tell you that.

17:49.355 --> 17:53.140
- Well, I found out anyway.
- Yeah.

17:53.176 --> 17:56.594
Rachel, in the future,

17:56.646 --> 17:58.312
I want you to feel comfortable
telling me this stuff

17:58.348 --> 18:00.765
in the first place.

18:00.817 --> 18:02.600
I will.

18:10.944 --> 18:12.527
Mr. Specter, I wanted to--

18:12.579 --> 18:13.778
You're still here?

18:13.830 --> 18:15.329
I don't leave
until you leave.

18:15.365 --> 18:17.031
Well, in that case, what time
is my meeting with Adidas?

18:17.083 --> 18:18.165
11:15.

18:18.201 --> 18:20.585
I moved your 11:00 to 3:00
and your 3:00 to 5:00.

18:20.620 --> 18:21.586
- Did you line up--
- Buyers?

18:21.621 --> 18:23.454
I did
but not for another week.

18:23.456 --> 18:25.039
Nike and Puma are overseas,
and you said

18:25.091 --> 18:26.707
Reebok didn't matter
if the other two can't be there.

18:26.759 --> 18:28.209
God damn it.

18:28.261 --> 18:30.127
- There's one more thing.
- What difference does it make?

18:30.179 --> 18:31.963
I can't delay the sale
if I don't know

18:32.015 --> 18:33.855
why my client is dumping
his company on a whim.

18:33.883 --> 18:35.683
That's the one more thing.

18:35.718 --> 18:37.268
Mr. Doyle's best friend died

18:37.303 --> 18:38.936
a month ago
of pancreatic cancer.

18:38.972 --> 18:40.354
He was 46.

18:40.390 --> 18:41.606
How'd you know that?

18:41.641 --> 18:43.524
Something he said to you
just before he started

18:43.560 --> 18:45.526
talking shit about me
stuck in my head.

18:45.562 --> 18:47.144
What exactly was that?

18:47.146 --> 18:49.814
When people say "life is short"
two times in 30 seconds,

18:49.866 --> 18:51.983
it's usually right
after somebody died.

18:51.985 --> 18:53.734
I take it you were listening
to our conversation.

18:53.786 --> 18:55.903
That's what
good secretaries do.

18:55.955 --> 18:58.289
- Sorry about the Keebler thing.
- You didn't say it.

18:58.324 --> 19:00.491
Besides, it doesn't take
Albert Einstein to figure out

19:00.543 --> 19:02.326
why you hired somebody
that look like me

19:02.378 --> 19:03.961
to replace somebody
that look like her.

19:03.997 --> 19:05.079
Listen, Gretchen, I--

19:05.131 --> 19:07.298
You don't have to worry
about that with me.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.333
I prefer my men manly.

19:11.337 --> 19:14.505
Am I not manly?

19:14.507 --> 19:16.507
Well, if you have to ask...

19:24.183 --> 19:26.350
Mike, how you doing?

19:26.352 --> 19:27.568
Robert.

19:27.604 --> 19:28.936
What can I do for you?

19:28.988 --> 19:31.272
I heard you wanted me
to sign a prenup.

19:31.324 --> 19:32.990
I did.

19:33.026 --> 19:34.108
I hope
you didn't take it personally.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.776
Of course not,
I'm happy to sign it,

19:35.828 --> 19:37.194
but Rachel did say
that you don't know

19:37.246 --> 19:40.281
what kind of guy I am,
so I thought I'd come here

19:40.333 --> 19:44.835
to show you that this is
the kind of guy I am.

19:44.871 --> 19:46.621
You're going
after Kelton Insurance?

19:46.673 --> 19:48.372
It's not about
who I'm going after.

19:48.374 --> 19:50.174
It's about
who I'm representing.

19:50.209 --> 19:52.176
I'm putting my ass on the line
for 200 people

19:52.211 --> 19:54.011
who have no one to fight
for them other than me,

19:54.047 --> 19:55.796
so if you're worried that
I'd go after Rachel's money

19:55.848 --> 19:57.014
if something went wrong--

19:57.050 --> 19:58.432
You're not
that type of guy.

19:58.468 --> 19:59.934
No, I'm not.

19:59.969 --> 20:01.769
I respect that.

20:01.804 --> 20:02.887
Thank you, sir.

20:02.939 --> 20:05.306
But let me
tell you something.

20:05.358 --> 20:08.309
I used to be one
of those people,

20:08.361 --> 20:11.562
and I scratched and clawed
my way to where I am today,

20:11.614 --> 20:13.147
which is why I know

20:13.199 --> 20:15.116
when you come from nothing
and you make yourself

20:15.151 --> 20:16.817
into something,
you're always waiting

20:16.869 --> 20:18.749
for the day they're gonna
come and take it away.

20:18.788 --> 20:21.372
I'm telling you
that I come from nothing,

20:21.407 --> 20:22.573
and I would never do that.

20:22.575 --> 20:24.375
I'm not saying
you're gonna take it.

20:24.410 --> 20:25.543
I'm saying
you might do something

20:25.578 --> 20:27.244
that makes
someone else take it.

20:27.246 --> 20:28.579
What do you mean?

20:28.581 --> 20:30.081
You're learning at the feet
of Harvey Specter

20:30.133 --> 20:31.382
and Jessica Pearson,

20:31.417 --> 20:32.667
and they know
something I know.

20:32.719 --> 20:35.152
You're gonna be
a great lawyer.

20:35.188 --> 20:38.222
You're gonna
crack some eggs,

20:38.257 --> 20:39.924
and you never know
when someone's gonna come at you

20:39.926 --> 20:42.393
to take what's yours
for something you did.

20:42.428 --> 20:44.562
- Robert, I would never--
- Let me finish.

20:46.599 --> 20:49.233
I'm telling you this
because you're gonna be family.

20:49.268 --> 20:53.604
You might not have crossed
any lines yet, but you will.

20:53.606 --> 20:57.324
I'm just trying
to protect my baby girl.

20:59.529 --> 21:01.445
Jessica,
you wanted to see me?

21:01.497 --> 21:03.581
Actually, Louis
wants to see both of us.

21:03.616 --> 21:04.865
Then let's get it over with.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.534
Okay.

21:06.586 --> 21:07.952
I would like to propose

21:08.004 --> 21:09.453
a revamping
of the pay structure

21:09.455 --> 21:11.122
under the following guidelines.

21:11.174 --> 21:13.874
We increase the percentage
of billables the partners get.

21:13.926 --> 21:16.127
We decrease the percentage
of contingent fees

21:16.129 --> 21:17.762
- by an offsetting amount.
- What?

21:17.797 --> 21:18.929
That's what Jack Soloff
said yesterday.

21:18.965 --> 21:20.297
No, this is different.

21:20.299 --> 21:22.600
I've capped the amount
it affects any one partner.

21:22.635 --> 21:23.968
You got to be shitting me.

21:24.020 --> 21:25.770
I know you're wondering why
I'm proposing this.

21:25.805 --> 21:27.972
It's crystal clear
why you're proposing it.

21:28.024 --> 21:30.474
You get the exact amount
to cover Donna's salary,

21:30.526 --> 21:31.559
and you take it
out of my paycheck.

21:31.611 --> 21:32.611
Louis--

21:32.612 --> 21:33.561
This has nothing to do
with that.

21:33.613 --> 21:34.613
Jack had a great idea.

21:34.647 --> 21:35.730
It just needed
some fine-tuning.

21:35.782 --> 21:37.348
Fine-tuning?
You're the one that said

21:37.383 --> 21:38.866
you only let him
bring it up

21:38.901 --> 21:40.234
so that you can
smack it down.

21:40.286 --> 21:41.485
Is that true?

21:41.487 --> 21:43.654
Yes. Maybe, but I had
some time to think about it.

21:43.706 --> 21:44.989
Jack put something
on the table,

21:45.041 --> 21:46.457
and it's our duty
to follow through on it.

21:46.492 --> 21:48.492
Oh, bullshit--you're only
following through on it

21:48.544 --> 21:49.960
because you're a cheap
son of a bitch.

21:49.996 --> 21:50.996
Harvey.

21:50.997 --> 21:52.129
I don't want to hear it,
Jessica.

21:52.165 --> 21:53.831
Yesterday, he accused me
of being jealous.

21:53.883 --> 21:55.203
Today, he's coming
after my money.

21:55.218 --> 21:56.467
- No, I'm not--
- Shut up.

21:56.502 --> 21:58.469
We both know Donna
going to work for you

21:58.504 --> 21:59.670
has nothing to do with you.

21:59.722 --> 22:01.138
- You got lucky.
- Lucky?

22:01.174 --> 22:02.923
Like a monkey
who won the lottery,

22:02.975 --> 22:05.509
so the least you can do is
be a man, pay her yourself,

22:05.511 --> 22:07.261
or suck it up
and tell her the truth.

22:07.313 --> 22:08.429
All right. That's enough.
We're not doing this.

22:08.481 --> 22:09.681
- I am a name partner.
- Louis.

22:09.682 --> 22:11.015
No. He has no right to--

22:11.050 --> 22:13.517
I will slap the taste
out of your mouth.

22:19.325 --> 22:20.407
Thanks, Jessica.

22:20.443 --> 22:22.026
I appreciate you being
on the same page.

22:22.028 --> 22:23.027
Oh, we're not
on the same page.

22:23.079 --> 22:24.411
What are you talking about?

22:24.447 --> 22:25.863
I wanted the two of you
to run that meeting yesterday

22:25.865 --> 22:28.065
to see if you were okay
with each other, but you're not.

22:28.084 --> 22:30.668
He may be cheap,
but he's right.

22:30.703 --> 22:32.419
You are taking your
Donna anger out on him,

22:32.455 --> 22:33.871
and it needs to stop.

22:33.923 --> 22:34.923
I don't have Donna anger.

22:34.924 --> 22:36.540
Oh, like hell you don't.

22:36.592 --> 22:38.342
And if you don't admit that
to yourself,

22:38.377 --> 22:40.795
I'll slap the taste
out of your mouth too.

22:49.765 --> 22:52.734
What you working on there,
Mike?

22:52.769 --> 22:56.771
Um, nothing.
Just some cleanup.

22:56.823 --> 22:58.023
What can I do
for you, Jessica?

22:58.075 --> 23:00.241
You can tell me why
you reopened a case

23:00.277 --> 23:01.609
against a major
insurance company

23:01.661 --> 23:04.779
we were never a part of
to start with.

23:04.781 --> 23:06.448
Um, I reopened it

23:06.450 --> 23:08.583
because I looked at it
and it's a winner.

23:08.618 --> 23:09.784
Well, I also looked at it,

23:09.786 --> 23:12.203
and I say it's a loser.

23:12.255 --> 23:13.255
Jessica, look--

23:13.256 --> 23:14.422
You took a case
on contingency

23:14.458 --> 23:17.125
where every plaintiff
is dirt poor,

23:17.177 --> 23:18.676
which means, even if we win,

23:18.712 --> 23:20.628
compensation for lost wages
is nothing.

23:20.630 --> 23:21.963
You're leaving out
punitive damages,

23:22.015 --> 23:24.215
and Harvey takes cases
on contingency all the time.

23:24.267 --> 23:25.884
Yeah, he takes them
to make money,

23:25.936 --> 23:27.302
not to save kittens
in trees.

23:27.354 --> 23:29.471
And I just told you
this is going to make money.

23:29.473 --> 23:31.056
And that's what you said
about Liberty Rail,

23:31.108 --> 23:32.273
and instead of making money,

23:32.309 --> 23:34.242
it almost ended
with Donna behind bars.

23:34.277 --> 23:36.144
No one is going to jail
for this.

23:36.196 --> 23:38.863
No, they're not, because it's
going to cost a fortune to fund,

23:38.899 --> 23:41.449
and I'm not laying out that kind
of money on a long shot.

23:41.485 --> 23:43.318
Jessica, look.
I promised myself that I--

23:43.320 --> 23:45.036
I don't care
who you promised.

23:45.072 --> 23:47.155
You took this case
without running it by me,

23:47.157 --> 23:49.290
and you did it
because you knew I'd say no.

23:49.326 --> 23:50.959
- Jessica--
- So that's enough.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.995
Dump it, or I will.

24:02.589 --> 24:04.506
I need to talk to you.

24:04.558 --> 24:05.840
Really?

24:05.892 --> 24:07.092
'Cause the last time
you talked to me,

24:07.144 --> 24:09.427
you told me to open my mouth,
and you slammed it shut.

24:09.479 --> 24:11.896
Because you wanted to go after
Harvey, but now I'm on board.

24:11.932 --> 24:14.399
- Why should I believe you?
- Answer me this.

24:14.434 --> 24:16.067
How many partners
do you have in your pocket,

24:16.103 --> 24:17.735
if we put your proposal
to a vote?

24:17.771 --> 24:19.104
I can get 45%.

24:19.156 --> 24:20.355
Well, then the reason
you can believe me

24:20.357 --> 24:21.606
is that I'm gonna get you
the difference.

24:21.658 --> 24:23.691
How you gonna do that
if you don't have the courage

24:23.693 --> 24:25.410
to back my plan
at your own meeting?

24:25.445 --> 24:27.495
By showing everyone
at this firm exactly

24:27.531 --> 24:28.780
what Harvey makes.

24:30.033 --> 24:32.117
Now I know
you're bullshitting me.

24:32.169 --> 24:34.169
You'd be fired
if you did that.

24:34.204 --> 24:35.920
Not if I do it by accident.

24:40.627 --> 24:42.293
Can you believe
that sneaker brings in

24:42.345 --> 24:44.379
over a billion dollars
from China alone?

24:44.381 --> 24:46.047
With earnings like that,
makes me wonder

24:46.099 --> 24:48.433
why you're trying
to rip off my client.

24:48.468 --> 24:50.135
Buying a man's company
for a fair price

24:50.187 --> 24:51.769
is hardly ripping him off.

24:51.805 --> 24:53.521
But it's not a fair price.

24:53.557 --> 24:56.274
You gave my client 48 hours
to take your offer.

24:56.309 --> 24:58.443
I'm gonna give you five minutes
to take mine.

24:58.478 --> 25:00.278
Double your money,
or I walk out the door.

25:00.313 --> 25:01.396
That's ridiculous.

25:01.398 --> 25:03.148
What's ridiculous
is you preying on a man

25:03.200 --> 25:05.066
who just lost
his lifelong friend.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.202
I'm a businessman,
not a grief counselor.

25:07.237 --> 25:08.620
Then let me counsel you
on this.

25:08.655 --> 25:10.488
Because he's grieving,
I have the ability

25:10.540 --> 25:12.060
to go to the board
and delay this sale.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.625
But you're not going to,
because you know

25:13.660 --> 25:15.493
it'll drive down
the price even more

25:15.545 --> 25:17.912
when he eventually
wants to sell anyway.

25:17.914 --> 25:20.081
You're right,
it will,

25:20.133 --> 25:21.883
but I'll tell you what,
Mr. Polk,

25:21.918 --> 25:23.918
it'll still be worth
more than your offer.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.554
And after my client's grief
passes,

25:26.590 --> 25:28.640
he may still want to sell,

25:28.675 --> 25:30.175
but it sure as hell
won't be to you.

25:30.227 --> 25:38.227
♪ ♪

25:54.618 --> 25:56.784
I got to call you back.

25:56.786 --> 25:58.786
How the hell
did you get in here?

25:58.838 --> 26:01.756
I fired your assistant
ten minutes after I fired you.

26:01.791 --> 26:03.291
Guess Amy still knows
how to get a person through.

26:03.293 --> 26:04.542
Congratulations.

26:04.594 --> 26:06.127
You made your way in.
You can make your way out.

26:06.179 --> 26:08.546
Not before I give you
the chance to make $20 million.

26:15.055 --> 26:16.304
Mm-hmm. What makes you think
I want to get in the business

26:16.356 --> 26:17.939
of underwriting
class-action lawsuits?

26:17.974 --> 26:19.814
Because you're in the business
of making money,

26:19.859 --> 26:21.476
and before you say no,

26:21.528 --> 26:23.144
I'm gonna give you
20% off the top.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.312
It's the best deal
out there.

26:24.364 --> 26:27.949
Well, that's not
good enough.

26:27.984 --> 26:31.319
25%.

26:31.371 --> 26:33.988
Are you authorized
to do that?

26:33.990 --> 26:35.957
No, you're not.

26:35.992 --> 26:38.312
Knowing you, you probably don't
even have the authorization

26:38.328 --> 26:39.661
to come to me
in the first place.

26:39.713 --> 26:41.713
I came to you because this is
our chance to make it right.

26:41.748 --> 26:43.998
Bullshit.
You need money.

26:44.050 --> 26:45.917
That's the only reason you're
standing here in front of me.

26:45.969 --> 26:48.503
Jonathan,
I could have gone anywhere.

26:48.505 --> 26:50.972
I came to you for the same
reason I went to Walter Gillis,

26:51.007 --> 26:52.090
to make it right.

26:52.142 --> 26:53.725
Pick up the phone
and ask him.

26:58.815 --> 27:01.816
I'm not Walter Gillis.

27:01.851 --> 27:05.520
Tell Amy I said "thank you"
for getting you past security,

27:05.572 --> 27:08.022
'cause now I'm gonna call
every investment banker I know

27:08.024 --> 27:10.024
and tell them to pass
on your offer

27:10.076 --> 27:12.360
because Mike Ross
can't be trusted.

27:23.757 --> 27:24.956
What the hell is this?

27:25.008 --> 27:26.374
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

27:26.376 --> 27:28.843
Yes, you do. This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

27:28.878 --> 27:30.795
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

27:30.847 --> 27:32.130
Donna, I need you to put that
back where you found it,

27:32.182 --> 27:34.215
and I need you
to put it back now.

27:34.217 --> 27:35.967
- I won't do it.
- That was not a request.

27:36.019 --> 27:37.051
- That was an order.
- I don't care.

27:37.103 --> 27:38.936
- I'm not gonna let you do this.
- See?

27:38.972 --> 27:40.855
I knew that you would jump
at the first opportunity

27:40.890 --> 27:42.390
you had to take his side
over mine.

27:42.392 --> 27:44.225
This isn't me
taking Harvey's side.

27:44.227 --> 27:47.395
This is me stopping you
from making a huge mistake.

27:47.397 --> 27:49.530
And if he did the same thing,
you wouldn't be stopping him.

27:49.566 --> 27:51.449
Harvey would never
do anything like this,

27:51.484 --> 27:53.067
and if he did,
I sure as hell would.

27:53.119 --> 27:54.569
- Oh, bullshit.
- No, Louis.

27:54.621 --> 27:55.737
It's not bullshit.

27:55.739 --> 27:58.039
You have no idea
how many times

27:58.074 --> 27:59.874
I kept him from
going overboard with you.

27:59.909 --> 28:01.949
- It was half my goddamn job.
- Well, you know what?

28:01.961 --> 28:03.161
You didn't stop him
every time,

28:03.163 --> 28:04.603
and you're not stopping me
this time.

28:04.631 --> 28:06.798
Now, give me that thing.

28:06.833 --> 28:08.166
Okay. Fine.
You don't want to put it back?

28:08.218 --> 28:09.250
- I'll do it myself.
- Louis--

28:09.302 --> 28:10.468
No. Donna, you know what?

28:10.503 --> 28:12.086
You came to work for me.

28:12.088 --> 28:13.388
You knew who I was
when you did,

28:13.423 --> 28:14.756
so now it's time
for you to decide.

28:14.758 --> 28:15.890
Are you with me or not?

28:39.885 --> 28:42.470
While I'm not opposed to
unexpected gifts on my desk,

28:42.472 --> 28:44.889
I do prefer
if they're made of chocolate.

28:44.941 --> 28:45.941
Got it.

28:45.942 --> 28:48.476
Next time I leave you
a signed prenup,

28:48.528 --> 28:49.778
it will be made of chocolate.

28:49.813 --> 28:53.565
Why did you sign it?

28:53.617 --> 28:55.700
- I went to see your dad.
- You did what?

28:55.735 --> 28:56.985
I wanted to show him

28:56.987 --> 28:58.953
what kind of man
his daughter was marrying,

28:58.989 --> 29:00.405
because I wanted him
to trust me.

29:00.457 --> 29:04.075
Mike, he doesn't trust anybody,
which is exactly why

29:04.127 --> 29:07.162
I'm not interested
in his marital advice.

29:07.164 --> 29:09.747
But like you said,
I would appreciate it

29:09.800 --> 29:11.299
if in the future,

29:11.334 --> 29:13.751
you tell me if you're gonna
do something like that.

29:13.804 --> 29:16.504
You're right, I should have told
you before I went over there,

29:16.540 --> 29:19.841
but for the record, instead of
getting him to trust me,

29:19.893 --> 29:21.643
I ended up trusting him.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.061
- Mike--
- Rachel, listen to me.

29:23.096 --> 29:25.847
I know you think that
he's doing this to control you,

29:25.849 --> 29:31.252
but he thinks he's doing it
to protect you.

29:31.288 --> 29:33.688
And the truth is
that I never had a father

29:33.740 --> 29:37.358
who could do something
like that for me, so...

29:37.410 --> 29:40.695
I think that you should try
and see where he's coming from.

29:57.264 --> 29:59.430
What's that?

29:59.466 --> 30:02.050
It's your new offer.

30:02.052 --> 30:06.187
- It's twice the money.
- It's what I do.

30:06.223 --> 30:08.306
And that's why
I pay you so much.

30:08.358 --> 30:09.941
I didn't do it
for the money, Teddy.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.559
I did it because you
were getting ripped off,

30:11.611 --> 30:12.810
and I'm not gonna let
that happen to you,

30:12.863 --> 30:17.232
no matter what
the circumstances.

30:17.234 --> 30:18.566
You found out.

30:18.568 --> 30:21.569
Why didn't you
tell me what happened?

30:21.621 --> 30:24.489
Because I didn't want you
to try and stop me.

30:24.541 --> 30:26.157
You still could have
come to me.

30:26.209 --> 30:27.458
And tell you what?

30:27.494 --> 30:29.794
That my best friend
from when we were seven died

30:29.829 --> 30:31.663
out of the blue?

30:31.715 --> 30:33.331
I hadn't spoken to him
in 20 years,

30:33.383 --> 30:35.333
because we got into a fight

30:35.385 --> 30:39.420
over some woman whose name
I can't even remember.

30:39.472 --> 30:42.056
And now I don't give a shit
about the sneaker business.

30:42.092 --> 30:43.975
Well,
I would have understood.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.978
Would you have?

30:47.013 --> 30:50.064
Look, Harvey,

30:50.100 --> 30:52.817
I appreciate what
you did for me.

30:52.852 --> 30:55.603
If I'm ever back in business,
you'll always be my lawyer.

30:56.606 --> 30:59.023
I'll always be your friend.

31:05.115 --> 31:07.415
- Louis, do you have a second?
- Oh, I don't know.

31:07.450 --> 31:09.701
What animal are you gonna
call me now? An iguana?

31:09.753 --> 31:11.085
I'm not gonna call
you anything.

31:11.121 --> 31:13.254
I'm here because I want
to put everything behind us.

31:13.290 --> 31:14.839
Well, aren't I lucky?

31:14.874 --> 31:17.709
Louis, please.

31:17.761 --> 31:20.428
You were right.

31:20.463 --> 31:24.465
I was a dick in that meeting
and again in the bathroom

31:24.517 --> 31:27.185
and again with Jessica.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.137
I said some things
that I wish I could take back,

31:29.139 --> 31:31.389
but we've been friends
with each other for a long time,

31:31.441 --> 31:36.945
and I don't want
to throw that away.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.314
You really mean that?

31:39.366 --> 31:40.782
I do.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.317
Come here.

31:46.623 --> 31:49.490
Harvey, this is amazing.

31:49.492 --> 31:52.493
I never thought
you would come to me and--

31:52.495 --> 31:54.629
- Oh, shit.
- "Oh, shit" what?

31:54.664 --> 31:57.131
I forgot. I have to put a bid
on an item on eBay.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.634

You got Mike to sign this?

My dad did.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.211
Then why are you
coming to me?

Yes. Mike.

That's the real reason

you told yourself it wasn't.

Undermine my relationship.

33:27.724 --> 33:29.290
Believe me.

33:29.325 --> 33:32.260
I learned that one
the hard way,

33:32.295 --> 33:35.096
which means you need
to ask yourself,

33:35.131 --> 33:39.667
how much do you
really love Mike?

33:39.702 --> 33:42.837
I love him all the way.

he and I don't always
see eye to eye,

like my father,

34:04.427 --> 34:05.726
for all of his faults,

34:05.762 --> 34:07.161
he would take a bullet

34:07.197 --> 34:10.965

happen to his little girl.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.016
Thank you.

but tonight drinks
are on you, my friend.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.784
That's fair.

As much as I appreciate it,
Jimmy, I got to return the gift.

34:33.623 --> 34:34.956
- What?
- Yeah.

34:34.991 --> 34:36.072
- I can't take the case.
- No, no, no.

34:36.126 --> 34:37.542
What do you mean
you can't take the case?

34:37.577 --> 34:39.409
Jessica won't lay out
the money for the man hours.

34:39.462 --> 34:41.496
Okay, then get somebody else
to lay out the money.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.831
Mike, investment banks
are taking stakes

34:43.882 --> 34:44.882
in shit like this now.

34:44.884 --> 34:46.000
You, of all people,

It didn't work.

34:58.565 --> 35:00.815
what the hell
is going on here?

35:00.850 --> 35:03.184
Okay. One of the victims
was my uncle Keith,

35:03.186 --> 35:05.153
but I didn't tell you about him
because my cousin came to me

35:05.188 --> 35:06.737
and asked me
to make it right,

35:06.773 --> 35:10.691
and I promised her
that I would.

35:10.727 --> 35:13.995
It's just I don't have the juice
at my firm,

35:14.030 --> 35:15.746

35:15.782 --> 35:17.198
I was too ashamed
to tell you.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.934

- No, Mike, listen.

35:19.969 --> 35:22.370
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you straight up.

35:22.422 --> 35:25.423
But, please,

35:31.598 --> 35:33.714
What can I do for you,
Jack?

35:33.716 --> 35:36.184
You can explain to me

35:43.810 --> 35:45.393
But now I do know
why you pissed

35:45.445 --> 35:46.894
all over my idea
at the meeting.

35:46.946 --> 35:48.563
This is confidential.

35:48.615 --> 35:50.481
It was confidential.

35:50.533 --> 35:52.900
Now, every senior partner's
seen it,

35:52.902 --> 35:54.402
and people are furious.

35:54.404 --> 35:56.037
I earn every penny I make.

35:56.072 --> 35:58.406
We'll see about that.

35:58.408 --> 35:59.624
What are you talking about?

35:59.659 --> 36:03.578
I just called for a vote
tomorrow on my proposal,

36:03.580 --> 36:05.129
and I hope you've been
saving your money,

36:05.164 --> 36:08.633
because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

36:24.871 --> 36:26.639
So this is why you said,
"Oh, shit."

36:26.641 --> 36:27.807
What's that?

36:27.809 --> 36:29.375
Oh, you know what it is,

36:29.410 --> 36:30.810
because you're the one
who left it

36:30.862 --> 36:32.445
in the goddamn copier.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.814
Oh, my God, Harvey,
I was making copies

36:34.866 --> 36:36.816
of everyone's salaries for
my records, and I must have--

36:36.868 --> 36:37.984
Bullshit, Louis.

36:37.986 --> 36:39.735
You did this
to come after me,

36:39.787 --> 36:42.655
and after I apologized,
you ran and tried to stop it.

36:42.657 --> 36:44.874
Harvey, please,
what's done is done,

36:44.909 --> 36:46.325
and like you said before,
we're friends.

36:46.327 --> 36:48.628
We can move past this, and we
can fight the vote together.

36:48.663 --> 36:50.997
There's no way I win the vote
after people see this.

36:51.049 --> 36:52.632
You want to get past it?
Admit what you did.

36:52.667 --> 36:54.166
That's automatic termination.

36:54.218 --> 36:55.334
Then we'll fight that
together.

36:55.336 --> 36:56.335
- Harvey, I can't.
- Louis!

36:56.337 --> 36:57.887
Jessica tried
to fire me once.

36:57.922 --> 36:59.338
I can't give her the chance
to do that again.

36:59.340 --> 37:00.340
Well, you know what?

37:00.341 --> 37:02.174
It's gonna happen again,

37:02.176 --> 37:04.810
because I know what you did.

37:04.846 --> 37:07.430
You know what?
That's enough.

37:07.482 --> 37:09.015
And you come at me
flinging accusations,

37:09.017 --> 37:10.182
well,
you better have proof.

37:10.234 --> 37:11.651
You have proof, Harvey?

37:11.686 --> 37:14.403
Yeah, I didn't think so.

37:19.661 --> 37:20.743
Harvey, you don't get
to come to me

37:20.778 --> 37:21.744
at all hours
of the night anymore.

37:21.779 --> 37:23.446
I'm here
because your new boss--

37:23.498 --> 37:25.197
- I know why you're here.
- Then you know what he did.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.282
And I need you to admit it,

37:26.334 --> 37:28.167
so I can block
their bullshit vote.

37:28.202 --> 37:29.785
And get Louis fired?

37:29.837 --> 37:31.954
He wouldn't be in this mess
if you'd have just stopped him

37:32.006 --> 37:33.372
from doing this
in the first place.

37:33.424 --> 37:35.925
Harvey, if I knew Louis was
gonna do something like this,

37:35.960 --> 37:37.209
and I'm not saying I did,

37:37.261 --> 37:39.345
then I would have
told him to his face not to.

37:39.380 --> 37:40.713
But if he went ahead
and did it anyway,

37:40.715 --> 37:42.515
then I'm not gonna
go behind his back to fix it.

37:42.550 --> 37:44.717
Because you always said,
"Once you pick a side,

37:44.719 --> 37:46.052
"if you're not loyal
to that side,

37:46.104 --> 37:47.053
then who the hell are you?"

37:47.105 --> 37:48.437
Then you should have
thought of that

37:48.473 --> 37:50.056
before you picked someone who
would do something like this

37:50.058 --> 37:51.557
in the first place.

37:51.559 --> 37:53.976
You want to know
what kind of man Louis is?

37:54.028 --> 37:56.228
This whole thing started
because he wanted to prove

37:56.280 --> 37:57.363
to you that he had your back,

37:57.398 --> 37:59.315
because he thought
you were jealous of us.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.951
No, this whole thing started

38:01.986 --> 38:05.037
because I told him that
I've been paying your salary

38:05.073 --> 38:06.739
since we came to the firm,

38:06.741 --> 38:09.575
and he was too cheap
to pay it himself and too weak

38:09.627 --> 38:13.462
to tell you the truth.

38:13.498 --> 38:15.514
And if you've kept that
from me for 12 years

38:15.550 --> 38:19.335
and you're only just telling me
now, then maybe you are jealous.

38:24.425 --> 38:27.426
Mike, how'd you get in?
Give you a key already?

38:27.478 --> 38:30.262
No. Laura let me in.
She said you'd be back here.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.264
I don't know why.

38:31.315 --> 38:34.266
I'm trying
to find something tasty.

38:34.318 --> 38:36.736
There's not one damn thing
that's bad for you

38:36.771 --> 38:37.903
in this entire house.

38:37.939 --> 38:39.155
Then I guess it's a good thing

38:39.190 --> 38:42.108
I didn't tell her
that I brought you these.

38:42.160 --> 38:46.078
Oh, chicken nuggets.

38:46.114 --> 38:47.780
Rachel made them herself.

38:47.832 --> 38:50.032
Deep-fried, not baked?

38:50.084 --> 38:51.167
You're welcome.

38:51.202 --> 38:52.668
She sign that prenup?

38:52.703 --> 38:56.372
No, but she sent those
because she realized the prenup

38:56.424 --> 38:59.625
was about love,
not control.

38:59.627 --> 39:02.845
Then I respect her decision.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.263
What changed her mind
about me?

39:04.298 --> 39:05.681
You really want to know?

39:05.716 --> 39:07.032
- Mm-hmm.
- Jessica.

39:07.068 --> 39:08.551
Oh, shit.
What did she say?

39:08.603 --> 39:10.302
I got to know that secret.

39:10.304 --> 39:11.554
I don't know
what she said to Rachel,

39:11.606 --> 39:14.940
but I know
what she said to me.

39:14.976 --> 39:16.942
So that's why you're here.

39:16.978 --> 39:20.146
You know those people that
I told you I was fighting for?

39:23.151 --> 39:25.451
Jessica's not
gonna go for it.

39:25.486 --> 39:26.719
I get it.

39:26.754 --> 39:29.288
Too much money to lay out
for too little payoff.

39:29.323 --> 39:33.959
But you said you came from
the same place as these people.

39:33.995 --> 39:38.247
Robert, they need someone
like you to fight for them,

39:38.299 --> 39:41.133
and I can't do it.

39:41.169 --> 39:43.752
So I'm asking you to.

39:43.805 --> 39:45.045
You think this case
is a winner?

39:45.056 --> 39:46.639
I do.

39:48.176 --> 39:50.509
Then what do you say
we do it together?

39:53.347 --> 39:54.680
What are you doing here,
Louis?

39:54.682 --> 39:56.565
I notice you didn't come
to the vote this morning.

39:56.601 --> 39:59.401
No, I didn't. I was busy
closing a deal for my client.

39:59.437 --> 40:01.570
Let me guess. You had 'em
backdate your sale to yesterday,

40:01.606 --> 40:03.022
so it falls
under your old pay structure?

40:03.074 --> 40:04.674
No, Louis,
that's something you would do,

40:04.692 --> 40:07.526
because unlike you, I don't
actually care about the money.

40:07.528 --> 40:08.861
You expect me
to believe that?

40:08.913 --> 40:10.446
I don't care whether you
believe it or not.

40:10.498 --> 40:13.699
My compensation package
was about recognizing what I do.

40:13.751 --> 40:15.034
Money was just a consequence.

40:15.086 --> 40:16.752
That's why I didn't mind
sharing it with Donna.

40:16.787 --> 40:18.254
- Now, get out.
- No.

40:18.289 --> 40:21.090
You did care about the money,
because it was the last thing

40:21.125 --> 40:23.092
you had that separated you
from me.

40:23.127 --> 40:25.344
- Excuse me?
- I got name partner.

40:25.379 --> 40:28.047
I got Donna,
and that drove you nuts.

40:28.099 --> 40:30.132
So you shit on me
at the meeting,

40:30.184 --> 40:32.101
and then you pretended
to apologize.

40:32.136 --> 40:33.636
I did apologize, Louis.

40:33.688 --> 40:35.221
I came to you
like a man,

40:35.273 --> 40:37.973
and then when I gave you
the chance to make it up to me,

40:38.025 --> 40:40.109
you choked,
like you always do.

40:40.144 --> 40:41.477
Well, how you like me now?

40:41.529 --> 40:43.779
Because the only thing you
had left was that you made more.

40:43.814 --> 40:45.481
And now you don't,
and I win.

40:45.533 --> 40:48.901
You didn't win anything.

40:48.953 --> 40:50.286
What are you talking about?

40:50.321 --> 40:53.405
I'm talking about the fact
that no matter what you get,

40:53.457 --> 40:55.124
you're always wanting more.

40:55.159 --> 40:57.459
And the problem
with always wanting more is

40:57.495 --> 41:00.079
that the second you get it,
it can always be taken away.

41:00.081 --> 41:01.330
You're not reversing
that vote.

41:01.382 --> 41:02.715
I'm not talking
about the vote.

41:02.750 --> 41:06.085
I'm talking
about what you value most.

41:06.137 --> 41:07.137
That's right.

41:07.138 --> 41:09.421
Might not happen today
or tomorrow,

41:09.473 --> 41:12.258
but it's gonna happen, because
I'm gonna make it happen.

41:12.310 --> 41:15.094
One day, you're gonna walk
into your office,

41:15.146 --> 41:16.962
and she's gonna be gone.
