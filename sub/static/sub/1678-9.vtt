OLDER TED: Kids, this is
a Thanksgiving story.

00:18.785 --> 00:21.219
<i>Thanksgiving in New York</i>
<i>is a wonderful time,</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:26.152
<i>It's a time for giving of yourself,</i>
<i>for thinking of your fellow man,</i>

00:26.259 --> 00:29.854
<i>A time when the unforgiving city</i>
<i>becomes a little kinder,</i>

00:29.996 --> 00:31.759
Well, I just ralphed.

00:32.432 --> 00:36.027
- How much did you guys drink last night?
- Not how much, what.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.130
The Thanks-tini,

00:38.371 --> 00:41.272
a fun and delicious new novelty drink
I invented.

00:41.374 --> 00:45.276
Cranberry juice, potato vodka,
and a bouillon cube.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.237
Tastes just like a turkey dinner.

00:49.816 --> 00:52.307
It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.

00:52.952 --> 00:55.682
You want a good holiday drink?
Try his Kwanzaa-politan.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.279
(CAR HORN HONKING)

00:57.757 --> 00:59.554
The shuttle's here!

01:00.727 --> 01:03.025
He hasn't been back home to Minnesota
since Christmas.

01:03.129 --> 01:05.358
- He's a little excited.
- Baby, we're holding up the shuttle.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.662
Do you have everything you need?
Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants?

01:08.768 --> 01:10.099
Underpants.

01:11.938 --> 01:14.930
So, Lil, Marshall's family.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.108
Whole weekend with the future in-laws.
You excited?

01:18.211 --> 01:22.511
- Yeah, no, it'll be fun.
- Lily, you just said, "Yeah, no."

01:23.516 --> 01:26.679
Did I? No, I love Marshall's family.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.048
- But, yeah, no, it'll be great.
- You just did it again.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.783
Yeah, no, shut up.

01:33.226 --> 01:34.955
Wait, so you're not going home
for Thanksgiving?

01:35.061 --> 01:37.928
- No, I have to work on Friday. You?
- I'm Canadian, remember?

01:38.031 --> 01:40.864
- We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.
- Oh, right, I forgot.

01:40.967 --> 01:44.562
You guys are weird.
You pronounce the word "out," "oute."

01:45.038 --> 01:47.199
You guys are the world's leader
in handgun violence,

01:47.307 --> 01:48.774
your healthcare system is bankrupt,

01:48.875 --> 01:52.641
and your country is deeply divided
on almost every important issue.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.174
Your cops are called Mounties.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.616
So, probably hanging out
with Barney, then?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.711
No. Barney's got
his own Thanksgiving tradition.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.780
Thanksgiving in a strip club. Who's in?

02:05.925 --> 02:09.088
The Lusty Leopard has
a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet.

02:09.195 --> 02:12.096
Plus, they do this thing.
Heather dresses up as a Pilgrim,

02:12.198 --> 02:16.897
and Misty dresses up as an Indian,
and they share a meal together.

02:17.103 --> 02:21.733
- Oh, Barney.
- I'm sorry. Native American.

02:23.209 --> 02:25.939
I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter,
serve food.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.672
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.181
I thought I'd just spend the day
giving back, you know, doing some good.

02:31.284 --> 02:33.377
- Canceling out Barney.
- Exactly.

02:33.586 --> 02:36.282
- Where are all my underpants?
- Did you check your suitcase?

02:36.422 --> 02:37.389
No.

02:38.758 --> 02:39.325
Let's go.

02:39.325 --> 02:39.950
Let's go.

02:40.059 --> 02:41.720
<i>OLDER TED; And go they went,</i>

02:41.828 --> 02:45.059
<i>All the way to St, Cloud, Minnesota,</i>
<i>Marshall's hometown,</i>

02:45.465 --> 02:48.457
<i>And as Lily stepped into</i>
<i>her fiancé's boyhood home,</i>

02:48.568 --> 02:50.195
<i>she received a big welcome,</i>

02:50.303 --> 02:52.032
Hello! We're home!

02:52.138 --> 02:54.333
(ALL EX CLAIMING)

02:54.841 --> 02:56.308
<i>A very big welcome,</i>

02:56.409 --> 03:00.277
<i>You see, at 6-foot-4,</i>
<i>Marshall was the runt of the Eriksen clan,</i>

03:00.380 --> 03:02.814
- Great to see you.
- Hey, you, too.

03:03.416 --> 03:06.510
Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.

03:07.053 --> 03:09.385
- Where's my almost daughter-in-law?
- Here I am!

03:09.489 --> 03:10.683
Over here!

03:12.892 --> 03:15.053
Well, you got yourself
a great little bride here, Son.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.185
- Yeah.
- That's great.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.491
All right, now, no farting around.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.429
Put your skates and your pads on, boys.
Game on in five minutes.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.626
Yeah. All right.

03:22.735 --> 03:25.295
- Oh, you gonna play hockey?
- Hike, hut!

03:25.405 --> 03:28.670
- With a basketball?
- Well, it's a combination of the two.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.676
- We call it "bask-ice-ball."
- We invented it.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.372
It's the most dangerous
and awesome sport in the world.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.211
Bask-ice-ball? Not ice-ket-ball?

03:38.318 --> 03:39.979
"Ice-ket-ball"?

03:40.987 --> 03:43.217
- Just sounds weird.
- Yeah.

03:43.323 --> 03:47.521
- It's bask-ice-ball, okay? And I'm the best.
- Oh, you wish.

03:47.627 --> 03:50.994
Oh, well, maybe that's just 'cause
you haven't seen me play.

03:51.097 --> 03:52.894
(ALL HOOTING)

03:53.166 --> 03:55.634
I don't know, honey.
It's not really a sport for a girl.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.499
Well, that's funny,
'cause your brother throws like a girl.

03:58.605 --> 03:59.902
(ALL JEERING)

04:01.241 --> 04:02.538
Marcus.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.241
- This is gonna be great.
- I know. I'm so psyched we did this.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.507
Man, look at all these people.

04:08.615 --> 04:11.311
Giving up their Thanksgiving to help
their fellow man.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.112
These have gotta be the best people
in New York.

04:14.721 --> 04:17.553
Excuse me, guys, coming through.

04:17.656 --> 04:20.285
- Barney?
- Well, hi, guys.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.554
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just the Lord's work.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.395
- But you're Satan.
- Guys, okay, look.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.125
I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here.

04:30.236 --> 04:32.796
I think it's important to help
the less fortunate.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.897
I'm the Angelina Jolie
of incredibly hot guys.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.573
This is a joke, right?
You don't actually volunteer here?

04:39.679 --> 04:42.739
Barney, we need you out front.
There is a logjam on the stuffing line.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.010
- Can you show them how it's done?
- I'm on it.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.781
- Wait, so, this is real? Barney does this?
- Every Sunday, all year long.

04:48.888 --> 04:49.877
He's our best volunteer.

04:49.989 --> 04:52.480
That's 'cause
I was trained by the best, Kendall.

04:52.692 --> 04:55.058
Anyway, we're psyched
to be here, Kendall.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.719
What do you need us to do?

04:56.829 --> 04:58.922
- Go home, we're full.
- ROBIN: What?

04:59.232 --> 05:01.097
We're volunteers, we're unpaid help.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.100
Can you ever really have
enough unpaid help?

05:03.202 --> 05:06.899
On the biggest volunteer day of the year?
Yeah, you can.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.476
- Come on, we just wanna help out.
- Kendall. They're cool.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.772
Fine. But I'm not promising anything.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.815
Wait here,
we'll let you know if we need you.

05:17.917 --> 05:21.182
Okay, well, I better get back out there.
There's a lot of food to give out.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.016
And a lot of smiles.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.951
I almost forgot.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.722
I know it's early,

05:29.829 --> 05:34.129
but you are a future Mrs. Eriksen.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.793
Oh, thank you.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.467
Well, it'll go great with my...

05:40.073 --> 05:41.506
I just love it.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.840
Okay, Lily, we're putting you
on salad duty.

05:44.944 --> 05:48.175
Oh, I make this
great frisée and endive salad

05:48.281 --> 05:50.681
with a coriander lime vinaigrette.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.751
But this is an American holiday.

05:54.654 --> 05:58.181
Lily, now that you're going to be
a Mrs. Eriksen,

05:58.958 --> 06:02.018
I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe:

06:02.762 --> 06:06.459
The Eriksen Family Seven Layer Salad.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.231
Seven layer salad?

06:11.537 --> 06:14.335
Six cups of mayonnaise?
That can't be right.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.672
Oh, no, dear. Sixteen cups.
Mayo's in that cabinet.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.950
Oh, my God, there is some
serious bask-ice-ball going on out there.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.987
Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face
with a snowball, which is a foul,

06:29.088 --> 06:30.851
'cause you only get
one snowball per possession,

06:30.957 --> 06:34.222
so I nailed him in the shin with my skate,
and then I totally dunked it.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.728
Yeah, you were sitting pretty,
till I whacked you with that mallet.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.457
Hey, gorgeous.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.364
You having fun?

06:41.634 --> 06:45.832
Yeah, but I kind of miss you.
Could you stay in here for a little bit?

06:45.938 --> 06:48.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.
It's halftime.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.807
Halftime's over.
Get your butts out here. Come on.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.879
And I hope you like the taste
of skate, dorko.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.511
- Go.
- Thanks, baby.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.144
Isn't this great?

07:01.254 --> 07:04.348
Can't you see why everybody
from my high school stays in this town?

07:04.824 --> 07:07.918
Hey, Marvin! You're the dorko, dorko!

07:13.633 --> 07:15.294
(SIGHS) Man, it's amazing out there.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.529
I've done so much good today,
I've got, like, a soul boner.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.473
Man, the way
the faces of the less fortunate light up

07:22.575 --> 07:24.008
when you give them
a hot, nutritious meal,

07:24.110 --> 07:25.941
is there a better feeling on earth?

07:26.112 --> 07:29.673
Yesterday, you said the best feeling
on earth was getting your toes sucked.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.714
Then you requested a high-five,
with your foot.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.012
Hey, Barn, what do you say
you let us sub in for you

07:37.123 --> 07:39.182
scoop stuffing for a little bit?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.089
You wanna scoop stuffing
your first day out?

07:41.194 --> 07:44.686
Hello, NFL,
can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.801
Okay, I finished the Gummi Bear layer
of the salad.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.303
What's next?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.241
Potato chips, of course.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.207
So, Lily, when are you gonna start
thinking about having a baby?

08:00.947 --> 08:04.940
Baby? You know,
I hadn't really thought about it.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.512
At all.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.883
<i>OLDER TED; Actually, Aunt Lily was lying,</i>
<i>It was all she'd been thinking about,</i>

08:10.022 --> 08:11.455
<i>You see, remember when she said,,,</i>

08:11.991 --> 08:13.754
Well, I just ralphed.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.724
<i>At that point, she was five days late,</i>

08:16.829 --> 08:18.421
<i>This was day six,</i>

08:19.465 --> 08:22.366
Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young
to have a baby, right?

08:22.468 --> 08:24.060
Oh, are you kidding?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.865
I was younger than you
when I had Marcus.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.338
Beautiful 15-pound boy.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.335
Not much bigger
than this turkey right here.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.309
Oh, boy.

08:42.388 --> 08:45.755
<i>OLDER TED; Now, if Lily was already</i>
<i>uneasy about joining the Eriksen family,</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:46.847
<i>imagine how she felt</i>

08:46.959 --> 08:50.918
<i>about possibly having a 15-pound Eriksen</i>
<i>growing inside of her,</i>

08:51.831 --> 08:53.799
That's a big baby, Judy.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.532
- The doctor thought he was twins.
- (TITTERING) Twins.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.031
Twins.

09:03.142 --> 09:06.475
This is crazy. When did it get so hard
to do charity work?

09:06.579 --> 09:08.342
I do charity work all the time.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.574
Remember when I said
I'd find you a girlfriend?

09:10.683 --> 09:13.675
Delightful. How's that little project
coming along, anyway?

09:13.786 --> 09:14.844
I'm working on it.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.514
I'm gonna introduce you to that girl
you've been staring at.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.784
What? That's crazy.
I haven't been staring at any girl.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.484
Have you met Ted?

09:21.727 --> 09:25.493
Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted,
and this is... Gone.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.124
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.

09:28.267 --> 09:32.966
- So, what do you do here, Ted?
- Well, I've been... Nothing. I do nothing.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.498
Well, if you wanna do something,

09:35.608 --> 09:37.906
you and your girlfriend can help
sort through these donations.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.103
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

09:40.212 --> 09:43.739
I used to be,
but I just wasn't enough woman for Ted,

09:43.849 --> 09:46.511
emotionally, or sexually.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.417
Oh, my God.

09:48.888 --> 09:52.790
So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?

09:53.459 --> 09:54.619
Okay, this is important.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.695
Go through all these boxes
of food donations,

09:56.796 --> 09:59.264
take out the really good stuff,
and put it into this box.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.424
Got it. Consider it sorted.

10:02.835 --> 10:03.859
Hey, we're in business.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.438
Hey, Barney's not gonna get
all the glory today.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.911
- Let's start with this one.
- Yeah.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.411
- Amen.
- ALL: Amen.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.949
Look who came to say good night.

10:19.051 --> 10:22.077
It's little Martin. Three months old.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.319
- Months? Three months?
- He's been drinking his milk.

10:26.425 --> 10:27.483
Oh, yeah.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.060
Hear, hear.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.954
And she's already pregnant again.

10:33.065 --> 10:36.159
Well, that's 'cause
those Eriksen boys' boys can swim.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.998
They got two tails
and a drill bit for a head.

10:40.239 --> 10:44.266
- Dad, you're embarrassing me.
- Don't worry about it, Son, she's cool.

10:44.377 --> 10:48.006
- She's gonna be an Eriksen.
- Yeah, well, not literally.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.842
'Cause, you know, I'm keeping my name.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.676
But the apron?

10:56.756 --> 10:59.452
Well, we haven't actually decided
anything yet, so we're gonna...

10:59.558 --> 11:02.584
No, I've decided,
and I'm keeping my own name.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.029
But Eriksen is a great last name.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.025
People know the Eriksens.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.604
Well, sure, in St. Cloud,

11:12.705 --> 11:15.868
but our kids aren't gonna be
growing up in St. Cloud.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.407
Right, baby?

11:20.012 --> 11:23.345
Well, why not St. Cloud?
I mean, I loved growing up in St. Cloud.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.179
St. Cloud is a great place
to have a childhood.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.912
Well, so is New York.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.181
(ALL LAUGHING)

11:30.723 --> 11:33.419
What? It is. And we grew up just fine.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.586
And we grew to the proper size,
and then we stopped.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.760
- Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?
- Oh, that's for me.

11:45.871 --> 11:50.069
- You can put it in my car.
- In your car. Then you'll take it...

11:50.443 --> 11:53.970
Home. Yeah, we get so much extra food,
no one can eat it all.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.374
Oh, truffle oil. Score.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.711
But people donated this food
thinking it was going to feed the hungry.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.381
I know. And I'm starving.

12:07.827 --> 12:11.661
- But, Marshall, you love New York.
- Yes, I do.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.497
But you always said
that when we had kids,

12:13.599 --> 12:17.467
- you wanted to move out of Manhattan.
- Well, yeah, to Brooklyn.

12:18.237 --> 12:22.264
Why are we even talking about this?
This is, like, way down the road.

12:22.374 --> 12:26.572
<i>OLDER TED; But Lily knew "way down the</i>
<i>road, "might not be so far down the road,</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:31.581
- I need to go to the restroom.
- Lily, the restroom's the other way.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.379
<i>So, she headed down the road,</i>

12:34.253 --> 12:36.983
Lily? Lily!

12:42.328 --> 12:45.297
So, wait. Not only have you not done
any good for anyone today,

12:45.397 --> 12:48.059
you're actually helping someone
steal from the homeless?

12:48.167 --> 12:51.398
You know, Ted, it's called
Thanksgiving, not Thanks-taking.

12:51.537 --> 12:52.595
Damn.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.432
Barney, you need me to sign
your time sheet, right?

12:55.541 --> 12:58.977
- BARNEY: Oh, yeah, right. Thanks.
- Barney.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.003
- Yeah, what's up?
- You have a time sheet?

13:02.114 --> 13:04.446
- No one else has a time sheet.
- Yeah, so?

13:04.550 --> 13:05.710
All right, let me see that. Come on.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.786
Hey, that's my private, personal business.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.617
"Court-mandated community service?"

13:10.723 --> 13:13.851
Oh, my God, you're on probation?
What did you do?

13:15.094 --> 13:17.358
That's my private, personal business.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.259
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

13:23.836 --> 13:28.239
I was unfairly punished because
the wall belonged to the judge's church.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.899
You peed on a church?

13:31.010 --> 13:33.638
I peed in an alley,
which happened to have a church,

13:33.746 --> 13:36.544
which I did not see, because I was drunk.

13:37.516 --> 13:41.748
- You are evil.
- All is right with the world again.

13:41.887 --> 13:42.911
Okay, fine.

13:43.022 --> 13:46.219
So a judge is making me do this,
but I'm still doing it.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.919
And kicking ass at it, BTW.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.327
When's the last time
either of you did something good, huh?

13:56.769 --> 13:58.327
Kendall. Kendall.

13:59.004 --> 14:03.168
Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms
from homeless people.

14:04.243 --> 14:08.202
Amanda. I called dibs
on the Portobello mushrooms.

14:09.648 --> 14:13.311
- Those are for the hungry.
- I know. And I'm starving.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.414
(BOTH LAUGHING)

14:19.558 --> 14:21.082
AMANDA: Those are good mushrooms!

14:21.193 --> 14:24.128
Mushrooms! Mushrooms!
Portobello mushrooms for everyone!

14:24.263 --> 14:27.460
Take them and run!
They're very expensive!

14:32.471 --> 14:35.702
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving?

14:35.908 --> 14:38.536
As in, "Check out the chick buying
the knock-up test, everybody,

14:38.644 --> 14:40.509
"wonder what must be going
through her head."

14:40.613 --> 14:44.709
Yeah, well, since you asked,
a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants

14:44.817 --> 14:47.752
is trying to suck me
into their suburban nightmare,

14:47.853 --> 14:50.219
and there's a solid chance
that I have an Eriksen,

14:50.322 --> 14:54.088
the size of a 15-pound turkey,
growing inside of me!

14:55.661 --> 14:59.688
You know the Eriksens?
You're Marshall's fiancée.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.358
- Fantastic.
- So nice to meet you.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.630
You're taller than described.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.497
Oh, I'm sorry I just yelled at you.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.502
- You mind if I use your bathroom?
- Don't have one.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.772
- So what do you do when you have to...
- I hold it.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.872
(SLURPING)

15:22.488 --> 15:26.390
- You can't fire a volunteer.
- Apparently you can.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.390
And his two
non-mushroom-throwing friends.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.897
I can't believe I told Kendall
you guys were cool.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.827
I have 40 hours left
on my community service.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.769
And now I've gotta spend it
spearing trash on a freaking median strip.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.466
Volunteer of the Year!

15:45.577 --> 15:47.374
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay?

15:47.479 --> 15:49.811
Look, if there's anything I can do
to make it up to you,

15:49.915 --> 15:52.315
- just tell me, I'll do it.
- Ted, I'm glad you asked.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.658
- Surprisingly good.
- Right? I told you so.

16:05.064 --> 16:08.591
Public urination.
Who gets arrested for public urination?

16:09.168 --> 16:12.296
- Lily's been arrested.
- Oh, dear. What for?

16:13.906 --> 16:15.430
Public urination.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.483
- Thanks, Pete.
- No problemo, Marsh.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.288
- You all right?
- No.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.585
I embarrassed myself
in front of your family,

16:33.692 --> 16:37.856
and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in
probably the most depressing place ever.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.297
Well, I'm glad that you're safe.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.594
Hey, weird question.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.865
Why did you drive 3 miles down Route 23

16:47.973 --> 16:49.838
and take a pee
behind a convenience store?

16:49.942 --> 16:52.001
Okay, I'll tell you, but before I do,

16:52.111 --> 16:55.638
promise me that we are not gonna move
to St. Cloud, Minnesota. Promise.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.739
Look it, I'm not suggesting
that we move here tomorrow,

16:57.883 --> 16:59.043
- I'm just...
- Just promise!

16:59.151 --> 17:00.743
Why do you want me to promise you that?

17:00.853 --> 17:03.617
Because I don't fit in here.
I'm not 8 feet tall,

17:03.722 --> 17:07.157
and I don't think you can call it a salad
if it has Funyuns in it!

17:08.093 --> 17:09.458
I'm Funyuns.

17:09.928 --> 17:14.297
And mayonnaise, and Gummi Bears,
and bask-ice-ball, and I love St. Cloud.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.231
And yes, there is a part of me
that would like to move here someday.

17:17.336 --> 17:21.534
And why are we having this discussion
in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?

17:22.241 --> 17:26.609
Okay, personal effects.
One wallet, one cell phone,

17:27.546 --> 17:29.309
one pregnancy test.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.357
Pete arrested me before I could look at it.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.195
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.336
Lily, we can't let our kids play
bask-ice-ball.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.469
Bask-ice-ball is really dangerous.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.568
Yeah, what are the rules
to that game, anyway?

18:00.679 --> 18:03.341
There are no rules.
We just whale on each other.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.014
Look, I don't wanna be
exactly like my family.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.358
And don't take this the wrong way,

18:15.994 --> 18:19.395
but I don't wanna be
exactly like your family, either.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.800
We'll be our own family.

18:22.968 --> 18:27.871
And we'll find our own way to
freak out the people our kids bring home.

18:31.376 --> 18:33.207
Great, now I'm crying.

18:33.645 --> 18:37.274
Look, we may have some really
big decisions to make

18:37.382 --> 18:39.145
in about 10 seconds,

18:39.785 --> 18:42.219
but right now,
I don't care where our kids grow up,

18:42.321 --> 18:44.687
as long as they have you for a father.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.795
Gosh, I hope you're the father.

18:50.896 --> 18:54.093
Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.596
What does it say?

19:01.540 --> 19:04.475
- I'm afraid to look.
- PETE: It's negative!

19:05.911 --> 19:07.970
Oh, thank God.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.611
And, hey!

19:13.285 --> 19:15.776
Ted, are you listening?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.286
You're a good guy.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.358
Wanna know
why I have to work tomorrow?

19:20.459 --> 19:23.724
My firm's designing an executive lounge
for a tobacco company.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.265
In the fight against cancer,
I'm on the side of cancer.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.468
Okay, Ted. I found a way
for you to help someone, to do some good.

19:30.569 --> 19:33.037
This is Walter. Walter is homeless.

19:33.138 --> 19:36.835
- And Walter would like a lap dance.
- Are you joking?

19:36.975 --> 19:40.775
I never joke about the sublime art
of burlesque entertainment.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.543
No, Barney, that's insane.

19:43.649 --> 19:47.176
Sir, would you like me to buy you
a ticket to the buffet?

19:47.286 --> 19:49.948
No, I'm stuffed.
Just the lap dance would be fine.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.990
Ted, Walter's been
to three shelter dinners.

19:53.091 --> 19:56.583
You know where he hasn't been?
To heaven with Samantha.

19:58.597 --> 20:01.725
Look, it's the one chance you've had
all day to help someone in need.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.994
Now, buy this man a lap dance.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.065
You said you wanted to see the look of joy
in someone's eyes.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.270
You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.

20:12.911 --> 20:16.608
Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.042
Thank you so much. No, really. Thank you.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.225
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.489
Thanksgiving in November. Weird.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.964
<i>OLDER TED; So,</i>
<i>that was Thanksgiving 2005,</i>

20:42.107 --> 20:46.066

<i>But life has plenty of good parts,</i>

20:46.311 --> 20:50.179
<i>It's the rough parts that make you thankful</i>
<i>you have people to share it with,</i>

21:08.333 --> 21:12.133
Hey, I saw what you did for that guy.
It was really sweet.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.003
- Do you want a dance?
- No, thanks.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.600
- Do you want some yams?
- No, thanks.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.804
- I'm Amber.
- I'm Ted.

21:23.749 --> 21:26.047
Actually, I'm Tracey.

21:27.586 --> 21:28.883
Still Ted.
