00:12.033 --> 00:15.200
Narrator: Coming up -- what's
got Joe hitting the bottle?

00:17.700 --> 00:21.800
Why is Murr having
a brief encounter?

00:23.333 --> 00:26.000
And which losing joker
will be caught in a cat fight

00:26.000 --> 00:27.467
in tonight's big punishment?

00:30.500 --> 00:33.333
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.400
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:36.100 --> 00:37.733
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:39.533 --> 00:42.267
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:42.267 --> 00:44.300
Joe: Larry!

00:48.067 --> 00:49.933
Today, we are posing
as trainees

00:49.933 --> 00:51.633
in Organic Avenue
in Chelsea.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.833
While learning
the job,

00:52.833 --> 00:54.700
we'll have to do and say
what the other guys tell us.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.133
At the end
of the training session,

00:56.133 --> 00:58.067
we'll have the trainer rank us
on a scale of 1 to 10.

00:58.067 --> 00:59.700
Whoever gets
the lowest ranking loses.

01:01.300 --> 01:04.100
Joe: You want
to give them a minute?

01:05.600 --> 01:07.500
This is James.
Hi.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.933
James,
this is Melissa.

01:08.933 --> 01:10.633
None of the employees know
that we are working here today.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.067
Only the manager knows.
She's in on it.

01:12.067 --> 01:13.100
She's gonna help us out.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.267
I'm gonna be
in back, okay?

01:14.267 --> 01:15.367
Gotcha.
Thank you.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.833
All right, Murr,
good luck on your new job.

01:16.833 --> 01:17.867
This is exciting.

01:17.867 --> 01:18.967
My first day --
I'm very excited.

01:18.967 --> 01:20.267
Q:
Somebody's walking in.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.733
Murr, tell them you're closed
for training, buddy.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.267
I'm sorry,
we're closed for training.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.367
We're closed for training.
I'm sorry.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.300
We're closed for training.
I'm training. I'm new.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.600
We're closed.
I'm sorry.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.800
**

01:30.800 --> 01:32.167
Thank you.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.500
Should I
do that, too?

01:35.500 --> 01:37.167
I guess.

01:37.167 --> 01:38.533
I don't know.
Okay.

01:38.533 --> 01:39.933
Did you
take the subway, too?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.067
Did you
take the subway, too?

01:41.067 --> 01:42.100
Yeah, I did.
You did.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.467
I should wash my mouth,
then, too.

01:43.467 --> 01:45.500
So, I sho--

01:45.500 --> 01:48.333
I should really
wash my mouth, too.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.433
Hold on.

01:54.567 --> 01:55.700
Okay.
This is organic?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.767
This is organic?
Yes.

01:57.767 --> 01:59.300
I got to bring this home
to my wife.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.533
This is great.

02:00.533 --> 02:02.067
I have to -- I have to
bring this home to my wife.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.867
She says I never bring her
to an organic.

02:03.867 --> 02:05.100
She -- she s--

02:06.200 --> 02:09.100
My wife says
I never bring her to --

02:09.100 --> 02:11.367
Look at him, he's losing
it out there. What's
the matter with you?

02:11.367 --> 02:13.867
My wife says I never
bring her to an organic.

02:14.833 --> 02:15.833
Yeah.

02:16.933 --> 02:18.700
Okay, so let's say
a customer walks in.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.067
Let's say, for example,
a customer walks in, all right?

02:21.067 --> 02:22.467
Play out
what a customer would do.

02:22.467 --> 02:23.733
So, a customer
walks in --

02:23.733 --> 02:25.333
you know, let's say
he's got, like, a moustache.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.667
And he comes up to me
and he's, like...

02:26.667 --> 02:27.867
"What's the best
for me?"

02:27.867 --> 02:29.900
"Hey,
what's the best tea for me?"

02:31.567 --> 02:33.500
And
I'm like, "Well, sir,
we have many options.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.767
The most popular one
is the Green Energy."

02:34.767 --> 02:35.800
Go over
and do his wife.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.433
His wife is here,
and she's like,

02:37.433 --> 02:40.467
"But I don't like bananas."

02:41.833 --> 02:43.467
Make him get in a fight
about how he doesn't know her.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.133
She's like,
"I can't believe you thought

02:45.133 --> 02:46.200
I would like bananas."

02:46.200 --> 02:47.967
"Well
damn it, bitch!"

02:47.967 --> 02:50.267
"But come on,

02:50.267 --> 02:52.167
you promise me
an organic, Roger."

02:52.167 --> 02:54.933
He's like,
"Oh, she got me there."

02:54.933 --> 02:56.400
Okay.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.633
What are
the different settings for?
So...

02:59.633 --> 03:01.567
Scream when
she turns it on.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.933
The screen...

03:05.700 --> 03:07.533
Sorry,
I just have PTSD.

03:07.533 --> 03:09.900
I have to apologize. I have
a little bit of, like, PTSD.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.333
From the time I --
I was in a blender.

03:13.433 --> 03:15.467
From the time I --

03:15.467 --> 03:17.267
from the time
I was in a blender.

03:17.267 --> 03:19.200
Oh.
Yeah.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.800
Wow.
I'm sorry.

03:23.067 --> 03:25.267
Uh-oh,
quick piss.

03:25.267 --> 03:27.833
Uh-oh,
quick piss.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.933
**

03:33.933 --> 03:36.833
Now we're gonna send in
the manager to ask how Murr did.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.500
How's it going?
So, how's he doing?

03:39.500 --> 03:40.867
Like, 1 to 10.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.633
That's amazing.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.267
Still too good.
I'll take it.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.500
I'll take it.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.100
You got to be kidding.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.267
So, what we're gonna make today
is a Green Protein.

03:50.267 --> 03:51.933
Good.
I'm excited for this job.

03:51.933 --> 03:54.733
Sal, have a stupid face when
you concentrate on something.

03:57.067 --> 03:59.233
So, like...

03:59.233 --> 04:00.767
**

04:00.767 --> 04:02.633
Look at his face.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.967
Am I doing it right?

04:05.967 --> 04:07.167
Yeah, yeah.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.967
Blueberries,
strawberries, bananas.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.267
Okay.
All right.

04:13.267 --> 04:14.533
Toss it in.

04:14.533 --> 04:15.733
Concentrate, concentrate.
Concentrate. Look at him.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.433
**

04:19.667 --> 04:21.167
Look -- look at him,
look at him.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.400
So, you want me to pour this
into the bowl?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
Yeah.
Okay.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.567
Look at him.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.333
Hey, how you doing,
sir?

04:36.333 --> 04:38.400
Welcome to Organic
Market. If you eat meat,
get the  out.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.767
Welcome to
Organic Market.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.567
If you eat beef,
get the  out.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.367
Shoot the look,
shoot the look.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.700
Oh, hi.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.867
You're from
the building?

04:54.867 --> 04:55.867
Yeah.
Oh, okay.

04:56.867 --> 04:58.433
That's the landlord.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.133
Now we're gonna make
a bowl.
Q:
Quick question --

05:03.133 --> 05:04.767
how do you know who's an
employee and who's a customer?

05:04.767 --> 05:06.333
How do you...

05:07.833 --> 05:11.600
...discern who's an employee
and who's a customer?

05:12.633 --> 05:14.167
Oh, the uniform.

05:14.167 --> 05:15.167
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.600
Okay, the next thing I was gonna
train you on was the register.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.700
So, we have a bit where
we're working behind the counter

05:20.700 --> 05:22.700
and somebody comes in
and throws water in your face.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.900
This is not
that bit.
But we're gonna
do it anyway.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.433
Watch what you're doing.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.800
This is not that bit.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.367
Joe: Have the face
as you're going to get the mop.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.200
Keep it together,
keep it together!

05:53.200 --> 05:55.200
**

05:59.900 --> 06:02.200
Here we go,
here we go.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.133
So, how you doing?
Let's see
what he got.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.867
Scale of 1 to 10.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.300
**

06:11.067 --> 06:12.133
3.

06:12.133 --> 06:13.867
Q:
A three.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.167
What do you think's
the most important...

06:21.933 --> 06:23.500
So, you worked
at the other location?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.300
So, you worked
at the Bleecker location,

06:25.300 --> 06:26.433
the other one?

06:26.433 --> 06:28.067
What's their security system
like there?

06:28.067 --> 06:29.067
They got cameras?

06:30.067 --> 06:31.633
Over in that one,
what's the, uh --

06:31.633 --> 06:33.767
what's, like, the security
system like over there?

06:33.767 --> 06:35.200
They have cameras?

06:36.133 --> 06:37.500
They do.
They do.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.700
Always.
Always gloves.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.733
Gloves, yes.

06:41.733 --> 06:43.100
Right, you don't want
to leave prints.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.400
Yeah.
You don't want germs,

06:44.400 --> 06:45.900
you don't want to leave prints,
nothing like that.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.933
Sal: Do you think
the security codes

06:47.933 --> 06:49.667
are the same
between both stores?

06:49.667 --> 06:51.900
Like, the codes and everything
like that -- the same thing --

06:51.900 --> 06:53.700
they're all the same
in all the stores, right?

06:54.733 --> 06:55.967
Yeah.
We'll find out.

06:55.967 --> 06:57.933
I guess we'll f--

06:59.433 --> 07:01.167
I guess
we'll find out.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.433
On average, how much cash
is there in the drawer

07:07.433 --> 07:08.733
at the end
of the night?

07:08.733 --> 07:10.167
On average...

07:10.167 --> 07:12.133
...how much cash
is there in the drawer

07:12.133 --> 07:13.500
at the end
of the night?

07:15.067 --> 07:16.433
I'm just gonna
shoot you straight --

07:16.433 --> 07:17.833
I'm looking
to rob this place blind.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.567
I'm just gonna
shoot you straight --

07:20.567 --> 07:22.567
I'm looking
to rob this place blind.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.533
Sal: She doesn't know
what to make of it.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.100
So, these are
the juices.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.500
Q: Got it.
They're right over here.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.633
Could you just show me,
like, what...

07:32.633 --> 07:34.200
Like,
if people ask,

07:34.200 --> 07:35.333
I don't even know
what's over here.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.400
That's -- that's --

07:37.400 --> 07:40.367
Brussels sprouts
and

07:40.367 --> 07:42.233
Joe: Shitake!

07:42.233 --> 07:44.200
Murr: Shitake.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.333
That was actually
Q reading that.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.500
It's shitake!
It's shitake mushrooms.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.267
Oh, man, I never had
-take before.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.500
It looks all right.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.700
Speaking of -take,
I'll be right back.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.833
Speaking of -take,
I'll be right back.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.933
Pop out disheveled.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.600
Help.
Help.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.933
How's it going?

08:12.933 --> 08:16.767
Like, on a scale of 1 to 10,
what would you say?

08:17.867 --> 08:19.067
6!
6!

08:19.067 --> 08:21.200
Yeah!

08:21.200 --> 08:22.867
So, now which one
are we making, the...

08:22.867 --> 08:25.067
Green Energy smoothie.

08:25.067 --> 08:27.233
Drink the coconut water.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.633
That smells good.

08:29.633 --> 08:31.600
**

08:33.633 --> 08:34.833
Murr:
Take another one.

08:34.833 --> 08:35.900
You can't stop.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.167
You're addicted.
You're addicted.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.400
Do it again.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.700
**

08:48.333 --> 08:50.067
It's delicious.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.400
He's now ruined
two full bottles of milk.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.867
See, it says 12 ounces,
specifically...
Got it.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.667
...it'll say half a scoop of
which fruit specifically to...

08:57.667 --> 08:59.900
Cool, cool.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.867
Don't drink.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.233
The hardest thing for me
to remember is,

09:04.233 --> 09:05.533
don't drink
directly from the bottle.

09:05.533 --> 09:06.733
**

09:06.733 --> 09:08.800
You need another taste
of that sweet nectar.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.900
**

09:09.900 --> 09:11.900
How's that?

09:11.900 --> 09:13.167
Good?

09:16.367 --> 09:18.100
That's better.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.800
That tastes better.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.433
Get your cup ready.
Get my cup ready.

09:24.467 --> 09:26.433
Q: Joe, you've never seen
a cup sleeve before.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.533
Let go.

09:31.533 --> 09:33.500
I got it.
I know.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.100
I'm just doing it
on my own,

09:35.100 --> 09:36.300
'cause I have to learn.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.767
I'm just trying
to make sure it's in.

09:42.267 --> 09:43.267
So, I just
take this out?
You open it.

09:43.267 --> 09:44.400
Sal:
Do a trick and say,

09:44.400 --> 09:45.867
"I feel like Tom Cruise
in 'Cocktail.'"

09:46.900 --> 09:49.267
Whoo, see that?

09:49.267 --> 09:50.767
Oh, you don't want
to spill?

09:50.767 --> 09:51.933
I won't spill.
I'm good like that.

09:51.933 --> 09:52.967
I'm Tom Cruise
in "Cocktail."

09:52.967 --> 09:54.567
I hope Gina Gershon
parks her ass

09:54.567 --> 09:56.833
at the end of the counter
and I get to  her.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.300
**

09:58.300 --> 09:59.867
Hit me
with that Gina Gershon.

10:05.867 --> 10:07.167
Say it!

10:07.167 --> 10:09.333
Hopefully,
Gina Gershon comes over here,

10:09.333 --> 10:12.500
puts her ass down,
and I get to  her.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.933
Murr: Joe, you got to drink
a little more milk.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.667
Here he goes.
Here he goes.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.667
She's coming back.
She's coming back.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.233
Oh, oh, oh.

10:30.233 --> 10:31.367
Mm.

10:35.733 --> 10:37.333
I should go wash my hands,
actually.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.433
Sal:
She keeps scolding him.

10:40.433 --> 10:41.767
Murr:
Look at her face.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.733
She has had it,
dealing with this guy.

10:43.733 --> 10:45.233
She's in
a catatonic state.

10:46.233 --> 10:47.867
All right,
let's send in the manager.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.100
What's going on?

10:50.133 --> 10:51.533
You're getting
a ing...

10:51.533 --> 10:52.533
Negative three.

10:52.533 --> 10:55.567
From 1 to 10,
how do you think he did?

10:55.567 --> 10:56.767
A 5.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.633
5!

10:59.633 --> 11:01.533
You've got
to be ing me.

11:01.533 --> 11:03.367
Narrator: Sal wasn't
employee of the month,

11:03.367 --> 11:06.067
but his photo will be displayed
on the loser board.

11:06.067 --> 11:08.067
Today, we'll have to
get a stranger

11:08.067 --> 11:10.533
to help us untangle
these headphones

11:10.533 --> 11:14.233
before a secret guest gets to us
and rips our pants off

11:14.233 --> 11:16.300
right in the middle
of the mall.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.700
What?
Yep.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.667
If the stranger gets your
headphones untangled in time,

11:19.667 --> 11:20.800
you're safe.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.567
If they can't get them
untangled in time,

11:22.567 --> 11:24.967
your pants get ripped off
right in the middle of the mall.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.200
What?

11:27.233 --> 11:28.867
It's a pants party.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.167
Joe:
So, Sal's put on

11:33.167 --> 11:34.900
the trademarked "Impractical
Jokers" breakaway pants.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.200
Yes.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.433
Dude, there's no way
to get these things untangled.

11:38.433 --> 11:40.633
Murr: Choose somebody carefully
to untangle those.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.967
Your pants
are in their hands.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.233
Or your pants are gonna be
in someone's hands.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.133
Excuse me,
dude.

11:45.133 --> 11:47.433
I need to untangle these things.
I can't do it.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.333
Do you feel like
you can untangle them?

11:50.333 --> 11:51.800
Thank you so much.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.967
Here he comes.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.800
Q: Here we go,
here we go.

11:55.933 --> 11:57.833
It's Bully Ray.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.667
Bully Ray is a legendary
professional wrestler

12:02.667 --> 12:05.067
who almost beat the crap
out of Sal 15 years ago

12:05.067 --> 12:07.333
in a parking lot at a wrestling
event when Sal insulted him.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.500
If you could just --

12:08.500 --> 12:10.233
if you could just hurry up
and get them untangled.

12:10.233 --> 12:11.333
Bully Ray.

12:11.333 --> 12:12.367
Okay,
that's good.

12:12.367 --> 12:13.867
No, don't give them
back to me!

12:13.867 --> 12:15.300
What is he doing?

12:15.300 --> 12:18.167
Why are you
giving them back to me?

12:18.167 --> 12:20.533
Can someone
untangle these?

12:31.233 --> 12:33.333
Murr: Look at this guy --
He's got no pants on.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.567
Murr: Q.
Yeah?

12:37.567 --> 12:39.667
Choose your ally
very carefully.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.067
Murr, there's no shot.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.100
You just need, you know,
someone that's dexterous.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.467
Shut up.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.400
Stop saying -- that's the third
time you've said "dexterous."

12:47.400 --> 12:48.400
It seems like
the right fit.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.833
He just
wants everybody to know

12:49.833 --> 12:51.200
that he knows
the word "dexterous."
I learned it.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.733
Do you think you could take a
shot at untangling these for me?

12:54.267 --> 12:56.067
Oh, yeah?
Cool. Thanks.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.467
All right,
let's do this.

12:58.533 --> 13:01.567
Oh, my God, no.
It's Tommy Dreamer.

13:01.567 --> 13:02.667
Oh, man.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.400
This guy banged me up a lot
last time.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.400
You got them.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.667
Oh, you're so close.
Oh, man. Come on, please.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.567
Oh, man, come on.

13:14.567 --> 13:16.067
Dude, I thought
we were friends.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.833
I thought --

13:17.833 --> 13:19.167
How you doing?

13:20.367 --> 13:21.800
Please don't
hurt me again.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.400
Please don't
hurt me again.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.067
You weren't supposed to
pull my  out, dude.

13:31.067 --> 13:32.700
We're gonna get arrested.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.933
Murr:
Oh, my God.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.067
That's what
I was afraid of.

13:42.733 --> 13:45.733
Dude, are you good
with untangling these things?

13:45.733 --> 13:47.800
I've been trying
for like 10 minutes.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.400
I have made
no progress whatsoever.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.600
Can you
give me a hand?

13:51.600 --> 13:52.900
And here we go.
And...

13:52.900 --> 13:54.433
Ready?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.200
Go, go, go!
Come on, come on, come on.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.567
Sal:
Here she comes.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.600
We have Velvet Sky --

13:59.600 --> 14:03.467
former TNA women's
knockout champion, Velvet Sky.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.433
Who's actually walking
much more briskly

14:05.433 --> 14:06.600
than the two of you did.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.967
It's...

14:07.967 --> 14:09.267
Q:
She's walking too fast.

14:09.267 --> 14:11.367
You boys ready for some
hot girl

14:13.133 --> 14:14.267
You get that end,
I'll get this end.

14:14.267 --> 14:16.600
Walk with me, walk with me,
walk with me.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.300
Hi. Hi.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.567
He's done.
He's done.

14:23.567 --> 14:25.067
Hi.
No, no!

14:30.767 --> 14:32.600
He's got
women's underwear on.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.800
Yeah,
I wore my panties.

14:37.867 --> 14:40.533
Put your pants on.
It's over.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.467
Guys, I got a problem.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.300
Oh, they're all tangled.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.233
What an issue.
Excuse me.

14:49.233 --> 14:50.833
Yeah, you,
come here a second.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.233
She's coming.
She's coming.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.767
He called her
out of the store.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.200
60, 70 feet away.
Unbelievable.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.433
Joe:
This is what happened --

14:56.433 --> 14:58.533
I had the red and the blue ones,
and they got tangled.

14:58.533 --> 15:00.833
You look like you're good
with wires.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.500
We downshifted
a little bit.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.267
Murr:
Here comes Luke.

15:07.267 --> 15:09.667
Yeah, I've been doing
some shop-- oh, God.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.767
Remember the challenge where
we get people to watch our son?

15:11.767 --> 15:12.767
That's Luke.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.067
He's gunning it.
He's gunning it.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.700
Q:
Cute little kid.
He's gunning it, though.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.200
Oh, you're close.
Go ahead, you got it.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.067
Keep to it --
oh, this little bastard.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.867
Hey, buddy, how are you?
How you doing, man?

15:22.867 --> 15:25.167
How you doing, buddy?
How's it going?

15:25.167 --> 15:26.167
Go ahead.

15:26.167 --> 15:27.933
Keep working,
keep working.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.933
Go ahead, do it, come on!
Put your heart into it.

15:31.933 --> 15:33.133
Murr:
This doesn't look right.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.233
He's got --

15:34.233 --> 15:37.067
Put your heart into it.
Come on!

15:45.267 --> 15:48.067
Didn't get it.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.767
Narrator: No one
could keep their pants on,

15:49.767 --> 15:52.667
which means Sal
is tonight's big loser.

15:52.667 --> 15:53.700
Okay,
here we go.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.167
Joe, would you
do the honors?

15:55.167 --> 15:56.667
Okay, ready, bud?
Here we go.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.067
Okay, ready?
One, two...

15:58.067 --> 16:00.200
Q: Does this place
look familiar at all?

16:02.900 --> 16:04.367
Soak it in,
buddy.

16:06.567 --> 16:07.900
Now,
do you remember

16:07.900 --> 16:10.400
when you dropped tarantulas
on me, my friend?

16:10.400 --> 16:11.867
We all did.

16:11.867 --> 16:13.300
You seemed
to enjoy it

16:13.300 --> 16:15.700
just a little bit more
than everybody else.

16:15.700 --> 16:16.833
Don't come near.

16:16.833 --> 16:17.833
No -- pumpernickel,
pumpernickel.

16:17.833 --> 16:19.333
Pumpernickel! Stop!

16:19.333 --> 16:21.333
You're a grown man

16:21.333 --> 16:23.833
screaming "pumpernickel"
in a warehouse.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.200
Instead of covering you
with tarantulas,

16:27.200 --> 16:29.333
we're gonna cover you
with kitty cats.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.067
No, you're not.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.067
Oh, yeah, we are.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.833
Oh, yeah --
and don't worry, buddy.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.967
If you start panicking,
just say, "Whole wheat."

16:35.967 --> 16:37.333
You just say,
"Whole wheat."

16:37.333 --> 16:38.567
It's a safe word,
buddy.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.067
Tarantulas cannot attack you
like a cat can.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.133
They can't attack you
that swiftly.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.833
They can't bite you,
they can't scratch you.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.100
Of course
they can bite you!

16:46.100 --> 16:47.433
Knock, knock.

16:47.433 --> 16:49.567
Who's there?
Catnip.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.900
Oh, I do not like this.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.067
**

16:57.067 --> 16:58.167
Q:
Let's get this started.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.500
Sal: And the punishment
begins...

16:59.500 --> 17:00.700
All: ...now.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.133
Okay,
let's bring them in.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.500
What is that?

17:07.467 --> 17:09.733
Murr:
There they are.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.100
Oh
is that?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.300
Q: Those are
five-week old kittens, buddy.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.633
Aww,
they're adorable.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.500
Oh, God,
that looks like it was...

17:21.267 --> 17:24.167
Oh, it's meowing.

17:27.533 --> 17:29.333
One more!
Bring him one more!

17:29.333 --> 17:30.633
Murr:
One more cat.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.633
face off.

17:34.100 --> 17:37.500
There you go, buddy.
You survived phase one.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.533
All right,
let's take out the kittens.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.233
Bring in
the next phase of life.

17:41.233 --> 17:42.367
Phase of life?

17:42.367 --> 17:44.633
There's one other phase --
kittens, cats.

17:44.633 --> 17:46.767
Here we go,
bud.

17:51.933 --> 17:54.567
Oh, my God.

17:54.567 --> 17:55.567
Joe:
Those are cats!

17:55.567 --> 17:56.800
Guys,
I can't do it.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.400
Wait, wait, before you do it --
wait, wait, wait!

17:59.400 --> 18:01.467
Wait.
Please -- whole wheat, please.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.433
Before you do it,
can you just tell them -- guys.

18:03.433 --> 18:04.433
Oh, my God.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.733
He's scared of kittens.

18:06.733 --> 18:09.233
Here's cat number one.

18:13.633 --> 18:16.100
There's another one.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.933
Two cats!

18:17.933 --> 18:19.600
Can they sense my fear?

18:23.067 --> 18:24.767
Oh.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.767
You looked less scared when
there was a tarantula on you.

18:30.767 --> 18:31.967
I know.
This is crazy.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.767
Oh, my

18:37.167 --> 18:39.233
My balls.

18:40.267 --> 18:42.900
I can't do this.

18:42.900 --> 18:46.333
I'm afraid they're gonna sense
how afraid I am.

18:46.333 --> 18:50.067
Oh, my God.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.500
Please, stop, they're fighting.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.200
Whole wheat.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.267
Q:
Did you say, "Whole wheat"?

19:02.267 --> 19:03.667
I couldn't hear
what you said.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.800
The cat's sitting on your mike.
We can't hear you.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.800
Whole wheat.
I'm saying, "Whole wheat."

19:08.800 --> 19:11.400
You're 40 years old saying,
"Whole wheat" in a warehouse.

19:15.833 --> 19:18.400
Okay,
phase three.

19:20.433 --> 19:22.067
Oh, what is that?

19:22.067 --> 19:23.533
That's a steak.

19:23.533 --> 19:26.133
Q: That's a steak.
No. No.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.800
You've got Plexiglass
around you.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.267
Is that
to keep things in?

19:29.267 --> 19:30.400
Or to keep things out?

19:33.067 --> 19:34.467
What is that?

19:34.467 --> 19:36.567
What is that? Please.

19:38.467 --> 19:40.467
Don't --
oh, you ing asshole.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.967
Let's get the last cat
in here.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.933
The biggest and best cat
that we know.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.900
Please, don't -- don't, please.

19:49.900 --> 19:50.900
If this is a tiger,

19:50.900 --> 19:52.367
do not let it
get in this thing, please.

19:52.367 --> 19:53.700
You don't know
what these things --

19:53.700 --> 19:55.133
they're trained --
you don't even know.

19:55.133 --> 19:56.200
Look what happened
to Roy.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.633
Here we go,
the biggest cat of all.

19:59.633 --> 20:00.733
Murr: Uh-oh.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.067
My favorite cat.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.600
Uh-oh!

20:06.167 --> 20:08.400
cat.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.200
I hate
this ing cat.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.300
This cat
keeps coming back.

20:15.367 --> 20:16.700
And...

20:16.700 --> 20:19.533
Joe:
There you go, yeah!

20:21.000 --> 20:23.600
Hump, Benjamin.
Benjamin, hump.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.867
This is where Sal Vulcano
was just punished,

20:30.867 --> 20:32.333
and now we're gonna give you

20:32.333 --> 20:34.700
an exclusive, behind-the-scenes
look of how it all happened.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.167
I'm also gonna show you
some bonus content

20:36.167 --> 20:37.367
from tonight's episode.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.900
So, what are you doing,
making sure the cage is good?

20:40.900 --> 20:43.667
I am making sure that we are
ready to go to punish Sal.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.733
And right now,
I'm looking at the cage.

20:45.733 --> 20:47.567
You look like a kid
on Christmas.

20:47.567 --> 20:48.700
I'm very excited.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.167
Oh, my God.

20:52.267 --> 20:54.233
What's interesting
is that he was in this building

20:54.233 --> 20:55.233
not too long ago.

20:55.233 --> 20:56.333
What's racing
through his mind?

20:56.333 --> 20:57.667
I feel like the suspense
is killing him.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.267
Well, we've done a bunch of them
in this building,

20:59.267 --> 21:00.533
so that's kind of
throwing him off.

21:00.533 --> 21:01.867
So, even when he comes
to this building,

21:01.867 --> 21:03.067
he won't know,
'cause we did --

21:03.067 --> 21:04.500
I wrestled Byamba next door,
the sumo wrestler.

21:08.733 --> 21:10.433
You know, Q's tarantula,
of course.

21:12.067 --> 21:14.233
Get it off!

21:14.233 --> 21:15.900
You should've had him
wrestle a tarantula.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.300
That would've been it.
Next time.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.233
This is kind of your
brain child, this punishment.

21:19.233 --> 21:22.200
Yeah, this is direct revenge
on Sal for the tarantulas.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.067
Oh, so this is
just the Sal one.

21:24.067 --> 21:26.067
This is --
oh, yeah, they're all --

21:26.067 --> 21:29.900
they're all getting
specific punishments.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.833
Okay, but not necessarily
always tortured?

21:31.833 --> 21:33.067
No, no, no, no, no.

21:33.067 --> 21:36.933
This was just a funny one
'cause I know it'll get Sal.

21:36.933 --> 21:39.900
When I strike,
I will specifically say,

21:39.900 --> 21:40.967
"This is because of
the tarantulas."

21:40.967 --> 21:42.133
Wow.
Yes.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.067
Since when do we do this,
though, by the way?

21:44.067 --> 21:45.567
Nobody else does this.

21:45.567 --> 21:48.600
I'm always the one
that has to be put through

21:48.600 --> 21:49.933
this stupid

21:49.933 --> 21:51.400
They're doing the intro
right now,

21:51.400 --> 21:53.800
and Sal just found out
what his punishment is.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.133
Tarantulas cannot attack you
like a cat can.

21:57.133 --> 21:58.433
He's trying
to convince you

21:58.433 --> 22:00.100
that cats are worse
than tarantulas.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.533
I know!
Is this guy kidding me?

22:01.533 --> 22:03.667
What about my eyes?
Yeah,
you got two of them.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.133
I mean,
it's funny because

22:05.133 --> 22:06.900
he's somehow
trying to convince me

22:06.900 --> 22:09.900
that cats are worse
than tarantulas.

22:09.900 --> 22:12.233
The balls
on this guy.

22:12.233 --> 22:13.700
**

22:13.700 --> 22:14.933
Murr:
Look at him.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.100
What's the point of that?

22:18.133 --> 22:19.833
No, the  extra.
It's done.

22:20.967 --> 22:22.067
I'm not going anywhere.

22:22.067 --> 22:24.067
Well, you don't know
what's gonna join you.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.300
Oh, God.

22:26.300 --> 22:27.567
I swear to God,

22:27.567 --> 22:29.467
I thought you were gonna
bring out a  Bengal.

22:29.467 --> 22:32.967
We're here, moments after
Sal just got punished.

22:32.967 --> 22:34.833
At any point,
are you worried, now,

22:34.833 --> 22:36.733
that he's gonna lose
the fear of cats?

22:36.733 --> 22:38.433
No. Did you see him
out there?

22:38.433 --> 22:40.733
I mean, I agree.
Look at him
right now.

22:40.733 --> 22:42.067
Look at him,
he's soaked.

22:42.067 --> 22:44.433
Well, thank you guys so much.
This has been so fun.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.600
And then, what do you guys,
now, you clean up?

22:46.600 --> 22:47.967
No, we go home.
That's it.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.400
No, no, no, that's it.
You get to clean this mess up.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.100
I have to clean up?

22:52.100 --> 22:53.100
Oh, okay.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.667
**

22:57.133 --> 23:00.100
You were just on
a hidden-camera TV show

23:00.100 --> 23:01.633
called
"Impractical Jokers,"

23:01.633 --> 23:04.267
and I'm so sorry
for lying to you.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.700
She ran away!

23:09.700 --> 23:11.767
Hey!

23:11.767 --> 23:13.333
An 8?
An 8?

23:13.333 --> 23:14.867
What are you,
nuts?

23:14.867 --> 23:16.700
Oh, my God.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.067
Oh, you are a terrible
judge of character, Melissa.

23:19.067 --> 23:21.400
You're awesome.
Thank you for giving me an 8.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.200
Sal: Dude,
what are you doing?

23:23.200 --> 23:25.233
Why are you
giving them back to me?

23:27.200 --> 23:30.233
**
