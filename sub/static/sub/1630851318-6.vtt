A craniotomy could
get rid of it all,

but it'd stop
the blood supply
to the optic nerves,

and she'd still go blind.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.753
An endoscopic
endonasal approach

08:05.886 --> 08:07.487
would avoid those
blood vessels.

60% of her vision.

better than 60%.

It's his patient

Is his job at risk?

Well, no.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.987
Okay.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.522

of his negative reviews
to bring his scores up.

this was Shaun's idea.

He... He didn't even
want me to talk to Salen.

know about it?

you decided to come see me?

and condescending?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.679

on his heart valves,

25:28.060 --> 25:29.862

is no longer an option
for my patient.

supposed to look at

25:32.632 --> 25:33.833

was still an option.
