00:15.515 --> 00:18.143
Stop!

00:18.768 --> 00:19.978
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.781
Harcourt, hand me my gun!

00:33.700 --> 00:34.784
- She knows?
- She was walking around

00:34.868 --> 00:37.120
with Peacemaker's
X-ray vision helmet on.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.623
He's not gonna like that.
He's touchy about his helmets.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.916
What the fuck?

00:51.926 --> 00:52.010
We need to talk.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.639
I figured it out
when a bomb exploded

00:56.723 --> 00:59.601
in Murn's face
and he barely took any damage.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.936
I already knew he had
way more Butterfly knowledge

01:02.020 --> 01:04.481
than what was possible
from our current investigations.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.858
I confronted him. He came clean.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.651
My people came to Earth
because our planet was dying.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.862
Your people? The Butterflies?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.530
The one in Goff,
she's our leader.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.907
- "She"?
- Yes.

01:13.907 --> 01:18.620
- Why "She"?
- Well, she had a vagina.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.165
Aliens got vaginas?
What was her real name?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.584
Unlike humans,
we don't name our genitalia.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.797
No. The one in Goff.
What was her real name?

01:28.797 --> 01:31.508
- You're interrogating me?
- I guess.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.927
You can't pronounce it
with a human tongue.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.096
I suppose it'd be something
like "Eek Stack Ik Ik."

01:37.180 --> 01:38.598
Eek Stack Ik Ik?
Yes.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.435
This shit is getting goofy.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.021
We liked it here. We were gonna
live out our lives.

01:45.021 --> 01:48.525
But then Goff
and the others started planning.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.193
- For what?
- How to dominate your world.

01:50.193 --> 01:54.072
I was the sole dissenter.
They said I was oversensitive.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.031
You're oversensitive?

01:55.031 --> 01:59.077
That's when
they started leeching.

01:59.077 --> 02:03.039
Using humans in positions
of power as hosts.

02:03.039 --> 02:06.000
You took over someone?
Yes.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.212
Yeah, you killed someone,
whoever Murn really was!

02:09.212 --> 02:11.047
I needed to stop them!

02:12.632 --> 02:15.385
So I inhabited the worst person
I could find.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.094
This man, Leota, he's...

02:19.472 --> 02:20.348
he's a murderer.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.104
But still,
I know his thoughts. He's...

02:29.858 --> 02:32.652
Even he could have changed.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.239
I know that.
I took that from him.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.243
I took his freedom and his face.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.288
And every day, I dread waking up
to his memories.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.127
- Does Economos know?
- He knows.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.255
But he sticks his fingers
in his ears

02:52.255 --> 02:53.464
every time it comes up.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.507
He doesn't want Waller knowing
he's keeping something from her.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.759
She doesn't know?

02:56.843 --> 02:59.137
- No. And you can't tell her.
- Why?

02:59.137 --> 03:02.599
I told you a long time ago
you can't trust Waller.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.434
We can't risk
anything going wrong.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.269
We have to stop them.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.896
Now that we attacked
the bottling company,

03:07.896 --> 03:09.272
they'll know
we're on their trail.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.691
And we need to be sure
they don't move the cow

03:11.691 --> 03:12.775
- before we find it.
- The cow?

03:12.859 --> 03:15.361
Yes.
- What cow?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.448
You forgot to tell her
about the cow.

where it's coming from
for it to help us.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.395
Let me check something out.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.824
We're gonna approach
with caution,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.409
surround the trailer,
and enter easy.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.578
Peacemaker is a trained killer.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.456
Do not hesitate to shoot him
if he shows resistance.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.842
Come in, Adrian!

12:01.554 --> 12:02.930
How did you know it was me?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.473
You knock
in a very annoying way.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.393
Oh, sorry.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.811
Dude, you still have that thing?

12:08.811 --> 12:10.312
Yeah.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.149
He tried to kill us
and he cut off half my toe.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.818
Yeah. Sometimes I just think
I'm insecure in my masculinity

12:15.818 --> 12:18.320
so I'm making up for it
by having a dangerous pet.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.114
You know, like one
of those knuckle-dicks
in Georgia

12:20.114 --> 12:21.157
with a tiger on a leash.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.994
Dude, my advice? Cut it out
with the introspection.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.371
The mind is a den of scorpions
better left running from,

12:27.455 --> 12:31.208
not towards.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.751
What is Goff doing?

12:44.346 --> 12:45.681
What the fuck?

12:45.681 --> 12:49.852
Let's go! Move out!

13:06.118 --> 13:08.954
What?
<i>I think we got a problem.</i>

13:09.038 --> 13:14.376
Okay, Goff. One tap is "yes."
Two taps is "no."

13:14.460 --> 13:16.962
Do you understand?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.839
Okay, Goff...

13:19.965 --> 13:21.967
is that a peace sign?

13:23.469 --> 13:25.054
Ooh. Goff,
what's your favorite color?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.224
Dude, it's--
it's yes-or-no questions,
I just said it.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.519
Right. Okay, yeah. Uh... Goff,
is your favorite color teal?

13:31.519 --> 13:34.647
- Bro, what the fuck?
- What?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.065
I'm gonna go through
all the colors,

13:36.065 --> 13:37.441
and then eventually,
we'll find out
which one he likes best.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.277
Yeah, and why
would you give a fuck
what his favorite color is,

13:40.361 --> 13:41.654
- and why are you starting with teal?
- You don't think

13:41.654 --> 13:43.572
it's interesting that
a praying mantis thing
has a favorite color

13:43.656 --> 13:46.784
and it might unexpectedly be
teal?

13:46.784 --> 13:49.245
That is mildly interesting,
but he just drew a peace sign
on the jar.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.705
- Don't we wanna see what's up with that?
- Yes, we do.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.376
Goff, why did you put
a peace sign on the jar?

13:55.376 --> 13:58.087
Yes or no! It's yes or no!
It's only fucking
yes-or-no questions!

13:58.087 --> 14:01.090
- That's a lot of rules.
- Two fucking rules. Two!

14:01.090 --> 14:04.093
One, yes or no.
Two, don't be a fucking moron.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.427
How am I supposed to follow
that second rule?

14:05.511 --> 14:08.305
Maybe by shutting the fuck up!

14:08.389 --> 14:11.433
Oh! Okay, I see. I see how you are.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.353
Your preferred
conversation partners
are Eagly and Goff!

14:14.353 --> 14:16.188
Neither of who are capable
of speech!

14:16.272 --> 14:18.357
Try introspection
on that, motherfucker!

14:20.818 --> 14:23.362
- Sorry.
- No, you're right, you know, I...

14:24.196 --> 14:25.614
I do surround myself with things

14:25.698 --> 14:27.950
that don't talk back
and maybe I just--

14:27.950 --> 14:29.952
- You shouldn't blame yourself.
- Dude, fucking-- I'm talking!

14:29.952 --> 14:30.786
Listen!

14:32.621 --> 14:33.914

14:33.998 --> 14:35.874

Goff, are the Butterflies here

14:51.015 --> 14:52.349

in us like in <i>Alien?</i>

14:57.563 --> 14:58.981
Dude, you're upset about that?

14:58.981 --> 14:59.940
Well, how else
I'm gonna experience motherhood?

15:01.317 --> 15:02.735
Hmm, I don't know.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.029
Goff, are you here

15:05.029 --> 15:07.906
so we can help you
get back home, like in <i>E.T.?</i>

15:09.533 --> 15:12.536

15:12.620 --> 15:14.163

- Yeah, we kept Goff.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.032
