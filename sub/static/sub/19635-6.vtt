WEBVTT

00:02.519 --> 00:04.318
We had a client
about 11 months ago.

00:04.319 --> 00:06.318
She never reported it.
It sounds very similar

00:06.319 --> 00:08.478
to the attack
on Trish Winterman.

00:08.479 --> 00:10.758
We've got a serial rapist
who's been preying on women

00:10.759 --> 00:12.919
for two years and nobody's
even known it was happening.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.200
Police came to see me.
They know about us.

00:16.759 --> 00:18.359
Hi, Dad.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.238
I just need to borrow the old laptop.

00:20.239 --> 00:22.438
It's Mum's computer.
You should ask her.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.279
I'm sure you're right.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.638
Now, I am Danny's
dad, for God's sake!

00:27.639 --> 00:30.280
I'm not gonna stop until
I know I've done right by him.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.720 --> 01:08.199
Mate, we've spoken about this.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.359
- Dad, I can't sleep.
- No?

01:10.360 --> 01:13.519
Well, that's not gonna help, is it?

01:13.560 --> 01:16.439
Do you wanna play, then?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.599
Don't tell your mum.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.038
Right. What are we doing here?

01:25.039 --> 01:28.800
You worried about your exams?
Is that what's keeping you up?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.039
Don't worry about it.

01:33.079 --> 01:36.599
Just do your best.
That's all we can ask, you know?

01:36.600 --> 01:40.078
Nobody's gonna fault you
if you do your best.

01:40.079 --> 01:42.280
You'll be alright then.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.800
Got everything ahead of you, Dan.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.720
You're gonna have such a brilliant life.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.799
Hello.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.838
Beth? Oh, sorry.

02:27.839 --> 02:29.238
I thought you'd have it turned off.

02:29.239 --> 02:30.999
I was just gonna leave you a message.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.318
Trish, are you alright?

02:33.319 --> 02:36.038
I feel like I'm sinking, Beth.

02:36.039 --> 02:39.038
It's not a straight road.

02:39.039 --> 02:41.478
Some days will be harder than others.

02:41.479 --> 02:44.599
You're strong, Trish.
I'm so impressed with you.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.638
I hate myself.

02:46.639 --> 02:50.359
I don't want to be in my body.
I don't want to be in my head.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.038
Don't torture yourself.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.719
How long's this gonna last, Beth?

02:54.720 --> 02:57.838
Is this how I'm gonna be
for the rest of my life?

02:57.839 --> 03:02.000
I can't keep my mind still.

03:04.039 --> 03:07.478
He's made me so scared.
It's not fair.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.599
No.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.800
It's not.

03:13.079 --> 03:14.679
OK, so the chief super's coming in

03:14.680 --> 03:16.078
for a gold meeting first thing.

03:16.079 --> 03:18.038
I wanna make sure we've
got everything straight.

03:18.039 --> 03:19.879
Before these reports of
non-recent attacks,

03:19.920 --> 03:22.118
who were lining up
as our key suspects

03:22.119 --> 03:23.679
for the attack on Trish Winterman?

03:23.680 --> 03:27.119
Right, so
we've identified 65 men

03:27.159 --> 03:28.799
we know were present at the party.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.199
Through alibis and witness statements,

03:31.200 --> 03:33.518
we've ruled out 42.

03:33.519 --> 03:36.559
So we're left with people like, um,

03:36.560 --> 03:40.238
Ian Winterman - ex-husband,
bad relationship.

03:40.239 --> 03:42.679
Jim Atwood - slept
with her that morning,

03:42.680 --> 03:45.679
might've been worried his wife's
gonna find out at the party?

03:45.680 --> 03:47.878
So he raped her? I don't think
that automatically follows.

03:47.879 --> 03:50.438
I'm doing a list like you said.
I'm not saying it's perfect.

03:50.439 --> 03:54.359
Lucas, cab driver. Previously
had a drink with Trish.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.559
He lied in interview
about the night of the attack.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.478
- Uh, Leo Humphries.
- Oh, right, yeah.

03:58.479 --> 04:00.238
- Your mate, twine boy.
- Dodgy alibi.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.878
Connections with loads
of people at the party.

04:02.879 --> 04:05.359
Supplies local businesses
with blue twine.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.958
He's got no connection to Trish.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.359
Or Cath or Jim - he wasn't

04:08.360 --> 04:09.999
present at the party that we know of.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.438
We'll dig into why
his girlfriend's covering,

04:11.439 --> 04:13.200
but it doesn't mean
he was at Axehampton.

04:13.239 --> 04:14.919
Sorry.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.517
Oh. Text from Bob.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.358
"Uniform have been
called to a disturbance"

04:18.360 --> 04:20.399
"at Jim Atwood's garage -
Jim's been beaten up."

04:20.399 --> 04:24.280
- Is this of any interest to us?
- Yes, it is. Get your coat!

04:25.119 --> 04:27.118
He walks in and he launches at me.

04:27.119 --> 04:28.919
Slow down. Who did?

04:28.920 --> 04:31.238
Ed bloody Burnett.

04:31.239 --> 04:33.559
Punching, kicking.
He had me pinned on the floor.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.758
Ed Burnett did this to
you out of the blue?

04:35.759 --> 04:37.559
Yeah, out of the blue. Walked in.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.638
Not a word. Had a
crack and then he left.

04:39.639 --> 04:41.919
Even bloody took a cloth
to wipe his hands on.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.559
You've no idea what this was about?

04:43.560 --> 04:46.438
Don't start quizzing me.
I'm the victim here.

04:46.439 --> 04:49.438
Get after Ed Burnett and
lock that bloody psycho up.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.478
And when you find out
what this is all about,

04:51.479 --> 04:53.839
come and tell me,
with a bit of bloody sympathy.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.679
Quite the pasting he gave him.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.679
It's typical -
a woman gets attacked,

04:58.680 --> 05:01.080
and all the men go round butting
horns, making it about them.

05:06.319 --> 05:09.359
- What are you two doing here?
- Take a wild guess.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.919
Jim Atwood claims you attacked him

05:10.920 --> 05:12.318
at his garage earlier this evening.

05:12.319 --> 05:14.158
This is a waste of your time.

05:14.159 --> 05:15.919
Did you take a cloth from Jim?

05:15.920 --> 05:17.679
Don't know what you're talking about.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.359
I'll stay and look for it.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.799
- Stand and face the wall.
- Come on, you don't need those.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.239
I've seen Jim Atwood's
injuries. Stand up, please.

06:15.119 --> 06:18.600
What caused you to leave there
and head to the garage?

06:20.039 --> 06:21.759
I don't want to discuss it.

06:23.879 --> 06:25.799
Mr Burnett, let's be
clear about one thing.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.679
This is not a discussion.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.799
This is a formal police interview,

06:29.800 --> 06:32.758
after which we will decide
whether or not to charge you.

06:32.759 --> 06:36.518
So anything you have to say
in mitigation or explanation

06:36.519 --> 06:39.878
as to your actions towards
Jim Atwood tonight, say it now.

06:39.879 --> 06:41.958
'Cause otherwise, it just looks to me

06:41.959 --> 06:43.878
like you attacked a man for no reason.

06:43.879 --> 06:45.518
It wasn't no reason.

06:45.519 --> 06:48.759
What made you drive over there
and attack him that viciously?

06:50.839 --> 06:52.759
He slept with Trish Winterman.

06:54.959 --> 06:58.238
Oh, no, no, no.
You've gotta be kidding me.

06:58.239 --> 07:00.038
Katie, can you get the DI

07:00.039 --> 07:01.799
out of the interview
room for me, please?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.199
You'll have to do it yourself.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.359
Are you refusing to do
what I just asked you?

07:05.360 --> 07:07.118
Yeah, I am.

07:07.119 --> 07:09.560
You are in so much shit
when I get back here!

07:13.639 --> 07:16.279
So Cath Atwood asked you
to beat up her husband?

07:16.280 --> 07:18.438
- No.
- But she knew you were going to?

07:18.439 --> 07:20.478
No.

07:20.479 --> 07:23.079
DI Hardy, I need to talk
to you urgently outside.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.478
Can you not see I'm
in the middle of something?

07:27.479 --> 07:29.999
Yes, and do you not understand I
might have something important?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.559
Recovered from the farm shop.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.719
Florist cards identical
to the one that was on

07:33.720 --> 07:35.399
the flowers left at Trish's house.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.038
I'll have them and the original
checked for Ed's prints.

07:38.039 --> 07:41.078
Beetroot?
You brought back... Oh.

07:41.079 --> 07:44.078
Exactly. All the farm-grown
vegetables sold at the shop

07:44.079 --> 07:45.838
are bundled together with blue twine.

07:45.839 --> 07:47.479
So if I test these fibres

07:47.519 --> 07:49.638
against the fibres found
in Trish's wrist wounds...

07:49.639 --> 07:52.118
- I need to talk to you both...
- Not now, Harford.

07:52.119 --> 07:54.638
I should have told you a while back.

07:54.639 --> 07:56.600
Should have told us what?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.158
Ed Burnett's my dad.

08:00.159 --> 08:02.438
Tell me you're kidding.

08:02.439 --> 08:04.199
No.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.078
The man we have in custody...

08:06.079 --> 08:08.078
- I didn't think it mattered.
- He's a suspect!

08:08.079 --> 08:10.279
- But he...
- He was on your list!

08:10.280 --> 08:12.919
I checked with him at the start.
He said he didn't know anything.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.238
God, Katie, do you
know what you've done?

08:15.239 --> 08:16.919
You have to leave
this office immediately.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.078
Do not touch anything,
do not take anything,

08:19.079 --> 08:21.719
don't speak to anyone
or contact anyone in any way.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.200
In fact, give me your mobile phone.

08:25.119 --> 08:26.920
Put that in a sealed evidence bag.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.719
- Sir, I promise...
- Keep your mouth shut.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.679
We have a suspect in custody
and you cannot be here.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.599
I understand.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.238
Oh, really? Really?

08:37.239 --> 08:38.638
You understand how royally

08:38.639 --> 08:40.215
you might have screwed
this investigation?

08:40.239 --> 08:41.638
Because if we find out that

08:41.639 --> 08:43.477
Trish's attacker has
any connection to you,

08:43.479 --> 08:45.318
this will never stand up in court!

08:45.319 --> 08:48.158
And you will have to answer not
only to me and the chief super,

08:48.159 --> 08:50.200
but to the women that he's attacked.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.319
Get out now!

08:59.839 --> 09:03.078
What do you want us to do if it
turns out Ed really did this?

09:03.079 --> 09:05.518
Ed Burnett has just admitted
that he attacked Jim Atwood

09:05.519 --> 09:07.799
because he found out
that Jim slept with Trish.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.878
So you put that with this evidence.

09:09.879 --> 09:12.000
We need a full search of his house.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.359
- Are we done? Can I go?
- No. We've got more questions.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.238
Ed Burnett, I am further
arresting you in connection with

09:23.239 --> 09:26.079
the rape of Trish Winterman
at Axehampton House.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.438
Katie Harford?

10:13.439 --> 10:15.799
But she's one of the
group I earmarked...

10:15.800 --> 10:17.199
Stellar prospects, yep.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.878
Brought her up through
your recommendation.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.838
- Oh, God, so this is my fault.
- Never crossed my mind, ma'am.

10:21.839 --> 10:25.238
If it's any consolation, I think
she was just stupid, not bent.

10:25.239 --> 10:27.078
OK, if I were you -

10:27.079 --> 10:29.679
and I'm not in any official capacity

10:29.680 --> 10:32.878
saying that you should do
this - do the gold meeting,

10:32.879 --> 10:35.238
don't get into any detail
with the rest of the team,

10:35.239 --> 10:37.078
then afterwards, before
you make your press statement,

10:37.079 --> 10:40.920
go outside, get some air,
maybe a coffee,

10:40.959 --> 10:43.919
and if you happen to
bump into Katie Harford,

10:43.920 --> 10:46.679
which you might, get things straight.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.199
Find out what she's been across,
what she said to the suspect,

10:49.200 --> 10:50.838
so you know what you're dealing with.

10:50.839 --> 10:53.800
You've got an hour and then
I need to alert the DPS.

10:55.439 --> 10:58.399
How likely is it this
bloke is the perpetrator?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.318
- He's our prime focus right now.
- Mmm, course he is.

11:00.319 --> 11:03.118
Defence would have a party
with this in court.

11:03.119 --> 11:05.078
I'm not letting this compromise us.

11:05.079 --> 11:07.679
No attacker is getting off
because of her mistake.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.279
Don't beat yourself up about
this. It's not your fault.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.279
Just make sure you keep it internal

11:13.280 --> 11:16.079
and concentrate on finding
our serial offender.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.158
In addition to the attacks

11:19.159 --> 11:20.999
on Trish Winterman and Laura Benson,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.958
a third attack has been
disclosed to us by an ISVA.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.878
The woman herself is not as yet
prepared to disclose to us.

11:26.879 --> 11:28.638
However, based on
the information she gave

11:28.639 --> 11:31.438
to her ISVA, we now have
three scenes to compare.

11:31.439 --> 11:36.838
Now, DC Harford will not be
in today for personal reasons.

11:36.839 --> 11:38.438
DS Miller will cover her actions

11:38.439 --> 11:40.199
after she's given the public statement.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.679
We'll also continue
to interview Ed Burnett,

11:42.680 --> 11:44.318
who's currently in custody.

11:44.319 --> 11:47.319
Right, you've all got your
actions. Get on with it.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.478
It's really
good to see you, Nira.

12:02.479 --> 12:04.158
What do you want?

12:04.159 --> 12:06.238
There's a concern that
the man who attacked you

12:06.239 --> 12:07.759
has also attacked some other women.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.478
When?

12:10.479 --> 12:12.478
The police are still trying
to put it all together,

12:12.479 --> 12:15.078
but one woman was raped two years ago

12:15.079 --> 12:17.800
and another woman was raped
just over a week ago.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.319
Do you want to sit down?

12:27.280 --> 12:30.078
I wanted to ask if
you would reconsider

12:30.079 --> 12:32.838
disclosing some details to the police.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.919
No.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.999
Don't make me relive this.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.679
It could help the current investigation.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.438
It could stop further women
from being attacked.

12:41.439 --> 12:44.078
Do not put that on me.
Who are you to judge me?

12:44.079 --> 12:45.999
- I'm not judging you.
- Yes, you are.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.479
You're thinking,
"How can she be so selfish?"

12:51.079 --> 12:53.319
I don't owe anyone anything.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.559
When I needed help, no-one was there.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.758
We were there, Nira.
I was there for you.

12:57.759 --> 12:59.280
We still are.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.239
What happened to you, Nira?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.599
I was walking home.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.079
My car broke down.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.799
I had to call the breakdown
services, but they never came.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.400
And so I was walking, and
I went across this field, and...

13:22.839 --> 13:25.360
If I report it,
I have to tell my family.

13:27.519 --> 13:30.359
And they'll be upset,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.279
and they'll tell others,

13:32.280 --> 13:35.359
and to all those people

13:35.360 --> 13:37.878
I'll forever be the girl that was raped.

13:37.879 --> 13:40.559
You don't have to go public.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.878
It's just a conversation
with the detectives.

13:42.879 --> 13:44.838
I don't want a conversation.

13:44.839 --> 13:47.118
I want it to go away.

13:47.119 --> 13:50.158
The more help you get,
the better the outcome for you.

13:50.159 --> 13:51.919
I really believe that.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.958
I'm not changing my mind.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.079
I'm not talking to the police.

14:48.239 --> 14:51.478
All I want to know is what Ed
told you and what you told him.

14:51.479 --> 14:53.158
Nothing! Honestly.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.118
I talked to him as soon as
I knew he'd been at the party

14:56.119 --> 14:57.958
and he swore he had
nothing to do with it.

14:57.959 --> 15:00.279
- And you thought that was fine?
- It's not what you think.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.478
I've barely seen him
in the last 12 years.

15:02.479 --> 15:04.118
We're not that close.

15:04.119 --> 15:06.920
He says he's not a rapist
and you take him at face value

15:06.959 --> 15:08.438
and you omit to share that with anyone.

15:08.439 --> 15:10.958
You've never liked me,
have you, Ellie?

15:10.959 --> 15:13.559
Actually, I was starting
not to mind you.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.399
Against all the odds.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.279
You swanned in with no training,
you thought you knew it all.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.118
And yeah, my hackles were up,

15:20.119 --> 15:22.478
because I had to work
so hard to get into CID.

15:22.479 --> 15:24.238
So bloody hard.

15:24.239 --> 15:26.838
I took so much shit back
then, you have no idea.

15:26.839 --> 15:29.118
Because I was new,
because I was a woman.

15:29.119 --> 15:30.919
I fought all the battles
you now benefit from.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.479
People like you wander into CID
with six months experience,

15:33.519 --> 15:36.359
sod-all training, and
you think you own the world.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.078
Well, that lack of
training and experience

15:38.079 --> 15:39.719
is exactly what caused this.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.118
It was an innocent mistake.

15:42.119 --> 15:46.199
No, it was a stupid, basic,
page-one mistake.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.560
And, you know, more
than that, it was selfish.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.118
You wanted to believe he had

15:50.119 --> 15:51.679
nothing to do with it, so you did.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.559
You know, the one thing
a decent police officer -

15:53.560 --> 15:55.118
and certainly a decent detective -

15:55.119 --> 15:56.639
cannot be is selfish.

15:58.439 --> 16:00.239
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

16:00.280 --> 16:02.479
Anything else we should know?
Now's the time.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.158
Please don't take me off the case.

16:08.159 --> 16:10.438
There must be something
that I can do to fix this...

16:10.439 --> 16:12.719
Have you heard anything
we have said? You're done!

16:12.720 --> 16:14.239
Go home.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.318
Might put you in charge of
bollockings from now on, Miller.

16:25.319 --> 16:27.000
Fine by me.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.359
- Hi.
- Hi. Are we due to meet?

16:35.360 --> 16:37.279
No, I got a call from the police.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.878
They're going to be
making an announcement.

16:38.879 --> 16:40.878
I wanted to talk to you about it first.

16:40.879 --> 16:42.720
Right. OK.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.318
On the night of Saturday 28 May,

16:46.319 --> 16:50.318
a 49-year-old woman was
knocked unconscious and raped

16:50.319 --> 16:52.158
in the grounds of Axehampton House.

16:52.159 --> 16:56.199
We are currently pursuing
a number of lines of inquiry.

16:56.200 --> 17:00.158
As a result of the publicity
surrounding our investigation,

17:00.159 --> 17:04.438
we've received two further
historic allegations of rape.

17:04.439 --> 17:06.398
It is possible that all three attacks

17:06.400 --> 17:08.358
were carried out by
the same perpetrator.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.598
We would ask anyone
who has any information

17:11.599 --> 17:13.637
relating to either
the attack at Axehampton

17:13.638 --> 17:17.238
or any non-recent incidents
of sexual assault

17:17.239 --> 17:20.679
to please contact the police
in the strictest confidence.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.358
We would also like to make it clear

17:23.359 --> 17:25.478
to any other women out there

17:25.479 --> 17:28.478
who have been sexually assaulted
or raped in the past

17:28.479 --> 17:31.038
and chose not to disclose those attacks,

17:31.039 --> 17:32.599
please come forward.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.318
You will be believed,

17:34.319 --> 17:36.478
and you will be treated
with dignity and respect.

17:36.479 --> 17:39.878
In the meantime, we're
urging the local community

17:39.879 --> 17:43.038
to remain vigilant and consider
their own personal safety.

17:43.039 --> 17:46.399
We are actively pursuing
a number of leads.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.158
If you believe you know
or have seen or have heard

17:51.159 --> 17:55.518
something relevant,
please come forward.

17:55.519 --> 17:58.118
As I say, all information
will be treated

17:58.119 --> 18:00.279
with absolute confidence.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.758
This attacker is
somebody's family member -

18:02.759 --> 18:07.919
a husband or a brother or a son
or a friend or a colleague.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.199
And we will do everything we can

18:10.200 --> 18:11.799
to capture the person responsible

18:11.800 --> 18:13.280
and bring them to justice.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.199
Did you, uh... see the
statement the police just made?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.399
What were you doing in
the house last night, Dad?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.399
What? Why would I be in the house?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.438
Mum's computer was there
when we went to bed

18:28.439 --> 18:30.118
and it wasn't there this morning.

18:30.119 --> 18:31.518
What makes you think that was me?

18:31.519 --> 18:33.478
You're the only other
person who has a key,

18:33.479 --> 18:35.118
and you asked me for her computer.

18:35.119 --> 18:36.719
Leah, seriously...

18:36.720 --> 18:38.719
Dad, please, please,

18:38.720 --> 18:42.000
I really need you not to
behave weirdly right now.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.638
This is my spare locker key.

18:44.639 --> 18:47.359
If Mum's computer is in there
at the end of the school day,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.919
I can take it home, put it back
and don't have to tell anyone.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.758
Leah, I really don't know what you mean.

18:51.759 --> 18:54.759
Supposed to be you parenting me,
not the other way around.

19:17.639 --> 19:19.078
You look proper shit.

19:19.079 --> 19:21.878
I hear Ed's in custody.

19:21.879 --> 19:23.680
Good.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.238
Did you see the news report?

19:28.239 --> 19:31.599
So I've packed up
most of your clothes.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.318
No, Cath. Please...

19:33.319 --> 19:35.118
No, I don't want to hear it.

19:35.119 --> 19:37.158
Look, I know what I've done -

19:37.159 --> 19:39.159
gone and ballsed it all up.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.038
But I'm so lost right now.

19:43.039 --> 19:46.600
Please, Cath, don't
throw me out. Please.

19:51.639 --> 19:54.559
You know, even if I took
you back - which I won't -

19:54.560 --> 19:56.599
how is it gonna work now?

19:56.600 --> 20:00.999
How are we gonna see Trish
or Ian or... half this town

20:01.000 --> 20:02.638
now that everybody knows?

20:02.639 --> 20:04.438
Well, we can style it out.

20:04.439 --> 20:06.518
You actually think
that's possible, don't you -

20:06.519 --> 20:08.118
style it out?

20:08.119 --> 20:09.799
Yeah, but what do you want, then, Cath?

20:09.800 --> 20:13.359
I want you to come up with a solution

20:13.360 --> 20:16.038
to all this shit that
you have poured on us.

20:16.039 --> 20:17.599
Come on, it's not that bad.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.279
It is that bad!

20:19.280 --> 20:22.238
Do you think I don't know all
the loans and the unpaid bills

20:22.239 --> 20:24.359
this shitty little garage
is drowning under?

20:24.360 --> 20:26.559
Yeah, but it didn't stop you
from demanding a birthday party

20:26.560 --> 20:28.118
that would've bankrupted
a bloody sheikh.

20:28.119 --> 20:30.719
'Cause I was waiting
for you to come clean!

20:30.720 --> 20:32.439
I am still bloody waiting!

20:41.759 --> 20:43.559
We could leave.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.680
Start again.

20:47.839 --> 20:50.118
Somewhere else.

20:50.119 --> 20:52.479
Somewhere that people don't know us.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.799
It's a good time to go.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.439
Don't you think?

21:13.600 --> 21:15.919
You need to stop this.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.799
I don't need to do anything you say.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.118
What do you want, Mark?

21:20.119 --> 21:21.758
Just a talk.

21:21.759 --> 21:23.478
That's all.

21:23.479 --> 21:25.680
Here?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.519
Fine.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.400
Go on, then. Talk.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.638
Why'd you plead innocent?

21:55.639 --> 21:58.360
Why'd you make us
go through that trial?

22:00.039 --> 22:03.519
- Show me your phone, Mark.
- Why?

22:04.639 --> 22:07.119
Just... do it.

22:14.479 --> 22:16.318
You think I'm stupid?

22:16.319 --> 22:18.518
You record me, give it to
the police as new evidence.

22:18.519 --> 22:21.279
What else have you got in your pockets?

22:21.280 --> 22:23.039
Go on, turn 'em out.

22:37.039 --> 22:38.799
Is that what you came to do?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.439
I dunno. Maybe.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.759
If I had the chance
and if I had the nerve.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.438
What about your family?

22:49.439 --> 22:51.038
My family...

22:51.039 --> 22:53.279
My family, Joe?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.399
I don't have a family!

22:55.400 --> 22:57.238
You took that!

22:57.239 --> 22:59.038
It was a mistake,
what happened with Danny.

22:59.039 --> 23:00.638
I didn't mean to kill him.

23:00.639 --> 23:02.638
Talk me through it.

23:02.639 --> 23:05.000
Take me through the night
you killed my son.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.680
- Why?
- Why?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.680
Because I need to hear it from you, Joe.

23:19.879 --> 23:22.318
I need to know what
happened, what you did.

23:22.319 --> 23:24.038
Mark...

23:24.039 --> 23:25.759
Don't tell me what I need!

23:29.159 --> 23:32.478
I have to know exactly what
happened, Joe. I can't move on.

23:32.479 --> 23:35.119
I can't deal with any of
this stuff until I know.

23:39.639 --> 23:41.200
Alright.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.439
I'll tell you.

23:55.839 --> 23:57.599
Oh, please just go away.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.799
- I think you're wrong.
- You can't talk to me like that!

23:59.800 --> 24:02.438
I'm not your ISVA. You chose
not to be a client of ours.

24:02.439 --> 24:04.279
- I'm just a woman who's angry.
- With me?

24:04.280 --> 24:05.958
With the man who did this to you,

24:05.959 --> 24:07.638
but yeah, with you a little bit.

24:07.639 --> 24:10.238
I'm angry because we have to fight this!

24:10.239 --> 24:13.199
We cannot let men get away with
doing these things to us.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.919
I don't want that responsibility.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.758
I know you don't, but tough
luck, 'cause you've got it.

24:17.759 --> 24:20.118
You thought you were
the only one he did this to,

24:20.119 --> 24:22.359
but you are not -
you are far from alone.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.719
What'll happen to other women
if you don't speak out?

24:25.720 --> 24:28.759
How do we stop this man if
you pretend it never happened?

24:33.839 --> 24:35.759
I'm sorry, Mark.

24:37.639 --> 24:39.119
I'm so sorry.

24:40.159 --> 24:42.999
We came to your house.
Dan and Tom were friends.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.479
I just had this...

24:46.839 --> 24:49.639
I don't know, moment.

24:52.239 --> 24:55.039
I know you want me in prison.

24:55.079 --> 24:57.039
But look at my life here.

24:58.280 --> 25:02.079
I've lost my family, my friends.

25:03.639 --> 25:06.319
I'm only here because I'm not
brave enough to kill myself.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.159
And I should've done
that a long time ago.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.719
I've got half an hour.
I've gotta get back.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.518
I saw you on the news earlier.
You looked terrible!

25:24.519 --> 25:27.958
Is it true that other women
might have been attacked?

25:27.959 --> 25:29.518
Yeah, it's possible.

25:29.519 --> 25:33.919
You ask me, everyone's
been raped or abused.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.680
You know, one or the other.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.438
No-one is asking you, Dad.

25:37.439 --> 25:39.518
Am I not allowed to have an opinion?

25:39.519 --> 25:41.118
- No.
- Oh!

25:41.119 --> 25:43.318
- You understand about consent?
- Oh, Mum, do we have to...

25:43.319 --> 25:45.478
Yeah, we do. It's important.

25:45.479 --> 25:47.776
I'm not having you thinking what
Granddad's saying is acceptable.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.199
Whenever you're with a girl
or a woman or whatever,

25:50.200 --> 25:52.838
you must ask and you must
be certain that she has agreed

25:52.839 --> 25:54.599
to whatever it is
you are doing together.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.238
- Alright?
- Yes.

25:56.239 --> 25:59.280
Mum, can we please just eat?

26:01.119 --> 26:03.078
Was that your phone?

26:03.079 --> 26:05.078
I didn't give you your phone back.

26:05.079 --> 26:07.719
- Did you give him his phone back?
- No!

26:07.720 --> 26:09.719
How did you get your phone back?

26:09.720 --> 26:12.319
Give it here now. Unlocked.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.719
You don't have to look on there...

26:16.720 --> 26:18.199
Why would you not want me to look?

26:18.200 --> 26:19.800
I've deleted everything from your phone.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.600
Tell the police
what you just told me.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.360
Give us justice.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.039
I can't do prison, Mark.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.400
I lost everything I had.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.159
Everything I was.

26:56.119 --> 26:58.000
And I'll never escape it.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.200
I was there that night,
in the car park.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.200
I could have stopped you.

27:10.479 --> 27:12.519
No.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.119
No, he was already dead.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.400
I saw you through the window
when I was cleaning.

27:22.839 --> 27:24.720
He was already on the beach.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.159
I always...

27:33.839 --> 27:36.038
I always thought
I could have stopped you.

27:36.039 --> 27:39.280
No, you were too late.

27:40.439 --> 27:42.319
It wouldn't have made any difference.

27:54.360 --> 27:57.280
What do you wanna do, Mark?
Do you wanna use that knife?

28:01.319 --> 28:02.680
No.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.518
I can't live with what you've done to us

28:07.519 --> 28:09.799
but I'm not strong enough
to make you pay.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.439
It's pathetic, innit?

28:15.879 --> 28:17.600
What do I do now?

28:49.879 --> 28:52.118
So you not only stole back your phone,

28:52.119 --> 28:55.079
you kept what I deleted
and you added even more.

29:05.239 --> 29:07.438
Do you know how much that cost?

29:07.439 --> 29:09.799
Yeah, I do. And we can't
afford to buy new ones.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.478
So from now on, there is no smartphone

29:11.479 --> 29:13.638
and you use the computer at the library.

29:13.639 --> 29:15.958
Where did you get that porn from?

29:15.959 --> 29:18.318
Michael Lucas.

29:18.319 --> 29:21.200
- And where did he get it from?
- His dad.

29:22.159 --> 29:25.119
- Does his dad drive a taxi?
- Yeah.

29:28.319 --> 29:30.158
How are the chips?

29:30.159 --> 29:31.639
Good.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.159
Dad, I've packed my stuff.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.199
I'm booked on a train tomorrow.
I'm going back to Mum's.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.559
- No, no, don't do that.
- It's not working for me here.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.399
You can't keep running from things,

29:46.400 --> 29:48.399
you can't keep bouncing back
between me and your mum.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.000
- That's not what it is.
- Actually, it is.

29:52.839 --> 29:55.158
Don't kid yourself things'll
be better with your mum.

29:55.159 --> 29:57.038
You came here 'cause you
were having problems there.

29:57.039 --> 29:58.758
Stay here.

29:58.759 --> 30:00.919
Fight a wee bit.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.559
I'll help you, even if I have to

30:02.560 --> 30:04.559
smack a teenage boy in the face for you.

30:04.560 --> 30:07.518
What, and lose your job?
That'd be great.

30:07.519 --> 30:09.399
Anything for you.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.158
Come on, you're not a wee girl anymore.

30:12.159 --> 30:14.118
You've got to face up to the world.

30:14.119 --> 30:16.360
Take some responsibility
for your own life.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.639
The future's not inevitable.
It's down to you.

30:25.239 --> 30:27.758
I know I've not been very good
at the whole dad thing,

30:27.759 --> 30:29.239
but I love you so much, Daise.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.438
And I've missed loads of you growing up.

30:32.439 --> 30:33.999
- Dad...
- No, listen, come on.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.399
I missed so much of that,

30:35.400 --> 30:37.279
and I can't make up
for missing that time,

30:37.280 --> 30:38.760
and I'll never forgive myself for it.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.038
But I'm learning, yeah?

30:43.039 --> 30:45.200
I'll make more time for you.

30:47.119 --> 30:49.159
I want to be a good dad.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.800
And I want you to know...

30:54.079 --> 30:56.118
I just need you to know
how loved you are.

30:56.119 --> 30:57.720
I haven't said that enough.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.279
You know I got sick and I nearly
died, right? And I didn't.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.720
And I think that is 'cause
I'm meant to be here.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.559
In this stupid place
with these stupid cliffs.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.719
I'm meant to be here,
to be doing this job,

31:12.720 --> 31:14.239
and I'm meant to look after you.

31:15.159 --> 31:16.838
Sleep on it.
Decide in the morning.

31:16.839 --> 31:20.319
Just don't... don't give up
on this place, on us.

31:21.759 --> 31:23.639
Not yet. Please.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.479
Who's that?

31:30.519 --> 31:32.719
30 seconds.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.559
You can't be in contact with me.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.079
But there's something
I should have told you before.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.518
Thanks for making me wait
all night and half the day.

31:43.519 --> 31:45.719
I see in the absence of any evidence,

31:45.720 --> 31:47.318
you've gone for the
textbook police approach

31:47.319 --> 31:49.038
of 'blame the black guy'.

31:49.039 --> 31:51.438
Why did you send Trish flowers, Ed?

31:51.439 --> 31:53.239
Who says I did?

31:54.400 --> 31:59.158
For the tape, I'm showing
Mr Burnett exhibit EM102.

31:59.159 --> 32:01.799
This anonymous card was
placed in a bunch of flowers

32:01.800 --> 32:03.199
that was sent to Trish Winterman.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.038
Your prints are on the original.

32:05.039 --> 32:08.560
And these identical cards
were found in your office.

32:09.839 --> 32:12.478
So I sent her some flowers.
What's the problem with that?

32:12.479 --> 32:14.038
Why do it anonymously?

32:14.039 --> 32:15.878
I didn't realise
it was against the law.

32:15.879 --> 32:18.118
You guys are gonna have your
hands full come Valentine's Day.

32:18.119 --> 32:20.359
Oh, it's not illegal, but it is odd,

32:20.360 --> 32:24.158
sending an unsigned card to
a woman that's just been raped.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.638
What does that mean,
"Thinking of you"?

32:26.639 --> 32:29.238
Just that! Don't make it weird.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.758
But it is a bit weird, though, Ed.

32:30.759 --> 32:33.799
'Cause you know what
it looks like? A threat.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.238
It was nothing like that!

32:35.239 --> 32:37.359
- Lose your temper a lot, Ed?
- No.

32:37.360 --> 32:39.238
You lost it that night
at Cath Atwood's party.

32:39.239 --> 32:42.039
Flew off the handle,
had a row with Jim, then what?

32:44.079 --> 32:45.638
Did you take it out on Trish Winterman

32:45.639 --> 32:47.518
and then feel bad,
so you sent her flowers?

32:47.519 --> 32:50.118
Stop saying that. I would
never hurt Trish. I couldn't!

32:50.119 --> 32:52.159
- Why couldn't you?
- Because I love her.

32:55.759 --> 32:57.560
I love her.

32:58.959 --> 33:00.559
Do you believe him?

33:00.560 --> 33:03.199
What, that he's in love
with Trish? Yeah, possibly.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.958
Doesn't mean he didn't rape her.

33:04.959 --> 33:06.878
Arguably gives him an extra motive.

33:06.879 --> 33:09.038
And if he can do that to Jim Atwood...

33:09.039 --> 33:11.079
Oh, the results of Ed's
phone is coming through.

33:13.839 --> 33:15.518
How many photos are on here?

33:15.519 --> 33:20.078
5,219, dating
back nearly 10 years.

33:20.079 --> 33:23.799
Blimey. Pretty much all Trish Winterman.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.519
That's not love, that's obsession.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.038
Did Trish know
you were taking all these?

33:33.039 --> 33:34.919
Most of them.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.038
I've told you how I feel about her.

33:37.039 --> 33:39.599
- It's not against the law.
- Being in love isn't.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.359
But stalking is. And that's
what this looks like to us.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.318
- Don't call it that.
- These aren't romantic photos.

33:45.319 --> 33:47.158
- They're obsessional ones.
- You're wrong.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.239
You just want to turn it
into something it's not.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.720
I think that's what you wanna do.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.680
Where have you slept
the last week or two, Ed?

33:57.920 --> 33:59.638
At home.

33:59.639 --> 34:01.799
We made an appeal
for witnesses earlier today.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.599
Quite a strong response so far.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.438
Including a call from one of
Trish Winterman's neighbours

34:06.439 --> 34:08.199
in West Flintcombe.

34:09.478 --> 34:12.599
And she reported seeing a car
that matches your registration

34:12.600 --> 34:16.237
parked overnight in the car park
at the end of Trish's road

34:16.239 --> 34:19.438
every night for 10 nights in a row.

34:21.879 --> 34:23.478
I've been checking on her.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.279
Looking out for her.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.599
And can you see how that,
combined with the pictures,

34:28.600 --> 34:32.237
suggests a man with an unhealthy
obsessional interest in Trish?

34:32.239 --> 34:33.878
I'm not obsessed!

34:33.879 --> 34:35.639
Yeah, you are.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.757
You're basically an obsessive loser

34:38.759 --> 34:40.560
with a short fuse, aren't you, Ed?

34:42.199 --> 34:44.560
That's why you attacked
Jim Atwood, isn't it?

34:47.438 --> 34:50.038
'Cause he got a taste of
what you've never managed.

34:50.039 --> 34:52.199
Sit down, please.

34:59.759 --> 35:03.039
Can you show us what you wore
to Cath Atwood's party?

35:06.479 --> 35:08.200
Mum?

35:09.759 --> 35:11.360
Thanks, Leah.

35:18.839 --> 35:21.399
Well, I came here to
say we'd be grateful

35:21.400 --> 35:23.000
if you didn't contact us anymore.

35:23.039 --> 35:25.599
I can't help what
happened to you, Trish,

35:25.600 --> 35:28.878
but it's brought up stuff
you're gonna have to answer for.

35:28.879 --> 35:30.719
I'm gonna have to answer for?

35:30.720 --> 35:32.638
You're supposed to be my friend.

35:32.639 --> 35:35.318
You slept with my husband.
What kind of a friend does that?

35:35.319 --> 35:38.719
Well, maybe if you'd given
him what he needed...

35:38.720 --> 35:40.238
Say that again, Trish.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.878
No contact?
In a town like this?

35:42.879 --> 35:45.039
It's fine by me.
Good luck with that.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.999
Yeah, well, I don't think

35:48.000 --> 35:49.560
we're gonna be here much longer anyway.

35:50.759 --> 35:54.118
Jim and I think we're gonna
move away. Fresh start.

35:54.119 --> 35:56.078
Where will you go?

35:56.079 --> 35:58.799
You'd be no-one somewhere else.
You'd hate that.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.118
- I think we'll be fine.
- No, I don't think so, Cath.

36:01.119 --> 36:03.638
I mean, you behave like you're
better than the rest of us.

36:03.639 --> 36:07.478
But you're a girl on a till, same as me.

36:07.479 --> 36:10.400
Doesn't matter who was
queen bee in fifth year.

36:11.759 --> 36:13.478
Look, I know you're not

36:13.479 --> 36:15.478
the person you were
before you were raped...

36:15.479 --> 36:18.359
Oh, I am more that person
now than I have ever been.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.039
Now get out.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.959
Fine.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.838
No, no, no, no. Not that way.

36:25.839 --> 36:27.719
Not through my house.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.158
Back way.

36:29.159 --> 36:30.878
Slink out, like your husband did.

36:30.879 --> 36:33.039
Go on.

36:42.079 --> 36:44.919
Mum, I need to talk to you.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.479
I think it might be important.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.720
Ian, seriously, put that away
before someone sees it.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.638
Oh, come on. There's no-one around.

36:59.639 --> 37:02.758
How do you even have that? You
said you didn't have it anymore.

37:02.759 --> 37:04.838
My daughter got it for me.

37:04.839 --> 37:06.638
So if you can take the stuff off there,

37:06.639 --> 37:09.038
- I'll put it back later tonight.
- Not touching it, mate.

37:09.039 --> 37:11.038
Police have been round to my work.

37:11.039 --> 37:12.559
Oh, the police have been everywhere.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.799
- They've even got their eye on me.
- Right.

37:14.800 --> 37:19.279
Mind you, I just heard they
arrested Ed Burnett last night.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.158
So, come on - you gonna
help me out here or what?

37:22.159 --> 37:24.359
It's not a good idea, mate. Not now.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.239
I'm sorry.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.038
Are they going through my whole house?

37:35.039 --> 37:36.638
It's procedure.

37:36.639 --> 37:38.279
Not to me it isn't.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.079
Sorry. You go on.
I'll have to take this.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.919
Hey, Beth. Everything alright?

37:44.920 --> 37:47.838
Yeah. We saw the other
woman who was attacked today.

37:47.839 --> 37:49.479
We tried everything,

37:49.519 --> 37:51.359
but she's not ready
to talk to the police.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.999
She's still really traumatised.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.719
But there's a new
thing she mentioned.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.719
Her car broke down and
she called a breakdown service.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.758
She was walking home
'cause they hadn't turned up

37:58.759 --> 38:00.199
and that's when she was attacked.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.599
Thanks.
That could be really helpful.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.638
I'm in the middle of
something at the moment.

38:03.639 --> 38:05.518
- Can we speak later?
- OK. 'Bye.

38:05.519 --> 38:07.000
'Bye.

38:11.959 --> 38:14.599
- Chlo?
- Yeah?

38:14.600 --> 38:17.280
Maybe look up from your phone?

38:18.519 --> 38:20.478
Better?

38:20.479 --> 38:23.720
I've got a solicitor's
appointment tomorrow.

38:25.239 --> 38:27.518
I'm thinking of asking
your dad for a divorce.

38:27.519 --> 38:31.518
- No. Mum, please don't.
- It's been a long time coming.

38:31.519 --> 38:33.919
It's a sticky period, that's
all. You'll patch things up.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.159
I don't think that's gonna happen.

38:37.239 --> 38:41.279
I love him, Chlo.
But I feel like I've lost him.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.279
And I can't see a way back.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.639
I'm sorry.

38:47.119 --> 38:49.119
What's happened to this family?

38:53.759 --> 38:56.280
Someone told me it was a formal do.

38:56.319 --> 38:58.999
But when I got there, I was
the only one wearing a suit.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.280
- We'll need the shoes.
- By the door.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.679
Why was there
twine in your suit, Ed?

39:12.680 --> 39:15.199
I was working in the shop
before I went to the party,

39:15.200 --> 39:17.038
catching up on things.

39:17.039 --> 39:19.038
- In your suit.
- Yes!

39:19.039 --> 39:20.999
I must have left some in my pockets.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.838
Right - see, the difficulty for us, Ed,

39:22.839 --> 39:26.078
is that this is very
similar to the twine

39:26.079 --> 39:30.238
used in the attack on
Trish Winterman at the party,

39:30.239 --> 39:33.400
during which you went off on your own...

39:35.639 --> 39:37.199
following a fight.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.478
- I don't know anything about it.
- Are you sure?

39:39.479 --> 39:43.400
Because if you do,
now's the time to mention it.

39:44.879 --> 39:47.399
There's a lot stacking
up against you, Ed.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.118
It's not just the night of the attack.

39:49.119 --> 39:51.238
There's the flowers, photos,

39:51.239 --> 39:54.878
being around Trish's
house, the violence.

39:54.879 --> 39:57.199
I am not a violent man.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.079
Did you ever hit your wife?

40:04.839 --> 40:06.518
It was just once.

40:06.519 --> 40:09.999
And there's only one way
you could have known that.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.599
Is Katie here?

40:12.600 --> 40:16.319
DC Harford has excused herself
from this investigation.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.400
Tell us about your wife, Ed.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.360
She died 12 years ago.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.638
I moved here straight after,

40:26.639 --> 40:28.280
set up the shop.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.158
Was it a happy marriage?

40:31.159 --> 40:34.638
When my wife was dying,

40:34.639 --> 40:36.360
we separated.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.839
I didn't behave very well.

40:41.159 --> 40:42.799
Cost me pretty much everything.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.159
My marriage, my daughter.

40:47.119 --> 40:50.399
We've only just started
patching things up this year.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.800
Why are there grass and
mud stains on your suit, Ed?

40:59.800 --> 41:04.600
Ed, I'm gonna apply for an
extension to your custody time.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.199
If it was him,
what happened that night?

41:10.200 --> 41:11.758
'Cause, yeah, he's clearly
obsessed with Trish,

41:11.759 --> 41:13.158
and he can be violent,

41:13.159 --> 41:15.038
but what pushed him
over the edge that night?

41:15.039 --> 41:16.438
There's no background
of sexual violence.

41:16.439 --> 41:18.158
That we know of. Have you seen this?

41:18.159 --> 41:20.079
Message from Trish Winterman.

41:26.639 --> 41:28.559
Mr Winterman.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.238
Oh, hello.

41:30.239 --> 41:32.838
I was just about to lock up, actually.

41:32.839 --> 41:34.559
Have you got your wife's laptop?

41:34.560 --> 41:36.679
Yes. Yes, I do.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.359
How'd you get it?

41:38.360 --> 41:41.078
- I popped round last night.
- Without asking?

41:41.079 --> 41:43.199
I didn't want to bother Trish.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.878
I know she doesn't want to see me,

41:44.879 --> 41:46.359
but I've still got a back door key.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.518
Why do you need the computer?

41:48.519 --> 41:51.318
Uh, it's got, um,
PowerPoint things - slides -

41:51.319 --> 41:53.078
on there that I need for teaching.

41:53.079 --> 41:54.999
PowerPoints of what?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.158
You know, various things.

41:57.159 --> 42:00.559
Osmosis, reproductive systems,

42:00.560 --> 42:02.600
the cellular life of plants.

42:02.639 --> 42:05.958
Right, well, we'll have
the computer now, thanks.

42:05.959 --> 42:07.638
Want to examine it for our inquiries.

42:07.639 --> 42:09.159
Right. Good.

42:10.479 --> 42:12.238
Thanks.

42:12.239 --> 42:14.359
Is it true you've got
Ed Burnett in custody?

42:14.360 --> 42:15.958
We don't discuss the investigation.

42:15.959 --> 42:17.638
No, quite right.

42:17.639 --> 42:20.078
It's just I've been thinking
a lot about Ed lately.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.920
You know I had to have words with him

42:21.959 --> 42:23.319
about a year and a half ago?

42:23.360 --> 42:25.478
He was sexually harassing Trish.

42:25.479 --> 42:27.478
She was worried about losing her job,

42:27.479 --> 42:30.038
so didn't wanna make a fuss,
so I had to go up there.

42:30.039 --> 42:33.119
I just thought you should know.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.518
Dad?

42:57.519 --> 42:59.158
Alright, darling?

42:59.159 --> 43:01.078
Where are you?

43:01.079 --> 43:04.999
I'm... just out for a walk.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.799
What, at this time of night?

43:06.800 --> 43:09.518
Yeah, it's nice and peaceful.

43:09.519 --> 43:11.799
Everything alright?

43:11.800 --> 43:14.038
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

43:14.039 --> 43:16.118
You sound a bit odd.

43:16.119 --> 43:19.079
Oh, do I? Oh, thanks very much.

43:19.959 --> 43:22.359
You know I love you, don't you?

43:22.360 --> 43:24.118
Yeah.

43:24.119 --> 43:26.118
Are you sure you're OK?

43:26.119 --> 43:28.479
Yeah, I'm always OK, me, Chlo.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.359
I've done my best for you, Chlo.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.799
I know.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.199
You and...

43:35.200 --> 43:38.199
You and Lizzy and Mum. And Dan.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.599
Dad...

43:39.600 --> 43:41.639
I'm just sorry if...

43:44.439 --> 43:46.438
if sometimes that wasn't enough.

43:46.439 --> 43:50.719
Dad, er, why don't you come
round? I'd like to see you.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.039
No, I'd best go.

43:53.959 --> 43:56.319
Do you wanna talk to Mum? She's here.

43:59.239 --> 44:00.639
No.

44:03.439 --> 44:05.159
I love you, Dad.

44:07.759 --> 44:09.479
I love you too, darling.
