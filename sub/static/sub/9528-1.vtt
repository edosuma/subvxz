01:55.041 --> 01:58.374

about? - Nothing, Mrs Baker

01:58.458 --> 02:00.832
Sorry, Mrs Baker

02:18.416 --> 02:22.540
Good evening, Mr and Mrs Moore
Your table awaits

02:29.250 --> 02:32.707
What sweet roses, Nobbs
You always remember

02:32.791 --> 02:34.874
Milady

02:40.875 --> 02:44.582
- Milady
- Good evening, Mrs Baker

02:45.333 --> 02:49.915
- Such a kind little man  - Who?
- Nobbs

02:50.000 --> 02:51.874
Oh, right

02:55.458 --> 02:57.082
What do you say,
the lamb or the beef?

02:57.166 --> 03:00.082
Will we be able to tell
the difference?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.832
Doctor Holloran

03:10.916 --> 03:12.999
Follow me

03:14.458 --> 03:18.749
- There now
- Thank you

03:18.833 --> 03:21.790
Have the lamb, Doctor Holloran
It will melt in your mouth

03:21.875 --> 03:24.332
The lamb it shall be, Duchess

03:24.708 --> 03:28.165
- Sean, Doctor Holloran
will take the lamb  - Yes, ma'am

03:30.166 --> 03:32.290
- Will you have the soup?
- l won't, thank you

03:32.375 --> 03:34.457
Sean

03:37.041 --> 03:40.124
- There's a stain on your tie
- Ma'am

03:40.208 --> 03:43.999
Have a care, Sean  Last week it was
the jacket  Tonight the tie

03:44.083 --> 03:46.124
- Yes, but
- Remember there are hundreds

03:46.208 --> 03:49.790
hundreds of young men walking the
streets of Dublin looking for work

03:49.875 --> 03:52.290
Young men, Sean

03:52.375 --> 03:54.457
Good man, Nobbs

03:58.083 --> 04:00.749
- Monsieur, madame
- Madame

04:01.541 --> 04:03.374
Madame, where is my glass
of iced water?

04:03.458 --> 04:05.957
Quick, Patrick

04:17.375 --> 04:19.957
- My Lordship
- Mrs Baker

04:22.708 --> 04:24.332
Terribly sorry

04:24.416 --> 04:27.249
I know we're late but could you
forgive us just this once?

04:27.333 --> 04:29.165
- We're simply famished
- Of course

04:29.250 --> 04:32.124
Aubrey insisted we walk
all the way from Ballsbridge

04:32.208 --> 04:35.832
There's nothing like a brisk walk
for giving the body an appetite

04:35.916 --> 04:39.124
Come along now,
your table is set and waiting

04:40.125 --> 04:42.707
Tell me, how is your mother,
dear Lady Yarrell?

04:42.791 --> 04:45.124
Tip-top, Mrs B  Tip-top

04:45.208 --> 04:47.040
I certainly hope
she'll come and visit us soon

04:47.125 --> 04:49.165
She'd be delighted, l'm sure

04:49.250 --> 04:53.624
- So sorry, dear lady  - No bother
at all, Mr Smythe-Willard

04:53.708 --> 04:55.707
to be sure

04:56.791 --> 05:00.332
My friends    we do apologise

05:02.625 --> 05:05.999
- Now, drinks
- Albert

05:28.833 --> 05:31.249
Bunny, you're a featherbrain

05:31.333 --> 05:34.499
No, he's not, he's brilliant!

05:34.583 --> 05:36.999
Do your Clara Westfield

05:37.458 --> 05:41.040
Dudley, call the brigade
My hair's on fire!

05:41.125 --> 05:42.749
My hair's on fire!

05:48.708 --> 05:51.457
A long old day, Mr Nobbs

05:55.333 --> 06:00.999
Well    l wouldn't say no to
a nightcap now, sure l wouldn't

06:02.583 --> 06:05.540
Only I haven't a drop left myself

06:07.416 --> 06:09.790
Goodnight, Mr Casey

06:12.583 --> 06:14.665
Mr Nobbs

06:31.958 --> 06:36.249
Half a crown from Mrs Moore
Six pence from the Doctor

06:36.333 --> 06:40.415
Tuppence    Monsieur Pigot

06:40.500 --> 06:43.624
Thruppence, Mrs Cavendish
when l brought her stationery

06:43.708 --> 06:48.082
Another thruppence from
what's-his-name, Viscount's friend

06:48.166 --> 06:51.540
Tanner from the Viscount
Another from his missus

06:56.458 --> 07:00.665
Two-and-six and six and two
is eight, three is eleven

07:00.750 --> 07:02.790
Three is one-and-two,
six is one-and-eight,

07:02.875 --> 07:06.040
six is two-and-two  That's

07:08.333 --> 07:11.207
4 shillings, 8 pence

08:11.625 --> 08:14.707
Mr Gilligan, madam, so good
to have had you with us again

08:14.791 --> 08:19.249
- l hope your stay was satisfactory?
- Yes, perfectly fine, thank you

08:27.000 --> 08:28.790
- Sorry, sir
- Look what you've done

08:28.875 --> 08:30.749
You've ruined my boots,
defaced my luggage

08:30.833 --> 08:32.415
I've never seen such blatant
incompetence

08:32.500 --> 08:36.207
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Does that look all right to you?

08:36.291 --> 08:39.290
- Where's that fool Sweeney?
- l'm very sorry, sir

08:39.375 --> 08:41.540
Yes, yes, everyone's sorry
It's outrageous ineptitude

08:42.333 --> 08:44.457
Clean up the mess
you've made of my boots

08:49.875 --> 08:54.582
I won't patronise this establishment
again and l will urge my friends

08:54.666 --> 08:57.749
and acquaintances to do the same
if you keep this man in your employ

08:57.833 --> 09:00.290
Yes, Mr Gilligan, sir

09:11.250 --> 09:13.457
- Dismiss him immediately
- Sir, I was to slip

09:13.541 --> 09:15.999
- Now!
- Yes, sir

09:16.916 --> 09:18.582
Fine

09:23.625 --> 09:25.832
Give us the marmalade there,
Mr Donaghue

09:33.375 --> 09:36.374
- lt's the marmalade
- The marmalade, Patrick

09:36.750 --> 09:40.082
Will you pass the marmalade
to Mr Casey?

09:40.166 --> 09:44.665
Always on Tuesdays,
if I recall correctly

09:44.750 --> 09:46.832
Thank you, Mr Nobbs

09:48.750 --> 09:52.082
- God, but isn't he a smasher?
- Who?

09:52.166 --> 09:55.457
- What's-his-name, the Viscount
- Not to mention rich

09:55.541 --> 09:58.624
Young and handsome
with money and land

09:58.708 --> 10:01.082
That's the kind of man l want

10:01.833 --> 10:04.874
I'll wear my new blouse tonight
and give him an eyeful

10:07.166 --> 10:10.874
Would you care for a tasty breast
of duck, my Lord?

10:10.958 --> 10:14.457
Pink and succulent
just the way you like it

10:17.375 --> 10:19.874
That's right, lower yourself

10:19.958 --> 10:22.540
The likes of him
would take advantage of a girl,

10:22.625 --> 10:23.999
then leave her high and dry

10:24.083 --> 10:26.957
High, maybe,
but I wouldn't say "dry"

10:27.041 --> 10:30.290
Girls, stop this tittle-tattling
and just get on with your breakfast

10:30.375 --> 10:34.249
It's no trouble at all, mind you

10:34.541 --> 10:36.999
- Morning, all
- Good morning

10:37.166 --> 10:42.124
Someone didn't bring me
my wake-up cuppa

10:43.750 --> 10:46.415
I'll have to lodge a complaint
with Mrs Baker

10:50.041 --> 10:52.749
- Morning, Nobbs
- Doctor

10:54.375 --> 10:58.749
- Did you know we have a Lord
and Lady staying? - ls that so?

10:59.666 --> 11:03.124
- What do you think? Any chance?
- l'm sorry, there's nothing here

11:03.208 --> 11:04.707
I was 2 years in The Ardlane

11:04.791 --> 11:07.749
- Maybe you should have stayed
there  - Well is there any

11:36.541 --> 11:38.540
- Good morning, Nobbs
- Hello, Nobbs

11:38.625 --> 11:41.874
Mistress Milly
Master George

12:18.750 --> 12:20.832
Bunny, breakfast

12:25.125 --> 12:26.790
Shall we wake the girls?

12:36.833 --> 12:39.707
Well, that hat's very important
Be careful with that

12:39.791 --> 12:43.082
Katie, get those sheets nice
and clean  Good girl

12:44.791 --> 12:50.915
- Are you the fellow about the
boiler for us? - l'm a boiler-man

12:51.000 --> 12:54.749
- You certainly took your sweet time
getting here  - Sorry, ma'am

12:54.833 --> 12:58.290
Mrs Baker's waiting inside
Come on inside, follow me

13:07.833 --> 13:12.249
- Mrs Baker  - Albert, Mr Hubert
Page is working in the morning,

13:12.333 --> 13:14.415
and he's come over
and asked us for a bed

13:14.500 --> 13:18.165
so l've told him he can muddle
in with you for one night

13:20.208 --> 13:22.582
With me, ma'am?

13:22.666 --> 13:25.249
Yes, Mr Nobbs, with you

13:25.333 --> 13:30.249
What?
What are you trying to say?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.499
- My bed is full of lumps
- Full of lumps?

13:37.291 --> 13:41.040
Your bed was re-picked
and buttoned just 6 months ago

13:41.125 --> 13:44.332
- What are you talking about?
- So it was, ma'am, so it was

13:44.416 --> 13:46.499
I'm a very light sleeper,

13:46.583 --> 13:48.540
and being sleepless might keep
Mr Page awake

13:48.625 --> 13:52.457
So I'm thinking he might be better
off on the sofa in the coffee room

13:52.541 --> 13:55.165
On the sofa? In the coffee room?

13:55.250 --> 13:57.957
I don't wish to be an inconvenience

13:58.041 --> 13:59.790
I'll keep myself warm
with a sharp walk

13:59.875 --> 14:03.124
You'll do nothing of the kind,
Mr Page

14:04.583 --> 14:06.790
Of course, Mrs Baker

14:06.875 --> 14:11.832
If Mr Page is pleased to share
my bed, he's welcome, l'm sure

14:11.916 --> 14:16.749
I should think so, indeed
Right, that's settled then

14:16.833 --> 14:21.332
Mrs Baker, ma'am  The man about
the boiler has just arrived

14:21.416 --> 14:23.915
Have you a letter from Holmans?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.415
Holmans? The plumbers?
No

14:26.500 --> 14:28.999
I thought you said
he was from Holmans?

14:29.083 --> 14:32.374
- Didn't they give you    - No,
I said nothing about Holmans

14:32.458 --> 14:35.374
- You said they gave you a letter
- l said I know about boilers

14:36.291 --> 14:39.124
And do you    know about boilers?

14:39.208 --> 14:44.165
I do, ma'am
I'm an apprentice boiler-man

14:45.083 --> 14:48.374
Well    since you're here,

14:48.458 --> 14:51.915
you might as well come and have
a look at the blessed thing

14:52.416 --> 14:55.915
- Thank you, Polly
- Thanks, ma'am

14:56.000 --> 14:57.790
Come on

15:03.708 --> 15:06.999
There now
It's the bane of our lives

15:07.083 --> 15:09.749
I'm depending on you to put
some manners on it

15:09.833 --> 15:12.207
We've our costume ball
tomorrow and

15:12.291 --> 15:16.124
it's of the utmost importance
that it's in full working order

15:21.500 --> 15:25.207
- l'll do my best, ma'am
- Right, then

15:25.958 --> 15:27.999
Goodnight, Mr Mackins

16:04.625 --> 16:06.332
Fucking thing

18:18.291 --> 18:20.082
Jesus

18:24.875 --> 18:29.707
- You're a woman  - You won't tell
on me, will you, Mr Page?

18:29.791 --> 18:33.457
- l'm on my knees
- Stop that

18:33.541 --> 18:37.790
I beg you
You won't tell on me, Mr Page?

18:37.875 --> 18:41.124
Stop a poor woman from making
a living  It will be the end of me

18:41.375 --> 18:44.624
- l don't wanna finish up
in the poorhouse  - Stop blubbering

18:44.708 --> 18:47.290
- No, no!
- Get up off the floor

18:47.375 --> 18:50.415
Get a hold of yourself! You'll wake
the entire fucking hotel!

18:50.500 --> 18:52.874
- You won't tell on me?
- Now stop with your noise!

19:00.000 --> 19:02.707
What were you doing jumping around
like that for anyway?

19:03.916 --> 19:06.457
There was a flea

19:09.166 --> 19:14.207
I'm a martyr to fleas  You must have
brought one in with you

19:14.291 --> 19:18.874
I'll be covered in blotches
in the morning

19:19.666 --> 19:24.499
All right, all right
Just get a hold of yourself

19:51.166 --> 19:53.124
So why are you dressed
like a fella?

19:53.208 --> 19:57.999
No-one would have suspected me
till the day of my death

19:58.083 --> 20:01.540
if it hadn't been for the flea
you brought with you

20:05.083 --> 20:09.207
So    Mr Nobbs

20:12.625 --> 20:14.415
what do you suggest we do now?

20:14.500 --> 20:17.457
As far as the sleeping arrangements
are concerned?

20:17.541 --> 20:19.624
Any ideas?

20:22.458 --> 20:27.249
Ah, go on, you take the bed
I'll go downstairs and find a sofa

20:27.333 --> 20:29.874
- No
- So what then?

20:29.958 --> 20:33.915
Mrs Baker will have my hide
if she finds out

20:34.000 --> 20:37.165
- You take the bed
- And where will you sleep?

20:37.250 --> 20:40.999
- Here  l don't mind
- Don't be pathetic

20:41.083 --> 20:46.665
No, please  l know her
Just promise you won't tell

20:48.416 --> 20:50.499
Jesus

20:54.166 --> 20:56.915
- All right
- You promise

20:57.000 --> 21:01.290
- you won't tell?
- Yes, l will promise anything

21:01.375 --> 21:03.957
I just need to get some sleep

21:04.708 --> 21:08.582
Here  Might as well make yourself
comfortable

21:08.666 --> 21:10.249
Have that

21:11.208 --> 21:15.415
God, I didn't ask to share
your bloody bed

21:52.500 --> 21:54.582
Bloody hell

22:59.916 --> 23:01.999
An hour late

23:02.083 --> 23:05.582
- Has 9 rung their bell yet?
- Yeah, a while ago

23:05.666 --> 23:09.040
Here
Good morning, Mr Nobbs

23:09.125 --> 23:11.082
How was your new bedfellow?

23:11.666 --> 23:13.624
I couldn't sleep, now I'm late

23:13.708 --> 23:16.665
Well l wouldn't worry my fat
about being late for one morning

23:16.750 --> 23:19.499
- Morning, Mr Nobbs
- Good morning, Mr

23:19.583 --> 23:21.874
Page  Hubert Page
Charmed to meet you

23:21.958 --> 23:24.957
- He's a shy one, our Mr Nobbs
- Oh, l know

23:25.583 --> 23:27.665
I'll bring the children's

23:43.166 --> 23:45.249
Mr Nobbs?

23:49.458 --> 23:51.915
Mrs Moore  She prefers roses

23:52.000 --> 23:55.665
- Lilies make her sneeze
- Oh, l see

23:55.750 --> 23:58.707
- Yes, well
- l heard yourself and Mr Page

23:58.791 --> 24:01.165
chattering away into the small hours

24:01.250 --> 24:03.665
He's a fine man, he is

24:05.416 --> 24:07.624
- Who?
- Mr Page

24:07.708 --> 24:12.790
- ls he married? - We didn't discuss
that sort of thing

24:13.458 --> 24:16.124
Then    what did "we" discuss?

24:22.666 --> 24:24.749
Horses

24:25.958 --> 24:28.207
Yes  Backing horses

24:28.291 --> 24:32.749
Mr Page is a great one for racing
and so on

24:35.166 --> 24:37.207
For horses

24:53.625 --> 24:56.957
A cup of tea, Mr Page?

24:58.916 --> 25:02.624
Do you know, Mr Nobbs,
I believe this house runs on tea

25:02.708 --> 25:06.540
I must have been offered 3 or 4 cups
of it already this morning

25:07.875 --> 25:09.957
Well, l wanted to

25:23.375 --> 25:27.332
- Will l take something
in to Mr Page? - Yes, good girl

25:27.416 --> 25:30.415
He wants to work through
and finish early

25:31.583 --> 25:33.832
I declare the smell of paint
from that laundry room

25:33.916 --> 25:35.540
is making me feel sick

25:35.625 --> 25:37.707
Oh, is it the morning sickness,
is it?

25:39.916 --> 25:42.957
You just think you're the funniest
thing on earth, Helen Dawes

25:43.291 --> 25:47.915
So, everyone,
this is Mr Joe Mackins

25:48.000 --> 25:50.374
He's worked all night long
and, believe it or not,

25:50.458 --> 25:52.290
he has tamed that boiler

25:52.375 --> 25:55.082
Oh, thank God for that

25:55.166 --> 25:58.582
I've been thinking that we need
a strong man about the house

25:58.666 --> 26:01.457
so l've asked Mr Mackins to stay on

26:01.541 --> 26:04.874
- Mr Nobbs    - Yes, Ma'am  - After
Mr Mackins has had something to eat,

26:04.958 --> 26:07.457
- would you show him
to the yard room? - Yes, ma'am

26:07.541 --> 26:10.665
Welcome to Morrison's, Mr Mackins

26:27.041 --> 26:30.165
Mrs Baker was talking
about a party tomorrow

26:30.250 --> 26:33.457
It's our fancy dress ball
We have it every year

26:33.541 --> 26:36.915
- We don't dress up  lt's only
for the guests  - That's a shame

26:37.000 --> 26:39.540
- Where are you from, then?
- Where are you from?

26:39.625 --> 26:41.707
- Can you not tell?
- Cork?

26:41.791 --> 26:44.665
Cork  Are you mad, are you?

26:44.750 --> 26:46.999
I am from Galway, of course

26:47.083 --> 26:49.540
I declare to my granny,
if you can't tell the difference

26:49.625 --> 26:52.207
Cork, Galway, it's all the same
to a Dublin man

26:52.291 --> 26:55.249
Oh, a Jackeen, are you?
Never would have known

26:55.333 --> 26:57.165
Born and bred in Sheriff Street,

26:57.250 --> 26:59.499
where no sheriff was ever known
to venture

27:09.791 --> 27:13.707
What delicacy have you got
for me this time, Mr Nobbs?

27:14.791 --> 27:18.832
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me

27:18.916 --> 27:22.832
It's just    it's just I'm afraid,

27:22.958 --> 27:26.415
you see    in case Mrs Baker

28:06.208 --> 28:08.290
Mr Nobbs

28:22.958 --> 28:25.665
- You're back
- Tea-time

28:25.750 --> 28:29.082
Jesus, Mary and Joseph
Not more tea

28:34.041 --> 28:36.582
Do you want to hear my story?

28:43.750 --> 28:45.457
There's not much to tell

28:45.541 --> 28:49.790
I was married,
to a house painter as it happens

28:49.875 --> 28:53.665
A drunk and a bully
One night he came home scuttered,

28:53.750 --> 28:56.415
gave me the usual hiding

28:56.500 --> 29:00.124
only this time he rounded it off
with an almighty kick

29:02.208 --> 29:04.290
and that was the end of that

29:04.916 --> 29:06.957
What did you do?

29:15.583 --> 29:20.457
I took his things and l left
This is his work coat

29:20.541 --> 29:24.499
I kept it all these years to
remember him by, the fecking waster

29:26.250 --> 29:29.415
- So you're still married?
- l am

29:37.875 --> 29:39.790
Her name's Cathleen

29:39.875 --> 29:41.874
Girls,
it's time to start the dinner

29:41.958 --> 29:44.665
Hubert Page, have you dealt
with that damp patch yet?

29:44.750 --> 29:47.124
You're a terrible slave driver,
Mrs Donaghue

29:47.208 --> 29:49.624
And you're just a big lazy man

30:00.291 --> 30:04.124
So    you married    a woman?

30:04.250 --> 30:08.082
I met a girl as lonely as myself

30:08.916 --> 30:12.624
And we fixed up to get a place,
sharing the rent and all that

30:12.708 --> 30:16.665
She had her dressmaking,
I had me work

30:16.750 --> 30:20.957
But people began to talk
so we got married

30:22.375 --> 30:24.499
- Well
- What's your name?

30:25.666 --> 30:28.124
- Albert
- Your real name

30:30.833 --> 30:32.915
Albert

30:39.708 --> 30:43.582
Listen, Mr Page,
I hear tell you're a betting man

30:44.875 --> 30:47.082
Have you a tip for Leopardstown
tomorrow?

30:47.166 --> 30:49.707
I'm in need of a winner
I lost my shirt

30:49.791 --> 30:52.874
on "Lightning Lad" in the Gold Cup

30:52.958 --> 30:55.332
Lightning, my arse

30:56.375 --> 31:00.499
You did a grand job, Mr Page
Very salubrious

31:00.583 --> 31:01.874
Thank you, ma'am

31:01.958 --> 31:04.707
If only l could afford
to have the whole place done

31:04.791 --> 31:07.749
Could you possibly tell me,
in your expert opinion

31:07.833 --> 31:09.915
how much do you think
it'd cost?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.790
What, to paint the whole interior?

31:11.875 --> 31:15.040
Well now  Let me think

31:17.416 --> 31:19.415
Well, there's all this out here

31:20.541 --> 31:23.332
And    the coffee room

31:28.750 --> 31:30.999
- ls that a dining room?
- Yes

31:31.250 --> 31:33.457
- And how many guest floors?
- Two

31:34.625 --> 31:37.374
Well, now it's only
an estimate but

31:37.458 --> 31:40.707
I'd say it couldn't be done
for under £200

31:40.791 --> 31:45.499
200? Oh, my
Aren't I the dreamer?

31:45.583 --> 31:48.457
I can't even afford a new boiler

31:49.250 --> 31:52.165
- Goodnight, Mr Page
- Goodnight, ma'am

31:52.625 --> 31:56.874
I'll dream of more salubrious rooms

32:04.291 --> 32:07.832
- Mr Page  - God
scared the be-jaysus out of me

32:07.916 --> 32:12.290
- How did you manage it?
- What? - To marry

32:13.333 --> 32:16.999
Easy  You could do it yourself

32:17.083 --> 32:21.249
- Waiter
- Mr Moore, sir

32:21.333 --> 32:23.999
Mrs Moore and l would like a glass
of sherry before dinner

32:24.083 --> 32:27.707
- Fetch a couple of glasses up
to the room, will you? - Yes, sir

32:38.416 --> 32:42.207
- lt's been a pleasure, Mrs
Donaghue  - Go on with the fairies

32:42.375 --> 32:45.707
- l'll be counting the minutes
- Ah, go on

33:06.666 --> 33:09.415
When did he tell
his wife he was a woman?

33:13.833 --> 33:15.915
Before the wedding?

33:16.791 --> 33:18.874
Or after?

33:33.083 --> 33:36.707
Did she say her wife
was a milliner?

33:41.208 --> 33:45.415
Sean, what in the name of God are
you doing letting Patrick up there?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.707
Come along down slowly

33:50.208 --> 33:52.665
Mr Mackins  Mr Mackins,
help us

33:52.750 --> 33:54.749
You're okay

33:54.833 --> 33:59.374
Patrick! What are you doing up those
ladders? That's really dangerous

33:59.458 --> 34:01.540
All right,
now everyone back to work

34:26.208 --> 34:28.749
Oh, wonderful!

34:33.291 --> 34:37.665
Ladies, ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please

34:38.791 --> 34:43.040
I now call upon the mistress
of the house

34:43.125 --> 34:47.540
to open the ball
Mrs Margaret Baker

34:47.625 --> 34:49.790
Hear hear!

35:49.000 --> 35:50.790
Come on  Bunny

36:54.000 --> 36:55.540
Get out!

37:17.208 --> 37:20.332
- Albert, my good man
- Doctor

37:22.583 --> 37:25.082
Why aren't you in fancy dress?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.999
Me, sir?

37:30.833 --> 37:33.124
Well    l'm a waiter

37:35.333 --> 37:37.415
And I'm a doctor

37:39.375 --> 37:43.040
We are both disguised as ourselves

37:45.625 --> 37:47.707
That's a good one, eh?

38:30.041 --> 38:32.457
- Now, tell me your name
- Let me go

38:32.541 --> 38:35.040
- What's your name?
- You're hurting me

38:46.208 --> 38:48.290
Wait!

38:49.250 --> 38:52.082
Helen  Helen Dawes

39:03.541 --> 39:05.624
Doctor Holloran

39:06.250 --> 39:08.332
Give me that now

39:26.083 --> 39:30.207
£514, 17 shillings and six pence

39:30.291 --> 39:32.374
Now

39:32.750 --> 39:37.582
7 pence and 1 , 2, 3 farthings

39:45.458 --> 39:50.040
In 6 months l could have £600

39:58.833 --> 40:00.915
Doctor

40:02.333 --> 40:05.040
Your morning cuppa, sir

40:07.333 --> 40:12.165
Suffering God, Albert
What was l drinking last night?

40:14.416 --> 40:16.499
Your tea, sir

40:19.125 --> 40:23.290
- Your Bushmills
- Oh, good man, Nobbs

40:23.708 --> 40:27.457
Let's have a drop, shall we?
For an eye-opener

40:29.458 --> 40:30.915
That's great

40:47.208 --> 40:49.290
Is everything all right, Albert?

40:50.666 --> 40:54.124
- Sir?
- ls there something on your mind?

40:54.208 --> 40:56.082
Oh, no, sir

41:01.000 --> 41:02.832
Well

41:03.875 --> 41:06.582
well, sir, the fact is

41:08.125 --> 41:10.207
I've been thinking

41:10.708 --> 41:14.082
- Thinking, are you?
- Yes, sir

41:14.375 --> 41:16.999
I've been thinking

41:17.541 --> 41:20.707
I might purchase a little business

41:21.000 --> 41:25.374
Ah, a business? Fancy that
Well, what kind of a business?

41:26.791 --> 41:30.915
Perhaps    a little shop

41:32.291 --> 41:35.332
Like what kind of a shop?

41:35.791 --> 41:38.540
I'm thinking maybe    tobacco

41:40.000 --> 41:43.624
Yes, a tobacconist's now,
that would suit a man

41:43.708 --> 41:47.249
But a woman could serve
at the counter?

41:47.333 --> 41:49.457
Yes, indeed, a woman could

41:55.000 --> 41:59.374
You're not thinking of taking
a wife, are you, Nobbs?

41:59.458 --> 42:01.332
Who's the lucky lady?

42:01.750 --> 42:06.332
- Good morning, Dr Holloran,
Mr Nobbs  - Good morning, Mary

42:08.208 --> 42:10.290
Get that out of your way there

42:16.458 --> 42:18.249
Women

42:40.708 --> 42:42.790
Hello, mister?

43:16.791 --> 43:21.332
2 counters
One for tobacco

43:21.416 --> 43:24.249
and things

43:24.541 --> 43:26.624
The other for sweetmeats

43:33.000 --> 43:37.790
There's a door behind
leading to the parlour

43:39.083 --> 43:41.457
The wife's parlour

43:54.625 --> 43:58.624
But where do Hubert
and Cathleen sleep?

44:02.916 --> 44:05.624
- Need a hand there, Mr Nobbs?
- No!

44:06.125 --> 44:08.582
All right  Don't lose your rag

44:08.958 --> 44:12.374
Lovely to see you again, ladies
You'll be back next year?

44:12.458 --> 44:14.540
Thank you, Mrs Baker

44:14.625 --> 44:18.374
There now  You know,
Albert will look after you

44:32.250 --> 44:36.040
Now she can have a clock
on a marble chimneypiece

45:11.500 --> 45:12.790
Yes?

45:17.416 --> 45:19.540
Mr Nobbs!

45:21.041 --> 45:24.040
I was    passing by

45:26.208 --> 45:28.165
Come in  Come in

45:35.958 --> 45:38.082
Cathleen, this is Mr Nobbs

45:38.166 --> 45:40.915
Mr Nobbs, my wife

45:42.708 --> 45:46.665
- Mrs Page
- Pleased to meet you, Mr Nobbs

45:50.625 --> 45:52.707
Well now

45:53.333 --> 45:55.707
we were just about to have
a bit of dinner, Mr Nobbs

45:55.791 --> 46:01.374
- Will you join us? - Oh, no,
thank you, Mrs Page  I wanted to

46:02.375 --> 46:06.665
to give you this
You left it in my

46:06.750 --> 46:08.915
in the room

46:09.000 --> 46:12.124
You came all this way
just to give me this?

46:12.208 --> 46:14.332
It's the button from my work coat

46:14.416 --> 46:17.999
And I didn't have another one
to match

46:18.083 --> 46:22.165
Well, you have averted
a veritable tragedy, Mr Nobbs

46:22.250 --> 46:25.874
For that you must certainly stay
and have your dinner with us

46:25.958 --> 46:28.874
Hubert, you take Mr Nobbs's coat
and hat

46:28.958 --> 46:31.790
I'll not have him standing
there like a stranger

46:51.500 --> 46:56.874
Well, l    I thought she'd be
different

46:56.958 --> 46:59.832
Cathleen? In what way?

47:00.916 --> 47:05.082
Well, she's    real

47:05.166 --> 47:07.457
Aye, she's real all right

47:09.458 --> 47:13.082
So you've been thinking about
my Cathleen, have you?

47:14.083 --> 47:18.165
Or how you might find a "Cathleen"
of your own?

47:22.375 --> 47:24.457
Sit down

47:35.875 --> 47:39.499
I thought you'd be dressed
as a woman at home

47:39.791 --> 47:43.415
And what if a neighbour passing by
happened to look in the window?

47:43.500 --> 47:47.540
So
you never wear a dress?

47:47.625 --> 47:51.249
It's safer this way
But l don't need to tell you that

47:52.625 --> 47:57.040
And anyway, it's not like we robbed
a bank or killed someone

48:02.375 --> 48:04.457
You know

48:08.416 --> 48:11.249
well I never gave you the chance
to tell your story

48:14.583 --> 48:17.499
So why don't you tell me now?

48:26.583 --> 48:29.290
I don't know the beginning

48:36.625 --> 48:38.707
I was a

48:39.625 --> 48:41.707
bastard

48:46.375 --> 48:50.957
Mrs Nobbs    the woman
who was paid to raise me

48:51.041 --> 48:54.249
she knew who l was
but she never told me

48:54.708 --> 48:59.582
Maybe she would have one day but
she died, suddenly

48:59.666 --> 49:03.457
- Without telling you who you are?
- Yes

49:04.375 --> 49:08.332
She gave me a picture of a lady
she said was my mother

49:08.416 --> 49:12.082
and she hinted, more than once,

49:12.166 --> 49:15.540
that my people were grand folk

49:16.666 --> 49:20.665
I got a convent education
because of a big allowance

49:20.750 --> 49:24.499
from my mother's family
but one day the Reverend Mother

49:24.583 --> 49:29.165
told us that my mother was dead
and we had to leave

49:29.250 --> 49:34.790
So we went to live in Seven Dials,
had to go find work

49:36.000 --> 49:40.957
Thought I'd die living amongst
such rough people  They were poor,

49:41.833 --> 49:45.999
living like animals  lndecently

49:46.708 --> 49:50.415
Life without decency is unbearable

49:52.791 --> 49:55.499
Then Mrs Nobbs died

49:56.458 --> 50:00.165
- And you were what age?
- 14

50:05.125 --> 50:09.707
So    you decided to become a man?

50:22.375 --> 50:24.457
One night

50:25.875 --> 50:27.957
there was

50:30.291 --> 50:32.249
there was 5 of them

50:33.041 --> 50:36.082
They caught me and they

50:37.833 --> 50:40.332
they pulled me about

50:42.583 --> 50:44.665
It was under the stairs

50:51.666 --> 50:53.749
They hurt me

50:59.416 --> 51:03.249
Then they    they left me there

51:07.708 --> 51:12.207
Soon after that I heard
there was to be a big dinner

51:12.291 --> 51:16.999
at the Freemasons Hall and
that they were short of waiters

51:19.541 --> 51:24.540
And back then my figure was just
right for a waiter, so

51:26.958 --> 51:31.707
I managed to get a second-hand
suit of clothes

51:31.791 --> 51:33.874
an evening suit

51:35.708 --> 51:37.832
I didn't think they'd hire me

51:37.916 --> 51:41.832
but they were short-handed
and I got the job

51:43.875 --> 51:46.374
I was paid 10 shillings

51:53.833 --> 51:55.915
That was it

52:03.333 --> 52:07.832
Since then l've served round tables
of all the biggest places in

52:07.916 --> 52:11.207
in London and Manchester,
Liverpool

52:11.625 --> 52:13.707
Then

52:16.000 --> 52:18.707
then l came to Morrison's

52:22.416 --> 52:23.749
Right, you men, up you get

52:23.833 --> 52:27.082
before everything on the table
is stone cold

52:30.458 --> 52:35.457
"Oh, very salubrious, Mr Page
Very salubrious "

52:36.583 --> 52:40.707
Salubrious? Who does she think
she is? The Queen of England?

52:40.791 --> 52:44.832
I'd love to get a squint at her
The old trout

52:57.333 --> 53:01.624
Must be nice, though, Mr Nobbs,
working in a hotel

53:01.708 --> 53:05.249
Always something happening
Something to give you a laugh

53:18.541 --> 53:20.624
Yesterday

53:21.083 --> 53:24.665
Sean Casey fell down
the coal-hole steps

53:25.458 --> 53:28.040
And who may I ask is Sean Casey?

53:28.125 --> 53:30.207
He's one of the waiters

53:31.291 --> 53:34.915
- And did he hurt himself?
- He got a black-eye

53:35.000 --> 53:38.207
A black-eye? In the coal-hole

53:41.583 --> 53:43.665
You're funny

53:46.000 --> 53:50.165
You'd better learn how to do this if
you're going to open a tobacco shop

53:50.250 --> 53:53.165
So we were speaking of Morrison's

53:53.250 --> 53:57.832
That Helen Dawes
she's a fine girl

53:57.916 --> 54:00.624
She's the life of the place, she is

54:03.166 --> 54:06.374
Helen, is it?
That's not the first time

54:06.458 --> 54:08.540
that name's been heard
in this house, Mr Nobbs

54:08.625 --> 54:12.540
Hubert took quite a shine to her
Didn't you now?

54:12.916 --> 54:14.915
Look at you, you're all thumbs
Give it to me

54:15.000 --> 54:17.957
I'm just saying, if one day
you should take it into your head

54:18.041 --> 54:20.165
to run off to America

54:20.250 --> 54:22.624
I might indeed try my luck
with Miss Dawes

54:22.708 --> 54:24.374
How could you deny
that sweet little face

54:24.458 --> 54:28.832
and all those lovely blonde
curls? She's gorgeous

54:28.916 --> 54:30.999
"Try my luck", is it?

54:31.083 --> 54:33.332
Well, l wouldn't be getting
my hopes up, Hubert Page

54:33.416 --> 54:36.499
because I've no intentions
of budging from this spot

54:36.583 --> 54:38.749
There you go, Mr Nobbs

54:54.375 --> 54:57.374
A shop is a sound idea, Albert

54:57.458 --> 55:01.540
You've been shrewd the way you've
saved your money all these years

55:01.625 --> 55:03.290
I haven't enough yet

55:03.375 --> 55:06.540
You've it all stashed under
the mattress, is it, Mr Nobbs?

55:07.791 --> 55:11.207
Easy now, little fella
Would you fetch some water?

55:11.291 --> 55:13.874
Are you all right?

55:15.541 --> 55:19.874
My Da, now there was a boozer
A fierce hoor for the drink

55:19.958 --> 55:24.374
None of us ever slept
We'd be lying there

55:24.458 --> 55:27.874
shivering with the fright,
waiting for him to come home

55:27.958 --> 55:32.332
Knowing that if he did
there'd be no place to hide

55:36.458 --> 55:38.874
You'd get up in the morning
with no memory of the beating

55:38.958 --> 55:41.332
the night before

55:44.875 --> 55:47.582
You know what kept me
from killing him?

55:47.666 --> 55:49.749
What?

55:50.333 --> 55:54.165
The thoughts of getting on a boat
and hopping it to America

57:23.291 --> 57:27.499
- Good evening, Miss Dawes
- Evening, Mr Nobbs

57:31.708 --> 57:33.790
Miss Dawes

57:44.916 --> 57:49.040
I was wondering, Miss Dawes, if you
would care to come out for a walk?

57:49.125 --> 57:51.999
Pardon me, Mr Nobbs?

57:53.625 --> 57:58.124
I'm off duty at 3 tomorrow
and if you're not engaged

57:58.208 --> 58:00.624
"Engaged"?

58:00.708 --> 58:04.832
No, l'm not engaged, Mr Nobbs,
but

58:06.458 --> 58:11.290
- Are you asking me to walk out?
- l am

58:15.000 --> 58:17.082
Well

58:17.500 --> 58:20.582
the thing is l'm walking out
with Joe Mackins

58:20.666 --> 58:25.415
I don't know what he'd say
if I started walking out with you

58:26.000 --> 58:27.790
Ah, yes

58:31.750 --> 58:36.332
- Goodnight, Miss Dawes
- Mr Nobbs

58:41.458 --> 58:43.665
He asked you to go for a walk?

58:43.750 --> 58:47.124
That's a good one  The sly old dog

58:51.333 --> 58:55.374
- Why don't you go for a walk
with the charmer, then? - What?

58:55.458 --> 58:59.665
Why not?
There's a whiff of money off him

59:00.375 --> 59:04.624
Maybe he could take you out
Have a good time

59:06.416 --> 59:10.749
- What about you?
- l'm not the jealous type

59:13.166 --> 59:15.249
Come here to me, Helen Dawes

59:15.333 --> 59:17.165
If he lays a hand on you,

59:17.250 --> 59:21.165
I'd wring his scrawny neck,
so help me I will

59:25.041 --> 59:28.749
Poke him up
See what he's after

59:29.791 --> 59:33.165
Get him to take you somewhere fancy

59:33.250 --> 59:37.582
Get him to buy you something
sweet    like yourself

59:40.791 --> 59:45.957
Be sure not to keep him waiting
Oh no, not for me  Not for Joseph

1:00:07.666 --> 1:00:09.499
Were you afraid l wasn't coming?

1:00:10.666 --> 1:00:12.499
Not very

1:00:25.291 --> 1:00:29.374
Did you see that one?
Did you see that dress?

1:00:29.458 --> 1:00:32.415
5 guineas if it was a penny

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:34.790
- 5 guineas?!
- At least

1:00:37.958 --> 1:00:41.499
Lord, l love the smell
of roasting coffee

1:00:45.416 --> 1:00:47.499
Would you like to go in?

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.999
All right

1:01:05.916 --> 1:01:10.457
Look at the chocolates
Aren't they gorgeous?

1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:14.540
I'm afraid they cost a lot

1:01:15.333 --> 1:01:19.707
Oh, well
let's go somewhere else

1:01:20.458 --> 1:01:24.082
- Somewhere cheaper
- No  Please

1:01:55.666 --> 1:01:59.832
- May I help you?
- We'd like some chocolate, please

1:01:59.916 --> 1:02:01.999
What kind of chocolate?

1:02:03.041 --> 1:02:05.374
Just    chocolate

1:02:05.458 --> 1:02:08.374
Dark chocolate? Milk chocolate?
Creams, caramels?

1:02:08.458 --> 1:02:13.582
- Nougat? Nuts?
- No, a box of chocolates

1:02:14.375 --> 1:02:17.749
- To take with us?
- Oh, to take with you

1:02:17.833 --> 1:02:22.665
- And not something to drink?
- No  A box of chocolates

1:02:22.750 --> 1:02:25.749
- One of those
- Which one?

1:02:27.083 --> 1:02:30.957
- Which one?
- That one  With the 2 ladies

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:36.832
Oh no, wait  That one
With the soldier and the lady

1:02:36.916 --> 1:02:40.374
Wait  l can't decide

1:02:42.958 --> 1:02:46.665
then my Da died
and I had to go out to work

1:02:46.750 --> 1:02:48.749
First l was in service,

1:02:48.833 --> 1:02:51.457
then l served behind the counter
of a shop for a while

1:02:54.375 --> 1:02:59.540
- ln a shop?
- Yes  ln a draper's

1:03:00.291 --> 1:03:05.374
Treated like dirt by any bloody
bitch with six pence to spend

1:03:05.458 --> 1:03:09.415
- Where did you live?
- l had my own room

1:03:11.208 --> 1:03:16.165
- Above the shop?
- Yes, above the shop

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.707
Do you know what, Mr Nobbs?

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:29.499
I think you are the strangest man
I've ever met

1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:34.832
Chocolates, 3 shillings, six pence

1:03:34.916 --> 1:03:38.207
So if every time we walk out
it'd cost three and six

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:40.540
14 shillings a month

1:03:40.625 --> 1:03:45.790
Twice  That's 28 shillings a month
2 boxes a week

1:03:45.875 --> 1:03:50.040
At this rate, £16,
6 shillings a year

1:03:50.416 --> 1:03:52.499
Oh Lord

1:04:25.708 --> 1:04:29.999
Perhaps I only need to court her
for 3 months

1:04:50.333 --> 1:04:52.415
Here

1:04:52.750 --> 1:04:55.957
- ls this the best you could do?
- At least he bought me something

1:04:56.041 --> 1:04:58.415
Look at you, Miss High and Mighty

1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:00.290
Old Albert put ideas in your head,
did he?

1:05:00.375 --> 1:05:04.040
You should have seen him pay for it
Blood from a turnip

1:05:04.125 --> 1:05:06.624
So he's sweet on you then?

1:05:07.583 --> 1:05:09.582
- Well, next time
- Next time?

1:05:09.666 --> 1:05:12.749
Ask him for, I don't know,
a bottle of something

1:05:12.833 --> 1:05:15.957
- What sort of "something"?
- Whiskey

1:05:16.083 --> 1:05:19.290
A good bottle of malt
I like a drop of malt

1:05:19.375 --> 1:05:21.749
Say    say it's for your brother

1:05:21.833 --> 1:05:24.332
- l haven't got a brother
- Well, he won't know that

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.957
I've walked out before but never
with the likes of Albert Nobbs

1:05:30.041 --> 1:05:33.332
- He's a freak is what he is
- He has manners, at least

1:05:33.416 --> 1:05:35.624
Not like some people
I could mention

1:05:35.708 --> 1:05:40.374
- His manners won't get you
to America, will they? - What?

1:05:42.083 --> 1:05:44.457
I may not have manners

1:05:46.625 --> 1:05:49.165
but I swear I'm getting us
out of here

1:05:51.416 --> 1:05:54.124
There's no hope for us here, Helen

1:05:56.083 --> 1:05:57.665
None

1:06:00.250 --> 1:06:05.874
All my life l've dreamed of getting
out  Nothing's gonna stop me

1:06:07.083 --> 1:06:09.832
America's the only place
for people like me

1:06:09.916 --> 1:06:14.499
Over there, I'd learn fast and I'd
work hard and we could have a life

1:06:17.875 --> 1:06:20.582
Will you chance it with me?

1:06:22.916 --> 1:06:24.540
Will you?

1:06:26.666 --> 1:06:28.749
Yes

1:06:30.041 --> 1:06:34.332
I love you, Joe
I love you

1:06:37.541 --> 1:06:40.665
- Why are we going this way?
- You'll see

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:44.207
Can we not stop and have a cup
of tea somewhere?

1:06:44.291 --> 1:06:47.207
My heels are raw,
we've walked that far

1:06:52.833 --> 1:06:54.915
What's this?

1:06:55.583 --> 1:06:58.999
Just imagine blue doors,

1:06:59.083 --> 1:07:01.832
cream walls inside

1:07:01.916 --> 1:07:04.832
Nice curtains
on the upstairs windows

1:07:04.916 --> 1:07:10.874
Up there a sign
"Tobacconist - A Nobbs"

1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:13.582
What do you think?

1:07:17.083 --> 1:07:21.249
Now it's big enough for a shop
And for

1:07:23.208 --> 1:07:28.040
for    people    to live above

1:07:31.250 --> 1:07:33.290
It's a very desirable property

1:07:33.375 --> 1:07:36.624
and can only appreciate
The agent said so

1:07:36.708 --> 1:07:41.665
In 15 years, it will fetch 3 times
what it's worth now

1:07:42.166 --> 1:07:47.499
Sell up then,
move to some place by the sea

1:07:48.333 --> 1:07:51.665
I've always wanted to live
by the sea

1:07:52.916 --> 1:07:56.624
You haven't moved in and you've
already got yourself retired

1:07:56.708 --> 1:08:00.582
I just, l just wanted to show it
to you

1:08:00.750 --> 1:08:03.249
You asked me to come out with you

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:06.999
you walk me off my feet
and we end up in this back alley

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:11.290
I've spent my life trying to get out
of holes like this

1:08:12.458 --> 1:08:14.249
Helen?

1:08:16.583 --> 1:08:21.082
Please, take me back  I'm tired

1:08:26.958 --> 1:08:30.082
Thanks for the bottle

1:08:32.250 --> 1:08:34.665
And the hat?

1:08:35.708 --> 1:08:38.582
Oh, yes  Thank you

1:08:42.541 --> 1:08:44.874
- Where does he live?
- Who?

1:08:45.250 --> 1:08:47.957
- Your brother
- My brother?

1:08:48.375 --> 1:08:50.290
Oh, my brother

1:08:51.666 --> 1:08:56.874
In Mallow
But he often comes up to Dublin

1:09:04.375 --> 1:09:09.249
Joe?

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:17.832
Joe Mackins  You nearly made me
wet meself

1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:23.499
- Here
- What's this?

1:09:24.208 --> 1:09:28.040
Well, well
His nibs coughed up, did he?

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:34.290
This is good stuff  Good girl

1:09:41.541 --> 1:09:44.582
- See if you can screw a few quid
out of him  - A few quid?

1:09:44.666 --> 1:09:46.832
The first one's always the hardest

1:09:46.916 --> 1:09:48.915
But after that it's like
shelling peas

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.915
You don't know Albert Nobbs
if you think

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.457
we can get him to pay
our way out of here

1:09:53.541 --> 1:09:55.582
He wouldn't give you
the steam off his water

1:09:55.666 --> 1:09:57.790
He bought you those chocolates,
didn't he?

1:09:57.875 --> 1:09:59.957
And now this

1:10:04.958 --> 1:10:07.040
Oh, and that hat

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:12.707
See you've got him hooked

1:10:17.166 --> 1:10:19.249
Has he tried any

1:10:21.458 --> 1:10:23.540
- What?
- You know

1:10:30.625 --> 1:10:33.624
Next time you go out with him

1:10:34.375 --> 1:10:38.499
work him up a bit
See what he's made of

1:10:38.583 --> 1:10:40.832
See if there's a sting in him

1:10:40.916 --> 1:10:43.040
I'm not going out with him any more

1:10:43.125 --> 1:10:46.499
Well how else are we gonna get
to America?

1:10:47.458 --> 1:10:49.874
You're gonna walk out with him as
long as there's a bob in his pocket

1:10:49.958 --> 1:10:52.415
and you've a hand to pull it out!

1:11:01.958 --> 1:11:04.040
Come back tonight

1:11:11.083 --> 1:11:13.165
Should l

1:11:13.958 --> 1:11:16.874
tell her before we're married

1:11:17.333 --> 1:11:19.707
or save it for the wedding night?

1:11:23.625 --> 1:11:28.415
She might call the police
Take us both to the station

1:11:31.291 --> 1:11:36.915
If only l'd been able to ask Hubert
how she did it

1:11:39.333 --> 1:11:42.332
She was like this when we came in

1:11:43.958 --> 1:11:47.165
- ls she going to die?
- Has anybody else been here?

1:11:47.250 --> 1:11:48.915
No, only us

1:11:51.416 --> 1:11:55.582
Leave her with me  And wash
your hands  Scrub them in carbolic

1:11:55.666 --> 1:11:59.165
Mother of God, is it the fever?
Is it?

1:12:00.666 --> 1:12:04.290
Go on  Don't say anything
to anybody  l'll talk to Mrs Baker

1:12:05.750 --> 1:12:07.874
And wash your hands

1:12:24.541 --> 1:12:26.624
Never mind

1:12:31.625 --> 1:12:34.207
Amelia, for God's sake

1:12:35.083 --> 1:12:38.374
Come along
Come along,

1:12:38.833 --> 1:12:40.457
pick up your feet

1:12:40.541 --> 1:12:44.290
Monsieur Pigot  I insist you not go
without paying your bill

1:12:44.375 --> 1:12:47.499
Send it on
Come! Quick! Quick!

1:12:47.583 --> 1:12:51.415
Where is my Patrick?
Why isn't he here?

1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:55.374
Who are you?
Everything's impossible

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:59.332
There's only one young one who died
She was sick before she came here

1:12:59.416 --> 1:13:02.665
This is entirely in the public
interest  l'm sorry

1:13:02.750 --> 1:13:05.832
You're destroying me

1:13:44.250 --> 1:13:46.207
Mr Nobbs?

1:14:36.666 --> 1:14:38.749
Joe?

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:45.040
- There's something l have to tell
you  - What "something"?

1:14:50.875 --> 1:14:52.874
Is this something l want to hear?

1:14:55.708 --> 1:14:57.915
I'm expecting

1:15:00.541 --> 1:15:02.624
I'm gonna have a baby

1:15:33.166 --> 1:15:35.540
I'm sorry

1:16:09.791 --> 1:16:11.874
I'll take care of you

1:16:17.375 --> 1:16:20.874
Don't you worry  Come here

1:16:53.916 --> 1:16:57.832
I'm ruined  Finished

1:16:59.291 --> 1:17:02.665
You do have a great gift
for exaggeration, Duchess

1:17:02.750 --> 1:17:05.957
I'm mortgaged up to my ears

1:17:06.041 --> 1:17:09.457
I've an office full of unpaid bills
And

1:17:10.166 --> 1:17:13.374
And if the guests are afraid
to return, l

1:17:15.541 --> 1:17:18.957
Come on, Madge  You'll rise again

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:27.499
I surely would have perished
without you

1:17:36.625 --> 1:17:40.540
- Good morning, Mr N  - Sweet Jesus
and all the saints in heaven

1:17:40.625 --> 1:17:43.832
Mr Nobbs!
Will you eat something?

1:17:46.125 --> 1:17:49.457
- Have you some porridge?
- Yes  Of course

1:17:50.250 --> 1:17:55.040
Mr Nobbs  Thank the Lord
you're well again

1:17:57.125 --> 1:17:59.457
Is Helen safe?

1:17:59.541 --> 1:18:03.749
Oh yes, she's all right
Blooming, you could say

1:18:04.666 --> 1:18:07.040
The fever never touched her

1:18:08.416 --> 1:18:12.082
- And the others?
- My Patrick,

1:18:12.166 --> 1:18:14.457
my Patrick's gone

1:18:17.125 --> 1:18:19.249
Hundreds of others in town

1:18:19.333 --> 1:18:22.415
They don't even know
how many in the country

1:19:25.750 --> 1:19:27.832
What am l going to do?

1:19:29.291 --> 1:19:31.374
Mr Page

1:19:33.166 --> 1:19:37.832
the two of us could always
set up together

1:19:39.916 --> 1:19:45.957
Well, l mean    perhaps
we could pool our money

1:19:46.041 --> 1:19:51.165
and buy a bigger shop
And we could run it together

1:19:51.791 --> 1:19:54.915
Just like you and Cathleen did

1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:58.790
Or you could keep
at the house painting

1:19:58.875 --> 1:20:01.665
and I could run the shop

1:20:04.250 --> 1:20:06.332
What are you saying?

1:20:08.583 --> 1:20:10.665
Perhaps

1:20:12.166 --> 1:20:15.915
I could live here  Like Cathleen

1:20:18.666 --> 1:20:21.457
Neither of us would be alone

1:20:25.375 --> 1:20:27.457
You can'tjust

1:20:37.291 --> 1:20:39.374
She was my world

1:20:46.583 --> 1:20:48.665
We loved each other

1:20:55.750 --> 1:20:57.624
Come with me

1:21:11.333 --> 1:21:13.999
She made them all herself

1:21:28.666 --> 1:21:30.499
They're very beautiful

1:21:32.666 --> 1:21:35.249
I can't remember what it's like

1:24:01.958 --> 1:24:04.040
Albert

1:24:04.916 --> 1:24:08.499
You don't have to be anything
but who you are

1:24:09.541 --> 1:24:13.249
Look at how you've survived
all these years

1:24:13.333 --> 1:24:16.124
You've worked hard and you've saved
your money

1:24:16.541 --> 1:24:19.999
So if you want to go out and find
someone to start a new life with

1:24:20.083 --> 1:24:22.999
then you go out and find
that person

1:24:25.541 --> 1:24:29.082
- l didn't say that, Joe  - I'm not
deaf, am l? I know what you said

1:24:29.166 --> 1:24:33.249
- But why would l ever say that?
- Because it's what you're thinking

1:24:33.333 --> 1:24:35.665
- That's not fair, Joe
- Well tell me what's fair? Come on

1:24:35.750 --> 1:24:39.624
Tell me  Tell me
what you think is fair

1:24:39.708 --> 1:24:42.165
- l'm all ears  Tell me
- You don't care what I think

1:24:42.250 --> 1:24:44.999
Nothing in this whole bloody place,
that's what!

1:24:45.083 --> 1:24:49.332
Now good dog  Good, good dog

1:24:50.208 --> 1:24:52.707
All right, Mr N?

1:24:56.791 --> 1:24:58.874
Are you all right?

1:25:12.250 --> 1:25:14.540
She's not worth it, you know

1:25:16.291 --> 1:25:19.540
She's just full
of that Joe Mackins

1:25:19.625 --> 1:25:23.374
and he's a waster,
if ever l met one

1:25:24.250 --> 1:25:27.332
And he's put her in the family way

1:25:27.416 --> 1:25:30.540
And now they're talking
about going to America

1:25:30.625 --> 1:25:33.082
That's complete pshaw

1:25:33.916 --> 1:25:36.332
Mark my words

1:25:37.083 --> 1:25:39.499
he'll never take her

1:25:39.583 --> 1:25:43.540
Not now  Not ever

1:26:21.333 --> 1:26:25.624
It's a pity this place
isn't nearer Morrison's

1:26:26.625 --> 1:26:30.749
You think we'd be allowed out
to walk in it if it was?

1:26:30.833 --> 1:26:33.040
It'd be Lord and Lady Snot

1:26:33.125 --> 1:26:38.124
swanking it up and down the grass
Not you and me

1:26:42.291 --> 1:26:45.499
You and Joe have been down
to the sea, haven't you?

1:26:47.208 --> 1:26:51.999
- And what if we have?
- l don't think it's right

1:26:52.083 --> 1:26:56.124
for a girl to be keeping company
with 2 fellows

1:26:56.208 --> 1:26:59.165
- And l thought
- What did you think?

1:27:01.416 --> 1:27:05.165
That you didn't care for me enough

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.082
Enough for what?

1:27:08.875 --> 1:27:12.499
We've been walking out so-called
for a while now

1:27:12.583 --> 1:27:15.165
It's not natural to be just talking

1:27:15.250 --> 1:27:18.249
Never wanting to put your arm
around a girl's waist

1:27:18.333 --> 1:27:20.374
But that's for when we're married

1:27:20.458 --> 1:27:22.540
Married?

1:27:23.666 --> 1:27:27.499
This is the first time you've said
anything about getting married

1:27:27.583 --> 1:27:32.332
I've put a deposit on the shop
A hundred pounds

1:27:32.416 --> 1:27:35.290
The agent says he has another offer

1:27:35.375 --> 1:27:38.540
and that we have till Monday
to decide

1:27:38.625 --> 1:27:42.457
- After that we'll lose the deposit
- "We"?

1:27:43.833 --> 1:27:46.457
We'll make a great success
of our shop

1:27:46.541 --> 1:27:52.540
People will be coming to see us
Having tea with us in the parlour

1:27:52.625 --> 1:27:57.665
And our wedding will be a great
wonder

1:27:58.916 --> 1:28:03.249
"A great wonder"?
Oh, it would be that all right

1:28:03.333 --> 1:28:06.999
Sometimes I think you're soft
in the head  Did you know that?

1:28:07.083 --> 1:28:11.665
What kind of man would ask
a girl to marry him

1:28:11.750 --> 1:28:13.582
without having so much
as kissed her?

1:28:13.666 --> 1:28:16.582
You must not love me
if you don't want to kiss me

1:28:16.666 --> 1:28:20.832
I don't want to marry a man
who isn't in love with me

1:28:24.958 --> 1:28:27.040
I do love you

1:28:36.916 --> 1:28:39.082
You call that kissing?

1:28:47.875 --> 1:28:50.374
That's the way people in love kiss

1:28:50.750 --> 1:28:53.207
That's the way Joe Mackins
kisses me

1:28:53.291 --> 1:28:58.457
That's the way l like to be kissed
I'm going home

1:28:59.666 --> 1:29:01.665
Helen

1:29:01.750 --> 1:29:04.207
- Helen, wait
- You're a fool of a man

1:29:04.291 --> 1:29:07.499
If you think me a fool of a man,
why did you walk out with me?

1:29:07.583 --> 1:29:10.707
I don't know why  l wish l hadn't

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:13.665
Anyway, you don't have to worry
about that any more

1:29:13.750 --> 1:29:17.124
What do you mean?
Please, Helen, wait

1:29:17.208 --> 1:29:19.207
What about the shoes and stockings
I ordered for you?

1:29:19.291 --> 1:29:21.374
- What shall I do with them?
- l'll take the stockings

1:29:21.458 --> 1:29:23.124
- And the shoes?
- And the shoes

1:29:23.208 --> 1:29:25.832
And you'll wear them
when you walk out with Joe Mackins?

1:29:25.916 --> 1:29:31.374
He won't take you to America  He'll
leave you here  You and the baby

1:29:31.458 --> 1:29:33.540
He will, he'll leave you

1:29:34.750 --> 1:29:37.874
No  He will not leave me

1:29:37.958 --> 1:29:40.332
- You'll be safe with me
- He will not leave me

1:29:40.416 --> 1:29:43.624
- l'll take care of you both
- Stop it!

1:29:43.708 --> 1:29:45.790
Why do you say that?

1:30:18.541 --> 1:30:20.999
It's snowing

1:30:22.958 --> 1:30:27.165
Don't worry about the hat
I'll buy you another one

1:30:28.208 --> 1:30:30.290
No

1:30:32.125 --> 1:30:34.207
Goodbye

1:31:14.458 --> 1:31:19.540
Your Ladyship!
How wonderful to see you back

1:31:19.625 --> 1:31:21.624
Miss Shaw

1:31:21.708 --> 1:31:23.832
I've put you in your usual rooms

1:31:25.750 --> 1:31:29.165
There now
Joseph will look after you

1:31:29.416 --> 1:31:33.582
Get out of my way  Out of the way

1:31:35.583 --> 1:31:38.874
Hop to it, you lazy fellow
Hop to it!

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.082
What's that?

1:32:10.875 --> 1:32:14.332
Oh, I never eat anything blue,
please take it away

1:32:19.708 --> 1:32:24.374
Am l the last to know?
I'll throw her out, brazen hussy

1:32:24.458 --> 1:32:29.290
- l'll throw them both out, by God
I will  - You'll do no such thing

1:33:23.083 --> 1:33:25.165
I can't do it, Helen

1:33:26.208 --> 1:33:28.582
I hate myself for it
but I can't do it

1:33:28.666 --> 1:33:30.749
It's the same old story
and you know it

1:33:30.833 --> 1:33:34.415
How many times have you seen
it happen?

1:33:37.250 --> 1:33:39.582
- lt shouldn't have happened
- But it did happen

1:33:39.666 --> 1:33:41.749
Yeah, but it happened too soon!

1:33:45.250 --> 1:33:47.332
It'll change us

1:33:48.583 --> 1:33:50.665
It'll change me

1:33:52.666 --> 1:33:54.832
And I don't wanna be that person

1:33:57.125 --> 1:33:59.332
I don't wanna be my fucking Da!

1:34:01.750 --> 1:34:04.207
I can't even fucking read

1:34:07.625 --> 1:34:10.790
What have you done to us?
You've ruined everything

1:34:10.875 --> 1:34:13.665
Just listen to what you're saying
You can't leave!

1:34:13.750 --> 1:34:17.249
You wouldn't let me go
and now you say it's all my fault?

1:34:17.333 --> 1:34:20.415
- But I didn't mean that, Helen
- What didn't you mean?

1:34:20.500 --> 1:34:25.290
After everything you've told me,
promised me  What didn't you mean?

1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:35.499
- Helen  - There's nothing more
to say  Please, go away

1:34:35.583 --> 1:34:37.582
Wait  Marry me

1:34:37.666 --> 1:34:41.874
I'll take care of you
The two of you  You and the child

1:34:41.958 --> 1:34:43.874
He'll never take you to America

1:34:43.958 --> 1:34:46.665
- What do you know, you miserable
little prick? - Joe, stop it

1:34:46.750 --> 1:34:48.249
You were all talk just now

1:34:48.333 --> 1:34:51.374
- Why don't you say to me what you're
saying to her? - Joe, stop it!

1:34:51.458 --> 1:34:53.874
You won't take her to America

1:34:53.958 --> 1:34:58.124
- lt's none of your
fucking business  - Joe  Stop, Joe

1:34:59.166 --> 1:35:02.790
- Let me go
- Don't you hurt her!

1:35:06.458 --> 1:35:11.374
For God's sake, Joe
You'll have the Peelers on us

1:35:11.458 --> 1:35:14.582
- Get a hold of yourself
- Get your hands off me!

1:36:04.333 --> 1:36:08.207
- You did this to us  - You're
a boozer  Just like your father

1:36:08.291 --> 1:36:12.374
I'm not like that bastard! Get your
paws off me, you fucking nancy boy

1:36:12.458 --> 1:36:16.499
- l'll smash your fucking face!
- l don't want you any more!

1:36:20.833 --> 1:36:22.957
I don't want you

1:36:39.416 --> 1:36:42.082
- Joe
- Helen, no, no

1:36:42.750 --> 1:36:44.332
Let, let me go

1:36:44.416 --> 1:36:47.665
Let him go

1:37:21.041 --> 1:37:23.207
Mr Nobbs?

1:38:30.708 --> 1:38:35.249
Coal, Lucy  Lucy, would you go
downstairs and get the coal

1:38:35.875 --> 1:38:40.374
A big load of coal, this has got
to be kept red hot for my cooking

1:38:42.125 --> 1:38:44.915
Now here's the black pudding

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.415
Now, which room ordered kippers?
Was it 7 or 9?

1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:51.832
- 7  - Good girl
Get me a plate for the kippers

1:38:51.916 --> 1:38:54.415
Now we've got everything else
Chicken livers, bacon,

1:38:54.500 --> 1:38:56.290
black pudding,

1:38:56.375 --> 1:39:00.874
prune, sausages, jam, milk
Yeah, we've got everything

1:39:13.416 --> 1:39:37.957
Mr Nobbs?

1:39:44.875 --> 1:39:46.957
Albert?

1:39:54.250 --> 1:39:56.707
Oh, that's fine
I'll take it from here

1:41:04.375 --> 1:41:06.457
Oh, Albert Nobbs

1:41:34.666 --> 1:41:39.624
Jesus, I don't know what makes
people live such miserable lives

1:42:16.875 --> 1:42:19.540
Oh my God

1:42:36.583 --> 1:42:41.040
- Albert Nobbs, a woman?
- Yes  Did you not hear about it?

1:42:41.125 --> 1:42:44.790
It was in all the papers
I mean the death was bad enough,

1:42:44.875 --> 1:42:48.832
but then all those years    and
no-one suspecting  Not even you

1:42:48.916 --> 1:42:52.124
And you slept here,
in the same bed with him

1:42:52.208 --> 1:42:54.290
Her

1:42:55.333 --> 1:42:59.374
And    Doctor Holloran left us

1:42:59.458 --> 1:43:03.165
Took off to England
with what's-her-name    Mary

1:43:03.250 --> 1:43:06.707
Said he was tired of secrets
Can you imagine?

1:43:06.791 --> 1:43:09.582
And that good-for-nothing
Joe Mackins went off to America

1:43:09.666 --> 1:43:13.332
and left me with an unwed hussy
of a maid with a brat

1:43:13.416 --> 1:43:16.290
Now, Mr Page, I have a heart

1:43:17.208 --> 1:43:18.915
I couldn't throw her out
on the streets

1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:21.665
and call myself a Christian,
now could I?

1:43:22.500 --> 1:43:25.082
Oh, my Lordship

1:43:28.458 --> 1:43:31.832
I trust you're finding
your suite satisfactory

1:43:31.916 --> 1:43:34.999
Splendid, Mrs B  Splendid

1:43:35.083 --> 1:43:39.124
However, we seem to have misplaced
the key to the connecting door

1:43:39.208 --> 1:43:41.374
Could you have your man open it
for us?

1:43:41.458 --> 1:43:45.082
- l'll have it done right away
-Thank you

1:43:46.291 --> 1:43:48.374
I have an appetite

1:43:50.583 --> 1:43:52.707
Lovely, lovely people

1:43:54.250 --> 1:43:57.749
- So, you want the whole place
painted? - Yes, top to bottom

1:43:57.833 --> 1:44:01.999
- You'll have to hire in help,
I should think  - lt's a big job

1:44:02.083 --> 1:44:05.832
- Won't be cheap, ma'am
- Don't worry about that

1:44:05.916 --> 1:44:10.124
I came into a bit of money
Bit of good fortune

1:44:10.750 --> 1:44:13.540
But, to work, Mr Page

1:44:13.625 --> 1:44:18.540
I've put you up in Albert's
old room  For old time's sake

1:46:02.916 --> 1:46:04.999
Mr Page

1:46:05.791 --> 1:46:07.874
Hello, Helen Dawes

1:46:08.916 --> 1:46:11.582
I heard Mrs Baker say
you were coming

1:46:11.666 --> 1:46:14.540
Aye, it's a big job she wants me
to do

1:46:15.625 --> 1:46:17.707
Good

1:46:19.916 --> 1:46:21.540
May l?

1:46:41.916 --> 1:46:43.999
His name is Albert

1:46:47.291 --> 1:46:49.290
Albert Joseph

1:46:51.083 --> 1:46:53.165
So it's a "he", is it?

1:47:03.250 --> 1:47:05.540
So Mrs Baker's letting you stay,
is she?

1:47:05.625 --> 1:47:07.999
She told you that, did she?

1:47:08.750 --> 1:47:11.540
"Out of the kindness
of her Christian heart "

1:47:14.375 --> 1:47:18.082
The truth is, Mr Page

1:47:18.166 --> 1:47:22.332
the truth is she says she won't
tell the priest about my Albert

1:47:22.416 --> 1:47:26.790
as long as I work here for nothing

1:47:29.333 --> 1:47:33.040
But they are going to take him
away from me

1:47:33.916 --> 1:47:35.999
You know they will

1:47:40.458 --> 1:47:43.707
And they will throw me out
on to the street

1:47:47.125 --> 1:47:50.165
It's just a matter of time

1:47:53.625 --> 1:47:55.707
Well now

1:47:57.333 --> 1:48:00.874
we can't let that happen, can we?
