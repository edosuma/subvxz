02:49.002 --> 02:52.630
What's up, Uncle Randolph?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.773
What is it?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.609
Willy.

03:34.589 --> 03:38.802
There's three positions on a throttle.
Straight up and down is neutral.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.013
All the way back is reverse.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.265
- All the way forward...
- This way?

03:44.516 --> 03:46.267
- Forward.
- No, this way.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.520
Yeah. Very funny.

03:48.770 --> 03:53.983
Once you're in gear, get going, or
you're just gonna grind metal on metal.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.402
- You follow?
- Yeah.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.612
- You're not paying attention.
- Watch out.

03:57.862 --> 04:02.075
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.911
See you later.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.669
He's coming over to talk to us.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.254
Hey, Julie.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.047
Hi, Jesse. What's up?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.382
Me and my dad doing a little work.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.301
- Dwight.
- How you doing, Glenn?

04:20.552 --> 04:22.137
- Very good.
- Good.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.724
- Jesse's got some girlfriends, huh?
- Several hundred.

04:25.974 --> 04:31.563
- What brings you by?
- If it's okay, I'd like to talk with you.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.191
- Dwight. I didn't see you come in.
- You were busy.

04:35.442 --> 04:40.822
Man, I'm starving.
So you staying for dinner?

04:45.827 --> 04:48.288
- What?
- Come and sit with us, honey.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.374
- Why?
- Just come here.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.501
What's going on, you guys?

04:53.752 --> 04:55.420
Well...

04:55.670 --> 05:02.177
...Dwight has just told us that they
found your mom in New York City.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.928
And...

05:04.179 --> 05:09.225
...I'm afraid she's passed away.

05:10.685 --> 05:14.939
- She died?
- I'm really sorry.

05:19.361 --> 05:23.114
- I should have tried to find her.
- She didn't wanna be found.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.201
There's nothing you could have done.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.954
Your mom needs your help,
because she left somebody behind.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.457
- You have a brother.
- What?

05:32.665 --> 05:36.169
He's a half brother, actually.
He's 8 years old.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.339
Don't touch me. Just leave me alone.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.760
I don't want a brother,
I want my mom!

06:08.576 --> 06:12.372
Get out of here!

06:28.722 --> 06:34.227
How could she ditch me,
and then have another kid?

06:34.436 --> 06:38.440
I don't know, Jess.
I can't answer that one for you.

06:38.690 --> 06:42.360
I really thought if I was good...

06:42.610 --> 06:46.114
...and I believed enough...

06:46.364 --> 06:49.576
...she'd come back for me.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.203
She's not coming back, Jesse.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.832
I know.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.211
I know.

07:03.048 --> 07:07.093
It's the cold air. It gets in my eyes.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.473
Forget about that. It's okay.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.268
Your brother's gonna
live with us for a couple weeks.

07:15.477 --> 07:19.689
Dwight and Annie got it
worked out already.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.025
It's called "kinship care".

07:22.275 --> 07:23.193
Man.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.488
You're his only living relative,
so he's gonna stay with us...

07:26.738 --> 07:28.865
...till Dwight finds a place for him.

07:29.115 --> 07:34.996
Yeah, or until Annie falls in love
with him, never lets him leave.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.624
- Exactly.
- This sucks.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.920
Yeah, it kind of does, I guess.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.965
It'll be all right. You'll see.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.344
You dropped something.

07:50.762 --> 07:54.182
- Thanks.
- All right.

07:54.432 --> 07:58.228
I'll wait for you outside.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.904
- So, what about the vacation?
- What about it?

08:08.154 --> 08:12.283
You still wanna take him along?
A total stranger?

08:12.534 --> 08:16.538
We're gonna do everything we planned.
We're gonna visit Randolph.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.791
Camp out. It'll be fun.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.293
- You really believe that?
- I don't know.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.296
Ask me in a couple days.

08:25.547 --> 08:30.552
Now try and be nice to these people.
Let me give you a hand with that.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.972
Be nice. I told you to be nice.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.390
- Glenn?
- Yeah.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.683
Okay.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.144
- Hi, Dwight.
- Hey.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.938
Come in. Come in.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.526
Glenn, Annie, I'd like
for you to meet Elvis.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.487
Elvis, these are the Greenwoods.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.699
- Hi, Elvis.
- Well, aren't you guys rich?

08:52.949 --> 08:53.992
Elvis.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.328
- That's what Dwight said.
- I never said that.

08:57.579 --> 09:02.000
I told you, I can only stay
with people who are loaded.

09:02.208 --> 09:07.589
Then it's not much of an adjustment.
It's easier for me.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.801
I'll go see what's keeping
your brother.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.520
What's he look like?

09:22.729 --> 09:25.106
Different. Come find out for yourself.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.566
- I don't want to.
- Jesse.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.110
Talk to him,
you might learn a few things.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.487
Like what?

09:30.695 --> 09:36.201
Well, he spent the last eight years
with your mother. You tell me.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.580
We'll see you downstairs.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.708
Fine.

09:46.669 --> 09:50.340
He'll be right down.

09:55.637 --> 10:00.392
Elvis, this is Jesse.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.897
Hi.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.942
Whatever.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.493
Okay, we gotta hustle.
The ferry leaves at 10:30.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.955
- Elvis, do you have everything you need?
- Yes.

10:22.205 --> 10:26.084
Did you use the bathroom?
Okay. Honey, take this.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.795
Looks like everything's packed.
Let's go.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.382
- Okay, we're all set.
- Slide in and put on your seat belt.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.092
Let's go.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.177
Seat belt.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.889
Come on.

10:40.015 --> 10:44.352
Okay, we're out of here.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.898
- How did you get the name Elvis, Elvis?
- My mom.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.235
- That's funny. That's how I got mine too.
- Whatever.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.529
I'm going to be a big movie star.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.573
- Just like my dad.
- Yeah, right.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.200
My dad, you know, Al Pacino.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.578
My friends call me the Godfather.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.204
Give me a break.

11:03.455 --> 11:07.709
Hey, the ocean.
My mom loved the ocean.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.588
- She was born at sea, you know.
- Well, that's interesting.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.506
On an aircraft carrier.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.176
No one's supposed to know that.
It's classified.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.178
You come with a remote?

11:18.386 --> 11:21.890
Not that I know of.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.863
Isn't it beautiful?

11:43.787 --> 11:46.623
- What are you staring at?
- What are you staring at?

11:46.873 --> 11:50.543
- Bunch of water.
- Yeah, shows what you know.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.879
- Is there an amusement park?
- No.

11:53.129 --> 11:57.842
- There's a whale-spotting station.
- Where they paint spots on whales?

11:58.093 --> 12:00.720
Yeah.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.015
Look, whales! Whales!

12:05.225 --> 12:09.312
Wow, look at that. Wow!

12:09.562 --> 12:12.941
Oh, my God.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.820
Hey, there's the sign
for the campground.

12:17.028 --> 12:22.784
- Okay, here we go then.
- Are we there yet?

12:23.827 --> 12:27.122
Oh, boy.

12:27.205 --> 12:31.376
- I'm putting the tent up over there.
- All right.

12:32.002 --> 12:35.046
Can I get you anything?
Cup of coffee maybe?

12:35.296 --> 12:37.924
Having fun?

12:43.013 --> 12:47.517
- Elvis, come here, away from Glenn.
- Nice job.

12:48.018 --> 12:53.815
I need you to help me in here.
Would you please sweep out the tent?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.820
Jesse.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.073
Randolph.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.037
Look at you.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.957
- You must've grown six inches.
- Four and a half.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.834
- Since breakfast.
- Glenn.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.795
- Annie.
- Hi, Randolph.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.173
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.051
- This your brother?
- Half.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.095
Hi, my name's Elvis. I'm half Apache.

13:24.346 --> 13:30.393
Pleased to meet you, Elvis. Apache?
They're the sworn enemy of my people.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.980
Did I say Apache?

13:34.230 --> 13:39.027
- I meant Cherokee.
- That's even worse.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.905
- Let's go.
- Where?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.615
- Whale spotting.
- See you later.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.326
Have fun.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.913
Where do you think you're going?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.919
- You want me to drive?
- You know how?

13:56.127 --> 13:57.962
- No. Do you?
- Very funny.

13:58.213 --> 14:04.844
Here. Got a couple of surprises
for you. For you, from my village.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.098
My people believe
your soul lives here.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.936
When you wear the necklace
the orca is close to your spirit.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.482
Thanks, this is so cool.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.736
I missed you, Jesse.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.656
Me too.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.871
- Rick, Nadine.
- Hi, Randolph.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.250
- I hope she's the second surprise.
- I'll ignore that.

14:35.500 --> 14:41.589
- Aren't you gonna introduce me?
- Nope. I'll teach you how to steer.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.176
Well, who is she?

14:45.218 --> 14:51.891
She's my orca spotter. Cast off
that line, Nadine, we'll be on our way.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.367
Here.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.494
Keep a look out.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.914
Okay.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.295
Give me a break.
She's my goddaughter.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.755
What are you saying?

15:22.005 --> 15:25.050
She's like a daughter to me.
I look out for her.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.969
Okay.

15:28.178 --> 15:32.223
Nadine, come on up here.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.983
What did you need, Randolph?

15:42.233 --> 15:44.444
Nadine, Jesse. Jesse, Nadine.

15:44.653 --> 15:47.906
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.033
- Nice to meet you.
- Nadine, take over.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.911
Jesse, come with me.
I want you to listen to something.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.663
- I gotta get by.
- Yeah.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.791
Okay.

15:59.501 --> 16:05.590
Listen to this. I made this
recording about a week ago.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.932
Randolph, it's Willy.

16:14.140 --> 16:18.645
I didn't want to tell you
till we knew for sure.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.824
No orcas.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.660
- I'll take over, Nadine.
- Okay.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.788
Maybe they're out at
Turner's Point having lunch.

16:37.038 --> 16:41.751
Okay. Going down
to get a better look.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.318
Hey, guys. J Pod.

17:07.569 --> 17:11.156
Wow, we gotta get closer!

17:12.574 --> 17:16.118
I count 16, maybe 17.

17:21.833 --> 17:26.046
Right there! Do you see it, Randolph?

17:34.637 --> 17:36.640
Look at the size of that one.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.225
That's Catspaw, Willy's mother.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.270
Willy's mom.

17:45.023 --> 17:48.068
He found her.

17:48.318 --> 17:51.738
Over there. They're spy-hopping.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.586
That one's got a white patch
on his dorsal.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.506
- Her dorsal.
- Her dorsal?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.758
That's Luna, Willy's sister.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.677
The calf is Littlespot,
Willy's brother.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.014
Yeah, I see him.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.980
- That's Willy!
- I know.

18:28.900 --> 18:32.028
Willy!

18:32.529 --> 18:34.489
Wow, he looks great.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.116
Willy!

18:36.366 --> 18:38.410
They're hunting now.
We'll come back tomorrow.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.787
- What time?
- Very early.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.915
Yes.

18:59.931 --> 19:04.936
Glenn, I saw Willy! I saw him just
for a second, really far away.

19:05.186 --> 19:08.606
- Randolph thought you might.
- It was so cool, you know...

19:08.857 --> 19:11.484
...to see him with his family.

19:11.735 --> 19:16.489
- Must be great for him.
- Yeah. Must be.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.121
Do you think he misses me?

19:23.371 --> 19:27.417
Yeah. I know he does.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.464
Besides, you got your own family.

19:32.714 --> 19:36.176
Just like Willy.
Don't forget. All right?

19:36.426 --> 19:38.053
Yeah.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.431
I know.

19:47.270 --> 19:51.524
Jesse, honey, move that twig
or it will hurt your back.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.485
I can't sleep on the ground.

19:53.735 --> 19:58.823
We're all sleeping on the ground.
It's called camping.

19:59.824 --> 20:04.454
- You have two pads, and I only have one.
- Nobody knew you were coming.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.831
- But I have a bad back.
- So what.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.168
Come on. You had a great day.
Give Elvis your extra pad.

20:10.418 --> 20:14.464
After all, he is our guest.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.801
- Thanks, Jesse.
- Yeah, Elvis.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.012
You help him set up, okay?
Good night, guys.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.099
I'm gonna close this so you
won't get bitten by mosquitoes.

20:24.349 --> 20:28.520
- You don't have a bad back, do you?
- I do so. I have spasms...

20:28.728 --> 20:31.356
...which I got bungee jumping
in the Alps.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.193
Yeah, right. See this line?

20:35.443 --> 20:40.115
- No.
- Well, you cross it, you're dead.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.702
- They told me all about you and Willy.
- Go to sleep.

20:43.952 --> 20:47.497
It's funny. The same thing
happened to me two summers ago.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.708
Shut up!

20:49.958 --> 20:52.836
Go to sleep!

20:55.797 --> 21:00.260
Is this the line you didn't want me
to cross? Or is this the line?

21:00.510 --> 21:04.097
All right, that's it!

21:36.129 --> 21:37.672
Great.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.550
Just great!

21:50.018 --> 21:51.227
Willy.

21:51.478 --> 21:56.566
Hey, boy.
You've grown, haven't you? Yeah.

21:56.775 --> 22:00.945
Guess you've been
eating pretty well, huh?

22:01.529 --> 22:05.116
Wow! Thanks, boy, you found it.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.369
Thanks.

22:09.245 --> 22:13.333
I missed you so much.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.838
I saw you with your family.
You must be happy...

22:19.089 --> 22:22.717
...to be with your mom.

22:28.139 --> 22:31.393
My mom died.

22:35.897 --> 22:40.068
I miss her so much.

22:40.985 --> 22:47.283
I feel like I've got nobody.
I feel like I'm all alone.

22:49.577 --> 22:53.498
I don't know what to do.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.011
That's your mom.

23:07.220 --> 23:11.057
You better go, she's calling.

23:20.608 --> 23:24.404
Good night, Willy.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.553
Caught you!

23:48.803 --> 23:51.222
I never sleep.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.768
Good night.

23:59.064 --> 24:01.066
- Glenn, Annie!
- Oh, God.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.651
Let's go out
on the boat with Randolph.

24:03.902 --> 24:07.113
Keep your voice down.
You're gonna wake a grizzly bear.

24:07.364 --> 24:12.494
- Don't you usually wake up after noon?
- Randolph leaves at dawn. Let's go.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.038
You go on ahead. Okay?

24:15.288 --> 24:17.916
Jesse, take Elvis with you.

24:18.166 --> 24:21.670
No way.

24:23.838 --> 24:27.550
Wake up!

24:28.551 --> 24:31.429
- Hurry up.
- I'm walking as fast as I can.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.391
- Try running.
- My legs are shorter than yours.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.851
If Randolph leaves,
I'm gonna kill you.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.312
Well, I have a black belt in karate.

24:39.562 --> 24:42.649
Well, I have laser death-rays
that come out of my eyes.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.944
Liar.

24:45.944 --> 24:50.740
- Come on, hurry up, let's go!
- Okay.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.535
Randolph, I'll see you
in a couple hours.

24:53.785 --> 24:57.622
Yeah, okay. Sure.

24:59.874 --> 25:03.920
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.633
Traitor.

25:08.842 --> 25:10.844
- What?
- Girls are the enemy.

25:11.094 --> 25:14.597
No, you are the enemy.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.684
When are we leaving?

25:17.934 --> 25:20.979
I got a problem.
It'll take me a couple of hours.

25:21.229 --> 25:24.441
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.735
Yeah.

25:26.985 --> 25:30.405
See you in a couple hours.

25:30.655 --> 25:35.827
- Come on, let's go, hurry up!
- Hey, wait up!

25:35.827 --> 25:38.913
Elvis, just go back to camp.
Tell Glenn and Annie...

25:39.122 --> 25:42.876
...I went with Randolph but you
couldn't go because you get seasick.

25:43.084 --> 25:47.630
- But that'll be a lie.
- I'm really sure you can handle it.

25:47.839 --> 25:52.969
- What are you gonna do?
- None of your business.

26:46.815 --> 26:49.984
Gosh.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.701
Look at that.

27:04.249 --> 27:07.419
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sitting in the ocean.

27:07.669 --> 27:11.756
- You followed me here, didn't you?
- So?

27:15.051 --> 27:19.472
- Yeah.
- Here, I'll help you up.

27:19.556 --> 27:23.977
- What is this place?
- My favorite place in the world.

27:39.159 --> 27:41.870
- Yeah, that's J Pod.
- Yeah, I know that.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.830
This is their rubbing rocks.

27:44.080 --> 27:48.251
Orcas come to rub themselves
on the rocks at the bottom of the cove.

27:48.501 --> 27:51.546
If you sit here long enough,
one will come close.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.631
How close?

27:53.882 --> 27:57.343
Ten feet once.

28:14.152 --> 28:20.241
- Are you still trying to impress me?
- Just watch. Just watch.

28:35.298 --> 28:39.219
Come on, I gotta show
you something. Come on!

28:39.469 --> 28:41.888
Come on, let's go!

28:42.097 --> 28:43.932
Hurry up. Let's go, come on!

28:44.140 --> 28:48.353
- Where we going?
- Follow me. I know where I'm going.

28:48.603 --> 28:52.315
Come on. Let's go, come on.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.362
- Let me help you.
- I'm okay.

28:57.612 --> 28:58.530
- All right.
- Thanks.

28:58.738 --> 29:02.867
Hurry, though. I gotta show you this.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.998
Careful on that log.

29:12.210 --> 29:13.628
Say, girl...

29:13.878 --> 29:16.715
...where's your brother, huh?

29:16.965 --> 29:19.384
Come on, boy.

29:19.634 --> 29:22.512
Come on.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.723
Just one second. Come on, boy.

29:25.974 --> 29:30.270
Come on, boy. Come on.

29:30.437 --> 29:34.232
- Willy, where'd you come from?
- Oh, my gosh.

29:35.150 --> 29:40.113
Hey, boy. You scared me.

29:40.905 --> 29:44.284
How you doing, huh?

29:45.410 --> 29:49.706
It's okay. Yeah, open up.

29:49.956 --> 29:53.043
See? He's friendly.

29:54.127 --> 29:57.297
Good boy.

29:57.505 --> 30:00.216
Wow, who's this?

30:00.425 --> 30:02.260
Is this your brother?

30:02.469 --> 30:05.764
Littlespot?

30:06.181 --> 30:08.391
I want you to meet somebody, okay?

30:08.641 --> 30:12.062
You gotta help me. All right?

30:12.270 --> 30:16.274
Come on. It's okay.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.112
Really, it's okay.
Nadine, this is Willy.

30:21.363 --> 30:23.573
Willy, Nadine.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.785
Hi. Oh, my gosh.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.828
- He's pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

30:29.079 --> 30:31.790
- You can touch him.
- No, that's okay. I don't...

30:32.040 --> 30:33.708
No, go ahead.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.877
Come on.

30:36.127 --> 30:37.587
Okay.

30:37.796 --> 30:41.966
- Just reach out and touch him.
- Hi, Willy.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.928
Come on.

30:45.053 --> 30:47.472
Hi, Willy. Hi.

30:47.722 --> 30:50.809
He's going under.

30:52.310 --> 30:55.271
- Come on, Willy. What are you doing?
- He spit on me.

30:55.522 --> 30:56.940
I'm sorry.

30:57.190 --> 31:00.318
- Here's Littlespot.
- Littlespot, what are you doing?

31:00.568 --> 31:03.154
Hey.

31:03.321 --> 31:08.243
- Oh, my gosh. Wow, this is great.
- I'm gonna get you, Willy.

31:08.493 --> 31:11.538
- He's coming back.
- Sorry.

31:12.205 --> 31:13.915
- He's showing off.
- What's he doing?

31:14.165 --> 31:16.835
Showing off. Hey, whoa!

31:17.085 --> 31:21.673
- He did it again.
- What's your problem? Great friend.

31:21.923 --> 31:25.427
I gotta get it.

31:29.180 --> 31:33.268
- Come on in. The water's great.
- Get a grip. This is a killer whale.

31:33.476 --> 31:36.604
Come on, he's my friend.

31:37.021 --> 31:41.443
- Jesse!
- Yeah, Willy.

31:41.609 --> 31:45.113
Way to go, boy!

31:45.322 --> 31:48.241
Oh, my gosh.

31:51.119 --> 31:54.748
Oh, my gosh.

31:59.669 --> 32:03.590
Nadine, come on in, it's great!

32:03.798 --> 32:07.844
Let's go!

32:14.851 --> 32:17.187
Hey, Luna!

32:17.437 --> 32:19.147
All right!

32:19.397 --> 32:23.068
Hey, look, no hands.

32:44.339 --> 32:47.258
All right, Willy.

32:58.436 --> 33:01.523
Get away from me!

33:01.731 --> 33:03.441
Later, Willy.

33:03.650 --> 33:06.444
Jesse.

33:07.445 --> 33:11.074
Give me your hand.

33:11.408 --> 33:13.076
- Here.
- Thanks.

33:13.326 --> 33:17.455
I can't believe that. That was so cool.

33:17.706 --> 33:21.668
- Maybe you can touch him next time.
- I can't believe he let you do that.

33:21.918 --> 33:26.005
- I think he likes it.
- I think you're right.

33:26.214 --> 33:30.010
- Bye, boy. See you.
- Bye.

33:51.781 --> 33:55.577
{Y:i}Oil tanker "Dakar",
this is vessel traffic control. Over.

33:55.827 --> 34:01.583
Vessel traffic control, this is the
tanker "Dakar" at 124.40 inbound.

34:06.630 --> 34:09.882
{Y:i}- Prepare to load oil at 1500 hours.
- Copy, Dakar.

34:10.132 --> 34:13.219
We're cleared.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.699
- What?
- He doesn't look anything like you.

34:35.949 --> 34:39.663
Elvis. Yeah, well,
we got different dads.

34:39.913 --> 34:43.458
Hey, look, an oil tanker.

34:45.418 --> 34:50.047
Tell me about it. They come through
like it's their own private highway.

34:50.297 --> 34:54.135
I saw Jesse kissing Nadine.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.227
Any sign of J Pod?

35:02.477 --> 35:04.729
Maybe they went back
to the rubbing rocks.

35:04.979 --> 35:08.233
- You wanna go down and check it out?
- Okay.

35:08.483 --> 35:11.569
Cool.

35:14.906 --> 35:18.034
- Hey, Glenn.
- Hey.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.078
Nadine, this is Glenn.

35:20.328 --> 35:23.248
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.625
Randolph's goddaughter.

35:25.875 --> 35:28.712
- Can I talk to you a second?
- Sure.

35:28.962 --> 35:30.839
I'll be right back.

35:31.089 --> 35:32.382
Okay.

35:32.590 --> 35:35.385
Elvis saw you and Nadine
down at the cove.

35:35.635 --> 35:37.470
Yeah, that figures.

35:37.720 --> 35:42.559
I was a lot like you when I was your age.
But Annie wants me to talk to you.

35:42.809 --> 35:45.395
She thinks that kind of behavior
can be dangerous.

35:45.645 --> 35:47.939
Nadine thought so too,
but it's safe.

35:48.148 --> 35:51.776
- I know exactly what I'm doing.
- I used to think the same thing.

35:51.985 --> 35:54.863
- Huh?
- Yeah.

35:55.071 --> 35:57.574
Well, I'm practically an expert.

35:57.824 --> 36:00.702
Yeah, well, listen...

36:00.910 --> 36:03.163
You're a smart kid. You're a good kid.

36:03.413 --> 36:07.834
You're just going with your feelings,
but it can lead to other things.

36:08.084 --> 36:10.754
Like what?

36:11.504 --> 36:14.549
- Well, sex.
- Can lead to sex?

36:14.799 --> 36:18.094
Yeah, right. Can lead to sex.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.431
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Why?

36:21.681 --> 36:24.017
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:24.267 --> 36:27.604
- I'm talking about you kissing Nadine.
- I didn't kiss her.

36:27.854 --> 36:31.566
- You didn't?
- No, I didn't kiss her. Who said that?

36:31.816 --> 36:35.070
I'll give you three guesses.

36:40.909 --> 36:42.327
Hi.

36:42.577 --> 36:43.995
Whatever.

36:44.245 --> 36:47.999
- You're not going anywhere.
- But I'm hungry.

36:48.541 --> 36:51.544
Eat your hat.

38:57.295 --> 39:02.634
That did a lot. All right, come on.
I know you're in there.

39:04.302 --> 39:08.139
All right, come on.
Ain't so tough now, huh?

39:08.390 --> 39:10.266
Man.

39:10.517 --> 39:11.810
Eat this.

39:12.060 --> 39:14.771
How do you like that, tough guy?

39:15.021 --> 39:18.858
Come back and fight like a fish.

39:19.067 --> 39:22.445
See you later, fish.

39:49.889 --> 39:53.184
See you, Willy.

40:04.154 --> 40:05.071
What is it?

40:05.322 --> 40:07.282
- We lost time up north. We're late.
- So?

40:07.532 --> 40:10.493
- Know why I'm captain?
- Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.

40:10.744 --> 40:13.872
I'm captain because
my ships always run on time.

40:14.122 --> 40:16.750
Benbrook Oil doesn't like
late deliveries.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.043
{Y:i}- Yes, sir.
- This is Seattle Traffic.

40:19.294 --> 40:22.339
{Y:i}We have a report of winds
and reduced visibility.

40:22.589 --> 40:24.382
Reduce speed to 12 knots.

40:24.633 --> 40:28.094
- Reducing speed to 12 knots.
- Maintain 15 knots.

40:28.344 --> 40:33.266
- But, sir, without a tug escort...
- Kelly!

40:33.975 --> 40:38.104
Resuming speed to 15 knots.

40:43.234 --> 40:47.530
- Elvis. Elvis, wake up.
- What?

40:47.739 --> 40:49.949
I have to ask you something.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.117
Okay.

40:51.367 --> 40:58.083
Did Mom ever talk about before you
were born, when she lived out here?

40:58.333 --> 41:00.585
No.

41:00.835 --> 41:04.881
Did she ever talk about my dad?

41:05.131 --> 41:06.800
No.

41:07.050 --> 41:09.177
Did she ever talk about me?

41:09.385 --> 41:12.389
No.

41:19.687 --> 41:22.941
- She had problems.
- Like what?

41:23.191 --> 41:26.611
She lied a lot.

41:26.736 --> 41:29.948
Said she loved me.

41:30.657 --> 41:34.911
Said she would never leave.

42:03.773 --> 42:05.775
- What is it?
- We're losing pressure.

42:06.026 --> 42:07.819
We can't hold course in these currents.

42:08.028 --> 42:10.488
- What happened?
- The valve body blew to pieces.

42:10.739 --> 42:14.033
- Engine room.
- Give me something down there.

42:14.284 --> 42:16.619
{Y:i}- I got nothing.
- We're doing the best we can.

42:16.828 --> 42:19.789
Keep working on it.

42:27.630 --> 42:32.052
We're on the wrong side of the buoy.
Hard starboard!

42:32.302 --> 42:35.096
Not responding!

42:37.098 --> 42:38.933
- Hard starboard!
- I can't bring it around.

42:39.184 --> 42:41.645
Four fathoms!

42:44.397 --> 42:47.067
- Two fathoms.
- My God.

42:47.275 --> 42:50.445
We've run aground!

42:50.946 --> 42:53.948
I'm gonna shut it down!

43:10.590 --> 43:12.842
{Y:i}Mayday, mayday. This is tanker "Dakar".

43:13.093 --> 43:15.929
{Y:i}We are run aground
and spilling crude oil.

43:16.179 --> 43:22.185
{Y:i}Extreme distress.
Repeat, extreme distress.

43:57.846 --> 43:58.888
Man.

43:59.139 --> 44:03.268
Come on. Hurry up.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.065
He's over there. Look!

44:09.315 --> 44:12.360
Come on, come on!

44:18.116 --> 44:20.869
Let's go!

44:22.620 --> 44:26.833
It's Willy's sister, Luna.
She's beached.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.879
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

44:33.381 --> 44:37.093
It's okay. You're all right.

44:46.603 --> 44:49.022
- What is that stuff?
- Oil.

44:49.272 --> 44:53.568
Get Glenn. Have him call Randolph.
We gotta get Luna back in the water.

44:53.818 --> 44:58.156
- Go! Hurry! Go!
- Okay.

44:59.157 --> 45:03.411
You're gonna be okay. I promise.

45:04.329 --> 45:08.708
Wake up! Wake up.
Come on, wake up. Guys, come on.

45:08.958 --> 45:14.089
There's been an oil spill. Trapped
the whales. Willy's sister is beached.

45:14.339 --> 45:18.051
You gotta do something.
Call the Army or something.

45:18.301 --> 45:20.762
Call Randolph.
I think maybe a ship crashed.

45:20.970 --> 45:22.931
- It's a major disaster.
- Go back to sleep.

45:23.181 --> 45:27.686
- I'm telling the truth.
- That's a first.

45:27.852 --> 45:30.563
Glenn, listen.

45:30.772 --> 45:33.608
I'll call Randolph.

45:37.821 --> 45:38.738
Hang on.

45:38.989 --> 45:42.575
{Y:i}A major oil spill at Lawson Reef.

45:44.452 --> 45:48.957
- Thanks for coming, Randolph.
- Looks serious.

45:49.165 --> 45:53.169
Luna's sick. I think she's dying.

45:53.503 --> 45:54.462
See. I told you.

45:54.713 --> 45:59.634
Nadine, go back to the truck
and get my kit please.

46:00.093 --> 46:02.178
Easy, girl. Easy.

46:02.429 --> 46:04.514
Honey, the oil's all over her.

46:04.764 --> 46:06.891
Here you go, Randolph.

46:07.100 --> 46:09.603
It's okay.

46:11.521 --> 46:13.106
Okay.

46:13.356 --> 46:16.651
- Let me get this.
- It's okay.

46:16.860 --> 46:19.738
I'm afraid the oil's
gotten into her lungs.

46:19.988 --> 46:25.910
Okay. Run this down to the lab, tell them
it's from me, and it's an emergency.

46:26.161 --> 46:27.579
Okay, let's go.

46:27.829 --> 46:29.581
Easy now. Easy.

46:29.831 --> 46:31.791
- On the head?
- Wherever you can.

46:32.041 --> 46:34.961
On three, guys, okay?
One, two, three!

46:35.211 --> 46:37.130
Push!

46:37.339 --> 46:39.841
Come on, Luna.

46:42.510 --> 46:46.473
Okay, again, on three.
One, two, three!

46:46.723 --> 46:47.974
- Come on, girl.
- Push.

46:48.183 --> 46:51.144
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

46:51.394 --> 46:53.521
There she goes. She's going.

46:53.772 --> 46:56.316
Go, girl. Go, girl.

46:56.566 --> 47:02.155
- Let's get back up and change.
- The whale, the whale. Is she okay?

47:02.197 --> 47:06.576
- She needs help, Randolph.
- Yeah.

47:17.462 --> 47:21.508
- I don't care. I gotta get the story.
- Excuse me. Out of the way.

47:21.758 --> 47:24.344
Excuse me.

47:26.721 --> 47:29.599
The "Dakar", a 40-year-old
Liberian oil tanker...

47:29.849 --> 47:33.353
...ran aground on Lawson Reef
at 12:05 last night...

47:33.603 --> 47:36.189
...spilling thousands of gallons
of raw crude...

47:36.439 --> 47:40.443
...endangering these orcas and other
wildlife indigenous to this region.

47:40.694 --> 47:42.862
{Y:i}- The single-hull tanker...
- I'll take care of it.

47:43.071 --> 47:46.908
{Y:i}... was built well before 1990,
the year when double hulls...

47:47.158 --> 47:52.664
{Y:i}... became mandatory, which many feel
could prevent disasters like this one.

47:52.872 --> 47:58.211
- Save the ecology.
- Don't kill the whales.

48:08.638 --> 48:11.766
She's here. Let's go.

48:16.104 --> 48:18.440
- Here we go.
- Let's secure that stuff.

48:18.690 --> 48:21.401
- I'm Dr. Haley.
- Cmdr. Blake, Coastal Marine Control.

48:21.651 --> 48:25.155
- Medical team's already here.
- This is what we've got.

48:25.405 --> 48:28.408
- Kate!
- Here, take this.

48:28.658 --> 48:29.701
Randolph.

48:29.909 --> 48:33.788
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too. Me too.

48:34.039 --> 48:36.583
- When was this sample taken?
- Three hours ago.

48:36.791 --> 48:39.294
Four aspirations a minute.
Breathing's labored.

48:39.544 --> 48:42.005
Let's do this now. Prep the antibiotics.

48:42.255 --> 48:44.758
- Keflin?
- Twenty cc.

48:45.008 --> 48:46.301
Jesse found them.

48:46.551 --> 48:49.387
Jesse. Randolph's told me
all about you.

48:49.596 --> 48:52.265
Boat's ready, Kate.

48:52.474 --> 48:55.477
- Willy doesn't like doctors.
- She's one of the good ones.

48:55.727 --> 48:58.980
But he doesn't know that.

49:05.028 --> 49:08.198
Jesse, the oil slick
is moving this way.

49:08.448 --> 49:13.119
If the whales don't get better fast,
they'll be trapped.

49:15.455 --> 49:17.999
Pull up right alongside her, okay?

49:18.250 --> 49:21.336
We'll make this quick and painless.

49:30.345 --> 49:31.930
They seem to be protecting her.

49:32.180 --> 49:34.974
That's not like him.

49:39.395 --> 49:42.524
Stop. Stop. Stop!

49:58.039 --> 49:59.541
I'm not gonna lie, Jesse.

49:59.791 --> 50:02.544
This is awful,
and my company's to blame.

50:02.794 --> 50:05.714
It's important to me that no harm
come to these whales.

50:05.922 --> 50:08.091
And that is where you come in.

50:08.341 --> 50:10.969
I could help too.
Littlespot likes me.

50:11.219 --> 50:14.180
- I could...
- Elvis, please.

50:14.431 --> 50:16.891
- Willy trusts you.
- He doesn't trust you.

50:17.142 --> 50:19.686
- Jesse.
- He thinks he's protecting Luna.

50:19.936 --> 50:22.647
But by keeping us from her,
he's killing her.

50:22.897 --> 50:27.193
You're his only friend, Jesse.

50:29.487 --> 50:32.031
- I'll make a deal with you.
- I'm listening.

50:32.282 --> 50:35.201
- I'll convince Willy to let us help Luna.
- Great.

50:35.452 --> 50:40.040
But you have to promise to get Willy,
Luna and Littlespot back to their mom.

50:40.248 --> 50:42.834
- I can't promise that.
- Your oil's killing Luna.

50:43.042 --> 50:47.464
If she dies, everybody's gonna
see it on the news. They'll blame you.

50:47.714 --> 50:53.178
- What do you want me to say?
- Just promise me you'll try.

50:53.428 --> 50:56.389
Well, that I can do.

51:09.486 --> 51:10.779
Mind if I join you?

51:11.029 --> 51:16.242
Do whatever you want.
I'm only your guest, remember?

51:23.708 --> 51:28.421
- Wanna tell me what's bothering you?
- Nothing.

51:30.090 --> 51:32.425
You and Jesse seem to be getting along.

51:32.676 --> 51:35.804
- I hate him.
- Now I know that's not true.

51:36.012 --> 51:39.307
The whole world kisses Jesse's butt.
I'm tired of it.

51:39.557 --> 51:42.769
Let me tell you, this family
doesn't play favorites.

51:42.978 --> 51:46.272
We don't kiss butts.

51:49.651 --> 51:53.530
- I wanna help.
- Well, the whales need your help.

51:53.780 --> 51:57.325
- You promise I can help?
- I promise.

51:57.534 --> 52:00.578
Well, will you spit-shake on it?

52:00.829 --> 52:03.582
Okay.

52:15.093 --> 52:19.097
This is very unhygienic.

52:26.855 --> 52:29.441
- Jesse?
- Yeah?

52:29.691 --> 52:32.402
Good luck.

52:32.736 --> 52:35.447
Thanks.

52:41.161 --> 52:44.623
- Be careful, Jess.
- You take care, Jesse.

52:44.873 --> 52:47.876
He looks mad, Randolph.

53:22.285 --> 53:24.871
That's a boy. Come on.
It's me, Jesse.

53:25.121 --> 53:26.456
Come on. It's okay.

53:26.665 --> 53:30.376
Come on. It's okay.

53:32.462 --> 53:35.674
Willy, I wanna help.

53:38.343 --> 53:41.137
What's the matter? Come on.

53:41.346 --> 53:44.933
- Come on, stop.
- God. He's gonna eat him, isn't he?

53:45.183 --> 53:48.186
Come on. You're gonna hurt yourself.
Please, stop.

53:48.436 --> 53:54.109
Come on, Willy. Come on.
It's all right. It's all right.

53:55.777 --> 53:58.280
It's okay.

53:59.989 --> 54:03.159
That's it. That's it.

54:03.326 --> 54:07.539
How about some chocolate, Willy?

54:09.499 --> 54:11.501
I got something for you.

54:11.709 --> 54:13.420
Please.

54:13.628 --> 54:16.214
Just take the fish.

54:17.299 --> 54:19.301
All right.

54:19.509 --> 54:22.429
Open up wider.

54:22.429 --> 54:25.265
There you go.

54:26.307 --> 54:28.476
Good boy.

54:28.727 --> 54:31.229
All right, go.

54:32.105 --> 54:34.566
Go around him.

54:37.861 --> 54:41.823
- Hello, Luna, sweetie.
- She won't hurt her. I promise.

54:42.031 --> 54:44.284
That's it, boy. It's okay.

54:44.534 --> 54:48.788
Everything's gonna be okay, Luna.

54:55.211 --> 54:57.464
I need to get her to raise her fluke.

54:57.672 --> 55:02.343
All right. Let's go.
Come on, raise your fluke.

55:06.681 --> 55:10.518
That's it. All right, Willy.

55:12.062 --> 55:16.566
That's it, Luna. That's it.
One more time.

55:17.817 --> 55:20.320
Good girl.

55:20.570 --> 55:23.281
Okay.

55:24.157 --> 55:26.284
- We did it.
- All right.

55:26.534 --> 55:29.537
I told you.

55:32.165 --> 55:35.126
Thank you, Willy.

55:38.171 --> 55:43.176
- Congratulations, Dr. Haley.
- That was great.

55:44.969 --> 55:46.596
You hit it out of the park.

55:46.805 --> 55:49.391
- John?
- Just a minute.

55:49.599 --> 55:52.060
You're gonna wanna hear this.

55:52.310 --> 55:54.437
{Y:i}- Who is this?
- Pete Wilcox here.

55:54.646 --> 55:58.817
{Y:i}Understand you got some problems.
Listen up.

56:00.318 --> 56:01.945
Hey, what's the matter?

56:02.195 --> 56:05.115
The oil slick is being pushed
by the wind toward the cove.

56:05.323 --> 56:09.077
We don't have a lot of time, guys.

56:25.302 --> 56:26.845
It's gonna be okay.

56:27.095 --> 56:31.099
I know it. It's all gonna get better.

56:31.391 --> 56:36.062
No matter what, Jesse,
it's not all gonna be okay.

56:36.312 --> 56:41.484
I mean, birds, otters,
seals, this whole cove...

56:41.693 --> 56:44.946
It's all ruined.

56:57.750 --> 57:03.048
- What...?
- It's the best I could do.

57:09.721 --> 57:14.559
- What, you want your pocket back?
- It's okay.

57:26.321 --> 57:32.035
- Who said you could touch that?
- The president. He announced it on TV.

57:34.579 --> 57:37.415
Here.

57:38.166 --> 57:41.961
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah. What's it mean?

57:42.170 --> 57:46.049
There was a young Haida Indian
named Natselane.

57:46.257 --> 57:49.093
He lived many years
before there were whales.

57:49.344 --> 57:53.223
One day he got lost,
and he couldn't find his way home.

57:53.473 --> 57:56.643
He carved the first whale ever
out of a log.

57:56.851 --> 58:00.647
He got on the back of the whale
and rode it all the way home.

58:00.855 --> 58:04.150
- He rode him all the way home?
- Yeah.

58:04.401 --> 58:10.323
- Wow. That's a cool story, Jesse.
- Randolph told it to me.

58:11.825 --> 58:13.868
Glenn, Annie!

58:14.119 --> 58:15.120
We got a problem!

58:15.370 --> 58:19.541
Luna's beached herself again.
It's serious.

58:20.416 --> 58:22.710
Call the Department of Fish and Wildlife.

58:22.961 --> 58:27.090
- Go. Go!
- Yes, sir.

58:30.385 --> 58:32.679
- Jesse, you're coming with me.
- Where?

58:32.929 --> 58:39.144
We have to try something. I'll explain
on the way. Nadine, stay with Luna.

58:39.436 --> 58:41.813
- Elvis, you stay here.
- I'm coming too.

58:42.021 --> 58:44.941
No, this is between me and Randolph.
You stay.

58:45.191 --> 58:47.986
Help Glenn.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.782
Damn!

58:53.032 --> 58:54.909
Easy now, girl.

58:55.160 --> 58:59.414
Okay, let's just try and keep her wet.

59:00.624 --> 59:02.250
Glenn, can I help?

59:02.459 --> 59:04.461
Elvis, stand back.

59:04.711 --> 59:07.464
- I thought I could help.
- Not now. Get back!

59:07.714 --> 59:08.715
I wanna help!

59:08.965 --> 59:09.883
- Elvis!
- What?

59:10.133 --> 59:15.096
It's dangerous. I want you
to stay on that beach. Go!

59:16.056 --> 59:17.223
Go. Right now.

59:17.474 --> 59:20.018
- Okay. Should we try to push her?
- On three.

59:20.226 --> 59:22.437
One, two, three.

59:22.687 --> 59:25.273
There are medicines besides the ones
Dr. Haley believes in.

59:25.523 --> 59:27.984
They all come from
our mother, the earth.

59:28.234 --> 59:31.947
Calling upon our ancestors
to heal sickness is a gift...

59:32.197 --> 59:34.324
...handed down through generations.

59:34.574 --> 59:38.078
My grandmother taught me.
Now I teach you.

59:38.328 --> 59:43.958
Knowing this is part of what it means
to have medicine roots.

59:46.336 --> 59:50.548
The root we're looking for
has leaves on the bottom.

01:00:05.438 --> 01:00:06.689
Where's Elvis?

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.485
I don't know. I told him to stay up
on the beach.

01:00:10.735 --> 01:00:12.946
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:00:13.154 --> 01:00:15.907
- I broke a promise.
- What promise?

01:00:16.157 --> 01:00:22.080
- I even did a spit-shake on it.
- You did a spit-shake with somebody?

01:00:22.539 --> 01:00:26.543
- Excuse me.
- Man, that's serious.

01:00:36.636 --> 01:00:38.805
- What's that?
- It's called Skookum.

01:00:39.055 --> 01:00:41.808
- It's very strong.
- How strong?

01:00:42.058 --> 01:00:45.145
Give me your hand.

01:00:51.026 --> 01:00:54.779
I can taste it in my mouth.

01:00:57.365 --> 01:01:00.118
Elvis?

01:01:04.331 --> 01:01:07.041
Elvis!

01:01:18.386 --> 01:01:21.598
Thanks, mister.

01:01:29.606 --> 01:01:33.693
Come on. Let me in.
Come on, man.

01:01:33.943 --> 01:01:37.322
Man. Damn!

01:01:37.572 --> 01:01:42.243
- When does the next ferry leave?
- Tomorrow morning.

01:01:47.249 --> 01:01:52.212
Officer! Have you seen...?

01:02:02.847 --> 01:02:05.225
Elvis!

01:02:05.475 --> 01:02:08.520
Elvis!

01:02:19.864 --> 01:02:21.699
Hey, Luna.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:25.787
Seen your brother?
Come on, Willy.

01:02:26.037 --> 01:02:29.916
Hey, there you are. Come here.

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:33.211
Come here, boy.

01:02:34.129 --> 01:02:38.842
That's it. That's it, boy. Yeah.

01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:41.761
Good boy.

01:02:42.178 --> 01:02:45.724
Come on. Open up.

01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:49.019
That's it, boy.

01:03:02.532 --> 01:03:05.285
Good girl.

01:03:06.786 --> 01:03:12.459
- Yeah. There we go.
- Good girl.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.848
We've done everything in our power.
All we can do now is let her sleep.

01:04:09.057 --> 01:04:11.893
Wait and see if the spirits
are with us tonight?

01:04:12.102 --> 01:04:18.066
The spirits are always with us.
I'll see you in a while.

01:04:20.151 --> 01:04:24.197
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:28.785
Thanks.

01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:12.329
Yes.

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:21.713
- Looks like Luna's doing better.
- Yeah. Pretty powerful, my medicine.

01:05:21.963 --> 01:05:25.884
- Your medicine?
- Did I say that? I meant your medicine.

01:05:26.134 --> 01:05:28.511
What have you been doing
behind my back?

01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:30.930
Nothing.

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:37.270
Well, whatever you did,
I'm glad you did it.

01:05:44.611 --> 01:05:47.072
I'll have a jelly-filled and a coffee.

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:48.740
Coffee?

01:05:48.948 --> 01:05:53.578
- Yeah, black.
- Black coffee.

01:05:56.122 --> 01:06:00.001
- Coffee or anything?
- No, I'm fine.

01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:03.588
We haven't taken an orca
out of the wild in 20 years.

01:06:03.838 --> 01:06:06.591
Now there's three, right in my hands.

01:06:06.841 --> 01:06:10.345
A million dollars for the young ones.
Two for the older brother.

01:06:10.553 --> 01:06:14.349
Young males are particularly attractive
due to their breeding capabilities.

01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:18.061
The older brother's already trained.
He's a gold mine.

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:21.981
- You've gotta be very careful.
- Don't worry. You're covered.

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:24.442
Long-term rehabilitation
is what I recommend.

01:06:24.693 --> 01:06:28.989
So long as it looks like we have
the whales' best interest at heart.

01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:30.657
That's all that matters to me.

01:06:30.907 --> 01:06:35.912
Sure, and your 10%. Besides, we
do have their best interest at heart.

01:06:36.162 --> 01:06:39.082
They'll be well cared for.
In the meantime...

01:06:39.332 --> 01:06:41.126
...while they're getting healthy...

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:46.631
...no reason why people shouldn't
pay to see them. Right?

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.479
Man.

01:07:01.729 --> 01:07:04.566
{Y:i}The situation at Lawson Reef
is worsening.

01:07:04.816 --> 01:07:08.069
{Y:i}Crews are fighting the spreading oil
around the clock...

01:07:08.278 --> 01:07:11.573
{Y:i}... but they are no match for the
heavy winds and strong currents.

01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:15.035
{Y:i}Benbrook Oil now reports that
oil and gas fumes...

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:20.624
{Y:i}... are growing more dangerous, and
workers are proceeding with caution.

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:23.543
{Y:i}Sensitive coves and beaches
are being boomed off...

01:07:23.793 --> 01:07:25.837
{Y:i}... to protect endangered wildlife.

01:07:26.087 --> 01:07:29.507
{Y:i}At Camp Mowester, where three
killer whales remain stranded...

01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:33.762
{Y:i}... the protective booming
is already under way.

01:07:53.072 --> 01:07:54.574
Jesse.

01:07:54.824 --> 01:07:57.160
Jesse! What's going on?

01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:01.498
The boom will seal off the cove,
keep out oil, protect the whales.

01:08:01.748 --> 01:08:03.833
Protect them? You mean trap them.

01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:09.172
If they swim out of the cove, they're
gonna swim right into the oil and die.

01:08:09.422 --> 01:08:13.677
- They can't get back to their family.
- It's for their own good.

01:08:13.885 --> 01:08:17.013
Don't you understand?
None of this is for their own good.

01:08:17.264 --> 01:08:21.434
Not hurting them in the first place
would have been for their own good.

01:08:21.643 --> 01:08:25.313
It's all just a bunch of bull!

01:08:25.563 --> 01:08:27.482
Jesse!

01:08:27.732 --> 01:08:31.986
I'm not so sure about this, Kate.

01:08:33.404 --> 01:08:36.992
{Y:i}We at Benbrook Oil have arranged
for the whales...

01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:39.035
{Y:i}... to be lifted out of the cove...

01:08:39.243 --> 01:08:45.207
{Y:i}... and taken to a rescue center
to be cared for while they recuperate.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:48.627
Roll the harness! Roll the harness.

01:08:48.877 --> 01:08:54.426
I wanna take the little one in first.
Take the little one first.

01:08:55.593 --> 01:08:59.055
Keep in there. Keep in there.

01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:15.071
Thanks!

01:09:15.321 --> 01:09:16.990
Jesse!

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.450
Where have you been?

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:23.580
Saving your butt, that's where. There
were these guys in a donut shop...

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:27.457
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you, but trust me.

01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:30.920
Why should I trust you?

01:09:33.089 --> 01:09:37.301
Because nobody ever has.

01:09:40.305 --> 01:09:42.182
- That way.
- Move in.

01:09:42.432 --> 01:09:43.767
Hold it.

01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:47.062
Looking good.

01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:58.239
Keep moving him in.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:01.743
All right.

01:10:01.868 --> 01:10:04.871
Okay. Work him in here.

01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:07.749
Take him back.

01:10:11.127 --> 01:10:13.004
Close him off. Close him off.

01:10:13.213 --> 01:10:15.006
Get him in.

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:18.635
- Where are you going?
- Hey, you can't capture whales.

01:10:18.885 --> 01:10:22.264
Get off of me. Leave me alone.

01:10:25.016 --> 01:10:28.186
Watch out. Come on. Move.
You lied. You're a liar.

01:10:28.437 --> 01:10:33.191
- You're gonna sell them to an aquarium.
- They will be returned to J Pod...

01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:35.110
Not if he's got
anything to do with it.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.446
You're gonna lock them up.
He heard everything.

01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:43.285
- You're gonna have to leave, kids.
- We're just trying to save the whales.

01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:48.039
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- No way.

01:11:00.635 --> 01:11:05.390
- I said I want these kids out of here.
- You promised.

01:11:06.766 --> 01:11:10.312
- John, give me your hand!
- You jerk!

01:11:12.146 --> 01:11:13.940
That's for Littlespot, you jerk!

01:11:14.148 --> 01:11:16.651
I believe you.
I don't know what we can do.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.486
- I do.
- Go for it.

01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:20.530
Come on, guys.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.783
John, don't look back.
Get out of here.

01:11:24.034 --> 01:11:26.369
Don't look back.
Just keep swimming.

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:29.664
- Give me your hand.
- Get away from me!

01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:34.502
- Get me out!
- Where are those kids?

01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:37.380
Jesse, look!

01:12:04.658 --> 01:12:07.619
- Yeah!
- Way to go, Willy!

01:12:08.954 --> 01:12:11.998
- Elvis, meet us over there.
- Be careful.

01:12:12.249 --> 01:12:15.293
Help! Get away from here!

01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:26.471
Come on, let's go. Come on.

01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:29.349
- What are we doing?
- Just untie the back line.

01:12:29.599 --> 01:12:34.187
Back line, back line.
Okay. All right.

01:12:34.395 --> 01:12:39.567
- Do you know how to drive this thing?
- Define "drive".

01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:48.910
- Come on, Jesse. Come on.
- Okay, Elvis.

01:12:49.119 --> 01:12:52.080
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Jump in.

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:53.790
- Got you.
- Let's go!

01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:57.043
All right, I got you.

01:12:57.377 --> 01:13:00.213
- Way to go, Elvis.
- Put this on.

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:03.591
Get those kids out the water!
Get them out!

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.846
- Do you really know how to drive this?
- Not really.

01:13:08.096 --> 01:13:09.848
Come on. Let's go.

01:13:10.098 --> 01:13:13.602
They're coming after us.

01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:18.481
Yeah, guess again.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.865
- Did you do that?
- Yeah!

01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:29.659
Yes!

01:13:31.036 --> 01:13:32.495
Do you see Willy?

01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:37.500
I see Littlespot and Luna,
but I don't see Willy.

01:13:48.219 --> 01:13:52.140
Come here, boy.
Come on, boy. Come on.

01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:57.354
Hey, boy. Yeah.

01:13:57.562 --> 01:14:00.231
Kid is nuts.

01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:03.943
See that boom?
We're gonna get you out.

01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:09.991
It's gonna be okay, I promise. Remember
the old days? Remember this?

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.410
Yeah, you remember.

01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:15.205
- What does that signal mean?
- Give them a show.

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:19.792
You see that boom?
You gotta break it.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.985
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:14:55.161 --> 01:14:57.747
- We did it, you guys! All right!
- Yeah!

01:14:57.998 --> 01:15:00.750
- Yes!
- All right!

01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:04.087
Forget it. Let's go!

01:15:21.688 --> 01:15:25.733
They made it around the point.

01:15:27.235 --> 01:15:32.282
- Honey, isn't that your boat?
- It sure is. And that's Elvis. Come on.

01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:36.536
- Yeah.
- All right!

01:15:36.786 --> 01:15:40.791
We gotta make sure
they get past the oil.

01:15:49.424 --> 01:15:54.346
Authorities say that when engineers
tried to start the ship's generator...

01:15:54.596 --> 01:15:59.100
...the fuel vapors ignited, causing a fire
below deck on the starboard side.

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:06.149
Efforts to contain the blaze continue.
All island residents are being evacuated.

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:24.792
- Get on!
- What's happened?

01:16:25.043 --> 01:16:30.799
There's been an explosion.
That oil can catch fire. Let's go!

01:16:43.603 --> 01:16:45.521
Oh, no! The oil's on fire!

01:16:45.772 --> 01:16:50.193
- What?
- The oil's on fire!

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.072
They can't be much further.

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:06.167
Just hang on, you guys. We have to
follow them till they're safe.

01:17:11.714 --> 01:17:16.094
They're diving.
They're going under the fire!

01:17:33.486 --> 01:17:35.739
They made it under the fire!

01:17:35.947 --> 01:17:39.951
What about us?
We have to get out of here!

01:17:41.161 --> 01:17:44.539
The cove! Hang on, guys.
We're gonna head into that cove!

01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:47.834
Hurry, Jesse. Go!

01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:50.211
- Hey, guys!
- What?

01:17:50.461 --> 01:17:52.297
- I think I see something!
- What?

01:17:52.505 --> 01:17:55.592
- I don't know!
- Watch out!

01:17:57.677 --> 01:17:59.387
What'd we hit?

01:17:59.638 --> 01:18:05.101
Come on, start! Turn over. Come on!
Come on, start!

01:18:05.185 --> 01:18:08.438
- What are we gonna do?
- Water in the boat! Put this on.

01:18:08.688 --> 01:18:11.065
- What about yours?
- Don't worry about me!

01:18:11.274 --> 01:18:14.360
Just get a bucket and
start getting the water out.

01:18:14.611 --> 01:18:17.989
Mayday, Mayday! This is the
"Natselane" off Turner Point.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:23.495
There's a small pleasure-craft
trapped in the fire!

01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:29.000
Guys, hurry! Keep trying to get the
water out! Come on, Elvis!

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:31.836
Come on!

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:37.509
{Y:i}Coastal Marine Patrol, this is
Search and Rescue One. Copy.

01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:45.559
- I can't get a grip!
- Jesse, look!

01:18:45.809 --> 01:18:47.519
We're trapped, Jesse!

01:18:47.769 --> 01:18:52.815
Let's make a U-turn, you guys!
Let's head for the opening! Come on!

01:18:53.066 --> 01:18:54.359
- Push!
- Okay!

01:18:54.609 --> 01:18:57.153
- Okay, now paddle!
- Come on!

01:18:57.404 --> 01:18:59.489
Come on, you guys! Paddle out!

01:18:59.739 --> 01:19:02.033
- Jesse!
- Elvis!

01:19:02.284 --> 01:19:05.954
Jesse!

01:19:07.164 --> 01:19:09.541
- Keep going!
- We're almost there!

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:11.793
- We gotta get out of here!
- Hurry!

01:19:12.043 --> 01:19:15.880
It's closing! Come on!

01:19:16.631 --> 01:19:18.383
No!

01:19:18.633 --> 01:19:22.178
No! No!

01:19:22.595 --> 01:19:26.725
The flames are getting closer!

01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:33.731
Jesse? Jesse, if you get me
out of this, I swear...

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:37.819
...I won't do anything
to hurt you anymore. Please.

01:19:38.069 --> 01:19:40.905
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:46.328
- We're gonna drown.
- You're gonna be okay.

01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:54.502
- See them?
- What is that?

01:19:56.379 --> 01:19:59.174
- It's a helicopter!
- Over here! Help!

01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:02.010
- Look, there!
- I got them.

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:06.556
- Here!
- We're down here!

01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:10.018
- Over here!
- The boat's sinking!

01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:14.772
- They're sending the harness.
- Okay.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.151
- Grab it, Jesse! Grab it!
- You first, Elvis.

01:20:18.401 --> 01:20:20.779
Arms in first!

01:20:21.029 --> 01:20:25.200
- You're the best brother I ever had!
- I'm the only brother you ever had!

01:20:25.408 --> 01:20:31.289
- It's just like bungee jumping!
- I never went bungee jumping! I lied!

01:20:32.124 --> 01:20:34.667
Hang on!

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:41.883
You're going next!

01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:44.552
- Here!
- Get him to the back!

01:20:44.803 --> 01:20:47.472
It's okay, he's in!

01:20:47.847 --> 01:20:52.310
- Hurry! The fire!
- Come on, hurry!

01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:59.984
- Put your arms in!
- What about you?

01:21:00.235 --> 01:21:02.529
- Don't worry about me!
- I can't do this!

01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:05.740
- Go up! Go up! Now!
- No, no, no!

01:21:05.991 --> 01:21:09.536
Hang on! Don't look down!

01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:17.335
Hang on!

01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:21.506
- Come on, Nadine!
- Come on!

01:21:21.756 --> 01:21:26.970
- Get Jesse! Get Jesse!
- Hurry!

01:21:28.638 --> 01:21:30.390
Help! Help!

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:35.645
- Jesse!
- The harness!

01:21:36.479 --> 01:21:39.315
Jesse, come on!

01:21:45.447 --> 01:21:49.326
Good! Good! Hang on, Jesse!

01:21:51.077 --> 01:21:53.747
Go!

01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:59.544
The whole thing might blow!
We gotta get out of here!

01:22:00.336 --> 01:22:03.214
Hang on, Jesse!

01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:07.761
Jesse, come on!

01:22:10.931 --> 01:22:13.558
You're almost here, Jesse.
You can make it!

01:22:13.808 --> 01:22:16.770
Closer!

01:22:16.812 --> 01:22:19.439
Jesse! Come on!

01:22:20.148 --> 01:22:23.818
Jesse! Come on!

01:22:27.113 --> 01:22:29.699
- No!
- No!

01:22:30.492 --> 01:22:34.871
- We lost him! He's not on the ship!
- Jesse, no!

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:40.460
- No! Jesse!
- Come on!

01:22:47.467 --> 01:22:51.012
- We gotta go back down!
- Smoke's choking the engine. I gotta land.

01:22:51.221 --> 01:22:54.266
Backup ship will be here in a second.
Get inside!

01:22:54.516 --> 01:22:57.519
No, not seconds! No!

01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:02.023
No! Jesse!

01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:05.318
Jesse!

01:24:17.807 --> 01:24:19.851
- Jesse!
- You see anything?

01:24:20.101 --> 01:24:23.062
Nothing!

01:24:31.071 --> 01:24:33.990
Oh, my God, there's Jesse!
Jesus. Stop the boat!

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.577
Jesse!

01:24:37.702 --> 01:24:41.164
- Hold on, Jesse!
- Jesse! Hold on!

01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:42.415
Good boy.

01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:45.084
- Jesse, are you okay?
- I'm okay!

01:24:45.335 --> 01:24:46.377
Come on!

01:24:46.628 --> 01:24:48.588
- Reach up.
- We're gonna grab you!

01:24:48.797 --> 01:24:52.550
That's it. Foot up.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.680
What were you doing?

01:25:00.725 --> 01:25:04.145
I love you.

01:25:09.067 --> 01:25:11.694
You saved his life, Willy.
Thank you.

01:25:11.945 --> 01:25:17.033
- Thanks, boy!
- That's the best friend you ever had.

01:25:17.701 --> 01:25:20.537
I'll say.

01:25:29.045 --> 01:25:31.965
Go on, boy.

01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:36.261
It's okay. I'm okay.

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:41.766
How come he won't go?

01:25:42.017 --> 01:25:45.145
I don't know, Jess.

01:26:02.579 --> 01:26:05.248
I love you.

01:26:07.375 --> 01:26:10.670
Bye.

01:26:14.174 --> 01:26:17.844
- Bye, Willy.
- So long, Willy.

01:26:42.744 --> 01:26:45.956
Bye.

01:26:48.625 --> 01:26:50.251
- Pull alongside.
- Randolph!

01:26:50.501 --> 01:26:52.337
Oh, my God, honey, look! Hey!

01:26:52.587 --> 01:26:54.005
Jesse?

01:26:54.255 --> 01:26:56.716
- Nadine, Jesse's okay!
- You're okay!

01:26:56.925 --> 01:26:59.636
- Are you all right?
- Nadine, you okay?

01:26:59.886 --> 01:27:02.222
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Okay, let's go.

01:27:02.472 --> 01:27:04.766
- Guys, you made it.
- Yeah, I got him.

01:27:04.975 --> 01:27:08.103
- Thank you very much. Thank you!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:27:08.353 --> 01:27:11.773
Got them, Randolph.
Let's get out of here!

01:27:12.023 --> 01:27:14.442
Here you go. Thanks a lot!

01:27:14.651 --> 01:27:19.197
- Thank you, guys!
- You're welcome!

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.784
I'm so glad you're okay!

01:27:27.247 --> 01:27:29.749
What are you looking at?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.460
What are you looking at?

01:27:32.710 --> 01:27:36.214
This is for you.

01:27:36.798 --> 01:27:40.051
What is it?

01:27:42.262 --> 01:27:44.931
What the heck?

01:27:47.058 --> 01:27:48.185
Mom?

01:27:48.435 --> 01:27:50.979
It had a little accident, but...

01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:53.773
...I taped it back together.

01:27:54.023 --> 01:27:55.817
Thanks.

01:27:56.067 --> 01:27:59.821
She talked about you all the time.

01:28:00.155 --> 01:28:04.409
She felt bad about what happened.

01:28:09.372 --> 01:28:12.375
Thank you.

01:28:16.754 --> 01:28:19.215
She loved you.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.517
So, what do you think?

01:28:28.767 --> 01:28:32.270
I think it'd be a shame
to break up a set.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.898
Where are the fish?
Where's Littlespot?

01:28:35.148 --> 01:28:40.278
Littlespot, Luna and Willy
are back with their mom.

01:28:40.528 --> 01:28:43.406
How do you know?

01:28:47.077 --> 01:28:49.871
I know.
