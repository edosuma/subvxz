IS IT TERRIBLE?

00:18.350 --> 00:20.716
- UH, NO,

00:20.750 --> 00:23.480
IT'S BORDERLINE NONEXISTENT.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.078
IT FEELS LIKE THE BLOOD

00:25.120 --> 00:26.587
OUT OF THE BACK
OF MY HEAD, BILLY.

00:26.620 --> 00:27.757

IT'S, LIKE, OUR THIRD ONE.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.439
- WE'RE TRYING
TO IMPRESS CHIEF DICK.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.702
- YEAH, UH, LOOK,
WHY ARE YOU BRINGING UP

01:23.750 --> 01:25.502
THIS WHOLE
MELINDA LANE BUSINESS?

01:25.550 --> 01:29.441
- BECAUSE, LIPPS, THERE ARE
SOME VERY INTERESTING TIDBITS

01:29.490 --> 01:30.843
IN YOUR RECENTLY
RELEASED BIOGRAPHY

01:30.890 --> 01:32.289
THAT SHED
SOME DAMNING NEW LIGHT

01:32.320 --> 01:34.413
ON THE MELINDA LANE
MURDER INVESTIGATION.

01:34.460 --> 01:35.882
- HUH, THAT'S MY BOOK.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.888
- YOU REMEMBER MELINDA,
DON'T YOU, BILLY?

01:37.930 --> 01:40.251
- SORRY, BILLY. I'M THE ONE
THAT TIPPED THEM OFF.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.518
BUT DON'T WORRY--I TOLD THEM
THAT YOU COULD EXPLAIN AWAY

01:42.570 --> 01:44.219
ANY TIDBITS THEY MAY HAVE.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.137
- HA.
- FOR EXAMPLE, AND I QUOTE,

01:47.170 --> 01:48.660
"I WOKE UP IN MY BED
THAT FATEFUL NIGHT

01:48.700 --> 01:50.861
"AND COULDN'T HELP BUT SMELL
MELINDA'S PERFUME

01:50.910 --> 01:52.832
THAT SHE ALWAYS WORE
ALL OVER ME."

01:52.880 --> 01:55.508
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.
- SORRY.

01:55.540 --> 01:58.907
- NOW, BILLY, IN OUR PREVIOUS
INTERVIEWS, YOU STATED

01:58.950 --> 02:00.679
THAT YOU AND MELINDA
DIDN'T SPEAK

02:00.720 --> 02:03.280
THE NIGHT SHE WAS MURDERED
BECAUSE OF A FALLING OUT.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.912
NOW, IF THAT WERE THE CASE,

02:04.950 --> 02:07.259
WHY WAS HER SCENT
ALL OVER YOUR CLOTHES?

02:07.290 --> 02:09.258
DON'T ANSWER THAT YET.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.827
CHAPTER FOUR--
"I HAD SCRATCHES ON MY CHEST,

02:11.860 --> 02:13.691
"BUT THE DENSE, MEERKAT-LIKE FUR
THAT COVERS MY TORSO

02:13.730 --> 02:15.823
MADE THEM INVISIBLE
TO THE NAKED EYE."

02:15.860 --> 02:18.260
- WHO GAVE YOU
THOSE SCRATCHES, BILLY?

02:18.300 --> 02:20.291
WAS IT MELINDA LANE,
AS YOU SMOTHERED HER FACE

02:20.340 --> 02:21.637
WITH A PILLOW
AND MURDERED HER?

02:21.670 --> 02:23.331
- GO AHEAD, BILLY.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.271
READ HIM THE RIOT ACT, MAN.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.866
- SHAWN, I HAVE WANTED TO GO

03:27.900 --> 03:29.333
SINCE I MOVED
TO SANTA BARBARA.

03:29.370 --> 03:30.769
IT'S A STUNNING LANDMARK.

THAT WE DON'T KNOW

03:39.920 --> 03:41.842
WHO INVITED US
OR WHY WE WERE INVITED?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.541
- JULES, I THINK
IT'S MYSTERIOUS BY DESIGN.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.683
IT MAY BE ONE OF THOSE
EYES WIDE SHUT SHINDIGS

03:45.720 --> 03:47.551
WITH THE MASKS
OR A BOOGIE NIGHTS SHINDIG

03:47.590 --> 03:48.818

04:14.450 --> 04:16.418
THERE'S STILL AN OUTSIDE
CHANCE I MIGHT MAKE IT LATER.

CAN WATCH HIM

08:54.960 --> 08:55.858
WHILE YOU ENJOY A NIGHT OUT.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.026

08:57.070 --> 09:00.198
HE'S NEVER MET HIS FATHER!

09:00.240 --> 09:02.128
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.174
IN YOUR RECENTLY RELEASED
BIOGRAPHY.

10:22.220 --> 10:23.744

10:29.190 --> 10:33.024
LONGTIME MANAGER OF BILLY LIPPS
AND THE GUYS BEHIND ME,

10:33.060 --> 10:35.699
WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT HE DIDN'T
CALL YOU A "GAY SNOOPY."

10:35.730 --> 10:37.994
HE WAS SAYING YOU WERE
THEIR NUMBER-ONE GROUPIE

10:38.030 --> 10:39.224
BACK IN THE DAY.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.016
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING.

10:58.050 --> 11:01.087
AS YOU ALL KNOW, I'VE BEEN IN
PRISON FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS,

11:01.120 --> 11:03.884
SERVING MY SENTENCE
FOR THE MANSLAUGHTER

11:03.930 --> 11:05.750
OF MELINDA LANE.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.929
- UH, SHAWN,
THIS IS AWKWARD.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.927
- LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS
IN THE CLINK,

11:08.960 --> 11:11.724
LIKE PERSEVERANCE,
REDEMPTION,

11:11.770 --> 11:13.897
AND WHEN YOUR
ANDROGYNOUS BUNK MATE "APPETITE"

11:13.940 --> 11:16.033
SAYS HE'S GONNA SHIV YOU FOR
NOT SHARING YOUR CHERRY JUBILEE,

11:16.070 --> 11:17.298
IT'S NOT AN IDLE THREAT.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.035
[cork

- OH! p]

11:19.070 --> 11:22.107
- MIGHT I INQUIRE
WHO THE EMPTY SEAT IS FOR?

11:22.140 --> 11:26.076
- MY GUESS IS RIP,
BUT HE'LL NEVER SHOW.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.772
HE HATES HIGHWAY HARRY
WITH A PASSION

11:28.820 --> 11:31.084
BECAUSE HE SHAFI'ED HIM
ON SONG ROYALTIES.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.485
I'M IN MENSA.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.886
- BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT
IS THAT I DISCOVERED

11:34.920 --> 11:37.024
THE POWER OF FAITH.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.755
I FOUND GOD.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.758
JESUS.
- OH.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.097
- AND I ASKED THEM
TO STRIKE DOWN APPETITE

11:42.130 --> 11:44.792
WITH A HOLY VENGEANCE.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.388
BUT THEY DIDN'T,
SO NOW I'M JEWISH.

11:46.430 --> 11:49.228
FULL ON.
WEAR THE HAT AND EVERYTHING.

11:49.270 --> 11:51.932

11:51.970 --> 11:53.938
- SERIOUSLY, HARRY.
I'M JEWISH.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.208
YOU CAN'T TELL
THOSE JOKES ANYMORE.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.798
- BARBRA STREISAND.
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.909
- STEVEN SPIELBERG.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.019
- BENIHANA.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.870

- STOP IT.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.979
- RICARDO MONTALBAN.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.488
- ANYWAY, THE REASON THAT
I BROUGHT YOU ALL HERE TONIGHT

12:06.520 --> 12:08.488
IS TO TELL YOU THAT PRISON

12:08.520 --> 12:11.057
WAS THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.751
I MEAN, SURE,
MY GORGEOUS ANGEL OF A WIFE

12:12.800 --> 12:14.290

THE BLOND BASTARD-FACE
FROM DANCING WITH THE STARS,

12:17.370 --> 12:19.793
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OKAY.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.161
I'M CLEAN NOW.
I'M SOBER.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.101
I'M WRITING SONGS AGAIN.
I'M CIRCUMCISED.

DON'T.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.505
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.917
THIS IS A CELEBRATION
IS WHAT IT IS!

12:34.950 --> 12:37.180
IT'S A CELEBRATION
OF NEW BEGINNINGS...

12:37.220 --> 12:39.381
AND OF LIFE!

THE TRUTH *

13:01.110 --> 13:02.805
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

13:02.850 --> 13:04.340
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

13:04.380 --> 13:05.506
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

13:05.550 --> 13:07.814
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

13:07.850 --> 13:09.545
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

13:09.580 --> 13:12.310
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

13:18.960 --> 13:21.224
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M A REGISTERED NURSE.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.194
SORRY.
I WAS A REGISTERED NURSE.

13:23.230 --> 13:26.961
I WAS TER-T-T-TER--TER--

13:27.000 --> 13:27.967
- SPIT IT OUT, WOMAN.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.467

[gaSPSJ

13:33.240 --> 13:35.470
THIS MAN IS DEAD.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.943
[all gasp]

13:36.980 --> 13:38.948
- I, FOR ONE,
AM NOT SURPRISED.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.210
I MEAN, THE MAN HAD
ONE FUNCTIONING VALVE

13:41.250 --> 13:42.217
IN HIS HEART.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.615
- MARTIN'S RIGHT.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.117
I MEAN, HIGHWAY HAS
FLAT-LINED AND DIED

13:45.150 --> 13:46.242
AT LEAST TEN TIMES BEFORE.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.588
- I, TOO, AM SADDENED
BY THE PASSING OF HIGHWAY HARRY.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.453
SO, IN HIS HONOR, I WOULD LIKE
TO VOLUNTEER TO EAT HIS MEAL.

13:51.490 --> 13:52.525
- WE'RE SPLI'I'I'ING THAT FOOD
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.096
- TOO LATE, SHAWN.
I CALLED IT.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.358
- WE SPLIT THE FOOD
OF THE DEAD 50/50.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.389
- MAN!
- THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE DEAL.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.193
- FINE!
- LISTEN UP.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.039
TONIGHT'S MITZVAH WILL NOW BE
IN HIGHWAY'S HONOR.

14:00.070 --> 14:03.369
AND A PROPER KEVURAH--
THAT MEANS FUNERAL--

14:03.410 --> 14:07.335
WILL TAKE PLACE MAANA
ONCE WE PERFORM THE TAHARA.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.972
- DID HE JUST DO A MASH-UP
OF YIDDISH AND SPANISH?

14:09.010 --> 14:10.307
- HE SURE DID.
IT'S LIKE A MATZO-DILLA.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.102
- THAT SOUNDS DELICIOUS.

14:12.150 --> 14:15.017
- EXCUSE ME, BILLY,
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S JEWISH.

14:15.050 --> 14:17.086
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, MATE.
- SO WHY DOES HIGHWAY HARRY...

14:19.490 --> 14:21.355
- WAIT A MINUTE.

MY FAITH?

14:25.360 --> 14:26.952
- HAVA NAGILA!

14:27.000 --> 14:29.298
HAVA!
I'M HAVING A VISION.

14:29.330 --> 14:31.366

THAT EMPTY SEAT WAS MEANT
FOR BILLY'S LOYAL GUITARIST,

14:57.030 --> 14:59.089
BUT HERE'S THE TWIST.

14:59.130 --> 15:01.052
HE'S BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT LONG,
LIONEL RICHIE STYLE,

15:01.100 --> 15:03.125
LURKING,
WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

15:03.170 --> 15:04.228
TO GET BACK AT HIGHWAY HARRY

15:04.270 --> 15:06.022
FOR CHEATING HIM
OUT OF SONG ROYALTIES.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.595
THIS MAN DID NOT DIE
OF NATURAL CAUSES.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.062
- SAY WHAT?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.168
- HE WAS HIT IN THE BACK
OF THE HEAD

15:11.210 --> 15:12.404
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.238
- UH, SHAWN, WE NEED TO CALL
LASSIE AND JULES IMMEDIATELY.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.271
- YES, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

15:17.310 --> 15:18.948
- [gaSPSJ

15:25.990 --> 15:27.548
- THE LINE IS DEAD.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.114

15:29.160 --> 15:32.527
I EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR ONE
YEARS AGO,

15:32.560 --> 15:35.120
WHEN I WAS AT HARVARD.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.993
- OOH! OOH! THESE PORK-BELLY

OF GOD'S HEROIN MEAT.

SO THAT WE CAN CALL
THE POLICE.

- THEY'RE GONE.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.970

I'LL TAKE MY MAIN COURSE

15:57.220 --> 15:59.415
AND MY HALF
OF HIGHWAY HARRY'S MEAL TO GO.

15:59.450 --> 16:00.758
- GUS, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.758
- HOME TO MY GIRL
AND ANOTHER MAN'S CHILD.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.458
I TOLD YOU
THERE WAS A PANTHER OUT THERE.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.105
- HEY, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

16:19.140 --> 16:21.108
BILLY, YOU REALLY HAVE
A PET PANTHER?

16:21.140 --> 16:23.142
- YEAH, I DO--
EMMA.

16:23.180 --> 16:24.477
OH, SHE'S A PEACH,

16:24.510 --> 16:26.000
WHEN SHE'S RESTING OR, LIKE,

16:26.050 --> 16:28.041
WHEN SHE'S NOT BROKEN FREE
OF HER CHAINS.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.342
BUT IF SHE'S OUT AND ABOUT,
SHE'LL TAKE YOUR FACE OFF.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.779
- HE'S KIDDING.
- NO, LITERALLY.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.310
SHE TOOK A FRIEND OF MINE'S
FACE RIGHT OFF.

16:32.350 --> 16:33.783
- HE'S NOT KIDDING.
- TOLD YOU.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.653
- HELL OF A FLAUTIST, THOUGH.
THE REAL BALLS, YEAH.

AND YOUR BOSOM IS FULL,
AND TH--THERE ARE SIX OF US,

17:14.100 --> 17:15.727
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE RIP.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.819
- SHAWN, ARE YOU SAYING
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING?

17:17.870 --> 17:19.064
- ABSOLUTELY.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.658
- RIGHT.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.236
- WHAT--
- NO, NO, BILLY, BILLY, BILLY.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.831
I'M SAYING WE SHOULD ALL
SPLIT UP INTO PAIRS

17:25.870 --> 17:28.077
AND SEARCH THE HOUSE FOR RIP.

17:30.610 --> 17:33.215
- RIGHT.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.569
- RIGHT.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.178
RIGHT?

17:42.890 --> 17:44.778
THIS MUST BE CLIZBY'S ROOM.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.252
- TELL YOU WHAT.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.292
WHEN WE FIND RIP,
I'M GONNA BITE HIM BACK

17:48.330 --> 17:51.788
FOR HAVING BI'I'I'EN ME WITH
HIS LITTLE SEWER-RAT TEETH.

17:51.830 --> 17:54.867
- RIP BIT YOU?

17:54.900 --> 17:56.595
OH, THAT IS SO COOL.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.564
- [chuckles] I MEAN, GRANTED,
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF THIS, RIGHT?

17:59.610 --> 18:01.669
BUT APPARENTLY RIP AND I GOT
INTO THIS HUGE BRAWL

18:01.710 --> 18:03.405
YEARS AGO
OVER MELINDA LANE.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.338
HE FELT THAT SHE WAS TOXIC
TO THE BAND

18:05.380 --> 18:09.248
'CAUSE SHE LOVED ME
BUT ALSO FANCIED HARRY.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.781
PICKED ME, OF COURSE.

18:10.820 --> 18:13.186
- BEEN THERE.
[laughing]

18:13.220 --> 18:15.108
YEAH, GUS ONCE BIT ME
FOR STEALING HIS HONEY.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.286
- AH, WOMEN.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.753
- YEAH, COULD BARELY
BLAME HIM, THOUGH.

18:17.790 --> 18:19.280
HE HAD JUST GOTI'EN
SOME GRAHAM CRACKERS

18:19.330 --> 18:22.197
AND HAD NOTHING
TO DIP THEM IN.

18:26.870 --> 18:31.705
- I'VE BEEN WITH MY BOSS
FOR 25 YEARS.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.731
- BORING!
CLEAR!

18:33.780 --> 18:34.804
- COPY.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.779
[thunder booms]

18:37.810 --> 18:39.869
- MAN, I KNEW
THEY WERE GOING TO STICK

18:39.910 --> 18:41.309
THE TWO BLACK DUDES TOGETHER.

18:41.350 --> 18:43.910
THIS EITHER ENDS WITH US DEAD
OR IN JAIL.

18:43.950 --> 18:45.281
- MAN, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO BUY

18:45.320 --> 18:47.185
INTO ALL THOSE
BLACK STEREOTYPES?

18:47.220 --> 18:48.710
- SAYS THE BLACK BUTLER.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.580
- TOUCHE, MY BROTHER.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.881
- HMM.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.854
UH, CLIZBY...
- HUH?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.266
- WERE BILLY AND MARTIN
WORKING ON ANOTHER BOOK?

18:57.300 --> 18:59.393
- MORE LIKE FIGHTING
ABOUT ANOTHER BOOK.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.489
IN HERE ALL HOURS
OF THE NIGHT,

19:01.540 --> 19:05.203
YELLING, THROWING STUFF.

19:05.970 --> 19:10.248
I USE IT TO CARAMELIZE.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.804
- I HEAR THAT.

19:11.850 --> 19:15.274
- HMM.
[chuckles]

19:15.320 --> 19:16.810
- HEY, RIP!

19:16.850 --> 19:18.545
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.455
- DO THE RIGHT THING, MATE.
OWN UP TO IT.

19:20.490 --> 19:23.550
GO TO PRISON LIKE I DID.
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK.

19:23.590 --> 19:24.921
[quietly]
THAT'S A LIE.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.757
IT'S WHERE SOULS GO TO DIE.
REALLY.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.897
- SO THIS IS WHERE
ALL THE MAGIC HAPPENS, HUH?

19:30.930 --> 19:33.569
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
THIS SPOT RIGHT HERE--

19:33.600 --> 19:35.636
THIS IS THE REASON
WHY I RENTED THIS MANSION,

19:35.670 --> 19:36.898
[fake echoing]
ITS PERFECT-ECT-ECT...

19:36.940 --> 19:38.567
ACOUSTICS-ICS-ICS. ..

19:38.610 --> 19:39.838
LISTEN.

19:39.870 --> 19:43.249
*AH

19:43.280 --> 19:44.247
both: * AH

19:44.280 --> 19:45.349
[rattling]

19:45.380 --> 19:46.642
[paintball gun fires]

19:46.680 --> 19:49.672
- [shrieks]

19:51.620 --> 19:53.815
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.884
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

19:54.920 --> 19:57.889
[feminine voice shrieks]

19:59.430 --> 20:01.591
- THIS IS SOME BULLS--

20:01.630 --> 20:04.326
[feminine voice shrieks]

20:05.970 --> 20:09.269
- CLIZBY, DO THE HONORS,
WILL YOU?

20:09.300 --> 20:11.666
COME ON.

20:12.710 --> 20:15.531
[feminine voice shrieks]

20:18.280 --> 20:20.942
[feminine voice shrieks]

20:20.980 --> 20:24.814
- SBPD.
EXTINGUISH THAT TORCH.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.681
- GUS?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.984
SHAWN, YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T
BRING ANYONE ELSE.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.920
- NO, SWEETHEART,
I INVITED YOU FIRST.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.928
AND THEN I BROUGHT GUS.
YOU FOLLOW?

20:32.960 --> 20:34.791
- NO.
- YOU WILL.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.821
- SO WHAT? YOU COME TO ARREST ME
AGAIN, HAVE YOU?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.521
- FIRST OFF,
YOU MIGHT WANT

20:38.570 --> 20:40.390
TO LOWER THAT PAINT GUN,
ALICE COOPER.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.839
SECONDLY, DOES THE NAME
ALBERT SEMENTO

20:41.870 --> 20:43.565
RING ANY BELLS
IN YOUR DEAD HEAD?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.498
- UH, NO.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.939
- WELL, HE'S BEEN MISSING
FOR A FEW DAYS,

20:46.970 --> 20:49.507
AND WE JUST LOCATED HIS CAR
NOT THAT FAR FROM HERE.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.802
- SPA'I'I'ERED WITH BLOOD.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.602
AND GUESS WHAT ADDRESS
WAS ON HIS GPS?

20:52.650 --> 20:53.912
- DO WE ALL GET ONE GUESS?

20:53.950 --> 20:55.918
OR CAN--
- IT'S OBVIOUS...

20:55.950 --> 20:57.281
IT WAS THIS HOUSE.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.811
HI. MARTIN KAHN--
HARVARD.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.556
- CARLTON LASSITER--
SHUT UP.

21:01.590 --> 21:02.852
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ANY ALBERT SEMENTO,

21:02.890 --> 21:04.528
AND THERE'S NO ONE HERE
BY THAT NAME, ALL RIGHT?

21:04.560 --> 21:05.754
- BUT THERE IS SOMEONE HERE

21:05.790 --> 21:07.655
NAMED HIGHWAY HARRY,
AND HE IS DEAD.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.894
- ARE YOU TELLING ME THERE'S
A DEAD PERSON IN THIS HOUSE?

21:08.930 --> 21:10.329
- HE WAS MURDERED BY RIP,
AND, YES,

21:10.370 --> 21:11.769
WE ALREADY CALLED DIBS
ON HIS MEAL.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.824
- AND WHERE'S RIP?

21:12.870 --> 21:14.497
- HE IS SOMEWHERE
IN THIS HOUSE,

21:14.540 --> 21:16.838
KICKING ASS IN A CLASSIC GAME
OF HIDE-AND-SEEK.

21:16.870 --> 21:17.859
- SHOW US THE BODY.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.798
- ALL RIGHT.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.546
- HARRY'S GONE.

21:24.580 --> 21:25.877
- GREAT SCO'I'I',
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.343
- NO, IT ISN'T.

21:27.380 --> 21:28.916
RIP MOVED THE BODY
TO GET RID OF ANY EVIDENCE.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.588
- WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

21:30.620 --> 21:31.882
[all sniffing]

21:31.920 --> 21:33.478
- OH.
GUS STEPPED IN SOME--

21:33.520 --> 21:36.819
- IT'S BURNING LONDON BROIL.
- EXCUSE ME.

21:36.860 --> 21:37.952
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
LISTEN UP.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.651
AS OF 2100 HOURS,
WE ARE OFFICIALLY

21:39.690 --> 21:40.691
ON A PHASE FOUR LOCKDOWN.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.391
- PHASE FOUR?

21:42.430 --> 21:43.988
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER
THREE PHASES, YOU CHEAP BA--

21:44.030 --> 21:48.899
- [screaming]

21:53.110 --> 21:55.431
- OH, MY GOD.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.448
RIP.

21:58.750 --> 22:02.948
- ALSO KNOWN BY HIS BIRTH NAME--
ALBERT SEMENTO.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.379
[all gasp]

22:10.960 --> 22:12.450
- DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME

22:12.490 --> 22:13.889
THAT NONE OF YOU KNEW
RIP'S REAL NAME?

22:13.930 --> 22:15.659
- OKAY,
WE'VE GOT TWO STAB WOUNDS.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.429
LOOKS TO ME
LIKE AN ICE PICK.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.062
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
HOW LONG HE'S BEEN DEAD.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.068
COULD BE TWO DAYS.
COULD BE TWO HOURS.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.499
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, LISTEN UP.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.700
THIS IS OFFICIALLY
A CRIME SCENE,

22:23.740 --> 22:26.061
AND I AM NOW
CALLING THE SHOTS.

22:26.110 --> 22:28.670
AND MY FINELY HONED
INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS

22:28.710 --> 22:30.940
ARE TELLING ME
THAT SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM

22:30.980 --> 22:32.504
IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE MURDERS

22:32.550 --> 22:34.848
OF AL SEMENTO
AND HIGHWAY HARRY.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.939
NOW, I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR

22:36.980 --> 22:39.448
WITH THE 1984 CHUCK NORRIS
CLASSIC, MISSING IN ACTION,

22:39.490 --> 22:41.958
BUT MY PARTNER AND I
ARE ABOUT TO GRILL

22:41.990 --> 22:43.150
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

22:43.190 --> 22:45.784
LIKE COLONEL BRADDOCK
DID THE VIETCONG.

22:45.830 --> 22:47.923
- YEAH, I'M NOT DOING THAT.
- FINE.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.689
BUT IF ANYONE'S GOING TO BE
BOUND AND DENIED OXYGEN,

22:49.730 --> 22:52.119
MIGHT I SUGGEST WE ESTABLISH
SOME CLEAR SAFE WORDS?

22:52.170 --> 22:53.592
- MOVE IT OUT, FREAK SHOW.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.937
- NO, THAT'S TOO MANY WORDS.

22:54.970 --> 22:57.939
I WAS THINKING MORE ALONG
THE LINES OF "STOP."

22:57.970 --> 23:00.006
I'LL BE IN THE DEN.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.406
- THAT'S NOT MY JOB, MAN.

23:05.450 --> 23:07.441
- I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU DID

23:07.480 --> 23:10.688
FROM THE TIME
YOU ARRIVED HERE TONIGHT.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.915
- HARVARD.
WELL, MARTY...

23:12.950 --> 23:13.985
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS

23:14.020 --> 23:16.079
WHEN YOU CRY "HARVARD"
IN PRISON.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.849
A BUNCH OF INMATES
GO TO THE PRISON LIBRARY

23:17.890 --> 23:19.152
AND CHECK OUT
A BUNCH OF BOOKS

23:19.190 --> 23:20.851
THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY READ
COVER TO COVER,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.460
AND THEN THEY TAKE TURNS
BEATING YOU WITH THEM

23:23.500 --> 23:25.798
UNTIL YOU FORGET
YOU EVER WENT TO--

23:25.830 --> 23:27.536
CARE TO GUESS?

23:27.570 --> 23:28.889
- [whimpers]
HARVARD.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.158
- YOU REALLY ARE SMART.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.632
[door locks]

23:33.640 --> 23:35.039
[door locks]

23:37.780 --> 23:39.509
- JUST ANSWER
THE QUESTION, BILLY.

23:39.550 --> 23:42.018
- ALL RIGHT, BUT FIRST,
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

23:42.050 --> 23:45.019
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER
QUI'I'I'ING POLICE WORK

23:45.050 --> 23:47.951
AND GOING ON TOUR
AND SLEEPING WITH ME

23:47.990 --> 23:49.184
AND MY BAND AND MY CREW?

23:49.220 --> 23:50.778
[thunder rumbles]

23:50.830 --> 23:54.027
PROFESSIONALLY.

23:54.060 --> 23:55.925
M&M?

23:55.960 --> 23:57.860
- ALL I KNOW IS I'VE GOT
A FROZEN BODY

23:57.900 --> 23:59.026
AND YOUR ALIBI
DOESN'T HOLD WATER.

23:59.070 --> 24:00.537
NOW START TALKING.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.162
- THIS IS A JOKE,
RIGHT, LASSIE?

24:02.200 --> 24:03.963
- COME ON, MAN, YOU KNOW
I DIDN'T KILL THOSE DUDES.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.228
- HOLD ON. WHY ARE YOU
EMPHASIZING THE WORD "I"?

24:06.270 --> 24:07.237
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.135
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU DISAPPEARED
FOR TEN MINUTES

24:09.180 --> 24:10.807
AFI'ER CLIZBY GAVE US A TOUR
OF THE HOUSE.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.942
- MAN, YOU KNOW
I DOUBLED BACK AROUND

24:11.980 --> 24:13.971
TO THAT BOWL
OF LICORICE PASTELS.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.477
AND WHEN I RETURNED,
GUESS WHO WAS SUSPICIOUSLY GONE.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.249
- MAN, YOU KNOW, I, TOO, CRAVE
THOSE LICORICE PASTELS.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.611
AND I DOUBLED BACK
AFTER YOU DOUBLED BACK.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.651
- LIAR.
I ATE THEM ALL, SUCKER.

24:22.690 --> 24:24.920
- LIAR! YOU ATE ALL OF THEM
BUT THE BLACK ONES.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.086
SUCK IT.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.529
- YOU SUCK IT.
- YOU SUCK IT.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.994
both:
* SUCK IT

24:33.030 --> 24:34.531
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM CLIZBY?

24:34.570 --> 24:35.696
- [lisps] IT'S CLIZBY.
[knocking on door]

24:35.740 --> 24:37.662
- STOP IT!
CLIFBY?

24:37.710 --> 24:41.828
- CLIZBY.
[knocking on door]

24:41.880 --> 24:44.041
- HEY!
- NOT YOU, GUSTER.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.843
- SO WHAT HAVE WE GLEANED
FROM THE GRILLINGS?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.246
- THAT ANY ONE OF THESE GUESTS
COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE MURDERS

24:48.280 --> 24:50.009
AND THAT THEY'RE ALL
POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.517
- LIKE THIS.
OW!

24:51.550 --> 24:53.108
- AND THEY ALL CLAIM
THAT A VAST AMOUNT

24:53.150 --> 24:55.084
OF DIRTY LAUNDRY WAS AIRED
DURING BILLY LIPPS' TRIAL.

24:55.120 --> 24:55.984
APPARENTLY, THEY ALL HAD SOME

24:56.020 --> 24:57.658
PRETTY DAMNING THINGS TO SAY
ABOUT HIM.

24:57.690 --> 24:59.123
- WAIT A MINUTE.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.025
EVERYONE INVITED TONIGHT
TESTIFIED AT BILLY'S TRIAL.

25:01.060 --> 25:01.799
THAT MEANS WE ALL
PLAYED A ROLE

25:01.830 --> 25:03.559
IN SENDING BILLY
OFF TO PRISON--

25:03.600 --> 25:04.999
AN EXPERIENCE
HE CLAIMS WAS A BLESSING,

25:05.030 --> 25:06.759
BUT I BELIEVE DEEP DOWN
HE'S RESENTFUL AND BITTER

25:06.800 --> 25:08.597
THAT HIS WIFE WAS STOLEN
FROM HIM

25:08.640 --> 25:11.029
BY THAT BEAUTIFUL BASTARD-FACE
DANCER DEREK HOUGH--HIS WORDS.

25:11.070 --> 25:12.207
THOUGH I, TOO, WOULD HAVE
CHOSEN THE WORD "DEREK."

25:12.240 --> 25:13.878
OH, MY GOD.

25:13.910 --> 25:15.571
BILLY LIPPS DIDN'T INVITE US
HERE TONIGHT TO CELEBRATE.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.976
HE INVITED US HERE
TO EXACT REVENGE.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.570
HIGHWAY HARRY AND RIP
WERE HIS FIRST VICTIMS.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.973
BUT HE IS PLANNING ON
TAKING US OUT ONE BY ONE

25:22.020 --> 25:23.578
BY ONE BY ONE BY ONE
BY ONE BY ONE.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.838
- SO HE'S GOING TO KILL
FOUR MORE PEOPLE?

25:25.890 --> 25:27.619
- NO. HE'S GOING
TO KILL FIVE MORE PEOPLE.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.878
TWO PLUS ONE PLUS ONE PLUS ONE
PLUS ONE PLUS ONE IS SEVEN.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.821
- LET'S TALK TO LIPPS.
- YEAH.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.850
- LIPPS SPLIT.

25:35.900 --> 25:38.221
THE OTHER GUESTS
ARE IN GRAVE DANGER.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.030
[thunder booms]

25:42.070 --> 25:44.129
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!

25:44.170 --> 25:46.058
WHEN I CALL YOUR NAMES,
YOU ANSWER.

25:46.110 --> 25:48.908
MARTIN!
- DETECTIVE, I HAVE RIGHTS!

25:48.940 --> 25:52.046
- LESLIE!
- I'M FL--FL--FLAB--

25:52.080 --> 25:53.342
- FLABBERGASTED?

25:53.380 --> 25:57.942
- MAN, YOU KNOW I'M IN HERE.
- GUSTER.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.981
GUSTER?
- GUS?

26:01.890 --> 26:03.949
GUS?
[thunder booms]

26:03.990 --> 26:06.857
GUS?

26:06.890 --> 26:09.256
OH, NO.
BILLY MUST HAVE TAKEN HIM.

26:09.300 --> 26:12.098
- HOW IN THE HELL DID LIPPS
GET OUT OF THE DEN,

26:12.130 --> 26:14.928
INTO THE LIVING ROOM, AND ABDUCT
GUS WITHOUT ANYONE SEEING HIM?

26:14.970 --> 26:16.631
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
I LEFT HIM.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.604
AND I BROUGHT HIM
AS MY PLUS-ONE.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.835
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU,
JULES.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.869
- SHAWN.

26:21.910 --> 26:24.344
[gunshot]

26:29.980 --> 26:32.346
IS SOMEWHERE
OFF THE LIVING ROOM.

26:34.790 --> 26:37.623
- GUS?

26:37.660 --> 26:39.218
- ALL I KNOW IS
I'VE GOT A FROZEN BODY

26:39.260 --> 26:40.386
AND YOUR ALIBI
DOESN'T HOLD WATER.

26:40.430 --> 26:42.921
NOW START TALKING!

26:42.960 --> 26:44.166
- DID YOU GO LOOKING FOR...

26:44.200 --> 26:46.828
[French accent]
THE CHOCOLATE ROOM?

26:59.810 --> 27:03.177
YOU DESERVED BETTER,
MY MAGNIFICENT FRIEND.

- TOUPEES.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.118

27:15.160 --> 27:16.957
- OH, NO. GUS.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.661
- [crying]
I-I-I THOUGHT--

27:18.700 --> 27:22.989
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE CHOCOLATE ROOM.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.359
- I KNOW YOU DID, BUDDY.
COME ON, LET'S--

27:24.410 --> 27:25.763
LET'S GET OUT OF YOU HERE.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.732
- [sobbing] NO, NO.
- COME ON.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.179
YOU CAN DO IT.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.918
[thunder booms]

27:37.050 --> 27:39.041
- I FOUND GUS.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.387
- HE DOESN'T LOOK ALL RIGHT.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.456
- [groans]
I THOUGHT IT WAS CHOCOLATE.

27:42.490 --> 27:43.957
- I KNOW.

27:43.990 --> 27:47.027
- I'VE WRITTEN A NEW SONG!

27:47.060 --> 27:49.119
- [whimpering]

27:52.870 --> 27:54.758
[thunder booms]

27:54.800 --> 27:56.028
- HOW THE HELL DID YOU ALL
GET OUT OF YOUR ROOMS?

27:56.070 --> 27:57.389
- I'VE WRITTEN A SONG!

27:57.440 --> 27:59.237
YOW, YEAH!

27:59.270 --> 28:02.933
'CAUSE I'M A GENIUS
IN ME OWN GENES.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.301
GATHER ROUND.
COME ON, PEOPLE.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.376
OH, AFTER-PARTY
WILL BE IN MY PANTS.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.945
IT'S A HIT SONG
THAT I HAVE PENNED...

28:10.990 --> 28:12.309
[strums guitar]
IN MEMORY OF MY MATES,

28:12.350 --> 28:14.750
RIP AND HIGHWAY HARRY.

28:14.790 --> 28:15.984
[strums guitar]

28:16.020 --> 28:17.089
- ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.121
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST, LIPPS.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.388
[strums guitar]

28:19.430 --> 28:23.969
[whistling]

28:24.000 --> 28:27.128
- I WAS SPEAKING
ENGLISH, RIGHT?

28:27.170 --> 28:32.130
- [continues whistling]

28:32.170 --> 28:34.968
* IT'S A LONG ROAD,
MY BROTHERS *

28:35.010 --> 28:38.776
* AND WE TRAVEL IT ALONE

28:38.810 --> 28:41.449
* TOGETHER WE RIDE FOREVER

28:41.480 --> 28:44.483
* FOREVER,
TO THE OTHER SIDE *

28:44.520 --> 28:46.249
* IT'S A LONG ROAD

28:46.290 --> 28:48.451
- WAIT A MINUTE--
SO HE'S RIDING SOLO

28:48.490 --> 28:49.650
TO THE OTHER SIDE OR--

28:49.690 --> 28:51.920
- I THINK HE STARTS OFF ALONE,
AND THEN HE JOINS HIS FRIENDS.

28:51.960 --> 28:52.858
I THINK.

28:52.890 --> 28:54.824
- THEY'RE WAITING FOR HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.

28:54.860 --> 28:57.420
- WELL, IT'S NOT CLEAR
WHO HE'S WITH.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.462
- * TOGETHER, ALONE, ALONE

28:59.500 --> 29:01.832
* ALONE, ALONE, ALONE

29:01.870 --> 29:03.189
* ALONE, ALONE, TOGETHER

29:03.240 --> 29:05.800
* AND TOGETHER, ALONE, ALONE
[chandelier rattling]

29:05.840 --> 29:08.434
* ALONE, ALONE,
ALONE, ALONE *

29:08.480 --> 29:11.040
- BILLY, MOVE!
- DON'T MOVE, BILLY.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.344
- * TOGETHER ALONE

29:16.080 --> 29:19.049
-AAH! AAH!

29:19.090 --> 29:20.819
- [groans]

29:24.890 --> 29:27.893
- OH. THAT IS QUITE A MESS.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.796
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON AROUND HERE, LIPPS,

29:34.840 --> 29:35.989
BUT DON'T GO THINKING
YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.860
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
OF EXPLAINING TO DO.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.161
- CAN I MAKE A PHONE CALL?

29:39.210 --> 29:40.336
- PHONE CALL? TO WHO?

29:40.370 --> 29:42.372
- I HAVE TO TALK TO MY SHRINK.

29:42.410 --> 29:44.549
IT WAS RIP WHO ACTUALLY
TURNED ME ON TO HER.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.571
SHE'S BEEN WORKING MIRACLES
FOR US.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.078
HELPING US TO GET BACK ALL
THE YEARS THAT WE LOST TO DRUGS

29:49.120 --> 29:52.908
AND LATE NIGHT GAMES
OF "CLOCK ME NOGGIN."

29:52.950 --> 29:55.510
- THAT'S A WHITE MAN'S GAME.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.357
- IT'S TRUE.
- PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, MAN.

29:57.390 --> 29:59.051
YOU CAN CALL YOUR QUACK
RIGHT AFTER I FIGURE OUT

29:59.090 --> 30:01.354
WHICH ONE OF THESE THREE'S
THE KILLER.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.231
[feminine voice shrieks]

30:12.070 --> 30:14.106
- O'HARA, COVER ME.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.339
[thunder booms]

30:17.380 --> 30:19.007
- CURT SMITH!
- WHAT?

30:19.050 --> 30:20.403
- THIS IS AWESOME.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:20.450 --> 30:22.179
- BILLY INVITED ME.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.573
- I'M PRODUCING HIS NEW ALBUM,

30:23.620 --> 30:25.281
CURT SMITH
DUETS WITH CURT SMITH.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.015
HOW ARE YOU, MATE?

30:27.050 --> 30:29.018
- WELL, BILLY, I'VE BEEN SHOT
IN THE DIAPHRAGM....

30:29.060 --> 30:30.516
[all gasp]

30:30.560 --> 30:33.051
AND I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
I WAS ALSO ATTACKED BY...

30:33.090 --> 30:34.421
AN ADULT PANTHER?

30:34.460 --> 30:36.519
- EMMA, SURE.
- DID YOU SAY "SHOT"?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.425
- THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE SHOT WE HEARD.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.926
- [groans]
- OH.

30:39.970 --> 30:40.994
- [gaSPS]
- OH.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.598
- ELEVATE HIM!
ELEVATE HIM!

30:42.640 --> 30:45.564
- HE--HE IS
DECEPTIVELY HEAW!

30:45.610 --> 30:47.601
[all grunting]

30:47.640 --> 30:49.369
- LET ME THROUGH.
LET ME THROUGH.

30:49.410 --> 30:51.571
- IT'S OKAY, CURT.
IT'S REALLY JUST A FLESH WOUND.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.168
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

30:53.210 --> 30:55.349
WHY DON'T--
WHY DON'T YOU SING US A SONG

30:55.380 --> 30:57.985
FROM YOUR NEW DUETS ALBUM?

30:58.020 --> 30:59.282
- ALL RIGHT.

30:59.320 --> 31:02.881
THE FIRST ONE IS
A SPECIAL VERSION OF BILLY BOY.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.626
- OH, BILLY BOY.
- SO I START...

31:04.660 --> 31:09.654
* WHERE HAVE YOU GONE,
BILLY BOY, BILLY BOY? *

31:09.700 --> 31:11.065
AND THEN I COME IN.

31:11.100 --> 31:13.159
* WHERE HAVE YOU GONE

31:13.200 --> 31:15.395
both:
* CHARMING BILLY?

31:15.440 --> 31:17.965
- IS YOUR NAME CURT SMITH?

31:18.010 --> 31:18.931
- [muffled]
NO, IT'S NOT.

31:18.970 --> 31:20.506
- THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS.

31:20.540 --> 31:23.008
IT'S SO SERIOUS.
IT'S VERY, VERY SERIOUS.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.974
I HAVE TO GET--
all: GO!

31:25.010 --> 31:26.238
- OKAY, YES, I WILL.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.009
- O'HARA, GET ON THE PHONE

31:28.050 --> 31:29.415
AND CALL THE PARAMEDICS.

31:29.450 --> 31:31.338
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU SAW WHO SHOT YOU?

31:31.390 --> 31:35.417
- I DID, YES.
THEY WERE GRIPPING AN ICE PICK.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.587
AND I SAW THE FACE
CLEAR AS DAY.

31:37.620 --> 31:40.088
IT WAS...

31:45.400 --> 31:50.167
- NO! NO!

31:50.200 --> 31:54.273
THE LEGEND THAT IS CURT SMITH
IS DEAD.

31:54.310 --> 31:58.144
- YOUR HAND IS
ON THE GENTLEMAN'S HEAD.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.670
- HE'S STILL ALIVE.
- OH, THANK GOD!

31:59.710 --> 32:01.018
- ALL RIGHT.

32:01.050 --> 32:03.518
ONE OF YOU IS THE KILLER.

32:03.550 --> 32:05.040
NOW FESS UP.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.059
- WHAT FATHER?
HE'S NEVER MET HIS FATHER.

32:19.300 --> 32:22.030
- THE KILLER
IS NOT IN THIS ROOM.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.334
- REALLY?

32:24.370 --> 32:28.101
- I'M SORRY.
THE KILLER IS IN THIS ROOM.

32:28.140 --> 32:30.529
- IS THE KILLER IN THIS ROOM
OR NOT--YES OR NO?

32:30.580 --> 32:32.104
- YES.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.344
- YES, THE KILLER
IS IN THIS ROOM,

32:33.380 --> 32:35.177
OR, YES, THE KILLER
IS NOT IN THIS ROOM?

32:35.220 --> 32:38.348
- [British accent] THE KILLER
IS LESLIE, THE GROUPIE.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.414
- [gaSPS]

32:39.450 --> 32:40.747
- THAT'S RIGHT.

32:40.790 --> 32:42.553
YOU HOPSCOTCHED
FROM BED TO BED

32:42.590 --> 32:44.524
WITH RICH ROCK STARS
BACK IN THE DAY,

32:44.560 --> 32:46.551
AND IT LED TO A PEA
IN YOUR POD.

32:46.590 --> 32:50.128
THE QUESTION IS,
WHO IS THE DADDY?

32:50.160 --> 32:52.196
WASN'T SO EASY TO FORCE
A PATERNITY TEST BACK THEN.

32:52.230 --> 32:55.495
SO YOU WERE LEFT TO RAISE
YOUR CHILD ALL BY YOURSELF.

32:55.540 --> 32:58.429
YEARS OF BITTERNESS
FUELED A VENGEFUL FIRE

32:58.470 --> 33:00.267
MADE FROM FLAMES,

33:00.310 --> 33:01.572
AND YOU CAME BACK HERE TONIGHT

33:01.610 --> 33:03.305
TO OFF ALL
THE POTENTIAL DADDIES,

33:03.340 --> 33:05.604
ONE BY ONE BY ONE
BY ONE BY ONE.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.278
I'M ALSO SENSING THAT YOU
LIFTED A FEW ITEMS

33:08.320 --> 33:11.141
WITH DNA ON THEM
THIS EVENING.

33:11.190 --> 33:14.580
-[gas
OHTs]

33:14.620 --> 33:18.158
- WHAT A BRILLIANT
YET MURDEROUS PLAN.

33:18.190 --> 33:21.796
COME BACK HERE, TAKE OUT
ALL THE POTENTIAL DADDIES,

33:21.830 --> 33:24.219
USE DNA TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THE REAL ONE WAS,

33:24.270 --> 33:26.625
AND THEN COLLECT MONEY
FROM THEIR ESTATE

33:26.670 --> 33:29.138
TO BETTER SUPPORT
YOUR CHILD.

33:29.170 --> 33:30.432
AH.

33:30.470 --> 33:32.461
- OKAY!
I TOOK ALL THE ITEMS.

33:32.510 --> 33:36.173
BUT IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE
I NEEDED SOME EXTRA CASH.

33:36.210 --> 33:39.145
I WAS GOING TO PUT THEM
ON eBAY.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.738
I WAS HIT HARD BY THE RECE--

33:40.780 --> 33:42.668
RECE--RE-R--

33:42.720 --> 33:43.744
all:
RECESSION!

33:43.780 --> 33:45.111
- YES.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.289
BUT I NEVER,
NEVER HURT ANYONE.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.255
AND I KNOW
WHO GERMAINE'S FATHER

33:50.290 --> 33:52.383
REALLY IS.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.794
[both gasp]

33:56.830 --> 33:58.092
- [gaSPS]

33:58.130 --> 34:02.089
FROM OUR ONE NIGHT OF PASSION.

34:02.140 --> 34:02.993
I REMEMBER IT SO CLEARLY.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.531
YOU WERE A VISION
IN YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT.

34:05.570 --> 34:08.403
- [giggIeS]
- AND ON THAT SAME NIGHT,

34:08.440 --> 34:10.806
MELINDA LANE WAS FOUND DEAD
IN THE GUEST ROOM.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.209
WE WERE SLEEPING WHEN I HEARD
BILLY SCREAMING FOR HELP.

34:15.250 --> 34:16.512
I RUSHED TO THE ROOM
WITH MARTIN,

34:16.550 --> 34:17.812
AND YOU STAYED BEHIND...
- YES.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.842
- IN A DEEP SLEEP
FROM ALL OF THE ALCOHOL,

34:20.890 --> 34:23.688
QUAALUDES, AND CLIZBY.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.551
- OH, I OBSESSED OVER

34:25.590 --> 34:27.729
WHETHER TO TELL YOU
ABOUT GERMAIN E,

34:27.760 --> 34:31.093
BECAUSE I WAS ONLY SLEEPING
WITH THE BUTLER.

34:31.130 --> 34:34.588
I WAS WORRIED
THEY WOULD FIRE YOU, CLIZBY.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.232
- WELL, SPENCER,
YOUR WHOLE LESLIE THEORY

34:36.270 --> 34:37.498
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HOLDING
WATER, NOW, DOES IT?

34:37.540 --> 34:39.235
- JUST, YOU KNOW,
FOR THE RECORD,

34:39.270 --> 34:42.774
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT LESLIE
AND I HAD SEX.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.801
- I DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH YOU, BILLY.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.704
AND I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH RIP.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.173
AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH HIGHWAY HARRY.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.517
[thunder booms,
electricity fizzles]

34:50.550 --> 34:52.142
[all gasp]

34:52.190 --> 34:55.489
- [slurring]
SHE'S RIGHT. WE NEVER DID IT.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.351
[all gasp]

34:57.390 --> 35:00.257
IT WAS--IT WAS LIKE
SHOOTING POOL WITH A ROPE.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.155
- FREEZE!

35:02.200 --> 35:03.428
[candy clinks]

35:05.870 --> 35:08.566
[thunder booms]

35:08.600 --> 35:14.129
- YOU PUT THAT GUN ON THE FLOOR
AND KICK IT OVER.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.330
- HARRY, MATE!
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

35:16.380 --> 35:17.631
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

35:17.680 --> 35:19.170
- I BACKED OOT,

35:19.210 --> 35:21.349
YOKE UP, EVERY BLONDE
WAS BLONDE.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.608
- YEAH?

35:22.650 --> 35:23.719
- POUND OF BUNS IN THE YARD.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.388
HOVERED TH'ZIRTOCKET BOOM.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.887
- HE BLACKED OUT, WOKE UP,

35:26.920 --> 35:29.616
EVERYONE WAS GONE,
FOUND A GUN IN THE YARD,

35:29.660 --> 35:31.252
AND THEN DISCOVERED
THE CHOCOLATE ROOM,

35:31.290 --> 35:33.724
AND THAT WAS IT.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.251
- YOU TELL ME WHERE THAT
CHOCOLATE ROOM IS RIGHT NOW,

35:36.300 --> 35:37.494
OR I WILL KILL YOU MYSELF.

35:37.530 --> 35:39.828
- I DON'T--STONE BLENDER.

35:39.870 --> 35:41.633
- WHAT?
- HE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

35:41.670 --> 35:45.731
- YOU SUMBITCH.

35:45.770 --> 35:48.830
- BUT THEN WHO HIT HARRY
ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.609
- OH, BE BOB.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.576
BIT ME WITH A BOT AND BALDY
TO GROOVE OUT OF HER BLAZEMINT.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.679
- HIS MUM HIT HIM ON THE BACK
OF THE HEAD WITH A POT

35:56.720 --> 35:59.280
AND TOLD HIM TO MOVE
OUT OF HER BASEMENT.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.719
- YOU LIVE
IN YOUR MOTHER'S BASEMENT?

36:00.750 --> 36:01.751
- DON'T JUDGE ME.

36:01.790 --> 36:03.189
- DON'T JUDGE ME!

36:03.220 --> 36:07.452
- OKAY, SO SOMEONE
IN THIS ROOM KILLED RIP,

36:07.490 --> 36:08.889
DRAGGED HIM TO THE FREEZER,

36:08.930 --> 36:10.727
DUMPED THE MURDER WEAPON
IN THE FRONT YARD,

36:10.760 --> 36:11.761
SHOT CURT SMITH,

36:11.800 --> 36:15.395
AND ORCHESTRATED
THE COLOSSAL-CHANDELIER TRAP?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.829
- SHE'S SUMMARIZING,
THE FEMALE DETECTIVE.

36:17.870 --> 36:19.963
SHE'S GIVING US A SUMMARY
OF THE NIGHT'S EVENTS.

36:20.010 --> 36:21.875
- MY POINT IS THAT PERHAPS
IT WASN'T

36:21.910 --> 36:23.878
ONE PERSON WHO COMMITTED
THE CRIMES.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.502
- OH.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.212
- ONE PERSON DIDN'T COMMIT
ALL THESE CRIMES.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.241
IT HAD TO BE
MORE THAN ONE PERSON.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.214
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
I JUST SAID THAT.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.683
- I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.314
HOW COULD ONE PERSON
HAVE PULLED ALL THIS OFF

36:36.360 --> 36:38.954
WITHOUT AN ACCOMPLICE?
- VERY INTERESTING.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.254
WELL, LASSIE, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE PUT JULIET'S THEORY

36:41.300 --> 36:43.256
TO THE TEST?
- THANK YOU, SHAWN.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.562
[slap]
WHOO!

36:50.600 --> 36:51.931
- PERHAPS IT WAS RIP

36:51.970 --> 36:53.961
WHO KILLED MELINDA
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.501
- APPARENTLY RIP AND I GOT
INTO A HUGE BRAWL

36:56.540 --> 36:58.371
YEARS AGO
OVER MELINDA LANE.

36:58.410 --> 36:59.946
- AFTER ALL, SHE WAS TOYING

36:59.980 --> 37:01.948
WITH BOTH BILLY'S HEART
AND HARRY'S HEART.

37:01.980 --> 37:04.244
SHE WAS A CANCER
TO THE BAND.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.282
RIP WOULDN'T ALLOW IT,
SO HE KILLED HER.

37:09.990 --> 37:11.958
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
OW!

37:11.990 --> 37:13.651
- AND RIP'S MIND
WAS SUCH MUSH,

37:13.690 --> 37:15.453
HE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER
COMMITTING THE MURDERS.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.797
BUT THEN,
HE STARTED SEEING A SHRINK,

37:16.830 --> 37:17.649
AND ALL THE LOST MEMORIES
CAME BACK,

37:17.700 --> 37:19.668
INCLUDING THE MURDER
OF MELINDA LANE.

37:19.700 --> 37:20.860
- RIDDLED WITH GUILT,

37:20.900 --> 37:22.993
HE CONFESSED TO BILLY
WHAT HE'D DONE.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.962
- AFTER FIVE YEARS IN PRISON
FOR A MURDER

37:25.010 --> 37:26.432
YOU DIDN'T COMMIT,
YOU SNAPPED.

37:26.470 --> 37:28.631
- AND YOU PICKED UP
AN ICE PICK,

37:28.680 --> 37:30.739
AND YOU CHASED HIM
THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE!

37:30.780 --> 37:33.647
[screaming]

37:33.680 --> 37:37.878
[screaming continues]

37:37.920 --> 37:39.387
AND YOU CAUGHT HIM,
AND YOU PLUNGED THE ICE PICK

37:39.420 --> 37:40.887
INTO HIS BACK, KILLING HIM.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.452
[imitates stabbing sounds]

37:48.500 --> 37:49.728
[sighs]

37:49.760 --> 37:51.864
AND THEN YOU ALMOST THREW UP,

37:51.900 --> 37:53.561
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.864
AND YOU BENT DOWN
AND YOU GRABBED HIS WARM,

37:55.900 --> 37:59.904
THICK,
HEAVILY TATTOOED ARMS

37:59.940 --> 38:03.569
AND BEGAN DRAGGING
HIS LIFELESS CORPSE.

38:03.610 --> 38:04.838
[grunts]

38:04.880 --> 38:07.576
YOU DRAGGED RIP'S BODY
THROUGH THE KITCHEN

38:07.610 --> 38:09.976
AND HID HIM IN THE FREEZER.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.614
[grunts]

38:12.650 --> 38:14.459
- BUT THEN I CAME STRUTTING
THROUGH THE DOOR,

38:14.490 --> 38:15.855
AND, STRICKEN WITH PANIC,

38:15.890 --> 38:16.959
YOU HAD TO GET RID
OF THE MURDER WEAPON.

38:16.990 --> 38:20.426
- INDEED!
TO THE PORTE COCHERE.

38:23.830 --> 38:27.493
AND SO YOU SNUCK INTO THE YARD
TO DISPOSE OF THE ICE PICK.

38:27.530 --> 38:28.895
- WHERE YOU SAW CURT SMITH.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.430
- WHAT ARE YOU--

38:30.470 --> 38:33.837
[gunshot]
[groans]

38:33.870 --> 38:36.737
- AND YOU SHOT
THE LEGENDARY ROCK ICON DEAD.

38:36.780 --> 38:37.804
all:
HE'S NOT DEAD!

38:37.840 --> 38:39.501
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

38:39.550 --> 38:40.972
[panther snarling]

38:41.010 --> 38:43.877
[all scream]

38:47.890 --> 38:50.859
[breathing heavily]

38:50.890 --> 38:53.381
BOOM.

38:53.430 --> 38:56.524
- BUT THEN WHO TRIED
TO KILL BILLY

38:56.560 --> 38:59.028
WITH THAT BIG,
MONSTROUS CHANDELIER?

38:59.070 --> 39:01.368
both: * CHOCOLATE DANCE,
CHOCOLATE DANCE *

39:01.400 --> 39:06.064
* CHOCOLATE DANCE, YEAH!
IT'S AN ENTIRE ROOM *

39:06.110 --> 39:07.964
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,

39:08.010 --> 39:11.002
I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL CLARITY
ON THAT ONE, BURTON.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.042
- THAT'S A LOT OF NONSENSE.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.469
RIP DIDN'T KILL NOBODY.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.442
HE WAS IN THE ROOM
NEXT TO ME ALL NIGHT

39:17.480 --> 39:19.539
SNORING HIS ASS OFF.

39:19.590 --> 39:22.889
- WHICH MEANS I DIDN'T KILL RIP
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KILL MELINDA,

39:22.920 --> 39:24.751
WHICH MEANS
I WAS NEVER IN THE YARD

39:24.790 --> 39:26.929
DUMPING ANY MURDER WEAPON

39:26.960 --> 39:30.828
BECAUSE I DIDN'T MURDER ANYONE!

39:30.860 --> 39:32.896
EXCEPT FOR MELINDA LANE.

39:32.930 --> 39:36.161
I GUESS I STILL MURDERED HER.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.895
- I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.033
IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS MULTIPLE-KILLER THEORY

39:40.070 --> 39:41.833
ISN'T HOLDING MUCH WATER
AT THE MOMENT.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.575
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, BILLY.

39:43.610 --> 39:45.942
SO EVERYONE GET COMFY,

39:45.980 --> 39:47.402
'CAUSE I'M GONNA TELL YOU

39:47.450 --> 39:50.578
HOW THE REAL KILLER
PULLED THIS OFF.

39:50.620 --> 39:51.939
[thunder booms]

39:51.990 --> 39:52.945
[all gasp]

39:57.960 --> 40:00.053
- MELINDA LANE
WASN'T THE REAL MUSE

40:00.090 --> 40:02.058
BEHIND THE BAND
BACK IN THE DAY.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.829
THE REAL MUSE

40:03.860 --> 40:05.999
MAKES THE TASTIEST SNACKS
THIS SIDE OF THE PECOS

40:06.030 --> 40:07.861
AND ALSO HAS A GIFT
FOR WHISTLING

40:07.900 --> 40:09.868
UNDENIABLY CATCHY MELODIES.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.733
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CLIZBY?

40:12.770 --> 40:15.432
- [whistling a tune]

40:15.480 --> 40:17.903
- [whistling same tune]

40:17.940 --> 40:20.147
- YOU SEE, BILLY LIPPS
AND THE GUYS BEHIND HIM

40:20.180 --> 40:22.546
HAD BEEN STEALING YOUR TUNES
AND CASH FOR YEARS,

40:22.580 --> 40:27.017
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT
IS A $25 WATCH?

40:27.050 --> 40:27.914
MELINDA KEPT TAKING
ALL THE CREDIT

40:27.950 --> 40:29.656
WITH THE PRESS FOR BEING
THE INSPIRATION

40:29.690 --> 40:31.180
BEHIND ALL THE BAND'S
HIT SONGS,

40:31.220 --> 40:33.529
AND ONE DAY, YOU LOOKED
IN THE MIRROR AND SAID,

40:33.560 --> 40:37.929
"MAN, I'M DONE
WITH THESE DAPSHATS."

40:37.960 --> 40:39.029
YOU SNUCK INTO THE ROOM

40:39.070 --> 40:42.665
MELINDA WAS SLEEPING,
AND YOU SMOTHERED HER GOOD.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.702
- THAT'S CRAZY, MAN.
- IS IT?

40:44.740 --> 40:47.664
YEARS LATER, RIP,
AFTER INTENSIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY,

40:47.710 --> 40:48.904
STARTED FILLING IN THE BLANKS.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.498
HE REALIZED IT WAS YOU
WHO KILLED MELINDA.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.872
CAME HERE TO CONFRONT YOU.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.172
YOU ICE-PICKED HIM

40:54.210 --> 40:55.609
AND WERE LOOKING
FOR A BETTER HIDING PLACE

40:55.650 --> 40:56.912
FOR YOUR MURDER WEAPON

40:56.950 --> 40:59.009
WHEN CURT SMITH,
LEGEND THAT HE IS,

40:59.050 --> 41:03.111
FOUND HIMSELF IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.718
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

41:04.760 --> 41:05.988
all:
HE'S NOT DEAD.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.055
- OF COURSE
IT WAS YOU, CLIZBY,

41:08.090 --> 41:10.888
WHO LOOSENED THE SCREWS
ON THE GINORMOUS CHANDELIER,

41:10.930 --> 41:12.898
KNOWING FULL WELL THAT
IT WAS BILLY'S MAGIC SPOT,

41:12.930 --> 41:14.591
AND IT WAS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

41:14.640 --> 41:18.667
BEFORE IT FELL AND CRUSHED
THAT PASTY, THIEVING ASS.

41:18.710 --> 41:21.804
- CLIZBY!
SAY IT ISN'T SO.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.876
I ONLY HAVE ONE BLACK FRIEND.
IT'S YOU.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.207
AND I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE TIME

41:25.250 --> 41:27.138
OR RESOURCES
TO FIND A REPLACEMENT.

41:27.180 --> 41:30.217
HELLO.
WHO ARE YOU?

41:30.250 --> 41:31.911
- FINE.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.212
IT WAS ME.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.979
[all gasp]

41:35.020 --> 41:38.751
THOSE CATS HAVE BEEN STEALING
FROM ME FOR YEARS.

41:39.990 --> 41:42.550
TIME TO GO TO JAIL...

41:42.600 --> 41:43.999
[lisps]
CLIZBY.

41:44.030 --> 41:45.622
STUPID NAME.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.991
[slap]
- OOH!

41:48.030 --> 41:49.668
- DON'T WORRY, CURT.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.031
WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH YOU
THE WHOLE WAY, MATE.

41:51.070 --> 41:52.560
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE, CURT.

41:52.610 --> 41:53.963
JUST A FLESH WOUND, BABY.

41:54.010 --> 41:55.568
BE GOOD AS NEW IN NO TIME.
- YOU'RE A TROOPER.

41:55.610 --> 41:56.838
- CURT SMITH
SINGS WITH CURT SMITH.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.075
[panther snarling]

41:59.110 --> 42:00.702
- OH, GOD, NO!

42:00.750 --> 42:04.049
[panther snarling]

42:04.080 --> 42:06.548
- SOMEBODY SHOULD PROBABLY CALL
ANIMAL CONTROL, RIGHT?

42:06.590 --> 42:07.648
all: YES!

42:07.690 --> 42:09.009
- GREAT.
[clears throat]

42:09.060 --> 42:10.812
NOW...

42:10.860 --> 42:11.849
GUS AND I
ARE GOING TO GO HOME

42:11.890 --> 42:13.585
AND MAKE LOVE TO OUR WIVES.

42:13.630 --> 42:17.191
- WE'RE NOT MARRIED, SHAWN.

42:21.900 --> 42:24.937
- * YOU'RE INVITED,
LUCKY YOU *

42:24.970 --> 42:28.235
* T TO A PARTY,
WHOOP-P-DE-DO *

42:28.270 --> 42:31.330

* WHO'S'S YOUR HOST?
I WIWISH I KNEW *

42:34.720 --> 42:37.575
* YOU'RE INVITED

42:37.620 --> 42:42.717

42:42.760 --> 42:46.127
* YOU HAVE A A PLUS-ONE
