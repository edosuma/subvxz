WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.200
Family.

00:04.360 --> 00:08.239
Family, that's a weakness.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.560
Yours, mine.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.079
And that's why it broke my heart.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.119
She knew too.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.520
Out there, out in the street.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.360
Seeing the pain between you.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.040
Seeing how old it was,
pain like that.

00:32.760 --> 00:35.559
That only comes from family,

00:35.560 --> 00:38.160
and only family
can take it from you.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.119
And you two weren't ready
to take it from each other.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.519
So you found a way to make it worse.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.880
And it made me think about pain...

00:50.120 --> 00:51.480
..and about family...

00:52.960 --> 00:55.799
..and about the parts of
this city that specialise in

00:55.800 --> 00:57.360
putting the two together...

01:00.560 --> 01:04.359
..betrayal and regret,

01:04.360 --> 01:06.760
and how quickly one
follows the other.

01:08.200 --> 01:13.199
I thought about all the steps taken
in this city by those marked souls

01:13.200 --> 01:18.319
and how their feet have
worn sorrow into our streets.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.440
And that's why...

01:20.680 --> 01:23.039
..that's why it broke my heart.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.119
Seeing you two, out there,

01:27.120 --> 01:28.640
out on the street.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.560
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I got over it.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.320
Why were you there?

01:49.920 --> 01:51.120
Was Roy there?

01:52.160 --> 01:53.440
Why was Roy there?

02:02.720 --> 02:05.359
You... Nice to see you, Max.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.239
You and them?
You two can get to that,

02:07.240 --> 02:10.759
but it's cold and
I want to go to bed, so,

02:10.760 --> 02:12.640
tell me what you've done.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.479
Or I'll get those men over there
to kill you and then your brother.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.159
Sorry? And maybe
the other way around,

02:19.160 --> 02:22.479
I've not worked out the order yet.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.239
What is this? What did
they tell you it was, Jake?

02:26.240 --> 02:29.119
What master plan that they
come up with to dupe you?

02:29.120 --> 02:32.119
I got a call to say that you were
in hospital, that you were dying.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.999
HE LAUGHS
Jesus Christ.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.119
It was Lothian police,

02:35.120 --> 02:37.319
you don't question a phone
call from Lothian police.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.879
Two years gone, and
you just roll back in

02:39.880 --> 02:41.839
on a fucking wave of
stupid, ain't you?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.919
That's out of order!
I didn't have to come.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.279
That's kind of my point.
I'm doing well over there, Max.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.879
I've got Angie,
I've got a whole life,

02:47.880 --> 02:50.119
and then I got a call to say
my brother's been hit by a bus.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.319
Who gets hit by a bus?!

02:51.320 --> 02:54.799
And I came without moment's thought,
without a moment's hesitation,

02:54.800 --> 02:58.040
so, so, just show me
some respect or I'm walking!

02:59.400 --> 03:01.480
Has he always been so dramatic?

03:03.320 --> 03:04.520
Sit down, Jake.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.639
You're not here to help me.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.560
You're here to help them.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.400
I just haven't worked out how yet.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It was my idea, not hers.

03:28.680 --> 03:33.959
Let's try and make some money
to ease my post custodial life.

03:33.960 --> 03:38.360
I put the land in her name,
and she was going to pay me off.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.999
I can tell you how I did it,
and I...and only I

03:44.000 --> 03:46.239
can tell you how to fix it.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.919
You turned our daughter against us,
and you think you can fix it?

03:49.920 --> 03:51.759
Their daughter?
I've taken precautions.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.480
That is mental!
If something happens to me...

03:55.640 --> 03:58.639
..then something happens to Roy,

03:58.640 --> 04:01.159
Erin and perhaps yourself,

04:01.160 --> 04:03.640
seeing as you're so hands on.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.400
We take precautions too, son.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.640
We tell a story with
things like this.

04:12.680 --> 04:18.959
A story that protects us
from you and your precautions.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.599
I kept quiet when I was arrested.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.839
We're looking into
how quiet you kept.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.680
Good. But none of that saves you.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.880
What saves you for now...

04:34.280 --> 04:36.799
..is lying for her,

04:36.800 --> 04:38.800
that it wasn't her idea.

04:40.280 --> 04:46.119
You'll go to Erin today and
see what we tell you to see.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.319
And then?

04:47.320 --> 04:49.720
Be grateful that
there is "and then".

05:06.200 --> 05:09.399
Sending me down was good for you?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.199
It's good for Roy?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.439
What, was it money?

05:12.440 --> 05:14.879
I was going to do it anyway.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.079
Thought I might as
well get paid for it,

05:17.080 --> 05:19.559
seeing as how you were going
to leave me with nothing,

05:19.560 --> 05:22.719
seeing as though you were
going to do the same to me.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.479
And, yeah, even though you'd
do that to me in a heartbeat,

05:26.480 --> 05:28.559
just sat there,

05:28.560 --> 05:30.200
inside me, every day.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.559
Why do I feel things
that you don't, Max?

05:34.560 --> 05:37.519
Why do I suffer for doing things
that you do without looking back?

05:37.520 --> 05:40.719
Because you never
heard the damage I did!

05:40.720 --> 05:43.400
The early stuff,
the stuff that never goes away!

05:51.360 --> 05:53.639
You should come back with me.

05:53.640 --> 05:57.279
Not in the market for
a holiday right now.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.359
I used Roy's money to buy a bar.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.400
Pub?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.479
Get away from Edinburgh, Max,

06:05.480 --> 06:07.439
away from the damage,

06:07.440 --> 06:09.560
that's the answer to
your problems...

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
..to your flaws, to you.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.120
But it's there...

06:17.400 --> 06:18.520
..in Chicago...

06:20.880 --> 06:22.480
..just waiting on you.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.960
You know, Jake...

06:27.320 --> 06:29.400
..before you came along,
things were OK.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.559
I mean, they were shit,
but they were OK.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.119
Dad came home for the pub singing
Frankie Miller every night,

06:36.120 --> 06:38.399
three sheets to the wind,
and as happy as I can get, yeah?

06:38.400 --> 06:41.759
And Mum was only half mad.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.999
But then you came along...

06:45.000 --> 06:47.960
..and Dad didn't sing any more.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.240
And Mum...

06:54.160 --> 06:56.280
..well, you know
what happened to Mum.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.200
It's you.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.840
You're the problem.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.120
You always were.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.040
Bye, Jake.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.080
I didn't deserve it.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.519
They're gonna let me off the hook,

07:37.520 --> 07:41.879
and face my own
stupidity at trusting Max...

07:41.880 --> 07:43.360
..at trusting anyone.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.360
Did you know he was
working with you lot?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.680
Yes.
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

07:56.400 --> 07:57.880
HE SCOFFS

08:00.400 --> 08:04.679
So the thing with you and me,
was that... That was real, which...

08:04.680 --> 08:06.119
..was a complication.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.560
Thanks for coming.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.800
I'll take it from here.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.679
A couple of years ago,

08:21.680 --> 08:23.679
I was the key witness
against a joy rider

08:23.680 --> 08:26.240
who ran over a woman in Craigmillar.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.399
I never made it to court.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.400
I was drunk, or hung over,
or somewhere between the two.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.879
He got off.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.320
They called a mistrial.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.799
I managed to hide it from
everyone except my partner.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.279
And he didn't report me,
he just sat on it

08:52.280 --> 08:56.119
and used it to get the
job that I should've got.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.599
But now I've got a
chance to take him down,

08:58.600 --> 09:01.839
and by taking him down,
we take Roy Lynch down,

09:01.840 --> 09:05.080
and by taking Roy Lynch down,
we take Max down.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.680
And then you and me...

09:10.120 --> 09:12.320
..that won't be a
complication any more.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.320
So why don't you tell me what
you know about Max and Rory Lynch?

09:26.080 --> 09:28.800
MUSIC: Theme of Rome by
Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi

09:45.440 --> 09:47.679
It's not about peaking at his file.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.639
I want every bit of paper in that
place with his name on it,

09:50.640 --> 09:52.079
every interaction.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.879
I want to know if
anyone would come looking

09:53.880 --> 09:55.759
if they didn't hear from Max again.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.679
You can't ask me to do that.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.359
It would raise flags.
It would be suicide.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.759
By tonight.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.159
CALL ENDS

10:04.160 --> 10:05.640
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

10:08.800 --> 10:10.039
So, it's her?

10:10.040 --> 10:15.559
Yeah, she has summoned
me to see you and confess all.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.039
Act shocked.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.679
She's been behind
all everything they've done.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.080
Now we've flushed her out...

10:23.840 --> 10:25.799
..so they can go down together.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.999
But they know what you're doing.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.399
And I know what they're doing.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.920
So it's a race.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.239
You see, you can crack an egg on
a rock, and it'll fry right there,

10:40.240 --> 10:41.959
just from the sun.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.800
Death Valley,
that's where I'd start.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.879
Then I'd have a wee
wander all over the West,

10:48.880 --> 10:51.239
the Old West, you know,

10:51.240 --> 10:54.400
the Great Plains,
the Rockies, the Alamo.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.319
That's all I've ever wanted to do.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.760
And I've never done it. Why is that?

11:01.880 --> 11:03.199
Hard to say.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.599
Maybe it's because I want
to keep it as a dream...

11:06.600 --> 11:08.000
..an escape.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.959
I want to go home.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.000
Home?

11:14.880 --> 11:16.279
You've been over there two years,

11:16.280 --> 11:18.119
and you sell
Edinburgh down the river?

11:18.120 --> 11:20.199
I want to go, Roy.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.520
And you shall.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.680
Just one wee favour first.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.999
Here's the thing
about being a puppet,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.599
the world doesn't see the strings,

11:34.600 --> 11:38.399
so you can cut them whenever you
want and the world won't know.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.640
On paper, to the world...

11:41.680 --> 11:43.759
..you're Phoenix.

11:43.760 --> 11:47.079
This is a chance to
make that a reality.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.679
Phoenix doesn't own the land.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.559
That's why I'm here to sell it
to you at half the market value.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.239
Which you could raise in a day.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.759
You don't own the land either.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.599
It's owned by the
Lynch Family Trust,

11:59.600 --> 12:02.519
in which the controlling
share is owned by Erin,

12:02.520 --> 12:06.039
over whom I have power of attorney.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.040
So here I am...selling
you the land.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.599
Does Roy know? No.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.360
When he does, we'll be in prison.

12:17.520 --> 12:21.799
You want to be in there,
too, or out here and rich?

12:21.800 --> 12:23.679
It's Roy Lynch. Yeah,
well, come tomorrow,

12:23.680 --> 12:25.440
that won't mean so much.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.359
This is a good deal at
the best of times.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.639
Right now, where you are...

12:32.640 --> 12:34.600
..this is a miracle.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.280
So you've got the church?

12:40.840 --> 12:43.000
Yeah, we've got the church.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.839
It's not a good time, son.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.039
I'm about to do my
loaves and fishes act.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.519
I should've known.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.799
Dirty money in the development,
I should've worked it out.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.639
Spaghetti hoops.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.639
If you ever find yourself
running a food bank in Leith,

13:16.640 --> 13:18.359
it's all spaghetti hoops.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.439
If I ever find myself
running a food bank in Leith,

13:20.440 --> 13:22.439
spaghetti hoops will be
the least of my worries.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.279
Why haven't you sold it yet?

13:24.280 --> 13:27.559
I've already given them everything.
It's not having this place.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.479
Roy's property
holdings are being sold.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.079
This place needs to be apart of it.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.120
And I'm running out of patience.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.919
You know, son,

13:37.920 --> 13:40.319
whoever told you you were scary,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.800
I think they might've been
having a wee bit of fun.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.360
SHARPLY: Fuck.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.919
So how have you been?

13:49.920 --> 13:51.519
Oh, I see it all, Jake.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.839
Look, Kenny, tomorrow...

13:52.840 --> 13:55.079
It's on his desk.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.079
Max said you might be in,
with company.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.920
He's left you something.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.720
A memento, he called it.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.999
Don't come here tomorrow.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.320
Wait, what are you doing?

14:24.880 --> 14:26.240
What have you done?

14:27.920 --> 14:32.079
You told me once that Max shouldn't
get away with being who he is.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.719
And I didn't let him get
away with it, but you did.

14:35.720 --> 14:39.199
And it looks like you've given
him another chance for luck.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.199
And I can't imagine that
gone very well, either.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.760
This is Max's doing.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.920
It's not mine, it's not yours.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.040
I don't want it to end like this,
but it's the only way it can.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.920
Do not come here tomorrow.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.599
That poor wee brother.

15:14.600 --> 15:19.559
All that way for Max to blame him
for everything under the sun.

15:19.560 --> 15:24.159
When people look for blame,
they don't tend to look far.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.719
Have we heard from
lease Billy Graeme?

15:26.720 --> 15:27.960
No.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.160
I'll speak to him. My turn.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.320
DOORBELL RINGS

15:40.840 --> 15:42.040
I'll get it.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.400
You and I...

15:49.840 --> 15:53.119
..it wasn't all you thought it was.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.959
We weren't working together.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.119
I was taking it all for myself,

15:58.120 --> 16:01.599
which has now been...rectified.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.439
You were my escape.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.719
You were my lifeboat.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.399
With respect, you
don't need a lifeboat,

16:06.400 --> 16:08.359
you got big house and a
father with lots of money,

16:08.360 --> 16:09.679
that has to go somewhere.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.319
Careful.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.559
Being his daughter
doesn't bring many benefits,

16:13.560 --> 16:16.239
but one is not having other men
speak to me like that.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.920
PHONE RINGS

16:24.200 --> 16:26.879
You best be off down the road, son.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.360
RINGING CONTINUES

16:30.280 --> 16:31.479
Yes?

16:31.480 --> 16:32.839
He's out on licence.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.999
They took it out of the file,
but I found the original.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.639
Which means? Which means he's
working with someone here,

16:37.640 --> 16:39.119
and if they can
take it out the file,

16:39.120 --> 16:41.919
then I imagine it's undercover.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.959
I imagine it's her.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.159
Bring me the file.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.320
Well that's not going to be easy.
CALL ENDS

16:50.520 --> 16:52.759
He wants the file.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.000
Good.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.920
I'm sorry, Roy, uh...

17:00.960 --> 17:03.199
I was just trying to
get her back, you know?

17:03.200 --> 17:04.759
I understand.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.079
Divide and conquer.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.399
But in the end, you
just pushed her back to us.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.679
That helps you.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.360
You took me on, and
you only made my life better.

17:16.960 --> 17:21.119
And what else helps
you is that you're right.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.000
I need you for Phoenix.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.120
I agree.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.479
I'll come to your office tomorrow.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.799
Tell your thirsty friend
to make himself scarce,

17:31.800 --> 17:34.160
and we'll sort something out.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.560
Thanks, Roy.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.279
Max took me to see them,

17:44.280 --> 17:46.999
in the Playhouse.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.599
July 23rd, 1985.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.080
It was my first gig.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.079
People say that was
the day that punk died,

17:54.080 --> 17:55.840
The Clash signing to CBS.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.840
And then they went away and made the
greatest punk record of all time.

18:02.720 --> 18:08.000
I remember Max telling me that
this record was an act of revenge.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.720
That appealed to Max.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.880
There's something else.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.879
Your father and I...

18:21.880 --> 18:26.079
This is one of the blocks
of flats in the development.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.159
We've taken the top one.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.839
We're going to see
out our days together.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.879
Back in Leith. Where it all began.

18:32.880 --> 18:37.679
I might even start the
physiotherapy again on my legs.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.040
You never know.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.760
The blood...

18:44.040 --> 18:45.440
..on Christmas Eve.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.759
You weren't washing
it from Dad's hands,

18:48.760 --> 18:51.679
he was washing it from yours.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.600
We hit a deer. No lies.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.280
No more.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.999
Your father was...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.119
..mistreated...

19:06.120 --> 19:08.880
..by a man when he was a wee boy.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.440
A teacher.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.520
So I killed that man.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.880
What did he do to you?

19:27.720 --> 19:30.440
If he was here now,
I'd kill him again.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.679
So what happened...to the car?

19:38.680 --> 19:40.639
What happened to you?
It wasn't Dad's fault.

19:40.640 --> 19:44.159
Your father sacrificed his
relationship with you

19:44.160 --> 19:47.999
to protect your
relationship with me.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.479
That's the man he is.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.919
Well, you didn't let me know that.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.959
It was my decision.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.839
You stole him from me
to keep me for yourself.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.520
It was my decision.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.840
The chair...

20:02.480 --> 20:04.040
..you hide behind it.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.720
Just like you hide behind him.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.520
Think less of me and more of him.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.359
This is a great day!

20:19.360 --> 20:21.679
They wanted to wait. A great day!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.519
Well, I suppose these
things are relative.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.039
We've got to serve these
another in Nathaniel's karate.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.599
You wouldn't really be serving them.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.639
Probably say something
about being for the chop,

20:29.640 --> 20:31.599
like a punch sort of thing. Christ.
SHE CHUCKLES

20:31.600 --> 20:33.039
Still haven't worked that bit out.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.119
Well, you don't really
need to involve me in the...

20:35.120 --> 20:36.999
Hug for Nathaniel,
shake hands with Sensei,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.439
then leave with dignity.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.559
Glad to be of service.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.479
You have really
turned this around for me.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.880
That's the present.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.680
You're a pair of angels, lads.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.279
A pair of angels.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.400
DOOR OPENS

20:54.000 --> 20:55.599
DOOR CLOSES

20:55.600 --> 20:58.200
Any message from Jake?

20:59.320 --> 21:03.919
Uh, no, he just popped in to say
hello, like you said he would.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.240
OK.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.799
I need the details of the
account you set up for me.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.399
The one with Roy's money in it.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.759
Why?

21:16.760 --> 21:19.759
Proof of funds for a wee mortgage.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.639
I've seen a flat,
I mean, it's not flash, but...

21:22.640 --> 21:24.559
..it's no Pilton.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.800
Good for you.

21:32.640 --> 21:33.920
It's all there.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.839
You know, Kenny,

21:40.840 --> 21:43.759
spending all this time in Leith,

21:43.760 --> 21:46.040
I've got awful nostalgic.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.399
It's made me think about the past...

21:50.400 --> 21:53.000
..about the damage I've done.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.239
And I'm sorry about that.

21:57.240 --> 22:02.720
I also wanted to tell
you that this is yours.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.560
I put the business in your name.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.480
Time for you to start
building your empire.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.679
A good living, a good life.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.999
And where would you be?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.840
I'll be in tomorrow, clear my desk.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.680
We'll talk then.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.479
People think I'm stupid, Max,

22:27.480 --> 22:29.080
for the chances I've given you.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.559
But they don't know that when I
said I wanted to go to university,

22:36.560 --> 22:40.119
my old man said, "No, no, that
wasn't a place for people like us."

22:40.120 --> 22:43.319
But then my mum said,
"Oh, hold on now,

22:43.320 --> 22:46.279
"what about that Max McCall
from Lochend Road,

22:46.280 --> 22:48.039
"whose Dad ran for
the hills and left them

22:48.040 --> 22:49.479
"with a sick mum and a wee brother?

22:49.480 --> 22:52.519
"He went to the university,
and now, Max McCall

22:52.520 --> 22:56.279
"is working uptown and drives a
Merc and got his mum a time-share

22:56.280 --> 22:57.639
"in Aviemore for Christmas."

22:57.640 --> 23:00.199
And that got my dad interested,
hearing about the time-share,

23:00.200 --> 23:02.199
cos he'd always wanted one of them.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.679
He said that with a time-share,

23:03.680 --> 23:05.559
you knew you were having
a holiday every year,

23:05.560 --> 23:08.839
whether you're working or not.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.680
So I went to university.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.640
Because of you.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.800
And I lasted a month...

23:19.240 --> 23:20.480
..cos I wasn't you.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.759
When you looked at those people,
you thought, "Aye, that'll do me."

23:25.760 --> 23:29.159
I looked at them like they
were from the fucking moon!

23:29.160 --> 23:33.079
They did the same to me,
and that was that.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.239
One month.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.280
No time-share for us.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.079
You came from where I came from.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.760
But you weren't scared.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.920
I don't know how you do that.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.120
And that's why I've
given you so many chances.

24:00.360 --> 24:03.320
I was scared, Kenny.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.240
I still am.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.160
And I'll see you tomorrow.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.240
See you tomorrow.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.960
Sorry, I'm early.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.639
Uh, this is Max.

24:29.640 --> 24:30.879
This is Yvonne.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.960
Max McCall. Nice to meet you.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.839
You got a good one here.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.280
Yeah, yeah, I do.

24:39.360 --> 24:43.560
RADIO: 10-4, Control. Hutchinson,
can you please do a PNC check?

24:48.720 --> 24:50.240
Look after him.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.400
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

25:18.200 --> 25:19.560
Oh, here he is!

25:33.880 --> 25:37.039
You may have dropped me a wee
bit closer to departures.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.120
No.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.880
What's this? A story.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.319
No, no, wait, wait.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.119
Jesus Christ!

25:48.120 --> 25:50.959
That's an artery! Is that an artery?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.159
It feels like an artery.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.520
I heard you were dramatic.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.599
I'm glad you like
it over there, son,

25:56.600 --> 25:58.760
cos you can't come back now.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.200
Again?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.999
Anyone would think
you want to convert,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.920
to free yourself from
the yoke of paupery.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.879
Do you know...

26:38.880 --> 26:41.119
..why I became a lawyer?

26:41.120 --> 26:43.039
Because you're a prick?

26:43.040 --> 26:44.959
HE CHUCKLES DRYLY

26:44.960 --> 26:46.840
That's the short answer.

26:48.760 --> 26:51.720
The long one is that I wanted
the world to be black and white.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.400
I came from chaos.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.520
So, I wanted rules...

27:01.640 --> 27:02.680
..clarity.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.399
But the more I looked for the black
and white, the more I found...

27:07.400 --> 27:08.800
..grey...

27:09.960 --> 27:13.320
..and the more I found
myself in the grey.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.640
Because that's where the action is.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.560
The good stuff.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.719
The stuff that makes
life feel like it's...

27:23.720 --> 27:25.519
..got a wee bit of energy,

27:25.520 --> 27:27.400
surprise and skill.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.560
No man can stare at
the grey, well, forever.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.720
Life's too long.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.200
And then I look at you...

27:43.560 --> 27:47.519
..and I see a man
doing everything he can

27:47.520 --> 27:51.160
to put time and distance
between himself and the grey.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.080
And whatever you did
when you were in there...

27:58.120 --> 28:00.839
..before you...

28:00.840 --> 28:02.880
..spread your celestial wings.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.559
When you were still down here
in the gutter,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.160
with the rest of us.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.480
Kenny told me about you once.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.480
A dry drunk without
a pot to piss in.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.440
And a kid that doesn't even
know you exist.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.879
I would suggest caution

28:30.880 --> 28:33.560
on relying on Kenny for clarity.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.679
Stay.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.120
What for?

28:44.640 --> 28:45.960
Revelation.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.720
You ever been up to the
Church Offices in George Street?

28:54.520 --> 28:56.039
Thankfully not.

28:56.040 --> 29:00.439
It's full of lots of clever folk
in suits.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.320
They nearly fell over themselves
to take your offer.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.960
Said this church was "low impact".

29:12.280 --> 29:15.319
Which hurt a little,
but there you go.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.039
Finishing up on Sunday.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.600
Telling the flock.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.399
It's yours, Roy.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.720
It's all done.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.960
So why the silence?

29:31.080 --> 29:32.480
I wanted to see you.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.679
You think I do this job
because of the guilt

29:36.680 --> 29:38.360
of what we did to that man?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.120
And you're wrong.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.520
It's just the final instalment.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.479
I was already carrying a heavy load.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.760
An old load.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.679
I thought doing this might...

29:56.680 --> 29:58.000
..make it lighter.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.480
But it just got heavier.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.920
I mean, how could it not?

30:14.880 --> 30:16.800
After 39 years.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.519
Why are you telling me?

30:41.520 --> 30:44.120
Now we've both lost everything.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.480
DOOR CLOSES

31:24.560 --> 31:26.040
Use it kindly.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.680
We both know how you want me
to use it.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.600
What will you do when
they knock it down?

31:35.800 --> 31:37.520
I'll find a way to serve.

31:41.960 --> 31:45.240
If I gave you some money...

31:46.840 --> 31:52.799
..erm, could you use it around here
to help, you know,

31:52.800 --> 31:54.840
sad kids, that kind of thing?

31:57.360 --> 31:58.679
Yes.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.800
Right, well, we'll do that, then.

32:02.880 --> 32:06.040
Let us bring light to those who...
No, thanks.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.440
..to those who live in darkness.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.200
Roy?

32:34.400 --> 32:36.160
I don't think it'll work.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.480
The flat, the...

32:43.400 --> 32:44.720
Being together.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.800
I think you should stay here.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.439
Do you want to talk about it?

32:54.440 --> 32:55.480
No.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.040
Erin?

33:03.800 --> 33:05.160
After I'm gone.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.000
I had no good options.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.560
You stay here, love.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.000
They know you here.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.800
FRONT DOOR OPENS

33:42.440 --> 33:44.160
DOOR CLOSES

33:54.520 --> 33:56.399
Erin...

33:56.400 --> 33:57.800
Mum.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.000
She confessed.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.200
That's great.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.520
Can I have the recording?

34:12.440 --> 34:13.640
I deleted it.

34:16.200 --> 34:19.159
They talk about other stuff as well,
things about my dad that other

34:19.160 --> 34:20.439
people don't need to know.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.439
I told you what I wanted,
what I needed.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.799
He doesn't deserve to end
his life in prison,

34:24.800 --> 34:26.199
not the way it started.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.319
The land is sold.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.559
Fine.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.879
It hurts her as much as it hurts
him, and she deserves it.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.319
The land is sold
and he's not in prison...

34:34.320 --> 34:36.919
Then you should leave Edinburgh.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.440
And take me with you.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.720
You...

34:48.360 --> 34:50.559
You've got...

34:50.560 --> 34:52.919
..more in this city than
you think you do.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.320
ERIN SIGHS

34:55.960 --> 34:58.679
I'm not saying it would
have to be...

34:58.680 --> 35:01.239
It wasn't just us being lonely
or us and him -

35:01.240 --> 35:03.240
it wasn't just that...
He's a poison.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.639
That's what you told me
when we first met.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.039
And now he's got inside you.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.680
He's always been inside me.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.280
And there are reasons for who he is.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.360
And he's my dad.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.280
Meet me tomorrow.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.000
Where?

35:35.920 --> 35:38.160
What'll Max get, if you arrest him?

35:40.080 --> 35:41.280
I don't know.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.559
You don't know what?

35:44.560 --> 35:45.960
If he'll be arrested.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.039
I've told you where the money is,

35:49.040 --> 35:50.559
and how he cleaned it.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.679
With his record, surely that's...
The money's evidence against Roy.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.799
Everything is evidence against Roy.

35:55.800 --> 35:56.959
It's not about Max.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.120
It is for me.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.839
The joyrider in Craigmillar,

36:06.840 --> 36:10.839
a few weeks after the mistrial
they found his body,

36:10.840 --> 36:12.480
right there where he ran her over.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.920
The woman's family all gave
each other alibis.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.479
There's justice and
there's natural justice.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.519
The decisions Max has taken,
the positions he's put himself in,

36:24.520 --> 36:26.079
he'll end up in prison.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.160
Or worse.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.600
And that's not the world I want,
but it's the world we've got.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.040
I don't have it yet.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.120
For you the war is over.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.319
You said two weeks.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.959
You're getting desperate.

36:47.960 --> 36:50.639
And when people doing
what you're doing get desperate,

36:50.640 --> 36:51.960
they get caught.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.720
I'll get you a single cell.
It won't be so bad.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.400
There's something else.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.000
More recent.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.160
Roy and the daughter.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.720
I'm still working it out.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.440
But I think someone
might have been killed.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.039
Maybe at her house.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.760
Over the money that
he brought me.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.559
Joe McLean.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.599
He was found in Corstorphine Woods
last week.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.400
You'll have it down as suicide,
but it wasn't.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.840
She won't have had anything
to do with it, but Roy would.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.600
OK.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.800
Will that do it?

37:42.600 --> 37:43.959
Murder?

37:43.960 --> 37:45.840
Yeah, that'll do it.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.599
Go to work.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.919
Act normal.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.719
Keep your distance.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.880
I'll let you know when
we've taken them in.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.600
Looks pretty at night.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.200
You can't see the dirt.

38:11.280 --> 38:14.679
MUSIC: Go To The Light
by Murder By Death

38:14.680 --> 38:17.920
# A lonesome star in a bitter sky

38:20.360 --> 38:26.240
# I hear the hungry ghosts
calling out in the night

38:27.640 --> 38:34.799
# Just a couple victims of
this brutal reprise

38:34.800 --> 38:37.040
# Am I strong enough

38:38.000 --> 38:40.760
# To let things just die?

38:43.000 --> 38:48.080
# I fight and I fight

38:49.880 --> 38:54.920
# Just to keep the spark alive

38:57.480 --> 39:04.000
# But if there's nothing
on the other side

39:05.200 --> 39:10.440
# Why can't I leave well enough
alone and go to the light?

39:11.960 --> 39:14.520
# Go to the light

39:15.640 --> 39:17.680
# Go to the light

39:19.440 --> 39:24.600
# A shadowy hand turns the page

39:27.400 --> 39:32.680
# A dark theatre,
move across the stage

39:35.400 --> 39:42.440
# Stealing a few extra moments
and fighting against time

39:46.960 --> 39:50.639
# Just let it die
Go to the light

39:50.640 --> 39:54.319
# Just let it die
Go to the light

39:54.320 --> 39:57.040
# Just let it die. #

39:58.640 --> 40:00.119
What is he doing here?

40:00.120 --> 40:01.239
He's cooperating.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.359
He's a target.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.879
Roy's the target.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.359
How is he cooperating?

40:05.360 --> 40:06.839
It's an ongoing situation.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.199
He's been a cancer
in that place for years.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.519
And now I'm here to make amends.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.480
Shut up - you're here
to save your arse.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.079
You can't let him walk for the sake
of a few more years for Roy.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.719
A few more years?

40:18.720 --> 40:20.999
I want Roy to go in there and
never come out,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.160
and you've given me
money laundering.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.960
What did you mean,
an ongoing situation?

40:28.040 --> 40:29.800
Thanks for your help.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.479
You've gone rogue.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.559
I'm calling this in.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.399
She was a grandmother, was she not?

40:38.400 --> 40:39.519
Who?

40:39.520 --> 40:42.559
The women in Craigmillar
that the kid mowed down.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.560
The kid that got the mistrial.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.399
What are you two doing?

40:47.400 --> 40:48.959
Thanks for your help.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.240
And stay out of Leith.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.879
What's happening in Leith?

40:56.880 --> 40:59.679
What did you think he'd do when
you gave him the file?

40:59.680 --> 41:01.639
You're setting up Max.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.159
For Roy.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.479
What Max has come up with,
Roy could get out of in his sleep.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.319
Maybe there's another way
that Max can serve the cause.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.479
You can't do that.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.919
I'm not sure you're a good judge
of what a copper can't do.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.199
I get information for Roy,
a wee bit of driving,

41:15.200 --> 41:16.639
but that's about it... Exactly.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.399
You can't give me Roy either.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.599
So I'll get him myself.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.720
You can't!

41:21.840 --> 41:23.960
And what can you give me instead?

41:29.320 --> 41:32.599
Last week, Roy asked me to give him
an address from a car reg.

41:32.600 --> 41:36.599
The next day, I was out in the car
and I heard it on the radio.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.480
I made sure I got there first
to see what he'd done.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.400
To see what I'd done.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.559
It was a stabbing.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.639
Close enough to the heart
for attempted murder,

41:47.640 --> 41:48.959
and it was Roy.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.639
He wouldn't do it himself.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.519
He would if she told him to.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.079
Who?

41:54.080 --> 41:55.880
The Wicked Witch of the East.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.160
We've taken the land.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.000
Taken it and sold it.

42:08.880 --> 42:10.080
You and Max?

42:12.840 --> 42:14.360
I'm going to meet him now.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.280
I can understand why
you might do that.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.399
I thought I was doing it
because of you.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.160
Now I realise it's because of her.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.720
Everything's because of her.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.560
I wish I'd known you better.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.240
Understood you better.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.960
But it's too late.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.719
I'm doing it to find something
honest, something good.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.759
And I'm...

42:49.760 --> 42:51.159
..going to go meet him now.

42:51.160 --> 42:53.079
We're going to go
somewhere that's...

42:53.080 --> 42:54.400
..not here.

43:05.160 --> 43:08.079
Beware of false prophets...

43:08.080 --> 43:11.279
..who come to you in
sheep's clothing,

43:11.280 --> 43:13.720
but inwardly are ravening wolves.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.799
I don't remember much
from that place,

43:18.800 --> 43:20.599
but I remember the hypocrisy.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.120
I remember the wolves.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.520
That may not surprise you.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.199
But this might.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.439
TV TURNS ON

43:32.440 --> 43:35.559
ON TV: There's something else.
More recent.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.719
Roy and the daughter.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.079
I'm still working it out.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.919
But I think someone
may have been killed.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.759
Maybe at our house.

43:44.760 --> 43:47.999
Over the money that he brought me.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.479
Joe MacLean.

43:49.480 --> 43:52.879
He was found off the woods last
week, wrote it down as suicide.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.039
But it wasn't.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.600
TV TURNS OFF

44:00.440 --> 44:03.159
They've got nothing on us.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.119
Except Max.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.800
Max gives them a shot.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.280
What are you going to do?

44:16.640 --> 44:18.200
Don't meet him.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.960
He won't be there.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.560
Why can't I escape?

44:28.560 --> 44:31.400
You, her, this world of
endless fucking liars.

44:35.280 --> 44:38.120
You'll never know the lives
your mother and I were given.

44:40.720 --> 44:44.479
The wreckage that we crawled from.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.759
We were sent into life unarmed,

44:46.760 --> 44:48.160
and it showed.

44:51.080 --> 44:53.840
I'm sorry for what that
meant for you.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.319
It ruined me.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.319
No.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.840
You survived.

45:02.040 --> 45:04.120
And now, you'll do more than that.

45:05.880 --> 45:08.480
You can't not, the woman you are.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.400
I just don't know how many more
chances I'll get to say that.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.840
Because life might
pull us apart again.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.280
And I wish I had the education
to say it better.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.599
The pride I feel.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.440
That I've always felt...

45:33.480 --> 45:36.080
..in getting to call you
my daughter.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.840
Bye, Dad.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.359
You took your time.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.000
Got there in the end.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.760
How can I help?

46:29.200 --> 46:31.079
You'll talk.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.599
And you'll talk a little more
on top, so we don't look

46:33.600 --> 46:35.999
into what he was doing here.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.160
Sorry, love, you've lost me.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.359
It's a nice place, this.

46:41.360 --> 46:45.399
Secure. With all the cameras.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.399
They picked up the two of you.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.160
You had a little chat.

46:51.640 --> 46:55.759
Common purpose.
That's the legal doctrine.

46:55.760 --> 46:59.319
Which means you'll both get
charged with attempted murder.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.320
Which fuels fear, does it not?

47:02.520 --> 47:05.480
You and Roy,
and your common purpose.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.999
I felt bad...

47:13.000 --> 47:15.160
..for what happened to your family.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.360
Not as bad as I did.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.560
And I always said to Roy
that it would be you.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.800
Hope you get the chance to
tell them that you were right.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.519
I'm allowed a phone call.

47:33.520 --> 47:34.880
It's too late.

47:40.160 --> 47:43.359
Can you get me my chair,
please, love?

47:43.360 --> 47:45.960
And my pills, from the bathroom?

47:50.320 --> 47:51.920
Dementia.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.759
Gets worse with the day.

47:55.760 --> 47:58.400
God knows what a judge
will make of it.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.959
Have you stopped the other thing?

48:14.960 --> 48:16.480
What other thing?

I'm Roy Lynch.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.520
I know.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.799
The soldier.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.640
He was my brother.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.880
And there's something
about brothers.

50:11.720 --> 50:15.480
I used to say,
"Blood's thicker than water".

50:17.520 --> 50:20.880
But Maxie told me that's not
the original saying.

50:22.080 --> 50:25.640
It was actually about blood
being spilt on the field.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.840
And how that's the thickest
blood in the game.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.280
And that's OK.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.079
That makes sense, too.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.759
I don't know what Max told you,
but she had nothing to do with it.

50:41.760 --> 50:43.400
It was her house.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.919
Her husband was a degenerate

50:47.920 --> 50:49.440
and died in an act of patience.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.120
Your brother was...

50:53.840 --> 50:55.400
..unfortunate.

50:56.720 --> 51:00.919
And now, you have to do what you
have to do. I understand that.

51:00.920 --> 51:03.679
I respect that.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.640
But she has nothing to do with it.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.600
Maxie said that, too.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.320
That's fair.

51:50.880 --> 51:52.680
Are you from Leith, son?

51:54.960 --> 51:56.480
Aye.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.840
Well, that's something.

Hi.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.919
I'm here, and you're not.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.240
You don't need me. Not for this.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.119
The escape you wanted, it's not me.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.920
It's not the money, either.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.640
I can give you
the escape you wanted.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.359
I can release you.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.559
If that's what you want.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.119
What is this?

53:08.120 --> 53:09.719
I could've told you last night,

53:09.720 --> 53:12.080
but I'd only have done it
to hurt Roy.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.720
But now, it would be for you.

53:22.120 --> 53:24.279
What's in there?

53:24.280 --> 53:25.960
Everything you need.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.880
Everything you weren't given.

53:31.920 --> 53:33.960
You just need to ask.

53:36.320 --> 53:37.879
Tell me.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.160
And I want you to know,
this isn't...

53:42.920 --> 53:46.079
It's not about revenge, because
revenge only gets you halfway.

53:46.080 --> 53:48.480
What I've given you comes...

53:50.960 --> 53:53.799
..from love.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.480
And hope.

53:56.600 --> 53:58.320
For you and for me.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.440
I'm giving you what I never had.

54:05.080 --> 54:06.480
So you can heal.

54:08.720 --> 54:10.480
Like I never did.
