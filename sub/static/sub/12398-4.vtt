So how long you been
working for Gogol?

32:39.416 --> 32:42.658
Birkhoff, Nikita hung up on me
and I can't get her back on the line.

32:42.878 --> 32:43.913
You have her location?

32:44.129 --> 32:48.122
She's just off the main road.
I'm sending you coordinates now.

I sat in a cell, waiting to die.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.092
Ari offered me a way out.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.724
Ari broke you out to kill me.
What are you waiting for?

33:03.064 --> 33:04.975
Killing you wasn't my mission.

33:05.192 --> 33:08.355
As much as Ari wants you dead,
he wants Percy's black box more.

-You lost your shot at it.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.692
When I told Ari about Alex,
my orders changed.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.278
I went from Trojan horse to bait.

33:19.498 --> 33:23.036
And that phone
is how Gogol knows we're here.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.750

are using, these guys are not Division.

The flat tire, it's a trap for Alex.

33:47.817 --> 33:51.480

Russian transmitters at your location.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.108
Gogol is already there, Nikita.
