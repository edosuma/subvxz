00:02.025 --> 00:03.690
<i>Kids, this is the story</i>

00:03.707 --> 00:06.358
<i>of a wedding day
that went horribly wrong.</i>

00:07.199 --> 00:08.899
Ted, the bride wants to see you.

00:10.873 --> 00:13.992
<i>Uncle Barney
was getting married.</i>

00:14.439 --> 00:17.490
How the hell did we get there?

00:20.085 --> 00:21.502
I love the name Marvin.

00:21.637 --> 00:22.970
Marv.

00:22.972 --> 00:25.089
Sounds like a little
middle-aged man.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.024
Golf next weekend, Marv?

00:27.026 --> 00:28.693
How's that tax report
coming, Marv?

00:28.695 --> 00:30.427
At your age,
erectile dysfunction

00:30.429 --> 00:32.563
is nothing to be
ashamed of, Marv.

00:34.032 --> 00:36.100
<i>It was a beautiful moment.</i>

00:36.102 --> 00:38.452
<i>But then a thought popped
into my head, kids.</i>

00:38.454 --> 00:40.404
<i>The same thought that will pop
into your heads</i>

00:40.406 --> 00:43.457
<i>the first time you see your
best friend holding their baby.</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:47.461
Wonder how much this would hurt.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.934
<i>That guy's a dad.</i>

00:56.889 --> 00:58.923
Oh, I think he's hungry.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.175
Oh, we'll give
you some privacy.

01:02.838 --> 01:05.542
Wow. Seeing them in there
all together like that,

01:05.563 --> 01:07.480
they're a family, you know?

01:07.748 --> 01:09.115
That's what I want.

01:09.161 --> 01:11.995
Oh, Ted, I'm glad
we're friends again.

01:12.013 --> 01:13.096
Me, too.

01:13.113 --> 01:15.780
Because as your friend,
I have to tell you:

01:15.806 --> 01:16.972
You're full of crap!

01:17.590 --> 01:19.005
You say you want a family,

01:19.034 --> 01:21.177
you say
you want to meet "The One,"

01:21.216 --> 01:23.985
but you are always chasing
the wrong women.

01:24.014 --> 01:25.014
That is not true.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.893
Look at the women you date,
starting with me:

01:26.924 --> 01:29.992
I told you right away
I didn't want marriage or kids.

01:30.037 --> 01:33.655
Stella had a child with another
man who she still loved.

01:33.657 --> 01:37.342
Zoey was married and trying
to sabotage your career

01:37.344 --> 01:39.578
and wore a lot of stupid hats.

01:39.580 --> 01:42.443
Hats were in that year, kind of.

01:42.508 --> 01:44.508
Name one exception.

01:45.103 --> 01:46.505
Victoria.

01:46.626 --> 01:48.349
<i>Victoria was great.</i>

01:48.368 --> 01:50.400
Exactly,
and you threw it all away

01:50.414 --> 01:52.698
to chase after some hot piece
of ass.

01:52.802 --> 01:55.269
- You mean you?
- Thank you!

01:55.271 --> 01:58.439
Victoria is the only
woman you've dated

01:58.441 --> 01:59.840
who could've been "The One."

01:59.842 --> 02:01.108
You should call her.

02:01.110 --> 02:04.133
Tiny thing, last time I saw her,
she was getting engaged.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.710
That was eight months ago.

02:05.748 --> 02:07.131
For all you know,
she's single again.

02:07.157 --> 02:08.002
What if she's married?

02:08.032 --> 02:09.065
What if she's not?

02:09.090 --> 02:10.348
Then you would actually
have a chance

02:10.372 --> 02:13.483
to get what you say you want,
and it terrifies you.

02:15.255 --> 02:16.362
Whoa.

02:16.395 --> 02:18.090
What's wrong?

02:18.145 --> 02:19.961
I ruined things with Quinn.

02:19.963 --> 02:21.980
I insisted she stop stripping,

02:21.982 --> 02:23.412
we got in a huge fight about it,

02:23.418 --> 02:26.636
then I ran off to Atlantic City
for two days without calling.

02:27.154 --> 02:29.771
What the hell
am I coming home to?

02:32.570 --> 02:35.638
Let's have an eight-way with
my six hottest stripper friends.

02:35.672 --> 02:38.262
Um, how is that a punishment?

02:38.282 --> 02:39.482
Wait for it.

02:39.521 --> 02:40.922
But I forbid you from filming it

02:40.952 --> 02:42.051
with your overhead camera

02:42.064 --> 02:44.198
that zooms in
on whoever's being the loudest.

02:45.538 --> 02:49.625
Nooooo!

02:49.627 --> 02:51.960
No, that's too cruel.

02:53.195 --> 02:56.660
Or, you know,
maybe Quinn's moved out.

02:56.933 --> 02:59.635
I didn't even think of that!

03:04.838 --> 03:06.189
Hi.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.954
Welcome home.

03:09.269 --> 03:12.730
I decided the place was a bit
too "American Psycho" for me,

03:12.770 --> 03:15.387
so while you were gone,
I hired a decorator

03:15.528 --> 03:16.527
and I asked him,

03:16.544 --> 03:17.810
"What would the inside

03:17.836 --> 03:19.997
of Tinkerbell's vagina
look like?"

03:20.066 --> 03:22.333
And the kid just ran with it!

03:23.821 --> 03:26.323
So... what do you think?

03:27.623 --> 03:31.291
Thank God you're still here!

03:33.227 --> 03:35.412
Welcome home.

<i>Lily and Marshall asked Robin

03:54.245 --> 03:56.728
<i>for Baby Marvin's
Birth Announcement card</i>

03:56.761 --> 03:58.561
<i>instead of me.</i>

03:58.594 --> 03:59.593
<i>Whatever.</i>

03:59.650 --> 04:00.983
<i>The only problem?</i>

04:07.958 --> 04:09.365
Okay. How about this?

04:09.407 --> 04:11.908
Tomorrow, we go
to Central Park at sunset

04:11.910 --> 04:14.827
and we get the perfect picture
in the perfect setting.

04:14.829 --> 04:16.329
Oh, I like that.

04:16.331 --> 04:19.197
It'll be Marvin's first
outing into the world.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.867
You're gonna love
the park, buddy.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.919
It's a great place
to meet chicks.

04:22.921 --> 04:25.204
Or-or dudes.

04:25.206 --> 04:26.456
Or both.

04:26.458 --> 04:28.841
Oh, we love you no matter what!

04:28.843 --> 04:32.445
<i>And kids, as I watched your
Aunt Lily hold her baby boy,</i>

04:32.447 --> 04:34.480
<i>another thought
popped into my head.</i>

04:34.482 --> 04:36.883
Even though you
didn't buy anything,

04:36.885 --> 04:39.302
I want to thank you
for coming in.

04:39.304 --> 04:40.603
Here's a free teddy bear.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.672
What are you gonna
name the little guy?

04:43.806 --> 04:46.292
Six Pack.

04:48.395 --> 04:50.313
Gun it, bitches!

04:51.266 --> 04:53.066
<i>That girl's a mom!</i>

05:00.095 --> 05:03.134
Okay, so I met this girl
on the train,

05:03.176 --> 05:04.739
and I texted her, "What's up"

05:04.782 --> 05:07.470
She texted,
"Hey," exclamation point.

05:07.492 --> 05:10.305
Does that mean,
"Ask me out" or "Just..."

05:10.323 --> 05:14.775
Ted, we are responsible for
a whole other human life now,

05:15.027 --> 05:19.590
so new rule: You can't come
to us with any issue unless

05:19.621 --> 05:21.009
it's an "8" or higher.

05:21.033 --> 05:22.366
Got it.

05:22.977 --> 05:25.243
So I'm thinking of texting
back a winky smiley face.

05:25.274 --> 05:26.881
Eight or higher, bro.

05:26.913 --> 05:27.912
Well, no, what should I--

05:27.946 --> 05:29.196
Eight or higher, bro.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.569
No, yeah,
I'm just wondering if--

05:30.585 --> 05:32.335
Eight or higher, bro.

05:32.337 --> 05:34.254
Well, where do you rate this?

05:34.256 --> 05:37.674
This is the same as what's in
little Marvin's pants right now:

05:38.168 --> 05:39.984
A soft two.

05:42.225 --> 05:43.515
Sorry, bro.

05:43.614 --> 05:47.302
Stop texting the bimbo
and call Victoria.

05:47.369 --> 05:48.685
That chapter's over.

05:48.687 --> 05:50.553
W-We just weren't destined
to be together.

05:50.555 --> 05:56.119
"Destined." Aren't you tired
of waiting for destiny, Ted?

05:56.244 --> 05:59.228
Isn't it time
to make your own destiny?

05:59.985 --> 06:02.066
Hey, false alarm.

06:02.339 --> 06:04.516
What I was smelling was
the previous poop,

06:04.557 --> 06:07.393
which, apparently, is
still somewhere on my

06:07.412 --> 06:09.988
clothes and/or in my hair.

06:10.265 --> 06:12.533
- Hold him, would you?
- Oh.

06:15.198 --> 06:16.949
- Ooh.
- Yeah, smart.

06:19.781 --> 06:23.218
Oh, sure, that one
turns out great. Ugh.

06:24.111 --> 06:26.962
- And then another thought popped-

06:27.222 --> 06:30.456
<i>That guy's nowhere
near being a dad.</i>

06:35.484 --> 06:36.817
<i>Hello?</i>

06:36.935 --> 06:39.666
Hey, Victoria, it's Ted.

06:39.694 --> 06:41.610
Um, listen, I was just wondering

06:42.018 --> 06:45.253
if you wanted to catch up
sometime; it's been a while.

06:45.302 --> 06:46.601
<i>That sounds nice.</i>

06:47.384 --> 06:49.728
<i>I'm actually around
this afternoon.</i>

06:49.911 --> 06:51.981
Oh, wow, uh, great.

06:52.039 --> 06:53.634
MacLaren's at 2:00?

06:53.668 --> 06:55.468
<i>Is 1:30 okay?</i>

06:55.470 --> 06:57.343
<i>I might have a thing later.</i>

06:57.455 --> 06:59.392
Yeah. Yeah. See you then.

06:59.457 --> 07:00.974
<i>See you then.</i>

07:01.734 --> 07:04.307
<i>Meanwhile, Barney
and Quinn were off to Hawaii</i>

07:04.321 --> 07:06.141
<i>for their first getaway
as a couple.</i>

07:06.198 --> 07:08.095
Ma'am, I need you
to open your suitcase.

07:08.183 --> 07:09.582
It's mine.

07:09.584 --> 07:11.851
Did you have
to replace my luggage, too?

07:11.853 --> 07:15.154
Run away on me again, you'll
be wearing hot pink stilettos.

07:15.156 --> 07:17.607
What's that?

07:17.609 --> 07:18.658
Yeah, what is that?

07:18.660 --> 07:20.493
It's a magic trick.

07:20.495 --> 07:23.145
You see, I'm something
of a magician.

07:23.147 --> 07:24.146
Open the box, sir.

07:24.148 --> 07:26.532
Oh, I can't do that.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.470
Sir, are there drugs
in that box?

07:30.472 --> 07:32.622
Oh, no. He's probably
just barking

07:32.624 --> 07:33.923
because of the explosives.

07:33.925 --> 07:36.259
Oh, my God!

07:36.261 --> 07:38.394
Tell us what's
in the box right now!

07:38.396 --> 07:39.712
I can't.

07:39.714 --> 07:42.115
Magician's Code.

07:43.384 --> 07:46.656
<i>Okay, I need to figure out
if Victoria ever got engaged.</i>

07:46.680 --> 07:50.632
<i>I'll have to very subtly
check for an engagement ring.</i>

07:53.152 --> 07:56.288
<i>Hmm, can't see the left hand.</i>

08:01.004 --> 08:02.466
Open the box now!

08:02.918 --> 08:04.303
I can't.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.786
Magician's Code.

08:06.273 --> 08:08.251
What the hell is
the Magician's Code?!

08:08.280 --> 08:11.064
"A magician never
reveals his tricks."

08:11.104 --> 08:12.846
Mr. Flanagan, my magic mentor

08:12.869 --> 08:15.704
from the hallowed
Staten Island Mall Magic Shop,

08:15.837 --> 08:17.798
taught me the importance
of the Code

08:17.831 --> 08:21.672
one fateful autumn
night in 1993.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.830
Hello? Mr. Flanagan.

08:25.027 --> 08:27.203
Wh-What are you doing here?

08:27.254 --> 08:30.456
Um...
I'm checking up on you.

08:30.489 --> 08:33.606
Just to make sure
you're practicing your craft

08:33.635 --> 08:34.885
or whatever.

08:35.183 --> 08:37.585
That is an honor, sir.

08:37.623 --> 08:40.256
And yeah, I promise,
I'm practicing.

08:40.517 --> 08:41.883
But wait.

08:41.885 --> 08:44.019
Why were you, why were you
going in my mom's room?

08:44.020 --> 08:46.771
Uh... your mom's actually
helping me with a new trick.

08:46.810 --> 08:48.560
That is so cool!

08:48.764 --> 08:49.869
What is this trick?

08:49.876 --> 08:51.452
Is it sawing a lady in half?

08:52.672 --> 08:54.272
Well, not sawing.

08:54.314 --> 08:55.165
But actually,

08:55.188 --> 08:56.696
the Magician's Code forbids me

08:56.738 --> 08:59.251
from telling you anything else
about the trick.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.789
<i>Wayne, come back to bed!</i>

09:01.791 --> 09:03.707
Okay, it involves a bed.

09:04.770 --> 09:06.762
W-W-Wait. Can
you at least

09:06.791 --> 09:08.424
tell me the name of this trick?

09:08.996 --> 09:10.661
Sure, kid.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.182
It's called--

09:12.184 --> 09:14.318
The Disappearing Salami.

09:15.336 --> 09:17.421
Mr. Flanagan's wife shot him

09:17.423 --> 09:20.324
before he could ever tell me
what the trick was.

09:20.326 --> 09:21.746
Yeah, that guy was
banging your mom.

09:21.820 --> 09:22.643
Yup.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.777
Totally.

09:23.779 --> 09:25.863
Mr. Flanagan was not ban--

09:25.865 --> 09:27.865
Oh, my God, he was.

09:27.867 --> 09:31.201
Wait, why are you bringing
a magic trick to Hawaii anyway?

09:31.203 --> 09:34.655
I was hoping to shoot up
to Honolulu

09:34.657 --> 09:36.624
for the Worldwide
Magic Convention.

09:36.626 --> 09:38.525
Don't worry. You'll
notice I was gone.

09:38.527 --> 09:40.527
It's only three
14-hour days.

09:40.529 --> 09:42.212
So on our romantic getaway

09:42.214 --> 09:44.965
to help me forget about
you skipping town on me,

09:44.967 --> 09:46.667
you're skipping town on me?!

09:46.669 --> 09:50.619
Look Quinn, you're
very important to me,

09:50.845 --> 09:55.299
but you're sharing my heart
with an equally important Miss.

09:55.377 --> 09:59.313
Miss...

09:59.315 --> 10:01.315
Direction.

10:01.871 --> 10:03.037
What?

10:03.652 --> 10:04.652
H...

10:04.654 --> 10:06.403
Shoot him.

10:06.405 --> 10:09.056
So what did you order?

10:09.058 --> 10:11.442
Oh, just black coffee.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.660
I like it that way, too.

10:12.662 --> 10:14.244
Yeah, it just tastes
better to me.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.030
I find that if the coffee beans
are good enough,

10:16.032 --> 10:18.732
you really don't need--
Why are you in a wedding dress?!

10:18.734 --> 10:22.235
Well, I'm sort of supposed to...

10:22.237 --> 10:24.955
get married today.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.573
All your friends and family
are waiting for you

10:26.575 --> 10:27.758
in some church right now?

10:27.760 --> 10:31.462
Well, not all; we had
five last-minute no-shows.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.913
Well... six.

10:33.905 --> 10:35.697
Mazel tov, Ted.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.218
I was starting to think
this would never happen.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.303
Oh, no, Mrs. Matsen--

10:39.305 --> 10:41.221
I told you he wasn't gay.

10:41.223 --> 10:42.923
Wait, what?

10:42.950 --> 10:45.067
I was tempted to leave Klaus
for you last fall.

10:46.194 --> 10:48.820
The only thing holding me back
was the Robin of it all.

10:48.852 --> 10:51.681
I know, and you were right,
but... but that's all over now.

10:51.743 --> 10:55.212
She moved out-- I mean, we're
still friends, but that's over.

10:55.842 --> 10:59.660
All these years, I never stopped
thinking about you, Ted.

11:00.382 --> 11:02.300
I've got a car outside

11:02.359 --> 11:05.994
if you're ready to drive off
into the sunset together.

11:07.737 --> 11:10.457
But if you don't feel
the same way,

11:10.543 --> 11:13.324
if you've closed the door on us,

11:13.417 --> 11:15.134
just say the word...

11:15.355 --> 11:16.904
and I'll go.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.634
Barney, tell them the trick.

11:19.636 --> 11:22.270
The only person I could possibly
reveal the trick to

11:22.272 --> 11:23.304
is another magician.

11:24.368 --> 11:26.751
Well, I'm a magician.

11:27.515 --> 11:29.281
Prove it.

11:35.016 --> 11:36.067
Whoo-hoo!

11:45.577 --> 11:46.878
<i>That's Barney's version.</i>

11:46.880 --> 11:48.880
<i>Quinn said it was
a simple card trick.</i>

11:48.882 --> 11:51.549
<i>Who's to say which
version was true?</i>

11:51.551 --> 11:53.384
<i>Quinn's.
Quinn's version was true.</i>

11:55.237 --> 11:56.554
Okay.

11:56.556 --> 11:58.756
I'll tell you.

12:01.396 --> 12:04.131
Oh, that's really cool.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.204
So what's the trick?

12:06.246 --> 12:08.296
I can't say.
Magician's Code.

12:09.217 --> 12:11.218
Ta-da...

12:11.220 --> 12:13.521
da-da-da-da-da-da.

12:15.441 --> 12:16.441
Hello.

12:16.826 --> 12:19.093
Why did you make me
call Victoria?

12:19.162 --> 12:20.745
She's here in a wedding dress.

12:20.747 --> 12:23.080
I'm the verge of
ruining a wedding!

12:23.082 --> 12:24.449
And Mrs. Madsen's friend
thinks I'm gay,

12:24.451 --> 12:26.033
but let's put a pin
in that till later.

12:26.035 --> 12:28.202
Oh, my God.
Victoria's at the bar with Ted.

12:28.204 --> 12:29.704
That's a seven.

12:29.706 --> 12:31.339
And she's in a wedding dress.

12:32.207 --> 12:33.257
That's a ten.

12:33.610 --> 12:35.777
We got a ten!

12:36.578 --> 12:38.746
What are you gonna do?
Where is she right now?

12:38.748 --> 12:40.214
So this dress, what's the cut?

12:40.216 --> 12:42.300
Are we talking princess,
ball gown, column?

12:42.302 --> 12:45.803
Right, 'cause it's a federal
crime to love weddings.

12:45.805 --> 12:47.305
She's in the bathroom,
which I guess

12:47.307 --> 12:50.024
takes forever with that
giant poufy skirt thing.

12:50.026 --> 12:52.276
Ball gown. Thank you.

12:52.278 --> 12:53.361
Four shots of tequila.

12:53.363 --> 12:54.779
Ted, calm down.

12:54.781 --> 12:56.697
Or not. This is your chance
to get the one who got away.

12:56.699 --> 12:58.232
You want her, she wants you,

12:58.234 --> 12:59.617
what's the problem?

12:59.619 --> 13:02.203
The problem is Victoria's in
the middle of a giant freak-out.

13:02.205 --> 13:04.271
What if she winds up
regretting this decision?

13:04.273 --> 13:06.290
She's going after Ted Mosby.

13:06.292 --> 13:08.476
That's the best decision
she's ever made.

13:08.478 --> 13:10.294
There you go.

13:15.534 --> 13:17.440
- Whoa. What was that?
- What?

13:17.487 --> 13:20.488
You said you wanted a picture
of Baby Marvin's first outing.

13:21.846 --> 13:23.511
Our baby's first outing

13:23.538 --> 13:24.771
was to a bar.

13:25.842 --> 13:28.543
I dribble Cuervo
on Marv's soft spot.

13:28.561 --> 13:29.360
Here she comes! Quick!

13:29.362 --> 13:30.761
Oh, yeah.

13:30.763 --> 13:32.095
Eggshell or cream?

13:32.097 --> 13:34.281
Is it eggshell or cream?

13:35.767 --> 13:36.734
So.

13:36.736 --> 13:40.321
You... me...
riding off into the sunset.

13:40.323 --> 13:42.105
Any thoughts?

13:43.486 --> 13:44.937
One question:

13:45.293 --> 13:46.627
FDR or Westside Highway,

13:46.629 --> 13:48.379
what's the quickest
way to the sunset?

13:53.879 --> 13:56.507
I need to ask you both
a few questions.

13:56.527 --> 13:57.759
Let's start with you.

13:57.803 --> 13:58.802
Name?

13:58.826 --> 13:59.950
Quinn Garvey.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.053
Occupation?

14:01.110 --> 14:02.013
Unemployed.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.353
Well, well, well.

14:03.368 --> 14:05.092
Look who's keeping secrets now.

14:05.129 --> 14:07.579
Sir, I'll tell you her
stripper.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.246
She insists she's proud of it,

14:09.279 --> 14:11.763
but apparently not
proud enough to tell you.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.297
Barney, I was going to surprise
you with this on our trip,

14:15.377 --> 14:17.894
but... I quit.

14:19.468 --> 14:21.736
You... did that for me?

14:21.738 --> 14:23.221
Yes.

14:23.223 --> 14:25.903
And now that you know
what I did for you,

14:25.992 --> 14:28.125
and how much I care for you,

14:28.189 --> 14:31.023
would you please
show him the trick?

14:35.866 --> 14:39.152
Sorry. Magician's Code.

14:42.967 --> 14:44.518
Where should we go?

14:44.853 --> 14:46.143
Your place?

14:46.190 --> 14:47.208
My place?

14:47.256 --> 14:48.456
We could go on my honeymoon.

14:49.999 --> 14:50.998
Just kidding.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.084
Although, it is paid for.

14:54.887 --> 14:56.854
- I know where we should go.
- Where?

14:57.098 --> 14:58.882
Your wedding.

14:58.938 --> 15:00.929
I'm taking you back.

15:07.669 --> 15:09.752
I don't understand.

15:09.807 --> 15:11.106
I thought you wanted this.

15:11.123 --> 15:12.948
I do want this.

15:13.343 --> 15:15.815
I've thought about you
so many times.

15:15.939 --> 15:17.846
What might have been...

15:18.250 --> 15:21.317
But I got left at the altar,
and it nearly killed me.

15:22.374 --> 15:23.708
You're someone's fiancé,

15:23.725 --> 15:25.558
and I have to respect that.

15:26.587 --> 15:28.339
So let's hit a motel,
jam in a quickie,

15:28.355 --> 15:29.431
and get you back
to your wedding.

15:30.854 --> 15:33.070
It's the right thing to do.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.813
Some part of me
needed to hear you say

15:35.838 --> 15:37.738
that running away together
wasn't an option.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.000
And now that I know that...

15:40.663 --> 15:42.880
it's like I'm sobering up.

15:45.408 --> 15:46.525
Is there any way

15:46.527 --> 15:49.077
that we can just pretend
this never happened?

15:51.139 --> 15:52.606
This never happened.

15:57.616 --> 16:00.402
Mr. Flanagan wasn't
banging my mom.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.256
Well.

16:03.298 --> 16:05.098
Your flight left.

16:05.295 --> 16:09.126
We need to hold Mr. Stinson
for further questioning.

16:09.210 --> 16:10.742
But you're free to go.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.606
Maybe I should.

16:16.099 --> 16:18.718
Wait!

16:19.308 --> 16:20.642
I'll show you the trick.

16:26.090 --> 16:27.456
Sir!

16:27.517 --> 16:29.150
May I please have
the silk handkerchief

16:29.152 --> 16:30.485
in your top left breast pocket?

16:30.487 --> 16:32.654
Well... I don't have...

16:45.001 --> 16:49.370
Sim salabi ma...
sim salabi ma...

16:52.142 --> 16:53.642
Relax, relax,
it's part of the trick.

16:53.644 --> 16:55.393
How did you get that
through the X-Ray machine?

16:55.395 --> 16:57.178
No questions from
the audience, please!

17:11.027 --> 17:11.992
What is that?

17:11.994 --> 17:13.161
Madam, may I please have

17:13.163 --> 17:15.063
the key on your necklace?

17:15.830 --> 17:16.830
Oh!

17:24.124 --> 17:25.540
Is that gonna explode?

17:25.541 --> 17:26.907
What?

17:30.931 --> 17:32.464
Ahem.

17:34.685 --> 17:36.968
What?

18:01.572 --> 18:03.973
Will you marry me?

18:05.884 --> 18:07.051
Yes.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.123
Come on, guys.

18:14.182 --> 18:17.432
We're losing the light
for Baby's Second First Outing.

18:26.887 --> 18:29.622
<i>I hate to say it,
but Robin nailed it.</i>

18:33.142 --> 18:35.476
- Hey.
- Guys, we've got something to tell you.

18:35.478 --> 18:37.195
Eight or higher, bro.

18:37.197 --> 18:38.697
We're engaged.

18:38.699 --> 18:41.449
That's a... that's a ten.

18:41.451 --> 18:43.451
We got another ten!

18:43.453 --> 18:45.120
- Oh...
- Wow, big day!

18:45.122 --> 18:47.539
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

18:47.541 --> 18:49.323
How did this happen?

18:49.817 --> 18:52.035
Oh... magic.

18:52.828 --> 18:54.045
Oh.

18:54.047 --> 18:55.430
Uh, not to ruin the moment,

18:55.432 --> 18:58.717
but apparently little Marvin
is quite stunned by the news.

18:58.719 --> 19:01.186
Well...

19:01.188 --> 19:02.520
- Yeah. Wow.
- Yeah.

19:02.522 --> 19:04.689
Do you guys mind
recounting this romantic tale

19:04.691 --> 19:06.107
next to a Diaper Genie?

19:06.109 --> 19:11.179
Oh, Marvin, you're about to
hear your first love story!

19:11.181 --> 19:12.513
Once up on a time,

19:12.515 --> 19:15.734
this creepy magic dude
was boning Barney's mom...

19:21.407 --> 19:23.074
It's our last chance
to run away together.

19:23.076 --> 19:24.125
Door's right there.

19:24.127 --> 19:25.744
Yes, we'll start a new life.

19:25.746 --> 19:27.212
- Head for the border!
- Canada!

19:27.214 --> 19:29.164
Eh, Mexico.
Canada sucks.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.965
Okay, well,
you're one-quarter Canadian,

19:30.967 --> 19:32.801
so by that logic
you one-quarter suck.

19:32.803 --> 19:34.169
I'm 100% awesome

19:34.171 --> 19:35.670
and you know it.

19:36.694 --> 19:38.295
Yeah, I do.

19:42.062 --> 19:45.647
Look, I-I hope this isn't weird,
or anything, because...

19:45.649 --> 19:47.515
Barney...

19:47.517 --> 19:50.018
I'm... I'm really happy for you.
