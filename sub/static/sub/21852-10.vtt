He's gonna get me!

00:46.881 --> 00:48.424
Honey, honey,
who's gonna get you?

00:48.591 --> 00:50.593
The president!
I saw him!

00:50.760 --> 00:52.261
He's gonna get me!

00:52.428 --> 00:55.181
Crystal, the president
isn't going to get you.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.390
But I saw him!

00:56.557 --> 00:58.059
See what I told you?

00:58.225 --> 00:59.435
It's that liberal school
she's going to,

00:59.602 --> 01:01.812
filling her head
with all kinds of garbage.

01:01.979 --> 01:05.066
Sweetie, the president is doing
the best job he can.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.859
Your liberal school
is just trying

01:07.026 --> 01:08.194
to convince you
he's dangerous.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.612
But -- But, Daddy,
he's gonna --

01:09.779 --> 01:10.863
Unh-unh.
No "buts."

01:11.030 --> 01:12.740
The president is
in the White House,

01:12.907 --> 01:15.451
not here trying
to get you, okay?

01:15.618 --> 01:18.037
- Okay.
- All right.

01:18.204 --> 01:20.372
We're having a talk with
that school in the morning.

01:20.539 --> 01:23.000
Goodnight, honey.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.431
Hey! How are
my approval ratings?

01:41.477 --> 01:42.853
<i>And the latest reports
are now saying</i>

01:43.020 --> 01:44.563
<i>that over a million Canadians</i>

01:44.730 --> 01:46.774
<i>were killed
in the nuclear blast.</i>

01:46.941 --> 01:48.901
<i>The bomb dropped
by the U.S. President</i>

01:49.068 --> 01:50.945
<i>took out the entire city
of Toronto</i>

01:51.112 --> 01:53.322
<i>and fallout is expected
to kill thousands more</i>

01:53.489 --> 01:54.782
<i>in the coming days.</i>

01:58.661 --> 02:00.746
Ike.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.165
Ike,
I'm sorry that I...

02:03.332 --> 02:06.210
'caused a nuclear bomb
to be dropped on Canada.

02:06.377 --> 02:07.461
I was just --

02:07.628 --> 02:08.879
You know, I was just trying

02:09.046 --> 02:10.756
to get shows that were toxic
taken down.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.675
You know, those shows
can be really harmful.

02:12.842 --> 02:14.510
Oh, stop being
a victim.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.804
Jesus Christ!

02:22.518 --> 02:24.895
What I want to know
is what gives you the right

02:25.062 --> 02:28.065
to preach your political views
to my children?!

02:28.232 --> 02:30.401
Our daughter
woke up with nightmares

02:30.568 --> 02:32.778
that the president
was going to get her.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.780
Just because
two liberals happen to be

02:34.947 --> 02:36.282
principal
and vice principal

02:36.448 --> 02:38.826
doesn't mean
you can brainwash my kids!

02:38.993 --> 02:40.703
Uh, we sort of have
some bigger problems

02:40.870 --> 02:42.163
right now, Mister, uh...

02:42.329 --> 02:44.206
It's White.
Bob White.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.709
You've probably never even
heard of our family, huh?

02:46.876 --> 02:49.545
Well, the Whites have been here
since the beginning!

02:49.712 --> 02:50.921
Not that it matters.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.631
'Cause no one cares
about the Whites!

02:52.798 --> 02:54.466
Sure, everyone else
has problems,

02:54.633 --> 02:57.261
but does anyone ever ask
the Whites how they're doing?

02:57.428 --> 02:59.346
Mr. White, we assure you
that we run the school

02:59.513 --> 03:01.390
in a very...
professional manner

03:01.557 --> 03:03.767
and don't let...
personal emotions

03:03.934 --> 03:06.020
get in the way.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.938
Oh, sure you don't!

03:08.105 --> 03:09.315
You know how hard
I had to fight

03:09.481 --> 03:10.983
to even get
this meeting with you?

03:11.150 --> 03:13.235
"Oh, who wants
to talk to the administration?"

03:13.402 --> 03:14.820
"Oh, it's just the Whites?"

03:14.987 --> 03:17.072
"Aw, who cares about the Whites?
They're fine."

03:17.239 --> 03:20.159
Well, we've just about
had it you...

03:20.326 --> 03:24.788
<i>♪ If loving you is wrong,
I don't wanna be right ♪</i>

03:24.955 --> 03:26.665
<i>♪ I don't wanna be right ♪</i>

03:26.832 --> 03:30.586
...and, damn it,
we won't be ignored!

03:30.753 --> 03:32.296
I'm sorry. Is anyone else
hearing

03:32.463 --> 03:35.966
"I Don't Want to Be Right"

03:36.133 --> 03:37.676
Uh, no.
Mr. and Mrs. White,

03:37.843 --> 03:40.387
we promise that we will not
let anything happen

03:40.554 --> 03:45.184
that might bring the integrity
of this school into question.

03:45.351 --> 03:48.062
Guess that's all the Whites
can hope for these days.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.376
Hey!

04:12.002 --> 04:13.170
How are
my approval ratings?

04:13.337 --> 04:15.506
It's the president!

04:15.673 --> 04:19.009
Wait, come back!
What's wrong?!

04:19.176 --> 04:21.387
Still no word
from the president

04:21.553 --> 04:23.514
as his 'Splatty Tomato'
approval rating

04:23.681 --> 04:26.850
drops to
an unprecedented 3%.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.811
This puts the president
four points below

04:28.978 --> 04:31.647
"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature."

04:31.814 --> 04:33.649
Meanwhile,
the Canadian Prime Minister,

04:33.816 --> 04:36.777
Justin Trudeau, called upon
Canadians to stand strong.

04:36.944 --> 04:40.239
Make no mistake, America.

04:40.406 --> 04:42.658
If you do not hand over
your president,

04:42.825 --> 04:45.286
there will be war the likes
of which you have never seen.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.289
Canadians
will rise together.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.041
<i>I call on all Canadians
here and abroad</i>

04:51.208 --> 04:53.460
<i>to stand
with their country.</i>

04:53.627 --> 04:56.297
<i>The U.S. President
must answer for his crime.</i>

04:56.463 --> 04:59.591
<i>And only Canada
can bring him to justice.</i>

05:08.017 --> 05:10.561
There, there, Tweek.
Everything is gonna be okay.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.647
I saw what I saw, Craig!
You have to believe me!

05:13.814 --> 05:15.566
What's going on?

05:15.733 --> 05:17.484
Tweek's having
a panic attack.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.862
It was real!
He tried to get me!

05:20.029 --> 05:20.863
Who did?

05:21.030 --> 05:23.574
The president!

05:23.741 --> 05:26.702
It's just your
imagination, Tweek.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.038
It's not his imagination.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.373
I saw him, too.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.875
You saw the president?

05:33.042 --> 05:35.127
Out by the quarry,
but I didn't believe it.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.920
I said, "How could
this be --"

05:37.087 --> 05:39.340
The president?
I saw him, too.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.675
He had a blue suit
and an orange face.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.677
He kept asking me,
"How are my --"

05:43.844 --> 05:46.388
"How are
my approval ratings?"

05:46.555 --> 05:48.974
I saw him, too.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.018
Dude, isn't this all
really familiar?

05:51.185 --> 05:52.394
I saw something
just like this

05:52.561 --> 05:54.688
on that show called
"Stranger --"

05:54.855 --> 05:57.524
"Stranger Things."

05:57.691 --> 06:01.320
"Stranger Things" is the show.
I saw it, too.

06:01.487 --> 06:04.073
But wait, isn't
"Stranger Things" just like that movie --

06:04.239 --> 06:05.699
Just like that movie "It."

06:05.866 --> 06:07.576
You saw it, too?

06:07.743 --> 06:09.703
Yeah, I saw it
in the theater.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.539
I saw "Stranger Things"
<i>and</i> "It."

06:14.875 --> 06:16.293
Jesus.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.754
I don't think anyone's
imagining anything.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.631
I think the president
<i>is</i> here.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.174
You kids
get inside somewhere.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.552
I have to warn the town.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.137
Ugh!

06:30.724 --> 06:32.226
All right, people.
People, please.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.645
We need everyone
to try and stay calm.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.355
How can we stay calm
when the president's

06:36.522 --> 06:37.981
out there
scaring our children?!

06:38.148 --> 06:40.526
Look, we all want
the president out of here.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.444
It's just a matter
of how we do it.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.738
I know you all
want to get rid of him.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.448
That's not true.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.991
The Whites still
support the president!

06:48.158 --> 06:50.327
Oh, for fuck's sake,
White, he's running around

06:50.494 --> 06:52.663
eating our pets
and terrorizing our kids!

06:52.830 --> 06:54.581
You think Hillary
would have been any better?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.042
Just sit down, Bob!

06:57.209 --> 06:59.169
I'm just sayin'!
I'm just sayin'!

06:59.336 --> 07:01.672
Listen, everyone.
I have a team right now

07:01.839 --> 07:03.465
that's trying to locate
the president,

07:03.632 --> 07:05.134
and I'd like you to hear
from Officer Bright,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.094
who's leading the search.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.180
Hey, folks.
We know you're all concerned,

07:10.347 --> 07:12.641
but I want to assure you that we
are doing everything we can

07:12.808 --> 07:15.185
to track the president down
and have him safely removed.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.438
Since the president was given
a splatty tomato,

07:17.604 --> 07:20.232
he's become very desperate
and very dangerous.

07:20.399 --> 07:23.318
If you see the president,
do not approach him.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.529
Do not try
to reason with him.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.657
Most importantly, remember
that this <i>is</i> the president,

07:28.824 --> 07:31.076
so you cannot shoot him.
All right?

07:31.243 --> 07:33.370
You can't even talk
about shooting him.

07:33.537 --> 07:34.830
Don't even...

07:34.997 --> 07:37.833
do any coy satirical takes
on shooting him.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.253
Okay, good.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.880
What we're trying to do here

07:43.046 --> 07:44.923
is just get the president
to go away.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.301
We're gonna be handing out
padlocks like this one

07:47.468 --> 07:49.136
so everyone can lock up
their garbage.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.889
If we don't feed the president,
hopefully he'll just move on.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.474
Are there any questions?

07:53.640 --> 07:56.059
Can we talk about
a friend shooting him

07:56.226 --> 07:58.437
if it's in a sort of
a sarcastic way?

07:58.604 --> 08:00.439
No, no, no.
Now, it's - it's just best

08:00.606 --> 08:02.649
to avoid that kind of talk
altogether.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.109
Remember,
they can do to you

08:04.276 --> 08:05.486
what they did
to Kathy Griffin.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.321
Made her not funny
for 30 years?

08:07.488 --> 08:08.906
That's right.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.657
So best thing is just
lock up your garbage

08:10.824 --> 08:13.744
and see if we can get
the president to go away.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.082
Jesus.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.501
Now kids
are going missing.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.127
We're all
gonna be missing soon!

08:24.755 --> 08:26.381
Kyle!

08:27.883 --> 08:29.468
It's my fault.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.887
Ike went to go take matters
into his own hands.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.222
I have to find him.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.140
We'll help you.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.642
We'll all help you.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.519
Guys, this could be
really dangerous.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.062
You're not going.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.772
You promised tonight
we'd have a date night.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.649
Darling, this is a little
more pressing than date night.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.901
Oh, great.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.195
So, Kyle's stupid brother
goes missing, and I get fucked.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.864
How come I'm always the one
getting shit on around here?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.783
I don't need anyone
to go with me.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.535
Oh, what's the matter,
Kyle?

08:54.701 --> 08:55.744
Don't want me around
because you had the hots for me

08:55.911 --> 08:57.746
and I shut you down?

08:57.913 --> 09:01.166
I would never have the hots
for the person you are now.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.543
Come on, you guys.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.419
Look, we all know what
we're supposed to do now.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.713
We all saw "It"
and "Stranger Things."

09:06.880 --> 09:08.840
We need to get our backpacks
and go out to the woods

09:09.007 --> 09:11.635
and save the town from evil
to some kick-ass '80s' music!

09:17.474 --> 09:18.684
Hello, joining us
for lunch today?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.310
Uh, yes.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.979
We are here with
our student of the day

09:22.145 --> 09:23.438
to reward him lunch

09:23.605 --> 09:24.523
with the principal
and vice principal.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.191
We have
a reservation.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.901
Okay, last name?

09:28.068 --> 09:28.944
Woman.

09:29.111 --> 09:31.071
First name.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.198
Strong.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.783
Oh, yes, Strong Woman,
here we are.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.119
We have a nice booth
set up for you.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.456
We can't
keep doing this.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.166
People are gonna
see through it.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.668
Is it my fault
that I found

09:44.835 --> 09:46.503
the most amazing, perfect,
beautiful woman...

09:46.670 --> 09:47.546
at work?

09:47.713 --> 09:49.798
Nobody
will understand.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.133
Maybe they will.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.926
We're co-workers
who are in love.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.470
You really think that's
going to bother people?

09:57.389 --> 09:59.141
Well, should we
order now?

10:13.864 --> 10:14.615
What are you
doing, Bob?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.450
Aah!

10:16.617 --> 10:18.368
Have you been putting food out
for the president?

10:18.535 --> 10:19.995
No, I was just, uh,

10:20.162 --> 10:21.913
taking these finger sandwiches
to the trash.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.791
We all agreed not to feed him
so he'd go away.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.960
We didn't all agree!
<i>You</i> all agreed!

10:27.127 --> 10:29.046
Nobody asked the Whites
how they felt!

10:29.212 --> 10:31.089
Nobody cares what the Whites
have to say!

10:31.256 --> 10:32.841
Bob, come on.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.801
You have to know it's not safe
to have him here.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.054
In 2003,
Hillary Clinton admitted

10:37.220 --> 10:38.639
to taking funds
for her foundation

10:38.805 --> 10:40.432
from foreign diplomats!

10:40.599 --> 10:42.392
What's that got to do
with anything, Bob? Come on.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.186
It's fucking true!

10:44.353 --> 10:47.272
Bob, if Canada finds out
the president is hiding here,

10:47.439 --> 10:49.358
they are going
to nuke us.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.068
He needs to go.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.445
Hillary wouldn't have been
any better.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.406
Give me
the finger sandwiches.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.116
Fine!

10:58.283 --> 11:00.035
Go ahead and take
the White's sandwiches!

11:00.202 --> 11:02.537
They've taken
everything else!

Honey, what are you doing?

11:48.083 --> 11:49.584
This is the place --

11:49.751 --> 11:53.547
This is the place where I
ended it all, remember?

11:53.714 --> 11:55.298
This is where
I threw my phone off the bridge

11:55.465 --> 11:57.300
and quit Twitter for good.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.678
I was so different then...

11:59.845 --> 12:03.098
so naive and hopeful.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.600
Yes, honey, now,
can we get going, please?

12:05.767 --> 12:08.353
I'm sorry! I'm trying to have
a moment here!

12:08.520 --> 12:11.732
This is where our whole
relationship started, asshole!

12:11.898 --> 12:13.650
Yes, it's very touching,
sweetheart.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.318
I love you so much.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.696
I'm sorry
about this, you guys.

12:17.863 --> 12:21.158
I remember feeling

Don't tell me you haven't gotten
the president out of here.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.085
We haven't gotten
the president out of here.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.795
And there's some worse news.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.714
A bunch of kids
have gone missing.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.008
- What?
- I think we have to assume

12:38.175 --> 12:40.343
that the president has...
eaten them.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.764
Why are you here
talking to me

12:43.930 --> 12:45.766
instead of trying
to find the president?!

12:45.932 --> 12:48.852
Don't worry, we're close.
He's out in the woods somewhere.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.396
And we've set up a fox trap.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.190
A fox trap?

13:10.582 --> 13:12.626
Oh, Fox News...

13:12.793 --> 13:14.252
They'll listen to me.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.254
They'll get my side

13:21.218 --> 13:22.719
It's a trap!

13:22.886 --> 13:23.970

13:24.137 --> 13:28.975
It's a Fox trap,

14:19.484 --> 14:21.528
Isn't this the place
you brought me before?

smashed your phone

14:22.988 --> 14:24.114

I felt so bad for you.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.869
We used to sit in the park
and talk for hours.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.787
How come we never do that
anymore?

14:30.954 --> 14:32.581
Oh, fuck. Here we go.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.040
Here we go what?!

14:34.207 --> 14:36.001
You used to be
so nice to me.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.419
You used to be nice to me!

14:37.586 --> 14:39.045
I tried!

14:39.212 --> 14:40.547
But then you started
rolling your eyes

14:40.714 --> 14:42.674
every time I tried to talk to you!
- Ughhh...

14:42.841 --> 14:44.050
He's not here either.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.552
Dude, maybe your brother

14:45.719 --> 14:46.887
didn't even go looking
for the president.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.972
You don't understand
Canadians.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.391
They're fiercely loyal
to their country.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.020
When Canada is attacked,
they all join in the fight.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.883
Randy! Randy!

15:25.050 --> 15:26.176
What?
They got him!

15:26.343 --> 15:28.094
They found the president!

15:30.263 --> 15:32.557
We found his hideout.
There.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.396
Someone's gotta
go flush him out.

15:38.563 --> 15:39.814
I'll be ready to trap him.

15:39.981 --> 15:40.899
I'll do it.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.150
Hey, hey!

15:42.317 --> 15:43.985
Just remember
he's been eating animals

15:44.152 --> 15:46.237
and living like a monster.
Just...

15:46.404 --> 15:48.907
prepare yourself
for what you're about to see.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.670

this place too...

17:07.777 --> 17:10.822
This is where you brought me
on Halloween. Remember?

17:10.989 --> 17:12.532
Yes, darling,
wasn't it romantic?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.284
No!
It wasn't romantic.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.870
There was a witch and you had me
dress up like Gretel and...

17:17.037 --> 17:19.289
you were trying

anything!

17:35.472 --> 17:37.348
Heidi, I think spooky walk
in the woods

17:37.515 --> 17:38.933
is making you lose it
a little bit.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.018

17:47.233 --> 17:51.071

18:00.622 --> 18:02.332

18:02.499 --> 18:04.167
She would have called
by now.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.794
I just talked
to the McKormicks.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.670

since yesterday.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.259

18:19.808 --> 18:22.310

What did you find?

18:22.477 --> 18:24.729

Ugh...

18:24.896 --> 18:27.065
Tell me!
You have to tell me!

18:31.861 --> 18:33.530
Oh, God.
What did you see?!

18:33.696 --> 18:35.406
You don't want to know.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.700
You have to tell me!
I can take it!

18:37.867 --> 18:39.702
Did you find
our son's arm?

18:39.869 --> 18:44.207
Did you find him
torn apart? What?!

18:44.374 --> 18:48.920

are, like...together.

18:49.087 --> 18:52.132
Aww!

19:09.858 --> 19:11.484
It's the president!

19:15.572 --> 19:17.532
Ike! Kyle!

19:17.699 --> 19:19.534
Stan, you're okay!

19:19.701 --> 19:20.994
Yeah, we're okay!

19:21.161 --> 19:23.538
We got him.
We got the son of a bitch.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.331

19:25.498 --> 19:29.669
Everyone back! Do it now!
Get over here, family!

19:29.836 --> 19:33.256
Bob, for the love of Pete, our
country is about to go to war!

19:33.423 --> 19:34.591
You wanna know
where there's a war?!

19:34.757 --> 19:36.342
There's a war on
Christmas!

19:36.509 --> 19:37.886

19:44.809 --> 19:46.769
He's not
saving Christmas, Bob.

19:46.936 --> 19:47.979
He's running around,
scaring your kids,

19:48.146 --> 19:49.772
and shitting in the woods.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.901
Come on, Bob.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.903
What's best for your daughter?
I mean, really?

19:56.362 --> 20:00.158
You piece of shit!
This was all your fault!

20:00.325 --> 20:02.410
You controlled me
and manipulated me

20:02.577 --> 20:04.287
and turned me into this!

20:04.454 --> 20:06.706
Baby, put down the gun,
sweetheart, okay?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.792
I used to be kind.
I used to be caring.

20:09.959 --> 20:15.173
But then you -- you...

20:15.340 --> 20:18.176
No.
Not you.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.179
Me.
I did this.

20:21.346 --> 20:25.391
I let being a victim
become a way of life.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.686
If you always
make yourself the victim,

20:28.853 --> 20:31.439
you can justify
being awful.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.191
Eric...

20:33.358 --> 20:34.692
I'm sorry.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.694
I'm breaking up with you.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.072
Honey, don't be
ridiculous.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.241
I've been ridiculous.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.993
I have to learn to stop
feeling sorry for myself.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.454
Heidi, you are not
breaking up with me.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.290
Yes, I am.
It's over.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.542
I'm afraid I can't let you
do that, sweetheart!

20:51.709 --> 20:53.962
Step back!
I'll do it! I swear to God!

20:54.128 --> 20:55.630
It's not gonna work
this time, Eric.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.674
You break up with me,
I will kill myself!

20:57.840 --> 20:59.008
The choice
is yours, Heidi!

20:59.175 --> 21:00.301
Come on, everybody!

21:00.468 --> 21:02.303
"Eric,
we don't want you to die."

21:02.470 --> 21:03.930
I'm sorry.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.265
You can be the victim.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.307
I can't.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.101
Heidi!

21:08.268 --> 21:10.270
Heidi, I'm gonna do it!
Here we go!

21:10.436 --> 21:12.105
Heidi?!
Are you seriously --

21:15.692 --> 21:17.443
He broke free.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.446
The president
is on the loose again.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.865

even more desperate now.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.826

21:27.453 --> 21:29.747
I don't know.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.666
I guess...

21:31.833 --> 21:33.251
it's up to the Whites.
