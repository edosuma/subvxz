08:38.151 --> 08:41.819
Want to go
back out to the scene?

08:41.854 --> 08:43.888
- For the purpose of?

08:43.923 --> 08:45.991
- I want to take
another look around.

08:59.672 --> 09:00.905
If the concrete struck the car

09:00.940 --> 09:01.940
as it passed under the bridge,

09:01.975 --> 09:02.841
would've continued on a ways

09:02.876 --> 09:05.577
before it hit the curb
and started rolling.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.085
- Think a piece might have
fallen and hit the windshield?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.920
- Maybe.

09:15.955 --> 09:19.791
Or somebody threw it.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.961
I have a dimmer view
of humanity than you.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.718
Son of a bitch.

09:56.095 --> 09:56.127
.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.295
- Hey, brett...

09:57.331 --> 09:59.030
- Oh, cruz, don't!
- What you doing?

09:59.065 --> 10:00.298
- Oh!

10:00.333 --> 10:01.766
- Get out of the way!

10:01.801 --> 10:04.268
- What?
What the hell!

10:04.303 --> 10:06.070
- You see what I mean?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.206
- Yeah, I do.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.743
- What are you doing?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.977
- I mean, look at it.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.146
Compare this to the chunk that
came through the windshield.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.280
Do you guys even have that one?

10:16.315 --> 10:17.481
- Yes, we have that.

10:17.516 --> 10:20.385
But you can't pull prints
off a rough surface like this.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.986
- This is beyond messed up.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.988
- It's awful.
[knocking on door]

10:24.023 --> 10:25.222
- chief, marcy said
you're looking for me?

10:25.258 --> 10:28.092
- Lieutenant kelly severide,
lead firefighter on the scene.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.227
Lieutenant rosin.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.662
- Luke rosin, major accidents.

10:30.697 --> 10:31.763
- What's going on?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.399
- That crash wasn't an accident.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.234
Somebody dropped
a chunk of concrete

10:36.269 --> 10:37.969
onto the car from the overpass.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.370
- On purpose?
You kidding me?

10:39.405 --> 10:42.340
- We're not sure about
anything yet, all right?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.242
- Look at this.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.277
You can see he was
practicing his shots,

10:46.312 --> 10:47.278
trying to get his timing right.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.080
He just waits for a car
to come by and then he--

10:49.115 --> 10:50.448
- look, I agree
it looks that way, all right,

10:50.483 --> 10:51.315
but we need more to go on.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.117
Did you guys talk to
anyone on the scene

10:53.152 --> 10:54.385
who actually witnessed
the accident?

10:54.420 --> 10:55.319
- No.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.055
- Most the people
came out of their houses

10:57.090 --> 10:58.256
when they heard the car crash.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.991
- I know the driver's
in an induced coma,

11:00.026 --> 11:01.392
but did she say
anything on the scene?

11:01.427 --> 11:03.461
- She was unconscious
when we arrived.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.464
- What about the, um--oh, gosh--
there was a little boy.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.132
Um.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.134
Oh, gosh, sean, or...

11:10.169 --> 11:12.136
- You mean zach?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.705
- Right.
Sorry.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.006
Sean's a different incident.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.441
I got three open cases
right now.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.242
Did zach--did he see anything?

11:18.277 --> 11:20.011
- He was in the back
reading a comic.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.447
He--he said he heard
a loud noise and--

11:22.482 --> 11:24.082
suddenly the car was rolling.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.150
- Officer rosin,

11:25.185 --> 11:28.419
these other accidents
that you're investigating,

11:28.454 --> 11:32.457
are they really
more pressing than this one?

11:32.492 --> 11:35.326
- This just became my priority,
all right?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.862
And I'm gonna do my best
to catch this individual.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.469
- Does it still qualify
as a miracle baby

11:44.504 --> 11:46.471
if the whole thing
was caused by some sociopath

11:46.506 --> 11:48.806
that's attacking
innocent people at random?

11:48.841 --> 11:51.042
- Of course it does.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.878
- Heck, it's even more
of a miracle, considering.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.179
- Poor mother.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.481
[alarm blares]

11:56.516 --> 11:58.316
<i> - ambulance 61.</i>
<i> Sick person.</i>

11:58.351 --> 12:00.184
<i> 9570 paulina street.</i>

12:00.219 --> 12:01.318
- Paulina street?

12:01.354 --> 12:03.454
Sounds like gerald forgot
to take his medication again.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.455
- If that's all it is, fine.

12:04.490 --> 12:07.726
I can't handle another
rough call right now.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.161
- Knock knock.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.130
- Tamara.
Hey.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.231
You're not here to yell at me

12:13.266 --> 12:14.766
about that school bus again,
are you?

12:14.801 --> 12:15.833
I thought it was
delivered already.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.201
- It was, last week.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.103
- Oh.
- Thank you very much.

12:19.138 --> 12:22.173
No, I'm here about a gentleman
named max schlottman.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.341
- [exhales]
- you know him?

12:23.376 --> 12:24.409
- I sure do.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.443
- Well, he keeps coming by
the community center,

12:25.478 --> 12:29.847
asking me why you won't
respond to his calls.

12:29.882 --> 12:32.483
- Tamara, when you
badgered me into politics,

12:32.518 --> 12:35.119
how come you didn't warn me
about people like schlottman?

12:35.154 --> 12:36.788
- What kind of people
are we talking about?

12:36.823 --> 12:37.855
- You know.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.158
The crazies.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.361
- Matt, when you're an alderman,
here's the thing.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.229
You don't get to pick
your constituents.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.397
They pick you.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.499
- Listen, I don't know what
the guy's issue is this week,

12:48.534 --> 12:50.268
but whatever it is,

12:50.303 --> 12:52.503
I'm sure there's nothing
I can do about it.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.173
- Well, all I'm asking is
that you hear him out first

12:55.208 --> 12:58.109
before you make
that determination.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.210
- Okay.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.512
I'll reach out.

13:01.547 --> 13:02.914
- Thank you.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.516
- Yeah.

13:07.253 --> 13:10.121
- So, uh, these just need
your awesome signatures.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.490
- You got it.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.491
Oh.
- Yeah.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.559
- [imitates explosion]

13:14.594 --> 13:16.194
- we're really excited,
you know.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.362
Thank you for looping us in.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.264
- Cool, cool, you guys are
making a super smart investment.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.833
- So are we locked into
these drink deals

13:21.868 --> 13:23.501
where we have to
offer everyone half off?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.536
- That's how we draw a crowd.

13:25.571 --> 13:26.938
But you'll get
so many customers,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.240
you'll make it back in spades,
trust me.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.143
- Uh-huh, and how many people
are signed up so far?

13:32.178 --> 13:33.411
- Oh, don't worry
about advanced sales.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.613
Everybody just
signs up same day.

13:35.648 --> 13:40.418
So all I need is
to collect that buy-in fee.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.186
- Okay.
500 bucks, right?

13:42.221 --> 13:43.120
- Yeah, you got it.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.857
Plus, everybody chips in
for marketing costs,

13:45.892 --> 13:49.627
which is an additional 2,200.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.863
- What?

13:51.898 --> 13:53.231
- Well, that's pretty steep.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.199
- Marketing is everything
in bar crawls.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.868
I mean, you've seen the posters.

13:56.903 --> 13:57.935
We do it up right.

13:57.970 --> 13:58.970
- They are great posters.

13:59.005 --> 13:59.904
- Yeah, plus we put ads

13:59.940 --> 14:02.306
on all the best
chicago nightlife websites.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.208
- That's good thinking.

14:04.243 --> 14:05.443
- Herrmann.
- What?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.445
- Hey, it's a great event.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.280
I think it's worth it.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.349
- Yeah.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.584
It's an investment,
like the man says.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.620
I say we do it.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.322
You in?

14:18.357 --> 14:19.557
- Come on, otis.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.659
- Come on.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.194
- Fine.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.930
- All right, trust me,
this is going to be

14:25.965 --> 14:29.267
the biggest drunken mile yet.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.236
- It's gonna be great.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.437
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

14:33.472 --> 14:34.538
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.609
Oh, awesome, awesome.
- Yeah.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.480
- It's funny,
I--I feel okay now.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.547
- Well, we came
all the way here,

14:43.582 --> 14:44.649
so you're getting looked at.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.450
- Gerald,
what's the matter, hon?

14:46.485 --> 14:47.685
- Hi, doris.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.520
- He was complaining
of chest pains.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.956
We did a 12-lead.
Everything checked out okay.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.457
- Still, he thought
better safe than sorry.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.525
- Can never be too cautious.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.327
Let's get you in a room, gerald.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.428
- [clears throat]

14:57.463 --> 14:59.297
- hey, dawson.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.564
Catch a good run?

15:00.599 --> 15:02.233
- Eh, not really.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.534
We had one of
our frequent flyers

15:03.569 --> 15:04.802
who was complaining
of chest pains.

15:04.837 --> 15:08.072
Think he just wanted a free ride
to fill out his prescriptions.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.440
- It's like we're
uber drivers or something.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.975
- [laughs] yeah.

15:11.010 --> 15:11.842
What about you guys?

15:11.878 --> 15:14.512
- Nasty car wreck.
Girl might lose a leg.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.646
But she could have died.

15:15.681 --> 15:16.981
Good samaritan

15:17.016 --> 15:19.417
stopped the bleeding
till we got there.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.389
- Hey!
You!

15:26.659 --> 15:29.460
Hey!
- Sir, wait!

15:30.596 --> 15:32.063
- Whoa-whoa-whoa,
what's wrong?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.332
- It's him.
The guy who found the baby.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.034
- What?

15:49.414 --> 15:49.614
.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.215
- It's the same guy
from this morning, no question.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.149
Tell me that's a coincidence.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.752
He happens to witness
two terrible accidents

15:54.787 --> 15:57.088
in the same day?
No chance.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.556
- You didn't get his name?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.658
- Well, I was busy
trying to save a patient.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.592
I don't understand.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.761
He kept that girl alive
till we got there,

16:03.796 --> 16:06.630
then he followed us here
to make sure she was okay.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.065
It doesn't seem like
the kind of guy who'd

16:08.100 --> 16:09.767
try to hurt someone on purpose.

16:09.802 --> 16:14.171
- Mm, you know, sounds a lot
like "hero syndrome" to me.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.774
There are a lot of
documented cases

16:16.809 --> 16:20.111
of individuals who create
these desperate situations

16:20.146 --> 16:22.179
so they can come along
and fix them.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.615
You know, a nurse
who arrives just in time

16:24.650 --> 16:28.552
or a night watchman
looking for his 15 minutes.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.054
So I'm just saying,
if it turns out to be

16:30.089 --> 16:31.722
your friend in the--
in the motorcycle jacket

16:31.757 --> 16:33.791
who's causing
all these accidents,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.192
funnily enough
from his perspective,

16:35.227 --> 16:36.393
it's got very little
to do with malice.

16:36.428 --> 16:40.197
You know, he just wants
to save the day, be a big hero.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.233
- That is really demented.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.367
- Yeah.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.569
Not really the expression
that we shrinks like to use,

16:45.604 --> 16:47.305
but, um, I hear ya.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.109
- Moto stars.

16:52.144 --> 16:52.976
- What's that?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.379
- It--it's a patch
he had on his jacket.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.681
It said "moto stars,"
I'm pretty sure.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.683
- I'll add that
to his description.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.620
"moto stars patch."

17:02.655 --> 17:04.555
okay, I'm gonna check
the security tapes,

17:04.590 --> 17:07.091
and, uh, let you guys
know what I find.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.726
- Check the
parking lot tapes too.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.094
If he parked his bike out back,

17:10.129 --> 17:11.829
maybe you can get the tags.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.197
- Smart idea, dawson.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.633
[soft scoff]
thank you.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.776
- Oh, my god.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.578
- What?

17:27.613 --> 17:29.780
You okay?

17:29.815 --> 17:31.715
- That miracle baby.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.619
She didn't just miraculously
tumble into that sewer.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.389
He put her there.

17:38.424 --> 17:41.692
- To make sure he was
the only one who could find her.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.327
- He caused the wreck,

17:43.362 --> 17:45.596
saw that little girl
thrown from her car seat,

17:45.631 --> 17:48.332
and for all he knew,
she could have had spinal trauma
