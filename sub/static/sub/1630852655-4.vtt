WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:03.120
- I'm nearly there!
- We've gotta go!

00:03.200 --> 00:04.960
- Don't go!
- Get off!

00:05.040 --> 00:07.240
Get down!

00:07.320 --> 00:10.320
(suspenseful music)

00:12.480 --> 00:14.440
- I'm scared that next
time I step up to a device

00:14.520 --> 00:15.640
I'm not gonna know what I'm doing.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.360
- You've just lost your
mate. Give yourself a break.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.520
- [Thom] Who's that?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.960
- Uh, it's just Danny. Some stupid GIF.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.400
- You know, I've been
thinking about it for a while.

00:24.480 --> 00:28.040
Might be an idea for you to
move in here with me, you know.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.680
- [Lana] You working?

00:29.760 --> 00:31.440
- Is he bollocks.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.520
- It's just tough at the minute.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.560
- Look at the bloody state of you.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.320
A halal butcher's?

00:39.400 --> 00:40.640
- Don't mention this to Mum and Dad.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.720
- [Lana] What are you doing, Billy?

00:41.800 --> 00:43.560
- We're at war, Lana.
- You haven't got a clue.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.160
What do you know about war?

00:45.240 --> 00:48.680
- Single bombing campaign run
by one group: the Crusaders.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.800
We know at least one member
of the cell, Nic Roberts.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.160
- Nic Roberts didn't have
bomb-making training.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.960
There's another member of
the cell: the bomb maker.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.640
- It's HMX-319.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.560
- How the hell are the bombers

00:59.640 --> 01:01.000
getting military-grade explosive?

01:01.080 --> 01:02.560
- [Hamilton] What does the CCTV

01:02.640 --> 01:03.720
from the tower block tell us?

01:03.800 --> 01:05.080
- [Thom] This is him leaving the building.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.920
From there he gets into a white Prius.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.080
But we're still searching for the vehicle.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.760
- Look at this from the
first device at Westhaven.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.880
It's the same technique.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.320
- It's military training.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.160
They know call-out times, how we think,

01:18.240 --> 01:20.240
how we move, everything.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.040
It's got to be an inside man.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.400
(shutter clicks)

01:35.000 --> 01:37.600
(gulls cawing)

01:40.800 --> 01:43.080
- [Newscaster] The suspect
shot dead in the terror attack

01:43.160 --> 01:45.000
at the Five Oaks Pub in London

01:45.080 --> 01:47.520
has been named today as Nicholas Roberts,

01:47.600 --> 01:49.440
a former member of the English Flag.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.320
Counter-terror police are appealing

01:51.400 --> 01:53.920
for anyone with information
to come forward.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.200
This attempt on an LGBT venue

01:56.280 --> 01:58.680
follows attacks by the so-called Crusaders

01:58.760 --> 02:01.960
on the Amburiq Mosque
and Westhaven Estate.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.920
(pensive music)

02:06.000 --> 02:08.840
- [Sam] Speak to the jogger.
Find out if she saw anything.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.600
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.800
- Okay.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.960
- Prelim report from forensics
says there's no fingerprints,

02:15.040 --> 02:16.800
no evidence of the second Crusader,

02:16.880 --> 02:18.400
but the vehicle make and model

02:18.480 --> 02:22.040
match the one detected on
CCTV leaving Fairhall Tower.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.280
Plates were taken and the
VIN removed from the chassis.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.440
- [Thom] So the guy's
a pro. What about CCTV?

02:28.520 --> 02:29.480
- We're in a black hole here.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.920
That's why it's so popular with doggers.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.160
- We didn't lucky to find some couple?

02:34.240 --> 02:35.680
- No one that's likely to come forward.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.600
- [Sonya] Detectives.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.360
- [Sam] Sonya, anything useful?

02:38.440 --> 02:39.200
- [Sonya] Well, from the blast pattern

02:39.280 --> 02:40.680
and the intense local burning,

02:40.760 --> 02:42.040
looks like some sort of accelerant

02:42.120 --> 02:43.520
was used for the interior.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.680
Hey.
- Hi.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.720
- [Sonya] And then a det
charge on the petrol tank.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.320
- [Sam] So our man isn't
taking any chances.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.200
- [Lana] What kind of accelerant?

02:50.280 --> 02:51.800
- [Sonya] Well, I'll do a deep dive,

02:51.880 --> 02:53.720
but I'd say good old petrol.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.840
There's nothing exotic to trace.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.200
- So the use of a det charge,

02:56.280 --> 02:58.360
does that suggest he
could be the bomb maker?

02:58.440 --> 03:00.040
- Well, you can teach
anyone to use a det charge.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.160
It's making it that's harder.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.440
- Okay, I'm gonna head back to Five Oaks.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.160
Is there anything else?
- No.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.440
When I get a report on the accelerant

03:06.520 --> 03:08.520
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.360
- Can I have a word?
- Yeah.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.400
- So, how are we getting on?

03:13.480 --> 03:15.200
The HMX? Porton Down?

03:15.280 --> 03:17.480
- Uh, I've sent it on.
We're looking at it.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.640
- Well, I think this will speed things up.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.160
That's how professionals tie their wires.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.920
- Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
- Well, we found the same
pattern in all three devices.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.160
- And that's why you think it
was one bomber for all three?

03:41.040 --> 03:43.200
- I found that in John Hudson's locker.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.520
- What are you doing in his locker, Lana?

03:47.600 --> 03:48.760
Christ.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.680
It's a breach of confidence,

03:49.760 --> 03:51.600
not to mention it makes
any evidence inadmissible.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.640
- Yeah, obviously I know
that. Just hear me out, yeah?

03:54.720 --> 03:56.040
Hidden in the back of his locker

03:56.120 --> 03:58.840
is an A-Z of London
covering these locations:

03:58.920 --> 04:02.280
Five Oaks Pub, Westhaven, Amburiq Mosque.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.240
Come on, Thom. Are you
gonna help me or not?

04:06.320 --> 04:08.320
- Yeah, all right. Okay.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.960
You did the right thing,
bringing this to me. I'll, uh...

04:14.040 --> 04:14.800
I'll take care of it.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.920
- Right, well, I'll text you the pictures.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.680
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.360
I'll see you in a bit.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.080
(ominous music)

04:31.680 --> 04:34.680
(suspenseful music)

04:45.240 --> 04:47.640
(Lana sighs)

04:50.960 --> 04:53.480
(phone rings)

04:56.840 --> 04:57.680
Hello?

04:57.760 --> 04:59.240
- [Man] Hi, is that Lana Washington?

04:59.320 --> 05:00.080
- Yeah, speaking.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.600
- [Man] This is DC Jones.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.880
Your brother William has failed to attend

05:02.960 --> 05:05.760
a further interview at
Holloway Police Station.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.600
- He's not turned up?

05:06.680 --> 05:08.320
There's not much I can
do about that, sorry.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.240
- [Jones] It's in his
best interest to cooperate

05:10.320 --> 05:11.840
with these additional inquiries.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.760
If he doesn't-
- No. No, no, it's fine.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.240
I'll bring him in myself. Okay.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.640
- [Jones] Okay, thank you.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.080
- Thanks, bye.
- Goodbye.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.160
- [Lana] God's sake.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.440
- [Billy's Voicemail]
Eh up, it's Billy. Um...

05:27.520 --> 05:29.480
Leave me a message. I'll get back to you.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.800
- Billy, I'm at your flat.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.280
You were meant to have an
appointment with the police today.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.360
(doorbell buzzes)

05:36.440 --> 05:38.440
Billy!

05:39.480 --> 05:43.560
Will you call me? I ain't
got time for this shit.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.400
- The situation with the
far right in this country

05:48.480 --> 05:50.480
is very fluid.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.640
When Agatha Jack attempted to
reform English Flag last year

05:54.720 --> 05:56.800
there were 100 expulsions from the party

05:56.880 --> 05:58.840
for extremist views.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.800
Names on a list that were
easy for us to monitor.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.840
So we think the far right changed tactics.

06:04.920 --> 06:08.280
They started to look at people
without criminal convictions

06:08.360 --> 06:12.760
or a history of far right
activism, clean skins,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.360
to target the disillusioned,

06:16.440 --> 06:19.560
the unemployed, the left behind,

06:19.640 --> 06:21.640
and to groom them for political ends.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.680
- So to restate our current thinking,

06:26.760 --> 06:28.400
the initial attack on Westhaven

06:28.480 --> 06:31.720
was a false flag
operation by the Crusaders

06:31.800 --> 06:35.160
to justify their attack
on the Amburiq Mosque.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.760
Andrew Phelan was chosen
as the unwilling victim

06:37.840 --> 06:40.080
for the Westhaven attack
because Nic Roberts

06:40.160 --> 06:42.600
had some kind of personal
grudge against him.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.840
Do we know what that was?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.640
- From our interviews with Phelan

06:45.720 --> 06:48.640
we've established that
Roberts mistakenly believed

06:48.720 --> 06:51.360
Phelan had been deliberately
placed in his cell by MI5

06:51.440 --> 06:53.440
to gather intel on the far right.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
- We're working through
a database of suspects

06:56.080 --> 06:59.280
supplied by Thames House that
had history with Nic Roberts,

06:59.360 --> 07:03.400
and examining CCTV and comms
for any new associations.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.000
We've had the preliminary
results of Nic Roberts autopsy,

07:08.080 --> 07:10.120
and it seems that he was
in the advanced stages

07:10.200 --> 07:11.920
of terminal prostate cancer,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.080
which might explain why he was prepared

07:14.160 --> 07:16.160
to act as a suicide bomber.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.000
- Lana, I read your
report on the Five Oaks.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.040
Again, well done.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.680
You seem certain that we're
looking for the same bombers

07:23.760 --> 07:25.760
for all three attacks.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.680
- Uh, no sir, not certain.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.440
But I think it's highly
likely that we're looking

07:29.520 --> 07:31.520
for just one bomber.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.440
We've identified three distinct elements.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.600
One, the chemical composition
of the device, HMX-319.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.360
Which has been reported as
classified at Porton Down.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.600
- [Thom] Uh, we're tracing that now, sir.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.200
Working theory is that
some of the explosive

07:50.280 --> 07:52.280
found its way on to the dark web.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.560
- Two, the method of delivery:

07:54.640 --> 07:57.120
the repeated use of secondaries.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.960
And three,

07:59.040 --> 08:00.840
with the reconstruction of the devices

08:00.920 --> 08:02.360
we've been able to identify

08:02.440 --> 08:04.360
a distinct signature in the wiring.

08:04.440 --> 08:09.160
- And does that tell us
anything about the bomb maker?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.800
- That they've had
high-level military training.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.440
- This considerably
raises the threat level.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.920
- I've got an example
here from the device.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.320
- May I?

08:23.400 --> 08:26.400
- That technique is durable.
It prevents snagging.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.360
An EXPO can quickly check for damage

08:29.440 --> 08:31.960
without pulling the whole thing apart.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.440
This is not something just anyone can do.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.800
- When was this report submitted, Thom?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.640
- Ms. Washington only made
the discovery about the wiring

08:39.720 --> 08:40.760
earlier today, ma'am.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.840
We're now looking through
official databases

08:42.920 --> 08:46.080
to see if we can identify
any persons of interest.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.000
We're keeping an open mind.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.880
We're looking at former
English Flag members

08:49.960 --> 08:51.760
who may have had some level of training.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.120
TA, paramilitary.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.440
- Lana, I'm not doubting that
you recognise this technique,

08:56.520 --> 08:58.160
but why would the bombers choose

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
to advertise who they were so clearly?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.560
Unless it's a ruse to throw us off track.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.200
- The false flag attack at Westhaven

09:04.280 --> 09:06.200
shows they use misdirection.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.240
- Finishing a wire like
this is second nature.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.480
You just do it without thinking.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.520
The bombers obviously didn't
expect us to check the wiring.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.720
The circuit's usually
damaged in the blast.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.280
I'm absolutely certain
the bomber's military.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.720
(ominous music)

09:27.640 --> 09:28.480
(knock at door)

09:28.560 --> 09:30.640
Billy? Wake up!

09:30.720 --> 09:32.720
What a shit tip.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.600
It's that one.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.960
- Oh, right.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.040
- [Val] Where is the birthday boy?

09:39.640 --> 09:41.200
- [Lana] I'll wake the lazy sod up.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.240
- Oh, look.
- Billy?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.840
- [Jeff] He started the party without us.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.920
- Looks like it.
- Jeez.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.840
- [Lana] Well that's
typical. He's not here.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.800
- (sighs) I told you we
should have called first.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.200
(Val groans)

09:53.280 --> 09:56.360
- Well, he's obviously had people round.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.480
- [Val] Maybe him and Becky have gone out

09:57.560 --> 09:58.960
for a birthday surprise.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.920
- No, I doubt it, Mum.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.120
Think them two have split up for good now.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.920
- [Val] What? He never said.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.120
- Well, he wouldn't, would he?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.680
- [Jeff] Hmm, his car's gone and all.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.520
- Oh, that's a shame about Becky.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
How did he seem when you last saw him?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.560
- Uh, mardy?

10:16.640 --> 10:17.840
Confused?

10:17.920 --> 10:19.520
- No change there, then.
- No.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.160
(Jeff chuckles)

10:22.240 --> 10:24.800
- Bloody hell, what's that?

10:24.880 --> 10:26.560
- It's a bandage.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.080
He cut his hand a couple of days ago.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.960
- When?
- A couple of days ago.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.560
(Val scoffs)

10:33.640 --> 10:36.400
(sighs) It was after Nut's funeral.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.360
He got absolutely battered.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.560
He'd had too much to drink,

10:39.640 --> 10:41.960
and he ended up smashing a
window and he got arrested-

10:42.040 --> 10:43.120
- Arrested?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.280
- Yes, Dad.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.240
But he didn't want you to worry,

10:45.320 --> 10:47.080
so I promised him I wouldn't say.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.840
- You promised him you
wouldn't say anything.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.880
- Mum, come on.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.240
- What's going on?
- Nothing, Mum.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.320
Please, stop worrying.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.280
Billy's not turned up to
his own party. What's new?

10:58.120 --> 11:00.600
- Yeah, it sounds like
his usual dozy self.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.040
- Yeah. Probably nursing
a hangover somewhere.

11:04.120 --> 11:04.880
- [Val] You're off then?

11:04.960 --> 11:06.840
- I'm not gonna stay if he's not here.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.040
- All right.
- I'll see you in a bit.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.120
- Ta-ra, love.
- Ta-ra.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.160
(pensive music)

11:28.360 --> 11:31.120
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.160
- All right?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.600
- Well, I've had better weeks.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.120
- Yeah. I just wanted to
say sorry about your window.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.560
- Bloody idiots. They
were drunk, weren't they?

11:44.480 --> 11:47.360
I've been here my entire life,
love. It's always the same.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.440
Things go wrong, we're an easy target.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.640
- Were you in when it happened?

11:51.720 --> 11:53.600
- Yeah. I sleep up there, don't I?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.280
We heard them staggering down the road,

11:55.360 --> 11:57.360
two in the morning, singing, shouting.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.840
- Look, uh...

12:01.920 --> 12:04.400
Will you let me pay for your window?

12:04.480 --> 12:07.840
- Nah, you're all right.
It's not your fault, is it?

12:07.920 --> 12:10.360
- No, it's not. It's my brother's.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.280
And I'm really ashamed, so please,

12:12.360 --> 12:14.640
will you just let me pay for it?

12:14.720 --> 12:16.200
- No.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.440
Keep your money.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.560
- I'm not trying to offend you. I...

12:19.640 --> 12:21.280
- We don't need anything
from anything you.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.160
- Sorry, can I just ask? You said "them."

12:23.240 --> 12:25.280
Did you say there was more than one guy?

12:25.360 --> 12:27.560
- Well, I can't remember.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.640
You need to leave us alone.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.880
(pensive music)

12:44.720 --> 12:46.760
- Thing to do is not to panic, yeah?

12:46.840 --> 12:48.520
Don't go for some fancy flavour combo

12:48.600 --> 12:50.760
like banana salted caramel.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.320
You'll regret it.
(Lana chuckles)

12:52.400 --> 12:54.560
- I'll just have some of yours then.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.640
- Oh, you will, will you?
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.320
- Thank you.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.080
- So come on. What's up?

13:12.560 --> 13:13.680
I mean, I know hanging out with me

13:13.760 --> 13:15.760
is on your bucket list, love.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.320
Something's wrong. I can tell.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.520
- It's my stupid brother.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.640
He's gone on some bender
and my folks are worried,

13:25.720 --> 13:30.000
so they're giving me
grief, which is all I need.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.920
- Billy's a grown lad, isn't he?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.520
Probably just letting off steam.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.120
- Yeah. He's done it
before, lost weekends.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.040
- But there's more, right?

13:43.080 --> 13:45.440
- After Nut's wake he went
and smashed up the window

13:45.520 --> 13:47.520
at a halal butcher's.

13:48.280 --> 13:51.720
He's been charged with racially
aggravated criminal damage.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.440
- Oh, mate, I...

13:53.520 --> 13:54.600
I don't know what to say.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.680
- Neither do I. It's disgusting.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.080
- I'm not making excuses

14:03.160 --> 14:05.720
for what he's done or anything, but...

14:05.800 --> 14:08.320
Well, he was bloody wasted
that night, wasn't he?

14:08.400 --> 14:11.640
Almost as bad as you. (chuckles)

14:11.720 --> 14:12.640
- According to Micky,

14:12.720 --> 14:16.080
him and John started on the
Flaming Sambucas after we left.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.160
Nearly set the bar on fire.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.080
- John? EXPO John?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.600
- Yeah. Micky reckons they were
on it all night, those two.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.680
Said they left together as well.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.440
- Six.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.800
Seven.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.040
Eight.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.720
Nine.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.680
Ten.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.960
- [Danny] Go on, old man.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.880
- [Hass] Mate, you're
up. Go on, you got this.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.200
(John groans)
- One.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.480
Two.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.800
- John? Can I have a quick word, please?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.440
- What's up, Wash?

14:50.520 --> 14:51.680
- You haven't seen Billy around, have you?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.560
He's not been back to his flat.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.880
- Billy who?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.600
- My Billy.
- Oh right, your brother.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.680
No. Why would I have seen him?

14:59.640 --> 15:00.680
- I thought you two were mates.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.240
- Mates?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.720
What are you on about? I
barely said two words to him.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.120
Is that it?

15:09.680 --> 15:11.680
- Yeah, that's it.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.080
(heavy metal music)

15:25.600 --> 15:26.560
- See you later, ladies.
- Later, old man.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.760
- [Hass] See ya.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.000
- [Danny] It's called technique, bro.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.280
- Wash?

15:31.360 --> 15:32.360
How many pull-ups can you do?

15:32.440 --> 15:34.040
- (chuckles) Don't wanna embarrass you.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.120
- Ooh. (laughs)
- Oi!

15:38.560 --> 15:41.560
(suspenseful music)

16:41.280 --> 16:44.040
(sinister music)

16:52.280 --> 16:54.680
(Lana gasps)

17:13.640 --> 17:15.640
Shit.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.080
- [Billy's Voicemail]
Eh up, it's Billy. Um...

17:23.160 --> 17:24.680
Leave me a message, I'll get back to you.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.960
(voicemail beeps)

17:26.040 --> 17:28.280
- Yo. Numpty, it's me.

17:28.360 --> 17:31.280
Where are you? Call me
when you get this, okay?

17:31.360 --> 17:32.640
- Lana!
- Bye.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.240
- What do you think you're playing at?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.360
- What are you doing, following me?

17:36.440 --> 17:38.040
- We've got an individual
under surveillance.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.800
Active surveillance. They
saw you following John.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.320
I had to tell my team not
to include it in the report.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.920
- He was checking out a Jewish centre.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.360
Thom, he's mixed up in all of this.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.680
I can tell you now, he is.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.160
- Look, he's under constant
surveillance, okay?

17:51.240 --> 17:53.600
So just leave the job to us, please.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.680
See you later at work, yeah?

17:56.720 --> 17:59.120
(Lana sighs)

18:03.840 --> 18:05.840
- All right, Wash? Brew?

18:06.240 --> 18:07.600
- Just the man I was after.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.800
I was just thinking about
the Five Oaks attack.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.920
John was on shift that day

18:11.000 --> 18:12.120
but he never turned up to the job.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.520
Hass did.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.800
- Oh, yeah. Remember.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.880
He went home just before the call came in.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.920
Stomach bug, he said.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.920
- Well, that's strange.
Seemed fine when I saw him.

18:22.840 --> 18:23.800
- Do you want a brew?

18:23.880 --> 18:26.040
- Yeah, cheers.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.880
(brooding music)

18:39.440 --> 18:41.360
(sighs) Come on.
(line ringing)

18:41.440 --> 18:42.680
- [Billy's Voicemail]
Eh up, it's Billy. Um...

18:42.760 --> 18:44.360
Leave me a message, I'll get back to you.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.560
(voicemail beeps)

18:45.640 --> 18:46.400
- Hey.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.040
- Hey.
- Who's that?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.720
- Billy. Have you spoken
to John Hudson yet?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.080
- Uh, I can't talk about an
ongoing investigation, Lana.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.560
- [Passerby] Neighbour at number six.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.000
- [Passerby] Yeah, she seems-

18:58.080 --> 18:59.720
- He's hiding something.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.400
I found out that he pulled a sicky

19:01.480 --> 19:03.000
the day of the Five Oaks attack.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.520
He even lied to my face
about knowing Billy.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.720
- If we had anything on him,

19:07.800 --> 19:09.840
do you really think we'd let him on duty?

19:09.920 --> 19:12.120
I'm sorry, Lana. I've
already said too much.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.280
All right, well, have you got the trace

19:13.360 --> 19:15.360
on the military explosives
that you promised me?

19:15.440 --> 19:16.440
- It's ongoing, like I've told you.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.280
- "Ongoing"?

19:17.360 --> 19:18.240
What does that even mean?
- Lana-

19:18.320 --> 19:19.080
- Thom, it's me you're talking to.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.400
- I can't tell you everything.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.520
All right? I've already shared too much.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.520
There's a DCI position opening up

19:25.600 --> 19:27.440
in Serious and Organised
Crime and I just can't afford

19:27.520 --> 19:28.400
to not play it by the book at the minute.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.080
- [Lana] Are you seriously
thinking about your career

19:30.160 --> 19:31.160
at the moment?
- I didn't mean it like that.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.840
- [Lana] Is that all you care about?

19:32.920 --> 19:35.240
- What I'm saying is-
- Oi, oi! Heads up!

19:35.320 --> 19:37.840
- Yes, I will come back
to you on that, Lana.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.360
- All right, Wash?
- What are you lot doing here?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.880
- Same as you. EXPO briefing.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Keep up, mate.

19:43.920 --> 19:44.640
- Come on then, John.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.760
What have you got our Billy mixed up in?

19:49.560 --> 19:51.600
Come on. I know about
the butcher's window.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.560
- No idea what you're talking about.

19:53.640 --> 19:54.800
Where you getting this shit from?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.080
- No one's telling me anything.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.560
Just working it all out for myself.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.480
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.680
(ominous music)

20:03.760 --> 20:05.760
What are you doing? Grooming him?

20:06.520 --> 20:08.360
(John chuckles)

20:08.440 --> 20:10.920
- Lana! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(officers shouting)

20:11.000 --> 20:13.400
- Lana! What the hell's going on?

20:13.480 --> 20:14.920
- [Thom] Jesus Christ!

20:15.000 --> 20:17.400
- Fuck's sake.
- No!

20:17.480 --> 20:18.360
- [John] Fuck's sake!

20:18.440 --> 20:20.080
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.360
- [Hass] What's going on there?

20:22.440 --> 20:25.840
- Do you wish to make a formal
complaint about this officer?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.920
- Stay there.
- No.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.880
No, I'm not like that.
(Lana laughs)

20:29.960 --> 20:32.480
She's had a lot to deal with
lately, what with Nut and that.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.880
Pressure's getting to her.
Isn't that right, Wash?

20:33.960 --> 20:36.160
- Oh, fuck off!
- Lana!

20:36.240 --> 20:38.240
I can't ignore your conduct.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.000
I think you should take
some personal leave.

20:41.080 --> 20:41.840
- What?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.040
You do know that it's him

20:43.120 --> 20:43.880
you need to worry about, don't you?

20:43.960 --> 20:45.360
- It wasn't a request.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.000
Clearly you need some time
away from the front line.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.560
- Oh, this is bullshit!

20:48.640 --> 20:50.240
There's a psycho out there killing people.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.080
What do you want me to do?

20:51.160 --> 20:52.760
Just go home and start
twiddling my thumbs?

20:52.840 --> 20:54.440
- That's my decision.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.800
- Well, with respect,
ma'am, it's bollocks.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.920
Excuse me.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.760
(John laughs)

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
- Hey, leave it.
- Hudson!

21:12.400 --> 21:15.160
(brooding music)

21:42.360 --> 21:45.320
(call rings)

21:45.400 --> 21:46.920
- Wash, hey.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.200
- Hey. Thanks for making time for me.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.880
Like I said, I don't
wanna get you in trouble.

21:51.960 --> 21:52.720
- No, don't worry about it.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.760
I'll help if I can, but
let's make it quick.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.640
- So I've had a thought.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.920
HMX-319, that's what
special forces use, innit?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.400
- [Sonya] Uh, yeah, I believe so.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.320
I mean, that's about as much
as we know from Porton Down.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.920
- All right, well, what's
the lifespan of it?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.480
If we can narrow down the
timescales we can get some dates.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.280
Then maybe we can work
out who'd have access.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.800
- Well...

22:15.880 --> 22:18.400
Depending on storage,
about 50 years I reckon.

22:18.480 --> 22:22.000
The traces we found would
seem to be about 10 years old.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.080
Look, leave this with me and
I'll see if I can find out

22:25.160 --> 22:27.720
about military operations
that used HMX, okay?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.760
Did you get any sleep last night?

22:32.920 --> 22:36.680
- I just can't sit around
waiting for something to happen

22:36.760 --> 22:38.760
while the bomber's out there.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.640
Billy is a pain in the arse.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.520
He's just a magnet for
bullies and wrong 'uns.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.800
I'm just sick of having
to look out for him.

22:46.880 --> 22:47.880
I need to be on duty.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.920
- Mate, you need to take
your mind off things.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.440
- How?

22:53.520 --> 22:57.080
(energetic music thumping)

23:07.920 --> 23:09.640
- Here she is.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.000
Lady of leisure.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.240
- Oh, yeah. You gonna break?

23:13.320 --> 23:15.320
- Uh...

23:15.680 --> 23:17.680
Ladies first.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
- You'll regret that.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.240
He's going for it. Middle pocket.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.720
- Come on, mate. Just caress it home.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.920
Just tickle it.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.160
Ooh! (chuckles) Unlucky!

23:44.240 --> 23:45.960
Sorry, pal. Better luck next time.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.640
(Lana chuckles)

23:48.720 --> 23:50.280
That's why I love coming here.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.360
The vibe, you know?
- Yeah.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.200
- These boys are bloody useless,

23:54.280 --> 23:56.280
but they're having the time of their life.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.120
Yeah, this is all I want.

23:59.560 --> 24:02.320
- What, fizzy pop, crisps,
and being shit at pool?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.560
What a life. (laughs)

24:04.640 --> 24:06.280
- Yeah, you...

24:06.360 --> 24:08.360
I just mean the simple things.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.600
Having a laugh. Mates.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.960
- Yeah, I get it.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.280
And thanks.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.840
- What for?

24:22.920 --> 24:24.920
- For not asking me how I am.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.840
- Well, I'm...

24:28.920 --> 24:31.400
I'm always around, any
time you don't wanna talk.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.920
- So, is that what we are, then? Mates?

24:41.040 --> 24:43.040
- You tell me.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.680
(phone buzzes)

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
Great timing.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.280
Sorry. For kissing you.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.240
- Don't be.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.760
(phone buzzes)

25:14.840 --> 25:16.840
Oh my god.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.160
Hello?

25:19.240 --> 25:22.640
(male caller's voice breaking up)

25:22.720 --> 25:24.920
What? Say that again, I
can't hear you properly.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.120
(male caller's voice breaking up)

25:27.200 --> 25:28.160
What?

25:28.240 --> 25:30.080
- There's bad reception
in here. Best outside.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.040
- (groans) I'll be one minute.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.120
Hang on a sec.

25:37.760 --> 25:38.800
- [Bregman] It's Commander Bregman.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.960
I need to talk to you
about your brother Billy.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.000
Can you hear me?

25:42.080 --> 25:43.640
- Yeah, I can hear you. What's up?

25:43.720 --> 25:46.760
- Listen carefully. This
is a confidential briefing.

25:46.840 --> 25:50.160
Do not repeat it to anyone
unless I authorise you to do so.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.880
- [Lana] Okay.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.960
- We believe your brother is
involved with a Crusaders cell.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.240
We don't know what his involvement is.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.760
It could be low-level,
transporting things around.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.600
We can't be certain yet.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.960
We know he's due in front
of the magistrate's court

26:04.040 --> 26:06.680
on the charge of racially
aggravated criminal damage.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.840
And our investigations
have revealed a link

26:09.920 --> 26:12.160
between Billy and the Crusaders.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.680
We found CCTV evidence of Nic
Roberts meeting with Billy.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.960
Now, I know this is a lot to take in,

26:19.040 --> 26:20.800
but the situation has become critical.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.120
Billy's car has tripped an ANPR camera

26:23.200 --> 26:25.440
and we tracked him
heading into North London.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.080
We need to detain him and
bring him in for questioning.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.360
The Crusaders' next
attack may be imminent.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.080
- I'm sorry, sir, are you
sure you mean my Billy?

26:35.160 --> 26:37.320
- Lana, we have an armed
police response unit

26:37.400 --> 26:38.280
ready to intercept,

26:38.360 --> 26:40.320
but we want you to encourage him

26:40.400 --> 26:42.440
to cooperate calmly and safely.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.560
I'm going to have to push you,
Lana. Will you make the call?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.640
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.120
- DI Desai, do you have
anything else to add?

26:53.200 --> 26:54.480
- Lana, it's Sam.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.160
When we need to
communicate we'll text you.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.440
We need as much information as possible.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.480
Keep him talking, find
out where he's going,

27:00.560 --> 27:03.320
and make him come to Southwark Station.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.160
- He's, um...

27:04.240 --> 27:06.400
He's not been answering my calls, so...

27:06.480 --> 27:08.080
- [Sam] Understood. Um...

27:08.160 --> 27:10.080
From his phone records
he's been making calls

27:10.160 --> 27:11.640
to a Becky Walters.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.040
Several unanswered calls.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.960
- Yep, that's his ex.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.320
- Text him and say you're with Becky

27:16.400 --> 27:17.800
and she wants to speak to him.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.720
Make him call you.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.240
Thom, is the audio recording set up?

27:21.320 --> 27:22.160
- Uh, yeah. Just...

27:22.240 --> 27:24.480
- [Lana] You're recording this?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.320
- Lana, we have to.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.760
(suspenseful music)

27:29.840 --> 27:30.960
- Okay.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.400
- Ready?
- Yeah.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.480
- Okay, everything's ready.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.560
We'll be listening in on a secure line.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.680
- We playing or what?

27:38.760 --> 27:40.760
- Um...

27:44.000 --> 27:46.800
Uh, no, not now. Just...

27:46.880 --> 27:47.640
- What's up?

27:47.720 --> 27:49.720
- I've gotta go. I'm sorry, Karl.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.360
(polices siren wailing)

28:13.200 --> 28:15.800
(phone chimes)

28:22.600 --> 28:25.200
(line ringing)

28:26.320 --> 28:27.320
- [Lana] Billy!

28:27.400 --> 28:29.760
- [Billy] Can you put Becky on?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.160
- Where are you? You
sound like you're driving.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.520
- You should raise the volume.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.520
- [Billy] Yeah, I'm
driving to meet my mates.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.760
Go on, just let me speak to Becky.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.440
- [Lana] What mates? Anyone I know?

28:37.520 --> 28:39.760
- Just mates, Lana.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.600
Why, what's going? Is
she with you or what?

28:41.680 --> 28:42.960
- Listen, Billy, I'm not with Becky.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.200
I just needed you to call me.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.920
- [Billy] You mean you're not
with Becky? What do you mean?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.440
What? Why?
- I need to talk to you.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.960
You've not been answering my calls.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.880
You've not been about. I mean,
where are you driving to?

28:52.960 --> 28:56.200
(protestors clamouring)

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Billy? Billy!

29:00.440 --> 29:02.440
(protestors pounding on car)

29:02.520 --> 29:04.760
- Fucking arsehole!

29:04.840 --> 29:06.360
- Billy! Where exactly are you?

29:06.440 --> 29:08.440
- [Billy] Farringdon tube station.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.080
- [Lana] Sounds busy. What's going on?

29:11.160 --> 29:13.600
- Farringdon tube is near
where the anti-fascist demo

29:13.680 --> 29:15.200
is taking place in Clerkenwell Green.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.880
- What's Billy doing amongst all that lot?

29:17.960 --> 29:19.720
(protestors chanting)

29:19.800 --> 29:22.160
- [Lana] Okay. Well, why are you there?

29:24.800 --> 29:26.080
- [Hamilton] How close
are the armed units?

29:26.160 --> 29:27.120
- Two minutes out.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.280
- [Lana] Billy. Billy?

29:30.840 --> 29:31.840
- Intercept.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.160
- Listen to me. It's important.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.320
What are you doing at Farringdon Station?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.160
- [Billy] I was meant to meet
the lads but they're not here.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.160
Outside the tube, he
said, but I can't see 'em.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.600
Just a load of lefty wankers.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.800
- [Lana] Billy, why did you
drive? Was that your idea?

29:46.880 --> 29:49.040
- No, my mate asked me to give
some of the lads a lift down.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.160
Must be some kind of joke.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.240
(protestors chanting)

29:56.320 --> 29:58.080
Yeah, he's set me up, hasn't he?

29:58.160 --> 30:01.480
They're having a laugh,
aren't they? Knobheads.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.640
- Billy, these new mates of yours,

30:03.720 --> 30:05.720
they're not who you think they are.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.800
- Lana, what are you on about?

30:08.880 --> 30:11.680
- Nic. Nic Roberts, he's a...

30:11.760 --> 30:13.560
He's a terrorist!

30:13.640 --> 30:15.640
One of the Crusaders who killed Nut.

30:17.480 --> 30:18.480
- You're winding me up, aren't you?

30:18.560 --> 30:20.840
- Do I sound like I'm
fucking winding you up?

30:22.040 --> 30:24.000
Have any of them been near your car?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.840
Look around. Is there
anything different about it?

30:25.920 --> 30:26.800
- Eh?

30:26.880 --> 30:28.440
- For fuck's sake, Billy, listen to me.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.600
I need you to check the car for me, okay?

30:30.680 --> 30:33.120
Have a look under the steering
wheel or under the footwell,

30:33.200 --> 30:35.600
anything that you can see
that might be unusual.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.960
- All right. Yeah, um...

30:41.040 --> 30:44.040
(suspenseful music)

30:56.600 --> 30:59.600
Lana, there's some masking
tape underneath the foot mat.

31:00.760 --> 31:01.560
- All right, okay.

31:01.640 --> 31:05.560
Can you really carefully
lift up the masking tape?

31:08.880 --> 31:10.000
- [Billy] There's...

31:10.080 --> 31:12.080
There's a wire, Lana.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.960
- Can you see where it's leading to?

31:17.800 --> 31:19.800
- Um...

31:24.040 --> 31:27.720
(stammering) The glove box.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.520
Fucking hell.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.880
Shit, shit, shit.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.400
It's hooked up to summat.
Looks like a bomb.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.240
I've gotta get out the car.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.280
- No, Billy!
- If it explodes I'm done for.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.560
- Do not get out of the car!
- I'm gonna die.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.760
- Do not get out of the car!

31:43.840 --> 31:47.280
You just need to stay calm
and listen to me, all right?

31:47.360 --> 31:50.280
(ominous music)

31:50.360 --> 31:52.280
- We need to get the vehicle
away from the crowds.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.880
Get Lana to direct Billy
to a safer location,

31:54.960 --> 31:56.560
away from the tube.

31:56.640 --> 31:57.400
- Okay, texting her now.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.800
- This is DI Desai. We need an EXPO unit.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.440
Standby for exact location.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.720
- Trojan unit from Central
Eight Five, hold back.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.600
Do not engage. Repeat, do not engage.

32:07.680 --> 32:08.840
- [Lana] Right, Billy, here's the plan.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.440
You need to drive away from the tube.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.240
The police are looking
for a safe location.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.320
- How about Hackney Marshes?
- Too far.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.840
- [Bregman] Too busy at this time of day.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.840
- [Sam] He's about two
miles from Cranstead Fields.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.040
That could work.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
- Yeah, okay.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.200
- Okay, I'll send him there.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.440
(traffic honking)

32:29.280 --> 32:31.320
- [Lana] Right, we're gonna
go to Cranstead Fields, Billy.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.520
You know it, yeah?
- Yeah, I know.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.760
- [Lana] I'll meet you
there. It's gonna be okay.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.400
- The vehicle's being driven to Cranstead.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.600
We need EMT and EXPO units to meet him.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.280
- Trojan unit from Central Eight Five.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.200
New RVP for suspect is Cranstead Fields.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.480
Do not engage suspect unless
there is a significant threat.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.920
- [Robins] Trojan One, received.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.640
- When you get there, keep
the engine running, all right?

32:55.720 --> 32:56.560
Don't press anything,

32:56.640 --> 32:57.600
don't open the door, don't touch anything.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.760
Just stay still. I'm gonna
be there as soon as possible.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.360
(engine revs)

33:04.760 --> 33:06.200
- You've gotta tell Mum
and Dad I'm sorry, yeah?

33:06.280 --> 33:08.760
- Billy, tell 'em yourself.
You're gonna be fine.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.720
I'm about five minutes away.
Just stay calm, stay focused.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.800
I'm nearly there, all right?

33:16.960 --> 33:20.040
(tone chirping)

33:20.120 --> 33:22.600
(ominous music)

33:22.680 --> 33:24.040
(bomb clicks)
- Shit!

33:24.120 --> 33:26.120
- [Lana] What's happened?

33:26.520 --> 33:28.560
- There--there's a timer, Lana.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
There's a fucking timer.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.280
Shit!

33:39.360 --> 33:40.440
Shit! Fuck!
- Listen, Billy.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.080
I'm gonna help you, I swear down,

33:42.160 --> 33:43.720
but you need to focus, okay?

33:43.800 --> 33:46.560
You just need to concentrate
on getting to the park.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.440
You're only a few minutes away.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.920
When you get there drive
straight onto the field

33:50.000 --> 33:52.600
and it'll be fine, I promise.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.160
You're gonna be safe.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.480
(alert rings)

33:55.560 --> 33:57.640
- [Billy] Oh, fucking hell.
My battery's gonna die.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.760
- Billy?
(line beeps)

33:59.840 --> 34:00.600
Billy!

34:00.680 --> 34:03.600
- This is Central Seven Four.
I need eyes on the ground.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.920
Do we have units yet at Cranstead?

34:08.920 --> 34:11.320
- [Pilot] Aerial Nine Eight,
we have visual on target,

34:11.400 --> 34:13.640

34:28.200 --> 34:30.080

34:30.160 --> 34:32.800

34:39.720 --> 34:43.080
(police sirens wailing)

34:49.960 --> 34:52.440
- [Dispatcher] EXPO is incoming.
Just secure the perimeter.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.240
Evacuate all members of
the public from the area.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.440
- [Robins] Costa, secure
yourself a firing position.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.520
- [Costa] Roger.

35:01.440 --> 35:02.200
- Move!

35:02.280 --> 35:04.360
Move! Clear the area now!

35:07.680 --> 35:11.520
- [Pilot] Suspect is
approaching the location.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.040
- [Billy] Move! Move!

35:15.120 --> 35:17.000
Get out the way! Move!
(horn honking)

35:17.080 --> 35:18.840
- [Footballer] Run!

35:18.920 --> 35:21.920
(suspenseful music)

35:25.120 --> 35:27.800
- [Hass] Get away from that car!

35:27.880 --> 35:29.080
- Oi, go! Get the fuck out of here!

35:29.160 --> 35:30.880
- You could have killed us!
(footballers shouting)

35:30.960 --> 35:31.880
- [Footballer] It's the bomb squad! Run!

35:31.960 --> 35:34.800
- There's a bomb in the car!
There's a bomb in the car!

35:34.880 --> 35:35.680
- Billy. Billy.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.760
Billy, look. It's me, it's Hass.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.760
Stay still, okay?

35:40.840 --> 35:41.760
Now, we're gonna work...

35:41.840 --> 35:43.320
We gonna work around you, okay?

35:43.400 --> 35:45.080
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, look at me!

35:45.160 --> 35:47.000
It's gonna be okay. Stay still.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.560
- No, no, no, no, Hass.
I'm losing it, Hass.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.640
- Billy! Billy, Billy.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.080
Stay calm. Just stay calm.

35:54.160 --> 35:56.160
It's gonna be okay.

36:00.560 --> 36:03.560
- (sighs) Lana.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.640
- Oh my god.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
(sirens wailing)

36:09.080 --> 36:10.240
- I'm worried he's gonna bolt.
- Get everyone back.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.320
I'll speak to him.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.240
- I'll get hers.
- Thanks.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.120
- Billy! I'm here.
- Lana.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.560
- All right, it's gonna be fine.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.640
Just stay really still for me,

36:19.720 --> 36:20.760
yeah, and I'm gonna have
look around the car.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.360
- Yeah, you've gotta do summat. It's...

36:22.440 --> 36:24.440
It's about three minutes, yeah?

36:24.960 --> 36:25.720
I gotta get out.
- Just stay still.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.000
I'll go and have a look.
Don't touch anything.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.400
I'm just gonna check the car, okay?

36:28.480 --> 36:29.920
- Yeah, yeah.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.600
Just--just hurry!

36:31.680 --> 36:34.680
(suspenseful music)

36:40.480 --> 36:43.560
(helicopter buzzing)

37:10.800 --> 37:13.000
How bad is it?

37:13.080 --> 37:14.000
- It's fine.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.280
- I can tell when you're
lying, man. So how bad is it?

37:18.760 --> 37:21.120
(Billy sighs)

37:21.200 --> 37:22.240
- It's fine.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.600
- Lana!

37:23.680 --> 37:25.040
- It's fine, Billy.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.120
- Lana!

37:27.840 --> 37:29.840
- What's he done?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
What's he done?

37:36.120 --> 37:37.640
- [Billy] Lana!

37:37.720 --> 37:38.640
Lana!

37:38.720 --> 37:41.440
(sirens wailing)

37:47.600 --> 37:50.440
- Trojan Five Four, I have visual.

37:51.720 --> 37:55.200
(Billy breathing heavily)

37:58.000 --> 38:00.360
- EXPO is at the device. Cordon secure.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.000
Sniper's in position.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.080
- Good work.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.600
- [Billy] Lana!

38:06.680 --> 38:07.840
- The timer, it makes no sense.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.200
- Why?
- How would the bomber know

38:09.280 --> 38:10.360
where he's gonna be when
the device goes off?

38:10.440 --> 38:11.880
I don't get it.

38:11.960 --> 38:12.880
- It's a decoy?

38:12.960 --> 38:14.080
- Yeah.
- Lana, I need to get out!

38:14.160 --> 38:15.680
It's less than two minutes, yeah?

38:15.760 --> 38:16.720
Lana, get me out the car!

38:16.800 --> 38:18.320
- Billy! Listen to me!

38:18.400 --> 38:20.600
Listen to me! Look at me, yeah?

38:20.680 --> 38:21.920
The timer, it means nothing.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.160
They put it there as a trick
so that you open the door!

38:24.240 --> 38:25.520
- Please.
- Can you hear me?

38:25.600 --> 38:26.320
- Please.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.160
- So don't touch it! Stay still!

38:27.240 --> 38:29.200
- Oh, fuck.
- It's gonna be fine.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.280
Listen to me. I'm your sister, okay?

38:33.240 --> 38:35.600
You need to trust me. I'm
gonna go and get some stuff.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.440
- Lana, please don't go.

38:36.520 --> 38:38.520
- You gotta trust me.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.480
It's gonna be fine.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.560
- Please. Please.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.800
Okay. Okay.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.800
All right. Okay.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.720
(tense music)

39:00.040 --> 39:00.960
- What's happening?

39:01.040 --> 39:03.760
- Billy's freaked out by the
timer but I'm sure it's a trap.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.680
I need to get him out but I'm worried

39:04.760 --> 39:06.440
that the driver's side might be rigged.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.480
- Well, what about the passenger side?

39:07.560 --> 39:09.360
- No, that's where the device
is. I don't wanna risk it.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.960
They could have done all
the doors. I don't know.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.720
- Come on.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
Lana, I need you!

39:16.440 --> 39:18.560
(high-pitched tone hums)

39:18.640 --> 39:21.240
(timer chirps)

39:22.960 --> 39:24.320
Lana!

39:24.400 --> 39:26.960
(ominous music)

39:27.040 --> 39:29.320
(timer beeping)
Lana!

39:29.400 --> 39:31.400
Lana, do something!

39:31.920 --> 39:33.680
Fuck! No, no!

39:33.760 --> 39:34.720
Hey, Lana!

39:34.800 --> 39:36.680
- Okay, let's extract
him out the rear window.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.760
- [Pete] Rear window. Right.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.920
- Lana! Lana!
(timer beeping)

39:43.000 --> 39:45.760
- [Costa] Trojan Five Four,
suspect is unlocking door.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.760
Repeat, suspect is-

39:46.840 --> 39:48.840
- Lana!
- Billy!

39:49.320 --> 39:51.400
Billy, look at me! Billy!

39:53.080 --> 39:54.480
(Lana screams)

39:54.560 --> 39:56.160
No! No!

39:56.240 --> 39:58.240
No!

39:59.640 --> 40:02.160
(blast roars)

40:12.080 --> 40:15.080
(car alarm honking)

40:24.440 --> 40:27.200
(sirens wailing)

40:54.440 --> 40:57.000
(sombre music)

41:29.000 --> 41:31.280
(Val sobs)

43:19.200 --> 43:22.160
- [Thom] Hi, it's me. Uh,
I've been round yours.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.720
No one's heard from you. Please, call me.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.800
I just need to know you're okay.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.480
(brooding music)

43:53.360 --> 43:55.720
It's me again. I, um...

43:55.800 --> 43:58.400
I can't imagine what you're
going through. I just...

44:00.040 --> 44:02.240
Christ.

44:02.320 --> 44:06.200
I'm here if you wanna
talk, or I can come round.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.640
Whatever you need, okay? I...

44:09.720 --> 44:12.080
I don't want you to be alone.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.160
Just call me.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.960
(siren wailing)

44:58.200 --> 45:00.960
(sinister music)

45:45.880 --> 45:48.560
(ominous music)
