00:00.123 --> 00:02.031
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.085 --> 00:05.543
Using the astrolabe
unleashes a formidable evil.

00:05.593 --> 00:08.795
How could take such a risk
with so formidable an artifact?

00:08.830 --> 00:10.565
Warehouse was gone!
You were gone!

00:10.599 --> 00:12.383
- Did I do wrong?
- No.

00:12.434 --> 00:13.601
I would've done the same.

00:13.635 --> 00:15.303
I will not give you back
the astrolabe.

00:15.337 --> 00:18.005
I don't want it back.
I want you to use it again.

00:18.023 --> 00:21.008
Take this and disappear.

00:21.026 --> 00:22.802
I'll leave Leena my research
on the dagger.

00:22.841 --> 00:24.979
Brother Adrian, have you ever
been in South Dakota?

00:25.013 --> 00:26.397
No, I have not.

00:26.448 --> 00:29.150
The Brother Adrian
that Arthur has been battling

00:29.184 --> 00:30.284
never really existed.

00:30.319 --> 00:32.186
Whatever the effects
of the astrolabe,

00:32.204 --> 00:33.738
I'm afraid it's caused Arthur

00:33.759 --> 00:35.239
to have some sort of psychotic break.

00:35.290 --> 00:36.857
Pete, was is it?

00:36.875 --> 00:38.993
A vibe.
Mykes, call the Warehouse.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.752
Leena! Artie!
Are you here?

00:47.803 --> 00:51.589
Come on, Artie.
I got a really bad...

00:51.640 --> 00:52.890
You got another one?

00:52.925 --> 00:55.593
Worse than before.
Way worse.

00:55.644 --> 00:58.045
Okay, I'm gonna call
Leena's cell again, okay?

00:58.063 --> 00:59.714
Yeah, call her, 'cause...
I don't know.

00:59.748 --> 01:01.399
Maybe...
maybe she had to go out.

01:01.433 --> 01:02.716
- huh.

01:11.159 --> 01:12.526
That's never a good sign.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.696
Okay.
But don't panic, all right?

01:15.730 --> 01:17.198
They have to be here somewhere.

01:17.232 --> 01:19.592
Yeah, well since "here" is
about the size of Rhode Island,

01:19.593 --> 01:21.369
I'd say it's a pretty good
reason to panic.

01:21.403 --> 01:24.505
Pete...

01:24.539 --> 01:26.073
I think I found them.

01:26.091 --> 01:29.176
I'll take the Dark Vault.

01:33.098 --> 01:35.416
Yo, Artie, is everything o...

01:41.423 --> 01:43.641
Artie.

01:47.613 --> 01:49.864
Artie!

01:49.898 --> 01:51.282
Leena?

01:51.316 --> 01:54.652
Aw, come on.

01:54.703 --> 01:57.288
Mykes, there's nothing here
but a mess.

01:57.322 --> 02:00.708
This place has been tossed.

02:00.742 --> 02:02.660
Myka, can you hear me?
Myka?

02:02.711 --> 02:06.714
Pete, I, um... just get
to the Bronze Sector now.

02:06.748 --> 02:08.666
What is it?
Are you okay?

02:08.717 --> 02:12.470
No, I'm not.

02:12.504 --> 02:13.888
We're not.

02:19.061 --> 02:21.595
Myka.
Myka, are you...

02:25.317 --> 02:27.318
My God, what...

02:27.352 --> 02:30.021
She's dead.

02:30.072 --> 02:31.472
What happened?

02:31.490 --> 02:35.326
Someone shot her.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.329
Someone...

02:38.363 --> 02:40.414
Someone killed her.

02:40.449 --> 02:44.502
Arthur.
I'm afraid Arthur took her life.

02:44.536 --> 02:46.671
No way!
Okay?

02:46.705 --> 02:48.372
Artie would never...

02:48.423 --> 02:50.503
No one is more disturbed
than I am, Agent Lattimer.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.843
I realize it sounds unlikely.

02:52.878 --> 02:55.379
Unlikely?
Try impossible.

02:55.430 --> 02:58.299
Pete, I've been telling you
what's happening.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.384
And in light of recent
circumstances...

03:00.435 --> 03:02.053
There's no other explanation,
is there?

03:02.104 --> 03:05.773
I'm afraid not.

03:05.807 --> 03:09.413
I made her a promise and now...

03:11.366 --> 03:13.234
Sorry, all.

03:13.252 --> 03:14.732
It was such a nightmare getting back.

03:14.783 --> 03:16.783
They routed me through Boston
because of weather.

03:16.784 --> 03:18.506
Tell me that makes sense.

03:20.759 --> 03:22.844
What?

03:28.743 --> 03:32.985
Sync by Alex1969
www.addic7ed.com

03:35.505 --> 03:37.903
That's not true.
That cannot be true.

03:37.937 --> 03:39.405
I'm afraid so, Claudia.

03:39.439 --> 03:43.442
It would appear the prophesy of
the astrolabe has come to pass.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.544
And an evil has been created.

03:45.579 --> 03:49.632
And that evil is Artie.

03:49.935 --> 03:51.986
When Robespierre used the astrolabe

03:52.020 --> 03:54.555
to turn French public opinion
against the king,

03:54.573 --> 03:57.558
something...
something in him changed.

03:57.576 --> 04:00.161
It turned him against
what he believed in.

04:00.195 --> 04:02.530
Which led to the Reign Of Terror.

04:02.564 --> 04:04.899
Tens of thousands died.

04:04.917 --> 04:07.502
So when Artie used it,
it turned him evil

04:07.536 --> 04:10.788
and that's why he...

04:11.174 --> 04:12.458
killed Leena.

04:12.511 --> 04:15.793
He did not kill Leena!

04:15.844 --> 04:18.579
Artie is not evil.

04:18.596 --> 04:19.805
He's been whammied,

04:19.853 --> 04:22.266
just like we've all been
whammied at some point, right?

04:22.301 --> 04:24.135
He never gave up on us,
Mrs. Frederic.

04:24.186 --> 04:26.304
No matter what happened,
no matter what we did.

04:26.355 --> 04:27.795
And I'm not about to give up on him.

04:27.796 --> 04:31.058
Claude, no one is giving up on him.

04:31.092 --> 04:32.732
We're looking for a way
to heal him now.

04:32.733 --> 04:34.836
That's why the three of you
must find him

04:34.837 --> 04:36.397
before there are
any other casualties.

04:36.431 --> 04:41.619
Okay, uh, the Dark Vault,
it was trashed.

04:41.653 --> 04:42.954
So obviously,

04:42.988 --> 04:44.789
Artie was looking
for the astrolabe, right?

04:44.823 --> 04:46.273
He doesn't have it.

04:46.291 --> 04:49.610
I entrusted HG Wells
with the astrolabe.

04:49.628 --> 04:51.445
Even I do not know where she is.

04:51.463 --> 04:53.831
And so there's no way he can
get his hands on it.

04:53.882 --> 04:56.050
Nevertheless, you must be
extremely careful.

04:56.084 --> 04:58.553
Arthur is a formidable enemy.

04:58.587 --> 05:00.972
An enemy who knows
everything about us...

05:01.006 --> 05:04.058
what we do and how we do it.

05:04.092 --> 05:07.628
And more worrisome, he knows us.

05:07.646 --> 05:10.348
Our strengths and our weaknesses.

05:10.399 --> 05:14.485
Don't worry, Mrs. Frederic.
We'll find him.

05:14.520 --> 05:19.073
Pete.

05:19.107 --> 05:20.858
My God.

05:20.909 --> 05:22.159
My God!

05:22.194 --> 05:25.580
My God!
My God!

05:25.614 --> 05:27.331
Where'd she go?

05:27.366 --> 05:28.950
Where'd she go?
Did you guys see her?

05:28.984 --> 05:31.252
- Pete...
- She was right here.

05:31.286 --> 05:34.956
She... it was Leena!

05:34.990 --> 05:37.091
You didn't you see her?

05:37.125 --> 05:39.594
- Pete.
- Come on, man.

05:39.628 --> 05:41.636
We all know this place
does crazy things.

05:45.767 --> 05:49.837
She wasn't here, was she?

05:52.774 --> 05:54.775
It's because she's dead, right?

05:54.810 --> 05:59.346
Because Leena... so she couldn't
have been here.

06:04.403 --> 06:06.621
Pete.

06:16.698 --> 06:18.799
Could she?

06:23.540 --> 06:25.374
Not very much is known
about the provenance

06:25.408 --> 06:27.012
of Magellan's astrolabe.

06:27.067 --> 06:30.453
I myself know only a small piece
of its history.

06:30.487 --> 06:33.205
But if there are answers to be had,

06:33.240 --> 06:34.373
we will find them in here.

06:34.408 --> 06:36.659
Let us hope so.

06:36.693 --> 06:38.861
It is an impressive collection.

06:38.879 --> 06:42.064
We have a great respect
for knowledge and its power...

06:42.099 --> 06:44.867
And the revelation of new ideas,
no matter what the source.

06:44.901 --> 06:47.420
- Really?
- Yes.

06:47.471 --> 06:49.255
We are under the protection
of the Vatican,

06:49.306 --> 06:51.540
not under its rule.

06:51.558 --> 06:54.310
This is Robespierre's diary.

06:54.344 --> 06:57.897
This section here is all he knew
of the astrolabe.

06:57.931 --> 07:00.816
That is not a lot.

07:05.572 --> 07:07.690
It's a beginning, Agent Jinks.

07:07.724 --> 07:10.726
We must begin somewhere.

07:10.744 --> 07:13.112
So, we know that Artie
is looking for the astrolabe

07:13.163 --> 07:15.448
and he knows that it's not here.

07:15.499 --> 07:17.232
Can we assume he doesn't know
who has it?

07:17.250 --> 07:18.400
Probably.

07:18.418 --> 07:21.504
I mean, that's what
Mrs. Frederic...

07:21.538 --> 07:22.922
Artie?

07:22.956 --> 07:24.757
Artie!
My God.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.092
No, no.
Don't. Don't. Don't.

07:26.126 --> 07:29.261
I'm sorry,
there's something wrong with me.

07:29.296 --> 07:31.013
I don't feel like myself.

07:31.048 --> 07:33.716
Yeah, you're really,
really not yourself.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.470
Artie, do you even remember
what happened?

07:35.471 --> 07:37.470
No, I can't.

07:37.521 --> 07:40.022
- It's insane.
- It's the astrolabe.

07:40.057 --> 07:42.558
Because I used it,
it's affecting me somehow.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.893
Yes.

07:43.927 --> 07:45.978
That's what we think too.

07:46.029 --> 07:47.813
And I'm told that the only way

07:47.864 --> 07:50.099
to reverse the astrolabe's effect

07:50.117 --> 07:51.700
is for me to use it again.

07:51.735 --> 07:53.455
Mrs. Frederic and Steve
are looking for...

07:53.456 --> 07:56.072
No!
There is no other way.

07:56.106 --> 07:59.775
I need the astrolabe.

07:59.793 --> 08:03.496
We're sorry, Artie,
but that's not gonna happen.

08:03.547 --> 08:04.880
Artie, listen.

08:04.915 --> 08:06.382
You told us yourself

08:06.416 --> 08:09.418
that using the astrolabe again
would destroy the Warehouse.

08:09.452 --> 08:12.721
HG, Steve, Mrs. Frederic...
they'd all be dead.

08:12.756 --> 08:14.173
I'm sure we can find something.

08:14.224 --> 08:15.674
And I am sure that the astrolabe

08:15.725 --> 08:18.511
is the only thing that can help me.

08:20.897 --> 08:22.765
Man, what the hell is that now?

08:22.799 --> 08:26.769
- It's the IRS Quartum.
- My God.

08:26.803 --> 08:28.354
What's the IRS Quartum?

08:28.405 --> 08:30.189
The quartum is under control.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.308
Just for once,
would you please listen to me

08:33.326 --> 08:34.909
and do as you are told?

08:34.945 --> 08:36.578
Artie, please.

08:36.613 --> 08:38.697
Just let us...

08:38.748 --> 08:41.984
You're not real.

08:42.001 --> 08:44.120
I'm quite real, I assure you.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.705
I'm just not here.

08:46.756 --> 08:49.425
I have the HG hologram device.

08:49.459 --> 08:53.512
But what I do not have
is the astrolabe!

08:53.547 --> 08:56.015
Now, where is it?

08:56.049 --> 08:59.001
We can't let you have it, Artie.

08:59.019 --> 09:02.004
Well, you can tell me where it
is or I could find it myself.

09:02.022 --> 09:07.776
Telling me where it is
is the safer choice.

09:07.811 --> 09:12.565
Think what happened to Leena.

09:12.616 --> 09:15.184
Artie, we can help you.
I know that we can fi...

09:15.202 --> 09:18.487
"Artie, we can help you."

09:18.521 --> 09:22.858
You still don't understand.
I am not Artie.

09:22.876 --> 09:27.196
Artie sacrificed his life
for this place.

09:27.214 --> 09:31.250
He was a slave to this warehouse
for 35 years,

09:31.301 --> 09:32.968
but no more!

09:33.003 --> 09:34.887
I will use the astrolabe

09:34.921 --> 09:39.208
to set Artie free of this warehouse

09:39.226 --> 09:43.846
and from all of you,
no matter what the cost.

09:47.067 --> 09:50.152
Guys, look, it's one of those
eye pole thingies.

09:50.187 --> 09:52.307
It's not the HG hologram
device, it's one of Hugo's.

09:52.308 --> 09:54.723
He's somewhere in the Warehouse.

10:14.794 --> 10:16.011
Claudia.
Claudia, get back!

10:16.046 --> 10:17.346
Artie could still be in there!

10:17.380 --> 10:19.598
I know, I know.
Just wait.

10:19.633 --> 10:21.600
Fire extinguishers.
I'll seal off the quartum.

10:21.635 --> 10:22.768
All right, hurry, Claude,

10:22.802 --> 10:26.105
before it jumps to another section.

10:26.139 --> 10:28.023
Pete, here.

10:42.906 --> 10:44.623
Well, it looks like we lost Artie.

10:44.658 --> 10:46.542
We also lost half the IRS Quartum.

10:46.576 --> 10:49.111
That can't be all bad, right?
I mean, who likes the IRS?

10:49.129 --> 10:52.214
No, IRS stands for
"Imperium Romanum Sacrum."

10:52.249 --> 10:53.632
Holy Roman Empire.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.667
This is where we stored
all the Warehouse 8 files

10:55.668 --> 10:56.748
from the Holy Roman Empire.

10:56.749 --> 10:58.620
Well, if anyone
from Warehouse 8 shows up,

10:58.638 --> 10:59.842
they're gonna be pissed.

10:59.881 --> 11:01.525
Artie's hologram signal
came from here

11:01.526 --> 11:04.126
but he had plenty of time to get
away before we could reach him.

11:04.144 --> 11:06.461
- Why set the fire?
- To cover his tracks.

11:06.479 --> 11:08.519
Well, this has something to do
with the astrolabe.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.862
There's something in these crates

11:09.863 --> 11:11.183
that Artie didn't want us to see.

11:11.234 --> 11:13.302
So we dig in, and figure out
what he was after.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.972
Yeah. As soon as we un-burn
all this stuff.

11:23.079 --> 11:24.871
Nothing.

11:24.872 --> 11:27.112
We have been at this for
hours and we haven't found

11:27.113 --> 11:28.033
anything to help Artie.

11:28.084 --> 11:30.004
There's gotta be something else
that we can do.

11:30.005 --> 11:32.004
Slow and steady, Agent Jinks.

11:32.038 --> 11:34.340
Slow and steady wins the race.

11:34.374 --> 11:35.874
This may be something.

11:35.925 --> 11:37.376
It's an ancient Italian dialect,

11:37.427 --> 11:39.845
so if I might take the liberty
of paraphrasing.

11:39.879 --> 11:41.430
Please, I insist.

11:41.464 --> 11:43.849
"If any man shall live
the same day twice,

11:43.883 --> 11:46.852
"his reason shall fracture

11:46.886 --> 11:52.224
and he shall live his life
as two until there is only one."

11:53.476 --> 11:56.528
"He shall live as two."

11:56.563 --> 11:57.846
A dual personality.

11:57.864 --> 12:00.816
That would be my interpretation.

12:00.850 --> 12:05.854
As darkness overcomes the light,
so shall evil overcome goodness.

12:05.872 --> 12:07.623
That's like Robespierre.

12:07.657 --> 12:09.697
He started out believing
that the people of France

12:09.698 --> 12:10.618
could govern themselves

12:10.619 --> 12:12.859
but ended up using the
guillotine to keep them in line.

12:12.860 --> 12:14.797
A scythe above all heads.

12:14.831 --> 12:16.698
If I'm interpreting this correctly,

12:16.716 --> 12:20.469
the evil that is created
comes from within.

12:20.503 --> 12:23.389
There it is, then.

12:23.423 --> 12:26.675
The explanation for what he's done.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.594
Fractures can be healed.

12:28.645 --> 12:30.045
There has to be some way

12:30.063 --> 12:33.215
to reach the real Artie's good side.

12:33.233 --> 12:34.549
Perhaps.

12:34.567 --> 12:36.852
But according to this,
the darkness will eventually

12:36.886 --> 12:39.405
extinguish the light forever.

12:39.439 --> 12:45.077
If this happens, the Arthur
that we know is lost.

12:45.111 --> 12:47.396
Well, considering
what he's already done,

12:47.414 --> 12:49.782
you should leave as soon as possible.

12:49.833 --> 12:52.534
I'll start arranging it.

12:52.568 --> 12:56.071
Thank you, Brother Adrian.
We're in your debt.

12:56.089 --> 12:58.507
Yes, you are.

12:58.541 --> 13:03.128
And if all this works out, I'd
like to have my astrolabe back.

13:10.176 --> 13:13.678
The Holy Roman Empire hosted
Warehouse 8 in Germany,

13:13.697 --> 13:16.648
from 1260 to 1517.

13:16.715 --> 13:20.685
So what would Artie want
in Warehouse 8?

13:20.703 --> 13:22.823
And then what does it have
to do with the astrolabe?

13:22.857 --> 13:25.177
I mean, according to this,
Magellan's astrolabe was never

13:25.178 --> 13:25.858
in the Warehouse.

13:25.859 --> 13:28.393
- How did he even get it?
- None of this makes any sense.

13:28.411 --> 13:31.096
That's what's bothering me.
Artie always makes sense.

13:31.130 --> 13:32.664
So, what are we missing?

13:32.698 --> 13:35.138
Well, it looks like some of
the inventory didn't get entered

13:35.139 --> 13:35.859
into the computer,

13:35.860 --> 13:37.617
so we should just check the manifest.

13:43.593 --> 13:46.344
Pete.

13:47.597 --> 13:49.464
No.

13:49.515 --> 13:51.049
No.
No, no, no.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.384
No, no.

13:52.418 --> 13:57.272
You're not real,
you're an aura or something.

13:58.116 --> 13:59.990
Aren't you?

14:04.814 --> 14:07.232
This is not gonna end well.

14:15.408 --> 14:17.793
Hello?

14:17.827 --> 14:20.879
Leena?

14:20.913 --> 14:22.164
Leena?

14:26.803 --> 14:28.720
Wow.

14:28.754 --> 14:32.057
This all a bit dark and tortury.

14:32.091 --> 14:33.925
Okay.
Show's over.

14:33.959 --> 14:37.295
What are we... doing here?

14:37.313 --> 14:39.564
Hey.

14:39.599 --> 14:41.633
There.

14:47.940 --> 14:49.241
What is... so what...

14:49.275 --> 14:51.993
Is this Attila The Hun's
China cabinet?

14:59.818 --> 15:01.119
Right.

15:01.153 --> 15:05.790
Nothing here and...

15:05.824 --> 15:08.510
nothing in here.

15:08.544 --> 15:11.379
Because you're not here.

15:11.430 --> 15:15.667
I'm definitely gonna be one
of those agents that goes crazy.

15:20.506 --> 15:24.109
But if I wasn't crazy...

15:24.143 --> 15:26.811
then you would have...

15:26.845 --> 15:30.866
definitely would have...

15:30.900 --> 15:33.485
brought me here for...

15:36.489 --> 15:39.291
a reason.

15:48.134 --> 15:51.136
I'm not crazy.

15:54.807 --> 15:58.977
Thanks, Leena's spirit,
for having our backs.

15:59.011 --> 16:01.813
That must be HG's research.

16:01.847 --> 16:03.548
She told Leena
what she was working on

16:03.566 --> 16:05.734
in case something untoward happened.

16:05.768 --> 16:07.769
But why was she worried?

16:07.820 --> 16:09.905
Arthur asked her to find
the dagger for him.

16:09.939 --> 16:11.273
He was obsessed with it,

16:11.324 --> 16:14.225
so obsessed, in fact,
that HG became concerned.

16:14.243 --> 16:16.060
Because the dagger
has something to do

16:16.078 --> 16:17.562
with the astrolabe?

16:17.580 --> 16:19.581
No. Because of a vision
he was having.

16:19.615 --> 16:21.116
A vision of what?

16:21.167 --> 16:22.567
A recurring vision of you, Claudia,

16:22.568 --> 16:25.453
stabbing him
with that particular dagger.

16:25.504 --> 16:29.341
He was determined to find it,
prevent it from happening.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.959
Well, I would never do that.

16:31.010 --> 16:32.330
I mean, just because he dreamt it

16:32.331 --> 16:34.331
doesn't mean it's actually
gonna happen, does it?

16:34.332 --> 16:38.916
Not necessarily.
And not not necessarily.

16:38.935 --> 16:41.186
Comforting.

16:41.220 --> 16:43.188
Artie's mind is at war with itself.

16:43.222 --> 16:46.942
His dream could have meant
anything or nothing at all.

16:46.976 --> 16:48.760
But the dagger means something.

16:48.778 --> 16:50.178
Leena showed it to me for a reason.

16:50.179 --> 16:54.699
I beg your pardon?

16:54.734 --> 16:57.602
Look, Mrs. F,
I've been seeing Leena lately.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.122
Her... I don't know, her energy,
her aura, or whatever.

17:01.157 --> 17:03.875
She showed me the dagger because
it's part of Artie's plan.

17:03.909 --> 17:05.460
I'm sure of it.
I can feel it.

17:05.493 --> 17:09.079
Artie created and saw his dark
side as Brother Adrian, right?

17:09.114 --> 17:10.582
It would seem so.

17:10.616 --> 17:13.251
What if the dream was his dark
side's way of convincing him

17:13.285 --> 17:14.919
to find the dagger?

17:14.953 --> 17:17.555
The dark side lied to good
Artie because he didn't tell him

17:17.589 --> 17:19.057
what the dagger was for.

17:19.090 --> 17:20.258
So whatever it's for...

17:20.291 --> 17:21.771
Which is not for me to stab him with.

17:21.772 --> 17:22.853
We can't let him get to it.

17:22.895 --> 17:26.146
Then I suggest you find
the dagger first.

17:26.182 --> 17:28.400
So, HG found out that the dagger

17:28.434 --> 17:30.134
belonged to the Fourth
Duke of Gandia.

17:30.152 --> 17:32.354
He was a Spanish Jesuit
in the 16th century,

17:32.405 --> 17:34.739
which was also during
the Holy Roman Empire.

17:34.774 --> 17:37.014
And Warehouse 8 and why Artie
was looking for something

17:37.015 --> 17:38.026
in the IRS Quartum.

17:38.077 --> 17:39.744
- Did HG find it?
- I don't think so.

17:39.779 --> 17:42.280
There's nothing in here about
where this dagger is now.

17:42.314 --> 17:43.954
Well, if HG couldn't find
it, how do we?

17:43.955 --> 17:46.117
We think like Artie, right?

17:46.151 --> 17:47.485
We think like Artie.

17:47.503 --> 17:50.672
The flip side of Artie
knowing us is us knowing him.

17:50.706 --> 17:52.466
And now that we know
what he's looking for,

17:52.467 --> 17:55.159
I can find a way to track him.

17:55.177 --> 17:57.178
- What are you looking for?
- Cyber footsteps.

17:57.213 --> 17:58.380
Everybody leaves 'em.

17:58.431 --> 18:00.548
You just gotta know how to track 'em.

18:02.601 --> 18:04.502
There he is.
No.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.304
No. He knew
that I would find that.

18:06.338 --> 18:08.723
So if I...

18:08.774 --> 18:12.394
But he doesn't know this little
trick because it's brand-new.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.698
I got him.

18:16.732 --> 18:18.652
He's traveling under the alias
Luther Wastrife.

18:18.653 --> 18:19.784
Luther Wastrife.

18:19.819 --> 18:21.853
That's an anagram
for Arthur Weisfelt.

18:21.871 --> 18:23.371
- You scare me.
- See?

18:23.406 --> 18:25.446
So, some part of Artie
still wants us to find him.

18:25.447 --> 18:29.294
I just wish that part of him
would tell us where he's going.

18:29.328 --> 18:30.628
- Budapest.
- What?

18:30.663 --> 18:31.963
Just intercepted an e-mail.

18:31.997 --> 18:34.382
It seems he's going to see
a man about a dagger.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.200
All right.
Look, Claude.

18:36.218 --> 18:37.498
I think that maybe you should...

18:37.499 --> 18:38.739
Don't worry.
I'm staying here.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.340
If I don't get near the dagger,
I can't stab him with it, right?

18:41.341 --> 18:42.461
Here's hoping.
Bye, Claude.

18:42.495 --> 18:44.935
I'll slow down Luther Wastrife
and figure out what Artie got

18:44.936 --> 18:46.928
out of those Warehouse 8 files.

19:00.159 --> 19:02.894
- Enjoy your stay here.
- Thank you.

19:06.332 --> 19:09.084
Welcome to Budapest.

19:11.454 --> 19:14.005
Business or pleasure,
Mr. Wastrife?

19:14.039 --> 19:16.091
Pleasure.
Looking up an old friend.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.910
Good.

19:25.351 --> 19:27.469
Just one moment please.

19:30.106 --> 19:31.556
Come with us, please.

19:31.590 --> 19:34.926
Of course.
I hope everything's all right.

19:42.735 --> 19:45.703
- So, we found it.
- You got the dagger?

19:45.738 --> 19:47.539
No, we found it, not we got it.

19:47.573 --> 19:49.733
The man that Artie was coming
to see is an ambassador

19:49.742 --> 19:52.544
who loaned his art collection
to a museum in Prague.

19:52.578 --> 19:54.579
And the dagger's in that collection?

19:54.613 --> 19:56.093
Well, we're on our way to Prague now.

19:56.127 --> 19:57.487
Is there any new news about Artie?

19:57.488 --> 19:58.783
Yeah.
Funny thing.

19:58.801 --> 20:01.719
As it turns out, Luther Wastrife
is a suspected terrorist.

20:01.754 --> 20:03.154
He's being held by airport security

20:03.155 --> 20:05.122
at Liszt International in Budapest.

20:05.141 --> 20:06.624
Man, you are good.

20:06.642 --> 20:08.802
I'm gonna get you a list of kids
from the third grade

20:08.803 --> 20:10.595
that used to beat the crap outta me.

20:10.629 --> 20:12.597
You know, before I buffed out.

20:12.631 --> 20:14.849
Is there any new news
about the dagger

20:14.900 --> 20:17.735
or about what Artie
was looking for in Warehouse 8?

20:17.770 --> 20:19.637
Yeah.
It's all tied up together.

20:19.655 --> 20:23.741
So, apparently the deadliest
artifact in Warehouse 8

20:23.776 --> 20:25.944
was something called
the Chinese orchid.

20:25.978 --> 20:27.529
Back in the 15th century,

20:27.580 --> 20:30.031
Europe tried to force China
to trade with them.

20:30.082 --> 20:31.332
Now, China resisted.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.451
The emperor sent this artifact
as a warning...

20:33.485 --> 20:35.837
this strange blue orchid
that released a disease

20:35.871 --> 20:37.672
called English sweating sickness.

20:37.706 --> 20:39.707
An artifact that makes you
sweat to death?

20:39.758 --> 20:41.993
Okay, that's just... ewww.

20:42.011 --> 20:44.262
Well, it worked.
Europe backed off.

20:44.296 --> 20:46.965
English sweating sickness
was an epidemic

20:46.999 --> 20:48.967
that killed its victims
within 24 hours.

20:49.001 --> 20:52.520
No cure was ever found
and then it disappeared.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.838
Exactly.

20:53.856 --> 20:56.056
When Warehouse 8 agents snagged
and bagged the orchid.

20:56.057 --> 20:57.692
Now apparently,
the orchid is so lethal

20:57.726 --> 21:01.679
they encased it in some kind
of impenetrable container.

21:01.697 --> 21:02.947
Okay, wait.

21:02.982 --> 21:05.533
So, Artie is looking
for a sharp pointy dagger

21:05.568 --> 21:07.535
and an impenetrable case.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.153
Is anyone thinking what I'm thinking?

21:09.187 --> 21:11.707
I think Artie is going to use
the dagger to open the container

21:11.708 --> 21:12.657
and get the orchid.

21:12.691 --> 21:15.026
He'll release an epidemic
that potentially could wipe out

21:15.044 --> 21:16.794
half of the world's population.

21:16.829 --> 21:18.829
He wants to make it so bad
that we have no choice

21:18.830 --> 21:20.215
but to hand over the astrolabe

21:20.249 --> 21:22.000
and turn things back
to the way they were.

21:22.034 --> 21:24.535
I hate to admit it,
but it's a pretty perfect plan.

21:24.553 --> 21:26.471
Thank God he's in custody.

21:26.505 --> 21:28.305
Yeah, Mrs. Frederic's
on her way to Budapest

21:28.306 --> 21:29.540
to pick him up herself.

21:29.558 --> 21:31.678
Well, I hate to be in
his shoes when she gets there.

22:06.828 --> 22:10.563
Arthur used the barometer
of the <i>USS Eldridge</i>

22:10.581 --> 22:14.167
to stop time and escape.

22:14.202 --> 22:16.119
47 seconds was all he needed.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.146
Don't worry, Mrs. F.

22:17.177 --> 22:20.346
We're on our way
to the Czech museum now.

22:20.512 --> 22:22.552
We'll snag that dagger
before Artie even finds out

22:22.553 --> 22:23.973
it's in Prague.

22:27.715 --> 22:30.183
Since I've apparently been
sent from Rome to Germany

22:30.218 --> 22:31.008
to chauffeur you,

22:31.009 --> 22:32.809
and since Mrs. F
isn't exactly a chatterbox,

22:32.810 --> 22:34.570
would you care to tell me
what we're doing?

22:34.604 --> 22:35.964
We have to find the Chinese orchid

22:35.965 --> 22:37.125
before Artie gets the dagger.

22:37.141 --> 22:39.141
If we don't, he'll release
the sweating sickness,

22:39.142 --> 22:40.622
we'll have to give him the astrolabe,

22:40.623 --> 22:41.469
he'll turn back time,

22:41.470 --> 22:42.830
the Warehouse won't exist anymore,

22:42.831 --> 22:44.471
you'll be dead,
the world will lose hope

22:44.472 --> 22:46.616
and descend into chaos and despair.

22:46.651 --> 22:47.704
You want more?

22:47.743 --> 22:49.619
I had a lot of caffeine on the plane.

22:49.654 --> 22:51.574
In the 16th century,
the Fourth Duke of Gandia,

22:51.575 --> 22:53.623
- a Spanish Jesuit...
- Stop!

22:53.658 --> 22:56.993
You had me at
"You'll be dead."

23:00.047 --> 23:01.727
- Now, where are we going?
- Warehouse 8.

23:01.734 --> 23:03.054
Well, what used to be Warehouse 8

23:03.055 --> 23:04.135
to snag the Chinese orchid.

23:04.163 --> 23:05.413
It causes a deadly plague.

23:05.447 --> 23:06.881
Okay.
So where is Warehouse...

23:06.916 --> 23:08.282
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

23:08.300 --> 23:10.260
Pete and Myka get a dagger,
and we get a plague?

23:10.294 --> 23:11.694
When do we stop being the "B" team?

23:11.695 --> 23:13.638
We are not the "B" team.

23:13.672 --> 23:16.174
Fool, we are the second "A" team.

23:16.225 --> 23:17.345
We can't go after the dagger

23:17.346 --> 23:19.506
because Artie had a dream
I'm gonna stab him with it.

23:19.540 --> 23:21.540
So that's why we're the ones
going after a plague

23:21.541 --> 23:23.181
that could wipe out all of humanity.

23:23.232 --> 23:25.984
Thank you.

23:26.018 --> 23:27.602
I feel better.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.407
This is Warehouse 8?

23:32.441 --> 23:34.993
No, this is a German
insurance company...

23:35.027 --> 23:36.995
built over where
Warehouse 8 used to be.

23:37.029 --> 23:38.747
This way.

23:41.033 --> 23:42.333
The orchid is super dangerous.

23:42.368 --> 23:44.088
So instead of keeping it
in the Warehouse,

23:44.089 --> 23:45.670
they buried it way below.

23:45.704 --> 23:47.589
Then when 8 was abandoned for 9,

23:47.623 --> 23:49.591
they thought it was
too unstable to move.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.042
So they just left it here?

23:51.093 --> 23:54.162
Buried super deep in an
impenetrable airtight container.

23:54.180 --> 23:56.514
So don't worry about contracting
an incurable disease.

23:56.549 --> 23:58.883
Just worry about the spiders.

23:58.934 --> 24:00.835
Spiders?

24:03.856 --> 24:06.174
I just... I can't stop thinking
about it.

24:06.192 --> 24:08.843
We've never lost anyone before.
Not like this.

24:08.861 --> 24:10.344
I know.

24:10.362 --> 24:15.283
Just try and keep focus on what
we're doing here and maybe...

24:15.317 --> 24:16.534
Who am I kidding?

24:16.569 --> 24:18.686
I can't stop thinking
about it either.

24:18.704 --> 24:22.707
But you know what, whatever
happens, we are still family.

24:22.741 --> 24:24.826
And we will get through this,
I know it.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.411
Yeah?
Well, I don't.

24:26.462 --> 24:29.380
Leena isn't just dead, Myka,
Artie killed her.

24:29.415 --> 24:30.619
Even if we get him back,

24:30.620 --> 24:32.300
how are we going to tell him
what he did?

24:32.334 --> 24:34.702
- Is he even gonna remember it?
- I don't know, Pete!

24:34.720 --> 24:36.160
I don't know if he's gonna remember,

24:36.161 --> 24:38.121
and I don't know how
we're gonna tell him, okay?

24:38.122 --> 24:39.891
But that is on tomorrow's list, okay?

24:39.925 --> 24:42.427
Today's list is find the dagger,
stop Artie.

24:42.478 --> 24:45.513
So let's just... let's just
get through today.

24:47.716 --> 24:50.735
That's where the ambassador's
collection is being displayed.

24:50.769 --> 24:52.437
Nice.

24:53.856 --> 24:55.616
So, you and Mrs. Frederic
must've found out

24:55.617 --> 24:57.017
something else about the astrolabe.

24:57.018 --> 24:58.159
Not really.

24:58.194 --> 24:59.861
Hardly anything's been
written about it.

24:59.895 --> 25:01.529
"Not really."
"Hardly anything."

25:01.563 --> 25:02.664
Please quantify.

25:02.698 --> 25:04.258
Brother Adrian
is still digging, okay?

25:04.259 --> 25:06.668
I'm sure he will find something else.

25:06.702 --> 25:09.754
I mean, you know, something.

25:09.788 --> 25:12.674
What aren't you telling me?

25:12.708 --> 25:14.375
Nothing.

25:14.858 --> 25:17.378
You know, for someone who can
tell when someone else is lying,

25:17.412 --> 25:18.796
you are a...

25:18.848 --> 25:20.128
Terrible liar.
Yes, I've heard.

25:20.129 --> 25:23.301
So stop it.
Just tell me.

25:23.352 --> 25:25.270
Okay.

25:25.304 --> 25:28.056
Everything we found so far says
we can't heal Artie

25:28.090 --> 25:29.607
without using the astrolabe again.

25:29.642 --> 25:33.528
And given what that would do
to the world, that means...

25:33.562 --> 25:38.233
we can't heal Artie at all.

25:38.267 --> 25:40.401
We're not gonna lose Artie.

25:40.435 --> 25:42.987
They said we couldn't bring
you back and here you are.

25:46.208 --> 25:49.244
We'll find a way to bring Artie back.

25:59.171 --> 26:02.790
This is it.
Warehouse 8.

26:02.808 --> 26:05.260
God, I don't know why
I bother doing my nails.

26:05.294 --> 26:06.811
I know.
My cuticles are a mess.

26:10.849 --> 26:12.817
It's gotta be down there
somewhere, right?

26:12.851 --> 26:14.402
Come on.

26:15.571 --> 26:18.773
We are so the "B" team.

26:21.277 --> 26:23.828
There.
See?

26:23.862 --> 26:25.530
That wasn't so bad, was it?

26:25.581 --> 26:27.982
Well, I'm kinda wishing
that we drop some bread crumbs.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.483
Relax, Hansel.

26:29.501 --> 26:31.381
I highly doubt there's
an evil witch down here

26:31.382 --> 26:32.170
who's gonna eat us.

26:32.204 --> 26:35.540
Stranger things have happened.

26:38.711 --> 26:42.213
- Figures, right?
- I say we let ourselves in.

26:42.264 --> 26:45.266
It's from the IRS Quartum.
Brass keys don't burn.

26:49.338 --> 26:54.309
Welcome... to Warehouse 8.

26:58.147 --> 27:01.115
Not to state the obvious,
but, "uh-oh."

27:01.150 --> 27:02.317
No.
No uh-ohs.

27:02.351 --> 27:04.285
It's here.
It has to be here.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.572
I don't see how.
It's just an empty cave.

27:13.028 --> 27:14.495
Hey, wait a sec.

27:14.529 --> 27:16.530
What about this?
What do you think?

27:16.548 --> 27:20.251
Is this a clue or...

27:20.302 --> 27:22.536
just bad cave art?

27:22.554 --> 27:27.208
Given the circumstances,
let's go with clue.

27:27.226 --> 27:29.427
Although I wish it looked
at least a little bit

27:29.478 --> 27:31.045
like an orchid.

27:31.063 --> 27:34.215
Yeah, me too.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.566
Ooh, Mykes look.

27:35.601 --> 27:37.361
This thing looks like
a Klingon battle axe.

27:37.386 --> 27:39.387
- Do you think they'd mind if I...
- Yes!

27:39.405 --> 27:40.688
Yes.

27:40.722 --> 27:42.762
I do think that they would
have a problem with it.

27:42.763 --> 27:44.892
We're here to find the dagger,
all right?

27:44.910 --> 27:46.227
So what do we know?

27:46.245 --> 27:49.230
We know that it's
from the 16th century.

27:49.248 --> 27:51.032
Right.
So...

27:54.903 --> 27:57.121
That's it.

28:00.793 --> 28:03.911
Pete.

28:03.929 --> 28:06.964
- How did he know?
- Doesn't matter.

28:09.885 --> 28:14.522
Hey, Artie, old bean!
Fancy meeting you here.

28:14.556 --> 28:16.557
I mean, what are the chances, right?

28:16.591 --> 28:18.893
Don't do anything foolish.

28:18.927 --> 28:20.361
Artie...

28:20.396 --> 28:22.530
Listen to me.
We can help you.

28:22.564 --> 28:26.067
You wanna help me?
Give me the astrolabe.

28:26.101 --> 28:28.703
You know we can't do that Artie.

28:28.737 --> 28:31.772
Just come back with us.
We can work this out.

28:31.790 --> 28:35.543
You're an idiot, Pete.

28:35.577 --> 28:37.712
You're a dancing monkey,

28:37.746 --> 28:43.301
just one bad decision away
from the bottle.

28:43.335 --> 28:44.952
You really think
that Artie wants to be

28:44.970 --> 28:47.288
your substitute father?

28:47.306 --> 28:51.726
Playing daddy to a weak-willed
six-year-old

28:51.760 --> 28:54.228
trapped in an aging man's body

28:54.263 --> 28:58.015
still whining about letting
his real father die

28:58.067 --> 29:03.321
in a fire when you
should have saved him?

29:03.355 --> 29:04.739
Artie, stop.

29:04.773 --> 29:08.326
And you, with your uncompromising,

29:08.360 --> 29:10.244
prudish rigidity,

29:10.279 --> 29:12.029
and your condescension,

29:12.081 --> 29:13.698
and your infuriating belief

29:13.749 --> 29:17.001
that you're always
the smartest one in the room.

29:17.035 --> 29:19.320
You're on a direct path

29:19.338 --> 29:24.425
to spending
the rest of your life alone.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.210
Don't you understand?

29:26.261 --> 29:31.933
Artie wants you out of his life...

29:31.967 --> 29:34.102
forever.

29:36.004 --> 29:39.857
Artie, don't!

29:39.892 --> 29:43.177
What's tha...

29:43.195 --> 29:46.063
It's a noose that belonged
to Isaac Parker.

29:46.115 --> 29:49.200
He was the most famous
hanging judge in the old west.

30:03.865 --> 30:06.834
Now I'm finally done with you.

30:19.661 --> 30:21.582
It's tight.

30:21.644 --> 30:24.381
We need to get to the noose.

30:24.399 --> 30:26.233
It's getting tighter.

30:40.031 --> 30:42.783
I got it.
I got it.

30:49.374 --> 30:50.958
That was amazing.

30:51.009 --> 30:53.260
Well, today was not
a good day to die.

30:53.294 --> 30:55.212
- Yeah.
- And I am not an idiot.

30:55.246 --> 30:56.249
Pete, I know.

30:56.275 --> 30:57.600
All that stuff that he was saying

30:57.651 --> 31:01.624
about my dad and about you,
is that what he really thinks?

31:01.694 --> 31:03.187
No, that's not what Artie thinks.

31:03.221 --> 31:05.606
It's what he knows what we fear
about ourselves.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.058
I mean, that's not our Artie, right?

31:08.311 --> 31:11.436
Yeah. Well, evil Artie really
likes pushing our buttons.

31:11.538 --> 31:12.980
Now he's got the dagger.

31:13.031 --> 31:14.936
Let's go get him.

31:31.195 --> 31:32.646
Wait.

31:32.697 --> 31:33.936
Watch.

31:40.872 --> 31:43.573
What are you doing?

31:53.249 --> 31:55.535
You're from the Warehouse.

31:55.586 --> 31:57.671
So you don't have the dagger?

31:57.705 --> 32:01.675
No.
Artie has it.

32:01.709 --> 32:03.326
And you don't have the orchid.

32:03.344 --> 32:05.378
Well, no.
No.

32:05.429 --> 32:08.835
But... well, we do have a clue.
Maybe.

32:10.768 --> 32:12.802
You're absolutely right,
Agent Donovan.

32:12.836 --> 32:14.187
We do have a clue.

32:14.222 --> 32:17.524
That symbol was left there
specifically to be found

32:17.558 --> 32:20.277
by Warehouse agents.

32:20.311 --> 32:22.512
So what, we're looking
for a stolen bridge?

32:22.530 --> 32:23.401
No, no, no.

32:23.437 --> 32:26.971
The precise word for bridge
in German is <i>"Brucke."</i>

32:27.026 --> 32:29.185
And stone is <i>"Stein," Stein Brucke?</i>

32:29.203 --> 32:32.489
Franz Steinbruck to be precise.

32:32.523 --> 32:33.526
Who's he?

32:33.564 --> 32:35.635
He was the Artie of Warehouse 8.

32:37.828 --> 32:40.080
Whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop.

32:40.131 --> 32:41.715
He's from Warehouse 13.

32:41.749 --> 32:42.728
How do you know?

32:42.766 --> 32:44.142
He has yogi Ray Bengali's cobra.

32:44.165 --> 32:45.010
He showed it to me.

32:45.049 --> 32:47.049
And what is the cobra
doing out of the Warehouse?

32:47.050 --> 32:48.371
So you would know me.

32:48.389 --> 32:51.975
Arthur Nielsen, and you must be
Carl and Anya Steinbruck.

32:52.009 --> 32:53.376
Yes.
Well, thank you for coming.

32:53.394 --> 32:55.345
I apologize about the circumstances,

32:55.379 --> 32:57.597
but I'm here about the orchid.

32:57.648 --> 32:58.881
You told him about the orchid?

32:58.900 --> 33:00.317
It's all right.
He already knew.

33:00.351 --> 33:03.307
I realize this is very
difficult for you

33:03.308 --> 33:04.988
and I know the generations
of Steinbrucks

33:05.022 --> 33:06.489
have guarded the orchid.

33:06.524 --> 33:08.825
Since it was buried
beneath Warehouse 8.

33:08.859 --> 33:10.499
And when the Third Reich
started to rise

33:10.500 --> 33:11.555
and there was a fear

33:11.556 --> 33:12.996
that the Nazis would find the orchid

33:13.030 --> 33:14.664
and use it for their own ends,

33:14.699 --> 33:16.333
your family moved it, yes?

33:16.367 --> 33:17.584
We kept it safe.

33:17.618 --> 33:20.453
Yes, well, once again
the orchid is in danger.

33:20.504 --> 33:22.422
There are people after me.

33:22.456 --> 33:24.407
Dangerous rogue agents

33:24.425 --> 33:26.576
and they want the orchid
for their own agenda.

33:26.594 --> 33:28.795
It's only a question of time

33:28.846 --> 33:31.047
before these people catch up to me.

33:31.081 --> 33:33.433
You must show me where the orchid is.

33:37.054 --> 33:38.638
- Come with us.
- Wait. Wait.

33:38.689 --> 33:41.024
Wait.
These are very clever people.

33:41.058 --> 33:43.276
And they will say anything
to get the orchid.

33:43.311 --> 33:45.261
But it will be a lie.

33:45.279 --> 33:47.096
Remember. A lie.

33:47.114 --> 33:51.318
So...

33:55.456 --> 33:56.773
We haven't moved the orchid

33:56.791 --> 33:58.875
since it was brought here in 1939.

33:58.909 --> 34:02.278
Very wise.

34:02.296 --> 34:05.448
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

34:05.466 --> 34:07.801
- I think Johan and I...
- Stop!

34:07.835 --> 34:09.452
Don't trust him.

34:09.469 --> 34:11.471
- Hands in the air!
- Give up your weapon.

34:11.505 --> 34:12.839
He wants to use the orchid on us.

34:12.889 --> 34:14.391
On all of us.

34:18.346 --> 34:20.647
Yeah, yeah. Blah, blah, blah.
Wiener-schnitzel!

34:20.681 --> 34:23.201
The only way you're getting to
that orchid Artie is through us

34:23.202 --> 34:24.234
and that ain't happening.

34:24.268 --> 34:26.135
You've already lost
this battle, Pete,

34:26.152 --> 34:28.655
only you're too stupid to know it.

34:28.688 --> 34:31.992
I know you're in there, Artie.
I know you can hear me.

34:32.025 --> 34:35.078
So, please,
before anyone else gets hurt,

34:35.112 --> 34:37.998
just let us help you.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.866
All you've gotta do is trust us.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.340
It is you.
You are still there.

34:50.127 --> 34:52.012
Now, Johan.

34:52.045 --> 34:53.996
Cover your ears!

35:14.702 --> 35:16.686
Claudia, you and Steve
head off the Steinbrucks

35:16.704 --> 35:18.071
before they get to the orchid.

35:18.122 --> 35:19.489
We'll go after Artie.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.976
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

35:47.017 --> 35:50.153
- We were trained for this.
- We're the good guys.

36:13.094 --> 36:17.714
Claude!

36:17.748 --> 36:19.432
Hey, you okay?

36:19.467 --> 36:22.886
Go!
I'll handle Heidi.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.939
Yeah?
<i>Sprechen sie</i> headlock?

36:41.989 --> 36:44.657
Mykes.

36:55.970 --> 36:58.972
Duck!

37:01.175 --> 37:02.425
Pete!

37:07.181 --> 37:09.933
Get the dagger out of here.
Go, Mykes, go!

37:09.967 --> 37:13.069
I got it.

37:13.103 --> 37:15.972
- I don't wanna shoot you.
- I will kill you if I must.

37:15.990 --> 37:18.775
Hey.

37:18.809 --> 37:19.943
You missed.

37:19.977 --> 37:23.163
- I know.
- But I won't.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.198
Sometimes I miss the quiet
of the ATF.

37:25.249 --> 37:26.533
Did you find the orchid?

37:26.584 --> 37:28.384
No, but it's gotta be
around here somewhere.

37:33.657 --> 37:36.158
Myka, here.

37:36.177 --> 37:37.326
What?

37:37.344 --> 37:40.496
I've been seeing this a lot lately.

37:49.673 --> 37:52.341
It's beautiful.

37:52.359 --> 37:55.361
It's hard to believe it's so deadly.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.700
Maybe we should leave it hidden.

38:00.734 --> 38:02.118
No, it's too risky.

38:02.152 --> 38:04.687
We need to take it back
to the Warehouse and lock it.

38:08.158 --> 38:11.995
Or you could just hand it to me.

38:12.029 --> 38:15.798
You know I'm capable of this.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.258
That's right.

38:25.309 --> 38:28.228
Good.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.929
Good.

38:29.980 --> 38:31.814
And I'll take that dagger too.

38:33.884 --> 38:35.318
Myka, don't.

38:35.352 --> 38:39.322
I'll do this right in front of you.

38:44.728 --> 38:47.030
Bring that to me now.

38:47.064 --> 38:48.744
Do it.

38:50.658 --> 38:51.918
No!

38:56.119 --> 38:58.537
Good job, partner.

38:58.572 --> 39:00.706
All right then.

39:00.741 --> 39:02.379
Artie, look.
It's over.

39:02.444 --> 39:06.697
The dagger is gonna be ground
to pieces, so just...

39:07.083 --> 39:09.084
let him go.

39:12.815 --> 39:16.901
You still think that you're
the smartest one in the room?

39:21.176 --> 39:23.942
This is over when I say it's over.

39:57.536 --> 39:59.296
- He's gone.
- He's going after the dagger.

39:59.347 --> 40:01.915
- And he's got the orchid.
- Artie, don't!

40:01.933 --> 40:03.917
You'll kill millions of people.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.353
It's not too late.

40:06.387 --> 40:09.022
I know you're still in there.
I know you can hear me.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.228
I know what I'm doing.

40:14.262 --> 40:18.031
Saving Artie from all of you.

40:18.066 --> 40:22.986
You, you're the worst of them.

40:23.037 --> 40:26.623
You're an insolent, annoying child

40:26.658 --> 40:29.159
who will never be a woman...

40:29.210 --> 40:34.131
Who only wants everybody to love her.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.250
Here's the truth:

40:36.284 --> 40:38.635
Artie doesn't love you.

40:38.670 --> 40:43.390
He doesn't love any of you.

40:43.424 --> 40:45.994
You've ruined his life.

40:55.403 --> 40:56.770
Artie!

40:56.804 --> 40:59.612
I cast you out!

41:08.199 --> 41:10.083
Think they can beat me.

41:10.118 --> 41:13.120
- My God.
- The arrogance.

41:13.154 --> 41:14.872
I cast you out.

41:17.458 --> 41:19.459
And now.

41:26.768 --> 41:28.602
Claudia, do it.

41:28.636 --> 41:31.021
Save me.

41:32.774 --> 41:35.508
I cast you out!

41:35.526 --> 41:37.144
Claudia, no!

41:40.982 --> 41:41.949
I'm sorry.

41:41.983 --> 41:44.284
It's okay.

41:44.319 --> 41:45.652
It's okay.
