10:01.331 --> 10:03.333
SORRY. I KNOW IT HURTS.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.236
(groaning)
NO. NO.

10:06.236 --> 10:08.839
I'M FINE. COME HERE.

10:08.839 --> 10:12.112
I'M JUST FINE.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.714
(Evan screaming)

10:13.714 --> 10:16.616
(Lexie) AND THEN I JOINED
DR. SLOAN AND DR. ROBBINS.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.190
OKAY, THIS IS ALL SET.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.192
OH! I'M SORRY. SORRY.

10:22.192 --> 10:25.095
(Callie) HEY, ARE YOU FREE?
I NEED A HAND.
UH, YEAH,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

10:25.095 --> 10:26.927
(Arizona) IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE OKAY.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.700
(Evan screaming)
WE'RE JUST GONNA EXAMINE YOU,

10:29.700 --> 10:32.933
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
WARMED UP AGAIN, OKAY, EVAN?
(groaning)

10:32.933 --> 10:35.135
MY DAD.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.238
WHERE IS MY DAD?
YOU JUST GIVE ME HIS NAME,
AND WE'LL FIND HIM, OKAY?

10:38.238 --> 10:41.071
'CAUSE HE'S GOTTA BE LOOKING
FOR YOU, TOO.

10:41.071 --> 10:45.045
(Evan whimpering and crying)

10:45.045 --> 10:47.948
HERE. FOR THE SMELL.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.420
LISTEN...

10:50.420 --> 10:54.054
BURNS LIKE THIS
ARE REALLY... DIFFICULT.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.657
YOU DON'T REALLY...
YOU WANNA SWITCH WITH SOMEONE--

10:57.657 --> 11:00.861
KAREV OR SOMEBODY?
YOU THINK I CAN'T HANDLE THIS?

11:00.861 --> 11:04.134
NO, NO, NO, I-I--
BECAUSE I-I CAN.
I'M GOOD. I'M HERE.

11:04.134 --> 11:06.136
(Richard) SO YOU STAYED
WITH THE BURN PATIENT

11:06.136 --> 11:08.068
IN THE TRAUMA ROOM?

11:08.068 --> 11:11.241
I... YEAH, I DID.
AND WHO WAS WITH MRS. BECKER?

11:11.241 --> 11:14.174
(Lexie) REED ADAMSON.
OKAY, THIS IS ALL SET.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.676
NO, I WAS NEVER
WITH MRS. BECKER.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.208
I WAS WITH HER LITTLE BOY.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.310
I HAD JUST FINISHED
WITH HIM, ACTUALLY.

11:20.310 --> 11:24.214
OH! I'M SORRY. SORRY.
HEY, ARE YOU FREE?
I NEED A HAND.

11:24.214 --> 11:27.057
UH, YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
OKAY.

11:27.057 --> 11:29.059
SO GOOD NEWS, BIG GUY.

11:29.059 --> 11:30.791
YOU ARE FINE.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.194
HIS PULSE-OX LOOKS GOOD.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.695
HE'S TOTALLY FINE.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.327
OH, THANK YOU. MWAH.

11:37.327 --> 11:40.030
UH, HEY, CAN HE STAY IN HERE
WITH ME,

11:40.030 --> 11:42.202
JUST UNTIL HIS DAD COMES?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.434
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
IT'S A FULL HOUSE ANYWAY.

11:44.434 --> 11:46.737
SO I WENT TO HELP DR. TORRES.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.739
ROY MACINAW,
56-YEAR-OLD FIREFIGHTER.

11:48.739 --> 11:50.741
FELL THREE STORIES
FROM A LADDER.

11:50.741 --> 11:52.743
LOOKS LIKE A HIP
AND FEMUR FRACTURE.

11:52.743 --> 11:56.086
MAYBE RADIUS, TOO.
HE'S WAKING UP.
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:56.086 --> 12:00.150
UH, I-I-I HAD HIM.
I-I GOT--I GOT TO THE WINDOW.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.893
ROY, ROY, YOU FELL FROM
THE LADDER. IT WAS A BAD FALL.

12:02.893 --> 12:04.855
BUT WE'RE GONNA FIX YOU UP.

12:04.855 --> 12:07.097
GIVE HIM 10 OF MORPHINE
AND GET HIM ADMITTED.

12:07.097 --> 12:09.399
WHERE'S THE KID? I HAD HIM.
HE WAS GOING AFTER A KID?

12:09.399 --> 12:11.231
(Owen) SHEPHERD.
YEAH.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.304
HE HAS UNEVEN PUPILS.
ABDOMEN'S RIGID.
HE'S GONNA NEED AN ULTRASOUND.

12:14.304 --> 12:17.267
YEAH. HE'S GONNA NEED
A HEAD C.T., TOO.

12:17.267 --> 12:19.439
PAGE ME WHEN YOU GET
HIS SCANS.
HE NEEDS EVERYTHING.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.012
LET'S TAKE HIM NOW.
LET'S GO.
READY? LET'S GO.

12:22.012 --> 12:24.444
(Richard) AND YOU LEFT
THE E.R. AT THAT POINT?
I TOOK HIM TO X-RAY, YES.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.147
DID YOU EVER HEAR MRS. BECKER
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT PAIN?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.148
NO.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.120
(Jackson) THE NURSE DID.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.783
HE SAID
SHE WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN.

12:32.783 --> 12:35.525
WHOSE PATIENT IS BED ONE--
CATHY BECKER?
(Jackson and Cristina) NOT MINE.

12:35.525 --> 12:37.527
SHE'S COMPLAINING
OF PAIN.

12:37.527 --> 12:39.529
(Richard) AT THIS POINT,
WHO WAS IN CHARGE

12:39.529 --> 12:42.162
OF MRS. BECKER'S CARE?
WHOSE PATIENT WAS SHE?

12:42.162 --> 12:45.495
I WAS NEVER ON HER.
I WAS IN THE O.R.
WITH DR. BAILEY.

12:45.495 --> 12:47.537
I'M NOT--I-I DON'T--
NOT MINE.

12:47.537 --> 12:50.200
NO IDEA.
DID YOU ORDER PAIN MEDS?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.372
NO, YANG DID.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.805
NEXT TIME I SAW HER,

12:54.805 --> 12:57.848
SHE WAS...
SHE WAS DYING.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.511
(choking)

13:01.511 --> 13:05.185
(choking continues)

13:15.165 --> 13:18.198
WHEN YOU SAW HER,
SHE WAS DYING?

13:18.198 --> 13:21.371
NO, SHE WASN'T DYING.
SHE SAID SHE HAD SOME PAIN.

13:21.371 --> 13:24.374
WHOSE PATIENT IS BED ONE--
CATHY BECKER?
(Jackson and Cristina) NOT MINE.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.536
SHE'S COMPLAINING OF PAIN.

13:28.578 --> 13:31.441
HEY, KAREV.
YOU GOT BED ONE?

13:31.441 --> 13:34.244
NO.
YOUR INITIALS
ARE ON THE CHART, MAN.

13:34.244 --> 13:37.117
(Richard) SO YOU CHECKED
WITH KAREV?

13:37.117 --> 13:40.120
I TRIED TO.
HE WAS ON THE PHONE.
(Alex) I HAD NEVER EVEN SEEN
THAT PATIENT.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.093
I-I WAS STITCHING UP
NOSEDIVE.
(Richard) NOSEDIVE?

13:43.093 --> 13:45.996
WHAT'S HIS NAME? THE--THE DUDE
THAT, UH, THAT FAINTED.

13:45.996 --> 13:47.557
DR. PERCY.
(Larry laughs) NOSEDIVE.

13:47.557 --> 13:49.900
THAT'S GONNA STICK.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.902
SO YOU WERE WITH
DR. PERCY?

13:51.902 --> 13:54.935
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.506
HEY, KAREV,
YOU HAVE BED ONE?
NO.

13:56.506 --> 13:59.209
YOUR INITIALS
ARE ON THE CHART, MAN.

13:59.209 --> 14:01.872
(Alex) IZ, I'M DONE.

14:01.872 --> 14:03.313
I'M DONE LEAVING YOU MESSAGES.

14:03.313 --> 14:06.276
I'M DONE TALKING TO YOUR MOM,
WHO'S PROBABLY LYING TO ME.

14:06.276 --> 14:08.348
HEY, ARE YOU GONNA
HELP ME WITH THIS?

14:08.348 --> 14:11.221
LISTEN,
IT'S BEEN A WEEK, IZ.

14:11.221 --> 14:13.483
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE ALIVE OR DEAD.

14:13.483 --> 14:15.485
SO IF I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU
BY TONIGHT,

14:15.485 --> 14:17.487
I AM CALLING THE POLICE

14:17.487 --> 14:21.231
AND I'M REPORTING YOU
AS A MISSING PERSON.

14:29.299 --> 14:32.472
SO WHO GAVE HER
THE MORPHINE?
(Alex) NO IDEA.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.874
I NEVER EVEN SAW HER.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.877
I ORDERED IT. I DID.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.310
YOUR INITIALS
ARE ON THE CHART, MAN.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.452
HOW LONG
DO I HAVE TO WORK HERE

14:42.452 --> 14:44.414
BEFORE THEY INSERT
A BUG UP MY ASS?

14:44.414 --> 14:46.987
YOU GUYS ARE ALL SO CRANKY.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.060
(Cristina) WELL, DR. AVERY
SEEMED UNCOMFORTABLE

14:50.060 --> 14:52.622
UH, CONSULTING ON A PATIENT
THAT WASN'T HIS.

14:52.622 --> 14:55.996
SO I CHECKED WITH THE PATIENT
AND ASKED HER ABOUT HER PAIN,

14:55.996 --> 14:58.298
AND SHE SAID IT WAS LOCALIZED
TO HER CHEST BURNS.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.371
SO I CHECKED HER CHART FOR ANY
ALLERGIES OR DRUG INTERACTIONS

15:01.371 --> 15:03.373
AND SAW THAT SHE HAD
SILVER SULFADIAZINE

15:03.373 --> 15:06.536
AND 1 GRAM OF CEFAZOLIN
AND 800 OF IBUPROFEN,

15:06.536 --> 15:08.979
SO I ORDERED 2 OF MORPHINE.

15:08.979 --> 15:12.342
YOU MEMORIZED HER CHART?
YEAH, I CHECKED IT THREE TIMES
'CAUSE SHE WASN'T MY PATIENT.

15:12.342 --> 15:15.315
SO YOU ORDERED THE MORPHINE.
DID YOU FOLLOW UP?

15:15.315 --> 15:18.548
UH, NO. MY PATIENT
HAD COME BACK FROM C.T.

15:18.548 --> 15:20.690
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, PEOPLE,
LISTEN UP.

15:20.690 --> 15:22.692
THE BURN UNIT
AND THE I.C.U. ARE FULL.

15:22.692 --> 15:25.195
ALL PATIENTS ARE STAYING HERE
UNTIL SOME BEDS OPEN UP,

15:25.195 --> 15:27.557
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S KEEP
THE TRAUMA ROOMS CLEAR

15:27.557 --> 15:29.559
FOR THE BURN CASES, PLEASE.
HEAD C.T. WAS FINE.

15:29.559 --> 15:32.562
ABDOMINAL SCANS SHOW A LIVER LAC
AND POSSIBLE KIDNEY HEMATOMA.

15:32.562 --> 15:35.565
I'M GONNA CHECK ON AN O.R.
PAGE ME WHEN HE'S STABLE.
UH-HUH.

15:35.565 --> 15:37.707
(Evan screaming and crying)

15:37.707 --> 15:39.239
THAT'S HIM.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.972
THE KID--
THE KID IN THE WINDOW.

15:41.972 --> 15:43.613
IS HE DYING?

15:43.613 --> 15:45.615
OH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S HERE FOR--

15:45.615 --> 15:48.148
HE'S FINE, ROY.
HE'S BEING TAKEN CARE OF.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.380
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.
OH, NO.

15:50.380 --> 15:51.551
NO.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.623
I KILLED HIM.

15:53.623 --> 15:57.257
(woman) CAN I ASK SOMETHING?

15:57.257 --> 16:00.260
YOU SAY THE PATIENT ASKED FOR
MEDS FOR PAINS IN HER CHEST?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.532
NO, ON HER CHEST.
SHE HAD BURNS.

16:02.532 --> 16:04.995
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU,
DR. YANG.

16:04.995 --> 16:07.337
WHAT, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT SHE HAD CHEST PAINS,

16:07.337 --> 16:09.499
THAT I ORDERED
THE WRONG MEDICATION?
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

16:09.499 --> 16:12.342
THE NEXT ENTRY ON HER CHART
WAS DR. GREY

16:12.342 --> 16:14.344
PUTTING IN A CHEST TUBE, SO--
THANK YOU, DR. YANG.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.676
MEREDITH?
NO, LEXIE.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.449
WELL, I THOUGHT LEXIE
WAS ON THE BURN--
THANK YOU, DR. YANG.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.311
(Lexie) I WAS.

16:21.311 --> 16:23.313
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
WITH THE BURN KI--

16:23.313 --> 16:25.215
WITH EVAN LANG.

16:25.215 --> 16:26.516
(Evan whimpering)

16:26.516 --> 16:28.518
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, LISTEN UP.

16:28.518 --> 16:30.490
THE BURN UNIT
AND THE I.C.U. ARE FULL.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.493
ALL PATIENTS ARE STAYING HERE
UNTIL SOME MORE BEDS OPEN UP,

16:33.493 --> 16:36.496
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S KEEP
THE TRAUMA ROOMS CLEAR

16:36.496 --> 16:38.598
FOR THE BURN CASES, PLEASE.
(equipment beeps)

16:38.598 --> 16:42.072
(whispers) I CAN'T GET
A PULSE ON THE DOPPLER.
OKAY, EVAN, I HAVE TO DO
AN ESCHAROTOMY.

16:42.072 --> 16:44.474
NOW I HAVE TO CUT INTO
THE BURNED SKIN

16:44.474 --> 16:47.607
TO RESTORE CIRCULATION
TO YOUR ARM, OKAY?
(crying)
DID YOU FIND MY DAD?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.180
(Arizona) YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL ASK AGAIN IN A SEC, OKAY?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.182
PUSH ANOTHER 25 OF FENTANYL.

16:52.182 --> 16:55.715
OKAY, EVAN, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
TALK TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

16:55.715 --> 17:00.320
SO YOU SAID YOU'RE IN TOWN
LOOKING AT A COLLEGE?
YEAH, I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP
TO CORNISH.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.692
I'M NOT SURE I CAN TAKE
THE RAIN. AAH!

17:02.692 --> 17:05.695
(screaming and crying)

17:07.397 --> 17:08.728
NO! NO!

17:08.728 --> 17:11.601
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I KNOW. YOU'RE OKAY, PAL.

17:11.601 --> 17:14.264
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
(Arizona) THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT AT FIRST, TOO--

17:14.264 --> 17:17.267
ABOUT THE RAIN. DR. GREY,
YOU GREW UP HERE, RIGHT?

17:17.267 --> 17:20.110
SO YOU GET USED
TO THE RAIN...
(crying)

17:20.110 --> 17:21.441
(whispers) LEXIE.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.143
(continues crying)

17:23.143 --> 17:26.616
DR. GREY, STEP OUT. COME BACK
WHEN YOU'VE GOT IT TOGETHER.

17:26.616 --> 17:28.448
GO.

17:33.223 --> 17:36.686
(panting)

17:36.686 --> 17:38.358
SHE CAN'T BREATHE.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.160
OH, IT'S OKAY. I'M OKAY.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.163
MY MOM.
SHE CAN'T BREATHE.

17:47.697 --> 17:50.540
(choking)

17:50.540 --> 17:52.602
IT WAS A PNEUMOTHORAX.

17:52.602 --> 17:56.446
WHAT'S THAT?
HER LUNG COLLAPSED.

17:56.446 --> 18:00.350
ONE, TWO, THREE.

18:00.350 --> 18:03.783
DANNY... DON'T LET HIM
SEE ME DIE.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.785
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
I PROMISE.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.289
ONE, TWO, THREE.
(Richard) YOU GOT
THE CHEST TUBE IN?

18:09.289 --> 18:13.323
NO, I W--I WAS GETTING THERE.
I WAS COUNTING--
(Richard) DID YOU GO IN BELOW
THE FIFTH INTERCOSTAL SPACE?

18:13.323 --> 18:16.166
YOU COULD'VE PUNCTURED
HER DIAPHRAGM.
I KNOW--I JUST--
I LOST COUNT.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.467
WHY?
(chokes)

18:17.467 --> 18:19.299
FOUR...

18:19.299 --> 18:21.131
(gasps)

18:21.131 --> 18:23.203
(gasp)

18:23.203 --> 18:25.205
(moans)

18:34.344 --> 18:36.346
(Richard) DID YOU GET
THE CHEST TUBE IN?

18:36.346 --> 18:39.489
I DID. I-I DID. I-I JUST...
SHE DID.
SHE JUST MISSED A STEP.

18:39.489 --> 18:43.823
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, F--

18:43.823 --> 18:46.896
(gasps and sighs)

18:46.896 --> 18:48.828
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

18:48.828 --> 18:51.301
I HAD TO, OKAY?
SHE WAS RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

18:51.301 --> 18:54.834
IT WAS A TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX.
YOU HAVE TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE

18:54.834 --> 18:57.907
SO THAT SHE DOESN'T CROAK BEFORE
YOU PUT THE CHEST TUBE IN.

18:57.907 --> 19:01.411
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT?
NO, I-I CAN DO IT.
I-I GOT IT.

19:01.411 --> 19:04.314
THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

19:04.314 --> 19:06.716
(Richard) AND DID SHE HAVE IT?
(Jackson) YEAH, I WATCHED.

19:06.716 --> 19:09.679
SHE--SHE WAS
A LITTLE DISTRACTED, BUT--
YOU WERE DISTRACTED?

19:09.679 --> 19:12.622
WHAT WERE YOU--
DR. YANG WAS MAKING
A TODDLER CRY.

19:12.622 --> 19:14.454
STOP!

19:14.454 --> 19:16.756
(crying)
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.558
UGH.
(crying continues)

19:18.558 --> 19:20.730
OKAY, LET ME JUST SAY
FOR THE RECORD

19:20.730 --> 19:22.632
THAT IT WAS NO TODDLER.

19:22.632 --> 19:24.864
HE WAS, LIKE, 5
IF HE WAS A DAY.
YANG--

19:24.864 --> 19:27.467
WELL, YOU WOULD'VE YELLED
AT HIM, TOO.
WHY WAS HE THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

19:27.467 --> 19:30.800
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT THERE.
THE PATIENT WAS CODING AND--
THE PATIENT WAS CODING?

19:30.800 --> 19:34.374
COAGS ARE STABLE.
GOOD, O.R. IS READY.
LET'S TAKE HIM UP.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.377
YANG, YOU'RE WITH ME.
TORRES, ADAMSON WILL CALL YOU

19:37.377 --> 19:40.380

ALMOST HAD HIM.
I WAS AT THE WINDOW.

19:54.424 --> 19:56.826

IN MY HAND.

19:56.826 --> 20:00.400

AND--AND I MISSED A STEP.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.304

YOU FELL, ROY.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.606

20:32.962 --> 20:35.565

WHO WAS WATCHING THAT KID?

20:35.565 --> 20:37.307

21:02.261 --> 21:05.264

21:07.266 --> 21:09.339

I'M S--I'M SORRY. I JUST--
I-I FEEL LIKE--
NO, YOU DON'T GET
TO FEEL ANYTHING

21:33.062 --> 21:34.564
BECAUSE HE'S FEELING
EVERYTHING.

21:34.564 --> 21:36.996
HIS EVERY NERVE IS EXPOSED
AND RAW, AND WE HAVE TO

21:36.996 --> 21:39.769
MAKE HIM FEEL WORSE
BEFORE HE'S GONNA FEEL BETTER.

21:39.769 --> 21:42.502
SO IF YOU'RE HAVING FEELINGS,
THEN YOU NEED TO SHUT THEM DOWN.

21:42.502 --> 21:46.005
YOU NEED TO SHUT THEM DOWN
AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS FUTURE

21:46.005 --> 21:48.508

29:46.085 --> 29:48.087
KEEP HER ON 100% OXYGEN.
NO, NO, DO NOT.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.059
NOT UNTIL SHE IS MORE STABLE.

29:50.059 --> 29:52.521
CRISTINA, SCRUB OUT,
GO SEE IF YOU CAN HELP. GO.

29:52.521 --> 29:55.524
THERE WAS SO MUCH SWELLING,
WE COULDN'T FIND GOOD VEINS.

29:55.524 --> 29:57.927
WE--WE HAD TO START
A CENTRAL LINE.

29:57.927 --> 30:00.429
(monitor beeping erratically)
(Charles) WE CAN'T USE
THE HYPERBARIC CHAMBER

30:00.429 --> 30:04.203
UNTIL SHE'S STABLE.
HER C.K. LEVEL'S
OVER 75,000.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.375
SHE'S GOT FULMINANT RHABDO.

30:06.375 --> 30:09.378
EVERYTHING WAS FAILING--
THE--THE KIDNEYS, LIVER, LUNGS.

30:09.378 --> 30:12.081
HER CHART WAS LIKE
A PHONE BOOK NOW.

30:12.081 --> 30:16.385
SHE'S IN S.V.T.
PUSH 6 OF ADENOSINE.
SYSTOLIC'S IN THE 70s. UM,
START HER ON DOPAMINE--5 MICS.

30:16.385 --> 30:18.988
SHE WAS CODING
WHEN I GOT THERE.
(monitor beeping erratically)

30:18.988 --> 30:20.589
WHAT THE HELL?

30:20.589 --> 30:23.522
SHE'S IN V-FIB.
OKAY, STARTING
MANUAL VENTILATION.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.155
(beeping continues)

30:26.155 --> 30:28.397
(Jackson) CHARGING TO 200.

30:28.397 --> 30:30.299
(beeping continues)

30:30.299 --> 30:33.162
(defibrillator whines)
(Alex) CLEAR.

30:33.162 --> 30:34.904
(paddles thunk)

30:34.904 --> 30:36.405
(beeping continues)

30:36.405 --> 30:39.138
UH, 300.
(defibrillator whines)

30:39.138 --> 30:41.340
CLEAR.
(paddles thunk)

30:41.340 --> 30:43.412
(beeping continues)
(Reed) NO, THERE'S BLOOD. WAIT!

30:43.412 --> 30:45.544
SHE STARTED BLEEDING OUT.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.977
SHE'S GOT BLOOD
IN HER CRIKE TUBE.

30:47.977 --> 30:51.981
SHE'S GOT BLOOD IN THE TUBE.
(beeping continues)

30:51.981 --> 30:55.284
(thunder rumbling)

30:55.284 --> 30:57.286
OH, MY GOD.

30:57.286 --> 31:01.430
(rumbling continues)

31:04.533 --> 31:06.635
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

31:08.497 --> 31:11.370
I KNOW WHY SHE DIED.

31:20.449 --> 31:22.451
(Jackson) GET AN AMP
OF BICARB IN HER!

31:22.451 --> 31:25.414
(Alex) PUSH ONE OF EPI.
(April) WHAT ABOUT CALCIUM?
DID ANYONE TRY CALCIUM?

31:25.414 --> 31:27.486
(Cristina) GET TWO MORE UNITS
OF P.R.B.C.s IN HERE!

31:27.486 --> 31:30.359
AND BRING SOME F.F.P.!
WHERE IS ALL THIS BLOOD
COMING FROM?

31:30.359 --> 31:32.661
D.I.C.--HER ORGANS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.
SHE IS BLEEDING OUT.

31:32.661 --> 31:35.064
(Derek) JUST STOP.
(doctors
yelling over each other)

31:35.064 --> 31:37.366
STOP. EVERYBODY, STOP!
IT'S OVER.

31:37.366 --> 31:39.328
YOU'VE LOST HER.

31:39.328 --> 31:41.070
SOMEBODY CALL IT.

31:41.070 --> 31:44.403
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

31:46.175 --> 31:49.208
WELL, WHOSE PATIENT IS SHE?

31:49.208 --> 31:51.210
(tone continues)

31:51.210 --> 31:54.383
WHOSE PATIENT IS THIS?

31:54.383 --> 31:58.187
(tone continues)

32:10.229 --> 32:12.201
WHAT?

32:12.201 --> 32:14.003
I'M SORRY.

32:14.003 --> 32:16.005
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

32:16.005 --> 32:18.007
DR. KEPNER.

32:24.443 --> 32:28.247
WHAT--WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

32:36.325 --> 32:40.489
(thunder rumbling)

32:40.489 --> 32:42.461
(door closes)

32:42.461 --> 32:44.633
(Richard)
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

32:44.633 --> 32:47.636
BUT DR. ADAMSON JUST SPENT
20 MINUTES IN THAT CHAIR

32:47.636 --> 32:50.599
TELLING ME WHAT
AN EXCELLENT DOCTOR YOU ARE.

32:50.599 --> 32:52.301
YOUR SCHOOL RECORDS,

32:52.301 --> 32:55.604
YOUR EVALUATION FROM MERCY WEST
ALL SAY THE SAME THING.

32:55.604 --> 32:58.747
AND I BELIEVE IT.

32:58.747 --> 33:00.449
I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOOD.

33:00.449 --> 33:02.451
DR. WEBBER,
I-I DON'T KNOW--

33:02.451 --> 33:05.384
SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL ME
WHAT WOULD'VE CAUSED

33:05.384 --> 33:07.386
CATHY BECKER TO BLEED OUT
AND DIE

33:07.386 --> 33:10.519
FROM MULTISYSTEM
ORGAN FAILURE.

33:10.519 --> 33:13.522
SHE HAD D.I.C.

33:13.522 --> 33:17.166
BURNS CAN CAUSE
MASSIVE TISSUE INJURY--
BUT THE BURN WAS PROPERLY
CLEANED AND DRESSED.

33:17.166 --> 33:19.168
WELL, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
MORE DAMAGE.

33:19.168 --> 33:21.170
I MEAN, SHE HAD
A COLLAPSED LUNG.

33:21.170 --> 33:22.531
(gasps)
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:22.531 --> 33:24.433
SHE NEEDED A CHEST TUBE.

33:27.336 --> 33:30.539
BUT WHY WOULD HER LUNGS
HAVE FAILED?

33:30.539 --> 33:33.382
SHE... SHE WENT
INTO RESPIRATORY DISTRESS.

33:33.382 --> 33:35.114
THEY SAID THEY CRIKED HER.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.017
I WASN'T THERE
FOR ANY OF THIS.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.720
AND WHY WOULD SHE NEED
A CRIKE? WHY NOT INTUBATE?

33:41.720 --> 33:46.425
WELL, HER AIRWAY WAS TOO
SWOLLEN. THEY COULDN'T GET--
BUT WHAT WOULD CAUSE THAT KIND
OF INFLAMMATION IN HER THROAT?

33:46.425 --> 33:50.359
SOOT. SMOKE INHALATION.
BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE--

33:50.359 --> 33:52.361
HOW DID
MRS. BECKER'S THROAT LOOK?

33:52.361 --> 33:55.534
(rainfall)

33:55.534 --> 33:57.536
NO, SHE W--SHE W--
SHE WASN'T HOARSE.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.239
SHE--SHE WASN'T COUGHING.
HOW DID IT LOOK, DR. KEPNER?

34:00.239 --> 34:03.312
HER BREATH SOUNDS WERE GOOD.
SHE--HER RESPIRATORY RATE WAS--

34:03.312 --> 34:05.444
WHAT--I'M ASKING YOU...

34:05.444 --> 34:09.118
WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

34:09.118 --> 34:12.121
(thunder rumbling)

34:12.121 --> 34:14.123
(rainfall)

34:14.123 --> 34:15.724
(mutters)

34:15.724 --> 34:19.057
(rainfall continues)

34:19.057 --> 34:20.389
OKAY.

34:20.389 --> 34:23.162
YOUR LUNGS SOUND GOOD,
AND YOUR VITALS ARE GREAT.

34:23.162 --> 34:27.336
OPEN UP, PLEASE.
OH, MY GOD.

34:27.336 --> 34:31.270
(sounds distorting)

34:39.708 --> 34:42.381
(sound normalizes)

34:42.381 --> 34:45.414
OKAY. UM, YOU LOOK GOOD.

34:45.414 --> 34:48.187
THESE BURNS ON YOUR CHEST
ARE PRETTY MINOR.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.489
BUT THE ONE ON YOUR CALF
MIGHT BE THIRD-DEGREE.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.422
(Richard) YOU NEVER LOOKED.

34:53.422 --> 34:56.094
YOU DIDN'T LOOK IN HER THROAT,

34:56.094 --> 34:59.428
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD,
YOU WOULD'VE SEEN SOOT.

34:59.428 --> 35:02.401
AND YOU WOULD'VE
INTUBATED IMMEDIATELY.

35:02.401 --> 35:05.434
AND NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE EVER HAPPENED.

35:05.434 --> 35:07.436
NO, THAT'S--IT'S--
I GOT DISTRACTED.
I KNOW.

35:07.436 --> 35:09.508
IT WAS--IT WAS INSANE.
I KNOW.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.381
IT WAS A SIMPLE MISTAKE.

35:12.381 --> 35:14.683
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU WERE UNDER, I KNOW--

35:14.683 --> 35:17.616
(Larry clears throat)

35:17.616 --> 35:20.749
(rainfall)

35:27.396 --> 35:29.728
I'M SORRY, DR. KEPNER.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.431
NO, I M--I MISSED ONE STEP.
I KNOW.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.163
I...

35:34.163 --> 35:36.705
AND LOOK WHAT IT'S LED TO.

35:36.705 --> 35:40.209
(monitor beeping erratically)

35:40.209 --> 35:43.572

35:47.176 --> 35:49.518
(paddles thunk)
(doctors all talking at once)

35:49.518 --> 35:52.421
(Cristina) SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.
SHE IS BLEEDING OUT.
JUST STOP. STOP.
EVERYBODY, STOP!

35:52.421 --> 35:54.853
IT'S OVER. YOU'VE LOST HER.

35:54.853 --> 35:58.227
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

35:58.227 --> 36:00.589
WELL, WHOSE PATIENT IS SHE?

36:00.589 --> 36:03.292
(tone continues)

36:03.292 --> 36:05.934
(Derek)
WHOSE PATIENT IS THIS?

36:05.934 --> 36:09.568
(tone continues)

36:09.568 --> 36:12.871
TIME OF DEATH IS 12:45 A.M.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.585
(monitor emitting

36:31.320 --> 36:33.622

37:15.734 --> 37:19.468
(wailing continues)

37:22.571 --> 37:24.443
OH, MY GOD. DANNY.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.645
OH, GOD.

37:26.645 --> 37:30.519
OH. MWAH. MM. YOU'RE OKAY.

37:30.519 --> 37:32.551
OH. WHERE'S YOUR MOMMY, PAL?

37:32.551 --> 37:34.753
LET'S GO FIND MOMMY, HUH?

37:34.753 --> 37:36.755
(Meredith) WHEN WE'RE
HEADED TOWARD AN OUTCOME

37:36.755 --> 37:39.458
THAT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO FACE...

37:39.458 --> 37:40.759
(thunder rumbling)

37:40.759 --> 37:42.461
(rainfall)

37:42.461 --> 37:47.265
THAT'S WHEN WE GO LOOKING
FOR A SECOND OPINION.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.839
IT'S NOT THE DOCTORS,
RICHARD.

37:50.839 --> 37:54.403
THEY'RE ALL GOOD DOCTORS.

37:54.403 --> 37:56.975
I KNOW THAT.

37:56.975 --> 38:00.949
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS WAS FOR?

38:00.949 --> 38:04.653
FOR JENNINGS,
IT WAS ABOUT LEGAL.

38:04.653 --> 38:07.616
BUT THIS WAS FOR ME.

38:07.616 --> 38:11.590
I NEEDED TO KNOW
WHO FINALLY WAS RESPONSIBLE.

38:14.323 --> 38:17.065
AT LEAST I WAS ABLE
TO DO THAT.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.730
HMM.

38:21.730 --> 38:24.733
(thunder rumbling)

38:27.636 --> 38:29.578
SAY IT, DEREK.

38:29.578 --> 38:32.681
MAYBE IT'S NOT ONE DOCTOR.

38:32.681 --> 38:35.484
MAYBE IT'S TOO MANY DOCTORS...

38:35.484 --> 38:37.486
WHO DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER

38:37.486 --> 38:39.548
AND WHO DON'T TRUST
EACH OTHER.

38:42.551 --> 38:45.554
WHEN I GOT TO THAT ROOM...

38:45.554 --> 38:48.397
THERE WAS CHAOS.

38:48.397 --> 38:50.629
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE SYSTEM NOW...

38:50.629 --> 38:53.101
CHAOS.

38:53.101 --> 38:55.063
THAT HAS BEEN THE SYSTEM

38:55.063 --> 38:59.368
