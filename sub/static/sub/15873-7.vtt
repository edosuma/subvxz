<i>EMMA: A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister.</i>

00:03.527 --> 00:05.762
<i>And then she asked me to take her place,</i>

00:05.796 --> 00:07.596
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother</i>

00:07.631 --> 00:09.632
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

00:09.666 --> 00:12.201
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

00:12.236 --> 00:14.470
<i>How long could you keep up the lying game?</i>

00:14.505 --> 00:17.006
Rebecca was protecting the secret
that she was your birth mother.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.074
That's why Derek was killed...

00:18.108 --> 00:19.308
to make sure that the truth stay hidden.

00:19.533 --> 00:22.001
If anyone found out that you know

00:22.035 --> 00:24.170
about me and Sutton, your
life could be in danger.

00:24.204 --> 00:25.938
I'll keep your secret, Emma.

00:25.973 --> 00:27.273
I thought you and I had that thing...

00:27.307 --> 00:29.141
- Mads, we do.
- No!

00:29.176 --> 00:31.010
I could use a night off. Come in.

00:32.779 --> 00:34.013
<i>- Good night, Kristin.
- EMMA: I need</i>

00:34.047 --> 00:35.581
<i>to make her think that I'm Sutton.</i>

00:35.616 --> 00:36.716
Maybe she would reveal something.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.817
<i>SUTTON: You drive me all around,</i>

00:37.851 --> 00:39.485
<i>keeping me from the formal.</i>

00:39.519 --> 00:40.786
You two and your schemes.

00:43.657 --> 00:47.259
- I'm really with Thayer now.
- I really know.

00:47.294 --> 00:49.395
<i>KRISTIN: I was going through
your father's finances, and... </i>

00:49.429 --> 00:51.130
he was taking some withdrawals,

00:51.164 --> 00:53.399
adding up to $20,000.

00:53.433 --> 00:55.334
Did you just say $20,000?

00:55.369 --> 00:57.970
Yeah, that's what they
found at Derek's house.

00:58.005 --> 00:59.238
Ted was being blackmailed by Derek.

00:59.272 --> 01:00.239
Ted killed Derek.

01:00.273 --> 01:02.008
Why don't we split this wine

01:02.042 --> 01:03.743
and talk till the sun comes up?

01:03.777 --> 01:05.044
Deal.

01:05.078 --> 01:07.780
I promised that I'll get
you through this, and I will.

01:14.688 --> 01:16.622
♪

01:33.547 --> 01:36.448
Morning.

01:36.483 --> 01:39.118
Hi.

01:39.152 --> 01:41.387
Last night was...

01:43.890 --> 01:47.860
It was... everything I hoped for.

01:49.129 --> 01:51.664
I'm really glad it was with you.

01:53.033 --> 01:55.568
I wish we could spend
the whole day together,

01:55.602 --> 01:57.469
not even get out of bed.

01:57.504 --> 02:01.340
Or... there's actually this
place I want to take you to.

02:02.509 --> 02:04.310
(sighs)

02:04.344 --> 02:06.478
I'm sorry. Of course.

02:06.513 --> 02:08.413
You're thinking about the
other part of last night.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.383
Yeah.

02:11.418 --> 02:14.053
There's just got to be
some sort of explanation.

02:14.087 --> 02:17.923
If Ted is my real father...

02:17.958 --> 02:20.326
I can't believe he would kill someone.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.862
Maybe he wouldn't.

02:22.896 --> 02:25.164
We can't jump to conclusions yet.

02:25.198 --> 02:26.765
I need to talk to Alec.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.900
He said that once he got out of jail,

02:27.934 --> 02:29.034
he would tell me more.

02:29.069 --> 02:30.836
I mean, maybe he knows something.

02:30.871 --> 02:33.005
You can't trust him
though. You can't trust him.

02:38.612 --> 02:40.713
What?

02:40.747 --> 02:42.681
I just think I need to...

02:42.716 --> 02:44.350
explain to Ethan...

02:44.384 --> 02:45.718
at least...

02:45.752 --> 02:48.187
why we didn't go through with the plan.

02:48.221 --> 02:49.455
Or...

02:49.489 --> 02:51.557
you don't.

02:51.591 --> 02:53.525
Maybe you just shouldn't
tell Ethan anything.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.461
Keep this between us.

02:57.931 --> 02:59.899

(sniffs)

03:06.172 --> 03:08.007
(sighs)

03:09.676 --> 03:10.709
You should've used

03:10.744 --> 03:13.612
one of these for a pillow.

03:13.647 --> 03:14.914
I couldn't, really.

03:14.948 --> 03:17.549
You were kind of hogging
'em all over there,

03:17.584 --> 03:19.485
spun yourself a little towel web.

03:19.519 --> 03:21.487
Well, I guess I saw my opportunity

03:21.521 --> 03:24.623
- while you were busy doing weird cowboy impressions.
- Whoa. Whoa.

03:24.658 --> 03:29.228
- Clint Eastwood is not a weird cowboy.
- Whatever.

03:29.262 --> 03:31.430
Got to admit, I never thought
one of my best heart-to-hearts

03:31.464 --> 03:33.299
would be with Ethan Whitehorse.

03:33.438 --> 03:36.407
Maybe we don't need to tell the
guys at school about that, okay?

03:36.441 --> 03:38.242
I'm serious.

03:38.276 --> 03:40.277
You helped me realize I need to...

03:40.311 --> 03:43.213
hear Jordan out and give
him a chance to explain.

03:43.248 --> 03:45.149
I think he's a good guy.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.984
Yeah.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.252
And what about Emma?

03:49.988 --> 03:51.989
You said things didn't
end so well last night.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.992
Mm. You said a lot of things.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.795
That's... probably just the wine talking.

03:59.798 --> 04:00.631
(door opens)

04:00.665 --> 04:01.698
Uh...

04:01.733 --> 04:02.800
we should probably get out of here.

Ethan.

04:19.184 --> 04:21.250
Remember?

04:21.286 --> 04:23.220
Didn't expect to see you here this early.

04:24.355 --> 04:27.891
I was kind of thinking the same thing.

04:27.926 --> 04:29.960

Hmm?

Uh... w... well... uh...

04:32.864 --> 04:34.031

Sutton shows up, you ditch the whole plan.

04:35.867 --> 04:37.034
TED: Sutton.

Oh. H... hey, Dr. Mercer, we...

or will be soon. Come
on, I'm taking you home.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.741
- No, that's okay. I have my car.
- Well, then I think you better get going.

Why didn't you confront Rebecca? I thought

you were positive that she was your mother

spending the night with...

Thayer.

Hmm. We...

05:55.446 --> 05:59.216
- slept together.
- O-M-G!

05:59.250 --> 06:00.484

06:00.518 --> 06:02.186
every detail right now.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.121
Well, not every detail. Gross.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.023
Was it everything you imagined?

06:06.057 --> 06:07.391
'Cause mine was totally
in a squatter house.

talking about losing it, right?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.433
Mm-hmm.

You thought it would be with Ethan.

06:20.138 --> 06:21.338

So...

(sighs) explain.

06:54.439 --> 06:57.207
Rebecca made me take her. Okay?

Hi, Alec. You were up late.

07:11.122 --> 07:13.190
I was out shooting pool
with the boys. Yeah, you were

07:13.224 --> 07:14.358
passed out when I got home. Yes, well,

07:14.392 --> 07:16.360
chaperoning can be exhausting.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.394
I'll bet.

07:18.496 --> 07:20.497
Hey, Jordan. I got a 4:00

07:20.531 --> 07:22.366

other a little better.

REBECCA: You know what?

07:25.336 --> 07:26.436
Um...

07:26.471 --> 07:28.138
I'm sure he's got a busy day...

07:28.172 --> 07:30.240
schoolwork. Maybe another time.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.142
Actually, I'm free today. That'd be fun.

07:32.176 --> 07:33.277
ALEC: Great.

07:33.311 --> 07:34.511
See you out there.

07:34.545 --> 07:36.213

07:36.247 --> 07:37.481
I'm no duffer.

07:46.457 --> 07:48.158
EMMA: Sutton.

07:48.192 --> 07:50.294
Look. About last night...

07:50.328 --> 07:52.162
How could you not tell me

07:52.196 --> 07:53.530
Rebecca is our birth mother?

07:53.564 --> 07:56.099
Did you hear Laurel and I talking?

07:56.134 --> 07:57.334
She knows that we're twins?

07:57.368 --> 07:59.069
What did you tell her?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.304
<i>She's my sister.</i>

08:00.338 --> 08:02.339
- I should be the one to tell her.
- Oh, yeah?

08:02.373 --> 08:04.141
But you didn't. And you
know what? I'm pretty sure

08:04.175 --> 08:05.309
that you're keeping things from me, too.

08:05.343 --> 08:07.778
Searching for our birth mother

08:07.812 --> 08:09.112
is where this all started. It's what

08:09.147 --> 08:10.147
brought us together, Emma.

08:10.181 --> 08:11.715
Drop the act.

08:11.749 --> 08:12.916
You knew about Rebecca.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.519
I didn't. And now I can't even go

08:15.553 --> 08:16.620
and throw my arms around her

08:16.654 --> 08:18.555
because you guys think she's

08:18.589 --> 08:19.656
some killer. And what?

08:19.691 --> 08:21.391
I'm helping her cover it up?

08:21.426 --> 08:23.560
Sutton. If you're so sure

08:23.594 --> 08:25.562
that Rebecca killed Derek,

08:25.596 --> 08:28.265
why didn't you confront her last night?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.400
Okay, look.

08:30.435 --> 08:32.202
I'm really sorry about last night,

08:32.236 --> 08:33.503
everything that happened... tricking you

08:33.538 --> 08:35.405
and screwing things up with Ethan.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.274
Oh, I bet you are.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.176
No, I am.

08:39.210 --> 08:43.046
I really hope that you and
Ethan can make things work.

08:43.081 --> 08:45.816
Why? So you can stop second-guessing

08:45.850 --> 08:47.951
your feelings for Thayer?

08:49.821 --> 08:51.588
I love Thayer.

08:51.622 --> 08:53.490
I've never been happier in my life.

08:53.524 --> 08:55.625
Well, I hope that's true, because if not,

08:55.660 --> 08:57.761
you just gave it up to the wrong guy.

09:03.859 --> 09:05.056
Oh, you're being awfully quiet.

09:07.863 --> 09:09.797
I'm guessing that, uh,

09:09.831 --> 09:12.600
the Flipside Formal of
yours didn't go so well.

09:12.634 --> 09:14.401
Good guess.

09:15.804 --> 09:17.738
Hey, Theresa. Hey.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.409
Hey. I thought we were
having our flowers delivered.

09:22.444 --> 09:24.311
You know we're gonna need
more than that, don't you?

09:24.346 --> 09:26.614
Actually, Derek's mother
brought them by my office.

09:26.648 --> 09:29.216
Apparently, someone's been leaving

09:29.251 --> 09:30.384
flowers at Derek's grave.

09:30.418 --> 09:32.086
Every week or so.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.054
Why'd she give 'em to you?

09:34.089 --> 09:36.357
I guess she trusts us because
we're investigating that money.

09:36.391 --> 09:40.060
But she started thinking
a... and looking back and...

09:40.095 --> 09:41.195
She doesn't know who's been leaving 'em?

09:41.229 --> 09:42.229
No, and she's suspicious.

09:42.264 --> 09:43.931
She asked his girlfriend,

09:43.965 --> 09:45.866
- she asked his friends...
- Okay, well, what...

09:45.901 --> 09:47.801
what are you thinking?

09:47.836 --> 09:50.004
Maybe the guilty conscience of a killer.

09:51.873 --> 09:53.774
We have to stake out that cemetery.

09:53.808 --> 09:55.709
What... Theresa. (chuckles)

09:55.744 --> 09:57.645
Our wedding's in two
days... rehearsal dinner

09:57.679 --> 09:58.913
- tomorrow night, you know?
- Hey, listen,

09:58.947 --> 10:00.748
I'm not saying that we should call it off.

10:00.782 --> 10:01.749
I just...

10:01.783 --> 10:03.384
I have a feeling about this.

10:03.418 --> 10:04.652
(sighs)

10:04.686 --> 10:06.520
I'm really hoping it's not cold feet.

10:06.554 --> 10:08.422
You're not getting cold
feet now on me, okay?

10:08.456 --> 10:10.457
Listen to me. There is
nothing that I want more...

10:11.660 --> 10:13.227
than to be...

10:13.261 --> 10:16.096
Mrs. Dan Whitehorse. (Dan chuckles)

10:16.131 --> 10:17.298
But we could be onto something here.

10:17.332 --> 10:19.300
Can't we do both?

10:22.270 --> 10:24.238
Sure.

10:24.272 --> 10:26.173
I mean, we're a team now, right?

10:26.207 --> 10:28.008
Mmm.

10:29.277 --> 10:32.746
Look, I shouldn't have
fallen into their trap.

10:32.781 --> 10:35.049
I'm sorry, but they did
kidnap me for a reason.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.718
Yes, they think we're working together.

10:37.752 --> 10:40.788
Well, I think it might
be more than that. I...

10:40.822 --> 10:42.957
I think they...

10:42.991 --> 10:45.793
maybe know something
about you that I don't?

10:47.429 --> 10:49.296
What are you suggesting?

10:49.331 --> 10:50.531
I don't know.

10:50.565 --> 10:52.433
I mean, you play all these
games with everyone else.

10:52.467 --> 10:54.301
How do I know you're not
keeping things from me?

10:54.336 --> 10:56.203
You're not everyone else.

10:56.237 --> 10:57.438
You're my daughter.

10:57.472 --> 10:59.907
I would never lie to you.

10:59.941 --> 11:02.977
And I'd hope you'd never
keep anything from me.

11:05.146 --> 11:07.014
Never.

11:07.048 --> 11:10.651
Good, because we are so
close to fulfilling our plan.

11:10.685 --> 11:13.721
Ted and I danced last night,
and we were just one twirl,

11:13.755 --> 11:15.889
one dip away from kissing.

11:15.924 --> 11:16.924
Really?

11:16.958 --> 11:18.592
We are so close

11:18.626 --> 11:21.495
to getting our family back together again.

11:27.268 --> 11:28.569
Hey, you have a second?

11:28.603 --> 11:31.505
I got lots of seconds... Emma.

11:31.539 --> 11:35.275
What's up?

11:35.310 --> 11:37.311
Okay, you said when you got out of jail,

11:37.345 --> 11:39.013
you would tell me more, so...

11:39.047 --> 11:40.914
Yeah, I thought things were gonna be

11:40.949 --> 11:42.316
a little different by now.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.785
Look, I know Rebecca's my birth mother,

11:44.819 --> 11:46.854
and I'm pretty sure Ted is my father.

11:46.888 --> 11:48.889
I think Derek was blackmailing him.

11:48.923 --> 11:49.796
Why?

11:49.797 --> 11:53.145
Because Kristin found $20,000
missing from their accounts.

11:53.150 --> 11:54.595
That's the same amount of money

11:54.629 --> 11:56.697
- that was found at Derek's house, right?
- Yes.

11:56.731 --> 11:58.632
Which means Ted knew about us,

11:58.666 --> 12:01.468
and he was the one that split us up.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.470
My own father was the
reason that I ended up

12:03.505 --> 12:04.638
in foster care.

12:04.672 --> 12:06.306
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

12:06.341 --> 12:07.474
Ted didn't split anybody up.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.410
Ted doesn't even know Sutton has a twin.

12:09.444 --> 12:11.412
How do you know that?

12:15.183 --> 12:18.085
Look, you're right.

12:18.119 --> 12:20.220
Ted is your father.

12:20.255 --> 12:22.122
But he's not a killer.

12:22.157 --> 12:23.824
You know that.

12:23.858 --> 12:25.125
Okay, well, then, you...
you-you went afterwards...

12:25.160 --> 12:26.794
Me, me, me, what?

12:26.828 --> 12:28.729
In case you didn't hear, I was exonerated.

12:28.763 --> 12:30.631
I'm close with your father, but that's...

12:30.665 --> 12:32.066
That's it, all right? Please.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.867
I wouldn't kill for him.

12:33.902 --> 12:35.035
Well, what does Kristin know?

12:35.070 --> 12:36.904
Nothing.

12:36.938 --> 12:38.906
We need to keep it that way.

12:38.940 --> 12:40.808
Can't tell her a thing.

12:40.842 --> 12:42.676
It would break her heart.

12:42.710 --> 12:45.379
Fine, but how am I going to find out... ?

12:45.413 --> 12:48.515
You're not. Just leave it to me.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.118
Okay? The safest thing you can do right n

12:51.152 --> 12:52.286
is just stay out of it.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.022
This is a murder investigation, okay?

12:59.127 --> 13:01.228
(sighs)

13:07.135 --> 13:10.971
So, I thought we agreed that
you weren't going to go to him?

13:11.005 --> 13:14.007
We didn't agree, and I
probably should have told you,

13:14.042 --> 13:16.543
but I know how you feel about him.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.679
Emma, it's not about how I feel anymore.

13:18.713 --> 13:21.381
Look, Thayer, he told me that it was true.

13:21.416 --> 13:23.317
Ted's my father.

13:23.351 --> 13:25.385
- Oh, my God.
- But he's not a killer.

13:25.420 --> 13:26.620
Okay.

13:26.654 --> 13:29.289
I just need answers.

13:29.324 --> 13:31.158
Yeah, we all do.

13:31.192 --> 13:33.293
I'll see you later.

13:33.328 --> 13:36.363
Okay.

13:36.397 --> 13:38.065
What are you doing here? I thought...

13:38.099 --> 13:40.134
I thought you had a golf game to get to?

13:40.168 --> 13:42.236
Can't I stop and tell a
woman she looks beautiful

13:42.270 --> 13:44.171
now that she's finally smiling?

13:46.141 --> 13:48.775
I...

13:48.810 --> 13:50.944
I have to change for
tennis with Sutton, and...

13:50.979 --> 13:53.580
I don't understand what's going on.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.716
I thought last night
you... you were going to...

13:55.750 --> 13:57.417
I was.

13:57.452 --> 13:59.786
It took everything I had not to.

13:59.821 --> 14:02.656
Kristin, I'm not going to make a move

14:02.690 --> 14:04.458
until I know it's what you want.

14:04.492 --> 14:07.528
You need to do something
to make yourself happy.

14:09.130 --> 14:10.497
Just for once.

14:34.789 --> 14:37.391
<i>EMMA: Mads.</i>

14:37.425 --> 14:39.326
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you. Uh...

14:39.360 --> 14:40.627
Look, about last night...

14:40.662 --> 14:42.462
Laurel told me. Rebecca's
your birth mother.

14:42.497 --> 14:44.331
Yeah, but that's not...

14:44.365 --> 14:47.334
Look, I don't even want to
know what you guys were up to.

14:47.368 --> 14:50.204
Look, I'm really sorry
that we didn't include you.

14:50.238 --> 14:52.172
Well, my night turned out fine.

14:52.207 --> 14:54.274
Oh. So, you and Jordan?

14:54.309 --> 14:55.976
No.

14:56.214 --> 14:58.249
I'm gonna go grab a bite.

14:58.283 --> 14:59.483
I'll see you later.

14:59.518 --> 15:01.485
Hi.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.088
Come on, let's talk.

15:04.122 --> 15:06.157
You tell me what happened last night.

15:06.191 --> 15:09.326
I can't.

15:09.361 --> 15:10.995
No?

15:11.029 --> 15:12.263
Oh, I get it.

15:12.297 --> 15:14.031
It's you and Thayer now, right?

15:14.065 --> 15:16.700
You spend the night with him,

15:16.735 --> 15:18.669
tell him everything, leave me in the dark?

15:18.703 --> 15:19.837
Ethan, come on. It's not like that.

15:19.871 --> 15:21.038
Well, that's sure what it seems like.

15:21.072 --> 15:24.842
I mean, I broke up with
Sutton for you... again.

15:24.876 --> 15:28.512
I've trusted you, I did
everything you asked me to,

15:28.547 --> 15:30.681
and none of it matters.

15:31.817 --> 15:33.751
You know... you know what?

15:33.785 --> 15:36.687
Maybe you and Sutton aren't
that different after all.

15:36.721 --> 15:39.323
Maybe that's what it is.

15:39.357 --> 15:41.192
How can you say that?

15:41.226 --> 15:45.029
I care about you so much, you have no idea.

15:45.063 --> 15:46.330
You're right. I don't.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.332
I'm tired of wishing I did.

15:48.366 --> 15:50.201
Please?

15:50.235 --> 15:51.969
No.

15:52.003 --> 15:54.004
I'm not doing this anymore.

16:00.705 --> 16:03.073
(sniffling, crying)

16:03.107 --> 16:05.709
Emma?

16:05.743 --> 16:06.910
What's wrong?

16:06.944 --> 16:08.712
(whimpers)

16:08.746 --> 16:10.780
Something happen with Sutton?

16:10.815 --> 16:13.483
No. It's just...

16:13.517 --> 16:15.452
Thayer?

16:15.486 --> 16:17.687
I thought what happened
with him was a good thing.

16:19.690 --> 16:22.258
So did I.

16:22.293 --> 16:25.428
But why do I keep thinking about Ethan?

16:25.463 --> 16:27.097
(sniffles)

16:27.131 --> 16:29.232
I don't know.

16:29.266 --> 16:33.169
I mean... he obviously
still has feelings for you.

16:33.204 --> 16:36.139
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
turned on Sutton at the formal.

16:36.173 --> 16:41.011
But... Thayer's really sweet, so...

16:42.680 --> 16:44.614
Yeah, he's... he's sweet.

16:44.648 --> 16:46.549
That's why I slept with him.

16:46.584 --> 16:48.685
Hmm.

16:48.719 --> 16:50.887
Oh, you need to be honest with him.

16:50.921 --> 16:52.689
(sighs)

16:52.723 --> 16:56.326
And yourself... before somebody gets hurt.

16:59.463 --> 17:02.298
(sniffles)

17:03.501 --> 17:06.102
Good putt.

17:06.137 --> 17:07.369
Don't sweat it, kid.

17:07.405 --> 17:09.973
The important thing is,
you accepted the invite.

17:10.007 --> 17:12.008
A lot of people find me intimidating,

17:12.042 --> 17:13.943
although I have no idea why.

17:13.978 --> 17:15.310
I see no reason to be intimidated.

17:15.346 --> 17:17.847
Maybe it's because you're
a little more ballsy

17:17.882 --> 17:19.816
than most guys interested in my daughter.

17:22.053 --> 17:24.954
Yeah, that's right. I knew.

17:24.989 --> 17:27.656
Which is why I was a little surprised

17:27.691 --> 17:28.925
at your last-minute decision

17:28.959 --> 17:31.661
to invite Laurel Mercer to the formal.

17:31.695 --> 17:33.730
- I'm a last minute kind of guy.
- Really?

17:33.764 --> 17:37.500
Or maybe it wasn't your idea at all.

17:37.535 --> 17:40.537
Maybe it was Rebecca's.

17:42.173 --> 17:44.340
I know about your past.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.242
Your bad boy days in L.A.

17:46.277 --> 17:49.245
Mama had to bail you out
more than once, didn't she?

17:49.280 --> 17:51.047
You don't know what you're talking about.

17:51.082 --> 17:52.982
Why don't you enlighten me?

17:53.017 --> 17:55.151
'Cause I sure would love to know.

17:56.921 --> 17:59.155
If you're in trouble with Rebecca,

17:59.190 --> 18:01.791
if she's got you under her thumb,

18:01.826 --> 18:03.760
I can help you out.

18:03.794 --> 18:05.929
Think about it.

18:05.963 --> 18:08.565
When you're ready to talk, I'm all ears.

18:11.735 --> 18:14.370
Hey, I've been looking for you.

18:14.405 --> 18:16.339
I want to finish our
conversation about Rebecca.

18:16.373 --> 18:18.441
- Why? So you can go tell your dad?
- My dad?

18:18.476 --> 18:20.543
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Then how'd he know

18:20.578 --> 18:22.345
Rebecca made me take Laurel to formal, huh?

18:22.379 --> 18:24.347
I have no idea, Jordan.

18:25.316 --> 18:26.382
I swear.

18:31.989 --> 18:34.057
<i>REBECCA: I didn't know who to talk to.</i>

18:34.091 --> 18:35.291
MAN: Last call!

18:35.326 --> 18:36.960
What? What are you talking about?

18:40.965 --> 18:43.600
Your wife kissed my husband.

18:50.508 --> 18:52.609
Where did you hear that?

18:52.643 --> 18:56.412
I saw it... right here

18:56.447 --> 19:00.416
today at the club, actually.

19:00.418 --> 19:02.552
I'm so sorry.

19:04.412 --> 19:05.321
This affects me, too.

19:07.124 --> 19:10.360
I promise, I couldn't lie
about something like this.

19:15.332 --> 19:18.768
Maybe this is just what
we needed, some time alone.

19:18.802 --> 19:20.904
Yeah.

19:20.938 --> 19:23.039
I think you're right.

19:26.644 --> 19:28.811
You okay?

19:28.846 --> 19:30.580
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

19:30.614 --> 19:32.916
I've got a lot on my mind.

19:32.950 --> 19:34.717
No. I get it.

19:34.752 --> 19:36.653
- It's been a crazy couple of days.
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.687 --> 19:38.788
The stuff with Ted.

19:41.625 --> 19:44.594
Are you sure that's what this is about?

19:46.463 --> 19:48.097
It's not about us?

19:48.132 --> 19:50.166
No.

19:51.335 --> 19:53.069
No.

19:53.103 --> 19:55.238
Promise.

20:02.213 --> 20:04.080
<i>REBECCA: So, I told him that</i>

20:04.114 --> 20:06.082
I saw them kissing with my own eyes,

20:06.116 --> 20:08.718
and it was the truth. It
was like a dream come true.

20:08.752 --> 20:13.489
So, you hate Kristin so much

20:13.524 --> 20:15.525
that you don't care that she's
getting close to a killer?

20:18.495 --> 20:20.663
Well... no,

20:20.698 --> 20:22.665
that's not what I'm saying.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.368
But you still think
Alec killed Derek, right?

20:25.402 --> 20:27.337
Well, of course. I mean,

20:27.371 --> 20:30.173
who else wanted to protect the
secret of the twins so badly

20:30.207 --> 20:32.342
they'd kill for it?

20:32.376 --> 20:34.944
Well...

20:34.979 --> 20:38.014
you.

20:38.048 --> 20:40.016
(sighs heavily)

20:40.050 --> 20:42.118
So you really think I
could be capable of... ?

20:42.152 --> 20:44.988
I don't know what to think,

20:45.022 --> 20:47.690
because Alec was let off,

20:47.725 --> 20:49.559
so, some people obviously
think he's innocent.

20:49.593 --> 20:51.728
And I'm not one of them.

20:51.762 --> 20:53.563
I know in my heart that he killed Derek.

20:53.597 --> 20:55.665
How do you know that? How are you so sure?

20:55.699 --> 20:58.668
Because, I mean, splitting
up you and Emma...

20:58.702 --> 21:00.470
it's horrifying.

21:00.504 --> 21:02.605
I still can't comprehend
why he would do that.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.575
So you think that Alec
would actually kill somebody

21:05.609 --> 21:08.344
just so nobody finds
out that he split us up?

21:08.379 --> 21:11.080
It's the only explanation that makes sense.

21:11.115 --> 21:13.149
Ted, Kristin, even Mads and Thayer...

21:13.183 --> 21:15.285
they would never forgive
him if they knew it.

21:15.319 --> 21:17.253
Not to mention, he's the D.A.

21:17.288 --> 21:19.022
He would lose his whole life.

21:19.056 --> 21:22.292
Somebody still framed him, though.

21:22.326 --> 21:26.129
Well, I... I may have gone a little too far

21:26.163 --> 21:27.964
with making sure that he actually paid

21:27.998 --> 21:29.632
for his crime this time.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.868
What did you do?

21:31.902 --> 21:34.837
Look, I am not the only one out there

21:34.872 --> 21:38.541
that wants to see Alec go down.

21:38.575 --> 21:40.543
Someone sent me the photograph

21:40.577 --> 21:41.811
of Alec with the murder weapon,

21:41.845 --> 21:43.780
and the tire iron just showed up

21:43.814 --> 21:47.250
in my bedroom with a note on it, saying...

21:47.284 --> 21:50.253
"Thought you could use this," so... I did.

21:50.287 --> 21:53.256
<i>So you're telling me you framed Alec,</i>

21:53.290 --> 21:56.225
but... but now there's just
someone out there pulling strings

21:56.260 --> 21:58.961
like some... what, uber-villain?

21:58.996 --> 22:00.363
Or uber... hero.

22:00.397 --> 22:03.232
This is crazy... I am trusting
you, I am lying to Emma,

22:03.267 --> 22:06.135
- I have lost Ethan...
- But not much longer, okay?

22:06.170 --> 22:09.072
<i>I-I'm just this close with Ted, okay?</i>

22:09.106 --> 22:11.636
I will tell him everything, and then...

22:12.387 --> 22:13.904
we can tell Emma.

22:20.702 --> 22:22.703
I got your text.

22:23.939 --> 22:25.873
What, are we burying a body or...

22:25.907 --> 22:27.808
digging one up?

22:27.843 --> 22:30.611
Did you kiss my wife?

22:33.548 --> 22:35.349
Yes, I did.

22:37.452 --> 22:39.520
You bastard!

22:39.554 --> 22:42.990
You're supposed to be my friend.

22:43.024 --> 22:44.358
I'm the one who tried to help you.

22:44.392 --> 22:46.160
Yeah, 17 years ago.

22:46.194 --> 22:49.964
It was the best thing
anybody ever did for you.

22:52.801 --> 22:55.069
<i>So, Rebecca comes to you,
tells you she's pregnant,</i>

22:55.103 --> 22:57.037
doesn't want me to know.

22:57.072 --> 23:00.107
And I made sure you did, didn't I?

23:00.141 --> 23:02.922
So you could adopt Sutton
without Kristin or Rebecca

23:02.923 --> 23:06.547
- knowing about it.
- Which is just as stupid now as it was then.

23:06.581 --> 23:07.948
It gave you a beautiful family.

23:07.983 --> 23:11.452
Which you're trying to destroy!

23:11.486 --> 23:13.554
And I get it, I get it.

23:13.588 --> 23:16.590
Oh, I complain, you go to Kristin,
tell her all about it, huh?

23:16.625 --> 23:20.327
- Is that it?
- That doesn't make any sense.

23:20.362 --> 23:23.430
She'd be just as upset with
me as she would be with you.

23:23.465 --> 23:25.566
- I have to come clean.
- Oh, no.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.236
- I have to come clean.
- No, no, that's not a good idea.

23:27.237 --> 23:28.237
You don't want to do that.

23:28.637 --> 23:31.038
And nail your coffin shut from the inside?

23:31.072 --> 23:33.240
I think you're trying to keep this
thing buried. You're doing everything

23:33.275 --> 23:35.309
you can to make sure it
stays that way, aren't you?

23:35.343 --> 23:36.977
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

23:37.012 --> 23:40.180
You made a mess out of Kristin.

23:40.215 --> 23:43.183
Somebody's got to take care of her.

23:43.218 --> 23:46.720
And that's exactly what I intend to do.

23:50.859 --> 23:54.495
(car door opens)

23:54.529 --> 23:55.629
(door closes)

23:55.664 --> 23:56.797
(engine starts)

24:01.636 --> 24:04.538
(insects chirping)

24:07.542 --> 24:09.510
I thought I heard something.

24:09.544 --> 24:12.246
(sighs) Sorry.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.115
Are you okay?

24:15.150 --> 24:17.985
Couldn't sleep.

24:18.019 --> 24:20.020
Did something happen with Ethan?

24:20.890 --> 24:23.090
I... I never heard how the formal went.

24:24.225 --> 24:26.160
Um, it's not about Ethan.

24:26.194 --> 24:28.796
I'm actually with...

24:28.830 --> 24:30.898
Thayer now.

24:31.967 --> 24:33.667
Really?

24:33.702 --> 24:34.935
Yeah.

24:34.970 --> 24:37.905
It's just a lot of crazy
stuff that happened.

24:37.939 --> 24:39.740
I understand this, I do.

24:39.774 --> 24:42.309
I... I want to try and help.

24:42.344 --> 24:44.278
I know you read that journal, and...

24:44.312 --> 24:47.247
this thing with Alec
goes back to high school,

24:47.282 --> 24:48.582
and like you with Ethan and Thayer,

24:48.617 --> 24:51.518
I always knew my life
could go one of two ways.

24:51.553 --> 24:54.254
But you chose Dad.

24:56.124 --> 24:58.359
Because you trusted him, right?

24:58.393 --> 25:00.227
<i>Well, I used to.</i>

25:00.261 --> 25:02.997
I tried to deny my feelings for Alec

25:03.031 --> 25:07.868
because they were scary, but
I can't deny they were also...

25:07.902 --> 25:10.037
they were exciting, too.

25:10.071 --> 25:11.672
- Mom...
- Alec was never

25:11.706 --> 25:13.607
the right choice, he never fit this image

25:13.642 --> 25:16.577
of how my life, my perfect
life was supposed to be,

25:16.611 --> 25:19.713
and look what happened...
it just blew up anyway.

25:19.748 --> 25:22.750
I'm so tired of caring about
what other people think,

25:22.784 --> 25:24.518
trying to be a good girl.

25:24.552 --> 25:28.255
I... I'm sorry, I know you
love your father, but...

25:28.289 --> 25:31.225
my wish for you is that

25:31.259 --> 25:33.160
you not worry about getting it right

25:33.194 --> 25:36.263
and just go after what is real.

25:39.401 --> 25:41.168
(insects chittering, chirping)

25:41.202 --> 25:43.837
Damn, I'm hungry; how about you?

25:43.872 --> 25:45.873
(sighs): I'm fine.

25:45.907 --> 25:49.743
I could call in some, uh... pizza.

25:49.778 --> 25:50.878
Stop it.

25:50.912 --> 25:52.613
I have to fit into

25:52.647 --> 25:54.848
a wedding dress in... in 36 hours.

25:54.883 --> 25:57.685
Yeah, you know, speaking
of which, what do you say

25:57.719 --> 25:59.687
we forget about all this for, I don't know,

25:59.721 --> 26:02.556
Mm. 37 hours, just...
just until we're married.

26:02.590 --> 26:04.591
Then after that, if you want,

26:04.626 --> 26:07.361
we can spend our entire
honeymoon staking out this place?

26:07.395 --> 26:09.229
You would do that for me?

26:09.264 --> 26:10.397
Sure, absolutely.

26:10.432 --> 26:11.532
I want to solve this case, too.

26:11.566 --> 26:13.133
I know how important it is to you.

26:13.168 --> 26:15.135
It's just...

26:15.170 --> 26:18.072
I got Alec off, and we still
haven't found the killer.

26:18.106 --> 26:20.207
- So until we do...
- I know. It's just...

26:20.241 --> 26:23.877
we let stuff like this
come between us before...

26:23.912 --> 26:26.714
and I don't want to let that happen again.

26:26.748 --> 26:28.749
That's why I have to solve this.

26:28.783 --> 26:31.018
So we can put everything
with Alec behind us

26:31.052 --> 26:34.555
- and we can just start our life again.
- And we will.

26:34.589 --> 26:37.391
But just promise me,

26:37.425 --> 26:40.661
for the next two days...
it's just you and me.

26:40.695 --> 26:42.529
Okay.

26:42.564 --> 26:43.630
Okay. Deal.

26:43.665 --> 26:45.466
Come on.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.468
(insects chittering, chirping)

26:47.502 --> 26:49.403
Kristin?

26:50.472 --> 26:52.039
- Ted?
- Kristin.

26:52.073 --> 26:53.240
What the hell are you doing?

26:53.274 --> 26:55.008
You can't just keep letting yourself

26:55.043 --> 26:58.112
- in here like that.
- What the hell are you doing kissing Alec?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.181
- Who told you that?
- Yeah, stop,

27:01.216 --> 27:02.950
this isn't high school, even though that's

27:02.984 --> 27:04.885
- exactly how you're acting.
- How dare you!

27:04.919 --> 27:06.086
After everything...

27:06.121 --> 27:08.155
God, I am so sick of
your sanctimonious crap

27:08.189 --> 27:10.924
about something that happened 17 years ago!

27:10.959 --> 27:12.926
I'm not talking about that.

27:12.961 --> 27:13.961
I hired an accountant to go through

27:13.995 --> 27:15.829
our bank records, just so I'd know

27:15.864 --> 27:16.897
what to expect.

27:16.931 --> 27:21.468
They found the money: $20,000.

27:21.503 --> 27:23.403
Either you are a drug
addict, you're gambling,

27:23.438 --> 27:24.671
<i>or you are having another affair,</i>

27:24.706 --> 27:26.640
which I can understand... you need the cash

27:26.674 --> 27:28.475
- for the motels...
- I'm not having an affair.

27:28.510 --> 27:31.145
I don't care!

27:31.179 --> 27:35.249
I've been carrying these
in my purse for a while.

27:35.283 --> 27:37.117
Since before therapy.

27:37.152 --> 27:38.418
I thought maybe...

27:38.453 --> 27:41.388
I kept hoping...

27:41.422 --> 27:43.090
but the truth is, I'm done.

27:45.126 --> 27:46.260
The marriage is over.

27:48.897 --> 27:50.831
Because of Alec?

27:50.865 --> 27:51.899
No.

27:51.933 --> 27:53.167
Because of me.

27:54.736 --> 27:55.903
Mom?

27:59.974 --> 28:00.841
Honey...

28:00.909 --> 28:01.909
Sweetie...

28:01.943 --> 28:03.577
- Honey...
- Get away from me.

28:03.611 --> 28:05.712
<i>THAYER: Hey. Sorry about
the other night, man.</i>

28:05.697 --> 28:06.764
Plan kind of went bust.

28:06.798 --> 28:08.565
I know you're in the dark now.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.300
That's fine by me.

28:10.335 --> 28:11.535
Good. 'Cause, you know,

28:11.569 --> 28:13.570
Emma's in a real fragile place right now.

28:13.605 --> 28:15.405
She doesn't really...
she doesn't really want

28:15.440 --> 28:17.341
a lot of people in her hair.

28:17.375 --> 28:20.144
- Trust me, I'm not in her hair.
- Okay.

28:20.178 --> 28:23.447
I just hope it doesn't bother you
knowing that she trusts me instead of you.

28:23.481 --> 28:25.349
So that's what this is about?

28:25.383 --> 28:26.917
(chuckles) Yeah.

28:26.951 --> 28:28.285
But you're not bothered, right?

28:29.888 --> 28:31.155
Just forget I mentioned it.

28:31.189 --> 28:33.157
Oh, but you did.

28:33.191 --> 28:34.792
Well, then my mistake.

28:34.826 --> 28:36.126
Well, I guess mine was

28:36.161 --> 28:38.695
letting Emma talk me into this.

28:38.730 --> 28:42.900
No, yours was thinking you can screw her
sister and still get her to take you back.

28:42.934 --> 28:44.668
Is that a touchy subject?

28:44.702 --> 28:46.637
(punch lands)

28:46.671 --> 28:47.638
(grunting)

28:47.672 --> 28:49.640
(panting)

28:49.674 --> 28:51.742
You better get used to that pain.

28:51.776 --> 28:54.711
That's how it's gonna feel
when Emma dumps your ass.

29:04.319 --> 29:05.652
Hey. Hey.

29:05.687 --> 29:09.223
Um... I just wanted to
apologize for last night.

29:09.257 --> 29:10.324
My head was just...

29:11.326 --> 29:13.427
What happened?

29:13.461 --> 29:15.129
I... I just...

29:16.231 --> 29:17.998
I got into a fight with Ethan.

29:18.033 --> 29:19.233
I think he's pissed that we're together.

29:19.267 --> 29:22.236
But we've been together for a while now.

29:22.270 --> 29:23.871
I... if he was pissed,

29:23.905 --> 29:25.806
he...

29:25.840 --> 29:27.808
Did you tell him that we slept together?

29:27.842 --> 29:29.810
No. No, of course not.

29:29.844 --> 29:32.946
Okay? But would it really be
that big of a deal even if I did?

29:32.981 --> 29:35.649
- Why do you care so much if he knows?
- Because it's...

29:35.683 --> 29:37.851
it's private and it's between us

29:37.886 --> 29:39.686
and it... it was...

29:41.756 --> 29:42.823
It...

29:42.857 --> 29:44.625
I can't talk about this.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.460
Emma, come on.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.562
Emma.

29:48.596 --> 29:50.631
(exhales)

29:50.665 --> 29:53.434
Before Laurel begins, I'd
like to say a few words.

29:53.468 --> 29:56.603
Mostly, I want to say how
proud I am of my brother...

29:56.638 --> 29:58.372
for not settling,

29:58.406 --> 30:01.442
for biding his time...

30:01.476 --> 30:03.477
letting Theresa come crawling back.

30:03.511 --> 30:06.080
(laughter)

30:06.114 --> 30:08.148
ETHAN: No. Um...

30:09.150 --> 30:10.918
(laughs softly)

30:10.952 --> 30:12.886
It's an amazing thing...

30:12.921 --> 30:15.022
to find love you thought you lost.

30:17.192 --> 30:20.060
You know, you got to... you
got to grab it while you can

30:20.095 --> 30:22.796
and hold on tight...

30:22.831 --> 30:24.832
realize...

30:24.866 --> 30:28.535
what you want... before it's too late.

30:31.639 --> 30:32.773
So, uh, everyone,

30:32.807 --> 30:34.441
please join me,

30:34.476 --> 30:36.477
raise a bottle, or can.

30:36.511 --> 30:39.346
To Dan and Theresa,

30:39.380 --> 30:40.447
long may you love.

30:40.482 --> 30:42.382
OTHERS: Hear, hear!

30:42.417 --> 30:43.517
(people clapping)

30:51.059 --> 30:53.193
(phone vibrating)

30:59.200 --> 31:01.768
Are you okay? (exhales)

31:04.772 --> 31:05.973
- Mm.
- Oh...

31:06.007 --> 31:07.975
Laurel, what's going on?

31:08.009 --> 31:10.644
(sigh)

31:12.614 --> 31:15.349
(crying) My parents are getting a divorce.

31:16.618 --> 31:18.552
Sutton and I...

31:18.586 --> 31:21.221
Emma and I... tried,

31:21.256 --> 31:24.091
but...

31:24.125 --> 31:25.526
I shouldn't even be telling you this,

31:25.560 --> 31:28.462
but I'm just so sick of all the secrets.

31:28.496 --> 31:30.397
Wait, wh... what are you talking about?

31:30.431 --> 31:32.166
(sighs heavily)

31:34.002 --> 31:37.171
My mom said something
about kissing your dad.

31:37.205 --> 31:42.776
My... dad is married to Rebecca.

31:42.810 --> 31:44.845
Yes. And that's only the beginning

31:44.879 --> 31:47.881
of my problems with this whole thing.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.584
Has he...

31:50.618 --> 31:53.820
said anything, or are he and Rebecca...

31:53.855 --> 31:56.523
I have no idea.

31:56.558 --> 31:59.426
Well... good news for you:

31:59.460 --> 32:01.361
if Alec and Rebecca get divorced,

32:01.396 --> 32:03.230
then Jordan won't be
your stepbrother anymore,

32:03.264 --> 32:05.599
and you'll be free to date
the hottest guy in town.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.367
Laurel...

32:07.402 --> 32:09.536
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:09.571 --> 32:11.205
I... I...

32:14.309 --> 32:16.243
There you are.

32:16.277 --> 32:18.879
You disappeared on me.

32:18.913 --> 32:21.048
- I... I'm feeling a little woozy.
- Yeah?

32:21.082 --> 32:23.750
Pregnant? (laughs)

32:23.785 --> 32:25.052
Hmm. Wouldn't that be something?

32:25.086 --> 32:26.753
- Yes.
- Yeah.

32:26.788 --> 32:28.589
- Mm-hmm.
- No. I called a cab.

32:28.623 --> 32:30.657
- You sure? I'll take you home.
- No, please. Uh...

32:30.692 --> 32:32.593
Stay enjoy yourself. (brakes squeak)

32:32.627 --> 32:34.595
Have fun. In fact... (horn toots)

32:34.629 --> 32:36.396
the cab's here now.

32:36.431 --> 32:37.598
Right.

32:37.632 --> 32:39.766
- I'll, uh, see you.
- Okay.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.177
Hey.

32:53.181 --> 32:55.148
I want you to know

32:55.183 --> 32:57.417
that I really did not tell my dad

32:57.452 --> 33:00.220
about you and Rebecca and Laurel.

33:00.255 --> 33:02.856
I would never do that.

33:02.890 --> 33:05.859
(Laurel begins singing in background)

33:05.893 --> 33:08.028
I really like you.

33:09.130 --> 33:11.064
And I thought you liked me, too.

33:11.099 --> 33:12.866
I did.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.801
I do.

33:14.836 --> 33:17.638
I just...

33:17.672 --> 33:19.606
What did my dad say?

33:19.641 --> 33:22.542
'Cause I've kind of
been all over the place,

33:22.577 --> 33:24.544
not trusting him, and
then trusting him again,

33:24.579 --> 33:25.746
but now I'm starting to think

33:25.780 --> 33:27.514
that that was a mistake because Laurel...

33:27.548 --> 33:29.383
It wasn't a mistake.

33:29.417 --> 33:33.453
You should trust him,
'cause he offered to help me.

33:33.488 --> 33:35.155
With what? Rebecca?

33:36.457 --> 33:39.993
(sighs)

33:40.028 --> 33:42.296
What does she have over you?

33:45.333 --> 33:47.934
She came along after my mom left.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.172
Some stuff had...

33:53.941 --> 33:56.677
my family got torn apart.

33:56.711 --> 33:58.845
I started getting into trouble.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.481
She helped my dad.

34:01.606 --> 34:02.973
She helped me.

34:03.007 --> 34:05.575
That's why I thought I could trust her, but

34:05.610 --> 34:08.844
now she's using what I did against me.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.647
She threatened me to tell my dad,

34:10.681 --> 34:13.617
not to mention the police,
if I don't do what she asks.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.523
And what does she ask you to do?

34:19.556 --> 34:21.525
I can't, Mads.

34:21.559 --> 34:26.062
I've already said too much.

34:26.097 --> 34:28.264
I don't want to lose you.

34:28.299 --> 34:30.934
I don't.

34:30.967 --> 34:34.170
But you have to be okay with
me not telling you about this.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.806
Why?

34:36.841 --> 34:38.175
Is there... ?

34:38.208 --> 34:40.777
I mean, my God, what does she make you... ?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.045
Mads...

34:45.016 --> 34:47.516
(sighs)

34:48.619 --> 34:50.887
- You know what? Forget it.
- No.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.556
Wait. I'm sorry.

34:54.725 --> 34:57.360
Me, too.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.441
<i>DAN: Call me crazy,</i>

35:01.476 --> 35:03.176
but this is supposed to be

35:03.211 --> 35:05.112
the most important night of our lives.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.513
- And it is.
- But...

35:06.547 --> 35:09.149
you can't stop thinking about that case.

35:09.183 --> 35:11.284
What if we're missing it right now?

35:11.319 --> 35:13.153
Rebecca left early.

35:13.187 --> 35:14.988
Did you see that?

35:15.022 --> 35:17.090
What if she's at Derek's grave right now?

35:17.125 --> 35:20.160
Theresa, you promised me two days.

35:20.194 --> 35:21.962
We're so close to getting answers,

35:21.996 --> 35:23.830
and the answers are at
the cemetery. (applause)

35:23.865 --> 35:26.700
LAUREL: Thank you.

35:26.734 --> 35:28.034
Hey, it was a nice job.

35:28.069 --> 35:29.836
Thanks.

35:29.871 --> 35:31.838
I hope you guys have a
great wedding tomorrow.

35:31.873 --> 35:33.940
Yeah. Well, apparently,

35:33.975 --> 35:36.543
it is the best man's responsibility

35:36.577 --> 35:38.478
to take care of the bill.

35:38.513 --> 35:40.447
Oh. So...

35:40.481 --> 35:41.882
Here you go.

35:41.916 --> 35:44.484
I'll give you the friends and family rate.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.520
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:46.554 --> 35:47.788
All right, thanks.

35:49.791 --> 35:54.327
Listen, um... I really loved your speech.

35:56.297 --> 35:58.398
It kind of busted me up because...

35:58.433 --> 36:01.234
things with my parents are sort of...

36:01.269 --> 36:03.470
busted.

36:03.504 --> 36:06.106
Oh. I'm sorry. That sucks.

36:06.140 --> 36:09.009
Yeah.

36:09.043 --> 36:11.978
I don't know. So many things
have been going wrong lately

36:12.013 --> 36:14.781
that I... I feel like I should be

36:14.816 --> 36:18.852
doing my part to... I
don't know... make sure

36:18.886 --> 36:21.021
something goes right.

36:23.724 --> 36:26.793
Emma would kill me if she...

36:26.828 --> 36:29.629
I mean, 'cause she's...
she's with Thayer now.

36:29.664 --> 36:32.399
- I mean, she's totally with Thayer. Like...
- Laurel?

36:32.433 --> 36:34.701
Just talk.

36:35.837 --> 36:38.338
She's not over you.

36:38.372 --> 36:40.574
(sighs)

36:40.608 --> 36:43.276
Not by a long shot.

36:43.311 --> 36:44.544
Come on.

36:44.579 --> 36:47.347
I talked to her yesterday at the club.

36:47.381 --> 36:50.350
If you really meant what
you said in your speech

36:50.384 --> 36:52.385
about...

36:52.420 --> 36:55.956
going after what you
want and not letting go...

36:58.292 --> 37:00.894
you should go after Emma.

37:02.029 --> 37:04.097
(sighs)

37:07.455 --> 37:10.523
You know that I can get
a little... obsessed.

37:11.727 --> 37:12.994
(laughs) Oh, I know.

37:13.029 --> 37:16.064
It was such a good
night. I didn't mean to...

37:16.098 --> 37:17.932
Theresa, stop. I love you.

37:17.967 --> 37:21.503
You don't have to apologize to me.

37:21.537 --> 37:23.638
Okay. Well, how about I just...

37:23.673 --> 37:25.473
I just marry you instead?

37:25.508 --> 37:26.741
Oh.

37:26.776 --> 37:28.476
Oh, come on, stay with me.

37:28.511 --> 37:29.644
- No.
- Please?

37:29.679 --> 37:31.479
No!

37:31.514 --> 37:33.515
No! No. It's bad luck
for the bride and groom

37:33.549 --> 37:35.283
to see each other before the wedding.

37:35.317 --> 37:37.419
Yeah, all right.

37:38.654 --> 37:40.388
Thank you for saying yes.

37:40.423 --> 37:43.058
Thank you for asking.

37:44.460 --> 37:46.161
Mmm.

37:46.195 --> 37:47.962
All right, go.

37:47.997 --> 37:49.097
See you at the altar.

37:49.131 --> 37:51.266
Yeah.

38:01.777 --> 38:05.947
Wow. I never thought
she would do this to you.

38:05.981 --> 38:08.550
I'm so sorry.

38:08.584 --> 38:11.553
Is there anything I can do, Ted?

38:15.825 --> 38:18.760
I want a night like thones we had in L.A.

38:27.603 --> 38:30.538
Just... it can't be like this, okay?

38:30.573 --> 38:33.241
It has to be for the
right reasons this time.

38:33.275 --> 38:35.009
Okay.

38:35.044 --> 38:36.311
Okay, so much has happened, and...

38:36.345 --> 38:38.980
and I've... I've done things.

38:39.014 --> 38:41.116
I've done things, too.

38:41.150 --> 38:43.785
Some day I'll tell you everything.

38:50.693 --> 38:52.660
<i>ALEC: Rebecca's probablz asleep.
Said she wasn't feeling well.</i>

38:53.996 --> 38:55.930
Honey, I, uh...

38:55.965 --> 38:58.933
I saw you and Jordan
talking earlier at the party.

38:58.968 --> 39:01.436
Looked kind of intense. Everything okay?

39:01.470 --> 39:03.371
Yeah. Everything's great.

39:03.405 --> 39:05.340
Yeah?

39:05.374 --> 39:08.510
Look, Dad, I really can't tell you.

39:09.645 --> 39:12.347
That's cool. I get it.

39:12.381 --> 39:15.316
I just want you to know, I
care about him, too, and...

39:15.351 --> 39:16.484
if there's anything bothering you,

39:16.519 --> 39:19.087
you can always come and talk to me.

39:22.258 --> 39:27.061
Jordan just did some stuff in the past.

39:27.096 --> 39:29.097
- What kind of stuff?
- I don't know.

39:29.131 --> 39:31.966
But what's scary is,

39:32.001 --> 39:35.069
whatever Rebecca is making
him do because of it.

39:35.104 --> 39:37.972
- Dad, I know she's your wife...
- It's okay.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.942
Look, honey, we all do things
we regret from time to time.

39:40.976 --> 39:42.911
Mm-hmm.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.848
Well, I'm going to head up.

39:46.882 --> 39:48.716
Okay.

39:48.751 --> 39:50.685
Good night.

39:50.719 --> 39:53.388
Good night.

39:58.727 --> 40:01.396
(door closes)

40:14.043 --> 40:16.211
(phone ringing)

40:16.245 --> 40:18.413
(door opening)

40:18.447 --> 40:20.982
- What are you doing here?
- Thayer's calling.

40:21.016 --> 40:22.250
You want to answer it?

40:24.019 --> 40:26.154
Look, can this wait?

40:26.188 --> 40:28.089
'Cause it's been a really hard night.

40:28.123 --> 40:31.860
Kristin is filing for
divorce, Laurel's devastated.

40:31.894 --> 40:33.161
So why isn't Thayer here with you?

40:35.097 --> 40:38.032
It... I told you, it's
been a really crazy night.

40:38.067 --> 40:40.001
(sighs)

40:40.035 --> 40:41.936
All right, listen,

40:41.971 --> 40:45.773
you tell me right now if I'm wrong,

40:45.808 --> 40:48.776
but I think you know you made
a mistake choosing Thayer.

40:48.811 --> 40:50.879
- Ethan...
- Don't shut me out.

40:50.913 --> 40:52.680
Okay, and don't try to talk yourself

40:52.715 --> 40:54.883
into this just because he's
some kind of safe choice.

40:54.917 --> 40:57.886
- What Thayer and I have...
- Is not what we had.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.054
And you know it.

41:02.791 --> 41:05.627
You don't know what's going on.

41:05.661 --> 41:07.795
I promise you that it is not...

41:13.535 --> 41:15.737
You deny it all you want.

41:15.771 --> 41:17.805
You know I'm right.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.509
You and me...

41:21.543 --> 41:23.711
we're everything.

41:44.700 --> 41:47.435
(phone rings) Theresa Lopez.

41:47.469 --> 41:49.837
Hi. It's Sutton Mercer. The real one.

41:49.872 --> 41:51.706
Look, I know you're Alec's attorney,

41:51.740 --> 41:53.708
and you've protected him in the past.

41:53.742 --> 41:57.845
I have some startling
things you may want to know.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.681
Okay.

41:59.715 --> 42:00.815
Can you meet me, tonight?

42:00.849 --> 42:01.816
I can't do this over the phone.

42:01.850 --> 42:03.718
Yeah, of course.

42:03.752 --> 42:05.386
Uh... give me an hour.

42:05.421 --> 42:07.488
Meet me at the diner off of Route 1?

42:07.523 --> 42:08.690
Yeah, I'll see you there.
