WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:09.885
Steel yourself against
my steel, villain!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.643
Your reign of tears is over!

00:17.809 --> 00:20.562
- I got the onion, Dad.
- I'll get the bok choy.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.481
- Hi-yah!
- I'll get the radish.

00:24.149 --> 00:24.650
Yah!

00:24.816 --> 00:26.902
Chop it fine, son. Chop it fine!

00:29.571 --> 00:31.198
- Carrot!
- Mushrooms!

00:31.365 --> 00:32.533
- Ginger!
- Leeks!

00:32.699 --> 00:33.951
- Garlic!
- Soy sauce!

00:34.117 --> 00:35.577
- Beets!
- No beets.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.079
But I like beets.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.039
One final ingredient.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.250
Noodles!

00:45.128 --> 00:46.171
One noodle soup!

00:50.133 --> 00:51.134
So delicious!

00:53.011 --> 00:56.306
- Dad, this dream is awesome!
- It's the noodle dream.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.271
Tai Lung?
I thought you were dead...

01:03.063 --> 01:05.023
Wait! Please, don't eat my son!

01:05.190 --> 01:08.485
- Have some delicious noodle soup.
- So delicious!

01:08.652 --> 01:10.654
Don't worry, Dad.
I got it under control!

01:11.947 --> 01:14.783
No!

01:19.663 --> 01:21.206
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?

01:21.373 --> 01:23.834
- We're cooking together!
- Sorry, Dad.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.713
Evil doesn't take a holiday...
and neither do I.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.173
Goodbye, Dad.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.300
Po, don't go!
Don't go, my son!

01:31.466 --> 01:34.261
You can't leave me alone!
I need you!

01:36.346 --> 01:37.347
Po!

01:38.432 --> 01:40.142
Dad, where'd they go?
What'd they look like?

01:40.309 --> 01:42.686
Oh, I was dreaming.
It was awful!

01:42.853 --> 01:45.772
We were cooking,
but then you left me.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.275
Now, how could you
leave me?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.902
Dad, it was just a dream.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.612
I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.697
Now, come on down.
I got all the decorations out.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.157
Thank you, Po.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.409
You are such a good son.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.996
You owe me 17 yuan
for the new door.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.294
Whoa, right on top!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.671
It's the sun lantern I made
when I was a cub.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.132
You know why it was on top, Po?

02:12.299 --> 02:15.219
Because I opened the box
this summer just to look at it.

02:15.552 --> 02:20.265
I love Winter Festival so much,
sometimes I just can't wait.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.977
- Me, too. The decorations...
- The party games!

02:24.144 --> 02:27.356
The dancing. Huh, Dad? The dancing!

02:29.191 --> 02:30.400
Noodles...

02:33.237 --> 02:35.155
Good morning, Dragon Warrior.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.950
I was just
practicing my...

02:38.116 --> 02:39.284
...Empty Belly Defense.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.120
Mr. Ping, may I
borrow Po for a moment?

02:42.287 --> 02:44.540
Well, actually, we're very
busy decorating for the...

02:44.706 --> 02:47.835
I've come to talk to you about the
Winter Feast at the Jade Palace.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.962
- You will be...
- Be coming?!

02:50.128 --> 02:52.756
The Winter Feast with the Kung Fu
Masters from all the provinces?!

02:52.923 --> 02:54.716
No, Po, you will not be invited.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.051
You will be hosting.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.762
Me? Hosting?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.266
Wonderful news, is it not?

03:02.432 --> 03:06.728
As the Dragon Warrior, this is
one of your most critical duties.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.022
Wow! Thank you, Shifu.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.109
Po, this is
a big opportunity for you.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.778
Your first time
with all the Kung Fu Masters.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.197
The Winter Feast is legendary!

03:17.364 --> 03:20.284
I'll bet you got the best, biggest,
brightest sun lanterns and dancing.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.871
Po. Stop. Stop.
This is the Winter Feast.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.248
It is perfection.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.750
Always elegant.
Always formal.

03:29.334 --> 03:34.214
Awesome. Awesome. I'm all about
elegant. Fancy stuff and fine dinin'.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.885
You have some noodle in your neck fat.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.221
What I'm saying, Po,
is dancing and sun lanterns,

03:41.388 --> 03:43.265
those are common traditions.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.350
So common. I mean, dancing?
Come on!

03:46.101 --> 03:47.186
Sun lanterns?

03:47.936 --> 03:50.564
Weak. Dad! Isn't this great?

03:52.191 --> 03:53.775
Dragon Warrior!
Please, come quickly!

03:53.942 --> 03:55.527
- There are bandits at the bridge!
- What?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.112
I'm on it. See ya, Dad!

03:57.279 --> 03:58.363
Thanks again, Master Shifu!

04:01.033 --> 04:02.117
Mr. Ping.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.380
Hey, guys!

04:15.547 --> 04:16.924
You excited about
the Winter Feast?

04:17.090 --> 04:20.385
Guess what? Master Shifu just told me
I'll be joining you this year.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.389
The Feast is intense!
All the Masters at one table!

04:24.556 --> 04:25.807
One perfect feast.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.809
It's an honor to be invited.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.478
Actually, I'm not just invited.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.813
I'm hosting!

04:33.607 --> 04:35.984
- What?
- Wouldn't be my choice.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.238
- What?
- The Feast at the palace is very...

04:39.404 --> 04:40.489
...elegant.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.908
It's a very sophisticated event.

04:43.075 --> 04:46.620
Why does everyone think
I can't do sophisticated?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.958
I... have no idea.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.628
It's just that we think maybe
you could use a little help.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.421
Tigress, I got this.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.258
It's a dinner.
Eating, entertainment.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.385
How much
do you have to know?

05:03.512 --> 05:06.306
There are 18 gestures you must
memorize for the right hand.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.724
Nineteen for the left.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.768
Nineteen for the right,
19, 18 for the left.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.854
This is Feng, the palace artist.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.397
He will do your official portrait.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.440
Pleased to... What?

05:15.607 --> 05:18.318
OK, I'm gonna need a
do-over. I think I was blinking.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.821
This is where you will
seat all of the Kung Fu Masters.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.990
Oh, my dad's
gonna love this feast.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.200
You know, he's never
even been to the palace?

05:25.367 --> 05:28.203
I am sorry, Po.
There are no guests allowed.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.081
I can't bring my dad?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.750
But he's my dad. We always
spend the holiday together.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.377
I understand, Po.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.046
I remember the day
I departed my family

05:38.213 --> 05:42.217
and committed myself entirely
to the duties of kung fu.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.303
You are the Dragon Warrior now,

05:44.469 --> 05:47.598
and therefore this is your duty
above all other bonds.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.643
Now... in your quest
for perfection,

05:51.810 --> 05:54.062
these instructions must
be executed to the letter.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.815
Guard these scrolls
containing the ancient recipes.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.317
Flaked jasmine. Never ground...

06:00.569 --> 06:04.114
...elegant... traditional
greeting of the Masters...

06:04.281 --> 06:06.658
- ...magnificent Golden Ladle!
- What?

06:06.825 --> 06:10.495
Po. Hire a chef. Present them
with the Golden Ladle.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.873
Do you have any questions?

06:13.040 --> 06:16.376
- Nuh-uh!
- Po, do not let me down.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.796
Don't worry, Master Shifu,
I got everything under control...

06:22.090 --> 06:23.300
What?

06:28.931 --> 06:31.767
Master Po. We have brought you
the finest chefs in China.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.644
You'll sample their dishes
and make your choice.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.436
Yeah.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.272
The chef you select will
receive the Golden Ladle.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.358
- Let us begin.
- Alrighty!

06:39.525 --> 06:41.026
Master Po...

06:41.193 --> 06:45.531
I present Chef Wo Hop
of the Heilongjiang Province.

06:46.532 --> 06:50.619
Sir, it is a privilege for me
and the citizens of my village

06:50.786 --> 06:52.329
- to be considered for this great honor.
- Hi, Po!

06:52.496 --> 06:53.497
Hey!

06:54.790 --> 06:58.335
- What just happened?
- Well... as host of the festival,

06:58.502 --> 07:00.295
every gesture of yours
has meaning.

07:00.546 --> 07:03.882
You just gave him the ancient
Hun Shu Wave of Dismissal.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.593
The what? Is that a thing?
That doesn't even sound like a thing!

07:06.760 --> 07:09.805
He has brought great dishonor
upon himself and his village,

07:09.972 --> 07:11.765
and they will be shamed
for all of eternity.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.439
No, no! I was just waving to Monkey!

07:19.606 --> 07:21.608
Can't we just get the rabbit back?

07:21.775 --> 07:26.071
Oh, you're serious? No.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.740
I'll... I'll get the other chefs.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.410
Wow, this feast is intense. Right?

07:31.910 --> 07:35.372
And I just found out
that I can't be with my dad.

07:35.539 --> 07:39.168
Wait a minute. Of course!
You're absolutely right.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.212
I'll choose my dad! Then I'll get
to spend the holiday with him.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.591
Brilliant! You are good.
Come here, you.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.595
OK... I've gotta
get rid of these guys.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.847
Hate the food. Hate the food.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.516
Oh, this...

07:54.683 --> 07:56.810
...isn't really
what we're looking for.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.607
Nope.
No. No... No. No.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.192
This isn't really your year.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.860
No. Nope. Nuh-uh.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.987
Nah. No. Nah.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.199
Ew. Sorry.
That one really is bad.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.659
No. No. None of these will do.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.536
I'll take that. Thank you.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.831
Nice try, everyone.
See you next year!

08:19.208 --> 08:23.378
- Awful.
- Master Po? We haven't picked a chef.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.217
The Golden Ladle!

08:28.383 --> 08:29.968
- Yeah.
- I'm holding it.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.845
- Yeah.
- To be asked to prepare a meal

08:32.012 --> 08:33.722
for all the great Kung Fu Masters!

08:33.889 --> 08:35.641
What an extraordinary honor!

08:35.807 --> 08:37.392
When is it?

08:37.559 --> 08:40.062
- Tomorrow night.
- Oh, that won't work.

08:40.229 --> 08:43.065
- What? Why?
- Po, that's the holiday!

08:43.232 --> 08:46.276
- Exactly!
- Well, I cannot leave the restaurant.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.820
- Why not?
- What about our friends?

08:48.987 --> 08:53.367
What about those lonely people
who have no place else to go?

08:53.534 --> 08:55.661
We give them a place
to call home.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.248
There's always room
for one more at Mr. Ping's.

08:59.414 --> 09:03.001
OK, Dad, I appreciate that you
care for all the lonely people.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.547
- And lonely people pay extra.
- But, Dad, I need you.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.466
The Feast is tomorrow. I just fired
all the best chefs in the land.

09:09.633 --> 09:13.136
The best chefs
in the land, huh? Really?

09:13.303 --> 09:17.266
You think your fancy palace
ladle is better than mine?

09:18.225 --> 09:19.768
This is not my "A" ladle.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.854
Dad, look.
I didn't mean that.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.773
It's just I thought this was a way
for us to be together on the holiday.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.776
- I want us to be together.
- But I can't be here!

09:27.943 --> 09:29.611
I have responsibilities
to Shifu!

09:29.778 --> 09:31.405
So be there with Shifu.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.740
Don't you see my beak smiling
with happiness for you?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.910
No, no, no. Come on, Dad!

09:37.077 --> 09:38.871
Don't make me
feel guilty about this.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.165
What... What do
you expect me to do?

09:41.331 --> 09:45.210
I expect you to do
the right thing, Po.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.797
Here, son. You should
have this on the holiday.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.097
How could my dad say no?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.808
"I would rather you stay here,
do my holiday thing with me."

09:59.975 --> 10:02.060
Yeah, fine. Whatever!
Well, what about me, Dad?

10:02.227 --> 10:03.520
Now I gotta cook all alone!

10:03.687 --> 10:05.814
- Po?
- Shifu, hey!

10:05.981 --> 10:08.317
All alone?
You do not have a chef yet?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.569
No, no, of course I have a chef.
You kidding?

10:10.736 --> 10:14.156
No chef...
That would be a disaster.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.117
I gotta get a chef.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.038
- Pardon me?
- Bunny! Awesome, a real chef.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.123
Listen, I know we got off
to kind of a rocky start,

10:23.290 --> 10:26.668
what with me shaming you and your
village for all eternity and whatnot.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.420
But if you could start
dicing those carrots...

10:28.587 --> 10:30.464
I am not here to dice carrots.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.549
- I am here to fight you.
- Huh?

10:32.716 --> 10:36.845
The only way I can lift the veil of
shame is to fight the Dragon Warrior.

10:37.012 --> 10:41.683
Surely I will die,
but it will restore my honor!

10:42.267 --> 10:43.519
What are you doing?

10:43.685 --> 10:45.938
Come on! I don't wanna hurt you.
Look, Bunny,

10:46.104 --> 10:48.482
I get this whole honor thing.
But this isn't kung fu.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.361
You're biting me. Ha! Look,
Bunny, I have enough on my plate

10:52.528 --> 10:54.696
between cooking and my
dad guilting me. Get off...

10:54.863 --> 10:56.615
What is it with parents
and the holidays?

10:56.782 --> 10:58.367
Sometimes they love us too much.

10:58.534 --> 11:02.246
But, it is not my place to say.
It is my place to die.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.705
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.499
- OK.
- How dare you!

11:05.666 --> 11:07.709
- There you go.
- Let me out of here!

11:07.876 --> 11:09.586
Po, the table is not set.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.880
- Have you started cooking?
- We've all had our fittings.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.882
- Are you ready?
- I'm on it!

11:16.802 --> 11:18.887
Oh, sorry. Ow!

11:19.054 --> 11:22.391
Wha...? Tap, tap, tap.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.060
Of course he's never here
when you need him.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.231
Po? The vocalist
for the band quit.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.317
I've been waiting
for this moment my whole life.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.362
Let's just go instrumental.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.155
This is an embarrassment.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.699
Po?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.201
Ha-ha!

11:43.078 --> 11:44.913
Ow! Bunny!

11:45.080 --> 11:47.541
Sorry! Ow!

11:49.751 --> 11:51.086
Hi. We'd like
two noodle...

11:51.253 --> 11:52.504
We're not open yet!

12:04.057 --> 12:05.309
This is not right.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.607
Whoa!

12:17.779 --> 12:19.823
This is a total disaster.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.952
Now I'm gonna
disappoint everyone.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.290
My dad, the Furious Five, Shifu.

12:28.457 --> 12:32.252
And me. I'm not dead yet.

12:32.419 --> 12:36.757
What kind of Dragon Warrior am I
if I can't even pull off a dinner?

12:36.924 --> 12:39.801
I guess kung fu
can't solve everything.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.305
That's it!
Bunny, you're brilliant!

12:43.472 --> 12:45.807
Mantis! Crane! Monkey!

12:47.643 --> 12:49.269
This may be our
greatest challenge ever.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.812
- Bandits?
- Raiders?

12:50.979 --> 12:53.232
No. Place settings.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.777
Tigress! The Tahlia Leap!

12:56.944 --> 12:59.613
- On it.
- Viper! Stars of Destiny!

13:00.989 --> 13:02.282
Yeah!

13:02.449 --> 13:03.575
Mantis! Pinwheel Attack!

13:05.911 --> 13:07.162
Oh, yeah!

13:07.329 --> 13:09.331
You guys are the best.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.251
And you, Bunny... if you even want me
to think about your "death with honor,"

13:12.417 --> 13:14.837
you're gonna have to help me
in the kitchen. Let's go!

13:38.777 --> 13:42.948
Twenty-nine place settings, 40
chopsticks each. We did it! We did it!

13:43.115 --> 13:44.867
Every detail just right.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.036
- Even down to the ground jasmine.
- Ground jasmine?!

13:48.203 --> 13:50.164
It was supposed to be flaked!
I'll be right back.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.624
Hurry! The Masters are arriving!

13:53.375 --> 13:54.918
I promised Shifu it would
be perf...

14:07.723 --> 14:09.308
- Happy Feast!
- Yeah, same to you!

14:09.474 --> 14:12.269
Whoa, hey. Look out. Dragon
Warrior comin' through!

14:12.436 --> 14:14.813
OK, hurry, Po, hurry, Po.

14:29.328 --> 14:33.415
- You made it.
- Of course! I'd never miss it.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.501
- It looks so yummy!
- Eat up.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.461
Here you go!

14:39.379 --> 14:41.256
Thanks, Daddy.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.861
Beautiful. Elegant.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.113
Perfect.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.075
You've made me proud.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.620
All 29 Kung Fu
Schools and their Masters.

15:11.787 --> 15:15.791
Excellent. Excellent.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.506
Po!

15:25.217 --> 15:27.469
Dragon Warrior,
would you honor us

15:27.636 --> 15:31.515
by reciting the opening words
to the Creed of the Masters?

15:36.478 --> 15:39.731
- Po?
- I can't, Master Shifu.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.817
I thought you
might forget the words, Po,

15:41.984 --> 15:44.319
so I took the liberty of
writing them on your napkin.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.154
Let me ju...
That's not it.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.410
No, no, everyone, please.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.954
OK. Please don't...
You don't have to...

15:54.121 --> 15:56.665
OK, well, they're off.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.335
Anyway... let me
just say something.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.589
The Creed of the Masters
is amazing.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.966
It's, like,
the coolest creed ever.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.178
And... you Masters...
how cool are you guys?

16:09.344 --> 16:10.679
I don't even
have to tell you.

16:10.846 --> 16:13.015
Master Rhino? Forget about it!

16:13.182 --> 16:15.767
You're more
awesomely skilled and...

16:15.934 --> 16:18.687
...you know, wrinkly than
I'd ever dreamed you'd be.

16:18.896 --> 16:22.316
And Master Sheep?
Fluffy and incredible.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.359
- It's true.
- The Five?

16:24.526 --> 16:27.613
It's just such an honor
to be here with all you guys.

16:28.739 --> 16:29.781
My heroes.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.704
But every Feast, my dad and I
spend all day cooking together.

16:35.871 --> 16:39.208
And the whole neighborhood shows up.
And it gets really loud and crazy,

16:39.374 --> 16:42.377
and my Uncle Yang ends up laughing
so hard, noodles spurt out his nose.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.505
- I'd like to see that.
- Me, too.

16:44.671 --> 16:48.133
So... I wish I could
stay and be a good host,

16:48.300 --> 16:50.969
but I think I need
to leave and...

16:53.931 --> 16:57.559
- ...be a good son.
- What... What's going on?

16:57.726 --> 17:00.354
- What are we supposed to...?
- Po! Come back here!

17:00.729 --> 17:03.232
I used to love
cooking with my sisters.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.026
- The folk dances.
- The games. The music.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.237
Whoa, wait.
What about our traditions?

17:08.403 --> 17:10.030
Who will recite the Creed?

17:10.197 --> 17:12.449
Somebody do something!

17:23.919 --> 17:27.005
- Whoa...
- I got that, Dad.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.257
Po?

17:30.342 --> 17:31.510
You came!

17:31.677 --> 17:35.389
Oh, Po, I'm sorry
I made you feel so guilty.

17:35.556 --> 17:39.309
Nah, don't be. That's what
the holidays are all about.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.562
Now, don't we have
some cookin' to do?

18:06.628 --> 18:09.089
- It needs...
- Garlic.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.152
Table for five?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.612
Hey, Po!

18:32.988 --> 18:37.034
- You guys! Welcome!
- Happy holiday, Po.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.495
- The more, the merrier!
- Thank you, Mr. Ping.

18:39.661 --> 18:43.207
The little one pays full
price but eats like a child.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.333
Welcome!

18:46.376 --> 18:48.462
Master Rhino, come sit with me!

18:58.639 --> 19:01.517
Master Wo Hop.
I believe this belongs to you.

19:01.683 --> 19:02.935
The Golden Ladle?

19:03.852 --> 19:05.854
Thank you, Dragon Warrior.

19:06.021 --> 19:09.525
Now, I have restored my honor
and the honor of my village!

19:16.490 --> 19:18.867
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy...
it's Uncle Yang!

19:19.034 --> 19:22.371
Oh, Po, why did you ruin
something that was perfect?

19:22.538 --> 19:24.498
I don't understand.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.045
Come back here! I got ya!

19:32.047 --> 19:35.217
Then, the Crocodile
Thief pounced!

19:35.384 --> 19:37.010
Peek-a-boo!

19:37.177 --> 19:39.346
I'm gonna get you.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.640
- Oh, Po?
- I got you, Dad.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.901
This is perfect.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.575
There's always room
for one more at Mr. Ping's.

19:59.741 --> 20:04.246
Oh, no. I really don't
want to disturb anyone.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.291
You go and enjoy your party.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.750
I'm not gonna enjoy it
without you.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.879
Oh, no, I couldn't.
These are your people.

20:12.045 --> 20:16.216
- This is your family.
- You're my family, too, Shifu.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.593
Now, come on.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.890
That soup
does smell delicious.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.184
Po, wait.

20:25.350 --> 20:29.271
What goes on in your head I
really don't always understand.

20:30.355 --> 20:33.567
But what goes on in your
heart will never let us down.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.070
Thanks, Shifu. Come on.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.615
Hey, guys, look who's here!

20:39.781 --> 20:42.534
- Master Shifu's here!
- It's good to see you, Master Shifu!

20:42.701 --> 20:44.703
And it's good
to be here, Mr. Ping.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.872
Sit, sit, sit, sit!

20:50.459 --> 20:52.711
Thanks for comin', everyone!

20:52.878 --> 20:54.338
Watch out, little one...

22:07.286 --> 22:09.621
I'm hosting the Feast
Toasting the Feast

22:09.788 --> 22:12.499
I'm going to be
doing the Feast

22:12.666 --> 22:14.960
Servin' it up
Right in your cup

22:15.127 --> 22:17.921
Makin' a Feast to remember!

22:18.088 --> 22:20.465
I've never hosted
hosted a Feast before

22:20.632 --> 22:22.801
That won't stop me
from serving some boar

22:22.968 --> 22:24.678
Fried boar!

22:24.845 --> 22:26.597
On-the-side boar

22:30.017 --> 22:31.310
Yeah.
