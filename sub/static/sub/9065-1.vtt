<i>October 7, 2007.</i>

01:15.337 --> 01:17.271
<i>Four days till we deploy.</i>

01:18.573 --> 01:21.565
<i>Grace knows I would do anything
to get back to her.</i>

01:22.277 --> 01:23.471
<i>Anything.</i>

01:26.114 --> 01:28.139
<i>Today I wrote her a letter.</i>

01:39.794 --> 01:43.423
Good afternoon, sir. I have the briefing
papers from the colonel's office.

01:43.565 --> 01:45.294
Put them on the desk.

01:49.771 --> 01:51.033
Thank you, Corporal.

01:57.646 --> 01:59.443
Major. Hey.

02:00.882 --> 02:02.782
Hope you don't have to deliver it.

02:04.452 --> 02:05.476
Copy that.

02:05.887 --> 02:07.616
- Be safe out there, Sam.
- Thanks, sir.

02:07.756 --> 02:09.985
- See you when you get back.
- All right.

02:18.099 --> 02:19.396
How's this?

02:19.534 --> 02:20.592
Warm.

02:24.539 --> 02:25.870
- Hello.
- Dad!

02:26.007 --> 02:28.066
Hey! Hey, baby.

02:28.210 --> 02:29.370
- Hi, Daddy.
- How you doing?

02:29.511 --> 02:31.172
- How was school?
- Great.

02:32.247 --> 02:35.375
They gave me Noodles the dog.
She's in my room.

02:37.018 --> 02:38.315
Izzie?

02:39.888 --> 02:41.185
Hey.

02:42.023 --> 02:44.218
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.894
What's wrong, honey?

02:47.028 --> 02:48.757
You're leaving again.

02:49.698 --> 02:51.359
Come give your daddy a hug.

02:52.067 --> 02:52.999
No.

02:54.069 --> 02:55.900
Come on. Give me a kiss, honey.

02:56.037 --> 02:57.197
Just go.

02:57.772 --> 03:00.104
- Two kisses?
- No.

03:01.076 --> 03:02.475
Three kisses?

03:03.144 --> 03:05.009
I wanna read my book.

03:05.146 --> 03:07.080
You wanna read your book?

03:08.717 --> 03:09.945
Oh, yeah?

03:11.987 --> 03:16.924
I see a smile coming. There it is! There it is!
Now, you're getting 100 kisses!

03:17.092 --> 03:20.493
- Behind you! Right behind you!
- What? What? What? Who? Who?

03:21.763 --> 03:25.665
Wait a second! Two against one.
That is no fair!

03:25.834 --> 03:27.324
Daddy, put me down!

03:27.469 --> 03:28.401
Girls.

03:29.304 --> 03:32.432
- Come on. Daddy's gotta go.
- Okay.

03:32.574 --> 03:36.010
Please stay. Please let him stay.

03:36.144 --> 03:39.705
- Yeah. Can't you stay?
- It's my brother.

03:39.848 --> 03:41.679
He doesn't deserve you.

03:43.285 --> 03:45.412
Go rob another bank, Tommy!

03:45.887 --> 03:48.185
Bring that money back to me, brother!

03:57.332 --> 03:58.765
See you later.

04:23.024 --> 04:25.083
What happened to my little brother?

04:36.304 --> 04:37.566
No fucking way.

05:00.161 --> 05:02.891
You ever think of
apologizing to that woman?

05:05.600 --> 05:06.862
It's green.

05:07.702 --> 05:08.896
I got it.

05:21.249 --> 05:23.240
So, what are you gonna do?

05:23.385 --> 05:28.687
I don't know. I'm just gonna
cash this check, and then who knows.

05:29.224 --> 05:30.987
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah, all right. All right.

05:31.159 --> 05:33.719
- Don't rob the place.
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

05:48.643 --> 05:50.543
No hot water in this place?

05:52.447 --> 05:54.347
Fucking hot water is missing.

06:02.257 --> 06:03.349
I'm sorry.

06:03.525 --> 06:05.652
How do you stand this kitchen?

06:06.227 --> 06:08.661
He didn't expect to be deploying again
so soon.

06:08.797 --> 06:10.526
Yeah. Well, are you ripping your hair out?

06:10.665 --> 06:12.963
What are you gonna do?
They call, you answer.

06:13.101 --> 06:14.693
- Don't tell her. Oh, no.
- Yes!

06:14.836 --> 06:16.736
- I won.
- She got you, Granddad.

06:16.871 --> 06:18.771
You're raising a real hustler here, Grace.

06:18.907 --> 06:20.238
I know.

06:25.313 --> 06:26.940
My birthday's this spring.

06:27.081 --> 06:29.515
It is, isn't it?
What is it, March 10th, something like that?

06:34.189 --> 06:35.747
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:35.924 --> 06:38.449
- Are you Isabelle?
- No, I'm Maggie.

06:38.626 --> 06:40.116
Isabelle's big.

06:41.362 --> 06:42.886
I'm Tommy.

06:43.064 --> 06:44.554
Mom doesn't like you.

06:44.732 --> 06:45.824
Maggie!

06:45.967 --> 06:48.333
What? That's what you said to Dad.

06:49.571 --> 06:51.402
These are for your mom.

06:52.941 --> 06:54.431
Mom, they're for you.

06:54.576 --> 06:55.838
Thank you.

06:56.611 --> 06:57.771
Come in.

07:00.181 --> 07:02.012
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

07:02.150 --> 07:03.674
Come here.

07:04.652 --> 07:05.676
Hi.

07:06.054 --> 07:07.453
You made it.

07:08.790 --> 07:09.779
Yeah.

07:13.361 --> 07:14.623
- Son.
- Sir.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.494
- What? Hi.
- Hi.

07:20.635 --> 07:23.502
Bless us, O Lord, in these thy gifts
which we are about to receive

07:23.638 --> 07:25.572
from thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

07:25.707 --> 07:26.935
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:27.075 --> 07:31.444
And this is a very special meal for us
because we are welcoming one son home,

07:31.579 --> 07:34.446
and we're sending another one off.

07:34.582 --> 07:38.848
And we ask you, Lord, to keep him safe
and bring him back really soon. Right?

07:38.987 --> 07:39.976
- Yeah.
- Amen.

07:40.121 --> 07:41.452
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:42.123 --> 07:43.613
Here. You can do it.

07:43.791 --> 07:45.554
- You wanna try?
- Thank you, Mom.

07:45.727 --> 07:48.161
- Here, let me.
- Thanks, Mama.

07:49.964 --> 07:51.226
Carrots are delicious.

07:58.706 --> 08:01.766
- Why aren't you eating your peas?
- I hate peas.

08:03.411 --> 08:04.673
I do, too.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.705
Honey, eat your peas.

08:07.849 --> 08:08.781
Okay, Dad.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.248
I like peas.

08:11.085 --> 08:12.518
So do I.

08:12.654 --> 08:14.884
- When are you leaving?
- Tuesday.

08:18.192 --> 08:20.217
You love it over there, huh?

08:21.829 --> 08:23.194
It's my job.

08:23.331 --> 08:25.458
They only shoot the bad guys.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.796
Who are the bad guys?

08:30.038 --> 08:31.505
The ones with the beards.

08:35.376 --> 08:37.241
Your brother's a hero.

08:37.779 --> 08:41.270
He's serving his country,
and don't you ever forget that.

08:43.985 --> 08:46.317
Will you be here for my birthday?

08:47.155 --> 08:49.089
You know I will, sweetie.

08:50.725 --> 08:52.488
Sarah Miller's dad wasn't there
for her birthday.

08:52.894 --> 08:55.226
- Isabelle.
- It's true.

08:55.363 --> 08:57.923
She had to bring him a cake in prison.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.532
It's not just military families.

09:01.669 --> 09:04.263
There's a lot of folks under pressure
these days.

09:05.239 --> 09:07.969
They got problems in all walks of life.

09:09.444 --> 09:12.311
Every family's got
their own set of problems.

09:14.916 --> 09:16.315
They sure do.

09:20.188 --> 09:22.315
What is that supposed to mean?

09:26.327 --> 09:28.852
Every family has their own set of problems.

09:29.030 --> 09:31.260
You sound like a damn parrot.

09:31.399 --> 09:32.661
Like a what?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.564
Why don't you try mimicking your brother
for a change?

09:35.703 --> 09:36.931
Dad.

09:38.573 --> 09:41.098
This food is great, Elsie. Thank you.

09:42.977 --> 09:44.535
Compared to what?

09:49.617 --> 09:50.982
Other food.

09:51.119 --> 09:52.643
Prison food?

09:52.787 --> 09:53.879
Tommy!

10:00.461 --> 10:01.723
Excuse me.

10:06.934 --> 10:08.060
It's okay, honey.

10:08.202 --> 10:10.295
- No. No.
- It's his first night out.

10:10.438 --> 10:14.704
He comes waltzing in here
with no regard for anybody else.

10:14.842 --> 10:16.901
Doesn't even bother to apologize...

10:32.226 --> 10:33.887
Stay out of trouble.

10:36.564 --> 10:37.826
All right.

10:42.437 --> 10:44.803
You be safe over there. All right?

10:57.385 --> 10:59.080
This thing's not coming off.

11:00.021 --> 11:02.615
- Try more soap.
- Yeah.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.223
Almost got it.

11:08.529 --> 11:09.996
There we go.

11:12.266 --> 11:14.894
- Don't lose that.
- I'll do my best.

11:15.036 --> 11:16.230
Okay.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.071
- Take a lot of pictures when I'm gone.
- I always do.

11:26.781 --> 11:28.078
I love you.

11:28.916 --> 11:30.440
I love you, too.

12:00.047 --> 12:01.105
Sam?

12:03.351 --> 12:04.909
Take me with you.

12:06.621 --> 12:07.645
Sure.

12:11.692 --> 12:14.490
How about I go and you stay with the kids?

12:17.131 --> 12:18.257
Okay.

12:22.403 --> 12:23.836
Don't go.

12:30.178 --> 12:31.873
<i>October 12, 2007.</i>

12:32.780 --> 12:35.180
<i>Back in Afghanistan with my men.</i>

12:38.486 --> 12:41.853
<i>Weird. It almost feels like home.</i>

13:19.160 --> 13:21.390
Hi, Cassie. Joe Jr. is so big.

13:44.652 --> 13:46.119
What's the distance to the LZ?

13:46.254 --> 13:49.280
We're three minutes out.
Clear to detach to the LZ.

13:49.457 --> 13:50.481
Roger that.

13:57.498 --> 13:59.932
<i>Clear to engage. Weapons hot.</i>

14:00.234 --> 14:03.431
<i>Target took cover in the valley.</i>

14:03.571 --> 14:04.765
Little bastards...

14:42.310 --> 14:43.800
Who is it?

14:43.945 --> 14:47.005
It's Captain Sanderson and Chaplain Davis.

14:50.551 --> 14:51.483
Hi.

14:53.955 --> 14:56.150
- Hi. Is your mother home?
- Yeah.

14:58.326 --> 14:59.725
Where is she?

15:00.361 --> 15:01.760
In the bath.

15:04.332 --> 15:06.459
Would you call her for us, please?

15:10.905 --> 15:12.338
What's wrong?

15:15.076 --> 15:16.270
Izzie.

15:17.211 --> 15:19.076
- Okay.
- Bye.

15:33.694 --> 15:35.161
Come in.

16:09.764 --> 16:13.325
<i>You've reached Captain Sam Cahill.
Please leave a message.</i>

16:20.541 --> 16:24.102
<i>You've reached Captain Sam Cahill.
Please leave a message.</i>

16:40.161 --> 16:41.594
Grace.

16:43.431 --> 16:45.865
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

16:48.002 --> 16:49.264
I was just dropping off the car.

16:49.403 --> 16:52.804
Sam told me I could borrow it
whenever I wanted, so...

16:54.041 --> 16:58.137
The taillight's a little busted.
Some asshole...

17:03.617 --> 17:05.311
Look, you know...

17:07.054 --> 17:08.453
Just say it, you know what I mean?
All right.

17:08.589 --> 17:11.422
He told me I could borrow the car
whenever I wanted, Grace.

17:11.592 --> 17:13.025
You look at me with this pissed-off look.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.593
Sam's dead.

17:17.998 --> 17:19.396
They crashed.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.760
- What are you talking about?
- He's dead, Tommy.

17:24.371 --> 17:26.202
Come in, come in.

17:32.613 --> 17:34.774
I don't wanna fucking come in.

17:36.684 --> 17:38.948
I just came here to drop off...

17:39.787 --> 17:43.052
- Why didn't you call me?
- I've been trying to call you all night.

17:43.224 --> 17:47.126
- Why didn't anybody call me?
- We've all been trying, Tommy.

17:48.829 --> 17:50.057
Okay.

17:53.767 --> 17:53.994
- Why'd you let him go over there, Grace?
- Tommy.

17:59.006 --> 18:01.065
For what now, huh?

18:18.325 --> 18:19.952
Tommy, come inside.

18:21.962 --> 18:24.396
I just had to sit down for a second.

18:32.106 --> 18:34.939
He's with your mama now. They're together.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.201
Drink?

19:11.078 --> 19:12.067
No.

19:43.777 --> 19:45.802
Girls? You ready?

19:46.914 --> 19:49.439
Yeah, in about just one minute.

19:51.218 --> 19:54.415
- Why'd you take your dress off?
- I hate it.

19:55.823 --> 19:58.792
We're going to put it on, okay?
We have to go.

19:59.193 --> 20:00.683
I don't want to.

20:02.096 --> 20:05.065
I don't want to wear mine either. It's itchy.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.511
Okay, come here. Okay.

20:22.383 --> 20:23.816
Come here.

20:28.889 --> 20:31.983
- Okay.
- Is Dad really dead like your mom and dad?

21:21.742 --> 21:23.767
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate it.

21:32.853 --> 21:35.447
- I'm so sorry, dear.
- Thanks for coming.

21:36.490 --> 21:38.924
Sir, your son's the best damn Marine
I ever commanded.

21:39.093 --> 21:40.526
I appreciate it.

21:43.931 --> 21:45.398
- Come on, girls.
- Coming, Grandpa.

21:45.566 --> 21:47.431
- Get in the car.
- Come on, Maggie.

21:47.568 --> 21:50.093
- Elsie, I'm sorry for your loss.
- I'll watch them.

21:50.237 --> 21:51.329
Okay.

21:51.472 --> 21:56.409
Grace, Sam wrote this for you before he left.
He never wanted me to have to deliver it.

22:02.616 --> 22:04.584
I don't believe it, John.

22:05.452 --> 22:07.010
I can't feel it.

22:08.722 --> 22:10.952
Shouldn't I be able to feel it?

22:11.925 --> 22:15.827
It's hard to accept.
He was a good friend, a good Marine.

22:17.631 --> 22:20.498
- Why don't you let me drive?
- What are you talking about?

22:20.634 --> 22:23.000
- Come on, girls.
- Coming.

22:23.871 --> 22:26.135
Hey, why don't you give me the keys, Dad?

22:26.273 --> 22:27.797
What makes you so responsible
all of a sudden?

22:30.144 --> 22:31.702
Let Tommy drive.

22:31.845 --> 22:34.177
"Let Tommy drive." Look, I'll tell you what.

22:34.314 --> 22:36.544
Why don't you get a job
and earn some money,

22:36.683 --> 22:37.809
buy yourself a car,

22:37.951 --> 22:40.920
and then you can drive it
wherever the hell you want.

22:41.054 --> 22:42.544
Give me the keys.

22:45.125 --> 22:48.754
Did you hear those Marines in there today
talking about your brother?

22:48.929 --> 22:50.123
Did you?

22:51.165 --> 22:55.534
Who is gonna stand up and testify for you
once you're dead?

22:56.670 --> 23:00.401
Yeah, it's my fault Sam's dead. Right?
That's what you think.

23:01.909 --> 23:04.434
It's got nothing to do with you. Right?

23:05.379 --> 23:08.177
- What are you saying to me?
- Hank.

23:11.785 --> 23:12.717
Forget it.

23:13.787 --> 23:15.584
You never had any guts.

23:15.722 --> 23:17.314
And you did.

23:17.958 --> 23:19.823
That's why you screamed at Mom
every fucking night.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.554
That's why you drove us drunk, huh?
"Hang in there, Marines."

23:22.729 --> 23:26.062
- Don't. Come on.
- Why you put all that shit in his head.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.327
- You could never fill his shoes.
- I know that.

23:28.469 --> 23:30.994
- Never could make me proud.
- For Lord's sake.

23:31.138 --> 23:32.765
That is a sin.

23:32.906 --> 23:36.342
- Stop it. Give me the keys.
- Here you go. I'm walking.

25:08.168 --> 25:09.897
This is a nightmare.

25:11.371 --> 25:12.895
What's going on?

25:13.473 --> 25:15.703
What are they gonna do with us?

25:18.011 --> 25:19.410
That yours?

25:20.347 --> 25:21.371
Yeah.

25:22.082 --> 25:23.549
That your wife?

25:24.284 --> 25:25.683
Cassie, yeah.

25:27.387 --> 25:28.820
No, she's not.

25:30.190 --> 25:31.953
You don't have a wife.

25:32.392 --> 25:34.189
You don't have a family.

25:35.295 --> 25:37.456
I'm the only person you know.

25:37.998 --> 25:42.765
It's Private Willis and Captain Cahill.
You know nothing else.

25:43.937 --> 25:45.131
Yes, sir.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.851
- Hello?
- Grace.

26:06.026 --> 26:06.958
<i>Tommy?</i>

26:08.028 --> 26:11.691
- Hi. I know it's like 1:00 in the morning.
- Yeah. It's 3:00.

26:12.299 --> 26:13.994
It's 3:00 in the morning.

26:14.134 --> 26:15.624
Okay. I had...

26:16.737 --> 26:19.171
I had a couple of drinks and, apparently,

26:19.306 --> 26:22.798
they're the most expensive drinks
in the world. And...

26:24.244 --> 26:26.269
Now I owe, like, $47.

26:28.382 --> 26:30.145
I was gonna just walk out, but then

26:30.283 --> 26:33.377
this guy says that
he was gonna nick me on a disorderly.

26:34.354 --> 26:36.584
<i>And then I'd lose my parole, so...</i>

26:39.026 --> 26:40.288
Which bar?

26:51.772 --> 26:54.240
Your nose is like the lunar eclipse.

26:55.509 --> 26:57.977
- Come on, let me touch it. Let me just...
- Get your hands off me, Tommy.

26:58.111 --> 27:01.205
- Let me just touch it for a sec.
- Tommy, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of you.

27:01.348 --> 27:02.474
Don't get so upset with me.

27:02.616 --> 27:04.311
- All right. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

27:04.451 --> 27:06.078
See. Nothing to it. Right?

27:06.219 --> 27:08.278
- Big deal.
- That thing's huge, man.

27:08.422 --> 27:10.014
- Hi.
- Great.

27:10.190 --> 27:13.091
- How much does he owe you?
- $47 and two broken glasses.

27:13.226 --> 27:15.194
- Well, how about we say...
- Ready?

27:15.362 --> 27:17.592
- Come on, Cyrano.
- Get your hands off the bar.

27:17.731 --> 27:21.189
- Don't try to ignore it. That thing's huge.
- How about we say $50. Okay?

27:21.334 --> 27:22.824
- I don't care about the money...
- That thing's huge.

27:22.969 --> 27:24.903
...just get him out of here.
I'm gonna call the cops. I'm done.

27:25.038 --> 27:28.872
Tommy, I have two little girls sleeping
in a parking lot at 3:00 in the morning.

27:29.009 --> 27:30.840
You think you're funny?

27:34.414 --> 27:35.642
Go home.

27:50.263 --> 27:51.628
Oh, God.

27:55.235 --> 27:57.601
- My head's spinning.
- Be careful.

27:57.738 --> 28:01.265
- I don't think I should be carrying a child.
- Just put her in her bed, okay?

28:01.408 --> 28:02.773
Oh, my God.

28:10.484 --> 28:12.349
- Uncle Tommy.
- Oh, my God.

28:12.486 --> 28:14.386
Uncle Tommy, wake up.

28:17.157 --> 28:18.920
Can you stop that?

28:19.092 --> 28:22.789
I'm making pancakes for Mom.
I can't stop. My sister said.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.398
Stop it.

28:29.269 --> 28:30.395
No.

28:41.982 --> 28:43.973
What are you doing here?

28:44.117 --> 28:46.950
You want me to whisk in your face, too?

28:47.087 --> 28:50.545
This is not your house,
and you're not the boss of me.

28:57.197 --> 28:58.357
Come on.

29:04.171 --> 29:06.833
We're making pancakes for Mom,
so she won't be sad.

29:06.973 --> 29:09.908
- Our dad's dead.
- He knows. He's his brother.

29:10.043 --> 29:11.442
I know that.

29:11.578 --> 29:14.479
No drinking out of the carton! It's gross!

29:16.216 --> 29:18.013
Shut up. You're gross.

29:18.785 --> 29:20.776
- No!
- You want a pancake?

29:20.921 --> 29:22.946
No, I don't like pancakes.

29:23.623 --> 29:27.286
- Our pancakes are the best.
- Eat your own crap, all right?

29:27.994 --> 29:30.224
Mom! You're supposed to be upstairs.

29:30.363 --> 29:32.456
- What are you doing awake?
- It's a surprise!

29:32.599 --> 29:35.796
I am surprised. Thank you.

29:35.936 --> 29:39.372
The nicest little girls in the world.

29:42.209 --> 29:43.233
Who's that?

29:45.378 --> 29:47.039
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

29:47.814 --> 29:49.247
- Hey, babies.
- Hi!

29:49.382 --> 29:52.078
- What have you got in your hair?
- Pancake batter.

29:52.219 --> 29:54.414
- Pancake batter.
- Hi, sweetie.

29:55.655 --> 29:58.488
- Hey, let's go watch TV.
- Come on, girls.

29:59.226 --> 30:01.387
- I'll get the syrup.
- What a mess.

30:01.561 --> 30:04.826
- Bye, Tommy.
- We'll clean this up later.

30:18.678 --> 30:20.009
Morning.

30:23.316 --> 30:24.908
Pancakes, huh?

30:26.786 --> 30:30.153
Yeah, actually there's one on the floor
if you want it.

30:38.798 --> 30:42.632
- What are they doing in here?
- They were making pancakes.

30:49.342 --> 30:50.274
Look...

30:52.178 --> 30:55.272
- I was a little stupid the other day.
- Yeah, hey.

30:56.917 --> 31:01.047
- I was okay to drive, though.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

31:20.140 --> 31:22.700
I know Sam was always smarter than me.

31:27.514 --> 31:31.848
Well, I don't know about smarter.
He was a damn good athlete.

31:35.121 --> 31:37.715
Remember that game against Easton?

31:37.891 --> 31:39.916
Cool as ice.

31:46.633 --> 31:49.727
You had some talent, too, you know.
I mean...

31:51.671 --> 31:53.468
You just quit all the time.

31:53.606 --> 31:56.734
Now, that was the difference
between you and him.

31:57.510 --> 31:59.410
Sam had no quit in him.

32:23.636 --> 32:26.469
I'd cut my throat to bring him back, Dad.

32:33.847 --> 32:35.576
God damn it.

32:35.715 --> 32:40.345
I don't know how she lives
with this kitchen the way it is.

32:51.331 --> 32:53.891
Private, come here. Fucking help me.

32:54.034 --> 32:55.763
I can't see anything.

32:58.138 --> 32:59.628
They're looking for us.

33:01.975 --> 33:03.306
All right.

33:22.295 --> 33:24.991
- Should we try again?
- Not right now.

33:46.286 --> 33:49.255
Come on, man. Just put it where you got it.

33:49.389 --> 33:51.016
Grace. Hey.

33:52.625 --> 33:55.025
You remember, A.J., Owen.

33:59.466 --> 34:02.333
Sweeney... I don't remember
your first name.

34:02.469 --> 34:03.834
There's a reason for that.

34:03.970 --> 34:06.165
- It's nice to meet you, Grace.
- You, too.

34:07.107 --> 34:08.630
What's going on?

34:11.710 --> 34:13.804
We're just fixing up the kitchen for you.

34:15.415 --> 34:16.541
Tommy.

34:20.786 --> 34:22.414
Were you ever going to run this by me?

34:22.554 --> 34:25.023
- Can you believe it? She's gorgeous.
- It's my house.

34:25.158 --> 34:26.625
- Somebody's all growed up.
- It's not funny.

34:26.793 --> 34:29.956
What the hell is wrong with you guys?
She's been...

34:30.096 --> 34:32.121
You have to run this by me.

34:36.803 --> 34:38.031
I was...

34:42.742 --> 34:46.234
- Can I get you guys coffee, something?
- No, thanks.

34:47.413 --> 34:50.576
- Maybe a beer.
- I would like a beer, too.

34:51.351 --> 34:53.080
Don't tell them anything.

34:53.219 --> 34:55.119
Don't you tell them anything, Private.

34:56.089 --> 34:58.080
They're not asking me anything.

34:59.159 --> 35:00.592
They're just starving us.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.352
Stay calm, Private.

35:03.763 --> 35:07.199
- Be present.
- I am fucking present.

35:07.367 --> 35:11.201
I'm fucking present. I've been present
in this shithole for two fucking months.

35:11.337 --> 35:14.773
What the fuck did you save me for?
Why did you come after me?

35:16.042 --> 35:19.205
I should've drowned in that lake.
We'd both be better off dead.

35:21.948 --> 35:23.438
What day is it?

35:35.762 --> 35:37.024
Saturday.

35:39.432 --> 35:40.990
What time is it?

35:48.975 --> 35:50.237
About noon.

36:21.241 --> 36:23.004
You remember what I told you.

36:23.176 --> 36:27.374
No information. You give them nothing.
You give them nothing, Private.

36:27.513 --> 36:28.502
Yeah.

36:37.857 --> 36:40.849
- Where are they taking us?
- Don't speak. Don't speak!

36:46.165 --> 36:49.225
- Are they gonna cut our heads off?
- Not another fucking word!

37:29.842 --> 37:31.036
Welcome.

37:43.022 --> 37:45.252
I used the satellite phone to call my wife.

37:46.526 --> 37:47.652
She's pregnant.

37:48.695 --> 37:51.721
I jeopardized your location
and your mission.

37:53.933 --> 37:54.399
We have the same blood.

37:56.736 --> 37:58.727
Syed is my nephew.

38:22.795 --> 38:24.092
Fuck them.

38:33.439 --> 38:34.736
This is our country.

38:36.709 --> 38:38.540
You should not be here.

38:42.815 --> 38:44.806
Tell this message to America.

38:45.985 --> 38:46.917
You say it,

38:49.288 --> 38:51.188
or I'll force you to say it.

39:39.839 --> 39:41.500
The girls are back.

39:41.941 --> 39:44.068
It's a good thing downstairs.

39:49.982 --> 39:51.813
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:53.519 --> 39:54.781
Thanks, Elsie.

39:56.022 --> 39:56.954
Okay.

40:03.329 --> 40:07.060
- Who is painting the kitchen?
- I am.

40:09.902 --> 40:10.869
Get that spot right there.

40:11.003 --> 40:13.801
You know, your dad
was a great football player in high school.

40:13.940 --> 40:15.305
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:16.075 --> 40:19.044
He was small,
but he was a great quarterback.

40:20.112 --> 40:24.446
Me and A.J. and Owen used to go
to the games just to watch him play.

40:26.519 --> 40:27.850
Did you ever have a chance
to see him play?

40:27.954 --> 40:28.921
No.

40:29.055 --> 40:31.615
- Izzie, you're so tall.
- Thanks.

40:35.194 --> 40:37.992
- Good job, Mag.
- Thanks, Mom.

40:45.137 --> 40:47.002
Do they need to
do their homework or something?

40:47.139 --> 40:49.403
No. She's having fun.

40:51.444 --> 40:52.638
Get these real good.

40:54.046 --> 40:55.104
Shit the bed!

40:57.850 --> 41:00.080
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

41:04.023 --> 41:05.786
These are brand new pants.

41:06.559 --> 41:08.186
- Hey, man...
- I'm sorry.

41:09.028 --> 41:10.393
Chill out, man. She said she was sorry.

41:10.530 --> 41:13.363
It's okay, Maggie.
I think I have something for you, okay?

41:13.499 --> 41:14.591
- Just wait here.
- Do you have a bathroom...

41:14.734 --> 41:17.396
No. Please don't bring the paint in, okay?

41:17.537 --> 41:20.506
- It's not that bad, man.
- Take it easy, man.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.165
There's almost nothing on you, man.
You look fine.

41:23.309 --> 41:26.836
That will come out.
I mean, the real major cleanup is the floor.

41:26.979 --> 41:28.071
You're such a dick.

41:28.214 --> 41:30.910
- Looks like it just grazed you.
- It doesn't look that bad.

41:34.887 --> 41:35.785
You're right.

41:36.923 --> 41:38.151
Let's hug it out.

41:38.791 --> 41:40.053
- Hugs?
- What's he talking about?

41:40.226 --> 41:41.659
- Hugs.
- What?

41:43.362 --> 41:46.354
Stay away from the kid.
Stay away from the kid.

41:46.532 --> 41:48.193
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

42:24.637 --> 42:26.571
You have a lovely body, Owen.

42:30.009 --> 42:30.998
Fuck me.

42:32.712 --> 42:34.236
Do you work out?

42:37.883 --> 42:39.316
Can I ask you
where you got your underwear?

42:39.452 --> 42:41.283
Because they fit. They fit perfectly like...

42:41.887 --> 42:43.821
You guys are so fucking funny.

42:43.990 --> 42:45.958
I'm asking you a serious question, that's all.

42:46.158 --> 42:47.489
These should all fit you.

42:47.627 --> 42:50.653
All I need is a T-shirt and some pants.

42:50.830 --> 42:52.161
Take it all.

42:52.798 --> 42:54.629
I don't need all this.

43:00.773 --> 43:03.298
She didn't have to give me all this.

43:05.144 --> 43:06.736
Just take it all, man.

43:08.981 --> 43:11.779
- I don't have to bring it back?
- Jesus. Are you listening? Take the clothes.

43:11.917 --> 43:14.511
- I was just fucking asking.
- Take them.

43:43.416 --> 43:45.748
Do you want to help your friend?

43:49.655 --> 43:51.213
Now it's his turn.

43:55.961 --> 43:58.293
- Stay strong, Private.
- Yes, sir.

44:02.868 --> 44:03.960
Fuck!

44:06.772 --> 44:08.637
Don't give them anything!

44:09.375 --> 44:10.535
Private!

44:11.911 --> 44:13.845
Your life depends on it!

44:13.979 --> 44:14.911
Please.

44:19.485 --> 44:23.421
Fuck! Motherfuckers!
I will fucking kill you!

44:25.024 --> 44:26.457
Christ!

44:27.526 --> 44:31.485
<i>My name is Private Joe Willis.
I'm with the United States Marine Corps.</i>

44:31.664 --> 44:34.963
I was told I was coming here
to fight for my country.

44:36.268 --> 44:40.170
But now I realize that Afghanistan
belongs to its people.

44:41.207 --> 44:43.573
<i>And we have no business being here.</i>

44:45.111 --> 44:46.840
<i>I love you, Cassie.</i>

44:48.748 --> 44:51.114
<i>Joe Jr., your daddy always loves you.</i>

44:56.789 --> 44:58.620
You have two daughters.

45:02.361 --> 45:04.329
Okay. Dad, get down.

45:04.497 --> 45:05.429
- How's this?
- Perfect.

45:05.598 --> 45:08.226
- Great. Great.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

45:40.332 --> 45:42.493
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

45:43.435 --> 45:44.527
Happy birthday!

45:45.838 --> 45:47.829
- You like the kitchen?
- I love it.

45:47.973 --> 45:49.497
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

45:49.642 --> 45:50.574
You're welcome.

45:51.076 --> 45:52.771
Mom, this is from Deedee.

45:52.912 --> 45:54.846
- Thank you, Deedee.
- You're welcome.

45:55.281 --> 45:57.647
- Can I help you open it?
- Yes, please.

45:58.918 --> 46:00.146
- She looking now?
- No, she's opening the presents.

46:00.286 --> 46:01.753
Good job on the kitchen.

46:02.388 --> 46:03.412
What did he just say to me?

46:03.556 --> 46:05.581
He said you did a good job on the kitchen.

46:06.025 --> 46:06.957
Okay. Go, go.

46:27.746 --> 46:30.010
Blow out the candles. Come on, come on.

46:31.817 --> 46:32.943
Do it.

46:39.391 --> 46:40.688
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

46:40.860 --> 46:43.420
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- Thank you.

46:48.667 --> 46:50.567
Maggie? Maggie.

46:51.136 --> 46:52.660
- No!
- Maggie, slow down.

46:52.805 --> 46:54.568
Maggie, be careful.

46:58.711 --> 46:59.735
What are you doing?

46:59.879 --> 47:01.938
I want to get to the ice before my mama.

47:02.081 --> 47:04.481
Well, you better wait for her,
don't you think?

47:05.184 --> 47:06.947
Everybody loves Maggie.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.447
- Why do you say that?
- Because she's lovable.

47:18.964 --> 47:20.693
You know, your dad saved me

47:20.833 --> 47:23.301
in that water, right there,
when we were both kids.

47:25.771 --> 47:27.500
You know, you're like your dad.

47:28.207 --> 47:29.265
Am I?

47:33.445 --> 47:35.072
Am I like my mom?

47:37.116 --> 47:38.913
A spitting image, yeah.

47:40.586 --> 47:44.215
Except you're yourself, Isabelle.
And everybody loves you.

47:44.957 --> 47:46.151
Come on.

48:12.084 --> 48:13.312
I did it!

49:19.084 --> 49:21.484
I talked to her for over an hour.

49:23.288 --> 49:27.247
She said to me that she hadn't slept right
in over three years.

49:28.394 --> 49:32.592
She kept having these nightmares
that I would come back and shoot her.

49:36.468 --> 49:37.799
I don't know.

49:40.439 --> 49:43.465
I told her it was all right,
that I wasn't gonna hurt her.

49:45.110 --> 49:47.010
She just started to cry.

49:50.549 --> 49:53.518
Right there in the bank,
she just started to cry.

49:58.223 --> 49:59.918
And she thanked me.

50:04.563 --> 50:06.758
She said that she felt like...

50:08.300 --> 50:09.824
What did she say?

50:12.104 --> 50:14.072
Like she could breathe again.

50:16.175 --> 50:19.338
And then she asked
if I wanted to open up a bank account.

50:19.478 --> 50:20.410
No.

50:21.013 --> 50:22.241
I swear to God.

50:22.381 --> 50:24.440
- What did you do?
- I opened an account.

50:29.321 --> 50:30.879
I'm proud of you.

50:32.991 --> 50:35.425
I can't wait to start bouncing checks.

50:49.174 --> 50:53.907
When I was like 17 or 18,

51:00.919 --> 51:05.413
I used to listen to this song,
like, over and over again.

51:05.591 --> 51:06.785
Me, too.

51:09.428 --> 51:10.725
Really?

51:10.863 --> 51:12.797
Why is that so surprising?

51:15.300 --> 51:17.200
I don't know. I just...

51:20.305 --> 51:22.773
I took you more for, like, an 'NSync fan.

51:22.941 --> 51:24.067
Fuck you.

51:24.710 --> 51:26.143
Give me that.

51:26.778 --> 51:28.473
- Really?
- Really.

51:42.127 --> 51:44.152
You think I'm such a square.

51:44.997 --> 51:47.329
I'm starting to reassess, Snoop Dogg.

51:53.972 --> 51:56.497
Just because I was a cheerleader,
it doesn't...

51:58.310 --> 52:00.801
Yeah, and you dated a football player.

52:00.946 --> 52:02.607
I am such a clichÃ©.

52:09.588 --> 52:11.852
You were kind of a pain in the ass.
You got to admit that.

52:12.024 --> 52:13.651
No, I wasn't.

52:14.526 --> 52:17.984
Guys always say that girls are stuck up
if they won't talk to them.

52:18.630 --> 52:20.461
I just didn't like you.

52:20.599 --> 52:23.159
You were always drunk and fighting...

53:02.341 --> 53:04.502
I have to get some air.

54:54.086 --> 54:55.246
Captain!

54:57.255 --> 54:58.620
Captain!

55:40.599 --> 55:41.759
Take it.

56:02.454 --> 56:03.819
What do we do?

56:06.024 --> 56:08.015
He has no value for us.

56:10.429 --> 56:12.590
Just a weight on our shoulder.

56:15.700 --> 56:17.668
Waste of food and water.

56:19.905 --> 56:21.031
Kill him.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.222
Pick it up.

56:45.764 --> 56:47.026
You have family?

56:49.901 --> 56:51.391
Do you want to see them again?

56:53.038 --> 56:54.903
Pick up the pipe!

57:00.879 --> 57:02.904
- Captain...
- It's you or him.

57:04.382 --> 57:06.179
Kill him or I will kill you.

57:07.986 --> 57:11.820
Kill him! Kill him or I will cut his head off!

57:12.057 --> 57:13.456
Kill him! Kill him!

57:15.660 --> 57:16.820
Kill him!

57:18.730 --> 57:19.788
Kill him!

58:16.087 --> 58:17.076
Shit.

58:29.501 --> 58:31.560
I brought you some molding.

58:47.752 --> 58:49.379
Hey, look,
I don't want to ruin anything, all right.

58:49.521 --> 58:52.581
I just want to be able to come over
and see the girls.

58:52.757 --> 58:55.555
Please, I would love
you to come see the girls.

59:00.565 --> 59:02.192
We just miss Sam.

59:04.769 --> 59:05.827
Yeah.

59:11.009 --> 59:12.374
That's Hank.

59:22.153 --> 59:23.916
You still at it, huh?

59:28.760 --> 59:31.388
Where did you ever learn to be so handy?

01:00:15.974 --> 01:00:17.066
Cover there!

01:00:21.112 --> 01:00:23.171
Move forward. Moving forward!

01:00:23.314 --> 01:00:24.611
Come on. Let's go.

01:00:28.119 --> 01:00:29.211
Straight ahead!

01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:31.221
- Stop right there!
- Get your hands up.

01:00:31.356 --> 01:00:33.085
Come to me. Come to me.

01:00:34.025 --> 01:00:35.617
Come on. Get your hands up.

01:00:36.294 --> 01:00:38.956
Get your hands up. Right here. Get down.

01:00:43.368 --> 01:00:44.699
You a Marine?

01:00:48.406 --> 01:00:50.374
Cahill, is that your name?

01:00:50.508 --> 01:00:52.442
Was there anyone else with you?

01:00:54.779 --> 01:00:56.371
- Come on. Ready?
- Come on.

01:01:01.319 --> 01:01:03.116
Get it on. Get it on.

01:01:03.822 --> 01:01:05.084
We need a nose.

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.715
- Mom, nose.
- Nose.

01:01:08.326 --> 01:01:09.623
- Nose!
- Here.

01:01:09.761 --> 01:01:11.956
Get the nose. Get the nose.

01:01:14.432 --> 01:01:16.297
He is looking hot, you guys.

01:01:18.103 --> 01:01:19.730
Can you teach them
how to throw snowballs?

01:01:19.871 --> 01:01:21.532
Because they can't even hit me.

01:01:25.376 --> 01:01:26.536
That one hit you.

01:01:27.512 --> 01:01:30.037
Maybe I should hit you
with a massive snowball.

01:01:31.449 --> 01:01:32.643
Come on.

01:01:33.685 --> 01:01:34.982
Izzie, Izzie, are you okay?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.247
Izzie, Izzie. Hey, hey, hey.

01:01:37.388 --> 01:01:39.288
- Are you okay?
- Grace.

01:01:39.457 --> 01:01:41.891
Sucker! Sucker.

01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:43.589
Get him! Get him!

01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:48.598
Get him. Try and get him.

01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:50.725
Hello?

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:52.930
Yes, this is she.

01:01:54.472 --> 01:01:56.440
See this cheater-pants over here.

01:01:57.242 --> 01:01:58.903
Come on. You freaked me out.

01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:12.852
- What?
- Not me.

01:02:13.892 --> 01:02:16.087
It was him! Get up.

01:02:33.578 --> 01:02:35.443
Hey. What's going on?

01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:38.646
- Uncle Tommy, she grabbed my hair.
- Okay.

01:02:38.783 --> 01:02:40.910
I'm sorry. I want to keep playing.

01:02:41.052 --> 01:02:42.246
Okay. What?

01:02:58.369 --> 01:03:00.337
- Can I go out?
- Not yet.

01:03:00.471 --> 01:03:03.929
- Why?
- Because we have to be patient. Okay?

01:03:06.878 --> 01:03:09.312
- Sir.
- Welcome home, Sam.

01:03:09.447 --> 01:03:10.573
Thanks.

01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:20.652
Daddy!

01:03:22.026 --> 01:03:24.893
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

01:03:26.197 --> 01:03:27.494
My babies.

01:04:00.098 --> 01:04:01.759
I love you, honey.

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.407
- Here, let me take your bag.
- Sure.

01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:23.578
Come on. Come on. Hurry.

01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:26.450
Do you like it? Do you like it?

01:04:26.624 --> 01:04:29.422
Wow. It's amazing.

01:04:30.295 --> 01:04:31.421
I think he likes it.

01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:34.154
- Who did it?
- Me.

01:04:34.332 --> 01:04:36.391
- You did?
- And Uncle Tommy.

01:04:36.567 --> 01:04:38.660
Uncle Tommy and 'three amigos'.

01:05:05.296 --> 01:05:06.957
Are you tired, honey?

01:05:08.433 --> 01:05:10.492
Come, get in bed. Everyone.

01:05:12.103 --> 01:05:13.536
This is fun.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.900
- I missed you, Daddy.
- Me, too.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.072
My girls.

01:05:21.913 --> 01:05:23.278
That's us, all right.

01:05:34.859 --> 01:05:36.417
Can I get up, Mom?

01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:39.826
Dad, it's not bedtime.

01:05:54.212 --> 01:05:55.873
I locked that door.

01:05:57.448 --> 01:05:58.813
It's broken.

01:06:17.535 --> 01:06:19.730
I'm just gonna finish shaving.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.468
- Banged up well, huh?
- Yeah.

01:06:56.908 --> 01:06:59.638
Can't you take that down to the mechanic?

01:07:01.946 --> 01:07:03.174
I got it.

01:07:04.382 --> 01:07:06.009
Nothing else to do.

01:07:08.986 --> 01:07:10.180
You okay?

01:07:11.956 --> 01:07:12.980
Yeah.

01:07:18.663 --> 01:07:25.193
'Cause after I got back from Nam,
I couldn't talk to your mother.

01:07:27.772 --> 01:07:32.209
I guess I took it out on you and Tommy,
you know, I...

01:07:33.077 --> 01:07:34.601
I don't know why.

01:07:37.281 --> 01:07:42.241
Look, if you ever wanna talk, let me know.
All right?

01:08:07.411 --> 01:08:08.503
You okay?

01:08:12.517 --> 01:08:13.848
You're good.

01:08:15.353 --> 01:08:17.412
Better than I thought, yeah.

01:08:18.923 --> 01:08:21.390
You look good out there with them.

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.898
Thanks for taking care of them.

01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:35.136
I didn't expect that.

01:08:35.273 --> 01:08:37.639
It just comes naturally, you know.

01:08:42.947 --> 01:08:45.471
It makes me start to think, you know.

01:08:53.658 --> 01:08:55.558
Grace is something, huh?

01:08:59.497 --> 01:09:01.020
Did you fuck her?

01:09:04.301 --> 01:09:04.926
What? You kidding?

01:09:07.705 --> 01:09:09.171
I'd understand.

01:09:11.642 --> 01:09:14.008
- You thought I was dead.
- Stop it.

01:09:15.645 --> 01:09:16.908
Tommy,

01:09:18.448 --> 01:09:19.643
I could forgive you.

01:09:30.228 --> 01:09:32.321
What's going on in your head?

01:09:33.965 --> 01:09:36.091
What's making you think that?

01:09:40.337 --> 01:09:44.899
You guys just look like
two teenagers in love out there.

01:09:46.676 --> 01:09:47.939
All right.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.774
I mean, you know?

01:09:52.015 --> 01:09:53.711
You can't deny that.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.124
You can tell me.

01:10:12.803 --> 01:10:14.668
You gotta tell me. You understand?

01:10:15.706 --> 01:10:17.970
- I know you slept in my house.
- Sam. Sam...

01:10:18.109 --> 01:10:21.044
Hey, don't bullshit me.

01:10:38.162 --> 01:10:39.857
Joe Jr., come back.

01:10:41.699 --> 01:10:43.291
Cassie, he's fine.

01:10:45.202 --> 01:10:48.694
Ever since his dad died,
I can't let him out of my sight.

01:10:49.807 --> 01:10:52.469
Look at him. He's got a mind of his own.

01:10:53.477 --> 01:10:57.538
I have this nightmare
where Joe is looking up at me,

01:10:58.416 --> 01:10:59.678
and he's trying to tell me something.

01:10:59.817 --> 01:11:02.615
He's trying to talk to me, but the teeth,

01:11:02.753 --> 01:11:06.621
his teeth just fall out of his mouth
and there is blood,

01:11:08.826 --> 01:11:12.159
and I'm scrabbling around picking them up.

01:11:13.431 --> 01:11:16.798
And then last night,
your husband was there.

01:11:18.235 --> 01:11:19.930
And he looks at my hand,
and he takes my hand,

01:11:20.071 --> 01:11:22.505
and he looks at my wedding ring
and he just smiles at me.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.906
- Did he say anything?
- No. He just smiled.

01:11:31.716 --> 01:11:34.480
In the dream, I hated him for being alive.

01:11:36.087 --> 01:11:39.113
That's why I came over to apologize.
I'm sorry.

01:11:40.524 --> 01:11:44.620
I'm sick of feeling like this all the time.
I want to forgive them.

01:11:44.795 --> 01:11:47.161
I want to be able to forgive them.

01:11:52.203 --> 01:11:53.534
Poor Joe Jr.

01:11:55.106 --> 01:11:56.232
He knows.

01:11:57.441 --> 01:12:01.172
He's just like his daddy.
He knows exactly what I'm thinking.

01:12:07.184 --> 01:12:09.084
Where are you going, huh?

01:12:12.523 --> 01:12:14.047
- Sam.
- Hi.

01:12:16.227 --> 01:12:17.956
Did you see him die?

01:12:21.932 --> 01:12:22.864
No.

01:12:23.934 --> 01:12:25.731
Did you hear anything?

01:12:26.704 --> 01:12:28.672
I mean, was he on his own?

01:12:30.374 --> 01:12:32.501
He was brave. I know that.

01:12:35.346 --> 01:12:37.177
That's Captain Cahill.

01:12:38.115 --> 01:12:40.515
He was friends with your daddy.

01:12:40.651 --> 01:12:43.984
Wave. Are you gonna wave?
Are you gonna wave?

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:47.548
You're a good man.

01:12:48.626 --> 01:12:51.220
Baby, where are you going? Come here.

01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:26.454
- Sir, Captain Cahill.
- Send him in.

01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:29.689
I want to go back, sir.

01:14:30.794 --> 01:14:32.921
I'm ready. Need to see my men.

01:14:34.098 --> 01:14:36.123
How's the counseling going?

01:14:36.567 --> 01:14:38.296
Yeah. I saw Thompson.

01:14:39.537 --> 01:14:44.736
Everything pretty good there
and, you know, just thinking about my men

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:47.901
and want to get back.

01:14:48.045 --> 01:14:49.342
That's good.

01:14:50.814 --> 01:14:52.441
How's the family?

01:14:56.053 --> 01:14:57.884
I can't be there, sir.

01:14:58.422 --> 01:14:59.446
Yeah?

01:15:01.492 --> 01:15:03.289
They don't understand.

01:15:05.796 --> 01:15:08.287
You know, I mean, nobody understands.

01:15:10.401 --> 01:15:12.835
It's gonna take a little time, Sam.

01:15:13.837 --> 01:15:15.702
You've been through a lot of shit.

01:15:17.241 --> 01:15:19.141
So has your family.

01:15:19.276 --> 01:15:20.937
I don't mind Brian.

01:15:22.046 --> 01:15:25.812
He never hits people,
only the boys, but not the girls.

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:27.645
- That is nice.
- Yeah.

01:15:28.252 --> 01:15:32.655
And he has a dog with really big ears.
I can't remember his name, though.

01:15:32.823 --> 01:15:34.017
Elephant?

01:15:38.562 --> 01:15:40.291
An elephant's not a dog.

01:15:40.698 --> 01:15:42.893
I know an elephant's not a dog.

01:15:43.033 --> 01:15:44.295
Then why did you say it?

01:15:44.435 --> 01:15:48.701
Because elephants have big ears
and so does his dog.

01:15:48.839 --> 01:15:54.334
So, big ears, get it?

01:15:54.812 --> 01:15:57.474
It's really funny if you think about it, Dad.

01:15:57.715 --> 01:15:58.773
Sam, relax.

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:00.611
But how is it funny?

01:16:01.685 --> 01:16:02.879
Big ears.

01:16:17.768 --> 01:16:22.831
- Is Dad okay, Mom?
- Yeah. Of course. Of course.

01:16:24.608 --> 01:16:26.235
When is Uncle Tommy coming?

01:16:26.377 --> 01:16:28.242
- He's coming soon, sweetie, okay?
- Okay.

01:16:28.379 --> 01:16:30.347
He wants to play with you.

01:16:31.548 --> 01:16:32.879
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:36.510
- I'm gonna go check on Daddy, okay?
- Okay.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.529
Sammy, what happened?

01:16:52.836 --> 01:16:54.394
What's going on?

01:16:55.472 --> 01:16:56.803
Talk to me.

01:16:58.642 --> 01:17:00.075
What happened?

01:17:01.712 --> 01:17:03.612
What did they do to you?

01:17:05.649 --> 01:17:07.947
What happened with you and Tommy?

01:17:21.565 --> 01:17:23.294
We kissed. That's it.

01:17:26.203 --> 01:17:27.602
I missed you.

01:17:28.772 --> 01:17:30.672
I thought you were dead.

01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:34.177
I couldn't get out of bed.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.377
That's it.

01:17:45.589 --> 01:17:49.150
- You told me the truth?
- You know.

01:17:54.965 --> 01:17:56.296
Now tell me.

01:18:14.885 --> 01:18:17.012
I think you're fucking Tommy.

01:18:17.821 --> 01:18:18.947
Sam...

01:19:06.904 --> 01:19:09.600
Come on, come on. Faster. Faster.

01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:14.600
Why did you stop pulling?

01:19:17.181 --> 01:19:18.170
Hey.

01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:21.742
You girls playing?

01:19:26.757 --> 01:19:28.190
What's wrong?

01:19:34.932 --> 01:19:36.194
It's okay.

01:19:41.138 --> 01:19:42.833
I was just confused.

01:19:46.076 --> 01:19:47.737
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:49.213 --> 01:19:51.875
Come here. Give me a hug.

01:19:53.116 --> 01:19:56.813
Now. Those are my girls.

01:20:04.928 --> 01:20:08.329
Why did the girl blush
when she opened the refrigerator?

01:20:08.498 --> 01:20:11.990
- She saw the salad dressing.
- She saw the salad dressing.

01:20:12.536 --> 01:20:13.901
I told you guys that one?

01:20:15.272 --> 01:20:16.864
A thousand times.

01:20:17.007 --> 01:20:18.941
It's still funny, though.

01:20:24.014 --> 01:20:24.241
Have fun.

01:20:50.474 --> 01:20:52.169
Where have you been?

01:20:52.542 --> 01:20:56.308
I was outside

01:20:57.447 --> 01:21:03.909
just thinking and...

01:21:11.428 --> 01:21:14.886
I was just thinking about you and the kids

01:21:15.065 --> 01:21:19.934
and the sun came up and I thought,

01:21:21.905 --> 01:21:23.839
I'm so lucky to be alive.

01:21:44.995 --> 01:21:47.793
We're gonna be late. Come on.

01:21:47.931 --> 01:21:49.364
Do you have a spelling test today?

01:21:49.499 --> 01:21:53.333
Come on, Grandpa. It's my birthday.
It's my birthday!

01:21:58.275 --> 01:22:01.142
Can I open my presents now? Please.

01:22:01.278 --> 01:22:02.870
I think we should wait.

01:22:03.013 --> 01:22:04.037
Wait for Uncle Tommy.

01:22:04.181 --> 01:22:08.811
- Pretty please.
- Well, let her open just one. It won't hurt.

01:22:09.419 --> 01:22:12.547
- You can open Grandpa's.
- Thank you.

01:22:12.723 --> 01:22:13.985
Just one.

01:22:14.157 --> 01:22:16.421
- Okay, Mom.
- Let me show you which it is.

01:22:16.593 --> 01:22:18.151
Is it the big one?

01:22:19.129 --> 01:22:20.153
It's Uncle Tommy!

01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:21.354
Let's guess.

01:22:27.971 --> 01:22:28.995
Izzie.

01:22:29.139 --> 01:22:30.436
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:33.143 --> 01:22:34.735
What's the matter?

01:22:36.079 --> 01:22:37.603
Is she okay?

01:22:38.382 --> 01:22:41.215
- Hi.
- Grace, this is Tina.

01:22:41.351 --> 01:22:42.750
- I'm Tina.
- Nice to meet you.

01:22:42.886 --> 01:22:44.786
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother's wife, Grace.

01:22:44.921 --> 01:22:47.048
We're all in the dining room.

01:22:49.192 --> 01:22:51.683
Oh, my God. She's so pretty.

01:23:01.271 --> 01:23:02.795
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:23:03.607 --> 01:23:05.040
This is Tina.

01:23:06.843 --> 01:23:08.572
She's an old friend.

01:23:09.546 --> 01:23:12.572
Actually, we just met an hour ago.

01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:16.041
Yeah. It was like an hour and a half.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.281
You got quite a charmer here.

01:23:20.724 --> 01:23:23.852
It hides inside its shell

01:23:24.027 --> 01:23:28.589
putting its head in the shell
and its arms and legs

01:23:29.566 --> 01:23:31.500
and its little tiny tail.

01:23:32.069 --> 01:23:35.630
And when the thing that's scaring him
goes like this,

01:23:36.773 --> 01:23:38.638
the turtle doesn't come out.

01:23:38.775 --> 01:23:43.906
So, the thing that scares the turtle
goes away

01:23:44.047 --> 01:23:45.810
'cause it thinks it's a rock.

01:23:45.949 --> 01:23:47.746
- You are a smart girl.
- Happy birthday.

01:23:47.884 --> 01:23:49.283
Yes, you are.

01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:54.749
- Be careful.
- Everyone needs some reassurance.

01:23:54.925 --> 01:23:56.415
Everyone's different, Dad, you know.

01:23:56.593 --> 01:23:58.618
- Stop playing with your cake.
- What do you mean?

01:23:58.795 --> 01:24:04.062
I just think it's necessary that
everybody has someone to listen to them.

01:24:04.201 --> 01:24:08.695
Right, you know, these days
they need therapy if they stub their toe.

01:24:09.339 --> 01:24:12.331
These guys are Marines.
They're trained for it.

01:24:13.143 --> 01:24:16.340
They're Marines, but they're still people,

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.385
and I don't think that anybody is trained
to shoot somebody.

01:24:22.519 --> 01:24:23.679
What do you think they are trained for?

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:28.814
I think that they're... What?
They're trained to use deadly force...

01:24:29.259 --> 01:24:31.227
- Trained to kill.
...but nobody can really be trained

01:24:31.394 --> 01:24:32.759
to watch someone die.

01:24:32.896 --> 01:24:36.593
That's just something
that you're not taught.

01:24:36.733 --> 01:24:37.722
Hey.

01:24:40.837 --> 01:24:44.773
Isabelle, let it go.

01:24:44.908 --> 01:24:46.739
Please. Thank you.

01:24:47.744 --> 01:24:49.405
So, what do you do?

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.074
- I'm going to be a nurse.
- Hey!

01:24:53.216 --> 01:24:56.185
- I'm in nursing school.
- Give it. Give it.

01:24:56.319 --> 01:24:58.116
- Dad?
- Isabelle.

01:24:59.389 --> 01:25:00.913
That's my kitty.

01:25:01.091 --> 01:25:03.491
- You're a nurse?
- I'm a nurse, sir.

01:25:04.194 --> 01:25:06.628
- Need a nurse?
- Let you know if I do.

01:25:06.763 --> 01:25:08.594
Maggie gets everything.

01:25:09.399 --> 01:25:12.300
- She got the best doll.
- It's her birthday, honey.

01:25:12.435 --> 01:25:15.563
I didn't get anything that I wanted
on my birthday.

01:25:16.973 --> 01:25:19.407
And you were in stupid Afghanistan.

01:25:24.748 --> 01:25:27.216
Nursing. How's nursing been for you, Tina?

01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:29.147
It's been a challenge.

01:25:29.653 --> 01:25:33.214
My stepfather actually encouraged me.

01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:35.952
Where did you grow up, Tina?

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.961
Just 20 miles south.
Actually, I've never really left.

01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:42.758
So... I'm gonna change that, though.

01:25:43.133 --> 01:25:44.930
I'm living at home right now which...

01:25:45.068 --> 01:25:48.504
It's kind of my home because nobody
else is really there most of the time,

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:53.803
which is good, it helps me save money
for school and stuff.

01:25:53.944 --> 01:25:56.276
- RN?
- An RN, yeah.

01:25:57.747 --> 01:26:00.409
I have another year to go,
but hopefully my grades...

01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:02.609
Isabelle, we're trying to listen
to our guest, all right?

01:26:02.752 --> 01:26:04.777
So you're in eight-hour shifts, 12-hour...

01:26:04.921 --> 01:26:09.756
Now I am praying for 12-hour shifts.
I have to get...

01:26:09.893 --> 01:26:12.726
Student loans are killing me.

01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:15.460
I don't know how anyone does it.
How did you do it?

01:26:15.599 --> 01:26:16.793
Isabelle.

01:26:20.971 --> 01:26:22.029
Stop it.

01:26:22.172 --> 01:26:23.935
What got you into it?

01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:28.468
I genuinely like people and I love...

01:26:28.778 --> 01:26:30.871
I might as well like it.

01:26:31.047 --> 01:26:32.139
Enough!

01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:36.311
Couldn't you just stay dead?

01:26:36.453 --> 01:26:37.420
Isabelle!

01:26:37.554 --> 01:26:40.489
You're just mad 'cause Mom would rather
sleep with Uncle Tommy than you.

01:26:40.657 --> 01:26:42.557
Isabelle! Why would you say that?

01:26:42.692 --> 01:26:44.990
Mom and Uncle Tommy had sex all the time.

01:26:45.128 --> 01:26:46.254
Enough!

01:27:13.023 --> 01:27:14.615
Can I go home now?

01:27:15.925 --> 01:27:17.517
I wanna go to bed.

01:27:37.647 --> 01:27:38.978
Sorry, Mom.

01:27:45.822 --> 01:27:48.689
Why did you say that?
You know it's not true.

01:27:51.995 --> 01:27:53.553
I don't like Dad.

01:27:56.099 --> 01:28:00.331
I'd rather have Uncle Tommy around
instead of Dad.

01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:03.131
Me, too.

01:28:07.043 --> 01:28:09.204
Daddy's gonna be better, okay?

01:28:10.613 --> 01:28:12.774
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:28:15.552 --> 01:28:16.883
Thanks, Mom.

01:28:20.457 --> 01:28:24.018
- Mom, I love you.
- I love you, baby.

01:28:48.918 --> 01:28:52.149
Elsie, I don't know what he's gonna do.

01:28:55.558 --> 01:28:57.219
Where are you going?

01:28:59.896 --> 01:29:01.887
It's none of your damn business, you know.

01:29:04.367 --> 01:29:06.562
Just stay the hell out of it.

01:29:07.971 --> 01:29:10.030
You gotta call the police, Hank.

01:29:21.684 --> 01:29:23.117
What is that?

01:29:27.123 --> 01:29:29.717
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

01:29:33.129 --> 01:29:35.063
- They all tucked in?
- Yeah.

01:29:37.133 --> 01:29:38.725
Say their prayers?

01:29:41.871 --> 01:29:42.803
Good.

01:29:47.811 --> 01:29:48.835
Sam?

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.469
Sam?

01:29:53.883 --> 01:29:56.317
What am I supposed to do now, Grace?

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:21.640
- You know what I did to get back to you?
- No.

01:30:21.778 --> 01:30:25.236
You know what I did
to fucking get back to you?

01:30:25.748 --> 01:30:27.807
You fucking bitch!

01:30:30.019 --> 01:30:32.351
You know how he fucking suffered?

01:30:32.489 --> 01:30:34.821
He fucking suffered because of you!

01:30:34.991 --> 01:30:39.394
And what have you done to my
fucking house and my fucking kids, Grace?

01:30:39.562 --> 01:30:41.894
- You're fucking my brother.
- Sam, you know I didn't.

01:30:42.131 --> 01:30:44.895
You're fucking my brother
in my fucking house!

01:30:45.034 --> 01:30:46.797
- Sam, please.
- I love you, Grace!

01:30:46.936 --> 01:30:49.905
- Please, our girls, please.
- You know how much I love you?

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:55.209
You know what I...
Grace, do you know what I fucking...

01:30:56.079 --> 01:30:59.981
You know what I had to do
with these fucking hands, Grace?

01:31:00.416 --> 01:31:02.316
You... Fuck!

01:31:05.555 --> 01:31:07.750
God, fuck!

01:31:11.895 --> 01:31:13.795
What are you doing here?

01:31:29.345 --> 01:31:30.573
Come on, man.

01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:50.961
- Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
- What are you fucking doing?

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.192
Go to your room.

01:31:52.335 --> 01:31:54.360
- Fuck. What are you doing, Tommy?
- Okay.

01:31:54.504 --> 01:31:57.200
- What the fuck are you doing to me?
- Girls, lock the door.

01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:59.240
Behind my fucking back!

01:32:01.144 --> 01:32:03.044
- Did you call the cops?
- Hold on.

01:32:03.179 --> 01:32:05.943
- Did you call the fucking cops?
- All right. All right. All right.

01:32:19.929 --> 01:32:21.794
Is there a disturbance?

01:32:25.501 --> 01:32:26.900
Hold back.

01:32:27.036 --> 01:32:28.298
What are you doing here?

01:32:28.438 --> 01:32:29.928
- Drop your weapon.
- What are you doing?

01:32:30.073 --> 01:32:32.871
- Hold on. Put your gun down.
- Tommy, go back in the house.

01:32:33.009 --> 01:32:36.206
- What are you doing, huh?
- Put your weapon down, Captain.

01:32:36.346 --> 01:32:37.278
You know me?

01:32:37.413 --> 01:32:38.675
- Just shut up for a second, okay?
- You know me, huh?

01:32:38.815 --> 01:32:41.010
- I know your father, sir.
- Stay back!

01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:43.380
- Stay back!
- All right. All right. All right.

01:32:43.519 --> 01:32:46.010
- You're a war hero, sir.
- I'm no fucking hero!

01:32:46.155 --> 01:32:48.623
I'm no fucking hero!
You know what I've done?

01:32:48.791 --> 01:32:51.089
- Hey, it's all right. Sam!
- Just relax.

01:32:51.227 --> 01:32:52.353
- Sam!
- Put the gun down, Sam.

01:32:52.528 --> 01:32:54.519
- Put the gun down.
- What are you gonna do?

01:32:54.697 --> 01:32:55.994
You gonna shoot me?

01:32:56.132 --> 01:32:57.360
- Put the gun down!
- Sam!

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:00.264
- Fucking shoot me! Shoot me!
- Hold your fire. Nobody shoot!

01:33:00.403 --> 01:33:01.927
Shoot me! Come on!

01:33:02.071 --> 01:33:05.905
Jesus, shut the fuck up!
This is a family matter. Shut up!

01:33:06.042 --> 01:33:07.441
Shut up. He's my brother.

01:33:07.577 --> 01:33:09.135
- Just stop for a second.
- Put the gun down, sir.

01:33:09.278 --> 01:33:12.270
- Just let me talk to him. He's my brother.
- Give him a minute.

01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.152
- Sam!
- You are my brother, Sam!

01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:23.114
Sam!

01:33:32.702 --> 01:33:36.900
You're my brother. You're my family.

01:33:41.244 --> 01:33:42.711
Do you hear me?

01:33:45.348 --> 01:33:46.542
Sam!

01:34:04.367 --> 01:34:06.164
What's going on, Sam?

01:34:08.304 --> 01:34:09.999
I'm drowning, Tommy.

01:34:16.412 --> 01:34:18.437
Go. Go, go. Get on the ground!

01:34:18.881 --> 01:34:20.644
- Gun clear. Get down.
- Get on the ground now!

01:34:20.783 --> 01:34:21.977
Get down!

01:34:22.118 --> 01:34:24.086
- Give me your hand.
- Give me your hand.

01:34:26.723 --> 01:34:28.884
On your knees. On your knees.

01:34:31.594 --> 01:34:32.891
Get him up.

01:36:12.495 --> 01:36:14.087
<i>My darling Grace,</i>

01:36:16.032 --> 01:36:20.401
<i>if you're reading this,
it means I didn't make it back.</i>

01:36:22.605 --> 01:36:24.869
<i>Nothing is certain in this life.</i>

01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:32.147
<i>The only thing I know for sure
is that I love you and our girls.</i>

01:36:34.517 --> 01:36:36.644
<i>That is the only thing I know.</i>

01:36:46.128 --> 01:36:50.030
- Hello?
- Hey, Tommy. It's Sam.

01:36:50.666 --> 01:36:51.690
Hey.

01:36:56.372 --> 01:37:01.776
I was just thinking about you.

01:37:02.879 --> 01:37:05.905
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm good.

01:37:06.916 --> 01:37:10.079
Just calling. Yeah.

01:37:14.724 --> 01:37:16.658
You're my brother, Tommy.

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:33.408
When is your birthday, Uncle Tommy?

01:37:56.365 --> 01:37:59.698
Okay, sir. You know the drill.
We'll see you in about 30 minutes.

01:38:32.802 --> 01:38:34.531
Sam, tell me what happened.

01:38:42.745 --> 01:38:47.045
Sam, what happened?

01:38:50.853 --> 01:38:53.117
Why are you punishing yourself?

01:39:08.137 --> 01:39:10.799
I've loved you since I was 16 years old.

01:39:11.807 --> 01:39:13.240
You know that?

01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:17.702
If you don't tell me what happened,
you're not gonna see me again.

01:39:42.738 --> 01:39:44.137
I killed him.

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.175
I killed Joe Willis.

01:40:06.529 --> 01:40:10.431
<i>I don't know who said,
"Only the dead have seen the end of war."</i>

01:40:12.835 --> 01:40:14.860
<i>I have seen the end of war.</i>

01:40:17.573 --> 01:40:23.034
<i>The question is, can I live again?</i>
