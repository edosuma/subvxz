01:45.005 --> 01:46.073
- Hey!

01:46.140 --> 01:47.675
What's taking so long?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.949
Ahh, there she is.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.251
Whatcha got?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.220
Prune juice and
Neosporin.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.454
You do love me.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.022
Actually,
I changed my mind,

02:02.089 --> 02:03.123
and I'm not gonna
work at home today.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.925
I'm gonna--
 I'm gonna go.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.828
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
 You're not goin' anywhere.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.128
You're gonna stay here.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.931
You're gonna be
 my little nurse.

02:10.997 --> 02:14.835
I have a lot of work to do,
 and I just can't do it here.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.970
I can help you with that,
 just come on.

02:17.037 --> 02:20.140
I mean, that's--
 I know, bring--
 I'll bring food.

02:20.208 --> 02:23.076
No, please don't
 leave me alone
 with my thoughts.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.280
- and I'll be back.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.616
- Bye.
- Okay.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.684
Love you.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.220
Love you, too.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.762
- How was your room?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.664
- Well, I'm pretty sure
 I didn't get bedbugs.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.832
Oh, congrats.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.000
- Are you hungry?
 - Yeah.

02:47.067 --> 02:51.071
Yelp says there's a diner
 with a strong waffle game
 about a mile up.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.241
What makes a strong
waffle game?

02:53.307 --> 02:54.742
Well, honestly, uh,
 you know,

02:54.808 --> 02:57.245
a waffle is just
 a delivery system

02:57.311 --> 02:58.846
for the butter
 and the syrup,

02:58.912 --> 03:00.248
so I'm gonna go with
 the butter and the syrup.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.184
I've never actually
 called out before today.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.287
Whatever. If he fires me,
 I'll just go somewhere else.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.622
It's not like there isn't
 a million places
 I can go dance.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.824
It's kind of like
 being a nurse.

03:10.891 --> 03:15.095
I-- I'm pretty sure
 what you do is a little more
 interesting than that.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.031
It's actually way less crazy
 than everyone thinks.

03:18.098 --> 03:22.270
It's mostly just sad guys
 with cocaine problems.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.138
Sounds like
the music business.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.408
Come on,
 you guys probably sit
 in swivel chairs,

03:27.475 --> 03:31.044
and eat ice cream sandwiches
 all day.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.146
We do not.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.584
We sit in swivel chairs
and drink coconut water
all day, okay?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.587
I like coconut water.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.455
Me, too.

03:41.522 --> 03:45.259
I don't know,
 I feel like
 when I was a kid

03:45.326 --> 03:49.229
I imagined a very different
picture of success.

03:49.297 --> 03:52.199
When I was a kid
 I was a terror.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.502
I used to drive
 on mushrooms.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.137
Drive, like,
 automotive vehicles?

03:57.204 --> 03:58.506
I was out of control.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.174
Um, I think I'm glad
 I met you now.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.776
Oh, honey,
 I know you are.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.050
Come with me
 on the journey

04:10.117 --> 04:12.420
to Shell and Back.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.356
To Shell and Back.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.790
- Okay, now--
 - Which one's better?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.459
Well, they were both
 wonderful.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.959
Play with it, have fun,
but listen, listen--

04:20.027 --> 04:21.795
Okay, I-- I'm having
 a little trouble.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.031
- My neck is getting
a little--
- It's okay, it's okay.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.133
- I have a little vertigo.
 - Now when I come around,

04:26.199 --> 04:27.668
say your line.

04:27.735 --> 04:32.239
Come with me on the journey
 to Shell and Back.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.841
Again.

04:33.907 --> 04:37.345
Come with me on the journey
 to Shell and Back.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.413
- And--
 - And now I have to throw up.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.014
.. Oy! Gotenyu.
 Buzzy, was that all right?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.850
- It was great.
- Oh, good.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.852
- Oh, good. Good.
- I'm sure we got good,
good, good, stuff.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.119
Good. All right.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.456
- Did it sound good?
 - Sounded great.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.124
The best ever.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.328
- Oooh.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.831
Oh.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.301
This is some camera.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.404
- Yeah.
- How much did it cost?

05:03.471 --> 05:06.807
Uh... a little over
a thousand bucks.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.510
Look, Shell,
 this is prosumer.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.844
With a couple of good lenses,

05:10.911 --> 05:13.414
we can compete with
movies in theaters.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.682
Well, I don't see why we
couldn't have just borrowed

05:14.748 --> 05:16.350
a camera from Sarah and Len.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.952
They got that really nice one
 for Zachary's bris.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.021
A few years ago,
 but still--

05:21.088 --> 05:23.491
I mean, and I thought
 that trial take that
 we did on my phone,

05:23.557 --> 05:24.825
I thought that looked
 really great.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.928
Babe, this is
 an investment in you.

05:27.995 --> 05:31.264
You deserve this.
 You deserve this.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.575
Buzzy, sweetheart,
 I don't want to be
 a noodge,

05:41.642 --> 05:46.614
but, uh, you've racked up
 a lot of electronics

05:46.680 --> 05:48.281
on my credit cards recently,

05:48.348 --> 05:51.218
and I don't want to
max them out and pay
a lot of interest.

05:51.284 --> 05:52.520
Relax, babe,
 I got a system.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.588
Yeah, what system?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.457
I enrolled you in
 a points program.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.760
It's free to join
 and everything you buy
 gets you points.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.563
And then we
 return the stuff,
 keep the points.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.398
All these points
 are good for travel.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.567
It's amazing
 more people haven't
 figured it out.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.468
What if this stuff
 gets damaged

06:07.535 --> 06:08.836
and I'm stuck with it?

06:08.902 --> 06:09.870
I'm not an amateur,
 Shell.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.705
It's just so complicated.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.675
You know what?
 I-- I can't stand
 to see this--

06:14.742 --> 06:16.777
this long face.
 Come here, come here.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.712
Wait!
What are you doing?

06:18.779 --> 06:22.950
I'm gonna let you in
 on my-- on my little
 surprise.

06:23.016 --> 06:26.053
I'm working up to
 a big reunion,

06:26.119 --> 06:29.322
and I almost have
 enough points with
 everything we've got.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.559
A big reunion with what?

06:31.625 --> 06:34.595
Cruise tickets for
 the entire family.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.465
Really?
Oh, my--

06:37.531 --> 06:40.701
There's that
 beautiful smile.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.903
Oh, G--

06:42.970 --> 06:44.004
Don't move.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.686
Give me your glasses.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.053
Take my glasses,
 babe.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.434
All right.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.904
Thank you.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.438
- I'd just like to say

07:18.506 --> 07:22.075
I saw an old woman
 walking the other day.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.745
Hunched and hunched.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.147
Oh, dear, this mean world.

07:27.214 --> 07:31.418
How the wind tried to
 blow her down.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.453
Um, I need some coffee.
Some coffee.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.288
- Yeah.
- You here for
the open mic?

07:35.355 --> 07:37.024
No, we're just
 driving through.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.492
- So--
- Cool.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.260
So, yeah,
 two coffees?

07:40.327 --> 07:41.595
- Yes, please.
 - Um--

07:43.396 --> 07:49.870
- ...gripped the walker
in defiance of the gust.

07:49.937 --> 07:53.173
They didn't get the memo
 about sun dried tomatoes.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.143
Mm.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.712
I used to work at
 Wrapped It Up
 in high school.

07:58.779 --> 08:02.015
And we put this
 nasty pink sauce
 in everything.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.117
And the manager used to
run around going,

08:04.184 --> 08:05.653
"No dry bites."

08:05.719 --> 08:07.521
"No dry bites."

08:07.588 --> 08:08.689
Over and over.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.223
I do hate a dry bite.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.660
Yeah, I do, too.

08:12.726 --> 08:17.264
And it said, brother,
 you gotta understand.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.132
We are the brave men.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.870
Brave like boulders
 battling the sun each day.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.173
Our faces the hardened son
 of warriors,

08:26.239 --> 08:28.075
battle and battle
 to keep safe.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.078
I'll be right back.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.513
- And the boys
 went off to war.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.816
- And the war went on.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.083
And on.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.219
And on.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.020
And on.

08:41.087 --> 08:45.358
- Give it up
 for Ron, everybody.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.760
Yeah.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.596
Okay, I guess
 that's it for today.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.997
I want to thank you guys
 for coming out.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.133
Oh, yeah, sure.
 Come on up here, bro.

08:55.202 --> 09:01.474
Um, hi, everybody.
 Um, my name's, um...

09:01.541 --> 09:03.744
Kevin Johnson.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.680
Um, and I'm from Dallas.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.650
Haven't played in a while,
 so hopefully this won't be
 too painful.

09:26.499 --> 09:30.804
* We can make it
 in another world *

09:30.871 --> 09:34.808
* Where money
 doesn't equal time *

09:34.875 --> 09:37.745
* Time is not
 a number on the wall *

09:37.811 --> 09:42.549
* Wall don't keep
what's yours from mine *

09:42.616 --> 09:47.154
* We can make it
 in another world *

09:47.220 --> 09:51.291
* Where who we are is not
 the same as what we do *

09:51.358 --> 09:54.795
* And what we do
 comes from love *

09:54.862 --> 10:00.167
* Love is a language
and the words are true *

10:00.233 --> 10:04.404
* Make a map
 to another world *

10:04.471 --> 10:09.142
* Set your clock
 for another time *

10:09.209 --> 10:12.145
* The here the now
 is chiming *

10:12.212 --> 10:16.416
* Do you hear it chiming?

10:16.483 --> 10:20.253
* Make a map
 to another world *

10:20.320 --> 10:24.324
* Set your clock
 for another time *

10:24.391 --> 10:27.661
* The here the now
 is chiming *

10:27.728 --> 10:31.164
* Do you hear it chiming?

10:59.092 --> 11:03.330
* Make a map
 to another world *

11:03.396 --> 11:08.035
* Set your clock
 for another time *

11:08.101 --> 11:11.538
* The here the now
 is chiming *

11:11.604 --> 11:16.443
* Do you hear it chiming?

11:16.509 --> 11:20.447
* Make a map
 to another world *

11:20.513 --> 11:24.785
* Set your clock
 for another time *

11:24.852 --> 11:28.221
* The here the now
 is chiming *

11:28.288 --> 11:31.358
* Do you hear it chiming?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.608
- You know, for someone
 who never has a Seder,

11:48.675 --> 11:50.510
you got a lot of
Seder stuff.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.646
- Remember this?
 - Oh, you found
 the Seder plate.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.949
Oh, I love that.

11:56.016 --> 12:00.653
You remember that big,
 famous, hideous Seder
 of 1995.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.089
Remember that?

12:02.155 --> 12:03.723
- With Aunt Brina?
 - Oh, my God, yeah.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.525
Right? She was on
 OJ's side.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.726
What did she keep saying?

12:06.794 --> 12:08.128
Nicole was lucky
 to have him.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.662
How many times
 did she scream that?

12:09.729 --> 12:14.067
- I mean, yeah.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.936
What is all this crap?

12:16.003 --> 12:17.370
What are you doing?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.372
Are you, like, starting
a spy operation?

12:19.439 --> 12:20.640
What is happening here?

12:20.707 --> 12:22.542
It's all this
 electronic equipment

12:22.609 --> 12:24.912
that Buzzy thought
 was very important
 for us to have

12:24.978 --> 12:26.880
for my one woman show,
 "To Shell and Back."

12:26.947 --> 12:28.715
This is super expensive.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.784
I mean,
 who paid for this?

12:32.820 --> 12:34.888
I did.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.491
- Uh-huh.
 - My show, my responsibility.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.426
Uh-huh.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.497
Does he pay rent?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.333
- What?
 - I mean, I know that
 he moved in.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.001
Please tell me that
he pays rent, at least.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.769
He's paying you rent.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.939
You're not
taking care of him,
are you?

12:52.005 --> 12:54.107
Oh, that is a very
 sexist thing to say.

12:54.174 --> 12:58.345
If I were an older man,
 and he was a booby blondie,

12:58.411 --> 13:01.148
nobody would think twice
 about my supporting him.
 Would they?

13:02.515 --> 13:05.085
Okay, that is, like,
completely irrelevant,

13:05.152 --> 13:06.253
not one thing of
what you just said

13:06.319 --> 13:08.155
is actually what
the situation is.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.656
- Well, you know
what I mean.
- No.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.824
Actually, I don't know.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.192
I mean, he's a
 fully grown man,

13:12.259 --> 13:16.897
and he-- he's just spent
 thousands of dollars on
 equipment you don't need.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.968
I am... happy.

13:21.034 --> 13:24.938
I am very happy.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.807
Let me be happy.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.609
This the kiddush cup?

13:29.676 --> 13:32.245
No. It's a vase from
 the Jewish Museum in
 New York.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.281
It'll pass for
a kiddush cup.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.254
- Yes, and that was
the end of Jack.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.124
Took me a month
 to find my cat.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.894
He dumped her at
 the animal shelter,
 you know.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.963
Which led to Doug.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.731
Who I met
 at the animal shelter.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.167
Dropping off
or picking up?

13:54.234 --> 13:55.835
Uh, no,
 he worked there.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.538
Oh. At least he was
gainfully employed.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.508
Yeah.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.285
You know,
 dating while trans
 is a real shit show.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.154
If you don't get
 the pussy,

14:14.221 --> 14:17.190
you're festishized by a bunch
 of cock-hungry Johns.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.392
And if you do get it,

14:19.459 --> 14:23.130
you know,
 you're still stigmatized.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.965
It's like a no win
 situation.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.501
All my girlfriends
 told me not to bother
 with bottom surgery,

14:28.568 --> 14:31.871
they said I'd be
 giving up my coin machine.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.873
Jesus.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.575
I even had a
 trans auntie tell me,

14:35.642 --> 14:38.411
"Miss Shea, girl,
 don't you go get
 that pussy, darling.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.349
"You know what they say?
 A chick with a dick
 is always paid."

14:46.519 --> 14:49.756
But that--
 that's assuming that

14:49.822 --> 14:51.524
you're gonna be,
like, a sex worker.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.094
Like, forever.
Or whatever.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.096
I mean,
 what about--

14:56.163 --> 14:59.099
I don't know,
maybe even having a family.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.669
My foot's asleep.
 You wanna drive?

15:02.735 --> 15:05.338
Yeah. Here.
 Pull up right over here.

15:10.877 --> 15:11.911
All right.

15:14.948 --> 15:15.983
My shift.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.528
Are you seeing this?

15:28.595 --> 15:31.431
What the hell is this?

15:31.498 --> 15:33.800
Um...

15:33.866 --> 15:36.836
it's a thing of majesty,
 I believe.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.372
Should we, uh,
 investigate?

15:39.439 --> 15:42.509
- Of course.
 - All right.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.819
- Miss Pfefferman.
 - Hi.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.621
- How are you doing?
 - I'm good, thanks,
 how are you?

15:54.687 --> 15:57.057
I'm really good.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.026
So, I hear you're
 having some pain.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.460
Well, let's take a look,
 shall we?

16:00.527 --> 16:03.830
Wait, uh,
I get a little nervous
around this stuff.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.765
Last time
you gave me, um,

16:05.832 --> 16:07.367
some-- some of that gas.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.636
Yeah, last time
 we gave you 40.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.870
How'd that feel?

16:10.937 --> 16:12.205
- Uh, good.
 - Good.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.940
I mean, maybe,
I don't know,

16:14.007 --> 16:16.343
I could use, like,
 10 percent more,
 just 'cause--

16:16.409 --> 16:17.744
Katrinka!

16:19.912 --> 16:22.415
- We'll get you handled.
- Great, thanks.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.119
* Her blood is
 our blood, too *

16:26.186 --> 16:28.121
* I know

16:29.922 --> 16:33.926
* And I feel
 all of it, too *

16:33.993 --> 16:35.695
* You know

16:35.762 --> 16:36.763
* You know

16:39.132 --> 16:41.568
- Did you just
 fuckin' open that?
 - Yeah.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.103
Wait, I'm
like stuck.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.638
* 1936 breathing

16:45.705 --> 16:48.208
* Garnet her stone
 ever gleaming *

16:48.275 --> 16:49.676
- Clean through.
- Are you in?

16:49.742 --> 16:52.379
* And Edith's hope
 is for love *

16:52.445 --> 16:56.649
* But she doesn't hear of
 her grandchildren grieving *

16:56.716 --> 17:01.054
* No, eldest raised by
 Al Ringling *

17:01.121 --> 17:05.192
* Spirit granted
 from Sing Sing *

17:05.258 --> 17:08.060
* And all of her heart
 is for drugs *

17:08.127 --> 17:13.066
* And she doesn't care that
 everyone is leaving *

17:13.133 --> 17:18.771
* Her blood is
 our blood, too, I know *

17:18.838 --> 17:20.406
You're always
trying to race me.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.540
Not bad.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.477
* I feel all of it, too

17:24.544 --> 17:26.579
* You know,
 you know *

17:28.781 --> 17:30.883
* Her blood is
 our blood, too *

17:30.950 --> 17:32.952
Ho!

17:34.387 --> 17:37.390
- Watch out!

17:37.457 --> 17:40.227
* I feel all of it, too

17:40.293 --> 17:44.631
* You know

17:49.702 --> 17:55.175
You're fuckin' fast.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.645
I just had a notion.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.647
What's your notion?

18:00.713 --> 18:04.284
Um, like when a guy's
 having sex with a girl,
 he's like,

18:04.351 --> 18:06.052
always in the back
 of his mind, he's like,

18:06.119 --> 18:07.220
I might get this girl
 pregnant.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.988
Not good.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.158
But, like, with you,
 it's like...

18:11.224 --> 18:13.726
not possible, so,
 I don't know,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.128
you could just relax.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.096
Like, go all out.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.265
- That's--
 - I'm just--

18:18.331 --> 18:20.133
That's fucked up.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.169
Wait, why? I--
 It's like a positive.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.170
- I'm--
- That's what you go to?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.871
That's the positive?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.974
It's a positive.
 I'm just tryin' to say--

18:28.040 --> 18:31.444
It's like, I don't see why
 it would ever be a negative
 for anybody.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.546
It's, like, great.
 I mean--

18:58.605 --> 18:59.639
I'm sorry.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.912
It's such a fucking
 stupid thing to say.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.217
I'm a fuckin' idiot.
 Okay?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.484
Hey.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.884
So dumb.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.401
Ready for lift off?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.673
* Is there anybody
 out there? *

20:14.981 --> 20:16.383
- Spin the wheel!

20:16.449 --> 20:17.484
Is there a P?

20:17.550 --> 20:18.951
Is there a P?

20:19.018 --> 20:20.887
- Is there an F?
- Is there an F?

20:20.953 --> 20:24.491
- Where are you?
 - 18, 36, 72.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.126
- The great mystery.
Goddess. Chahina.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.461
I'd like to solve
 the puzzle.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.529
I'd like to solve
the puzzle.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.997
I'd like to solve
the puzzle.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.799
Do you know why
 Rita killed herself?

20:32.865 --> 20:35.134
- It's so sad.
 - Yes, it is.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.003
I have a huge hole
 in my heart.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.471
- Of course you do.
 - Are you God?

20:38.538 --> 20:39.572
- Goddess.
 - Do you love me?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.740
- Forever.
 - Really?

20:40.807 --> 20:42.542
- Really.
 - Why is he lost?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.277
I think you know, Ali.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.778
- Well, what do I do?

20:45.845 --> 20:47.714
- What do you think
you should do?

20:47.780 --> 20:50.317
- God.
 - Goddess.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.788
We'll be right back.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.131
You're back.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.433
Yes, I am.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.204
You okay?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.541
Yes.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.343
I'm gonna let you
hang out here for
a few minutes. No rush.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.511
Okay.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.080
Wait, no, I'm sorry,
 I just--

21:21.147 --> 21:23.049
So many things just became
 clear to me, and I just--

21:23.115 --> 21:25.051
Can I say them out loud
 before I forget them?

21:25.117 --> 21:27.487
Okay.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.256
I just saw God.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.825
Okay.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.427
What-- What'd he say?

21:34.494 --> 21:36.228
Uh, that she's a woman.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.498
Uh-huh.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.667
And she's black.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.801
Uh-huh.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.603
And she looked
 just like you,

21:43.670 --> 21:46.506
and told me everything is
 what it's supposed to be,

21:46.573 --> 21:51.277
and that it's gonna be okay,
 we're gonna be--

21:51.344 --> 21:52.812
We're gonna be okay.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.147
Mm.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.750
And I can tell you're
 still not flossing.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.382
- Hi.
 - Hey, what's up?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.172
Hey, um--

22:53.239 --> 22:55.408
What?

22:55.475 --> 22:56.609
Wait.

22:56.676 --> 22:57.977
- Just--
- What?

22:58.044 --> 23:00.279
Can you just stop
 for a second?

23:00.346 --> 23:03.916
- Uh--
- What?

23:05.852 --> 23:09.355
There's just something
 I have to--

23:09.422 --> 23:11.057
To talk to you about.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.325
Okay.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.862
Look,
 I'm totally healthy and...

23:15.928 --> 23:17.597
my viral load
 is undetectable,

23:19.098 --> 23:21.434
and there's really
 nothing to worry about,

23:21.501 --> 23:24.003
but I just have to
 tell you that I'm
 HIV positive.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.708
I have to.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.510
Just don't want you
 to find out later,

23:30.577 --> 23:33.513
and hate me or
 murder me or something.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.381
I'm mean, we're--
we're just kissing,

23:35.448 --> 23:36.949
I mean,
 you can't get it
 from kissing, right?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.585
No, you can't get it
 from kissing.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.288
Okay. Yeah.

23:42.354 --> 23:45.157
Um, I'm not gonna--
I'm not gonna--

23:45.224 --> 23:48.127
I'm not gonna murder you.
 I'm not gonna hate you.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.662
Um, it's cool.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.338
So you okay?

23:59.405 --> 24:00.473
Yeah.

24:04.811 --> 24:08.380
I have some condoms
 in the car.

24:08.447 --> 24:12.885
Um, are condoms,
 like, 100 percent?

24:12.952 --> 24:13.953
They work?

24:19.025 --> 24:22.662
Look, there's, uh--
 there's this pill
 called Prep,

24:22.729 --> 24:27.099
and it pretty much
 eliminates any chance

24:27.166 --> 24:30.637
of you getting it
 if you want to--

24:30.703 --> 24:35.542
Um... pretty much?

24:35.608 --> 24:38.177
Well, they're still
 researching it, so--

24:38.244 --> 24:41.447
Okay. You have it
 here with you?

24:41.514 --> 24:44.717
Uh, no, I don't
 have it here.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.553
It doesn't
 work like that.

24:46.619 --> 24:47.854
Okay.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.960
It would be more like
 if you wanted to

24:54.026 --> 24:57.329
slow things down
 and figure out
 where this is going.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.465
Maybe we could
 see a doctor
 when we get back.

24:59.532 --> 25:03.435
Like, explore this
 more long term.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.270
Long term?

25:10.309 --> 25:11.944
It's just--

25:12.011 --> 25:13.445
That's a lot of build up.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.582
I mean--

25:15.648 --> 25:17.750
Let's just go.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.018
Are you mad?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.519
Yeah, I'm mad.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.989
At me? Why?

25:23.055 --> 25:24.523
- Why?
 - Yeah. I'm, like--

25:24.591 --> 25:26.492
I've been totally cool
 with everything.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.527
Yeah, you know,
 you deserve an award.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.462
What a hero.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.265
Okay, you just were
about to fuck me,

25:33.332 --> 25:35.534
and, like, probably
 not give me HIV. Okay?

25:35.602 --> 25:37.937
I'm not allowed to
ask some questions?

25:38.004 --> 25:40.172
I'm not allowed to,
like, pause,

25:40.239 --> 25:41.641
and, like, feel weird?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.843
Why the fuck
 did you bring me here?

25:43.910 --> 25:46.445
What-- I brought you here
 because it seemed fun.

25:46.512 --> 25:47.513
- Like, this is fun.
 - Fun?

25:47.580 --> 25:49.048
- Yeah, you seem fun.
 - Fun?

25:49.115 --> 25:52.051
Like a sex worker
 good time fun, Josh?

25:52.118 --> 25:52.785
No. Okay, well,
 now that you mention it,

25:52.852 --> 25:54.787
I did pay for all this.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.555
Fuck you, Josh!

25:57.957 --> 26:00.292
You needed a fucking date
 to go tell your son

26:00.359 --> 26:03.996
his mother killed herself?

26:04.063 --> 26:08.534
I see right through you,
 and I'm not your fucking
 adventure!

26:08.601 --> 26:10.169
I'm a person!

26:10.236 --> 26:12.905
I'm not your
 fucking adventure!

26:12.972 --> 26:14.106
Grow up!

26:14.173 --> 26:15.842
You fucking child!

26:15.908 --> 26:17.209
Fuck you!

26:33.492 --> 26:37.529
Denver airport,
please?

26:37.596 --> 26:38.665
Hey.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.006
I'm sorry.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.313
I don't--
I don't know
what I'm doing.

27:03.589 --> 27:11.130
* One golden light
 bleeding into the dark *

27:11.197 --> 27:18.805
* Windows play movies
 out onto the yard *

27:18.871 --> 27:26.078
* Pictures of people
 I don't even know *

27:26.145 --> 27:32.418
* Living a life
 that I lived so long ago *

27:46.833 --> 27:53.005
* One golden light
 bleeding into the dark *

27:54.440 --> 28:01.013
* Windows play movies
 that I know by heart *
