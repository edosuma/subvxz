WEBVTT

00:01.104 --> 00:02.506
(Jim)
All right, let's get started.

00:02.538 --> 00:04.109
Oh, first off,

00:04.143 --> 00:05.311
we're supposed to be
pushing card stock this week,

00:05.345 --> 00:08.784
so...let's push card stock
this week.

00:08.818 --> 00:12.826
Uh, also--
What is this?

00:12.859 --> 00:14.196
Tape recorder.

00:14.229 --> 00:15.332
For what?

00:15.365 --> 00:17.603
For recording.

00:17.636 --> 00:18.571
Michael is on vacation,

00:18.605 --> 00:20.508
and he has asked me
to record all meetings

00:20.542 --> 00:21.810
and to type up the transcripts.

00:21.844 --> 00:24.816
Okay, uh, Karen, I need news
from that law firm.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.287
Yeah, the deal
closed yesterday.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.623
It's a 6-month commitment.

00:27.656 --> 00:29.160
Oh, my God.
Dwight, what are you doing?

00:29.192 --> 00:30.494
What?

00:30.528 --> 00:32.099
You're not allowed
to take off your pants

00:32.133 --> 00:33.467
in the middle of the office.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.438
I'm not.
Dwight, you know what?
Just back off.

00:35.471 --> 00:36.574
Okay, that's
making me uncomfortable.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.711
This is sexual harassment,
by the way.

00:38.745 --> 00:39.879
Oh, my God.

00:39.912 --> 00:40.849
He's got a knife!

00:40.881 --> 00:42.518
I do not have a knife.

00:42.552 --> 00:44.723
No. Let the record show
that Dwight K. Schrute

00:44.757 --> 00:47.462
is now completely nude
and is holding a plastic knife

00:47.495 --> 00:48.464
to Stanley's neck.

00:48.497 --> 00:49.700
(Dwight)
Let the record show

00:49.733 --> 00:51.503
that Jim Halpert
is a liar.

00:51.536 --> 00:53.375
Dwight Schrute is now
wearing a baby's bonnet.

00:53.407 --> 00:54.442
I am not.

00:54.476 --> 00:55.511
Oh, Jim Carrey
just walked in.

00:55.544 --> 00:57.283
Dwight, get his autograph
for Michael, quickly.

00:57.316 --> 00:58.850
(Dwight)
Jim Carrey did not
just walk in, okay?

00:58.885 --> 01:00.121
Dwight, what is that
on your stomach?

01:00.121 --> 01:01.924
Is that
a Muppet Babies tattoo?

01:01.957 --> 01:02.859
(Jim)
Oh, my God, Karen,
you're right.

01:02.892 --> 01:03.861
That is Animal

01:03.894 --> 01:05.431
from the Muppet Babies.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.733
You can't see my stomach.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.935
I am not chopping off
Phyllis' head

01:07.969 --> 01:10.574
with a chainsaw!

01:13.414 --> 01:16.420
[imitates engine revving,
clears throat]

01:16.454 --> 01:19.426
[cheerful music]

01:19.460 --> 01:27.476
*

01:56.301 --> 01:58.371
[Jamaican accent]
Hey, mon.

01:58.405 --> 02:00.241
Hey.
Look.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.678
You have a bunch
of messages, and--

02:02.713 --> 02:03.680
That's nice.

02:03.715 --> 02:04.750
Hannah quit
while you were gone.

02:04.783 --> 02:07.688
I guess she memo-ed to file
some complaints she had

02:07.722 --> 02:08.924
about being a working mother.

02:08.957 --> 02:10.729
And so you might also
have to be deposed.

02:10.762 --> 02:11.731
Blah, blah,
blah, blah,

02:11.764 --> 02:12.932
blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

02:12.965 --> 02:13.934
Relax.
Okay.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.036
Just relax.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.307
Okay, I'll get
to all of it later.

02:16.341 --> 02:17.443
It's kinda serious.

02:17.475 --> 02:19.447
Aren't you gonna ask me
how Jamaica was?

02:19.479 --> 02:21.384
[whispers]
Say it. Ask me.

02:21.416 --> 02:23.321
How was Jamaica?

02:23.355 --> 02:25.325
It was so good.
Oh!

02:25.359 --> 02:27.796
Hey, mon!

02:27.829 --> 02:29.432
At Sandals Jamaica,

02:29.467 --> 02:31.636
when somebody says,
"Hey, mon," everybody says,

02:31.671 --> 02:32.806
"Hey, mon," back.

02:32.839 --> 02:34.377
(Stanley)
Oh, Michael,

02:34.410 --> 02:35.544
I'm glad you're here.

02:35.579 --> 02:36.914
Stanley, you know what?

02:36.947 --> 02:38.717
It is really good
to see you too.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.621
My bonus check
was $100 less

02:40.654 --> 02:41.623
than you promised.

02:41.656 --> 02:43.694
Okay, well, payroll
is in charge of all of that.

02:43.727 --> 02:44.830
They said I should
talk to you.

02:44.863 --> 02:46.666
Well, I am just
getting settled in.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.936
So I'm gonna...

02:47.969 --> 02:50.975
I am not doin' a lick more work
until I get my full bonus check.

02:51.009 --> 02:54.115
You are not as much fun
as your Jamaican brothers.

02:54.147 --> 02:56.554
Mon.

02:57.856 --> 03:00.092
Do you wanna talk
about it?

03:00.127 --> 03:01.363
Nope.

03:04.469 --> 03:06.507
I still haven't
found an apartment yet.

03:06.540 --> 03:07.975
I'm living in a hotel.

03:08.009 --> 03:09.880
Yesterday
I saw a "For Rent" sign

03:09.912 --> 03:11.048
down the street from Jim,

03:11.081 --> 03:13.955
and he said he didn't think
it'd be such a good idea.

03:13.987 --> 03:16.927
He said it would be
like we were living together.

03:16.961 --> 03:18.830
In different houses.

03:18.864 --> 03:20.000
Two blocks away.

03:20.032 --> 03:21.571
(Michael)
* Feelin'

03:21.603 --> 03:24.174
* Hot, hot, hot
[playing steel drum ]

03:24.209 --> 03:27.848
* Feelin' hot, hot, hot

03:27.882 --> 03:30.722
* Feelin' hot, hot, hot

03:31.924 --> 03:34.195
* Feelin' hot, hot, hot

03:34.228 --> 03:36.199
That's all I know so far,
but I'm gonna keep practicing.

03:36.232 --> 03:37.201
That's good.

03:37.234 --> 03:39.071
[playing steel drum]

03:39.105 --> 03:41.042
You know, I had never been out
of the country before now?

03:41.075 --> 03:42.077
Oh.

03:42.111 --> 03:43.948
Got to see
how Jamaicans live.

03:43.981 --> 03:45.050
It is great, you know.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.052
They just relax.

03:46.085 --> 03:47.221
They party all the time.

03:47.254 --> 03:49.225
It's kind
of an impoverished country.

03:49.258 --> 03:51.095
Yeah. Gosh...

03:51.129 --> 03:52.097
Great.

03:52.131 --> 03:53.033
You know what, Pam?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.737
Make a note.

03:54.769 --> 03:58.043
I want us all to start
having piÃ±a coladas

03:58.076 --> 03:59.246
every day at 3:00.

03:59.278 --> 04:00.481
Well, you can't today.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.016
We're doing inventory.

04:02.051 --> 04:03.621
Inventory's at the end
of December.

04:03.654 --> 04:05.559
We couldn't do it without you,
so we postponed.

04:05.591 --> 04:08.095
Oh...I specifically
went on vacation

04:08.129 --> 04:09.231
so I would miss it.

04:09.265 --> 04:11.069
Inventory is boring.

04:11.101 --> 04:13.307
In the islands,
they don't make you do stuff,

04:13.340 --> 04:15.611
like take inventory.

04:15.644 --> 04:18.249
Why do you think so many
businesses move to the Caymans?

04:18.283 --> 04:22.057
Tonight, we are going to have
an inventory luau.

04:22.091 --> 04:24.862
I want to bring back
a little slice of paradise

04:24.897 --> 04:27.769
to the Dunder-Mifflin
warehouse inventory.

04:27.802 --> 04:29.339
So, party planning committee,
get on it.

04:29.371 --> 04:31.042
By the end of the day?

04:31.075 --> 04:32.713
That's impossible.

04:32.746 --> 04:35.283
The Jamaicans don't have a word
for "impossible."

04:35.318 --> 04:37.087
Yep, it's English.
It's impossible.

04:37.121 --> 04:38.324
Michael,
there's no way

04:38.356 --> 04:39.693
we can do it in time.

04:39.727 --> 04:41.162
How hard is a luau?

04:41.195 --> 04:44.235
All you need are some
grass skirts, pineapple, poi,

04:44.268 --> 04:46.674
tiki torches, suckling pig.

04:46.707 --> 04:48.176
Some fire dancers.

04:50.313 --> 04:51.883
That's all you need.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.956
Come on in.

04:54.989 --> 04:56.325
Settle in.

04:57.895 --> 04:59.800
Settling.

04:59.832 --> 05:00.601
Settling.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.106
And...settled, good.

05:03.138 --> 05:04.274
There is something

05:04.309 --> 05:06.145
I would like to
show everybody.

05:06.179 --> 05:06.947
See this sign?

05:06.981 --> 05:09.819
"No shirt, no shoes,
no problem."

05:09.853 --> 05:11.857
This is an attitude

05:11.890 --> 05:14.697
I would like all of you
to have right here.

05:14.729 --> 05:17.201
So what if we have to stay late
and do inventory.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.171
No problem.

05:19.205 --> 05:22.177
Oh, my God.
Is that Jan?
What?

05:22.211 --> 05:23.380
(Dwight)
Where?
(Pam)
On the left.

05:23.413 --> 05:24.683
Oh, Yeah.

05:24.717 --> 05:25.952
Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no.

05:25.984 --> 05:29.290
No. That's a German woman
named Urkel Grue.

05:29.325 --> 05:33.166
Jan told me to play it cool
and not tell anybody

05:33.199 --> 05:35.805
because it could
get us both in trouble.

05:35.839 --> 05:39.679
So, officially,
I did not see her.

05:41.916 --> 05:44.188
But I did see Jan there.

05:44.221 --> 05:47.093
In our room.

05:47.126 --> 05:49.231
At night.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.068
And in the morning.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.405
And that's all I'm gonna say.

05:54.877 --> 05:56.245
Except...

05:56.279 --> 05:58.516
sex.

05:58.549 --> 05:59.853
We had sex.

05:59.887 --> 06:02.191
[chuckles]

06:02.224 --> 06:05.162
I had sex with her.

06:05.196 --> 06:06.833
I had sex with Jan.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.405
Hey, dude.
Just got back from Jamaica.

06:09.438 --> 06:11.543
(man on speakerphone)
Big whoop.
I was in Hotlanta.

06:11.576 --> 06:13.446
That whole town is whack.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.985
Yeah, that sounds amazing,
but you know what?

06:16.018 --> 06:19.492
The lady, Jan Levinson,
wanted to go to Montego Bay.

06:19.525 --> 06:21.563
You took
the Ice Queen?

06:21.595 --> 06:23.366
[chuckles]
I don't buy it.

06:23.399 --> 06:26.573
Well, I'm looking at a photo
right now,

06:26.605 --> 06:30.380
and I'm tellin' ya,
it could be in Maxim.

06:30.413 --> 06:33.085
They wouldn't give you
a subscription to Maxim.

06:33.118 --> 06:34.388
Oh, no?
No

06:34.422 --> 06:35.390
Okay.

06:35.424 --> 06:38.195
Well...

06:38.228 --> 06:39.230
[sighs]

06:39.264 --> 06:41.335
Check this out.

06:41.369 --> 06:45.310
I'm sending you
some e-mail.

06:45.343 --> 06:46.413
[man sighs]

06:46.446 --> 06:47.515
You got it?

06:47.547 --> 06:50.252
What? No.
I got nothin'.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.324
Check it again.
Hit "refresh."

06:52.357 --> 06:55.363
Yeah, Mike,
still nothin'.

06:55.397 --> 06:56.332
Okay, wait a second.

06:56.365 --> 07:03.179
I sent it to you
at packer@dunder-mifflin.com

07:03.213 --> 07:06.284
Packaging
at Dunder-Mifflin...

07:06.318 --> 07:07.221
Uh-oh.

07:07.254 --> 07:11.562
Wait. I just got it
from somebody else.

07:11.596 --> 07:14.201
Wow, this is hot.

07:14.235 --> 07:15.537
Damn!

07:15.570 --> 07:18.576
How do I get you
out of this picture?

07:25.057 --> 07:26.392
(Michael)
Ahh...

07:26.425 --> 07:27.594
Darryl!

07:28.998 --> 07:30.400
Hey, hi.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.402
Where's Darryl?

07:31.435 --> 07:32.939
He's, uh,
in the office.

07:32.973 --> 07:35.077
Okay. Hi.

07:35.110 --> 07:37.213
Hey, man,
How's it goin'?

07:37.246 --> 07:38.550
All right.
what's up, Mike?

07:38.584 --> 07:41.022
That's great.
Okay, um.

07:41.055 --> 07:43.126
So did you get an email
from me?

07:43.158 --> 07:44.327
Yeah.
Okay.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.069
Well, that was supposed to
go to Packer,

07:48.103 --> 07:49.038
not "packaging."

07:49.071 --> 07:50.140
Hmm.

07:50.172 --> 07:53.981
Did you already forward it
to a whole bunch of people?

07:54.015 --> 07:55.017
Uh-huh.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.987
Okay. Um...

07:57.021 --> 08:00.093
Well, did you get
the second email that I sent,

08:00.127 --> 08:00.961
explaining that the first email
was a mistake

08:00.961 --> 08:03.033
and that you should delete it.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.301
Yep.

08:04.335 --> 08:06.105
And you sent that out
to everyone?

08:06.138 --> 08:09.410
Mike, I'm very busy
down here.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.315
Yikes.

08:11.349 --> 08:13.252
Already sent it
to you, my friend.

08:13.286 --> 08:14.388
Fantastic.

08:14.420 --> 08:15.422
Boring.

08:15.457 --> 08:17.662
Call me
if she rolls over.

08:18.763 --> 08:19.799
Hey.

08:19.831 --> 08:21.134
Hey.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.807
You okay?

08:23.839 --> 08:24.809
Yeah.

08:24.841 --> 08:27.081
[coffee pouring]

08:27.114 --> 08:28.783
[sets pot down]

08:28.817 --> 08:29.819
You sure?

08:29.851 --> 08:32.223
Yeah.

08:32.257 --> 08:34.061
Yes.

08:36.331 --> 08:41.474
I'm just in this, like,
stupid fight with Karen.

08:41.508 --> 08:43.079
Oh.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.221
You want to talk about it?

08:49.125 --> 08:49.891
Really?

08:53.734 --> 08:56.471
I have a special assignment
for you.

08:56.504 --> 08:58.176
Who's the target?

08:58.209 --> 09:02.585
A sensitive email has been
released to the office.

09:02.617 --> 09:04.888
It contains a file,

09:04.922 --> 09:07.161
a picture...

09:07.193 --> 09:10.132
the file name
is "Jamaica Jan Sun Princess."

09:10.167 --> 09:11.134
What's it of?

09:11.169 --> 09:12.404
Not important.

09:12.437 --> 09:13.907
Unless you're willing
to tell me everything,

09:13.940 --> 09:14.909
I cannot accept
this assignment.

09:14.942 --> 09:16.544
Okay, forget it.
Okay, I accept it.

09:16.580 --> 09:17.814
So, I don't know,

09:17.848 --> 09:19.619
I just feel like
we've been dating a month,

09:19.652 --> 09:20.921
right?

09:20.953 --> 09:23.159
Same street--I think
that might be a little close,

09:23.193 --> 09:23.860
a little bit much.

09:23.893 --> 09:26.933
Hmm.

09:26.965 --> 09:28.303
"Hmm," what?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.639
[scoffs]

09:29.672 --> 09:32.878
How far away does she live now,
like, ten minutes?

09:34.514 --> 09:37.187
[sighing]
Yeah, I guess.

09:37.221 --> 09:40.293
Honestly, I think you
should go easy on her.

09:41.696 --> 09:43.834
No, I didn't mind helping Jim
with his problem.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.504
That's what friends do.

09:46.538 --> 09:49.712
I...help Phyllis
all the time.

09:49.746 --> 09:53.820
Just yesterday I untangled
a piece of tape from her hair.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.960
So...yeah.

09:59.966 --> 10:00.968
Hey.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.807
Thanks a lot.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.547
Oh, don't worry about it.

10:07.581 --> 10:08.883
I mean, it's better

10:08.917 --> 10:11.555
than listening to Michael
play a conch shell,

10:11.589 --> 10:13.859
which is what I was doing.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.566
Oh, also,

10:17.601 --> 10:19.906
Michael went to Jamaica
with Jan.

10:19.938 --> 10:21.942
Yeah. How have we not talked
about this already?

10:21.976 --> 10:23.879
I mean,
what happened there?

10:23.914 --> 10:26.051
Kidnapping?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.990
(Toby)
Hey, I need to talk to you.

10:29.023 --> 10:30.025
Not now, not ever.

10:30.059 --> 10:31.562
About you and Jan.

10:31.594 --> 10:32.932
Ah, none of your business.

10:32.964 --> 10:36.372
Well, I wish that were true,
but it--it, um...

10:36.405 --> 10:37.875
it seems from that photo

10:37.908 --> 10:40.579
that you two--you've entered
into an intimate relationship.

10:40.612 --> 10:41.749
That photo
is my personal property.

10:41.783 --> 10:42.785
And if you are telling me

10:42.818 --> 10:44.989
that you went on my computer
and stole that photo,

10:45.021 --> 10:47.394
then I am going
to call the cops.

10:47.427 --> 10:49.899
Michael, nine different people
emailed me that photo,

10:49.932 --> 10:52.838
including my ex-wife,
and, well, we don't talk.

10:52.872 --> 10:55.944
Well, then this was probably
the ice-breaker you need.

10:55.978 --> 10:56.913
You know,
for your own protection,

10:56.946 --> 10:59.986
you should disclose
the relationship to H.R.

11:00.019 --> 11:02.523
I bet you would love
all the details, wouldn't you,

11:02.557 --> 11:03.993
skeevy little perv?

11:04.027 --> 11:05.964
All right, if you're
having a relationship

11:05.997 --> 11:07.767
with your superior,
you must disclose it.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.769
No, no.

11:08.803 --> 11:10.105
No, I am not dating Jan.

11:10.139 --> 11:12.644
She was very clear about that.

11:12.678 --> 11:15.783
Just two like souls
having a romantic time

11:15.818 --> 11:18.656
in the most romantic place
on earth.

11:18.689 --> 11:20.058
Got enough, weirdo?

11:20.092 --> 11:22.563
All right.
Thanks, Michael.
Okay.

11:22.597 --> 11:25.603
Okay, we only have 3 hours,
people, to plan a whole luau.

11:25.636 --> 11:27.173
And you're not helping.

11:27.205 --> 11:28.944
What are the ingredients
of poi?

11:28.977 --> 11:31.048
I called every grocery store
in Scranton,

11:31.080 --> 11:32.583
and no one sells whole pigs.

11:32.617 --> 11:34.119
Did you try the petting zoo?

11:36.993 --> 11:39.196
Dunder-Mifflin.
This is Pam.

11:39.229 --> 11:40.767
Just a second.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.003
Michael?

11:42.036 --> 11:43.673
It's Jan
on the phone for you.

11:43.706 --> 11:45.009
Oh, no, no, no.

11:45.042 --> 11:46.779
Hang up.
Hang up.

11:46.812 --> 11:48.048
Tell her
I'm not here.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.084
Don't.

11:49.117 --> 11:50.753
[whispering]
I've ran out of gas.

11:50.787 --> 11:51.855
Hit a deer.

11:51.889 --> 11:55.129
I hit a deer with my car.

11:55.161 --> 11:56.098
Tell her I hit a cat!

11:56.131 --> 11:57.200
Tell her I hit a cat.

11:57.232 --> 11:58.569
He'll call you back.

11:58.603 --> 12:01.441
Okay.
Great.

12:01.441 --> 12:03.012
Do you think she bought it?

12:03.045 --> 12:04.080
Okay.

12:05.082 --> 12:06.117
Okay.

12:08.288 --> 12:10.928
[whispering]
Michael hit a deer?

12:10.961 --> 12:14.099
Michael!

12:14.133 --> 12:16.038
Michael, there's an emergency
in the warehouse.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.507
An accident?
Is somebody hurt?

12:17.541 --> 12:20.212
No, it's...
involves a photograph.

12:20.245 --> 12:24.755
Oh, God, no!
No, no, no, no.

12:31.902 --> 12:33.271
[applause]

12:33.305 --> 12:35.076
Mike, you a rock star, man.

12:35.109 --> 12:37.213
You are the man!

12:37.245 --> 12:38.549
Yeah! Well done.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.318
All right, okay.

12:40.351 --> 12:43.158
That corporate booty,
he likes to hit it!

12:47.967 --> 12:51.208
Hello, hi,
attention, everyone.

12:51.241 --> 12:55.650
Um, apparently there is an email
circulating around

12:55.683 --> 12:58.021
that contains
a very PG-13 rated picture

12:58.055 --> 12:59.691
of me and a woman.

12:59.725 --> 13:00.693
Jan.

13:00.727 --> 13:02.831
No, Kevin, a woman!

13:02.865 --> 13:04.067
(Michael)
Maybe Jan, maybe--

13:04.099 --> 13:05.235
Urkel Grue.

13:05.269 --> 13:07.340
My point is that
if you get it,

13:07.372 --> 13:10.245
I would ask that you
just delete it, sight unseen.

13:10.278 --> 13:13.017

all right?

Hey.

13:19.264 --> 13:20.231
What are you doing
out here?

13:20.266 --> 13:22.203
Island living, you know.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.207
Jan called.

13:24.239 --> 13:26.278
She's coming in later
to talk to you.

13:26.310 --> 13:27.781
Did she say
what it's about?

13:27.814 --> 13:29.383
That's all she said.

13:57.173 --> 13:58.141
You sure?

13:58.175 --> 13:59.143
Definitely.

13:59.177 --> 14:01.113
* Dile hot hot hot

14:01.147 --> 14:03.252
I have disconnected
the office T1 line.

14:03.285 --> 14:05.789
I've ordered that that
be taken down.

14:05.823 --> 14:08.062
And I destroyed all print outs
from the bathroom.

14:08.095 --> 14:10.032
There were copies
in the bathroom?

14:10.066 --> 14:12.070
There were.
A lot of them.

14:12.103 --> 14:14.775
All right.

14:20.252 --> 14:21.388
I think I owe you one.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.392
Sorry?

14:23.424 --> 14:25.096
For talking sense
into Halpert.

14:25.128 --> 14:26.900
The Day's Inn room 228
was starting

14:26.932 --> 14:28.201
to get really depressing.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.938
Oh, yeah, no,
don't worry about it.

14:29.972 --> 14:32.075
I mean,
he was being ridiculous.

14:32.110 --> 14:33.278
Yeah.

14:33.312 --> 14:35.181
But thanks,
seriously.

14:46.404 --> 14:47.807
I knew he'd turn up.

14:47.841 --> 14:50.145
You see that?

14:50.178 --> 14:52.350
This is the greatest night
of my life.

What?

No, it's not...

15:11.321 --> 15:12.455
It's nothing.

15:22.911 --> 15:25.382
It's hot in here.

15:25.416 --> 15:26.351
Yeah.

Yeah.

[sniffling]

15:36.670 --> 15:39.144

You don't need
to stay here.

Hello, everyone.

Hello, Michael.

[muffled]
Hello.

16:34.319 --> 16:35.522
Hi, Jan.

16:35.556 --> 16:38.195
You look...tan.

16:38.227 --> 16:42.203
I was in Scottsdale
visiting my sister.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.040
Yeah?

16:44.074 --> 16:46.278
How was it?

16:46.310 --> 16:48.447
Very sunny.

16:48.481 --> 16:49.550
Family's important.

16:49.584 --> 16:54.259
Michael, I would like to speak
with you in your office.

16:54.294 --> 16:55.428
Okay, yep.
Please.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.537
Why am I here, Michael?

17:33.571 --> 17:35.408
Uh...

17:35.441 --> 17:37.380
In the last year I've gone
through a divorce,

17:37.412 --> 17:40.451
an identity theft,
a husband who would not...

17:40.485 --> 17:43.392
communicate.

17:43.424 --> 17:44.459
This is neither here
nor there.

17:44.493 --> 17:45.896
My psychiatrist thinks
that I have

17:45.928 --> 17:47.700
some self-destructive
tendencies.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.339
And that for once,
I should indulge them.

17:50.371 --> 17:51.641
You following me?

17:51.674 --> 17:54.214
Uh, uh, yes.

17:54.247 --> 17:57.320
I think I owe it
to myself

17:57.353 --> 17:59.657
to find some kind
of happiness.

17:59.690 --> 18:03.431
You know, I mean,
even if it means

18:03.465 --> 18:07.540
lowering my expectations
or redefining the word itself.

18:07.573 --> 18:08.774
Okay, yeah.

18:08.808 --> 18:10.445
This is the thing,
you know.

18:10.479 --> 18:13.685
I am attracted to you.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.888
I-I don't know why I...

18:15.922 --> 18:16.991
[sighing]

18:17.024 --> 18:18.827
But I am.

18:18.862 --> 18:21.900
And...I need to follow
my instincts.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.673
At least, that's
what Dr. Perry thinks.

18:24.707 --> 18:26.843
Who's Dr. Perry?

18:26.878 --> 18:29.483
This is the point, okay?

18:29.517 --> 18:30.586
You're wrong for me.

18:30.618 --> 18:32.555
Okay.

18:32.590 --> 18:35.595
In...in every way.

18:35.628 --> 18:38.435
Well, not--

18:38.467 --> 18:42.675
But I still find myself
wanting to...

18:45.046 --> 18:48.687
be with you.

18:48.721 --> 18:52.562
And I, to you,

18:52.595 --> 18:55.469
in addition, feel

18:55.501 --> 18:59.676
the same feelings
that you are as well.

Good, good.

So, um, thanks
for coming by.

19:16.544 --> 19:17.713
So, I, uh...

19:17.745 --> 19:18.714
No, good.

19:18.747 --> 19:19.716
Okay.

19:19.749 --> 19:21.354
Okay.

19:21.388 --> 19:23.925
Thank you for taking
the time.

19:23.957 --> 19:25.761
Well, thanks
for coming over, I appre--

19:25.795 --> 19:27.332
Mm.

19:31.473 --> 19:34.447
Wait 15 minutes,
find an excuse,

19:34.480 --> 19:35.581
and meet me
at your condo.

19:35.616 --> 19:39.723
Okay.

19:39.756 --> 19:42.695
Jan.

19:42.729 --> 19:45.636
You complete me.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.148
Oh, God.

19:58.462 --> 20:00.599
Hey.

20:00.631 --> 20:03.572
Remember when we were planning
our honeymoon,

20:03.604 --> 20:05.976
and you wanted to go
to Hawaii,

20:06.009 --> 20:08.482
and I wanted to go
to Mexico?

20:08.514 --> 20:10.451
Yeah.

20:10.486 --> 20:13.957
I was definitely right.

20:13.992 --> 20:15.160
* Yeah

20:15.193 --> 20:16.731
* So we go
room boom boom boom *

20:16.764 --> 20:19.970

20:20.004 --> 20:22.207
Oh, brother.

20:22.242 --> 20:23.478
What am I gonna do?

20:23.512 --> 20:27.083
I'm gonna hang it up
at home.

20:27.118 --> 20:29.188
I don't have a lot
of art.
