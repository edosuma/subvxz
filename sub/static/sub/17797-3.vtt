00:07.081 --> 00:08.750
<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:08.751 --> 00:10.521
<i>Those of you who knew
my dad will-will know</i>

00:10.522 --> 00:12.925
<i>that we didn't always get along so well,</i>

00:12.926 --> 00:15.531
but I-I loved him.

00:15.532 --> 00:17.801
- That was a lovely service.
- You're coming back

00:17.802 --> 00:19.471
to the house though, aren't you?

00:19.472 --> 00:21.008
I don't know.

00:21.009 --> 00:23.547
Do you think we should
come back to the house?

00:23.548 --> 00:25.851
Only if you want to.

00:25.852 --> 00:28.557
How was teaching this week?
You have any fun?

00:28.558 --> 00:30.459
Not really.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.296
I thought it was really elegant, Audrey.

00:33.968 --> 00:37.575
I thought it was very dull,
unless it was supposed to be a satire.

00:37.576 --> 00:40.212
Was it?

00:40.213 --> 00:43.018
Hello. You just
popped up out of nowhere.

00:43.019 --> 00:44.689
<i>Bienvenue, Monsieur Solloway.</i>

00:44.690 --> 00:46.526
<i>Je suis Professeur Le Gall.</i>

00:46.527 --> 00:48.930
I'm just so pleased to finally meet you.

00:48.931 --> 00:51.335
I feel that you and I
are kindred spirits.

00:51.336 --> 00:53.439
- Silence is violence!
- Silence is violence!

00:53.440 --> 00:56.278
- Was there a rape?
- I'm not sure.

00:56.279 --> 00:58.349
I thought I'd come to America

00:58.350 --> 01:01.321
and have a grand adventure,
and instead it's...

01:01.322 --> 01:02.792
Instead, it's New Jersey.

01:05.297 --> 01:06.866
Noah, are you all right?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.670
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:08.671 --> 01:11.475
Officer Santos, who knows I'm here?

01:11.476 --> 01:13.212
What do you mean?

01:13.213 --> 01:15.182
<i>I'm just wondering
if it's possible</i>

01:15.183 --> 01:17.554
<i>for anybody still inside Fishkill</i>

01:17.555 --> 01:20.594
<i>to find out my current address.</i>

01:20.595 --> 01:23.032
<i>Why are you asking, Solloway?</i>

01:23.033 --> 01:25.202
<i>Never mind.
It's... it's not important.</i>

01:25.203 --> 01:27.207
Aah!

03:59.579 --> 04:01.716
It's a lovely day, Professor.

04:01.717 --> 04:03.553
Do you have anything planned?

04:03.554 --> 04:05.991
Just preparing dinner for
a few people tonight.

04:05.992 --> 04:09.732
Coq au vin?

04:09.733 --> 04:11.167
We shall see.

04:24.763 --> 04:27.333
Professor Le Gall? We
don't want to bother you.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.437
We just wanted to say that
we're loving your class.

04:29.438 --> 04:32.511
Yeah. I thought medieval French
literature was gonna be boring,

04:32.512 --> 04:34.280
but you're not boring at all.

04:34.281 --> 04:36.384
Well, thank you.

04:36.385 --> 04:39.591
I believe love is never
boring, even 900 years ago.

04:39.592 --> 04:41.094
What are you reading, Professor?

04:41.095 --> 04:44.802
This I'm afraid is very boring.

04:44.803 --> 04:46.806
Andreas Capellanus.

04:46.807 --> 04:48.442
It's part of my research.

04:48.443 --> 04:49.812
Are you enjoying your time here?

04:49.813 --> 04:52.584
Are you glad you came?

04:52.585 --> 04:56.124
It's very exciting to be in America.

04:57.795 --> 04:59.832
<i>"Lancelot, ou le Chevalier
de la Charrette."</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:01.067
Come prepared with questions.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.039
- Okay.
- Of course. Bye.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.904
<i>Speaking French.</i>

09:09.130 --> 09:11.902
How can you possibly
call this an ambiguous case?

09:11.903 --> 09:14.440
She got into bed
with him of her own accord.

09:14.441 --> 09:16.077
It doesn't matter.

09:16.078 --> 09:18.682
She did not want to give
Nicholas Perry a blowjob.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.953
Are you saying that you're
okay with forcing a woman

09:20.954 --> 09:23.257
against her will to give you a blowjob?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.362
For fuck's sake, Audrey. Of
course I'm not saying that,

09:25.363 --> 09:28.434
but this specific lady
gave no indication

09:28.435 --> 09:30.338
that she didn't want
what he was giving her.

09:30.339 --> 09:31.875
I'm sorry, Mike. Were you there?

09:31.876 --> 09:34.981
She admits it herself. She does.

09:34.982 --> 09:37.152
She admits she swallowed.

09:37.153 --> 09:39.323
What? Come on.

09:39.324 --> 09:41.327
Grow up. Could we not just at least

09:41.328 --> 09:43.732
maybe... maybe consider the idea

09:43.733 --> 09:45.201
that she was on board here?

09:45.202 --> 09:47.172
Mike, every two minutes

09:47.173 --> 09:50.145
someone is sexually
assaulted in our country.

09:50.146 --> 09:52.049
Do you know how often the
perpetrator is punished?

09:52.050 --> 09:53.686
- Less than one percent.
- Thanks.

09:53.687 --> 09:55.890
Thank you. Yes.
And do you know why?

09:55.891 --> 09:57.927
Because it's because of
this exact conversation,

09:57.928 --> 09:59.531
because we don't believe our victims.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.367
We make them feel like
they asked for it.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.237
Okay. I'm just
trying to have a dialogue,

10:03.238 --> 10:04.607
but if you're just gonna recite

10:04.608 --> 10:06.343
a Planned Parenthood pamphlet at me...

10:06.344 --> 10:07.780
My God. What's the point to it?

10:07.781 --> 10:09.283
I can't believe I ever slept with you.

10:09.284 --> 10:12.422
Okay, all right.

10:12.423 --> 10:15.863
So that's what this little
tirade is really about, right?

10:15.864 --> 10:18.134
Right, Audrey? Admit it.

10:18.135 --> 10:20.773
What I will admit, Cornwall,
is that I wanted to fuck you

10:20.774 --> 10:23.612
at the time, and I regretted it after,

10:23.613 --> 10:26.117
but because I'm a cognizant human being

10:26.118 --> 10:29.557
who is able to determine and
articulate my own desire,

10:29.558 --> 10:31.260
I did not bring rape
charges against you,

10:31.261 --> 10:34.099
even after I found out
what a giant turd you are.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.938
But if we had had sex against my will,

10:36.939 --> 10:38.474
that would have been different.

10:38.475 --> 10:40.980
Do you understand that distinction?

10:40.981 --> 10:43.484
Yes. I understand the distinction.

10:43.485 --> 10:45.823
Do you think I'm capable of
understanding that distinction?

10:45.824 --> 10:50.198
Frankly, right now I'm just
terrified of you, Audrey.

10:50.199 --> 10:52.002
My God. You're a fucking dick.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.039
Whoa! Come on. It's the coq au vin.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.709
I'm sorry, Professor. I'm sorry.

10:55.710 --> 10:58.615
I just... he's... I-I can't. I can't...

10:58.616 --> 11:01.755
please tell me it's not
like this in France.

11:01.756 --> 11:03.457
It's not at all like this in France.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.761
It's much worse.

11:04.762 --> 11:06.598
- What?
- Yes.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.637
I'm afraid the whole topic is
still not taken seriously.

11:09.638 --> 11:11.073
<i>Oui? C'est bon.</i>

11:11.074 --> 11:12.944
You're very lucky to be surrounded

11:12.945 --> 11:16.283
by such enlightened chaps
such as myself and Blake.

11:16.284 --> 11:17.620
Professor.

11:17.621 --> 11:19.156
It's curious, though.

11:19.157 --> 11:22.462
In this case, the two parties
agree on what happened.

11:22.463 --> 11:25.970
She gave him a blowjob.
He didn't force her to.

11:25.971 --> 11:28.207
- No, he didn't.
- But they don't agree

11:28.208 --> 11:29.644
on the meaning of the act.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.846
He said she wanted to.

11:30.847 --> 11:32.683
She said she didn't.

11:32.684 --> 11:34.453
Is that right?

11:34.454 --> 11:37.158
- She didn't consent.
- But he didn't force her.

11:37.159 --> 11:39.030
- No.
- But she didn't consent.

11:41.669 --> 11:44.006
That's very confusing, isn't it?

11:44.007 --> 11:46.243
- No. Not to me.
- Yes.

11:46.244 --> 11:50.385
I see that it's quite clear to you.

11:50.386 --> 11:52.556
But I live some decades now,

11:52.557 --> 11:55.261
and there's a lot

11:55.262 --> 11:58.067
about what I want that
I don't understand

11:58.068 --> 12:02.475
and that I don't expect
a lover to understand.

12:02.476 --> 12:04.379
Professor Le Gall, please tell me

12:04.380 --> 12:05.849
that you see the problem here.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.720
I see problems, I do.

12:07.721 --> 12:11.160
But I think we all live in our
own version of the truth,

12:11.161 --> 12:13.999
and thus we are prone to
terrible miscommunications.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.172
Perhaps she was trying to
communicate one thing,

12:17.173 --> 12:18.508
and he read something else.

12:18.509 --> 12:20.846
That's possible, isn't it?

12:20.847 --> 12:22.482
Yes. Of course it's possible.

12:22.483 --> 12:24.854
That's why the university
needs to establish

12:24.855 --> 12:28.260
and enforce a mandate of verbal consent.

12:28.261 --> 12:31.568
I understand how such a thing
would protect the university,

12:31.569 --> 12:35.909
but I don't see how sex
itself would survive.

12:35.910 --> 12:38.047
Why not?

12:38.048 --> 12:39.851
Because I am afraid the articulate

12:39.852 --> 12:43.090
is the enemy of the erotic.

12:43.091 --> 12:44.694
Isn't the whole point
that you don't know

12:44.695 --> 12:47.198
what your lover will do next?

12:47.199 --> 12:51.106
That you give yourself over
to a sensory experience

12:51.107 --> 12:55.983
that you haven't planned
and can't control?

12:55.984 --> 12:58.722
The reason I like sex
is that I can finally,

12:58.723 --> 13:00.759
for a moment,

13:00.760 --> 13:03.397
turn off my neurotic mind

13:03.398 --> 13:06.738
and just be consumed.

13:06.739 --> 13:09.342
If I give my lover permission... yes,

13:09.343 --> 13:12.348
no, touch me,

13:12.349 --> 13:15.722
not there... don't I undermine

13:15.723 --> 13:18.595
the potency of his desire?

13:22.537 --> 13:25.074
I'm sorry. You're all looking
at me like I'm crazy.

13:25.075 --> 13:26.578
Do I sound crazy?

13:26.579 --> 13:28.583
No.

13:34.293 --> 13:38.602
Well, Professor Le
Gall is a love expert.

13:38.603 --> 13:41.140
Professor Le Gall is a
courtly love expert.

13:41.141 --> 13:42.610
What's your point?

13:42.611 --> 13:44.079
Besides the
fact that this manner

13:44.080 --> 13:46.651
of thinking has been out
of date for 600 years,

13:46.652 --> 13:48.287
was written entirely by men

13:48.288 --> 13:51.026
wherein the women served as
the object of male desire,

13:51.027 --> 13:53.097
but had no voice of her own.

13:53.098 --> 13:57.973
So perhaps we can forgive
Professor Le Gall for assuming

13:57.974 --> 14:00.512
that the articulation of female desire

14:00.513 --> 14:04.085
is somehow anathema to
sexual satisfaction.

14:04.086 --> 14:07.425
But with all due respect,
Professor, I would argue

14:07.426 --> 14:09.764
that she simply never learned
the appropriate language,

14:09.765 --> 14:12.603
because I can tell you exactly
how I want you to fuck me.

14:12.604 --> 14:14.807
- Believe me, I remember.
- And Lila can tell you

14:14.808 --> 14:16.978
exactly how she wants you to fuck her.

14:16.979 --> 14:18.447
Hard.

14:18.448 --> 14:19.951
And if you give me 45 minutes,

14:19.952 --> 14:21.521
I can teach Professor Le Gall

14:21.522 --> 14:23.290
to tell you exactly how she
would like you to fuck her,

14:23.291 --> 14:25.127
though you would not be
given the opportunity

14:25.128 --> 14:26.698
in a million years.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.102
Forgive me.

14:29.103 --> 14:31.508
I think I hear the soufflé falling.

14:53.084 --> 14:56.390
- I have to have you right now.
- Mike, no.

14:56.391 --> 14:58.561
<i>Speaking French - No, no, no.</i>

14:58.562 --> 15:00.231
- No, no.
- Anybody could walk in.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.968
Who gives a fuck? Come on.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.838
No. Mike, no.

15:03.839 --> 15:08.848
Professor... I'm so sorry.

15:08.849 --> 15:10.284
I didn't mean to offend you.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.521
You... you didn't.

15:11.522 --> 15:13.157
Yes, I did. Of course I did.

15:13.158 --> 15:15.629
I behaved like a total asshole.

15:15.630 --> 15:20.204
I just... it's Noah Solloway.

15:20.205 --> 15:22.241
He just makes me so agitated.

15:22.242 --> 15:23.912
I mean, I didn't know
he was gonna be here.

15:23.913 --> 15:27.519
I mean, why did you invite him?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.489
We bumped into each other on the quad,

15:29.490 --> 15:31.026
and he seemed rather lonely, so...

15:31.027 --> 15:33.431
I'm taking his class.
Did I tell you that?

15:35.235 --> 15:37.004
- You didn't.
- Well, I am,

15:37.005 --> 15:38.908
and he's a complete dick.

15:38.909 --> 15:40.545
I mean an utter asshole,

15:40.546 --> 15:45.555
and all I can do is think
about fucking him.

15:45.556 --> 15:47.693
So do it.

15:47.694 --> 15:50.532
Seriously, Audrey. What's stopping you?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.603
- Jesus!
- That he's your professor?

15:52.604 --> 15:54.774
That he's twice your age?

15:54.775 --> 15:57.378
That he's an ex-felon?
But you're so liberated.

15:57.379 --> 16:00.317
My God, Mike, why are
you so obsessed with me?

16:00.318 --> 16:02.523
- Obsessed with you?
- Yes.

16:02.524 --> 16:05.595
I'm trying to have a private
conversation with my professor.

16:05.596 --> 16:07.265
Do you mind?

16:07.266 --> 16:10.070
Yeah, I do mind, Audrey,
because I was here first.

16:10.071 --> 16:12.609
Today romantic love has
replaced Christianity

16:12.610 --> 16:16.416
as a doctrine for enforcing
the ideal of monogamy,

16:16.417 --> 16:18.888
and the French realize
all this is unrealistic.

16:18.889 --> 16:20.692
What happened to Noah? Did he leave?

16:20.693 --> 16:23.565
No. He went upstairs. He
said he wasn't feeling well.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.100
Lila, tell me you agree with me.

16:25.101 --> 16:26.637
The French recognize
marriage for what it is:

16:26.638 --> 16:28.741
A social construct created
to protect property.

16:28.742 --> 16:31.581
I agree with that...
with that one statement

16:31.582 --> 16:32.749
out of everything you said tonight.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.219
Just don't be that happy.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.980
You... you like... you
just like disagreeing.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.738
Hi.

16:43.739 --> 16:46.677
Hello.

16:46.678 --> 16:48.781
I was... I was looking for a quiet space.

16:48.782 --> 16:50.417
I hope you don't mind.

16:50.418 --> 16:52.421
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

16:52.422 --> 16:55.762
I haven't been around that
many people in a long time.

16:55.763 --> 16:58.033
Takes some getting used to again.

17:00.005 --> 17:02.709
Are they always like that?

17:02.710 --> 17:06.383
The students? You tell me.

17:06.384 --> 17:07.886
It's your country.

17:07.887 --> 17:09.824
I am just a visiting professor.

17:12.329 --> 17:16.505
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

17:18.407 --> 17:20.779
I'm here because the library claims

17:20.780 --> 17:22.983
to have unearthed certain pages

17:22.983 --> 17:24.285
from a rare manuscript

17:24.286 --> 17:26.455
that I happen to be an expert on.

17:26.457 --> 17:29.262
Really? What is it?

17:29.263 --> 17:31.466
<i>Les Esches d'Amour.</i>

17:31.467 --> 17:33.270
<i>The Chess of Love.</i>

17:33.271 --> 17:35.775
It was written in the 14th century.

17:35.776 --> 17:38.848
And this library thinks they
have some missing pages.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.787
Do they?

17:41.788 --> 17:44.025
I'm not sure yet, but if
I had to wager a guess,

17:44.026 --> 17:46.464
I'd say no.

17:51.340 --> 17:53.678
How long have they got you for?

17:53.679 --> 17:57.318
I'll teach until the
end of the semester.

17:57.319 --> 17:59.524
I've promised my husband
I'd be home for Christmas.

18:02.830 --> 18:06.637
- Long time to be away.
- Yes, but they gave me

18:06.638 --> 18:08.273
this generous residency,

18:08.274 --> 18:11.981
and this house, and the
cutest little red car.

18:11.982 --> 18:13.986
I love that car.

18:17.392 --> 18:20.965
Is this your...

18:20.966 --> 18:22.034
Yes.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.538
<i>C'est Etienne.</i>

18:23.539 --> 18:26.176
With my daughter,
Sabine, many years ago.

18:26.177 --> 18:29.917
She's all grown up now.

18:29.918 --> 18:32.321
She a medievalist, like her mom?

18:32.322 --> 18:36.096
No, but my husband is.

18:36.097 --> 18:38.601
A very famous one.

18:38.602 --> 18:41.439
A famous medievalist?

18:41.440 --> 18:44.446
Yes. In certain circles.

18:49.089 --> 18:51.193
That's how we met. I was his student.

18:57.774 --> 19:02.516
Do you think it's true what
Audrey was saying downstairs?

19:02.517 --> 19:06.489
What was Audrey saying?

19:06.490 --> 19:09.495
That she knows exactly what
she wants from her body.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.534
From men.

19:11.535 --> 19:14.405
From everything.

19:19.416 --> 19:22.422
I think Audrey is...

19:25.896 --> 19:28.901
I think Audrey is very young.

19:28.902 --> 19:32.474
Yes.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.414
But I don't ever remember
feeling that confident,

19:35.415 --> 19:39.923
even when I was her age.

19:39.924 --> 19:43.598
Maybe she really does know
exactly what she wants.

19:43.599 --> 19:47.271
Maybe this younger generation

19:47.272 --> 19:49.911
simply understands themselves better.

19:54.654 --> 19:58.594
Maybe the uncertainty
that I've always assumed

19:58.595 --> 20:03.370
is integral to eroticism...

20:03.371 --> 20:06.042
doesn't exist for them.

20:09.984 --> 20:13.624
Are you asking me if I
think the kids downstairs

20:13.625 --> 20:16.296
are having better sex than you or I?

20:27.218 --> 20:28.755
Do you?

20:31.895 --> 20:33.229
No.

20:40.078 --> 20:42.582
But they may be having more of it.

21:08.167 --> 21:11.005
- I'd... I'd better go.
- No! Stay. What?

21:11.006 --> 21:14.378
No, no. I-I'm sorry.
I'll let myself out.

21:39.630 --> 21:42.468
Where were you, Julie?

21:42.469 --> 21:45.241
I still don't know what to
do about Noah Solloway.

21:47.078 --> 21:49.348
I'm just gonna fuck him
and get it over with,

21:49.349 --> 21:53.022
and then I'll stop thinking about him.

21:53.023 --> 21:54.860
But if you sleep with him,
you'll never actually know

21:54.861 --> 21:56.497
what he thinks of your work.

21:57.967 --> 21:59.302
Fuck.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.970
Fuck.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.654
<i>Both speaking French.</i>

26:19.957 --> 26:21.458
Yeah, of course.

26:21.459 --> 26:23.196
- Okay.
- Yeah.

26:45.608 --> 26:47.444
Noah?

26:49.950 --> 26:52.087
Noah?

26:58.300 --> 27:00.771
Noah?

27:04.412 --> 27:06.148
Noah?

27:06.149 --> 27:07.417
<i>Speaking French</i>

27:23.216 --> 27:25.453
<i>murmuring in French</i>

27:25.454 --> 27:28.292
Noah, I'm here.

27:30.799 --> 27:32.768
Any medical history?
Any allergies?

27:32.769 --> 27:34.939
- No. I don't know.
- Is he taking any medication?

27:34.940 --> 27:37.377
I don't know. I'm not his wife.

28:41.540 --> 28:44.144
<i>- Hello.
- Sabine?</i>

28:44.145 --> 28:46.716
<i>Oui, ma cherie.</i>

28:50.792 --> 28:52.962
<i>Mon amour.</i>

29:26.730 --> 29:29.903
<i>Noah! Noah!</i>

29:31.305 --> 29:34.745
Noah! Noah!

29:34.746 --> 29:36.983
Hey. Come on.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.487
Come on.

29:39.488 --> 29:42.594
Stay with me. Stay with me.

29:49.408 --> 29:50.744
Hey, come on.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.638
A 50-year-old male
with penetrating trauma

30:04.639 --> 30:06.241
to the left neck.

30:06.242 --> 30:08.546
Six-inch blade. He's
80 over 40 and tachy.

30:08.547 --> 30:10.817
Coags and CBC are pending.

30:10.818 --> 30:14.090
He's typed and crossed with
four units on standby.

30:14.091 --> 30:15.727
We're prepping OR 4.

30:15.728 --> 30:17.898
We're still trying to
reach his next of kin.

30:46.489 --> 30:48.560
All clear. Shocking.

30:56.175 --> 30:57.878
<i>All clear.</i>

31:46.442 --> 31:48.614
Solloway?

31:52.387 --> 31:54.625
Hey.

31:54.626 --> 31:56.529
Sorry it took me a while to get here.

31:56.530 --> 32:00.737
They never let us know
who's coming through.

32:00.738 --> 32:04.010
I hope that Warden Hagan
wasn't too much of a hard-ass.

32:04.011 --> 32:08.218
He can really lay down the law,

32:08.219 --> 32:10.724
but, he's actually a good guy,

32:10.725 --> 32:14.364
once you get to know him.

32:14.365 --> 32:17.371
- No. He was fine. Thanks.
- Good.

32:19.843 --> 32:22.849
You don't remember me, do you?

32:25.688 --> 32:29.093
You... you look...
you look familiar.

32:29.094 --> 32:31.031
- I...
- No, I don't.

32:33.236 --> 32:35.039
John Gunther.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.731
I'm from Bloomsburg.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.569
Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania?

32:52.608 --> 32:53.943
No shit.

32:53.944 --> 32:55.647
We've actually met.

32:55.648 --> 32:57.584
It was high school. Yeah.

32:57.585 --> 32:59.487
Swim meets.

32:59.488 --> 33:01.124
Remember All-County '85?

33:01.125 --> 33:02.627
You took the whole thing.

33:02.628 --> 33:04.263
It was impressive.

33:04.264 --> 33:07.436
I was just in the back
somewhere drowning.

33:09.976 --> 33:11.712
Sure. Yeah. I...

33:11.713 --> 33:14.585
Yeah. You don't remember me.

33:14.586 --> 33:18.225
It's okay.

33:18.226 --> 33:20.395
I've been following your career.

33:20.396 --> 33:23.001
Pretty impressive stuff.

33:23.002 --> 33:27.744
Well, it hasn't exactly
worked out that well for me.

33:27.745 --> 33:31.351
Shit happens.

33:32.688 --> 33:34.257
Hey, look. I'm,

33:34.258 --> 33:36.763
gonna keep an eye out
for you, all right?

33:39.636 --> 33:41.371
Thank you.

33:44.044 --> 33:46.982
You know, over the years, I've
wanted to reach out to you,

33:46.983 --> 33:50.489
but I just never really...

33:50.490 --> 33:51.993
but here you are.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.238
Fucking Noah Solloway.

33:58.239 --> 34:00.176
Okay.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.018
Mr. Solloway?

34:08.025 --> 34:10.029
Mr. Solloway?

34:12.300 --> 34:15.672
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

34:15.674 --> 34:17.510
Well, these should help with that.

34:17.511 --> 34:20.114
That's one Zofran plus
two Percocet for pain.

34:20.116 --> 34:22.721
Here. Let me lift your head up.

34:22.722 --> 34:24.726
There you go.

34:37.717 --> 34:41.257
Can you tell me
what the date is today?

34:41.257 --> 34:45.498
September 24th.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.371
That's right. Do you know where you are?

34:48.371 --> 34:52.112
- In the hospital.
- Do you know why?

34:52.112 --> 34:55.351
- I had surgery.
- Very good.

34:55.353 --> 34:57.891
Well, you're lucky to be alive, Mr.
Solloway.

34:57.892 --> 35:00.062
Wait. What happened? What... wh...

35:00.063 --> 35:02.366
- How did I get here?
- I don't know all the details,

35:02.367 --> 35:04.838
but your wife may be able to tell you.

35:04.839 --> 35:06.675
My wife?

35:06.676 --> 35:08.913
She just stepped out to use the ladies'.

35:08.914 --> 35:10.850
She'll be so happy to see you awake.

35:10.851 --> 35:12.988
Wait. Who... who are you...
who are you talking about?

35:14.859 --> 35:19.033
Can you tell me your wife's name, Mr.
Solloway?

35:19.034 --> 35:21.572
Alison Bailey, but
she... we're not together.

35:21.573 --> 35:24.009
- Is she here?
- No.

35:24.010 --> 35:26.715
I believe she said a different name.

35:26.716 --> 35:28.251
- Helen.
- You're awake.

35:28.252 --> 35:29.955
- Told me you were sleeping.
- I just woke up.

35:29.956 --> 35:32.894
- You look okay. He looks okay.
- Feel like shit, actually.

35:32.895 --> 35:34.463
- Who told you I was here?
- Nina. I couldn't believe it.

35:34.464 --> 35:35.967
- I'm sorry.
- I almost thought that she

35:35.968 --> 35:37.604
- was joking.
- You said you were the wife?

35:37.605 --> 35:38.706
- She's my ex.
- Have the police arrived yet?

35:38.707 --> 35:39.908
- Police?
- They really

35:39.909 --> 35:41.410
- should have been here by now.
- Why?

35:41.411 --> 35:42.781
- Who did this to you?
- Who did what to me?

35:42.782 --> 35:45.085
Who stabbed you, Noah?

35:45.086 --> 35:46.755
What... what is she talking about?

35:46.756 --> 35:48.959
- Did I get stabbed?
- Why doesn't he know that?

35:48.960 --> 35:51.397
I'm-I'm very sorry, Mr. Solloway.

35:51.398 --> 35:54.671
You were attacked by
someone with a knife.

35:54.672 --> 35:56.274
You bled profusely.

35:56.275 --> 35:58.679
They took you to surgery where Dr.
Quittner

35:58.680 --> 36:00.115
closed the artery off.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.419
- Jesus.
- You were very lucky.

36:02.420 --> 36:04.691
The blade missed your airway,
and your jugular vein,

36:04.692 --> 36:06.294
and just nicked your artery.

36:06.295 --> 36:09.200
- Who did this to you?
- I don't know.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.870
I-I-I don't remember.

36:10.871 --> 36:12.874
- You can't remember anything?
- No.

36:12.875 --> 36:14.911
Well, why not? I mean
why can't he remember?

36:14.912 --> 36:16.782
I'm not sure, Mrs. Solloway.

36:16.783 --> 36:17.984
When is the surgeon coming back?

36:17.985 --> 36:19.554
'Cause I'd like to speak to him.

36:19.555 --> 36:21.457
They found you in some
student's apartment?

36:21.458 --> 36:22.994
I'm renting it.

36:22.995 --> 36:24.598
And you really don't remember anything?

36:24.599 --> 36:26.000
I remember washing
dishes late at night...

36:26.001 --> 36:27.236
Well, why were you
washing dishes so late?

36:27.237 --> 36:28.939
Could this have been an accident?

36:28.940 --> 36:31.177
- Maybe I f-fell or something.
- It was a knife, Noah.

36:31.178 --> 36:33.849
A fucking knife sliced into your throat.

36:35.186 --> 36:36.822
- Okay.
- Are you sure that

36:36.823 --> 36:39.260
he doesn't have any brain
damage or something?

36:39.261 --> 36:42.032
He had a CAT scan, and the
result came back normal.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.136
Somebody tried to kill you.
Do you understand?

36:44.137 --> 36:46.708
Can we come in now?

36:46.709 --> 36:49.280
Shit, Dad. Are you all right?

36:49.281 --> 36:53.555
Hey, kids. I've been better.
Everything's gonna be okay.

36:53.556 --> 36:55.526
Does this thing have a massage feature?

36:55.527 --> 36:57.462
Your dad's right. He's going to be fine.

36:57.463 --> 36:58.966
He should be home in a couple of days.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.003
He doesn't live with us.

37:01.004 --> 37:03.341
Um, Mr. Solloway,
I need to ask you

37:03.342 --> 37:04.911
a few more questions. I'm sorry.

37:04.912 --> 37:07.115
And then I'll let you rest.

37:07.116 --> 37:08.686
Can you tell me,

37:08.687 --> 37:10.856
do you have a history of
any previous surgeries?

37:10.857 --> 37:12.794
He had his appendix out ten years ago.

37:12.795 --> 37:14.496
That's it, unless you
count his wisdom teeth.

37:14.497 --> 37:16.033
- No.
- I think you were what,

37:16.034 --> 37:18.037
- 25 or 26?
- It's not relevant.

37:18.038 --> 37:19.975
- What about medications?
- No. He doesn't...

37:19.976 --> 37:21.645
- Are you currently taking any?
- He hates medication.

37:21.646 --> 37:22.880
He won't even take Tylenol
when he has a fever.

37:22.881 --> 37:25.318
- I'm on Vicodin.
- What?

37:25.319 --> 37:27.991
- Dosage?
- 7.5 milligrams.

37:27.992 --> 37:31.130
I had a shoulder injury.
I'm... the pain gets pretty bad.

37:31.131 --> 37:32.633
Is that getting worse?
Who's treating you?

37:32.634 --> 37:34.804
- I have a prescription, Helen.
- From who?

37:34.805 --> 37:36.641
That's all I need for now.

37:36.642 --> 37:38.812
Is there anything I can get for you, Mr.
Solloway?

37:38.813 --> 37:41.518
- No. Thank you very much.
- Can we go now?

37:41.519 --> 37:44.156
That's a good idea. Your
father could use some rest.

37:44.157 --> 37:45.993
Can you bring your
sister down to the cafeteria

37:45.994 --> 37:47.730
and get her something to eat and
I'll meet you guys there, okay?

37:47.731 --> 37:49.668
But I don't have any money.

37:52.340 --> 37:54.344
Nothing too sweet.

37:57.350 --> 37:58.418
Could you get a few more blankets?

37:58.419 --> 37:59.921
It's freezing in here.

37:59.922 --> 38:00.924
Sure.

38:08.205 --> 38:11.010
- What happened to you?
- Helen, I really need to sleep.

38:13.215 --> 38:16.855
You can stay, but just
please stop talking.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.807
<i>And I'll kill you! I'll show you!</i>

38:59.808 --> 39:02.312
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Break it up!
Break it up!</i>

39:06.221 --> 39:08.224
<i>Split it up, all right?</i>

39:08.225 --> 39:11.096
<i>You're both going to the hole next time!</i>

39:11.097 --> 39:12.465
<i>Relax!</i>

39:12.466 --> 39:15.371
- Hey, Solloway.
- Hey.

39:15.372 --> 39:18.378
Congratulations. Happy six months.

39:23.723 --> 39:25.426
Thanks.

39:27.496 --> 39:28.565
It's transparent.

39:28.566 --> 39:29.767
Right. Yeah.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.472
See if you got a shank, or contraband,

39:32.473 --> 39:33.775
or whatever, you know.

39:33.776 --> 39:35.746
It's good, right?

39:35.747 --> 39:37.182
- It's great.
- Yeah.

39:37.183 --> 39:38.852
Can you believe it?

39:38.853 --> 39:41.357
There's a place in Jersey
imports these things.

39:41.358 --> 39:43.528
Takes, like, months to get here.

39:43.529 --> 39:46.801
Prisoner got out last week
and just left it behind,

39:46.802 --> 39:50.677
so I thought that maybe,
you know, you could...

39:52.948 --> 39:54.449
I don't know how to thank you, man.

39:54.450 --> 39:56.353
Use it.

39:56.354 --> 39:57.657
- I will.
- All right.

39:57.658 --> 40:00.461
Yeah.

40:00.462 --> 40:04.136
Hey, I ordered your book.

40:04.137 --> 40:06.373
Am I gonna like it?

40:06.374 --> 40:07.878
Let me know.

40:09.414 --> 40:11.184
I will do.

40:21.404 --> 40:24.544
What, you thought I forgot you?

40:29.220 --> 40:31.090
Thank you.

40:31.091 --> 40:32.459
You're welcome.

40:54.237 --> 40:58.344
- Mr. Solloway.
- Yeah?

40:58.345 --> 41:00.849
- I'm Detective Stanton.
- Detective Romero.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.686
How you feeling? You all right?

41:02.687 --> 41:04.957
Not really. My head's pounding.

41:04.958 --> 41:06.293
Is that nurse anywhere?

41:06.294 --> 41:09.466
Um, she'll be back in a few minutes.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.807
Do you feel up to answering a
few questions in the meantime?

41:12.808 --> 41:15.077
Go ahead. Ask.

41:15.078 --> 41:16.280
Don't think I'll be
able to help you much.

41:16.281 --> 41:18.150
I don't remember a thing.

41:18.151 --> 41:21.457
Well, can you say what you do remember?

41:21.458 --> 41:23.929
I was at the sink washing dishes,

41:23.930 --> 41:27.903
and then I'm here being told
someone stabbed me in the neck.

41:27.904 --> 41:29.607
And you have no idea who
might have done that to you?

41:29.608 --> 41:31.477
- No.
- Look.

41:31.478 --> 41:32.746
We've been by the apartment,

41:32.747 --> 41:34.316
and we got our guys over there now.

41:34.317 --> 41:37.088
And so far we've seen no
signs of a forced entry,

41:37.089 --> 41:40.027
so would you happen to
recall whether or not

41:40.028 --> 41:41.129
you locked the door?

41:44.771 --> 41:46.808
I might have or not. I couldn't...

41:46.809 --> 41:48.712
why? Do you think this was a robbery?

41:48.713 --> 41:50.014
- Unlikely.
- Yeah.

41:50.015 --> 41:51.483
Not with the nature of the injury.

41:51.484 --> 41:53.120
The fact that he went
for the neck, I mean,

41:53.121 --> 41:55.124
that tells us that the assailant
meant to do real harm.

41:55.125 --> 41:57.997
- Yeah. Well, he succeeded.
- Mr. Solloway,

41:57.998 --> 42:00.670
we're treating this attack
as an attempted homicide.

42:02.172 --> 42:03.975
Jesus.

42:06.347 --> 42:07.416
What the fuck?

42:10.690 --> 42:12.793
What about the kid?

42:12.794 --> 42:15.632
- What kid?
- The frat guy.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.770
Regers or the guy I sublet...

42:17.771 --> 42:20.374
- Dan? Dan Regan?
- Right.

42:20.375 --> 42:22.145
Could they have been after him?

42:22.146 --> 42:24.382
Mr. Regan's at the station.
He's cooperating.

42:24.383 --> 42:26.521
Yeah, I mean, plus, you
know, like you say,

42:26.522 --> 42:28.959
he's a 20-year-old Delta Phi kid,

42:28.960 --> 42:30.996
and you just finished
three years at Fishkill.

42:30.997 --> 42:32.833
You're a public figure.

42:37.209 --> 42:40.214
So if either one of
you was gonna be targeted,

42:40.215 --> 42:41.350
we're gonna lean towards you.

42:41.351 --> 42:42.820
I mean, would you agree with that?

42:42.821 --> 42:44.724
- Fine.
- Try to think then.

42:44.725 --> 42:46.393
Is there anyone out there
that's got a gripe with you?

42:46.394 --> 42:48.565
Might want to harm you?

42:51.037 --> 42:55.746
What's your relationship like
with Cole Lockhart these days?

42:55.747 --> 42:58.585
- We don't have one.
- When's the last time

42:58.586 --> 43:00.221
you had any contact with Mr. Lockhart?

43:00.222 --> 43:03.293
I don't know. Years ago.

43:03.294 --> 43:04.964
The trial, I guess.

43:04.965 --> 43:06.901
- Brother's murder trial?
- Right.

43:06.902 --> 43:09.205
Yeah, well, between
what happened to his brother

43:09.206 --> 43:10.876
and the affair with his wife,

43:10.877 --> 43:14.049
Cole is definitely a person of interest.

43:14.050 --> 43:17.923
But, um, what about Alison Bailey?

43:20.697 --> 43:22.833
What about her?

43:22.834 --> 43:24.269
You're still married.

43:24.270 --> 43:27.442
- Yes.
- But estranged.

43:27.443 --> 43:30.247
Wow. You guys know everything
about me, don't you?

43:30.248 --> 43:33.053
Does she still have any
feelings left for you?

43:33.054 --> 43:35.291
How the fuck do I know?

43:35.292 --> 43:37.629
Well, what we're trying to figure out is

43:37.630 --> 43:40.869
if she'd have a problem with
you seeing other women.

43:40.870 --> 43:42.305
Lucky for her, I've been incarcerated

43:42.306 --> 43:44.109
the last three years,

43:44.110 --> 43:47.115
and since I got out I've
been a fucking monk, so...

43:47.116 --> 43:51.089
So, um, Ms., um, Le Gall?

43:52.259 --> 43:54.062
Ms. Le who?

43:54.063 --> 43:56.399
Yeah. Juliette Le Gall.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.571
The woman who found you
and brought you in.

44:02.146 --> 44:03.848
- Juliette found me?
- Yeah.

44:03.849 --> 44:08.257
Juliette found you at 1:38 a. m.

44:08.258 --> 44:11.531
What's your relationship with her?

44:11.532 --> 44:13.768
Well, we met yesterday.
I barely know her.

44:13.769 --> 44:15.872
And yet she was at your house at one...

44:15.873 --> 44:17.643
No, no, no. She wasn't at my house.

44:17.644 --> 44:20.549
I was at her house with several
other people, and then I left.

44:20.550 --> 44:21.818
Everything okay in here?

44:21.819 --> 44:23.120
Yeah, we're good.

44:23.121 --> 44:24.757
Yeah. We'll be done in just a minute.

44:24.758 --> 44:25.992
Look, Mr. Solloway, we're
all on the same side here.

44:25.993 --> 44:27.428
If you just relax...

44:27.429 --> 44:28.932
Relax? Someone tried to fucking kill me,

44:28.933 --> 44:30.735
and you got nothing.

44:30.736 --> 44:33.140
You have no fucking clue who
might actually have done this.

44:33.141 --> 44:35.277
- And when you say "actually"...
- Can you ask them to go?

44:35.278 --> 44:38.016
Just go and do their jobs?

44:38.017 --> 44:39.620
Will you do that for me, please?

44:39.621 --> 44:42.291
I... maybe you
can come back later?

44:42.292 --> 44:43.595
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:43.596 --> 44:45.599
Get some rest, Mr. Solloway.

44:50.610 --> 44:52.679
Buzz me when it's filled up.

45:00.195 --> 45:01.899
Thanks a lot.

45:06.842 --> 45:08.477
You're coming home with me.

45:08.478 --> 45:11.349
- Nina, no.
- And why not?

45:11.350 --> 45:12.686
'Cause for all I know
your husband's the one

45:12.687 --> 45:14.422
- who tried to kill me.
- Please.

45:14.423 --> 45:17.129
JP's not smart enough to
get away with murder.

45:29.721 --> 45:32.458
Who the hell lives here?

45:32.459 --> 45:35.632
A friend.

45:35.633 --> 45:38.003
Really? You just got stabbed.

45:38.004 --> 45:39.807
Now you want to go get a booty call?

45:39.808 --> 45:44.817
Apparently she... apparently
she saved my life.

45:44.818 --> 45:47.421
What was she doing at your
apartment at midnight?

45:47.422 --> 45:49.159
I don't know.

45:52.934 --> 45:55.437
I'll wait. I'll take you home after.

45:55.438 --> 45:58.878
No, no, I'm gonna be okay.
You just go home.

45:58.879 --> 46:00.850
I'll... I'll call you tomorrow.

46:04.624 --> 46:08.865
Nina, what are you doing?

46:08.866 --> 46:12.672
I'm crying, you asshole.

46:12.673 --> 46:15.846
Come on. You don't cry. You're
the tough one, remember?

46:21.691 --> 46:22.826
Fucking take them, Noah.

46:24.163 --> 46:26.266
Take them. He left the house to you.

46:26.267 --> 46:28.103
- I don't want it.
- I don't either.

46:28.104 --> 46:30.274
- Well, then fucking sell it.
- I can't.

46:30.275 --> 46:33.346
- Why not?
- You know why.

46:33.347 --> 46:36.453
Nina, I am 50 years old.

46:36.454 --> 46:39.893
You can stop apologizing to me now.

46:39.894 --> 46:43.433
Right. Well, that's...
that's your psychosis.

46:43.434 --> 46:46.106
I'm fine.

46:46.107 --> 46:48.443
- Really?
- It was 30 years ago.

46:48.444 --> 46:50.214
Let's move on.

46:50.215 --> 46:53.221
Well, you're certainly really
good at that, aren't you?

47:39.479 --> 47:42.351
I thought you were the
detectives with more questions.

47:42.352 --> 47:46.760
- They've already been here?
- Just like a TV show.

47:46.761 --> 47:51.102
The younger one even carried
a cup of takeout coffee.

47:51.103 --> 47:53.641
That must have been exciting, right?

47:53.642 --> 47:55.945
Didn't you say you were bored?

47:55.946 --> 47:58.784
Ha.

47:58.785 --> 48:01.658
This is okay?

48:13.281 --> 48:16.019
You must have been frightened.

48:16.020 --> 48:20.995
I actually don't remember it happening.

48:20.996 --> 48:23.000
Strange.

48:27.275 --> 48:29.813
I'm afraid I've also forgotten...

48:29.814 --> 48:33.153
why you were there.

48:33.154 --> 48:36.160
You didn't forget. You
weren't expecting me.

48:48.417 --> 48:50.889
I'm sorry to have scared you.

48:53.494 --> 48:57.434
Honestly, I wasn't scared.

48:57.435 --> 49:00.207
I was angry.

49:00.208 --> 49:03.079
- Why?
- I don't know.

49:03.080 --> 49:07.522
I guess I was hoping that you...

49:07.523 --> 49:11.497
that this wouldn't be so complicated.

49:27.095 --> 49:29.098
Are you all right?

49:29.099 --> 49:30.836
<i>Oui.</i>

49:33.174 --> 49:35.178
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

49:56.721 --> 50:01.329
I imagine the doctors told
you not to strain yourself.

50:01.330 --> 50:03.767
They say that to everybody.

50:07.141 --> 50:09.245
I make it a rule never
to sleep with a man

50:09.246 --> 50:13.521
after being interrogated
for his attempted murder.

50:13.522 --> 50:16.492
After all, I'm a suspect.

50:16.493 --> 50:20.301
It would look very bad if you
were to drop dead at my home.

50:23.007 --> 50:24.809
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

50:24.810 --> 50:26.547
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

50:59.045 --> 51:01.718
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

51:11.804 --> 51:14.543
- How'd you like it?
- I'm really enjoying it.

51:16.179 --> 51:19.184
I wrote it a long time ago.

51:19.185 --> 51:22.725
Hey, would...

51:22.726 --> 51:25.731
would you sign this for me?

51:25.732 --> 51:27.335
Sure.

51:32.913 --> 51:35.919
- To John?
- Gunther's good.

51:44.937 --> 51:47.943
- Here you go.
- Nice.

51:52.418 --> 51:55.758
"To my old friend, Gunther."

52:00.802 --> 52:02.806
Who is that?

52:06.346 --> 52:08.116
That's my wife.

52:08.117 --> 52:10.253
"Lana"? Yeah.

52:10.254 --> 52:13.126
No, n-no. The... the... the book's not...

52:15.932 --> 52:18.069
I'm divorced.

52:18.070 --> 52:19.104
Sorry to hear that.

52:26.453 --> 52:30.828
You know, what you got there
is an inmate violation.

52:30.829 --> 52:33.901
You can't hang a poster on the wall.

52:33.902 --> 52:36.105
It's... it's not a poster.
It's a photo.

52:36.106 --> 52:37.474
It's...

52:40.281 --> 52:41.817
I'm gonna hang on to this for safety.

52:41.818 --> 52:43.687
- Come on, don't...
- Hey!

52:48.096 --> 52:49.799
Fuck.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.972
I'm gonna keep this nice and safe.

52:59.787 --> 53:00.988
Have a nice day.

53:00.989 --> 53:03.727
Fuck.

53:40.301 --> 53:45.343
Detective Stanton? Hi.
It's Noah Solloway.

53:45.344 --> 53:47.682
I think I know who attacked me.

53:47.683 --> 53:54.227
He's a guard at Fishkill
named John Gunther.

53:54.228 --> 53:58.102
He's been following
me since I got out.

53:58.103 --> 54:00.073
The guy's a real monster.
