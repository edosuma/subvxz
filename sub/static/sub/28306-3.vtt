WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:06.180
Fosse/Verdon.

00:08.312 --> 00:11.011
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.316 --> 00:15.058
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:19.758 --> 00:22.935
LASZLO: I have recently
rediscovered my love

00:22.979 --> 00:25.112
for topiary sculpture.

00:25.155 --> 00:28.245
The art of bush manipulation.

00:28.289 --> 00:32.293
We have Anubis,
the Egyptian god of death.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.337
Here is a chimera.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.296
This one, I'm the most proud of.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.994
This is the bunny,
simply because it ended up

00:38.038 --> 00:40.214
exactly the same
as I had in my head.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.259
-And up here...
-SEAN: Yo, Laz!

00:42.303 --> 00:43.913
All right, Sean.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.524
Bitch kicked me out again.
Can you believe it?

00:46.568 --> 00:48.135
She ought to
strangle you to death

00:48.178 --> 00:50.267
with your own sphincter muscle.

00:50.311 --> 00:53.140
-What did you just say?
-I said something

00:53.183 --> 00:55.229
which you will
heartily agree with.

00:56.534 --> 01:00.103
Yeah, I hear that, bro.
That's-that's messed up.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.670
Have a good night.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.151
His wife will probably kill him.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.196
Which leads me on
to the fairer sex.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.112
What you're about to seeare the topiary representations

01:09.156 --> 01:12.463
of the vulvas of some
of my favorite prostitutes

01:12.507 --> 01:14.248
and women I have loved.

01:14.291 --> 01:17.599
Polly Nichols
from Whitechapel, 1888.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.340
Oh, that's my good
lady wife Nadja.

01:19.383 --> 01:22.125
Don't think she'd like you tosee that, but who gives a fuck?

01:22.169 --> 01:24.388
Beautiful.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.565
That's Nancy Reagan at the end.It's a bit untidy.

01:27.609 --> 01:31.352
And here we have
the pièce de résistance,

01:31.395 --> 01:34.485
my mother.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.357
What the...

01:36.400 --> 01:38.315
You're kidding.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.317
Ugh!

01:40.361 --> 01:42.319
That's werewolf piss.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.365
Werewolf piss.

01:44.408 --> 01:49.196
This box contains
all my werewolf traps.

01:49.239 --> 01:52.373
That's what we're looking for,
the Wulfsfalle.

01:52.416 --> 01:55.245
That'll do the business.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.771
♪ Don't sing if you want
to live long♪

01:59.815 --> 02:02.426
♪ They have no use

02:02.470 --> 02:06.082

02:29.801 --> 02:32.978
COLIN:
Am I a morning person?

02:33.022 --> 02:37.069
That would be
an enthusiastic "yes."

02:37.113 --> 02:39.637
I really enjoy the mornings.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.552
Let's see what Nandor's up to.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.424
Nandor?

02:43.467 --> 02:45.382
I wake up hungry,
and I get to feed all day.

02:45.426 --> 02:48.820
NANDOR: Go away, please,
Colin Robinson.

02:48.864 --> 02:52.084
Nandor, it's time
to name that tune.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.261
NANDOR:Guillermo, get him out of here!

02:54.304 --> 02:55.871
-Will you get out of here?
-I made it up.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.482
-NANDOR:
Can't you see I am sleeping?
-Please get out.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.571
Get out.

03:00.615 --> 03:04.227
That's what I call
my "morning cup of coffee."

03:04.271 --> 03:06.447
Dan, how are you?

03:06.490 --> 03:09.406
Mornings are great for feeding. People aren't really,

03:09.450 --> 03:12.061
you know, frustrated yet
by the entire day.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.584
If you don't want to have kids,

03:13.628 --> 03:16.239
then I would keep that phone
in your pocket.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.635
Arnie. You know,I was thinking about the whole,

03:20.678 --> 03:24.073
uh, Q-tip debate
that we've been having,

03:24.116 --> 03:26.118
and, you know, science says

03:26.162 --> 03:28.512
that you shouldn't
stick anything

03:28.556 --> 03:31.123
smaller than your elbow
into your ear.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.864
Talk about damage
to the ear canal.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.257
-Am I not right?
-I just can't.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.868
Yeah, no, and, uh...

03:39.741 --> 03:41.917
There's someone new
in the office.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.268
If you get 'em before this placegrinds them down,

03:45.312 --> 03:47.488
you get so much fresh energy.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.278
Knock, knock.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.498
Let me be the ad hoc
welcoming committee.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.500
I am Colin Robinson.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.415
You're gonna be hearing
a lot more about me.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.113
-Oh, probably not.
-Oh, no.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.071
Nonsense. People talk.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.291
-Not to me, they don't.
-Look at that.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.294
-Personalized nameplate, huh?
-Yeah, I-I had it made because

04:11.338 --> 04:13.383
people don't usually
remember my name.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.471
Oh.

04:14.515 --> 04:15.864
Since we're on friendly terms,

04:15.907 --> 04:17.561
let me give you a little advice.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.564
The water fountain,
I have reason to believe,

04:20.608 --> 04:22.087
is not filtered.

04:22.131 --> 04:24.307
I wouldn't dare
go by the water fountain.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.875
What if everybody laughed?

04:26.918 --> 04:30.531
Wh-Why...
why would they do that?

04:30.574 --> 04:33.011
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting

04:33.055 --> 04:35.144
to hear a kind word.

04:35.187 --> 04:39.017
I've been all alone
since Mother died, so...

04:39.061 --> 04:41.716
Oh. I'm-I'm just
talking to you. I...

04:42.934 --> 04:44.762
-There, there.
-Thank you.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.811
-Talk later?
-Yeah.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.030
-Really?
-Yeah, I said we would.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.510
I'd love to chat later.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.471
COLIN:
Oh, what the hell was that?

04:57.514 --> 04:59.429
I didn't get anything from her.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.735
Nothing.

05:02.258 --> 05:06.001
I think there's
something weird about Evie.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.968
NADJA:
This is mine
and Laszlo's crypt.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.406
I decorated it myself.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.364
This one is a very special
creature to me.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.931
When I first met Laszlo,

05:22.974 --> 05:24.933
I was walking
on the moors with him,

05:24.976 --> 05:27.501
and this owl flew over
and scratched my head,

05:27.544 --> 05:30.591
and I said, "Kill that fucking
bitch, please, Laszlo."

05:30.634 --> 05:32.549
If me and Laszlo were
to have ever had a child,

05:32.593 --> 05:35.944
I like to imagine
it would look like him.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.511
Small and hard.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.817
I hate this goat.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.604
What is that?

05:43.647 --> 05:45.214
It's werewolf.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.482
Coming from outside.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.484
There's a bloody big werewolf
on the lawn.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.660
Quick.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.183
-Ugh, ugh.
-Ew.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.490
-Bloody big one.
-Quick, we need
to get it inside.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.666
- It stinks.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.538
-Why is its foot in a trap?

06:04.581 --> 06:06.453
-NADJA:
Laszlo, did you lay a trap?
-NANDOR: What?

06:06.496 --> 06:08.672
LASZLO:
No, no, nothing to do with me.
Let's just get it

06:08.716 --> 06:10.761
-off the grass.
-NANDOR: It's okay. It's okay.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.284
It's okay. The neighbors,

06:12.328 --> 06:14.025
-the neighbors.
-LASZLO: Shh.
He's losing conscious.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.071
-NANDOR: Go to sleep now.
-LASZLO: That's it, that's it.

06:16.114 --> 06:19.596
-Go to sleep, Mr. Werewolf.
-LASZLO: That's it.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.990
-NANDOR: Okay, this way. Go, go.-

06:22.033 --> 06:24.079
-NADJA: The boy
should be helping.
-NANDOR: He is helping.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.516
-NANDOR: Where do we take it,
the basement?
-LASZLO: Fancy room.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.692
NANDOR:
But we just spring-cleaned.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.782
-Master, is it safe
to be this close to it?
-Probably not, Guillermo.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.480
Well, when it wakes up,
won't it kill me?

06:33.523 --> 06:36.396
Yes, probably. But we have moreimportant things to talk about.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.487
We need to get rid of him.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.662
And when I say get rid of him,

06:41.705 --> 06:43.664
I mean... pfft!

06:43.707 --> 06:45.492
No! The werewolf lives.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.885
Otherwise we endanger
the sanctity of the Truce.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.931
-The Truce?
-Ah, the Truce.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.454
I hate the Truce.

06:51.498 --> 06:52.499
NANDOR:
For tens

06:52.542 --> 06:54.675
upon tens of years,

06:54.718 --> 06:57.460
the vampire
and werewolf communities

06:57.504 --> 07:02.683
live in a wary peace
because of the Truce.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.728
Vampire does not harm werewolf,

07:04.772 --> 07:08.906
so long as werewolf doesn'tinterfere with any vampire shit.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.734
His friends might
know he's here.

07:10.778 --> 07:13.041
Which means all of his friends
will come and visit him.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.043
Okay, let us put a muzzle
on him, take him to a park,

07:15.086 --> 07:16.131
tie him to a bench.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.698
He's waking up.
He's waking up!

07:17.741 --> 07:20.352
Oh, God.

07:20.396 --> 07:24.356
Why do you guys have
a werewolf trap?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.533
I mean, a normal trap
on your lawn?

07:26.576 --> 07:28.752
NADJA:
We know you're a big
bloody werewolf.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.059
I saw you screechingand scratching around the garden

07:31.102 --> 07:32.539
like a big, disgusting wet dog.

07:32.582 --> 07:36.760
-Yeah, so the game's up,
you bastard.

07:36.804 --> 07:37.892
Luckily for you guys,

07:37.935 --> 07:39.981
I have incredible
healing abilities.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.550
I'm already
recovering completely.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.727
Ow!

07:46.770 --> 07:48.859
-He's gonna shit.
-Oh, no.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.905
When my werewolf brethren
and sisteren

07:50.948 --> 07:53.560
find out about this,
they will not be happy.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.348
LASZLO:
Ah, shit.

07:59.391 --> 08:03.004
-He's broken the bloody window.- My other leg!

08:03.047 --> 08:04.614
This is bad.
This is very bad.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.137
-Yes, this is very bad.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.139
I'm coming back with the pack.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.880
And by then,
I'll be 100% healed.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.448
Don't worry about that.
Ow!

08:12.492 --> 08:14.798
-He could've killed me.
-Possibly, but you know,

08:14.842 --> 08:16.757
-these things happen.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.543
Hey, Kamal. Put on a little
weight this weekend, no?

08:22.153 --> 08:24.460
Hey, Jeannie. Ooh.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.941
Man, what's an antonym
for "jealous"?

08:26.984 --> 08:28.769
'Cause that's how I feel
about your workload

08:28.812 --> 08:30.640
right now.

08:33.861 --> 08:37.212
Arnie. You're gonna kill me,
but I think I am going to

08:37.255 --> 08:41.738
change my position on the wholeQ-tip conundrum that we had.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.567
-Arnie, are you even
listening to me?
-Huh, Colin?

08:44.611 --> 08:48.353
Sorry. I was...
talking to the new girl.

08:48.397 --> 08:51.748
She told me the saddest story
about her nephew.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.664
Born with his eyeballs
facing backwards.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.753
So can he see his brains?

08:56.797 --> 08:59.974
I think the new girl
is an emotional vampire.

09:00.017 --> 09:03.717
They're an advanced form
of energy vampire.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.068
But instead of frustrating
the people around them

09:07.111 --> 09:10.811
for energy, they feed off
of pity. Look at her.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.726
There's not gonna be
anything left

09:12.769 --> 09:14.858
when she's done with Dave,
I'll tell you that much.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.818
This whole damn office is empty.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.471
Evie.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.299
E.V.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.998
Emotional vamp... Oh, hell.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.742
It's on, Evie Russell.
Oh, it's on.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.744
Biff! Hey.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.484
Hey, Biff.
Could I have a word with you?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.269
Biff, just a second, Biff.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.879
-Just gonna use
the bathroom first.
-Quick question about...

09:35.923 --> 09:37.707
EVIE:
Biff, I had a... Actually,

09:37.751 --> 09:39.666
-I had a quick question.
- Biff, we need
to discuss...

09:39.709 --> 09:42.625
BIFF:
Can this wait till we get
out of the bathroom?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.279
-EVIE: 'Cause it's kind of
feminine-related.
-Uh, Biff, you're gon...

09:44.322 --> 09:45.628
-I can't exact...

09:45.672 --> 09:47.848
-Biff, Biff, Biff.
-Biff, I can't exactly...

09:47.891 --> 09:49.719
-Hold on, hold on.
-BIFF: Oh, man!

09:49.763 --> 09:51.678
Biff, I-I think my dog
might be autistic,

09:51.721 --> 09:53.723
-and I need a shoulder
to cry on.
-Biff.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.638
-Please, Biff.
-BIFF:
What is happening, Colin?

09:55.682 --> 09:57.684
COLIN:
What do you think of
the new toilet paper in here?

09:57.727 --> 09:59.686
-I was wondering... Let go!
-BIFF: This is crazy.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.644
COLIN:
Oh, you don't use, uh,
toilet paper liner, huh?

10:01.688 --> 10:03.254
Biff, I just need
to talk to you, please.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.778
COLIN:Not a seat protector dude, huh?

10:04.821 --> 10:07.302
I'm just so sad,
and I don't know what to do.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.565
BIFF:
I'm not feeling well.
I-I... I feel really weak.

10:11.262 --> 10:14.744
COLIN:
You know, the Greek
phrasing for "coma"

10:14.788 --> 10:16.920
-is "deep sleep."

10:19.053 --> 10:21.272
Poor Biff.

10:29.367 --> 10:32.501
LASZLO:One, two, three silver bullets.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.546
How are we gonna
kill a whole wolf pack

10:34.590 --> 10:36.113
with just three silver bullets?

10:36.157 --> 10:37.854
It's worse than that--
we don't even have a gun.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.029
No gun?

10:39.073 --> 10:41.466
-The wolf pack.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.904
She is here.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.297
LASZLO:
What the blazes?

10:46.341 --> 10:48.822
Look, two werewolves,

10:48.865 --> 10:49.866
as bold as brass.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.521
And I can even sense one
behind me.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.915
NADJA:
She's emptying her wolf snatch
all over the bushes!

10:54.958 --> 10:57.178
All right, you've made yourpoint. Let's call this a night.

10:57.221 --> 11:00.094
: Oh, no.
We're just getting started.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.966
Way to go, Deb.
Good, strong stream.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.751
ANGE:
Yeah. We had the piss.

11:04.794 --> 11:08.624
-Now we need the blood.
-Someone's finally speaking
my language.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.713
--Get ready to start speaking it

11:10.757 --> 11:12.367
our your butt,you
Sense and Sensibilitybitch.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.064
-ARJAN: Ange, Ange, Ange.
-What-what are we doing?

11:14.108 --> 11:15.849
You're ramping it up
pretty quick here.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.851
Let's build up.
Let's build up to something.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.418
What I don't understand is why
you texted us all, woke us up

11:20.462 --> 11:22.159
and told us to come here to
what, just piss on everything?

11:22.203 --> 11:24.771
-Are we gonna get on with this?-...lack of organization, man.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.990
I'm just gonna need
a second here.

11:27.034 --> 11:27.991
You're doing it again.
You're undermining me.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.080
No, you made us look
like turds, man.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.169
-Can you stop crying
on my lawn, please?

11:32.213 --> 11:35.303
-Let's talk about it later.
-Okay. Let's do it later.

11:36.826 --> 11:37.958
At last.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.394
Give me some space.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.744
You'll need more than space,
me old chap.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.572
NADJA:
Go on, Laszlo.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.186
-Oh, no.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.580
Not my bunny. Look.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.364
No, that's my rabbit.
That's my best one.

11:53.408 --> 11:56.411
-My sciatica.
-Don't worry, darling.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.026
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

12:03.070 --> 12:04.898
Here comes the party poop.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.596
You can't be fighting
with werewolves on the lawn.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.032
You'll alert
the human neighbors.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.165
And there's a bus stop
outside the house.

12:11.208 --> 12:14.037
Well, don't appear as a mist
on the lawn, then, you prick.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.039
What the hell's going on
over there, Laz?

12:16.083 --> 12:17.824
Nothing, Sean.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.000
Everything's all right
on this lawn.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.785
Just how I like it.
And I'm going inside.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.221
LASZLO:
It's just the neighbor.
Carry on.

12:24.265 --> 12:28.443
If we are to battle,
we must follow the protocols.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.010
Of course we're gonna
follow the protocols.

12:30.053 --> 12:30.924
-To the protocols.
-Sure.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.230
And now there's lots of dogs
going in my house.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.841
NANDOR:
Shit, have you got a key?

12:41.848 --> 12:44.024
It's very tense.

12:44.067 --> 12:47.505
Vampires, werewolves,

12:47.549 --> 12:51.509
give me a moment to find
the relevant passage.

12:54.295 --> 12:57.864
So, are all you werewolves
Indians?

12:57.907 --> 13:00.083
-Oh, here we go again.
-Fucking Twilight.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.216
No, we're not all Indians.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.914
In fact... well, I'm an Indian.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.873
But that's because my father's
from India. I think you're

13:06.916 --> 13:09.049
not even talking about
that kind of Indian, though.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.746
I think you're talking about
a Native American,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.879
-like Marcus.
-Yeah, but I'm not a werewolf

13:12.922 --> 13:15.098
-becauseI'm Native American.
-ARJAN: That's right.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.883
All right?
It's not an ethnic thing.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.233
-That's one guy.
-MARCUS: We're all different.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.061
-I'm African-American.
-That's right.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.758
-ALL: Oh.
-ANGE: Yeah.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.326
I'm Caribbean-Canadian.
Saskatoon, motherfucker.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.110
-That's right.
-Yeah.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.895
-I'm Caucasian.
-That's-that's right.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.897
-That's Chad.
-NANDOR: If anyone
is interested,

13:30.940 --> 13:33.203
-I have found the...-LASZLO: Yes, get on with this.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.902
...relevant passage for...

13:35.945 --> 13:39.340
This was written in 1993.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.863
-Wow.
-And it states,

13:40.907 --> 13:43.300
"Should a werewolf pack

13:43.344 --> 13:46.086
have a beef
with a vampire house..."

13:46.129 --> 13:47.914
That's us.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.004
"...the two groups
shall not battle,

13:51.047 --> 13:53.571
"but elect from amongst them

13:53.615 --> 13:56.096
"their strongest fighter.

13:56.139 --> 13:59.012
"The two fighters will face off

13:59.055 --> 14:02.102
-"in one-on-one combat...
-No.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.321
...on neutral ground."

14:04.365 --> 14:07.368
Okay. Staten Island
Werewolf Support Group.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.765
Uh, vampires in this room.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.899
NANDOR:
Not you, Guillermo.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.949
COLIN:
It's on, Evie Russell.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.602
Oh, it's on.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.694
-Evie Russell.
-Colin Robinson.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.305
-Working late?
-I have to. I'm behind.

14:31.348 --> 14:34.047
I like your skirt.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.050
You should be careful,
because mauve attracts bees.

14:37.093 --> 14:40.314
I was wearing this skirt when mysister got her cancer diagnosis.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.490
Cancer isn't usually
what kills you.

14:42.533 --> 14:43.839
It's the treatment.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.493
She was killed
by a drunk driver.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.322
He was my fiancé.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.064
Violence often begins at home.
Studies indicate...

14:51.107 --> 14:54.937
-I've never had a home!

14:54.981 --> 14:57.548
Remind me to e-mail you
a link to a Slatearticle

14:57.592 --> 14:59.724
on the millennial
housing crisis.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.944
I don't use e-mail

15:01.988 --> 15:04.164
ever since my computer
was hacked

15:04.207 --> 15:06.122
and my identity was stolen.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.517
Hackers,featuring Johnny Lee
Miller and Fisher Stevens,

15:09.560 --> 15:12.737
is one of the few movies
from 1995

15:12.781 --> 15:14.957
that still holds up!

15:15.001 --> 15:17.568
I was held up at gunpoint

15:17.612 --> 15:20.528
while waiting in line
to see that movie.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.530
But they didn't take any money.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.749
They just did it for fun!

15:33.019 --> 15:34.672
Human form.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.979
Come on!

15:39.503 --> 15:41.244
We're five minutes early.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.767
COLIN:
You know...

15:42.811 --> 15:45.466
we don't have to be enemies.

15:45.509 --> 15:48.251
Have you ever considered
hunting with a partner?

15:48.295 --> 15:50.819
The thought has only recently
crossed my mind.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.258
Rhonda.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.695
I was wondering
if you could settle a bet.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.525
Tonight is a good night to die.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.311
Oh, I don't want you to die,
Master.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.140
Not me to die,

16:07.183 --> 16:09.055
-the other guy to die.
-Oh.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.665
Maybe don't say it like that.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.493
Okay.

16:14.538 --> 16:17.019
Tonight is a good night
for the other guy,

16:17.063 --> 16:19.152
-not me, to die.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.457
They're here.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.937
Sorry we're late.
Sorry we're late.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.286
Bridge was a nightmare.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.288
Hello, mongrels.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.290
-You haunted house bitch!

16:27.334 --> 16:30.250
We meet on the roof of this
abandoned Circuit City

16:30.293 --> 16:31.947
in accordance with the protocols

16:31.991 --> 16:34.080
of the Staten Island
Lycanthrope-Vampire Agreement

16:34.123 --> 16:35.733
of 1993.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.432
And so it begins.
Have you chosen your champion?

16:38.475 --> 16:39.868
Oh, yeah.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.739
-We chose Toby.

16:41.783 --> 16:45.656
-Oh, that is a very big one.
-I don't remember this one.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.224
-Is he a new one?
-ANGE: Oh, he's a new
gigantic werewolf.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.183
This isn't even full-size.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.749
-This is just,
like, regular Toby.
-NANDOR: Ah...

16:51.793 --> 16:53.229
He-he gets like this big.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.275
LASZLO:
Yeah, well, we've got
our own champion.

16:55.318 --> 16:59.061
He goes by the name of
Nandor the Relentless.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.542
-Hi.-And he's going to mess you up,

17:01.585 --> 17:03.109
Toby.

17:03.152 --> 17:06.112
-Don't antagonize him, Nadja.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.070
You desecrated my vulva garden.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.507
Namely, my mother's vulva.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.944
You turned it brown
and wizened.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.121
-NADJA: You made it look like
his sister's vulva.
-LASZLO: Exactly.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.297
What type of man
would endure such an insult

17:17.340 --> 17:19.429
from a pack
of filthy werewolf scum?

17:20.952 --> 17:22.345
ARJAN:This is what I'm talking about.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.956
-Let's throw down already.
-I'll throw you down.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.350
Sure thing, Downton Abbey,
I'll knock you out.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.744
-ARJAN: Okay, let's just
take things down a notch

17:29.787 --> 17:31.311
and then fight to the death.

17:31.354 --> 17:32.964
Ah, I don't know.

17:33.008 --> 17:36.011
Is this turkey cut
freshly from the breast?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.100
Or is it a preprocessed roll?

17:38.144 --> 17:40.494
All of our meats
are actually freshly sliced.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.148
Hmm.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.584
I prefer the roll.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.325
Please don't start.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.154
I don't want to get into anotherargument in public right now.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.156
We got married
out of convenience.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.896
I have Munchausen's by proxy.

17:51.940 --> 17:55.117
I tell people he's sick
so I feel better.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.336
But then I do get sick.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.989
And when I do get sick,

17:58.033 --> 17:59.513
people don't believe
that I'm sick.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.167
Because they know she does

18:01.210 --> 18:03.691
Munchausen by proxy
all the time.

18:03.734 --> 18:06.824
Do you guys want
to eat your food?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.783
BOTH:
We're feeding right now.

18:13.309 --> 18:17.052
Vampires... and werewolves.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.489
This is a fight that has been
fought with honor

18:19.533 --> 18:22.231
for a thousand--
I say a thousand-- years.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.277
-And tonight...

18:24.320 --> 18:27.932
I'm not gonna do this if yourman's pissing against the wall.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.413
-Fuck off, you racist.
-ANGE: Okay, no.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.198
No more bullshit.
We fight.

18:32.241 --> 18:35.723
-I agree with the werewolf slut.-Thank you.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.594
-ARJAN: Do it, Toby. Do it.
-ANGE: It's all you, man.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.770
-LASZLO: I'd say surrender,

18:39.814 --> 18:42.991
but it's my mother's vulva
we're talking about.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.427
-NANDOR: He's quite big.
-Come on, Toby, yeah!

18:44.471 --> 18:46.212
NADJA:Come on, Nandor, you can do it.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.214
We need a new rug for the house.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.216
-LASZLO: Yeah.
-NADJA: I thought you

18:50.259 --> 18:52.827
messy beasts didn't do this
until there was a full moon.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.872
This guy,
he just pictures the moon.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.787
He's got a great imagination.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.398
-Yeah, Toby!

18:58.441 --> 19:00.443
-ARJAN: All right,
don't worry, I got that.-It's not a naked fight, is it?

19:00.487 --> 19:02.228
Don't think so, no.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.232
Uh...

19:06.275 --> 19:08.408
LASZLO:
You know, we could just...

19:08.451 --> 19:10.061
What about Gizmo?

19:10.105 --> 19:12.455
-LASZLO: Shh!
-ARJAN: Who?

19:12.499 --> 19:14.196
Champions, choose your weapons.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.806
No silver.

19:15.850 --> 19:19.462
I will let my esteemed
challenger choose first.

19:19.506 --> 19:23.118
-He chooses teeth and claws.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.338
Oh, he's gonna claw that dildo
right off your head, man.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.644
-Uh, hey.
-Yeah.

19:27.688 --> 19:31.431
Okay. I will choose--

19:31.474 --> 19:33.476
nunchucks, scimitar--

19:33.520 --> 19:35.435
-this!
-ARJAN: What is it?

19:35.478 --> 19:37.263
-NADJA: Oh, no.
-LASZLO: Oh, no.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.090
-NADJA: Nandor.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.703
-Hey!
-What? No! Toby, no!

19:42.746 --> 19:44.444
ANGE:
No, Toby!

19:44.487 --> 19:47.490
-ARJAN: Oh, oh, God. Toby.
-CHAD: What the hell?
That's cheating!

19:47.534 --> 19:49.579
-LASZLO: Well played.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.015
-MARCUS: Oh... oh, no.
-ANGE: Toby, man.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.626
-MARCUS: Oh, God.
-ARJAN: Don't worry, Toby,

19:52.669 --> 19:54.845
-you're gonna heal up
just fine, pal.
-Did I win?

19:54.889 --> 19:57.370
-I think I won.
-ARJAN: Whatever.
I guess this one goes

19:57.413 --> 19:58.414
-to the vampires, then.
-Okay.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.503
Can you leave us
to lick our wounds?

20:00.547 --> 20:04.377
-LASZLO: Okay.
-Tob... Toby,
don't lick your wounds.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.595
-LASZLO: Bat.
-See you back at home.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.294
-No, please don't...

20:08.337 --> 20:09.817
ARJAN:
It looks... honestly,
it looks better than it did

20:09.860 --> 20:11.297
-five minutes ago already.
-DOUGIE: Come on, Toby.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.516
You'll get through this,
and then we'll take that trip

20:13.560 --> 20:14.604
-to Saskatoon
we've been talking about.
-ARJAN: Hey!

20:14.648 --> 20:16.650
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, man.

20:16.693 --> 20:19.653
You think
we could keep the bone?

20:19.696 --> 20:22.090
-Yeah. Yeah. That-that's okay.
-Yeah?

20:22.133 --> 20:23.918
Okay, cool. Cool, guys.
All right, guys, spread out.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.615
Let's find that son of a bitch.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.400
ANGE:
Mind where you're walking.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.490
If you hear a squeak,you may have stepped on the toy.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.927
ARJAN:
I'll stay with Toby.
He's gonna be fine.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.973
-He's healing already.

20:38.585 --> 20:42.066
COLIN:
Dating Evie is never dull.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.112
She certainly knows

20:44.155 --> 20:46.070
how to get people's attention.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.377
-Evie.

20:48.421 --> 20:53.208
COLIN:
Whether it be fainting
or car troubles.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.297
A lot of things happen

20:55.341 --> 20:57.778
to her and her cat.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.127
♪ Someone...♪

20:59.170 --> 21:01.216
EVIE:
As many of you know,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.218
I've been paying out of pocket

21:03.262 --> 21:05.351
for my cat's glaucoma treatment,

21:05.394 --> 21:10.225
and the expenses have
entirely wiped my savings.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.748
COLIN:
Since I've met her, she's had

21:11.792 --> 21:14.316
at least six pairs
of grandparents die.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.885
...looks like I'm gonna be
sleeping in my cubicle

21:17.928 --> 21:20.975
-until further notice.
-No...

21:21.018 --> 21:23.717
I asked my boyfriend, Colin,
if I could stay with him.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.545
ARNIE:
What did he say?

21:25.588 --> 21:27.329
EVIE:
He said he's not
ready f-for that.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.418
ARNIE:
Oh, my God.

21:29.462 --> 21:32.378
EVIE:I haven't used that credit cardin six months.

21:32.421 --> 21:33.683
I'll call you back.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.381
Oh.

21:35.424 --> 21:38.427
-Hi, Evie.
-Hi.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.389
Um, listen,

21:43.432 --> 21:46.479
these last few weeks
have been wonderful.

21:46.522 --> 21:49.046
I, uh... I didn't know

21:49.090 --> 21:52.615
I could feel such depth
of emotion.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.836
Or utter, utter suffering.

21:55.879 --> 21:59.274
But I don't think
this is healthy.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.582
-Oh, Colin.
-I-I'm sorry.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.367
I wish you nothing
but continued success

22:05.411 --> 22:08.544
feeding on
the addle-brained cattle

22:08.588 --> 22:11.155
that waste
their lives around us,

22:11.199 --> 22:15.595
but I can't be around us
any-anymore.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.597
If you leave me, I'll...

22:17.640 --> 22:19.425
I'll kill myself.

22:19.468 --> 22:22.471
I'll do it. I don't have
anything to live for

22:22.515 --> 22:23.864
if I don't have you.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.562
That's not true.
You do, Evie.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.999
You have so much more life

22:29.043 --> 22:31.611
to take out of these morons.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.352
Come here,
we'll figure this out.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.880
Y-You couldn't help yourself,
could you?

22:39.923 --> 22:42.491
I just wanted one last taste.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.276
Goodbye, Evie Russell.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.627
Goodbye, Colin Robinson.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.109
Colin, don't leave me.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.461
I'm just kidding, you can...

22:55.504 --> 22:57.550
Colin.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.987
You can go.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.468
Please.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.513
But...

23:07.124 --> 23:10.084
Hi. I'm sorry, my boyfriend
just broke up with me.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.783
Yes, I'm calling
about my dry cleaning.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.482
There we are, Mother.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.048
You're looking beautiful again.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.486
Or, as Beethoven used to say,

23:20.529 --> 23:23.663
"Die Busche werden
sich nicht schneiden."

23:23.706 --> 23:26.622
These bushes
won't trim themselves.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.102
But there, again--
