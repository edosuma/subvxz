WEBVTT

00:11.527 --> 00:15.396
OH, MY GOD. WHOA.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN UGLY.

00:15.464 --> 00:16.948
ARTHUR, GET UP.

00:17.016 --> 00:19.150
I NEED THE COUCH.
GO DOWN TO BED.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:32.548 --> 00:33.598
ALL RIGHT.

00:33.665 --> 00:35.416
THERE.

00:35.484 --> 00:38.520
YEAH.

00:38.587 --> 00:39.654
MMM.

00:58.925 --> 01:00.625
HELLO?

01:00.692 --> 01:02.093
OH, HI, MISS CONRAD.

01:02.161 --> 01:04.129
YES, I'M PULLING
THE LISTINGS RIGHT NOW.

01:04.196 --> 01:06.631
AND LISTEN, I WANT TO THANK
YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

01:06.698 --> 01:09.000
I WON'T LET YOU-WHAT?

01:09.068 --> 01:11.702
AM I USING
THE T.R.D. REPORTS?

01:11.770 --> 01:13.905
OF COURSE.
I HAVE THEM RIGHT HERE.

01:13.973 --> 01:15.974
I- I'M ALL ABOUT
THE T.R.D.s.

01:16.042 --> 01:19.077
OK. ALL RIGHT,
NO PROBLEM. BYE-BYE.

01:19.145 --> 01:21.346
OH, MY GOD. I HOPE
I LEFT THEM IN THE BATHROOM.

01:23.266 --> 01:26.584
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
LET'S PLAY SOME CARDS.

01:26.652 --> 01:29.387
DANNY, YOU GET THE BEER.
SPENCE, HERE.

01:29.455 --> 01:30.572
ORDER UP SOME CHINESE.
YEAH.

01:30.639 --> 01:32.607
DEAC
- TUNES, I'M RIGHT ON IT.

01:32.674 --> 01:34.409
OH, HEY.
INSTEAD OF TUNG SING,

01:34.476 --> 01:37.311
LET'S TRY SZECHUAN VILLAGE.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AMAZING.

01:37.379 --> 01:38.346
AS LONG AS THEY CAN
MAKE MY DISH.

01:38.414 --> 01:40.464
BEEF WITH BROCCOLI.
WITH?

01:40.532 --> 01:42.049
NO BROCCOLI.

01:49.074 --> 01:52.560
HEY. BIG JAR OF HONEY
TIPPED OVER IN YOUR FRIDGE.

01:55.264 --> 01:57.398
WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED HERE?

01:57.466 --> 01:58.549
WHAT? WE'RE
PLAYING POKER.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.518
AND COULD YOU WATCH THE
LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF MY COMPANY?

02:00.585 --> 02:02.721
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

02:02.788 --> 02:04.021
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:04.089 --> 02:05.790
DOUG, I NEED THIS ROOM
TO WORK, OK?

02:05.858 --> 02:07.992
WE HAVE A BIG CLIENT
FLYING IN FROM L.A.

02:08.060 --> 02:11.329
I HAVE TO PULL ALL THE LISTINGS
OF OUR CONDOS, CO-OPS, LOFTS,

02:11.397 --> 02:14.366
THEN I HAVE TO PROJECT WHAT
THE AMORTIZED MORTGAGE WOULD BE-

02:14.433 --> 02:16.167
OK, IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO BORE US INTO LEAVING,

02:16.235 --> 02:18.536
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

02:18.604 --> 02:20.722
DOUG, PLEASE, COME ON.

02:20.790 --> 02:21.939
WHERE ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO GO?

02:22.007 --> 02:23.241
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE GARAGE?

02:23.309 --> 02:26.026
AGAIN, THERE'S A RACCOON
LIVING IN IT.

02:26.094 --> 02:29.363
MY PLACE IS NO GOOD.
THE KIDS ARE STILL UP.

02:29.431 --> 02:30.665
YEAH,
WE'RE OUT, TOO.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.967
SPENCE'S MOM HAS A DATE OVER AGAIN.

02:33.035 --> 02:36.388
LOWELL ISN'T A DATE.
HE'S HER PIANO TEACHER.

02:36.455 --> 02:38.639
WE DON'T HAVE A PIANO.

02:38.707 --> 02:40.875
HELLO?
HE BRINGS HIS ORGAN,

02:40.942 --> 02:43.344
AND SHE PRACTICES
ON THAT.

02:49.551 --> 02:52.370
COME ON, HONEY, PLEASE. I
REALLY WANT TO DO A GOOD JOB.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.038
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

02:54.106 --> 02:55.390
OK, FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT,
GUYS? NO CARDS. LET'S-

02:55.458 --> 02:57.192
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST
GO TO SZECHUAN VILLAGE.

02:57.259 --> 02:58.860
ALL RIGHT?
OH, AND F.Y.I...

02:58.927 --> 03:01.496
WHEN YOU'RE AMBITIOUS,
I COULDN'T WANT YOU LESS.

03:01.563 --> 03:02.830
OK?

03:11.257 --> 03:13.341
ALL RIGHT, SO,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

03:13.409 --> 03:14.742
HIT ME.

03:14.810 --> 03:16.076
DAMN IT!

03:16.144 --> 03:17.979
CAN WE BE DONE NOW?

03:18.047 --> 03:20.115
OH, GOD, WHEN DID YOU
BECOME SUCH A COMPLAINER?

03:20.182 --> 03:22.917
UH, WHENEVER I'M FORCED
TO BE FURNITURE.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.001
YOU KNOW WHAT? DEAL 'EM UP. COME ON.

03:24.069 --> 03:25.487
NAH, I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY ANYMORE.

03:25.521 --> 03:29.840
I'M GETTIN' TOO GOOD A VIEW
OF BACKSTAGE SPENCE.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.309
IS THAT A THONG?

03:31.377 --> 03:32.676
WHAT?! NO.

03:32.744 --> 03:34.678
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?
HEH.

03:36.148 --> 03:38.650
SO, WE GETTIN' A TABLE
ANYTIME SOON?

03:38.717 --> 03:40.919
WELL, GOOD NEWS IS, THERE'S A CHINESE
FAMILY THAT JUST FINISHED EATING.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.788
BAD NEWS IS, THEY STARTED PLAYING
SOME KIND OF GAME WITH TILES.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.456
OH, GOD, I HOPE
IT'S NOT SHOGI.

03:45.524 --> 03:46.858
THAT COULD
TAKE HOURS.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.793
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WHY DON'T
WE JUST GRAB SOME TAKEOUT

03:48.861 --> 03:50.261
AND GO PLAY
IN THE GARAGE?

03:50.329 --> 03:52.263
AS LONG AS WE DON'T MESS
WITH THE RACCOON BABIES,

03:52.331 --> 03:54.699
THE MOTHER IS NOT
GOING TO ATTACK US.

03:54.767 --> 03:58.085
OK, I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:58.153 --> 04:00.388
BESIDES, I WANT TO PLAY
IN MY OWN LIVING ROOM.

04:00.455 --> 04:02.289
WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN. CARRIE'S THROWN US OUT

04:02.357 --> 04:03.791
THE LAST 5 TIMES
WE'VE TRIED.

04:03.859 --> 04:06.144
YOU KNOW, IF WE HAD ANY
GUTS, WE'D RENT OUT THAT PLACE

04:06.211 --> 04:08.162
AND MAKE IT OUR
PERMANENT POKER ROOM.

04:08.230 --> 04:12.199
HEH. PLUS, HOW FAST WOULD
THE CHINESE FOOD COME?

04:12.267 --> 04:14.452
YEAH, THAT'D BE
OFF THE HOOK.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.070
<i>OFF THE HOOK...</i>

04:16.137 --> 04:19.039
<i>OR VERY MUCH
ON THE HOOK?</i>

04:22.344 --> 04:23.745
THE LOCATION IS GOOD-

04:23.812 --> 04:26.114
CLOSE TO SHOPPING.
SCHOOLS ARE EXCELLENT.

04:26.181 --> 04:27.514
THE BLINDS ARE NEW.

04:27.582 --> 04:30.418
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW PUT THEM UP
JUST BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY.

04:30.485 --> 04:32.087
DROPPED DEAD.

04:32.154 --> 04:34.288
DROPPED DEAD RIGHT WHERE
YOU ARE STANDING.

04:36.725 --> 04:38.092
HER HEART?

04:38.160 --> 04:41.779
NO, UH, THE CEILING FAN
CAME DOWN ON HER.

04:41.847 --> 04:43.948
IT'S IN THERE
PRETTY GOOD NOW, THOUGH.

04:49.304 --> 04:51.656
I HAD BETTER GET BACK
DOWN TO MY RESTAURANT.

04:51.723 --> 04:53.358
ANYTHING ELSE?

04:53.425 --> 04:54.559
UH, HOW MUCH
IS THE RENT AGAIN?

04:54.626 --> 04:56.995
$800 A MONTH,
INCLUDING UTILITIES.

04:57.062 --> 04:58.362
NO PETS.

04:58.430 --> 05:01.065
CAT GETS LOOSE IN
A CHINESE RESTAURANT, AND...

05:01.133 --> 05:03.134
WELL, THAT'S HARD
TO LIVE DOWN.

05:07.606 --> 05:10.308
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
GUYS THINK?

05:10.376 --> 05:12.209
I'M NOT SURE
KELLY'S GONNA GO FOR IT.

05:12.277 --> 05:16.981
SHE CAN'T NOT GO FOR WHAT
SHE DOESN'T NOT KNOW ABOUT.

05:17.049 --> 05:19.049
WHAT?

05:19.117 --> 05:19.901
YOU DON'T TELL HER!

05:20.052 --> 05:21.352
OH, WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL CARRIE?

05:21.420 --> 05:24.004
HELL TO THE NO.

05:24.072 --> 05:26.006
BROADS AIN'T HEARIN'
ABOUT THIS,

05:26.074 --> 05:28.743
AND BROADS DEFINITELY
AIN'T INVITED.

05:28.811 --> 05:30.895
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M IN.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.764
YEAH, ME, TOO.
SPENCE?

05:32.832 --> 05:35.333
THE, UH,
"NO BROADS" POLICY-

05:35.400 --> 05:37.668
LIKE, SAY I MEET
A HOT CHICK IN A BAR,

05:37.737 --> 05:38.937
I WANT TO
BRING HER UP HERE.

05:39.004 --> 05:41.606
I MEAN, WOULD THAT
BE OK, OR NO?

05:41.673 --> 05:43.374
LET'S CROSS THAT
IMAGINARY BRIDGE

05:43.442 --> 05:45.443
WHEN WE COME TO IT.

05:53.185 --> 05:55.753
WE GOTTA HUSTLE. CARRIE'S
GONNA BE HOME ANY MINUTE.

05:55.821 --> 05:57.922
YOU WANNA BRING
THIS GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL?

05:57.990 --> 05:59.924
MMM. NAW.
AT THE NEW PLACE,

05:59.991 --> 06:02.260
LET'S LEAVE ANIMAL
FAT WHERE IT BELONGS-

06:02.327 --> 06:04.728
IN THE FOOD.

06:04.796 --> 06:06.781
HEY!
HEY!

06:06.849 --> 06:09.583
HI, DEACON, WHY DO YOU
HAVE FOLDING CHAIRS

06:09.651 --> 06:11.469
TIED TO THE ROOF
OF YOUR CAR?

06:11.536 --> 06:14.371
OH, UH... I-IT'S FOR
MY KID.

06:14.439 --> 06:17.575
HE LIKES MUSICAL CHAIRS.
HE'S-

06:17.643 --> 06:20.478
HE'S TRYING OUT
FOR THE TEAM AT SCHOOL.

06:24.516 --> 06:27.284
THAT'S A GOOD DAD
RIGHT THERE.

06:27.352 --> 06:29.554
ANYWAY, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT CLIENT FROM L.A.

06:29.622 --> 06:32.157
I WAS GONNA BE SHOWING
PROPERTIES TO?

06:32.224 --> 06:33.707
NO.

06:33.775 --> 06:35.710
WELL, I DID, AND I AM.

06:35.777 --> 06:37.946
ANYWAY, GUESS WHO IT IS.
BIG STAR.

06:38.013 --> 06:39.613
TOM HANKS.
NO.

06:39.681 --> 06:41.849
THE GUY WHO PLAYED
MR. DRUMMOND.

06:43.052 --> 06:43.985
NO!
I'M OUT.

06:44.053 --> 06:45.987
ALL RIGHT.
KIRSTIE ALLEY.

06:46.055 --> 06:48.622
OH! GIMME A CALL
WHEN IT'S MR. D.

06:48.690 --> 06:50.558
HEY, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

06:50.625 --> 06:55.429
UH-NO, THIS IS JUST STUFF THAT
I-I'M GOING TO SELL ON eBAY.

06:55.497 --> 06:57.699
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

06:57.766 --> 07:01.903
HONEY, YOU'RE SELLING YOUR
PLAYSTATION? YOU LOVE IT.

07:01.970 --> 07:04.956
EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY I'M
GETTING RID OF ALL THIS CRAP,

07:05.023 --> 07:08.258
SO I CAN SPEND
MORE TIME WITH YOU.

07:09.695 --> 07:12.246
TO DO WHAT?

07:12.314 --> 07:13.547
I GOT NOTHIN'

07:15.784 --> 07:17.685
HEY, HEY, SLOW DOWN

07:17.753 --> 07:20.054
HERE. SELL THIS
FOR ME.

07:20.122 --> 07:22.840
A POTATO CHIP.

07:22.907 --> 07:27.061
NOT JUST A POTATO CHIP. A POTATO CHIP
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE RICHARD NIXON.

07:27.129 --> 07:28.813
NO ONE'S GONNA BUY THAT.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.698
ARE YOU CRAZY?
IT'S A KNOWN FACT

07:30.766 --> 07:34.502
THAT NIXON IS THE ROLLS-ROYCE OF
PRESIDENTIAL-SHAPED POTATO CHIPS!

07:36.638 --> 07:39.339
IT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE HIM! IT
LOOKS... MORE LIKE MY UNCLE STU.

07:39.407 --> 07:42.576
YOUR UNCLE STU
WISHES! HERE.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.853
HI. ARE YOU CARRIE?

07:52.922 --> 07:54.122
YES. HI!

07:54.189 --> 07:55.355
I'M KIRSTIE ALLEY.

07:55.423 --> 07:56.574
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
CATCH THE NAME.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.858
AH! KIDDING!

07:57.926 --> 07:59.193
HELLO, WELCOME!
COME IN!

07:59.261 --> 08:01.462
I HAVE SOME GREAT CONDOS
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT.

08:01.529 --> 08:03.597
OH, EXCITING.
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

08:03.665 --> 08:05.800
I'M RELIEVED THAT I'M GONNA
BE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING

08:05.868 --> 08:07.601
OTHER THAN
MY WEIGHT LOSS.

08:07.669 --> 08:09.687
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, "KIRSTIE,
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

08:09.754 --> 08:12.723
YOU LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT!
OH, YOU LOOK SO HOT."

08:12.791 --> 08:15.859
AT A CERTAIN POINT IT'S
LIKE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, RIGHT?

08:15.927 --> 08:17.945
ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T
REACHED THAT POINT.

08:18.013 --> 08:21.232
OH, IF I HADN'T TOLD YOU,
KIRSTIE, YOU LOOK FABULOUS!

08:21.299 --> 08:23.033
WELL, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.718
HEY, JENNY CRAIG FOR PRESIDENT
- AM I RIGHT?

08:24.786 --> 08:25.603
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.388
SO WHY DON'T WE
GET STARTED?

08:27.456 --> 08:28.723
LET'S!

08:28.791 --> 08:30.591
MS. HEFFERNAN, WHERE DO
YOU WANT, BAGELS AND DONUTS?

08:30.659 --> 08:33.494
UH... THANK YOU.
YOU CAN PUT THEM-

08:33.561 --> 08:36.380
RIGHT BACK WHERE
THEY CAME FROM!

08:36.448 --> 08:38.799
WE DON'T WANT THAT
POISON IN HERE!

08:38.866 --> 08:40.049
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
KIRSTIE.

08:40.118 --> 08:41.936
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

08:42.004 --> 08:44.389
PLEASE. PLEASE,
YOU ENJOY, CARRIE.

08:44.456 --> 08:48.526
I AM PERFECTLY ABLE TO SIT
HERE AND WATCH OTHER PEOPLE EAT.

08:48.593 --> 08:49.543
OK. HA HA. ALL RIGHT.

08:51.946 --> 08:53.614
Out. Out.

09:02.674 --> 09:04.875
IS IT GOOD?

09:05.894 --> 09:07.061
MM-HMM.

09:09.415 --> 09:12.216
IS THAT A LITTLE
PECAN ON TOP?

09:12.284 --> 09:14.101
OH, ACTUALLY,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

09:14.169 --> 09:16.037
JUST GIVE A LITTLE
TASTE.

09:16.104 --> 09:17.171
OK.

09:19.507 --> 09:21.109
PECAN?

09:21.176 --> 09:23.144
MM-HMM. MM-HMM. I THINK
SO. I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

09:23.211 --> 09:24.711
I'M NOT SURE.

09:24.779 --> 09:26.597
OH, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY!
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

09:26.665 --> 09:29.133
I HAVE THIS LITTLE TRICK-I
WATCH OTHER PEOPLE EAT,

09:29.200 --> 09:31.335
AND THEN I ENJOY
THE FOOD THROUGH THEM.

09:31.402 --> 09:33.988
OH! OH, I GET IT.
OK, GREAT, GREAT.

09:34.056 --> 09:37.074
IN FACT, YOU SEE THAT LITTLE
SPRINKLED DONUT OVER THERE?

09:37.142 --> 09:38.075
UH-HUH.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.261
COULD YOU EAT THAT?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.512
ACTUALLY, I DON'T
LOVE SPRINKLES-

09:41.579 --> 09:42.830
BUT COULD YOU EAT IT?

09:42.898 --> 09:44.431
ABSOLUTELY. I CAN.
ABSOLUTELY.

09:44.499 --> 09:46.033
NOT A PROBLEM.

09:55.811 --> 09:57.344
AHH...

09:57.412 --> 09:59.947
THIS IS LIVIN'.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.173
OH HO! THERE IT IS!
STILL THE CHAMP!

10:09.240 --> 10:10.708
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
IT'S ON THE LINE!

10:10.776 --> 10:13.010
LOOK, NOBODY LIKES
LOSING AT BALONEY DARTS,

10:13.078 --> 10:14.745
BUT SHOW A LITTLE CLASS,
WOULD YA?

10:21.903 --> 10:23.470
HELLO.

10:23.538 --> 10:24.939
HEY, IT'S ME.

10:25.006 --> 10:26.390
IT'S CARRIE.
KEEP IT DOWN.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.510
LISTEN, WHERE ARE YOU?
I TRIED CALLING YOU AT HOME.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.345
I'M AT SZECHUAN VILLAGE.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.681
AGAIN? MAN,

10:47.462 --> 10:49.396
WOW. I'M IN THE WRONG
BUSINESS.

10:51.032 --> 10:54.835

10:56.621 --> 10:58.722

13:05.250 --> 13:08.034

15:23.371 --> 15:25.639
KIRSTIE, THAT CONDO
WAS PERFECT FOR YOU.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.308
I'M NEVER BUYING A CONDO

15:27.375 --> 15:29.926
<i>FROM SOME IDIOT WHO SAYS I
WAS GREAT IN CAGNEY & LACEY.</i>

15:29.994 --> 15:32.163
I DON'T EVEN WANT
A CONDOMINIUM ANYMORE.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.131

15:35.733 --> 15:38.669

15:46.078 --> 15:48.028

15:48.180 --> 15:52.383

15:52.450 --> 15:54.802

16:12.104 --> 16:15.606

16:25.617 --> 16:28.552

A DELIVERY.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.280
I'M JUST
A LITTLE CONFUSED.

17:29.347 --> 17:31.949
IS IT YOUR POLICY TO JUST
DUMP THE FOOD IN THE STREET

17:32.017 --> 17:33.650
AND THEN DRIVE OFF?

17:33.718 --> 17:36.236
I ASK IN BACK.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.447

18:44.338 --> 18:46.106
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
ABOUT THIS?

18:46.173 --> 18:49.042
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
HANGOUT, YOU KNOW.

18:49.110 --> 18:52.212
I COME HERE TO UNWIND...
LIKE ONCE IN A BLUE MOON.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.363
AHEM.

AND YOU HAVE A TURTLE AND THROW
PILLOWS THAT SAY "HOME SWEET HOME."

19:02.890 --> 19:05.242

A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

19:05.309 --> 19:07.377

A HOUSEWARMING PARTY?!

19:07.445 --> 19:11.014

19:13.200 --> 19:14.735
I MEAN, YOU HAVE

19:14.803 --> 19:16.804

19:16.871 --> 19:18.154

19:18.222 --> 19:19.406

19:19.473 --> 19:22.142

19:23.628 --> 19:26.363

19:50.672 --> 19:53.874
<i>OH, YEAH. HERE

19:53.941 --> 19:55.642
JUST LISTEN TO ME,

19:55.710 --> 19:59.512
THIS WHOLE THING STARTED AS A PLACE
FOR ME AND THE GUYS TO HANG OUT.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.581
BUT... THEY BAILED OUT
AND I JUST...

20:01.649 --> 20:03.616
I STAYED WITH IT.

20:03.684 --> 20:05.852
WHY? TO GET AWAY
FROM ME?

20:05.920 --> 20:07.438
NOT YOU.

20:07.505 --> 20:10.207
NOT JUST YOU.

20:10.275 --> 20:13.744
LOOK, I ADMIT, MAYBE I TOOK
THINGS A LITTLE TOO FAR.

20:13.811 --> 20:16.447
BUT HAVE YOU EVER JUST...

20:16.514 --> 20:18.582
WANTED TO ESCAPE
FROM SOMEONE?

DECIDED TO STAY.

20:45.559 --> 20:49.295
HEY, YOU WANNA...

I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW

20:54.568 --> 20:56.002
BUT NO.
