00:27.743 --> 00:29.409
I guess you could call him our leader.

00:29.411 --> 00:31.277
I can't believe my

a way to find the Refuge...

You lied to them.

It's about my dad. He's alive. I saw him.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.587
Same way you did.

Does he know about your powers?

02:10.475 --> 02:11.941
Yeah, why?

02:11.943 --> 02:13.643
If he uses you the way he tried to use me

02:13.645 --> 02:15.246
then it's not just our species in peril.

You have to find Simon Plame.

Why don't you come back with me?

02:21.553 --> 02:23.485
I can't. Not until you find my body.

- You have to go. Now.
- Why...

02:24.923 --> 02:26.755
Find Simon Plame. He'll explain everything.

(BREATHING HEAVILY) It's being

Hey, take it easy.

02:46.977 --> 02:49.645
Find his body, like dig him up?

I don't know.

02:53.718 --> 02:55.999
You guys pulled me out before
I could get the whole story.

02:57.353 --> 02:58.820
Stephen, you were technically dead.

02:58.822 --> 03:00.262
How can you be sure of what you saw?

Okay, check my memory.

Sorry, Stephen, I can't see anything.

This wasn't some figment
of my imagination, okay?

03:16.803 --> 03:20.004
Where would the name
Simon Plame have come from?

03:20.006 --> 03:21.539
Maybe you heard it somewhere.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.841
Yeah, just now, from my dad.

03:24.023 --> 03:27.257
Cara, we have to be open to the
possibility that the experiment worked.

04:18.809 --> 04:21.243

- Something to drink?
- Uh, water, please.

04:49.171 --> 04:52.073
Hello? Could you be less psyched for Mom?

04:52.075 --> 04:53.674
I'm psyched for her.

Dad. What if he comes home?

05:02.685 --> 05:04.118
Really?

05:04.120 --> 05:06.320
We don't know, he could walk
through that door any day.

05:32.079 --> 05:33.646
- Thanks, Morgan.
- You got it.

05:40.354 --> 05:43.790
Look, I understand Stephen is desperate
to believe his father is still alive,

05:43.792 --> 05:45.925
but you, of all people, should
not be giving him false hope.

05:45.927 --> 05:48.728
Stephen is going to do what he wants to do.

05:48.730 --> 05:50.396
Regardless of what we think.

05:50.398 --> 05:51.997
If Roger was still out there,

05:51.999 --> 05:55.100
I would have seen it when
I read Stephen's mind.

05:55.102 --> 05:59.038
Roger was the only one who could
have turned the tide in this war.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.140
If there is any possibility
that he is out there...

06:01.142 --> 06:02.274
And you killed him.

06:03.443 --> 06:05.277
And then you lied about it to all of us.

06:06.913 --> 06:08.380
And now, worst of all?

06:08.382 --> 06:10.316
You're taking advantage
of Stephen's vulnerability

06:10.318 --> 06:11.984
to make yourself feel better.

06:11.986 --> 06:14.719
I believe that Stephen saw his father.

06:14.721 --> 06:17.188
Even if Stephen has forgiven you,

06:17.190 --> 06:19.758
it doesn't mean that your
sins have been erased.

06:24.029 --> 06:25.964
You're right.

06:25.966 --> 06:27.899
You're absolutely right.

06:27.901 --> 06:29.334
I've been lying for way too long.

06:31.770 --> 06:33.171

No, John!

Cara, they deserve to know who I really am.

06:37.910 --> 06:40.111
I deserve to know and
look what happened to us.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.747
What do you think the others will do

06:43.749 --> 06:45.950
when they find out that you've
been lying all this time?

06:47.919 --> 06:49.753

he saw enemies where there were friends.

10:09.801 --> 10:11.868
He was a threat to himself and your family.

If that was true, then maybe
Simon Plame can confirm it.

Errol, I'm unarmed. Just let her go.

you see I'm like you?</i>

You lied to us.

12:33.506 --> 12:35.607
I know I let you all down.

12:35.609 --> 12:37.543
But most of all, I let Roger down.

12:39.179 --> 12:42.181
Stephen believes that his
father is stuck in limbo.

12:42.183 --> 12:43.248
So do I.

12:44.284 --> 12:45.884
So from here on out,

12:45.886 --> 12:49.555
I promise to do everything
in my power to find him.

12:49.557 --> 12:52.558
You're just an Ultra freak who can kill.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.559
Why should we even let
you stay in the lair?

12:54.561 --> 12:56.227
That is not up for debate.

12:56.229 --> 12:58.763
It's not like John volunteered for Ultra.

12:58.765 --> 13:02.167
He was captured, lied to, experimented on.

13:02.169 --> 13:04.268
All so Jedikiah could
turn him into a weapon.

13:04.270 --> 13:06.370
I don't need you to defend me, Cara.

13:06.372 --> 13:08.533
'Cause you're doing such a
good job defending yourself?

13:10.275 --> 13:11.542
John made a mistake.

13:11.544 --> 13:13.411
Now he's asking for your forgiveness.

13:14.779 --> 13:16.714
Nothing's changed.

13:16.716 --> 13:18.416
Except now we know where Roger is.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.418
Stuck in some freaky spirit world.

13:20.420 --> 13:21.452
Yeah, says John.

13:23.154 --> 13:26.156
- The guy that shot him.
- What's going on?

13:26.158 --> 13:27.691
- Don't ask.
- MIKE: Come on, guys.

13:27.693 --> 13:29.626
Why should we even trust this guy anymore?

13:31.662 --> 13:33.931
- Where have you been?
- Don't ask.

13:33.933 --> 13:37.835
I am telling you all this, so that
we can start over with a clean slate.

13:37.837 --> 13:40.738
Until we find Roger, you're stuck with me.

13:40.740 --> 13:43.140
- My leadership...
- MIKE: Are you sure about that?

13:43.142 --> 13:45.642
Anyone can lead if they
get more votes than you.

13:48.779 --> 13:50.847
Are you going to challenge me, Mike?

13:50.849 --> 13:53.583
- No.
- I didn't think so.

13:53.585 --> 13:55.318
I nominate Cara.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.854
- What? No!
- MIKE: Yes, yes, yes.

13:57.856 --> 13:59.656

My vote's for him.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.835
MIKE: Well, well, well.

15:22.170 --> 15:23.670
Looks like we have a new leader.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.271
(ALL CHEERING)

15:27.642 --> 15:29.476
John, I swear, I didn't
want this to happen.

15:33.147 --> 15:34.748
But you got it.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.749
Good luck.

<i>Jedikiah said that Errol was

15:50.992 --> 15:52.652
at an off-site Ultra facility.

15:56.590 --> 15:57.924
What?

15:57.926 --> 15:59.191
It's called the Citadel.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.629
I thought that...

16:02.631 --> 16:05.631
I thought that place was made up.
Like some Tomorrow Person boogie man.

16:09.737 --> 16:12.771
all in the name of testing
the limits on our powers.

In some cases, expanding our powers.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.644
When I was inside Errol's mind, he...

16:18.646 --> 16:20.613
he did this thing, he...

16:20.615 --> 16:22.147
Forced me out of his head.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.883
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING)

16:26.330 --> 16:27.263
He pushed you.

16:29.233 --> 16:31.568
Only the most powerful telepaths can do it.

16:31.570 --> 16:33.937
Must be why Jedikiah
used him as a guinea pig.

16:33.939 --> 16:35.405
That guy is lucky.

16:35.407 --> 16:37.773
No one's ever escaped the Citadel.

16:37.775 --> 16:38.941
Or broken in.

16:40.611 --> 16:42.111
First, we find Errol.

16:42.113 --> 16:44.514
Then, we get him to lead us
to Jedikiah's house of horrors.

16:46.217 --> 16:48.284
Errol is right here, right
now, and he can lead us

16:48.286 --> 16:52.488
to a facility full of people just
like us who are being experimented on.

16:52.490 --> 16:56.225
That's more than we can save in a whole
year of tracking individual breakouts.

16:56.227 --> 16:58.260
JOHN: She's right, Stephen.

16:58.262 --> 17:02.264
This is the first real lead we've
ever had on finding the Citadel.

17:02.266 --> 17:04.599
Okay, but it's easier said than done.

17:04.602 --> 17:06.501
Ultra's going to be all over this guy.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.871
And you are going to be all over Ultra.

17:08.873 --> 17:11.473
The minute they get a bead on
him, I want to hear from you.

17:13.309 --> 17:15.477
We're turning up the heat
on Jedikiah. Starting now.

<i>MARLA: Okay, so I'll be home around 10.</i>

17:21.084 --> 17:23.551

lasagna out, to turn off the oven.

Mom, we know how to get the lasagna out

17:25.289 --> 17:26.655
without burning the house down.

17:26.656 --> 17:28.823
I know. Okay, how do I look?

If he has vanity license
plates, I am ending this.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.466
I told him to honk because I wasn't sure

17:38.468 --> 17:40.701
if I was ready for the
streams to cross just yet.

- What are you doing?

17:46.576 --> 17:48.276
- Inviting him in.
- No.

17:48.278 --> 17:50.411
Yes, see how he holds
up under a little heat.

17:50.413 --> 17:52.513
(SIGHING) Look, you
guys, I know this is weird

17:52.515 --> 17:53.947
to see your mom go on a date.

But I want you to know, whatever happens,

17:56.319 --> 17:58.486
you two always come first.

Okay?

Hey, uh... Peter.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.190

- All right.

- Uh, this is my brother...
- Stephen, of course.

18:06.695 --> 18:08.796
Sorry about the honking.

18:08.798 --> 18:10.230
Your mom's idea.

18:10.232 --> 18:12.332
I guess she didn't want
us three to cross streams.

18:13.902 --> 18:15.903
<i>Uh... Ghostbusters?</i>

18:15.905 --> 18:17.771

- Yeah, they got it.

- Yeah, you too, Pete.

When Ultra captures Errol,

18:35.290 --> 18:37.256
they'll bring him back to the
mothership in one of these.

18:37.258 --> 18:38.490
Once they're on the move,

18:38.492 --> 18:40.259
Stephen will let us know timing and route.

18:43.297 --> 18:44.898
- And then what?
- We'll take it from there.

Your uncle can't suspect an ambush.

The best way for you to act
surprised is to be surprised.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.719
That's the plan.

19:07.721 --> 19:10.722
I thought the plan was to find my dad.

19:10.724 --> 19:14.392
Right, I'm sorry. You don't
believe I can bring him back.

19:14.394 --> 19:17.395
Honestly, I don't know what I believe.

19:17.397 --> 19:19.597
But I think you're so invested
in the idea of bringing him back

19:19.599 --> 19:22.234
that you've lost sight
of our other priorities.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.168
Look, I get it. He's your dad, but...

19:24.170 --> 19:27.271
I have to do what I think
is best for all of us.

19:27.273 --> 19:28.740
Right now, that's finding Errol.

19:28.742 --> 19:30.375

19:32.210 --> 19:33.711
Yes, of course you can.

- It's okay.
- No, really. What the hell are you doing?

Jedikiah needs to believe
this was a legit ambush.

21:15.557 --> 21:16.723
The only way he won't
question what happened...

21:16.725 --> 21:17.790
Is if you take a bullet.

- Hold still, will you?
- You're enjoying this, aren't you?

21:58.768 --> 22:00.834
I have to say, I'm a little bit relieved.

22:00.836 --> 22:02.269
That I'm not dead?

22:02.271 --> 22:05.205
No. That you took a bullet for Ultra.

22:05.207 --> 22:06.306
Literally.

24:35.673 --> 24:38.649
the Citadel must be
located within this zone.

24:39.535 --> 24:40.669
What else do you remember?

24:40.671 --> 24:42.237
I've blocked most of it out.

24:43.606 --> 24:44.673
Here.

24:47.176 --> 24:48.309
Let me remember for you.

25:02.524 --> 25:04.057
(SCREAMING)

25:07.696 --> 25:08.696
I see a doctor.

25:10.632 --> 25:11.666
What else?

25:15.737 --> 25:18.673
In his coat, there's a folded newspaper.

25:18.675 --> 25:20.373
Does the newspaper have a name?

25:26.214 --> 25:27.948
All I'm getting is N-E-W.

25:27.950 --> 25:30.150
<i>TIM: There are 19 New York
and Connecticut dailies</i>

25:30.152 --> 25:32.252
<i>starting with the prefix "new."</i>

25:32.254 --> 25:34.087

25:37.753 --> 25:39.793
(YELLING AND SCREAMING) I
don't want to go to the...

25:42.330 --> 25:43.797
Please, don't make me go!

25:43.799 --> 25:45.131
Stay with me, Errol.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.300
What else is inside that cell?

25:51.238 --> 25:52.319
What's outside that window?

25:56.176 --> 25:58.110
(MUMBLING) No more.

25:58.112 --> 25:59.445
It's okay. You did great.

26:01.414 --> 26:03.515
I saw an apple orchard.

26:09.390 --> 26:10.723
Tell the team to suit up.

26:10.725 --> 26:11.724
On it.

26:13.660 --> 26:15.461
JOHN: You already scored big.

26:15.463 --> 26:18.697
I mean, I wish I'd have thought
to hijack an Ultra transport.

26:19.766 --> 26:23.101
But Jedikiah's antennae are way up.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.703
Maybe we should just take a beat.

26:25.705 --> 26:29.574
The longer we wait, the more time
Jedikiah has to put reinforcements in.

26:29.576 --> 26:32.410
You didn't see what I saw
inside Errol's head, John.

26:32.412 --> 26:35.413
People are being tortured as we speak.

26:35.415 --> 26:38.649
- It's aggressive.
- It is a calculated risk.

26:38.651 --> 26:40.785
I'm not going to back away
from what I think is right.

26:40.787 --> 26:43.120
And the people out there,
they need this to happen.

26:43.122 --> 26:44.489
And so do the people down here.

26:45.557 --> 26:47.825
I need you to have my back.

26:47.827 --> 26:49.494
I do.

26:49.496 --> 26:52.062
But you're talking about
breaking in to the Citadel.

26:53.331 --> 26:55.099
Which is why I want you to stay here.

26:56.535 --> 26:58.102
You and Tim will be my eyes and ears.

26:58.104 --> 27:00.437
While you risk your life. No way.

27:00.439 --> 27:03.607
How many times did you run
point while I manned the screens?

27:03.609 --> 27:06.810
Besides, I need somebody to guard Morgan.

27:06.812 --> 27:09.079
This plan goes sideways, she's
our "get out of jail free" card.

27:09.081 --> 27:10.080
You mean hostage?

27:11.682 --> 27:13.884
Collateral.

27:13.886 --> 27:18.254
She's Jedikiah's weak spot and
I will use her if I have to.

27:18.256 --> 27:21.458
The Annex Project? What
that man did to you?

27:21.460 --> 27:24.360
I am not letting another
one of us suffer that fate.

27:28.399 --> 27:30.567
JEDIKIAH: No sign of
Chasen or his kidnappers?

27:30.569 --> 27:33.102
It's quiet out there,
wouldn't worry about it.

27:33.104 --> 27:35.071
Errol's practically a vegetable.

27:35.073 --> 27:37.913
What good is a paranormal like that
going to do for the Tomorrow People?

27:52.355 --> 27:54.156
Everything okay?

27:54.158 --> 27:56.058
Yeah.

27:56.060 --> 27:57.793
Why do you ask?

27:57.795 --> 28:00.863
Uh, you just look even
more tense than usual.

28:00.865 --> 28:02.064
Hmm.

28:02.066 --> 28:03.746
No, I'm just thinking about John and Cara.

28:05.568 --> 28:08.603
How they wanted me to see the
brave and courageous rescue.

28:11.374 --> 28:14.676
- What do you see?
- Subterfuge.

28:14.678 --> 28:17.479
You see, Errol's kind of a loose cannon.

28:17.481 --> 28:20.582
Worthless to their cause. If
anything, he's a liability.

28:20.584 --> 28:22.416
Yeah, good point.

28:22.418 --> 28:26.588
Unless, of course, they're not
interested in Errol, but in the Citadel.

28:31.093 --> 28:33.094
How's your pain level?

28:33.096 --> 28:35.563
It's fine. I can handle it.

28:35.565 --> 28:37.164
Yeah, I hate to see you suffering.

28:37.166 --> 28:39.266

- No, really, that's not necessary.

going to order me to kill you.

34:23.768 --> 34:25.301
And I won't say no.

It's okay, Charlotte. This is
going to be your new home now.

34:40.067 --> 34:43.202
Here. Take a seat here. Thank you.

34:48.375 --> 34:49.875
- Let's go.
- What?

34:49.877 --> 34:51.409
You and I are paying your
boyfriend a little visit.

34:51.411 --> 34:54.212
No, no, no, no, please. Please,
you know what they'll do to me.

34:54.214 --> 34:57.349
- That's not my problem.
- Cara. What are you doing?

34:57.351 --> 34:59.451
Showing Jedikiah I'm willing
to go as far as he is.

34:59.453 --> 35:02.921
- Not like this.
- He shot Errol because he thinks I'm weak.

35:02.923 --> 35:06.291
So it's eye for an eye now?
You are better than Jedikiah.

35:06.293 --> 35:07.184
What does that matter?

35:07.185 --> 35:10.167
We have to start playing by
his rules if we want to survive.

35:10.230 --> 35:11.229
Look at her, Cara.

35:12.798 --> 35:17.101
If you can't see that she's one of
us, then you are lost as a leader.

35:17.103 --> 35:18.903
And we are lost as a people.

36:01.079 --> 36:03.213
Ah! He lives.

36:03.215 --> 36:05.716
Why didn't you wake me up?
My mom must be freaking out.

36:05.718 --> 36:07.818
I already took care of it.

36:07.820 --> 36:11.054
I called her, told her you fell asleep
at your desk doing a research project.

36:11.056 --> 36:13.724
'Course you might have to lose that sling.

36:13.726 --> 36:15.491
And she bought that?

36:15.493 --> 36:17.960
Stephen, you don't become the head
of a covert law enforcement agency

36:17.962 --> 36:20.430
without honing some powers of persuasion.

36:22.032 --> 36:22.998
And intuition.

36:25.469 --> 36:27.136
What's that supposed to mean?

36:27.138 --> 36:30.906
Just that Cara used Errol
as a pawn in a greater plan.

36:30.908 --> 36:33.042
Thank God we nipped that in the bud.

36:33.044 --> 36:34.309
Yeah. Good.

36:35.846 --> 36:38.180
You know, I'm glad you said that,

36:38.182 --> 36:39.946
because I was starting to get the idea

36:39.947 --> 36:41.276
that you might have been in on that plan.

36:41.452 --> 36:43.352
(SCOFFING) Yeah, obviously.

36:43.354 --> 36:48.457
Yeah, interesting... John
managed to hit only soft tissue.

36:48.459 --> 36:51.326
Now imagine the odds of that,

36:51.328 --> 36:53.828
especially when the shooter
was a former pupil of mine

36:53.830 --> 36:56.131
who could always be
counted upon for accuracy.

36:56.133 --> 36:59.834
Okay, I am sick and tired of
being under your magnifying glass.

36:59.836 --> 37:01.515
I work my ass off here

37:01.516 --> 37:04.139
and all I get back is
suspicion and smoke and mirrors.

37:04.674 --> 37:06.841
I have earned the right to be trusted.

37:08.978 --> 37:11.345
- Noted.
- Not good enough.

37:11.347 --> 37:14.849
You want me to be a good soldier?
I need something from you.

37:15.918 --> 37:17.886
And what do you think that might be?

37:17.888 --> 37:20.888
The truth. Who's Simon Plame?

37:36.905 --> 37:42.109
Simon Plame was another
student of Professor Crick's.

37:42.111 --> 37:48.415
I think he suffered from an
overzealous loyalty to your father.

37:48.417 --> 37:49.917
Overzealous how?

37:49.919 --> 37:54.487
On the day your father was killed,
which was a very tragic day,

37:54.489 --> 37:59.526
Simon broke into this very building
and tried to steal your father's corpse.

37:59.528 --> 38:00.993
Can't imagine why.

38:08.035 --> 38:11.003
I killed Simon Plame for trying
to take your father away from me.

38:13.673 --> 38:19.078
I cremated Roger's body myself.
Your father's dead. That's the truth.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.146
Accept it.

38:25.219 --> 38:26.819
Maybe it wasn't Plame.

38:28.087 --> 38:30.422
How? I saw the picture. It was him.

38:33.326 --> 38:36.762
Okay. So he's dead.

38:38.465 --> 38:40.098
That's a setback.

38:42.268 --> 38:47.239
Jedikiah cremated my father. No
body, no bringing him back from limbo.

38:48.841 --> 38:49.975
I don't buy it.

38:51.277 --> 38:54.746
Jedikiah's lies tell lies.

38:54.748 --> 38:57.148
Do you honestly think that
he'd incinerate his own brother?

39:01.453 --> 39:04.121
- I don't.
- I don't.

39:05.156 --> 39:06.724
I don't.

39:10.195 --> 39:11.429
I don't know.

39:16.734 --> 39:18.102
Hey.

39:19.737 --> 39:23.140
Look, you were right, okay?
My dad being out there.

39:24.742 --> 39:28.345
It's a pipe dream. But it's my pipe dream.

39:28.347 --> 39:32.316
It doesn't matter what I think.
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

39:34.819 --> 39:37.287
Besides, what the hell do I know?

39:37.289 --> 39:42.158
First day on the job, I shoot you,
I lead us straight into an ambush.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.762
You broke into the Citadel.
You saved Charlotte's life.

39:49.366 --> 39:50.900
I got Errol killed.

39:50.902 --> 39:53.769
No, Errol sacrificed himself
so that you could save her.

39:53.771 --> 39:56.772
That girl has a future
now, thanks to both of you.

39:57.908 --> 40:00.743
- Appreciate the spin.
- It's not spin.

40:00.745 --> 40:05.014
Look, I took an actual bullet
because I believe in you.

40:05.016 --> 40:07.249
I believe in both of us.

40:07.251 --> 40:09.919
Either I'm going to find the
Refuge, or you're going to build one.

40:09.921 --> 40:11.454
Right here.

40:11.456 --> 40:12.788
Or both.

40:12.790 --> 40:16.191
Yeah, okay, or both.

40:16.193 --> 40:21.063
Look, I know we're feeling like
long shots today, but together?

40:21.065 --> 40:22.497
I don't hate our odds.

40:32.375 --> 40:35.210
Hey, I'm home.

40:35.212 --> 40:39.481
Mmm. All-nighter at the office? Right.

40:39.483 --> 40:40.748
Hey, who's the girl?

40:42.184 --> 40:44.919
(SIGHING) Wouldn't you like to know?

40:46.355 --> 40:48.122
Since when do we have donuts in the house?

40:48.124 --> 40:52.894
Oh. Since ol' loverboy started
giving Mom the full-court press.

40:52.896 --> 40:53.895
Hmm.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.263
(CHUCKLING)

40:58.166 --> 40:59.467
Hey, there you are.

40:59.469 --> 41:01.068
Hi.

41:01.070 --> 41:03.371
- Rough night?
- Yeah. Sorry.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.339
Want some breakfast?

41:05.341 --> 41:07.074
Donuts. No thanks.

41:07.076 --> 41:08.876
You remember Peter.

41:09.978 --> 41:12.045
- Hey.
- Hey, pal.

41:12.047 --> 41:13.374
I just walked in, I promise.

41:13.375 --> 41:15.148
I know this looks like
the morning after, but...

41:15.150 --> 41:16.383
Never crossed my mind, Pete.

41:16.385 --> 41:18.619
(LAUGHING)

41:18.621 --> 41:22.856
So your mom was just telling me about
your internship at the Genetics Institute.

41:22.858 --> 41:24.391
Fascinating stuff.

41:24.393 --> 41:27.060
Yeah. I'm gonna...

41:27.062 --> 41:28.094
Okay.

41:33.901 --> 41:35.502
(MURMURING) We can go if you'd like.

41:35.504 --> 41:37.904
(PULSATING)

41:37.906 --> 41:40.240
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING)

41:40.242 --> 41:41.274
Hey, Stephen?

41:47.781 --> 41:48.781
You okay, pal?

41:50.183 --> 41:51.750
Yeah. Fine.
