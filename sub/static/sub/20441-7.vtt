WEBVTT

00:06.479 --> 00:08.270
Jian Yang whipped
Periscope and walked out

00:08.270 --> 00:10.020
with a four million dollar
acquisition offer.

00:10.228 --> 00:12.395
- Hey!
- Is the refrigerator running?

00:12.395 --> 00:15.103
It's a Mike Hunt.
And, uh, he's a rich.

00:15.562 --> 00:16.604
Shit!

00:17.771 --> 00:19.062
I'd like a job, dearest.

00:19.479 --> 00:21.437
Now, I will not phone it in.
I will be the first one here

00:21.437 --> 00:24.937
at 10:30 AM, and the last one
to leave a smidge after four.

00:26.687 --> 00:29.479
You ratted
your girlfriend out to the FBI

00:29.479 --> 00:32.354
because you're too big
of a pussy to break up with her?

00:32.354 --> 00:34.145
I'll never tell, but yes.
Yes, I did.

00:34.354 --> 00:36.937
She wouldn't happen
to know the model of our router,

00:36.937 --> 00:39.395
- would she?
- Ladies?

00:39.395 --> 00:41.604
- Holy shit, is that--
Keenan Feldspar?

00:41.604 --> 00:42.562
Yes. Imagine.

00:42.937 --> 00:45.103
Landing the biggest whale
two weeks

00:45.103 --> 00:47.937
before we launch your firm.

01:00.145 --> 01:01.896
That's a good one,
Richard.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.978
No, but seriously,
what brings you in today?

01:03.978 --> 01:07.312
No, I am-- I am serious.
I would like a...
an STD check.

01:07.312 --> 01:09.604
What, did you graze your penis
against a toilet seat?

01:09.604 --> 01:12.395
No. I... I had sex.

01:12.395 --> 01:14.479
Sex with what?
Female.

01:14.479 --> 01:16.062
A female what?

01:16.062 --> 01:17.646
A female human.

01:17.646 --> 01:21.812
And I-I don't know
this woman very well,
and we didn't use a condom.

01:21.812 --> 01:23.479
Now, listen, Richard,
I wouldn't worry so much.

01:23.479 --> 01:25.437
People don't really get
STDs anymore.

01:25.437 --> 01:27.812
We'll get
your tests back soon,
and I would tell you

01:27.812 --> 01:30.187
not to have sex
before then, but let's face it--

01:30.187 --> 01:31.687
lightning ain't gonna
strike twice, is it?

01:31.687 --> 01:33.312
It's possible.

01:33.312 --> 01:34.479
Huh?
It's possible.

01:35.978 --> 01:36.937
No.

01:36.937 --> 01:38.646
Hey, here's something strange.

01:38.646 --> 01:40.978
Would you mind hopping up
on that scale for a sec?

01:40.978 --> 01:43.103
Okay, why?
Am I gaining weight?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.687
I have been working
like crazy,
eating like crap.

01:45.687 --> 01:48.354
I haven't been exercising
at all, really, so--

01:48.354 --> 01:49.604
Yeah, look at that.

01:49.604 --> 01:51.145
You are an inch shorter

01:51.145 --> 01:53.270
than you were
this time last year.

01:53.270 --> 01:54.520
You're shrinking,
my friend.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.062
How is that possible?

01:56.062 --> 01:58.687
Well, you just told me.
It's your unhealthy
lifestyle, Richard.

01:58.687 --> 02:00.729
It's a loss
of mineral bone density.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.812
So, what do I do?
I'm gonna put you
on calcium supplements,

02:03.812 --> 02:05.771
and I'm gonna
have you come back
in about three weeks.

02:05.771 --> 02:08.687
I'll see you then...
or whatever's left of you.

02:22.354 --> 02:24.187
So, Erlich, good news:

02:24.187 --> 02:26.270
Keenan Feldspar signed
his term sheet,

02:26.270 --> 02:29.312
and we are now
officially negotiating
the finer points of his deal.

02:29.312 --> 02:33.020
Fantastic! Well,
now the real work begins.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.729
To that end,
we would like to clarify
our arrangement with you.

02:36.729 --> 02:39.812
We feel that
a generous finder's fee

02:39.812 --> 02:41.729
will be more
than satisfactory.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.562
This meeting is over.

02:44.562 --> 02:47.020
This is very generous, but I--
I was under the impression

02:47.020 --> 02:50.562
that, um, I was going
to be hired here,

02:50.562 --> 02:53.562
and I've actually told
quite a few people
that I was hired,

02:53.562 --> 02:57.354
so if I wasn't,
then it would look
like I was fired.

02:57.354 --> 02:58.854
That is fine.

02:59.854 --> 03:01.978
No. Laurie...

03:01.978 --> 03:05.729
I will not allow you
to make the same mistake

03:05.729 --> 03:08.354
that Uber,
Palantir, Zenefits,

03:08.354 --> 03:10.812
and, in my earlier years,
Chipotle

03:10.812 --> 03:12.479
made by not hiring me.

03:14.771 --> 03:16.312
All right,
don't hire me.

03:16.312 --> 03:20.228
But can you hack
this finder's fee
into 52 installments,

03:20.228 --> 03:22.354
paid weekly
over the course
of the next year?

03:22.354 --> 03:24.479
You mean...
a salary?

03:24.479 --> 03:25.937
Those are your words,
not mine.

03:25.937 --> 03:27.937
The finder's fee and...

03:29.562 --> 03:31.103
10,000 to go away?

03:31.103 --> 03:33.978
You know, looking around
at Bream-Hall,

03:33.978 --> 03:35.854
I see a lot of the same:

03:35.854 --> 03:39.854
the same gender--
Both partners happen
to be female, Erlich.

03:39.854 --> 03:41.896
Great catch.
What's your point?

03:41.896 --> 03:44.479
There is a grotesque
gender imbalance

03:44.479 --> 03:48.103
in the VC field right now.
I can help you navigate
the toxicity

03:48.103 --> 03:51.978
of this male culture
which is encroaching
on our feminist island.

03:51.978 --> 03:55.103
I mean, for instance,
there's something
called mansplaining?

03:55.103 --> 03:57.437
Have you heard about this?
We know
what mansplaining is.

03:57.437 --> 04:01.520
Mansplaining is when a man
will condescendingly explain

04:01.520 --> 04:04.312
something to a woman
that she already knows.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.687
Mr. Bachman,
we have work to do.

04:07.687 --> 04:10.062
All right. Laurie...

04:10.062 --> 04:12.312
half the finder's fee
for me to stay.

04:12.312 --> 04:15.896
I don't think
that you'll find
an associate, um...

04:15.896 --> 04:18.312
with my track record
at a better price.

04:18.312 --> 04:21.019
It's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.

04:23.145 --> 04:24.437
I need this.

04:26.062 --> 04:28.228
Fine. You may start Monday.

04:28.228 --> 04:30.812
Okay. Ooh, this Monday?

04:32.270 --> 04:34.354
That's fine.
Of course.

04:40.312 --> 04:41.604
What's that?

04:41.604 --> 04:44.687
SonicWall SonicPoint ACe...

04:45.854 --> 04:47.520
paired with the TZ600.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.812
Top-of-the-line
firewall protection,

04:49.812 --> 04:53.437
built-in intrusion prevention,
SSL decryption and inspection,

04:53.437 --> 04:56.520
application control,
and content filtering.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.937
Saying new router
would be so much quicker.

04:58.937 --> 05:02.354
Dinesh, the one good thing
that came out of you
slapping your body

05:02.354 --> 05:05.395
against that cyberterrorist
in a vulgar parody
of the act of love

05:05.395 --> 05:08.812
is that we finally
have a network with
real security value.

05:08.812 --> 05:12.520
Why would we need it?
Mia is in a federal facility

05:12.520 --> 05:14.270
with no access
to the Internet.

05:14.270 --> 05:18.437
Right, and she has never shown
a proclivity for getting
around infrastructure.

05:18.437 --> 05:21.145
Did you see this?
We've only been live
for two weeks,

05:21.145 --> 05:23.854
and we just
cracked the top 500
in the Hooli app store.

05:26.604 --> 05:29.562
Oh, look at that.
Ranked 499.

05:29.562 --> 05:33.145
Of utilities.
Yeah, subgroup mobile,
subgroup storage.

05:33.145 --> 05:37.729
True, but overall,
we're firmly in the top 30,000
Hooli phone apps.

05:37.729 --> 05:39.937
I mean, we may not be
a global epidemic yet,

05:39.937 --> 05:43.479
but... we've leapt
from bat saliva to humans

05:43.479 --> 05:45.896
and-- and we've just killed
our first few villagers.

05:48.479 --> 05:51.103
This warm.
This warm.

05:51.103 --> 05:52.687
This warm.

05:52.687 --> 05:54.729
This warm.
I get it, Jian-Yang!

05:54.729 --> 05:56.062
The refrigerator
is broken.

05:56.062 --> 05:58.270
The ice cream is melting.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.437
Let me guess.
Is it because it's warm?

06:00.437 --> 06:03.062
Yes.
Fine, I'll call
the repairman,

06:03.062 --> 06:05.103
and he'll come here
and fix it posthaste.

06:05.103 --> 06:08.228
No, I want
a new fridge,

06:08.228 --> 06:09.771
a smarter fridge...

06:10.978 --> 06:12.103
like this.

06:12.103 --> 06:15.395
Fourteen thousand dollars
for a smart fridge?

06:15.395 --> 06:17.604
Unlike you,
I now work for a living.

06:17.604 --> 06:20.020
I'm not gonna drop
that kind of dough
on a fridge.

06:20.020 --> 06:22.562
I ordered it already.
I buy it for myself.

06:22.562 --> 06:23.978
Then why are you talking
to me about it?

06:23.978 --> 06:25.520
To make you feel bad,

06:25.520 --> 06:28.437
because you are
fat and poor.

06:37.145 --> 06:40.479
- Go for Erlich.
- E. Bachman! E. Chen.

06:40.479 --> 06:41.562
Got your message.

06:41.562 --> 06:42.978
Bream-Hall, huh?

06:42.978 --> 06:44.228
Yes, starting today.

06:44.228 --> 06:47.646
I hope that this doesn't create
any tension between us,

06:47.646 --> 06:49.812
us now being
competitors and all.

06:49.812 --> 06:51.062
Hey. None-zo.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.479
Hey, while I have you,
some of the boys are part

06:53.479 --> 06:55.145
of the ownership group
of the Warriors.

06:55.145 --> 06:59.062
We have an extra spot
on the floor at Oracle Arena.
You a hoops guy?

06:59.062 --> 07:03.145
Oops, sorry, you broke up.
Could you, uh, could you
say that again?

07:03.145 --> 07:05.479
We have an extra spot
on the floor tonight

07:05.479 --> 07:07.354
at Oracle Arena.
You a hoops guy?

07:07.354 --> 07:11.812
What red-blooded American male
in the VC boys' club isn't?

07:11.812 --> 07:14.103
Okay. Cool.
I'll text you the deets.

07:14.103 --> 07:15.729
Later, man.

07:15.729 --> 07:19.228
Well, boys,
I've been in the VC game
for just one day,

07:19.228 --> 07:22.145
and already I have floor seats
to watch the Warriors.

07:22.145 --> 07:26.187
But you hate basketball.
I'll concede that spending
all my time

07:26.187 --> 07:28.687
inside of a house
with you scrawny code jockeys,

07:28.687 --> 07:30.354
the Incredible
Shrinking Hendricks,

07:30.354 --> 07:32.687
and whatever the fuck
Jared is here...

07:32.687 --> 07:35.228
...may have blunted
my conventional masculinity

07:35.228 --> 07:37.562
a hair, but it's
always been there.

07:37.562 --> 07:40.228
Uh-huh. Well,
try and get a selfie
with Steph Curry.

07:40.228 --> 07:43.395
I will,
assuming she's there.

07:43.395 --> 07:45.520
Hey, Jared, um,
look at this e-mail here.

07:45.520 --> 07:50.228
Uh, "Dear Richard,
I recently became aware
of your Space Saver app.

07:50.228 --> 07:53.187
"I think your app may infringe
upon my own patented technology.

07:53.187 --> 07:57.687
"If your schedule permits,
I would love to discuss this
with you as soon as possible.

07:57.687 --> 08:00.062
Sincerely,
Stewart Burke."

08:00.062 --> 08:02.395
I thought we handled
that patent stuff.
We own it, right?

08:02.395 --> 08:07.395
Yeah. I'll--
I'll send him a harshly worded
cease-and-desist letter.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.062
Actually, uh...

08:09.062 --> 08:11.896
his work address is
some house in Mountain View.

08:11.896 --> 08:14.646
He's probably just working
out of his garage,
just like us.

08:14.646 --> 08:16.978
Why don't I go over there,
walk him through the app,

08:16.978 --> 08:19.896
you know, coder to coder.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

08:19.896 --> 08:21.479
You've got a big heart.

08:21.479 --> 08:25.395
Or maybe it just seems big
'cause the rest of him
is shrinking.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.312
Hi. Richard Hendricks.
We exchanged e-mails?

08:35.312 --> 08:38.187
No.
Are-- are you
Stewart Burke?

08:38.187 --> 08:41.687
No.
I'm sorry.
Does Stewart Burke live here?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.604
Yeah.

08:43.604 --> 08:46.270
Okay. Is he in?
Can I speak with him?

08:46.270 --> 08:48.145
Grandpa!
Some guy's here!

08:48.145 --> 08:50.604
My grandson is
the software expert.

08:50.604 --> 08:53.437
I couldn't tell a computer
from a toaster.

08:53.437 --> 08:55.937
Oh. So,
you're not a coder?

08:55.937 --> 09:00.479
Oh no, not at all.
I am an attorney.

09:00.479 --> 09:02.437
I started out
in the medical field,

09:02.437 --> 09:05.270
then in the auto industry,
and then the music business.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.270
Did you represent
all these people?

09:07.270 --> 09:09.270
No, I sued them.

09:09.270 --> 09:11.729
Look, that's me
with Stevie Wonder.

09:11.729 --> 09:13.604
He never saw it coming.

09:13.604 --> 09:16.854
You get it?
Uh, yes,
because he's blind.

09:16.854 --> 09:18.228
Right.

09:18.228 --> 09:22.103
I'm sorry.
I don't know what this...
has to do with--

09:22.103 --> 09:26.854
You see this?
This is a song I bought
at a copyright auction.

09:26.854 --> 09:28.646
It's an old mariachi number

09:28.646 --> 09:30.687
that had cost me
practically nothing

09:30.687 --> 09:33.312
and so far has bought me
two houses

09:33.312 --> 09:37.646
and put my
village idiot grandson
through six years of Emerson.

09:37.646 --> 09:41.896
Oh. All that
from "Cancion de Amores"?

09:41.896 --> 09:46.312
Was it a popular song?
No. I used the copyright
on this song

09:46.312 --> 09:48.646
to sue writers
of all kinds of songs.

09:48.646 --> 09:52.020
Anyway, the writers
usually settle, pay me off,

09:52.020 --> 09:54.646
or give me a chunk
of their song.

09:54.646 --> 09:57.103
Thanks to
"Cancion de Amores" here,

09:57.103 --> 10:01.646
I now own 10 percent
of Katrina and the Waves'
"Walking on Sunshine."

10:01.646 --> 10:03.145
Mmm.
It's a classic!

10:03.145 --> 10:04.687
And when it runs next month

10:04.687 --> 10:08.562
on Mazda's
new Super Bowl spot,
I print money.

10:08.562 --> 10:12.520
But sadly,
all the good music
copyrights are gone.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.437
That is... so sad.
And that's why
I moved into tech.

10:16.437 --> 10:20.145
And now,
I sue people like you.

10:22.354 --> 10:23.604
What?

10:23.604 --> 10:25.520
So, he's a patent troll?

10:25.520 --> 10:29.646
Yep, as like in buy a ton
of super-broad IP

10:29.646 --> 10:31.354
from failed startups
at auction,

10:31.354 --> 10:35.020
and then threaten litigation
against accused infringers,

10:35.020 --> 10:36.729
i.e., you.

10:36.729 --> 10:40.020
So, uh, how much
is Burke asking for?

10:40.020 --> 10:41.771
Twenty thousand dollars.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.479
Ah, you're getting off easy.

10:43.479 --> 10:46.145
Well, no.
Look, his patent covers...

10:46.145 --> 10:48.729
"storage of media files
on a network."

10:48.729 --> 10:50.479
I mean, that cannot
be enforceable.

10:50.479 --> 10:52.020
It's probably not...

10:52.020 --> 10:54.729
but to find out,
you're gonna have
to fight him in court.

10:54.729 --> 10:57.437
For a good litigator,
we're talking at least...

10:57.437 --> 10:59.395
a couple hundred grand.

10:59.395 --> 11:01.145
Just pay him
the 20 grand, Richard.

11:01.145 --> 11:03.937
I could get creative
and take some money out
of the Melcher deal.

11:03.937 --> 11:06.228
- There you go.
- No, we need that money.

11:06.228 --> 11:07.771
This is a shakedown.
He's a crook.

11:07.771 --> 11:09.604
And right when our app
was getting off the ground.

11:09.604 --> 11:11.395
That's how he found you.

11:11.395 --> 11:13.228
Guys just landed
on the app store

11:13.228 --> 11:14.854
top 500 list, right?
Yeah.

11:14.854 --> 11:17.896
So, Burke starts
at the bottom of those lists

11:17.896 --> 11:19.145
and works his way up.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.729
The more settlements he gets,
the stronger his case.

11:21.729 --> 11:24.437
The higher you are on the list,
the more money he asks for.

11:24.437 --> 11:26.729
It's like--
it's like limp biscuit.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.354
He sued those guys too?
Not the band.

11:29.354 --> 11:31.520
The thing the band
is named after.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.479
Limp biscuit's
an old frat ritual,

11:33.479 --> 11:36.854
where all the brothers race
to stroke one out
onto a biscuit,

11:36.854 --> 11:39.729
and then the last guy
to nut has to eat it.

11:39.729 --> 11:41.604
Right.
Sometimes it's
a Wheat Thin.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.729
Look, Richie, I get it.

11:46.729 --> 11:49.020
It's embarrassing
to pull your pud

11:49.020 --> 11:51.604
in front of
the whole pledge class.

11:51.604 --> 11:53.062
Just pay the guy.

11:54.729 --> 11:56.062
Or...

11:56.062 --> 11:59.687
maybe... we convince
the entire pledge class

11:59.687 --> 12:02.937
to not play the game
at all in the first place.

12:02.937 --> 12:04.270
If only.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.646
This must be
the new fridge.

12:11.646 --> 12:13.729
You like this?
Look, it has a screen

12:13.729 --> 12:15.771
so you can see
all the food that's inside.

12:15.771 --> 12:18.395
Mm-hmm.
Kind of like that one?

12:18.395 --> 12:19.896
This one has an app,

12:19.896 --> 12:22.312
so you can actually watch
the food on your phone.

12:22.312 --> 12:23.646
All it needs to do

12:23.646 --> 12:25.646
is keep
my fucking beer cold.

12:25.646 --> 12:28.020
Hmm. You're running low
on beer.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.312
Fuck you.

12:29.312 --> 12:32.520
Whoops! Did you forget
to scan that bar code?

12:32.520 --> 12:35.312
Yes, I did... on purpose.

12:36.646 --> 12:38.145
Ah! There we go.

12:38.145 --> 12:39.562
It's bad enough
it has to talk.

12:39.562 --> 12:42.646
Does it need fake
vocal ticks like, "ah"?

12:42.646 --> 12:44.520
Well, it just makes
it sound more human.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.103
Humans are shit.
This thing is addressing
problems that don't exist.

12:48.103 --> 12:49.562
It's solutionism
at its worst.

12:49.562 --> 12:53.729
We are dumbing down machines
that are inherently superior.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.854
Whatever.
You gave your server
a human name.

12:55.854 --> 12:57.687
You named it Anton.

12:57.687 --> 12:59.978
Yeah, but Anton doesn't
call me anything.

12:59.978 --> 13:02.479
He grimly does his work,
then he sits motionless

13:02.479 --> 13:05.646
till it's time to work again.
We could all take a page
from his book.

13:05.646 --> 13:09.020
Uh-oh! That yogurt
is expired.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.187
See? This could've killed me.

13:12.187 --> 13:14.479
Now I can give it to Erlich.

13:23.020 --> 13:25.562
Hmm. I'm not quite sure
what you're doing.

13:25.562 --> 13:27.103
Is there something
I can help you with?

13:27.103 --> 13:29.145
Yeah, how do
I shut you the fuck up?

13:29.145 --> 13:31.020
Aw, is somebody
having a rough day?

13:31.020 --> 13:33.896
Did that fucker
password-protect
the settings?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.395
His fridge, his rules.

13:35.395 --> 13:37.020
Fuck.

13:41.062 --> 13:44.479
My man, I was told I had
a spot on the floor tonight,

13:44.479 --> 13:45.812
but it seems
that I've committed

13:45.812 --> 13:47.978
the cardinal sin
of being early.

13:47.978 --> 13:50.145
What time does
the game actually start?

13:50.145 --> 13:51.937
It's about to.

13:55.562 --> 13:57.978
Wait. When he said,
"a spot on the floor,"

13:57.978 --> 14:00.520
did he mean...
on the floor?

14:00.520 --> 14:02.729
I wasn't a part
of the conversation.

14:02.729 --> 14:05.520
Come on, baby, come on!
Come on, bring it! Unh!

14:05.520 --> 14:07.854
I cannot do that.

14:07.854 --> 14:09.729
All right,
you guys go shirts.

14:09.729 --> 14:10.854
We'll go skins.

14:12.771 --> 14:14.978
And I can definitely
not do that.

14:16.604 --> 14:18.062
Will not.

14:18.062 --> 14:20.604
Don't let him drive on you.

14:20.604 --> 14:22.604
All day.

14:26.062 --> 14:27.604
Yo, Erlich.
Where you at, dawg?

14:27.604 --> 14:29.270
Yo, what up, what up, what up?

14:29.270 --> 14:32.937
Which one of you pussies,
uh, put sugar in my gas tank

14:32.937 --> 14:35.270
to prevent me
from housing you
on the hardwood?

14:35.270 --> 14:37.812
What?
Yeah, my car won't start.

14:37.812 --> 14:39.395
It's a real fucked situation,

14:39.395 --> 14:42.937
so I guess I'll have to miss
this once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to--

14:42.937 --> 14:44.479
We play every Tuesday.

14:44.479 --> 14:47.937
I'll see you next week,
bro-seph.

14:53.103 --> 14:55.937
Hey, let me get in.
Let me get in. Let me get in.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.896
Hey, I squished
those front-end bugs.

14:58.896 --> 15:02.312
Did you finish
your networking issue?
Nope.

15:02.312 --> 15:05.187
Hmm. I'm sorry.
Wrong password.

15:05.187 --> 15:07.978
You're sitting here, trying
to hack Jian-Yang's password

15:07.978 --> 15:09.395
instead of doing
your actual work?

15:09.395 --> 15:12.354
Well, good luck,
it's a 10-digit alphanumeric.

15:12.354 --> 15:14.187
Ten digit? Fuck.

15:14.187 --> 15:16.020
And you have
one underpowered laptop,

15:16.020 --> 15:17.978
so you know,
you should have
the answer in...

15:21.354 --> 15:22.687
9,000 years.

15:22.687 --> 15:25.604
Time to pull out the big gun.

15:25.604 --> 15:27.978
Well, maybe you should
pull out the bug gun...

15:28.937 --> 15:30.395
'cause of the network bug.

15:30.395 --> 15:32.729
As in the bug
you're supposed
to be fixing.

15:32.729 --> 15:36.395
If you were programmed
to have a good sense of humor,
you'd laugh at that.

15:36.395 --> 15:40.228
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see
any Good Humor ice cream bars.

15:40.228 --> 15:43.562
Shall I add them
to your shopping list?
You know what? Yeah.

15:43.562 --> 15:45.771
Good Humor ice cream bars

15:45.771 --> 15:47.312
added to your
shopping list.
Come on.

15:47.312 --> 15:49.937
God. You believe this?
I'm-- I'm still on hold.

15:49.937 --> 15:52.103
With?
Microsoft Azure.

15:52.103 --> 15:55.520
Yeah, I-- I'm trying
to negotiate a lower
cloud storage rate

15:55.520 --> 15:58.562
because we're gonna need it if,
or more realistically when,

15:58.562 --> 16:00.937
Richard finally decides
to pay that patent troll.

16:00.937 --> 16:03.854
I mean,
I'm still on hold.

16:03.854 --> 16:06.354
It's like they don't even care
about small businesses.

16:06.354 --> 16:08.854
Jared, they don't care
about small businesses.

16:08.854 --> 16:10.771
That's why small businesses
have to lie.

16:10.771 --> 16:14.020
Like, um,
Google named their
first building Building 40,

16:14.020 --> 16:16.312
so that people would think
they were already huge.

16:16.312 --> 16:17.854
When I worked
at my first startup,

16:17.854 --> 16:20.312
I would transfer people
to "my supervisor,"

16:20.312 --> 16:23.187
and then I'd just get back
on the phone myself.

16:23.187 --> 16:24.729
Oh. Uh, yeah, hello.

16:25.937 --> 16:28.145
No, no, I'm not gonna
go on hold again.

16:28.145 --> 16:31.854
Um, in fact,
could I transfer you
to my supervisor?

16:31.854 --> 16:34.187
Oh.

16:34.187 --> 16:36.062
Oh, no, no, no,
I have to take a shit.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.729
Just, um... do your best
Ed Chen impression.

16:42.687 --> 16:44.020
Um, one moment please.

16:49.228 --> 16:52.270
What's up?
You got Ed Ch-- Chambers.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.145
Hello, everybody.
Thanks again for making it.

16:57.145 --> 16:59.520
And thanks to Gus
of Gigglybots for hosting.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.562
No problem.
My name is, uh,
Richard Hendricks,

17:02.562 --> 17:03.896
uh, of Pied Piper.

17:03.896 --> 17:05.686
You're the guys working
for Gavin Belson.

17:05.686 --> 17:09.520
Was working
with Gavin Belson, yeah.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.186
So, he's not coming?
No. No, not at all.

17:12.186 --> 17:16.936
But I'll have you all know
that without any involvement
from Gavin Belson,

17:16.936 --> 17:18.729
Pied Piper,
just like yourselves,

17:18.729 --> 17:21.936
has reached the Hooli
app store's top 500 list,

17:21.936 --> 17:23.936
and you guys are aware

17:23.936 --> 17:26.811
that you are all directly
above us on the list,

17:26.811 --> 17:30.854
which is why you should know
that a patent troll

17:30.854 --> 17:33.354
named Stewart Burke
has recently demanded

17:33.354 --> 17:36.062
that I pay
a $20,000 licensing fee,

17:36.062 --> 17:41.395
and if I pay,
he's gonna come and ask
you guys for more money.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.937
He starts
with the little guy.

17:44.103 --> 17:46.395
Not that I'm little.
I'm, uh...

17:46.395 --> 17:48.729
I mean I'm not.

17:48.729 --> 17:50.103
I'm actually, uh...

17:51.978 --> 17:54.270
above average height.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.395
Isn't this something
that could have been done
over e-mail?

17:56.395 --> 17:58.479
I mean, I guess,
but-- look.

17:58.479 --> 18:02.854
If we don't stop this guy,
he's gonna just keep asking
for more and more money

18:02.854 --> 18:05.437
until someone is stuck
with an unpayable bill.

18:05.437 --> 18:07.729
It's kind of like
that old fraternity game,

18:07.729 --> 18:09.145
uh, the limp biscuit.

18:11.687 --> 18:14.646
Sorry, I wasn't
in a fraternity.
What is that?

18:14.646 --> 18:16.520
Oh, I-I-- I don't think
we need to get into--

18:16.520 --> 18:20.646
It's where guys stand
in a circle and masturbate
onto a cracker.

18:20.646 --> 18:24.812
And then
the last guy... eats it.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.896
What?

18:26.978 --> 18:29.020
Again, I-- again--
I don't really know

18:29.020 --> 18:31.354
why he would mention that.
It's super gross.

18:31.354 --> 18:34.729
Is this why Gavin Belson
stopped working with you?
No.

18:35.687 --> 18:38.145
The important thing is here,

18:38.145 --> 18:42.062
um, my lawyer
has actually drafted
a partnership agreement.

18:42.062 --> 18:44.562
Why don't you all just--
Essentially, uh,

18:44.562 --> 18:48.646
we all band together
and each contribute $20,000.

18:48.646 --> 18:50.562
We should have
more than enough money

18:50.562 --> 18:53.270
to mount a challenge
against this guy's patent.

18:53.270 --> 18:55.354
And if we win,
we dissolve the patent,

18:55.354 --> 18:57.854
so that he can't do this
to anyone else ever again.

18:57.854 --> 18:59.604
Because in the end,

18:59.604 --> 19:02.687
shouldn't it be
Mr. Stewart Burke,
the patent troll,

19:02.687 --> 19:05.437
who is forced
to eat the biscuit?

19:05.437 --> 19:07.103
I'm pretty sure
that's sexual assault.

19:07.103 --> 19:09.020
Yeah, no one deserves that.

19:09.020 --> 19:11.687
I know. That--
that's all I'm saying.

19:11.687 --> 19:13.687
Look, I'm pretty sure
it's even made up.

19:13.687 --> 19:15.896
Like, you know,
like a donkey punch,
you know?

19:15.896 --> 19:19.479
Again, what is
a donkey punch?

19:19.479 --> 19:22.896
It's, uh, when guys--
Just don't. Don't.

19:28.395 --> 19:31.395
G-man, you busy
at the moment?

19:31.395 --> 19:33.978
Very. I'm about
to set Anton loose

19:33.978 --> 19:37.062
on that talking
chrome beer coozy.

19:37.062 --> 19:40.020
So, care to take
a breather and...

19:40.020 --> 19:43.729
help a pal throw
a basketball hoop
on the old garage?

19:43.729 --> 19:48.729
Why would you need help
from a scrawny code jockey
such as myself?

19:48.729 --> 19:49.937
Fine.

19:49.937 --> 19:52.896
I'm perfectly capable
of figuring it out myself.

19:52.896 --> 19:54.437
All I need is-- Ah!

19:56.604 --> 20:00.270
May I borrow
this hammer to pound in
these flamboyant little nails?

20:01.437 --> 20:03.896
Those are screws.
Yeah, no, I...

20:07.854 --> 20:11.896
Jared Dunn.
Yep, just a moment, please.
I'll transfer you.

20:13.228 --> 20:14.312
Go for Chambers.

20:15.978 --> 20:19.479
Ned! I knew it was you.

20:19.479 --> 20:22.687
Hey, did that pussy Jared
keep you on hold long?

20:22.687 --> 20:25.395
I eat that motherfucker's
lunch every day.

20:25.395 --> 20:29.729
No, man,
I literally eat his food.
What do you want?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.520
Uh-uh, ain't gonna happen.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.687
That's as high as we go, homo.
Till next time, rook.

20:34.687 --> 20:38.729
I mean,
did you see that?

20:38.729 --> 20:41.020
He's amazing.
Who?

20:41.020 --> 20:45.646
Ed Chambers. He got Pied Piper
a great cloud storage rate
from Azure,

20:45.646 --> 20:48.145
and he's got the hookup
on a couple of pallets

20:48.145 --> 20:52.646
of pamplemousse LaCroix at,
his words, an amaze-balls price.

20:52.646 --> 20:54.312
Wow. Good job, Jared.

20:54.312 --> 20:57.437
Well, I mean,
don't congratulate me.
Congratulate Ed Chambers.

20:57.437 --> 21:00.354
Ed Chambers is you.
Well, I wish, but--

21:00.354 --> 21:03.270
Gentlemen. You all said
that it couldn't be done,

21:03.270 --> 21:06.812
but it appears
as if Sir Richard
the Not-Short

21:06.812 --> 21:09.646
hath now slain
the slimy troll.

21:09.646 --> 21:12.062
Stu Burke.
R. Hendricks.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.437
I got word that you called.
I assume you spoke
with my attorney,

21:15.437 --> 21:17.228
Monsieur Ron Laflamme?

21:17.228 --> 21:19.854
Yes, I did speak
to Ron Laflamme.

21:19.854 --> 21:22.395
What, pray tell,
did he tell you
when he called you?

21:22.395 --> 21:24.062
Well, I called him, actually,

21:24.062 --> 21:26.145
to tell him
that the eight companies

21:26.145 --> 21:28.520
you apparently tried
to organize against me

21:28.520 --> 21:31.854
have reached out to me
preemptively to settle.

21:31.854 --> 21:33.854
And because
I appreciated that,

21:33.854 --> 21:37.228
I offered them a very,
very reasonable rate.

21:37.228 --> 21:40.312
So, Richard Hendricks,
fuck you.

21:40.312 --> 21:42.354
Okay. Uh, yeah.

21:43.354 --> 21:44.520
Uh-huh.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.978
I understand.

21:47.604 --> 21:48.687
So, you're firm on that?

21:50.020 --> 21:51.646
Well, bye then.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.479
So, your coalition
fucked us?
Yes.

21:56.479 --> 21:58.854
So, now we have
to pay the $20,000?

21:58.854 --> 22:01.270
Uh, not exactly.
Because he...

22:02.520 --> 22:05.520
Stu is saying
that since all eight companies

22:05.520 --> 22:07.395
have now licensed the patent,

22:07.395 --> 22:09.145
he has a stronger case
against us,

22:09.145 --> 22:12.270
so, um,
he'd actually like
m-more money.

22:12.270 --> 22:16.228
How much?
Three hundred
thousand dollars.

22:16.228 --> 22:19.270
So, we just ate
the Wheat Thin,
didn't we?

22:19.270 --> 22:22.228
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see
any Wheat Thins.

22:22.228 --> 22:24.228
Shall I add them
to your shopping list?

22:24.228 --> 22:26.312
Eh, sure.

22:26.312 --> 22:30.020
Well, let's hope that Melcher
doesn't hear about all this.

22:33.354 --> 22:36.520
You guys don't need
all these lights on, do you?

22:36.520 --> 22:37.771
Yes, we do.

22:37.771 --> 22:40.228
Okay. Well,
that should be fine.
We should be fine.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.646
Um, fine from what?

22:42.646 --> 22:44.020
That fridge is
putting up a fight,

22:44.020 --> 22:45.604
so I'm gonna have
to try something
with Anton.

22:45.604 --> 22:48.937
Might put a little strain
on the wiring, that's all.

22:48.937 --> 22:50.604
I'll be in the garage.

22:50.604 --> 22:54.812
Hey, Richard, but you're
not seriously gonna defend
yourself in court, right?

22:54.812 --> 22:57.437
Well, Larry Flynt did it.

22:57.437 --> 22:58.937
And Sir Walter Raleigh,

22:58.937 --> 23:01.729
although he lost
and was publicly beheaded.

23:01.729 --> 23:05.437
But you could argue
that he eventually won
in the court of history.

23:05.437 --> 23:08.187
I get it.
I should've settled.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.771
Okay? And I didn't.

23:09.771 --> 23:12.687
And you're right,
I will probably lose,

23:12.687 --> 23:14.812
but I'm not going down
without a fight.

23:14.812 --> 23:18.646
And I've got all
of Monahan's discovery
from the Hooli case right here,

23:18.646 --> 23:20.145
so that's something.

23:24.479 --> 23:26.729
Oh my God.

23:26.729 --> 23:28.270
This is from high school.

23:30.145 --> 23:35.103
These are all my notes
from the original build
of Pied Piper 1.0,

23:35.103 --> 23:41.312
back when it was
just some stupid search app
for music copyright...s.

23:44.771 --> 23:47.145
Hold on. Hold on.

23:47.145 --> 23:50.520
What the fuck?

23:50.520 --> 23:52.646
Sorry. Everybody okay?

23:52.646 --> 23:54.646
I don't know,
you fucking maniac!

23:54.646 --> 23:56.646
Are we?
Probably.

23:56.646 --> 24:00.062
Richard? What--
what are you up to?

24:00.062 --> 24:02.520
About six foot two, Jared.

24:06.479 --> 24:10.312
Looks like I can slay
that troll after all.

24:10.312 --> 24:12.103
What am I looking at?

24:12.103 --> 24:16.562
Well, you said that you used
"Cancion de Amores"

24:16.562 --> 24:18.187
to sue musicians,

24:18.187 --> 24:20.395
claimed that they stole
that song, right?

24:20.395 --> 24:24.228
Bought two houses,
put Jeremy through
four years of college.

24:24.228 --> 24:26.479
Six, and he's still
20 credits short.

24:26.479 --> 24:29.312
Okay, well, he may want
to consider financial aid,

24:29.312 --> 24:32.062
um, because
that little song there

24:32.062 --> 24:35.312
was itself stolen
from an old country song

24:35.312 --> 24:38.354
called "I'm Cryin'"

24:38.354 --> 24:41.479
from 1967,
a full eight years

24:41.479 --> 24:43.520
before "Cancion de Amores."

24:43.520 --> 24:46.437
And I'm pretty sure
Katrina and the Waves
would want to know

24:46.437 --> 24:50.896
that they gave you a piece
of "Walking on Sunshine"
for nothing.

24:50.896 --> 24:54.228
Mazda may want to pull
that whole Super Bowl spot.

24:54.228 --> 24:57.687
Bullshit.
No, no, not bullshit.
Computer science.

24:57.687 --> 25:00.729
Yeah, and we can take it
to court if you like,
see who they believe:

25:00.729 --> 25:05.270
perhaps the most
advanced and sophisticated
pattern-matching algorithm

25:05.270 --> 25:07.562
ever devised
by a fucking genius

25:07.562 --> 25:12.395
or some old asshole
who once sued Stevie Wonder.

25:12.395 --> 25:16.228
All right.
What do you want,
you little prick?

25:16.228 --> 25:18.187
Correction, sir.

25:18.187 --> 25:20.270
I am a big prick.

25:26.395 --> 25:28.270
Hello, my cold friend.

25:30.270 --> 25:31.187
Hello?

25:31.187 --> 25:33.437
Huh! Suck it, Jian-Yang.

25:33.437 --> 25:35.270
Mmm. Ah. Huh. Huh.

25:35.270 --> 25:37.520
You attack and destroy
my refrigerator?

25:37.520 --> 25:39.312
And you misspell my name.

25:39.312 --> 25:41.395
I did. I had
to overclock Anton,

25:41.395 --> 25:43.812
but I was able to brute-force
the backdoor password

25:43.812 --> 25:47.020
to that chrome piece of shit
in under 12 hours.

25:47.020 --> 25:49.020
And I added
a little visual flair.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.103
Huh.
Suck it, Jian-Yang.

25:51.103 --> 25:52.978
âª âªMmm. Ah. Huh.

25:56.771 --> 26:01.395
So?
So... he bought it.
Hook, line and sinker.

26:01.395 --> 26:03.437
Yeah, he thinks
the search results are real.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.395
You trolled the troll.

26:05.395 --> 26:07.479
Yeah, yeah,
for a second there,
he wasn't buying it,

26:07.479 --> 26:10.604
and then I just
started babbling on
about tech specs

26:10.604 --> 26:12.437
until his eyes glazed over.

26:12.437 --> 26:14.520
Well, as a result,
we now have

26:14.520 --> 26:17.854
a perpetual
royalty-free license
for the patent.

26:17.854 --> 26:22.228
Yes!
See? I stuck to my guns
and as a result,

26:22.228 --> 26:24.854
we now have 20 grand
we would have otherwise lost

26:24.854 --> 26:28.646
if I had listened to you
delicate little snowflakes
and settled.

26:28.646 --> 26:30.812
Yeah? Twenty grand.

26:30.812 --> 26:34.437
Yeah, so let me
cum into a bucket
and have you all drink it.

26:37.103 --> 26:40.937
Uh, Richard?
Could I have a--
a moment?

26:40.937 --> 26:42.771
Sorry about that.

26:42.771 --> 26:45.520
I-I-I-- I regretted it
the second it came out
of my mouth.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.520
Richard.
Well, yes, but...

26:50.437 --> 26:52.312
Here.
What's this?

26:52.312 --> 26:55.729
Um, that is a bill
from Ron Laflamme

26:55.729 --> 26:59.771
for the paperwork he had
to do to put your coalition
of companies together.

26:59.771 --> 27:01.562
Twenty-two
thousand dollars?

27:01.562 --> 27:04.312
Yeah. It's at the high end
of standard.

27:04.312 --> 27:07.520
So, it would've
cost us slightly less
if we'd have just...

27:07.520 --> 27:10.062
Paid the troll?
Well, that's true,

27:10.062 --> 27:12.604
but can you put
a price on dignity?

27:12.604 --> 27:14.562
Apparently,
I just did.

27:14.562 --> 27:17.771
Do me a favor
and don't tell the guys.

27:17.771 --> 27:20.062
Yeah. You have
my utmost discretion.
Thank you.

27:20.062 --> 27:23.729
Um, speaking of, Richard,
I need to tell you something.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.479
I had to let
Ed Chambers go.

27:25.479 --> 27:28.354
Who?
My fictional supervisor.

27:28.354 --> 27:32.729
He bragged to a sales rep
at LaCroix about doing it
to Sonia Sotomayor,

27:32.729 --> 27:34.978
so Ed is
no longer with us.

27:34.978 --> 27:36.937
I'm sure we can manage.

27:36.937 --> 27:38.729
He also was
never actually with us.

27:38.729 --> 27:41.562
Right. Out of sight,
out of mind.
'Cause he was never real.

27:41.562 --> 27:44.354
And out of reality.
Yeah, well.

27:45.896 --> 27:47.479
Oh, Ed Chambers.

27:47.479 --> 27:49.103
Don't hit--
No, no, no, no! Oh!

27:49.103 --> 27:51.562
Fuck!

27:53.103 --> 27:55.520
Yeah, a lot of these guys
aren't man enough

27:55.520 --> 27:59.020
to work for an all-female
led VC firm, but not me.

27:59.020 --> 28:01.646
I believe
that the future is female.

28:01.646 --> 28:04.771
And anyone who says otherwise
can suck my fat dick.

28:04.771 --> 28:05.896
Yo, yo, yo!

28:05.896 --> 28:07.729
Woo!

28:07.729 --> 28:09.937
Bachman, scoreboard.

28:09.937 --> 28:12.395
Ah, scoreboard. Fuck. Shit.

28:12.395 --> 28:13.479
Who made that one through the--

28:13.479 --> 28:15.395
It was a three-pointer, dumbass!

28:15.395 --> 28:17.771
Three-pointer?
What, are we in Europe?

28:17.771 --> 28:19.729
Pass!

28:19.729 --> 28:22.020
- Is he fucking with me?
- Shoot it!

29:33.562 --> 29:34.646
Hey Richard, how we doin'?

29:35.062 --> 29:36.270
Is there something going on
with your data?

29:36.604 --> 29:37.812
Are-- Are you watching
the weather channel?

29:38.187 --> 29:39.729
No. Why, is there a hurricane
or something?

29:39.729 --> 29:41.187
Worse. It's cold outside.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.729
Sometimes there's actual
frost on the road.

29:43.729 --> 29:45.520
People start filing
claims like crazy.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.729
Our whole office is
going nuts right now.

29:52.103 --> 29:53.520
This demo is insane.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.270
Richard, you wanna try the demo?

29:55.270 --> 29:56.771
No, I'm-- not a PR guy.

29:56.771 --> 29:58.520
He has a sensitive constitution.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.103
Aw, come on. You gotta do it.
It's gonna be awesome!

30:01.103 --> 30:02.270
-Come on, come on!
-Sure, I guess.

30:02.270 --> 30:03.145
After you.

30:04.187 --> 30:06.687
Wow, you really vomited a lot.

30:06.687 --> 30:07.854
And, like, immediately.
