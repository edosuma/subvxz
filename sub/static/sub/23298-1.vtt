01:05.498 --> 01:09.435
We could not have been
more wrong all of this.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.609
I'm not quite sure
what time I'll be home,

01:17.611 --> 01:20.145
maybe around...
7:00 or 8:00 tonight.

01:20.147 --> 01:21.780
Um...

01:21.782 --> 01:25.551
I was telling you about this...
Filming thing we got going on.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.253
You know, I was telling you they do
these internal communication things

01:28.255 --> 01:30.322
at the space agency.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.092
Anyway, they asked me if, um,

01:33.094 --> 01:35.527
they could, sort of,
have a day in the life.

01:35.529 --> 01:39.431
They want to do day in the life of some
of the senior members of the agencies.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.433
Um, I'm not...
So how does this work?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.635
Should... are you guys
rolling now or...?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.370
Yeah, that's why they're here.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.840
Hello, everybody,
welcome to our home.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.476
Um... this is
my lovely daughter, Mary.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.810
- Hi.
- She's a good girl.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.579
She's at university.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.748
And, uh, she's very smart
like her mom.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.351
Is it, like, going on the telly?

01:59.353 --> 02:02.354
Mm-mm.
I'm not going on telly.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.524
No, it's just for internal...
Communications.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.292
- It's so they have a kind of resource.
- Okay.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.393
Mm-hmm.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.794
Oh, right, okay.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.163
Okay, I'm gonna change.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.264
All right, sweetie.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.166
Okay. See you in a bit.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.668
She's a bit shy.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.769
Can I get you guys a coffee

02:17.771 --> 02:19.438
or a tea or...?

02:21.341 --> 02:25.744
Well, I mean, obviously
she's incredibly inspiring.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.780
Um, I think,
especially nowadays,

02:28.782 --> 02:31.583
uh, to, like, have a mum who's

02:31.585 --> 02:36.421
the head of, you know, one of the
biggest international space agencies.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.257
Obviously, my mom's Canadian,

02:38.259 --> 02:39.825
um, but my dad was British.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.927
They met, uh, at university.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.930
He was doing a semester.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.533
He was very special,
very special man.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.568
He was a peacekeeper.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.802
Yeah.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.573
Yeah.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.409
We don't talk him that much,
I suppose.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.278
As much as we should.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.812
Oh, no.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.282
Um... I'm really sorry,
I think I have to get this.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.551
Just... sorry,
bear with me one moment.

03:07.387 --> 03:08.453
Hello?

03:11.391 --> 03:13.492
What?

03:13.494 --> 03:14.626
You're kidding me.

03:17.297 --> 03:21.667
Uh, no, I can be there
in about 25 minutes or so.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.835
Yeah, yeah, just, uh,
just hang tight.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.704
Ask... yeah, get Alex on it.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.340
Just tell...
Okay, good, he knows.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.709
No, no, no, just, uh,
just hang tight.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.345
Um, I'll be right there,
hang on. Okay.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.380
I'm so sorry, babe.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.381
Uh...

03:36.383 --> 03:37.583
Something has come up.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.585
I'm really sorry.
I have to go.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.922
ISS, be advised.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.459
Thermal increase detected
in nodes two and three.

03:47.461 --> 03:52.231
I repeat, thermal increase
detected in nodes two and three.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.934
Permission to attempt top hover
and reboot of node two.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.004
ISS, please confirm
to mission control

03:59.006 --> 04:02.274
when you are ready to proceed
with the module rack replacement.

04:02.276 --> 04:05.344
3va hatch in three, two, one.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.016
Unity node,
module visibility confirmed.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.719
Copy that, Jim.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.721
Jim to Francois, come in.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.558
Reading you loud and clear, Jim.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.995
Good 'cause you owe me
big time, over.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.997
ISS, copy that.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.765
Connecting additional
cable harnesses

04:26.767 --> 04:29.835
for electrical
and data systems rerouting.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.704
Fluid lines check confirmed
for thermal control.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.273
Copy that, Jim.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.441
Data systems routing
is good to go.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.713
Copy that. Making my way back...

04:39.813 --> 04:42.047
Receiving interference
with your last transmission.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.016
Can you please repeat?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.751
Can you confirm a strange sound

04:45.753 --> 04:48.053
being picked up by our radios?

04:48.055 --> 04:50.455
We don't recognize
that frequency band.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.792
Please check and confirm
if this is a comms breach.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.761
Uh, that's a negative.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.596
All radio frequency bands
are nominal.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.597
Whatever that sound is,

04:58.599 --> 05:00.532
it's not coming from us.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.804
Whoa.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.873
Mission control,
you seeing what I'm seeing?

05:07.875 --> 05:10.342
We seem to have lost
your video uplink.

05:10.344 --> 05:13.312
Please elaborate on
your last transmission.

05:13.314 --> 05:17.082
It looks like some kind
of solar storm disturbance.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.351
Francois, do you see this?

05:19.353 --> 05:20.986
Jim, I see it.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.755
Whatever that is, it's
disrupting our communication.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.358
Were there any solar storms
expected to be coming our way?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.559
That's a negative, Jim.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.494
No solar storms
have been reported.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.663
It looks like the fourth of July
up here right now.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.031
Heavy vibrations.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.566
I can see it on the panels.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.734
Whoa!

05:35.736 --> 05:37.836
Francois, engage the airlock.

05:39.073 --> 05:40.672
Airlock engaged.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.107
I'm making my way back, but...

05:42.109 --> 05:44.476
This is so bright,
I'm being blinded right now.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.579
Jim, it looks like your tether
is becoming unstable.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.848
We suggest you use the handle
grips to maneuver.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.450
I can feel tension
on this thing.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.984
I'm gonna have to disengage.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.419
I got to disconnect this thing
if I'm gonna get back.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.887
Jim...

05:55.889 --> 05:57.723
I can't see anything.
My tether...

05:57.725 --> 06:01.026
My tether, I can feel is tense.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.861
Come in, Jim.
Tell me what you see.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.536
It's still not known exactly

06:11.538 --> 06:13.605
what caused the power outage
on the ISS,

06:13.607 --> 06:16.775
but what's complexing is that

06:16.777 --> 06:18.577
all of the satellites
that were in orbit

06:18.579 --> 06:21.980
were affected at the exact same
moment as well.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.750
Now, of course,
the tragic outcome

06:24.752 --> 06:27.652
is that astronaut Jim Marcell
is currently missing,

06:27.654 --> 06:29.421
presumed dead.

06:29.423 --> 06:33.658
And... it's possible that
his tether was disconnected

06:33.660 --> 06:35.394
during the incident.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.898
Uh, well, firstly, I just...

06:39.900 --> 06:42.134
Want to say that, uh,
I've known Jim for a long time

06:42.136 --> 06:45.036
so, um, obviously this
is a very difficult time,

06:45.038 --> 06:47.439
but we've...
We've got to get on.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.641
We've got to find out
what happened.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.143
Um...

06:51.145 --> 06:54.746
We have a lot of footage
that's come down

06:54.748 --> 06:56.848
from, um, the ISS.

06:56.850 --> 07:01.420
And we've got a team now that's
going through that frame by frame,

07:01.422 --> 07:03.588
and we don't know
what it is yet.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.091
Uh, we do know that it's not
a solar flare,

07:06.093 --> 07:09.594
we know that it's not
an electrical storm.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.073
This isn't the first time

07:22.075 --> 07:24.810
that an anomaly has appeared
above our planet.

07:24.812 --> 07:28.013
We first encountered it in 1990.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.682
And it was visible
for about two months.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.051
But before we could get
any further data,

07:33.053 --> 07:35.020
any meaningful data,

07:35.022 --> 07:38.190
it vanished,
never to be seen again,

07:38.192 --> 07:39.758
until now.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.493
Yeah, good morning.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.861
Yeah.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.490
Yeah, I will update you
as soon as I'm in.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.667
Well, um...

07:48.669 --> 07:50.535
Basically, when I got the call,

07:50.537 --> 07:53.872
um, I'd been asleep
for about 45 minutes.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.974
I've been working on a project
for the last eight months,

07:55.976 --> 07:59.077
um, so it's been pretty intense.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.146
They wouldn't tell me
anything on the phone,

08:01.148 --> 08:03.081
space agency protocol,

08:03.083 --> 08:05.150
only that it was
of a classified nature,

08:05.152 --> 08:08.553
which requires my expertise in
the field of gravitational waves

08:08.555 --> 08:10.188
and space anomalies.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.058
The idea that this anomaly

08:13.060 --> 08:16.661
is emitting some form of
gravitational wave surprised us all,

08:16.663 --> 08:21.132
and it was definitely outside
anything predicted by science.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.536
What could cause
such a phenomena?

08:24.538 --> 08:27.272
I don't know yet.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.542
This morning,
the space agency reported that

08:30.544 --> 08:33.812
astronaut Jim Marcel was killed
by incoming space debris

08:33.813 --> 08:36.914
whilst on a maintenance mission
on the ISS.

08:36.917 --> 08:40.184
A space agency spokesperson
said this is a tragic incident.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.188
But Jim Marcell was
passionate about his job,

08:43.190 --> 08:45.290
and their condolences
go to his family.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.730
A name was given
to this anomaly.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.098
We started calling it
"the void",

08:53.100 --> 08:56.701
which is way better
than "anomaly 234-b."

08:56.703 --> 08:59.070
it had the appearance...

08:59.072 --> 09:01.773
Well, similar to the remnants
of a supernova.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.042
But, due to its proximity
to earth,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.678
we knew it was something
completely different.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.280
But during its appearance,

09:08.282 --> 09:11.917
we also detected
a short-burst radio wave

09:11.919 --> 09:14.085
and the signal was...
It was...

09:14.087 --> 09:16.821
Transmitted in a very
specific frequency,

09:16.823 --> 09:18.156
1420 megahertz.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.808
This 1420 megahertz frequency,

09:36.810 --> 09:40.145
a very strange
and complex phenomenon,

09:40.147 --> 09:41.880
also known as
the "hydrogen line,"

09:43.149 --> 09:45.183
the radio astronomers

09:45.185 --> 09:47.919
who first recorded it,

09:47.921 --> 09:51.656
they chased their tails trying
to find the source of the...

09:51.658 --> 09:53.158
Of the signal,

09:53.160 --> 09:54.826
to no avail.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.061
And then it disappeared.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.932
All these years later,

10:00.934 --> 10:03.101
we're still trying
to find the source.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.038
Never reoccurred.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.308
If we miss any opportunity
to investigate this now,

10:10.310 --> 10:14.145
we may have to wait for another
25 years for it to reappear,

10:14.147 --> 10:17.048
if it reappears.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.884
And what we need to know is,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.653
who put it there?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.089
Where did it come from?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.358
Is it intelligent?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.093
Is it trying to
communicate with us?

10:28.095 --> 10:31.062
I mean, these are the questions
that we need answers to.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.867
So we have reconnaissance
probes in orbit

10:35.869 --> 10:39.938
to do routine external examinations of
spacecraft and satellites in orbit,

10:39.940 --> 10:42.407
as well as
planetary exploration,

10:42.409 --> 10:44.042
when the time comes.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.044
So I made a call to authorize

10:46.046 --> 10:48.947
a probe be sent on a recon
mission into the void.

10:55.921 --> 10:58.857
Maneuvering in space
isn't quite as simple

10:58.859 --> 11:01.126
as it's often portrayed
in the movies.

11:01.128 --> 11:05.096
Um, to move from
one orbit to another

11:05.098 --> 11:07.232
takes quite a lot of energy.

11:07.234 --> 11:12.404
So we had to...
Adjust the craft's orbit

11:12.406 --> 11:17.175
to intersect
with that of the void.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.444
If something goes wrong here
with the probes,

11:19.446 --> 11:20.979
that might be it.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.882
It might be our only chance
to have a look.

12:30.883 --> 12:34.519
We always expected
to lose communication,

12:34.521 --> 12:38.857
just not necessarily that soon.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.826
But, thankfully,
all is not lost.

12:41.828 --> 12:45.363
Our probes are fitted with
state-of-the-art, high-definition cameras

12:45.365 --> 12:48.767
that stream directly
to our servers here.

12:48.769 --> 12:54.272
And, even in that brief,
briefest of windows,

12:54.274 --> 12:59.177
we were able
to maintain a signal,

12:59.179 --> 13:00.912
and we captured imagery.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.118
As our probe moved closer,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.954
we noticed this
tunnel-like structure,

13:09.956 --> 13:12.357
just directly ahead of us.

13:12.359 --> 13:16.094
Now, have a look at this
light at the center.

13:16.096 --> 13:21.199
This is light and cosmic matter
entering and leaving,

13:21.201 --> 13:24.402
so what we're potentially
looking at here

13:24.404 --> 13:26.471
is a wormhole.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.408
And, you know, we all know that
there is an entrance and an exit,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.577
so if this indeed a wormhole,

13:32.579 --> 13:34.813
then the next question is,

13:34.815 --> 13:38.116
what is on the other side
of the void?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.885
It looks like we're dealing
with a wormhole.

13:40.887 --> 13:43.154
We still need to run more data

13:43.156 --> 13:46.391
and have a look over all the
images that we've been sent back,

13:46.393 --> 13:50.829
just to know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.598
Technically, this is
not a wormhole, huh?

13:53.600 --> 13:56.234
Well, not in my opinion.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.303
In the case of the void...

13:58.305 --> 14:04.108
Well, we are sure
that an entry point exists.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.277
We call it "the throat."

14:06.279 --> 14:09.881
The question is whether
a second throat exists,

14:09.883 --> 14:11.850
an exit point.

14:11.852 --> 14:15.453
Would whatever we send in there
emerge the other side

14:15.455 --> 14:19.090
or would it remain stuck there
for eternity?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.262
Our finding was
a little bit like, uh,

14:24.264 --> 14:27.432
jumping and looking
over a really high wall,

14:27.434 --> 14:30.869
but only getting a glimpse
of what's on the other side.

14:30.871 --> 14:34.405
However, each time you jump, you
capture a little bit more information.

14:34.407 --> 14:40.111
And what began to emerge for us
was a kind of flash frame

14:40.113 --> 14:43.414
of what appeared to be a
spherical shape in the distance.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.184
Now, upon closer examination

14:46.186 --> 14:49.187
of this flash frame,

14:49.189 --> 14:54.959
we began to see the potential for
this spherical shape to be...

14:54.961 --> 14:56.194
Another planet.

15:01.267 --> 15:07.205
We could be looking at the first
contact with intelligent life.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.574
That is a major possibility
that we're looking at right now.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.144
Now we have something,

15:13.146 --> 15:16.080
something really big.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.283
Perhaps too big.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.451
I don't think we're prepared

15:20.453 --> 15:23.288
or have the resources
to investigate further.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.257
I mean,
something of this magnitude.

15:30.529 --> 15:33.298
I want to send
our astronauts up there.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.600
I understand what happened to Jim Marcell.
I can appreciate that.

15:35.602 --> 15:40.271
I want it noted
that I flatly object.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.274
I cannot support that.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.043
The reality is that
we have to get information.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.211
How are we going to get it?

15:47.213 --> 15:49.013
We can't continue
to send probes up there,

15:49.015 --> 15:51.182
they don't have the capability.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.185
We need to be in communication

15:54.187 --> 15:56.321
with somebody on the other side.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.057
Same conversation
for the next two years.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.327
If we miss the window,
we miss our opportunity.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.728
What stage are the probes at?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.330
What stage are we at
with their development?

16:05.332 --> 16:07.532
We've lost them.
They went through,

16:07.534 --> 16:09.367
and we have no signal
whatsoever.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.302
Totally interrupted,
totally blacked out.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.973
It say here that so far we've
lost a total of, uh,

16:14.975 --> 16:19.610
$3.5 million in technology
with the probes.

16:19.612 --> 16:23.081
It's not a bottom-line thing here,
we're not talking about a spreadsheet,

16:23.083 --> 16:26.417
we're talking about probably one of the
most important things that has happened

16:26.419 --> 16:28.987
in... in space exploration,

16:28.989 --> 16:30.488
and I think we need to
move forward on that

16:30.490 --> 16:32.223
and I think we need to
move forward now.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.458
What do you suggest?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.293
Our immediate focus

16:35.295 --> 16:37.628
is to define this mission.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.199
Several ideas were discussed, but nobody's
interested in sending more probes.

16:41.201 --> 16:45.003
The determination was to
finance a full mission.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.039
And we were able to raise
a large sum of funding.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.308
In fact, the largest sum
of funding ever raised

16:50.310 --> 16:53.211
in the history of
space exploration.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.413
Because...

16:55.415 --> 16:59.684
The mere glimpse of a
potentially habitable planet,

16:59.686 --> 17:03.354
well, I have to tell you, that
raised an awful lot of interest.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.457
Regardless, it was agreed upon
to keep this mission classified,

17:06.459 --> 17:07.592
for now.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.460
A complete media blackout,

17:09.462 --> 17:11.729
until we have
a greater understanding

17:11.731 --> 17:15.032
of what exactly it is
we're dealing with.

17:15.035 --> 17:18.502
The first step we took was to
provide a cover story to the media

17:18.505 --> 17:22.540
in order to provide a distraction
as part of the media blackout.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.343
In time, we will provide
full disclosure to the media,

17:25.345 --> 17:28.512
but, right now, the space agency
feels that the public

17:28.515 --> 17:32.683
is just not ready to know about
the mission involving the void.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.125
This notion of the...

17:41.127 --> 17:44.228
Space agency's
to send a human astronaut

17:44.230 --> 17:47.698
through to the other side...

17:47.700 --> 17:51.069
It's not going to happen.

17:51.071 --> 17:56.074
Because, physically,
we as human beings

17:56.076 --> 18:00.445
couldn't possibly endure
the extreme stresses

18:00.447 --> 18:03.748
that such a venture
would entail.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.783
For decades,
we've been developing suits

18:05.785 --> 18:09.153
to protect our astronauts
from the dangers of space.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.689
What we're gonna need
to do now to...

18:11.691 --> 18:15.793
To protect our astronauts from travelling
through the void is something...

18:15.795 --> 18:19.097
Quite frankly, I don't think we have
the technological capabilities to do.

18:21.266 --> 18:26.471
As I've implied
a few times before,

18:26.473 --> 18:32.376
sending a human astronaut
would be suicidal.

18:32.378 --> 18:36.514
In order to survive a wormhole,

18:36.516 --> 18:39.717
he or she would have to endure

18:39.719 --> 18:43.387
gravitational waves that would
spaghetti-fy them.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.359
The only feasible,

18:48.361 --> 18:50.661
though problematic, solution

18:50.663 --> 18:53.631
would be to use
robotics or probes.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.606
People all over the world
are reporting

19:35.608 --> 19:37.942
strange activities in the skies.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.444
Civilians from New York,
Australia and Asia

19:40.446 --> 19:42.180
are reporting what can
only be described

19:42.182 --> 19:44.448
as a terrifying distortion
of clouds.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.917
I think they're doing
some kind of project.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.886
Maybe they're testing some
new weather machine.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.488
It was pulsating.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.257
Like, with light kind of.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.426
It just, like... you could see
the clouds moving.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.861
It's really scary.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.603
We're receiving new data
from the void.

20:05.605 --> 20:06.837
We weren't expecting this.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.239
Not so soon.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.354
So over recent weeks,

20:23.356 --> 20:26.424
our orbiting satellites
have been observing the void

20:26.426 --> 20:29.860
and collecting
as much data as possible.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.830
We can see that the void
has been emitting

20:32.832 --> 20:35.299
a series of invisible waves.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.902
And it's this
invisible wavelength

20:37.904 --> 20:40.972
that has been
growing and expanding

20:40.974 --> 20:44.508
at a very, very fast rate.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.545
And we believe
that this activity

20:47.547 --> 20:49.413
occurred at the same time

20:49.415 --> 20:51.582
as the strange dark orbs

20:51.584 --> 20:54.652
that have been appearing
in our skies.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.521
So we have, um, run this
information through

20:57.523 --> 20:59.490
our simulator to predict
its activity

20:59.492 --> 21:01.559
based on what we currently know.

21:01.561 --> 21:06.831
The simulation is
forecasting a storm

21:06.833 --> 21:09.867
of invisible forces,

21:09.869 --> 21:12.837
which could consist of
dark matter and velocity fields

21:12.839 --> 21:16.641
and other unknown fields
and waves

21:16.643 --> 21:17.775
that we know nothing about.

21:19.578 --> 21:24.282
So when this storm reaches us,

21:24.284 --> 21:26.417
our planet will be in the midst

21:26.419 --> 21:30.855
of what could be
a huge cosmic wave.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.929
Since the appearance of
the black orbs in our skies,

21:38.931 --> 21:41.732
each nation's defense department
has declared the situation

21:41.734 --> 21:44.769
as a global security threat.

21:44.771 --> 21:48.005
The defense department reached
out to us in the space agency.

21:48.007 --> 21:52.510
They realized our problem with
sending astronauts through the void.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.011
They believed
they had a solution

21:54.013 --> 21:57.348
and they directed us to their
transhumanism division.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.659
When we learned about
the space agency's problem

22:41.661 --> 22:43.794
of sending astronauts
through the void,

22:43.796 --> 22:46.030
we offered our classified
technologies as a solution,

22:46.032 --> 22:49.667
but, frankly, I don't think
they have an alternative.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.036
Within the defense research
and tech divisions

22:52.038 --> 22:53.871
were classified programs,

22:53.873 --> 22:56.407
and they were taking place within
the areas of neuroscience,

22:56.409 --> 22:59.910
transhumanism and synthetic
biology for advanced soldiers.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.546
Now, you see, these programs
were classified

23:02.548 --> 23:04.048
for the obvious reasons
of ethics

23:04.050 --> 23:06.751
and were definitely not
sanctioned officially

23:06.753 --> 23:08.018
by the government as such.

23:10.989 --> 23:13.457
Particularly,
the human 2.0 program

23:13.459 --> 23:14.859
because the nature
of the technology,

23:14.861 --> 23:17.828
utilizing the fusion
of human cells

23:17.830 --> 23:20.131
with synthetic biochemical
structures

23:20.133 --> 23:24.735
to create a new body powered by
the soldier's preserved brain.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.843
The brain can live
without a body,

23:32.845 --> 23:35.613
but the body can't live
without its brain.

23:35.615 --> 23:39.850
It's that simple notion which
drives the human 2.0 project.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.586
Our aim was to
create a prosthesis

23:42.588 --> 23:44.622
that could house
the human brain,

23:44.624 --> 23:46.590
a substitute body.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.760
But most importantly,
we wanted it to be recognizable

23:49.762 --> 23:51.028
as a human.

23:54.566 --> 23:57.168
Okay, I'm gonna up the back
if you want to have a look.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.776
Okay, so this compartment
here's gonna house the brain.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.946
And you see the red
jell-o-looking substance here?

24:08.948 --> 24:10.915
So that's actually
a coolant gel,

24:10.917 --> 24:12.950
and it travels
throughout the body,

24:12.952 --> 24:16.053
and it houses millions
of tiny fiber optic threads

24:16.055 --> 24:19.623
connecting the brain right down
to all the synthetic muscles,

24:19.625 --> 24:22.760
and even to really
superficial sensors.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.662
But the brain's gonna
sit in here.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.964
And the gel also acts
as a shock absorber,

24:26.966 --> 24:31.202
so should the human 2.0
receive any impact,

24:31.204 --> 24:34.505
the gel will dissipate any force
protecting the brain.

24:36.107 --> 24:37.775
But here let me,
let me show you this.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.243
Okay.

24:42.781 --> 24:45.015
Don't worry, he's not alive.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.017
That's just a synaptic
nerve reflex.

24:47.019 --> 24:50.921
Uh... but a transplant hasn't
been made into this body yet,

24:50.923 --> 24:54.058
so, essentially,
it's just a body.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.528
Um... it's like... a bit like
a computer without a hard drive.

25:04.536 --> 25:07.271
In the recent week, we have
covertly searched the globe

25:07.273 --> 25:11.842
for candidates who are willing
to push the barriers of science.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.513
Now, officially, the selected
candidates will be on a mission

25:15.515 --> 25:18.916
to the international space
station to conduct research.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.152
However, once the transplant
takes place,

25:22.154 --> 25:24.755
they can never return
to the lives they left behind.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.993
Their families will be informed

25:28.995 --> 25:31.829
and will be given
an appropriate explanation

25:31.831 --> 25:36.066
that will, of course, protect the
mission and the space agency.

25:36.068 --> 25:39.136
A closed-casket funeral
will take place

25:39.138 --> 25:41.872
to provide closure
to the families.

25:44.109 --> 25:47.311
Now, for the record, um...

25:47.313 --> 25:49.647
Do you understand the classified
nature of this mission

25:49.649 --> 25:52.917
and the legal non-disclosure
agreements that you sign,

25:52.919 --> 25:56.053
which prohibit you from ever
discussing this projects

25:56.055 --> 25:57.755
to anyone outside of this room?

25:57.757 --> 25:59.657
I understand.

25:59.659 --> 26:02.593
Then you understand
the full nature of this program?

26:02.595 --> 26:04.828
Yes, I'm fully aware.

26:04.830 --> 26:07.598
And what do you feel
your strongest asset is

26:07.600 --> 26:09.833
that'd you be bringing
to this mission?

26:09.835 --> 26:14.104
I'm hoping to bring to this
mission my virology expertise.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.073
Military background,

26:16.075 --> 26:18.208
and in the short time I've been
in the space program,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.311
I have rised the ranks faster

26:20.313 --> 26:23.581
than anyone in the history
of the space program.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.882
But you know this.

26:24.884 --> 26:28.686
It's... it's the unknown.

26:28.688 --> 26:32.356
It's the possibility of
something else out there for us.

26:32.358 --> 26:36.594
Even though there's some...

26:36.596 --> 26:40.731
Pretty scary risks...

26:40.733 --> 26:46.003
To know that there's a chance
to do so much more.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.672
Well, I think it's in our nature

26:48.674 --> 26:51.842
to want to rise
above our limits.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.778
I feel that I want to do
something great, you know?

26:54.780 --> 26:58.148
Like, I want to be like my dad
and be remembered for something.

27:03.221 --> 27:06.924
Sure, I've spent
the great majority of my life

27:06.926 --> 27:10.027
in a chair.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.763
Half of my body does not work,

27:12.765 --> 27:14.331
I do not want sympathy for that.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.167
I have come to terms with that.

27:17.169 --> 27:20.971
I've made my peace with that.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.873
Sure, for...

27:22.875 --> 27:26.710
Also for most of my life,
I have dreamed

27:26.712 --> 27:31.281
of being and doing
something more.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.951
And part of coming to terms
with my situation

27:33.953 --> 27:36.153
is resigning myself
to the fact that that,

27:36.155 --> 27:38.956
that is not something that could
happen, happen for me.

27:38.958 --> 27:43.160
I will not... be...

27:43.162 --> 27:46.196
The person I thought I could be.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.698
What you're doing
right now, sir,

27:47.700 --> 27:48.999
is presenting me with a chance

27:49.001 --> 27:51.669
to fulfill that dream,

27:51.671 --> 27:53.904
that desire.

27:53.906 --> 27:57.007
I have cancer, I...

27:57.009 --> 28:00.244
If my body is limiting me,
then I need to go beyond that.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.079
This is the only way
I can do it.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.414
Are you sure that you're aware

28:03.416 --> 28:05.215
that this is...

28:05.217 --> 28:06.917
A one-way ticket?

28:06.919 --> 28:09.987
We select, not only
on physical prowess,

28:09.989 --> 28:12.823
but also on
the ability to emote,

28:12.825 --> 28:16.760
to... to be empathetic.

28:16.762 --> 28:20.064
Could I go through
with the procedure?

28:20.066 --> 28:23.133
There's just too many ethical
issues to think about.

28:23.135 --> 28:26.203
There would have to be
a massive, massive reason

28:26.205 --> 28:28.338
for me to go ahead
with something like that.

28:28.340 --> 28:31.408
And, uh, I can't think of one.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.311
So, no, couldn't do it.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.922
The subjects would have
to pass a series of tests

28:44.924 --> 28:48.292
as well as internal exams
from our psychologist,

28:48.294 --> 28:52.029
and fitness and medical checks.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.798
The process in itself
is painless.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.401
The subject will be administered
a cocktail of drugs

28:57.403 --> 28:59.203
by I.V. Drips,

28:59.205 --> 29:02.372
which will stop the heart
for a few hours.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.309
Simulating a peaceful death.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.177
The most time-consuming part

29:07.179 --> 29:12.883
is the wiring up, the remapping
of the artificial spinal cords,

29:12.885 --> 29:16.353
connecting to the brain, thus
allowing for mind-body communication

29:16.355 --> 29:17.821
to function,

29:17.823 --> 29:20.457
very much like it does
in each of us.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.760
What you need to
understand is...

29:22.762 --> 29:24.161
It's this fusion process

29:24.163 --> 29:26.130
where the, where the brain

29:26.132 --> 29:29.133
imprints with the synthetic body
and comes together,

29:29.135 --> 29:32.970
that's the creation
of the human 2.0.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.072
That's the marvel.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.306
But we must remember,

29:36.308 --> 29:39.476
these human 2.0s
aren't entirely mortal.

29:39.478 --> 29:43.347
The brain also degenerates
over a period of time.

29:43.349 --> 29:47.918
Now... the difference
being that, unlike humans,

29:47.920 --> 29:49.820
their bodies last much longer,

29:49.822 --> 29:51.922
so the period of life
is extended for much longer,

29:51.924 --> 29:54.958
but not forever.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.862
The vetting process for the human
2.0 program is extremely high.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.298
Basically these candidates
will become ambassadors,

30:01.300 --> 30:03.901
representing the human race
on the other side,

30:03.903 --> 30:07.838
and are selected based on their
extraordinary cognitive abilities.

30:19.851 --> 30:24.254
We only have two synthetics
available for this program,

30:24.256 --> 30:28.091
so the selection process
has been extremely critical.

30:28.093 --> 30:30.594
We've decided to action
the first transplant

30:30.596 --> 30:34.198
before making
the second selection.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.400
For the first transplant,

30:36.402 --> 30:38.502
uh, Carl Roberts.

30:38.504 --> 30:42.539
He's, um, not as academic
perhaps as the other candidates,

30:42.541 --> 30:46.443
but his cognitive skills
are, are...

30:46.445 --> 30:49.213
Beyond our expectations.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.582
When I opened that bit of paper,
it-it...

30:51.584 --> 30:53.417
It contained the information
I wanted it to

30:53.419 --> 30:55.385
and I was accepted.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.887
Man.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.455
Yeah, that is everything
I wanted, man.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.490
I'm... I didn't know if I'd said

31:00.492 --> 31:03.060
everything I needed to say
in that interview.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.295
I can't describe the excitement
I feel right now.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.964
I mean, I'm gonna
get out of this chair.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.199
I'm ready.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.267
Bring it on.

31:11.636 --> 31:14.338
He has a certain hunger

31:14.340 --> 31:16.940
that this requires.

31:16.942 --> 31:19.309
It's that, um...

31:19.311 --> 31:23.313
Sense of adventure that
will drive this mission.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.149
And we're very,
very pleased that, uh,

31:26.151 --> 31:27.317
that he's on board.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.392
Today I'm having
a full-body scan

31:35.394 --> 31:37.094
to allow the human 2.0 body

31:37.096 --> 31:40.230
to be as close to me as
possible, warts and all.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.000
Apparently, the agents think that
if first contact to be made,

31:43.002 --> 31:45.302
then it should be in human form

31:45.304 --> 31:48.205
so that the extraterrestrials
would know what we look like.

31:48.207 --> 31:51.441
It's, uh, it's lucky I'm so
attractive, don't you think?

31:58.416 --> 32:01.251
So the bodyshell is
a breakthrough

32:01.253 --> 32:03.587
in nanomaterial technology.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.622
It's made of
a military-grade grapheme,

32:05.624 --> 32:07.991
so millions of its tiny fibers

32:07.993 --> 32:11.695
are woven to make
the bodyshell impenetrable,

32:11.697 --> 32:15.198
yet it can also maintain
a flexibility,

32:15.200 --> 32:17.434
which is important
for some areas,

32:17.436 --> 32:20.504
uh, such as the joints.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.340
Its eyes use nano-based optics,

32:23.342 --> 32:27.577
which allow the retina to adjust to
several different lighting conditions.

32:27.579 --> 32:31.048
And, yeah, you are
probably wondering why

32:31.050 --> 32:33.317
the human 2.0 is breathing.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.652
Uh, well, this is just
one of the many features

32:35.654 --> 32:38.989
incorporated to help
feel more familiar.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.458
The breathing effect
is actually caused by

32:41.460 --> 32:44.294
a mechanism within
the synthetic body, um,

32:44.296 --> 32:46.330
to help with thermal regulation.

32:46.332 --> 32:50.334
A tight regulation of glucose
and oxygen metabolism

32:50.336 --> 32:53.370
is essential for
brain physiology.

32:53.372 --> 32:57.407
So we developed a compound
called "z02h",

32:57.409 --> 33:01.478
which releases tiny amounts
of electrochems into the brain.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.314
This compound, essentially,

33:04.316 --> 33:07.451
it mimics the properties
of glucose and oxygen,

33:07.453 --> 33:11.588
therefore fueling the brain and
keeping it alive organically.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.405
The original design
of the spacecraft

33:28.407 --> 33:30.640
was intended
for human astronauts,

33:30.642 --> 33:34.678
so we now stripped it bare
of any hardware or technology

33:34.680 --> 33:36.380
needed for life-support systems,

33:36.382 --> 33:39.649
as the 2.0 human group
won't need it,

33:39.651 --> 33:43.420
therefore making it
smaller and lighter,

33:43.422 --> 33:46.123
which means it's faster

33:46.125 --> 33:48.358
and it uses less fuel.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.527
They will be jacked
into the sockets

33:50.529 --> 33:52.763
so that we can monitor
their diagnostics.

33:52.765 --> 33:56.199
But it also means that
we can feed information

33:56.201 --> 33:59.269
directly into their
cerebral cortex.

33:59.271 --> 34:02.406
I mean, that's a remarkable
thing, don't you think?

34:09.614 --> 34:13.516
First contact, of course, is of the
utmost importance, how it's presented.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.318
Concern for us:

34:15.320 --> 34:17.621
What are we communicating to?

34:17.623 --> 34:20.489
What exactly are
we going to discover

34:20.492 --> 34:23.226
when we make contact with a...

34:23.228 --> 34:26.663
Intelligent extraterrestrial
life form?

34:26.665 --> 34:30.534
Are we thinking in terms
of a human?

34:30.536 --> 34:33.136
Um... perhaps a microbe?

34:33.138 --> 34:35.172
It's very, very difficult
for us.

34:35.174 --> 34:39.376
So what we've done is we've put
together a golden archive drive.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.712
This is an upgrade,
it has, um, more visuals,

34:42.714 --> 34:46.283
more sound, videos.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.386
And, uh, well, hopefully,
when we do make first contact,

34:49.388 --> 34:51.688
we will be able to communicate.

34:51.690 --> 34:56.626
And all of the images,
the sounds, uh...

34:56.628 --> 34:59.396
An essence of who we are,

34:59.398 --> 35:02.165
and our intention.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.269
Oh, no, no, no,
it's good, it's good.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.337
I'm all right, sir.

35:14.412 --> 35:15.879
- Thank you.
- There you go.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.149
Vitals look good.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.585
Yes, sir, everything works.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.587
Waist up.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.388
Have you been made aware
of the actual proceeding?

35:25.390 --> 35:26.690
- Come here.
- Thank you.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.492
Have you been made aware
of the procedure?

35:28.494 --> 35:29.526
Uh, I think so.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.161
I think, uh...

35:31.163 --> 35:32.629
Yeah, quite a bit I don't know.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.332
Okay, well, let me take you
through it step by step.

35:35.334 --> 35:39.769
The only level of,
let's say, um...

35:39.771 --> 35:41.805
Un-comfortability that
you might experience is,

35:41.807 --> 35:44.307
just at the very beginning,
we need to make an incision

35:44.309 --> 35:48.778
just around here to be able to
gain access into the spinal cord.

35:48.780 --> 35:52.582
You have to look at this
as a procedure.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.418
Not everything is going to
happen straight away.

35:55.420 --> 35:59.356
The actual time taken will be
right about three days.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.492
Your awareness begins to
fade very slowly,

36:02.494 --> 36:04.461
and your heart rate
will begin to slow down.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.663
As the heart rate slows down,

36:06.665 --> 36:10.267
your level of consciousness
will actually expand,

36:10.269 --> 36:12.202
before then beginning
to come down.

36:12.204 --> 36:13.937
Okay, so I'll just fade,
fade out.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.939
That's one...

36:15.941 --> 36:17.908
That's one of being able to...

36:17.910 --> 36:19.776
I go to sleep.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.478
It's a very peaceful sleep.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.547
- All right.
- A very peaceful sleep.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.282
I guess this is
my last interview

36:25.284 --> 36:28.351
before I transplant
into the new body.

36:28.353 --> 36:33.590
I wanted to...
Go out into space,

36:33.592 --> 36:36.393
and live there forever
among the stars.

36:40.565 --> 36:44.434
And he told me...

36:44.436 --> 36:46.970
That I could do whatever
I wanted to do.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.441
As long as I put my mind to it.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.781
So...

36:57.783 --> 36:59.349
This is for you, dad.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.413
The military have been
doing recon fly-bys

37:30.415 --> 37:32.449
to get a closer look
at the spheres.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.918
Now what's complexing
is that the spheres

37:34.920 --> 37:37.821
don't seem to be reacting to us.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.657
The space agency has convinced
leaders of key nations

37:40.659 --> 37:44.361
not to initiate an attack
without us analyzing the data

37:44.363 --> 37:46.963
to further understand
what the spheres are

37:46.965 --> 37:49.766
and what is their connection
to the void.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.935
Our advanced satellite
geomapping indicates

37:51.937 --> 37:55.438
that the spheres are scattered
across the entire globe.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.340
Although we don't have
an accurate number,

37:57.342 --> 37:59.943
it's estimated that there are
hundreds of these spheres,

37:59.945 --> 38:01.611
floating in our skies,

38:01.613 --> 38:03.913
with more appearing every day.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.749
The geomapping also revealed
a pattern

38:05.751 --> 38:08.285
within the formation
of the spheres.

38:08.287 --> 38:11.554
It's... it's as if
they are aligning themselves

38:11.556 --> 38:13.623
in preparation for something.

38:22.433 --> 38:23.967
At 8:35 this morning,

38:23.969 --> 38:28.938
our first human 2.0 transplant
attempt... failed.

38:31.375 --> 38:33.910
Our subject was pronounced dead.

38:54.098 --> 38:56.733
There will be a second attempt
tonight, I presume.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.647
I'm devastated.

39:10.649 --> 39:14.484
We lost someone who was so
supportive of this mission,

39:14.486 --> 39:17.420
of this... of this cause.

39:22.727 --> 39:25.595
But we're losing time.

39:25.597 --> 39:29.032
We have to launch
within a week, and...

39:29.034 --> 39:31.434
We can't afford
to lose that window.

39:31.436 --> 39:34.137
Carl's transplant revealed that

39:34.139 --> 39:38.108
the brain couldn't fuse
with the synthetic body.

39:38.110 --> 39:41.678
And it rejected it
during the fusion process.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.680
And, pretty much,

39:43.682 --> 39:45.648
scrambled the brain
synapsis badly.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.817
The brain just overloaded.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.759
To prevent another loss,

39:55.761 --> 39:58.661
uh, the idea is to update

39:58.663 --> 40:01.831
the original synthetic
body printing technology

40:01.833 --> 40:05.769
with a new integrated tissue
organ printing system.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.772
Introducing a tiny amount
of the subject's actual cells

40:08.774 --> 40:10.573
into the synthetic gel

40:10.575 --> 40:12.542
means the brain can make
the connection

40:12.544 --> 40:15.478
with something organic
and not freak out

40:15.480 --> 40:18.114
when it comes into contact
with a foreign body structure

40:18.116 --> 40:20.850
it's not used to during
the fusion process.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.161
My professional opinion?

40:31.163 --> 40:33.997
This whole thing
is being rushed.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.632
We need more time.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.000
Uh...

40:37.002 --> 40:40.503
Look, the only way
that this could work,

40:40.505 --> 40:43.440
the... the feasibility of it,

40:43.442 --> 40:46.509
is to ensure that the human
transplant is tested

40:46.511 --> 40:48.812
with the enzyme beforehand.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.881
We would need to test
each candidate.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.983
But this would require
several months.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.819
We don't have months
or even weeks,

40:55.821 --> 40:58.488
we're really up against it.

40:58.490 --> 41:01.191
We have the military human 2.0s,
we should deploy with them.

41:03.093 --> 41:06.496
Sending one military human 2.0
is one thing,

41:06.498 --> 41:09.499
but sending two as a replacement

41:09.501 --> 41:12.669
to our astronauts...

41:12.671 --> 41:15.672
Well, I think you have
to ask yourself,

41:15.674 --> 41:18.475
"do we want soldiers
representing humanity,

41:18.477 --> 41:20.076
especially in that
state of mind?"

41:20.078 --> 41:22.479
And I can confidently tell you
that that is not something

41:22.481 --> 41:24.848
that I am comfortable with.

41:24.850 --> 41:27.650
Thankfully, I have been advised
by my medical science team

41:27.652 --> 41:30.019
that there is
a potential solution

41:30.021 --> 41:31.788
which would fit in
our timeframe.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.823
Ever since our probes have been
sending back samples

41:33.825 --> 41:36.926
from the moon mining missions,
the Mars rover missions,

41:36.928 --> 41:39.596
those samples have been
kept in storage

41:39.598 --> 41:42.031
in the space agency facility.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.901
As protocol,
we take blood samples

41:44.903 --> 41:48.137
and urine samples
of all space agency staff

41:48.139 --> 41:52.075
to monitor any radiation effects
coming from the labs.

41:52.077 --> 41:55.612
And this protocol is, in part,
us keeping our team safe,

41:55.614 --> 41:59.816
but also conforming to science and
technology workplace regulations.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.056
Out of the entire agency,

42:07.058 --> 42:10.193
only three came up with
a positive match for the enzyme.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.929
One is an astronaut who's
just come back from the ISS,

42:12.931 --> 42:15.231
the other is our head of I.T.,

42:15.233 --> 42:18.067
and the other is our
expert cosmologist

42:18.069 --> 42:20.603
on the subject of the void,

42:20.605 --> 42:22.038
Jessica Johnson.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.554
Yeah, can I take your coat?

42:37.556 --> 42:39.956
Oh, yeah, lovely, thanks.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.558
- That's it.
- Yeah, great.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.660
- How's things? How's Mary?
- Good, she's good.

42:43.662 --> 42:46.296
- It's really nice to have her back.
- Oh.

42:46.298 --> 42:48.765
- I haven't seen her for a little while, so...
- Yeah, she...

42:58.208 --> 43:00.610
- Hey!
- Hey, how are you?

43:00.612 --> 43:02.011
Yeah, I'm good.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.646
- A long time.
- I'm laden with a cat.

43:03.648 --> 43:05.348
Yeah. Aw.

43:05.350 --> 43:06.683
So good to see you.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.820
Um, when am I gonna
see you again?

43:10.822 --> 43:12.822
Um, I don't know.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.591
- Soon?
- Um... yeah, soon.

43:14.593 --> 43:16.125
- Sooner than, sooner than...
- Yeah, definitely soon.

43:16.127 --> 43:17.694
- ...this time, okay?
- And I promise,

43:17.696 --> 43:19.696
I will definitely text you back.

43:19.698 --> 43:21.230
Okay. Enjoy the puzzle.

43:21.232 --> 43:22.865
- Good luck. I'll see you.
- I'll be back around 8:00.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.300
Good luck, Mary, take care.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.669
Yeah.

43:26.671 --> 43:27.937
Obviously,
you know why I'm here.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.005
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.206
Um, and to be honest,

43:30.208 --> 43:32.709
I'm having some
reservations myself.

43:32.711 --> 43:34.043
Of course.

43:34.045 --> 43:38.214
I'm coming to you
sort of off the record

43:38.216 --> 43:41.184
- and as a friend more than a colleague. Um...
- Mm.

43:41.186 --> 43:45.822
I respect that and I get that this is
a really difficult decision for you

43:45.824 --> 43:48.291
as much as it is for me,
I know that.

43:48.293 --> 43:51.327
And I... I want to make
the right decision

43:51.329 --> 43:54.764
that I'm better going ahead
with the procedure

43:54.766 --> 43:58.801
- than... my knowledge being here.
- Mm.

43:58.803 --> 44:04.240
But also... there's no way back.

44:04.242 --> 44:05.675
There is no way back.

44:05.677 --> 44:07.844
And...

44:07.846 --> 44:09.212
I'm sorry, but, um...

44:09.214 --> 44:12.248
Excuse me.

44:12.250 --> 44:14.717
I need to make sure my family
are really well cared for.

44:14.719 --> 44:16.819
- That I can guarantee.
- Yeah?

44:16.821 --> 44:19.656
I can guarantee that your family
will be taken care of.

44:19.658 --> 44:23.026
And it needs to...

44:23.028 --> 44:24.661
Be delicate,
the way you tell them.

44:24.663 --> 44:26.362
I will be sensitive.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.064
- Thank you.
- Of course.

44:28.066 --> 44:30.433
You don't need to
worry about that.

44:30.435 --> 44:32.068
This can't be for nothing.

44:32.070 --> 44:35.838
And I'm aware that
we've got one shot at this,

44:35.840 --> 44:38.408
- and time is running out.
- Yes, it is running out.

44:38.410 --> 44:41.244
It's... it's very pressing.

44:41.246 --> 44:43.680
You know, you will go down
in history books

44:43.682 --> 44:48.351
for what you, potentially,
if you agree to do it.

44:48.353 --> 44:53.289
Well, Jessica is faced with
a very difficult decision.

44:53.291 --> 44:58.695
She is the best candidate that
we have at the present time

44:58.697 --> 45:02.198
to participate in
the human 2.0 project.

45:02.200 --> 45:06.069
Of course... it's not
an easy choice to make.

45:06.071 --> 45:09.739
I don't really know...

45:09.741 --> 45:11.107
I really don't know
how to convince her

45:11.109 --> 45:13.109
to make this choice.

45:13.111 --> 45:17.380
I feel terribly conflicted

45:17.382 --> 45:21.417
because we all know that...

45:21.419 --> 45:25.054
Her life will change
irrevocably.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.290
And, uh...

45:27.292 --> 45:30.193
There's no guarantee
that she will, um,

45:30.195 --> 45:33.029
you know, make it out
of this process alive.

45:33.031 --> 45:36.899
It's a very big
responsibility for me.

45:36.901 --> 45:40.269
And it's, uh,
ultimately, up to her.

45:52.015 --> 45:53.750
- I'm going to do it.
- What?

45:53.752 --> 45:55.218
It makes perfect sense.

45:55.220 --> 45:57.019
I know this mission
more than anyone here

45:57.021 --> 45:59.222
and I understand the objective.

45:59.224 --> 46:00.890
I'm the only person here
who understands

46:00.892 --> 46:02.599
what could potentially
be on the other side.

46:05.462 --> 46:08.231
You don't have to do this.

46:08.233 --> 46:10.233
You're much more
valuable to us down here.

46:10.235 --> 46:13.236
Well, given the tight timeframe,

46:13.238 --> 46:17.473
you know that this is
the right thing to do.

46:17.475 --> 46:20.877
Look, we'll have to run tests. And besides,
we have the other two positive candidates.

46:20.879 --> 46:23.079
- What makes you think...?
- The astronaut, James good,

46:23.081 --> 46:24.814
firstly, just back from the ISS,

46:24.816 --> 46:27.917
secondly, he has a family.

46:27.919 --> 46:29.819
And David Jennings in I.T.,
I mean, seriously,

46:29.821 --> 46:31.888
the guy is so defensive.

46:31.890 --> 46:34.357
Definitely not
first contact material.

46:34.359 --> 46:35.825
I've already done the psych test

46:35.827 --> 46:38.427
and I'm cleared
for the procedure.

46:38.429 --> 46:40.530
Now I haven't worked
directly with her,

46:40.532 --> 46:42.832
but in light of
recent communications,

46:42.834 --> 46:46.302
it's clear that she's volatile
and, frankly,

46:46.304 --> 46:48.971
a ticking time bomb.

46:48.973 --> 46:52.108
I don't think we should have
someone like that

46:52.110 --> 46:54.877
lead a scientific investigation

46:54.879 --> 46:58.381
in what could possibly be
the most important discovery

46:58.383 --> 47:02.985
in the history
of space exploration.

47:05.290 --> 47:07.423
She has, um,
this ability to focus

47:07.425 --> 47:10.026
and this attention
that she applies to her work,

47:10.028 --> 47:12.028
which is very impressive.

47:12.030 --> 47:14.030
And she has this
exploratory nature

47:14.032 --> 47:15.965
with veering that she does.

47:15.967 --> 47:19.602
Always looking deeper into ever
anomaly that she's researching,

47:19.604 --> 47:21.370
drawing conclusions
from the data

47:21.372 --> 47:23.172
and, and thinking about things

47:23.174 --> 47:27.410
in a way that's very
valuable and unique.

47:27.412 --> 47:30.880
And, really, I think Jessica's
the ideal person

47:30.882 --> 47:32.081
for this mission.

47:36.386 --> 47:39.889
When Jessica was
making her decision,

47:39.891 --> 47:43.025
she came to me
to find out more about

47:43.027 --> 47:47.163
what it was gonna be like
in the human 2.0 body.

47:47.165 --> 47:51.434
So, obviously, we discussed
the physical differences,

47:51.436 --> 47:56.639
but she was more concerned about
her emotional capabilities.

47:56.641 --> 47:59.175
And I reassured her,
um, you know,

47:59.177 --> 48:02.311
this is the most important
aspect to us;

48:02.313 --> 48:05.214
preserving her
emotional intelligence

48:05.216 --> 48:07.650
and, in a moral compass,

48:07.652 --> 48:10.086
you know, that's what
makes you human.

48:10.088 --> 48:14.624
And it's a human that
we want to send up there.

48:14.626 --> 48:17.260
Well, it's, um,
absolutely incredible

48:17.262 --> 48:18.928
what they can do.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.297
Um, it's very overwhelming.

48:21.299 --> 48:23.566
Um, but Alice was wonderful.

48:23.568 --> 48:28.404
She told me exactly what is
entailed with the procedure.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.606
Um, I know a bit more
about it now.

48:30.608 --> 48:32.375
Um...

48:32.377 --> 48:35.144
It's... it's incredible.
I'm ready.

48:35.146 --> 48:38.314
Um, I absolutely
have to do this.

48:38.316 --> 48:40.616
And, uh, yeah.

48:45.522 --> 48:48.324
The hardest part
of this decision

48:48.326 --> 48:50.559
to go ahead with the procedure

48:50.561 --> 48:53.663
has been calling up
my friends and family

48:53.665 --> 48:57.566
to just hear their voice
one last time.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.635
These phone calls

48:59.637 --> 49:04.006
really made me realize
the sacrifices I'm making.

49:11.114 --> 49:14.083
Even if I do survive it,

49:14.085 --> 49:17.186
I am well aware that
this is a one-way mission

49:17.188 --> 49:21.290
and there is no point of return
to my original life.

50:19.483 --> 50:23.185
The fusion has been successful.

50:23.187 --> 50:27.590
We have our first human 2.0.

50:27.592 --> 50:30.393
We are literally god right now.

50:44.307 --> 50:47.309
When I watched her eyes open,

50:47.311 --> 50:51.380
and when I saw her
take her first breath,

50:51.382 --> 50:55.651
it, uh... it was like
she was reborn.

50:55.653 --> 50:57.686
But it's like you're watching
consciousness come alive

50:57.688 --> 50:59.488
right in front of you.

50:59.490 --> 51:02.124
And this unprecedented mix of,

51:02.126 --> 51:05.294
of human consciousness
and technology.

51:07.498 --> 51:09.665
Okay, guys,
can you check on this?

51:09.667 --> 51:13.169
Okay, Jessica,
just calm down, it's okay.

51:13.171 --> 51:16.405
The speech synthesizer, it needs
the reconfiguration, okay?

51:16.407 --> 51:19.208
But just calm down,
this isn't permanent.

51:19.210 --> 51:20.443
We can fix this, okay?

51:20.445 --> 51:23.379
But try, try and relax yourself.

51:23.381 --> 51:26.682
Uh, so we're having some issues
with the speech synthesizer.

51:26.684 --> 51:29.318
Basically, the electrode
that's implanted in the brain,

51:29.320 --> 51:32.555
which is communicating telemetrically
with the neural decoder,

51:32.557 --> 51:34.423
this is where, I think,
we're having some issues.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.525
We need to do some
reconfiguration here.

51:49.773 --> 51:52.641
Strange hearing my voice.

51:52.643 --> 51:54.643
I don't feel like myself.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.679
But I'm just in a new body.

51:56.681 --> 52:02.384
My... I can feel pressure when
I touch my fingertips together.

52:02.386 --> 52:05.454
But I don't have
any sense of pain.

52:05.456 --> 52:09.425
When I look in the mirror,
I see my old face,

52:09.427 --> 52:11.427
only inside a new body.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.762
Sometimes, when I close my eyes,

52:13.764 --> 52:17.166
I totally forget that I am
in a synthetic body.

52:17.168 --> 52:19.335
Everything which makes me
who I am,

52:19.337 --> 52:21.804
it's in my consciousness.

52:21.806 --> 52:25.875
I'm told that I will have to go
through extensive rehabilitation

52:25.877 --> 52:30.779
to get my brain used to
the synthetic body.

52:33.884 --> 52:37.820
After the first time,
when we lost Carl,

52:37.822 --> 52:42.224
I sometimes doubted
that we'd be here today.

52:42.226 --> 52:44.260
Seeing her now,

52:44.262 --> 52:46.162
alive...

52:46.164 --> 52:47.563
It changes everything.

52:47.565 --> 52:50.866
That's, um, that's so profound.

52:50.868 --> 52:55.571
Sorry, I find it really,
um... staggering.

52:55.573 --> 52:58.908
And I suppose mixed in
with that is, uh...

52:58.910 --> 53:03.312
The fact that she is a woman,
a human being like you and me.

53:03.314 --> 53:05.347
Um...

53:05.349 --> 53:08.784
And she must be wondering how
it's all gonna work out as well.

53:08.786 --> 53:13.355
But I think
she's gonna be just fine.

53:13.357 --> 53:17.226
I would suggest that this is
the beginning of the future

53:17.228 --> 53:19.862
of astronauts to come.

53:28.271 --> 53:30.372
I won't deny the fact

53:30.374 --> 53:34.243
that our human 2.0 solider may
possess certain hardware attributes

53:34.245 --> 53:35.711
within its synthetic body,

53:35.713 --> 53:38.614
which will differ from
the synthetic astronaut.

53:38.616 --> 53:40.549
Yes, he is carrying small arms,

53:40.551 --> 53:43.485
which is part of the human 2.0
soldier body design.

53:43.487 --> 53:46.555
You don't send a soldier
on a mission without a weapon

53:46.557 --> 53:49.592
and considering that we do not
know what is behind the void,

53:49.594 --> 53:52.428
it is inherently dangerous
to be unprepared.

54:17.854 --> 54:20.589
Human 2.0 has just docked on
and looking good.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.691
Prepare for launch countdown.

54:29.566 --> 54:32.901
Five, four, three, two, one.

54:36.473 --> 54:38.874
We have ignition, engines start.

54:38.876 --> 54:41.543
Lift off.

54:44.014 --> 54:46.415
Power is nominal.

54:46.417 --> 54:50.019
Engines at 101% and nominal.

54:50.021 --> 54:53.322
Altitude is 2,000 feet
and climbing.

54:53.324 --> 54:56.392
Avionics power is at nominal.

54:56.394 --> 55:00.529
Altitude is at 10,000 feet
and climbing.

55:00.531 --> 55:02.064
Engines remain nominal.

55:02.066 --> 55:04.667
Preparing for main engine
cut off.

55:04.669 --> 55:06.735
Two minutes to EPOS.

55:06.737 --> 55:09.071
Sequence 30 seconds.

55:09.073 --> 55:12.641
Speed, 7,200 miles per hour.

55:12.643 --> 55:16.445
Stand by for stage one
and EPOS separation.

55:16.447 --> 55:20.582
ESS is disabled and we have
stage one separation.

55:20.584 --> 55:23.952
Payload separation
in three, two, one.

55:23.954 --> 55:25.754
Eject.

55:25.756 --> 55:28.724
Alignment and trajectory
is looking good.

55:28.726 --> 55:32.428
We still have good, strong
telemetry in the RCC.

55:56.654 --> 55:58.687
Standing by
for human 2.0 connection

55:58.689 --> 56:01.623
in three, two, one.

56:01.625 --> 56:04.460
Jessica, we see
what you see, over.

56:04.462 --> 56:06.862
Please commence
on observation report.

56:06.864 --> 56:08.764
Pressure stable inside
the craft.

56:08.766 --> 56:10.432
It's all looking good.

56:10.434 --> 56:11.800
Jessica, you are a go.

56:11.802 --> 56:13.869
Engaging on board
trajectory system.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.137
We're getting closer.

56:15.139 --> 56:16.538
We're approaching the void.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.073
I can almost see it.

56:18.075 --> 56:20.409
It's almost within range.

56:28.752 --> 56:30.719
There it is, there's the void.

56:30.721 --> 56:33.489
Wow. It is beautiful.

56:39.529 --> 56:40.829
Be advised,

56:40.831 --> 56:43.399
we are no longer receiving
craft telepatry.

56:43.401 --> 56:46.135
As we get closer,
I can feel everything around me.

56:46.137 --> 56:47.669
It's starting to move too.

56:47.671 --> 56:49.738
Oh, the pressure's so strong.

56:49.740 --> 56:52.541
Pressure readings are fluctuating.
It's becoming irregular.

56:52.543 --> 56:55.844
There's a strange light coming
in from all around, up ahead.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.780
Oh, wow, this is incredible.

56:57.782 --> 57:02.117
Especially since the void is
starting to distort everything.

57:02.119 --> 57:03.886
Here we go!

57:13.430 --> 57:17.032
We are losing your transmission.

57:27.210 --> 57:28.777
If you can still hear us,

57:28.779 --> 57:31.747
good luck and godspeed, Jessica.

57:31.749 --> 57:33.882
Well, we don't know, uh,

57:33.884 --> 57:37.686
exactly when we can expect
our astronauts to return.

57:37.688 --> 57:41.123
Um, we can only
speculate and hope,

57:41.125 --> 57:44.526
and I hope that they will be
back, you know, within the year,

57:44.528 --> 57:48.664
but it's possible that it could
take several years,

57:48.666 --> 57:50.899
several decades even.

57:50.901 --> 57:55.237
And there is also the remote
possibility that we...

57:55.239 --> 57:57.639
May never hear from them.

57:57.641 --> 58:00.909
Uh, we're prepared for
every eventuality.

58:00.911 --> 58:02.845
We're tracking them right now.

58:02.847 --> 58:04.780
And, um, well, as you can see,

58:04.782 --> 58:07.182
we're all working flat out,

58:07.184 --> 58:09.485
keeping tabs on what's going on.

58:09.487 --> 58:10.886
And everybody is listening,

58:10.888 --> 58:12.554
every single second.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.603
There's been an accident.

58:27.605 --> 58:29.771
And...

58:29.773 --> 58:35.010
I'm afraid that Jessica
has been involved.

58:35.012 --> 58:38.614
There was, um, an explosion...

58:38.616 --> 58:42.017
On the rocket and...

58:42.019 --> 58:43.852
I'm really sorry to say, but...

58:46.556 --> 58:47.789
We've lost her.

58:51.127 --> 58:53.562
Everything that's dangerous,
must be...

58:53.564 --> 58:54.963
And why was she on it?

58:54.965 --> 58:59.167
It's her job.

58:59.169 --> 59:02.671
Couldn't they have put
someone else on the rocket?

59:02.673 --> 59:03.839
No, darling.

59:06.576 --> 59:08.610
No.

59:08.612 --> 59:11.046
Yeah, that was tough,
my goodness.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.148
Uh...

59:13.150 --> 59:16.318
Oh, it's all very complicated

59:16.320 --> 59:20.222
I've never lied to my daughter
about anything before.

59:20.224 --> 59:23.792
And, um, of course, the last time
I had to tell her somebody died,

59:23.794 --> 59:25.727
it was my husband.

59:25.729 --> 59:29.798
Um, and it's not pleasant to
have to go through that again.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.868
I knew that, um...

59:32.870 --> 59:35.203
Well, if she could know
the truth and if she knew why

59:35.205 --> 59:36.572
she would forgive me.

59:38.775 --> 59:39.975
That's hard.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:04.333
This morning, one of our defense
ballistic missile radar systems

01:00:04.335 --> 01:00:07.002
picked up a...
A fast-moving object

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:08.337
heading towards
the Atlantic ocean.

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:10.839
We use this to
track space debris,

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:13.208
uh, satellites.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:16.044
This object, it has
the same size, velocity,

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:19.681
trajectory as the craft that
we sent through to the void.

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:22.284
I mean, we were awe struck,
that's for sure.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.019
I mean...

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:27.255
Within a few days
of launching, um...

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:29.658
To return so quickly...

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:38.734
Well, when we arrived, we lifted
the craft out of the water

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:42.170
and I remember smearing black
residue off the side.

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:44.773
Well, usually, when you see a
craft with that amount of aging,

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:47.342
you would expect that the craft had
been out for a long period of time

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:52.014
and had a very forcible entry
back into the atmosphere.

01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:53.815
From my experience
from previous missions,

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.751
what would happen is that
you would enter the craft

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:57.753
and there'd be
two astronauts there.

01:00:57.755 --> 01:01:00.295
But in this case, the military
astronaut was nowhere to be found.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:04.059
We need to consider
the fact that perhaps

01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:07.729
that this whole void...

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.732
Is a Trojan horse.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:11.900
That...

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:18.240
That this could be perhaps
a message, a warning.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:20.208
I don't think it's a failure

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.843
that it's come back
in seven days.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:23.979
I mean, we have something

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:27.783
that has been through the void
and come back.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.919
Now our next step
is to start doing tests.

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:33.789
As standard protocol
for all our astronauts,

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:35.323
we have to keep miss Johnson
in quarantine

01:01:35.325 --> 01:01:37.793
to prevent any form of
biological contamination

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:40.429
she may have been exposed to.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:42.764
We have to prepare ourselves
for the fact that

01:01:42.766 --> 01:01:44.132
the mission is a failure.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.970
What we need to do now is
get ready for next steps.

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:54.910
To be honest, whether she wakes
up is another thing.

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:57.412
She may physically wake up now,

01:01:57.414 --> 01:02:01.016
or even next week, or next year.

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:03.452
When a patient has suffered
severe brain damage,

01:02:03.454 --> 01:02:09.057
then... they go into a coma
or vegetative state.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:12.160
It's possible that
the sustained injury

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:15.764
is impairing their normal
brain function.

01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:18.233
When we plugged her
into the transcode bay,

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:21.870
we discovered that the recorded
data in her brain

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:25.907
showed several years-worth
of new memories recorded.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:29.077
Yet she had only
been away for five days.

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:36.084
It's possible, even probable,

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.320
that the time on the void

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:42.224
is well different
from our concept of time.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:45.260
What is a couple of years
the other side

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.896
may well just be
a few days here.

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:55.370
The transcode process works by

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:59.074
tapping into the connector
where the memories are stored.

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:02.344
This is made possible by artificial
intelligent chip implants

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.312
that's stored
at the side of the brain.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.882
So this helps us encode memories

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:10.452
and also stores them
as synaptic connections.

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:12.487
What our transcode
technology does

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:15.190
is it unscrambles this chain
of synaptic connections

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:17.459
into a stream of data.

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:21.163
Our software then processes
this stream of data as imagery.

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.799
So when played back,
it's.. It's incredible.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.901
It's actual memory footage.

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:48.256
We've transcoded
bursts of memory.

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:50.091
And, although short,
it's very promising,

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:52.828
in fact, it's... I think it's
better than anybody expected.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.896
Um, at this stage
of the game, however,

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:59.167
it... they are short because
it's very, uh, taxing mentally

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.902
for Jessica.

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:03.004
So she needs
a certain amount of time

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.106
to recover for the synapses
in her brain

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:07.309
to recover from the experience
that she's had

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:09.277
to, sort of,
re-gather, as it were,

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:11.513
um, and then we start again.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:14.182
So, for me,
there's a priority, obviously,

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.284
which is to
take care of Jessica.

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.186
I certainly don't want
the information that she has

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.055
to be compromised in any way

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:22.624
by pushing this process
too quickly.

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:25.761
However, there is an imperative that we
get the information as soon as possible.

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:32.300
We have some very worried people
here at strategic defense committee.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:34.269
With the heightened
activity in our skies,

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:37.105
national security alert
was elevated to code red.

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:39.641
Now bear in mind, we have
protocols set in place

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:41.276
for this kind of event.

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:42.377
Since the '40s.

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:25.113
Something must've triggered
her brain synapse like a switch.

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:28.350
Her brain activity
lit up like fireworks.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.720
Her diagnostics were normal.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:33.355
Nothing seemed damaged.

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:36.224
Well, her brain did
have a level of trauma,

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.059
but that's to be expected,

01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:42.130
and her memories will
take a while to reconnect.

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:47.235
Despite my professional advice
to the space agency officials,

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:50.038
not enough time was given
to allow for her recovery.

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:55.477
There were too many questions.

01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:57.312
And everyone wanted answers.

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:04.019
Jessica, I'm gonna
ask you some questions

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.021
and it's very important

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:09.190
that you answer them
as clearly as possible

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:13.128
so that we can prevent confusion
with the memory transcodes.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.229
I understand.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:21.536
What do you remember
from the launch?

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.304
It was so much light.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:25.673
I remember thinking
to myself that

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:29.477
this light is going to blind me
if I keep my eyes open.

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:33.148
Can you tell me what happened
with the soldier 2.0?

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:38.253
The solider... he remained quiet
as we went into the void.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:40.555
But as the light flashes
became more violent,

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:44.492
I... I couldn't watch him, I had
to close my eyes for a moment.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.132
And when I opened my eyes,
I noticed

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:53.635
that he was no longer
in the craft.

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:57.338
I looked outside and I could
see him floating away.

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:10.151
Jessica, sorry,
can you confirm that again?

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:14.422
I said, there was no way that he
could've left the craft via the hatch.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:20.328
He just floated there
as if frozen.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.332
He had a look of fear
in his eyes

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:28.569
and he kept looking down
at his arm.

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:32.774
His arm exploded into
a white flash of light,

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:36.678
which looked like
a nuclear bomb detonation.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.314
And then the craft began
spinning out of the void

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:43.184
and towards what
looked like a planet.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:51.459
I must've passed out because
I then found myself

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:55.662
on the planet's surface and
had no idea how that happened.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:59.167
I kept walking and walking.

01:08:59.169 --> 01:09:03.438
It was as if I was drawn to
a specific location.

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.600
Jessica,

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.735
did you make first contact?

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:09.337
Yes.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:10.972
I saw them.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:14.709
But they had no shape or form.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:18.913
I felt their presence as if they
were trying to communicate with me.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:23.885
And there was a flash,

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.421
and I found myself inside
a white environment.

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:33.494
In the distance...

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:36.331
Was something approaching me.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:38.866
I felt paralyzed.

01:10:38.868 --> 01:10:40.602
I-I just couldn't move.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.712
I know I should've been
scared or terrified

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.347
but I wasn't.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:56.017
I actually felt calm.

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.863
It was Jim Marcell.

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:13.368
But he didn't physically speak.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:15.470
I could hear him,
though, in my head,

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:18.906
telling me that everything
is going to be okay.

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:20.341
What are their intentions?

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.649
He kept saying
it's going to be okay

01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:29.550
and that our time has come.

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:34.622
It was strange,
I could feel what it was saying.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.859
It-it...
it wasn't a voice as such.

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:41.562
It was just information being
presented into my mind.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.468
Many in the committee
are questioning

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.671
the validity of
Jessica's memory transcodes,

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:52.807
in particular, the appearance
of astronaut Jim Marcell.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:56.544
Um, they are questioning whether this
is a manifestation of her imagination

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:59.013
or a kind of mirage,
if you will.

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:04.519
However, I have to wonder why
he appeared in the first place.

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:06.788
And, to me, I think
it's important to, perhaps,

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:10.024
examine the idea that
astronaut Jim Marcell

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:12.360
is alive and well,

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.761
and on the other side
of the void.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:16.698
He's not damaged in body
or mind, seemingly.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.401
So perhaps this would indicate
that their intentions towards us

01:12:20.403 --> 01:12:24.439
are positive and that
they mean us no harm.

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:26.407
We have to be extremely cautious

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:30.445
in our response
to Jessica's statements.

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:33.448
We have to run...
A whole lot of tests

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:35.049
to ascertain whether
or not she's suffering

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:37.752
from any form of
post-traumatic stress.

01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:40.455
She's been through one
hell of an experience.

01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:42.357
It's bound to have
some side effects,

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:45.860
even if they are temporary.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:48.363
We have a lot at stake here.

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:51.866
And we can't afford to make any
rash conclusions at this stage

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:55.770
about what the transcodes are
and where they come from.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:02.610
Are they really Jessica's
own organic memories?

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:03.945
Or are they imposed,
placed there,

01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:06.681
by someone or something else?

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:59.260
This is ISS, be advised
of incoming debris.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.562
The blowback does not look good.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.865
Multiple collisions with our
outer-orbit satellites

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:06.133
and the debris speed is
accelerating rapidly.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:11.172
It's heading right at us.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.674
Standing by for collision
avoidance maneuver.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:16.811
100 meters and closing.

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:20.181
75 meters and closing.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.550
50 meters and closing.

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:27.154
25 meters and closing.

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.869
Ten meters and closing.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.138
Five meters and closing.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.640
Three meters.

01:15:45.642 --> 01:15:46.974
Brace for impact.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.116
We were so wrong.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:07.955
We could not have been
more wrong about...

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.991
All of this.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:18.065
We were so blinded
by our own paranoia

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:20.034
that we couldn't see
what was really going on.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.839
We thought that
we were being attacked.

01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:27.775
It didn't occur to us
in our wildest dreams

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:30.277
that actually
we were being saved.

01:17:30.279 --> 01:17:33.948
That thought
never crossed my mind.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:35.983
And I am feeling...

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:38.853
Uh, humbled I think
is the word that comes to mind.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:42.790
And... um, you know,
you see something,

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:46.661
I guess you can't help but
question everything that you...

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:48.362
You think you know.

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:51.132
Breaking news, today,
not matter which race,

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.734
religion or political view
you hold,

01:17:53.736 --> 01:17:56.237
or wars which you are fighting,

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:58.105
everyone on this planet
is witnessing

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.041
a historical event,

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:04.011
which experts are calling the
cosmic event of our lifetime.

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:08.916
Since the event, Jessica's mind
is less constricted

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:11.852
and more memories
have been transcoded.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.988
The more we've transcoded,
the more we've learned about

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:17.191
Jessica's first
contact experience with them

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:20.227
and their intentions.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.201
He said that this
is all part of the cycle.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:30.471
A process created by them
to keep the universe stable

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:33.474
and working.

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:37.044
I had to ask, "why us?

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.746
Why did they save us?"

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.024
Whatever they
learned about us...

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:52.827
Perhaps made them decide

01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:56.430
that we were a species
worth preserving after all.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:59.767
Regardless of our flaws.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.371
He said their work is done

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.507
and, in time, they will return.

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:17.318
I never thought that
the gad would've played

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.821
such an important part
in saving humanity.

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:25.493
We designed it to inform
extraterrestrial intelligent life

01:19:25.495 --> 01:19:27.928
if they bothered reading it.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.297
Uh...

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:33.968
It happened, they did.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:38.472
Human beings,
when faced with the unknown,

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:43.544
there's an immediate reaction
to go on the offense.

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:45.346
You have two choices really:

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:47.014
Fight or flight.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:48.549
That was our mindset.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:50.885
Of course,
having the military involved,

01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:53.988
that's going to be part of how
we approach these things.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:56.423
And I think from early days,
you know,

01:19:56.425 --> 01:19:58.926
since the beginning
of this discovery,

01:19:58.928 --> 01:20:04.131
we gradually entered
onto that path

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:08.369
of feeling that
we were under threat.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:11.038
And I have to say it never
really crossed our minds

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.008
for one single second

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:18.913
that there was something out
there that was helping us.

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:22.183
Now, I don't know why that
didn't occur to us,

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:25.953
but maybe it's a question
we need to ask ourselves.

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:29.290
Is everything
that we don't understand,

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:32.459
is it something to be feared
right off the bat

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:34.428
as a knee-jerk reaction,

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:38.065
or is there space that we can
make to contemplate

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:39.867
that there could be
forces out there

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:42.169
that really are on our side,

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:45.372
and that are part of
helping us evolve?

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.245
Nothing...

01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:56.350
We thought we knew
about physics, science...

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.953
About intelligent life,

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:02.389
nothing that we've theorized

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:06.227
could ever have
prepared us for this.

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:08.295
There's no physical,

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.865
scientific explanation for this

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:13.868
or why it happened.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:17.304
Although the scientists and other
members of the space agency

01:21:17.306 --> 01:21:19.506
are overwhelmed by this event,

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:21.876
the defense department can't
help but ask the question

01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:24.211
about these aliens.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.444
Is it in their best interest...

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:28.949
If the human race survives?

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:32.253
Every astronaut is fitted
with a tracking device.

01:21:32.255 --> 01:21:33.954
So, in the early hours
of this morning,

01:21:33.956 --> 01:21:36.290
the military honed in
on a tracking signal

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:38.893
that was consistent
with the device

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:40.194
carried by astronaut
Jim Marcell.

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:43.631
They found him wandering around

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:47.468
in a state of complete shock
in the Arizona desert.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:51.005
And, um, we have no idea
how he got there.

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.345
I think maybe
we can assume that,

01:21:58.347 --> 01:22:00.381
now that the void
has disappeared,

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:03.951
his role as a conduit
is no longer necessary.

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:07.955
Unfortunately, um, Jim Marcell
has no recollection

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:10.124
of what happened to him
on the other side of the void.

01:22:10.126 --> 01:22:13.594
And he will need some time to
come to terms with recent events.

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:18.065
We really have no idea

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:20.534
what he experienced on
the other side of the void.

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.151
Since the disappearance
of the void

01:22:37.153 --> 01:22:40.421
and the black spheres, we've
been noticing a lot of strange

01:22:40.423 --> 01:22:43.958
and fascinating activity
above our planet.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.659
An aftermath of recent events.

01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:50.364
This swirling cloud of gas,
and dust and ice

01:22:50.366 --> 01:22:54.702
could be seen producing
what appeared to be planets

01:22:54.704 --> 01:22:58.138
and their moons being pulled
down into their own gravity.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:05.679
It's now looking like
we have a new solar system.

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:08.282
The fact that
it's actually happened,

01:23:08.284 --> 01:23:10.551
unsettling on, sort of,
the deepest level

01:23:10.553 --> 01:23:14.388
because it throws into question
every single thing

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:19.660
that I and my colleagues
have learned about our earth,

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:25.399
our solar system,
space and beyond.

01:23:25.401 --> 01:23:30.337
What resulted was the formation
of a new planet...

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.673
Right next to ours.

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:37.077
Like a sister planet
directly in our orbit.

01:23:37.079 --> 01:23:41.548
Our unmanned probes performed
atmosphere and surface scans.

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:45.719
And the resulting data indicated
that this new planet

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:50.357
has all of the ingredients
required to sustain human life.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:54.061
From surface temperature,
to magnetic field,

01:23:54.063 --> 01:23:56.130
water, oxygen.

01:23:56.132 --> 01:24:00.434
It was as though this planet
was custom-built just for us.

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:03.437
This new planet and its mass,

01:24:03.439 --> 01:24:06.040
it's almost identical
to our planet.

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:08.742
With a 10% variation in size.

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:12.613
That's why we're starting to
refer to it as "earth two."

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:21.388
Future world populations
predicted to soar

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:27.327
above 12 billion
and resources are running out,

01:24:27.329 --> 01:24:31.498
it's impossible to
accurately determine

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.701
how long we'll actually
sustain life here.

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:37.371
So when a mission
like this comes along,

01:24:37.373 --> 01:24:45.245
leaders of the world's nations
will pay any cost to be part of this.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:47.414
The arrival of earth two
has set off

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:52.252
what can only be described
as a 21st century gold rush.

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:53.787
Corporations
and governments alike

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:55.589
are quickly
positioning themselves,

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:57.291
and their country's interests,

01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:59.093
for our new neighboring planet.

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:01.862
The U.N. Has called upon
all leaders from key nations

01:25:01.864 --> 01:25:05.566
to come together to discuss
interplanetary strategies,

01:25:05.568 --> 01:25:07.768
which include the use
of nuclear power

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:09.837
to assist in colonization.

01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:11.638
Meanwhile,
people all over the world

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.842
are taking to social media
to express their hopes,

01:25:14.844 --> 01:25:17.311
thoughts and concerns.

01:25:17.313 --> 01:25:20.747
Earth two is a chance
to build a new life.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:23.851
What I'd like to know is
who is making those decisions?

01:25:23.853 --> 01:25:25.719
Rich and politicians,
they can't be the one

01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:28.689
to make this decision about
our children's future hope.

01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:31.225
I mean, what if there is
life on the new earth?

01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:32.826
I mean, what are we gonna see?

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:35.462
What are we gonna find
when we get up there?

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:37.364
We're gonna absolutely
destroy that planet.

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:38.665
Because the governments
are corrupt.

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:40.300
We should go to earth two
because that way

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.169
they can stay here
and they can continue to fight.

01:25:42.171 --> 01:25:43.337
I don't buy it.

01:25:43.339 --> 01:25:45.706
I think this is
a mining operation

01:25:45.708 --> 01:25:47.441
for minerals and resources.

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:49.376
This discovery changed

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:51.879
everything we know
about the universe

01:25:51.881 --> 01:25:53.647
and about ourselves.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.782
Not like democracy
exists anyway, right?

01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:58.385
But we should vote on the kind of
people that we want to send there.

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:00.487
The very best scientists,
the very best artists,

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:02.189
the very best philosophers,

01:26:02.191 --> 01:26:05.459
and people that actually
think and care about humanity.

01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:08.629
Well, this occurrence has
opened up the Pandora's box

01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:11.231
of whys.

01:26:11.233 --> 01:26:13.834
There's also a whole host
of-of...

01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:16.703
Other complicated questions.

01:26:16.705 --> 01:26:21.341
Specifically, how do we proceed?

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:32.286
It's been 12 months
since we last saw the void.

01:26:32.288 --> 01:26:34.454
Yet I have this sure feeling,

01:26:34.456 --> 01:26:36.890
they haven't really left us.

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:38.258
And, if anything,

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:39.560
they're still observing us.

01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:45.499
Today, we are sending
the first manned spacecrafts

01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:46.833
to earth two.

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:55.542
The space agency decided that
we send only human 2.0s first

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:58.612
with the intention of
running tests on earth two

01:26:58.614 --> 01:27:00.347
in order to lay down
the foundations

01:27:00.349 --> 01:27:02.282
for when the time is right

01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:05.352
to commence sending humans
to settle down

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:09.957
and colonize for
future generations.

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:35.549
But one does wonder whether
we will make the same mistakes

01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:37.651
we've been making for centuries.

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.461
How can we ensure this new home

01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:48.929
brings out the best in us?

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:55.335
Or how we, and our
future generations,

01:27:55.337 --> 01:27:58.405
don't make the same mistakes
we did in our past,

01:27:58.407 --> 01:28:02.309
and prove that our existence
was worth saving.

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.949
We were so obsessed
with discovering new life

01:28:08.951 --> 01:28:11.285
when, on reflection,

01:28:11.287 --> 01:28:14.588
we have still yet
to discover ourselves.

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:24.364
We now have another chance
to do just that.
