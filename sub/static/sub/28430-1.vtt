"...said the Good Witch
of the North.

03:11.541 --> 03:14.877
So Dorothy closed her eyes
and tapped the heels together

03:14.879 --> 03:17.847
of her ruby red slippers
three times.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.782
'There is no place like home,

03:19.784 --> 03:22.051
there is no place like home,

03:22.053 --> 03:24.887
there is no place like home.'

03:24.889 --> 03:27.455
And with a twist of her wand,

03:27.457 --> 03:29.992
Dorothy was back home safe

03:29.994 --> 03:33.361
in her bed
with all her stuffed animals."

03:33.363 --> 03:35.530
That's not what it says.

03:36.901 --> 03:38.634
It's time for bed, Goose.

03:38.636 --> 03:41.570
Will you read
Edgar Allen Poe tomorrow?

03:41.572 --> 03:43.806
Only if your mommy
says it's okay.

03:43.808 --> 03:46.108
She's gonna say no.

03:46.110 --> 03:48.577
"Well, touch luck,"
said the woodchuck.

03:48.579 --> 03:52.547
I don't say that to you
every time Mommy tells you no.

03:52.549 --> 03:54.417
Mommy does say no a lot,
doesn't she?

03:56.053 --> 03:57.352
Hm.

03:57.354 --> 03:59.688
Can I have
a cool nickname like you?

03:59.690 --> 04:02.591
What are you talking about?
You got lots of cool nicknames.

04:02.593 --> 04:03.893
You got some
of the coolest nicknames

04:03.895 --> 04:04.762

Angel Blue Eyes.

04:15.773 --> 04:17.774
Total lame-o.

04:19.476 --> 04:23.012
I want something more like...

04:23.014 --> 04:24.013
Wolfgirl,

04:24.015 --> 04:26.481
the most awesomest superhero
in the village.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.085
Wolfgirl.

04:30.087 --> 04:31.856
You are so silly.

04:35.626 --> 04:39.427
Mommy says she misses
your handsome face.

04:39.429 --> 04:40.497
Mommy says that?

04:44.001 --> 04:47.736
Can I ask you
a personal question?

04:47.738 --> 04:49.171
Uh-huh.

04:49.173 --> 04:51.676
What's a dirty Mexican?

04:52.910 --> 04:54.542
Where did you hear that?

04:54.544 --> 04:55.678
School.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.782
- Who?
- Kingston.

04:58.916 --> 05:00.983
What did Kingston say?

05:00.985 --> 05:03.621
That I was a dirty Mexican.

05:06.423 --> 05:08.092
Well, your mom is a Mexican.

05:11.629 --> 05:13.898
Oh, we got some dirt
on your cheek there.

05:15.432 --> 05:16.968
So, yep. You're a dirty Mexican.

05:18.468 --> 05:20.470
But now you're a clean Mexican.

05:22.773 --> 05:25.875
- I love you daddy.
- I love you, too.

05:25.877 --> 05:27.377
Eskimos.

05:31.015 --> 05:32.449
Daddy...

05:33.618 --> 05:35.483
I don't ever want you to go away

05:35.485 --> 05:38.055
and never come back home
to me and mommy.

05:39.857 --> 05:41.092
I won't.

05:43.460 --> 05:44.762
Here.

05:48.132 --> 05:53.569
This is a magic dragon.

05:53.571 --> 05:54.772
It will keep you safe.

05:58.843 --> 06:01.644
- All right?
- Thank you, Daddy.

06:14.191 --> 06:16.725
All right, Speedy Gonzales.

06:17.595 --> 06:18.260
Brush.

06:20.765 --> 06:23.732
I brush my teeth
for a second time

06:23.734 --> 06:25.668
to keep myself
from falling asleep.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.638
- I'm brushing.
- Uh-huh.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.873
Is there any word on if you're
heading out this week?

06:30.875 --> 06:31.840
I don't know.

06:35.947 --> 06:38.280
Hey, you know
what Olivia asked me?

06:38.282 --> 06:40.584
- Hm?
- What is a dirty Mexican.

06:43.587 --> 06:45.821
Kingston.

06:45.823 --> 06:49.093
Can't we wait to have
this conversation until after?

06:51.162 --> 06:54.196
I think I have some
unfinished business with you.

06:54.198 --> 06:56.533
- Hm.
- Uh-huh.

06:58.002 --> 07:00.903
That's affirmative, Lieutenant.

07:00.905 --> 07:02.606
I like that.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.643
Did you close Olivia's door?

07:09.280 --> 07:10.980
No.

07:10.982 --> 07:12.314
Can't we just keep it open?

07:12.316 --> 07:15.250
All right.

07:15.252 --> 07:16.685
- All right, I'll be right back.
- Go.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.589
- Yeah, one second.
- Mm.

08:36.332 --> 08:37.333
Ah...

08:39.870 --> 08:42.239
Put your tongue outside so I can
check you out a little bit.

08:52.683 --> 08:54.116
<i>Starship,
this is Wolfman.</i>

08:54.118 --> 08:55.150
<i>I am in position.</i>

08:55.152 --> 08:57.086
<i>I have located the package</i>

08:57.088 --> 08:59.755
<i>and got eyes
on all landmarks down range.</i>

08:59.757 --> 09:01.959
This is Starship.
Copy that, Wolfman.

09:03.727 --> 09:05.127
What is your season?

09:05.129 --> 09:08.764
I have four seasons.
One is our Alpha.

09:08.766 --> 09:11.366
Package is being moved.
I am ready for first contact.

09:11.368 --> 09:12.603
Stand by.

09:13.904 --> 09:15.372
Red's are almost in position.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.309
How about two Mikes out.

09:19.677 --> 09:22.012
Keep your booger finger
on that hook.

09:22.913 --> 09:24.379
Wait till go.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.869
Scorpion, you got five Gremlins
coming up on your six.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.404
Let's keep this quiet.

10:55.406 --> 10:56.840
Stand by.

11:30.908 --> 11:33.308
Red's one and two have landed.

11:33.310 --> 11:35.045
Ready to pop that cherry.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.391
Jose?

11:58.302 --> 12:00.337
Joseph!

12:29.066 --> 12:31.368
Starship, bogies four
and five are eliminated.

12:39.209 --> 12:40.511
Sergio?

12:54.992 --> 12:56.327
Chino?

12:57.494 --> 12:58.395
Chino?

12:59.330 --> 13:00.964
Chino?

13:02.399 --> 13:03.834
Chino?

13:05.903 --> 13:07.237
Chino?

13:20.417 --> 13:23.218
Scorpion, your nine o'clock.

13:29.159 --> 13:30.992
<i>Shit.</i>

13:30.994 --> 13:32.427
<i>Starship, they have body cams.</i>

13:32.429 --> 13:34.298
We are compromised.

13:46.578 --> 13:48.176
Scorpion, get the fuck back.

13:48.178 --> 13:49.511
Starship, we are compromised.

13:49.513 --> 13:51.581
I repeat, we are compromised.

14:22.647 --> 14:24.647
Buckeye, this is Starship.
Copy that?

14:24.649 --> 14:26.515
Wolfman, pull out. Everyone,
fall back to rendezvous.

14:28.185 --> 14:29.286
Starship, come in.

14:32.022 --> 14:35.424
Heat Wave calling for extraction
and immediate air support.

15:16.768 --> 15:19.201
Starship, we need
an immediate evacuation.

15:19.203 --> 15:20.736
Come on!

15:32.650 --> 15:34.251
Wolfman is going for package.

16:17.795 --> 16:20.663
Ryan, I'm
with the United States Navy.

16:20.665 --> 16:22.700
I'm here to take you back
to your mommy and daddy.

17:16.887 --> 17:19.154
Go, go.

17:19.156 --> 17:20.387
Hey. Hey, Rusty.

17:20.390 --> 17:21.824
- I need to...
- Baby, baby, baby, wake up.

17:21.826 --> 17:24.794
- Back. Run!
- Listen to me, okay?

17:24.796 --> 17:25.962
Honey,
you're just having a dream.

17:25.964 --> 17:28.898
All right? Listen to my voice.
It's me. It's your wife.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.298
Baby. Lieutenant!

17:30.300 --> 17:32.269
At ease, sailor!

17:38.943 --> 17:41.509
Where are we?

17:43.581 --> 17:45.781
You're at home now.

17:45.783 --> 17:47.583
With me.

17:47.585 --> 17:49.752
Vanessa.

17:49.754 --> 17:51.321
I know who you are.

17:53.423 --> 17:56.592
You were just
having a nightmare, baby.

17:56.594 --> 17:58.128
Where were you?

17:59.229 --> 18:00.565
In the jungle.

18:01.699 --> 18:03.568
And who were your teammates?

18:04.802 --> 18:06.602
Uh...

18:06.604 --> 18:08.372
Scorpion.

18:10.808 --> 18:12.842
Lucas?

18:12.844 --> 18:14.311
Lucas is fine.

18:18.382 --> 18:19.684
Who else was there?

18:22.386 --> 18:24.219
Starship.

18:24.221 --> 18:25.821
Uh...

18:25.823 --> 18:27.157
Buckeye.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.764
Starship and Buckeye
are not real.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.765
Who else was in your dream?

18:35.767 --> 18:37.200
Skid Row.

18:38.402 --> 18:39.403
Nope.

18:40.404 --> 18:41.906
They're not real. None of them.

18:43.340 --> 18:45.208
I know them so well.

18:46.711 --> 18:49.377
Only in your head.

18:49.379 --> 18:53.250
Rusty, you're just
having some war trauma.

19:00.490 --> 19:01.425
The white snake.

19:02.359 --> 19:03.793
White snake?

19:03.795 --> 19:06.862
So, you were in Nicaragua.

19:06.864 --> 19:08.666
Yeah.

19:09.701 --> 19:11.468
Yeah, Nicaragua.

19:13.604 --> 19:14.872
We were all there.

19:16.007 --> 19:17.274
We died.

19:18.275 --> 19:20.009
Lucas...

19:20.011 --> 19:22.377
No. Your mission was successful.

19:23.447 --> 19:25.948
Baby, baby, I need you
to breathe, okay?

19:25.950 --> 19:29.919
Listen to me. You all made it.

19:29.921 --> 19:32.722
Lieutenant Pope...

19:32.724 --> 19:34.522
and Little Mann,

19:34.524 --> 19:36.357
Rooster,

19:36.359 --> 19:37.993
Casper, Sunny.

19:37.995 --> 19:40.528
Lucas called you yesterday.

19:40.530 --> 19:43.400
I mean, baby,
look at your phone.

19:45.870 --> 19:47.605
Is Daddy okay?

19:48.940 --> 19:49.839
Yes, sweetie.

19:49.841 --> 19:51.841
Daddy was just
having a nightmare, okay?

19:51.843 --> 19:53.976
Go back to bed.
I'll be there in a second.

19:53.978 --> 19:55.345
Okay.

19:56.914 --> 19:58.683
I love you, Daddy.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.527
Check your messages.

20:25.777 --> 20:26.876
<i>Wolfy!</i>

20:26.878 --> 20:30.512
<i>Hey, Rust, sorry I forgot
to call you yesterday.</i>

20:30.514 --> 20:32.514
<i>Me and baby girl
took the boat out sailing</i>

20:32.516 --> 20:34.116
<i>and we just ended up
hanging out at sea</i>

20:34.118 --> 20:35.684
<i>and I couldn't get back
with you.</i>

20:35.686 --> 20:36.986
<i>No cell service, dude.</i>

20:36.988 --> 20:39.454
<i>But if you're free later today,
hey, let's grab a quick beer,</i>

20:39.456 --> 20:42.057
<i>or we'll roll
together at the twins' party.</i>

20:42.059 --> 20:44.059
<i>Love to Vanessa
and Little Blue Eyes, man.</i>

20:44.061 --> 20:45.830
<i>Slayers out!</i>

20:47.665 --> 20:48.966
See?

20:50.601 --> 20:52.003
I need to call him.

21:10.822 --> 21:12.721
<i>Rust?</i>

21:12.723 --> 21:14.025
Lucas.

21:16.127 --> 21:17.325
<i>Rusty!</i>

21:17.327 --> 21:20.461
- Hey, man, how are you doing?
- <i>Dude...</i>

21:20.463 --> 21:22.898
<i>I'm doing all right, man.
I'm sleeping.</i>

21:22.900 --> 21:24.867
<i>How are you doing, bro?</i>

21:24.869 --> 21:26.569
I'm doing pretty good.

21:26.571 --> 21:27.736
I just wanted to know
if you're going

21:27.738 --> 21:29.439
to the twins' party tomorrow.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.142
<i>Yeah, man.
We'll definitely be there.</i>

21:33.144 --> 21:34.877
<i>Definitely.</i>

21:34.879 --> 21:37.512
- Cool, man.
- <i>Hey.</i>

21:37.514 --> 21:39.148
<i>You doing okay?</i>

Yeah, yeah. I just
wanted to check in on you, bud.

21:43.453 --> 21:45.754
<i>Got you.
All right. All right.</i>

21:45.756 --> 21:47.490
<i>Is Vanessa with you?</i>

21:48.659 --> 21:50.425
Uh-huh.

21:50.427 --> 21:53.095
<i>Hey, you got me
on speakerphone?</i>

21:53.097 --> 21:55.430
Uh-huh.

21:55.432 --> 21:58.667
- <i>Hey, Vanessa.</i>
- Hey, Lucas.

21:58.669 --> 22:02.537
<i>Hey, take care of
that old dog for us, all right?</i>

22:02.539 --> 22:04.039
Copy that.

22:04.041 --> 22:06.075
See you tomorrow, Lucas.

22:06.077 --> 22:07.810
<i>You got it.</i>

22:07.812 --> 22:09.680
<i>Hey, man. Bye, daddio.</i>

22:10.982 --> 22:13.983
See you, Lucas.
Talk to you later, man.

22:13.985 --> 22:16.185
<i>You got it, bro.</i>

22:16.187 --> 22:17.586
Bye.

22:17.588 --> 22:18.689
<i>Bye.</i>

22:23.961 --> 22:25.663
You all made it.

22:37.942 --> 22:41.110
What about the little girl

22:41.112 --> 22:42.512
with the blonde hair?

22:45.515 --> 22:47.450
I don't know who she is.

22:57.061 --> 22:59.695
Baby.

22:59.697 --> 23:01.230
Baby.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.867
Yeah.

23:04.869 --> 23:06.003
Come here.

23:12.910 --> 23:14.944
- I'm sorry.
- No, baby. Don't be sorry.

23:14.946 --> 23:15.878
I'm sorry.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.682
Don't be sorry.

23:23.254 --> 23:26.521
Shh!

23:26.523 --> 23:30.161
Baby, why don't you go
get some fresh air, okay?

23:31.896 --> 23:34.131
I'm gonna put Olivia to bed.

23:38.970 --> 23:41.670
Okay.

23:43.174 --> 23:46.275
Yeah.

23:46.277 --> 23:47.712
Okay.

24:14.005 --> 24:15.606
I hate you.

24:31.022 --> 24:32.321
Hey, kiddo.

24:32.323 --> 24:33.758
Hey.

24:37.995 --> 24:40.029
We got Pandy, huh?

24:40.031 --> 24:42.164
- Yeah.
- How's Pandy doing?

24:42.166 --> 24:43.801
He's doing good.

24:44.935 --> 24:47.603
Yeah? How are you doing, Pandy?

24:47.605 --> 24:50.741
"Oh, you know,
I just like to get tickled."

24:52.676 --> 24:56.078
- Do it. Tickle him.
- Tickle Pandy?

24:57.681 --> 24:59.850
Here you go. Tickle Pandy.

25:08.159 --> 25:09.992
I'll fix it.

25:09.994 --> 25:12.928
I don't think it's broken.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.165
It's down, huh?

25:19.170 --> 25:21.070
Nightmare?

25:21.072 --> 25:22.039
Yeah.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.608
How bad?

25:27.144 --> 25:28.012
A level 10.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.347
Monster in it?

25:34.251 --> 25:35.719
What color?

25:39.857 --> 25:40.758
Green.

25:43.761 --> 25:45.761
I'm sorry.

25:45.763 --> 25:48.897
You know what I do when I have a
nightmare with a monster in it?

25:48.899 --> 25:54.036
Hey, I told you
just a quick kiss and a hug.

25:54.038 --> 25:55.706
Get your butt back in bed.

25:59.243 --> 26:02.077
I'll see you, girl. I love you.

26:02.079 --> 26:04.012
I love you more.

26:04.014 --> 26:06.281
Hey, get some rest, right?

26:06.283 --> 26:07.151
Okay.

26:08.986 --> 26:11.253
Bye.

26:11.255 --> 26:13.055
Bye, Mom.

26:18.229 --> 26:19.396
Hey.

26:24.969 --> 26:27.671
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:30.841 --> 26:32.109
Let's go to bed.

26:35.713 --> 26:38.080
I'll be there in a minute.

26:38.082 --> 26:39.316
Okay.

27:10.781 --> 27:14.950
Daddy, will you please
say something for little Hammy?

27:14.952 --> 27:17.953
Uh, yeah, okay. Um...

27:17.955 --> 27:19.221
Dear...

27:19.223 --> 27:20.923
Dear Lord,

27:20.925 --> 27:22.357
thank you for giving us Hammy.

27:22.359 --> 27:24.493
It was quite a champion.

27:24.495 --> 27:26.931
Uh, lived a good life.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.400
Bless your soul, Hammy.

27:30.768 --> 27:32.267
Thank you. Amen.

27:32.269 --> 27:35.372
It's okay, Daddy. You can cry.

27:36.407 --> 27:38.941
Hm. Yeah.

27:38.943 --> 27:40.411
Sometimes adults cry.

27:41.345 --> 27:44.248
Is Heaven different
for everyone?

27:47.117 --> 27:49.186
Yeah, I think so.

27:50.788 --> 27:53.222
What about our souls?

27:53.224 --> 27:55.359
Do all souls go to Heaven?

27:56.327 --> 27:57.995
I believe so.

27:59.296 --> 28:03.801
Do you think sometimes souls get
lost between here and Heaven?

28:05.069 --> 28:09.538
I think sometimes
souls stay behind

28:09.540 --> 28:12.209
to watch over us
and make sure that we're okay.

28:13.244 --> 28:14.979
You're talking
about little Hammy?

28:16.547 --> 28:17.881
Papa?

28:21.318 --> 28:24.386
Olivia, I need you
to get in the car

28:24.388 --> 28:26.888
right now, young lady.

28:26.890 --> 28:29.057
Rusty, you didn't fix the light.

28:29.059 --> 28:33.028
Is Daddy in trouble?
He was with me and Hammy.

28:33.030 --> 28:34.496
He's going to be if you guys

28:34.498 --> 28:37.199
don't get your butts
in this car right now.

28:37.201 --> 28:39.036
Thank you, young lady.

28:42.539 --> 28:45.175
Lieutenant
James Rusty Wittenburg.

28:46.277 --> 28:47.409
The light.

28:47.411 --> 28:49.280
You have
until the count of three.

29:19.877 --> 29:21.943
I'm calling Eric.

29:21.945 --> 29:22.813
Excuse me.

29:23.881 --> 29:26.148
Oh, come on.

29:26.150 --> 29:28.150
He's a professional electrician.

29:28.152 --> 29:30.653
He's a professional
electrician that wants to...

29:30.655 --> 29:32.087
St...

29:32.089 --> 29:33.955
Yeah, Eric is an electrician

29:33.957 --> 29:35.326
that wants
to take Daddy's place.

29:37.595 --> 29:39.528
- High school sweetheart.
- Stop.

29:39.530 --> 29:41.430
He would love
to be back in the picture.

29:41.432 --> 29:42.964
That's ridiculous.

29:42.966 --> 29:45.967
Just give me one more week
and I'll fix it,

29:45.969 --> 29:47.469
honest to God.

29:47.471 --> 29:49.639
It's become
a personal thing for me.

29:52.209 --> 29:54.076
- One week.
- Hm.

29:54.078 --> 29:55.911
- One.
- One week.

29:55.913 --> 29:58.413
I'm giving you
until next Saturday,

29:58.415 --> 30:02.250
but if I see that light flicker
one more time,

30:02.252 --> 30:05.320
I don't care,
it doesn't have to be Eric

30:05.322 --> 30:07.590
but we need to hire
a professional electrician

30:07.592 --> 30:09.659
who knows how to handle
fixing a short.

30:09.661 --> 30:11.960
I can fix a short.

30:11.962 --> 30:12.894
One week.

30:12.896 --> 30:15.299
There's something wacky
with the wiring.

30:21.505 --> 30:22.940
I can do it.

30:26.110 --> 30:28.243
There's the wolf pack.

30:28.245 --> 30:29.978
Hi, Casper.

30:29.980 --> 30:31.413
Hey there, little buddy.

30:31.415 --> 30:33.515
- Hi.
- Where you been?

30:33.517 --> 30:36.184
At the grade,
working on science project.

30:36.186 --> 30:37.687
Uh-huh.

30:37.689 --> 30:40.422
Well, I'm just here
to drop off presents.

30:40.424 --> 30:43.093
Becky's BFF's getting married,
and she's a bridesmaid.

30:43.994 --> 30:45.327
I have no choice in the matter,

30:45.329 --> 30:48.163
so I'll be leading her on
from the sidelines.

30:48.165 --> 30:49.164
Well, you're a sweetheart.

30:49.166 --> 30:51.567
This one probably
would have left me hanging.

30:51.569 --> 30:53.368
Hey. We are up a home.

30:53.370 --> 30:54.238
Uh-huh.

30:56.306 --> 30:57.640
Hey, Little Slugger.

30:57.642 --> 30:59.274
Hi, Uncle Little Mann.

30:59.276 --> 31:00.676
Bye, Uncle Little Mann.

31:06.216 --> 31:07.149
Hm.

31:07.151 --> 31:09.019
I wonder which one of you
she takes after.

31:12.289 --> 31:13.221
Oh.

31:13.223 --> 31:14.624
Here, hold him. He's sleeping.

31:14.626 --> 31:16.659
What a face.

31:16.661 --> 31:19.662
He's 15 pounds already.
You ain't kidding.

31:19.664 --> 31:22.097
- They grow like a weed.
- Shh!

31:22.099 --> 31:23.699
Unfortunately, we're not gonna
be able to stay long.

31:23.701 --> 31:25.133
I'm sorry.

31:25.135 --> 31:27.436
Young wife's the boss.

31:27.438 --> 31:30.505
Hi baby, come here.

31:30.507 --> 31:32.507
I promised
I'd work in the kitchen.

31:32.509 --> 31:33.643
I think
she likes me.

31:33.645 --> 31:35.678
I think she does.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.680
Oh, my mother. I'm so sorry.

31:37.682 --> 31:41.617
Ah, Vanessa,
you look like a Spanish rose

31:41.619 --> 31:43.385
in bloom in Texas and...

31:43.387 --> 31:45.655
A baby!

31:45.657 --> 31:46.521
It's a baby.

31:46.523 --> 31:49.057
Oh, come on.
We gotta show everyone.

31:49.059 --> 31:50.325
Oh, look at you.

31:50.327 --> 31:52.662
- And you're wearing heels, too.
- I know, she's amazing, huh?

31:52.664 --> 31:57.265
How skinny you are already.
Oh, my God. That is unfair.

31:59.203 --> 32:02.037
- Hi, Uncle Rusty.
- Hi, girls.

32:02.039 --> 32:04.206
Say cheese
to our new spy cam recorder.

32:04.208 --> 32:08.343
Uh, happy birthday, Ash.
Happy birthday, Renee.

32:08.345 --> 32:09.679
Our dad got it for us.

32:09.681 --> 32:10.746
Right on.

32:10.748 --> 32:12.282
Say something cool.

32:14.284 --> 32:15.283
How's the party?

32:15.285 --> 32:16.786
That's lame.

32:16.788 --> 32:17.986
Show him.

32:17.988 --> 32:20.790
No. Did you know this thing
has, like, a million pixels

32:20.792 --> 32:23.091
and has a panoramic view?

32:23.093 --> 32:24.526
Right on.

32:24.528 --> 32:25.595
All right, we'll show you,

32:25.597 --> 32:29.500
but you've gotta promise
you don't tell our dad.

32:30.501 --> 32:32.100
Scout's honor.

32:32.102 --> 32:34.269
She filmed it.

32:35.205 --> 32:38.273
I'm gonna sell it
for distribution on line.

32:38.275 --> 32:39.675
It's Rooster.

32:39.677 --> 32:42.614
- Hey, you know what...
- You promised!

32:47.384 --> 32:49.384
Wolf, wolf, wolf.

32:49.386 --> 32:51.152
Wolfman.

32:51.154 --> 32:52.788
Slash. Look's good.

32:52.790 --> 32:54.790
- Hey, daddio.
- What's up, Jeff?

32:54.792 --> 32:56.424
Hey, can I talk to you
real quick?

32:56.426 --> 32:58.095
- Yeah.
- Cool.

33:04.167 --> 33:05.534
What's up?

33:05.536 --> 33:06.836
Hey.

33:06.838 --> 33:08.472
You solid from last night?

33:10.240 --> 33:12.140
Yep.

33:12.142 --> 33:14.276
Bad moment.

33:14.278 --> 33:16.313
How did I get it this time?
Head or chest?

33:18.282 --> 33:19.684
Both.

33:24.187 --> 33:25.623
You've been having
a lot of those lately.

33:34.298 --> 33:35.765
Hey.

33:35.767 --> 33:37.332
Remember that time
back in high school,

33:37.334 --> 33:39.200
that Jeffrey Hayden incident?

33:39.202 --> 33:40.703
Yeah, you're going way back.

33:40.705 --> 33:44.139
That boy. Pick-up game.
Two-hand touch football.

33:44.141 --> 33:45.908
He cheap shot at me,
and you walked over,

33:45.910 --> 33:47.542
you picked him up,

33:47.544 --> 33:50.646
you slammed him on that fence
and broke his arm.

33:50.648 --> 33:51.747
I did that?

33:51.749 --> 33:53.183
Yeah, you did.

33:54.351 --> 33:55.419
You had my back.

33:57.889 --> 34:00.223
You were gonna get suspended,
but who took the blame?

34:02.794 --> 34:04.161
You took the blame.

34:05.362 --> 34:06.698
Who's got your back?

34:09.498 --> 34:11.766
You've...

34:11.768 --> 34:13.536
You've got my back.

34:15.806 --> 34:17.842
Nothing has changed.

34:20.377 --> 34:23.213
I had your back then.
I've got your back now.

34:27.484 --> 34:29.252
I think you need
to see a professional.

34:45.837 --> 34:47.605
I'll make the call next week.

34:49.741 --> 34:51.408
You're my best friend, Rusty.

34:52.777 --> 34:54.846
One is none, two is one.

35:08.492 --> 35:09.491
Now go give LT some love

35:09.493 --> 35:11.663
before he overcooks
my steak for hogging you.

35:12.797 --> 35:14.398
Be right back.

35:25.677 --> 35:29.578
- You're such a flirt.
- Thank you.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.947
I'm not making it well done.
It is not American.

35:31.949 --> 35:34.449
Yeah, but I'm not gonna have
stuff running around the plate

35:34.451 --> 35:35.618
over there for people either.

35:35.620 --> 35:37.385
It's gonna taste like Cherokee.
It's going to be all...

35:37.387 --> 35:38.554
Hey.

35:38.556 --> 35:39.722
We're almost done with the food.

35:39.724 --> 35:42.257
Medium for you
and rare for Vanessa?

35:42.259 --> 35:43.458
Medium for Vanessa.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.761
Okay. And I know Olivia is
going through that picky state,

35:45.763 --> 35:46.796
so I got her some macaroni.

35:46.798 --> 35:48.329
Well, that sounds about right.

35:48.331 --> 35:50.365
I'm so glad you are here.

35:51.301 --> 35:52.968
Now, if you need anything,
you just holler.

35:52.970 --> 35:54.670
Momma! What?

35:55.505 --> 35:57.405
Girl's got
entirely too much energy.

35:58.442 --> 36:00.609
- How are you doing, bud?
- I'm doing okay, man.

36:00.611 --> 36:02.578
- Olivia is looking like her mom.
- Yeah.

36:02.580 --> 36:04.279
And the twins
are taking after their dad.

36:04.281 --> 36:07.415
Yeah, they're growing up
way too fast, brother.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.319
Darla wants another set.

36:11.321 --> 36:14.458
Hey, you know that
little recorder you got them?

36:15.893 --> 36:17.294
She's pregnant.

36:18.963 --> 36:20.629
- Darla?
- Of course Darla.

36:20.631 --> 36:22.565
Who the hell do you think
I'm talking about?

36:22.567 --> 36:24.466
And she's hoping
for another set.

36:24.468 --> 36:27.469
Ooh!
Well, that'll keep you young.

36:27.471 --> 36:28.704
Yeah, I sure hope so.

36:28.706 --> 36:31.040
- Anyone else know?
- No. Just you.

36:31.042 --> 36:33.909
We're gonna wait
till after the first trimester.

36:33.911 --> 36:36.645
After what happened last time...

36:36.647 --> 36:38.080
it didn't go over too well.

36:38.082 --> 36:39.782
Yeah, I get you, man.

36:39.784 --> 36:41.751
Well, uh...

36:41.753 --> 36:44.053
Here's to another set.

36:45.790 --> 36:47.257
Yeah.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.794
Go in there. Get some snacks.
Steak's almost ready.

36:51.796 --> 36:52.661
- Cool.
- Be right in.

36:52.663 --> 36:53.696
Got it.

36:53.698 --> 36:56.364
- It was exactly like that.
- No, I don't think so.

36:56.366 --> 36:58.533
Yes. Yes, it was.

36:58.535 --> 36:59.400
Believe me, I know.

36:59.402 --> 37:01.771
It was right
before we hit Costa Rica,

37:01.773 --> 37:04.472
and your dad
may have been toast and rosy,

37:04.474 --> 37:07.576
but that night after the brawl,
that's when he said it,

37:07.578 --> 37:09.477
and pardon my French,

37:09.479 --> 37:12.413
but the toughest son of a bitch
there ever was,

37:12.415 --> 37:13.785
even tougher than Top Dog.

37:15.019 --> 37:16.654
But he certainly said it.

37:20.057 --> 37:23.358
Hm. You guys keep
staring at us, huh?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.761
We got him.

37:25.763 --> 37:27.497
Looks like your boy
needs a bailout.

37:29.767 --> 37:31.567
My boy could handle himself.

37:35.673 --> 37:36.806
Wise man.

37:36.808 --> 37:38.841
I'm getting another.

37:38.843 --> 37:40.009
You want one, young lady?

37:40.011 --> 37:41.543
Dad, you've had enough, okay?

37:41.545 --> 37:43.612
- Um, I would love one.
- Got it.

37:43.614 --> 37:45.315
Your dad's a gentleman.

37:48.886 --> 37:51.053
I need you to stop that.

37:51.055 --> 37:52.723
It's my property, dick weed.

37:54.491 --> 37:55.791
I apologize.

37:55.793 --> 37:57.660
I'm married, as you can see.

37:57.662 --> 37:59.094
That thing don't mean shit.

37:59.096 --> 38:00.863
What the fuck are you doing
in a place like this?

38:00.865 --> 38:01.831
It does to me.

38:01.833 --> 38:04.166
To us it don't.

38:04.168 --> 38:05.435
You know, I...

38:07.939 --> 38:08.906
Uh-huh.

38:10.407 --> 38:11.441
Now you've done it.

38:15.146 --> 38:16.879
Do you know who I am?

38:16.881 --> 38:19.547
No, I've never seen you
in my life.

38:19.549 --> 38:21.584
I'm fucking Deacon.

38:21.586 --> 38:22.818
No, never heard of you.

38:25.156 --> 38:27.490
Funny. This is my pack.

38:32.997 --> 38:34.799
No trouble. We're leaving.

38:40.571 --> 38:42.571
Dad.

38:49.981 --> 38:51.749
Hey, pull out for a second.

38:54.719 --> 38:56.185
This is my boy.

38:56.187 --> 38:59.555
Hey, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

38:59.557 --> 39:01.891
He's a grade-A son of a bitch.

39:01.893 --> 39:04.492
Done three tours
for this country.

39:04.494 --> 39:06.061
That's the United States
of America,

39:06.063 --> 39:08.831
in case you shit-for-brains
don't realize it.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.199
We're all on the same side.

39:10.201 --> 39:11.967
And this is his brother.

39:11.969 --> 39:13.903
Same goes for this man.

39:13.905 --> 39:16.171
Blood runs thick in our family.

39:16.173 --> 39:18.173
And if you boys feel
like two-stepping,

39:18.175 --> 39:20.175
then, God, I hope you do.

39:20.177 --> 39:21.744
Let's not waste any more time.

39:21.746 --> 39:24.046
We'll rest in peace
when we are dead.

39:24.048 --> 39:25.247
It's three against ten.

39:36.727 --> 39:37.760
Anyone takes another step,

39:37.762 --> 39:39.895
I'll pop this bone out
and I'll feed it to him.

39:39.897 --> 39:42.264
Get back. Get the fuck back.

39:42.266 --> 39:44.133
Dad? Dad.

39:44.135 --> 39:47.202
- Dad.
- Let go off Hank.

39:47.204 --> 39:50.039
Hank? Your name's Hank?

39:50.041 --> 39:51.974
You look more
like a princess to me.

39:51.976 --> 39:54.576
- All right...
- Hey, hey, hey.

39:54.578 --> 39:57.112
We're cool. We're cool.
Let him go.

40:01.585 --> 40:02.450
Hey, wait. That's my boy.

40:02.452 --> 40:04.519
- Wow, wow, wow.
- Dad, you're drunk.

40:04.521 --> 40:07.189
- Get him out of here pronto.
- Good idea.

40:07.191 --> 40:09.591
Let's go get drunk.

40:09.593 --> 40:11.862
I thought you guys
were done for today.

40:15.633 --> 40:17.833
Man. Stop.

40:17.835 --> 40:19.668
Come here.

40:19.670 --> 40:21.971
Son.

40:21.973 --> 40:23.538
I love you.

40:23.540 --> 40:24.206
I love you too, Dad.

40:24.208 --> 40:26.141
I really do.

40:26.944 --> 40:28.777
- Dad, Dad, Dad.
- Mr. Wittenburg.

40:28.779 --> 40:30.145
Oh, my God! No way.

40:30.147 --> 40:31.146
Yes way.

40:31.148 --> 40:32.915
Mr. Wittenburg ran right up

40:32.917 --> 40:35.784
to that first
Harley Sportster 883,

40:35.786 --> 40:38.721
stroke or no stroke,
before we could do anything,

40:38.723 --> 40:41.056
the tip of his boot
was pushing off.

40:41.058 --> 40:43.125
But he told you that night,
Rusty,

40:43.127 --> 40:44.028
"I love you."

40:45.129 --> 40:48.097
My God, that is a lovely story.

40:48.099 --> 40:50.299
Your dad was bad ass Wolf.

40:50.301 --> 40:51.602
Stroke and all.

40:52.303 --> 40:53.938
Here's to Mr. Wittenburg.

40:55.072 --> 40:56.674
Mr. Wittenburg.

40:57.675 --> 40:59.043
To you, Dad.

41:28.873 --> 41:32.076
Yeehaa! Boys, it's on.

41:36.614 --> 41:37.813
What the fuck?

41:37.815 --> 41:41.917
Well, I guess...

41:41.919 --> 41:43.052
I guess I better cut this out

41:43.054 --> 41:44.989
so you boys
can have it real quick.

42:07.144 --> 42:09.745
Okay, I'll get her home.

42:09.747 --> 42:11.282
I'll get everything ready.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.052
I want a word with Rusty.

42:17.154 --> 42:18.387
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi.

42:18.389 --> 42:19.755
How are you doing?

42:19.757 --> 42:21.223
- Wow.
- She got big.

42:21.225 --> 42:22.626
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:28.732 --> 42:30.701
I don't care about all
that mumbo jumbo out there.

42:34.071 --> 42:35.272
We'll get him back.

42:46.450 --> 42:48.350
Make sure he gets home, please.

42:48.352 --> 42:50.052
We're all coming home, okay?

42:50.054 --> 42:51.820
- Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

42:51.822 --> 42:55.057
I'll call you tonight and you
can stay whenever you need.

42:55.059 --> 42:56.892
Thanks.

42:58.262 --> 42:59.163
Thanks.

43:00.397 --> 43:01.897
Hey, hey.

43:01.899 --> 43:02.731
You okay?

43:02.733 --> 43:05.334
I just need to think
or something.

43:05.336 --> 43:07.236
You all right?

43:08.339 --> 43:09.340
Where are you going?

43:10.274 --> 43:13.008
I don't know, honestly.

43:13.010 --> 43:15.079
It could be something
as simple as Syria.

43:17.114 --> 43:18.013
Sure.

43:18.015 --> 43:20.149
As many times
as I've been through this,

43:20.151 --> 43:22.084
I never get used to it.

43:22.086 --> 43:23.385
I'm scared.

43:23.387 --> 43:24.755
I know.

43:25.756 --> 43:28.824
Oh, don't give me
that fake smile.

43:28.826 --> 43:30.926
All right. Get over here.

43:30.928 --> 43:32.895
Listen to me.

43:32.897 --> 43:34.131
I am not leaving you.

43:35.733 --> 43:38.133
I'll go do my nine-to-five,

43:38.135 --> 43:39.902
get in the train,

43:39.904 --> 43:41.272
come home to you guys,

43:42.206 --> 43:45.274
come home to the family,
to the new family.

43:46.177 --> 43:49.378
Hey, I love you.

43:49.380 --> 43:50.512
I love you, too.

44:05.462 --> 44:07.896
Do you have to blend in?

44:07.898 --> 44:09.364
You wanted that?

44:09.366 --> 44:10.968
I don't know.

44:17.341 --> 44:18.874
Honey.

44:18.876 --> 44:20.477
I don't wanna talk about it.

44:24.481 --> 44:25.416
Babe.

44:27.017 --> 44:28.185
I don't.

44:45.570 --> 44:49.438
Mommy is sad because you have
to go to work again, huh?

44:49.440 --> 44:50.507
Yeah.

44:51.710 --> 44:55.877
Hey, go give mommy a big hug
and tickle her for me, okay?

44:55.879 --> 44:57.512
Okay.

44:57.514 --> 44:59.047
Daddy?

44:59.049 --> 45:00.050
Huh?

45:02.253 --> 45:03.887
Never mind.

45:11.262 --> 45:15.130
I need you to take care
of mommy when I'm gone, okay?

45:15.132 --> 45:15.831
Okay.

45:15.833 --> 45:18.300
I'll only be gone a couple days.

45:18.302 --> 45:19.903
Promise.

45:21.105 --> 45:23.107
You're forgetting something.

45:28.879 --> 45:30.412
There you go.

45:30.414 --> 45:32.850
Now your promise is sealed.

45:37.855 --> 45:39.256
I love you, Daddy.

45:41.292 --> 45:42.793
Hey.

45:44.128 --> 45:46.163
Now you go
take care of Mommy, okay?

45:47.398 --> 45:50.200
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.

46:16.628 --> 46:18.295
Wait, Rus.

46:30.307 --> 46:32.142
I love you.

46:39.149 --> 46:42.150
Hey, I'm coming back.

46:42.152 --> 46:44.554
I'm not gonna miss this.

46:44.556 --> 46:47.958
But what if something happens
that you can't control?

46:50.494 --> 46:52.597
I'm coming back,
and that's all I know.

46:53.997 --> 46:55.397
All right?

46:55.399 --> 46:56.566
All right?

46:56.568 --> 46:59.301
Hey, you trust me?

46:59.303 --> 47:02.104
You trust me?

47:03.540 --> 47:05.342
I fucking love you.

47:21.492 --> 47:23.593
<i>She's leaving me, Wolf.</i>

47:23.595 --> 47:25.695
She's really fucking leaving.

47:25.697 --> 47:28.198
She tells me
I've been gone too long.

47:30.067 --> 47:32.102
What kind of excuse is that?

47:33.303 --> 47:35.139
I know I've been gone too long.

47:36.507 --> 47:38.473
We need to drag it up.

47:38.475 --> 47:41.042
Let her the fuck go right now.

47:41.044 --> 47:42.479
Sunny.

47:44.716 --> 47:46.283
let her go.

47:49.453 --> 47:51.054
Clear this.

47:52.322 --> 47:54.189
Clear this.

47:54.191 --> 47:55.526
Are we good?

47:56.728 --> 47:57.695
Yeah.

47:59.731 --> 48:01.331
Are we good?

48:06.236 --> 48:08.005
That's Sunny.

48:12.309 --> 48:14.242
<i>All units,
this is Seven November Golf.</i>

48:14.244 --> 48:17.381
<i>While you're down...</i>

48:22.687 --> 48:24.419
What's the verdict, Pope?

48:24.421 --> 48:25.755
Surprise us and tell us

48:25.757 --> 48:28.356
we're going after someone
other than sand niggers?

48:28.358 --> 48:30.392
I love it
when you talk dirty to me.

48:30.394 --> 48:32.162
Gather around
and shut the fuck up.

48:34.599 --> 48:36.298
They're gonna fill you in more,
but basically,

48:36.300 --> 48:38.066
four of our Delta Operatives
went dark

48:38.068 --> 48:40.736
after they crossed
into Iranian territory,

48:40.738 --> 48:42.605
and that's all I know.

48:42.607 --> 48:44.539
Search and Rescue?

48:44.541 --> 48:45.440
That's all I know.

48:48.646 --> 48:50.247
Gentlemen.

48:55.519 --> 48:57.385
Senior.

48:57.387 --> 48:59.154
Slayers.

48:59.156 --> 49:02.157
Your objective
is special reconnaissance.

49:02.159 --> 49:03.360
Counter terrorist operation.

49:04.495 --> 49:07.431
This mission will be
code named Gold Quilt.

49:08.499 --> 49:10.232
Major Boggs.

49:10.234 --> 49:11.634
Senior.

49:11.636 --> 49:14.135
Fifty-eight hours ago,
a four-man Delta unit

49:14.137 --> 49:15.805
was dropped off
in the Farah province

49:15.807 --> 49:17.840
on a Recon
and Surveillance mission

49:17.842 --> 49:20.509
that would maneuver
across Iranian border.

49:20.511 --> 49:22.678
We have intel
that several high value targets

49:22.680 --> 49:26.414
from multiple terrorist factions
are collaborating and supporting

49:26.416 --> 49:29.518
a rapidly growing ISIS
element new to the area.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.722
We believe that they are
utilizing this location in Iran

49:32.724 --> 49:34.724
to develop biochemical weapons.

49:34.726 --> 49:36.258
Not gonna lie, guys,

49:36.260 --> 49:38.460
comms have been giving us
a fucking headache.

49:38.462 --> 49:40.630
Six hours into the op,
we lost all contact.

49:40.632 --> 49:42.798
It's imperative that we get eyes
on the ground

49:42.800 --> 49:44.301
down there immediately.

49:45.502 --> 49:48.537
Sunny, you're the best we have.

49:48.539 --> 49:49.639
Be prepared.

49:49.641 --> 49:51.674
Recent intel tells us
the Iranians are conducting

49:51.676 --> 49:55.377
solid MIJI operations against
our communications hardware.

49:55.379 --> 49:56.547
Copy that.

49:58.148 --> 49:58.814
Senior.

49:58.816 --> 50:00.883
IC knows the MIJI component

50:00.885 --> 50:03.418
and they're working
quick to counter.

50:03.420 --> 50:06.388
A satellite imagery shows
the mine

50:06.390 --> 50:08.456
to be abandoned during daylight.

50:08.458 --> 50:14.296
However, there has been vehicle
drop-offs and runs at night.

50:14.298 --> 50:16.066
Activities has picked up,

50:16.801 --> 50:19.234
which is of grave concern.

50:19.236 --> 50:24.239
SIGNET also suggests there
is an underground facility.

50:24.241 --> 50:27.779
We need to know every single
thing about this location.

50:28.680 --> 50:32.514
Entry points,
non-roads, wind direction.

50:32.516 --> 50:36.652
You'll be working
under extremely diverse terrain.

50:36.654 --> 50:40.522
Weather pattern
has been unpredictable.

50:40.524 --> 50:41.724
Questions?

50:41.726 --> 50:42.758
Speak up.

50:42.760 --> 50:43.728
Lieutenant?

50:44.662 --> 50:46.194
What about QRF?

50:46.196 --> 50:47.830
No QRF.

50:47.832 --> 50:49.230
Is that even possible?

50:49.232 --> 50:50.300
It is.

50:51.435 --> 50:53.501
You'll be dropped over here

50:53.503 --> 50:55.337
at an Afghani territory.

50:55.339 --> 50:58.306
This is as far
as air support can go.

50:58.308 --> 51:01.543
United States
has no air jurisdiction.

51:01.545 --> 51:03.846
So when you pass over
the Iranian border,

51:03.848 --> 51:05.781
you are on your own.

51:05.783 --> 51:08.185
Again, we may not have comms.

51:09.252 --> 51:11.787
Sync your count down.
Don't miss your window.

51:11.789 --> 51:14.957
Senior, do we have any type
of overhead or pattern analysis

51:14.959 --> 51:17.760
by night on vehicles
or personnel?

51:17.762 --> 51:19.260
Nothing substantial.

51:19.262 --> 51:20.832
Armed guards been on rotation.

51:21.833 --> 51:23.701
How many? Can't tell.

51:24.602 --> 51:26.468
They're all hooded,
they look the same.

51:26.470 --> 51:29.572
We do not have
high level surveillance

51:29.574 --> 51:31.272
due to no-fly zone.

51:31.274 --> 51:33.676
That's one detail
we need to find out.

51:33.678 --> 51:36.579
There are red flags popping up
all over the place on this one.

51:36.581 --> 51:38.714
We were lucky
to discover it when we did.

51:38.716 --> 51:40.785
Do not mistake
it's vacant appearance.

51:42.219 --> 51:43.621
We believe it may be a hive.

51:44.756 --> 51:45.554
Rusty.

51:45.556 --> 51:48.256
So nothing
on the Delta Operators?

51:48.258 --> 51:49.224
I'm afraid not.

51:49.226 --> 51:52.260
Your objective
is detailed reconnaissance.

51:52.262 --> 51:53.629
Don't be compromised.

51:53.631 --> 51:55.665
We need you to snoop and poop.

51:55.667 --> 51:56.464
Rusty.

51:56.466 --> 51:58.366
So why not
just send the two of us?

51:58.368 --> 51:59.702
Yeah.

51:59.704 --> 52:00.936
No can do.

52:00.938 --> 52:03.606
As you can see,
too much ground to cover.

52:03.608 --> 52:05.306
We need you to split up.

52:05.308 --> 52:08.376
We need you in and out,
twelve hours.

52:08.378 --> 52:10.846
We're going to set you up
with a Wi-Fi system.

52:10.848 --> 52:12.982
Your intel
will come back encrypted.

52:12.984 --> 52:15.584
Team Leader
will designate as needed

52:15.586 --> 52:19.387
and conduct
a full CONOP prior to insert.

52:19.389 --> 52:22.390
You'll need
to fill multiple roles.

52:22.392 --> 52:23.695
Anything else?

52:27.497 --> 52:29.232
You leave in 45.

52:30.467 --> 52:31.967
Slayers,

52:31.969 --> 52:33.301
kick ass.

52:33.303 --> 52:35.403
Get us what we need.

52:35.405 --> 52:36.806
Godspeed,

52:36.808 --> 52:37.942
fair wind.

52:39.944 --> 52:41.478
Have a good mission men.

52:43.280 --> 52:43.948
Stu.

52:45.282 --> 52:46.514
How's your new addition?

52:46.516 --> 52:47.850
He's amazing.

52:47.852 --> 52:49.519
Thanks for asking, Janet.

52:55.827 --> 52:58.027
Cheer up.

52:58.029 --> 52:58.994
It's kind of messed up

52:58.996 --> 53:00.497
we wouldn't
be addressing the Delta team.

53:01.833 --> 53:04.600
Not gonna lie,
I thought the same thing.

53:04.602 --> 53:06.003
No air assets?

53:07.004 --> 53:09.839
Senior Chief has got upper crust
shitting down his neck,

53:09.841 --> 53:12.641
that means he's
gonna shit down us.

53:12.643 --> 53:15.445
This is not
a Search and Rescue mission.

53:16.581 --> 53:19.481
CBRNE takes priority.

53:19.483 --> 53:22.685
The mission takes priority
over everything.

53:22.687 --> 53:24.622
So quit your bitching.

53:27.390 --> 53:28.492
All right.

53:29.526 --> 53:30.762
Gold Quilt.

53:35.867 --> 53:39.635
Okay, Phase One insert
is Burt, 2300.

53:39.637 --> 53:41.003
Now, Scorpion, congrats,

53:41.005 --> 53:42.872
you're assistant team lead
and point in this.

53:42.874 --> 53:43.973
Don't forget your bible.

53:43.975 --> 53:45.342
I won't, sir.

53:46.778 --> 53:48.476
Now I'm a second and meds.

53:48.478 --> 53:49.912
Since we don't have
any breeches in this,

53:49.914 --> 53:52.547
Casper and Rooster,
you're gonna take the rear.

53:52.549 --> 53:55.785
Now, we're gonna move west
along this tree line here

53:55.787 --> 53:57.519
till we get to the rally point.

53:57.521 --> 53:59.422
That's Phase Two, Kermit.

54:00.691 --> 54:04.794
And, Sunny, you're designated
RTO in this 'cause you're...

54:04.796 --> 54:06.461
You're the best we got.

54:06.463 --> 54:08.097
That's what Darla said.

54:08.099 --> 54:09.531
Oh...

54:09.533 --> 54:10.835
Sunny side up.

54:12.603 --> 54:13.803
Seriously, you heard them.

54:13.805 --> 54:15.436
Something
is giving comms a headache.

54:15.438 --> 54:18.007
So when you get there,
get all the comms tethered.

54:18.009 --> 54:20.475
Make sure all of our radios,
including our whispers,

54:20.477 --> 54:22.645
are synced and encrypted
in the latest freqs.

54:22.647 --> 54:24.980
We're already FUBAR
with this no-fly zone shit.

54:24.982 --> 54:26.916
Naked as a fuck.

54:26.918 --> 54:29.151
- Good?
- Good.

54:29.153 --> 54:30.119
Now, Casper and Scorpion,

54:30.121 --> 54:32.121
you're gonna remain back here
with Sunny.

54:32.123 --> 54:33.423
Sit tight and stay alert.

54:34.659 --> 54:38.093
Now, Little Mann and Rooster,
you guys are blue overwatch.

54:38.095 --> 54:40.395
You're gonna come up here
and nest in right over here.

54:40.397 --> 54:41.833
God, I love you, sir.

54:42.967 --> 54:44.867
Okay, now, Wolf and I
are gonna be green,

54:44.869 --> 54:45.835
heading northeast here.

54:45.837 --> 54:48.503
We're going to nest
in right about there.

54:48.505 --> 54:50.005
We're gonna be
in these positions for a while,

54:50.007 --> 54:51.406
so get me everything.

54:51.408 --> 54:53.943
Detail, detail, detail.
Don't be lazy.

54:53.945 --> 54:57.412
They gave us this one
for a reason. Make us look good.

54:57.414 --> 54:59.748
Exfil will be 0930.

54:59.750 --> 55:02.517
This will be Phase Four,
Cookie Monster.

55:02.519 --> 55:03.953
Now relay back to rally point

55:03.955 --> 55:05.855
and then we're gonna head
for home base.

55:05.857 --> 55:07.857
Phase five, Ernie, 1100,

55:07.859 --> 55:09.892
which is also
our drop dead time.

55:09.894 --> 55:10.993
Now if you guys miss that one,

55:10.995 --> 55:12.061
you might as well get
a green card,

55:12.063 --> 55:13.931
'cause you're gonna
be staying a fucking while.

55:18.135 --> 55:21.672
You're the most loyal, toughest
sons of bitches I ever met.

55:22.740 --> 55:24.909
It is an honor to roll with you.

55:29.180 --> 55:31.914
All right, Slayers,
we'll be moving quickly.

55:31.916 --> 55:35.684
Get your Desert Dragon skins on,
cowboy up and lets jam.

55:35.686 --> 55:36.719
You've got 20 Mike,

55:36.721 --> 55:40.089
and we're off to the land
of the Great Pashtun.

55:40.091 --> 55:41.959
Let's do it. Move out.

55:43.060 --> 55:44.459
Here we go.

55:44.461 --> 55:45.663
Let's do this, guys.

56:24.602 --> 56:27.670
<i>Team Leader,
you are about five Mikes out.</i>

56:27.672 --> 56:28.773
Rooster.

56:31.008 --> 56:32.808
Sun rises in six hours.

56:32.810 --> 56:34.576
We got a good mile
and a half height ahead of us,

56:34.578 --> 56:35.911
so we have to high tail it.

56:35.913 --> 56:37.680
Second boots are down,
secure the parameter.

56:37.682 --> 56:38.647
ABC's.

56:38.649 --> 56:39.949
We're gonna stay as single unit,

56:39.951 --> 56:42.517
so we're about two
and a half miles out at Kermit.

56:42.519 --> 56:44.787
Drop Dead is at eleven
hundred so don't be late.

56:44.789 --> 56:46.557
Let's go home
in one piece, Slayers.

56:54.098 --> 56:55.965
This is Rally Kermit.

56:55.967 --> 56:57.866
Sunny, hook up comms.

56:57.868 --> 56:58.934
Stay dark.

56:58.936 --> 57:01.172
Do not break radio silence
until you hit your POS.

57:02.206 --> 57:04.773
At 0930, start
getting your asses back here,

57:04.775 --> 57:06.675
we'll make our way
to extraction point.

57:06.677 --> 57:07.910
Copy.

57:07.912 --> 57:10.045
Sunny, you good with comms?

57:10.047 --> 57:12.681
- I'm on it.
- Good.

57:12.683 --> 57:15.019
If you are compromised,
pass Taylor Swift.

57:16.220 --> 57:17.088
Stay frosty.

57:59.930 --> 58:02.099
I don't see one
single goat fucker out there.

58:15.046 --> 58:17.679
Nothing but sand and dust.

58:53.717 --> 58:55.651
I'm dead.

59:40.397 --> 59:43.100
Yikes! You got hairy!

59:44.735 --> 59:46.702
Hi, Gusty, Rusty, Shmusty.

59:55.212 --> 59:57.212
As long as you're
within my reach,

59:57.214 --> 59:58.949
I can protect you from them.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.256
I'm afraid
that won't do much good here.

01:00:11.896 --> 01:00:12.963
Told you.

01:00:14.765 --> 01:00:17.034
I got you these the other day.

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.304
Do I know you?

01:00:22.306 --> 01:00:24.740
They don't like strangers.

01:00:24.742 --> 01:00:26.275
I've tried to tell them
about you,

01:00:26.277 --> 01:00:27.843
but they don't seem to care.

01:00:27.845 --> 01:00:29.044
Who's they?

01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:30.881
The wickeds and the scurries.

01:00:36.754 --> 01:00:38.088
Who's the...

01:00:42.126 --> 01:00:43.325
Little girl?

01:00:48.032 --> 01:00:49.433
Little girl!

01:00:56.006 --> 01:00:57.973
Huh.

01:00:57.975 --> 01:01:00.209
What's a blue jay
doing out here?

01:01:00.211 --> 01:01:03.047
Well, as long as he keeps
singing, we'll be all right.

01:01:07.017 --> 01:01:09.885
You know, she's never seen
the Northern Lights.

01:01:09.887 --> 01:01:11.455
It's time to take her, then.

01:01:12.823 --> 01:01:14.389
Yeah.

01:01:14.391 --> 01:01:16.427
She's always wanted to do that.

01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:24.835
Twenty Mikes.

01:01:27.438 --> 01:01:29.440
Copy that. Twenty.

01:01:33.377 --> 01:01:34.778
What?

01:01:36.814 --> 01:01:40.084
I was thinking
about your Pavarotti bird story.

01:01:44.488 --> 01:01:46.421
"Have you heard this all
in the mocking bird?"

01:01:48.025 --> 01:01:50.227
- Yeah, that's the one.
- Is it?

01:01:53.197 --> 01:01:55.297
Yeah.

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:58.533
Little mocking bird
sat in my window sill.

01:01:58.535 --> 01:02:00.137
I was about ten years old.

01:02:01.972 --> 01:02:06.375
Every day
it'd start singing at dawn,

01:02:06.377 --> 01:02:08.012
wake my ass up.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.546
And then

01:02:11.548 --> 01:02:17.019
just this incredible data pool,
I mean, they remember

01:02:17.021 --> 01:02:21.290
everything that they hear
day after day until they die.

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:23.091
I mean, everything.

01:02:23.093 --> 01:02:27.431
Car horns, buses,
melodies from other birds.

01:02:28.566 --> 01:02:30.600
And I shit you not,

01:02:30.602 --> 01:02:33.201
if this thing heard
a piano concerto,

01:02:33.203 --> 01:02:37.141
he could spit it back at you
note by note perfectly.

01:02:38.242 --> 01:02:41.011
I mean, they mimic anything
and everything.

01:02:43.581 --> 01:02:47.082
So it would
wake me up every day.

01:02:47.084 --> 01:02:51.186
And what I'd do,

01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:53.021
I'd count his different noises,

01:02:53.023 --> 01:02:56.460
like counting sheep, you know,
so I'd fall back asleep.

01:02:58.095 --> 01:03:00.495
This one day,

01:03:00.497 --> 01:03:05.334
I swear to God, he did over
a hundred different noises.

01:03:05.336 --> 01:03:06.602
It was amazing.

01:03:06.604 --> 01:03:09.938
A fucking Pavarotti bird.

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.174
And...

01:03:12.176 --> 01:03:13.410
I fell back asleep.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.349
About a week later, uh...

01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:22.217
It woke me up.

01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:24.421
I counted, fell asleep.

01:03:25.456 --> 01:03:30.961
Next thing you know,
sound of a. 22 wakes me up.

01:03:34.164 --> 01:03:36.133
Neighbor fucking shot him.

01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:41.438
You know what the moral
of the story is?

01:03:44.475 --> 01:03:47.244
Always go out doing
something that you love.

01:03:49.346 --> 01:03:52.416
- Pavarotti bird.
- Pavarotti bird.

01:04:05.496 --> 01:04:07.429
Castle reaching
departure time, over.

01:04:10.568 --> 01:04:13.669
Castle reaching
departure time, over.

01:04:21.445 --> 01:04:23.579
We definitely
got some interference.

01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:25.082
We're being jammed.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.583
Smooth.

01:04:27.585 --> 01:04:29.486
Just how I like it.

01:04:31.422 --> 01:04:32.722
Gotta trust, Sunny.

01:04:32.724 --> 01:04:35.524
Not in the sunshine yet.

01:04:35.526 --> 01:04:39.029
Well, this will keep
the clouds away.

01:04:55.613 --> 01:04:57.214
Almost game time.

01:05:03.086 --> 01:05:05.086
Mm.

01:05:05.088 --> 01:05:06.724
Breakfast of champions.

01:05:09.761 --> 01:05:12.329
Better save some
of that for the ride home.

01:05:18.135 --> 01:05:20.736
That's a wrap, Wolf.

01:05:20.738 --> 01:05:22.270
Let's go home.

01:05:22.272 --> 01:05:23.608
I like the sound of that.

01:05:24.809 --> 01:05:27.478
Kermit, Green, over.

01:05:37.555 --> 01:05:40.023
<i>Cookie Monster,
Green copy.</i>

01:05:51.168 --> 01:05:53.203
- Easy breezy.
- Nice and cheesy.

01:06:08.519 --> 01:06:09.754
Oh, shit.

01:06:12.155 --> 01:06:13.756
What you got?

01:06:13.758 --> 01:06:16.493
Seven hostiles, two hostages.

01:06:30.708 --> 01:06:32.710
Execution squad.
Just what I wanted.

01:06:33.678 --> 01:06:35.544
Are those our boys?

01:06:35.546 --> 01:06:37.145
Oh, standby.

01:06:37.147 --> 01:06:40.450
Hostiles are armed
with AK-47's and secondaries.

01:06:41.686 --> 01:06:45.122
They got a tripod and recorder.
Two machetes.

01:06:45.823 --> 01:06:47.692
Waiting for confirmation.

01:06:49.126 --> 01:06:51.563
Gotta give us something.
Come on, baby.

01:06:52.462 --> 01:06:54.431
Looks like they came out
of that rock formation.

01:06:59.169 --> 01:07:01.369
Right there.

01:07:01.371 --> 01:07:02.872
Chapman.

01:07:02.874 --> 01:07:04.508
We're running out of time.

01:07:07.579 --> 01:07:10.680
Lieutenant Blake Chapman, what
have you gotten yourself into?

01:07:10.682 --> 01:07:12.280
Something's off.

01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:14.249
They'd be expecting a rescue.

01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:15.751
Using us as bait.

01:07:15.753 --> 01:07:17.319
Might already know we're here.

01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:19.889
I'm thinking
the exact same thing.

01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:22.524
We touch anything down there
and we're compromised.

01:07:22.526 --> 01:07:23.828
It's a perfect trap.

01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:26.564
We got what we came for.

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:32.704
- We're running out of time.
- No.

01:07:33.938 --> 01:07:37.238
No. How do we justify that, huh?

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.242
These are somebody's kids.

01:07:41.879 --> 01:07:43.848
We're frogmen, sir.

01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:47.351
Good Wolf.

01:07:50.688 --> 01:07:53.421
Taylor Swift. I say again,
Taylor Swift, Slayers.

01:07:53.423 --> 01:07:54.222
Change of plans.

01:07:54.224 --> 01:07:55.323
<i>We are on the fly.</i>

01:07:55.325 --> 01:07:57.960
<i>Green has a PID
on one of our Delta Operators.</i>

01:07:57.962 --> 01:08:00.796
<i>We are on a rescue.
Blue hold tight at Oscar.</i>

01:08:00.798 --> 01:08:03.966
<i>Scorpion, Casper,
I need you for back up at pivot.</i>

01:08:03.968 --> 01:08:05.233
Sam, hell!

01:08:05.235 --> 01:08:06.902
Fucking A!

01:08:06.904 --> 01:08:08.536
Roger that.

01:08:08.538 --> 01:08:10.307
Let's move.

01:08:11.943 --> 01:08:14.677
Courtesy-Six. This is Avalanche.

01:08:14.679 --> 01:08:16.310
Taylor Swift.

01:08:16.313 --> 01:08:18.212
I repeat, Taylor Swift.

01:08:18.215 --> 01:08:21.216
We have PID
on one of our Delta operators.

01:08:21.218 --> 01:08:23.786
We are shifting to rescue.

01:08:23.787 --> 01:08:24.920
Over.

01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:26.421
Casper, meet you at pivot point.

01:08:26.423 --> 01:08:27.558
Scorpion, over.

01:08:39.804 --> 01:08:42.372
<i>Little Mann has eyes
on the lynch mob.</i>

01:08:44.975 --> 01:08:47.542
<i>I do not have eyes
on you, Green.</i>

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.312
I need you
to position over there.

01:08:51.314 --> 01:08:52.915
Cover my ass.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:53.749
I'm going in with you.

01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:56.283
No. Keep your battle
at a distance.

01:08:56.286 --> 01:08:58.787
Watch my ass.

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:01.023
Pope!

01:09:01.024 --> 01:09:03.457
Green is at pivot.
Pope is moving in fast.

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:04.694
Little Mann, stand by to engage.

01:09:04.696 --> 01:09:06.394
Over.

01:09:06.395 --> 01:09:07.930
Scorpion, what's your POS?

01:09:07.932 --> 01:09:10.765
Little Mann is taking tango
with machete

01:09:10.768 --> 01:09:13.537
on hostage closest to my POS.

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:18.305
Engage targets at the end
of my countdown on zero.

01:09:18.308 --> 01:09:19.675
Over.

01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:21.276
What the fuck's happening?

01:09:21.278 --> 01:09:23.345
The Hadjis
are about to be pissed.

01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:28.349
Copy, Little. I got tango
on your two, on your trigger.

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:29.319
Over.

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:47.604
Vanessa!

01:09:48.773 --> 01:09:50.575
Vanessa!

01:09:58.683 --> 01:10:00.383
Vanessa!

01:10:08.893 --> 01:10:10.695
Vanessa!

01:10:20.605 --> 01:10:22.039
I know you're there.

01:10:23.908 --> 01:10:25.608
Why are you playing games?

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:27.645
You like hide and seek.

01:10:28.846 --> 01:10:31.816
- What's your purpose?
- What's your purpose?

01:10:33.851 --> 01:10:35.885
You left your flowers.

01:10:35.887 --> 01:10:38.721
I picked them for you, each one.

01:10:38.723 --> 01:10:40.992
Now they're all dead.

01:10:42.359 --> 01:10:43.393
Your friends are back.

01:10:44.829 --> 01:10:46.762
Wouldn't call them friends

01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:48.998
if you knew
what they wanted from you.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.933
They don't like you.

01:10:50.935 --> 01:10:52.367
I don't like them.

01:10:52.369 --> 01:10:53.936
And take that silly thing off.

01:10:53.938 --> 01:10:56.437
Who is Vanessa?

01:10:56.439 --> 01:10:58.073
What's a soul-taker?

01:10:58.075 --> 01:10:59.909
How many souls have you taken?

01:10:59.911 --> 01:11:01.811
- I said take it off.
- Take it off.

01:11:01.813 --> 01:11:03.047
I heard you.

01:11:04.081 --> 01:11:06.416
You don't know who I am, do you?

01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:09.852
Take it off.

01:11:09.854 --> 01:11:11.856
Take it off for me.

01:11:20.631 --> 01:11:22.164
Boo!

01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:24.867
What? You expect something else?

01:11:24.869 --> 01:11:26.168
Vanessa?

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:28.469
Scorpion, six Mikes out.

01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:30.875
Casper, three Mikes out.
Do you copy?

01:11:34.477 --> 01:11:35.613
Say something.

01:11:37.447 --> 01:11:38.816
I'm sorry about the flowers.

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:42.084
Now, make them go away.

01:11:42.086 --> 01:11:44.720
The wickeds and the scurries?

01:11:44.722 --> 01:11:45.988
I can't.

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:47.089
Then what can you do?

01:11:47.091 --> 01:11:49.625
Geez! Lighten up.

01:11:49.627 --> 01:11:51.994
I just wanna play with you.

01:11:51.996 --> 01:11:53.629
Listen, I don't have much time.

01:11:53.631 --> 01:11:54.799
I need to get home.

01:11:55.933 --> 01:11:58.133
Will you help me with that?

01:11:58.135 --> 01:12:00.537
I'm not allowed to say.

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:07.912
Tell me why I'm here.

01:12:09.512 --> 01:12:11.180
What are we running from?

01:12:11.182 --> 01:12:13.582
Not "we", you.

01:12:13.584 --> 01:12:14.952
You're the one running.

01:12:19.489 --> 01:12:20.858
Watch out behind you!

01:12:27.098 --> 01:12:30.833
<i>Three...</i>

01:12:30.835 --> 01:12:31.936
<i>Two...</i>

01:12:34.906 --> 01:12:36.107
...one.

01:12:46.918 --> 01:12:48.984
Little, this is Wolf.

01:12:48.986 --> 01:12:51.622
You are Pope's overwatch.
I'm pinned down.

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.194
Too fucking close.

01:13:01.999 --> 01:13:03.632
Little, we got company.

01:13:03.634 --> 01:13:04.900
Fuck.

01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:06.602
Blue is compromised.

01:13:06.604 --> 01:13:08.673
Hold them off.
I can't leave Pope hanging.

01:13:26.757 --> 01:13:28.590
Oh, fuck!

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.613
Hey, Chapman, easy.

01:14:57.615 --> 01:14:59.681
Easy. Hey, hey. Easy, easy.

01:14:59.683 --> 01:15:01.750
SEAL Team Three.
We're gonna get you home.

01:15:01.752 --> 01:15:02.951
Oh, thank... thank God.

01:15:02.953 --> 01:15:04.887
I can't see anything.

01:15:04.889 --> 01:15:05.821
They blinded me.

01:15:05.823 --> 01:15:07.289
They fucked us up, man.
Where's Griego?

01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:08.791
Griego is gone, okay?

01:15:08.793 --> 01:15:09.725
Can you run?

01:15:09.727 --> 01:15:11.693
- I can try.
- Okay.

01:15:11.695 --> 01:15:14.730
We gotta go. Hang on to my vest.

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:21.336
You okay?

01:15:21.338 --> 01:15:23.105
Yeah, I'm good.

01:15:23.107 --> 01:15:24.608
Let's go.

01:15:34.819 --> 01:15:36.418
Push right.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:39.188
Scorpion, move right.
Move right.

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:40.756
Tangos on your nine o'clock.

01:15:40.758 --> 01:15:42.893
Scorpion,
where the fuck are you?

01:15:56.273 --> 01:15:57.341
Mag.

01:16:03.914 --> 01:16:04.947
Cas!

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.718
Casper!

01:16:21.132 --> 01:16:22.364
Wolf!

01:16:26.337 --> 01:16:29.304
What's going on?

01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:31.740
Pope, man, you okay?

01:16:32.409 --> 01:16:34.710
Wolf.

01:16:34.712 --> 01:16:36.747
Those sons of bitches
blinded him.

01:16:38.015 --> 01:16:40.782
Lieutenant Chapman, I'm Wolfman,
part of your rescue.

01:16:40.784 --> 01:16:42.084
Thank you.

01:16:46.423 --> 01:16:48.357
, Pope is down.

01:16:48.359 --> 01:16:50.192
Westerly coordinates A5, A6, A7.

01:16:50.194 --> 01:16:52.494
Sunny, do you copy? Over.

01:16:55.299 --> 01:16:57.966
- What's happening?
- Nothing's happening.

01:16:57.968 --> 01:17:01.870
Dude, make sure she sees
the Northern Lights.

01:17:01.872 --> 01:17:04.773
- You're gonna take care, Pope.
- What's happening?

01:17:04.775 --> 01:17:06.742
Nothing.

01:17:08.112 --> 01:17:10.279
Goddammit. Here.
Put pressure on there.

01:17:10.981 --> 01:17:13.048
Westerly coordinates A5, A6, A7.

01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:14.183
Sunny, come in. Do you copy?

01:17:14.185 --> 01:17:16.785
Goddammit.
Pope, hang in there, buddy.

01:17:16.787 --> 01:17:18.020
Wolf.

01:17:18.022 --> 01:17:22.927
Wolf, you get his heels
on American soil.

01:17:26.864 --> 01:17:28.332
Good Wolf.

01:17:29.533 --> 01:17:31.099
God damn it, Pope.

01:17:31.101 --> 01:17:32.367
Hold it! Fucking...

01:17:32.369 --> 01:17:35.103
Come on! Wake the fuck up, man!

01:17:35.105 --> 01:17:36.071
- Is he dead?
- Come on.

01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:37.139
Do something. What can I do?
Do something.

01:17:37.141 --> 01:17:39.208
All right. Get the fuck back
to me, fucking Pope.

01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:40.442
Come on, buddy.

01:17:40.444 --> 01:17:41.543
Pope.

01:17:45.416 --> 01:17:46.281
Is he gone?

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.454
Is he gone?

01:17:54.858 --> 01:17:55.759
Can you help him?

01:18:03.834 --> 01:18:05.100
Is he dead?

01:18:05.102 --> 01:18:06.437
Yeah, he's dead. Come on.

01:18:08.973 --> 01:18:11.006
Pope.

01:18:11.008 --> 01:18:12.874
Pope!

01:18:12.876 --> 01:18:14.211
Pope!

01:18:41.071 --> 01:18:42.273
Let's take a break.

01:18:45.042 --> 01:18:46.576
How are you feeling, Chap?

01:18:46.578 --> 01:18:48.243
Golden.

01:18:48.245 --> 01:18:50.846
Chap, we need a miracle.

01:18:50.848 --> 01:18:52.180
I'm praying.

01:18:52.182 --> 01:18:54.416
<i>Come in.</i>

01:18:54.418 --> 01:18:55.917
Lucas?

01:18:57.488 --> 01:18:59.622
- <i>Do you copy?</i>
- Scorpion, I read you.

01:18:59.624 --> 01:19:01.456
Do you copy? Over.

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:02.491
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:19:02.493 --> 01:19:04.893
<i>Sunny, yeah.</i>

01:19:04.895 --> 01:19:06.629
Scorpion,
Blue is moving to Kermit.

01:19:06.631 --> 01:19:07.929
Do you copy? Over.

01:19:07.931 --> 01:19:09.531
I say again.

01:19:09.533 --> 01:19:11.099
Blue is moving to Kermit.

01:19:11.101 --> 01:19:12.200
Over.

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:19.977
Scorpion, do you copy? O...

01:19:24.948 --> 01:19:27.482
What's wrong?

01:19:27.484 --> 01:19:28.586
We're at gunpoint.

01:19:32.156 --> 01:19:34.624
- What can I do?
- Stay put.

01:19:34.626 --> 01:19:37.259
- I can distract them.
- No, no, no. Just stay put.

01:19:37.261 --> 01:19:38.960
Just stay...

01:19:40.464 --> 01:19:42.232
- Still with me?
- I'm still here.

01:19:44.602 --> 01:19:46.503
But we gotta go.

01:19:49.139 --> 01:19:50.507
Incoming!

01:19:53.344 --> 01:19:54.545
Sunny!

01:19:57.114 --> 01:19:59.348
I'm good.

01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:01.385
Fuck you motherfuckers!

01:20:09.226 --> 01:20:11.293
Go, go.

01:20:11.295 --> 01:20:12.628
Come on, let's get them.

01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:13.631
Go!

01:20:19.637 --> 01:20:21.238
It's Wolf.

01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:26.074
Casper.

01:20:26.076 --> 01:20:28.410
Good to see you.

01:20:28.412 --> 01:20:30.545
- So, where's Pope?
- He didn't make it.

01:20:30.547 --> 01:20:32.715
- Pope's gone?
- Pope's gone?

01:20:32.717 --> 01:20:34.249
This is
Lieutenant Blake Chapman.

01:20:34.251 --> 01:20:35.984
The fuckers blinded him.

01:20:35.986 --> 01:20:37.587
Pope wants his heels back
on American soil,

01:20:37.589 --> 01:20:39.421
so that's what we're going to.

01:20:39.423 --> 01:20:41.957
Lieutenant Chapman. I'm Casper.

01:20:41.959 --> 01:20:43.325
Welcome to Dragon Slayers.

01:20:43.327 --> 01:20:45.561
I'm fucking indebted.

01:20:45.563 --> 01:20:49.464
LT, you're with the best frogmen
on the whole planet.

01:20:49.466 --> 01:20:52.167
We'll get you home safe.
I'm Sunny.

01:20:52.169 --> 01:20:53.969
It's a fucking honor.

01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:56.304
All right, you three
get to the extraction zone.

01:20:56.306 --> 01:20:57.272
I'll cover the rear.

01:20:57.274 --> 01:21:00.075
Sunny, get Blue team
and Scorpion on comms.

01:21:00.077 --> 01:21:01.977
Negative, Wolf. No comms.

01:21:01.979 --> 01:21:03.313
There's no fucking comms?

01:21:04.415 --> 01:21:06.014
No. Negative on the bird.

01:21:06.016 --> 01:21:08.684
Nothing but drop-dead time
coming fast.

01:21:08.686 --> 01:21:11.355
All right, Initiate E&E.
Sunny, take the lead.

01:21:28.706 --> 01:21:30.505
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.

01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:33.709
I'm a World War II fighter ace.

01:21:37.649 --> 01:21:38.714
Who am I?

01:21:38.716 --> 01:21:40.282
You can be me.

01:21:43.487 --> 01:21:45.487
I wanna be somebody cool.

01:21:52.029 --> 01:21:53.596
Mayday! Mayday!

01:21:53.598 --> 01:21:56.064
We're coming in
for a crash landing.

01:21:56.066 --> 01:21:57.332
Brr.

01:22:00.237 --> 01:22:02.404
They got me.

01:22:02.406 --> 01:22:05.375
They really got me this time.

01:22:07.211 --> 01:22:08.744
We lost bogey one on radar.

01:22:08.746 --> 01:22:11.683
I think he ten-foured out
of the air, roger dodger.

01:22:13.083 --> 01:22:14.619
What a war.

01:22:20.758 --> 01:22:22.224
How was that?

01:22:22.226 --> 01:22:23.659
Why, hm,

01:22:23.661 --> 01:22:26.829
I give you C minus, my
gallant knight.

01:22:26.831 --> 01:22:28.631
Wow.

01:22:28.633 --> 01:22:31.399
I thought at least a B.

01:22:31.401 --> 01:22:32.534
You thought wrong.

01:22:32.536 --> 01:22:34.102
You are all dirty.

01:22:34.104 --> 01:22:36.404
And yes, I am a tough critic.

01:22:42.312 --> 01:22:44.481
You still
don't remember me, do you?

01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:55.390
What are you gonna bring
for show and tell Friday?

01:23:11.275 --> 01:23:12.575
Stay here.

01:23:12.577 --> 01:23:14.679
Wait. Please don't leave me.

01:23:18.448 --> 01:23:21.851
It's still 25 Mikes
to the extraction point.

01:23:21.853 --> 01:23:23.251
About a mile away.

01:23:23.253 --> 01:23:24.887
All right, we'll hold up there

01:23:24.889 --> 01:23:27.255
until we're
about 15 minutes out.

01:23:27.257 --> 01:23:28.591
Copy that.

01:23:28.593 --> 01:23:31.661
Scorpion, do you copy? Over.

01:23:31.663 --> 01:23:34.229
I say again.
Scorpion, do you copy? Over.

01:23:34.231 --> 01:23:35.633
Scorpion's gone dark.

01:23:37.802 --> 01:23:39.534
All right.

01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:41.536
The SEAL is all we got, guys.

01:23:41.538 --> 01:23:44.439
- Casper, take our six.
- Copy.

01:23:44.441 --> 01:23:47.242
Casper? Stay alive.

01:23:47.244 --> 01:23:50.445
Copy.

01:23:51.583 --> 01:23:53.551
Let me open this for you.

01:23:57.321 --> 01:23:58.355
Okay.

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.696
Let me take a look at you.

01:24:08.866 --> 01:24:11.166
First thing they did

01:24:11.168 --> 01:24:14.202
was throw some kind of acid
in my eyes.

01:24:14.204 --> 01:24:15.671
The fucking bastards
made me listen to them

01:24:15.673 --> 01:24:17.809
tear apart my team leader.

01:24:19.376 --> 01:24:23.213
He took it like a fucking Delta.
Didn't say a word.

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.484
What was Pope's first name?

01:24:29.219 --> 01:24:30.853
Jerry.

01:24:30.855 --> 01:24:33.254
Jerry.

01:24:33.256 --> 01:24:35.925
Yeah, I like that. Jerry.

01:24:35.927 --> 01:24:37.760
I can see his face.

01:24:37.762 --> 01:24:40.963
He's a handsome motherfucker.

01:24:40.965 --> 01:24:42.499
He was.

01:24:43.635 --> 01:24:45.568
What's your first name?

01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:48.269
Wolf.

01:24:48.271 --> 01:24:49.841
Your real name?

01:24:54.478 --> 01:24:55.913
I'll tell you when we get home.

01:24:59.984 --> 01:25:02.920
My wife and son will be
really eager to meet all of you.

01:25:04.889 --> 01:25:05.823
Thank you.

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:09.393
You're welcome, man.

01:25:11.528 --> 01:25:12.728
All right.

01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:15.600
I want you to lay on your belly
and stay low, all right?

01:25:17.434 --> 01:25:19.234
Do you have an extra gun?

01:25:19.236 --> 01:25:20.437
Just in case, you know.

01:25:29.379 --> 01:25:32.815
You got three rounds.
Make them count.

01:25:35.252 --> 01:25:36.453
Three magic beans.

01:25:51.002 --> 01:25:52.870
Comms are toast, Wolf.

01:25:56.674 --> 01:25:58.275
You okay?

01:26:02.046 --> 01:26:05.313
Living the dream.

01:26:05.315 --> 01:26:06.784
Sunny side up.

01:26:13.925 --> 01:26:17.425
Wolf, we still got
20 fucking Mikes

01:26:17.427 --> 01:26:18.861
before extraction.

01:26:18.863 --> 01:26:20.631
We're about a mile out.

01:26:21.966 --> 01:26:25.634
Well, about six,
we'll hit a drop dead tunnel.

01:26:25.636 --> 01:26:29.439
Brother, I ain't got
no more arrows in the quiver.

01:26:30.942 --> 01:26:31.943
I'm out.

01:26:34.045 --> 01:26:36.411
All right.

01:26:36.413 --> 01:26:37.847
Scorpion?

01:26:37.849 --> 01:26:39.815
Scorpion?

01:26:39.817 --> 01:26:41.449
He's out there.

01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:43.953
Little Mann, Rooster?

01:26:43.955 --> 01:26:45.721
I haven't heard from them.

01:26:45.723 --> 01:26:48.624
You think they're dark?

01:26:48.626 --> 01:26:49.992
No.

01:26:49.994 --> 01:26:53.328
Goddammit.

01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:55.631
Hey, don't be sorry.

01:26:55.633 --> 01:26:57.032
A little less so.

01:26:57.034 --> 01:26:58.836
I'm sorry I hit you.

01:27:00.972 --> 01:27:02.772
Live and learn, Wolf.

01:27:02.774 --> 01:27:05.975
I'm in love with her.

01:27:05.977 --> 01:27:08.010
I don't think
she cares about me.

01:27:08.012 --> 01:27:10.880
It's all good.

01:27:10.882 --> 01:27:12.748
- Let's get out of here.
- No, no, no.

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:14.884
Yeah.

01:27:14.886 --> 01:27:16.451
Fix it with her
when you get home.

01:27:18.055 --> 01:27:19.387
Casper?

01:27:20.258 --> 01:27:22.625
Casper, come in, goddammit.
Casper?

01:27:22.627 --> 01:27:23.692
Shit. Okay.

01:27:23.694 --> 01:27:24.860
Nothing touches him.

01:27:24.862 --> 01:27:26.128
Come on, Sunny.

01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:27.696
Get up!

01:27:57.562 --> 01:27:58.596
Move back!

01:28:20.685 --> 01:28:21.951
I'm running low on ammo.

01:28:23.554 --> 01:28:25.921
No, you're not.

01:28:25.923 --> 01:28:27.890
My man, Scorp.

01:28:27.892 --> 01:28:29.859
Always coming through.

01:28:32.663 --> 01:28:34.964
All right.

01:28:34.966 --> 01:28:36.531
I'm covering you.

01:28:36.533 --> 01:28:39.735
Now, go.

01:28:39.737 --> 01:28:41.570
Get to the extraction point.

01:28:41.572 --> 01:28:42.972
Five Mikes.

01:28:42.974 --> 01:28:44.740
Go.

01:28:56.821 --> 01:28:58.455
- Rusty.
- Lucas.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.525
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

01:29:04.527 --> 01:29:06.731
- You look like shit.
- So do you.

01:29:07.798 --> 01:29:10.566
I'm gonna give you an EpiPen.

01:29:10.568 --> 01:29:11.869
Hold on.

01:29:20.543 --> 01:29:21.877
Your intel?

01:29:24.015 --> 01:29:26.514
You like that?

01:29:26.516 --> 01:29:27.549
You got your intel?

01:29:27.551 --> 01:29:28.851
Yeah.

01:29:28.853 --> 01:29:31.155
How about that?
We're at a hundred percent.

01:29:34.125 --> 01:29:35.626
How do you like them apples?

01:29:37.662 --> 01:29:39.494
Good job.

01:29:39.496 --> 01:29:40.497
Little Mann and Rooster?

01:29:42.667 --> 01:29:43.768
Expired.

01:29:48.773 --> 01:29:49.772
All right.

01:29:49.774 --> 01:29:50.973
How bad are you?

01:29:50.975 --> 01:29:52.507
What are you talking about?

01:29:52.509 --> 01:29:54.544
- Frogmen don't die.
- All right.

01:29:55.713 --> 01:29:58.515
You keep those
and catch up with Sunny

01:29:59.583 --> 01:30:02.119
and the unit boy
at extraction point.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.687
Delta boy made it?

01:30:04.689 --> 01:30:05.854
Yeah.

01:30:05.856 --> 01:30:08.223
Yeah, right on.

01:30:08.225 --> 01:30:09.459
All right.

01:30:10.227 --> 01:30:12.294
So get your ass up there.

01:30:12.296 --> 01:30:14.964
And let me give Casper
some support.

01:30:14.966 --> 01:30:16.567
All right?

01:30:17.935 --> 01:30:19.201
Casper,
I'm coming in for support.

01:30:27.845 --> 01:30:29.578
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.914
- Get out of here, Wolf.
- Not without you.

01:30:38.055 --> 01:30:40.923
- Now go.
- What are you doing?

01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:45.162
That's an order,!
Now go!

01:31:02.213 --> 01:31:03.278
Sunny, you okay?

01:31:10.955 --> 01:31:13.055
What are you doing?

01:31:13.057 --> 01:31:14.859
I'm getting out of this shit.

01:31:15.893 --> 01:31:18.360
Here, LT.

01:31:18.362 --> 01:31:19.663
Let's get this on you.

01:31:20.898 --> 01:31:23.198
- No. No, you need that.
- Yes.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.767
No, no, no. You need it.

01:31:24.769 --> 01:31:25.970
Sunny, you need this.

01:31:27.104 --> 01:31:29.073
I know where I'm going.
You put this on.

01:31:32.009 --> 01:31:34.143
You're going home.

01:31:34.145 --> 01:31:36.280
So are you. So are you, Sunny.

01:31:38.749 --> 01:31:40.284
You're coming too.

01:31:41.252 --> 01:31:42.920
I'll be there.

01:31:45.389 --> 01:31:47.623
Okay.

01:31:47.625 --> 01:31:52.194
LT, when you hear that chopper,
you get on it.

01:31:52.196 --> 01:31:54.029
That's your ride home.

01:31:56.901 --> 01:31:59.570
You think
we're going to make it?

01:32:02.173 --> 01:32:03.874
Have some faith.

01:32:15.719 --> 01:32:17.052
Sunny.

01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:26.330
Sun?

01:32:28.299 --> 01:32:30.199
Sunny.

01:32:30.201 --> 01:32:31.733
Hey.

01:32:31.735 --> 01:32:34.002
Hey, you don't have
my permission to leave me,

01:32:34.004 --> 01:32:35.904
you hear?

01:32:35.906 --> 01:32:37.274
You hear me?

01:32:38.375 --> 01:32:40.010
That chopper is coming.

01:32:41.078 --> 01:32:42.144
You told me to have faith.

01:32:42.146 --> 01:32:44.215
That chopper's coming,
and you're getting on it.

01:32:48.419 --> 01:32:49.887
Come on, Sunny.

01:32:51.789 --> 01:32:53.090
Don't leave me.

01:32:54.692 --> 01:32:56.458
Come on.

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.426
Sunny.

01:32:57.428 --> 01:32:58.762
Come on.

01:33:00.431 --> 01:33:01.765
Come on.

01:33:05.169 --> 01:33:07.004
Sunny!

01:33:23.988 --> 01:33:25.389
I got you, big guy.

01:33:27.324 --> 01:33:29.024
God is radical.

01:33:29.026 --> 01:33:30.327
Yeah, he is.

01:33:32.296 --> 01:33:35.130
Here you go.

01:33:35.132 --> 01:33:36.832
You hold onto it.

01:33:36.834 --> 01:33:39.136
You gotta go, Wolf.
The bird's coming.

01:33:41.238 --> 01:33:43.105
You stubborn son of a bitch.

01:33:43.107 --> 01:33:45.142
You're not gonna do this to me.

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:48.946
One is none. Two is one.

01:33:53.417 --> 01:33:54.952
Come on, man.

01:34:28.519 --> 01:34:30.354
We're going home, you hear me?

01:34:35.292 --> 01:34:37.526
Sunny, come back!

01:34:37.528 --> 01:34:39.230
Hang on!

01:34:46.237 --> 01:34:48.470
I waited for you, Rusty.

01:34:48.472 --> 01:34:50.806
I waited for you
like I said I would.

01:34:50.808 --> 01:34:52.074
But it's okay.

01:34:52.076 --> 01:34:53.310
Your secret's safe with me.

01:34:54.812 --> 01:34:57.114
- What secret?
- You know.

01:34:58.983 --> 01:35:00.115
Who are you?

01:35:00.117 --> 01:35:01.950
You got old, Rusty.

01:35:01.952 --> 01:35:03.452
No pun intended.

01:35:03.454 --> 01:35:05.756
You never came back to say
goodbye like you promised.

01:35:07.191 --> 01:35:08.890
But it's okay.

01:35:08.892 --> 01:35:11.395
I know you were scared.
I was, too.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.268
Ryan?

01:35:18.235 --> 01:35:21.238
Rusty, Shmusty, Gusty.

01:35:24.041 --> 01:35:25.276
Ryan.

01:35:26.611 --> 01:35:28.012
Took you long enough.

01:35:29.246 --> 01:35:30.514
You were my best friend.

01:35:32.082 --> 01:35:33.982
We were soulmates.

01:35:33.984 --> 01:35:36.251
You always were a silly boy.

01:35:36.253 --> 01:35:37.855
You had me at goodbye.

01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:42.860
Can I ask how long it's been?

01:35:45.963 --> 01:35:46.997
You don't know?

01:35:54.204 --> 01:35:56.038
It's been about 30 years.

01:35:58.442 --> 01:36:00.576
Doesn't seem like it, huh?

01:36:00.578 --> 01:36:03.879
Guess that's why they say,
"Where does time fly?"

01:36:03.881 --> 01:36:05.981
None of them were easy.

01:36:05.983 --> 01:36:07.983
You didn't miss much.

01:36:07.985 --> 01:36:09.918
I missed you.

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.322
I missed you, Rusty.

01:36:16.427 --> 01:36:18.228
Is there anything I can do?

01:36:20.097 --> 01:36:21.263
You can free yourself
of the weight

01:36:21.265 --> 01:36:25.167
you've carried your whole life
for not coming to see me.

01:36:25.169 --> 01:36:27.304
- What do I do?
- It's easy.

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.009
You're the one that's been
watching me my whole life.

01:36:44.121 --> 01:36:45.987
What happens
when I cross that line?

01:36:45.989 --> 01:36:48.158
Everything and nothing.

01:36:51.696 --> 01:36:55.199
I must look like the saddest
little girl in the entire world.

01:37:09.681 --> 01:37:11.616
Hi, Ryan.

01:37:12.617 --> 01:37:15.951
Rusty, Gusty, Shmusty.

01:38:42.372 --> 01:38:43.240
Hey.

01:38:50.214 --> 01:38:53.148
Mommy, I saw Daddy.

01:38:53.150 --> 01:38:56.719
Olivia, baby,
what are you talking about?

01:38:56.721 --> 01:38:58.754
Mommy, I promise I saw him.

01:38:58.756 --> 01:39:01.791
He was
with a white beautiful angel.

01:39:01.793 --> 01:39:04.294
She was carrying another man.

01:39:05.429 --> 01:39:08.430
Olivia, sweetie,

01:39:08.432 --> 01:39:09.464
you're being silly, okay?

01:39:09.466 --> 01:39:11.034
We don't joke about this.

01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:15.738
But I'm not kidding.

01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:17.673
Baby,

01:39:17.675 --> 01:39:20.612
you understand
that Daddy's at work, right?

01:39:21.579 --> 01:39:22.745
Yeah?

01:39:22.747 --> 01:39:26.651
And that means that he's
just in a different country.

01:39:28.218 --> 01:39:29.484
No, he's right outside.

01:39:29.486 --> 01:39:31.520
Honey, all right?
We can't joke about this.

01:39:31.522 --> 01:39:34.690
I'm not joking.
I'm serious. He's outside.

01:39:34.692 --> 01:39:37.259
I think you're just tired.

01:39:37.261 --> 01:39:38.630
Let's go to bed.

01:39:41.633 --> 01:39:42.598
- Let's go.
- No.

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.498
Go.

01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:48.438
See? See?
It's Daddy, Mommy. I heard him.

01:40:01.318 --> 01:40:02.687
Who's there?

01:40:06.858 --> 01:40:08.560
Stay right there, okay?

01:40:10.294 --> 01:40:12.095
Excuse me.

01:40:14.131 --> 01:40:15.600
Are you okay?

01:40:21.171 --> 01:40:22.772
Baby, stay.

01:40:22.774 --> 01:40:24.308
Vanessa.

01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:27.544
Vanessa.

01:40:28.746 --> 01:40:30.312
Rusty?

01:40:30.314 --> 01:40:31.847
Vanessa.

01:40:56.708 --> 01:40:58.275
Rusty.
