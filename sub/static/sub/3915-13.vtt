<i>NARRATOR: Previously on
Beauty & the Beast:</i>

00:03.920 --> 00:05.160
- Holy crap.
- What? What is it?

00:05.320 --> 00:08.483
Liam's not Helen Ellingsworth's
brother. He's her ancestor.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.371
Look. That's who Rebecca
was engaged to before Alistair.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.410
Liam is the beast from 1854.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.211
I can sense revenge.
It certainly drives the guy.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.330
Because Rebecca rejected him
all those decades ago?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.562
You should know we're opening
a review of your record,

00:22.720 --> 00:24.722
going back over
the last three to four years.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.405
Which is exactly what Liam wants.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.130
- I'm sorry?
- He's the bad guy here.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.770
He is playing everybody.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.365
L.A. and now this?

00:31.520 --> 00:33.602
He is doing everything he can
to destroy everything

00:33.760 --> 00:36.650
that we've worked so hard to get.
We just gotta figure out what he wants.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.689
He wants you, Vincent.
That's what he wants.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.844
For whatever reason, he wants you.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.810
- Okay. Wait.
- Wait, wait. Okay, slow down.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.644
Was that from last year
or the year before?

00:46.800 --> 00:49.929
No, I'm still on the ones
from when Vincent and I first met.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.811
There were the first Muirfield thugs,
Agent Cole, the bike messenger--

00:52.960 --> 00:54.246
- A hit man.
- Then Hollingsworth,

00:54.400 --> 00:55.731
the guy who tried to kill Evan.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.928
Sheckman's thug,
who tried to kill me in the alleyway.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.560
I still think I'm missing a few
from Vincent's vigilante days.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.291
- Still, that's a lot.
- They were bad people, Heather.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.284
- They tried to kill us.
- No, I know. I'm just saying.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.091
It's a lot of people.
We're not even on year two yet.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.571
I had no idea.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.370
Well, Liam clearly has an idea.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.286
Otherwise why would he try to expose
Vincent by tipping off the police?

01:16.440 --> 01:19.284
Wait, so you think that Liam's trying
to expose Vincent as a beast?

01:19.440 --> 01:21.647
It is the worst thing
that could happen to us, right?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.371
I really think that Liam's
trying to get revenge on us

01:24.520 --> 01:26.921
because we wouldn't let him get
revenge on the Ellingsworihs.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.560
He's not confusing you two
for Rebecca and Alistair anymore?

01:29.720 --> 01:33.520
No, but he would love nothing more
than to have history repeat itself.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.808
What, by trying to kill you
like he killed Rebecca?

01:35.960 --> 01:39.009
I don't think so. First of all,

01:39.160 --> 01:40.207
I have pepper spray.-

01:40.360 --> 01:44.490
And secondly, Rebecca did not have a
little sister to help save her and you do.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.165
Hmm.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.724
Hey. Any idea
what Liam's next move is?

01:49.880 --> 01:51.450
We were just working on it. Why?

01:51.600 --> 01:54.251
Well, I just got a call from one
of the nurses at the hospital,

01:54.400 --> 01:57.085
saying detectives have been
there asking questions about me,

01:57.240 --> 01:59.891
about whether anyone there knew rne
from before.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.927
Before what?

02:02.080 --> 02:04.481
Before I lied about all the killings
and got reinstated.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.086
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.764
Yeah.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.443
Damn it!

02:15.120 --> 02:18.010
- I'm sorry but I have to go after him.
- We have got to do this together.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.924
If we haven't learned anything
else this year.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.526
He's backing me into a corner, okay?
He's gonna expose us.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.480
He is trying to distract us from figuring
out how to stop him, which we will.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.281
J.T. is trying to extract the superhuman
properties from Liam's blood.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.886
- If we can inject that into you--
- It's too late.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.045
Those vigilante cases, he is pointing
the police directly at me, okay?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.487
It's just a matter of time
before they connect the dots.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.371
This is exactly what he wants.
He wants you to panic and pick a fight

02:42.520 --> 02:44.966
because he knows
that we don't know how to stop him.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.122
Vincent, he is just trying to bait you.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.966
I know.
But I cannot let him expose us.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.203
You know, I can lose my job,
my freedom, even my life,

02:54.360 --> 02:59.002
but if the world finds out
exactly what it is that I am,

02:59.160 --> 03:03.290
you're the one who's gonna suffer.
Not me.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.363
- And I won't let that happen.
- Wait. Just please.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.851
Go to J.T. first.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.843
See if he can help you with Liam

03:11.000 --> 03:13.287
and I'll try and buy us
some more time, talk to Tess,

03:13.440 --> 03:17.047
see if we can figure out which bodies
Liam's planning to dredge up next.

[MAN SCREAMS]

03:57.920 --> 04:01.447
Look, if you ask me, chief, it's like
pulling a fire alarm when there is no fire.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.443
Yeah. I'm aware Detective Chandler
was the lead

04:03.600 --> 04:06.570
on some of the open homicides, but if
she was trying to cover something up,

04:06.720 --> 04:08.131
I would've known.
I was her partner.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.691
Don't implicate yourself.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.842
I'm gonna need more
time with the files, all right?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.525
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.445
Now, even the Commissioner's Office
is looking into the cases.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.045
God forbid the feds get involved.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.487
But so far, Liam's only tipping
the higher-ups to cases

04:20.640 --> 04:23.689
that happened before you knew about
Vincent, so you can't be exposed.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.683
Yes, I can. Cat. Come on.
From what I've seen,

04:25.840 --> 04:28.525
Liam's going chronological
with all these beast-related cases,

04:28.680 --> 04:30.808
so, sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up to me too.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.931
I know. So let's figure out which case
Liam's planning to expose next,

04:35.080 --> 04:38.129
see if we can divert it so it doesn't
come back to you or anybody else.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.169
Yeah, especially J.T.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.365
Look, worst case scenario, I could
lose my job for covering this up.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.000
But J.T.? He's the one who kept
Vincent hidden all these years,

04:46.160 --> 04:49.960
covered his tracks. He lied to police,
hacked files, stole cadavers.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.681
If anybody looks at the big picture,
J.T.'s screwed, he'll go to prison.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.649
I don't want to lose him.
I just got him back.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.802
Okay, we're not gonna let that happen.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.804
Honestly, Cat, next to Vincent,
if this thing blows up,

05:00.960 --> 05:03.201
you're the one with the most to lose.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.489
Aiding and abetting a fricking beast?
You'd be lucky if all you got was prison.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.530
Yeah, well, it hasn't blown up yet
and I'm not going down without a fight.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.967
Oh, yeah?
How are you gonna stop him?

05:12.120 --> 05:16.444
I don't know. But I don't think
that the answer is necessarily force.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.807
I keep thinking that
there's got to be a way to appeal

05:18.960 --> 05:21.247
to who Liam was
before he crossed the primal line.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.846
But I thought you said
once beasts cross the primal line--

05:24.000 --> 05:27.607
There's no turning back, I know.
But what if there is a way?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.762
I mean, Liam, he keeps talking
about his suffering,

05:29.920 --> 05:31.809
about wanting his victims to suffer too.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.725
What if we could remind him
of who he was before the suffering,

05:34.880 --> 05:36.803
before he lost love?

05:37.720 --> 05:40.246
Oh, so just remind him
of the human he used to be,

05:40.400 --> 05:42.482
instead of the beast he became?

05:43.440 --> 05:46.444
Something like that. Yes.
What, does that sound crazy?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.364
No, not at all.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.682
<i>J.T.: That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.</i>

05:50.840 --> 05:53.650
You can't go up against Liam
by yourself.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.690
Not yet, anyway. Otherwise,
what am I trying to do here?

05:56.840 --> 06:00.367
Okay, all I'm saying is that the last
two times that we fought, right,

06:00.520 --> 06:01.681
it ended in a draw.

06:01.840 --> 06:05.481
- Because both fights got cut short.
- Right. Right,

06:05.640 --> 06:09.690
- so maybe, maybe I can defeat him.
- Or maybe you could die.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.207
Vincent, listen to me.
I think I'm close.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.600
I'm already healed, right?

06:13.760 --> 06:16.127
Thanks to Liam's blood,
I'm not dying anymore,

06:16.280 --> 06:19.727
which means if I can get you the same
enhanced power Julianna gave him--

06:19.880 --> 06:21.291
Dude.
We are running out of time.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.408
He is this close to exposing me,

06:23.560 --> 06:25.767
which means he's that close
to exposing you too.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.366
Which mean
this isn't just about you, is it?

06:28.520 --> 06:32.161
So don't think you can go
all rogue cowboy and do it by yourself

06:32.320 --> 06:35.210
- because you can't.
- Okay.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.523
- Way to boost my confidence.
- Sorry.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.648

had to give it to you straight.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.691
I know. But you don't have him
constantly whispering in your ear.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.561
From nowhere, all day.
He's close, man.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.690
He's close and he's watching
and he's goading me.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.286
- Okay.
- Maybe you should just inject me

06:54.440 --> 06:56.204
with the self-healing stuff, you know?

06:56.360 --> 06:58.567
At least that way
I'll have an edge if I get injured.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.845
try to frame you last year too?

11:18.880 --> 11:21.486
- Yes.
- Who your fiancée then killed.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.802
It was self-defence.
He was trying to kill her.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.564
For framing you.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.087
And now, here you are,
being framed again.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.925
- Yes.
- So this is one big misunderstanding?

11:32.080 --> 11:34.651
You got nothing to do with these
cases, that what you're saying?

11:34.800 --> 11:38.009
All right, look, Vincent,
may I call you Vincent?

11:38.160 --> 11:40.003
I know your fiancée,
Detective Chandler.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.925
She returned a case to us
that she was never supposed to get.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.730
But you knew that already, right?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.246
This is a federal domestic terrorism
case now, do you understand?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.528
Our job is to protect the homeland.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.523
You look like you may well
be a threat to it.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.241
Which means, either you explain your
involvement in these suspicious deaths,

12:01.400 --> 12:03.607

or we'll bring your fiancée

12:03.760 --> 12:05.524

who might be connected in.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.843
Is that what you want? ls it?

12:10.360 --> 12:14.570
If you're gonna send detectives into my
jurisdiction to arrest somebody, at lea--

12:14.720 --> 12:16.563
The Commissioner's Office
told you not to tell me?

12:16.720 --> 12:19.451
- What the hell does that-J?
- Detective Chandler on line five.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.843
Okay. Look, never mind that,
just tell me, are you charging J.T.,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.243
Professor Forbes, with anything or are
you just squeezing him for information?

12:26.400 --> 12:29.449
Hello? Captain?

12:29.600 --> 12:31.841
Crap. Hey.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.810
I hope you're having better luck
with Vincent than I'm having with J.T.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.248
No. All I got was one damn courtesy call
from DHS saying he's been arrested.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.563
- I'm heading there now.
- Liam totally set him up using Windsor.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.007
- Making him look even more guilty.
VINCENT: Cat.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.808
Vincent. I'll call you back.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.403
Thank God. Are you all right?

12:53.560 --> 12:56.962
Yeah. For another 24 hours, maybe.

12:57.120 --> 13:01.409
Look, DHS don't have enough to
charge me with yet, but they will, okay?

13:01.560 --> 13:05.246
They've given me the day to figure out
if we want to come clean or not.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.289
And if we don't?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.526
Well, full investigation,
grand jury indictment,

13:10.680 --> 13:13.923
prison at best, exposure at worst.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.885
It's not just me they're looking at.
They want to connect all of us.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.405
I'm so sorry.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.289
Come on.
What's going on with J.T.?

13:21.440 --> 13:24.922
CATHERINE: He's still at the 95th.
Tess can't even get to him.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.402
Look, you're not gonna like this, okay?
But please just hear me out.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.130
The one thing that Liam is banking on,

13:30.280 --> 13:32.089
the one piece of leverage
he thinks he's got,

13:32.240 --> 13:35.369
is thinking that we would
never tell the truth, right?

13:35.520 --> 13:36.885
- Right, but--
- Right, okay,

13:37.040 --> 13:41.364
so what if we tell Russo what Liam's
thinking we would never tell?

13:41.520 --> 13:44.569
- That you're a beast?
- Yes. Yes. Okay? Why not?

13:44.720 --> 13:47.246
Why not?
Are you, are you kidding me?

13:47.400 --> 13:49.607
What do you think
they're gonna do, forgive you? Us?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.603
Pretend like none of those cases
ever happened?

13:51.760 --> 13:54.525
- No, they're gonna crucify you.
- Well, they're gonna do that anyway.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.284
You know? Whether we like it or not.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.727
At least, this way,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.245
We've already talked about this.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.402
How can we trust anybody,
especially the feds,

14:02.560 --> 14:04.085
considering what they did to you?

14:04.240 --> 14:05.890
Okay, well,
what's the alternative?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.646
Let Liam keep digging up these bodies
to expose me to the world?

14:08.800 --> 14:13.840
Then it won't just be me who's crucified,
it'll be you, your sister, Tess, J.T.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.608
You know? All of us, we will be screwed
and I just, I cannot let that happen.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.207
Okay, so even if we do tell Russo
and even if he doesn't turn on us,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.408
our lives will never be the same.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.085
Somebody's gonna know our secret

14:26.240 --> 14:28.368
and who knows
what he's gonna do with that.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.761
Okay, yes, I know,
but if Russo knows who I am,

14:30.920 --> 14:32.729
then he's gonna find out
who Liam is, as well.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.410
Okay? And then maybe he's willing
to team up with us to stop him.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.562
But what about after?
How do you know our lives

14:38.720 --> 14:41.041

to where they started three years ago,

14:41.200 --> 14:44.170

nowhere near our happily ever after?

14:44.320 --> 14:47.369
I know, I know,
it is a huge risk either way.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.809
Look, if the one thing you
keep telling me is that

14:53.960 --> 14:59.126
if we just have faith in us, if we stick
together, then everything will be okay.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.484

15:05.200 --> 15:07.407
Oh, God.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.602
I don't like it. Why didn't Keller
want to meet us at DHS?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.603
Neutral territory?
Maybe he doesn't trust us.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.445
Trust us? He's the one who should
be worrying about us trusting him.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.329
There's no good explanation
for any of this.

to meet. Let's just hear him out.

the very government that you work for.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.045

he risked everything-

that you're responsible?

for most of those cases.

and start looking at who was killed

Vincent by feeding you these cases.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.087

we just risked it all is in the hope

16:42.240 --> 16:45.687
that you would stop chasing me and
start chasing the real threat, Liam.

you said killed Julianna Keaton?

that he's succeeded.

expose rne completely to the world

from the things you've done?

17:34.840 --> 17:36.922
- It was all for the greater good.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.208

were handled outside the law,

36:34.280 --> 36:37.124
- Hey, why not?
- Why not what?

36:37.280 --> 36:39.886
- Why not get married?
- We're going to.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.724
No, I mean now. Tonight.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.604
What? Don't get crazy,
you have to plan weddings, J.T.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.524
- Do you? The last one was planned
- Yeah.

36:47.680 --> 36:52.811
- And that didn't turn out so well.
- That was not my fault.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.724
No, but wait, he has a point though,
why wait?

36:54.880 --> 36:58.407
I mean, God knows what could
happen, especially with you two.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.882
- I guess.
- Who's gonna marry us?

37:04.040 --> 37:07.487
- She's a police captain.
- That doesn't count.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.405
You could get her ordained online,
my best friend's dad did it.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.444
Uh...

37:18.240 --> 37:20.288
- Okay.
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.566
Yay!

37:55.440 --> 37:56.965
You look amazing.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.642
Okay, guys,
so we are gathered here

38:03.800 --> 38:05.723
to witness the coming together
between two people

38:05.880 --> 38:08.247
- You look beautiful.
- whose heads and spirits

38:08.400 --> 38:11.051
are absolutely entwined as one.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.010
I love you for everything
that you are

38:14.160 --> 38:16.970
and everything that you make me
when I am with you.

38:17.120 --> 38:21.409
You are my partner in life
and my one true love.

38:21.560 --> 38:25.406
You are my partner in life
and you are my one true love

38:25.560 --> 38:27.722
and I will cherish
this marriage always

38:27.880 --> 38:29.769
and I will love you more
and more every day.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.728
Do you, Vincent Keller,
take Catherine Chandler

38:34.880 --> 38:39.727
to be your lawfully wedded wife,
to love, honour, cherish and protect?

38:39.880 --> 38:40.881
I do.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.041
[CHUCKLES]

38:42.400 --> 38:44.323
Do you, Catherine Chandler,
take Vincent Keller

38:44.480 --> 38:49.088

to love, honour, cherish and protect?

38:49.240 --> 38:50.765

38:53.560 --> 38:55.767
- Ring.
- Oh. Rings.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.843
- Ladies first.
- Okay.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.881
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

39:05.040 --> 39:07.327
sickness and health,

39:07.480 --> 39:09.403
till death do us part.

39:13.360 --> 39:17.843
I promise to be your constant friend,
your faithful partner

39:18.000 --> 39:21.641
and your love from this day forward.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.850

39:25.320 --> 39:27.971
Okay, by the power
just now vested in me,

39:28.120 --> 39:30.088
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.407

- Okay.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.490
