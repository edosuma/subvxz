00:36.637 --> 00:38.139
>> I ALWAYS FEEL SLIGHTLY

00:38.139 --> 00:42.910
DEPRESSED BY BEAUTIFUL VISTAS,

00:42.910 --> 00:49.317
YOU KNOW I MEAN?

00:55.523 --> 01:36.564
*

01:36.564 --> 01:40.501
>>> AH, THE STORYBOOK KINGDOM OF

01:40.501 --> 01:40.801
GRENADA.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.504
ONE OF THE OLDEST, MOST COMPLEX,

01:43.504 --> 01:44.905
MAGICALLY SURREAL PLACES IN

01:44.905 --> 01:45.173
SPAIN.

01:45.173 --> 01:49.009
AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.911
GRENADA IS TUCKED AGAINST THE

01:50.911 --> 01:52.813
SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS OF

01:52.813 --> 01:56.684
ANDALUCIA IN SOUTHERN SPAIN.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.651
IT'S NOT LIKE BARCELONA.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.688
IT AIN'T MADRID.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.223
ANY REASONABLE PERSON WHO LOOKS

02:02.223 --> 02:04.091
AT SPAIN, COMES TO SPAIN, EATS

02:04.091 --> 02:05.993
IN SPAIN, DRINKS IN SPAIN,

02:05.993 --> 02:08.395
THEY'RE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.163
OTHERWISE, THERE'S SOMETHING

02:09.163 --> 02:11.932
DEEPLY WRONG WITH YOU.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.867
SPAIN IS THE SORT OF PLACE THAT

02:13.867 --> 02:15.503
NEVER REALLY MADE ANY SENSE

02:15.503 --> 02:15.869
ANYWAY.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.037
BUT IN THE VERY BEST POSSIBLE

02:17.037 --> 02:20.274
WAY.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.675
THIS IS THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE US

02:21.675 --> 02:23.244
THE SPANISH INQUISITION.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.912
ALSO ANARCHY.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.182
THIS IS WHERE DEVOUT CATHOLICISM

02:28.182 --> 02:33.387
MIXES WITH SURREALISM, MODERNIST

02:33.387 --> 02:34.455
CUISINE.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.956
CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM SPARED

02:35.956 --> 02:36.190
SPACE.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.192
THE EFFECTS OF INFLUENCES OF ALL

02:38.192 --> 02:39.460
THOSE THINGS ARE RIGHT HERE TO

02:39.460 --> 02:44.131
SEE.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.300
YOU CAN ALMOST LOOK BACK THROUGH

02:46.300 --> 02:51.104
TIME AND SEE THE VENETIANS

02:51.104 --> 02:57.778
MARCHING UP.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.580
OR ARE THOSE FERAL HIPPIES?

02:59.580 --> 03:05.753
MANY OF THEM MADE THINGS

03:05.753 --> 03:06.053
INTERESTING.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.154
WHEREVER YOU ARE ON THE

03:07.154 --> 03:08.322
IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, SOME

03:08.322 --> 03:12.593
THINGS ARE CONSTANT, IT SEEMS.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.162
SOME STEREOTYPICAL EXPECTATIONS.

03:15.162 --> 03:21.802
IT'S TRUE, THERE ARE FREE TAPAS

03:21.802 --> 03:23.103
EVERYWHERE.

03:23.103 --> 03:23.637
FLAMEN

03:23.637 --> 03:24.405
FLAMENCO, YES, THEY DO THAT

03:24.405 --> 03:24.605
ALSO.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.340
BUT IN GRANADA, THEY DO IT OLD

03:26.340 --> 03:26.640
SCHOOL.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.742
AND OH YEAH, BULLFIGHTING.

03:28.742 --> 03:35.283
THEY DO THAT HERE, TOO.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.085
BUT I DIGRESS.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.420
I'M HERE TO ANSWER A QUESTION.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.654
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GO OVER TO

03:40.654 --> 03:41.689
THE OTHER SIDE?

03:41.689 --> 03:42.856
SAY YOU GREW UP IN THE STATES

03:42.856 --> 03:44.958
AND WONDERED, FANTASIZED ABOUT

03:44.958 --> 03:46.327
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING

03:46.327 --> 03:48.262
ABROAD IN OLD EUROPE, SURROUNDED

03:48.262 --> 03:51.365
BY CRUSADER CASTLES, DELICIOUS

03:51.365 --> 03:53.767
FOOD, ANOTHER LANGUAGE, ANOTHER

03:53.767 --> 03:54.001
CULTURE?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.636
WHAT WOULD THAT ALTERNATE LIFE,

03:55.636 --> 04:00.007
THAT ROAD NOT TAKEN BE LIKE?

04:00.007 --> 04:03.777
MY LONGTIME FRIEND AND CAMERAMAN

04:03.777 --> 04:06.714
FROM MAINE ZACK IS FINDING OUT.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.881
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING?

04:07.881 --> 04:10.618
>> RIGHT HERE, ONE OF THESE

04:10.618 --> 04:10.851
TABLES.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.154
MAYBE WE WANT TO DO THIS WITH.

04:14.154 --> 04:14.955
SEE?

04:14.955 --> 04:17.625
HOW OFTEN CAN YOU GO OUT WITH

04:17.625 --> 04:20.060
SOMEBODY WHO CAN APPROPRIATELY

04:20.060 --> 04:21.060
BLOCK THE TABLE?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.397
>> AY, YES, OF COURSE.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.832
SNAILS IN AN ALMOND SAUCE.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.467
ABOUT AS TRADITIONAL AND

04:26.467 --> 04:33.173
DELICIOUS AS IT GETS.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.542
TAPAS COME FROM HERE.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.143
THIS IS STILL ONE OF THE FEW

04:36.143 --> 04:38.178
PLACES IN SPAIN WHERE THEY'RE

04:38.178 --> 04:38.412
FREE.

04:38.412 --> 04:42.249
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP

04:42.249 --> 04:42.550
DRINKING.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.718
>> YOU CAN SIT HERE ALL DAY.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.886
ORDER A COUPLE DRINKS.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.187
>> NO RUSH.

04:47.187 --> 04:52.526
I'M GLAD I'M SPENDING SOME TIME

04:52.526 --> 04:53.694
HERE.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.094
RED WINE ORDERED.

04:54.094 --> 04:54.462
TRIPE TO FOLLOW.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.997
SPENDER, SPICY, DELICIOUS TRIPE.

04:56.997 --> 04:57.765
>> GUTS.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.099
PRETTY GOOD.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.602
>> HELLO.

05:01.602 --> 05:01.835
HELLO.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.937
>> NOT TOO LONG AGO, BEFORE ZACK

05:03.937 --> 05:08.442
BASICALLY DEFECTED TO SPAIN, HE

05:08.442 --> 05:10.043
MET FUEN.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.278
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE'S

05:11.278 --> 05:12.112
LIVING HERE.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.282
PART OF AN EXTENDED ANDALUCIAN

05:15.282 --> 05:15.616
FAMILY.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.518
LIVING THE LIFE OF THE SPANISH

05:17.518 --> 05:17.718
DANDY.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.953
IN FREAKING GRANADA, NO LESS.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.889
>> CLASSICALLY, CULTURALLY

05:21.889 --> 05:23.190
SPEAKING, DO YOU WANT A

05:23.190 --> 05:24.692
SENSITIVE, NICE, CARING

05:24.692 --> 05:25.125
THOUGHTFUL GUY?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.928
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS ON THE

05:27.928 --> 05:28.596
WOMAN, FIRST.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.564
BUT USUALLY WE LOOK FOR THIS

05:30.564 --> 05:32.766
KIND OF PERSON THAT WE KNOW HE

05:32.766 --> 05:37.104
WILL PROTECT US.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.573
>> FROM WHAT?

05:39.573 --> 05:40.741
FERAL HIPPIES?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.576
>> I WOULD LIKE TO DO THE VOWS

05:42.576 --> 05:44.478
OF YOUR WEDDING.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.815
DO YOU SWEAR TO PROTECT FUEN

05:47.815 --> 05:50.384
SANCHEZ ATTACKS BY CAVE-DWELLING

05:50.384 --> 05:50.618
HIPPIES?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.920
WHO ATTEMPT TO SELL HER JEWELRY

05:52.920 --> 05:57.324
OR OTHER THINGS OF LITTLE VALUE.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.292
>> I FIGURE NOW THAT ZACK IS

05:59.292 --> 06:00.828
MARRYING INTO A SPANISH FAMILY,

06:00.828 --> 06:04.632
I CAN PIGGY BACK ALONG, SUCK OF

06:04.632 --> 06:06.967
THE LURE OF THE MAGIC, LIVE ON

06:06.967 --> 06:08.335
WHAT HAS BEEN MY DREAM, TOO.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.737
>> IF WE CAN GET WEIRD FOR A

06:09.737 --> 06:13.006
SECOND HERE, MAN.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.175
SOME PLACES, DO THEY HAVE AN

06:15.175 --> 06:16.176
ENERGY, MAN, ABOUT THEM?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.745
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

06:17.745 --> 06:21.014
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO GET

06:21.014 --> 06:24.418
INTO METAPHYSICS.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.819
>> YOU ARE GOING TO END UP

06:25.819 --> 06:28.021
LIVING IN A CAVE IF YOU KEEP

06:28.021 --> 06:32.025
TALKING LIKE THIS.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.827
MORE WINE.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.362
TO SEE SPAIN, TO SEE IT

06:35.362 --> 06:38.131
STRAIGHT, TO UNDERSTAND IT AT

06:38.131 --> 06:40.434
ALL, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PEEK,

06:40.434 --> 06:41.435
IF ONLY THROUGH SPREAD FINGERS,

06:41.435 --> 06:43.537
AT THAT MOST SPANISH OF

06:43.537 --> 06:47.608
TRADITIONS.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.109
BULLFIGHTING.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.712
MEET ALFANDI, ONE OF SPAIN'S

06:51.712 --> 06:53.313
MOST DASHING AND RESPECTED

06:53.313 --> 06:53.647
BULLFIGHTERS.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.550
HE'S INVITED ME TO A RANCH, A

06:56.550 --> 07:01.288
PRIVATE BULL RING WHERE HE LIKES

07:01.288 --> 07:02.523
TO PRACTICE.

07:02.523 --> 07:07.060
>> SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO

07:07.060 --> 07:09.463
NOW IS SEE HOW BRAVE --

07:09.463 --> 07:13.300
>> AND IF THE CALF IS NOT BRAVE,

07:13.300 --> 07:13.534
STEW.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.236
>> AND FUEN'S BROTHER ALEJANDRO,

07:16.236 --> 07:17.538
WHO LIKE MANY SPANIARDS,

07:17.538 --> 07:18.906
CONSIDER BULLFIGHTING AN ART.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.240
TODAY A LITTLE PRACTICE FIRST.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.809
DON'T WORRY, THIS GUY IS TOO

07:21.809 --> 07:41.328
YOUNG TO FIGHT.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.930
>> YOU SEE THE RED CAPE, YOU

07:42.930 --> 07:44.264
KNOW THIS IS THE MOST THING.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.600
WHERE THEY MAKE ALL THE ART, ALL

07:46.600 --> 07:50.203
THE POETRY.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.238
>> WHY THE CAPE?

07:51.238 --> 07:52.506
>> BECAUSE IT'S MOVING.

07:52.506 --> 07:57.210
>> SO THAT'S IMPORTANT?

07:57.210 --> 08:01.715
>> YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE

08:01.715 --> 08:05.753
MOVING AT ALL.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.187
>> THIS GUY CLEARLY HAS SPIRIT.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.623
RIGHT AWAY HE TRIES TO TAKE A

08:09.623 --> 08:15.629
POKE AT ZACK'S FEMORAL ARTERY.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.965
PROMISING.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.432
>> HE'S GOING TO TEACH YOU.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.102
>> NO.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.070
>> SURE.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.373
>> NO ONE LIKES TO LOOK LIKE A

08:26.373 --> 08:29.309
PUSSY ON TV, SO WHEN HE

08:29.309 --> 08:31.945
SUGGESTED I JOIN HIM TO WAVE A

08:31.945 --> 08:36.583
PINK CAPE AT AN AGGRESSIVE YOUNG

08:36.583 --> 08:38.118
BULL, I SAID WHAT ANY IDIOT

08:38.118 --> 08:39.219
WOULD SAY -- SI.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.621
IT ALL STARTS WELL ENOUGH.

08:40.621 --> 08:44.958
HEY, THIS IS FUN.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.995
THIS IS EASY.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.330
UNTIL I GET A HORN HOOKED RIGHT

08:50.330 --> 08:52.332
UP NEXT TO MY NUTSACK.

08:52.332 --> 08:57.671
THEN IT'S NOT SO FUN.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.072
THANKS, GUYS.

08:59.072 --> 09:03.911
THIS YOUNGSTER SHALL LIVE,

09:03.911 --> 09:05.613
PERHAPS TO GORE A FUTURE TV HOST

09:05.613 --> 09:09.116
WITH HIS MIGHTY HORNS.

09:09.116 --> 09:13.987
NOW THIS IS WHAT A REAL BULL

09:13.987 --> 09:16.356
LOOKS LIKE.

09:16.356 --> 09:21.862
THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.664
500-FREAKING-KILOS OF AGGRESSIVE

09:23.664 --> 09:29.536
CHARGING KILLDOZER AIMING AT

09:29.536 --> 09:33.540
YOUR MEAT.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.842
IT'S A LOT OF MUSCLE.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.509
>> YEAH, IT'S A LOT OF MUSCLE.

09:36.509 --> 10:10.878
THAT'S A BIG BULL.

10:11.679 --> 10:17.384
*

10:17.384 --> 10:18.852
>> NO MATTER HOW BIG, HOW

10:18.852 --> 10:21.855
STRONG, HOW SCARY, FOR THIS

10:21.855 --> 10:23.256
INTREPID REPORTER WHO'S SEEN

10:23.256 --> 10:25.192
MANY ANIMALS DIE FOR HIS DINNER,

10:25.192 --> 10:27.360
THIS PART IS NEVER EASY.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.362
>> SO AS YOU SEE, HE PUTS THE

10:29.362 --> 10:30.430
CAPE LOWER.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.766
SO WHEN THE BULL BRINGS THE FACE

10:32.766 --> 10:39.506
FORWARD, SHOWING THE NECK --

10:39.506 --> 10:40.073
THAT'S IT.

10:40.073 --> 10:44.678
THAT WAS VERY GOOD.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.445
THAT'S IT.

10:45.445 --> 10:50.450
>> IT'S TIME FOR STU.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.184
BULL STEW.

10:51.184 --> 10:55.723
OUR FRIEND WENT TO A BETTER

10:55.723 --> 10:56.957
PLACE.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.558
LOCAL HERBS, POE TODAY TOES.

10:58.558 --> 11:03.463
NOTHING LIKE A ROARING FIRE,

11:03.463 --> 11:06.299
SPANISH CHEESES, BREAD, AND GOOD

11:06.299 --> 11:11.138
OLIVE OIL TO TAKE THE STING OUT

11:11.138 --> 11:16.810
OF A NEAR GENITAL MUTILATION.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.246
>> IT'S NOT A BAD PLACE.

11:19.246 --> 11:33.660
>> HE STARTED AT AGE 19?

11:33.660 --> 11:34.962
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY

11:34.962 --> 11:37.798
GROWING UP, YOU ASPIRED TO BE A

11:37.798 --> 11:38.165
MATADOR.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.733
THE MATADORS WERE THE ORIGINAL

11:39.733 --> 11:44.071
ROCK STARS, THE IDEAL OF

11:44.071 --> 11:45.338
MASCULINITY, MALE BEAUTY, AND

11:45.338 --> 11:45.572
GRACE.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.840
THAT RUNS DEEP.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.508
LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU SHOULD

11:48.508 --> 11:49.509
PROBABLY KNOW THIS BEFORE DATING

11:49.509 --> 11:54.347
A SPANISH GUY.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.684
THERE IS NO DENYING THE TERRIBLE

11:57.684 --> 12:01.755
BEAUTY OF THE VERY COMPLEX

12:01.755 --> 12:02.522
TRADITION.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.292
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING.

12:05.292 --> 12:05.959
IT'S NOT ABOUT KILLING THE BULL.

12:05.959 --> 12:10.697
AND NOR IS IT ABOUT BEING JUST

12:10.697 --> 12:10.998
SKILLFUL.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.299
YOU HAVE TO LOOK GOOD DOING IT,

12:12.299 --> 12:12.465
TOO.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.202
ARE THERE ANY UGLY ASS

12:15.202 --> 12:15.535
BULLFIGHTERS?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.370
A REALLY OUT OF SHAPE -- A

12:17.370 --> 12:18.005
MUFFIN TOP.

12:18.005 --> 12:25.678
HOW DO YOU CALL A MUFFIN TOP?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.036
FOR SEVEN DAYS LEADING UP TO

13:23.036 --> 13:24.271
EASTER, NEARLY EVERY CITY IN

13:24.271 --> 13:27.007
ANDALUCIA GETS TAKEN OVER BY

13:27.007 --> 13:28.241
ANCIENT PROCESSIONS.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.377
TO AN OUTSIDER, IT'S AN

13:30.377 --> 13:31.578
IMPENETRABLE MONTAGE OF

13:31.578 --> 13:33.914
CONFUSING, YET DEEPLY EVOCATIVE

13:33.914 --> 13:34.714
IMAGES.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.516
FIGURES IN DARK HOODS LOOM UP

13:36.516 --> 13:39.086
FROM EVERY DIRECTION.

13:39.086 --> 13:42.222
SPOKE POTS OF INSECTS, CANDLES,

13:42.222 --> 13:44.357
RELIGIOUS IMAGERY, AND THE

CUMBERSOME FLOAT THROUGH THE

14:08.882 --> 14:13.753
DOOR, DOWN THE STEPS, AND OUT

14:13.753 --> 14:21.061
INTO THE STREET.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.163
PEDRO IS ANOTHER OF FUEN'S

14:23.163 --> 14:24.664
BROTHERS, THE YOUNGEST, AND WHEN

14:24.664 --> 14:26.566

14:26.566 --> 14:27.901
IN IRELAND, HE DOES THIS.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.270
HE CARRIES CRUSHINGLY HEAVY

14:30.270 --> 14:31.471
RELIGIOUS FLOATS.

14:31.471 --> 14:43.316
THEY'RE CALLED ED CASTELEROS.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.953
THE VIRGIN FLOAT, ABOUT 3,500

14:45.953 --> 14:48.121
POUNDS TOTAL, AND PRECISE

14:48.121 --> 14:49.322
DIMENSIONS THAT HAVE TO MAKE IT

14:49.322 --> 14:50.757

ESTABLISHMENT, WHERE BETWEEN

16:09.869 --> 16:11.571
DRINKS, ONE CAN PONDER THE AGONY

16:11.571 --> 16:15.575
OF CHRIST, BUT WITH SOME SAUSA

16:15.575 --> 16:15.875
SAUSAGES.

16:15.875 --> 16:16.776
IS IT LIKE THIS ALL YEAR?

THIS A PARTY WEEK OR BOTH?

16:28.388 --> 16:29.622
>> BOTH OF THEM.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.857

16:30.857 --> 16:32.792
WEEK, OVER 40-ODD PROCESSIONS

16:32.792 --> 16:35.428
WILL CREEP SLOWLY FROM THESE

16:35.428 --> 16:35.895
STREETS.

16:35.895 --> 16:36.929
THERE ARE DIFFERENT

16:36.929 --> 16:37.797
BROTHERHOODS, EACH WITH THEIR

16:37.797 --> 16:40.733
OWN SACRED COLORS, CRESTS,

16:40.733 --> 16:41.901
INSIGNIA AND SO ON.

IT'S THEIR MEDALLIONS OF

16:43.203 --> 16:44.404
PARTICULAR CHRIST IMAGES THAT

16:44.404 --> 16:45.238

16:45.238 --> 16:46.873
AND FRANKLY, THEY'RE KIND OF

16:46.873 --> 16:47.574
BUMMING ME OUT.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.276
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME, BUT WHEN I'M

16:49.276 --> 16:50.810
GETTING A NICE LATE MORNING

16:50.810 --> 16:52.079
BUZZ, I DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT

HILLSIDE OF SACRAMONTE IS

17:27.480 --> 17:29.249
RIDDLED WITH CAVES, MANY OLDER

17:29.249 --> 17:30.583
THAN ANYONE EVEN REMEMBERS.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.353
SPANISH GYPSIES HAVE LIVED HERE

17:33.353 --> 17:34.954
IN CAVES TURNED HOMES LIKE THIS

FLAMENCO IN A CAVE.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.867
ARE MORE EMBRACED BY THE CULTURE

18:56.068 --> 18:56.336
EUROPE.

TECHNICAL --

22:04.290 --> 22:12.565
>> NO.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.735
>> IS UNHAPPINESS NECESSARY FOR

22:15.735 --> 22:17.269
GREAT ART?

22:17.269 --> 22:24.411
>> IT'S NECESSARY, BUT

22:24.411 --> 22:24.711
MAGNIFICO.

22:24.711 --> 22:29.416
>> YOU'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

22:29.416 --> 22:33.219
THAT.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.054

GREATEST OF SPANISH TRADITIONS,

TAPAS.

THAT'S RIGHT.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.320
TAPAS ARE FREE.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.755
IT SHOULDN'T WORK, BUT SOMEHOW

>> THAT WAS AMAZING, RIGHT?

26:54.013 --> 26:58.484
>> THAT MUSIC.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.586
>> FINALLY, BAR NUMBER TWO.

27:00.586 --> 27:00.820
OLIVER.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.189
THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS PACKED.

27:03.189 --> 27:03.890
BEER, PLEASE.

27:03.890 --> 27:09.361
AND WITH IT COMES A DELIGHTFUL

27:09.361 --> 27:10.029
TAPA OF MUSSELS SEEMED IN BUTTER

27:10.029 --> 27:10.997
AND OLIVE OIL.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.665
>> THAT'S A GREAT TAPA.

27:12.665 --> 27:13.833
THIS IS WHAT'S DIFFERENT.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.267
PEOPLE COME IN HERE AND THEY

27:15.267 --> 27:16.769
WILL EAT LIKE THIS PERFECTLY

27:16.769 --> 27:17.436
HAPPY.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.906
PERFECTLY CONTENT TO FOREGO THE

27:19.906 --> 27:21.173
TABLE, COME HERE, STAND AROUND

27:21.173 --> 27:23.876
AND EAT LIKE THIS.

27:23.876 --> 27:28.881
>> THE GLASS OF WINE COMES WITH

27:28.881 --> 27:31.283
FRIED EGGPLANT AND CURRY.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.852
MORE WINE FOLLOWED BY THESE

27:32.852 --> 27:33.886
DELICIOUS LITTLE CLAMS.

27:33.886 --> 27:37.423
AND THE MAIN EVENT.

27:37.423 --> 27:40.693
>> NOW WE ARE TALKING.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.729
THESE ARE NOT TAPAS AND

27:42.729 --> 27:43.863
CONSEQUENTLY NOT FREE.

27:43.863 --> 27:49.702
BUT WORTH IT AT ANY PRICE.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.638
>> THAT'S SO TOTALLY AWESOME.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.707
WE DID GOOD WORK HERE.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.275
>> SHOULD WE GO ON?

27:56.275 --> 28:05.384
>> NO, LET'S MOVE ON.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.119
>> AS THIS DEATH MARCH OF TAPAS

28:07.119 --> 28:08.554
CONTINUES, THINGS START TO GET A

28:08.554 --> 28:08.921
LITTLE WEIRD.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.389
THIS IS THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.292
HE DOESN'T DO THIS AT HOME?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.226
>> NO.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.828
NOW I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.729
>> YES.

28:16.729 --> 28:17.629
>> EVERY DAY.

28:17.629 --> 28:18.630
>> GOOD.

28:18.630 --> 28:18.898
FINALLY.

28:18.898 --> 28:22.468
A LITTLE EMPATHY.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.905
I DO LIKE THE INCREASINGLY

28:25.905 --> 28:27.006
META-ASPECT OF THIS SHOW.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.776
I SHOULD REALLY BE LIVE

28:29.776 --> 28:30.176
SCREENING.

28:30.176 --> 28:34.947
THAT WOULD REALLY BE

28:34.947 --> 28:35.281
INTERESTING.

28:35.281 --> 28:39.585
FINALLY, JUST BAR GALLADO.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.652
JUST MAKING IT.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.088
WE'VE HAD A LOT TO EAT AND DRINK

28:42.088 --> 28:43.089
AT THIS POINT.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.992
SOME RESTRAINT NEEDS TO BE

28:45.992 --> 28:46.525
SHOWN.

28:46.525 --> 28:47.493
DUDE, FRIED FISH.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.427
LITTLE ONES.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.462
>> THEN WE'RE TALKING.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.463
>> AND CHEESE.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.265
>> BUT INSTEAD, THREE MORE

28:53.265 --> 29:01.941
BEERS, THREE MORE TAPAS.

29:01.941 --> 29:02.308
BABY LAMB CHOPS.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.442
>> THESE ARE SUPER GOOD.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.478
>> THESE ARE SUPER GOOD.

29:06.478 --> 29:07.646
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA

29:07.646 --> 29:08.447
OF SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.

29:08.447 --> 29:12.184
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING FOR

29:12.184 --> 29:13.119
NOTHING.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.620
>> IF SOMEBODY CAN GET DEMAND

29:14.620 --> 29:17.689
FOR IT IN THE U.S., THIS WILL

29:17.689 --> 29:19.792
TAKE OFF.

29:19.792 --> 29:20.126
>> NO, NEVER.

29:20.126 --> 29:20.827
>> REALLY?

29:20.827 --> 29:23.629
>> YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TAPAS

29:23.629 --> 29:24.030
CULTURE.

29:24.030 --> 29:24.964
YOU'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THE

29:24.964 --> 29:26.732
ENTIRE DAY, FROM THE MINUTE YOU

29:26.732 --> 29:27.800
GET UP IN AMERICA.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.467
NOT IN THE AFTERNOON.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.804
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

29:31.804 --> 29:33.639
>> I WANT TO WALK TO MY BAR, I

29:33.639 --> 29:34.907
WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BEER.

29:34.907 --> 29:41.347
>> I WANT A GOLDEN UNICORN.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.481
BOTH OF THOSE SCENARIOS ARE

29:42.481 --> 29:44.450
EQUALLY LIKELY.

29:53.826 --> 29:54.894
>>> EVERY STORYBOOK KINGDOM

29:54.894 --> 29:56.495
NEEDS A CASTLE.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.832
GRANADA, IT'S GOT A GOOD ONE.

29:59.832 --> 30:03.269
ONE OF THE MOST ENCHANTED,

30:03.269 --> 30:04.370
INSCRUTABLE, MADDENINGLY

30:04.370 --> 30:05.737
BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURES EVER

30:05.737 --> 30:06.906
CREATED BY MAN.

30:06.906 --> 30:10.242
BUILT ON TOP OF NINTH CENTURY

30:10.242 --> 30:12.078
FORTIFICATIONS AND ADDED TO AND

30:12.078 --> 30:13.779
ADDED TO AS HISTORY UNFOLDED

30:13.779 --> 30:15.882
THROUGH WARS AND TRAGEDY AND

30:15.882 --> 30:19.751
INVASION AND CONQUEST.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.287
>> IT'S VERY BARE.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.522
ALL YOU SEE ARE THE TINY

30:23.522 --> 30:23.789
WINDOWS.

30:23.789 --> 30:39.105
AND IT'S PROJECTING IING IMP

30:39.105 --> 30:39.471
IMPENATRABILITY.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.041
ZACK IS A CINEMATOGRAPHER, SO

30:42.041 --> 30:43.209
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT

30:43.209 --> 30:45.244
MIGHT GET A GRIP ON A GUY WHOSE

30:45.244 --> 30:46.778
PROFESSION IS THE INTRICATE PLAY

30:46.778 --> 30:50.883
BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.385
>> TRYING TO WEAVE NATURE,

30:53.385 --> 30:54.486
CALLIGRAPHY, SYMBOLS.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.089
THESE ARE ALL INSCRIPTIONS,

30:57.089 --> 31:02.494
TURNED INTO GRAPHICS.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.896
>> DEPICT WORDS FROM GOD.

31:03.896 --> 31:06.732
>> YES, BUT WHAT YOU CAN DEPICT,

31:06.732 --> 31:08.134
AND THIS IS WHAT THIS ENTIRE

31:08.134 --> 31:14.773
PLACE IS, IS GEOMETRIC SYSTEMS.

31:14.773 --> 31:30.089
>> YES.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.591
>> WHEN THE NASRI DYNASTY LIVED

31:32.591 --> 31:34.994
HERE, IT WAS A HARMONIOUS SPACE

31:34.994 --> 31:36.595
WHERE LIGHT, SHADE, WATER, THE

31:36.595 --> 31:38.497
TRANSIT OF THE MOON AND STARS

31:38.497 --> 31:40.432
WERE HARNESSED AND GLORIFIED.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.867
>> I THINK THE BEST ASSUMPTION

31:41.867 --> 31:42.801
IS NOTHING IS RANDOM.

31:42.801 --> 31:45.972
THEY CAME HERE AND LAID OUT

31:45.972 --> 31:50.042
EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO --

31:50.042 --> 31:51.377
>> A PLAN.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.778
IT WAS A PLACE FOR REFLECTION.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.513
EACH ELEMENT OF DESIGN

31:54.513 --> 31:56.148
PRESUMABLY INTENDED TO HAVE

31:56.148 --> 31:59.685
EFFECTS BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND

31:59.685 --> 32:00.052
RELIGIOUS.

32:00.052 --> 32:03.122
>> IT'S REALLY A

32:03.122 --> 32:05.624
CINEMATOGRAPHER'S PARADISE.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.294
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT LIGHT AND

32:08.294 --> 32:08.527
MAN.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.662
EVERYTHING IS FRAMING FOR THEM.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.298
>> HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO

32:12.298 --> 32:12.631
BUILD THIS?

32:12.631 --> 32:14.833
>> HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

32:14.833 --> 32:16.235
>> THAT'S WHY IT TAKES SO LONG

32:16.235 --> 32:18.137
FOR YOU TO GET THE SHOT?

32:18.137 --> 32:20.672
>> OH, SNAP.

32:20.672 --> 32:24.343
>> IN THE BUILDERS TIME,

32:24.343 --> 32:25.911
ASTRONOMIES, MATHEMATICIANS WERE

32:25.911 --> 32:28.647
LIKE PRIESTS, POSSESSORS OF

32:28.647 --> 32:30.382
DIVINE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE

32:30.382 --> 32:30.816
UNIVERSE WORKED.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.651
DID THEY WANT TO CONTEMPLATE

32:32.651 --> 32:34.186
NATURE OR CONQUER IT, CONTROL

32:34.186 --> 32:34.353
IT?

32:34.353 --> 32:35.921
>> THEY WERE CERTAINLY TRYING TO

32:35.921 --> 32:36.655
EMULATE IT.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.490
THEIR MATHEMATICS WERE TRYING TO

32:38.490 --> 32:40.159
FIGURE OUT HOW NATURE WORKED,

32:40.159 --> 32:41.260
PARTICULARLY THE SQUARE ROOTS

32:41.260 --> 32:44.430
AND THE REPETITION OF PATTERN.

32:44.430 --> 32:47.566
>> THEY SAW MATHEMATICAL

32:47.566 --> 32:48.167
PATTERNS IN THE SKY AND ON

32:48.167 --> 32:49.768
EARTH, THE WAY WATER MOVED AND

32:49.768 --> 32:51.837
RIPPLED, THE WAY THINGS GREW,

32:51.837 --> 32:54.906
THE SIMPLE PINE CONE, A FERN, A

32:54.906 --> 32:55.907
POMEGRANATE, AND THEY THOUGHT

32:55.907 --> 33:00.679
ABOUT THE BASIC TRUTHS THESE

33:00.679 --> 33:02.181
THINGS MIGHT REPRESENT.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.350
>> THESE SYMMETRIES CAN ALL BE

33:04.350 --> 33:05.784
SHUFFLED, SPUN ON ANY POINT AND

33:05.784 --> 33:06.785
THEY ALIGN AGAIN WITH

33:06.785 --> 33:07.086
THEMSELVES.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.355
SO IF YOU STRETCHED THEM OUT,

33:09.355 --> 33:11.523
FOR THEM THEY POINTED TO

33:11.523 --> 33:12.024
INFINI

33:12.024 --> 33:12.291
INFINITY.

33:12.291 --> 33:12.924
>> WE WILL UNDERSTAND ALL

33:12.924 --> 33:13.192
THINGS.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.528
>> THROUGH CONTEMPLATING SACRED

33:16.528 --> 33:19.265
GEE OK TOMETRY

33:19.265 --> 33:19.531
GEOMETRY.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.100
>> HOW DID NATURE UNFOLD,

33:21.100 --> 33:21.900
PATTERN ITSELF?

33:21.900 --> 33:23.635
COULD THE BASIC DESIGNS OF

33:23.635 --> 33:25.871
NATURE, EVEN IF DIVINE, BE

33:25.871 --> 33:26.505
REPLICATED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT

33:26.505 --> 33:28.040
STRUCTURE?

33:28.040 --> 33:30.042
THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE

33:30.042 --> 33:32.978
RIDDLE OF GOD HERE.

33:32.978 --> 33:38.016
>> EXACTLY.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.793
>>> AN HOUR'S DRIVE FROM

34:21.793 --> 34:23.027
GRANADA, THE MEDITERRANEAN.

34:23.027 --> 34:24.763
UNLIKE MUCH OF SPAIN'S COASTLINE

34:24.763 --> 34:26.532
RUINED BY REAL ESTATE

34:26.532 --> 34:27.632
SPECULATORS AND OVERDEVELOPMENT,

34:27.632 --> 34:28.300
THE COAST AROUND HERE IS LARGELY

34:28.300 --> 34:31.203
UNSPOILED.

34:31.203 --> 34:34.039
I'M ON MY WAY TO A MORAGA, A

34:34.039 --> 34:35.940
TRADITION IN THESE PARTS BEST

34:35.940 --> 34:37.109
DESCRIBED AS THE LOCAL VERSION

34:37.109 --> 34:46.217
OF A BEACH BARBECUE.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.820
WORKING THE GRILL, CHEF JUAN

34:48.820 --> 34:51.657
ANDRES MORIA.

34:51.657 --> 34:54.793
HE HEADS THE EL CLAUSTRO IN

34:54.793 --> 34:55.161
GRANADA.

34:55.161 --> 34:58.530
WE'RE JOINED BY FELLOW CHEF

34:58.530 --> 34:59.731
RAFAEL LUCA.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.200
>> THIS IS SOME GOOD-LOOKING

35:01.200 --> 35:05.371
FOOD HERE.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.174
>> SOME OF THAT SIMPLE SALMAREHO

35:08.174 --> 35:09.241
ON TOAST.

35:09.241 --> 35:13.412
ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.848
>> SOME OLIVE OIL.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.151
>> IT'S SPICY.

35:19.151 --> 35:19.451
AND BITTER.

35:19.451 --> 35:24.590
>> AWESOME.

35:24.590 --> 35:30.229
>> SPAIN IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.

35:30.229 --> 35:34.933
WE'RE NOT EVEN EATING YET AND

35:34.933 --> 35:36.067
IT'S GOOD.

35:36.067 --> 35:40.906
>> OH, SWEET.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.374
>> WANT MASS.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.109
THAT IS LIKE THE BEST THING IN

35:44.109 --> 35:44.543
THE WORLD.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.777
>> THE WHOLE THING?

35:45.777 --> 35:49.615
>> THIS?

35:49.615 --> 35:51.717
YEAH.

35:51.717 --> 35:51.983
CHOCOLATE.

35:51.983 --> 35:56.722
THIS IS THE CHOCOLATE OF THE

35:56.722 --> 35:57.055
GODS.

35:57.055 --> 36:00.359
>> SOME GRILLED OCTOPUS, AND

36:00.359 --> 36:03.295
SOME NICE PORK TENDERLOIN.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.697
AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, A

36:05.697 --> 36:09.635
PARTICULARLY DELICIOUS MORCIA,

36:09.635 --> 36:16.708
FLESH BLOOD SAUSAGE.

36:16.708 --> 36:20.312
>> I'M

36:20.312 --> 36:23.114
BEAUTIFUL.

36:23.114 --> 36:26.252
LOOKING GOOD.

36:26.252 --> 36:26.418
WOW.

36:26.418 --> 36:27.286
LOOK AT THAT.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.255
A LOT OF FAT.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.055
>> YEAH.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.156
IT'S QUITE NICE.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.424
>> THOSE WERE HAPPY PIGS.

36:32.424 --> 36:36.462
LAZY PIGS.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.996
>> THE ONES WE BREED HERE.

36:37.996 --> 36:38.997
>> YEAH, THE PIGS AND THE BULLS

36:38.997 --> 36:46.104
ARE VERY HAPPY HERE.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.239
OKAY.

36:47.239 --> 36:47.706
ENOUGH WITH THE WORK.

36:47.706 --> 36:47.973
LET'S EAT.

36:47.973 --> 37:01.520
NICE.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.289
AWESOME.

37:03.289 --> 37:03.589
GREAT MEAL.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.523
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.359
THIS IS THE DREAM OF ALL THE

37:07.359 --> 37:07.626
WORLD.

37:07.626 --> 37:13.932
THE DREAM IS TO LIVE IN GRENADA.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.334
WORK IN THE MORNING AND GO OUT

37:15.334 --> 37:16.201
AND HAVE THAT LIFE.

37:16.201 --> 37:19.538
GO OUT AND SEE YOUR FRIENDS AND

37:19.538 --> 37:21.707
EAT DAPA AND DRINK RED WINE AND

37:21.707 --> 37:23.141
BE IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.643
TO HAVE THIS KIND OF MUSIC AND

37:24.643 --> 37:25.844
THIS FOOD AND THIS KIND OF

37:25.844 --> 37:29.047
CULTURE AND TO LOOK OUT THE

37:29.047 --> 37:29.548
WINDOW AND TO SEE SPAIN.
