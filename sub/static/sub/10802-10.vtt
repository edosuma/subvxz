00:02.247 --> 00:05.523
Captain's log, stardate 46357.4.

00:05.607 --> 00:07.882
We have rendezvoused
with the Starship Cairo,

00:07.967 --> 00:09.844
near the Cardassian border

00:09.927 --> 00:13.044
for an urgent
meeting with Vice Admiral Necheyev.

00:14.207 --> 00:15.196
Come!

00:18.007 --> 00:21.079
- Capt Jean-Luc Picard.
- Admiral, welcome aboard.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.727
Thank you.
That'll be all, Commander.

00:25.087 --> 00:27.965
- Coffee? Tea?
- Thank you, no.

00:28.047 --> 00:31.084
I'm afraid there's
no time for pleasantries.

00:31.167 --> 00:34.204
I'm here to relieve you
of command of the Enterprise.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

01:03.327 --> 01:06.876
Space, the final frontier.

01:07.887 --> 01:11.880
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:11.967 --> 01:15.880
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

01:17.127 --> 01:20.437
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

01:21.527 --> 01:25.440
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

02:23.607 --> 02:27.805
The Cardassian forces recently
withdrawn from the Bajoran Sector

02:27.887 --> 02:30.799
have been redeployed
along the Federation border.

02:30.887 --> 02:33.003
They have mobilized three divisions

02:33.087 --> 02:36.124
and increased subspace
communications by 50 percent.

02:36.207 --> 02:39.597
They may be preparing for
an incursion into Federation space.

02:39.687 --> 02:41.723
Are the Cardassians ready for a war?

02:41.807 --> 02:44.321
I didn't say war. I said incursion.

02:44.967 --> 02:47.083
Intelligence reports suggest

02:47.167 --> 02:50.364
they'll try to seize
a disputed system on the border.

02:50.447 --> 02:54.804
They may be gambling that
we won't go to war over one system.

02:54.887 --> 02:56.161
Will we?

02:56.247 --> 02:59.045
I hope we won't need
to make that decision.

02:59.687 --> 03:04.477
The Enterprise is to meet the
Cardassian representative for talks.

03:05.007 --> 03:08.397
We hope the presence of
the Federation flagship on the border

03:08.487 --> 03:12.719
will send a message
about how seriously we view this.

03:13.127 --> 03:14.685
Where's Capt Picard?

03:15.447 --> 03:18.996
The Captain, Chief Medical Officer
and Security Chief

03:19.087 --> 03:22.124
have been reassigned.
That's all I can tell you.

03:24.167 --> 03:28.445
- Do you know Edward Jellico?
- He's in command of the Cairo.

03:28.527 --> 03:30.518
I've heard of him. I don't know...

03:30.607 --> 03:32.996
I'm giving him
command of the Enterprise.

03:33.087 --> 03:37.160
Capt Jellico helped negotiate
the original armistice two years ago.

03:37.247 --> 03:41.479
I believe he is the most qualified
person to lead this mission.

03:41.567 --> 03:45.355
The change of command will
take place at 1300. Thank you.

03:51.887 --> 03:54.959
Admiral, with all due respect,

03:55.807 --> 04:00.278
Capt Jellico needn't be given command
just to conduct a negotiation.

04:00.407 --> 04:04.195
I disagree. The Enterprise
will be in a dangerous situation.

04:04.287 --> 04:08.405
I want someone who has a lot of
experience with the Cardassians.

04:08.487 --> 04:11.923
No offence, Commander,
but that's not you.

04:26.327 --> 04:30.115
- Halt!
- Computer, freeze program.

04:30.207 --> 04:32.926
You were five seconds slower
that time.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.316
You increased the difficulty, sir.

04:35.407 --> 04:38.080
It'll be more difficult
where we're going.

04:38.167 --> 04:41.682
- Which is where exactly?
- I'm sorry, I can't tell you yet.

04:41.767 --> 04:44.122
It would help
to know about our mission.

04:44.207 --> 04:47.119
Mr. Worf, I have my orders.
I'm sure you understand.

04:47.207 --> 04:49.767
Doctor, this deflector
wasn't set properly.

04:49.847 --> 04:53.806
The emitter ray must block
the entire passage, or it's useless.

04:53.887 --> 04:57.038
Sorry, I was busy escaping from
that Cardassian,

04:57.127 --> 04:59.004
or maybe it was the falling rocks.

04:59.607 --> 05:03.805
I understand this is difficult.
I can only ask you to trust me.

05:06.207 --> 05:07.879
Alright, let's do it again.

05:07.967 --> 05:11.676
Mr. Worf, time the Doctor and me
through that first tunnel.

05:11.767 --> 05:15.123
And this time, we're going
to pick up those five seconds.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.039
Welcome aboard, sir. I'm...

05:23.127 --> 05:27.723
William T Riker, class of '57.
I look forward to serving with you.

05:27.807 --> 05:28.876
And I you.

05:28.967 --> 05:32.039
I'm sure this change
has taken everybody by surprise.

05:32.127 --> 05:33.640
Well, yes, sir.

05:33.727 --> 05:37.436
It surprised me, too.
I admit I miss the Cairo already.

05:37.527 --> 05:40.599
But a Galaxy-class ship,
that's something special.

05:40.687 --> 05:43.599
I see why you turned down
a command to stay aboard.

05:43.687 --> 05:44.597
Yes, sir.

05:44.687 --> 05:48.043
- How many duty watches do we stand?
- A standard three shifts.

05:48.127 --> 05:50.766
I'd like to change to four,
starting tonight.

05:50.847 --> 05:55.238
I also want to examine duty rosters
and crew evaluations right away.

05:55.327 --> 05:59.445
I want readiness reports
from department heads by 1400

05:59.527 --> 06:02.280
and a meeting of the senior staff
at 1500.

06:02.367 --> 06:06.246
- Do you prefer Will or William?
- Will, sir.

06:06.327 --> 06:10.036
- Where are my quarters, Will?
- Cabin 735, deck...

06:10.127 --> 06:13.119
Deck seven.
I'll see you at 1300 hours.

06:34.287 --> 06:35.879
Yeah, I know.

06:35.967 --> 06:40.438
Wearing these uniforms reminds me
of my first days at the Academy.

06:40.527 --> 06:41.846
Attention to orders!

06:48.847 --> 06:50.439
"To Capt Jean-Luc Picard,

06:50.527 --> 06:54.566
Commanding Officer USS Enterprise,
stardate 46358.1 ."

06:54.647 --> 06:58.401
"You are requested and required
to relinquish command

06:58.487 --> 07:01.957
to Capt Edward Jellico,
Commanding Officer, USS Cairo,

07:02.047 --> 07:06.757
as of this date. Signed, Vice Admiral
Alynna Necheyev. Starfleet Command."

07:06.847 --> 07:10.635
Computer, transfer all command codes
to Capt Jellico.

07:10.727 --> 07:13.321
Voice authorization,
Picard, Delta five.

07:13.407 --> 07:14.806
Transfer complete.

07:14.887 --> 07:19.278
USS Enterprise now under command
of Capt Edward Jellico.

07:21.167 --> 07:23.840
- I relieve you, sir.
- I stand relieved.

07:25.447 --> 07:26.243
Dismissed.

07:38.687 --> 07:40.996
I wonder how permanent
this is gonna be.

07:41.087 --> 07:42.679
I don't know.

07:42.767 --> 07:47.124
They don't usually go through
the ceremony if it's just temporary.

07:53.607 --> 07:57.600
- Sore?
- Sore doesn't begin to describe it!

08:03.167 --> 08:06.557
I know. I wish I could talk about it.

08:10.687 --> 08:13.963
Most systems were changed
at the last overhaul.

08:14.047 --> 08:17.676
They won't be a problem.
But you might check the port...

08:17.767 --> 08:20.964
I'll take care of the Enterprise,
Jean-Luc.

08:21.047 --> 08:23.481
You don't have to mother me.

08:26.647 --> 08:28.205
How's your team shaping up?

08:29.527 --> 08:33.405
Very well. But I would prefer
more recent intelligence

08:33.486 --> 08:36.126
on the exact layout
of the installation.

08:36.207 --> 08:39.005
Our most current information
is two years old.

08:39.087 --> 08:44.639
Two years? I don't know
how Necheyev talked you into this.

08:44.727 --> 08:47.685
She gave me no choice.

08:47.767 --> 08:50.964
Well, maybe there's something
we can do to help.

08:51.047 --> 08:54.801
We'll launch a class-five probe
just before we reach the border.

08:54.887 --> 08:57.765
You could pick up the telemetry
aboard the shuttle.

08:57.847 --> 09:00.486
Now that would be extremely helpful.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.685
Will.

09:04.687 --> 09:06.598
Captain. Captain.

09:07.247 --> 09:11.923
We're scheduled to arrive at the
Cardassian border during Delta shift.

09:12.007 --> 09:16.000
Inform the Tactical Officer
I want to launch a class-five probe

09:16.087 --> 09:20.365
- just before we drop out of warp.
- I wanted to talk about Delta shift.

09:20.447 --> 09:24.963
Right now, Gamma shift will be on
duty on arrival. I'll inform them.

09:25.047 --> 09:27.766
Is there a problem with Delta shift,
Will?

09:27.847 --> 09:29.838
There is no Delta shift yet, sir.

09:29.927 --> 09:33.681
I've spoken to department heads
about changing to four shifts

09:33.767 --> 09:37.043
and they assure me it'll cause
major personnel problems.

09:37.127 --> 09:40.642
So you have not changed
the watch rotation?

09:43.127 --> 09:45.766
I was going to explain
after the ceremony, sir.

09:45.847 --> 09:48.566
Tell the department heads
that, as of now,

09:48.647 --> 09:51.445
the Enterprise
is on a four-shift rotation.

09:51.527 --> 09:54.837
I don't want to talk about it.
Get it done.

09:54.927 --> 09:59.318
Now, that means Delta shift will be
due to come on duty in two hours.

09:59.407 --> 10:02.877
I expect you to have it fully manned
and ready when it does.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.241
Is that clear?

10:06.247 --> 10:08.636
Yes, sir. If you'll excuse me, sir.

10:09.687 --> 10:11.040
Captain.

10:15.247 --> 10:18.478
He was your first officer
for five years.

10:18.567 --> 10:22.446
One of the finest officers
that I have ever served with.

10:22.527 --> 10:27.647
Of course he is, Jean-Luc.
I'm sure it'll all work out.

10:32.927 --> 10:36.203
Captain's log, stardate 46358.2.

10:36.287 --> 10:40.360
We are on course for a rendezvous
with the Cardassian ship, Reklar.

10:40.447 --> 10:44.326
Fortunately, I still have time to
prepare the crew for the task ahead.

10:44.407 --> 10:48.400
We need a bypass between the phaser
array and the secondary generators.

10:48.487 --> 10:51.957
Run the main deflector path
through the warp-power grid

10:52.047 --> 10:54.720
and the conduits
through the lateral relays.

10:54.807 --> 10:57.241
You may have to reconfigure
the interface.

10:57.327 --> 11:02.003
Sir, the interface was not designed
for that. It will take seven hours.

11:02.087 --> 11:06.922
Sir, our interface already routes
auxiliary power through three relays.

11:07.007 --> 11:10.079
I'm aware of your current design.
It's not good enough.

11:10.167 --> 11:14.718
If the talks fail, we'll be at war.
I want to be loaded for bear!

11:14.807 --> 11:16.206
- I'll get on it.
- Good.

11:16.287 --> 11:21.441
These stations should be devoted to
damage control and weapons status.

11:21.527 --> 11:24.485
- See they are manned at all times.
- Aye, sir.

11:25.287 --> 11:28.404
Mr. Data, how long
before we reach the rendezvous?

11:28.487 --> 11:31.047
We will arrive
in 5 1 hours, 32 minutes, sir.

11:31.127 --> 11:34.164
Schedule four battle drills,
one for each shift.

11:34.247 --> 11:37.717
Run a series of simulated attacks
from a Cardassian squadron.

11:37.807 --> 11:42.403
I want you to conduct the exercises
personally, Will. Get it done.

11:45.967 --> 11:49.562
Get that fish out of the ready room.
Data, you're with me.

11:59.927 --> 12:03.203
Power transfer
must be upgraded by 20 percent.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.721
Warp-coil efficiency is also poor.

12:05.807 --> 12:08.275
It's well within specifications.

12:08.367 --> 12:13.316
I'm not interested in the specs. The
efficiency must rise by 15 percent.

12:13.407 --> 12:14.999
15 percent!

12:15.087 --> 12:16.759
That is an attainable goal.

12:16.847 --> 12:22.205
We will have to realign the warp coil
and take the secondary grid off line.

12:22.287 --> 12:25.484
Very good. That's exactly
what I want you to do.

12:25.567 --> 12:27.046
To take this grid off line,

12:27.127 --> 12:30.961
we'll have to shut down
the labs and geological research.

12:31.047 --> 12:35.040
We're not on a research mission.
Get it done in two days.

12:35.127 --> 12:37.641
I believe that is also attainable.

12:37.727 --> 12:40.082
If we utilize
the entire department,

12:40.167 --> 12:42.886
there should be
sufficient manpower to do it.

12:42.967 --> 12:45.481
Sure, if nobody sleeps for two days!

12:45.567 --> 12:50.641
Then you'd better get to it, Geordi.
You have some work to do. Data.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.566
Yes?

13:12.207 --> 13:16.120
- May I speak with you, Captain?
- Deanna. Come in.

13:22.447 --> 13:25.644
The latest masterpieces
from my son.

13:26.567 --> 13:28.364
It's an elephant.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.078
I think.

13:31.167 --> 13:33.761
Definitely an elephant.

13:33.847 --> 13:38.079
I'm glad you're here. I'd like
to go over the duty roster with you.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.600
I'd be happy to.

13:39.687 --> 13:43.396
But first, I'd like to talk
about how the change in Command

13:43.487 --> 13:45.045
is affecting the crew.

13:47.207 --> 13:49.038
I've noticed some resistance.

13:49.127 --> 13:53.564
I wouldn't call it resistance.
More like uncertainty.

13:54.327 --> 13:58.639
Most of them had served under
Capt Picard for several years.

13:58.727 --> 14:02.561
They knew him
and they knew what he expected.

14:02.647 --> 14:05.639
Now they're being asked
to adjust to a new captain

14:05.727 --> 14:08.799
and a new way of doing things.

14:08.887 --> 14:11.640
And they're uncertain how to react.

14:12.367 --> 14:14.517
I see your point.

14:14.607 --> 14:16.643
This can be very unsettling to them.

14:16.727 --> 14:18.718
And to you.

14:19.767 --> 14:22.565
Perhaps everyone just needs time.

14:22.647 --> 14:25.798
Time for you to get to know
and trust the crew,

14:25.887 --> 14:30.438
and time for them to understand
how you want things done.

14:30.527 --> 14:33.883
I'm glad you brought this
to my attention, Deanna.

14:34.967 --> 14:38.676
Unfortunately, I don't have time
for a honeymoon with the crew.

14:39.167 --> 14:41.761
You've clearly given this
a lot of thought.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.884
I'd like you to take charge
of the morale situation.

14:44.967 --> 14:49.358
Please see to it that they make
the adjustment quickly and easily.

14:50.047 --> 14:53.756
I have a meeting with the new
security chief in five minutes.

14:53.847 --> 14:59.046
The duty roster will have to wait.
Thank you, Counsellor.

15:02.967 --> 15:05.242
By the way, ...

15:06.247 --> 15:11.196
..I prefer a certain formality
on the bridge.

15:11.287 --> 15:14.802
I'd appreciate it if you wore
standard uniform while on duty.

15:16.247 --> 15:17.919
Of course, sir.

15:22.687 --> 15:25.838
He's asked me
to re-route half the power systems,

15:25.927 --> 15:28.839
change duty rosters,
realign the warp coils,

15:28.927 --> 15:31.487
and he's moved a third
of my crew to Security.

15:31.567 --> 15:35.799
You're not alone. He's made major
changes in every department on board.

15:35.887 --> 15:41.086
I don't mind changes or hard work,
but the man isn't giving me time!

15:41.167 --> 15:43.283
Someone must make him see reason.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.403
It won't be me. He's made that clear.

15:45.487 --> 15:49.002
Then can I make a suggestion?
Talk to Capt Picard.

15:49.087 --> 15:51.681
Maybe he can do something.
We just need time.

15:51.767 --> 15:54.327
Alright.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.805
Come!

16:16.527 --> 16:20.281
- Are you alright, sir?
- Yes, I am.

16:20.367 --> 16:24.645
But the last time I had to train like
this was for the Academy marathon.

16:24.727 --> 16:29.357
But I'm managing.
What can I do for you?

16:30.567 --> 16:33.286
It's nothing urgent.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.358
Goodnight.

16:51.007 --> 16:54.761
I am to maintain radio silence
until the mission's complete.

16:54.847 --> 16:59.204
Well, we'll monitor your channel
in case you do need to transmit.

16:59.287 --> 17:03.121
Bridge to Captain. We're at
the shuttle departure coordinates.

17:03.207 --> 17:04.765
Did you launch the probe?

17:04.847 --> 17:07.520
Yes, sir. I wasn't aware
you wanted to be informed.

17:07.607 --> 17:10.804
Thank you. Jellico out.

17:12.646 --> 17:15.923
I can see why he's still
only a first officer.

17:16.007 --> 17:19.477
Captain, I would just
like you to know that Cmdr Riker...

17:19.567 --> 17:23.355
I've read your reports, Jean-Luc.
I know you think highly of him.

17:23.446 --> 17:27.884
Not just me. He's been decorated
by Starfleet Command five times.

17:27.967 --> 17:30.879
He's been offered his own ship
more than once.

17:30.967 --> 17:35.757
I think if you just gave him
a chance, you'd find him outstanding.

17:38.927 --> 17:42.602
Jean-Luc,
let's be candid for a moment.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.201
The Cardassians
won't listen to reason

17:45.287 --> 17:48.836
and the Federation
won't give in to their demands.

17:48.927 --> 17:52.442
And the chances are you won't
be coming back from this mission.

17:52.527 --> 17:54.597
I want this ship ready for action

17:54.687 --> 18:01.525
and I don't have time to give
Will Riker or anyone else a chance.

18:04.207 --> 18:09.235
And forgive me for being blunt,
but the Enterprise is mine now.

18:14.527 --> 18:18.122
Well, here's hoping
you beat the odds.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.597
- Good hunting.
- Thank you.

18:22.687 --> 18:24.405
Jean-Luc.

18:26.847 --> 18:28.360
I believe this is yours.

18:54.727 --> 18:58.242
Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.
We have cleared the shuttle bay.

18:58.327 --> 19:00.363
Acknowledged. Good luck.

19:00.447 --> 19:02.642
Thank you, Enterprise.

19:05.207 --> 19:11.680
Well, now that we're under way,
I can tell you about our mission.

19:11.767 --> 19:15.123
Starfleet Intelligence
believes that the Cardassians

19:15.207 --> 19:17.767
are developing a metagenic weapon.

19:18.527 --> 19:20.324
Oh, my God!

19:21.407 --> 19:23.921
I am not familiar with metagenics.

19:24.007 --> 19:28.762
Genetically engineered viruses
designed to destroy whole ecosystems.

19:28.847 --> 19:31.600
When metagenic toxins
enter an atmosphere,

19:31.687 --> 19:36.966
they mutate and seek out and destroy
all forms of DNA they encounter.

19:37.047 --> 19:40.005
In a few days, everything is dead.

19:40.087 --> 19:43.966
In a month, the agent breaks down
and dissipates completely,

19:44.047 --> 19:47.483
leaving every city, every road,

19:47.567 --> 19:50.957
every piece of equipment
perfectly intact.

19:51.047 --> 19:53.959
Leaving the planet
safe to be conquered.

19:55.207 --> 19:59.644
Wouldn't using such a weapon pose
as great a risk to the attacker?

19:59.727 --> 20:03.686
That's why biological weapons
were outlawed years ago.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.235
Even the Romulans
abide by the agreements.

20:06.327 --> 20:09.319
Starfleet Intelligence
believes the Cardassians

20:09.407 --> 20:12.046
are developing
a new delivery system,

20:12.127 --> 20:15.961
one that would protect them
from accidental exposure.

20:16.527 --> 20:18.757
They believe the Cardassians

20:18.847 --> 20:22.965
are testing a way of launching
dormant metagenic material

20:23.047 --> 20:25.038
on a subspace carrier wave.

20:25.127 --> 20:30.679
So they could activate the toxins
after the launch, avoiding exposure.

20:31.927 --> 20:37.877
Because the subspace wave would
appear as background radiation,

20:37.967 --> 20:41.846
no one would realize what was
happening till it was too late.

20:42.447 --> 20:44.836
Now, for the past few weeks,

20:44.927 --> 20:49.125
theta-band subspace emissions
have been detected from Celtris III.

20:49.207 --> 20:54.964
These may indicate that a metagenic
delivery system is in operation.

20:55.047 --> 20:58.084
- What do we know about Celtris III?
- Very little.

20:58.167 --> 21:01.603
It was thought uninhabited
until these emissions began.

21:01.687 --> 21:05.839
Starfleet believes the Cardassians
may have a secret research lab

21:05.927 --> 21:08.395
somewhere below
the planet's surface.

21:08.487 --> 21:12.958
Our orders are
to penetrate this installation

21:13.047 --> 21:17.598
and determine if the Cardassians
are building a metagenic weapon.

21:18.727 --> 21:23.596
- And if they are?
- Destroy it. At any cost.

21:24.847 --> 21:29.159
When I was on the Stargazer,
we tested theta-band carrier waves.

21:29.247 --> 21:34.037
I'm here because of my familiarity
with methods of generating them.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.436
Mr. Worf, your presence is obvious.

21:36.527 --> 21:41.476
Doctor, your job will be to locate
and destroy any biotoxins we find.

21:42.327 --> 21:45.717
Celtris III is in Cardassian space.

21:47.087 --> 21:49.237
How will we get there undetected?

21:49.327 --> 21:54.606
I know a way of acquiring
some discreet transport.

21:54.687 --> 21:59.317
Mr. Worf,
set a course for Torman V.

22:20.207 --> 22:21.879
If he doesn't pay up,

22:21.967 --> 22:27.405
I know three large Ferengi
who will not be so forgiving.

22:32.567 --> 22:35.843
- I didn't do it!
- I'm not accusing you of anything.

22:36.207 --> 22:38.118
What do you want, then?

22:39.807 --> 22:41.763
We're looking for DaiMon Solok.

22:43.527 --> 22:44.482
Why?

22:44.567 --> 22:47.286
We have a business proposition
to discuss.

22:49.247 --> 22:53.763
Solok is a very busy,
very important man. He isn't here.

22:58.247 --> 23:00.238
But I could relay a message.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.844
Good.
Please will you tell DaiMon Solok

23:03.927 --> 23:08.637
that we are interested
in transportation to Celtris III.

23:10.047 --> 23:12.607
That's a Cardassian planet.

23:14.047 --> 23:17.437
Now, we understand
that DaiMon Solok

23:17.527 --> 23:21.964
runs cargo there from time to time.

23:22.687 --> 23:24.917
Solok is no smuggler!

23:25.007 --> 23:30.604
Yes, but if Solok were to go to
Celtris III, for legitimate reasons,

23:30.687 --> 23:36.080
we would be interested in quietly
booking passage for the journey.

23:39.367 --> 23:44.361
I don't think he would be interested
in dealing with Federation spies!

23:45.167 --> 23:46.441
You know, ...

23:48.127 --> 23:52.120
..I heard that Solok was quite a man.

23:52.447 --> 23:55.484
Well, yes!

23:55.567 --> 23:59.685
He is an extraordinary man!

24:00.327 --> 24:04.605
That's why we came here,
because only Solok could help us.

24:06.007 --> 24:09.283
I guess there's some things
even Solok can't do.

24:09.927 --> 24:11.519
It's too bad.

24:12.767 --> 24:16.203
Because if he could, ...

24:18.047 --> 24:21.517
..I would be very,

24:22.487 --> 24:24.603
- very...
- Yes?

24:25.607 --> 24:27.598
..grateful.

24:29.127 --> 24:31.118
When do you want to leave?

24:57.887 --> 25:02.517
Beverly, make sure your tricorder
keeps a precise map of the route.

25:02.607 --> 25:05.360
- We could easily get lost in here.
- Right.

25:08.487 --> 25:11.365
I'm picking up
some subspace signals,

25:11.447 --> 25:14.245
but I can't seem
to get a lock on them.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.600
That's typical
of theta-band emissions.

25:17.687 --> 25:21.919
We have to compress the detection
bandwidth to determine the fix.

25:23.487 --> 25:27.639
The source emission
is 500 meters east of here.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.639
And 700 meters below.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.161
It's alright.

25:35.247 --> 25:39.684
They're called lynars, a kind
of Celtrine bat. They're harmless.

25:39.767 --> 25:40.961
Bats!

25:41.047 --> 25:43.481
You're not afraid of bats,
are you Worf?

25:43.567 --> 25:45.558
Of course not!

25:56.207 --> 26:00.758
First Officer's log, supplemental.
We've rendezvoused with the Reklar

26:00.847 --> 26:05.159
to begin diplomatic talks designed
to ease tension along the border.

26:05.247 --> 26:07.715
Gul Lemec
is in the observation lounge.

26:07.807 --> 26:10.082
Very good. I'll be in my ready room.

26:16.487 --> 26:17.840
Yes?

26:21.167 --> 26:24.284
I think there's been
a slight miscommunication.

26:24.367 --> 26:27.598
Did you want
to meet with Gul Lemec in here?

26:27.687 --> 26:31.282
No, the observation lounge
is appropriate.

26:32.487 --> 26:34.717
I see.

26:36.847 --> 26:41.204
Lemec is a Cardassian, and
Cardassians are like timber wolves,

26:41.287 --> 26:46.964
predators, bold in large numbers,
cautious by themselves,

26:47.047 --> 26:48.639
and with an instinctive need

26:48.727 --> 26:53.164
to establish a dominant position
in any social gathering.

26:53.247 --> 26:57.798
So you're establishing a dominant
position by making him wait for you?

27:01.527 --> 27:06.123
The trouble with wolves is that
sometimes in the fight for dominance,

27:06.207 --> 27:07.640
one of them ends up dead.

27:09.727 --> 27:12.161
In that case, the trick is...

27:13.527 --> 27:17.281
..to be the wolf
that's still standing at the end.

27:27.367 --> 27:29.597
The floor is over 500 meters down.

27:29.687 --> 27:34.238
There doesn't seem to be a way round.
We'll have to rappel from here.

27:34.327 --> 27:37.558
This is sheer granite.
We'll have to use fusing pitons.

27:39.207 --> 27:41.482
We could try
to find another way down.

27:41.567 --> 27:45.196
That would take several hours.
We don't have the time.

27:46.447 --> 27:51.043
- Not afraid of heights, are you?
- Of course not.

28:19.927 --> 28:24.318
Remember to control your descent.
And don't get the lines tangled.

28:24.807 --> 28:25.876
I'll remember!

28:27.447 --> 28:29.563
Alright?

28:48.607 --> 28:51.041
I've been waiting for over an hour...

28:51.127 --> 28:55.086
I'm Capt Jellico. You know
Cmdr Riker. This is Lt Cmdr Troi.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.282
Let's get to it.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.927
This is a deliberate insult.

28:59.007 --> 29:01.680
I have been kept waiting
for over an hour!

29:01.767 --> 29:04.520
Then I'm sure you're ready to talk.

29:08.967 --> 29:12.243
I did not agree
to allow others into this meeting.

29:12.327 --> 29:15.000
If it alarms you,
I can ask them to leave.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.237
I am not alarmed, but we did not...

29:17.327 --> 29:20.922
A great many people are depending
on our efforts, Gul Lemec.

29:21.007 --> 29:22.884
Let's not quibble over minutiae.

29:24.807 --> 29:28.322
I have come to negotiate
a Federation withdrawal,

29:28.407 --> 29:31.285
not to be dictated to
by some mere captain.

29:34.487 --> 29:37.957
I can see you're not serious
about these talks.

29:38.047 --> 29:41.926
If the Cardassian Union
truly wishes to discuss peace,

29:42.007 --> 29:45.682
they can send someone who can
negotiate in a civilised manner.

29:52.527 --> 29:54.518
Captain on the bridge.

29:58.487 --> 29:59.886
Let him stew for a minute,

29:59.967 --> 30:03.721
then tell him you've convinced me
to meet him once more.

30:03.807 --> 30:06.082
Tell him he needs to be
more reasonable,

30:06.167 --> 30:07.919
because I'm so unreasonable.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.475
Lemec will want
his own aides on board.

30:10.567 --> 30:13.081
Pretend to worry that I'll object,

30:13.167 --> 30:16.318
then grudgingly agree to two aides.
No more.

30:16.407 --> 30:19.365
- Understood?
- Aye, sir.

30:22.207 --> 30:26.644
Well, I'll say this for him.
He's sure of himself.

30:26.727 --> 30:28.524
No, he's not.

30:39.407 --> 30:43.923
The installation should be
about 300 meters this way.

30:48.047 --> 30:51.926
I don't suppose we'll find
another way back up there.

30:52.007 --> 30:55.079
- I doubt it.
- That's what I thought.

31:26.287 --> 31:32.920
There's a lava tube beyond here
that runs for 75 meters.

31:33.647 --> 31:38.118
Then it connects with another
chamber. We need to get through here.

31:41.927 --> 31:45.761
This tube opens up beyond this crack.

31:45.847 --> 31:47.838
We could widen the opening,

31:47.927 --> 31:50.999
then we should be able
to crawl through. Mr. Worf.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.635
A phaser at level 16 should suffice.

31:59.727 --> 32:00.842
Make it so.

32:13.527 --> 32:15.518
Well done, Mr. Worf.

32:32.207 --> 32:34.767
Gul Lemec, a pleasure.

32:35.487 --> 32:39.400
May I present my aides,
Glinn Corak and Glinn Tajor?

32:39.487 --> 32:41.478
Welcome aboard.

32:52.767 --> 32:55.406
For three weeks,
you've been massing troops,

32:55.487 --> 32:59.400
assembling strike forces
and pulling ships from their patrols.

32:59.487 --> 33:02.797
We will not stand for
this clearly provocative behaviour.

33:02.887 --> 33:05.003
I see the Federation spy network

33:05.087 --> 33:07.806
has again provided
faulty information.

33:07.887 --> 33:12.199
We are conducting routine training
operations, nothing more.

33:12.287 --> 33:13.845
Then I'm sure you won't mind

33:13.927 --> 33:18.557
if we send a few starships in
for our own training operations.

33:18.647 --> 33:21.445
Your fleet deployments
do not concern us.

33:21.527 --> 33:23.438
However, we are very concerned

33:23.527 --> 33:27.759
by your refusal to vacate territories
which are clearly Cardassian.

33:27.847 --> 33:31.442
You gave up your claims
when you signed the armistice!

33:31.527 --> 33:33.722
You couldn't take those worlds
by force.

33:33.807 --> 33:35.638
Now you want us to give you them.

33:35.727 --> 33:38.878
Captain, please,
we should listen to them.

33:42.087 --> 33:46.683
Gul Lemec, the systems are still
under negotiation under the treaty.

33:46.767 --> 33:50.123
Negotiations
which we have pursued in good faith.

33:50.207 --> 33:53.722
Unfortunately, the Federation
has not been as forthcoming.

33:53.807 --> 33:56.799
So, to speed things up,
you prepare for war!

33:56.887 --> 33:59.276
We are preparing
to defend ourselves.

33:59.687 --> 34:04.556
- The Federation won't start a war.
- That has always been your position.

34:06.007 --> 34:11.001
However, I have heard reports
that a small Federation team

34:11.087 --> 34:13.806
has already been sent
into our territory.

34:14.567 --> 34:16.956
Of course, I don't believe it.

34:17.047 --> 34:20.277
Such an attempt
would almost certainly fail.

34:20.367 --> 34:21.925
And, even if it succeeded,

34:22.007 --> 34:27.127
it would trigger
a very serious response on our part.

34:27.687 --> 34:29.882
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.561
Then there's no need for worry.

34:34.967 --> 34:37.844
A brief recess
would seem to be in order.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.164
Very well.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.237
Where is Capt Picard?

34:47.327 --> 34:48.601
Reassigned.

34:48.687 --> 34:52.475
Well, I hope his new assignment
is not too dangerous.

34:52.567 --> 34:57.482
It would be a shame if something
were to happen to such a...

34:57.567 --> 35:00.001
Such a noted officer.

35:01.327 --> 35:02.999
Yes, ...

35:04.007 --> 35:05.804
..it would.

35:16.087 --> 35:18.237
Only a few more meters.

35:51.087 --> 35:52.839
Beverly! Get out of there!

35:55.607 --> 35:57.199
Beverly!

36:08.007 --> 36:09.645
I have her!

36:14.927 --> 36:17.122
- Are you alright?
- I think so.

36:18.527 --> 36:20.961
Next time,
you try bringing up the rear.

36:21.047 --> 36:23.481
We're nearly there.
Can you continue?

36:38.847 --> 36:41.884
Looks like a maintenance hatch
to the installation.

36:41.967 --> 36:45.562
I'm picking up
three proximity sensors around it.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.365
Sensor echoes established,

36:56.447 --> 36:59.996
but the false image
will only last a few minutes.

37:03.287 --> 37:07.280
The hatch is magnetically sealed,
but I believe I can bypass it.

37:07.367 --> 37:10.916
I can't get a scan through
the hatch. It's been shielded.

37:11.007 --> 37:16.320
We have no choice. Remember,
aim low. Short controlled bursts.

37:21.007 --> 37:22.122
Ready.

37:23.247 --> 37:24.282
Now!

37:36.247 --> 37:40.206
There's no one here. There's no lab.

37:47.847 --> 37:49.838
It's a trap! Come on!

38:20.847 --> 38:21.916
Captain!

38:36.927 --> 38:38.519
Let's go!

38:38.607 --> 38:39.926
- The Captain!
- No!

38:40.007 --> 38:43.204
There are five more of them
heading this way.

38:43.887 --> 38:45.286
Come on!

38:46.887 --> 38:48.400
Now!

39:01.207 --> 39:02.925
Come on!

39:16.687 --> 39:18.678
Captain on the bridge.

39:21.287 --> 39:22.845
What have you got, Will?

39:22.927 --> 39:27.000
We're getting coded messages from
a Cardassian planet on the border.

39:27.087 --> 39:29.157
- Which planet?
- Celtris III.

39:29.247 --> 39:32.000
Can you detect
any theta-band emissions?

39:32.087 --> 39:36.956
There are residual traces. It seems
there were emissions until just now.

39:37.047 --> 39:40.517
Open a secure channel
to Admiral Necheyev.

39:40.607 --> 39:43.917
- Priority two. In my ready room.
- Aye, sir.

39:56.447 --> 40:00.486
- Captain?
- Those emissions have just stopped.

40:00.567 --> 40:03.718
I'd say, one way or another,
our friends have finished.

40:03.807 --> 40:05.843
Have you heard from our friends?

40:07.727 --> 40:09.604
No.

40:09.687 --> 40:11.518
Let me know if you do.

40:11.607 --> 40:14.075
I would very much
like to see them again.

40:14.167 --> 40:15.998
So would l, Admiral.

40:32.287 --> 40:34.278
A challenge!

40:53.807 --> 40:56.560
You should prove
an interesting challenge.

40:57.447 --> 41:01.838
Possibly the most interesting
to come through that door in years.

41:01.927 --> 41:05.078
- What do you want?
- Why, you, of course.

41:06.727 --> 41:08.479
Picard!

41:09.087 --> 41:10.884
Jean-Luc.

41:12.487 --> 41:14.682
Serial number,

41:15.367 --> 41:22.921
SP-937-215.

41:24.087 --> 41:26.396
Son of Maurice and Yvette Picard.

41:27.287 --> 41:30.199
Born in Labarre, France.

41:30.287 --> 41:33.996
Formerly Captain of the Stargazer,

41:34.087 --> 41:40.003
where you conducted studies on
theta-band subspace carrier waves.

41:40.087 --> 41:42.237
Don't look so surprised.

41:42.327 --> 41:45.524
How could we lure the Captain
of the Federation flagship

41:45.607 --> 41:48.280
unless we knew
something of his background?

41:48.367 --> 41:52.804
So, you concocted an elaborate ruse
to bring me here. Why?

41:52.887 --> 41:56.323
In this room,
you do not ask questions.

41:56.767 --> 42:00.646
I ask them, you answer.

42:00.727 --> 42:05.243
If I am not satisfied
with your answers, you will die.

43:02.487 --> 43:03.476
