00:07.000 --> 00:08.576
<i>Last time, on "Superstition"...</i>

00:08.601 --> 00:10.616
<i>I've gone by many names.</i>

00:10.656 --> 00:12.640
- What are you?
- <i>The Dredge.</i>

00:12.665 --> 00:14.033
He's not gonna stop until he's dead.

00:14.034 --> 00:15.357
He knows Dad's weak spot.

00:17.569 --> 00:18.913
You're going on a date with Calvin.

00:18.938 --> 00:20.567
- No, it's not.
- Hookup, whatever you wanna call it.

00:20.568 --> 00:21.791
Definitely not a hookup.

00:21.816 --> 00:24.875
- You would have to be...
- 778 years old...

00:25.163 --> 00:26.621
To be exact.

01:56.275 --> 01:57.300
Mom!

01:58.205 --> 01:59.640
Mom, I'm home!

01:59.695 --> 02:01.453
Oh, God, she should not
be home right now!

02:01.478 --> 02:02.857
Go! Go, go, go! The closet, the closet!

02:02.882 --> 02:04.132
- The closet?
- The closet!

02:04.133 --> 02:06.799
Go! Go! Shit!

02:06.800 --> 02:08.809
Just go to the closet!

02:10.733 --> 02:12.238
Oh, my God!

02:16.180 --> 02:17.612
- So get this...
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.547
I told Mr. Preston
that Founder's Day was lame,

02:19.579 --> 02:21.478
because, I mean,
we're basically celebrating

02:21.479 --> 02:22.981
ripping off the Native Americans' land.

02:23.006 --> 02:24.236
- Uh-huh.
- And...

02:24.261 --> 02:27.560
The vengeful cretin made me
Social Chair of Founder's Day.

02:27.585 --> 02:28.997
Well, you know, if you...

02:29.021 --> 02:30.156
If you don't have anything nice to say,

02:30.203 --> 02:32.145
maybe you should just try
saying it vaguely.

02:32.146 --> 02:34.445
Maybe do something
with your photography.

02:34.652 --> 02:35.951
It's inside out.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.184
- What?
- Your T-shirt, it's inside out.

02:40.246 --> 02:43.845
I was just about
to go and take a shower.

02:47.687 --> 02:49.655
Right.

02:50.234 --> 02:54.231
Well, I'm gonna let you get back
to whatever it is you were doing.

02:56.146 --> 02:57.911
Calvin?

02:59.660 --> 03:02.009
You can come out now, playboy.

03:12.933 --> 03:15.052
You can come out now!

03:15.791 --> 03:16.923
That went well.

03:17.020 --> 03:19.045
This is completely crazy.

03:19.046 --> 03:20.924
- Yeah, not a good look.
- No, it's not.

03:20.949 --> 03:22.146
Our daughter seeing us like this

03:22.171 --> 03:23.408
and we don't even know what this is.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.154
I'm usually much better
about shielding her

03:25.179 --> 03:27.837
from my private life, thank you.
My... I... I can't.

03:27.862 --> 03:29.411
Yeah, I understand.

03:29.412 --> 03:31.096
No. No, you don't.

03:31.121 --> 03:32.938
Neither does she. Neither do I.

03:33.089 --> 03:36.078
Yes, we are very good together still,

03:36.079 --> 03:38.136
but that... Stop looking at me!

03:38.161 --> 03:40.478
That's not enough.

03:40.479 --> 03:42.693
It's close.

03:43.546 --> 03:46.328
Come on. Been a father two months.

03:46.603 --> 03:48.320
No one's ready for this,
but here we are.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.320
I can't do this.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.757
Can't do this with me?

03:52.946 --> 03:55.387
You left your life here once before.

03:56.218 --> 03:58.225
Protecting Garvey
is my number one priority.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.278
As a parent, I'm sure,
you understand that.

04:05.259 --> 04:06.871
Chief Westbrook.

04:10.046 --> 04:12.211
The Mayor wants me
to represent the department.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.926
Yeah, sure.

04:15.251 --> 04:17.716
Yeah, happy Founder's Day to you, too.

04:18.140 --> 04:20.940
Something... Excuse me.

04:22.046 --> 04:24.874
You let yourself out.

04:37.472 --> 04:39.386
Way to go, Calvin.

04:40.394 --> 04:45.295

04:48.032 --> 04:49.674
Ça va, chérie?

04:51.817 --> 04:54.254
Qu'est-ce que tu fais?

04:54.897 --> 04:56.911
Mmm.

04:56.912 --> 05:00.151
I missed you. I missed you.

05:00.238 --> 05:02.245
Good, you're back.
You're back, you're okay?

05:02.270 --> 05:04.178
- I'm good.
- You look good.

05:04.246 --> 05:06.187
- You look good.
- I feel good.

05:06.212 --> 05:07.545
Okay, well, let me be the judge of that.

05:07.546 --> 05:10.045
- Oh, come on.
- Ah. Okay.

05:10.528 --> 05:12.135
Mmm-hmm.

05:14.955 --> 05:16.758
You're healed.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.329
Healed.

05:20.879 --> 05:22.578
Oh, you're back just in time
to sample two

05:22.579 --> 05:25.355
of my latest healing oils.

05:26.412 --> 05:28.427
Um...

05:29.679 --> 05:33.014
- Aloe-lavender.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:34.966 --> 05:36.386
Mmm-hmm.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.921
Versus...

05:39.446 --> 05:42.541
Roasted cinnamon,

05:42.675 --> 05:45.411
infused with vitamin E.

05:45.675 --> 05:48.710
- Mmm.
- All edible.

05:49.027 --> 05:50.940
Organic.

05:51.591 --> 05:54.170
Oh, from your secret garden.

05:54.346 --> 05:56.948
Yes, my secret garden.

05:57.027 --> 05:59.334
Come here.

06:00.879 --> 06:02.706
I'm gonna bring everyone
up to speed later,

06:02.731 --> 06:04.811
on my travels and The Dredge.

06:05.212 --> 06:08.009
I just wanted a moment alone with you.

06:09.124 --> 06:10.565
How you holding up?

06:11.296 --> 06:13.113
Oh, Calvin meeting James.

06:13.288 --> 06:14.929
That was challenging.

06:15.011 --> 06:16.685
For Calvin, or for you?

06:16.781 --> 06:18.464
Both.

06:19.416 --> 06:21.942
Wish I'd known James was coming.

06:22.562 --> 06:25.179
I feel like he's angling for something.

06:25.884 --> 06:29.437
Not to mention, he seems to know
you better than anyone else.

06:29.612 --> 06:31.255
James and I have history.

06:31.574 --> 06:33.840
He can be helpful under
the right circumstances.

06:34.064 --> 06:35.866
Things were moving fast.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.717
I needed someone to keep an eye
on my family in my absence.

06:40.654 --> 06:42.917
James is at his best
when he feels needed.

06:43.196 --> 06:44.495
What about our son?

06:44.781 --> 06:46.244
Calvin?

06:48.030 --> 06:51.324
- Calvin.
- Calvin has been doing a great job.

06:53.615 --> 06:55.977
But this is a marathon of sprints.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.652
Are we really sure that he's
ready to train for this?

06:59.724 --> 07:01.106
For what we do, Bea?

07:01.721 --> 07:03.298
Hmm?

07:03.570 --> 07:05.658
And if he's not

07:06.074 --> 07:08.206
and something were to happen to him...

07:08.642 --> 07:11.028
What then?

07:12.782 --> 07:14.516
Either way...

07:14.798 --> 07:16.873
He needs you to talk to him.

07:17.548 --> 07:18.853
I mean, he has...

07:19.052 --> 07:20.843
He has a lot of questions.

07:20.922 --> 07:22.540
It's not fair to shut him out.

07:22.906 --> 07:25.116
I'll answer any question he has.

07:25.256 --> 07:27.169
But it's gotta come from him.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.089
- He's a grown-ass man.
- Yes, he is.

07:30.399 --> 07:32.197
Hmm.

07:34.725 --> 07:36.406
Left side.

07:36.621 --> 07:38.643
The lavender shea?
That's the lavender shea?

07:38.668 --> 07:40.048
- That's lavender.
- That's good stuff.

07:40.073 --> 07:42.461
Come here. I want to show you something.

07:47.243 --> 07:49.073
- Look in the mirror.
- Yeah.

07:49.267 --> 07:52.275
- Do you see that queen in the mirror?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.823
That's you, Bea.

07:57.121 --> 07:59.386
No one has ever...

07:59.855 --> 08:02.442
Ever known me like you, my queen.

08:04.394 --> 08:06.426
And no one ever will.

08:09.682 --> 08:12.634
The Dredge followed me out of
La Rochelle, just as planned.

08:12.878 --> 08:16.056
But after a couple of weeks, I realized
he wasn't tracking me anymore.

08:16.130 --> 08:18.461
So he could be anywhere?

08:20.280 --> 08:21.943
I think he's back here.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.944
Which means he's after more
than just me.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.554
May, what did you find out?

08:27.579 --> 08:30.769
Uh, this guy is a land
developer out of Louisiana.

08:30.794 --> 08:33.078
- He went missing a while back.
- Tilly?

08:33.102 --> 08:34.658
This is different
than other possessions.

08:34.683 --> 08:37.626
He's not merely a spirit
inhabiting a host

08:37.652 --> 08:39.089
and then moving on.

08:39.136 --> 08:40.769
Meaning what?

08:40.842 --> 08:43.308
Meaning The Dredge
left this poor guy for dead.

08:43.309 --> 08:45.576
Used him like a meat suit.

08:45.577 --> 08:48.433
It would take a large toll
on the man's body, so,

08:48.536 --> 08:51.054
if anything, there'd be some
sort of signature left behind.

08:51.084 --> 08:52.211
Like a fingerprint.

08:52.235 --> 08:54.309
Exactly. If I can find that,

08:54.310 --> 08:56.432
we can know a lot more about The Dredge.

08:56.638 --> 08:58.478
You said part of your mission
was to find a weapon

08:58.503 --> 08:59.978
to help beat The Dredge.

09:00.003 --> 09:02.472
Any luck with that?

09:02.794 --> 09:05.227
I found a couple of things, son.

09:05.777 --> 09:08.040
Whether they work or not
remains to be seen.

09:08.111 --> 09:09.786
Great.

09:09.857 --> 09:11.650
So if you're right
and The Dredge is back here,

09:11.737 --> 09:13.951
he could be inhabiting anyone.

09:14.706 --> 09:17.119
Even one of us.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.676
The surgery was supposed to
be a routine appendectomy,

09:20.677 --> 09:22.809
instead I got a
peek-and-shriek, so heads up.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.942
Running late.

09:25.577 --> 09:27.276
Dr. Kim!

09:27.822 --> 09:30.142
- You forgot something.
- What?

09:30.924 --> 09:32.425
This.

09:48.451 --> 09:50.713
See you tomorrow!

10:15.096 --> 10:16.510
Now...

10:16.605 --> 10:18.828
Where are the Hastings?

10:30.077 --> 10:32.508
We're closed!

10:35.110 --> 10:36.876
Who are you?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.442
And what do you want?

10:43.731 --> 10:45.727
A new face.

10:47.235 --> 10:49.894
Same dark soul.

10:51.434 --> 10:53.391
You got something for me?

10:54.778 --> 10:58.525
Reflected in this, you can see
stories from around the globe.

11:00.129 --> 11:02.018
And?

11:03.556 --> 11:05.890
A deal's a deal.

11:35.493 --> 11:37.455
You were right to be curious.

11:37.628 --> 11:40.676
I believe that is the
Ring of Solomon, himself.

11:40.945 --> 11:44.267
You've been searching for that
ring for a long time, haven't you?

11:44.386 --> 11:47.809
Could it be that the ones you
seek are trapped within it?

11:48.204 --> 11:50.934
Where is Isaac Hastings now?

11:52.277 --> 11:55.196
That was not part of our bargain.

11:55.569 --> 11:59.212
Our business is concluded.

12:21.931 --> 12:24.109
Souvenirs from your trip?

12:25.197 --> 12:26.492
Yeah.

12:26.977 --> 12:29.818
The Dredge is out there.
We gotta be ready.

12:34.994 --> 12:37.091
Got a lot on your mind, huh?

12:37.980 --> 12:39.893
That's an understatement.

12:43.313 --> 12:45.404
All these years, you let me
believe you were

12:45.436 --> 12:47.619
responsible for Arlo's death. Why?

12:50.177 --> 12:52.541
You do what you can
to protect your family, son.

12:53.429 --> 12:54.797
Really?

12:55.139 --> 12:57.591
Is that what you're doing?
Protecting us?

12:58.977 --> 13:02.329
Are you sure we aren't
some expendable soldiers

13:02.369 --> 13:05.209
to be used in your private army?

13:07.581 --> 13:10.113
This isn't a private war, son.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.844
I didn't ask for this shit.

13:14.219 --> 13:17.254
How many other families
have you had before us?

13:17.866 --> 13:21.308
How many other wives and kids
died fighting by your side?

13:24.103 --> 13:26.119
Far too many.

13:29.777 --> 13:31.886
You're my own father
and I don't even know you.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.529
How long has this fight been going on?

13:34.624 --> 13:35.789
And why do you do it?

13:35.854 --> 13:38.329
- And what's the story with James?
- Calvin.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.803
Why do you choose to train

13:41.859 --> 13:43.458
and trust him and not me?

13:43.494 --> 13:45.552
You made a decision
when you left here, son.

13:45.962 --> 13:48.732
If you stayed, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

13:48.788 --> 13:50.279
Now, you're asking questions.

13:50.738 --> 13:52.353
Good questions, son.

13:52.509 --> 13:55.430
But be sure you really
wanna know the answers.

13:56.398 --> 14:00.399
Because knowing places you in jeopardy.

14:00.624 --> 14:02.862
So what do you really want?

14:03.623 --> 14:06.466
I want the truth.

14:13.006 --> 14:14.809
Nothing remarkable thus far.

14:14.872 --> 14:18.634
Removing skull cap now... Whoa.

14:23.872 --> 14:25.556
Seems like there's some kind of

14:25.658 --> 14:29.472
dark tentacles covering up
the frontal lobes.

14:35.390 --> 14:37.176
Gross.

14:37.438 --> 14:39.819
Founder's Day has
always been very important

14:39.859 --> 14:41.787
to La Rochelle.

14:42.176 --> 14:43.985
- Uh, Chief Westbrook
- Sorry.

14:44.088 --> 14:46.969
is here to address the security concerns

14:47.033 --> 14:49.548
for our Founder's Day festivities.

14:49.573 --> 14:51.694
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

14:51.719 --> 14:55.462
The Ladies' Bridge and Pie-Baking Club

14:55.581 --> 14:57.184
requests a booth.

14:57.351 --> 15:00.573
- All in favor, say aye.
- Aye.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.518
Peter's Peanuts also requests a booth.

15:04.543 --> 15:06.161
All in favor, say aye.

15:06.201 --> 15:07.947
Aye.

15:11.712 --> 15:14.333
- All in favor, say aye.
- Aye.

15:14.412 --> 15:17.832
Mrs. Beatrice Hastings
has requested a booth

15:17.888 --> 15:21.009
to display her new line
of Bea's Butters.

15:21.010 --> 15:23.709
Um, the Hastings have never
really been a part of this.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.165
She probably uses the fat
from the dead bodies

15:26.190 --> 15:27.641
to make the body butter.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.249
Yeah, like in Fight Club.

15:29.281 --> 15:32.518
We've all heard the rumors.

15:32.543 --> 15:35.769
I saw why take the chance
on scaring folks away?

15:35.794 --> 15:37.242
It'll hurt our business.

15:37.243 --> 15:39.944
The Hastings family
has been very good to us.

15:39.969 --> 15:41.664
Spencer, man!

15:41.689 --> 15:43.851
You live right next door
to the Hastings.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.907
You just don't want them to find
out you voted against them.

15:46.973 --> 15:49.082
They'll put a voodoo
hurting on your ass.

15:49.107 --> 15:50.876
Okay, folks, listen up.

15:50.901 --> 15:52.328
Please.

15:52.353 --> 15:55.450
The rules that you all
swore to uphold are very clear.

15:55.529 --> 15:56.996
As long as they pay their deposit

15:57.021 --> 15:58.711
and uphold the regulations,
they are granted a booth.

15:58.736 --> 16:00.151
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.217
Thank you. Sir.

16:01.242 --> 16:03.652
The oral vote is strictly ceremonial.

16:03.677 --> 16:06.814
Unless you can prove that the
applicant has broken a law

16:06.839 --> 16:08.674
or is otherwise unfit to participate,

16:08.675 --> 16:10.473
it's really quite simple.

16:10.655 --> 16:12.321
Josephina Wainwright.

16:12.442 --> 16:14.965
She died on my operating table.

16:16.386 --> 16:18.007
Her son Trevor was away at med school.

16:18.008 --> 16:20.078
When he found out, he was heartbroken.

16:20.498 --> 16:23.015
He was gonna drop out
and use the tuition money

16:23.075 --> 16:24.634
to pay for her funeral.

16:25.015 --> 16:27.544
And that's when I called
the Hastings family.

16:28.372 --> 16:31.211
They gave her a lovely burial.

16:31.465 --> 16:33.766
And when it came time for payment,
you know what they told Trevor?

16:33.854 --> 16:35.735
"Go become a doctor,

16:35.775 --> 16:37.934
like Josephina prayed for.

16:38.142 --> 16:40.187
Go help folks out and help others out,

16:40.212 --> 16:42.133
whether they have money or not.

16:42.287 --> 16:44.619
And that will be payment enough for us."

16:44.851 --> 16:47.117
I mean, look where we are.

16:47.142 --> 16:49.382
What would Jesus do?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.009
Last week, I saw a bunch of college kids

16:52.034 --> 16:53.611
taking pictures of the Hastings house

16:53.636 --> 16:56.141
just because it's creepy
and they read about it online.

16:56.142 --> 16:57.957
Hell, um...

16:58.027 --> 17:00.026
La Rochelle sure could use tourism.

17:01.098 --> 17:02.608
And, um...

17:02.697 --> 17:04.695
I guess we could use
all the help we can get.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.340
- Hmm.
- All right.

17:07.342 --> 17:08.607
Let's get this vote over with

17:08.608 --> 17:10.395
and break for lunch.

17:10.519 --> 17:13.903
All in favor of
the Hastings booth, say aye.

17:14.041 --> 17:15.513
Aye.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.880
- All opposed, say...
- Nay.

17:17.974 --> 17:19.512
Come on, honey.

17:25.901 --> 17:27.731
Thank you so much for the kind words.

17:27.756 --> 17:28.859
Sure.

17:28.884 --> 17:31.946
I don't ever recall hearing you
speak up like that before.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.874
Oh, there's a lot about me
you don't know.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.907
How about you let me
catch you up over lunch?

17:35.932 --> 17:37.749
Yeah.

17:41.364 --> 17:45.000
All right. This is a memory crystal.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.019
Now...

17:47.108 --> 17:49.071
In the theory of reincarnation,

17:49.262 --> 17:51.746
every time someone is born again,

17:52.022 --> 17:54.858
they have no recollection
of their past life

17:55.225 --> 17:58.604
and this enables them
to start fresh each time.

17:59.464 --> 18:01.652
You're saying you believe
in reincarnation?

18:01.953 --> 18:04.007
I'm saying that when
you live as long as I do

18:04.008 --> 18:05.541
you have to have a place
to store your memories,

18:05.542 --> 18:07.450
or you'll overload.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.521
The human brain can only hold so much

18:09.675 --> 18:11.712
Put that around your waist. Strap it up.

18:12.101 --> 18:14.503
Now, when was the last time you ate?

18:15.075 --> 18:17.329
Breakfast, why?

18:17.813 --> 18:20.041
As a kid, you used to have
a sensitive stomach.

18:20.042 --> 18:22.345
Everyone reacts differently.

18:22.708 --> 18:25.307
- I think my tummy will be just fine.
- Oh, that's good.

18:25.382 --> 18:28.287
Tough guy, put two drops in each eye.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.556
That's right, it's blue. Put it in.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.341
All right.

18:35.437 --> 18:38.390
The eyewear stays on at all times.

18:38.713 --> 18:41.217
It's gonna be like looking into
the sun to the second power.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.189
Take it.

18:43.578 --> 18:45.241
You may feel some pain
in your frontal lobe.

18:45.242 --> 18:46.841
It's like a brain freeze on steroids.

18:46.842 --> 18:48.903
That's normal. Also, some nausea.

18:48.987 --> 18:51.753
That's also normal.
Anything else is not.

18:51.861 --> 18:53.727
If it gets too... You listening to me?

18:53.975 --> 18:55.641
If it gets too intense in there,

18:55.642 --> 18:56.707
I'll be right there with you.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.774
Call me. I'll take us out.

18:58.775 --> 19:01.162
We're good.

19:19.204 --> 19:20.474
Ah, shit!

19:20.475 --> 19:23.250
It'll pass! Stay with it!

19:24.694 --> 19:26.122
All right.

19:26.147 --> 19:27.638
We're good. What do you see?

19:27.663 --> 19:29.507
Blinding light.

19:29.508 --> 19:31.447
Then we're in.

19:32.140 --> 19:34.506
Slow it down.
Take deep rhythmic breaths.

19:34.642 --> 19:36.392
Slow it down.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.122
There you go, son.

19:38.296 --> 19:40.524
Walk it through.

19:44.842 --> 19:46.574
What's that?

19:46.575 --> 19:49.061
That's my mother, Nunu.

19:49.142 --> 19:51.291
- That's my grandmother?
- Yeah.

19:51.408 --> 19:54.283
She's beautiful, isn't she?

19:54.346 --> 19:56.989
Yeah. Okay.

19:57.061 --> 19:58.497
We don't have that much time.

19:58.569 --> 20:00.941
I'm gonna jump you forward.

20:18.742 --> 20:20.774
Time is fleeting.

20:20.799 --> 20:24.182
The demons grow stronger
and more cunning every day.

20:24.742 --> 20:26.800
We will only be able to choose one.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.571
But the responsibility...

20:28.608 --> 20:30.907
It is too great for one man.

20:31.015 --> 20:33.317
We have no choice.

20:33.318 --> 20:35.850
He must be the best among us.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.674
It will be a great honor.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.947
Yes.

20:40.349 --> 20:42.027
What about your son?

20:42.170 --> 20:43.574
No.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.922
His place is here in the Caliphate.

20:47.575 --> 20:49.033
Who is our best warrior?

20:49.097 --> 20:52.372
The best amongst us... is Razan.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.944
We have a few strong ones.

20:56.093 --> 20:58.398
But the most gifted and wise.

20:58.732 --> 21:00.288
It is Razan.

21:03.590 --> 21:06.350
Hmm, you know, you mustn't
put anything on your skin,

21:06.375 --> 21:07.741
you wouldn't put in your mouth

21:07.742 --> 21:10.748
because we absorb everything. Hmm?

21:12.161 --> 21:15.986
You. You know, what karma is but
do you know what dharma means?

21:16.273 --> 21:19.891
- No.
- Dharma is one's life purpose.

21:20.508 --> 21:22.174
Making a living doing what you love

21:22.175 --> 21:24.509
is one of the secrets
to a well lived life.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.176
So your life's purpose is
putting make up on dead people

21:27.215 --> 21:29.406
and skin cream on the living.

21:29.842 --> 21:33.453
There is no better purpose
than the service of others.

21:33.620 --> 21:36.274
I probably could have
been a preacher too. Hmm?

21:36.771 --> 21:39.676
Okay. Why the sourpuss?

21:39.908 --> 21:42.241
What's wrong, honey?

21:42.242 --> 21:44.841
I caught them.

21:45.281 --> 21:48.492
My mom and Calvin.
I caught them having sex.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.088
It's just like, it's not like
they know each other, you know.

21:52.167 --> 21:53.821
Like...

21:54.179 --> 21:57.512
My mom doesn't do this.
She just doesn't bring guys home.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.051
Okay, we are all just children, Garvey.

22:01.107 --> 22:04.017
We're all just works in progress

22:04.042 --> 22:05.807
or we wouldn't be here on this earth

22:05.992 --> 22:08.007
struggling to make it right.

22:08.603 --> 22:11.500
Okay, well, just keep it real.

22:12.751 --> 22:15.940
Maybe they were just being
horny and stupid.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.256
Or maybe they are really into each other

22:18.415 --> 22:20.289
and are trying to figure it out.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.630
Hopefully without hurting you

22:22.709 --> 22:25.455
or themselves too much in the process.

22:27.477 --> 22:29.198
Look, can you just not tell
my mom I said anything.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.913
No, I won't.

22:31.123 --> 22:33.088
But you should talk to her.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.326
Yeah?

22:36.508 --> 22:39.241
Okay. Come, let us get
some more flowers then.

22:39.242 --> 22:41.826
What do you think? More rose, hmm?

22:43.056 --> 22:46.017
So the Templars and the Moors
are the secret meaning.

22:46.042 --> 22:49.511
Nothing unites people
like the common enemy, son.

23:06.328 --> 23:08.742
Sir Isaac Razan...

23:09.370 --> 23:12.497
Please stand.

23:33.589 --> 23:35.567
From this time forward,

23:36.312 --> 23:38.312
you shall know not death.

23:39.175 --> 23:42.724
We owe our allegiance to you.

23:43.399 --> 23:45.954
Lead the way.

23:50.042 --> 23:52.752
This is when you became immortal.

23:53.051 --> 23:56.193
You were chosen to keep the
balance between good and evil.

23:57.010 --> 24:00.799
That's an over simplification, but yes.

24:07.427 --> 24:09.206
All rise.

24:20.552 --> 24:22.481
Teach me.

24:26.555 --> 24:28.517
So, what's the big news?

24:29.152 --> 24:31.464
I rigged up a customized Geiger-counter.

24:31.489 --> 24:34.955
It measures ionized radiation like
Beta and Gama rays, anyway...

24:35.075 --> 24:36.928
Even though he's dead,

24:37.164 --> 24:38.920
his body is still emitting

24:38.991 --> 24:42.079
unusually high levels
of Hawking radiation.

24:42.308 --> 24:44.697
Hawking, as in Stephen
Hawking, the physicist?

24:44.722 --> 24:46.436
Exactly.

24:46.793 --> 24:49.119
It's kinda like a black hole, right?

24:49.246 --> 24:51.698
It... It absorbs all the light around it.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.952
Whoa!

24:55.833 --> 24:57.234
Wait...

24:57.512 --> 25:00.115
So if he is radio active,
we can locate him.

25:00.195 --> 25:01.980
And we can figure out who he is now.

25:02.246 --> 25:03.879
So how's your head feeling?

25:04.121 --> 25:05.861
It took a pretty nasty hit.

25:05.955 --> 25:07.507
You didn't take much time off, did you?

25:07.508 --> 25:10.065
Ah, well, you know I've always
been a little hard-headed.

25:11.908 --> 25:14.007
- I'm not gonna respond to that.
- Smart.

25:14.245 --> 25:15.678
But since you went there.

25:15.703 --> 25:17.537
You remember the time
at the old movie theater?

25:17.894 --> 25:19.489
I do.

25:19.708 --> 25:21.806
I do. When I stood up and accidentally

25:21.830 --> 25:23.456
head-butted that poor lady's drink

25:23.481 --> 25:25.399
- all over the place.
- Uh-huh.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.151
And your linebacker boyfriend
decided to take it out on me.

25:28.176 --> 25:29.612
Mmm-hmm.

25:29.637 --> 25:31.891
- Guess what?
- What?

25:32.075 --> 25:35.742
- I'm operating on him next week.
- Really?

25:38.290 --> 25:41.631
Wow. Life has some twists
and turns to it, doesn't it?

25:41.806 --> 25:43.878
It sure does.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.607
You know, I never get
to tell you how amazing,

25:46.608 --> 25:49.871
I mean, how you juggle at
home being a single mother.

25:50.308 --> 25:51.807
Getting through police academy.

25:52.077 --> 25:53.835
You've done well.

25:55.965 --> 25:57.764
Have I?

25:59.225 --> 26:00.971
Sometimes I wonder.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.250
What's going on? Come on.

26:04.552 --> 26:06.184
I know you.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.082
You can't trust your doctor,
who can you trust?

26:09.875 --> 26:11.175
I just know there's a difference

26:11.200 --> 26:14.653
between doing it all and doing it well.

26:14.942 --> 26:17.423
Is this about your daughter?

26:17.539 --> 26:19.598
You were always
very protective about her.

26:19.694 --> 26:21.567
Yeah.

26:22.375 --> 26:25.768
And an old boyfriend
has come back into town.

26:26.075 --> 26:28.363
We've been seeing a lot of
each other and it's just...

26:29.047 --> 26:30.926
Everything just got really complicated

26:31.013 --> 26:33.673
and I don't do complicated well.

26:34.008 --> 26:36.096
You care about him, don't you?

26:37.690 --> 26:41.414
Is this the same guy, your first love?

26:43.438 --> 26:45.637
I remember when you
used to talk about him...

26:46.033 --> 26:47.924
Used to make me a little jealous.

26:50.136 --> 26:53.240
He's the one that got away
and broke your heart.

26:56.264 --> 26:58.492
I'm sorry.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.306
That ring contains the legions of demons

27:06.331 --> 27:07.867
I have caught over the centuries.

27:07.908 --> 27:10.642
I need you to hear their voices.
I need you to concentrate.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.610
This Obi-Wan bullshit ain't working.

27:12.635 --> 27:14.221
Did you have sex recently?

27:14.246 --> 27:15.824
- What?
- You heard me.

27:15.849 --> 27:17.554
It's a big exchange of energy.

27:17.579 --> 27:20.117
There's a reason why boxers
don't do it before a fight.

27:20.570 --> 27:22.248
Who was she?

27:22.408 --> 27:24.606
What the hell
is this Dr. Phil shit, man?

27:24.653 --> 27:26.701
May. Okay.

27:26.804 --> 27:29.041
See, now May is a good
vibration match for you, son.

27:29.066 --> 27:31.376
Which means you should be
strong, no excuses.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.947
Because good lovin' makes
a man strong, see.

27:33.972 --> 27:36.138
Bea... Bea keeps me right and...

27:36.139 --> 27:37.964
The last thing I wanna hear about
is you talking about...

27:37.989 --> 27:39.035
Then focus.

27:39.036 --> 27:41.158
Show me I'm not wasting my time.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.641
Straight on. Right between the trees.

27:50.304 --> 27:51.783
You hearing something?

27:51.867 --> 27:53.915
<i>Don't fall for his trickery, baby.</i>

27:54.090 --> 27:55.174
Hey, who's there?

27:55.175 --> 27:57.528
<i>You left Arlo here burning in hell.</i>

27:57.567 --> 27:59.352
- Ma?
- <i>And your daughter's not...</i>

27:59.377 --> 28:00.383
Garvey?

28:00.408 --> 28:04.041
<i>Razan doesn't give a shit about you, boy.
You're a failure.</i>

28:04.144 --> 28:06.153
<i>You can't die. You can't die.</i>

28:07.142 --> 28:08.715
Harness them.
Don't let them control you.

28:10.608 --> 28:12.341
Harness them, Calvin.

28:12.342 --> 28:15.582
<i>Many have died following him.</i>

28:16.368 --> 28:18.720
He's right, isn't he?

28:18.826 --> 28:21.207
As soon as I'm dead, you'll start over.

28:21.296 --> 28:22.761
Careful, son.

28:22.792 --> 28:24.574
I taught you everything you know,

28:25.264 --> 28:26.754
and everything I don't.

28:35.533 --> 28:38.573
That's right. Don't let them
turn you against me.

28:38.685 --> 28:40.646
Oh, you don't want to come for me, son.

28:40.775 --> 28:42.741
You ain't ready to come for me now.

28:43.011 --> 28:45.235
You look a little soft.

28:48.142 --> 28:50.560
You all right, son? Come on.

28:50.914 --> 28:53.574
Son, don't let them...

28:55.603 --> 28:57.102
That's it, get it out.

28:57.204 --> 28:59.791
Get it out. Don't gas out now.

29:00.783 --> 29:02.862
All right.

29:05.561 --> 29:06.726
Huh?

29:09.799 --> 29:11.941
You have to harness them, son.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.961
Let it out. Do it.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.059
Let it out.

29:21.496 --> 29:24.348
- Let it go, son.
- I left because I hate you.

29:24.442 --> 29:27.166
I know. Better you hate me
than hate yourself.

29:27.212 --> 29:29.276
- I killed my own brother.
- No, no, no.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.150
- I killed my own brother.
- Calvin! Look at me. No.

29:31.197 --> 29:34.187
An infernal did that. You did not.

29:34.906 --> 29:39.020
Now listen, I ran away from all
this fight stuff many times.

29:39.174 --> 29:40.506
It didn't work for me.

29:40.599 --> 29:42.165
You're not tasked for this.

29:42.190 --> 29:44.102
This does not have to be your destiny.

29:44.309 --> 29:46.031
You don't have to stay here

29:46.079 --> 29:47.883
and protect me from death honestly.

29:48.317 --> 29:50.654
I've been doing this shit
for hundreds of years.

29:50.812 --> 29:53.495
I'm good, but I want you
to know something.

29:54.701 --> 29:58.520
I would do whatever I can, as
your father, to protect you.

29:58.908 --> 30:02.385
Even if it meant being the villain
in your life for a while.

30:05.861 --> 30:07.482
You knew.

30:08.342 --> 30:10.465
You knew those voices
would get to me, didn't you?

30:10.490 --> 30:12.443
I thought they might.

30:13.608 --> 30:17.287
You cannot overcome the
voices of fear and deception

30:17.351 --> 30:19.335
if you can't acknowledge the existence.

30:19.716 --> 30:21.922
Now you're starting to understand
the power of that ring.

30:22.009 --> 30:24.902
You're starting
to understand the battle.

30:27.542 --> 30:29.950
It's more than I could have imagined.

30:31.342 --> 30:32.941
I don't even know if I'm ready for this.

30:33.291 --> 30:35.112
I didn't know if I was ready.

30:36.787 --> 30:41.796
But if you ever are, Calvin,
I'm here for you, to train you.

30:45.471 --> 30:48.182
You sayin' you'll teach me? Everything?

30:48.636 --> 30:52.120
The crystals, the freaky
weaponry, the ring.

30:52.413 --> 30:54.612
We be stopping demon-ass together.

30:55.572 --> 30:56.980
Father and son.

30:57.005 --> 30:59.465
Whooping some demon ass.

31:01.997 --> 31:03.925
There's no time like the present, Pop.

31:04.854 --> 31:07.497
- Just get me ready.
- Sure.

31:08.496 --> 31:10.275
I'm in.

31:29.504 --> 31:32.067
Carol, I think I'm just going to get
the vegan burger to go.

31:46.837 --> 31:50.424
What a surprise! Mom, Dr. Kim.

31:50.488 --> 31:52.044
Garvey?

31:52.175 --> 31:54.479
We... We just saw each other
at the Founder's Day meeting

31:54.504 --> 31:56.613
and decided to do some
catching up over lunch.

31:56.716 --> 31:59.073
Sit down. Join us.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.937
You know, I would, but
I don't want to interrupt.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.314
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, you can have a seat.

32:05.338 --> 32:06.336
Okay.

32:06.361 --> 32:08.654
You can order that meat ball sub
you love with the extra sauce.

32:08.679 --> 32:10.963
Thanks, Mom, but remember,
I'm vegan now.

32:10.988 --> 32:12.678
No dead animal flesh for me.

32:13.118 --> 32:16.030
Oh, I'm vegan in between meals.

32:17.660 --> 32:19.259
Oh, I've got to take this.

32:19.284 --> 32:21.765
Um, and stop at the ladies' room.

32:21.942 --> 32:24.829
We'll be right here,
gossiping about you.

32:24.892 --> 32:26.686
Great.

32:36.754 --> 32:39.753
Well, you're what, a junior
in high school now?

32:39.945 --> 32:41.548
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:41.596 --> 32:43.076
So you thinking about colleges?

32:43.077 --> 32:45.442
Yep. Trying to get out of this town.

32:45.821 --> 32:48.218
I said the same thing.

32:48.431 --> 32:50.810
But there's something
about this town that's...

32:51.230 --> 32:53.138
drawing people back.

32:54.178 --> 32:56.570
I left and...

32:57.061 --> 32:59.061
here I am now, back again.

33:00.269 --> 33:01.991
Seems to be happening a lot lately.

33:02.102 --> 33:04.102
Must be an epidemic or something.

33:04.643 --> 33:06.925
You're talking about your
mom's old boyfriend?

33:15.179 --> 33:17.048
She told you about Calvin?

33:17.906 --> 33:20.683
Well, I'm her doctor.
I'm sworn to secrecy.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.976
Honestly, I don't really
know him that well.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.105
And?

33:28.482 --> 33:29.966
And...

33:30.377 --> 33:33.146
I don't know if I can trust him.

33:33.654 --> 33:35.276
Just because someone's
your biological father

33:35.277 --> 33:38.242
doesn't... Doesn't make him
your dad, you know.

33:38.384 --> 33:41.274
Calvin Hastings is your father?

33:43.131 --> 33:46.946
He really wasn't there very much
for you growing up now, was he?

33:50.517 --> 33:54.023
All right, now that you know
how powerful the voice is,

33:54.024 --> 33:56.540
of deceit and hate can be
as a collective,

33:56.802 --> 33:58.951
I want you to master them individually.

33:59.127 --> 34:01.076
Yes, they are gonna shit talk.

34:01.151 --> 34:03.352
But as long as you don't
give them power,

34:03.463 --> 34:06.321
you're gonna stay in command.
Focus, right here.

34:12.571 --> 34:14.080
Good.

34:14.215 --> 34:18.715
Remember, these infernals are
imprisoned in this ring for a reason.

34:19.143 --> 34:21.813
I want you to call forth
the specific infernal,

34:21.839 --> 34:23.476
Skinny Jenkins.

34:23.657 --> 34:25.909
How will I recognize his voice?

34:25.982 --> 34:28.054
He's an old-school
shit talker from Harlem.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.771
You'll recognize him.

34:33.168 --> 34:36.565
I've got nothing but time
on my hands, baby.

34:39.628 --> 34:41.839
Bring him forward, son.

34:52.514 --> 34:54.481
It's not working.

34:54.639 --> 34:55.743
Look behind you.

35:01.962 --> 35:04.795
<i>Templar Negros.</i>

35:04.855 --> 35:06.664
<i>Ain't this some shit.</i>

35:17.455 --> 35:19.108
<i>Isaac Razan...</i>

35:19.276 --> 35:22.840
<i>still as ugly as dog shit on new shoes.</i>

35:22.943 --> 35:24.436
<i>Let me guess.</i>

35:24.499 --> 35:28.356
<i>This little bitch-ass negro
is another piece of rot</i>

35:28.428 --> 35:30.823
<i>from your undying family tree.</i>

35:33.677 --> 35:37.200
This is my son who you're
going to answer to.

35:37.350 --> 35:38.628
<i>You sure he ready?</i>

35:38.922 --> 35:41.486
<i>He look a little soft to me.</i>

35:42.452 --> 35:46.550
<i>But I'm sure you got him all
trained up just like the others.</i>

35:47.668 --> 35:50.679
This one's a player.
Don't let him game you.

35:50.893 --> 35:54.504
- What did he do?
- <i>Nothing to deserve this.</i>

35:54.925 --> 35:57.589
<i>That boy is smart. Be careful, boy.</i>

35:57.676 --> 36:00.660
<i>Old Isaac don't like nobody
questioning his authority.</i>

36:00.819 --> 36:03.713
Drug dealer. So poisoned he can't see.

36:03.849 --> 36:06.412
<i>Now ain't that some
hypocritical bullshit there.</i>

36:06.475 --> 36:09.261
<i>You humans are poisoning the whole world</i>

36:09.324 --> 36:11.887
<i>with your pollution and greed.</i>

36:11.927 --> 36:13.466
<i>Brother Curtis Mayfield said,</i>

36:13.554 --> 36:16.863
<i>If there's a hell below,
y'all are gonna go.</i>

36:16.888 --> 36:19.609
<i>Niggers, crackers, police, stay backers,</i>

36:19.650 --> 36:23.522
<i>y'all want to dance with the devil
and kill in the name of God.</i>

36:23.547 --> 36:25.408
<i>But God don't love you no more.</i>

36:25.477 --> 36:27.534
<i>That's what all this crazy
weather is about.</i>

36:27.559 --> 36:29.251
<i>He trying to get rid of y'all.</i>

36:29.276 --> 36:30.508
<i>Armageddon is near.</i>

36:31.912 --> 36:34.101
<i>Smell like dead humans.</i>

36:34.164 --> 36:36.345
<i>Judgment day is coming.</i>

36:36.410 --> 36:39.964
<i>And unlike you, I got nothing
but time on my hands.</i>

36:40.877 --> 36:43.289
<i>Time on my hands.</i>

36:45.027 --> 36:48.220
Enough of this bullshit. Send him back.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.975
Skinny Jenkins, return to chamber.

36:55.969 --> 36:57.937
Say the exact words, son.

36:58.794 --> 37:02.782
Skinny Jenkins, prisoner
of the house of Razan,

37:04.193 --> 37:06.457
return to chamber.

37:06.643 --> 37:10.009
<i>I got nothing but time
on my hands, Isaac.</i>

37:10.071 --> 37:14.263
<i>I'll be back. I got nothing
but time on my hands...</i>

37:21.894 --> 37:25.315
Okay, I'm back. So you all can
stop gossiping about me now.

37:25.362 --> 37:27.204
Shh.

37:29.775 --> 37:31.994
Okay. My turn.

37:32.145 --> 37:33.883
Gonna check in with the hospital.

37:34.756 --> 37:36.547
Damn, phone is dead again.

37:36.572 --> 37:37.905
Oh, no, here, you can borrow mine.

37:37.986 --> 37:39.374
And take all the time you need.

37:39.399 --> 37:41.423
Garvey and I could really
use the time to catch up.

37:41.577 --> 37:43.892
- If it rings, I'll bring it right back.
- Thank you.

37:48.110 --> 37:49.977
Okay.

37:53.461 --> 37:55.755
I know this morning was confusing.

37:55.811 --> 37:57.653
- We don't have to talk about this.
- We... We do.

37:57.679 --> 38:02.310
Calvin and I have agreed to
figure us out before we involve you.

38:02.379 --> 38:04.008
What does that mean?

38:04.088 --> 38:06.520
That means its new for him,
it's new for me.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.511
We... We still don't have
all the answers, Garvey.

38:08.635 --> 38:10.978
Life has thrown us a curve ball

38:10.979 --> 38:13.048
and trust me, once you get a little
bit older, you will understand.

38:13.088 --> 38:14.607
- Really?
- Yes.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.469
I'm almost 17.

38:16.953 --> 38:18.961
I'm just a year younger
than when you had me.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.183
I'm still a virgin.

38:21.270 --> 38:23.801
With all due respect, Mom,
it's gonna stay that way,

38:23.991 --> 38:26.530
until I find someone who's
not gonna run out on me.

38:26.555 --> 38:28.063
Ever.

38:29.706 --> 38:31.044
He left without even saying goodbye

38:31.045 --> 38:32.411
and you're just gonna let him back in.

38:32.412 --> 38:35.159
Garvey, he didn't know anything
about you and that is on me.

38:36.279 --> 38:38.032
But it's not his fault.

38:38.389 --> 38:40.011
And what we are trying to do now

38:40.012 --> 38:43.011
is what we both feel is best for you.

38:43.012 --> 38:45.044
You have to believe that.
It's not selfishness...

38:45.045 --> 38:47.589
So please, just act like
everything is fine now.

38:48.256 --> 38:51.708
No. But you can at least
recognize the try.

38:52.478 --> 38:54.957
You didn't even tell him about me.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.887
I grew up without a father for 16 years.

38:58.912 --> 39:00.978
I didn't have a choice.

39:00.979 --> 39:02.544
You didn't give him an option.

39:02.545 --> 39:04.144
And maybe he would
have left, I don't know.

39:04.145 --> 39:06.118
But that option should have been there.

39:06.721 --> 39:10.483
Of course. I never...

39:11.507 --> 39:14.899
I never intended for him not
to be in your life, Garvey.

39:15.218 --> 39:19.129
But don't let my mistakes turn
you into this tough cookie.

39:19.245 --> 39:21.708
Tough does not age well.

39:22.579 --> 39:26.643
Tough breaks, flexible bends.

39:35.380 --> 39:37.000
Dr. Kim?

39:37.145 --> 39:38.936
You don't recognize me, do you?

39:42.559 --> 39:44.504
You attempted to cut off my head.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.077
I have something you want.

39:50.392 --> 39:53.396
Leave my family alone. It's me you want.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.935
Actually, no.

39:56.115 --> 39:58.242
<i>You have a nasty habit
of not staying dead.</i>

39:59.107 --> 40:01.223
<i>I'm guessing your offspring
are not so lucky.</i>

40:01.312 --> 40:03.155
Now as you surmise,

40:03.245 --> 40:05.483
I could kill everyone
in this sad diner easily

40:05.594 --> 40:07.011
unless I get what I want.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.653
<i>Which is?</i>

40:08.903 --> 40:11.276
The prism on your right hand.

40:11.445 --> 40:13.205
Calvin, you watch movies, right?

40:13.260 --> 40:15.993
You know the rules. Come alone.

40:16.151 --> 40:19.087
<i>If you alert the authorities or let
your overprotective father</i>

40:19.168 --> 40:21.588
interfere, they all die.

40:22.612 --> 40:25.430
Dropping you the pin now
with the location.

40:27.079 --> 40:28.500
<i>Well, hurry.</i>

40:28.579 --> 40:30.044
Because when these two stop chatting,

40:30.516 --> 40:32.453
<i>I make my move.</i>

40:38.886 --> 40:41.105
Dr. Kim.

40:42.487 --> 40:44.860
Here's your phone back. I'm sorry.

40:45.002 --> 40:47.685
I didn't mean to hold you hostage.

40:53.612 --> 40:55.822
Dad, we can't risk it.

40:56.479 --> 40:58.139
You can't go.

40:58.298 --> 41:01.108
- This isn't an obvious trap, son.
- Yeah, of course.

41:01.187 --> 41:03.655
But you can't go. You heard him.

41:03.789 --> 41:07.188
You'd do the same thing
if it was me held hostage.

41:08.729 --> 41:10.418
Hey.

41:10.779 --> 41:12.585
Hold on a second. Get off your bike.

41:12.656 --> 41:14.419
Turn your back to me.

41:16.458 --> 41:17.693
Look.

41:18.562 --> 41:20.361
It's gonna hurt a little bit.

41:20.545 --> 41:22.090
It's gonna help me track you.

41:25.348 --> 41:26.817
It better.

42:16.554 --> 42:17.681
Yeah.

42:17.859 --> 42:19.660
<i>In the back of the
van you'll find handcuffs.</i>

42:19.700 --> 42:21.549
<i>You know what to do.</i>

42:44.761 --> 42:46.153
We got him.
