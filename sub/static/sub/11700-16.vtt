WEBVTT

00:03.593 --> 00:05.195
Oh, hey, what's up guys?

00:05.195 --> 00:06.196
Hey, Ben.

00:06.196 --> 00:07.764
What's going on, Ben?

00:07.764 --> 00:09.099
How was your night, Ben?

00:09.099 --> 00:12.335
We were just wondering how that
emergency turned out, Ben.

00:12.335 --> 00:13.703
What emergency?

00:13.703 --> 00:15.372
Oh, you remember.

00:15.372 --> 00:19.442
The "can somebody pick up Emma,
it's an emergency" emergency.

00:19.442 --> 00:21.541
Turns out, it was less of an emergency,

00:21.641 --> 00:23.042
and more of an after-work pub crawl.

00:23.042 --> 00:25.611
Which is funny, because, you
know, we work in a bar.

00:27.013 --> 00:28.748
What is the matter with you?

00:28.748 --> 00:30.616
For the last six hours

00:30.616 --> 00:33.586
Emma has been passed around more
than a joint at a Bon Jovi concert.

00:34.654 --> 00:36.122
I hear.

00:36.122 --> 00:39.625
Or your mom on ladies' night.

00:40.526 --> 00:42.544
Yeah. I had to pick her up from
daycare, and I missed practice.

00:42.644 --> 00:44.612
Yeah, so I took her next
and I missed a deposition.

00:44.646 --> 00:46.710
Yeah, then she passed her on to me,
and I missed an interview.

00:46.810 --> 00:49.945
So, he passed her to me,
and I missed a date with a sure thing.

00:49.979 --> 00:52.748
Who I, coincidentally,
met at ladies' night.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.818
So, what do you have to say for yourself?

00:55.852 --> 00:58.454
Well, it sounds like a pretty
well-oiled machine to me.

00:58.488 --> 00:59.521
Thanks for helping out.

00:59.556 --> 01:00.589
- What?
- But...

01:00.623 --> 01:02.391
"thanks for helping out"?

01:02.425 --> 01:04.492
That's what you say when somebody
takes you to the airport,

01:04.527 --> 01:06.395
not raises your child for you.

01:06.429 --> 01:08.997
Uh, raising my child?

01:09.032 --> 01:10.999
I've been a single dad
for almost two years now.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.134
I've kind of got it down.

01:12.168 --> 01:14.803
Yeah.
By having everyone else do all the work.

01:14.838 --> 01:17.005
Well, I have a system, obviously.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.976
Okay. So, you actually think that
you could do all of this without us?

01:21.010 --> 01:22.044
Yeah, totally.

01:22.078 --> 01:23.946
- Oh, great. Frees up a lot of time.
- Oh, yeah, wow.

01:23.980 --> 01:27.683
Says the boy who forgot to feed
seven hamsters and they all died.

01:27.717 --> 01:28.750
Good luck!

01:33.556 --> 01:36.859
(Scoffs) I can take care of my own kid.

01:36.893 --> 01:38.527
Wait, where is she?

01:38.561 --> 01:40.929

01:52.575 --> 01:54.476
oh my God, so late, so late.

01:54.511 --> 01:55.611
We need a shirt. Shirt. Yes!

01:55.645 --> 01:57.746
Okay. Uh, socks. Socks.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.581
Uh, one sock is good, right?

01:59.616 --> 02:00.616
That's fashion-y.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.750
Oh, God.

02:01.784 --> 02:05.420
Hair, hair. A baby comb over. Totally in.

02:05.455 --> 02:06.688
Um, all right, lunch.

02:06.723 --> 02:08.657
Lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch.

02:08.691 --> 02:11.660
Uh, great. Nothing in here.

02:11.694 --> 02:15.631
Okay, well, now seems like a good time
to find out if you like kung pao chicken.

02:15.665 --> 02:18.734
All right, keys, wallet, phone binky, tie,

02:18.768 --> 02:20.636
and diaper bag.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.670
Yeah!

02:21.704 --> 02:24.840
See? I totally got this!

02:26.709 --> 02:29.444
He so don't got this.

02:29.479 --> 02:31.647
I liked yesterday's episode so much more

02:31.681 --> 02:32.881
when they both left without their shoes.

02:32.916 --> 02:34.516
(Laughing)

02:34.551 --> 02:35.784
(Phone buzzing)

02:37.520 --> 02:39.621
Oh. Damn it!

02:39.656 --> 02:41.890
Judy Baker backed out of
taking a cooking class with me,

02:41.925 --> 02:43.625
and it's nonrefundable.

02:43.660 --> 02:44.893
Oh, I can't believe it.

02:44.928 --> 02:46.795
You paid for something?

02:48.631 --> 02:51.466
Actually, I didn't. She did.

02:51.501 --> 02:54.570
So, who wants to take a free cooking class?

02:54.604 --> 02:57.639
It's with Tommy kwan,
New York's hottest chef.

02:57.674 --> 03:00.576
And, I'm not just talking
about his cooking skills.

03:00.610 --> 03:01.777
Oh, I watch him every week.

03:01.811 --> 03:03.478
I love that show!

03:03.513 --> 03:06.715
Danny and Bonnie: Let's turn up the heat,
it's time to eat!

03:06.749 --> 03:08.650
Well, the best cook in the class

03:08.685 --> 03:12.154
gets to work side-by-side with him
in his restaurant for one night.

03:12.188 --> 03:15.223
It is on my list of
things to do before I die.

03:15.258 --> 03:18.060
And, coincidentally, so is Tommy.

03:20.029 --> 03:21.830
Hey, I'll take that class with you.

03:21.864 --> 03:24.032
It'll be fun. It'll totally impress Ashley.

03:24.067 --> 03:26.668
Ooh, Ashley, the new girlfriend.

03:26.703 --> 03:28.704
Haven't really heard you
talk too much about her.

03:28.738 --> 03:31.473
In fact, I haven't really heard
you talk too much to me, lately,

03:31.507 --> 03:34.776
so, how's it going? Is she fun?
Do you like her? Any juicy details?

03:34.811 --> 03:37.546
Remember when you said you weren't
going to interfere with my love life?

03:37.580 --> 03:40.449
No. That doesn't sound like me, at all.

03:40.483 --> 03:41.617
I gotta go.

03:41.651 --> 03:44.152
Oh, okay.
Well, you know, we'll chat more, later.

03:44.187 --> 03:45.487
All right, great. Hey, don't be a stranger.

03:45.521 --> 03:47.189
You know I'm just right across the hall.

03:47.223 --> 03:48.357
So, I'll see you around the neighborhood.

03:48.391 --> 03:50.225
And by neighborhood, I mean 4c.

03:50.259 --> 03:52.160
(Door closes)

03:52.195 --> 03:53.862
I think he got it.

03:56.799 --> 03:58.066
(Groans)

04:00.903 --> 04:01.903
Tucker,

04:01.938 --> 04:03.805
(groans)

04:03.840 --> 04:06.708
It's the universal sign
for someone in distress.

04:06.743 --> 04:08.510
And not making eye contact

04:08.544 --> 04:12.214
is the universal sign for leave me alone,
I am blowing stuff up.

04:14.550 --> 04:17.319
Danny is completely avoiding me.

04:17.353 --> 04:20.922
Do you think that he's acting weird because
I told him that I had feelings for him?

04:20.957 --> 04:24.893
No, you know, it's probably that you knew
he liked you, and didn't say anything

04:24.927 --> 04:26.928
and then you started dating
a parade of other guys.

04:26.963 --> 04:29.898
But, you know, I'm just guessing, so...

04:31.167 --> 04:33.835
God, I just want things to go
back to the way they used to be.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.637
You know,
when we told each other everything.

04:35.672 --> 04:39.441
You know, maybe it'd be less awkward
if you were dating someone too?

04:39.475 --> 04:40.609
You know, take the pressure off.

04:40.643 --> 04:43.612
What am I supposed to do?
Lie about having a boyfriend?

04:43.646 --> 04:45.480
Okay.

04:45.515 --> 04:48.350
You know how I've been dating
Christine for the last month?

04:48.384 --> 04:49.685
Yeah.

04:49.719 --> 04:52.287
Well, Christine stopped returning
my phone calls two weeks ago.

04:52.321 --> 04:54.156
But I'm too tired of being the dumpee.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.957
So, I'm faking our
relationship for another month

04:55.992 --> 04:57.993
until I dump her.

04:58.027 --> 05:00.996
Oh, by the way, she is gonna be devastated.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.964
(Laughing)

05:02.999 --> 05:04.866
Faking a relationship?

05:06.002 --> 05:07.669
Oh my God, that's brilliant!

05:07.704 --> 05:10.872
Hey, look, it's easy. You just have to,
you know, plant a few seeds.

05:10.907 --> 05:11.601
Mm-hmm.

05:11.626 --> 05:14.376
Right? Start talking about the
cute guy at the coffee shop.

05:14.410 --> 05:16.645
And then, maybe in a week, you guys go out.

05:16.679 --> 05:20.182
You know, just take it slow
and nobody will be suspicious.

05:20.216 --> 05:21.550
Take it slow.

05:23.119 --> 05:24.319
Oh hey, forgot my wallet.

05:24.353 --> 05:27.422
Hey, Danny! I have a boyfriend!

05:33.896 --> 05:35.197
Excuse me?

05:35.231 --> 05:36.164
Excuse me?

05:36.199 --> 05:37.833
Sorry, just a little busy over here.

05:37.867 --> 05:38.834
What can I do for you?

05:38.868 --> 05:39.868
You can get me a Cosmopolitan,

05:39.902 --> 05:41.870
and take back your baby.

05:44.874 --> 05:46.742
- Oh, Cici? Cici?
- Nope.

05:46.776 --> 05:48.643
Oh my God, Tucker, hey!

05:48.678 --> 05:49.611
You gotta take Emma.

05:49.645 --> 05:51.313
We got kicked out of daycare.

05:51.347 --> 05:53.348
Apparently, if you're late to
pickup three times, you're out.

05:53.382 --> 05:55.250
You know, you think they'd
give you some kind of warning.

05:55.284 --> 05:57.252
Sounds like they gave you two.

05:57.286 --> 06:00.388
Come on, man!
I actually have a date tonight.

06:00.423 --> 06:03.125
It's the first girl I've gone out
with since Riley and I broke up.

06:03.159 --> 06:05.894
I just hope Riley will be cool with it.

06:05.928 --> 06:09.765
Well, you know, I did just hear
that she kinda has a boyfriend.

06:09.799 --> 06:12.667
So, I'm gonna go with, um,
yeah, she'll be cool with that.

06:12.702 --> 06:13.935
Oh, she does?

06:13.970 --> 06:16.571
So, she's obviously moved on,

06:16.606 --> 06:17.806
which is great,

06:17.840 --> 06:18.774
'cause I'm moving on too.

06:18.808 --> 06:20.408
I mean, you think I should, right?

06:20.443 --> 06:21.643
Yup. I would.

06:21.677 --> 06:23.545
Okay, cool. So, you'll watch Emma for me?

06:23.579 --> 06:25.347
Oh, hell, no!

06:25.381 --> 06:27.449
No, you are on your own, single dad.

06:27.483 --> 06:30.018
Christine and I are going out tonight.

06:30.052 --> 06:32.387
Hot date with my hot lady.

06:36.159 --> 06:38.093
Danny, Danny, good news.

06:38.127 --> 06:40.095
I managed to taste everyone's food,

06:40.129 --> 06:41.897
and it all tastes like ass.

06:43.099 --> 06:45.000
That's great,
but I actually really like mine.

06:45.034 --> 06:47.569
Danny! You can't eat that!

06:47.603 --> 06:51.673
Tommy has to taste it, review it,
tell you how you can improve it.

06:51.707 --> 06:53.642
Or, how it's absolute perfection,

06:53.676 --> 06:55.443
and how he wishes you were on the menu.

06:55.478 --> 06:56.411
(Laughs)

06:56.445 --> 06:57.612
Oh, here he comes, here he comes!

06:57.647 --> 06:59.314
Okay, ladies.

06:59.348 --> 07:02.417
Hopefully you've followed my
assistants instructions on this recipe.

07:02.451 --> 07:05.187
Because I'm too young
and successful to die.

07:05.221 --> 07:07.022
(Laughing obnoxiously)

07:10.126 --> 07:11.927
(Coughs)

07:11.961 --> 07:16.665
I wouldn't serve that to my ex wife,
and I actually want to poison her.

07:16.699 --> 07:18.567
(Laughing) Classic Tommy.

07:18.601 --> 07:20.435
Okay.

07:20.469 --> 07:23.371
Now it's your turn to disappoint my palate.

07:23.406 --> 07:24.840
Hi. I'm Bonnie,

07:24.874 --> 07:28.577
and I have made your
"chicken Tommy" a thousand times.

07:28.611 --> 07:30.512
Then a thousand chickens died for nothing.

07:33.149 --> 07:34.182
What happened here?

07:34.217 --> 07:35.550
Oh, um...

07:35.585 --> 07:38.153
I'm just kind of tall,
so it makes the chicken look really small.

07:40.323 --> 07:41.890
Man.

07:41.924 --> 07:43.191
That's good.

07:43.226 --> 07:45.927
And I say, "man"
because I've never said that to a woman.

07:45.962 --> 07:46.895
(Laughing)

07:48.731 --> 07:50.866
Really? I just followed your instructions.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.535
My coach always says I do better
when I don't think for myself.

07:53.569 --> 07:55.403
Excellent advice.

07:55.438 --> 07:57.439
One you little ladies should follow.

07:57.473 --> 07:59.341
Who's next?

07:59.375 --> 08:01.576
(Gasps) Whoa.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.245
Who knew I had a hidden talent?

08:03.279 --> 08:06.047
Honey, the only thing you have that
I don't is what's in your pants.

08:07.149 --> 08:09.050
I didn't know you saw me take this.

08:12.989 --> 08:14.089
Tucker!

08:14.123 --> 08:15.190
Tucker, Tucker, Tucker,

08:16.726 --> 08:20.862
are you ready for our awesome double date

08:20.897 --> 08:23.565
with Christine and my
new boyfriend, Justin?

08:23.599 --> 08:26.468
- Danny's in his room.
- Oh.

08:26.502 --> 08:28.503
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, Danny!

08:28.537 --> 08:30.772
I'm just here for my awesome double date

08:30.806 --> 08:32.539
with Tucker and Christine

08:32.575 --> 08:34.476
and my new boyfriend, Justin.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.344
We are going to that new club on canal.

08:36.379 --> 08:38.380
Oh, right. Your boyfriend.

08:38.414 --> 08:41.049
Well, hey, maybe Ashley and
I can meet up with you later?

08:42.118 --> 08:44.219
Uh... yeah...

08:44.253 --> 08:46.988
You have to be on a list.

08:47.023 --> 08:52.827
Yeah. Yeah, my boyfriend, Justin,
had to pull a lot of strings.

08:52.862 --> 08:54.796
He's super connected.

08:56.465 --> 08:58.400
Not connected enough to get you in, sorry.

08:58.434 --> 08:59.367
Yup.

08:59.402 --> 09:01.269
Well, hey, do you want to share a cab?

09:01.304 --> 09:02.637
No. God, stop following us.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.407
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

09:05.441 --> 09:07.509
Oh, hi. You must be Marissa.

09:07.543 --> 09:09.144
Sorry.

09:09.178 --> 09:10.111
For what?

09:10.146 --> 09:12.147
I'm sure it'll be something.

09:14.417 --> 09:15.884
Hello?

09:15.918 --> 09:17.185
Marissa, hey. Hey.

09:17.219 --> 09:19.087
Thank you for coming over.

09:19.121 --> 09:20.889
Emma is asleep for the night,

09:20.923 --> 09:22.691
the takeout is on its way,

09:22.725 --> 09:25.727
and her crib has wheels,
so we can roll it out of the bedroom

09:25.761 --> 09:27.963
if you wanna swingity-swangity, bang, boom.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.702
Probably getting a little ahead of myself.

09:33.736 --> 09:35.337
A little.

09:35.371 --> 09:37.372
- But, I like where you're going.
- Ooh.

09:37.406 --> 09:41.176
<i>(Emma crying)</i>

09:41.210 --> 09:42.277
Are you gonna get that?

09:42.311 --> 09:44.045
Yeah, I probably should. Hold on a second.

09:47.283 --> 09:48.984
Hi, sweetheart.

09:49.018 --> 09:50.118
Hey, come here.

09:50.152 --> 09:51.219
Come here.

09:51.253 --> 09:53.188
Emma, you gotta go to sleep.

09:53.222 --> 09:55.957
I've got a very hot,
very special friend out there who can...

09:55.992 --> 09:57.859
Hear everything

09:57.893 --> 09:58.994
<i>on the monitor can't she?</i>

09:59.028 --> 10:02.497
Yup. But thanks for calling me hot.

10:02.531 --> 10:03.865
(Whispering) Works every time.

10:03.899 --> 10:05.567
- (Emma coos)
- Yeah.

10:13.242 --> 10:14.275
Ben?

10:17.279 --> 10:18.913
(Snoring)

10:20.316 --> 10:21.983
Hi.

10:26.932 --> 10:29.859
Well, if Tommy wants to be
intimidated by a woman,

10:29.959 --> 10:32.060
I think I just gave him a reason.

10:32.094 --> 10:33.695
Hey, mom. Try mine.

10:36.699 --> 10:38.533
Oh my God, Danny.

10:38.567 --> 10:39.767
That tastes like dishwater.

10:39.802 --> 10:41.769
Where did you get your water?

10:44.473 --> 10:45.573
(Gags)

10:47.476 --> 10:49.310
But you just gave me a great idea.

10:49.345 --> 10:50.511
Hey, could you grab me that ladle?

10:57.353 --> 10:59.254
And she's back.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.157
I'll try to go easy on you
since you're just a housewife.

11:03.192 --> 11:05.760
A housewife?

11:05.794 --> 11:10.665
You mean a woman who devotes her life
to her family, her kids, her home,

11:10.699 --> 11:15.403
and putting a meal on the table
three times a day, 365 days a year?

11:15.437 --> 11:17.705
Ah. It's even sadder
when you say it out loud.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.642
Oh. (Scoffs)

11:20.676 --> 11:25.179
Well, I hope I didn't cook
with too much estrogen.

11:25.214 --> 11:28.383
Oh, crap, I didn't put any of that in mine.

11:30.319 --> 11:33.154
Well, I have to say,

11:33.188 --> 11:35.223
this might just be the
best soup I've ever tasted.

11:35.257 --> 11:38.826
Congratulations Danny,
you'll be my guest sous-chef this evening

11:38.861 --> 11:40.962
ah!

11:42.798 --> 11:46.534
I switched the bowls. That is my soup.

11:46.568 --> 11:48.770
- Prove it.
- I can't!

11:50.606 --> 11:52.473
I did not think that one through.

11:52.508 --> 11:54.409
So, you are just going
to have to believe me.

11:54.443 --> 11:55.410
Well, I don't.

11:55.444 --> 11:57.445
Well, you know what? It doesn't matter.

11:57.479 --> 12:00.481
Because my son actually respects women,

12:00.516 --> 12:04.886
and he wouldn't accept your blatantly
sexist honor if you paid him.

12:04.920 --> 12:05.887
Tell him, Danny.

12:07.122 --> 12:08.756
So, what time do you need me here, tonight?

12:13.062 --> 12:14.062
So, anyway,

12:14.096 --> 12:15.897
I think my date went
pretty good last night.

12:15.931 --> 12:20.635
We just went straight to the swingity-swang,
bingity bang, boom, swigity-swang.

12:23.439 --> 12:25.206
I fell asleep in bed with Emma.

12:27.209 --> 12:29.544
- Oh, hey.
- God, you know who's a good kisser?

12:29.578 --> 12:31.446
Justin.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.214
Oh. Oh, Danny, hi.

12:33.248 --> 12:34.282
I didn't see you walk in.

12:34.316 --> 12:35.350
How's your class going?

12:35.384 --> 12:37.085
Actually, it's great!

12:37.119 --> 12:38.920
Tommy asked me to cook at
his restaurant tonight.

12:38.954 --> 12:40.922
Wait, you're working there?

12:40.956 --> 12:42.890
Dude, oh my God,
can you get me a reservation?

12:42.925 --> 12:44.692
His restaurant is the
hottest place in town.

12:44.727 --> 12:45.960
Marissa can't turn down
a do-over date there.

12:45.994 --> 12:47.762
- I can try.
- All right, all right, all right.

12:50.566 --> 12:52.533
Well, hey, what if all you guys came?

12:52.568 --> 12:54.569
You and Christine, and you and Justin.
I'd love to meet him.

12:54.603 --> 12:57.305
Uh...

12:57.339 --> 13:00.441
(Scoffs) Christine? She's a model.
You know,

13:00.476 --> 13:02.243
she's not really into food.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.948
We'd love to.

13:06.982 --> 13:09.217
Justin, he's scheduled for surgery,
but, pfft,

13:09.251 --> 13:10.852
I'll just have him move it.

13:10.886 --> 13:13.755
Yeah, my boyfriend's a doctor.

13:13.789 --> 13:15.857
Cool. I'll let you know.

13:18.093 --> 13:19.694
Hey, um, Riley?

13:19.728 --> 13:23.798
Do you think, maybe, you can ask your
doctor boyfriend to examine your head?

13:23.832 --> 13:27.502
You know,
unless crazy doesn't show up on x-rays.

13:27.536 --> 13:30.371
Tucker, this is totally working.

13:30.406 --> 13:32.640
I mean, Danny is finally talking
to me again the way he used to.

13:32.674 --> 13:35.376
Yeah. You're forgetting one teensy detail.

13:35.411 --> 13:37.545
Justin doesn't exist!

13:37.579 --> 13:40.348
You're so negative.

13:40.382 --> 13:42.216
Why can't you be more like Justin?

13:45.888 --> 13:48.856
Okay, Emma, this new babysitter
is charging me $20 an hour

13:48.891 --> 13:50.792
so, feel free to be as bratty as you want.

13:50.826 --> 13:51.826
(Knocking)

13:51.860 --> 13:53.027
We need to get our money's worth.

13:55.998 --> 13:58.533
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Madison.

13:58.567 --> 13:59.767
We spoke on the phone.

13:59.802 --> 14:00.768
So, where's the kid?

14:00.803 --> 14:02.837
Standing on my doormat.

14:02.871 --> 14:04.739
You said you had 10 years experience?

14:04.773 --> 14:07.575
Yeah, I'm 10. Well, I will be next week.

14:10.245 --> 14:11.179
Buh-bye.

14:13.282 --> 14:15.249
Great. Now what am I supposed to do?

14:17.386 --> 14:19.187
Emma, grab your binkie!

14:19.221 --> 14:21.189
You're going on your first date.

14:28.526 --> 14:31.595
Hey, um, do I still get charged fro
two coats if I put hers in my pocket?

14:31.629 --> 14:34.264
Aww, what a little cutie!

14:34.298 --> 14:35.432
She's adorable.

14:35.466 --> 14:38.268
Oh my God, she makes me
miss my baby sister.

14:38.302 --> 14:39.302
I practically raised her.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.238
Really?

14:41.272 --> 14:43.840
Hey, how much is it to check a baby?

14:47.111 --> 14:49.746
Hey, Marissa, I'm so
glad you could make it.

14:49.781 --> 14:50.847
Isn't this great?

14:50.882 --> 14:51.982
Fancy dinner out?

14:52.016 --> 14:53.884
Oh, seven courses?

14:53.918 --> 14:56.520
My babysitter's charging me by the minute.
Let's get cracking.

14:58.656 --> 14:59.589
Where are your dates?

15:00.758 --> 15:02.559
Oh, uh, I just talked to Justin,

15:02.593 --> 15:04.494
and he got pulled into surgery.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.564
And Christine booked a last minute gig,
so she's gonna be running late too.

15:07.598 --> 15:10.167
But, they both just sent
us lovely text messages.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.169
So, no reason to be suspicious.

15:14.172 --> 15:17.207
Yeah. Yeah, what she said, but less crazy.

15:19.277 --> 15:20.877
Kind of a slow eater, aren't you?

15:25.783 --> 15:27.851
There he is. Ready to
see how real men cook?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.820
- You know it.
- Great. Tell me what you think of this.

15:31.823 --> 15:32.756
Salty.

15:32.790 --> 15:33.757
And a little weird.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.593
Out of the way, boys.

15:36.627 --> 15:38.628
Tonight, mama's making dinner.

15:38.663 --> 15:41.465
Let's see what you think
of this housewife's food.

15:41.499 --> 15:43.400
Mom! What are you doing here?

15:43.434 --> 15:44.634
I demand a re-taste.

15:44.669 --> 15:47.370
I am not leaving until
you try my chicken Tommy,

15:47.405 --> 15:49.339
and declare me the rightful winner.

15:49.373 --> 15:51.007
You mean instead of your son?

15:51.042 --> 15:52.242
Who you supposedly love and support?

15:52.276 --> 15:53.410
Who told you that?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.047
Try it.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.248
Of course.

15:58.282 --> 16:00.984
Let me stop cooking for a
restaurant full of people

16:01.018 --> 16:03.019
so I can pull up a chair, eat your chicken.

16:03.054 --> 16:04.988
And apologize for being so rude.

16:05.022 --> 16:07.591
I accept your apology.

16:07.625 --> 16:08.892
Wanna make out?

16:10.828 --> 16:11.795
No.

16:11.829 --> 16:14.431
Here's what I think of your food.

16:14.465 --> 16:15.599
(Plate shattering)

16:15.633 --> 16:16.666
Now look what you've done!

16:16.701 --> 16:18.335
Somebody get a mop!

16:18.369 --> 16:19.369
(Gasps)

16:19.403 --> 16:22.172
Francois, help Bobby!

16:22.206 --> 16:23.406
Whoa!

16:23.441 --> 16:25.075
It's just a little...

16:25.109 --> 16:26.076
whoa!

16:26.110 --> 16:28.945
(Dishes clattering)

16:28.980 --> 16:30.914
(Shouts)

16:36.787 --> 16:38.555
You know what?

16:38.589 --> 16:39.923
You can try it later.

16:43.661 --> 16:46.796
Hey, we're ready for the next course, guy.
Let's keep it coming, eh?

16:46.831 --> 16:49.332
Riley, where's your boyfriend?

16:49.367 --> 16:51.334
Uh, he's um, he's...

16:51.369 --> 16:52.702
What did I say he was doing, Tucker?

16:52.737 --> 16:56.139
Oh my God, you are terrible at this!

16:56.174 --> 16:59.309
Look, I'm done, we're done,
Justin's not real.

16:59.343 --> 17:01.044
What do you mean "not real"?

17:01.078 --> 17:02.112
He's not real punctual.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.413
Oh my God, look, here he is now.

17:03.447 --> 17:06.183
Hi, honey!

17:06.217 --> 17:07.917
Oh, you made it!

17:07.952 --> 17:09.252
Uh, Justin, this is Danny.

17:09.287 --> 17:12.021
Danny, this is my Justin.

17:12.056 --> 17:14.824
Thank God you're here.
We need a doctor in the kitchen!

17:14.858 --> 17:15.892
What the hell?

17:15.926 --> 17:16.960
We just made out in the coat room,

17:16.993 --> 17:18.962
and now you're kissing some random skank?

17:21.598 --> 17:23.567
Justin, how could you?

17:23.601 --> 17:25.468
I bet you're not even a real doctor!

17:27.738 --> 17:30.607
You should be real glad I
have an emergency right now.

17:30.641 --> 17:33.343
Wait, hey, hey, what'd you do with my kid?

17:33.377 --> 17:34.377
You brought your kid?

17:34.412 --> 17:36.146
Emma!

17:36.180 --> 17:37.981
Oh, yeah,
she really wanted to come, tonight.

17:38.015 --> 17:38.982
She's kind of a foodie.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.283
Tucker, help me catch her!

17:42.887 --> 17:44.154
Tucker?

17:44.188 --> 17:45.822
Christine?

17:45.856 --> 17:49.726
Oh. I guess I know what you've been up to.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.894
- Tucker...
- No, just so you know,

17:50.928 --> 17:53.597
I have been pretending to
date you for two weeks,

17:53.631 --> 17:55.732
and that was more fun than
the two weeks we did date.

17:55.766 --> 17:58.835
Yeah. That's right.
I am better off with fake you.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.704
So, enjoy your stupid date.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.539
This is my brother.

18:02.573 --> 18:05.342
My phone was stolen and I lost your number,

18:05.376 --> 18:07.244
so I wasn't able to tell
you that I had to go

18:07.278 --> 18:09.379
to my grandmother's funeral in California.

18:09.413 --> 18:11.348
I just got back, today.

18:11.382 --> 18:14.184
And you expect me to believe all of that?

18:14.218 --> 18:16.086
Because I do, girl, I'm really sorry.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.988
(Scoffs) Yeah, so am I.

18:18.022 --> 18:19.289
Don't call me.

18:19.323 --> 18:20.290
Emma?

18:20.324 --> 18:22.025
Oh, hey, Christine, you made it!

18:23.194 --> 18:24.194
Emma!

18:25.863 --> 18:26.896
This is a disaster!

18:26.931 --> 18:28.064
Danny, start plating my chicken.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.501
Ah! Hot!

18:31.535 --> 18:32.702
What's wrong with you?

18:32.737 --> 18:35.572
That's it! Tell everybody to go home.
We're done.

18:35.606 --> 18:38.441
Oh, calm down, Tom-Tom.

18:38.476 --> 18:41.378
Can't take a little spill
and some food on the ground?

18:41.412 --> 18:42.812
Try getting dinner on the table every night

18:42.847 --> 18:45.582
with two kids and 12 of their friends
playing dodgeball in the kitchen.

18:45.616 --> 18:46.616
I got this.

18:46.651 --> 18:49.519
Danny, get mama's chicken.

18:49.553 --> 18:51.121
Yes, ma'am.

18:51.155 --> 18:52.322
Wait, you can't serve that!

18:52.356 --> 18:55.091
You'd rather lose a
restaurant full of customers

18:55.126 --> 18:56.526
than serve a woman's food?

18:56.560 --> 19:00.964
At least a housewife doesn't crack
under pressure like a little boy.

19:00.998 --> 19:04.200
Danny, throw some asparagus on a
plate and put my chicken on top of it.

19:04.235 --> 19:06.936
Bobby, pour some of my sauce on everything.

19:06.971 --> 19:10.573
And francois, just throw some green
crap around the plate to fancy it up.

19:10.608 --> 19:11.775
Oh, and Tommy,

19:11.809 --> 19:14.544
just keep whining like a baby.

19:14.578 --> 19:17.647
Let's turn up the heat, it's time to eat!

19:17.682 --> 19:20.650
Gary, don't just stand there!
I'm gonna need more wine!

19:20.685 --> 19:22.419
Let's do this, people!

19:27.191 --> 19:28.558
Ben: My bad, my bad. Look out.

19:30.594 --> 19:32.228
Oh, hey, a dollar!

19:35.366 --> 19:36.399
What happened to Marissa?

19:36.434 --> 19:39.169
Turns out,
she wasn't a giant fan of the baby.

19:39.203 --> 19:40.437
And Justin?

19:40.471 --> 19:43.373
Yeah, turns out he's a giant liar.

19:43.407 --> 19:45.308
And Christine?

19:45.343 --> 19:48.244
Turns out, I'm a giant idiot.

19:48.279 --> 19:50.447
Well, then I guess it's just us.

19:50.481 --> 19:54.117
Here's to another
unsuccessful romantic evening.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.086
We'll all get this down eventually, right?

19:56.120 --> 19:57.354
Probably not.

19:57.388 --> 19:59.022
That's what this wine is for.

20:01.359 --> 20:05.428
(Applause)

20:05.463 --> 20:07.430
Well, mom...

20:07.465 --> 20:09.265
I think they love your chicken Tommy.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.369
You mean, chicken Bonnie.

20:12.403 --> 20:14.137
(Whispering) It's not chicken.

20:18.639 --> 20:20.857
Okay, so thank you all for gathering.

20:20.957 --> 20:22.991
This'll be easier to say just once.

20:23.025 --> 20:24.259
Look.

20:24.293 --> 20:26.895
I was wrong, you were all right.

20:26.929 --> 20:28.230
I couldn't do this without you.

20:28.264 --> 20:32.234
It really does take a village,
and I took my village for granted.

20:32.268 --> 20:35.203
So, can you all forgive me?

20:35.238 --> 20:38.206
And help me?

20:38.241 --> 20:40.909
- Oh, sweetie, of course.
- Hey, Emma.

20:40.943 --> 20:42.777
- Emma, I missed you so much.
- Come here, girl.

20:42.812 --> 20:46.148
No, no. Oh, she wants to come
to the mayor of the village.

20:46.182 --> 20:48.016
(All arguing)
