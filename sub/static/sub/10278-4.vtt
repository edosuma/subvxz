E. R.

00:06.459 --> 00:08.041
Previously on E. R.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.457
So what is my position here?

00:09.458 --> 00:11.553
You have no position here, Peter.

00:11.854 --> 00:14.537
- You're firing me?
- No, no, no, no.

00:15.018 --> 00:16.454
You fired yourself.

00:16.455 --> 00:18.740
- We're short on nurses.
- I'm an OB nurse.

00:18.741 --> 00:21.296
- Are you planning on going back to med school?
- Yes.

00:21.331 --> 00:23.473
Ok, then you might as well work
as a nurse in the ER.

00:23.474 --> 00:25.615
You'll see more medicine down here
than upstairs.

00:25.616 --> 00:26.770
Listen, if you need anything...

00:26.771 --> 00:29.530
...talk about a case
or a patient or anything...

00:29.531 --> 00:31.418
- ...just come find me.
- I will.

00:31.419 --> 00:33.893
You could be a great doctor.

00:37.654 --> 00:39.753
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

00:39.754 --> 00:41.986
You're an excellent surgeon, Peter.

00:42.833 --> 00:46.385
And you're a good man,
and we'll work it out.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.488
E. R. 7x04 "BENTON BACKWARDS"

00:50.660 --> 00:52.617
I could come in for another interview.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.158
As a matter of fact,
I could come in this morning.

00:55.330 --> 00:57.785
Yes, I know.
But you said you were interested.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.625
Actually, you said
you were very interested.

01:00.792 --> 01:03.080
Right. But if you could just-

01:04.920 --> 01:08.288
Right, right, right. Thank you.

01:09.506 --> 01:12.376
- Want some breakfast?
- No.

01:12.842 --> 01:15.712
- Going over applications?
- Yep.

01:15.886 --> 01:17.927
I thought you took
the position at Loyola.

01:18.004 --> 01:19.318
- Withdrawn.
- Why?

01:19.397 --> 01:22.881
I don't know, Cleo. Maybe because I
took another job somewhere else.

01:23.057 --> 01:25.215
- Have you tried Northwestern?
- Fully staffed.

01:25.392 --> 01:27.135
- U. of C.?
- What do you think?

01:27.310 --> 01:30.476
Right now, I think you're being an ass.

01:30.646 --> 01:33.136
You barely say anything.
And when you do, it's rude.

01:33.315 --> 01:36.184
- I talk to you, Cleo.
- Not about this.

01:36.358 --> 01:40.686
- Why don't you let me help, Peter?
- I don't need your help. I need a job.

01:40.862 --> 01:43.815
I should have left County
when I had a chance.

01:48.575 --> 01:52.654
- Out for fresh air?
- Man found down. ETA is any minute.

01:52.828 --> 01:56.825
- They're letting you work on traumas.
- If I only handle two patients at a time.

01:56.998 --> 01:58.705
- Really?
- Weaver's rules.

01:58.874 --> 02:01.495
- Play by them or die by them.
- Thanks.

02:01.668 --> 02:05.996
She didn't exactly ask me
if I wanted to be assigned to the ER.

02:06.921 --> 02:09.708
What are you supposed to do
while you wait for labs?

02:09.882 --> 02:13.166
- Catch up on medical journals.
- That sucks.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.175
Showtime.

02:17.470 --> 02:21.170
- You with me on this one?
- Male, 50, found in the park. Full arrest.

02:21.348 --> 02:23.506
- That's one well-fed bum.
- How'd you load him?

02:23.683 --> 02:29.435
- Paid a bunch of his buddies 5 bucks.
- Come on. Let's go. One, two, three.

02:30.479 --> 02:34.345
Large lac to the occipital scalp. Not sure
if he was rolled or fell out of his tree.

02:34.524 --> 02:36.480
- What's he doing in a tree?
- Maybe he lived in it.

02:36.650 --> 02:37.978
Why didn't you intubate him?

02:38.151 --> 02:40.642
His neck's like a power pole.
We couldn't find the cords.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.025
It was 40 degrees last night.
He's hypothermic.

02:43.196 --> 02:46.031
- We might still get him back.
- With what, a blowtorch?

02:46.199 --> 02:49.364
Active core rewarming.
Set up for pleural and peritoneal lavage.

02:49.534 --> 02:51.692
All right, I'm in. Bag him.
Who's got scissors?

02:51.869 --> 02:55.403
Good air bilaterally. So, Carter,
you know anyone who plays hockey?

02:55.580 --> 02:56.955
- No.
- Get me some warm blankets.

02:57.123 --> 02:59.530
- I need an extra guy for a game tonight.
- I'm busy.

02:59.708 --> 03:03.835
- I was asking if you knew anyone.
- Okay. Looks like we're in fine V-fib.

03:04.003 --> 03:06.457
- Core temp is 86.
- So is his pulse ox.

03:06.629 --> 03:09.202
- Charge the paddles to 360.
- Why? He's a frozen dinner.

03:09.381 --> 03:13.674
Put two chest tubes in on the right. Run
warm saline through the rapid infuser.

03:13.843 --> 03:16.463
- You're kidding.
- He's not dead until he's warm and dead.

03:16.636 --> 03:21.096
- I'll prep the chest. 32 French okay?
- Yeah. Okay, everybody clear.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.888
- What the hell?
- Where did all the pigeons come from?

03:25.059 --> 03:28.012
Give me an amp of epi.
All right. Charge again. Clear.

03:28.186 --> 03:30.557
- They must have been in his coat.
- They're attacking.

03:30.729 --> 03:31.760
Still in V-fib.

03:31.939 --> 03:35.104
Damn it! Get over here and do CPR!
Charging to 360.

03:35.274 --> 03:36.934
Do CPR? The guy's brain-dead.

03:37.109 --> 03:38.816
Not until I say so. Clear.

04:28.910 --> 04:31.003
E. R.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.439
A bunch of beauty contestants were
in the salon getting final touches.

04:36.608 --> 04:38.766
A worker mixed the wrong
chemicals, and boom!

04:38.943 --> 04:43.355
- Who's the worst?
- That'd be Audrey Hoffman, Miss Skokie.

04:43.530 --> 04:47.396
Lacerations and partial-thickness
burns on her legs, and smoke inhalation.

04:47.574 --> 04:50.907
- Hi, Audrey. I'm Dr. Greene.
- My legs. Are they bad?

04:51.077 --> 04:54.361
I'm gonna check your breathing first.
Can you lean forward?

04:54.704 --> 04:56.945
- Any shortness of breath?
- No.

04:57.123 --> 05:00.906
- Uh-huh. Any chest pain?
- Not really.

05:01.084 --> 05:03.408
Miss Tri-State is tonight.

05:03.961 --> 05:05.075
Is it bad?

05:06.671 --> 05:09.244
Well, nothing that won't heal.

05:09.423 --> 05:13.799
- Does this mean that I'm out?
- We're gonna do everything we can.

05:15.344 --> 05:18.095
- What's your talent?
- Rhythmic dancing.

05:18.846 --> 05:20.885
With hoops and ribbons.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.927
Malik, how many times you gonna
pass by with the same cart?

05:26.101 --> 05:28.935
- I got a spot on my hockey team.
- Do I look like I play hockey?

05:29.103 --> 05:31.428
What about your pal in Cards?
Big East-Indian dude.

05:31.605 --> 05:34.273
I can skate. I played in college,
if you're in a pinch.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.555
Yeah, yeah. Sure thing.

05:35.733 --> 05:39.314
Dr. Chen. Cute guy, Curtain 3,
daddy material. Just say thanks, okay?

05:39.485 --> 05:41.145
- Malucci, wait-
- Chen!

05:41.320 --> 05:43.893
- What?
- Your mother's been holding 10 minutes.

05:44.072 --> 05:45.779
Not very pleasantly, I might add.

05:45.948 --> 05:47.987
Just tell her I'm with a patient.
Thank you.

05:48.158 --> 05:52.653
Lying might be part of your
job description. It's not part of mine.

05:53.579 --> 05:54.907
Yeah. Hello, Mommy.

05:56.497 --> 05:57.777
Well, I've been busy.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.119
Morning, Dr. Weaver.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.781
- Frank, any messages?
- Yeah. Quite a few.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.619
- Thank you.
- Power meeting today?

06:03.794 --> 06:06.035
I have a seminar
that I do not have time for.

06:06.212 --> 06:08.703
Could you remind me
to leave by 6, please?

06:08.881 --> 06:12.000
- Seemed like a good idea at the time.
- Super glue.

06:12.175 --> 06:14.630
- I hope that's one of two.
- The bird man still dead?

06:14.802 --> 06:17.126
It's one of one.
Are there any traumas coming in?

06:17.303 --> 06:21.715
No. But I've got a guy in Exam 3
who cut his hand on a tin can.

06:22.307 --> 06:24.714
Dr. Gottschalk, you have a minute?

06:24.892 --> 06:28.474
Unfortunately, I'm on my way
to a conference and I'm very late.

06:28.645 --> 06:32.344
I'll make this quick. I'd like to discuss
with you the faculty position here.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.095
- I really have to go.
- I just need a minute.

06:35.274 --> 06:37.432
I apologize for bothering
you like this, but-

06:37.609 --> 06:40.479
After you turned us down,
we offered it to someone else.

06:40.653 --> 06:43.108
- Has it been accepted?
- Well, not officially.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.648
- Then you can withdraw it.
- Our candidate has excellent credentials.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.859
- So do I.
- And he has positive recommendations.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.065
And I don't?

06:51.244 --> 06:54.113
I'm not at liberty to discuss
your current standing.

06:54.287 --> 06:57.157
- Which means Romano said something?
- I can't get into this.

06:57.331 --> 06:58.955
- What did he tell you?
- Dr. Benton-

06:59.124 --> 07:02.706
No. I need to know what that man said
and who he said it to.

07:02.877 --> 07:08.214
You may have difficulty finding work
locally. That's all I can say. I'm sorry.

07:10.549 --> 07:12.671
- It's 1100 hours.
- Excuse me?

07:12.842 --> 07:14.122
I need to ship out.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.001
Okay. Sir, if you're waiting
for a transfer to another facility...

07:18.179 --> 07:19.922
...why don't we have a nurse help you.

07:20.097 --> 07:21.840
- We're taking Inchon!
- Inchon?

07:22.015 --> 07:24.719
Korea. Huge battle, if memory serves.

07:24.892 --> 07:28.260
- Sorry. He's a wanderer.
- What's his story?

07:28.436 --> 07:31.934
72 years old, from the Golden Glen
Nursing Home. Altered mental status.

07:32.105 --> 07:34.477
He became combative
and got punched in the nose.

07:34.649 --> 07:35.763
History of dementia?

07:35.941 --> 07:38.147
No. The military talk
started a few days ago.

07:38.318 --> 07:40.559
- Anything on exam?
- His nose isn't broken.

07:40.736 --> 07:43.606
But he has a low-grade temp
with no obvious signs of infection.

07:43.780 --> 07:48.073
CBC, Chem-7 and UA.
If his pulse ox is low, get a chest film.

07:48.408 --> 07:49.985
Damn tab busted off.

07:51.077 --> 07:53.069
You ever think about
using a can opener?

07:53.245 --> 07:55.700
Sure. But then what's the point
of having a tab?

07:57.206 --> 07:59.743
I started digging
around the edges there.

07:59.916 --> 08:02.406
It looks to me like you may need
a few stitches.

08:02.585 --> 08:05.917
Of course, the tuna juice leaks out.
And it gets greasy all over.

08:06.087 --> 08:08.494
And then, bam!
The knife goes right into my hand.

08:10.465 --> 08:13.916
I'm going to do a regional block
to numb the area...

08:14.093 --> 08:16.001
...around where I'm gonna be suturing.

08:16.177 --> 08:18.549
Are you sure you've done this before?

08:18.721 --> 08:21.258
Sorry. I need some I and D kits.

08:23.099 --> 08:25.221
You might feel a little burning.

08:27.018 --> 08:29.556
I'm going to the 8:00 tonight, Abby.
How about you?

08:29.895 --> 08:31.603
I don't know. Maybe.

08:35.774 --> 08:37.932
The exact same thing happened
when I tried...

08:38.109 --> 08:40.515
...to open a milk carton
with a pair of scissors.

08:40.695 --> 08:44.773
The bruises sort of sprang up overnight.
That's why I brought him in here.

08:44.947 --> 08:47.354
He has Niemann-Pick's Type A.

08:47.533 --> 08:50.947
I have some material here,
if you're not familiar.

08:51.118 --> 08:53.869
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.111
His liver and spleen are both enlarged.

08:57.289 --> 09:00.242
That's from the sphingomyelin deposits
in both organs.

09:00.417 --> 09:03.831
Well, a big spleen chews up platelets.
That's why he's bleeding.

09:04.002 --> 09:07.619
- Is there anything we can do?
- We can make him more comfortable.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.579
- I'll start him on some morphine.
- Would that make him unconscious?

09:11.758 --> 09:15.042
Because I want him to be lucid
for as long as he can be.

09:16.136 --> 09:18.424
It'll be a very small dose of medicine.

09:18.596 --> 09:22.260
What about the spleen?
You said that's causing the problem.

09:22.432 --> 09:25.966
Well, if it's taken out,
that might help stop the bleeding...

09:26.435 --> 09:29.055
...but you do know
your son is end-stage?

09:29.228 --> 09:31.137
Yes.

09:33.398 --> 09:38.272
We'll get an ultrasound of his abdomen,
and I'll have a surgeon come take a look.

09:38.443 --> 09:41.858
- Thank you.
- Okay. You're welcome.

09:46.740 --> 09:51.448
Dr. Chen? I usually wait for labs
to come back before consulting Surgery.

09:51.619 --> 09:55.662
He's got splenomegaly. Pretty clear case
of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.

09:55.830 --> 09:59.577
- I thought you said he was end-stage.
- It doesn't mean he can't have surgery.

09:59.749 --> 10:03.248
I'd think about whether it's
appropriate at this point.

10:08.672 --> 10:10.997
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:11.174 --> 10:13.047
I need to get...

10:13.592 --> 10:15.252
Thanks.

10:17.387 --> 10:18.880
- Abby?
- Yeah.

10:19.054 --> 10:22.885
- You have a feather.
- I have a...

10:25.434 --> 10:27.307
We had these...

10:28.186 --> 10:30.142
Thank you.

10:34.273 --> 10:36.016
What?

10:38.193 --> 10:40.268
I was just thinking...

10:40.444 --> 10:44.523
I was just wondering, if you wanted,
maybe we could...

10:46.031 --> 10:47.609
We could what?

10:49.701 --> 10:51.325
Go out sometime.

10:53.203 --> 10:55.954
Oh, you mean, like a date?

10:57.498 --> 11:01.708
Yeah. That's sort of
what I was thinking.

11:04.127 --> 11:06.036
Tonight?

11:08.422 --> 11:09.536
Sure. Tonight works.

11:10.132 --> 11:12.373
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:14.384 --> 11:16.590
- See you then.
- Okay.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.469
Romano.

11:25.642 --> 11:28.845
- Peter, back for a visit? How are you?
- How the hell do you think I am?

11:29.020 --> 11:32.185
Well, judging by your demeanor,
I'd say you were a tad dyspeptic.

11:32.355 --> 11:35.558
- You've been trashing me all over town?
- Having trouble landing a job?

11:35.733 --> 11:37.440
- Thanks to you.
- I'm offended.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.731
You've made enemies
all over this hospital.

11:39.902 --> 11:41.894
Why assume I'm the only one
saying negative-?

11:42.070 --> 11:44.062
You're preventing me
from earning a living.

11:44.239 --> 11:46.112
No, actually, I'm willing to help.

11:46.282 --> 11:50.230
- What?
- Your personality sucks...

11:50.409 --> 11:52.401
...but you don't have to prove
that you're a great surgeon.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.696
Now, I am willing to offer you
a per diem position.

11:55.872 --> 11:57.034
- Per diem?
- Yeah.

11:57.206 --> 12:01.498
It has no benefits and even less stature,
but it's yours for the asking.

12:03.919 --> 12:06.374
- You can kiss my ass.
- I take it that's a "no"?

12:06.546 --> 12:10.245
You couldn't pay me enough to work
for you again, you arrogant little prick.

12:10.423 --> 12:13.589
Fair enough. Just keep working
on those people skills, Peter.

12:16.511 --> 12:18.717
- Labs are back on Mr. Mellonston.
- Good.

12:18.888 --> 12:20.678
- Great color.
- Thanks.

12:20.847 --> 12:24.346
UA's full of white cells. He's got
a rip-roaring urinary-tract infection.

12:24.516 --> 12:26.010
Sorry I called you prematurely.

12:26.184 --> 12:28.223
Always happens
with nursing-home patients.

12:28.394 --> 12:32.343
Give an old guy a bad UTI, next thing
you know, he's General MacArthur.

12:32.522 --> 12:36.269
I called the home, and they've
already given his bed away.

12:36.441 --> 12:40.568
- Family members who can take him in?
- He's at the mercy of Social Services.

12:40.736 --> 12:43.689
Hey, back to work! Get back to work!
Come on. Show's over.

12:43.863 --> 12:48.323
Maybe not. He talks like a vet.
If he is one, he could qualify for the VA.

12:48.491 --> 12:50.400
Yeah. That'll take days to process.

12:50.743 --> 12:54.786
I know a caseworker at North Chicago
with pull. Maybe we can transfer today.

12:54.954 --> 12:57.658
- Do you want me to call?
- Sure, if you think it can be done.

12:57.831 --> 13:00.368
Anybody missing an old man
looking for brass cleaner?

13:00.541 --> 13:02.533
He just walked into a pelvic exam.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.203
Mr. Mellonston!

13:05.211 --> 13:07.038
Mr. Mellonston?

13:07.213 --> 13:09.703
- Kerry. Hold on.
- Peter, I thought you'd left us.

13:09.881 --> 13:12.039
I could be talked
into coming down to the ER.

13:12.216 --> 13:14.541
- As an Attending?
- As a liaison to Surgery.

13:14.718 --> 13:18.928
As a resident you went out of your way
to take every procedure away from us.

13:19.096 --> 13:22.464
If you had a surgeon teaching residents,
more procedures would stay here.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.466
- How?
- I could expedite cases to the O. R.

13:24.642 --> 13:26.301
We have surgical residents for that.

13:26.476 --> 13:29.310
Could you tell me if there's
an elderly gentleman in there?

13:29.478 --> 13:31.138
- Does 47 count?
- No. Thank you.

13:31.313 --> 13:32.807
See, I could do scheduling and-

13:32.981 --> 13:35.518
- God knows we could use the help.
- Kerry, hire me.

13:35.691 --> 13:39.853
Look, I'd love to. Get Romano to pay
for it, you got yourself a job.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.352
Trolling for work, Peter?

13:45.323 --> 13:49.236
Dr. Chen. I'm interested to see what
required the interruption of my lunch.

13:49.409 --> 13:52.693
As I explained on the phone,
splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.

13:52.869 --> 13:54.861
- So you'll operate?
- Well... no.

13:55.038 --> 13:57.907
I would if he didn't have Niemann-Pick's.
Snow him and wait.

13:58.081 --> 14:00.204
We can't just let him
slowly bleed to death.

14:00.375 --> 14:04.039
It's a terminal disease. Surgery will
only slightly delay the inevitable.

14:04.211 --> 14:08.077
If the surgery were successful, then the
family would have more time with him.

14:08.255 --> 14:11.089
And if wishes were horses,
we'd all be knee-deep in crap.

14:11.257 --> 14:13.794
I didn't become a surgeon
to torture dying children.

14:13.967 --> 14:16.921
- Let the boy die in peace.
- But the mother wants it.

14:17.095 --> 14:19.929
No surgery, Dr. Chen.

14:22.390 --> 14:25.805
- What the hell is this?
- Explosion at a hair salon.

14:25.976 --> 14:31.217
Sad cultural commentary, isn't it?
Pursuit of beauty at all costs.

14:31.521 --> 14:32.636
Nice legs, though.

14:32.814 --> 14:34.605
There you go.

14:35.232 --> 14:39.229
- Oh, God! What am I going to do?
- It probably won't scar.

14:39.402 --> 14:42.153
But they look hideous.
I can't go on stage like this.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.902
- Can you wear pants?
- Not in the swimsuit competition.

14:46.073 --> 14:48.279
You know, you probably think
this is so stupid.

14:48.450 --> 14:52.316
I'm just trying to win a scholarship.
I'm premed.

14:52.911 --> 14:55.484
I can give you something
for the pain if you'd like.

14:55.663 --> 14:58.153
It's okay.
They look worse than they feel.

14:58.332 --> 15:01.036
Okay. Excuse me.

15:01.209 --> 15:03.663
Can you get ahold of Miss Pruitt
at Abbott and Sons?

15:03.835 --> 15:06.919
- Oh, yeah. Miss Pruitt. You mean that-
- Don't ask. Just do it.

15:07.088 --> 15:09.578
Hey, Dave? Did you find anybody yet?

15:09.756 --> 15:11.333
- For what?
- For hockey tonight.

15:11.507 --> 15:16.583
Yeah. A friend of mine. He might sign on.
Former pro, just looking for exercise.

15:16.761 --> 15:17.792
Oh, okay.

15:17.970 --> 15:21.338
- It's a rough game we play, actually-
- So you don't think I can handle it.

15:21.514 --> 15:25.131
- I didn't say that.
- I used to play varsity, second line.

15:25.309 --> 15:28.474
Well, if he can't make it, I'll call you.

15:28.644 --> 15:32.427
Type and cross for four. Start two units
of O-neg on the rapid infuser.

15:32.605 --> 15:36.139
- What happened?
- Multiple GSWs, one to the chest.

15:36.316 --> 15:38.143
Looks like a hemopneumothorax.

15:38.318 --> 15:40.689
Five hundred cc's out.

15:41.153 --> 15:45.363
- Lost the pulse. Starting compressions.
- We need to crack her chest.

15:45.865 --> 15:49.778
Right-sided GSW's an indication
for the sternal saw. Can I do it?

15:49.951 --> 15:52.737
Next time, Carter. 10 blade.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.534
Hold CPR.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.991
Sternal saw.

16:02.584 --> 16:05.157
- She needs a central line.
- I'll do it.

16:07.421 --> 16:09.497
Mr. Mellonston?

16:09.714 --> 16:12.086
Mr. Mellonston?

16:12.842 --> 16:14.668
Mr. Mellonston.

16:14.843 --> 16:20.714
He said he lost his razor on Old Baldy,
wanted to borrow mine.

16:21.264 --> 16:25.925
Gil didn't really need it though.
All he had was peach fuzz.

16:26.101 --> 16:28.673
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

16:28.853 --> 16:31.853
A mortar shell took his head off.

16:32.022 --> 16:35.105
Why don't we take you back
to your bed so you can rest, okay?

16:35.274 --> 16:36.851
Here we go.

16:38.860 --> 16:44.018
- You've seen war, haven't you?
- Actually, no. I have not.

16:45.698 --> 16:48.022
But you've seen men die.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.028
Yes.

16:52.703 --> 16:58.324
Mr. Mellonston, I'm afraid I have
some rather unfortunate news.

16:58.498 --> 17:00.537
You've lost your bed
at the nursing home.

17:00.708 --> 17:03.910
But we've already called the VA
to see if we can find a placement.

17:04.085 --> 17:06.457
- They won't take me!
- I'm sure that you qualify.

17:06.628 --> 17:08.205
- I won't go there!
- Please try-

17:08.380 --> 17:11.464
- I can't go there! I won't!
- Calm down. We're only trying to help.

17:11.632 --> 17:14.751
- I can't go there! I won't!
- Malik! Malik, come over-!

17:15.676 --> 17:18.214
No, please!
Don't let them take me!

17:18.387 --> 17:22.300
Don't let them take me away.
Please.

17:25.934 --> 17:29.551
His nose stopped bleeding.
What'd you find out?

17:32.022 --> 17:37.145
Well, the surgeon feels that it's
too great a risk to operate on Kenneth.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.558
But he's suffering.
Can't you see that?

17:39.735 --> 17:42.272
Ms. Stein,
Kenneth is barely conscious.

17:42.445 --> 17:46.572
That's not true! He squeezes my hand.
He understands me.

17:46.740 --> 17:49.740
That means everything that
can be done should be done.

17:49.909 --> 17:54.237
Yes. But there's a good chance that
Kenneth won't survive the operation.

17:55.871 --> 17:57.910
I know what you're thinking.

17:58.081 --> 17:59.824
I'm selfish.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.663
I'm keeping my son alive for me,
not him.

18:02.835 --> 18:05.407
- Ms. Stein, I'm not thinking-
- He's my child.

18:06.504 --> 18:10.002
I want every minute I can with him.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.836
Wait till you're a mother,
then you'll know.

18:15.593 --> 18:17.253
Get him the surgery.

18:19.304 --> 18:22.921
Looks like a small-caliber GSW
to the right ventricle.

18:23.099 --> 18:25.589
Okay. That should do it.

18:31.479 --> 18:34.230
- Heart's not filling.
- She's had five units.

18:34.398 --> 18:36.935
- We need more volume.
- Prep the paddles.

18:37.108 --> 18:40.725
Can't shock an empty heart.
You'll never get her back.

18:41.403 --> 18:44.736
- Run in another two units.
- Give me some 0 silk.

18:44.905 --> 18:48.108
- Hold compressions.
- What are you doing, Carter?

18:48.408 --> 18:50.483
Beck's suture.

18:50.659 --> 18:54.822
All right. Keep traction on that.
I'll check the back side of the heart.

18:54.996 --> 18:56.869
What do you see?

18:57.831 --> 19:00.997
Exit wound in the left ventricle.
Give me 2-0 silk.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.242
- I can repair it.
- Not from that side.

19:03.418 --> 19:04.995
I have a better angle here.

19:06.379 --> 19:11.335
I saw blood welling up behind the heart.
I thought there might be another hole.

19:11.632 --> 19:13.708
- Okay.
- Charge to 20.

19:15.260 --> 19:16.540
Okay, now cut it.

19:21.014 --> 19:22.342
Clear.

19:22.974 --> 19:24.800
Still V-fib.

19:24.975 --> 19:26.967
Okay. Charge to 30. Clear.

19:29.186 --> 19:31.558
Got a rhythm. Sinus tach.

19:31.730 --> 19:34.220
- Got a pulse.
- Nice job, Carter.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.104
Notify the O.R. She's got
a septal defect they need to repair.

19:38.276 --> 19:42.189
Dr. Kovac, Mrs. Danzer's having more
chest pain, dropped her pressure to 90.

19:42.362 --> 19:45.148
I'll be right there.
Are you gonna take her up?

19:45.322 --> 19:48.904
Sterile saline dressings
and hang the FFP.

19:49.075 --> 19:52.408
- Great save, Carter. Very slick.
- Thanks.

19:52.828 --> 19:56.824
- Ativan?
- Yeah, point 5. He's pretty subdued.

20:04.127 --> 20:06.796
- Did you hear from the VA?
- There's good news and bad news.

20:06.962 --> 20:11.422
I found Mr. Mellonston a bed.
But it's in a brig. He's AWOL.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.167
AWOL? From where?

20:14.343 --> 20:18.802
Korean War. 1951, Army corporal.
Deserted on leave.

20:18.971 --> 20:23.133
Unfortunately, my VA contact took it
upon himself to notify the active military.

20:23.307 --> 20:26.177
Why would they care about someone
who deserted 50 years ago?

20:26.351 --> 20:28.841
Who knows? They may want
to slap him on the wrist.

20:29.019 --> 20:32.850
- They may want to court-martial him.
- For God's sake! He's 72 years old.

20:33.022 --> 20:34.220
I know.

20:35.524 --> 20:40.398
- Is there anything we can do?
- Legally? No.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.697
Peter, what are you doing here?

20:50.034 --> 20:51.860
Did you get any of my messages?

20:52.035 --> 20:56.530
Yes. And I meant to call you.
I've just been incredibly busy.

20:59.749 --> 21:02.204
I just didn't know what to say.

21:02.584 --> 21:04.375
Yeah. Well, it's okay.

21:04.544 --> 21:08.671
No. No, it's not okay.
I've been avoiding you for days.

21:09.047 --> 21:10.292
Yeah. I got that.

21:12.633 --> 21:16.629
I'm sorry. What Robert did was wrong.
And I've told him as much.

21:16.803 --> 21:18.925
I just wish there was
something I could do.

21:19.096 --> 21:22.428
Well, I didn't exactly expect you
to resign in protest.

21:22.598 --> 21:24.590
That's a relief.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.387
There is something you can do.
You can put the word out.

21:28.561 --> 21:31.395
I know you've got a lot of contacts
at other hospitals.

21:31.563 --> 21:35.013
Of course. I'm surprised you
haven't been snapped up already.

21:35.190 --> 21:39.981
Yeah. Well, it seems that lately
my reputation has taken a hit.

21:41.111 --> 21:43.399
He's a horrid little turd, isn't he?

21:45.864 --> 21:50.240
You know what? I spoke with a friend in
Philadelphia who's looking for someone.

21:50.409 --> 21:54.655
- I just wasn't sure you'd care to move.
- At this point, I'm open to anything.

21:54.829 --> 21:59.075
- Dr. Benton, they need you in the ER.
- I no longer work at this hospital.

21:59.249 --> 22:02.581
Weaver called.
Your sister Jackie is down there.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.746
- What was the last BP?
-100/60.

22:07.921 --> 22:11.455
- Okay, let's go.
- I'll grab the drug box.

22:12.675 --> 22:14.003
- How is she?
- Who are you?

22:14.176 --> 22:15.420
Her sister.

22:15.593 --> 22:17.834
She was shot in the chest.
She's critical.

22:18.012 --> 22:20.584
She needs surgery.
You can go wait in the-

22:24.099 --> 22:26.720
- Oh, Lord!
- What happened?

22:28.102 --> 22:31.801
- Call Security now!
- Oh, my God! Carter! Are you all right?

22:31.980 --> 22:35.229
- Heart stopped beating.
- I'll start compressions.

22:35.399 --> 22:38.434
- Any rhythm?
- Agonal at 34. Looks like P.E.A.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.182
Amp of atropine, amp of epi.
Mix up the dopamine.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.519
That girl must've been a gangbanger.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.154
Chest is dry.

22:45.698 --> 22:49.564
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
There's gray matter everywhere.

22:49.742 --> 22:52.197
You won't get her back.
Blew her brains out.

22:52.369 --> 22:54.491
Hyperventilators, 70 of mannitol.

22:54.662 --> 22:56.868
Check cold-water calorics,
and we'll call it.

22:57.039 --> 22:58.616
Somebody call the police!

23:04.878 --> 23:06.704
- What happened?
- Jesse got into a fight.

23:06.879 --> 23:08.077
You don't know, all right?

23:08.255 --> 23:10.294
I was surprised when
they said you were here.

23:10.465 --> 23:12.421
I had to take care of something.
How is he?

23:12.591 --> 23:16.089
Superficial lac above the eyebrow,
mild periorbital swelling...

23:16.260 --> 23:18.632
...but no bony deformity or tenderness.

23:18.804 --> 23:20.677
- Nothing serious.
- Told you.

23:20.847 --> 23:25.342
- He was bleeding pretty bad.
- Did you hit your head? Pass out?

23:25.517 --> 23:28.967
He slammed me into the locker once,
all right? That's all.

23:29.144 --> 23:31.386
- You get a CT?
- No. You think he needs one?

23:31.563 --> 23:32.594
Maybe.

23:32.772 --> 23:35.938
There was no LOC,
no focal neuro deficits.

23:36.108 --> 23:38.313
With head injuries,
you can't be too careful.

23:38.484 --> 23:41.603
Jackie, he's fine. He's fine.

23:44.155 --> 23:47.321
Come on. Hey, Jackie.
How about I buy you a cup of coffee?

23:47.490 --> 23:49.150
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

23:57.247 --> 24:00.164
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

24:01.584 --> 24:04.702
- They found the shooter.
- Good.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.166
Only 15 years old.

24:08.797 --> 24:10.588
Why don't you go home?

24:11.966 --> 24:13.757
I'll be all right.

24:13.925 --> 24:19.345
Go home. You've probably seen
enough trauma for one day.

24:24.308 --> 24:26.465
I'll tell Kerry.

24:36.316 --> 24:38.937
- He's a teenager. It's normal stuff.
- No, he's changed.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.351
You're just not around enough
to notice anymore.

24:41.528 --> 24:42.559
What does that mean?

24:42.737 --> 24:45.441
He's got a girlfriend now.
She's pretty rough.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.902
- You try talking to him?
- We've tried everything.

24:48.074 --> 24:50.280
Grounding him is a joke.
He goes out anyway.

24:50.451 --> 24:53.570
I can't have him locked up.
The other day he shoved his father.

24:53.745 --> 24:56.282
Took everything Walter had not to-

24:58.540 --> 24:59.998
You all right?

25:02.918 --> 25:05.206
Can you talk to him?

25:05.795 --> 25:07.253
Can you try?

25:07.546 --> 25:09.585
Talking to him?

25:10.631 --> 25:13.122
Maybe he'll listen to you.

25:19.554 --> 25:23.053
- You look nice.
- Thank you. You too.

25:23.224 --> 25:26.307
So, what did you have in mind?
Dinner? Movie?

25:26.476 --> 25:29.144
I was thinking of something
a little more physical.

25:29.311 --> 25:31.517
Not if you go in laparoscopically.

25:31.688 --> 25:34.178
Recovery time is reduced
and he gains back weeks...

25:34.356 --> 25:36.395
...maybe even months of his life.

25:36.941 --> 25:41.732
I don't understand. Are you saying it's
too risky for you or for the patient?

25:42.904 --> 25:45.110
Yeah, whatever. Thank you.

25:45.614 --> 25:48.151
- Problems?
- Can't find a surgeon.

25:48.324 --> 25:51.241
- Is our department booked?
- No. Just uninterested.

25:51.410 --> 25:54.161
- This your kid with Niemann-Pick's?
- Yeah.

25:54.328 --> 25:55.988
Tough situation.

25:56.497 --> 25:58.903
I all but promised his mother
I'd make this happen.

25:59.082 --> 26:02.580
- Now you can't?
- There are a few other people I can try.

26:02.751 --> 26:05.241
But you know they'll turn you down.

26:05.419 --> 26:11.005
You know, sometimes as much as we
like to give it, hope can be cruel.

26:12.508 --> 26:13.752
Dr. Greene.

26:15.510 --> 26:16.541
Think fast!

26:23.557 --> 26:25.763
8:00, tonight. You're in.

26:27.185 --> 26:29.307
I can't believe the VA
is moving this quickly.

26:29.478 --> 26:31.351
They're not.
I got him into another home.

26:31.521 --> 26:34.355
Borrowed a Social Security number
from a corpse at the morgue.

26:34.523 --> 26:36.100
- Sour cream and onion?
- No, thank you.

26:36.274 --> 26:38.350
You borrowed a number
from a deceased person?

26:38.526 --> 26:41.230
- Yeah. We do it all the time.
- I don't wanna know this.

26:41.403 --> 26:43.727
- You said you felt bad.
- That is not the point.

26:43.905 --> 26:46.691
I work with many elderly homeless.
You learn a few tricks.

26:46.865 --> 26:48.608
- Not another word, please!
- You have to.

26:48.783 --> 26:51.487
- Dr. Weaver, time for that seminar.
- Thank you, Frank.

26:51.660 --> 26:54.577
- "Advances in Neuroleptic Therapy"?
- Yeah. How did you know?

26:54.745 --> 26:57.117
I'll be there. Save you a seat.

26:57.956 --> 27:01.999
- So where is this body?
- The patient is right here.

27:02.167 --> 27:03.744
- Audrey?
- Can I go home now?

27:03.918 --> 27:06.705
Not yet. This is Miss Pruitt,
and she's here to help you.

27:06.879 --> 27:08.373
She's an expert cosmetologist.

27:08.547 --> 27:11.037
Can you cover all of this
in time for the pageant?

27:11.215 --> 27:15.710
- Honey, I've worked on worse. Trust me.
- Yeah, but I've got open wounds.

27:15.885 --> 27:20.095
You're on antibiotics. But afterwards,
no makeup until you're fully healed.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.089
- Thank you, Dr. Greene.
- Good luck.

27:22.264 --> 27:23.295
Thanks.

27:23.474 --> 27:25.928
Isn't that the gal who does makeup
on dead people?

27:26.100 --> 27:27.179
Whatever works.

27:27.351 --> 27:31.134
Mark, there you are. You know we
were meant to leave half an hour ago?

27:31.312 --> 27:33.719
- For what?
- We're looking at artwork tonight.

27:33.898 --> 27:35.973
- I'm subbing in a hockey game.
- What?

27:36.149 --> 27:39.149
- Malucci. He asked me to play hockey.
- Malucci? Are you mad?

27:40.235 --> 27:41.610
What?

27:41.778 --> 27:44.351
You never said one word to me
about hockey before.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.321
You never asked.

27:47.615 --> 27:51.991
- Do you play well?
- Well, why don't you come find out?

27:54.579 --> 27:57.247
You could wear your sweater,
you could bring some pompoms.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.956
I'd be in uniform.

27:59.123 --> 28:02.740
I didn't know sports
had this effect on you.

28:16.844 --> 28:20.508
- Has something happened?
- No, why?

28:20.888 --> 28:23.758
- You're home early.
- Yep.

28:24.141 --> 28:28.766
- You never leave the hospital early.
- Someone fax you my schedule?

28:29.478 --> 28:33.854
I know when you left this morning.
And I know the kind of hours you put in.

28:34.023 --> 28:36.015
It was slow, so they sent me home.

28:36.399 --> 28:38.936
- So it's been all right?
- Yep.

28:39.109 --> 28:43.023
- What you expected?
- I'm hungry.

28:43.196 --> 28:46.231
How about you? Have you eaten?
I'll take you to Dominic's.

28:46.406 --> 28:51.861
John, to be honest, I hoped that you
would feel so uncomfortable there...

28:52.035 --> 28:53.861
...that you wouldn't want to stay.

28:54.036 --> 28:57.570
- I know.
- So I wouldn't have to ask you not to.

28:57.747 --> 29:00.582
Well, then don't. Just give me
five minutes. I'll get changed.

29:00.749 --> 29:02.457
John.

29:03.752 --> 29:05.874
I know your heart is in the right place.

29:06.045 --> 29:10.255
I know you enjoy being a doctor.
Start a practice.

29:10.423 --> 29:12.545
I'm not fighting you on that anymore.

29:12.716 --> 29:14.874
Can't we just agree
to disagree on this?

29:15.051 --> 29:18.668
No. There are other ways
to help people.

29:18.845 --> 29:20.754
You don't have to destroy yourself.

29:20.930 --> 29:24.215
- Gamma-
- That place nearly killed you, John.

29:25.100 --> 29:28.717
It killed your friend.
It drove you to drugs.

29:28.894 --> 29:32.593
- No. I did that on my own.
- You don't owe them anything.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.934
You don't have to prove anything.
You have a beautiful spirit.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.978
I've seen them beat
that spirit out of you.

29:40.152 --> 29:45.061
Gamma, I'm gonna be fine.
I promise.

29:47.157 --> 29:49.908
I wish I could believe you.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.202
Gamma?

30:00.875 --> 30:03.199
Wait. Stop spinning.
You're not supposed to spin.

30:03.376 --> 30:05.949
How am I supposed to keep you from...?

30:10.256 --> 30:13.090
- It's all in the wrists, really.
- I think I pulled a muscle.

30:13.258 --> 30:16.507
- Oh, maybe we should take a break.
- Good idea.

30:21.764 --> 30:23.009
Draft, please. Abby?

30:23.182 --> 30:26.051
- Oh, can I have a club soda?
- Club soda.

30:26.225 --> 30:30.601
So next time I choose the sport.
Something more civilized.

30:30.770 --> 30:33.889
- Such as...?
- There's a pool table at my hotel.

30:34.606 --> 30:39.267
- Your hotel?
- Yeah. I don't own it. I just live there.

30:39.443 --> 30:41.850
- You live in a hotel?
- Yeah. As a doctor.

30:42.195 --> 30:46.143
I take care of the tourists.
They give me a break on the rent.

30:47.782 --> 30:53.367
No, it's a good deal. I mean,
maid service, laundry, amenities...

30:53.703 --> 30:57.237
No, it's great.
You'll have to come see it.

30:57.414 --> 30:59.572
- Your hotel room?
- Yeah.

30:59.957 --> 31:02.626
I mean- I mean, no. I mean-

31:02.792 --> 31:05.627
I'd never ask such a thing of a lady.

31:05.795 --> 31:10.455
- Well, especially after just one kiss.
- No. I should hope not.

31:26.309 --> 31:29.262
Of course, that makes it two.

31:30.979 --> 31:32.805
Come on, rematch.

31:35.565 --> 31:39.728
- We out of here, or not?
- Yeah. After we talk.

31:39.902 --> 31:41.443
About what?

31:42.445 --> 31:45.114
Your mom says you've been
hanging out a lot lately.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.150
- So?
- So she worries about you.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.906
She worries about everything.
That's what she does.

31:52.118 --> 31:55.818
- You got new friends?
- New girl. That's it.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.450
- Using a condom?
- Uncle Peter-

31:59.624 --> 32:02.956
- I'm serious.
- I'm not stupid.

32:04.544 --> 32:05.658
Good.

32:09.464 --> 32:12.001
I'm not doing anything, all right?

32:12.174 --> 32:15.921
It's just...
I'm a man, you know?

32:16.093 --> 32:19.876
And my folks just can't get
used to it. That's all.

32:20.596 --> 32:23.680
Well, maybe they would
if you treated them with respect.

32:23.849 --> 32:25.924
You mean do what they say.

32:26.100 --> 32:29.515
Look, sometimes you gotta do
what you don't wanna do.

32:29.686 --> 32:31.678
That's part of being a man.

32:31.854 --> 32:37.191
- Peter, do you have a minute?
- Yeah. Hold on a second, okay?

32:37.358 --> 32:40.358
Just do what your mother says.
All right?

32:49.200 --> 32:52.698
- That job's yours if you want it.
- Are you serious?

32:52.869 --> 32:56.035
You're a full Surgical Attending
on the academic track.

32:56.205 --> 32:57.947
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy for you.

32:58.123 --> 33:01.039
- What's all the celebrating about?
- I got a job.

33:01.208 --> 33:02.453
That's great!

33:02.626 --> 33:04.914
Elizabeth pulled some strings
with her friend.

33:05.086 --> 33:06.117
Where?

33:06.295 --> 33:08.370
Hahnemann.
They made me a full Attending.

33:08.546 --> 33:09.744
In Philadelphia.

33:09.922 --> 33:13.373
- Anyway, he's expecting your call.
- Oh. Right, right. Thanks.

33:13.550 --> 33:14.925
Sure.

33:16.886 --> 33:20.218
I didn't have much of a choice.
I mean, I'm being blackballed here.

33:20.388 --> 33:23.305
- When will I see you?
- Well, it's only an hour by air.

33:23.473 --> 33:25.964
- We'll work something out.
- I guess so.

33:26.142 --> 33:28.679
- You coming home with us?
- No, I gotta make a stop.

33:28.852 --> 33:31.556
- Can you do me a favor and take him?
- Of course.

33:35.357 --> 33:37.349
I'll call you.

33:39.359 --> 33:40.557
Okay.

33:40.735 --> 33:42.313
- What?
- All I'm saying is:

33:42.487 --> 33:44.692
You were at four
and then you were at six.

33:44.863 --> 33:49.074
That's because I scored very quickly.
You're a bad sport.

33:49.241 --> 33:52.858
- I can't handle losing to a girl, okay?
- Oh, no.

33:53.036 --> 33:55.608
I'm kidding. I actually enjoyed
losing to you, Abby.

33:55.788 --> 33:59.072
Thank you. Thank you.
That's much better.

33:59.290 --> 34:01.412
Your hands are freezing.
You wanna catch a cab?

34:01.583 --> 34:04.334
No. This is strolling weather
in Minnesota.

34:04.502 --> 34:07.039
- Is that where home is?
- It's where I grew up-

34:07.212 --> 34:08.587
Luka!

34:09.589 --> 34:11.913
Give me your purse.
Give me the purse.

34:12.091 --> 34:14.960
- Give me the damn- Give me the purse!
- Take it.

34:24.099 --> 34:27.099
Luka! Luka, stop!

34:27.268 --> 34:30.101
Stop! Luka, stop!

34:30.270 --> 34:31.679
Stop it!

34:50.784 --> 34:51.898
Let's play the game!

34:52.784 --> 34:54.576
You okay, Dr. Greene?

34:56.288 --> 34:58.695
I thought you said this was
a no-check league.

34:58.873 --> 35:02.122
- There's no such thing.
- Thanks for the tip.

35:07.921 --> 35:10.791
- Hi. I thought you'd left.
- Briefly.

35:11.465 --> 35:14.169
You know, you don't need
to finish your shift.

35:14.342 --> 35:16.879
I still got a couple hours left.

35:17.970 --> 35:22.713
Carter, I think that you'd be
better served by taking it easy.

35:22.890 --> 35:27.431
I'll go to a meeting after my shift's over.
If that's okay with you?

35:27.601 --> 35:29.309
I need to finish.

35:29.561 --> 35:33.095
All right. But not too much.
Keep it to minor medical.

35:33.272 --> 35:37.220
- Thank you. Have a nice night.
- You too.

35:38.484 --> 35:41.104
- What's open?
- Trauma 2.

35:42.653 --> 35:45.653
- I thought you two went home.
- This guy attacked us.

35:45.822 --> 35:48.277
Blunt head trauma with LOC.
GCS of eight.

35:48.449 --> 35:51.118
Three seizures en route.
He's had four of Ativan.

35:51.284 --> 35:52.695
- You're bleeding.
- I'm all right.

35:52.869 --> 35:53.948
BP 180/100.

35:54.120 --> 35:58.745
I'll take it from here. Luka.
Get someone to take care of him.

35:58.915 --> 36:02.164
- Hey, Carter! I need you in here!
- Dr. Weaver doesn't want-

36:02.334 --> 36:05.334
I don't care. Get in here now.
We've got a major head trauma.

36:05.503 --> 36:08.835
On my count. One, two, three.

36:10.131 --> 36:11.328
He's seizing.

36:11.507 --> 36:14.542
Two of Ativan. CBC, chem panel,
coags, type and cross for four.

36:14.717 --> 36:16.294
Give me suction. He's vomiting.

36:16.468 --> 36:20.761
- Get X-ray in here for a C-spine.
- All right. I'll stabilize the neck.

36:20.930 --> 36:23.764
Ativan's on board. Still seizing.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.429
Hey, Carla.

36:30.645 --> 36:33.349
- Peter.
- We need to talk.

36:33.522 --> 36:36.191
- Here, okay? Really busy tonight.
- Sure.

36:36.357 --> 36:38.764
- Here you go. Pick it up.
- Table eight first.

36:39.818 --> 36:43.020
The hospital said Reece could stay
until the end of the month.

36:43.195 --> 36:45.864
That gives us more time
to find another daycare center.

36:46.031 --> 36:48.319
It'll be hard finding him
a place he loves more.

36:48.491 --> 36:52.819
I know. Listen, I just got an Attending
position at Hahnemann in Philadelphia.

36:52.994 --> 36:55.401
Really? Good for you.

36:55.579 --> 36:58.365
So we just need to work out
Reece's visitation schedule.

36:58.539 --> 37:01.705
Maybe he could fly down
every other weekend or something.

37:02.500 --> 37:08.252
I'm sorry. You're not suggesting I put
my son on a plane by himself, are you?

37:08.421 --> 37:13.662
- Carla, we have joint custody.
- In Chicago.

37:14.634 --> 37:16.044
I already took the job.

37:16.218 --> 37:18.625
Wish that had worked for me
when I wanted to move.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.757
That was Germany, nine hours away.
That's completely different.

37:21.931 --> 37:24.931
- No. It is completely the same.
- What is this about? Payback?

37:25.099 --> 37:29.677
It's about our agreement. Now, either
you stay local, or you give up custody.

37:29.853 --> 37:31.560
I can't find a decent position here.

37:31.729 --> 37:35.678
That's right. You have your career
to think of. The rest of us just have jobs.

37:35.857 --> 37:37.102
Table six needs more bread.

37:37.275 --> 37:39.516
This is the only way for me
to keep my momentum.

37:39.693 --> 37:43.392
- Yes. And Germany was Roger's.
- Carla, I'm asking you not to do this.

37:43.571 --> 37:47.781
I'm not doing anything.
I'm just playing by your rules.

38:00.082 --> 38:04.873
Hang Dilantin. One gram
per 1000 of saline.

38:10.798 --> 38:14.296
- It looks pretty deep. You need suturing.
- I'm okay.

38:15.176 --> 38:18.259
- Someone should sew it up, Luka.
- I'm okay.

38:18.428 --> 38:20.052
Dr. Kovac?

38:20.763 --> 38:23.432
Detective Stetler.
Can I have a moment?

38:28.310 --> 38:30.302
Can you tell me
exactly what happened?

38:30.478 --> 38:32.885
We were walking by the river.
He jumped us.

38:33.063 --> 38:35.600
- Was there only one assailant?
- Yeah.

38:37.275 --> 38:40.607
- Seizing stopped at 2142.
- Lateral neck looks good.

38:40.777 --> 38:43.611
We need some more Kerlix.
He's soaked through these.

38:43.779 --> 38:46.400
We got a pumper. Curved Kelly.

38:46.573 --> 38:50.106
Pressure's sky-high, 260/140.
Pulse down to 42.

38:50.284 --> 38:53.568
Start the Nipride.
Blown right pupil. He's herniating.

38:53.744 --> 38:57.278
Eighty of mannitol.
Prep for a posterior burr hole.

38:57.455 --> 39:02.281
Hurry up, Carter. I need you to assist.
Perforator drill with a chisel-point bit.

39:02.459 --> 39:04.581
- Damn it, tie that off!
- I'm trying!

39:04.752 --> 39:06.246
Stick a finger on it!

39:06.420 --> 39:08.875
V- tach. No pulse.
Starting chest compressions.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.371
- Charge to 200.
- Carter, can you grab the paddles?

39:11.548 --> 39:14.383
- I'm controlling the bleeder.
- Get a pressure dressing on it.

39:14.550 --> 39:18.381
- Give me those four-by-fours. Come on.
- Haleh, I need that drill.

39:19.679 --> 39:21.221
- Okay.
- Clear.

39:22.681 --> 39:25.432
I didn't see him coming.

39:26.767 --> 39:29.139
After he hit you from behind,
what happened?

39:29.311 --> 39:30.970
I went down.

39:31.812 --> 39:34.682
- Did he take your wallet?
- Yeah.

39:34.856 --> 39:39.102
- And you felt your life was in danger.
- Mine and hers.

39:40.152 --> 39:42.274
Did he threaten to hurt you?

39:43.696 --> 39:45.237
I'm not sure.

39:45.530 --> 39:48.103
Did he say, "Give me your money,
or I'll kill you"?

39:48.282 --> 39:49.942
He had a pipe.

39:51.284 --> 39:53.609
He was going after Abby.

39:56.204 --> 40:00.117
- And you can corroborate that?
- Yeah.

40:00.624 --> 40:04.288
Let's wait and see what happens.
Seems pretty clear it was self-defense.

40:04.460 --> 40:06.582
Shouldn't be a problem, doc.

40:21.805 --> 40:24.924
There. That's the inner table.
Irrigate the bone dust.

40:25.099 --> 40:28.183
- Looks like a subdural.
- More irrigation, Carter. 11 blade.

40:28.352 --> 40:31.305
- Five minutes since the last epi.
- Give another amp.

40:31.479 --> 40:35.178
Opening the dura.
Get ready to suction.

40:35.482 --> 40:38.186
- Can you see the source?
- No.

40:38.776 --> 40:42.986
Let's just pack it off.
What's the rhythm?

40:43.154 --> 40:45.192
- V-fib.
- Charge to 300.

40:45.363 --> 40:46.822
I need saline gauze.

40:46.990 --> 40:48.697
Clear.

40:50.700 --> 40:53.570
- Sinus brady at 50.
- Got a pulse.

40:53.744 --> 40:55.701
Excellent.
Decompress the brain.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.863
Amp of atropine.
Let's check the pupils.

41:01.291 --> 41:05.039
- How about phenobarb?
- Go with pentobarb, 200, slow IV push.

41:05.211 --> 41:09.041
- That'll induce a coma, you know.
- It's either that or watch him die.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.544
Abby told me about what happened.
Can I take a look?

41:14.717 --> 41:16.377
It's superficial.

41:16.552 --> 41:19.801
- Did you lose consciousness?
- For a moment, yeah.

41:19.971 --> 41:22.378
- Come on. Let's fix you up.
- No.

41:22.723 --> 41:25.972
- Do you have a headache?
- Leave me alone!

41:28.727 --> 41:31.134
I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.

42:29.811 --> 42:31.186
Clear.

42:33.814 --> 42:35.770
Still V-fib.

42:38.859 --> 42:41.775
- How long's the bretylium been on board?
- Five minutes.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.028
Clear.

42:47.198 --> 42:50.613
Asystole. What now?

42:50.867 --> 42:54.698
- Open up the dopamine.
- It's been 45 minutes.

42:55.329 --> 42:56.609
I know.

43:29.144 --> 43:31.136
Luka, wait!

43:35.273 --> 43:37.146
Luka, wait.
