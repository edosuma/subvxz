<i>Previously on Dance Academy...</i>
Welcome to second year.

00:04.154 --> 00:07.222
In second year,
there are no second chances.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.051
Did anyone ever think
we'd make it this far?

00:12.170 --> 00:14.142
- Sorry.
- No, no, it's fine.

00:14.162 --> 00:17.150
My new holding cell's just around
the corner. It'll be like old times.

00:17.170 --> 00:20.190
I put undue pressure on myself last
year by alienating those around me.

00:20.206 --> 00:22.214
So you've decided to be nice?

00:23.134 --> 00:25.166
You people with your feelings
are messed up.

00:25.182 --> 00:26.198
Move!

00:26.214 --> 00:28.166
Good, you're both here.

00:28.182 --> 00:30.154
This is my goddaughter, Grace.

00:30.174 --> 00:33.206
When she danced in London, it was...
The Royal Ballet School.

00:33.226 --> 00:36.174
So you're staying?
For now.

00:36.194 --> 00:40.134
Let's make a deal.
Nothing's getting in between us.

00:41.202 --> 00:42.506
Deal.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.226
My Nanna used to say...

01:42.146 --> 01:44.170
and she totally stole it
from someone else...

01:44.186 --> 01:46.154
that the key to happiness was...

01:47.218 --> 01:49.150
having something to do...

01:49.170 --> 01:52.142
Shh!
It's work.

01:54.146 --> 01:57.174
Something to love

01:57.190 --> 01:59.198
and something to dream about.

01:59.218 --> 02:02.194
Can you believe
that's going to be us one day?

02:19.210 --> 02:22.146
I used to think the moment
I got into the National Academy,

02:22.166 --> 02:24.162
I would die on the spot
with happiness.

02:28.202 --> 02:30.206
I didn't.

02:32.166 --> 02:35.150
Five seconds later, I just started
focussing on the next dream...

02:38.226 --> 02:41.158
getting a contract
with the Company.

02:49.226 --> 02:51.170
I don't know.

02:51.190 --> 02:53.923
Maybe I'm destined to always
want something just out of reach.

03:08.198 --> 03:10.174
Hi, guys.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.047
I thought I'd get in early

03:12.142 --> 03:14.170
and let you know that whatever
the initiation ceremony is,

03:14.222 --> 03:16.214
I'm... I'm in.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.146
I'm Kat Karamakov.

03:19.162 --> 03:22.194
I'm new... obviously.

03:29.150 --> 03:32.202
Minus nine minutes
to make it to my shift.

03:32.218 --> 03:34.178
That's doable.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.158
Samuel, I do hope those outside
work commitments aren't continuing

03:38.174 --> 03:39.206
now that term has resumed.

03:39.222 --> 03:41.154
No, of course not.

03:41.174 --> 03:43.154
Who's got time
with the Academy schedule?

03:43.170 --> 03:44.210
My point exactly.

03:44.230 --> 03:49.198
Mr Reed, I've been thinking
we don't spend enough time together.

03:49.214 --> 03:51.226
So have I.

03:52.142 --> 03:53.190
Your office?

03:53.210 --> 03:57.222
Picture a universe
full of shiny, happy people.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.230
The boredom is palpable.

04:00.146 --> 04:01.178
Hi?

04:01.198 --> 04:03.198
Um, sorry again
that we got off on the wrong foot.

04:03.218 --> 04:06.146
I thought maybe I could
take you over to the cafe,

04:06.166 --> 04:09.134
show you some of
the least disgusting menu options.

04:09.150 --> 04:10.194
Yeah, sorry.

04:10.214 --> 04:14.214
Yeah, I would take anyone remotely
interesting at this point.

04:20.173 --> 04:22.142
Do I know you?

04:22.162 --> 04:27.138
I'm Lulu and this is Lily and we've
been dying to meet you all week.

04:27.154 --> 04:29.012
You're a legend down in first year.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.182
The Clara costume sabotage?

04:30.202 --> 04:33.194
Emailing Tara's pros and cons list
around the entire school.

04:33.214 --> 04:36.190
Inspired.
Plus, you dumped Sammy Lieberman.

04:36.206 --> 04:38.206
That rat infected all of first year.

04:38.226 --> 04:41.194
So we've decided that you're
the only second year with any clue.

04:41.210 --> 04:44.146
No more relationships, just ballet.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.146
Eye on the Company prize
at all times.

04:47.182 --> 04:49.182
If there's a point,
could you make it?

04:49.198 --> 04:52.142
We want to watch you and learn.

04:53.154 --> 04:56.174
I appreciate your taste, girls.

04:56.190 --> 04:58.174
I don't have time for minions.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.186
Hey, good move.

05:03.206 --> 05:05.226
You train them up
and then they get power hungry.

05:06.142 --> 05:08.138
It always ends in some sort of coup.

05:12.210 --> 05:15.230
Week one results -
you're at the bottom of every class.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.138
Well, I'm still getting
back into it after the break.

05:20.202 --> 05:23.178
I want to talk to you about putting
hip-hop back on the curriculum.

05:23.194 --> 05:25.150
The Board made its decision.

05:25.170 --> 05:28.198
The Academy trains dancers for ballet
companies, not music videos.

05:28.218 --> 05:31.182
But isn't it important that we learn
all different styles?

05:31.202 --> 05:33.210
What's important
is that these marks improve.

05:33.230 --> 05:37.142
As a scholarship student,
you're expected to be a role model.

05:37.162 --> 05:40.142
I want to see you putting in
extra hours in the studio,

05:40.158 --> 05:41.198
cardio in the gym.

05:41.214 --> 05:45.186
Try harder. Got it.

05:46.190 --> 05:49.186
Mr Kennedy had great faith in you.

05:49.202 --> 05:51.162
Don't let him down.

06:01.186 --> 06:05.226
Excuse me, are you Saskia Duncan?
I hope so.

06:06.146 --> 06:08.198
I saw you in The Firebird.
You were amazing.

06:08.218 --> 06:12.154
Um, I've been carrying the program
around. Do you mind?

06:12.170 --> 06:13.202
Sure.

06:16.186 --> 06:18.206
And you are...
Tara. Tara Webster.

06:23.134 --> 06:25.138
Well, I... I don't want to
disturb your lunch.

06:25.154 --> 06:27.222
No. Join me. I miss Academy gossip.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.166
So, Tara Webster,

06:32.182 --> 06:34.146
are you a good year or a bad year?

06:34.166 --> 06:36.206
Um, I think we're kind of
a mixed bag.

06:36.226 --> 06:40.190
And do you have a boyfriend?
Yes. Yes, I do.

06:40.206 --> 06:42.174
I remember my Academy boyfriend.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.178
Hamish Maddsen.
He was completely gorgeous.

06:45.194 --> 06:46.226
So much trouble, though.

06:47.146 --> 06:50.134
So what happened? Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm asking way too many questions.

06:50.150 --> 06:51.134
No.

06:51.154 --> 06:55.174
Um, the day I got my contract and
he didn't was the end of everything.

06:55.190 --> 06:57.214
We tour so much with the Company,

06:57.234 --> 07:00.133
there's not really enough time
to be dating anyone outside.

07:00.226 --> 07:03.174
So I hope your boy's committed.
To me?

07:03.190 --> 07:06.170
No. To ballet.

07:06.186 --> 07:07.218
Oh.

07:12.158 --> 07:16.154
She's topped everything.
Every single class.

07:16.174 --> 07:19.154
Who?
Grace.

07:19.266 --> 07:21.177
You can't pretend
that doesn't bother you.

07:21.226 --> 07:23.198
Yeah, she's really good.

07:25.202 --> 07:28.222
It's... it's unfair of them to let
someone transfer into second year

07:29.138 --> 07:30.198
and disrupt the whole dynamic.

07:30.214 --> 07:33.170
She doesn't want to be disturbed.

07:33.190 --> 07:37.174
Abigail, we just wanted to say
that you were robbed.

07:40.146 --> 07:41.222
Wait.

07:45.138 --> 07:48.194
You're looking for leadership?
Oh, we've found a leader.

07:48.214 --> 07:52.142
We'll do anything. Sew your
pointe shoes, break them in.

07:54.210 --> 07:58.134
Grace Whitney.
I want to know who she is.

07:58.150 --> 07:59.190
Miss Raine's goddaughter.

07:59.210 --> 08:03.178
Recently transferred from the Royal
Ballet School. Excellent extensions.

08:03.194 --> 08:05.182
Not her Wiki page.

08:05.202 --> 08:10.194
I wanna know how she thinks,
what she wants, any weaknesses.

08:10.214 --> 08:13.226
Know your enemy
and know how to defeat them.

08:14.142 --> 08:15.202
Brilliant.

08:20.154 --> 08:22.150
It's open.

08:24.154 --> 08:27.154
Hi. Grace, isn't it? Cool room.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.206
Oh. We're writing an article for
the monthly Academy newsletter.

08:31.226 --> 08:34.166
We thought a profile on why
you chose to come to the school

08:34.182 --> 08:36.138
would be an excellent addition.

08:36.158 --> 08:38.178
You're friends of Abigail's,
aren't you?

08:38.198 --> 08:41.214
Totally.
Take a seat.

08:52.214 --> 08:54.186
Oh!
Oh!

09:11.194 --> 09:14.170
Amaze-balls!
Oh, show me so I can do it better.

09:22.210 --> 09:24.178
Oh!

09:27.202 --> 09:30.138
I see you listened carefully
to our talk this morning.

09:30.158 --> 09:32.146
Well, you said more cardio, right?
Clear the walkway.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.146
It's a health and safety issue.
How?

09:34.162 --> 09:35.194
Just clear it, Christian.

09:35.214 --> 09:38.182
Well, can we at least
use the studio, like, after-hours?

09:38.202 --> 09:40.174
The studio is to be used
for classical training.

09:40.190 --> 09:42.158
Yeah, but if we have spare time,

09:42.178 --> 09:45.210
why can't we use it working on
an increasingly relevant art form?

09:45.230 --> 09:49.142
I'm relieved to hear you say
you have spare time, Mr Lieberman.

09:49.162 --> 09:51.206
You've been notably absent lately.
Clear it.

09:53.154 --> 09:55.166
I guess we're taking that as a no.

09:55.186 --> 09:58.210
So we meet after-hours.
Right? The studio.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.210
Yep.
Tomorrow. Ten.

10:00.226 --> 10:02.198
If you're there, I'm game.

10:02.218 --> 10:04.214
Yeah, spread the word too, people,
alright?

10:04.230 --> 10:06.206
Let the revolution begin.

10:12.206 --> 10:14.174
You're here!
I like it when you're here.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.190
Hi.
This is for you.

10:18.138 --> 10:19.749
So, how's the friend tally going?

10:19.826 --> 10:22.138
You could have warned me
about the socks.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.186
Socks?

10:23.202 --> 10:25.138
OK, so at normal school,

10:25.158 --> 10:28.134
if you wear them a centimetre
too short, then you're trashy,

10:28.150 --> 10:29.182
but if you wear them too high...

10:29.202 --> 10:31.146
Excommunication.
Yeah.

10:31.166 --> 10:34.146
Sorry, what is this?
A pie chart.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.194
It tracks all of your
out-of-class activities

10:36.210 --> 10:38.142
for maximum time management.

10:38.162 --> 10:39.887
I have one too.
They're colour-coordinated.

10:39.922 --> 10:42.166
You pie-charted my life for me?

10:42.186 --> 10:44.158
Well, if we both
don't get into the Company,

10:44.178 --> 10:47.134
then Saskia says we have
no chance of staying together.

10:49.198 --> 10:52.190
I'm freaking you out, aren't I?

10:52.210 --> 10:56.206
No. Um... it's all
part of your charm, right?

10:58.222 --> 11:01.206
You were right.
The carefree attitude is an act.

11:01.226 --> 11:04.142
She spends hours in the studio
every night.

11:04.162 --> 11:07.146
And she says she left the Royal
because she wasn't the favourite.

11:08.150 --> 11:12.146
Wait. You got this information
directly from her?

11:12.166 --> 11:14.222
She's actually quite open.
And she said to say hi.

11:15.226 --> 11:17.222
This information is compromised.

11:18.142 --> 11:20.166
When I asked you to dig around
Grace's background,

11:20.182 --> 11:21.740
I meant without her knowing.

11:22.142 --> 11:24.142
Haven't you ever stalked anyone?

11:26.190 --> 11:30.218
I want friend requests out to every
student at the Royal Ballet School.

11:33.166 --> 11:37.174
Use a fake profile.
Cover your tracks.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.218
I want the dirt on her family.

11:40.138 --> 11:44.150
Why'd they leave Australia?
Why'd they send her back here?

11:44.170 --> 11:45.177
I need to get into
the school records.

11:45.230 --> 11:48.202
Who knows anything about hacking?
My brother's studying IT.

11:48.218 --> 11:50.150
Use him.

11:50.170 --> 11:52.166
If she's hiding something,
we're gonna find it.

12:02.162 --> 12:06.166
Thanks for inviting me.
This is so exciting.

12:16.210 --> 12:20.154
Um, are you sure it's OK
for me to be here? Yeah!

12:20.174 --> 12:21.524
I always used to sit in
on rehearsals

12:21.530 --> 12:23.062
when I was at the Academy.

12:23.178 --> 12:25.138
It's the best way to learn.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.230
Wow.

12:33.134 --> 12:35.154
You should come tonight as well.
Watch side-stage.

12:35.174 --> 12:38.226
Really? Could I bring someone?
Yeah. Why not?

12:42.158 --> 12:45.230
Lexie! Girls, hi.

12:46.146 --> 12:47.178
Look, I get it.

12:47.198 --> 12:50.138
I haven't done my time,
so you're supposed to ignore me

12:50.154 --> 12:52.178
until I'm completely humiliated

12:52.198 --> 12:55.186
and then one day I'll do something
inexplicably cool

12:55.206 --> 12:58.186
and you'll accept me into your gang,
right?

12:58.202 --> 13:00.134
Uh-huh. Cool.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.190
Well, look,
we've all seen that movie,

13:02.210 --> 13:06.218
so how about I just hang with you
guys until you make up your minds.

13:07.138 --> 13:11.190
Actually, new girl,
we've already made up our minds.

13:16.146 --> 13:17.222
It's the socks, isn't it?

13:31.166 --> 13:33.226
Sorry, is this your spot?
Oh, no, don't worry.

13:34.142 --> 13:35.865
Make the most of it while you can.

13:38.178 --> 13:42.174
You will never guess what.
Uh, they're putting a ban on public
displays of affection?

13:42.194 --> 13:46.166
Better. Saskia has arranged for us
to watch the Company side-stage.

13:46.182 --> 13:48.064
Ooh, you should totally come too.

13:48.138 --> 13:50.202
Again, who is Saskia?

13:50.222 --> 13:53.057
The youngest principal dancer
in the history of the Company.

13:53.150 --> 13:54.222
When are we going?
Tonight.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.194
Oh, no, we can't tonight.

13:56.214 --> 13:58.752
Well, we have to. It's the last
performance of the season.

13:59.134 --> 14:00.839
We've kind of got
this hip-hop thing on.

14:01.138 --> 14:04.028
I hope you're warm because
we're starting in the centre.

14:04.146 --> 14:06.174
What thing?
It's not on the pie chart.

14:06.190 --> 14:07.222
Neither's the ballet.

14:08.142 --> 14:10.162
Mr Reed,
you know I hate to feel repetitive.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.162
What did I say
about focus and discipline?

14:12.182 --> 14:15.214
Saskia's going to introduce us
to some Company people afterwards.

14:16.134 --> 14:18.202
She says it's never too early
to start networking.

14:27.202 --> 14:30.202
It was late notice anyway.
No-one's gonna come.

14:30.218 --> 14:32.230
Yeah, but I cancelled my shift.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.162
Two words, dude -
'thumb' and 'under'.

14:36.182 --> 14:41.146
Well, I'm gonna call it 'compromise'
and 'happy girlfriend'.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.198
Do you wanna meet Saskia?

14:56.218 --> 14:59.202
No, you go. She probably doesn't
want too much distraction.

15:01.642 --> 15:03.176
Didn't you see this already?

15:03.206 --> 15:06.158
Two 'Firebirds', one week.
That's dedication.

15:06.178 --> 15:08.174
Good to know
you're keeping tabs on us.

15:11.146 --> 15:13.158
So Tara's doing a Frankenstein
on you, huh?

15:13.178 --> 15:15.158
I was wondering
if that would happen.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.162
Ballet, black tie event.

15:19.182 --> 15:21.154
Looks like she's creating
the perfect boyfriend.

15:21.174 --> 15:24.214
My personality and your...
everything else.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.138
Working late, Mr Lieberman?

15:48.158 --> 15:51.134
If only your friend
showed as much dedication.

15:54.182 --> 15:56.210
OK. The cloud has passed.

15:56.226 --> 15:58.214
The cloud.

15:58.230 --> 16:01.202
The Raine cloud. It's code, Kat.

16:05.158 --> 16:07.206
Hey!
Whoa.

16:08.214 --> 16:11.206
Where'd you all come from?
And there's more of us outside too.

16:11.226 --> 16:15.158
I'm so glad you're here.
OK. Come on.

16:30.170 --> 16:32.150
I know what happened in London.

16:32.170 --> 16:35.142
You're seriously
sitting in the dark?

16:35.162 --> 16:38.166
And I'm guessing Miss Raine
doesn't know,

16:38.186 --> 16:40.174
otherwise she would never have
let you into the Academy.

16:40.218 --> 16:44.182
Really?
You're a safety hazard, Grace.

16:44.202 --> 16:48.150
So why don't you go upstairs,
flush your creepy little fish,

16:48.170 --> 16:51.198
book a taxi and I'll leave
your reputation intact.

16:51.218 --> 16:55.154
Miss Raine is my godmother
and the principal.

16:55.170 --> 16:57.194
Of course she knows.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.190
So give me the summary.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.182
I got expelled for giving a girl a
nervous breakdown?

17:03.222 --> 17:07.165
Tell who you like.
I don't need to feel popular.

17:07.185 --> 17:10.218
Neither do I.
Hence the minions?

17:11.134 --> 17:14.157
Look, I'm stuck here,

17:14.178 --> 17:16.174
but I don't care about
being the best.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.147
Everyone cares about being the best.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.182
I'm not everyone.

17:21.202 --> 17:24.214
You know,
I thought you were interesting,

17:24.230 --> 17:26.162
but all this?

17:26.178 --> 17:28.134
Not so much.

17:35.158 --> 17:37.178
Two seconds.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.125
I'm guessing no-one showed, right?

17:44.125 --> 17:46.205
No, the opposite. We need bouncers.

17:46.222 --> 17:49.166
Even little first year ballet bods
have shown.

17:49.182 --> 17:52.154
Hip-hop is sweeping the nation!

17:52.170 --> 17:54.138
Yeah, but they need a teacher,

17:54.158 --> 17:56.182
and someone who actually knows
what they're doing.

17:56.198 --> 17:58.214
OK. I'm sure you guys have it sorted.

17:59.134 --> 18:01.663
Mate, you were the instigator,
so you should be here to see it.

18:07.182 --> 18:09.206
Sorry, I have to go.
What? Why?

18:09.226 --> 18:12.202
You don't need me here.
You're not just here for me.

18:12.218 --> 18:14.194
Yeah, I am.

18:14.214 --> 18:17.118
You've got your whole life
mapped out in front of you

18:17.138 --> 18:18.790
and that's great,
but don't overreact,

18:18.790 --> 18:21.710
but I don't even know if I want to
get into the Company or not.

18:21.782 --> 18:23.131
How can you not?

18:23.146 --> 18:25.089
Wait, so you've been lying to me?

18:25.089 --> 18:26.089
You don't wanna be with me
long-term?

18:26.142 --> 18:28.147
No, no. See, that is overreacting.

18:28.178 --> 18:31.146
Whether I want to get into
the Company or not is two years away.

18:31.166 --> 18:34.178
It's something I have to work out.
You're just scared to try.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.142
OK. Why don't you come with me?
Why don't you compromise?

18:38.162 --> 18:40.138
Because this is important.
Exactly.

18:40.158 --> 18:43.214
I wouldn't ask you to give up
something that's important to you.

18:52.178 --> 18:54.138
Hey, are you gonna
teach us something?

18:54.154 --> 18:55.186
Um, OK.

18:55.206 --> 18:58.222
Well... do you guys want to,
like, learn a routine

18:59.138 --> 19:01.158
or... specific moves?

19:19.222 --> 19:21.226
You have to find
your centre of gravity

19:22.142 --> 19:23.174
and then make it your own.

19:25.150 --> 19:26.210
Yeah!

19:34.158 --> 19:37.198
Hip-hop is not only about tricks.

19:37.214 --> 19:39.150
It's about storytelling as well.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.134
So we're gonna start like this.

20:50.226 --> 20:53.134
Drop the curtain!

20:53.150 --> 20:54.226
Ethan, ice, quickly, please.

20:55.146 --> 20:57.138
Call an ambulance and someone
get hold of Doctor Wicks.

20:57.154 --> 20:59.222
I-I...

21:00.142 --> 21:02.158
Give her some room!
Please, step back.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.186
Take some big breaths.
Come on. It'll be alright.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.214
Kat said you'd be here.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.218
Also said you were amazing tonight.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.174
I'm sorry I bailed on you tonight.

21:25.146 --> 21:26.230
What happened?

21:27.146 --> 21:29.166
They took Saskia to hospital.

21:29.182 --> 21:31.134
She fell on stage.

21:32.138 --> 21:34.214
One minute she was dancing
and then the next...

21:35.218 --> 21:37.194
her career is probably over.

21:37.214 --> 21:40.182
Oh, you don't know that.
Exactly.

21:40.202 --> 21:44.202
I don't know what's gonna happen
tomorrow, let alone in two years.

21:44.218 --> 21:46.218
I've been a total control freak.

21:47.222 --> 21:52.218
I have a habit
of throwing good things away.

21:53.134 --> 21:55.214
I just don't want to disappoint you.

21:57.158 --> 21:58.202
That's impossible.

22:01.158 --> 22:03.194
So are you going to show me
what you've been working on?

22:03.214 --> 22:05.210
What, tendues?
No.

22:05.226 --> 22:08.162
I was kind of more thinking hip-hop.

22:08.182 --> 22:11.202
Oh. Well, I don't know
if you're up to it.

22:11.218 --> 22:13.170
Oh, really?

22:22.186 --> 22:25.150
OK, wait. Do that again.
Do that again. I can't do that.

22:32.174 --> 22:33.230
We were up all night.

22:34.150 --> 22:36.222
Why are you dressed like me?
We thought it could be our thing.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.214
We have no 'thing'.

22:44.194 --> 22:47.222
Look, you're first years.

22:48.142 --> 22:50.066
You're gonna have to find
your own way.

22:50.134 --> 22:51.210
I can't do it for you.

22:58.222 --> 23:00.182
Dreams are complicated.

23:00.202 --> 23:04.138
I forget they're only one-third
of the happiness puzzle.

23:06.218 --> 23:10.166
Is it always like this?
Some days, it's infantile.

23:10.186 --> 23:13.214
Sometimes I'm running
after my dreams so fast,

23:13.523 --> 23:17.143
I miss the detours that lead me
to places new and unexpected.

23:21.174 --> 23:23.150
That doesn't mean
I'm going to stop dreaming.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.166
Without them, I'd be lost.

23:33.174 --> 23:35.142
Because there's nothing more magical

23:35.162 --> 23:38.017
than when you catch one
and get to hold it in your hands...

23:39.178 --> 23:41.154
for one perfect moment.
