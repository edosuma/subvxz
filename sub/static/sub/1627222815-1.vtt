00:03.272 --> 00:06.189
(thunder rumbling)

00:10.192 --> 00:15.192
(rain spattering)
(thunder rumbling)

00:22.609 --> 00:23.778
- Set, hike.

00:23.778 --> 00:24.649
Go long.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.482
(dramatic music)

00:28.703 --> 00:30.387
- You almost had that.

00:30.387 --> 00:33.137
(dramatic music)

00:35.244 --> 00:36.317
- Good try, good try!

00:36.317 --> 00:37.606
- Same play?

00:37.606 --> 00:38.851
- Let's do it.

00:38.851 --> 00:39.860
(dramatic music)

00:39.860 --> 00:40.693
Set, hike.

00:40.693 --> 00:43.435
(dramatic music)

00:43.435 --> 00:44.661
- That's mine, that's mine!

00:44.661 --> 00:45.828
- No it's not!

00:47.279 --> 00:48.830
- Yeah, first down!

00:48.830 --> 00:53.830
(dramatic music)
(people chattering)

00:55.024 --> 01:00.024
(dramatic music)
(wind whistling)

01:02.350 --> 01:03.183
- Hey!

01:07.405 --> 01:10.189
(gun fires)

01:10.189 --> 01:12.439
- [Michael] Yeah, interception.

01:16.590 --> 01:17.690
- [Davis] Hey, back off!

01:18.900 --> 01:20.800
- Hey, I'm just trying to help.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.997
(wind whistling)

01:22.997 --> 01:25.580
(phone buzzes)

01:26.770 --> 01:27.603
Hey, I gotta go.

01:27.603 --> 01:30.058
Do you guys need me to call
a paramedic or anything?

01:30.058 --> 01:31.860
- I think we'll be fine,
thanks for the help.

01:31.860 --> 01:32.774
- I'm Daniel.

01:32.774 --> 01:33.607
- Michael.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.200
- [Davis] Jacob, you okay?

01:37.190 --> 01:38.160
Jacob?

01:38.160 --> 01:39.360
- What happened?

01:39.360 --> 01:41.777
- [Michael] Pretty sure
you got hit by lightning.

01:43.016 --> 01:44.391
- [Davis] Do you feel all right?

01:44.391 --> 01:45.256
- [Jacob] Yeah,

01:45.256 --> 01:48.339
I feel strange, but I think I'm okay.

01:49.332 --> 01:52.082
(wind whistling)

01:59.585 --> 02:00.970
- This wasn't my fault, was it?

02:00.970 --> 02:02.020
- Your fault for what?

02:02.020 --> 02:04.320
- [Michael] Jacob getting
struck by lightning.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.760
- I don't think this is anybody's fault,

02:07.760 --> 02:10.110
but mother nature's if
we're pointing fingers.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.360
- It just doesn't feel right.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.460
Plus, you invited him.

02:16.462 --> 02:17.497
- Yeah, but he came.

02:17.497 --> 02:21.040
(wind whistling)

02:21.040 --> 02:23.247
- Take him back to the house.

02:23.247 --> 02:25.997
(wind whistling)

02:29.660 --> 02:30.770
- Are you sure it will
be okay with the storm?

02:30.770 --> 02:31.603
Okay with the storm,

02:31.603 --> 02:34.151
okay with the storm, okay with the storm?

02:34.151 --> 02:36.901
(dramatic music)

02:38.031 --> 02:40.781
(dramatic music)

02:50.230 --> 02:53.293
- Hey, Jacob, do you
want something to eat?

02:58.052 --> 02:59.770
Well, at least he's asleep.

02:59.770 --> 03:02.603
(dramatic music)

03:31.215 --> 03:32.125
- Got the medicine.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.277
- Nice.

03:33.277 --> 03:36.500
Are there instructions on the bottle?

03:36.500 --> 03:38.240
- To be taken three times per day,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.730
every seven to nine hours with food.

03:40.730 --> 03:43.020
Failure to follow these
instructions could result

03:43.020 --> 03:45.660
in severe brain damage and possible death.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.600
- Well, we should probably find Jacob

03:47.600 --> 03:49.570
and get him the medicine.

03:49.570 --> 03:50.403
- All right.

03:50.403 --> 03:53.197
(dramatic music)

03:59.500 --> 04:00.450
Michael, where's Jacob?

04:00.450 --> 04:01.560
- What do you mean?

04:01.560 --> 04:02.910
He's right in front of you?

04:04.673 --> 04:06.450
- This is nothing but a ton of pillows!

04:06.450 --> 04:07.663
I thought you were watching him.

04:07.663 --> 04:10.390
- I was, I went to the
kitchen to get a snack

04:10.390 --> 04:11.820
and he was asleep here.

04:11.820 --> 04:14.020
- You're so dumb, you really think--

04:14.020 --> 04:16.080
- Well, we have to find him.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.670
Okay, while you're sitting here,

04:17.670 --> 04:19.660
blaming me for everything

04:19.660 --> 04:23.269
Jacob's wandering around and
who knows where he could be.

04:23.269 --> 04:24.930
- I do.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.180
But who is he talking to?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.880
- You know, you should
meet my other friends.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.200
I think you'd really liked them.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.940
- [Ava] Sure, I'd love to.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.060
- Davis and Michael are their names.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.830
I just don't know where they are though.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.680
- I'm sure they'll turn up somewhere.

04:40.170 --> 04:41.794
- Hey Jacob, we're right here.

04:41.794 --> 04:44.340
- Who are you talking to?

04:44.340 --> 04:45.173
Jacob?

04:46.070 --> 04:48.133
- Can he hear us, is he deaf or something?

04:48.133 --> 04:49.143
- I don't know.

04:51.080 --> 04:51.913
Who's he talking to,

04:51.913 --> 04:54.117
did we miss the medicine
deadlines or something?

04:54.117 --> 04:55.513
- [Davis] Oh shoot, did we?

04:56.836 --> 04:58.140
- I don't know.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.440
It's like he's in some
kind of second reality.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.493
What do we do?

05:05.480 --> 05:06.690
- I think we can grab him

05:06.690 --> 05:09.660
if he becomes a danger to
anybody, including himself.

05:09.660 --> 05:11.710
We'll just watch and observe for now.

05:11.710 --> 05:12.543
- Sounds good.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.370
- That's so weird they
haven't turned up yet.

05:22.370 --> 05:23.699
- That's okay.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.549
It's no big deal.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.283
- Hey Jacob, wait up.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.170
You really shouldn't be walking
around all over the place.

05:33.170 --> 05:34.193
- Where is he going?

05:35.610 --> 05:37.090
- I don't know, that's dangerous

05:37.090 --> 05:40.496
for him to be wandering
around, especially out here.

05:40.496 --> 05:42.746
- Who the hell does he
think he's talking to?

05:44.036 --> 05:45.600
- They, well, Davis and Michael think

05:45.600 --> 05:47.177
I'm more injured than I actually am.

05:47.177 --> 05:48.940
I'm mean, surely I got
struck by lightning,

05:48.940 --> 05:51.143
but I feel perfectly fine.

05:52.470 --> 05:54.310
They can just make a big
deal out of small things,

05:54.310 --> 05:55.173
I guess I dunno.

05:56.430 --> 05:58.590
- They obviously care about you though.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.656
- Yeah, but they won't let it go.

06:00.656 --> 06:02.705
They probably think I'm crazy.

06:02.705 --> 06:03.600
Do you think that?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.400
- No, you're a great person, Jacob.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.550
- Jacob, we're right here.

06:09.550 --> 06:11.653
- Jacob turn around we are right here.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.970
- What's going on, are you okay?

06:15.970 --> 06:17.590
- I don't know, I think so.

06:17.590 --> 06:19.440
I think I just tripped on something.

06:20.950 --> 06:22.853
- Jacob, just stop already.

06:22.853 --> 06:24.910
I don't know what kind of
game you're playing here,

06:24.910 --> 06:25.837
but I'm starting to think

06:25.837 --> 06:27.425
that you're possessed or something.

06:27.425 --> 06:28.940
- [Davis] I should have brought a taser.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.480
That would have snapped
him out of it real quickly.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.010
- That would be kinda funny, but you know,

06:33.010 --> 06:33.850
he's already injured,

06:33.850 --> 06:37.121
I think he's already had
enough voltage for one day.

06:37.121 --> 06:38.260
- I think I'm starting to believe

06:38.260 --> 06:40.813
Davis and Michael, maybe I am crazy.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.520
- You're awesome Jacob.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.773
Anything but crazy.

06:46.350 --> 06:49.053
- Okay, so we need to get
Jacob to take his medicine.

06:52.190 --> 06:54.963
Question is, how do we get him to take it?

06:57.020 --> 06:57.870
- I have an idea.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.393
- Jacob, do you want some soup?

07:07.600 --> 07:08.603
Jacob?

07:10.120 --> 07:12.403
Yes, no, you want soup?

07:12.403 --> 07:15.153
(dramatic music)

07:32.690 --> 07:33.523
- You ready for dinner?

07:33.523 --> 07:34.990
- Yeah, what'd you make?

07:34.990 --> 07:35.914
- I haven't started yet.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.581
(both chuckles)

07:41.400 --> 07:42.518
What?

07:42.518 --> 07:45.268
(dramatic music)

07:56.210 --> 07:57.423
- Davis, come here!

07:58.260 --> 07:59.750
- [Davis] Yeah, what's up?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.874
- Look, he's reading the note I wrote him.

08:01.874 --> 08:02.890
You know what this means?

08:02.890 --> 08:05.177
- Your guys' relationship's
getting intense?

08:05.177 --> 08:06.260
- Oh God, no.

08:07.210 --> 08:08.600
- I'm just messing.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.410
- It means we can communicate with him.

08:11.410 --> 08:12.970
- Oh, that's awesome.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.090
What should we say?

08:14.090 --> 08:16.320
Well, what did you say on that note?

08:16.320 --> 08:20.217
- I said, "Dear Jacob, look,
I made you your favorite food

08:20.217 --> 08:23.880
in the whole entire world,
chicken noodle soup.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.003
Please come to reality while you're at it.

08:27.060 --> 08:29.373
Sincerely Davis and Michael."

08:30.858 --> 08:32.310
- What does it say?

08:32.310 --> 08:34.333
- Michael made soup for me.

08:35.538 --> 08:36.453
- Was that it?

08:36.453 --> 08:39.403
- He said he wants me
to come back to reality.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.670
- Maybe he's just messing around.

08:42.670 --> 08:44.460
- I don't think so, I mean,

08:44.460 --> 08:47.000
he wrote this note, he made soup.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.720
How could I have missed him?

08:48.720 --> 08:50.840
I mean, he's been in front
of me this entire time

08:50.840 --> 08:52.540
and yet I haven't seen him at all.

08:53.644 --> 08:54.770
- But you're happy, aren't you?

08:54.770 --> 08:55.820
I mean I'm happy.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.283
- No, I'm not.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.727
I just want to see my friends.

09:00.630 --> 09:04.270
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize
they meant that much to you.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.323
- They're all I have.

09:07.970 --> 09:09.930
- I'm not sure what his friend was saying,

09:09.930 --> 09:11.600
but it sounds like he really
needs us right now Michael.

09:11.600 --> 09:15.690
- He needs to eat his food,
it has his medicine in it.

09:15.690 --> 09:16.670
- I still think it's important

09:16.670 --> 09:18.100
for him to receive notes from us.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.940
He needs to know what's going on.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.760
- What did the doctor tell us?

09:21.760 --> 09:24.070
He said take the medicine

09:24.070 --> 09:27.353
every seven to nine hours with food.

09:28.220 --> 09:30.820
- I'm done with you, Michael
you're so dang selfish.

09:32.510 --> 09:34.178
- You're selfish.

09:34.178 --> 09:36.928
(dramatic music)

09:43.533 --> 09:45.690
- Tomorrow I bet my friends will show up.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.040
Probably just need to rest.

09:48.990 --> 09:50.403
There's this really cool park I found

09:50.403 --> 09:52.910
that I could take you there like tomorrow.

09:52.910 --> 09:55.270
- Well, if it makes you
happy then of course.

09:55.270 --> 09:58.960
- Thanks Ava, I just
felt so lonely recently.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.923
I feel like I haven't seen
another person in a while.

10:03.890 --> 10:06.993
- Thank you, Jacob, I'll see you tomorrow.

10:06.993 --> 10:09.493
(Jacob yells)

10:11.414 --> 10:13.831
- You were right, I'm insane.

10:14.754 --> 10:17.337
(morose music)

10:25.250 --> 10:29.534
"Jacob, you are not
mentally stable right now.

10:29.534 --> 10:33.410
You keep talking to this person,
Ava, I believe is her name.

10:33.410 --> 10:37.750
She isn't real, she's a
figment of your imagination.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.127
Also, we can't see her,

10:39.127 --> 10:42.260
and I don't believe you can see us either.

10:42.260 --> 10:46.320
We've medicine to give you,
there was some in your dinner.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.060
You need to take it every
seven to nine hours, with food.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.810
I'm sorry there was no easier way

10:51.810 --> 10:53.200
or any other way in that matter

10:53.200 --> 10:56.648
to address this to you,
Davis and Michael."

10:56.648 --> 10:59.231
(morose music)

11:11.660 --> 11:13.480
- Why does it have to be like this?

11:13.480 --> 11:15.033
I can't make a decision.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.401
- Jacob are you all right?

11:18.401 --> 11:19.909
- Go away.

11:19.909 --> 11:20.742
- Why?

11:20.742 --> 11:22.123
- I said go away.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.023
- Jacob, please talk to me.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.320
- You're not real.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.683
I feel like I'm the only
person left on this Earth.

11:33.137 --> 11:33.970
- You have your friends.

11:33.970 --> 11:36.063
- They're not here to help me.

11:38.750 --> 11:42.023
You shattered my
happiness, my will to live.

11:43.306 --> 11:46.720
- You know, all I want
is for you to be happy.

11:46.720 --> 11:51.692
- If you want me to be
happy, then please, go away.

11:51.692 --> 11:54.442
(dramatic music)

12:39.067 --> 12:40.852
- Michael, come here.

12:40.852 --> 12:43.569
(dramatic music)

12:43.569 --> 12:45.263
- Holy crap, is he gonna take it?

12:46.240 --> 12:47.993
- Hopefully, let's go.

12:50.001 --> 12:52.918
(pills clattering)

13:06.560 --> 13:07.393
- Damn.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.140
Someday people will understand me.

13:11.140 --> 13:13.664
For now I'm just gonna stay away.

13:13.664 --> 13:15.247
God, I hate people.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.273
Damn it!

13:24.998 --> 13:27.998
(suspenseful music)

13:58.844 --> 14:00.910
- Do you hear that?

14:00.910 --> 14:02.940
- Wait a second, is that a person?

14:02.940 --> 14:04.729
- It sounds like it

14:04.729 --> 14:07.729
(suspenseful music)

14:17.635 --> 14:18.670
Is that blood?

14:18.670 --> 14:20.718
- [Man] Yeah, someone was bleeding.

14:20.718 --> 14:21.551
- [Man] Let's follow it
and see where it goes.

14:21.551 --> 14:22.500
- [Man] There's a trail.

14:24.488 --> 14:27.488
(suspenseful music)

14:47.540 --> 14:51.837
- Whoever that was, they have
to be around here somewhere.

14:51.837 --> 14:54.837
(suspenseful music)

15:09.096 --> 15:11.346
- Fix this, I can fix this.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.863
- Jacob, you okay?

15:24.770 --> 15:26.233
Just seeing how you're doing.

15:29.330 --> 15:30.913
All right then, get some sleep.

15:39.010 --> 15:41.723
Jacob, what can I say?

15:43.465 --> 15:44.623
- [Michael] What did he do this time?

15:46.420 --> 15:47.880
- I heard him scream so I went in there

15:47.880 --> 15:50.533
to check on him and he gave
me nothing but a blank face.

15:52.770 --> 15:56.853
- He'll be fine, we just need
him to talk again, you know.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.010
- [Davis] Oh Jacob.

16:02.710 --> 16:04.210
Your medicine is on the counter.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.793
- [Michael] And take that with food.

16:11.664 --> 16:14.414
(pills rattling)

16:15.870 --> 16:17.440
- It'll pass, huh?

16:17.440 --> 16:18.523
- Give him time.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.963
- You think it was a bad
idea leaving Jacob at home?

16:22.800 --> 16:24.500
- I don't think so.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.350
It's not like he enjoys being
around other people anyway.

16:31.010 --> 16:33.310
Like the thing is we've
done everything we can

16:33.310 --> 16:34.630
to try to get Jacob back

16:34.630 --> 16:37.360
in good health and nothing's working.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.970
- I don't care, but I do care about Jacob

16:39.970 --> 16:44.510
and it's not necessarily Jacob,
but the people around him.

16:44.510 --> 16:47.323
I mean, for all we know he
could pose a serious threat.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.350
- What, a threat?

16:50.350 --> 16:51.690
Anything but.

16:51.690 --> 16:53.740
Jeez, some friends they are.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.190
- Then it's best that we keep
them away from other people.

16:56.190 --> 16:59.540
That could have serious consequences.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.263
- Screw this, I've heard enough.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.170
- Do you think Jacob remembers cutting

17:05.170 --> 17:06.383
his leg a few days ago?

17:07.410 --> 17:09.660
He was asleep the entire
time at the hospital.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.673
And when he woke up, he wasn't the same.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.110
- We can't tell for sure,

17:14.110 --> 17:16.610
but I do remember that one dream he had,

17:16.610 --> 17:19.470
you know, the night we got
home from the hospital.

17:19.470 --> 17:20.730
- I wonder if he's better,

17:20.730 --> 17:21.563
but don't you think we should

17:21.563 --> 17:23.480
stop treating him like a child?

17:23.480 --> 17:26.800
- Yeah, but he's also
still dangerous, right?

17:26.800 --> 17:27.780
- But how do we know if we treat him

17:27.780 --> 17:28.720
like a child all the time?

17:28.720 --> 17:31.680
- You know what, you can
do whatever you want, okay.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.120
But it's just not my fault

17:33.120 --> 17:35.860
when he murders somebody or something.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.040
- How am I supposed to get better

17:37.040 --> 17:39.140
if all those guys want to do is detain me?

17:40.020 --> 17:41.353
I need some time alone.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.617
Screw this, I'm outta here.

17:45.617 --> 17:48.367
(dramatic music)

17:54.870 --> 17:56.563
- [Michael] Is dinner about ready yet?

17:58.190 --> 17:59.023
- [Davis] Yeah.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.120
Where's Jacob?

18:01.120 --> 18:02.660
- Oh, he's asleep I think.

18:02.660 --> 18:03.550
- Good, good.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.840
I really do think he's getting better.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.320
- You know what, you said
that about a million times.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.980
Jacob is not better, okay?

18:10.980 --> 18:12.340
That's a fact.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.480
- You're just mad because
you're going to lose the bet.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.610
- You know what, it's pretty clear

18:15.610 --> 18:18.087
that you're just trying to be
way too optimistic about this

18:18.087 --> 18:20.020
and we need to face the reality,

18:20.020 --> 18:21.910
which is that he's not better.

18:21.910 --> 18:23.180
- You know what Michael?

18:23.180 --> 18:24.510
Go get dinner somewhere else.

18:24.510 --> 18:25.710
Just get out of here.

18:25.710 --> 18:28.730
- Fine, I'm taking Jacob with me.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.871
- Jacob is staying here.

18:30.871 --> 18:31.754
- Whatever!

18:31.754 --> 18:34.504
(dramatic music)

18:38.677 --> 18:41.046
"Go get dinner by yourself," idiot.

18:41.046 --> 18:43.796
(dramatic music)

18:50.157 --> 18:51.570
- I'm so done with him.

18:51.570 --> 18:53.463
I mean, you know, he can stay out.

18:54.860 --> 18:57.140
Jacob, dinner's ready.

18:57.140 --> 19:00.743
- Hi, can I have the number
three combo meal without cheese?

19:02.750 --> 19:06.343
- Jacob, come and eat, now.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.073
Jacob?

19:22.720 --> 19:23.553
Jacob?

19:27.830 --> 19:28.929
Jacob.

19:28.929 --> 19:31.679
(dramatic music)

19:40.103 --> 19:42.770
(phone buzzing)

19:45.150 --> 19:45.983
Dang it!

19:47.208 --> 19:52.208
Oh Michael.

19:53.410 --> 19:54.243
- Nope.

19:55.091 --> 19:56.258
Done with him.

20:01.943 --> 20:04.587
- Come on Michael, pick up the phone.

20:07.396 --> 20:09.863
- Jesus, what does he want now?

20:09.863 --> 20:10.890
I'm done.

20:10.890 --> 20:13.640
(dramatic music)

20:35.576 --> 20:37.651
I knew it, he's such an idiot.

20:37.651 --> 20:40.651
(suspenseful music)

20:52.774 --> 20:53.607
Have you seen Jacob?

20:53.607 --> 20:55.063
- No, I haven't seen him anywhere.

20:57.649 --> 20:58.570
- I'm so sorry dude.

20:58.570 --> 21:01.050
- Now really isn't the
time for this, Michael.

21:01.050 --> 21:03.003
We need to focus on Jacob.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.220
- Jacob, how do we find Jacob?

21:08.220 --> 21:10.180
- Did you see his car in the driveway?

21:10.180 --> 21:12.870
- No, wasn't in the driveway.

21:12.870 --> 21:13.988
Let's go look for his car.

21:13.988 --> 21:16.738
(dramatic music)

21:20.670 --> 21:22.520
- [Davis] Michael, get over here now.

21:27.608 --> 21:29.941
I don't think he's sleeping.

21:30.801 --> 21:32.634
- [Michael] He's gone.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.400
- All right guys, any minute now.

21:49.210 --> 21:51.883
How did we not think of this sooner?

21:53.743 --> 21:55.160
- There they are.

22:01.031 --> 22:04.050
Stale as hell, but so good.

22:04.050 --> 22:06.610
- Guys, have you put any thought

22:06.610 --> 22:09.330
into the fact that it's only us?

22:09.330 --> 22:14.010
I mean, duh, but if
you think about it, us.

22:14.010 --> 22:16.283
Just us on this whole planet.

22:17.350 --> 22:18.373
What should we do?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.033
- Let's go.

22:36.340 --> 22:38.440
- [Jacob] Guys, what's going on?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.010
- [Michael] You said it
yourself, it's only us,

22:41.010 --> 22:43.820
there's no hope for humanity.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.740
We're definitely going to get lonely.

22:45.740 --> 22:46.960
Hell we already are.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.020
I mean, we can't do this forever.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.430
- [Davis] Or can we?

22:50.430 --> 22:51.263
- [Michael] How the hell do you

22:51.263 --> 22:53.290
suppose we're going to do that?

22:53.290 --> 22:55.510
- [Davis] Let's do
something that we can enjoy.

22:55.510 --> 22:57.450
Let's not focused on the downside.

22:57.450 --> 23:00.240
Let's give our lives a purpose.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.340
- [Jacob] I honestly don't know
how we're going to do that.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.130
- [Davis] Trust me, my gut tells me that

23:06.130 --> 23:08.740
something is going to
happen to change our lives.

23:08.740 --> 23:09.573
- [Michael] I am skeptical.

23:09.573 --> 23:11.180
- [Jacob] Yeah, same here.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.350
- [Michael] I think it's just difficult

23:12.350 --> 23:13.370
to find hope when you're the

23:13.370 --> 23:15.530
only freaking person left on the planet.

23:15.530 --> 23:17.920
- [Davis] And I completely
understand what you're saying,

23:17.920 --> 23:19.420
but we will get through this.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.170
- [Michael] Holy shit, what's that?

23:29.060 --> 23:30.630
- Guys, have you see what's going on?

23:30.630 --> 23:32.804
- [Jacob] Let me guess,
it's the end of the world.

23:32.804 --> 23:33.887
- [Michael] Yeah.

23:33.887 --> 23:35.263
- So you've seen the news then?

23:35.263 --> 23:36.540
- Oh yeah, what is it this time?

23:36.540 --> 23:40.973
Volcanoes, aliens, nuclear warfare?

23:42.370 --> 23:45.593
- Just death, a disease.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.593
- So you're serious?

23:51.950 --> 23:54.490
- The death count is
already at 22 million.

23:54.490 --> 23:55.903
What are we going to do?

23:58.667 --> 24:00.834
- [Jacob] We're gonna die.

24:02.230 --> 24:04.890
- We'll get through this somehow, right?

24:04.890 --> 24:07.420
- [Michael] I don't like those numbers.

24:07.420 --> 24:08.993
- Well, I have an idea.

24:09.930 --> 24:12.200
What if we just didn't go outside?

24:12.200 --> 24:16.080
I mean, if it's not a virus
it's not contagious, right?

24:16.080 --> 24:18.090
So if we seal off all the perimeters

24:18.090 --> 24:21.000
and then take inventory
of our food and supplies,

24:21.000 --> 24:22.103
we might be okay.

24:23.350 --> 24:24.830
- Sounds legit.

24:24.830 --> 24:28.920
But the only thing is, they
said just about any vaccination

24:28.920 --> 24:32.603
within the last three
months, I mean it says--

24:32.603 --> 24:34.030
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, news.

24:34.030 --> 24:36.000
- We have breaking news today

24:36.000 --> 24:39.210
as we look at the terror
spreading across the planet.

24:39.210 --> 24:41.870
Millions dead, billions infected,

24:41.870 --> 24:43.810
we have recently been corrected

24:43.810 --> 24:46.290
on the spreading of this mass terror.

24:46.290 --> 24:48.250
We go to Helen live at

24:48.250 --> 24:52.023
the Colorado Springs
International Research Center.

24:53.620 --> 24:54.580
- Good afternoon, Peter.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.040
We are live in front of

24:56.040 --> 24:59.050
the Colorado Springs
International Research Center

24:59.050 --> 25:00.380
where we are being informed on what

25:00.380 --> 25:02.510
causes the spread of this disease.

25:02.510 --> 25:04.140
I'm here with research specialist

25:04.140 --> 25:07.160
Andy Green to talk to us about it. Andy?

25:07.160 --> 25:09.560
- Hi Helen, thanks for
having me this afternoon.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.790
So we just found out that,

25:12.790 --> 25:14.190
although we originally thought

25:14.190 --> 25:17.460
that the disease spread through vaccines,

25:17.460 --> 25:19.750
turns out that's just one way

25:19.750 --> 25:21.330
for you to get the disease inside of you.

25:21.330 --> 25:24.140
And yes, I did say inside of you,

25:24.140 --> 25:25.160
what we have found out is that

25:25.160 --> 25:27.180
it is spread through blood exposure.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.800
The disease is in the air

25:28.800 --> 25:29.980
and as it travels around

25:29.980 --> 25:32.670
and you get a cut and your
blood, it gets exposed.

25:32.670 --> 25:33.503
It's inside of you.

25:33.503 --> 25:35.910
- So what you're saying is something,

25:35.910 --> 25:37.580
even as small as a paper cut,

25:37.580 --> 25:39.450
can give you this deadly disease?

25:39.450 --> 25:41.010
- Helen, what I'm saying is

25:41.010 --> 25:42.980
that even over the past three months,

25:42.980 --> 25:47.130
if you've had any exposure
to the air with your blood,

25:47.130 --> 25:49.890
there's a hundred percent
chance that you have this.

25:49.890 --> 25:52.040
There is no way that people out there

25:52.040 --> 25:53.513
do not have this disease.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.423
- Thank you, Andy, back to you, Peter.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.200
- Bone chilling information.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.770
Remember to stay clear
of any sharp objects

26:01.770 --> 26:04.670
or any objects that could expose blood.

26:04.670 --> 26:06.420
- I need someone that cares for me.

26:07.613 --> 26:09.263
That person doesn't exist though.

26:10.130 --> 26:11.743
Why is this who I am?

26:13.561 --> 26:15.208
God, I can't do this.

26:15.208 --> 26:17.958
(dramatic music)

26:23.570 --> 26:25.353
- Davis, he's awake.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.033
- Jacob, why'd you hurt yourself?

26:30.210 --> 26:31.950
Jacob, I'm sure you're going to be fine.

26:31.950 --> 26:34.913
- What part of the last three
months to not understand?

26:35.950 --> 26:37.650
- Actually he didn't hurt himself.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.923
- Well, then how did he end up like this?

26:42.970 --> 26:46.220
- I think he just burst
open on one of his stitches.

26:46.220 --> 26:47.563
Maybe just passed out.

26:49.501 --> 26:50.334
- [Davis] Oh Jacob.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.853
- He has the disease Davis.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.410
He's going to die.

27:07.410 --> 27:09.690
- And what are we going to do about it?

27:09.690 --> 27:11.283
- There's nothing we can do.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.290
It's over.

27:14.290 --> 27:16.490
- We have to do something for him,

27:16.490 --> 27:18.670
and we're not out of the blue either.

27:18.670 --> 27:19.973
Any blood exposure?

27:22.280 --> 27:24.380
There's no way we don't have this disease.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.453
- Yeah, you're right.

27:31.921 --> 27:33.171
I'm gonna go talk to him.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.700
Jacob, we're all going to be all right.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.970
We all have this disease.

27:49.970 --> 27:52.870
Billions have it, you aren't
any different from us.

27:52.870 --> 27:55.809
Let's just live with what we have.

27:55.809 --> 27:58.559
(dramatic music)

28:00.387 --> 28:03.475
- You're right, let's do it.

28:03.475 --> 28:06.225
(dramatic music)

28:50.910 --> 28:52.470
- Good afternoon, everyone.

28:52.470 --> 28:54.470
We come at you with some exciting

28:54.470 --> 28:57.170
yet tragic news on this May 7th.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.520
Scientists believe to have found a cure

28:59.520 --> 29:01.490
and will end this disease that has now

29:01.490 --> 29:04.480
killed over 200 million people.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.150
We go to Helen live

29:06.150 --> 29:07.580
at the Colorado Springs

29:07.580 --> 29:09.973
International Research Center. Helen?

29:11.130 --> 29:12.070
- Good afternoon, Peter.

29:12.070 --> 29:13.960
We do have very exciting news.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.690
In less than 24 hours we will find out

29:16.690 --> 29:19.090
if the supposed cure that has been made

29:19.090 --> 29:21.300
for this disease will be effective.

29:21.300 --> 29:24.600
Hospitals nationwide have
already placed pre-orders

29:24.600 --> 29:27.840
on what could be an effective vaccination.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.030
We'll have more news for you in 24 hours

29:30.030 --> 29:32.483
on whether or not it
worked, back to you, Peter.

29:33.350 --> 29:35.410
- Thanks for the update, Helen.

29:35.410 --> 29:36.580
After the break--

29:36.580 --> 29:37.690
- So a cure, huh?

29:37.690 --> 29:39.003
- [Jacob] That's exciting.

29:40.270 --> 29:41.930
- They say that if you don't show

29:41.930 --> 29:44.930
any signs of near death and a cure works,

29:44.930 --> 29:46.610
then you're most likely going to live.

29:46.610 --> 29:47.910
- Well, that's great news.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.968
(dramatic music)

30:18.920 --> 30:23.070
- Jacob, Davis, you're going
to want to come see this!

30:23.070 --> 30:24.480
- Good morning, everyone.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.870
I'm Peter filling in for Cameron.

30:26.870 --> 30:28.470
We have breaking news.

30:28.470 --> 30:30.970
As it has been discovered that the cure

30:30.970 --> 30:33.310
has been stolen and replaced.

30:33.310 --> 30:35.210
As soon as scientists noticed

30:35.210 --> 30:37.440
a difference in the coloration,

30:37.440 --> 30:40.250
they knew immediately
that it wasn't a match.

30:40.250 --> 30:44.040
The real question is who
would do something like this?

30:44.040 --> 30:46.210
- Damn it, why, who does that?

30:46.210 --> 30:48.460
I'm going to find out who
that is and murder them.

30:48.460 --> 30:50.010
This isn't even funny.

30:50.010 --> 30:51.250
And turn the TV off.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.370
- Jacob, calm down.

30:52.370 --> 30:53.633
- I said, turn it off.

30:55.230 --> 30:56.660
- Why aren't you pissed?

30:56.660 --> 30:58.280
You have this disease to.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.810
- Look at Michael, he's fine.

30:59.810 --> 31:04.130
- Bullshit, I'm not fine,
okay now we're all gonna die.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.000
It's the scientists' fault.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.890
They don't even have a
copy of this supposed cure.

31:08.890 --> 31:10.503
- I want to know who did this.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.410
- Let's go out there and find them.

31:13.410 --> 31:15.750
- Guys, that's a terrible idea.

31:15.750 --> 31:16.900
I don't want you two dying

31:16.900 --> 31:18.300
because you were dumb enough to do this.

31:18.300 --> 31:19.533
Now get back here.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.930
- This is ridiculous.

31:22.930 --> 31:25.200
So we live another week at best.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.370
- [Davis] You're such a pessimist.

31:26.370 --> 31:27.870
- Better than an optimist.

31:27.870 --> 31:30.820
- [Davis] BS being an optimist
at times like this is great.

31:30.820 --> 31:33.070
- Yeah, says the one who left me alone

31:33.070 --> 31:34.730
because he thought I would get better

31:34.730 --> 31:36.423
and then I almost killed myself.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.163
- Wow, Jacob, that's a
way to kill the mood.

31:42.570 --> 31:44.020
- We all know it's his fault.

31:45.530 --> 31:47.530
- [Davis] Hey, why don't we go downtown

31:47.530 --> 31:48.910
and get something to eat?

31:48.910 --> 31:51.340
You know, just to get out of the house.

31:51.340 --> 31:53.320
- [Michael] Oh, that's a great idea.

31:53.320 --> 31:56.723
It's not like there's a
pandemic going on or anything.

31:58.020 --> 31:59.830
- Screw it, we'll be fine.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.430
- [Davis] Sounds good, set's go.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.563
So, you good?

32:12.580 --> 32:13.530
- What do you mean?

32:14.450 --> 32:16.775
- [Davis] Well, I mean,
was this a good idea?

32:16.775 --> 32:18.229
- I guess.

32:18.229 --> 32:20.979
(engine rumbles)

32:27.020 --> 32:28.410
- We're here.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.300
- [Michael] Thanks Captain Obvious.

32:30.300 --> 32:31.610
- Just trying to like the mood.

32:31.610 --> 32:33.050
- Why do we need to lighten the mood?

32:33.050 --> 32:34.110
The mood's fine.

32:34.110 --> 32:35.790
- Cause there's a deadly
disease going around,

32:35.790 --> 32:37.490
and anybody can get it.

32:37.490 --> 32:40.676
All you need is a freaking
paper cut or something.

32:40.676 --> 32:42.363
- [Jacob] Would you just shut up about it?

32:46.940 --> 32:48.570
- Well, I mean, if you're
going to avoid just

32:48.570 --> 32:50.987
getting a paper cut,
then you're good, right?

32:50.987 --> 32:54.230
- Well what about biting your
lip or getting a bloody nose?

32:54.230 --> 32:56.180
You're telling me you've
avoided all these things

32:56.180 --> 32:57.520
for the past three months?

32:57.520 --> 32:59.700
- Stop talking about it.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.410
We came here to escape and now
you're bringing it with us.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.230
- Exactly, Michael said he came down here

33:04.230 --> 33:05.560
to get away from the drama,

33:05.560 --> 33:07.210
so that's what we're going to do.

33:11.010 --> 33:11.843
- How many?

33:13.560 --> 33:14.393
- Three.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.660
- Okay, it'll be a few minutes.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.570
We're a little short-staffed.

33:18.570 --> 33:19.453
- Okay, thanks.

33:28.635 --> 33:30.690
(dramatic music)

33:30.690 --> 33:32.233
- Well, breaking news.

33:33.070 --> 33:34.253
First billion dead.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.830
- This disease isn't
really messing around, huh?

33:37.830 --> 33:40.200
- Guys again, we came here to get away.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.950
Why are you still talking about it?

33:42.980 --> 33:44.626
- Gentlemen, your table is ready.

33:44.626 --> 33:47.376
(dramatic music)

33:58.530 --> 33:59.700
- A billion, huh?

34:00.770 --> 34:02.410
- Shut up.

34:02.410 --> 34:03.830
- What got into you?

34:03.830 --> 34:05.870
- One, we came here to escape.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.200
I don't want to talk about it.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.310
And two, I could be at risk.

34:09.310 --> 34:12.010
I'm the one that has to worry
here, you guys are fine.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.380
- Well, we don't know that.

34:19.010 --> 34:21.298
- Gentlemen, what would you like to eat?

34:21.298 --> 34:22.783
- [Michael] We'll have three sandwiches.

34:22.783 --> 34:25.704
- Three sandwiches. Can
I get you anything else?

34:25.704 --> 34:27.260
- I don't think so.

34:27.260 --> 34:28.093
- Okay.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.327
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

34:37.713 --> 34:40.173
- Seriously, is there something wrong?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.800
- Okay yeah, there is.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.830
I wanted to tell you, but I
just don't want Michael to know.

34:48.830 --> 34:51.520
I don't want to talk about it right now.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.890
- What is it?

34:52.890 --> 34:54.880
- Look, I'll tell you when
we're back at the table

34:54.880 --> 34:56.358
and Michael gets up, okay?

34:56.358 --> 34:59.191
(dramatic music)

35:08.337 --> 35:10.020
- Is everything good?

35:10.020 --> 35:11.590
- Yup.

35:11.590 --> 35:12.423
- Now Jacob?

35:13.444 --> 35:14.277
- Now what?

35:14.277 --> 35:15.110
- Nothing.

35:17.496 --> 35:19.873
- Whatever, I'll be back.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.290
- So what do you want to tell me?

35:27.290 --> 35:28.540
- Okay.

35:28.540 --> 35:29.640
Do you remember when I was recovering

35:29.640 --> 35:32.280
from that lightning strike
a couple months ago?

35:32.280 --> 35:33.700
- Yeah.

35:33.700 --> 35:36.370
- And I made this person
up in my imagination

35:36.370 --> 35:38.060
to make me feel better?

35:38.060 --> 35:40.190
- What was her name, Ava, right?

35:40.190 --> 35:41.110
- Yeah.

35:41.110 --> 35:43.780
So I've been having these weird thoughts

35:43.780 --> 35:47.130
and visions of her or at
least someone like her.

35:47.130 --> 35:47.970
- When?

35:47.970 --> 35:48.880
- When what?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.040
- When did you have these visions?

35:50.040 --> 35:51.690
What time period was it?

35:51.690 --> 35:54.380
- I don't know, but this
is before my injury too.

35:54.380 --> 35:55.940
And they just pop in my head.

35:55.940 --> 35:57.120
- Oh my gosh.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.270
What if you're thinking of--

35:58.270 --> 36:00.320
- [Waiter] Gentlemen, your bill is ready.

36:01.720 --> 36:02.553
- Thanks.

36:02.553 --> 36:04.200
- [Waiter] Please pay when you're ready.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.370
- Anyway, what were you saying?

36:05.370 --> 36:08.580
- I mean, it's just, what if
you created Ava in your mind--

36:08.580 --> 36:10.693
- [Michael] All right,
are we about ready to go?

36:11.790 --> 36:12.623
- Yeah.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.670
- What time's our train leave?

36:17.670 --> 36:18.503
- 2:12.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.983
Anybody got a watch?

36:23.944 --> 36:24.823
What time is it?

36:24.823 --> 36:27.497
- 1:51, you guys go ahead,
I'll take care of the bill.

36:27.497 --> 36:28.510
- Are you sure?

36:28.510 --> 36:29.343
- Yeah.

36:29.343 --> 36:30.176
- Okay.

36:31.770 --> 36:32.603
- Thanks Michael.

36:32.603 --> 36:33.436
- Yeah.

36:45.430 --> 36:46.530
- So you were saying?

36:46.530 --> 36:48.970
- Okay, I'm just gonna say, Ava's real,

36:48.970 --> 36:52.830
and for some reason, she is
or at least was, spying on us.

36:52.830 --> 36:54.160
And again, I don't know why,

36:54.160 --> 36:57.110
but I think you saw her and
then recreated her from memory.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.480
- Okay, here's what I know,

37:00.480 --> 37:02.670
before the lightning
strike before anything,

37:02.670 --> 37:04.053
like a long time ago,

37:04.890 --> 37:05.970
I just remember the feeling

37:05.970 --> 37:07.997
of being watched, being spied on.

37:07.997 --> 37:10.110
- And you didn't bother telling us?

37:10.110 --> 37:11.990
- Look, I didn't think
it was a big deal, okay?

37:11.990 --> 37:13.310
- Yeah, having your privacy invaded

37:13.310 --> 37:16.100
isn't a big deal at all, but go on.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.550
- Whatever, so this person
could have been Ava,

37:18.550 --> 37:20.520
but I'm not totally sure.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.700
I'm just trying to figure out
why me and not someone else.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.750
- [Davis] Yeah, that is a little strange.

37:25.750 --> 37:27.550
- Like what would you be the motive?

37:30.850 --> 37:33.533
Wait, I think I know what's going on.

37:35.280 --> 37:38.110
Ava's trying to eliminate
the entire population

37:38.110 --> 37:39.893
except me and then kill me.

37:41.270 --> 37:43.800
- I mean, is it true?

37:43.800 --> 37:45.070
I mean, I don't even know what to say,

37:45.070 --> 37:47.540
but you got me really scared now.

37:47.540 --> 37:50.330
I do think we should tell Michael though.

37:50.330 --> 37:52.780
- [Jacob] Yeah, you're probably right.

37:52.780 --> 37:54.310
- Hey.

37:54.310 --> 37:56.350
Why aren't you on the train yet?

37:56.350 --> 37:57.460
- Michael, we have something

37:57.460 --> 37:59.359
extremely important to tell you.

37:59.359 --> 38:00.192
- We should probably get on the train,

38:00.192 --> 38:01.900
it leaves in like 10 minutes.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.250
- Whatever, I don't want
to waste time on this.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.660
- So what did you guys want to tell me?

38:11.660 --> 38:13.270
- [Davis] Ava is real.

38:13.270 --> 38:15.060
- Who the hell is Ava?

38:15.060 --> 38:16.800
- The person I made up.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.150
- Yeah, key word, made up.

38:19.150 --> 38:21.093
- No, Michael, just listen, okay?

38:22.130 --> 38:23.020
Before I got struck,

38:23.020 --> 38:24.230
I've been having these visions

38:24.230 --> 38:26.323
of someone that looks just like Ava.

38:27.490 --> 38:28.950
- [Michael] There's nothing
wrong with that, right?

38:28.950 --> 38:30.650
- [Davis] We're pretty sure
she was spying on Jacob,

38:30.650 --> 38:32.343
or even all three of us.

38:32.343 --> 38:34.300
- That doesn't make any sense.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.830
- Yes it does, if you
look at the backstory,

38:36.830 --> 38:38.359
I was going to ask Ava out the day

38:38.359 --> 38:40.836
that I decided to play
football with you guys,

38:40.836 --> 38:42.389
I was supposed to ask out Ava

38:42.389 --> 38:44.683
and I think she knew about
it, but I was okay with that.

38:44.683 --> 38:49.163
I guess she wasn't, so she's mad.

38:50.890 --> 38:54.120
- Okay, so maybe that
makes a little more sense,

38:54.120 --> 38:59.120
but maybe she died, you
know, the disease and all.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.893
- No, she didn't, she made it.

39:04.417 --> 39:06.060
And we're immune.

39:06.060 --> 39:07.930
- Okay, now you're just freaking me out.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.710
Okay, what the hell is going on?

39:09.710 --> 39:10.870
Tell me the truth.

39:10.870 --> 39:13.850
- Jacob's not lying and I'm not either.

39:13.850 --> 39:16.770
Ava's out there and she's after us.

39:16.770 --> 39:19.080
Jacob elaborate on your point.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.230
She made the disease.

39:21.230 --> 39:24.390
- Yeah, I think she wants
everyone dead before she kills us.

39:24.390 --> 39:26.070
I don't know why, but that's,

39:26.070 --> 39:28.100
I swear that's what's going on.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.763
- So does that mean she was
the one to steal the cure?

39:32.880 --> 39:34.070
- Damn right it does.

39:34.070 --> 39:36.630
- [Davis] Wait, but
how could we be immune?

39:36.630 --> 39:37.983
She never got our DNA.

39:39.021 --> 39:40.104
- Or did she?

39:41.767 --> 39:43.200
- Jacob, what's going on?

39:43.200 --> 39:45.150
- Well, I'm not a scientist,

39:45.150 --> 39:48.010
but there's DNA in blood, right?

39:48.010 --> 39:49.370
- [Davis] Oh my gosh.

39:49.370 --> 39:50.860
She has your DNA.

39:50.860 --> 39:51.893
She made you immune.

39:53.980 --> 39:55.180
- [Jacob] I can't do this.

39:55.180 --> 39:57.490
I should have killed
myself when I been chance.

39:57.490 --> 39:58.840
- [Michael] You don't mean that.

39:58.840 --> 40:01.528
- She's taking the entire
population of the planet.

40:01.528 --> 40:06.010
7.6 billion people, and bringing
it down to two, her and I.

40:06.010 --> 40:07.730
She's literally gonna torture me,

40:07.730 --> 40:09.220
and there's nothing I can do.

40:09.220 --> 40:12.104
Nobody I can call to help
me, nobody to kill her.

40:12.104 --> 40:14.663
No one else to be a witness,
no one else to stop her.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.580
- [Michael] It's going to be all right.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.320
- [Jacob] Yeah, for you when
you're dead in a couple months.

40:19.320 --> 40:22.830
- I mean, you said it
yourself 7.6 billion?

40:22.830 --> 40:24.330
And you think it's her?

40:24.330 --> 40:25.640
Maybe she was a coverup.

40:25.640 --> 40:29.500
- No way, I'm sticking in my
beliefs that it's really her.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.520
- Okay, but this just doesn't
make any sense, right?

40:31.520 --> 40:33.910
Okay, so she's mad at
us for some odd reason.

40:33.910 --> 40:35.450
Cause apparently you didn't ask her out.

40:35.450 --> 40:37.490
So how did she know you
were going to ask her out?

40:37.490 --> 40:38.840
That doesn't make any sense, right?

40:38.840 --> 40:40.800
But that's irrelevant, we'll
get back to that later.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.520
So essentially she's mad at you

40:43.520 --> 40:46.260
for not asking her out,
meaning that obviously,

40:46.260 --> 40:48.130
if she knew you were going to ask her out

40:48.130 --> 40:50.320
and she's mad, that means
she was going to say yes,

40:50.320 --> 40:51.770
meaning that she likes you too.

40:51.770 --> 40:54.230
So I don't understand why
she's trying to kill you,

40:54.230 --> 40:55.793
instead of, you know, help you.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.580
- Because she's mad at Jacob

40:59.580 --> 41:02.144
because he hung out
with us instead of her.

41:02.144 --> 41:03.860
- [Michael] So she's mad
at all of us, that's great.

41:03.860 --> 41:04.720
- [Jacob] Basically.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.880
- [Michael] Way to go
Jacob, you're such an idiot.

41:06.880 --> 41:07.713
Why would you play--

41:07.713 --> 41:09.720
- [Davis] Be quiet Michael,

41:09.720 --> 41:11.570
it's not his fault, it's ours.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.820
Why don't you open up
your eyes and see that?

41:17.470 --> 41:18.860
- Almost finished?

41:18.860 --> 41:20.137
- Just finishing now.

41:21.650 --> 41:22.483
Done.

41:23.420 --> 41:26.000
- Oh, here try some lemonade.

41:26.000 --> 41:26.887
- Is it cold?

41:26.887 --> 41:28.380
- Should be.

41:28.380 --> 41:29.420
- Why is it clear?

41:29.420 --> 41:30.820
- [Ava] Oh, I modified some lemons.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.470
They should already be sweet too.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.400
- Damn, that is really good.

41:37.490 --> 41:38.939
Have you tried it?

41:38.939 --> 41:40.506
- No.

41:40.506 --> 41:42.106
Not the biggest fan of lemonade.

41:43.300 --> 41:47.453
- Well, I'm telling you,
you are really missing out.

41:50.310 --> 41:54.973
- Wonderful. Mutations
are finally finished.

41:58.089 --> 42:00.382
- -as the cure was stolen.

42:00.382 --> 42:04.780
It has raised a lot of
questions, but quite frankly,

42:04.780 --> 42:09.780
I think most of them are
irrelevant in this time,

42:09.910 --> 42:12.580
where we are at, you know,

42:12.580 --> 42:17.030
we look at the population
and we're already down,

42:17.030 --> 42:19.590
you know, 5 billion people.

42:19.590 --> 42:22.690
I think that the, the real problem

42:22.690 --> 42:26.110
should be trying to recreate the cure

42:27.240 --> 42:29.900
even though there's not much time left.

42:29.900 --> 42:34.220
I still think that there's a
way that that could happen.

42:34.220 --> 42:35.780
But there's a lot of work--

42:35.780 --> 42:38.450
- Guys, we're gonna run
out of food pretty soon.

42:38.450 --> 42:39.523
- How much do we got?

42:40.532 --> 42:41.990
- A couple of weeks worth.

42:41.990 --> 42:43.940
- Yeah, that's a problem.

42:43.940 --> 42:46.070
Do we have a lot of canned goods though?

42:46.070 --> 42:46.903
- A few.

42:49.618 --> 42:51.910
Michael.

42:51.910 --> 42:53.563
Michael, what time is it?

42:57.551 --> 42:58.384
- 4:59.

42:59.732 --> 43:00.843
- Are you on the right channel?

43:05.966 --> 43:07.383
- Oh, here it is.

43:17.660 --> 43:18.980
- Good evening, everyone.

43:18.980 --> 43:23.050
I'm Peter and we have tragic
news being continued today.

43:23.050 --> 43:25.290
Almost 4.3 billion dead,

43:25.290 --> 43:28.570
and almost every single
person in the world infected,

43:28.570 --> 43:31.890
millions saying this is
truly the end of humanity.

43:31.890 --> 43:34.710
Others remain optimistic saying hundreds

43:34.710 --> 43:36.790
of thousands are immune.

43:36.790 --> 43:38.810
This disease is not stopping

43:38.810 --> 43:40.410
and has actually been discovered

43:40.410 --> 43:42.400
that many mutations have occurred

43:42.400 --> 43:44.220
over the past couple of weeks.

43:44.220 --> 43:47.290
More news to come on
this in a short while.

43:47.290 --> 43:48.870
- She's just trying to
speed the process up.

43:48.870 --> 43:50.210
- She's such a freak.

43:50.210 --> 43:53.320
- Oh really, is that who
we're dealing with here?

43:53.320 --> 43:54.920
- Hey, I'm just trying to emphasize

43:54.920 --> 43:57.250
the point that we're about to
be living in hell on earth.

43:57.250 --> 44:00.290
- Well don't, we don't
need that right now.

44:00.290 --> 44:01.223
- Dinner's ready.

44:02.095 --> 44:03.900
- Oh yeah, what'd you make?

44:03.900 --> 44:05.553
- [Davis] I made the can open up.

44:05.553 --> 44:09.520
- Ha ha, very funny.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.533
- [Jacob] What's the can
open up, sounds pretty good.

44:12.533 --> 44:16.440
- Seriously, how can
you guys be so cheerful

44:16.440 --> 44:19.600
when the world is literally ending.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.508
- Just gotta make the best of bad times.

44:21.508 --> 44:22.924
- Yeah.

44:22.924 --> 44:24.124
(distant goat scream)

44:25.123 --> 44:26.890
- Those neighbors.

44:26.890 --> 44:28.300
Everyone's going nuts these days.

44:28.300 --> 44:30.193
- Yeah, let's just hope we don't.

44:31.080 --> 44:32.133
- Well, let's eat.

44:37.210 --> 44:40.260
- Guys, it can't be that bad
being the last ones on Earth.

44:40.260 --> 44:42.550
I mean, we can go wherever we want,

44:42.550 --> 44:44.060
do whatever we want to do.

44:44.060 --> 44:46.160
I mean, the earth is ours after all.

44:46.160 --> 44:50.166
- And there's a psycho killer after us.

44:50.166 --> 44:51.767
- Let it go, Michael,
we're going to be fine.

44:51.767 --> 44:52.767
- Let it go?

44:54.400 --> 44:56.190
You know what, you're right.

44:56.190 --> 44:58.040
I'm done thinking about it,

44:58.040 --> 45:00.363
it's just going to have
the same end result.

45:01.540 --> 45:03.940
- Well, I guess that's
one way to look at it.

45:03.940 --> 45:05.190
Hey, at least we're living longer

45:05.190 --> 45:07.150
than every other person on the planet.

45:07.150 --> 45:09.450
Let's just make the most
of it, it's all we got

45:11.490 --> 45:14.850
- I must say, I could
get used to canned goods.

45:14.850 --> 45:16.100
- We're going to have to.

45:19.364 --> 45:22.290
- You know what, tomorrow
will be a new day.

45:22.290 --> 45:24.150
Yeah, a few more million will die,

45:24.150 --> 45:25.800
but we'll always have each other.

45:26.940 --> 45:29.733
- Yeah, I guess I'll see
you guys tomorrow then.

45:29.733 --> 45:31.123
- All right, sounds good.

45:40.493 --> 45:41.326
- Dang it.

46:04.310 --> 46:05.203
- That's strange.

46:08.700 --> 46:09.533
- Interesting.

46:13.170 --> 46:14.020
- There's no way.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.130
Not over night.

46:21.850 --> 46:22.683
- Nothing.

46:24.634 --> 46:25.634
That can't be right.

46:40.810 --> 46:42.400
- You guys don't think that?

46:42.400 --> 46:44.640
- No, yeah, it definitely got everyone.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.790
- [Michael] Over night?

46:49.220 --> 46:52.580
- Well, death can be really peaceful.

46:52.580 --> 46:53.940
I mean, they went to bed.

46:53.940 --> 46:55.420
They hit the snooze button,

46:55.420 --> 46:57.880
except this time the snooze was eternal.

46:57.880 --> 46:58.740
- Okay then.

46:58.740 --> 47:00.730
- [Jacob] Sorry, that was weird.

47:00.730 --> 47:03.260
- So that means it's just us.

47:03.260 --> 47:04.813
One, two, and three.

47:04.813 --> 47:06.850
- Well four is also out there somewhere.

47:06.850 --> 47:08.370
- And we don't have to go there,

47:08.370 --> 47:10.143
she's probably gone anyways.

47:11.140 --> 47:13.970
- Guys, in a couple days
I wanna try something.

47:13.970 --> 47:15.080
I don't wanna do it now,

47:15.080 --> 47:18.010
in case there's a few
extra straggler survivors

47:18.010 --> 47:20.760
that will get us in trouble
for leaving our house, but.

47:21.998 --> 47:22.831
- [Michael] What is it?

47:22.831 --> 47:25.540
- Well, I can't tell you, it's a surprise.

47:25.540 --> 47:27.710
- Have you guys given
any thought to the fact

47:27.710 --> 47:29.240
that we should probably find a way

47:29.240 --> 47:30.740
to bring back all of humanity?

47:31.770 --> 47:34.520
- I mean yeah, just no idea
in how we're gonna do that.

47:35.450 --> 47:37.310
I don't think we should
we worry about it anyway.

47:37.310 --> 47:39.230
- Clearly we don't have much power.

47:39.230 --> 47:42.020
- Yeah, we'll have to
figure something out.

47:42.020 --> 47:44.961
- We could just move out in the event

47:44.961 --> 47:46.420
that it gets like too hot or too cold.

47:46.420 --> 47:47.720
It's doesn't have to
be anything long term,

47:47.720 --> 47:48.950
just like, a month or two.

47:48.950 --> 47:50.200
- I mean, let's be honest,

47:50.200 --> 47:52.230
we have the entire planet to ourselves,

47:52.230 --> 47:53.860
there's not a single limitation.

47:53.860 --> 47:55.810
I say we just get an upgrade right now.

47:57.732 --> 48:00.482
(dramatic music)

48:03.625 --> 48:06.625
(suspenseful music)

49:25.460 --> 49:28.210
(dramatic music)

52:23.627 --> 52:24.960
- Jacob Andrews.

52:27.399 --> 52:29.156
I don't know a Jacob.

52:29.156 --> 52:31.906
(dramatic music)

52:50.173 --> 52:52.273
Empty peanut butter bottle.

52:54.900 --> 52:57.351
Guess the cabinet works as a trashcan.

52:57.351 --> 53:00.101
(dramatic music)

53:21.008 --> 53:22.290
(bread crunches)

53:22.290 --> 53:25.040
(dramatic music)

54:14.380 --> 54:16.593
There's gotta be somebody out there.

54:29.709 --> 54:32.962
- Well, what do you guys think?

54:32.962 --> 54:36.520
- Not gonna lie Jacob,
you really went all out.

54:36.520 --> 54:37.850
- You guys like it?

54:37.850 --> 54:39.800
- I mean, it's a little weird.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.750
For all we know there could be
a dozen dead corpses inside.

54:43.600 --> 54:46.563
- Well, or it could be our
house, or better yet, our home.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.860
- Yeah sorry Davis, I'm gonna
side with Jacob on this one.

54:50.860 --> 54:52.652
Let's get an upgrade.

54:52.652 --> 54:55.402
(dramatic music)

54:59.730 --> 55:03.100
- Now step aside Michel,
I'm a master lock picker.

55:03.100 --> 55:05.133
- Is that what your expertise is?

55:05.994 --> 55:09.440
- You know, some people just
understand me sometimes.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.640
People like you Michael.

55:11.745 --> 55:13.353
- [Michael] And that was a joke.

55:13.353 --> 55:16.940
- Looks like we're looking at
a typical stage two deadbolt,

55:16.940 --> 55:19.783
I have the tools in my
car, I'll be right back.

55:19.783 --> 55:22.533
(dramatic music)

55:33.299 --> 55:35.223
- It's already unlocked.

55:35.223 --> 55:37.973
(dramatic music)

55:52.798 --> 55:54.896
God, this place is insane.

55:54.896 --> 55:56.600
- How on earth did Jacob find this?

55:56.600 --> 55:57.613
- Not really sure.

55:58.655 --> 55:59.655
Is he still outside?

56:10.556 --> 56:12.960
(tools clatter)

56:12.960 --> 56:14.993
- Oh my God, this place is awesome.

56:15.836 --> 56:17.384
- [Davis] What do you think?

56:17.384 --> 56:18.420
- I don't know what to say,

56:18.420 --> 56:20.420
I mean, it's a huge upgrade
from our last place,

56:20.420 --> 56:22.820
but I'm going to go find
a room in the basement.

56:25.480 --> 56:26.840
- Michael.

56:26.840 --> 56:29.240
I think I know what's going on here.

56:29.240 --> 56:30.640
He's been here before.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.200
That's why the door was unlocked.

56:32.200 --> 56:34.560
I mean, we both know he can't pick a lock.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.670
He was just trying to impress us.

56:36.670 --> 56:37.570
- How do you know?

56:44.110 --> 56:46.270
He's trying too hard anyway.

56:46.270 --> 56:48.190
What do you think he
has in his room so far?

56:48.190 --> 56:50.555
- Not sure, let's check it out.

56:50.555 --> 56:51.980
But where'd he go?

56:51.980 --> 56:52.813
- The basement.

56:52.813 --> 56:53.910
I want to explore a little.

56:53.910 --> 56:54.743
- All right.

57:03.430 --> 57:04.467
- [Jacob] Pretty nice place.

57:04.467 --> 57:05.300
- Hey Jacob.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.390
- Hey Davis.

57:06.390 --> 57:08.860
Yeah, I got lost on my way down here.

57:08.860 --> 57:10.640
- Drop the act, I know
you've been here before.

57:10.640 --> 57:12.993
- What, I've never been
here in my entire life.

57:14.060 --> 57:15.573
- So explain this.

57:17.370 --> 57:21.170
- Fine, so I've been coming
here for the past week or so.

57:21.170 --> 57:22.180
- [Davis] What else is new?

57:22.180 --> 57:23.480
- [Jacob] Where's Michael?

57:23.480 --> 57:25.810
- Oh, I don't know, he's
exploring the place.

57:25.810 --> 57:27.130
- [Jacob] Oh, does he like it?

57:27.130 --> 57:29.640
- He's definitely a fan to say the least.

57:29.640 --> 57:30.870
- [Jacob] Kind of surprised by that.

57:30.870 --> 57:32.030
Let's go look for it.

57:32.030 --> 57:32.863
- All right.

57:32.863 --> 57:35.363
(eerie music)

57:39.020 --> 57:42.290
- Guys, think I just found my room.

57:42.290 --> 57:43.300
- [Jacob] What?

57:43.300 --> 57:44.240
No, no, no, no.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.440
You do not get the entire
basement as a bedroom.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.390
- You had the entire house for a week.

57:48.390 --> 57:50.770
- Yeah and I brought you
guys here. To my house!

57:50.770 --> 57:51.870
- Our house.

57:51.870 --> 57:54.900
- No, my house, and in my
house, I make the rules.

57:54.900 --> 57:56.590
And rule number one, you cannot have

57:56.590 --> 57:58.330
the entire basement as a bedroom.

57:58.330 --> 58:00.960
- [Michael] God, jeez, it was a joke.

58:00.960 --> 58:02.520
- I do think we should stay
in the basement though,

58:02.520 --> 58:04.720
just to reduce the odds of Ava finding us.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.410
But I mean, don't you think
it's just a little weird

58:06.410 --> 58:08.000
we're taking someone else's house?

58:08.000 --> 58:11.703
I mean, I know they're dead
and all, I don't know, still.

58:12.640 --> 58:14.260
- I don't care, I'm staying,

58:14.260 --> 58:16.000
you're right about the
basement thing though.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.220
- Yeah, I think Michael's right here.

58:17.220 --> 58:19.050
I mean, we haven't seen any dead people.

58:19.050 --> 58:21.470
There are no odors, no strange feelings.

58:21.470 --> 58:22.780
It just seems right.

58:22.780 --> 58:24.250
Plus it's a good protection from Ava.

58:24.250 --> 58:25.210
- Well, of course you think that,

58:25.210 --> 58:27.590
you've been living here for a week.

58:27.590 --> 58:28.640
Any thoughts Michael?

58:29.630 --> 58:33.510
- I already gave my
thoughts, I'm staying here,

58:33.510 --> 58:36.930
but if you have a problem with that,

58:36.930 --> 58:38.330
that's fine, you can go.

58:38.330 --> 58:41.110
But I think this is going to be the most

58:41.110 --> 58:43.570
beneficial for all of
us, you included Davis.

58:43.570 --> 58:45.203
- [Davis] Fine, just a few days.

58:46.042 --> 58:47.792
- [Jacob] A few days.

58:48.668 --> 58:51.168
(eerie music)

58:58.590 --> 59:00.330
- So Jacob, you said you had something

59:00.330 --> 59:01.960
you wanted to show us?

59:01.960 --> 59:03.820
- Yeah, tomorrow morning.

59:03.820 --> 59:05.950
Let's just say we won't go hungry.

59:05.950 --> 59:07.000
- Sure hope we don't.

59:08.740 --> 59:13.510
- Well, I think this
is working out nicely.

59:13.510 --> 59:15.683
Just this three of us, it's very peaceful.

59:19.580 --> 59:21.760
- I know, I know I'm getting to it.

59:21.760 --> 59:23.840
It's just a little weird sometimes.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.840
Overall I'd say it's pretty nice though.

59:26.750 --> 59:28.420
But don't you guys think
there's a possibility

59:28.420 --> 59:30.040
that there's someone else out there?

59:30.040 --> 59:33.070
- I mean, we'll never
know, but I do know this,

59:33.070 --> 59:34.150
that we have each other,

59:34.150 --> 59:37.380
and almost 200 million
square miles to enjoy.

59:37.380 --> 59:39.210
There are no issues with that.

59:39.210 --> 59:40.420
Now be up here tomorrow morning

59:40.420 --> 59:42.910
by around eight and we can leave then.

59:42.910 --> 59:44.240
- I'll be there.

59:44.240 --> 59:47.063
- Good, cause you're not to
want to miss this, believe me.

59:53.670 --> 59:54.728
Damn it.

59:54.728 --> 59:57.478
(dramatic music)

1:00:02.770 --> 1:00:04.740
I made it guys, don't
worry it's not eight yet.

1:00:04.740 --> 1:00:06.920
- Well it almost is.

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:08.080
I thought you were gonna sleep in.

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:10.150
- [Jacob] Yeah, whatever, let's go.

1:00:10.150 --> 1:00:11.890
- [Davis] So, where are we going?

1:00:11.890 --> 1:00:12.723
- [Jacob] Well genius,

1:00:12.723 --> 1:00:15.383
let me tell you something about surprises.

1:00:19.050 --> 1:00:21.800
(engine rumbles)

1:00:22.869 --> 1:00:27.369
- And yet another day of
pointless exploration begins.

1:00:28.330 --> 1:00:30.292
- So if I told you where we were going.

1:00:30.292 --> 1:00:31.142
- Okay, I get it.

1:00:32.380 --> 1:00:34.908
Let's just get there and then we'll see.

1:00:34.908 --> 1:00:37.658
(dramatic music)

1:00:47.710 --> 1:00:50.280
- Guys, have you put any thought

1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:52.990
into the fact that it's only us?

1:00:52.990 --> 1:00:57.660
I mean, duh, but if
you think about it, us,

1:00:57.660 --> 1:00:59.853
just us on this whole planet.

1:01:01.030 --> 1:01:01.993
What should we do?

1:01:05.860 --> 1:01:07.040
- Let's go.

1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:09.790
(dramatic music)

1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:22.990
- [Jacob] Guys, what's going on?

1:01:22.990 --> 1:01:25.070
- [Michael] You said it
yourself, it's only us,

1:01:25.070 --> 1:01:27.890
there's no hope for humanity.

1:01:27.890 --> 1:01:29.840
We're definitely going to get lonely.

1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:30.810
Hell we already are.

1:01:30.810 --> 1:01:33.100
I mean, we can't do this forever.

1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:34.500
- [Davis] Or can we?

1:01:34.500 --> 1:01:35.333
- [Michael] How the hell do you

1:01:35.333 --> 1:01:37.370
suppose we're going to do that?

1:01:37.370 --> 1:01:39.600
- [Davis] Let's do
something that we can enjoy.

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:41.540
Let's not focused on the downside.

1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:44.310
Let's give our lives a purpose.

1:01:44.310 --> 1:01:47.410
- [Jacob] I honestly don't know
how we're going to do that.

1:01:47.410 --> 1:01:50.200
- [Davis] Trust me, my gut tells me that

1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:52.910
something is going to
happen to change our lives.

1:01:52.910 --> 1:01:53.743
- [Michael] I am skeptical.

1:01:53.743 --> 1:01:55.250
- [Jacob] Yeah, same here.

1:01:55.250 --> 1:01:56.420
- [Michael] I think it's just difficult

1:01:56.420 --> 1:01:57.770
to find hope when you're the only

1:01:57.770 --> 1:01:59.760
freaking person left on the planet.

1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:01.020
- [Davis] And I completely understand what

1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:03.510
you're saying, but we
will get through this.

1:02:03.510 --> 1:02:05.423
- [Michael] Holy shit, what's that?

1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:14.166
- What the hell?

1:02:14.166 --> 1:02:19.166
(dramatic music)
(engine rumbles)

1:02:23.438 --> 1:02:26.188
(dramatic music)

1:02:29.110 --> 1:02:32.036
- Holy shit, I thought
I was the only one left.

1:02:32.036 --> 1:02:33.640
- We haven't seen anybody for weeks.

1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:35.290
Well except each other of course.

1:02:35.290 --> 1:02:36.860
- Hey, I'm Jacob, what's your name?

1:02:36.860 --> 1:02:37.950
- [Man] I'm Corben.

1:02:37.950 --> 1:02:40.120
- This is Michael and Davis.

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.490
- So when did you guys meet up?

1:02:42.490 --> 1:02:44.003
- Long before the disease.

1:02:45.420 --> 1:02:47.360
- Are you guys brothers?

1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:49.360
- Oh no, we're just friends.

1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:50.623
- [Corben] Just friends?

1:02:51.460 --> 1:02:52.680
And none of you died?

1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:53.710
- I mean, last time I checked,

1:02:53.710 --> 1:02:55.423
we're standing here talking to you.

1:02:57.590 --> 1:02:58.423
- [Michael] What?

1:02:58.423 --> 1:03:00.540
- I mean, there's gotta be some,

1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:05.540
some reason you survived,
some very strange reason.

1:03:06.020 --> 1:03:07.273
- Well, at least we are.

1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:09.570
- [Corben] Got me there.

1:03:09.570 --> 1:03:10.423
Well, do you guys live close?

1:03:10.423 --> 1:03:12.500
- [Michael] Yeah, just a few minutes away.

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:13.520
Want to come check out our place?

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:14.874
- I'd love to.

1:03:14.874 --> 1:03:17.624
(dramatic music)

1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:22.970
- Well, this is my place.

1:03:22.970 --> 1:03:24.480
- Oh, you guys split up?

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:25.920
- He means our place.

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:30.920
He thinks just because he
discovered it, it's his.

1:03:31.110 --> 1:03:33.178
- Was it before or after?

1:03:33.178 --> 1:03:34.011
- [Michael] After.

1:03:34.011 --> 1:03:35.810
- So it technically is his place.

1:03:35.810 --> 1:03:37.650
- Yeah, but he invited us here.

1:03:37.650 --> 1:03:39.530
- Okay, so then is all of your guys'.

1:03:39.530 --> 1:03:40.600
- Exactly.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:41.630
- Whatever.

1:03:41.630 --> 1:03:42.910
Hey Corben, if you're looking for a place

1:03:42.910 --> 1:03:44.640
to stay, we have an extra bed.

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.490
- Oh, I found a place just down the road,

1:03:46.490 --> 1:03:48.460
like a minute away,
I'm pretty happy there.

1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:49.293
- [Michael] Nice place?

1:03:49.293 --> 1:03:50.810
- Oh yeah, definitely.

1:03:50.810 --> 1:03:52.000
In fact, I'm going to head back there

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.480
right now and get some rest, eat.

1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:54.580
I'll see you guys in the morning.

1:03:54.580 --> 1:03:55.860
We can meet up for breakfast.

1:03:55.860 --> 1:03:56.693
- Sure.

1:03:56.693 --> 1:03:57.526
- All right, see you then.

1:03:57.526 --> 1:03:58.359
- See ya.

1:04:00.470 --> 1:04:02.425
- Well, he seemed like a nice guy.

1:04:02.425 --> 1:04:04.593
- Eh, he's like a six out of ten.

1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:14.200
- [Ava] Hello Jacob.

1:04:15.572 --> 1:04:16.722
- Who the hell are you?

1:04:18.260 --> 1:04:19.350
- You're not Jacob.

1:04:19.350 --> 1:04:21.123
- Damn right I'm not Jacob.

1:04:22.300 --> 1:04:24.380
Wait, would you happen to be referring

1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:26.023
to a Jacob that's alive?

1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:28.210
- What did you do with him?

1:04:28.210 --> 1:04:30.210
- I swear I didn't do anything with him.

1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:32.623
- Not one thing?

1:04:34.530 --> 1:04:36.560
Well, where is he, do
you know where he is?

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:37.600
- I'm sorry?

1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:39.050
- Do you know where he is?

1:04:39.050 --> 1:04:41.010
- Yes, yes, I know where he is.

1:04:41.010 --> 1:04:42.410
- [Ava] Then where is
he, will he be back soon?

1:04:42.410 --> 1:04:44.720
- Be back? What are you talking about?

1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:46.930
- [Ava] This is his house, isn't it?

1:04:46.930 --> 1:04:48.513
- No, this is my house.

1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:50.803
- He moved, damn it!

1:04:52.920 --> 1:04:54.500
Where is he?

1:04:54.500 --> 1:04:56.020
- [Corben] I'm sorry?

1:04:56.020 --> 1:04:57.690
- You said, you know where he is.

1:04:57.690 --> 1:04:59.200
Did you talk to him?

1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:02.167
- Yes, he introduced me to
his two very good friends.

1:05:02.167 --> 1:05:04.133
- His friends are alive?

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:06.910
- What is going on?

1:05:06.910 --> 1:05:08.201
- [Ava] Let me tell you

1:05:08.201 --> 1:05:10.180
a little something about Jacob Andrews.

1:05:10.180 --> 1:05:11.283
He's a killer.

1:05:12.707 --> 1:05:15.500
His friends, well, I don't
think they know this.

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:18.363
He's the one that stole the cure.

1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:22.050
He killed thousands of
people in his lifetime.

1:05:22.050 --> 1:05:23.620
He is a horribly person,

1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:26.313
that's an understatement,
he's a psychopath.

1:05:30.890 --> 1:05:32.253
I need to find him and destroy him.

1:05:33.420 --> 1:05:36.460
- This sounds fake, why wouldn't
he just murder his friends?

1:05:37.919 --> 1:05:41.683
- Friends, helpers, I'd lock your doors.

1:05:46.377 --> 1:05:48.023
And be careful of your every move.

1:05:49.780 --> 1:05:50.883
I'll see myself out.

1:05:53.290 --> 1:05:55.700
And don't forget to lock the door.

1:06:03.322 --> 1:06:04.552
Lock it!

1:06:04.552 --> 1:06:07.302
(dramatic music)

1:06:12.414 --> 1:06:14.487
(engine rumbles)

1:06:14.487 --> 1:06:17.154
One, two, three, four, and five.

1:06:29.900 --> 1:06:31.393
Jacob you damn fool.

1:06:33.670 --> 1:06:36.213
Don't worry though, I'll
be back with extra help.

1:06:51.910 --> 1:06:54.400
- I still can't believe
another person's alive,

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.870
and not only alive, but in our town.

1:06:56.870 --> 1:06:58.420
You think he's alone?

1:06:58.420 --> 1:06:59.981
- He has to be.

1:06:59.981 --> 1:07:00.814
Do you really think he'd be

1:07:00.814 --> 1:07:02.130
by himself if he found other people?

1:07:02.130 --> 1:07:03.443
- [Jacob] Yeah, good point.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.273
- Breakfast is served.

1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:11.890
- [Jacob] Davis, what the hell is this?

1:07:11.890 --> 1:07:13.600
- [Davis] It's cereal.

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:17.500
- This is not cereal, this
is soggy tortilla chips.

1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:19.453
- Hey, do you guys know anything about--

1:07:21.755 --> 1:07:23.320
What the hell is this?

1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:25.330
- [Davis] I'm doing my best, okay?

1:07:25.330 --> 1:07:28.160
- Whatever, do you guys
know anything about this?

1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:29.400
- [Jacob] It's an envelope.

1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:31.430
- Yeah, but it's got a
giant letter A on it.

1:07:31.430 --> 1:07:32.913
- Oh, it's A envelope.

1:07:34.050 --> 1:07:35.920
- Ha ha, whatever.

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:37.580
Should we read it?

1:07:37.580 --> 1:07:39.110
- [Davis] Nah, let's just
put it back in the yard.

1:07:39.110 --> 1:07:39.943
- Oh okay.

1:07:39.943 --> 1:07:41.230
- No, yes, of course open it.

1:07:41.230 --> 1:07:43.630
- God, I can't tell when
you're being sarcastic.

1:07:49.910 --> 1:07:52.660
(dramatic music)

1:07:53.780 --> 1:07:56.370
"There's always a beginning to the end.

1:07:56.370 --> 1:07:59.810
It is upon us and it cannot be reversed.

1:07:59.810 --> 1:08:04.530
One step at a time, we grow
closer to the end of the story.

1:08:04.530 --> 1:08:09.530
The darkness sweeps across the
cities, the silence begins.

1:08:09.890 --> 1:08:13.250
There is no cure for what
we've gotten ourselves into.

1:08:13.250 --> 1:08:16.890
It's been stolen and is
possessed in the wrong hands.

1:08:16.890 --> 1:08:19.740
The end is eternal, and the everlasting

1:08:19.740 --> 1:08:22.410
effects are eating us up alive.

1:08:22.410 --> 1:08:24.690
When we try to flip around our mistakes,

1:08:24.690 --> 1:08:26.910
the consequences strengthen,

1:08:26.910 --> 1:08:30.600
they grasp our arms and legs
then pin us to the ground.

1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:32.360
The ground suffocates our thoughts

1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:35.513
and our ability to think
dissolves into the silent wind.

1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:41.210
Hope is gone, and the only
ideas that hang by a thread

1:08:41.210 --> 1:08:44.513
are the Memories of Reality."

1:08:45.850 --> 1:08:48.030
- Hold on, go back to the cure part.

1:08:48.030 --> 1:08:49.750
- [Michael] There is no cure for what--

1:08:49.750 --> 1:08:51.190
- No, no, after that.

1:08:51.190 --> 1:08:52.220
- [Michael] It's been stolen

1:08:52.220 --> 1:08:54.000
and is possessed in the wrong hands.

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.410
- Ava, damn it.

1:08:55.410 --> 1:08:56.243
I knew she was behind this.

1:08:56.243 --> 1:08:57.780
- [Michael] Come on
Jacob, we don't know that.

1:08:57.780 --> 1:08:58.613
- Get in the car.

1:08:58.613 --> 1:08:59.768
- [Davis] Jacob.

1:08:59.768 --> 1:09:00.753
- I said get in the car!

1:09:06.543 --> 1:09:09.126
(door knocks)

1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:12.170
- Knock, knock, it's Ava.

1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:15.070
- Hey, any signs of Jacob?

1:09:15.070 --> 1:09:16.383
- Unfortunately, no, you?

1:09:17.390 --> 1:09:19.630
- No, I don't think
they know where I live.

1:09:19.630 --> 1:09:20.570
- [Ava] Don't tell them.

1:09:20.570 --> 1:09:21.920
- Yeah, I definitely won't.

1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:26.900
- [Ava] Hey, I was wondering
if you wanted to help me out?

1:09:26.900 --> 1:09:27.750
- [Corben] Go on.

1:09:29.678 --> 1:09:31.260
- [Ava] We need to kill Jacob.

1:09:31.260 --> 1:09:32.150
- Is that it?

1:09:32.150 --> 1:09:34.170
I mean, I don't want to kill anybody,

1:09:34.170 --> 1:09:35.820
but can you just do that with a gun?

1:09:35.820 --> 1:09:38.210
- No, we can't scare his friends off.

1:09:38.210 --> 1:09:39.290
- [Corben] What are you saying?

1:09:39.290 --> 1:09:40.480
- We need to capture Jacob,

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:43.780
have him kill his friends for
us, and then we can kill him.

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:46.040
- [Corben] How do we know
his friends are also killers?

1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:49.450
- They just are, they're
definitely Jacob's helpers.

1:09:49.450 --> 1:09:51.550
- [Corben] Okay, if you say so.

1:09:51.550 --> 1:09:53.703
- Well, are you willing to help?

1:09:54.674 --> 1:09:56.374
And there's only one right answer.

1:09:58.650 --> 1:09:59.813
- Yeah, I'll do it.

1:10:12.310 --> 1:10:13.143
- What the?

1:10:16.750 --> 1:10:17.793
Guys, come here!

1:10:21.514 --> 1:10:22.347
- What is it?

1:10:22.347 --> 1:10:23.180
- [Davis] Michael, what letter did

1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:24.013
that last envelope have on it?

1:10:24.013 --> 1:10:25.033
- [Michael] It said A.

1:10:27.420 --> 1:10:29.670
- [Davis] I think I know what's going on.

1:10:29.670 --> 1:10:30.583
These are clues.

1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:38.570
"The truth is there is a cure,
you just need to find it.

1:10:38.570 --> 1:10:42.420
I will not live another week
on this planet, but you will.

1:10:42.420 --> 1:10:44.930
I mean, you're reading
this message right now.

1:10:44.930 --> 1:10:47.710
Humanity's hope is in your hands.

1:10:47.710 --> 1:10:49.620
What will you do with this power?

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:52.080
Well, it isn't power yet.

1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:54.830
Find the next 24
envelopes, you must hurry.

1:10:54.830 --> 1:10:56.063
The cure was stolen.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.560
That may not be the only
thing that was stolen.

1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:02.640
Find every envelope in
the order of the alphabet.

1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:07.050
Hurry, you don't have long,
death is after you as well."

1:11:07.050 --> 1:11:09.790
Dang, we need to find these.

1:11:09.790 --> 1:11:10.720
What does this mean?

1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:11.790
- Whoever stole the cure--

1:11:11.790 --> 1:11:13.400
- Ava.

1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:14.570
- --is after us as well.

1:11:14.570 --> 1:11:16.220
- Meaning we need to find the envelopes

1:11:16.220 --> 1:11:19.210
because she, or whoever it
is, wants to destroy them.

1:11:19.210 --> 1:11:21.060
- Well, we should split up
and try and go find them.

1:11:21.060 --> 1:11:22.883
- They're trying to bait
us to their hideout.

1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:26.170
- Davis is right, this feels
too much like a set-up,

1:11:26.170 --> 1:11:29.470
like we should still
go after the envelopes,

1:11:29.470 --> 1:11:32.320
but I think we should be really cautious.

1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:34.660
- And I've been trying to tell everybody

1:11:34.660 --> 1:11:37.676
that it was Jacob all along,
but they didn't believe it.

1:11:37.676 --> 1:11:40.780
- I mean, I understand that,

1:11:40.780 --> 1:11:43.010
you know, I'm just trying to think,

1:11:43.010 --> 1:11:46.540
like imagine if the person
responsible for wiping out

1:11:46.540 --> 1:11:49.450
the entire population
lived in your community.

1:11:49.450 --> 1:11:52.420
And I mean, obviously
in this case he does,

1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:54.560
but I'm just trying to put that in into

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:56.853
perspective for somebody
that doesn't know.

1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:00.480
- Yeah, I completely get it.

1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:04.880
It's just like, if they even
considered all their options,

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:07.380
billions of people would
still be alive right now.

1:12:09.260 --> 1:12:11.603
- So how are we going to go about this?

1:12:14.050 --> 1:12:15.943
- Well, I have a new idea.

1:12:16.990 --> 1:12:19.440
Get Jacob to confess.
He never will I imagine,

1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:22.110
but it's worth a shot.

1:12:22.110 --> 1:12:23.060
- Confess, to what?

1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:27.233
- [Ava] To killing off the human race.

1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:29.283
Now here's my idea.

1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:33.500
We kidnap Jacob, and he either

1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:36.510
confesses or he kills his friends.

1:12:36.510 --> 1:12:38.833
If he confesses, we'll punish him,

1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:43.220
and if he doesn't well,
we'll kill his friends

1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:44.370
and then kill him.

1:12:44.370 --> 1:12:46.620
Obviously, if he doesn't
confess after that.

1:12:46.620 --> 1:12:48.473
- Damn, you're dark.

1:12:49.350 --> 1:12:50.543
- Right, I am dark.

1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:52.520
Well, I can assure you.

1:12:52.520 --> 1:12:55.884
I'm not the one who killed
off 7.5 billion people.

1:12:55.884 --> 1:12:56.717
- Right.

1:12:57.980 --> 1:12:59.480
- [Ava] So let's get started.

1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:01.650
- [Davis] We should keep our
eyes out for the next envelope.

1:13:01.650 --> 1:13:02.590
C right?

1:13:02.590 --> 1:13:04.870
- [Jacob] Yeah, Michael, where
did you find the first one?

1:13:04.870 --> 1:13:07.060
- It was in our backyard.

1:13:07.060 --> 1:13:08.210
- Great, so these things are just

1:13:08.210 --> 1:13:09.450
floating around in the open wind.

1:13:09.450 --> 1:13:10.580
Are we're not supposed to solve these

1:13:10.580 --> 1:13:12.610
until we turn 90 or something?

1:13:12.610 --> 1:13:13.710
- [Davis] You do make a good point.

1:13:13.710 --> 1:13:15.490
I mean the odds of
finding every single paper

1:13:15.490 --> 1:13:17.350
in chronological order of the alphabet

1:13:17.350 --> 1:13:20.240
in the open have to be at
least a million to one.

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:21.850
There's no way we can do this.

1:13:21.850 --> 1:13:25.922
- However, it has given
us something to live for.

1:13:25.922 --> 1:13:27.160
- [Michael] We should just give it a shot.

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:29.070
See where we end up.

1:13:29.070 --> 1:13:29.990
- [Davis] There has to be a clue

1:13:29.990 --> 1:13:32.550
in one of those notes that
leads to the next one.

1:13:32.550 --> 1:13:33.873
What could have been in
the letter A envelope

1:13:33.873 --> 1:13:36.730
that could lead us into
the location of letter B?

1:13:36.730 --> 1:13:38.320
Michael, do you still have the letter?

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:39.733
- [Michael] Yeah, I got it right here.

1:13:41.490 --> 1:13:42.350
- [David] Oh, found it.

1:13:42.350 --> 1:13:43.313
- The letter C?

1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:46.640
- No, what led us to B.

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.280
It says here, "and our ability

1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:50.143
to think dissolves in a silent wind."

1:13:51.170 --> 1:13:53.870
This has to be referring
to the note drifting away.

1:13:53.870 --> 1:13:55.820
Hopefully this is the only one outside.

1:13:57.930 --> 1:13:59.720
- And you're sure this is gonna work?

1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:00.990
- We'll find out when you try it.

1:14:00.990 --> 1:14:02.450
- Me?

1:14:02.450 --> 1:14:03.760
- Yes, you.

1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:06.860
Now get up and go prepare,
and find the handcuffs.

1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:09.143
I want this done by the end of the week.

1:14:10.290 --> 1:14:12.340
You never know when he could strike next.

1:14:16.550 --> 1:14:18.100
- What did the second note say?

1:14:22.090 --> 1:14:23.810
- "The truth is there is a cure,

1:14:23.810 --> 1:14:25.440
I'm in the hospital, I'm dying.

1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:27.560
Humanity's hope is in your hands."

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:30.140
- Humanity's hope is in your hands.

1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:31.650
That's gotta be a clue, right?

1:14:31.650 --> 1:14:33.590
There's something there.

1:14:33.590 --> 1:14:35.190
Hands, your hands?

1:14:35.190 --> 1:14:37.130
- I'm sure we'll figure it out eventually.

1:14:37.130 --> 1:14:38.910
- Wait, Michael, don't move.

1:14:38.910 --> 1:14:41.173
Your hands, your hand
is right on top of it.

1:14:43.270 --> 1:14:45.130
- [Davis] Okay, these clues are horrible.

1:14:45.130 --> 1:14:46.470
- [Michael] Yeah, the old
bastard couldn't give us

1:14:46.470 --> 1:14:48.087
something to work off of?

1:14:48.087 --> 1:14:49.450
- How do you know it's an old bastard?

1:14:49.450 --> 1:14:51.070
Maybe it could be a 10
year old writing there.

1:14:51.070 --> 1:14:52.830
- Oh yeah, because every 10 year old

1:14:52.830 --> 1:14:55.290
knows the cure to humanity's death

1:14:55.290 --> 1:14:57.450
when there's only four
people left on the planet.

1:14:57.450 --> 1:14:59.980
- [Jacob] Technically there are five.

1:14:59.980 --> 1:15:01.280
- It's C right?

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:02.680
- [Jacob] Yeah, yeah it's C.

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:04.743
- [Davis] What's it say?

1:15:07.940 --> 1:15:09.860
- My days are nearing the end.

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:11.590
I may be skipping the next few letters

1:15:11.590 --> 1:15:12.990
and working backwards, starting with

1:15:12.990 --> 1:15:15.610
the answers in X, Y, and Z.

1:15:15.610 --> 1:15:17.530
You must still go in order though.

1:15:17.530 --> 1:15:20.570
The letters that I skipped
will be written on note D.

1:15:20.570 --> 1:15:23.530
You must still find them, but
they may not have any writing.

1:15:23.530 --> 1:15:25.863
You're getting even
closer to saving humanity.

1:15:26.910 --> 1:15:29.610
- Why do we need to find them
if there's no writing on them?

1:15:29.610 --> 1:15:31.783
- They have to be used for something.

1:15:33.170 --> 1:15:34.420
I'm just not sure what.

1:15:34.420 --> 1:15:35.850
- Maybe we can work backwards with

1:15:35.850 --> 1:15:36.950
the ones with answers on them.

1:15:36.950 --> 1:15:38.920
- That would be difficult considering

1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:40.270
if we had worked backwards at this point,

1:15:40.270 --> 1:15:41.350
nothing would have happened,

1:15:41.350 --> 1:15:43.100
we would have gotten nothing done.

1:15:43.100 --> 1:15:46.280
I just don't understand
why we need to find them

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:47.450
if there's nothing on them,

1:15:47.450 --> 1:15:50.547
it's not like we're going to
put them in a paper shredder,

1:15:50.547 --> 1:15:52.353
and it'll explode in a beacon of light.

1:15:53.444 --> 1:15:54.600
- Codes!

1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:55.433
- [Michael] What?

1:15:55.433 --> 1:15:56.266
- They're codes.

1:15:56.266 --> 1:15:57.520
We need to find each envelope in order

1:15:57.520 --> 1:15:59.910
to get the full code to solve the cure.

1:15:59.910 --> 1:16:02.070
- Yeah, and then each
letter will have the answer,

1:16:02.070 --> 1:16:04.550
meaning that I assume Z is the last code.

1:16:04.550 --> 1:16:07.380
- Why does it sound so true to
the point where it's creepy?

1:16:07.380 --> 1:16:09.527
- Yeah, I know it does
sound weird, but I mean,

1:16:09.527 --> 1:16:11.660
it has to be right.

1:16:11.660 --> 1:16:13.210
- Davis for once I'm actually sold

1:16:13.210 --> 1:16:15.190
on one of your crazy ideas.

1:16:15.190 --> 1:16:16.210
- I'm sure you're not serious,

1:16:16.210 --> 1:16:18.400
but I've never heard you say
that before, so I'll take it.

1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:20.440
- Okay guys, our top priority

1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:22.610
has to be finding these letters.

1:16:22.610 --> 1:16:23.770
The quicker we find the letters,

1:16:23.770 --> 1:16:25.750
the quicker that we save humanity.

1:16:25.750 --> 1:16:27.030
But how the hell are we supposed

1:16:27.030 --> 1:16:29.320
to find D with what C gave us?

1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:30.313
- [Davis] Wait a minute.

1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:34.477
- [Jacob] Oh, there's no way, what?

1:16:34.477 --> 1:16:35.793
- Huh, letter D.

1:16:36.810 --> 1:16:38.000
- [Jacob] This has to
be staged or something.

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.200
Is it staged to make us feel better?

1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:41.740
- [Davis] No, I swear it isn't.

1:16:41.740 --> 1:16:44.223
- [Michael] Why there
though? Of all the places.

1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:47.780
- [Jacob] Well, the guy here
before was hospitalized,

1:16:47.780 --> 1:16:52.010
so that explains why all the
letters are all around here.

1:16:52.010 --> 1:16:52.843
- That also explains why there

1:16:52.843 --> 1:16:54.980
are no dead people in the house.

1:16:54.980 --> 1:16:56.930
- Do you think there's
more letters in the house?

1:16:56.930 --> 1:16:58.435
- [Michael] Well, open that one first.

1:16:58.435 --> 1:16:59.268
- Yeah.

1:17:01.850 --> 1:17:04.310
It says "I'm not doing so well.

1:17:04.310 --> 1:17:06.530
They're taking me to the hospital today.

1:17:06.530 --> 1:17:08.970
I probably only have
a few days left in me.

1:17:08.970 --> 1:17:11.250
I lived longer than most.

1:17:11.250 --> 1:17:14.150
I wrote W, X, Y, and Z.

1:17:14.150 --> 1:17:16.280
Every letter between then
and now will be blank,

1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:18.676
but it's still crucial to find them.

1:17:18.676 --> 1:17:20.880
They are in the presence of this house.

1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:23.530
I decided to spread
them out and hide them.

1:17:23.530 --> 1:17:25.970
So they don't fall into the wrong hands.

1:17:25.970 --> 1:17:28.650
You must search thoroughly.

1:17:28.650 --> 1:17:31.100
It could be in spots
you would never imagine,

1:17:31.100 --> 1:17:34.600
but find them, W is in the house.

1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:36.773
The final three are not."

1:17:37.970 --> 1:17:41.130
- So we got to tear up this
house, looking inside and out.

1:17:41.130 --> 1:17:42.710
Look everywhere, guys.

1:17:42.710 --> 1:17:43.543
- Let's go.

1:17:50.740 --> 1:17:53.410
- [Corben] So how long will this take?

1:17:53.410 --> 1:17:55.060
- Until it's finished.

1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:57.770
- [Corben] And how long might that be?

1:17:57.770 --> 1:17:59.770
- You like questions, don't you?

1:17:59.770 --> 1:18:01.920
- Okay, it's just that I've never

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:03.870
done anything like this before.

1:18:03.870 --> 1:18:06.720
- Killed some, captured a serial killer?

1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:07.553
- [Corben] What?

1:18:08.530 --> 1:18:10.780
- You've never captured
a serial killer before?

1:18:10.780 --> 1:18:13.500
- Oh, I thought you said
something else, but no.

1:18:13.500 --> 1:18:15.693
It's not a common experience people share.

1:18:16.580 --> 1:18:17.970
Have you?

1:18:17.970 --> 1:18:20.653
- Many times, I put
them where they belong.

1:18:21.846 --> 1:18:23.453
- [Corben] Well, at least
you have experience.

1:18:23.453 --> 1:18:24.653
- It's what I'm best at.

1:18:27.530 --> 1:18:29.780
- So how are we going
to go about doing this?

1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:32.200
- [Ava] We're going to go to his house,

1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:34.380
wait until he goes outside alone.

1:18:34.380 --> 1:18:35.890
Then capture him when he's far enough away

1:18:35.890 --> 1:18:39.100
from his friends, so they
won't be a disturbance.

1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:40.960
- What if his friends follow us?

1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:43.890
- I'll just shout to you and
you'll just follow along.

1:18:43.890 --> 1:18:45.130
- [Corben] All right, I guess I'll just

1:18:45.130 --> 1:18:46.780
follow your lead the entire time.

1:18:51.710 --> 1:18:53.100
- So what'd you guys get?

1:18:53.100 --> 1:18:58.100
- I got F, Q, M, L, R, O.

1:19:01.230 --> 1:19:06.230
- I got N, E, U, P, T, G, and J.

1:19:08.690 --> 1:19:12.633
- I got I, S, K, V, and H.

1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:16.050
- So does that leave us left with?

1:19:16.050 --> 1:19:17.930
- W, it's the only one left with writing.

1:19:17.930 --> 1:19:19.890
- Organize these A through V,

1:19:19.890 --> 1:19:21.440
we don't want to lose any them.

1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:23.370
- [Davis] Double check letter D

1:19:23.370 --> 1:19:24.993
to make sure W is in the house.

1:19:26.790 --> 1:19:29.110
- W's in the house, the
other three are not.

1:19:29.110 --> 1:19:32.500
- It's in here, we just don't know where.

1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:34.125
- Let's go find it.

1:19:34.125 --> 1:19:36.590
- I'm hungry, when are we gonna have food?

1:19:36.590 --> 1:19:38.470
- I can go look for something.

1:19:38.470 --> 1:19:40.580
- Alright and when you're
gone, we'll look for W.

1:19:40.580 --> 1:19:41.900
- Sounds great.

1:19:41.900 --> 1:19:43.323
- And if you see Corben

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:45.350
tell him we say hi.

1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:49.080
We'll try to find W before you get back.

1:19:52.430 --> 1:19:53.900
- Damn, that was sooner than I thought.

1:19:53.900 --> 1:19:56.672
- How long did you think
this was going to take?

1:19:56.672 --> 1:19:57.700
- At least a week.

1:19:57.700 --> 1:19:58.560
- A week?

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:00.230
You were going to have
me sitting out here,

1:20:00.230 --> 1:20:02.810
staring at a house for a week?

1:20:02.810 --> 1:20:04.330
- Hey, hey, you don't have to though.

1:20:04.330 --> 1:20:06.080
- Okay, but have you ever heard the phrase

1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:07.770
it's the thought that counts?

1:20:07.770 --> 1:20:10.390
- Okay, well, that doesn't
apply in this situation.

1:20:10.390 --> 1:20:12.010
- I honestly hate you.

1:20:12.010 --> 1:20:13.570
- Hey, me or a serial killer.

1:20:13.570 --> 1:20:15.740
Now, come on, let's go after him.

1:20:15.740 --> 1:20:20.370
- So do you think we can find
W before Jacob gets back?

1:20:20.370 --> 1:20:22.370
- Depends on how long he's gone for.

1:20:22.370 --> 1:20:25.830
Closest food could be anywhere
from 3 to 30 miles away.

1:20:25.830 --> 1:20:27.660
I'd give him until midnight
before he gets back.

1:20:27.660 --> 1:20:29.613
- There's gotta be something here.

1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:34.187
- [Davis] Michael, what's that?

1:20:34.187 --> 1:20:35.387
- [Michael] What's what?

1:20:37.790 --> 1:20:39.440
- Found it.

1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:40.780
- You're kidding.

1:20:40.780 --> 1:20:42.120
What does it say?

1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:43.293
- Let's just see here.

1:20:44.990 --> 1:20:47.670
I think I need to wrap
it up on one more note.

1:20:47.670 --> 1:20:49.380
I'm really struggling right now.

1:20:49.380 --> 1:20:50.800
You are three away.

1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:53.200
X will be the easiest
of the three to find.

1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:55.810
It will become more
difficult to find after that.

1:20:55.810 --> 1:20:58.260
You must go to forests, rivers and lakes,

1:20:58.260 --> 1:21:00.473
trees, rocks, leaves, and docks.

1:21:02.180 --> 1:21:03.013
- Is that it?

1:21:04.300 --> 1:21:05.133
- I guess so.

1:21:05.133 --> 1:21:07.400
We should probably wait for
Jacob before we start looking.

1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:09.530
I really don't want to go
out at this time anyways.

1:21:09.530 --> 1:21:12.497
- Okay, so do you think we
should stay up for him or?

1:21:14.586 --> 1:21:15.419
- I don't know.

1:21:15.419 --> 1:21:16.410
You hungry?

1:21:16.410 --> 1:21:19.180
- Honestly, finding the note

1:21:20.260 --> 1:21:23.470
didn't really make me hungry anymore.

1:21:23.470 --> 1:21:24.920
- About, Jacob, we should probably

1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:26.660
just go to bed and then
eat in the morning.

1:21:26.660 --> 1:21:29.150
I mean, who knows how
long he could be gone for.

1:21:29.150 --> 1:21:31.250
- Cool, should be
excited to hear the news.

1:21:31.250 --> 1:21:32.203
- Yeah, for sure.

1:21:33.290 --> 1:21:35.110
Well, good night.

1:21:35.110 --> 1:21:36.010
- [Michael] Night.

1:21:41.180 --> 1:21:42.880
- Oh duck down, I think he saw us.

1:21:43.886 --> 1:21:46.465
- He just thinks we're his friends.

1:21:46.465 --> 1:21:49.465
(suspenseful music)

1:22:12.295 --> 1:22:13.128
- Hey Corben.

1:22:13.128 --> 1:22:14.474
- Oh, hey.

1:22:14.474 --> 1:22:19.474
Oh you know, I'm just out
here, looking for some food.

1:22:19.550 --> 1:22:20.383
- Oh yeah.

1:22:20.383 --> 1:22:21.216
- What about you?

1:22:21.216 --> 1:22:22.310
- Same here, actually.

1:22:22.310 --> 1:22:24.180
Oh, hey, we got some great
news today, actually.

1:22:24.180 --> 1:22:25.220
- [Corben] Really, what is that?

1:22:25.220 --> 1:22:27.350
- [Jacob] Yeah, we've been
finding these envelopes

1:22:27.350 --> 1:22:29.960
and they all have letters
on them, like the alphabet.

1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:31.770
And we think it's gonna lead

1:22:31.770 --> 1:22:33.810
to the cure to bring back humanity.

1:22:33.810 --> 1:22:34.973
- Really?

1:22:34.973 --> 1:22:35.810
- Yeah.

1:22:35.810 --> 1:22:37.330
We only have four more left to find,

1:22:37.330 --> 1:22:39.830
but we're really close it seems like.

1:22:39.830 --> 1:22:40.663
- [Corben] That's, that's awesome.

1:22:40.663 --> 1:22:42.049
- Corben now!

1:22:42.049 --> 1:22:43.875
- What the hell, what's going on?

1:22:43.875 --> 1:22:45.395
Hey, get off of me.

1:22:45.395 --> 1:22:48.145
(dramatic music)

1:22:50.770 --> 1:22:53.267
What, Ava, you're behind this?

1:22:53.267 --> 1:22:56.017
(dramatic music)

1:22:57.358 --> 1:22:59.191
- Just get in the car.

1:23:03.274 --> 1:23:05.910
- [Jacob] You're the one behind
this? What are you doing?

1:23:05.910 --> 1:23:07.163
- [Ava] Captured the serial killer.

1:23:07.163 --> 1:23:09.098
- Serial killer, what?

1:23:09.098 --> 1:23:11.347
Corben, you gotta believe
me, I'm not a serial killer.

1:23:11.347 --> 1:23:12.810
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1:23:12.810 --> 1:23:14.190
- Ava's the one that stole the cure,

1:23:14.190 --> 1:23:15.520
she's the one that started all of this.

1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:18.689
- Shut up Jacob, Corben, get in the car.

1:23:18.689 --> 1:23:19.587
- [Corben] Ava, what's going on?

1:23:19.587 --> 1:23:20.555
- Get in the car.

1:23:20.555 --> 1:23:23.305
(dramatic music)

1:23:30.750 --> 1:23:33.687
No, not another move, both of you.

1:23:36.165 --> 1:23:38.973
- You are the killer, aren't you?

1:23:38.973 --> 1:23:40.503
- Both of you, shut up.

1:23:43.937 --> 1:23:45.107
We'll be arriving soon enough.

1:23:45.107 --> 1:23:47.857
(dramatic music)

1:24:03.910 --> 1:24:05.630
- Jacob, you awake?

1:24:05.630 --> 1:24:06.463
- Yeah.

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:08.233
- I was wrong.

1:24:09.117 --> 1:24:10.140
I shouldn't have listened to her.

1:24:10.140 --> 1:24:11.260
She's just--

1:24:11.260 --> 1:24:13.363
- I know, she screw with my mind too.

1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:16.150
I don't even get what her motives were.

1:24:16.150 --> 1:24:18.490
She's just unpredictable.

1:24:18.490 --> 1:24:19.540
- [Corben] I'm sorry.

1:24:20.730 --> 1:24:22.130
- No, don't be seriously.

1:24:22.130 --> 1:24:23.510
You did nothing wrong.

1:24:23.510 --> 1:24:25.350
- I shouldn't have helped her.

1:24:25.350 --> 1:24:27.530
- No, you were just trying
to protect yourself.

1:24:27.530 --> 1:24:28.723
She's dangerous.

1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:31.420
- Okay, we need to bust out of here.

1:24:31.420 --> 1:24:32.400
- I still don't get why she

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:34.440
wants us though, specifically me.

1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:36.570
- Okay, I'm just going to say it.

1:24:36.570 --> 1:24:38.170
She wants you to kill your friends

1:24:38.170 --> 1:24:41.493
and then she's gonna kill you.

1:24:41.493 --> 1:24:43.243
- Yeah, I'm not at all surprised.

1:24:44.350 --> 1:24:46.110
Anyway, how are we going to do this?

1:24:46.110 --> 1:24:47.623
- Let's both stand up first.

1:24:52.220 --> 1:24:53.643
- Can you get an arm through?

1:24:55.290 --> 1:24:56.890
- See if you can get an arm out.

1:24:57.980 --> 1:24:59.283
Okay, all right.

1:25:00.381 --> 1:25:02.330
Good, you got the rope untied?

1:25:02.330 --> 1:25:03.330
- Yeah, got it.

1:25:03.330 --> 1:25:04.163
- [Corben] All right.

1:25:04.163 --> 1:25:06.560
Looks like she's not as
smart as she appears.

1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:08.160
- [Jacob] Let's get out of here.

1:25:11.119 --> 1:25:12.619
- Going somewhere?

1:25:14.157 --> 1:25:14.990
You're not going anywhere.

1:25:14.990 --> 1:25:16.520
Corben, get the hell out of here.

1:25:19.060 --> 1:25:21.827
Jacob, I have a job for you.

1:25:23.270 --> 1:25:24.977
- Corben already told me.

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:27.153
- [Ava] Do it.

1:25:27.153 --> 1:25:28.180
- You're such a freak.

1:25:28.180 --> 1:25:29.440
- [Ava] What did Corben tell you?

1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:30.970
- To go kill my friends.

1:25:30.970 --> 1:25:33.300
- [Ava] Then nothing stands in your way.

1:25:33.300 --> 1:25:34.950
- What the hell is wrong with you?

1:25:34.950 --> 1:25:36.250
- [Ava] Kill them.

1:25:36.250 --> 1:25:37.253
- Kill me.

1:25:38.290 --> 1:25:39.123
- [Ava] What?

1:25:39.123 --> 1:25:40.160
- I said kill me.

1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:42.560
If you have the guts to
tell someone to go kill

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:45.160
their friends, it should
be no issue ending my life.

1:25:46.290 --> 1:25:47.440
- Go kill your friends.

1:25:50.610 --> 1:25:53.650
I'm not gonna kill you, but
I'm gonna leave that up to you,

1:25:53.650 --> 1:25:57.230
and you're going to stay
here until I come back.

1:25:57.230 --> 1:25:58.380
And I'll leave this here with you

1:25:58.380 --> 1:25:59.307
until you're ready to do it.

1:25:59.307 --> 1:26:01.200
- Yeah, and where are you going?

1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:02.820
- Well I can't end humanity this way.

1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:05.930
Then I guess I'm just gonna
have to find the envelopes

1:26:05.930 --> 1:26:08.330
that supposedly contain
the cure and destroy them.

1:26:08.330 --> 1:26:10.163
- Yeah, good luck finding those.

1:26:11.170 --> 1:26:12.060
- I'm just going to assume that they're

1:26:12.060 --> 1:26:15.100
at the house you came
out of a few hours ago.

1:26:15.100 --> 1:26:17.850
Oh, and I imagine that's
where your friends are, right?

1:26:18.890 --> 1:26:20.440
(gun clicks)

1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:21.273
- Shit!

1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:24.520
Look, you lay one finger on them.

1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:27.260
I will haunt your life
forever and make it miserable.

1:26:27.260 --> 1:26:28.470
- That's already what I'm doing to you,

1:26:28.470 --> 1:26:30.273
so any other ideas?

1:26:32.380 --> 1:26:33.408
- Damn it!

1:26:33.408 --> 1:26:36.158
(dramatic music)

1:26:39.391 --> 1:26:40.808
What have I done?

1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:45.623
- Shit, shit, shit!

1:26:49.679 --> 1:26:51.096
Come on, come on.

1:26:54.422 --> 1:26:57.255
- Damn it Jacob, you have a key.

1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:00.930
Corben, what the hell are you doing here?

1:27:00.930 --> 1:27:02.680
- I'll explain in the car, where's Davis?

1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:03.513
- He's asleep.

1:27:03.513 --> 1:27:04.700
- Go get him, I'll meet
you in the car, hurry.

1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:05.550
- [Michael] Cool.

1:27:07.350 --> 1:27:08.440
- [Corben] So what I thought Ava

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:10.780
was saying about Jacob
this whole time is true,

1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:12.980
that's why I've been
staying away from you guys.

1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:14.510
She also wanted me to kill him

1:27:14.510 --> 1:27:16.770
and then you guys, she's gone insane.

1:27:16.770 --> 1:27:18.320
- [Davis] Dang, where are they now?

1:27:19.260 --> 1:27:20.980
- This place just down the road from here,

1:27:20.980 --> 1:27:22.093
like two minutes away.

1:27:23.830 --> 1:27:26.770
Not much, but when I left, it
was getting really intense.

1:27:26.770 --> 1:27:28.853
Ava was holding a gun close by her side.

1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:32.060
It's not good.

1:27:32.060 --> 1:27:33.988
- [Davis] She's a monster.

1:27:33.988 --> 1:27:36.738
(dramatic music)

1:27:41.890 --> 1:27:42.723
- [Ava] Perfect.

1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:46.113
Trees, rocks, leaves, and docks.

1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:50.896
This has gotta be outside somewhere.

1:27:50.896 --> 1:27:53.729
(dramatic music)

1:27:58.420 --> 1:28:03.420
(engine rumbles)
(dramatic music)

1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:10.143
So long humanity.

1:28:11.032 --> 1:28:13.782
(dramatic music)

1:28:31.470 --> 1:28:34.310
- Guys, I'm not asking for much, but

1:28:34.310 --> 1:28:37.533
promise me you'll bring
humanity back, please.

1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:40.890
- [Corben] Jacob!

1:28:40.890 --> 1:28:41.723
- Corben?

1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:44.460
- [Corben] Jacob!

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:46.920
- Corben, hey, I'm still
in here, Ava's gone!

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:48.600
Guys, it's Ava.

1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:50.450
- We know, Corben told us
everything along the way.

1:28:50.450 --> 1:28:51.283
- Where's Ava?

1:28:51.283 --> 1:28:52.780
- [Jacob] She said she
was getting the envelopes.

1:28:52.780 --> 1:28:55.230
- Shit, Davis, did you get the envelopes?

1:28:55.230 --> 1:28:56.600
- No, we were in such a hurry.

1:28:56.600 --> 1:28:59.680
But she doesn't even know
where they are, does she?

1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:01.380
- Well when she left, she said she saw me

1:29:01.380 --> 1:29:03.930
going out of the house that they're in.

1:29:03.930 --> 1:29:05.100
- [Davis] We have to go after her.

1:29:05.100 --> 1:29:06.750
- Davis, Ava is dangerous.

1:29:06.750 --> 1:29:08.020
- [Davis] We don't have a choice,

1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:09.610
she's going to destroy them.

1:29:09.610 --> 1:29:11.070
- Michael, think of the greater good,

1:29:11.070 --> 1:29:13.090
do we risk our lives to save humanity,

1:29:13.090 --> 1:29:14.180
or do we just go extinct?

1:29:14.180 --> 1:29:15.970
If we don't play our cards correctly,

1:29:15.970 --> 1:29:17.520
humans may never live again.

1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:19.780
- [Jacob] Yeah, trust us
Michael, it's four on one.

1:29:19.780 --> 1:29:21.240
There shouldn't be any issues.

1:29:21.240 --> 1:29:22.750
- Unless she has four bullets.

1:29:22.750 --> 1:29:23.583
- Let's go.

1:29:27.801 --> 1:29:29.700
- Now remember guys, stay quiet.

1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:34.270
- Nothing.

1:29:34.270 --> 1:29:35.103
- [Michael] Damn it.

1:29:35.103 --> 1:29:35.936
- [Jacob] Shit.

1:29:37.870 --> 1:29:39.720
- She's already out there then.

1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:40.740
We need to go out there

1:29:40.740 --> 1:29:42.842
and find the other
envelopes before she does.

1:29:42.842 --> 1:29:45.592
(dramatic music)

1:29:52.010 --> 1:29:53.890
- [Davis] That last clue had docks in it.

1:29:53.890 --> 1:29:55.670
It has to be a place by the lake.

1:29:55.670 --> 1:29:56.940
- [Michael] What about that
place we used to go to,

1:29:56.940 --> 1:29:58.373
like five or ten years ago?

1:30:00.105 --> 1:30:00.938
The one by the creek?

1:30:00.938 --> 1:30:02.640
- I remember that one, yeah.

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:04.290
It matches the description
we got from the envelopes.

1:30:04.290 --> 1:30:05.160
- Is it close?

1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:06.220
- A few minutes.

1:30:06.220 --> 1:30:07.170
- [Michael] All right, let's go there.

1:30:07.170 --> 1:30:11.820
- All right, we should make
a plan in case we see Ava.

1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:15.320
Okay, one person can go
search for the other envelope,

1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:19.280
one can search the car
for the other envelopes

1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:23.020
that Ava took, and then the last one,

1:30:23.020 --> 1:30:26.270
the last two of us, we can
go find Ava and confront her.

1:30:26.270 --> 1:30:27.103
- [Jacob] Good idea.

1:30:27.103 --> 1:30:30.543
- All right, remember, stay quiet.

1:30:49.414 --> 1:30:51.011
- Remember, stay quiet.

1:30:51.011 --> 1:30:51.844
- Yeah.

1:30:52.753 --> 1:30:55.086
- Keep your eye out for Ava.

1:31:07.748 --> 1:31:12.748
(wind whistling)
(dramatic music)

1:31:20.698 --> 1:31:23.448
(dramatic music)

1:31:37.174 --> 1:31:38.413
- We just have to keep looking.

1:31:40.230 --> 1:31:41.730
- Looking for what?

1:31:41.730 --> 1:31:42.710
- Found her.

1:31:42.710 --> 1:31:43.543
- Guys, get over here!

1:31:45.493 --> 1:31:47.251
- You aren't going to win this Jacob,

1:31:47.251 --> 1:31:48.691
no matter how hard you try.

1:31:49.610 --> 1:31:51.523
- Oh, look who it is.

1:31:51.523 --> 1:31:53.143
- Look Ava, we found the next envelope,

1:31:53.143 --> 1:31:55.363
we have the clue for
the next two after that.

1:31:55.363 --> 1:31:57.170
Then we're gonna save humanity,

1:31:57.170 --> 1:31:59.170
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1:32:00.500 --> 1:32:01.513
Where are you going?

1:32:03.050 --> 1:32:06.073
- You forgot one key
piece, you always do Jacob.

1:32:07.474 --> 1:32:08.920
- [Jacob] What does that mean?

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:11.413
- You need all 26 envelopes
to crack the code.

1:32:12.349 --> 1:32:13.182
- [Jacob] Crap.

1:32:13.182 --> 1:32:14.015
- [Michael] No, no,
let her go, let her go.

1:32:14.015 --> 1:32:15.612
- She has the envelopes!

1:32:15.612 --> 1:32:18.362
(dramatic music)

1:32:22.180 --> 1:32:23.276
- [Corben] Let's get out of here.

1:32:23.276 --> 1:32:26.026
(dramatic music)

1:33:06.156 --> 1:33:09.606
- Guys, this envelope's
thicker than the rest of them.

1:33:09.606 --> 1:33:11.180
- Well the previous ones
didn't have anything in them,

1:33:11.180 --> 1:33:13.610
so that seems entirely possible.

1:33:13.610 --> 1:33:14.443
- [Davis] You know what I mean.

1:33:14.443 --> 1:33:16.373
- Better not be a novel, I'm
never going to read that.

1:33:19.540 --> 1:33:22.320
- Guys, these are the Y and Z.

1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:25.230
The last two envelopes, we have all 26.

1:33:25.230 --> 1:33:26.820
Do you want that means?

1:33:26.820 --> 1:33:28.220
We can crack the code.

1:33:28.220 --> 1:33:30.070
- [Corben] Is there any writing in X?

1:33:32.300 --> 1:33:34.440
- No, just the last two envelopes.

1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:35.273
Y says,

1:33:41.048 --> 1:33:42.931
"You are very close to the last envelope.

1:33:42.931 --> 1:33:46.720
Now go downtown, at the top
floor of the tallest building,

1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:48.903
you will find the final envelope Z.

1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:53.860
It will have your final
instructions on cracking this code.

1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:56.133
To bring humans back to this planet."

1:33:58.007 --> 1:33:59.583
And this one is for you.

1:34:08.350 --> 1:34:12.038
- The last one just says, "Thank you."

1:34:12.038 --> 1:34:13.721
(dramatic music)

1:34:13.721 --> 1:34:18.721
(people chattering)
(birds chirping)

1:34:27.478 --> 1:34:30.228
(dramatic music)

1:36:34.780 --> 1:36:37.613
(dramatic music)
