WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:03.990
Is your name Matilda Webber?

00:03.992 --> 00:07.368
Oh, you've really lost
your mind this time, Taylor.

00:07.370 --> 00:10.438
Is your code name
"Titan", head of Codex?

00:10.440 --> 00:12.678
Are you seriously asking me

00:12.680 --> 00:15.616
if I'm the leader of a
global terrorist organization?

00:17.380 --> 00:20.049
Is this you?

00:22.172 --> 00:24.462
Russ, why don't we just
go back to the war room

00:24.464 --> 00:25.523
and talk this out together?

00:25.525 --> 00:27.064
Well, she hasn't answered
the question, has she?

00:27.066 --> 00:28.413
- It's Matty.
- You know what, Mac?

00:28.415 --> 00:29.524
I think you should leave.

00:29.526 --> 00:31.659
I'd like to talk to Taylor alone.

00:31.661 --> 00:33.929
Turn off the comms.

00:34.931 --> 00:37.399
Yes, ma'am.

00:40.303 --> 00:42.237
- You want the truth?
- Yes.

00:43.940 --> 00:46.172
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

00:46.174 --> 00:48.126
But please tell me you
found a lead with that photo.

00:48.128 --> 00:50.444
I'm operating under the
assumption it's a deepfake.

00:50.446 --> 00:52.602
But I can't get any
original footage because

00:52.604 --> 00:54.648
the soccer stadium
servers were wiped clean.

00:54.650 --> 00:55.837
What about the DARPA guys

00:55.839 --> 00:57.296
who ran the facial analytics software?

00:57.298 --> 00:59.288
I've been running forensics on
them since they sent them over.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.323
- It checks out. You know what?
- Well, what about...

01:01.325 --> 01:03.158
Nobody talk to me right now.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.547
Please.

01:04.549 --> 01:06.138
Now, you listen to me,

01:06.140 --> 01:09.131
you manipulative,
insignificant psyops fool.

01:09.133 --> 01:11.923
I'm not gonna let your sick
paranoia tear this team apart.

01:11.925 --> 01:13.815
Codex has its hooks in everywhere.

01:13.817 --> 01:16.674
I imagine its ideology
is quite persuasive.

01:16.676 --> 01:18.199
There's nothing more dangerous than

01:18.201 --> 01:20.858
people who do the wrong
things for the right reasons.

01:20.860 --> 01:24.312
Did being a war profiteer
all those years mess you up?

01:24.314 --> 01:26.403
Or were you already messed up,

01:26.405 --> 01:28.607
which is why you became a war profiteer?

01:30.732 --> 01:33.289
- Maybe we should hear this.
- Why? You think she's lying?

01:33.291 --> 01:35.948
If Matty is the head of Codex,
don't we have the right to know?

01:35.950 --> 01:37.539
Press that button, you're
doubting her loyalty,

01:37.541 --> 01:40.167
- and there's no going back.
- Well, I think we're already there.

01:41.428 --> 01:43.104
Hang on a second.

01:43.106 --> 01:45.229
What are these keystrokes?

01:45.231 --> 01:46.721
I might be exhausted,

01:46.723 --> 01:48.657
but this doesn't look
like English, right?

01:49.806 --> 01:51.973
I think those are Estonian.

01:52.773 --> 01:54.496
That's it.

01:54.498 --> 01:55.620
Are you Titan?

01:55.622 --> 01:57.578
Are you the head of Codex?

01:57.580 --> 01:58.936
Riley!

01:58.938 --> 02:01.662
The Phoenix server log.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.193
Someone accessed our files

02:03.195 --> 02:04.728
using an Estonian language keyboard.

02:04.730 --> 02:06.163
- Meaning?
- We were hacked.

02:06.165 --> 02:08.354
That photo you sent to DARPA
for analysis, that was fake.

02:08.357 --> 02:10.814
It was a plant. This? It's fake.

02:10.816 --> 02:13.406
Someone got to our
footage before we did.

02:13.408 --> 02:15.376
Matty's clean.

02:28.187 --> 02:29.315
Matty,

02:29.317 --> 02:32.456
- we're sorry...
- Don't.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.193
Codex tried to get us
to turn on each other.

02:39.098 --> 02:41.132
I'd say it worked.

02:48.163 --> 02:51.163
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

03:17.870 --> 03:19.803
Sorry.

03:19.805 --> 03:21.638
Can't sleep?

03:21.640 --> 03:24.309
No. Not really. I got a lot on my mind.

03:31.583 --> 03:34.018
You mean other than the Matty situation.

03:35.387 --> 03:37.654
You and Desi had a rather intimate snog

03:37.656 --> 03:40.123
on the Jumbotron in
front of a stadium crowd.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.926
It's fair game to ask.
Are you rekindled?

03:42.928 --> 03:46.697
We agreed to have a conversation
about us and where we stood

03:46.699 --> 03:49.933
and keep finding excuses not
to have that conversation.

03:49.935 --> 03:52.202
- So, you're avoiding it.
- Avoiding what?

03:52.204 --> 03:55.172
These peanuts are great. Zero trans fat.

04:01.013 --> 04:03.280
Oh, that message is more
than eight hours old.

04:03.282 --> 04:06.049
Remind me to upgrade the comms
when we get back, would you?

04:06.051 --> 04:09.721
Russ. Russ.

04:11.056 --> 04:12.356
I know it's been forever,

04:12.358 --> 04:14.591
but I don't have a lot of
time and I'm in trouble.

04:14.593 --> 04:17.594
Everything that happened,
please just forgive and forget.

04:17.596 --> 04:19.396
Get here as fast as you
can. I need your help.

04:27.290 --> 04:29.213
Is there any more?

04:29.215 --> 04:30.782
Um, no.

04:32.644 --> 04:34.044
No.

04:34.046 --> 04:35.245
Where are you going?

04:35.247 --> 04:36.814
I'm diverting this plane.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.342
We'll stabilize for medevac.
How long you been

04:41.344 --> 04:42.642
- doing chest compressions?
- Is he gonna make it?

04:42.644 --> 04:44.454
Two hours, and I'm getting
one hell of a leg cramp.

04:44.456 --> 04:45.545
Is he gonna make it?

04:45.547 --> 04:47.124
As soon as we're in there,
I'm handing him off to you.

04:47.126 --> 04:48.766
Copy that.

04:51.897 --> 04:54.064
- That's my man in there.
- You're wearing a gun.

04:54.066 --> 04:56.066
I just want to know,
is he gonna make it?

04:56.068 --> 04:57.534
No guns in my clinic.

04:57.536 --> 04:58.702
Surrender it or leave.

04:58.704 --> 05:01.439
He's my responsibility. He has family.

05:01.441 --> 05:02.696
He lost a lot of blood.

05:02.698 --> 05:03.807
The bullet tore through his abdomen.

05:03.809 --> 05:06.027
I am so sick of guns, I could scream!

05:06.029 --> 05:07.334
Scream at Red Order, not me.

05:07.336 --> 05:08.602
I'm the one who's protecting this place.

05:08.604 --> 05:10.684
Correction. Your company is being paid

05:10.686 --> 05:11.915
to protect the pumping station.

05:11.917 --> 05:13.173
Don't pretend like you're a hero.

05:13.175 --> 05:14.648
Spearhead? Rebels?

05:14.650 --> 05:16.157
- You men are all the same.
- Take that back.

05:16.159 --> 05:17.921
- Take off your gun.
- Oh, sure.

05:17.923 --> 05:19.156
So I'll just go outside

05:19.158 --> 05:20.824
and sing "Kumbaya" to
the rebels, shall I?

05:20.826 --> 05:22.559
They'll lay down their
weapons, leave town,

05:22.561 --> 05:25.095
and we all live happily
ever after! Simple!

05:25.097 --> 05:27.164
Is that what you think of me?

05:27.166 --> 05:28.765
- Simple?
- No.

05:28.767 --> 05:32.769
I think you are frustrating and naive

05:32.771 --> 05:36.061
and unfortunately the
best person I've ever met.

05:36.063 --> 05:37.931
Well, you're selfish and rude...

05:43.315 --> 05:44.848
I'm going to say something to you

05:44.850 --> 05:47.185
that I've never said to
another woman in my life.

05:49.021 --> 05:51.288
You can take my gun.

06:03.635 --> 06:04.968
Russ.

06:04.970 --> 06:06.069
We got your back,

06:06.071 --> 06:07.871
but we're still a little
light on the details.

06:07.873 --> 06:10.173
You all saw the message.
What else do you need to know?

06:10.175 --> 06:11.676
- Who is this woman?
- She's a friend.

06:13.278 --> 06:15.979
We haven't seen each other for a while.

06:15.981 --> 06:18.148
Until last night,
when I got the message.

06:18.150 --> 06:19.883
Where the hell are we?

06:19.885 --> 06:21.685
Just outside Revaca.

06:21.687 --> 06:22.886
It's one of the smallest

06:22.888 --> 06:24.888
and poorest towns in Moldova.

06:24.890 --> 06:27.414
There's no local law
enforcement, which is why

06:27.416 --> 06:29.349
the Russian-backed separatist
rebels used to come in

06:29.351 --> 06:30.606
and terrorize the locals

06:30.608 --> 06:32.698
in their ongoing conflict with Ukraine.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.390
Used to?

06:34.392 --> 06:36.248
My company had a contract

06:36.250 --> 06:38.535
to secure the oil pumping
station from the rebels.

06:38.537 --> 06:40.203
We did our job

06:40.205 --> 06:42.706
and left.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.709
And it's been quiet ever since.

06:56.782 --> 06:58.115
Quiet was an understatement.

06:58.117 --> 07:01.151
Well, I know the clinic's around
here somewhere. Stay frosty.

07:01.153 --> 07:03.154
I just hope we're not too late.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.530
That factory is the only
place with any signs of life.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.666
You smell that ammonia?

07:15.668 --> 07:17.334
They must be making textiles,

07:17.336 --> 07:19.436
but normally a factory
would filter out the odor.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.138
Should never be that potent.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.168
It was never Paris,
but Emilia was committed

07:23.170 --> 07:24.492
to making this a better place,

07:24.494 --> 07:27.111
bringing in a full-time
clinic, more jobs.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.789
Sorry to say, but it
looks like she failed.

07:29.791 --> 07:30.951
It's very unlike her.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.886
Those are untreated chemical burns.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.422
There it is.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.168
Emilia?

07:58.077 --> 07:59.844
Emilia?

08:14.237 --> 08:15.985
- Who are you?
- Russ Taylor.

08:15.987 --> 08:18.262
Emilia messaged me last
night. Where is she?

08:18.264 --> 08:20.197
Did you say Taylor?

08:20.199 --> 08:23.000
You have three seconds before
you become a stain on that wall.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.243
Easy now.

08:24.245 --> 08:27.285
Two... one...

08:27.287 --> 08:29.021
Emilia was kidnapped.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.077
Kidnapped?

08:33.078 --> 08:34.477
Kidnapped by who?

08:34.480 --> 08:36.114
I don't know.

08:38.884 --> 08:40.017
Who the hell are you?

08:40.019 --> 08:42.152
I'm her husband.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.594
Um, I'm sorry, um...

08:45.596 --> 08:47.119
Emilia and I...

08:47.121 --> 08:48.559
I know who you are.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.027
You do?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.897
You're the man who destroyed this town.

09:05.041 --> 09:08.054
Russ, the Red Order
is stepping up their attacks.

09:08.056 --> 09:10.291
One day, it's going to be you.

09:12.646 --> 09:14.580
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, it's not mine.

09:14.582 --> 09:15.763
Not mine.

09:15.765 --> 09:17.057
- Come on!
- Get him on a gurney.

09:17.059 --> 09:18.331
What happened?

09:18.333 --> 09:20.604
Spearhead limey bastard shot me.

09:20.606 --> 09:23.236
Yeah, you shot first. I didn't miss.

09:23.238 --> 09:24.704
He's Red Order.

09:24.706 --> 09:26.706
- They shot at the pumping station.
- Did your boys

09:26.708 --> 09:28.785
take down any civilians
with your target practice?

09:28.787 --> 09:30.110
I need that one alive.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.613
Yeah, well, it's kind
of what we do here.

09:41.356 --> 09:42.690
Hey.

09:44.860 --> 09:46.359
The bleeding's stopped.

09:46.361 --> 09:48.629
Pumping him full of antibiotics.

09:50.699 --> 09:52.432
He's gonna make it.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.937
You're not half bad at this.

09:56.939 --> 09:59.774
I'm getting too much practice.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.978
Hey.

10:05.714 --> 10:07.347
Why are you crying?

10:07.349 --> 10:09.182
Shut up.

10:09.184 --> 10:11.518
I'm relieving stress.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.757
Did you have to shoot him?

10:17.759 --> 10:20.828
Why would you ask me that?

10:24.132 --> 10:26.133
I want to understand.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.403
I think it's better you don't.

10:30.405 --> 10:33.274
Tell me you're going to stop them.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.317
What did the kidnappers look like?

10:44.319 --> 10:46.152
I wasn't at home.

10:46.154 --> 10:47.354
I have no idea.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.055
Has there been a ransom demand?

10:49.057 --> 10:51.157
If it's money they're
after, I can arrange it.

10:51.159 --> 10:52.492
Course you can.

10:52.494 --> 10:54.915
Isn't that your solution
to every problem?

10:54.917 --> 10:56.596
Yes. Do you want to know why?

10:56.598 --> 10:57.797
Because despite

10:57.799 --> 10:59.900
what cynics say, money does in fact

10:59.902 --> 11:02.969
solve most problems,
especially kidnappings.

11:02.971 --> 11:05.338
- I don't want your kind of help.
- So you're willing to let

11:05.340 --> 11:07.340
the kidnappers hold on to
your wife because, what?

11:07.342 --> 11:09.009
You don't like the way I do business.

11:09.011 --> 11:11.978
Your business is blood money.

11:11.980 --> 11:14.447
And after what you've done to Revaca,

11:14.449 --> 11:16.686
you're the last man to help anybody.

11:16.688 --> 11:19.219
This town wouldn't be
here if it weren't for me.

11:19.221 --> 11:22.206
Do you have any idea
of how many people died

11:22.208 --> 11:23.742
because of you?

11:25.360 --> 11:26.493
That's enough.

11:26.495 --> 11:28.662
I don't know why Emilia called you,

11:28.664 --> 11:30.631
but you need to leave.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.200
Now!

11:41.343 --> 11:43.706
Russ, stop.

11:43.708 --> 11:44.711
What was that about?

11:44.713 --> 11:46.913
What did he mean, people
died because of you?

11:46.915 --> 11:49.082
That's none of your concern right now.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.684
Uh, I'd say it is.

11:50.686 --> 11:52.469
What are you getting us into, man?

11:52.471 --> 11:56.656
May I remind you that I own the Phoenix?

11:56.658 --> 11:58.391
I bought it.

11:58.393 --> 12:01.061
Therefore, if I say we are going
to rescue a kidnapped woman,

12:01.063 --> 12:02.462
we are going to rescue
a kidnapped woman.

12:02.464 --> 12:03.496
That's it. End of story.

12:03.498 --> 12:04.998
Your boss has spoken.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.600
Yeah, well, that's not
exactly how we work.

12:06.602 --> 12:08.868
Not how you work? Not how you work?

12:08.870 --> 12:11.338
My God, what kind of codependent

12:11.340 --> 12:13.773
sandbox did Matty raise you all in?!

12:13.775 --> 12:15.575
The real world isn't a fantasy land

12:15.577 --> 12:16.943
of mutual respect and trust.

12:16.945 --> 12:20.413
The real world is a place
where people are complicated

12:20.415 --> 12:22.014
and disappointing.

12:22.016 --> 12:23.205
And some of us

12:23.207 --> 12:25.942
have actually made mistakes in life.

12:32.243 --> 12:34.133
Something weird definitely happened

12:34.135 --> 12:35.395
five years ago when he was here.

12:35.397 --> 12:37.664
- Can you look up his old PMC?
- Way ahead of you.

12:37.666 --> 12:39.032
Already have.

12:39.034 --> 12:41.635
His contracts are classified,
but I did some digging,

12:41.637 --> 12:43.504
and I got access to Spearhead's files.

12:45.107 --> 12:46.908
Thanks. "Spearhead Operations

12:46.910 --> 12:48.973
was hired by the Ukrainian oil company

12:48.975 --> 12:52.411
to fight off the Red Order", and then...

12:53.915 --> 12:56.916
And then after three
months of heavy fighting,

12:56.918 --> 12:59.452
the rebels just up and
went; they disappeared.

12:59.454 --> 13:02.125
Spearhead got a bonus,
Taylor moved on, that's it.

13:02.127 --> 13:03.283
That's all there is.

13:03.285 --> 13:05.358
Russ probably wrote this report.

13:15.470 --> 13:18.505
If you want to find
Emilia, we need better intel.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.640
Victor's the closest thing that we have

13:20.642 --> 13:22.842
to an eyewitness, and he's
not exactly talking right now.

13:22.844 --> 13:27.547
Well, the State Department
keeps, uh, files on kidnappings

13:27.549 --> 13:30.217
and ransom activities;
maybe there's a lead there.

13:31.086 --> 13:33.853
All right, I'm in the embassy files now.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.222
Not seeing anything
about kidnappings, though.

13:36.224 --> 13:39.359
But they did flag a high
volume of semitrailer trucks

13:39.361 --> 13:40.860
exiting Revaca twice a week.

13:40.862 --> 13:41.981
Why is that suspicious?

13:41.983 --> 13:44.130
Because they crossed the border
into Ukraine using back roads,

13:44.132 --> 13:46.485
bypassing mandatory checkpoints.

13:46.487 --> 13:47.634
Smuggling.

13:47.636 --> 13:51.069
Well, if Emilia did come
across some illegal operation,

13:51.071 --> 13:52.429
she'd definitely take
a stand against it.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.606
Well, that could be
what got her kidnapped.

13:53.608 --> 13:54.674
Where are the trucks coming from?

13:54.676 --> 13:57.111
The factory.

13:58.213 --> 14:01.147
It's very likely Emilia's there, too.

14:09.624 --> 14:12.192
Sure is a lot of
guards for a textile factory.

14:12.194 --> 14:13.693
Yeah, I don't think they're making

14:13.695 --> 14:15.096
"I heart Revaca" T-shirts in there.

14:16.662 --> 14:20.133
- They're Red Order.
- The same rebels you ran out of town

14:20.135 --> 14:21.234
five years ago?

14:21.236 --> 14:22.469
So you checked up on me.

14:22.471 --> 14:25.171
That's good. It's what
I would have done, too.

14:25.173 --> 14:27.407
You don't seem surprised
that they're here.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.842
Oh, I had my suspicions.

14:28.844 --> 14:31.978
All right, we should
check round the back.

14:31.980 --> 14:33.880
Yeah.

14:33.882 --> 14:35.548
We're doing this for Emilia,

14:35.550 --> 14:37.584
and then you and I are
gonna have a conversation.

14:37.586 --> 14:38.652
Oh, goody.

14:55.837 --> 14:58.338
One bolted steel door and two

14:58.340 --> 15:00.240
sealed lead glass windows.

15:00.242 --> 15:02.009
Explains why there's no guards around.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.278
Looks like a storeroom.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.580
Russ, you have a lighter?

15:07.582 --> 15:10.083
Yep. Coming at you.

15:10.085 --> 15:12.366
Think we're gonna go
straight through that window.

15:15.157 --> 15:18.925
A plunger would be better,
but glass jars will do.

15:18.927 --> 15:21.617
The fire inside the jars uses up oxygen

15:21.619 --> 15:23.509
and creates the negative pressure,

15:23.511 --> 15:25.103
also known as suction.

15:25.105 --> 15:28.401
And this chemical foam
will act as an adhesive,

15:28.403 --> 15:30.637
so that when we break the glass...

15:30.639 --> 15:32.072
Quiet as a mouse.

15:56.972 --> 16:00.159
That smell is ANFO...
ammonium nitrate fuel oil.

16:00.161 --> 16:02.869
It's simple but dangerously volatile.

16:02.871 --> 16:04.404
That explains the burns.

16:04.406 --> 16:06.126
They don't know how to
handle the chemicals.

16:08.153 --> 16:10.021
This is an IED factory.

16:13.949 --> 16:17.317
Looks like Emilia's
husband decided to join the party.

16:17.319 --> 16:20.153
Bastard's working for them.

16:20.155 --> 16:22.323
Emilia must have found out.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.228
Check out the boss.

16:37.589 --> 16:39.761
_

16:39.763 --> 16:42.585
_

16:42.587 --> 16:44.587
_

17:08.136 --> 17:09.502
That's Anton.

17:09.503 --> 17:10.704
You know that guy?

17:14.476 --> 17:16.675
Russ Taylor.

17:16.678 --> 17:18.344
Back to shoot me again?

17:18.346 --> 17:20.781
I just want to talk.

17:25.371 --> 17:27.338
You have 30 seconds.

17:28.990 --> 17:31.724
I was hired to protect
the pumping station.

17:31.726 --> 17:33.593
You see?

17:33.595 --> 17:37.363
And I suspect that for the right price,

17:37.365 --> 17:39.445
a practical man such as yourself

17:39.447 --> 17:41.701
will leave it alone.

17:41.703 --> 17:44.571
You go your way, a little richer...

17:45.707 --> 17:48.708
... and I go mine.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.711
How does that sound to you?

18:03.425 --> 18:06.026
Like we speak the same language.

18:11.032 --> 18:13.570
I made him.

18:13.572 --> 18:15.206
This is all my fault.

18:23.761 --> 18:25.294
You were in there?

18:25.296 --> 18:27.186
Did you see what you've done?

18:27.188 --> 18:29.323
Says a willing participant
in their slave labor.

18:30.646 --> 18:32.147
No. It's all right.

18:32.985 --> 18:34.451
You think I want this?

18:34.453 --> 18:36.219
It's been hell since they came back.

18:36.221 --> 18:37.821
I'm trying to keep everyone alive!

18:37.823 --> 18:39.143
Well, you're doing a bang-up job.

18:41.857 --> 18:45.562
They took my wife. My Emilia.

18:49.726 --> 18:52.068
Your Emilia.

18:52.070 --> 18:53.304
Russ.

18:54.573 --> 18:56.040
Russ.

18:59.478 --> 19:01.978
Well, if we're gonna
get her back, then...

19:01.980 --> 19:05.483
maybe we should start
helping each other, yeah?

19:09.288 --> 19:11.121
Emilia discovered

19:11.123 --> 19:13.456
they were transporting
the bombs into Ukraine.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.158
She wanted to alert the U.N.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.260
Well, that makes sense.
The U.N. has the authority

19:17.262 --> 19:18.461
to shut the whole thing down.

19:18.463 --> 19:19.963
So why'd they kidnap her,

19:19.965 --> 19:22.365
instead of... you know.

19:22.367 --> 19:25.702
She's leverage. To make sure
I keep the factory running.

19:25.704 --> 19:28.338
Anton's holding her in a
compound just outside of town.

19:28.340 --> 19:29.706
Well, that's where we're going.

19:29.708 --> 19:32.342
Oh, great. So it's the four
of us against an armed militia.

19:32.344 --> 19:33.643
Yeah. Must be a Tuesday.

19:33.645 --> 19:35.712
I'll give you whatever you want.

19:35.714 --> 19:37.814
This has gone on too long.

19:37.816 --> 19:39.483
This is our home.

19:45.357 --> 19:47.624
We got Victor's
description of the compound.

19:47.626 --> 19:49.182
And since Anton will remember me

19:49.184 --> 19:51.027
as the man who laced
his palm with silver,

19:51.029 --> 19:52.529
that should get us
through the front door.

19:52.531 --> 19:54.764
Sounds like a hell of a deal.

19:54.766 --> 19:57.216
All right, let's just get this
out in the open, shall we?

19:57.218 --> 19:58.425
You can judge me however you like.

19:58.427 --> 20:00.036
It was a complicated situation,

20:00.038 --> 20:01.438
and I did it for the right reasons.

20:04.076 --> 20:06.509
We get in, we get Emilia...

20:06.511 --> 20:09.346
And proof of Anton's weapons sales.

20:09.348 --> 20:11.349
And then we get the hell out.

20:22.994 --> 20:25.762
Russ Taylor, Spearhead Operations.

20:25.764 --> 20:28.366
Be a lamb, tell Anton
I'm here, would you?

20:30.681 --> 20:34.504
_

20:50.555 --> 20:53.891
Looks like Scarface
and a pirate had a baby.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.550
Russ Taylor.

21:03.552 --> 21:07.910
If I remember correctly,
you're a terrible guest.

21:07.912 --> 21:09.268
You like to shoot people.

21:09.270 --> 21:10.793
Well, I don't like to.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.879
This is a far cry from
the, uh, tent in the woods.

21:15.881 --> 21:18.515
You've done very well.

21:18.517 --> 21:21.618
I'm an excellent businessman.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.888
- You're my inspiration.
- Hmm.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.291
You have something I want.

21:30.495 --> 21:31.863
From what I heard,

21:31.865 --> 21:34.489
you left Spearhead and
shut the company down.

21:34.491 --> 21:37.868
I had to shed my skin to get
under the U.S. government radar,

21:37.870 --> 21:39.969
but right now...

21:41.006 --> 21:42.206
... I need a favor.

21:44.539 --> 21:46.061
A supply of IEDs

21:46.063 --> 21:48.131
from a source who knows
how to keep a secret.

21:52.684 --> 21:54.350
I don't owe you any favors.

21:54.352 --> 21:56.086
I'd say you owe me everything.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.349
But that doesn't mean you can't charge

22:00.351 --> 22:02.125
a fair price for your product.

22:02.127 --> 22:03.960
You won't find the price fair,

22:03.962 --> 22:05.829
but you'll pay it.

22:05.831 --> 22:09.065
I'll get you the Swiss
bank account numbers.

22:09.067 --> 22:10.433
Oh, I'm so sorry.

22:10.435 --> 22:12.025
My, uh, my colleague here is bleeding

22:12.027 --> 22:13.436
all over your beautiful home.

22:13.438 --> 22:15.104
What happened to you?

22:15.106 --> 22:17.340
We were under fire crossing
the border. I got hit.

22:17.342 --> 22:18.675
She needs a doctor.

22:18.677 --> 22:20.076
They said in Revaca that the, uh,

22:20.078 --> 22:21.177
clinic doctor's here with you.

22:21.179 --> 22:23.066
- Is that right?
- And?

22:23.068 --> 22:25.114
Well, she can continue to
bleed all over your floor,

22:25.116 --> 22:28.018
or, for 5,000 euros, you can...

22:28.020 --> 22:30.154
you can let her see a doctor.

22:34.532 --> 22:36.054
Take them.

22:36.056 --> 22:37.624
Then you leave.

22:52.377 --> 22:53.711
Who are you?

22:56.982 --> 22:59.717
You're here.

23:06.958 --> 23:09.559
Someone's in a good mood.

23:17.706 --> 23:19.874
I do have some good news for you.

23:23.174 --> 23:26.209
Spearhead's job here is done,

23:26.211 --> 23:28.546
and I'm leaving.

23:30.048 --> 23:31.948
How is that good news?

23:31.950 --> 23:35.451
Well, it is if you come with me.

23:35.453 --> 23:37.954
But my work isn't done.

23:37.956 --> 23:40.723
But they can send someone else.

23:40.725 --> 23:42.792
I thought you wanted
this. I thought you...

23:42.794 --> 23:46.138
thought you were tired of the
soldiers and the bullet wounds.

23:46.140 --> 23:48.565
I don't understand. What
happened to the Red Order?

23:48.567 --> 23:50.934
- I took care of it.
- What did you do?

23:50.936 --> 23:52.769
I put an end to the fighting.

23:52.771 --> 23:55.271
I got them to leave.

23:55.273 --> 23:56.941
With a little cash incentive.

23:58.710 --> 24:00.209
You paid them off?

24:00.211 --> 24:03.613
Russ, these men are violent terrorists.

24:03.615 --> 24:05.048
That's not a solution.

24:05.050 --> 24:07.817
It is the right solution for right now.

24:07.819 --> 24:09.619
Look, we can leave this horrible place.

24:09.621 --> 24:11.077
We can go and live the lives we deserve,

24:11.079 --> 24:12.655
the life that you deserve.

24:12.657 --> 24:16.860
How does Bali sound...

24:20.198 --> 24:22.032
... for the honeymoon?

24:25.337 --> 24:27.438
Russ, get up.

24:30.775 --> 24:32.609
I did this for you.

24:32.611 --> 24:34.878
Get up.

24:38.850 --> 24:40.851
That's not who I am.

24:42.921 --> 24:45.255
And not who I thought you were, either.

24:54.065 --> 24:56.699
Thank you for coming.

24:56.701 --> 24:58.840
There's bad news.

24:58.842 --> 25:01.270
I'm not the only hostage Anton has.

25:01.272 --> 25:02.805
There are five others.

25:02.807 --> 25:05.503
I came for you. After
we get you to safety

25:05.505 --> 25:06.972
- and deal with Anton, then we can...
- No.

25:06.974 --> 25:08.411
I don't go unless they do.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.005
This is not a negotiation.

25:10.007 --> 25:13.883
If you take me, Anton will
kill the other hostages.

25:13.885 --> 25:17.353
Do you want more people to die?

25:17.355 --> 25:19.222
Desi's all patched up.

25:19.224 --> 25:21.691
And Riley hacked into Anton's records.

25:21.693 --> 25:24.060
We have all the evidence
we need for the U.N.

25:24.062 --> 25:27.264
I'm not leaving without the others.

25:29.023 --> 25:30.023
New plan.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.548
Are you quite sure about this plan?

25:42.550 --> 25:44.491
Because, spoiler alert, I'm not.

25:44.493 --> 25:46.193
All right, first things
first. Emilia said that

25:46.195 --> 25:48.195
she and the other
hostages are being kept

25:48.197 --> 25:49.663
in a barracks tent behind this wall.

25:49.665 --> 25:51.365
You left out the part
about how we're getting

25:51.367 --> 25:52.399
to said barracks tent.

25:52.401 --> 25:54.101
- I was getting to that.
- Okay, one point.

25:54.103 --> 25:55.869
After we rescue the hostages,

25:55.871 --> 25:57.938
Anton's men will no doubt be in pursuit.

25:57.940 --> 26:00.774
Not sure if you've noticed, but,
uh, Moldova's best car rental

26:00.776 --> 26:02.448
is powered by hamsters and prayer.

26:02.450 --> 26:04.306
I did notice, Russ, and I'm on it.

26:04.308 --> 26:05.979
Desi, will you crack
open one of the lights,

26:05.981 --> 26:07.294
get me the bulb?

26:07.296 --> 26:10.031
Riley, pop out the radio dial.

26:13.011 --> 26:14.667
Isn't this part usually

26:14.669 --> 26:16.462
accompanied by some
sort of "Macsplaining"?

26:16.464 --> 26:17.864
Just wait for it.

26:23.435 --> 26:25.799
All right, this is an arc lighter.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.935
Don't turn it on now, but use it to fry

26:27.937 --> 26:29.937
the onboard computers of Anton's SUV.

26:29.939 --> 26:32.740
That should buy us some time
before they start chasing us.

26:33.976 --> 26:36.210
Um, the wall. Are we going under?

26:36.212 --> 26:38.213
We're going in Kool-Aid style.

26:39.648 --> 26:41.182
Oh, yeah.

26:45.588 --> 26:47.422
Riley, hook this up to the car battery.

26:54.330 --> 26:56.997
All right, the subwoofer
acts as an oscillator,

26:56.999 --> 26:58.465
which should...

27:13.182 --> 27:14.582
... make that happen.

27:17.573 --> 27:19.496
- Emilia.
- Okay, come on.

27:19.498 --> 27:21.622
Come on. Let's go. Move.
Move, move, move. Come on.

27:21.624 --> 27:23.958
Come on. Go. Go, go, go, quick.

27:30.933 --> 27:32.467
Come on, go. Let's go.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.200
We can't all fit in there.

28:16.898 --> 28:18.520
Everybody, get in!

28:18.522 --> 28:20.647
- Let's go.
- Come on.

28:20.649 --> 28:21.982
- Get in, get in.
- Everybody, in!

28:21.984 --> 28:23.651
Go, go, go.

28:34.430 --> 28:36.130
Mac!

28:39.735 --> 28:41.902
Here, come on.

28:41.904 --> 28:44.172
Let's go! Let's go!

28:52.514 --> 28:54.348
God.

28:54.350 --> 28:56.216
She is losing a lot of blood.

28:56.218 --> 28:57.351
Just keep pressure on it.

28:58.620 --> 29:00.587
Oh, I'm sorry. Does that hurt?

29:00.589 --> 29:01.922
No, Russ, it's awesome.

29:01.924 --> 29:03.453
I did miss you.

29:03.455 --> 29:05.879
I missed you, too.

29:05.881 --> 29:07.127
Idiot.

29:13.102 --> 29:15.102
How far to the choke point?

29:15.104 --> 29:16.536
About three miles.

29:16.538 --> 29:17.871
We need to get her to a clinic.

29:17.873 --> 29:19.039
Yeah, but this isn't gonna work

29:19.041 --> 29:20.619
if we don't stick to the plan together.

29:20.621 --> 29:23.110
Stick to the plan. Let's end this.

29:23.112 --> 29:25.212
All right.

29:25.214 --> 29:26.614
We'll stick to the plan.

29:28.150 --> 29:30.884
Let's just hope Victor
held up his end of the deal.

29:51.473 --> 29:53.074
Emilia.

30:05.654 --> 30:07.487
You're hurt.

30:07.489 --> 30:09.623
- What can we do?
- Just help them.

30:09.625 --> 30:10.931
- Emilia...
- We don't have much time.

30:10.933 --> 30:12.567
Please don't argue.

30:14.797 --> 30:16.497
Just help them.

30:22.838 --> 30:25.539
Did you bring what I asked?

30:25.541 --> 30:28.208
There are two dozen IEDs
in the back of the truck.

30:28.210 --> 30:30.277
We managed to overpower
a couple of factory guards

30:30.279 --> 30:31.385
and grab their rifles.

30:31.387 --> 30:32.717
Perfect.

30:32.719 --> 30:35.039
Anton's rebels are on the move.
We got maybe eight minutes.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.660
It won't be easy.

30:46.662 --> 30:48.962
It's going to be very dangerous.

30:48.964 --> 30:51.865
But if we work together
and if we work fast,

30:51.867 --> 30:53.857
we can do this. We can win.

30:53.859 --> 30:56.069
_

31:04.179 --> 31:05.645
It's all in the delivery, darling.

31:05.647 --> 31:07.682
All right, let's get started.

31:23.832 --> 31:25.973
Sealed off and heated gunpowder

31:25.975 --> 31:28.060
boils water, creating steam,

31:28.062 --> 31:30.843
which builds pressure inside
the bottle until impact,

31:30.845 --> 31:34.375
when boom, you've got a
nonlethal knockout grenade.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.350
They're here.

32:07.743 --> 32:09.042
All right.

32:09.044 --> 32:10.477
Everybody, brace yourselves.

32:10.479 --> 32:12.480
Gunpowder and fire is
a dangerous combination.

32:18.220 --> 32:20.453
Oh. That's-that's not good.

32:20.455 --> 32:23.356
Uh, Russ, now's a good time
for another motivational speech.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.058
How about "We're outnumbered, outgunned

32:25.060 --> 32:26.493
and moments away from a slaughter"?

32:26.495 --> 32:27.929
That one needs work.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.630
Taylor, I know you're out there.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.209
Mac.

32:39.211 --> 32:40.777
We just kicked a hornet's nest

32:40.779 --> 32:42.011
of angry rebels and we're just

32:42.013 --> 32:43.400
hanging around, waiting to get stung.

32:43.402 --> 32:45.625
- I think you mean shot.
- I think I mean metaphor.

32:45.627 --> 32:46.987
Russ, I need you to buy more time.

32:49.006 --> 32:51.730
How much firepower do we have if
we came to a straight shoot-out?

32:51.732 --> 32:55.668
I'd give us 45 seconds, tops,
before we go home in boxes.

32:57.416 --> 32:58.917
Desi.

33:01.166 --> 33:02.500
Anton!

33:04.369 --> 33:06.437
Let's have a chat, shall we?

33:08.440 --> 33:11.141
Your vehicles are trapped.

33:11.143 --> 33:13.830
We have the elevated position.

33:13.832 --> 33:17.757
You'll last, what? 45 seconds, tops.

33:17.759 --> 33:20.783
You're underestimating me! Again!

33:20.785 --> 33:23.120
So, we can wipe each other
out, but what's the point, huh?

33:34.132 --> 33:35.265
Mac,

33:35.267 --> 33:36.693
hurry up before he gets himself killed.

33:36.695 --> 33:38.401
It's a homemade grenade launcher.

33:38.403 --> 33:40.271
It's not like I can
take it back to Best Buy.

33:42.507 --> 33:45.141
Help me understand, Taylor.

33:45.143 --> 33:50.013
Help me understand your
weakness for this nothing town.

33:50.015 --> 33:53.283
We both know Revaca is a
toilet full of peasants.

33:53.285 --> 33:55.302
I gave them a purpose.

33:55.304 --> 33:56.994
Infrastructure.

33:56.996 --> 33:59.853
They make my bombs, they get to eat.

33:59.855 --> 34:02.523
You've truly earned the
"World's Greatest Boss" title.

34:03.995 --> 34:06.996
We both know their true value.

34:06.998 --> 34:11.367
And thanks to you, I got
them for a good price:

34:11.369 --> 34:13.036
nothing.

34:13.038 --> 34:16.706
But now you've lost your hostages.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.009
And you let those peasants ambush you.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.545
Come on, old chum.

34:21.547 --> 34:22.969
Let's both leave this party

34:22.972 --> 34:25.274
while we're still having fun, eh?

34:30.266 --> 34:31.956
I'm not leaving.

34:31.958 --> 34:34.260
You're not leaving.

34:35.254 --> 34:37.121
So let's just get this over with.

34:42.860 --> 34:45.697
I hope you kissed your
doctor friend goodbye.

35:30.015 --> 35:31.649
Do it.

35:33.418 --> 35:34.752
Just do it!

35:37.722 --> 35:39.789
But you know the truth,

35:39.791 --> 35:42.091
don't you?

35:42.093 --> 35:45.930
Take me down, and there'll
be ten more like me.

36:16.823 --> 36:18.346
So...

36:18.348 --> 36:21.517
what do you want to do about it?

36:36.414 --> 36:39.416
Uh, your favorite.

36:40.452 --> 36:42.018
If I remember.

36:42.020 --> 36:44.254
Yes.

36:45.247 --> 36:48.337
Anton and his men left town.

36:48.339 --> 36:50.593
The factory's abandoned.

36:50.595 --> 36:52.095
How did you do it?

36:52.097 --> 36:55.431
I made it clear that we had
evidence of his war crimes,

36:55.433 --> 36:59.670
and, um, the U.N. doesn't
take those things lightly.

37:01.673 --> 37:03.841
You've changed, Russ.

37:04.876 --> 37:07.377
I'm proud of you.

37:07.379 --> 37:08.711
Well, um,

37:08.713 --> 37:10.246
wheels up in ten.

37:10.248 --> 37:12.815
I just, uh, wanted to come by and, uh,

37:12.817 --> 37:14.817
say goodbye.

37:14.819 --> 37:16.253
Thank you.

37:17.990 --> 37:20.091
For everything.

37:22.494 --> 37:24.494
Goodbye.

37:24.496 --> 37:26.330
Russ.

37:38.309 --> 37:41.278
We would have killed
each other, you know.

37:43.181 --> 37:45.882
But what a way to go.

38:09.340 --> 38:11.708
You made another deal with Anton.

38:14.412 --> 38:16.746
It wasn't the U.N.

38:16.748 --> 38:18.881
You paid him off.

38:18.883 --> 38:21.465
Again.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.690
If you took him out,

38:23.692 --> 38:25.856
it would leave a power
vacuum that begs to be filled,

38:25.858 --> 38:27.881
and then we would be back in two years,

38:27.883 --> 38:30.293
fighting a whole new
group of insurgents.

38:30.295 --> 38:34.530
Paying Anton off buys Revaca
some safety for a decade,

38:34.532 --> 38:36.032
more or less.

38:36.034 --> 38:39.535
And then when we do come back...

38:39.537 --> 38:41.971
it's the devil you know.

38:44.542 --> 38:47.210
The U.N. wouldn't have been any help.

38:47.212 --> 38:49.712
An investigation would've taken a year.

38:49.714 --> 38:52.415
And even then, there's no guarantee.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.583
So,

38:53.585 --> 38:54.750
I did...

38:54.752 --> 38:56.619
What you had to do.

38:56.621 --> 38:58.956
I get it now.

39:01.226 --> 39:04.194
And I kind of wish I didn't.

39:05.230 --> 39:08.564
This job used to be
way less complicated.

39:08.566 --> 39:11.400
We go on missions, we
save lives, we come home.

39:11.402 --> 39:14.203
But lately...

39:14.205 --> 39:16.005
it's different.

39:16.007 --> 39:19.809
I don't even know how to describe it.

39:19.811 --> 39:23.546
It's like there's a shadow
cast over everything.

39:23.548 --> 39:27.050
This thing with Codex, with Matty...

39:29.521 --> 39:31.522
... the people that we deal with...

39:33.525 --> 39:35.859
... the darkness that we see.

39:39.023 --> 39:41.858
The world isn't black-and-white.

39:45.781 --> 39:48.316
Sometimes the only
thing you can do is...

39:48.318 --> 39:50.675
The wrong thing.

39:50.677 --> 39:53.012
For the right reason.

40:06.124 --> 40:08.891
Hey. They're on the plane.

40:08.893 --> 40:10.123
I'm gonna head out.

40:10.125 --> 40:12.126
Good night.

40:24.542 --> 40:26.877
Voice encoding enabled.

40:29.009 --> 40:31.198
Hi, it's me.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.556
It's been a while.

40:32.558 --> 40:35.051
I know that you're dealing
with a lot right now,

40:35.053 --> 40:37.687
but we need to talk.

40:37.689 --> 40:40.690
I don't know if I'm just being paranoid

40:40.692 --> 40:43.893
or if I'm seeing ghosts, but...

40:43.895 --> 40:45.795
I think she's back.

40:45.797 --> 40:49.098
You need to come see
me as soon as possible.
