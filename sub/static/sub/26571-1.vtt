Captain Jack Turner?

01:28.763 --> 01:29.498
Yes sir.

01:30.533 --> 01:32.066
It's an honor
to meet you, son.

01:32.068 --> 01:34.468
Sorry this couldn't wait
until you healed up,

01:34.470 --> 01:35.936
but we follow procedure
very carefully

01:35.938 --> 01:37.474
on this type of thing.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.575
Please, sit.

01:41.110 --> 01:45.611
Well I... I understand.

01:45.613 --> 01:46.682
Good.

01:47.015 --> 01:47.981
Jack,

01:47.983 --> 01:48.882
we need to debrief you

01:48.884 --> 01:51.051
on the events
that recently occurred.

01:51.053 --> 01:52.752
Everything that happened.

01:52.754 --> 01:54.491
No detail is too small.

01:55.057 --> 01:56.055
I want you to know that

01:56.057 --> 01:59.025
President Roosevelt
personally commends you

01:59.027 --> 02:00.830
and all of Lt. Colonel
Jimmy Doolittle's Raiders.

02:02.063 --> 02:04.897
As you know, after Pearl Harbor,
bombing Tokyo

02:04.899 --> 02:08.568
became of paramount
importance to the President.

02:08.570 --> 02:10.737
You guys really pulled it off.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.840
Thank you, Lieutenant.

02:12.842 --> 02:14.577
Thank you.

02:17.813 --> 02:21.718
How many...
how many of us made it back?

02:22.851 --> 02:23.986
Before we get into that,
Captain Turner,

02:25.588 --> 02:27.820
it's important that we hear
your side of the story,

02:27.822 --> 02:29.590
exactly as it happened.

02:29.592 --> 02:30.959
Particularly, your experience
on the ground in China.

02:32.427 --> 02:34.530
Who helped you and how
did you get out of there.

02:37.632 --> 02:39.432
What about the girl?

02:39.434 --> 02:40.803
The girl will be fine.

02:44.572 --> 02:45.675
Ok.

02:46.909 --> 02:50.811
Well. We started off

02:50.813 --> 02:53.450
with an unexpected launch
off the Hornet.

02:54.749 --> 02:58.885
<i>Sixteen B-25's
all crammed onto a flattop,</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:01.557
<i>seven hundred miles
off the coast of Japan...</i>

03:02.491 --> 03:04.056
Is this a drill, Sir?

03:04.058 --> 03:05.592
Ain't no drill, Jack.

03:05.594 --> 03:07.597
We've been compromised
by a Jap patrol boat.

03:08.196 --> 03:09.064
It's now or never.

03:10.465 --> 03:11.765
We're four hours
from the take-off zone!

03:11.767 --> 03:12.832
We don't have the gas!

03:12.834 --> 03:14.735
If we get a
tail wind from Japan,

03:14.737 --> 03:16.503
we'll make it to China.

03:16.505 --> 03:17.674
Now get on board, son,

03:18.140 --> 03:19.439
and Godspeed.

03:28.650 --> 03:30.818
Pilot to Crew, comms check.

03:30.820 --> 03:31.755
Navigator to Pilot. Copy?

03:32.588 --> 03:33.954
Alright, Copy, Navigator.

03:33.956 --> 03:35.055
Gunner to Pilot. Copy?

03:35.057 --> 03:36.189
I got you, Stevie.

03:36.191 --> 03:36.892
Bombardier to Pilot, copy?

03:37.593 --> 03:38.494
<i>Alright. Copy that.</i>

03:39.362 --> 03:41.431
Brace yourselves, boys,
this is it.

03:56.045 --> 03:57.544
<i>What the hell's
he waiting for?!</i>

03:57.546 --> 04:00.116
Swell's gotta rise.
Slingshot us out.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.253
- We're too heavy!
- We're good!

04:07.255 --> 04:09.658
- Jack!
- We are good! Flaps down!

06:21.357 --> 06:22.725
There's Tokyo!

06:24.059 --> 06:26.393
Pilot to Bombardier,
one minute from first target.

06:26.395 --> 06:27.730
Copy that, Captain.

06:30.799 --> 06:32.699
Open your bomb bay doors, Ben.

06:32.701 --> 06:34.270
Opening bomb doors, Captain.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.675
Gunner to Pilot,
fighter ten o'clock and diving!

06:41.677 --> 06:43.345
<i>Less talking,
more shooting, Stevie!</i>

06:56.992 --> 06:58.158
I got him! I got him!

06:58.160 --> 06:59.595
<i>Good Boy!</i>

07:04.199 --> 07:07.069
There's our target One,
Asahi Electrical.

07:09.672 --> 07:11.040
BOMBS AWAY!

07:14.410 --> 07:15.776
Direct hit!

07:16.778 --> 07:18.947
Yokoyama warehouse, dead ahead.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.084
Bombs away!

07:27.756 --> 07:29.889
It's a bulls eye. Bombs away!

07:33.429 --> 07:35.896
Just the incendiary,
then we're out of here!

07:35.898 --> 07:38.098
Coming up on Mitsubishi
aircraft works.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.135
<i>Give 'em hell, Bennie.</i>

07:39.768 --> 07:41.070
Bombs away!

07:52.413 --> 07:53.280
Everyone got a pulse?

07:53.282 --> 07:54.615
A-okay, Captain!

07:54.617 --> 07:56.382
<i>It's the Fourth of July
down there, Captain!</i>

07:56.384 --> 07:58.185
Why don't you set us a
course for China, Mannie?

07:58.187 --> 07:58.787
Yes, sir.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.424
<i>Get us on the
Chungking Express.</i>

11:52.054 --> 11:54.421
Starboard engine's sucking
way too much gas.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.458
This headwind
ain't helping either.

11:55.991 --> 11:57.691
Hey Stevie,
you definitely emptied

11:57.693 --> 11:59.225
every single one of those cans?

11:59.227 --> 12:00.196
<i>All of them, Captain.</i>

12:01.229 --> 12:02.962
Ok, well, dump 'em...
and any ammo you got left.

12:02.964 --> 12:04.530
You, too, Ben.
Come on, go, go, go!

12:04.532 --> 12:07.068
Mannie, how far away
are we from Quzhou airfield?

12:07.703 --> 12:09.338
Six-zero minutes, Captain.

12:10.137 --> 12:11.206
Then we'll make it...

12:13.641 --> 12:15.143
Land ahoy!

12:43.204 --> 12:45.708
OK, guys, prepare for landing!
This may get rough.

12:56.418 --> 12:58.118
What's going on?!
What the hell are they doing?

12:58.120 --> 12:59.221
You see the runway?

13:00.756 --> 13:02.290
I don't see a damn thing!

13:06.361 --> 13:07.697
What are we going to do, Jack?

13:09.530 --> 13:10.565
Plan B.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.426
Okay, just like
we practiced, everybody.

15:20.428 --> 15:22.895
Get your chutes on and prepare
to bail out of the plane.

15:24.598 --> 15:26.734
Alright. Go on, get your
asses down to the hatch!

16:28.496 --> 16:29.932
- Jack?
- Gotta do this manually now.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.465
Get out with the others, Mannie.

16:32.467 --> 16:33.535
Tell them to jump, right now!

16:34.736 --> 16:36.905
Right goddamn now!
That's an order, soldier!

16:37.572 --> 16:38.908
Go, go! Jump!

31:00.401 --> 31:01.336
Hey!

31:01.868 --> 31:03.504
Wait. Wait!

31:04.338 --> 31:07.341
No. Do you speak English?

31:08.142 --> 31:09.444
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

31:14.781 --> 31:15.316
<i>Doctor?</i>

31:16.082 --> 31:18.182
<i>Do you know what a doctor is?</i>

32:14.375 --> 32:15.443
What is it?

32:20.481 --> 32:20.882
The Japanese?

32:21.682 --> 32:22.450
Are the Japanese coming?

32:28.888 --> 32:30.591
OK, OK!

38:41.595 --> 38:43.497
I need to find my crew.

38:44.196 --> 38:45.066
They bailed out with me...

38:46.633 --> 38:49.971
you understand... you understand
what I am saying...

38:50.803 --> 38:53.240
you know what I mean...

45:45.185 --> 45:46.287
Hey!

46:44.410 --> 46:45.511
Thank you.

46:56.756 --> 46:58.192
Nunu?

47:00.593 --> 47:02.062
Nunu?

47:04.696 --> 47:05.665
Jack.

47:07.300 --> 47:08.568
I am Jack,

47:09.269 --> 47:12.238
Jack. Nunu, Jack.

47:18.111 --> 47:18.679
Yeah.

48:05.825 --> 48:08.828
That was...
that was good, thank you.

48:20.573 --> 48:27.513
There were...
there were five of us,

48:32.285 --> 48:33.120
that's a plane.

48:33.852 --> 48:36.754
That's me... that's Jack.

48:36.756 --> 48:41.828
I need to find my other four...
my crew.

48:49.202 --> 48:50.537
Do you know?

48:51.905 --> 48:53.140
They've been captured?

48:53.872 --> 48:56.142
The Japanese have captured them?

49:01.214 --> 49:03.848
You know...
do you know where they are?

49:03.850 --> 49:05.652
Do you know where they are?

49:10.890 --> 49:13.627
You don't...
You don't know what I am saying.

53:10.897 --> 53:12.032
Sorry.

53:21.540 --> 53:23.410
You want me to go
back down there?

53:32.852 --> 53:34.087
Alright.

53:37.522 --> 53:40.526
Come back with someone
who can help me, OK?

53:42.028 --> 53:44.731
Chungking,
I've got to get to Chungking.

53:45.131 --> 53:46.464
Chungking?

53:46.466 --> 53:47.868
Yeah, yeah, Chungking.

55:08.914 --> 55:11.217
Come on, Jim,
what the hell are you doing?

55:17.256 --> 55:18.158
Screw it.

56:41.207 --> 56:42.842
No, I'm just...
I am fixing the roof.

56:44.075 --> 56:45.010
I am fixing the roof.

56:47.146 --> 56:47.747
Alright.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.912
I am coming. Okay.

56:49.914 --> 56:51.117
Alright.

56:52.952 --> 56:53.352
Alright.

56:53.885 --> 56:55.051
Alright.

56:55.053 --> 56:57.756
I watched for twenty minutes,
there is nobody around.

57:03.396 --> 57:04.664
I am sorry.

57:07.667 --> 57:09.966
I was just trying
to fix the roof, OK?

57:09.968 --> 57:11.604
I am sorry!

57:28.254 --> 57:29.756
I am not going back
down there. OK?

57:30.856 --> 57:33.959
I can't breathe down there.
I can't breathe.

57:35.694 --> 57:37.731
No! No! No!

57:38.296 --> 57:38.995
No, no!

57:38.997 --> 57:41.397
Why am I even still here, OK?

57:41.399 --> 57:42.668
Why haven't you
brought anybody yet?

57:43.669 --> 57:45.401
I don't even know
what the hell is going on.

57:45.403 --> 57:47.006
I need to get out of here!

58:11.497 --> 58:13.966
I had no right
to speak to you like that.

58:15.133 --> 58:18.000
<i>This is your house.</i>

58:18.002 --> 58:19.269
<i>You've done nothing but help me</i>

58:19.271 --> 58:21.807
<i>and all I did was
act like an ass!</i>

58:24.276 --> 58:27.176
I... I will go downstairs, OK?

58:27.178 --> 58:28.847
I go downstairs.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:49.982
Jack?

01:03:47.466 --> 01:03:50.737
Hey, you in there hiding?

01:03:58.343 --> 01:03:59.245
<i>Try it.</i>

01:04:04.783 --> 01:04:06.618
C'mon, you can do
better than that.

01:04:11.356 --> 01:04:12.792
<i>Ah, you did it!</i>

01:04:13.524 --> 01:04:14.691
<i>You got it.</i>

01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:37.680
<i>One, Two, Three,</i>

01:04:37.682 --> 01:04:47.092
Four, Five, Six, Seven,
Eight, Nine, Ten. One!

01:04:49.694 --> 01:04:50.830
- One.
- One.

01:04:52.464 --> 01:04:53.266
Two.

01:04:57.169 --> 01:04:58.371
<i>Two.</i>

01:05:00.671 --> 01:05:01.540
<i>Three.</i>

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:02.809
<i>Three.</i>

01:05:04.475 --> 01:05:05.410
Three.

01:05:05.877 --> 01:05:07.146
Three.

01:05:41.446 --> 01:05:42.381
This is great...

01:05:45.484 --> 01:05:46.519
thank you.

01:06:39.738 --> 01:06:41.671
I know you guys can't
understand me right now.

01:06:41.673 --> 01:06:46.843
But, I just want to say
thank you, you know.

01:06:46.845 --> 01:06:47.879
Thank you.

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:16.441
And this is the best duck
I've ever had too, by the way.

01:07:17.975 --> 01:07:18.743
Really good.

01:13:59.944 --> 01:14:01.411
YingYou OK?

01:14:01.413 --> 01:14:02.714
Are you OK?

01:14:03.213 --> 01:14:04.015
Are you OK?

01:14:04.716 --> 01:14:07.019
Look, Shh... Shhhhh... be quiet.

01:14:16.761 --> 01:14:19.362
Ying, listen, listen,
pull yourself together, OK?

01:14:19.364 --> 01:14:21.063
We're in a lot of
trouble right now.

01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:24.233
We need to move him
down here right now, OK?

01:14:24.235 --> 01:14:25.237
OK? C'mon!

01:16:54.953 --> 01:16:55.854
American,

01:16:56.454 --> 01:16:57.489
<i>if you are here,</i>

01:16:58.256 --> 01:16:59.091
I am your friend,

01:16:59.591 --> 01:17:00.559
I can help you.

01:17:02.126 --> 01:17:04.426
Sit down and put your hands
where I can see them.

01:17:04.428 --> 01:17:05.797
Come on in, lock the door.

01:17:11.903 --> 01:17:13.135
<i>I told you to sit down!</i>

01:17:13.137 --> 01:17:14.873
- Okay.
- <i>Sit the hell down!</i>

01:17:18.508 --> 01:17:19.243
Who are you?

01:17:20.078 --> 01:17:20.710
I am Nunu's teacher.

01:17:20.712 --> 01:17:21.710
<i>I work for guerrillas.</i>

01:17:21.712 --> 01:17:24.448
How do I know you're
not with the Japanese?

01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:26.017
I can help you.

01:17:27.052 --> 01:17:29.054
I can get a boat to take you
upriver to safety.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.486
Yeah, but where?

01:17:30.488 --> 01:17:31.356
Chungking.

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:33.889
Chungking?

01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:34.991
- Yes.
- Chungking?

01:17:34.993 --> 01:17:35.526
Yes!

01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:48.403
How far is this river?

01:17:48.405 --> 01:17:49.639
Behind the mountain...

01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:50.506
half day walk.

01:17:50.508 --> 01:17:52.608
<i>My leg is going to slow us down.</i>

01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:53.979
We will carry you.

01:18:07.324 --> 01:18:08.292
Wait, wait.

01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.144
C'mon. C'mon.

01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:07.359
American, get in the chair!

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:02.036
Get down!

01:25:04.941 --> 01:25:06.744
Get down!

01:27:22.812 --> 01:27:23.714
Ying!!!

01:28:28.579 --> 01:28:30.812
<i>We arrived at some town.</i>

01:28:30.814 --> 01:28:32.717
<i>I can't remember the name.</i>

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:36.718
<i>The locals handed
Nunu and I over</i>

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.890
<i>to the Chinese Nationalist Army.</i>

01:28:40.658 --> 01:28:42.894
<i>They tried to separate us.</i>

01:28:44.227 --> 01:28:45.596
<i>They tried.</i>

01:28:46.596 --> 01:28:47.898
<i>I brought her with me.</i>

01:28:49.232 --> 01:28:52.035
<i>Same thing happened
in Chungking. So...</i>

01:28:54.038 --> 01:28:56.040
It's why she's here with me now.

01:29:01.177 --> 01:29:02.680
What about the others?

01:29:05.815 --> 01:29:08.317
We're still missing a dozen men.

01:29:12.957 --> 01:29:14.689
<i>Thank you, Captain Turner.</i>

01:29:14.691 --> 01:29:15.827
<i>That will be all.</i>

01:29:32.976 --> 01:29:34.278
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:29:34.979 --> 01:29:35.680
Jack,

01:29:36.681 --> 01:29:37.949
I think you're ready
to face the world again.

01:29:38.649 --> 01:29:40.115
How are you, sir?
I'll be damned!

01:29:40.117 --> 01:29:41.649
I'm good, good.

01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:43.221
I believe they didn't have
to chop off your leg.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:44.955
Yeah, they patched it up
pretty good.

01:29:46.623 --> 01:29:49.860
I'm glad to hear that,
cause I got plans for you, son.

01:29:52.229 --> 01:29:53.798
And what's your name,
pretty one?

01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:55.098
Say hi.

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.171
Sit, Jack.
We got to do some talking.

01:30:00.738 --> 01:30:01.271
Alright.

01:30:03.406 --> 01:30:06.140
Lt. Sheng here has briefed me
on all you went through.

01:30:06.142 --> 01:30:07.878
You were lucky
to get out alive, son.

01:30:08.846 --> 01:30:09.914
I know, I know.

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:12.282
We lost a lot
of good men there...

01:30:12.915 --> 01:30:14.686
But their sacrifice
was worth it.

01:30:16.153 --> 01:30:18.021
She also told me you
want to adopt this little girl.

01:30:18.655 --> 01:30:20.091
Yeah, Nunu.

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:27.365
You can't do it, Jack.

01:30:29.098 --> 01:30:30.668
You see, you're going
back into action soon.

01:30:31.869 --> 01:30:34.238
I'm starting a new unit...
sub hunting...

01:30:35.271 --> 01:30:36.740
and I'm going to need you there.

01:30:40.778 --> 01:30:42.747
With all due respect, sir,

01:30:43.681 --> 01:30:45.650
she's lost everything she has.

01:30:46.949 --> 01:30:48.285
Jack, there's a war going on...

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.323
you can't be doing
two things at the same time.

01:30:53.457 --> 01:30:55.756
The social welfare people
have found

01:30:55.758 --> 01:30:57.095
a nice Chinese couple
willing to adopt her.

01:30:58.195 --> 01:31:00.895
They live out east...
in Los Angeles.

01:31:00.897 --> 01:31:01.929
I checked up on them.

01:31:01.931 --> 01:31:03.298
They're good people.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:06.204
They'll bring her up better than
her mother could've wished for.

01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:13.945
I can't just... leave her.

01:31:17.413 --> 01:31:22.119
Jack, you have to.

01:31:35.132 --> 01:31:38.803
Hey... you be good, alright?

01:31:40.137 --> 01:31:45.743
They're going to take
good care of you. And......

01:32:03.994 --> 01:32:08.766
They're going to take
real good care of you. Alright?

01:32:19.877 --> 01:32:22.510
Jack, there's
a bunch of press people

01:32:22.512 --> 01:32:24.015
waiting for you
down the hall here.

01:32:25.114 --> 01:32:26.483
You gotta go out there
and be a hero.

01:32:27.784 --> 01:32:29.220
I will leave you alone
for a minute.

01:33:31.848 --> 01:33:32.350
<i>Dear Nunu,</i>

01:33:33.383 --> 01:33:36.419
<i>It's been too long,
much too long.</i>

01:33:37.253 --> 01:33:39.286
<i>Funny how life passes.</i>

01:33:39.288 --> 01:33:43.425
<i>It spins around, and before you
can take it all into account,</i>

01:33:43.427 --> 01:33:45.163
<i>you've lived a lifetime.</i>

01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:50.932
<i>Fifty years have gone by
since we first met</i>

01:33:50.934 --> 01:33:52.600
<i>and not a day of that goes by</i>

01:33:52.602 --> 01:33:54.838
<i>that I don't think about
your mother.</i>

01:33:56.073 --> 01:33:58.206
<i>I guess you know
I fell in love with her</i>

01:33:58.208 --> 01:34:00.508
<i>and often wonder
what my life could've been</i>

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:02.847
<i>with her and with you.</i>

01:34:04.146 --> 01:34:08.383
<i>My own life will soon
becoming to a finish</i>

01:34:08.385 --> 01:34:10.417
<i>and I want you to know
before I go</i>

01:34:10.419 --> 01:34:12.422
<i>that your mother
did not die in vain.</i>

01:34:13.589 --> 01:34:16.894
<i>She died a hero
of the Chinese People.</i>

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:21.966
<i>With Love and Respect,
Jack.</i>
