it was my stupid

how come I can
still see you on

laboratory is on
emergency power?

13:47.233 --> 13:48.450
Wait! It was me.

13:48.483 --> 13:53.166
It was I, Dexter, boy genius,
using my superior intellect,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.350
I was able to take control
of your satellite.

13:55.383 --> 13:58.433
My dad is an idiot...Innocent.

13:58.466 --> 14:01.450
I am the one
who should be punished.

14:01.483 --> 14:03.300
Psst! Play dead.

14:03.333 --> 14:08.133
Huh, nice try kid.
I'm a boy genius.

14:09.150 --> 14:10.350
Man: Ok. Let's see.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.350
Mr. Dexter's dad.

14:12.383 --> 14:16.483
Ah yes, he's been
free to go for weeks.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.350
Dexter's dad: Ha ha!

14:18.383 --> 14:20.150
Whoo-hoo!

14:20.183 --> 14:21.250
Heh heh!

14:21.283 --> 14:22.216
Whoa.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.183
No whammy!

14:24.216 --> 14:25.050
Huh?

14:25.083 --> 14:27.266
Look at that sunset.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.366
If only I'd known,

14:28.400 --> 14:33.050
I would have gotten
myself arrested years ago.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.216
[Bell ringing]

14:53.266 --> 15:00.033
Ah, the sweet and silent
solitude of the school
library.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.383
Oh yeah, we're so
prepared for this.

15:01.416 --> 15:03.200
This is going to
be a great game,

15:03.233 --> 15:04.333
we're going
to kicky Booty.

15:04.366 --> 15:06.300
Our new cheers
are so awesome.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.283
Wait until
you see them,

15:07.316 --> 15:09.150
you're just not
gonna believe it!

15:09.183 --> 15:11.400
Ahem!

15:15.266 --> 15:16.450
No book for you,

15:16.483 --> 15:20.150
and no book for you!

15:26.083 --> 15:28.216
No, uh-uh.
You know the rules.

15:28.250 --> 15:31.266
No food or drink
in the library.

15:31.300 --> 15:34.000
No book for you!

15:42.350 --> 15:45.066
Mis-using
school property,

15:45.100 --> 15:47.300
you know better
than that.

15:47.333 --> 15:51.016
No book for you!

15:58.300 --> 16:04.433
Ah, here we are.
701.328.

16:04.466 --> 16:08.000
[Gasp]
Hello! What is this!

16:08.033 --> 16:10.150
<i>Green bacon and eggs!</i>

16:10.183 --> 16:11.216
What is a childrens' book

16:11.250 --> 16:15.033
doing in
coelacanth paleobiology?

16:17.166 --> 16:20.333
Miss salinger
miss salinger.

16:20.366 --> 16:22.400
Yes, what is it,
Dexter?

16:22.433 --> 16:24.083
I have found an...

16:24.116 --> 16:26.033
Inappropriately
placed...

16:26.066 --> 16:27.150
Piece of fiction.

16:27.183 --> 16:29.050
Really?
Well, be a dear

16:29.083 --> 16:32.050
and place it in
its proper home.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.150
Ahh.

16:36.183 --> 16:40.183
Library patrons speaking
at unacceptable volumes,
eating snacks,

16:40.216 --> 16:44.316
abusing school property,
and now this.

16:44.350 --> 16:47.183
It is all very disappointing.

16:47.216 --> 16:50.366
You know, I like
miss salinger and all,

16:50.400 --> 16:52.233
but if this were my library,

16:52.266 --> 16:55.216
such behavior within
these hallowed shelves

16:55.250 --> 16:57.000
would not be tolerated.

16:57.033 --> 16:59.133
Oh, my, look at
the time.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.350
Dexter,
I have to be at
a staff meeting.

17:01.383 --> 17:06.200
I need you to keep
an eye on things
for one hour.

17:28.383 --> 17:30.066
Ahh!

17:30.100 --> 17:32.400
[Tapping finger]

17:49.183 --> 17:51.433
[Ah-choo]

18:00.016 --> 18:02.100
Finally, a school library

18:02.133 --> 18:04.450
dedicated to
the pure appreciation

18:04.483 --> 18:06.316
of the English language.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.116
Dexter, you have done it again.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.050
Next!

18:10.083 --> 18:12.016
[Buzzer sounds]

18:12.050 --> 18:12.450
Sarah goldfarm.

18:12.483 --> 18:16.366
Another early
return, I see.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
Ha ha ha!

18:17.433 --> 18:20.416
<i>Stranger Rick:</i>
August 2001.

18:20.450 --> 18:22.000
A solid
subject matter,

18:22.033 --> 18:24.166
but a little
sophomoric
for second grade.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.016
Would you not agree?

18:26.050 --> 18:27.150
Robot, please
retrieve

18:27.183 --> 18:28.333
some less
frivolous reading

18:28.366 --> 18:29.466
for miss goldfarm?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.483
Perhaps something
from coelacanth
paleobiology,

18:33.016 --> 18:36.016
a personal favorite
subject of mine.

18:47.016 --> 18:48.333
Cannot confirm
target.

18:48.366 --> 18:51.000
Cannot confirm
target?

18:51.033 --> 18:54.366
You illiterate
Android!

18:54.400 --> 18:56.283
Must I spell
everything out

18:56.316 --> 18:58.400
for you recycled
soup cans?

19:00.400 --> 19:03.100
Ahh!

19:04.200 --> 19:07.016
[Dexter whistling]

19:11.083 --> 19:12.200
Heh heh!

19:12.233 --> 19:16.250
System error.
Cannot confirm
target.

19:16.283 --> 19:19.033
Arr!

19:19.233 --> 19:25.233
Why must I do
everything myself?

19:26.116 --> 19:28.400
[Grumbling]

19:30.100 --> 19:31.266
...stupid-looking robots.

19:31.300 --> 19:39.166
There, coelacanth
paleobiology.
Now, how difficult was that?

19:39.200 --> 19:43.116
<i>Green bacon and eggs?</i>

19:43.150 --> 19:47.000
But I do not like
<i>green bacon and eggs!</i>

19:47.033 --> 19:51.066
There is not a walnut brain ape
among you who is worthy to share

19:51.100 --> 19:55.316
my world-class collection
of written history.

20:44.266 --> 20:47.383
Dexter, I am very
disappointed in you.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.216
I leave you in
charge of
the library

20:49.250 --> 20:51.450
for one hour,
and look what
you do.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.283
Just look at
this mess.

20:53.316 --> 20:56.116
But--but--
I...they...

20:56.150 --> 20:59.233
I'm giving you
the maximum
library penalty.

20:59.266 --> 21:00.216
[Gasping]

21:00.250 --> 21:01.483
No! Not that!

21:02.016 --> 21:04.083
Please,
miss salinger. No!

21:04.116 --> 21:05.250
That's right.

21:05.283 --> 21:07.333
You can only check out
4 books a week,
instead of 5.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.400
Boo hoo hoo.
Don't do this to me.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.383
It's not very
nice of you.

21:12.416 --> 21:15.416
No!

21:15.450 --> 21:17.083
