<i>(woman shouting in Chinese)</i>

00:22.832 --> 00:24.199
Cleary: All right, back away.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.235
Back away.

00:26.269 --> 00:28.336
Christ, what have you done to yourself?

00:28.337 --> 00:30.038
Just get me out of here.

00:30.173 --> 00:31.673
All right, come on. I'll have
you to the Knick in no time.

00:31.675 --> 00:34.676
No, take me to Mount Sinai.

00:36.244 --> 00:39.347
You do good work.

00:39.381 --> 00:41.849
Barrow: It was good work. Now it's gone.

00:41.850 --> 00:43.885
Thanks to your good work.

00:43.886 --> 00:46.120
What do you mean?

00:46.121 --> 00:48.222
<i>It ain't too hard to put together.</i>

00:48.390 --> 00:51.725
<i>You got what you wanted, the whole
damn thing starts over again</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:54.596
<i>and so does your skimming off of it.</i>

00:54.597 --> 00:57.198
You think I did this?

00:57.299 --> 01:00.159
He collapsed a few days ago and
was brought here for examination.

01:00.268 --> 01:04.404
An endoscope revealed at least
one ischemic section of bowel.

01:04.471 --> 01:07.673
The likely cause was his
extensive use of cocaine

01:07.709 --> 01:11.411
in all forms and other substances.

01:11.412 --> 01:13.780
Heroin.

01:13.781 --> 01:16.383
It was heroin.

01:16.484 --> 01:20.020
But I don't think it's got
anything to do with this.

01:21.322 --> 01:23.623
It may have masked the pain.

01:23.658 --> 01:27.294
I should mention the
patient is a physician.

01:29.263 --> 01:32.499
The recommended procedure is resecting.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.734
Once the patient is anesthetized,

01:34.736 --> 01:36.303
we'll remove the necrotic areas

01:36.437 --> 01:38.939
and then, using elastic ligatures
and the McGraw method,

01:38.940 --> 01:41.641
unite the healthy areas.

01:41.642 --> 01:43.275
Questions?

01:43.276 --> 01:45.645
Yeah, just one modification.

01:45.646 --> 01:47.879
No anesthesia.

01:49.182 --> 01:50.882
You want to remain awake?

01:50.917 --> 01:54.353
I want you to use my
spinal block instead.

01:54.354 --> 01:56.455
I won't do it.

01:56.456 --> 01:58.190
<i>Why not?</i>

01:58.191 --> 01:59.758
I don't believe in it.

01:59.826 --> 02:02.594
You've read my paper.
You've seen the evidence.

02:02.696 --> 02:06.798
I've also seen the papers that
have refuted your initial success.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.435
Several cases of permanent paralysis.

02:09.469 --> 02:12.237
<i>Obviously performed by incompetence.</i>

Got the 95 from
Minna O'Fallon's brothel.

02:29.055 --> 02:31.056
They want to up their
order for next week.

02:31.057 --> 02:32.523
A third more of everything.

02:32.524 --> 02:34.492
Put it in the tin.

02:37.697 --> 02:40.298
Let's start getting the
next load in the truck.

02:40.332 --> 02:42.567
This one's for Pinkey's
Gentleman's Joint.

02:42.568 --> 02:45.669
400 condoms, 50 sponges.

02:45.670 --> 02:47.504
- Box number 16.
- All right.

02:47.505 --> 02:48.706
They'll owe you $90.

02:48.707 --> 02:50.540
Stack it on there.

02:50.541 --> 02:53.543
All right. Back in a jiff.

02:53.544 --> 02:56.713
(whistling)

02:56.815 --> 02:59.249
Henry: <i>Just this list of
guests I've given you.</i>

02:59.250 --> 03:01.118
<i>I had my mother take a look at it,</i>

03:01.186 --> 03:05.555
<i>but she was so upset,
she didn't get very far.</i>

03:05.590 --> 03:08.458
<i>So my judgment will have to suffice.</i>

03:08.492 --> 03:11.860
<i>If someone was missed, so be it.</i>

03:13.663 --> 03:15.964
That's it for now.

03:17.901 --> 03:20.002
Valet: Dinner, sir.

03:20.003 --> 03:21.904
Nothing for me.

03:24.674 --> 03:26.943
You should eat something.

03:26.944 --> 03:29.011
(sighs)

03:30.214 --> 03:32.247
You have it.

03:35.051 --> 03:37.385
An apple or a pear at least.

03:39.222 --> 03:40.756
(chuckles)

03:40.757 --> 03:42.991
I haven't got any appetite.

03:55.805 --> 03:57.873
I'm...

03:57.874 --> 04:00.742
I'm taking my mom

04:00.743 --> 04:03.444
up to our house in Newport

04:03.445 --> 04:06.414
after the funeral

04:06.415 --> 04:08.749
to spend the summer.

04:08.785 --> 04:11.252
She needs to be away from all of this.

04:12.789 --> 04:14.789
What about your work?

04:15.992 --> 04:19.260
I can do most of it
using the telephone.

04:23.299 --> 04:27.101
There's also a guesthouse.

04:29.471 --> 04:32.239
It has a beautiful view of the ocean.

04:34.610 --> 04:36.644
I think you'll love it.

04:39.682 --> 04:42.149
Are you asking me to come?

04:44.085 --> 04:47.121
I don't know what I'd do without you.

04:48.490 --> 04:50.825
Lucy. Lucy.

04:50.826 --> 04:52.426
Please.

04:53.529 --> 04:56.163
Things are bad enough.

04:56.164 --> 04:59.166
Don't make me pine for you as well.

05:01.303 --> 05:05.339
And it's a beautiful guesthouse.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.809
The McKinleys stayed there the
summer before he won in '96.

05:08.810 --> 05:10.910
Of course it is.

05:12.814 --> 05:15.382
And I'm sure the future
president didn't visit

05:15.483 --> 05:18.318
without the promise of a
commitment from your father.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.305
Herman Barrow.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.474
Yes?

06:48.475 --> 06:51.076
Police Detective Tuggle.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.678
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.448
What sort?

06:57.483 --> 07:01.252
About the fire that took
August Robertson's life.

07:03.088 --> 07:06.123
Darling, would you
wait in the carriage?

07:06.124 --> 07:08.392
I'll only be a moment.

07:10.896 --> 07:13.231
Your daughter?

07:14.399 --> 07:16.433
No.

07:16.569 --> 07:21.672
So I'm supposing she's not the
current Mrs. Herman Barrow.

07:21.673 --> 07:24.941
Sad as it is for my beloved children,

07:24.943 --> 07:27.511
I'm divorcing their mother.

07:27.612 --> 07:30.481
But this has nothing to do
with the hospital or my work,

07:30.482 --> 07:32.650
so what were your questions?

07:34.853 --> 07:36.787
(sighs)

07:36.955 --> 07:39.856
You were in charge of the construction
of the new Knickerbocker?

07:39.958 --> 07:43.260
I oversaw it. The board of
directors thought it best

07:43.261 --> 07:45.496
to have me lead the project,

07:45.530 --> 07:48.064
but that was mostly
cost and expenditures.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.101
The architect, a Mr. Frazier Wingo

07:51.102 --> 07:53.603
<i>and then a Raphael Warren,</i>

07:53.605 --> 07:55.605
<i>were in charge on the ground.</i>

07:55.640 --> 07:58.475
Yes, we've already talked to Mr. Wingo.

07:58.476 --> 08:00.476
<i>Really?</i>

08:00.612 --> 08:04.180
Well, I hope you found him to
be as untrustworthy as we did.

08:04.181 --> 08:06.282
We terminated him weeks ago.

08:06.283 --> 08:08.118
He's a scoundrel.

08:08.152 --> 08:11.054
<i>He thought you would you say that.</i>

08:11.055 --> 08:14.057
Well, he's earned his reputation.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.193
As have you.

08:16.227 --> 08:20.030
Where were you on the
night of the fire?

08:21.465 --> 08:23.166
I was at home with Junia.

08:23.167 --> 08:25.235
She can vouch for me.

08:25.236 --> 08:28.704
<i>And who will vouch for her?</i>

08:28.705 --> 08:30.906
Excuse me?

08:31.008 --> 08:34.210
There isn't anything about
her that would make us

08:34.211 --> 08:38.481
doubt her word as your alibi, is there?

08:39.850 --> 08:43.118
What sort of man are you

08:43.254 --> 08:46.689
that you think it's appropriate to
come to my dear friend's viewing

08:46.690 --> 08:49.659
<i>and insult me and my girl?</i>

08:51.327 --> 08:53.829
From now on, if you'd like
to ask some questions,

08:53.896 --> 08:58.200
you will do so at the
proper time and place.

08:58.201 --> 09:01.603
Watch yourself, Detective.

09:01.704 --> 09:05.474
One call and I can have you
back walking a night beat

09:05.575 --> 09:08.710
in whatever filthy mick
neighborhood you come from.

09:11.013 --> 09:14.615
We'll let you know how the
investigation progresses.

09:14.616 --> 09:16.650
Excuse me.

09:27.196 --> 09:29.497
You go in and see your mother yet?

09:32.401 --> 09:35.403
Opal is keeping her company.

09:35.437 --> 09:37.938
What are you gonna
tell her about that eye?

09:39.774 --> 09:41.942
Kicked by a horse?

09:41.943 --> 09:43.576
My boy?

09:44.913 --> 09:47.080
What did happen?

10:02.664 --> 10:04.632
(sighs) A fight.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.533
Another one?

10:08.569 --> 10:10.570
It was inevitable.

10:10.571 --> 10:13.107
It always is with you.

10:13.108 --> 10:15.442
How bad is it?

10:19.648 --> 10:21.614
Bad.

10:23.952 --> 10:27.054
The good captain gave you everything.

10:28.356 --> 10:30.189
There's not a Negro in this city

10:30.190 --> 10:31.824
who's had more opportunities than you.

10:31.825 --> 10:34.393
Even that's not enough.

10:34.427 --> 10:36.963
What do you have to be so angry about?

10:36.964 --> 10:39.098
I'm angry for you.

10:39.099 --> 10:41.500
<i>(footsteps)</i>

10:52.046 --> 10:54.180
I used to...

10:56.116 --> 10:59.785
I used to sit down in the
stables and do my homework

10:59.787 --> 11:02.588
while you tended the horses.

11:05.125 --> 11:08.760
<i>There wasn't a subject that
you couldn't help me with.</i>

11:11.298 --> 11:13.631
<i>Smartest man I ever knew.</i>

11:17.036 --> 11:19.871
<i>You could have been something more.</i>

11:19.872 --> 11:21.506
<i>Something great.</i>

11:22.675 --> 11:25.276
Not just another man's coachman.

11:27.914 --> 11:30.415
I am angry.

11:30.516 --> 11:34.552
I'm angry that they made you
turn your eyes to the ground.

11:34.587 --> 11:37.722
And then they made you
too scared to look up.

11:38.891 --> 11:43.561
Boy, you have no idea what I've seen.

11:45.331 --> 11:48.433
If I hadn't learned to turn to God,

11:48.434 --> 11:50.168
I wouldn't be here

11:50.169 --> 11:52.504
and neither would you.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.177
<i>(hammering)</i>

12:00.178 --> 12:02.579
<i>(footsteps)</i>

12:05.416 --> 12:07.785
Got another batch of
intestines for you.

12:07.786 --> 12:09.519
(sighs)

12:09.520 --> 12:11.388
<i>Jewed the butcher down.</i>

12:11.389 --> 12:13.757
<i>Saved us nearly a fin.</i>

12:15.593 --> 12:17.561
<i>He offered me some sausages,</i>

12:17.729 --> 12:20.469
<i>but I can't really look at encased
meats the same way anymore.</i>

12:22.033 --> 12:23.700
<i>What's the matter?</i>

12:23.701 --> 12:25.970
- Where is it?
- <i>Where's what?</i>

12:25.971 --> 12:29.106
The money. All that we earned.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.944
There was over $300 profit
in that this morning.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.280
You've got me.

12:37.282 --> 12:39.683
- I took it.
- You had no right.

12:39.751 --> 12:41.885
- I made an investment.
- Investment in what?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.420
- Another damn wrestler?
- In us.

12:43.421 --> 12:45.822
- What do you mean, in us?
- Harry!

12:45.823 --> 12:48.424
- What are you doing?
- Rose.

12:48.459 --> 12:50.560
- What are you doing?
- I am a man...

12:50.662 --> 12:52.629
- You can't be doing this.
- ...what knows what he wants.

12:52.630 --> 12:54.330
Thomas, please, get up.

12:54.432 --> 12:56.531
I've known that we were good
together from the very start.

12:56.667 --> 12:57.401
Please get up.

12:57.426 --> 12:59.602
I have had feelings for
you for a very long time

12:59.603 --> 13:01.737
and that hasn't changed.

13:04.107 --> 13:06.374
I love you, Rose Dolan.

13:06.410 --> 13:10.545
<i>I'd be honored if you'd be my wife.</i>

13:14.250 --> 13:16.418
Are you gonna say something?

13:17.521 --> 13:18.654
You're off your nut.

13:18.755 --> 13:21.991
I am as sane as any man has ever been.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.960
- I can't.
- Why can't you?

13:24.961 --> 13:26.962
Because I can't.

13:26.963 --> 13:29.764
Harry, please.

13:29.833 --> 13:33.468
Just give... give me a chance.
What can I do?

13:33.469 --> 13:35.637
While you're down there, pray.

13:49.185 --> 13:50.852
A bit more.

13:52.121 --> 13:55.356
More. Stop. Good.

13:55.391 --> 13:58.526
So, which one of you
has more experience

13:58.527 --> 14:00.695
administering my spinal block?

14:00.730 --> 14:03.297
I've done it several times
with good success.

14:03.298 --> 14:05.232
Then you do it.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.669
Now, it was difficult to
tell from Zinberg's scope

14:07.670 --> 14:09.470
just how much pus might be present

14:09.505 --> 14:11.906
and if there's more than
one necrotic section.

14:12.007 --> 14:14.308
Well, we'll just have to
have plenty of saline ready

14:14.309 --> 14:16.844
in case I need to flush it out.

14:16.845 --> 14:18.512
In case <i>you</i> need it?

14:18.513 --> 14:20.381
I'll be performing the surgery.

14:20.382 --> 14:22.183
On yourself?

14:22.184 --> 14:25.052
- And we'll be...
- Assisting.

14:25.053 --> 14:27.020
Thack, that's madness.

14:27.155 --> 14:30.157
No, what's madness is using ether
regardless of the dangers.

14:30.192 --> 14:31.859
I'm gonna prove we don't need to use it

14:31.860 --> 14:33.927
and I want people to pay attention.

14:34.062 --> 14:36.963
Bertie: <i>And you think a circus
stunt is the way to do it?</i>

14:37.031 --> 14:39.432
Well, you'll watch and
so will everyone else.

14:39.501 --> 14:42.803
You'll read the journal
and the newspaper story.

14:42.837 --> 14:45.205
You'd risk your life for publicity?

14:45.239 --> 14:48.408
If it means saving people's lives, yes.

14:48.410 --> 14:50.777
But from your position on the table,

14:50.879 --> 14:53.280
you won't have the proper angles
to see what you're doing.

14:53.281 --> 14:55.181
That's what the mirror is for.

14:55.248 --> 14:57.817
So you're gonna perform it
backwards, essentially?

15:00.387 --> 15:03.355
Thack, this is a routine
surgery if you'd let us do it.

15:03.390 --> 15:05.257
We can have it done
in a half hour's time.

15:05.258 --> 15:07.894
And people will still
be etherizing and killing.

15:07.895 --> 15:10.062
It's overwhelmingly safe.

15:10.063 --> 15:11.797
That's what I told Abby.

15:11.865 --> 15:13.933
There could have been
other factors at play.

15:13.967 --> 15:15.801
She could have had
a defect in her heart

15:15.802 --> 15:18.870
or taken some medicine that
reacted poorly with the ether.

15:18.871 --> 15:21.439
All the more reason to avoid it.

15:22.742 --> 15:24.242
I'm not gonna help you kill yourself.

15:24.243 --> 15:26.044
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

15:26.078 --> 15:28.046
Self-surgery has been tried before.

15:28.147 --> 15:30.715
Well, then, at least allow us
to handle the tricky parts.

15:30.716 --> 15:33.217
No. It's very simple.

15:33.218 --> 15:35.353
You either do it my way

15:35.455 --> 15:38.689
or you can excuse yourselves
and I'll go it alone.

15:45.730 --> 15:47.265
Habershorn: <i>We still
haven't gotten the report</i>

15:47.266 --> 15:49.467
<i>from the insurance company.</i>

15:49.601 --> 15:52.636
<i>They told me they believe the
fire was intentionally set.</i>

15:52.637 --> 15:54.472
Barrow: <i>Sounds a bit far-fetched.</i>

15:54.473 --> 15:57.341
I think they'll find it's more likely

15:57.443 --> 15:59.777
the result of all the cost
cutting and speeding up

15:59.778 --> 16:02.313
our new architect was doing.

16:02.348 --> 16:05.149
Never a problem before he was hired on.

16:05.284 --> 16:08.986
It does seem that this disaster
coincided with his arrival.

16:08.988 --> 16:11.189
I've already got a list of new men

16:11.190 --> 16:13.524
whom I have personally vetted.

16:13.625 --> 16:17.861
Restarting this project
will be my highest priority.

16:17.963 --> 16:21.731
I'm truly not interested
in the cause at this point.

16:23.535 --> 16:26.837
In fact, I met with the
insurance company myself

16:26.838 --> 16:28.705
about it this morning

16:28.773 --> 16:31.141
<i>and negotiated a very
favorable settlement.</i>

16:31.309 --> 16:33.969
Habershorn: <i>Why would you do
that before getting the report?</i>

16:35.346 --> 16:38.182
Henry: <i>Because my family is
finished with this endeavor.</i>

16:38.316 --> 16:41.218
<i>I'm pulling the plug and we're
going to use the settlement</i>

16:41.219 --> 16:43.487
<i>to pay back the donors.</i>

16:43.488 --> 16:45.556
Henry, your father...

16:45.557 --> 16:47.691
My father is dead.

16:50.061 --> 16:52.896
So is his dream.

16:52.897 --> 16:55.465
Mr. Habershorn,

16:55.466 --> 16:57.701
if you're interested,

16:57.735 --> 16:59.268
I'd be willing to sell
you back your land

16:59.303 --> 17:01.671
at the full price
to do with what you wish.

17:01.839 --> 17:06.175
I've received a letter of interest
from the Mount Sinai people.

17:06.243 --> 17:10.246
I suppose I'll have no
choice but to sell to them.

17:10.348 --> 17:13.250
That's sure to lose me some
friends on the Upper East Side.

17:13.251 --> 17:16.953
But what's to become of this place?

17:17.021 --> 17:19.722
I don't want to tell you
your business, Henry,

17:19.723 --> 17:21.624
but I feel I owe it to your father

17:21.692 --> 17:23.527
to provide my wise
counsel at this time.

17:23.528 --> 17:25.895
No, you don't.

17:25.896 --> 17:29.131
I'll keep my own counsel from now on.

17:29.166 --> 17:32.300
Gentlemen, my sister
has always believed

17:32.402 --> 17:35.671
in the good this place does
for the people down here.

17:35.672 --> 17:38.440
And the need is only increasing.

17:38.442 --> 17:42.010
Therefore, I have asked Mayor Van Wyck

17:42.079 --> 17:44.547
<i>to consider having the
city take over the Knick.</i>

17:44.548 --> 17:46.314
Hear, hear.

17:47.951 --> 17:50.686
This is a terrible mistake.

18:05.402 --> 18:07.702
Have you heard the news?

18:07.703 --> 18:10.170
They're not going to rebuild.

18:11.773 --> 18:14.542
We won't see a penny
of that settlement.

18:14.577 --> 18:16.911
That is Henry Robertson's business.

18:16.912 --> 18:19.246
Oh, is it, really?

18:19.248 --> 18:23.951
You have a sizable reputation

18:23.986 --> 18:27.087
and you'll be trapped
on this sinking ship.

18:27.156 --> 18:30.891
They're talking about
having the city take over.

18:30.925 --> 18:34.761
Thack, that new hospital
was to be yours.

18:34.795 --> 18:38.432
It was being built around your genius.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.736
We cannot let that
juvenile decide our fate.

18:42.737 --> 18:45.739
Now, we find a way to continue on

18:45.773 --> 18:48.274
and get you what you
rightfully deserve.

18:50.145 --> 18:53.746
Did you know I'm a full member
of the Metropolitan Club now?

18:54.681 --> 18:56.582
I have very powerful friends.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.617
- Bully for you.
- Indeed.

19:00.086 --> 19:04.757
What about the
Thackery-Barrow Sanitarium?

19:04.758 --> 19:06.358
Hmm?

19:06.360 --> 19:07.760
All of the work you've been doing

19:07.761 --> 19:11.196
with those drunks and the like...

19:11.198 --> 19:13.731
I could have you up to the club.

19:13.767 --> 19:17.435
We could put together a presentation.

19:17.436 --> 19:19.237
We could get funding.

19:19.338 --> 19:23.776
Look, I have nothing to offer
the drunks and the drugged.

19:23.777 --> 19:25.711
I failed.

19:25.712 --> 19:28.080
So we'll leave that part out.

19:31.317 --> 19:33.785
Flowers keep getting
delivered every few minutes.

19:35.855 --> 19:38.190
Downstairs looks like
a botanical garden.

19:40.192 --> 19:42.326
Your father really was beloved.

19:51.403 --> 19:53.071
Phillip.

19:53.072 --> 19:55.772
Yes?

19:55.808 --> 19:58.810
I know I've taken you for granted

19:58.811 --> 20:01.112
and I shouldn't have.

20:02.715 --> 20:05.583
I think a fresh start

20:05.584 --> 20:08.552
in Ohio is what we need.

20:08.553 --> 20:11.121
You'll come with me?

20:11.189 --> 20:14.191
We'll get my mother off
to Newport with Henry,

20:14.192 --> 20:18.228
and then we'll head west.

20:29.573 --> 20:31.407
You'll make a fine oilman's wife.

20:31.408 --> 20:33.910
I'll certainly try.

20:37.215 --> 20:40.516
And you're sure Henry doesn't
need you at Robertson Shipping?

20:40.517 --> 20:42.752
Well, I thought so,

20:42.853 --> 20:45.320
but Henry's done an
excellent job of stepping in

20:45.422 --> 20:47.790
and reassuring the whole
company they're in good hands.

20:47.791 --> 20:51.561
The ships still sail, the passengers
and cargo are still en route.

20:53.130 --> 20:55.565
I don't envy Henry.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.100
Having to learn the whole
business so suddenly.

20:58.135 --> 21:00.335
Well, he's got a good
grip on the routes

21:00.437 --> 21:03.573
and he's been in charge of
the ports for years now.

21:03.641 --> 21:07.609
I thought he only worked
on the routes and contracts.

21:07.610 --> 21:09.644
Oh, no.

21:09.712 --> 21:12.013
No, overseeing the ports
was the first thing

21:12.082 --> 21:14.616
Henry wrested away from your
father when he started.

21:14.785 --> 21:18.820
Felt there were a great deal of savings
to be had if handled correctly.

21:18.922 --> 21:21.957
Did the same thing when we
were out in San Francisco.

21:21.992 --> 21:24.926
Turns out your brother
is quite the wharf rat.

21:27.130 --> 21:29.431
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

21:37.139 --> 21:38.572
Tuggle: Mr. Barrow.

21:38.573 --> 21:40.608
Oh, for Christ's sake.

21:42.744 --> 21:45.280
A few more questions if you don't mind.

21:45.281 --> 21:47.115
I do mind.

21:47.149 --> 21:49.017
Perhaps you'd like
to shake my hand first.

21:49.018 --> 21:50.651
No, thank you.

21:51.853 --> 21:55.790
So... why did you set the fire?

21:55.791 --> 21:59.026
Insurance? Revenge?

21:59.027 --> 22:01.962
I had nothing to do with that fire.

22:01.963 --> 22:03.631
Nothing, God damn it.

22:04.966 --> 22:07.000
This how the police operate now?

22:07.001 --> 22:10.270
Accosting a man with accusations

22:10.339 --> 22:13.107
in the sanctity of the
bathroom of his own club?

22:14.175 --> 22:16.610
You keep trying to impress me,

22:16.644 --> 22:19.313
but I don't impress as easily as you

22:19.314 --> 22:20.813
or your kind.

22:20.815 --> 22:23.183
Perhaps this will impress you.

22:23.284 --> 22:26.919
I hope you're enjoying your
last day as a detective.

22:27.688 --> 22:29.857
I'm starting to.

22:29.858 --> 22:32.025
That new apartment of yours,

22:32.026 --> 22:34.861
you paid in cash, right?

22:34.863 --> 22:37.663
A lot of money for a man on a salary.

22:37.664 --> 22:39.798
Not for one who works hard

22:39.799 --> 22:41.500
and saves judiciously.

22:41.501 --> 22:43.135
If you have any further questions,

22:43.136 --> 22:44.871
you can refer them to my attorney.

22:44.872 --> 22:46.572
You have one?

22:46.573 --> 22:48.307
I will soon.

22:48.308 --> 22:50.243
This interview is over.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.378
Get out now.

22:52.379 --> 22:54.346
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

23:03.656 --> 23:05.691
Sorry about that.

23:05.692 --> 23:09.527
This man has no sense of decency.

23:09.662 --> 23:13.264
Well, that's the problem with
all of this fairness talk.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.602
Everyone thinks they can speak
to anyone however they wish.

23:17.670 --> 23:19.772
He wants to make a
splash with a big fish

23:19.773 --> 23:21.639
and apparently I'm it.

23:23.442 --> 23:27.212
And what was this clown's name?

23:28.114 --> 23:30.015
His name was Tuggle.

23:30.016 --> 23:32.483
Tuggle.

23:56.775 --> 23:59.777
Neely.

23:59.778 --> 24:01.813
I wasn't expecting you.

24:01.814 --> 24:03.948
I know you weren't.

24:03.949 --> 24:07.117
I know what you did

24:07.118 --> 24:09.686
behind our father's back.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.392
My investment in the subway.

24:15.393 --> 24:16.927
Yeah.

24:16.928 --> 24:19.763
<i>It's hardly a secret now.</i>

24:19.897 --> 24:24.601
<i>Well, it looks like it's going
to be a roaring success.</i>

24:24.769 --> 24:25.320
No.

24:25.345 --> 24:26.972
<i>A fortune I will happily
share with the entire family.</i>

24:26.972 --> 24:30.074
I know what you did.

24:30.075 --> 24:32.476
What did I do?

24:32.477 --> 24:34.845
The bribes at the ports

24:34.846 --> 24:37.448
to the inspectors.

24:37.449 --> 24:39.483
It was you

24:39.584 --> 24:43.520
who let all those sick
passengers into the country.

24:43.621 --> 24:47.156
You who brought the plague
here and to San Francisco.

24:47.157 --> 24:49.793
- You who killed Speight.
- <i>Neely.</i>

24:49.794 --> 24:52.095
You who murdered your own father

24:52.096 --> 24:54.664
and tried to kill me.

24:57.267 --> 24:59.135
Say something.

25:02.974 --> 25:05.008
It's a shame you're not a man.

25:07.945 --> 25:11.480
You'd have been named lead
detective in the city by now.

25:12.550 --> 25:14.117
How could you?

25:14.118 --> 25:16.119
How could I not?

25:19.490 --> 25:22.025
Banks turning their backs on us.

25:22.026 --> 25:25.027
Creditors bleeding us dry.

25:25.162 --> 25:29.332
He was so consumed with his damn
legacy, we were going broke.

25:29.366 --> 25:32.168
It was his fortune to lose, not yours.

25:32.169 --> 25:33.636
He built it.

25:33.637 --> 25:36.139
And he was squandering it.

25:36.140 --> 25:38.207
Like a fool.

25:39.910 --> 25:42.110
I saved him from that.

25:43.647 --> 25:45.747
He's a titan again because of me.

25:45.748 --> 25:48.016
You're making me sick.

25:48.017 --> 25:50.318
<i>He had to go.</i>

25:54.257 --> 25:56.425
It's as much your fault as it is mine.

25:56.426 --> 25:59.161
How?

25:59.162 --> 26:01.929
You told him

26:01.931 --> 26:06.100
about your little investigation.

26:06.102 --> 26:09.003
He'd have figured it out it was me.

26:09.071 --> 26:13.273
He'd gone soft in his old
age, but not so soft

26:13.375 --> 26:16.109
that he wouldn't have kicked
me out of the business

26:16.244 --> 26:20.313
and written me out of his will
like that for having done it.

26:22.884 --> 26:24.551
You left me no choice.

26:24.586 --> 26:28.055
Don't you dare try and
lay this at my feet.

26:28.056 --> 26:30.557
You took what you wanted.

26:30.592 --> 26:34.728
And now I'm legally
in control of the family

26:34.729 --> 26:37.698
and all our holdings.

26:37.699 --> 26:39.766
We'll see about that.

26:42.136 --> 26:44.571
What will you do?

26:44.572 --> 26:47.240
Go to the police.

26:47.241 --> 26:49.242
Tell the newspapers.

26:49.243 --> 26:50.644
Tell Mother.

26:50.645 --> 26:53.546
No, you won't.

26:55.483 --> 26:58.885
What evidence is there, hmm?

26:58.886 --> 27:00.754
You gave me everything you have.

27:00.755 --> 27:02.222
The fire?

27:02.256 --> 27:05.291
Well, I've already taken care of that.

27:05.292 --> 27:09.095
It's only your word against mine

27:09.096 --> 27:12.364
and no one's gonna listen

27:12.432 --> 27:14.900
to the rantings of a
distraught housewife.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.141
Neely...

27:22.142 --> 27:25.477
you have an easy, comfortable life.

27:26.513 --> 27:28.147
Go live it.

27:28.148 --> 27:31.583
Be a good wife.

27:31.584 --> 27:33.918
Start a charity.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.920
Be impregnated...

27:35.921 --> 27:38.523
by your husband.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.959
Name the firstborn
after our departed father.

27:43.095 --> 27:47.332
But you will do exactly as I say...

27:48.701 --> 27:51.603
or you won't make it
back to your carriage.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.506
You're a monster.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.708
(crying)

27:56.709 --> 28:00.678
And your one-woman crusade is over.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.682
Is that understood?

28:07.819 --> 28:09.487
Go.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.834
Lucy.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.035
Hello, Cornelia.

28:29.540 --> 28:33.643
I am so glad you're here.

28:33.644 --> 28:36.045
So glad you saw things my way.

28:42.353 --> 28:45.422
Is Cornelia coming up to
Newport with us as well?

28:45.423 --> 28:47.656
Afraid not.

28:47.657 --> 28:49.725
Right, Neely Doll?

28:51.061 --> 28:53.829
But tell Phillip I
expect all the Showalters

28:53.864 --> 28:56.165
up to the house for Independence Day.

28:56.233 --> 28:58.867
Show them what a real
fireworks display looks like.

29:01.404 --> 29:05.174
Should have had Wingo killed
when I had the chance.

29:05.209 --> 29:08.410
A real man takes care
of his own business.

29:08.411 --> 29:11.514
I am a real man, Junia.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.848
I would delight in choking the life

29:13.850 --> 29:15.583
out of that vindictive little fairy

29:15.684 --> 29:18.386
if the police weren't following
me everywhere I went.

29:18.387 --> 29:19.955
Look out this window.

29:19.956 --> 29:22.090
Our view of the park

29:22.091 --> 29:24.692
is now policemen on a bench.

29:26.028 --> 29:27.462
They mean to arrest me.

29:27.463 --> 29:30.698
I know they do.
They want to destroy me.

29:30.699 --> 29:33.634
- What about me?
- What about you?

29:33.636 --> 29:36.804
Will I be put out onto the streets?

29:36.805 --> 29:38.405
I wouldn't put it past them

29:38.439 --> 29:41.208
to seize this place, the bloodsuckers.

29:41.209 --> 29:43.944
You'd let them do that to me?

29:43.945 --> 29:46.413
What will I do? Where will I go?

29:47.415 --> 29:49.150
I don't know.

29:49.151 --> 29:51.251
I don't know.

29:53.121 --> 29:57.724
Anything in my name can be seized.

29:58.893 --> 30:01.060
Even Effie can make a claim for it

30:01.061 --> 30:02.929
since we're still married.

30:04.799 --> 30:07.267
This place.

30:07.268 --> 30:10.070
This place is my only hope.

30:12.407 --> 30:15.575
<i>Listen, if they take me,</i>

30:15.642 --> 30:18.477
<i>I'm going to need a loan
against this property</i>

30:18.478 --> 30:21.379
<i>to pay for my defense.</i>

30:21.415 --> 30:24.382
Well, I don't know how to do that.

31:06.893 --> 31:09.594
Evening.

31:09.695 --> 31:11.662
Priest: How long has it been
since your last confession?

31:11.663 --> 31:13.997
Longer than you'd care to know.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.869
<i>There's no point in going
through all my wrongs.</i>

31:17.870 --> 31:21.572
<i>Besides, God's already seen them.</i>

31:21.639 --> 31:25.576
<i>They ain't all bad,
you got to understand.</i>

31:25.677 --> 31:29.513
<i>I take the sick to the
hospital lickety-split.</i>

31:29.514 --> 31:32.483
<i>Save one every now and then.</i>

31:32.517 --> 31:35.987
<i>All I'm saying is I'm
an all right fella.</i>

31:35.988 --> 31:37.554
<i>I know I am.</i>

31:37.555 --> 31:40.258
Priest: <i>Then why are you here?</i>

31:40.259 --> 31:42.193
<i>(Cleary sighs)</i>

31:42.194 --> 31:43.960
<i>Love.</i>

31:45.530 --> 31:48.665
<i>I asked a woman to be my wife.</i>

31:49.534 --> 31:51.702
<i>She's hesitating.</i>

31:53.405 --> 31:57.040
<i>Maybe she senses something.</i>

31:57.041 --> 31:58.742
<i>Figuring maybe I need to confess</i>

31:58.743 --> 32:00.911
<i>before God lets her say yes.</i>

32:00.912 --> 32:04.347
<i>See, me and her,</i>

32:04.382 --> 32:08.018
<i>a ways back, we worked together.</i>

32:08.085 --> 32:10.721
<i>That's when I started
having feelings for her.</i>

32:10.789 --> 32:14.758
<i>And I know she was having
feelings for me, too.</i>

32:15.693 --> 32:17.894
<i>But there was no way
that I could, uh...</i>

32:19.296 --> 32:21.464
<i>make her my own</i>

32:21.465 --> 32:23.265
<i>seeing as how she was...</i>

32:25.402 --> 32:27.569
<i>married to the Church and all.</i>

32:28.872 --> 32:32.074
<i>Then I figured a way out.</i>

32:32.075 --> 32:34.076
<i>I set her up.</i>

32:34.077 --> 32:37.079
Priest: You set her up?

32:37.147 --> 32:40.215
Cleary: <i>Told a copper I
knew what she was up to</i>

32:40.216 --> 32:42.885
<i>and he set a trap for her.</i>

32:42.953 --> 32:46.288
<i>I knew the Church wouldn't
look too kindly on it.</i>

32:46.289 --> 32:48.157
<i>And you didn't.</i>

32:48.158 --> 32:50.326
<i>Took away her habit, her name.</i>

32:50.327 --> 32:52.527
<i>Banished her.</i>

32:52.595 --> 32:55.864
<i>Left her with nothing
and nobody except me.</i>

32:55.932 --> 32:58.399
Priest: You manipulated a
nun's excommunication?

32:58.400 --> 33:00.802
She was a fucking abortionist!

33:02.438 --> 33:05.539
I know you read about it.

33:05.575 --> 33:07.809
You gonna start defending her now, hmm?

33:09.979 --> 33:13.014
I did you all a fucking favor.

33:13.148 --> 33:16.217
Now, I didn't see the law coming
down as hard as it did on her.

33:16.251 --> 33:17.952
That surprised me, I can tell you.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.789
That hurt me something terrible

33:20.790 --> 33:23.624
to see her so broken.

33:23.626 --> 33:27.028
But I got her out of that trouble.

33:27.029 --> 33:30.498
She's better now.

33:30.499 --> 33:32.633
Happier than I ever seen.

33:32.634 --> 33:34.835
Happier than when she was a f...

33:34.836 --> 33:37.938
nun, that's for sure.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.009
Priest: What exactly is it you
want forgiveness for, then?

33:41.010 --> 33:44.778
No, no. Not forgiveness.

33:44.779 --> 33:47.948
I guess just a prayer or something

33:47.983 --> 33:52.020
so God can get her to
accept me as her husband,

33:52.021 --> 33:54.855
admit that she loves me, too.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.860
So we ain't alone anymore.

34:12.005 --> 34:14.040
Fuck it.

34:24.217 --> 34:27.485
Man: Where would you like to go?

34:27.487 --> 34:29.722
I... I don't know.

34:29.723 --> 34:32.592
Europe? South America?

34:32.592 --> 34:34.493
The Orient?

34:41.034 --> 34:43.469
How far will that take me?

34:46.505 --> 34:48.873
What about Australia?

34:54.246 --> 34:58.283
Junia, it shouldn't come to this.

34:58.285 --> 35:01.553
I've been told it won't come to this,

35:01.588 --> 35:05.424
but I'm being cautious
for your protection.

35:05.425 --> 35:07.025
Thank you, Hermie.

35:17.803 --> 35:19.837
Good.

35:19.905 --> 35:23.073
And this is for the loan
against the apartment.

35:23.109 --> 35:25.910
And this money will be
in your bank account.

35:28.114 --> 35:32.950
And this money is for your lawyer.

35:32.985 --> 35:36.454
Ezekiel Marshall of Martin,
Burt, and Marshall.

35:36.455 --> 35:39.023
Yes. Very good.

35:40.559 --> 35:43.660
And this, lastly, is
the power of attorney.

35:43.661 --> 35:46.296
Sign right here.

35:46.297 --> 35:48.264
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

37:08.043 --> 37:10.144
<i>(grunts)</i>

37:27.262 --> 37:31.065
(both chuckle)

37:46.214 --> 37:47.914
All right.

37:47.915 --> 37:49.983
(both laugh)

37:50.017 --> 37:52.385
All right. All right. All right.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.835
<i>(men chatting)</i>

38:19.045 --> 38:21.781
Well, that does me, gentlemen.

38:23.884 --> 38:27.252
Pardon me, Mr. Barrow, sir.

38:28.054 --> 38:30.290
Ah.

38:30.291 --> 38:32.091
What is it?

38:32.092 --> 38:35.927
I wanted to apologize

38:35.929 --> 38:38.930
for my behavior earlier, sir.

38:40.300 --> 38:44.569
The fire is being ruled an accident.

38:44.570 --> 38:46.138
Hmm.

38:46.139 --> 38:49.108
An electrical accident.

38:49.109 --> 38:52.111
My superiors wanted me to come here

38:52.112 --> 38:55.780
and tell you personally.

38:58.484 --> 39:01.086
Well, thank you, Detective.

39:01.087 --> 39:03.355
Apology accepted.

39:03.356 --> 39:05.389
Now good day.

39:08.594 --> 39:10.796
(chuckles)

39:10.797 --> 39:12.364
Your deal, Barrow.

39:12.365 --> 39:14.932
Ah, yes.

39:14.934 --> 39:17.202
What is wrong with your hands?

39:17.203 --> 39:18.837
No idea.

39:18.838 --> 39:22.906
They've felt odd lately.

39:22.975 --> 39:25.443
I thought I'd have one
of my doctors check me.

39:25.510 --> 39:28.046
Well, have an X-ray done.
Get to the bottom of it.

39:28.047 --> 39:29.848
They're miraculous.

39:29.849 --> 39:33.184
Oh, I know. (chuckles)

39:33.185 --> 39:35.419
I've had dozens of them.

39:39.124 --> 39:40.992
Phelps: <i>I want to take
our message on the road.</i>

39:40.993 --> 39:43.393
Rather than follow Europe,

39:43.394 --> 39:45.128
I want to lead them for a change.

39:45.129 --> 39:47.597
Bring eugenics to the continent.

39:47.732 --> 39:50.800
Teach them a little something about
American scientific discovery.

39:50.869 --> 39:54.304
Precisely. And who better
to deliver that message

39:54.372 --> 39:57.407
than a strong, handsome
man such as yourself?

39:57.408 --> 39:59.042
I'm flattered, but...

39:59.043 --> 40:00.877
But what?

40:01.012 --> 40:04.246
You'd prefer to stay here and
be the subordinate to a Negro?

40:04.314 --> 40:07.183
And to the man who chose
that Negro over you?

40:07.251 --> 40:09.919
I was considering searching
for another position.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.188
Well, you've found it.

40:12.189 --> 40:14.256
We'd travel first class.

40:14.258 --> 40:16.292
You'd be paid for your speeches

40:16.326 --> 40:18.427
and there'd be a generous stipend.

40:18.495 --> 40:22.698
This is a message that
needs to be spread.

40:22.732 --> 40:24.433
And there are a lot of wealthy people

40:24.434 --> 40:27.736
who are willing to fund such an effort.

40:27.737 --> 40:29.871
We'd be away for at least a year.

40:32.341 --> 40:34.075
Would I be able to bring a companion?

40:34.076 --> 40:36.311
Of course.

40:36.379 --> 40:39.581
You're not giving me a lot
of reasons to say no.

40:39.582 --> 40:42.117
Well, that was my intention.

40:42.184 --> 40:45.353
You'd be the traveling
prophet of eugenics.

40:45.454 --> 40:48.889
An evangelist for the
preservation of the human race.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.727
When would we leave?

40:52.728 --> 40:54.562
First of the month.

40:54.596 --> 40:57.932
We'd take the White Star
and start in Germany.

40:57.934 --> 41:00.268
As good a place as any, I suppose.

42:15.710 --> 42:17.976
Gentlemen.

42:18.045 --> 42:20.613
Please direct your attention
to the center of the ring,

42:20.680 --> 42:23.081
where I will amaze you with
a feat so extraordinary,

42:23.117 --> 42:25.017
it has never been seen before by you

42:25.052 --> 42:27.620
or anyone else in the
history of mankind.

42:29.823 --> 42:31.424
I have come to believe
that our use of ether

42:31.458 --> 42:34.126
is both cavalier and irresponsible.

42:35.829 --> 42:38.530
The drug is risky and overused,

42:38.631 --> 42:41.033
and I will prove today that
a man can be operated on

42:41.034 --> 42:43.201
with no general anesthesia

42:43.202 --> 42:45.570
and that that same man

42:45.571 --> 42:49.541
can perform the operation himself.

42:49.542 --> 42:51.676
(men murmuring)

42:51.677 --> 42:53.277
Dr. Gallinger and Dr. Chickering

42:53.312 --> 42:56.081
are injecting me with
a 2% cocaine solution

42:56.082 --> 42:58.115
directly into my spinal canal,

42:58.151 --> 43:00.551
which will block all signals of pain

43:00.552 --> 43:03.854
from my lower half to my upper.

43:03.888 --> 43:08.325
This is a technique I pioneered myself

43:08.360 --> 43:11.595
and one I know to be completely safe

43:11.596 --> 43:13.364
if done correctly.

43:16.101 --> 43:18.402
How are you gentlemen doing back there?

43:18.403 --> 43:20.371
Just fine.

43:20.372 --> 43:22.538
When you assembled here,

43:22.606 --> 43:25.375
see today what can be done
without general anesthesia,

43:25.409 --> 43:27.910
I have no doubt that
we will all look back

43:28.011 --> 43:32.882
and realize how many lives
were saved on this day.

43:33.784 --> 43:36.419
Hold still, please.

43:55.305 --> 43:57.071
Scalpel.

44:10.886 --> 44:13.087
As I work through
several layers of dermis,

44:13.223 --> 44:15.490
Nurse Baker will follow along
with the electric cauterizer.

44:15.491 --> 44:16.957
Nurse.

44:16.958 --> 44:18.626
Thack, at least allow us to do that.

44:18.627 --> 44:21.562
As you can see, I will only
let the nurses assist me

44:21.563 --> 44:23.096
as I don't want to be accused

44:23.165 --> 44:27.835
of not having performed
the entire procedure myself.

44:27.902 --> 44:30.604
A high-wire walker is
only thrilling to watch

44:30.672 --> 44:35.243
if there's no net below
to save him from disaster.

44:35.244 --> 44:36.577
Nurse Pell, retractors.

44:57.532 --> 45:01.701
As I work my way through the...

45:01.702 --> 45:04.403
intestine,

45:04.437 --> 45:07.373
it seems there are
several necrotic areas

45:07.374 --> 45:10.276
which will need resecting.

45:10.277 --> 45:12.345
Six by my count.

45:14.148 --> 45:16.315
<i>Much worse than originally assumed.</i>

45:16.316 --> 45:18.784
Dr. Thackery, perhaps you could resect

45:18.852 --> 45:21.320
one or two of the sections
to prove your point,

45:21.354 --> 45:23.389
then Dr. Gallinger
and I can continue on.

45:23.490 --> 45:25.825
Or you could close and we
could reconsider our options.

45:25.826 --> 45:28.894
Thank you, doctors, but I
will finish what I started.

45:28.895 --> 45:30.928
The show must go on. Clamp.

45:40.472 --> 45:42.640
Clamp.

46:15.607 --> 46:18.074
The first two-inch section
has been removed.

46:18.075 --> 46:20.943
Before I sew the ends together,

46:20.945 --> 46:25.548
I will try to remove the next section.

46:35.025 --> 46:37.960
As you can see, this particular area

46:37.962 --> 46:40.596
<i>is much more difficult to access.</i>

46:40.697 --> 46:43.077
- He's cutting too close to the superior...
- I know.

46:46.803 --> 46:48.837
Bertie.

46:51.375 --> 46:54.042
He's working too closely
to the superior mesenteric.

46:54.043 --> 46:56.445
I know. Dr. Thackery...

46:56.446 --> 46:58.346
Your unsolicited opinion is noted,

46:58.448 --> 47:01.784
but this tack is the only
way to get to this section.

47:04.954 --> 47:06.789
- Fuck!
- Gallinger: <i>You've cut yourself.</i>

47:06.790 --> 47:08.322
Jaeger's needle and silk.

47:08.424 --> 47:10.724
- Bertie: <i>Just clamp it off.</i>
- Thackery: <i>Stay back!</i>

47:12.795 --> 47:18.032
Seems like I've nicked
the abdominal aorta.

47:45.627 --> 47:49.429
My peripheral vision
seems to be dulling a bit.

47:51.533 --> 47:53.834
Almost...

47:53.835 --> 47:56.469
a vibration at the edges.

48:01.443 --> 48:03.943
Body temperature has begun to drop.

48:19.125 --> 48:20.793
This is it.

48:27.234 --> 48:29.434
This is all we are.

48:54.027 --> 48:55.860
Clamp that aorta, Bertie.

48:57.197 --> 48:58.697
Gallinger: <i>Suction.</i>

49:02.102 --> 49:03.935
- Clamped.
- Edwards: Lips are blue.

49:04.003 --> 49:05.770
Gallinger: Fingernails, too.
Let's get him down.

49:05.772 --> 49:08.339
- Pell: <i>No pulse.</i>
<i>- Gallinger: Shit!</i>

49:12.344 --> 49:14.645
- Tube's in.
- Almost got it sewn.

49:18.283 --> 49:20.050
- Anything?
- No.

49:20.051 --> 49:22.252
Come on, damn it.

49:22.253 --> 49:23.887
Where are you going?

49:39.570 --> 49:42.105
Come on.

49:48.079 --> 49:50.780
(men murmuring)

51:01.950 --> 51:05.852
Henry: <i>I read your letter on
the train down from Newport.</i>

51:15.063 --> 51:17.498
If that's what you want to do,

51:17.499 --> 51:19.800
it's your inheritance.

51:21.802 --> 51:23.470
And I'll gladly pitch in as well.

51:23.471 --> 51:25.071
No, you don't have to.

51:25.073 --> 51:28.842
I want to. It seems a noble cause.

51:29.877 --> 51:33.580
And it's only money, right?

51:33.581 --> 51:35.482
(chuckles)

51:36.918 --> 51:38.985
Thank you, Henry.

51:42.056 --> 51:45.058
With my eye likely gone,
I'll need another vocation.

51:48.262 --> 51:51.164
Are there even any patients
left on that ward?

51:51.231 --> 51:54.333
By all accounts, it was
a failed experiment.

51:54.334 --> 51:56.302
It's worth further study.

51:58.505 --> 52:00.907
I owe him at least that.

52:43.048 --> 52:46.217
This is not the way the lady did it.

52:48.553 --> 52:51.288
How did she do it?

52:51.289 --> 52:53.090
I never look at her.

52:56.662 --> 52:59.130
Is that what you would prefer?

52:59.131 --> 53:00.932
I think so.

53:15.680 --> 53:17.881
How are you feeling?

53:18.916 --> 53:20.317
Not so good.

53:20.318 --> 53:22.753
I can't sleep.

53:22.754 --> 53:24.655
I could give you something.

53:25.624 --> 53:27.458
I don't want to sleep.

53:27.459 --> 53:30.060
I'm having bad dreams.

53:35.367 --> 53:37.568
Really?

53:47.845 --> 53:50.113
Tell me about them.

53:51.327 --> 53:58.665
