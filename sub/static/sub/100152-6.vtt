WEBVTT

00:25.692 --> 00:27.486
Gentlemen, I hope I'm not intruding.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.197
Oh, lookie here, boys.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.784
Gene Kranz,
the new director of Johnson Space Center,

00:33.867 --> 00:36.370
deigns to visit us common working stiffs.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.206
I thought what the hell,
I'll drop by and say farewell.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.708
Plus,
I wanted to personally congratulate you

00:41.792 --> 00:44.461
on finally getting a command of your own,
Mike. You earned it.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.588
I appreciate that, Gene.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.174
Hey, listen,
you tell Neil that I guarantee

00:49.258 --> 00:52.010
we'll do a better job of landing
than he and Buzz.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.180
I think everyone did a better job
of landing than he and Buzz.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.808
Gentlemen, Godspeed.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.650
<i>Houston,
this is Cape Kennedy Launch Control.</i>

01:07.442 --> 01:11.530
<i>We are approaching T minus one hour
ten minutes and that's a hold.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:14.283
<i>Scheduled hold for flight handoff.</i>

01:14.366 --> 01:17.035
Copy that, Kennedy. Holding at one hour
and ten minutes for flight handoff.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.745
CAPCOM,
do you have our settlers on the line?

01:18.829 --> 01:19.872
I do indeed, Deke.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.875
<i>Jamestown Base, this is Houston.
Patching you into the big board.</i>

01:22.958 --> 01:24.501
<i>Do you read? Over.</i>

01:24.585 --> 01:27.254
<i>Houston, this is Jamestown Base.
We read you.</i>

01:27.337 --> 01:29.882
<i>You better not start
the festivities without us.</i>

01:29.965 --> 01:31.425
Wouldn't dream of it, Ed.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.969
Administrator Weisner is
just getting his speech out now.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.930
<i>Harry's doing the speech?
This is gonna take hours.</i>

01:37.764 --> 01:41.059
I'll keep it brief, Gordo.
I know you have a short attention span.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.981
This is a big day.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.900
An important day for our country.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.485
A day a lot of people said
would never come.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.280
But it's also a big day here at NASA.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.742
And it is only proper that
we should recognize it as an important one

01:56.825 --> 01:58.535
in the annals of our program.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.454
Because today

02:00.954 --> 02:04.625
a woman becomes one of our
flight directors for the very first time.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.086
She earned her place at this desk

02:08.169 --> 02:12.799
through her dedication and commitment
to the highest standards of this program.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.053
By the depth of her technical
and professional knowledge.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.515
But most of all,
by the leadership she demonstrated

02:19.598 --> 02:21.850
during the establishment
of Jamestown Base.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.978
Her ability is unquestioned.

02:25.521 --> 02:29.233
Her character and integrity are
of the highest order.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.986
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of President Kennedy,

02:33.612 --> 02:35.948
it is my honor and privilege
to present to you

02:36.031 --> 02:39.993
our new White Team flight director
for the launch of Apollo 23,

02:40.869 --> 02:41.995
Irene Hendricks.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.881
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, all.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.218
I can only say
that I stand on the shoulders of giants.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.222
And I'm proud to lead this group
of exceptional professionals.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.976
Now, let's get back to work.
We've got a mission to launch.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.193
I want those ascent trajectory updates,
please.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.528
Let's go.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.780
<i>And Irene, now that you're in charge,</i>

03:16.864 --> 03:19.324
<i>we've got a few bones
we'd like to pick with you.</i>

03:20.158 --> 03:21.451
<i>Like the shower.</i>

03:21.535 --> 03:22.703
<i>And the food.</i>

03:23.078 --> 03:25.455
<i>And the defective thermal ice drill bits.</i>

03:25.539 --> 03:26.540
<i>And the food.</i>

03:26.623 --> 03:30.711
<i>And about 5,000 other things
we'd love to hand over to Apollo 23</i>

03:30.794 --> 03:32.254
<i>when they get here next week.</i>

03:32.337 --> 03:33.672
Okay, guys. Message received.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.216
And I'll be happy to
take all your complaints

03:36.300 --> 03:38.260
as soon as we get this bird up
and on its way to the moon.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.763
<i>That bird was supposed to get here
two weeks ago.</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:44.850
<i>Day one, already behind, Irene.</i>

03:44.933 --> 03:47.436
I'm gonna file your complaint
in the appropriate receptacle, Gordo.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.314
-Charlie, let's cut that video feed, okay?
-Yes, ma'am.

03:50.981 --> 03:54.943
<i>But now we leave our coverage
of Apollo 23 at the hold point</i>

03:55.360 --> 03:57.821
<i>to return to our special report.</i>

03:57.905 --> 03:59.615
<i>We are down to the final minutes</i>

03:59.698 --> 04:04.369
<i>in the vote to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment in the Illinois State Senate,</i>

04:04.453 --> 04:06.663
<i>and the tally is very close.</i>

04:07.414 --> 04:11.877
<i>Passage of the ERA was declared
a top priority of President Ted Kennedy</i>

04:11.960 --> 04:13.837
<i>in his inaugural speech,</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:17.257
<i>and the last two years
have seen a flurry of activity</i>

04:17.341 --> 04:20.344
<i>as his administration
put on a full-court press</i>

04:20.427 --> 04:23.055
<i>in statehouses around the country.</i>

04:23.639 --> 04:27.726
<i>As of today,
36 states have ratified the amendment,</i>

04:27.809 --> 04:30.312
<i>leaving it only one state shy.</i>

04:30.395 --> 04:33.774
<i>Supporters had actually written off
the state of Illinois</i>

04:33.857 --> 04:38.195
<i>until Republican Governor Ogilvie,
in a surprising turn,</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:41.573
<i>threw his support
behind the amendment early last year...</i>

04:41.657 --> 04:43.033
Yes, I knew it!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.035
<i>...which has created
something of a political...</i>

04:45.118 --> 04:46.370
<i>Just a moment.</i>

04:46.745 --> 04:52.459
<i>And I'm getting word
that the final vote is being cast now.</i>

04:53.043 --> 04:54.419
<i>And the vote...</i>

04:54.920 --> 04:56.088
<i>is yea.</i>

05:13.438 --> 05:15.232
I think we're looking at a bad actuator.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.484
Should only be a few minutes
before we swap it out,

05:17.568 --> 05:18.777
and then we'll clear the tower.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.029
I got nowhere to be.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.950
It's a beautiful machine.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.791
I hold in my hand
the prime crew of Apollo 24.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.753
Why do I get the feeling there's a reason
you're keeping me in suspense?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.673
Don't know what you're talking about.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.634
The astronauts are,
in ranking of seniority...

05:43.677 --> 05:46.555
Ellen Waverly, mission commander,

05:47.264 --> 05:49.474
Harrison Liu, and...

05:54.104 --> 05:55.647
Deke Slayton.

05:55.731 --> 05:56.773
What?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.651
Come on, Deke. What are you doing?

05:59.735 --> 06:03.322
My medical clearance for flight status,
signed, sealed and delivered.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.868
You've had a heart condition
since Mercury. Everyone knows that.

06:07.951 --> 06:12.247
Which has officially been noted as no
longer a flight risk by the medical staff.

06:12.331 --> 06:15.000
As attested to in the document
in your hand.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.752
The president isn't gonna like this.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.046
He's gonna think
it's some kinda publicity stunt.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.798
He can argue with the flight surgeon
if he doesn't like it.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.593
And as chief of the astronaut office,

06:24.676 --> 06:29.640
I'm assigning Deke Slayton
to prime crew on Apollo 24.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.644
Far as I'm concerned,
that's the final word.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.272
Jesus.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.734
I know this must be
very disturbing to hear.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.278
Well, I mean this is completely
unacceptable behavior.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.448
I can assure you they both
will be severely punished for it.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.992
I think I'm not that concerned
with their punishment per se.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.662
I'm more interested in getting
to the emotional roots

06:51.745 --> 06:53.413
of this kind of antisocial behavior.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.415
Antisocial? Well...

06:55.499 --> 06:56.917
They're not psychopaths.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.877
They blew up some toilets
with cherry bombs.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.088
It's a prank,
and they'll be punished for it.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.339
I think we need to explore

07:02.422 --> 07:05.759
whether there are issues at home
that might be underlying this.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.303
And I would really like to include
Mrs. Stevens in these discussions,

07:08.387 --> 07:10.013
since her son is one of the boys involved.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.600
Well, Mrs. Stevens is unable to attend,
due to the demands of her job.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.311
Yes, she's an astronaut.
I'm aware of that.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.230
As is her husband,

07:18.689 --> 07:21.692
and my husband, both of whom are
on the moon at this moment.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.569
I'm aware of that too, Mrs. Baldwin.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.781
And I can only imagine the stresses and
strains that must put on both families.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.074
Oh, we manage.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.618
Thank you
for bringing this to my attention.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.912
I can assure you,
I will handle it from here.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.122
-Well...
-Thank you.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.957
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Baldwin.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.712
Not a word out of either one of you
until we are home.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.173
And then we will discuss
the appropriate consequences

07:44.256 --> 07:45.883
for the vandalization of school property.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.384
Let's go.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.927
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.644
I wish I could see my dad's face today.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.730
Last Thanksgiving, we had a huge fight

07:59.813 --> 08:02.149
about whether ERA meant
we'd all have to use the same bathrooms.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.317
Well, it'd be a lot cleaner.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.529
John Stennis is gonna fight
the whole "women in combat" thing

08:07.613 --> 08:09.698
on the Armed Forces Committee,
just you watch.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.201
He may be a Democrat,
but he's still from Mississippi.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.620
Well, Mississippi, California, whatever.

08:14.995 --> 08:19.208
No way Americans are gonna watch their
daughters march off to war, believe me.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.377
Used to say that about women in space too.

08:22.461 --> 08:23.837
It's all just a matter of time.

08:26.507 --> 08:30.010
It's the Equal Rights Amendment, Pam,
not the Gay Rights Amendment.

08:31.011 --> 08:35.057
You can both be as cynical as you like,
but the winds of change are blowing.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.313
Actuator swap-out and test is complete.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.232
We're closing up and exiting the tower.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.443
I'll check in when we reach the LCC.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.446
I'm hungry.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.907
Do they still have those double-decker
cheeseburgers...

08:53.534 --> 08:55.244
FIDO,
do we have updates on launch winds yet?

08:55.327 --> 08:57.412
Yes, Flight.
Just got the balloon data from the Cape.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.915
-We're within launch parameters.
-Keep an eye on the data.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.876
Last flight we came close
to exceeding angle of attack limits.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.510
Oh, my God.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.805
-Oh, no.
-I'm not sure. I'm just seeing it now too.

09:30.863 --> 09:31.864
Lock the doors.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.904
<i>Sixty days have now passed</i>

10:53.987 --> 10:57.533
<i>since the shocking explosion of Apollo 23</i>

10:57.824 --> 11:00.202
<i>on the launchpad at Cape Kennedy.</i>

11:00.285 --> 11:03.038
<i>The tragic deaths of 12 members
of the ground crew</i>

11:03.121 --> 11:05.040
<i>caught in the tower during the explosion,</i>

11:05.123 --> 11:08.919
<i>including Gene Kranz, the newly appointed
director of Johnson Space Center,</i>

11:09.002 --> 11:12.714
<i>continue to cast a pall
over the entire program and the nation.</i>

11:12.798 --> 11:16.468
<i>The three astronauts who were
pulled away from the exploding vehicle</i>

11:16.552 --> 11:19.346
<i>by the emergency launch escape tower</i>

11:19.429 --> 11:21.932
<i>are still recovering
from injuries sustained</i>

11:22.015 --> 11:27.020
<i>when their damaged command module
landed on the beach instead of the ocean.</i>

11:27.563 --> 11:30.482
<i>Meanwhile, the three astronauts stranded
in the Jamestown Base</i>

11:30.566 --> 11:32.985
<i>continue to do experiments
and do maintenance work</i>

11:33.068 --> 11:36.071
<i>on America's first manned habitat
on the moon.</i>

11:36.154 --> 11:40.158
<i>Astronauts Baldwin, Stevens and Poole
have been receiving resupply provisions</i>

11:40.242 --> 11:43.912
<i>via unmanned Titan rockets while
they wait for NASA's board of inquiry</i>

11:43.996 --> 11:46.331
<i>to identify the cause
of the Saturn V explosion.</i>

11:46.832 --> 11:48.792
<i>But there can be no relief crew
for the astronauts</i>

11:48.876 --> 11:53.130
<i>until the board certifies the fleet of
Saturn rockets ready to fly once again.</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:57.217
The FBI continues to be concerned
at the possibility

11:57.301 --> 12:01.972
that KGB operatives
might have sabotaged Apollo 23

12:02.848 --> 12:05.684
as a way of delaying work
on the Jamestown Base.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.353
To that end,
we would like to begin interviews

12:08.437 --> 12:11.356
with some of your support personnel
here at JSC

12:11.440 --> 12:15.360
and at NASA facilities at Cape Kennedy,
JPL, and around the country.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.198
-I understand.
-I don't.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.660
All due respect, but why is
the FBI still going down this rabbit hole?

12:23.994 --> 12:28.999
We know the cause.
And it wasn't some Russian secret agent.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.792
You think you know the cause.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.504
And our investigation's already turned up

12:33.587 --> 12:38.050
numerous instances of breaches of
security protocol at NASA facilities,

12:38.133 --> 12:39.927
any one of which could have allowed
Soviet agents

12:40.010 --> 12:42.012
access to highly classified information

12:42.095 --> 12:45.224
on the future military expansion
of the Jamestown Base.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.308
All right.

12:46.391 --> 12:52.940
Special Agent Donahue has been given
wide latitude by the Department of Justice

12:53.774 --> 12:58.111
to follow any lead that could be related
to security breaches here at NASA,

12:58.195 --> 13:03.867
and I'm sure the entire board of inquiry
will give him full cooperation.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.869
Thank you all for coming.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.997
Can't wait to leave all this behind.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.207
Got an extra seat?

13:26.723 --> 13:27.933
Weisner's looking for ya.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.022
Great.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.985
Gotta look at that every day now, huh?

13:38.068 --> 13:39.236
Keeps his memory alive.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.737
No, it doesn't.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.531
You know what it does?

13:42.614 --> 13:45.200
It says just how insignificant
we are in this room.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.035
What's that supposed to mean?

13:47.494 --> 13:48.871
If an astronaut had died on that pad,

13:48.954 --> 13:51.748
there'd be a hell of a lot more
than a plaque and a picture.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.460
After Apollo 1,
you couldn't turn on a television

13:55.544 --> 13:58.463
or look at a magazine
or newspaper for months

13:58.547 --> 14:00.966
without seeing the faces of those guys.

14:01.884 --> 14:05.179
Like "American heroes."
"Best of the best."

14:06.054 --> 14:07.890
"The nation mourns."

14:09.433 --> 14:10.976
But one of us dies,

14:11.560 --> 14:14.354
one of the faceless,
nameless grunts in Mission Control,

14:14.438 --> 14:16.315
and it's picture and a plaque

14:16.398 --> 14:20.569
and then back to <i>Happy Days</i>
and <i>Six Million Dollar Man</i>.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.781
Those other 11 guys who died with Gene?
You know who they are?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.409
They're just the other 11 guys.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.583
Have you been drinking, Bill?

14:35.709 --> 14:39.004
I'm not on duty.
And it's none of your goddamn business.

15:09.368 --> 15:10.619
How'd you get in here?

15:11.828 --> 15:14.831
Oh, sorry. My father let me in.

15:15.207 --> 15:19.044
Octavio Rosales? He's one of the janitors.

15:19.628 --> 15:23.131
Oh, Octavio. Yeah, I know who that is.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.343
He talked to one of the security guards
who said it was okay.

15:26.885 --> 15:27.886
Did he?

15:38.021 --> 15:40.858
Logarithms. Hated those.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.652
They're not too difficult.

15:44.862 --> 15:45.863
Not yet.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.168
You wanted to see me, Mr. Weisner?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.003
Have a seat, Miss Madison.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.724
The board of inquiry would like you to
collect an outside report

16:13.807 --> 16:16.226
that was prepared on the Saturn explosion
and bring it to us.

16:17.186 --> 16:18.854
What do you mean by "collect"?

16:19.313 --> 16:22.357
Exactly that.
Collect the report and bring it to us.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.281
So, I'm a messenger now?
It's one thing to be passed over,

16:29.364 --> 16:32.451
but I didn't count on being demoted
to the mail room.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.787
Miss Madison, we've talked about that.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.582
Irene Hendricks was
the most qualified person

16:38.665 --> 16:40.501
to become White Team flight director...

16:40.584 --> 16:42.920
Even though she's been with the agency
for less than five years,

16:43.003 --> 16:45.964
while I started at NASA in 1966.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.926
I'm sorry. Really, I am.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.637
But I'm afraid the book is closed
on that subject.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.265
Fine. But I'm not a messenger.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.229
This is a delicate situation.

17:02.022 --> 17:05.025
Two months ago,
the board asked an outside expert

17:05.108 --> 17:08.487
to conduct a thorough analysis
of the entire Saturn program.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.656
Someone who could provide an overview

17:10.739 --> 17:13.742
of the development and operational systems

17:13.825 --> 17:16.244
and give us a unique perspective.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.914
Now that analysis is finished.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.040
Word on the street is
you have convincing evidence

17:21.124 --> 17:25.546
that metal fatigue in the second stage
LH2 fill-drain valve caused a leak,

17:25.628 --> 17:26.880
leading to the explosion.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.637
I dislike gossip.

17:35.389 --> 17:38.267
But in this case, the rumors are true.

17:39.184 --> 17:43.021
We're ready to restart the Saturn
production line and correct the flaw,

17:43.272 --> 17:44.898
but the existing fleet of rockets

17:44.982 --> 17:47.609
will have to be taken apart
and repaired before they can be flown.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.572
So, you can imagine the urgency
for the board to issue its recommendations

17:51.655 --> 17:53.490
and get Saturn flying again.

17:54.867 --> 17:58.495
All we need is
this last systems analysis report.

18:00.497 --> 18:04.334
Why can't this outside expert
just mail in his findings?

18:04.418 --> 18:07.629
Or have one of your flunkies
go pick it up?

18:09.548 --> 18:12.384
He will only give the report to you.

18:17.639 --> 18:18.807
No.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.267
He won't give it to anyone else.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.394
I don't wanna see him.

18:22.477 --> 18:26.773
This isn't personal. He built
the Saturn V, and we need his analysis.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.612
The man is a war criminal.
He should be prosecuted...

18:31.695 --> 18:33.488
That is your opinion.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.992
And it is not one that is shared
by the majority of the board.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.287
We need the report prepared
by Dr. von Braun,

18:40.370 --> 18:43.415
and he has informed us
that he will only give it to you.

18:44.166 --> 18:47.961
So, I'm afraid that I'm going to have
to ask you to go and get it for us.

18:57.304 --> 19:02.893
<i>The Soviet Union announced today
that its own moon base, called Zvezda,</i>

19:02.976 --> 19:07.022
<i>has received its first crew
of three cosmonauts</i>

19:07.105 --> 19:09.316
<i>and is now fully operational.</i>

19:09.858 --> 19:14.488
<i>The Zvezda Base, also situated
on the rim of Shackleton Crater,</i>

19:14.571 --> 19:18.659
<i>is eight miles northwest
of the American Jamestown Base.</i>

19:18.742 --> 19:20.827
<i>Today marks the first time</i>

19:20.911 --> 19:23.956
<i>when crews from the USSR and the US</i>

19:24.039 --> 19:26.708
<i>are on the lunar surface at the same time.</i>

19:27.918 --> 19:30.295
<i>It would be a profound mistake to</i>

19:30.379 --> 19:31.463
<i>allow our boys</i>

19:31.547 --> 19:33.715
<i>to communicate with
the Soviets on the moon...</i>

19:33.799 --> 19:34.633
<i>...Mr. President.</i>

19:34.925 --> 19:35.759
<i>I, uh...</i>

19:35.843 --> 19:37.678
<i>certainly understand
your point of view, and...</i>

19:37.761 --> 19:39.847
<i>I appreciate the advice...</i>

19:39.930 --> 19:42.015
<i>but that's not really
the purpose of my call.</i>

19:42.307 --> 19:43.767
<i>I want to let you know...</i>

19:43.851 --> 19:46.353
<i>that I've decided to pardon you</i>

19:46.436 --> 19:48.397
<i>for all crimes
that you may have committed</i>

19:48.480 --> 19:50.274
<i>in connection with the Watergate break-in.</i>

19:50.357 --> 19:51.191
<i>You what?</i>

19:51.275 --> 19:53.735
<i>I've decided it's in the best interest
of the nation</i>

19:54.027 --> 19:56.822
<i>not to prosecute
former political opponents</i>

19:56.905 --> 19:58.240
<i>in the criminal justice system.</i>

19:58.323 --> 20:00.409
<i>Don't get on your high horse with me.</i>

20:00.492 --> 20:02.077
<i>I don't want your fucking pardon.</i>

20:02.160 --> 20:04.037
<i>I don't need your permission, Dick.</i>

20:04.121 --> 20:05.038
<i>It's a done deal.</i>

20:05.497 --> 20:07.165
<i>You better watch yourself, Teddy.</i>

20:07.916 --> 20:09.543
<i>Maybe spend a little less time in</i>

20:10.002 --> 20:11.753
<i>Palm Beach.</i>

20:25.100 --> 20:27.144
<i>I put a deposit on that apartment.</i>

20:28.395 --> 20:29.521
You what?

20:29.605 --> 20:31.440
<i>Gordo, we talked about this.</i>

20:33.901 --> 20:37.863
I thought we agreed to wait till I got
back before we took any big steps.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.616
<i>Oh, it's just a deposit.</i>

20:42.492 --> 20:44.536
<i>You didn't tell the boys, right?</i>

20:44.620 --> 20:47.956
No, of course not.
Of course not, that's...

20:48.916 --> 20:50.876
that's something
we'll have to do together.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.129
<i>I don't know, Trace.</i>

20:55.214 --> 20:57.382
<i>I just think
you're jumping ahead of things.</i>

20:58.300 --> 21:00.427
<i>They don't even know
when we're getting back from here.</i>

21:00.886 --> 21:03.096
I know.
That's why I didn't want to lose it.

21:03.180 --> 21:06.141
<i>I mean, it's a great price,
perfect location,</i>

21:06.225 --> 21:09.978
<i>it's near the boys' school,
our house, even JSC.</i>

21:10.562 --> 21:12.689
Then why don't you move into it then?

21:13.190 --> 21:16.485
<i>Oh, so you and Sheila can finally have
the house to yourselves?</i>

21:16.568 --> 21:20.781
<i>Like I would ever lay a hand on Sheila.
She can't even cook.</i>

21:23.492 --> 21:24.493
Wow.

21:30.082 --> 21:34.586
Hey. You think there's any way
you could smuggle another bottle

21:34.670 --> 21:36.755
onto the next resupply rocket?

21:38.841 --> 21:41.176
<i>Not... a... chance.</i>

21:41.927 --> 21:44.179
<i>I couldn't get near a resupply rocket.</i>

21:44.263 --> 21:45.931
<i>New security rules.</i>

21:47.015 --> 21:50.018
<i>The FBI's everywhere
looking for commies under the bed.</i>

21:50.102 --> 21:51.353
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

21:54.481 --> 21:56.108
<i>Hey. What is that?</i>

21:57.317 --> 21:59.027
No. Gordo, what's that noise?

22:00.070 --> 22:01.530
-<i>Noise?</i>
-Yeah.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.785
<i>Dani's taking a shower.</i>

22:07.411 --> 22:10.372
Well, don't forget to wash her back.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.291
<i>I don't wanna screw Danielle.</i>

22:14.585 --> 22:15.627
Okay?

22:18.255 --> 22:20.090
<i>It's great talking to you, Gordo.</i>

22:21.508 --> 22:23.802
<i>I'll see you next time.</i>

22:39.026 --> 22:40.319
Trouble in paradise?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.489
Sorry, Dani.

22:44.573 --> 22:46.909
Don't worry, Gordo.
I don't wanna screw you either.

22:51.872 --> 22:54.082
Should go apartment hunting up here.

22:58.170 --> 23:02.591
As you know, the FBI is assisting
with the investigation

23:02.674 --> 23:05.177
into the Saturn V accident.

23:06.637 --> 23:10.557
I was hoping you might be able
to answer a few questions for me.

23:11.141 --> 23:12.142
Sure.

23:16.104 --> 23:21.568
Mr. Wilson, are you familiar with an area
of Houston called the Montrose District?

23:22.486 --> 23:24.821
Yeah, it's downtown, isn't it?

23:25.155 --> 23:26.490
That's right.

23:29.201 --> 23:31.078
Do you frequent that area?

23:31.411 --> 23:34.915
Have any relatives or friends
in that area?

23:35.415 --> 23:37.835
No. It's not really my scene.

23:40.003 --> 23:44.383
So, you've never been to an establishment
called the Bayou Landing?

23:47.678 --> 23:48.762
Don't think so.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.515
The Bayou Landing is a dance hall.

23:52.766 --> 23:53.767
Okay.

23:54.685 --> 23:56.228
For homosexuals.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.066
Is that right?

24:02.818 --> 24:05.404
We've had it under surveillance
for a few months now.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.031
The whole neighborhood
is turning into a hotbed

24:08.115 --> 24:10.701
for radicals and communist sympathizers.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.327
Lots of European types.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.329
Bikers, artists...

24:15.539 --> 24:17.541
militant homosexuals.

24:17.833 --> 24:18.876
In Houston?

24:22.379 --> 24:26.133
An anonymous source reported seeing
someone matching your description

24:26.216 --> 24:28.635
entering the establishment
last Saturday...

24:29.761 --> 24:30.846
around 1:00 a.m.

24:32.014 --> 24:33.849
Now, do you have any recollection of that?

24:36.602 --> 24:38.228
Me? No.

24:44.359 --> 24:45.652
I'm a Republican.

24:46.737 --> 24:47.905
And a Methodist.

24:49.323 --> 24:54.119
Don't hang out with a lot of bikers,
artists, or militant homosexuals.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.040
And where were you?

24:58.123 --> 24:59.333
Last Saturday?

25:00.876 --> 25:02.002
Home in bed.

25:02.461 --> 25:03.587
Can you prove that?

25:05.672 --> 25:06.798
Ask my girlfriend.

25:09.426 --> 25:10.427
That would be...

25:14.723 --> 25:16.016
Ellen Waverly.

25:16.850 --> 25:17.976
Dating three years.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.191
Three years is an awfully long time.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.445
Most girls would've dragged a man
down the aisle by now.

25:28.529 --> 25:31.532
Well, Ellen's not most girls.

25:32.366 --> 25:36.370
Besides, it's hard to save for a ring
on a government salary.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.498
I'm sure you can understand.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.459
I think I do.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.133
This guy is trouble.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.345
I've sailed through
50 security clearances.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.888
I know these guys.

25:55.556 --> 25:56.557
And this one...

26:00.060 --> 26:05.858
This one is just dying to find
a coven of little NASA fairies to bust.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.527
Why does he care so much?

26:09.486 --> 26:11.697
The feds see it as a security risk.

26:12.865 --> 26:15.826
If you have a secret,
the Russians can use it to blackmail you.

26:17.661 --> 26:20.122
He'll be talking to you eventually,

26:20.205 --> 26:21.999
and he's gonna be looking
for ways to trip you up.

26:22.082 --> 26:24.001
Don't believe anything he tells you.

26:28.589 --> 26:31.675
I can't believe this. Well, isn't...

26:33.302 --> 26:38.056
Isn't lying to the FBI a crime?
Am I gonna be committing a felony here?

26:38.432 --> 26:39.933
Yes, you are.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.853
It's that, or...

26:44.313 --> 26:45.647
you can tell them the truth.

26:46.607 --> 26:48.609
And get us both shitcanned outta NASA

26:48.692 --> 26:51.278
and held up as degenerate perverts
before the whole world.

26:59.119 --> 27:03.165
Okay, I better get our story straight.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.335
Where was our first date?

27:51.380 --> 27:52.756
Come in, won't you?

28:15.445 --> 28:18.699
All right, I'm here. I don't know
what it is you want, but I'm here.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.035
Did you go by your house?

28:22.661 --> 28:28.000
The new owners have let the front yard
become quite... untidy.

28:28.834 --> 28:31.503
-Please.
-Not everyone can afford a gardener.

28:32.671 --> 28:36.300
Yours needs to do a better paint job
on the mailbox.

28:38.177 --> 28:40.429
Your father never used a gardener.
Not once.

28:41.889 --> 28:44.641
He kept it up himself,
all the way to the very end.

28:44.725 --> 28:46.310
He took pride in that.

28:49.354 --> 28:52.774
He was... a good man, your father.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.028
Please tell me we're not here
to talk about my father.

28:56.111 --> 29:00.741
I tried to talk to you at his funeral,
but you left without a word.

29:01.241 --> 29:02.492
I had work.

29:04.036 --> 29:05.370
Now, what's this about?

29:09.249 --> 29:10.292
My dinner.

29:11.084 --> 29:14.838
Anna left me one of her casseroles
before she took Josef to Disney World.

29:14.922 --> 29:16.048
Have you been?

29:16.548 --> 29:19.426
Walt's vision is extraordinary.
A great man.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.929
Such a shame he did not live to see it.

29:22.012 --> 29:23.680
I'm not staying for dinner.

29:23.764 --> 29:26.058
I believe I have a good burgundy
to go with it.

29:41.949 --> 29:45.661
Hello? Any lost boys hereabouts?

29:45.744 --> 29:47.079
We're in here.

29:47.162 --> 29:49.122
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, sweetheart.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.209
What's this?

29:52.709 --> 29:53.710
Pinewood Derby.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.130
Pinewood Derby? Didn't y'all just do that?

29:57.631 --> 29:59.174
That was a year ago, Mom.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.011
-It's all right. Time flies, right?
-Yeah.

30:03.095 --> 30:04.513
Well, the race isn't for three weeks,

30:04.596 --> 30:07.349
but I told the boys if they want
to be ready, they better get started.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.309
Three weeks.

30:09.393 --> 30:10.519
On the 10th.

30:11.937 --> 30:13.856
I checked your schedule
with Deke's office.

30:13.939 --> 30:16.441
You'll be at Marshall
prepping your payload for 25,

30:16.525 --> 30:18.735
but I got it covered, all right?

30:18.819 --> 30:20.487
-Thank you.
-Of course.

30:20.571 --> 30:22.823
Hey, Shane,
you are gonna chop your arm off.

30:22.906 --> 30:25.826
Go and get the whetstone from your
father's toolbox and sharpen that knife.

30:25.909 --> 30:26.994
Yes, ma'am.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.164
Well, it's... That's great.

30:31.248 --> 30:33.250
Thank you for taking them
to the pack meeting.

30:33.667 --> 30:36.712
It was a den meeting, Mom.
Pack meetings are only once a month.

30:36.795 --> 30:37.921
Right.

30:38.255 --> 30:41.300
Hey, Danny, I think someone's
forgetting to tell his mom the big news.

30:44.386 --> 30:45.804
I finished my Arrow of Light badge.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.348
Get out of here. Really?

30:49.766 --> 30:52.436
Wow. I thought that took a long time.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.398
-Do you remember their den mother, Carol?
-Yeah.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.192
Yeah,
she said he finished all the requirements

30:58.275 --> 30:59.860
faster than she's ever seen anyone.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.361
I was proud of him.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.531
I'm proud of you too, Danny.

31:05.699 --> 31:08.452
I'm gonna tell your daddy
next time I talk to him, okay?

31:08.535 --> 31:09.536
Okay.

31:10.996 --> 31:14.124
I think we gotta get going.
Where's your brother? Where's Jimmy?

31:14.208 --> 31:17.920
Oh, he was exhausted, so I put him down
in Shane's bed. He's sleeping.

31:18.003 --> 31:19.004
Thanks.

31:20.047 --> 31:21.757
-Let's go, Son.
-Can I spend the night?

31:22.508 --> 31:25.177
Please. I really wanna work
on my racer with Shane.

31:25.844 --> 31:30.724
Oh, honey, I think Mrs. Baldwin
probably needs some quiet time.

31:31.767 --> 31:34.978
Trace, it's fine. It's all right.

31:35.062 --> 31:38.774
I mean, all the boys bunk together
anyway and so it's not really a problem.

31:39.316 --> 31:42.027
And, you know what, I'm making enchiladas.
You should stay for dinner.

31:42.945 --> 31:44.821
I'd love to...

31:49.201 --> 31:53.080
but I've got an early day tomorrow.

32:00.128 --> 32:03.131
You have fun.
And you mind your manners, all right?

32:03.632 --> 32:04.800
I love you.

32:09.263 --> 32:11.056
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. I'll see you soon.

32:20.816 --> 32:24.361
You have barely touched your food.
Anna will be hurt.

32:26.655 --> 32:28.240
Don't do that.

32:28.323 --> 32:30.951
Anna is a lovely, gentle woman,

32:31.034 --> 32:33.704
and I won't have you manipulate me
in her name.

32:34.204 --> 32:37.040
Why do you find it
so hard to simply talk to me?

32:38.834 --> 32:41.170
I've known you
practically your whole life.

32:41.962 --> 32:44.756
You learned how to play the piano
right over there.

32:48.427 --> 32:50.512
Peter came to Jesus and asked,

32:50.596 --> 32:55.184
"Lord, how many times shall I forgive
my brother when he sins against me?

32:55.267 --> 32:56.852
Up to seven times?"

32:56.935 --> 32:58.478
Jesus answered,

32:58.896 --> 33:03.817
"I tell you not seven times,
but 77 times."

33:04.318 --> 33:05.819
Is that what you want?

33:06.486 --> 33:08.030
Forgiveness, is that it?

33:08.363 --> 33:11.450
Okay.
I forgive you for all of your many sins.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.286
There. Are we done now?

33:15.704 --> 33:18.248
Can I have my report so I can go?

33:19.166 --> 33:22.085
I only want you to listen
so that I can tell you things.

33:22.169 --> 33:25.672
Important things
your father wanted you to know.

33:25.756 --> 33:27.216
Then why didn't he tell me himself?

33:28.509 --> 33:29.885
Why?

33:29.968 --> 33:32.679
That man had every opportunity
to tell me whatever he wanted.

33:33.305 --> 33:34.556
A whole lifetime.

33:35.224 --> 33:39.061
And now I'm supposed to hear some words
from beyond the grave delivered by...

33:44.024 --> 33:45.025
By...

33:47.319 --> 33:53.492
Margo, I only want to fulfill a promise
I made to a friend of many years.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.162
Will you allow me to do that?

34:05.003 --> 34:10.132
Your father and I met in the faculty
club bar in the spring of 1951.

34:10.217 --> 34:12.427
You had a lively debate
about Mozart and Strauss

34:12.511 --> 34:14.012
and a beautiful friendship was born.

34:14.096 --> 34:15.179
I know the story.

34:15.264 --> 34:17.139
He was a brilliant physicist.

34:17.891 --> 34:20.393
Uncommon insights
into the nature of matter.

34:21.311 --> 34:24.398
I tried to recruit him to work with me
on the Redstone rocket many times,

34:24.481 --> 34:26.775
but he always refused. Do you know why?

34:26.859 --> 34:29.152
Because he was a small man
with small ambitions.

34:29.235 --> 34:34.283
No.
He was a damaged man with broken dreams.

34:35.534 --> 34:37.911
This is what broke him.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.958
Now, I do not pretend to understand
his feelings about this,

34:43.041 --> 34:45.252
and I certainly did not share
his perspective,

34:45.335 --> 34:48.005
but I always respected him.

34:51.675 --> 34:55.012
He loved you very much. You were
the most important thing in his life...

34:55.094 --> 34:56.513
Don't do that.

34:56.847 --> 34:59.433
Don't try and polish up his act
now that he's gone.

34:59.516 --> 35:02.311
My whole life, he barely
gave me the time of day, and now,

35:02.394 --> 35:04.771
"You were the most important thing
in his life." Please.

35:04.855 --> 35:06.148
These are facts.

35:06.607 --> 35:09.067
Facts you did not have
when you were growing up.

35:09.151 --> 35:11.028
Facts which your father
did want you to have

35:11.111 --> 35:12.779
but could not find a way to tell you.

35:12.863 --> 35:17.117
To explain why he could
appear remote at times.

35:17.618 --> 35:20.537
"Remote at times"? "Remote"?

35:21.872 --> 35:23.665
You know what mattered to my father?

35:24.625 --> 35:26.084
His stamp collection.

35:27.127 --> 35:31.256
He'd come home at 5:30 every night
on the dot, have two martinis.

35:31.340 --> 35:34.343
Not one, not three, but two.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.428
And he'd then spend
the rest of the evening in his study

35:36.512 --> 35:39.515
with his records and his stamp collection.

35:40.641 --> 35:43.268
That was it.
That was his life, nothing else.

35:43.894 --> 35:46.855
Not my mother, not me. Nothing.

35:47.856 --> 35:49.691
When I graduated college,

35:50.192 --> 35:54.071
the first woman in my family
on either side, by the way,

35:54.530 --> 35:55.781
you know what he did?

35:58.325 --> 36:00.202
He gave me a desk calendar.

36:03.455 --> 36:06.083
That's how important I was to him.

36:07.042 --> 36:10.295
And now I'm supposed to feel bad
because he died a lonely old man?

36:10.379 --> 36:11.964
Well, I'm sorry.

36:12.047 --> 36:15.217
But isn't there something in your Bible
about reaping what you sow?

36:16.760 --> 36:17.970
Yes.

36:19.179 --> 36:22.099
And your father reaped the whirlwind.

36:25.853 --> 36:27.312
During the war...

36:29.523 --> 36:33.569
he did some very secret work
for the government.

36:33.652 --> 36:37.155
He worked on advanced radar systems
for the Army Air Corps.

36:38.156 --> 36:40.534
I know because my mother told me about it.

36:40.617 --> 36:43.287
She didn't tell you everything
because she didn't know.

36:43.829 --> 36:44.913
He told me only

36:44.997 --> 36:49.168
because I too had a top secret clearance
and was a man of science,

36:49.251 --> 36:53.422
so perhaps he felt
I could understand his experience.

36:54.214 --> 36:56.758
He started working on radar in 1942,

36:56.842 --> 36:59.887
but within the year, he was recruited
on something much bigger...

37:01.638 --> 37:03.056
by Robert Oppenheimer.

37:05.475 --> 37:08.145
Your father worked
on the Manhattan Project.

37:10.063 --> 37:11.273
That's not true.

37:11.356 --> 37:12.691
These are his files.

37:22.201 --> 37:26.246
He worked with John von Neumann
to devise a method

37:26.330 --> 37:30.042
whereby a plutonium core could be
compressed into a critical mass

37:30.125 --> 37:31.960
through a spherical implosion.

37:32.044 --> 37:34.963
It was brilliant work.

37:36.381 --> 37:38.091
Such complex calculations

37:38.175 --> 37:40.886
were thought outside the realm
of the possible when they began.

37:40.969 --> 37:46.892
Their work led directly to the creation
of the weapon that was used on Nagasaki.

37:47.518 --> 37:49.645
-Fat Man.
-Yes.

37:49.728 --> 37:53.690
The bombing had
a profound effect on your father.

37:54.399 --> 37:56.401
It shook him to his core.

37:57.694 --> 38:02.241
In retrospect, he felt as if he'd been
a participant in something horrific.

38:03.742 --> 38:05.118
Something evil.

38:08.580 --> 38:12.459
He and I discussed the moral ramifications
of the atomic bomb many times.

38:12.543 --> 38:16.338
I tried to tell him
that he had saved millions of lives

38:16.421 --> 38:18.215
by avoiding the invasion of Japan.

38:18.799 --> 38:20.592
He would not hear of it.

38:21.468 --> 38:23.178
He retreated from the world.

38:23.470 --> 38:25.931
And from you. Your mother.

38:26.682 --> 38:29.726
It was only at the end of his life
that he decided...

38:30.769 --> 38:32.479
you should know the truth.

38:34.606 --> 38:37.067
But he could not bring himself
to tell you.

38:37.985 --> 38:39.111
So...

38:41.697 --> 38:44.825
he asked me to tell you after he died.

39:22.613 --> 39:23.822
I've been thinking.

39:27.993 --> 39:32.331
Maybe we should take a break for a while.

39:35.459 --> 39:36.877
"Take a break"?

39:41.131 --> 39:43.467
This FBI thing has you all wound up,
doesn't it?

39:44.343 --> 39:45.344
Yeah.

39:49.723 --> 39:51.266
Something else?

39:51.725 --> 39:55.562
No, I mean, it's the FBI and...

39:58.899 --> 40:00.234
I don't know.

40:01.693 --> 40:02.861
Say it.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.576
I don't know where this is going.

40:11.703 --> 40:12.829
"This"?

40:17.626 --> 40:19.962
Oh, did you mean this?

40:21.672 --> 40:24.967
Well, I don't know.
Where would you like it to go?

40:27.344 --> 40:28.470
I don't know.

40:29.763 --> 40:34.810
I mean,
I'm not sure that it can go anywhere.

40:40.148 --> 40:41.567
And, you know, it...

40:43.277 --> 40:45.028
it could be just a...

40:46.530 --> 40:49.449
Just a phase.
Kissing girls is just a phase for you?

40:49.533 --> 40:50.826
Maybe.

40:56.206 --> 40:57.541
Yeah, I remember that.

40:58.917 --> 41:01.962
It was about eight or nine years ago.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.423
I thought it was just a phase.

41:04.506 --> 41:09.094
Something I'd do for a while
and then it'd pass.

41:13.140 --> 41:14.391
But it didn't.

41:16.476 --> 41:17.519
It's who I am.

41:18.604 --> 41:21.481
I know. I get that.

41:22.149 --> 41:25.235
But you still might what?
Are you gonna grow out of it, Ellen?

41:25.319 --> 41:27.279
No, it's not about growing out of it.

41:27.362 --> 41:28.822
I didn't say that. I'm just...

41:29.740 --> 41:31.408
It's all still very new to me.

41:31.491 --> 41:33.160
Sometimes it doesn't even seem
like it is me.

41:33.243 --> 41:34.870
Like I'm someone else when I'm with you.

41:37.873 --> 41:39.208
Well, so do I.

41:42.669 --> 41:45.881
I feel like someone different
when I'm with you.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.011
Does that scare you?

41:51.970 --> 41:52.971
No.

42:07.819 --> 42:09.404
May I keep this?

42:09.488 --> 42:10.656
Of course.

42:11.323 --> 42:12.366
Thank you.

42:13.116 --> 42:14.409
And thank you for...

42:16.828 --> 42:17.996
telling me.

42:22.501 --> 42:24.920
Now may I have your report so I can go?

42:26.004 --> 42:29.466
You will return tonight?
It's a long drive.

42:29.550 --> 42:31.218
-Perhaps you could stay.
-No.

42:33.595 --> 42:36.723
This... doesn't just...

42:38.642 --> 42:40.894
wipe everything away between us.

42:41.562 --> 42:44.523
Can't you see that?
What you did in the war...

42:45.983 --> 42:47.943
it's not the same as what my father did.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.070
A comparison I do not invite.

42:56.702 --> 42:58.745
Let us leave this acrimony.

42:59.621 --> 43:02.249
I saw your talent
when you were but a little girl.

43:03.041 --> 43:05.460
You remember?
You were struggling with geometry?

43:05.544 --> 43:06.753
Don't.

43:06.837 --> 43:09.631
I told you that mathematics
was like music.

43:11.091 --> 43:13.594
I will never forget the look on your face.

43:13.677 --> 43:14.803
Stop.

43:14.887 --> 43:17.431
When you started to take piano lessons,

43:17.514 --> 43:20.726
it was like the world
suddenly opened up to you.

43:21.852 --> 43:24.104
You began to see God's invisible strings

43:24.188 --> 43:26.982
and how they connected
all the constructs of the universe.

43:27.065 --> 43:28.525
I gave you that insight.

43:28.609 --> 43:32.237
I encouraged you, challenged you
and pushed you when your father could not.

43:32.321 --> 43:35.866
Could not... but wanted to.

43:37.326 --> 43:41.747
I appreciate all that. I do. Okay?

43:43.081 --> 43:44.249
Thank you.

43:45.834 --> 43:47.878
Is that enough?

43:50.631 --> 43:52.382
You are wasting your talent.

43:53.091 --> 43:55.260
Wasting your God-given gifts.

43:56.887 --> 43:59.973
-I've done pretty well.
-But not as well as Irene Hendricks.

44:01.433 --> 44:04.895
Yes, I do stay in touch
with what is happening back at the ranch.

44:08.649 --> 44:11.527
-I'll get there.
-Where? Flight director?

44:11.944 --> 44:14.530
What is your goal?
Where do you see yourself in ten years?

44:15.572 --> 44:18.659
In ten years, I'll be running NASA.

44:19.535 --> 44:21.203
No, you will not.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.623
Allow me to be blunt.

44:25.123 --> 44:28.752
You are not what is called
"a team player," Margo.

44:29.253 --> 44:30.838
You have many strengths.

44:30.921 --> 44:33.882
Intelligence, intuition,
cunning, determination.

44:33.966 --> 44:35.884
I'm part of the team in Mission Control.

44:35.968 --> 44:37.886
Because I was your mentor.

44:38.303 --> 44:42.933
And because the late Gene Kranz
looked kindly upon you.

44:43.517 --> 44:49.022
Nonetheless, now you have seniority,
experience, impeccable credentials.

44:49.106 --> 44:51.692
So why were you passed over
for flight director?

44:52.359 --> 44:53.402
Why?

44:54.069 --> 44:55.696
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

44:56.738 --> 44:58.991
It is because you do not play the game.

44:59.283 --> 45:04.037
You resist forming the social bonds
necessary to be seen as a team member.

45:04.121 --> 45:06.623
Because you see them
as trivial and unimportant,

45:06.707 --> 45:09.084
insisting that merit and merit alone

45:09.168 --> 45:11.920
is the only important metric
for advancement.

45:12.004 --> 45:16.341
Therefore, you are not,
and will never be seen as a team leader.

45:17.384 --> 45:18.886
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

45:19.386 --> 45:20.721
I'll manage somehow.

45:22.389 --> 45:24.308
Can I have the fucking report now?

45:37.279 --> 45:39.281
Hiding in plain sight the whole time.

45:40.115 --> 45:41.992
Always the classics with you.

45:42.492 --> 45:45.871
You hold the key to your own success
in your hand at this very moment.

45:46.580 --> 45:49.666
What am I supposed to do? Cross out your
name on the report and write my own?

45:49.750 --> 45:51.502
It's not about whose name
is on that report

45:51.585 --> 45:53.921
but what happens
to the information it reveals.

45:54.004 --> 45:55.172
Meaning what?

45:55.255 --> 45:58.759
The board believes the explosion was
caused by the second-stage LH2 valve.

45:58.842 --> 46:00.677
-Do you think it was something else?
-No.

46:00.761 --> 46:03.180
The valve is the culprit.
That much is obvious.

46:03.263 --> 46:06.308
The question is why did it fail?

46:06.725 --> 46:08.560
Defects in the manufacturing process.

46:08.644 --> 46:10.395
Yes, but again, why?

46:12.022 --> 46:15.567
Do you know why the thousands of
contractors and subcontractors

46:15.651 --> 46:16.902
who supply the Saturn V

46:16.985 --> 46:19.947
are spread across
the continental United States?

46:20.614 --> 46:21.865
Do you think it's an accident

46:21.949 --> 46:25.452
that so many are located
in key congressional districts?

46:25.911 --> 46:30.707
NASA gave the contract for the valve to
the wrong company for political reasons?

46:31.917 --> 46:37.130
When I was reviewing the supply chain
for the Saturn as part of my analysis,

46:37.214 --> 46:43.387
I was puzzled to find that the LH2 valve
was manufactured by Kirkland Aerospace,

46:43.971 --> 46:47.140
a company located in Rockford, Illinois.

46:47.641 --> 46:50.602
I was puzzled because
I remembered that contract.

46:51.019 --> 46:55.899
I had given it to a company
from Colorado Springs in the mid-'60s.

46:57.192 --> 47:03.198
Then, in early 1973,
NASA changed contractors.

47:04.241 --> 47:07.244
So... why the change?

47:08.412 --> 47:10.789
You don't need to read the report. Think.

47:11.123 --> 47:14.585
Why give a contract
to a company in Illinois?

47:14.960 --> 47:18.297
What was politically important about
that state to the administration

47:18.380 --> 47:21.592
that had just taken office in 1973?

47:24.219 --> 47:25.679
The Equal Rights Amendment.

47:28.307 --> 47:30.934
Everyone was surprised
that a Republican governor

47:31.018 --> 47:33.061
suddenly threw his weight behind the ERA.

47:33.145 --> 47:35.689
You're saying it was because
NASA moved a contract to Illinois?

47:36.190 --> 47:38.150
A huge contract.

47:38.650 --> 47:43.280
And in a district where he needed support
for his own re-election campaign.

47:44.281 --> 47:45.741
It's all in the report.

47:49.536 --> 47:50.787
My God.

47:51.705 --> 47:55.918
Gene died for a political vote?

47:56.001 --> 47:58.587
Not only Gene. Eleven other men.

47:59.171 --> 48:01.673
You knew him because
he worked in Mission Control,

48:01.924 --> 48:04.468
but I knew every man on that tower.

48:08.805 --> 48:11.642
This is gonna cause a firestorm in NASA.

48:13.018 --> 48:16.355
In Congress. The White House.

48:16.813 --> 48:18.482
If it is made public.

48:20.776 --> 48:24.613
Why wouldn't it be? The board's
whole report will be made public.

48:24.696 --> 48:28.200
Because it holds the potential
to do great harm to the president,

48:28.492 --> 48:33.413
Administrator Weisner will take my report,
classify it as top secret and bury it,

48:33.497 --> 48:35.207
never to be seen again.

48:35.958 --> 48:37.334
I don't believe that.

48:38.377 --> 48:43.215
Weisner may not be the best administrator
we've ever had, but he's not that cynical.

48:43.507 --> 48:45.926
Weisner is a political creature.

48:46.385 --> 48:48.387
His only loyalty is to Kennedy.

48:49.137 --> 48:52.599
And he will not allow Teddy's
great achievement of passing the ERA

48:52.683 --> 48:56.019
to be stained
by this sort of ugly politics.

48:57.354 --> 49:03.360
So... the only question that remains is
who will benefit from this situation.

49:05.779 --> 49:06.989
What are you saying?

49:07.364 --> 49:09.992
Every political system is flawed.

49:10.909 --> 49:13.787
And every bureaucracy is corrupt.

49:23.463 --> 49:24.882
Do you have to tell him?

49:25.215 --> 49:27.467
-He's gonna be really mad.
-Maybe you should've thought about that

49:27.551 --> 49:30.095
before you went around smashing
water meters with Danny Stevens.

49:30.179 --> 49:31.430
It was his idea.

49:31.513 --> 49:33.974
Don't you dare rat out your friend
just to save your butt, mister.

49:34.057 --> 49:35.559
That is not how we raised you.

49:36.977 --> 49:39.271
Please don't tell Dad. Please.

49:39.521 --> 49:41.607
Sit right here
and wait until I call you in.

49:42.566 --> 49:44.234
Don't move. Understand?

49:44.318 --> 49:45.319
Yes, ma'am.

49:49.031 --> 49:50.532
<i>So did you talk to the doctor?</i>

49:51.783 --> 49:52.951
Lieber? Yeah.

49:54.620 --> 49:55.787
<i>So what'd he say?</i>

49:56.955 --> 49:59.750
The same as all the other doctors.

49:59.833 --> 50:01.919
You know,
there's a chance that it could work,

50:02.002 --> 50:04.296
but of course,
he can't offer any guarantees.

50:04.379 --> 50:08.300
<i>No one can.
But he's got a great track record.</i>

50:10.594 --> 50:12.304
<i>So you gonna move forward?</i>

50:13.764 --> 50:16.016
<i>Why don't we just talk about it
when you get home?</i>

50:16.099 --> 50:18.018
<i>I have enough on my plate right now.</i>

50:18.101 --> 50:19.102
All right.

50:20.145 --> 50:23.440
<i>Besides I can't really get pregnant
without you.</i>

50:24.066 --> 50:25.275
You better not.

50:31.406 --> 50:32.616
<i>You okay?</i>

50:34.493 --> 50:35.869
What do you mean?

50:37.204 --> 50:40.040
I'm fine. It's just long days.

50:42.084 --> 50:43.877
Never-ending maintenance.

50:47.172 --> 50:52.511
So... where's Shane? Is he there?

50:57.599 --> 51:00.811
<i>No. Webelos meeting.</i>

51:01.728 --> 51:03.647
It's Pinewood Derby time.

51:04.189 --> 51:05.816
I love the Pinewood Derby.

51:07.109 --> 51:08.986
Wish I could be there for that.

51:09.736 --> 51:11.196
<i>Well, we do too.</i>

51:12.698 --> 51:16.451
<i>You know, Shane asked me the other day,</i>

51:16.535 --> 51:19.663
<i>"Why can't Dad just come home?"</i>

51:19.746 --> 51:23.208
You know, I explained to him that,
you know, after the rocket blew up,

51:23.292 --> 51:27.171
it meant that a relief crew can't come
and take your place.

51:28.338 --> 51:30.090
But you know Shane.

51:30.174 --> 51:33.844
He knows all the details of NASA
and he said,

51:33.927 --> 51:36.013
"Well, isn't the LEM right there
on the surface

51:36.096 --> 51:37.681
and the command module waiting in orbit?

51:37.764 --> 51:38.932
I mean, that's their lifeboat.

51:39.016 --> 51:42.561
Just tell Dad to take his lifeboat
and come home."

51:44.062 --> 51:45.355
<i>Smart kid.</i>

51:47.232 --> 51:48.317
Yeah.

51:50.903 --> 51:52.362
What should I tell him?

51:53.864 --> 51:57.618
<i>Tell him it's like being in the navy.</i>

51:57.701 --> 52:00.204
<i>Someone gives you an order,
you carry it out.</i>

52:01.413 --> 52:05.167
<i>My orders are to hold this post
until I'm properly relieved.</i>

52:05.250 --> 52:07.628
<i>So, that's what I'm gonna do.</i>

52:07.711 --> 52:09.129
<i>Hold until relieved.</i>

52:10.672 --> 52:11.757
I'll tell him.

52:13.967 --> 52:15.427
-<i>Hi, Bob.</i>
-<i>Hi, Bob.</i>

52:15.511 --> 52:16.762
<i>Hi, Bob.</i>

52:16.845 --> 52:18.472
<i>Sorry, just a minute. What's up?</i>

52:18.847 --> 52:19.890
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

52:19.973 --> 52:21.600
<i>I just finished the PLSS recharge,</i>

52:21.683 --> 52:24.061
<i>and I think I've got just enough time
to do some apartment hunting</i>

52:24.144 --> 52:26.188
<i>before it's time for "Hi, Bob."</i>

52:27.189 --> 52:28.315
-<i>Hi, Bob.</i>
-<i>Hi, Bob.</i>

52:28.815 --> 52:31.735
<i>Okay. Just watch your O2 this time.</i>

52:31.818 --> 52:33.070
<i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

52:35.906 --> 52:38.867
What's with all the "Hi, Bob" stuff?

52:38.951 --> 52:40.202
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

52:41.828 --> 52:45.749
<i>It's from </i>The Bob Newhart Show.

52:47.042 --> 52:49.294
<i>They haven't sent you anything else
to watch?</i>

52:49.711 --> 52:50.879
We've been asking,

52:50.963 --> 52:54.675
but so far it's just the same
six episodes of <i>Bob Newhart.</i>

52:55.092 --> 52:57.344
<i>It's kind of the highlight of the day,
to be honest.</i>

52:58.637 --> 53:01.306
<i>And every time someone says that phrase,</i>

53:01.390 --> 53:03.350
we all gotta say it.

53:03.433 --> 53:05.185
It's kinda dumb, I know, but--

53:08.772 --> 53:13.694
<i>And Gordo's apartment hunting?
Is that part of the show or...</i>

53:14.027 --> 53:19.074
No. He likes to take
these long walks outside.

53:20.617 --> 53:23.662
Calls it "apartment hunting"
for some reason.

53:25.163 --> 53:27.082
Just clears his mind.

53:27.165 --> 53:28.834
It's a healthy thing.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.796
Pretty close quarters up here.

53:32.880 --> 53:38.510
So sometimes you just need to get outside,
you know?

53:40.762 --> 53:45.684
<i>Hon, I don't wanna keep you
from Bob and Emily...</i>

53:46.018 --> 53:47.936
And Howard and Jerry and Carol.

53:51.064 --> 53:52.858
-<i>Love you.</i>
-I love you too.

54:20.969 --> 54:22.971
Your father's very disappointed in you.

54:23.764 --> 54:25.474
You're grounded for three weeks. Let's go.

54:37.069 --> 54:42.115
Well, Dr. von Braun certainly
writes a compelling report.

54:45.536 --> 54:46.912
What are you gonna do with it?

54:50.290 --> 54:53.085
I know that this assignment
wasn't easy for you, Margo.

54:53.418 --> 54:58.173
And I just want you to know that
the board of inquiry is very appreciative

54:58.257 --> 55:01.260
of the enormous
personal sacrifice it entailed.

55:02.386 --> 55:04.388
And I appreciate it as well.

55:04.471 --> 55:05.639
Mr. Weisner...

55:07.307 --> 55:09.685
will Dr. von Braun's findings be included

55:09.768 --> 55:13.146
in the final report
on the explosion of Apollo 23?

55:15.732 --> 55:19.820
I am classifying this report
as top secret as of this moment

55:19.903 --> 55:22.239
on my authority as NASA administrator.

55:22.531 --> 55:24.408
You're bound by oath
as a government employee

55:24.491 --> 55:26.869
not to reveal any of your knowledge
about this report,

55:27.286 --> 55:28.871
or even that it exists.

55:29.830 --> 55:34.334
Doing so could open you to being charged
with revealing classified information

55:34.793 --> 55:37.546
and spending 20 years
in a federal penitentiary.

55:38.422 --> 55:41.466
Do I make myself clear, Miss Madison?

55:45.262 --> 55:47.222
Every system is corrupt.

55:52.060 --> 55:53.270
I made a copy.

55:55.564 --> 55:57.482
I could have you arrested right now.

55:57.816 --> 56:00.360
And I have a friend who will mail it to
<i>The New York Times</i> tomorrow morning

56:00.444 --> 56:02.654
unless I personally tell them not to.

56:07.034 --> 56:08.327
What do you want?

56:10.996 --> 56:12.414
What I deserve.

56:14.541 --> 56:15.792
Flight director.

56:17.085 --> 56:20.088
There aren't any openings
on the Red, White or Blue teams.

56:21.673 --> 56:22.674
Make one.

56:45.322 --> 56:46.657
You need one of these.

56:48.534 --> 56:50.035
It's called a slide rule.

56:52.955 --> 56:57.918
Come see me in my office in... 20 minutes,
and I'll show you how to use it.

56:58.502 --> 56:59.670
Thank you.

56:59.753 --> 57:00.879
What's your name?

57:01.505 --> 57:02.506
Aleida.

57:03.173 --> 57:04.466
I'm Margo.

57:08.679 --> 57:10.848
-Do you play the piano?
-No.

57:12.808 --> 57:13.809
You're gonna learn.

58:03.192 --> 58:04.985
No one's ever been here before.

58:06.278 --> 58:08.405
No one's ever seen this before.

58:09.907 --> 58:11.200
Now I have.

58:14.870 --> 58:16.121
Jamestown Base.
