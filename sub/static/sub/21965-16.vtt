00:03.375 --> 00:06.333
"According to local legend,

00:03.375 --> 00:06.333
numerous Griffins once roamed

00:06.375 --> 00:09.166
the islands

00:06.375 --> 00:09.166
off the coast of Maine.

00:09.208 --> 00:11.583
A male Griffin made its home

00:09.208 --> 00:11.583
atop the rocky peak

00:11.625 --> 00:13.959
of the largest island,

00:11.625 --> 00:13.959
where it turned to stone

00:14.000 --> 00:17.083
for a long hibernation.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.083
This gave the island its name:

00:17.125 --> 00:19.417
Griffin Rock."

Aw, that's only a rock

he spotted us.

We need

00:42.750 --> 00:44.417
to protect ourselves.

Ha, ha.

00:44.458 --> 00:47.500
Now you're talkin'.

Just a little trick shot

CHIEF ( over radio ):

01:21.166 --> 01:24.208
Cody, get off the mountain,

01:21.166 --> 01:24.208
and watch out for rockslides.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.208
I don't see any rocks sliding.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.667
But I do see

01:27.667 --> 01:29.667
a car flying.

locate the Rubios.

On it, Dad.

Hop in, boys,

I'll take you home.

(  upbeat theme playing  )

Getting this Folklore patch

03:08.041 --> 03:11.166
is awesome!

03:17.083 --> 03:18.834
Dad, we've had

03:17.083 --> 03:18.834
a string of burglaries

03:18.875 --> 03:21.709
in the last 30 minutes.

03:18.875 --> 03:21.709
Couple bicycles,

03:21.750 --> 03:24.166
four satellite dishes,

03:21.750 --> 03:24.166
and a toy rocket.

03:24.208 --> 03:27.083
That's an odd

03:24.208 --> 03:27.083
assortment.

03:27.125 --> 03:30.834
Simultaneous thefts. I'll open

03:27.125 --> 03:30.834
a case file immediately.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.875
(  dramatic theme playing )

03:35.000 --> 03:36.917
Dani, did you find

03:35.000 --> 03:36.917
the Rubios?

03:36.959 --> 03:39.709
Up at Griffin Point Park.

03:36.959 --> 03:39.709
They were having a picnic

03:39.750 --> 03:42.417
when their car just

03:39.750 --> 03:42.417
took off into the air.

03:42.458 --> 03:45.083
Like something

03:42.458 --> 03:45.083
had snatched it, they said.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.125
Something invisible

03:45.125 --> 03:48.125
and terrifying.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.083
I added that last part.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.834
It did look like that car

03:50.125 --> 03:52.834
was being carried,

03:52.875 --> 03:54.625
and then just dropped.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.542
I'll add attempted car theft

03:54.667 --> 03:57.542
by an invisible something

03:57.583 --> 03:59.208
to the case file, as well.

03:59.250 --> 04:02.083

right after the earthquake.

GRAHAM:

04:02.125 --> 04:05.166
More specifically, it was

04:02.125 --> 04:05.166
a volcanic disturbance.

04:05.208 --> 04:10.125
Our seismic sensors put

04:05.208 --> 04:10.125
the origin on Wayward Island.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.542
But don't worry, there's

04:10.166 --> 04:12.542
no threat of an eruption.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.542
I would like to get to Wayward

04:12.583 --> 04:15.542
and replace this sensor, though.

Yeah, that island's nothing

04:25.792 --> 04:29.083
but an easy place to get lost.

It'll be exciting. I was just

04:29.125 --> 04:31.750
reading that female Griffins

04:31.792 --> 04:34.917
used one of the nearby islands

04:31.792 --> 04:34.917
as a nesting ground.

Maybe it's Wayward!

Sorry, Cody.

Aww...

04:50.583 --> 04:53.125
You do know those are

04:50.583 --> 04:53.125
only stories, right, son?

04:53.166 --> 04:55.083
Yeah, I know, but...

04:55.125 --> 04:58.458
Then why waste time looking for

04:55.125 --> 04:58.458
Griffins if they're not real?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.583
Because it would be

08:00.125 --> 08:02.792
And magnets interfere

08:00.125 --> 08:02.792
with compasses.

08:06.166 --> 08:08.500
There's something carved

08:06.166 --> 08:08.500
on here.

08:08.542 --> 08:11.625
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

08:11.667 --> 08:13.750
Are those Griffins?

08:13.792 --> 08:16.583
( gasps ):

08:13.792 --> 08:16.583
But Griffins aren't real.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.250
Or so I've been told.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.917
Looks like someone

08:22.041 --> 08:23.917
thought they were.

08:23.959 --> 08:26.000
Those are probably

08:23.959 --> 08:26.000
Viking runes.

08:26.041 --> 08:29.291
Norse explorers left carvings

08:26.041 --> 08:29.291
on a bunch of islands.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.792
Some Vikings did believe

08:30.834 --> 08:33.542
in mythical creatures

08:30.834 --> 08:33.542
like Griffins.

08:33.583 --> 08:36.875
What? It was in that

08:33.583 --> 08:36.875
history of war anthology.

08:36.917 --> 08:40.041
What if this marker was put here

08:36.917 --> 08:40.041
because Wayward Island

08:40.083 --> 08:42.542
is the nesting ground

08:40.083 --> 08:42.542
for Griffins?

08:42.583 --> 08:45.041
Those stories in your book

08:42.583 --> 08:45.041
had to come from somewhere.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.250
( rumbling )

08:47.291 --> 08:49.208
Uh, did you feel that?

08:49.250 --> 08:51.709
You mean the urge

08:49.250 --> 08:51.709
to go home?

08:51.750 --> 08:52.959
More like...

08:53.000 --> 08:55.333
Aah! An urge to fly!

08:55.375 --> 08:56.625
Whoa!

08:55.375 --> 08:56.625
Hey!

08:56.667 --> 08:58.250
( both scream )

08:58.291 --> 09:01.208

09:01.250 --> 09:02.458
Hey!

( both grunt )

10:13.166 --> 10:14.917
What is that?

10:14.959 --> 10:18.333
It's...It's the engine

10:14.959 --> 10:18.333
from the Darby Ava.

10:18.375 --> 10:19.792
Dad, do you read me?

10:19.834 --> 10:21.166
( static )

10:21.208 --> 10:22.959
Something's jamming

10:21.208 --> 10:22.959
the signal.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.667
Come on, let's go

10:23.000 --> 10:25.667
find the Bots!

10:25.709 --> 10:27.709
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

10:32.291 --> 10:33.750
You guys okay?

10:33.792 --> 10:36.125
Aw, felt like something

10:33.792 --> 10:36.125
grabbed me.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.792
And then just...

10:36.166 --> 10:38.792
let go.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.458
I know what you're thinking,

10:38.834 --> 10:41.458
and it was not a Griffin!

10:41.500 --> 10:44.166
No one's thinking that.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.917
BLADES: Griffin!

10:44.208 --> 10:46.917
Except maybe Blades.

10:48.875 --> 10:52.208
( panting ):

10:48.875 --> 10:52.208
A Griffin...it almost got me!

10:52.250 --> 10:53.917
You really saw one?

10:53.959 --> 10:55.792
Yes!

10:53.959 --> 10:55.792
Through there.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.542
Let's get back

10:55.834 --> 10:57.542
to the boat!

10:57.583 --> 10:58.917
Slow down,

10:57.583 --> 10:58.917
Blades.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.792
We're gonna have

10:58.959 --> 11:00.792
to check it out.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.291
Besides, can't drive

11:00.834 --> 11:03.291
a boat without a motor.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.834
And ours is sitting

11:03.333 --> 11:05.834
back there in the forest.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.375
Ohh.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.375
We're so doomed.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.917
(  upbeat theme playing  )

11:14.000 --> 11:18.291
CHASE:

11:14.000 --> 11:18.291
It was very kind of Doc Greene

11:14.000 --> 11:18.291
to lend us his Floating Lab.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.625
Certainly was, but I forgot

11:18.333 --> 11:21.625
how slow it moved.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.917
This is pointless anyway.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.917
There's no sign

11:23.959 --> 11:26.000
of the Rubios' car

11:23.959 --> 11:26.000
or the tow truck.

11:26.041 --> 11:28.166
But they were flying

11:26.041 --> 11:28.166
in this direction,

11:28.208 --> 11:30.083
straight for

11:28.208 --> 11:30.083
Wayward Island.

11:30.125 --> 11:34.125
Uh, has anyone heard

11:30.125 --> 11:34.125
from our Griffin Searchers?

11:34.166 --> 11:35.583
Graham, Cody,

11:34.166 --> 11:35.583
are you--?

11:35.625 --> 11:37.583
( static )

11:37.625 --> 11:39.291
We better

11:37.625 --> 11:39.291
get over there.

11:42.959 --> 11:44.291
It was through there.

11:44.333 --> 11:47.750
But I'm pretty sure

11:44.333 --> 11:47.750
it wants privacy.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.542
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:50.583 --> 11:51.834
Hang back.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.458
( squawking )

11:57.500 --> 11:59.250
( Transformers scream )

12:01.333 --> 12:03.458
Wait! It's just

12:01.333 --> 12:03.458
a statue.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.375
( sighs )

12:05.417 --> 12:08.792
Yeah. Ahem.

12:05.417 --> 12:08.792
Of course. What else?

12:08.834 --> 12:12.291
I'll tell you what else,

12:08.834 --> 12:12.291
an entrance.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.583
(  upbeat theme playing  )

12:17.458 --> 12:20.458
I think it's

12:17.458 --> 12:20.458
an ancient temple.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.750
I wonder if this place

12:20.500 --> 12:22.750
is in the book.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.875
I bet it was built by

12:26.000 --> 12:27.875
the same Viking explorers

12:27.917 --> 12:30.000
that carved the pillar

12:27.917 --> 12:30.000
we found earlier.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.834
Does it not bother anyone that

12:30.041 --> 12:33.834
this is a Temple for Griffins?

12:33.875 --> 12:35.834
Just because Vikings

12:33.875 --> 12:35.834
believed in them

12:35.875 --> 12:38.125
doesn't make 'em real.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.875
Doesn't mean that they're not.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.125
Here. It says,

12:42.166 --> 12:44.709
"Through the centuries,

12:42.166 --> 12:44.709
the nesting grounds

12:44.750 --> 12:46.333
have been considered

12:44.750 --> 12:46.333
a sacred place

12:46.375 --> 12:49.250
and are well protected."

12:49.291 --> 12:51.709
Protected by what, I wonder?

12:51.750 --> 12:54.542
I've got a bad feeling

12:51.750 --> 12:54.542
about this.

That was

an unexpected journey.

And most unpleasant.

come from?

on the Floating Lab

14:00.291 --> 14:02.709
with the Chief, Kade,

14:00.291 --> 14:02.709
and Dani, and the next--

14:02.750 --> 14:05.667
An Invisible Griffin

snatched you up, right?

Stepping on random tiles

triggers some sort of

rudimentary air cannons.

That is diabolical!

15:07.834 --> 15:12.250
Yet kinda genius.

This is why

15:12.291 --> 15:14.792
I don't like Griffins!

15:14.834 --> 15:16.542
Or Vikings.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.542
And I'm not crazy about

at the moment, either.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.125
a boat better than that.

I don't think this one

15:38.166 --> 15:40.333
was his fault.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.208
I see sunlight coming through

15:42.834 --> 15:45.208
on the far end.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.500
It might be a way out.

Blades, can you fly

15:48.458 --> 15:51.500
through here?

15:51.542 --> 15:54.875
No, too many low

15:51.542 --> 15:54.875
dangly things.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.583
If we drive, perhaps

15:54.917 --> 15:57.583
we can outpace the cannons

15:57.625 --> 15:59.500
and reach that exit

15:57.625 --> 15:59.500
along with Boulder.

are too slow.

out of stone

17:54.000 --> 17:55.542
and so are the eggs.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.291
( sighs ):

17:55.583 --> 17:57.291
He's right.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.667
It's just another

17:57.333 --> 17:59.667
Viking sculpture.

17:59.709 --> 18:01.917
Then how did all that

17:59.709 --> 18:01.917
metal stuff get up there?

18:01.959 --> 18:04.667
I, for one, am not giving up

18:01.959 --> 18:04.667
on the Mama theory.

18:04.709 --> 18:08.208
Guys, real or not,

18:04.709 --> 18:08.208
we found a Griffin's Nest.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.834
That's why we came,

18:08.250 --> 18:10.834
for the adventure.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.750
I was unaware there were

18:10.875 --> 18:13.750
electronics in the Viking age.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.834
( beeping )

18:18.250 --> 18:19.625
GRAHAM:

18:18.250 --> 18:19.625
Boulder, lift me up.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.208
CODY:

18:19.667 --> 18:21.208
Me, too.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.083
( beeping )

18:30.125 --> 18:32.500
It's the damaged quake sensor

18:30.125 --> 18:32.500
we've been looking for.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.542
( beeping continues )

18:37.458 --> 18:39.583
And that's the cliff

18:37.458 --> 18:39.583
where we installed it,

18:39.625 --> 18:41.250
way up on top.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.250
( whirring & beeping )

18:43.291 --> 18:45.750
The tremors must have sent

18:43.291 --> 18:45.750
the sensor tumbling

18:45.792 --> 18:47.250
all the way down

18:45.792 --> 18:47.250
to land here.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.875
( buzzing )

18:47.291 --> 18:49.875
Uh, so what's it doing now?

18:51.583 --> 18:53.208
Looks like a power surge.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.041
Uh-oh.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.417
( rumbling & grunting )

19:00.458 --> 19:03.375
( Transformers grunting )

19:03.417 --> 19:05.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:12.667 --> 19:15.166
Unh! What's causing this?

19:15.208 --> 19:17.041
Loadstone!

19:15.208 --> 19:17.041
All around us.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.834
The nest

19:17.083 --> 19:18.834
is a giant magnet.

19:18.875 --> 19:22.208
And when the sensor discharges

19:18.875 --> 19:22.208
energy into the loadstone...

19:22.250 --> 19:24.291
It creates a super-magnet.

19:24.333 --> 19:28.125
Strong enough to pull metal

19:24.333 --> 19:28.125
all the way from Griffin Rock?

19:28.166 --> 19:30.333
Okay, so there's

19:28.166 --> 19:30.333
no invisible Griffin.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.959
We're still stuck!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.750
I'll try shutting it down.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.792
( electricity crackling )

19:35.834 --> 19:37.834
Unh! No go.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.917
Once the sensor's

19:37.875 --> 19:39.917
power surge is over,

19:39.959 --> 19:42.041
the magnetic pull

19:39.959 --> 19:42.041
should cease as well.

19:42.083 --> 19:44.625
So we just have to wait

19:42.083 --> 19:44.625
for it to shut off again.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.792
( rumbling )

19:53.834 --> 19:55.792
( all grunt )

19:57.583 --> 20:01.000
So much for waiting.

19:57.583 --> 20:01.000
We're going down!

20:01.041 --> 20:04.625
They'll fall in the lava if

20:01.041 --> 20:04.625
we don't shut off that sensor!

20:04.667 --> 20:06.959
We need to throw something

20:04.667 --> 20:06.959
up there to break it.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.208
There's not a clean shot.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.583
Don't need one.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.625
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

20:18.333 --> 20:20.375
Come on, Cody,

20:18.333 --> 20:20.375
keep her steady.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.083
( crackling stops )

20:30.125 --> 20:31.417
HEATWAVE:

20:30.125 --> 20:31.417
Jump!

20:31.458 --> 20:34.542
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:38.625 --> 20:41.125
Nice shooting!

20:38.625 --> 20:41.125
Excellent aim, Cody.

20:41.166 --> 20:43.375
I want a slingshot.

20:43.417 --> 20:46.542
A ricochet, Code?

20:43.417 --> 20:46.542
Sweet.

20:46.583 --> 20:49.792
Yeah, well, this isn't

20:46.583 --> 20:49.792
my first Griffin Search.

20:49.834 --> 20:52.333
Lucky for us.

20:52.375 --> 20:56.542
Um, Cody...earlier,

20:52.375 --> 20:56.542
you know that brief moment

20:56.583 --> 20:59.083
when we thought this might be

20:56.583 --> 20:59.083
an actual Griffin's nest?

20:59.125 --> 21:03.083
Yeah?

20:59.125 --> 21:03.083
That was...kind of exciting.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.792
Thanks.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.750
(  soft dramatic theme playing  )

21:08.792 --> 21:10.667
CODY:

21:08.792 --> 21:10.667
Though the Griffin's Nest

21:08.792 --> 21:10.667
wasn't real,

21:10.709 --> 21:13.875
it was fun thinking

21:10.709 --> 21:13.875
it might be, even for a while.

21:13.917 --> 21:15.333
That's why old stories

21:13.917 --> 21:15.333
get passed

21:15.375 --> 21:17.709
from one generation

21:15.375 --> 21:17.709
to the next.

21:17.750 --> 21:20.000
People enjoy wondering,

21:17.750 --> 21:20.000
"What if?"

21:23.500 --> 21:25.458
I'm Cody Burns,

21:25.500 --> 21:27.583
and this concludes

21:25.500 --> 21:27.583
my Lad Pioneer report

21:27.625 --> 21:29.500
on Maine Island Folklore.

21:29.542 --> 21:32.959
What about my patch?
