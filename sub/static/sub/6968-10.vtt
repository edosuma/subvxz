00:47.756 --> 00:49.675
See you tomorrow, Beth.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.635
Okay.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.679
See you tomorrow.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.100
...get some
information about a crack house.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.310
This is some pretty
direct information.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.354
It came from an informant
who made a buy...

01:02.437 --> 01:06.608
and, uh, like it
when it's that direct--

01:06.692 --> 01:09.820
It's easy to get
a search warrant..

01:09.903 --> 01:12.197
I'm home.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.326
Hi.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.496
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.374
"Hey"?
All I get is "hey"?

01:22.457 --> 01:25.335
Hey, Mom.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.801
I'm gonna take
a quick shower.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.846
- You guys interested
in getting a pizza delivered?
- Mm.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.974
If that was a "yes,"
you can call the order in.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.018
And no pepperoni for me.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.471
Hello.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.141
Oh.
Yeah, sure.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.562
Ow.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.315
Tell Mom I'll be back
in five minutes, okay, butt crumb?

02:37.115 --> 02:39.284
He said he was only
going to be gone five minutes...

02:39.409 --> 02:41.453
and that was over
four hours ago.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.497
Yes.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.333
No, I don't know
who called him.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.335
The last person
to see him?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.337
His younger brother.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.772
...what's your ten-three? Over.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.774
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hmm?

03:22.327 --> 03:24.037
Gary?

03:24.121 --> 03:26.582
Gary Kane?

03:27.916 --> 03:30.210
Go get him a blanket.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.757
It's gonna be okay, son.
Hey, we're here to help you.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.303
Hey.
What's wrong?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.601
Oh, my God.

03:51.602 --> 03:54.002
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 10 - Red Museum

04:38.403 --> 04:42.324
Gary Kane. Sixteen years old.
High school junior.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.452
"C" student,
first-string varsity football,

04:45.536 --> 04:47.955
a member of the local
Four-H Club.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.957
Not one of Wisconsin's
more remarkable kids,

04:50.040 --> 04:52.209
but still the apple
of his mother's eye.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.129
- What does that mean?
- Nobody knows.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.131
What does
the police report say?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.592
The victim received
a phone call and left his home.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.387
He was discovered in the woods
in his underwear 12 hours later.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.722
He's been unable to give
a coherent statement.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.267
- Any evidence of sexual assault?
- No.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.602
Does it seem like it might
have been a schoolboy prank?

05:10.686 --> 05:12.938
The other victims have had
to be sedated and hospitalized...

05:13.021 --> 05:14.940
since their ordeals.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.609
They were reportedly
hysterical with fear.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.612
Victims? You mean there
have been others?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.615
One in eastern Wisconsin,
one three towns away.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.911
Both with the same words
written in black Magic Marker.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.997
What's your interest
in this?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.457
The local sheriff
in Delta Glen, Wisconsin,

05:32.499 --> 05:34.501
thinks he knows what's been
happening to these kids.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.295
What's that?

05:36.378 --> 05:39.506
He thinks
they've been possessed.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.467
There's something I think
you ought to see first.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.761
They call themselves
the Church of the Red Museum.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.638
They're followers of a guy
named Odin...

05:46.722 --> 05:48.640
that moved out here
from California three years ago...

05:48.724 --> 05:51.935
- and bought a ranch.
- What's the significance
of the name "Red Museum"?

05:52.019 --> 05:55.105
Well, Odin and the rest of them
are a bunch of vegetarians.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.149
They drove the ranch
right into the ground--

05:57.232 --> 05:59.484
Turned 500 head of beef
cattle into pets.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.987
Calls it
a "monument to barbarism."

06:02.070 --> 06:04.573
Probably went over big
with the local ranchers.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.783
Well, you got
to admit it takes some big ones...

06:06.867 --> 06:10.204
to set down in the middle of cow
country and start a church like his.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.030
They kind of stick out
like a sore thumb, don't they?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.074
You know, Sheriff,

06:47.115 --> 06:49.576
from what little we've seen
and what you've told us,

06:49.618 --> 06:51.578
they seem rather unlikely
to be involved...

06:51.620 --> 06:53.705
in the kind of activities
you described.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.749
Well, I won't
say another word.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.709
You can just see
for yourself.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.739
Om.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.908
That's Odin.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.678
"Today is a blessing
from our Lord and Master...

07:49.761 --> 07:53.724
who awaits his flock
in this time,

07:53.807 --> 07:56.018
the dawning
of the Age of Aquarius,

07:56.101 --> 07:59.396
eighteen Earth years
from the beginning...

07:59.479 --> 08:02.441
of the New Kingdom.

08:02.524 --> 08:06.528
The Guides speak through me today
as messengers of the Word,

08:06.612 --> 08:08.780
that we may be free
from death...

08:08.864 --> 08:12.576
and the passage
into spirit.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.786
As the acceleration continues,

08:14.870 --> 08:18.832
we, the enlightened,
must bring the teachings...

08:18.916 --> 08:21.502
of the skills for survival
to mankind.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.420
- They're walk-ins.
- Repeat in prayer--

08:23.504 --> 08:25.422
- What are "walk-ins"?
- We,

08:25.506 --> 08:28.675
- Uh.
- the second souls of the first bodies,

08:28.800 --> 08:31.762
"We, the second souls
of the first bodies,

08:31.845 --> 08:35.182
bearers of the Word and keepers
of the sacraments...

08:35.224 --> 08:37.183
of a new enlightenment.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.269
Believers in soul transference.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.397
Enlightened spirits who have taken
possession of other people's bodies.

08:42.481 --> 08:46.193
Blessed mission
and toil.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.445
Our struggle
is transcendent,

08:48.529 --> 08:50.572
and your guidance, our guides,

08:50.656 --> 08:53.951
Our struggle is transcendent...

08:54.034 --> 08:55.994
and your guidance,
our guides...

08:56.078 --> 08:58.830
will carry us toward
the dawning of a new age.

08:58.956 --> 09:03.377
will carry us toward
the dawning of a new age.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.840
Today
we bear witness...

09:07.881 --> 09:09.883
to three
who do not believe.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.136
We encourage them...

09:13.220 --> 09:15.472
to open their hearts
and minds...

09:15.556 --> 09:17.641
to our teachings--

09:17.724 --> 09:21.478
that they who slaughter
the flesh...

09:21.562 --> 09:24.648
slaughter their own souls...

09:24.731 --> 09:26.817
and must be taught the way."

09:32.239 --> 09:34.324
I only remember parts of it.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.410
Which parts are those?

09:38.412 --> 09:42.040
I was in the woods and...

09:42.082 --> 09:44.543
I felt...

09:44.585 --> 09:46.545
a spirit enter me.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.676
When you say "spirit,"
Gary,

09:52.759 --> 09:54.678
I'm not sure what you mean.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.349
It--

09:59.433 --> 10:01.351
It might have been
an animal spirit.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.439
I can't explain it.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.443
Something...

10:09.484 --> 10:11.737
just came over me.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.072
And you don't remember
who called you?

10:15.449 --> 10:17.409
Anything at all
about what happened...

10:17.451 --> 10:19.411
immediately after you left home
that night?

10:21.788 --> 10:26.251
Have you everhad any dealings
with anyone from the Church
of the Red Museum?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.253
I see them around.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.589
Do you have any reason to believe
that they may have been involved...

10:30.631 --> 10:32.591
in what happened to you?

10:32.633 --> 10:35.093
Now, tell him
what you told me, Gary.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.306
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.266
- Who are you?
- Stevie.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.810
Oh, you're
in all the pictures.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.812
You must be Gary's
younger brother.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.607
I'm Dana.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.485
Stevie, do you remember
who your brother...

10:51.568 --> 10:53.529
might have gone out
to see the other night?

10:56.073 --> 10:58.116
Did he say anything?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.290
Scully, we'll meet you outside.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.965
- Has this boy ever been in any trouble?
- Gary?

11:13.048 --> 11:15.467
- Yeah.
- No. I've known him since he was a kid.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.636
He's the same age
as my son.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.681
He's done some beer drinking,
but he's just your basic 16 year old.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.683
At least, he was.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.270
- Do you see a notable difference in him?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.981
Gary Kane
lived for football.

11:29.064 --> 11:32.150
He's a damn good athlete too.
Now he won't even suit up.

11:32.234 --> 11:35.988
The Red Museum, how are they
treated by the local citizens?

11:36.071 --> 11:38.073
Nobody much cares for them.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.909
But are they ever singled out?
Shop owners refusing to sell to them?

11:40.993 --> 11:44.162
- Stuff like that?
- Well, there's a reasonable
amount of tension,

11:44.246 --> 11:46.707
but most folks are happy
to just try to avoid them.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.376
Uh, can you recommend
a good motel in the area?

11:49.459 --> 11:53.672
Sure. You're going to stay? You think
there might be something to this?

11:53.755 --> 11:56.842
I want to run a background check
on the Church and this guy, Odin.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.887
If you could just show us a good
motel and a good place to eat.

11:59.970 --> 12:03.056
You've come to the right
place for that.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.272
You know, Mulder,

12:10.355 --> 12:13.025
with ribs like these, I'd say
that the Church of the Red Museum...

12:13.108 --> 12:15.277
has it's work
cut out for it.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.281
Thanks.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.285
So.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.412
You started to tell me
about walk-ins,

12:25.537 --> 12:28.290
but I'm not sure if I grasp
the finer points.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.418
Uh, it's kind of a New Age religion
based on an old idea--

12:31.543 --> 12:33.462
that if you, uh,
lose hope or despair...

12:33.545 --> 12:35.464
and want to leave
this mortal coil,

12:35.547 --> 12:37.591
you become open
and vulnerable.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.551
To inhabitation
by a new spirit.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.595
A new, enlightened spirit.

12:41.637 --> 12:45.057
According to the literature, Abe Lincoln
was a walk-in, and Mikhail Gorbachev,

12:45.140 --> 12:47.392
and Charles Colson,
Nixon's advisor.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.394
- But not Nixon?
- No.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.396
Not even they
want to claim Nixon.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.398
Oh.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.443
So are you still subscribing to
the sheriffs claims of a possession?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.445
I don't know.

12:58.529 --> 13:01.782
In the absence of any other
plausible explanation,

13:01.865 --> 13:03.951
it's a novel theory.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.495
Well, I'll tell you
something.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.623
I got the creeps in that
apartment today.

13:09.665 --> 13:12.292
- Really?
- Towelhead.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.294
Yeah. Why? What's going on?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.296
Turn around, man.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.299
Hey, veggie burger,
who let you out?

13:19.341 --> 13:22.803
The spur posse
just rode into town.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.722
Hey, diaper head.
We're talking to you, man.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.350
- How's your pet cow?
- Did you get any milk out of him?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.477
We're talking to you,
Aladdin.

13:30.561 --> 13:33.397
What's the matter
diaper head, huh?

13:33.522 --> 13:35.190
- Huh?
- Nothing.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.985
Hey, leave him alone.
Leave him alone.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.487
Go home.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.990
Go ahead.
Go home.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.034
Catch you later,
Red.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.246
- You got a problem?
- Yeah. Who asked you?

13:49.329 --> 13:52.040
- I see four against one,
I got a problem.
- Mulder.

13:53.584 --> 13:57.004
Yeah, well. Why don't you
run along with the little wife?

13:57.045 --> 14:00.174
- You're gonna miss the tour bus.
- She's got a gun.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.552
Well, what's she gonna do?
Shoot us?

14:03.635 --> 14:07.181
Go call my dad, Katie.
I think he'd like to hear about this.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.558
- Who's your dad?
- He's the sheriff.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.188
Yeah, I think he would
like to hear about this.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.399
Come on. Let's just
get out of here, Rick.

14:25.407 --> 14:29.328
Kind of hard to tell the villains
without a score card.

14:35.918 --> 14:40.172
~ And everything she said ~

14:40.255 --> 14:45.177
~ Count every time
she pushed me ~

14:45.260 --> 14:50.849
~ And left me with the dead ~

15:23.048 --> 15:25.092
Pupper Dog?

15:25.217 --> 15:27.928
Is that you?

15:27.970 --> 15:30.931
Pupper Dog.

15:31.014 --> 15:34.309
What are you doing here?
Huh, girl?

16:12.973 --> 16:15.100
Get off me!
Get off me!

16:19.438 --> 16:22.900
Help me!
Please, somebody help me!

16:22.941 --> 16:25.402
Help me!
Please!

16:27.446 --> 16:29.865
Yeah, Danny,
this is all good stuff. Yeah.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.034
See what else you can find
on him from the N.C.I.C...

16:32.117 --> 16:34.411
and call me back at this number
or on my cellular.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.581
I just examined the girl.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.583
What did you find?

16:39.625 --> 16:42.753
Not much until the toxicology
report came back.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.089
They found trace amounts
of an unspecified alkaloid
substance in her blood--

16:46.215 --> 16:48.133
possibly an opiate
derivative--

16:48.217 --> 16:51.845
as well as a dangerously large quantity
of something called scopolamine.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.139
Is that the stuff they use
for motion sickness?

16:54.223 --> 16:56.642
Only in very small dosages.
Anything past .2 micrograms...

16:56.725 --> 17:00.562
and you've got
a very powerful anaesthetic
with hallucinogenic qualities.

17:00.604 --> 17:02.606
It's been in the news lately
because Columbian gangs...

17:02.648 --> 17:05.400
have been using it in kidnappings
to subdue their victims.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.528
- Is it a controlled substance?
- Yes.

17:07.611 --> 17:11.573
You probably have to be
a doctor or a pharmacist to get
ahold of these quantities.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.078
"Richard Odin,
also known as Doug Herman,

17:16.118 --> 17:20.415
left A.M.A. in 1986
over questionable-ethics inquiry.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.459
Did not renew license."

17:22.501 --> 17:24.461
I'll drive.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.769
I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder. We're with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.771
We'd like to speak
to Richard Odin.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.773
- Is he in?
- Just a moment.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.736
- Mr. Odin.
- Yes.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.530
We'd like to ask you some questions.
May we come inside?

17:51.655 --> 17:55.033
I'm sorry.
I can't allow you in this house.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.786
We can get a warrant,
if that's what it takes.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.831
You can... get a warrant, if you'd like,
but you will not enter this building.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.416
Well,
how's that?

18:02.499 --> 18:04.418
Because you're meat eaters.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.504
And the buildings, our houses
and our kitchens cannot be
desecrated by your presence.

18:07.588 --> 18:10.382
I believe I am well within
my religious rights to prevent it.

18:10.465 --> 18:13.427
Yes. But you can't hide behind your
rights if a crime has been committed.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.721
Have I been accused
of a crime?

18:24.855 --> 18:27.900
We can always determine that elsewhere.
Can you step outside, please, sir?

18:29.526 --> 18:32.821
Can you step outside, Mr. Odin?
We're placing you under arrest.

18:40.204 --> 18:43.165
Are you familiar with a substance
called scopolamine, Mr. Odin?

18:43.248 --> 18:45.250
Are you familiar with
bovine growth hormones...

18:45.334 --> 18:47.336
and the inhumane treatment
of beef and dairy cattle--

18:47.419 --> 18:49.254
just answer the question,
Mr. Odin.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.300
Yes, I know it.

18:53.383 --> 18:57.429
But I've never prescribed it
or administered it.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.515
Have you ever ordered
others to do so?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.225
No.

19:01.350 --> 19:03.560
Do your religious beliefs
preclude you from exacting revenge,

19:03.644 --> 19:07.022
either physically or psychically,
on those who might not share them?

19:09.149 --> 19:11.985
The barbarians will one day
be cleansed from the Earth.

19:12.069 --> 19:15.280
Answer the question. You did it, didn't
you? You did something to those kids.

19:15.364 --> 19:18.867
Sheriff, I've already had to go
through this once with your kid.

19:18.951 --> 19:22.120
If you'll just
take a walk--

19:22.204 --> 19:24.206
Hey, Sheriff.
Could you come here for a minute?

19:24.289 --> 19:28.669
You know, for a holy man, you've got
quite a knack for pissing people off.

19:30.838 --> 19:32.923
We've got problems
down the street.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.721
Keep your minds open
to the wisdom of the Guides.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.766
- We don't care
about the wisdom of the Guides.
- All we ask is that you listen.

19:45.978 --> 19:48.063
All right, man.
Let's do it.

19:49.690 --> 19:54.027
End the slaughter. The rights
of the just must be protected.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.946
Just as the barbarism
must cease.

19:56.029 --> 20:00.367
Violence against nature
begets violence against man.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.953
How about a little cow blood?

20:05.998 --> 20:08.125
What do you
think you're doing?

20:08.250 --> 20:10.335
Get out of here.
Get! Get!

20:13.297 --> 20:16.466
- They got what they deserved.
- They asked for it.

20:25.934 --> 20:29.146
- You the F.B.I. agents?
- Yes.

20:31.148 --> 20:33.400
I have something
I'd like to show you.

21:16.944 --> 21:18.904
This pasture land...

21:18.946 --> 21:20.864
belonged to my granddad.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.576
He bought it in 1890.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.662
He died right over there,

21:26.745 --> 21:28.664
next to that cattle pen.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.666
Eighty two years old.

21:30.749 --> 21:35.128
just fell off the tractor
one morning.

21:35.254 --> 21:39.216
My dad worked this piece
for the next 40 years.

21:39.299 --> 21:43.887
And I put in 25 myself
before I decided to call it quits.

21:43.971 --> 21:49.309
Sold it for 80 times
what my granddad paid.

21:49.393 --> 21:53.272
- Why did you sell it?
- Business changed.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.274
People changed too.

21:55.315 --> 21:59.361
- In what way?
- Competition.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.656
Used to get by
with 50 milk cows.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.658
Now you gotta have 500.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.660
Used to turn them out
to pasture.

22:06.743 --> 22:09.204
Now you keep them in pens
and grain-feed them.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.708
You said you wanted
to show us something.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.501
You're looking at it.

22:14.585 --> 22:17.588
See those men
over there?

22:17.671 --> 22:21.884
Well, they're injecting the cattle
with something called B.S.T.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.094
Bovine Somatotropin.

22:24.136 --> 22:26.680
A genetically engineered
growth hormone.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.766
Yeah. Shoot them up
and a cow will produce...

22:29.808 --> 22:31.727
ten percent more milk.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.188
Feed it to beef cattle,
and more meat on the hoof.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.148
Changed the business.

22:37.274 --> 22:39.318
Changed a whole lot
of things.

22:40.319 --> 22:42.529
How do you mean?

22:42.654 --> 22:46.909
Well, that, uh, fracas
in town this afternoon--

22:46.992 --> 22:50.704
ten, even five years ago
never would have happened.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.915
People around here
have changed.

22:52.998 --> 22:56.585
You know, gotten mean,
spiteful.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.879
Dog eat dog.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.382
We had seven rapes
here last year--

23:02.466 --> 23:05.719
by high school boys.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.805
Well, that, uh--

23:08.889 --> 23:12.351
This business of the kids
being found in the woods.

23:12.392 --> 23:17.814
Well, I think that you're going to find
it all comes from the same root source.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.650
The growth hormone?

23:19.733 --> 23:22.027
Yes, sir.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.112
But those hormones
have been proven safe.

23:24.196 --> 23:25.989
They've been cleared
by the F.D.A.

23:26.073 --> 23:28.075
Says who?

23:28.158 --> 23:30.160
The government?

23:30.202 --> 23:32.204
God.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.288
I don't know, Doc.

24:14.371 --> 24:17.875
I'm losing oil pressure like crazy.
I don't know what's going on.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.877
How far are we
from the airport?

24:19.918 --> 24:22.880
We're not going to make it. I'm gonna
have to find some place to put it down.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.386
Look out!

24:58.582 --> 25:00.626
We're still trying
to I.D. the pilot.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.295
What about
the second body?

25:03.337 --> 25:05.297
That's
Dr. Jerald Larson.

25:05.339 --> 25:07.633
- Did you know him?
- Yeah.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.636
He delivered my kid.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.305
There's something else
over here I want you to see.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.645
Thank you.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.859
Looks like the doctor may have been
delivering more than babies.

25:25.984 --> 25:28.654
That's why I brought you out here.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.335
Any clue
what this is about?

25:43.377 --> 25:45.337
I have no idea.

25:45.379 --> 25:47.339
jerry Larson was a pillar
in this community.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.299
He was the last
of the country doctors.

25:49.383 --> 25:52.678
Well, wherever he was coming from, I'd
say that was one hell of a house call.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.597
You don't think this has anything to do
with what happened to those kids?

25:55.681 --> 25:57.933
I think we'll know more
once we find out what this is.

26:02.104 --> 26:04.106
You're sure?

26:04.189 --> 26:06.108
Both kids?

26:06.191 --> 26:09.111
No, that's okay. I'm sure you're
correct. Thank you very much.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.030
Scully. You're not gonna believe this.

26:12.072 --> 26:15.659
You found a connection
between the out-of-town kids
and the kids abducted here--

26:15.742 --> 26:19.329
Every one of them was delivered and
treated through childhood by Dr. Larson.

26:19.413 --> 26:22.291
Yeah, the printouts we found in the
briefcase were mostly shipping orders...

26:22.374 --> 26:24.293
along with a list
of credit card numbers,

26:24.376 --> 26:26.587
each number corresponding to a card
in the victim's family.

26:26.712 --> 26:29.214
Why would he carry a list
of credit card numbers?

26:29.298 --> 26:31.300
I don't know.
Maybe to track them...

26:31.425 --> 26:33.343
the way credit card companies
track stolen cards.

26:33.427 --> 26:36.513
But why? And what was he
treating them for?

26:37.598 --> 26:39.558
What was he
treating them with ?

26:39.641 --> 26:42.311
I don't know.

26:42.394 --> 26:46.773
We won't get the test results back
on the vial until tomorrow.

26:46.815 --> 26:49.193
Are you thinking it might be
bovine growth hormone?

26:49.276 --> 26:52.362
I know that was the first thing
through both of our minds,
but it just doesn't track.

26:52.446 --> 26:54.448
Not with that briefcase
full of cash.

26:54.531 --> 26:58.202
I know and it still doesn't answer the
question about who's marking those kids.

26:58.285 --> 27:00.746
Or why.

27:11.882 --> 27:13.800
Away.

27:20.307 --> 27:22.809
So, I'll see you
in the morning.

27:22.893 --> 27:24.811
Yeah, 8:30 sharp.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.603
Howdy.

28:15.195 --> 28:17.489
Hi.

28:17.531 --> 28:19.533
Sorry to come
unannounced.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.537
Gary's not home right now.

28:23.620 --> 28:27.040
Actually, we wanted to talk
with you, if that's okay.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.335
I don't know what to say.

28:30.377 --> 28:32.880
You think Dr. Larson was doing
some kind of tests on Gary?

28:33.005 --> 28:36.383
Well, thinking back, is there
anything that seems strange to you?

28:36.425 --> 28:38.385
Was Gary sick often?

28:38.427 --> 28:41.847
No. Actually, Gary's never
been sick a day in his life.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.891
Gary was never sick?

28:43.932 --> 28:45.684
No.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.728
Why was he going
to Dr. Larson?

28:47.769 --> 28:50.230
Dr. Larson gave him
vitamin shots.

28:50.272 --> 28:52.232
He gave them
to a lot of kids.

28:52.274 --> 28:54.401
He said it was like treating
their teeth with fuoride...

28:54.484 --> 28:56.403
as a preventative measure.

28:56.486 --> 28:58.447
Did you ever take Gary
to another doctor?

28:58.530 --> 29:02.117
No. Jay had wanted to.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.661
Jay is your husband?

29:04.745 --> 29:06.663
Yes.

29:06.747 --> 29:08.707
He was concerned
Gary wasn't growing.

29:08.749 --> 29:12.836
Jay was 6'5". He wanted Gary
to play collegeball.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.215
- But then there was Jay's accident.
- What accident?

29:16.340 --> 29:20.260
It was seven years ago.
He worked at the packing plant.

29:20.302 --> 29:23.889
He had an accident
with one of the machines.

29:27.935 --> 29:30.479
Excuse me.
What is this?

29:37.444 --> 29:39.404
What?

29:39.446 --> 29:41.406
This light here.

29:41.490 --> 29:43.575
I don't know.

29:50.332 --> 29:52.292
There's something
back there.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.804
What is it, Mulder?

30:03.846 --> 30:07.808
Looks like somebody's
private little movie studio.

30:07.850 --> 30:09.810
What?

30:14.523 --> 30:16.650
Oh, my God.

30:42.551 --> 30:44.511
Gotta drain the lizard.

30:46.555 --> 30:48.515
What do you want,
applause, man?

31:27.679 --> 31:29.723
Rick?

31:30.849 --> 31:32.893
Rick?

31:51.078 --> 31:54.248
Sheriff, we're gonna find
who did this.

31:54.331 --> 31:56.291
Get away from him.

31:58.210 --> 32:00.128
Get back.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.590
Oh, my God.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.594
Ricky.
Rick, son.

32:12.516 --> 32:14.476
No.

32:14.518 --> 32:17.187
No. No!

32:40.252 --> 32:42.796
His name is Gerd Thomas.

32:42.921 --> 32:45.174
He's owned the building
for 21 years.

32:47.426 --> 32:49.553
He used to run
a day care center out of it.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.806
They're
holding him for us.

32:59.688 --> 33:03.275
What is it?

33:04.526 --> 33:08.197
- I know that face.
- What?

33:22.211 --> 33:25.506
That's quite a video library
you've compiled for yourself.

33:25.589 --> 33:27.674
I especially like the ones
with the little boys.

33:29.593 --> 33:31.553
I know.

33:33.597 --> 33:36.350
- I'm a sick man.
- No.

33:36.391 --> 33:39.853
No. Men who know they're sick
try to get help.

33:39.895 --> 33:41.897
You just kept right at it
for years.

33:41.939 --> 33:46.401
I didn't mean to hurt
anyone.

33:46.485 --> 33:48.987
Did you kidnap those kids?

33:50.113 --> 33:52.491
Yes.

33:53.784 --> 33:56.453
Are you prepared
to confess to those crimes?

33:56.537 --> 33:59.081
Yes.

33:59.164 --> 34:01.792
- And to the murder
of Rick Mazeroski and--
- No.

34:04.419 --> 34:06.547
I never murdered anybody.

34:15.556 --> 34:18.516
Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski?

34:20.101 --> 34:23.397
Did you write this on his back?

34:23.438 --> 34:26.024
- Oh, my God.
- Answer the question.

34:27.650 --> 34:30.612
No, I--
I never killed him.

34:32.322 --> 34:34.491
I never killed anybody. I--

34:34.574 --> 34:37.494
I really loved those kids.

34:37.578 --> 34:39.663
Is this how you express
your love for them?

34:41.123 --> 34:43.083
Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski?

34:43.166 --> 34:45.377
- Did you write that on his back?
- Yes.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.880
- Why?
- Because of what he had become.

34:47.963 --> 34:49.882
What had he become?

34:49.965 --> 34:53.217
Because those kids have
become monsters. That's what.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.429
You're not making any sense.
Now, make sense to me.

34:58.849 --> 35:01.768
Because of Dr. Larson
and because of the tests.

35:11.653 --> 35:13.697
Excuse me.

35:23.957 --> 35:25.876
Okay, what tests?

35:29.046 --> 35:32.007
Dr. Larson was using
those kids as guinea pigs.

35:32.049 --> 35:35.385
- And he was using us too.
- What do you mean, using you?

35:35.469 --> 35:37.596
To inoculate the cattle.

35:37.679 --> 35:39.556
With growth hormones?

35:39.640 --> 35:41.558
I don't know exactly
what it was,

35:41.642 --> 35:43.894
but he was paying us
a lot of money to do it.

35:43.977 --> 35:46.396
So, you're saying that Dr. Larson
was paying you a lot of money...

35:46.480 --> 35:49.316
to inject the cattle with something,
and you didn't know what it was.

35:49.399 --> 35:53.862
Not until later.
Not until after all those rapes and--

35:56.281 --> 35:58.742
Dr. Larson told my boss
that he felt responsible...

35:58.825 --> 36:01.703
for everything that
those kids had done...

36:03.580 --> 36:06.875
and that he was giving them
the same inoculations.

36:08.085 --> 36:10.087
Was Dr. Larson involved
in the kidnappings?

36:10.170 --> 36:12.881
No. No. No.

36:12.923 --> 36:16.218
He didn't want
his secret to come out.

36:18.428 --> 36:21.598
He didn't care
about those kids, like me.

36:24.935 --> 36:26.854
- Mulder.
- Uh-huh.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.861
You know, I think he's
telling the truth.

36:33.944 --> 36:35.904
I don't think
he killed anyone.

36:35.946 --> 36:40.576
- How can you be sure?
- I just got the toxicology report
back on the broken vial.

36:40.617 --> 36:42.578
The residual substance couldn't
be analyzed...

36:42.619 --> 36:44.621
because it contained
synthetic corticosteroids...

36:44.663 --> 36:46.748
with unidentified
amino acids.

36:46.832 --> 36:49.543
That's purity control,
Mulder.

36:52.337 --> 36:54.798
Do you know what you're
saying, Scully?

36:54.840 --> 36:57.301
The man who died in that plane crash
was inoculating those kids...

36:57.342 --> 37:01.096
with antibodies derived from what may
have been an extraterrestrial source.

37:01.138 --> 37:04.057
He's been injecting those kids
with alien DNA.

37:04.141 --> 37:06.143
No, Mulder.
That was never proven conclusively.

37:06.268 --> 37:08.729
But it's the same substance we found
in the Erlenmeyer flask, isn't it?

37:08.812 --> 37:11.273
The same material
my Deep Throat contact died for.

37:11.315 --> 37:14.193
- Yes.
- Well, it all makes sense.
The money in the briefcase.

37:14.276 --> 37:16.403
They've been conducting an experiment
here. Somebody's been paying...

37:16.486 --> 37:19.907
to have those kids injected with
alien DNA to see how they'd react.

37:19.990 --> 37:22.451
- It's been going on for years.
- Does that man know anything about it?

37:22.534 --> 37:25.913
No. He's just some poor soul
who blew their cover.

37:25.996 --> 37:28.040
I don't think he knows
any more than he's telling us.

37:28.123 --> 37:31.543
I think his boss must have
because they just found him
shot to death in a cow pasture.

37:31.627 --> 37:33.921
What?

37:34.004 --> 37:36.215
I think I know
who shot him, Mulder.

37:36.298 --> 37:39.760
That man that I recognized
on the road today,

37:39.843 --> 37:42.471
that's the same man that
executed Deep Throat.

37:45.015 --> 37:48.769
Well, whoever's behind this,
he's here covering their tracks.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.812
He's gonna go after the kids.
You get the sheriff...

37:50.854 --> 37:54.107
and meet me
at Gary Kane's apartment.

37:54.191 --> 37:56.318
And Scully,

37:56.360 --> 37:59.238
I want this guy alive.

38:15.629 --> 38:18.090
- Where's Gary?
- He's in his bedroom.

38:18.215 --> 38:20.509
Go pack some clothes, things you'll
need. You're all coming with me.

38:20.592 --> 38:23.762
- What?
- I'll explain later.

38:34.982 --> 38:37.568
Those credit card numbers--
every kid's family that was listed,

38:37.651 --> 38:39.570
get them packed up.

38:39.611 --> 38:41.572
Call out every man you've got.

38:41.613 --> 38:43.657
Where are we
taking them?

38:43.740 --> 38:45.993
- Yes.
- I need your help.

38:46.076 --> 38:48.161
For?

38:48.245 --> 38:50.205
It may offend your
religious sensibilities,

38:50.247 --> 38:51.874
but it could help save
some kids' lives.

39:30.996 --> 39:33.207
Sheriff.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.293
Where's Mulder?

39:36.376 --> 39:39.838
He told me to make sure
that the kids were safe.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.633
He thought there was some other
place this guy might be.

41:20.689 --> 41:22.733
Stop right there!

41:57.935 --> 41:59.645
Hey!

42:06.193 --> 42:08.153
Don't move!

42:09.530 --> 42:11.782
Put it down. Now.

42:14.326 --> 42:16.495
Just put the lighter down.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.127
Hey.

42:43.063 --> 42:45.649
Get him out of here.
Get everyone out of here.

42:45.691 --> 42:47.693
Come on.

42:53.782 --> 42:58.245
File number X.W.C. 060361.

42:58.328 --> 43:02.499
The identity of the man shot in the
slaughterhouse has yet to be determined.

43:02.583 --> 43:06.670
His name, any record or artifact of his
past, present or immigration status...

43:06.712 --> 43:08.672
have yet to be found.

43:08.714 --> 43:13.677
His finger prints are not
on file in either the F.B.I.
or national system of records.

43:13.719 --> 43:15.679
At this time,
it remains doubtful...

43:15.721 --> 43:19.683
that anyone will come forward
to I.D. or claim the body.

43:19.725 --> 43:23.020
Under further analysis, the inoculant
found in the broken vials...

43:23.061 --> 43:26.190
was isolated and determined
to be an unstable antibody...

43:26.273 --> 43:28.734
of no known biological origin.

43:28.775 --> 43:32.738
After three weeks of study,
the components of the serum--
probably synthetic--

43:32.821 --> 43:37.576
have broken down structurally
and, in this retrograde state,
can not be analyzed further.

43:37.659 --> 43:39.578
This coincides
with the development...

43:39.620 --> 43:42.372
of a severe and undiagnosed
flu-like ailment...

43:42.456 --> 43:45.042
affecting the children who were
believed to have been inoculated...

43:45.125 --> 43:47.377
and some of the local families.

43:47.461 --> 43:51.048
To date, none of the congregants
or members of the Church
of the Red Museum...

43:51.173 --> 43:53.425
have contracted this illness.

43:53.509 --> 43:57.763
I suspect whoever was doing this may
have been using them as a control group.

43:57.846 --> 44:00.390
The shipping manifests
for what is believed to be...

44:00.474 --> 44:03.727
milk and beef tainted
by the unspecified inoculant...

44:03.810 --> 44:07.773
did not provide enough information
to track their destinations.

44:07.898 --> 44:11.360
A local advisory and quarantine
have been established.

44:11.485 --> 44:14.071
Further inquiry into
the tainted beef has been promised...

44:14.154 --> 44:16.114
by the pertinent government
health agencies.

44:16.198 --> 44:21.954
The F.B.I. investigation into this
case is currently at a standstill.

44:21.955 --> 44:24.954
The case remain open and unsolved.
