01:03.289 --> 01:07.753
No, no, you keep your goddamn head
down, all right? You hear me?

01:15.485 --> 01:19.741
Take out that gunner! Stay here,
you don't move a goddamn muscle!

02:35.030 --> 02:36.551
Bill.

02:40.136 --> 02:42.052
Bill, please, please, don't leave.

02:42.152 --> 02:44.626
Please don't leave, I don't wanna die.

02:48.482 --> 02:50.358
Goddammit, kid.

02:53.116 --> 02:55.770
No, Bill, please. Bill, please.

02:56.919 --> 02:58.439
Please.

02:59.241 --> 03:02.244
Bill. Bill, Bill, don't leave!

03:44.400 --> 03:46.220
Wake up, Bill.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.045
Come on, wake up!

03:51.907 --> 03:53.577
Please, don't shoot him, Luther.

03:53.677 --> 03:57.681
Nobody's gonna shoot nobody.
We're just here to take Bill to jail.

03:57.781 --> 03:59.299
Jail?

04:00.148 --> 04:02.019
Now, hold on a minute, I ain't done nothin'.

04:02.119 --> 04:04.721
You sell the horse
and the carriage to Sam here?

04:04.821 --> 04:07.457
Ain't nothin' wrong
with a little commerce, is there?

04:07.557 --> 04:10.227
But did you own that horse and carriage?

04:10.327 --> 04:13.145
I would if I had any kinda luck.

04:14.663 --> 04:16.700
Get up and get dressed.

04:17.230 --> 04:19.320
And don't try nothin'...

04:20.136 --> 04:21.838
...'cause I got your gun.

04:21.938 --> 04:23.791
Can I leave?

04:25.574 --> 04:27.077
Let her go.

04:27.177 --> 04:30.664
She's a fine woman, highly talented.

04:31.180 --> 04:35.333
- You may quote me, my dear.
- Thank you. I'll come visit ya, Bill.

04:36.357 --> 04:37.871
Go!

04:51.601 --> 04:53.120
Shit!

04:55.104 --> 04:57.558
I need hardly remind you that I never miss.

04:57.658 --> 04:59.876
Your gun, please, and mine.

05:07.749 --> 05:09.820
You think you're gonna
get away with this, Bill?

05:10.220 --> 05:12.240
Sam, open the closet.

05:13.222 --> 05:14.644
Get inside.

05:14.744 --> 05:18.907
- But I'm not really good in confined spaces.
- Sam! Closet or the bullet, come on.

05:22.499 --> 05:27.138
- You, too, Sheriff. Sorry.
- I am not gonna forget this.

05:28.038 --> 05:29.857
I'm sure you won't.

05:36.011 --> 05:37.298
Get inside.

05:39.198 --> 05:41.034
I'm comin' for ya, Billy.

06:01.837 --> 06:05.928
Everyone, please, if you're boarding
the train, you must have a ticket.

06:11.013 --> 06:12.848
I'm gonna need to see a ticket, ma'am.

06:15.217 --> 06:16.737
Sir!

06:25.961 --> 06:30.033
I'm sorry, your ticket, or your
money to buy one, or your life.

06:30.133 --> 06:31.635
Hickok?

06:31.735 --> 06:34.654
- Do I know you?
- Corporal Fred Finley.

06:34.754 --> 06:37.307
You know, reb uniforms, behind reb lines?

06:37.407 --> 06:39.543
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.

06:39.643 --> 06:42.212
Move out the way, please. Sir, excuse me.

06:42.312 --> 06:44.007
Forgive me, I'm... I'm desperate.

06:44.107 --> 06:46.917
Tickets, please, what's goin' on here?

06:47.017 --> 06:49.486
It seems my friend here
has misplaced his wallet.

06:49.586 --> 06:51.755
Yeah, lose it all the time.

06:51.855 --> 06:54.325
Well, I'm still gonna need a ticket, sir.

06:55.575 --> 06:58.431
Don't worry, I'll take care of his ticket.

07:05.334 --> 07:08.437
- A whiskey salesman?
- Yeah.

07:08.537 --> 07:11.531
Bourbon, rye, brandy...

07:11.840 --> 07:14.377
...through the whole Midwest clear to Omaha.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.480
Suits you down to a T...

07:17.180 --> 07:18.699
...Ted.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.818
You don't remember me, do ya?

07:21.918 --> 07:23.487
What?

07:23.587 --> 07:25.661
Don't remember my favorite corporal?

07:26.323 --> 07:28.926
You remember Mattie, my cousin?

07:29.626 --> 07:32.395
- Well...
- I introduced you to her.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.538
Mattie, God.

07:35.130 --> 07:36.757
Fred Finley.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.387
Bill Hickok.

08:07.763 --> 08:09.231
Whiskey.

08:09.331 --> 08:10.594
Be two bits.

08:10.694 --> 08:12.253
Okay.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.544
You ever had Kentucky bourbon?

08:20.644 --> 08:22.162
Sir.

08:23.963 --> 08:27.834
Name's Phil Poe,
proprietor of this establishment.

08:28.284 --> 08:30.437
Bill, Bill Hickok.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.710
Wild Bill Hickok?

08:33.809 --> 08:35.438
Been known to go by that name.

08:36.359 --> 08:39.577
Ben, get Mr. Hickok a bottle
of my private stock.

08:40.767 --> 08:43.090
Could I interest you in a game?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.157
Much obliged, but I...

08:46.257 --> 08:48.321
No buts, no buts.

08:48.737 --> 08:52.445
Well, I can resist anything but temptation.

08:53.475 --> 08:57.251
Well, we want you to feel at home,
Mr. Hickok. Enjoy your bourbon.

08:58.447 --> 09:00.115
And the game.

09:00.215 --> 09:02.670
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

09:11.126 --> 09:13.196
So that's the famous Wild Bill?

09:13.296 --> 09:16.581
Hell, he don't look
like he got a pot to piss in.

09:19.368 --> 09:22.406
Gentlemen, I seem to have
misplaced my wallet, so...

09:22.906 --> 09:25.391
...if it's all the same to you, then...

09:27.093 --> 09:29.296
...my marker is my word of honor.

09:30.146 --> 09:31.965
House rules.

09:36.051 --> 09:37.620
You callin'?

09:37.720 --> 09:40.774
I'm raising. 20 more.

09:44.392 --> 09:48.081
Wait, hold on, you're a goddamn cheater.

09:49.854 --> 09:52.502
You've been winnin'
every hand all night long.

09:52.802 --> 09:55.572
Now, hold on, son. This happens in poker.

09:55.672 --> 09:58.341
Even a blind hog finds
an acorn once in awhile.

09:58.441 --> 10:01.528
Yeah? Who the hell are you?

10:02.211 --> 10:05.081
Now, there's no need for that.
Put the gun down.

10:05.181 --> 10:07.884
You just... you have a lot
to learn about poker.

10:07.984 --> 10:10.020
I'd be happy to teach you.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.974
No, no, no, don't shoot him, Sam,
he's just a boy.

10:17.794 --> 10:19.379
Idiots.

10:24.139 --> 10:26.028
Good evening, gentlemen.

10:36.980 --> 10:38.816
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What?

10:38.916 --> 10:41.011
Which one's your horse?

10:41.111 --> 10:42.685
That one.

10:42.785 --> 10:44.371
Much obliged.

11:13.849 --> 11:16.254
Closer to the fire, so I can see you, please.

11:21.857 --> 11:23.927
What do you want, old man?

11:24.327 --> 11:27.581
You can start by puttin' that gun away.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.032
Name is George Knox, mayor of that town.

11:36.472 --> 11:40.394
I figured maybe we could just go
somewhere and talk for a while.

11:55.357 --> 11:57.645
It used to be quiet here.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.395
A place where people
could raise their youngins...

12:00.495 --> 12:02.924
...without the fear of a stray bullet.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.105
Things ain't so quiet anymore.

12:08.705 --> 12:11.169
Now, we could use someone with your skills...

12:11.269 --> 12:14.562
...to help us get this town
back to that place.

12:15.377 --> 12:18.746
How would you like to be marshal of Abilene?

12:19.949 --> 12:22.852
Why the hell would I wanna do
a crazy thing like that?

12:22.952 --> 12:26.737
The same reason you just interfered
in another man's quarrel...

12:27.357 --> 12:30.445
...and put yourself between him and a bullet.

12:31.727 --> 12:36.850
'Cause sometimes it takes
a good man to stop bad people.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.655
I ain't a good man.

12:44.406 --> 12:47.828
Son, every man's got his demons.

12:51.847 --> 12:53.850
How much does the job pay?

12:53.950 --> 12:56.349
A $100 a month.

12:57.552 --> 12:59.589
That's not nearly enough.

12:59.689 --> 13:05.210
150 and $10 extra for every man you arrest.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.665
What about each man I shoot?

13:08.765 --> 13:10.520
It ain't blood money.

13:10.620 --> 13:14.504
$10 for every man you arrest, not kill.

13:14.604 --> 13:16.490
Now, we got a deal?

13:18.940 --> 13:20.460
Deal.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.231
If you don't mind me asking...

13:28.134 --> 13:30.456
...what happened to your last marshal?

13:31.953 --> 13:33.473
Resigned.

13:34.139 --> 13:35.947
You mean he was killed?

13:38.745 --> 13:40.854
Well, that's gonna cost you a little extra.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.845
Say... a house and some new clothes?

13:46.468 --> 13:48.489
I think we can handle that.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.132
Marshal, all right.

14:22.437 --> 14:26.386
Now, you fine gentlemen let me know
if y'all need anything else, okay?

14:26.486 --> 14:28.311
Thank you, ma'am.

14:28.611 --> 14:30.463
Thank you, ma'am.

14:32.864 --> 14:34.830
Gentlemen, within a week...

14:34.930 --> 14:38.650
...Abilene will be an island
in the sea of Texas cattle...

14:38.750 --> 14:42.425
- ...and Texas humans.
- Will all due respect, mayor...

14:42.525 --> 14:46.829
...this is a good Christian town,
a God-fearin' town.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.899
For God's sakes,
get off your high horse, Jenkins.

14:49.999 --> 14:54.868
You and I both know that Abilene can teach
Sodom and Gomorrah a few lessons.

14:54.968 --> 14:59.459
But, Knox, hirin' a gunslinger,
you think that's the right move?

14:59.559 --> 15:01.495
Damn right it is.

15:05.914 --> 15:07.801
You sure are pretty.

15:08.735 --> 15:10.536
Damned if I ain't.

15:10.636 --> 15:12.719
You know, I can't seem to figure out...

15:12.819 --> 15:17.481
...how I ended up in here,
and you ended up out there.

15:17.744 --> 15:19.825
Didn't you steal my horse?

15:22.732 --> 15:26.820
Son, I'm gonna give you a word of advice.

15:27.502 --> 15:32.008
You're sittin' at the poker table, and you
can't see who the idiot is, it's you.

15:32.108 --> 15:34.677
I saved your life
by throwin' you in that box.

15:34.777 --> 15:36.664
You should be thankful.

15:38.010 --> 15:41.851
Yeah, just what did ya hit me with, anyway?

15:42.518 --> 15:44.120
Big ol' bottle.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.741
Scotch. Damn shame.

16:19.921 --> 16:21.941
Bang, got you!

16:25.230 --> 16:27.497
What the hell are you doin'?

16:27.597 --> 16:29.626
You followin' me around with this?

16:29.866 --> 16:32.301
I wanna be a lawman when I grow up!

16:32.401 --> 16:34.221
A lawman?

16:37.006 --> 16:38.638
Why aren't you in school?

16:39.108 --> 16:41.577
Don't you know nothin'? It's Saturday.

16:41.677 --> 16:43.263
Saturday?

16:44.913 --> 16:47.217
- Well, go on, get out of here.
- I want my gun!

16:47.317 --> 16:50.253
No, I'm keepin' your gun, I like it.

16:50.353 --> 16:52.937
I said I want my gun, you bastard!

17:00.268 --> 17:02.929
Hold up your hands, you son of a bitch!

17:05.300 --> 17:08.387
I saw what you did to that poor boy.

17:10.204 --> 17:11.941
You've run through your luck.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.922
Every breath you take from now on
is a personal present from me.

17:18.381 --> 17:21.784
You wouldn't murder a man
without givin' him a fair play, would you?

17:21.884 --> 17:23.684
I'm gonna learn ya a lesson.

17:24.987 --> 17:26.638
Can ya dance?

17:31.293 --> 17:33.563
You look awful pretty in that getup.

17:34.363 --> 17:38.435
Listen, why don't ya calm down
and I'll give you my guns?

17:39.135 --> 17:41.095
- Yeah.
- You like the sound of that?

17:41.195 --> 17:42.755
Yeah.

17:43.088 --> 17:44.658
Here.

17:49.645 --> 17:51.507
Son of a bitch.

17:55.050 --> 17:58.821
- Somebody give me a hand here.
- Yeah, I'll take charge here.

17:58.921 --> 18:00.256
Mr. Preacher.

18:00.356 --> 18:05.833
In addition to my holy duties,
I'm also the town undertaker.

18:08.163 --> 18:10.399
Well, that's handy, I guess.

18:10.499 --> 18:13.252
We are a God-fearin' town, Marshal.

18:13.352 --> 18:17.457
It's like the good book says,
waste not, want not.

18:21.777 --> 18:23.670
Sorry to disappoint you.

18:25.163 --> 18:26.982
Hoist him up.

18:27.082 --> 18:28.935
He's all yours.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.795
The good book also tells us that...

18:35.895 --> 18:38.879
...all things come to those who wait.

18:52.708 --> 18:56.012
You better be careful
shootin' people, Mr. Marshal.

18:56.112 --> 18:57.713
Sullivan's a good customer.

18:57.813 --> 19:00.283
Your good customer
just tried to bushwhack me.

19:00.383 --> 19:01.684
Sully's harmless.

19:01.784 --> 19:05.655
No one's harmless with a gun
and a belly full of liquor.

19:05.755 --> 19:09.759
From now on, you be sure you don't serve
a man more than he can handle.

19:09.859 --> 19:11.694
I just take orders, mister.

19:11.794 --> 19:16.299
Mr. Poe says the only question I ask is,
can they pay for their drinks?

19:16.399 --> 19:17.900
Welcome.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.636
I reckon congratulations are in order.

19:20.736 --> 19:24.774
Ben, pour our new marshal
a drink of the good stuff.

19:24.874 --> 19:27.944
It's all right, Ben. We'll drink this bottle.

19:28.044 --> 19:30.312
- No, no.
- What's the matter?

19:30.412 --> 19:32.615
Whiskey's whiskey, ain't it?

19:32.715 --> 19:36.435
- Well, I prefer my own brand.
- This is your brand.

19:36.535 --> 19:38.621
These are all your brands.

19:39.121 --> 19:42.343
Unless you're puttin' bad whiskey
into good bottles.

19:49.181 --> 19:52.023
How much you make a month, Marshal, 150?

19:52.885 --> 19:54.694
That ain't very much.

19:55.837 --> 19:58.244
Things are gonna change around here.

19:58.611 --> 20:01.050
First thing that's gonna change is...

20:01.310 --> 20:03.136
...this whiskey.

20:06.549 --> 20:09.619
I have a duty to the citizens in this town.

20:10.619 --> 20:13.306
Would $50 a month change your mind?

20:13.856 --> 20:18.057
You know, the second thing
that's gonna change, these cards.

20:18.526 --> 20:23.031
I had a sneaking suspicion that people
ain't been gettin' a square deal.

20:28.002 --> 20:29.872
You're a good man, Bill.

20:30.222 --> 20:32.071
I spotted that right off.

20:34.142 --> 20:36.396
What do ya say a $100 a month?

20:37.380 --> 20:41.381
What kind of a marshal would I be
if I didn't follow the letter of the law?

20:42.618 --> 20:46.975
I reckon 25% of the house
sounds about right, don't it?

20:51.627 --> 20:54.247
This offer is nonnegotiable.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.609
Well, you're a pragmatist, Bill.

21:06.709 --> 21:09.730
That's a quality that I admire in a man.

21:11.679 --> 21:15.418
Luck is a lady, and this one's on the house.

21:15.518 --> 21:17.939
Luck is female, but she ain't no lady.

21:20.121 --> 21:22.738
When the lights are out, neither am I.

21:25.126 --> 21:26.946
Hi, Marshal.

21:44.180 --> 21:47.366
- How many of 'em are there?
- Three.

21:47.466 --> 21:49.435
- Didn't mean to interrupt.
- Ma'am.

21:49.585 --> 21:52.028
Just here to escort you to Mr. Poe's.

21:52.688 --> 21:55.031
I'll come when I'm good and ready.

21:55.131 --> 21:58.235
- Yes, sir.
- Get out of here.

22:01.981 --> 22:03.800
Close the door!

22:10.054 --> 22:12.926
Like my new hotel? It's nice?

22:26.821 --> 22:28.257
Bang!

22:28.357 --> 22:31.360
- You again, you little scoundrel.
- Joey.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.363
Fine boy you have here.

22:34.463 --> 22:36.812
- Get out of here, Joey.
- Go on.

22:36.912 --> 22:39.719
That young hellion takes after his mother.

22:40.469 --> 22:44.017
I'm afraid she's overindulged the boy.
Let me introduce you. Gentlemen...

22:44.117 --> 22:46.375
...this is our new marshal, Mr. Bill Hickok.

22:46.475 --> 22:48.294
How do you do?

22:49.560 --> 22:54.586
I... hope that we can
continue our discussion.

22:55.783 --> 22:58.053
Scenery's better over there, isn't it?

22:58.653 --> 23:00.355
Yeah, well.

23:00.455 --> 23:04.345
Excuse me, ladies, I'd like
to introduce our new lawman to ya.

23:06.294 --> 23:10.984
And this beautiful creature is
my betrothed, Miss Mattie Lyles.

23:16.771 --> 23:19.287
Well, ladies...

23:19.387 --> 23:21.343
...most honored to make your acquaintances.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.946
I hope that you come
to see me as a protector...

23:24.046 --> 23:26.315
...and a friend in days to come.

23:26.815 --> 23:29.049
Please feel free to call upon me anytime.

23:34.522 --> 23:36.342
Excuse me.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.151
Hi, darlin'.

24:32.213 --> 24:35.248
Okay, can't say I didn't deserve that.

24:36.534 --> 24:38.583
I've been waitin' 10 years to do that.

24:42.557 --> 24:44.727
- You're a son of a bitch.
- What?

24:44.827 --> 24:47.313
You took off and never came back.

24:47.413 --> 24:49.631
You could've written at least once.

24:50.203 --> 24:52.034
I went to war, Mattie.

24:52.734 --> 24:54.403
What did you expect?

24:54.503 --> 24:57.399
I was dodging bullets,
left, right, and center.

24:57.499 --> 25:00.944
I didn't know where I was gonna live
from one day to another.

25:01.844 --> 25:03.897
Why am I not surprised?

25:09.984 --> 25:12.205
It's good to see you.

25:14.455 --> 25:15.942
How much?

25:17.158 --> 25:18.908
How much what?

25:19.008 --> 25:20.763
I know you, Bill...

25:20.863 --> 25:23.866
...$200 and you forget you ever knew me.

25:23.966 --> 25:25.785
Now, hold on.

25:26.401 --> 25:30.223
I gain nothin' by telling
your Mr. Poe anything.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.832
I'm pleased to see you so happy.

25:35.576 --> 25:38.814
300 for your silence and not a cent more.

25:38.914 --> 25:40.984
Now, you're hurtin' my feelings.

25:42.484 --> 25:45.387
When I was young and foolish...

25:45.487 --> 25:47.439
...I thought you were dashing...

25:47.539 --> 25:51.226
...and gallant, but now I see you
for what you really are.

25:51.326 --> 25:56.160
You're a liar. You're a live-for-today
hedonist with no ambition.

25:56.698 --> 25:58.551
That's not true.

26:01.670 --> 26:05.525
And you only have one particular skill.

26:12.146 --> 26:13.967
Killin' people.

26:36.571 --> 26:38.390
Stop here.

26:51.752 --> 26:53.607
Give us a moment, Jerry.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.721
What you frettin' about, Mattie?

27:07.561 --> 27:11.173
I just don't understand how they
can make a man like that marshal.

27:11.773 --> 27:15.644
I just wish you'd use your influence
on the town council...

27:15.744 --> 27:17.635
...get rid of Hickok.

27:21.649 --> 27:24.869
- Was he in the army with your husband?
- No.

27:25.319 --> 27:28.524
I don't know him. I just know his type.

27:28.624 --> 27:30.826
He only cares about four things...

27:30.926 --> 27:34.748
...shootin', drinkin', and gamblin',
and you can guess the last.

27:39.433 --> 27:42.692
I suppose I can guess the last.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.879
Don't you worry your pretty head
about it any longer.

27:50.779 --> 27:52.632
I'll take care of it.

27:53.981 --> 27:55.801
Let's go, Jerry.

28:21.876 --> 28:24.994
Sullivan! Rise and shine.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.301
Time to go home.

28:31.085 --> 28:34.427
- I am at home.
- Then go to work.

28:35.056 --> 28:36.876
I am at work.

28:38.793 --> 28:40.613
I'm the jailer.

28:42.630 --> 28:44.484
Well, that's handy.

28:46.033 --> 28:50.005
What about me? You know I have
a farm that needs plowin'.

28:50.105 --> 28:52.691
I'm gonna give you some more advice, son.

28:53.141 --> 28:56.960
Drinking, gambling, and shootin',
they don't mix...

28:57.060 --> 28:58.881
...speaking from personal experience.

28:58.981 --> 29:02.010
Best you stay there
till you've learned your lesson.

29:04.418 --> 29:06.238
I'll need money then.

29:06.888 --> 29:08.317
Money?

29:08.990 --> 29:10.809
What for?

29:11.025 --> 29:12.845
For breakfast.

29:13.261 --> 29:15.306
You need to feed the prisoner.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.171
On the other hand...

29:23.271 --> 29:27.209
...if as a result of my advice
to take alcohol only in moderation...

29:27.309 --> 29:30.142
...and to never pull a gun
at the poker table...

29:30.244 --> 29:32.548
...you promise not to do it again,
then I'll let you go...

29:32.848 --> 29:36.269
- ...but I'm keeping your gun.
- You can't keep my gun.

29:41.589 --> 29:43.859
You can't keep my gun, please.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.919
Sullivan, let that idiot out.

30:13.154 --> 30:14.974
May I help you...

30:15.890 --> 30:17.439
...Marshal?

30:20.194 --> 30:23.648
Yes, yes, of course, I...

30:24.098 --> 30:25.952
...I would like to buy a hat.

30:29.570 --> 30:34.243
- What kind of hat?
- Well, a lady's hat, but...

30:34.943 --> 30:37.161
...I don't know much about 'em, so...

30:38.061 --> 30:41.016
...I'd appreciate any suggestions
you might have, Mattie.

30:41.205 --> 30:43.626
You presume familiarity.

30:44.853 --> 30:48.267
You may call me, Mrs. Lyles, sir.

30:49.757 --> 30:51.610
Mrs. Lyles.

30:54.628 --> 30:56.717
You know, that name sounds familiar.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.802
I swear I've heard it somewhere before.

31:06.006 --> 31:08.189
Here. Take it.

31:08.289 --> 31:10.075
It's on the house.

31:10.175 --> 31:12.888
Take it and leave.

31:14.382 --> 31:18.470
No, no, no, I... I insist on paying.

31:30.431 --> 31:34.453
You know, this is a nice place
you have here...

31:35.536 --> 31:37.356
...Mrs. Poe.

31:40.541 --> 31:42.377
I know what you're thinkin'.

31:42.777 --> 31:46.633
And, yes, Philip did set me up
in this little shop...

31:47.882 --> 31:51.137
...and, yes, I am going to marry him...

31:53.086 --> 31:57.898
...so please just take your hat
and get out of here.

32:09.270 --> 32:11.358
I bought that hat for you, Mattie.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.358
Howdy, Bill.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.461
What?

32:50.541 --> 32:53.310
This shit kicker drew on me first.

32:54.248 --> 32:58.605
Look, I'm tellin' you it was a fair fight.
He got what was comin' to him.

33:02.357 --> 33:05.166
You just killed an unarmed boy, Slade.

33:22.676 --> 33:24.750
You take care of him, all right, Preacher?

33:24.850 --> 33:28.116
Don't you worry about
that one little bit, Marshal.

33:28.216 --> 33:30.853
I'll make sure he gets a first-class sendoff.

33:31.253 --> 33:33.086
I'm talkin' about the boy.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.244
Okay.

33:44.032 --> 33:46.684
Well, I'm gonna have to raise, boys.

33:52.474 --> 33:54.275
Goddamn, Hickok!

33:54.375 --> 33:56.796
I believe this belongs to you.

33:58.046 --> 34:00.900
Looks to me like he belongs to the devil now.

34:01.616 --> 34:04.486
You ordered this piece of horseshit
to shoot the sodbuster.

34:04.586 --> 34:07.656
Now why would I do that?
I didn't have no quarrel with the man.

34:07.756 --> 34:09.972
He didn't pull his gun on me.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.978
Slade had this comin' anyway. Goon!

34:14.079 --> 34:16.679
Come get this piece of shit off my pot.

34:18.299 --> 34:20.926
Have a seat, Hickok,
and I'll take your money.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.766
God, they never stop.

34:45.389 --> 34:46.779
Joey!

34:48.163 --> 34:49.715
Joey!

34:53.568 --> 34:55.409
Texas boys are here.

34:59.641 --> 35:02.083
Don't get yourself killed now!

35:30.003 --> 35:33.008
- Oh, God almighty.
- Doc!

35:33.608 --> 35:36.342
Hold your horses. I'm comin'.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.257
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.820
- Put him on.
- Yeah, he caught a bullet.

35:45.620 --> 35:48.256
- Where's the bullet?
- It's in his leg.

35:48.356 --> 35:49.874
Okay.

35:50.424 --> 35:53.292
Now, son, oh, God.

35:54.162 --> 35:57.132
Okay, son, now, we're gonna have
to pull the bullet out right away...

35:57.232 --> 35:59.568
...to stop the bleeding, okay?
So you gotta be brave.

35:59.668 --> 36:04.533
I can't give you anything to go to sleep.
You're just gonna have to gut it out, okay?

36:05.640 --> 36:08.143
You know what, we could give him a shot.

36:08.243 --> 36:09.744
Okay?

36:09.844 --> 36:12.598
- Whiskey? Really?
- Yeah.

36:15.749 --> 36:18.253
Forget it, come on. You look really tough.

36:18.553 --> 36:22.390
You'll be brave, be a good soldier. Okay?

36:22.490 --> 36:26.061
Just count to 40, okay? One, two.

36:26.161 --> 36:27.429
One, two, three.

36:27.529 --> 36:30.832
We're not goin' anywhere.
Grab his foot, hold his foot. Let's see.

36:30.932 --> 36:33.969
Joey, listen, I want you to listen to me.
I want you to listen to me real careful.

36:34.069 --> 36:37.072
Look at me, look at me. Why don't I
tell you about the time that I was...

36:37.172 --> 36:40.998
...scoutin' for my friend
General Custer in the black hills.

36:42.709 --> 36:45.714
I was far in advance of the column, okay?

36:46.114 --> 36:48.183
And I found myself cutoff by Cheyennes...

36:48.283 --> 36:51.587
...the most bloodthirsty savages
you ever had the displeasure to meet.

36:53.087 --> 36:58.093
Now, I managed to slip past 'em, and
they chased me into a dead-end canyon...

36:58.193 --> 37:00.362
...with a little narrow passageway
leadin' in...

37:00.462 --> 37:04.003
...and I knew that they could only
come through one man at a time, so...

37:04.103 --> 37:06.468
...I decided to make my stand there, okay?

37:06.568 --> 37:09.404
So I turn around, and I'm ready...

37:09.504 --> 37:11.352
...but they disappear.

37:12.322 --> 37:13.842
Silence.

37:14.875 --> 37:17.581
And bang! Gunfire starts.

37:17.681 --> 37:21.750
And you know who pops his head through?
A little ol' confederate boy, okay?

37:21.850 --> 37:24.219
He's movin' so slow...

37:24.319 --> 37:27.989
...I put a bullet right between
his... right between his eyes...

37:28.089 --> 37:29.650
...and...

37:30.383 --> 37:34.796
...his friends, they clamber over
the top of him to come through.

37:34.896 --> 37:37.383
And I drop another one and another one.

37:39.067 --> 37:40.885
And this...

37:41.668 --> 37:44.154
...I'm out of bullets then, okay?

37:44.672 --> 37:47.876
So I draw my knife,
and I back up against the far wall.

37:48.476 --> 37:51.564
By that time, they're crowdin' around me.

37:54.615 --> 37:56.469
What happened next?

37:58.485 --> 38:01.623
Well, what could I do? I was...

38:01.723 --> 38:05.344
...outgunned and outnumbered, out of ammo.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.696
I only had my knife.

38:07.796 --> 38:09.615
So what'd ya do?

38:14.202 --> 38:16.025
I pissed my pants, doc.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.035
Now bandage.

38:30.417 --> 38:32.254
You're doin' good.

38:32.354 --> 38:35.675
Just stay this quiet in here as you can.

38:37.157 --> 38:41.413
I tell ya one thing,
guns are good for business.

38:48.870 --> 38:50.389
George.

38:51.238 --> 38:53.259
Can I help ya, son?

38:58.513 --> 39:00.783
I'm guessin' you heard about young Joey.

39:01.783 --> 39:06.072
It ain't right that a grown boy can't
horse around without risking a bullet.

39:06.554 --> 39:09.870
And you're gonna tell me
how to keep that from happenin'?

39:19.233 --> 39:24.125
"The carrying of firearms within
city limits is strictly prohibited."

39:24.225 --> 39:25.807
No guns at all.

39:25.907 --> 39:29.781
You leave 'em at camp, or ya check 'em into
the Marshal's office on the way into town.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.501
You sure about this, son?

39:40.654 --> 39:44.259
Some folks ain't gonna be
too happy about this.

39:44.359 --> 39:46.211
Yeah, well...

39:46.627 --> 39:48.648
...they'll just have to live with it.

40:15.355 --> 40:18.526
Boss, you know boys
can't belly up to the bar...

40:18.626 --> 40:21.881
...if they're cuffed hand
and foot to the marshal's desk.

40:25.366 --> 40:27.317
Now where am I gonna sleep?

41:03.370 --> 41:08.529
Bill, I want you to know I'm a 100%
in favor of what you're tryin' to do.

41:08.910 --> 41:11.530
100% in principle...

41:12.639 --> 41:15.083
...but I think we need to be practical here.

41:15.183 --> 41:18.276
This ain't the only town
they can drive cattle to.

41:19.787 --> 41:22.040
My mind's made up, okay?

41:22.589 --> 41:26.445
There's no changin' it.
And that goes for you, too.

41:28.930 --> 41:31.754
Do I need to remind you of our arrangement?

41:34.018 --> 41:38.825
Ben, put a goddamn cork in that bottle
and sit it on its side facing me.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.905
I see a lot of you sons of bitches...

41:57.005 --> 41:59.861
...violatin' the no-guns ordinance.

42:00.261 --> 42:03.965
So I'm gonna explain it to you real simple...

42:04.065 --> 42:06.127
...by uncorking that bottle there.

42:21.047 --> 42:22.916
Anyone else beside me do that?

42:24.135 --> 42:26.371
If not, kindly head to the bar.

42:26.471 --> 42:28.838
Give your guns to Ben for safekeeping.

42:32.844 --> 42:35.684
I'd like to give it a try, Mr. Marshal.

42:50.043 --> 42:52.336
Put another cork in the bottle, Ben.

42:57.984 --> 42:59.804
Spin it.

43:16.336 --> 43:19.115
- What do they call you, son?
- Hardin...

43:19.215 --> 43:22.343
- ...John Wesley Hardin.
- You going somewhere?

43:22.443 --> 43:25.346
- Most likely somewhere.
- You best get back to somewhere.

43:25.446 --> 43:27.882
I don't know, I kinda like it here.

43:27.982 --> 43:29.852
Think I'll stay for a while.

43:30.952 --> 43:32.971
I recognize you now.

43:33.520 --> 43:36.591
You're not a John Wesley Hardin,
you're Wesley Clemmons.

43:36.691 --> 43:38.893
Folks call you Little Arkansas.

43:39.393 --> 43:41.629
That's a new one, Little Arkansas.

43:41.729 --> 43:45.551
You know, you might almost be as fast as me.

43:47.501 --> 43:49.069
Ben...

43:49.169 --> 43:51.372
...pour Arkansas a drink on me.

43:52.172 --> 43:55.610
Rest of you, keep givin'
your guns to the bartender.

43:55.710 --> 43:57.797
Sully will pick 'em up later.

44:16.096 --> 44:18.177
Can I do somethin' for you?

44:20.734 --> 44:25.106
Yeah, Mayor, you can do somethin'
about that young Marshal of yours.

44:25.206 --> 44:27.708
Boy's runnin' all of
my customers out of town.

44:27.808 --> 44:30.830
Now, listen to me, you son of a bitch.

44:32.279 --> 44:36.915
Ain't no one stoppin' them boys
from drinkin' the swill you call whiskey.

44:38.051 --> 44:41.139
Now, you listen to me.

44:42.989 --> 44:47.663
If it weren't for my businesses,
you wouldn't have no goddamn town.

44:48.262 --> 44:51.683
You'd just blow away in the dust.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.838
Ain't right messin' with a man's livelihood.

44:56.938 --> 44:59.373
And I'd hate to see your young marshal...

44:59.473 --> 45:02.136
...meet with some unhealthy accident...

45:02.236 --> 45:04.517
...while he's performing his duties.

45:05.213 --> 45:07.799
I stand by my decision.

45:08.531 --> 45:11.153
Now get your ass off my property.

45:12.836 --> 45:15.494
Before I put a bullet in you.

45:23.713 --> 45:26.567
I say we teach this yankee dandy a lesson.

45:26.667 --> 45:29.637
Ride out to camp, pick up the spare guns.

45:29.737 --> 45:31.372
And a strong rope.

45:31.472 --> 45:34.526
Invite Wild Bill to a little necktie party.

45:51.591 --> 45:53.461
Good afternoon.

45:53.561 --> 45:55.213
Can I help you?

45:55.829 --> 45:58.499
We don't much like your new ordinances.

45:58.799 --> 46:01.053
Yeah, we don't much like you.

46:02.537 --> 46:04.389
Is that so?

46:05.438 --> 46:07.274
That's so.

46:07.374 --> 46:10.953
We reckon it's time
you leave Abilene for good.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.519
The next person to move, I cut in half.

46:37.804 --> 46:41.009
You boys put your tails between your legs...

46:41.509 --> 46:43.595
...and you get out of here.

46:44.644 --> 46:45.751
Get.

46:48.616 --> 46:51.067
Yeah, we'll be seein' you real soon.

46:53.287 --> 46:55.341
You take care now, Yankee.

47:22.682 --> 47:24.686
Hi, darlin', how was your day?

47:25.386 --> 47:27.406
It was all right, Mattie.

47:29.189 --> 47:32.477
- How was yours?
- It was good.

47:33.126 --> 47:35.047
I see ya found 'em.

47:36.496 --> 47:38.316
The pearls.

47:42.571 --> 47:45.173
I must've taken 'em off when I was cleanin'.

47:46.073 --> 47:49.487
Well, you should be more careful.

47:52.830 --> 47:54.635
Allow me.

48:03.123 --> 48:04.642
There...

48:04.991 --> 48:07.045
...back where they belong.

48:08.396 --> 48:11.402
Now what are you so excited about, son?

48:11.502 --> 48:15.693
You should've seen him!
Wild Bill took on a 100 men!

48:16.169 --> 48:18.173
He's one tough fella.

48:18.773 --> 48:20.625
A 100 men, you say?

48:48.834 --> 48:50.655
Don't move a muscle.

48:55.675 --> 48:57.763
You used to like it when I moved.

49:12.759 --> 49:15.046
<i>I don't know if you're aware of it, but...</i>

49:17.163 --> 49:19.579
...you're a hero in Joey's eyes.

49:26.306 --> 49:28.159
Do me a favor.

49:30.677 --> 49:32.531
Tell 'em not to be like you.

49:39.018 --> 49:40.913
I'll walk you home.

49:44.425 --> 49:45.943
Why?

49:46.659 --> 49:48.672
Who are you tryin' to protect?

49:52.054 --> 49:53.618
Me or Poe?

49:57.070 --> 49:58.890
You stay down.

50:11.434 --> 50:12.987
Goddammit.

50:39.913 --> 50:41.766
Give me two.

50:43.149 --> 50:44.961
Mr. Hardin...

50:45.061 --> 50:47.317
...you're pretty fast with a gun.

50:49.188 --> 50:51.042
So I've been told.

50:53.026 --> 50:55.463
From what I saw, you may be the fastest.

50:55.563 --> 50:57.815
You may be the best.

50:58.698 --> 51:00.585
I'm gonna take two.

51:01.234 --> 51:04.672
What are you gonna do
if Wild Bill asks you for your guns?

51:05.272 --> 51:07.292
Well, he ain't asked yet.

51:10.076 --> 51:13.564
These drovers, all from the south...

51:14.414 --> 51:16.300
...Texas mostly...

51:17.250 --> 51:20.505
...and they don't much cotton
to Yankee lawmen.

51:21.688 --> 51:25.526
I'm just sayin' if somethin'
was to happen to Wild Bill...

51:26.126 --> 51:27.979
...we'd need a new marshal.

51:33.766 --> 51:37.004
You want me to kill Wild Bill for nothin'?

51:37.104 --> 51:39.307
You never get somethin' for nothin'.

51:40.307 --> 51:43.360
No, there's a reward...

51:44.677 --> 51:46.764
...$500 reward.

51:47.180 --> 51:49.434
Isn't that ironic?

51:50.149 --> 51:51.969
A bounty...

51:53.086 --> 51:54.972
...on a lawman.

51:56.789 --> 51:58.609
You in?

52:00.827 --> 52:04.283
If you're so anxious to see Wild Bill dead...

52:05.832 --> 52:07.747
...why don't ya kill him yourself?

52:09.802 --> 52:12.006
If you want somethin' done right...

52:13.006 --> 52:14.893
...you oughta hire the best.

52:21.981 --> 52:24.219
You know, somethin' tells me, Poe...

52:25.019 --> 52:27.072
...you're not an honest man.

52:33.126 --> 52:36.105
Let's just say, I ain't easy to beat.

52:49.175 --> 52:51.979
It's time to fish or cut bait.

52:52.079 --> 52:55.686
Somethin's gotta be done
about Little Arkansas.

52:57.183 --> 53:00.316
The son of a bitch is wearin'
his guns in plain view.

53:02.188 --> 53:04.276
You can harness a mule...

53:05.858 --> 53:08.079
...but you teach a horse to run.

53:12.131 --> 53:13.695
<i>Let's...</i>

53:13.795 --> 53:17.006
...make this drink
for long nights of no rest.

53:23.576 --> 53:25.379
Little Arkansas...

53:25.779 --> 53:27.615
...I'm callin' you out.

53:28.315 --> 53:30.402
I'll be in the street waitin'.

53:35.154 --> 53:36.737
Well...

53:36.837 --> 53:39.441
...sorry about that rude interruption.

53:41.761 --> 53:43.613
Save the last dance for me.

54:03.851 --> 54:05.470
Drop your guns...

54:06.119 --> 54:08.206
...or I'm gonna arrest you.

54:09.689 --> 54:11.576
You want my guns?

54:13.126 --> 54:14.645
Okay.

54:15.962 --> 54:17.781
Take 'em.

54:18.764 --> 54:21.397
What you lack in sense, you...

54:21.497 --> 54:23.972
...certainly make up for in gumption.

54:24.772 --> 54:26.774
Don't you know anythin'?

54:27.274 --> 54:29.480
I invented the road agent's spin.

54:31.924 --> 54:34.337
I didn't know you were that old, Marshal.

54:35.516 --> 54:38.419
Well, it's a funny thing.

54:38.519 --> 54:40.404
Older I get...

54:41.187 --> 54:42.990
...the more I learn.

54:43.290 --> 54:45.526
Well, if you'd like to keep learnin'...

54:45.626 --> 54:47.794
...I'd holster that pistol of yours.

54:47.894 --> 54:50.133
Notice my hammer tied back?

54:50.233 --> 54:53.968
If something should happen
to cause my thumb to slip...

54:54.068 --> 54:56.928
...you will catch a bullet
right between your eyes.

54:59.405 --> 55:02.709
Well, I can't see what good it's gonna
do me to surrender my guns...

55:02.809 --> 55:05.239
...if you're just gonna go ahead
and shoot me in the back...

55:05.319 --> 55:07.334
...the second I turn and walk away.

55:07.434 --> 55:09.717
You have been misinformed, sir.

55:10.267 --> 55:12.321
I never shoot a man in the back.

55:16.350 --> 55:18.238
How 'bout a compromise?

55:19.159 --> 55:20.927
What do you say to a drink?

55:27.550 --> 55:29.387
I say all right.

55:47.419 --> 55:50.624
You know, there's a rumor
going around about you...

55:51.124 --> 55:54.448
...says that you were
a Yankee spy during the war.

55:56.462 --> 55:58.483
It was a stupid war.

56:03.482 --> 56:05.151
Well...

56:05.251 --> 56:08.390
...you know the only way you're gonna
get these guns off me, Marshal...

56:08.490 --> 56:10.327
...is if ya kill me.

56:10.843 --> 56:12.347
I'm considerin' it.

56:15.615 --> 56:17.460
If I let you loose...

56:17.880 --> 56:22.556
...pretty soon every bowlegged son of
a bitch is gonna be wearin' his guns, too.

56:22.656 --> 56:24.509
I can't allow that.

56:28.394 --> 56:31.682
I understand your problem. I do.

56:31.782 --> 56:33.183
It's just...

56:33.994 --> 56:36.409
...I ain't ready to leave town yet...

56:37.370 --> 56:40.275
...and I sure as hell
ain't takin' these guns off.

56:43.976 --> 56:47.247
- You remind me of someone.
- Well, he sounds handsome, who?

56:47.347 --> 56:51.603
It's not important.
The point is, you got potential.

56:52.585 --> 56:55.639
- You just might do.
- Do what?

57:12.571 --> 57:14.626
You want me to be a lawman?

57:16.675 --> 57:18.746
Pay is a $100 a month...

57:19.146 --> 57:21.715
...a lot more than a drover makes.

57:21.815 --> 57:24.084
What do ya say, Little Arkansas?

57:24.634 --> 57:27.589
Well, I say Poe offered me $500...

57:27.689 --> 57:29.703
...for just one day of work.

57:32.124 --> 57:33.665
There's two ways...

57:33.765 --> 57:37.025
...you're leavin' this office
wearin' those guns of yours...

57:38.231 --> 57:40.050
...feet first...

57:40.299 --> 57:42.151
...or wearin' that badge.

57:56.682 --> 57:58.736
Can I ask you somethin', Marshal?

57:59.785 --> 58:01.588
Why do you call me Arkansas?

58:01.688 --> 58:05.176
'Cause if you were John Wesley Hardin,
we'd have to hang you.

58:06.692 --> 58:08.061
Arkansas it is.

58:08.161 --> 58:12.766
I usually take a different route on these
patrols, keep the bushwhackers guessin'.

58:12.866 --> 58:16.703
Why the shotgun? Seems to me a rifle
would be a little more accurate.

58:16.803 --> 58:19.906
Well, this here's what I call
preventative medicine.

58:20.006 --> 58:23.710
Sawed-off filled with blue whistles
is a mighty fine deterrent.

58:23.810 --> 58:27.231
Well, I've never had to shoot
twice at the same man.

58:28.115 --> 58:30.117
There's somethin' you gotta
learn about gunfightin'.

58:30.217 --> 58:31.585
Yeah, what's that?

58:31.685 --> 58:34.921
No matter how fast you are,
there's always someone faster.

58:35.021 --> 58:39.288
The more you use your gun, the sooner
you're gonna run into that man.

58:45.664 --> 58:48.739
I reckon I still got some time
before I meet that man.

58:55.911 --> 58:58.712
Last chance, hand 'em over, Arkansas.

58:58.812 --> 59:01.047
Come get it, Marshal!

59:30.643 --> 59:32.660
You wanna come upstairs?

59:33.812 --> 59:35.700
Not tonight, darlin'.

59:36.982 --> 59:38.836
Much obliged.

59:55.734 --> 59:57.215
Consider it done.

01:00:19.727 --> 01:00:24.131
There's a lot of vagrancy in this part
of town. Keep your eyes skinned.

01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:28.235
The lawman has no friends
and few sympathizers.

01:00:28.335 --> 01:00:30.937
A momentary benevolence can prove fatal.

01:00:31.037 --> 01:00:33.540
I don't intend to die
of an excess of benevolence.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.492
Well, I don't think you got...

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.283
You see him?

01:00:43.383 --> 01:00:45.236
See him, I got him.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:49.573
You can't see him?

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:52.777
Yeah, yeah, I can see him.

01:01:11.243 --> 01:01:13.313
You know this dandy here?

01:01:13.413 --> 01:01:15.048
Yeah, I know him.

01:01:15.148 --> 01:01:18.437
Well, we're lucky he's about
as accurate a shooter as you.

01:01:21.488 --> 01:01:23.777
You just killed an old man, Marshal.

01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:29.580
Time for you to meet your maker.

01:01:43.175 --> 01:01:45.639
I'll see you in hell, Hickok!

01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:01.239
I wanna help the Marshal patrol!

01:02:07.466 --> 01:02:10.117
I want you to stay away from Wild Bill.

01:02:10.217 --> 01:02:14.174
You are not to see or speak
to that man again. You hear me?

01:02:14.274 --> 01:02:16.126
Do you hear me?

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:28.252
Whenever I look into a light of any kind...

01:02:28.955 --> 01:02:33.239
...it's edged with halos,
bright as January sun dogs.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.680
Well, ya have a film...

01:02:38.697 --> 01:02:40.517
...over your eyes...

01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:44.589
...and it'll be all right for a while...

01:02:45.954 --> 01:02:47.991
...but in five years...

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.628
In five years what?

01:02:53.413 --> 01:02:55.266
Total blindness.

01:02:57.784 --> 01:02:59.653
I can't help you...

01:03:00.003 --> 01:03:02.423
...but you can help yourself.

01:03:04.256 --> 01:03:08.401
You're at a point where you can
make a decision, and you must...

01:03:08.501 --> 01:03:10.545
...make a decision.

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:13.090
You can take the path...

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:17.037
...of a boy, reckless
and careless and stupid...

01:03:19.271 --> 01:03:21.959
...or you can take a higher road...

01:03:25.244 --> 01:03:27.264
...and become a man.

01:03:28.647 --> 01:03:30.684
Become a man by...

01:03:30.884 --> 01:03:32.696
...plowin' fields?

01:03:33.286 --> 01:03:35.817
- Is that what you're suggesting?
- Look, Bill...

01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:38.391
...get an easier profession...

01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:41.550
...start leading a different kind of a life.

01:03:41.828 --> 01:03:45.432
This is all I've been good at
my whole life, doc. What am I gonna do?

01:03:45.532 --> 01:03:48.001
You cannot ignore this, Bill.

01:03:48.501 --> 01:03:53.357
You must not ignore it,
'cause it isn't gonna go away.

01:03:55.324 --> 01:03:57.160
All right.

01:03:57.676 --> 01:04:01.081
I'd appreciate it if you kept
this information to yourself.

01:04:01.181 --> 01:04:05.143
You're a patient. I'm a doctor.
Strictly confidential.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:15.398
This stays confidential, or your wife's
gonna end up a widow, doc.

01:04:18.698 --> 01:04:20.667
I'm serious, doc.

01:04:20.767 --> 01:04:24.771
I seen you with the drinking.
When you drink, you talk.

01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:27.040
You wear a badge.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.045
I'm a doctor.
It's strictly confidential, trust me.

01:04:32.545 --> 01:04:34.497
I took an oath.

01:04:34.597 --> 01:04:36.127
Okay...

01:04:36.227 --> 01:04:39.891
...well, you remember your oath,
and you keep your mouth shut.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.941
Thanks for the good news.

01:05:04.513 --> 01:05:06.580
I got somethin' I want you all to do.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.335
I want you all to spread the word
that that son of a bitch is moon-blind.

01:05:17.255 --> 01:05:19.477
He can't see in the goddamn dark.

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:28.068
- Hello, Fred.
- Mr. Poe.

01:05:28.168 --> 01:05:30.053
Moon-blind.

01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:35.208
- Can ya handle that?
- Yeah, boss. We got that.

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:37.160
Go on.

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:42.349
- How are you, Fred?
- Very good, sir.

01:05:42.449 --> 01:05:44.268
Name your poison.

01:05:45.517 --> 01:05:49.294
Well, I'll have...
a barrel of the old Kentuckian...

01:05:49.856 --> 01:05:54.691
...and then, half-dozen barrels of the usual.

01:05:54.793 --> 01:05:56.660
One old Kentuckian and...

01:05:57.228 --> 01:05:59.539
...just... just a half-dozen barrels?

01:06:05.938 --> 01:06:07.825
Half dozen, Fred.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.510
Say, Mr. Poe...

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:15.286
...did a Bill Hickok come through here
recently? They call him... Wild Bill.

01:06:17.082 --> 01:06:19.052
Name sounds familiar.

01:06:19.152 --> 01:06:22.956
Well, Hickok was acquainted
to a relative of mine...

01:06:23.756 --> 01:06:25.959
...a Miss Mattie Silks.

01:06:26.059 --> 01:06:28.451
She was engaged to some
fancy fella, if I remember.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:31.662
Mr. Poe's also engaged,
but the lady's name is Lyles...

01:06:31.762 --> 01:06:34.834
- ...Mattie Lyles.
- Lyles?

01:06:34.934 --> 01:06:37.221
Well, that was Mattie's mother's name.

01:06:38.438 --> 01:06:40.290
Thank you, Mr. Poe.

01:07:01.927 --> 01:07:03.814
What do you want?

01:07:05.097 --> 01:07:06.998
Well, I...

01:07:07.098 --> 01:07:09.169
...I brought a present for the boy.

01:07:09.569 --> 01:07:12.606
A walking stick, useful for getting around.

01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:17.164
Also, useful against bloodthirsty savages.

01:07:19.644 --> 01:07:22.098
Wow, thanks!

01:07:23.448 --> 01:07:25.149
You're welcome.

01:07:27.219 --> 01:07:30.039
And for the lady of the house,
fresh-cut flowers...

01:07:30.139 --> 01:07:32.009
...all the way from Kansas City.

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:36.057
Joey, give it back, it's dangerous.

01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:39.411
- Mom.
- Now!

01:07:39.511 --> 01:07:41.384
Yes, ma'am.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.470
Tend to your chores.

01:07:44.303 --> 01:07:46.213
Do as your mother says, boy.

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:48.158
Yes, sir.

01:07:52.644 --> 01:07:55.915
Your flowers are also unwelcome
and a mistake.

01:07:56.015 --> 01:07:58.685
You're the one makin' a mistake, Mattie.

01:07:58.785 --> 01:08:01.254
You can't marry that man. I'm begging you.

01:08:01.354 --> 01:08:04.557
Well, it's my mistake,
and it ain't my first one either.

01:08:04.657 --> 01:08:07.727
As I recall, I was your first... mistake.

01:08:07.827 --> 01:08:11.271
I'm not proud of that, or the life I led...

01:08:11.371 --> 01:08:13.984
...but that all ended once I had Joey.

01:08:15.534 --> 01:08:17.571
I still care for you, Mattie.

01:08:18.571 --> 01:08:20.337
I know you care for me.

01:08:36.087 --> 01:08:37.941
You need to leave.

01:08:39.357 --> 01:08:41.178
Poe will be here soon.

01:08:42.426 --> 01:08:44.852
Whatever shortcomin's he may have...

01:08:47.733 --> 01:08:49.586
...he's punctual.

01:08:52.804 --> 01:08:54.892
What about last night?

01:08:59.711 --> 01:09:01.598
It never happened.

01:09:14.926 --> 01:09:16.447
Mattie.

01:10:01.707 --> 01:10:03.093
Sit down.

01:10:13.218 --> 01:10:16.108
Had a long talk
with an old friend of yours today.

01:10:17.707 --> 01:10:19.262
Fred Finley.

01:10:23.195 --> 01:10:25.482
So, tell me, Miss Lyles...

01:10:26.398 --> 01:10:28.602
...or is it Miss Silks...

01:10:29.167 --> 01:10:31.807
...how exactly...

01:10:32.868 --> 01:10:35.110
...did your husband get killed?

01:10:36.074 --> 01:10:37.961
What battle?

01:10:41.313 --> 01:10:42.820
Little Round Top.

01:10:45.818 --> 01:10:47.870
No more lies!

01:10:53.726 --> 01:10:57.397
- You bastard.
- That's the only bastard around here...

01:10:57.497 --> 01:10:59.783
...and I raised him as my own.

01:11:05.904 --> 01:11:07.725
You know what, Mattie?

01:11:09.074 --> 01:11:11.344
I'll give you a job at the Bull's Head.

01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:15.233
I can always use
another good whore down there.

01:11:17.483 --> 01:11:18.985
- Come, baby.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

01:11:19.085 --> 01:11:21.971
It's okay, it's okay.

01:11:22.354 --> 01:11:24.208
I'm sorry he hit you.

01:11:49.047 --> 01:11:51.541
I didn't know you
were the prince of pistoleers.

01:11:56.855 --> 01:11:59.259
I better not find out this came from you.

01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:11.735
You're crowdin' me, Bill.

01:12:14.339 --> 01:12:16.610
And I don't like to be crowded.

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:19.430
I don't like to be lied to.

01:12:21.846 --> 01:12:23.667
You lyin' to me?

01:12:27.335 --> 01:12:28.905
No.

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:33.576
Good.

01:12:41.414 --> 01:12:43.373
Can I help you, son?

01:12:54.779 --> 01:12:57.840
I think my demons
have finally caught up with me.

01:13:13.481 --> 01:13:16.303
Every man has demons, son.

01:13:23.808 --> 01:13:26.195
A man's demons...

01:13:26.295 --> 01:13:28.114
...though quiet...

01:13:29.347 --> 01:13:31.691
...are never quite silent.

01:13:36.155 --> 01:13:37.761
<i>She was my light...</i>

01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:41.278
...the thing that kept
the demons in the dark.

01:13:43.446 --> 01:13:46.032
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:13:47.499 --> 01:13:51.154
Only God can forgive you now,
you son of a bitch.

01:14:03.381 --> 01:14:06.002
No one can run forever, son.

01:14:07.619 --> 01:14:10.556
You quit, you surrender...

01:14:11.456 --> 01:14:14.985
...they'll dog your heels
till the day you die.

01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:18.295
But not if you face it.

01:14:21.467 --> 01:14:25.322
Now ask yourself
which you'd rather live with.

01:14:55.734 --> 01:14:57.320
I'm sorry.

01:15:04.576 --> 01:15:06.449
Where is he?

01:15:07.228 --> 01:15:08.998
Please don't.

01:15:10.248 --> 01:15:11.651
Please.

01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:14.884
Let's go, we have to go. Get your things.

01:15:17.957 --> 01:15:19.476
Keep your heads down!

01:15:47.786 --> 01:15:49.597
We must've got him.

01:16:10.158 --> 01:16:12.818
Guns are not allowed in town no more.

01:16:13.112 --> 01:16:15.198
That ain't no law anymore.

01:16:17.767 --> 01:16:19.970
There's a new lawman in town.

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.017
Tickets, please.

01:16:34.899 --> 01:16:36.719
Tickets, please.

01:16:37.002 --> 01:16:41.607
Listen, when you get to Wichita,
you seek out a man named Earp, okay?

01:16:41.707 --> 01:16:44.744
He's a good man. He'll take care of you.

01:16:45.344 --> 01:16:47.239
Tickets, please.

01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:51.053
Come with us, Bill.

01:16:53.419 --> 01:16:55.271
You know I can't.

01:16:58.066 --> 01:16:59.893
I have to finish this, Mattie.

01:17:00.493 --> 01:17:02.519
I've been runnin' my entire life.

01:17:03.746 --> 01:17:05.816
You're still runnin'.

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:10.245
It's time for you to hang up your guns.

01:17:15.273 --> 01:17:17.159
If you stay...

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:20.507
...we can't wait for you.

01:17:24.416 --> 01:17:26.756
I'll wait for you, Wild Bill.

01:17:29.955 --> 01:17:32.175
You do as your mother says, boy.

01:17:37.128 --> 01:17:38.848
I know why you're goin' back.

01:17:40.432 --> 01:17:42.911
You're goin' back 'cause you're a hero.

01:17:44.345 --> 01:17:45.955
No, son.

01:17:46.938 --> 01:17:49.143
I'm gonna back 'cause I'm a coward.

01:17:50.643 --> 01:17:53.330
Sometimes it takes more courage to walk away.

01:17:55.747 --> 01:17:57.400
You be a man...

01:17:57.982 --> 01:18:00.753
...take care of your mother for me, okay?

01:18:01.053 --> 01:18:03.089
Tickets, please.

01:18:06.841 --> 01:18:08.728
You got me, sir.

01:18:32.467 --> 01:18:34.287
He's my hero.

01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:39.403
He's your daddy.

01:19:18.356 --> 01:19:20.442
You ain't gonna try to stop me, are ya?

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:22.801
No.

01:19:22.901 --> 01:19:24.795
Reckon you'll want this.

01:19:53.798 --> 01:19:55.818
Poe!

01:20:02.073 --> 01:20:04.888
Wouldn't shoot me in the back,
would ya, Hickok?

01:20:10.948 --> 01:20:12.802
Guess not.

01:20:24.428 --> 01:20:27.857
$500 to the man that kills Wild Bill.

01:22:02.628 --> 01:22:04.412
I'll show you wild, Hickok.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.386
Wild Bill, my ass!

01:22:12.137 --> 01:22:14.023
I'll show ya wild!

01:22:15.074 --> 01:22:17.227
You're not so wild, Hickok!

01:22:19.545 --> 01:22:22.231
Yeah, you piece of shit!

01:22:23.448 --> 01:22:24.967
Goddammit.

01:23:26.811 --> 01:23:28.638
I'm done running.
