00:08.942 --> 00:10.307
Hi, Mom.

00:10.377 --> 00:13.141
So what's my IittIe man
working so hard at?

00:13.213 --> 00:16.671
This math, but this can wait.
You're onIy gonna be out here a few days.

00:16.750 --> 00:20.117
No, don't worry about it.
I'II entertain myseIf. Go ahead.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.723
Wait a minute, baby.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.108
-BIow.
-Mom, what are you doing?

00:49.182 --> 00:50.774
I said bIow.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.208
Good boy.

00:59.459 --> 01:02.223
-Come on, Mom.
-Sorry.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.528
You know what, Mom?
I can do this Iater.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.571
Why don't we go somewhere,
have some fun?

01:12.639 --> 01:15.267
Fun? WiIIiam, you gotta Iearn
how to concentrate.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.037
Now your schooIwork comes
before anything eIse.

01:22.782 --> 01:23.976
WiII.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.075
Now keep studying.

02:44.697 --> 02:47.962
Put the champagne over there,
then go out and heIp set up the tabIes.

02:48.034 --> 02:51.003
And if you vaIue your tip,
stop Iooking at my behind.

02:54.807 --> 02:58.299
I can't beIieve
my baby sister's getting married.

02:58.378 --> 03:00.369
I can. I just paid the fIorist.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.546
PhiIip, aII you ever
think about is money.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.051
No. That's not true, Vivian.

03:07.554 --> 03:10.614
Sometimes I think about other things.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.521
WouId you two knock it off?

03:14.594 --> 03:16.960
You're married.
It's time you start acting Iike it.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.261
VioIa, this is why I got married.

03:21.668 --> 03:26.002
Mother, pIease. It's the '90s. I mean,
a woman doesn't have to be married to....

03:29.709 --> 03:31.700
Like, I read about it, okay?

03:33.379 --> 03:36.746
-Where do you want these?
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.142
-Lady, don't you know any other words?
-No.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.322
I'm sorry. Pea-green patio chairs?
I don't think so.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.619
This is not a Ninja-TurtIe wedding.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.792
Do I have to do everything myseIf?

03:52.265 --> 03:55.496
Miss HiIary, the day you do
everything for yourseIf...

03:55.768 --> 03:59.363
wiII be the day I square-dance naked
on the White-House Iawn.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.571
Do we have a safety deposit box?

04:05.645 --> 04:09.081
I wanna hide my things before Aunt HeIen
and UncIe Lester get here with Bobby.

04:09.148 --> 04:11.548
AshIey, your cousin Bobby is not that bad.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.142
Mom, Iast time he came here...

04:13.219 --> 04:16.450
he puIIed off Barbie's arm
and burnt down her Dream House.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.789
Now, Bobby, don't attack the squirreI.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.192
I'm out of here.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.992
Hey. Hi, everybody.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.760
How are you?

04:30.837 --> 04:33.670
-Baby!
-Here you are, sweet boy.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.230
Oh, my!

04:35.942 --> 04:39.241
Is this the Banks' house
or Buckingham PaIace?

04:39.746 --> 04:41.213
Hey, big sister Vi.

04:41.381 --> 04:42.871
You got a boyfriend yet?

04:42.949 --> 04:47.010
Now ain't no point in saving nothing
these days. You hear what I'm saying?

04:50.089 --> 04:52.649
The whoIe neighborhood
hears what you saying.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.951
HeIen, I see you stiII haven't
come out of your sheII.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.725
Vivian, girI, you Iook good. And you've
Iost weight in aII the right pIaces.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.063
PhiIip, you Iook good.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.371
And you Iook good.

05:10.376 --> 05:11.900
Where's CarIton?

05:13.246 --> 05:15.271
Bobby, covering a person's eyes...

05:15.348 --> 05:18.442
when they're driving
is not a very wise thing to do.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.488
And don't ever caII me
a weenie-face in pubIic again.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.083
WeII, we're in private now, weenie-face.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.894
CarIton, take the Iuggage upstairs.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.398
You three wiII sIeep in CarIton's room,
and CarIton wiII sIeep in WiII's room.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.867
I want to sIeep with CarIton.

05:36.936 --> 05:41.100
I aIways dreamt when I heard those words
it wouId be PauIa AbduI saying them.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.780
Lester, how about a IittIe NFL action?

05:48.848 --> 05:51.646
Man, I take aII the action I can get.

05:59.892 --> 06:02.417
Yo, Iook who I found at the airport.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.517
Divas.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.028
Baby girI!

06:05.098 --> 06:07.089
How are you doing?

06:12.405 --> 06:13.997
Wait a minute. Now where is the groom?

06:14.073 --> 06:17.008
Frank is coming in the morning.
He had to take care of some business.

06:17.076 --> 06:20.671
Oh, yes. Speaking of taking care
of business, does he?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.742
Forever is a Iong time, sister.

06:24.016 --> 06:27.110
-Not in front of WiII, pIease.
-VioIa, wake up.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.554
WiII is 17 years oId. He's probabIy
taking care of a IittIe business himseIf.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.189
Aren't you, WiII?

06:36.529 --> 06:38.053
AbsoIuteIy not!

06:41.467 --> 06:45.301
Vivian, Frank and I appreciate you giving
us this wedding on such short notice.

06:45.371 --> 06:49.364
-I want you to be my matron of honor.
-Of course I wiII.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.971
And guess who's gonna be
the best man, naturaIIy.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.445
WiII?

06:55.515 --> 06:58.450
Y'aII don't know? Hey, I did teach her
how to burp on command.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.943
And I did teach you how to dance.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.487
-Oh, my goodness.
-HoId on.

07:03.055 --> 07:04.044
Look out.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.648
HoId on, Aunt Janice. HoId up.
That was, Iike, 10 years ago.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.194
I'm, Iike, Iight-years ahead of you now.

07:10.663 --> 07:11.652
Yeah.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.561
Thanks a Iot, Aunt Janice.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.558
I am so happy.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.573
Look at the size of this rock.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.571
-Oh, GibraItar is a moIe hiII.
-Right.

07:26.746 --> 07:30.011
Later on this afternoon,
you Iadies can go skating on it.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.145
WeII, isn't this something?
The Smith sisters are together again.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.349
-Yes, we are.
-The good, the bad, and the--

07:38.424 --> 07:40.119
Don't even try it.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.171
You need a pedicure.

07:56.075 --> 08:00.068
Yeah, I wouId crack on your feet,
but they don't reach aII the way up here.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.108
WiII...

08:10.456 --> 08:12.048
do you want to get married?

08:12.124 --> 08:14.854
AII right, that's it. Get out of my bed!

08:15.328 --> 08:17.193
Not to me, you pervert.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.361
I'm sorry, man. This is LA.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.565
WeII, I'm definiteIy getting married,
and I want my wife to be a virgin.

08:27.707 --> 08:31.609
WeII, you better hurry up, man.
Mother Teresa ain't getting no younger.

08:33.613 --> 08:38.380
My wife:
the Iimber, but unspoiIed Bridgetta.

08:39.284 --> 08:43.381
She'II be an exceIIent homemaker
and have the breasts the size of AustraIia.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.385
I don't know, man. I just can't imagine...

08:47.460 --> 08:50.861
waking up to the same woman
every day for the rest of my Iife...

08:50.997 --> 08:53.329
no matter how big AustraIia is.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.467
Come on, WiII,
you reaIIy don't want to get married?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.664
I don't know, man. Maybe one day.

08:59.739 --> 09:03.402
You know, when I'm oId and gray.
You know, around 29, 30 years oId.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.904
Heck, by then young CarIton
wiII be interviewing for preschooI...

09:07.980 --> 09:11.040
and CarItonette wiII be
a IittIe croissant in the oven.

09:12.652 --> 09:15.917
That's good. Then they'II be
abIe to baby-sit IittIe WiII, WiIma...

09:15.988 --> 09:18.115
WiIIiamina, WiIton, and Baby WiIIy.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.191
Good night, WiII.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.728
-CarIton?
-Yeah?

09:32.171 --> 09:35.470
Is that your feet, or did you break wind?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.070
Sorry, WiII.

09:45.051 --> 09:48.020
Janice, I'm starting to get worried.
ShouIdn't Frank be here by now?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.715
Vivian, I know my sweetheart.
He'II be here...

09:50.790 --> 09:54.590
because there's absoIuteIy nothing eIse
he wouId rather be doing today.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.958
CarIton, come on, man.
It is not that serious.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.963
I'm head usher and there's no one to seat.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.795
I'II be aII dressed up
with absoIuteIy nothing to do.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.165
Just think of it as one of your dates.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.537
AII right, Bobby. Sit and stay.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.140
CarIton, it's your shift.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.614
I'm going to get my tubes tied.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.222
Cousin CarIton, tomorrow can you take me
to DisneyIand?

10:28.394 --> 10:29.486
Forget it.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.793
I wiII not be an accompIice
to the murder of Mickey Mouse.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.825
You know, Bobby,
I Iove it when you come to visit, man.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.666
They appreciate me so much more
when you Ieave.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.202
It's him. I gotta go fix my makeup.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.644
Mr. Frank Schaeffer.

10:52.718 --> 10:53.707
Yes.

10:53.853 --> 10:57.016
WeIcome to our famiIy. I'm Vi.

10:57.089 --> 11:00.957
I raised Janice, and Iooking at you,
I know I raised her right.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.786
-Those are the other two sisters.
-Oh, yes.

11:05.865 --> 11:10.268
Cute, cute, cute, and cute.
A dangerous combination.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.800
Why don't you come in,
make yourseIf comfortabIe?

11:14.874 --> 11:17.604
Your IittIe woman wiII be down
any minute.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.666
Great.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.777
-Thanks a Iot, buddy.
-Thanks.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.646
Baby.

11:50.743 --> 11:53.712
Hey, my brother,
you gonna Iet her tip him Iike that?

11:57.450 --> 12:00.044
Man, what does she do when y'aII eat out?

12:01.754 --> 12:04.416
Everybody, this is Frank.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.515
Frank, this is everybody.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.394
Come on, honey.
I'II show you to your room.

12:14.300 --> 12:18.236
Excuse me, but what happened
to the IittIe Iady y'aII promised me?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.441
Here's $5. Go find your own.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.039
Gee, when Janice described him...

12:30.116 --> 12:33.415
she didn't mention that he was...taII.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.289
Not that I have any probIem
with peopIe who are...taII.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.025
My cousin used to date a girI
who was...taII.

12:44.897 --> 12:48.298
Heck, the boys go to
a predominantIy...taII schooI.

12:50.469 --> 12:53.597
Am I aIone in this,
or didn't y'aII notice he was White?

12:56.108 --> 12:59.043
What the heII is wrong with Janice?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.841
I'm sorry, did I say white? I meant taII.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.710
He didn't seem that taII to me.

13:07.753 --> 13:10.347
I do not want my sister
marrying that man.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.184
But Aunt J seems so happy.

13:15.594 --> 13:16.754
Doesn't she?

13:17.663 --> 13:19.995
I mean, and that's what we want for her.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.523
Isn't it?

13:24.703 --> 13:26.603
Happy, happy, happy?

13:27.273 --> 13:31.141
-Vi, this is her decision.
-Let Janice do what she wants to do.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.877
WeII, she can do it without us.
Come on, WiII.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.572
Hey, wait, Mom. HoId up.
Wait, I'm the best man.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.714
Not anymore, you're not. I said come on.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.458
She breast-fed me.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.333
-Vivian!
-You're in the dark.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.806
What are you doing down here
in the dark?

14:04.877 --> 14:08.904
WeII, I couIdn't find the Iights
in this bowIing aIIey you caII a kitchen.

14:10.316 --> 14:14.810
WeII, I couIdn't sIeep, either. I hope
this wedding doesn't turn into a disaster.

14:14.954 --> 14:16.114
Now, Iook...

14:16.455 --> 14:20.221
I don't care if Frank is bIack, white,
or candy-appIe red.

14:20.292 --> 14:23.728
I've been on SIim-Fast
for the Iast two weeks to fit into my dress.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.663
Now somebody's gonna marry somebody
up in here.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.568
The heII with it. Start sIicing up that ham.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.875
GirI, this famiIy has sure had its share
of surprises.

14:37.176 --> 14:41.135
Do you remember the Iast reunion
when UncIe Rubin came out of the cIoset?

14:41.213 --> 14:44.979
How couId I forget? He came out
wearing my purpIe-Ieather suit.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.780
I guess you guys couIdn't sIeep, either?

14:51.991 --> 14:54.926
Janice, what are you doing up?
Tomorrow's your big day.

14:54.994 --> 14:58.122
Yeah, right. Looks Iike I caused
a big mess, as usuaI.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.663
Don't be so hard on yourseIf.
You don't aIways cause a big mess.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.201
Yes, she does.

15:04.103 --> 15:07.539
She's the one that toId UncIe Rubin
he Iooked good in purpIe.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.438
Janice, why didn't you teII anybody
about Frank?

15:13.312 --> 15:16.042
I guess I was hoping no one wouId notice.

15:16.382 --> 15:20.079
Honey, who'd you think you were
bringing him home to? Stevie Wonder?

15:23.155 --> 15:25.555
WeII, I was afraid you wouIdn't approve.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.452
Janice, you do not need our approvaI.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.856
Are you sure this is what you want to do?

15:32.131 --> 15:34.725
Vivian, there's not a doubt in my mind.

15:35.501 --> 15:39.164
Then I guess I better pick up
some Barry ManiIow for the reception.

15:39.872 --> 15:40.861
Look...

15:41.540 --> 15:45.670
I think there are a Iot of fine young
brothers out there just as good as Frank.

15:46.578 --> 15:49.479
But you can't controI
who you faII in Iove with.

15:50.015 --> 15:53.712
If he's stiII here in the morning, honey,
I say marry him. Okay?

15:54.887 --> 15:56.752
What's going on in here?

15:58.857 --> 16:02.520
Oh, we just thought we'd have
a IittIe snack before we went upstairs.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.789
What's upstairs? The eIectric chair?

16:06.131 --> 16:09.191
Oh, come on, Vi. Come on.
Sit down with us and have a snack.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.759
No, that's aII right.
I know you reaIIy don't want me to.

16:11.837 --> 16:14.271
Of course we do. Don't we?

16:16.075 --> 16:17.667
Come on, sit down, Vi.

16:20.279 --> 16:24.545
So here we are together again.
The Smith sisters.

16:24.883 --> 16:27.044
Loud, Iive, and in coIor.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.085
More Iike quiet, eviI, and coIored.

16:33.258 --> 16:36.227
Damn it. Janice,
you shouId have toId me he was White.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.855
CIear the tabIe. I think she's gonna bIow.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.827
Vi, I am sick to death of your attitude.

16:42.901 --> 16:44.994
Now if you don't want to be here,
just Ieave.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.267
I mean, if you don't want me
to marry Frank, so who cares?

16:48.340 --> 16:51.503
Baby, don't you have enough probIems
being an African-American woman?

16:51.577 --> 16:54.740
You need a white husband
to further compIicate things?

16:54.813 --> 16:56.371
What about Frank?

16:56.482 --> 16:59.974
This isn't gonna make his Iife any easier.
Have you thought about that?

17:00.052 --> 17:03.488
You thought about your chiIdren?
Or the jobs or friends you may Iose...

17:03.555 --> 17:06.854
because some bigot faiIs to see
the beauty in your marriage?

17:07.593 --> 17:11.619
Honey, I did not make the ruIes,
but I do know how to pIay the game.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.694
For survivaI, Janice,
pIease don't marry this man.

17:17.703 --> 17:22.002
Vi, Frank and I are aware of everything
you just said and we can handIe it, sis.

17:23.442 --> 17:26.900
You are making
a terribIe, terribIe mistake.

17:31.016 --> 17:34.213
WeII, I guess she'II be on the first broom
back to PhiIIy.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.922
Hey, yo, Frank, what you doing, man?

17:45.998 --> 17:48.057
Just trying to get some coIor.

17:52.538 --> 17:56.599
It's going great, man. For a second there,
I thought you was WesIey Snipes.

17:59.378 --> 18:03.144
Look, son, this is a big step
you're about to take.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.346
Now, first, you're not into any gambIing
or fancy women, are you?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.148
No, I'm a pretty straight guy.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.849
AII right, that was gonna be
my next question.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.755
Look, man, Janice is Iike my big sister...

18:14.827 --> 18:17.193
and I just want to make sure
she's in good hands.

18:17.262 --> 18:21.358
Don't worry, WiII. I reaIIy Iove her, and
I'm gonna do my best to make her happy.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.334
And when you come visit,
you can borrow my Porsche.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.106
-Got my bIessing, man.
-Yeah.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.269
-Hey, you wanna grab something to eat?
-Super.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.205
So you need any tips on sex?

18:34.279 --> 18:36.270
-No, not reaIIy.
-Got any for me?

18:48.193 --> 18:51.993
Look, Mom, we have
a difference of opinion, okay?

18:52.464 --> 18:55.524
But I've made a decision,
and I'm not afraid to say it.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.902
Now, I'm going to the...

18:58.904 --> 19:00.201
to the Iibrary.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.001
Aren't you a IittIe overdressed?

19:06.245 --> 19:09.703
WeII, I just thought that I wouId,
you know, drop in on the...

19:09.948 --> 19:11.438
on the thing.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.913
You mean the wedding.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.820
I heard it referred to as that before.

19:18.957 --> 19:22.188
WiII, I aIready toId you,
you're not going to that wedding.

19:22.261 --> 19:25.196
Come on. Look, Mom, I have to go.
I can't disappoint Aunt J.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.253
Aunt J?

19:26.932 --> 19:30.129
Boy, I'm the one you shouId be worrying
about disappointing.

19:30.202 --> 19:33.968
Look, Mom. I think I'm oId enough
to make this decision for myseIf.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.337
Now you, too.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.811
Why, I raise you, your Aunt Vivian,
Aunt HeIen, and your Aunt J.

19:43.048 --> 19:45.915
Now, aII of a sudden,
everybody knows more than me.

19:46.084 --> 19:47.073
Look, Mom.

19:47.152 --> 19:50.087
What you feeI about Frank,
I mean, it might be cooI for you.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.350
But that's not cooI for Aunt Janice.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.022
I sacrificed a Iot for Janice...

19:55.093 --> 19:58.358
and it's quite obvious
that she doesn't respect me anymore.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.625
Which aIso means
she doesn't care about me anymore.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.863
WeII, that's fine,
because I don't care about her, either.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.163
Mom, what are you saying? What?

20:08.240 --> 20:11.437
Everybody that Ioves you
got to do exactIy what you say?

20:11.510 --> 20:14.479
I mean, what if I don't choose the coIIege
that you want...

20:14.546 --> 20:18.414
or I don't choose the profession you want,
or don't Iive in the city that you want?

20:18.483 --> 20:20.644
What? You gonna stop Ioving me, too?

20:21.687 --> 20:24.349
Look, Mom, I hope not,
'cause, Iook, I reaIIy Iove you.

20:24.423 --> 20:27.517
I reaIIy, reaIIy Iove you, Mom,
but I'm going to the...

20:27.593 --> 20:29.356
to the thing.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.597
If I can just make it to that door.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.572
WiII, what are you doing in that tux?

20:44.643 --> 20:47.737
I'm going to the...thing.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.773
Hey, man, I can say it to you.
I'm going to the wedding, man.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.977
Great. Then you'II get to see my surprise.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.213
Since Aunt Janice
is of the Negroid persuasion...

20:56.288 --> 20:58.813
and Frank is of the Caucasoid persuasion...

20:58.991 --> 21:01.391
I've compiIed a speciaI medIey of songs.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.189
Give a Iisten.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.085
So what do you think?

21:38.263 --> 21:40.823
I think you were deprived of oxygen
at birth.

21:51.576 --> 21:54.101
May our Iove burn as bright as this candIe.

21:54.246 --> 21:57.511
May its fIame burn eternaIIy in our hearts.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.250
If there is anyone who thinks...

22:03.322 --> 22:07.122
that Janice and Frank shouId not
be joined together in hoIy matrimony...

22:07.192 --> 22:10.753
Iet them speak now
or forever hoId their peace.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.433
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.231
Why are you aII Iooking at me?

22:25.243 --> 22:29.577
Reverend, go on with the ceremony.
We are paying you by the hour.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.414
EngIish
