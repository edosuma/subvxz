WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.137
-Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer--
-Spike!

00:03.170 --> 00:04.538
Why didn't your chip go off?

00:04.572 --> 00:06.573
-We were at the Initiative.
-There was a choice.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.877
Right. To either repair
the chip, or to remove it.

00:09.910 --> 00:13.846
-You removed the chip?
-Yeah. Spike has a soul now.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.882
That's what's gonna stop him
from hurting people.

00:15.916 --> 00:19.753
-Buffy--
-He can be a good man, Giles.
I feel it.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.257
How do you know about Slayers?

00:23.291 --> 00:26.025
My mother was one.
She was killed when I was four.

00:26.059 --> 00:29.263
-Something got her? A demon?
- A vampire.

00:29.297 --> 00:32.566
-So, how do you two
know each other?
-He works with me.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.034
Uh, you know,
 in the struggle against evil.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.905
He's a vampire.
Nice coat. Where'd you get it?

00:37.938 --> 00:39.240
New York.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.945
(thunder rumbling)

00:54.954 --> 00:57.557
Well, all right!
Got the moves, don't ya?

00:57.591 --> 01:00.527
I'm gonna ride you hard
before I put you away, luv.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.695
You sure about that?

01:02.729 --> 01:05.299
You actually look
a little wet
and limp to me.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.501
And I ain't your "luv."
(grunts)

01:08.468 --> 01:10.337
(groaning)

01:15.308 --> 01:16.676
-(groans)
-(grunts)

01:19.579 --> 01:21.748
(grunting, groaning continues)

01:33.360 --> 01:35.528
(roars)

01:45.706 --> 01:48.609
I spent a long time
tryin' to track you down.

01:48.641 --> 01:52.912
You don't really want
the dance to end so
soon, do you, Nikki?

01:52.945 --> 01:54.747
The music's
just startin', isn't it?

01:54.781 --> 01:56.884
(thunder continues)

01:59.552 --> 02:01.454
By the way,

02:04.123 --> 02:05.793
Love the coat.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.295
Mama?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.935
You did a good job,
baby boy.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.137
You stayed down,
just like Mama told you.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.039
Can we go home now?
Uh-uh.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.141
It's not safe there anymore.

02:22.175 --> 02:25.012
How about I leave you over
at Crowley's house?

02:25.045 --> 02:27.480
And you can play
with those spooky doodads
that you like.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.081
No, I want to stay
with you.

02:31.884 --> 02:34.021
Yeah, I know you do, baby.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.490
But remember, Robin, honey,
what we talked about.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.325
Always gotta work
the mission.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.061
Look at me.

02:42.362 --> 02:44.465
You know I love you.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.033
But I got a job to do.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.103
The mission is
what matters, right?

02:51.838 --> 02:54.775
That's my boy.
Come on.

03:04.116 --> 03:06.019
Robin?

03:07.420 --> 03:09.021
(grunting)

03:14.427 --> 03:16.796
(groaning)

03:25.138 --> 03:27.275
(shouts)

03:36.317 --> 03:38.218
Spike!

03:46.158 --> 03:48.896
(growling)

03:48.929 --> 03:51.965
(shouts)

03:51.998 --> 03:53.966
A little tip, mate.

03:56.670 --> 04:00.640
The stake's your friend.
Don't be afraid to use it.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.311
What?

04:12.819 --> 04:14.687
Just waiting
for my moment.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.264
(theme music playing)

05:14.081 --> 05:16.048
(bell ringing)

05:16.082 --> 05:18.851
(chattering)

05:22.689 --> 05:25.225
Situation still normal.

05:25.257 --> 05:27.595
Well, or as normal as this
school ever sees.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.031
So it appears.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.334
Well, no fires.
No one's head's going kablooey.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.569
And the swing choir
and the marching band
have gone back

05:36.603 --> 05:39.540
to their normal, healthy,
seething resentment.

05:39.572 --> 05:43.076
Yeah, it's been pretty quiet
around here since you
shut down that Seal.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.177
You just may have stopped
this thing, Buffy.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.014
No, i-it can't be that easy.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.382
You call that easy?

05:49.417 --> 05:51.418
Hey, any apocalypse
i avert without dying?

05:51.451 --> 05:54.822
Yeah, those are the easy ones.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.725
You know, you're, uh,
you're something else,
Miss Summers.

05:57.757 --> 06:02.862
I've been watching you
when we're out patrolling,
and you're, um--

06:02.896 --> 06:04.732
You remind me of my, um--

06:06.199 --> 06:09.101
Your mother?
Yeah.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.605
Yeah, what I remember
of her anyway.

06:11.639 --> 06:14.841
I gotta tell you,
not a line every girl
likes to hear,

06:14.875 --> 06:17.911
but in this case,
compliment taken.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.680
Maybe you're right.
Maybe everything is fine.

06:20.713 --> 06:24.016
Everything's terrible!
Total catastrophe!

06:24.050 --> 06:25.685
Giles, what's wrong?

06:25.718 --> 06:28.622
Have you seen the new library?
Th-th-there's nothing
but computers.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.858
There's not a book to be seen.
I-- I don't know where
to begin, Buffy.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.793
I-- I mean, who do--
who do we speak to?

06:33.826 --> 06:37.697
Uh, th-that would be me.
Hi. I'm Robin Wood.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.933
Oh, uh, sorry.
Yes, uh, Rupert Giles. Sorry.

06:40.968 --> 06:45.204
Uh, B-Buffy tells me
that you're something
of a freelance demon fighter.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.307
Listen. Excuse me.
Oh, yes.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.978
Um, I, um-- I'm relieved. I--

06:51.011 --> 06:54.481
We're running dangerously low
on allies.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.884
So, we didn't
stop it then?

06:56.917 --> 07:00.086
Um, no, the, uh,
Seers of the coven

07:00.120 --> 07:03.456
are certain the First
is continuing
to gather its forces.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.959
I'm afraid war
is inevitable.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.600
-So, we should go
before the school board.
-What?

07:12.632 --> 07:15.968
Well, I-- I can have
my backup library sent
from home in the meantime.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.605
-You know, it's not much, but--
-Giles.

07:18.639 --> 07:22.141
Knowledge comes from crafted
bindings and pages, Buffy,

07:22.175 --> 07:24.644
not ones and zeros.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.680
So, did you bring back
any Potentials?

07:26.713 --> 07:31.184
Um, no, actually, my--
my, uh, my trip
was about something else.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.254
It's, um, regarding Spike.
Spike. What about him?

07:34.286 --> 07:36.423
I told you my concerns

07:36.456 --> 07:39.158
when you recklessly chose
to remove the chip
from his head.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.362
-Wait, sorry. Chip?
-Uh, it's a long story.

07:42.394 --> 07:45.365
The military put a chip
in Spike's head,
so he couldn't hurt anyone.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.966
And that would be
the abridged version.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.103
But he wouldn't
hurt anyone anymore
because he has a soul now.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.673
-Unless the First
triggers him again.
-Triggers the chip?

07:52.706 --> 07:55.207
No, the trigger's
a posthypnotic thing.
The First put it in his head.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.511
It was--

07:57.545 --> 08:00.312
Made him--
He was killing again.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.615
So, he has a trigger,
a soul and a chip?

08:02.649 --> 08:05.384
Not anymore.
It was killing him, Giles!

08:05.418 --> 08:07.987
-The trigger?
-No, the chip. The trigger's
not active anymore.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.923
Because the military
gave him a soul?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.293
Sorry.

08:14.326 --> 08:18.999
We don't know
that the trigger is inactive.

08:19.031 --> 08:23.502
What I brought back
may help us to disarm it--

08:23.536 --> 08:26.338
Ascertain exactly what it is
that causes Spike's behavior.

08:26.372 --> 08:30.143
It was that song, Giles.
I-I'm telling you. It was that
song that Spike was singing.

08:30.177 --> 08:34.014
But he has no memory of it.
Is there any part of it
that you can remember?

08:34.047 --> 08:36.082
It wasn't like it had
a catchy hook
or anything,

08:36.115 --> 08:39.186
you know, like,
"I'm comin' up, so you better
get this party started."

08:39.219 --> 08:41.187
Uh, boring, old and English.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.224
Hmm. Just like
you-- ull Brynner.

08:45.424 --> 08:47.394
Yul Brynner.

08:49.361 --> 08:51.698
But a--
a British Yul Brynner.

08:51.731 --> 08:55.434
This thing you brought
to keep Spike
from killing again--

08:55.467 --> 08:57.571
How's it work?

08:57.605 --> 09:00.373
It will require
a bit of magic.

09:00.407 --> 09:03.210
Well, we couldn't have
put these chains
back up a week ago.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.046
No. We gotta work
on Spike now, of all times.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.280
What?

09:08.315 --> 09:11.118
(chuckles)
Nothin'.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.791
What are you doin' here?
You came to see the show?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.592
I thought you might
need support.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.763
Uh-huh. (sighs) right.
Let's get this over with.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.932
What are you gonna do?
Some hypno-beam,
a disarming spell?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.034
Not exactly.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.403
The First has
brainwashed you.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.773
There's something
in your subconscious
that it's using

09:32.806 --> 09:35.307
to provoke
a violent reaction.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.610
So...

09:38.311 --> 09:40.880
we have to put this
in your brain.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.282
Bugger that.

09:42.315 --> 09:46.253
The prokaryote stone
will move within your mind

09:46.286 --> 09:49.489
to reveal the root
of the trigger's power.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.659
It can unleash ideas,
images, memories.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.895
Hopefully, once you understand
what it is

09:55.928 --> 09:59.966
that's setting you off,
you can break its hold on you.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.135
"Hopefully"?
So, it might not work?

10:03.169 --> 10:07.006
W-well, the stone's just
a catalyst for the process.
The rest is up to Spike.

10:07.039 --> 10:10.076
And how do you expect
to get that hunk of rubble
into my cranium?

10:10.110 --> 10:13.080
-Willow?
-Okay.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.514
Just hope
my pronunciation
is in the ballpark.

10:17.049 --> 10:20.953
(sighs)
(speaks foreign language)

10:20.988 --> 10:23.657
(continues speaking
foreign language)

10:27.059 --> 10:29.495
(Cecses speaking
foreign language)

10:34.366 --> 10:36.803
Oh, you have
got to be joking.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.706
What now?
It shall access
the cerebral cortex

10:39.740 --> 10:41.674
via the optic nerve.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.376
Oh, bollocks!

10:44.411 --> 10:46.980
With all the rubbish
people keep stickin'
in my head,

10:47.014 --> 10:49.381
it's a wonder
there's any room
for my brain.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.784
I don't think it takes up
that much space, do you?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.687
(sighs)

11:03.996 --> 11:06.133
Ow! Ow, ow!

11:06.166 --> 11:07.466
Spike!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.903
(groans)

11:09.937 --> 11:12.272
Spike, listen to me.
Yeah.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.841
Are you all right?

11:13.874 --> 11:16.109
How am I supposed to know
if this bug ugly's doin' his j--

11:19.611 --> 11:23.850
SPIKE'S VOICE:
"Yet her smell, it doth linger,
painting pictures in my mind.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.721
"Her eyes, bowls of honey.

11:27.754 --> 11:30.758
"Angels' harps her laugh.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.394
"Oh, lark, grant a sign...

11:34.427 --> 11:37.764
"If crooked be cupid's shaft.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.667
"Hark, the lark?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.403
"Her name it hath spake.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.538
"'Cecily,' it discharges...

11:46.572 --> 11:48.775
From twixt its wee beak."

11:52.278 --> 11:55.783
-Tsk. Oh, William.
-It's just scribbling.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.918
Nonsense.
It's magnificent.

11:58.951 --> 12:02.956
I wonder, though.
This Cecily of whom
you write so often--

12:02.990 --> 12:05.091
Oh--
(sighs)

12:05.125 --> 12:08.028
Would that be
the Underwoods' eldest girl?

12:08.061 --> 12:11.563
Uh, no. No.
Uh, I do not presume.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.966
-She's lovely.
-(exhales)

12:14.000 --> 12:16.469
You shouldn't be alone.
You need a woman in your life.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.405
I have a woman
in my life.

12:19.438 --> 12:21.875
But you ne--

12:21.908 --> 12:25.077
(Sighs, chuckles)

12:25.111 --> 12:27.914
(chuckling)
oh.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.582
Well, do not mistake me.

12:30.616 --> 12:34.922
I still have hopes
that one day there will be
an addition to this household.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.091
But I will always
look after you, Mother.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.860
This I promise.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.532
(gasps, coughs)

12:58.711 --> 13:00.980
Should I send the coach
for Dr. Gull?

13:02.149 --> 13:04.116
No. (sighs)

13:04.150 --> 13:05.384
I'll be all right.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.822
(exhales)

13:08.855 --> 13:11.658
Oh, it's passed.
(sighs)

13:11.691 --> 13:13.994
Just sit with me a while,
will you?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.828
Of course.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.542
* Early one morning

13:29.576 --> 13:32.711
* Just as the sun was shining

13:32.745 --> 13:36.482
* I heard a maid sing

13:36.515 --> 13:40.120
* In the valley below

13:40.153 --> 13:43.389
* "Oh, don't deceive me

13:43.423 --> 13:46.493
* "Oh, never leave me

13:46.525 --> 13:49.229
* "How could you use a

13:49.261 --> 13:51.230
* Poor maiden so" *

13:54.868 --> 13:56.602
(growling)
(gasps)

13:58.504 --> 14:01.441
(growling continues)

14:03.842 --> 14:05.677
(screams)

14:05.711 --> 14:08.215
-Dawn!
-(growls)

14:11.750 --> 14:13.620
(shouts)

14:41.480 --> 14:43.216
Get these soddin' things
off me. I'm fine.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.352
Don't you think you should
take a little time,
calm down?

14:46.385 --> 14:47.720
I am calm.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.424
This stone of yours is--
is out, right?
It did its job?

14:52.459 --> 14:53.860
So, I'm detriggered, right?

14:53.893 --> 14:57.463
Spike, what do you remember
about the song?

14:57.496 --> 15:00.200
(sighs)
oh, yeah, the song.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.370
It's called
"Early One Morning."
Old folk ditty.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.072
-What's it mean to you?
-Mean?

15:06.105 --> 15:09.576
Nothing.
It's just, uh, my mum.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.245
It was her favorite.
She used to sing it to me...

15:12.278 --> 15:14.280
when I was a baby.

15:16.182 --> 15:20.320
-And?
-No "and." That's it.

15:20.352 --> 15:24.291
Look, shouldn't you
check on Dawnie? I clocked
the niblet pretty fierce.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.759
She'll be okay.
She's tough.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.062
O-ow!
I'm sorry.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.264
(phone ringing)
WILLOW: Doesn't look like
anything's broken.

15:32.298 --> 15:33.500
Did you use some sort
of a magic x-ray?

15:33.533 --> 15:36.336
No, that's just
what people usually say.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.105
Oh.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.006
So Spike's trigger's
been active
this entire time.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.109
How can Buffy
take this for granted?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.576
I mean, he--
he lives in our house.
We train with him.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.613
Don't waste your time
down that road.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.847
Spike's got some sort of
"Get Out of Jail Free" card

15:48.880 --> 15:50.482
that doesn't apply
to the rest of us.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.884
I mean, he could slaughter
a hundred frat boys and--

15:56.155 --> 16:00.259
Forgiveness makes us human.
(chuckles) Blah-di, blah,
blah, blah.

16:00.293 --> 16:04.197
Uh, Willow, a call for you
from L.A. Somebody named Fred.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.365
The guy sounds
kind of effeminate.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.302
Look, Spike, listen to me.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.339
What-- wh-what is it
about your mother?

16:12.371 --> 16:15.341
I don't know.
I got along fine with her.
She was a nice lady.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.211
-Well,
there has to be more than that.
-Well, there bloody well isn't!

16:20.547 --> 16:22.815
What are you doing?
I'm going
to unchain him.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.485
Buffy, just--
This is pointless, Giles.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.489
Okay, he doesn't know anything.
Your prophylactic stone
didn't work.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.292
Because he's not cooperating.
This process takes time.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.561
He's blocking whatever's
flooding his consciousness,

16:34.594 --> 16:37.330
And what he does--
he's endangered us all.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.466
So the trigger's
still working?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.368
Much as ever.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.837
(sighs)

16:53.879 --> 16:57.250
Ooh, such a pretty house
you have, sweet Willie.

16:58.784 --> 17:02.188
It smells of daffodils,
and viscera.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.092
Don't get too attached now.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.997
We won't be here
for long, luv.

17:11.029 --> 17:13.098
Well, then,

17:13.133 --> 17:15.733
Shall we give it
a proper good-bye?
(growls)

17:16.769 --> 17:18.805
You're a saucy one,
aren't you?

17:26.113 --> 17:28.748
(moaning)

17:28.780 --> 17:30.817
(chuckling)

17:36.256 --> 17:40.593
Dru, we'll bring this world
to its knees.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.262
It's ripe and ready,
my darling,

17:43.296 --> 17:45.365
waiting for us
to devour its fruit.

17:45.397 --> 17:49.135
We'll ravage
the city together, my pet,

17:49.169 --> 17:51.938
lay waste to all of Europe.

17:51.971 --> 17:55.375
The three of us
will teach those snobs
and elitists

17:55.407 --> 17:56.942
with their folderol
just what--

17:56.976 --> 17:59.445
Three?
You, me and Mother.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.981
We'll open up their veins
and bathe in their blood...

18:03.015 --> 18:06.085
As they scream
our names across--

18:06.118 --> 18:09.989
What?
You-- You want to bring
your mum with us?

18:11.124 --> 18:13.759
Well, yeah.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.827
You'll like her.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.998
(chuckles)
To eat, you mean?

18:19.030 --> 18:20.932
(footsteps approaching)

18:20.967 --> 18:22.568
William?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.104
Ah, Mother.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.140
Where have you been?

18:27.173 --> 18:30.076
I've been beside myself
for days.

18:30.108 --> 18:31.844
You needn't
have worried, Mother.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.914
You'll never have to worry
about anything again.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.185
Something has happened.

18:41.653 --> 18:45.090
-I've changed.
-I-- I don't--
Who is this woman?

18:45.124 --> 18:48.295
I'm the other
that gave birth
to your son.

18:48.327 --> 18:51.330
-I beg your pardon?
-It's true, Mother.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.868
Drusilla--

18:56.903 --> 19:01.473
She-- she has made me
what I am.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.678
I am no longer bound
to this mortal coil.

19:07.012 --> 19:09.949
I have become
a creature of the night.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.983
A vampire.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.386
Are you drunk?

19:16.655 --> 19:20.058
A little bit.
(coughing)

19:20.092 --> 19:22.628
Think of it.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.864
No more sickness.

19:24.896 --> 19:27.733
No more dying.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.568
You'll never age
another day.

19:31.203 --> 19:34.973
Let me do this for you.
What are you
talking about?

19:35.007 --> 19:38.411
And wh-why are you
acting so strangely?

19:38.444 --> 19:39.846
It's all right, Mother.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.450
It's only me.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.192
We'll be together forever.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.763
William--

19:59.798 --> 20:02.568
It only hurts...

20:02.602 --> 20:04.471
for a moment.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.411
WILLOW:
Buffy?

20:11.443 --> 20:13.680
Hey, I, uh,
just got a phone call.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.583
I'm gonna have to
take off for a while,
maybe a day or two.

20:16.615 --> 20:19.117
What's wrong?
Nothing you need
to worry about.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.253
I'll give you
the full scoop later.

20:21.288 --> 20:24.356
Maybe I'll even
bring back some good news.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.692
(Buffy sighs)
could use a little of that.

20:26.726 --> 20:31.263
Okay. Then i guess
now is as good a time as
we're likely to see for a while.

20:31.298 --> 20:34.967
Just hurry back.
Will do.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.103
Think about
what you're doing.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.105
I have.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.817
Buffy--
don't.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.624
Mr. Giles?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.493
You got a moment?

21:03.663 --> 21:07.266
-What's on your mind?
-The same thing
that's on yours.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.236
We got ourselves a problem.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.305
Spike.
Yeah.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.441
If that trigger's
still working,

21:14.473 --> 21:16.976
Then the first
must be waiting
for just the right time...

21:17.009 --> 21:19.412
to use it against us.

21:19.445 --> 21:23.482
It does seem doubtful
the first simply forgot
it had such a powerful weapon.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.652
Now, a while back,
it slipped up,

21:25.684 --> 21:29.588
told Andrew it wasn't
time yet for Spike.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.790
So, whatever the First's
ultimate plan is,

21:31.824 --> 21:34.993
it's obvious that Spike
must play an integral part
in that.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.998
Something needs to be done.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.604
Buffy would never allow it.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.673
Buffy would listen
to her Watcher,
wouldn't she?

21:46.705 --> 21:49.174
(scoffs)
Oh, yes.

21:49.208 --> 21:52.944
(chuckles) I don't think
you have much of an idea
of the Watcher-Slayer dynamic.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.846
As a matter of fact,
I was raised by a Watcher.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.784
You were?
Bernard Crowley.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.820
Took me in when I was
a young kid, trained me.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.222
Crowley?

22:04.256 --> 22:08.661
(chuckles)
I remember the name. Yeah.
New York-based Watcher.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.730
Resigned shortly after
his Slayer wa--

22:17.436 --> 22:19.605
You're Nikki Wood's son.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.375
Yes.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.778
Spike killed your mother.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.682
Yes.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.022
Does Buffy know this?

22:38.023 --> 22:41.493
She knows my mother
was a Slayer.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.195
She doesn't
know about Spike.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.900
And this has nothing to do
with personal vengeance?

22:47.933 --> 22:50.269
(scoffs)
Does it matter?

22:51.471 --> 22:55.240
He's an instrument of evil.

22:55.273 --> 22:58.277
Now, he's gonna prove to be
our undoing in this fight,
Buffy's undoing.

22:58.309 --> 23:01.513
And she will never,
never see it coming!

23:01.548 --> 23:05.384
Now, I'm talking about
what needs to be done.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.588
For the greater good, Giles.

23:11.423 --> 23:12.825
You know I'm right.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.138
What exactly
do you propose?

23:29.407 --> 23:31.743
I just need you
to keep Buffy away
for a few hours.

23:35.847 --> 23:37.916
BUFFY:
I don't know, Giles.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.251
Is this really a primo time
for a training session?

23:40.286 --> 23:42.654
I'm still
your teacher, Buffy.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.423
As adept as you are
as a Slayer,

23:45.458 --> 23:47.794
there are always
new things to learn.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.096
Now, more than ever,

23:50.128 --> 23:53.265
it's crucial
to maintain focus
on your calling.

23:53.298 --> 23:57.103
In case you haven't noticed,
our plates are
kind of full right now.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.771
Plus, I'm not
really sure how I feel
about leaving Spike

23:59.806 --> 24:02.674
at Robin's house
to watch over him.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.144
For what it's worth,
everyone at your house seemed

24:05.176 --> 24:07.078
quite relieved
at the arrangement.

24:07.113 --> 24:11.817
Um, Buffy, uh,

24:11.851 --> 24:14.520
while I'm not technically
your Watcher anymore--

24:16.955 --> 24:21.259
(sighs)
the fact that your life is
such chaos, only underscores

24:21.292 --> 24:24.262
The importance of--
of the lessons
I can impart to you.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.165
Fine. Impart away.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.201
We're on the verge
of war.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.037
It's time you looked
at the big picture.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.640
Hello? All I do is look
at the big picture.

24:33.673 --> 24:38.044
The other day,
I gave an inspirational speech
to the telephone repairman.

24:38.076 --> 24:41.447
It takes more
than rousing speeches
to lead, Buffy.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.316
If you're gonna be
a general,

24:44.349 --> 24:47.486
you need to be able
to make difficult decisions,
regardless of cost.

24:47.519 --> 24:50.189
(sighs)
Have you seen me
with those girls?

24:50.221 --> 24:54.026
I mean, the way
I-I've treated my--
my friends and my family?

24:54.059 --> 24:56.461
A-and Andrew?

24:56.494 --> 24:59.498
Believe me, I know how
to make hard decisions.

24:59.531 --> 25:01.701
Well, that's what
we're here to find out.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.605
While we work
on the basics.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.242
You live in a garage?

25:11.277 --> 25:15.748
It's just a workroom.
Kind of my, uh, sanctuary.

25:15.781 --> 25:18.116
(sighs)
A little place
to unwind, eh?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.854
A hard day's principaling
got you down,

25:21.887 --> 25:24.522
you need a place to cut loose,
let your hair down.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.659
(door creaking, closing)

25:26.692 --> 25:28.795
SPIKE:
So to speak.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.070
What the bloody hell
is this?

25:39.105 --> 25:42.374
I told you.
It's my, um, sanctuary.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.846
It's the hell mouth, Spike.
You can never be too careful.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.917
Just, um, stay away
from the walls,

25:51.951 --> 25:54.286
You'll be all right.

25:54.319 --> 25:56.387
It's a bit much,
isn't it?

25:56.422 --> 25:57.789
(beeps)

26:02.493 --> 26:05.463
What's your story, Wood?

26:07.066 --> 26:09.101
No story, really.

26:09.134 --> 26:12.971
Just tryin' to do
what's right,

26:14.773 --> 26:16.843
make a difference.
(computer beeping)

26:19.077 --> 26:22.381
How about you?
What kind of man
are you, Spike?

26:22.413 --> 26:25.317
Sorry. Not much
for self-reflection.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.654
Yeah, makes sense.

26:32.023 --> 26:35.461
See, you strike me
as the kind of guy

26:35.493 --> 26:39.131
who just
careens through life...

26:41.599 --> 26:46.772
completely oblivious
of the damage he's doing
to everyone around him.

26:46.806 --> 26:51.009
-Is that right?
-Oh, I know more about you
than you think, Spike.

26:51.042 --> 26:53.112
See, I've been
searching for you for a--

26:53.144 --> 26:54.780
a very, very long time.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.319
Ever since
you killed my mother.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.457
Killed a lot
of people's mothers.

27:05.490 --> 27:08.027
Yeah.

27:08.059 --> 27:10.696
You'd remember mine.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.001
She was a Slayer.

27:17.368 --> 27:19.204
So, that's it, isn't it?

27:20.906 --> 27:22.709
You brought me here
to kill me?

27:26.644 --> 27:30.849
No, I don't want
to kill you, S pike.

27:30.883 --> 27:34.052
I want to kill the monster
who took my mother
away from me.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.827
(beeps)
WOMAN:
* Early one morning

27:41.861 --> 27:45.663
* Just as the sun was rising

27:45.698 --> 27:50.802
* I heard a young maid sing
in the valley below *

27:50.836 --> 27:53.404
(grunting)
* "Oh, don't deceive me--

27:53.439 --> 27:55.641
(roars)

27:55.673 --> 27:57.844
* "How could you use

27:57.876 --> 28:00.578
* A poor maiden so"
There he is.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.532
Mother?

28:29.575 --> 28:31.509
Hello, William.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.679
Look at you.

28:33.711 --> 28:36.115
Mmm, yes.
All better.

28:36.147 --> 28:39.250
-You're glowing.
-Am I?

28:39.285 --> 28:40.787
Yeah.

28:40.819 --> 28:43.855
Well, I suppose
I have you to thank
for that, don't I?

28:43.890 --> 28:48.594
-However will I repay you?
-Seeing you like this
is payment enough.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.863
(chuckling)
Oh, William.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.098
You're so--

28:53.132 --> 28:55.000
(chuckles)
Tender.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.371
Well, this is
as it should be, mother.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.473
You and I together,
all of London laid out
before us.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.411
Ah, yes. "Us."

29:05.443 --> 29:09.214
First, we'll feast.
Then the night is yours.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.151
Theater perhaps?
Dancing?

29:12.183 --> 29:15.354
Tell me,
what's your pleasure?
Pleasure?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.157
To take my leave of you,
of course.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.262
"The lark has spake
from twixt its wee beak."

29:25.596 --> 29:27.665
You honestly thought
I could bear an eternity

29:27.699 --> 29:29.035
listening to
that twaddle?

29:31.502 --> 29:33.806
-(roars)
-That's right, dog! Fight back!

29:33.839 --> 29:35.807
-(growling)
-(grunting)

29:37.809 --> 29:40.011
I feel extraordinary.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.480
It's as though
I've been given new eyes.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.617
I see everything.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.686
Understand...

29:49.888 --> 29:51.156
everything.

29:52.523 --> 29:55.961
Mother--
I hate to be cruel.

29:55.994 --> 30:00.499
No, I don't.
I used to hate
to be cruel in life.

30:00.531 --> 30:02.634
Now, I I find it rather freeing.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.537
Nothing less will pry
your greedy little fingers

30:05.570 --> 30:07.806
off my apron strings,
will it?

30:07.839 --> 30:09.607
Stop, please.

30:09.641 --> 30:13.811
Ever since the day
you first slithered from me
like a parasite.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.848
(both grunting)

30:18.217 --> 30:20.318
What are you s--
Had I known better,

30:20.352 --> 30:23.422
I could've spared myself
a lifetime of tedium
and just...

30:25.924 --> 30:28.894
dashed your brains out
when I first saw you.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.998
(roaring)

30:33.531 --> 30:36.201
(flesh singeing)

30:37.669 --> 30:42.641
God! I prayed you'd
find a woman to release me.

30:42.673 --> 30:45.310
But you scarcely
showed an interest.

30:45.344 --> 30:49.548
Who could compare
to your doddering,
housebound mum?

30:49.580 --> 30:53.585
A captive audience
 for your witless prattle.

30:56.087 --> 30:59.357
Whatever I was,
that's not who I am anymore.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.894
Darling,

31:03.729 --> 31:06.365
It's who
you'll always be.

31:06.397 --> 31:10.868
A limp,
sentimental fool.

31:10.903 --> 31:12.770
-(roaring)
-(grunting)

31:16.976 --> 31:19.244
Hurts, don't it?

31:19.278 --> 31:21.480
This what it felt like...

31:22.713 --> 31:24.415
when you beat
the life out of her?

31:25.651 --> 31:27.853
Toyed with her--

31:27.885 --> 31:29.320
(shouting)
When you snapped her neck!

31:34.226 --> 31:36.295
-Don't kill him yet.
-(gasps) What?

31:36.327 --> 31:39.131
Why not?
Because I'm asking you
not to.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.233
(grunts)

31:42.268 --> 31:44.569
Would you let
this vampire live if
it meant saving the world?

31:44.603 --> 31:46.805
Sure.
(grunts)

31:46.837 --> 31:49.307
-Seems like
a nice enough guy.
-Thanks.

31:49.340 --> 31:51.477
No problem.
My name's Richard.

31:51.509 --> 31:52.743
Hi, Rich.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.282
(grunting, groaning)

31:57.316 --> 31:59.250
Giles, we had
this conversation...

31:59.285 --> 32:01.452
when I told you
that I wouldn't
sacrifice Dawn

32:01.487 --> 32:03.055
to stop Glory
from destroying the world.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.590
Ah, yes, but things
are different now,
aren't they?

32:05.624 --> 32:08.961
After what you've been through,
faced with the same choice
now...

32:11.363 --> 32:13.332
you'd let her die.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.634
If I had to.

32:15.666 --> 32:18.470
To save the world. Yes.

32:24.210 --> 32:27.278
(groaning)
Can I kill this guy yet?

32:27.313 --> 32:29.515
-No.
-(grunts)

32:29.548 --> 32:33.085
So, you really do understand
the difficult decisions
you'll have to make?

32:33.118 --> 32:36.454
That any one of us
is expendable in this war?

32:36.488 --> 32:38.789
Have you heard
my speeches?

32:38.824 --> 32:42.961
That we cannot allow any threat
that might jeopardize
our chances of winning.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.430
Yes, I get it!

32:44.462 --> 32:46.832
And yet there is Spike.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.602
(grunts)

32:50.635 --> 32:54.240
An animal like you
never cared for anyone
but yourself.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.976
No one else mattered.

33:01.012 --> 33:04.549
Just... all about the hunt.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.192
Yeah.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.237
(breathing heavily)
SPIKE'S MOTHER:
You want to run, don't you?

33:25.270 --> 33:29.174
Scamper off and cry
to your new little trollop.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.210
Do you think
you'll be able
to love her?

33:31.242 --> 33:35.381
Think you'll be able
to touch her
without feeling me? Hmm?

33:35.413 --> 33:38.916
All you've ever wanted
was to be back inside.

33:38.950 --> 33:41.552
And you finally
got your wish,
didn't you?

33:41.586 --> 33:45.490
Sank your teeth into me,
an eternal kiss.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.759
No. I only wanted
to make you well.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.229
You wanted
your hands on me.

33:50.261 --> 33:53.199
Perhaps you'd like
a chance to finish off
what you started?

33:53.231 --> 33:55.401
I loved you.
I did.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.604
Not like this.
Just like this.

33:58.636 --> 34:01.272
This is what
you've always wanted.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.509
Where's my dark
little Prince?

34:03.541 --> 34:04.809
No!

34:07.278 --> 34:10.215
Get out! Get out!

34:14.719 --> 34:16.088
(gasps)

34:18.056 --> 34:21.726
There, there, precious.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.929
It will only hurt
for a moment.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.364
I'm sorry.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.567
What?

34:28.599 --> 34:31.402
I'm sorry.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.161
Sorry?

34:55.193 --> 34:57.061
You think sorry's
gonna make everything right?

34:57.094 --> 34:58.264
I wasn't talking to you.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.735
I don't give a piss
about your mum.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.139
She was a slayer.
I was a vampire.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.543
-That's the way
the game is played.
-Game?

35:20.117 --> 35:22.920
She knew what she was
signin' up for.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.192
-Well, I didn't sign up for it!
-Well, that's the rub,
isn't it?

35:26.224 --> 35:28.527
You didn't sign up for it,
and somehow it's my fault.

35:28.559 --> 35:31.163
You took my childhood.
(grunting)

35:31.197 --> 35:32.731
You took her away!

35:36.168 --> 35:38.637
She was all I had.
She was my world!

35:38.670 --> 35:41.539
And you weren't hers.
Doesn't that piss you off?

35:41.572 --> 35:44.175
Shut up.
You didn't know her!

35:48.679 --> 35:49.880
I know Slayers.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.356
No matter how many people
they've got around them,
they fight alone.

35:58.556 --> 36:00.559
Life of The Chosen One.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.860
The rest of us be damned.

36:02.893 --> 36:04.795
Your mother was no different.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.164
No. Sh--

36:06.197 --> 36:08.099
She loved me.

36:09.934 --> 36:13.239
But not enough
to quit though, was it?

36:13.271 --> 36:15.139
Not enough to walk away.

36:15.172 --> 36:16.574
For you.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.878
(sighs)
I'll tell you a story...

36:20.911 --> 36:22.713
about a mother and son.

36:24.882 --> 36:27.585
See, like you,
I loved my mother.

36:29.119 --> 36:31.556
So much so
I turned her into a vampire.

36:33.190 --> 36:36.594
Huh?
So we could be
together forever.

36:38.063 --> 36:40.431
She said some nasty bits to me
after I did that.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.902
Been weighin' on me
for quite some time.

36:48.539 --> 36:52.244
But you helped me
figure somethin' out.

36:52.277 --> 36:56.047
You see, unlike you,
I had a mother
who loved me back.

36:57.449 --> 37:00.851
When I sired her,
I set loose a demon,

37:00.885 --> 37:03.454
and it tore into me.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.856
But it was the demon talking,

37:05.891 --> 37:07.793
not her.

37:10.262 --> 37:13.364
I realize that now.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.134
My mother loved me...

37:16.166 --> 37:18.936
with all her heart.

37:18.969 --> 37:20.806
I was her world.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.543
* Early one morning

37:25.577 --> 37:28.045
* Just as the sun was rising

37:28.079 --> 37:30.215
* I heard a young maid sing

37:30.248 --> 37:33.619
* In the valley below
That's a nice little song
you got there.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.625
Thanks, Doc.
You cured me after all.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.561
I got my own
free will now.

37:43.594 --> 37:47.632
I'm not under the First's
or anyone else's influences now.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.503
I just wanted you
to know that...

37:52.538 --> 37:54.139
before I kill you.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.442
(roars)

38:04.615 --> 38:06.050
Spike's a liability, Buffy.

38:07.217 --> 38:09.186
He refuses to see it.
So do you.

38:11.222 --> 38:14.760
Angel left here
because he realized...

38:14.793 --> 38:17.295
how harmful your relationship
with him was.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.431
Spike, on the other hand,
lacks such self-awareness.

38:20.465 --> 38:24.369
Spike is here
because I want him here.
We need him.

38:24.402 --> 38:27.639
I'm in the fight
of my life!
Really?

38:27.672 --> 38:29.840
Not you, Richard.

38:29.875 --> 38:33.878
You want Spike here,
even after what he's done
to you in the past?

38:33.911 --> 38:36.514
It's different now.
He has a soul.

38:36.547 --> 38:41.018
And the first
is exploiting that
to his advantage.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.088
Oh, my god.
(grunts)

38:44.322 --> 38:46.992
You're stalling me.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.460
You're keeping me away--
it's time to stop

38:49.494 --> 38:53.931
playing the role of general,
and to start being one.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.268
This is the way
wars are won!

39:00.572 --> 39:02.407
(sighs)

39:05.710 --> 39:07.512
(panting)
Spike.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.016
-What happened?
-(sighs)

39:18.757 --> 39:22.393
Oh, my god.
I gave him a pass.

39:22.427 --> 39:25.295
Let him live,
on account of the fact
I killed his mother.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.500
But that's all he gets.

39:28.534 --> 39:32.269
He even so much as
looks at me funny again,
I'll kill him.

39:37.742 --> 39:40.378
(sighs, sniffs)

39:45.617 --> 39:48.052
(Wood groaning)

40:03.802 --> 40:08.106
(sighs)
I lost my mom
a couple years ago.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.242
I came home,
and I found her dead
on the couch.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.947
I'm sorry.

40:18.148 --> 40:21.719
I understand
what you tried to do.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.456
But she's dead.
Because he murdered her.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.257
I'm preparing
to fight a war,

40:26.291 --> 40:28.827
and you're looking
for revenge on a man
that doesn't exist anymore.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.896
Buffy,
don't delude yourself.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.998
That man still exists.

40:34.032 --> 40:37.603
Spike is
the strongest warrior
we have.

40:37.635 --> 40:40.338
And we are gonna need him
if we're gonna come out
of this thing alive.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.275
If you try anything again,
he'll kill you.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.244
(scoffs)

40:47.277 --> 40:49.280
More importantly,

40:49.313 --> 40:50.815
I'll let him.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.454
I have a mission...

40:56.487 --> 40:58.456
to win this war.

40:58.489 --> 41:01.458
To save the world.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.795
I don't have time
for vendettas.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.635
The mission
is what matters.

41:35.092 --> 41:36.994
Buffy.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.900
I-- (sighs)

41:42.934 --> 41:44.835
I-- I understand your anger.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.706
Please believe me,
we d-- we did what we--

41:48.739 --> 41:51.376
He's alive.
Spike's alive.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.411
Wood failed.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.447
Well, that doesn't
change anything.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.853
What I told you
is still true.

42:01.887 --> 42:03.855
You need to learn--
No.

42:05.422 --> 42:08.193
I think you've taught me
everything I need to know.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.393
Grr! Arrgh!
