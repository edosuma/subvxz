I need you to sign a form
at my school

20:13.504 --> 20:15.089
or else I can't go anymore.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.090
Well, why would I do that?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.634
I wanna go to school,
Frank.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.469
Well, people in Hell
want cold beer.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.095
What's in it for me?

20:21.178 --> 20:23.055
I'll call Child Services.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.474
You're my father.
You've abandoned me.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.105
Well played, son.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.357
But I'm re‐abandoning you
right after this is done.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.026
Wait outside.
I used a different entrance.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.745
Hey, so there's this house
over on Kingscross.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.788
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.249
You know, it's a total dump,
but, uh,

20:50.332 --> 20:52.918
you know, it's probably
gonna go for nothin',

20:53.002 --> 20:53.794
and, uh, with a little
bit a work,

20:53.878 --> 20:55.463
could be nice.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.632
You thinking about buyin'
a house in the South Side

20:58.716 --> 20:59.884
even though you're
movin' to Milwaukee?

20:59.967 --> 21:02.428
No. No, no, no.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.138
I was just thinkin',
you know,

21:04.221 --> 21:07.183
could be a good investment
for somebody, though.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.268
[sniffs]
You know, fix it up,

21:09.351 --> 21:10.644

Did you ever do
anything like that?

21:13.230 --> 21:14.857
[laughs]

21:14.940 --> 21:17.568
I never have to worry about
what I would or wouldn't do.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.321
Mr. Tamietti paid
the down payment on my house,

21:20.404 --> 21:22.990

to start Born Free.

‐ [Brad] Hi, Tam.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.042
Hey.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.837
I gave notice
at the salon today.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.089
Which means I told Liza
to eat shit and die.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.383
‐ [Tami laughs]
‐ Oh, wow.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.009
Really?
Yeah?

21:42.092 --> 21:44.595
Burned that bridge!

21:44.678 --> 21:46.305
Ah...ha.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.015
Nice one.
Congrats.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.226
And I found a salon
near Nana's place

21:50.309 --> 21:51.143
where I can
rent out a chair.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.771
Wow, already?
Really‐‐wow‐‐Yeah.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.189

Oh, also,

21:57.149 --> 22:00.027
my Uncle Will works at
Briggs & Stratton in Milwaukee.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.862
Says they're always
looking for new mechanics.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.448
I mean, I could have my dad
give him a call.

22:06.617 --> 22:09.370
Uh...what's going on?

22:09.453 --> 22:10.788
What's goin' on?
Nothin'.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.289
Yeah, I'm workin'.
Why?

22:12.373 --> 22:14.083
You're being weird.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.876
Yeah, no, sorry, I just‐‐
I just remembered

22:15.960 --> 22:16.752
I gotta close the loop
on a couple things,

22:16.836 --> 22:19.338
so...

22:19.421 --> 22:20.172
What loops?

22:20.256 --> 22:23.300
Look, I just quit
my job.

22:23.384 --> 22:24.885
Oh, yeah, I know.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.220
Uh, it's all good,
all right?

22:26.303 --> 22:28.848
Everything's...
everything's fine.

nothin'.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.190
Nothin'.

It's got, uh, two beds,
one bath,

22:44.530 --> 22:48.033
and, you know, I mean, I‐‐
i‐it needs some work, but...

22:48.117 --> 22:51.036
well, it's a good house.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.374
Now, what do you
think?

22:56.500 --> 22:59.420
This place
is a shithole.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.255
Well, I‐I'm just lookin'
at options, all right?

23:01.338 --> 23:03.549
I mean, did you know
that Milwaukee

23:03.632 --> 23:06.594
gets even colder than
Chicago in the wintertime?

23:06.677 --> 23:08.721
And‐and you know that
we're gonna be the ones

23:08.804 --> 23:10.848
that have to check in
on your nana every week

23:10.931 --> 23:13.392
at the old folks' home
and anytime she needs anything.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.103
Uh‐huh.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.356
Look, I don't know‐‐
honestly, I feel kinda guilty,

23:19.440 --> 23:20.608
you know, takin' charity
from your family.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.530
[huffs]
You gotta be kidding me.

23:26.614 --> 23:30.326
It's what‐‐100 feet
from your family's house?

23:55.225 --> 23:58.187

23:58.270 --> 23:59.647
[Tommy] We could definitely
use another Subway.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.482
Or a check‐cashing place.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.025
[Veronica] We don't need
another check‐cashing place.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.402
Plus, all those things require
big start‐up costs.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.780
V, we should contact
that realtor.

24:07.863 --> 24:08.614
That place is gonna
rent out soon.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.824
You don't even have
a business plan.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.660
The business plan
is to rent out the place.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.453
[Veronica] Not until you know
what kinda business

24:14.536 --> 24:15.579
you wanna start
and how much it's gonna cost

24:15.663 --> 24:18.707
to get it up and running‐‐
inventory, labor‐‐

24:18.791 --> 24:20.542
a business plan.

24:21.627 --> 24:26.006
‐ Keg's kicked.
‐ Oh‐‐I have an idea.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.217
How 'bout a business
where you sell beer,

24:28.300 --> 24:30.886
and when the keg is empty,
you replace it.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.516
‐ I got it.
‐ [clang]

24:35.599 --> 24:38.435
I think that fulfills
my fatherly obligation.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.812

24:39.895 --> 24:41.772
You get to keep goin'
to school.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.774
See ya.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.359
Frank, wait.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.196
That new house that you're
living in is pretty sweet.

24:49.279 --> 24:52.783

I wanna live with you.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.538
Unfortunately, pal,
we just don't have the space.

on the South Side

24:59.498 --> 25:01.375

the business.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.378
Finding easy,
innovative ways

25:04.461 --> 25:06.213
to make money
without working.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.590
That's the Gallagher
family business.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.385
I built it from scratch.
I put in the hours.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.555
Turned it into the thriving
racket you see today.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.390

as Chairman Emeritus,

25:16.473 --> 25:20.144

Why does she
get to wear the dress?

26:45.437 --> 26:46.605
Is this some kind of
power move?

26:46.688 --> 26:49.650
I don't know, but if
her wearing a dress

26:49.733 --> 26:52.111
makes her feel powerful,
then good for her.

the final wave.

at the auction.

I really did,
but I had some time with it,

53:07.518 --> 53:10.145
and...I don't know.

53:10.229 --> 53:12.272
[sighs]

53:12.356 --> 53:16.151
You know, I‐I'm worried
about my sobriety.

53:16.235 --> 53:19.113
I've got a community here,
my meetings.

53:19.196 --> 53:21.865
Brad, the people in our group,
my job‐‐

53:21.949 --> 53:23.992
I mean, this place, it's...

53:25.828 --> 53:27.329
It's important to me.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.379
Milwaukee's baseball team
is called The Brewers.

53:35.462 --> 53:38.549
There's no way
I could stay sober up there.

53:38.632 --> 53:42.928
<i>♪♪♪</i>

53:43.011 --> 53:44.179
Tami.

53:52.354 --> 53:55.023
Rich people are crazy.

53:55.107 --> 53:57.234
Fuckin' nuts.

53:57.317 --> 54:00.112
They create drama
because they're bored.

54:00.195 --> 54:02.114
When you're poor, you don't
need to create drama.

54:02.197 --> 54:03.157
I know, every day's
a goddamn drama.

54:03.240 --> 54:06.326
What are‐‐
You're a garbage man now?

54:06.410 --> 54:08.495
It's more complicated
than that, Milk.

54:08.579 --> 54:10.789
I'm basically
an undercover cop.

54:10.873 --> 54:12.166
‐ [Debbie] Ha.
‐ Ha ha ha.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.500
Not a very good one.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.419
Undercover cops
don't go around

54:15.502 --> 54:17.629
telling people
they're undercover cops.

54:17.713 --> 54:19.047
Laugh all you want,
Sandy.

54:19.131 --> 54:21.633
It's a lot harder
than you think

54:21.717 --> 54:22.760
never knowing
who you can trust,

54:22.843 --> 54:25.554
whether or not they're gonna
figure out you're a rat.

54:25.637 --> 54:27.097
It's stressful.
Can I hit that?

54:27.181 --> 54:29.850
Don't you get
drug tested?

54:29.933 --> 54:31.643
I'm undercover‐‐
I have to do drugs

54:31.727 --> 54:32.895
so they know I'm one of 'em.

54:32.978 --> 54:33.771
Who, the garbage men?

54:33.854 --> 54:36.231
Forget it.

54:36.315 --> 54:38.192
I'm goin' to bed.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.988
Weird shit
rich people do‐‐go.

54:43.071 --> 54:43.614
They go camping.

54:43.697 --> 54:46.074
They vote.

54:46.158 --> 54:49.661
They volunteer to work
in soup kitchens.

54:49.745 --> 54:51.580
[inhales]
They kiss their dogs.

54:53.916 --> 54:57.544
Wash their cars,
even in the winter.

54:59.254 --> 55:00.714
You wanna fuck?

55:02.591 --> 55:04.885
Fuck, yeah.
