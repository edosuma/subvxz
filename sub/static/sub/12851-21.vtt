00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:07.041 --> 00:09.475
Has your mom made a decision
on the London job offer yet?

00:09.477 --> 00:11.777
Don't you think you'll hear
as soon as I've heard?

00:11.779 --> 00:13.278
Have you heard?

00:14.181 --> 00:16.315
How can I pretend
that this isn't happening

00:16.317 --> 00:17.316
if you keep
bringing it up?

00:17.318 --> 00:20.819
London is
3,459 miles away
from New York.

00:20.821 --> 00:24.289
What?
You're too far away now!

00:24.291 --> 00:26.025
We need to face this, Riles.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.326
This is the end
of Riley and Maya.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.494
How could you say that?

00:28.496 --> 00:30.195
How could you even think that?

00:30.197 --> 00:32.865
Riley and Maya are forever
no matter where we are.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.367
Remember our third best friend
Kerri Abelson?

00:35.369 --> 00:36.835
Oh, yeah.
What happened to her?

00:36.837 --> 00:39.304
She moved across the street.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.741
(both scream)

00:53.020 --> 00:54.520
Wow, so much emotion.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.322
Why is everybody so emotional
when nothing's happening?

01:00.661 --> 01:01.827
Because it is happening, Riley.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.028
Why are you so sure?

01:03.030 --> 01:04.229
Look at the board.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.332
Belgium 1831.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.369
The Netherlands was
a group of friendly states

01:10.371 --> 01:12.071
who thought they'd stay
together forever...

01:12.073 --> 01:13.205
Uh-oh.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.907
Belgium 1831 is us.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.277
...until Belgium
made the decision
it was time to go.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.679
Uh-oh! Smackle, do something!

01:20.681 --> 01:21.747
What do I do?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.082
-You--
-Ask important questions!

01:23.084 --> 01:24.616
He erases it if you ask
important questions!

01:24.618 --> 01:25.851
Gotcha.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.388
Why are we here?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.790
What is the meaning of love?

01:31.792 --> 01:34.726
Is there a destiny
that shapes our ends?

01:34.728 --> 01:37.329
What's the deal
with artificial intelligence?

01:38.466 --> 01:40.999
If it's artificial,
can it be intelligent?

01:42.369 --> 01:43.302
Yes.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.373
It was decided that Belgium
would no longer be part

01:48.375 --> 01:50.275
of the United Kingdom
of the Netherlands,

01:50.277 --> 01:52.444
but its own
independent country.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.645
Belgium was free.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.114
Did people visit it?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.150
-People like who?
-Belgium's friends.

01:58.152 --> 02:01.220
Did they visit it
or did they forget her
like Kerri Abelson?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.921
Oh, yeah. What ever
happened to Kerri?

02:02.923 --> 02:04.857
-She moved across--
-I don't care. She's gone.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.328
At that point,
Belgium was no longer
part of a group,

02:09.330 --> 02:11.463
but its own sovereign nation...

02:11.465 --> 02:13.732
ready to meet the world
on its own terms.

02:13.734 --> 02:14.967
What if it wasn't ready yet?

02:14.969 --> 02:16.635
What if none of us
are ready for this?

02:17.671 --> 02:19.338
I'm not ready
for this, Riley.

02:21.075 --> 02:24.343
So, Belgium 1831 was gonna
be about our own freedom
when we left this place?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.812
That was my plan.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.680
But sometimes,
things happen in life

02:28.682 --> 02:30.516
earlier than
they're supposed to.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.950
So, what do we do?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.352
We do our best.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.420
Like we've always done.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.689
We leave our good mark

02:37.691 --> 02:40.492
and we hope that
people remember us fondly.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.030
I did my best.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.466
I hope that you
remember me fondly.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.834
I'll remember you fondly.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.502
Thank you.
Who are you?

02:51.605 --> 02:53.005
Kerri Abelson.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.008
Oh no.

in my young life.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.603
Oh, Auggie.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.005
No matter what happens,
you're gonna be okay.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.174
What about the fury
of a woman ripped

04:02.176 --> 04:04.576
from the arms
of the man she loves?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.211
Ooh, the wife.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.546
How is she taking it?

04:07.548 --> 04:10.415
It's Ava. It can go
in any direction.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.519
(British accent)
'Ello, 'ello.

04:14.521 --> 04:15.821
It's me...

04:16.890 --> 04:18.023
Twiggy.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.093
How do you know
about Twiggy?

04:21.095 --> 04:23.562
I know all about
me new British mates.

04:23.564 --> 04:27.432
I know about Posh and Becks,
and all three Harrys:

04:27.434 --> 04:29.201
Styles, Potter,

04:29.203 --> 04:32.704
and me first husband,
the Prince.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.573
But it's me you love.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.941
I know, ducky,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.410
but Momma needs a crown.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.445
Ava, what are you doing?

04:40.447 --> 04:43.215
If we're all gonna reside
in merry ol' England,

04:43.217 --> 04:46.585
I thought that I should know
about me new home.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.487
-Honey...
-I'm going.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.488
Ava...

04:49.490 --> 04:51.556
I spoke to my mom
and she said I could go.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.158
-Really?
-Don't answer!

04:54.628 --> 04:57.462
I'm afraid
of the actual answer.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.800
My mom says that the decision
hasn't been made yet,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.702
but I'm afraid it has.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.674
(normal voice)
How do you make
this kind of decision?

05:08.676 --> 05:10.509
How is a decision
like this made?

05:10.511 --> 05:13.679
Is it tougher to leave
something you love

05:13.681 --> 05:16.748
or stay when you could
be missing an opportunity?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.083
Well, that depends.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.117
On what, Mr. Babineaux?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.485
What you're leaving behind.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.088
Anybody else?

05:23.090 --> 05:25.290
To be fair, I think
it's important to know

05:25.292 --> 05:26.658
what's waiting for you
wherever you're going.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.026
Right.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.430
Lucas and Zay both left
someplace that they loved.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.466
They were right
to love Texas.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.767
We had the best time there.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.436
And we've had
the best time here.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.639
So Belgium left
the United Kingdom
of the Netherlands,

05:40.641 --> 05:44.142
-then what happened?
-Everybody was happy
forever. The end.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.677
Okay.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.479
Anyone else want to try?

05:47.481 --> 05:50.349
The United Kingdom
of the Netherlands
fell completely apart.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.818
Maya, you look something up?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.152
No.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.821
I didn't have to.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.423
You don't really
have to be smart
to know what's coming.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.226
It's Farkle who's been smart.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.329
It's Farkle who's wanted
to know what Belgium 1831 was

06:04.331 --> 06:06.531
ever since it went up
on the board.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.534
It's Farkle
who's always loved us
and tried to protect us.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.579
Sorry, Smackle.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.583
Riley, I know your mother.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.586
I know she'll seek out
the advice of everyone
close to her.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.355
I know she'll listen
to what we have to say.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.691
And I know her decision
will be the right one.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.326
No matter what it is?

06:34.328 --> 06:37.662
No matter what it is,
we go with her.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.770
So, Mom will listen
to the people she cares about

06:44.772 --> 06:46.405
before she decides?

06:46.407 --> 06:48.740
She's probably doing
that right now.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.413
Hi.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.065
Mom?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.434
Yeah.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.702
Big decision,
and I wanted some advice.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.738
Who better to give us
advice than...

07:19.740 --> 07:22.374
these people who've all
loved each other forever?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.824
(whispering)
Fa-ha-fa...

07:40.093 --> 07:41.626
Fa-ha-hay...

07:43.130 --> 07:44.696
Fa-fa-fa...

07:46.400 --> 07:48.633
I'm not talking to you!

07:48.635 --> 07:50.402
And I'm not talking to you.

07:50.404 --> 07:51.670
Fine.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.971
Double fine.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.773
I taught you that!

07:54.775 --> 07:57.309
And I taught you
everything else.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.845
Then why don't I know anything?!

08:02.749 --> 08:04.583
Hey, Morgan.
Hey, Morgan.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.953
My brothers!
My sister!

08:07.955 --> 08:09.354
Yeah, you know,
we haven't all been

08:09.356 --> 08:10.789
in the same place together
for a long time.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.625
I don't think we've ever been
in the same place together.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.993
No.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.029
Okay, we're gonna
do this one at a time.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.599
-Mm.
-Okay.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.368
All right, look,
as much as I'd hate it
if you guys went anywhere,

08:23.370 --> 08:26.538
when we left Philadelphia
to come to New York,
that worked.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.673
If we didn't do that,
I never would have met Katy.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.109
If we didn't do that, I--

08:31.111 --> 08:32.777
I wouldn't be happy.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.914
We wouldn't have Maya.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.719
Oh, guys,
I'm not actually
your daughter though--

08:40.721 --> 08:42.487
I'll never forget
when we first saw you

08:42.489 --> 08:45.023
in the hospital delivery room.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.193
Wow, I'd really love
to rewrite history, but--

08:48.195 --> 08:49.628
History is history.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.730
First thing you have to know
to teach History.

08:51.732 --> 08:55.300
Matthews, as your
former English teacher,

08:55.302 --> 08:57.702
I say let 'em write
what they want to.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.905
Hey, Jon.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.140
Hey, Shawn.

09:06.847 --> 09:07.979
Hey, Shawn's wife.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.783
Boy, that makes me
happy saying that.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.185
Hey, Shawn's wife!

09:14.187 --> 09:15.353
(laughs)

09:15.355 --> 09:17.088
Hey.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.224
Thank you for everything
you've done to help make
Shawn who he is.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.892
Yeah...

09:20.894 --> 09:22.594
I'll never forget
the time I saw him

09:22.596 --> 09:24.429
in that hospital delivery room.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.664
(giggles)

09:25.666 --> 09:26.898
Okay, crazy people.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.067
You can't just make life
how you want it.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.902
Yeah. Things happen.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.405
Like our decision that you guys
are going to help us with.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.773
Us now!

09:34.775 --> 09:37.442
She's right. This has--
this has nothing to do with us.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.911
Just gonna...
leave that here.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.246
What-- Hey!

09:42.683 --> 09:44.115
You want to adopt me?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.451
-Yay!
-I don't know
how I feel about this.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.953
Both:
Yay!

09:48.922 --> 09:51.923
You know, Maya,
I talked with Shawn
and your mom about this.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.026
I always regretted
that I never adopted Shawn.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.763
Well, you know, my parents
tried to adopt Shawn,

09:58.765 --> 10:01.499
but he preferred
to stay a street urchin.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.636
I know this is
a difficult decision to make.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.739
I'll tell you what's
a difficult decision: ours.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.874
Yeah, can you hold
your little Topanga horses?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.444
Take all the time you need.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.548
I'm Maya Hunter.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.186
(both chuckle)

10:26.927 --> 10:28.259
Da-- Dad-- Daddy...

10:28.261 --> 10:31.029
Dad... Daddy... Dad...

10:32.265 --> 10:34.666
-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.134
I'm sorry.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.236
-For what?
-For everything
I'm gonna do.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.804
Oh, and I'm going
to London with them.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.141
Let her!
You won't miss her,
you just got her!

10:44.645 --> 10:46.111
We can only give you
our parents' advice.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.013
We raised you
to be good people

10:48.015 --> 10:50.415
and we know that you will
make your best decision.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.017
But then you leave.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.519
You leave for college,
you leave for New York,

10:54.521 --> 10:57.188
and now you're gonna fly
across the ocean

10:57.190 --> 10:59.290
and take away
my grandchildren.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.526
Me too, me too.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.431
Tell them not to
take us away, Aunt Morgan.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.101
I know what it's like to be
the youngest one in the family.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.770
You think nobody
is listening to you

11:11.772 --> 11:13.338
or your ideas,
but they are.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.006
You're very important,

11:15.008 --> 11:17.876
and they'll take
everything you say
into consideration.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.712
How can I be sure
that everything is
gonna be okay?

11:20.714 --> 11:22.814
Because life knows
that in order to be

11:22.816 --> 11:24.816
the best person
you can be,

11:24.818 --> 11:26.551
sometimes it's good to stay,

11:26.553 --> 11:29.721
sometimes you gotta go.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.562
I was once the youngest,
just like you.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.030
Is there gonna be
another me?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.866
Too late. Just you.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.902
Good.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.905
Just know that
your parents are gonna make
the right decision for you.

11:46.907 --> 11:47.972
They always do.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.742
Trust them.
They'll listen to you.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.711
Being the youngest
is really important.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.079
You're the one
they hold on to.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.615
Or not.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.887
You don't need me for this.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.556
Of course we do.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.592
You've always given us
our best advice.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.227
What do you got
for us now?

12:11.098 --> 12:12.897
London...

12:12.899 --> 12:15.500
the city of Shakespeare
and Dickens.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.238
I think you'll flourish there
just as you flourished here.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.940
You're telling us to go.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.242
I told you to go
to Yale, too.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.044
Why didn't you?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.679
I got a better offer.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.447
And now you have another.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.685
And I'm sure
you'll choose wisely,

12:33.687 --> 12:36.921
because you were
always the best test-taker.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.959
What about me?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.428
Don't listen to him.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.104
I just got hit
by the subway!

12:54.274 --> 12:57.275
Okay, so what's the problem?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.978
Mom got a job offer
in England.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.213
What?! Who's gonna play Topanga?

13:02.215 --> 13:03.848
Wait a second,
I can play Topanga.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.250
-Eric!
-Urr-ich!

13:05.252 --> 13:07.285
Perfect.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.156
Are you gonna surprise us
with incredible advice

13:11.158 --> 13:12.390
out of your idiot mouth or not?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.458
I am, yes.
Thank you.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.660
Now, listen,
when I was elected Senator

13:15.662 --> 13:18.129
in two-thousand-aught-fifteen,
I've come to realize

13:18.131 --> 13:22.967
that what might be
a clear decision for some
is not so clear for me.

13:25.739 --> 13:26.805
Look...

13:27.974 --> 13:29.808
listen to your heart.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.510
Your heart is what's gonna
tell you what to do.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.081
And then go and find
your favorite quiet place.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.984
Mine is under the ocean.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.727
Don't take my spot!

13:55.702 --> 13:58.036
Something happened
to me and Farkle, Riley.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.137
What?

13:59.139 --> 14:01.005
Well, we were studying
molecular structure,

14:01.007 --> 14:03.975
and it occurred to us
that we are all made
with particular molecules.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.045
And if anything changes,
then we're simply not
who we were.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.013
We are actually different.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.183
That's very interesting, guys.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.518
What?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.354
If you leave us,
we will actually be different.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.725
And that's when
it occurred to me
that I was feeling sadness.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.228
I identified it as sadness,
because I was crying.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.063
-You don't cry.
-I don't cry.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.166
But now I know
it was because

14:28.168 --> 14:30.835
nothing has ever
made me sad enough before.

14:30.837 --> 14:34.405
I just wanted to say thank you
for these feelings, Riley.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.843
Oh!

14:38.845 --> 14:41.546
Smackle, getting
so good at these.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.984
-Hey, Riley.
-Hey, Zay.

14:45.986 --> 14:49.153
Just want to let you know that
I'll make sure Lucas is okay.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.255
You will?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.090
Oh, I'll walk him
and feed him

14:52.092 --> 14:54.259
and make sure
he never forgets about you.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.393
I will never forget about her.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.664
That's a good boy!
Good boy!

14:59.666 --> 15:01.165
Thank you, Zay.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.935
Want to know something?

15:03.937 --> 15:05.603
What?

15:05.605 --> 15:08.239
Our circle of friends
was never complete
until you showed up.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.076
Smackle, I'm feeling somethin'.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.945
Sadness!

15:15.248 --> 15:17.949
I'm good at emotions now.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.450
I've loved you
since the first grade.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.518
I know.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.387
I always will,
wherever you are.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.955
Thank you, Farkle,

15:23.957 --> 15:26.557
but maybe you shouldn't
say that in front of Smackle.

15:26.559 --> 15:30.261
Riley, explain the role
of uranium in nuclear fission.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.229
Uh, I don't know.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.131
Yeah, you're a threat.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.201
Guys, no decision
has been made yet.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.437
There's a good chance
she's not going anywhere.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.372
Actually, I know
she's not going anywhere

15:41.374 --> 15:43.608
because life knows
there's no replacement for her

15:43.610 --> 15:46.110
because nobody cares about me
as much as she does,

15:46.112 --> 15:48.713
so that's how I know
she's not going anywhere, so ha.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.049
Hey.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.317
What do you want?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.751
I was thinking
about you guys

15:53.753 --> 15:55.620
and what you all
must be feeling.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.623
Thought I should come over.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.993
Would it be okay if I sat
with you guys here?

16:01.995 --> 16:03.895
Oh, my gosh.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.396
I know what this is.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.065
Life is trying to replace you.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.333
Life moves fast.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.401
Life does a good job.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.338
Wait.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.140
You're actually leaving.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.011
You're really gonna go.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.114
You guys are gonna be fine.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.349
We all will be fine.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.017
We have to be fine.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.185
Okay?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.159
Smackle.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.173
No matter whatever happens
to me in my whole life,

16:49.175 --> 16:52.176
you will always be
my first girlfriend.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.178
Years from now,
whenever anybody asks me,

16:54.180 --> 16:56.214
"Who was your first girlfriend?"

16:56.216 --> 16:58.683
I will always answer,
"Riley Matthews."

16:58.685 --> 17:02.387
And I will always
answer, "Lucas Friar."

17:02.389 --> 17:05.323
I hope that you get to
be a veterinarian someday.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.959
And I hope that
wherever you are,

17:07.961 --> 17:09.927
you get to keep being Riley.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.801
Bay window?

17:17.971 --> 17:19.470
Bay window right now.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.552
My mother says that
I can't go to London with you.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.354
She wants me with her.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.355
That's what I expected.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.457
I was a little surprised.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.361
And kids have to live
with their parents' decisions.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.529
There's nothing we can do.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.331
Except hope that
they make the right ones.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.102
You know that this
won't affect us, right?

17:51.104 --> 17:55.306
I'm Mrs. Auggie Doggie Matthews
wherever you are.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.342
And I will always be Mister...

17:58.344 --> 18:01.846
♪ Ava Mor-gen-stern ♪

18:01.848 --> 18:03.314
Yeah.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.349
Yeah.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.387
Your turn now?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.122
Yeah.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.258
I don't think that we can
do any better than that.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.308
Maya?

18:32.312 --> 18:33.411
(crying)
Goodbye, Riley.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.446
No.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.493
Mom?

18:49.562 --> 18:51.162
Topanga, you're
sittin' in the dark.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.330
Yeah.
(chuckles)

18:52.332 --> 18:56.000
Sorry, I've been thinking
for a long time.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.502
Turns out...

18:57.504 --> 18:59.303
this is my quiet place.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.673
Have you made
your decision?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.642
Yes.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.744
Please don't try
to talk me out of it.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.980
We won't.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.481
We know better.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.519
You've always done
what's best for us,

19:14.521 --> 19:16.120
so do this one for you.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.022
Thank you, Cory.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.157
Yeah.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.492
No matter what it is,
we're gonna be fine.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.426
You know why?

19:22.428 --> 19:25.096
Because you have good friends.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.031
And you've had good teachers.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.534
-Yeah.
-That's a whole lot better
than what we were gonna say.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.435
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

19:32.505 --> 19:34.372
-So?
-So...

19:34.374 --> 19:37.341
there are a lot
of exciting reasons to go.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.310
A new place,
a new adventure,

19:39.312 --> 19:40.711
my promotion.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.980
There are a whole bunch
of reasons to go.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.682
You got any reasons to stay?

19:44.684 --> 19:47.018
Only one.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.854
Every time I watch
you girls in the bay window,

19:49.856 --> 19:52.890
I've remembered
how much we wanted
a place like it of our own.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.459
-Yeah, we called it a nook.
-Yeah.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.529
A place where
important decisions are made

19:58.531 --> 20:01.632
and the best next steps
of your life are planned
and considered.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.403
We would do great in England.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.872
We would do great
anywhere in the world.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.874
I could run the London office.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.443
Maybe someday, I'll get to
run the New York office.

20:13.846 --> 20:17.582
But the place
I love running

20:17.584 --> 20:20.585
is this place
that we're in right now.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.487
Where your friends come in

20:23.489 --> 20:27.592
and you plan the best
next steps of your life...

20:27.594 --> 20:29.393
like we're doing right now.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.564
This is my bay window.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.400
And I'm not leaving it.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.273
I told you she'd make
the right decision.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.341
(chuckles)

20:43.343 --> 20:45.309
(both scream)

20:52.552 --> 20:55.353
Belgium 1831.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.621
What have you learned?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.358
Farkle?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.394
There comes a time
when the right thing to do

21:03.396 --> 21:04.862
is to leave
the friends you know,

21:04.864 --> 21:06.464
see what's out there,
and face a new world.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.765
Yeah?

21:09.235 --> 21:11.035
What do you have
to say about that?

21:21.648 --> 21:22.980
Not yet.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.489
There are lots
of places you'll go.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.458
I remember another time
we were all going someplace.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.562
And what I said to...

21:38.564 --> 21:39.897
you...

21:41.234 --> 21:42.500
seems like yesterday.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.070
Come here. I want
to tell you somethin'.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.639
You know what's out there?

21:50.176 --> 21:51.642
The world.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.578
You're gonna be
part of it someday.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.646
Yeah.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.082
You're gonna learn
from it every day.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.017
Gonna make mistakes.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.686
You're gonna make
good friends, too.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.021
And even though it'll seem
like the world goes

22:04.023 --> 22:06.157
out of its way
to teach you
hard lessons...

22:06.159 --> 22:08.292
It's the same world
that gave you your friends

22:08.294 --> 22:09.927
and your family.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.964
You'll come to believe
the world is gonna
protect you, too.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.834
You're gonna come to believe
that the world is gonna
protect you, too.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.740
"Boy Meets World."

22:23.810 --> 22:25.710
Now I get it.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.380
Give me five.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.549
Give me a hug.
Come here.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.785
You ready to go inside?

22:34.787 --> 22:36.387
Topanga!

22:36.389 --> 22:38.923
-Topanga! That's me!
-(both laugh)

22:43.629 --> 22:44.695
(sighs)

22:47.734 --> 22:49.333
"Girl Meets World."

22:49.335 --> 22:50.568
Now I get it.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.704
"Topanga's."

22:53.706 --> 22:56.006
Yeah. "Topanga's."

22:56.008 --> 22:57.141
That's me.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.175
You still open?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.543
Yeah.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.812
We're not going anywhere.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.816
So, after you've met
the world for a while,

23:05.818 --> 23:10.020
the best thing that happens
is to find out just where
it is you belong.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.722
We did.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.157
Now it's your turn.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.269
Big world.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.437
Ours now.

23:26.439 --> 23:30.174
People are gonna come
in and out of our lives.

23:30.176 --> 23:33.110
Who knows where
we're all gonna end up?

23:33.112 --> 23:36.814
Who knows if the decisions
we're gonna make are
right or wrong?

23:39.886 --> 23:42.086
Promise me this?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.021
Okay.

23:44.957 --> 23:48.025
Time and distance have
no power over us.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.761
You and I are together
for as long as we live.

23:53.366 --> 23:54.665
Thunder.

23:56.402 --> 23:57.902
Lightning.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.270
Done.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.376
