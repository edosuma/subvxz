<i>Toby: Previously on Switched at Birth...</i>

00:02.208 --> 00:03.509
<i>Kathryn: Daphne texted there
was a fight in homeroom today.</i>

00:03.543 --> 00:06.137
<i>Regina: All these kids are
like, what? Juvenile delinquents?</i>

00:06.151 --> 00:07.285
<i>John: Her tire was slashed</i>

00:07.319 --> 00:08.419
the first day back at school.

00:08.544 --> 00:09.610
What are you shaking your head at me for?

00:09.645 --> 00:11.279
- I didn't.
- What?

00:11.313 --> 00:13.281
I got to go start looking for a new job.

00:13.315 --> 00:15.216
- What?
- My boss just told me

00:15.250 --> 00:17.418
that she is selling the
business and moving to London.

00:17.543 --> 00:18.609
Why don't you buy it?

00:18.644 --> 00:20.478
I cannot think of a better investment

00:20.512 --> 00:22.280
for our money than you.

00:22.347 --> 00:24.282
Hi, I'm here for community service.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.483
Your probation officer

00:25.517 --> 00:28.319
assigned you to this clinic
as a term of your probation.

00:28.353 --> 00:29.587
If you neglect to take this seriously,

00:29.621 --> 00:31.529
you can and will go back to court.

00:31.530 --> 00:35.018
____

00:35.019 --> 00:36.434
I'm Professor Ledarsky.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.669
I want you to draw a portrait

00:37.703 --> 00:39.571
of the person sitting to your left.

00:39.605 --> 00:41.706
I'm on pledge duty, so
I can't leave the house.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.308
Fine, I can come.

00:43.432 --> 00:44.832
<i>Renzo: Come on, join.</i>

00:44.867 --> 00:46.568
We could be tap buddies.

00:46.602 --> 00:49.404
And then on Thursdays, we do a drum circle.

00:49.438 --> 00:51.773
(Gasps) There's one tomorrow.
You should come with me.

00:51.807 --> 00:54.576
My husband has a charity
event for a colleague.

00:54.610 --> 00:55.710
Can't you blow it off?

00:55.744 --> 00:56.878
Connie wants me to come over tomorrow night

00:56.912 --> 00:58.713
and talk about it 'cause she's really down.

00:58.747 --> 01:00.381
You got to be there. We can't do that.

01:00.416 --> 01:01.749
Can't you just do this dinner alone?

01:01.784 --> 01:02.817
What's field hockey?

01:02.851 --> 01:05.352
It's a sport at Carlton...

01:05.387 --> 01:06.521
- that you're joining.
- (Laughs)

01:08.524 --> 01:09.824
<i>Bay: No. No way.</i>

01:09.858 --> 01:12.660
Absolutely not. Not gonna happen.

01:12.695 --> 01:15.496
- Just come on, Bay.
- Bay, you can't back out now.

01:15.531 --> 01:16.764
You already said you were gonna play.

01:16.799 --> 01:18.499
Because I was...

01:21.604 --> 01:24.505
And besides, unless
field hockey gives points

01:24.540 --> 01:26.608
for not being able to hit the ball,

01:26.642 --> 01:28.443
trust me,

01:28.477 --> 01:29.644
you don't want me on your team.

01:29.678 --> 01:30.778
<i>Daphne: This is our last chance</i>

01:30.813 --> 01:33.381
to do something together.

01:33.415 --> 01:34.816
On the list of things I hate most,

01:34.850 --> 01:38.720
sports are second only to
Thomas Kinkade paintings

01:38.754 --> 01:39.787
and spiders.

01:39.822 --> 01:41.522
Just be a sub.

01:41.557 --> 01:42.690
Any free time that I have

01:42.725 --> 01:45.493
I want to spend working on my portfolio.

01:45.527 --> 01:47.695
You will have plenty of time to draw

01:47.730 --> 01:49.697
while you're riding the bench.

01:49.732 --> 01:50.832
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:50.866 --> 01:54.702
Since when does Carlton
have a field hockey team?

01:54.737 --> 01:56.704
<i>Kathryn: Since our son and daughter</i>

01:56.739 --> 01:59.607
started one. Toby is gonna be the coach.

01:59.642 --> 02:02.410
Really?

02:02.444 --> 02:05.446
Wow, that's... good for you.

02:05.481 --> 02:07.448
Thank you.

02:07.483 --> 02:08.750
Yeah.

02:10.853 --> 02:12.353
(Sighs)

02:12.388 --> 02:15.556
Why didn't they ask me to be the coach?

02:15.591 --> 02:17.525
Do you really want me to answer that?

02:17.559 --> 02:20.461
Honey, field hockey's
not your sport, anyway.

02:20.496 --> 02:21.629
I can play field hockey.

02:21.664 --> 02:23.431
Toby: If you join the team,

02:23.465 --> 02:25.500
it'll fulfill your P.E.
requirement for the whole year.

02:25.534 --> 02:26.601
<i>Daphne: Exactly.</i>

02:26.635 --> 02:29.404
No more gym class with Coach Lubin.

02:30.439 --> 02:31.606
Oh my God, I love field hockey.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.608
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

02:33.642 --> 02:35.376

Girl's field hockey,

03:22.458 --> 03:24.425
no experience necessary.

03:26.395 --> 03:27.762
Field hockey?

03:27.796 --> 03:30.732
I'm guessing you're not interested.

03:30.766 --> 03:33.367
Yeah, yacht club's taking up all my time.

03:58.460 --> 04:01.362
- Field hockey?
- Yeah, right. Whatever.

04:03.499 --> 04:05.533
Nice, I like the shading.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.737
Good, keep working.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.508
Showing some promise.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.643
So what do you have for us, Bay?

04:17.512 --> 04:19.346
I call it...

04:20.815 --> 04:22.683
<i>- Tank.
- Hmm.</i>

04:22.718 --> 04:24.519
It's very proficient.

04:24.553 --> 04:26.387
It looks just like him.

04:26.421 --> 04:28.689
Yeah, I wanted to capture his physicality,

04:28.724 --> 04:31.392
how he dominates the space he's in.

04:31.426 --> 04:32.827
Why didn't you just take a picture?

04:34.530 --> 04:38.366
Beyond the bowling ball
and the cheeto stains,

04:38.400 --> 04:40.601
have you exposed the real Tank?

04:40.636 --> 04:42.804
Uh...

04:42.838 --> 04:45.540
I... I guess not.

04:45.574 --> 04:46.774
Okay, I think you need to do it again.

04:46.809 --> 04:48.843
What do we have here?

04:48.877 --> 04:50.845
Ahem, well...

04:52.781 --> 04:56.751
It's Bay, but from really, really high up,

04:56.785 --> 04:58.786
like outer space.

04:58.821 --> 05:00.354
<i>(Laughter)</i>

05:00.389 --> 05:01.656
Very minimalist.

05:01.690 --> 05:02.790
Yeah, yeah.

05:02.825 --> 05:05.459
Well, some artist guy sells a blank canvas

05:05.494 --> 05:06.594
for millions of dollars.

05:06.628 --> 05:08.429
I at least got a dot.

05:08.463 --> 05:09.564
That should be worth a "B," right?

05:09.598 --> 05:11.332
It depends on what kind of a statement

05:11.366 --> 05:12.500
you're making with your dot.

05:12.534 --> 05:15.336
Um...

05:15.370 --> 05:16.671
Well...

05:16.705 --> 05:20.341
It's round, uh, like...

05:20.375 --> 05:21.475
the earth.

05:22.578 --> 05:25.546
If you said your piece was a comment

05:25.581 --> 05:27.682
on Bay's feelings of isolation...

05:27.716 --> 05:30.451
if she was just an insignificant dot...

05:30.485 --> 05:32.687
I might consider giving you that "B."

05:32.721 --> 05:34.722
Okay, then let's go
with the isolation thing.

05:34.756 --> 05:37.425
Sure, I guess it's better than saying

05:37.459 --> 05:38.559
"I didn't want to do the work."

05:38.994 --> 05:43.464
No, it's not that I
didn't want to do the work.

05:44.867 --> 05:47.768
You can get away with a lot in my class.

05:47.877 --> 05:50.578
You can be offensive.

05:50.613 --> 05:52.580
You can be lewd.

05:52.615 --> 05:53.882
You can bring in your pets.

05:53.916 --> 05:55.850
You can paint with your pets.

05:55.885 --> 05:59.587
But the one thing you cannot do is not try.

05:59.622 --> 06:02.590
<i>Tank, it's been a pleasure
having you in class,</i>

06:02.625 --> 06:04.759
but you're gonna have to
pack your things and leave.

06:04.794 --> 06:06.861
Are you serious?

06:06.896 --> 06:08.530
Very.

06:08.564 --> 06:10.799
If I don't get a good grade in this class,

06:10.833 --> 06:11.833
I can't play football.

06:11.867 --> 06:13.501
Not my problem.

06:29.518 --> 06:30.752
And step, step,

06:30.786 --> 06:33.521
ball change, ball change, clap.

06:33.556 --> 06:35.523
<i>Shuffle.</i>

06:36.659 --> 06:37.859
Arms.

06:39.929 --> 06:41.563
<i>Shuffle.</i>

06:46.702 --> 06:48.737
Whoo! Good, group one.

06:48.771 --> 06:50.505
(Laughing)

06:50.539 --> 06:52.474
That time you were just showing off.

06:52.508 --> 06:53.908
Are you sure you've never done this before?

06:53.943 --> 06:56.711
I've just been holding
it in for a long time.

06:56.746 --> 06:57.812
Oh.

06:57.847 --> 06:59.481
- I'm gonna get us some water.
- Okay.

06:59.515 --> 07:00.615
<i>(Phone rings)</i>

07:05.654 --> 07:07.489
Kathryn's phone.

07:07.523 --> 07:08.623
Who is this?

07:08.657 --> 07:09.758
Who's this?

07:09.792 --> 07:11.693
This is her husband.

07:11.727 --> 07:13.561
Is my wife there?

07:13.596 --> 07:15.397
Let me see.

07:15.431 --> 07:16.431
- Is that my phone?
- Uh-huh.

07:16.465 --> 07:17.799
It's your husband. Are you available?

07:17.833 --> 07:19.667
Of course I'm available. Give me that.

07:19.702 --> 07:21.536
<i>- Hi, honey.
- Who was that?</i>

07:21.570 --> 07:22.804
Group one!

07:22.838 --> 07:23.838
Oh, I'm sorry, I have to go.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.440
<i>I just...
- Call you later, okay?</i>

07:25.474 --> 07:26.574
- Kathryn...
- Bye, hon.

07:28.878 --> 07:30.879
You realize he probably
thinks I'm having an affair.

07:30.913 --> 07:32.747
Well, you got to keep
him on his toes, honey.

07:32.782 --> 07:33.882
That's what I do.

07:33.916 --> 07:35.750
- You're terrible.
- Five, six, seven,

07:35.785 --> 07:37.652
and step right.

07:37.686 --> 07:39.454
Step, ball change.

07:46.929 --> 07:48.663
Could I talk to you for a second?

07:49.899 --> 07:53.568
It's my fault that Tank
didn't do the assignment.

07:53.602 --> 07:54.736
How's that?

07:54.770 --> 07:58.873
I am 17, so I have a curfew.

07:58.908 --> 08:01.776
And I spent so much time
working on my portrait

08:01.811 --> 08:04.679
that it didn't really leave Tank
a lot of time to do his, so...

08:04.713 --> 08:06.815
So your curfew ate his homework?

08:06.849 --> 08:08.716
I'm not buying it.

08:12.521 --> 08:14.589
Okay, ah...

08:14.623 --> 08:18.393
I had a really bad breakup.

08:18.427 --> 08:21.529
And I thought if I got drunk,

08:21.564 --> 08:24.766
I could at least forget about
the guy for a little while.

08:24.800 --> 08:29.704
<i>It was stupid, but Tank took care of me</i>

08:29.738 --> 08:32.874
and kept me from making
an even bigger mistake.

08:32.908 --> 08:36.510
And it didn't leave him
a lot of time to draw

08:36.544 --> 08:40.515
the sad, drunk high school
student trying not to vomit.

08:43.751 --> 08:47.689
That's the most authentic
thing you've said in this class.

09:03.739 --> 09:04.739
<i>Toby: Good news!</i>

09:04.773 --> 09:06.574
You all made the team.

09:06.609 --> 09:08.576
Congratulations.

09:08.611 --> 09:10.445
Welcome to our first practice.

09:10.479 --> 09:14.849
Now, everyone's gonna need
to come and grab a stick here.

09:14.884 --> 09:16.451
Bay, where're you going?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.854
To ride the bench, Coach.

09:19.979 --> 09:22.947
You're no longer a sub.
We need you to play.

09:22.982 --> 09:25.850
Ha, that wasn't the deal.

09:25.884 --> 09:27.518
We have just enough girls.

09:27.553 --> 09:29.721
So if you don't play, we don't have a team.

09:30.990 --> 09:32.790
You want me to tell all these
girls they have to go home?

09:32.825 --> 09:34.859
Are you guilting me into playing?

09:34.893 --> 09:35.860
Oh no.

09:35.894 --> 09:39.597
Just appealing to your team spirit.

09:39.632 --> 09:41.966
You should so not be
handing me a stick right now.

09:42.001 --> 09:44.636
(Blows whistle) Line up!

09:46.839 --> 09:49.907
- (Sighs)
- So tell me about your new answering service.

09:49.942 --> 09:52.644
Renzo?

09:52.678 --> 09:53.745
He's a friend.

09:53.779 --> 09:56.547
Oh, Renzo... and he's a friend.

09:56.582 --> 09:58.583
Yeah, from my class.

09:58.617 --> 10:00.652
I've been taking, um,

10:00.686 --> 10:02.954
tap dancing lessons.

10:02.988 --> 10:04.756
Since when?

10:04.790 --> 10:06.557
Just a few days.

10:08.727 --> 10:09.894
Why didn't you tell me?

10:09.928 --> 10:11.796
'Cause I thought you'd think it was silly.

10:11.830 --> 10:14.832
So keeping it secret has
nothing to do with Renzo?

10:14.867 --> 10:18.670
As much as I love that
you're a little bit jealous,

10:18.704 --> 10:21.005
you don't have to worry. Renzo is gay.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.941
Oh. (Clears throat)

10:23.976 --> 10:26.778
You know what? I'll invite him
to dinner and you can meet him.

10:26.812 --> 10:28.846
No, no, that's not necessary.

10:28.881 --> 10:30.982
Too late. I love the idea.

10:31.016 --> 10:32.617
And you're gonna love him.

10:32.651 --> 10:33.818
(Clears throat)

10:40.059 --> 10:41.592
(Sighs)

10:43.551 --> 10:47.119
Jorge: Daphne. Daphne, get the phone... oh.

10:50.390 --> 10:52.157
<i>(Ringing continues)</i>

10:52.192 --> 10:54.960
<i>Jorge: Thank you for calling
the community free clinic.</i>

10:59.399 --> 11:01.133
What's this?

11:01.167 --> 11:03.902
When somebody calls out
for you to answer the phone,

11:03.937 --> 11:05.838
they have to put a dollar in the jar.

11:05.872 --> 11:07.840
Does it happen very often?

11:07.874 --> 11:08.974
Three times today.

11:09.008 --> 11:10.242
Yeah, phones aren't my friend.

11:10.276 --> 11:11.844
Mine either.

11:11.878 --> 11:13.112
Every time I call for takeout,

11:13.146 --> 11:15.180
they think it's a prank call and hang up.

11:15.215 --> 11:16.215
Why?

11:16.249 --> 11:17.316
'Cause of the way I talk.

11:17.350 --> 11:18.951
What do you mean?

11:18.985 --> 11:21.253
Right, actually, nothing.

11:21.287 --> 11:23.155
I sound amazing.

11:23.189 --> 11:27.259
I should do car commercials or sing opera.

11:27.293 --> 11:30.229
Nerve damage from the accident

11:30.263 --> 11:33.065
gave me a little bit
of a speech impediment.

11:33.099 --> 11:34.933
Doesn't bother me.

11:36.236 --> 11:38.871
Hey, hi, yeah, is this gonna take long?

11:38.905 --> 11:40.305
'Cause I just need a brace for my wrist.

11:40.340 --> 11:42.007
Ah, I'm not sure.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.275
They may want to do an X-ray.

11:43.309 --> 11:45.110
Oh, no, no. It's not broken.

11:45.145 --> 11:47.012
- How do you know that?
- Well, 'cause last time

11:47.046 --> 11:48.247
I broke it, it didn't feel like this.

11:48.281 --> 11:49.314
<i>Nice deck.</i>

11:49.349 --> 11:51.116
How'd you bang up your wrist?

11:51.151 --> 11:52.050
Busted McTwist.

11:52.085 --> 11:53.318
Yeah, I came off the ramp,

11:53.353 --> 11:54.987
<i>made the 540 all the way around.</i>

11:55.021 --> 11:57.423
Then my back truck got
hung up on the way down.

11:57.427 --> 11:59.815
- Damn, almost had it.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

11:59.816 --> 12:01.950
That's why I wanna hurry this thing along,

12:01.961 --> 12:03.929
so I can get back out there and land one.

12:03.963 --> 12:06.231
Well, you forgot to put down an address.

12:06.266 --> 12:09.067
Uh, yeah, well, I'm kind of
couch surfing at the moment.

12:10.236 --> 12:12.304
- She'll take you back.
- Thanks, man.

12:17.277 --> 12:19.878
I can't believe after
doing that to his wrist,

12:19.913 --> 12:20.946
all that guy can think about

12:20.980 --> 12:22.881
is getting back out on a ramp.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.283
You've never landed a McTwist.

12:27.987 --> 12:29.855
(Sighs)

12:29.889 --> 12:32.991
I just spent two hours
at the car dealership

12:33.026 --> 12:34.326
ready to plop down my money

12:34.360 --> 12:35.994
and the guy keeps asking me

12:36.029 --> 12:38.096
if I want to come back with my husband.

12:38.131 --> 12:40.065
Oh, you're getting a new car?

12:40.099 --> 12:42.267
Well, I'm supposed to
be a high-end designer.

12:42.302 --> 12:43.902
I need to look the part.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.070
Mm-hmm.

12:45.104 --> 12:46.338
Oh.

12:46.372 --> 12:49.041
You're never going to
believe who I ran into today.

12:49.075 --> 12:51.243
- Felicia.
- Really?

12:51.277 --> 12:53.078
How is she?

12:53.112 --> 12:54.279
Pregnant.

12:54.314 --> 12:56.081
Eight months along.

12:56.115 --> 12:58.183
Wow, it has been a long time.

12:58.218 --> 13:00.252
And I'm not saying this
because I'm your mother,

13:00.286 --> 13:02.154
but whoever is doing her hair these days

13:02.188 --> 13:04.857
- is her enemy.
- (Laughs)

13:04.891 --> 13:07.893
I told her all about your new business

13:07.927 --> 13:09.094
and she's so happy for you.

13:09.128 --> 13:11.163
Oh, yeah, I should send
something for the baby.

13:11.197 --> 13:13.198
Actually, she could use
some help with her nursery.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.167
I told her you would be perfect for it.

13:15.201 --> 13:18.971
Mom, I don't even own k&d yet.

13:19.005 --> 13:20.839
And I'm already in over my head.

13:20.874 --> 13:23.108
I don't have time for volunteer work.

13:23.142 --> 13:24.243
She's your cousin.

13:24.277 --> 13:25.978
Second cousin.

13:26.012 --> 13:28.847
- (Sighs)
- What I need right now are jobs that pay.

13:28.882 --> 13:31.049
Regina, helping out family

13:31.084 --> 13:33.085
isn't going to ruin your business.

13:33.119 --> 13:34.987
If you can afford a new car,

13:35.021 --> 13:37.289
you can afford to help your cousin Felicia.

13:42.128 --> 13:44.096
(Sighs)

13:57.073 --> 13:59.241
Hey, where did Aaron Legrange go?

13:59.275 --> 14:00.776
Who?

14:00.810 --> 14:01.910
The skater kid.

14:01.945 --> 14:03.879
Oh, he left a few minutes ago.

14:03.913 --> 14:05.013
Damn.

14:05.048 --> 14:07.916
<i>- Did I mess up again?
- No.</i>

14:07.951 --> 14:09.885
Well, yeah.

14:09.919 --> 14:11.220
<i>Patients aren't supposed to leave</i>

14:11.254 --> 14:13.082
<i>unless they've been signed out.</i>

14:13.176 --> 14:14.910
But he got his wrist brace.

14:14.944 --> 14:16.779
We got his blood work back

14:16.813 --> 14:18.680
and his glucose levels were high.

14:18.715 --> 14:20.749
Dr. J. wanted to talk
to him before he left.

14:20.784 --> 14:23.085
Oh, crap.

14:23.119 --> 14:25.020
I can't catch a break with that guy.

14:25.054 --> 14:26.722
I'll think of something.

14:26.756 --> 14:27.956
He didn't leave an address.

14:27.991 --> 14:30.025
And I have to get to field hockey practice.

14:30.059 --> 14:32.795
Just go. I'll stall Dr. J.

14:32.829 --> 14:34.129
I'll tell him the kid's coming in tomorrow.

14:34.164 --> 14:37.099
Thanks again.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.801
No worries.

14:44.908 --> 14:45.908
<i>Toby: All right, guys.</i>

14:45.942 --> 14:47.810
(Blows whistle) Let's bring it in.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.188
Okay, today we're gonna start

14:59.222 --> 15:02.925
with a two-on-one
offensive-defensive drill.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.861
You six are going to be the forwards.

15:05.895 --> 15:07.663
One player from each line

15:07.697 --> 15:10.098
<i>is gonna bring the ball
down the field, okay?</i>

15:10.133 --> 15:11.967
Use what we worked on last practice.

15:12.001 --> 15:15.804
You know, dribble,
dribble, pass. All right?

15:15.839 --> 15:17.005
<i>You got it?</i>

15:17.040 --> 15:19.007
<i>Uh, you five are going to be the defense.</i>

15:19.042 --> 15:20.075
<i>You're going to form one line</i>

15:20.109 --> 15:21.777
<i>right here behind this cone.</i>

15:21.811 --> 15:23.979
<i>Your job is to stop the forwards.</i>

15:24.013 --> 15:26.748
<i>Get your stick in there, steal that ball.</i>

15:26.783 --> 15:28.150
<i>Everybody got it?</i>

15:28.184 --> 15:29.885
Let's do it.

15:33.056 --> 15:34.990
Bay, it looks like you're up first.

15:35.024 --> 15:36.859
(Nervous laugh)

15:36.893 --> 15:38.827
Ready? (Blows whistle)

15:40.930 --> 15:42.064
(Squeals)

15:45.101 --> 15:46.168
<i>- Nice shot.
- Bay.</i>

15:46.202 --> 15:48.770
You can't turn your back on the play.

15:48.805 --> 15:49.972
I don't even know what that means.

15:50.006 --> 15:52.007
It's your job to stop them from scoring.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.742
Okay, get your stick in there.

15:53.776 --> 15:54.910
Steal the ball. Intercept the pass.

15:54.944 --> 15:56.011
Something.

15:56.045 --> 15:58.013
And don't squeal.

15:58.047 --> 15:59.815
It's not very intimidating.

15:59.849 --> 16:01.850
I think the fact that I'm not intimidating

16:01.885 --> 16:04.052
is what actually makes
me not very intimidating.

16:04.087 --> 16:05.821
Bay, can you just be serious?

16:05.855 --> 16:07.656
Get in there and disrupt
the play, all right?

16:08.925 --> 16:10.659
Let's try this again.

16:15.732 --> 16:17.766
And... (Blows whistle)

16:18.935 --> 16:20.736
(Grunts) Oh!

16:20.770 --> 16:22.938
(Gasps)

16:22.972 --> 16:24.673
<i>(Bay grunts)</i>

16:27.143 --> 16:29.745
- (Sighs)
- Are you all right?

16:29.779 --> 16:31.780
- No.
- Well, that was a good start.

16:31.814 --> 16:32.881
You at least got yourself in there.

16:32.916 --> 16:33.916
Now let's try it again.

16:33.950 --> 16:35.017
I'm sorry,

16:35.051 --> 16:37.019
did you not just see me get steamrolled?

16:37.053 --> 16:39.821
Shake it off and let's do it again!

16:39.856 --> 16:41.924
- No.
- Bay, I am your coach.

16:41.958 --> 16:43.125
You need to start listening to me.

16:43.159 --> 16:45.160
I did and look what just happened.

16:45.194 --> 16:47.930
Bay, stop being a little
baby and start trying.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.633
I don't even want to be here.

16:49.667 --> 16:50.767
You tricked me into playing

16:50.802 --> 16:52.069
and now you're yelling at me. So I'm done.

16:52.103 --> 16:53.937
What?! We don't quit.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.672
I do.

16:55.707 --> 16:57.708
Where are you going?

18:34.405 --> 18:38.308
♪ Classical piano ♪

18:43.553 --> 18:45.654
- (Laughing)
- Congratulations.

18:45.689 --> 18:48.357
Look at you.

18:48.391 --> 18:49.792
Oh, well, look at you,

18:49.826 --> 18:53.796
living in Mission Hills,
running your own business.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.798
Oh, I love your bag.

18:55.832 --> 18:58.467
(Sighs) Thanks.

18:58.501 --> 19:01.270
Kind of makes me hope this one
gets switched at the hospital.

19:03.573 --> 19:06.542
Oh, you know I'm kidding. (Laughs)

19:06.576 --> 19:08.477
Oh right.

19:08.511 --> 19:10.713
So you're in the homestretch, huh?

19:10.747 --> 19:13.282
Honestly, I'm ready for it to be over with.

19:13.316 --> 19:14.316
Yeah.

19:14.350 --> 19:16.351
I really appreciate you doing this.

19:16.386 --> 19:17.753
I know how valuable your time is.

19:17.787 --> 19:19.488
Oh, no, no. Don't worry about it.

19:19.522 --> 19:20.723
I have plenty of time for you.

19:20.757 --> 19:24.727
Well, I don't have a big budget for this.

19:24.761 --> 19:26.495
I was kind of hoping

19:26.529 --> 19:29.598
you could use some of
the stuff that's here.

19:29.632 --> 19:31.567
Sure.

19:31.601 --> 19:33.502
So, um, what were you thinking?

19:33.536 --> 19:36.505
Oh, me and Harry's bedroom
will turn into the nursery.

19:36.539 --> 19:39.541
And we'll just move out
here into the living room.

19:40.543 --> 19:43.779
So...

19:48.485 --> 19:50.352
It's really two rooms,

19:50.420 --> 19:53.322
the baby's room and turning the living room

19:53.356 --> 19:54.623
into a bedroom.

19:54.657 --> 19:56.592
Is that okay?

19:56.626 --> 19:58.627
Yeah, it's fine.

19:58.661 --> 20:00.796
Yeah.

20:02.365 --> 20:03.732
Yeah.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.667
Yeah.

20:19.749 --> 20:22.417
Hey.

20:23.686 --> 20:25.621
Hey.

20:25.655 --> 20:27.623
I'm sorry about today.

20:27.657 --> 20:29.792
I, uh...

20:29.826 --> 20:32.761
I was just frustrated that
I didn't have enough players

20:32.796 --> 20:36.431
and I suddenly turned into dad.

20:36.466 --> 20:38.367
And there wasn't even a full moon.

20:38.401 --> 20:40.502
Hey, maybe you should be happy

20:40.537 --> 20:42.404
you dodged that D.N.A. bullet.

20:46.442 --> 20:49.378
Artist's block?

20:49.412 --> 20:51.547
Kind of.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.717
Art was the one thing I knew I was good at.

20:55.752 --> 20:58.520
And now I just don't know anymore.

20:58.555 --> 20:59.488
There... there are people in my class

20:59.522 --> 21:01.390
who can hardly sharpen a pencil

21:01.424 --> 21:02.791
and my Professor gives them a pass.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.493
And me...

21:04.527 --> 21:05.694
In my experience,

21:05.728 --> 21:07.596
coaches are hardest on the players

21:07.630 --> 21:09.464
that they think have real talent.

21:09.499 --> 21:11.667
Is that why you're so hard on me, Coach?

21:11.701 --> 21:15.337
- (Laughs)
- I didn't think so.

21:15.371 --> 21:17.706
<i>Kathryn: Bay, Toby, dinner.</i>

21:17.740 --> 21:19.741
(Sighing)

21:19.776 --> 21:21.577
Here we go.

21:24.681 --> 21:26.782
Guess who's coming to dinner?

21:26.816 --> 21:28.383
Me!

21:28.418 --> 21:29.418
(Laughs)

21:29.452 --> 21:30.419
You look fantastic.

21:30.453 --> 21:32.421
I know! For the hostess.

21:32.455 --> 21:33.522
Oh.

21:34.524 --> 21:36.758
Come on in.

21:36.793 --> 21:38.627
This is Bay and this is Toby.

21:38.661 --> 21:40.429
You'll meet Daphne another time.

21:40.463 --> 21:41.496
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

21:41.531 --> 21:42.764
- Hey.
- Oh, no, come on.

21:42.799 --> 21:44.366
Give Uncle Renzo a big hug.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.734
- Oh.
- (Laughs)

21:45.768 --> 21:48.537
- Hello.
- Senator Kennish.

21:48.571 --> 21:50.639
Do you like hearing that?
Because I love saying it.

21:50.673 --> 21:52.407
Renzo.

21:52.442 --> 21:54.776
I hope this isn't considered a bribe.

21:54.811 --> 21:57.512
Oh, wow. Aged 25 years.

21:57.547 --> 21:58.780
Just like me. (Giggles)

21:58.815 --> 22:00.515
Careful though. A few shots of that

22:00.550 --> 22:02.451
and you might go from third
baseman to switch-hitter.

22:02.485 --> 22:04.353
(Laughing)

22:04.387 --> 22:06.655
Kathy, come on. Show me around this dump.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.693
This is gonna be fun.

22:11.728 --> 22:12.794
(Laughs)

22:18.434 --> 22:19.768
Have a good night.

22:22.705 --> 22:24.606
I totally know how to
find the skateboarder.

22:24.641 --> 22:25.674
I told you I'd figure something.

22:25.708 --> 22:26.742
(Laughs)

22:26.776 --> 22:28.677
Well, his board was covered in stickers,

22:28.711 --> 22:30.579
one of which was Trucks Board Shop.

22:30.613 --> 22:32.414
So I figured maybe somebody there

22:32.448 --> 22:34.383
would know who he was or
where we could find him.

22:34.417 --> 22:35.550
That's awesome. You called the shop?

22:35.585 --> 22:37.686
Oh, you're deaf.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.454
I totally didn't...

22:39.489 --> 22:41.623
I owe that jar a dollar.

22:41.658 --> 22:44.559
Well, I did stop by the shop,
but I spoke with the owner.

22:44.594 --> 22:48.497
And he let me know that there's a
skater hangout by the flood canal.

22:48.531 --> 22:50.365
So maybe we could find Aaron there.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.567
Gee, you're a total deaf-tective.

22:52.602 --> 22:54.369
- What?
- Nothing.

22:54.404 --> 22:55.671
Let's go.

23:51.828 --> 23:55.530

23:58.768 --> 24:01.303
- Whoo!
- This place is crazy.

24:01.337 --> 24:03.338
Yeah.

24:03.373 --> 24:04.673
Oh, there he is.

24:06.342 --> 24:07.442
Hey, I know you two.

24:07.477 --> 24:09.478
Yeah, uh, we're from the clinic.

24:09.512 --> 24:10.612
You saw us earlier today.

24:10.646 --> 24:12.781
Yeah, so what's up? You guys came to ride?

24:12.815 --> 24:15.317
I don't have the right kind of wheels.

24:15.351 --> 24:16.485
<i>You actually left the clinic</i>

24:16.519 --> 24:18.420
<i>before your labs came back.</i>

24:18.454 --> 24:20.455
Your sugar levels were off the charts.

24:20.490 --> 24:22.324
You could have diabetes.

24:22.358 --> 24:24.393
Yeah, no kidding.

24:24.427 --> 24:25.660
<i>Daphne: You know?</i>

24:25.695 --> 24:28.597
Well, are you watching what
you eat and taking Insulin?

24:28.631 --> 24:30.632
- Kind of.
- Hey, no.

24:30.666 --> 24:32.601
If you don't take this seriously,

24:32.635 --> 24:34.569
you could have a stroke or go blind.

24:34.604 --> 24:35.771
Look, it's a pain in the ass.

24:36.839 --> 24:38.707
<i>Campbell: Dude, I get it.</i>

24:38.741 --> 24:41.443
I do leg stretches day after day.

24:41.477 --> 24:43.412
You don't think I know how hard it is?

24:43.446 --> 24:44.413
Yeah, well, that sucks.

24:44.447 --> 24:45.607
Hey, you know, one day,

24:45.610 --> 24:49.110
they're gonna find a way to fix *** injuries,

24:49.115 --> 24:51.820
and when that happens, I
want to be ready to walk.

24:51.854 --> 24:53.422
Is that right?

24:53.456 --> 24:55.424
Don't you want to be around

24:55.458 --> 24:57.659
when they come up with a cure for diabetes?

24:57.693 --> 25:00.462
Look, I understand what
you guys are trying to do

25:00.496 --> 25:01.530
and I appreciate it.

25:02.498 --> 25:03.665
But that's just not for me.

25:03.699 --> 25:05.734
Hey, dude, do me a solid.

25:05.768 --> 25:07.636
(Skaters chattering)

25:08.638 --> 25:10.305
Help me out with this girl.

25:11.541 --> 25:14.709
My boss is pissed that
she let you walk out.

25:16.579 --> 25:17.679
<i>Just come by the clinic.</i>

25:17.713 --> 25:20.549
Talk to the doc about your diabetes

25:20.583 --> 25:22.350
so she won't get fired.

25:27.390 --> 25:29.558
Okay. Sure, whatever.

25:29.592 --> 25:30.759
Awesome.

25:35.498 --> 25:37.365
What happened?

25:37.400 --> 25:38.800
He's coming by the clinic.

25:38.835 --> 25:40.769
What? What did you say to him?

25:40.803 --> 25:43.371
Guy talk.

25:43.406 --> 25:44.706
Nice save.

25:45.741 --> 25:46.741
So, um...

25:48.444 --> 25:50.679
do you really think you'll
be able to walk again?

25:50.713 --> 25:51.813
Absolutely.

25:51.848 --> 25:55.450
<i>And I'm gonna do that again.</i>

25:56.419 --> 25:58.620

26:14.551 --> 26:16.686
<i>Campbell: Once I'm back on my feet again,</i>

26:16.720 --> 26:18.854
it won't take me that long
to get back on a board.

26:18.889 --> 26:19.955
Seriously?

26:19.990 --> 26:21.691
What if you crash again?

26:21.725 --> 26:23.526
I'm not gonna do tricks

26:23.560 --> 26:25.728
and I'm not gonna be a complete idiot,

26:25.762 --> 26:28.531
but I am gonna ride again.

26:28.565 --> 26:29.965
Why would you even risk it?

26:30.000 --> 26:34.837
If somebody could give
you back your hearing,

26:34.871 --> 26:35.938
wouldn't you do it?

26:38.008 --> 26:39.909
No.

26:39.943 --> 26:40.943
It's part of who I am.

26:42.946 --> 26:45.681
Hearing people don't understand it,

26:45.716 --> 26:48.617
but I like being deaf.

26:50.921 --> 26:53.723
Do you remember what it was like to hear?

26:53.757 --> 26:55.925
No.

26:58.729 --> 27:00.930
Well...

27:00.964 --> 27:03.766
I remember what it was like to walk.

27:06.870 --> 27:09.739

28:57.848 --> 29:00.483
(Sighs) Okay, I'm sorry.

29:00.517 --> 29:01.717
I made up the thing about Connie,

29:01.751 --> 29:03.752
but I didn't want to go to that dinner

29:03.787 --> 29:05.821

29:41.691 --> 29:43.526
(Sighs deeply) Oh, yeah.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.827
I went to the neighborhood.

29:44.861 --> 29:46.962
I mean, same one we lived in forever.

29:46.997 --> 29:48.697
And I saw her apartment

29:48.732 --> 29:49.899
and I can't imagine

29:49.933 --> 29:52.835
that we ever lived in a place that small.

29:52.869 --> 29:54.603
I miss it sometimes.

29:54.638 --> 29:55.871
Our place in East Riverside?

29:55.906 --> 29:58.607
We knew all of our neighbors.

29:58.675 --> 29:59.909
We had block parties.

29:59.943 --> 30:02.745
If I needed a can of tomato paste,

30:02.779 --> 30:04.547
I would just call out the window

30:04.581 --> 30:07.750
and Mari or Ricky would pick
one up on their way home.

30:07.784 --> 30:11.654
I don't know anyone on this block.

30:11.688 --> 30:13.956
That's because the next
house is half a mile away.

30:13.990 --> 30:15.658
(Laughs)

30:15.692 --> 30:17.526
We used to walk everywhere

30:17.561 --> 30:18.894
and hang out on people's porches.

30:18.929 --> 30:20.529
Hmm.

30:20.564 --> 30:22.898
Here, people just keep to themselves

30:22.933 --> 30:24.867
in big houses and...

30:24.901 --> 30:26.936
hang out in their own backyard.

30:26.970 --> 30:29.905
Driving around in their big cars.

30:29.940 --> 30:31.941
(Sighs)

30:31.975 --> 30:34.777
And now Felicia thinks that
I am one of these people.

30:34.811 --> 30:37.813
She wants me to redo
her place with no money.

30:37.847 --> 30:41.850
Mom, you were the queen of
decorating with no money.

30:41.885 --> 30:44.553
- (Mouths)
- You took a pink fan

30:44.588 --> 30:46.989
and a colander and turned it into a lamp.

30:47.023 --> 30:49.959
It was a hamster wheel.

30:49.993 --> 30:51.627
It was awesome.

30:51.661 --> 30:53.729
It was.

30:53.763 --> 30:55.798

I had nothing to do with it.

31:01.638 --> 31:02.838
Everything okay?

31:02.872 --> 31:05.574
Nothing a drum circle wouldn't fix.

31:05.609 --> 31:08.944
I am so sorry.

31:08.979 --> 31:10.913
Please, please, don't blame Kathryn.

31:10.947 --> 31:12.948
I practically dragged
her. This is all my fault.

31:12.983 --> 31:14.850
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

31:14.884 --> 31:18.621
I do this. I push too far.

31:18.655 --> 31:20.522
You're such nice people

31:20.557 --> 31:21.991
and I ruined your evening.

31:22.025 --> 31:24.893
So I should probably go.

31:24.928 --> 31:26.895
That would be a good idea.

31:28.832 --> 31:30.899
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:30.934 --> 31:32.868
(Silent)

31:37.707 --> 31:39.708
So you made up the whole story

31:39.743 --> 31:41.010
about Connie being depressed

31:41.044 --> 31:42.400
and how she needed you.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.639
- Did he put you up to that?
- No!

31:43.640 --> 31:45.044
You didn't use to lie to me.

31:45.045 --> 31:46.254
I said I was sorry.

31:46.903 --> 31:49.012
Was the idea of having
dinner with me so awful?

31:49.048 --> 31:50.983
Enough about the dinner, John!

31:50.987 --> 31:53.589
In case you haven't noticed,

31:53.623 --> 31:55.691
I've been really sad lately.

31:55.725 --> 31:57.593
And flitting around with
this guy's gonna help?

31:59.496 --> 32:01.497
Is that what this is about?
The fact that he's gay?

32:01.531 --> 32:02.664
I don't have a problem with him being gay.

32:02.699 --> 32:04.833
- John.
- I had guys on my team. They were gay.

32:04.868 --> 32:06.535
They didn't rub it in your face.

32:06.569 --> 32:07.903
So you'd be okay with Renzo

32:07.937 --> 32:09.638
as long as he pretended he wasn't gay?

32:09.672 --> 32:10.672
That's not what I meant.

32:10.707 --> 32:11.874
Well, he's not gonna do that.

32:11.908 --> 32:14.710
And I am tired of
pretending that I'm happy.

32:38.847 --> 32:40.681

32:53.995 --> 32:55.763
All of the students

32:55.797 --> 32:57.798
who don't want to play field hockey.

32:57.832 --> 32:59.533
Well, there's no more debate team.

32:59.567 --> 33:01.769
So maybe some of those
girls would be interested.

33:01.803 --> 33:04.872
We need real athletes.

33:04.971 --> 33:06.905
I really wanted this girl

33:06.940 --> 33:09.641
who went all-county as a freshman,

33:09.676 --> 33:11.744
but she won't call me back.

33:11.778 --> 33:14.580
Um, Sharee Gifford.

33:14.614 --> 33:18.050
Yeah, trust me, you
don't need that headache.

33:18.084 --> 33:20.753
Have you seen her basketball stats?

33:20.787 --> 33:24.590
I mean, she scored over
600 points last season.

33:24.624 --> 33:25.858
It's not that impressive.

33:25.892 --> 33:30.029
Well, it is considering she was
suspended for half the season.

33:33.033 --> 33:35.701
Oh well.

33:35.735 --> 33:38.604
On to the next one. (Sighs)

33:40.974 --> 33:42.808
(Students chatter)

33:48.014 --> 33:49.848
Hey, Sharee.

33:51.918 --> 33:54.820
You know, we could use some of those skills

33:54.854 --> 33:56.722
on the field hockey team.

33:56.756 --> 33:58.757
- I don't do rich girl sports.
- Why?

33:58.792 --> 34:00.626
Are you afraid you're
gonna embarrass yourself?

34:00.660 --> 34:01.860
You think that's gonna work on me?

34:01.895 --> 34:03.962
I don't want to play with you scrubs.

34:03.997 --> 34:08.036
All right then, fine.

34:08.071 --> 34:09.638
You don't want to play field hockey.?

34:09.672 --> 34:10.906
What are you talking about?

34:10.940 --> 34:12.608
You and me, one on one.

34:12.641 --> 34:14.643
If I win, then you got to join the team.

34:14.678 --> 34:15.744
And what do I get when I win?

34:15.779 --> 34:17.012
What do you want?

34:17.047 --> 34:20.783
I hate taking that bus.

34:20.817 --> 34:22.918
I win, you drive me to
school every morning.

34:22.952 --> 34:24.887
No way, I am not doing that.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.722
Then no way am I joining your little team.

34:27.924 --> 34:30.626
Fine, you're on.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.936
All right, let's begin with
the long-awaited unveiling

34:40.969 --> 34:42.938
of Tank's latest creation.

34:47.976 --> 34:49.011
Hmm.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.045
Mixed media.

34:51.915 --> 34:55.083
Yeah, well, that hair will not
be contained in two dimensions.

34:59.789 --> 35:02.691
You let a limitation
lead you into inspiration.

35:04.694 --> 35:05.828
Welcome back to the class.

35:07.997 --> 35:11.033
I revised my portrait as well.

35:16.673 --> 35:18.073
It's x's and o's,

35:18.108 --> 35:20.743
uh, like the kind that you would

35:20.777 --> 35:22.711
see in a football playbook.

35:22.746 --> 35:25.647
Kind of like
pointillism or "x-o-ism."

35:27.851 --> 35:31.053
<i>I really wanted to focus on
capturing Tank as a leader.</i>

35:33.823 --> 35:34.890
Hmm.

35:35.892 --> 35:37.760
That's super freaking cool.

35:46.069 --> 35:48.637
- First one to ten.
- Check it.

35:54.010 --> 35:58.747
- Whoa.
- (Grunts)

35:58.782 --> 35:59.982
Sharee: One.

36:04.954 --> 36:05.921
<i>Daphne: Two.</i>

36:08.992 --> 36:10.759
Three.

36:13.997 --> 36:14.963
Hey.

36:16.099 --> 36:17.699
Four.

36:18.735 --> 36:19.935
- (Grunting)
- Hey.

36:21.738 --> 36:22.704
Four.

36:26.843 --> 36:27.843
- Hey.
- Five.

36:32.715 --> 36:33.682
Six.

36:33.716 --> 36:34.716
Six.

36:34.751 --> 36:36.051
Six.

36:36.085 --> 36:37.886
<i>Sharee: Seven.</i>

36:37.921 --> 36:39.822
<i>- Eight.
- Eight.</i>

36:42.091 --> 36:43.826
Nine, all.

36:43.860 --> 36:45.093
Next point wins.

36:56.773 --> 36:57.840
Got it!

36:57.874 --> 36:59.775
(No audio)

36:59.809 --> 37:01.743
(Pants)

37:01.778 --> 37:03.712
See you at 7:00.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.950
Oh, and I like breakfast burritos.

37:21.099 --> 37:22.866
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:22.901 --> 37:25.068
Off to dance class?

37:25.103 --> 37:27.037
As a matter of fact, I am.

37:30.975 --> 37:33.744
And after that, I'm gonna
go see my psychiatrist.

37:35.079 --> 37:36.847
See you later.

37:40.919 --> 37:42.886
Oh.

37:45.954 --> 37:47.821
Toby: Okay, Bay, you're an artist.

37:47.856 --> 37:49.590
You think visually.

37:49.624 --> 37:50.858
So what I want you to do

37:50.892 --> 37:54.495
is picture yourself scoring that goal.

37:54.529 --> 37:55.929
- Are you picturing it?
- Yeah.

37:55.964 --> 37:58.532
Okay, this ball right here

37:58.566 --> 38:00.401
is Thomas Kinkade

38:00.435 --> 38:02.503
and all of his cheesy corporate art.

38:02.537 --> 38:04.872
Now I want you to take
that cheesy corporate art

38:04.906 --> 38:07.508
and I want you to smash it! All right?

38:11.513 --> 38:12.579
Yes! Fantastic!

38:12.614 --> 38:13.430
(Squeals)

38:13.435 --> 38:14.502
Well, I mean, don't sign me up

38:14.536 --> 38:16.470
for a field hockey
scholarship anytime soon,

38:16.505 --> 38:18.239
- but, ah, whoo!
- Yeah!

38:21.610 --> 38:23.344
Uh, can I help you?

38:23.378 --> 38:24.545
I'm Sharee Gifford.

38:24.579 --> 38:27.448
Oh, right. So you're here to play?

38:27.482 --> 38:28.682
If she's the best player you got,

38:30.318 --> 38:31.385
you're gonna need me.

38:34.356 --> 38:35.422
<i>Toby: Okay.</i>

38:36.525 --> 38:38.592
Well, grab a stick then.

38:38.627 --> 38:40.394
Okay.

38:40.428 --> 38:41.562
Good news, Bay.

38:41.596 --> 38:42.730
You're back to riding the bench.

38:42.764 --> 38:45.699
Oh.

38:45.734 --> 38:47.501
Yeah, okay.

38:50.705 --> 38:52.273
Yes!

38:54.743 --> 38:57.344
<i>(Rummaging)</i>

38:58.346 --> 39:00.414
Hey. Hey!

39:00.448 --> 39:02.650
Excuse me.

39:02.684 --> 39:04.518
Who's in there?

39:04.553 --> 39:05.686
- Oh.
- Hi.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.688
You know, the recycling
bins are over there.

39:07.722 --> 39:09.456
Thanks.

39:09.491 --> 39:12.526
I'm not actually here for cans.

39:12.561 --> 39:16.330
I was actually thinking of
turning this into a lamp.

39:16.364 --> 39:17.698
- A lamp?
- Yeah.

39:17.732 --> 39:20.401
I have a friend who wants something cool

39:20.435 --> 39:22.503
and doesn't have a lot of money.

39:22.537 --> 39:25.439
I love vintage metal work.

39:25.473 --> 39:28.242
I'm sorry. Is this your trash?

39:28.276 --> 39:29.410
Well, I'm overseeing the renovations.

39:29.444 --> 39:30.611
So yeah, I guess it is.

39:30.645 --> 39:33.647
You know, you don't seem
like the dumpster-diving type.

39:33.682 --> 39:37.251
I actually am...

39:37.285 --> 39:39.520
the dumpster-diving type.

39:41.656 --> 39:43.724
So what is this gonna be?

39:43.758 --> 39:45.726
A loft space

39:45.760 --> 39:47.428
for short-term corporate housing.

39:47.462 --> 39:49.597
Okay if I take this?

39:49.631 --> 39:52.399
And this?

39:52.434 --> 39:53.667
And that?

39:53.702 --> 39:55.669
Yeah, yeah, sure.

39:55.704 --> 39:57.605
Take whatever you want.

40:00.609 --> 40:03.277
And if anyone gives you any trouble,

40:03.311 --> 40:05.613
just tell them that Wes said it was okay.

40:05.647 --> 40:07.481
Okay, I will.

40:07.515 --> 40:09.350
And good luck with your lamp.

40:09.384 --> 40:11.385
Thanks.

40:16.358 --> 40:17.558
Here you go.

40:17.592 --> 40:18.692
Thank you.

40:18.727 --> 40:21.462
So last night I was
watching a bunch of these

40:21.496 --> 40:22.529
snowboarding videos.

40:22.564 --> 40:23.530
You have to try it.

40:23.565 --> 40:24.665
<i>Yeah, no.</i>

40:24.699 --> 40:26.400
But I did see a trailer

40:26.434 --> 40:28.402
for a new snowboarding documentary.

40:28.436 --> 40:29.503
- "Carving Air"?
- Yes!

40:29.537 --> 40:30.738
Yeah, I have a few buddies in it.

40:30.772 --> 40:33.507
Well, we should totally go
see it when it comes out.

40:33.541 --> 40:36.443
- Yeah.
- Hey, baby.

40:36.478 --> 40:37.511
- (Laughs, kisses)
- Hey.

40:39.547 --> 40:41.649
Daphne, this is Gretchen.

40:41.683 --> 40:42.683
Gretchen, this is Daphne.

40:42.717 --> 40:45.486
Hi, nice to meet you.

40:45.520 --> 40:46.487
Nice to meet you too.

40:46.521 --> 40:48.622
Uh, so, um...

40:48.657 --> 40:50.457
Surprise.

40:50.492 --> 40:51.759
- So what's going on?
- Nothing much.

40:51.793 --> 40:53.360
- How are you doing today?
- Good.

40:53.395 --> 40:54.762
(Muted talking)

40:57.732 --> 40:59.500
Hi.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.272
I'm pretty sure we're gonna
lose every game this season,

41:05.307 --> 41:06.473
but on the plus side,

41:06.508 --> 41:09.643
I apparently will not
be contributing to that.

41:16.484 --> 41:18.419
Starving.
