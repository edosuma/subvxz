WEBVTT

00:04.339 --> 00:09.072
Look at the size of this bad boy.
He put up quite a battle, too.

00:09.344 --> 00:13.610
It was him, then it was me,
then it was him, then it was me.

00:13.682 --> 00:16.116
Dad, you got him at the fish mart.

00:17.186 --> 00:19.484
Yeah, but you should've seen
the size of the lady

00:19.555 --> 00:21.182
that tried to take him from me.

00:21.256 --> 00:22.723
It was her, then it was me, then it was...

00:22.791 --> 00:25.385
All right, all right, Dad, I get it.

00:26.195 --> 00:29.961
So what's it gonna be, Bucky,
pan fried or barbecued?

00:30.032 --> 00:33.263
Dad, remember what we said
about naming the fish?

00:33.335 --> 00:34.529
What?

00:35.270 --> 00:38.706
It makes them a little harder to eat.

00:38.774 --> 00:41.504
Dad, I know I have mid-terms Monday,

00:41.610 --> 00:44.738
but the new Ashton Kutcher movie is
previewing tonight.

00:44.813 --> 00:48.977
How many "prettys" do I have to put
before "please" for you to let me go?

00:49.051 --> 00:52.418
- Well...
- Pretty, pretty, pretty,

00:52.855 --> 00:57.224
pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty please,
Dad, please.

00:57.292 --> 00:59.317
- Whoa!
- I can go?

00:59.394 --> 01:01.191
No, you can stop.

01:01.697 --> 01:05.758
- You know you gotta study.
- Yes, Dad, but if you think about it,

01:06.068 --> 01:07.899
mid-terms are halfway to finals,

01:07.970 --> 01:10.700
so I only need to study
about as half as hard.

01:10.773 --> 01:13.105
And since I study twice as hard
as everybody else,

01:13.175 --> 01:15.405
I only need to study a quarter.
So I'm done.

01:15.477 --> 01:17.274
See how that works?

01:18.046 --> 01:20.446
No, and you know what? I'm the dad.

01:20.516 --> 01:23.212
And you lose. See how that works?

01:23.285 --> 01:25.810
You see, little sister,
Dad, as a single parent,

01:25.888 --> 01:28.482
is just trying to make sure
that you have the proper guidance.

01:28.557 --> 01:32.186
And I, for one, commend him
on his commitment to education.

01:33.228 --> 01:34.957
Son, I'm glad you see it that way.

01:35.030 --> 01:39.865
Because I'm committing you to staying
home and studying this weekend, too.

01:40.836 --> 01:42.133
Ha, ha.

01:42.805 --> 01:45.638
- But my mid-terms were last week!
- Yeah, no kidding.

01:45.707 --> 01:48.267
I had to wrap the fish in something.
See?

01:48.343 --> 01:49.708
Minus.

01:57.386 --> 01:59.013
<i> Come on!</i>

01:59.087 --> 02:01.317
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:03.125 --> 02:06.686
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

02:06.762 --> 02:10.095
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:10.532 --> 02:14.628
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:15.637 --> 02:18.834
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:18.907 --> 02:24.174
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:24.246 --> 02:28.239
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:28.317 --> 02:30.251
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:30.319 --> 02:31.843
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:31.920 --> 02:35.822
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:36.325 --> 02:38.225
<i>Mix it all together</i>

02:38.293 --> 02:41.160
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

02:47.135 --> 02:50.263
I know, Dad, but what I'm saying is,

02:52.374 --> 02:54.342
who really needs history?

02:54.409 --> 02:58.675
It's so yesterday.
And I'm about the future!

02:58.747 --> 03:00.681
Yeah, and so am I.

03:00.749 --> 03:04.446
And right now I see you at 35,
living with me, no job,

03:04.519 --> 03:07.352
still stealing my change off the counter.

03:14.663 --> 03:19.464
This is a book. Go forth and learn.

03:20.569 --> 03:25.233
Remember my "ha, ha" from before?
I now add one more "ha,"

03:25.307 --> 03:29.334
making it a full, "ha, ha,"
wait for it, "ha. "

03:30.445 --> 03:31.673
Anybody seen my PDA?

03:31.747 --> 03:34.875
- Here.
- Thanks.

03:34.950 --> 03:39.410
Now, Dad, I know you already said no,
but I've been studying a lot since then.

03:39.655 --> 03:42.123
I sneezed a while ago
and algebra came out.

03:42.190 --> 03:44.522
Well, next time,
sneeze a little smart on your brother.

03:44.593 --> 03:46.823
He could use all the help he can get.

03:46.895 --> 03:49.625
I'm heading out for my meeting.
I should be back around 11:00.

03:49.698 --> 03:54.067
I'll be on my cell if anybody needs me,
so try not to need me.

03:55.737 --> 03:58.433
I don't know. You guys think
I'm being too tough on ya?

03:58.507 --> 04:00.031
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:00.409 --> 04:03.936
Good. Then that means
I'm doing my job right.

04:04.012 --> 04:05.502
Study hard now.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.241
<i> Pumpin' up the party now</i>

04:07.316 --> 04:12.845
<i>Hey, get up, get loud</i>

04:12.921 --> 04:14.718
<i>Pumpin' up the party now</i>

04:14.790 --> 04:20.456
<i>Hey, get up, get loud</i>

04:20.529 --> 04:22.963
<i>Pumpin' up the party now</i>

04:26.468 --> 04:32.236
<i>Hey, get up, get loud</i>

04:32.307 --> 04:34.275
<i>Pumpin' up the party now</i>

04:34.343 --> 04:39.940
<i>Hey, get up, get loud</i>

04:40.015 --> 04:42.142
<i>Pumpin' up the party now</i>

04:45.787 --> 04:49.120
- Wow. Eight minutes already.
- Yup.

04:49.558 --> 04:52.652
Time to turn in.
Good thing I'm not an outtie.

04:55.497 --> 04:59.297
- Cover him up, we've got company.
- She don't like me.

05:01.436 --> 05:03.063
So what's the deal?
Your dad say yes or no?

05:03.138 --> 05:04.503
Yeah, let's get those feet moving!

05:04.573 --> 05:06.404
My mom's in the car
grooving to the oldies,

05:06.475 --> 05:09.103
and it's getting uglier by the decade.

05:09.177 --> 05:11.042
Lilly, my dad said no.

05:11.113 --> 05:14.105
You think he said no, he really said go.

05:14.516 --> 05:17.917
No, go, it's a mistake
anybody could make. Come on.

05:17.986 --> 05:20.147
I just can't go.

05:20.856 --> 05:23.791
I heard Ashton Kutcher's
gonna be there.

05:24.626 --> 05:26.890
Okay, now you're just being cruel.

05:26.962 --> 05:30.056
But that's good.
It's working, keep going.

05:31.099 --> 05:37.504
Do it, do it. Ashton, do it.

05:37.572 --> 05:40.200
Just one more time.

05:40.275 --> 05:42.573
- Do it.
- Okay.

05:43.945 --> 05:47.142
Okay, now all we gotta do is sneak
you out without Jackson knowing.

05:47.215 --> 05:50.616
- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
- He'll never notice.

05:51.086 --> 05:53.350
He's got a friend over.

05:56.925 --> 05:57.949
Gotcha.

05:58.026 --> 06:00.392
- I didn't hear. Got what?
- Milk.

06:00.462 --> 06:03.590
I'll tell you in the car. Come on.
Well, gotta go.

06:03.665 --> 06:05.633
Straight home to drink some milk.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.725
- How am I doing?
- Shut up.

06:09.604 --> 06:13.040
Well, I'm just gonna go upstairs
and study.

06:13.275 --> 06:16.369
Well, I'm just gonna stay down here
and not care.

06:24.519 --> 06:26.646
Oh, yeah, big dawg.

06:27.856 --> 06:28.880
What's up, Cooper?

06:28.957 --> 06:32.484
Hey, check this out, J-Man,
I just found out that...

06:33.595 --> 06:34.823
Wait, hold on a sec.

06:34.896 --> 06:38.354
Theater three? I'm guessing
it's very close to theater two.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.958
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

06:41.036 --> 06:43.596
I swear people get dumber
and dumber every day.

06:43.672 --> 06:45.640
Hello! You're costing me minutes here!

06:45.707 --> 06:47.231
You gotta get down here.

06:47.309 --> 06:50.278
And I'm telling you this
on the DL, see...

06:50.345 --> 06:52.370
Keep the walker moving, lady.
If you were supposed to hear,

06:52.447 --> 06:54.608
it'd be on the speakerphone.

06:55.984 --> 06:57.212
There is a very hot rumor that

06:57.285 --> 06:59.776
Mr. Ashton Kutcher is dropping by
here tonight.

06:59.855 --> 07:01.584
And I should care about this because?

07:01.656 --> 07:03.920
Because this place is gonna be
crawling with fine ladies

07:03.992 --> 07:05.459
trying to get next to Ashton.

07:05.527 --> 07:06.858
And when they can't find him,

07:06.928 --> 07:09.226
- they'll settle for us! Oh, yes!
- They'll settle for us! Oh, yes!

07:09.297 --> 07:12.494
- Don't you feel me on this?
- I don't know, Coop.

07:13.135 --> 07:16.434
I mean, if I split,
Miley's just gonna tell my dad.

07:16.838 --> 07:20.831
Of course, she is in her room
for the rest of the night.

07:21.476 --> 07:25.071
And she's such a goody-goody,
little Miss Perfect,

07:25.147 --> 07:27.615
always kissing up to Dad.

07:27.682 --> 07:30.947
Just once in her life you'd think
she'd go out on a limb or something.

07:31.019 --> 07:33.010
But will she?
Mmm-mmm.

07:33.088 --> 07:36.785
Because she is gutless.
You know what?

07:39.027 --> 07:41.655
She won't even know that I'm gone.

07:41.730 --> 07:43.755
I just talked me into it!

07:48.537 --> 07:50.528
Cooper, you are a genius.

07:50.872 --> 07:52.305
It's like cheerleader tryouts.

07:52.374 --> 07:54.774
Right. Except we don't have to wear
those itchy man-sweaters

07:54.843 --> 07:58.404
or do the splits.
You know, I still can't ride a bike.

07:59.848 --> 08:01.975
The things we do for love.

08:02.184 --> 08:03.776
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

08:05.620 --> 08:08.214
Now, how to proceed is the question.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.185
Watch and learn.

08:13.428 --> 08:18.456
Hey, Ashton! Mr. Kutcher! My man!

08:19.267 --> 08:25.729
The Kutchinator! Kutchy kutchy you!
What's that, my close personal friend?

08:26.374 --> 08:31.505
Come to your party tonight? Sure.
I'll just find myself a little hottie,

08:31.613 --> 08:32.841
and we will party like it's...

08:36.351 --> 08:38.148
Hello? Hey, Barry.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.687
Can I maybe give you a call back?

08:39.754 --> 08:41.119
Ladies?

08:41.856 --> 08:43.015
Very smooth.

08:43.091 --> 08:46.060
You know, I was watching and learning,
and what I learned was

08:46.127 --> 08:48.357
that I should not have watched.

08:49.097 --> 08:51.725
All right, have a little patience, my man.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.995
It's just a minor set-back.

08:54.836 --> 08:57.134
Prepare to be impressed.

08:57.672 --> 09:03.975
So, Mr. Kutcher! The Kutchking!
Volcanic Ash!

09:07.349 --> 09:11.285
At this rate, I've got a better chance
with the lady with the walker.

09:11.353 --> 09:14.447
I bet she hasn't passed theater five yet.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.823
- What are you doing here?
- Me? What about you?

09:17.892 --> 09:19.052
- I'm telling Dad!
- I'm telling Dad!

09:19.127 --> 09:21.459
- No, you're not.
- No, you're not.

09:21.529 --> 09:24.054
Because we're not really here
right now.

09:24.132 --> 09:26.930
Right. But Dad is.

09:28.436 --> 09:29.425
Uh-oh!

09:35.810 --> 09:36.936
What can I say, Dad?

09:37.012 --> 09:41.415
She snuck out, I followed her here,
I'm just as disappointed as you are.

09:41.549 --> 09:44.017
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

09:44.085 --> 09:46.110
I'm getting ready to sell you out.

09:46.187 --> 09:49.623
Listen, buster, if I go down,
I'm taking you with me!

09:50.492 --> 09:53.586
What's he doing here?
He said he had a meeting.

09:56.331 --> 09:57.525
All right, just calm down.

09:57.599 --> 10:01.330
All we have to do is wait till he goes
in. He'll never know you were here.

10:01.403 --> 10:04.429
Lilly? Miley?

10:07.842 --> 10:10.208
- Miley's dad's here.
- Great.

10:13.481 --> 10:15.142
He doesn't know we're here.

10:15.216 --> 10:17.912
And we're gonna try to keep it that way.

10:21.056 --> 10:23.820
I don't think we're off to a good start.

10:30.565 --> 10:33.329
We have gotta get out of here.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.005
Wait, my bag.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:14.175 --> 11:16.735
- Don't answer it. Keep moving.
- I have to answer it.

11:16.811 --> 11:18.836
He thinks we're at home.

11:19.514 --> 11:23.211
- Hey, Dad! We're home!
- Studying at home.

11:23.284 --> 11:26.014
- Where we are, home...
- Sweet home!

11:26.087 --> 11:27.782
- Home!
- Home!

11:28.890 --> 11:30.653
Yeah, I just called
to check in on you guys

11:30.725 --> 11:32.590
and let you know that
whatever it is that you're doing

11:32.660 --> 11:34.025
that you don't want me
to know you're doing,

11:34.095 --> 11:37.690
stop doing it. Study hard now. Bye.

11:37.766 --> 11:39.859
I hate lying to him.

11:39.934 --> 11:41.868
You're on your hands and knees
in a movie theater!

11:41.936 --> 11:44.234
The honesty ship has sailed.

11:45.206 --> 11:48.573
I just can't figure out one thing.
Why are we hiding?

11:49.277 --> 11:54.977
Oliver, you naive, simple boy,
with a very good point! Best of luck.

11:57.819 --> 12:02.449
- Perfect. Can this night get any worse?
- Depends on how you feel about that.

12:06.995 --> 12:08.724
I don't believe it.

12:08.797 --> 12:12.494
I know. The old man
can get a date and I can't?

12:24.779 --> 12:26.804
Why would Dad do this?

12:26.881 --> 12:29.315
Why did he go on a date
and not tell us?

12:29.384 --> 12:30.874
I don't know.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.820
Please stop stuffing your face.

12:35.223 --> 12:39.455
- I'm eating away the pain.
- Doesn't this bother you?

12:40.628 --> 12:44.724
Miley, it's been three years.
He's probably lonely.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.589
Well, then we'll get him a puppy!

12:48.069 --> 12:49.161
I hear him!

12:49.237 --> 12:51.137
Look, just remember
that whatever happens

12:51.206 --> 12:53.697
he can't know we were there.
So just play it cool.

12:53.775 --> 12:56.608
I will, I will. He won't suspect a thing.

12:58.313 --> 13:02.511
Where have you been?
We agreed home by 11:00. And it's...

13:02.584 --> 13:06.816
- 11:03.
- Exactly! Three minutes of pure agony!

13:06.888 --> 13:12.383
Yes, but the important thing is that
while you were out, we weren't.

13:13.695 --> 13:19.656
Right. And you were at a meeting.
How did that go?

13:20.368 --> 13:22.734
- Fine.
- Fine?

13:22.804 --> 13:25.796
One syllable? That's all I get?

13:26.674 --> 13:28.938
Okay, it was really fine.

13:29.010 --> 13:31.478
Three syllables. Keep the change.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.811
Daddy, you're always talking about
how we don't share enough,

13:35.884 --> 13:37.146
and you're right.

13:37.218 --> 13:41.484
We should, starting now. You go first.

13:42.724 --> 13:46.956
Okay. It was a very productive meeting,
and who knows,

13:47.028 --> 13:50.589
in time it could amount to
a little som'n-som'n...

13:50.665 --> 13:53.896
- Like what-what?
- I don't know.

13:53.968 --> 13:56.994
You know how if you talk about things
too early it might jinx it.

13:57.071 --> 14:02.509
But don't worry, if it keeps going the
way it's going, I'll tell you all about it.

14:02.977 --> 14:05.741
- Love you guys. Good night.
- Good night, Dad.

14:05.813 --> 14:07.303
Love you, too.

14:08.850 --> 14:11.717
Well, great. This is terrible.
He's happy!

14:15.156 --> 14:17.317
I just wish I knew something about
this woman.

14:17.392 --> 14:20.884
What does she do for a living?
Does she have any kids? Any dogs?

14:20.962 --> 14:24.398
A sound-proof basement
where no one can hear our scream?

14:24.465 --> 14:26.194
I don't even know her name.

14:26.267 --> 14:28.167
- Margo Diamond.
- What?

14:28.236 --> 14:31.330
"Movie Saturday night.
Margo Diamond. "

14:32.173 --> 14:34.471
Hey, isn't she that real estate lady,
you know,

14:34.542 --> 14:36.806
the one on the bus bench
in front of the library?

14:36.878 --> 14:39.938
Your dad's dating
a homeless real estate lady?

14:40.481 --> 14:44.975
Wow, that's weird. She sells houses,
but she doesn't have one.

14:46.487 --> 14:49.422
I meant the ad on the bench,
Miss Einstein.

14:49.724 --> 14:51.954
This is perfect.
Now you can go meet her.

14:52.026 --> 14:53.391
Jackson can drive you.

14:53.461 --> 14:56.760
Let me paint you guys
a little picture here.

14:56.831 --> 14:58.526
"Hi, I'm Miley Stewart. "

14:59.934 --> 15:01.902
"And I'm her brother Jackson.

15:01.970 --> 15:03.699
"And we snuck out to the movies
last night

15:03.771 --> 15:06.069
"and saw that you were on a date
with our father.

15:06.140 --> 15:07.698
"Now why are we telling you this?

15:07.775 --> 15:10.403
"Out of some insane desire
to wanna get caught

15:10.478 --> 15:13.606
"and be grounded
for the rest of our natural lives!"

15:13.681 --> 15:16.616
Okay, how come you always get to be
the apple?

15:16.684 --> 15:19.847
Wait a minute.
Bellybutton boy makes sense.

15:20.955 --> 15:22.752
Okay, maybe you are right.

15:22.824 --> 15:26.658
Maybe we can't go down there
and talk to her.

15:26.728 --> 15:29.288
But I know somebody who can.

15:42.176 --> 15:44.906
This is the dumbest thing
I've ever done for you.

15:44.979 --> 15:48.005
This is the only thing
you've ever done for me.

15:48.082 --> 15:50.482
And don't pretend
you're not the least bit interested

15:50.551 --> 15:52.519
in our future possible step-mom.

15:52.587 --> 15:53.884
Well, of course I am.

15:53.955 --> 15:56.014
You're not the only one
who cares about Dad.

15:56.090 --> 15:58.217
I want him to be happy, too.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.884
And if she happens to have
a hot daughter

15:59.961 --> 16:04.591
who likes to invite her friends over
for pillow fights, well, everybody wins!

16:04.666 --> 16:07.362
Hello! Back to Earth, Captain Hormone.

16:07.969 --> 16:10.164
All right, let's do this.

16:10.872 --> 16:12.965
Just remember you're my chauffeur.

16:14.008 --> 16:16.499
Hi. I'm Hannah Montana,
and I'm looking for a house.

16:16.577 --> 16:19.307
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

16:20.048 --> 16:23.415
Lady, you're not gonna sell
many houses with that attitude.

16:23.484 --> 16:26.612
We'll talk later. Sorry. Telephone.

16:26.688 --> 16:31.182
Hi. What a thrill to meet you.
My niece is a big fan of yours.

16:31.259 --> 16:34.057
Really? Well, how old is she?
What does she look like,

16:34.128 --> 16:35.959
and do you happen to have
a picture of her?

16:36.030 --> 16:37.827
Not why we're here.

16:37.899 --> 16:39.594
But if we are going to be
in business together,

16:39.667 --> 16:41.692
I need to know
a little bit about you first.

16:41.769 --> 16:44.602
For example, who's this?
Your husband?

16:44.706 --> 16:48.335
- Does he know you're dating?
- Wait a minute. That's my brother.

16:48.409 --> 16:52.573
A likely story. Who keeps a picture
of their brother on their desk?

16:53.214 --> 16:55.079
He gave me a kidney.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.280
So you're scarred.

16:58.953 --> 17:02.616
You know, that's getting a little
personal. Can we just stick to houses?

17:02.690 --> 17:06.090
Certainly. What's yours like?
Any kids running around?

17:06.160 --> 17:08.390
Daughters who like pillow fights?

17:08.463 --> 17:13.332
You know, maybe I am not the right
person to be selling you a house.

17:13.534 --> 17:17.867
Let me put you in touch with Habib,
Prince of the West Side.

17:17.939 --> 17:20.999
- You're gonna love him.
- Hey, I'm not finished yet.

17:23.144 --> 17:25.476
On second thought, yes, I am.

17:25.980 --> 17:27.777
Ms. Diamond,
excuse me and my chauffeur.

17:27.848 --> 17:29.043
We have to confer in private.

17:29.117 --> 17:32.848
And I must insist that you let
no one know that I was here!

17:33.855 --> 17:37.689
Absolutely.
I'm trying to forget about it myself.

17:40.495 --> 17:44.727
"I don't know what to say, Dad.
It was her idea. I tried to stop her.

17:45.032 --> 17:48.126
"I'm just as disappointed as you are. "

17:48.202 --> 17:51.603
I am amazed that you can stand
without a spine.

17:52.073 --> 17:54.371
Hi. I brought you these.

17:55.877 --> 17:59.643
I think we can spend
a little more money than that!

17:59.714 --> 18:02.911
I don't think that's hardly fair,
I mean, there was the movie last night,

18:02.984 --> 18:04.349
popcorn, you wanted the big drink.

18:04.418 --> 18:08.514
No, no! I'm on the phone.
They're lovely. Thank you.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.819
Yeah, yeah, Habib,
let me call you back.

18:10.892 --> 18:12.826
Jackson, you're on my foot!

18:12.894 --> 18:17.854
I can't move. I've got a "For Sale" sign
in my backyard.

18:19.834 --> 18:22.803
- I had a nice time last night.
- So did I.

18:22.870 --> 18:24.997
Man, he really likes her.

18:27.241 --> 18:30.074
You know, Miles,
she does seem pretty nice.

18:30.611 --> 18:34.980
I don't care how nice she is. She ain't
ever getting any of my kidneys!

18:35.049 --> 18:39.611
I would love to go out for coffee. Let me
just get someone to cover for me.

18:39.921 --> 18:41.411
You're not gonna believe this,

18:41.489 --> 18:44.720
but I have got Hannah Montana
hiding in my closet.

18:45.126 --> 18:46.115
Huh?

18:46.661 --> 18:52.395
Yeah, she's what we call a half bath
short of a condo. I blame the parents.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.461
- Yeah, me too.
- Let me get my coat.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.272
All right, come on out. Now.

19:06.113 --> 19:09.947
Dad, what a relief.
You'd never believe how lost I was.

19:11.319 --> 19:14.447
Would it help if I said
I was happy for you?

19:15.223 --> 19:17.123
How could you?

19:17.892 --> 19:20.360
Whoa, now hold up, little girl.

19:21.762 --> 19:23.286
How'd you find out?

19:23.364 --> 19:25.889
- Well, you didn't tell me.
- I can explain.

19:25.967 --> 19:30.267
Okay, explain this. Why are you dating
someone without telling me?

19:30.605 --> 19:32.903
Explain how you could ever think that
there's someone out there

19:32.974 --> 19:35.272
who could ever replace my mom.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.576
That was awkward.

19:49.590 --> 19:52.184
<i>I miss you</i>

19:52.260 --> 19:54.592
<i>I miss your smile</i>

19:55.229 --> 19:59.791
<i>And I still shed a tear</i>
<i>every once in a while</i>

19:59.901 --> 20:02.597
<i>And even though it's different now</i>

20:02.737 --> 20:05.501
<i>You're still here somehow</i>

20:05.573 --> 20:08.201
<i>My heart won't let you go</i>

20:08.709 --> 20:11.371
<i>And I need you to know</i>

20:11.445 --> 20:13.936
<i>I miss you</i>

20:16.817 --> 20:18.785
<i>I miss you</i>

20:20.788 --> 20:23.018
That's a beautiful song, honey.

20:29.096 --> 20:31.462
I like coming out here at night.

20:33.134 --> 20:36.262
It's a good place to try
and figure things out.

20:38.472 --> 20:41.373
Maybe we could
figure things out together.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.836
Why didn't you tell me?

20:44.512 --> 20:48.209
I guess I was hoping to tell you
at just the right time

20:48.282 --> 20:51.183
and just the right way,
so you'd understand

20:51.852 --> 20:54.844
and not end up out here on the deck
all alone.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.351
I guess there was no right time,
was there?

20:59.427 --> 21:02.919
I just can't picture you
with anybody else but Mom.

21:02.997 --> 21:04.726
Neither can I.

21:06.067 --> 21:10.265
What she and I had was special.
I can't replace that.

21:11.238 --> 21:14.571
- Then why are you dating?
- Because life goes on,

21:15.743 --> 21:19.372
and we gotta try and figure out
some way to go on with it.

21:20.414 --> 21:23.781
Don't you think your mom
would've wanted that for us?

21:24.018 --> 21:27.749
Yeah, I guess she would've.

21:28.422 --> 21:30.720
She was pretty smart that way.

21:33.027 --> 21:36.258
- I really miss her, Daddy.
- I miss her too, kiddo.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.834
What's this rope ladder doing here?

21:49.643 --> 21:52.703
Dad, let's not ruin
the beautiful moment.

21:54.482 --> 21:57.144
You're right. I'll ruin it tomorrow.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.427
So what do you wanna do?

22:07.495 --> 22:10.157
Oh, I don't know.
What do you wanna do?

22:10.765 --> 22:14.292
Can you believe that we don't have
dates on a Saturday night?

22:14.368 --> 22:17.360
If only they knew
what they were missing.

22:18.172 --> 22:20.606
Sorry I ever taught you that, Son.

22:21.305 --> 22:27.466
