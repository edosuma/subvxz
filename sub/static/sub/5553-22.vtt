WEBVTT

00:02.342 --> 00:04.542
Oh, hey, if you guys
are free this weekend,

00:04.544 --> 00:06.378
I won a night of
wine tasting from work.

00:06.380 --> 00:07.879
That sounds fun.
Mm-hmm.

00:07.881 --> 00:11.282
How come scientists don't win
free stuff like salespeople do?

00:11.284 --> 00:12.951
'Cause we're not in it
for the stuff.

00:12.953 --> 00:15.654
We're in it
for the groupies.

00:15.656 --> 00:16.921
Personally,

00:16.923 --> 00:19.724
I find the notion of
external rewards demeaning.

00:19.726 --> 00:23.028
I pursue science for the
intrinsic joy of discovery.

00:23.030 --> 00:25.930
But you always say that
you want to win a Nobel Prize.

00:25.932 --> 00:28.400
I also say don't contradict
me in front of my friends,

00:28.402 --> 00:29.668
but that you
don't remember.

00:29.670 --> 00:32.737
All right, well, let me know
if you guys want to go.

00:32.738 --> 00:33.938
I would love to.

00:33.940 --> 00:37.075
I do enjoy the complexity
of an aged Pinot noir.

00:37.077 --> 00:38.376
I'm sure that would pair nicely

00:38.378 --> 00:40.311
with your fried nuggets
of chicken.

00:42.082 --> 00:44.182
Well, it sounds like
a nice night. We should go.

00:44.184 --> 00:45.250
Wine again?

00:45.252 --> 00:46.484
Yeah, no, thank you.

00:46.486 --> 00:48.386
I like my grapes
the old-fashioned way:

00:48.388 --> 00:50.722
in a juice box.

00:50.724 --> 00:52.090
Well, I'm going.

00:52.092 --> 00:54.092
You couldn't stop me from
getting a massage at the mall,

00:54.094 --> 00:55.760
and you're not stopping me now.

00:55.762 --> 00:57.529
I shouldn't have to
see my girlfriend

00:57.531 --> 00:59.364
get groped in public
by another man.

00:59.366 --> 01:01.933
And I shouldn't
have to see my boyfriend

01:01.935 --> 01:04.569
riding on a train for children
around the mall.

01:06.173 --> 01:08.173
The little choo-choo
for toddlers?

01:08.175 --> 01:10.241
And now you know why
I needed the massage.

01:11.812 --> 01:13.011
Well, we're out.

01:13.013 --> 01:14.813
Bernie can't drink
'cause she's pregnant.

01:14.815 --> 01:16.748
And she's pregnant
because we had sex.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.183
And we had sex because...

01:18.185 --> 01:20.919
well, come on.

01:21.955 --> 01:23.988
It's okay.
You should go.

01:23.990 --> 01:24.956
You sure?

01:24.958 --> 01:26.157
Of course.

01:26.159 --> 01:29.928
Yeah, give her a break from,
“Well, come on.”

01:31.431 --> 01:33.798
Well, Bernadette, looks like
Saturday night, it's you and me.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.601
Me? How? Why?

01:36.603 --> 01:38.269
Well, it makes perfect sense.

01:38.271 --> 01:41.072
Because you're an expectant
mother, you can't drink alcohol.

01:41.074 --> 01:42.040
I don't like to.

01:42.042 --> 01:43.408
You can't have sushi.

01:43.410 --> 01:44.375
I don't like to.

01:44.377 --> 01:46.010
You can't go in hot tubs.

01:46.012 --> 01:49.180
I consider them
vats of sweaty people soup.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.050
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.

01:52.052 --> 01:53.451
Oh, come on.

01:53.453 --> 01:55.954
Roller coasters, caffeine,
runny eggs--

01:55.956 --> 01:57.789
I've been avoiding these things
all my life.

01:57.791 --> 02:01.059
And now, because you're
pregnant, you have to.

02:01.061 --> 02:03.194
The difference is she's
bringing life into the world,

02:03.196 --> 02:05.130
and you suck it out.

02:05.966 --> 02:07.932
I guess we could give it a try.

02:07.934 --> 02:10.502
Well, little lady,
you've heard of party hearty;

02:10.503 --> 02:13.104
get ready to party hardly.

02:14.341 --> 02:16.975
I bet you'd like
a drink right now.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.869
Hey, you think
it'd be okay

02:49.871 --> 02:51.504
if I brought Claire
to the wine tasting?

02:51.506 --> 02:53.305
Sure. I'd like to meet her.
Oh, that's great.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.974
I've been wanting her
to meet you guys, too,

02:54.976 --> 02:56.609
so this seems like
the perfect opportunity.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.110
Oh, but I won't be there.

02:58.112 --> 02:59.445
Funny how that worked out.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.449
Does this mean Emily's not
in the picture anymore?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.517
No, I'm still dating her.

03:04.519 --> 03:05.685
Okay, help me out.

03:05.687 --> 03:07.019
How are you doing this?

03:07.021 --> 03:08.854
Do they know about each other?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.589
They know that
we're not exclusive,

03:10.591 --> 03:12.725
and we just don't ask
too many questions.

03:12.727 --> 03:15.361
You know, it's like how I play
Warlords of Ka'a with you

03:15.363 --> 03:19.131
and Elder Sign with
Frank and Alicia.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.701
Who's Frank and Alicia?

03:21.703 --> 03:24.136
Y... You and I spend
a lot of time together.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.739
Can there be a little
mystery between us?

03:26.741 --> 03:28.507
Okay.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.276
Everything's hooked up.
We're ready.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.212
I am going to record
this for posterity.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.914
All right, here goes nothing.

03:34.916 --> 03:36.282
Here goes nothing?

03:36.284 --> 03:37.917
This is the initial test
of our prototype.

03:37.919 --> 03:39.518
Can we give it
a little more gravitas?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.686
Fine.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.489
Preliminary trial
of the infinite persistence

03:43.491 --> 03:46.559
gyroscopic navigational system:
phase one commencing.

03:46.561 --> 03:47.927
Eh... maybe it's your voice.

03:47.929 --> 03:50.763
I'm gonna see if I can get James
Earl Jones to do it in post.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.969
Ooh.

03:58.773 --> 04:00.473
Wow.

04:00.475 --> 04:03.109
It's... it's-it's beautiful.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.346
Actually,
it's making me dizzy.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.049
Good, it's not just me.

04:15.223 --> 04:16.387
Hello.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.423
Hey, Claire.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.390
Hey, what's up?

04:18.392 --> 04:19.125
Hi, yeah.

04:19.127 --> 04:20.625
Um, I was wondering,

04:20.628 --> 04:22.795
if you're free Saturday night,

04:22.797 --> 04:25.097
all my friends are
going to a wine tasting.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.500
Sure, I guess.

04:27.502 --> 04:30.169
If you don't think meeting
your friends is too big a step.

04:30.171 --> 04:32.705
Why would it be too big a step?

04:32.707 --> 04:35.875
I don't know. I just don't
want things to get weird.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.944
Nothing to worry about.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.379
People meet people all the time,

04:40.381 --> 04:41.847
and it isn't weird.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.383
I met Bon Jovi once, which
you'd think might be weird.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.353
Turns out, total sweetheart.

04:47.355 --> 04:51.524
Okay, but you and I have been
keeping things casual.

04:51.526 --> 04:53.559
Uh, will you introduce me
as your friend

04:53.561 --> 04:54.727
or as your girlfriend?

04:54.729 --> 04:56.295
What if I like them

04:56.297 --> 04:57.429
and they don't like me?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.532
What if they like me
and I don't like them?

04:59.534 --> 05:02.368
Boy, it wasn't this hard
with Bon Jovi.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.403
I said, “You rock,”
he said, “Thanks, man,”

05:04.405 --> 05:07.273
and that was that.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.015
Hey, you ready to go?

05:16.017 --> 05:17.950
Hang on.
What are you doing?

05:17.952 --> 05:21.787
Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff
book about wine tasting.

05:22.824 --> 05:24.957
It teaches the different
flavor notes to look for.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.559
You actually smell the wine?

05:26.561 --> 05:29.128
I mostly just smell
my nasal spray.

05:29.130 --> 05:31.197
Are your sinuses acting up?

05:31.199 --> 05:32.898
Since my preschool got a bunny.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.935
Hey, are you still hanging out
with Bernadette tonight?

05:35.937 --> 05:37.269
Yes.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.305
And we're going to prove
that we don't need alcohol

05:39.307 --> 05:40.339
to enjoy ourselves.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.674
Oh, good for you.

05:41.676 --> 05:43.609
Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi,

05:43.611 --> 05:46.278
soft cheese, processed meats
and Jacuzzis,

05:46.280 --> 05:48.881
which can all be harmful
to an unborn baby.

05:48.883 --> 05:52.351
No HoneyBaked Ham
in a hot tub-- got it.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.686
Oh, no bubble baths either.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.821
They can increase the risk
of a urinary tract infection.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.089
Okay, have fun.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.992
Oh, and no swordfish, king
mackerel, shark or tilefish,

05:59.994 --> 06:01.527
which are all high in mercury.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.661
We're leaving now!

06:02.663 --> 06:03.863
Oh, and no contact with
guinea pigs

06:03.865 --> 06:05.164
or hamsters or their droppings,

06:05.166 --> 06:08.467
uh, no-no cat litter boxes,
no paint fumes...

06:08.469 --> 06:10.970
Okay, we're leaving,
love you, bye!

06:12.240 --> 06:14.840
Boy, do I love restrictions.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.477
Hey.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.511
Where is everybody?

06:19.513 --> 06:21.146
Oh, we're the first ones here.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.915
Oh.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.017
Cool.

06:25.019 --> 06:26.785
Yeah.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.220
Cool.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.028
You know, I don't
remember the last time

06:36.030 --> 06:37.796
it was just you and me
hanging out.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.766
Oh, I do.
It was three years ago.

06:40.768 --> 06:44.203
Oh, yeah, and we said
we should do it more often.

06:44.205 --> 06:46.939
And-and here we are.

06:54.649 --> 06:56.682
So, Sheldon and Bernadette
are hanging out.

06:56.684 --> 07:00.052
I know. What are they
gonna talk about?

07:01.522 --> 07:03.622
I don't know.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.992
I really don't know.

07:06.994 --> 07:07.927
Hey.

07:07.929 --> 07:09.495
Oh, good!
Oh, thank God!

07:09.497 --> 07:11.764
You guys been here long?

07:11.766 --> 07:12.798
No, two minutes.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.601
But yes.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.635
Where's Claire?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.070
Oh, she's meeting us here.

07:18.072 --> 07:20.339
Hey, guys, do me a favor
and don't ask too many questions

07:20.341 --> 07:21.307
about the relationship.

07:21.309 --> 07:22.875
We're just keeping it casual.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.611
Oh, so I shouldn't ask her
how she feels about being

07:25.613 --> 07:27.780
a member of your harem?

07:27.782 --> 07:30.849
Yeah, I know you're teasing,
but watch out for karma.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.585
Hey, Penny, isn't that
your old boyfriend Zack?

07:33.587 --> 07:35.654
Oh, yeah.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.122
Are you gonna
say hi to him?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.257
Uh, I don't know.

07:38.259 --> 07:39.258
Hey, while you decide,

07:39.260 --> 07:40.526
who was better in bed:

07:40.528 --> 07:43.963
big hot Zack
or wheezy little Leonard?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.101
Neener neener.

07:50.271 --> 07:51.870
I brought sparkling cider.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.074
Oh... the bubbles
tickle my nose.

07:55.076 --> 07:57.509
I'll just open this now
so it can get

07:57.511 --> 08:00.112
nice and flat
before we drink it.

08:00.114 --> 08:02.114
So what do you want
to do tonight?

08:02.116 --> 08:04.350
Oh, I have quite
the evening planned.

08:04.352 --> 08:07.653
Our fetus-friendly
festival of fun begins

08:07.655 --> 08:08.954
with an in-depth look

08:08.956 --> 08:10.889
at the world of model trains,

08:10.891 --> 08:13.192
and then we'll kick things
up a notch and explore

08:13.194 --> 08:16.328
all the different ways
that you can make toast.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.297
There's more than one?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.133
You've heard of French toast?
Yeah.

08:21.135 --> 08:22.401
Cinnamon toast?
Yeah.

08:22.403 --> 08:23.635
Melba toast?
Yeah.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.871
You get where I'm going here?

08:25.873 --> 08:28.374
Yeah.

08:30.478 --> 08:33.312
I'm getting
an earthy note.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.246
Ah, there's
definitely some oak.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.515
Also, uh, cherries?

08:37.518 --> 08:39.451
I smell nothing.

08:40.755 --> 08:43.022
Really? Nothing?

08:43.024 --> 08:46.625
Just a... whole lot of Afrin.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.360
Penny?

08:48.362 --> 08:49.595
Oh. Zack, hi!

08:49.597 --> 08:50.863
You guys remember Zack.

08:50.865 --> 08:51.997
Yeah, hey, buddy.
- Hello. - Hey.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.866
Hey, did you two
get married?

08:53.868 --> 08:55.167
We did.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

08:55.169 --> 08:57.403
To each other?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.105
Yes.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.307
Cool. 'Cause other than
when you broke up with him

09:02.309 --> 09:04.009
and dated me, then
broke up with me,

09:04.011 --> 09:06.945
and then dated me one more
time before going back to him,

09:06.947 --> 09:08.914
I was always rooting
for you two.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.549
Thanks.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.051
So how's the
science world?

09:12.053 --> 09:13.485
What are you
guys up to?

09:13.487 --> 09:15.888
W-We've actually been
working on a prototype

09:15.890 --> 09:17.423
for a navigation
system we invented.

09:17.425 --> 09:19.224
But we won't bore you
with the details.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.393
Are you kidding?
I love science.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.997
Einstein, Stephen Hawking,
Mike deGrasse Tyson.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.000
Mike deGrasse Tyson?

09:28.002 --> 09:30.702
Yeah, you know,
the boxer who grew a mustache

09:30.704 --> 09:33.305
and became a scientist.

09:33.307 --> 09:34.573
So what's your
invention?

09:34.575 --> 09:37.776
Well, we're using
quantum vortices

09:37.778 --> 09:39.978
to replace gyroscopes
in guidance systems.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.680
What's neat is
that they can maintain

09:41.682 --> 09:43.348
angular momentum indefinitely.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.551
Angular momentum.

09:45.553 --> 09:48.020
I was wondering about that.

09:48.022 --> 09:51.790
You could put it in a
satellite or a rocket,

09:51.792 --> 09:53.559
and it'll run forever.

09:53.561 --> 09:54.827
Cool.

09:54.829 --> 09:57.196
Could it be used for
missiles and war stuff?

09:57.198 --> 10:00.432
Yeah, but we didn't
create it for weapons.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.434
And I doubt the military
would be interested

10:02.436 --> 10:03.802
in our little
guidance system.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.404
Is it better than
the one they use now?

10:05.406 --> 10:08.207
A lot!
Way better.

10:08.209 --> 10:09.942
Huh.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.478
You sure you guys are smart?

10:14.000 --> 10:20.074

10:21.118 --> 10:24.586
“H-O” gauge trains
are 1/87 scale.

10:24.588 --> 10:27.789
“N” gauge are
1/160 scale.

10:27.791 --> 10:30.459
And that brings us
to “Z” gauge, at a

10:30.461 --> 10:35.264
“you could easily swallow it,
don't ask how I know,” 1/220.

10:35.266 --> 10:37.432
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

10:37.434 --> 10:40.569
When I was five, I ingested
a “Z” gauge locomotive.

10:40.571 --> 10:43.005
I spent the next three days
saying, “I think I can pass it,

10:43.007 --> 10:46.742
I think I can pass it,
I think I can pass it.”

10:48.212 --> 10:50.979
What is it about trains
that you like so much?

10:50.981 --> 10:53.148
What an interesting
question.

10:53.150 --> 10:56.118
When I was a child,
life was confusing

10:56.120 --> 10:59.121
and chaotic for me, and
trains represented order.

10:59.123 --> 11:03.158
I could line them up,
categorize them, control them.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.660
I guess you
could say that

11:04.662 --> 11:08.096
they gave me a sense of calm
in a world that didn't.

11:08.098 --> 11:10.165
That's lovely, Sheldon.

11:10.167 --> 11:12.868
Well... other than when they're
chugging through your bowels,

11:12.870 --> 11:14.703
these things are magic.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.675
I have to admit,
I've been worried about

11:19.677 --> 11:22.678
the military applications since
we started talking about this.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.046
Me, too.

11:24.048 --> 11:25.380
Why didn't you
say something?

11:25.382 --> 11:27.816
Same reason I don't
talk about ass cancer.

11:27.818 --> 11:30.786
It's not a
pleasant topic.

11:30.788 --> 11:32.354
You can't let this stop you.

11:32.356 --> 11:34.389
Almost any scientific
advancement can be used

11:34.391 --> 11:36.091
for destructive purposes.

11:36.093 --> 11:38.126
It's true. Even Einstein's
theory of relativity

11:38.128 --> 11:40.796
was later applied to the
development of nuclear weapons.

11:40.798 --> 11:42.631
E equals MC squared.

11:42.633 --> 11:43.999
Yeah.

11:44.001 --> 11:45.334
“E” is for energy,
“M” for mass,

11:45.336 --> 11:46.768
and “C” for the speed of light.

11:48.939 --> 11:50.505
How do you know that?

11:50.507 --> 11:54.109
Oh, Leonard mumbles it when
he wants sex to last longer.

11:57.214 --> 11:58.180
Hey, Raj.

11:58.182 --> 12:00.248
Hey, Claire.
Good, you're here.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.117
Guys, this is
my friend Claire.

12:02.119 --> 12:04.319
We're casually dating,
and there's no need

12:04.321 --> 12:06.755
for any further questions
about it.

12:07.524 --> 12:09.825
Would you like
a glass of wine?

12:09.827 --> 12:11.593
I said no questions!

12:13.697 --> 12:15.931
And last
but not least,

12:15.933 --> 12:19.935
this is one that I like to call
Star Wars Toast because...

12:19.937 --> 12:24.272
it has a light side
and a dark side.

12:26.977 --> 12:29.277
All righty, it's time for
Dungeons & Dragons!

12:29.279 --> 12:31.647
Dungeons & Dragons.

12:31.649 --> 12:32.981
That sounds about right.

12:32.983 --> 12:35.517
You're gonna
enjoy this.

12:35.519 --> 12:38.253
I designed it
especially for you.

12:38.255 --> 12:39.888
Okay, but just for a little bit.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.590
Oh, I have a feeling
that once you start,

12:41.592 --> 12:44.393
you're not gonna want to
or be allowed to stop.

12:44.395 --> 12:47.229
All right.

12:47.231 --> 12:48.230
Ready?

12:48.232 --> 12:49.998
You bet.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.633
Your name is

12:51.635 --> 12:52.734
Bernatrix.

12:52.736 --> 12:54.036
You are a warrior queen.

12:54.038 --> 12:56.905
You're strong,
beautiful and tall.

12:56.907 --> 13:00.709
Oh. I like the idea
of being tall.

13:00.711 --> 13:03.145
I think you're gonna like
a lot of things I have in store.

13:03.147 --> 13:05.747
For example, in this world,
only the men get pregnant,

13:05.749 --> 13:10.485
so your husband is home trying
not to pee when he laughs.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.454
This is getting fun.
What's next?

13:12.456 --> 13:14.623
You're parched and weary
from battle.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.893
You stand in front of a tavern
that serves the coldest,

13:17.895 --> 13:20.195
most delicious ale
in all the realm.

13:20.197 --> 13:22.564
Oh, I haven't had
a drink in months.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.299
What do you do?

13:24.301 --> 13:27.302
I storm in, slam my sword down,

13:27.304 --> 13:29.838
and say, “Barkeep, bring me
the strongest ale you have

13:29.840 --> 13:32.174
and serve it in
the skull of a goblin!”

13:35.112 --> 13:37.679
He wants to see I.D.

13:40.384 --> 13:43.552
So, Claire, we've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

13:43.554 --> 13:46.054
Really? Like what?

13:48.092 --> 13:50.358
Uh, mostly Penny's
heard them.

13:52.196 --> 13:54.930
Boy, you get some
dirty looks over there

13:54.932 --> 13:56.965
when you ask for ice.

13:57.735 --> 14:00.335
Zack, this is
my friend Claire.

14:00.337 --> 14:02.838
You're hot. You seeing anybody?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.940
Uh, she's seeing me.

14:04.942 --> 14:06.174
Why'd you say she's your friend?

14:06.176 --> 14:07.409
We're just
keeping it casual.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.644
Why is he being casual with you?
You seem great.

14:09.646 --> 14:11.046
I don't know. Ask him.

14:11.048 --> 14:13.415
Why are you being casual
with her? She seems great.

14:21.358 --> 14:23.725
Maybe we should
take a step back.

14:23.727 --> 14:25.260
Take a step back?

14:25.262 --> 14:27.362
I'm not a young man anymore.

14:28.766 --> 14:32.267
No, I mean reevaluate what we're
doing with the guidance system.

14:32.269 --> 14:34.836
But I got a baby
on the way.

14:34.838 --> 14:36.404
I got to make some money.

14:36.406 --> 14:37.939
What good is
money gonna do

14:37.941 --> 14:39.641
if we inadvertently
bring about Armageddon?

14:39.643 --> 14:41.409
Okay, let me stop you
right there.

14:41.411 --> 14:42.644
We absolutely know

14:42.646 --> 14:45.747
our invention will not be used
to destroy the world.

14:45.749 --> 14:46.815
How?

14:46.817 --> 14:48.183
Because no one from the future

14:48.185 --> 14:50.318
has come back to kill us.

14:52.156 --> 14:53.522
Very funny.

14:53.524 --> 14:54.956
You got something better?

14:54.958 --> 14:56.291
Well, not really.

14:56.293 --> 14:57.893
Okay, then.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.066
Geez, how much wine
did you drink?

15:05.068 --> 15:08.804
Not a lot. I just couldn't
start until you walked away.

15:12.176 --> 15:14.876
The Hell Prawn lunges
out of the hot spring!

15:15.879 --> 15:18.180
You block it with your shield.

15:18.182 --> 15:19.181
Do you attack?

15:19.183 --> 15:20.315
Does it have eyes?

15:20.317 --> 15:22.851
Three giant red ones
and they never blink.

15:22.853 --> 15:24.486
It's unsettling.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.022
I stab it in the middle eye!

15:28.325 --> 15:29.324
Good choice!

15:29.326 --> 15:30.926
Critical hit!
Your sword goes

15:30.928 --> 15:33.094
through its eye
into its tiny brain.

15:33.096 --> 15:35.397
With its final dying gasp,
it says,

15:35.399 --> 15:36.932
“You have reduced me

15:36.934 --> 15:38.867
“to a pile of sushi.

15:38.869 --> 15:40.535
“Enjoy me

15:40.537 --> 15:43.471
“with this packet of soy sauce.

15:43.473 --> 15:46.141
It's low sodium.”

15:47.845 --> 15:49.911
Okay, I guess I should
eat the Hell Prawn.

15:49.913 --> 15:50.879
Using your sword,

15:50.881 --> 15:53.181
you prepare a beautiful
sushi dinner.

15:53.183 --> 15:56.351
You slip into the hot spring
and enjoy the warm water

15:56.353 --> 15:57.485
on your aching joints.

15:57.487 --> 15:58.753
As you happily
close your eyes,

15:58.755 --> 16:01.056
you recall the incredible
evening you've had

16:01.058 --> 16:02.490
and notice that your...

16:03.894 --> 16:08.263
...feet and ankles are
smaller than they've ever been.

16:08.265 --> 16:09.931
The end.

16:09.933 --> 16:13.702
Wow, this night turned out to be
so much more fun than I thought.

16:13.704 --> 16:15.036
Oh, the fun doesn't stop.

16:15.038 --> 16:17.505
You're still going home
with a goodie bag full of toast.

16:20.777 --> 16:22.477
Thank you for this.

16:22.479 --> 16:25.180
You know, ever since people
found out I'm having a baby,

16:25.182 --> 16:27.983
I feel like I became
Pregnant Bernadette.

16:27.985 --> 16:30.118
It was nice to take
a little break tonight.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.254
I can understand that.

16:32.256 --> 16:34.623
From the moment
people realized I was a genius,

16:34.625 --> 16:36.424
I've been Sheldon the Genius.

16:38.328 --> 16:40.161
Although I've never really
wanted a break from that,

16:40.163 --> 16:41.796
so I suppose I don't understand.

16:41.798 --> 16:43.531
Which is ironic

16:43.533 --> 16:45.533
'cause, you know, genius.

16:47.738 --> 16:49.537
Well, thanks again.

16:49.539 --> 16:50.639
You're welcome.

16:50.641 --> 16:52.073
And any time you need a break

16:52.075 --> 16:53.475
from being
Bernadette the Pregnant,

16:53.477 --> 16:55.677
Bernatrix the Warrior Queen
is here waiting.

16:55.679 --> 16:57.646
I might just take
you up on that.

16:57.648 --> 16:58.980
Well, mind you now,

16:58.982 --> 17:01.416
that offer's only good
until the third trimester.

17:01.418 --> 17:05.153
I can't risk getting
amniotic fluid on my spot.

17:07.257 --> 17:10.692
Hey, dude, you're
killing me with Claire.

17:10.694 --> 17:11.760
What are you talking about?

17:11.762 --> 17:14.329
I mean,
come on, look at you.

17:14.330 --> 17:17.365
You're classically handsome,
you've got a swimmer's body.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.568
Next to you,
I look like me.

17:20.569 --> 17:23.637
Oh, man,
I didn't mean to do that.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.675
But I do appreciate you
recognizing my swimmer's body.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.910
Which, incidentally,

17:28.912 --> 17:31.980
I got from playing
Marco Polo at the YMCA.

17:34.017 --> 17:36.751
Yeah, okay, just...
do me a favor

17:36.753 --> 17:39.554
and stop talking about
how great Claire is.

17:39.556 --> 17:42.724
Anything for you,
my little foreign friend.

17:43.961 --> 17:45.360
So, I got to ask,

17:45.362 --> 17:47.429
does Raj bring around
other girls?

17:48.298 --> 17:49.798
Uh, you know,

17:49.800 --> 17:52.000
I-I'm not really
around that much.

17:52.002 --> 17:54.035
Amy knows much more
than I do.

17:55.439 --> 17:57.172
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

17:57.174 --> 17:59.841
Raj is a terrific guy,
loyal to a fault.

17:59.843 --> 18:03.011
Yeah. He still has
an AOL address.

18:04.381 --> 18:05.914
I see what you're saying.

18:05.916 --> 18:08.917
She's not so great.

18:12.756 --> 18:14.656
Don't listen to him.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.524
He says crazy things
all the time.

18:16.526 --> 18:17.525
Uh, watch. Marco.

18:17.527 --> 18:19.260
Polo!

18:21.164 --> 18:24.299
So, uh, what are
you guys talking about?

18:24.301 --> 18:26.267
Your friends were
just telling me about

18:26.269 --> 18:27.869
all the other girls
you're dating.

18:27.871 --> 18:30.305
Why would you do that?

18:30.307 --> 18:32.974
I specifically asked you
not to do that.

18:32.976 --> 18:34.242
We didn't.

18:34.244 --> 18:35.510
You just did.

18:38.048 --> 18:41.549
Wow. Maybe none of
you guys are smart.

18:51.759 --> 18:53.825
Morning.

18:53.827 --> 18:55.026
Morning.

18:55.028 --> 18:57.060
Ugh. Too much wine.

18:57.061 --> 18:58.327
Oh, I overdid it

18:58.329 --> 18:59.628
myself last night.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.263
Hair of the dog.

19:02.867 --> 19:06.001
Hey, did you ever think about
the military applications

19:06.003 --> 19:07.570
for the guidance system?

19:07.572 --> 19:09.338
Of course.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.673
Does it bother you?

19:11.509 --> 19:13.309
No, it did at first,

19:13.311 --> 19:16.879
but then I talked it through
with Frank and Alicia, and...

19:19.684 --> 19:22.852
...they really helped
put things into perspective.

19:22.854 --> 19:25.688
Who are these people?

19:25.690 --> 19:30.626
Leonard, friends are
like toilet paper.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.596
It's good to have extras
under the sink.
