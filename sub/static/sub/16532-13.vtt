WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.250
Okay.

00:04.668 --> 00:06.226
Screwdriver?

00:09.719 --> 00:10.961
Oh, no.

00:12.164 --> 00:13.889
Backup screwdriver.

00:14.547 --> 00:17.624
I come from a long line of handy men.

00:17.649 --> 00:19.477
My dad used to fix everything...

00:19.502 --> 00:21.670
lawnmowers, cars, our cat.

00:21.695 --> 00:23.585
So it made sense that I
tackled the clothes dryer

00:23.610 --> 00:25.910
after the repair guy
tried to rip me off.

00:25.978 --> 00:27.654
I'm not paying $350

00:27.679 --> 00:30.069
for a moisture sensor that costs $28.

00:30.094 --> 00:31.293
I'll fix it myself.

00:31.318 --> 00:32.759
It's a complicated job.

00:32.784 --> 00:34.929
- You know what I did back in Russia?
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:34.954 --> 00:37.176
You were a doctor or a scientist.

00:37.201 --> 00:38.509
- I fixed dryers.
- Oh.

00:38.611 --> 00:40.678
I've been doing this a
long time is my point.

00:40.703 --> 00:43.687
Well, Yuri, Phil Dunphy is no pushover.

00:43.923 --> 00:46.220
I'm afraid it's a hard nyet.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.055
I guess these are clean enough.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.467
I'll have this thing
running in no time, honey.

00:53.492 --> 00:55.110
I have an instructional video,

00:55.135 --> 00:57.972
and I'm labeling each
part as I take it out.

00:57.997 --> 01:00.206
"Right-back corner.

01:00.231 --> 01:03.432
"Tiny elbow-y thingy.

01:03.503 --> 01:06.338
"My right. Dryer left."

01:06.363 --> 01:07.964
Can't you do this somewhere else?

01:07.989 --> 01:10.356
Right, the dryer's the one
that needs to get its own place.

01:10.381 --> 01:12.925
Honey, you have to be up anyhow.
We've got our cooking class.

01:12.950 --> 01:14.826
I want to get there early
and grab a stove up front.

01:14.851 --> 01:16.472
Oh, my God, Mom. You and that chef.

01:16.497 --> 01:18.027
Keep it in your apron.

01:18.528 --> 01:20.828
Mom's obsessed with this
TV chef Charles Dumont.

01:20.853 --> 01:22.550
She watches his show every day.

01:22.575 --> 01:24.675
Not sure she listens, though.

01:24.738 --> 01:26.003
A pinch of sugar,

01:26.028 --> 01:28.762
and your taste buds will
surrender like the French.

01:28.997 --> 01:31.164
I'm sorry, that joke
was a little fromage-y.

01:31.266 --> 01:32.995
- Did he say salt?
- Sugar.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.172
Mmm! I'd love to give him some sugar.

01:35.197 --> 01:38.017
But I'm pretty sure he
said salt here, baby.

01:38.042 --> 01:39.216
- Take taste.
- Oh, no. Aah!

01:39.241 --> 01:40.525
- Mmm?
- Hmm! Yeah.

01:40.550 --> 01:42.370
- Yeah? Yeah.
- That's got something in it.

01:42.395 --> 01:44.154
- Oh, almost out of cookin' juice.
- Mm-hmm.

01:44.179 --> 01:46.780
All right, the next
step is very important.

01:46.805 --> 01:48.002
You sure you don't want to pause it?

01:48.027 --> 01:49.417
Oh, no, I'm good.

01:49.925 --> 01:51.318
- We got to fix this.
- Mm-hmm

01:51.343 --> 01:52.925
We can't tell her how bad her food is

01:52.950 --> 01:54.765
because that would destroy her.

01:54.790 --> 01:57.175
So when I found out Chef
Dumont was coming to town,

01:57.200 --> 02:00.068
I signed us up for his
class, so he could do it.

02:03.066 --> 02:04.199
- Whoa!
- I know.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.701
Pretty intense, huh?

02:05.726 --> 02:08.033
Now I just grab the sensor

02:08.136 --> 02:10.714
and put it...

02:10.761 --> 02:12.370
Oh, a little linty.

02:13.490 --> 02:15.652
I probably should have emptied...

02:16.879 --> 02:18.378
Aah! Are the parts okay?

02:18.480 --> 02:20.380
- Yeah, they're fine.
- Oh, thank God.

02:20.482 --> 02:21.748
I don't know... Ow!

02:30.863 --> 02:35.340
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

02:37.805 --> 02:39.749
All right, Joe. Fire it in here, buddy.

02:39.774 --> 02:41.300
Ooh! Yes!

02:41.325 --> 02:43.117
Good. Now I don't have
to tell another son

02:43.142 --> 02:44.852
that some boys have different gifts.

02:44.877 --> 02:46.176
Good job there, slugger.

02:46.201 --> 02:48.332
What the hell's going on here, Gloria?

02:48.357 --> 02:50.835
I feel like I died. I'm
watching my family as a ghost.

02:50.860 --> 02:52.195
Don't be silly. If that happened,

02:52.236 --> 02:54.334
I would have changed all this furniture.

02:54.359 --> 02:56.711
I hired Coach Gary.

02:56.736 --> 02:59.008
He's gonna teach Joe how to throw.

02:59.033 --> 03:01.711
Joe is the worst in his team.

03:01.736 --> 03:03.569
I hear you!

03:03.594 --> 03:05.316
Your son's in good hands, Jay.

03:05.341 --> 03:07.820
I led my team to the
championship last year.

03:07.845 --> 03:10.553
We weren't supposed to keep
score, but I did in my head.

03:10.578 --> 03:11.639
This is crazy.

03:11.664 --> 03:14.133
A kid's supposed to learn
this stuff from his dad...

03:14.158 --> 03:16.291
baseball, how to drive a car,

03:16.316 --> 03:17.680
how to fight a guy from Jersey.

03:17.705 --> 03:18.837
If you think you took his knife...

03:18.862 --> 03:20.258
He's got another one.

03:20.431 --> 03:22.641
Joe learned to throw by copying Jay,

03:22.666 --> 03:25.883
but Jay throws all crazy
because of his bad shoulder.

03:26.180 --> 03:27.828
Like this, buddy.

03:28.712 --> 03:30.335
Son of a...!

03:32.113 --> 03:33.846
Son of a...!

03:34.921 --> 03:36.717
It's the same reason Joe whistles

03:36.742 --> 03:39.176
"Sentimental Journey" when he pees.

03:39.663 --> 03:41.148
You seem like a nice guy and all,

03:41.173 --> 03:42.530
but, uh, I got this.

03:42.576 --> 03:45.100
Hey, no sweat. Coach Gary gets it.

03:45.691 --> 03:48.100
Hey, uh, don't forget your ball.

03:52.467 --> 03:53.967
It's okay, Jay.

03:53.992 --> 03:57.084
Some boys have different gifts.

03:58.299 --> 03:59.866
Let me get the door.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.023
Okay, thank you.

04:03.187 --> 04:05.647
- Hi. Can I help you?
- I'm here for Lily.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.647
I always knew this day would come.

04:07.672 --> 04:08.938
Probably not what she's here for.

04:08.963 --> 04:10.096
How do you know our daughter?

04:10.121 --> 04:12.201
I don't. She hired
me for a cleaning job.

04:12.226 --> 04:13.286
- Oh.
- What?

04:13.311 --> 04:14.467
Wow. Right on time.

04:14.492 --> 04:16.630
Wait, Lily, did you
hire a cleaning lady?

04:16.656 --> 04:17.959
Yeah, with an app on your phone.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.802
Daddy said my room was a pig sty.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.841
Okay, we'll double
back to that unnecessary

04:21.867 --> 04:23.412
and inaccurate slam on pigs,

04:23.437 --> 04:25.522
and I think daddy meant
for you to clean your room.

04:25.547 --> 04:26.912
We can't have you cleaning
our daughter's room.

04:26.937 --> 04:28.975
It just... it sends the wrong message.

04:29.109 --> 04:31.009
We get to review you
guys, too, you know.

04:31.034 --> 04:33.491
Okay. Now go clean your room.

04:33.516 --> 04:35.966
It's not fair. You guys
use apps for everything.

04:35.991 --> 04:37.366
No, we don't.

04:37.391 --> 04:38.413
Well...

04:38.438 --> 04:40.638
Okay, there's Uber
for when we eat out...

04:40.683 --> 04:42.483
and Postmates for when we eat in.

04:42.570 --> 04:44.336
And TaskRabbit for
stuff around the house.

04:44.361 --> 04:45.866
And Washio and ParkMe

04:45.891 --> 04:47.611
and the one where the guy comes over

04:47.636 --> 04:48.901
and builds a fire in your fireplace.

04:48.926 --> 04:50.926
Oh, LogBuddy. I love LogBuddy.

04:50.951 --> 04:52.936
We need to start leading by example.

04:52.961 --> 04:56.129
From now on, we're all gonna
be a little more self-reliant.

04:56.154 --> 04:58.521
For starters, I'll build the fires.

04:58.546 --> 05:01.681
But the LogBuddy guy comes
dressed as a lumberjack.

05:01.706 --> 05:04.074
I have a flannel shirt.

05:04.826 --> 05:05.893
Huh?

05:05.961 --> 05:07.147
Where are all the extra pieces?

05:07.172 --> 05:09.573
There aren't any. I used every last one.

05:09.598 --> 05:10.708
Did you throw them away?

05:10.733 --> 05:12.366
You can tell me. I won't be angry.

05:12.401 --> 05:13.921
I fixed the dryer, Claire,

05:13.946 --> 05:16.795
and you get to be here
for the moment of truth.

05:17.159 --> 05:18.565
Pull the pin.

05:22.244 --> 05:23.790
It works.

05:23.815 --> 05:26.791
I had no idea you were
so good with your hands.

05:26.832 --> 05:28.143
Very manly.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.807
I pinched my thumb with
a pair of pliers earlier.

05:30.972 --> 05:32.048
Not a peep.

05:32.073 --> 05:33.840
Luke, Daddy and I need to go upstairs

05:33.865 --> 05:35.415
to discuss something in private.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.207
Just go. You're ruining sex for me.

05:41.245 --> 05:44.073
Oh, we just created some
static in these sheets, huh?

05:44.098 --> 05:45.925
- That felt amazing.
- Yeah.

05:45.950 --> 05:49.073
I got all up in that dryer
and fixed the hell out of it.

05:50.555 --> 05:52.384
I feel capable of anything.

05:52.409 --> 05:54.229
- You know what?
- Hmm?

05:54.726 --> 05:55.868
I'm gonna build it.

05:55.893 --> 05:57.393
- Dunphy Tower?
- Dunphy Tower.

05:57.495 --> 05:58.527
Dunphy Tower...

05:58.629 --> 06:00.529
My first commercial
real-estate development.

06:00.622 --> 06:02.228
I've been dreaming of
building it since I was a kid,

06:02.262 --> 06:03.999
and now it's all happening.

06:04.205 --> 06:06.112
Well, minus the
trampoline park on the roof

06:06.137 --> 06:08.070
and the tunnel to my
best friend's house.

06:08.172 --> 06:10.539
I am still holding out
hope for a fireman's pole

06:10.564 --> 06:12.852
that takes you to the parking garage.

06:12.877 --> 06:14.877
Well, if you're sure
you're finally ready.

06:14.946 --> 06:16.756
Of course I am. I just fixed the dryer.

06:16.781 --> 06:18.214
Hmm.

06:18.316 --> 06:21.159
And it was the most satisfying
thing I've ever done.

06:21.953 --> 06:24.487
I'll just get dressed, I guess.

06:32.637 --> 06:33.770
Ta-da!

06:33.795 --> 06:35.621
Phil, I know where we are. I drove.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.675
You know what this is,

06:36.700 --> 06:38.532
but I'm about to tell
you what this could be.

06:38.557 --> 06:40.464
This is my least-favorite
way of talking.

06:40.497 --> 06:43.212
You are standing on the
site of the future...

06:43.237 --> 06:44.550
Dunphy Tower.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.368
A quarter acre of mixed-use space

06:46.437 --> 06:48.330
in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood.

06:48.355 --> 06:50.160
Commercial real estate, huh?

06:50.254 --> 06:51.628
This is a departure for you.

06:51.653 --> 06:53.486
I thought about it
down to the last detail.

06:53.575 --> 06:54.707
Imagine a happy worker

06:54.776 --> 06:56.615
coming down from their
transit-friendly office

06:56.655 --> 06:58.707
for a fancy coffee beverage or yoga,

06:58.732 --> 07:00.404
and what's that over there?

07:00.834 --> 07:02.278
A doll's foot, I hope.

07:02.303 --> 07:03.936
A farm-to-table dog bakery.

07:03.961 --> 07:06.645
Ooh, Stella and I went to
one of those in Solvang.

07:06.670 --> 07:09.238
She got a quiche. It looked so
good, I almost split it with her.

07:09.340 --> 07:10.773
I don't want you to
feel pressured to invest,

07:10.798 --> 07:12.251
but I want you to
know this isn't a whim.

07:12.276 --> 07:13.763
I've been thinking about this a lot.

07:13.788 --> 07:15.244
What got you off the sidelines?

07:15.312 --> 07:18.263
This is gonna sound silly,
but I fixed a dryer today.

07:18.288 --> 07:20.617
I took it all apart and
swapped out the sensor.

07:20.642 --> 07:21.679
Get out of here.

07:21.714 --> 07:23.881
The guy wanted 350 bucks. I paid $28.

07:23.983 --> 07:25.216
Holy cow!

07:25.241 --> 07:27.478
How come we haven't been talking
about this the whole time?

07:27.503 --> 07:29.336
Because I'm so excited
about this project.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.311
I-I really think this
could be a good investment.

07:31.336 --> 07:32.414
I don't want to hear any more.

07:32.439 --> 07:35.016
You're the most cautious guy I
know when it comes to business.

07:35.041 --> 07:37.586
If you think this is
a slam dunk, I'm in.

07:37.611 --> 07:38.661
Really?

07:38.686 --> 07:39.919
'Cause I have an offer ready to go.

07:39.944 --> 07:41.539
- You say the word, I hit "send."
- Do it.

07:41.564 --> 07:43.460
I've been looking for
investment opportunities.

07:43.485 --> 07:45.694
If you're confident, I'm confident.

07:47.339 --> 07:49.936
Because you know what I'd do
to you if you blew my money.

07:55.481 --> 07:58.996
All right, you are about
to get an important lesson

07:59.021 --> 08:00.955
on self-reliance, young lady.

08:01.057 --> 08:03.234
I know he's serious when
he calls me "young lady."

08:03.259 --> 08:05.523
My dad did the same thing. Okay.

08:05.548 --> 08:07.928
Okay, no more doing
chores with our phones.

08:07.953 --> 08:10.154
We are going to get our hands dirty.

08:10.222 --> 08:11.881
And, Mitchell, you're
gonna start right here

08:11.906 --> 08:13.170
and manscape this.

08:13.195 --> 08:15.398
- Really? Okay.
- And guess what you're gonna do?

08:15.423 --> 08:17.056
Can I be in charge
of watering the cement

08:17.081 --> 08:18.480
- like the gardener?
- Nope.

08:18.505 --> 08:20.304
You're gonna get down
on your hands and knees

08:20.329 --> 08:21.395
and pick weeds.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.080
- Aw!
- Aw!

08:23.105 --> 08:25.432
You... you know what I had
to do when I was your age?

08:25.457 --> 08:28.748
I had to crawl through a
cornfield and pick up rocks.

08:28.773 --> 08:30.752
That's right. I couldn't
even have breakfast

08:30.777 --> 08:32.315
until I picked 100.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.650
I'd strap a flashlight to my head,

08:34.676 --> 08:36.198
and off I'd go.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.624
One rock, two rocks,

08:38.799 --> 08:40.118
three rocks.

08:40.143 --> 08:41.167
Oh, my God!

08:41.192 --> 08:43.745
- It's called dramatic tension.
- It's called a beehive.

08:43.770 --> 08:44.800
- What?!
- Right... right there.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.837
Yep. Mm-hmm.

08:45.862 --> 08:47.206
- Oh, Oh, no. It's worse.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:47.231 --> 08:49.432
- Those are wasps.
- Oh, I hate wasps!

08:49.457 --> 08:51.354
No, not you, Mr. Fletcher. The...

08:51.379 --> 08:52.812
Come on.

08:52.940 --> 08:54.122
Gloria?

08:54.190 --> 08:56.157
Phil got me to invest in a mini-mall,

08:56.182 --> 08:57.389
so you might want to dial back

08:57.414 --> 08:59.070
on the shoe purchases for a while.

08:59.095 --> 09:00.913
One second, one second.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.942
"Place order."

09:02.967 --> 09:04.412
What did you say, baby?

09:04.437 --> 09:05.858
- Drawer's fixed.
- What the hell?!

09:05.883 --> 09:07.383
Don't sneak up on people like that.

09:07.408 --> 09:09.536
I'm liable to have knocked you out.

09:09.561 --> 09:11.943
- I doubt it.
- I was gonna fix that, anyway.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.060
Ay. Like you were going
to clean the gutter?

09:14.085 --> 09:15.652
Coach Gary did it already.

09:15.687 --> 09:17.123
It really wasn't a problem.

09:17.148 --> 09:18.866
I'm not afraid of heights, and...

09:18.891 --> 09:20.216
I've got big hands.

09:20.241 --> 09:22.147
Those are fun details.

09:22.685 --> 09:24.552
It's like the guy was
trying to steal my life.

09:24.577 --> 09:26.296
I wish he'd shown up when
I was married to Dede.

09:26.321 --> 09:27.873
I would have made him a key.

09:28.084 --> 09:29.577
Let me show you out,
although you sound like

09:29.602 --> 09:31.233
you know the place pretty good already.

09:31.258 --> 09:32.716
Hey, Jay, I've got a date Friday night.

09:32.741 --> 09:33.966
- Can I borrow your car?
- Sure,

09:33.991 --> 09:35.265
you can borrow your mother's car.

09:35.290 --> 09:37.373
- Who's the lucky girl?
- Rachel Caputo.

09:37.398 --> 09:39.428
She and Manny work on
the school paper together.

09:39.514 --> 09:41.348
Extra, extra, she's a cutie.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.415
Thanks for your help.

09:42.484 --> 09:44.904
Hey, I just played the ukulele.

09:44.928 --> 09:46.442
- You sang the song.
- Yeah.

09:46.467 --> 09:48.663
- Coach Cupid!
- All right, Gar.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.342
You don't want to miss that bus.

09:50.367 --> 09:51.880
Thanks again, Coach Gary.

09:51.905 --> 09:53.369
He's not even your coach.

09:53.394 --> 09:55.661
I need a scotch and
a James Bond marathon.

09:55.686 --> 09:56.706
You may be out of luck.

09:56.774 --> 09:58.074
The TV wasn't working a minute ago.

09:58.142 --> 09:59.519
Sounds like the satellite dish.

09:59.544 --> 10:02.118
Big Hands probably messed it
up poking around in my gutters.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.719
- Let me check it out.
- No, no, no.

10:03.744 --> 10:05.277
That might be very dangerous.

10:05.346 --> 10:07.446
Let me go grab Coach
Gary, and he can help you.

10:07.471 --> 10:08.491
I said I'd do it.

10:08.516 --> 10:09.782
Yeah, but I'm sure Coach Gary

10:09.807 --> 10:11.173
wouldn't mind sticking around.

10:11.198 --> 10:13.233
I'm getting that impression myself!

10:14.053 --> 10:15.600
Thank you all for coming.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.626
Who here wants to go to Paris right now?

10:17.651 --> 10:19.256
- Moi!
- No.

10:19.281 --> 10:20.509
We're not getting on a plane.

10:20.554 --> 10:24.089
We'll be transported by
these humble ingredients.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.708
How great is he?

10:25.733 --> 10:27.678
So great. Listen to everything he says.

10:27.703 --> 10:30.070
Look to your left. Look to your right.

10:30.095 --> 10:31.803
Before this class is through,

10:31.828 --> 10:34.866
all of you will know how to
make herb-roasted chicken!

10:34.891 --> 10:36.491
Ohh! I know this recipe.

10:36.516 --> 10:39.116
- I could make this chicken in my sleep.
- How about we try it awake?

10:39.141 --> 10:42.091
Let's start with the most
important ingredient... thyme.

10:42.116 --> 10:44.283
That's right. It's time to chop thyme.

10:44.351 --> 10:46.983
- He's just like he is on TV.
- Yeah.

10:47.008 --> 10:49.263
Thyme and chicken play
together very well,

10:49.288 --> 10:51.427
unlike dogs and chickens.

10:51.452 --> 10:53.458
Tragic story... my rescue whippet and I

10:53.483 --> 10:55.075
live next to an urban farm and...

10:55.100 --> 10:57.880
Oh, my, do you mind if
I use this as an example?

10:57.905 --> 11:00.068
Oh! Avec pleasure.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.272
See how she's chopped it...

11:02.297 --> 11:04.186
stems and all?

11:04.211 --> 11:05.543
That's wrong.

11:05.676 --> 11:08.142
Sloppiness like this can ruin a dish.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.817
Oh. I had no idea.

11:09.842 --> 11:11.702
I suppose when it
comes to herbs, though,

11:11.727 --> 11:13.315
you're something of a sage.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.951
- That's clever.
- Thank you.

11:14.976 --> 11:16.208
- You can't eat clever.
- Oh.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.452
Freeze! Police!

11:22.477 --> 11:24.344
I'm a Realtor. I'm not a criminal.

11:24.369 --> 11:26.099
Oh, well, then you're
not doing it right.

11:27.174 --> 11:28.175
Hey, Gil.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.474
If one of your clients
is actually thinking

11:29.499 --> 11:31.485
about buying this minefield,

11:31.510 --> 11:33.708
that would be their second bad decision.

11:34.212 --> 11:35.879
- First was hiring you.
- Yeah, I got it.

11:35.947 --> 11:38.185
You're not gonna push one of your
clients into this swamp, are you?

11:38.210 --> 11:40.310
Maybe it just needs a
developer with a little vision.

11:40.379 --> 11:41.896
Very little vision

11:41.921 --> 11:43.551
and no sense of smell.

11:43.576 --> 11:45.209
I mean, this neighborhood
makes El Segundo

11:45.234 --> 11:46.320
seem like a Sephora.

11:46.345 --> 11:47.645
It's in transition.

11:47.747 --> 11:50.207
Yeah, it's turning into Fallujah.

11:50.232 --> 11:52.383
I'm out of here before I get jacked.

11:52.896 --> 11:54.895
- You gonna be around here for a while?
- I might.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.210
Maybe you can score me some methadone.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.191
- Hey, Bob.
- Good news, Phil.

12:02.216 --> 12:03.466
They accepted your offer.

12:03.491 --> 12:05.802
Without a counter?
Maybe I came in too high.

12:05.827 --> 12:07.161
Whatever. They were really happy.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.585
Are...

12:08.610 --> 12:10.825
Hold on, Bob. It's my son.

12:11.122 --> 12:13.490
- Luke, what's up?
- Dad?

12:13.515 --> 12:15.747
I think something's
wrong with the dryer.

12:15.772 --> 12:17.338
But I-I fixed it.

12:17.363 --> 12:18.982
I fixed it good.

12:19.068 --> 12:20.401
I'll be right there.

12:20.426 --> 12:22.950
Hurry! I think it's leaving.

12:25.271 --> 12:27.328
Now, this is fresh produce.

12:27.353 --> 12:28.553
I can't even describe...

12:28.593 --> 12:30.014
Strike three!

12:30.414 --> 12:32.548
How exactly is this an improvement?

12:32.573 --> 12:34.240
Jay pick that lamp.

12:34.265 --> 12:36.504
By the way, have you seen him?

12:45.627 --> 12:47.055
I don't know how I got stuck.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.280
I've been on roofs since
I was 14 and discovered

12:49.305 --> 12:52.150
it was the best way to see
into Ethel Burkin's bedroom.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.152
Older gal. 50s, I think.

12:54.188 --> 12:55.754
Today you probably wouldn't
give her a second look,

12:55.823 --> 12:57.489
but this was before the Internet.

12:57.558 --> 12:59.805
It was either that or a Sears catalog.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.821
Can I take a picture of this?

13:01.846 --> 13:04.267
Sometimes my friends
don't believe my stories.

13:04.292 --> 13:05.958
There's got to be a
better way of doing this.

13:05.983 --> 13:07.228
On the contrary, Mitchell.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.419
It's simplicity itself.

13:08.444 --> 13:10.796
I dislodge the nest. It
falls into the trash can.

13:10.821 --> 13:11.954
You close the lid.

13:12.023 --> 13:13.870
Then we just have a
barrel full of angry wasps.

13:13.895 --> 13:16.502
Which we swiftly
transport to a farm upstate

13:16.527 --> 13:18.070
where they'll be much happier.

13:18.095 --> 13:20.047
Ooh, they'll see my friend's dog.

13:20.072 --> 13:21.893
Yeah, just like that.

13:22.932 --> 13:26.345
All right. First, we just
have to dislodge the nest.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.692
No, no, no, no!

13:29.974 --> 13:31.674
There's one on my face.
There's one on my face!

13:31.776 --> 13:34.362
Don't move. I've been compromised.

13:34.387 --> 13:35.711
Okay, g-get in the house.

13:35.736 --> 13:38.370
Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow! Ooh! Bad idea!

13:38.395 --> 13:40.979
Ow! I was gonna take you to a farm!

13:41.004 --> 13:42.356
Ow! Ohh!

13:47.958 --> 13:50.025
I may have to change the
name of this side dish

13:50.050 --> 13:52.484
to "potatoes au great-in."

13:52.777 --> 13:55.284
I'm not hearing a difference.

13:55.553 --> 13:56.597
Great.

13:56.622 --> 13:58.245
Oh, this is... unique.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.536
Yes, thank you very much.

13:59.561 --> 14:02.277
You know how on your show
you were always taking chances

14:02.302 --> 14:03.487
and trusting your instincts?

14:03.512 --> 14:04.677
Well, that is what I did.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.144
That's because...

14:06.169 --> 14:07.769
- I have good instincts.
- Mm-hmm.

14:07.794 --> 14:09.714
What's something you do well?

14:09.739 --> 14:11.067
- Cook? Hmm.
- No.

14:11.092 --> 14:12.816
Uh, Mom, I think what he's trying to say

14:12.841 --> 14:14.777
is that you should more
closely follow his recipe.

14:14.802 --> 14:16.681
You know, use the
ingredients that he mentions.

14:16.706 --> 14:17.760
Measure stuff.

14:17.785 --> 14:18.984
- Right?
- Not at all.

14:19.152 --> 14:22.011
As I say in the foreword of my
third book, "Who Can't Cook?,"

14:22.036 --> 14:24.323
"Some people can't cook."

14:24.691 --> 14:25.892
Don't feel bad.

14:25.917 --> 14:28.026
Gourmet cooking is tough,

14:28.095 --> 14:29.394
though not as tough as your chicken.

14:29.463 --> 14:30.929
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

14:30.998 --> 14:33.147
It's times like this I
wish I had a refund policy.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.409
Wait a second. I have
been making this food

14:35.434 --> 14:37.781
for my family for months now.

14:37.806 --> 14:39.480
I make a big meal every Sunday.

14:39.505 --> 14:40.917
I'm a working mom.

14:40.942 --> 14:43.035
It's my one chance a week

14:43.060 --> 14:44.469
to give my family something

14:44.494 --> 14:46.561
and make up for the time
I haven't spent with them.

14:46.629 --> 14:49.870
Are you telling me that I
have been giving my family...

14:49.895 --> 14:51.737
garbage? Wait, uh...

14:52.347 --> 14:53.981
Haley, honey,

14:54.006 --> 14:55.939
have I been serving you garbage?

14:56.159 --> 14:57.847
Um...

14:58.119 --> 14:59.691
What do you think I said?

15:00.292 --> 15:01.815
She is the best cook ever.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.005
We love all of her meals.

15:03.107 --> 15:04.550
- Hmm!
- Yeah.

15:04.575 --> 15:05.608
Mm-hmm.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.486
- And my singing?
- So good!

15:07.519 --> 15:09.175
So...

15:10.389 --> 15:11.816
Jay?

15:13.644 --> 15:14.984
Jay!

15:15.086 --> 15:16.586
I'm up here.

15:16.897 --> 15:19.927
Ay, Dios mío! Your time was too short!

15:19.952 --> 15:21.381
I'm on the roof.

15:21.406 --> 15:23.342
Ah. Oh, okay. So...

15:23.367 --> 15:25.945
come down because the
TV's working already.

15:25.970 --> 15:29.435
You know, I'm kind of enjoying
hanging out up here. I...

15:29.460 --> 15:31.161
I'll be down in a little bit.

15:31.186 --> 15:34.029
Hey, if Joe wants to
work on his throwing arm,

15:34.054 --> 15:36.321
maybe he can toss up,
uh, an empty bottle.

15:36.389 --> 15:37.856
Are you stuck up there?

15:37.958 --> 15:39.849
Stuck? No!

15:39.874 --> 15:42.491
I can come down whenever
I want to. I just have to...

15:42.819 --> 15:45.983
dangle my body out over the
edge and then reach blindly

15:46.008 --> 15:49.107
for that top rung of the ladder
you're not supposed to use.

15:49.132 --> 15:50.549
But I'll be in in a little bit.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.514
I got a few things I got to do.

15:52.539 --> 15:54.163
Got to maintain the roof.

15:54.508 --> 15:55.908
It's your house's hat.

16:01.906 --> 16:02.995
I called the one person

16:03.020 --> 16:06.065
I couldn't possibly be
embarrassed in front of.

16:08.439 --> 16:10.149
- It's Grandpa.
- Don't answer!

16:10.174 --> 16:11.494
He can't know about this.

16:11.519 --> 16:13.286
We have a verbal contract
that's largely based

16:13.311 --> 16:15.414
on my ability to fix dryers.

16:16.251 --> 16:17.551
Please work.

16:19.656 --> 16:21.260
Yes!

16:22.565 --> 16:23.875
Maybe.

16:28.258 --> 16:29.555
What's that smell?

16:29.580 --> 16:30.812
Failure.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.904
Oh, Cam, that sting looks really bad.

16:37.929 --> 16:39.296
We... we should get you to a doctor.

16:39.321 --> 16:41.121
A doctor for a wasp sting?

16:41.146 --> 16:42.532
Yes, let's put on our top hats

16:42.557 --> 16:44.157
and eat crumpets while we're on our way.

16:44.259 --> 16:45.792
Okay, I know you think
you're making a point.

16:45.894 --> 16:47.374
Back on the farm,

16:47.399 --> 16:49.562
every time we would
take down a wasp nest,

16:49.631 --> 16:50.859
I would get stung.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.016
Something you might have mentioned.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.453
And never once did I
need fancy medicine.

16:54.478 --> 16:55.578
Just a little mud.

16:55.603 --> 16:56.768
That's right, Lily.

16:56.793 --> 16:59.128
Daddy's being self-reliant.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.969
What do you think the chances
are he means actual mud?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.819
- Pretty good.
- Like my Aunt Dot said,

17:04.845 --> 17:06.766
"Whether it's bee stings or back aches,

17:06.790 --> 17:09.090
"a little mud is good
for what ails you."

17:09.160 --> 17:10.759
I don't remember meeting an Aunt Dot.

17:10.861 --> 17:12.127
She died.

17:12.229 --> 17:13.963
15 minutes later.

17:14.295 --> 17:15.455
All right.

17:15.481 --> 17:16.535
I thought I'd make you a little bit...

17:16.560 --> 17:17.900
Oh, my God!

17:17.925 --> 17:19.001
What? My face?

17:19.026 --> 17:20.657
Is it bad? It feels bad.

17:20.683 --> 17:23.016
It looks a little like you
stared directly into the Lost Ark.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.243
- I want to see.
- You don't.

17:24.269 --> 17:26.262
Do you think maybe me putting
mud on it made it worse?

17:26.288 --> 17:29.450
I don't know how putting dirt
directly into a wound, it-it...

17:29.475 --> 17:30.578
Where are you going?

17:30.603 --> 17:32.793
To the doctor. I want
to be pretty again.

17:32.895 --> 17:34.227
Well, w-what about being self-reliant?

17:34.330 --> 17:36.997
It's my face! Let's go!

17:38.500 --> 17:41.040
Whoo! Wasps! They're still out there!

17:44.361 --> 17:46.056
Yeah, I'll hold.

17:46.244 --> 17:47.481
I'm pulling out of the deal.

17:47.506 --> 17:48.671
Why? What happened?

17:48.696 --> 17:51.064
I'm not the man you thought you
had middle-of-the-day sex with.

17:51.089 --> 17:52.783
Honey, I heard about the dryer.

17:52.808 --> 17:54.578
It's not just that. I ran into Gil.

17:54.603 --> 17:56.082
He thinks it's a bad idea.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.431
Your dad's money is on the line.

17:57.456 --> 17:58.989
I've never done anything like this.

17:59.014 --> 18:00.730
Who cares what Gil Thorpe thinks?

18:00.755 --> 18:02.845
Nobody knows more about
real estate than you do,

18:02.870 --> 18:06.105
and you've been thinking about
this project for a long time.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.504
I believe in you.

18:07.529 --> 18:09.500
You should believe in yourself.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.865
Yeah, hey, Bob.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.333
It's Phil.

18:13.435 --> 18:16.554
Remove the contingencies. Let's do this.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.945
Is that a fact?

18:19.240 --> 18:20.940
Thanks for letting me know.

18:21.443 --> 18:22.953
Gil Thorpe made a backup offer.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.076
He was just trying to scare me away.

18:25.101 --> 18:27.365
Oh! I am so proud of you!

18:27.390 --> 18:30.858
Wow. Looks like the both of us had
a little crisis of confidence today.

18:30.883 --> 18:32.750
In that cooking class...

18:32.852 --> 18:33.951
- Yes?
- Yes, well,

18:33.986 --> 18:36.654
Chef Dumont had the audacity

18:36.756 --> 18:38.154
to tell me that I can't cook.

18:38.179 --> 18:39.411
- Huh.
- Mm.

18:39.555 --> 18:43.290
Luckily, this one was
there to straighten him out.

18:43.392 --> 18:44.975
I'm gonna make you a celebratory dinner.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.218
I think I've got most
of the ingredients.

18:46.243 --> 18:48.392
- I can't wait!
- Mm-hmm.

18:48.417 --> 18:50.317
You had one job.

18:52.874 --> 18:53.940
Hi, Jay.

18:54.042 --> 18:56.139
Oh, crap. She called you.

18:56.164 --> 18:57.781
- Give me your hand.
- Why?

18:57.806 --> 18:59.561
So you can show me up again?

18:59.737 --> 19:01.999
- What are you talking about?
- Give it a rest.

19:02.024 --> 19:04.401
You come in here with
your young shoulders,

19:04.426 --> 19:06.112
your ukulele.

19:06.283 --> 19:07.661
I'm not trying to show you up, Jay.

19:07.764 --> 19:09.885
I'm trying to impress you.

19:10.072 --> 19:12.299
Why the heck would you want to do that?

19:12.463 --> 19:14.157
I guess you could say that, like you,

19:14.182 --> 19:16.337
I'm stranded in my own way.

19:16.362 --> 19:18.062
This is my least-favorite
way of talking.

19:18.164 --> 19:20.112
I got to tell you, Jay,

19:20.499 --> 19:22.199
I'm over the whole sports thing.

19:22.268 --> 19:23.782
But you just won the championship.

19:23.807 --> 19:26.403
Exactly. And there's
no more Dragons to slay.

19:26.505 --> 19:27.805
That's the team we beat last year...

19:27.907 --> 19:29.006
the Baby Blue Dragons.

19:29.108 --> 19:31.017
I'm not seeing how I figure into this.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.719
I want to start my own business.

19:32.744 --> 19:34.310
You've been so successful.

19:34.412 --> 19:37.079
I was thinking maybe
you could be my mentor.

19:37.182 --> 19:39.362
- What line of work?
- Pre-fab gazebos.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.483
Nice!

19:40.585 --> 19:42.385
Every backyard could
be its own town square.

19:42.487 --> 19:43.686
I knew you'd get it.

19:43.788 --> 19:45.254
After all, what's a gazebo but...

19:45.356 --> 19:46.722
- ... an outdoor closet?
- An outdoor closet!

19:46.838 --> 19:48.524
You're all right, Coach Gary.

19:48.593 --> 19:50.459
Give me your hand. Help me down.

19:50.562 --> 19:52.461
We'll get a few drinks,
and we'll talk business.

19:52.486 --> 19:54.094
Gary's Gazebos.

19:54.365 --> 19:55.616
Gazebos by Gary.

19:55.641 --> 19:57.333
Gary's Gazebos and Sheds.

19:57.435 --> 19:58.734
You don't need me.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.117
All right.

20:04.341 --> 20:05.575
Is this you...

20:05.600 --> 20:08.003
sitting alone in an empty yard

20:08.028 --> 20:09.442
wishing you had....

20:09.467 --> 20:10.767
a gazebo...

20:10.792 --> 20:12.090
or a shed?

20:12.115 --> 20:13.514
If it is,

20:13.539 --> 20:15.973
then call Gary's Gazebos and Sheds

20:15.998 --> 20:18.332
because here, we only do one thing...

20:18.357 --> 20:19.723
sell, install,

20:19.748 --> 20:21.416
and service gazebos and sheds.

20:21.441 --> 20:22.558
_

20:23.615 --> 20:24.781
Whoa!

20:24.806 --> 20:27.073
And ask about our bird baths.

20:27.329 --> 20:29.395
We own 10% of that, you know.

20:29.568 --> 20:31.534
How much money did you
put into the businesses?

20:31.559 --> 20:33.526
Well, you can't take it with you.

20:33.551 --> 20:35.710
Well, we'll all still be here!
