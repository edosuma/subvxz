WEBVTT

00:13.876 --> 00:16.542
(soft, intense music)

00:21.918 --> 00:24.125
(men yelling indistinctly)

00:38.083 --> 00:40.751
(indistinct, overlapping

00:38.083 --> 00:40.751
yelling)

00:51.959 --> 00:53.209
(gunshot)

01:00.584 --> 01:02.542
(thudding, grunting)

01:04.167 --> 01:07.334
(fighting commotion)

01:11.751 --> 01:12.834
(no audible scream)

01:17.083 --> 01:19.584
(fighting commotion continues)

01:26.959 --> 01:28.459
(explosion)

01:35.792 --> 01:39.209
(indistinct yelling)

01:39.250 --> 01:40.709
(agonizing scream)

01:43.626 --> 01:44.876
(loud scream)

01:44.918 --> 01:46.709
(commotion becomes muffled)

01:46.751 --> 01:48.626
(soft music)

01:50.209 --> 01:52.417
(commotion continues)

01:56.751 --> 01:59.334
- McTaggart!

02:01.459 --> 02:02.417
(gunshot)

02:15.125 --> 02:16.667
(explosion)

02:18.209 --> 02:20.292
(gunshots)

02:23.000 --> 02:26.250
(dramatic music)

02:45.292 --> 02:47.459
(music fades)

02:51.709 --> 02:53.584
(soft music)

03:02.292 --> 03:04.751
(dramatic music)

03:07.209 --> 03:09.500
(final crescendo, music stops)

03:11.959 --> 03:14.959
(theme music)

04:11.751 --> 04:13.918
(Michael): The plan that

04:11.751 --> 04:13.918
our partnership agreed upon

04:13.959 --> 04:17.125
is completely dependent on

04:13.959 --> 04:17.125
O'Reilly and his men

04:13.959 --> 04:17.125
throwing their weight behind us.

04:17.584 --> 04:19.584
It's the only way to

04:17.584 --> 04:19.584
topple Vanstone

04:17.584 --> 04:19.584
without killing him,

04:19.626 --> 04:20.959
and I promised Kamenna that--

04:21.000 --> 04:22.876
(Sokanon):

04:21.000 --> 04:22.876
You will have to do it

04:21.000 --> 04:22.876
without him.

04:25.292 --> 04:28.000
- Harp gave me a mission:

04:25.292 --> 04:28.000
to see the HBC crumble,

04:28.042 --> 04:29.417
and that's what I'm trying

04:28.042 --> 04:29.417
to do.

04:29.792 --> 04:32.125
I've made alliances with men

04:29.792 --> 04:32.125
we once saw as enemies,

04:32.167 --> 04:34.000
because we all want

04:32.167 --> 04:34.000
the same thing.

04:34.042 --> 04:35.500
- All the men do, anyway.

04:37.709 --> 04:38.667
- Sokanon!

04:39.459 --> 04:41.500
O'Reilly's a son of a bitch,

04:39.459 --> 04:41.500
I know.

04:43.209 --> 04:45.542
I won't stop you from

04:43.209 --> 04:45.542
settling what you have

04:43.209 --> 04:45.542
with him.

04:46.167 --> 04:50.584
But in order for both of us

04:46.167 --> 04:50.584
to get what we want, we need to

04:46.167 --> 04:50.584
get rid of Vanstone first.

04:50.626 --> 04:54.375
- No, he is your distraction.

04:50.626 --> 04:54.375
O'Reilly's my target.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.584
(Imogen): In my experience,

04:56.500 --> 04:58.584
Mr. O'Reilly has always been

04:58.626 --> 05:01.167
a dependable, reliable

04:58.626 --> 05:01.167
gentleman.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.375
- He'd better come through

05:01.667 --> 05:03.375
for me.

05:05.334 --> 05:08.334
The thought of that

05:05.334 --> 05:08.334
reekie Irishman out there

05:05.334 --> 05:08.334
roaming free pisses me off.

05:08.626 --> 05:10.626
- Fort James has been neglected

05:08.626 --> 05:10.626
for too long

05:10.667 --> 05:13.876
by men with priorities other

05:10.667 --> 05:13.876
than the trade, Mr. Vanstone.

05:13.918 --> 05:17.792
- It has. But now that

05:13.918 --> 05:17.792
I'm doing the business

05:13.918 --> 05:17.792
of the Company,

05:17.834 --> 05:20.459
they'll see what Fort James

05:17.834 --> 05:20.459
could be under my command.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.083
And then, those sons of bitches

05:20.500 --> 05:24.083
out there will show me

05:20.500 --> 05:24.083
the respect I deserve.

05:24.334 --> 05:27.459
- Well, we both know someone

05:24.334 --> 05:27.459
who can take care of that

05:24.334 --> 05:27.459
for you.

05:29.209 --> 05:33.042
If you want to spend time

05:29.209 --> 05:33.042
with your girl tonight,

05:29.209 --> 05:33.042
it's gratis.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.000
- No, I can't.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.000
There's too much work

05:34.584 --> 05:38.000
to be done.

05:38.584 --> 05:41.959
But don't you work too hard

05:38.584 --> 05:41.959
before I can see you again, eh?

05:52.042 --> 05:54.209
(whispering):

05:52.042 --> 05:54.209
You're turning out

05:52.042 --> 05:54.209
to be a poor investment.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.709
If you don't start smiling

05:54.250 --> 05:56.709
for your silver,

05:56.751 --> 05:59.626
you'll end up

05:56.751 --> 05:59.626
in a very unpleasant place.

06:04.334 --> 06:09.292
- Oh, I could kick

06:04.334 --> 06:09.292
Michael's ballbag right up into

06:04.334 --> 06:09.292
his fucking chest for this.

06:09.334 --> 06:10.709
Or maybe it's you

06:09.334 --> 06:10.709
needs the kick

06:10.751 --> 06:12.667
for this stupid fuckin' plan

06:10.751 --> 06:12.667
in the first place.

06:12.709 --> 06:15.042
- Whoa, my plan was solid.

06:15.083 --> 06:19.042
I created an opportunity

06:15.083 --> 06:19.042
for us to dictate the terms

06:15.083 --> 06:19.042
of the conversation to Vanstone

06:19.083 --> 06:20.542
by bringing Michael to him!

06:20.584 --> 06:23.000
- It is Michael who needs

06:20.584 --> 06:23.000
to answer for this, Malcolm.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.334
I will not let my business

06:23.417 --> 06:27.334
be threatened

06:23.417 --> 06:27.334
by his infatuation.

06:27.375 --> 06:30.042
- He's not just infatuated,

06:27.375 --> 06:30.042
Pond.

06:30.083 --> 06:33.584
Michael is steady

06:30.083 --> 06:33.584
in his allegiance

06:30.083 --> 06:33.584
to Harp's people.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.876
- Oh, wait, wait, wait...

06:34.918 --> 06:37.459
This Sokanon...

06:34.918 --> 06:37.459
Is she Black Wolf?

06:37.500 --> 06:40.876
- It's no excuse to leave us

06:37.500 --> 06:40.876
at the mercy of that buffoon,

06:37.500 --> 06:40.876
Vanstone.

06:40.918 --> 06:43.584
- He just needs to think

06:40.918 --> 06:43.584
that he's supported,

06:44.042 --> 06:46.709
and that everyone's playing

06:44.042 --> 06:46.709
by Company rules, right?

06:46.751 --> 06:48.792
Now, we don't need Michael

06:46.751 --> 06:48.792
for that.

06:48.834 --> 06:51.751
(Pond): I'm gonna make

06:48.834 --> 06:51.751
some firm decisions

06:48.834 --> 06:51.751
in Michael's absence.

06:52.459 --> 06:54.959
I don't see a future

06:52.459 --> 06:54.959
for this company,

06:55.000 --> 06:56.959
where Vanstone's flag

06:55.000 --> 06:56.959
still flies.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.584
- If you kill Vanstone,

06:59.626 --> 07:03.918
right after that demented

06:59.626 --> 07:03.918
hard-on you're gonna get from

06:59.626 --> 07:03.918
killing him goes down,

07:03.959 --> 07:05.209
word's gonna get out.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.042
Kamenna's gonna hear

07:05.250 --> 07:07.042
about it.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.751
Soon as she knows that

07:07.083 --> 07:09.751
one of Michael's alliance

07:07.083 --> 07:09.751
has shed blood,

07:09.792 --> 07:11.667
she'll turn her back on

07:09.792 --> 07:11.667
all of us,

07:11.709 --> 07:14.209
and we'll lose

07:11.709 --> 07:14.209
the Lake Walker trade for good.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.918
When Michael returns,

07:15.959 --> 07:18.626
O'Reilly will take him

07:15.959 --> 07:18.626
to Vanstone,

07:15.959 --> 07:18.626
just like you planned.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.042
As soon as Vanstone

07:18.667 --> 07:20.042
is captured,

07:20.083 --> 07:23.125
his men will sooner stand down

07:20.083 --> 07:23.125
than fight.

07:23.167 --> 07:24.626
And that'll be the end of it.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.125
- You better be certain

07:25.417 --> 07:27.125
of that.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.042
- We'll soon find out,

07:29.667 --> 07:32.042
won't we?

07:32.959 --> 07:33.876
(snapping fingers)

07:36.500 --> 07:37.792
Until then...

07:39.334 --> 07:41.792
I should go and

07:39.334 --> 07:41.792
talk to Vanstone,

07:41.834 --> 07:44.167
try to smooth things out a bit.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.959
I'll return

07:44.709 --> 07:46.959
after I've spoken with him.

07:49.918 --> 07:50.959
(door closing)

07:52.125 --> 07:53.834
- Where the fuck

07:52.125 --> 07:53.834
do you think you're going?

07:53.876 --> 07:57.626
- If I find Michael,

07:53.876 --> 07:57.626
I can offer him a modicum

07:53.876 --> 07:57.626
of protection.

07:58.792 --> 08:01.959
It's a very dangerous world

07:58.792 --> 08:01.959
out there for Mr. Smyth,

07:58.792 --> 08:01.959
isn't it?

08:04.709 --> 08:07.709
(sighing,

08:04.709 --> 08:07.709
door opening and closing)

08:07.751 --> 08:10.083
- Did you know Sokanon

08:07.751 --> 08:10.083
was a Black Wolf?

08:13.375 --> 08:14.375
- That night...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.542
I heard her ask you

08:15.000 --> 08:17.542
about Mr. Smyth.

08:18.209 --> 08:21.584
Is she his wife?

08:18.209 --> 08:21.584
- I don't know what she is,

08:18.209 --> 08:21.584
but she's trouble we don't need!

08:21.626 --> 08:24.709
I don't think Michael

08:21.626 --> 08:24.709
understands our way, Kahwihta.

08:25.334 --> 08:27.125
What we do

08:25.334 --> 08:27.125
for our Lord and Saviour.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.459
We needs to pack up.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.459
We needs to pack up now.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.709
We needs to find Mercer

08:29.500 --> 08:31.709
and the rest of 'em,

08:31.751 --> 08:32.876
and we get out of here.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
- Do you intend

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
not to honour the deal

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
you made with those men?

08:37.542 --> 08:38.834
- Indeed, I don't.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.500
I'm gonna warn Vanstone

08:40.542 --> 08:42.500
about the coup

08:40.542 --> 08:42.500
that's forming against him,

08:42.542 --> 08:45.125
and we're gonna fly

08:42.542 --> 08:45.125
out of this den of inequity.

08:46.042 --> 08:49.042
After that, well I'll never

08:46.042 --> 08:49.042
set eyes on Michael Smyth

08:46.042 --> 08:49.042
ever again.

08:57.918 --> 08:58.834
- Ah.

09:00.709 --> 09:04.667
What's the

09:00.709 --> 09:04.667
most popular boy in town doing

09:00.709 --> 09:04.667
skulking around my ale house?

09:06.209 --> 09:08.918
- Is this not

09:06.209 --> 09:08.918
the heart of business

09:06.209 --> 09:08.918
in Fort James?

09:10.375 --> 09:13.584
- I know someone who

09:10.375 --> 09:13.584
really wants a word with you.

09:15.918 --> 09:19.500
- And I know someone

09:15.918 --> 09:19.500
who's just aching to put you

09:15.918 --> 09:19.500
in your place.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.709
So I suggest

09:19.542 --> 09:21.709
you take this money,

09:21.751 --> 09:23.876
and turn the other way, Imogen.

09:25.918 --> 09:27.584
It's the best warning

09:25.918 --> 09:27.584
you'll get.

09:27.626 --> 09:30.083
- How dare you threaten me?

09:27.626 --> 09:30.083
- It's just business.

09:30.751 --> 09:34.375
You take this money,

09:30.751 --> 09:34.375
you keep your mouth shut,

09:34.417 --> 09:36.918
and you and I will get along

09:34.417 --> 09:36.918
just fine.

09:37.459 --> 09:38.751
Do we understand each other?

09:38.792 --> 09:40.792
(fire crackling)

09:50.584 --> 09:51.792
(Michael): I made a mistake.

09:53.209 --> 09:54.751
O'Reilly's been selling

09:53.209 --> 09:54.751
Native women as country wives,

09:54.792 --> 09:56.626
offering 'em up as companions

09:54.792 --> 09:56.626
to traders with money to spend.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.292
- Like it or not,

09:56.667 --> 09:59.292
he's our link to Vanstone.

09:59.334 --> 10:01.209
- O'Reilly's got to go.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.000
- You were the one who said

10:01.250 --> 10:04.000
we cannot take Fort James

10:01.250 --> 10:04.000
without O'Reilly!

10:04.042 --> 10:05.417
Now you want to

10:04.042 --> 10:05.417
dump our plans because

10:05.459 --> 10:06.918
you heard some,

10:05.459 --> 10:06.918
some bad news about him?

10:06.959 --> 10:08.584
- I need Sokanon more than

10:06.959 --> 10:08.584
I need him!

10:08.626 --> 10:10.876
I don't get rid of him,

10:08.626 --> 10:10.876
I lose her.

10:10.918 --> 10:14.417
- I don't give a rat's arsehole

10:10.918 --> 10:14.417
about the trouble you're having

10:10.918 --> 10:14.417
with your country wife.

10:14.459 --> 10:16.042
- She's not a country wife.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.751
She's a hunter,

10:16.083 --> 10:18.751
she's a fighter,

10:16.083 --> 10:18.751
and she's a tracker,

10:18.792 --> 10:20.125
and we need her.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.000
- The Brown Brothers

10:21.667 --> 10:24.000
did not put our empire

10:21.667 --> 10:24.000
on the line

10:24.042 --> 10:26.959
so that you could make

10:24.042 --> 10:26.959
your candle, Michael.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.959
- It's not about that!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.626
It's about doing what we know

10:27.000 --> 10:28.626
is right!

10:28.667 --> 10:32.042
- The right thing to do

10:28.667 --> 10:32.042
is to get O'Reilly's men

10:28.667 --> 10:32.042
and do this now!

10:32.083 --> 10:34.500
Finish what we started -

10:32.083 --> 10:34.500
what you fuckin' started!

10:34.542 --> 10:38.250
Michael, I went behind

10:34.542 --> 10:38.250
my own brother's back because

10:34.542 --> 10:38.250
you convinced me that

10:38.292 --> 10:41.500
it was the right thing to do

10:38.292 --> 10:41.500
for the Brown Brothers

10:38.292 --> 10:41.500
to side with you!

10:42.626 --> 10:45.417
Or were you just pushing me

10:42.626 --> 10:45.417
about the whole time?

10:42.626 --> 10:45.417
- No!

10:45.792 --> 10:47.417
I meant what I said.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.834
I just didn't expect

10:48.000 --> 10:49.834
O'Reilly's business

10:48.000 --> 10:49.834
to undermine us,

10:49.876 --> 10:51.876
I didn't know

10:49.876 --> 10:51.876
what I was getting into

10:49.876 --> 10:51.876
with him.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.334
- Oh, I know the feeling.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.042
- Fine.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.209
I'll take care of it.

11:05.751 --> 11:07.042
- Good.

11:09.209 --> 11:11.000
But O'Reilly stays.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.459
(whispering): You head straight

11:16.209 --> 11:18.459
for the gate.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.250
I'll be right behind you.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.918
(slow, dramatic music)

11:35.459 --> 11:37.000
(indistinct background chatter)

11:53.083 --> 11:56.375
- Leave. Now.

11:53.083 --> 11:56.375
Go to the tipis by the gate.

11:56.876 --> 11:58.626
You will be safe

11:56.876 --> 11:58.626
until I come for you.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.083
(slow, intense music continues)

13:13.959 --> 13:15.334
(door closing)

13:20.667 --> 13:22.918
(grunting)

13:22.959 --> 13:24.250
(repeated stabbing, grunting)

13:24.292 --> 13:26.375
(muffled grunting)

13:26.417 --> 13:29.334
(grunting)

13:29.375 --> 13:31.167
(grunting continues)

13:34.584 --> 13:37.876
(wheezing)

13:37.918 --> 13:39.000
(grunting)

13:42.000 --> 13:43.834
(uptempo, dramatic music)

14:09.876 --> 14:13.334
- My Lord,

14:09.876 --> 14:13.334
Declan Harp is in the castle,

14:13.375 --> 14:16.667
and my men

14:13.375 --> 14:16.667
are currently occupied.

14:16.709 --> 14:21.209
Let me deploy your men,

14:16.709 --> 14:21.209
and I assure you,

14:16.709 --> 14:21.209
we will capture him.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.167
- You may deploy my men,

14:21.250 --> 14:24.167
but you had best be

14:21.250 --> 14:24.167
on your guard.

14:24.209 --> 14:26.459
- No, he'll be trying

14:24.209 --> 14:26.459
to find her.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.209
- It seems as likely

14:26.500 --> 14:29.209
he is coming for you

14:26.500 --> 14:29.209
as for her.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.542
Nonetheless, I shall warn

14:29.250 --> 14:31.542
the Captain of the Guard.

14:31.584 --> 14:36.667
- Please, ensure he understands

14:31.584 --> 14:36.667
that Declan Harp is mine.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.125
- Indeed.

14:43.792 --> 14:44.918
(music stopping, door opening)

14:48.584 --> 14:49.584
Madame.

14:51.584 --> 14:52.542
May I?

14:52.584 --> 14:54.250
- Please yourself.

14:57.751 --> 15:01.250
- Are you comfortable?

14:57.751 --> 15:01.250
- Is that why you came down here

14:57.751 --> 15:01.250
to speak with me?

15:02.667 --> 15:04.292
To see if I'm comfortable?

15:05.125 --> 15:08.417
- I have come to ensure

15:05.125 --> 15:08.417
that you are well protected.

15:08.459 --> 15:11.292
- I think you've come

15:08.459 --> 15:11.292
because you seek the truth.

15:12.959 --> 15:15.125
- Which is?

15:15.167 --> 15:19.500
- Lord Benton's personal hatred

15:15.167 --> 15:19.500
of Declan Harp led him to make

15:15.167 --> 15:19.500
terrible decisions.

15:20.459 --> 15:22.918
He put revenge

15:20.459 --> 15:22.918
ahead of HBC interests,

15:22.959 --> 15:26.417
and as a result,

15:22.959 --> 15:26.417
I saw a precipitous decline

15:22.959 --> 15:26.417
of conditions in Fort James.

15:26.459 --> 15:30.500
- I cannot fault a company man

15:26.459 --> 15:30.500
for zealously pursing

15:26.459 --> 15:30.500
a fugitive.

15:30.542 --> 15:34.667
- What Benton did

15:30.542 --> 15:34.667
to Harp's family is unutterable.

15:35.542 --> 15:39.334
Any human being who faced

15:35.542 --> 15:39.334
what Harp faced

15:35.542 --> 15:39.334
would be changed by it forever.

15:39.375 --> 15:43.000
- And if I were to concede

15:39.375 --> 15:43.000
that that were true...

15:44.125 --> 15:45.959
What difference would it make?

15:47.500 --> 15:50.667
- It would mean that you

15:47.500 --> 15:50.667
already know the truth.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.042
That Benton isn't just a threat

15:53.125 --> 15:56.042
to Harp,

15:56.667 --> 15:58.334
or to me for that matter.

15:59.334 --> 16:03.500
That he is, in fact,

15:59.334 --> 16:03.500
a liability to the HBC itself.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.459
You'd do far more good

16:04.000 --> 16:07.459
for the Company

16:04.000 --> 16:07.459
by getting rid of him

16:07.500 --> 16:10.375
than you ever could

16:07.500 --> 16:10.375
by pursuing Declan Harp.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.334
- I'm sorry.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.334
I wasn't honest with you.

16:26.042 --> 16:28.292
- I do not accept

16:26.042 --> 16:28.292
your apology.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.751
Because there is no need

16:29.125 --> 16:31.751
for one.

16:35.792 --> 16:39.334
You may think our time

16:35.792 --> 16:39.334
together was a transgression,

16:39.375 --> 16:43.209
but I thought it was wonderful.

16:44.792 --> 16:48.334
It felt honest to me.

17:18.584 --> 17:19.542
- Madame?

17:20.792 --> 17:22.667
- Ah, Mr. Pond,

17:20.792 --> 17:22.667
I was just coming to say hello.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.584
- Hello.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.417
- Have you received any company

17:24.626 --> 17:26.417
this evening?

17:27.584 --> 17:31.209
- No. I was just out

17:27.584 --> 17:31.209
for the evening,

17:27.584 --> 17:31.209
I'm just returning now.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.209
- Ah.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.209
- Is there something wrong?

17:33.250 --> 17:37.209
- No! No, no... It's just,

17:33.250 --> 17:37.209
there was someone about

17:33.250 --> 17:37.209
who shouldn't be.

17:37.250 --> 17:41.083
But I thought I saw him

17:37.250 --> 17:41.083
come up here.

17:49.542 --> 17:50.792
- Oh dear.

17:54.959 --> 17:56.876
Darling, look at me.

17:56.918 --> 18:01.250
Go downstairs with the crowd.

17:56.918 --> 18:01.250
You'll be safe there.

18:01.959 --> 18:04.292
I will look at the other rooms.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.334
Go.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.083
(Michael): I made

18:14.459 --> 18:16.083
a judgment call.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.083
- You're a lying selfish prick,

18:16.125 --> 18:18.083
Michael.

18:18.125 --> 18:21.375
You lied straight to my face,

18:18.125 --> 18:21.375
<i>partner!</i>

18:21.417 --> 18:23.584
- Malcolm, keep your voice down.

18:26.667 --> 18:30.083
Now, Michael,

18:26.667 --> 18:30.083
we can all be fools

18:26.667 --> 18:30.083
when we're in love,

18:30.125 --> 18:32.167
I understand that

18:30.125 --> 18:32.167
more than most,

18:32.209 --> 18:34.167
but trust is trust.

18:34.626 --> 18:37.417
I think that I speak

18:34.626 --> 18:37.417
for my new friend Malcolm

18:34.626 --> 18:37.417
when I say that

18:37.459 --> 18:39.417
I'm not sure that

18:37.459 --> 18:39.417
we can fucking trust you.

18:39.459 --> 18:41.459
- I got us the deal

18:39.459 --> 18:41.459
with the Lake Walkers, yeah?

18:41.959 --> 18:44.626
If I didn't give Sokanon

18:41.959 --> 18:44.626
what she wanted,

18:41.959 --> 18:44.626
it would have compromised that.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.834
- You don't give a pig shite

18:44.667 --> 18:47.834
about this, do you, eh?

18:44.667 --> 18:47.834
(Michael): What?

18:48.334 --> 18:51.459
- I will not follow you

18:48.334 --> 18:51.459
to a grave, Michael.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.876
- Malcolm, just calm down

18:51.500 --> 18:54.876
and listen to me for a second.

18:54.918 --> 18:59.751
- I'm sure that you can

18:54.918 --> 18:59.751
understand our apprehension.

18:54.918 --> 18:59.751
- Just trust me!

18:59.792 --> 19:02.667
If we keep Sokanon on our side,

18:59.792 --> 19:02.667
we keep the Lake Walkers.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.167
If we stick together

19:03.000 --> 19:06.167
and we keep O'Reilly's men

19:03.000 --> 19:06.167
on our side,

19:06.209 --> 19:07.876
we might actually

19:06.209 --> 19:07.876
make this happen.

19:08.334 --> 19:10.167
We're so close.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.500
- If this is the dish

19:12.751 --> 19:15.500
that we wish to serve,

19:15.542 --> 19:19.250
we have to use

19:15.542 --> 19:19.250
the sudden tragedy of

19:15.542 --> 19:19.250
Mr. O'Reilly's death

19:19.292 --> 19:21.584
to get his men to act now.

19:22.083 --> 19:23.375
They're already hot.

19:23.417 --> 19:25.626
We need to bring them

19:23.417 --> 19:25.626
to a rolling boil.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.542
- Let's fuckin' do it,

19:27.292 --> 19:29.542
then.

19:32.667 --> 19:36.876
- I need you to stay here.

19:32.667 --> 19:36.876
I don't want to have to

19:32.667 --> 19:36.876
look for you again.

19:44.626 --> 19:45.542
- It'll work.

19:51.042 --> 19:54.667
- You must do something

19:51.042 --> 19:54.667
about this, Mr. Mercer.

19:51.042 --> 19:54.667
It cannot go unpunished.

19:54.709 --> 19:55.876
- Who did it?

19:58.000 --> 19:58.959
- Michael Smyth.

20:00.876 --> 20:02.542
He was here, not an hour ago,

20:02.584 --> 20:05.500
and he threatened me harm

20:02.584 --> 20:05.500
if I didn't let him up there.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.751
I saw him walk up those stairs,

20:06.083 --> 20:09.751
and then I found O'Reilly dead.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.667
The Black Wolf is vicious.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.459
I didn't see it happen,

20:13.250 --> 20:15.459
but I know it to be true.

20:16.292 --> 20:20.375
- When Smyth shows up again,

20:16.292 --> 20:20.375
you keep him here

20:16.292 --> 20:20.375
and get word to me.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.417
I'll let the others know.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.417
- Yes.

20:39.375 --> 20:40.959
- Come live with me.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.584
- You move fast.

20:48.459 --> 20:50.959
I'm not asking you to do that,

20:48.459 --> 20:50.959
Douglas.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.667
- I'd do anything you asked.

20:55.209 --> 20:59.751
- I'm more than certain

20:55.209 --> 20:59.751
Miss Josephette would kick me

20:55.209 --> 20:59.751
out the door

20:59.792 --> 21:02.584
the moment you announced

20:59.792 --> 21:02.584
my arrival.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.584
- Hm...

21:03.834 --> 21:07.584
Luckily, it's my name

21:03.834 --> 21:07.584
that's on the deed.

21:08.959 --> 21:11.751
I decide who lives where.

21:14.626 --> 21:16.876
- I cannot come with you.

21:16.918 --> 21:22.083
- We've not been exactly

21:16.918 --> 21:22.083
discreet, in our meeting here.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.292
- Huh.

21:25.334 --> 21:29.584
- Samuel Grant is going to

21:25.334 --> 21:29.584
find out about it,

21:25.334 --> 21:29.584
and when he does,

21:30.792 --> 21:33.542
he's not going to be easy

21:30.792 --> 21:33.542
with you, Clenna.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.834
- That's my problem.

21:38.125 --> 21:39.667
I would not make it yours.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.876
- I cannot leave you here,

21:40.500 --> 21:42.876
with him.

21:44.876 --> 21:46.751
- I can't go with you.

21:53.876 --> 21:54.834
Not unless...

21:55.459 --> 21:56.834
- Unless what?

22:01.250 --> 22:06.334
- I was there, right after.

22:01.250 --> 22:06.334
I saw...

22:07.459 --> 22:10.334
Saw what he did to Elizabeth.

22:14.125 --> 22:18.334
- You...

22:14.125 --> 22:18.334
you-you saw him kill her?

22:18.375 --> 22:23.292
- No! No, I-I came in

22:18.375 --> 22:23.292
after it was done,

22:18.375 --> 22:23.292
after it was too late.

22:23.584 --> 22:26.876
(Douglas grunting)

22:23.584 --> 22:26.876
I would never have... have

22:23.584 --> 22:26.876
just watched him kill her.

22:26.918 --> 22:29.792
So uh, I-I w-w-was right

22:26.918 --> 22:29.792
to make your acquaintance,

22:29.834 --> 22:35.542
I was just... so stupid

22:29.834 --> 22:35.542
to have trusted you.

22:35.584 --> 22:37.751
- I did not mean to deceive you.

22:38.209 --> 22:39.834
Have you ever had

22:38.209 --> 22:39.834
to make a choice between

22:39.876 --> 22:42.125
doing what is right

22:39.876 --> 22:42.125
and staying alive?

22:42.167 --> 22:46.834
- The choice between living here

22:42.167 --> 22:46.834
with a murderer,

22:42.167 --> 22:46.834
or living on the streets?

22:46.876 --> 22:51.459
I know what I'd do.

22:46.876 --> 22:51.459
- If I hadn't stayed silent,

22:51.500 --> 22:55.918
I would surely have met

22:51.500 --> 22:55.918
the same fate as Elizabeth.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.375
All she did was insult him,

22:56.542 --> 22:59.375
for God's sake!

22:59.417 --> 23:02.375
I... I cannot imagine

22:59.417 --> 23:02.375
what he would do to me

23:02.417 --> 23:04.584
if he thought that

23:02.417 --> 23:04.584
I betrayed him for you.

23:04.626 --> 23:08.000
- Ah, and I thought she died

23:04.626 --> 23:08.000
because of a slight?

23:15.083 --> 23:16.834
- I know I have lost your trust.

23:17.542 --> 23:19.042
And your good faith.

23:20.250 --> 23:22.083
But there is something

23:20.250 --> 23:22.083
I can do for you.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.626
I can give you

23:25.834 --> 23:27.626
what you've wanted all along,

23:27.667 --> 23:30.125
I can give you

23:27.667 --> 23:30.125
what you came for

23:27.667 --> 23:30.125
in the first place.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.792
I am your proof, Douglas.

23:34.584 --> 23:36.584
For the magistrates,

23:34.584 --> 23:36.584
or the judges,

23:37.083 --> 23:41.083
or whoever it is

23:37.083 --> 23:41.083
that will help you see justice

23:37.083 --> 23:41.083
for Elizabeth.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.542
I am a witness--

23:45.584 --> 23:47.542
(suspenseful music)

23:48.334 --> 23:49.459
(She catches her breath.)

23:55.334 --> 23:59.876
(music tempo quickening)

24:12.918 --> 24:15.417
- In the morning,

24:12.918 --> 24:15.417
I will take you to

24:12.918 --> 24:15.417
the Lake Walkers.

24:15.459 --> 24:16.626
(soldier): Alright, men!

24:17.667 --> 24:20.083
(soldiers shouting indistinctly)

24:20.125 --> 24:22.083
- He's been discovered.

24:22.834 --> 24:24.250
Maybe you should go tonight.

24:27.042 --> 24:28.250
- How did you get here?

24:28.292 --> 24:29.334
(gun cocking)

24:29.375 --> 24:32.000
You will come with me, now.

24:35.209 --> 24:36.542
- Take her to Kamenna.

24:42.125 --> 24:45.834
- It looks like

24:42.125 --> 24:45.834
Mr. O'Reilly's men are

24:42.125 --> 24:45.834
keeping busy.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.918
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

24:56.709 --> 24:58.083
- Hello, Mr. Smyth.

24:58.125 --> 25:01.667
- Mr. O'Reilly would thank you,

24:58.125 --> 25:01.667
Mr. Mercer,

25:01.709 --> 25:04.167
for your swift justice

25:01.709 --> 25:04.167
in apprehending his killer.

25:04.209 --> 25:05.542
- I didn't kill him.

25:05.959 --> 25:09.167
- Imogen says she saw you.

25:05.959 --> 25:09.167
- Imogen's a liar.

25:09.209 --> 25:13.209
(whispering): You threatened me,

25:09.209 --> 25:13.209
now you've got what you deserve.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.292
- Michael Smyth.

25:18.751 --> 25:23.042
Thief. Murderer.

25:18.751 --> 25:23.042
Marauder of Fort James.

25:23.083 --> 25:26.667
You are guilty of the murder

25:23.083 --> 25:26.667
of Patrick O'Reilly.

25:26.709 --> 25:29.834
The punishment for your crime

25:26.709 --> 25:29.834
shall be death.

25:29.876 --> 25:34.125
The method of justice

25:29.876 --> 25:34.125
should be administered by those

25:29.876 --> 25:34.125
loyal to the deceased.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.751
- Mr. Mercer?

25:38.751 --> 25:40.459
- Get him readied

25:38.751 --> 25:40.459
for the stakes.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.709
- Excellent choice.

25:53.584 --> 25:55.042
- Miss Dolan, here...

25:57.083 --> 26:01.667
claims to be a witness for you,

25:57.083 --> 26:01.667
but she forgets that she is also

25:57.083 --> 26:01.667
a co-conspirator,

26:01.709 --> 26:03.626
in the eyes of the law.

26:05.250 --> 26:06.834
I mean, I suppose...

26:08.334 --> 26:10.125
that's what the courts

26:08.334 --> 26:10.125
would say,

26:10.918 --> 26:16.626
as someone who has

26:10.918 --> 26:16.626
mopped up blood and bones

26:10.918 --> 26:16.626
from our floor,

26:17.417 --> 26:20.918
and made arrangements

26:17.417 --> 26:20.918
to remove a body from our home.

26:25.459 --> 26:26.709
(sighing)

26:28.083 --> 26:29.125
You are nothing,

26:30.292 --> 26:31.959
and no better than a whore

26:32.000 --> 26:35.626
who's taken my good nature

26:32.000 --> 26:35.626
and generosity for granted.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.083
- You made me a whore,

26:37.125 --> 26:41.250
for you to flirt

26:37.125 --> 26:41.250
with your businessmen,

26:41.542 --> 26:44.125
and to make you look...

26:41.542 --> 26:44.125
normal.

26:44.459 --> 26:45.751
You used me,

26:45.792 --> 26:46.959
and threatened me--

26:45.792 --> 26:46.959
(glass shattering)

26:49.292 --> 26:54.292
- I'll not suffer these abuses

26:49.292 --> 26:54.292
in my own home.

26:49.292 --> 26:54.292
Get out, Douglas.

26:54.792 --> 26:56.584
So I can deal

26:54.792 --> 26:56.584
with this ungrateful cunt.

26:56.626 --> 27:02.125
- Do not... speak to her

26:56.626 --> 27:02.125
like that again.

27:05.584 --> 27:07.500
- I won't tell you

27:05.584 --> 27:07.500
a second time.

27:08.542 --> 27:12.000
Unless you wish to be reunited

27:08.542 --> 27:12.000
with your beloved Elizabeth.

27:12.709 --> 27:13.792
(yelling)

27:13.834 --> 27:15.709
- Not like this, Douglas!

27:15.751 --> 27:17.167
(glass shattering, grunting)

27:20.042 --> 27:21.792
(grunting)

27:21.834 --> 27:23.876
Stop it! Stop it!

27:31.209 --> 27:33.000
(dramatic music)

27:33.042 --> 27:34.167
Oh, oh...

27:37.709 --> 27:40.334
(grunting, whimpering)

27:43.709 --> 27:46.250
(dramatic music stops)

27:50.375 --> 27:51.375
Douglas!

27:53.542 --> 27:54.709
(sobbing)

27:57.375 --> 27:58.375
Douglas.

28:00.292 --> 28:02.375
(breathing quickly)

28:07.375 --> 28:08.876
(quivering breath)

28:14.709 --> 28:16.709
(fire crackling)

28:23.918 --> 28:25.250
- Let Sokanon go.

28:25.667 --> 28:26.792
She's done nothing wrong.

28:26.834 --> 28:29.250
- Let's get this fire started.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.083
- You will be next.

28:36.542 --> 28:37.792
- I'm sorry.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.125
- Pond,

28:43.500 --> 28:45.125
we need to do something.

28:48.876 --> 28:50.083
- Mr. Mercer!

28:51.709 --> 28:54.876
These are not the persons

28:51.709 --> 28:54.876
you seek for this.

28:55.834 --> 28:57.334
It was him.

28:57.375 --> 28:59.500
- You giddy wench, sod off!

28:59.918 --> 29:01.459
Light 'em up, Mercer.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.459
- Tell me what you know,

29:03.209 --> 29:05.459
Kahwihta.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.709
- Vanstone came to our room.

29:07.751 --> 29:09.667
He told me to leave.

29:09.709 --> 29:11.792
When he opened the door again,

29:12.500 --> 29:14.125
my husband was dead!

29:14.167 --> 29:16.876
- You're a fucking liar,

29:14.167 --> 29:16.876
you want to get

29:14.167 --> 29:16.876
roped up here too?

29:16.918 --> 29:20.083
- You know my love

29:16.918 --> 29:20.083
of Mr. O'Reilly.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.375
I know your affections for him.

29:22.417 --> 29:27.834
You must balance the scales

29:22.417 --> 29:27.834
with the man who really killed

29:22.417 --> 29:27.834
my husband.

29:27.876 --> 29:30.542
He wanted Mr. Smyth dead.

29:30.584 --> 29:34.292
He's using you for

29:30.584 --> 29:34.292
his own evil purpose.

29:30.584 --> 29:34.292
- She's lying, Mercer.

29:34.334 --> 29:36.751
I had nothing to do

29:34.334 --> 29:36.751
with O'Reilly's death.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.500
(Pond): I can corroborate!

29:38.542 --> 29:41.709
I heard Lieutenant Vanstone

29:38.542 --> 29:41.709
threaten Mr. O'Reilly tonight.

29:41.751 --> 29:47.167
- Please.

29:41.751 --> 29:47.167
Mr. Smyth is an honourable man.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.918
- You're gonna die, now.

29:49.959 --> 29:51.459
(crowd murmuring)

29:51.500 --> 29:52.751
Get off of me!

29:52.792 --> 29:54.876
I didn't fucking do it!

29:54.918 --> 29:57.375
(soft music)

30:11.792 --> 30:16.334
(no audible scream)

30:23.250 --> 30:25.500
(fire crackling)

30:49.792 --> 30:52.334
(soft footsteps echoing)

30:59.876 --> 31:02.918
(soft, eerie music)

31:57.959 --> 32:00.042
- You must be Declan Harp.

32:03.375 --> 32:04.417
- Where's Benton?

32:04.709 --> 32:05.667
- He is not far.

32:07.709 --> 32:09.542
Do you know who I am?

32:10.292 --> 32:11.083
- Fisher.

32:11.125 --> 32:13.334
- Lord Fisher, actually.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.709
- You're no Lord to me.

32:15.751 --> 32:17.834
- And you are remarkable.

32:17.876 --> 32:22.626
It is rare indeed to

32:17.876 --> 32:22.626
meet the man that

32:17.876 --> 32:22.626
more than matches the myth.

32:23.459 --> 32:26.626
You see,

32:23.459 --> 32:26.626
I know a great deal about

32:23.459 --> 32:26.626
who you are.

32:27.459 --> 32:29.292
About your family.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.417
I know more, perhaps,

32:30.083 --> 32:32.417
even than you do.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.334
- I doubt that.

32:35.459 --> 32:39.042
- Your Irish father died

32:35.459 --> 32:39.042
an unaccomplished Company man

32:39.083 --> 32:41.083
with no merits worthy of

32:39.083 --> 32:41.083
mention.

32:41.375 --> 32:47.209
Leaving you, a penniless,

32:41.375 --> 32:47.209
half-breed bastard,

32:41.375 --> 32:47.209
to be raised by savages.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.751
Yet, despite

32:47.792 --> 32:49.751
these disadvantages,

32:49.792 --> 32:52.167
you found favour with

32:49.792 --> 32:52.167
Lord Benton,

32:52.751 --> 32:56.250
who took you under his wing,

32:52.751 --> 32:56.250
and raised you as his own,

32:56.292 --> 33:01.334
helping you to become

32:56.292 --> 33:01.334
one of the most effective men

32:56.292 --> 33:01.334
in the entire Company.

33:02.459 --> 33:07.584
Then, inevitably,

33:02.459 --> 33:07.584
like father, like son,

33:02.459 --> 33:07.584
you impregnated a Native,

33:07.626 --> 33:10.417
and fathered

33:07.626 --> 33:10.417
another little bastard with her,

33:10.459 --> 33:13.459
prompting a sharp decline

33:10.459 --> 33:13.459
in your profitability.

33:13.500 --> 33:17.500
- He murdered my family.

33:13.500 --> 33:17.500
- As you knew he might, yes?

33:18.459 --> 33:19.667
Be honest.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.667
You always knew it was a risk,

33:21.083 --> 33:23.667
Mr. Harp, did you not?

33:24.500 --> 33:27.083
Lord Benton is not

33:24.500 --> 33:27.083
the only man you blame for

33:27.125 --> 33:29.292
the death of your family,

33:27.125 --> 33:29.292
is he?

33:29.876 --> 33:34.792
In the deep of night,

33:29.876 --> 33:34.792
when you dream their deaths

33:29.876 --> 33:34.792
over and over,

33:34.834 --> 33:36.667
you blame yourself.

33:37.542 --> 33:39.167
As you rightly should.

33:39.751 --> 33:44.250
After all, whose

33:39.751 --> 33:44.250
responsibility is it to

33:39.751 --> 33:44.250
safeguard a man's family

33:44.292 --> 33:46.292
if not the man himself?

33:46.584 --> 33:49.792
You failed to see

33:46.584 --> 33:49.792
what Lord Benton

33:46.584 --> 33:49.792
was truly capable of,

33:49.834 --> 33:54.042
because of your own

33:49.834 --> 33:54.042
desperate need for that

33:49.834 --> 33:54.042
which you never had...

33:54.542 --> 33:55.584
A father.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.083
And now,

33:59.209 --> 34:01.459
the family you could have had

33:59.209 --> 34:01.459
is gone,

34:01.959 --> 34:04.250
most likely burning in hell.

34:05.459 --> 34:09.209
So, with every throat you slit,

34:09.250 --> 34:15.250
you see Benton, and

34:09.250 --> 34:15.250
you pray to whatever savage god

34:09.250 --> 34:15.250
you think will listen,

34:15.292 --> 34:19.250
that your guilt will die

34:15.292 --> 34:19.250
behind the swift ribbon

34:15.292 --> 34:19.250
of blood.

34:19.292 --> 34:22.751
But by now, I am sure

34:19.292 --> 34:22.751
you know it won't.

34:23.417 --> 34:25.500
Do not despair, Declan.

34:27.334 --> 34:29.459
Salvation is still possible.

34:30.459 --> 34:35.751
I offer the chance of

34:30.459 --> 34:35.751
revenge and redemption

34:30.459 --> 34:35.751
at one fell swoop.

34:36.417 --> 34:41.584
Rejoin the Company

34:36.417 --> 34:41.584
- a senior position -

34:36.417 --> 34:41.584
with my patronage.

34:41.626 --> 34:44.751
Your testimony to

34:41.626 --> 34:44.751
Lord Benton's criminal acts

34:44.792 --> 34:48.417
will see him dangle from

34:44.792 --> 34:48.417
the end of a traitor's rope.

34:48.459 --> 34:51.417
With you, his executioner.

34:52.459 --> 34:56.417
Finally allowing us to

34:52.459 --> 34:56.417
conduct HBC business properly.

34:57.584 --> 34:58.542
After all,

34:59.959 --> 35:02.792
while people are being slain,

34:59.959 --> 35:02.792
no money is being made.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.167
- Money.

35:08.334 --> 35:11.167
You clearly have no idea

35:08.334 --> 35:11.167
what motivates me.

35:11.209 --> 35:12.626
- Perhaps.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.667
Do you enjoy rum, Mr. Harp?

35:23.292 --> 35:24.500
I must admit,

35:24.876 --> 35:26.918
it is not to my taste.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.125
Made from garbage.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.125
It's true.

35:30.167 --> 35:34.375
A spirit derived

35:30.167 --> 35:34.375
from the waste product

35:30.167 --> 35:34.375
of refining white sugar.

35:35.751 --> 35:39.292
It was

35:35.751 --> 35:39.292
the sugar plantation slaves

35:35.751 --> 35:39.292
that first distilled it,

35:39.334 --> 35:41.709
to ease their misery, no doubt.

35:42.334 --> 35:46.250
And now, this slave garbage

35:42.334 --> 35:46.250
is coveted the world round.

35:46.292 --> 35:49.500
Fortunes are being made

35:46.292 --> 35:49.500
on its prolific popularity.

35:50.167 --> 35:52.959
But at its heart,

35:50.167 --> 35:52.959
it is a dark spirit.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.626
Born from dirty, dangerous work

35:53.000 --> 35:56.626
being done by slaves

35:56.667 --> 35:59.918
who suffer terribly

35:56.667 --> 35:59.918
for their master's

35:56.667 --> 35:59.918
great benefit.

35:59.959 --> 36:01.918
- Make your goddamn point.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.959
- I happen to know of

36:02.375 --> 36:04.959
one such slave boy,

36:05.000 --> 36:09.667
who most likely still toils

36:05.000 --> 36:09.667
somewhere on a plantation

36:05.000 --> 36:09.667
as we speak.

36:11.792 --> 36:14.584
That young boy, Mr. Harp,

36:11.792 --> 36:14.584
is your son.

36:17.334 --> 36:22.959
Lord Benton did not have him

36:17.334 --> 36:22.959
killed, but instead

36:17.334 --> 36:22.959
sold him into slavery.

36:24.125 --> 36:25.125
- You lie.

36:26.626 --> 36:29.751
- Under such circumstances,

36:26.626 --> 36:29.751
it is natural to fear hope.

36:30.542 --> 36:35.667
But as a father myself,

36:30.542 --> 36:35.667
I give you my word, sir,

36:30.542 --> 36:35.667
it is true.

36:37.626 --> 36:38.918
Join me, Declan.

36:39.375 --> 36:41.584
Help me stop Lord Benton.

36:42.584 --> 36:43.834
Find your son.

36:47.459 --> 36:49.375
- I will never join you.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.626
- Pity.

36:55.334 --> 36:57.167
- Where the fuck is Benton?

36:57.209 --> 36:58.751
(door opening)

37:46.959 --> 37:48.459
- Back on top, eh?

37:50.209 --> 37:53.209
A drink for you, patsy.

37:50.209 --> 37:53.209
I'm surprised

37:50.209 --> 37:53.209
you don't have a man's shoe.

37:54.125 --> 37:58.292
- Say this after me, Mr. Brown:

37:54.125 --> 37:58.292
<i>À vous, à les vôtres,</i>

37:54.125 --> 37:58.292
<i>puis à ta santé.</i>

37:58.334 --> 38:02.626
-<i> À vous,</i> ah, fuck that!

37:58.334 --> 38:02.626
-<i> Voulez-vous coucher avec moi</i>

37:58.334 --> 38:02.626
<i>ce soir?</i>

38:03.000 --> 38:04.167
- Whoa! Jesus...

38:04.209 --> 38:06.709
(indistinct chatter)

38:07.834 --> 38:10.375
- What the hell

38:07.834 --> 38:10.375
are you all doing?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.417
- Lassi...

38:15.709 --> 38:19.042
I think you'd best

38:15.709 --> 38:19.042
make yourself scarce

38:15.709 --> 38:19.042
around here, eh?

38:20.667 --> 38:22.709
- You need to be gone

38:20.667 --> 38:22.709
by morning.

38:24.125 --> 38:25.459
- I'm not going anywhere.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.209
- You need to leave.

38:27.834 --> 38:30.500
- Where will I go?

38:27.834 --> 38:30.500
- Nobody cares.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.792
- I don't want to see you

38:31.042 --> 38:34.792
around here again.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.792
The ale house is ours, now.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.584
- If I were you, I'd get going.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.459
A lot can happen

38:39.250 --> 38:41.459
before the sun comes up.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.918
- And how are these men?

38:53.959 --> 38:56.459
- Amenable.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.459
- Good.

38:57.584 --> 38:59.834
- I, uh... must beg

38:57.584 --> 38:59.834
your forgiveness.

39:03.792 --> 39:05.542
- Thank you for listening

39:03.792 --> 39:05.542
to reason.

39:06.083 --> 39:08.626
We're gonna have to

39:06.083 --> 39:08.626
trust each other

39:06.083 --> 39:08.626
moving forward, Mercer.

39:10.375 --> 39:13.375
And um...

39:10.375 --> 39:13.375
I must demand something of you.

39:14.209 --> 39:18.167
I don't know what part you had

39:14.209 --> 39:18.167
in O'Reilly's business

39:14.209 --> 39:18.167
of buying and selling women,

39:18.209 --> 39:21.834
but whatever it was,

39:18.209 --> 39:21.834
it's over now.

39:23.083 --> 39:25.000
I'll build you a church

39:23.083 --> 39:25.000
if that's what you desire,

39:25.042 --> 39:27.209
I won't disconnect you

39:25.042 --> 39:27.209
from your faith, but...

39:27.792 --> 39:30.125
marrying off unwilling women,

39:27.792 --> 39:30.125
that's forbidden now.

39:30.584 --> 39:32.626
We're gonna be everything that

39:30.584 --> 39:32.626
the HBC is not.

39:41.125 --> 39:42.083
And you.

39:44.751 --> 39:47.918
You who remain loyal to

39:44.751 --> 39:47.918
the Hudson's Bay Company,

39:48.959 --> 39:50.042
you can leave.

39:50.834 --> 39:51.918
And never return.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.834
Find a new station,

39:53.125 --> 39:54.834
forget this one existed.

39:54.876 --> 39:58.834
The HBC flag

39:54.876 --> 39:58.834
will no longer fly

39:54.876 --> 39:58.834
above Fort James.

39:59.751 --> 40:01.918
For those

39:59.751 --> 40:01.918
smart enough to see that

40:01.959 --> 40:06.751
your loyalty to the Company

40:01.959 --> 40:06.751
will result in nothing but

40:01.959 --> 40:06.751
death, starvation,

40:06.792 --> 40:07.584
and poverty,

40:08.918 --> 40:10.209
by putting you at the mercy

40:08.918 --> 40:10.209
of madmen in charge,

40:10.250 --> 40:12.250
like Vanstone,

40:10.250 --> 40:12.250
and Benton before him,

40:12.292 --> 40:14.125
this is your chance,

40:15.709 --> 40:18.042
to sign on,

40:15.709 --> 40:18.042
and join a new company.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.459
(indistinct chattering)

40:28.751 --> 40:29.792
A toast!

40:32.542 --> 40:34.083
To you, brave men.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.209
To us,

40:39.459 --> 40:41.751
the North West Company!

40:41.792 --> 40:45.083
(cheering)

40:45.125 --> 40:48.584
(soft, sombre music)

41:15.834 --> 41:19.167
- I don't suppose he took you up

41:15.834 --> 41:19.167
on your offer?

41:20.125 --> 41:21.751
- No, Archibald.

41:22.167 --> 41:23.667
He did not.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
- Now tell me the truth.

41:26.876 --> 41:30.334
You must have been

41:26.876 --> 41:30.334
just a little tempted?

41:31.042 --> 41:34.834
The prospect of

41:31.042 --> 41:34.834
taking charge in the New World.

41:36.459 --> 41:38.834
Like your own little fiefdom.

41:39.751 --> 41:41.626
- I don't think the way you do.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.834
- No... I suppose not.

41:46.542 --> 41:48.459
Had you thought the way I do,

41:48.500 --> 41:52.667
it would have been

41:48.500 --> 41:52.667
much more difficult to trap you

41:48.500 --> 41:52.667
the way we have.

41:53.417 --> 41:57.709
Or all those poor friends

41:53.417 --> 41:57.709
of yours who've died

41:53.417 --> 41:57.709
because of you.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.209
Was it worth it?

42:01.667 --> 42:05.250
And even now,

42:01.667 --> 42:05.250
at this very moment,

42:05.292 --> 42:11.292
your few remaining friends

42:05.292 --> 42:11.292
engage in a futile battle

42:05.292 --> 42:11.292
with my men.

42:13.876 --> 42:18.709
Once they learn of your demise,

42:13.876 --> 42:18.709
they will lose the will

42:13.876 --> 42:18.709
to fight.

42:19.584 --> 42:22.209
And they too, will die.

42:23.417 --> 42:24.959
And for what?

42:25.584 --> 42:30.334
This futile attempt to

42:25.584 --> 42:30.334
challenge me,

42:30.375 --> 42:32.626
and spirit Miss Emberly away?

42:39.500 --> 42:40.918
Well, tell me, son,

42:42.375 --> 42:44.209
how does it feel

42:45.417 --> 42:49.792
to have failed so abysmally?

42:52.667 --> 42:54.751
Choose your words carefully,

42:56.209 --> 42:58.918
or they will be your last.

42:59.751 --> 43:00.834
(footsteps approaching)

43:01.292 --> 43:02.334
- Lord Fisher!

43:08.918 --> 43:10.792
Lord Fisher, put a stop to this.

43:16.667 --> 43:18.834
(soft music)

43:18.876 --> 43:21.292
- Is my son still alive?

43:27.959 --> 43:29.042
(gasping)

43:29.250 --> 43:30.292
(choking)

43:52.250 --> 43:53.792
Let's get it over with.

43:54.250 --> 43:55.209
(knife clinking)

43:59.918 --> 44:03.500
- As I said,

43:59.918 --> 44:03.500
this man was a criminal.

44:04.417 --> 44:07.876
You have rid me of him

44:04.417 --> 44:07.876
to the great benefit

44:04.417 --> 44:07.876
of the Company.

44:09.125 --> 44:12.334
Nonetheless, you have

44:09.125 --> 44:12.334
murdered a Lord

44:09.125 --> 44:12.334
in his own home.

44:14.167 --> 44:16.500
You will be pursued

44:14.167 --> 44:16.500
to the ends of the Earth.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.167
Wherever should your path cross

44:17.000 --> 44:22.167
with that of Company men,

44:17.000 --> 44:22.167
or those of the Crown,

44:22.918 --> 44:24.584
you will be shown no quarter.

44:26.500 --> 44:30.667
For helping me, in your own way,

44:26.500 --> 44:30.667
to achieve that

44:26.500 --> 44:30.667
which I otherwise could not,

44:30.709 --> 44:35.209
I shall afford you

44:30.709 --> 44:35.209
a brief head-start

44:30.709 --> 44:35.209
before deploying my men.

44:36.375 --> 44:37.959
Our account is settled.

44:39.834 --> 44:43.250
Know that the next time we meet,

44:39.834 --> 44:43.250
Declan Harp,

44:44.459 --> 44:45.792
I shall destroy you.

44:45.834 --> 44:48.042
(soft music continues)

45:20.918 --> 45:22.125
(Grace sniffling)

45:24.834 --> 45:26.000
(softly): Go.
