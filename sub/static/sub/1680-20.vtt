00:02.800 --> 00:05.000
<i>??? of the cab ride</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:06.800
<i>that changed my life.</i>

00:07.100 --> 00:09.500
<i>I know it sounds crazy,
but for all I know</i>

00:09.500 --> 00:12.900
<i>my life would be very different
if I had taken, say...</i>

00:12.900 --> 00:14.400
<i>that cab.</i>

00:15.700 --> 00:17.000
<i>Or that cab.</i>

00:17.900 --> 00:18.900
<i>God knows
what would have happened</i>

00:18.900 --> 00:21.000
<i>if I had gotten into that cab.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:27.000
<i>I took this cab.</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:29.700
<i>And it changed my whole life.</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:39.700
<i>But first, we need
to back up a little.</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
Hey.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.300
Is there any beer in the fridge?

00:43.300 --> 00:44.800
It's 10:00 in
the morning.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.200
Grab me one.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
So,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.800
something bad
just happened.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.900
Stella and I were out
having breakfast.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.700
So, my sister broke up
with her boyfriend.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.900
Well, I can finally say it.

00:57.900 --> 00:58.900
I hated that guy!

00:58.900 --> 01:00.500
Everything out
of his mouth is,

01:00.500 --> 01:02.000
"I'm a vegan.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.600
"Fish feel pain.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.700
I'm never constipated. "

01:05.700 --> 01:07.100
The guy's an idiot.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.100
Actually, she's
marrying him.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.400
I just wanted
your honest opinion.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.500
He's actually a really nice guy.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.500
I think there's a wisdom to...

01:17.100 --> 01:18.900
Anyway, they picked
a date, so, uh,

01:19.100 --> 01:19.900
you want to come with me,

01:19.900 --> 01:21.200
so that we can laugh
our asses off

01:21.200 --> 01:23.800
as we watch him walk
barefoot down the aisle in a hemp tuxedo?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.100
Yeah, sure. When is it?

01:25.100 --> 01:26.800
Uh, first weekend
in November.

01:27.400 --> 01:27.800
Is that 

01:27.800 --> 01:28.700
the something bad?

01:28.700 --> 01:30.800
That she invited you
to a wedding?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.000
Six months from now.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.200
As in we'll be together
six months from now.

01:35.200 --> 01:35.800
Do you guys
remember

01:35.800 --> 01:37.200
Barney's whole thing
about making plans

01:37.200 --> 01:38.300
in a relationship?

01:38.900 --> 01:40.200
Fourth row.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
Ted, no.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.100
You're violating
the date-time continuum.

01:44.100 --> 01:44.800
You never make

01:44.800 --> 01:46.400
plans with a girl further
in the future

01:46.400 --> 01:48.400
than the amount of time
you've been going out.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.200
You've been dating this girl
for, what, two weeks?

01:50.200 --> 01:53.400
No, you're not taking her to a
Springsteen concert in January.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.800
By that time you won't even
remember this Robin girl's name.

01:59.300 --> 02:02.000
Ugh, man, I love Springsteen!

02:02.000 --> 02:04.800
He's like the American
Bryan Adams.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.000
Well...

02:06.900 --> 02:08.199
But Barney had a point.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.000
As soon as she started talking
about the wedding,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.200
it freaked me out.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.100
Oh, that sounds
like so much fun.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.000
Mmm. So I get to look forward to it

02:15.000 --> 02:16.600
for six months.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.200
Which is twice as long
as we've been dating.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.200
Uh-oh.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.100
I'm sure
your daughter Lucy'll come

02:22.100 --> 02:25.100
so it'll be like a...
a family trip.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.100
Our first trip
as our funny little family.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.400
So that... that'll
be super-exciting.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.100
Oh, boy.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.000
Man, they crank up the heat
in these places.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.900
What's going on, Ted?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.100
We need to talk.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.300
Oh. Oh. Oh.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.900
"We need to talk"?

02:42.900 --> 02:46.000
There's only two situations
where you say that to someone

02:46.000 --> 02:47.500
and unless you're pregnant,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.700
it sounds like you
broke up with her.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.400
Yeah, I did.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.200
So how did she take it?

02:54.200 --> 02:55.000
Um...

02:55.500 --> 02:57.600
I'm only trying
to be honest with you.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.200
You know, Ted.
I have to go to work.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
Stella, can we just...

03:01.200 --> 03:03.200
I d't want to leave it
like this.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.600
No, Ted, it's okay.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.200
We're good.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.700
Ow!

03:09.700 --> 03:11.400
Look, I know it sounds rough,

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
but Stella's a mom.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.100
I have to be responsible.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.700
If I'm having these feelings now,

03:15.700 --> 03:17.200
what if they don't go away?

03:17.200 --> 03:18.700
What if they just get worse
and worse

03:18.700 --> 03:20.900
d six months from now,
I break up with her

03:20.900 --> 03:23.400
over tofu salmon
at her sister's wedding?

03:23.400 --> 03:24.400
I can't do that to her.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.800
And I definitely can't do that

03:25.800 --> 03:27.200
to her daughter.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.000
It sucks, but I'm being
the good guy here.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.400
This is the right decision.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.900
<i>Which brings me back
to the cab ride.</i>

03:40.400 --> 03:42.700
Hello, may I speak
with Marshall Eriksen?

05:03.100 --> 05:05.100
???t believe this.
So you're totally fine.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.300
No, I'm not fine.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.600
I made the biggest mistake
of my life.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
I want Stella back.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.400
I've left her like ten messages,
but her phone's off.

05:12.400 --> 05:12.900
She's at that

05:12.900 --> 05:15.200
arcade Kiddie Funland
with her daughter.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.000
Please.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.800
Let me go to Kiddie Funland.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.700
You can say that
all you want, buddy,

05:20.700 --> 05:22.600
but you're not getting
any morphine.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.700
No, I'm serious.
I got to get out of here.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.000
You're not going anywhere
until we get the tests back.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.300
You could have
internal bleeding.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.400
Your brain could be all full
of blood.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.900
Think that's good for it?

05:31.900 --> 05:33.100
ain't.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.200
This sucks.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
This sucks. This sucks.
Are you...

05:36.200 --> 05:37.800
are you kidding me?

05:38.000 --> 05:38.900
You walked away

05:38.900 --> 05:41.500
from a car accident
without a scratch.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.600
A miracle took place
today.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.400
Oh, here we go.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.300
You don't think
this was a miracle?

05:47.300 --> 05:49.700
There's no such thing
as miracles.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.800
March 2006,
MacLaren's Bar.

05:53.700 --> 05:54.200
Oh.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.000
That's terrible.
Gentle.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.600
That's in!
Gentle.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.000
Ow.
Here we go.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.700
Hey!

06:01.900 --> 06:02.500
Bravo.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.900
Cheers...

06:03.900 --> 06:05.200
Mm-hmm.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.000
No... way.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.400
That did not just happen.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.700
Am I dead?

06:19.100 --> 06:20.600
Miracle!

06:20.800 --> 06:23.100
A pencil went up Barney's nose,

06:23.100 --> 06:25.100
and you call it a miracle.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.400
Well, do you have a better
explanation for it?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.900
A drunk jackass
with a box of pencils?

06:29.900 --> 06:32.200
A drunk jackass
called "God!"

06:32.200 --> 06:35.000
And a box of pencils
called "destiny!"

06:36.000 --> 06:38.800
Speaking of Barney,
I should give him a call.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.400
Why? We're not friends anymore.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.600
You'd want to know if
thisappened to him.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.500
Go for Barney.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.800
Hey, Barney.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.700
Listen, I have something
to tell you.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.200
Oh, boy, here we go.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.400
I've been waiting for this one.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.600
You talked to Robin.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.100
She told you
what's under the hood

06:55.100 --> 06:57.300
and you want to take it
for a spin yourself.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.400
Not even if you boiled it
in detergent.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.300
It's about Ted.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.400
Ted?

07:04.300 --> 07:06.100
My former best friend Ted

07:06.100 --> 07:07.900
who I asked you never
to mention to me again?

07:07.900 --> 07:08.900
Yeah.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.600
He's been in a car accident.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.200
He's at Saint Anthony's
hospital.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.300
Everything's...

07:14.400 --> 07:16.600
No, I understand.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.800
You've got that important thing.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.600
Okay.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.000
Oh, of course

07:22.000 --> 07:23.500
I'll tell him you love him.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.600
Okay.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.100
Suit up!

07:26.500 --> 07:28.800
He is always saying stuff
like that!

07:29.300 --> 07:31.100
He hung up, didn't he?
Yeah.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.000
See, I told you.
We're not friends anymore.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.700
??????

07:40.100 --> 07:41.700
What did he say?

07:42.600 --> 07:44.600
Ah, a hundred and thir... What?

07:44.600 --> 07:45.300
You...

07:46.900 --> 07:48.400
I'm coming, Ted.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.600
So, what made you change
your mind about Stella?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.000
Well, I was in the cab,
and the car was coming at me,

07:56.300 --> 07:58.400
<i>and you know how they say
that your whole life flashes</i>

07:58.400 --> 08:00.700
<i>before your eyes
in a near-death experience?</i>

08:00.700 --> 08:01.900
<i>It doesn't.</i>

08:02.100 --> 08:03.500
<i>You don't see everything.</i>

08:03.700 --> 08:05.600
<i>Just the things you love.</i>

08:09.000 --> 08:10.100
I realized in that moment

08:10.100 --> 08:12.400
that Stella is the most
important thing in my life

08:12.400 --> 08:13.700
and-and I have to get her back.

08:13.700 --> 08:14.700
Aw!

08:14.700 --> 08:15.800
Miracle!

08:15.800 --> 08:17.100
Very sweet.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.000
Very romantic.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.600
Not a miracle.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.900
July 1999.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.200
Kennedy Airport.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.000
So, did you enjoy...

08:29.100 --> 08:30.700
Amsterdam?

08:30.700 --> 08:31.700
No.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.000
Nothing illegal.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.200
Paintings.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.000
All right,
Bob Marley.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Let's have a
conversation.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.700
Shift change.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.100
Oh, Amsterdam.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.300
All right.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.100
Float on through, brother.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.200
Miracle!

09:03.600 --> 09:05.100
Don't you go
into the light!

09:05.100 --> 09:06.400
Don't you do it!

09:07.100 --> 09:08.100
Hey, Mosby,

09:08.100 --> 09:09.700
you got a visitor.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.600
Hey, guys.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.000
Hey. Hey. Hey.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.400
Can you guys, uh,
give us a minute?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
Stella, before you
say anytng...

09:30.100 --> 09:31.300
I love you.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.900
I love you, too.

09:33.200 --> 09:33.900
Can we just forget about...

09:33.900 --> 09:35.600
It's forgotten.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.100
Is this your chart?

09:40.300 --> 09:41.400
Okay.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.900
Uh-huh.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.800
Everything looks good.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.500
I think you can handle it.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.800
Handle what?

09:52.100 --> 09:54.400
Aww! Aww! Aww!

09:54.400 --> 09:55.300
This morning

09:55.300 --> 09:56.500
he dumped her and now

09:56.500 --> 09:59.000
she's dry-humping him
on a hospital bed.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.000
Miracle!
Yeah,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.600
you know, I bet
if you call up the Vatican,

10:02.600 --> 10:04.800
they will tell you that most
of their certified miracles

10:04.800 --> 10:06.900
involve dry-humping, so.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.100
April 2008.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.200
Lily's kindergarten classroom.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.600
You're gonna go in there

10:13.600 --> 10:15.100
and beg
for your old job back?

10:15.100 --> 10:16.300
That's crazy.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.200
You hated it there.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.300
I- I know, the job market is
just really bad right now.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.700
Hey, kids,

10:23.700 --> 10:26.600
who wants Uncle Marshall
to get his old job back?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.900
y

10:28.900 --> 10:29.600
They'll cheer

10:29.600 --> 10:32.100
for anything
if you say it like that.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.000
Kids, a super tanker

10:34.000 --> 10:36.300
spilled five million
gallons of oil

10:36.300 --> 10:38.700
off the coast of Alaska
this morning!

10:38.700 --> 10:41.100
y

10:43.300 --> 10:44.500
<i>Hello, Marshall.</i>

10:44.500 --> 10:45.200
Mr. Hewitt,

10:45.200 --> 10:47.000
I came here to apologize.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.700
I'm going to go
grab some more glue.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.400
Will you watch them for a sec?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.500
Of course.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.000
Leaving Nicholson, Hewitt,
and West was a huge mistake,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.900
and I can see that now.

10:57.900 --> 10:58.500
So...

10:58.800 --> 11:00.200
who wants to see the big guy

11:00.200 --> 11:02.100
put on these tiny hats?

11:02.100 --> 11:04.400
y

11:04.400 --> 11:07.000
My behavior was disrespectful.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.900
It was unprofessional.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.900
I'm a pilgrim.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.400
I know it looks like
I have a tiny hat,

11:13.400 --> 11:17.700
but in reality, I have
an abnormally large head!

11:19.500 --> 11:22.000
I was going through
a stressful time.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.400
I wasn't getting enough sleep.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.400
Fourscore and seven years ago,

11:28.400 --> 11:32.100
I had a great, big giant head!

11:33.400 --> 11:34.800
I had just bought an apartment,

11:34.800 --> 11:36.500
and there were some problems.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.300
I- I don't want to bore you
with the details.

11:39.300 --> 11:43.600
I only regret that I have
but one giant head

11:43.600 --> 11:45.800
to give for my country.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.100
Sir, if you could just see
your way into giving me

11:50.100 --> 11:52.600
one more chance, I promise... Marshall.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.800
I'm willing to give this
a second chance.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
I remember my

11:55.800 --> 11:58.000
first years as an attorney.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
Why, I don't know how
many hours I spent.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.000
I don't think
I ever left...

12:02.000 --> 12:03.300
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

12:03.600 --> 12:05.300
<i>I have lice.</i>

12:05.300 --> 12:07.500
<i>Those little bastards
gave me lice.</i>

12:07.500 --> 12:08.800
<i>God, it itches.</i>

12:08.800 --> 12:09.800
<i>Don't scratch it.</i>

12:09.800 --> 12:10.800
<i>You'll look like a fool.</i>

12:10.800 --> 12:12.200
<i>You'll never get your job back.</i>

12:12.400 --> 12:15.600
<i>Okay, you can scratch,
but just make it subtle.</i>

12:16.400 --> 12:18.000
<i>Okay, that's not working.</i>

12:18.000 --> 12:20.300
<i>, sweet, sharp corner
of the desk,</i>

12:20.300 --> 12:23.400
<i>how I long to rub
my infested scalp against you.</i>

12:24.500 --> 12:28.400
I was, um... just, uh...

12:29.400 --> 12:30.800
You okay, Eriksen?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.700
Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.100
I am good.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.300
Continue.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.000
<i>Mind over matter.</i>

12:38.000 --> 12:40.600
<i>There are no lice in my hair...</i>

12:40.600 --> 12:41.800
<i>laying eggs,</i>

12:41.800 --> 12:43.700
<i>burrowing into my scalp,</i>

12:43.700 --> 12:46.100
eating their way all the way
down to my brain!

12:46.100 --> 12:47.600
I have lice!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.700
"Lice"?! Lice! Get out!

12:49.700 --> 12:51.300
Get out of my office!

12:52.700 --> 12:53.600
We've got lice!

12:53.600 --> 12:55.200
Everybody out of the building.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.400
If it weren't for the lice,

12:57.400 --> 12:58.700
I would have gotten my job back,

12:58.700 --> 13:00.900
and I would have been
working there when,

13:00.900 --> 13:03.400
<i>two weeks later, the Securities
and Exchange Commission</i>

13:03.400 --> 13:04.700
<i>came a-knocking.</i>

13:04.900 --> 13:06.700
God sent those lice to my head

13:06.700 --> 13:09.300
like he sent
the locusts to Egypt:

13:09.300 --> 13:12.000
to liberate me
from corporate bondage.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.400
Miracle.

13:14.900 --> 13:15.400
Hey, guys.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.100
Oh, I'm just so glad

13:17.100 --> 13:19.500
you and Ted are back together. Yeah.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.600
Wait, um, what do you mean
"back together"?

13:22.600 --> 13:25.800
Well, you know,
since you guys broke up.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.700
What? Oh, no.

13:27.700 --> 13:28.800
It was just a small fight.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.300
That wasn't a breakup.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.800
Was that a breakup?
Did he think that was a breakup?

13:35.500 --> 13:36.500
What?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.500
Son of a bitch!

13:44.100 --> 13:45.700
That was a breakup. Wasn't it?

13:45.700 --> 13:47.100
You broke up with me.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.400
Yeah.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.000
I didn't know that
that was a breakup.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.200
Are you kidding?

13:52.200 --> 13:53.700
I- I said, "I feel awful. "

13:53.700 --> 13:55.300
You said, "We're good. "

13:55.300 --> 13:56.800
Then you got up and left.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.700
Yeah, I said, "We're good,"

13:58.700 --> 14:00.300
as in "We're good. "

14:00.300 --> 14:01.700
Like when the waiter
comes around and asks

14:01.700 --> 14:04.100
if you want any more muffins,
and you say, "We're good. "

14:04.100 --> 14:07.700
Exactly, and I took
that "We're good" to mean

14:07.700 --> 14:08.800
you didn't want any more

14:08.800 --> 14:11.100
metaphorical
relationship muffins.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.000
This is crazy.

14:13.000 --> 14:13.800
Forget about all that.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.500
That was a whole
life-changing car accident ago.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.100
I love you.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.900
I don't want to break up.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.000
But you did.

14:21.000 --> 14:21.900
You did want to.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.600
And if you had
those feelings once,

14:23.600 --> 14:24.800
then you're going
to have those feelings again,

14:24.800 --> 14:26.300
and you're going
to keep on having them.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.100
And I can't count
on that car to hit you

14:28.100 --> 14:29.400
every time you do.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.200
What are you saying?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.000
I'm saying...

14:33.200 --> 14:34.800
you wanted your breakup,

14:34.800 --> 14:35.700
you got it.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.900
What?! Stella, wait!

14:36.900 --> 14:39.500
No, you know what, Ted?
???

14:47.800 --> 14:51.200
So you broke up with her
and she didn't know it?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.200
Apparently.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.900
And you actually said,
"I want to break up"?

14:54.900 --> 14:55.900
No, of course not.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.100
Who says "I want to break up"?

14:57.100 --> 14:58.700
That's a horrible thing to say.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.000
Well, that's true.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.200
Hello?

15:05.200 --> 15:06.800
Hi, Ted Mosby?
We have you

15:06.800 --> 15:10.600
listed as the emergency contact
for Barney Stinson.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.500
What is it?

15:12.500 --> 15:14.400
<i>What it was was this.</i>

15:21.900 --> 15:24.600
I made it.
I made it!

15:32.700 --> 15:33.900
Dude, I...

15:33.900 --> 15:37.000
I can't believe you ran
all the way up here.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.000
Jeez. Flatter yourself much?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.000
What an ego

15:41.000 --> 15:42.400
on this guy.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.600
Um, I was up
in this part of town

15:44.600 --> 15:46.300
because I had to attend

15:46.300 --> 15:49.700
a very important
international business meeting.

15:50.100 --> 15:50.700
If you're here

15:50.700 --> 15:54.300
to come crawling back,
just save it.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.600
I'm doing awesome without you.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.500
Even br now,
'cause I can play

15:58.500 --> 16:00.600
the sympathy card
with the females.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.700
And BTW,

16:02.700 --> 16:05.900
there's one bone downstairs
that ain't broken.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.400
Marshall,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.700
you know what I'm talking about.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.700
Up top!

16:11.900 --> 16:12.900
Hup!

16:14.000 --> 16:14.800
Are you sure?

16:14.800 --> 16:17.600
Yeah, dude. Why do y think
I had them set it this way?

16:18.700 --> 16:19.600
Okay.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.600
Ow!

16:24.400 --> 16:26.000
Worth it.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.400
Barney, you, uh...

16:32.000 --> 16:33.500
Yocould've died.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.600
Ted, I'm sorry
I broke the bro code.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.600
No, I'm-I'm sorry.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.900
Ted, can we be friends again?

16:43.900 --> 16:47.100
Barney, come on, we're...
we're more than friends.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.900
We're brothers.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.800
You're my brother, Ted.
You're my

16:51.800 --> 16:53.300
brother, Barney.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.200
Did you hear that, Marshall?

16:56.200 --> 16:57.700
We're brothers now.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.200
Marshall's
my brother, too.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.300
We're all brothers.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.200
Yeah, but I'm your
best brother, right?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.200
<i>And that's how
your Uncle Barney</i>

17:06.200 --> 17:07.500
<i>and I buried the hatchet.</i>

17:07.500 --> 17:10.099
<i>It got pretty mushy
and embarrassing after that.</i>

17:10.099 --> 17:11.400
<i>Let's skip ahead.</i>

17:11.599 --> 17:13.500
I had to look away
because if I watched

17:13.500 --> 17:15.300
what the paramedics
were about to do,

17:15.300 --> 17:16.700
I would have passed out.

17:17.000 --> 17:17.800
Then they took out this

17:17.800 --> 17:21.599
electric blade thing
and I kept thinking,

17:21.599 --> 17:24.099
"This isn't happening.
This isn't happening. "

17:24.099 --> 17:26.400
Oh, my God.
What did they cut?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.400
My suit.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.500
My beautiful suit.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.800
But you're alive,
and, and Ted's alive.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.500
This is amazing!

17:37.000 --> 17:39.300
Two miracles in one day.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.500
What is the matter with you?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.700
How can you possibly
be this cynical?!

17:45.700 --> 17:46.800
You want to know?
Yeah.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.200
You really want to know?
Yeah!

17:48.900 --> 17:50.300
Fine.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.200
When I was a kid,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.700
I had this dog,
Sir Scratchawan.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.000
Anyway, Sir Scratchawan
got really old,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.700
so my parents decided
to put him down.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.400
<i>It was the toughest day
of my young life.</i>

18:04.400 --> 18:08.400
Good-byI love you.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.900
And when they took
him to the vet,

18:11.900 --> 18:14.500
he told them that
earlier that very day,

18:14.500 --> 18:16.400
he had learned about
an experimental procedure

18:16.400 --> 18:19.700
called a canine/testudine
cerebro-xenograft.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Ever heard of it?

18:21.000 --> 18:21.700
No.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.700
Well, it saved
Sir Scratchawan's life.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.100
He lived another
seven years.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.400
Miracle.
Except for one...

18:28.400 --> 18:30.700
kind of big side effect
from the surgery.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.900
SiScratchawan!

18:32.900 --> 18:34.800
Welcome home!

18:37.100 --> 18:38.900
He turned into a turtle.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.100
I know. It's weird, right?

18:42.100 --> 18:44.000
Apparently, a very common
complication

18:44.000 --> 18:47.400
from canine/testudine
cerebro-xenografts.

18:47.700 --> 18:50.700
And he didn't seem to remember
any of his old tricks.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.700
Go get it, Scratchy.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.200
Go get it!

18:55.200 --> 18:57.100
Go get it! Get it!

18:57.100 --> 18:58.200
Go get it, Scratchy.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.400
Go get it.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.500
How long was it before...?

19:03.500 --> 19:05.600
Longer than
I'm proud of, Lily.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.800
Longer than I'm proud of.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.600
And that's when I realized

19:10.600 --> 19:12.500
miracles ain't real.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.600
Excuse me.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.300
Mosby, you're still here?

19:18.300 --> 19:20.900
Your tests came back,
like, an hour ago. You're fine.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.800
Are you kidding me?
Why didn't you tell me?!

19:22.800 --> 19:23.900
I'm sorry.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.200
I guess it was rude of me
to keep resuscitating that guy

19:26.200 --> 19:28.500
with a rake sticking out
of his chest.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.400
Um, I have to go right now.
Barney, I...

19:31.800 --> 19:32.800
Go.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.300
Run, Ted. Run.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.700
If there's anything I've taught
you over the years, it's...

19:38.700 --> 19:40.900
Barney, he left.
Oh.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.000
Hey, Ted said that right
before the accident,

19:44.000 --> 19:45.500
his life flashed
before his eyes.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.200
You know,
all the stuff he loves.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.100
Did that happen to you?
Oh, yeah.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.900
I know what he saw: boobs.
Scotch.

19:52.100 --> 19:52.900
And money.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.500
Suits.
A suit of money.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.900
A suit of boobs.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.900
A giant boob wearing
a suit of money.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.900
And the boob is
lactating scotch.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.500
I guess that's pretty much
everything you love, right?

20:07.700 --> 20:09.300
Yeah, pretty much.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.200
<i>Kids, a lot
of weird, random things</i>

20:13.200 --> 20:14.900
<i>have happened in my life,</i>

20:14.900 --> 20:16.500
but that car accident
is one of the few

20:16.500 --> 20:20.100
<i>I'd call a miracle,
not because of what happened,</i>

20:20.100 --> 20:22.500
<i>but because
of what happened next.</i>

20:24.900 --> 20:26.000
Hi.

20:27.000 --> 20:27.900
Hi.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.600
Can I talk to you?

20:30.100 --> 20:31.600
Okay.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.800
I got you this
orange kangaroo.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.500
Uh... thanks.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.700
So I've been thinking
about what changed

20:44.700 --> 20:46.800
from the moment
I broke up with you

20:46.800 --> 20:49.000
to the moment I knew
I wanted you back.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.300
And, um, I think I finally
figured out what happened.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.200
Your cab got T-boned
by a jackass on a cell phone?

20:56.200 --> 20:59.000
No. I changed.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.100
I'm ready to give you
what you need.

21:02.400 --> 21:02.900
That's why I spent

21:02.900 --> 21:05.400
ten minutes on the
damn claw machine

21:05.400 --> 21:08.100
trying to get the big,
fake diamond ring.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.500
But all I could get
was this orange kangaroo.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.900
Diamond ring?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.500
Will you marry me?

21:17.500 --> 21:21.500
