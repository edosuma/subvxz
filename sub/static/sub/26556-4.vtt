- Hey.

22:33.312 --> 22:35.981
Got a call... From Rene.

22:35.983 --> 22:37.716
Oh. Of course he called you.

22:37.718 --> 22:39.755
Why? To talk some sense into me?

22:39.758 --> 22:42.388
I just came by to find
out why you locked him up.

22:42.390 --> 22:44.772
Because he broke the law again,

22:44.775 --> 22:46.341
and I can't keep making exceptions

22:46.344 --> 22:47.827
just because he's our friend, John.

22:47.829 --> 22:49.958
Sometimes, it's hard being
on the other side of this.

22:49.961 --> 22:53.188
Enforcing the rules. Yeah.

22:53.191 --> 22:55.591
That's been a tough
transition for me, too.

22:55.594 --> 22:58.204
Look. I know Rene believes
he's doing the right thing here,

22:58.206 --> 23:00.439
but our circumstances have changed.

23:00.441 --> 23:02.786
There is no way any of us can
help anyone if we're arrested

23:02.789 --> 23:05.744
by the FBI for violating
the immunity deal.

23:05.746 --> 23:08.581
More importantly, this police
force is a complete disaster

23:08.583 --> 23:10.316
after everything Diaz did to it.

23:10.318 --> 23:13.903
Dinah, you're under
pressure, a lot of pressure.

23:13.906 --> 23:16.422
I get that,

23:16.424 --> 23:18.791
but you sure it's not something more?

23:18.793 --> 23:23.229
Hey. You know what helps me?

23:23.231 --> 23:26.565
Spending time with J.J.

23:26.567 --> 23:30.817
Family, Dinah. That helps us through.

23:30.820 --> 23:34.140
John, living in the shadows is

23:34.142 --> 23:37.209
when all the worst things happen.

23:37.211 --> 23:39.245
Oliver going to prison,

23:39.247 --> 23:42.719
Vince... first undercover, and then...

23:45.419 --> 23:48.220
That's the real reason,

23:48.222 --> 23:52.324
because as much as I
believed in Team Arrow,

23:52.326 --> 23:54.560
I had to move on.

23:54.562 --> 23:56.622
I had to be a different kind of hero

23:56.625 --> 23:58.297
for this city.

23:58.299 --> 24:01.100
Yeah.

24:01.102 --> 24:03.903
You know, sometimes, I wonder
if there's any form of justice

24:03.905 --> 24:09.909
that's 100% on the
level, even at A.R.G.U.S.

24:09.911 --> 24:12.302
I think sometimes you need
vigilantes and law enforcement

24:12.305 --> 24:14.280
working together to get results.

24:16.050 --> 24:18.484
Quentin Lance...

24:18.486 --> 24:21.287
He did things by the book,

24:21.289 --> 24:23.648
but, Dinah, Lance was willing to work

24:23.651 --> 24:26.457
with anyone who could help him.

24:26.460 --> 24:29.728
This Green Arrow isn't Oliver.

24:29.730 --> 24:32.498
I can't risk everything for a stranger.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.266
But a stranger with good intel.

24:36.404 --> 24:39.405
Rene asked me to look into Jon Cortez,

24:39.407 --> 24:44.176
a merc arsonist with
his own crew for hire.

24:44.179 --> 24:46.613
What you do next with that
information is up to you.

24:56.457 --> 24:58.457
So this was Smoak tech?

25:00.503 --> 25:02.303
Must have been something in its heyday.

25:03.998 --> 25:06.198
This was Felicity's office.

25:07.117 --> 25:09.399
You know, it makes sense
that she would lead us here,

25:09.402 --> 25:13.638
but wouldn't it just be easier
for her to reach out to me?

25:13.641 --> 25:15.407
Why is she playing games?

25:17.612 --> 25:20.379
I have no idea.

25:20.381 --> 25:22.648
I mean, ironically, she was
the one who influenced me

25:22.650 --> 25:24.850
to go into the tech field,

25:24.852 --> 25:27.486
even after everything that happened.

25:27.488 --> 25:29.421
Well, you're a lot
more forgiving than me.

25:41.869 --> 25:45.337
Looks like a system Felicity
showed me when I was a kid.

25:45.339 --> 25:47.406
Back then, it was just a set of designs.

25:47.408 --> 25:49.541
Can you fix it?

25:49.543 --> 25:53.479
It's an extremely
outdated model, so yes.

25:53.481 --> 25:55.547
Just a simple recursive algorithm

25:55.549 --> 25:57.583

got the wrong address.

choice for that phone call,

26:50.243 --> 26:52.877

you out there trying

26:58.317 --> 27:00.651
to catch those arsonists on your own.

You don't like that, you
can stay locked up in here,

It just sounded like
you wanted to team up.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.672
Not permanently, no,

27:22.675 --> 27:24.408
but in this case, bending the rules

27:24.411 --> 27:26.867
might be the only way to
serve the greater good.

27:26.870 --> 27:29.469

Exactly. Look. Right
now, the SCPD on its own,

justice for The Glades,

make this happen for weeks.

I don't have jurisdiction
to get to... bank records.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.515
Jon Cortez has been receiving regular
payments from patbane holdings.

27:52.518 --> 27:55.238
So let me guess. Patbane
holdings isn't on the up and up.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.541
It's a shell company,
one that's been buying

27:57.543 --> 28:00.172
these torched-up properties
at highly reduced rates.

28:00.175 --> 28:04.310
So somebody's been burning down The
Glades and then buying it back up?

28:04.313 --> 28:06.580
So who's at the top of
the patbane food chain?

28:06.583 --> 28:09.518

28:24.971 --> 28:26.773
No. She's not being very chatty.

28:26.776 --> 28:28.342
Of course she's not. Make her chat.

28:28.345 --> 28:29.351
That's why you're here.

28:29.354 --> 28:31.574

28:31.577 --> 28:33.410
I'm gonna kill her.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.779
Since when did you care
about anybody's life?

28:35.781 --> 28:38.716
I don't, but if she's
dead, she can't talk,

28:38.718 --> 28:39.898
and then we have nothing.

28:39.901 --> 28:42.635
Which is what we have now.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.101
We need that information.

28:44.104 --> 28:46.945
And you're gonna get it
with a rusty screwdriver?

28:46.948 --> 28:49.826
If Diaz taught me
anything, it's patience.

28:49.829 --> 28:53.130

get revenge on one person.

In fact, I can actually stand
being around this new you.

29:07.933 --> 29:10.156
It's just once you do this,

29:10.159 --> 29:13.189
it's... it's really hard to
get back to who you were before,

29:13.192 --> 29:15.426
and I don't know if you ever can.

29:15.429 --> 29:18.863
Well, I've already accepted
that my old life is over,

29:18.866 --> 29:22.368

On my earth, I loved my father

29:29.456 --> 29:31.934
and my Ollie, but they
were taken away from me

29:31.937 --> 29:33.226
because they were murdered.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.273
It's when you lose the
people who matter most.

29:35.276 --> 29:37.476
Once you get through
the grief, you get angry,

29:37.479 --> 29:41.448
you want revenge, and I took it,

29:41.451 --> 29:45.082
but the darkness, it swallows
you the more you feed it,

back out to the light,

would have warned me

my hands the first time.

through the sewer to get here.

30:37.386 --> 30:40.211

30:40.214 --> 30:42.047
They built a wall.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.184
They closed their borders.

No one outside The Glades
is allowed to enter.

what's outside their wall.

have stayed on Lian Yu.
