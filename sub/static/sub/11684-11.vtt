WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:01.969
- MY NAME
IS MICHAEL WESTEN.

00:02.002 --> 00:04.705
I USED TO BE
A SPY UNTIL...

00:04.738 --> 00:05.806
- WE GOT A BURN NOTICE ON YOU.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.708
YOU'RE BLACKLISTED.
- [whistles]

00:07.741 --> 00:10.644
WHEN YOU'RE BURNED,
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.913
NO CASH, NO CREDIT,
NO JOB HISTORY.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.583
YOU'RE STUCK IN WHATEVER CITY
THEY DECIDE TO DUMP YOU IN.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.685
WHERE AM I?
- MIAMI.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.653
- YOU DO WHATEVER WORK
COMES YOUR WAY.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.356
YOU RELY ON ANYONE
WHO'S STILL TALKING TO YOU...

00:22.390 --> 00:24.725
[laughs]
A TRIGGER-HAPPY GIRLFRIEND...

00:24.758 --> 00:26.094
- SHOULD WE SHOOT THEM?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.096
- AN OLD FRIEND WHO USED
TO INFORM ON YOU TO THE FBI...

00:28.129 --> 00:30.831
- YOU KNOW SPIES--
BUNCH OF BITCHY LITTLE GIRLS.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.067
- FAMILY TOO...
- HEY, IS THAT YOUR MOM AGAIN?

00:33.101 --> 00:34.068
- IF YOU'RE DESPERATE.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.403
- SOMEONE NEEDS YOUR HELP,
MICHAEL.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.406
- AND A DOWN-AND-OUT SPY
YOU MET ALONG THE WAY.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.840
- THAT'S HOW WE DO IT,
PEOPLE.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.843
- BOTTOM LINE,
AS LONG AS YOU'RE BURNED,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.878
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.749
- WE'RE GOING AFTER THE LEADER
OF A TERRORIST NETWORK.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.418
- I AM THE MAN
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING TO MEET.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.785
- I'LL TELL YOU WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.721
- OLD LOYALTIES DIE HARD.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.357
AND I NEED TO KNOW THAT
YOU'VE LEFT YOURS BEHIND.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.792
- I HAVE NO REASON
TO RUN.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.629
AND I HAVE NOTHING
TO HIDE.

01:01.662 --> 01:02.930
- WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.632
- I GOT YOUR NUMBER
FROM A MUTUAL FRIEND.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.435
I'M HAVING A BARBECUE
IN HIS HONOR.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.770
- CARLOS IS IN TROUBLE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.372
- IT'S LOPEZ.
- LOPEZ FROM...

01:11.405 --> 01:12.573
- COLUMBIA.
- CHACHO,

01:12.606 --> 01:17.878
I WANT YOU TO SHOOT NANDO,
NOW!

01:17.911 --> 01:19.947
NOW, MAKE SURE YOUR GUESTS
GET HOME SAFELY.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.650
- TWO DAYS AGO,
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME

01:22.683 --> 01:23.751
NANDO GOT THE CALL,

01:23.784 --> 01:26.254
A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP
OPENED FIRE ON AN ESTATE

01:26.287 --> 01:29.590
OUTSIDE OF CARTEGENA.
SEVEN PEOPLE DIED, FI.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.393
I'M GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.827
YOU'RE TRAVELING A PATH
WITH MICHAEL.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.497
YOU ALWAYS HAVE.
- I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.904
- IT WAS NECESSARY.
JAMES HAS PLANS FOR YOU.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.839
BIG PLANS.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:45.873 --> 01:49.677
- YOU CAN ASK HIM YOURSELF.
HE WANTS TO SEE US.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.912
- ON AN UNDERCOVER
ASSIGNMENT,

01:51.945 --> 01:54.815
THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE
FOR BUILDING TRUST.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.083
IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF

01:56.116 --> 01:58.519
GETTING TO KNOW SOMEONE
SUPERFICIALLY.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.288
TO BE REALLY EFFECTIVE,
YOU NEED TO GET

02:00.321 --> 02:02.323
AS CLOSE TO THE TARGET
AS YOU CAN,

02:02.356 --> 02:05.193
BOTH PERSONALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.427
IT'S NEVER EASY.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.429
NO MATTER HOW MUCH TRAINING
YOU HAVE,

02:08.462 --> 02:10.964
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BECOME
SOMEONE'S CLOSEST FRIEND

02:10.998 --> 02:12.933
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE
ONLY DOING IT

02:12.966 --> 02:14.835
TO STEAL THEIR DEEPEST
SECRETS.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.705
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.808
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO,
MICHAEL.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.210
- LET ME HAVE THAT.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.878
- OH, THANK YOU.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.115
I HOPE YOU'RE RESTED.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.750
THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.855
- SO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT WE'RE DOING?

02:34.888 --> 02:37.391
- WE ARE MAKING
FAKE PASSPORTS AND VISAS

02:37.425 --> 02:39.193
AND THE USUAL
TRAVEL PAPERS.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.028
- ALL RIGHT.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.531
- YOU AND I ARE TRAVELING ABROAD
AS A COUPLE--

02:43.564 --> 02:45.833
ELLIOT AND TRICIA BRONSON.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.801
WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED
FOR A WHILE,

02:47.835 --> 02:49.903
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GET MEMORIZING.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.872
- THAT'S A LOT OF TROUBLE
FOR A SINGLE TRIP.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.907
- IT'S NOT JUST A TRIP,
MICHAEL.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.743
WE'RE JOINING JAMES
ON A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.845
- AND THAT MEETING IS?

02:57.878 --> 02:59.347
- THAT'S FOR JAMES
TO TELL YOU.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.915
WE SHOULD GET STARTED.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.918
- ONCE YOU'VE DEVELOPED
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TARGET,

03:04.952 --> 03:06.854
YOU CAN START TO USE
THAT RELATIONSHIP

03:06.887 --> 03:08.989
TO GET THE INFORMATION
YOU NEED.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.825
IF YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH,
YOU CAN MAKE AN INTERROGATION

03:11.859 --> 03:13.761
FEEL LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN
INNOCENT QUESTIONS

03:13.794 --> 03:15.763
FROM A TRUSTED FRIEND.

03:15.796 --> 03:20.334
IS IT IN EUROPE?

03:20.368 --> 03:22.903
IS IT IN ASIA?

03:22.936 --> 03:26.006
IS THE MEETING IN PAKISTAN?

03:26.039 --> 03:29.343
INDIA? CHINA?

03:29.377 --> 03:30.878
COME ON, SONYA.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.780
I'M BUILDING COVER I.D.s
IN THE DARK.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.548
IF THE MEETING'S
IN TEL AVIV,

03:34.582 --> 03:36.049
AND I SAY WE WERE JUST
IN CAIRO--

03:36.083 --> 03:40.020
- ALL RIGHT.
WE ARE GOING TO LATIN AMERICA.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.889
AND THAT IS ALL
THAT YOU GET.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.192
THERE, YOU'VE TAKEN BLOOD
FROM A STONE.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.829
ARE YOU HAPPY?
- HAPPIER.

03:51.399 --> 03:55.235
WHAT IS IT, THE WATERMARK?
- NO, THE WATERMARK IS GOOD.

03:55.269 --> 03:59.039
IT'S, UM...

03:59.072 --> 04:03.411
IT'S JUST IT'S FUNNY
THAT TRICIA BRONSON'S

04:03.444 --> 04:07.915
BEEN TO RIO THREE TIMES,
AND SONYA LEBEDENKO NEVER.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.885
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO.

04:11.919 --> 04:16.757
I ALMOST WENT ONE TIME,
AND THE JOB GOT IN THE WAY.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.493
THE JOB ALWAYS GETS
IN THE WAY.

04:23.431 --> 04:28.602
- WELL, I'VE BEEN TO RIO,
AND THERE ARE JOBS THERE TOO.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.305
MAYBE YOU AND I CAN
WORK TOGETHER THERE ONE DAY.

04:36.043 --> 04:40.781
- I WOULD LIKE THAT.

04:40.814 --> 04:44.284
- SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO
BE A TARGET'S FRIEND, HOWEVER.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.987
SOMETIMES TO ACCOMPLISH
A MISSION,

04:47.020 --> 04:49.056
YOU HAVE TO GO FURTHER.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.534
WHEN YOU SHARE A TARGET'S BED,

05:00.568 --> 05:03.103
WHEN THEY TRUST YOU ENOUGH
TO SLEEP BESIDE YOU,

05:03.136 --> 05:07.341
IT'S A SIMPLE THING TO GET
WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU NEED.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.648
THAT INFORMATION COMES
WITH A PRICE, THOUGH.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.650
OFTEN THE ONLY WAY
TO CONVINCE SOMEONE

05:16.684 --> 05:18.886
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THEM
IS TO ACTUALLY

05:18.919 --> 05:21.121
START CARING ABOUT THEM.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.491
AND NO MATTER
HOW IMPORTANT THE MISSION IS,

05:23.524 --> 05:26.126
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR CAUSE,

05:26.159 --> 05:28.028
IT FEELS LIKE WHAT IT IS--

05:28.061 --> 05:33.033
A COMPLETE BETRAYAL
OF SOMEONE'S TRUST.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.536
- A CAR WILL PICK YOU UP
AT 8:00.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.439
- I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW MORNING.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.651
[phone beeps]

05:50.684 --> 05:52.686
- MICHAEL, HOW'D IT GO?

05:52.720 --> 05:56.323
- IT'S DONE.
- NICE WORK, LADY-KILLER.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.025
NOW, YOU JUST GET ME
THAT DRIVE,

05:58.058 --> 05:59.560
AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHERE JAMES IS HEADED.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.395
- I'LL MAKE THE DROP
AT THE USUAL PLACE.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.764
- EXCELLENT.
WE ARE SO CLOSE

06:03.797 --> 06:05.766
TO BRINGING
THIS SON OF A BITCH DOWN.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.200
YOU READY TO END THIS?

06:07.234 --> 06:10.871
- BELIEVE ME, I'M READY.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.618
- I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE NSA ENCRYPTION TEAM.

06:24.652 --> 06:25.786
THE DATA YOU RIPPED
FROM SONYA'S PHONE

06:25.819 --> 06:27.220
WAS A GOLD MINE.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.756
- SO WE KNOW WHERE JAMES IS.
- NO.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.524
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME,
WE KNOW WHERE HE'S GONNA BE

06:30.558 --> 06:32.092
BEFORE HE GETS THERE.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.128
THE MEETING IS GOING DOWN
TOMORROW IN VERACRUZ, MEXICO.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.198
SONYA BOOKED TWO JEEPS
AND AN ARMORED TRANSPORT.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.567
NOW, WE BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA BE WITH JAMES

06:39.600 --> 06:41.735
FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS,
WHICH IS A TIGHT WINDOW,

06:41.769 --> 06:42.903
BUT IT'S BIG ENOUGH.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.072
SONYA SCOUTED A ROUTE
FROM THE AIRPORT

06:45.105 --> 06:48.275
TO A LOCATION IN THE SOUTHWEST
CORNER OF TOWN.

06:48.308 --> 06:51.111
BUT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
MAKE IT.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.114
'CAUSE WHEN YOU GET
TO THIS CORRIDOR HERE,

06:54.147 --> 06:55.716
WE DROP THE HAMMER.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.785
- SO YOU'RE GONNA HIT A CONVOY
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

06:57.818 --> 07:00.554
ON FOREIGN SOIL?
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHY?

07:00.588 --> 07:01.555
- FOR STARTERS,
HOW DO OUR FRIENDS

07:01.589 --> 07:02.923
SOUTH OF THE BORDER
FEEL ABOUT THAT?

07:02.956 --> 07:03.991
- WELL, THEY WOULD DEFINITELY
FROWN ON IT,

07:04.024 --> 07:04.992
IF THEY KNEW ABOUT IT.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.494
- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.061
I'M WORRIED ABOUT JAMES.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.229
I'LL BE SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.998
WHAT HAPPENS
IF IT GOES WRONG?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.066
- NO, HE'S NEVER GONNA KNOW
IT WAS US UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.235
THE EXTRACTION TEAM
I HIRED TO DO THE GRAB

07:15.268 --> 07:17.104
COULD NOT BE FARTHER
FROM CIA PERSONNEL.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.839
- WE'RE GOING FREELANCE NOW?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.307
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

07:20.340 --> 07:22.242
- LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.
THEY CAN HANDLE IT.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.343
- STRONG, WE'RE RUSHING THIS.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.245
THERE ARE JUST
TOO MANY VARIABLES.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.681
THE LOCATION, THE TIMETABLE--

07:27.715 --> 07:30.150
- I HAVE BEEN AFTER JAMES
FOR ALMOST A DECADE.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.752
I'M NOT GONNA LET
THE CHANCE TO GRAB HIM

07:31.785 --> 07:33.821
SLIP THROUGH MY HANDS
BECAUSE YOU THINK WE'RE RUSHING.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.690
MICHAEL, WE MADE A DEAL.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.959
NOW THE BILL HAS COME DUE.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.327
IF YOU WANT
YOUR OLD LIFE BACK,

07:40.360 --> 07:43.597
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.465
- DON'T WORRY, BROTHER.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.569
WE'LL BE THERE
TO WATCH YOUR BACK.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.340
- AS A SPY,
YOU GET USED TO THE IDEA

07:53.373 --> 07:55.208
THAT EVERY SUCCESSFUL
OPERATION

07:55.242 --> 07:57.845
COMES AT A PRICE.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.847
SOMETIMES IT'S LIVES LOST,

07:59.880 --> 08:01.715
OTHER TIMES
IT'S CITIES DESTROYED

08:01.749 --> 08:04.217
OR LIVELIHOODS RUINED.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.521
THEN THERE ARE OTHER COSTS
THAT ARE MORE PERSONAL.

08:07.555 --> 08:11.191
LESS OBVIOUS, BUT THE PAIN IS
JUST AS REAL.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.227
[knock at door]

08:21.535 --> 08:24.572
- HEY.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.039
COME ON IN.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.877
I'M JUST PACKING UP THE LAST
OF CARLOS' STUFF.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.646
[sighs]

08:32.680 --> 08:36.149
- I'M SORRY ABOUT
ALL THIS, FI.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.185
- MICHAEL,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:38.218 --> 08:41.388
- I'M LEAVING TOWN
FOR A JOB...

08:41.421 --> 08:43.256
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

08:43.290 --> 08:47.561
- [scoffs]

08:47.595 --> 08:51.264
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH YOUR WORK WITH JAMES

08:51.298 --> 08:54.835
AND HIS NETWORK
HAS COST ME?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.770
- DO YOU EVEN CARE?
- I'M GONNA TAKE 'EM DOWN, FI.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.171
ALL OF THEM.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.742
JAMES, SONYA, FOR GOOD.
THAT'S WHAT THIS MISSION IS.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.111
BUT JAMES HAS HIS MEN
WATCHING MY MOM

09:04.144 --> 09:06.046
AROUND THE CLOCK.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.381
AND WHEN I BETRAY HIM...

09:08.415 --> 09:11.451
- YEAH.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.286
- SO I'M ASKING YOU
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

09:13.320 --> 09:18.892
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST
TO PROTECT HER AND CHARLIE.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.561
PLEASE.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.301
- FINISH THIS.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.986
- WELCOME TO VERACRUZ.
- THANK YOU, MY DEAR.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.289
THE VEHICLES ARE SET?
EXCELLENT.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.059
MICHAEL, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.828
BIG DAY FOR US.
- HAPPY TO BE PART OF IT.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.464
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU'VE TRAINED,

09:57.497 --> 09:59.232
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU'VE PLANNED,

09:59.266 --> 10:01.669
THERE'S ALWAYS ANXIETY
IN THE MOMENTS BEFORE

10:01.702 --> 10:04.104
YOU CAPTURE A TARGET.

10:04.137 --> 10:08.208
MOST THINGS ARE SIMPLY
OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.

10:10.043 --> 10:14.081
YOUR OPERATIONS TEAM MAY BE
MONITORING THE SITUATION,

10:14.114 --> 10:15.515
BUT THEY'RE USUALLY
TOO FAR AWAY

10:15.548 --> 10:18.618
TO DO MUCH BUT WATCH.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.621
YOUR EXTRACTION TEAM IS THERE
TO DO ONE JOB,

10:21.655 --> 10:23.924
AND ONE JOB ONLY--

10:23.957 --> 10:27.928
ACQUIRE THE TARGETS, WHICH
EFFECTIVELY LEAVES YOU ALONE.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.698
AT THE END OF THE DAY
ALL YOU CAN DO IS SMILE,

10:30.731 --> 10:32.800
PLAY ALONG,
AND TRY NOT TO GET KILLED

10:32.833 --> 10:34.167
WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTS.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.104
SO WHAT IS IN VERACRUZ,
OTHER THAN FRESH SEAFOOD?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.305
OR IS THAT CLASSIFIED?

10:38.338 --> 10:41.274
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY
HAS BEEN YEARS I THE MAKING.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.510
LET'S JUST SAY
OUR LITTLE ORGANIZATION

10:43.543 --> 10:48.115
IS ABOUT TO MAKE
A GIANT LEAP FORWARD.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.549
- ONE MORE TIME, ALPHA TEAM.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.618
MICHAEL'S TO BE TREATED
AS AN ENEMY COMBATANT

10:51.651 --> 10:52.953
UNTIL HE IS IN OUR CUSTODY

10:52.986 --> 10:54.822
AND ON HIS WAY BACK
TO THE STATES.

10:54.855 --> 10:58.225
DO YOU COPY?
- COPY THAT.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.862
- OKAY, GO TIME, PEOPLE.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.097
- THE TARGETS ARE APPROACHING
THE CORRIDOR.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.341
- WHAT IS IT?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.510
- IT'S JUST A FEELING.
TIGHT SPACE.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.679
ALMOST NOBODY
ON THE STREET.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.082
THIS IS THE FIRST BLOCK
THAT WE'VE PASSED

11:22.115 --> 11:23.083
WITHOUT VENDORS.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.519
- YOU DON'T THINK--

11:26.553 --> 11:28.255
- RADIO THE OTHERS.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.422
TELL 'EM TO KEEP
THEIR EYES PEELED.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.258
- YES, SIR.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.492
- TARGET IN SIGHT.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.063
- CONTACT IN TEN, NINE,

11:36.096 --> 11:38.398
EIGHT, SEVEN,

11:38.431 --> 11:43.670
SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.105
TWO--

11:45.138 --> 11:48.909
[explosion, tires screech]

11:48.942 --> 11:49.910
- WHAT THE HELL?

11:49.943 --> 11:51.278
[gunfire]

11:51.311 --> 11:53.480
- GET DOWN!
GET DOWN!

12:03.290 --> 12:04.858
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, STRONG?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.760
I MEAN, IS YOUR EXTRACTION TEAM
TRYING TO DISABLE THE CONVOY,

12:06.794 --> 12:08.261
OR JUST SHOOT IT
TO KINGDOM COME?

12:08.295 --> 12:10.530
- THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE
WE GET JAMES KENDRICK.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.767
- WE GOT FOUR SHOOTERS
ON THE ROOFTOPS,

12:13.801 --> 12:15.435
TWO ON THE SOUTH SIDE.
WE'LL TAKE THEM OUT FIRST.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.736
- READY.
- JAMES, WAIT, WAIT.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.305
THEY'RE ONLY SHOOTING
AT OUR ENGINE BLOCK 'CAUSE

12:18.338 --> 12:21.041
I THINK THEY WANT US ALIVE.
- WE WILL NOT BE CAPTURED.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.276
- THEY GOT THE DROP ON US.
IF WE STEP OUT OF HERE--

12:23.310 --> 12:26.613
- IF IT IS A CAPTURE MISSION,
THEY WON'T SHOOT TO KILL.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.949
- LET'S GO.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.585
- [grunts]

12:37.457 --> 12:38.992
- AH!

12:45.298 --> 12:47.134
- GRAB VEHICLES, MOVE IN.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.270
[tires screeching]

12:50.303 --> 12:51.972
- INCOMING!

12:52.005 --> 12:55.075
- JAMES, WE GOT ANOTHER SUV.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.576
THEY'RE CUTTING US OFF!

12:56.609 --> 12:58.578
- THERE'S A GRENADE LAUNCHER
IN THE REAR VEHICLE!

12:58.611 --> 13:00.147
- THE ENGINE'S ON FIRE.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.181
IT'LL BLOW
BEFORE YOU GET THERE.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.582
- CHECK THE LEAD JEEP
FOR WOUNDED.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.783
WE'RE NOT LEAVING
ANYBODY BEHIND.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.385
COVER ME!

13:14.727 --> 13:16.363
- AAH!

13:16.396 --> 13:17.464
- GO! YOU'RE CLEAR!

13:17.497 --> 13:20.700
- MOVE IT! MOVE IT!

13:20.733 --> 13:24.371
- GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

13:27.841 --> 13:31.444
[tires screeching]

13:31.478 --> 13:33.713
- THEY'RE CLOSING IN!

13:40.720 --> 13:43.891
- MOVE OUT!

13:49.997 --> 13:51.564
- COME ON, HUSTLE UP.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.799
- WHEN YOU'RE UNDERCOVER

13:52.832 --> 13:55.202
AND RUNNING FROM YOUR OWN
CAPTURE TEAM,

13:55.235 --> 13:56.669
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.205
- MOVE! MOVE!

13:58.238 --> 14:00.573
- BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
YOU HAVE TO CREATE A TRAIL

14:00.607 --> 14:04.577
FOR YOUR FRIENDS TO FIND.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.514
- GET SOME VEHICLES.
GO! GO!

14:07.547 --> 14:08.815
[tires screech]

14:08.848 --> 14:13.653
[both speaking Spanish]

14:13.686 --> 14:15.889
- CELL PHONES CAN BE TRACKED,
WHICH MEANS

14:15.923 --> 14:17.690
IF YOU CAN KEEP ONE
CLOSE BY,

14:17.724 --> 14:21.094
IT GIVES YOUR TEAM A SHOT
AT FINDING YOU.

14:21.128 --> 14:24.697
- GO.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.604
- JESUS! NOTHING?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.606
WELL, SPREAD OUT
AND KEEP LOOKING!

14:33.640 --> 14:35.508
ALPHA TEAM TOOK A BEATING.
SEVEN DOWN.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.509
- HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE WE TOLD YOU?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.211
THESE PEOPLE ARE BETTER
THAN YOU THINK.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.879
- HEY, POLICE JUST GOT A CALL

14:39.913 --> 14:41.548
ABOUT A STOLEN CAR
IN COSTA VERDE.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.516
A BLUE NISSAN SEDAN.
- WELL, THAT NARROWS IT DOWN

14:43.550 --> 14:44.517
TO ABOUT HALF THE CARS
IN MEXICO.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.019
- THE VICTIM SAID
A CARJACKER

14:46.053 --> 14:47.287
FITTING MIKE'S DESCRIPTION
GRABBED HER PHONE

14:47.320 --> 14:48.288
AND THREW IT IN THE CAR.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.356
- ATTABOY, MIKE.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.124
- HEY, FIND OUT
WHO THAT WOMAN IS.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.459
TRACK DOWN THAT CELL SIGNAL.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.961
AND I MEAN TEN MINUTES AGO.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.128
COME ON, GUYS.

14:55.162 --> 14:58.131
WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE
IN THE CHOPPER.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.366
[cell phone rings]

14:59.399 --> 15:00.934
- YEAH, FI, WE'RE
A LITTLE BUSY HERE.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.936
- SAM, WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON?

15:02.970 --> 15:05.105
I'M OUTSIDE MADELINE'S.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.107
JAMES' GUYS HAVE BEEN
SITTING IN THAT CAR ALL DAY.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.441
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
THEY'RE BUZZING AROUND.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.943
LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST GOT
SOME BAD NEWS.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.544
- WELL, WE TRIED
TO GRAB JAMES,

15:11.578 --> 15:12.946
BUT HE SLIPPED THROUGH
OUR NET.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.114
HE MUST HAVE CALLED THEM.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.582
- THEY'RE GOING TOWARD
THE HOUSE.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.317
YOU THINK THEY KNOW
MICHAEL BETRAYED THEM?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.751
- YEAH, LOOK,
THAT'S JUST THE THING, THOUGH.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.553
WE DON'T KNOW IF MIKE'S COVER'S
BEEN BLOWN OR NOT.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.322
- WELL, WE GOTTA MAKE A CALL.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.124
'CAUSE IF IT HAS,
MADELINE'S DEAD.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.493
- AND IF IT HASN'T, YOU SHOOTING
A COUPLE OF JAMES' GUYS

15:26.526 --> 15:30.597
IS JUST GONNA TIP 'EM OFF,
AND THEN MIKE IS DEAD.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.800
- YOU GOT A WHOLE BUILDING
GOING ON HERE, HUH?

15:33.833 --> 15:36.236
[knock at door]

15:36.269 --> 15:37.971
SWEETHEART,
YOU BE A GOOD BOY.

15:38.005 --> 15:38.972
YOU PLAY WITH YOUR BLOCKS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.808
OKAY.

15:41.841 --> 15:42.976
- LOOK, FI, DON'T SHOOT.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.677
DON'T SHOOT.
WE GOTTA BET ON MIKE

15:44.711 --> 15:46.013
THAT SOMEHOW
HE KEPT HIS COVER.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.281
- ALL RIGHT, I'M HOLDING OFF
FOR NOW.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.250
BUT IF THEY SO MUCH AS
LOOK AT HER SIDEWAYS,

15:50.283 --> 15:51.584
I'M PULLING THE TRIGGER.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.619
- MA'AM.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.021
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
MRS. WESTEN,

15:54.054 --> 15:58.291
BUT WE NEED
TO COME INSIDE.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.692
- UH, NO.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.595
LOOK, I SPOKE TO YOUR BOSS.
I WAS VERY CLEAR

16:02.629 --> 16:05.598
ABOUT YOU PEOPLE BEING
IN MY HOME.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.966
- THEY'RE FORCING
THEIR WAY IN.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.037
- MRS. WESTEN,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.872
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MICHAEL?
- WE CAN'T DISCUSS IT.

16:12.905 --> 16:17.010
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST US.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.712
- ALL RIGHT, COME IN.

16:22.382 --> 16:26.019
- FI, DID YOU DO IT?
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.387
- SHE WAVED ME OFF.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.622
NEXT TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS
DOWN THERE--

16:29.656 --> 16:33.360
- BELIEVE ME.
YOU'LL BE OUR FIRST CALL.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.827
- WITH LITTLE GOVERNMENT
OVERSIGHT

16:34.861 --> 16:36.729
AND A BOOMING
PRIVATE SECTOR,

16:36.763 --> 16:39.866
MEXICO HAS ONE OF THE MOST
UNREGULATED AIRSPACES

16:39.899 --> 16:41.568
IN LATIN AMERICA.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.371
BAD NEWS FOR SAFETY
AND AIR POLLUTION,

16:44.404 --> 16:47.006
BUT GOOD NEWS IF YOU NEED
TO CONDUCT A MANHUNT

16:47.040 --> 16:49.476
WITHOUT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
FINDING OUT.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.678
- OKAY, GENTLEMEN,
HQ GOT US A SIGNAL.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.046
THE CELL PHONE
THAT MICHAEL GRABBED

16:53.080 --> 16:54.714
IS IN THIS SECTOR DOWN HERE.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.750
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A 2009
NISSAN ALTIMA.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.352
- WHICH WAY'S THE SIGNAL
MOVING?

16:59.386 --> 17:02.489
- UH, NORTH BY NORTHEAST.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.656
- THERE WE GO.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.693
BLUE SEDAN RIGHT THERE,
HANGING A LEFT.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.928
- NOPE, OURS IS STILL
GOING STRAIGHT.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.930
AND THAT'S AN AUDI,
NOT A NISSAN.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.665
- YOU CAN TELL
FROM A COUPLE THOUSAND FEET UP?

17:12.699 --> 17:16.069
- I'M A CAR GUY.
OKAY, HE JUST TURNED RIGHT.

17:16.103 --> 17:19.339
- WAIT A SECOND, ANOTHER BLUE
SEDAN FOLLOWING THAT TRUCK.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.174
THEY'RE TRAVELING TOGETHER.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.275
- THAT'S GOTTA BE JAMES AND HIS
WHOLE DAMN CREW RIGHT THERE.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.344
- ALPHA TEAM,
WE HAVE A VISUAL

17:24.377 --> 17:26.579
ON THE TARGETS--
THEY'RE IN A CARAVAN

17:26.613 --> 17:29.949
DRIVING NORTH
ON HIGHWAY 150D,

17:29.982 --> 17:32.252
JUST PAST THE BUSTAMANTE EXIT.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.053
- THERE'S A REASON
HELICOPTERS ARE

17:34.087 --> 17:35.555
THE SEARCH VEHICLES OF CHOICE

17:35.588 --> 17:38.291
FOR EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY
IN THE WORLD.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.793
WHEN YOU CAN TRAVEL
150 MILES PER HOUR

17:40.827 --> 17:44.297
ON ANY AXIS,
WITH 60 MILES OF VISIBILITY,

17:44.331 --> 17:47.234
THERE'S VIRTUALLY NOWHERE
FOR YOUR TARGET TO HIDE.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.569
- KEEP THOSE VEHICLES IN SIGHT.
- YES, SIR.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.705
- THE DOWNSIDE OF USING
A HELICOPTER IS THAT

17:52.739 --> 17:55.375
WHEN YOU'RE SURROUNDED
BY NOTHING BUT SKY,

17:55.408 --> 17:58.245
THERE'S NOWHERE FOR YOU
TO HIDE EITHER.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.480
- PULL OVER DOWN HERE.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.486
- WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.054
- THERE'S A CHOPPER
FOLLOWING US.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.223
BEST CHANCE TO LOSE IT,
SPLIT UP.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.825
- WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER.
IF WE SPLIT UP--

18:12.859 --> 18:14.060
- IT'S A RISK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.662
NOW, THERE WAS A BOATYARD
THREE MILES AGO.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.597
DOUBLE BACK,
GET YOURSELVES A BOAT,

18:17.630 --> 18:18.765
HEAD UP THE COAST.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.099
WE'LL FIND THE NEXT MARINA,
GET ONE OF OUR OWN.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.101
- HOW WILL WE FIND YOU?
- I'LL CONTACT YOU,

18:22.135 --> 18:24.437
GIVE YOU DIRECTIONS
SO THE SAFE HOUSE.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.674
LET'S MOVE OUT.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.079
- YOU HEARD THE MAN.
LET'S GO.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.681
- ALL RIGHT,
THE TRUCK'S LEAVING.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.516
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

18:36.549 --> 18:39.519
- DAMN IT, THEY'RE SPLITTING UP!

18:39.552 --> 18:41.621
ALPHA TEAM, TARGET VEHICLES
ARE NOW HEADING

18:41.654 --> 18:43.190
IN SEPARATE DIRECTIONS.
YOU FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

18:43.223 --> 18:44.891
FROM THE CELL PHONE,
WE'LL STAY ON THE TRUCK.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.700
- ANY LUCK?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.802
- NOTHING WE CAN GET
IN THE WATER.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.136
- THERE'S A TRAWLER
IN THERE.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.538
THE WIRING'S SHOT,
BUT MARK'S SEEING

18:58.571 --> 19:00.740
IF HE CAN GET IT STARTED.
COME ON.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.680
[boat engine turns over, dies]
HOW'S IT GOING?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.782
- GETTING THERE.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.885
- OWEN, HELP ME FIND
SOME FUEL.

19:12.919 --> 19:16.489
[boat engine turns, dies]

19:17.890 --> 19:20.059
[engine turns, dies]

19:20.092 --> 19:21.794
[creaking]

19:21.828 --> 19:23.696
- YOU HEAR THAT?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.498
[snaps fingers]

19:25.532 --> 19:27.967
ALEX, COVER THE DOOR.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.204
[gunfire]

19:47.587 --> 19:49.922
- ADVANCE ON THREE.
ONE, TWO--

19:49.956 --> 19:52.759
AH!

19:52.792 --> 19:54.294
- OOH!

19:56.796 --> 19:58.798
- [grunts]

20:01.268 --> 20:05.872
- ALPHA TEAM, I'M A FRIENDLY.
DON'T SHOOT.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.642
- COME ON OUT, MICHAEL.
WE'RE ALL CLEAR.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.012
[gunshots]

20:13.045 --> 20:16.249
- HE WAS DOWN.
THIS IS A CAPTURE MISSION!

20:16.283 --> 20:19.919
- HEY.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.955
- SIMON.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.024
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.059
- RELAX, MICHAEL.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.262
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.230
YOU WERE WAITING
FOR ALPHA TEAM.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.433
I'M ALPHA TEAM.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.911
- NO, NO.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.546
I CAPTURED YOU.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.148
I PUT YOU AWAY, SIMON.
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.452
- BUT IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE
IN THE WORLD.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.555
USE THAT BIG BRAIN OF YOURS.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.956
THE FACT THAT
YOU CAPTURED ME

20:56.989 --> 21:00.393
MAKES ME THE PERFECT MAN
FOR THE JOB.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.963
YOU'RE DEEP COVER.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.065
WHOEVER RAN THE EXTRACTION TEAM
HAD TO BE SOMEBODY

21:06.098 --> 21:07.567
WHO DIDN'T WORK
FOR THE CIA.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.569
SOMEBODY WHO YOU'D
NEVER WORK WITH.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.571
SOMEBODY LIKE ME.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.672
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'D NEVER WORK WITH YOU.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.940
I'M GONNA CALL THIS IN.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.108
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA SAY?

21:16.142 --> 21:18.478
THIS AIN'T MY FIRST RODEO.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.146
THEY GOT ME OUT
OF THE BOX

21:20.179 --> 21:23.115
ALMOST AS SOON
AS YOU PUT ME IN IT.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.585
YEAH. BOY, I'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR THEM

21:25.618 --> 21:28.020
GOING ON, LIKE,
TWO YEARS NOW.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.089
OFF THE BOOKS, NATURALLY.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.958
THEY DROP ME INTO HOT SPOTS
WHEN THEY NEED SOMEONE

21:31.991 --> 21:33.159
TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.362
- THERE'S NO WAY THEY'D
LET YOU OUT OF PRISON

21:35.395 --> 21:36.963
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.432
- WAKE UP, MICHAEL.

21:39.466 --> 21:43.269
GUYS LIKE US,
WE'RE WEAPONS.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.171
AS LONG AS WE'RE USEFUL,
SOMEBODY'S ALWAYS GONNA WANT

21:45.204 --> 21:46.439
TO TAKE US OUT TO PLAY.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.976
NOW, I'M WILLING TO LET
BYGONES BE BYGONES,

21:50.009 --> 21:52.044
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.513
[radio static]

21:53.546 --> 21:56.383
- ALPHA TEAM
DO YOU COPY?

21:56.416 --> 21:58.117
- THAT'S THE BOSS MAN NOW.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.253
OKAY WITH YOU
IF I ANSWER?

22:04.023 --> 22:07.059
I'M HERE, MR. STRONG.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.061
I JUST KILLED A COUPLE
OF JAMES' MEN.

22:09.095 --> 22:12.064
UNFORTUNATELY, I LOST MY TEAM
IN THE PROCESS.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.299
- WHAT ABOUT JAMES
AND SONYA?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.802
- I'M GUESSING THEY'RE
IN THAT TRUCK

22:15.835 --> 22:17.504
YOU'RE FOLLOWING NOW.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.171
- WE'RE NEAR THE CALAVERA
MARINA.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.508
I NEED YOU TO GET YOUR ASS
OVER HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.043
- LOVE TO, RIGHT AFTER
MICHAEL HERE DECIDES

22:24.076 --> 22:25.412
WHETHER OR NOT
HE'S GONNA SHOOT ME.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.147
JUST GIVE US ONE SECOND.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.916
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, SLUGGER?

22:29.949 --> 22:33.019
YOU GONNA COMPLETE
THIS MISSION OR NOT?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.326
I THINK HE'S COMING AROUND.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.360
NOW, HOW DO WE GET
TO THIS MARINA?

22:41.394 --> 22:43.596
- TEN MILES SOUTH
DOWN CALLE OCHO.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.997
RADIO WHEN YOU'RE NEAR.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.635
- COPY.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.978
- LOOKS LIKE JAMES WANTS TO PLAY
A LITTLE HIDE AND SEEK.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.415
- ALL RIGHT, CIRCLE AND DESCEND.
- YES, SIR.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.051
- SINCE THE VIETNAM WAR,
HELICOPTERS HAVE GIVEN

23:05.084 --> 23:08.120
TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR FORCES
A HUGE ADVANTAGE

23:08.154 --> 23:09.956
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.190
IN ALMOST EVERY SITUATION,

23:11.223 --> 23:14.026
YOUR TARGET'S ONLY MOVE
IS TO RUN AND HIDE.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.262
BUT AS EVERYONE FROM
THE VIET CONG

23:16.295 --> 23:18.064
TO THE MUJAHIDEEN HAS LEARNED,

23:18.097 --> 23:21.100
A HELICOPTER'S MAIN DEFENSE
IS ITS MANEUVERABILITY.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.270
AND IF THEY CAN FORCE YOU INTO
HOVERING OVER A TIGHT SPACE,

23:24.303 --> 23:26.305
LIKE A VALLEY
BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS

23:26.338 --> 23:29.075
OR AN ALLEY
BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS...

23:29.108 --> 23:30.142
- THERE THEY ARE.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.244
- THEY CAN MAKE YOU
AN EASY TARGET.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.880
[gunfire]

23:33.913 --> 23:34.881
[bullets ricochet]

23:34.914 --> 23:37.149
- HEADS UP.
HEADS UP!

23:39.752 --> 23:42.154
- GET US OUTTA HERE!
- WE'RE HIT. WE'RE LOSING FUEL.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.089
I GOTTA SET HER DOWN.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.591
[alarm blaring]

23:44.624 --> 23:46.593
- SON OF A BITCH.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.795
- ALPHA TEAM,
WE GOT A PROBLEM.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.263
JAMES AND SONYA JUST LIT US UP.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LAND.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.099
- SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.001
UH...BUCKLE UP?

23:55.034 --> 23:57.637
SO MUCH FOR OUR AIR SUPPORT.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.405
SOUNDS LIKE JAMES AND SONYA
WILL BE LONG GONE

23:59.438 --> 24:01.407
BEFORE WE GET TO THAT MARINA.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.175
ANY IDEA WHERE
THEY'RE HEADED?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.512
- SAFE HOUSE
OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.613
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.949
- WELL, I READ JAMES' FILE.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.952
ONE THING I DO KNOW, HE HAS
A SOFT SPOT FOR HIS FRIENDS.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.354
IF THE SITUATION IS DIRE ENOUGH,

24:15.387 --> 24:16.789
NO WAY HE LEAVES YOU HANGING.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.025
OH, OH, I GOT IT.
GET JAMES ON THE RADIO.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.493
TELL HIM ALL HELL
HAS BROKEN LOOSE.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.161
TELL HIM HE NEEDS
TO GET HERE NOW.

24:22.194 --> 24:25.297
HEY, BUDDY.

24:25.331 --> 24:28.835
WHAT, YOU GOT STAGE FRIGHT?

24:28.868 --> 24:33.640
GO ON.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.642
- JAMES. JAMES, IT'S MICHAEL.
ARE YOU THERE?

24:35.675 --> 24:37.677
- I SAID I WOULD CONTACT YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:37.710 --> 24:38.945
- WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY HERE.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.113
THEY GOT THE DROP ON US.
- CAN YOU HANDLE IT?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.816
- I'M TRYING TO SAVE OUR GUYS.
- [pained groan]

24:43.850 --> 24:46.018
[screams]

24:46.052 --> 24:48.187
[grunts]

24:48.220 --> 24:50.489
- MICHAEL, ARE YOU STILL THERE?
MICHAEL.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.124
- YEAH, I--
I'M GOING IN,

24:52.158 --> 24:55.061
BUT I'M GONNA NEED BACKUP.
- WHERE ARE YOU?

24:55.094 --> 24:56.696
- BOATYARD.
EAST BOATHOUSE.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.231
- YOU STAY STRONG.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.867
- STAY STRONG?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.869
DID HE GET THAT
OFF A BUMPER STICKER?

25:02.902 --> 25:04.837
- MOVE AWAY FROM HIM.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.473
- OH, COME ON.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.676
JAMES IS SMART.
I HAD TO MAKE IT CONVINCING.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.977
- THAT WASN'T NECESSARY.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.313
- YOU THINK I HAVEN'T
DONE WORSE FOR THE CIA?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.248
HELL, THEY'LL PROBABLY PIN
A MEDAL ON MY CHEST AFTER THIS.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.084
- DON'T TOUCH THIS MAN AGAIN.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.887
- OH, CRY ME A RIVER.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.522
YOU WANNA WEEP FOR SOMEBODY,
HOW 'BOUT MY MEN?

25:23.556 --> 25:27.727
LIKE PACO, OR WHAT'S-HIS-FACE
THERE WITH THE MOUSTACHE?

25:27.760 --> 25:29.361
RIGHT THERE.

25:29.395 --> 25:32.298
YOU STILL IN ONE PIECE,
BRAVO TEAM?

25:35.034 --> 25:37.003
- WE'RE ON THE GROUND,
BUT WE LOST JAMES AND SONYA.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.671
- WELL, I HAVE SOME
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.773
THANKS TO MICHAEL'S
STIRRING PERFORMANCE,

25:40.807 --> 25:43.576
THEY'RE RACING OVER HERE.
WE'RE SETTING A LITTLE TRAP.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.844
IF YOU WANT TO CATCH
THE SHOW,

25:44.877 --> 25:46.846
HURRY ON OVER
TO THE EAST BOATHOUSE.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.381
- NICE WORK.
WE'LL SEE YOU THERE.

25:49.415 --> 25:52.118
MICHAEL HELPED ALPHA TEAM
LURE JAMES AND SONYA

25:52.151 --> 25:53.352
BACK TO THE BOATHOUSE.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.854
- GOOD. LET'S DO THIS.
- WAIT, HANG ON.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.122
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,
THERE'S SOMETHING

25:56.155 --> 25:57.389
I NEED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT THE LEADER OF ALPHA TEAM.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.557
- WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO DROP

25:58.591 --> 25:59.558
SOME REALLY BAD NEWS?

25:59.592 --> 26:01.227
- YEAH, WHO IS IT?
SPIT IT OUT.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.096
- SIMON ESCHER.
- WHAT?

26:04.130 --> 26:07.233
- AS IN SIMON,
THE HOMICIDAL MANIAC?

26:07.266 --> 26:08.701
AND YOU'RE LETTING HIM
RUN A TEAM?

26:08.735 --> 26:10.269
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

26:10.302 --> 26:12.371
- HE'S BEEN WORKING
WITH THE AGENCY FOR A WHILE NOW,

26:12.404 --> 26:14.073
AND HE IS A TOP-NOTCH OPERATOR.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.275
NOBODY HAS A BETTER RECORD
IN HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTS.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.443
- I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT HIS RECORD!

26:17.476 --> 26:19.211
THEY GUY TRIED TO BLOW UP
HALF OF MIAMI!

26:19.245 --> 26:20.813
- WE'VE KEPT HIM
ON A TIGHT LEASH,

26:20.847 --> 26:23.315
AND I HAVE BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR
ABOUT THE MISSION'S PARAMETERS.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.084
- LOOK, TO HELL
WITH YOUR PARAMETERS.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.252
YOU'RE WORKING WITH A MONSTER!

26:26.285 --> 26:28.154
- AND WHAT IS MICHAEL?
HUH?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.757
HE SHOT A SENIOR CIA OFFICER
IN THE FACE.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.158
- DON'T YOU DARE
COMPARE THE TWO.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.727
- I WILL WORK WITH WHO I HAVE
TO GET THE JOB DONE.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.062
NOW, YOU BACK OFF.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.564
- GUYS, WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM
HERE, OKAY?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.299
AND IT'S NOT JUST
OUR ASSES ON THE LINE.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.334
LET'S GO.
JESUS.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.239
[phone beeps]

26:47.273 --> 26:48.775
- JESSE, WHAT IS GOING ON?

26:48.808 --> 26:50.309
- HEY, WE'RE MAKING
ANOTHER RUN AT JAMES.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.177
YOU NEED TO GET MADDY AND
CHARLIE OUT OF THERE

26:51.210 --> 26:52.178
BEFORE WE DO.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.080
- WHAT?
THEY'RE INSIDE THE HOUSE

26:54.113 --> 26:56.515
WITH TWO ARMED GUARDS BECAUSE
SAM TOLD ME NOT TO SHOOT THEM.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.851
- I KNOW IT'S BAD, FI,
BUT THIS IS HAPPENING.

26:58.885 --> 27:03.022
- HOW LONG DO I HAVE?
- FIVE, MAYBE TEN MINUTES.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.925
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.461
[phone rings]

27:11.330 --> 27:12.932
- HELLO?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.267
- MADELINE, IT'S ME.
SAY, "HELLO, MRS. REYNOLDS."

27:15.301 --> 27:19.538
- OH, HI, MRS. REYNOLDS.
HOW ARE YOU?

27:19.571 --> 27:22.608
- LISTEN, I'M COMING IN TO GET
YOU AND CHARLIE.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.310
BUT I NEED YOU TO TELL ME WHERE
THOSE TWO MEN ARE POSITIONED.

27:24.343 --> 27:28.681
- OH, I'M JUST PUTTERING
AROUND THE KITCHEN.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.216
CHARLIE'S GREAT, YEAH.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.484
HE'S COLORING
OVER AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.386
- SO ARE THEY GUARDING
BOTH DOORS?

27:34.420 --> 27:35.387
- UH-HUH.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.957
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE CHARLIE
INTO THE SUNROOM.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.658
IN TEN MINUTES, I'M GONNA
COME IN FROM THE BACK

27:39.692 --> 27:40.727
AND TRY AND TO TAKE 'EM OUT

27:40.760 --> 27:42.294
BEFORE THEY KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.495
KEEP CHARLIE CLOSE.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.798
- I WILL.
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.399
- TRY TO FIND
SOME KIND OF WEAPON,

27:47.433 --> 27:50.136
JUST IN CASE.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.804
- OKAY, WILL DO.
[chuckles]

27:51.838 --> 27:56.242
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TALK AGAIN LATER.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.011
MY NEIGHBOR, MRS. REYNOLDS.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.247
SHE'S VISITING HER MOTHER
IN BOCA

28:01.280 --> 28:02.815
AND WANTS ME TO GO WATER
HER PLANTS

28:02.849 --> 28:05.251
AND TAKE IN THE MAIL TOMORROW.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.554
I'M ASSUMING THIS WILL
ALL BE OVER BY THEN.

28:13.292 --> 28:17.196
HEY, CHARLIE, SWEETHEART,
I THINK HE LIGHT'S

28:17.229 --> 28:18.597
A LOT BETTER IN THE SUNROOM.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.332
WHY DON'T WE GO COLOR
OVER THERE?

28:20.366 --> 28:21.567
TAKE THE CRAYONS, ALL RIGHT?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.970
THEN WE'LL COVER TOGETHER.
HERE WE GO.

28:30.743 --> 28:34.113
- DECENT COVER.
SOLID SIGHT LINES.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.182
THIS SHOULD DO JUST FINE.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.884
YOU STAY OVER THERE.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.286
PRETEND YOU'RE SHOOTING
AT SOMEBODY BEHIND THE BOAT.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.954
SONYA AND JAMES COME IN
TO HELP OUT.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.723
I SNEAK UP BEHIND THEM
AND DISABLE THEM.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.759
- "DISABLE" THEM?
- YEAH.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.861
I FIND PEOPLE EASIER TO CAPTURE
WHEN THEY CAN'T WALK.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.130
- SIMON, THAT'S NOT HOW
I OPERATE.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.364
- MM, I THOUGHT
WE COVERED THIS.

28:52.398 --> 28:56.435
I'M RUNNING THIS EXTRACTION
ON ORDERS OF THE CIA.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.470
- MICHAEL, YOU STILL
HANGING IN THERE?

28:58.504 --> 29:00.572
AS A SPY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR MISSION

29:00.606 --> 29:02.809
NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS.

29:02.842 --> 29:06.578
YEAH, JAMES, I'M JUST
INSIDE THE DOOR BY A BOAT.

29:06.612 --> 29:09.448
[gunshots]

29:09.481 --> 29:12.084
I'M--I'M ENGAGING
THREE HOSTILES.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.386
- WE'RE TWO MILES OUT.
WE'LL BE THERE SOON.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.722
- WAY TO SELL THE DEAL, MICHAEL.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.257
I DIDN'T EVEN NEED
THE SQUEALER'S HELP

29:18.290 --> 29:19.258
TO SEND IT OVER THE TOP.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.093
- THERE COMES A POINT, THOUGH,

29:21.127 --> 29:22.829
WHERE THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
ANYMORE,

29:22.862 --> 29:24.130
WHEN YOU'RE PUSHED
TO THE BREAKING POINT...

29:24.163 --> 29:27.900
SIMON, NO!

29:27.934 --> 29:29.468
AND BEYOND.

30:07.506 --> 30:10.476
- [pained cries]

30:12.912 --> 30:14.914
- AH!

30:24.556 --> 30:27.459
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE, MICHAEL.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.528
LET ME GO,
AND WE'LL FINISH THE JOB.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.797
THEN YOU'LL BE THE HERO.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.434
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU
ALWAYS WANTED, TO BE THE HERO?

30:38.204 --> 30:40.239
- NOT LIKE THIS.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.507
- [grunts]

30:41.540 --> 30:44.543
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

30:44.576 --> 30:47.679
[gasps]

31:16.542 --> 31:18.110
- OH, GOD.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.912
OVER HERE.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.614
- MICHAEL!

31:25.117 --> 31:27.453
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I TRIED TO SAVE THEM.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.122
WE WERE AMBUSHED.
- WE NEED TO PATCH YOU UP.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.891
- HERE. LET ME.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.626
- OWEN AND THE BOYS?

31:34.660 --> 31:38.330
- THEY WERE BRAVE.

31:39.565 --> 31:43.369
- SOMEONE WILL PAY.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.403
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED,
MICHAEL.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.972
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
SPLIT UP.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.907
- YOU CAME BACK, JAMES.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.542
- OF COURSE.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.345
- BRACE YOURSELF.
THIS WILL HURT.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.915
[phone beeps]

32:02.488 --> 32:04.991
- WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO SAVE SOMEONE

32:05.024 --> 32:07.459
FROM AN ENEMY
WITH SUPERIOR NUMBERS,

32:07.493 --> 32:10.596
THE CHALLENGE IS BEING
IN TWO PLACES AT THE SAME TIME.

32:16.535 --> 32:20.172
A WELL-PLACED
DIRECTIONAL CHARGE

32:20.206 --> 32:22.241
WILL TAKE OUT WINDOWS, WALLS,

32:22.274 --> 32:24.510
AND ANYONE STANDING
NEAR THEM.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.413
TIMED PRECISELY,
IT CAN GIVE YOU THE CHANCE

32:27.446 --> 32:29.815
TO ATTACK BOTH SIDES
OF A STRUCTURE AT ONCE.

32:29.848 --> 32:33.652
IF IT WORKS, YOU TAKE OUT
ALL THE HOSTILES INSIDE

32:33.685 --> 32:36.855
BEFORE THEY CAN HURT THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAVE.

32:36.888 --> 32:40.259
IF IT DOESN'T, YOU CREATE
ONE HELL OF A DEATH TRAP.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.029
- SOMETHING WRONG?
- SORRY, I'M KINDA NERVOUS.

32:43.062 --> 32:46.665
I'M ON MY LAST PACK
OF NICOTINE GUM.

32:46.698 --> 32:50.669
WITHDRAWAL IS
A B-I-T-C-H.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.786
- THERE'S THE EAST BOATHOUSE.
- OKAY, FI JUST TEXTED.

33:07.819 --> 33:08.887
SHE'S PULLING MADDY OUT
IN THREE MINUTES.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.356
- THEN WE BETTER GET THIS DONE
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.025
- ALL RIGHT, SAFETIES OFF,
HEADS DOWN.

33:13.059 --> 33:16.962
LET'S MOVE!

33:16.995 --> 33:19.798
- NOTHING ON THIS ONE EITHER.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.533
- THEY HAVE NO I.D.s,
NO PHONES,

33:21.567 --> 33:23.535
NOT EVEN ANY TATTOOS.
[camera shutter clicks]

33:23.569 --> 33:24.636
THESE GUYS WERE GHOSTS.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.372
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
SENT THEM?

33:26.405 --> 33:27.506
- I DON'T KNOW.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.007
[camera shutter clicks]

33:29.041 --> 33:30.209
- YOU STILL THERE?

33:30.242 --> 33:32.978
I JUST SENT YOU PICTURES
OF THE HIT SQUAD.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.514
I WANT THEM IDENTIFIED ASAP.
THANK YOU.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.016
WE'LL BE ABOUT AN HOUR.
ALL RIGHT.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.086
LET'S GO.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.393
- THE THING THAT KEEPS
YOU GOING

33:47.426 --> 33:49.895
IN A DEEP-COVER MISSION
IS KNOWING THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING

33:49.928 --> 33:51.697
FOR SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN,

33:51.730 --> 33:54.400
THAT THE PEOPLE YOU WORK FOR
HAVE YOUR BACK.

33:54.433 --> 33:58.036
BUT WHEN YOUR OWN SIDE BETRAYS
WHAT THEY CLAIM TO STAND FOR,

33:58.070 --> 33:59.505
WHEN THEY'RE WILLING
TO DO THINGS

33:59.538 --> 34:01.440
EVEN YOUR ENEMIES
WOULDN'T DREAM OF,

34:01.473 --> 34:03.742
EVERYTHING STARTS
TO FALL APART.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.078
AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN
TO THAT FINAL MOMENT,

34:06.112 --> 34:09.348
SOMETIMES YOU CAN SURPRISE
EVEN YOURSELF.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.717
WAIT. WAIT!

34:11.750 --> 34:13.685
WAIT.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.920
- WHAT IS IT?

34:14.953 --> 34:18.690
- THIS MIGHT BE NOTHING,
BUT THIS ONE WAS CALLING IN

34:18.724 --> 34:20.692
FOR A SUPPORT TEAM
DURING THE FIREFIGHT.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.727
IF BACKUP'S ON THE WAY,

34:21.760 --> 34:23.762
THEY'LL BE COMING
FROM THAT ROAD.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.298
- IS THAT ARM GOOD ENOUGH
TO SWIM?

34:26.332 --> 34:27.699
- WE'LL FIND OUT.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.769
- LET'S GO OUT BACK.

34:39.845 --> 34:43.615
- MICHAEL. MICHAEL!

34:45.184 --> 34:46.652
- HE'S GONE.

34:46.685 --> 34:47.786
- NO SIGN OF JAMES
OR SONJA EITHER.

34:47.819 --> 34:48.787
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?

34:48.820 --> 34:50.622
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

34:50.656 --> 34:51.723
YOU PUT AN OP IN THE HANDS
OF A PSYCHO,

34:51.757 --> 34:53.892
AND IT BLEW UP
IN OUR FACES.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.661
- OH, JESUS,
I GOTTA CALL FI.

34:57.963 --> 35:00.999
[cell phone vibrating]

35:01.032 --> 35:02.634
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I'M JUST ABOUT TO--

35:02.668 --> 35:04.069
- NO, STOP WHATEVER
YOU'RE DOING.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.637
MIKE AND JAMES DISAPPEARED
ON US.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.839
- AGAIN?
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:07.873 --> 35:09.241
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE LOST 'EM.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.843
- MADELINE AND CHARLIE
ARE STILL INSIDE.

35:11.877 --> 35:12.844
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

35:12.878 --> 35:13.679
- GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.680
THE OPERATION'S NOT OVER.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.448
- JESSE, I JUST SET A CHARGE.

35:16.482 --> 35:19.050
- YOU GOTTA GET RID
OF IT NOW, RIGHT NOW.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.825
[beep]

35:29.695 --> 35:31.797
[clatter]

35:31.830 --> 35:33.965
- WHAT WAS THAT?

35:33.999 --> 35:38.804
- YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

35:38.837 --> 35:40.739
- STAY THERE.
BE RIGHT BACK.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.487
- IT'S NOTHING.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.828
- MUST BE MY NEIGHBOR'S CAT.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.796
I GIVE THE OLD FLEABAG MILK
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

36:04.830 --> 36:07.065
NOW HE WANTS ME
TO ADOPT HIM.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.857
- GLAD YOU MADE IT, SIR.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

36:31.890 --> 36:33.892
- I'VE SEEN BETTER DAYS.
DISPOSE OF THE VEHICLE.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.060
- RIGHT AWAY.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.428
- I'LL CHECK TO SEE
IF THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS

36:36.462 --> 36:37.529
IDENTIFYING THE PHOTOS.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.731
- SONYA, LEAVE THAT BE.
COME WITH ME.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.868
MICHAEL, JOIN US.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.379
- WHAT'S GOING ON, JAMES?

36:53.412 --> 36:56.582
- WELL, WE DON'T NEED PHOTOS
TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID THIS.

36:56.615 --> 37:01.186
I THINK WE KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE TO FIND THAT INFORMATION.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.954
- WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

37:02.988 --> 37:06.725
- PLEASE...

37:06.758 --> 37:08.360
DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER
THAN IS HAS TO BE.

37:08.394 --> 37:12.531
- MAKE WHAT HARDER?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.433
JAMES, YOU'RE SCARING ME.
- SONYA...

37:14.466 --> 37:17.869
ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
KNEW EXACTLY

37:17.903 --> 37:20.872
WHERE WE'D BE TODAY.

37:20.906 --> 37:26.445
ME...AND YOU.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.913
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:27.946 --> 37:31.149
- JAMES, PUT THE GUN DOWN.
- YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, MICHAEL.

37:31.182 --> 37:33.885
'CAUSE I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.754
AND MICHAEL HERE, HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE WE'D BE.

37:35.787 --> 37:36.888
NEITHER DID THESE MEN.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.625
AND EVERYONE ELSE
ON THE MISSION IS DEAD.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.126
- I WOULD NEVER BETRAY YOU.

37:41.159 --> 37:42.428
- WHO DID YOU TELL?
- NO ONE.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.330
- WHO DID YOU TELL?
- NO ONE, I SWEAR IT!

37:44.363 --> 37:46.832
- CALM DOWN.
IT'S POSSIBLE SHE'S NOT LYING.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.435
SOMEBODY COULD HAVE HACK--
- NO WAY IN HELL.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.002
NOBODY GETS THAT CLOSE TO US.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.672
SOMEONE MAKE YOU
A BETTER OFFER?

37:53.705 --> 37:54.906
IS THIS A POWER PLAY
TO TAKE OVER?

37:54.940 --> 37:55.907
BECAUSE I WOULD
RESPECT IT.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.643
COULDN'T TOLERATE IT.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.678
WHATEVER YOUR PLAN WAS,
IT FAILED.

37:59.711 --> 38:03.081
- I WAS TORTURED FOR US,
YOU KNOW THAT.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.852
I HELPED BUILD ALL OF THIS.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.288
- AND THAT, MY DEAR,

38:10.322 --> 38:12.157
IS WHAT MAKES THIS
SO VERY HARD.

38:12.190 --> 38:15.994
MM, SEE, I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

38:16.027 --> 38:19.097
WHAT YOU'VE COMPROMISED.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.466
- [nervous chuckle]

38:20.499 --> 38:24.035
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
FIVE SECONDS TO COME CLEAN

38:24.069 --> 38:26.104
BEFORE THIS BECOMES
A LOT MORE PAINFUL.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.506
NOW, WHO ARE YOU
WORKING WITH?

38:27.539 --> 38:31.643
- PLEASE.
- WHO WERE THOSE MEN?

38:31.677 --> 38:33.379
FIVE, FOUR, THREE...
- JAMES, I DON'T KNOW.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.647
I DON'T KNOW.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.383
- TALK TO ME! TWO...
- JAMES.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.819
- STAY OUT OF THIS, MICHAEL.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.956
[cocks gun]
ONE.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.726
- SHE DIDN'T BETRAY YOU.
I DID.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.400
I'M WORKING WITH THE CIA.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.740
- I COPIED THE INFORMATION
OFF HER CELL PHONE

39:01.773 --> 39:03.208
WHILE SHE SLEPT.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.176
I MADE A DROP
TO MY CIA CONTACT

39:05.210 --> 39:08.013
WITH ALL THE DATA
LATER THAT MORNING.

39:08.046 --> 39:11.249
- SONYA KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS?

39:13.051 --> 39:15.053
- NO.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.228
- HOW LONG YOU BEEN
WITH THE CIA?

39:23.261 --> 39:26.164
- THE WHOLE TIME, JAMES.
WHAT'S THE POINT?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.433
IF YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME,
GET IT OVER WITH.

39:27.466 --> 39:30.402
- YOU THINK YOU GET OFF
THAT EASY?

39:30.436 --> 39:32.771
GOOD MEN DIED TODAY
BECAUSE OF YOU.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.607
HOW DARE YOU FIGHT
ALONGSIDE OF US LIKE A BROTHER?

39:35.641 --> 39:36.942
HOW COULD YOU?

39:36.975 --> 39:38.343
- IT WAS PART OF MY COVER.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.678
I MADE A DEAL WITH THE CIA

39:39.711 --> 39:42.380
TO KEEP MY FRIENDS OUT OF JAIL.
I HAD TO SELL IT.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.582
AH!

39:43.615 --> 39:45.784
- YOU'RE HOLDING BACK
ON ME, MICHAEL.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.887
YOU SAVED MEN'S LIVES,
YOU KILLED FOR US.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.622
NO MAN IS THAT GOOD A LIAR.

39:50.656 --> 39:53.725
YOU'RE A BELIEVER.
I SAW THE FIRE IN YOUR EYES.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.761
- YES, BUT THE THINGS YOU DID,
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH ALL OF THEM,

39:55.794 --> 39:58.697
BUT...YOU BELIEVED
IN SOMETHING.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.767
YOU STOOD FOR SOMETHING.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.610
- THE CIA WAS WAITING

40:11.643 --> 40:14.913
OUTSIDE THE BOATHOUSE TODAY,
WEREN'T THEY?

40:14.946 --> 40:16.948
- YEAH.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.484
- YOU COULD HAVE COMPLETED
YOUR MISSION.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.586
YOU COULD HAVE GOT
YOUR FRIENDS OFF THE HOOK.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.822
AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
LET US WALK OUT THE DOOR.

40:26.492 --> 40:30.562
BUT YOU DIDN'T.
WHY?

40:30.596 --> 40:33.198
- CAN WE JUST END THIS, PLEASE?

40:44.710 --> 40:47.813
- NOT UNTIL...
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH

40:47.846 --> 40:49.748
FOR THE FIRST GODDAMN TIME
IN YOUR LIFE.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.984
WHY DIDN'T YOU COMPLETE
YOUR MISSION?

40:53.018 --> 40:57.288
- BECAUSE THE MAN
THEY SENT AFTER YOU--SIMON.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.357
BECAUSE IF THEY WORKED
WITH HIM,

40:59.390 --> 41:00.792
THEY BELIEVE IN NOTHING.

41:00.826 --> 41:01.827
AND I BELIEVED.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.929
I BELIEVED FROM THE FIRST DAY

41:03.962 --> 41:05.864
OF MY TRAINING AT THE CIA.

41:05.897 --> 41:11.169
I THOUGHT ALL THEY STOOD FOR
WAS RIGHT.

41:11.202 --> 41:15.674
EVEN AFTER THEY BURNED ME!

41:15.707 --> 41:18.977
I GAVE UP EVERYTHING!

41:19.010 --> 41:24.983
AND I WASTED MY LIFE...
FOR A LIE.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.399
- JAMES, ARE YOU SATISFIED?

41:45.737 --> 41:51.643
- NO, SONYA.

41:51.677 --> 41:55.881
NOT YET.
