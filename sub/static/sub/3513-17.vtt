WEBVTT

00:25.792 --> 00:27.066
Never lose this.

00:28.261 --> 00:29.706
Guard it with your life.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.558
My apologies, sir.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.228
I was told to use
force if necessary.

01:28.354 --> 01:32.097
Knowing you as I do,
I found it necessary.

01:34.327 --> 01:35.635
Good to see you, too, Woolsey.

01:35.962 --> 01:37.566
Your cousin would like to see you.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.904
He's here? Yes, sir.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.035
And waiting.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.101
I must be important, then.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.272
Afraid so, sir. And I'm
afraid you'll have to drive.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.648
Better than having to die,
I suppose.

01:48.141 --> 01:50.951
Just between us, sir,
I wouldn't rule that out.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.873
Hey. I'm sorry. Am I late?

02:48.935 --> 02:50.676
You will be if you don't
get your butt home.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.114
We have reservations.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.980
My butt is on its way.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.883
Okay. See you soon.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.808
I was doing just fine.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.283
Until I had a gun
pressed against my neck

03:27.340 --> 03:29.251
by a man I've known
for nearly 20 years.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.520
It's nothing personal, sir.
I know, Woolsey.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.852
But I'm taking it that way.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.823
No hard feelings, sir.
Your privilege.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.191
Sorry for the blunt force, Sean.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.530
Couldn't take the chance that
you might refuse the invitation.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.122
My time is very limited.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.799
What do you want?

03:43.856 --> 03:46.928
It's not just me, cousin.
It's the family.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.231
We're very concerned. Things are not
moving the way that they should be.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.741
You've come a long way for nothing.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.607
I never go anywhere for nothing.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.806
So, the choices are
give us the key,

03:57.337 --> 03:59.078
or we'll take the Grimm
and find it ourselves.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.515
We're tired of waiting.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.444
What do you think I've been doing
all this time, playing croquet?

04:03.776 --> 04:06.723
Some of us actually put some thought
into what we do before we do it.

04:06.779 --> 04:09.988
No one is interested
in excuses anymore.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.421
We want answers, cousin.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.226
We want action.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.357
All right.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.182
My answer is no, by the way.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.949
You may want to relay
that to the family.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.150
I think the message is clear, sir.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.247
If I tell them, they'll kill me.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.687
You've got a point there, Woolsey.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.189
Sorry. It's nothing personal.

04:44.917 --> 04:48.194
I know, sir.
But I'm taking it that way.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.859
Your privilege.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.699
I can't believe he
didn't say anything.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.172
Don't you guys ever talk
about anything but work?

04:56.229 --> 04:57.503
Yeah. Sure we do.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.565
You know, he lost $80 on
the Blazers game last week.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.373
That got very emotional.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.878
He didn't even mention her name?

05:03.936 --> 05:05.643
Not to me.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.775
You're the one who set this up.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.318
He didn't say anything
to you, either?

05:08.408 --> 05:11.389
I didn't set it up.
He set it up, and he's very excited.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.250
No, he didn't say anything.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.623
Well, you'd think he'd at least
mention the money he lost.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.457
Ah, men.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.500
Hey' guys.

05:23.556 --> 05:26.594
Nick. I think you remember Adalind.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.510
Nice to see you again.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.654
And this is the lovely Juliette.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.721
It's a pleasure to meet you.

05:54.787 --> 05:55.822
You, too.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.027
Excuse me. I'm going
to grab our table.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.771
Hank tells me that you're
a veterinarian. Yeah.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.834
I have an Egyptian Mau cat.
It's just my best friend.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.010
Wow. You really don't
see those very often.

06:09.135 --> 06:11.911
Yeah, maybe that's because
they're so dangerous.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.945
They are descended from wild African cats.
Good job. Very ancient breed.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.612
I've only seen one in my practice.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.556
They have a really cool mark on their
forehead like a little scarab beetle.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.115
They have a little mark
underneath their tongue?

06:25.418 --> 06:26.590
I've never looked.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.256
That's a weird question.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.732
Hey, guys. Got our table.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.133
You guys ready to have
a good time? Yeah.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.192
Okay.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.382
I was afraid you weren't coming.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.552
I was held up.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.290
Everything okay? Why?

06:59.786 --> 07:01.595
You have the smell of violence.

07:02.622 --> 07:03.828
And you have a problem with that.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.064
I never have.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.908
I started in criminal law.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.879
Thought I'd be the
next Clarence Darrow.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.416
But wouldn't you know it...

07:19.472 --> 07:21.315
I ended up spending all
my time with criminals.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.911
So, I, uh,
switched to contract law.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.885
Still criminals,
but they dress better.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.219
And they pay better.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.315
Sometimes.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.985
Must have been pretty
tough at the law firm.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.222
I suppose you had to
hire some new lawyers.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.188
I'm still getting over that loss.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.093
What loss? I'm feeling
a little left out.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.638
Two of the lawyers from
her firm were murdered.

07:41.727 --> 07:44.571
Oh, Nick told me a
little bit about that.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.141
I'm sorry.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.546
You were really upset
about that case.

07:48.734 --> 07:49.940
Yeah, I still am.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.682
I'm sorry.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.309
Oh. You know, this is the office.
I have to take this.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.712
Could you order me another drink?

07:56.776 --> 07:58.653
Of course I can. Thank you. Hello?

07:58.711 --> 08:00.156
I could use one myself.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.818
She seems nice.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.155
Hmm. She is.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.218
The thing about her
is she's genuine.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.030
Grew up with her grandparents
on a farm in Iowa.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.395
Put herself through law school.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.328
It sounds a little
too good to be true.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.525
Hey.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.367
I put myself through vet school.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.373
Could you order me
another drink, too?

08:18.431 --> 08:20.172
I've got to use the restroom.

08:22.535 --> 08:25.106
Sorry. Nick seems a little
edgy tonight. Yeah, he does.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.208
I think you guys have been
working a little too hard.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.247
So, how long has this been going
on between you and Miss Adalind?

08:30.376 --> 08:31.650
Not that long.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.116
It's the weirdest thing.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.157
It's like one day, I woke up and I

08:37.917 --> 08:39.453
couldn't stop thinking about her.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.229
Yeah, I know how that goes.

08:41.953 --> 08:46.369
Yes. Okay. I can do the deposition
between 3:00 and 5:00 tomorrow.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.564
Just, uh, let me know what you...

08:49.128 --> 08:50.505
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

08:51.264 --> 08:53.835
Falling in love. I didn't
know that was against the law.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.470
I'm going to say this once.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.070
You stay out of his life.

08:58.504 --> 08:59.881
Hey.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.643
I hope you're listening.

09:03.643 --> 09:07.056
Did it ever occur to you that this
is exactly what it looks like?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.481
No.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.761
Never. You're a liar.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.818
Because I'm not telling
him everything?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.523
I guess you speak from experience.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.696
I'm not going to let this happen.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.633
Try and stop it.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.104
Maybe I should scream.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.095
I can't believe it.
We got a damn call.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.524
Got two dead bodies.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.964
Good. I'm taking
Juliette home first.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.959
Hey, man. What's the deal?

09:52.959 --> 09:55.530
Look, it's just something going
on between me and Juliette.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.268
And I don't really
want to get into it.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.638
Okay, I get it.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.041
I'll take care of things
until you get there.

10:07.373 --> 10:10.911
If Adalind does this,
my debt is paid.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.989
Yes.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.620
And if she doesn't?

10:17.850 --> 10:19.386
Just kidding.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.424
But I'm disappointed.

10:22.655 --> 10:23.861
About what?

10:24.390 --> 10:26.734
You used to be a lot more fun.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.240
I can still be fun if I want to.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.238
Right now, there's too
much riding on this.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.374
I need you to make sure this
happens the way it has to.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.484
Well, it's a good thing
you came to a pro.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.785
Sometimes Adalind has
a mind of her own.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.532
I don't want any mistakes
on this, Catherine.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.164
You may want to spend a little
less time gazing at that

10:58.224 --> 10:59.669
mirror, mirror on the wall.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.131
Well, dagger, dagger in my heart.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.575
What happens when you find the key?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.808
Well, those who help will
be remembered and rewarded.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.082
Those who don't will be forgotten.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.728
Two dead bodies.
Two guns. One Mercedes.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.097
Wu.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.843
What? You just ate your chap stick.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.178
No, I didn't.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.737
I saw you.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.306
That's crazy. Why would I do that?

11:46.372 --> 11:50.149
Okay. So, the older guy's a Brit.
Thomas Woolsey.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.587
And the other guy is
Anton Krug. He's Swiss.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.153
Both have guns in their hands,

11:55.214 --> 11:58.195
so a simple-minded sergeant would
surmise they shot each other.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.729
Fortunately, that's not my job.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.389
I'm going to run prints.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.290
What do you think?

12:04.356 --> 12:05.892
I don't know. I just got here.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.466
About Adalind.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.437
I've got to be honest with you,
Hank. I, um...

12:12.531 --> 12:14.067
I don't see this one working out.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.510
What are you talking about?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.707
Look, I... I know you're afraid
I might take advantage of her

12:17.770 --> 12:20.717
because we saved her life,
but it's not like that.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.483
What if she takes advantage of you?

12:24.009 --> 12:25.181
Works for me.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.982
Look, Hank.

12:29.014 --> 12:31.153
We're cops. We can't do this.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.992
We've got to keep it separate.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.229
On the other hand,
life is short, buddy.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.789
And I'm not getting
married tomorrow.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.931
Just get to know her.
You might like her.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.480
Hey, got a cell phone.
Somebody bring me a baggie.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.585
What?

13:28.707 --> 13:30.709
Making any progress on
the double homicide?

13:30.776 --> 13:34.019
Yeah, not much. We've got two foreigners,
one Swiss, one British,

13:34.079 --> 13:36.059
who decided to shoot
each other in Portland.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.618
According to the rental
agreement found in the Mercedes,

13:38.684 --> 13:39.890
it was rented to Anton Krug.

13:39.952 --> 13:41.795
But the keys were found
in Woolsey's pocket.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.424
Right. So, they
either knew each other

13:43.489 --> 13:44.832
or one was trying to steal
the car from the other.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.198
Well, they had to
have known each other.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.795
According to the airlines,
they both flew in together today.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.033
And there was only one car.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.369
So, obviously, they drove together.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.500
Uh-huh. Well, it makes sense.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.909
Unless there was a second
car and somebody drove away.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.673
What are you saying, a third man?

13:57.937 --> 13:59.075
You got any evidence of this?

13:59.138 --> 14:00.173
Not yet.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.344
Could have been a business
dispute that got out of hand.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.581
Can you connect them
to anybody here?

14:05.244 --> 14:07.349
We did find this cell
phone underneath the car.

14:07.446 --> 14:10.984
We think it must have fallen out of
Anton's pocket when he hit the ground.

14:12.251 --> 14:13.753
You, uh, access that yet?

14:13.819 --> 14:14.957
We haven't been able to turn it on.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.499
We think it broke when
it hit the ground.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.057
The lab will be able to
get that information.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.194
Good. Good. Keep me advised.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.334
Gentlemen.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.504
And you two as well.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.370
Waits for laugh. Doesn't get it.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.608
All right. According
to the airline records,

14:31.670 --> 14:34.947
which I just received and happened
to peruse while in the restroom,

14:35.007 --> 14:37.544
both your victims declared the
guns they used to shoot each other

14:37.610 --> 14:39.283
when they checked in for
their flight from Zurich.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.756
So my guess is

14:41.547 --> 14:43.254
the two guns knew each other.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.830
Waits for laugh again.
Taps on fake microphone.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.025
Is this thing even on? Hello?

14:49.088 --> 14:50.465
Oh, man. It must be late.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.468
Look, let's pick this
up tomorrow. I'm beat.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.765
Plus, I'm pissed I missed
my dinner with Adalind.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.032
Hey, don't worry. I'll take
that phone down to evidence.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.770
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

15:00.165 --> 15:01.405
See you mañana.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.681
Are you okay? Yeah.

15:10.242 --> 15:13.382
Well, no. I've been having
some stomach problems lately.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.924
Well, maybe it's something you ate.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.985
No, I've been eating
pretty good lately.

15:19.385 --> 15:20.728
Although I have gained some weight.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.127
Huh.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.296
Hey, Nick, you know what? What?

15:26.859 --> 15:28.361
I think I'm going to pass out.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.534
Hey. Wu! Somebody call a medic.

15:35.534 --> 15:36.740
Medic! Please!

15:36.802 --> 15:38.440
Wu, can you hear me?

15:39.638 --> 15:40.708
It's going to be okay.

16:01.727 --> 16:02.831
Mom.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.937
Hello, precious.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.839
I hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.310
You're lucky I didn't
rip your throat out.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.903
As if you could have.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.906
I heard you got
yourself a new beau.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.543
It's not like that. I'm working.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.621
Of course you are. The Captain?

16:17.676 --> 16:18.677
Yes.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.381
Then you better make sure that
everything goes the way he wants.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.388
I am, Mom.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.159
You still love him, don't you?

16:27.052 --> 16:29.054
What difference does that make?

16:29.488 --> 16:30.899
I taught you well.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.563
There's one more thing.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.629
My new beau is the
partner of the Grimm.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.368
Then, this is about more
than just the partner.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.503
This is about getting the key.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.910
You're really going all
the way on this one.

16:46.071 --> 16:49.245
All I know is this
is going to get ugly.

16:49.908 --> 16:52.787
Don't worry. You do ugly so well.

16:56.582 --> 16:57.890
One second.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.458
It's him.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.993
Well, what did you expect?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.428
Go ahead. Answer it.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.502
Put on a smile.
They can hear it in your voice.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.140
Hank. Hi.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.439
Adalind.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.142
Sorry we had to duck away.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.510
We had a double homicide.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.810
Anyway, you don't want
to hear about that.

17:21.272 --> 17:25.118
Uh... I was on my way home, and thought
I might stop by for a few minutes.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.114
I'd love that, Hank.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.159
Oh. Great.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.285
But my mom's here.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.159
And we haven't seen
each other in a while.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.492
Maybe some other time?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.701
Sure. I understand.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.699
You know, I like that Juliette.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.803
I hope we can finish
that dinner sometime.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.539
Me, too. I'll call you tomorrow.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.271
Don't forget. Bye.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.180
There's an eating
disorder called pica.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.247
It usually involves consuming
non-edible substances.

18:01.313 --> 18:03.987
Dirt, coins and
other small objects.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.989
We discovered some
gastrointestinal obstruction.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.532
Fortunately, there was no
tearing of the stomach,

18:09.588 --> 18:11.397
and this is what we got out of him.

18:14.393 --> 18:15.633
He ate all that?

18:15.727 --> 18:17.764
Well, now you know why he
wasn't feeling so good.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.902
Why would he do this?
Lots of reasons.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.674
You're in a very stressful job.
That could be enough.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.009
We'll keep him overnight.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.708
He should be good
to go home tomorrow,

18:26.772 --> 18:28.445
but he's got to get some help.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.920
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.184
You're telling me.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.491
So just warn him off her, dude.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.024
Yeah, well, I've tried.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.429
But he won't listen to anything
I have to say about her.

18:42.488 --> 18:46.231
You know, plus, how do you tell
your partner he's dating a witch?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.897
You mean so he doesn't
hate you? Not easy.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.231
But this is not normal.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.469
You don't date a
Hexenbiest lightly.

18:53.532 --> 18:56.411
And you break up with
one at your own peril.

18:57.035 --> 18:58.571
Could she have done
something to him?

18:59.304 --> 19:00.544
Hell, yeah.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.443
That's what they do.

19:04.576 --> 19:07.318
Looks like somebody took a bite
out of the wrong apple, dude.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.217
Classic witch's brew.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.957
Mojo, juju, hocus-pocus,
booga-booga.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.121
Whatever you want to call it.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.755
They've got some pretty
potent concoctions

19:14.820 --> 19:16.959
that can seriously mess
with your brain chemistry.

19:17.022 --> 19:18.365
That would explain it.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.197
Rosalie would know about this.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.799
I could call her.
Uh, she's probably asleep by now.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.273
Not that that ever bothered you.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.468
Call her.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.406
It's got to be a
potion of some kind.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.951
How else would a human fall
in love with a Hexenbiest?

20:09.007 --> 20:12.113
They're not exactly
the lovable type.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.813
Kind of hot, though.

20:15.447 --> 20:18.428
I mean, if you go for
that obviously hot thing.

20:18.483 --> 20:19.757
Because I don't.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.525
Who's the Hexenbiest?

20:21.787 --> 20:23.095
Adalind Schade.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.063
How long ago did this happen?

20:25.691 --> 20:27.671
I'm guessing a couple of weeks.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.362
About the time Freddy was killed.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.940
Let me check his sales books.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.240
See if she's been here.
You guys keep looking.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.406
How many of these
zaubertrank are there?

20:39.771 --> 20:41.444
Uh, zaubertrank means potion.

20:41.506 --> 20:42.610
Yep.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.881
Yeah Wouldn't it just
be easier to say potion?

20:45.544 --> 20:46.955
Then why don't you just say that?

20:47.012 --> 20:49.288
Because it's so
much more than that.

20:49.348 --> 20:52.352
It's wie durch Zauber,
ein Zaubertrank.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.820
Hey, I've got something.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.458
A shopping list somebody wrote
from the day my brother died.

20:58.957 --> 21:02.166
Coeur diable, rot inguen,
and essigblasse.

21:02.227 --> 21:06.369
These are three of the ingredients
of a really dangerous recipe.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.870
Uh, how dangerous?

21:10.202 --> 21:13.240
From deeply in love to deeply dead.

21:14.706 --> 21:17.186
Looks like the Hexenbiest
that tried to kill your aunt

21:17.242 --> 21:19.119
has set her fangs
on your partner now.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.449
Well, how do we cure that?

21:21.513 --> 21:22.856
I'm not sure we can. It's...

21:22.914 --> 21:27.056
It depends on how far along the emotional
and physical relationship has gone.

21:27.185 --> 21:28.562
Too far, and he's...

21:29.121 --> 21:30.657
Toast? Yeah.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.025
Okay. Well,
we have to do something.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.502
There might be an antidote,

21:34.559 --> 21:35.867
but it would take me
a while to find it.

21:35.927 --> 21:39.067
First, I have to find out which
zaubertrank uses this recipe.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.289
It would help if I knew
what I was looking for.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.460
Any recipe with those ingredients.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.772
There's, like,
1,000 recipes in here.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.705
Remember the cop who got poisoned?

22:11.763 --> 22:15.233
Boil dude? Yeah.
Never forgetting that.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.438
Remember I was saying that
it's like the boomerang effect

22:17.502 --> 22:21.348
that happens when someone ingests
a potion meant for someone else.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.280
And you think that
someone else was Hank.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.352
Makes sense. Right?

22:27.846 --> 22:30.759
Does anything make sense
with a zaubertrank?

22:31.450 --> 22:32.895
Real love is hard to find.

22:33.719 --> 22:34.959
Don't I know it.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.602
How much longer do I
have to keep them on?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.141
I wear them for a
half hour every night.

22:49.901 --> 22:50.902
It hurts.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.576
Beauty is never without pain.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.675
You should be used to that by now.

22:58.810 --> 22:59.811
Yes?

23:00.679 --> 23:02.249
Time to set things in motion.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.760
Now? Yes. Now.

23:06.017 --> 23:08.019
He wants it to happen now.

23:08.153 --> 23:11.862
Well, all I can say is this
detective is one lucky guy.

23:12.124 --> 23:15.071
You're going to be the most
beautiful girl he's ever seen.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.087
Hey, morning.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.683
You forgot to take the cell phone
down to evidence last night.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.350
I dropped it this morning.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.556
Sorry. I got distracted
when Wu passed out.

23:41.052 --> 23:44.090
Yeah, I heard about that.
How's he doing? Better.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.363
How are you? Uh, not so good.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.096
Why? What's up? Flowers.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.468
Come again? I should
have sent flowers.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.409
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:54.466 --> 23:56.605
At dinner the other night
when we got called away,

23:56.768 --> 23:59.078
I should have sent
Adalind some flowers.

23:59.704 --> 24:01.308
Don't you think?

24:01.540 --> 24:03.451
Hank, don't you see
what's going on here?

24:03.508 --> 24:04.851
She's calling.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.414
Hey, baby. How you doing?

24:08.380 --> 24:10.451
Well... What's wrong?

24:10.582 --> 24:12.391
I just miss you.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.286
I miss you, too.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.391
Maybe you'd like to come
over to my place tonight.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.766
I'd love that.
What do you want me to bring?

24:20.225 --> 24:22.933
Just yourself.
Are you with your partner?

24:22.994 --> 24:24.940
Yeah, he's sitting
right here. Good.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.402
Tell him I say hi.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.038
She says hi.

24:28.099 --> 24:29.908
Let me say hi.

24:33.271 --> 24:36.411
Adalind. Sorry about the
other night. How are you?

24:36.541 --> 24:38.851
I'm fine, Nick. How are you?

24:38.944 --> 24:41.447
So. What are you cooking
for dinner tonight?

24:41.513 --> 24:42.753
It's a surprise.

24:43.348 --> 24:45.021
And what have you
done to my partner?

24:45.851 --> 24:48.092
You've really got
him under a spell.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.099
That's your surprise.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.933
Come on. Phone back. My turn.

24:54.926 --> 24:55.996
I'll see you tonight.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.132
Can't wait.

25:00.131 --> 25:01.474
Very good, Adalind.

25:03.902 --> 25:07.611
You are incredibly powerful.

25:08.907 --> 25:10.147
She's cooking dinner
for me tonight.

25:10.308 --> 25:11.378
That's a good sign,
don't you think?

25:11.510 --> 25:14.582
Well, that really depends
on what she's cooking.

25:17.048 --> 25:18.823
Look, Hank.

25:19.651 --> 25:21.028
I know you probably
don't want to hear this.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.429
We finished with the cell phone.

25:22.487 --> 25:26.060
It's definitely busted. But I thought
I should bring it over personally.

25:26.324 --> 25:27.394
Why?

25:27.659 --> 25:28.763
Nothing on it.

25:29.427 --> 25:31.703
SIM card is empty.
Brand new, never been used.

25:32.664 --> 25:34.610
That's not a new phone.
Why is there a new card?

25:34.666 --> 25:36.942
Hmm. Maybe the old one was damaged.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.345
Anyway, that's all we got.

25:41.806 --> 25:43.217
Old phone, new SIM card.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.119
We have no contacts from
Portland or anywhere else.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.791
Is this seeming as strange
to you as it is to me?

25:48.847 --> 25:49.917
Yeah.

25:49.981 --> 25:51.585
Then something is not right.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.391
But I can make it up to her.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.130
I take her flowers tonight.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.561
Hank. Two dozen.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.869
Red.

26:12.637 --> 26:14.139
I found it.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.015
I found it. Monroe.

26:17.108 --> 26:18.985
Wake up. Where am I?

26:27.085 --> 26:28.689
Death for love.

26:32.123 --> 26:34.194
Captain, you got a minute?

26:34.526 --> 26:35.869
Yeah. Of course.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.071
Something's bothering
me about this shooting.

26:43.134 --> 26:44.704
You find something out?

26:44.769 --> 26:47.875
No, that's just it.
lt just... It seems too clean.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.813
Now, we sent the phone
down to the lab.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.617
But it's an old phone,
got a brand new SIM card.

26:53.678 --> 26:55.419
Not a single phone call on it.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.687
That is odd. What are you thinking?

26:58.416 --> 27:00.760
Well... Now, this is
just instinct, but...

27:01.820 --> 27:03.026
I think there was a third man.

27:06.324 --> 27:07.701
I think he drove a separate car.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.102
I think he could
have shot both men.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.273
I think he took Anton's gun,
put it in his hand,

27:12.330 --> 27:13.707
shot the gun again,

27:13.765 --> 27:15.108
putting powder burns on Anton...

27:15.166 --> 27:17.703
Then took Anton's phone,
replaced the SIM card

27:17.769 --> 27:18.941
and tossed it under the car.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.306
Preventing us from getting
any of Anton's contacts,

27:21.373 --> 27:23.444
which might connect
us to this third man.

27:23.508 --> 27:24.782
Right.

27:25.543 --> 27:27.318
Any idea how to find out who he is?

27:27.612 --> 27:31.389
I'm working on it, but... You know,
I feel like I'm getting really close.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.095
Look, Nick,
you're a great detective.

27:35.153 --> 27:38.259
And this is a very
good theory. But, um...

27:38.690 --> 27:41.864
The families of the victims are
already en route to claim the bodies.

27:42.293 --> 27:45.706
It turns out the two men had very strong
political connections back in Europe,

27:45.764 --> 27:47.266
and their families
have no intention

27:47.332 --> 27:49.369
of letting us get
involved in their affairs.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.107
Well, even if that means
a murderer goes free?

27:51.169 --> 27:52.807
I don't like it any
more than you do.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.952
But sometimes the bigger picture is

27:56.341 --> 27:58.150
complicated by things
beyond our control.

28:06.584 --> 28:07.585
Burkhardt

28:07.852 --> 28:09.422
Hey, man. I'm with Rosalie.

28:09.621 --> 28:10.759
You might want to get over here.

28:10.822 --> 28:13.132
Because if Hank's taken
what we think he's taken,

28:13.758 --> 28:15.669
he is knocking on heaven's door.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.773
Coeur diable, rot inguen,
and essigblasse.

28:24.836 --> 28:26.816
They're all part of
an obsession formula.

28:26.938 --> 28:30.147
The heart-sucking, brain-mashing
zaubertrank we were talking about.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.052
The spell is designed to
cause obsessive behavior.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.886
The obsession becomes so great

28:34.946 --> 28:38.018
that the brain overloads and
the body literally shuts down.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.562
It could explain what
happened to your...

28:39.617 --> 28:41.096
Sergeant Wu. Yeah.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.689
His fever and lesions
suggest that he got

28:43.755 --> 28:45.257
some of the zaubertrank
meant for Hank.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.062
This is what I think they took.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.440
Well, I thought you cured Wu.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.601
I just treated his symptoms.

28:54.666 --> 28:58.409
Could it explain eating coins,
paper clips, uh, buttons?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.607
Unfortunately. Yes.

29:01.272 --> 29:03.616
How do we stop this?
There's an antidote.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.685
And if this works on Wu,
could it cure Hank?

29:05.744 --> 29:07.314
It should. Yeah, no.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.551
No, it should.
I have all the ingredients.

29:09.614 --> 29:10.922
I just have to mix it.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.359
Well, let's do it.

29:19.023 --> 29:21.128
Hey, look at that. Multiple uses.

29:37.242 --> 29:38.949
How do we get it in Hank?

29:39.010 --> 29:40.216
With a nez-soufflet.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.884
You put these prongs into
the victim's nostrils

29:42.947 --> 29:45.018
and push down on the plunger.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.830
You know, I don't know
Hank all that well.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.601
But how the hell are you
going to convince him

29:52.657 --> 29:53.863
this is something
that's good for him?

29:53.958 --> 29:55.665
Let's just see if it works first.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.308
Hey, Wu, it's Nick.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.453
Nick? That you?

30:10.909 --> 30:12.445
Yeah. Open up the door, man.

30:12.510 --> 30:16.151
Um... I can't right now.
I'm in the middle of dinner.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.122
What are you eating? Fiber.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.935
Oh, my God. My God,
get him on the couch.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.396
I hope we're not too late.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.143
Okay. Hold him down. Hold him down.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.343
God. Here we go again.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.842
Hold his head back.

30:57.722 --> 30:58.962
Was that supposed to happen?

30:59.390 --> 31:00.494
I hope so.

31:01.226 --> 31:02.796
How long is this supposed to last?

31:02.861 --> 31:03.999
I don't know.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.502
Well, how do we know if he's cured?

31:25.583 --> 31:27.221
Where did you guys come from?

31:27.285 --> 31:29.026
Is this a dream?

31:32.557 --> 31:34.036
Why am I in my underwear?

31:36.027 --> 31:37.028
Uh...

31:38.429 --> 31:39.965
This is a little embarrassing.

31:40.598 --> 31:42.407
Excuse me.

31:47.372 --> 31:49.477
I think it worked.

31:49.807 --> 31:51.013
Yeah, and fast.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.645
Time to get it to Hank.

31:57.015 --> 31:58.153
Nick, what's up?

31:58.216 --> 32:00.196
Hank. Hey, where are you, man?

32:00.251 --> 32:01.958
Hey, if it's a body somewhere,
it's got to wait.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.192
I'm at Adalind's.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.791
No. Uh, Hank, listen to me.
I've got to talk to you, okay?

32:05.857 --> 32:07.165
In the morning, man.

32:07.325 --> 32:10.272
I've got big plans tonight.
I'm keeping them. Over and out.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.003
I'm signing off.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.075
Where is he? Adalind's.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.618
Nick?

33:04.148 --> 33:05.855
What if they're, like,
in the middle of...

33:05.917 --> 33:08.397
You know? I mean,
this could get kind of awkward.

33:08.786 --> 33:10.561
And Hank is one thing,
but the Hexenbiest?

33:10.621 --> 33:12.362
You don't want to get
them riled up, man.

33:12.423 --> 33:13.629
It could get ugly fast.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.193
I'm bringing her down.

33:15.259 --> 33:16.932
Look, I'm not saying
I'm against it, but...

33:16.995 --> 33:19.373
You know, that's going to be a pretty
hard thing for a cop to explain.

33:19.430 --> 33:20.704
You know, dead body and all.

33:20.765 --> 33:22.540
What about your partner, dude?

33:22.767 --> 33:25.304
What's he going to think when you gun
down the woman he's in love with?

33:25.370 --> 33:26.849
You have any better ideas?
I'm listening.

33:26.904 --> 33:29.578
Well, if you'd let me think
for a second.. No,l don't.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.988
Hank?

33:42.286 --> 33:43.765
Hank, it's Nick!

33:51.062 --> 33:52.336
Are we too late?

33:53.831 --> 33:55.538
He's still alive.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.941
But why is he unconscious?

34:00.405 --> 34:01.816
Oh, my God.

34:01.906 --> 34:03.647
She altered the zaubertrank.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.545
Hank is still alive, but the...

34:06.611 --> 34:08.318
The antidote, it's useless now.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.585
But it worked on Wu.
He didn't have sex with her.

34:10.648 --> 34:13.788
Oh, God. That always
complicates things, doesn't it?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.420
Hey, come on. Hank. Wake up, man.

34:15.485 --> 34:16.793
Nick. Nick. It's not going to work.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.389
He can't. He...

34:18.456 --> 34:21.402
It's like he's in a coma,
but it's not physical, it's mental.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.905
It's... It's like
his brain is locked.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.702
Well, there's got to
be a way to fix this.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.137
Possibly, if she
used her own blood.

34:28.433 --> 34:29.536
What difference does that make?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.545
The only way you can
break a blood zaubertrank

34:31.601 --> 34:33.741
is by killing the Hexenbiest
whose blood is in it.

34:37.675 --> 34:40.121
Well, I don't have a
problem with that.

34:40.945 --> 34:41.946
Burkhardt

34:42.413 --> 34:43.414
Hello, Nick.

34:43.648 --> 34:44.649
Adalind.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.753
I just wanted to invite you over
to my place for a little dessert.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.087
I'm already there.

34:49.654 --> 34:51.929
Then you found Hank. Good.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.866
Still sleeping peacefully, I hope.

34:54.058 --> 34:55.059
Where are you?

34:55.259 --> 34:57.136
This is the way it's
going to go, Nick.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.337
Hank will be dead by morning

34:59.397 --> 35:02.139
unless I get the key
your aunt gave you.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.710
So, you'd better bring that key to
the Bremen Ruins as soon as you can.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.514
I've got a very busy schedule

35:08.573 --> 35:10.211
and I can't wait all night.

35:10.775 --> 35:15.349
It's really very easy, Nick.
The key or Hank.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.191
She's in Forest Park.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.391
Nick, you can't kill her.
Oh, yeah, I can.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.297
No, it's not like that.
If you shoot her, she'll be dead.

35:25.356 --> 35:26.926
But that won't bring
your partner back.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.132
The only way you can break
the hold she has on Hank

35:30.928 --> 35:32.305
is with the blood of a Grimm.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.038
With your blood.

35:47.011 --> 35:49.116
I hope you brought the key, Nick.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.255
Hank doesn't have much more time.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.453
Sorry.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.392
I would have thought he
meant more to you than that.

35:56.587 --> 35:57.827
He does.

36:00.124 --> 36:02.331
You don't believe me, do you?

36:03.261 --> 36:05.867
Too bad. He's going to die.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.543
How are you going to explain
a dead cop in your bed?

36:09.133 --> 36:12.273
His heart gave out. Happens.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.975
See you at the funeral, Nick.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.043
I'll be sure to cry.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.314
Adalind.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.916
I think it's time we
settle our differences.

36:25.316 --> 36:26.420
Violently.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.103
He's got to be with her by now.

36:44.602 --> 36:45.774
Right?

36:46.671 --> 36:48.878
I should have gone with him.
No, you shouldn't have.

36:49.073 --> 36:50.416
He had to do this alone.

36:52.443 --> 36:54.286
I mean, how do we
know when it's over?

36:54.579 --> 36:56.616
If Hank wakes up, then she's dead.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.252
And if Hank doesn't wake up?

37:02.753 --> 37:04.255
I should have gone with him.

37:48.332 --> 37:49.936
What have you done?

38:42.520 --> 38:44.158
What have you done?

38:53.864 --> 38:55.468
You killed me.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.809
You don't look so dead.

38:58.936 --> 39:01.314
I'm nothing now.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.310
I don't have any powers.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.955
You've taken everything.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.252
I'm just like everybody else.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.592
I have nothing.

39:42.279 --> 39:43.314
Burkhardt

39:43.514 --> 39:44.822
Hey, Nick, you're okay. Right?

39:46.484 --> 39:48.395
Yeah. Hank's okay, too. He woke up.

39:48.452 --> 39:51.490
He seems fine. Um...
But there's a problem. Um...

39:53.691 --> 39:56.035
He's kind of wondering what we're
all doing in Adalind's bedroom.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.367
So, uh...

39:59.497 --> 40:00.771
What do you want me to tell him?

40:09.907 --> 40:11.215
Mom.

40:11.275 --> 40:12.845
What happened?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.725
Oh, my God. He got to you.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.784
How did he get his blood into you?

40:20.184 --> 40:21.219
I bit him.

40:22.787 --> 40:23.993
I didn't mean...

40:24.422 --> 40:27.596
You know what getting that
key would have meant for us.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.604
I wasn't doing it for us.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.599
I was doing it for...

40:34.365 --> 40:35.935
For you.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.114
You lost more than just the key.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.313
The Grimm knew.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.319
How did he know?

40:45.576 --> 40:47.783
Because he's smarter than you.

40:48.579 --> 40:51.355
And he's proven that he's more
valuable than I anticipated.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.827
I underestimated him.

40:54.518 --> 40:57.158
And my mistake was trusting...

40:57.321 --> 40:58.732
An amateur.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.599
I had such high hopes
for you, honey.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.468
What are you going to do to me?

41:08.165 --> 41:09.701
That's not already been done?

41:10.534 --> 41:12.013
You're useless now.

41:13.704 --> 41:15.411
Just another pretty girl.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
