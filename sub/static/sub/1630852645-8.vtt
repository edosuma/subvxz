to deal with it.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.143
<i> You're making too much noise.</i>

19:06.212 --> 19:08.112

19:08.181 --> 19:09.981

19:15.021 --> 19:16.754

19:17.991 --> 19:19.190
<i> - Nope.</i>

19:19.993 --> 19:23.628
- Did you hear that?
- Nothing from the back room.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.163
- Hurley, hand me another cup!

19:26.232 --> 19:27.732
- Uh, we're all out!

19:27.800 --> 19:29.767
- I guess I finally
have a reason to press

19:29.836 --> 19:32.837
the emergency froyo button.
- The what?

19:32.906 --> 19:34.939
- My boss had it installed.

19:37.043 --> 19:40.878
I think we can all agree this
is a froyo emergency, right?

19:40.947 --> 19:42.947
- No, no, I think we're okay!

19:43.016 --> 19:44.348
- Yeah, we don't need
to sound the alarm

19:44.417 --> 19:46.217
and bring other people
into this.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.221
[siren blaring]

19:55.662 --> 19:59.130

I'll get my yogurt later.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.871

20:06.940 --> 20:08.873
and she said
I could go home early,

20:08.942 --> 20:10.541

20:13.846 --> 20:15.913

20:18.851 --> 20:20.484
Why were you guys

into the back room

the yogurt knight.

right after I left Warped.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.389

I mean, yeah, the song,
it's kind of weird,

21:02.962 --> 21:04.862

feel embarrassed

I come into Warped

21:12.739 --> 21:14.305

Seriously, nobody even pays
with cash anymore.
