02:48.336 --> 02:50.542
Time.

02:57.137 --> 02:59.094
You guys suck.

03:00.974 --> 03:03.216
No, really?

03:06.437 --> 03:09.972
You're looking good.
Nothing to worry about. It's fine.

03:10.150 --> 03:13.020
Hot, isn't it?
Shouldn't have gotten in his way, Scottie.

03:13.194 --> 03:16.610
- Looking good out there, babe.
- How would you know, Stiles?

03:16.781 --> 03:21.277
- You want to forfeit the game?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

03:21.452 --> 03:22.651
- No.
- No?

03:22.829 --> 03:26.198
My players have
league scoring records at stake.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.830
If we quit now you can beat the traffic.

03:29.002 --> 03:34.340
- There's a lot to learn from losing.
- We'll play if it's that big a deal to you.

03:41.723 --> 03:43.965
Over here, over here!

03:44.142 --> 03:45.885
Push it up.

03:46.060 --> 03:51.933
- It's not going too well, is it?
- Look at their sneakers.

03:52.108 --> 03:55.643
If our guys had sneakers like that
who knows what they could do.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.694
Shoot.

03:58.865 --> 04:01.617
We're all open.

04:02.744 --> 04:04.986
That fat kid's got a great arm.

04:07.165 --> 04:08.873
Over here. Pass it.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.289
Forget it, dork.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.159
Nice try.

04:51.918 --> 04:53.994
I wanna get out of here.

04:54.671 --> 04:59.582
It's not that bad. First game
of the season, 11 more to go.

04:59.759 --> 05:01.467
It's just a game.

05:01.636 --> 05:04.803
You better shape up.
I can't do this all by myself.

05:04.973 --> 05:08.638
- What is that? Liverwurst?
- What?

05:08.810 --> 05:14.433
- I thought you were on a diet, Chub.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

05:14.607 --> 05:17.359
Chub, look at this.

05:24.242 --> 05:27.445
Give me that.
Stop snooping around in my locker.

05:27.620 --> 05:31.369
Look, I can smell
that liverwurst from over there.

05:31.541 --> 05:34.577
Oh, yeah, right. Underneath these?

05:34.752 --> 05:38.964
All right. Great game, guys.
We showed them.

05:39.132 --> 05:43.130
- We lost, Stiles.
- The umpire needed glasses.

05:43.303 --> 05:46.339
- Remember that seven buck s?
- You owe me.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.014
Without a keg,
they won't let me into the party.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.351
- Where would you buy it anyway?
- Lend me five.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.181
- Later.
- Two.

05:55.356 --> 06:02.569
Hey, Chub, how's the diet?
Lemonade, you were terrific.

06:02.739 --> 06:04.862
What the hell is that?

06:08.870 --> 06:11.990
Lemonade, my man. What it is?

06:12.165 --> 06:16.993
I'm raising some cash
for the Afro-American festival...

06:17.170 --> 06:18.368
Can we talk?

06:28.181 --> 06:31.348
Hey, Scottie, come on in.

06:32.393 --> 06:38.017
- Great game. Want a thigh or a wing?
- That's not necessary, coach.

06:38.191 --> 06:44.692
You said that if we had problems,
we should come to you.

06:44.864 --> 06:51.448
- That's what I'm here for.
- Great, because I got a problem.

06:51.621 --> 06:56.449
What kind of problem?
As you can see, I'm a very busy man.

06:56.626 --> 07:01.751
- It's kind of complicated.
- Oh, those kinds of problems.

07:01.923 --> 07:07.379
What is it? Drugs? Girls?
I'd like to help, but I'm tapped out.

07:07.554 --> 07:12.180
The IRS is breathing down my neck
like it's a personal vendetta.

07:12.350 --> 07:17.178
No, coach. How can I put this?

07:17.355 --> 07:19.597
I'm going through changes.

07:19.774 --> 07:23.475
Don't worry about that.
We all go through that.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.610
Some a bit later than others.

07:25.780 --> 07:29.445
Sorry I didn't notice.
I haven't been in the locker room much.

07:29.617 --> 07:36.949
I don't think it's gonna be possible
for me to play on the team anymore.

07:37.125 --> 07:42.546
Oh, yeah? Well look,
I know what you're going through.

07:42.714 --> 07:46.628
A couple years back
a kid came to me the same way.

07:46.801 --> 07:49.506
Saying to me
the same thing you're saying.

07:49.679 --> 07:51.885
He wanted to drop off the team.

07:52.056 --> 07:56.350
His mother was a widow, all crippled up.
She was scrubbing floors.

07:56.519 --> 08:02.143
She had a pin in her hip.
He wanted to drop basketball and get a job.

08:02.317 --> 08:06.729
Now these were poor people.
Hungry people with real problems.

08:06.905 --> 08:09.146
Understand what I'm saying?

08:11.034 --> 08:13.904
What happened to the kid?

08:14.078 --> 08:17.613
I don't know. He quit.
Third stringer, I didn't need him.

08:19.083 --> 08:23.995
- I'm a first stringer.
- And you work for your old man.

08:24.172 --> 08:28.300
I should be coming to you
when I need money.

08:29.385 --> 08:32.256
Fine. Thank s a lot, coach.

08:32.429 --> 08:36.890
Don't mention it.
Like I said before <i>Mi casa su casa</i>.

08:38.186 --> 08:40.095
Thank s.

08:49.113 --> 08:51.687
Are you going to work?
Will you walk with me?

08:51.866 --> 08:56.160
- Catch you later, Boof.
- Bye, Tina... Sheena..?

08:56.329 --> 08:59.864
I had the strangest dream.
It was bizarre.

09:00.041 --> 09:04.750
- Was I in this one?
- You, Pamela and a bunch of chickens.

09:04.921 --> 09:07.044
- How the hell are you?
- Say no.

09:07.215 --> 09:09.042
- Great talking to you.
- Chickens?

09:09.217 --> 09:12.550
Yeah, big chickens. Giant chickens.
Like fryers.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.635
- That guy was right. We do suck.
- No news there.

09:16.808 --> 09:20.592
71-12. I don't even know
what I'm doing out there.

09:20.770 --> 09:25.728
I'm sick of it, Boof.
I'm sick of being so average.

09:25.900 --> 09:31.440
And it's not just basketball.
It's school, this town, everything.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.821
I like Beacontown.

09:33.992 --> 09:39.234
I'd like my life to change. I don't
wanna end up working for my dad.

09:39.414 --> 09:45.417
- You're father is a terrific guy.
- Boof, look at me.

09:45.587 --> 09:47.912
Now try and be objective.

09:48.089 --> 09:52.418
Am I all right?
Is there anything wrong with me?

09:52.594 --> 09:56.045
- You should shower after basketball.
- I do.

09:56.222 --> 09:58.892
Then there's nothing wrong with you.

09:59.058 --> 10:02.593
Then why won't Pamela Wells
say two words to me?

10:02.770 --> 10:06.519
- You can do a lot better than her.
- Like who?

10:06.691 --> 10:10.641
- Don't you have to be at work?
- Did I say something wrong?

10:10.820 --> 10:13.145
No, no. See you at the party.

10:18.411 --> 10:21.246
- Hey, Angela.
- What was the score?

10:21.414 --> 10:23.454
Very funny.

10:24.500 --> 10:28.201
What was the score?
Don't tell me, I'll lose my count.

10:28.379 --> 10:30.123
Down to our last waffle iron.

10:30.298 --> 10:33.916
How am I expected to compete
with wrenches made in India?

10:34.093 --> 10:36.929
I'm not Sears and Roebuck.

10:37.096 --> 10:41.723
You look a little tired today.
The coach isn't giving you steroids, is he?

10:41.893 --> 10:46.769
Not likely. Maybe he should.
We lost 71-12.

10:46.940 --> 10:51.518
Beacontown hasn't won a game in...
It must be three years.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.023
Ow!

10:53.196 --> 10:57.774
Don't take it personally.
It's all part of growing up.

10:57.951 --> 11:01.154
Yeah, I guess so.

11:01.329 --> 11:05.658
- Any deliveries?
- Down at the high school.

11:05.833 --> 11:10.495
Some strange sounding guy called.
Sounded like he was in a hurry.

11:10.672 --> 11:15.250
I'm not sure what I wrote down.
That's what the clipboard is for.

11:16.469 --> 11:18.462
Well, it is.

11:33.236 --> 11:35.561
It's broken.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.117
A dog whistle?

12:12.233 --> 12:14.689
Hi, Mr. Thorne. How are you, sir?

12:18.156 --> 12:19.401
Thank s.

12:22.577 --> 12:29.078
What an arm.
Thank s, Mr. Thorne. I appreciate it.

12:31.377 --> 12:33.619
I knew he was out there.

12:33.796 --> 12:37.960
I didn't actually hear him,
but I knew he was there.

12:38.134 --> 12:43.377
I could only see a thin white crack
of light which set my bedroom apart...

12:43.556 --> 12:47.720
More sensual. We need to
feel you, want to smell you. Hurt me.

12:47.894 --> 12:50.052
...from the dense and heavy darkness.

12:50.230 --> 12:54.062
But surely I could feel him.
It was Nick.

12:55.735 --> 12:58.273
What was that?

12:58.446 --> 13:00.771
Sorry, sir. That was me.

13:00.949 --> 13:06.323
What do you want from me?
What do people want from me?

13:06.496 --> 13:11.573
- I am merely trying to rehearse.
- I'm sorry.

13:11.751 --> 13:14.586
I've got the stuff that you ordered.

13:14.754 --> 13:19.297
- Are you from the hardware store?
- Yeah.

13:22.762 --> 13:28.005
Pamela? Excuse me.
Are you going to the party tonight?

13:28.184 --> 13:32.478
- I'd like to give you a ride.
- The paint. My paint.

13:32.647 --> 13:35.185
A can of cocoa, a can of mauve.
Am I right?

13:35.358 --> 13:38.110
Right.

13:38.278 --> 13:41.397
- Kirk, how was my reading?
- Beautiful, darling.

13:41.573 --> 13:44.443
Very sensual. I'm still in pain.
Thank you.

13:44.617 --> 13:51.119
You're welcome. Listen, about tonight...
I'm serious. I'd like to take you.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.616
I've got a van.

13:53.793 --> 13:56.913
Hope your acting's better
than your hook shot, boy.

13:57.088 --> 13:58.582
I already have a ride.

13:58.756 --> 14:02.125
Or maybe you were just acting
like a basketball player.

14:02.302 --> 14:04.259
He just delivers hardware, Mick.

14:04.429 --> 14:07.714
Maybe he should get back
to delivering it. Come on.

14:21.529 --> 14:26.275
I said mauve. Not turquoise!

14:26.451 --> 14:28.989
Mr. Lolley?

14:34.375 --> 14:38.325
- The boss says I'm to pick up a keg.
- Is that right?

14:38.504 --> 14:41.209
- The boss called you, right?
- Can't say he did.

14:41.382 --> 14:47.634
Hot damn. The boss is throwing a bash
for one of the boys at the gravel pit.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.964
He just got paroled.

14:55.313 --> 14:59.180
Well, I've got plenty of bread.

15:02.529 --> 15:05.316
Here. There's a little extra for you.

15:09.494 --> 15:13.907
Got to see your ID... sport.

15:34.143 --> 15:39.434
- I don't even like beer.
- Never... say... die.

15:46.698 --> 15:48.525
Dad?

15:50.285 --> 15:53.985
What would you say
if I wanted to quit the team?

15:54.163 --> 15:56.405
- Quit the team?
- Yeah.

15:56.583 --> 16:00.034
That's pretty drastic.
You're not the worst player they've got.

16:00.211 --> 16:04.920
Your mother always said
you could do anything you wanted to.

16:05.091 --> 16:09.255
- I was thinking of doing something else.
- Like what?

16:09.429 --> 16:11.338
School play.

16:11.514 --> 16:14.966
Theatre has its place, I suppose,

16:15.143 --> 16:17.634
but what about
your commitment to the team?

16:17.812 --> 16:24.894
Dad, has anything ever happened to you
that was so weird...

16:25.069 --> 16:29.067
- Maybe we should have a chat.
- How's the king of nuts and bolts?

16:29.240 --> 16:33.108
- Stiles, nice shirt.
- Thank s. Come on, we're late.

16:33.286 --> 16:37.829
- Boof going with you?
- I don't know how she's getting there.

16:37.999 --> 16:40.751
- Is this OK?
- Don't worry, I'll get it.

16:40.919 --> 16:43.125
Have a good time. Be careful.

16:46.966 --> 16:51.260
- Come on.
- Hey, listen. Stiles.

16:51.429 --> 16:54.964
- Is there a rash going around?
- Why, you wanna catch one?

16:55.141 --> 16:58.510
- I'm serious.
- No...

16:58.686 --> 17:02.470
...but I heard Mr. Murphy,
the shop teacher...

17:02.649 --> 17:05.650
...got his dick caught
in a vacuum cleaner.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.277
Forget I asked.

17:17.747 --> 17:22.040
- Stiles, you're crazy.
- No, not crazy. It's perfect.

17:22.210 --> 17:25.329
Now you just stick this in your pocket like this.

17:25.505 --> 17:28.838
You don't say anything except
"Give me a keg, buddy. "

17:29.008 --> 17:32.175
Pay for it so he can't say you robbed him.

17:32.345 --> 17:37.719
You know I'd do this myself,
but that old guy already kicked me out.

17:38.726 --> 17:42.475
Give me the gun.
Give me the money.

17:44.649 --> 17:50.568
- I'm gonna try and buy it. That's it.
- He's a ball buster and it won't work.

17:50.738 --> 17:53.027
- It won't work.
- That's it.

17:53.950 --> 17:55.658
Damn...

18:01.291 --> 18:04.991
Never say...

18:05.170 --> 18:06.712
...die.

18:06.880 --> 18:14.840
No, not that. No, I think I'll leave it.
No, thanks a lot anyway. Bye.

18:15.013 --> 18:21.431
Do you have any more of that liqueur?
My sister really liked that.

18:21.603 --> 18:23.725
Yes, thank you.

18:24.105 --> 18:27.770
Hey, Debbie, are you coming?

18:32.030 --> 18:33.440
Hi.

18:35.158 --> 18:37.779
Hi.

18:37.952 --> 18:43.623
- I'd like a keg of beer, please.
- You don't say.

18:43.791 --> 18:48.204
- Yeah, how much is that?
- Do you have any ID, sonny?

18:49.589 --> 18:52.376
You little bastards
just won't give up, will you?

18:52.550 --> 18:56.500
No ID, no goddamn beer. Can't you
get that through your thick skull?

19:02.227 --> 19:07.434
Give me a keg of beer.

19:15.698 --> 19:17.490
And these.

19:18.284 --> 19:21.487
# Finding my way

19:21.663 --> 19:24.866
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

19:31.047 --> 19:36.634
- What did you say to that guy?
- Just, "Give me a keg. "

19:36.803 --> 19:39.804
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

19:40.890 --> 19:43.808
Well, Lewis. This is it.
Tonight's the night.

19:43.977 --> 19:47.595
- Pamela is gonna be there and so am I.
- So is Mick.

19:47.772 --> 19:50.345
- He won't be there.
- They're going together.

19:50.525 --> 19:54.439
- They're not going together.
- Mick is like 20 years old.

19:54.612 --> 19:59.607
He's still in high school
because he did time in jail.

19:59.784 --> 20:02.026
- Forget Pamela Wells.
- They're not going together.

20:02.203 --> 20:04.112
He's a total psycho.

20:04.289 --> 20:07.124
Why don't you go for Boof?
She likes you.

20:07.292 --> 20:12.666
- You sound like my dad.
- Pull over.

20:12.839 --> 20:14.962
Trust me. We've got to stick together.

20:15.133 --> 20:19.083
I'm not even listening anymore.

20:19.262 --> 20:22.547
- Once and for all they're not going out.
- Yeah, they are.

20:22.724 --> 20:25.096
- Not. You're mistaken.
- You're crazy.

20:25.268 --> 20:28.103
- Lewis, take my wheels.
- I don't have my license yet.

20:28.271 --> 20:29.895
Just do it.

20:30.064 --> 20:33.433
Let's just go to the party.
This isn't a good idea.

20:33.610 --> 20:35.234
Surf's up.

20:36.321 --> 20:38.562
- Drive in front of us.
- Not too close.

20:38.740 --> 20:42.784
- What are you gonna do?
- Will you just do it?

20:44.746 --> 20:46.537
Kids.

20:46.706 --> 20:49.707
- I'm gonna go slow, all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:49.876 --> 20:53.624
Don't worry.
We've got everything under control.

20:53.796 --> 20:59.218
You do your thing and I will do mine.
Cowabunga!

21:59.654 --> 22:00.650
What?

22:02.907 --> 22:03.689
Whoa!

22:05.076 --> 22:06.487
Ahh!

22:06.661 --> 22:08.321
Wow!

22:08.496 --> 22:11.995
- Wipe-out!
- You all right up there?

22:12.166 --> 22:16.211
Yeah, no sweat.
But just watch those waves.

22:31.060 --> 22:35.188
Hello, everybody. I have arrived.

22:35.356 --> 22:39.853
You look great.

22:41.529 --> 22:44.732
Yeah, nice hit, baby.

22:44.907 --> 22:47.908
- You are a cheese ball.
- That's my middle name.

22:48.077 --> 22:51.446
- You'd never catch me up there.
- You'd be the king of urban surfing.

22:51.623 --> 22:55.039
No way, Louie. That's my baby.
Give me that.

23:51.683 --> 23:53.141
Hi.

23:55.478 --> 23:59.772
- Looking for someone in particular?
- Not you.

24:02.110 --> 24:05.775
There you go.
She said two words to you.

24:12.912 --> 24:18.452
Just like I said. No dry throats tonight.
Did I come through or what?

24:18.626 --> 24:23.169
OK, put it down over there.
If we don't get to it, take it home.

24:26.759 --> 24:33.296
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,

24:33.474 --> 24:39.595
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30!

24:41.816 --> 24:44.023
That's it.

24:49.949 --> 24:52.321
You got some kind of rash?

24:57.290 --> 25:00.374
Matchmaker lady, the hat. All right.

25:02.670 --> 25:08.376
Next up is... Whoa, help me Rhonda!

25:12.263 --> 25:17.471
- What do I have to do?
- Read the name on the paper.

25:17.644 --> 25:19.601
It says, "Chubby".

25:26.736 --> 25:29.144
Matchmaker lady.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.699
All right.

25:35.954 --> 25:38.527
All right, Chubby, baby.

25:38.706 --> 25:43.534
You have to eat
this whole bowl of Jell-O.

25:46.047 --> 25:49.048
- What do I have to do?
- Hold the Jell-O.

26:11.990 --> 26:14.481
All right, next up is...

26:18.288 --> 26:19.782
...Boof!

26:26.129 --> 26:28.584
It's... Scott.

26:35.930 --> 26:39.798
- Booferino gets the Howard boy.
- I don't know if this is a good idea.

26:39.976 --> 26:44.804
You're gonna love it.
In fact, it's the grand prize.

26:47.567 --> 26:52.727
Two minutes. Anything goes, baby.
And don't disappoint us.

27:08.963 --> 27:15.417
- It's kinda funny that you got me.
- I lied. I got Malcolm.

27:15.595 --> 27:17.504
Malcolm's a good guy.

27:19.557 --> 27:23.341
You can come a little closer.
I promise I won't bite.

27:26.564 --> 27:29.482
Go, go, go...

27:44.124 --> 27:48.916
Take this cup to Thorne's house,
tell him you're from the Board of Health

27:49.087 --> 27:52.420
and you want to check his... blood sugar.

27:55.843 --> 28:01.679
- Boof, I feel kind of weird.
- How do I feel?

28:24.581 --> 28:27.072
- What is this?
- You gotta see this.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.741
See what? I don't see anything.
Come on.

28:34.465 --> 28:37.336
Aren't you getting a little bit rough?

28:38.511 --> 28:40.136
Hey, your fingernails!

28:45.602 --> 28:47.843
It's awful quiet in there.

28:48.021 --> 28:50.060
Oooh!

28:51.649 --> 28:57.320
Do you guys think they're dead?
There's only one way to find out.

29:07.165 --> 29:10.997
So, tell us.
What's it like coming out of the closet?

29:13.755 --> 29:16.625
It was unexpected.

29:56.089 --> 29:57.500
Scott?

30:06.140 --> 30:08.014
Scott?

31:02.739 --> 31:04.945
Ahh!

31:17.462 --> 31:21.080
Jeez Louise.

31:21.257 --> 31:25.551
- Scott? Can I come in?
- No, Dad.

31:25.720 --> 31:32.138
No, I'm doing something in here. I'll say.

31:32.310 --> 31:37.055
You may be surprised. Whatever it is,
you can tell me. I'll understand.

31:39.692 --> 31:43.227
No, Dad. No, not this time.

31:44.322 --> 31:49.114
Scott Howard, this is your father.
Now open this door right this minute.

31:49.285 --> 31:51.159
OK, Dad.

31:52.789 --> 31:54.865
You asked for it.

32:13.351 --> 32:16.471
An explanation is probably long overdue.

32:16.646 --> 32:23.265
An explanation? Jesus Christ, Dad!
An explanation? Look at me.

32:23.444 --> 32:25.651
- Look at you.
- It's not as bad as it look s.

32:25.822 --> 32:28.111
Wait a minute, Dad.

32:28.282 --> 32:33.324
You mean you knew about this
and you didn't tell me?

32:33.496 --> 32:38.241
I was hoping I wouldn't have to.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

32:38.418 --> 32:42.878
- I was hoping it would pass you by.
- Well, it didn't pass me by.

32:43.047 --> 32:48.172
It landed on my face.
What the hell am I gonna do?

32:54.225 --> 33:00.762
- We really need to talk about this.
- Forget it. I don't wanna talk. Go away.

33:31.846 --> 33:36.638
- Tough night, huh?
- Yeah, you could say that.

33:36.809 --> 33:40.225
And there was a full moon last night.

33:40.396 --> 33:46.316
I meant to talk to you about that last evening,
but you were kind of upset.

33:48.238 --> 33:52.899
Here's a nice hot cup of cocoa.
Look s like you can use it.

33:53.076 --> 33:55.282
That'll help.

33:55.453 --> 34:01.289
Look Scott, being what we are
is not without its problems,

34:01.459 --> 34:04.495
- but it's not all bad either.
- Tell me about it.

34:04.671 --> 34:07.506
You can do things the other guys can't.

34:07.674 --> 34:11.717
Oh, like chase cars and bite the mail man?

34:11.886 --> 34:15.801
When you want it,
you're gonna have great power.

34:15.974 --> 34:19.389
And with great power
goes a greater responsibility.

34:19.561 --> 34:24.056
- Your mom and I learned to live with it.
- And what if can't?

34:24.232 --> 34:28.395
I can look forward to stealing babies
in the middle of the night.

34:28.570 --> 34:31.107
And killing chickens.

34:31.281 --> 34:35.277
Fearing full moons, dodging
silver bullets. Well, no thank s.

34:35.451 --> 34:40.873
Don't believe all that stuff.
With certain obvious exceptions

34:41.040 --> 34:43.413
werewolves are people like anyone else.

34:45.712 --> 34:47.835
What I'm trying to say is

34:48.005 --> 34:52.003
the werewolf is a part of you,
but that doesn't change the inside.

34:52.177 --> 34:56.009
Look, I've got a bad outside hook shot.
I'm allergic to eggs.

34:56.179 --> 34:59.965
I've got a six dollar haircut.
I mean, I have problems.

35:00.143 --> 35:01.934
I don't need this one.

35:04.188 --> 35:06.395
I gotta get to school.

35:11.029 --> 35:12.855
That went well.

35:30.465 --> 35:32.173
- Hello.
- Hi.

35:35.303 --> 35:39.965
- There's something different about you.
- That's nice.

35:40.141 --> 35:42.383
Did you change your hair?

35:43.895 --> 35:46.184
Missed you at lunch today, Scott.

35:46.355 --> 35:50.567
Oh, yeah. Hi, Boof. Sorry, I forgot.

35:50.735 --> 35:57.022
Well, I have to go study my lines.
Kirk... Mr. Lolley... he's so demanding.

35:58.451 --> 36:00.408
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:10.922 --> 36:13.377
How's it going, Stiles?

36:15.093 --> 36:21.890
The twins surely would have died
if they hadn't been saved by a... what?

36:22.058 --> 36:24.549
- A miracle?
- Yes, I suppose.

36:24.727 --> 36:30.516
But what form did this particular
miracle take? Scott Howard?

36:40.535 --> 36:44.070
Very amusing Scott, but you are correct.

36:44.247 --> 36:47.947
The infants were saved
and suckled by a wolf.

36:48.126 --> 36:51.661
A she wolf. Wolf, wolf, wolf.

36:51.838 --> 36:52.917
Wolfe!

36:53.089 --> 36:56.125
Ahh!... tishoo.

36:56.301 --> 36:59.634
Thomas Wolfe. Don't you people
read what I assign you?

36:59.804 --> 37:06.341
"Look Homeward Angel".
Scott, it's a book. By Thomas Wolfe.

37:06.519 --> 37:10.599
- Wolfe. Wolfe.
- Scott.

37:13.067 --> 37:17.564
Come on, Scott.
It's a lot simpler than it look s.

37:20.825 --> 37:23.067
OK.

37:37.008 --> 37:39.380
Just try, Scott.

38:09.707 --> 38:11.866
It's wet. You can't go in.

38:13.336 --> 38:15.375
That's wet, too!

38:46.202 --> 38:52.656
Don't change, don't change.
Stay calm, stay calm.

38:59.382 --> 39:02.751
- Little far from you side, aren't you?
- No.

39:02.927 --> 39:06.759
I mean, yes, sir, but the halls were wet.

39:06.931 --> 39:09.090
- Let me see your hands.
- Sir.

39:09.267 --> 39:12.470
Let me see your hands now.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.066
You don't have a marker on you,
do you?

39:28.369 --> 39:31.536
No. No, sir.

39:31.706 --> 39:35.157
I've got my eyes on you
and if you ever get out of line...

39:37.670 --> 39:40.707
Yeah, I gotta go.

39:59.609 --> 40:05.647
- What are you doing?
- Big brother keeps an emergency stash.

40:05.823 --> 40:11.244
I got to talk to you about something,
because it's making me nuts.

40:11.413 --> 40:15.541
If it's that intense,
I'll need a solid buzz to think clearly.

40:17.001 --> 40:23.799
Look, I wouldn't even mention it to you,
but I got to talk to someone.

40:23.967 --> 40:29.969
If you're gonna tell me you're a fag,
I don't think I can handle it.

40:30.139 --> 40:32.809
I'm not a fag.

40:32.976 --> 40:35.098
I'm... a werewolf.

40:37.772 --> 40:40.643
Where would that scumbag keep it?

40:50.994 --> 40:52.536
Scott.

40:55.915 --> 40:59.000
- Scottie?
- Stiles, it's me.

41:09.345 --> 41:11.005
What do you think?

41:12.307 --> 41:18.475
Can you do that any time you want?

41:18.646 --> 41:21.184
I guess so. I mean, I just did.

41:21.357 --> 41:25.058
But sometimes it happens
when I don't want it to.

41:27.322 --> 41:29.279
What can I say?

41:32.160 --> 41:34.864
You're beautiful.

41:37.040 --> 41:43.458
Hey, what can a teen wolf do?

41:43.630 --> 41:48.920
- I can smell what you're looking for.
- The stash?

41:51.554 --> 41:53.511
Oh no, I checked there.

42:03.650 --> 42:07.943
Stiles, this is just between you and me, OK?

42:08.112 --> 42:10.105
Yeah, yeah. TW.

42:13.952 --> 42:15.529
Look at you.

42:15.703 --> 42:19.867
You're gonna be glad you came to me,
because with the right angles

42:20.041 --> 42:24.335
we're gonna turn this into something...
monstrous.

42:24.504 --> 42:27.873
Stiles. Stiles.

42:28.675 --> 42:31.960
Go ahead. Shoot it, shoot it.

42:32.053 --> 42:37.474
No way, no way.
Don't foul me now. Here we go.

42:40.729 --> 42:42.139
Yeah!

42:46.192 --> 42:49.193
- Hi, Scott.
- Hi.

42:49.362 --> 42:53.526
Boof came over for a little one on one.
She's killing me.

42:54.659 --> 42:57.150
What? What's so funny?

42:57.328 --> 43:03.248
- We were just chatting. Do you mind?
- No, why should I mind?

43:03.418 --> 43:08.080
Well, I gotta get going.
Would you like to walk me home?

43:08.673 --> 43:13.549
- Boof, I just got here.
- Scott.

43:13.720 --> 43:17.385
- Yeah.
- Thank s for everything.

43:17.557 --> 43:20.724
- You better work on that jumpshot.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:24.022 --> 43:27.521
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

43:32.822 --> 43:34.233
Ha!

43:35.074 --> 43:36.818
Get in!

43:40.079 --> 43:45.619
So, you guys were chatting.
Harold Howard and his famous chats.

43:45.793 --> 43:47.204
What did he say?

43:47.378 --> 43:51.246
He mentioned you were thinking
of quitting basketball

43:51.424 --> 43:54.627
- to work on a school play.
- Yeah.

43:54.802 --> 43:58.883
I can see why. She's very pretty, Scott.

43:59.057 --> 44:04.513
But she has a boyfriend.
A very large boyfriend.

44:04.687 --> 44:09.396
The way things are going now
I should just stay away from everyone.

44:09.567 --> 44:11.939
Even me?

44:13.238 --> 44:15.526
I couldn't get rid of you if I tried.

44:17.283 --> 44:19.856
- What?
- Do you remember?

44:20.036 --> 44:22.278
- How old were we? Six?
- Five.

44:22.455 --> 44:25.906
I wanted to run away,
but you wouldn't let me go alone.

44:26.084 --> 44:29.583
- I thought you'd get lost.
- We just walked around the block

44:29.754 --> 44:32.541
because our parents
wouldn't let us cross the street.

44:32.715 --> 44:37.840
- I thought they were gonna kill us.
- But nobody even knew we were gone.

44:38.012 --> 44:41.381
Did you ever tell anybody?
Me neither.

44:47.563 --> 44:51.857
Scott, if you ever
need someone to talk to,

44:52.026 --> 44:55.941
if something is bothering you,
I'll understand.

44:59.450 --> 45:03.697
Not this time, Boof.
You won't understand.

45:05.165 --> 45:08.165
- I've gotta go.
- Yeah, bye.

45:30.314 --> 45:33.150
OK, now here's the drill.
Play 'em man for man.

45:33.318 --> 45:36.900
- You know who you've got.
- Hey baby, ten hut. Nice haircut.

45:37.071 --> 45:42.446
"Be all that you can be. " What is this?
Is the president here or something?

45:43.787 --> 45:47.736
- Good luck, Scott.
- Thank s. Thank you.

45:55.173 --> 45:58.127
It'll all be over in less than an hour.

45:58.301 --> 46:00.590
Any strategy against Meechum, coach?

46:00.762 --> 46:04.047
You guys are great.
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

46:04.223 --> 46:07.260
Go out there and give 'em hell.

46:14.317 --> 46:17.069
That's a foul. Let's go.

46:18.655 --> 46:20.813
Come on, set it up.

46:20.990 --> 46:23.825
Up to the line, Scottie. You can do it.

46:34.921 --> 46:36.380
Ahh!

46:36.547 --> 46:41.256
Go and get me some salt. Salt.

46:43.054 --> 46:45.047
Flick the ball back to him.

46:45.223 --> 46:48.307
Go, Scottie.

46:49.894 --> 46:52.931
Easy, easy.

47:09.956 --> 47:11.581
Come on. Let's go.

48:43.133 --> 48:45.505
Come on.

48:57.772 --> 49:02.481
- All right, guys.
- Let's play a little ball here.

50:26.277 --> 50:30.405
- Hey Scott, did the coach know?
- Hey, I didn't know.

50:31.991 --> 50:35.989
- How do you feel?
- He feels... like a winner!

50:43.419 --> 50:46.586
- Boof, did you know?
- Are you kidding?

50:49.300 --> 50:51.542
On the house, sonny.

51:51.112 --> 51:53.817
Hey, Lewis.

51:57.994 --> 52:01.280
- Whoa, Mr. T.
- You may think you're special,

52:01.456 --> 52:04.872
but let me remind you
that I'm still the vice-principal.

52:05.043 --> 52:08.661
Hey, I'm no different than anyone else.

52:10.131 --> 52:13.334
That's nice. You look good in that.

54:05.205 --> 54:08.324
- Well, Scott Howard.
- Hey, Boof.

54:08.499 --> 54:10.658
Aren't you afraid you'll
disappoint your fans?

54:10.835 --> 54:13.670
I can't help
that the town is wolf crazy.

54:13.838 --> 54:16.459
This wasn't my idea.

54:16.633 --> 54:18.921
- There are some advantages.
- None.

54:19.093 --> 54:22.427
All sizes. No waiting, everybody.
Check it out. Right here.

54:22.597 --> 54:25.847
Hey Scotto, tip of the iceberg, baby.
We are cleaning up.

54:26.017 --> 54:28.472
Boof, I've got something for you.

54:28.645 --> 54:31.811
Here we go. Check it out.
All sizes. No waiting.

54:31.981 --> 54:34.935
- Elegant.
- Scott.

54:35.109 --> 54:39.688
Listen to this.
Kirk wants you to be in the play.

54:39.864 --> 54:42.818
He does? Wait a minute.
What about basketball?

54:42.992 --> 54:47.453
It won't interfere.
It's a small part. Just for you.

54:47.622 --> 54:51.869
Here, Pamela. This is for you.
It's too big for me.

54:52.043 --> 54:55.127
There are some advantages, Scott.
Admit it.

55:02.553 --> 55:07.381
You can murder my family.
You can ravish my body.

55:07.559 --> 55:12.055
But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy,

55:12.230 --> 55:15.147
don't destroy my plantation.

55:20.029 --> 55:23.279
Sergeant, burn the fields.

55:23.449 --> 55:27.114
And when you're done with that,
burn the house.

55:28.538 --> 55:29.700
Yeah...

55:29.872 --> 55:33.573
Wolf... wolf... wolf person.
Whatever your name is.

55:33.751 --> 55:36.955
- That was really...
- Thank s, babe, I love you.

55:37.130 --> 55:37.995
...something.

55:41.509 --> 55:43.418
Come in.

55:45.430 --> 55:48.466
- Hi.
- Close the door, please.

55:48.641 --> 55:50.433
Yeah.

55:58.693 --> 56:03.106
Relax. We're just
one big happy family in the theatre.

56:05.408 --> 56:07.116
Yeah.

56:10.747 --> 56:13.072
What happened to the wolf?

56:13.249 --> 56:18.077
Can you just change back and forth
whenever you feel like it?

56:18.254 --> 56:24.506
Sure. Sometimes I have to get
kind of worked up to be the wolf,

56:24.677 --> 56:27.465
but it's not too hard.

56:27.639 --> 56:31.008
What do you think about
to get worked up?

56:31.184 --> 56:35.098
Different things.

56:39.942 --> 56:42.944
Wolves aren't supposed to be shy.

56:46.282 --> 56:50.197
Pamela, what are you doing?

56:52.414 --> 56:55.664
You are an animal.

57:16.562 --> 57:18.935
Strike.

57:19.107 --> 57:21.514
Five in a row.

57:33.288 --> 57:35.114
OK...

57:36.499 --> 57:39.168
Did you know he was gonna be here?

57:41.254 --> 57:45.667
We had such a nice day today.
Don't spoil it.

57:50.305 --> 57:52.593
OK, you got it.

57:52.765 --> 57:57.143
Nice. Good. OK.
Good form. Nice approach.

58:02.900 --> 58:07.029
- Oh, poo.
- Boy, that was nice and warm.

58:09.324 --> 58:14.282
OK, address the ball.

58:14.454 --> 58:20.326
Tuck in your tummy.
That's good. OK.

58:20.501 --> 58:22.660
Here we go. Are you ready?

58:22.837 --> 58:26.621
Hey, that's my girl.
Don't touch her again.

58:26.800 --> 58:31.461
- She's my date tonight, pal.
- You don't scare me, freak.

58:32.889 --> 58:35.724
Underneath all that hair
you're still a dork, Scott.

58:36.893 --> 58:41.354
I've handled your kind before.
Your mom used to steal chickens.

58:41.522 --> 58:44.772
Till I blew her head off with a shotgun.
Right, Scott?

58:59.916 --> 59:04.412
So, does Mick always act like that?

59:04.587 --> 59:07.707
You can hardly blame him.
He is my boyfriend.

59:07.882 --> 59:11.714
- You mean was your boyfriend.
- Is my boyfriend.

59:11.886 --> 59:17.047
- But what about us?
- What about us?

59:17.225 --> 59:23.939
- This afternoon in your dressing room.
- Yeah?

59:24.107 --> 59:28.021
Yeah... Well, you see
the spring dance is coming up...

59:28.194 --> 59:32.441
And I already told you
I'm going to the dance with Mick.

01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:18.616
- Hey, Chubaroo, nice game, guy.
- Yeah.

01:00:21.039 --> 01:00:25.202
- At least we're winning.
- He is. When do we get the ball?

01:00:25.376 --> 01:00:28.543
What good is the championship
if we don't get to play?

01:00:28.713 --> 01:00:31.833
It's not how you play,
it's whether you win or lose.

01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:36.088
- And even that's not important.
- How about a celebration?

01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:40.212
- Chubby, ice cream sundae?
- I'm on a diet, remember?

01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:43.100
Brad, glass of milk?

01:00:45.063 --> 01:00:47.636
I don't get it. What's their problem?

01:00:47.815 --> 01:00:51.185
Let me give you some advice.
I have three rules

01:00:51.361 --> 01:00:56.486
Get 12 hours of sleep, don't play cards
with a guy whose name is also a city

01:00:56.658 --> 01:01:00.109
and avoid ladies with dagger tattoos.

01:01:00.286 --> 01:01:04.070
Stick with that
and everything else is cream cheese.

01:01:04.249 --> 01:01:06.574
Great game there, Scottie.

01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:10.752
Thank s, coach.

01:01:17.762 --> 01:01:19.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:22.675
Stiles?

01:01:24.102 --> 01:01:29.344
- Where did you get this?
- We traded in the Nova. Even swap.

01:01:29.524 --> 01:01:34.233
- How much extra did you pay for this?
- Even swap.

01:01:34.404 --> 01:01:40.276
For certain considerations.
Lookey here!

01:01:40.451 --> 01:01:43.203
- Stiles.
- Hey, surf's up?

01:01:43.371 --> 01:01:48.080
Yeah, surf is definitely up.
Let's go pick up Lewis, OK?

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:54.336
What? What is it with Lewis?
He's avoiding me, right?

01:01:54.507 --> 01:01:56.547
He's scared of me.

01:01:58.302 --> 01:02:05.385
We've got fine wheels, good tunes
and a total disregard for public safety.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.849
You're right. OK, let's go. Surf's up.

01:02:08.021 --> 01:02:09.812
Wait a minute.

01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:12.270
These waves are mine.

01:03:00.239 --> 01:03:02.363
Unbelievable!

01:03:09.457 --> 01:03:12.873
You know what?
You look great up there!

01:03:29.394 --> 01:03:32.145
Missed you at the hardware store.

01:03:32.313 --> 01:03:39.194
- Sorry. I was with Stiles this afternoon.
- I know.

01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:43.901
- You saw?
- Yeah, I saw.

01:03:44.075 --> 01:03:49.911
Unless that was another werewolf
doing a handstand on Stiles' wolfmobile.

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:54.622
Look, Dad.

01:03:54.794 --> 01:03:57.961
I'm trying to get a grip on this. I really am.

01:03:59.507 --> 01:04:03.291
- Is Thorne still on your back?
- Yeah, Thorne...

01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:07.004
...some Neanderthal named Mick
and the entire basketball team.

01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:10.348
You've dug your own hole
with those fellows, but...

01:04:10.518 --> 01:04:12.641
...this Thorne business is my fault.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.897
What do you mean your fault?

01:04:17.066 --> 01:04:19.023
It goes back a few years.

01:04:19.194 --> 01:04:23.061
As you know, I loved your mother
since we were kids.

01:04:23.239 --> 01:04:25.564
We were meant for each other.

01:04:25.742 --> 01:04:29.193
But for some reason Rusty
Thorne set his cap for her too.

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:32.537
No matter what we tried,
he wouldn't go away.

01:04:32.707 --> 01:04:37.950
- One night, things got physical and...
- And you turned into the werewolf.

01:04:38.129 --> 01:04:43.124
Out of anger, Scott.
I turned into the werewolf out of anger.

01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:46.966
- In front of his beady, little eyes.
- Was he scared?

01:04:47.138 --> 01:04:49.711
Scared?

01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:55.134
- He lost control of his bodily functions.
- I wish I could have seen that.

01:04:55.313 --> 01:04:59.642
It wasn't a very nice thing to do.
But it worked.

01:04:59.817 --> 01:05:02.522
After that he never
bothered your mother or me.

01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:08.816
But to this day, I don't know
who was the most frightened that night.

01:05:08.993 --> 01:05:12.409
Old Rusty Thorne... or me.

01:05:13.539 --> 01:05:16.209
You gotta get a hold of it, son.

01:05:33.017 --> 01:05:35.591
- Morning, Daisy.
- Morning.

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:42.058
- Boof. What's up?
- Nothing.

01:05:43.695 --> 01:05:48.273
Why does anything have to be up?
I thought I'd walk to school with you.

01:05:55.832 --> 01:06:02.202
- Got any plans for the spring dance?
- Hadn't given it much thought.

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.876
I'm surprised they haven't decided
to call it "Teen Wolf Ball".

01:06:09.595 --> 01:06:15.550
- Will you... go with me to the dance?
- I'll think about it.

01:06:15.727 --> 01:06:21.183
- Is that a yes?
- Yes. On one condition.

01:06:21.357 --> 01:06:24.726
- You take me to the dance.
- I thought we just established...

01:06:24.902 --> 01:06:29.232
You, Scott Howard. Not the wolf.

01:06:30.617 --> 01:06:36.406
No. Look, I've got to be the wolf.
That's what everyone expects.

01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:39.665
- Is that what you want?
- Everybody likes the wolf.

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:43.120
All right, almost everybody.

01:06:43.296 --> 01:06:48.587
You said it yourself. If I go as
Scott Howard, I'm gonna be average.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.879
Why do I have to be like everybody else?

01:06:52.055 --> 01:06:54.724
That's not a problem for you anymore.

01:06:54.891 --> 01:06:58.260
And I guess
I don't have a date for the dance.

01:06:58.436 --> 01:07:03.727
Look, Boof, I'm sorry. I can't.

01:07:06.402 --> 01:07:10.946
Hey, listen.
You'll still dance with me, won't you?

01:07:11.783 --> 01:07:13.941
Even if I'm a werewolf?

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:19.237
Yeah, I'll still dance with you.

01:07:19.415 --> 01:07:21.871
- And feed me grapes?
- Don't push it.

01:07:22.043 --> 01:07:23.323
Tickle my paws?

01:07:53.825 --> 01:07:57.739
She's right. You are an animal.

01:08:27.942 --> 01:08:30.314
There he is!

01:08:32.947 --> 01:08:35.901
Oh, my God!

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.444
You look fabulous.
Absolutely gorgeous!

01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:48.959
Nice to see you.
Thank you, thank you... How are you doing?

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:52.416
- Hey, save me a dance?
- You'll have to ask my escort.

01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:55.046
Stay away from her tonight.
I'm warning you.

01:08:55.261 --> 01:08:57.669
Hey, Stiles.

01:08:57.846 --> 01:09:01.796
Thank you. Thank s.

01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:05.060
Hi, how are you doing?

01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:08.064
Wolf, Wolf, Wolf...

01:09:08.232 --> 01:09:11.103
You still wanna dance with the wolf?

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.528
- Your public wants you.
- Do you mind?

01:10:56.299 --> 01:10:58.754
- What?
- What am I gonna do about you?

01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:02.378
Hey, Boof, I am what I am.

01:11:05.266 --> 01:11:08.884
All I said was
I might wanna dance with him.

01:11:09.062 --> 01:11:14.222
You can't possibly take it seriously.
Not unless you want to have his puppies.

01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:26.237
I want Scott for just a half hour.
I really missed him.

01:12:09.122 --> 01:12:13.665
Stay away from Pamela. She's mine.
Stick with your own kind, freak.

01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:16.456
Like that little tramp.

01:12:17.839 --> 01:12:18.918
Mick, watch out!

01:12:26.806 --> 01:12:28.763
What are you all laughing at?

01:12:28.933 --> 01:12:33.180
- Get back here.
- You're just some kind of animal.

01:12:33.354 --> 01:12:39.108
Come on, freak. Get back here.
Let go of me. Let go.

01:12:39.277 --> 01:12:44.022
Get back. I'll rip your head right off.
Come on, freak.

01:12:44.198 --> 01:12:47.532
I'm not through with you yet.
Come back, freak.

01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:52.578
This isn't done by a long shot.
Get back in here, freak.

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:57.710
Come back here, freak.
We haven't settled this yet!

01:13:07.389 --> 01:13:08.966
Hold it.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.521
Now you've done it.

01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:25.235
You don't know how long I have waited
to get you right where I have you.

01:13:26.866 --> 01:13:32.821
You're never going to play
basketball again. You know why?

01:13:32.998 --> 01:13:36.580
Because you're not going
to be here anymore, that's why.

01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:39.502
You're out of here, Mr. Howard.
And don't you...

01:13:39.671 --> 01:13:44.712
Thorne. Go on home, son. Go ahead.

01:13:44.884 --> 01:13:47.042
I'll handle this.

01:13:56.854 --> 01:14:01.896
- You never learn, do you, Rusty?
- You stay away from me.

01:14:02.068 --> 01:14:06.895
I want you to leave my son alone.

01:14:07.073 --> 01:14:13.408
He's a good kid. He's just having
a tough time right now. OK?

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.218
I knew I could count on you, Rusty.

01:14:34.476 --> 01:14:38.604
You can murder my family.
You can ravish my body.

01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:42.935
But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy,

01:14:43.109 --> 01:14:46.608
don't destroy my plantation.

01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:53.984
- Sergeant, burn the fields...
- Hold it. Hold it, baby.

01:14:54.162 --> 01:14:57.613
...down the house.
- Hold it right there, babe.

01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:00.329
Listen...

01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:04.998
...this is a full dress rehearsal.
We need to see the wolf.

01:15:05.173 --> 01:15:09.253
So wolf out, wolf up, wolf it.
Whatever you do. <i>Pronto amigo</i>

01:15:09.427 --> 01:15:15.263
Mr. Lolley. I've been doing
some thinking and I decided

01:15:15.433 --> 01:15:17.556
I'd rather play the part as me.

01:15:17.727 --> 01:15:23.267
- Well, play it. Play it as myself.
- That wouldn't be theatre, would it?

01:15:23.441 --> 01:15:26.976
See, no one wants to see you.

01:15:28.404 --> 01:15:32.532
Well, like I said, I'd rather play it like this.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:38.039
OK, I see. How am I gonna put this to you?

01:15:38.206 --> 01:15:42.203
Look at it this way no wolf...

01:15:42.376 --> 01:15:44.915
...no part. What do you think?

01:15:56.224 --> 01:15:58.549
Wow. Bummer, huh?

01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:03.056
Hey, Scottie.

01:16:04.148 --> 01:16:09.605
- I'll have Friday nights free.
- Even if you won't be the wolf,

01:16:09.779 --> 01:16:12.946
- do you have to quit the team?
- Are you kidding?

01:16:13.115 --> 01:16:18.988
You've seen me play basketball. I suck.
They want the wolf. I can't do it.

01:16:19.164 --> 01:16:24.538
Wait a minute. What's going on?
What are you guys talking about?

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:30.132
We're talking about the wolf, Stiles. I can't
do it anymore. You saw what happened.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.126
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe.

01:16:32.302 --> 01:16:35.919
The championship is coming up
in less than four hours.

01:16:36.097 --> 01:16:40.261
Everyone's depending on you.
Are you gonna let down your team?

01:16:40.435 --> 01:16:42.641
Your school? This whole town?

01:16:42.812 --> 01:16:47.225
What about me?
I've got a large investment going on over here.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.025
Hey, Scott, do it for me.

01:16:51.654 --> 01:16:53.528
I gotta go, man.

01:16:53.698 --> 01:16:57.992
Scott, help me out. Do the right thing.

01:16:59.746 --> 01:17:04.040
That's all I wanna do, Stiles.
That's all I wanna do.

01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:35.985
Boo!

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:46.113
Chubby, get time. Come here.

01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:48.250
See that?

01:17:49.796 --> 01:17:51.587
Come on.

01:17:56.886 --> 01:17:59.258
That's a purple heart, kid.

01:18:03.142 --> 01:18:06.677
Smart basketball, Brad,
taking a charge like that.

01:18:20.243 --> 01:18:21.986
Oh, man.

01:18:50.231 --> 01:18:55.736
- So where's the wolf?
- Not today, coach. No wolf.

01:18:55.903 --> 01:18:58.940
Wait until the second half.
Build up their confidence.

01:18:59.115 --> 01:19:04.655
Look, coach, no wolf.
Not now, not ever.

01:19:04.829 --> 01:19:09.290
I wanna play, but I gotta be myself.

01:19:09.458 --> 01:19:13.622
OK, but we're gonna get
our brains beat in, you know.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:22.262
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- I've had it.

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:26.510
- This is all your fault, Howard.
- I think we can take these guys.

01:19:26.684 --> 01:19:33.186
- Terrific, now where's the wolf?
- No, I mean it. I think we can win.

01:19:33.357 --> 01:19:39.063
This is the championship. It doesn't
matter how we got here. We're here.

01:19:39.238 --> 01:19:43.699
If we're gonna win, we gotta do it
ourselves. We don't need the wolf.

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:52.241
Harold, your boy let us down.

01:19:55.379 --> 01:19:56.922
You're dead.

01:20:05.681 --> 01:20:08.303
Shoot. Shoot it.

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:14.227
Shoot it!

01:20:14.399 --> 01:20:16.106
Shoot it, fat boy.

01:20:20.655 --> 01:20:21.936
Yeah!

01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:42.331
- How much more can you take, freak?
- As much as you can dish out.

01:23:42.648 --> 01:23:45.020
What's so funny, dork?

01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:50.274
That's four fouls.
One more and you're out of there.

01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:25.411
Come on. Make your move.

01:25:40.183 --> 01:25:42.638
Come on, fat boy. Try it.

01:26:10.588 --> 01:26:13.162
You gotta get back. Get back.

01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:16.461
You got two shots.
Get back. Off the court.

01:28:40.947 --> 01:28:44.565
- Let's blow out of here.
- Drop dead.
