[music playing]

00:03.837 --> 00:06.207
[harmonica music]

00:10.278 --> 00:11.945
Ick, "General Hospital?"

00:11.979 --> 00:13.747
Why are you wasting your
time watching this trash?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.049
"Guiding Light" is on.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.951
Because I'm a little
concerned about what

00:17.985 --> 00:20.121
they're doing with
Jason's character.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.989
Halfway through the show, and
he still has his shirt on.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.124
[laughter]

00:23.157 --> 00:25.059
Oh, well, he's going
down to the waterfront.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.827
Brenda's gonna be
down there crying.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.828
It's coming off.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.630
[laughter]

00:29.663 --> 00:30.564
Excuse me.

00:30.598 --> 00:34.102
Could I get some sugar?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.036
[laughter]

00:37.138 --> 00:38.806
Roseanne!

00:38.839 --> 00:40.941
Should I just rip off the
shirt of every customer

00:40.974 --> 00:42.776
so that they can
get your attention?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.078
Not these customers.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.480
No, no, no, no, no, no no, no.

00:46.514 --> 00:50.918
We don't charge Mr. Mehlman of
Mehlman Restaurant Supplies.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.754
He's our special friend.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.190
Oh, a special friend, huh?

00:56.224 --> 00:57.458
[laughter]

00:57.491 --> 00:59.827
Well, the food is on the house.

00:59.860 --> 01:00.961
If you're sleeping
with Leon, it's

01:00.994 --> 01:02.696
a miracle you can eat at all.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.031
[laughter]

01:05.032 --> 01:07.901
She, uh, thinks she's funny.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.604
You know, I'd let the girl go,
except she scares away robbers.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.839
[laughter]

01:11.872 --> 01:13.874
You know, I got a gal
like that who works for me.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.443
Gives me nothing but trouble.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.211
I'd fire her, but she's my wife!

01:17.245 --> 01:18.912
[laughter]

01:20.781 --> 01:21.682
Oh, my.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.251
Give Maureen my love.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.119
Well, I gotta get
back to the office.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.988
Find out of my employees
are working hard,

01:28.021 --> 01:29.056
or hardly working.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.024
[laughter]

01:31.058 --> 01:32.760
You know, I hear
he's considered

01:32.793 --> 01:34.495
a comic genius in France.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.996
[laughter]

01:37.365 --> 01:39.767
Roseanne, let me give you
a little business lesson.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.236
That gentleman you
were just so rude to

01:42.270 --> 01:47.074
is Mr. Stu Mehlman, whom I
met at the Lanford Men's Club.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.476
I invited him here.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.077
I made friends with him.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.448
And now we are getting a
deep fat fryer for cost.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.217
Well, that is
great, because I'd

01:56.250 --> 01:58.118
hate to hold your face
in a deep fat fryer

01:58.152 --> 01:59.487
we paid full price for.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.854
[laughter]

02:00.888 --> 02:04.392
It's called
networking, Roseanne.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.227
And that is why I
have been after Jackie

02:06.260 --> 02:09.263
to join the Lanford
Women's Association.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.365
So we can get more
things at a discount.

02:11.399 --> 02:16.036
In fact, Nancy,
why don't you join?

02:16.069 --> 02:19.039
You've been asking for more
responsibility around here.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.574
I just meant I wanted a key.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.443
[laughter]

02:25.446 --> 02:27.348
So, wait, hold on a second.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.582
And what about me, you know?

02:28.616 --> 02:31.084
I can join some group
of stupid, snobby,

02:31.118 --> 02:33.387
stuck up broads
and make friends.

02:33.421 --> 02:37.358
Ha, oh, Roseanne, how
can I say this so that I

02:37.391 --> 02:41.094
don't hurt your feelings?

02:41.128 --> 02:43.497
You're a horrible woman
and nobody likes you.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.399
[laughter]

02:46.967 --> 02:50.438
Well, be that as it
may, I'm still gonna join.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.606
And I'll get us a lot
of free stuff, too.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.707
No, face it, Roseanne.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.310
You just don't have the
skills that it takes

02:56.344 --> 02:57.945
to represent this business.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.982
Oh, now, Leon, I may not have
your vast wealth of business

03:02.015 --> 03:05.486
experience, nor your great
willingness to kiss butt,

03:05.519 --> 03:06.954
but I do have something else

03:06.987 --> 03:07.855
Really?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.357
And what might that be?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.258
Your nipple.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.158
Ow!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.226
[laughter]

03:12.260 --> 03:14.662
[theme music]

03:57.104 --> 03:58.572
[laughing]

03:59.573 --> 04:01.975
[music playing]

04:07.548 --> 04:10.284
OK, so, well, what do you
think of these earrings?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.620
Oh, yeah, that's much better.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.588
These are the exact
same ones I had on before.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.357
See, you're not paying
any attention at all.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.426
I am too.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.061
Holy cow, what are
you so dressed up for?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.531
Because I have to go
impress these business women

04:23.564 --> 04:25.666
so I can use them for contacts.

04:25.699 --> 04:29.370
Then later I can go back to
chewing tobacky and rolling up

04:29.403 --> 04:30.404
my hair in soup cans.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.839
[laughter]

04:32.873 --> 04:34.274
Hey.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.377
So did you make
many tips tonight?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.412
Or won't you know until you
shake out your underpants?

04:38.446 --> 04:40.147
[laughter]

04:42.383 --> 04:43.250
Hey, sweetheart.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.284
Hey, honey.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.719
I have to go,
I'm late for class.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.488
What time did you
get in last night?

04:47.521 --> 04:48.489
Mm, I don't know.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.023
It was either 10:00 or 11:00.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.426
We really should buy a
digital clock for the boy.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.827
[laughter]

04:54.795 --> 04:55.596
Have a nice night.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.969
So, how you doing?

05:02.002 --> 05:02.936
Well, it sucks, mom.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.372
I mean, I know he's
doing it for us,

05:04.405 --> 05:05.673
but he's at school all night.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.074
And I work all day.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.209
We don't ever get
to talk anymore.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.478
Well, that's a
shame, because you're

05:10.511 --> 05:11.845
really missing something.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.782
I mean, when you're not around,
the witty, insightful things

05:14.815 --> 05:16.384
that come out of
that boy's mouth,

05:16.417 --> 05:17.585
you just wouldn't believe.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.553
Well, it's like the only
time we spend together

05:19.587 --> 05:21.321
is when he wakes me
up when he gets home.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.790
Well, at least he's
still polite enough

05:22.823 --> 05:23.724
to wake you up first.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.593
[laughter]

05:27.160 --> 05:29.463
[music playing]

05:37.270 --> 05:39.907
Oh, all these stuck-up
broads in business suits.

05:39.940 --> 05:40.874
I should have worn underwear.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.109
[laughter]

05:42.142 --> 05:45.446
There's a men's group
meeting across the hall.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.480
All right.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.582
It's just a hassle
using birth control.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.584
[laughter]

05:50.618 --> 05:54.154
We brought her, and I have
to tell everybody I'm married?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.989
[laughter]

05:57.057 --> 05:57.991
Hello.

05:58.025 --> 05:58.892
Hello.

05:58.926 --> 05:59.860
[applause]

06:00.861 --> 06:03.797
Oh, Roseanne Conner.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.033
You wouldn't be DJ's
mother, would you?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.535
Well, that depends.
What'd he do?

06:07.568 --> 06:08.769
[laughter]

06:08.802 --> 06:11.138
You know, I think our
sons are in the same class.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.272
Oh!

06:12.305 --> 06:14.575
Oh, well, of course they are.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.210
Yeah, DJ talks about
him all the time.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.013
Just this morning he was
saying, uh, we don't see enough

06:20.047 --> 06:22.583
of that, uh, Anderson kid.
[laughter]

06:22.616 --> 06:23.517
Elijah.

06:23.551 --> 06:27.421
Elijah, that's
such a great name.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.122
I've never seen you
at our meetings before.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.223
Do you work here in town?

06:30.257 --> 06:31.391
Um, yeah.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.194
I'm the proprietor
of the lunchbox.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.964
Oh, you mean
Lean Carp's place?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.466
Uh, no.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.934
Actually, Leon is
just our waiter,

06:40.968 --> 06:43.671
and we let him think he
owns the place, you know.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.005
[laughter]

06:45.038 --> 06:46.574
On Thursdays he
thinks he's the mayor.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.541
[laughter]

06:48.776 --> 06:50.911
Well, you know how all
men like to think they

06:50.944 --> 06:52.880
are the center of the universe.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.016
I guess that's why they call it
the sun, and not the daughter.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.618
[laughter]

06:57.651 --> 07:00.688
Oh, that is brilliant.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.156
You're certainly a lot
wittier than that French lady

07:03.190 --> 07:04.858
we met at the door.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.294
Well, I do write
the newsletter.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.228
Oh, you do?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.362
Uh-huh.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.864
What line of work are you in?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.633
Well, my family owns
a string of bakeries

07:12.666 --> 07:14.835
throughout the entire state.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.604
- Bakeries, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.539
So I guess you would make
things like, I don't know,

07:18.572 --> 07:19.507
what, hamburger buns?

07:19.540 --> 07:20.474
[laughter]

07:20.508 --> 07:23.744
Oh, I love that brooch, Flo.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.913
Why thanks, Ro.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.347
My husband gave it to me.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.217
Well, uh, either he
did something very bad,

07:30.250 --> 07:31.685
or you did something very good.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.320
[laughter]

07:34.855 --> 07:37.958
Oh, You know, Ro, I bet you
are just full of the dickens.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.860
Oh, yes, I've got
the dickens just

07:39.893 --> 07:41.328
running right out of my ears.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.730
[laughter]

07:42.763 --> 07:44.164
Well, the meeting's
about to start.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.365
Maybe we can chat after.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.299
Oh, I can't wait.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.735
[laughter]

07:47.768 --> 07:49.202
I gotta hand it
to you, Roseanne.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.639
You were very pleasant
and personable.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.773
Yeah, it was fun, too.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.742
Although I know I'll
be sore tomorrow.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.209
[laughter]

07:56.243 --> 07:58.612
[music playing]

08:16.463 --> 08:18.331
Hey, can I help you, buddy?

08:18.365 --> 08:19.232
Beer.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.601
Ha, ha, ha.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.969
I didn't know you
were working here.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.537
Ah, you know me.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.439
Eccentric millionaire,
taking on odd jobs

08:26.473 --> 08:28.742
so he can mingle
with the common folk.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.243
That's what I like
about you, Chuck.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.344
You're not stuck up.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.746
Not like our other
millionaire friend

08:32.780 --> 08:33.847
who works down at the car wash.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.583
[laughter]

08:37.751 --> 08:40.654
Whoa, what the hell
are you doing here?

08:40.688 --> 08:42.122
Oh, man.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.624
He comes in here every
night, around seven.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.363
Mind if we talk?

08:50.397 --> 08:52.332
We'll have to keep our voices
down, this being the library,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.233
and all.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.401
[laughter]

08:54.434 --> 08:56.103
Just leave me
alone, Dan, will you?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.605
Why the hell
aren't you in class?

08:57.638 --> 08:58.772
Look, I went a
couple of times.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.641
But it's just not my thing, OK?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.776
What do you mean,
it wasn't your thing?

09:02.810 --> 09:03.944
We gave you money for school.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.045
We own your thing.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.279
[laughter]

09:07.347 --> 09:09.349
It just didn't
work out, so I quit.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.450
You know, what
you want me to do?

09:10.483 --> 09:11.752
How about showing
the family you've

09:11.785 --> 09:14.187
got this much responsibility?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.857
Man, I can't believe I took
your side back at the house.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.760
Hey, I don't need
you on my side.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.729
Wait a minute, you're not
gonna tell Becky or Mrs.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.196
Conner you saw me here, right?

09:23.230 --> 09:26.634
Naw, you are.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.068
Then why don't you
save them the trouble,

09:28.101 --> 09:29.102
and kill me right now?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.570
Oh, come on, Mark.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.840
Roseanne's not gonna kill you.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.574
Not with all the questions
surrounding the death

09:34.608 --> 09:35.643
of Becky's first husband.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.610
[laughter]

09:36.644 --> 09:39.046
[music playing]

09:40.147 --> 09:42.549
[music playing]

09:44.117 --> 09:48.455
So then, uh, Carol Collins,
you know, the pie lady--

09:48.488 --> 09:51.124
she ends up leaving with Nancy.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.626
[laughter]

09:53.727 --> 09:54.962
No way, mom.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.063
I know that woman.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.330
She's married.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.465
God, you're so naive.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.733
[laughter]

10:00.734 --> 10:03.336
Hey, Mark, how was it tonight?

10:03.370 --> 10:06.206
Tell them.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.540
I quit school.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.475
What?

10:08.508 --> 10:09.576
Yeah, I went a
couple of times.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.911
It just didn't work out.

10:10.944 --> 10:11.979
I found him down at the Lobo.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.280
He's been hanging out
there every night.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.048
How could you do
something like this?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.017
See, I knew you
wouldn't be on my side.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.218
On your side?

10:18.251 --> 10:19.586
Why should I be on your side?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.888
You've been lying
to me for weeks.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.056
Becky, come on, let's just
talk about this upstairs.

10:23.090 --> 10:23.957
No.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.193
I've nothing to say to you.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.495
Becky, oh, you got
plenty to say to him.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.298
Starting with get your
butt back to school.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.565
I can't make him go.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.633
I don't control him.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.902
What do you mean
you don't control him?

10:34.935 --> 10:35.803
You're his wife!

10:35.836 --> 10:37.204
[laughter]

10:37.237 --> 10:39.439
Yeah, but I still
can't make him go back.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.674
He doesn't even listen to me.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.342
Well, that's because you're
not yelling loud enough!

10:42.375 --> 10:44.011
[laughter]

10:44.044 --> 10:45.645
I'm not so sure you
should blame her, Roseanne.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.214
I mean, Mark's got
a mind of his own.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.615
Yeah, well, I got
an exercise bike too,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.818
but that don't mean
I'm ever gonna use it!

10:50.851 --> 10:52.285
[laughter]

10:53.286 --> 10:55.588
[music playing]

11:01.962 --> 11:04.064
Come on, Lucky.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.166
Come on out of that
coma for Luke and Laura.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.567
[laughter]

11:08.601 --> 11:10.838
Will Liz Taylor's
curse never end?

11:10.871 --> 11:12.539
[laughter]

11:14.407 --> 11:15.608
Sit there.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.444
Mom, this is Elijah.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.345
Hi.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.147
Oh, hi.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.915
You must be Florence's boy.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.483
Nice to meet ya.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.384
OK.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.552
I talked to him in school.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.454
I brought him home
like you told me to.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.355
And now I'm done.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.290
[laughter]

11:30.323 --> 11:31.759
Where are you going?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.260
Izzy Miller's house.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.427
DJ--
[snap]

11:34.461 --> 11:35.729
--over here.
[door closing]

11:37.130 --> 11:39.599
Now you stop being mean to
Elijah and play with him.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.500
I can't.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.935
He sings.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.837
What do you mean, he sings?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.673
He sings real quietly
to himself all the time.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.508
He never stops.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.043
I hate him, I hate
him, I hate him!

11:50.077 --> 11:51.078
[laughter]

11:51.111 --> 11:53.680
DJ, you get a hold
of yourself, now.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.948
You are gonna play with him.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.349
He's a very nice boy.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.651
If you like him so
much, you play with him.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.020
[laughter]

12:00.053 --> 12:05.793
[quietly singing] Puff the
magic dragon lived by the sea.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.726
And frolicked--

12:06.760 --> 12:07.861
Told you.

12:07.895 --> 12:13.200
--in the autumn mist
in a land called Honali.

12:13.233 --> 12:18.105
[singing] Little
Jackie Paper--

12:18.138 --> 12:20.007
How come you stopped?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.708
Stopped what?

12:21.741 --> 12:22.642
Singing.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.543
I wasn't singing.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.411
[laughter]

12:25.412 --> 12:27.180
Hey, DJ, who's your friend?

12:27.214 --> 12:28.115
Izzy Miller.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.482
[laughter]

12:29.516 --> 12:30.851
I know that, son.

12:30.884 --> 12:31.919
But who's this boy?

12:31.952 --> 12:34.354
[singing] We're off
to see the wizard.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.355
DJ: This is Elijah.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.756
[singing] The
wonderful Wizard of Oz.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.225
I hear he is--

12:38.258 --> 12:39.259
What's he doing?

12:39.292 --> 12:40.427
[laughter]

12:40.460 --> 12:41.561
Singing.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.896
[singing] If ever, oh
ever a wiz there was--

12:42.930 --> 12:44.097
How do you get him to stop?

12:44.131 --> 12:45.532
[laughter]

12:45.565 --> 12:47.034
[singing] Because,
because, because,

12:47.067 --> 12:48.501
because, because, because!

12:48.535 --> 12:50.437
[laughter]

12:52.505 --> 12:53.907
[applause]

12:56.977 --> 13:02.449
So, Elijah, you
like to sing, huh?

13:02.482 --> 13:05.118
I wasn't singing.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.154
Yeah, Dan, what's
wrong with you?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.521
[laughter]

13:09.522 --> 13:11.524
Can I stay here for dinner?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.026
Sure, if you'd like to.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.161
What are you having?

13:14.194 --> 13:18.231
Liver and boiled
fish, with liver sauce.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.166
[laughter]

13:19.199 --> 13:21.534
I think I gotta go home now.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.469
Bummer.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.871
[laughter]

13:24.872 --> 13:26.106
[door closing]

13:26.139 --> 13:29.342
Oh, we've just gotta have
that kid over more often.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.277
[laughter]

13:30.310 --> 13:32.012
He makes our other
kids less odd.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.046
[laughter]

13:33.080 --> 13:35.415
I think every kid
on Earth looks less

13:35.448 --> 13:37.817
odd next to Elijah Minnelli.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.086
[laughter]

13:39.119 --> 13:41.088
[singing] Start
spreading the news.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.222
[laughter]

13:42.255 --> 13:44.657
That's Elijah with a "J."

13:44.691 --> 13:45.926
[laughter]

13:47.727 --> 13:49.729
Hey.
- Shh.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.798
Mark's reading.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.434
Oh, well, I hate to ruin
the end of it for you Mark,

13:54.467 --> 13:56.503
but he eats the
green eggs and ham.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.138
[laughter]

13:59.139 --> 14:02.042
I'm studying upstairs.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.043
Don't pick on him, mom.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.611
He's really doing
it the this time.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.046
We spent all day
working together.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.515
I can't believe how
much he's learned.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.683
Well, does this mean that we
have to stop spelling stuff out

14:10.717 --> 14:11.952
that we don't want
him to know about?

14:11.985 --> 14:13.520
[laughter]

14:13.553 --> 14:14.922
I'm serious.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.389
I mean, you were right, mom.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.591
You can make husbands
do, like, anything.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.361
You are catching
on, Mrs. Healy.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.663
Men need to be molded.

14:23.696 --> 14:28.701
Think of them, not as lumps
of clay, but as lumps.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.503
[laughter]

14:31.604 --> 14:32.539
[belch]

14:32.572 --> 14:34.074
[laughter]

14:35.075 --> 14:36.476
Out of milk.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.445
[laughter]

14:38.478 --> 14:40.347
[music playing]

14:53.260 --> 14:56.229
Oh, hi, Flo and Elijah.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.764
Cool hats.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.666
Thanks, Roseanne.

14:59.699 --> 15:03.236
We biked over here to talk
to you about your son.

15:03.270 --> 15:08.041
Well, he did something that
really upset my Elijah.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.342
Well, thank you
for telling me.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.611
I will punish him severely.

15:11.644 --> 15:12.980
But don't you want
to know what he did?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.647
[laughter]

15:14.681 --> 15:15.615
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.516
That'd be good.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.417
[laughter]

15:18.851 --> 15:21.021
Well, yesterday, in front
of a large group of children,

15:21.054 --> 15:24.324
DJ called him Elijah Minnelli.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.159
[laughter]

15:34.667 --> 15:36.069
No, he didn't.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.037
[laughter]

15:38.038 --> 15:40.573
DJ, come out here!

15:40.607 --> 15:42.075
Children can be so cruel.

15:42.109 --> 15:42.976
[laughter]

15:43.977 --> 15:45.878
What?

15:45.912 --> 15:47.714
I'm gonna pretend
like I'm yelling at you,

15:47.747 --> 15:48.915
so just go along with it.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.816
OK.

15:49.849 --> 15:50.817
[laughter]

15:52.052 --> 15:54.021
DJ, I'm going to ask
you a simple question,

15:54.054 --> 15:57.024
and I want a simple
answer, yes or no.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.027
Did you call him
Elijah Minnelli?

16:00.060 --> 16:00.927
Yes, but you--

16:00.960 --> 16:02.762
Yes or no.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.664
Yes.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.001
Well, you really
hurt his feelings, DJ.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.437
As you know, I did not raise
you to be a name caller.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.338
That is mean.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.206
[laughter]

16:16.176 --> 16:17.810
Tell him you're sorry.

16:17.844 --> 16:18.811
I'm sorry.

16:18.845 --> 16:19.712
That's OK.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.913
You wanna come over tomorrow?

16:20.947 --> 16:22.515
Uh, no, I bet I'm grounded.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.416
You sure are.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.351
[laughter]

16:24.384 --> 16:25.185
See?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.323
All right, then.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.991
Thank you, Ro.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.361
I'll look forward to seeing
you at the next meeting.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.795
Me too, Flo.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.231
And don't you worry about
it, because I'm not quite

16:38.265 --> 16:40.500
done talking to this young man.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.403
DJ: Mom, I said I was sorry!

16:43.436 --> 16:45.605
Well, sorry really
isn't good enough, is it?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.107
Come on, I'll change!

16:47.140 --> 16:48.075
I promise I will!

16:48.108 --> 16:49.076
Please!

16:49.109 --> 16:51.044
Please, I promise!

16:51.078 --> 16:53.080
That's what you say
every single time.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.047
I will!
I will!

16:54.081 --> 16:55.348
[door closing]
They're gone.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.249
Let's go have ice cream.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.717
[laughter]

16:57.750 --> 16:58.718
[applause]

16:58.751 --> 17:01.121
[music playing]

17:11.164 --> 17:12.265
Hey, Mark.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.000
I made flashcards for
the next two chapters.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.235
Yeah?
Ha.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.369
We got our tests back.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.105
The only F in the class.

17:18.138 --> 17:21.174
They even posted the grades
where everybody could see them.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.075
Are you proud of me?

17:22.109 --> 17:23.143
You studied for this.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.511
I don't understand
how this could happen.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.346
Well you should never have
made me go to that damn school

17:26.379 --> 17:27.480
in the first place.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.381
I didn't make you.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.316
You wanted to go.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.183
Wrong.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.384
You never even asked me.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.353
Then again, you don't
give a crap what I think.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.954
You never have.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.723
Hey, could you guys
start over again?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.158
I hate it when I miss
out on the beginning.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.226
[laughter]

17:40.627 --> 17:43.163
And you, Mrs. Conner, you
always thought I was stupid.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.464
Now here's your proof.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.934
Go ahead, make your jokes.

17:47.967 --> 17:51.738
Well it's really not funny,
now that we know it's true.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.540
[laughter]

17:59.279 --> 18:02.048
In fact, it's kinda sad.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.552
Or at least, not as funny.
[laughter]

18:05.585 --> 18:07.154
Mom, he's not stupid.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.521
He's just not good
at taking tests!

18:08.555 --> 18:10.423
Yeah, well I think when you
don't know any of the answers

18:10.457 --> 18:12.525
to any of the questions, you're
not good at taking tests.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.793
[laughter]

18:13.826 --> 18:14.894
Yeah, but look here.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.263
You spelled your name right.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.365
Although it is the 15th.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.666
[laughter]

18:19.699 --> 18:21.934
Mom, leave us alone.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.370
Oh, I'm just
teasing you, Mark.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.637
Everybody gets an
F. You're going

18:24.671 --> 18:25.538
to do way better next time.

18:25.572 --> 18:26.439
No.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.674
No, I won't.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.609
I'm dropping out.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.943
Becky.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.912
Mark, you're going back.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.181
We both know it's
what's best for you.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.415
No, it's what's best for you!

18:35.448 --> 18:37.350
I mean, why are you always
trying to change me?

18:37.384 --> 18:38.885
I'm not trying to change you!

18:38.918 --> 18:42.255
I just want you to realize
you're not worthless!

18:42.289 --> 18:44.090
I never thought
I was worthless.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.124
That's not what I meant.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.058
What are you doing?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.627
I'm gonna stay
at Roy's tonight.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.828
Why?
What do you mean?

18:48.861 --> 18:50.397
Well you're the great student.
You figure it out.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.932
Go find some college
boy's got what you want.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.768
Mark, wait!

18:55.802 --> 18:56.736
[door opening]

18:56.769 --> 18:57.670
[door closing]

18:59.239 --> 19:00.973
Well, mother, I kept
pushing him, like you said,

19:01.007 --> 19:02.242
and he left me.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.677
Congratulations, you
finally broke us up!

19:04.711 --> 19:06.045
Well, it doesn't count.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.046
I wasn't even trying.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.481
[laughter]

19:08.515 --> 19:10.417
[music playing]

19:10.450 --> 19:12.285
[applause]

19:15.288 --> 19:16.623
No, you guys can't break up.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.857
Listen to me.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.659
I gave some advice
to my daughter.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.628
And, OK, well that kind
of blew up in my face.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.765
But trust me, you
two belong together.

19:25.798 --> 19:26.699
I don't know, Roseanne.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.635
[cheering]

19:32.239 --> 19:37.076
We've been through so much,
and it just gets harder.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.878
You wouldn't believe the
incredible drama that we're

19:38.911 --> 19:40.380
always going through.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.281
[laughter]

19:41.314 --> 19:42.749
Oh, wouldn't I?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.183
Dan, come out here!

19:44.217 --> 19:45.117
DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.018
I got two hands.

19:46.052 --> 19:49.256
What the-- oh, yes, dear.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.625
I'd like to introduce
you to somebody famous.

19:52.659 --> 19:56.829
Oh, man, this is a real honor.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.831
Think Paul Simon and you will
ever get back together again?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.700
[laughter]

20:04.136 --> 20:05.505
Oh, no.

20:05.538 --> 20:10.477
Uh, no, we're-- we're Luke and
Laura from "General Hospital."

20:10.510 --> 20:11.378
Oh, sorry.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.946
I'm a "Guiding Light" man.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.182
They were telling me about
all the trouble they're having

20:16.215 --> 20:17.484
in their marriage,
so I thought you

20:17.517 --> 20:19.151
should tell them some of the
stuff we've been through.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.086
Oh, OK.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.187
Well, I don't know
where to start.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.990
See, last year I lost my job.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.625
My daughter ran off.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.160
Sister-in-law got beat up.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.429
I got thrown in jail.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.797
Roseanne's dad died.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.699
[laughter]

20:33.966 --> 20:37.003
Yeah, it seems like
every week something else

20:37.036 --> 20:37.970
is happening to us.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.439
[laughter]

20:39.472 --> 20:42.074
It seems like it happens
again in the summer, too.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.477
[laughter]

20:46.045 --> 20:48.315
Well, he got in a
fight with my ex-husband

20:48.348 --> 20:49.449
on our wedding day.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.683
Well, that was
only because you

20:50.717 --> 20:53.185
didn't make sure that stupid
Mexican divorce from him

20:53.219 --> 20:54.854
was legal.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.490
Well, our daughter Becky left
home for a year and a half.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.426
And when she came back,
we barely recognized her.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.328
[laughter]

21:04.897 --> 21:09.502
But the most important thing
is, we've stuck together.

21:09.536 --> 21:13.406
Now you two still love
each other, don't you?

21:13.440 --> 21:17.444
Well, I did really
miss you those two years

21:17.477 --> 21:19.846
that I was abducted and
held captive on that island.

21:19.879 --> 21:20.880
[laughter]

21:21.981 --> 21:23.650
And I'll never
forget the good times

21:23.683 --> 21:25.785
we had saving the world
from Mikkos Cassadine's

21:25.818 --> 21:26.686
evil weather machine.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.887
[laughter]

21:27.920 --> 21:37.964
