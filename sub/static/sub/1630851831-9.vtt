00:06.560 --> 00:09.560
OSHER:
Previously on The Bachelorette...

00:09.560 --> 00:12.000
BROOKE:
I think this is, like, beautiful.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.480
Look at our bracelets.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.800
Love bracelets.
Love bracelets.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.920
So you always have
a little piece of me.

00:16.920 --> 00:20.520
..Holly continued to weave her way
into Brooke's heart.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.720
You are a little angel.

00:23.800 --> 00:27.800
Then Brooke lobbed in
a cocktail party hand grenade...

00:27.800 --> 00:31.680
"Brooke will choose the person
who gets the final single date."

00:31.680 --> 00:33.840
I really want this tonight.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.960
..pushing everyone
to lift their game.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.120
Cheers.
Cheers.
Yes.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.720
My money is on Darv

00:39.720 --> 00:42.640
anonymously sending Brooke
some flowers.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.000
But Darvid's persistence paid off.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.920
Darvid.
Oh!

00:47.920 --> 00:49.520
This is shattering.
Like, it's heartbreaking.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.840
That does suck, yeah?
KURT: Yeah.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.160
Are you OK, Brookie?

00:53.160 --> 00:55.080
Tonight...
Whoo! (SIGHS)

00:55.080 --> 00:56.680
Nerves are kicking in.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.560
Today, I'm literally baring it all.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.600
..it's the Bachelorette
in all her glory...

01:02.600 --> 01:05.480
JAMIE-LEE: Wow!
I'm kind of in awe at this moment.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.240
..as Brooke lays it all on the table.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.280
I want them to see all of me -

01:10.280 --> 01:14.440
all my flaws, all
my vulnerabilities, all my scars -

01:14.440 --> 01:16.040
and still love me.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.600
But will Konrad's contribution...

01:18.600 --> 01:19.960
You remembered.
Yeah.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.200
That's really, really sweet.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.000
..seal the deal with Brooke?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.840
This is why I just, like...
I'm naturally so drawn to you.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.600
I always feel very grateful
to be around you.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.720
Tough to hear.
It's intimidating.
Yeah. It's tough.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.120
It's gonna be five of us
getting our hearts broken, I think.

01:46.920 --> 01:51.240
Whoo-hoo!
I wonder what we're doing today.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.760
Today is the final group date,

01:52.760 --> 01:55.200
and we're down to the final six,

01:55.200 --> 01:58.840
and that is really weighing
on my mind.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.800
Morning, ladies. Morning, gentlemen.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.680
Good morning.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.200
We all know that Darv's already got
the last single date with Brooke.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.600
Look, we're all
feeling the pressure.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.640
Can you believe
this is the last ever group date?

02:13.640 --> 02:16.160
No.
No.
Wow.

02:16.160 --> 02:21.120
Everyone's
a little bit nervous to find out
what today is actually gonna be.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.120
So, Brooke,

02:23.120 --> 02:25.880
how important to you is inner beauty?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.360
BROOKE: It's really important.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.960
I'm looking
for an unconditional love, so...

02:29.960 --> 02:35.120
..I want to know you see the
inner me - like, the actual real me.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.400
With that in mind,
today you'll be exploring

02:40.400 --> 02:43.880
who it is
that you believe Brooke to be.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.480
And you'll be expressing yourself

02:47.480 --> 02:49.320
through art.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.600
(LAUGHTER)
Oh, no.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.440
Oh, no!

02:53.440 --> 02:55.080
I absolutely suck at art.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.400
I think the last time I did art
was probably in Year 7,

02:57.400 --> 03:00.080
when I was about
13 or 14 years old, so...

03:00.080 --> 03:03.200
..I'm feeling super-tense.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.000
You will either sketch or paint

03:08.000 --> 03:11.680
what it is you see
when you look at Brooke.

03:13.440 --> 03:18.080
And later, you'll have the chance
to unveil your masterwork to her

03:18.080 --> 03:21.600
in an art exhibition just for one.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.600
Both my parents are artists,
and growing up, we were encouraged

03:24.600 --> 03:28.040
to do a lot of art, so...
hopefully, I can channel them today

03:28.040 --> 03:30.880
and create something pretty special.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.360
Bear in mind...

03:32.360 --> 03:35.800
..Brooke has a big decision looming.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.520
She's gonna have to choose
who she takes on hometowns.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.400
Which makes this date
even more important, because tonight,

03:48.400 --> 03:52.320
she will choose just one of you
to spend some time alone with.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.040
I think all of us
are at the stage where we want to

03:59.040 --> 04:02.760
take Brooke home
to meet our families, and...

04:02.760 --> 04:05.880
..if Brooke doesn't see a future
with you, that's not gonna happen,

04:05.880 --> 04:08.480
so...this is...

04:08.480 --> 04:10.080
..very daunting.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.720
Brooke, why don't you head on inside?
Thank you.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.800
Get yourself ready.
Alright. See you guys soon.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.360
See ya.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.720
Brooke's just gonna take a few
minutes and chat with the art teacher

04:20.720 --> 04:24.560
who is gonna be taking you
through today, so...once she's ready,

04:24.560 --> 04:26.680
head on in
and I'll see you when you're done.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.240
Have a great date.
Thank you.
Thanks, Osher.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.800
JAMIE-LEE: I feel like
Brooke has got a really difficult

04:31.800 --> 04:32.920
decision to make.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.920
She has connections
with everyone here.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.000
I think that I see Brooke
for who she really is.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.840
I think I always have.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.280
So it's just about
getting that on paper.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.800
My heart is racing
going into today's group date,

04:50.800 --> 04:55.160
because I'm doing something
a little bit different.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.120
Whoo! (SIGHS)

04:57.120 --> 04:59.680
Nerves are kicking in.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.160
I'm a very comfortable person
in my own skin,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.160
externally and also internally,

05:04.160 --> 05:06.960
but today, I am...

05:06.960 --> 05:09.560
..feeling very vulnerable, because...

05:09.560 --> 05:11.360
..I'm literally baring it all.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.920
Are you OK, Brookie?

05:12.920 --> 05:15.600
Feel good?
I feel good, yeah. Yeah.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.760
It's extremely scary being naked.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.920
Have you life-modelled before?

05:22.920 --> 05:24.200
No.

05:24.200 --> 05:29.520
Every time a woman is naked,
it's immediately sexualised,

05:29.520 --> 05:32.960
and today is not about that.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.480
It's always fun to see
what people do, like with you.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.920
It's quite revealing, yeah.
Yeah.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.880
I came here
looking for an unconditional love,

05:41.880 --> 05:47.600
and I've got six amazing
potential partners left, and...

05:47.600 --> 05:50.040
..I want them to see all of me -

05:50.040 --> 05:52.160
physically, emotionally, spiritually,

05:52.160 --> 05:57.280
all my flaws, all my vulnerabilities,
all my scars -

05:57.280 --> 05:58.720
and still love me.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.480
Yeah. And still love me.
(LAUGHS) Love all of me.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.520
(SIGHS)

06:08.120 --> 06:10.320
(SIGHS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

06:11.760 --> 06:13.120
Hey.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.040
Hello, guys.
Hi.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.280
Well, hello!
(LAUGHS)

06:18.280 --> 06:21.560
I'm actually seriously surprised

06:21.560 --> 06:24.960
to find Brooke sitting there
with only a blanket covering her.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.160
She looks amazing.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.720
Props to her, because she knows
she's putting herself

06:28.720 --> 06:31.480
in a really vulnerable position.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.600
Wow!

06:33.600 --> 06:34.720
Oh!

06:34.720 --> 06:37.560
She looks so beautiful. (LAUGHS)

06:37.560 --> 06:39.880
I'm kind of in awe at this moment.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.000
I really am.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.240
Welcome, everybody.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.720
Laura is the artist
that has come on board today

06:46.720 --> 06:50.680
to help everyone express themselves.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.880
The aim of the session is to explore

06:53.880 --> 06:57.600
how Brooke makes you feel
and how you feel about Brooke.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.960
This was actually my idea.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.040
It came from
a bit of a dream that I had.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.600
And it's nothing to do
with sexualisation of a woman's body.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.600
It's a bit more powerful than that.

07:10.600 --> 07:15.240
It's about what you see, like, not
with your eyes but with your heart.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.520
So let's get started, shall we?

07:30.200 --> 07:33.160
The mood in the air
is pretty, like, intense.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.600
HOLLY: Everyone
is very engrossed in their work,

07:40.600 --> 07:45.640
and everyone is taking this group
date really, really seriously.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.920
I was hoping I could paint your hand
and get you to put a handprint.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.400
Straightaway?

07:51.400 --> 07:52.560
Is that OK with you?
Yeah.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.280
You can see brains ticking.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.600
You can see paintbrushes going.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.920
No-one's talking. No-one's laughing.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.280
(LAUGHS)

08:01.280 --> 08:05.240
Everyone's really aware
of what's riding on today.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.720
(LAUGHS) I'm doing my best.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.000
(LAUGHS)

08:10.920 --> 08:12.400
Brooke's a beautiful girl
on the outside,

08:12.400 --> 08:15.240
but she's
even more beautiful on the inside.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.040
Konrad, you're in the zone.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.560
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.080
I've had some great chats
with Brooke,

08:23.080 --> 08:26.160
and I've really listened
the whole time,

08:26.160 --> 08:30.760
and the thoughts, the ideas are just
rushing through my head right now.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.480
I really want
to make an impact today.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.280
How are you feeling, Darvid?
(BOTH LAUGH)

08:39.280 --> 08:40.640
(LAUGHS)

08:40.640 --> 08:45.280
I'm, um...I'm struggling
to get across what I want.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.920
There's only six of us left,

08:46.920 --> 08:49.400
so no-one's thinking about
next week.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.320
We're all thinking about
the end now. Or at least I am.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.400
Today is a chance to say things

08:58.400 --> 09:01.000
that we haven't been able
to tell her via words.

09:02.360 --> 09:05.880
I'm trying to put my heart
on a piece of paper.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.040
Kurtie, you're really quiet.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.480
Yeah. Concentrating.
It's a lot of thought.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.720
The stakes are high today,
and, you know, I feel like

09:17.720 --> 09:21.200
I've got these big ideas already
circulating through my head.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.240
Oh, does anyone know
how to make the colour grey?

09:24.240 --> 09:26.920
Black and white.
Oh. Thanks.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.000
(LAUGHS)

09:29.000 --> 09:31.280
HOLLY: Oh, Kurt!
What?

09:31.280 --> 09:34.480
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:34.480 --> 09:35.680
It's kind of confusing me.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.240
Um...

09:37.240 --> 09:42.400
..you know, I need the basic 101
art painting lesson where it's like,

09:42.400 --> 09:43.760
you know,
"This is green. This is red.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.760
"Green and red make...yellow?"

09:53.440 --> 09:55.160
JAMIE-LEE: I know who Brooke is.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.760
I know who she is
at the core of her heart.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.720
I know her values and...

09:59.720 --> 10:03.480
..what she wants out of life
and what she has to offer, so...

10:03.480 --> 10:08.840
..if I can figure out a way
to put that on paper, I may be OK.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.160
But how do you do that?

10:11.160 --> 10:13.640
HOLLY: I actually don't hate mine.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.240
It's the thought that counts.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.880
Yeah.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.320
(SIGHS)

10:23.320 --> 10:25.800
OSHER: Coming up...
Alright. Here we go.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.040
..an art exhibition for one...

10:28.040 --> 10:31.440
Oh, my God! It got me so emotional.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.760
Oh, don't do that.
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

10:32.760 --> 10:34.120
You're gonna make ME cry.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.480
..causes heartache...

10:36.480 --> 10:38.080
It's intimidating.
Yeah. It's tough.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.320
Mmm.
..for many.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.760
It's gonna be five of us
getting our hearts broken, I think.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.680
(SOBS)

10:44.680 --> 10:46.120
(SNIFFLES)

10:55.560 --> 10:58.800
BROOKE: It's finally time
to sit down with everyone

10:58.800 --> 11:00.720
and see their artwork,

11:00.720 --> 11:04.240
and I'm really curious to see
what everyone has come up with.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.280
It's a crucial time at the moment,
because we're going into hometowns

11:09.280 --> 11:11.240
and I have to think about
who I'm taking.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.840
Cheers, guys.
Cheers.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.480
Last group date.
Cheers.
Last group date.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.880
There's only
a small amount of people left,

11:17.880 --> 11:21.200
and I have connections
with all of them, so...

11:21.200 --> 11:23.200
..this is really important for me.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.480
Hello.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.320
Hi!
Oh! A little dance in.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.480
You're excited. Mwah!
(LAUGHS)

11:32.480 --> 11:35.360
How are you?
I'm good. I had fun today.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.120
Did you?
I did! I did.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.560
This is probably the most nervous
I've felt on a group date.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.480
Brooke wants to know
that you see the real her.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.400
And...I'm hoping

11:46.400 --> 11:50.720
that I have expressed the real her
in my artwork.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.200
Yeah.
Do you want to see it?
I'd love to see it.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.800
OK.
Yeah. Go for it.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.800
Oh, my God!

11:59.800 --> 12:01.520
Wow. It's actually really good.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.240
(LAUGHS) Wow!

12:04.240 --> 12:05.920
So...
OK. Talk to me.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.600
So, there's, like,
a couple of things going on.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.720
First part is,
I think you're a really open person.
OK.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.920
So I wanted to portray that
with your face and your chest up.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.720
Oh, wow.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.440
And then I used
really warm colours because

12:21.440 --> 12:23.680
I think you're a really warm person,

12:23.680 --> 12:27.680
and I feel really at home
whenever I'm with you, and...

12:27.680 --> 12:31.000
..I know that I, like, stumble
over my words all the time. (LAUGHS)

12:31.000 --> 12:35.080
But I do feel, like,
really safe when I'm with you.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.600
Gosh! Stop it, Holly.

12:39.600 --> 12:43.760
And I wanted to use colours that
show, like, confidence and passion

12:43.760 --> 12:47.720
and culture
and all the things that I think of

12:47.720 --> 12:49.080
when I think of you.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.480
Oh! Stop it, you.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.360
(LAUGHS) Oh.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
Man, she's nailing this.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.680
Yeah.
She's killing it.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.840
I love this!
Yeah.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.560
It's so beautiful.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.240
I love the colours.
Yeah.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.560
This woman, I, like...

13:04.560 --> 13:07.240
It's you.
..this is me.
Yeah.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.240
Oh.
Oh!

13:08.240 --> 13:10.120
Come here, big sweetie.
Oh, I love this.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.280
I honestly love Holly's painting.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.720
It's so beautiful.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.080
Oh. I love it. Thank you so much.
It's OK.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.
OK?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.800
And I love that

13:28.800 --> 13:32.040
she said that I feel safe for her
and that I feel like home,

13:32.040 --> 13:35.320
'cause that's definitely
what I'm looking for in a partner.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.800
(INAUDIBLE)

13:36.800 --> 13:39.840
And I'm so glad
that she feels like that with me.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.680
It's clear that they do have
a really strong connection, hey?
Yeah.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.120
Massive.
Definitely.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.320
Tough to follow.
Yeah.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.480
The bar is set real high.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.800
(LAUGHS) Oh! I'm next. I'm next.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.160
Sitting there and watching people

13:53.160 --> 13:54.680
talk about
their connection with Brooke

13:54.680 --> 13:57.120
is a little bit hectic.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.040
Ooh! OK!

14:00.040 --> 14:02.280
The way you make me feel...
Yeah.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.520
..when you walk into a room is...

14:04.520 --> 14:05.960
..it goes from...

14:05.960 --> 14:09.120
..grey for me
to colour.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.120
Aw!

14:10.120 --> 14:13.560
Oh, Darvid.
(LAUGHTER)

14:13.560 --> 14:15.200
I haven't really seen

14:15.200 --> 14:19.320
Brooke interact very much with
other people in the mansion, so...

14:19.320 --> 14:20.640
..this is really hard to watch.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.200
Mwah!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:24.200 --> 14:26.360
Silver-tongued devil.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.000
I almost feel like
I shouldn't be watching.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.960
They are such intimate moments.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.400
I know that you say
that you...

14:33.400 --> 14:34.840
..you want an unconditional love.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.880
And...
Mmm.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.560
..if I love someone,
it's always unconditional.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.080
I'd rather not see that

14:41.080 --> 14:43.920
and focus on
my connection with Brooke.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.680
Alright, so...yes, painting,
I think we both know...

14:47.680 --> 14:49.080
(LAUGHS)

14:49.080 --> 14:52.200
..it's not necessarily
my strong point.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.640
JAMIE-LEE: I'm putting on
a brave face and smiling

14:54.640 --> 14:58.640
and being so supportive of everyone,
because I genuinely care about them.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.760
But, yeah,
of course I'm a little jealous.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.760
I see you as such
a strong and resilient person

15:06.760 --> 15:09.600
who's proud of who you are,

15:09.600 --> 15:13.160
and I think those qualities, to me,
are...are super-special.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.000
Thank you so much.
Mmm. No worries.
Give me a big cuddle.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.840
Mmm.
Mmm, mmm.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.440
You're just so cute.
Mmm.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.920
Yeah, today is probably
the most vulnerable I've felt

15:22.920 --> 15:24.600
this whole experience.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.920
It's really confronting

15:25.920 --> 15:28.200
seeing the connections
that Brooke's formed with everyone.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.520
There's no hiding from it anymore.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.200
Hello.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.800
Damn! You look good.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.320
Thank you.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.840
I'm not gonna lie. I'm quietly
freaking out right now. (LAUGHS)

15:41.840 --> 15:43.880
Had a good day?
I DID have a good day.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.760
I'm definitely falling
for this girl.

15:46.760 --> 15:50.440
I just really hope
that my artwork makes sense

15:50.440 --> 15:52.440
and it speaks to Brooke.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.360
Are you happy
with what you've created today?

15:54.360 --> 15:56.560
It's pretty basic, but...

15:56.560 --> 15:58.160
..I think
I've got the message across.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.360
So...
OK.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.640
Are you saying I'm basic?

16:00.640 --> 16:02.240
No, no. No, you're not basic.
(LAUGHS)

16:02.240 --> 16:04.200
No, no, no. My painting's basic.
I was, like...oh, I get it.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.840
(LAUGHS)
You'll see.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.680
Alright. Are you ready to...?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Are you ready to show me?

16:08.680 --> 16:11.040
OK.
Alright. Here we go.
Yeah.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.800
Here we go. (LAUGHS)
Oh, my God! It's so cute!

16:16.800 --> 16:18.720
It's...it's a little cute, isn't it?

16:18.720 --> 16:20.400
That's not basic!

16:20.400 --> 16:22.800
Oh, wow!
Jeez!

16:26.840 --> 16:28.760
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

16:28.760 --> 16:29.840
So basically, um,

16:29.840 --> 16:31.080
it's a silhouette of you,

16:31.080 --> 16:32.920
so that's your shoulders

16:32.920 --> 16:34.920
and...and a silhouette of your hair.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.280
Oh, my God, it is!
Hair looks stunning today.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.720
Wow.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.560
The tree represents

16:41.560 --> 16:44.880
wisdom and knowledge for me, and...

16:44.880 --> 16:47.120
..I think you're super-smart,

16:47.120 --> 16:49.440
so...you're a tree
of knowledge and wisdom.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.080
Um...
(LAUGHS)

16:51.080 --> 16:53.200
..but you're also very grounded.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.240
So, your roots are strong

16:55.240 --> 16:57.080
in this tree.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.160
And then...

16:59.160 --> 17:02.280
..every tree has its...its fruit,
and I think yours...

17:02.280 --> 17:04.120
..is your heart,
you've got so much heart.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.600
You know?

17:05.600 --> 17:07.360
Kill me.
Yes.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.280
Um...so...
you've got a big, beautiful heart,

17:10.280 --> 17:15.080
and that's your fruit
you give to people, is your heart.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.720
So...
You're making me,
like, super-emotional.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.640
(LAUGHS)
Stop it.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.320
Yeah? Come here.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.840
Um...and...
So nice.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.840
But wait, there's more. You right?

17:24.840 --> 17:26.680
Yeah.
Here, look, I've got another sleeve.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.960
(LAUGHS) No.
Yeah? OK.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.040
(SOBS) It's alright.
Um...

17:31.040 --> 17:33.200
I'll get my shit together.
(BOTH LAUGH)

17:33.200 --> 17:35.840
So, again, um...

17:37.160 --> 17:39.840
..after the group date
with the kids, it's clear

17:39.840 --> 17:41.440
that you're...
you know, you're very maternal -

17:41.440 --> 17:43.560
you love children, your youth work -

17:43.560 --> 17:46.840
um, and we've had chats before
about how many kids you want.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.120
(LAUGHS)

17:48.120 --> 17:51.360
So these are the...
the three little kids here.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.400
HOLLY: Oh.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.120
That's really, really sweet.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.920
So there's your beautiful
sunflower daughter, um, Sienna.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.760
She's wearing
her little T-shirt there.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.240
Oh, my God, you're melting me.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.080
Um...
(LAUGHS)

18:04.080 --> 18:07.600
..and then you've got your son,
the little turtle,

18:07.600 --> 18:10.840
and that's 'cause, obviously,
your totem animal is a turtle, so...

18:10.840 --> 18:12.040
You remembered.
Yeah.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.480
And then this is your...

18:13.480 --> 18:16.440
..adopted child, 'cause I know
you want to adopt a kid,

18:16.440 --> 18:18.680
and I just think
there's a special person out there,

18:18.680 --> 18:20.560
a little...a little shooting star,

18:20.560 --> 18:22.280
and I think
with your energy in them,

18:22.280 --> 18:25.360
they're just going to excel
and they're gonna be a superstar.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.840
Oh, my God. (LAUGHS)

18:29.840 --> 18:32.360
Konrad is just a big giant softie.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.080
Oh, don't do that.
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

18:35.080 --> 18:37.240
You're gonna make ME cry.
Sorry.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.080
I think you're so beautiful
when you cry.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.200
(LAUGHS)
Stop that. (LAUGHS)

18:41.200 --> 18:43.920
He is honestly...

18:43.920 --> 18:45.880
..so beautiful.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.640
(LAUGHS) It got me so emotional.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.280
I think it's so beautiful.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.440
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.760
I'm...I'm really glad you like it.
Um...I do.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.920
I really like it.
I think it really does represent me.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.920
And I think you've...it shows
that you were really paying attention

19:01.920 --> 19:03.880
and I think
you're noticing the little things,

19:03.880 --> 19:06.000
like, the detailed things, which...

19:06.000 --> 19:09.960
..I think in past relationships
hasn't always been the case.

19:09.960 --> 19:15.240
I love
that he really listens to me and...

19:15.240 --> 19:18.360
..takes everything that I say
into consideration.

19:18.360 --> 19:21.120
Oh - this is...
this is why I just, like,

19:21.120 --> 19:23.080
I'm naturally
so drawn to you, Konrad.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.320
I think...

19:24.320 --> 19:26.560
..you're
such a beautiful and humble man.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.800
I always feel very grateful
to be around you.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.640
I definitely think that...

19:31.640 --> 19:33.960
..he sees the real Brooke.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.680
Um...you are...
Stop crying.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.720
I know. You got me good, man.
(LAUGHS)

19:38.720 --> 19:40.360
(SNIFFLES)

19:42.960 --> 19:46.440
Tough to hear.
WOMEN: Mmm.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.360
It's intimidating.
Yeah. It's tough.
Mmm.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.360
Bye. See ya.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.960
Mmm.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.200
Wow. That got me good.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.680
(SOBS)

20:12.440 --> 20:14.720
How was your day?
It's good.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.960
Fun.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.720
How was it for you, Brooke?
I loved today.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.800
Everyone brought this
beautiful touch to their artwork,

20:23.800 --> 20:26.600
and I definitely feel seen.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.800
Yeah. I thought
today was really special.

20:29.800 --> 20:33.280
Well, you do have some time
set aside later this evening

20:33.280 --> 20:35.120
to spend with just one person.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.440
And...

20:37.440 --> 20:38.800
Mmm.
..you've got so much to think about.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.440
'Cause hometowns are...
are right around the corner.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.160
Yeah.

20:44.160 --> 20:48.240
The person that I am taking
on this extra time,

20:48.240 --> 20:51.720
I just love how honest and raw
this person is.

20:51.720 --> 20:56.680
And I am just, like,
amazed at their ability to

20:56.680 --> 21:00.240
make me feel emotions
that surprise me.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.560
So, Konrad...

21:04.560 --> 21:07.280
(LAUGHS) ..I would love
to spend more time with you tonight.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.000
Sick. (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) Sick.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.200
Have a great time, you two.
Come on. (LAUGHS)

21:11.200 --> 21:13.280
That feels good. (LAUGHS)

21:13.280 --> 21:16.400
I didn't come here to muck around.
I'm 31 years old.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.800
And...I'm falling for Brooke
pretty hard.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.600
And I want to let her know that.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.640
Enjoy your night.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.840
Thanks, Osher.
Thanks, Osh.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.040
(SIGHS)

21:27.040 --> 21:29.600
Watching Konrad with Brooke
sucks, to be honest.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.640
I saw that coming from a mile away.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.560
JAMIE-LEE: He's so thoughtful,

21:34.560 --> 21:38.680
and it's triggering
emotions in Brooke, and...

21:38.680 --> 21:41.800
..it's horrible watching her
connecting with everyone else and...

21:41.800 --> 21:43.920
..having special moments
with everyone else.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.760
Um...

21:45.760 --> 21:47.400
..yeah.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.280
Cute!

21:57.280 --> 21:58.720
This is nice.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.800
(LAUGHS)

22:00.800 --> 22:03.600
Would you like a glass?
I would love one. Thank you.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.480
I am so happy that I get
to hang out with Konrad tonight.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.000
OK.
(LAUGHS)

22:11.000 --> 22:13.080
Cheers.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.240
Cheers. To a big day.
(GLASSES CLINK)

22:15.240 --> 22:17.000
He's such a sweetheart,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.560
and he always makes me feel
so appreciated and validated.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.160
I loved today.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.160
You always get me all emotional.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.760
I'm captivated by him.

22:28.760 --> 22:35.120
And I know that I would be incredibly
lucky to have him by my side.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.320
Look how sexy you are.
Like, you're so extremely handsome.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.360
Thank you.

22:39.360 --> 22:42.040
But you're so open
with your emotions.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.320
(SIGHS)

22:45.320 --> 22:47.400
I just like you, Konrad.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
You do?
I do like you.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.920
Yeah.
That's good.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.920
Because...

22:51.920 --> 22:55.080
..I'm falling pretty hard and fast
for you, I'm not gonna lie.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.120
It's not easy to...

22:59.120 --> 23:01.040
..put your heart on the line and...

23:01.040 --> 23:03.000
..I want you to know that...

23:03.000 --> 23:06.240
..that forming a relationship
with someone means a lot to me.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.600
I'm only with someone
if I really think...

23:10.600 --> 23:13.360
Oh.
..there's a future with them.

23:15.680 --> 23:18.280
Do you see a future with me?

23:18.280 --> 23:19.360
Um...

23:19.360 --> 23:20.360
..I can.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.520
I absolutely can.
Yeah?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.200
Yeah.
Awesome.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.120
I just want to know
what it would look like.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.560
What would our relationship look like
on the outside?

23:29.560 --> 23:31.840
Um...

23:31.840 --> 23:34.960
..so, I did leave my job

23:34.960 --> 23:36.920
just before I came to the mansion.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.400
And...

23:40.400 --> 23:42.840
..I...

23:42.840 --> 23:44.800
..think I've realised that...

23:44.800 --> 23:46.760
..carpentry
wasn't really fulfilling me.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.120
So...

23:49.120 --> 23:51.640
..like, now...because, you know,

23:51.640 --> 23:53.560
I don't have a mortgage,
I don't have a family,

23:53.560 --> 23:57.720
I...I want to chase some stuff
that has real meaning for me.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.200
Well, I feel that.
I absolutely feel that.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.120
But...

24:02.120 --> 24:05.440
..I'm a very, like,
logical and a pretty real person.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.440
Yeah.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.240
So, for me, like...

24:08.240 --> 24:13.840
..I'm just trying to picture what
Konrad and Brooke's life looks like.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.880
So...

24:14.880 --> 24:16.600
Well, I don't think
chasing materialistic things

24:16.600 --> 24:18.800
is gonna give me
fulfilment and happiness, right?
Yeah.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.680
So...realistically, you know,
after this, if we were together,

24:22.680 --> 24:26.080
my main goal is to just...
you know, just...

24:26.080 --> 24:27.480
..find...

24:27.480 --> 24:29.360
..fulfilment.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.480
Doing what?

24:40.760 --> 24:44.440
Yeah, I don't know.
Come on, there's got to be something.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.800
Yeah, I don't know.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.360
But...

24:52.360 --> 24:55.520
..making other people happy
makes me really happy.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.160
So if I can use that
to generate an income...

25:00.200 --> 25:01.200
Mmm.
..awesome.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.440
I think that I can
get fulfilment that way.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.840
Yeah.

25:06.600 --> 25:10.320
There's a lot to unpack
from this conversation with Konrad.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.280
(LAUGHS)

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
Mmm.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.280
He is very free-spirited.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.120
And I've always loved that about him.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.920
But my brain's, like,
"What does he do for a job?" Like...

25:31.640 --> 25:34.240
It all kind of seems very airy-fairy,

25:34.240 --> 25:37.760
and...I'm a person that needs...

25:38.840 --> 25:40.720
..a little bit more stability.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.720
And it's just...
it's very conflicting.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.720
BROOKE: Today's a big one.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.480
It is the last single date
before hometowns, so...

26:08.480 --> 26:11.160
..there's a lot weighing on this one.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.360
I have established
some really strong connections,

26:13.360 --> 26:15.520
and I think, going into hometowns,

26:15.520 --> 26:19.680
it's really hard to sort of
compartmentalise where you're at.

26:19.680 --> 26:24.920
I'm putting everything into this.
Like, absolutely everything.

26:24.920 --> 26:29.000
And...I just really
want to get it right.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.560
Today, I'm having
my date with Darvid, and...

26:32.560 --> 26:36.880
..my first single date with Darvid
was a pretty crazy one.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.920
(BOTH LAUGH)

26:38.920 --> 26:40.960
OK.
Whoa!

26:40.960 --> 26:43.560
I'm gonna sit. Ready?
OK.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.000
This is...
Come down.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.520
Oh!
(LAUGHS)

26:48.520 --> 26:50.240
(BOTH LAUGH)

26:50.240 --> 26:51.960
But it was really beautiful.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.600
I don't really have, like,
a instant connection.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.800
I haven't had one, seriously,
for a long time.

26:58.800 --> 27:02.520
So it's kind of scary, but exciting,
that I feel that with you.

27:02.520 --> 27:06.000
I have a massive soft spot
for Darvid.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.200
We had a very strong connection
quite quickly.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.760
And it's been quite consistent
this whole time.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.280
Hello, handsome.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.960
Hello, stunner.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.640
Oh, I missed you.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.120
Hello. Mwah!

27:23.120 --> 27:25.200
Mmm!

27:25.200 --> 27:27.160
My first single date with Brooke
was...

27:27.160 --> 27:30.160
..absolutely amazing,
and I feel so lucky

27:30.160 --> 27:32.720
that I made that
connection straightaway with her.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.200
Oh, I missed you. Mmm.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.120
But a lot's happened since then.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.040
So...it's nice to be missed.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.160
I missed you.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.640
(LAUGHS)

27:45.640 --> 27:47.120
Mmm.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.640
I actually have to think today, OK?

27:48.640 --> 27:49.720
(LAUGHS)
Alright.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.920
Every time, you turn me to mush.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.920
Getting some time with
Brooke at this stage is priceless.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.120
So...I'm going to
really make every second count.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.880
Are you excited for today's date?
Yeah. I'm stoked.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.440
Yeah.
I feel really lucky.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.760
Really?
Yeah.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.000
Do you like wine?
Yeah, I love wine.
Yeah?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.280
It's good to know,
'cause I love wine.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.440
And...today, we're actually
gonna be making our own...

28:12.440 --> 28:13.560
Oh! (LAUGHS)
..blend. (LAUGHS)

28:13.560 --> 28:14.680
That's cool.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.400
Darvid's always been
a bit of a standout for me.

28:16.400 --> 28:20.880
Like, he did get that first date
and he has got the last date.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.160
But...

28:22.160 --> 28:24.320
..I want to know
so much more about him.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.840
You're turning me to mush again.
(LAUGHS)

28:25.840 --> 28:28.400
How do you do this to me?
I can't think.

28:28.400 --> 28:32.200
I kind of treat my relationships
like I do my wine.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.760
They should get better with age.
(LAUGHS)

28:43.600 --> 28:45.520
Oh, this is beautiful.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.680
So...

28:47.680 --> 28:49.720
..you know how I was telling you
about making our own blend?

28:49.720 --> 28:50.720
Mmm.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.720
We're, like...

28:51.720 --> 28:54.280
Actually physically gonna do it?
..physically gonna be mushing...

28:54.280 --> 28:57.560
OK. (LAUGHS) I can do that.
(LAUGHS) ..our own blend.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.240
I feel like Darvid just looks at me
and I turn to mush.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.600
(LAUGHS) So...

29:01.600 --> 29:04.080
..this should be easy for him.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.800
This is a lot of grapes to squish.
Jesus! Alright.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.800
Get in there.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.800
Thank you.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.840
Oh, my God.
Get in. (LAUGHS)

29:11.840 --> 29:15.120
I actually hate squishy things.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.320
Oh!
It's cold!

29:17.320 --> 29:20.080
Cold!
(LAUGHS) Are you ready?

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
Yep.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.400
Honestly, it's just nice
to spend some time with Brooke.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.720
Ah!

29:24.720 --> 29:26.640
Do you like the feeling?
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

29:26.640 --> 29:30.080
(GRAPES SQUISH)

29:30.080 --> 29:31.640
I'd do anything.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.880
How do you go with feet? (LAUGHS)

29:35.880 --> 29:40.640
Look. To get a good wine,
there is a bit of a process.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.920
Don't we...don't we go out?

29:42.920 --> 29:44.280
No.
No?

29:44.280 --> 29:46.560
(BOTH LAUGH)

29:46.560 --> 29:49.400
And sometimes you got to get
a little bit down and dirty.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.960
(LAUGHS) We're getting in there.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.280
Yes. You're really sinking,
aren't you?

29:54.280 --> 30:00.360
Things are starting to get really,
really weird, and giggly. (LAUGHS)

30:01.560 --> 30:03.160
I'm going deep.
(GRAPES SQUISH)

30:03.160 --> 30:05.480
Oh!
(BOTH LAUGH)

30:11.200 --> 30:13.960
This was much more romantic
in my head.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.480
It's still romantic.
Yeah.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.920
(BOTH LAUGH)

30:18.920 --> 30:20.320
Mmm.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.400
Each time I spend time with Brooke,

30:25.400 --> 30:28.040
I fall a little bit more for her.

30:32.240 --> 30:36.200
In this moment,
it's really hard to believe

30:36.200 --> 30:39.160
that Brooke has a connection
with anyone else.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.480
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

30:41.480 --> 30:43.600
Distracted.
Mmm.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.520
OK. I think we've done
a pretty good job.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.000
Yeah?

30:47.000 --> 30:50.360
I do have something to tell you.
(LAUGHS) Oh, no.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.000
Any wine connoisseur
probably would be looking at this...

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
OK.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.640
..and thinking, "Um...

30:55.640 --> 30:57.680
"..table grapes
don't actually make good wine."

30:57.680 --> 30:59.440
(BOTH LAUGH)
So...

30:59.440 --> 31:01.840
Really?
(LAUGHS) So...

31:01.840 --> 31:05.640
But it was, like, A for effort.
(LAUGHS)

31:05.640 --> 31:08.200
OK, I stitched him up, but...

31:08.200 --> 31:11.320
..it was an excuse
to get nice and close with him.

31:11.320 --> 31:14.160
And maybe see his feet.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.320
Ooh.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.800
(LAUGHS)

31:21.800 --> 31:23.840
Oh! Yum!

31:23.840 --> 31:27.000
I'm having so much fun
on this date with Darvid.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Oh, I've definitely
poured mine a bit more than yours.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.200
That's alright.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.400
You want a bit more? You all good?
Yeah, little top-up.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.080
Yeah? A little top-up?

31:34.080 --> 31:35.880
(LAUGHS)
OK.

31:35.880 --> 31:40.480
He's the perfect blend
of sexy and playful...

31:40.480 --> 31:42.560
..but serious.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.040
BOTH: Cheers.
(GLASSES CLINK)

31:44.040 --> 31:45.160
Mmm.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.440
Oh!
Mmm.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.400
That's really nice.
Yep.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.960
I love that we don't
take ourselves too seriously.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.680
(LAUGHS)

31:59.120 --> 32:02.640
But when we need to,
we get down to business.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.240
I do have some questions.
OK.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.080
I've been meaning
to ask you them, but, like,

32:07.080 --> 32:09.760
we have such a consistent,
like, relationship...

32:09.760 --> 32:10.800
Mm-hm.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.520
..that I kind of
didn't want to know the answers.

32:12.520 --> 32:13.960
OK.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.800
This is what I do
when things are, like, really good...
Mm-hm.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.640
..and, like...
I don't want to, like...

32:18.640 --> 32:19.800
..I don't know.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.640
It's, like, I stray away from...

32:22.640 --> 32:24.360
The tough questions?
Yeah.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.560
The things
that I kind of need to know.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.840
Mmm.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.840
Are you a long-term kind of guy?

32:32.280 --> 32:33.800
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.720
I just want to grow with someone.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.480
Cute.
(LAUGHS)

32:40.480 --> 32:42.200
Corny, but I love it.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.200
That's...
That's very cute.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.280
..what I think about - like...

32:46.280 --> 32:47.840
..I'm not looking for a...

32:47.840 --> 32:48.920
..quick fling.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.200
OK.
At all.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.440
What about you?

32:52.440 --> 32:53.440
Um...

32:54.760 --> 32:57.920
..I'm definitely not looking for,
like, a little quick fling

32:57.920 --> 33:01.120
or something that's, like,
seems temporary.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.840
Yeah.
Like...yeah.

33:02.840 --> 33:03.920
Like, long story short is, like,

33:03.920 --> 33:06.080
a lot of people
have come in and out of my life,

33:06.080 --> 33:08.200
and I haven't had...

33:08.200 --> 33:09.560
..the one person...

33:09.560 --> 33:12.560
..that's been consistent
in my life, like, from birth.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.840
Like, you know, most people
have, like, their mum and dad.

33:15.840 --> 33:19.400
I hadn't had that, so, like...

33:19.400 --> 33:24.880
..that's why I'm here - to find
that long-term unconditional love.

33:24.880 --> 33:28.520
My childhood was a bit different
to most childhoods.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.280
I didn't have a lot of stability.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.600
I bounced from home to home.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.240
And that definitely left
a lot of scars.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.680
Oh, God.
Now this is bringing up some stuff.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.920
Um...
Hit me.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.480
I find it really hard to, um...

33:46.600 --> 33:49.000
..let...go...

33:49.000 --> 33:50.720
..in relationships...

33:50.720 --> 33:52.040
Mm-hm.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.520
..'cause I'm always,
like, preparing that.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.240
Oh, my God.
Oh.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.720
(BLEEP)

33:56.720 --> 33:58.760
Got me good.
(LAUGHS)

34:00.120 --> 34:01.880
Yeah, wow.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.720
(SIGHS)

34:04.720 --> 34:06.720
You know, as I'm always prepared
that someone's gonna say

34:06.720 --> 34:09.240
that they don't love me enough
or...or, like...

34:09.240 --> 34:11.120
..I'm not enough.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.320
That's my biggest...

34:13.320 --> 34:14.640
Yep.
(SNIFFLES)

34:14.640 --> 34:16.320
Thank you.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.800
I don't think that's...

34:21.040 --> 34:23.480
(SIGHS)

34:25.640 --> 34:28.640
..I don't think that's something
you should be worried about at all.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.000
I feel really touched that

34:33.000 --> 34:36.080
Brooke's
really opening up to me, but...

34:36.080 --> 34:38.280
..that's really hard to hear,
to be honest.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.160
Sorry for crying.
Oh, don't be sorry.

34:41.160 --> 34:42.880
It's nice. You're real.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.320
Brooke to me
is just a ray of sunshine.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.360
Honestly, she's so lovable.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.880
And I just want her to feel...

34:49.880 --> 34:52.080
..feel that.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.520
I think...

34:53.520 --> 34:56.080
..you're a beautiful person, and...

34:56.080 --> 34:57.640
..I felt something
really special with you

34:57.640 --> 34:59.640
from the beginning, I really did.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.120
And it's...

35:02.120 --> 35:05.920
..I feel very vulnerable
at the moment, because...

35:05.920 --> 35:08.760
..I usually wouldn't just, like...

35:08.760 --> 35:11.960
..open up my heart to someone
so quickly.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.160
But, like, I'm all-in.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.000
And I don't say that lightly.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.240
I...I don't think
I've ever said that to someone.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.720
Really?

35:24.720 --> 35:25.800
Yeah.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.600
Mmm.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.240
I would absolutely love to be

35:47.240 --> 35:50.080
that consistent person
in Brooke's life.

36:02.960 --> 36:08.840
OSHER:
Book a date with The Bachelorette

36:16.560 --> 36:18.760
Here we are, hey?
I know, mate.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.320
Top six.
Top six. Cheers.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.680
Maybe top five
if Darv doesn't come back.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.640
Well, hopefully, he doesn't.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.520
(LAUGHS)

36:25.520 --> 36:27.240
(BOTH LAUGH)

36:27.240 --> 36:29.480
Well, let's be honest.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.120
I think there's definitely
two people going home tonight.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.800
And...it's scary,
because I am so invested.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.840
I have been since day one.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.840
I just am in awe of her.
I think we all are.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.760
Absolutely.
Yeah.

36:45.080 --> 36:49.160
This is the last cocktail party
before hometowns, and...

36:49.160 --> 36:51.360
..every person
standing here tonight...

36:52.680 --> 36:56.240
(LAUGHS)
..has serious feelings for Brooke,

36:56.240 --> 37:00.200
and...I feel like two people
are going to be heartbroken.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.720
I just hope that that's not me.

37:05.280 --> 37:09.800
Oh, how are you guys feeling
going into tonight's rose ceremony?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.040
Yeah, no, look,
I'm definitely feeling nervous.

37:12.040 --> 37:15.520
I usually head into a cocktail party

37:15.520 --> 37:20.600
with a pretty good idea
of who might be leaving, and...

37:20.600 --> 37:24.040
..I have no idea tonight,
and it's...

37:24.040 --> 37:27.200
..scary as heck.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.440
Here they are.
Oh, wow.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.920
Hi.
How you doing?
Hello, hello.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.800
I'm going into tonight's cocktail
party with a bit of an agenda.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.080
You guys look amazing. How are you?
Good. How are you?

37:44.080 --> 37:45.600
I'm good.

37:45.600 --> 37:49.040
I have some really serious questions
that I need answered.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.280
I'm gonna take Jamie-Lee
straightaway.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.040
I will see you guys very soon.
(LAUGHS)

37:53.040 --> 37:54.760
You ready?
Always.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.400
You look amazing.
I know. Back at ya.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.280
BROOKE: There is no time
for small talk tonight.

38:00.280 --> 38:03.000
This cocktail party
is gonna be extremely intense.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.080
Hello. You right?

38:04.080 --> 38:05.200
Yes.
Yeah?

38:05.200 --> 38:06.360
How are you?
Yeah, I'm good.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.680
Yeah?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.520
I'm head over.
I know.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.720
I thought...I thought you might have
maybe even said the L-word today.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.280
No. No, no, no.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.080
I think out of everyone
left in the mansion,

38:18.080 --> 38:21.320
Darvid
is my biggest contender right now.

38:21.320 --> 38:22.800
We had a laugh at the start,
and then...

38:22.800 --> 38:26.240
..the...sit-down
was, like, quite serious.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.720
And, like...

38:27.720 --> 38:31.120
..and, like, she opened up a bit,
which is nice.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.520
Yeah.

38:35.640 --> 38:36.920
But...

38:36.920 --> 38:38.680
(BLEEP)

38:38.680 --> 38:41.800
(LAUGHS)
Oh, look at you.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.200
I'm in trouble.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.920
You've fallen in love, babe.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.200
(LAUGHS)

38:48.200 --> 38:51.520
I can really feel the genuine love

38:51.520 --> 38:56.440
that is growing for her in him,
and...

38:56.440 --> 38:59.600
..yeah, it's making me
second-guess myself.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.280
OK, breaking down the final six,
you get Darv.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.600
Smooth operator, easy talker.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.920
Silver-tongued devil.
Silver-tongued devil.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.200
(LAUGHS)

39:12.200 --> 39:15.600
I think with Darvid after he got the
first impressions rose, first date,

39:15.600 --> 39:17.480
and now this final single date,

39:17.480 --> 39:19.120
I felt like he was
always gonna be in the top six.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.520
You know?
Mmm. Mmm.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.640
I've always thought
they had a really strong connection.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.880
He's definitely always been
a frontrunner for me.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.280
KURT: Here you got Holly.

39:27.280 --> 39:31.680
Holly...you know, she's out there.
She's funny. She's beautiful.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.800
I can't really fault her really.
I don't know her.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.200
I've seen the way Holly and
Brooke look at each other, and...

39:37.200 --> 39:39.680
..yeah, like,
it's powerful stuff, and...

39:39.680 --> 39:44.480
..yeah, it's just...it looks like
they got a mad connection.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.640
Again, I think
she's always been a frontrunner.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.720
My bet at the moment
is Holly and...and Darv are...

39:49.720 --> 39:51.280
..are getting a rose tonight

39:51.280 --> 39:54.480
and the rest of us
are in trouble, I think.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.120
Millie...

39:56.120 --> 39:59.120
She's, you know, got a lot of things
in common with Brooke.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.680
Yeah.
So you'd have to think that...
She's a contender?

40:01.680 --> 40:02.680
You'd have to, yeah.
Yeah.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.720
You'd have to. I guess the age
is the only question mark.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.280
(INAUDIBLE)

40:06.280 --> 40:07.520
With Jamie-Lee, I...

40:07.520 --> 40:08.600
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing?

40:08.600 --> 40:09.840
Good. How are you?
You look stunning.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.000
Yeah.
Thanks.
Really terrific.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.840
But they were both
on the Honey Badger's season. So...

40:12.840 --> 40:15.040
I suppose the other question mark
on it is...

40:15.040 --> 40:17.040
..you know, it took three years.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.520
KONRAD: Yeah. Why?

40:18.520 --> 40:22.080
I know timing is everything
in a relationship, but...

40:24.160 --> 40:25.320
..why didn't she do it sooner?

40:25.320 --> 40:27.000
Yeah. Yeah.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I don't know.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.120
And...
Mmm.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.520
..who else have we got?

40:31.520 --> 40:32.760
You and I.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.120
You and I, mate.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.480
Well, I think
you're a pretty good bloke.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.320
Mate, I think you're a stunner.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.400
Oh, shit.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.680
This could be anyone
going home tonight, hey?

40:40.680 --> 40:41.800
Yeah.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.920
Here she is.
And here she comes.

40:47.920 --> 40:51.120
I'm hoping
she's gonna come for one of us.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.280
Is your heart racing?

40:52.280 --> 40:55.200
Yeah. Is yours?
My heart's racing. Yeah.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.200
Hello, my handsome men. How are you?
Hello.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.240
Good. How you doing?
(SIGHS) Good, good, good.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.720
How's things?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.440
Konrad, can I steal you?
Oh! Of course you can.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.000
Yeah?
Leaving me alone again?

41:05.000 --> 41:08.080
(BOTH LAUGH)
I'll be back, brother.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.720
I thought we could go
to the love seat, our favourite spot.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.720
Sure. Sounds good.

41:21.760 --> 41:25.520
I'm feeling really anxious
about this chat with Konrad.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.760
Do you want me to get you a cushion?

41:26.760 --> 41:28.360
Um...yeah, quickly.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.880
Our connection
has always been strong, but...

41:31.880 --> 41:35.000
..there's just so many unknowns
with him, and...

41:35.000 --> 41:39.040
..I need some clarity
on what our future looks like.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.720
How are you?
I'm good.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.800
That's good.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.840
Yeah.

41:43.840 --> 41:47.480
Because right now,
I'm struggling to picture it.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.640
I kind of got lost the last...

41:49.640 --> 41:51.920
..conversation we had
in our extended time,

41:51.920 --> 41:54.680
when you asked about the future,
what it would look like with me.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.920
And...

41:55.920 --> 41:59.720
..there's just a couple little
things that I want to clear up.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.440
I think a future with me
would be, like, you know,

42:01.440 --> 42:03.880
we get up early,
we go for runs, or...

42:03.880 --> 42:06.320
Yeah.
..if you wanted to sleep in,
I'd have your coffee ready for you.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.040
'Cause I'm up at 4:35.

42:08.040 --> 42:09.840
But I won't wake you.
I'll just get your coffee.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.000
Cute. I like it.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.440
And then, um...

42:12.440 --> 42:14.160
..I'd make
a good breakfast burrito...

42:14.160 --> 42:15.480
Yum!

42:15.480 --> 42:17.360
..and then walk the dogs
and kick a footy or...

42:17.360 --> 42:18.360
Mmm.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.800
..or just stay in bed
if it's raining,

42:19.800 --> 42:21.960
'cause Melbourne
gets pretty cold and wet.

42:21.960 --> 42:24.560
So this is on our weekends?
This...like, yeah.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.880
Yeah, yeah.
(LAUGHS)

42:25.880 --> 42:29.520
Well, I mean...
ideally every day, right? (LAUGHS)

42:29.520 --> 42:31.240
(LAUGHS)
I wish I could do that every day.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.440
Yeah.
It would be really amazing
if I could do that every day.

42:33.440 --> 42:37.840
But, like...I, like,
go straight back into, like,

42:37.840 --> 42:41.040
hardcore, like, intense work,
and, like, I know

42:41.040 --> 42:42.880
that you're in bit of a limbo
at the moment,

42:42.880 --> 42:44.560
and I just want to know, like...

42:46.720 --> 42:49.000
..where does that go long-term?

42:51.480 --> 42:52.920
For me, it just feels like Konrad's

42:52.920 --> 42:55.880
kind of glamourising
what our life would be like,

42:55.880 --> 42:58.800
rather than being, like, realistic.

42:58.800 --> 43:04.480
Look, I...I don't know
what I'm gonna do after this, but...

43:04.480 --> 43:07.080
..I'm super-goal-driven
and I'm super-ambitious.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.120
Mmm.

43:08.120 --> 43:09.920
And...

43:09.920 --> 43:11.080
..I think...

43:11.080 --> 43:12.760
..you know,
without sounding cocky and whatever,

43:12.760 --> 43:15.120
I feel like
I'm gonna be super-successful.

43:16.840 --> 43:21.880
It's great to be optimistic,
but you also have to be quite...real.

43:21.880 --> 43:25.840
Look, I've come into this not hiding
anything and being brutally honest.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.080
Yeah.

43:27.080 --> 43:30.160
And I think there's
still time for me to look for

43:30.160 --> 43:34.400
things I'm still passionate about,
other things that aren't carpentry.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.640
And I feel like
you support me in that.

43:36.640 --> 43:40.160
At the end of the day, like,
I want you to know that

43:40.160 --> 43:41.720
I'm falling
pretty hard and fast for you.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.640
And...

43:43.640 --> 43:44.640
..no-one's perfect.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.760
Mmm.
And you have to realise that.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.440
I know no-one's perfect,

43:50.440 --> 43:53.320
but I'm trying to find someone
who's perfect for me.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.720
Yeah. Wow.
(BOTH LAUGH)

43:55.720 --> 43:58.280
Where? Where do I go from there?
I don't know.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.280
I hope I answered it correctly.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.960
I know it's hard, like...

44:02.960 --> 44:04.960
..but...yeah.

44:23.360 --> 44:27.520
HOLLY: It's really hard
going into this rose ceremony.

44:27.520 --> 44:31.760
Seeing everyone's connection
with Brooke has really thrown me.

44:31.760 --> 44:36.320
And I'm feeling pretty rattled.

44:36.320 --> 44:40.760
Every person standing here tonight
has serious feelings for Brooke.

44:40.760 --> 44:46.840
We're all crazily invested and
we could all see a future with her.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.080
MILLIE: Getting to hometowns
obviously means so much.

44:51.080 --> 44:55.760
I have so much more that I want
to show of myself to Brooke.

44:55.760 --> 45:01.320
And introducing your partner
to your family is a big deal.

45:01.320 --> 45:04.880
I am very aware of what's at stake.

45:10.680 --> 45:13.880
Good evening, ladies.
Good evening, gentlemen.

45:15.800 --> 45:18.320
You must be feeling the pressure
about making it to hometowns.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.200
Introducing a potential partner

45:22.200 --> 45:24.440
to the people in your life
that mean the most to you

45:24.440 --> 45:27.160
is a huge step in any relationship.

45:27.160 --> 45:31.240
Unfortunately, only four of you
will get that chance.

45:33.480 --> 45:37.160
I'm sorry to say that two of you will
be leaving the mansion this evening.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.360
Good luck to all of you.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.840
Here's Brooke.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.320
KONRAD: It would mean so much to me
to make it to hometowns.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.600
I feel my family and my friends
are the...

45:53.600 --> 45:56.800
..sort of the last piece of
the puzzle that Brooke needs to see.

46:00.400 --> 46:04.240
KURT: Tonight is so important
to get a rose.

46:07.080 --> 46:10.000
I've had a lot of intimate moments,
and you can't help but think

46:10.000 --> 46:13.840
that the connection's getting
stronger and stronger and stronger,

46:13.840 --> 46:16.640
and I feel
if I can get to hometowns,

46:16.640 --> 46:19.480
anything can happen.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.360
Jamie-Lee.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.400
Jamie-Lee,
will you accept this rose?

46:27.400 --> 46:30.000
Absolutely. Thank you.

46:48.080 --> 46:50.000
Darvid.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.360
Darvid, will you accept this rose?

46:57.360 --> 46:59.080
Of course.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.520
Holly.

47:50.840 --> 47:52.880
Konrad.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.320
Konrad, will you accept this rose?

48:01.320 --> 48:03.400
Of course. Thank you.

48:19.040 --> 48:21.120
Millie and Kurt.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.800
I'm sorry,
but you did not receive a rose.

48:24.800 --> 48:28.480
Could you take the time now
to please say goodbye?

You're an amazingly beautiful girl.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.920
Yeah.

49:22.920 --> 49:25.040
See you later, guys.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.520
Thank you, Kurt.
I...like, I'm so sorry that...

49:32.520 --> 49:34.320
No, don't...why are you sorry?
Don't be sorry.

49:34.320 --> 49:37.920
It just didn't work out between us,
and that's alright.

49:37.920 --> 49:39.920
Like, I trust you. You're
gonna make the right decision.

49:39.920 --> 49:42.920
There's some, yeah,
awesome people, and...

49:42.920 --> 49:45.720
..I wish it was me, but, hey, we can
still be friends on the outside.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.440
That's really big of you.

Someone there's
gonna make you real happy.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.480
(LAUGHS)
Alright.
Alright.

49:51.480 --> 49:54.400
Bye, Kurt.
See ya later. Oh!

49:54.400 --> 49:56.160
(LAUGHS)
But, um...yeah.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.920
I'll see you soon.

49:57.920 --> 50:01.760
Well, maybe.
Catch up for a coffee or something.

Alright.

50:03.520 --> 50:06.120
See you, Brooke.
I'll talk to you later. Well, maybe.

50:17.480 --> 50:20.480
KURT: I came to the mansion
to get to know Brooke.

50:22.280 --> 50:23.800
I think she's a beautiful girl
inside and out,

50:23.800 --> 50:27.360
and she has so many qualities
that I look for in a partner, and...

50:27.360 --> 50:31.720
..I kind of wish I just
backed myself a little bit more.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.280
I think that's something

50:33.280 --> 50:36.240
that's gonna eat away at me
a little bit, but, um...

50:36.240 --> 50:40.480
..I'm not gonna blame anyone else,
I'm gonna blame myself.

50:50.040 --> 50:51.960

Next on The Bachelorette...

50:53.360 --> 50:55.200
I'm gonna just fix my hair.

It's fine, Dad.

50:56.400 --> 50:58.640
..Brooke faces hometowns...

50:58.640 --> 51:00.280

come out firing.

there's so much more uncertainty

about our future, and the pressure's
kind of getting to me.

51:24.480 --> 51:27.360
..an unexpected revelation...

51:27.360 --> 51:30.400
That's a big deal, because
that's not gonna be compatible.

52:16.320 --> 52:20.000
Because this week
is really important to me.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.920
I've got
some really strong connections

52:21.920 --> 52:24.600
with Jamie-Lee, Holly,
Konrad and Darvid,

52:24.600 --> 52:27.640
and these are my potential partners.

52:27.640 --> 52:31.080
Like, I've got to figure out
who the person is

52:31.080 --> 52:33.000
that's going to be
the love of my life.

52:35.160 --> 52:40.320
I finally get to see
that last little piece of the puzzle

52:40.320 --> 52:42.400
of what the relationship
would be like.

52:42.400 --> 52:45.240
But, unfortunately,
with circumstance,

52:45.240 --> 52:48.560
not everyone
will be here in person this year,

52:48.560 --> 52:51.840
but I'll still be meeting
all of the family and friends.

52:51.840 --> 52:55.400
And, boy, oh, boy,
I am extremely nervous

52:55.400 --> 52:58.320
for the grillings
that I'm gonna be getting.

52:58.320 --> 53:02.800

people are gonna be easy on me.

53:14.840 --> 53:17.360

Today, Brooke's meeting my family.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.480
Unfortunately, I can't
get to Melbourne at the moment,

53:20.480 --> 53:22.560
so we'll be doing a video call.

53:22.560 --> 53:25.800
If Brooke hits it off with my family
and they love her,

53:25.800 --> 53:28.920
it's only going to intensify
the feelings I already have,

53:28.920 --> 53:30.920
and I'm gonna lose it -
I'm gonna be head over heels.

53:30.920 --> 53:34.960
Like, the L-word could be coming.
It really could.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.160
BROOKE: Konrad has been probably
the most open and honest guy

53:40.160 --> 53:42.320
I have met in a very long time,

53:42.320 --> 53:47.800
and the attraction is very intense
when I'm with Konrad.

53:47.800 --> 53:51.600
But the last time we spoke, I did
have some really serious questions.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.400
Konrad is
a go-with-the-flow kind of guy

53:54.400 --> 53:58.000
and he doesn't have, like, this
really strict direction in his life,

53:58.000 --> 54:03.040
and I need a bit of stability and
a bit of security within a partner,

54:03.040 --> 54:05.840
because I didn't have
a lot of stability growing up,

54:05.840 --> 54:09.440
so I'm hoping, like, today
that I can get more clarity

54:09.440 --> 54:13.360
of what our relationship
could look like.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.520
Hi.
Hey!

54:15.520 --> 54:16.760
Hey.
You look beautiful.

54:16.760 --> 54:18.280
I missed you.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.400
Ooh!

54:19.400 --> 54:21.800
We got the place to ourselves today.
I know.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.080

whatever we want.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.680

Should we get comfy on the couch?
Yeah.

KONRAD: Every time I see Brooke,
I'm speechless.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.560
Uh...she does take my breath away.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.200
I turn into, like,
a little schoolkid or something.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.040
What have you been up to?
(SIGHS) You know.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.640

pretty much.

I'm missing you, though.

54:40.320 --> 54:42.680
I've missed you.

54:42.680 --> 54:46.240
I get excited every time I see her.
She's...she's definitely a presence.

54:46.240 --> 54:49.480
You know, at this point,
I feel like you know most of me

54:49.480 --> 54:52.320
and the missing piece
is sort of my family, so...

54:52.320 --> 54:54.560
..you're gonna meet, uh, my
mum and my dad, so Roger and Ella.

54:54.560 --> 54:55.720
Oh, my God.
They're cool.

You're alright. Don't worry.
Mmm.

54:58.600 --> 55:02.240
Dad definitely is very much like me.
I think I get my humour from my dad.

55:02.240 --> 55:04.120
And you'll meet my brother, Charlie.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.320
I'm meeting the whole gang today.
Yeah, you're meeting the gang.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.360
Yeah. (LAUGHS)
Wow.
The fam-bam.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.520
They're beautiful people.

55:09.520 --> 55:12.560
And I got, like, a really solid
safety net of just love and...

55:12.560 --> 55:14.360
..and...it's...it's cool,

55:14.360 --> 55:16.440
but they've seen me
go through heartbreak,

55:16.440 --> 55:19.200
so they're very protective of me.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.400
OK. Ooh!

55:20.400 --> 55:22.000
Ooh, I just got nervous.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.120
Did ya?
I don't have parents, so, like...

55:24.120 --> 55:26.880
OK.
..meeting the parents is a big deal.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.320
But I know how much they mean to you,

55:28.320 --> 55:30.280
so I'm excited
to, like, meet them and...

55:30.280 --> 55:32.200
Any advice?
Any advice? Be yourself.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.800
Be myself?
Be yourself.
OK.

55:33.800 --> 55:35.600
You're a beautiful girl -
you know, you're amazing...

55:35.600 --> 55:37.080
Thank you.
..outside and inside.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.720
You know I think that of you.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.840
So if you just show them yourself,
be yourself...

55:40.840 --> 55:43.200
OK.
..it'll go awesome.

55:43.200 --> 55:45.160
Alright.

55:45.160 --> 55:48.080
Meeting Konrad's parents today
is a little bit daunting,

55:48.080 --> 55:52.960
but I do feel very honoured
and very lucky to get to meet them.

55:52.960 --> 55:58.440
He has spoken so highly about them,
so I'd be really interested to see

55:58.440 --> 56:00.520
who has made him the way that he is.

56:33.520 --> 56:35.360
Let me introduce you all to Brooke.

56:35.360 --> 56:37.320
I'm gonna find my glasses.
They're here somewhere.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.840
I've lost 'em.

56:41.200 --> 56:43.440
Oh, look, I'll leave it.
Forget the glasses.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.040
I'll focus.

56:45.040 --> 56:47.040
Dad, this is Brooke.

..in a sort of out-of-focus fashion.

56:57.840 --> 57:01.000
Look, Dad is just so excited.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.800
(LAUGHS)
I'm getting my glasses. Hang on.

57:03.800 --> 57:06.000
What is this crazy old man doing?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.720
Oh! There you are.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.440
(LAUGHS)
Oh, you're gorgeous, Brooke.

57:09.440 --> 57:10.600
Look at you!

57:10.600 --> 57:12.800
You can see
where I get the craziness from now.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.760
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

57:14.760 --> 57:16.640
I got to apologise
for not combing my hair.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.920
That's alright.

57:17.920 --> 57:21.000
Dad's so self-conscious.
He's been super-nervous.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.240
(LAUGHS)

57:22.240 --> 57:26.880
Oh, man! There's no facade with
my family. They are who they are.

57:26.880 --> 57:28.200
They don't hide anything.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.640
I'm just a wacky guy.
I can't help it.

57:30.640 --> 57:34.520
My family. Meet my family.
Oh, you guys are so lovely.

57:34.520 --> 57:37.400
KONRAD: So seeing Brooke laughing
with my family at this point,

57:37.400 --> 57:39.520
it's a relief - feel like
she's embracing it, you know.

57:39.520 --> 57:42.520
She thinks they're funny,
which is always a good start.

57:42.520 --> 57:45.200
I might excuse myself, Brooke,

57:45.200 --> 57:46.840
and, uh, leave you with Mum and Dad.

57:46.840 --> 57:48.120
Alright? Alright.

57:48.120 --> 57:50.640
OK.
Be...you'll be fine.

57:50.640 --> 57:54.840
Oh, my gosh! Konrad's family
is absolutely hilarious.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.560
They're open, there's no filter,

57:57.560 --> 57:59.440
and you can understand why
in a split second

57:59.440 --> 58:01.680
why Konrad is the way that he is.

58:01.680 --> 58:04.480
But I'm extremely nervous right now,

58:04.480 --> 58:08.520
because you never know how a chat
with a potential partner's parents

58:08.520 --> 58:10.200
is going to go.

58:10.200 --> 58:15.160
Now that he's left the room, can
I ask you some questions about him

58:15.160 --> 58:17.040
and your feelings towards him?

58:17.040 --> 58:18.480
Yeah. Go for it.

58:18.480 --> 58:20.160
Do you see yourself

58:20.160 --> 58:25.080
in a serious-type relationship
with Mr Sensitive?

58:25.080 --> 58:27.200
'Cause he is a sensitive guy.

58:27.200 --> 58:29.280
Well, we ARE doing hometowns,
and I think...

58:29.280 --> 58:33.000
..I've got down to
four strong connections,

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
and Konrad has been
one of the strongest from the start

58:37.000 --> 58:39.160
and is still now.

58:39.160 --> 58:41.760
He is sensitive, I do see that,

58:41.760 --> 58:44.600
but I think there's
a real beautiful thing with Konrad.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.920
Like, he's so vulnerable
with his feelings.

58:46.920 --> 58:51.040
And I think I've probably
not particularly dated guys

58:51.040 --> 58:53.840
that have been really honest
about how they're feeling

58:53.840 --> 58:57.040
and communicate that with me,
so it's really refreshing,

58:57.040 --> 59:00.240
and I think that's why
I'm drawn to him so much.

59:00.240 --> 59:05.320
He was in quite a long relationship,
and he has been, um...

59:05.320 --> 59:06.760
..hurt.

59:06.760 --> 59:10.200
It hurt him horribly.

59:10.200 --> 59:11.920
And...

59:16.960 --> 59:20.920
..he put so much
into that previous relationship,

59:20.920 --> 59:23.760
and it...it was blown out of
the water, and I mean seriously.

59:23.760 --> 59:26.160
He...he chucked
his whole heart and soul into it.

59:26.160 --> 59:28.480
And...

59:28.480 --> 59:29.840
Sorry.

59:29.840 --> 59:32.600
He got his teary stuff off me,
I think,

59:32.600 --> 59:35.960
but I felt so sorry for him.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.000
(SNIFFLES)

59:40.440 --> 59:41.920
Sorry. Dear.

59:41.920 --> 59:45.400
Kooky and stupid, his father is.

59:45.400 --> 59:47.840
But...
Yeah, alright, Rog. OK.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.920
I made a bow tie.

59:49.920 --> 59:53.640
(LAUGHS)

59:53.640 --> 59:55.440
Anyway, um...

59:55.440 --> 59:57.320
..what I'm trying to say is...

59:57.320 --> 59:59.360
..he...he's a wonderful man.

59:59.360 --> 1:00:01.240
He'd be a great catch.

1:00:01.240 --> 1:00:03.440
I love him to death.

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:06.400
I would do anything for my son.

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:09.440
(SNIFFLES) I really would.

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.840
(LAUGHS)

1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:17.120
Ooh.

1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:22.280
I feel very emotional seeing
his parents get so upset about...

1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:24.440
..anyone that's previously hurt him.

1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:28.240
In this situation,
I do have three other connections.

1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:31.120
Altogether, I have four
strong connections and relationships

1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:32.760
that I see in my future.

1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.560
Konrad is one of them.

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:38.680
It absolutely does weigh heavily on
me, because I don't want to hurt him.

1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:40.440
I'm...yeah.

1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:43.040
(SIGHS) I feel like...

1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:45.040
It's hard. It's really hard.

1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:50.920
I've enjoyed today.

1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:53.760
It has been an absolute pleasure
meeting you guys.

1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:57.240
I know it's very unusual over...
(LAUGHS) ..a video chat,

1:00:57.240 --> 1:00:59.680
and I would have loved
to have met you in person

1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:01.520
and given you a big hug.

1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:03.840
It's been fantastic.
Brooke, we love you.

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:05.680
We think you're absolutely gorgeous,

1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:08.320
and we'd love for you
to be part of our family.

1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:09.800
Konrad can go somewhere el...

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:11.280
No.
(BOTH LAUGH)
It's not true.

1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:13.560
Um... (LAUGHS)

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.400
Stop it!

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:17.640
Anyway -
point I'm trying to make is...

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:20.200
(US ACCENT)
..don't break my baby's heart.

1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:22.120
And I mean that.
You know what I'm saying?

1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:25.560
So lovely...
Love you guys. Love you so much.
Love you guys.

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:27.200
Thank you.
Love you guys!

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:28.760
Thank you.
Love you.

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:29.760
Bye.
See you soon.

1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:31.920
BROOKE: Sad to see them go.
Love you too.

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.440
(BOTH LAUGH)

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:35.960
I couldn't have asked
for a better hometown.

1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:37.880
I think it's pretty clear,
I think it's pretty evident,

1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:40.000
that Mum and Dad, they love Brooke,

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000
and I think seeing her get along
with my family so well,

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.880
it's taken it
sort of to the next level for me.

1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:48.440
I want to be with her
at the end of this.

1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:50.040
Today, lovely to see you.

1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:52.640
Yeah, it's been awesome.
It's been so good. (LAUGHS)

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:54.800
I had a really fun day.
I hope you did too.

1:01:54.800 --> 1:01:58.320
Yeah.
Got to see
the final piece of the puzzle of me.

1:01:58.320 --> 1:01:59.880
I want to say, like, I've enjoyed...

1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:01.640
Did you?
..spending time with your family.

1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:02.920
For sure.

1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:07.320
I'm glad that they liked you
and saw what I see in you as well.

1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:08.600
It's, um...you know, it's crazy.

1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:10.080
I guess...

1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:12.320
..with the way
it's been progressing so naturally,

1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:15.560
the connection's been growing, you
know, stronger and stronger for me

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:17.880
and...I definitely...you know,

1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:19.640
I'm definitely
falling in love with you, Brooke.

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:23.040
It's...this is serious. It's real.

1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:28.120
Wait. Can you say that again?
Definitely falling in love with you.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:29.120
(KISSES)
(LAUGHS)

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:31.520
Beautiful. Crazy.

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:35.440
KONRAD: I guess this is
the most vulnerable I've felt

1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:37.200
throughout this whole process.

1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:38.800
And I've done all I could.

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:41.400
I've given her all of me, and...
and I couldn't do any more.

1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:43.000
I'm not gonna be able
to sleep tonight.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.080
(LAUGHS)

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:47.840
I'm just gonna be
thinking about you and today.

1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:51.520
All I can do now
is hope for the best.

1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:53.720
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

1:02:53.720 --> 1:02:56.360
Mmm. OK.

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.560
BROOKE:
This hometown has been so good.

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:02.840
Like, seeing...

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:07.800
..Konrad and the way that he is
from his family has been amazing.

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:11.800
I massively care for him. I care
about him with every inch of my soul.

1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:14.600
Like, I think he's so beautiful.

1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:17.360
He is what I'm looking for.

1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:21.520
But I feel like there's so much
more uncertainty about our future.

1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:27.560
And Konrad's family don't want to see
their son and their brother get hurt.

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.760
It does feel
a little bit more risky with him,

1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:33.440
because I know that he's
not hugely assured in his own life,

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:35.720
like, very airy-fairy.

1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:42.280
So a lot is weighing heavily
on my heart and in my head,

1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:44.960
and the pressure's
kind of getting to me.

1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:06.800
BROOKE: Today is my second hometown,
meeting Jamie-Lee's loved ones,

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:09.200
and I feel really excited.

1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:12.880
I know that...

1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:14.680
..Jamie-Lee and I's relationship

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:17.800
has always felt like
a sliding door moment,

1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:20.520
but now we've been given
this opportunity

1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:22.040
to have our own love story.

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:24.960
JAMIE-LEE:
When I started all of this,

1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:28.720
I just didn't know if I would have
made it out of the friend zone.

1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.560
And to get this far, it's kind of,
like, validation that Brooke sees

1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:35.280
a serious future with me.

1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:36.880
Hi!
Hi.

1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:38.360
(BOTH LAUGH)

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:39.720
How are you?
You look beautiful.
Oh, wow.

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:40.920
Hello.
Hey, babe.

1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:43.600
And I'm definitely
falling in love with her.

1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:46.000
I'm...head over heels for her.

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.560
Cheers.
Cheers.

1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:50.600
JAMIE-LEE: And I'm just hopeful
that today goes well.

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:54.440
Because I could
potentially see myself

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:57.640
saying the L-word.

1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:02.280
So, today, you'll be meeting
two of my closest friends, Dee...

1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:03.560
Yep.
..and Monique.

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:06.920
Who do you think is gonna be
the one that I need to impress?

1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:10.440
Um, I think Dee will definitely
have some questions for you.

1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:13.680
She's been by my side for, like,
you know, 9 or 10 years.

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:16.000
She's seen
the Jamie that's gone through

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:18.440
the beginning of relationships
and the end of relationships.

1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:20.760
She wants to make sure that...

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:22.480
..you know, we both want
the same things out of life,

1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:24.680
because
she doesn't want me to be hurt.

1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:26.200
Yep.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:28.000
JAMIE-LEE: 'Cause
I don't live close to my family,

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:31.600
my friends are the people that
I call when I'm in times of need.

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.520
Both Monique and Dee
are very protective over me,

1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:35.640
especially Dee.

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:38.360
She knows me better
than sometimes I know myself.

1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:43.160
So, yeah, Dee's opinion on Brooke
is a really big deal to me.

1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:44.520
Don't be nervous.
No.

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:46.000
Look, I'm...I'm excited because

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000
I know how much
certain people mean to you.

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.920
I know how protective
my friends are of me, so, like, yeah.

1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:52.600
Yeah.
I'm...I'm...I'm prepared.

1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:55.080
Yeah. I'm...
I'm, like, "Bring it...bring it on."

1:05:55.080 --> 1:05:56.520
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:06:00.480
So I am a little bit nervous
about how Dee's going to...

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:03.680
..grill Brooke.

1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:08.480
Hello.
Hi! Hi!

1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:11.440
Oh, my gosh, hi!

1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:13.080
Oh, hey.
Hey!

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:15.760
Dee, this is Brooke.
Nice to meet you, Dee.

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:17.040
Mwah.

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:19.040
Jamie-Lee and I
have been through a lot together.

1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:21.480
She is my best mate.

1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:24.600
OK. Let me get you guys a wine.

1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:25.800
Yes!
Come on over.

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:27.200
Thank you.
(LAUGHS)

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:29.960
And her happiness is...

1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:31.840
..paramount to me.

1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:32.960
Shall we cheers?
Yeah.

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:34.240
Oh, yeah.
Oh! Absolutely.

1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:36.360
To, um...to a great lunch.
Oh.

1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:38.520
And to you guys.
And to you guys.

1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:41.000
Yes. Likewise.
Thank you for coming this far.

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.120
(ALL LAUGH)

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.960
DEE: So, how does it work?
Are you guys...?

1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:46.440
'Cause there's guys and girls.
BROOKE: Yep.

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:48.840
So are you dating...

1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:50.400
..three others?

1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:52.520
Mm-hm. Two boys, two girls.

1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:53.920
Oh, OK.
Yeah.

1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:55.160
Yeah.
Alright.

1:06:55.160 --> 1:06:58.560
It's quite concerning to me to hear
the fact that Brooke is dating

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:03.640
two other guys and another girl
aside from Jamie-Lee.

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:06.240
So I want to find out whether
Brooke's feelings for Jamie-Lee

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:08.280
are the real deal.

1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:10.120
I'd like to find out
a bit more about that,

1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:13.160
maybe without J around.

1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:16.320
(ALL LAUGH)
If you're OK with that, Brooke?

1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:18.520
JAMIE-LEE: Are you good?
Yeah.

1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:20.200
I promise I won't bite.

1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:23.600
All of a sudden, Dee doesn't hesitate
to send Jamie-Lee away.

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:25.560
I know it's hard.
I'll see you soon.

1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.840
See ya. (LAUGHS)

1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:29.520
OK.

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:32.080
And already I'm starting to feel
extremely nervous and intimidated,

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:34.560
because...Jamie-Lee did say

1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:36.840
that Dee was gonna hit me
with a hard question.

1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:40.800
DEE: I guess the reason
why I wanted J to leave was because

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:43.440
there were a few questions we had...

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:44.440
Mmm.

1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:47.040
..and I think particularly 'cause
you are dating three other people.

1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:50.440
Mmm.
What makes Jamie-Lee different?

1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:52.640
A lot of reasons.

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:57.240
Um...she is very communicative
and she's very sentimental

1:07:57.240 --> 1:08:01.320
and she puts in a lot of effort
to show that she cares for me.

1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:03.960
Yeah -
we just want to make sure that...

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:06.640
..she is gonna
be with somebody who...

1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:07.800
..appreciates her for who she is.

1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:11.200
She is a fiercely loyal person
who has her heart on her sleeve,

1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.520
and I could see
how she's looking at you.

1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:16.680
She's definitely in this,
and we just want to know that...

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:20.400
I definitely think she's all-in.
..you are also in it too.

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:22.640
Because
you've brought her all this way.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:23.640
Mmm.

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.560
And if you're
not serious about this...

1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:27.560
Yeah.

1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:29.720
..it's not gonna be easy.

1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:33.080
No, no, it's not gonna
be easy for either of us, whatever,

1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:35.280
but I hope it doesn't go that way.

1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:36.960
That's the hard thing for us too.

1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:39.240
We could see our friend...
You know, like...

1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:40.800
BOTH: Falling.
Yeah.

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:44.280
And we just want to know, can you
see yourself falling as well?

1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:46.760
Um...
MONIQUE: Yeah.

1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:48.480
Like, if she came to you now
and is, like, "I love you.

1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:49.960
"This is my heart on the line,"

1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:54.440
like, would that be
kind of met and reciprocated or...?

1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:56.440
Oh. It's...it's hard.

1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:59.120
Like, I would love
to say that to her.

1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:02.000
But I can't just
be throwing the L-word around.

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.680
I've got three other connections
that I've also got to consider.

1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:08.480
BROOKE: I'm definitely feeling
a lot of pressure from Mon and Dee.

1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:13.040
But are you feeling any?
Absolutely. I...I do care for her.

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:16.560
BROOKE: And they're asking
some pretty tough questions.

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:20.520
But I can only give my honest opinion
and my honest answer to those.

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:21.920
I've always been attracted
to Jamie-Lee.

1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:24.040
I've just never been able
to have that opportunity.

1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:28.280
And it's been really nice, like,
spending time with her,

1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:31.600
being affectionate with her,
'cause I enjoy time with her.

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:32.600
Yep.

1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:35.240
And, like, I never...

1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:37.360
..like...generally, like,
take my eyes off her.

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:40.960
Um...so...

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:43.320
(ALL LAUGH)

1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:46.920
Like, she is a beautiful woman,
and she carries herself so well,

1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:49.320
and I think, like,
if we were in the outside world,

1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:51.560
I think we would have
a really beautiful relationship.

1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:55.160
I think...we had
a beautiful friendship before it.
Yep.

1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:57.560
And I think now we're at
this beautiful level,

1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:59.360
I want to see where it goes.

1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:01.120
Mmm.
And that's why I'm meeting you guys.

1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:03.360
'Cause I'm not in it
for, like, the short.
Yeah.

1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:06.440
Like, this is the endgame for me,
hopefully.

1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:08.600
Do you know what I mean? So...
I'm happy to hear that.

1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:12.000
DEE: It has been really great
getting to know Brooke.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.280
It's really easy
to get along with her.

1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:16.640
And I can see
why Jamie-Lee is falling for her.

1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:18.120
You know, and I wish I could give you

1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:19.720
the answer
that you guys want to hear,

1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:21.520
like, I'm gonna choose Jamie-Lee
at the end.

1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:24.000
Yep.
But I still do have three other...

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.120
Tell us you're gonna choose
Jamie-Lee without telling us.

1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:31.120
DEE: Being Jamie-Lee's friend,
I am protective of her,

1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:33.880
and sometimes I do mother her
a little bit,

1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:37.080
which is probably not the best,
but...

1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:40.400
..it's only coming out of a place
of genuine care and love,

1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:42.480
and I do believe

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.800
that there is a genuine connection
between the two of them,

1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:48.920
and I just really hope
in the next few days

1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:51.240
that she lets Jamie-Lee know
where she stands,

1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:54.600
because Jamie-Lee is falling.

1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:00.920
It's actually been really lovely
getting to know you a bit more...

1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:01.920
Oh.

1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:03.280
..and seeing
how you guys are together.

1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:04.360
Likewise.

1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:07.040
JAMIE-LEE: Having Brooke
around my friends has really...

1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:09.320
..like, intensified things for me.

1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:11.440
Bye.
Hugs and kisses?

1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:13.680
JAMIE-LEE: It's made me really see

1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:17.200
what life would be like with her.

1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:19.080
Alright. See ya.
MONIQUE AND DEE: Bye.

1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:20.680
JAMIE-LEE: And...

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:23.800
..I am absolutely
falling in love with Brooke.

1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:26.240
I really am.
It's such a nice feeling.

1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.120
I forgot what this was like.

1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:31.560
Mmm.

1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:33.560
JAMIE-LEE: So, yeah, I...

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.120
..I think it's really important
that I tell her that.

1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:42.440
Seeing you fit in with my friends...

1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:45.480
..I could totally...

1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:48.800
..totally see you in my future.

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:51.160
And, yeah, I ju...I feel very lucky.

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:53.720
Yeah. I feel very lucky.

1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:58.040
(LAUGHS)
Oh! Come here, you big cutie.

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:05.720
I need to, like, not,
'cause I'm gonna cry. (LAUGHS)

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.600
Why?
'Cause, like...

1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:11.120
I really, really...

1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:14.800
..yeah, I definitely, um...

1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:17.560
..I really like you.

1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.240
And, like...yeah.

1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:24.880
I'm just, like,
excited for the future.

1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:29.120
Beautiful. Alright.
Alright, babe. Thank you so much.

1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:30.320
I'll see you soon.
Bye, babe.

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:31.760
OK. Alright.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.720
JAMIE-LEE:
I was a little bit nervous

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.680
saying goodbye
and speaking to Brooke.

1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:44.440
You know, there's
a lot of pressure riding on tonight

1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:45.760
and...and how today went.

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:50.840
(KISSES)

1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:52.400
Bye, babe.

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:54.880
And...

1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:57.560
..I realise that...

1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:01.760
..I don't know, I'm kind of
kicking myself now, to be honest.

1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:08.480
I wish that I had have said
that I'm falling in love with her.

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:10.920
And I am. I...I really am.

1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:16.200
So I don't know -
I just...I guess I hope

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:18.400
Brooke felt what I meant

1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:21.880
and felt what I was feeling.

1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:29.600
And I'm just hoping
that I get more time with her

1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:32.840
to tell her my true feelings.

1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:50.400
BROOKE: Today is Darvid's hometown,
and I'm really excited to see him.

1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.880
Darvid made a really great
first impression on me,

1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:59.120
and that feeling
hasn't gone away with Darvid.

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:01.080
When I'm with Darvid,
I...I feel safe.

1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:03.520
I feel calm. I feel comfortable.

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:07.920
I feel like I can be my complete
and utter weird self with him.

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:09.240
It's a beautiful feeling.

1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:11.480
So Darvid's coming over to my house.

1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:15.040
With the circumstance of the moment,
he is from Brissie,

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:18.520
so I thought we could probably
just meet the fam via video here.

1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:24.760
DARVID:
From the first moment I saw Brooke,

1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:27.800
I feel like there was a massive
connection and a massive spark,

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:30.360
and it's grown
into something special.

1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:33.880
Since our last single date, I really
realised how much I like her.

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:36.560
And I just want to further that
even more.

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.480
Today, it's time
for Brooke to meet my family.

1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.360
My mum, myself and my sister
are really close.

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:45.880
We all live very locally,
we catch up at least once a week,

1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:49.280
and my sister's pregnant,
so I'm soon to be an uncle.

1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:52.120
I want Brooke to be involved
in all of that.

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:54.760
The most intimidating person
for Brooke could be my mum.

1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:58.560
Mum's protective.
She wants the best for me.

1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:01.880
So I dare say she'll be asking
Brooke some hard-hitting questions

1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:03.880
and putting her on the spot
a bit today.

1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:05.680
(KNOCKS)

1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:09.760
Hello, handsome.
Hey. How are you?

1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:11.600
Hi!
I'm good.

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.960
Oh...
Oh...

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:14.000
Kiss.
Come here.

1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.840
As soon as I see Brooke,
my heart drops, in...in a good way.

1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:20.800
She looks stunning. She always does,
but today especially.

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:25.120
Her eyes are popping, her smile,
and I feel like a super-lucky man.

1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:28.000
What have you been up to?
Um, not much. Thinking about you.

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.320
Thinking about today.
I know.

1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:33.280
It's a big day. I'm excited.
It's...it'll be good.

1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:35.760
Who am I actually meeting?

1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:37.920
Mum and my sister.
OK.

1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:40.360
So I'll give you a run-down, so...
my family's pretty small.

1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:41.560
Yep.

1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:43.040
So Mum's...

1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:45.160
..obviously huge in my life.

1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:47.440
She's been there for me
for ev...through everything.

1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:49.400
Mum's a bit more protective.

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:53.040
Mum's lovely. She's English.

1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:54.800
But Mum will hit you
with some questions, I reckon.

1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:56.280
OK.
Yeah.

1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:59.760
So it's...it's really important,
I guess, that you guys get along.

1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:00.840
No pressure.

1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:02.240
But you will. You'll be fine.

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:04.280
BROOKE: I am extremely nervous.

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:08.120
I just know how important
Darvid's mum is to him.

1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:09.440
And...

1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:11.800
..I just want to make a good
impression, because it is important

1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:13.760
that I get along with her,
and I think...

1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:17.080
..I see that as a valuable
relationship to have with a partner,

1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:20.200
so...I hope she likes me.

1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:23.080
OK.
Alright.
Alright.

1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:24.080
I'm ready.
You ready for this?

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:27.200
Yep. (CLEARS THROAT)
(EXHALES)

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:29.600
Hey.

1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:31.760
Hey! (LAUGHS)

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:33.800
Oh, hi. It's so great...
It's nice to see you.

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:36.520
Yeah, great to see you. Long time.

1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:37.960
It's been a while, huh?

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:39.320
Feels like forever.
Lots has happened.

1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:42.560
DARVID: This is Roya, like,
my sister, and my mum, obviously.

1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:45.720
So nice to meet you. I've heard
lots about you through Darv.

1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:47.840
Oh! That's nice.
Thank you.
Thank you.

1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:50.840
MUM: I think
they look very happy together.

1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:52.400
You look good together.

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:56.360
But...all I know about Brooke
is what the media portrays her as

1:16:56.360 --> 1:16:58.680
or what I've seen on TV.

1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:00.600
I don't know her as a person.

1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:02.720
DARVID: I was really looking forward
to this point.

1:17:02.720 --> 1:17:05.160
I wish we could have met in person,
obviously, but...

1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:07.720
..you know how much I respect
your guys' opinion on everything,

1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:12.120
and it's so important to me
that you both get along with Brooke.

1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:14.040
MUM:
I suppose what I'm worried about

1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:16.560
is that she'd only just
moved to Melbourne.

1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:20.760
So the main question
I'd like to ask her today is

1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:22.680
whether she'd be prepared
to move to Brisbane,

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:25.720
which is where Darv is, um, living.

1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:29.640
If Darv came home and said to me
he's moving to Melbourne tomorrow,

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.000
I...I think I'd kill him,
I really would.

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.880
He'd be leaving a business behind,
leaving his family.

1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:37.280
It's...nope. It's just not on.

1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:40.200
So I think it might be
a good opportunity now

1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:44.040
for me to talk with Brooke,
just one on one, perhaps.

1:17:44.040 --> 1:17:46.120
DARVID: Yeah. Alright.
BROOKE: Of course.
DARVID: Yeah.

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:47.560
OK.
Don't scare her off, Mum.

1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:50.920
I'll try not to.
I'm good. I'm good. I'm a big girl.

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:54.800
(SIGHS) Breathe, Brooke, breathe.
(LAUGHS)

1:17:56.360 --> 1:18:01.080
So, I suppose I really need
to ask you some hard questions.

1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:04.640
I do have a few concerns.

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.480
OK.

1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:12.200
Um, you know, Darv is very special
to us. We're a very close family.

1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:15.640
We do actually live
in the same street at the moment,

1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:19.040
and Roya lives in the next suburb.

1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:22.160
And so we do get together
very frequently.

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:26.760
So, I'm just wondering,
being both interstate,

1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:28.800
how will that work?

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:31.000
Um...

1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:38.360
That's a good question. Um...

1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:44.920
Look, I love Brissie, but I have
only just moved to Melbourne from WA,

1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:47.000
but I think...

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:48.520
..um...

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:53.160
..but we haven't got to that...that
stage of that discussion just yet.

1:18:54.680 --> 1:19:00.440
When reality kicks in
and when he has to run his business,

1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:02.680
are you happy to come to Brisbane?

1:19:02.680 --> 1:19:04.640
Um...

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.280
..I would love to just
stay in Melbourne just for, like,

1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:10.520
the rest of the year
and just see how that would work out,

1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:16.080
um, but, like, I really am supportive
of Darvid's set-up in Brissie, so...

1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:18.720
..I know that I can
kind of pack up and move.

1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:24.120
I haven't quite settled in Melbourne,
so I'm, like, very open.

1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:25.960
I'm happy to hear that.

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:29.280
All I'm looking for
is that reassurance, really,

1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:31.440
and I think you've given me that.

1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:35.120
Living in different states
is gonna be a problem.

1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:38.280
Like, he lives in Brissie,
I live in Vic, but I'm from WA.

1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:39.680
Like, Elaine's being a realist.

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:43.600
Like, she's bringing up questions
that maybe we haven't thought about.

1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:45.040
Everything that you're saying
is so valid,

1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:47.480
and I understand
where you're coming from.

1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:49.240
Yeah, I think...

1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:52.520
..I have questions for Darv
about that, and I think...

1:19:52.520 --> 1:19:55.600
..either way, it's something
that we both have to discuss.

1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:57.240
BROOKE: So...

1:19:57.240 --> 1:20:00.800
..if this relationship
is to go any further, and progress,

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:03.560
I think these logistical things
would definitely be something

1:20:03.560 --> 1:20:07.160
that Darvid and I
really need to talk about.

1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:12.080
DARVID: Hey. How you doing?

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:13.840
Nice to see you both.

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:18.680
It was so nice to have a chat
to Brooke and see you and catch up.

1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:20.560
It was really lovely
to meet you guys.

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:21.600
He's got some...

1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.400
..beautiful women leading him.

1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:26.880
Nice to see you together, and...

1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:29.520
..we hope that, Brooke,
we'll be seeing you again soon.

1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:31.280
We really hope so.

1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:33.880
Very formal, Mum. I love it.
Yes.

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:35.400
(ALL LAUGH)

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:38.960
DARVID: After seeing Brooke
interact with my family,

1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:40.840
my feelings have developed
even further.

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:42.560
Your arm?

1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:44.040
Mmm.
Mm-hm?

1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:47.120
Brooke and I's connection
feels very real.

1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:48.920
I've really enjoyed today. I think...

1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:50.640
It's...it's been good.
Mmm.

1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:51.800
It's been nice.

1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:53.800
You've got some really beautiful
women that...around you.

1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:55.360
Like, I...
Yeah.

1:20:55.360 --> 1:20:57.080
..I feel so lucky
that I did get a chance to meet them,

1:20:57.080 --> 1:20:58.840
'cause I can understand
why they're so protective

1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:00.720
and care for you so much.

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:03.680
I'm so smitten,
I am so smitten, with you.

1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:05.240
Like, I am...no, but serious.

1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:06.720
I think you're...

1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:08.520
..absolutely beautiful.

1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:10.400
You're an amazing person.

1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:13.840
And, like, I completely enjoy
our time together and...

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:16.400
..it's really special to me.

1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:17.680
I mean that.
Yeah.

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:19.400
(LAUGHS)

1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:30.040
BROOKE:
I am absolutely smitten for Darvid.

1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:31.200
And...

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.840
..like, I miss him
every time I leave him.

1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:36.160
Mmm.

1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:39.320
Gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you.

1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:41.960
BROOKE: But I think
today was a bit of an eye-opener.

1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:44.000
I will see you.

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.480
Soon.
Yep.

1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:47.600
I'll miss you.
You too.

1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:51.000
Take care of yourself.
I will.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.480
I will.
Think of me? (LAUGHS)

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:54.280
I will. (LAUGHS) Don't worry.

1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:57.880
Bye.
Bye.

1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:00.760
BROOKE: Because...maybe we are
living in this love bubble

1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:04.920
that, like, realistically
might not work in the real world.

1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:24.280
HOLLY: I'm feeling really...

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:26.480
..really giddy and excited.

1:22:26.480 --> 1:22:29.080
I am stoked
that I'm gonna get the chance

1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:31.880
to bring Brooke home
to meet my family.

1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:35.920
Mine and Brooke's relationship
has developed really naturally.

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:38.960
Oh, my God!
There's actually fireworks!

1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:41.680
Aw!

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:44.960
HOLLY: Every chance that we've had
to spend time together

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:47.880
has just been high after high.

1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:51.600
Holly, will you accept this rose?
I will.

1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:52.840
Can I kiss you now?
Of course.

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:59.200
HOLLY: It's really easy, and on my
first single date, I felt a spark,

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:01.560
and that spark
is just continuing to grow.

1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:06.320
But I do have a side of nerves.

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.920
She is the first girl that
I've brought home to meet my mum.

1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:12.720
And my mum's opinion
means the world to me.

1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:16.080
So...I'm really excited
to bring her home,

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:20.200
and I hope that my family sees
all the good in her that I see.

1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:23.200
BROOKE: I have been waiting for this,

1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:26.800
to be in the Northern Beaches today
to meet Holly's family.

1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:29.280
I know she's never introduced a girl
to her family,

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:32.360
so I know that this is really big
for her, but I am, like...

1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:34.120
..I'm really excited. (LAUGHS)

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:38.120
Hello.

1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:39.760
Hi!
Beautiful.

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:42.000
How are you?
I'm good. How are YOU?

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.560
BROOKE:
I like numerous things about Holly.

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:46.000
I love how confident she is.

1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.920
She's a very self-assured woman,

1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:49.880
and I've never really...

1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:52.360
..met anyone like her.

1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:54.080
Give me a cuddle.
Hi.

1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:56.640
Oh! How are you?
I'm good.

1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:59.520
You're good?
I've missed you. (LAUGHS)

1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:01.040
She always leaves me wanting more.

1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:03.920
I've brought you a little something.
Oh, thank you.

1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:08.200
She's just so beautiful,
and I feel like both of us together,

1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:12.160
it would be a very strong
and very beautiful relationship,

1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:15.920
so I really hope today that I can
make a good impression on her family.

1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:17.600
Who am I meeting today?

1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:19.560
So...

1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:21.360
..you're meeting
my twin sister, Paige,

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:23.240
and my little sister, Chelsea.

1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:24.360
OK. And then...
My mum.

1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:26.600
Your mum.
My mum, Susie.

1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:29.440
She is, like, the
most important person in my life.

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:34.560
She's very thoughtful and
she's a very good reader of people.

1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:36.120
She'll let me know

1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:39.000
if a partner is gonna
be the right one for me before...

1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:40.320
Alright.
..I even know.

1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:42.520
So is Mum...Mumsy the one
I have to kind of...

1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:43.520
Yeah.
..impress?

1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:45.040
Yes. Yeah.

1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:47.360
My mum
is a very good judge of character.

1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:49.280
She's a pretty straight shooter.

1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:52.680
So...yeah,
she'll tell it like it is today.

1:24:52.680 --> 1:24:54.800
There's gonna be
no beating around the bush.

1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:58.720
Well, it's been a while now.
I know.
I'm very excited to see her.

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:00.320
And to meet Brooke.
It's gonna be exciting.

1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:01.400
Yeah.

1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:03.400
HOLLY: I think
after the last rose ceremony,

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:05.360
everything's become a lot more real.

1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:08.800
It's no longer just us
in this little bubble.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:12.240
It's how are we gonna fit in
in the big wide world?

1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:15.320
So...I'm sure
that my mum and my sisters

1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:17.520
have some questions
they want answered.

1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:20.080
(LAUGHS)

1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:23.480
(GASPING)
BROOKE: Oh, my God!

1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:25.080
(LAUGHS) You go.

1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:27.520
Hello. How are you?
Hi!

1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:30.040
Hi. I'm Chelsea.
Hello.

1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:33.200
I've heard lots of things...
good things about you.

1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:35.480
I finally
get to meet the family, and...

1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:37.960
..so far, they seem really lovely.

1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:41.120
Hi. It's good to meet you.
Nice to meet YOU.

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:42.760
Nice to meet you too.

1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:44.160
I'm a little bit scared.

1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.880
Susie sounds like
a very protective mum over Holly.

1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:50.440
Shall we cheers? Yeah.

1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:51.800
Cheers to a delicious...
Yeah.

1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:53.360
Thank you, guys, for coming.
..lunch, we hope.

1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:56.440
And, you know,
she's quite an intuitive woman.

1:25:56.440 --> 1:25:59.560
Makes me a little bit nervous.
(LAUGHS)

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:02.480
So it must be different, Brooke,
I would think, this time.

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:07.440
Now, not only because
you're the person...you are...

1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:09.280
..you are the prize, so to speak.

1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:11.160
(LAUGHS)
HOLLY: You're a catch.

1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:13.040
SUSIE:
Yeah. You...you are the prize.

1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:15.960
Um, but do you find it different
now that you've got

1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:17.800
boys that are
vying for your attention

1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:20.720
as well as girls
that are vying for your attention?

1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:22.200
Um...

1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:25.000
SUSIE: Meeting Brooke today
is very significant,

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:28.440
because Holly hasn't brought home
a female partner

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.480
for any of us to meet yet,

1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:32.480
so it's a bit...

1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:34.640
..of an anomaly for us to...

1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:36.840
..number one, to be meeting
Brooke as a female partner,

1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:41.200
and number two, in this sort of
pressure cooker situation,

1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:43.840
where we're meeting her and perhaps
having quite serious conversations,

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:45.920
because time is compressed.

1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:48.440
Are you in Perth...
Perth metropolitan area

1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:49.920
or outside of there?

1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:51.480
Um...

1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:56.120
..my home town is actually nine
hours from Perth, north of Perth.

1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:59.640
But I moved to Melbourne and I was
kind of just settling into Melbourne.

1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:03.480
And it must be hard, if you're
over here and your family are in WA.

1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:06.880
I guess those sort of roots
must pull fairly strongly...

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:08.680
Very tight. Yep.
..at you, yeah.

1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:10.600
(LAUGHS) Um...yeah.

1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:13.000
I think we haven't really
touched on that, Holls, have we?

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.160
Like...
Mmm.

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:15.600
..I think for me,
being home on country

1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:17.120
is a big thing for my culture,

1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:20.080
and I think everything
kind of generally pulls you back.

1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:21.920
So I think...

1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:24.480
..I do see myself always, like,
going back home

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:27.040
and, like, being on country
and settling down.

1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:35.240
But that could be another,
like, 10 or 15 years.

1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:37.000
Kind of keep my options always open.

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000
Like, you can't always
be over-prepared...

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.480
No.
..for whatever's to come.

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.920
But I guess for you particularly,

1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:46.280
that...that pull might be stronger
than someone simply saying,

1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:47.760
"Oh, I used to live there.

1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:50.400
"I've moved here
and I might go back one day,
'cause I liked it there."

1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:51.400
Mmm.

1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:53.080
I think the pull would be
a lot stronger.

1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:55.600
Um...and meaningful.
Look, I'm not gonna disagree, yeah.

1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:57.160
Like, it...it could definitely...

1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:58.800
..it...it's pulling me back now.

1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:00.960
Mmm.
And I have just moved to Melbourne.

1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:04.960
SUSIE: Hearing Brooke
talking about settling down

1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:07.520
eventually in Western Australia,

1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:09.120
that's a real red flag.

1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:11.520
Holly. I'm gonna steal Brooke away
for a chat now.

1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:13.800
(LAUGHTER)

1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:15.080
If that's alright.
Yeah, of course.

1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:17.440
SUSIE: Because that puts Holly
a long way from her family.

1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:19.240
And that really worries me.

1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:21.160
I don't think
it would sit well with Holly.

1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:26.080
So, you've had a bit of time
to get to know Brooke now.

1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:27.600
Do you see her
fitting into the family?

1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:29.560
I see her fitting in really well.

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.280
Yeah, I can see her fitting in
really well in Sydney.

1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:35.480
What about you
slotting into life in Perth?

1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:38.080
So, yeah, Brooke and I
hadn't spoken about that.

1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:43.160
I don't know anyone in Perth, and
it's really far away from you guys.

1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:47.080
That's the first time
that's come up.

1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:49.680
It's a lot to think about.
Yeah.

1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:51.960
Moving for love
is something that I'm open for,

1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:54.960
and I feel like it's easy for me
to picture myself

1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:57.800
either moving down to Melbourne
or Brooke moving up to Sydney.

1:28:57.800 --> 1:28:59.600
But...

1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:01.760
..Brooke and I have not spoken
about the fact

1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:05.560
that she would like to
move back to WA to start a family.

1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:08.680
You know,
I don't feel like the WA move

1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:10.480
was something
she was hiding from me.

1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:12.600
I think that
we just haven't had the chance

1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:16.200
to talk that far
in the future, and...

1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:22.560
..I don't know if I'm willing
to move across the country.

1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:25.360
SUSIE:
I know time's limited, Brooke,

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:28.160
and it's been really great
getting to know you today,

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:31.720
and I appreciate that you've
opened up about yourself and...

1:29:31.720 --> 1:29:32.760
Thank you.

1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:34.280
..given a little picture
into your life,

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:37.000
but I wanted
to take a moment to talk,

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.760
probably to be Holly's advocate
in all of this,

1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:42.040
so I guess, um,
I've got a couple of things

1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:44.120
that I'd like
to speak with you about.

1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:47.600
I know how Holly feels

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:50.400
about a family and children
in the future, moving forward.

1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:51.520
Mmm.

1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:55.640
And I guess...what were
YOUR thoughts with a family and...

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.840
..having children
or not having children?

1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:01.600
Um...children's
definitely on the cards for me.

1:30:01.600 --> 1:30:04.200
And...
I'm well prepared...
One? Two? Three? Six?

1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:08.280
Oh, I would actually love
two biologic...my own, to have them,

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:11.880
and then...maybe adopt or foster.

1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:13.160
Um...

1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:16.120
I guess that's...concerning,

1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:19.720
because I do know
that Holly has always voiced

1:30:19.720 --> 1:30:23.520
that she would have, ideally,
no children or maybe one.

1:30:25.600 --> 1:30:27.400
I want a whole (BLEEP) tribe.

1:30:33.760 --> 1:30:36.160
It's really important that...

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:38.560
..any relationship
be on the same page with that,

1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:40.680
'cause I know
the stress it can cause.

1:30:40.680 --> 1:30:41.760
(SIGHS)

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:44.280
The number of children,
I've always been so honest about.

1:30:44.280 --> 1:30:46.440
And it's always been
a non-negotiable.

1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:50.360
And to hear that Holly
doesn't really want any children...

1:30:52.400 --> 1:30:54.960
..I feel
completely and utterly blindsided.

1:31:16.680 --> 1:31:19.640
What were your thoughts
with a family and...

1:31:19.640 --> 1:31:22.680
..having children
or not having children?

1:31:22.680 --> 1:31:23.800
Um...

1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:25.760
..I...I do want children.

1:31:25.760 --> 1:31:27.400
I guess that's...

1:31:27.400 --> 1:31:28.640
..concerning.

1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:32.080
Because Holly has always voiced

1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:36.320
that she would have, ideally,
no children or maybe one.

1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:37.440
You know, a really small...

1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:38.800
Small family.
..family.

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:41.960
I found it a huge surprise
when Susie had told me

1:31:41.960 --> 1:31:46.760
that Holly doesn't want children,
or wants one,

1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:49.560
because I feel like
the number of children

1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:51.960
has always been
a bit of a non-negotiable for me.

1:31:51.960 --> 1:31:55.040
It's just something
that I have my heart set on.

1:31:55.040 --> 1:31:57.120
But I also have
my heart set on Holly,

1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:02.320
so I have to really take in
what her needs are as well.

1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:05.080
I think that's a really good
consideration to know.

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:08.240
Thank...thank you for sharing,
and I think,

1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:11.320
um, it's nice to have
a little bit more, I guess,

1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:13.920
clarity moving into this.

1:32:13.920 --> 1:32:17.440
Like, it...it wouldn't change
how I feel about Holly.

1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:18.920
It would just be

1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:21.360
maybe a little bit more
of a compromise in the relationship.

1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:23.960
And that's...
and that's so the case too, but...

1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:27.920
..I guess
I just am concerned that...

1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:30.360
..you know, for both of you, like,
that's a...that's a big deal,

1:32:30.360 --> 1:32:32.600
because that's
not gonna be compatible.

1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:34.800
Yep.

1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:36.560
SUSIE: You only want your children
to be happy

1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:39.840
and you only want
their relationships to be happy,

1:32:39.840 --> 1:32:44.040
but sometimes someone has to be
the voice of reality,

1:32:44.040 --> 1:32:47.360
and I'm concerned
that Brooke's life might follow

1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:49.400
a different path than Holly's.

1:32:49.400 --> 1:32:52.080
It's really important
that any relationship

1:32:52.080 --> 1:32:53.720
be on the same page with that,

1:32:53.720 --> 1:32:57.800
so, for your sake moving forward,
and for her sake,

1:32:57.800 --> 1:32:59.440
those things
will need to be discussed.

1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:01.720
Yeah. Absolutely.

1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:05.520
SUSIE: There seems to be a genuine
affection between her and Holly,

1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:06.960
but I'm a realist.

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:11.360
If they can't resolve
the big barriers that are there,

1:33:11.360 --> 1:33:14.960
then I can't see a future.

1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:21.400
Did you have a nice chat?

1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:23.520
Yeah. I think we had a good chat.
Yeah. No, we did. Yeah.

1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:25.320
It's a good chat.
It's...it was good.

1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:28.320
It was good to...
ask a few more questions.

1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:29.720
BROOKE:
After my chat with Susie tonight,

1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:33.120
I definitely feel like
I need to have a chat with Holly,

1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:36.680
because there have been things
that have come up today about her

1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:40.480
that are totally the opposite
of what I thought.

1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:41.520
Bye.
Bye.
See ya.

1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:44.320
BROOKE: And I thought
that in almost every single date,

1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:48.400
I've been very open and honest about
the fact that I wanted to have kids.

1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:51.440
And family is really important to me.

1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:54.560
But I don't think
I've really actually asked Holly,

1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:58.520
having the answers from Holly,
does she want the same things?

1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:04.000
How'd you find today?
I enjoyed today.

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:05.240
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.

1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:06.920
Did you enjoy today?
I did.

1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:09.160
Oh, it was so good to see my family.

1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:12.280
Mmm.
And to have you be with them.

1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:16.120
I think...yeah, I think you fit in
really well with my family and...

1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:18.720
..you know, on the Northern Beaches.

1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:20.560
Yeah.
Did my, uh...Mum grill you?

1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:23.600
A little bit.
But she obviously cares for you.
Yeah.

1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:25.520
And I know that she was, like,
probably the...

1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:27.200
..person that...

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:28.920
..you...

1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:30.600
..look to...
Mmm.

1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:32.600
..and for direction,
and I think also for, like,

1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:34.080
whose opinion matters most.

1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:35.560
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:38.600
I did find out, though, like,
from your mum, actually,

1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:40.960
is it true that you don't want kids?

1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:45.360
I want a small family.

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:46.920
OK.
Yeah.

1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:51.120
Like, I just think, yeah, I, um...
was surprised by that.
Mmm.

1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:52.880
I don't think you've
actually ever given me a number.

1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:54.560
Mmm.
And I was bit, like, "Oh, OK."

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:55.560
Like...
Yeah.

1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:57.800
Um...but, like,

1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:03.640
these are all very valid questions
that we need to talk about.

1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:05.680
So...like, please think,

1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:07.640
if there's anything
that you need to ask as well,

1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:10.280
don't be afraid to, like, just ask.

1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:11.280
Yeah, I think...
Just ask.

1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:14.680
..the biggest thing
for me today was...

1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:17.840
..I didn't know that
you'd be wanting to move back to WA.

1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:18.960
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:20.480
And...like...

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:23.080
..I know it's, like,
a 10-, 15-year thing...

1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:24.080
Mmm.

1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:29.400
..um, and relationships chop
and change and compromise and stuff,

1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:31.120
but...

1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:33.040
..I was...yeah.

1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:35.560
I was, like...in my head...
you know, I've been to Melbourne,

1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:39.280
I've...know the city,
I can see myself there.

1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:40.920
Mmm.

1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:44.040
But I'm not sure
if I can see myself in WA.

1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:52.960
OK. Yeah.

1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:54.480
Alright.

1:35:54.480 --> 1:35:56.080
Hmm.

1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:57.800
Makes sense.

1:35:57.800 --> 1:35:59.440
OK.

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:02.560
OK.
OK. You sure?

1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:04.880
Mmm...

1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:06.400
..no, it's...it's...it's fair enough.

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:08.200
Like, I get it.

1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:10.160
I didn't think you were
hiding it from me or anything.

1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:11.160
Yep.

1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:12.400
I think it was just a...

1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:14.640
..these things come out in time.

1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:15.640
I get it.

1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:18.320
BROOKE:
I feel very conflicted right now.

1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:24.600
I didn't think we had any flags
or concerns or non-negotiables

1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:26.320
that we hadn't discussed already.

1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:29.480
I thought that Holly was wanting
children and wanting a family

1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:33.160
and would be open to moving to WA.

1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:35.280
It just creates
a bit of an uneasiness with me.

1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:36.680
Yeah.
It's not anything to do with you.

1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:38.440
Sorry. I'm projecting.
That's OK. No. That's OK.

1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:40.800
I don't mean that.
I mean, like...uh...

1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:44.360
It's just, like, a...

1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:48.080
Is it a big 'nother consideration?
Well, no.

1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:49.800
It's just an uncomfortable feeling,
if that was...

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.320
..not that it's the case coming soon,

1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:53.360
but I'm just saying, like,
in the future.

1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:55.560
BROOKE: But now I just feel like
we're both discovering

1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:58.880
these huge things about each other

1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:00.960
and what we want in our futures

1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:04.240
and realising that we may be
on separate pages here.

1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:07.480
(SIGHS)

1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:12.760
Oh, I don't even know what to say.
I'm just, like, stuck. Hang on.

1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:14.160
Give me a moment.

1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:17.720
BROOKE: I've never had doubts,
I've never had questions with Holly.

1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:20.720
But now I've, like...

1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:22.160
..maybe this is a problem.

1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:24.040
I just fully just, like...

1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:28.520
..you know, didn't see it coming.

1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:37.000
Alright. OK.
Bye.

1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:38.480
OK.
See ya.

1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:41.320
BROOKE: Like, I just don't know
where I'm standing right now

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:42.920
and I'm, like...

1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:46.280
..this is one of my strongest
connections, one of my, like,

1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:49.320
connections
that had been from the top.

1:38:56.400 --> 1:38:59.600
HOLLY: I've been quite sure
going into most rose ceremonies.

1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:02.960
But...

1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:04.680
..Brooke and I
left our hometown visit

1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:07.880
with a lot of questions
still up in the air,

1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:11.120
and I don't know how she's feeling
about everyone else.

1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:14.440
So I actually don't know
where that leaves me.

1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:23.920
Good evening, ladies.
Good evening, gentlemen.

1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:29.120
Must have been exciting to
introduce Brooke to your loved ones.

1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:30.720
However...

1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:33.960
..important realities
have to be faced.

1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:39.080
There's four of you here.

1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:41.120
Brooke has only three roses to give.

1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:45.680
I'm sorry, but tonight,
one of you will leave the mansion.

1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:49.800
Here's Brooke.

1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:56.200
KONRAD: The last few days have been
an emotional roller-coaster.

1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.480
Brooke met my family at hometowns.

1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:01.120
I feel like
it went really well, but...

1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:03.160
..there was
still some concerns from Brooke,

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:07.760
and I don't know if I answered them
enough to put her mind at ease.

1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:22.400
Darvid.

1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:30.000
Darvid, will you accept this rose?

1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.440
Of course.

1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:36.600
Thanks.

1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:02.120
Jamie-Lee.

1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:09.560
Jamie-Lee,
will you accept this rose?

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.240
Of course. Thank you, Brooke.

1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:17.640
HOLLY: I'd be really hurt
if this was the end of Brooke and I.

1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:23.840
KONRAD: I want to show her
I have the stability.

1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:25.480
I want to answer those questions.

1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:27.800
And...

1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:30.680
..I want to be with her
at the end of this.

1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:52.240
Holly.

1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:04.040
Holly, will you accept this rose?

1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:32.080
Konrad.

1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:35.280
I'm sorry,
but you did not receive a rose.

1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:37.640
Please take the time now
to say goodbye.

1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:16.520
Sorry.
It's alright.

1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:20.040
This has been, like, really hard,
to make this decision.

1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:23.360
'Cause I really care for you.

It's alright - I...

..this is about you,
you know, finding the right person,

1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:35.480
so...there's no hard feelings.

1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:38.040
You know I think you're amazing.

1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:40.160
I think you're amazing too -
um, I've been blessed that,

1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:41.760
you know,
our lives have crossed paths,

1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:45.200
and I've cherished
a friendship with you, you know.

1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:47.120
You're a beautiful person.

1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:49.480
(SIGHS) Yeah.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:50.840
It's all good.

1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:00.520
I do.

1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:14.720

1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:25.760
KONRAD: I don't know. I don't know
what to think right now.

1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:29.080
I was really falling in love
with the girl, um, so I suppose...

1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.680
..she's done the right thing
by me...

1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:33.200
(SIGHS)

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:35.800
..not letting it go any further,
you know,

1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:38.440
not allowing me
to sort of get any more invested.

1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:41.240
Uh, if she had doubts,
I'm glad that she...

1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:46.200
..she's...she's done this now and...
and hasn't sort of led me on.

1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:50.520
It just makes me just...

1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:53.040
..not want to put myself out there
anymore.

Yeah,
we're getting back into nature.

1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:10.640
Hello.

in love with Brooke.

1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:20.560
Phew! Getting all flushed.

1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:21.720
..before...

1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:23.240
I think we've found our roadblock.

1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:26.080
DARVID: I can't just pack up
and leave, and neither can she.

1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:27.360
..some harsh truths...

1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:30.080
I don't know where to go from here.

1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:31.160
..and heartbreak.

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.760
That just takes me back
to previous relationships

1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:37.440
where they're just gonna be, like,
"Oh, I love you, but..."

1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:44.280
I came here to find love. (SNIFFLES)

1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:46.440
And it's slamming me in the heart

1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:50.240
that that's probably not
what's gonna happen here.
