12:25.537 --> 12:27.389
Sure do love you.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.017
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.103
- How are you today?
- Fine, thank you.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.563
That's good.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.482
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.193
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Karl.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.281
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.784
- Rats?
- I'm afraid so.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.244
But the attic is clean.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.162
All right, then,
we've got clean rats.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.624
- No, no. No rats.
- I just heard them, Karl.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.042
Maybe plumbing.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.379
Yeah, or maybe rats. Now,
will you just get the traps?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.797
Yes, I go now.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.841
Don't go now. The
stores aren't open yet.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.759
- I'll go see.
- They're closed!

13:05.452 --> 13:07.393
In the group over here...

13:07.454 --> 13:09.806
I need a priest, a nun
and two students.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.311
That's what we want. That's
exactly what we want.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.816
Burke. Oh, Burke.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.818
- Is this scene really essential?
- Chris.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.778
Just consider if we
can do without it.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.781
Take a look at this damn thing.
It just doesn't make sense.

13:26.848 --> 13:30.827
It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.247
- Come on. I can read, for Christ's sake.
- Well, what's wrong?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.666
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

13:36.733 --> 13:39.836
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, I believe.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.171
- Hiding?
- Fucking.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.843
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.846
All right. Hustle, background.
And action.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.574
Hasn't there been enough killing?

13:53.124 --> 13:54.726
Is this your campus?

13:56.253 --> 13:59.189
Get the Defense Department
off this campus!

14:01.091 --> 14:03.026
It's our school!

14:03.093 --> 14:05.195
- You have no rights!
- Hypocrite!

14:05.262 --> 14:07.322
Military complex, man!

14:07.389 --> 14:09.240
And action, Chris.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.451
I've seen enough killing
in my lifetime!

14:13.103 --> 14:15.121
There's no need for it!

14:17.399 --> 14:20.502
That's right! That's right!

14:21.528 --> 14:24.547
We're all concerned with human
rights, for God's sake...

14:24.614 --> 14:27.550
but the kids who want to get
an education have a right too!

14:32.998 --> 14:36.893
Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!

14:39.462 --> 14:42.732
You can't accomplish anything by
shutting kids off from their...

14:47.512 --> 14:51.157
- If you want... Hold it, hold it!
- Quiet!

14:51.224 --> 14:54.744
If you want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.333
Okay, cut. That's a wrap.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.560
- I'll walk home tonight.
- Okay.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.187
Here, take that and drop
it at my house, yeah?

15:21.338 --> 15:23.189
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.688
There's not a day in my life
that I don't feel like a fraud.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.175
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.
I've talked to them all.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.210
I don't know anyone
who hasn't felt that.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.493
Hello?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.078
In here.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.956
- Hi. How did your day go?
- Oh, not too bad.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.418
It was like the, uh, Walt Disney
version of the Ho Chi Minh story.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.836
Other than that, terrific.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.631
- What we got, anything exciting?
- Here.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.342
- Oh, all right.
- And also, you got an invitation.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.053
- What's this?
- Dinner at the White House.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.472
You're kidding. Is it a
big party or something?

16:37.539 --> 16:38.932
I think it's five or six people.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.935
Oh. Thursday, huh? All right.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.144
Hi, Mom.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.146
What'd you do today?

16:45.213 --> 16:46.981
- Stuff.
- What's that mean, stuff?

16:47.048 --> 16:50.985
Well, uh, me and Sharon played
a game in the backyard.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.488
- You did.
- And we had a picnic down by the river.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.490
That sounds good.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.699
You should have seen.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.869
This man came along on
this beautiful gray horse.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.746
- Really? What kind?
- Wasn't he pretty?

17:01.813 --> 17:03.998
Was it a mare, a gelding, what?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.209
- I think it was a gelding.
- Mm-hm.

17:06.276 --> 17:09.002
It was gray. Oh,
it was so beautiful.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.422
The guy let me ride it all
around and everything.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.628
- You're kidding.
- She rode for half an hour.

17:13.657 --> 17:18.680
It was so nice. Oh, I loved it.
Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse?

17:18.747 --> 17:22.224
- Not while we're in Washington, honey.
- Why not, Mom? Ha, ha.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.227
We'll see when we get home, okay?

17:24.294 --> 17:27.021
- When could I have one?
- We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.400
Hey, listen, on the party invitations,
I wanted to write a personal...

17:30.467 --> 17:33.319
- Regan, don't! Regan, come back here!
- Ha-ha-ha.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.410
- All right, give it up. Give it up!
- No!

17:40.477 --> 17:42.537
- Ooh!
- Ha-ha-ha.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.330
- You'll be sorry! Come on.
- No!

18:15.178 --> 18:16.613
Father?

18:16.679 --> 18:19.240
Could you help an old altar boy?

18:19.307 --> 18:20.450
I'm a Catholic.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.642
All right, come on, man.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.029
- What, are you crazy?
- Go ahead.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.705
Mama?

19:58.781 --> 20:00.508
Mama?

20:01.492 --> 20:02.885
Mama?

20:03.870 --> 20:07.056
Dimmy! Dimmy!

20:10.752 --> 20:12.395
Oh, how are you, Mama?

20:12.462 --> 20:14.731
- I'm so glad to see you.
- You look good.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.607
I'm all right.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.235
- How's your leg?
- How about you? You are all right?

20:19.302 --> 20:20.737
I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.995
Your Uncle John passed
by to visit me.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.497
- Oh, really? When?
- Last month.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.421
- Too tight?
- No.

20:39.280 --> 20:43.509
You have to stay off it. You can't go up and
down the stairs. You have to give it a rest.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.094
Okay.

20:55.296 --> 20:59.025
I could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.987
There would be people around. You wouldn't
be sitting here listening to a radio.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.993
You understand me?

21:09.060 --> 21:13.873
This is my house and I'm
not going no place.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.971
Dimmy, you worry for something?

21:29.038 --> 21:31.140
- No, Mama.
- You are not happy?

21:31.207 --> 21:33.059
Tell me, what is the matter?

21:33.126 --> 21:36.396
Mama, I'm all right.
I'm fine. Really, I am.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.098
Here it comes.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.599
There.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.170
- Oh, look at that.
- Do you like it?

22:18.171 --> 22:21.023
Aw, isn't that funny? Ha, ha.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.861
I better put him over here
to dry, though. He's still wet.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.321
Oh, here we go.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.032
There, he can dry there.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.368
Hey, where'd this come from?

22:33.436 --> 22:35.955
- I found it.
- Where?

22:37.315 --> 22:38.708
Closet.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.252
Huh.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.045
You been playing with it?

22:43.112 --> 22:45.214
- Yup.
- Do you know how?

22:45.281 --> 22:47.216
I'll show you.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.889
Wait a minute. You need two.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.350
No, you don't.
I do it all the time.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.728
Oh, yeah? Well, let's
both play with it.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.065
You really don't want
me to play, huh?

23:03.132 --> 23:06.444
No, I do. Captain Howdy said no.

23:06.511 --> 23:09.572
- Captain who?
- Captain Howdy.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.240
Who's Captain Howdy?

23:11.307 --> 23:15.119
You know. I make the questions
and he does the answers.

23:15.186 --> 23:18.956
- Oh, Captain Howdy. Yeah, I see.
- He's nice.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.083
Oh, I'll bet he is.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.086
- Here, I'll show you.
- All right.

23:24.153 --> 23:28.257
Captain Howdy, do you
think my mom's pretty?

23:30.118 --> 23:32.220
Captain Howdy?

23:32.286 --> 23:34.472
Captain Howdy,
that isn't very nice.

23:34.539 --> 23:37.141
- Well, maybe he's sleeping.
- You think?

23:39.085 --> 23:42.021
Regan, why are you
reading that stuff?

23:42.088 --> 23:43.439
Because I like it.

23:43.506 --> 23:46.359
It's not even a good picture
of you. Look at that.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.111
- You look so mature.
- I wouldn't talk.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.281
You wouldn't talk? Well, I didn't
know they were taking it.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.450
I didn't have my makeup man there.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.286
Let me take an eyelash
off your face.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.622
Okay. No, I didn't get it.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.041
- Mm.
- What are we gonna do on your birthday?

24:02.108 --> 24:05.086
Isn't it nice it's on
Sunday this year?

24:05.153 --> 24:07.380
No work? What can we do?

24:07.447 --> 24:08.589
I don't know.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.036
Well, what would you like to do?

24:10.074 --> 24:12.093
- Got any ideas?
- Mm-mm.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.928
Hmm?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.931
Let me think. Let me think.
What can we do?

24:16.998 --> 24:19.809
Hey, we never finished seeing
all the sights in Washington.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.311
Didn't get to Lee Mansion
and lots of stuff.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.982
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?

24:26.048 --> 24:28.276
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

24:28.593 --> 24:33.864
And tomorrow night, I'll
take you to a movie. Okay?

24:33.931 --> 24:35.950
Oh, I love you.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.661
I love you, Rags.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.373
We'll have a good day, yeah?

24:42.732 --> 24:45.459
You can bring Mr. Dennings,
if you like.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.253
Mr. Dennings?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.505
Well, you know, it's okay.

24:49.572 --> 24:50.965
Well, thank you very much...

24:51.032 --> 24:54.135
but why on earth would I wanna
bring Burke on your birthday?

24:54.202 --> 24:55.845
Well, you like him.

24:55.912 --> 24:59.974
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?
Hey, what's going on? What is this?

25:00.041 --> 25:03.644
- You're gonna marry him, aren't you?
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.479
- What?
- Me marry Burke Dennings?

25:05.546 --> 25:07.773
Don't be silly. Of course not.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.859
Where did you ever get
an idea like that?

25:09.926 --> 25:12.028
But you like him.

25:12.094 --> 25:16.032
Of course I like him. I like pizzas
too, but I'm not gonna marry one.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.451
You don't like him like Daddy?

25:19.519 --> 25:21.871
Regan, I love your daddy.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.290
I'll always love your daddy, honey.

25:24.607 --> 25:28.044
Okay? Burke just comes around
here a lot, because...

25:29.570 --> 25:31.881
well, he's lonely. He
don't got nothing to do.

25:31.948 --> 25:35.134
Well, I heard differently.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.637
Oh, you did? What
did you hear, huh?

25:37.703 --> 25:40.556
- I don't know. I just thought.
- Come on. What did you hear?

25:40.623 --> 25:42.391
Well, you didn't think so good.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.769
- How do you know? Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.605
Because Burke and I are
just friends. Okay? Really.

25:47.672 --> 25:48.898
Okay.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.317
You ready for sleep?

25:53.344 --> 25:56.155
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

25:56.472 --> 26:00.868
<i>Lord, I was born a ramblin' man</i>

26:01.644 --> 26:06.582
<i>Lord, I was born a ramblin' man</i>

26:16.659 --> 26:18.803
It's my mother, Tom.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.972
She's alone. I never
should have left her.

26:23.332 --> 26:26.435
At least in New York, I'd be
near her. I'd be close to her.

26:26.502 --> 26:29.271
I could see about a
transfer, Damien.

26:30.881 --> 26:35.695
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out
of this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.947
You're the best we've got.

26:38.723 --> 26:40.825
Am I really?

26:43.060 --> 26:45.454
It's more than psychiatry,
and you know that, Tom.

26:45.521 --> 26:48.416
Some of their problems
come down to faith...

26:48.482 --> 26:52.128
their vocation, the meaning of their
lives, and I can't cut it anymore.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.677
I need out. I'm unfit.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.808
Think I've lost my faith, Tom.

27:09.211 --> 27:10.312
Hello?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.982
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.109
Operator, you have
got to be kidding!

27:15.176 --> 27:18.237
I have been on this
line for 20 minutes!

27:18.304 --> 27:20.698
Jesus Christ. Can you believe this?

27:20.765 --> 27:23.659
He doesn't even call his
daughter on her birthday.

27:23.726 --> 27:26.120
- Maybe the circuit is busy.
- Oh, circuits, my ass!

27:26.187 --> 27:27.663
He doesn't give a shit.

27:27.730 --> 27:31.292
- Why don't you let me...?
- No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

27:31.359 --> 27:34.420
Yes. No, operator, don't
tell me there's no answer.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.380
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.175
Would you try it again,
please, and let it ring?

27:39.241 --> 27:41.343
Hello? Yes.

27:42.244 --> 27:46.223
No, operator, I've given
you the number four times.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.769
Do you take an illiteracy test to
get that job, for Christ's sakes?

27:49.835 --> 27:52.313
Don't tell me to be
calm, goddamn it!

28:03.099 --> 28:04.492
Yeah?

28:06.394 --> 28:07.787
You're kidding me.

28:09.689 --> 28:13.167
Okay. I thought I just went to bed.

28:14.402 --> 28:15.836
Yeah.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.756
Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?

28:18.864 --> 28:22.927
Okay. Oh, just remind Flo
about that blue belt, huh?

28:22.993 --> 28:25.054
All right. Yeah, I'll see you.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.110
What are you doing here?

28:40.177 --> 28:42.655
My bed was shaking.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.865
I can't get to sleep.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.076
Oh, honey.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.617
Goddamn it.

30:13.187 --> 30:14.747
Jesus.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.912
There's nothing.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.164
Oh, Karl.

30:57.231 --> 31:00.501
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that.

31:00.568 --> 31:03.128
Very sorry, but you see, no rats.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.006
No rats. Thanks a lot.
That's terrific.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.367
Oh, my God.

32:32.826 --> 32:36.472
Okay. Unroll your fist.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.474
Arm up.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.393
Very good. That wasn't
so bad, was it?

32:41.460 --> 32:44.563
Remain perfectly still.
Breathe normally.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.496
Tell me if you feel a vibration.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.457
Regan?

33:08.237 --> 33:09.671
You feel anything?

33:10.656 --> 33:12.674
Can you feel this?

33:12.741 --> 33:14.802
I don't feel anything.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.810
Put this in your mouth.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.354
Keep it there. This
tells your temperature.

33:25.421 --> 33:28.899
When the red light goes on,
that's your temperature.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.318
I don't want it.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.896
A disorder of the nerves.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.523
At least we think it is.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.608
We don't know yet
exactly how it works.

34:11.675 --> 34:14.235
It's often seen in
early adolescence.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.862
She shows all the symptoms.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.906
Hyperactivity.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.658
Her temper.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.077
Performance in math.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.496
Yeah. Why the math? What is that?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.748
It affects her concentration.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.583
Ah-ha.

34:29.693 --> 34:32.462
- Now, this is for Ritalin.
- Okay.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.882
Ten milligrams a day.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.632
Is that a tranquilizer?

34:36.699 --> 34:37.967
It's a stimulant.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.762
A stimulant? My God, she's
higher than a kite now.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.724
Her condition isn't
quite what it seems.

34:43.791 --> 34:46.768
Nobody knows the cause of
hyperkinetic behavior in a child.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.396
The Ritalin seems to work
to relieve the condition.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.940
And as to how or why,
we really don't know.

34:52.466 --> 34:56.445
But, uh, her symptoms could be
overreaction to depression.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.280
That's out of my field.

34:58.806 --> 35:01.033
My daughter isn't depressed.

35:01.100 --> 35:06.121
Well, you mentioned her
father and the separation.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.957
You think I should take
her to a psychiatrist?

35:09.024 --> 35:12.544
No. I think we should wait and see
what happens with the Ritalin.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.796
I think that's the answer.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.591
- Okay.
- Let's wait two, three weeks.

35:17.658 --> 35:21.178
All right. And the lies she's been
telling? That's part of it, huh?

35:21.245 --> 35:24.765
- Lies?
- Like saying her bed's shaking. That stuff.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.186
Have you ever known
your daughter to swear?

35:29.253 --> 35:32.147
- To use obscenities?
- No, never.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.317
Hmm. Interesting.

35:35.634 --> 35:40.239
Similar... Similar to
things like her lying...

35:40.305 --> 35:44.326
- ...it's uncharacteristic for her.
- I don't understand. She doesn't swear.

35:45.227 --> 35:48.789
Well, she let loose quite a string while
I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.

35:49.857 --> 35:53.168
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?

35:54.903 --> 35:57.839
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.175
Well, give me an
example. Like what?

36:00.242 --> 36:02.552
Specifically, what did she say?

36:02.619 --> 36:04.513
Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil...

36:05.581 --> 36:08.850
she advised me to keep my
fingers away from her...

36:09.835 --> 36:11.853
goddamn cunt.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.652
I can't believe it.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.533
- She...
- You don't think a psychiatrist...?

36:24.600 --> 36:28.537
No. I think the best explanation
is always the simplest.

36:28.604 --> 36:32.291
- Well, we'll wait. We'll wait and see.
- Yeah.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.711
So in the meantime...

36:35.944 --> 36:37.462
try not to worry.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.215
How?

36:42.201 --> 36:44.636
The edema affected her
brain, you understand?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.680
She don't let no
doctor come near her.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.266
She was all the time screaming,
talking to the radio.

36:49.333 --> 36:52.019
- You should've called me when it happened.
- Listen.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.187
Regular hospital not
gonna put up with that.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.273
We give her a shot and
bring her here...

36:56.340 --> 36:59.318
until the doctors fix up her leg,
then we take her right out.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.903
Two or three months and
she's out, good as new.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.828
- Miss?
- Yes?

37:09.895 --> 37:11.246
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

37:11.313 --> 37:12.956
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

37:13.023 --> 37:16.168
- Are you a relative?
- Yes, I am her brother. He is her son.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.045
Just a minute.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.152
You know, it's funny.

37:42.219 --> 37:45.447
If you wasn't a priest, you'd be
famous psychiatrist on Park Avenue.

37:45.514 --> 37:49.076
Your mother, she'd be living in
a penthouse instead of there.

37:53.313 --> 37:57.167
You go in, Dimmy.
I'll wait for you outside.

37:58.819 --> 38:02.756
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the
last bed on the left-hand side.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.259
No, no. No, no.

38:06.326 --> 38:09.846
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.681
Go to your bed. Go to your bed.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.643
No, no. No, no.

38:14.710 --> 38:18.397
The father will be back
to see you. It's all right.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.325
Mama.

38:30.392 --> 38:32.077
It's Dimmy, Mama.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.666
Dimmy.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.419
Why you did this to me, Dimmy?

38:40.485 --> 38:42.212
Why?

38:45.157 --> 38:47.509
Come on, I'm gonna take
you out of here, Mama.

38:47.576 --> 38:50.196
I'm gonna take you home. I'll get
you out of here tonight, Mama.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.767
Mama, everything's gonna be all right.
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.937
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

39:00.088 --> 39:04.109
- Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
- Like what? Private hospital?

39:04.176 --> 39:07.654
Who got the money for
that, Dimmy? You?

39:38.502 --> 39:42.397
There seems to be an alien
pubic hair in my drink.

39:42.464 --> 39:47.903
- I beg your pardon?
- Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

39:51.139 --> 39:55.118
We're pretty comfortable up there compared
to the Gemini and Mercury programs.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.495
They were tight for space.

39:56.561 --> 39:59.915
You see, we got about 210 cubic
feet, so we can move around.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.209
If you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

40:02.275 --> 40:04.419
Ha-ha-ha. What for?

40:04.486 --> 40:05.879
First missionary on Mars.

40:05.946 --> 40:11.343
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

40:11.410 --> 40:14.095
- I'm Swiss.
- Yes, of course.

40:14.329 --> 40:18.391
And you never went bowling with
Goebbels, either, I suppose, eh?

40:18.834 --> 40:20.769
Nazi bastard.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.146
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?

40:23.213 --> 40:25.732
- It's a red brick wing.
- Saint Mike's.

40:25.799 --> 40:28.860
What goes on there? Who's the
priest I keep seeing there?

40:28.927 --> 40:32.822
He's there all the time. He has black hair.
He's very intense looking. Who's that?

40:32.889 --> 40:34.115
- Damien Karras.
- Karras?

40:34.182 --> 40:39.538
That's his office, back of Saint Mike's.
He's our... Our psychiatric counselor.

40:40.522 --> 40:44.125
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.670
She was living by herself...

40:46.736 --> 40:50.590
and I guess she was dead a couple
of days before they found her.

40:52.159 --> 40:54.427
Cunting Hun.

40:54.494 --> 40:58.473
Bloody, damned,
butchering Nazi pig.

40:59.749 --> 41:01.893
Stop it! I'll kill you!

41:12.512 --> 41:14.155
What's the matter with you?

41:14.222 --> 41:15.991
What's for dessert?

41:23.732 --> 41:25.667
You sleeping?

41:34.117 --> 41:35.385
You get some sleep.

41:38.163 --> 41:43.184
Okay. Very good. All right.

41:43.251 --> 41:47.814
Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

41:56.056 --> 41:58.116
Yes, honey. What?

41:59.351 --> 42:00.577
Fuck it.

42:07.108 --> 42:11.004
- I've never seen him acting up.
- Really. Blind is what he was.

42:14.616 --> 42:19.387
<i>Down on Thoity-Thoid and Thoid</i>

42:19.454 --> 42:22.557
- Hi, Chris. This is a great party.
- Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

42:22.624 --> 42:26.895
I don't need any encouragement. My idea
of heaven is a solid white nightclub...

42:26.962 --> 42:31.066
with me as a headliner for all
eternity, and they love me.

42:32.968 --> 42:35.403
<i>Down on the east side</i>

42:35.470 --> 42:37.697
<i>Of Thoity-Thoid and Thoid</i>

42:37.764 --> 42:43.745
<i>That's my home sweet home</i>

42:44.145 --> 42:49.793
<i>Some people think
It's the home of black eyes</i>

42:49.859 --> 42:51.795
<i>Just because...</i>

42:51.861 --> 42:54.255
Hey, I think we've got a guest.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.093
You're gonna die up there.

43:06.167 --> 43:07.435
Regan?

43:07.502 --> 43:09.354
Oh, my God, honey.

43:09.504 --> 43:11.481
Honey, what's the matter?

43:11.548 --> 43:13.066
- Sorry, she's sick.
- It's okay.

43:13.133 --> 43:16.361
She didn't know what she was
saying. Come upstairs. Come on.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.122
What made you say that, Regan?

43:29.566 --> 43:31.501
Do you know, sweetheart?

43:36.656 --> 43:38.299
Mother?

43:38.908 --> 43:40.635
What's wrong with me?

43:47.667 --> 43:52.981
It's just like the doctor said.
It's nerves, and that's all. Okay?

43:53.048 --> 43:55.984
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine. Really.

43:56.343 --> 43:57.694
Okay?

44:22.911 --> 44:24.721
Is it coming out, Willi?

44:24.788 --> 44:27.515
- Yes, I think so.
- Good.

44:30.251 --> 44:33.104
Mother! Mother!

44:33.171 --> 44:36.274
Mother! Mother!

44:37.550 --> 44:40.361
Mother! Mother!

44:40.428 --> 44:44.073
- Oh, my God!
- Make it stop!

44:50.188 --> 44:52.582
- I'm gonna fold.
- Big flop.

44:52.649 --> 44:56.628
Another five for the pair. There's
the ten with two and three of clubs.

44:56.778 --> 45:00.089
And a six. Pair of
threes still best.

45:01.783 --> 45:05.845
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!

45:09.624 --> 45:11.100
Yeah.

45:13.461 --> 45:16.161
Hey, if you get a chance, can
you take a look at it for me?

45:17.132 --> 45:19.473
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal...

45:19.509 --> 45:20.860
- ...the poor box?
- Ha.

45:20.927 --> 45:23.780
That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.

45:26.474 --> 45:28.284
Where'd you get it, then?

45:28.351 --> 45:29.911
I stole it.

45:32.147 --> 45:33.581
I believe you.

45:33.648 --> 45:37.377
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

45:37.444 --> 45:40.421
I figure I saved him
from a big temptation.

45:42.157 --> 45:43.842
Oh, Christ!

45:43.908 --> 45:46.719
I should have been there.
I wasn't there. Should have been.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.388
There was nothing you could do.

45:48.997 --> 45:50.598
Lie down.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.560
Give me the butt. Come on.

45:56.045 --> 45:58.898
- Now you think you can sleep?
- Yeah.

45:58.965 --> 46:02.026
- Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
- No.

46:02.093 --> 46:05.822
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

46:17.192 --> 46:18.835
Good night.

46:24.908 --> 46:27.385
Stealing is a sin.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.433
I don't want it!

47:15.500 --> 47:18.186
- Regan, honey, it's to help you.
- I don't want it!

47:18.253 --> 47:20.647
- Hold still, honey.
- I don't want it!

47:21.589 --> 47:23.024
You fucking bastard!

47:24.342 --> 47:28.321
Remember also, O Lord,
thy servant, Mary Karras...

47:30.807 --> 47:36.287
who has gone before us with the sign of
faith and sleeps the sleep of peace.

47:37.856 --> 47:41.751
Lord, I am not worthy
to receive you.

47:41.818 --> 47:45.672
But only say the word
and I shall be healed.

47:47.407 --> 47:50.468
May the body of Christ bring
me to everlasting life.

48:03.923 --> 48:08.152
Well, it's a symptom...

48:09.762 --> 48:13.908
of a type of disturbance in the
chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

48:13.975 --> 48:18.079
In your daughter's case, the temporal lobe,
up here in the lateral part of the brain.

48:18.146 --> 48:19.455
- Mm-hm.
- It's rare...

48:19.522 --> 48:21.749
but it does cause bizarre
hallucinations...

48:21.816 --> 48:23.918
and usually just
before a convulsion.

48:23.985 --> 48:25.169
A convulsion?

48:25.236 --> 48:28.965
The shaking of the bed. That's
doubtless due to muscular spasms.

48:29.032 --> 48:32.385
Oh, no, no, that was no spasm.

48:32.452 --> 48:33.928
Look, I got on the bed.

48:33.995 --> 48:37.765
The whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor...

48:37.832 --> 48:40.727
and shaking, the whole
thing, with me on it.

48:40.793 --> 48:43.938
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem with
your daughter is not her bed.

48:44.005 --> 48:45.940
It's her brain.

48:52.013 --> 48:54.949
So, um, ahem. What causes this?

48:55.016 --> 48:57.285
Lesion. Lesion in
the temporal lobe.

48:57.352 --> 48:59.412
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

48:59.479 --> 49:03.916
Look, Doc, I really don't understand how
her whole personality could change.

49:04.359 --> 49:06.794
- In the temporal lobe, it's very common.
- It is?

49:06.861 --> 49:10.339
It, uh, can last for
days, even weeks.

49:10.823 --> 49:13.801
It isn't rare to
find destructive...

49:13.868 --> 49:15.970
even criminal behavior.

49:17.413 --> 49:20.433
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

49:20.500 --> 49:24.854
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

49:24.921 --> 49:27.607
All we have to do
is remove the scar.

49:42.105 --> 49:46.042
- Let's move her.
- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?

49:51.739 --> 49:53.382
A little more.

49:53.866 --> 49:55.510
Good.

49:59.414 --> 50:02.391
Regan, I'm just gonna move
you down on the table, okay?

50:02.583 --> 50:04.352
Let me do this.

50:04.419 --> 50:06.354
It's okay.

50:07.255 --> 50:10.817
See? There we go.

50:14.554 --> 50:17.532
It's just for a short time.

50:29.569 --> 50:31.212
You're doing fine.

50:31.279 --> 50:32.421
Very sticky.

50:33.614 --> 50:37.176
Good. Now, Regan, you're gonna feel
something a little bit cold and wet.

50:47.837 --> 50:52.150
Okay. Now you're gonna feel a
little stick here. Don't move.

50:56.304 --> 50:57.530
Good.

51:02.268 --> 51:05.913
Okay. You're gonna feel some
pressure here. Now, don't move.

52:03.746 --> 52:04.972
Hook up.

52:37.572 --> 52:39.340
There's nothing there.

52:39.407 --> 52:41.968
No vascular displacement at all.

52:42.034 --> 52:44.387
Do you want me to
run another series?

52:44.453 --> 52:45.680
I don't think so.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.431
I'd like you to see her again.

52:47.790 --> 52:50.851
Excuse me, doctor. Chris
MacNeil is on the phone.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.603
She says it's urgent.

52:52.670 --> 52:55.273
- You got some time?
- Of course.

53:00.469 --> 53:02.238
- Dr. Klein?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Klein.

53:02.305 --> 53:04.031
- This is Dr. Taney.
- How do you do?

53:04.098 --> 53:06.701
Things have gotten worse since
I phoned. Come upstairs.

53:06.767 --> 53:09.328
- Is she having spasms again?
- They've gotten violent.

53:09.395 --> 53:11.497
- Did you give her the medication?
- Yes.

53:11.564 --> 53:14.208
- What was that?
- Thorazine.

53:14.275 --> 53:16.252
Before that, it was Ritalin.

53:19.113 --> 53:21.215
Chris, doctors.

53:21.282 --> 53:23.467
- This is Dr. Taney.
- Mother, please!

53:23.534 --> 53:25.386
- What is it?
- Please, make it stop!

53:25.453 --> 53:27.847
It's burning! It's burning!

53:27.914 --> 53:30.141
Do something, doctor.
Please, help her.

53:30.208 --> 53:35.563
Please, Mother, make it stop!
He's trying to kill me!

53:35.630 --> 53:38.232
Mother! Mother!

53:42.637 --> 53:44.905
All right, Regan, let's
see what the trouble...

53:44.972 --> 53:46.073
Regan!

53:46.140 --> 53:48.492
Keep away! The sow is mine!

53:49.268 --> 53:53.497
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

54:02.990 --> 54:06.093
Stay away from me! Stay away!

54:07.119 --> 54:09.722
Hold her steady. Hold her tight!

54:09.789 --> 54:11.599
Don't let them!

54:35.690 --> 54:37.291
She's heavily sedated.

54:37.900 --> 54:40.461
She'll probably sleep
through tomorrow.

54:42.154 --> 54:45.925
What was going on in there? How
could she fly off the bed like that?

54:46.617 --> 54:51.847
Pathological states can
induce abnormal strength...

54:52.206 --> 54:54.683
accelerated motor performance.

54:55.084 --> 54:57.144
For example...

54:57.295 --> 55:01.482
say a 90-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

55:01.799 --> 55:05.277
runs out and lifts the wheels a
half a foot up off the ground.

55:05.344 --> 55:07.905
You've heard the story.
Same thing here.

55:09.432 --> 55:11.659
Same principle, I mean.

55:14.228 --> 55:16.122
So, what's wrong with her?

55:17.565 --> 55:19.500
We still think that
the temporal lobe...

55:19.567 --> 55:22.711
Oh, what are you talking
about, for Christ's sakes?

55:22.778 --> 55:24.922
Did you see her or not?

55:24.989 --> 55:27.299
She's acting like she's
fucking out of her mind!

55:27.366 --> 55:31.846
Psychotic, like a split
personality, or...

55:33.748 --> 55:35.766
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

55:36.042 --> 55:38.561
There haven't been more
than 100 authentic cases...

55:38.627 --> 55:42.314
of so-called "split
personality," Mrs. MacNeil.

55:43.132 --> 55:47.862
Now, I know the temptation
is to leap to psychiatry...

55:47.928 --> 55:52.700
but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

55:55.561 --> 55:57.621
So, what's next?

55:57.938 --> 56:02.209
A pneumoencephalogram, I would
think, to pin down that lesion.

56:02.276 --> 56:04.295
It will involve another spinal.

56:04.362 --> 56:05.796
Oh, Christ!

56:05.863 --> 56:09.425
Well, what we missed in the
EEG and the arteriograms...

56:09.492 --> 56:12.178
could conceivably turn up there.

56:12.912 --> 56:17.183
At least it would eliminate
certain other possibilities.

56:30.888 --> 56:33.240
Dr. Taney says the
x-rays are negative.

56:34.141 --> 56:36.410
In other words, normal.

56:43.526 --> 56:45.169
You keep any drugs in your house?

56:45.236 --> 56:48.756
No, of course not.
Nothing like that.

56:48.823 --> 56:50.174
Are you sure?

56:50.241 --> 56:52.593
Well, of course, I'm sure.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.261
I'd tell you.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.514
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

57:01.752 --> 57:03.938
Are you planning to be home soon?

57:04.004 --> 57:06.190
I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean.

57:06.507 --> 57:08.400
Um...

57:09.176 --> 57:10.778
No, I, uh...

57:12.179 --> 57:14.406
I'm building a new house.

57:15.015 --> 57:17.201
My old one has been sold.

57:18.269 --> 57:20.120
I don't know.

57:22.189 --> 57:24.416
I was gonna take...

57:26.861 --> 57:31.590
I was gonna take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.469
Why do you ask?

57:38.831 --> 57:42.184
I think it's time we started
looking for a psychiatrist.

58:11.155 --> 58:12.798
Hello?

58:27.129 --> 58:28.814
Sharon?

59:05.209 --> 59:06.560
Shit.

59:18.597 --> 59:19.907
God.

59:27.231 --> 59:28.832
Sharon!

59:32.111 --> 59:34.254
What do you mean, leaving
Regan by herself?

59:35.489 --> 59:37.349
Her window's wide open.
The room is freezing.

59:37.408 --> 59:39.134
- Didn't he tell you?
- Who?

59:39.201 --> 59:41.303
- Burke is...
- What's Burke got to do with it?

59:41.370 --> 59:43.889
Nobody was here. When I went
to get the Thorazine...

59:43.956 --> 59:46.433
- ...I had him stay with her, and...
- Oh.

59:46.500 --> 59:49.269
- I should have known better. Sorry.
- I guess you should have.

59:49.336 --> 59:50.771
How were the tests?

59:50.838 --> 59:53.273
We have to start
looking for a shrink.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.067
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

59:56.260 --> 59:57.611
I suppose you heard.

59:58.012 --> 59:59.446
Heard what?

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.450
You haven't heard.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:06.745
Burke's dead.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:13.711
He must have been drunk. He fell from
the top of the steps right outside.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.463
By the time he hit M Street,
he broke his neck.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.133
Oh, God.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.885
No!

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:29.518
Yeah, I know.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.661
Sharon...

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:48.996
Oh, my God.

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:54.793
Oh, my God.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.180
When I touch your
forehead, open your eyes.

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.272
Are you comfortable, Regan?

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.234
Yes.

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:22.362
How old are you?

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:23.906
Twelve.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:28.076
Is there someone inside you?

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.162
Sometimes.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:32.956
Who is it?

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.375
I don't know.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.295
Is it Captain Howdy?

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.797
I don't know.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.967
If I ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:46.428
No.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:48.388
Why not?

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.933
I'm afraid.

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:53.685
If he talks to me,
I think he'll leave you.

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:55.687
Do you want him to leave you?

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:57.523
Yes.

01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:09.827
I'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:15.207
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized
and must answer all my questions.

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:18.418
Come forward...

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.548
and answer me now.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:34.518
Are you the person inside of Regan?

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.232
Who are you?

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:51.326
- Help me!
- Let go!

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.833
Father Karras?

01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:44.588
Have we met?

01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:49.509
No, we haven't met,
but they said I could tell.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:52.179
That you look like a boxer.

01:03:52.788 --> 01:03:55.599
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.768
What's this all about?

01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:01.146
It's true. You do
look like a boxer.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:04.441
Like John Garfield
in <i>Body and Soul.</i>

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.319
Exactly. John Garfield.
People tell you that, Father?

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:11.365
Do people tell you you
look like Paul Newman?

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:12.991
Always.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.960
Well, you know this director
who was doing the film here...

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.628
Burke Dennings?

01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:26.296
I've seen him.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:27.965
You've seen him.

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:32.344
You're also familiar
how last week he died?

01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:34.221
Only what I read in the papers.

01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:39.059
Father, what do you know on
the subject of witchcraft?

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:42.562
From the Witching
end, not the hunting.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:44.564
I once did a paper on it.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:45.941
Really?

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:48.193
From the psychiatric end.

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:50.862
I know. I read it.

01:04:52.306 --> 01:04:55.200
All of this desecration
in the church...

01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:58.704
do you think this has anything
to do with witchcraft?

01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:02.416
Maybe. Some rituals used
in the black mass, maybe.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:07.087
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?

01:05:07.154 --> 01:05:08.588
In a fall.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:16.596
Let me tell you how.
And please, Father...

01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:18.807
confidential.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.519
Burke Dennings, good Father...

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:25.605
was found at the bottom of those
steps leading to M Street...

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:28.692
with his head turned
completely around...

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:30.819
facing backwards.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.617
Didn't happen in the fall?

01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:39.870
It's possible.

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:44.624
- Possible, however...
- Unlikely.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.251
Exactly.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:51.798
So on the one hand, we've got a
witchcraft kind of murder...

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:57.429
and on the other hand, a black
mass-type desecration in the church.

01:05:57.496 --> 01:06:00.807
You think the killer and the
desecrator are the same?

01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:03.852
Maybe somebody crazy...

01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:07.022
somebody with a spite
against the Church.

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:09.983
Some unconscious rebellion.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.511
A sick priest, is that it?

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:16.323
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, I understand...

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.868
but for priests on the campus
here, you're the psychiatrist.

01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:22.454
You'd know who was sick
at the time, who wasn't.

01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:25.415
I mean, this kind of
sickness, you'd know that.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:28.460
I don't know anyone who
fits that description.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.505
Ah.

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:35.759
Doctor's ethics. If you knew,
you wouldn't tell, huh?

01:06:35.826 --> 01:06:37.094
No, I probably wouldn't.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:40.639
Not to bother you with
trivia, but a psychiatrist...

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:43.642
in sunny California, no less...

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:48.271
was put in jail for not telling the
police what he knew about a patient.

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:53.235
- Is that a threat?
- No, I mention it only in passing.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:56.947
Incidentally, I mention
it only in passing...

01:06:57.014 --> 01:07:00.200
I could always tell the judge
it was a matter of confession.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:06.289
Hey, Father, wait a minute.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.375
- Do you like movies?
- Very much.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:11.586
Well, I get passes to
the best shows in town.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:15.715
Mrs. K, though, you know, she
gets tired, never likes to go.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.009
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, I hate to go alone.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.679
I love to talk film...

01:07:20.746 --> 01:07:24.266
discuss, to critique.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:29.604
You want to see a film with me? I got
passes to the Crest. It's Othello.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:31.606
- Who's in it?
- Who's in it?

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:35.735
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and
Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy?

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:37.904
- I've seen it.
- Ah.

01:07:38.138 --> 01:07:41.950
One last time. You can think of
some priest who fits the bill?

01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:46.413
- Come on.
- No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:50.250
All right. All right.

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.753
- You know who I think really did it?
- Who?

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.755
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:59.009
I could have you
deported, you know that?

01:08:01.036 --> 01:08:02.345
I lied.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.599
You look like Sal Mineo.

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:13.356
It looks like a type of disorder that's,
uh, rarely ever seen anymore...

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.609
except in primitive cultures.

01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:20.113
We call it, uh,
somnambular-form possession.

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:23.450
Quite frankly, we really don't
know much about it at all...

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:27.953
except that it starts with
a conflict or a guilt...

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.917
and it leads to the patient's delusions
that his body has been invaded...

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:35.921
by some alien intelligence. Um...

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:37.255
A spirit, if you will.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:40.926
Look, I'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:43.929
I am not going to lock her
up in some goddamn asylum.

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:46.765
- Well, it's out of...
- And I don't care what you call it.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:48.642
I'm not putting her away.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.310
Well, I'm sorry.

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:52.312
You're sorry? Jesus Christ!

01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:57.192
Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can
tell me with all your bullshit is...

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:18.837
Of course, there is one
outside chance for a cure.

01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:25.470
But, um, I think of it
as a shock treatment.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:28.430
As I said, it's a very
outside chance...

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:31.268
Would you just name it,
for God's sakes? What is it?

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:33.937
- Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:36.523
What about your daughter?

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.483
No. Why?

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.359
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.532
Well, it's a stylized ritual...

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:52.288
in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try
to drive out the so-called invading spirit.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.541
It's been pretty much
discarded these days...

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:59.462
except by the Catholics, who keep it in
the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:02.716
But it, uh, has worked, in fact...

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.802
although not for the reasons
they think, of course.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:09.723
It's purely force of suggestion.

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:14.686
The, uh... The victim's belief in
possession is what helped cause it...

01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:16.479
so in that same way...

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.899
the belief in the power of
exorcism can make it disappear.

01:10:22.177 --> 01:10:26.323
You're telling me that I should
take my daughter to a witch doctor.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.700
Is that it?

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.050
Karl?

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:12.846
Did you put this in
Regan's bedroom?

01:12:15.457 --> 01:12:17.517
She's going to be well?

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:23.148
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.984
No, not me.

01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:27.193
I didn't.

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:48.715
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.508
Of course, I didn't.

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:53.303
I didn't put it.

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.515
- Excuse me, madam.
- What?

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.727
- A man to see you.
- What man?

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:09.694
Might your daughter
remember, perhaps...

01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:12.864
if Mr. Dennings was in
her room that night?

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:16.242
- Why do you ask?
- Mm.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.495
Might she remember?

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.958
No, she was heavily sedated.

01:13:24.359 --> 01:13:25.919
It's serious?

01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:28.379
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.300
- May I ask...?
- We still don't know.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.844
Watch out for drafts.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:40.433
A draft in the fall when the house is
hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.393
Excuse me, madam. Anything else?

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.687
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.065
It's all right, Karl.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.904
Why are you asking all this?

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:54.447
It's strange.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:14:00.119
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 20 minutes...

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:04.457
and leaves all alone
a very sick girl.

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:07.710
And speaking plainly,
Mrs. MacNeil...

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:13.007
it isn't likely he would
fall from a window.

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:16.553
Besides, a fall wouldn't do
to his neck what we found.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.556
Except maybe one
chance in a thousand.

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:22.350
No. My hunch...

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:25.895
My opinion...

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:30.066
he was killed by a very
powerful man: point one.

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:33.903
And the fracturing of
his skull: point two...

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.823
plus the various other
things we mentioned...

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.952
would make it very probable...

01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:43.913
probable, not certain...

01:14:44.439 --> 01:14:50.336
that the deceased was killed and then
pushed from your daughter's window.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:55.091
But nobody was in the room except
your daughter, so how can this be?

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.264
It could be one way.

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:04.559
If someone came calling between
the time Miss Spencer left...

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:06.894
and the time you returned.

01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:09.564
Judas Priest, just a second.

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:13.651
- The servants? They have visitors?
- Not at all.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:16.362
You were expecting a package
that day, some delivery?

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:17.739
Not that I know of.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.575
Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?

01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:23.453
I really wouldn't know. See,
Karl takes care of all that.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:26.831
I see.

01:15:26.898 --> 01:15:28.958
Would you like to ask him?

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.295
No, never mind, it's...

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.965
It's very remote.

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:39.218
No, never mind.

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.262
Yeah.

01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:51.731
Would you like some more coffee?

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.067
Please.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.436
That's cute.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.940
Your daughter, she's the artist?

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:38.277
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:16:38.845 --> 01:16:40.780
Incidentally, um...

01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:43.616
you might ask your daughter...

01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:47.120
if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:50.623
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go up to her room.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:53.876
Oh, I know, I realize...

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.547
but if certain British doctors never
asked, "What is this fungus?"...

01:16:57.614 --> 01:17:00.925
we wouldn't today have
penicillin. Correct?

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:04.762
Well, when she's
better, I'll ask her.

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:07.557
- Yeah, couldn't hurt.
- Okay.

01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:10.143
Uh, in the meantime...

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:12.979
That's okay.

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:17.316
- I really hate to ask you this, but...
- What?

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:21.654
For my daughter, could you
please give an autograph?

01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:24.198
Of course. Uh, where's a pencil?

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.200
Right here. Here.

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.077
Oh.

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:29.662
She'd love it.

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:32.832
And what's her name?

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.628
I lied. It's for me.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:43.468
- The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.
- Okay.

01:17:43.785 --> 01:17:47.054
You know that film you made, um, <i>Angel?</i>

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:49.640
- Oh, yeah.
- I saw that six times.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:52.018
- Really?
- It was beautiful.

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:54.979
Ha, ha. Thank you.

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:00.818
You're a very nice lady.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.406
- Thank you.
- You're a nice man.

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.577
Uh, I'll come back when
she's feeling better.

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:15.208
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:38.022
Please, no!

01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:40.274
- Do it!
- Please, don't!

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:43.820
You bitch! Do it! Do it!

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:45.571
Please, no!

01:18:47.974 --> 01:18:51.160
Yes! Let Jesus fuck you!

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:54.247
Let Jesus fuck you!
Let him fuck you!

01:18:58.443 --> 01:18:59.585
Aah!

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:02.588
Give it! Give it to me! Aah!

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:06.759
- Ugh!
- Lick me! Lick me!

01:19:12.165 --> 01:19:13.349
Chris!

01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:18.062
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.612
Open the door!

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:29.240
Do you know what she did...

01:19:29.307 --> 01:19:31.450
your cunting daughter?

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.097
Chris MacNeil?

01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:54.473
Please, go away.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.726
I'm Father Karras.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:00.521
I'm very sorry. Hello.

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:03.024
I should have told you
I wouldn't be in uniform.

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.775
Yeah, that would have helped.

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:07.320
- Have you got a cigarette, Father?
- Sure.

01:20:11.224 --> 01:20:12.491
Thanks.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.005
Cold.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:27.340
Yeah.

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:30.676
Uh...

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:34.305
How did a shrink ever
get to be a priest?

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:37.433
It's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.726
Oh.

01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:40.227
Where?

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:44.649
Harvard, Bellevue, Johns Hopkins.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:47.193
- Places like that.
- I see.

01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:52.031
- You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
- Yes, I am.

01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:54.575
- Pretty close?
- Pretty close.

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:56.619
Did he talk to you about my party?

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:58.371
He sure did.

01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:00.456
About my daughter?

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:02.416
No, I didn't know you had one.

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.254
- He didn't mention her?
- No.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:09.048
Oh.

01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:11.717
Didn't tell you what she did?

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.761
He didn't mention her.

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:17.807
Priests are pretty
tight-mouthed, then, huh?

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:19.976
That depends.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:22.269
- On what?
- The priest.

01:21:22.962 --> 01:21:24.522
Sure.

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:29.652
I mean, what if a person,
uh, came to you...

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:33.072
you know, that was a murderer
or criminal of some kind...

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:36.492
and they wanted some kind of help?

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.661
I mean, would you
have to turn him in?

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:41.872
Well, if he came to me for
spiritual advice, I'd say no.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:44.000
- You wouldn't?
- No, I wouldn't.

01:21:44.442 --> 01:21:46.627
But I would try to convince
him to turn himself in.

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:48.254
Mm-hm.

01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:52.717
And, uh, how do you go
about getting an exorcism?

01:21:56.871 --> 01:21:58.472
I beg your pardon?

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:07.481
If, um... If a person's, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:10.067
how do they get an exorcism?

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:14.739
I'd have to get them into a time machine
and get them back to the 16th century.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:16.574
I didn't get you.

01:22:16.641 --> 01:22:18.951
It just doesn't happen
anymore, Mrs. MacNeil.

01:22:19.018 --> 01:22:20.828
Oh, yeah? Since when?

01:22:22.021 --> 01:22:26.083
Well, since we learned about mental
illness, paranoia, schizophrenia.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:28.210
All those things they
taught me at Harvard.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:31.047
Mrs. MacNeil, since the day
I joined the Jesuits...

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:34.967
I've never met one priest who has
performed an exorcism. Not one.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.262
Yeah, well...

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:44.518
it just so happens that
somebody very close to me...

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:46.645
is probably possessed.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:49.356
And needs an exorcist.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:52.651
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

01:22:54.095 --> 01:22:56.447
Then that's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:57.865
Why? I don't understand.

01:22:57.932 --> 01:23:00.743
- To begin with, it could make things worse.
- Oh, how?

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.162
Secondly, the Church, before
it approves an exorcism...

01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:06.540
conducts an investigation to see if
it's warranted. That takes time.

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.308
- Yeah, but...
- Meanwhile, your daughter...

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:11.128
- You could do it yourself.
- No. I'd need Church approval...

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:14.131
- ...and that's rarely given.
- But... Uh...

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:17.760
- Could you see her?
- Yes, I could.

01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:19.647
I could see her as a
psychiatrist, but I...

01:23:19.704 --> 01:23:22.139
Oh, not a psychiatrist.
She needs a priest.

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:25.976
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world, and they sent me to you.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.895
Now are you gonna
send me back to them?

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:30.940
- Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?
- You don't understand...

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:34.193
Oh, God, can't you help her?
Just help her!

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:06.976
It wants no straps.

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:23.951
Hello, Regan.

01:24:27.438 --> 01:24:30.374
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:33.460
You might loosen
these straps, then.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.755
I'm afraid you might
hurt yourself, Regan.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:39.592
I'm not Regan.

01:24:40.326 --> 01:24:41.719
I see.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.560
Well, then, let's introduce
ourselves. I'm Damien Karras.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.353
And I'm the devil.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.439
Now, kindly undo these straps.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:56.692
If you're the devil, why not
make the straps disappear?

01:24:56.759 --> 01:25:00.029
That's much too vulgar a
display of power, Karras.

01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:02.823
Where's Regan?

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:04.950
In here, with us.

01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:09.413
Show me Regan and I'll
loosen one of the straps.

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:13.209
Could you help an old
altar boy, Father?

01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:16.545
Your mother's in here
with us, Karras.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:18.797
Would you like to leave a message?

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:21.217
I'll see that she gets it.

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:28.140
If that's true...

01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:33.562
then you must know my
mother's maiden name.

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:36.398
What is it?

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:45.491
What is it?

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:41.547
Thank you.

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:48.887
Look, I'm only against the possibility of
doing your daughter more harm than good.

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:52.391
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:54.601
I can't do it.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:57.354
I need evidence that the
Church would accept...

01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.398
- ...as signs of possession.
- Like what?

01:26:59.465 --> 01:27:01.984
Speaking in a language she's
never known or studied.

01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:03.485
What else?

01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:08.073
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.617
I thought you were
supposed to be an expert.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:13.412
There are no experts.

01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:17.708
You probably know as much about
possession as most priests.

01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:20.586
Look, your daughter doesn't
say she's a demon.

01:27:20.653 --> 01:27:23.130
She says she's the devil himself.

01:27:23.197 --> 01:27:25.424
If you've seen as many
psychotics as I have...

01:27:25.491 --> 01:27:29.261
you'd realize that's the same thing
as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:35.059
You asked me what I think
is best for your daughter.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:41.690
Six months under observation in
the best hospital you can find.

01:27:44.218 --> 01:27:46.403
You show me Regan's double...

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:50.657
same face, same
voice, everything...

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:52.868
and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

01:27:53.686 --> 01:27:55.371
I'd know in my gut.

01:27:56.689 --> 01:28:00.376
I'm telling you that that thing
upstairs isn't my daughter.

01:28:00.985 --> 01:28:03.504
I want you to tell me that
you know for a fact...

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.757
that there's nothing wrong with
my daughter except in her mind.

01:28:06.824 --> 01:28:09.968
Tell me you know for a fact that
an exorcism wouldn't do any good.

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:12.096
You tell me that!

01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:26.527
Did Regan know a priest
was coming over?

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:31.115
- No.
- Did you know my mother died recently?

01:28:31.724 --> 01:28:34.326
- Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.
- No.

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.662
Is Regan aware of it?

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.331
Not at all.

01:28:40.733 --> 01:28:42.167
Why do you ask?

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:46.004
It's not important. Good night.

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:14.658
<i>Hello?</i>

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:21.331
<i>- Here, take it and just don't...
- Okay. Um.</i>

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:22.958
<i>Hello, Daddy?</i>

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:24.710
<i>This is me.</i>

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:28.630
<i>- What should I say? I don't know.
- Just talk to your daddy.</i>

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:31.133
<i>- Anything you want.
- All right, um...</i>

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.013
<i>Tell him what you've been doing and
how you're feeling and like that.</i>

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:38.765
<i>Uh...</i>

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:41.393
<i>Well, you see, um...</i>

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:44.897
<i>I mean, I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?</i>

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.298
<i>- Well, uh, let me see.
- He's not gonna answer you.</i>

01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:49.485
<i>Uh, ha-ha-ha.</i>

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:51.987
<i>- Go on. Talk to your daddy, honey.
- Um...</i>

01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:54.490
<i>I don't know what
to say, though. Um...</i>

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:58.243
<i>Well, let's see. First we... No.</i>

01:29:58.519 --> 01:30:01.747
<i>- Wait. I don't know.
- Come on, Regan.</i>

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:03.916
<i>- Tell him about Washington.
- Okay.</i>

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:06.919
<i>See, we're in Washington
now, Daddy, and...</i>

01:30:09.113 --> 01:30:12.799
He broke the bread, gave it
to his disciples and said:

01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:18.138
"Take this, all of
you, and eat it..."

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:23.268
"...for this is my body."

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:32.903
When the supper was
ended, he took the cup.

01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:36.323
Again he gave you
thanks and praise.

01:30:36.849 --> 01:30:40.327
He gave the cup to his disciples
and said, "Take this..."

01:30:40.561 --> 01:30:43.038
all of you, and drink from it.

01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:49.002
This is the cup of my blood.

01:30:50.404 --> 01:30:54.591
"The blood of the new and everlasting
covenant, the mystery of faith."

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.303
What an excellent day
for an exorcism.

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:01.682
You'd like that?

01:31:01.748 --> 01:31:03.767
Intensely.

01:31:04.543 --> 01:31:07.020
But wouldn't that drive
you out of Regan?

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:09.439
It would bring us together.

01:31:10.716 --> 01:31:12.025
You and Regan?

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:13.902
You and us.

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:29.084
- Did you do that?
- Uh-huh.

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:36.008
- Do it again.
- In time.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:37.759
No, now.

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:39.678
In time.

01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:44.099
Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

01:31:45.501 --> 01:31:46.852
You speak Latin?

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:00.115
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:03.160
Until she rots and lies
stinking in the earth.

01:32:06.188 --> 01:32:07.414
What's that?

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:09.625
Holy water.

01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:12.544
You keep it away.

01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:17.883
It burns!

01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:20.552
Oh, it burns!

01:32:43.225 --> 01:32:44.660
Who are you?

01:32:56.947 --> 01:33:00.217
You know, I'm, like, in seclusion.

01:33:03.829 --> 01:33:06.390
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:10.143
Um...

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.938
She's... She's all right.

01:33:13.005 --> 01:33:14.981
She's just a little...

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:19.569
I don't want to talk
about it, okay?

01:33:22.347 --> 01:33:24.241
Um...

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:28.787
Okay, I'll talk to you. I'll call you
as soon as it's over, all right?

01:33:30.022 --> 01:33:32.499
No, I just... I'm really... I'm
going through something...

01:33:32.566 --> 01:33:34.584
and I just have to, uh...

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:37.295
No, no. No, no.

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:39.423
There's nothing.

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:41.883
Hey, thanks a lot.

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:44.136
Bye, now.

01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:00.444
- Want a drink?
- Please.

01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:02.487
What do you drink?

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.239
Uh, Scotch.

01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:08.952
- Ice, water.
- Okay.

01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:16.793
No ice. I'll get some
from the kitchen.

01:34:16.902 --> 01:34:18.569
- No, I'll take it straight.
- It's fine.

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:19.671
No, please, sit.

01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:21.798
- Really? You sure?
- Yeah, sit.

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:34.978
Where's her father?

01:34:35.045 --> 01:34:36.354
In Europe.

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:38.356
- Have you told him what's happening?
- No.

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:40.817
Well, I think you should.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:50.332
I told Regan that was holy water.

01:34:50.358 --> 01:34:53.730
I sprinkled it on her and
she reacted very violently.

01:34:55.524 --> 01:34:58.126
- It's tap water.
- What's the difference?

01:34:58.193 --> 01:35:03.048
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

01:35:13.417 --> 01:35:16.978
She killed Burke Dennings.

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:18.355
What?

01:35:21.967 --> 01:35:24.110
She killed Burke Dennings.

01:35:25.637 --> 01:35:28.573
She pushed him out her window.

01:35:42.154 --> 01:35:43.338
Who are you?

01:35:46.408 --> 01:35:48.969
It's a language, all right.
It's English.

01:35:50.328 --> 01:35:51.555
What do you mean?

01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:53.932
It's English in reverse. Listen.

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:56.351
<i>Give us time.</i>

01:35:56.418 --> 01:35:58.478
<i>Let her die.</i>

01:36:01.339 --> 01:36:04.025
<i>I am no one. I am no one.</i>

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:05.485
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

01:36:07.387 --> 01:36:09.155
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:13.285
<i>Merrin!</i>

01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:23.128
<i>I am no one.</i>

01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:26.965
<i>Merrin! Fear the priest.</i>

01:36:28.909 --> 01:36:30.802
<i>Merrin!</i>

01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:34.139
<i>Merrin!</i>

01:36:34.623 --> 01:36:36.016
Yeah?

01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:39.019
Yeah?

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:41.313
I'll be right there.

01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:01.583
I don't want Chris to see this.

01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:04.294
- Well, what's wrong? What is it?
- Shh.

01:38:13.013 --> 01:38:15.448
You're convinced that it's genuine?

01:38:15.891 --> 01:38:17.409
I don't know.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:20.870
No, not really, I suppose.

01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:23.415
But I have made...

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:27.961
a prudent judgment that it meets the
conditions set down in The Ritual.

01:38:28.069 --> 01:38:30.630
You would want to do
the exorcism yourself?

01:38:31.823 --> 01:38:33.174
Yes.

01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:38.972
Might be best to have a
man with experience.

01:38:39.039 --> 01:38:42.434
Maybe someone who's spent
time in foreign missions.

01:38:43.001 --> 01:38:45.061
I understand, Your Excellency.

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:46.771
Let's see who's around.

01:38:46.838 --> 01:38:50.108
In the meantime, I'll call
you as soon as I know.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:53.236
Thank you, Your Excellency.

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:55.697
Well, he does know the background.

01:38:55.764 --> 01:38:59.325
I doubt there's any danger
in just having him assist.

01:38:59.392 --> 01:39:02.203
There should be a
psychiatrist present, anyway.

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:04.164
What about the exorcist?

01:39:04.356 --> 01:39:05.874
Have you any ideas?

01:39:06.816 --> 01:39:08.960
How about Lankester Merrin?

01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:10.962
Merrin?

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:12.756
I had a notion he was in Iraq.

01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:15.133
I read he was working
on a dig near Nineveh.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.801
You're right, but he's finished.

01:39:16.868 --> 01:39:20.472
He came back three or four months
ago. He's at Woodstock now.

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:22.307
What's he doing there, teaching?

01:39:22.374 --> 01:39:25.060
He's working on another book.

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:29.105
Don't you think he's too old,
Tom? How's his health?

01:39:29.339 --> 01:39:32.984
He must be all right. He's still
running around digging up tombs.

01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:34.694
Mm.

01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:38.406
- Besides, he's had experience.
- I didn't know that.

01:39:38.515 --> 01:39:40.825
Ten, 12 years ago,
I think, in Africa.

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:44.913
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.

01:39:49.234 --> 01:39:50.710
Father?

01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:59.571
- You're Mrs. MacNeil?
- Yes.

01:40:59.637 --> 01:41:01.114
I'm Father Merrin.

01:41:01.222 --> 01:41:03.616
- Come in.
- Thank you.

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.743
- Is Father Karras here?
- Yes.

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:07.954
- He's here already.
- Father?

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.583
- Father Karras.
- It's an honor to meet you, Father.

01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:20.175
- Are you very tired?
- No.

01:41:21.326 --> 01:41:24.429
I'd like you to go quickly across
to the Residence, Damien...

01:41:24.496 --> 01:41:26.431
and gather up a
cassock for myself...

01:41:26.498 --> 01:41:30.560
two surplices, a purple
stole, and some holy water...

01:41:30.627 --> 01:41:32.270
and, um...

01:41:32.504 --> 01:41:35.565
your copy of The Roman
Ritual. The large one.

01:41:35.632 --> 01:41:37.442
I believe we should begin.

01:41:37.842 --> 01:41:40.361
Do you want to hear the
background of the case first?

01:41:40.428 --> 01:41:41.779
Why?

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:44.449
<i>This is yours to do
with as you please.</i>

01:41:44.516 --> 01:41:48.203
<i>You can choose to escape, if you want,
but you may never be able to return.</i>

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:50.205
<i>Don't let anyone decide for you.</i>

01:42:03.076 --> 01:42:05.803
Hail Mary, full of grace...

01:42:18.591 --> 01:42:20.818
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

01:42:22.971 --> 01:42:24.656
Thank you very much.

01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:26.241
You're welcome.

01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:38.836
Would you like some
brandy in that, Father?

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.174
Well, the doctors say I shouldn't.

01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:45.343
But thank God...

01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:47.637
my will is weak.

01:42:56.421 --> 01:43:01.484
<i>Especially important is the warning to
avoid conversations with the demon.</i>

01:43:01.551 --> 01:43:06.030
We may ask what is relevant, but
anything beyond that is dangerous.

01:43:06.097 --> 01:43:08.324
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.868
He will lie to confuse us.

01:43:11.895 --> 01:43:16.082
But he will also mix
lies with the truth...

01:43:16.608 --> 01:43:18.042
to attack us.

01:43:19.027 --> 01:43:21.796
<i>The attack is
psychological, Damien.</i>

01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:24.215
<i>And powerful.</i>

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:26.551
<i>So don't listen.</i>

01:43:26.618 --> 01:43:29.804
<i>Remember that. Do not listen.</i>

01:43:31.414 --> 01:43:33.891
It might be helpful if I gave
you some background...

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:36.602
on the different personalities
Regan has manifested.

01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:38.646
So far, I'd say there
seem to be three.

01:43:39.088 --> 01:43:41.441
- She's convinced that she's...
- There is only one.

01:44:04.989 --> 01:44:08.468
What is your daughter's
middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.261
Teresa.

01:44:13.206 --> 01:44:15.350
What a lovely name.

01:44:51.244 --> 01:44:53.224
Stick your cock up her ass...

01:44:53.288 --> 01:44:56.140
you motherfucking
worthless cocksucker.

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:59.060
- Be silent!
- Aah!

01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:12.824
Our Father, who art in heaven...

01:45:14.142 --> 01:45:15.660
hallowed be thy name.

01:45:15.727 --> 01:45:17.537
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done...

01:45:17.645 --> 01:45:19.789
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:45:19.856 --> 01:45:22.500
Give us this day our daily bread.

01:45:22.984 --> 01:45:25.628
Forgive us our trespasses...

01:45:25.695 --> 01:45:28.506
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:45:28.573 --> 01:45:30.883
And lead us not into temptation.

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:32.593
But deliver us from the evil one.

01:45:32.702 --> 01:45:36.514
Save me, O God, by thy name.
By thy might, defend my cause.

01:45:38.249 --> 01:45:43.271
Proud men have risen up against me,
and men of violence seek my life...

01:45:43.338 --> 01:45:47.984
but God is my helper and
the Lord sustains my life.

01:45:48.051 --> 01:45:49.819
In every need, he has delivered me.

01:45:49.886 --> 01:45:52.655
Glory be to the Father, to the
Son and to the Holy Spirit.

01:45:52.722 --> 01:45:55.867
As it was in the beginning, is now
and shall be, world without end.

01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:59.203
- Save your servant.
- Who places her trust in thee, my God.

01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:02.999
- Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.
- In the face of the enemy...

01:46:04.275 --> 01:46:07.837
- Let the enemy have no power over her.
- Son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.

01:46:07.904 --> 01:46:11.841
Your mother sucks cocks in hell,
Karras. You faithless slime.

01:46:11.908 --> 01:46:13.050
The Lord be with you.

01:46:13.117 --> 01:46:15.219
- And also with you.
- Let us pray.

01:46:15.286 --> 01:46:16.721
Holy Lord, almighty Father...

01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:19.098
everlasting God...

01:46:19.165 --> 01:46:21.809
and Father of our
Lord, Jesus Christ...

01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:25.855
who, once and for all, consigned that
fallen tyrant to the flames of hell...

01:46:25.922 --> 01:46:30.568
who sent your only begotten son into the
world to crush that roaring lion...

01:46:31.094 --> 01:46:33.070
hasten to our call for help...

01:46:33.137 --> 01:46:38.117
and snatch from ruination and from
the clutches of the noonday devil...

01:46:38.184 --> 01:46:42.497
this human being, made in
your image and likeness.

01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:47.668
Strike terror, Lord, into the beast
now laying waste to your vineyard.

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:52.632
Let your mighty hand cast him out of
your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil...

01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:57.011
so he may no longer hold
captive this person...

01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:59.764
whom it pleased you to
make in your image...

01:46:59.831 --> 01:47:00.932
Aah!

01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:04.810
And to redeem through your son,
who lives and reigns with you...

01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:09.440
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:11.984
- Amen.
- O Lord, hear my prayer.

01:47:14.804 --> 01:47:16.489
Father Karras.

01:47:18.766 --> 01:47:20.618
Father Karras.

01:47:22.311 --> 01:47:25.957
Damien. The response,
please, Damien!

01:47:26.691 --> 01:47:29.126
And let my cry come unto thee.

01:47:29.193 --> 01:47:33.339
Almighty Lord, word of God
the Father, Jesus Christ...

01:47:33.406 --> 01:47:35.967
God and Lord of all creation...

01:47:37.243 --> 01:47:39.063
Who gave to your holy apostles...

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.306
the power to tramp underfoot
serpents and scorpions.

01:47:42.373 --> 01:47:44.392
Grant me...

01:47:44.459 --> 01:47:46.310
your unworthy servant...

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:48.354
- ...pardon for all my sins...
- Bastards!

01:47:48.421 --> 01:47:53.150
And the power to confront
this cruel demon.

01:48:09.734 --> 01:48:14.213
See the cross of the Lord.
Be gone, you hostile power.

01:48:14.322 --> 01:48:17.341
- O Lord, hear my prayer.
- And let my cry come unto thee.

01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:20.511
- The Lord be with you.
- And also with you.

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:52.376
Father.

01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:17.568
I cast you out, unclean spirit!

01:49:17.635 --> 01:49:20.863
- Shove it up your ass, you faggot!
- In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!

01:49:22.932 --> 01:49:25.201
It is he who commands you!

01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:28.829
He who flung you straight from
heaven to the depths of hell!

01:49:28.938 --> 01:49:30.289
- Fuck him!
- Be gone...

01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:33.417
- Fuck him, Karras!
- ...from this creature of God.

01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:37.463
Be gone!

01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:41.759
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

01:49:41.826 --> 01:49:43.761
and the Holy Spirit.

01:49:43.828 --> 01:49:48.391
By this sign of the Holy Cross,
of our Lord Jesus Christ...

01:49:48.457 --> 01:49:52.645
who lives and reigns with the
Father and the Holy Spirit.

01:49:54.255 --> 01:49:55.731
Damien!

01:49:56.299 --> 01:49:57.525
Amen.

01:49:57.633 --> 01:50:00.778
God, defender of the human race...

01:50:02.888 --> 01:50:04.281
look down in pity...

01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:07.451
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!

01:50:07.518 --> 01:50:09.745
- Shut up!
- She'll never forgive you!

01:50:09.812 --> 01:50:12.039
- Shut up!
- Bastard!

01:50:13.524 --> 01:50:15.167
I command you...

01:50:15.484 --> 01:50:18.379
by the judge of the
living and the dead...

01:50:18.446 --> 01:50:22.133
to depart from this servant of God.

01:50:24.702 --> 01:50:27.096
It's the power... Holy water.

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:35.396
It's the power of Christ
that compels you.

01:50:35.755 --> 01:50:38.941
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:42.319
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:50:42.386 --> 01:50:45.531
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:50:45.598 --> 01:50:48.826
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:50:48.893 --> 01:50:52.329
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:50:52.396 --> 01:50:56.041
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:50:56.108 --> 01:50:59.879
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:51:00.071 --> 01:51:04.175
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:08.095
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:51:08.412 --> 01:51:11.682
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:51:12.083 --> 01:51:15.770
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:19.356
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:51:19.423 --> 01:51:22.860
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

01:51:22.927 --> 01:51:26.405
- The power of Christ compels you.
- The power of Christ compels you.

01:51:26.472 --> 01:51:29.909
He brought you low by his
blood-stained cross!

01:51:29.975 --> 01:51:33.704
Do not despise my command, because
you know me to be a sinner.

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:41.212
It is God himself who commands you.

01:51:44.073 --> 01:51:47.676
The majestic Christ
who commands you.

01:51:48.869 --> 01:51:50.888
God, the Father, commands you.

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:56.644
God, the Son, commands you.

01:52:00.423 --> 01:52:03.275
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

01:52:03.342 --> 01:52:05.611
The mystery of the
cross commands you.

01:52:05.678 --> 01:52:08.614
The blood of the
martyrs commands you.

01:52:28.659 --> 01:52:32.763
Give way to Christ, you
prince of murderers.

01:52:33.956 --> 01:52:37.393
You're guilty before almighty God.

01:52:37.918 --> 01:52:40.521
Guilty before his son.

01:52:40.588 --> 01:52:43.774
Guilty before the whole human race.

01:52:44.008 --> 01:52:46.443
It is the Lord who expels you...

01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:52.199
he who is coming to judge both the living
and the dead and the world, by fire.

01:53:14.121 --> 01:53:15.806
Are you tired?

01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:26.025
Let's rest before we start again.

01:54:01.168 --> 01:54:05.022
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.

01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:16.659
I think the point is
to make us despair.

01:54:19.603 --> 01:54:21.872
To see ourselves as...

01:54:23.274 --> 01:54:25.626
animal and ugly.

01:54:28.863 --> 01:54:32.967
To reject the possibility
that God could love us.

01:54:40.416 --> 01:54:42.851
Will you excuse me, Damien?

01:55:34.678 --> 01:55:39.116
<i>Why? Why?</i>

01:55:40.684 --> 01:55:44.747
<i>No. No.</i>

01:56:10.381 --> 01:56:13.859
Dimmy, why you do this to me?

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:19.782
Please, Dimmy. I'm afraid.

01:56:21.225 --> 01:56:23.410
You're not my mother.

01:56:24.269 --> 01:56:26.580
Dimmy, please!

01:56:39.576 --> 01:56:41.345
What is it?

01:56:46.291 --> 01:56:47.476
Her heart.

01:56:47.918 --> 01:56:49.895
Can you give her something?

01:56:49.962 --> 01:56:51.897
She'll go into a coma.

01:56:55.759 --> 01:56:58.028
You're not my mother!

01:56:58.095 --> 01:56:59.196
Don't listen.

01:56:59.263 --> 01:57:00.989
Why, Dimmy?

01:57:01.849 --> 01:57:03.283
Damien.

01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:04.701
- Dimmy, please.
- Damien.

01:57:09.023 --> 01:57:10.874
Get out.

01:59:04.096 --> 01:59:08.408
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

01:59:23.866 --> 01:59:25.801
Is it over?

01:59:26.243 --> 01:59:27.928
Mm-mm.

01:59:35.752 --> 01:59:37.646
Is she gonna die?

01:59:42.885 --> 01:59:44.361
No.

02:01:02.172 --> 02:01:04.232
You son of a bitch!

02:01:10.097 --> 02:01:12.115
Take me.

02:01:12.182 --> 02:01:13.575
Come into me.

02:01:13.684 --> 02:01:16.787
Goddamn you, take me!

02:01:17.354 --> 02:01:19.081
Take me!

02:01:32.202 --> 02:01:33.762
No!

02:01:43.255 --> 02:01:44.398
Mother.

02:01:47.301 --> 02:01:49.152
Mother.

02:01:54.516 --> 02:01:57.452
Mother.

02:02:00.022 --> 02:02:01.331
Did somebody fall?

02:02:01.398 --> 02:02:02.958
- The steps!
- Help!

02:02:03.025 --> 02:02:04.835
Mother!

02:02:06.611 --> 02:02:07.754
Mother!

02:02:09.489 --> 02:02:10.632
Rags?

02:02:31.928 --> 02:02:34.448
Do you want to make
your confession?

02:02:40.228 --> 02:02:42.372
Are you sorry for...?

02:02:42.439 --> 02:02:47.169
Are you sorry for having offended God
and for all the sins of your past life?

02:03:16.264 --> 02:03:17.782
- Where do you want this?
- What?

02:03:17.849 --> 02:03:19.201
Phonograph.

02:03:19.267 --> 02:03:20.577
Storage.

02:03:29.986 --> 02:03:31.505
That's everything.

02:03:33.490 --> 02:03:35.300
I'm gonna miss you.

02:03:35.367 --> 02:03:36.843
Same here.

02:03:37.285 --> 02:03:39.054
Sure you won't change your mind?

02:03:54.803 --> 02:03:57.447
I found this in her room.

02:04:02.018 --> 02:04:03.954
You better hurry.

02:04:13.613 --> 02:04:15.549
Come on, honey,
we have to get going.

02:04:39.514 --> 02:04:41.408
She doesn't remember any of it.

02:04:41.892 --> 02:04:43.660
That's good.

02:04:47.397 --> 02:04:49.082
- All done.
- Okay.

02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:50.792
Honey, this is Father Dyer.

02:04:50.859 --> 02:04:53.169
- Hi, Father.
- Hello.

02:04:53.945 --> 02:04:55.130
Ready, missus.

02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:58.508
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

02:04:58.575 --> 02:05:00.093
I'll call you.

02:05:20.805 --> 02:05:22.490
Bye.

02:05:26.728 --> 02:05:28.580
- Bye, Father.
- I hope I see you again.

02:05:28.647 --> 02:05:30.248
I hope so too.

02:05:30.732 --> 02:05:32.709
Father Dyer?

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.883
I thought you'd like to keep this.

02:05:48.917 --> 02:05:50.602
Why don't you keep it?

02:06:55.066 --> 02:06:56.418
Lieutenant.

02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:58.962
You just missed them.

02:07:02.157 --> 02:07:03.758
How's the girl?

02:07:04.576 --> 02:07:06.302
She seemed fine.

02:07:06.911 --> 02:07:08.722
That's important.

02:07:10.707 --> 02:07:12.350
That's important.

02:07:13.376 --> 02:07:15.603
Well, well...

02:07:15.670 --> 02:07:18.148
back to business, back to work.

02:07:18.757 --> 02:07:21.526
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

02:07:26.139 --> 02:07:27.490
Father Dyer...

02:07:29.559 --> 02:07:31.453
do you go to films?

02:07:31.519 --> 02:07:32.662
Sure.

02:07:32.854 --> 02:07:36.040
Well, I got passes.

02:07:36.107 --> 02:07:38.543
In fact, I got a pass to
the Crest tomorrow night.

02:07:38.610 --> 02:07:39.836
Would you like to go?

02:07:39.903 --> 02:07:42.756
- What's playing?
<i>- Wuthering Heights.</i>

02:07:42.822 --> 02:07:44.424
Who's in it?

02:07:45.116 --> 02:07:51.306
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the
role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.

02:07:52.707 --> 02:07:54.350
I've seen it.

02:07:58.630 --> 02:08:00.190
Another one.

02:08:00.924 --> 02:08:03.526
- Had your lunch?
- No.
