I'm really gonna
let him have it.

00:12.995 --> 00:13.979
Hurry up, Norm.

Sammy's getting
a lot faster at this.

00:15.681 --> 00:17.181
Got it.

Hey, Norm.

Mail-gram for you, Fras.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.577
CLIFF:
Well, I'll be darned.

01:18.644 --> 01:20.045
Yeah, what's that?

01:20.112 --> 01:21.780
Well, it says here if you walk

01:21.847 --> 01:24.449
with a quarter wedged
between your knees

01:24.516 --> 01:28.053
your, your posture
will be a lot better.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.255
Hey, give me a couple of bits
here, Norm, I want to try it.

01:32.991 --> 01:35.293
Tell you what, Cliff...

01:35.361 --> 01:37.462
here's a buck
to not try it, okay?

01:37.529 --> 01:41.132
Fair enough.

01:41.199 --> 01:43.401
(groans)

01:43.469 --> 01:45.036
What's the matter?

01:46.806 --> 01:48.706
It's from Lilith.

01:50.376 --> 01:53.944
Oh, that's awful.

01:54.012 --> 01:55.730
What? What's awful?

01:55.797 --> 02:01.552
"Dear Frasier, life in
the Eco-pod is wonderful.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.404
"Googie and I are happier

02:03.472 --> 02:05.991
"than we've ever been.

02:06.058 --> 02:08.059
"Please start divorce
proceedings.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.129
Our marriage is..."

02:11.197 --> 02:14.282
Made in heaven?

02:16.101 --> 02:18.770
"Our marriage
is over."

02:18.838 --> 02:22.473
That burns my hide- Lilith
sending that Mail-gram.

02:22.541 --> 02:24.225
Well, thank you, Cliff.

02:24.293 --> 02:27.545
Well, all of a sudden
a first class stamp isn't any good anymore?

02:27.613 --> 02:29.798
I mean, people,

02:29.799 --> 02:32.166
I've been telling you,
I mean, our success rate

02:32.167 --> 02:33.301
is almost 50%!

02:33.309 --> 02:36.538
Well, you know,
unless it's raining,

02:36.539 --> 02:38.573
'cause then the tires...

02:38.641 --> 02:40.591
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.960
Sorry.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.428
Oh, thank you, Sam.

02:44.496 --> 02:47.365
Divorce, Lilith
wants a divorce.

02:47.432 --> 02:50.368
You know, I, I know
we've been separated

02:50.369 --> 02:52.603
and I've been saying
some pretty bitter things,

02:52.604 --> 02:55.573
but... I guess deep down
in my heart of hearts,

02:55.641 --> 02:58.543
I'd always hoped for some
sort of a reconciliation.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.130
Now I just don't
know how to feel.

03:02.197 --> 03:03.497
Hey, you know, Fras,

03:03.498 --> 03:05.633
I went through this same
thing when Nick left me.

03:05.634 --> 03:09.037
And the way I look at it,
here's what you can do.

03:09.104 --> 03:12.706
You can get angry and bitter,
learn to hate the world,

03:12.774 --> 03:14.475
snap at people.

03:14.543 --> 03:15.643
Or?

03:15.710 --> 03:17.711
Or what?

03:21.716 --> 03:25.487
You want to talk about it, make
yourself feel a little better?

03:25.554 --> 03:27.964
Oh, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Sam,

03:27.990 --> 03:31.092
but, uh, I think I'd just, uh,

03:31.160 --> 03:32.960
rather be alone right now.

03:35.448 --> 03:39.050
Try to figure out how
I'm gonna carry on now that,

03:39.118 --> 03:43.021
I know that Lilith
is never coming back.

03:48.744 --> 03:49.794
Boy, oh boy.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.529
That must be rough, huh?

03:51.597 --> 03:53.031
I've never been married,

03:53.099 --> 03:57.368
but, uh, I remember
how depressed I was when Ma left me.

03:57.369 --> 04:01.589
You referring to the time your
mother moved to Florida

04:01.590 --> 04:03.491
when you were 37 years old?

04:03.559 --> 04:05.643
It still hurt.

04:08.564 --> 04:10.080
Poor Fras.

04:10.148 --> 04:11.916
Boy, I'm never seen him so sad.

04:11.983 --> 04:13.183
And it's too bad.

04:13.184 --> 04:14.569
You know, he's always
there for us.

04:14.570 --> 04:15.636
He's always helping us out.

04:15.637 --> 04:17.471
What can we do to cheer him up?

04:17.539 --> 04:18.589
I don't know.

04:18.624 --> 04:19.957
Oh, I've got it.

04:20.024 --> 04:21.659
Oh! We'll throw
him a party.

04:21.726 --> 04:22.777
What?

04:22.828 --> 04:24.962
A divorce party.

04:24.963 --> 04:27.064
You know, then that way he'll
know that all his friends

04:27.065 --> 04:29.317
support him and, and maybe it'll
brighten his day a little bit.

04:29.318 --> 04:31.836
We'll, we'll have it
for him tomorrow when he usually comes in.

04:31.837 --> 04:33.772
I don't know, you know,
a party for a guy

04:33.773 --> 04:35.273
whose wife just left him...

04:35.341 --> 04:37.175
uh... it seems
kind of strange.

04:37.242 --> 04:39.611
Makes perfect sense to me.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.251
Look out, everybody,
here he comes.

04:47.252 --> 04:48.953
Okay, what do we yell
when he comes in?

04:48.954 --> 04:50.538
Just yell, "Surprise!"

04:50.606 --> 04:54.959
Surprise, surprise, surprise...

04:55.027 --> 04:56.227
okay, I think I've got it.

04:56.295 --> 04:59.413
ALL:
Surprise!

04:59.481 --> 05:02.099
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

05:02.167 --> 05:03.968
♪ For he's
a jolly good fellow ♪

05:04.036 --> 05:07.255
♪ For he's a jolly good
fellow... ♪

05:07.322 --> 05:09.674
♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

05:09.741 --> 05:12.677
(cheering)

05:12.744 --> 05:14.512
Is this for me?

05:14.513 --> 05:16.280
Yes, I thought it would help
you get over Lilith.

05:16.281 --> 05:18.349
Do you like it?
Oh, very much. Thank you.

05:18.416 --> 05:19.584
Well, it was my idea.

05:19.651 --> 05:21.686
The guys fought me
at every turn.

05:21.753 --> 05:24.189
Okay, everybody,
let's lift our glasses here

05:24.190 --> 05:25.890
and toast Frasier's
new-found freedom!

05:25.891 --> 05:27.024
Yeah!
Yeah!

05:27.092 --> 05:29.460
Woody, you having a beer?

05:29.528 --> 05:31.529
Why not?

05:31.597 --> 05:33.397
I'm a grown man, I'm an adult.

05:33.465 --> 05:36.133
I can handle my alcohol.

05:36.201 --> 05:37.891
Plus we're out
of chocolate milk.

05:37.903 --> 05:40.254
(glass clinking)

05:40.322 --> 05:43.141
I want to make the
first toast to Frasier.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.043
Lilith stinks!

05:45.110 --> 05:47.611
ALL:
Lilith stinks!

05:47.680 --> 05:50.014
Profoundly put.

05:50.015 --> 05:52.032
But I really don't want
this to degenerate

05:52.033 --> 05:56.437
into a "bash Lilith" party, so,
look, what's done is done.

05:56.505 --> 05:58.339
It's about time I got over it.

05:58.340 --> 05:59.908
Oh, well, then you're
not going to like

05:59.909 --> 06:01.242
what we did to the dart board.

06:01.243 --> 06:03.577
Dah!

06:03.645 --> 06:06.948
Well, maybe just one throw.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.321
(cheering)

06:14.389 --> 06:16.157
Nice shot!
All right, Frasier!

06:16.224 --> 06:17.959
Well, I've got one at home.

06:24.049 --> 06:26.551
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

06:26.618 --> 06:28.368
Woody, uh, exactly
how many beers

06:28.387 --> 06:30.137
have you had there,
young fellow?

06:31.674 --> 06:34.542
Just one... Mom.

06:35.911 --> 06:37.979
Wood, you got to be
careful there, buddy.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.482
You never know how liquor's
going to affect you, you know?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.183
Sometimes you
can get depressed.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.985
Sometimes you get giddy.

06:44.052 --> 06:47.254
So, Norm, when're you gonna get
off your butt and get a job?

06:47.322 --> 06:50.291
Sometimes you just
get brutally honest.

06:50.359 --> 06:53.077
Frasier, you know
how I feel about you.

06:53.078 --> 06:54.511
But I'm not
any good with words,

06:54.512 --> 06:57.181
so I'm gonna let this
do the talking for me.

06:57.248 --> 06:58.749
(tawdry trumpet riff)

07:03.155 --> 07:05.022
(strip tease music playing)

07:05.090 --> 07:07.024
(patrons hooting and hollering)

07:08.861 --> 07:11.595
Oh, Lordy, look at that!

07:11.663 --> 07:14.315
Yeah!
Cake!

07:17.035 --> 07:19.737
All right, huh? The world
of the exotic dancer.

07:19.805 --> 07:21.739
A little sleazy if you ask me.

07:21.807 --> 07:25.143
Almost as sleazy as the types
who frequent those joints.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.878
Oh, hey! It's Cliff!

07:31.417 --> 07:34.652
Hey, uh, I must
look like a Cliff.

07:35.934 --> 07:40.024
Uh, excuse me, miss,
could you move the veil,

07:40.025 --> 07:42.493
you're blocking
the mocha creme, here.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.861
You're kidding, right?

07:43.929 --> 07:46.046
No, you see, uh, sweetheart,

07:46.047 --> 07:47.715
over the years
our priorities change.

07:47.716 --> 07:49.550
Yeah? How so?

07:51.436 --> 07:54.856
Hey there, Miss Krapence.

07:54.923 --> 07:56.657
That's Mr. Krapence.

07:56.725 --> 07:59.143
That's not what I heard.

08:00.812 --> 08:02.647
Say, Woody, why
don't you sit down

08:02.648 --> 08:04.381
right here for a
while, all right?

08:04.382 --> 08:07.051
What's with this
"Miss Krapence" stuff?

08:07.119 --> 08:08.869
I mean, who's been
making cracks?

08:08.921 --> 08:12.023
I've got an ex-wife,
you know.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.392
Whoa, what-what-what
are you doin' man?

08:14.460 --> 08:17.050
Why, why, why are you taking
shots at, at Paul, huh?

08:17.096 --> 08:18.229
Well, come on, Sam,

08:18.297 --> 08:19.947
use your head.

08:20.015 --> 08:22.049
The guy's in his 40s,
he's not married.

08:22.050 --> 08:23.885
He's always braggin'
about his sex life

08:23.886 --> 08:25.086
and yet he's always here.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.255
It all adds up, Sam.

08:27.322 --> 08:30.792
Or should I say, Samantha?

08:43.554 --> 08:45.485
Would you guys do
something with him?

08:47.492 --> 08:49.894
Look at that, Norm.
He's fast asleep.

08:49.961 --> 08:51.729
Hmm?

08:51.797 --> 08:53.463
Oop!

08:53.531 --> 08:56.500
Oop! Look at this legs-
they're twitching.

08:56.568 --> 08:59.987
I bet you he's dreaming
he's chasing rabbits.

09:00.055 --> 09:02.040
Don't be ridiculous, Cliff.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.275
Only dogs dream about
chasing rabbits.

09:04.343 --> 09:06.126
(barking)

09:08.530 --> 09:10.520
Frasier, are you
enjoying your party?

09:10.521 --> 09:11.615
Yes, I am, very much.

09:11.616 --> 09:14.518
Uh, friends,

09:14.586 --> 09:16.487
uh, I just wanted
to say thanks.

09:16.488 --> 09:17.821
Really, thank you very much.

09:17.822 --> 09:19.757
Aw.
Okay.

09:19.824 --> 09:22.593
It's just terrific you
guys tried to cheer me up

09:22.660 --> 09:26.197
and, uh, I just think it's time
I was shoving off now, okay?

09:26.265 --> 09:28.182
Frasier, you're going home?

09:28.250 --> 09:30.768
Well, yes, and, uh,
thank you again, Rebecca,

09:30.836 --> 09:34.004
for putting all this together.

09:34.072 --> 09:36.690
Frasier, are you going
to be all right?

09:36.758 --> 09:40.427
I, I just get a little emotional
when I, when I drink too much.

09:40.495 --> 09:43.330
(laughing):
Look at me.

09:43.331 --> 09:44.281
Fras, you know what?

09:44.282 --> 09:45.616
I think I'm gonna
drive you home.

09:45.617 --> 09:47.918
Oh, I would really
appreciate that, Rebecca.

09:47.986 --> 09:50.555
I sent Frederick
to his grandmother's,

09:50.622 --> 09:53.291
and I just don't want to go
home to that house alone.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.759
Frasier for what it's worth,

09:54.760 --> 09:57.328
I think that Lilith
made a big mistake. Well, thank you.

09:57.329 --> 09:58.528
And for what it's worth,

09:58.529 --> 10:00.564
I think that Evan Drake
made a big mistake, too.

10:00.565 --> 10:01.766
Thank you, Frasier.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.334
And, well, uh,
while we're at it,

10:03.335 --> 10:05.670
so did Sam, and, uh,
Martin Teal,

10:05.737 --> 10:07.538
and Robin Colcord and that...

10:07.606 --> 10:11.041
that cousin of Woody's
that used to play the piano,

10:11.109 --> 10:13.344
and Mark Newberger.

10:13.345 --> 10:15.279
And those are just
the ones you know about.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.781
Ah.

10:22.020 --> 10:26.440
I hope you didn't mind my
pouring my guts out to you.

10:26.508 --> 10:28.542
I didn't mind a bit.
I was glad to help.

10:28.543 --> 10:30.061
So I'll see you
tomorrow at work?

10:30.062 --> 10:32.714
Uh, Rebecca, why don't
you come on in for a bit?

10:32.781 --> 10:34.615
I'll make some coffee.

10:34.683 --> 10:36.417
Sure. Okay.
Great.

10:36.484 --> 10:37.624
All I've got's instant.

10:37.669 --> 10:39.102
Oh, instant's fine.

10:39.103 --> 10:40.904
You know, come
to think of it, Fras,

10:40.905 --> 10:42.440
you have a really hard job.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.343
You listen to other people tell
you their problems all day long

10:45.344 --> 10:48.178
and you never really have a
chance to talk about yourself.

10:48.179 --> 10:49.747
You're a very sympathetic
person, Rebecca.

10:49.748 --> 10:50.948
Thanks again.

10:51.016 --> 10:53.283
Frasier, would you
quit thanking me?

10:53.284 --> 10:55.352
That's what friends do,
they help each other.

10:55.353 --> 10:57.070
You really are
my friend, aren't you?

10:57.071 --> 10:59.039
Well, of course I am.

11:11.519 --> 11:13.821
Fras, I think I better go.

11:13.889 --> 11:15.656
Oh, oh, God.

11:15.724 --> 11:18.158
Rebecca,
I'm-I'm so sorry.

11:18.226 --> 11:23.831
Uh, this... this is
entirely unintentional.

11:23.899 --> 11:26.033
I-It wasn't premeditated
or anything.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.735
I, uh, oh, God, uh...

11:27.736 --> 11:29.603
Frasier, I understand what
you're trying to say.

11:29.604 --> 11:31.204
Let's just forget
it ever happened, okay?

11:31.205 --> 11:32.406
Rebecca, wait, wait.

11:32.407 --> 11:34.374
I've always found you,
you know, rather attractive.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.875
Well, very attractive really.

11:35.876 --> 11:37.779
Well, thank you very much.
That's sweet of you to say,

11:37.780 --> 11:39.313
but I really think
I'd better be go...

11:39.314 --> 11:41.799
It's just that seeing you
now in my home,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.534
looking into
your beautiful eyes,

11:43.535 --> 11:46.153
I just wanted to,

11:46.221 --> 11:48.005
I had to...

11:51.543 --> 11:53.494
Oh, God, what am I doing?!

11:53.562 --> 11:58.799
This is not romantic,
this is just weird!

11:58.866 --> 12:01.335
Frasier, y-you're my friend!

12:01.403 --> 12:03.137
I've known you for years!

12:03.138 --> 12:05.106
First Sam, now you.
Who's next- Cliff?

12:05.107 --> 12:07.007
Oh, God!

12:07.075 --> 12:10.110
Oh, Rebecca, you, you have
to admit,

12:10.178 --> 12:13.346
there's always been some
sexual tension between us.

12:13.414 --> 12:15.099
There has?

12:15.167 --> 12:17.935
Yes. It started the first day
you came into the bar.

12:18.003 --> 12:20.838
I heard your sexy, smoky voice.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.573
I, I looked up and I thought,

12:22.641 --> 12:24.091
"My God!
Who is that woman?"

12:24.092 --> 12:25.108
Really?!

12:25.109 --> 12:28.245
Really.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.047
Your turn.

12:30.114 --> 12:31.882
What did you think
when you saw me?

12:31.950 --> 12:36.220
I thought...

12:38.323 --> 12:41.726
Well, you know, Fras, I met
so many people that day.

12:41.793 --> 12:45.312
Well, I mean, through the years

12:45.380 --> 12:48.182
you must have at least found me
a, a little attractive.

12:48.250 --> 12:52.569
Well, I, uh...

12:52.637 --> 12:54.071
Oh, come on!

12:54.072 --> 12:57.758
I mean, surely
for as long as we've known each other,

12:57.759 --> 12:59.026
there has to be some
sexual tension!

12:59.027 --> 13:00.261
Why?!

13:00.262 --> 13:02.362
Well it's been proven
in scientific journals!

13:02.363 --> 13:04.598
People who spend any amount
of time with each other

13:04.599 --> 13:07.101
do experience some sort of
subconscious sexual attraction!

13:07.102 --> 13:08.235
Are you sure?

13:08.303 --> 13:10.054
Do you want me
to get the book?!

13:10.055 --> 13:11.255
No, no, no, Frasier,
Frasier, Frasier,

13:11.256 --> 13:12.422
Frasier, forget the book!

13:12.423 --> 13:15.592
Frasier,
listen to me. I...

13:15.660 --> 13:18.745
You are a very attractive man.

13:18.813 --> 13:22.483
And you're funny, you're witty,
and you're very charming.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.385
And one time,

13:24.452 --> 13:27.338
you came in the bar
and you had on these pants,

13:27.406 --> 13:30.774
and they made your buns
look really cute.

13:30.842 --> 13:31.992
What colour were they?

13:32.060 --> 13:33.594
I could go put them on.

13:33.662 --> 13:36.413
No, Fras...

13:36.481 --> 13:38.883
Fras, you don't need to put
those pants on.

13:38.951 --> 13:42.687
My, my point here is that, for
all the years I've known you,

13:42.754 --> 13:44.755
you have been married.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.424
So, uh, I just, I never
really took notice.

13:47.492 --> 13:49.944
Well, I'm not married now.

13:50.012 --> 13:52.713
No, you're not.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.154
Yeah, he's still out cold,
Normie.

14:01.155 --> 14:02.640
Mm.
Think we ought to wake him?

14:02.641 --> 14:04.474
Well, we could.

14:04.475 --> 14:06.243
You know, we could take him
over to his house

14:06.244 --> 14:08.414
and, uh, get him undressed,
put him in bed,

14:08.479 --> 14:10.447
let him sleep it off
in peace and quiet.

14:10.515 --> 14:12.683
Yeah, we could do that.

14:15.587 --> 14:19.457
But we're not going to, are we?

14:19.524 --> 14:22.192
No, sir, my good friend,
we are not.

14:22.193 --> 14:23.878
What we are going
to do, though,

14:23.879 --> 14:26.413
is, uh, get a pan
of warm water,

14:26.481 --> 14:27.715
put his hand in it,

14:27.783 --> 14:31.351
and, uh, step back
and watch the hilarity ensue.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.948
Guys, am I the only one here
who's concerned about Frasier?

14:37.842 --> 14:39.643
I think so.

14:39.711 --> 14:40.911
You know, this could be

14:40.979 --> 14:43.848
a depressing night for him,
you know?

14:43.849 --> 14:45.382
We're his friends,
and here we are

14:45.383 --> 14:47.250
just playing stupid camp games
with Woody.

14:47.251 --> 14:48.585
Wait a minute.

14:48.653 --> 14:53.057
The hand in the pan of warm
water a stupid camp game?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.926
I don't even know who you are,
Sam Malone.

14:55.994 --> 14:58.028
I'm serious.

14:58.029 --> 14:59.763
Remember the last time
he got this upset?

14:59.764 --> 15:01.565
He ended up on a ledge.

15:01.633 --> 15:03.667
Yeah, you're right about that.

15:03.668 --> 15:05.052
All I'm saying is maybe he
shouldn't be alone.

15:05.053 --> 15:06.420
Yeah, yeah, maybe

15:06.421 --> 15:08.772
we ought to go over there with
some chips and a pizza.

15:08.773 --> 15:10.207
Thank you.

15:10.274 --> 15:13.410
Yeah. I'll get some videos
or something, right?

15:13.411 --> 15:15.746
Well, yeah, it feels good
to do something nice

15:15.747 --> 15:17.147
for somebody sometimes, yeah?

15:17.148 --> 15:18.482
Yeah.
This is Cheers, right?

15:18.483 --> 15:19.863
We, we stick with each other.

15:19.864 --> 15:21.952
NORM:
That's right. We take care of our own.

15:21.953 --> 15:23.587
Hey, guys,
you'd better take an umbrella.

15:23.588 --> 15:24.668
It's starting to mist.

15:24.722 --> 15:27.975
Mist?

15:28.043 --> 15:29.409
Oh, man, that, uh,

15:29.477 --> 15:33.130
that really messes up my hair.

15:33.131 --> 15:34.465
It's not gonna help the tickle

15:34.466 --> 15:35.999
in the back
of my throat either.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.685
And this, uh, sweater
is sure to pill.

15:38.753 --> 15:41.455
Well, now what are we gonna do?

15:43.841 --> 15:45.993
I'll get the pan.
You heat up the water.

15:58.807 --> 16:02.043
Now, Rebecca, you're,
you're sure you're okay with this?

16:02.044 --> 16:03.811
Because I wouldn't want
to do anything

16:03.812 --> 16:05.813
to compromise our friendship,

16:05.881 --> 16:08.549
and I know you're in a very
delicate state right now.

16:08.616 --> 16:10.051
You ready to hit the sack?

16:10.118 --> 16:11.802
Right upstairs.

16:14.422 --> 16:16.123
You get some champagne

16:16.124 --> 16:17.791
and I'll go upstairs
and get ready.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.159
Right. Okay.

16:19.227 --> 16:21.195
Take your time.

16:21.262 --> 16:23.030
This is not a drill.

16:27.836 --> 16:29.486
This is not a drill!

16:32.506 --> 16:34.407
(humming)

16:37.728 --> 16:39.046
(doorbell rings)

16:39.113 --> 16:40.497
Damn!

16:45.336 --> 16:46.686
Hey!
There you are!

16:46.754 --> 16:48.144
(laughs) I didn't want you

16:48.156 --> 16:50.891
to be alone and depressed
on a night like this.

16:50.959 --> 16:53.260
So what I did was
I brought over

16:53.261 --> 16:54.962
some Three Stooges
tapes we can watch.

16:54.963 --> 16:57.564
Whoo! Gloomy in here.
There you go!

16:57.631 --> 16:59.132
Listen, Sam, uh...

16:59.200 --> 17:00.734
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

17:00.801 --> 17:03.988
My hair's all frizzy.
But what the heck?

17:03.989 --> 17:04.988
You're worth it, buddy.

17:04.989 --> 17:06.290
Sam...

17:06.290 --> 17:08.391
You know, I was thinking
about not coming here.

17:08.392 --> 17:10.644
Then I thought about how,
you know,

17:10.645 --> 17:12.880
how you'd feel to see
a friendly face around,

17:12.881 --> 17:13.881
so here I am.

17:13.882 --> 17:14.882
(both chuckle)

17:14.883 --> 17:17.117
Sam, uh...
Yeah?

17:17.184 --> 17:21.121
I, I appreciate all
this, but, you know,

17:21.188 --> 17:23.490
that you're here in
my hour of need and all,

17:23.558 --> 17:24.958
and I just want to tell you

17:25.026 --> 17:26.492
I think I'm okay with it now.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.995
I think I'm just
gonna head upstairs

17:29.063 --> 17:30.564
and you know... (yawns)

17:30.632 --> 17:32.132
put my head down, you know?

17:32.199 --> 17:33.667
I, I...

17:33.668 --> 17:34.735
Hi, Fras.

17:34.736 --> 17:36.002
Carla!
Hey!

17:36.070 --> 17:38.600
Oh, Fras, sorry about your wife,
blah, blah, blah.

17:38.606 --> 17:40.808
Well, brought some pizza.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.560
I'm just gonna dig right in.

17:43.561 --> 17:45.228
Give me a piece, there,
will you?

17:45.229 --> 17:48.916
Uh, Sam, this is such
a wonderful gesture.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.584
It shows a sensitivity that I...

17:50.652 --> 17:52.486
(Sam and Carla laugh)

17:52.553 --> 17:56.857
Geez, doesn't that
hurt Curly's nose?

17:56.925 --> 17:58.525
Well, of course it does.

17:58.593 --> 18:00.694
That's what makes it funny.

18:00.762 --> 18:01.962
(laughs)

18:03.798 --> 18:05.766
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

18:05.767 --> 18:06.834
Woo-oo-oo-oo!
Woo-oo-oo-oo!

18:06.835 --> 18:08.769
You got anything
to wash this down with?

18:08.770 --> 18:10.070
Yeah. How about
some napkins?

18:10.071 --> 18:12.006
Um, sure.
I'll, I'll get some.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.140
They're, they're upstairs.

18:13.141 --> 18:14.675
That's where we keep them.

18:14.742 --> 18:19.546
I'll be, I'll be back in, oh,
15 minutes or so.

18:19.614 --> 18:21.515
(doorbell rings)

18:21.582 --> 18:23.834
Are you guys expecting anyone?

18:23.902 --> 18:25.652
Uh, yeah, Norm and Cliff.

18:30.091 --> 18:32.459
Aha! Tell him what
he's won, Bob!

18:32.527 --> 18:35.128
Whoa! Pizza!

18:35.129 --> 18:36.196
Beer.

18:36.197 --> 18:38.098
Norm, Norm brought beer! Well.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.867
No, no, no, I need a beer.
I'm a little thirsty.

18:40.935 --> 18:42.505
Sure.
I'll, uh, I'll get you one.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.054
It's, uh, it's upstairs.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.622
You keep your beer upstairs?

18:45.623 --> 18:46.857
Uh, yeah, in the bedroom.

18:46.858 --> 18:47.941
You, too?

18:50.245 --> 18:51.962
(doorbell rings)

18:54.365 --> 18:56.333
Paul! (chuckles)

18:56.401 --> 18:59.970
Are you, uh, alone or did you
bring some friends, Paul?

19:00.038 --> 19:05.309
What's that supposed to mean?

19:05.376 --> 19:07.677
Well...

19:07.745 --> 19:10.080
Nothing.

19:10.081 --> 19:11.148
Come on in.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.349
Thanks for cheering me up.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.017
I didn't come here
to cheer you up.

19:14.018 --> 19:15.752
I, I came to say something.

19:15.820 --> 19:19.139
Everybody, there's, there's
something I've got to say.

19:19.140 --> 19:20.741
Uh, Woody made some comments
earlier,

19:20.742 --> 19:23.577
and at first I was angry,
but then I got to thinking.

19:23.645 --> 19:25.275
I took a long hard
look at myself.

19:25.297 --> 19:28.782
I'm 45 years old, my mother's
dead, what am I waiting for?

19:28.850 --> 19:31.951
I, I guess what I'm trying
to say is "World..."

19:32.019 --> 19:34.454
Hey, Paul,

19:34.522 --> 19:36.623
this is Frasier's night.
Do you mind?

19:40.728 --> 19:43.863
You're right, Sammy.
I'm sorry.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.453
Is there any pizza left?

19:50.521 --> 19:52.139
I don't think so, Paul.

19:54.509 --> 19:57.978
Just, uh, make yourself
at home, Paul.

19:58.045 --> 20:00.514
Say, my God, is it
still raining outside?

20:00.582 --> 20:02.583
You know, I'm, I'm gonna
go upstairs

20:02.584 --> 20:03.817
and close those windows.

20:03.818 --> 20:05.386
Okay? I'll probably be
a little while.

20:05.387 --> 20:07.120
Oh, no, no!
Hold on!

20:07.188 --> 20:08.822
Whoa, no, you don't, buddy.

20:08.823 --> 20:11.357
You're not gonna go up there and
brood and be all alone by yourself.

20:11.358 --> 20:12.759
No way. No way.

20:12.827 --> 20:15.295
We're here to make sure
that you enjoy yourself.

20:15.362 --> 20:18.832
Well, then let me
go upstairs and close the windows!

20:18.900 --> 20:20.267
I beg of you!

20:20.268 --> 20:22.402
It's been a long time
since I've closed the windows!

20:22.403 --> 20:23.937
They're wide open!

20:24.124 --> 20:26.957
Don't you be silly, you big lug.

20:26.958 --> 20:28.292
Hey, look what we did here.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.660
We made a little space
for you on the sofa.

20:30.728 --> 20:32.579
Yeah, you can be the meat

20:32.647 --> 20:34.982
in our best friend sandwich.

20:35.049 --> 20:40.904
Hey, Fras, we got six hours
of The Stooges for you, man.

20:40.972 --> 20:43.657
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

20:43.658 --> 20:45.075
Oh, God, look at that, fellows.

20:45.076 --> 20:47.777
You big lug,
you got a tear in your eye.

20:54.235 --> 20:55.401
FRASIER:
Okay, guys...

20:55.402 --> 20:56.603
SAM:
Take care, buddy.

20:56.604 --> 20:58.404
Thanks again.
Good night.

20:58.405 --> 20:59.472
CLIFF:
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

20:59.473 --> 21:00.907
Yes, yes,
nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.

21:00.908 --> 21:02.575
SAM:
We'll watch these again some other time.

21:02.576 --> 21:04.026
Okay, bye-bye.
(door shuts)

21:04.078 --> 21:05.578
(quick footsteps on stairs)

21:20.928 --> 21:22.529
Oh, Frasier, I'm sorry.

21:22.596 --> 21:24.230
I must have fallen asleep.

21:24.298 --> 21:25.348
What time is it?

21:25.366 --> 21:27.167
Well, it's pretty late.

21:27.234 --> 21:31.371
Uh, I guess I'll go
downstairs and, uh, sleep on the couch.

21:31.438 --> 21:32.518
Maybe I should just go.

21:32.573 --> 21:35.909
No, no, you don't
have to go home.

21:35.977 --> 21:38.311
You don't have
to sleep on the couch.

21:40.915 --> 21:42.348
Just a second.

21:48.589 --> 21:51.125
(door opens, shuts)

21:51.192 --> 21:52.392
Frasier, what was that?

21:52.393 --> 21:53.494
What was what?

21:53.495 --> 21:56.130
I thought I heard a door slam.

21:56.131 --> 21:58.399
You don't think those guys
are back, do you?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.466
No, no impossible.

21:59.467 --> 22:00.734
I locked and dead bolted it.

22:00.735 --> 22:03.303
They'd need a key to get in.

22:03.371 --> 22:05.672
Now where were we?

22:09.828 --> 22:11.998
Let's make this a night
we'll never forget.

22:16.067 --> 22:17.534
(door opens)

22:23.224 --> 22:24.775
Frasier?

22:24.843 --> 22:27.060
Lilith!

22:29.997 --> 22:31.798
Rebecca?!

22:31.866 --> 22:34.451
Lilith.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.241
Am I the only one
who feels awkward here?

22:42.305 --> 22:48.838
