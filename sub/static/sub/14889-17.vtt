about the person

01:32.693 --> 01:34.861
sitting on your right?"

01:37.330 --> 01:39.566
Ooh. This should be good.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.170
This is very hard
for me to say.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.507
The‐the‐the thing
that bothers me most

01:46.540 --> 01:48.141
about cousin Larry

01:48.174 --> 01:51.878
is...he doesn’t give
himself enough credit

01:51.912 --> 01:54.480
for all the good
things he does.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.824

if I’ve hurt you.

Mary Anne, your turn.

just like you.

almost perfect.

worth mentioning

to win the game.

I don’t do that.

Yes, you do.
Who’s next?

03:03.817 --> 03:04.918
Wait a minute, Mary Anne,
if‐if your gonna

03:04.951 --> 03:07.387
make a statement like that,
you have to explain it.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.622
Should I roll
the dice for you?

03:08.655 --> 03:10.223
Not now, Larry.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.628
Now, what do you mean
I correct everything you do?

03:14.661 --> 03:16.496
Alright,
fine, for example

03:16.530 --> 03:18.364
every time I check
the passengers’ seat belts

03:18.398 --> 03:21.234
you follow right along

03:21.267 --> 03:23.504

You’re careless.

‐I am not.
‐’Oh yeah?’

03:25.471 --> 03:27.240
Last week
you left the oven on.

03:27.273 --> 03:30.677
‐I was baking cookies.
‐For three days?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.948
Well, I’m surprised
you had time to check the oven

03:34.981 --> 03:37.584
you spend so much time
in front of a mirror.

03:39.853 --> 03:43.824

my makeup on with a spray gun.

This from a person
who snores like a teamster!

03:52.065 --> 03:53.900
I don’t have to sit here
and take this from someone

03:53.934 --> 03:56.603
who can’t remember
her real hair color.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.805

Oh! Oh, yeah?

04:30.537 --> 04:31.738

04:31.772 --> 04:33.674
before I move out.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.842
Why you are moving out?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.443
Because I would
rather eat glass

04:37.477 --> 04:39.846
than live with Jennifer!

04:39.880 --> 04:42.482
Mary Anne,
you can’t be serious.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.417
Cousin Larry’s right.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.688
Glass is really tough
on your digestive system.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.059

is your best friend.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.360

stay in a hotel

until I find
my own place.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.600
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.635
You can forget about
going to a hotel.

05:01.668 --> 05:02.836
You’ll stay
right here with us.

05:02.869 --> 05:05.338
You’ll sleep in my room,
and I’ll stay on the couch.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.439
Oh, Balki,
I couldn’t do that.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.509
I’d be putting you out.
I’ll stay in a hotel.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.876

think that’s best.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.111
No, no, no.

in there and start unpacking.

are the greatest.

out of your way.

a huge mistake.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.035
I’m sorry, cousin.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.037
Did you want to
give her your room?

05:38.639 --> 05:39.973
I’ll go ask her.

05:41.808 --> 05:45.145
I mean, you put us right in
the middle of their argument.

helping Mary Anne.

if Jennifer wanted to stay here?

But that’s not the point.

is going to think that

05:58.925 --> 06:00.393
I’m taking
Mary Anne’s side.

Now, wait a minute.

is my girlfriend.

staying in my room.

wearing my robe.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.705
She’ll be using
my Mr. Ducky bubble bath.

Jennifer could get mad at you.

of our bathroom in a week.

at the gas station is available.

for some coffee?

10:25.358 --> 10:27.060
I’ll have
pancakes too.

ever get back together?

they’re still not talking.

is gonna go on.

my girlfriend to move out.

she combs her hair.

she sips her tea.

she’s changed my life.

away from me.

stay here anymore.

stay here anymore.

you can do or say

will change my mind!

I have to say to you.

Well, before you do
there’s something

12:46.199 --> 12:47.868
I’d like to say
to both of you.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.170
I just want to thank you
for letting me stay here.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.305
And as a token
of my appreciation

12:52.338 --> 12:54.374
I want you to have
these watches.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.880
Those look expensive.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.215
Oh, they are.
I bought them in Geneva.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.817

to you for Christmas

have been so good to me

was there...something

to Mary Anne?

Yeah see,
M‐Mary Anne, listen.

have to tell you that...

Well, l‐look,
y‐y‐you just can’t...

...know what a joy it is
having you stay with us.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.474
Uh, Jennifer, I am not
taking sides in this thing.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.277
I’m not the one who invited
Mary Anne to stay here.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.179
No, uh, no, Jennifer,
I’m warning you.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.582
If you hang up on me again,
I am not calling you back.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.083
Hel‐hello?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.890
Cousin, good news!

14:16.923 --> 14:18.592
Balki,
Mary Anne is out of here.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.126
Cousin,
I came up with a plan

14:20.160 --> 14:22.028
to get Jennifer
and Mary Anne back together.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.564
Well, good, then maybe
we can work on a plan

14:23.597 --> 14:25.666
to get Jennifer
and me back together.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.933
Now, what’s your plan?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.334
I reminded Mary Anne that

14:28.368 --> 14:30.270
her television set
was still upstairs

14:30.303 --> 14:32.372
and she went up
to get it!

14:37.443 --> 14:38.979
Cousin, don’t you see?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.515
When Mary Anne walks
in that room

14:41.548 --> 14:44.417
and she sees Jennifer
and they start talking

14:44.450 --> 14:47.588
the floodgates
of friendship will open up

14:47.621 --> 14:51.558
and irrigate them both with
the milk of human kindness!

14:54.961 --> 14:56.496
I don’t believe it!

14:56.530 --> 14:59.566
That witch upstairs changed
the locks on the doors!

15:02.035 --> 15:03.970
Hey,
miss‐have‐a friend‐for‐20‐years

15:04.004 --> 15:05.706
and‐stab‐her‐in‐the‐back!

15:05.739 --> 15:09.275
(Jennifer)
’Yeah, what is it,
beans‐for‐brains?’

15:13.479 --> 15:15.682
I want my television back.

15:15.716 --> 15:17.050
’Fine.’

15:20.120 --> 15:22.322
Well,
I guess I told her.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.558
[clattering]

15:28.695 --> 15:31.131
That does it!
I’ll show her!

15:31.164 --> 15:32.599
(Larry)
Mary Anne,
what are you gonna do?

15:32.633 --> 15:35.201
I’m going to go out
and buy a new television!

15:40.741 --> 15:42.408
It’s a good thing
I didn’t remind

15:42.442 --> 15:44.711
Mary Anne about
her refrigerator.

15:46.212 --> 15:49.282
Alright, Balki, it is time
to take direct action.

15:49.315 --> 15:53.253
‐And I have a plan!
‐Oh, God!

15:53.286 --> 15:54.354
Balki, if we
don’t do something

15:54.387 --> 15:56.657
Jennifer and Mary Anne
may never get back together.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.491
And the two of us are gonna
spend the rest of our lives

15:58.525 --> 16:01.094
with our tray tables
in the upright position!

16:03.063 --> 16:04.297
Let’s hear the plan.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.336
[instrumental music]

16:11.672 --> 16:13.239
(Larry)
’Thanks for understanding,
Jennifer.’

16:13.273 --> 16:15.642
I’m glad
we’re talking again.

16:15.676 --> 16:18.011
Well,
I don’t know, Larry.

16:18.044 --> 16:21.314
I mean, um,
I’m living alone now.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.249
I thought that, um...

16:23.283 --> 16:25.752
...maybe we could
go up to my place

16:25.786 --> 16:29.222
and, um, put on
some soft music

16:29.255 --> 16:31.625
and, uh...

16:31.658 --> 16:33.594
...decide what to do.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.064
Now?

16:40.066 --> 16:41.401
Now.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.370
Okay.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.308
Yeah. Yeah.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.143
Yeah.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.812
No.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.548
No.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.151
No, Jennifer, I‐I‐I really
think it would be better

16:58.184 --> 17:01.688
if, uh, we just
stay here and watch TV.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.633
Wait a minute, you would
rather stay here and watch TV

17:12.665 --> 17:14.601
than go
upstairs with me?

17:22.776 --> 17:24.477
Yeah.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.316
[indistinct chatter]

17:30.350 --> 17:32.753
‐Mary Anne.
‐Jennifer.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.221
Well, isn’t this
the darndest surprise?

17:37.123 --> 17:39.225
Cousin Larry! Jennifer!

17:39.259 --> 17:42.529
Well, slap my face,
and call me Zsa‐Zsa.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.770
Oh, so now I see
what’s going on.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.805
Now, now, hold on, now, now,
come on, come on, now

17:51.838 --> 17:54.240
Jennifer, just a minute.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.748
Not so fast, pilgrim!

18:05.251 --> 18:06.587
Balki, give me the key.

18:06.620 --> 18:09.656
I don’t think so.

18:09.690 --> 18:12.125
‐Ha!
‐Well, then give me the key.

18:12.158 --> 18:15.461
Double ha!
Oh, stop it! Stop it!

18:16.329 --> 18:18.298
Larry, give me the key.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.403
Give it to me,
give it to me.

18:25.806 --> 18:27.140
‐Ha!
‐Ha!

18:28.575 --> 18:30.410
‐Ha!
‐Ha!

18:30.443 --> 18:31.678
‐Ha!
‐Ha!

18:33.179 --> 18:35.849
There, now,
the door is locked

18:35.882 --> 18:38.652
the key is gone,
there’s no way out.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.421
Now, no one is leaving here
until you girls sit down

18:41.454 --> 18:43.824
and get this
mess settled.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.726
Oh, yeah, well,
I’m calling a locksmith

18:45.759 --> 18:47.794
to get me
out of here.

18:47.828 --> 18:50.797
Call two locksmiths.
I want to get out of here too.

18:53.634 --> 18:55.368
Alright, Balki,
we’ve done what we can.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.703
Let’s just forget it.

18:56.737 --> 18:58.939
These two are never
gonna get back together.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.908
Oh, come on, cousin,
You can’t just give up.

19:01.942 --> 19:05.712
Just because two turtle doves
want to fly the coop

19:05.746 --> 19:07.213
don’t mean you make it
easy for them

19:07.247 --> 19:09.215
and buy them
tickets to Miami.

19:10.951 --> 19:12.886
Get me
a locksmith too.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.359
I got to get out of here. I am
tired of this Mypos garbage.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.263
"Every barnyard
has a silver lining."

19:24.731 --> 19:27.267
’Give me a break.’

19:27.300 --> 19:30.236
Well, I was just
trying to be nice...

19:30.270 --> 19:32.205
...something you might
want to try sometime

19:32.238 --> 19:34.174
you big babasticki‐head!

19:38.244 --> 19:40.413
Well, let me
tell you something.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.282
"When you lie
down with sheep...

19:42.315 --> 19:44.250
...you wake up
with ticks."

19:48.989 --> 19:53.493
"Sticks and stones
may hurt Shirley Jones...

19:55.529 --> 19:58.364
...but nerds
will never harm me."

19:59.633 --> 20:01.702
Now, is that supposed
to mean something?

20:01.735 --> 20:04.370
You’ve lived in this country
for four years!

20:04.404 --> 20:06.507
Why don’t you learn
the language?

20:08.609 --> 20:10.476
I know enough
of the language to tell you

20:10.511 --> 20:13.714
what I think of you
in most uncertain terms!

20:15.281 --> 20:16.382
Oh, yeah?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.885
You’re short,
you’re stubborn

20:18.919 --> 20:20.621
and you’re short!

20:24.725 --> 20:27.728
This from a man
who names his shoes.

20:27.761 --> 20:29.730
Well,
if that bothers you

20:29.763 --> 20:32.566
maybe I’ll just
lace up Phil and Andy

20:32.599 --> 20:35.335
and walk
right out of here.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.671
Balki, I can’t believe
you’re doing this.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.607
Guys, guys, you can’t just throw
away a friendship like that.

20:40.641 --> 20:43.476
Why not? I can’t stand
living with this guy.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.011
I’ve dreamed
of living alone.

20:45.045 --> 20:46.379
Get yourself
another roommate.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.616
I will.
Roommates are a dime a dance.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.720
But good friendships aren’t.

20:53.754 --> 20:56.022
You can’t let petty
disagreements break them up.

20:56.056 --> 20:57.290
Petty disagreements?

20:57.323 --> 20:58.224
What, like moving out

20:58.258 --> 21:00.994
because someone insults
your hair color?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.631
That happened
to you too?

21:07.033 --> 21:09.503
Uh, Mary Anne, they’re‐they’re
talking about us.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.738
They’re trying to show
us that we’re letting

21:11.772 --> 21:14.407
petty disagreements
break up a friendship.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.710
Now, come on, girls.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.444
This has gone
on long enough.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.681
It’s time for you
to say you’re sorry.

21:32.726 --> 21:36.396
‐I’m sorry, Mary Anne.
‐I’m sorry, Jennifer.

21:37.931 --> 21:38.932
Oh.

21:43.770 --> 21:46.472
Thanks for showing us
how silly we were.

21:46.507 --> 21:47.574
Oh...

21:49.743 --> 21:51.545
You made it easy.

22:02.455 --> 22:05.826
Hey, good friends
are hard to come by.

22:05.859 --> 22:09.495
Cousin Larry’s right.
We’re all very lucky.

22:09.530 --> 22:11.364
Hey, I got a great idea.

22:11.397 --> 22:14.067
Why don’t we all go out
to dinner, and celebrate?

22:14.100 --> 22:17.771
‐That’s a great idea.
‐But we’re locked in.

22:17.804 --> 22:21.074
No. This is the real key.
