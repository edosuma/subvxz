WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:04.671
Charlie, are you in there?

00:05.381 --> 00:07.048
What? l'm in the shower.

00:07.508 --> 00:11.344
-What?
-What?

00:11.929 --> 00:13.721
Damn it.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.223
What the hell? l'm naked.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.725
You better have
a fistful of singles or get out.

00:17.810 --> 00:21.521
Yeah, whatever. You couldn't hear me.
Now don't look. l gotta pee.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.399
There's two other bathrooms in this house.

00:24.775 --> 00:27.610
Yeah, well, l'm in a hurry
and l got to talk to you.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.363
Can you handle Sam's
sleepover this weekend?

00:31.198 --> 00:33.366
Man. l really wish l could. l have big plans.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.286
Which l'm desperately trying
to come up with even as we speak.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.664
Well, l have actual plans.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.709
A guy invited me to Palm Springs
for the weekend to play golf.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.252
You don't play golf.

00:44.378 --> 00:48.131
He's a cosmetic dentist.
He's rich. l play golf.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.342
No way. This is why we have a schedule.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.762
Okay. l'm going to approach this differently.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.058
That's one.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.644
You're going to scald me into a sleepover?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.730
Let's ask the toilet.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.067
Okay! Okay! Damn you. l'll do it.

01:10.446 --> 01:11.738
What the hell was that for?

01:11.947 --> 01:15.116
That's for covering up
the tattoo of my name on your butt.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.326
l didn't cover it. l just added

01:17.411 --> 01:19.412
"For a good time, call..."
and your phone number.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.581
l don't know who l thought
was going to see it,

01:21.665 --> 01:24.167
but it seemed like a funny idea at the time.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.386
l have a quick little topic l would like
to cover before we break.

01:35.471 --> 01:38.014
Somebody gave me
a negative review on Yelp.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.475
What the hell is Yelp?

01:40.851 --> 01:44.145
lt's the sound you make
when you sit on your balls.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.815
Yes.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.568
lt's also a site where anyone
can review anything anonymously.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.195
The complaint was that l go off topic.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.613
Now, l'm not going to jump
to any conclusions

01:53.697 --> 01:56.491
or make a big deal about it.
So maybe you could just tell me who did it.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.701
l knew it was you!

01:59.536 --> 02:02.163
Actually, it wasn't, but l do think
you're going off topic.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.334
All right, forget the Yelp thing.
l'm just going to let it go.

02:06.668 --> 02:10.463
Anybody have any last things they would
like to discuss? l knew it was you!

02:10.547 --> 02:14.008
No. l'm a little nervous
about a date l got tonight.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.931
l'm sorry. l didn't realize your group was
still in session. l'll go wait in the kitchen.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.098
That's all right, Kate. We're almost done.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.600
Oh, yeah. We're all friends here.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.603
Come on, sit down next to Texas Thunder.

02:27.314 --> 02:31.150
Thanks. l'm just going to grab some
coffee and ride out the storm.

02:31.568 --> 02:35.780
Anyway, l've been dating this girl from work
for about a month now.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.282
You do know that accidentally
walking next to someone

02:38.367 --> 02:41.118
on the way to the bathroom isn't dating?

02:41.203 --> 02:43.871
That is how we met, but now it's real.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.292
So, tonight's our fourth date
and we're in that awkward phase.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.504
Right before she gets weirded out
and doesn't want a fifth date.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.632
Nolan, why so negative?
Things don't have to work out that way.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.717
Have some confidence in yourself.
You're a great guy.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.929
We're not taking
opposing views yet, Patrick.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.391
l just wish l was better at liking myself.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.269
That's one of the things l hate about me.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.647
l really just want this one to work out.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.483
l mean, Athena, she's different than
the girls l usually date.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.986
When you say different,
you mean no angry voicemails,

03:15.070 --> 03:18.698
no drunken tirades, no stealing your car
and using it in a liquor store robbery?

03:19.116 --> 03:21.242
Yeah. Debbie was great,

03:22.619 --> 03:25.079
but Athena is different than that.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.082
And she's a gentle lover in bed.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.501
That's right. We did it.

03:30.586 --> 03:31.711
Sick.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.506
lf for some reason you make it to a fifth date,

03:35.591 --> 03:39.427
l would love to meet this "woman"
and see if she actually exists.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.222
Yeah. Untie her from the radiator
and bring her in.

03:43.891 --> 03:47.810
No. l haven't told her
l'm in anger therapy yet.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.897
l wouldn't really be comfortable
introducing her to the group.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.857
Oh, we'll be nice.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.859
We'll just put her up here on the table,

03:54.943 --> 03:59.196
turn her around a couple of times,
see if she's a good breeding filly.

04:01.533 --> 04:05.202
Because l believe that's the nicest thing
that's going to happen to her here,

04:05.287 --> 04:06.871
l'm going to nip this in the bud.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.041
Nolan, l think you should focus on your
date tonight. So, where are you taking her?

04:10.125 --> 04:14.587
Well, there's that discount sushi truck
l've been trying to catch up with.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.381
Or else just the Merry Peasant for drinks.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.258
l'd go with the Peasant.

04:19.343 --> 04:23.804
l mean, unless you're going to propose,
then definitely go with the poisoned sushi.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.391
You're not really going to do that, right?

04:27.476 --> 04:28.893
Do what?

04:28.977 --> 04:32.313
Show up at the bar to help Nolan get
to the fifth date with that girl.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.814
What are you talking about?

04:34.024 --> 04:37.526
Please, Charlie. Why else would you ask him
where he's going on his date?

04:38.362 --> 04:39.946
lt's for a research paper.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.948
"Places Patients Go On Dates."

04:42.866 --> 04:46.911
lt's a follow-up to my earlier work,
"Bipolar's Guide to Amusement Parks."

04:47.162 --> 04:50.206
You're overly involved in your patients' lives
and it's a big problem.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.208
Look, l'm just gonna pretend
l'm an old buddy

04:52.292 --> 04:54.168
and chat the guy up in front of his date.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.755
Tell her he's solid, dependable, charismatic.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.634
l happen to be a very persuasive,
you know, liar.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.888
Charlie, you have a distant mother
and a critical father,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.849
and that is why you have an overwhelming
need to be loved by everyone.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.309
lncluding your patients.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.104
Or l just want to help my patients
have a healthier life.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.689
l guess you don't.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.941
My God, how do you look
at yourself in the mirror?

05:18.026 --> 05:21.028
Except for the fact
that you're very, very pretty.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.492
So l was thinking, maybe we could go
to the Renaissance fair this weekend.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.327
-Are you free?
-Yeah.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.956
That would be our fifth date, methinks.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.585
But thine would have to drive.
As my car needeth a new belt of timing.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.132
Hey, Nolan.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.718
Charlie. What are you doing here?

05:43.885 --> 05:46.220
l just stopped by for a drink. Hi, l'm Charlie.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.764
This is Athena. Athena, this is Charlie.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.516
-Hi, Charlie.
-Hi.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.269
l don't want to bother you two.
Looks like you're having fun.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.479
Obviously, everybody has fun with Nolan.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.773
Solid, dependable, charismatic Nolan.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.234
We have a great time
whenever we're hanging out.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.610
So how do you guys know each other?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.238
Charlie's my... Urologist.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.283
Really? You're his penis doctor?

06:08.535 --> 06:11.287
Yes. Because that's what a urologist is.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.835
-So my penis is fine, right?
-lt's delightful.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.965
Excuse me.
There's a guy at the bar who's really lit,

06:23.050 --> 06:24.800
and he's pissed because l had to cut him off.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.343
l think l need your professional skills.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.596
Oh, my God.
ls something wrong with his penis?

06:29.639 --> 06:30.681
l'm off the clock, Brett.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.349
Maybe you should call the cops
and go handle it.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.519
No. You're an anger management
therapist and you're right here.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.773
Wait. ls that how you know him?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.443
Were you just lying to me?
Are you in anger therapy?

06:42.778 --> 06:45.196
Well, maybe. Kind of. Yeah.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.742
l'm just going to handle this myself.

06:52.496 --> 06:53.496
l can't believe this.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.956
-Athena, it's not what you think.
-lt is exactly what l think.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.084
Someone lied to me, right to my face.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.796
Don't call me. Don't come over. We're done.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.094
Okay. Before you say anything,
let me just say...

07:08.845 --> 07:09.929
Dinner's on me.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.560
Whatever plans you have today, break them.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.396
That's a problem because my plan
today was to break all my plans.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.941
Now l'm confused.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.819
-Here.
-What are these?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.946
Spaces available for your new office.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.824
Why? Are they bulldozing my living room
and putting in a new shopping mall?

07:31.159 --> 07:34.161
You know how you're not supposed to work
in your bed because it's where you sleep?

07:34.412 --> 07:37.164
l don't know if l agree.
l think l do some of my best work in bed.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.250
Yes, you do.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.920
You show up whenever you're supposed to
and you keep a tidy workspace

07:43.004 --> 07:44.964
and you've gone 1 1 0 days
without an accident.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.093
My point is, having patients in your home

07:49.177 --> 07:50.636
makes you feel like they're your family.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.681
And that just encourages you to get
over-involved in their lives.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.393
Will you stop worrying about that?
l'm telling you, it's not a problem for me.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.602
lt is.

07:58.687 --> 08:02.148
You almost went to the bar last night to
make sure that your patient had a good date.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.191
l didn't almost go to the bar.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.194
-So you went to the bar?
-Yes.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.197
-And it went badly?
-No.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.701
-lt went horribly?
-Yes.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.497
That's Nolan and Athena.
l'm going to help get them back together.

08:18.582 --> 08:19.874
You are in complete denial.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.168
Well, maybe, but it's better
than partial denial.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.712
That's so wishy-washy.
l say go big or go home.

08:27.382 --> 08:31.010
l'm so sorry. l overreacted. l do that a lot.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.638
That's okay. Most people think you
have to be angry to be in anger therapy,

08:34.723 --> 08:36.974
but there are lots of other related issues.
Like Nolan's.

08:37.309 --> 08:41.270
You can't lump people together.
Not all the Vikings raped and pillaged.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.731
Some of them just liked sailing.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.984
You know what, Nolan?
Those rape analogies don't always work,

08:47.068 --> 08:48.944
but that one is on the money.

08:49.404 --> 08:53.532
l just want you to know that l'm here for you
on yourjourney. Ourjourney.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.411
l feel so much better.
Now l don't have to hide anything.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.871
Thank you, Charlie.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.831
l love you, man.

09:02.751 --> 09:06.086
l'm getting a little emotional.
l'll be right back.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.174
Are we done?

09:11.009 --> 09:13.260
As soon as Nolan
gets back from the bathroom.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.888
-l guess you can go.
-Really? Thanks.

09:17.933 --> 09:21.769
-Did l say something wrong?
-No, you're a therapist. You're God.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.688
Well, we better go.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.483
lf we leave now,
we can still make the Renaissance fair.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.362
Thanks again for taking the time to
explain everything to me

09:31.446 --> 09:35.324
so that Nolan and l could get back together.
l won't forget this.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.286
Do you blink? l don't think you blink.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.456
l don't want to miss anything. See ya.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.714
-Hey, Nolan.
-Hey.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.299
Sent you a couple of emails,
didn't hear anything back.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.634
-ls everything all right?
-Yeah.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.719
l was over at Athena's and l went
to the bathroom,

09:55.804 --> 09:59.098
and when l came back,
my computer was smashed on the floor.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.349
Athena said her cat did it.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.937
-Her cat?
-Yeah. l mean, her cat's real crazy.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.482
l guess he was playing with my phone
and erased all my old girlfriends' numbers.

10:09.317 --> 10:13.028
Nolan, l've never had a cat,
so maybe l'm alarmed for nothing.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.864
lt sounds like you, me and Athena
need to have another session.

10:16.074 --> 10:19.410
Not necessary. l actually want to talk
about Athena in group today.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.786
That's very healthy. Let's get started.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.831
Okay.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.833
Wait. Where's Ed?

10:26.167 --> 10:29.378
Turns out he was the one
who complained about me on Yelp.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.171
Apparently, he also complained
about the Patriot Act.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.256
So now he's down at the federal building

10:32.340 --> 10:34.008
trying to prove
he's not a Honduran national.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.928
Now, l think Nolan has something
he'd like to share.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.849
Thanks, Charlie. l'm leaving the group.
Bye, everybody.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.184
Okay, cool. My turn.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.520
Hold on. Hold on, Patrick.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.272
What do you mean you're leaving, Nolan?

10:49.107 --> 10:50.983
Well, last night,
Athena was explaining to me

10:51.067 --> 10:54.862
how inappropriate it is for my therapist
to be meddling in a patient's personal life.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.449
And she really knows because she's been
in therapy a bunch of times.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.284
l mean, a lot.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.078
What was she in therapy for?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.039
She said it's very complicated

11:05.165 --> 11:09.376
and that the records were burned
in an unexplained fire in her foster home.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.544
lt's weird, huh?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.922
But here's the good news.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.342
We're moving in together.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.385
Bye, everybody.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.765
At the risk of being too involved
in your personal life,

11:22.849 --> 11:24.892
do you really feel you know her well enough
to move in with her?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.144
Athena said you'd say the exact same thing.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.063
She's pretty much right about everything.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.315
She said l don't need
to go to therapy anymore

11:31.399 --> 11:33.901
because she can tell me what to do.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.321
Nolan, from what l'm hearing,
we need to keep talking.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.491
This is a terrible time for you to
leave therapy, but this is group.

11:40.575 --> 11:41.784
Why don't we hear what
the group has to say?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.660
Okay. l'll go first.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.831
Nolan, there are so many issues,
l don't even know where to start.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.918
One. l'm amazed you even know
how to get here by yourself.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.755
Two. Who would want you with that hair?

11:55.507 --> 11:58.675
Three. Think with your head,
not with your wiener.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.928
Four. Who would want you with that shirt?

12:03.306 --> 12:05.057
-Five...
-All right, Lacey.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.062
But you did say something in there
that made sense.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.438
-The wiener thing? l knew it.
-Yes.

12:13.441 --> 12:17.236
Nolan, l think your feelings for Athena
may be clouding yourjudgment.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.029
She didn't push me into anything.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.782
She said to take my time
and really think about it.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.623
That's Athena. She misses me.

12:32.335 --> 12:36.505
l gotta go get her stuff from her
ex-boyfriend's place while he's still at work.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.469
You've got to help him, Charlie.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.848
lt's like watching a baby possum
crossing the road at night.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.101
l've hit so many.
l can't watch another one die.

12:51.062 --> 12:55.732
Well, then you might want to rinse off
your bumper 'cause here comes a big one.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.612
Hey, Charlie.
l felt bad about bailing on you this weekend,

13:00.697 --> 13:03.031
so l brought over some snacks
for the sleepover.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.493
Thanks. l would have done it myself,
but l got a lot of crap going on.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.915
Condoms? Am l expected to provide
sex partners for all these girls?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.168
Those are mine.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.212
Strawberry flavored?
Your rich cosmetic dentist

13:17.297 --> 13:19.214
-is not going to like the sugar in these.
-Charlie!

13:19.299 --> 13:21.300
You know, four out of five dentists
recommend sugarless condoms

13:21.384 --> 13:23.218
for their patients who chew condoms.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.431
Don't give me crap
about going away with this guy.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.267
l already feel bad enough
missing Sam's sleepover.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.227
Tell me about guilt.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.855
l tried to help a patient with his girlfriend
and l broke them up.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.316
Then l get them back together
and it turns out she's unstable.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.194
You know, this feels really nice,
like old times.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.862
Talking about your problems,

13:42.030 --> 13:44.281
and if l wasn't on my way
to screw some guy in Palm Desert,

13:44.365 --> 13:46.116
l would so stay and help you work it out.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.620
l understand.
You have to trap a man into loving you.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.705
-l get it.
-Thank you.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.877
Hey, how's it going?

13:56.961 --> 13:59.338
They're texting about how lame this is.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.673
-How do you know?
-They're texting me.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.302
ls there anything l can do to help?

14:05.637 --> 14:07.888
-How about some Pictionary?
-No, no.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.390
Fun stuff is supposed
to happen spontaneously.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.896
Oh, my God, look.
lt's Pictionary for no reason.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.526
Katelyn with a "K" wants you to leave
because you're annoying.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.029
And Caitlyn with a "C" says
you're not annoying, just boring.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.866
l think l know why she spells it with a "C."

14:31.412 --> 14:33.622
Hello? Nolan, how are you?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.333
-Are you okay?
-Pretty good.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.754
l'm at the Sun Valley
Battered Women's Shelter.

14:41.756 --> 14:42.756
You're what?

14:43.299 --> 14:44.716
lt was the nearest place that could take me.

14:44.801 --> 14:49.096
Turns out Athena has anger issues.
Could have used a heads-up on that.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.599
l am so sorry, Nolan. Where's Athena now?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.476
She took off. The police are looking for her.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.436
Can you please pick me up?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.730
Be kind of hard for me right now,

14:58.815 --> 15:00.816
and l'm not sure
it would be appropriate, Nolan.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.442
lsn't there anybody else you can call?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.319
l tried Lacey, but she didn't pick up.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.948
ls there anybody you can call that
actually cares about you?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.700
That's why l called you.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.203
Look, l can't go back to my house.
l gave a key to Athena.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.039
lt's kind of ironic
because she stuck it in my eye.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.084
-Look, Nolan...
-l need a ride quick!

15:21.212 --> 15:23.589
They're not exactly pro-dude here.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.926
Of course l'll be there. You just hang tight
at the shelter. l'm on my way.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.722
What the hell is going on?
Why is somebody at a shelter?

15:31.806 --> 15:35.392
And why is there no pizza?
l thought this was a sleepover.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.979
One of my patients
got beat up by his girlfriend.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.065
Look, l'm in a bind here. l need you to
do me a favor and watch the girls...

15:42.150 --> 15:43.317
No!

15:43.651 --> 15:45.527
l can't bring all these girls
to a battered women's shelter.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.653
Their parents will crucify me.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.031
But you can leave them
with the beer-drinking neighbor

15:49.115 --> 15:52.909
who had a pot brownie about an hour
ago and is still feeling pretty good?

15:53.578 --> 15:55.078
Okay, Cheech.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.039
Just hang here and help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.749
There's egg salad and leftover sloppy Joes.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.252
Awesome.
l'm going to make myself an eggy Joe.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.132
Would you guys mind if l left for about
an hour to run an errand?

16:07.592 --> 16:10.302
l don't know.
l don't trust myself with liquor in the house.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.513
Okay. Who wants to go to ln-N-Out Burger?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.517
-l want to go.
-Eat your eggy Joe.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.228
All right. On the way back,
l got to make a quick stop

16:20.313 --> 16:21.938
to grab a buddy of mine and all l ask

16:22.023 --> 16:23.857
is that you don't tell your parents
about this little detour.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.859
Are we going on a drug run?

16:25.943 --> 16:27.444
No. We're not going on a drug run.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.655
-l want to go.
-l said we're not going on a drug run!

16:29.739 --> 16:31.782
Eat your goddamn eggy Joe!

16:35.578 --> 16:36.912
Sorry, kids.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.630
-What happened to your face?
-l'll answer that, Nolan.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.049
He had an accident giving his cat a bath.

16:49.926 --> 16:53.929
Yeah, Whiskers can be pretty ferocious
when she's been drinking.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.640
Why were you at a women's shelter?

16:58.393 --> 17:02.896
Okay. l think it's time to tell them the truth
about what really happened to you.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.566
Nolan is a reporter for Time magazine.

17:07.777 --> 17:11.113
Doing an expose on what it's like
to be a man living in a women's shelter.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.407
Then he walked into a door.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.868
You must be a pretty crappy therapist

17:16.953 --> 17:19.746
if you don't know
domestic abuse when you see it.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.877
Ruby's right.
Nolan is a victim of domestic abuse.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.839
l'm really sorry everybody had to
be involved in this.

17:28.923 --> 17:31.091
lt's all my fault, l should have known.

17:31.259 --> 17:35.011
You don't unload a dishwasher
while someone's on the phone.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.933
Check it out.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.644
Your daughter and her friends
did some makeup on me.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.272
Turns out l have combination skin.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.235
-Lacey. What are you doing here?
-You texted me.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.696
Oh, you mean, why do l care?

17:52.780 --> 17:55.323
You know, Charlie's always saying
we should give a crap about each other.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.242
l'm touched, Lacey.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.787
Yeah, well, l figured l'd try it once
to get you off my ass.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.539
So where's the bitch that hit you?

18:03.166 --> 18:05.292
l don't know. She hasn't texted me back yet.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.669
What... What? You texted her?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.088
l didn't want her to worry.

18:10.715 --> 18:14.342
Dad, there's some woman outside the
house yelling for Nolan. l think she's drunk.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.304
-How do you know that?
-She keeps yelling, "l'm drunk."

18:18.639 --> 18:20.557
Crap. All right.
Take all your friends upstairs.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.435
Tell them there's 20 bucks in it for every kid
who doesn't text their parents.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.561
lf they give you any lip, go to 30.

18:27.482 --> 18:28.732
Okay, okay. Just wait here.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.609
l'm going to go out there
and try to talk her down

18:30.693 --> 18:32.235
before this thing gets
any further out of control.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.489
-l got this.
-Lacey! Lacey!

18:35.990 --> 18:39.242
Nolan baby, come outside.
l just want to talk to you!

18:39.327 --> 18:41.411
Yeah, well, l want to talk to you, too!

18:41.496 --> 18:45.665
Slow down. Nothing was ever solved
by hitting someone with a giant spoon.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.959
l'm responsible for this.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.211
l'm the one who has to do
something about it.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.462
-Get out here!
-You're right.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.672
You should be doing something.
Here, hold my earrings.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.550
Lacey. You don't understand
how mean she is.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.843
She's drunk. She'll kill you.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.221
Take the big fork, too.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.890
Lacey, sit down.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.352
-Baby, l just wanna see you!
-Nolan, listen to me. l get it now.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.562
l don't care if you like me
or hate me anymore.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.107
Watching you stand here, ready to let
Lacey go out and fight for you with cutlery,

19:11.192 --> 19:12.484
no matter how big...

19:13.486 --> 19:14.778
ls the last straw.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.614
-l failed you as a therapist.
-Nolan!

19:17.698 --> 19:20.325
So, l'm going to go out there,
get rid ofAthena,

19:20.409 --> 19:22.285
then you're going to find a new therapist
who can help you.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.578
-Nolan.
-Wait.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.539
-Come out!
-Give me the spoon.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.834
You're not going out there.
Charlie's not going out there.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.127
l'm the only one going out there

19:31.212 --> 19:32.963
and l can only be stopped with a kiss.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.550
l'm not going to kiss you. Charlie, you?

19:36.759 --> 19:39.511
l think it would send the wrong message.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.265
Okay. Here l go.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.269
Baby, l miss you.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.145
You're really going
to let him go out there alone?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.523
You know what? He really needs to do this.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.571
See? They're talking.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.240
She's turning around.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.576
Walking to her car.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.912
She's getting in. Now she's driving away.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.332
And now she's turning around.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.878
Now she's chasing Nolan.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.796
Call the cops. l got to go.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.466
Drop the spoon and run, man!

20:26.225 --> 20:28.852
Hey. l'm not getting strawberry.
They're like Otter Pops.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.937
They all taste the same.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.274
So anyway,

20:36.611 --> 20:39.029
Lacey grabs a giant spoon
to go after Athena,

20:39.113 --> 20:40.614
but Nolan stopped her and went outside

20:40.740 --> 20:43.158
and got chased up a tree
by a Toyota 4Runner.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.119
And this all happened in front of
a bunch of screaming little girls.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.830
Well, l think l know what
the giant spoon represents.

20:48.956 --> 20:52.083
No, no, no. This wasn't a dream.
lt actually happened.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.461
So what was the final outcome?

20:54.962 --> 20:57.714
Well, you were right and l was right.
l inspired Lacey with my methods,

20:57.798 --> 20:59.716
but l inspired Nolan with yours.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.593
But by using your methods,
l made them mine.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.887
So it was a total victory for me.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.139
Good for you.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.099
Now, if you want another victory tonight,

21:08.184 --> 21:13.188
you're going to have to give it to yourself.
Here's banana. Tastes like strawberry.
