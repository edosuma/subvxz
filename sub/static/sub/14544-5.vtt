00:17.023 --> 00:20.732
What do the doctors say?
Will she be okay?

00:20.827 --> 00:24.798
They don't know.
They are doing all they can.

00:24.898 --> 00:28.345
That's terrible.
I don't know what to say.

00:28.435 --> 00:31.109
- Have you seen Malin?
- Yes, I've met with her.

00:31.204 --> 00:33.810
- What does she say?
- She's a fighter.

00:33.907 --> 00:35.887
She's lying there
with tubes everywhere.

00:35.975 --> 00:37.249
She's not giving up.

00:37.344 --> 00:39.017
- Do you know what she said?
- No?

01:34.401 --> 01:37.314
You can imagine
how it must have looked...

02:37.530 --> 02:40.136
How do you say "sick leave"?

02:51.578 --> 02:53.387
Yes... No...

03:32.480 --> 03:35.800
FITTING IN

05:42.081 --> 05:44.527
If you get burned out
just from sanding floors,

05:44.617 --> 05:47.461
they must be
damn good-looking floors.

05:47.553 --> 05:49.590
That's for sure.

05:49.689 --> 05:51.896
Do you have any idea when it is?

05:51.991 --> 05:53.971
- When what is?
- The party?

05:54.060 --> 05:55.903
No, I don't.

05:55.995 --> 05:57.565
I'll call and find out.

06:02.735 --> 06:06.683
Hey, I'm here with Emma.
What time is the party Thursday?

06:08.241 --> 06:10.881
Yes.

06:10.977 --> 06:12.979
Yeah.

06:13.079 --> 06:16.026
Yep. Yep. Bye.

06:18.785 --> 06:23.063
No, she didn't know when it was.

06:26.726 --> 06:28.797
What?

06:28.895 --> 06:32.433
How can she not know
what time her own party is?

06:32.532 --> 06:34.842
What's going on in Emma's head?

06:34.934 --> 06:36.607
Mom, cut out the psychobabble.

06:36.703 --> 06:38.444
I can tell somethings wrong.

06:38.538 --> 06:40.484
Nothing is wrong.
I feel great.

06:41.741 --> 06:44.517
- And Bruce?
- Stop taking notes!

06:44.610 --> 06:46.556
Bruce is good. He just has
a little problem with the language.

06:46.646 --> 06:49.490
It's going to take forever.

06:49.582 --> 06:51.084
What is?

06:51.184 --> 06:54.063
For Bruce to fit in.

06:54.153 --> 06:56.497
He's not making much of an effort.

06:56.589 --> 06:57.431
Sure, he is.

06:57.523 --> 07:00.732
He studies Swedish with a friend
almost every day.

07:00.827 --> 07:02.431
You mean Hassan?

07:02.528 --> 07:03.836
Yes.

07:03.930 --> 07:06.672
But why doesn't he have
Swedish friends?

07:06.766 --> 07:09.144
I've heard him say
two Swedish words:

07:09.235 --> 07:12.307
"tack" and "semla."

07:12.405 --> 07:14.715
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

07:14.807 --> 07:18.516
Oh, yeah.
He can say "bågsåg," too.

07:21.614 --> 07:23.184
That you can write down
in your notes.

10:01.941 --> 10:04.512
- Hi, Emma!
- Hello, Lisa. What is up?

10:04.610 --> 10:06.954
It is Bruce here.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.822
Wow, I'm impressed
that you're calling.

10:14.754 --> 10:15.630
Listen...

10:15.721 --> 10:18.725
I do not mean to trouble you,

10:18.824 --> 10:22.033
but I heard there is a party Thursday.

10:22.128 --> 10:23.801
It sounds very fun!

10:24.764 --> 10:28.678
I don't know if I'd call it a party,
more like a...

10:28.768 --> 10:31.476
small get-together.

10:31.570 --> 10:35.279
Thank you very much, Lisa.
We will gladly come to your party.

10:41.013 --> 10:43.425
Bye, Lisa.
I will see you later.

10:43.516 --> 10:45.189
Bye!

10:59.598 --> 11:00.599
Hi, Mom!

11:44.443 --> 11:46.116
Really?

12:47.239 --> 12:48.047
Here you go.

13:26.011 --> 13:27.922
Put everything on this card.

13:37.056 --> 13:38.797
Thanks.

13:38.891 --> 13:41.394
Is the tip included?
Thanks.

13:43.028 --> 13:44.200
Thanks.

13:44.296 --> 13:45.934
- Thank you very much.
- Come on.

15:04.043 --> 15:06.284
Hi! Good to see you!

15:06.378 --> 15:07.516
- Hi!
- Hi!

15:08.914 --> 15:12.259
- How are you?
- I'm very well. Are you okay?

15:28.167 --> 15:29.669
No.

17:00.326 --> 17:03.796
Don't get upset, honey,
but the floor is scratched.

17:05.597 --> 17:09.272
Who the hell is wearing shoes
in here?

19:49.194 --> 19:51.470
Gustaf, can you come help me?

19:51.563 --> 19:52.633
What do you want, Mommy?

19:52.731 --> 19:54.210
I clicked the wrong button.

19:54.299 --> 19:58.304
I accepted one of those
idiotic "friend" requests.

19:58.403 --> 20:00.280
Can you help me, Gustaf?

20:05.444 --> 20:07.253
Just do like this.
Watch and learn.

20:07.346 --> 20:10.953
Fantastic.
You're so smart, darling.

20:11.049 --> 20:13.086
Happy that's fixed.
