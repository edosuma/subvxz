- Hi, Angie.
- Jim Roberts.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.915
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.417
Are you a doctor yourself?

02:20.441 --> 02:21.918
- Well, kind of.
- Yeah.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.587
I have an academic interest...

02:23.611 --> 02:24.821
Oh wow.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.689
- In the field, yes.
- I can tell.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.591
Yes.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.693
I can, I can introduce you
to him if you'd like.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.860

02:43.964 --> 02:45.775
Let me tell you about Julie.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.778
Ah, by the time I'd met her,

02:48.802 --> 02:50.204
she'd been in a,

02:52.873 --> 02:56.277
a mental hospital or a
bin for nine years.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.280
She was mostly mute.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.452
She was labeled a
chronic schizophrenic.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.365
When she did speak,

03:08.389 --> 03:11.935
she spoke in what's
called schizophrenise

03:11.959 --> 03:14.295
which is a language which is

03:16.464 --> 03:18.975
apparently nonsensical,

03:18.999 --> 03:21.945
but if anyone does
actually look,

03:21.969 --> 03:25.406
care to look, it does
actually make sense.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.020
Anyway, she had a very difficult

03:31.044 --> 03:33.447
relationship with her mother,

03:35.749 --> 03:40.388
who only responded positively
when Julie behaved perfectly,

03:41.955 --> 03:44.668
so Julie never had
any difficulties

03:44.692 --> 03:47.795
with eating or
sleeping or teething,

03:48.862 --> 03:49.997
potty training,

03:53.033 --> 03:54.478
walking or talking.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.846
She was like an automaton.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.808
But she felt that her true
self was being murdered.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.522
"I wasn't mothered,
I was smothered."

04:05.546 --> 04:07.591
"She wasn't a mother,
she was killing me,"

04:07.615 --> 04:10.560
"she was cutting out my tongue."

04:10.584 --> 04:11.885
Because her mother

04:14.555 --> 04:17.301
didn't let her develop,
to become independent,

04:17.325 --> 04:21.394
Julie saw her as a
destructive black sun

04:22.596 --> 04:24.365
blocking out all life.

04:27.868 --> 04:28.936
- Freak!

04:30.504 --> 04:32.015
- Give me the knife.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.450
Put it down.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.752
Raymond, put it down.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.986
Raymond put it,

04:37.010 --> 04:38.512
drop it!

04:45.586 --> 04:46.586
Come on.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.803
Alright?

04:53.827 --> 04:55.672
You alright?

04:55.696 --> 04:58.375
Yeah.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.676
Shall we?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.546
Come on, good man, let's go.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.570
That's it.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.377
Well we're all here to
support each other,

05:10.544 --> 05:13.747
so that, you know, but
that also means you can,

05:16.083 --> 05:20.630
you can decide to engage or
not engage as you see fit.

05:20.654 --> 05:25.502
Everyone has their own space
which they can retreat to.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.604
You have your own private space

05:27.628 --> 05:29.406
that you can get away?

05:29.430 --> 05:33.810
Everyone does, everyone
here has their own space.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.078
Mm, that's nice.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.481
I think that's important,

05:37.505 --> 05:40.850
to give that sense of security.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.644
We're very much one
community, one,

05:45.078 --> 05:47.924
one group of people
living together

05:47.948 --> 05:49.049
as best we can.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.529
But sometimes you need to,

05:52.553 --> 05:55.465
you need to be able
to be by yourself.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.967
I think that's important.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.869
Why did you say mothers

05:59.893 --> 06:02.939
make their children
schizophrenic?

06:02.963 --> 06:04.598
I get angry when
people misquote me.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.144
I never said all mothers
make their children

06:08.168 --> 06:11.481
schizophrenic, I never
said all families are bad,

06:11.505 --> 06:12.840
despite what those fuckers say.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.785
Which fuckers?

06:15.809 --> 06:18.111
Those fuckers out to get me.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.654
Raymond is enjoying
some role play.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.767
He's Jesus, I'm Pontius Pilate.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.551
He thinks I am going to
wash my hands of him,

06:32.575 --> 06:34.538
which I won't do.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.706
What's wrong with him?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.730
Ask him.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.651
There are many
people like Raymond

06:47.675 --> 06:49.686
claiming to be the messiah

06:49.710 --> 06:54.448
and they are incarcerated,
electrocuted,

06:55.048 --> 06:59.028
drugged, restrained,
imprisoned against their will.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.765
Why was he in prison?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.229
Nah, it's not prison
it's a hospital.

07:03.253 --> 07:04.568
Oh.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.136
It's meant to be a
cure not a punishment.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.529
I had no idea.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.809
Is it true you don't
prescribe any drugs?

07:12.833 --> 07:16.513
No tranquilizers, no, no
sedatives of any kind

07:16.537 --> 07:18.515
designed to deaden the mind.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.983
And her?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.207
She does have a name you know.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.010
Maria?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.482
Maria, do you want to come
talk to our friend here?

07:33.687 --> 07:35.956
Maria gave birth to a wee boy,

07:37.791 --> 07:40.169
and what should have
been a happy time

07:40.193 --> 07:42.639
became something very unhappy

07:42.663 --> 07:45.642
and she descended into darkness

07:45.666 --> 07:47.276
and she was diagnosed

07:47.300 --> 07:50.571
with what we call
postpartum depression.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.588
Bless you my child.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.191
Maria is a high priestess.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.742
What do you do with
someone like Raymond?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.810
What would you like me to do?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.203
Well, he frightens me.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.239
So he should be locked up
because you're afraid?

08:36.616 --> 08:38.719
He's banishing your demons.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.131
You need to come visit us again.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.300
Oh, I'd like that.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.226
It was very interesting.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.940
Is that good interesting
or bad interesting?

08:50.964 --> 08:53.142
Interesting's a very
interesting word.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.178
I found it quite humbling.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.846
Truth be told.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.639
Well that's alright.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.677
Come on then.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.371
Hello?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.297
- Yeah.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.910
Is this Dr. Laing?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.244
Speaking.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.648
Hi, erm, my name is Angie Wood.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.982
Mm hmm.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.985
Jim Roberts gave me your number.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.155
Does Jim think you
need to come see me?

09:39.179 --> 09:42.025
No, I was at your
lecture actually.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.893
Will you be coming to any
more of my lectures?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.394
Erm, I, I don't know.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.932
I, I was so impressed
by, by what you said.

09:48.956 --> 09:53.803
I'm a postgraduate student
of psychology at Columbia.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.371
- Mm hmm.
- In New York.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.841
I know where it is, yeah.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.843
Of course you do,
it's in New York.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.845
I'm so stupid.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.647
No not at all, you
sound charming,

10:03.671 --> 10:06.315
you sound like someone I should
probably be having lunch with.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.876
Yeah, Jim said you'd
say that too.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.722
You know Lexington Street?

10:12.746 --> 10:14.057
Yeah, sure.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.761
♪ So tired, tired of waiting

10:17.785 --> 10:22.355
♪ Tired of waiting for you

10:24.291 --> 10:25.935
You must be Angie.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.304
Hi. Oh.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.373
What, are you made
of electricity?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.408
You want me to answer
that as a scientist

10:32.432 --> 10:34.010
or a psychiatrist?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.803
Sorry, I'm just a
little nervous.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.782
Something to drink?

10:38.806 --> 10:41.141
- Just some Chianti.
- Very good.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.087
So why are we here?

10:44.111 --> 10:47.190
Well I was so impressed
and just amazed

10:47.214 --> 10:51.118
at your lecture, and Jim said
you'd meet me if I asked, so.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.298
I guess you already
know that part.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.332
Would you like to try?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.191
I'm sure that's fine.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.732
First of the day.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.818
How well do you know Jim?

11:14.842 --> 11:16.602
Oh, he's the first and
only time I've met him

11:16.626 --> 11:18.021
was at your lecture.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.758
My PHD is on gestalt therapy
and that kind of thing.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.161
And I've just, I've read
so much about your work

11:25.185 --> 11:26.429
and your books.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.865
But not actually
read any of 'em?

11:28.889 --> 11:33.169
Well, I've been
meaning to, I just...

11:33.193 --> 11:37.907
Well at least you were
impressed, amazed at my lecture.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.468
You're not taking me
very seriously are you?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.058
We won't be eating.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.178
- Here.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.925
Here, here?

12:28.949 --> 12:30.383
Aye, this is home.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.863
I thought you just worked here.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.188
Well, that too.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.508
A little girl of 17
in a mental hospital

12:45.532 --> 12:49.212
told me she was terrified
because the atom bomb

12:49.236 --> 12:50.337
was inside her.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.883
That is a delusion.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.552
The statesmen of the world
who boast and threaten

12:56.576 --> 12:59.956
that they have doomsday weapons
are far more dangerous

12:59.980 --> 13:03.492
and far more estranged from
reality than many of the people

13:03.516 --> 13:06.920
on whom they label
psychotic is affixed.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.990
Not wrong though am I?

13:11.992 --> 13:15.471
Normal fucking man has
killed 100 million

13:15.495 --> 13:19.166
of his fellow normal man
in the last 50 years.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.370
Whatever happened to her?

13:25.038 --> 13:26.249
Long time ago.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.085
I don't know, she
might still be there.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.420
Couldn't she come here?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.513
I mean, maybe she could
get some help here?

13:35.916 --> 13:37.460
Hang around, you'll find out.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.428
Oh I bet you say that
to all the girls.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.587
Aye, I do.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.568
Sorry, I'm already late.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.270
Patient?

13:47.294 --> 13:50.130
No, my kids are
down from Glasgow.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.878
Children?

13:54.902 --> 13:57.881
I didn't, I didn't realize
you were married.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.139
You didn't ask.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.352
So your wife...

14:03.376 --> 14:06.923
If it makes you feel any
better we're gettin' divorced.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.015
No, doesn't.

14:09.616 --> 14:13.196
What, you'd rather sleep
with a happily married man?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.388
Please don't twist my words.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.535
So, why are you
getting divorced?

14:19.559 --> 14:22.405
Because we don't love each other

14:22.429 --> 14:24.073
or even like each other anymore.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.574
And the children?

14:25.598 --> 14:29.202
Do you, do you not love or
even like them anymore?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.381
I love my children.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.942
If you loved them you'd stay.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.454
What the fuck do you know?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.957
I've read about the effects
of divorce on children.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.926
Well then you'll
know that growing up

14:42.950 --> 14:46.653
in a so-called fucking happy
family can destroy some people.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.433
I've seen what families
do to each other

14:50.457 --> 14:52.217
and I'm not puttin' my
children through that.

14:52.241 --> 14:53.302
A coward walks away.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.595
No, a brave man walks away.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.467
I'm sorry.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.721
No!

16:25.585 --> 16:29.732
Mrs. Holding, I, I know
it looks dreadful,

16:29.756 --> 16:31.600
but let me assure you.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.702
You can't even tell
me how it works.

16:33.726 --> 16:34.726
No.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.242
No, you're right, I can't.

16:39.266 --> 16:43.203
That's because we don't
know exactly why it works.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.384
But believe me, it does work.

16:48.408 --> 16:52.345
And it will work for John,
if he's allowed to stay.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.062
Well, think of it a little

16:59.086 --> 17:02.631
like mending a broken
radio by giving it

17:02.655 --> 17:05.134
a firm slap on the hand.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.835
But Johns not a radio.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.461
He's my son.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.265
It hurts him, and
he isn't better.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.446
What are you thinking?

17:18.471 --> 17:21.117
A visit to a mental institution,

17:21.141 --> 17:24.487
book signing, you know,
that kinda thing.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.289
What a week, two weeks, what?

17:26.313 --> 17:27.723
Yeah something like that.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.525
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.760
You know, radio, TV.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.829
I'm going to have to call
you back about all this.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.564
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.100
Yeah, if you could call
me back, that'd be great.

17:37.124 --> 17:37.800
Yeah, we'll speak soon,
we'll speak soon.

17:37.824 --> 17:38.801
Okay, cool.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.137
- Okay, bye.
- Bye bye.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.239
So I was thinking I could

17:43.263 --> 17:47.243
maybe make this place
more kinda homey.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.501
You still here?

17:51.204 --> 17:53.206
What did you have in mind?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.885
Well, would you like
it to be more homey?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.379
I have to forgive you first.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.481
That's true.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.921
Oh, I see.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.236
I don't want you
moving anything.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.703
Don't fucking move anything.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.439
I won't touch a thing.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.142
Everything is in a
very particular place.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.343
Is it?

18:20.367 --> 18:22.778
You'll note my
filing system here.

18:22.802 --> 18:23.802
It's very...

18:24.837 --> 18:26.182
It's very unique.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.740
Worked out to a micron.

18:36.683 --> 18:37.683
Raymond.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.420
Raymond, Raymond.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.333
Follow your breathing,

18:44.357 --> 18:46.359
follow your breath, yeah?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.364
That's it.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.466
That's it.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.852
Mr. And Mrs. Holding.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.254
John?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.413
Do you want to come through?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.220
Hello, Raymond.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.560
This way.

20:06.773 --> 20:07.773
John.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.848
Mr. and Mrs. Holding.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.895
I'm Dr. Laing.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.256
I believe you've already met Dr.
Zemmell.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.925
He hears voices.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.664
Or at least we think he does.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.983
I think Dr. Meredith
means well but I...

20:41.007 --> 20:42.709
So why are we here?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.385
I'll be honest.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.590
I have great concerns
about leaving John here.

20:59.326 --> 21:03.763
We saw somebody eating
what looked like cat food.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.743
Some people say

21:07.767 --> 21:09.602
you are experimenting
on your patients.

21:10.903 --> 21:16.309
But I want John to be safe,
not in a mental hospital.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.785
I know I can't help him at home.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.000
According to Dr. Meredith,

21:32.024 --> 21:34.694
you're a catatonic
schizophrenic.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.978
John, could you at least
tell me what you want?

21:43.002 --> 21:45.013
I want my own room.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.640
And what will you do in there?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.523
John, we will be able
to give you a room,

21:54.547 --> 21:57.125
although here we
call them cells.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.887
Erm, from the Latin cellar,
sort of a small room where a,

22:04.123 --> 22:05.443
like where a nun
or a monk sleeps.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.634
We'll take it from there,
does that sound okay?

22:11.531 --> 22:12.531
Yeah.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.678
So how will you treat him?

22:15.702 --> 22:17.742
We'll give him what he wants,
we'll give him a cell.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.675
And if he wants to
talk, we'll listen.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.555
And that's it?

22:26.579 --> 22:27.579
Yeah.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.592
Come on.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.510
Mama was struggling.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.957
She held onto him, kept
saying please don't,

23:01.981 --> 23:04.717
please don't please,
please don't.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.091
I was just a little
boy of seven.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.627
I saw it all.

23:17.930 --> 23:18.930
I,

23:21.868 --> 23:24.604
I can't get rid of
the smell of...

23:31.143 --> 23:35.791
Sydney, I'll try and
help you let go of this.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.417
I can't promise it will be easy.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.053
Thank you.

23:44.123 --> 23:52.123
♪♪♪

23:52.632 --> 23:54.109
You remember Jim?

23:54.133 --> 23:58.146
Jim, of course, good
to see you again.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.515
Something I said?

23:59.539 --> 24:01.584
Jim's a wee bit down,

24:01.608 --> 24:05.512
so he's gonna come back and
spend some time with us again.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.695
And Aristotle, you know,
for whom I have great time

24:12.719 --> 24:15.598
by the way, he maintains
that the brain

24:15.622 --> 24:17.724
is mostly composed of water,

24:19.025 --> 24:21.504
and if the moon can
affect the tides,

24:21.528 --> 24:24.631
what, what can it do
to the human brain?

24:26.666 --> 24:27.967
Won't be long now.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.681
Won't be long for what?

24:32.705 --> 24:34.049
The moon.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.684
The moon.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.986
The moon, stupid bitch.

24:38.010 --> 24:41.289
Hey, didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.091
Don't you talk about my mum.

24:43.115 --> 24:46.061
There's a sculpture in Ireland
that's 5,000 years old

24:46.085 --> 24:49.598
that's a depiction of the moon.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.634
Yeah, me mother was Irish.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.102
A lot of people say there
are more suicides,

24:54.126 --> 24:57.239
murders, and admissions
to mental hospitals

24:57.263 --> 24:58.831
during a full moon.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.119
Hey, hey!

25:27.860 --> 25:29.672
Get out! Get out!

25:29.696 --> 25:30.939
I'll fucking kill you.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.307
That's enough, let's go home.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.667
It's alright, it's all good.

25:45.878 --> 25:46.878
John?

25:49.682 --> 25:50.883
John, it's Paul.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.930
I'm extremely concerned.

25:54.954 --> 25:55.954
As are we.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.692
Then use chlorpromazine,

26:02.629 --> 26:03.930
or a feeding tube.

26:06.633 --> 26:07.633
Give him ECT.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.015
At Kingsley Hall we take
the Hippocratic Oath

26:13.039 --> 26:17.385
very seriously, and the
promise not to do harm.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.688
If I was to tie John down

26:19.712 --> 26:22.749
and administer
electricity to his brain

26:24.050 --> 26:27.663
or fill him so full of
drugs he couldn't speak,

26:27.687 --> 26:31.590
would I be doing him good or
would I be doing him harm?

26:34.661 --> 26:35.661
John?

26:38.297 --> 26:39.297
John?

26:42.168 --> 26:45.681
What do you suggest
I tell his parents?

26:45.705 --> 26:47.640
They're not my concern.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.175
John?

27:16.235 --> 27:19.772
So hard to get away
from the noise, Frank.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.789
You'd imagine at this time
of day they'd be quiet.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.156
That's all you want really,

27:28.180 --> 27:30.316
is a bit of peace and quiet.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.350
Hey?

27:39.826 --> 27:42.128
How have you been today, Frank?

27:43.229 --> 27:45.197
A little bit down are you?

27:57.877 --> 27:58.877
Yeah.

28:06.753 --> 28:09.155
Do you know what I think, Frank?

28:10.923 --> 28:12.024
Will we have a,

28:13.292 --> 28:15.995
will we have a
little bedtime poem?

28:17.129 --> 28:19.165
Yeah, why don't we do that.

28:22.769 --> 28:26.982
Let's take up from where
we left last night.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.006
Ah yeah.

28:32.211 --> 28:36.783
But if my heart must
break for your sake

28:38.517 --> 28:40.987
it will break in music I know.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.056
Poets' hearts break so,

28:46.492 --> 28:51.073
but strange I was not told
that the brain could hold

28:51.097 --> 28:53.065
in a tiny ivory cell,

28:55.301 --> 28:57.303
God's heaven and hell.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.210
So true that, isn't it, Frank?

29:10.817 --> 29:12.084
You're so soft.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.055
Oh, that makes me calm.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.014
John?

29:45.451 --> 29:50.156
John, I think it's time you
and I had a little chat.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.119
What the fuck is all this about?

30:24.924 --> 30:25.924
John?

30:33.966 --> 30:36.102
You know you can talk to us.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.574
John, when you're ready,

30:45.211 --> 30:46.979
just come and find us.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.179
- Raymond!
- You must see Maria.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.280
You must see Maria.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.082
- Shit!
- You must, you must!

31:14.106 --> 31:16.584
Raymond this had better
be fucking important.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.644
I'll be waiting.

31:22.114 --> 31:25.027
Alright, alright, give
me that, give me that.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.119
Take that. Alright, here.

31:45.504 --> 31:50.609
Would you like me to get in
touch with Isaac's father?

31:52.444 --> 31:55.081
No. He didn't want Isaac.

31:56.615 --> 32:00.028
He was only interested
when I started going mad.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.264
Then he took him away.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.133
But he was right, I can't
look after a child.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.468
None of this is your fault.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.492
I can't.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.231
Some tribes believe
that there is a,

32:14.300 --> 32:16.635
a spirit in the placenta,

32:18.237 --> 32:20.315
the amniotic fluid,

32:20.339 --> 32:23.175
and that if that
spirit gets unhappy

32:24.643 --> 32:25.853
for whatever reason,

32:25.877 --> 32:31.150
then that causes the mother to
experience frequent crying,

32:33.685 --> 32:37.123
and loss of appetite,
difficulty sleepin',

32:38.424 --> 32:41.203
and that is exactly
what we would call

32:41.227 --> 32:43.005
postnatal depression.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.730
How did they cure her?

32:46.398 --> 32:49.777
Well they would summon a Shaman

32:49.801 --> 32:53.439
to perform a seance to
make the spirit leave.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.051
Do it.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.253
Do it. Do it, please, do it.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.354
Do it.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.288
- Do it.
- No, I'm not, I'm not,

33:00.312 --> 33:02.590
I'm not a shaman, Maria.
- Yes, yes you are.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.627
Do it, do it please, do it.

33:05.651 --> 33:09.397
Please do it.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.433
We must hold hands.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.159
You do it, you do it.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.661
Yes, yes.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.433
Please, please, please!

33:23.535 --> 33:25.313
Can I say something, Angie?

33:25.337 --> 33:26.548
Uh huh.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.440
If you, please
don't be offended.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.411
I really like you.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.749
Yeah, you've got a beautiful
quality about you.

33:38.694 --> 33:39.694
Oh wow.

33:39.718 --> 33:43.731
And you're very,
very compassionate.

33:43.755 --> 33:47.402
Lovely compassionate
quality, like Ronnie has.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.337
He has that same quality.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.773
I can see why you two, you know,

33:51.797 --> 33:54.209
gravitated towards each other.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.233
Maybe.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.080
You've got a lovely smile.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.514
Pffft.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.584
Yeah, it comes from somewhere
deep, you can tell.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.219
Now you're fibbing.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.789
Yeah, it's the truth,
it's the truth.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.514
I like you too Jim.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.585
Well, thank you.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.458
So I'll get back to me...

34:22.360 --> 34:24.438
Thanks for talking to me Angie.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.773
Thank you.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.266
Angela, Angelis.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.813
Boing, boing.

34:31.837 --> 34:35.774
Do you remember that when
you were kid, the angelus?

34:39.445 --> 34:43.658
Don't you find that time is
completely different in here?

34:43.681 --> 34:46.485
Like outside it's
like, whurrrrrrr.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.621
In here it's calm, calm.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.538
Except sometimes when
I hear these voices

34:56.562 --> 35:00.142
and they start telling me
to do things, you know,

35:00.166 --> 35:02.244
like, they start in a whisper

35:02.268 --> 35:04.412
and then they get louder
and louder and then,

35:04.436 --> 35:05.813
like my head is going to explode

35:05.837 --> 35:07.815
and I say fuck it, fuck
it, fuck it, alright!

35:07.839 --> 35:08.839
I'll do it!

35:13.612 --> 35:15.323
What do they tell
you to do, Jim?

35:15.347 --> 35:18.550
Oh, you don't want to know
what they tell me to do.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.298
Sometimes they have a bit
of a laugh with you,

35:23.322 --> 35:26.534
sometimes they say
like obscene things.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.436
Other times they're
telling you to do things

35:28.460 --> 35:31.206
that you just know,
you're just like fuck no,

35:31.230 --> 35:32.798
don't want to do that.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.711
And they're always
laughing afterwards.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.714
Yeah, you see we made
you fucking do it.

35:39.738 --> 35:40.772
Hmmm.

35:41.973 --> 35:45.353
Anyway, today is a good
day, it's a good day.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.721
No voices today?

35:46.745 --> 35:49.457
No voices today, no
writing on the walls.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.481
Well,

35:51.650 --> 35:54.729
no.

35:54.753 --> 35:58.190
Anyway, thanks for
listening to me Angie.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.228
Erm, if,

36:07.499 --> 36:10.936
if Ronnie went away, I
don't know what I'd do.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.540
I know.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.810
Because, like,

36:20.812 --> 36:24.226
sometimes you know
this thing in my head

36:24.250 --> 36:27.595
tells me that if
you take him away,

36:27.619 --> 36:29.464
I don't mean you to
take this personally

36:29.488 --> 36:31.499
but that if you take him away,

36:31.523 --> 36:33.868
then they're kinda telling me

36:33.892 --> 36:36.538
that I'd have to take you away.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.963
Loonies, loonies!

36:39.465 --> 36:40.732
Loonies, loonies!

36:43.269 --> 36:44.736
Loonies.

36:58.784 --> 37:02.654
I'm 73, I've never
ever taken drugs,

37:04.790 --> 37:07.802
and, well, I've heard
LSD sends you mad.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.671
You're among friends.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.463
What have you to lose?

37:12.731 --> 37:15.610
But, I don't want to go mad.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.445
LSD is controversial,

37:17.469 --> 37:20.715
but it can have a
profoundly valuable

37:20.739 --> 37:22.984
and therapeutic effect

37:23.008 --> 37:26.421
if you take it in a
controlled environment.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.456
It might help you deal
with your memories.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.658
It might just unblock them.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.995
People who've revisited
memories like you,

37:34.019 --> 37:37.856
sometimes it just, they
can find an inner peace,

37:38.957 --> 37:40.792
they can face up to it.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.807
What do you think,
do you trust me?

37:45.831 --> 37:48.443
I do trust you, yes.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.478
Want to try it?

37:50.502 --> 37:51.502
No,

Okay.

Tell Dad what happened.

43:30.341 --> 43:32.353
Tell me what?

43:32.377 --> 43:35.322
Granny showed us a
little doll she made.

43:35.346 --> 43:39.694
It's got real hair and
is dressed like you.

43:39.718 --> 43:43.698
She's called it Ronald

give you a heart attack.

Suzie tells me that you, um,

44:26.932 --> 44:28.366
you made a wee doll.

44:55.226 --> 44:57.872
I don't quite know how to do it.

44:57.896 --> 44:59.140

44:59.164 --> 45:00.324
But that's alright, you know.

45:00.348 --> 45:01.743
- It's this way.
- Yeah.

45:01.767 --> 45:04.111
You see, you know what,
you know I think?

45:04.135 --> 45:05.412
- Yeah.
- Anxiety.

45:05.436 --> 45:06.881
That's not good.

45:06.905 --> 45:08.816
Nah, anxiety is no good for you.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.151
I know, well thank you.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.286
No, no, I know what
that feels like.

45:12.310 --> 45:14.355
Yeah, yeah I'm
feeling anxious now,

45:14.379 --> 45:16.057

45:16.081 --> 45:18.893
how to tell him that
this doesn't work.

45:18.917 --> 45:20.494

45:20.518 --> 45:22.029
What would you?

45:22.053 --> 45:23.898
- Well, you did your best.
- I tried.

45:23.922 --> 45:25.867

45:25.891 --> 45:27.468

today doing this.

45:27.492 --> 45:28.903
Three hours.

45:28.927 --> 45:30.271
No, none of these
things fit that.

45:30.295 --> 45:32.006
I don't understand them.

45:32.030 --> 45:34.341
I used to, but my
memory's gone a bit.

45:34.365 --> 45:37.511
I thought you could help,
I thought you would help,

45:37.535 --> 45:38.913
but never mind.

45:38.937 --> 45:40.882
The only thing I know how to do

45:40.906 --> 45:43.184
is read the front
of it, you know.

45:43.208 --> 45:45.386
When you think about
it, really, you know,

45:45.410 --> 45:47.454
when we've got
watches and clocks,

45:47.478 --> 45:48.990
do you know what the
first clock was?

45:49.014 --> 45:49.957
- No.

45:49.981 --> 45:51.158
The Moon,

45:51.182 --> 45:52.193
was the first clock.

45:52.217 --> 45:53.895
Is that a clock?

45:53.919 --> 45:54.796
Yeah, well that's how
With the dial on it?

45:54.820 --> 45:55.562
Yeah, that's right.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.998
Well, no.

45:57.022 --> 45:58.342
People used to look
up at the moon

45:58.366 --> 46:01.335
and they'd say, oh
it's night, it's day.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.570
That was the first
kind of clock.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.440
And then we developed
these things.

46:06.464 --> 46:09.343
So it never had an
instrument going round

46:09.367 --> 46:10.477
on the moon?

46:10.501 --> 46:11.946
- No, no.
- It was all in the...

46:11.970 --> 46:13.038
No.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.746
What's wrong with
you, old sport?

46:25.616 --> 46:27.953
You don't have to be afraid.

46:32.991 --> 46:34.501

Yeah, let's give him some space.

Kingsley Hall is not a

It's a small household of people

49:37.608 --> 49:39.486

49:39.510 --> 49:41.488
who are trying to live together

49:41.512 --> 49:44.025

power relations.

49:44.049 --> 49:46.693
So no distinction between
doctors and patients?

49:46.717 --> 49:48.477
Well there are doctors
and there are patients

49:48.501 --> 49:51.604
but we're all living
together as people.

49:52.823 --> 49:55.560
Sometimes doctors
need to be helped,

49:57.362 --> 50:01.266
and sometimes those that we call
patients can offer comfort.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.203
And how successful are you?

50:06.337 --> 50:08.339
Well there's been no murders.

50:11.476 --> 50:14.255
You sell thousands of books
on student campuses.

50:14.279 --> 50:16.523
They call you the Acid Marxist.

50:16.547 --> 50:18.259
Well I don't.

Castinada and Marx.

that treats people in
the absence of symptoms

50:53.418 --> 50:56.130
and signs of illness.

50:56.154 --> 51:00.134
It's the only branch of
medicine that treats people

51:00.158 --> 51:03.504
against their will
and imprisons them,

51:03.528 --> 51:06.573
and the madness of our patients

51:06.597 --> 51:11.569
is a result of the destruction
wreaked upon them by us,

51:14.372 --> 51:16.383
by them and themselves.

51:16.407 --> 51:19.510
But madness need not
be a breakdown.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.514
It could be a breakthrough.

51:26.451 --> 51:29.396
Can be potentially liberating.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.390
But people need tranquilizers.

51:34.625 --> 51:37.595
Tranquilizers prevent
communication.

51:40.698 --> 51:44.311
How can you have a
dialogue with the mad man

51:44.335 --> 51:46.337
if he's dead in the brain?

51:53.211 --> 51:56.547
Sarah really hasn't
spoken for 18 months.

51:57.782 --> 52:00.794
We tried to engage with her.

52:00.818 --> 52:03.230
She doesn't eat so
we force feed her

52:03.254 --> 52:04.765
and of course she's violent.

52:04.789 --> 52:06.557
That's why she's here.

52:08.726 --> 52:10.495
I'd like to see her.

52:13.898 --> 52:14.898
Of course.

52:16.734 --> 52:20.471
It would be interesting
to hear your assessment.

52:34.352 --> 52:35.352
Hello.

52:37.522 --> 52:39.324
Mind if I sit with you?

52:48.399 --> 52:50.301
Do you mind if I, can I?

52:57.675 --> 52:58.876
A little cooler.

53:12.423 --> 53:13.491
I'm Dr. Laing.

53:14.592 --> 53:16.394
You can call me Ronnie.

53:38.583 --> 53:39.750
Do you want one?

53:56.401 --> 53:59.770
I'll just leave one
there, if you, if you...

54:01.539 --> 54:02.907
Sorry, do you mind?

54:59.764 --> 55:02.433
It's quite comforting, isn't it?

55:09.907 --> 55:10.907
Yeah.

55:12.743 --> 55:14.679
Kind of like that rhythm.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.462
Shall we have a wee chat?

55:39.737 --> 55:42.373
It's difficult in
here, isn't it?

55:43.508 --> 55:45.510
Does it give you a headache?

55:52.917 --> 55:55.653
I, a chap I know in London is a,

55:58.789 --> 56:01.759
he's a Indian
Acupuncturist, you know.

56:03.561 --> 56:06.831
And all these points, we have
all these points everywhere.

56:08.566 --> 56:12.078
There's just, there's
two in there,

56:12.102 --> 56:14.472
if you can get them, it just,

56:16.006 --> 56:17.006
it just..

56:18.443 --> 56:21.622
This would give me a
headache in here.

56:21.646 --> 56:22.847
Might just help.

56:24.114 --> 56:26.584
Do you want, do you mind if I?

56:31.956 --> 56:32.956
Do you mind?

56:34.892 --> 56:36.393
Just here.

56:38.062 --> 56:39.062
Just there.

56:44.835 --> 56:47.648
This can be quite
nice, you can just,

56:47.672 --> 56:50.717
just clears your head
a wee bit maybe.

56:50.741 --> 56:51.809
Just like that.

56:58.883 --> 56:59.984
Just like that.

57:04.522 --> 57:06.090
Do you mind if I just?

57:07.658 --> 57:09.660
If I can just get right, no?

57:18.703 --> 57:20.847
I find it just does,
all these points,

57:20.871 --> 57:23.249
there's a lot in your feet.

57:23.273 --> 57:25.610
Do you mind if I, if I just,

57:28.679 --> 57:29.747
just take your,

57:34.184 --> 57:35.184
and just...

57:38.923 --> 57:41.201
He tells me there's
a point in the foot

57:41.225 --> 57:44.662
that is related to every
other bit of you.

57:46.764 --> 57:49.934
Everywhere, if you
just find the right...

57:53.003 --> 57:55.005
I mean, I'm not an expert.

57:59.209 --> 58:01.879
But it used to be
quite relaxing.

58:03.147 --> 58:05.816
I mean, you're stuck
in here all day.

58:22.032 --> 58:24.569
How long have you been in here?

58:26.771 --> 58:27.771
A long time?

58:31.576 --> 58:32.643
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:36.213 --> 58:37.247
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:40.885 --> 58:42.052
Are you hungry?

58:48.325 --> 58:50.637
I'm quite hungry.

58:50.661 --> 58:53.163
Should we send out
for some pizza?

59:00.104 --> 59:03.216
Hello, could you
get us some pizza?

59:03.240 --> 59:04.685
Not too much cheese on mine,

59:04.709 --> 59:05.989
I don't want to risk a migraine.

59:06.013 --> 59:08.855
Sarah will, erm,
what do you want?

59:08.879 --> 59:09.879
Mushroom?

59:10.881 --> 59:11.881
Pepperoni?

59:12.883 --> 59:13.883
Pepperoni.

59:15.152 --> 59:17.922
Sarah will have
pepperoni, thank you.

59:32.637 --> 59:33.637
Thank you.

59:52.957 --> 59:53.957
Okay.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:00.964
Thank you.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:09.082
What you did was
most unconventional

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.184
and highly unprofessional.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:13.654
Professor, it's your job

01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:15.198
to understand what
she's trying to say.

01:00:15.222 --> 01:00:17.423
It's not her job to
try and understand

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.026
why you're filling her
full of tranquilizing shit

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.427
and locking her away.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.697
Without this tranquilizing shit,

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:25.365
as you call it, most
of our patients

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:29.135
would get no peace whatsoever
from their illness.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:30.436
Is that right?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.006
See, I just wonder who's
gettin' more peace.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.374
Is it them or you?

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:37.678
- Sarah's condition...
- I'm not fucking finished.

01:00:37.702 --> 01:00:39.036
I think you are.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.793
Here you are mate,
keep the change.

01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:55.786
Oh cheers, gov, very kind.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.039
Did you miss me?

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:07.063
What is it?

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.405
Paul?

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:20.978
It's just too much.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.994
You do look awfully tired.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.098
Why don't you just, just lie
down and have a wee nap.

01:01:30.122 --> 01:01:31.122
Go on.

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.064
Yes.

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:45.302
That's good, huh.

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:50.350
And the demon waited at
the mouth of the cave

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.019
for the baby to be born

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.979
so that he could eat it.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:59.025
You need some fucking help.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.260
Mhmm.

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:02.352
It'll eat your baby in all.

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:05.956
I don't have a baby.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:17.734
What you lookin' at?

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:21.537
Hm.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:34.010
Paul.

01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:37.881
Paul.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:40.817
Paul.

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:58.178
I, erm, I don't think I can
stay here much longer.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:03:59.322
Before I help you with that,

01:03:59.346 --> 01:04:01.047
if I can help you with that,

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:03.616
erm, you have to help me.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.577
As far as I can see, in the
night you broke that vase.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.059
But, I've been asleep.

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:16.629
You must have got
up for a piss then.

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:19.299
Angie loves that vase, she's
going to be really upset.

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:21.491
I don't...

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.896
I know how you like Angie.

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:29.175
What're we gonna do?

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.544
Well it looks completely fucked.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.646
Aye, it is Paul.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.040
We can, erm, try and fix it?

01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:38.875
Try and fix it, aye.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.645
Yeah.

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.500
Yeah.

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:56.102
If I put enough glue on it,.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.894
Yeah, it'll be fine.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.374
Everyone wants a piece of you.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.667
Don't you get tired of it all?

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.552
- In there.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.256
Right here?

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.703
Oh god, it's everywhere.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:32.438
Ohhh.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.707
And what do we think of that?

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.101
That is beautiful.

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:41.614
That is just the ticket.

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:43.984
Very, very lovely.

01:05:44.008 --> 01:05:46.643
And Humpty's back
together again.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:53.026
Do you think people
might notice?

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.651
I'll dim the lights.

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:57.730
I feel a little better.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.990
- Yeah.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.291
Thank you.

01:06:08.232 --> 01:06:10.276
Everyone!

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.046
Would anybody like
to sing a song?

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.348
No? You.

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:16.249
You look like you
can sing, come on.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:17.283
One song.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.518
Okay, I'll do it.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.310
Aww, Angie.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:24.524
Do you know, After You've Gone?

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:27.151
- Yes please, thank you.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:33.623
Do you know this one

I didn't know you could sing.

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:03.589
- No, I can't!
- You kept that a secret.

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:07.851
It's a big secret.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:23.899
I hate sharing you.

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:28.381
I want you all to myself.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.649
You want to own me?

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:30.673
No.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:35.421
But I do want more of you.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.224
You can have as
much as you like,

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.283
as much as I can give you.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.429
Can we talk?

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.122
Is that not what we're doin'?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.404
If I were to have a baby.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:52.662
- No.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.265
But, if I were?

01:08:58.268 --> 01:08:59.636
Oh Christ, Angie.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.648
I already got five children,

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.684
and don't see much of them.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:07.620
Well that's your choice.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:11.457
It was the mother that
I left, not them.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.817
But if I were to have a baby,

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:16.385
our baby.

01:09:18.221 --> 01:09:20.624
I can't stop you having a baby.

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:25.205
But would you, would you
like me to have a baby?

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:27.372
Would you like me to
like you having a baby?

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.442
See it's okay for you.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:32.712
You have a family and
your, and your work

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:35.515
and the famous Dr. Laing.

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:36.982
What do I have?

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:40.520
A half finished PHD and
a tiny bit of you.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:43.356
If you want a baby, have a baby.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.725
What's wrong with you?

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:48.361
You wouldn't have spoken to
me like this six months ago.

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:50.363
Well you didn't want a
baby six months ago.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:53.290
Well I haven't said
I want one now.

01:09:56.393 --> 01:09:57.393
Okay.

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:01.331
Okay, let's have a baby.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.601
Yeah?

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.550
Hello, Baby.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:14.520
We have to find a way of
engaging in a truthful dialogue

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:18.924
in a language without
knots and entanglements

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:22.595
and the wee, the wee
barbs of hatred

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:25.322
and spite and revenge
and jealousy

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:28.592
and malice and envy that,

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:35.375
that creep into our mouths
and hide in our words.

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:37.367
Ronnie's working on
threesomes right now.

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.614
Yes well, we know how hard it is

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:43.283
to keep a marriage
alive, don't we?

01:10:43.307 --> 01:10:44.917
How true that is.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:48.721
Are you speaking from
personal experience?

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.380
Unfortunately yes.

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:53.025
Life.

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:55.552
Is a sexually
transmitted disease,

01:10:57.654 --> 01:11:01.033
and the mortality rate
is 100 fucking percent.

01:11:01.057 --> 01:11:03.703
Listen I'm serious.

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:07.631
Bedrooms are the most dangerous
places on the earth.

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:14.904
What will you call him?

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:18.718
I don't know.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.520
I was thinking,

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:23.456
I was thinking maybe Shadow.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.548
Shad.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.460
Why?

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:29.662
Because that's where
he'll spend his life,

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:30.887
in Ronnie's shadow.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.472
If he doesn't burn
to cinders first.

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:42.542
Don't. Don't.

01:11:42.566 --> 01:11:45.969
You are not, you are not
crazy, like the rest of us.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.873
But sometimes I wish I was.

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:53.008
No.

01:11:54.378 --> 01:11:55.445
But I'm not.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.717
I'm nothing special.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:04.354
I'm just ordinary.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.627
Ronnie, he's like this,

01:12:12.596 --> 01:12:14.864
this hot bright sun, isn't he?

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:20.913
He could have any
woman he wants.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:21.937
He picked me,

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:29.889
and when he focuses
his attention on you,

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:32.649
you can just, you
can just burn up.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.022
He makes me feel extraordinary.

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:45.829
Well, he used to.

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:53.713
The only thing he loves
as much as his patients

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:54.971
are his children.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:01.077
I thought we could be a family.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.114
Maria,

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:12.197
what if I've made a
terrible mistake?

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.389
No.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:15.858
Don't be sad.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.730
- Okay.

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:27.980
I'm hungry.

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:29.706
What's for breakfast?

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:35.411
This is a nice surprise.

01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:44.566
John, this might sound
like a dumb question

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:46.165
but are you actually
going to eat that?

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.266
- Yeah.
- Okay, well

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.735
it's been quite a while
since you've had any food

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.605
and that might be a
little bit aggressive.

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:55.064
Let me get you something else.

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:07.577
Nice to have you with us.

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:10.446
Porridge.

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:14.450
In Scotland, we use
salt not sugar.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:22.625
How are you?

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.660
Okay.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:31.711
Are you able to tell us
what's been going on?

01:14:31.735 --> 01:14:34.113
I don't think you'd understand.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.816
Maybe I will.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.052
Anyway, it doesn't
matter now, it's over.

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:42.655
What's over?

01:14:42.679 --> 01:14:44.280
The mission.

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:50.520
I had to count to a
million, one by one,

01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:55.525
then back to zero
without stopping.

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:00.263
Why?

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:04.677
It's the only way to
silence the voice.

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:06.145
Whose voices?

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:07.771
One of my voices.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:11.684
The one that frightened me.

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:15.988
John, have you been
counting this entire time?

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.013
Five years.

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:20.016
Oh for fuck's sake.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.328
Electric shock stopped me.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.999
It really hurt my head and
I forgot where I was.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.268
Sometimes the voices made me

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:32.729
deliberately lose track
of where I got to.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.341
Why didn't you talk to us?

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.735
The voice wouldn't let me.

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:46.810
It's okay, it's okay.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:53.893
Can I see my parents?

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:55.517
Of course you can,
yeah, we'll call them.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.774
What was it you wanted, Jim?

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:21.978
And she was delivered
of a manchild,

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:27.050
and when he came
forth from her womb,

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:35.358
the dragon was waiting at the
mouth of the cave to eat him.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:41.765
You're misquoting
Revelations again now Jim.

01:16:43.867 --> 01:16:48.738
I'm so worried about
the birth of this,

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:51.307
of this child, Ronnie.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:54.978
I'm tormented by it.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:02.361
Jim, the child is not yet born.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:05.955
Yeah, but when it is
born, it won't be me.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:10.069
- Go away!
- Alright, just.

01:17:10.093 --> 01:17:11.036
- Get out!
- Alright, right, just,

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.662
alright, just, good.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:15.390
Here we go, here
we go, here we go.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:22.047
Angie, how are you
feeling right now?

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:23.415
Are you doing okay?

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:25.718
- For fuck's sake!
- Alright, alright, alright.

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:26.886
Give her some space.

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:28.754
It's coming.

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:30.122
The head's coming.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:31.906
- Visualize, Angie!
- Here we go, here we go.

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:39.298
- Visualize, Angie.
- This is my first time, yes.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:40.957
It's coming.

01:17:42.726 --> 01:17:43.769
It's a boy.

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:45.762
- It's a boy.

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.833
Shhh.

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:57.249
Dr. Laing, Dr. Laing, could
you say something for us?

01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:59.384
Could you say something for us?

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.408
Not now.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:06.125
It's okay. It's okay.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.126
It's okay.

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:08.151
Shhh.

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:21.006
Okay, how do you
guys feel right now,

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.242
can you just, talk
to the camera?

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:24.944
Anything you want to say?

01:18:24.968 --> 01:18:26.402
- Not now.
- Not now.

01:18:28.772 --> 01:18:31.450
Okay, let's just,
just keep on them.

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:32.909
Hello, Gabriel.

01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:35.020
Hello.

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.044
Hello!

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.825
I think we got this.

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:41.689
Should we keep rolling,
you wanna keep rolling?

01:18:41.713 --> 01:18:42.261
Are we good?

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:44.420
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

01:18:45.789 --> 01:18:47.232
He's perfect.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:49.258
- He is perfect.

01:18:51.795 --> 01:18:54.139
Guys, sorry, have you
got a name for the boy?

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:55.440
Fuck off.

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.342
Alright, keep rolling.

01:18:57.366 --> 01:18:59.769
Hello little baby.

01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:03.548
Raymond, could you, could you
just look at the camera?

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.374
Could we have a quiet
word with you?

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:08.788
Can we get any close ups?

01:19:08.812 --> 01:19:10.313
Can we get close ups?

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.363
Come on Barabus, open up.

01:19:29.933 --> 01:19:30.933
Open up.

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:36.138
There.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:39.876
There you go.

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:42.477
Now.

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:51.154
Can't believe it,
forgot the hammer.

01:19:57.093 --> 01:20:00.529
Did you know he stole
and ate the placenta?

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:06.378
Yeah, anything goes, but
we have a duty to protect.

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:08.347
Well who protects Jim?

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.439
He came here for sanctuary.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.243
Ronnie, he might kill someone.

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:18.514
Do you really wanna
take that risk?

01:20:22.118 --> 01:20:24.864
Why didn't you
tell me about Jim?

01:20:24.888 --> 01:20:26.808
Well I didn't care when
he threatened to hurt me,

01:20:26.832 --> 01:20:29.201
but he's talking
about stealing Gabe.

01:20:29.225 --> 01:20:30.602
I had to tell someone.

01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:31.904
Why didn't you tell me?

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:33.496
I'm telling you now.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:36.441
So what are you
gonna do about it?

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:38.234
I'm dealing with it.

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.071
I failed him.

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:44.941
You failed him?

01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:48.420
Ronnie, he's
threatened to kill me.

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:50.022
You know I'd never
let that happen.

01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:52.024
There's someone with
him, all the time,

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:53.926
round the clock.

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:56.095
He's still here?

01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:58.430
I can't just throw him out.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:00.933
If I did that every time
someone had a problem

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:02.134
there'd be nobody here.

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:04.003
I will live anywhere you want,

01:21:04.027 --> 01:21:05.507
you know that, but
you have to tell me

01:21:05.531 --> 01:21:07.934
that we are going to be safe.

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:11.400
The call men, Angie.

01:21:12.668 --> 01:21:14.413
Save one soul save the world.

01:21:14.437 --> 01:21:16.648
Well let that one
soul be our baby.

01:21:16.672 --> 01:21:18.672
He didn't choose to live
in this fucking mad house.

01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:23.155
But do we actually know how.

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:24.459
Electro convulsive
Therapy works?

01:21:24.483 --> 01:21:25.483
No.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.962
Of course we don't know
precisely how ECT works,

01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:31.530
we never claimed we do.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.632
We simply know it does work.

01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:37.469
What he fails to mention is
that after receiving ECT

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:39.963
some people lose their memory,

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:43.608
not to mention
their personality.

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:47.212
Dr. Laing must agree
that this procedure

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:50.715
is the most effective treatment
for severe depression.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.684
No, I don't agree with
anything you say.

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:54.719
After less than five
minutes from first

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.956
laying eyes on a stranger,

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.993
and without this stranger
even having moved

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:04.620
or uttered a word, he can
have them taken away,

01:22:06.155 --> 01:22:09.668
drugged, electrocuted, or have
bits of their brain removed.

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:11.812
That's not entirely true. You
know, the Nazis executed

01:22:11.836 --> 01:22:14.339
50,000 psychiatric patients

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:16.175
to prevent them from breeding.

01:22:16.199 --> 01:22:17.199
That's hardly relevant.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:20.345
Well it was fucking
relevant to them.

01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:22.447
Dr. Laing, language please.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.116
Dr. Meredith, I can
only apologize.

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.109
I've heard far worse.

01:23:08.551 --> 01:23:09.985
- Hello.
- Dr. Laing.

01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:12.587
How is she?

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:17.726
The test results have confirmed
her initial diagnosis.

01:23:20.263 --> 01:23:21.263
I'm sorry.

01:23:22.465 --> 01:23:25.601
What we can offer now
is palliative care.

01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:30.105
How long?

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.453
It's impossible to say.
Every case is different.

01:23:34.477 --> 01:23:36.117
Oh come on, spare me.
What are we talking?

01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:39.324
Days, weeks, months, years?

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.549
Weeks.

01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:44.629
She knows she's very ill
so there's no point

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:47.556
in telling her anymore than
is absolutely necessary.

01:23:49.425 --> 01:23:51.305
Well don't you think she's
got the right to know

01:23:51.329 --> 01:23:55.740
that she's not gonna
wake up one day soon?

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.842
Her mother doesn't
want her told.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:58.866
Right.

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:05.117
Alright, thanks.

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:06.618
Hello!

01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:07.642
Hi, Dad.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:12.757
How you feeling?

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.049
Tired.

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:18.621
Dad, I want the truth.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:26.738
We've always known that
there was no cure.

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:28.564
So I'm going to die?

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.877
Yeah.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:33.901
When?

01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:38.117
Soon.

01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:39.551
Dad, I'm scared.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.177
Shhhh, it's okay.

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:44.123
Shhh.

01:24:44.147 --> 01:24:45.424
Can I ask you something?

01:24:45.448 --> 01:24:46.448
Anything.

01:24:48.484 --> 01:24:51.387
Do you believe in
life after death?

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:54.133
Whoa.

01:24:54.157 --> 01:24:56.501
That's a big question, that is.

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:58.361
That's a belief in God.

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:01.606
I was going to ask that too.

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:02.630
Ahh.

01:25:05.734 --> 01:25:07.479
Wow.

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:09.714
Well we could sit here all day

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:12.184
debating questions like that.

01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:13.409
I've got time.

01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:19.481
Well,

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:23.452
the Buddha was asked

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:30.259
about the creation of
the world and he said

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.806
that he only ever tried
to answer questions

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:36.808
that could potentially
be answered.

01:25:36.832 --> 01:25:40.203
Go about.

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:48.453
For what it's worth, yeah, I
think there's more to life

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:51.390
than being trapped in a body.

01:25:51.414 --> 01:25:54.783
It's alright.

01:25:55.918 --> 01:25:56.918
Shhh.

01:26:02.258 --> 01:26:05.894
I helped you into this world,
I'll help you leave it.

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:14.736
It's okay.

01:26:16.405 --> 01:26:17.405
I'm here.

I'm singing him a wee song

01:26:53.476 --> 01:26:57.689
so he knows about his mother's
sweet and gentle love.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:26:58.923
You've just come back,

Talk to me, please.

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:24.907
About what?

01:27:27.343 --> 01:27:29.378
Anything, just,

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:32.781
just talk to me.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.856
You have time for
everybody but us.

01:27:43.392 --> 01:27:46.305
We live here in this

01:27:46.329 --> 01:27:48.707

Give the fucking
martyrdom a rest.

01:27:54.637 --> 01:27:58.341
I deal in human fucking
misery every day.

01:28:00.843 --> 01:28:04.547
Up to my neck in
people's emotional shit.

01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:11.920
Who takes care of me?

01:28:22.931 --> 01:28:24.376
I'm supposed to heal.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.703
I can't do that if I
can't even help myself.

You have to stop drinking, okay?

01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:34.977
Okay?

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:38.923
Timothy Leary said
that he would,

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:44.520
ah, he would distribute 300,000
trips of acid for free.

01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:49.000
He was telling me, he says,

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:51.903
"Ronnie, Britain's your patch."

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:54.539
He wanted me to do it!

01:28:54.563 --> 01:28:55.798
I said, fuck you.

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.860
Imagine getting fucked by
somebody else's fantasy.

01:29:15.984 --> 01:29:18.530
Alright.

01:29:18.554 --> 01:29:20.689
Let's see who's the stronger!

01:29:25.494 --> 01:29:26.529
Come on, Ronnie.

01:29:33.602 --> 01:29:34.602
That's it.

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:43.679
Take him out.

01:29:47.683 --> 01:29:49.961
Come on, come on, get off!

01:29:49.985 --> 01:29:51.545
I suppose I just feel
taken for granted.

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:55.991
Everyone else's
problems seem so,

01:29:57.092 --> 01:29:58.694
so fucking important.

01:30:00.563 --> 01:30:03.107
There never seems to
be any time for mine.

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:06.635
I will always find
time to listen to you.

01:30:09.004 --> 01:30:11.049
Am I interrupting?

01:30:11.073 --> 01:30:14.052
No we were, we I was
talking to her.

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:16.020
Please, Ronnie.

01:30:16.044 --> 01:30:17.756
What's your game?

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.724
What game would that be?

01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:20.849
You're drunk.

01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:24.529
And you're a fucking slut,

01:30:24.553 --> 01:30:26.898
but in the morning
I'll be sober.

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:28.090
I doubt that.

01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:32.060
Ooh!

01:31:03.692 --> 01:31:04.927
You disgust me.

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:10.132
You fucking disgust me!

01:31:13.569 --> 01:31:15.780
And your fucking disgusts me.

01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:17.849
Paul is our friend.

01:31:17.873 --> 01:31:20.142
He was trying to be nice to me.

01:31:21.844 --> 01:31:23.855
I can't do this anymore.

01:31:23.879 --> 01:31:25.159
What has happened
to you, Ronnie?

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:29.918
I don't even recognize
you anymore.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.160
Do you have any respect for me?

01:31:35.057 --> 01:31:37.235
You think I'm sleeping
with everyone?

01:31:37.259 --> 01:31:39.103
No, no, no.

01:31:39.127 --> 01:31:40.539
Just the odd one or two.

01:31:40.563 --> 01:31:41.563
I'm not!

01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:45.186
You're becoming as
deluded and paranoid

01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:46.978
as the rest of them.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.805
What the fuck do you know
about delusion and paranoia?

01:31:51.674 --> 01:31:53.918
You live a charmed life.

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:55.854
All I've got is misery.

01:31:55.878 --> 01:31:58.089
You know fuck all
about misery either.

01:31:58.113 --> 01:32:00.849
You should hear the
things I hear.

01:32:02.718 --> 01:32:06.330
You've no idea what some
of those poor bastards

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:08.299
go through everyday.

01:32:08.323 --> 01:32:12.260
Oh yes, and only the great Dr.
Laing can help them.

01:32:13.896 --> 01:32:16.107
Every other single psychiatrist

01:32:16.131 --> 01:32:18.567
in the entire world is wrong.

01:32:19.968 --> 01:32:22.146
Only Dr. Laing can cure them

01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.773
in his famous fucking mad house.

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:27.075
You love all this!

01:32:31.113 --> 01:32:32.113
Angie,

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:35.994
you're all I've got.

01:32:36.018 --> 01:32:39.021
If I lose you, I got,
I've got nothing.

01:32:43.926 --> 01:32:45.894
I can't feel your love.

01:32:48.764 --> 01:32:50.298
I can't feel yours.

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:05.813
You alright?

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:08.660
Fuckers!

01:33:08.684 --> 01:33:10.061
Don't worry everyone, keep calm.

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:12.864
I'm going to sort this out.

01:33:12.888 --> 01:33:17.001
You small minded fucking
hypocritical bastards.

01:33:17.025 --> 01:33:19.904
Come on then, come on then!

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:21.229
Take all this!

01:33:29.805 --> 01:33:31.883
- Yes.

01:33:31.907 --> 01:33:32.951
Hello John.

01:33:32.975 --> 01:33:34.777
- Gentlemen.
- Gentlemen.

01:33:36.378 --> 01:33:37.378
Right.

01:33:43.986 --> 01:33:45.997
Now, Dr. Laing has
taken over the care

01:33:46.021 --> 01:33:48.332
of a former patient of mine,

01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:50.726
an extremely
vulnerable young man.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:56.240
He was responding well to
chlorpromazine and ECT.

01:33:56.264 --> 01:34:01.946
Laing has since withdrawn
all treatment.

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:02.970
So what is he doing?

01:34:04.773 --> 01:34:07.085
Well Dr. Laing is
a great advocate

01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:10.212
of allowing nature
to take its course.

01:34:12.347 --> 01:34:13.725
Meaning?

01:34:13.749 --> 01:34:16.051
He, he lets people go mad,

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:21.289
believing eventually they
will heal themselves,

01:34:23.859 --> 01:34:25.728
or God will.

01:34:27.062 --> 01:34:28.764
And your patient?

01:34:29.898 --> 01:34:32.076
I wasn't allowed to see him.

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.312
Laing said he wanted to be alone

01:34:34.336 --> 01:34:37.348
and that they
respected his wishes.

01:34:37.372 --> 01:34:42.044
And this boy is being allowed
to starve himself to death,

01:34:44.212 --> 01:34:47.449
locked in a room without
vital medication.

01:34:50.152 --> 01:34:52.964
And remind us what
the police found.

01:34:52.988 --> 01:34:55.824
A small amount of
LSD, on license.

01:34:57.359 --> 01:35:00.839
I suggest we make a
formal inspection,

01:35:00.863 --> 01:35:03.866
then move for a
recommendation for closure.

01:35:10.906 --> 01:35:12.250
I'm so sorry

01:35:12.274 --> 01:35:13.274
Ronnie.

01:35:14.309 --> 01:35:16.287
What's happened

01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:17.521
Ronnie, what's wrong?

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:19.782
- Suzie died.

01:35:22.317 --> 01:35:24.186
It's okay, it's okay.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.162
And she shall burn,

01:35:36.832 --> 01:35:39.077
and the kings of the earth

01:35:39.101 --> 01:35:42.513
who have fornicated
deliciously with her

01:35:42.537 --> 01:35:46.474
shall weep and lament at
the smoke of her burning.

01:35:49.277 --> 01:35:51.055
Where's that bastard
you've spawned?

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:52.490
Go on.

01:35:52.514 --> 01:35:54.516
Jim. Jim.

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:57.084
Jim!

01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:01.966
Satan who was cast
out of heaven,

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:03.567
and all his angels.

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.237
- Get out! Go on!
- And all his angels

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.106
delivereth from the world.

01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:09.130
- Enough!
- No.

01:36:10.298 --> 01:36:11.575
Ronnie, Ronnie!

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.444
They shall know who you are,

01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:16.338
they will cast you
out, cast him out.

01:36:17.539 --> 01:36:19.441
What you think about me?

01:36:24.913 --> 01:36:27.225
I know what's happening.

01:36:27.249 --> 01:36:29.129
What's that whore of Babylon
been saying to you?

01:36:32.187 --> 01:36:33.187
- Right.
- No!

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:37.101
Mind his head.

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:38.885
- You're in a lot of pain.
- I'm not in pain.

01:36:38.909 --> 01:36:40.920
You're either gonna hurt
yourself or someone else.

01:36:40.944 --> 01:36:42.173
I can help you.

01:36:42.197 --> 01:36:43.797
- I'll be good!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:45.476
- You have to trust me.
- I'll be good!

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.878
No, no!

01:36:46.902 --> 01:36:48.980
You said no drugs!

01:36:49.004 --> 01:36:50.214
Ahhh!

01:36:50.238 --> 01:36:51.573
Ahh!

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:00.282
You're a traitor.

01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:04.052
You're a fucking hypocrite.
