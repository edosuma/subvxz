01:08.268 --> 01:11.605
Hey mom, happy thanksgiving.

01:12.605 --> 01:15.075
It is now, beautiful.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.241
Hi, Mrs. Matthew.

01:18.243 --> 01:20.110
So good to see you again, Ben.

01:20.112 --> 01:23.650
What has happened to you?
Just a little red.

01:25.385 --> 01:26.984
Hope you like
Southern cooking.

01:26.986 --> 01:30.121
As long as there is that
cranberry sauce, I'm good.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.290
That's good because
I was worried.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.526
Annie really want this first
trip of yours to go great.

01:35.528 --> 01:37.127
Don't you, sweetie?

01:37.129 --> 01:40.801
- Oh, I made my baby cry.
- Stop! No you didn't.

01:42.534 --> 01:46.973
Welcome, to the most
exciting place on Earth.

02:13.332 --> 02:14.631
Ha ha, I know.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.836
I'm telling you, you should
move out of that place.

02:52.838 --> 02:55.205
It's fine, ma, the
cleaner said he is gonna replace

02:55.207 --> 02:57.240
the water heater next
week, so no big deal.

02:57.242 --> 02:58.241
What do you think, Ben?

02:58.243 --> 03:00.345
Uhm, her place is
better than mine.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.812
Yeah. Ben's roommate is...
how do I say it,

03:02.814 --> 03:04.649
He's the worst human being ever.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.951
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we both ought to move?

03:06.953 --> 03:08.620
Right.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.853
So, how's your parents?

03:09.855 --> 03:11.187
Um, they're good,

03:11.189 --> 03:13.056
you know when they found out
that I was going to be here,

03:13.058 --> 03:16.060
they decided to visit my
sister in Boston and her family.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.661
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

03:17.663 --> 03:19.162
And the job, the Facebook thing?

03:19.164 --> 03:21.598
It's probably social
media now since

03:21.600 --> 03:22.966
It's not just Facebook.

03:22.968 --> 03:24.435
You know I just signed
up for it, your aunt Becky

03:24.437 --> 03:27.338
kept pestering me, but I can't
figure the damn thing out.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.707
Like mother like daughter.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.573
Hey, I can figure it out,
I just choose not to.

03:30.575 --> 03:31.875
Sure.

03:31.877 --> 03:34.244
I don't know how people make
money doing that stuff.

03:34.246 --> 03:36.746
I mean in my day, men
had to make things,

03:36.748 --> 03:39.250
build things, work
with their hands.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.788
To be fair, I built
Annie's bookcase.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.454
Oh, it is from IKEA.

03:44.456 --> 03:48.993
It still counts, it's a little
wrenches of death.

03:48.995 --> 03:52.729
I just hope you don't get too
bored here this weekend.

03:52.731 --> 03:54.197
It's not as exciting as Chicago.

03:54.199 --> 03:56.066
That's impossible,
I love it here.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.734
No, she does, she talks
about it all the time.

03:57.736 --> 03:58.903
Her friends are like,

03:58.905 --> 04:01.339
"we're so tired of you
talking about it".

04:01.341 --> 04:03.006
They just don't get it.

04:03.008 --> 04:05.342
What's that fast food place
you keep talking about?

04:05.344 --> 04:07.445
- Bojangles.
- Bojangles.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.413
Yeah, can you believe
he's never had it?

04:09.415 --> 04:10.982
Deprived childhood.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.517
- Slow down, ma.
- Oh, hush.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.918
I should say the
same thing to you.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.620
Be careful, if you're taking
this one out tonight.

04:17.622 --> 04:19.188
Annie has a tendency to get

04:19.190 --> 04:21.527
herself into some
hairy situations.

04:22.562 --> 04:23.961
What, I do?

04:23.963 --> 04:25.796
- She does?
- Hmm.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.298
She's been a wild child.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.233
Now, you hush.
I wasn't that bad.

04:30.235 --> 04:34.106
Aww, I'm just saying there's a
reason I have to color my hair.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.043
Dinner was great Mrs. Matthews.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.111
Thanks Ben, you get enough?

04:41.113 --> 04:43.880
Try and put some meat
on those skinny bones.

04:43.882 --> 04:45.317
I'm good, thanks.

04:47.086 --> 04:48.418
Dreamer, huh?

04:48.420 --> 04:51.255
That's who Annie gets her good
looks from, no doubt.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.225
She's never told
me much about him.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.862
Yeah, well...

04:57.629 --> 04:58.896
Here, let me help you with this.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.029
No, you go relax,

05:00.031 --> 05:02.699
Stop it, you're on vacation.

05:02.701 --> 05:04.004
Okay, okay.

05:12.377 --> 05:14.445
- You ready?
- Yep, ready when you are.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.613
What you looking at?

05:15.615 --> 05:17.248
- Porn.
- Nice.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.548
MILF's or Teens?

05:18.550 --> 05:20.651
- Both actually.
- Gross.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.219
Look, don't go get any ideas.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.421
You're sleeping on the couch
tonight, Mom's rules.

05:24.423 --> 05:25.923
I know.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.461
All right, let's get fucked up.

05:29.528 --> 05:30.831
High five?

05:43.709 --> 05:45.010
- In this bar?
- Yes.

05:45.711 --> 05:47.046
Oh, shit! Annie?

05:47.447 --> 05:48.846
Oh, hey Max.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.813
- How are you?
- I'm great.

05:50.815 --> 05:52.183
Hey, I didn't know
you worked here.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.554
Yeah, God, it's been forever.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.356
Go easy, Annie.

05:58.490 --> 06:00.457
So, what you up to these days?

06:00.459 --> 06:02.058
I live in Chicago now.

06:02.060 --> 06:04.228
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, she does.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.163
I'm sorry, Ben this is Max,
Max, this is Ben.

06:07.165 --> 06:09.168
- Her boyfriend.
- That's great.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.671
<i>Can I get a
beer over here, chief.</i>

06:14.673 --> 06:16.740
Hey, that guy needs a beer.

06:16.742 --> 06:18.612
Yes, he does.

06:20.045 --> 06:21.678
Well, it's great seeing you.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.149
It's great seeing you.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.485
Great seeing you, man.

06:27.319 --> 06:28.521
He's fun.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.485
Hey.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.553
Oh, Ben, this is Paul.

07:03.555 --> 07:06.791
Paul, this is my boyfriend, Ben.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.228
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.096
You getting another round?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.498
Two times, you
the God's two times.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.533
Two times, my ass.

07:15.535 --> 07:19.170
I never knew, she barely
has any drinks at home.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.505
Well, if that's the case,
she's just pretending.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.942
I know the real Annie.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.477
Shut up.

07:25.911 --> 07:27.644
So, Ben, you ever been down

07:27.646 --> 07:29.245
on this part of the
World before?

07:29.247 --> 07:31.449
No, first time in the South.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.449
Wow.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.284
Holiday trip home
with your lady.

07:34.286 --> 07:36.954
Yeah. That's a big deal.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.724
It's a test to see what
sort of a man Ben is.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.159
No bypass.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.594
I mean I couldn't believe it
when Annie moved away.

07:44.596 --> 07:45.796
Just like that.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.264
Poof, she was gone.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.033
And since she
doesn't use Facebook...

07:49.035 --> 07:50.601
Right? She refuses.

07:50.603 --> 07:51.868
I just don't like it.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.639
She doesn't get to see all the
hilarious Youtube videos I post.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.240
And she never gets
to talk to me.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.976
Well, I'm talking to you now.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.381
Yeah. To think I almost
didn't come out tonight.

08:08.019 --> 08:10.620
So, how was yours turkey day?

08:10.622 --> 08:12.490
Oh, it was good.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.194
Mom drank too
much wine as usual.

08:15.927 --> 08:17.594
Sounds about right.

08:17.596 --> 08:20.563
This year my step-dad brought
over his whole family.

08:20.565 --> 08:23.134
Oh, that was a treat, you
remember my little nephews?

08:23.136 --> 08:24.502
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, they're

08:24.504 --> 08:28.005
big tall fuckers now, they just
destroyed my entire house.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.305
Oh, Lord.

08:29.307 --> 08:31.175
Hey, do you still work
at the lumber yard?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.876
Yeah, yeah. The old man's
retiring in a year.

08:33.879 --> 08:36.179
So, he might put me in charge.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.451
That's great, that's great.

08:44.389 --> 08:46.956
There's a article
in the bathroom,

08:46.958 --> 08:48.992
about, there's some
country punk,

08:48.994 --> 08:51.364
and he says that he saw
Big Foot in the woods.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.669
You got something
going here like that?

08:58.937 --> 09:00.405
What?

09:00.407 --> 09:02.138
Oh, Boojum man.

09:02.140 --> 09:05.475
Holy shit, I almost forgot
where we used to go.

09:05.477 --> 09:08.246
What are you
guys talking about?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.583
- Big Foot.
- Yeah, what about him?

09:11.116 --> 09:12.916
Oh, it's nothing.

09:12.918 --> 09:15.018
- Oh, you never told him?
- No.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.720
Some one tell me what.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.756
Actually, I'm not surprised
that you didn't tell him,

09:18.758 --> 09:20.223
it's pretty embarrassing.

09:20.225 --> 09:21.791
What? What's embarrassing?

09:21.793 --> 09:23.295
It's nothing.

09:25.530 --> 09:29.266
Okay, when Annie and
I were in high school,

09:29.268 --> 09:32.172
we were really big into, uh...

09:32.638 --> 09:34.340
What was it called?

09:34.874 --> 09:36.339
Cryptozoology.

09:36.341 --> 09:38.843
- Cryptozoology.
- What?

09:38.845 --> 09:42.813
You know like Big Foot, Loch
Ness monster, shit like that.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.282
Species not yet recognized
by main stream science.

09:46.284 --> 09:48.518
We were couple of dorks.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.722
Wait, what you guys
are like into big foot?

09:51.724 --> 09:52.656
Oh, more than into, I mean

09:52.658 --> 09:54.691
we used to hunt the
thing for Christ sakes.

09:54.693 --> 09:56.261
You, what?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.329
It was nothing, it
was just something

09:59.331 --> 10:00.863
that we used to do
when we were kids.

10:00.865 --> 10:02.699
It was basically just camping.

10:02.701 --> 10:05.201
Yeah, basically.

10:05.203 --> 10:09.339
Oh, okay Annie, you
believe in Big Foot?

10:09.341 --> 10:11.407
- I don't know.
- Oh, she totally does.

10:11.409 --> 10:14.377
Oh, you stop it, you were
always more serious than I was.

10:14.379 --> 10:16.881
No, Jed was the serious...

10:16.883 --> 10:19.148
Oh, my God, Jed!

10:19.150 --> 10:22.118
I'm pretty sure he thought
he was a Big Foot.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.722
He did like to shit
in the woods.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.357
How is he? I'd love
to see him.

10:27.359 --> 10:29.193
I mean he's good, he works at

10:29.195 --> 10:31.027
the Radio Shack over
in Astro. But,

10:31.029 --> 10:32.396
You know what,
I'm actually gonna go...

10:32.398 --> 10:34.263
Wait, wait, wait, okay,
you're changing the subject.

10:34.265 --> 10:36.735
I wanna know more about
the Big Foot hunting.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.470
It was just for fun mostly.

10:40.472 --> 10:43.275
It was, it was a lot of fun.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.578
Big Foot hunting.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.449
Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous.

10:58.957 --> 11:01.324
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

11:01.326 --> 11:04.393
Listen, don't you go get
more that drunk and

11:04.395 --> 11:06.832
and embarrass me in front
of my friends, okay?

11:07.633 --> 11:08.768
Never.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.036
Come on, you take it.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.372
Come on, take it.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.206
My girlfriend doesn't want
me to get too drunk tonight.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.775
Annie? Bullshit.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.310
You're gonna let your
woman tell you what to do?

11:54.312 --> 11:55.512
- Take it.
- Come on, come on.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.850
You just tell Annie, girlfriends
damaged, dude?

11:58.783 --> 11:59.918
All right, all right.

12:02.687 --> 12:06.223
Holy shit! In a jar?
What the fuck is that?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.158
Oh, you gotta share
that shake with me.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.258
Why? Why this?

12:09.260 --> 12:11.094
What? It's moonshine.

12:11.096 --> 12:13.030
- Marcy's uncle makes it.
- Good, eh?

12:13.032 --> 12:14.334
Fuck me.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.370
Hey!

12:22.240 --> 12:23.643
You look good.

12:24.275 --> 12:25.441
Big city girl.

12:25.443 --> 12:27.076
Fuck it, give me another one.

12:27.078 --> 12:28.347
Oh...

13:49.327 --> 13:52.195
Oh, it's so beautiful.

13:52.197 --> 13:54.033
- He did a really good job.
- Yeah he did.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.901
Oh, sorry.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.969
I thought you mid-Western
boys were good at cornhole.

13:59.971 --> 14:01.603
Corn... Okay,

14:01.605 --> 14:04.110
we call it bags and I do okay.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.013
So, how'd you
meet our Annie here?

14:07.980 --> 14:09.579
- At a party
- Cool.

14:09.581 --> 14:10.714
Love at first sight?

14:10.716 --> 14:12.682
Not really, actually, hm...

14:12.684 --> 14:15.084
One of my friends,
dared me to do this

14:15.086 --> 14:16.719
power move on a girl at a bar

14:16.721 --> 14:19.156
and I never hit
on girls at bars.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.257
What's the move?

14:20.259 --> 14:21.791
You walk up to a girl,

14:21.793 --> 14:24.395
take the drink out of
her hand and say, "Hey,

14:24.397 --> 14:25.932
"you look like you
could use a drink."

14:27.066 --> 14:28.866
- Smooth.
- Yeah.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.069
So I tried it on her
and she laughed and...

14:32.071 --> 14:33.837
Guess she got the joke.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.738
Annie's always been
kind of a funny one.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.208
- Yeah.
- Hey, Ben, Jed!

14:38.210 --> 14:40.276
Pay attention you dildos.

14:40.278 --> 14:41.780
- Game point
- All right.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.619
- That is ridiculous.
- She just got in.

14:51.789 --> 14:52.891
Whoa.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.094
Yo! You're still
in public, guys.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.863
Right? I think that they're
actually making a baby.

14:59.865 --> 15:00.866
In front of us.

15:02.167 --> 15:06.502
Well, that's how we celebrate
cornhole victories down here.

15:06.504 --> 15:08.271
Yeah? You should celebrate

15:08.273 --> 15:10.107
- loses that way too.
- Yeah.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.307
Guys, we're on.

15:11.309 --> 15:12.608
We're good to go?

15:12.610 --> 15:14.310
Yep, my buddy's gonna
pick up my shift tomorrow.

15:14.312 --> 15:16.179
Nice!

15:16.181 --> 15:17.984
What? What's happening tomorrow?

15:19.384 --> 15:21.019
We are going Big Foot hunting.

15:21.854 --> 15:22.819
What?

15:22.821 --> 15:24.490
Who is going
big foot hunting?

15:25.124 --> 15:26.857
We are.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.926
We, we are? Wait, I'm
going big foot hunting?

15:29.928 --> 15:31.294
It sounds fun, right?

15:31.296 --> 15:32.362
Well, Jed's got all the gear,

15:32.364 --> 15:34.031
still really into it,
tell him Jed.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.666
I got all the gear,
I'm still really into it.

15:36.668 --> 15:40.436
It'll be great, okay,
we'll camp out, tell stories.

15:40.438 --> 15:42.140
It'll be just like
old times, Ann.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.745
- We're coming too.
- Yeah, sounds fun.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.561
Careful babe.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.427
Later bro.

16:04.429 --> 16:05.730
See you around, Paul.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.075
Morning beautiful.

16:19.077 --> 16:20.743
I thought I'd let you
sleep as long as possible

16:20.745 --> 16:22.445
but it looks like
Paul's already here.

16:22.447 --> 16:25.516
Paul? Here? Now?

16:25.518 --> 16:27.984
Okay, Ben hungover.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.451
Yes, Paul here now.

16:29.453 --> 16:31.888
We give you few
minute to get ready.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.589
Ready for what?

16:33.591 --> 16:35.358
We're going camping, duh!

16:35.360 --> 16:37.292
- We are?
- Yes.

16:37.294 --> 16:38.730
Do you seriously not remember?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.065
No, no, I remember.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.999
I didn't pack anything
for camping you know

16:44.001 --> 16:45.969
- I only brought my shirts.
- It's not, it's no big deal.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.072
I got you covered.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.039
All right.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.176
Oh, shit!

16:52.378 --> 16:53.810
Are you gonna be okay?

16:53.812 --> 16:55.747
We don't have to go
if you don't wanna go.

16:56.414 --> 16:57.783
Do you not wanna go?

16:59.884 --> 17:01.951
No, no, you know
what, I'll be fine.

17:01.953 --> 17:03.853
Okay! Okay!

17:03.855 --> 17:06.190
All right, I'm gonna go shut
him up, you go get ready.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.025
Hurry up, Ben.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.792
Yeah,

17:09.795 --> 17:10.863
Okay.

17:25.309 --> 17:26.678
Morning beautiful.

17:27.913 --> 17:28.978
Hop in.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.682
We were supposed to
pick up Jed an hour ago.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.221
Hello, ladies.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.389
Woah!

19:05.044 --> 19:06.112
Sorry man.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.379
So, were
here now and then

19:09.381 --> 19:11.347
just head here tonight and
set up camp, is that right?

19:11.349 --> 19:13.650
Yeah, yeah that's the spot
where that guy took those

19:13.652 --> 19:15.451
sweet thermal videos.

19:15.453 --> 19:16.586
Then we'll just meet up with

19:16.588 --> 19:18.388
Stan and Marcy's by
this bluff tomorrow.

19:18.390 --> 19:19.722
Who?

19:19.724 --> 19:21.426
Stan and Marcy from last night.

19:24.195 --> 19:26.164
Ben doesn't remember
anything from last night?

19:26.765 --> 19:28.401
Oh, a shot will do that.

19:30.201 --> 19:32.805
Oh, we have to hike at this spot
we can't get there by car.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.740
How long a hike?

19:35.641 --> 19:37.707
12, 15 miles maybe.

19:37.709 --> 19:38.874
I actually never been there

19:38.876 --> 19:40.378
they just recently
opened up those trails.

19:41.012 --> 19:42.312
Stan says it's awesome.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.146
But, you guys know where
you're going though, right?

19:44.148 --> 19:45.748
Don't worry we're
not gonna get lost.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.617
Annie and I used to hunt
around there with our dads.

19:47.619 --> 19:49.186
Fuck off, you used to hunt?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.687
Sure, deer and quail.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.955
Do you ever kill anything?

19:51.957 --> 19:53.422
I once caught a buck.

19:53.424 --> 19:54.460
No big deal.

19:55.026 --> 19:56.491
Hot.

19:56.493 --> 19:57.730
You ever hunted before?

19:58.195 --> 19:59.595
No!

19:59.597 --> 20:01.465
No, I never even shot a gun.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.469
My family wasn't
really outdoors-y.

20:04.001 --> 20:05.602
Really?

20:05.604 --> 20:07.536
I'm sorry, is that weird?

20:07.538 --> 20:09.205
It is in
Montgomery county

20:09.207 --> 20:13.376
Don't let the locals find
out you're just a big city boy.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.144
Scram, piggy.

20:15.146 --> 20:16.846
Hey, shh...

20:16.848 --> 20:18.715
No one's gonna rape you, Ben.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.150
Geez, Jed, I was just kidding.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.617
But, some people
take the Southern

20:21.619 --> 20:23.853
stereotype of hillbilly
as rapists.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.689
Seriously and if Ben is
one of those people...

20:25.691 --> 20:27.323
- Not one of those people.
- But, if he is,

20:27.325 --> 20:28.892
I will assure him,

20:28.894 --> 20:30.526
he's not gonna get raped.

20:30.528 --> 20:32.228
Well, I better not.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.432
You have my word.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.465
Thank you, Jed.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.566
Well, ass raped or not,

20:37.568 --> 20:41.039
this weekend should be a new
experience for you, big city.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.975
- Big city!
- That can be your thing.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.213
- Sorry, big city.
- Yeah, it's a thing.

20:59.824 --> 21:01.024
Are you sure this is safe?

21:01.026 --> 21:03.293
Probably not. You okay?

21:03.295 --> 21:05.027
Yeah.

21:05.029 --> 21:06.763
Better than being
cramped in there.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.868
It's nice out in the fresh air

21:09.701 --> 21:11.700
Oh, I hear the dog
coming at you.

21:11.702 --> 21:14.038
What? Okay, okay.

21:16.273 --> 21:18.007
Oh, God!

21:18.009 --> 21:19.375
Are you okay back there?

21:19.377 --> 21:21.311
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:21.313 --> 21:22.344
Here, give me your hoodie.

21:22.346 --> 21:24.215
I could wring it out and
swallow some of that beer.

21:25.349 --> 21:27.385
Oh, okay.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.824
I'm messing with you, big city.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.557
Oh man, you were
gonna do it too.

21:35.559 --> 21:38.295
You were gonna do it cause
you think I'm just a big fat

21:38.297 --> 21:39.498
beer guzzling hillbilly.

21:40.598 --> 21:42.466
I don't think that.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.767
Like I'd lick beer off
your dirty ass hoodie.

21:45.769 --> 21:48.872
Like some sort of brain
damaged monkey.

21:51.042 --> 21:53.809
Do you mean you're not
a brain damaged monkey?

21:53.811 --> 21:55.914
Screw you man, screw you.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.613
I don't know, I haven't
used those thing in years.

22:30.615 --> 22:31.884
Spider.

22:33.884 --> 22:36.719
- Is this the one?
- No, it's the long black one.

22:36.721 --> 22:37.987
It should be here.

22:37.989 --> 22:39.258
You're having trouble?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.423
I know it's here.

22:41.425 --> 22:43.026
- You need some help?
- No, we got it man.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.559
- You sure?
- Bingo.

22:44.561 --> 22:45.597
Yeah, yeah, we're sure.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.601
- This goes on your side.
- Oh.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.734
Great.

22:50.736 --> 22:51.867
Oh, here, I got it champ.

22:51.869 --> 22:53.201
No, you know I
got it, I was just

22:53.203 --> 22:55.037
thinking about it for a second.

22:55.039 --> 22:57.206
Ben, it's okay,
just let Paul do it.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.976
We need to get it up
before it's too dark and

22:58.978 --> 23:00.809
he can get it up
lot faster than you.

23:00.811 --> 23:02.046
I sure can.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.115
Fine.

23:04.982 --> 23:06.149
When I say I sure can,

23:06.151 --> 23:08.051
right Ben, I was
talking about my dick.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.585
Where you?
Yeah, I got it.

23:10.587 --> 23:12.423
Oh, yeah, excuse me.

23:15.559 --> 23:19.027
And so there's Annie, she's
like 20 feet up in the air,

23:19.029 --> 23:21.064
completely naked.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.167
And everybody's going
like jump, jump, jump.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.003
And I don't think anybody
thought she'd do it.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.304
Did she?

23:27.306 --> 23:29.005
I did.

23:29.007 --> 23:31.074
She cleared the concrete easy,

23:31.076 --> 23:32.709
fell really far
right into the pool.

23:32.711 --> 23:36.412
Oh, my God, you should've seen
how red I was the next day.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.815
Best prom ever!

23:38.817 --> 23:40.883
I can't believe
you skinny dipped.

23:40.885 --> 23:42.619
Well, I was rolling.

23:42.621 --> 23:46.456
That kid Kurt, that kid who went
to prison after high school,

23:46.458 --> 23:47.660
he gave it to us.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.162
- Oh. Huh...
- Oh, Ben doesn't,

23:53.164 --> 23:55.599
- he doesn't smoke.
- Really?

23:55.601 --> 23:58.267
Yeah actually, I don't really
smoke any more either.

23:58.269 --> 23:59.702
I guess I've just
grown out of it.

23:59.704 --> 24:01.506
What? Blasphemy!

24:02.507 --> 24:04.710
Chicago's turning
you into a real square.

24:05.376 --> 24:07.209
No, it isn't.

24:07.211 --> 24:09.548
All right, maybe Chicago isn't.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.719
Give me that.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.786
Come on, I smoke sometimes.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.089
When?

24:24.895 --> 24:26.962
Well, just sometimes I guess.

24:26.964 --> 24:28.567
Ah, come on Annie.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.569
When in Rome.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.841
There you go, you see, you can
try and change her,

24:37.843 --> 24:39.910
she's the still old Annie,
deep down.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.344
You can blow me deep down.

24:41.346 --> 24:43.214
- What's that?
- What now?

25:00.798 --> 25:02.100
I love it out here.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.067
It's about saying it.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.371
It's so much warmer
than Chicago.

25:08.373 --> 25:09.971
If we were out there
the way we're here,

25:09.973 --> 25:12.208
we'd be freezing our nuts off.

25:12.210 --> 25:15.946
See, I need my nuts, I don't
know how you stay there man.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.316
You get used to it.

25:18.182 --> 25:19.550
You gonna stay up there forever?

25:20.184 --> 25:21.519
I don't know.

25:22.253 --> 25:23.719
It's a weird place.

25:23.721 --> 25:24.853
What? No, it isn't.

25:24.855 --> 25:26.489
Oh, I just, I mean that

25:26.491 --> 25:28.857
because of my job or

25:28.859 --> 25:30.727
lack of job.

25:30.729 --> 25:34.098
I'm part-timing, it really
doesn't pay much and

25:35.467 --> 25:36.932
I don't know.

25:36.934 --> 25:39.134
My guess, it's just
weird because...

25:39.136 --> 25:40.471
Don't feel like at home?

25:41.640 --> 25:43.542
Yeah, I guess.

25:44.442 --> 25:45.510
Sometimes.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.777
Why'd you guys call 'em Boojum?

25:48.779 --> 25:50.179
Oh, God! I forgot.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.548
Jed, would you tell
the whole Annie story?

25:52.550 --> 25:54.749
Oh, my God.

25:54.751 --> 25:56.451
A story time with Jed already?

25:56.453 --> 25:58.520
Ben doesn't want
to hear a story.

25:58.522 --> 26:00.125
- I would love to.
- Okay, I'll tell 'em.

26:01.159 --> 26:03.192
Sole piece of Cherokee folklore.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.062
Story goes there was a Big Foot
living up in Hayward County.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.462
Way up in the hollers.

26:07.464 --> 26:10.466
And the Indians
called him Boojum.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.401
He was a mad big fellow and he,

26:12.403 --> 26:13.969
he'd stomp around the woods,

26:13.971 --> 26:15.372
and people when they
heard they thought

26:15.374 --> 26:16.940
that he was a, all sorts of

26:16.942 --> 26:18.708
kinds of thunder.

26:18.710 --> 26:22.210
Now, Boojum likes to hang
out at the local hot springs

26:22.212 --> 26:24.713
and watch the girls take bath.

26:24.715 --> 26:27.449
My kinda guy, this Boojum.

26:27.451 --> 26:30.085
That's common knowledge that
Sasquatch saying something

26:30.087 --> 26:32.054
fierce, so that the girls
would get away.

26:32.056 --> 26:33.722
Common knowledge.

26:33.724 --> 26:35.660
I'm sorry, man, go on.

26:36.693 --> 26:39.194
Right. So, when the girls
would get away from him,

26:39.196 --> 26:41.698
They'd go running
off into the woods screaming.

26:41.700 --> 26:45.104
One day, there was this girl
named, drum roll please.

26:45.903 --> 26:47.135
Annie.

26:47.137 --> 26:49.171
She was kind of a queer sore,

26:49.173 --> 26:51.574
kinda like our Annie here.

26:51.576 --> 26:54.276
She actually fell
in love with Boojum.

26:54.278 --> 26:56.813
Gross, she banged Big Foot?

26:56.815 --> 26:59.449
Ah, story doesn't really go in
to detail about whether they...

26:59.451 --> 27:01.284
Do you ever bang a Big Foot?

27:01.286 --> 27:03.318
It'll probably be
an improvement.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.621
Walked out into that one.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.355
You all stop interrupting
my story, all right?

27:06.357 --> 27:07.690
Y'all asked me to tell it.

27:07.692 --> 27:10.093
All right,
all right, sorry.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.461
Okay, so, Annie,
Boojum become friends.

27:12.463 --> 27:13.996
And they're stomping
through the woods

27:13.998 --> 27:15.765
causing all sorts
of chaos and...

27:15.767 --> 27:16.999
eventually more and more people

27:17.001 --> 27:18.301
started to move in
to the mountains.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.772
So, Boojum had to go deeper
and deeper into the woods.

27:22.007 --> 27:23.307
Annie lost him.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.242
It's sad.

27:27.244 --> 27:30.513
She'd wander through
the woods, lost and lonely,

27:30.515 --> 27:33.185
hooting in horror for
her Boojum to return.

27:34.184 --> 27:35.586
People say, if you listen,

27:36.621 --> 27:39.258
you'd still hear
some nights, hooting.

27:41.558 --> 27:43.862
I wonder if they will
be together again.

28:00.778 --> 28:01.978
Sounds great.

28:01.980 --> 28:05.381
We used to do it by just
banging a stick against a tree.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.815
Locks are better.

28:06.817 --> 28:08.383
Sharper, crisper sound.

28:08.385 --> 28:09.919
Jed's always been
on the cutting edge

28:09.921 --> 28:12.055
of the Sasquatch hunting tech.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.855
What are we listening for?

28:13.857 --> 28:17.058
Sasquatch use tree knocks
to give their location.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.564
If there's any in the area,
they'll give us a reply.

28:20.531 --> 28:21.633
Reply?

28:29.207 --> 28:30.509
Sorry.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.312
Wendigo.

28:33.743 --> 28:34.879
Oh, Yeti.

28:37.481 --> 28:38.549
Skookum.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.385
Nice obscure one.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.789
Ah, Harry.

28:48.826 --> 28:50.394
In, in the Hendersons.

28:54.265 --> 28:55.363
Come on, do it right.

28:55.365 --> 28:56.865
Hey, it's been a long, man.

28:56.867 --> 28:58.236
Yeah, balls are rusty.

28:59.336 --> 29:00.705
You're the one to talk.

29:08.913 --> 29:09.948
That was pretty good.

29:10.882 --> 29:11.917
Yeah.

29:12.983 --> 29:14.885
- You like it?
- Yeah, it's sexy.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.885
You try one.

29:16.887 --> 29:19.956
No, no, absolutely not, no.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.793
- I can't.
- Hey, you can.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.365
It's hard.

29:39.009 --> 29:42.511
That sounds more like a dying
moose than a Sasquatch to me.

29:42.513 --> 29:43.946
How would you even know?

29:43.948 --> 29:45.514
Cause I caught her paws before.

29:45.516 --> 29:46.849
Did you think it was Big Foot?

29:46.851 --> 29:48.017
Positive.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.485
Well, almost positive.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.853
Or at least pretty sure.

29:51.855 --> 29:56.325
Maybe one of them was.
They was just probably Coyotes.

29:56.327 --> 29:59.862
Yeah, Coyotes are other
hunters, howling at each other

29:59.864 --> 30:02.265
thinking that a Big Foot
is howling back.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.232
Teams usually lured
other teams on mind

30:04.234 --> 30:05.534
if they gotta be in the area.

30:05.536 --> 30:07.237
Such doesn't happen.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.673
Did we alert anyone?

30:09.307 --> 30:10.575
Did we?

30:11.108 --> 30:12.376
No.

30:19.116 --> 30:21.052
- You feel okay?
- Yeah.

30:22.119 --> 30:24.487
Little weird.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.892
That weed wasn't really
strong, you'll be fine.

30:29.192 --> 30:30.695
Can't believe you smoked.

30:31.595 --> 30:33.065
Thought you were a pot virgin.

30:34.464 --> 30:36.431
Learn something new everyday.

30:36.433 --> 30:38.869
Yeah, a couple of new stuff
I'm learning about you.

30:39.703 --> 30:40.871
What stuff?

30:42.006 --> 30:44.409
You mean the size of fact
that you believe in Big Foot?

30:47.244 --> 30:48.610
I just, I didn't know
you used to be

30:48.612 --> 30:50.679
such a party girl, that's all.

30:50.681 --> 30:52.414
You're exaggerating, I wasn't,

30:52.416 --> 30:54.653
I'm no worse than
any other teenager.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.490
Why don't you party like
that sometime in Chicago?

30:59.290 --> 31:01.125
We could go skinny dipping.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.362
Lake Michigan.

31:04.261 --> 31:05.496
Yeah, right.

31:12.703 --> 31:14.469
Stop, they'll hear you.

31:14.471 --> 31:15.904
They'll hear me?

31:15.906 --> 31:19.676
Yeah, you and Jed have come in
here and ravage about Sasquatch.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.678
Oh, I bet you'd like that.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.980
Me Boojum.

31:25.316 --> 31:27.052
Seriously, not tonight, okay?

31:38.496 --> 31:40.499
You and Paul seem like
you used to be pretty close.

31:41.365 --> 31:42.666
Yeah, I guess.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.538
Where you two ever?

31:48.272 --> 31:49.607
Where we ever what?

31:50.941 --> 31:51.977
You know.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.614
Where we ever
kidnapped by pirates?

31:56.114 --> 31:57.881
Come on.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.585
I don't, I guess, I don't
know, not really.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.251
What does that mean?

32:03.253 --> 32:04.555
We sort of dated,

32:05.123 --> 32:06.655
in high school.

32:06.657 --> 32:08.894
Oh, whatever, everyone
dates in high school.

32:09.760 --> 32:10.828
No big deal.

32:28.913 --> 32:30.015
Oh.

33:42.653 --> 33:44.652
Oh, wow. Look here.

33:44.654 --> 33:46.154
It's pretty big, damn.

33:46.156 --> 33:48.626
And it's close, I mean it's
right next to our camp site.

33:49.394 --> 33:50.559
Good morning.

33:50.561 --> 33:51.794
Hey dude, check this out.

33:51.796 --> 33:53.298
- What am I looking at?
- It's a track.

33:55.465 --> 33:57.333
- Is it?
- Yeah, see it?

33:57.335 --> 33:58.500
15 inches.

33:58.502 --> 33:59.870
What kind of animal?

34:01.306 --> 34:02.939
Oh, Big Foot, right.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.574
Pretty big. Could be a
full size dog, maybe.

34:05.576 --> 34:06.909
It's awesome.

34:06.911 --> 34:08.811
Take a look at this
indentation here.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.978
You can almost see the
outline of a big toe.

34:10.981 --> 34:12.347
I think I'll get the
tape recorder,

34:12.349 --> 34:13.516
maybe we caught something.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.784
- Oh, unless I get to it first.
- No!

34:16.786 --> 34:19.556
Hey, big city, make yourself
useful and get out of my lab.

34:20.023 --> 34:21.125
Sure.

34:32.902 --> 34:34.436
You good? Feel comfortable?

34:34.438 --> 34:36.706
It's okay. It's heavy.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.311
Maybe don't carry a 1000
beers with you.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.242
It's not 1000.

34:41.244 --> 34:42.880
It's only like, 900.

34:43.847 --> 34:45.282
Right. Try and keep up.

34:46.483 --> 34:49.083
Stan and Marcy's camp's
a long way away.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.769
- Jed.
- Shh...

35:40.070 --> 35:41.206
Jed...

35:44.442 --> 35:45.876
I don't think he
thinks I'm funny.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.244
Shh!

36:05.463 --> 36:07.298
Hey, guys, are we
concerned about...

36:27.351 --> 36:30.119
- Hey pal.
- Hey, buddy.

36:30.121 --> 36:31.686
I mean I had to do
something crazy.

36:31.688 --> 36:32.956
Yeah.

36:36.793 --> 36:38.760
So, Annie tells me that the

36:38.762 --> 36:40.230
two of you are
getting pretty serious.

36:41.264 --> 36:42.933
Says she's your
first real girlfriend?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.270
She told you that?

36:46.704 --> 36:47.936
Ah ah.

36:47.938 --> 36:50.271
I mean not really,
I guess, you know,

36:50.273 --> 36:52.242
she's like the first girl I
have ever genuinely liked.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.747
She is genuinely likeable.

36:58.782 --> 37:00.285
I still don't get why
she moved though.

37:01.918 --> 37:04.153
I don't know man, I guess she

37:04.155 --> 37:07.225
kinda wanted a change, you know,
live in a city for a little bit.

37:07.724 --> 37:09.391
Maybe.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.594
Well, I know that she had some
family stuff that's going on and

37:12.596 --> 37:13.864
I had never seen her stall.

37:14.597 --> 37:16.132
She fits in better down here.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.735
Or she fits in pretty
good up there.

37:19.836 --> 37:21.369
I guess you'd know
better than me.

37:21.371 --> 37:22.537
Yeah.

37:22.539 --> 37:24.141
Just seems weird in my opinion.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.447
We used to be a thing, you know?

37:31.715 --> 37:33.849
Yeah, she might've
mentioned that

37:33.851 --> 37:36.385
you guys sort of
dated in high school.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.990
More than sort of man,
I took her fucking V card.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.160
Yep.

37:45.563 --> 37:49.233
I gotta say man, and don't
be offended by this, but,

37:50.166 --> 37:52.804
I just don't see it.
You and Annie...

37:53.436 --> 37:54.505
You don't, huh?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.142
She's just always been into...

37:58.409 --> 38:01.445
You just seem more like
an indoor kid, you know?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.278
An indoor kid?

38:04.280 --> 38:06.049
I mean, hell, to
each his own right?

38:07.818 --> 38:09.517
Maybe, I just always thought

38:09.519 --> 38:11.956
- when she moved back home...
- She's not moving back home.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.259
She might.

38:15.425 --> 38:16.527
Some day.

38:18.461 --> 38:19.961
What are you getting at?

38:19.963 --> 38:23.331
It's cool man. I mean
she's your girl, right?

38:23.333 --> 38:25.335
It's not like I'm gonna try and
steal her away from you.

38:27.237 --> 38:28.306
Maybe I am.

38:31.909 --> 38:35.313
Oh, shit. You should see the
look on your face right now.

38:36.313 --> 38:38.481
Oh, relax man.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.551
I'm just kidding,

38:41.552 --> 38:42.586
or am I?

39:01.237 --> 39:02.440
Douche bag.

39:04.608 --> 39:05.876
Fuck!

39:11.416 --> 39:13.051
What a fucker!

39:31.668 --> 39:32.903
Whoa!

39:34.003 --> 39:35.572
What was that for?

39:35.940 --> 39:37.175
No reason.

39:37.942 --> 39:39.374
What's that thing?

39:39.376 --> 39:40.708
Stick structure.

39:40.710 --> 39:42.177
Sasquatch are thought
to make them.

39:42.179 --> 39:43.512
And no wild animal
could build a

39:43.514 --> 39:45.617
structure like this at
this level of detail.

39:46.583 --> 39:47.950
I've never seen one before.

39:47.952 --> 39:49.584
Me neither, not in person.

39:49.586 --> 39:50.686
What does it mean?

39:50.688 --> 39:52.054
Not sure.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.925
Some people says it's a
sign of dominance, territorial.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.430
Let's keep moving.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.498
Hang on a sec.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.867
Why don't you guys just
go on. We'll catch up.

40:04.869 --> 40:06.204
I mean, you know the way right?

40:07.204 --> 40:08.538
Let's go off alone
for a little bit.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.474
Okay.

40:14.945 --> 40:17.214
Oh, faced!

40:17.849 --> 40:19.280
- What?
- Faced!

40:19.282 --> 40:20.916
You just got faced by big city.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.117
Stop saying faced.

40:22.119 --> 40:23.784
I don't know why
you got faced, but,

40:23.786 --> 40:25.021
you definitely got faced.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.655
Just shut up!

40:41.739 --> 40:43.074
Stop...

40:50.181 --> 40:52.115
Oh, my God,
this is so amazing!

40:58.422 --> 41:00.490
It looks good,
it's freezing.

41:11.601 --> 41:12.703
It's a cool spot.

41:13.403 --> 41:14.903
Yeah.

41:14.905 --> 41:16.474
I almost forgot I was here.

41:17.307 --> 41:19.610
We used to swim in
this pond sometimes.

41:21.077 --> 41:23.014
It looked a lot bigger
when we were kids.

41:25.081 --> 41:26.849
You know what this
place might be?

41:26.851 --> 41:29.184
- What?
- The place from Jed's story.

41:29.186 --> 41:31.289
You know, Boojum's
peeping time spot.

41:31.922 --> 41:34.255
Yeah, maybe it is.

41:34.257 --> 41:36.126
Maybe, he's watching
us right now.

41:36.793 --> 41:38.462
Yeah, maybe he is.

41:52.675 --> 41:54.909
What's come over you lately?

41:54.911 --> 41:57.479
You're usually so against P.D.A.

41:57.481 --> 42:00.182
and you're just on
me back there.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.652
I just felt like it.

42:08.891 --> 42:10.594
It's nice being alone with you.

42:11.262 --> 42:12.595
Yeah.

42:12.597 --> 42:15.099
It's nice to finally get you
away from those Rednecks.

42:16.032 --> 42:17.199
What?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.536
Well, I mean, just
Paul, Jed's okay.

42:20.170 --> 42:21.471
What's wrong with Paul?

42:25.641 --> 42:28.110
He basically told me that
the only reason he invited us

42:28.112 --> 42:30.713
out here was so that he
could steal you away from me.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.081
What? No, he didn't say that.

42:33.083 --> 42:34.583
Yeah, he did.

42:34.585 --> 42:36.450
Believe me, he didn't.

42:36.452 --> 42:38.519
I think I know my friends
better than you.

42:38.521 --> 42:40.421
I'm telling you, that's
what he said

42:40.423 --> 42:42.023
and by the way, thanks
for telling him

42:42.025 --> 42:44.226
that you're my first
real girlfriend.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.026
What? It's true, isn't it?

42:46.028 --> 42:47.695
I don't want him knowing that.

42:47.697 --> 42:49.664
Oh, he doesn't care.

42:49.666 --> 42:50.798
He's an asshole.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.269
He's not an ass...

42:53.003 --> 42:54.237
Huh.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.639
So, that's what
all of this is about.

42:58.641 --> 43:03.280
You kissing me in front of him
dragging me out here alone.

43:04.047 --> 43:05.646
You're marking your territory.

43:05.648 --> 43:06.784
Yeah.

43:07.983 --> 43:09.650
Me Boojum.

43:09.652 --> 43:11.052
Annie mine.

43:11.054 --> 43:12.586
Stop doing that.

43:12.588 --> 43:14.354
Whenever I'm trying
to have a real

43:14.356 --> 43:16.425
conversation with you, you just,

43:16.427 --> 43:18.392
make some sarcastic comment

43:18.394 --> 43:20.163
and reach for you beer.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.735
You know dude, you
drink too much.

43:26.670 --> 43:28.103
And you use it to hide,

43:28.105 --> 43:30.572
so you don't actually
have to deal with stuff.

43:30.574 --> 43:32.074
That's not true.

43:32.076 --> 43:34.443
Look, I don't have
to drink if it bothers you.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.177
It's your redneck friends

43:36.179 --> 43:38.313
pushing homemade moonshine
and fucking weed on me.

43:38.315 --> 43:39.949
I was just trying to be
nice and fit in.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.148
Isn't that what you
want me to do?

43:41.150 --> 43:42.383
Where are you going?

43:42.385 --> 43:45.722
To catch up with my
redneck friends. Yee-haw.

43:46.556 --> 43:47.724
Annie?

44:01.873 --> 44:03.171
You saw that?

44:03.173 --> 44:05.373
Guy on the news,
big old mountain man.

44:05.375 --> 44:09.244
Guy was like I poked 'em with a
stick and I told him to get.

44:09.246 --> 44:11.746
Get! I mean, he was
in the right area but,

44:11.748 --> 44:14.651
I don't know, he was actually
poking Boojum with a stick.

44:15.219 --> 44:16.717
Hey, guys.

44:16.719 --> 44:18.119
Where'd you two go?

44:18.121 --> 44:19.387
The waterfall.

44:19.389 --> 44:21.824
- These two they had a sighting.
- Oh, yeah?

44:21.826 --> 44:24.494
Saw him joking behind the rocks
just couple of miles from here.

44:26.429 --> 44:27.829
He ain't from
around here, is he?

44:27.831 --> 44:28.996
It's obvious, huh?

44:28.998 --> 44:30.534
He's a big city boy.

44:31.902 --> 44:33.804
Well, they had.

44:35.271 --> 44:36.641
Did you guys shoot at him?

44:37.574 --> 44:38.643
Shoot at who?

44:39.309 --> 44:41.245
Boojum, the Big Foot?

44:43.179 --> 44:44.445
What?

44:44.447 --> 44:46.213
No one's out here
to kill Boojum.

44:46.215 --> 44:47.981
Well, they said they saw him.

44:47.983 --> 44:50.387
And I saw them sitting with
the guns and everything, so...

44:55.125 --> 44:56.291
City boy,

44:56.293 --> 44:58.159
guns is for bear.

44:58.161 --> 45:02.496
And no we didn't shot,
but none of them either.

45:02.498 --> 45:04.935
Hey, why don't you sit down,
champ? You make me nervous.

45:06.336 --> 45:08.438
Think smart before making
men with guns nervous.

45:15.211 --> 45:17.278
Y'all seen no Boojum yet?

45:17.280 --> 45:18.847
Not quite.

45:18.849 --> 45:20.318
Keep them eyes peeled.

45:21.251 --> 45:22.753
You sir, you keep them peeled.

45:23.052 --> 45:24.385
Well.

45:24.387 --> 45:26.354
Are you the only
lady in this group?

45:26.356 --> 45:28.859
I am, but I can handle myself.

45:29.559 --> 45:31.325
She reminds me of the whore.

45:31.327 --> 45:32.795
Whoa, easy there.

45:32.797 --> 45:35.697
Well, easy boys, I won't call
this pretty little lady a whore.

45:35.699 --> 45:37.699
All I meant was
that she reminds me

45:37.701 --> 45:39.869
one other girl I met
out here, one time,

45:40.804 --> 45:44.238
with a pack of guys,
and she was a whore.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.541
That whore was out here
drinking and partying,

45:46.543 --> 45:49.311
earning money no doubt and the
boys up and left her out here

45:49.313 --> 45:50.948
in the woods at night.

45:52.014 --> 45:53.981
Alone half naked.

45:53.983 --> 45:55.650
Which is how I found her.

45:55.652 --> 45:57.318
All bloodied up.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.021
Far away look in her eye.

46:00.023 --> 46:02.792
She kept babbling about some
beast they've been chasing.

46:04.027 --> 46:06.394
Said he was
throwing shit at her.

46:06.396 --> 46:08.463
She was convinced
he was after her.

46:08.465 --> 46:10.132
She actually could smell him.

46:10.134 --> 46:12.599
- Boojum?
- Who knows?

46:12.601 --> 46:14.369
That little girl died
out here that night.

46:14.371 --> 46:16.340
And not a damn thing
I could do to save her.

46:23.079 --> 46:24.847
This ain't a true story, is it?

46:24.849 --> 46:26.046
Are you calling me a liar?

46:26.048 --> 46:27.351
No, no.

46:29.585 --> 46:31.887
Little lady, these woods
is dangerous.

46:31.889 --> 46:34.692
You don't come out here with
a pack of guys you can't trust.

46:38.262 --> 46:40.360
Don't be like that whore.

46:40.362 --> 46:42.966
I won't be like that whore.

46:46.269 --> 46:47.970
- So, we should just...
- Yeah, we should yeah...

46:47.972 --> 46:49.503
get out of here.

46:52.242 --> 46:53.844
Nice meeting you, fellows.

46:59.349 --> 47:01.384
Ya'll be careful out here now.

47:11.193 --> 47:12.394
I thought those
guys were almost

47:12.396 --> 47:13.996
gonna make a lard out of me.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.195
What do you mean?

47:15.197 --> 47:16.466
You know.

47:17.333 --> 47:19.566
Yeah, he asked for a big bread.

47:19.568 --> 47:23.340
Next time you may wanna pucker
up tight, you know just in case.

47:23.907 --> 47:25.443
Sound advice, Jed.

47:27.510 --> 47:28.976
Hey, can I ask you something?

47:28.978 --> 47:29.878
What's up?

47:29.880 --> 47:31.515
- Look, I was wondering...
- Oh, my God!

47:37.788 --> 47:38.987
What is it?

47:38.989 --> 47:40.557
Deer, probably.

47:45.161 --> 47:46.728
Hey, Ben, can you smell that?

47:46.730 --> 47:48.599
Yeah, what the
fuck, what is that?

47:49.365 --> 47:50.898
That's Boojum stink.

47:50.900 --> 47:53.769
Come on, Stan and Marcy's camp
should be just up ahead.

48:05.949 --> 48:07.117
Stan?

48:08.117 --> 48:09.552
Marcy?

48:13.322 --> 48:14.858
This is their
camp site, right?

48:16.159 --> 48:17.661
I think so.

48:18.762 --> 48:20.398
What the hell's this?

48:21.331 --> 48:22.967
What were they doing last night?

48:25.335 --> 48:26.467
Are you okay?

48:26.469 --> 48:28.470
Yeah.

48:28.472 --> 48:29.771
You've just been
acting kinda funny since

48:29.773 --> 48:31.072
you got back from the waterfall.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.374
Look, I'm just, I'm worried
about Stan and Marcy,

48:33.376 --> 48:35.376
they should be here,
shouldn't they?

48:35.378 --> 48:37.244
I mean they're probably
out in the woods

48:37.246 --> 48:39.046
somewhere having sex.

48:39.048 --> 48:42.585
You know their in to that
mother guy, hippie bullshit.

48:43.085 --> 48:44.786
But, their stuff,

48:44.788 --> 48:46.554
it looks like something
bad happened.

48:46.556 --> 48:49.426
Annie, nothing bad
is gonna happen.

48:50.025 --> 48:51.161
I'm here, okay?

48:52.027 --> 48:53.129
I'm here for you.

48:59.068 --> 49:01.936
Hey, uh... they're
not down by the water.

49:01.938 --> 49:03.972
We should split up,
look for 'em.

49:03.974 --> 49:05.507
It's a good idea, Annie
you come with me,

49:05.509 --> 49:07.441
- Jed you take him.
- Why should Annie go with you?

49:07.443 --> 49:08.709
Jed and I are the best trackers.

49:08.711 --> 49:10.181
Ben, it's fine.

49:25.394 --> 49:26.697
Stan?

49:28.197 --> 49:29.632
Marcy?

49:31.601 --> 49:33.170
Hey, what were you
gonna ask me back there.

49:33.804 --> 49:34.802
Huh?

49:34.804 --> 49:36.470
Back there, at the deer.

49:36.472 --> 49:38.307
Oh, huh...

49:38.309 --> 49:42.177
Yeah, I was just wondering about
the whole swatching thing.

49:42.179 --> 49:44.148
Look, I know you're
really into it, but...

49:45.047 --> 49:46.216
And what about them?

49:47.150 --> 49:48.715
You know?

49:48.717 --> 49:50.050
I gotta be honest with you,

49:50.052 --> 49:52.021
this whole thing kinda
came out a little new for me.

49:52.521 --> 49:53.988
I don't know.

49:53.990 --> 49:56.594
We hadn't heard much from Annie
since she moved to Chicago and

49:57.327 --> 49:59.862
I hadn't seen Paul in a while.

49:59.864 --> 50:02.030
To be honest, I never thought
Paul was really into,

50:02.032 --> 50:03.934
it always seemed
kinda like a joke to him.

50:04.802 --> 50:06.767
I know, you must
think it's silly.

50:06.769 --> 50:09.139
Something us, dumb,
country folks do.

50:09.972 --> 50:10.871
That's not true.

50:10.873 --> 50:12.240
Oh, my God!

50:16.179 --> 50:17.947
- What is it?
- Holy shit!

50:22.952 --> 50:24.586
Oh, my God, it's Marcy's finger.

50:24.588 --> 50:25.753
What do you mean
its Marcy's finger?

50:25.755 --> 50:27.124
What the fuck does that mean?

50:38.333 --> 50:40.300
- Black bears.
- Black bears are

50:40.302 --> 50:41.672
pretty rare around these parts.

50:42.371 --> 50:43.907
Coyotes?

50:44.775 --> 50:46.240
What about those hunters?

50:46.242 --> 50:47.775
They were fucking weird, right?

50:47.777 --> 50:49.378
Inbred cannibals living
out in the woods.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.746
You watch too many of those
goddamn wrong turn movies.

50:51.748 --> 50:53.682
It is not really like that
down here, big city.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.383
You gotta stop calling me that.

50:55.385 --> 50:57.284
- Big city.
- Seriously, knock it off.

50:57.286 --> 50:58.586
Stop it.

50:58.588 --> 51:00.856
Look, I admit that those
hunters were weird, but

51:00.858 --> 51:02.324
you guys don't
think they would...

51:02.326 --> 51:05.260
Why not? I mean you heard that
story, the one with the whore.

51:05.262 --> 51:07.131
- I don't know.
- Well, what then?

51:08.864 --> 51:10.432
Boojum.

51:10.434 --> 51:12.534
But, there are all sorts
of trap around here.

51:12.536 --> 51:14.568
I found some hair
samples too, look.

51:14.570 --> 51:16.371
Come on, for real?

51:16.373 --> 51:18.773
I felt like some thing's been
off this whole time.

51:18.775 --> 51:21.108
Like some thing's been
following us, haven't you?

51:21.110 --> 51:22.309
Seriously?

51:22.311 --> 51:23.443
You must still be high.

51:23.445 --> 51:24.845
No, I sensed it too.

51:24.847 --> 51:26.380
Shut up, you didn't sense shit.

51:26.382 --> 51:28.349
You're just saying that
to make me look like an asshole.

51:28.351 --> 51:31.086
I think you're doing an okay job
on that on your own, buddy.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.420
- Fuck you.
- Hey.

51:32.422 --> 51:33.690
Stop it.

51:34.657 --> 51:36.324
Now, last night,

51:36.326 --> 51:39.459
I heard some thing out by the
truck when I was unloading.

51:39.461 --> 51:40.728
I mean it was too
dark to see anything,

51:40.730 --> 51:42.699
I... I tried to snapping
a few pictures.

51:43.398 --> 51:44.768
And when I got a little closer,

51:45.601 --> 51:47.168
some thing threw a rock at me.

51:47.170 --> 51:49.604
Oh, shut up, you're
the one throwing rocks.

51:49.606 --> 51:50.771
What?

51:50.773 --> 51:52.173
Earlier today, by the creek,

51:52.175 --> 51:54.543
you were try to psych me out
saying you trying to fuck Annie.

51:54.545 --> 51:56.811
- Ben!
- Annie, I didn't say that.

51:56.813 --> 51:59.246
Maybe those weren't the words,
but that was the gist of it.

51:59.248 --> 52:02.217
So, wait, some thing
threw a rock at you.

52:02.219 --> 52:03.552
Not some thing, him.

52:03.554 --> 52:04.786
I didn't Annie, I swear.

52:04.788 --> 52:06.287
This is stupid.

52:06.289 --> 52:07.454
Ben come back.

52:07.456 --> 52:08.992
Don't you see though,
some thing did.

52:10.226 --> 52:11.728
Some thing's following us.

52:12.628 --> 52:13.994
Oh, my God!

52:13.996 --> 52:16.530
Am I seriously stuck in these
goddamn woods right now

52:16.532 --> 52:19.066
with 3 adults, who
legitimately think

52:19.068 --> 52:22.237
that a fucking Big Foot
might've killed their friends.

52:22.239 --> 52:24.641
Do you any idea how
insane that sounds?

52:59.909 --> 53:01.010
Hey.

53:01.911 --> 53:03.113
Hey.

53:13.655 --> 53:15.159
When I was 9,

53:16.226 --> 53:18.492
my dad took me camping

53:18.494 --> 53:20.862
up in the
Apple Orchard mountains.

53:20.864 --> 53:23.367
They have this place called
Carpenter's Knob.

53:24.833 --> 53:26.369
It was just the two of us.

53:28.438 --> 53:30.740
I was so excited.

53:33.443 --> 53:35.242
He taught me how
to set up a tent,

53:35.244 --> 53:36.279
build a fire.

53:37.748 --> 53:39.016
Everything.

53:41.184 --> 53:42.486
On the second night,

53:43.652 --> 53:45.455
I was woken up all of a sudden.

53:47.257 --> 53:48.759
I was being carried.

53:49.893 --> 53:52.161
It was my Dad, he was running.

53:54.431 --> 53:57.965
And I couldn't really
get a good look at his face.

53:57.967 --> 53:59.503
No way he was holding me.

54:01.003 --> 54:03.373
But, I could tell, he was upset.

54:05.507 --> 54:08.608
I could feel his heart thumping

54:08.610 --> 54:10.379
through his chest
right in my ear.

54:12.681 --> 54:14.016
He was scared.

54:17.286 --> 54:20.621
He threw me into the truck
and tore out of there.

54:20.623 --> 54:22.759
We left all of our
camping gear behind.

54:26.596 --> 54:29.329
And on the way home, it uh...

54:29.331 --> 54:30.867
looked like he was crying.

54:31.534 --> 54:33.503
- Wow.
- Yeah.

54:34.838 --> 54:38.873
You know my Dad, he wasn't
type of guy who, you know,

54:38.875 --> 54:41.077
you know, he was, he's strong.

54:41.777 --> 54:44.280
You know hunter, army type guy.

54:48.351 --> 54:49.452
I never,

54:50.753 --> 54:53.423
seen him show any
fear until that night.

54:57.793 --> 54:59.797
The look on his face,

55:01.931 --> 55:03.833
that was terrifying.

55:05.534 --> 55:09.137
He saw a Big Foot, didn't he?

55:09.139 --> 55:11.141
That's what he told my Mom.

55:13.009 --> 55:15.041
When we got home,
I spied on them,

55:15.043 --> 55:16.480
they were talking
in the kitchen.

55:18.081 --> 55:20.050
And she laughed and laughed

55:21.351 --> 55:23.220
and told him he was crazy.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.153
Then, not to tell any one,

55:26.155 --> 55:28.424
or else, they'll think
he was crazy too.

55:30.793 --> 55:32.061
But, I knew.

55:37.666 --> 55:39.569
It's the look in his
eyes that night,

55:43.405 --> 55:44.875
that's why I believe.

55:46.675 --> 55:48.108
Annie, I'm...

55:48.110 --> 55:50.112
Me too...

55:54.550 --> 55:56.450
I mean, maybe,

55:56.452 --> 55:58.820
I shouldn't have brought you
home with me this time.

55:58.822 --> 56:00.454
I mean, it was too soon.

56:00.456 --> 56:03.291
No, I'm glad to be here.

56:03.293 --> 56:06.430
It's cool for me to see where
you came from, you know.

56:07.563 --> 56:08.965
Learn more about you.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.369
This trip is really
important to me.

56:15.706 --> 56:16.970
And you're right.

56:16.972 --> 56:18.474
You know, what you said before.

56:19.876 --> 56:21.508
I hide behind sarcasm
or whatever,

56:21.510 --> 56:22.612
I know, I know I do that.

56:25.414 --> 56:26.516
It's just.

56:28.016 --> 56:29.717
I'm afraid if we
have an argument,

56:29.719 --> 56:31.355
it's gonna be the last argument.

56:33.789 --> 56:36.257
You know, at your
Mom's at dinner,

56:36.259 --> 56:37.958
when I said,

56:37.960 --> 56:39.827
maybe we should both
move out of our apartments,

56:39.829 --> 56:41.128
you remember that?

56:41.130 --> 56:43.166
- Yeah.
- I wasn't joking.

56:44.268 --> 56:45.402
I meant that.

56:45.936 --> 56:47.735
Hey, we're going.

56:47.737 --> 56:49.639
Paul says he found
us a short cut back.

57:46.128 --> 57:47.961
How the hell are we lost?

57:47.963 --> 57:49.496
My truck should be right here.

57:49.498 --> 57:51.766
Really, cause it doesn't look
like we were camped last night.

57:51.768 --> 57:52.900
Cause it isn't.

57:52.902 --> 57:54.168
I though you guys have
camped around here

57:54.170 --> 57:55.836
before, I thought
you knew you're way around.

57:55.838 --> 57:57.037
- We do.
- Look, why don't we just go back

57:57.039 --> 57:58.606
- the way we came.
- I don't know, Ben. Jesus!

57:58.608 --> 58:00.775
Why don't you guys
just whip your dicks out?

58:00.777 --> 58:02.110
See whose is big already.

58:02.112 --> 58:04.481
Damn, I'm sick of this,
the two of you bitch!

58:06.615 --> 58:07.751
Oh, my God!

58:08.784 --> 58:10.153
You're fucking with me?

58:10.887 --> 58:12.286
- What?
- Oh, we happen

58:12.288 --> 58:14.287
to take a short cut
and now we're lost.

58:14.289 --> 58:16.590
No, we all wanted to get out
of here after what we just saw.

58:16.592 --> 58:18.027
Oh, what we just saw?

58:18.628 --> 58:19.663
Sure.

58:20.463 --> 58:21.565
What does that mean?

58:59.936 --> 59:01.302
You honestly
think this is a joke?

59:01.304 --> 59:02.503
Your friends are dead.

59:02.505 --> 59:04.003
- Seriously, knock it off.
- We all know that.

59:04.005 --> 59:05.171
Hell, we could've been in on it.

59:05.173 --> 59:06.474
We didn't see any
bodies or any thing.

59:06.476 --> 59:08.708
Then whose fucking
finger was that?

59:08.710 --> 59:10.177
I don't know, it could've
been a fake,

59:10.179 --> 59:11.579
I didn't get that
good a look at it.

59:11.581 --> 59:12.780
Why you're a genius?

59:12.782 --> 59:15.215
I carry a fake severed finger
around with me to pull pranks

59:15.217 --> 59:16.784
on idiots like you!

59:16.786 --> 59:18.019
Why would I do that?

59:18.021 --> 59:19.253
To make me look
bad in front of Annie

59:19.255 --> 59:20.490
cause you're trying to fuck her.

59:21.123 --> 59:22.322
Trying to?

59:22.324 --> 59:24.326
Don't forget, brother,
I already have.

59:27.130 --> 59:29.199
Annie, he egged me on.

59:31.001 --> 59:34.438
Just get us out of these fucking
woods before it gets dark, okay?

59:49.985 --> 59:51.253
It's this way, come on.

01:00:08.804 --> 01:00:10.170
Oh, my God!

01:00:10.172 --> 01:00:11.707
Oh, shit!

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.545
Hey, Jed watch
out for the...

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.282
Oh, God! Oh, fuck.

01:00:22.284 --> 01:00:24.617
Holy shit, there's a big
fucking stick in your leg.

01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:25.820
What?

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:26.954
It isn't that bad.

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.121
All right, I think
it's pretty if I

01:00:28.123 --> 01:00:29.188
can just get this
over real fast.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:30.557
Get what over fast

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:33.760
You idiot, taking it out is
gonna make it worse,

01:00:33.762 --> 01:00:34.795
now he's gonna bleed out.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.664
- I'm what?
- What the fuck do put it back in?

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:37.798
No.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.902
Oh, God, it hurts.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.469
You'll be okay.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.405
Ah we don't have to worry
about a goddamn Big Foot,

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:47.477
we gotta worry about
big killing me too.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:52.749
Is that funny?

01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:55.284
Holy shit!

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:06.260
I thought you said Big Foot was
near the valley, Jed.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.662
Mee-Maw thought they were.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.764
- Keep moving.
- Maybe, every body's

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:11.065
got their facts wrong or

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.436
maybe this one's
sick or some thing.

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.603
What?

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:16.740
You said facts.

01:01:20.409 --> 01:01:22.110
I'm so sorry, Jed.

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:23.311
For what?

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:24.912
For not talking
you for years and

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.813
forcing you to bring
us out here.

01:01:26.815 --> 01:01:27.917
You didn't force me.

01:01:28.884 --> 01:01:30.318
Yeah, but I should've known.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.820
You know, not to... bring...

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.488
The actual skeptic.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.858
Come on, you used
to guys fighting over you.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.228
Remember our high school?

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.829
Hey, hold up a minute, guys.

01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:44.197
We need to keep moving.

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:45.999
Look guys, I've been thinking...

01:01:46.001 --> 01:01:47.467
- Some Chipotle?
- Paul?

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:49.436
That doesn't even
make any, whatever.

01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:50.905
Look, you guys say
that the Sasquatch is

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:53.575
one of the most elicit
creatures on the planet, right?

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.776
I mean thousands
of years of civilization and we

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.612
still don't have a concrete
proof that he exists, right?

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.847
- Right.
- Your point?

01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:04.351
Doesn't all of this seem a
little bit too convenient then?

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.387
You know, why would
Sasquatch do this?

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.258
Doesn't he wanna
remain undiscovered?

01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:11.559
It's following us.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.230
He wants some thing from us.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.769
- Oh, God, I'm hallucinating.
- What?

01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:24.371
Over there.

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:25.775
I'm seeing cabins.

01:02:48.864 --> 01:02:50.130
This will do.

01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:52.231
Yeah, what if the
owners come back?

01:02:52.233 --> 01:02:54.501
I feel like those fucking
hunters back there.

01:02:54.503 --> 01:02:57.007
Look around, no one's been
here for a while, we're fine.

01:02:58.807 --> 01:03:01.008
Oh, Jed!

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.445
Something to ease the pain.

01:03:03.945 --> 01:03:05.481
Thanks, Big City.

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:11.151
Holy shit.

01:03:11.153 --> 01:03:12.655
This is what I'm talking about.

01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:18.360
So...

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.399
What do we do now?

01:03:39.547 --> 01:03:41.016
Hey, where's your bracelet?

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:43.617
I lost it.

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.753
What? where?

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:47.588
I'm not sure.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.894
I think it must've been some
where near the mines.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.161
What mines?

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.996
There's this ravine,

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.465
up the hill from where you two
idiots were fighting and

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.434
it was all fenced off.

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:03.373
I heard some thing growl
and I got spooked.

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:05.805
A Big Foot lair?

01:04:05.807 --> 01:04:08.411
Why didn't you tell me when you
realized when you lost it.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:11.479
We should go looking for it.

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:15.118
What? No way, we're
not going back out there.

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:18.688
What's so important about
a dumb little bracelet?

01:04:20.155 --> 01:04:21.757
Her Dad gave it to her.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:39.742
What is it?

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:42.242
I don't know.

01:04:52.387 --> 01:04:53.854
It's him.

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:54.991
Shh...

01:05:00.228 --> 01:05:02.028
Oh, my God,
it's Big Foot!

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.195
Must be.

01:05:03.197 --> 01:05:04.498
It's not Bi Foot!

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.733
- Yes, it is.
- It's not

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.537
a fucking Big Foot, okay?

01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:11.039
Big Foot isn't real.

01:05:16.978 --> 01:05:18.878
You still think I'm
messing with you?

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.447
Yeah, I do.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.182
It could be your stupid
little buddies out there,

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:24.150
running around, making noise.

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:25.586
Then, go out there and check.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:28.088
- What?
- Listen,

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.025
I promise on my Grandma's grave,

01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:34.595
if I'm messing with you
and you're right,

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.099
I'll call the whole thing off.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.534
You'll never hear from me again.

01:05:39.768 --> 01:05:41.804
Just step out that
door and look.

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.940
- Okay.
- Ben, don't.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.874
Yeah, can the two of you stop
trying to be the alpha male

01:05:47.876 --> 01:05:49.709
for a second and
think about this?

01:05:49.711 --> 01:05:51.447
If I'm going out there,
you're coming with me.

01:05:52.047 --> 01:05:53.215
You're bringing the gun.

01:05:58.655 --> 01:06:00.052
So, how far
do you wanna go?

01:06:00.054 --> 01:06:02.491
You tell me, this
was your big idea.

01:06:03.858 --> 01:06:06.126
Can I let you in
on a little secret?

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:07.894
Now, it's just me and you.

01:06:07.896 --> 01:06:10.296
I think this whole
Big Foot thing is bullshit.

01:06:10.298 --> 01:06:11.566
I fucking knew it!

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:12.898
Even when we
were kids you know,

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.601
I just kept up with it
to keep Annie happy.

01:06:15.603 --> 01:06:17.239
Same reason you're
out here now, right?

01:06:18.206 --> 01:06:19.805
Come on man, you ain't dumb.

01:06:19.807 --> 01:06:21.775
People who believe
in Big Foot are insane.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.344
Yeah, well, Annie is not insane.

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.849
Yeah, I see the apple didn't
fall too far from the tree.

01:06:27.382 --> 01:06:28.750
The hell does that mean?

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.722
So, you don't know how
her Dad died?

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:35.992
No, she never told me.

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:38.224
He was insane.

01:06:38.226 --> 01:06:39.828
Like certifiably so.

01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:43.063
He died in a mental institution.

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:45.833
So, yeah, if she ever tells you
some story about

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.934
him finding Big Foot
out on his own,

01:06:47.936 --> 01:06:50.204
Whatever, man, we shouldn't even
be out here let's just go back.

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.641
- He's not one of your...
- He no friend of mine.

01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:56.911
Should we freeze
or should we run?

01:06:56.913 --> 01:06:59.081
- You freeze, I'll run.
- What?

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.454
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.789
Where's Ben?

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.590
Come on, we gotta
get back inside, right now.

01:07:10.592 --> 01:07:11.992
- Where is he?
- He's gone, huh.

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:14.193
I don't know, he took a
swing at me and ran off.

01:07:14.195 --> 01:07:15.632
He took a swing at you?

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:18.601
Ben?

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:21.001
Ben?

01:07:25.106 --> 01:07:26.340
Ben!

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:27.606
Shut the
fuck up, let's go.

01:07:27.608 --> 01:07:29.041
We need to find him.

01:07:29.043 --> 01:07:32.512
Annie, listen, he's gone,
he's fucking gone, okay?

01:07:32.514 --> 01:07:33.981
And I'm here, I'm here for you.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.581
How many times do I have
to fucking say that?

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:37.418
- Let me go.
- Look, Ann, I care about you.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.918
- I really do.
- I'm with Ben.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.722
Why? I mean why the fuck? What
do you even see in that guy?

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.157
- He's...
- What?

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.557
He's...

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:45.961
He's what goddammit?

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.429
He's right behind you.

01:07:49.664 --> 01:07:52.331
Ah, fuck, Annie, Annie!

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:54.670
Annie!

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.083
Come on, come on
Annie, let's go.

01:08:10.985 --> 01:08:12.254
It got Paul.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:22.395
Oh, my God,
it's fucking Big Foot!

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.932
How can this be happening?

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:27.433
Hey, you said they
were non-violent.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:28.602
What the fuck do you call that?

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.536
- I don't know.
- Oh, God!

01:08:30.537 --> 01:08:32.839
What are we supposed to do? You
are supposed to be the expert.

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.309
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

01:08:34.908 --> 01:08:36.045
Oh, shit.

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:50.890
He left, why would he?

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:53.630
Maybe he's just after Paul maybe
that's what he wanted and...

01:09:01.368 --> 01:09:02.602
What the fuck?

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:03.872
Oh, my God!

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.755
It got pretty
bad there by the end.

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.490
The doctor said that
his schizophrenia

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.328
had become completely
unmanageable.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.868
And a lot of times
he didn't even know

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.902
Who any of us were.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.207
He was sick.

01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:42.176
But, he wasn't insane.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.184
How come you never
told me before?

01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:57.859
Maybe you'd think
that I'd go crazy too.

01:10:00.895 --> 01:10:02.331
Is that why you moved away?

01:10:06.534 --> 01:10:07.804
Sort of.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.041
I think there are lot of things

01:10:15.043 --> 01:10:18.245
for my life here that
I needed to hide from

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.115
You never have to hide
anything from me.

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:29.324
Yeah.

01:10:30.525 --> 01:10:31.793
I know that now.

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.396
Come on.

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.833
We're getting out of here.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.448
Up there.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.856
- Oh, God.
- Hold on.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.095
Oh, God.

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:09.164
- What are you?
- We need his keys.

01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:15.371
Okay, okay I got them.

01:11:17.605 --> 01:11:18.973
Hey!

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:20.139
Ben!

01:11:20.141 --> 01:11:21.075
Annie!

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:24.044
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.178
I'm going after her.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.350
- What?
- I got to. I love her man.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.987
Do you, ah, do you even
know how to use that thing?

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:35.822
Just point at something
hairy and pull the trigger.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.456
I got it.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.083
Annie!

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:11.226
Annie!

01:12:16.698 --> 01:12:19.132
Oh fuck, what if his?

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:20.532
I'm sorry Mrs. Matthews,

01:12:20.534 --> 01:12:23.305
your daughter was abducted
by a a fucking Sasquatch.

01:12:24.706 --> 01:12:26.509
Oh, come on man,
where did you take her?

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:53.536
Oh, shit.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.314
Oh!

01:13:14.222 --> 01:13:15.388
Oh, God!

01:13:31.806 --> 01:13:33.041
Ben!

01:13:33.708 --> 01:13:34.976
Oh, shit!

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:21.222
Look what I found,
no big deal.

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:27.697
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.638
Ranger's on his way

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.642
and they're sending
an ambulance for Jed.

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:16.712
I don't have insurance.

01:15:19.113 --> 01:15:21.315
- Hey Ben,
- Yeah.

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:24.052
Think you could show me
on map where that ravine was?

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.622
Maybe, why?

01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:29.024
Just curious.

01:15:38.199 --> 01:15:40.036
Everybody got their
stories straight?
