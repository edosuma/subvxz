00:01.302 --> 00:03.204
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
Faith, no!

00:03.237 --> 00:05.173
You killed a man.
I don't care.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.474
ANGEL:
 She's taken a life.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.976
She's got a taste for it now.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.644
Guess that means
you have a job opening.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.048
GILES:
The necklace is
a symbol of Anyanka.

00:14.082 --> 00:17.050
She's a-a demon
 that grants wishes.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.986
I wish Buffy Summers had
never come to Sunnydale.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.888
Done.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.390
(snarls)

00:22.422 --> 00:24.358
I love this part.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.894
(indistinct chatter)

00:27.928 --> 00:28.995
(snarls)

00:29.028 --> 00:30.931
GILES:
 Somehow, Cordelia's wish

00:30.963 --> 00:31.998
changed this world.

00:32.031 --> 00:32.932
If we can destroy the necklace,

00:32.966 --> 00:35.368
we will undo the wish,

00:35.402 --> 00:37.204
rendering Anyanka
 mortal and powerless.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.412
Do not ask again.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.715
ANYA:
But, but...

00:47.747 --> 00:49.750
Your powers were a gift
of the lower beings.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.918
You have proved
unworthy of them.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.186
I was robbed
of them.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.423
By your carelessness.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.856
For 1,000 years

00:56.890 --> 00:59.026
I wielded the powers
of the wish.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.293
I brought ruin

01:00.328 --> 01:02.096
to the heads of
unfaithful men.

01:02.130 --> 01:05.063
I brought forth
destruction and chaos

01:05.099 --> 01:06.599
for the pleasure
of the lower beings.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.236
I was feared and worshiped
across the mortal globe.

01:09.269 --> 01:12.706
And now I'm stuck
at Sunnydale High.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.542
Mortal.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.277
Child.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.112
And I'm flunking math.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.149
This is no concern of ours.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.617
You will live out
your mortal life and die.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.587
Give me another chance.
You can fold the fabric of time.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.257
Send me back to that place
and I'll change it.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.459
I won't fail again.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.394
Your time is passed.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.796
Do you have any idea how boring
12th-graders are?

01:36.829 --> 01:38.299
I'm getting
my power center back.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.433
And if you
won't help me,

01:40.468 --> 01:42.936
then by the pestilent gods,
I will find someone who will.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.146
BUFFY:
The Watcher Council shrink

01:52.180 --> 01:53.947
is heavy into tests.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.348
He's got tests
for everything.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.350
T.A.T.S, Rorschach,

01:57.384 --> 01:59.520
associative logic...

01:59.552 --> 02:01.522
He even has that test
to see if you're crazy

02:01.555 --> 02:02.790
that asks if you
ever hear voices

02:02.822 --> 02:04.024
or you ever wanted
to be a florist.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.493
Ooh, I used to want...
Wait.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.360
Florist means crazy, right?

02:08.395 --> 02:10.030
I never wanted to do that.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.799
Neat.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.300
Thanks.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.002
It's all about
emotional control.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.205
Plus, obviously, magic.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.639
Hey, you want to go
to the Espresso Pump

02:19.673 --> 02:20.873
and get sugared up on mochas?

02:20.908 --> 02:22.141
I'm gonna pass.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.211
Hit the pool and do some laps.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.813
How come the sudden
calisthenics?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.115
Aren't you sort of
naturally buff, Buff?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.485
(chuckles)
Buff Buff.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.221
Well, they've got us
running around on
the physical side, too.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.521
A lot of reflex evaluation

02:34.555 --> 02:35.656
and precision training,
you know.

02:35.688 --> 02:38.125
I just... well, I want to do...

02:38.158 --> 02:39.860
Better than Faith?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.795
So very shallow.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.566
Competition is
natural and healthy.

02:45.598 --> 02:48.701
Plus, you'll definitely
ace her on the psych tests.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.971
Just don't mark
the box that says

02:51.003 --> 02:52.906
"I sometimes like
to kill people."

02:52.939 --> 02:57.311
I know Faith's not gonna be
on the cover of Sanity Fair,

02:57.344 --> 02:59.379
but she had it rough.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.649
Different circumstances,
that could be me.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.015
No way.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.919
Some people just don't
have that in them.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.155
Look, I'm sorry.

03:08.187 --> 03:09.856
I know how you hate
talking about Faith.

03:09.889 --> 03:11.692
No, it's okay.

03:11.724 --> 03:12.893
No, really, we should just...

03:12.925 --> 03:14.161
No, it doesn't
bother me.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.263
I mean it.

03:15.295 --> 03:17.598
Uh, Will?

03:17.631 --> 03:19.733
Oh.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.408
Emotional control?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.443
I'm working on it.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.449
(wolf howling)

03:35.483 --> 03:37.585
*

04:25.499 --> 04:27.500
(indistinct chatter)

04:29.470 --> 04:30.971
As far as I'm concerned,

04:31.004 --> 04:33.973
this is a marriage
made in heaven.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.608
Willow Rosenberg,

04:35.643 --> 04:39.579
despite her unsavory
associations,

04:39.612 --> 04:41.481
represents the pinnacle
of academic achievement

04:41.514 --> 04:43.651
at Sunnydale High.

04:43.683 --> 04:47.321
Percy West represents
a devastating fast break

04:47.355 --> 04:49.790
and 50% from behind
the three-point line.

04:51.290 --> 04:54.261
I'm not sure I understand
the marriage part.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.295
You've got the brains,

04:56.329 --> 04:57.665
he's got the fast break.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.266
It's a perfect match.

04:59.298 --> 05:00.867
Match?

05:02.370 --> 05:04.605
You want us to breed?

05:04.637 --> 05:06.706
I want you to tutor him.

05:06.740 --> 05:10.143
Percy is flunking history.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.545
Nothing seems to be able
to motivate him.

05:11.579 --> 05:14.113
Hey, I'm challenged.

05:14.146 --> 05:16.283
You're lazy,
self-involved and spoiled.

05:16.315 --> 05:17.518
That's quite the challenge.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.052
But we need
a winning year,

05:20.086 --> 05:22.221
especially after
last year's debacle

05:22.254 --> 05:24.057
with the swim team.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.625
Can't have our
point guard benched.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.795
So, you're gonna take on
a little teaching job.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.062
I know how you enjoy teaching.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.298
Well, I have a lot
of work of my own.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.632
You've got a letter
of acceptance

05:32.665 --> 05:34.735
from every university
with a stamp.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.903
Yes, but I still have
classes and I don't...

05:36.937 --> 05:38.572
SNYDER:
Rosenberg...

05:38.605 --> 05:41.040
It's time to give something back
to the community.

05:43.209 --> 05:46.312
I know you want to help
your school out, here.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.380
Ask me how I know.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.548
How do you...

05:48.581 --> 05:51.884
I just know.

05:51.918 --> 05:55.822
So he threatened you?
With what?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.692
Well, it wasn't exactly
anything he said.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.259
It was all in his eyes.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.894
I mean, there was some
nostril work as well,

06:01.928 --> 06:03.564
but mostly eyes.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.766
Snyder needs me
to kick his ass.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.334
Oh, no, Buffy,
don't get in trouble.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.701
I'll be okay.

06:08.735 --> 06:12.004
I just hate the way
he bullies people.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.608
He just assumes
everyone's time is his.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.276
Willow, get on
the computer.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.677
I want you to
take another pass

06:17.711 --> 06:18.911
at accessing
the Mayor's files.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.613
Okay.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.182
Well, that
was a blast.

06:22.214 --> 06:23.417
How did it go?

06:23.451 --> 06:25.117
Princess Margaret here

06:25.151 --> 06:27.319
had a little trouble
keeping up.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.723
How did it go?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.459
(breathing heavily)

06:31.492 --> 06:33.694
Faith, uh... did quite well
on the obstacle field.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.295
Still a little
sloppy, though.

06:35.327 --> 06:37.064
GILES:
Do you feel up to, uh,

06:37.096 --> 06:39.867
taking Buffy out, or shall I?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.101
Oh, no, no, no,
I'll be fine.

06:42.134 --> 06:44.538
Just, uh, give me
a minute.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.906
And some
defibrillators,

06:45.939 --> 06:47.139
if it's not
too much trouble.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.442
FAITH:
You're gonna love it, B.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.711
It's just like fun,
only boring.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.944
GILES:
Faith,

06:51.978 --> 06:53.447
this evaluation is a necessary

06:53.480 --> 06:54.715
part of the council...
FAITH:
I know.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.949
I'm on board here.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.283
Just shooting my mouth off.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.952
I better change.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.857
Good luck.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.834
What you doing?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.803
I'm trying to access
the Mayor's personal files.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.572
Can you do that?

07:18.605 --> 07:21.509
Well, he's got some
tricky barriers set up.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.276
Can you get past 'em?

07:23.310 --> 07:26.846
Eventually, I'll get through.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.317
That's very interesting.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.853
Yeah, I thought so, too.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.754
Are you serious
about this place?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.624
Of course I am.
No slayer of mine

07:36.656 --> 07:38.290
is gonna live in
a fleabag hotel.

07:38.324 --> 07:40.994
That place has a very
unsavory reputation.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.797
There are immoral liaisons
going on there.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.365
Yeah, plus all the screwing.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.667
This place is the kick.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.000
We'll keep your old place,

07:48.034 --> 07:49.435
in case you need to see
your friends there,

07:49.468 --> 07:50.937
but from now on...

07:50.971 --> 07:52.505
Oh, hey. Hey, hey,
shoes. Shoes.

07:54.406 --> 07:56.375
Thanks, Sugar Daddy.

07:56.408 --> 07:58.444
Now, Faith, I don't find
that sort of thing amusing.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.913
I'm a family man.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.882
Now, let's kill
your little friend.

08:04.884 --> 08:07.153
Don't worry.
I wouldn't ask you to do it.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.288
Not this early
in the relationship.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.891
Besides, I think
a vampire attack

08:11.925 --> 08:14.694
would less
suspicious, anyway.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.663
In the meantime, let's take
a look at the rest
of the apartment, huh?

08:16.697 --> 08:17.730
If I'm not mistaken,

08:17.764 --> 08:19.199
some lucky girl

08:19.231 --> 08:21.033
has herself a PlayStation.

08:21.067 --> 08:21.968
No way.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.036
Yes way. (chuckles)

08:26.839 --> 08:28.175
Hey.

08:28.207 --> 08:29.576
Oz. Hi.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.011
There's something
about you

08:31.043 --> 08:32.980
that's causing me
to hug you.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.914
It's like I have
no will of my own.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.485
Where were you yesterday?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.854
Mmm. We got back late,
sort of very.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.722
We? Who? Where?

08:42.755 --> 08:45.725
The band. We had a gig
in Monterey Sunday night.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.760
Oh, you did?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.495
How come I didn't know?

08:49.528 --> 08:51.097
I thought you did.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.067
Maybe I would
have liked to go.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.403
Didn't figure you
for missing school.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.770
You think I'm boring.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.105
I'd call that

08:59.139 --> 09:00.908
a radical interpretation
of the text.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.845
We're playing tonight
at the Bronze.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.181
I can't.
I have too much homework.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.783
If you get done early...

09:15.154 --> 09:17.124
Percy. Hey.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.860
Listen, I thought we could
get together today at lunch

09:19.893 --> 09:22.528
and go over
your Roosevelt paper.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.230
You know, what books
you'll need and stuff.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.865
What are you
talking about?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.967
Me tutoring you.
Your-your history paper?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.403
Oh, yeah, yeah. Snyder said
you were gonna do it.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.605
He never said that.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.707
What meeting
were you at?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.209
Look, I'll get
the books you need.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.778
Just meet me at lunch
and we'll...

09:37.811 --> 09:39.245
No, no, no. I don't
have any time at lunch.

09:39.278 --> 09:40.614
I gotta hang out.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.881
Well...

09:41.914 --> 09:43.951
What, you got something
better to do?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.119
Just type it up and
put my name on it.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.655
Oh, and don't type
too good. Dead giveaway.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.136
I'm eating this now.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.740
It's not lunchtime,
I don't even care.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.676
Hey.
Willow,

10:08.708 --> 10:11.110
did you remember to tape
 Biography last Friday?

10:11.144 --> 10:12.412
Uh-huh.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.347
See, I told you.
Old Reliable.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.149
Oh, thanks.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.318
What?
Old Reliable?

10:19.351 --> 10:20.754
Yeah, great.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.657
There's a sexy nickname.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.491
Well, I didn't
mean it as...

10:25.524 --> 10:26.759
No, it's fine.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.260
I'm Old Reliable.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.697
XANDER:
She just means,
you know,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.932
the geyser. You're
like a geyser of fun

10:31.965 --> 10:34.033
that goes off at
regular intervals.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.836
That's Old Faithful.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.038
Isn't that the dog
that the guy
had to shoot...

10:38.071 --> 10:39.673
That's Old Yeller.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.207
Xander, I beg you
not to help me.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.842
Will, I didn't mean it
as a bad thing.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.211
I think it's good
to be reliable.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.715
Well, maybe I don't want to be

10:47.748 --> 10:49.817
reliable all the time.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.153
Maybe I'm not just
some doormat person.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.386
Homework Gal.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.256
I'm thinking
nerve strike.

10:59.591 --> 11:01.494
Maybe I'll change my look.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.363
Or cut class.
You don't know.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.198
And I'm eating this banana,

11:06.232 --> 11:08.368
lunchtime be damned.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.303
Will, wait.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.504
I'm really sorry.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.008
Buff, I'm storming off.

11:15.042 --> 11:18.345
It doesn't really work
if you come with me.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.947
Oh.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.192
Uh, Willow?

11:33.225 --> 11:35.595
Uh, hi.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.365
Anya. I'm sort of new here.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.665
Um, I know Cordelia.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.835
Oh, fun.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.671
Yeah. Um, listen,

11:44.703 --> 11:46.572
I have this little
project I'm working on,

11:46.605 --> 11:48.441
and I heard you were
the person to ask...
Yeah, that's me.

11:48.475 --> 11:52.011
Reliable Dog Geyser Person.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.245
What do you need?

11:53.279 --> 11:55.048
Oh, it's nothing big.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.750
Just a little spell
I'm working on.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.350
A spell?

11:58.384 --> 12:01.620
Oh. I like the black arts.

12:01.653 --> 12:04.024
I just need a secondary
to create a temporal fold.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.557
I heard you were
a pretty powerful Wicca, so...

12:05.591 --> 12:07.927
You heard right, mister.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.197
I'm always ready to work
some dark mojo.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.966
So, tell me,
is it dangerous?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.302
Oh, no.

12:16.336 --> 12:20.106
Well, could we pretend it is?

12:20.139 --> 12:22.609
ANYA:
The necklace was
a family heirloom

12:22.642 --> 12:24.977
passed down for generations.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.279
Then it was stolen
from my mom's apartment.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.716
How does the spell work?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.717
Uh, well...

12:31.750 --> 12:35.154
We both call on Eryishon,
the Endless One,

12:35.187 --> 12:37.790
offer up the standard
supplication,

12:37.825 --> 12:41.394
then there's a teensy
temporal fold... we hope.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.596
Um, then I pour
the sacred sand

12:43.629 --> 12:45.664
on the representation
of the necklace,

12:45.697 --> 12:46.966
and Eryishon brings it forth

12:47.000 --> 12:48.567
from the time and place
it was lost.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.070
Cool.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.403
Are we ready?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.306
I think so.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.341
(exhales)

12:55.375 --> 12:57.744
Eryishon. K'shala.
 Meh-uhn.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.647
Diprecht. Doh-tehenlo
 nu-Eryishon.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.817
The child to the mother.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.086
The river to the sea.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.855
Eryishon, hear my prayer.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.801
*

13:39.485 --> 13:42.389
(panting)

13:43.890 --> 13:45.491
That was...

13:45.524 --> 13:46.793
what was that?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.794
Oh, it's not here.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.364
It's not here.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.966
Okay, that's a little blacker

13:54.000 --> 13:55.368
than I like my arts.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.336
Oh, don't be such a wimp.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.506
That-that wasn't just
some temporal fold,

14:00.539 --> 14:02.341
that was some weird hell place.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.211
I don't think you're
telling me everything.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.648
I swear, I am just trying
to find my necklace.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.717
Well, did you try looking inside
the sofa in hell?

14:11.750 --> 14:14.821
Look, we'll just
try it again, and...

14:14.854 --> 14:17.690
No. I-I think
emphatically not.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.491
I can't do it
by myself.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.726
That's a relief.

14:20.759 --> 14:21.995
I'm out of here.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.096
Fine. Go.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.398
Idiot child.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.601
I believe these
chicken feet are mine.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.337
Look...

14:31.370 --> 14:34.173
magic is dangerous, Anya.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.543
It's-it's not to be toyed with.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.177
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:38.211 --> 14:39.812
I have someone else's
homework to do.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.719
Nothing!

14:55.261 --> 14:57.663
This is weird.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.304
*

15:06.905 --> 15:09.109
(laughing)

15:09.142 --> 15:11.910
KID: You're it!
KID 2: I'll race you!

15:11.945 --> 15:14.346
(happy, indistinct chatter)

15:16.783 --> 15:17.985
MAN:
What time does it start?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.286
Yeah, yeah?

15:19.318 --> 15:21.620
(chatter, laughter continues)

15:28.860 --> 15:31.130
(playful shrieking)

15:31.163 --> 15:32.399
(laughing)

15:32.432 --> 15:33.665
Come on.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.105
Excuse me, young lady...
(snarls)

15:38.138 --> 15:40.206
Oh... oh...

15:41.707 --> 15:44.344
(mellow song playing)

15:44.376 --> 15:47.980
* There's a chair in my head

15:48.014 --> 15:50.850
* On which I used to sit

15:50.883 --> 15:54.453
* Took a pencil and I wrote

15:54.486 --> 15:57.456
* The following on it

15:57.490 --> 16:00.826
* Now there's a key

16:00.860 --> 16:04.797
* Where my wonderful mouth
used to be *

16:08.034 --> 16:11.837
* Dig it up
and throw it at me *

16:11.870 --> 16:14.974
* Dig it up and
throw it at me *

16:15.008 --> 16:17.277
(pool balls clatter)

16:17.309 --> 16:19.946
* Where can I run to

16:19.979 --> 16:23.149
* Where can I hide

16:23.182 --> 16:26.153
* Who will I turn to

16:26.186 --> 16:30.289
* Now I'm in
a virgin state of mind *

16:30.322 --> 16:33.125
* Got a knife to disengage

16:33.159 --> 16:35.394
* The voids that I can't bear

16:35.427 --> 16:37.496
* Cutout words

16:37.529 --> 16:39.331
* I've got written

16:39.365 --> 16:42.302
* On my chair

16:42.335 --> 16:46.139
* Like:
do you think I'm sexy *

16:46.173 --> 16:48.575
* And do you think I really...
Hey.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.643
Rosenberg?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.245
What are you doing,
trick-or-treating?

16:52.278 --> 16:55.514
You're supposed to be at home
doing my history report.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.017
I flunk that class, you're
in big trouble with Snyder.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.519
Till we graduate,

17:00.552 --> 17:02.389
I own your ass.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.691
Bored now.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.759
(patrons exclaiming)

17:06.791 --> 17:08.827
What the heck?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.798
I'm having
a terrible night.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.905
Want to make it better?

17:25.978 --> 17:28.948
What's going on?
Is there a funny thing?

17:31.084 --> 17:32.285
Back off.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.552
You stay the hell
away from her.

17:33.586 --> 17:37.257
Okay. Sure.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.626
Xander...

17:40.660 --> 17:42.461
Will. Changing the look,

17:42.494 --> 17:43.895
not an idle threat
with you.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.732
You're alive.

17:49.301 --> 17:50.970
Uh...

17:51.002 --> 17:54.106
Will, this is verging on
naughty touching here.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.041
Don't want to fall
back on bad habits.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.278
Hands! Hands in new places.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.079
You're alive.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.584
You mentioned that before.

18:04.616 --> 18:05.817
Will, are you okay?

18:05.852 --> 18:08.086
No.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.390
Everything's different.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.824
There you are.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.292
Hey, Buff.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.727
Aren't you gonna
introduce me to your...

18:14.760 --> 18:17.297
Holy God, you're Willow.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.266
You...

18:19.298 --> 18:22.634
You know what?
I-I like the look.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.837
It's, um, it's extreme,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.340
but it-it looks good,
you know?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.675
It's a leather thing.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.411
And, uh...

18:31.443 --> 18:34.646
I said "extreme" already, right?

18:37.884 --> 18:40.452
I don't like you.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.789
Will, I'm sorry about today.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.125
You know how my foot
likes to live in my mouth,

18:46.159 --> 18:47.660
but you know,

18:47.693 --> 18:49.996
you really didn't have
to prove anything.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.266
Leaving now.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.968
Will, gotta say,
not loving the new you.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.203
Will, wait...

18:57.237 --> 18:58.805
Get off me.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.873
(snarling)

19:05.711 --> 19:07.713
*

19:15.488 --> 19:17.523
Willow Rosenberg.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.192
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.493
Then we won't talk.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.897
(snarling, grunting)

19:37.509 --> 19:39.144
You made me cranky.

19:39.177 --> 19:42.181
There's been
a mistake here.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.583
We were sent after a human.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.652
Really?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.153
Who do you work for?

19:47.185 --> 19:48.688
I'm not telling you
a thing.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.090
(bones snapping)

19:52.124 --> 19:53.092
(screams)

19:55.060 --> 19:56.596
Who do you work for?

19:56.628 --> 19:58.265
Wilkins.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.699
The Mayor.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.237
(bones snapping)
(screams)

20:05.372 --> 20:07.773
Who do you work for?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.778
You.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.847
Get your friends.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.017
Bring them here.

20:18.049 --> 20:19.586
The world's no fun anymore.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.557
We're gonna make it
the way it was...

20:24.590 --> 20:27.759
starting with the Bronze.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.564
GILES:
Oh, Buffy.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.266
I thought you
were going out tonight.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.567
I didn't expect...

20:38.770 --> 20:40.507
What is it?

20:43.675 --> 20:45.912
This isn't real.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.915
I can't feel
anything.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.619
Arms, legs, anything.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.955
She was truly...

20:56.989 --> 20:59.358
the finest
of all of us.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.362
Way better than me.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.265
Much, much better.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.468
XANDER:
But it's all my fault.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.637
No, it's me.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.271
I-It's me.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.474
I'm the one that
called her reliable.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.143
She must have gone out
and gotten attacked,

21:17.175 --> 21:18.577
which she never
would have done

21:18.611 --> 21:21.247
if I hadn't have
called her reliable.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.615
And now my best friend is...

21:22.648 --> 21:24.016
What's going on?

21:25.617 --> 21:26.818
Jeez, who died?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.856
Oh, God. Who died?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.625
Back!

21:32.659 --> 21:33.960
Get back, demon!

21:39.898 --> 21:42.201
Willow, you're alive.

21:42.233 --> 21:43.970
Aren't I usually?

21:45.404 --> 21:46.673
Oh!

21:51.411 --> 21:52.878
I love you guys, too.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.415
Okay. Oxygen becoming
an issue.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.320
Giles, what's going on
with these...

22:02.355 --> 22:03.823
(grunts)

22:03.855 --> 22:06.858
Oh. Uh... Sorry. Um...

22:09.028 --> 22:12.699
It's really nice that
you guys missed me.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.666
Say, you all didn't
happen to do

22:14.701 --> 22:17.036
a bunch of drugs,
did you?

22:17.068 --> 22:19.238
Will, we saw you
at the Bronze.

22:19.270 --> 22:20.507
A vampire.

22:20.539 --> 22:23.375
I'm not a vampire.

22:23.410 --> 22:27.747
You are. I mean,
you-you-you were.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.080
Giles, planning on
jumping in

22:29.115 --> 22:31.317
with an explanation
any time soon?

22:31.349 --> 22:32.818
Well, uh... something...

22:32.852 --> 22:37.423
something, um,
very strange is happening.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.426
Can you believe
the watcher's council
let this guy go?

22:40.460 --> 22:43.328
*

22:43.362 --> 22:45.765
(sighs)

22:47.365 --> 22:49.501
What a day.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.903
Give me a beer.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.704
I.D.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.608
I.D.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.877
I'm 1,120 years old!

22:58.911 --> 23:00.547
Just give me a frickin' beer!

23:00.579 --> 23:03.048
I.D.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.384
(sighs)
Give me a Coke.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.355
Man, we need
a roadie.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.757
Other bands
have roadies.

23:10.789 --> 23:13.125
Well, other bands
know more than three chords.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.561
Your professional bands
can play up to six,

23:15.595 --> 23:17.430
sometimes seven completely
different chords.

23:17.463 --> 23:20.365
That's just, like,
fruity jazz bands.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.933
Oz.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.435
Hey, man.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.371
You looking for Buffy?
As always.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.640
Well, no sightings
as of yet,

23:27.673 --> 23:29.107
but I think she
said she'd show.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.080
(patrons gasp, shriek)

23:37.950 --> 23:39.384
Ah! (grunts)

23:39.417 --> 23:41.252
That doesn't look good.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.689
Everybody, shut up!

23:45.458 --> 23:47.460
All right.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.929
Nobody cause any trouble
or try to leave...

23:51.430 --> 23:53.164
...and nobody gets hurt.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.933
Why don't I believe him?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.769
Well, he lacks
credibility.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.172
(snarls)

24:00.205 --> 24:02.173
Can you get
out of here?

24:02.208 --> 24:03.442
Skylight in the roof.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.811
I can make it.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.646
I think we need
some backup.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.448
I think I'm needed here.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.483
Ten to one.
Could get pointless.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.222
*

24:29.201 --> 24:30.469
Hmm...

24:32.739 --> 24:34.306
Look.

24:34.339 --> 24:36.875
Everyone's all afraid.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.411
It's just like old times.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.517
Get Buffy.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.817
Do it now.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.826
Dude, check out
your girlfriend.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.671
What's your name?

25:04.703 --> 25:06.838
Sandy.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.815
You don't have
to be afraid...

25:15.847 --> 25:18.116
just to please me.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.020
If you're all good
boys and girls,

25:22.054 --> 25:24.056
we'll make you young

25:24.089 --> 25:28.827
and strong,
forever and ever.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.128
We'll have fun.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.903
If you're not...

25:40.138 --> 25:41.941
(patron gasp, scream)

25:49.248 --> 25:52.550
Questions? Comments?

25:52.585 --> 25:53.451
Willow.

25:55.386 --> 25:56.888
You don't want to do this.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.891
I don't?

25:58.924 --> 26:01.760
But I'm so good at it.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.432
Who did this to you?

26:07.465 --> 26:09.801
I know you.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.537
You're a white hat.

26:11.569 --> 26:15.307
How come you're talking
to me like we're friends?

26:15.340 --> 26:18.744
'Cause he thinks
you're someone else.

26:18.778 --> 26:22.413
He thinks you're the Willow
that belongs in this reality.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.282
Another me?

26:24.316 --> 26:25.917
You know this isn't
your world, right?

26:25.951 --> 26:27.419
I mean, you know you
don't belong here.

26:27.452 --> 26:30.923
VAMP WILLOW:
No. This is a dumb world.

26:30.957 --> 26:34.894
In my world,
there are people in chains,

26:34.926 --> 26:37.363
and we can ride them
like ponies.

26:38.463 --> 26:39.766
You want to get back there.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.768
Yeah.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.970
So do I.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.440
This is creepy.

26:48.473 --> 26:50.241
I don't like
the thought

26:50.276 --> 26:52.443
that there's a vampire out
there that looks like me.

26:52.478 --> 26:53.746
Not looks like... is.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.749
It was exactly you,
Will, every detail.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.451
Except for your not
being a dominatrix...

26:59.484 --> 27:00.686
as far as we know.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.621
Oh, right. Me and Oz

27:02.654 --> 27:04.824
play Mistress of Pain
every night.

27:05.857 --> 27:07.492
Did anyone else
just go to

27:07.526 --> 27:09.494
a scary visual place?
Oh, yeah.

27:13.531 --> 27:16.803
Buffy, I...

27:16.836 --> 27:18.237
Look, something's
happened that...

27:21.507 --> 27:22.741
Willow's dead.

27:25.678 --> 27:26.913
Hey, Willow.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.317
Wait a second...

27:33.184 --> 27:34.385
We're right there
with you, buddy.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.855
We saw her, too.
At the Bronze.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.290
Okay.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.893
She's there now,
with a cadre of vampires

27:40.926 --> 27:42.161
looking to party.

27:42.193 --> 27:44.496
We can figure out
who she is

27:44.529 --> 27:46.231
after we stop
the feeding frenzy.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.233
How many of them
were there?
Eight or ten.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.634
Should we
call Faith?

27:49.667 --> 27:51.037
No, I don't want her
in combat yet.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.304
Not around
civilians.
Hear, hear.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.538
Guys?

27:53.572 --> 27:55.673
What are we gonna
do with me?

27:55.708 --> 27:58.410
The other me?

28:01.881 --> 28:03.548
I don't know, Will.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.416
I mean, we just have
to stop them.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.752
I-I get that.

28:06.786 --> 28:09.555
I just kind of
wanted to know...

28:09.587 --> 28:11.557
Oh. Hey. Uh, go.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.025
I'll catch up.

28:21.567 --> 28:24.470
Alone at last.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.247
Well, look at me.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.415
I'm all fuzzy.

28:39.117 --> 28:40.920
What do I want with you?
Uh...

28:40.952 --> 28:42.888
Your little school
friend Anya said

28:42.922 --> 28:44.556
that you're the one
that brought me here.

28:46.258 --> 28:49.394
She said that you could
get me back to my world.

28:49.427 --> 28:51.130
Oh.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.065
Oh. Oops.

28:53.098 --> 28:56.367
But I don't know...

28:56.402 --> 28:59.238
I kind of like the idea
of the two of us.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.476
We could be quite a team,

29:04.509 --> 29:06.644
if you came around
to my way of thinking.

29:06.678 --> 29:09.781
Would that mean
we have to snuggle?

29:11.017 --> 29:13.352
What do you say?

29:17.155 --> 29:20.092
Want to be bad?

29:20.125 --> 29:22.228
This just can't get
more disturbing.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.461
(growls)

29:23.494 --> 29:25.596
Ack! Ugh! No more.

29:25.631 --> 29:28.433
You're really starting
to freak me out.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.138
(growls, hisses)

29:35.307 --> 29:37.242
Ow...

29:37.276 --> 29:39.744
You don't want to play,

29:39.778 --> 29:41.012
guess I can't
force you.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.883
Oh, wait.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.785
I can.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.720
(grunts)

29:50.521 --> 29:51.789
Bitch.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.000
It's extraordinary.

30:01.032 --> 30:02.433
It's horrible.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.336
That's me as a vampire?

30:04.369 --> 30:05.671
I'm so evil,

30:05.703 --> 30:07.673
and skanky.

30:07.705 --> 30:09.641
And I think
I'm kind of gay.

30:09.674 --> 30:12.644
Willow, just remember,
a vampire's personality

30:12.678 --> 30:15.114
has nothing to do
with the person it was.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.082
Well, actually...

30:17.215 --> 30:19.351
That's a good point.

30:19.384 --> 30:22.788
So, uh, what do we do now?
Well, we still have
to get to the Bronze.

30:22.820 --> 30:23.855
ANGEL:
Even if they're supposed
to wait for her,

30:23.890 --> 30:25.057
they may start feeding.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.325
Vampires are not
notoriously reliable.

30:26.357 --> 30:28.727
So we charge in,

30:28.759 --> 30:30.162
much in the style
of John Wayne?

30:30.195 --> 30:32.830
High casualty risk.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.333
I haven't
any other plan, though.

30:34.365 --> 30:38.269
Uh... I have a
really bad idea.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.377
They're still in
a holding pattern.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.980
That's good.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.381
It means they must really
be afraid of you.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.717
Who wouldn't be?

30:53.184 --> 30:55.020
Are you okay
in that?

30:55.054 --> 30:56.989
It's a little binding.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.058
I guess vampires really
don't have to breathe.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.061
Gosh, look at those.

31:03.095 --> 31:06.898
Um, Willow, you-you,
uh, you go in

31:06.932 --> 31:08.834
and defuse the situation
as best you can.

31:08.866 --> 31:10.769
At least try and get
some of them to come out

31:10.801 --> 31:13.038
and even up
the odds a bit.

31:13.071 --> 31:14.673
First sign of trouble,
you give us a signal.

31:14.705 --> 31:16.174
We come in hard and fast.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.509
What is the signal?

31:17.542 --> 31:18.676
Me screaming.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.112
ANGEL:
Giles, you and Xander

31:20.145 --> 31:21.380
wait by the back entrance.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.214
Good.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.183
Now, you're sure
you're up to this?
Don't worry.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.718
I won't do anything

31:26.751 --> 31:27.953
that could be
interpreted as brave.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.654
We'll be right outside.

31:50.808 --> 31:52.077
Hi. I'm back.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.020
Did you find the girl?

32:04.089 --> 32:05.991
Yep. I did.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.625
Where is she?

32:09.595 --> 32:10.929
I killed her.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.565
And sucked her blood,

32:13.598 --> 32:17.269
as we vampires do.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.810
You know, I think maybe
I heard something out there.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.980
Why don't you go check?

32:36.954 --> 32:38.957
ANYA:
How could you kill her?

32:38.990 --> 32:41.759
She was our best shot
at getting your world back.

32:41.792 --> 32:46.298
I don't like that you
dare question me.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.134
Maybe I'll have
my minions

32:48.166 --> 32:50.568
take you out back
and kill you horribly.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.939
ANYA:
Vampires.

32:53.971 --> 32:55.840
Always thinking with your teeth.

32:55.874 --> 32:57.276
She bothered me.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.478
She's so weak
and accommodating.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.151
She's always letting people
walk all over her,

33:05.183 --> 33:08.186
and then she gets cranky
with her friends for no reason.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.655
I just couldn't let her live.

33:12.423 --> 33:14.792
You know, he's been gone
for a while.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.827
Why don't you
go check on him?

33:18.329 --> 33:22.667
Well, boss, since
that plan is out,

33:22.701 --> 33:25.436
why don't we get
with the killing?

33:27.105 --> 33:29.107
*

33:43.122 --> 33:46.092
Oh, this is
like a nightmare.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.927
Hello? Giles?

33:52.029 --> 33:53.664
Wesley?

33:53.699 --> 33:57.736
I just happened
to stop by...

33:57.769 --> 33:59.637
for books.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.441
Hey, you.

34:02.473 --> 34:05.243
Hey me?

34:05.277 --> 34:06.577
Hey me what?

34:06.612 --> 34:09.215
I have a name, you know.

34:09.248 --> 34:12.384
Uh, Cordelia.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.420
What did you do?

34:14.452 --> 34:16.422
Lock yourself in the book cage?

34:16.454 --> 34:17.922
Yeah.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.126
Let me out...

34:21.159 --> 34:24.195
'cause I'm so helpless.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.896
Okay.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.967
I think Giles
keeps a spare.

34:30.001 --> 34:33.871
How'd you manage to lock
yourself in, anyway?

34:33.905 --> 34:36.306
Uh, I was looking at books.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.244
I like books...

34:39.811 --> 34:41.045
'Cause I'm shy.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.614
Yeah, right.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.217
The famous "shy girl" act
all the boys fall for.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.518
Open the cage.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.393
Wait.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.262
It occurs to me that
we've never really had

34:57.295 --> 34:59.398
the opportunity to talk--

34:59.431 --> 35:01.333
you know, woman to woman--

35:01.367 --> 35:02.768
with you locked up.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.735
Don't want to talk.
Hungry.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.472
(exhales)

35:06.505 --> 35:08.407
What could we talk about?
(gasps)

35:08.440 --> 35:12.677
Hey! How about the ethics
of boyfriend stealing?

35:14.646 --> 35:17.282
I-I don't know if I feel
like killing anymore.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.318
I'm so bored.

35:20.351 --> 35:21.619
(sighs)

35:25.856 --> 35:29.494
It would be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

35:29.527 --> 35:31.463
Where's the fun?

35:31.496 --> 35:33.298
With all due
respect, boss,

35:33.331 --> 35:35.900
the fun would be
the eating.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.871
Maybe we should let everyone go

35:39.905 --> 35:42.173
and give them
a 30-second head start.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.942
Wait a minute.

35:43.974 --> 35:47.112
No! I like my plan.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.880
Oh, nice try.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.349
Okay, let's get
to the killing.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.117
Why don't we start with her?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.052
Why don't we start with you?
If she's a vampire,

35:54.085 --> 35:56.422
then I'm the creature
from the Black Lagoon.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.057
CORDELIA:
And, okay...

36:00.090 --> 36:02.126
It isn't even like I was
that attracted to Xander.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.894
It was more just
that we kept being

36:03.929 --> 36:06.532
put in these
life or death situations,

36:06.565 --> 36:09.166
and that's always
all sexy and stuff.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.038
I mean, I more or less
knew he was a loser,

36:13.070 --> 36:16.041
but that doesn't
make it okay

36:16.074 --> 36:18.744
for you to come
around and... what?

36:20.445 --> 36:22.179
Do I have something on my neck?

36:22.213 --> 36:23.581
Not yet.

36:23.614 --> 36:26.150
Am I getting a zit? Ugh...

36:26.184 --> 36:29.688
Cordelia, I'm very sorry.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.490
I realize I was wrong.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.193
I'll never steal
your boyfriend again.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.563
Like you could.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.764
I should just
leave you in there,

36:39.797 --> 36:41.532
but I'm a great humanitarian,

36:41.567 --> 36:44.168
and you will just have
to think of a way

36:44.202 --> 36:46.605
to pay me back sometime.

36:49.307 --> 36:50.541
Okay.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.978
How about dinner?

36:58.916 --> 37:01.286
(screaming)

37:05.590 --> 37:07.393
I didn't mean all that
stuff I said before.

37:07.425 --> 37:09.527
I want you to have Xander.
My blessings on you both.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.465
I'm so over him.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.601
I need fresh blood.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.469
(screams)

37:17.503 --> 37:19.304
(Cordelia screams)

37:26.777 --> 37:28.146
No more hiding.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.916
Back! Creature of the night.
(snarls)

37:31.949 --> 37:33.918
Leave this place!

37:33.952 --> 37:35.987
Don't wanna.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.193
(sighs) Whatever.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.503
(yelps)

37:52.538 --> 37:54.606
I'm sorry.

37:54.639 --> 37:56.942
No. No, no, no.
(chuckles)

37:56.974 --> 37:58.344
A little on edge.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.612
You know, men in combat.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.112
(fake growls)

38:02.146 --> 38:03.481
Are you all right?

38:03.514 --> 38:05.483
You saved my life.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.152
Thank you.

38:07.184 --> 38:10.889
Oh, yes. Uh... yes.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.293
Was that...?

38:16.327 --> 38:17.695
Willow.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.297
They got Willow.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.967
So, are you doing
anything tonight?

38:24.168 --> 38:25.637
ANYA:
I'm just so tired

38:25.670 --> 38:26.871
of being around human beings

38:26.905 --> 38:28.373
and all their baggage.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.641
I-I don't care if I
ever get my powers back.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.543
I think he should

38:32.577 --> 38:34.380
eat you.

38:34.413 --> 38:38.048
This girl has a history
of mental problems

38:38.083 --> 38:40.184
dating back to early childhood.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.019
I'm a blood-sucking fiend.

38:42.052 --> 38:43.288
Look at my outfit.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.623
VAMPIRE:
A human.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.057
I should have
smelled it right away.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.360
A human? Oh, yeah?

38:49.394 --> 38:50.728
Could a human do this?

38:50.762 --> 38:53.699
(screams piercingly)

38:53.731 --> 38:55.534
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.902
Humans do that.
Yeah.
I think, yeah.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.907
(chatter, vampires snarling)

39:04.876 --> 39:07.746
(grunting)

39:10.681 --> 39:11.717
(grunts)

39:11.750 --> 39:14.885
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Happy, but ow!

39:25.130 --> 39:26.130
Devon, come on!

39:31.969 --> 39:33.338
(grunting)

39:33.371 --> 39:34.940
No more snuggles?

39:37.742 --> 39:39.411
(shrieks)

39:53.891 --> 39:57.228
(grunting)

40:17.014 --> 40:18.315
(Willow choking)

40:36.166 --> 40:37.603
Buffy, no!

40:40.639 --> 40:42.608
GUY:
Yeah, is it over?

40:45.342 --> 40:47.612
Nice reflexes.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.481
Well, I work out.

40:52.349 --> 40:54.686
This world's no fun.

40:54.719 --> 40:57.155
You noticed that, too?

41:05.896 --> 41:08.534
So, um, in your reality,

41:08.567 --> 41:11.268
I'm, like, this
bad-ass vampire, huh?

41:11.302 --> 41:12.971
People afraid of me?

41:14.539 --> 41:16.340
Oh, yeah.

41:16.373 --> 41:18.175
I'm bad.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.949
I'm not sure about
releasing this thing
into the wild, Will.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.184
It is a demon.

41:26.217 --> 41:29.219
WILLOW:
I just can't kill her.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.356
No.

41:31.389 --> 41:33.358
Me, neither.

41:33.391 --> 41:36.226
I mean, I know
she's not me.

41:36.260 --> 41:40.465
We have a big nothing
in common, but still...

41:40.498 --> 41:42.432
There but for the grace
of getting bit.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.871
WILLOW:
We send her back
to her world,

41:45.903 --> 41:47.739
and she stands a chance.

41:47.773 --> 41:51.076
It's the way
it should be, anyway.

41:51.108 --> 41:52.844
Uh, we're about
ready here.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.885
GILES:
Don't you try any
tricks, now, dear.

42:00.918 --> 42:03.054
I don't need tricks.

42:03.088 --> 42:06.423
When I get my powers back,
you will all grovel before me.

42:06.456 --> 42:09.094
(both scoff)

42:09.126 --> 42:14.398
Yes, uh, if you, uh, Willows
would like to, uh,

42:14.431 --> 42:16.467
complete the circle...

42:17.534 --> 42:18.936
Good luck.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.373
Try not to kill people.

42:28.614 --> 42:30.447
Hands! Hands!

42:44.494 --> 42:46.463
(screaming)

42:49.934 --> 42:51.168
Aw...

42:53.838 --> 42:55.840
(indistinct chatter)

42:58.242 --> 43:00.311
Do you want to go out tonight?

43:00.344 --> 43:02.648
Strangely, I feel
like staying at home

43:02.681 --> 43:05.382
and doing my homework

43:05.416 --> 43:07.217
and flossing

43:07.251 --> 43:08.619
and dying a virgin.

43:08.653 --> 43:11.422
You know, you can
O.D. on virtue.

43:11.456 --> 43:15.960
Between me and my evil self,
I have double guilt coupons.

43:15.994 --> 43:19.831
I see now where the path
of vice leads.

43:19.864 --> 43:22.099
I mean, she messed up
everything she touched.

43:22.132 --> 43:24.534
I don't ever
want to be like that.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.304
Hey. Uh, hi.

43:27.338 --> 43:30.842
Oh, hi, listen,
I didn't have a chance...

43:30.876 --> 43:32.409
Okay, so I did
the outline

43:32.443 --> 43:34.846
for the paper
on Roosevelt.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.313
It turns out there were
two president Roosevelts,

43:36.347 --> 43:38.282
so I didn't know exactly
which one to do,

43:38.315 --> 43:39.985
so I did both.

43:40.018 --> 43:41.952
Um, and I know
they're kind of...

43:41.987 --> 43:44.422
kind of short, but, um,
I can flesh them out.

43:44.454 --> 43:46.657
Oh, and-and here's
the bibliography.

43:46.692 --> 43:49.494
Um, and I can retype
that if you want.

43:49.527 --> 43:52.097
You just let me know
what I did wrong,

43:52.130 --> 43:54.398
and I'll get on it.

44:04.208 --> 44:05.643
You want to go out tonight?

44:05.677 --> 44:07.077
9:00 sound good?

44:45.751 --> 44:48.219
Grr. Argh.
