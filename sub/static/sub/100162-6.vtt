01:07.320 --> 01:09.280
[man] In my capacity as Earl Marshal,

01:09.360 --> 01:11.800
I've always abided
by one guiding principle,

01:11.880 --> 01:15.000
which has served me extremely well
until now.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.680
[Wilson] Which is?

01:16.880 --> 01:19.760
[man] Wherever possible,
change absolutely nothing.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.920
Do things exactly the same way
as they were done before.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.360
In the case of Prince Charles's
investiture as Prince of Wales,

01:29.440 --> 01:34.080
I can see no reason
not to repeat in every detail

01:34.160 --> 01:39.080
the investiture of the previous
Prince of Wales in, uh, 1911.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.240
And to those of us
who've not had the opportunity...

01:42.320 --> 01:44.040
Or the interest, frankly.

01:44.360 --> 01:49.480
...to familiarize ourselves with
the details of the earlier investiture...

01:49.880 --> 01:52.120
[Adeane] A deployment of 15,000 troops,

01:52.960 --> 01:56.240
a Devonshire-class cruiser positioned
off the coast of Holyhead,

01:56.320 --> 02:00.560
21 gun salutes,
a battery of Royal Field Artillery,

02:00.640 --> 02:04.440
a landing party supplied
by the bluejackets and the Royal Marines,

02:04.520 --> 02:08.160
two squadrons of cavalry of the line,
a detachment of the...

02:08.240 --> 02:10.520
[Wilson] He went on and on. [coughs]

02:10.600 --> 02:13.920
And what he described
was less an investiture

02:14.000 --> 02:16.560
and more like an invasion! [chuckles]

02:19.960 --> 02:24.520
And the feeling is
we have a golden opportunity here

02:24.600 --> 02:28.120
to be more sensitive, inclusive,

02:28.480 --> 02:30.400
for the ceremony to feel...

02:31.600 --> 02:33.200
less like a feudal imposition,

02:33.280 --> 02:36.200
and more like the confirmation

02:36.280 --> 02:39.120
of a true native son of Wales.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.000
But my son isn't Welsh,
so gestures are all we have.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.280
But gestures can be powerful.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.080
What if he went there, studied there,

02:49.160 --> 02:54.680
learned enough Welsh to address
the country in their native tongue?

02:54.760 --> 02:59.000
Prince Charles is currently at Cambridge
and content there, finally,

02:59.440 --> 03:01.520
in his studies and his personal life.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.160
He likes acting.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.080
Acting?

03:08.120 --> 03:09.000
Yes.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.400
It's how he can express himself.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.160
It's a very delicate stage
in his development.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.640
I appreciate that.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.000
But we're in a very delicate stage
for the union too.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.960
The Security Service have been
picking up some murmurs, ma'am.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.360
Well, more than murmurs, actually.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.360
Growls.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.560
Separatist stirrings,
nationalist stirrings

03:35.640 --> 03:38.400
in a region that has long felt aggrieved,

03:38.520 --> 03:40.960
overlooked, undervalued.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.480
And the government's thinking was,

03:44.560 --> 03:48.640
why not pull him out of Cambridge
and send him to Wales?

03:49.680 --> 03:50.880
For a term.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.960
We think it could be enormously helpful.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.840
[Elizabeth] The government proposed,
and we agree,

04:03.920 --> 04:07.200
that you should spend a term at the
university there to learn the language.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.600
-But--
-No buts.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.120
But I'm really rather happy at Cambridge,

04:12.200 --> 04:15.160
not to mention I've just been cast
in a wonderful role.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.960
-I know, but--
-I thought no buts.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.400
But sometimes duty requires one
to put personal feelings...

04:22.480 --> 04:24.560
-And frivolity.
-...aside.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.680
Good. That's settled then.

-Come. Foxy, come here.

Why is she never like that with you?

04:45.560 --> 04:47.680
Vile and cold like that.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.120
Because I'm irrelevant.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.280
I rather wish
she would be like that with me.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.840
It would suggest I have significance.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.280
Trust me, you wouldn't like it in reality.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.360
I would.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.760
I'd bully her right back.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.400

Fancy being the heir?

We have a special visitor coming
to Aberystwyth this term to learn Welsh.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.440
His Royal Highness Prince Charles.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.040
And we'd like you to be his tutor.

Uh... [chuckles]

In case you've forgotten,
I'm the vice president of Plaid Cymru.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.760
I'm a republican nationalist.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.760
You know my feelings
about the office of the Prince of Wales,

09:23.840 --> 09:26.640
that it's a princehood
illegitimately imposed upon us

09:26.720 --> 09:29.880
by an oppressive imperial conquest.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.440
Aberystwyth...

09:34.840 --> 09:37.920
is the University of Wales.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.800
Our Welsh language department
is the finest in the land,

09:41.880 --> 09:45.160
and you its best and brightest teacher.

09:45.240 --> 09:50.080
Now, you claimed it was possible to learn
a considerable amount of Welsh

09:50.160 --> 09:52.440
in a relatively short period of time.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.640
That was for Welsh citizens.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.200
[Adeane] We were told
you had a certain technique.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.520
-Where else would he go?
-He can go to Fred Jarman in Cardiff.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.000
-No.
-He can go to Caerwyn Williams in Bangor.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.040
You can't make me do this.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.960
It would violate every belief in my body.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.280
[woman in Welsh] I don't understand.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.520
Welsh nationalism is the article of faith,
the shared belief

10:29.240 --> 10:34.680
that underpins our whole marriage.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.760
And now you elect to go
and serve the thing,

10:37.840 --> 10:40.880
the very thing, we have been fighting!

10:40.960 --> 10:44.160
[in Welsh] That was my first reaction too,
but think about it.

10:44.920 --> 10:49.400
The Labour government has actually
persuaded them to make the speech...

10:49.600 --> 10:50.880
in Welsh.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.000
Do you have any idea
how many people will see the broadcast?

10:56.080 --> 10:58.640
This could be a huge step
for our movement.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.440
[Millward] Hmm.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.440
I'm an educator.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.160
-Do you leave your politics at the door?
-No.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.480
My politics are the reason why
I walk through the door every day,

13:56.600 --> 13:58.320
and if I believe, and I do,

13:58.400 --> 14:01.400
that anyone deserves
a university education,

14:01.480 --> 14:04.680
then it would be hypocritical of me
not to extend that privilege

14:04.760 --> 14:07.520
to those at the very top,
as well as the bottom.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.280
But you don't approve of... me.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.280

I've nothing against you personally.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.080
But you wish my role didn't exist,
my family's.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.280
I don't think of myself as against things.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.720
I'm for things.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.040
For my country, my culture,

14:23.920 --> 14:26.360

14:26.680 --> 14:31.640
And you think that the Crown exists
in opposition to that.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.920
I think it imposes a kind of uniformity

14:34.000 --> 14:37.160
that by default, yes,
suppresses Welsh identity

14:37.240 --> 14:40.040

-[Charles] Hello.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.040
[door slams]

17:29.480 --> 17:31.200
[Charles] I miss Cambridge already.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.480
And this place is a bit... gloomy.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.600
[door closes]

17:35.680 --> 17:38.040
It's Wales. What do you expect? Hold on.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.680
-[loud music]
-Hold on.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.800
-[turns music down]
-Hold on, Charles.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.040
How are the other students?

17:49.440 --> 17:50.760
Short, hairy, and angry?

17:51.760 --> 17:54.280
-What?
-Isn't that what the Celts are like?

17:55.040 --> 17:58.320
Furry and furious,
big eyebrows, red faces,

17:58.400 --> 18:01.080
stooped under the weight
of an ancestral grudge?

18:01.160 --> 18:03.160
They're not very friendly, for sure.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.840
I passed a sign on the way in.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.880
"Welcome to Wales."

18:08.200 --> 18:10.560
Might as well have read,
"Bugger off back home."

18:10.760 --> 18:12.520
It's not for long.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.400
An eternity. Three months!

18:15.480 --> 18:16.640
It'll fly by.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.520
Crawl by more like, on hands and knees.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.840
You really are the most terrible Eeyore.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.280
[Charles sighs]

18:23.360 --> 18:24.800
What are we going to do with you?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.240
Getting me out of Wales might be a start.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.560
-I'll come and visit.
-No, you won't.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.760
No, you're probably right. I won't.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.800
-[chuckles]
-Chin up. Nobody likes a misery guts.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.240
[hangs up]

18:44.680 --> 18:45.760
[coin rattles]

18:46.280 --> 18:49.120
[Thomas]
And though he be but another student

18:49.200 --> 18:50.960
in the eyes of the faculty,

18:51.160 --> 18:54.760
I'm sure he'll forgive us
this more bespoke welcome

18:54.840 --> 18:56.560
to our university.

18:57.080 --> 19:02.680
And we hope this is the beginning
of a long and happy partnership,

19:02.760 --> 19:07.440
and perhaps, in time,
even his patronage as king.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.480
The Prince of Wales.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.560
-[all] The Prince of Wales.
-[Charles] Thank you. Thank you.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.600
[Parry clears throat]

19:20.160 --> 19:23.400
So, what do you think
of our facilities here, sir?

19:23.480 --> 19:27.200
It's, uh, quite the archive we have
in our library, don't you think?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.320
I confess I haven't actually made it
to the library yet. [chuckles]

19:32.400 --> 19:34.640
Not been to the library?

19:36.560 --> 19:40.440
I thought Mr. Millward was giving you
a full, rounded Welsh education.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.640
He is. I mean, I am.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.400
Uh, and like all students,
they're encouraged to...

19:47.080 --> 19:49.960
conduct extra reading off their own bats.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.880
Hmm. Ah.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.000
How is the speech going?

19:56.120 --> 19:59.200
You'll be channeling
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd himself

19:59.280 --> 20:01.080
before long, no doubt!

20:01.160 --> 20:02.800
[chuckling]

20:02.880 --> 20:03.920
I'm sorry, who?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
Llywelyn...

20:07.000 --> 20:09.560
Is he... an alumnus or...?

20:13.040 --> 20:14.760
We'll be covering that this week.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.960
-[Millward clears throat]
-[chuckles]

20:24.760 --> 20:26.760
-[knocking at door]
-[door opens]

20:26.840 --> 20:28.880
[Charles speaks in Welsh]
Good morning, teacher.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.000
[door closes]

20:32.920 --> 20:37.080
I've translated the opening of your speech
that the palace sent me.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.240
And? What did you think?

20:40.320 --> 20:42.040
I'm not here to pass judgment
on the content.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.960
You say whatever you like,
or whatever they tell you to.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.240
The hardest pronunciation for you
will be the word "atmosphere."

20:58.960 --> 21:00.120
Awyrgylch.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.520
It's like a verbal assault course

21:04.600 --> 21:08.400
of all your worst sounds scattered
one after another like traps.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.160
Break them up.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.080
So...

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
Ow-oo.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.520
Ar...

21:17.680 --> 21:18.560
Ow-oo.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.760
-Ah...
-Oo...

21:20.840 --> 21:21.720
Oo...

21:21.800 --> 21:24.320
-Glide into the "ooh."
-I'm trying to glide into it. Ow.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.480
Fine. Let's begin at the end.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.440
[rasps]

21:35.520 --> 21:36.920
Huh. [clears throat]

21:37.000 --> 21:38.040
[Millward rasps]

21:38.880 --> 21:40.160
[both rasp]

21:40.240 --> 21:41.280
Back of the throat.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.560
-Better.
-Hmm.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.280
I see, it's like the fricatives.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.200
-"Th," "ff," "sh," "ss" sounds.
-I know what fricatives are.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.800
We do them as warm-up exercises
before we go onstage.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.480
Hah, hay, hee, hay, hah,

21:53.560 --> 21:55.240
haw, hoo, haw, hah.

21:55.320 --> 21:59.480
Lah, lay, lee, lay, lah, law, loo.

21:59.560 --> 22:00.600
Or in Welsh...

22:00.680 --> 22:03.400
Lla, llay, llee, llay, llah, llaw.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.760
Do you get it?

22:05.680 --> 22:07.440
And the tongue twisters are my favorite.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.360
Uh, to sit in solemn silence
in a dull, dark dock.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.280
In a pestilential prison
with a lifelong lock

22:14.400 --> 22:16.800
Awaiting the sensation
of a short, sharp shock

22:16.880 --> 22:19.760
From a cheap and chippy chopper
on a big, black block.

22:20.280 --> 22:23.840
A tutor who tooted the flute
tried to teach two young tooters to toot.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.080
Said the two to the tutor,

22:25.160 --> 22:27.840
"Is it harder to toot or to teach
two young tooters to toot?"

22:27.920 --> 22:30.600
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two to two.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.160
A thing distinctly hard to say,
but a harder thing to do.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.960
For they'll beat a tattoo at two today,
a ratatatat tattoo.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.720
And the dragon will come
when he hears the drum,

22:37.800 --> 22:42.040
at a minute or two at two today,
at a minute or two today! [chuckles]

22:54.200 --> 22:55.440
[Millward sighs]

22:56.080 --> 22:57.120
[tuts]

22:57.440 --> 22:59.560
I understand
it's all a bit of fun for you.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.000
That was clear last night.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.920
"Where is the library?
Who is Llywelyn?"

23:09.160 --> 23:10.560
Do you have any idea

23:11.360 --> 23:13.680
how embarrassing that was
for the rest of us?

23:14.440 --> 23:15.880
How humiliating?

23:17.360 --> 23:18.560
The fact you didn't know?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.560
As your tutor,

23:29.400 --> 23:31.040
I'm going to ask you a favor.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.560
Pay us the respect.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.960
And give us just the slightest impression

23:40.040 --> 23:42.600
that you care about any of this

23:43.280 --> 23:44.680
before you turn around again,

23:44.760 --> 23:47.360
and never show up,
like the last Prince of Wales,

23:47.440 --> 23:48.600
and the one before him.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.200
[door opens]

24:01.560 --> 24:02.680
[door slams]

24:18.400 --> 24:20.960
[overlapping chatter]

24:26.440 --> 24:28.440
[indistinct whispering]

24:50.880 --> 24:52.880
[murmurs]

25:10.960 --> 25:13.000
[footsteps approach]

25:16.760 --> 25:17.880
What are you reading?

25:18.640 --> 25:20.400
The investiture speech for Charles.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.960
The Prime Minister thinks
it may be too dry, too rigid.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.200
And given that it is effectively
his introduction to the world,

25:27.280 --> 25:30.160
it might be an idea
to let Charles work on the speech himself.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.560
That it reflect him more.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.040
Do you think that's wise?

25:35.920 --> 25:40.840
That speech has been composed
by diplomatic and constitutional experts.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.960
Do you really want
Charles messing with that?

25:51.680 --> 25:54.920
I adapted my own maiden speech
to the Commonwealth aged 21.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
You remember.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.120
I do.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.960
You were in Cape Town.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.120
-After they separated us.
-Yes.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.280
Four endless months.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.720
Hoping you'd fall out of love with me.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.920
Fat chance.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.240
Anyway...

26:18.320 --> 26:19.560
that was you.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.520
This is Charles.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.760
A horse of a very different color.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.280
Yes.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.840
I... finally made it to the library.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.680
Now I know who Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.920
The first, and true, Prince of Wales.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.360
Given his title by the English
King Henry III...

27:19.520 --> 27:21.960
murdered a few years later
by Henry's son Edward.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.040
Edward I took the title
promised to Llywelyn,

27:25.120 --> 27:26.440
and conferred it on his own son

27:26.920 --> 27:29.000
at the gates of Caernarfon Castle.

27:29.960 --> 27:30.840
Hmm.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.080
The great betrayal.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.600
But the ancient hope still remains.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.200
A prophecy...

27:40.240 --> 27:45.160
that one day, a prince will be presented
from Eleanor's Gate atop Caernarfon

27:45.880 --> 27:50.760
and that he will be
a true Welsh-speaking son of Wales.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.240
I can't ever be a son of Wales...

27:55.440 --> 27:57.680
but I am working on
the Welsh-speaking part.

27:58.920 --> 27:59.920
Hmm.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.760
Good.

28:05.080 --> 28:08.000
Well, I should let you get on
with whatever it is

28:08.080 --> 28:10.720
a young prince, footloose and fancy-free,

28:10.800 --> 28:13.160
does of an evening away from home.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.680
Oh, yes. Well, I have, uh...

28:16.680 --> 28:18.520
I'll most likely just go back to my room.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.600
-Eat there.
-Alone?

28:22.120 --> 28:23.440
Have you not, uh...

28:24.880 --> 28:26.440
you know, made any...

28:26.520 --> 28:28.200
It's fine, really.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.000
I'm incredibly used to it.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.640
[in Welsh] They don't spend
much time together, thank God.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.720
[in English] Come in.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.920
[Mrs. Millward in Welsh] I don't know how
Tedi can even bear to be in the same room.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.760
[in English] Will you hold this, please?

28:48.400 --> 28:49.680
[Mrs. Millward in Welsh] Yes.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.000
Yes, of course.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.320
[in English] Go through.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.160
Mrs. Millward.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.200
[woman] Hello? Silvia?

29:24.320 --> 29:25.200
[Charles chuckles]

29:28.480 --> 29:30.400
[in Welsh]
What are you doing hiding there?

29:31.960 --> 29:33.440
What were you thinking?

29:33.760 --> 29:36.600
He has no friends. What was I supposed--

29:36.680 --> 29:40.160
You're not his friend, you're his tutor.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.120
He's just a kid, Silvia.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.840
Oh, my God.

29:45.640 --> 29:46.920
You like him.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.800
I don't like him.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.480
So what if I like him?

29:54.880 --> 29:55.920
Tri.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.280
-Pedwar.
-Pedwar.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.240
[Millward] Everything all right in here?

29:59.320 --> 30:00.720
We're nearly up to ten.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.400
He's a very good teacher.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.320
Nearly his bedtime.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.320
Aww.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.160
[Silvia in Welsh] Sleepy time, little man.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.480
-I don't want to.
-Na...

30:09.560 --> 30:11.960
No, but there's no choice, hmm?

30:12.040 --> 30:14.160
Mammy and I will come up
to say good night.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.520
Hmm? Come on.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.280
Hmm?

30:20.360 --> 30:24.520
[in Welsh] But I was teaching him Welsh.
[in English] Two, three, four.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.560
Dau, tri, pedwar.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.720
And you did such a great job.

30:29.120 --> 30:33.880
Next time, you can teach him
how to count to a hundred. Oh.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.200
-Say good night.
-Good night.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.280
[in English] Good night.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.200
[Millward in Welsh] You haven't been
teaching him naughty words?

30:45.280 --> 30:46.920
-No.
-[Silvia] Well, I hope not.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
[indistinct chatter in Welsh]

30:59.680 --> 31:03.040
Is that how you met? On a march?

31:03.120 --> 31:04.840
Hmm, hmm.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.200
Something like that.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.840
At a little town called Capel Celyn.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.680
I have so many places to visit.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.600
You wouldn't be able to visit anymore.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.960
It's underwater.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.640
Uh...

31:32.920 --> 31:34.480
The government drowned it.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.880
A new reservoir

31:40.760 --> 31:45.880
to provide drinking water
for Liverpool, England.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.640
And so one of the last fully
Welsh-speaking villages in the land

31:50.720 --> 31:53.120
now rests quietly at the bottom of a lake.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.280
No wonder you feel so strongly.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.640
And no wonder so many people want to...

32:04.720 --> 32:06.000
stop me.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.280
Revenge.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.320
I don't think it's revenge.
At least, it shouldn't be.

32:14.040 --> 32:17.000
What people really want
is self-determination.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.000
Not being spoken down to. Dominated.

32:21.160 --> 32:25.160
Governed by those so remote,
they don't even know you.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.760
Know who you are,
or what you think or need.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.080
Yes.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.160
I know how that feels.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.920
[Silvia in Welsh]
What do you think he meant by that?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.240
[Millward] I don't know.

33:06.360 --> 33:10.640
And when we took Andras to bed,
did you see the look on his face?

33:11.200 --> 33:12.200
Hmm.

33:13.640 --> 33:18.560
I don't think he's ever seen
a mother and father do that.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.600
Put their child to bed. Together.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.320
Hmm.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.520
How did he look?

33:30.120 --> 33:31.320
Shattered.

33:33.880 --> 33:34.880
See?

33:36.120 --> 33:38.320
You do feel sorry for him.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.440
Not sorry, no.

33:42.040 --> 33:45.480
-So what if I did feel sorry for him?
-[chuckling]

33:55.000 --> 33:57.080
[birds call]

34:15.360 --> 34:19.000
[Charles speaks Welsh]

34:22.320 --> 34:24.680
[speaks Welsh]

34:38.040 --> 34:39.040
Hmm.

34:40.280 --> 34:43.160
[in English] Remember not to rush through
your "atmosphere."

34:43.240 --> 34:44.360
Awyrgylch.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.080
-Awyrgylch.
-Awyrgylch.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.520
They kindly sent me an invitation
to attend the investiture.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.840
I must tell you, there are certain things
I draw the line at.

34:54.920 --> 34:55.920
[chuckles]

34:56.000 --> 34:58.720
-I still have my beliefs.
-Of course.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.080
[Charles] There is just one other thing.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.280
My speech

35:11.920 --> 35:14.240
was written for me by people
who don't know me.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.680
So, of course, it doesn't reflect
who I actually am or what I think,

35:18.120 --> 35:21.280
or, indeed, what I have come to learn
having been here in Wales,

35:21.640 --> 35:25.280
and there are one or two tiny additions
I'd like to make in my own voice,

35:25.360 --> 35:27.320
which actually come from me.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.440
Like what?

35:30.480 --> 35:32.240
[Charles] I've written them in English.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.960
They'd need translating.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.440
Here.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.960
I'll take a look.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.360
[sighs]

36:25.560 --> 36:28.040
[indistinct chatter]

36:45.080 --> 36:48.280
[practices speech in Welsh]

36:53.480 --> 36:56.080
[speaks in Welsh]

37:01.600 --> 37:04.840
[commentator]
Good afternoon. This is the BBC.

37:05.440 --> 37:09.040
We welcome you here
to this royal principality of Wales,

37:09.320 --> 37:11.920
where eager crowds await the investiture

37:12.000 --> 37:13.560
of Prince Charles

37:13.840 --> 37:15.440
as Prince of Wales

37:15.840 --> 37:17.720
on this historic day.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.880
[knocking at door]

37:18.960 --> 37:20.000
[Charles] Yes.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.480
[door opens]

37:22.440 --> 37:23.440
[door closes]

37:29.840 --> 37:32.840
[Mountbatten] Come on then.
Can't keep your audience waiting.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.960
[commentator] Good morning to you,

37:37.040 --> 37:39.600
and bore da
from inside Caernarfon Castle

37:39.680 --> 37:43.200
where the preparations are now complete
for the arrival of Her Majesty

37:43.280 --> 37:47.480
and, of course, the young man
who will one day succeed her.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.760
It's a large turnout for the Prince today,

37:55.840 --> 38:00.760
and the mood among the gathering crowds
is one of anticipation, excitement,

38:00.840 --> 38:02.160
and, some might say,

38:02.640 --> 38:04.080
palpable tension.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.480
You're going to be fine.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.200
[door opens]

38:17.400 --> 38:18.600
[door closes]

38:31.840 --> 38:33.840
[crowd cheers]

38:38.400 --> 38:39.720
Charles! Charles!

38:46.920 --> 38:48.920
[booing]

38:51.200 --> 38:53.640
[commentator]
A good response from the onlookers.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.440
Only a few boos could be heard,

38:56.520 --> 39:00.080
and otherwise the Welsh people
showing enormous support.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.480
[applause]

39:15.680 --> 39:17.400
Two minutes, Your Royal Highness.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.520
[Charles] I, Charles...

40:17.840 --> 40:19.080
Prince of Wales...

40:20.280 --> 40:22.920
to become your liege man
of life and limb...

40:25.240 --> 40:26.800
and of earthly worship...

40:30.400 --> 40:31.400
and faith

40:31.480 --> 40:32.640
and truth,

40:32.720 --> 40:34.360
I will bear unto thee...

40:36.400 --> 40:39.280
to live and die
against all manner of folks.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.120
[in Welsh] It is with great pride...

40:55.280 --> 41:00.200
that I undertake this privilege today,

41:00.880 --> 41:04.360
in this historic location

41:05.600 --> 41:11.040
and in the spectacular fortress
we see around us.

41:12.080 --> 41:15.120
Truly, the...

41:17.880 --> 41:19.240
atmosphere...

41:20.280 --> 41:23.560
and the emotion is enough
to make a man tremble.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.880
It was a great honor...

41:45.960 --> 41:50.360
-[in Welsh] Shh! Keep the noise down!
-...to be welcomed to Wales...

41:51.840 --> 41:54.760
-and to have my eyes opened...
-Shh!

41:54.840 --> 41:57.280
...to the Welsh perspective.

41:57.920 --> 42:02.560
Wales has a history to be proud of,

42:03.200 --> 42:07.600
and it is completely understandable
that the Welsh

42:07.680 --> 42:11.440
wish to hold on to their heritage,
their native culture,

42:11.680 --> 42:14.520
their identity, their disposition

42:15.120 --> 42:18.000
and their personality as a nation.

42:20.760 --> 42:25.120
It is important we respect that.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.880
Wales has her own identity.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.120
Her own character.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.600
Her own will.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.240
Her own voice.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.280
[continues speech]

42:52.840 --> 42:54.840
[voice fades under background music]

43:15.200 --> 43:17.560
[music plays over dialogue]

43:31.200 --> 43:32.320
[Chares clears throat]

43:48.400 --> 43:49.520
[door opens]

43:51.120 --> 43:52.480
Ah, hello.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.200
Before I left,
I just wanted to say thank you.

43:55.480 --> 43:57.840
-For everything.
-Oh, pleasure.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.720
[in Welsh] Andras, look who's here.

44:00.920 --> 44:02.440
[in English] And to give you this.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.080
Oh, thank you.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.480
[in Welsh] How are you, Andras?

44:06.560 --> 44:08.400
Very good. Thank you, Charles.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.600
[in English] Very good.

44:09.960 --> 44:10.960
What now?

44:11.480 --> 44:13.240
Straight back to England?

44:13.320 --> 44:18.760
No, a four-day tour of Wales
to visit every town, shake every hand.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.920
And listen.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.600
Good for you.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.760
You've done well.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.080
I had a good teacher.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.000
[in Welsh] Stay here.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.120
Charles.

44:56.680 --> 44:58.160
[in English] Uh, I'm curious.

44:58.960 --> 45:02.680
How did the changes you made to the speech
go down with your family?

45:05.040 --> 45:07.400
Well, that's the beauty
of having done it in Welsh.

45:08.600 --> 45:11.120
They won't have understood a word
of what I actually said!

45:11.200 --> 45:12.520
[chuckles]

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
[in Welsh] Goodbye.

45:18.840 --> 45:19.840
[in Welsh] Goodbye.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.640
Goodbye, Andras!

45:23.720 --> 45:24.760
Goodbye!

45:28.840 --> 45:30.440
[engine starts]

45:34.520 --> 45:35.560
[car door shuts]

45:48.720 --> 45:49.800
[chuckles]

45:54.440 --> 45:56.960
[man] Well, I believe
congratulations are in order, sir.

45:57.040 --> 45:57.920
Thank you, Stephen.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.440
I saw it on the television.
You looked very, very dapper.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.400
-Grand, wasn't it?
-Yes.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.440
Now, sir, would you like a spot of supper?

46:04.920 --> 46:05.960
I...

46:11.120 --> 46:13.960
-Where's the Queen?
-Just retired for the night, sir.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.200
Stephen, might you ask if she'll see me?

46:19.040 --> 46:20.080
Very good, sir.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.040
[sighs]

46:33.920 --> 46:34.920
[exhales]

46:35.400 --> 46:38.560
Her Majesty hoped
it might wait until morning, sir.

46:38.640 --> 46:41.600
But if not,
she will see you briefly in her bedroom.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.640
[knocking at door]

46:47.920 --> 46:48.920
Come in.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.200
[door opens]

46:58.080 --> 46:59.680
[jewelry rattles]

47:05.600 --> 47:06.640
Is that it?

47:08.200 --> 47:09.800
Is that the welcoming committee?

47:12.160 --> 47:13.640
What more is to be said?

47:15.280 --> 47:18.640
How about, "Thank you," or, "Well done"?

47:19.440 --> 47:22.960
If we all had to thank one another
every time we did anything in this family,

47:23.040 --> 47:24.480
we'd never get anywhere.

47:32.960 --> 47:37.120
I've just been on a very challenging
post-investiture tour of Wales.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.000
It went better than anyone expected.

47:39.280 --> 47:40.280
Thank you.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.520
You were sent to Wales to show respect,

47:43.640 --> 47:46.720
and heal divisions,
not inflict them on your own family.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.720
I did nothing of the sort.

47:51.200 --> 47:54.800
I've had the opportunity now to read
the translation of what you actually said,

47:54.880 --> 47:56.280
and the inferences you made.

47:57.400 --> 48:00.400
The similarity between Wales's suffering
and yours was clear.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.600
-Was it?
-Unmistakable.

48:03.840 --> 48:04.920
Only to you.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.040
To all Wales, apparently.

48:12.840 --> 48:14.720
"If this union is to endure,

48:14.800 --> 48:17.880
then we must learn
to respect each other's differences.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.760
Nobody likes to be ignored,

48:19.840 --> 48:22.640
to not be seen or heard or listened to."

48:24.880 --> 48:26.120
Well, am I wrong?

48:27.000 --> 48:30.280
Isn't there a similarity
between my predicament and the Welsh?

48:31.320 --> 48:33.120
Am I listened to in this family?

48:34.080 --> 48:36.440
Am I seen for who and what I am? No.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.000
Do I have a voice?

48:38.080 --> 48:40.160
Rather too much of a voice for my liking.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.200
Not having a voice is something
all of us have to live with.

48:44.280 --> 48:47.400
We have all made sacrifices
and suppressed who we are.

48:47.480 --> 48:50.240
Some portion of our natural selves
is always lost.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.440
That is a choice.

48:52.440 --> 48:53.640
It is not a choice.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.720
It is a duty.

48:56.840 --> 48:59.880
I was a similar age to you
when your great-grandmother, Queen Mary,

48:59.960 --> 49:03.520
told me that to do nothing,
to say nothing, is the hardest job of all.

49:04.240 --> 49:07.000
It requires every ounce of energy
that we have.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.680
To be impartial is not natural,
it's not human.

49:11.800 --> 49:14.320
People will always want us
to smile or agree,

49:14.400 --> 49:16.120
or frown or speak,

49:16.760 --> 49:21.120
and the minute that we do, we will
have declared a position, a point of view,

49:21.200 --> 49:23.200
and that is the one thing
as the royal family

49:23.280 --> 49:25.360
we are not entitled to do.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.680
Which is why we have to hide
those feelings, keep them to ourselves.

49:30.680 --> 49:35.000
Because the less we do,
the less we say or speak or agree or--

49:35.080 --> 49:35.960
Or think...

49:37.840 --> 49:38.920
or breathe...

49:40.160 --> 49:41.880
or feel or exist.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
The better.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.320
But doing that is perhaps
not as easy for me as it is for you.

49:51.600 --> 49:54.760
-Why?
-Because I... have a beating heart.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.320
A character.

50:01.320 --> 50:03.040
A mind and a will of my own.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.000
I am not just a symbol.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.400
I can lead not just by wearing a uniform,
or by cutting a ribbon,

50:10.480 --> 50:13.040
but by showing people who I am.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.320
Mummy, I have a voice.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.800
Let me let you into a secret.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.200
No one wants to hear it.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.840
Are you talking about the country...

50:36.520 --> 50:37.800
or my own family?

50:40.040 --> 50:41.040
No one.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.680
[door closes]

51:10.400 --> 51:12.800
[Charles] For within the hollow crown

51:13.360 --> 51:16.080
rounds the mortal temples of a king

51:16.880 --> 51:18.760
keeps Death his court

51:19.440 --> 51:21.760
and there the antic sits,

51:22.480 --> 51:25.240
scoffing his state
and grinning at his pomp...

51:28.760 --> 51:30.400
allowing him a breath...

51:32.440 --> 51:34.480
a little scene to monarchize.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.640
Be fear'd and kill with looks...

51:46.280 --> 51:49.240
infusing him
with self and vain conceit...

51:51.440 --> 51:55.440
as if this flesh which walls about
our life, were brass impregnable...

51:58.640 --> 52:01.440
and humor'd thus comes at the last

52:01.520 --> 52:02.760
and with a little pin...

52:04.520 --> 52:06.640
bores through his castle wall,

52:07.240 --> 52:09.000
and farewell king!

52:16.440 --> 52:17.800
Cover your heads...

52:19.360 --> 52:21.120
and mock not flesh and blood

52:21.200 --> 52:22.560
with solemn reverence...

52:23.600 --> 52:25.000
throw away respect,

52:25.800 --> 52:26.760
tradition,

52:27.880 --> 52:29.880
form and ceremonious duty...

52:33.600 --> 52:36.120
for you have but mistook me all this while

52:39.320 --> 52:41.400
I live with bread like you,

52:44.040 --> 52:45.080
feel want...
