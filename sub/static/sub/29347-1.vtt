[Music playing]

02:32.848 --> 02:35.807
[reporter] Tonight,
some local businesses are yelling "Help!"

02:35.851 --> 02:37.940
After getting targeted on Yelp.

02:37.983 --> 02:41.073
A lot of business owners
say what Yelp is really doing

02:41.117 --> 02:43.641
is extorting them
for advertising money.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.731
One bad review can really,
like, destroy your business,

02:46.775 --> 02:48.080
you can lose
thousands of dollars.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.517
Consumer investigative
reporter,

02:49.560 --> 02:51.345
Harry Sandler,
wanted to speak with Yelp

02:51.388 --> 02:53.390
about its top reviewer
right here in Atlanta.

02:53.434 --> 02:57.133
And as it turns out,
that reviewer is actually a paid Yelp employee.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.789
[Reporter] Yelp would only give us an on-camera interview

03:00.832 --> 03:03.574
if we would agree to give the story a positive spin.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.837
We don't work that way.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.275
A Yelp spokesperson
says we are being unfair.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.928
Is Yelp good or evil?

03:11.930 --> 03:12.801
Let's take a look and see what the research has to say about the debate.

03:18.894 --> 03:22.637
[David Balto] Over 2,000 complaints were filed by businesses

03:22.680 --> 03:24.639
that their rankings
were diminished

03:24.682 --> 03:28.382
because they refused
to advertise with Yelp.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.560
My name's Adam Fisher,
I own Computers WTF.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.953
I manage
AAA Appliance Service Center.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.738
We're Gentle Giant
Moving Company.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.392
BCR-Propridge LLC.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.350
Pizzeria in Nashville
Tennessee.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.091
I own Belle Roche
Estate Jewelry,

03:42.134 --> 03:43.353
and I've been
extorted by Yelp.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.748
And I have been
extorted by Yelp and Yelpers.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.532
I was harassed by Yelp.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.055
I'm being exploited by Yelp.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.056
Extorted by Yelp.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.233
- Extorted and harassed...
- By Yelp.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.191
We have been extorted by Yelp.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.854
[Charlie Rose]
Jeremy Stoppelman is here,

04:05.897 --> 04:08.248
he is co-founder
and CEO of Yelp.

04:08.291 --> 04:12.121
It is a website and mobile app
dedicated to user reviews.

04:12.164 --> 04:16.168
Since its IPO in 2012,
Yelp stock price has soared.

04:16.212 --> 04:20.216
It now has a market capitalization of $3.2 billion.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.914
I'm pleased to have Jeremy Stoppelman at this table

04:22.958 --> 04:24.873
for the first time. Welcome.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.875
- Thanks for having me.
- Oh, boy, you, uh...

04:26.918 --> 04:28.137
Let's... I don't know
where to start.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.666
Tell me what Yelp does,
that's where we can start.

04:36.754 --> 04:39.975
Uh, one way to look at it is it's just word-of-mouth, amplified.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.238
You know, we set out
to create the new Yellow Pages,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.762
a better way
for finding local businesses.

04:44.806 --> 04:48.636
- And so, just like Wikipedia, it's open to all commerce.
- Right.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.333
Anyone can come onto the site,

04:50.377 --> 04:53.075
write a review of their favorite local business,

04:53.118 --> 04:55.773
and all of that local knowledge can then be searched over.

04:55.817 --> 04:59.299
And so,
you can find just about any business that you want.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.561
And, you know,
here in the States,

05:02.214 --> 05:03.215
just about any city,
and increasingly throughout the world,

05:04.913 --> 05:06.306
you can find the best local businesses by turning to Yelp.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.482
I use Yelp.

05:09.744 --> 05:10.658
[Woman] My friends and I
will get in a circle

05:11.876 --> 05:12.573
and talk about it
from the Yelp review,

05:13.661 --> 05:14.270
and then we'll choose
where we go.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.273
We usually try and find a restaurant based on Yelp reviews.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.188
Looking up food and places
and stuff like that.

05:19.623 --> 05:22.713
I go straight to...
First of all, the stars.

05:22.757 --> 05:26.674
If it has, like, two stars,
most likely I won't go to it.

05:26.717 --> 05:29.590
- Exactly. Exactly.
- Two stars. Like, whoa.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.680
I always use Yelp
to get any kind of service.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.555
I started at Yelp
in March of 2011.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.949
There was some kind of appeal,

05:40.992 --> 05:43.299
I just had to know
what was going on in there.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.564
Some kind of allure and romance to working at a big company like that,

05:47.608 --> 05:48.957
it seemed very exciting.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.874
There was a feeling that you had to be exceptional to work there.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.138
There was a feeling
you had to be really smart

05:56.181 --> 05:57.748
and talented.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.360
[Stoppelman] We've got
this wonderful feature

06:00.403 --> 06:01.361
for all of our top salespeople.

06:02.666 --> 06:03.406
So if you're a top salesperson
for the month,

06:04.712 --> 06:06.888
you get to go have
an incredible photo made.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.368
Uh, there's this place
in the Mission

06:10.065 --> 06:12.502
that specializes in, like,
quinceanera photography and, uh...

06:12.546 --> 06:15.549
So we send our top sales rep
over to that studio

06:15.592 --> 06:18.421
and then they come up with a costume
and a theme and an idea of their own.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.118
That is some
really good incentive

06:20.162 --> 06:22.469
to become a top salesperson,
is to get something like this.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.296
Everyone wants to be
on this wall, for sure.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.691
[Valentine]
Sales floor, it's like...

06:28.475 --> 06:30.651
Each team has a couple of pods,

06:30.912 --> 06:32.261
and it does feel
kind of like, you know,

06:32.304 --> 06:33.784
you're on the rowing team
or something,

06:35.569 --> 06:36.657
where you're definitely aware of, like,
"How's that team doing?"

06:36.700 --> 06:37.658
And there's even a board,

06:38.876 --> 06:40.182
you know, all the teams
and their number.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.097
Each team has a board

06:42.140 --> 06:44.447
and each rep
has their number up.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.928
So there's complete transparency,
the whole time,

06:46.971 --> 06:48.669
of how everybody's doing.

06:48.712 --> 06:52.020
And so you're naturally
going to want to show success.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.595
[Amy Lane] It was somewhere I would
go to get phone numbers and addresses,

07:01.638 --> 07:03.814
and business information,
so I thought it kind of worked.

07:03.858 --> 07:04.902
Just like the Yellow Pages,

07:06.295 --> 07:07.470
and maybe it was set up
by the city or something,

07:07.514 --> 07:09.298
but then, it's not.

07:09.341 --> 07:12.736
It's a private corporation
that has a business model

07:12.780 --> 07:16.174
and their business model
affects everybody.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.350
Whether you want
to be on Yelp

07:18.394 --> 07:19.917
or whether you don't
want to be on Yelp,

07:21.789 --> 07:22.833
whether people know you're on Yelp or not,
you're gonna be on there.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.314
Yelp always controls
the narrative.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.972
[Indistinct chatter]

07:32.147 --> 07:33.409
My name is Danny Teran

07:34.976 --> 07:36.456
and I am the owner-operator
of The Wheelhouse Brooklyn.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.807
I did not put myself on Yelp.

07:39.850 --> 07:43.593
One of the users and people
who came into our restaurant

07:43.637 --> 07:46.901
created an account for us
and started our account off

07:46.944 --> 07:50.078
with a nice five-star review
for their first experience.

07:51.688 --> 07:54.299
From then on, it was new
and it was fresh

07:54.343 --> 07:56.345
and people were really
enjoying theirselves

07:56.563 --> 07:59.304
and coming in here and leaving us positive reviews

07:59.348 --> 08:03.613
and we got all the way up
to about 35 five-star reviews.

08:05.572 --> 08:09.663
[Gabriel Vitol] I used Yelp as a consumer on and off for ten years,

08:09.706 --> 08:11.534
when I wanted to check out
a new restaurant

08:11.578 --> 08:13.231
or see a new place.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.453
But I was never
hardcore, like,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.455
elite Yelp user
or anything like that.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.979
As a consumer, if I saw
a negative Yelp review,

08:22.023 --> 08:23.764
it would absolutely
make me think twice

08:23.807 --> 08:26.897
about using those services
or buying that product.

08:29.073 --> 08:33.164
I came to California in 2012
to start a restaurant

08:33.207 --> 08:36.907
and I sacrificed so much and I left a lot behind at home.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.780
And I was the youngest woman
in San Diego

08:39.823 --> 08:41.695
to have a restaurant
and run it alone.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.393
This was the front patio
of my restaurant.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.438
So I had a huge
glass window...

08:46.482 --> 08:49.441
And I was just glad that
I was able to come here

08:49.485 --> 08:50.704
and start a business

08:50.747 --> 08:52.532
and I was really
proud of myself.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.623
I never imagined Yelp
would be the reason

08:56.666 --> 08:58.886
that I would close
my business.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.628
There's no accountability
for jobs being lost.

09:01.671 --> 09:05.022
There's no accountability
for first-time businesses

09:05.066 --> 09:07.024
who start up
and take out a huge loan

09:07.068 --> 09:08.548
and have everything crushed.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.464
[Alexander G. Chamandy] Really,
what got me interested in Yelp in general

09:12.508 --> 09:14.597
is just having
a mix of experiences,

09:14.641 --> 09:17.252
starting off with lots of positive feedback from customers.

09:20.081 --> 09:23.084
We started to hear from
these sales people in Yelp

09:23.127 --> 09:24.912
and they'd call us
several times a week

09:24.955 --> 09:27.131
and we'd, uh, basically
be given a pitch that,

09:27.175 --> 09:29.960
"Hey, you can spend anywhere
between $300, $500 a month.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.571
It'll improve
your visibility.

09:31.614 --> 09:32.789
You'll get all
of this traffic."

09:34.269 --> 09:35.313
And I would politely decline.
Uh, just basically say,

09:37.011 --> 09:37.794
"Look, we're a home-based business.
We're of modest means

09:39.013 --> 09:39.970
and we cannot afford that
in our budget."

09:44.192 --> 09:46.629
[Teran] So a sales representative from Yelp reached out to me

09:46.673 --> 09:49.850
about three months
into being a business.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.765
What they were explaining was

09:51.808 --> 09:55.507
we're getting X amount of
clicks on our Yelp page daily

09:55.551 --> 09:57.988
and that we should be,
kind of,

09:58.032 --> 10:00.382
paying for every single one
of those clicks.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.994
Yelp would call me
every couple of days

10:04.038 --> 10:07.607
and they'd try and sell me these ridiculous advertising packages.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.653
And they would keep me on the phone for 40 minutes or so,

10:10.697 --> 10:13.047
it was impossible to get
these guys off the phone.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.442
[Teran] So I listened to her pitch and after a week or so,
hearing her out,

10:17.486 --> 10:20.707
it seemed to be as if it would be like $500 or $600 a month.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.709
I let her know
it's out of my budget.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.493
It's not something
we can do right now.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.234
And she was very persistent

10:26.277 --> 10:29.672
and almost to a...
Like a harassing point

10:29.716 --> 10:32.283
where she just did not stop
calling me and e-mailing me

10:32.327 --> 10:33.633
and calling me
and e-mailing me.

10:33.894 --> 10:37.506
Telling me reasons why
we need that service.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.639
And realistically,
three months into the business,

10:39.856 --> 10:41.815
it wasn't in our budget
at the moment.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.646
My name is Davide Cerretini

10:46.689 --> 10:49.126
and I am one of
the chef-owners

10:49.170 --> 10:51.085
of Botto Bistro
in Richmond, California.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.959
Yelp, it started, like,
I think it was 2006.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.309
We'd jump on the wagon

10:58.353 --> 11:01.661
and, you know, we embraced
their idea like everybody else.

11:01.878 --> 11:06.404
Along those years, from 2006 to 2015,
many things have changed.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.449
Many things happened.

11:08.711 --> 11:09.930
It's a different story
from what it was before

11:09.973 --> 11:11.496
or what we expected it to be.

11:14.848 --> 11:18.068
Yelp started to harass us
around 2012.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.723
And I mean harass us.

11:20.767 --> 11:25.119
We were talking about seven
or eight, nine calls a week.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.121
And there is
no way to deny it

11:27.164 --> 11:30.515
because Yelp can go back
and look at their record,

11:30.559 --> 11:31.908
then they see that it's true.

11:32.735 --> 11:35.303
I pay them $270 a month

11:35.346 --> 11:37.087
to shut the fuck up.

11:39.742 --> 11:43.050
Okay, on behalf of Anton
who just got a deal,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.008
I'm ringing the bell for him.

11:46.270 --> 11:46.749
I feel like I'm taking
something from you.

11:48.098 --> 11:48.969
- [Anton speaking indistinctly]
- [man laughing]

11:50.057 --> 11:51.449
All right. All right.
Here we go.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.190
This is what it sounds like.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.062
- [Bell dinging]
- [clapping]

11:55.105 --> 11:56.933
- [all cheering]
- Yeah!

11:56.977 --> 11:58.021
[Chuckling]

11:59.501 --> 12:01.895
Yelp is impossible
to contact,

12:01.938 --> 12:04.201
so they call you

12:04.245 --> 12:06.247
when they have something
to sell you.

12:06.290 --> 12:09.032
[Teran] It wasn't till
after our conversation

12:09.076 --> 12:10.817
and me denying their service

12:10.860 --> 12:12.601
that everything happened
to my account.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.088
[Reporter] A busy time
at the post of Yelp,

12:21.131 --> 12:23.220
the latest hot market debut.

12:23.264 --> 12:26.310
The consumer review website
came to market late Thursday

12:26.354 --> 12:29.749
at a higher than anticipated
price of $15 a share.

12:30.010 --> 12:33.448
The share price climbed
as high as $26 a share

12:33.491 --> 12:36.103
before backing off
that opening high.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.148
It was... It was
a great IPO, I think.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.802
Everybody wins
in that situation.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.762
Investors were happy.
Employees were excited.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.982
The day of IPO came

12:46.026 --> 12:48.463
and it was this big, like,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.987
wow, you know,
and celebration and...

12:52.989 --> 12:56.384
Then, after that, I felt
my experience was,

12:56.427 --> 12:59.779
maybe, a dark cloud
passed over the land.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.826
And going forward,
it did feel a lot more like

13:03.870 --> 13:05.697
our intentions
are different now

13:05.741 --> 13:08.744
and we're answering
to different people.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.180
You know, stockholders.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.095
And, um, it's a different...

13:12.139 --> 13:14.532
It's a game changer
once you go IPO.

13:14.576 --> 13:18.885
Yeah, it's definitely "Now,
we're in the capitalist world."

13:24.064 --> 13:26.066
[Chamandy] Every time
we'd get those calls,

13:26.109 --> 13:28.024
I would get more
and more nervous.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.548
That when the phone was ringing and it was a 415 area code,

13:30.592 --> 13:31.375
it was likely Yelp.

13:32.333 --> 13:32.899
That this was
gonna be a call

13:34.074 --> 13:34.465
that might harm
my business's reputation

13:35.423 --> 13:35.989
if I don't say
the right words.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.080
[Teran] It got to a point
where I said to her, "Stop.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.647
I can't do this. I'm sorry."

13:42.691 --> 13:44.432
You know, "Leave me alone,"
in a sense.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.130
The day after I created
my profile,

13:47.174 --> 13:49.480
I started getting hounded
by sales people.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.222
They just called
every single day

13:52.266 --> 13:54.050
making me
all kinds of promises.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.009
Yelp sales people
called me

13:56.052 --> 13:58.185
approximately three
to five times a week.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.143
Until I finally gave in.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.800
That feeling of
winning is really,

14:04.844 --> 14:06.933
uh, satisfying in some
kind of way.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.065
You know,
that you won somehow

14:09.109 --> 14:11.415
and you get to ring this gong

14:11.459 --> 14:13.853
on the floor and get to be
famous for a second.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.250
[Woman] Each time a Yelp user
views your business page,

14:20.294 --> 14:22.426
it's an opportunity
to gain a new customer,

14:22.470 --> 14:24.341
client or patient
for your business.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.870
[Lane] Local businesses,
small businesses,

14:30.913 --> 14:33.263
should have the right
to be able to say,

14:33.307 --> 14:34.743
"I don't want to be on here."

14:36.397 --> 14:37.267
And there is no... There is
no ability for them to do that.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.705
[Teran] I think
it's definitely unfair

14:40.749 --> 14:42.838
that businesses cannot be
removed from Yelp.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.187
Even at our darkest point,

14:44.231 --> 14:46.537
where all our reviews
were being deleted,

14:46.581 --> 14:48.322
you know, I would ask them.
I would say...

14:48.365 --> 14:50.367
I was like, "Can we just
delete our account?

14:50.411 --> 14:51.934
I mean, can we just
get rid of this?"

14:51.978 --> 14:53.631
And they would tell me that
there's nothing to do.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.111
Your page is there forever.

14:55.503 --> 14:58.462
What I want, what every
other business wants,

14:58.506 --> 15:01.117
give me the option
to walk out from your list,

15:01.161 --> 15:02.205
and I will.

15:03.641 --> 15:04.686
If I can call them up right now
and say take us off,

15:04.729 --> 15:06.557
I would take us
off Yelp. 100 %.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.082
Someone in Yelp

15:09.343 --> 15:12.302
is taking every business
they can find,

15:12.346 --> 15:14.696
and any business that
they think is out there,

15:14.739 --> 15:16.350
and putting it in one place.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.656
And then,
imposing restrictions

15:18.700 --> 15:21.268
on how you represent
your own business.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.035
[Woman] Do you ever look
at the filtered reviews?

15:49.078 --> 15:50.210
Filtered reviews?

15:50.253 --> 15:51.602
The... The what?

15:51.646 --> 15:54.127
I'm not aware of
the filtering system.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.433
No, I've never heard
of that. [Chuckles]

15:56.477 --> 15:58.000
Are those the bad reviews?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.655
I've read some of
the filtered reviews before

16:00.698 --> 16:04.267
but I didn't realize that
they were, um, filtered out

16:04.311 --> 16:06.443
by Yelp for
a particular reason.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.930
[Man] Let's say you wanna check out a new restaurant in town.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.410
Your foodie friend
has been there.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.889
The gentleman
who lives next door

16:17.933 --> 16:19.979
who only goes out to eat
once a year has been there

16:20.022 --> 16:21.371
and that new guy
across the street

16:21.415 --> 16:23.025
that you just met
has been there.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.809
So you ask them all
what they thought.

16:26.898 --> 16:27.725
And you're probably gonna trust one of
those opinions more than the others.

16:29.031 --> 16:29.640
Because no matter
how nice the gentleman is,

16:30.815 --> 16:31.294
he only goes out
to eat once a year.

16:32.034 --> 16:32.817
And the new guy, well,

16:34.123 --> 16:35.037
you don't really know
anything about him yet.

16:36.865 --> 16:37.866
Yelp understands that just as your neighbor's restaurant opinions

16:39.172 --> 16:40.260
may not be as useful
as your foodie friend's,

16:40.303 --> 16:42.088
not all reviews
are created equal.

16:42.131 --> 16:45.569
Which is exactly why we recommend some reviews and not others.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.571
Reviews that Yelp
doesn't recommend

16:47.615 --> 16:49.051
can still be seen via a link

16:49.095 --> 16:51.358
on the bottom of each
business' profile page.

16:51.401 --> 16:54.056
But they don't factor into the business' overall star rating.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.754
I was really interested
to look at

16:56.798 --> 16:58.234
the reviews that were filtered

16:58.278 --> 16:59.975
and the reviews
that weren't filtered,

17:00.019 --> 17:04.109
because it just seemed like a really interesting comparison to me

17:04.153 --> 17:06.155
to see which reviews
were getting prioritized

17:06.199 --> 17:08.027
over the ones
that were being filtered.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.594
And the discrepancy
was quite staggering.

17:11.290 --> 17:14.468
I think the first thing I found
was in the content guidelines.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.686
They lay out all of
these bullet points

17:16.731 --> 17:18.298
for how you're supposed
to be on Yelp.

17:18.340 --> 17:21.344
So, "Colorful language
and imagery is fine,

17:21.387 --> 17:23.041
but there's no need
for threats, harassment,

17:23.085 --> 17:25.608
lewdness, hate speech,
or other displays of bigotry."

17:26.262 --> 17:29.048
That's great. That's exactly
what I want to hear

17:29.091 --> 17:31.746
if everyone is forced
to have this review page.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.183
I don't want to read things that are bigoted or hate speech.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.317
And then I started looking
at the actual reviews

17:37.360 --> 17:40.276
and they did not live up

17:40.320 --> 17:43.845
to the content guidelines
that Yelp had set forward.

17:43.888 --> 17:47.240
For instance, uh, this was
one review that I found.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.285
[Reading]

18:04.039 --> 18:07.347
That sounds like...
What would Yelp call that?

18:07.390 --> 18:10.176
That would be,
uh... "No need for threats, harassment,

18:10.219 --> 18:12.047
lewdness, hate speech,

18:12.091 --> 18:14.484
and other displays
of bigotry."

18:14.832 --> 18:17.792
Well, then the next day after
this guy wrote the review,

18:17.835 --> 18:18.749
so I'm thinking, you know,

18:19.924 --> 18:20.925
"Maybe someone from Yelp
hasn't seen this,

18:22.405 --> 18:23.189
maybe this is just one
that slipped through the net."

18:24.320 --> 18:26.279
The community manager
for Yelp said,

18:26.322 --> 18:29.760
"Can't wait to check out all those killer reviews you're cooking up, Jim."

18:30.761 --> 18:33.112
[Mumbles]
That's not really a review.

18:33.373 --> 18:36.593
Saying that you walk into a bar that's full of ugly chicks

18:36.637 --> 18:41.032
who won't sleep with you
is really not, uh...

18:41.076 --> 18:43.034
It's not really a review
of the establishment.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.384
I'm not sure what it is.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.909
I have one from
the 9/11 Memorial,

18:47.952 --> 18:49.954
which is up
and which is on the page.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.479
Hasn't been filtered.
Hasn't been taken down.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.481
[Reading]

18:57.484 --> 19:00.008
"If you want to see
the effects of 9/11,

19:00.051 --> 19:02.750
just look at the pile of rubble next to the museum."

19:03.881 --> 19:08.103
And this was a review that was filtered for the 9/11 Memorial.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.454
"As a New Yorker
who saw 9/11 firsthand,

19:11.498 --> 19:13.195
it's beautiful to see
what they've done

19:13.239 --> 19:14.762
to help remember
those who were lost

19:14.805 --> 19:16.329
by creating this memorial.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.114
You close your eyes and you
feel different emotions,

19:19.158 --> 19:20.463
you feel peace.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.727
Beautiful, and a must-see
for anyone visiting New York."

19:24.163 --> 19:26.948
Having a Yelp for Auschwitz

19:26.991 --> 19:30.386
seems to be in
serious poor taste.

19:30.430 --> 19:34.390
I think it just shouldn't
be there at all, really.

19:34.434 --> 19:37.872
I mean, who leaves a review
of one of the worst sites?

19:39.395 --> 19:41.745
They haven't got the Cambodian death fields yet

19:41.789 --> 19:42.659
but I'm surprised.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.318
I feel like it's one thing
to review a restaurant

19:49.362 --> 19:52.321
and to review a bar
and a place of business.

19:52.365 --> 19:56.499
But to allow people to say
stuff about memorials...

19:57.544 --> 19:58.980
It just doesn't seem right

19:59.023 --> 20:00.329
and it doesn't seem right

20:00.373 --> 20:02.201
that they have this
content guidelines

20:02.244 --> 20:05.160
where it's like nothing
offensive, no hate speech.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.423
Who is enforcing
these guidelines?

20:07.467 --> 20:10.948
Because I can't really see
any enforcement on that.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.212
I see a lot of nasty reviews

20:13.255 --> 20:17.477
and almost pitting the consumer against the business.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.957
If you're going to
filter reviews,

20:20.001 --> 20:21.742
that's fine,
it's your website.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.048
But you're not explaining
your criteria

20:24.092 --> 20:25.093
for filtering them.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.444
And worse yet, you're putting
out some content guidelines

20:28.488 --> 20:29.619
and you're not
adhering to them.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.058
[Indistinct chatter]

20:34.102 --> 20:35.538
[Cerretini]
After a couple of months,

20:37.279 --> 20:38.889
we started receiving very aggressive phone calls from a guy.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.284
So aggressive that I actually told him a few times

20:42.328 --> 20:43.633
to go fuck himself.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.940
A Yelp representative
reached out

20:45.983 --> 20:49.422
and we refused their offer
to market on their website

20:49.465 --> 20:52.642
and after doing so,
within three to five days,

20:52.686 --> 20:54.601
we had three good
reviews disappear

20:54.644 --> 20:56.429
and one bad review appear.

20:56.472 --> 20:59.345
The sales representative
was calling me daily.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.956
It wasn't till after
our conversation,

21:01.999 --> 21:03.958
and me denying their service,

21:04.001 --> 21:09.268
that our Yelp page got spammed
with 15 of the same reviews

21:09.311 --> 21:11.574
stating the same exact thing.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.795
You can call it coincidence,
you know, uh...

21:14.838 --> 21:17.667
A corporation like that
that is, you know,

21:17.972 --> 21:22.019
accused of extortion from
every corner of the country

21:22.063 --> 21:25.327
should not have that coincidence happen in the first place.

21:25.719 --> 21:29.331
So what happened
after not even a day,

21:29.375 --> 21:32.943
suddenly, you see three
or four bad reviews appear

21:32.987 --> 21:35.076
and some of the good ones
disappear.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.340
They take your good reviews that are legitimate and they filter them,

21:38.384 --> 21:40.429
and they put them in
this section at the bottom

21:40.473 --> 21:41.691
that nobody looks at.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.171
It doesn't come up on Google

21:43.214 --> 21:44.607
and it doesn't affect
the star rating.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.783
[Ronn Owens]
The claim that, you know,

21:46.827 --> 21:48.655
I was asked to
advertise with Yelp.

21:49.003 --> 21:52.006
I said no, and all of a sudden
I went from four stars to one.

21:52.615 --> 21:53.616
How do you react?

21:54.835 --> 21:55.531
[Sollitto] Uh, we hear it
all the time.

21:55.575 --> 21:56.532
[Owens] I know you do.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.274
[Sollitto] And unfortunately,
it's not a true statement

21:59.318 --> 22:01.276
as far as what we do.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.279
One of the ways business owners
think that this happens

22:04.323 --> 22:05.889
is that they get a call
from Yelp saying,

22:05.933 --> 22:07.761
"Hey, you have a decent
reputation on Yelp.

22:07.804 --> 22:10.024
You should think about advertising,
so more people can see you."

22:11.199 --> 22:13.810
And they say, "No, thanks,"
and they hang up the phone.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.072
And they look at Yelp
and go,

22:15.116 --> 22:16.509
"Gosh, I do have
a reputation on Yelp.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.075
I should go get all my friends
and family members

22:18.119 --> 22:19.381
to start writing reviews."

22:20.861 --> 22:22.558
And so, within 24 hours
of getting that phone call,

22:22.602 --> 22:24.299
they suddenly solicit,
you know,

22:24.343 --> 22:26.257
dozens of five-star reviews

22:26.301 --> 22:28.738
that then end up getting
filtered out the next day

22:28.782 --> 22:31.828
because our software can't
recommend or trust them.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.530
My family has a history
in home improvement.

22:38.008 --> 22:42.404
And so, I started Allied
Outdoor Solutions in 2009.

22:43.666 --> 22:47.061
And now we're one of the larger residential construction companies

22:47.104 --> 22:48.236
in the state.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.544
We originally contacted Yelp

22:51.587 --> 22:55.156
because we saw many of our
reviews being filtered out.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.288
And at that time,

22:57.332 --> 22:59.334
I believe we didn't have any,

22:59.378 --> 23:02.163
quote-unquote, positive reviews
that were unfiltered.

23:02.206 --> 23:05.601
The only things that were
showing were one-star reviews.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.908
Uh, and it was only a couple,
but it only takes a couple

23:07.951 --> 23:09.344
to have the average
be one star.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.216
We just contacted Yelp
trying to see

23:12.260 --> 23:14.958
why our real reviews
from actual customers

23:15.002 --> 23:16.395
were being filtered out

23:16.438 --> 23:17.874
and not affecting
our score in any way.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.703
[Over phone]

23:34.151 --> 23:37.285
The only way to improve
my rating on Yelp

23:37.328 --> 23:38.504
was to advertise.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.115
He said if you talk
to your customers

23:41.158 --> 23:42.812
and you can't get them
to change their rating

23:42.856 --> 23:44.161
to a positive from negative,

23:44.205 --> 23:45.902
then advertising
is your option.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.514
We had a one-star review

23:48.557 --> 23:50.646
and we reached out
to this customer,

23:50.690 --> 23:52.518
and he had never talked to us
about his experience.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.433
So we reached out and we said, "Hey,
we never talked to you.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.217
We didn't realize
you had a bad experience."

23:56.260 --> 23:59.655
And so, he explained why
and what the problem was

23:59.699 --> 24:01.265
and, fortunately, that was
a problem we could fix.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.050
And so, we went out,

24:03.093 --> 24:04.660
we fixed the problem,

24:04.704 --> 24:06.009
made him a happy customer.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.013
He updated his Yelp review
from a one star to a four star.

24:10.057 --> 24:14.148
It was populated in our unfiltered reviews as a one star

24:14.191 --> 24:16.106
and when he upgraded it
to a four star,

24:16.367 --> 24:20.197
it, within a few days,
had been filtered out.

24:20.241 --> 24:23.505
So, it was pretty telling when we have
a one-star review that Yelp believes

24:23.766 --> 24:26.726
is a valid review
from a valid customer.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.511
We go to that customer,
we make things right

24:29.555 --> 24:31.252
because there is
a way that we can.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.688
He upgrades it
to a four-star review.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.517
Within a few days,
it's no longer showing up on our profile.

24:37.432 --> 24:38.651
That was kind of when I read the handwriting on the wall,
if you will.

24:38.694 --> 24:41.697
We have no problems
once a customer calls us

24:41.741 --> 24:43.873
and we come out because
then they see our company.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.658
They hear our company's story.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.050
They see pictures of our work.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.445
I don't believe that
we've ever lost a job

24:50.489 --> 24:51.881
over a Yelp review

24:51.925 --> 24:54.493
when that customer met with us.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.843
But there are countless
number of people

24:56.886 --> 25:01.325
that didn't call us because of our not so great Yelp rating.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.373
[Man] Currently, about 75 % of
all reviews are recommended.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.375
We try not to
highlight reviews

25:07.418 --> 25:09.290
written by users
we don't know much about

25:09.333 --> 25:10.726
or those that might be fakes

25:10.770 --> 25:12.423
or unhelpful rants or raves.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.688
Of our 21 reviews,

25:15.731 --> 25:17.733
only seven of them
are not filtered,

25:18.168 --> 25:20.257
so 33 % are not filtered

25:20.301 --> 25:23.173
and two-thirds of our reviews
are filtered out.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.524
[Man] It's also important
to note that Yelp treats

25:25.567 --> 25:28.614
advertisers and non-advertisers
exactly the same.

25:28.657 --> 25:31.181
Our recommendation software
is entirely automated.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.183
Which means the same
objective standards

25:33.227 --> 25:35.577
are applied to every business
and every review

25:35.621 --> 25:37.274
to ensure no one gets
preferential treatment.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.409
[Vitol] A month prior to my six-month contract running out,

25:41.452 --> 25:45.065
I sent them the notice
that I wanted it to end.

25:45.108 --> 25:47.110
As they require,
otherwise it'll keep...

25:47.154 --> 25:49.417
They'll keep charging you
month by month.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.158
That same week,

25:51.201 --> 25:55.031
I started noticing my
five-star reviews dropping.

25:55.075 --> 25:57.207
I also started noticing that

25:57.251 --> 26:00.602
any new five-star
reviews I got

26:00.646 --> 26:04.606
would stay up on my page
not even a day.

26:04.650 --> 26:05.651
By the end of the day,

26:07.174 --> 26:08.697
they would just drop into
the non-recommended section.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.612
It was really incredible

26:10.656 --> 26:13.789
how precise it was.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.878
Recently, I had
a customer come in

26:15.922 --> 26:17.750
and had a great experience.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.535
Her dog was a lot
of fun to have here

26:20.579 --> 26:23.146
and she gave us
a five-star review.

26:23.190 --> 26:24.104
And I was thrilled.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.673
You know,
I was thinking I was getting my five-star rating back,

26:27.716 --> 26:31.764
and same day
that review dropped.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.898
All of her other reviews
are considered recommended

26:35.942 --> 26:38.509
under the other
businesses' profiles.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.121
So I was curious.
I contacted this customer

26:41.164 --> 26:42.601
and just asked her,

26:44.341 --> 26:45.560
"By the way,
is this review showing up when you log in to Yelp?

26:46.996 --> 26:48.824
Is it showing up as a review
that is recommended?"

26:49.303 --> 26:51.479
And she sent me
a screenshot of it

26:51.522 --> 26:54.700
and it absolutely shows that
it's a recommended review

26:54.743 --> 26:56.789
when she logs in
to her profile.

27:11.368 --> 27:14.676
I feel that Yelp continually masquerades as a public service,

27:14.720 --> 27:16.199
like, "This is for the public.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.419
You can get, like,
a fair and balanced opinion."

27:19.202 --> 27:21.944
But, in essence,
you're segregating people.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.685
You have the elite on the top.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.556
You have everybody else
in the middle.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.515
And then you have
the outcasts at the bottom.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.082
But you're not telling us

27:29.125 --> 27:31.214
what your criteria
for segregating people are,

27:31.258 --> 27:32.694
you're just randomly doing it.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.131
And that raises
questions for me.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.136
[Upbeat rock music playing]

27:51.582 --> 27:54.716
Congratulations and welcome
to the Yelp Elite Squad.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.631
Click the shiny badge
on your profile

27:56.675 --> 27:58.459
and it'll take you
to a private calendar

27:58.502 --> 28:00.243
that only Elites can see.

28:00.287 --> 28:04.508
I have researched as much as I can about elite members,

28:04.552 --> 28:07.294
and the process
is shrouded in mystery.

28:07.337 --> 28:10.297
It's pretty much like joining the league of assassins or something,

28:10.340 --> 28:11.602
to become a Yelp Elite.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.735
That's how open it is.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.738
To apply for
an elite membership,

28:16.782 --> 28:18.305
doesn't really say.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.263
How they select
their Yelp Elite,

28:20.611 --> 28:21.700
doesn't really say.

28:23.136 --> 28:23.963
It says they... They'll know it
when they see it.

28:25.225 --> 28:26.139
And they're looking
for a je ne sais quoi.

28:27.401 --> 28:29.751
The Elite Yelpers have
a huge amount of power.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.014
It seems like they're
more like interns

28:32.058 --> 28:35.888
and their position to go to all these really extravagant parties

28:35.931 --> 28:37.716
where they're treated
like celebrities

28:37.759 --> 28:39.718
and they, kind of,
walk into restaurants

28:39.761 --> 28:40.893
and be like, "I'm an elite."

28:42.285 --> 28:42.851
And, you know,
everyone's supposed to bow down

28:43.939 --> 28:44.244
and give them
lots of free stuff.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.464
But why are these people
being given so much power?

28:48.552 --> 28:52.078
[Susan Reynolds] Some of these Elite Yelpers have left 5,000 reviews.

28:52.121 --> 28:54.341
I will write, you know,
how I feel about the food

28:54.384 --> 28:55.951
and be 100 % honest about it.

28:55.995 --> 28:59.433
But that isn't the case
with Yelpers

28:59.476 --> 29:01.696
because they are taking
all these freebies.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.480
I'm in the restaurant business,

29:05.091 --> 29:06.527
I don't think I've been in 500 restaurants in all my life.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.617
You know, there are people here
that are 21 years old,

29:09.660 --> 29:12.533
and in two years, they wrote
a review for 500 businesses.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.490
Let me ask you this,

29:13.534 --> 29:14.883
how is it fucking possible?

29:16.450 --> 29:18.452
I mean, if you're going to work,
and you have a family,

29:18.495 --> 29:20.454
and you have time
to have a little sex,

29:20.497 --> 29:23.587
you're not gonna...
You're not gonna have time to write all those reviews.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.894
What it means
to be a Yelp Elite,

29:25.938 --> 29:28.201
is that you,
every now and again,

29:28.244 --> 29:30.812
will have the opportunity
to go to...

29:30.856 --> 29:32.292
Um, they're called
Elite Tastings.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.556
So, there's like a little, like,
appetizers and stuff like that,

29:35.599 --> 29:38.124
all the way on up
to really fancy tastings

29:38.167 --> 29:40.300
at, like, Michelin star
rated restaurants.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.563
Those ones are more rare,
but they happen.

29:42.606 --> 29:44.304
We actually bring
these people together

29:44.652 --> 29:48.699
uh, every few weeks
for parties that we call...

29:48.743 --> 29:51.137
We have this Yelp Elite Squad
and we bring them together,

29:51.180 --> 29:52.486
and they get
to meet each other.

29:54.009 --> 29:54.793
And it's working professionals,
just like you and me.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.404
[Renee]
You get to meet the chef.

29:57.447 --> 30:01.451
They give you appetizers,
their entrees,

30:02.104 --> 30:05.194
various other things that they really want you to try,

30:05.238 --> 30:07.022
along with drinks and so on.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.851
So, this could be something
where a restaurant

30:09.895 --> 30:12.680
may be wanting
to premiere a new menu.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.943
Or I think it could be
like, blossoming business

30:14.987 --> 30:16.815
and they want to, sort of
spread the word.

30:16.858 --> 30:20.557
And then, sometimes,
it really is just a treat for the Elites.

30:20.601 --> 30:21.732
And that rhymes, but...

30:25.519 --> 30:28.435
They hold more weight
than someone

30:28.478 --> 30:30.263
who's written, say, 20 reviews.

30:30.306 --> 30:33.962
The interesting thing is that I find just as many inaccuracies

30:34.006 --> 30:39.011
and a lack of knowledge about the food they're writing about,
in the Elite Yelpers.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.578
A Yelp review is like gold

30:41.622 --> 30:43.798
'cause if you get
a five-star Yelp Elite,

30:43.842 --> 30:45.408
it's there forever.

They can give me
20 stars on Yelp

30:47.802 --> 30:49.586

prejudiced reviews

into their head...

was too garlicky.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.471

for their actions,

31:17.484 --> 31:20.356
as a pack of wild animals,

[Stolfi-Tow] The problem
with the Yelp Elite,

31:25.318 --> 31:26.449
is the reviewers are just very naive to how small businesses are,

31:26.493 --> 31:27.886
and can be very arrogant.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.411

to wield this power, as well.

I guess we'll see, won't we?

31:54.477 --> 31:56.610
Oh, God! Now everyone
thinks they're a food critic.

31:57.741 --> 32:00.266
What's this vindictiveness
that Yelpers have?

32:00.309 --> 32:03.051
These one-star, like,
"Ooh, I'm gonna destroy you."

32:03.095 --> 32:04.923
It's just such
anti-social behavior.

32:05.445 --> 32:08.448
Once potential online reviews
start to be used

32:08.491 --> 32:11.668
for leverage,
for a discount on a project or something like that,

32:11.712 --> 32:14.280
then, you know,
I think that's not the way

32:14.976 --> 32:18.458
even Yelp would have intended
for their reviews to be used.

32:21.809 --> 32:24.203
My name is Ayesha Kiani

32:24.246 --> 32:27.554

in New York with my mother.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.471
One of the things
that I found out

32:32.080 --> 32:34.909
was how easy
it is to buy reviews.

32:35.344 --> 32:38.608
I wanted media to pick this up

32:38.652 --> 32:41.263
that the reviews
can be bought easily.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.440
I created an ad for Craigslist.

32:44.919 --> 32:48.357
I would get at least
about 50 to 70 requests

32:48.401 --> 32:49.837
each time I posted the ad.

some easy money."

will you charge?"

33:04.634 --> 33:06.985
And he said, "I'll be willing
to do it for $50."

33:07.942 --> 33:11.990
A lot of the initial requests that came from,
were from Yelp Elites.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.557
Some were very picky
and very demanding.

33:14.601 --> 33:15.994

"Oh, you know,

33:17.560 --> 33:20.563
I would have a meal,
and I would also write your review.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.262

is $50."

to the landlord.

34:04.172 --> 34:06.087
And the landlord said,
"Well, you're right.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.349
It's sort of
gotten out of hand.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.003
How many spaces do you need?"

34:09.047 --> 34:11.049
Because my shop
operates by appointment,

34:11.092 --> 34:13.399
and we usually only have
one customer at a time.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.357
I said, "Really,
all I need is one."

34:15.400 --> 34:17.359
So he said, "Well, that's
more than reasonable.

34:17.402 --> 34:19.405
We'll dedicate
one spot to you."

34:20.188 --> 34:22.755
We put up this big obelisk
that says,

34:22.799 --> 34:23.757
"Piano store only.

34:24.975 --> 34:25.541
If you park here,
well, you'll be towed."

34:25.802 --> 34:26.889
Still,

34:26.934 --> 34:29.719
a lot of people
going into the ski shop

34:29.763 --> 34:32.331
would park there anyway,
and not care.

34:33.375 --> 34:34.898
I complained again
to the landlord.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.380
He said, "Okay, well,
let's start towing them and see what happens."

34:39.077 --> 34:41.034
The first four people
that got towed

34:41.079 --> 34:42.514
wrote a negative Yelp review.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.255
- [Keyboard clacking]
- [Gerald] In finality,

34:45.735 --> 34:46.562
I would say my experience
at Applebee's was sublime

34:48.129 --> 34:49.956
and my treatment near that
of a gladiator most decorated.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.437
But the street parking
wasn't that great.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.481
Two-and-a-half stars.

34:55.179 --> 34:56.224
Yes.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.489
I didn't think that was fair.

35:00.533 --> 35:01.708
So, I called,

35:01.751 --> 35:03.231
and the girl I spoke to said,

35:03.275 --> 35:06.234
"Yeah, you know, I'm sorry.
Freedom of the press.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.845
They can say anything.
You know, we can't take it off.

35:08.889 --> 35:12.153
Or if it was a false thing,
our algorithm would've caught it.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.286
So, you know,
I can't help you."

35:14.808 --> 35:17.637
The next day,
at ten o'clock in the morning

35:17.680 --> 35:20.161
I got a call from their
advertising department

35:20.205 --> 35:22.032
saying, "Would you like
to advertise with Yelp?"

35:22.076 --> 35:24.034
[Playing lively music]

35:24.905 --> 35:25.819
I said to the girl,

35:26.907 --> 35:27.734
"Hey, why should
I advertise with you

35:29.170 --> 35:29.953
when people who had parking
were never in my shop,

35:30.998 --> 35:32.130
are writing nasty things
about us?"

35:33.479 --> 35:34.480
She said, "Well, Mr.
Kassman, don't worry.

35:34.523 --> 35:37.135
If you spend
$400 a month with us,

35:37.178 --> 35:40.442
we can manage
your reviews for you."

35:40.486 --> 35:42.009
And I said,
"What do you mean?"

35:42.052 --> 35:44.185
She said, "We can help you
with it. Don't worry.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.056
Just $400 a month

35:48.146 --> 35:51.018
and we can really make sure that your
online reputation is absolutely fine."

35:51.540 --> 35:54.282
And I said not only no,
"Hell, no."

35:58.330 --> 36:00.462
- [Woman] Hi, Mr. Martinez.
- Hello, hello.

36:02.508 --> 36:03.726
[Woman]
Is that knee getting better?

36:03.770 --> 36:04.945
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Woman] Good.

36:05.337 --> 36:08.427
[Dawn King]
We had a former employee

36:08.470 --> 36:12.909
leave a fake Yelp message,

36:12.953 --> 36:16.913
um, as a retaliation
for her being terminated.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.569
"I am a former patient
of Dr. King,

36:20.613 --> 36:23.224
and I had
a in-office surgery..."

36:23.268 --> 36:24.530
Their grammar, not mine.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.096
"...here, one year ago.

36:26.140 --> 36:29.709
Worst of all, she gave me
an infection in my IV line,

36:29.752 --> 36:33.365
and I ended up in the emergency room,
in serious condition.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.889
Dr. King did not inform me

36:35.932 --> 36:37.325
of the reason
why I was sick.

36:37.369 --> 36:41.242
Her and the front-desk lady,
Cindy, are AA members.

36:41.677 --> 36:45.377
I will never go back to this office,
they nearly killed me."

36:48.989 --> 36:51.905
Just because
the grammar and syntax

36:51.948 --> 36:53.907
had her fingerprints all over it,
we knew who it was.

36:54.647 --> 36:57.824
This person has zero friends,
one review.

36:57.867 --> 37:01.001
This was the first review
that had no pictures,

37:01.044 --> 37:02.742
but... And one star.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.526
So it was allowed
to be put on our page.

37:11.707 --> 37:15.233
I sent an email
to feedback@yelp.com.

37:15.885 --> 37:19.411
Oddly, that afternoon
I received a call

37:20.150 --> 37:22.152
from someone
named Terry at Yelp.

37:22.196 --> 37:25.025
Um, I thought it was
regarding the review,

37:25.460 --> 37:27.332
but it was
regarding advertising.

37:33.381 --> 37:36.036
[Rossmann] We fix Apple
products, primarily laptops.

37:36.689 --> 37:38.299
My business
focuses on the products

37:38.343 --> 37:40.736
that other businesses
and Apple don't want to fix.

37:41.911 --> 37:44.305
First sales call that I got,
they did what they usually do,

37:44.349 --> 37:46.699
which is flatter you for what you're presently doing,

37:46.742 --> 37:48.788
and then try to talk
about the benefits.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.790
And this just went
on and on and on.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.357
And eventually, I just said,

37:54.359 --> 37:56.709
"Listen, I have a friend who pays almost
$2,000 a month for your advertising

37:56.752 --> 38:00.278
and he has not gotten increased business due to Yelp."

38:00.321 --> 38:01.670
Then I get an email.

38:01.714 --> 38:02.758
It says, "I don't understand

38:04.369 --> 38:05.413
why you think Yelp isn't helping your friend's business.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.023
Here are his back-end stats."

38:07.067 --> 38:09.112
So because I claimed
to be friends with somebody,

38:09.156 --> 38:12.072
you now see fit to send me
all their personal statistics,

38:12.115 --> 38:13.378
so I can know
how many deals they sold.

38:13.421 --> 38:14.422
I could see
how many views he had,

38:15.684 --> 38:16.294
I could see how many
calls to action he had.

38:17.730 --> 38:18.644
It's not information
that I should be able to see.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.123
So, I uploaded
a video about it.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.256
Just in case you can't see,
it says, "Hey, Louis,

38:22.300 --> 38:24.040
here is the business
Sunny has seen from us

38:24.084 --> 38:25.303
since he began to advertise.

38:27.130 --> 38:27.827
I am a little confused to why you think this isn't working for him.

38:29.698 --> 38:30.612
Please let me know when you can speak for a few minutes about this.

38:30.656 --> 38:31.831
Best, Erica."

38:33.354 --> 38:35.574
When you give away confidential
customer information,

38:35.617 --> 38:39.186
why would I ever feel inclined
to be your client?

38:41.406 --> 38:43.930
I upload that video and a few days later she is fired.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.194
I had no idea
that this woman was fired

38:47.237 --> 38:48.717
until I received a phone call.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.545
[Man over phone]
I wanna congratulate you.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.635
You put a little stuff on the Internet last night about that Yelp.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.856
You ruined a 23-year-old's life.
You got her fired.

38:56.899 --> 38:59.249
You know what happens to people
that are shitbags like you?

38:59.293 --> 39:00.294
Bad karma.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.165
- [Rossmann] "Bad karma"?
- [Man] You get paid...

39:03.689 --> 39:04.080
Bad karma. God will pay you back,
you piece of shit.

39:05.778 --> 39:06.344
- [Rossmann] Coal for Christmas is fine.
- [Line disconnects]

39:08.302 --> 39:09.912
I thought it was a joke that's why I said "Coal for Christmas is fine."

39:09.956 --> 39:11.914
And that's when I decided,
let me Google this phone number

39:11.958 --> 39:15.614
and that's when I realized that that person works for a law firm

39:15.657 --> 39:17.964
called Sperber Denenberg
& Kahan, PC.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.358
And I said, "Oh, you've got
to be kidding me!"

39:20.401 --> 39:22.664
I really wasn't expecting
Yelp stuff to go this far.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.362
So, then I did a second video.

39:24.405 --> 39:26.581
The name of that salesperson
that was contacting me,

39:26.625 --> 39:28.583
I believe, was Erica Sperber.

39:28.627 --> 39:30.890
I wind up getting these calls,
calling me a shitbag,

39:30.933 --> 39:32.587
and, "God is gonna
get you back,"

39:32.631 --> 39:33.675
and blah, blah, blah,

39:33.719 --> 39:35.938
from members
of that person's family.

39:35.982 --> 39:37.026
And they were
actually calling me

39:37.070 --> 39:38.027
from their work telephone.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.204
After that video
is when I realized

39:41.248 --> 39:43.076
I had a negative review
on my page.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.991
The fake review
was left by somebody

39:45.034 --> 39:46.471
who said that we took
their laptop,

39:46.514 --> 39:48.255
we didn't have
the part to fix it,

39:48.298 --> 39:49.604
we gave it back to them
in pieces,

39:49.648 --> 39:52.215
far worse than it was,
and that was that.

39:52.520 --> 39:56.959
The first fishy part of this was that we
have 600 parts for that specific machine.

39:57.003 --> 39:58.526
The machine that
was mentioned is...

39:58.570 --> 40:00.920
You literally are tripping,
walking through the store

40:00.963 --> 40:04.271
because I bought
600 of that part.

40:04.314 --> 40:07.579
Second thing that was fishy
was that your profile says

40:07.622 --> 40:09.319
that you're in,
I believe, Chicago,

40:09.363 --> 40:11.191
which is very, very
far away from New York.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.758
So I looked this user up
on Yelp

40:12.801 --> 40:14.412
and I see that they're friends
with Erica Sperber.

40:15.282 --> 40:17.545
This is my Yelp salesperson.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.896
This is Jordan K.
This is Erica's friend.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.463
This is the person
that left the bad review

40:22.507 --> 40:23.943
at my local business.

40:23.986 --> 40:26.467
So, what happened here
is simple.

40:26.511 --> 40:27.642
Uh, I told
the Yelp salesperson

40:27.686 --> 40:29.339
I don't wanna pay
for advertising.

40:29.383 --> 40:31.733
I told them why I didn't
wanna pay for advertising.

40:31.777 --> 40:34.083
I hung up,
and when they refused to stop contacting me,

40:34.127 --> 40:35.694
I posted a video about it.

40:35.737 --> 40:38.087
That person decided
to tell their friends,

40:38.131 --> 40:39.306
that are Yelp Eliters,

40:41.003 --> 40:43.571
"Hey, you should leave bogus bad reviews on this guy's page."

40:44.442 --> 40:47.923
And then bogus bad reviews
were left on my page.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.011
That is extortion.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.810
Once we went IPO,
so much changed so fast.

41:04.853 --> 41:07.639
The company was expanding
so quickly, globally.

41:07.682 --> 41:10.119
I was, you know,
sensitive to the stress,

41:10.163 --> 41:13.862
and I ended up getting shingles a couple times,
I couldn't get rid of it.

41:13.906 --> 41:16.430
There was
an increased awareness

41:16.474 --> 41:19.520
of the money being
the most important thing,

41:19.564 --> 41:22.218
instead of the values
being the most important thing.

41:22.262 --> 41:25.004
Instead of the local business owners being the most important thing.

41:25.874 --> 41:28.224
[Rossmann] Yelp endorses
this type of culture.

41:28.268 --> 41:30.792
It's, you know,
this boiler room sales environment

41:30.836 --> 41:32.707
with a lot of young people
who have a low base pay,

41:32.751 --> 41:35.580
who are really encouraged
to get results or get out.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.582
And what do you think
they're going to do?

41:38.974 --> 41:41.934
Yelp's management clearly doesn't believe that the buck stops with them,

41:41.977 --> 41:44.502
because what they are doing
is they're saying,

41:44.545 --> 41:46.678
"Well, that person
was acting independently.

41:46.721 --> 41:49.071
That's not our policy
and, you know,

41:49.115 --> 41:50.682
we fired them. So, there."

41:50.725 --> 41:52.510
And no, that's not
fixing anything.

41:54.076 --> 41:55.817
Erica Sperber
is not the problem,

41:55.861 --> 41:57.645
she was just
following a company culture.

41:57.689 --> 41:58.994
She worked there
for several years,

41:59.038 --> 42:00.474
she was young,
in her early 20s,

42:00.518 --> 42:02.563
probably one of her
first experiences in sales.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.043
And that's the company culture
she worked in.

42:04.086 --> 42:05.784
It's the 30, and the 40,
and the 50-year-olds,

42:05.827 --> 42:08.526
and the higher-ups in the company that are hiring these people,

42:08.569 --> 42:10.876
that should realize
it's their responsibility

42:10.919 --> 42:13.443
to influence the company culture so people don't do that.

42:13.792 --> 42:16.534
They're not fixing anything.
They're avoiding liability.

42:16.925 --> 42:19.014
[Reporter 1] Recently,
Yelp has been on the war path,

42:19.058 --> 42:20.581
cracking down
on small businesses

42:20.625 --> 42:23.932
who offer incentives
in exchange for Yelp reviews.

42:23.976 --> 42:26.674
[Reporter 2] They display
the evidence for all to see,

42:26.718 --> 42:29.764
a kind of scarlet letter
of the Internet age.

42:29.808 --> 42:31.679
You know, this is an ongoing
cat-and-mouse game.

42:31.723 --> 42:33.507
People are always gonna try
to game the system.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.465
[Reporter 2]
A very powerful system.

42:35.509 --> 42:39.339
Yelp gets more than
71 million visitors a month.

42:39.382 --> 42:40.949
[Sollitto] This is not
acceptable behavior.

42:40.993 --> 42:42.429
And frankly,
it's not just unethical,

42:42.472 --> 42:43.430
but it's probably illegal.

42:45.824 --> 42:48.043
[Teran] So a few days after telling a sales representative

42:48.087 --> 42:49.871
I don't want to use
their service,

42:49.915 --> 42:51.656
our Yelp page got spammed

42:51.699 --> 42:57.139
with 15 of the same reviews,
stating the same exact thing.

42:57.183 --> 43:00.316
We had great steak and we had
the best secret sauce.

43:00.360 --> 43:03.668
And we don't carry a steak,
and we don't have a thing called secret sauce.

43:03.711 --> 43:05.583
I reached out
to our sales representative.

43:05.626 --> 43:09.848
And rather than the algorithm
detecting that as spam,

43:09.891 --> 43:14.113
they saw it as if the owner
or someone from the business

43:14.156 --> 43:16.071
was putting up those reviews.

43:16.811 --> 43:19.901
A couple of weeks after that spam hit our account,

43:19.945 --> 43:22.425
they put up a large pop-up

43:22.469 --> 43:24.906
saying that someone
from the business

43:24.950 --> 43:28.170
could be artificially
inflating reviews.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.434
We identified
a number of businesses

43:31.478 --> 43:34.742
that we had caught red-handed
in this activity.

43:34.786 --> 43:37.397
And we put up a big, you know,

43:37.440 --> 43:39.138
a very large alert
on their page

43:39.181 --> 43:41.749
to let consumers know
that something was awry.

43:41.793 --> 43:44.317
Of course, you know,
we're building a review filter,

43:44.360 --> 43:45.840
so it's taking off

43:45.884 --> 43:47.494
this content
in general, anyway.

43:47.537 --> 43:48.756
But we wanted
to make the statement

43:48.800 --> 43:49.714
out there for consumers

43:50.976 --> 43:51.585
that they could know
that this business owner

43:52.978 --> 43:53.631
might have not been acting
in their best interest,

43:55.067 --> 43:55.894
and they might want
to patronize other businesses.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.243
And on top of that, you know,

43:57.286 --> 43:58.897
we wanted them to see
for themselves

43:58.940 --> 44:00.159
what exactly we had found,

44:01.595 --> 44:02.291
so we can be as transparent
about it as possible.

44:03.771 --> 44:06.165
Now they're naming and shaming
businesses who do that,

44:06.208 --> 44:07.427
which is really ridiculous.

44:08.950 --> 44:10.343
I mean, you're a multi-million,
publicly traded company.

44:10.386 --> 44:13.085
What are you doing,
naming and shaming anybody?

44:13.128 --> 44:15.000
That's playground antics,
like, grow up.

44:15.043 --> 44:16.436
Like, honestly. [Laughing]

44:18.090 --> 44:20.005
It feels like it's being operated by a two-year-old child

44:20.048 --> 44:21.441
having a temper tantrum,
sometimes.

44:21.484 --> 44:25.097
To top it off, the 15 reviews
that were spam

44:25.140 --> 44:27.360
got hidden
in the unrecommended.

44:27.403 --> 44:30.276
So, when people would see
the consumer alert

44:30.319 --> 44:33.496
that came up on our page,
they don't understand it.

44:33.540 --> 44:36.717
Because they don't see the 15 reviews that got spammed.

44:36.761 --> 44:38.023
People were asking me,

44:39.502 --> 44:40.068
"Why do you have this consumer block on your page?"

44:40.982 --> 44:42.462
I would wake up every morning,

44:42.505 --> 44:44.986
just hopeless
and in a dark place.

44:45.465 --> 44:48.207
Because there is
nothing you can do

44:48.250 --> 44:50.122
and that's how
they make you feel.

44:50.165 --> 44:53.342
I would call the representatives that I could from Yelp,

44:53.386 --> 44:55.214
because those were the only numbers I would have.

44:55.257 --> 44:57.999
Once it got to that point
where I needed help,

44:58.043 --> 44:59.871
they basically just shunned me.

44:59.914 --> 45:02.569
They told me that there was
no one to talk to here.

45:02.612 --> 45:04.397
They said, "You're on your own.

45:04.440 --> 45:07.313
You can email
the tech services

45:07.356 --> 45:08.880
that they have
on the Yelp page."

45:08.923 --> 45:10.446
Which I did, consistently.

45:10.969 --> 45:13.972
He told me that only Yelpers were the reviews

45:14.015 --> 45:15.582
that, if written,
wouldn't be filtered

45:15.625 --> 45:17.845
because a number
of the negative reviews

45:17.889 --> 45:19.542
was the only review
they had written.

45:19.586 --> 45:22.067
And so, obviously
someone went on to Yelp,

45:22.415 --> 45:25.940
created an account just to write a negative review about my business.

45:25.984 --> 45:29.030
So, if they're writing a negative review about my business,

45:29.074 --> 45:31.859
and it's their only review ever,
it didn't get filtered out.

45:31.903 --> 45:34.122
But if we had customers
that were really happy

45:34.166 --> 45:36.081
and we told them,
"Hey, you're really happy.

45:36.124 --> 45:39.432
You know how you can help us
with your really happy self?

45:39.475 --> 45:40.825
Go write a review on Yelp

45:40.868 --> 45:43.871
because most of the reviews
that we have on there

45:43.915 --> 45:45.960
that are showing up
aren't positive."

45:46.004 --> 45:49.747
But when those people wrote their first review about our business

45:49.790 --> 45:52.271
and it was positive, it got
filtered out within a day.

45:56.710 --> 45:58.973
I had made up my mind that I was going to advertise with them,

45:59.017 --> 46:00.322
but they had
two different programs.

46:01.976 --> 46:03.761
They basically explained that I could try to manage it myself,

46:05.806 --> 46:07.373
and probably waste a lot of money in the process as I was figuring it out.

46:08.287 --> 46:11.420
Or, you know, sign up with them
for six months,

46:11.464 --> 46:12.726
spend a little bit more,

46:12.770 --> 46:15.207
but have a professional
team of experts,

46:15.250 --> 46:17.818
advertising experts,
do it for me.

46:17.862 --> 46:20.734
Um, to me, that sounded
like a great deal, you know?

46:20.778 --> 46:24.651
To have, like, a whole team of ad execs, like,
working on my...

46:25.565 --> 46:28.002
My profile or my campaign.

46:53.941 --> 46:56.291
I've spoken to sales reps.

46:56.335 --> 46:58.119
And they reached out to me,
and I played...

46:58.163 --> 47:00.121
I just wanted to kinda see
what their sales pitch is.

47:00.165 --> 47:01.731
They don't know much
about what they're selling.

47:01.775 --> 47:02.907
They really don't.

47:04.734 --> 47:05.823
They don't know the distinction between clicks and impressions.

47:07.650 --> 47:10.392
As a marketer,
my job is to watch out for my client's businesses.

47:10.436 --> 47:12.177
I want them to grow,
that's how we win.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.309
Let's take a look
at this chart.

47:14.353 --> 47:16.921
Our client bought
1,100 impressions per month

47:16.964 --> 47:19.010
for 486 bucks per month.

47:19.053 --> 47:22.622
Between July 1st and July 6th,
they delivered 1 %.

47:22.665 --> 47:25.146
Well, 1 % of 1,100 is 11.

47:25.190 --> 47:28.280
So, in six days,
they got 11 impressions.

47:28.323 --> 47:30.325
Now, remember,
impressions are just,

47:30.369 --> 47:32.023
"Hey, Yelp showed our ad."

47:32.632 --> 47:35.765
July 28, they delivered 47 %

47:35.809 --> 47:38.029
of the promised
1,100 impressions.

47:38.072 --> 47:39.378
That is just three days left.

47:39.421 --> 47:42.250
They haven't hit half
of what was promised.

47:42.294 --> 47:43.686
Red flags are going off.

47:43.730 --> 47:45.601
I'm thinking,
"How are they going to deliver

47:45.645 --> 47:47.299
the rest of those impressions

47:47.342 --> 47:48.822
in the next three days?"

47:48.866 --> 47:52.173
By the 30th, they jump to 89 %

47:52.217 --> 47:53.479
and it's a miracle!

47:53.522 --> 47:55.481
By the 31st,
they cram everything in.

47:57.613 --> 48:00.703
[Vitol] They manage
the impressions in a way

48:00.747 --> 48:04.403
to either speed up the clicks
or slow down the clicks,

48:04.446 --> 48:07.014
so that it would last
approximately three weeks.

48:08.102 --> 48:11.105
We always met our budget,

48:11.149 --> 48:16.197
their algorithm makes sure that you spend every penny of your budget.

48:16.241 --> 48:19.722
Regardless of the amount
that I was paying per click,

48:19.766 --> 48:23.465
they always managed to get every single last dollar out of that budget.

48:23.509 --> 48:26.033
But it always lasted
exactly three weeks.

48:26.077 --> 48:27.730
It never went over three weeks,

48:27.774 --> 48:29.123
it never went
under three weeks,

48:29.167 --> 48:31.212
and that was something
they never explained to me.

48:51.754 --> 48:54.932
This is where I got really annoyed on behalf of my client.

48:54.975 --> 48:56.324
'Cause what this means is,

48:57.891 --> 49:00.938
in two days, it delivered 43 %,
which is 473 impressions.

49:01.808 --> 49:04.724
That's 236.5 impressions
per day.

49:04.767 --> 49:08.380
One-point-eight,
and it jumped to 236.5.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.949
That's a factor of ten right there.
That's ridiculous.

49:13.776 --> 49:16.649
It's horrible,
because what this is telling me is,

49:16.692 --> 49:18.651
all they care about is,
"I wanna deliver these impressions.

49:18.694 --> 49:21.132
I don't care how,
I don't care to whom,

49:21.175 --> 49:22.611
I don't care where."

49:22.655 --> 49:24.352
[Vitol] I asked them,
"How is this done?

49:24.396 --> 49:27.921
Like, how specific can you narrow down the customer base?

49:27.965 --> 49:31.229
Because my customer base would be within a half-mile of me.

49:31.272 --> 49:33.579
Is that something you can do?
Is that a demographic you can do?"

49:33.622 --> 49:34.623
And they said, "Absolutely.

49:36.408 --> 49:39.019
We can make sure that viewers within a half a mile or a mile of you

49:39.063 --> 49:42.109
can find your business
whenever they do a search."

49:42.153 --> 49:45.460
And it would also appear
on "local businesses" as well.

49:45.504 --> 49:48.246
They were very specific
in their promises,

49:48.289 --> 49:51.684
but once I signed up with them,
their answers were vague.

49:51.727 --> 49:54.078
All of a sudden, it became...

49:55.993 --> 49:58.952
A lot less specific,
let's just say.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.736
I had ads not only
in this area,

50:00.780 --> 50:04.088
but in Manhattan, Queens,

50:04.131 --> 50:06.481
Westchester, New Jersey...

50:06.960 --> 50:08.918
Nobody is going
to wake up in the morning,

50:08.962 --> 50:12.444
and take their dog for day care
across state lines

50:12.487 --> 50:16.274
or even across from Manhattan to Queens or Brooklyn.
No.

50:16.709 --> 50:22.410
I got exactly zero increased business from advertising on Yelp.

50:23.281 --> 50:27.415
[Fong] Ad one and two, that's a good,
high quality location for ads.

50:27.459 --> 50:28.851
As soon as somebody
clicks on there,

50:28.895 --> 50:30.244
they don't have
to scroll anywhere.

50:32.203 --> 50:34.422
As you scroll down the page,
there will be lower quality ad positions.

50:34.466 --> 50:36.163
Keep going down,
keep going... Boom. Right here.

50:36.207 --> 50:38.209
These two ads, lower quality.

50:38.252 --> 50:40.211
Because not everybody
scrolls down the page.

50:40.646 --> 50:42.430
Keep scrolling down,
keep scrolling down,

50:42.474 --> 50:44.824
keep going, keep going,
keep going, look at this.

50:45.868 --> 50:48.610
There are two more ads
down here. Gutter ads.

50:48.654 --> 50:51.091
Few people ever see
these two ads.

50:51.135 --> 50:53.398
And yet, guess what?
They still count as impressions.

50:53.746 --> 50:56.140
Whether people see them or not,
it doesn't matter.

50:56.183 --> 50:57.184
They're still impressions.

50:58.751 --> 51:02.015
My suspicion is my client's
getting garbage impressions.

51:02.059 --> 51:04.713
Meaning their ad's really not doing anything.
They're paying for garbage.

51:04.757 --> 51:06.324
It's just so Yelp
can make their quota

51:06.367 --> 51:08.935
and continue charging my client their monthly fee.

51:08.978 --> 51:12.547
I'm not okay with that, and you,
as a business owner, shouldn't be, I think.

51:14.245 --> 51:16.377
Many of the bad reviews
that we've seen come on

51:16.421 --> 51:18.292
and be featured prominently
on our page,

51:18.336 --> 51:20.120
like, within
the top five reviews,

51:20.164 --> 51:22.992
would be after we've had
some kind of "no sale"

51:23.036 --> 51:25.560
with one of the high-pressure
salespeople that calls us.

51:26.474 --> 51:29.347
It seemed like a lot of the time the ads that would be placed

51:29.390 --> 51:31.218
would be outside
of your key demographic.

51:31.262 --> 51:32.654
So I'm in Arlington, Virginia,

51:32.698 --> 51:34.352
I have a computer
services business

51:34.395 --> 51:37.442
and yet my ad might be
featured 100 miles away

51:37.485 --> 51:41.098
in a non-related category,
say plumbing or baby clothing or something like that.

51:41.750 --> 51:42.838
And that led me to believe

51:44.362 --> 51:45.102
that this was not a good investment for my company.

51:46.842 --> 51:49.628
You're paying an exorbitant cost for very little visibility.

51:51.891 --> 51:54.241
[Roger McManus] Once they see what they get for their money,

51:54.807 --> 51:57.462
they realize it wasn't
necessarily a good deal.

51:57.505 --> 52:00.900
The salespeople say,
"You're gonna get 1,500 impressions."

52:00.943 --> 52:04.164
Now, the problem
is that business people

52:04.208 --> 52:07.211
who are in the business
of doing pizzas or dentistry

52:07.254 --> 52:09.256
or auto repair, or whatever,

52:09.300 --> 52:12.129
are not sophisticated
buyers of advertising.

52:12.172 --> 52:14.174
So when they hear
the number 1,500,

52:14.218 --> 52:16.698
they think they're gonna get
1,500 new customers.

52:16.742 --> 52:18.047
That's not even remotely close.

52:22.269 --> 52:24.532
I cannot say that we pay
and we have better rating.

52:24.576 --> 52:27.231
"Nothing changed, everything's cool,
didn't work for us."

52:27.274 --> 52:29.972
So we end up with the...
We end up the contract,

52:30.016 --> 52:32.192
we say we're not gonna renew it,
and we finish.

52:32.236 --> 52:35.674
The problem starts when they start to call you again

52:35.717 --> 52:37.197
after a couple of months.

52:37.241 --> 52:39.025
And, "You wanna
do advertising with us?"

52:39.068 --> 52:40.722
And, "Why you stop?"
And everything...

52:40.766 --> 52:44.509
My suggestion is, like,
never do advertising with Yelp

52:44.552 --> 52:48.730
because the problem is not when you
do advertising or when you don't do it,

52:48.774 --> 52:51.124
the problem is when you do it and then you stop.

52:51.168 --> 52:54.171
Now, uh, you are in their target,
you can't get out.

52:54.214 --> 52:55.128
[Sollitto] But I can
guarantee you

52:56.695 --> 52:57.435
that, uh, no one is required
to buy advertising on Yelp.

52:58.697 --> 52:59.219
[Owens] Well, yeah,
and that is the genesis

52:59.959 --> 53:00.525
of the extortion idea,

53:02.135 --> 53:03.005
that if you buy,
all of a sudden you get the good reviews,

53:04.137 --> 53:04.703
you don't buy,
you get the bad reviews.

53:05.747 --> 53:06.183
[Sollitto]
That is the accusation--

53:07.401 --> 53:07.749
[Owens] But how can
every single person

53:08.750 --> 53:09.055
who makes that comment
be wrong?

53:10.274 --> 53:10.839
[Sollitto] They are.
It's pretty simple.

53:12.014 --> 53:12.276
There's three things
I could tell you.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.103
Every single claim
to that effect

53:15.322 --> 53:16.323
has been dismissed
by courts five times.

53:17.890 --> 53:20.109
Uh, it's been investigated
by the FTC twice, and closed.

53:20.153 --> 53:22.024
And frankly, there's a Harvard
Business School study

53:22.068 --> 53:25.376
that did an academic study,
that found that our software algorithm

53:25.419 --> 53:28.335
treats advertisers and non-advertiser reviews exactly the same.

53:36.865 --> 53:39.172
I think they're
clearly misinterpreting

53:39.216 --> 53:42.523
the significance of the FTC
closing their investigation.

53:42.871 --> 53:45.700
There are many reasons
why an investigation is closed

53:45.744 --> 53:47.441
and it does not mean

53:47.485 --> 53:50.096
that they've received
a clean bill of health.

53:51.010 --> 53:54.840
Over 2,000 complaints
were filed by businesses

53:54.883 --> 53:56.798
that their rankings
were diminished

53:56.842 --> 54:00.541
because they refused
to advertise with Yelp.

54:01.412 --> 54:04.241
When I was the policy director
of the FTC,

54:04.284 --> 54:07.809
I used to be in charge
of the complaint intake unit.

54:08.332 --> 54:09.811
And I know what's
a lot of complaints,

54:11.552 --> 54:13.511
and 2,000 complaints is an astronomical number of complaints.

54:13.989 --> 54:16.688
Usually, in most matters,

54:16.731 --> 54:19.691
you're talking about
five, ten complaints.

54:20.387 --> 54:23.651
This was a real groundswell
of concern by businesses

54:23.695 --> 54:25.827
about the way Yelp
was running its business.

54:27.307 --> 54:30.658
[Sollitto] It's been investigated by the FTC twice,
and closed.

54:30.702 --> 54:32.007
So, I've killed
the thing dead

54:32.051 --> 54:33.835
six different ways
from Sunday.

54:34.706 --> 54:37.274
The closing of an
investigation does not mean

54:37.317 --> 54:39.624
that a company has received
a clean bill of health.

54:40.015 --> 54:43.541
The FTC actually brings a relatively small number of cases.

54:43.584 --> 54:46.283
Maybe something
like 15 to 20 a year.

54:46.326 --> 54:48.763
Maybe they saw
a law violation there,

54:48.807 --> 54:51.549
but said that they don't
have enough information

54:51.592 --> 54:54.160
to go to court
and prosecute Yelp.

54:54.203 --> 54:57.337
This might be an area
where the FTC is looking for,

54:57.381 --> 54:58.991
perhaps, the perfect case.

54:59.034 --> 55:02.777
So, even though Yelp's conduct could harm businesses

55:02.821 --> 55:04.083
and could be
anti-competitive,

55:04.649 --> 55:07.304
they could still choose
not to bring that case.

55:08.348 --> 55:10.394
There have certainly
been many cases

55:10.437 --> 55:12.526
in which the FTC
has failed to take action,

55:12.570 --> 55:15.703
which I thought that enforcement of action was appropriate.

55:17.618 --> 55:19.272
I find it really
difficult to believe

55:19.316 --> 55:21.492
that Yelp didn't know
about the investigation

55:21.535 --> 55:23.885
until they read about it
in the press.

55:23.929 --> 55:27.062
Then the staff believes that there's a problem in the market,

55:27.106 --> 55:30.327
they contact the parties
as soon as possible.

55:31.328 --> 55:33.678
When the Google
investigation was going on,

55:33.721 --> 55:37.159
they tried to be somewhat transparent about the algorithm.

55:37.421 --> 55:39.379
I don't think
Yelp's doing that.

55:39.423 --> 55:41.076
I think that's a suggestion

55:41.120 --> 55:43.383
that there's problematic
conduct there.

55:43.427 --> 55:44.863
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

55:49.041 --> 55:50.172
Is there a concern
on your part

55:50.216 --> 55:52.000
that there
is a perception even

55:52.044 --> 55:54.220
that there are unethical
practices going on?

55:54.263 --> 55:55.743
Well, we're not here
out of fear.

55:55.787 --> 55:57.310
We're here out of facts,
and making sure

55:57.354 --> 55:59.573
that they transcend
this conversation.

55:59.617 --> 56:02.576
Um, dismissing the FTC,
dismissing five federal judges

56:02.620 --> 56:04.404
who all found no wrongdoing.

56:04.448 --> 56:07.973
Dismissing an exhaustive
Harvard Business School study.

56:08.016 --> 56:10.410
Though dismissing all of that
seems a little weird,

56:10.454 --> 56:14.109
when all of it has very exhaustively debunked the claims.

56:14.153 --> 56:15.154
[Inaudible]

56:24.946 --> 56:26.948
I looked over
the Harvard Business study,

56:26.992 --> 56:29.690
and, in fact, I also looked
at a previous study

56:29.734 --> 56:32.606
done by one of
the same co-authors,

56:32.650 --> 56:34.173
also concerning Yelp.

56:35.870 --> 56:39.396
It's merely saying that there are some aspects of filtering

56:39.439 --> 56:41.223
that are predictable

56:41.267 --> 56:43.878
on the basis
of the economic position

56:43.922 --> 56:46.881
of the Boston restaurant
that's involved.

56:46.925 --> 56:49.449
But it's a limited study.
It's only restaurants.

56:49.710 --> 56:52.539
It's only in Boston.
It's only at a certain point in time.

56:53.714 --> 56:57.501
To argue that such a study
debunks anything is

56:57.544 --> 57:00.286
to jump to far more
of a conclusion

57:00.329 --> 57:02.244
than is really warranted

57:02.810 --> 57:05.465
from the amount of data,
and the breadth,

57:05.509 --> 57:07.032
and the findings even,

57:07.075 --> 57:08.686
of such a study.

57:08.729 --> 57:10.731
It's a working paper
at the moment.

57:10.775 --> 57:14.343
A working paper has not yet really been reviewed by peers,

57:14.735 --> 57:18.130
whereas a journal article is something that has been reviewed by peers,

57:18.173 --> 57:20.045
and gotten their
seal of approval.

57:21.307 --> 57:23.875
The focus was on reputation.

57:23.918 --> 57:28.053
They hypothesized that
restaurants that were

57:28.096 --> 57:31.186
in greater need of reputation
would have greater incentives

57:31.230 --> 57:33.145
to create fraudulent reviews.

57:33.188 --> 57:35.452
More or less, that's
what they found, as well.

57:35.887 --> 57:38.106
That chain restaurants,
for example,

57:38.150 --> 57:41.066
had very few reviews
that were filtered out,

57:41.109 --> 57:45.200
whereas restaurants that
were one-person operations

57:45.244 --> 57:48.987
and had very few reviews,
or bad reviews,

57:49.030 --> 57:52.991
were much more likely to have many reviews that were filtered out.

57:54.122 --> 57:55.863
The authors don't actually know whether they're fraudulent.

57:55.907 --> 57:57.561
They just know that
they're filtered by Yelp.

57:58.213 --> 58:00.564
So your research shows
whether you advertise or not

58:00.607 --> 58:02.783
has no bearing on how your reviews are filtered.

58:03.523 --> 58:05.394
What we're able to say is,

58:05.438 --> 58:08.659
something I would say
is slightly less strong.

58:08.702 --> 58:11.923
There could be some very complicated
process through which this happens.

58:11.966 --> 58:15.100
But there's so little transparency into what goes into these filters.

58:15.970 --> 58:18.886
And they said that they
didn't have any access

58:18.930 --> 58:20.671
to the algorithm
that Yelp uses.

58:21.193 --> 58:23.151
Yelp makes the algorithm

58:23.195 --> 58:25.240
difficult to reverse-engineer,

58:25.806 --> 58:27.416
for fairly obvious reasons,

58:27.460 --> 58:29.941
so not only did they
not have access to it,

58:29.984 --> 58:32.987
but they had no real means
of guessing

58:33.031 --> 58:35.903
as to what the algorithm,
in fact, was.

58:36.948 --> 58:38.558
[Sollitto] Frankly,
there's a Harvard Business School study

58:40.386 --> 58:41.866
that did an academic study that found that our software algorithm

58:43.607 --> 58:44.999
treats advertisers and non-advertiser reviews exactly the same.

58:45.043 --> 58:47.262
The study doesn't say
anything like that.

58:47.611 --> 58:51.092
It doesn't really even look at who advertises and who doesn't advertise.

58:51.615 --> 58:53.791
And, moreover, it really
can't make a judgement

58:53.834 --> 58:56.010
as to whether
any of the filters

58:56.054 --> 58:57.838
are fraudulent or not.

58:57.882 --> 59:00.319
It has to just take
Yelp's word for it.

59:00.362 --> 59:03.017
In fact, the study notes
that there are almost

59:03.061 --> 59:04.976
certainly errors
in the filtering,

59:05.019 --> 59:08.240
both false positives,
reviews that were perfectly

59:08.283 --> 59:10.764
reasonable and legitimate
that were filtered,

59:10.808 --> 59:13.593
and fraudulent reviews that made it through the system.

59:13.637 --> 59:14.681
But they can't tell.

59:16.727 --> 59:18.380
There are alternatives

59:18.424 --> 59:21.383
that are quite the opposite
of debunking this,

59:21.427 --> 59:23.385
that are also
completely consistent

59:23.429 --> 59:24.735
with the findings
of the authors.

59:36.181 --> 59:38.966
[Ramzi Abadou] There are various investigations into Yelp,
and have been.

59:40.272 --> 59:42.753
The Levitt case, which a lot
of people know about.

59:42.796 --> 59:45.843
There's another securities fraud class action that's pending,

59:45.886 --> 59:48.933
here in the Northern district of California,
called Curry v. Yelp.

59:48.976 --> 59:52.110
The allegations against Yelp
had to do with extortion.

59:52.153 --> 59:54.678
Every one of the clients

59:54.721 --> 59:58.812
had been threatened with harm if they didn't pay money.

59:58.856 --> 01:00:02.860
Cases were filed in Chicago
and LA, in Florida,

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:05.471
and they all got consolidated
in San Francisco.

01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:08.082
So I ended up
with all the cases.

01:00:08.387 --> 01:00:10.171
This is not
a smoking gun case.

01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:13.392
This is about a company
who, they admit,

01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:17.309
forced people to pay money
at the threat of harm.

01:00:17.352 --> 01:00:19.137
Now, that's extortion.

01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:22.749
If the mafia had done
what Yelp is doing,

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:24.708
they'd be thriving
in every county,

01:00:24.751 --> 01:00:27.145
in every jurisdiction
in the United States,

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:28.973
by doing it over the Internet.

01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:30.844
The Ninth Circuit said,

01:00:30.888 --> 01:00:33.673
"Under California law,
you can't win this case."

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:35.980
The California Supreme Court
has already ruled

01:00:36.023 --> 01:00:37.982
that this kind of conduct
is extortion.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:42.551
[Abadou] Much has been made
for the Levitt v. Yelp case.

01:00:42.595 --> 01:00:43.944
The Levitt case

01:00:43.988 --> 01:00:47.905
brought claims against Yelp
for civil extortion.

01:00:47.948 --> 01:00:52.257
Civil extortion claims are very,
very difficult to bring.

01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:56.609
It's important to really
look behind the veil,

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.350
and read the decisions,

01:00:58.393 --> 01:01:01.396
as opposed to just saying,
"Levitt v. Yelp was dismissed,

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.224
which means
we did nothing wrong."

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.531
That's certainly one way
to look at it.

01:01:05.574 --> 01:01:07.446
But when you
read the decision,

01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:08.752
there are certain
striking things,

01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:10.492
which is really
the court's sympathy

01:01:10.536 --> 01:01:11.929
for these small
business owners.

01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:15.715
"We emphasize
that we are not holding

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:18.587
that no cause of action exists

01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:20.851
that would cover conduct
such as that alleged,

01:01:20.894 --> 01:01:22.461
if adequately pled."

01:01:22.809 --> 01:01:25.594
It's another way of the court saying,
"There's something here,

01:01:25.638 --> 01:01:28.946
it's not civil extortion.
It may be breach of contract,

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:32.079
it may be a misrepresentation claim,
but there's something here."

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.734
Now, the court
didn't have to say that.

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:36.736
But the court does
mention its sympathy

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.346
for the plaintiff's complaint.

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.827
It just said, "You brought
a cause of action

01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:42.568
that is extremely
difficult to bring.

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:46.137
Because you have to demonstrate wrongful misconduct."

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.094
In the Levitt case,

01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:50.315
Yelp was represented by
a very big, powerful law firm,

01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:52.883
called Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

01:01:52.926 --> 01:01:55.537
The chairperson,
Edith Ramirez, of the FTC,

01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:58.105
was a former attorney
of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:01.369
I'm not saying that
anything untoward happened,

01:02:01.413 --> 01:02:04.982
but certainly the public raises an eyebrow, justifiably,

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:07.071
when they see
the cozy relationships

01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:09.682
between federal regulators,
like the FTC,

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.597
uh, and the private
defense bar.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:17.690
[Owens] You're seeing more and more of these stupid people

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.779
who somehow get
a bad rating on Yelp,

01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:22.521
and decide they're gonna sue the person that actually wrote the rating.

01:02:22.564 --> 01:02:24.653
How does Yelp deal
with something like that?

01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:26.351
[Sollitto] Well, we try
to help our consumers

01:02:26.394 --> 01:02:29.049
who do end up on the wrong end of these lawsuits.

01:02:29.093 --> 01:02:30.616
Um, I think many
small businesses

01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:33.227
kind of look for anything they can do, and, unfortunately,

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.839
trying to sue your customers
is not the best approach.

01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:37.579
Consumers do have
free speech rights

01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:39.320
to express themselves
and their opinions.

01:02:40.147 --> 01:02:42.976
My name is Chris Brody,
President of Crescendo Designs,

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.673
located in Southampton,
New York.

01:02:44.717 --> 01:02:46.588
We were hired by Matt Apfel,

01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:49.287
who is married
to Jackie Reses,

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:50.723
to, uh, install...

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.899
a control system
in their house.

01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:54.509
Did some audio, some TV,

01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:56.424
and, uh, speakers throughout.

01:02:57.164 --> 01:02:59.645
We put the system in.
They really had no problems.

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:01.125
Later on, um...

01:03:02.082 --> 01:03:04.302
With no cause of concern,

01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:06.086
or no call to us
of a problem,

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.827
I noticed a review on Yelp,

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:11.265
that, um, was a one-star
review for our company.

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:14.399
Yelp had to reveal to us
who the reviewer was,

01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:16.401
and it turned out
to be Jackie Reses,

01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:18.969
who was married
to Matt Apfel.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.058
[Reses on phone]

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:22.711
[Brody on phone] Hi, Jackie.

01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:33.870
[Playing classical music]

01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:40.311
[Kassman] In 2010,
somebody posted something

01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:43.662
that I felt was slander,
on Yelp,

01:04:43.705 --> 01:04:47.535
and so, I sued
in small claims court,

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:51.844
to have the particular terminology removed from the review.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.672
I subpoenaed records

01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:56.370
for all of the one-star
reviews between a certain day,

01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:59.199
because then his identity
would have been revealed.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.593
So they, of course,
rejected that,

01:05:01.636 --> 01:05:03.247
and wrote to the court
and said,

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.336
"No, you know, we won't comply
with the subpoena."

01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:08.556
And, further, they locked me
out of my Yelp account.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.778
I can't respond to any review
that's on Yelp.

01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:14.736
I can't edit our hours.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.826
I can't say we're on vacation.
I can't do anything.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:20.438
I can't access it in any way,
shape or form.

01:05:20.742 --> 01:05:23.136
And I'm sure Yelp's
response to that would be,

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:25.965
"Well, people shouldn't
have to, you know,

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:28.533
endanger their privacy
to leave a review."

01:05:28.576 --> 01:05:31.840
Yeah, they should.
If you're putting someone's job on the line,

01:05:31.884 --> 01:05:33.712
if you're putting someone's
reputation on the line,

01:05:33.755 --> 01:05:35.670
you should have
accountability at that.

01:05:35.714 --> 01:05:37.237
It shouldn't be
a free-for-all.

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:39.500
It shouldn't be like,
"I can write whatever I want

01:05:39.544 --> 01:05:41.502
and you're never gonna know
it's me, ha-ha!"

01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:44.810
Even though I'm locked
out of my account,

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:46.943
and I can't respond
to reviews,

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:49.380
they still called me to ask me if I would advertise with them.

01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:52.078
Hey, good morning.
This is Jocelyn over here at Yelp.

01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:54.211
I'm calling in regards
to your Yelp needs.

01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:56.474
I would love to talk
to the owner,

01:05:56.517 --> 01:06:00.260
in terms of the activity that's been going on in your current success.

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:02.306
So go ahead... Go ahead
and give me a call back.

01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:04.003
I'm excited to chat with you.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.700
I've used Yelp reviews.

01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:08.355
I've contributed any number
of Yelp reviews.

01:06:08.399 --> 01:06:11.793
I'm a certifie...
Registered Yelp user.

01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:15.928
And up until my experience

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.017
with you, Russell,
I trusted Yelp.

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:23.370
It did not occur to me that anybody would be manipulating that

01:06:23.414 --> 01:06:26.460
to lead someone
to think that,

01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:29.898
you know, the actual tide
of public opinion

01:06:29.942 --> 01:06:33.337
said something other than
what was really the case.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.819
I sat down and typed
a really long review

01:06:37.863 --> 01:06:40.866
talking about the care that you took,
and I so appreciated it.

01:06:40.909 --> 01:06:43.912
It's not abusive. It's not...
You didn't pay me to do it.

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:47.046
I was a genuine customer,
and I was offended.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.788
[Chuckles] I felt like somebody had questioned my credibility.

01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:53.052
I started calling law firms
up in the city,

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:55.968
because there are a bunch of them that take class-action suits,

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:58.753
and I started saying,
"This has got to be wrong."

01:06:58.797 --> 01:07:00.581
And one lawyer said,

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:04.411
"Well, they are going to
hide behind the immunity

01:07:04.455 --> 01:07:08.067
provided to online
review providers,

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.504
under the
Communications Decency Act."

01:07:11.157 --> 01:07:12.680
[McManus] The Communications
Decency Act

01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:15.640
was actually passed in 1995.

01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:18.904
When Congress protected

01:07:20.601 --> 01:07:23.343
Internet service providers through Section 230 of the CDA,

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:28.957
they meant to protect people who were just passing information through.

01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:32.091
In other words,
like Prodigy or...

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:34.833
currently, like Verizon
or Time Warner,

01:07:34.876 --> 01:07:37.140
they can't know what's
going through their pipeline,

01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:39.403
and Congress
very reasonably said,

01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:41.100
"You can't be
responsible for that."

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:43.537
What Congress meant
was to protect people

01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:45.670
who were just sending
things through a pipeline.

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:49.630
What's happened now
is that people like Yelp,

01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:52.024
and other service providers,
have been redefined

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.200
not by Congress,
but by the courts,

01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:56.724
as being Internet
service providers.

01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:58.900
People who are
access providers...

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.688
are simply people who allow people to get online.

01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:07.779
Those who moderate
the content of their sites

01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:09.172
have more responsibility.

01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:10.869
The courts are not
making that distinction,

01:08:10.912 --> 01:08:14.786
and that's the challenge
CDA presents for people today.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:18.094
False speech
is protected by CDA

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.357
as the law
is currently interpreted.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:23.142
They made such an enemy
of their businesses.

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:24.709
Instead of saying,
"Hey, we're hearing you.

01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:26.189
We understand
you're having problems,"

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.322
they created a problem with businesses trying to protect themselves

01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:31.585
and then punish
the businesses for doing it.

01:08:33.412 --> 01:08:34.805
In the Nielsen Report,

01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:38.157
they say that 41 % of the people are
more likely to leave a negative review.

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:39.724
So we have to ask people

01:08:40.028 --> 01:08:41.421
to leave positive reviews.

01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:43.902
If we don't ask them
to leave positive reviews,

01:08:43.944 --> 01:08:45.555
they're just gonna
come on and complain.

01:08:47.035 --> 01:08:48.515
In the real world,
before Yelp,

01:08:48.559 --> 01:08:50.300
we had comment cards on tables.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.911
We had surveys,
we would send newsletters out and ask,

01:08:52.953 --> 01:08:55.087
"Please let us know what we're doing right or wrong."

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.828
And I think
the misconception with Yelp

01:08:58.090 --> 01:08:59.917
is that they feel,

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:01.746
"We just don't want
any negative reviews."

01:09:01.788 --> 01:09:04.051
That's not true.
Businesses will tell you,

01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:05.618
"We don't mind
the negative reviews.

01:09:05.662 --> 01:09:07.143
We want to hear
what we're doing wrong."

01:09:07.752 --> 01:09:10.798
What we don't like is that
that's all that's there.

01:09:12.017 --> 01:09:13.540
[Abadou] The company
went public

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:16.108
to much hype
and fanfare in 2012.

01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:20.982
Insiders between 2013
and 2014 at the company,

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:24.682
including the CEO,
sold $81 million worth of stock,

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:28.337
at prices as high as $100.

01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:31.906
I think the stock is
currently trading at $45.

01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:34.212
So this is a company,
that, for whatever reason,

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:35.693
is struggling right now.

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.479
And rather than embracing people who criticize the company,

01:09:39.523 --> 01:09:41.089
perhaps justifiably,

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:43.527
and engaging in
a dialogue with them,

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:46.573
what they do is they take
their victories in court,

01:09:46.617 --> 01:09:49.359
which I view as very limited,

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:51.143
and say,
"See, we haven't done

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.798
and we're not doing
anything wrong."

01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:57.062
One of the problems, I think,
with what Yelp is doing

01:09:57.105 --> 01:10:00.152
is the way they criticize
people who criticize Yelp.

01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:03.242
Calling people
who criticize the company,

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:04.809
"fringe commentators,"

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.552
that's specifically from Aaron Schur,
the head of litigation.

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:12.338
I don't think that's fair.
I don't think it's constructive.

01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:15.515
And I think it's a mistake
to call small business owners

01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:17.648
who are trying
to make a living,

01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:21.260
despite Yelp's influence,
"fringe commentators."

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:24.176
- [Barking]
- [Vitol] I'm really curious what percentage

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.179
of Yelp's revenues came
from small businesses.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:30.661
I mean, if they're willing
to treat us so poorly,

01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:33.533
maybe we didn't represent a significant amount of revenue for them,

01:10:33.577 --> 01:10:35.361
and I looked up
their public company,

01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:40.018
I looked up their financials,
85 % of their revenues come from small businesses.

01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:45.763
Fifty-three percent of
their total expenses, yearly,

01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:47.634
are spent on sales people,

01:10:47.678 --> 01:10:50.768
specifically to target
the small business segment.

01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:51.943
They're a sales company.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:53.640
They're a marketing company.

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:55.207
They're not a review company.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.078
They're just out
to make sales.

01:10:57.905 --> 01:11:01.213
[Teran] What I decided to do to take orders into my own hand,

01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:04.608
I created a blog
to let people know

01:11:04.651 --> 01:11:06.871
what was happening
to our Yelp page.

01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:10.396
Where you can insert the name of your restaurant on your Yelp page,

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.702
I would delete that,

01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:13.443
and insert it
with the website.

01:11:13.486 --> 01:11:14.618
People would read it,

01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:17.273
'cause people who would come into the restaurant later in the week

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:19.449
would say, "Hey, I saw
what happened to your page.

01:11:19.797 --> 01:11:21.538
It's really a shame."

01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:25.585
A writer from Fortune.com
decided to write an article

01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:27.979
about what was
going on with Yelp,

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:30.155
and use my blog

01:11:30.198 --> 01:11:32.113
on her write-up that
she did for the magazine.

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:36.248
It made me feel good that
my voice was being heard,

01:11:37.467 --> 01:11:39.425
because, at that point,
no one was listening to me.

01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:45.257
And I decided to use that
as leverage

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.304
towards my sales
representative from Yelp,

01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:50.349
and let them know like,
"Hey, listen,

01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:52.046
you guys have done
nothing for me.

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:55.485
You guys let me suffer here
for a while now,

01:11:55.528 --> 01:11:56.790
and nothing's being done.

01:11:57.225 --> 01:11:58.966
It's time for me
to do something

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.012
if you guys
are not gonna help."

01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:04.450
Legit, three days after

01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:07.366
posting that I was
on Fortune.com,

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.976
everything was gone
from my account.

01:12:09.586 --> 01:12:12.850
After four or five months
of this being on my page,

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:14.330
the alert wasn't there
anymore.

01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.942
Our account was clean again.

01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:21.685
Emergency!
I would like a table,

01:12:21.728 --> 01:12:24.252
inside the area with all the little plastic balls please,

01:12:24.296 --> 01:12:26.472
and make it snappy,
I'm a food critic for Yelp.

01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:29.214
That does it!
I've had enough!

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:32.304
All you Yelp reviewers
get the hell out of here!

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.089
I don't care what happens
to my business.

01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:37.265
I ain't kissing
your asses no more!

01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:40.268
- [Chair scraping]
- Go on.

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:42.967
Every Yelper,
get the [bleep] out of here!

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:45.665
Whistlin' Willy,
he stand up to the Yelpers!

01:12:46.579 --> 01:12:48.842
We don't have to kiss
their asses anymore!

01:12:48.886 --> 01:12:50.409
Look, everybody
doing the same!

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:52.977
[Laughs] It's over! It's over!

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.240
Hey, Skeeter,
you hear the news?

01:12:55.283 --> 01:12:57.024
It's a miracle.

01:12:57.068 --> 01:12:59.113
It's a miracle!

01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:09.907
[Cerretini] What I did is start a percent off for one-star review,

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:11.952
for the only reason,
to screw them.

01:13:11.996 --> 01:13:14.085
There was no other
reason to do it.

01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:16.740
I'd much rather
to pay my customer,

01:13:16.783 --> 01:13:19.656
it's gonna cost me more
than $300 a month,

01:13:19.699 --> 01:13:23.834
but I much rather to give
my customer a discount,

01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:25.401
to give them
the middle finger,

01:13:25.444 --> 01:13:27.881
than be forced to pay
a protection fee to them.

01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:32.451
We could not even imagine

01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:36.324
the success that had the campaign of the one-star review.

01:13:36.542 --> 01:13:38.109
We got the attention
of the media.

01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:40.851
We went in
Time magazine, USA Today,

01:13:41.155 --> 01:13:44.594
Important people in Italy,
France, Spain, Qatar,

01:13:44.637 --> 01:13:46.291
the response was great.

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:49.729
We got 2,300 reviews
in just a few days.

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.384
The success was unbelievable.

01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:56.475
Well, I gave the middle finger to them,
and I got one star only,

01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:58.346
and increased
the business for 40 %.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:00.218
[Reporter] Business is booming.

01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:02.699
They racked up eight pages
of new reviews

01:14:02.742 --> 01:14:04.309
in less than 48 hours,

01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:06.180
most of them one-star ratings

01:14:06.224 --> 01:14:08.139
with snarky
or positive comments,

01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:11.142
ranging from, "My food
arrived before I wanted it,"

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:12.622
to, "Love the campaign,"

01:14:12.665 --> 01:14:14.232
and, "You earned
a new customer."

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.673
[Lane] There has to be
some accountability

01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:22.414
for what you're gonna
put on Yelp,

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.242
and what you're not
gonna put on Yelp.

01:14:24.285 --> 01:14:25.417
It seems to be

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.072
there's some secret
mystical algorithm

01:14:28.115 --> 01:14:31.336
that's on, like, Dr.
Moreau's island in the middle of nowhere,

01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:33.077
and they're the only ones
who know about it,

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.948
but it's totally legit.

01:14:34.992 --> 01:14:36.689
Well, that's not working,

01:14:36.733 --> 01:14:38.778
and if it means that
you have to hire people

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:40.171
to sit down and read reviews

01:14:40.214 --> 01:14:42.478
that people flag
as offensive or whatever,

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:45.089
there's obviously some kind
of inherent failure

01:14:45.132 --> 01:14:46.569
in the way that it's set up,

01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:49.963
and it would be
responsible for them

01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:52.749
to really understand
the impact

01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:56.448
that their reviews have
on people, on businesses,

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.885
on consumers, because
consumers have changed

01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:02.019
the way that they approach
restaurants since Yelp.

01:15:02.367 --> 01:15:05.457
And, yes,
it's good that there's somewhere we can go,

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:08.982
and we can say that, you know,
"The service was really rude,

01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:12.246
I found a cockroach in my food,
this is really bad."

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:13.770
But at the same time,

01:15:13.813 --> 01:15:18.426
if you give people so much
of a sense of entitlement,

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:20.516
there's gonna be abuse.

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:22.735
And it's your responsibility,

01:15:22.779 --> 01:15:25.259
you created the monster,
you need to contain the monster.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.698
I think the biggest thing
that Yelp could do

01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:31.570
is to issue a formal public apology basically saying,

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.050
"Look, guys, we messed up.

01:15:34.834 --> 01:15:35.487
We didn't necessarily create the product that we had hoped to,

01:15:36.706 --> 01:15:37.228
we're gonna go back
to the drawing board

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.360
and we're gonna start
adding some validation."

01:15:41.058 --> 01:15:41.972
So that when someone comes in and does business with a company,

01:15:43.234 --> 01:15:44.931
and they're ecstatic
or they're aggravated,

01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:47.847
they can go and validate that that was a legitimate transaction

01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:48.892
and post their feedback.

01:15:50.502 --> 01:15:52.243
Without that,
I feel like Yelp is misleading the public,

01:15:52.286 --> 01:15:54.941
because they're saying,
"These are real reviews by real people,"

01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:56.856
but on the other hand,
on the back end,

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.729
they don't require you
to have a real identity,

01:15:59.772 --> 01:16:02.862
a transaction,
or have ever gone to that business establishment.

01:16:02.906 --> 01:16:05.604
Yelp, right now, operates
as an advertising company

01:16:05.648 --> 01:16:07.171
and not a review company,

01:16:07.214 --> 01:16:09.608
and if they shifted gears
into a review company,

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:11.610
I think that would be...
Priority number one

01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:13.569
is making sure
we actually have reviews.

01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:15.440
Real reviews by real people.

01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:18.791
It's like Yelp
has created a fire,

01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:21.228
and they're selling the water
to put it out.

01:16:22.055 --> 01:16:24.057
Thousands, and I mean it,

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:25.885
thousands of businesses,

01:16:25.929 --> 01:16:27.757
they reach out to us,

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.107
through e-mail,
through phone call, uh,

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:32.544
it's unbelievable
what I heard from people.

01:16:32.892 --> 01:16:34.938
Not many people
can do what we do.

01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:36.635
You need the right attitude,

01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:39.377
you need the right customers,

01:16:40.247 --> 01:16:43.163
and you need to be
established for many years.

01:16:43.207 --> 01:16:44.382
Yelp knows that.

01:16:46.036 --> 01:16:47.907
All you have to do is get the right champion in Congress

01:16:47.951 --> 01:16:49.648
to be able to carry it through

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:51.345
and do the right thing.

01:16:51.389 --> 01:16:53.347
That's where the law
can be changed,

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:55.349
very slightly,
very incrementally,

01:16:55.393 --> 01:16:57.003
it doesn't have
to be cataclysmic,

01:16:57.047 --> 01:16:58.614
it doesn't have to go
to the Supreme Court.

01:16:58.657 --> 01:16:59.832
Just take this law,

01:17:01.268 --> 01:17:02.748
look back and see where
Congress intended it to be.

01:17:03.444 --> 01:17:05.011
Protecting the pipeline,

01:17:05.055 --> 01:17:07.753
not the people who are at the other end of that pipeline,

01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:09.886
and then manipulating it
to make a profit.

01:17:09.929 --> 01:17:12.192
The importance of this film

01:17:12.236 --> 01:17:15.152
is to build awareness
that it's happening.

01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:18.111
And if it hasn't happened
to you yet, it may.

01:17:18.155 --> 01:17:19.460
It's up to you to decide.

01:17:19.504 --> 01:17:21.027
You wanna be Botto Bistro,

01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:23.943
or you wanna be a coward
that pay their protection fee?

01:17:24.596 --> 01:17:26.729
[Vitol] If every
small business in America

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:28.774
decided to boycott
Yelp tomorrow...

01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:31.951
it might get their attention.

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:34.650
[Cerretini] We became
a voice for the people

01:17:34.693 --> 01:17:36.695
that, actually, until now,
they didn't have it.

01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:39.480
'Cause nobody listen
to the business. Nobody.

01:17:40.307 --> 01:17:42.832
We are glad
that we did our part

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:45.573
to open their eyes.
Nobody like to see

01:17:45.617 --> 01:17:49.055
a $10 billion corporation
controlling this little guy.

01:17:49.577 --> 01:17:52.624
Here, we have ten tables.
We are hard-working people.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:56.106
And our intention is not to pay a penny for a better rating.

01:17:56.367 --> 01:17:57.890
If tomorrow,

01:17:58.499 --> 01:18:01.502
hundreds of business,
they start to do what we do,

01:18:01.546 --> 01:18:03.417
Yelp will last two days,

01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:05.637
because they have
no power over you.

01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:17.753
Excuse me...

01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:23.280
We have questions for you.

01:19:26.892 --> 01:19:28.807
We could have lunch.

01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:29.895
Oh, fabulous.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.508
[Woman 1] Vince,
could you answer a few questions?

01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:37.207
[Woman 2] I don't think
he wants to talk to us.

01:20:30.086 --> 01:20:31.609
[Man] There's a guy
recording us right there.

01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:33.089
- [Woman] There is?
- [Man] Through that door.

01:20:33.132 --> 01:20:34.786
[Woman] Yeah, it's through
the door to the left.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.657
Excuse me,
do you guys work for Yelp?

01:20:39.399 --> 01:20:41.880
Hi, excuse me.
Do you work for Yelp?

01:20:41.924 --> 01:20:42.707
Uh, yeah.

01:20:44.578 --> 01:20:45.101
- Would you mind answering a couple of questions?
- No, I can't. Sorry.

01:20:46.493 --> 01:20:47.886
Hi, do you guys
work for Yelp?

01:20:48.147 --> 01:20:49.061
Uh...

01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:51.237
- Hi, I see you work for Yelp.
- Yeah.

01:20:51.281 --> 01:20:53.283
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

01:20:53.326 --> 01:20:55.328
- Uh, sure.
- Oh, awesome.

01:20:55.372 --> 01:20:56.895
- Thank you.
- Oh.

01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:59.115
- What do you do for Yelp?
- I can't talk.

01:20:59.158 --> 01:21:00.290
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.334
Thanks.

01:21:03.075 --> 01:21:03.946
So, around the corner,
you see him telling people to go away.

01:21:05.338 --> 01:21:06.383
We'd love to have the chance
to speak with Yelp?

01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:09.038
Uh, if you guys would be willing to answer some questions

01:21:10.387 --> 01:21:11.605
regarding the claims made
by business owners.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.304
Yeah, I don't think anyone's gonna come down and talk to anybody today.

01:21:14.652 --> 01:21:15.740
Okay, could you talk to us?

01:21:17.263 --> 01:21:18.177
- No, I can't. I can't do that, sorry.
- Why is that?

01:21:18.221 --> 01:21:19.613
- Huh?
- Why not?

01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:21.572
Because it's not my job.

01:21:21.615 --> 01:21:22.790
What is your job?

01:21:25.054 --> 01:21:27.186
You're not just
a door holder, are you?

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:28.448
[Man] Yes.
