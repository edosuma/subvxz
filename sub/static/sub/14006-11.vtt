00:01.540 --> 00:03.280
Previously on Damages...

00:03.290 --> 00:04.520
Did you get any word from patty?

00:04.530 --> 00:06.130
I've told her that she's
got to come back here.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.689
She doesn't want to come back.

00:07.700 --> 00:11.530
You think patty tried to
kill you to protect herself?

00:11.540 --> 00:14.340
I am trying to settle this case.

00:14.350 --> 00:15.230
Try harder.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.860
She's divorcing me.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.660
Maybe I'll tell him about
you and gregory malina.

00:18.670 --> 00:21.040
Give me five minutes,ray.

00:21.050 --> 00:24.300
I think george moore engineered
this whole hit- and-run.

00:24.310 --> 00:26.810
I think he leaked arlington
to get you to settle.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.660
George moore made a big show
of going after frobisher.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.100
But you didn't believe he was?

00:31.110 --> 00:33.110
I could get killed for what I told you.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.290
If there's a connection between you
and arthur frobisher,we will find it.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.350
I spoke with george moore.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.980
How could you be so stupid?

00:39.990 --> 00:42.450
Don't bother coming back.

00:43.740 --> 00:46.070
Thanks for the advice...

00:46.080 --> 00:48.540
but I guess I won't be
needing this anymore.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.250
What happened?

00:50.260 --> 00:52.820
I told her I was sick of her bullshit.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.050
You what?

00:54.060 --> 00:56.910
Ellen,you're a first-year associate.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.330
When patty was my age,do you think she
would have tolerated a boss like her?

01:00.340 --> 01:01.460
No.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.630
Then why should I?

01:03.640 --> 01:05.810
Was this about the case?

01:05.820 --> 01:07.090
Sort of.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.540
I uncovered some evidence on my own...

01:09.550 --> 01:12.740
But patty was more interested in
putting me in my place than what I found.

01:12.750 --> 01:14.300
I see,mm-hmm.

01:14.310 --> 01:17.140
She says it's all about
the case,but it's not.

01:17.150 --> 01:19.000
It's about her and her mind games.

01:19.010 --> 01:20.130
Yes.

01:20.140 --> 01:23.320
I want the clients to
win their case,but...

01:23.330 --> 01:25.260
I'm not going to be
patty's punching bag.

01:25.270 --> 01:27.780
Oh,you'll bounce back.

01:27.790 --> 01:30.550
Which is why I'm here,mr.Nye.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.360
I need a job.

01:34.090 --> 01:37.120
The law will always be here,ellen.

01:37.130 --> 01:40.230
But,um,your wedding
is coming up,isn't it?

01:40.240 --> 01:41.690
Yes.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.120
You know,I made similar
mistakes early in my career.

01:45.130 --> 01:47.600
Never took a honeymoon.

01:47.610 --> 01:51.340
Don't let your life pass you by.

Babe,this is a nightmare.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.380
What is?

03:45.390 --> 03:46.670
The seating arrangement.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.770
It's more complicated than the bar exam.

03:50.780 --> 03:54.680
Can I sit your cousin
jake next to heather?

03:54.690 --> 03:56.980
Why are you always trying
to pimp heather out,huh?

03:56.990 --> 03:58.940
I just thought,you know,they both...

03:58.950 --> 04:00.030
they both love hiking...

04:00.040 --> 04:02.520
and narcotics.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.240
they have lots to talk about.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.420
How'd it go with nye?

04:06.430 --> 04:08.500
He wouldn't give me a job.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.670
He told me to take a vacation.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.770
I love this man.

04:14.990 --> 04:17.829
All right,I will see you later.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.480
- Okay?
- Okay.

04:23.620 --> 04:24.990
Hello,david.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.960
Patty.

04:28.910 --> 04:31.190
May I come in?

04:41.160 --> 04:43.810
Do you want to call me later?

04:43.820 --> 04:46.550
Yeah. I will.

04:54.730 --> 04:57.390
I was wondering when you would show up.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.800
You impressed me with this.

05:03.810 --> 05:05.720
I wasn't trying to.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.230
Just take the information and use it.

05:11.310 --> 05:15.430
It's all very intriguing,but
how does it help our case?

05:15.440 --> 05:20.050
George moore was heading up the sec
investigation into frobisher's company,

05:20.060 --> 05:22.500
but according to a
former sec investigator...

05:22.510 --> 05:23.700
Laura watkins.

05:23.710 --> 05:24.720
I met with her.

05:24.730 --> 05:28.270
She believed that moore was making a big
show of wanting to take down frobisher,

05:28.280 --> 05:31.880
but behind the scenes he was
torpedoing the investigation.

05:31.890 --> 05:33.850
And all the
rest of this--

05:33.860 --> 05:37.380
the hotel records,the rental
car receipts,a flight manifest...

05:37.390 --> 05:40.890
All show that george moore
was in jacksonville,florida

05:40.900 --> 05:43.530
the weekend before
frobisher sold his stock.

05:43.540 --> 05:47.910
Moore drove down to palm
beach to tip off frobisher.

05:49.730 --> 05:51.970
It's a nice theory.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.270
No proof.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.000
Use it anyway.

05:56.010 --> 05:57.630
Put pressure on moore.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.130
To do what?

05:59.140 --> 06:01.330
Get frobisher to settle.

06:01.340 --> 06:04.190
I could never understand
why moore leaked arlington,

06:04.200 --> 06:06.840
but now it makes perfect sense.

06:06.850 --> 06:09.900
He must be afraid of what
would come out in a trial.

06:09.910 --> 06:14.450
Moore wants the whole case to go away,and
if he knows that you're closing in on him...

06:14.460 --> 06:18.320
He'll give us more dirt we
can use against frobisher.

06:20.190 --> 06:22.450
So...

06:23.070 --> 06:25.590
we need to go back to moore.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.330
I think so.

06:29.340 --> 06:33.730
And you're the only lawyer
in my firm he'll talk to.

06:42.060 --> 06:44.630
It's a nice apartment.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.040
Isn't it?

06:54.660 --> 06:56.530
Go back to moore.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.670
And...

07:04.680 --> 07:09.370
of course you can have your job back.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.770
I don't want it.

07:14.450 --> 07:17.170
But I'll talk to moore.

07:17.550 --> 07:20.330
I want you to win this case.

07:23.980 --> 07:27.090
Our court date--
six weeks,folks.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.100
Tom's running point,so if he
needs you to do something,do it.

07:31.110 --> 07:32.670
Exhibits,witness prep.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.570
It is deadline time.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.700
Felicia,do you have the expert list?

07:37.710 --> 07:39.630
You'll get it tomorrow.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.680
That's it.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.100
Make your mothers proud.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.680
- Where was ellen this morning?
- I don't know.

07:47.690 --> 07:48.650
Maybe she wasn't feeling well.

07:48.660 --> 07:51.080
Tom,half the office saw
her storm out the other day.

07:51.090 --> 07:51.970
Did patty fire her?

07:51.980 --> 07:54.500
Just focus on the case.

07:54.510 --> 07:55.600
Everyone's talking about it.

07:55.610 --> 07:56.870
- What are we supposed to tell them?
- Whatever you want.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.260
Tell them ellen's dead.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.960
Just get me the goddamn expert list.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.640
I hope she was fired.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.190
I never liked her.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.820
Ray?

08:10.830 --> 08:11.970
Hey.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.940
What are you doing here?

08:13.950 --> 08:16.680
I thought you could use some lunch.

08:18.020 --> 08:19.520
what do we got here?

08:19.530 --> 08:23.590
A nice filet,some asparagus,and
some blackberry cobbler.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.930
sweetie,this is stupendous.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.430
I finished my meetings this morning,

08:27.440 --> 08:30.480
and i just realized
how much I missed you.

08:30.490 --> 08:33.630
I know,I know,I'm sorry.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.240
This case has just taken over my life.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.980
They all do,ray,but this one...

08:40.789 --> 08:43.179
this one's different.

08:43.669 --> 08:46.250
I worry about you.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.280
You're so quiet these days.

08:49.290 --> 08:50.460
what?

08:50.470 --> 08:52.660
You never accused me of that before.

08:52.670 --> 08:54.700
Well,it's true.

08:54.930 --> 08:59.050
Soon as the case is over,I'll be
a regular ol' chatterbox again.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.710
Well,that'll be nice.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.730
We'll take a few days,go
see your sister in tacoma.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.380
I'll believe that when I see it.

09:06.390 --> 09:08.040
I promise.

09:08.050 --> 09:10.490
Sit,sit,eat.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.920
Oh,that smells good.

More wine?

09:26.630 --> 09:28.220
Why not?

09:29.390 --> 09:32.160
We're going to be closing soon,so...

09:34.480 --> 09:36.780
Looks like I'm your last customer.

09:36.790 --> 09:40.450
I suppose I just lost track of the time.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.890
You're always coming in here
with work. What do you do?

09:42.900 --> 09:44.780
I'm an attorney.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.920
You know,I don't believe
I've ever caught your name.

09:48.930 --> 09:49.850
Greg.

09:49.860 --> 09:51.290
Ray.

09:56.070 --> 09:57.770
A blackout?

09:58.150 --> 10:00.680
You were probably still in kindergarten.

10:00.690 --> 10:05.810
This was 1977,the very
first week I arrived.

10:06.380 --> 10:09.580
An auspicious debut. Shit.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.660
Guess when I got here.

10:11.670 --> 10:12.840
When?

10:12.850 --> 10:15.120
Last september.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.970
You don't say. Yeah.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.420
Before or after?

10:18.430 --> 10:20.230
Just before.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.450
It almost made my change my
mind,but then I thought...

10:23.480 --> 10:25.700
if I leave now...

10:25.710 --> 10:28.220
They win. Right.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.080
I probably should have left,though.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.160
Why's that?

10:32.170 --> 10:33.690
I don't know,I...

10:34.140 --> 10:35.770
I just can'T...

10:35.780 --> 10:37.930
get going,you know?

10:37.940 --> 10:42.460
I live in a shithole,and i
barely make enough to pay my rent.

10:43.790 --> 10:46.870
Why did you decide to move
here in the first place?

10:47.360 --> 10:49.710
I'll try anything once,I guess.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.000
Oh,I'm sorry.

10:58.590 --> 11:00.050
That's my wife.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.610
You're married?

11:01.620 --> 11:03.380
Never seen her; you never bring her in.

11:03.390 --> 11:08.380
Oh,I come in here to work,clear my head.

11:09.020 --> 11:11.910
You like being an attorney?

11:11.920 --> 11:16.720
I like the relationship
between attorney and client.

11:17.950 --> 11:22.860
There's an intimacy there,a trust.

11:23.290 --> 11:28.010
Someone puts himself in your hands.

11:29.050 --> 11:31.060
And you like that.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.050
I do.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.390
What the hell are you doing here?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.850
Oh,uh,a couple downstairs
said the ceiling was dripping.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.820
Just,um...

11:57.830 --> 11:59.720
checking for a leak.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.770
And the lamp?

12:08.190 --> 12:10.360
Noticed a bulb was out.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.310
Does ellen know that you're here?

12:14.320 --> 12:15.760
No.

12:16.490 --> 12:19.890
Patty hewes told me to
extra special care of you.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.760
Next time,you call me.

12:30.860 --> 12:33.340
Don't ever do this again.

12:38.060 --> 12:39.430
6 DAYS LATER

12:39.440 --> 12:43.360
You have 57 new messages.

12:43.370 --> 12:45.470
Patty,it's tom.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.800
it's tom.

12:48.910 --> 12:51.800
I'm in rome now.I'm worried about you...

12:52.560 --> 12:54.440
it's tom...

12:55.380 --> 12:57.840
Yeah,mom,I'm up at
henry'S.Everything's fine...

12:58.850 --> 13:00.170
I don't know how to tell you this.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.540
I just got a call from hollis nye.

13:02.550 --> 13:05.030
Somehow,ellen's in jail.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.670
I don't know how to tell you this.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.150
I just got a call from hollis nye.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.390
Somehow,ellen's in jail.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.120
She was arrested for killing david.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
How was sawgrass?

14:06.520 --> 14:07.760
I'm sorry?

14:07.770 --> 14:10.910
Did you hit the green on
17 or end up in the drink?

14:10.920 --> 14:12.970
Depends on when you're talking about.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.190
June,2002.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.990
You were in jacksonville,florida the
weekend before frobisher dumped his stock.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.670
Ah,yes.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.970
I hit the green.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.980
I'm sure you did.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.910
Then you drove four hours to palm
beach and tipped off frobisher that

14:27.920 --> 14:32.910
the sec was about to release a
report damning his company's finances.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.800
Frobisher give you a nice kickback?

14:34.810 --> 14:37.880
I was trying to prosecute
arthur frobisher.

14:37.890 --> 14:40.840
Not according to laura watkins.

14:42.070 --> 14:43.050
Look,I don't know what you think...

14:43.060 --> 14:44.870
I think you want this case to be over,

14:44.880 --> 14:47.180
and i think that we can help each other.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.170
Give us something on frobisher.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.040
And if I don't?

14:51.050 --> 14:54.600
Then patty hewes
starts looking into you.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.990
Your finances,your
investments,your bank accounts--

14:58.000 --> 15:00.910
anything you have hidden,she'll find it.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.590
I told you,I can't give you frobisher.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.010
But I can give you somebody.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.830
Who?

15:06.840 --> 15:09.690
Same time,tomorrow night,meet me here.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.180
I'll bring you a present.

15:56.870 --> 15:58.530
Jesus...

16:00.610 --> 16:02.270
you scared me.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.670
You're so cute when you
think you're alone. Yeah?

16:07.370 --> 16:09.790
Ugh,I'm living life in reverse.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.390
First breakfast then bed.

16:15.270 --> 16:16.620
What's that?

16:16.630 --> 16:19.330
It's our first wedding gift.

16:19.340 --> 16:23.030
Don't get too excited,though. It's
from aunt marge and uncle fran.

16:25.670 --> 16:28.150
A garden gnome?

16:28.850 --> 16:30.990
We live in an apartment.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.650
Thank god your family has some taste.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.560
What did patty have to say?

16:37.570 --> 16:40.620
She offered me my job back.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.930
What did you say?

16:42.940 --> 16:44.980
I said no.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.260
Good.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.140
I don't like having her in our lives.

16:50.150 --> 16:52.330
Neither do I.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.700
- You want breakfast?
- Sure

16:55.330 --> 16:57.260
Aw,no.

16:57.270 --> 16:58.680
Who is it?

16:58.690 --> 16:59.960
Lila dimeo.

16:59.970 --> 17:02.050
Don't answer it.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.880
But this is the third time
she's called this week.

17:04.890 --> 17:08.920
Well,we need do something.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.800
We need to talk.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.890
How did it go with judge toomey?

17:21.900 --> 17:24.770
Patty,when are you going
to announce ellen's firing?

17:24.780 --> 17:29.060
I'm-I'm-I'm running around the
office,avoiding people's questions...

17:29.740 --> 17:30.810
And?

17:30.820 --> 17:34.380
And I'm a partner now,and I
need you to treat me like one.

17:34.390 --> 17:37.930
If you have plans for
ellen,i need to know them.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.540
There are no plans.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.780
Then you should tell
the associates that.

17:41.790 --> 17:46.660
Ellen approached a key informant
without our knowledge,and she was fired.

17:46.670 --> 17:48.490
People should know that.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.780
Go announce it.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.190
Thank you.

17:56.270 --> 17:57.980
And,tom?

17:59.520 --> 18:04.810
You're right,you're a partner,i
should start treating you like one.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.020
Goddamn it,gregory,you had one task.

18:36.030 --> 18:38.320
One task,and you screwed it up.

18:38.330 --> 18:40.430
How was I supposed to know the
guy was gonna show up early?

18:40.440 --> 18:42.350
You shouldn't have been in
the condo in the first place.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.380
You were supposed to rent it,leave
the key,and take a goddamn vacation.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.360
I'm sorry,ray.

18:47.370 --> 18:50.790
But I'm telling you,the
girl didn't see anything.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.400
The important thing now
is for you to say nothing.

18:55.410 --> 18:58.630
You just forget any of this
ever happened,understand?

18:58.640 --> 19:00.410
Yes,I understand.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.830
Look,I'm sorry for
raising my voice at you...

19:05.840 --> 19:06.740
It's my fault.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.380
I-I screwed up.

19:09.780 --> 19:12.630
I'm the one who sent you down there.

19:15.210 --> 19:17.120
Listen.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.220
That gift I gave you,for
going down there...

19:22.570 --> 19:24.160
The stock.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.890
Do yourself a favor.

19:28.310 --> 19:30.690
Sell it tomorrow.

19:39.790 --> 19:42.520
Give me a double scotch.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.570
Do you believe this?

19:44.580 --> 19:47.670
I'm staying in a hotel room.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.970
I can't be in that house anymore.

19:51.300 --> 19:55.010
You better get me the best goddamn
divorce attorney in this city.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.840
Of course.

19:56.850 --> 19:59.160
One battle at a time.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.650
Thank you,that's enough.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.110
Art...

20:03.000 --> 20:05.010
we were right.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.530
About what?

20:07.850 --> 20:09.340
George moore.

20:10.790 --> 20:13.020
He sold you out.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.240
Arlington...

20:17.590 --> 20:19.870
gregory malina...

20:21.520 --> 20:25.320
it's all him.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.930
So you're meeting with moore again?

20:39.940 --> 20:41.100
Yeah.

20:41.110 --> 20:45.820
He won't give up frobisher,but
he's going to give us someone else.

20:45.830 --> 20:47.990
You've got him desperate.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.930
He's trying to make the case go
away before it closes in on him.

20:52.330 --> 20:56.040
If moore tipped off
frobisher,that's a crime.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.080
Why shouldn't we just
go after him for that?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.280
Because our clients come first.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.540
Criminal charges would take precedence.

21:02.550 --> 21:06.040
Our case could get pushed
another three years.

21:07.210 --> 21:09.650
We'll get there,ellen...

21:09.660 --> 21:12.000
once step at a time.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.850
here.

21:25.860 --> 21:27.270
What's this?

21:27.280 --> 21:29.940
It should hold you over for a few weeks.

21:29.950 --> 21:31.300
I'm not doing this for money.

21:31.310 --> 21:34.380
I know you're not,but take it.

21:34.650 --> 21:36.000
Don't be foolish,ellen.

21:36.010 --> 21:37.840
Everyone needs to eat.

21:37.850 --> 21:40.180
Mom? Yeah.

21:42.530 --> 21:43.610
Oh,hey.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.090
Sorry to interrupt.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.960
Michael,this is ellen parsons.

21:46.970 --> 21:47.940
Hi.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.150
Nice to meet you,michael.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.850
Yeah,cool.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.980
Are you using the car tonight?

21:52.990 --> 21:56.470
Me,henry and julius are
going to head to foxwoods.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.330
To the casino?

21:58.340 --> 22:00.520
You can't get in.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.010
Mom... fake ids?

22:04.020 --> 22:06.010
You guys have a nice night.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.130
She's kind of hot.

22:46.420 --> 22:49.730
Where the hell have you
been?I've been waiting for over...

23:34.190 --> 23:36.370
Are you sure you're all right?

23:36.760 --> 23:38.530
I'm fine.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.780
Here.

23:41.790 --> 23:44.290
I'm sorry you went through that.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.470
I hate these people.

23:53.560 --> 23:56.070
Photos link ray fiske to gregory malina,

23:56.080 --> 24:00.010
and the documents prove that
fiske's guilty of insider trading.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.760
you should be able to use that.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.750
It's blackmail,ellen.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.070
Just do what needs to be done.

24:13.580 --> 24:18.890
So mr.Frobisher offered $500 million to
settle,and patty hewes turned it down.

24:19.660 --> 24:21.710
at that price,this case should be over.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.410
She's overplaying her hand.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.890
Gone and convinced herself that

24:25.900 --> 24:31.050
arthur's outburst in that deposition room will
be worth more to a jury than it actually is.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.910
My grandfather adored you,ray.

24:36.220 --> 24:38.950
I'm told people thought
you were his son.

24:39.730 --> 24:43.390
He was a fine man,an even better mentor.

24:43.980 --> 24:47.540
He'd be tickled pink to see what
you've made of yourself,marshall.

24:47.970 --> 24:50.340
We all have the utmost
respect here for you,ray.

24:50.350 --> 24:51.950
We truly do.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.440
So I... I won't mince words.

24:56.390 --> 25:01.090
The senior partners have lost confidence in
your ability to effectively try this case.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.890
You've got to be kidding me.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.400
And as you know,

25:06.410 --> 25:11.270
mr.Frobisher's case bears enormous consequence
to the future well-being of this firm.

25:11.980 --> 25:14.930
The partners want me to
shadow you from here on out.

25:14.940 --> 25:19.400
You'll consult me on any and all
tactical decisions as we move to trial.

25:19.410 --> 25:24.550
Look,arthur frobisher is a stubborn man.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.960
Stubborn and complicated.

25:26.970 --> 25:32.400
There are complexities to the case
that are beyond the normal scope of...

25:32.410 --> 25:33.160
Look,ray...

25:33.170 --> 25:36.030
Marshall,I'm sorry,no offense,

25:36.040 --> 25:38.750
but I'm going to have to
talk this over with amos.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.220
It's been decided.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.530
I'll be looking over your shoulder
every step of the way,so...

25:44.820 --> 25:47.000
you'll turn over everything you've got,

25:47.010 --> 25:49.950
get me up to speed by
the end of the week.

25:57.470 --> 25:59.340
What do you have there,girl?

26:00.250 --> 26:01.520
Let me see.

26:01.530 --> 26:02.640
Come on.

26:02.650 --> 26:05.180
Come on,girl,open up.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.490
Don't you just love dogs?

26:08.980 --> 26:10.540
Yeah.

26:10.750 --> 26:12.680
They're like people.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.500
Only without the bullshit.

26:15.510 --> 26:17.430
Go play,girl,go.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.290
Client reps rethink the offer?

26:27.780 --> 26:29.760
What's this?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.570
It's our counter.

26:40.220 --> 26:44.780
The wealthy patron who paid gregory
malina's way down to florida,

26:44.790 --> 26:47.170
I'm guessing it was you,ray.

26:47.990 --> 26:49.920
Where'd you get these?

26:49.930 --> 26:51.880
Does it matter?

26:52.760 --> 26:56.190
They're just pictures,patty.

26:56.820 --> 27:00.270
They don't mean... anything.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.100
Read the document.

27:08.820 --> 27:12.440
You transferred stock to gregory malina,

27:12.450 --> 27:17.200
then told him to sell using
information you got from your client.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.970
I don't give a shit about
your private life,ray.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.660
- But I can't sit on this kind of information.
- Patty...

27:24.670 --> 27:28.610
Unless you and I come
to some arrangement.

27:29.130 --> 27:33.380
There is no way frobisher is going
to offer you a better settlement.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.540
I don't want one.

27:35.550 --> 27:39.040
This case is going to
be tried in a courtroom.

27:40.810 --> 27:44.440
I am not tanking my own case at trial.

27:44.450 --> 27:46.140
Think about it,ray.

27:46.150 --> 27:47.260
Take your time.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.200
I don't have to think about it.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.350
Frobisher's my client.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.370
And my friend.

27:52.380 --> 27:56.910
We wouldn't be having this conversation
if gregory malina were still alive.

27:57.230 --> 28:00.490
You're a baptist,right,ray?

28:01.390 --> 28:03.340
Repent.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.640
Thank you.

28:20.650 --> 28:23.610
Mr.Phillips wants to
sit down with you later.

28:24.260 --> 28:26.190
I'll be here.

29:28.900 --> 29:34.100
I think we just got
our second wedding gift.

29:34.110 --> 29:35.870
Really? Yeah.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.820
It's probably from aunt barbara.

29:37.830 --> 29:40.050
She told me she ordered
something online last week.

29:40.060 --> 29:42.840
Okay,hang on,mom.

29:42.850 --> 29:45.140
Hang on. I'll open it.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.240
- You know,
- Hang on.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.760
ordering gifts on the internet
is not as easy as people say.

29:50.770 --> 29:53.460
I tried to find your
name on the registry page,

29:53.470 --> 29:57.050
but there were six ellen
parsons in new york alone.

29:57.060 --> 30:01.040
Anyway,you know this means you're going
to have to start sending thank you notes.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.140
Oh,my god.

30:02.150 --> 30:03.840
What?

30:04.130 --> 30:05.760
Who would send this?

30:05.770 --> 30:07.810
What is it?

30:07.820 --> 30:11.720
Honey,what is it?

30:11.730 --> 30:13.480
I miss you David Love Lila

30:24.440 --> 30:25.750
Hey,ellen?

30:25.960 --> 30:27.230
What's going on?

30:27.240 --> 30:30.330
Yeah,do you still have
lila dimeo's phone number?

30:32.140 --> 30:34.280
yeah,I think.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.630
Hey,there,it's lila.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.820
Sorry,I'm not around,but i bet ya
know what to do and when to do it.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.760
This is ellen parsons.

30:48.770 --> 30:50.310
Stay away from my fianc?

30:50.320 --> 30:55.470
or i swear to god I will come
after you,you crazy bitch.

30:58.810 --> 31:00.890
2 DAYS LATER

31:02.340 --> 31:04.510
We're done,ellen.

31:32.570 --> 31:33.830
hello?

31:34.540 --> 31:35.600
Li... stop,stop it.

31:35.610 --> 31:37.440
Just stop. Listen to me.

31:37.450 --> 31:39.030
Damn it,will
you just-- no!

31:39.040 --> 31:42.930
Lila,you need to stop calling me!

33:04.340 --> 33:05.450
That was,uh...

33:05.460 --> 33:06.410
that was great,ray.

33:06.860 --> 33:07.990
Thanks for dinner.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.510
- Had to celebrate your new job.
- Yeah.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.290
JULY 2002

33:12.720 --> 33:15.280
It's gonna feel strange
going to work in a suit.

33:15.290 --> 33:16.850
Looks good on you.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.340
Thanks.

33:18.910 --> 33:20.750
Gregory...

33:21.500 --> 33:22.870
What is it?

33:23.950 --> 33:27.330
We can't be in contact anymore.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.100
Why not?

33:30.740 --> 33:33.670
Looks like the government
is charging my client.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.520
I... I don't know anything.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.930
You know enough.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.120
We can't be seen together.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.300
Okay.

33:49.410 --> 33:52.050
I'm gonna miss you,gregory.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.090
I'll miss you too,ray.

33:57.950 --> 33:59.420
Gregory...

34:00.410 --> 34:01.860
What?

34:03.540 --> 34:05.620
What is it?

34:09.840 --> 34:12.139
- No,ray...
- Gregory,please.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.420
Please...

34:14.290 --> 34:16.370
No,ray,come on. That'S...

34:17.040 --> 34:18.270
that's not who I am.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.469
I don't believe you.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.409
Ray.

34:21.790 --> 34:22.790
Please.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.909
Jesus,ray!

34:29.600 --> 34:30.870
I'm sorry.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.070
I'm sorry,ray.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.580
I'm sorry. I...

35:13.510 --> 35:15.710
What is it,ray?

35:16.370 --> 35:18.800
George moore is dead.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.360
I heard.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.850
I got a letter...

35:27.860 --> 35:30.880
- from gregory malina.
- When?

35:33.930 --> 35:35.970
It's over,art.

35:36.780 --> 35:38.670
What is?

35:40.930 --> 35:41.970
It's over.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.040
Ray,what's over?

35:44.050 --> 35:46.480
Ray,what the hell are you talking ab...

36:13.500 --> 36:14.620
Hey.

36:15.510 --> 36:17.140
Mallory.

36:19.730 --> 36:21.600
what time is it?

36:21.950 --> 36:23.430
Did you eat?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.830
There's some grilled
salmon in the fridge.

36:28.090 --> 36:30.230
First thing in the morning...

36:31.450 --> 36:33.140
we have to leave.

36:34.910 --> 36:38.310
- To go where,my sister's?
- No...

36:40.940 --> 36:43.240
we have to get out of the country.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.400
I don't understand.

36:46.610 --> 36:47.950
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

36:47.960 --> 36:52.330
Right now I need you to pack our things.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.340
Ray,you have to tell me what...

36:54.350 --> 36:55.940
Mal...

36:56.340 --> 36:58.740
you have to trust me.

36:59.820 --> 37:01.450
Will you do that?

37:01.460 --> 37:02.950
Yes...

37:03.810 --> 37:06.110
yes,of course.

37:06.810 --> 37:08.540
Okay.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.050
I have a few things I
have to take care of.

37:29.230 --> 37:30.780
You got my message?

37:30.790 --> 37:32.440
I did.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.690
Yeah,so...

37:34.700 --> 37:37.210
I've been mulling things over.

37:37.480 --> 37:41.370
I'd like to sit down with
you,see how we can work this out.

37:41.380 --> 37:43.610
I'm glad to hear it,ray.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.030
We can get together first
thing in the morning.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.130
I'd prefer sooner.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.710
I don't want this hanging
over me,you understand?

37:50.720 --> 37:52.020
Of course.

37:52.030 --> 37:54.240
What are you doing later tonight?

37:54.250 --> 37:57.060
I can be anywhere you want me to be.

38:08.970 --> 38:12.590
Yeah,it was the first movie I saw in,like,
four months where I actually stayed awake.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.010
- OK
-Yeah

38:15.020 --> 38:16.870
*****

38:16.880 --> 38:19.240
Okay,babe.I love you

38:19.250 --> 38:20.610
Love

39:14.730 --> 39:16.320
Hey there,ray.

39:17.450 --> 39:19.460
Hello,patty.

39:22.670 --> 39:24.220
You want a drink?

39:24.550 --> 39:26.040
Thanks,no.

39:26.050 --> 39:27.700
Well,sit.

39:33.470 --> 39:35.420
how you holding up?

39:37.490 --> 39:39.510
I've been better.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.480
Did I ever tell you why
I became a lawyer,ray?

39:59.160 --> 40:02.350
No,you never told me.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.990
I thought I could change the world.

40:06.750 --> 40:08.500
Silly,huh?

40:09.540 --> 40:12.630
I just liked getting
to wear a tie every day.

40:16.730 --> 40:20.560
You and I are two
sides of the same coin.

40:20.780 --> 40:22.510
How's that?

40:22.930 --> 40:24.960
We love the game.

40:24.970 --> 40:26.630
Another case,a bigger win.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.440
It's an addiction like any other.

40:31.430 --> 40:34.170
You're blackmailing me,patty.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.510
Yes.

40:36.740 --> 40:38.590
I'm sorry.

40:39.530 --> 40:41.510
Long as we're clear.

40:41.520 --> 40:44.410
Frobisher is guilty,ray.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.160
Help me set things right.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.010
You're a friend.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.310
We bring out the best in each other.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.870
After this,we have a
hundred more rounds to go.

40:53.490 --> 40:56.310
I don't see how that's possible.

40:56.790 --> 41:00.030
I am not looking to destroy you.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.670
We attorneys survive.

41:02.910 --> 41:05.630
It's the clients that come and go.

41:07.310 --> 41:10.010
I can't go into a courtroom...

41:10.350 --> 41:13.160
and deliberately lose my case.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.890
I know it will be painful,ray.

41:15.900 --> 41:20.240
But six months,a year from
now,it'll all blow over,

41:20.250 --> 41:23.030
and you'll come work with me.

41:26.410 --> 41:27.500
Patty...

41:27.510 --> 41:29.660
I'm serious.

41:32.050 --> 41:33.520
You would do that?

41:33.530 --> 41:37.230
Hire the finest goddamn litigator
I've ever come up against?

41:37.240 --> 41:38.580
Yes,ray.

41:38.590 --> 41:40.590
Absolutely.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.620
There's a place for you here.

41:46.790 --> 41:50.510
It's win-win,for both of us.

42:10.760 --> 42:11.770
Okay,patty.

42:12.100 --> 42:13.620
Good,ray.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.030
I'm glad.

43:15.670 --> 43:17.600
You know...

43:24.770 --> 43:28.490
I always wanted to work with you,patty.

43:32.030 --> 43:34.670
Not anymore.
