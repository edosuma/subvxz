<i>Singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain</i>

00:25.943 --> 00:30.239
<i>What a glorious feelin'
We're happy again</i>

00:30.280 --> 00:32.323
<i>We'll walk down the lane</i>

00:32.323 --> 00:34.322
<i>With a happy refrain</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:37.912
<i>And singin'
Just singin' in the rain</i>

01:38.890 --> 01:41.684
<i>This is Dora Bailey,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:41.685 --> 01:45.731
<i>talking to you from the front of
the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:49.272
<i>What a night, ladies and
gentlemen. What a night!</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:53.905
Every star in Hollywood is here to
make Monumental Pictures' premiere...

01:53.947 --> 01:58.993
of <i>The Royal Rascal</i>,
the outstanding event of 1927.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.071
Everyone is
breathlessly awaiting...

02:01.121 --> 02:04.721
the arrival of Lina Lamont
and Don Lockwood.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.119
Look who's arriving now.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.963
It's that famous "zip"
girl of the screen...

02:10.005 --> 02:12.207
the darling of the flapper set...

02:12.257 --> 02:14.425
Zelda Zanders!

02:15.594 --> 02:18.263
Zelda! Zelda!

02:18.555 --> 02:22.760
Her new red-hot pash,
J. Cumberland Spendrill III...

02:22.809 --> 02:26.013
that well-known eligible bachelor.

02:26.063 --> 02:31.394
Zelda's had so much unhappiness,
I hope this time it's really love.

02:32.069 --> 02:36.489
And here comes that
exotic star, Olga Mara!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.699
Ooh.

02:38.700 --> 02:43.622
And her new husband,
the Baron de la Bonnet de la Toulon.

02:43.789 --> 02:48.460
They've been married two months already,
but still as happy as newlyweds.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.624
Well, well, well. It's Cosmo Brown!

03:00.347 --> 03:02.265
Cosmo is Don's best friend.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.805
He plays the piano on the
set for Don and Lina...

03:04.851 --> 03:08.521
to get them into those
romantic moods!

03:08.730 --> 03:10.932
Oh, folks, this is it. This is it!

03:17.989 --> 03:22.319
The stars of tonight's picture,
those romantic lovers of the screen...

03:22.369 --> 03:25.163
Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont!

03:30.961 --> 03:34.586
Ladies and gentlemen, when you
look at this gorgeous couple...

03:34.631 --> 03:38.335
it's no wonder they're a household
name all over the world.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.671
Like "bacon and eggs."

03:41.346 --> 03:44.174
"Lockwood and Lamont."

03:46.476 --> 03:49.894
Don, tell me confidentially,
are these rumors true...

03:49.895 --> 03:52.724
that wedding bells are soon
to ring for you and Lina?

03:52.774 --> 03:56.067
Lina and I have no statement
to make at the present time.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.521
We're just good friends.

03:57.529 --> 04:01.734
You've come a long way together.
Won't you tell us how it happened?

04:01.783 --> 04:05.201
Lina and I have made a number
of pictures together...

04:05.202 --> 04:08.828
Oh, no, no, Don. I want your
story from the beginning.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.998
Dora, not in front
of all these people!

04:15.380 --> 04:18.208
The story of your success
is an inspiration...

04:18.257 --> 04:20.711
to young people all over the world.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.344
Please!

04:25.766 --> 04:28.515
Well, to begin with,
any story of my career...

04:28.560 --> 04:32.560
would have to include my
lifelong friend, Cosmo Brown.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.566
We were kids together, grew
up together, worked together.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.768
Yes?

04:37.402 --> 04:42.529
Well, Dora, I've had one motto
which I've always lived by:

04:42.949 --> 04:46.073
"Dignity. Always dignity."

04:46.536 --> 04:50.912
This was instilled in me by Mum
and Dad from the very beginning.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.411
They sent me to the finest
schools, including dancing school.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.747
That's where I first met Cosmo.

04:56.797 --> 05:01.252
And with him, I used to perform for
Mum and Dad's society friends.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.599
<i>They used to make
such a fuss over me.</i>

05:11.645 --> 05:16.601
<i>If I was very good, I was allowed to
accompany Mum and Dad to the theater.</i>

05:16.650 --> 05:18.852
<i>They brought me up on Shaw...</i>

05:18.902 --> 05:21.901
<i>Molière, the finest
of the classics.</i>

05:23.240 --> 05:26.284
To this was added rigorous
musical training...

05:26.285 --> 05:28.657
at the Conservatory of Fine Arts.

05:33.750 --> 05:38.330
<i>We rounded out our apprenticeship
at an exclusive dramatics academy.</i>

05:39.381 --> 05:41.379
<i>And at all times...</i>

05:41.424 --> 05:43.297
<i>the motto remained...</i>

05:43.593 --> 05:44.840
<i>"...Dignity."</i>

05:44.886 --> 05:47.009
<i>"Always dignity."</i>

05:48.974 --> 05:53.054
<i>In a few years, we were ready to
embark on a dance concert tour.</i>

05:53.770 --> 05:57.395
<i>We played the finest symphonic
halls in the country.</i>

05:58.191 --> 06:00.151
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:02.736
<i>I can jump over
The moon up above</i>

06:02.737 --> 06:05.531
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

06:06.908 --> 06:08.906
<i>Haven't a worry
Haven't a care</i>

06:08.952 --> 06:11.371
<i>Feelin' like a feather
That's floatin' on air</i>

06:11.372 --> 06:14.324
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

06:15.166 --> 06:19.667
<i>Soon the church bells will be ringin'
And a march with Ma and Pa</i>

06:19.713 --> 06:21.881
<i>How the church bells
will be ringin'</i>

06:21.923 --> 06:24.626
<i>With a hey-nonny-nonny
And a hot-cha-cha</i>

06:24.634 --> 06:26.677
<i>Hi diddle diddle
My baby's okay</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:29.218
<i>Ask me a riddle
I'm happy to say</i>

06:29.222 --> 06:32.175
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

07:30.325 --> 07:32.868
<i>Audiences everywhere adored us.</i>

07:32.869 --> 07:34.070
Get out of here!

07:35.288 --> 07:38.617
<i>Finally we decided to
come to sunny California.</i>

07:39.209 --> 07:42.162
<i>We were stranded... We were
staying here, resting up...</i>

07:42.212 --> 07:45.507
<i>when offers from the movie
studios started pouring in.</i>

07:45.548 --> 07:50.128
<i>We sorted them out and decided
to favor Monumental Pictures.</i>

07:50.345 --> 07:54.013
Lina, you hate him. Resist him.
Keep that mood music going.

07:54.014 --> 07:56.513
Now, Phil, you come in.
Keep on grinding.

07:56.559 --> 08:01.310
Now you see her. Now here's the bit,
Bert, where you get it on the jaw.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.183
Cut!

08:03.233 --> 08:05.310
No, no! That wasn't right!

08:05.360 --> 08:09.861
You were supposed to go over the bar and
crash into the glasses! Try it again!

08:09.864 --> 08:11.941
Okay, Bert? Bert!

08:11.992 --> 08:14.240
Oh, that's swell, just swell.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.412
Take him away, fellas!

08:16.413 --> 08:20.334
You'll be all right. We've lost
more stuntmen on these pictures...

08:20.375 --> 08:23.419
It'll take hours to get a new
one from Central Casting.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.622
Mr. Dexter, I can do that.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.625
- You? You're a musician.
- That's a moot point.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.631
No kidding! What's your name?

08:30.677 --> 08:33.471
Don Lockwood, but the
fellas call me "Donald."

08:33.513 --> 08:36.386
Wise guy, huh? Okay. I'll try you.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.475
Get this guy into Bert's suit!

08:38.476 --> 08:43.273
And remember, Lockwood, you might
be trading that fiddle in for a harp.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.567
Camera!

08:47.402 --> 08:50.321
Phil, come in. Now you
see him. That's it.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.032
Now, here's where you
get it right on the jaw.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.027
Cut!

08:56.036 --> 08:57.704
That was wonderful!

08:59.289 --> 09:01.617
Got any more little
chores you want done?

09:01.666 --> 09:02.992
Plenty!

09:07.172 --> 09:08.624
Okay.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.529
<i>My roles in these
films were urbane...</i>

09:32.530 --> 09:34.073
<i>sophisticated...</i>

09:34.074 --> 09:35.275
<i>suave.</i>

09:38.036 --> 09:41.035
And of course, all through
those pictures...

09:41.039 --> 09:44.708
Lina was, as always,
an inspiration to me.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.661
Warm and helpful.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.663
A real lady.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.050
Hello, Miss Lamont. I'm Don
Lockwood, the stuntman.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.800
It was a thrill working
with you, Miss Lamont.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.267
Hey, Don.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.388
Meet the producer of the
picture, R.F. Simpson.

10:05.396 --> 10:09.396
I just saw some rushes and asked
Dexter who the stuntmen were.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.863
He said they were all you. I'm putting
you and Lina together in a picture.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.483
Come to my office.
We'll discuss a contract.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.485
Thanks, Mr. Simpson!

10:22.247 --> 10:25.417
Are you doing anything
tonight, Miss Lamont?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.544
That's funny.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.088
I'm busy.

10:35.051 --> 10:39.427
<i>Lina and I have had the same
wonderful relationship ever since.</i>

10:39.556 --> 10:43.602
But most important of all,
I continue living up to my motto:

10:43.935 --> 10:45.261
"Dignity.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.680
Always dignity."

10:49.065 --> 10:50.266
Thank you, Don.

10:50.316 --> 10:55.022
And I'm sure you and Lina will continue
making movie history tonight...

10:55.071 --> 11:00.027
in your greatest picture,
<i>The Royal Rascal.</i>

11:03.621 --> 11:05.164
Get enough, boys?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.286
She's so refined...

11:44.329 --> 11:46.873
I think I'll kill myself.

12:25.787 --> 12:30.208
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.375
We're thrilled at your
response to <i>The Royal Rascal.</i>

12:35.421 --> 12:39.922
We had fun making it, and we hope
you had fun seeing it tonight.

12:42.637 --> 12:47.138
We screen actors aren't much
good at speaking in public.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.727
So we'll just act out our thanks.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.324
- Hot diggity! It's a smash!
- Don, Lina, you were gorgeous!

13:03.366 --> 13:04.709
Lina, you looked pretty
good for a girl.

13:04.810 --> 13:07.362
For heaven's sake!
What's the big idea?

13:07.412 --> 13:11.537
Can't a girl get a word in edgewise?
They're my public too!

13:11.582 --> 13:13.284
The publicity department...

13:13.293 --> 13:17.129
thought it'd be better if Don made
all the speeches for the team.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.331
Why?

13:18.339 --> 13:21.668
You're beautiful. Audiences
think you got a voice to match.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.755
We gotta keep our stars from
looking ridiculous at any cost.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.445
- No one's got that much money.
- What's wrong with the way I talk?

13:28.309 --> 13:31.877
What's the big idea?
Am I dumb or something?

13:32.478 --> 13:35.648
No, it's just that Don's had
so much more experience...

13:35.690 --> 13:39.360
Next time, write me out
a speech. I could memorize it.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.776
Sure. Why don't you recite
the Gettysburg Address?

13:42.780 --> 13:47.531
What do you know about it,
you piano player? Are you anybody?

13:47.577 --> 13:51.998
Donnie, how can you let him talk
to me like that, your fiancée?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.578
My fia...

13:53.833 --> 13:57.412
Lina, you've been reading
those fan magazines again.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.836
Look, you shouldn't believe
all that banana oil...

14:00.840 --> 14:03.213
that Dora Bailey dishes out.

14:03.217 --> 14:07.422
Now, try to get this straight:
There is nothing between us.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.221
There has never been
anything between us.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.678
- Just air.
- Oh, Donnie, you don't mean that.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.851
We'll be late for R.F.'s party.

14:15.897 --> 14:19.727
Better go in separate cars to break
up the mobs. Come on, honey.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.687
Ta-ta, Donnie! See you there!

14:23.780 --> 14:24.981
"Donnie."

14:25.281 --> 14:27.824
Can't that girl take a gentle hint?

14:27.825 --> 14:31.325
Haven't you heard? She's
irresistible. She told me so.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.871
I can't get her out of my hair.
This romance for publicity...

14:34.916 --> 14:37.585
The price of fame.
You've got the glory.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.628
The little heartaches go with it.

14:39.629 --> 14:43.629
Look at me. I got no glory.
I got no fame. I got no mansions.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.377
I got no money. But I've got...

14:46.636 --> 14:49.055
- What have I got?
- I don't know.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.885
I gotta get out of here.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.859
Don't tell me. It's a flat tire.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.275
This car hasn't given me
trouble in nearly six hours.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.152
Hey, there's Don Lockwood!

15:07.740 --> 15:09.283
Hey, give me an autograph!

15:09.325 --> 15:12.904
- Give me your autograph!
- I want a souvenir!

15:12.954 --> 15:14.781
I want a souvenir too!

15:14.831 --> 15:18.376
Hey! You're playing rough here!
You're tearing my...!

15:18.709 --> 15:21.458
Hey, Cos, do something!
Call me a cab!

15:21.462 --> 15:22.788
You're a cab.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.878
Thanks a lot!

15:39.188 --> 15:40.890
- Lady, keep driving.
- Get out!

15:40.898 --> 15:43.817
- Everything's all right!
- I'll call a policeman!

15:43.818 --> 15:45.734
- Just a few blocks.
- Don't hurt me!

15:45.735 --> 15:48.155
- I'm not a criminal.
- I don't care...

15:48.197 --> 15:51.992
You are a criminal! I've seen
that face. You're a gangster!

15:51.993 --> 15:55.579
I've seen your picture in the
paper or in the post office.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.827
Officer!

15:56.831 --> 16:00.956
- This man jumped in my car and...
- Why, it's Don Lockwood!

16:01.002 --> 16:03.921
- Don Lockwood?
- How are you? Out for a joy ride?

16:03.963 --> 16:07.463
Just a lift. My car broke down.
I got surrounded by...

16:07.508 --> 16:10.336
- You're a lucky lady. Anything wrong?
- Why, no.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.467
No, I should think not. Good night.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.340
Good night, officer.

16:15.558 --> 16:19.763
Well, thanks for saving
my life. I'll get out now.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.938
I'm driving to Beverly Hills.
Can I drop you someplace?

16:22.939 --> 16:27.646
I'd like to get out of this suit if
you're going by Camden and Sunset.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.275
Yes, I am.

16:33.034 --> 16:36.329
I'd like to know whose
hospitality I'm enjoying.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.322
Selden. Kathy Selden.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.540
Enchanted, Miss Selden.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.667
I'm sorry I frightened you.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.122
I was getting a little too
much love from my fans.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.046
Oh, that's what you
were running away from.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.261
They did that to you?
That's terrible!

16:55.264 --> 16:57.592
Yes. Yes, it is, isn't it?

16:57.642 --> 16:59.344
It is terrible.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.805
Well, we movie stars
get the glory...

17:02.813 --> 17:06.643
I guess we have to take the little
heartaches that go with it.

17:06.943 --> 17:11.068
People think we lead lives
of glamour and romance...

17:11.113 --> 17:13.156
but we're really lonely.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.696
Terribly lonely.

17:15.701 --> 17:20.496
I really can't tell you how sorry
I am about taking you for a criminal.

17:20.497 --> 17:24.794
But it was understandable, under the
circumstances. I knew I'd seen you.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.462
Which of my pictures have you seen?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.755
I don't remember.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.750
I saw one once.

17:31.342 --> 17:34.295
- You saw one once?
- I think you were dueling.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.513
And there was a girl. Lina Lamont.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.554
I don't go to the movies much.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.853
If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.013
Thank you.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.435
No offense.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.775
Movies are entertaining
for the masses...

17:47.817 --> 17:51.066
but the personalities on the
screen don't impress me.

17:51.112 --> 17:54.942
They don't talk or act.
They just make a lot of dumb show.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.613
Well, you know.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.361
Like that.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.072
You mean, like what I do.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.166
Well, yes.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.328
Here we are, Sunset and Camden.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.586
Wait, you mean I'm not an actor?

18:11.591 --> 18:14.260
- Pantomime isn't acting?
- Of course not.

18:14.343 --> 18:18.013
Acting means great parts,
wonderful lines, glorious words.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.431
Shakespeare. Ibsen.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.550
What's your lofty
mission in life...

18:21.601 --> 18:25.101
that lets you sneer at
my humble profession?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.056
I'm an actress. On the stage.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.811
Oh, on the stage.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.436
I'd like to see you.
What're you in now?

18:31.485 --> 18:34.905
I could brush up on my English
or bring an interpreter.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.987
That's if they'd let
in a movie actor.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.075
I'm not in a play now.
But I'm going to New York...

18:40.076 --> 18:44.657
You're going to New York, and someday
we'll all hear of you, won't we?

18:44.665 --> 18:48.244
Kathy Selden as Juliet,
as Lady Macbeth, as King Lear!

18:48.294 --> 18:49.871
You'll have to wear a beard!

18:49.920 --> 18:53.590
Laugh if you want, but the stage
is a dignified profession.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.714
Why are you so conceited?

18:55.760 --> 19:00.010
You're nothing but a shadow on film.
You're not flesh and blood.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.637
- Stop!
- What can I do? I'm only a shadow.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.767
Keep away from me! Just because
you're a big movie star...

19:06.812 --> 19:10.731
you expect every girl to faint
at your feet. Don't touch me!

19:10.732 --> 19:13.436
Fear not, sweet lady.
I will not molest you.

19:13.486 --> 19:18.658
I am but a humble jester. And you?
You are too far above me.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.947
Farewell, Ethel Barrymore.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.288
I must tear myself from your side.

19:36.133 --> 19:40.258
Is this R.F. Simpson's house?
I'm one of the Coconut Grove girls.

19:40.304 --> 19:44.725
- Yes, the floor show. Around the back.
- Oh, I see. Thank you.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.285
- Nice little party, R.F.
- Thanks, Roscoe.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.538
Do you really think you
can get me in the movies?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.789
- I should think so.
- Really?

20:15.840 --> 20:19.670
- The picture's great.
- There's Don. I loved the picture.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.339
- Did you come by way of Australia?
- Hello, Cos. Excuse me.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.468
Cos, tell me the truth.
Am I a good actor?

20:26.517 --> 20:29.345
As long as I work for Monumental,
you're the greatest.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.931
No kidding. You're my pal.
You can tell me.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.354
What's the matter?
Of course, you're good.

20:34.358 --> 20:38.313
Keep telling me from time
to time. I feel a little shaken.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.064
- The new Don Lockwood.
- Don!

20:40.489 --> 20:43.863
- Hi, R.F.
- It's colossal. Where have you been?

20:43.909 --> 20:46.745
There you are. Where were you?
I was lonely.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.947
Hello, Lina.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.699
Okay, fellas. Hold it.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.626
Together again, my two
little stars, Don and Lina.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.046
No kidding, folks,
aren't they great?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.463
All right, open that screen.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.803
- A movie? We just saw one.
- Gotta show one at a party. It's a law.

21:04.804 --> 21:07.724
Everybody, I've got a
few surprises for you.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.098
All right, sit down, sit down.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.933
This'll make you laugh.

21:12.021 --> 21:15.521
There's a madman coming into
my office for months, and...

21:15.649 --> 21:18.568
- You got that gadget working?
- All set.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.646
Okay, let her go.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.036
<i>Hello.</i>

21:28.454 --> 21:33.000
<i>This is a demonstration
of a talking picture.</i>

21:33.209 --> 21:38.254
<i>Notice, it is a picture
of me and I am talking.</i>

21:38.255 --> 21:42.631
<i>Note how my lips and the
sound issuing from them...</i>

21:42.635 --> 21:45.304
<i>are synchronized together...</i>

21:45.346 --> 21:48.299
<i>in perfect unison.</i>

21:48.891 --> 21:52.059
- Who's that?
- Somebody's talking behind that screen.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.639
Come out from behind
that screen, Mr. Simpson.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.523
Oh, no. I'm right here.

21:59.318 --> 22:03.068
<i>My voice has been
recorded on a record.</i>

22:03.155 --> 22:05.357
<i>A talking picture.</i>

22:05.783 --> 22:07.405
<i>Thank you.</i>

22:07.451 --> 22:08.777
<i>Goodbye.</i>

22:12.206 --> 22:13.407
Well?

22:13.749 --> 22:16.498
- It's just a toy.
- It's a scream!

22:16.585 --> 22:19.709
- It's vulgar.
- You think they'll ever use it?

22:19.755 --> 22:23.924
I doubt it. Warners is making a
picture with it, <i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

22:23.925 --> 22:27.426
- They'll lose their shirts.
- It'll never amount to a thing.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.427
They said that about the
horseless carriage.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.804
Let's get on with the show.
Okay, boys.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.053
Come on, my little starlets.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.812
I have a surprise.
A very special cake.

22:36.813 --> 22:39.688
I want you kiddies to
have the first piece.

22:44.989 --> 22:48.159
Well! If it isn't Ethel Barrymore!

22:53.789 --> 22:59.120
I do hope you'll favor us with something
special. Say, Hamlet's soliloquy...

22:59.128 --> 23:02.457
or a scene from Romeo
and Juliet? Don't be shy.

23:02.506 --> 23:06.586
You make about the prettiest
Juliet I've ever seen. Really.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.347
<i>All I do is dream of you
The whole night through</i>

23:13.767 --> 23:17.562
<i>With the dawn I still go on
Dreaming of you</i>

23:17.646 --> 23:19.974
<i>You're every thought
You're everything</i>

23:20.024 --> 23:21.646
<i>You're every song I ever sing</i>

23:21.692 --> 23:25.567
<i>Summer, winter, autumn and spring</i>

23:25.571 --> 23:29.571
<i>And were there more than
Twenty-four hours a day</i>

23:29.825 --> 23:33.495
<i>They'd be spent in sweet content
Dreaming away</i>

23:33.704 --> 23:35.872
<i>When skies are gray
When skies are blue</i>

23:35.873 --> 23:37.871
<i>Morning, noon and nighttime too</i>

23:37.875 --> 23:42.080
<i>All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you</i>

24:04.109 --> 24:05.902
<i>It's the cat's meow!</i>

24:09.239 --> 24:13.285
<i>All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you</i>

24:13.369 --> 24:16.038
- I had to tell you how good you were.
- Excuse me.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.705
Now that I know where you live,
I'd like to see you home.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.420
- Listen, Mr. Lockwood...
- Say, who is this dame anyway?

24:23.421 --> 24:26.464
Someone lofty and far above us all.

24:26.465 --> 24:31.045
She couldn't learn anything from
the movies. She's a stage actress.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.424
Here's one thing I've
learned from the movies!

24:38.435 --> 24:41.479
- I'll kill her!
- Lina, she was aiming at me!

24:41.522 --> 24:44.225
- You never looked lovelier.
- It was an accident.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.522
It happens to me five
or six times a day.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.020
Where is she?

24:48.654 --> 24:49.946
Donnie?

24:52.741 --> 24:55.035
Excuse me. Where'd Miss Selden go?

24:55.077 --> 24:58.827
She grabbed her things and
bolted. Anything I can do?

24:58.872 --> 25:01.700
Sorry. I don't have
time to find out.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.954
Kathy!

25:05.963 --> 25:07.460
Hey, Kathy!

25:09.425 --> 25:10.797
Hey!

25:36.827 --> 25:39.871
Keep that action going.
More steam in the kettle!

25:39.913 --> 25:42.286
More action, boys.
A little more rhythm.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.250
More steam and more water.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.248
- Hi, Maxie.
- Hi, Don.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.164
- Good morning, fellas.
- Hiya, Don.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.132
Did you read Variety today?

25:51.133 --> 25:55.088
"First talking picture, The Jazz Singer.
All-time smash end of first week."

25:55.095 --> 25:58.265
- All-time flop end of the second.
- We start today.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.599
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.436
I'm now Count Pierre de Bataille,
known as the Duelling Cavalier.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.273
- What's it about?
- It's a French Revolution story.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.233
You're a French aristocrat.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.896
She's a simple girl of the people
and won't even give you a tumble.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.947
Well, it's a living.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.032
Good morning.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.785
Keep the background moving.
Hit him.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.368
Come on. Knock him down!

26:20.369 --> 26:23.119
Get up there and hit
him again. Hurry up!

26:23.165 --> 26:26.665
Why bother to shoot this? Release
the old one under a new title.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.212
You've seen one,
you've seen them all.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.541
- Why'd you say that?
- What's the matter?

26:31.548 --> 26:34.547
That's what that Kathy Selden
said to me that night.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.925
That's three weeks ago.
You still thinking about that?

26:38.097 --> 26:41.801
- I can't get her out of my mind.
- How could you?

26:41.850 --> 26:45.270
She's the first dame who hasn't
fallen for you since you were 4.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.897
She's on my conscience.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.980
It's not your fault
she lost her job.

26:48.981 --> 26:51.480
- I've got to find her.
- You've been trying to.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.983
Short of sending out
bloodhounds and a posse.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.776
Come on, now. Snap out of it.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.782
You can't let this get you down.

26:57.866 --> 27:01.409
You're Donald Lockwood. Donald
Lockwood's an actor, isn't he?

27:01.410 --> 27:03.488
What's the first thing
an actor learns?

27:03.497 --> 27:08.828
"The show must go on, come rain,
come shine, come snow, come sleet!"

27:12.756 --> 27:14.003
Yeah.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.335
<i>The world's so full
Of a number of things</i>

27:16.385 --> 27:18.929
<i>I'm sure we should all
Be as happy as...</i>

27:18.971 --> 27:20.673
<i>But are we? No</i>

27:20.722 --> 27:21.923
<i>Definitely, no</i>

27:21.932 --> 27:24.635
<i>Positively, no
Decidedly, no</i>

27:27.229 --> 27:29.477
<i>Short people have long faces</i>

27:29.523 --> 27:31.521
<i>Long people have short faces</i>

27:31.525 --> 27:34.695
<i>Big people have little humor
Little people have no humor at all</i>

27:35.863 --> 27:39.237
<i>In the words of that immortal bard
Samuel J. Snodgrass</i>

27:39.241 --> 27:41.819
<i>As he was being led
To the guillotine</i>

27:42.619 --> 27:45.698
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

27:45.706 --> 27:48.625
<i>Don't you know everyone
wants to laugh, ha, ha</i>

27:49.084 --> 27:52.037
<i>My dad said, "Be an actor, my son".</i>

27:52.462 --> 27:54.710
<i>"But be a comical one"</i>

27:54.756 --> 27:57.709
<i>They'll be standin' in lines</i>

27:57.801 --> 28:01.130
<i>For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines</i>

28:01.221 --> 28:04.265
<i>Now you could study Shakespeare
And be quite elite</i>

28:04.308 --> 28:07.182
<i>And you could charm the critics
And have nothing to eat</i>

28:07.186 --> 28:10.139
<i>Just slip on a banana peel
The world's at your feet</i>

28:10.189 --> 28:11.856
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

28:11.857 --> 28:13.024
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

28:13.025 --> 28:14.226
Make...?

28:14.651 --> 28:16.148
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

28:16.153 --> 28:19.653
<i>Don't you know everyone
wants to laugh?</i>

28:19.656 --> 28:22.780
<i>My Grandpa said,
"Go out and tell 'em a joke"</i>

28:23.243 --> 28:25.741
<i>"but give it plenty of hoke"</i>

28:25.787 --> 28:28.490
<i>Make 'em roar
Make 'em scream</i>

28:28.540 --> 28:31.835
<i>Take a fall, butt a wall
Split a seam</i>

28:31.877 --> 28:34.921
<i>You start off by pretending
You're a dancer with grace</i>

28:34.963 --> 28:37.962
<i>You wiggle till they're giggling
All over the place</i>

28:38.008 --> 28:40.802
<i>And then you get
A great big custard pie in the face</i>

28:40.844 --> 28:42.421
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

28:42.471 --> 28:44.093
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

28:45.390 --> 28:47.012
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

28:47.017 --> 28:48.476
<i>Don't ya...
All the...</i>

28:48.477 --> 28:49.769
<i>What...?</i>

28:50.395 --> 28:51.687
<i>My Dad...</i>

28:56.068 --> 28:59.238
<i>They'll be standing in lines</i>

28:59.279 --> 29:02.733
<i>For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines</i>

30:15.314 --> 30:18.609
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

30:18.650 --> 30:21.273
<i>Don't you know everyone...</i>

30:30.871 --> 30:32.197
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

30:35.125 --> 30:36.451
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

30:39.171 --> 30:40.793
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

30:44.301 --> 30:47.596
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

30:47.637 --> 30:50.636
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

30:56.813 --> 30:58.014
Ready, Don?

30:58.106 --> 31:00.104
- All set.
- Here we go again.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.811
- We have another smash on our hands.
- I hope so.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.313
You're darn tooting we have.

31:04.321 --> 31:07.149
- Where's Lina?
- Here she is, Mr. Dexter.

31:07.199 --> 31:10.284
Well! Here comes our
lovely leading lady now.

31:10.285 --> 31:13.830
This wig weighs a ton. What
dope'd wear a thing like this?

31:13.831 --> 31:15.289
Everybody wore them.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.163
Then everybody was a dope.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.244
- You look beautiful.
- You look great.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.329
Let's get into the set.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.039
Thanks, Joe.

31:23.048 --> 31:27.128
I looked for you at Wally Ray's
party. Where were you?

31:27.135 --> 31:28.882
I've been busy.

31:28.929 --> 31:32.178
And I know what you've been
busy at. Looking for that girl.

31:32.182 --> 31:34.601
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Why?

31:34.643 --> 31:36.095
I've been worried about her.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.267
You should've been
worried about me.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.392
I'm the one who got the
whipped cream in the kisser.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.064
Yes, but you didn't lose
your job, and she did.

31:44.069 --> 31:47.238
Darn tooting she did.
I arranged it.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.440
What?

31:48.448 --> 31:52.027
They weren't gonna fire her,
so I told them they better.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.950
- Why...
- Don, now remember.

31:53.954 --> 31:57.909
You're madly in love with her and
you have to overcome her shyness.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.952
Cosmo, mood music.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.081
Roll 'em!

32:05.424 --> 32:07.046
Okay, Don.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.464
Now enter.

32:09.511 --> 32:10.803
You see her.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.639
Run to her!

32:17.227 --> 32:21.182
Why, you rattlesnake, you.
You got that poor kid fired.

32:21.189 --> 32:25.394
That's not all I'm gonna do if
I ever get my hands on her.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.022
I never heard of anything so low.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.697
Fine. Fine. Looks great.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.070
What did you do it for?

32:32.117 --> 32:35.411
Because you liked her.
I could tell.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.080
So that's it.

32:37.122 --> 32:41.543
Believe me, I don't like her
half as much as I hate you.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.287
You reptile.

32:43.336 --> 32:46.289
Sticks and stones
may break my bones.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.592
I'd like to break every
bone in your body.

32:48.593 --> 32:51.090
You and who else, you big lummox?

32:51.470 --> 32:52.762
Now kiss her, Don.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.466
That's it. More.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.973
Great! Cut!

32:59.936 --> 33:04.312
You couldn't kiss me like that and not
mean it just a teensy-weensy bit.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.690
Meet the world's greatest actor.
I'd rather kiss a tarantula!

33:07.736 --> 33:09.813
- You don't mean that!
- I don't...?

33:09.863 --> 33:12.280
Joe, bring me a tarantula.
Now listen...

33:12.281 --> 33:15.159
Stop that chitchat, you lovebirds.
Let's get another take.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.407
Hold it.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.412
- Hold it, Dexter!
- Hello, Mr. Simpson.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.830
We're really rolling.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.326
Well, you can stop rolling at once.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.286
All right, everybody! Save it!

33:24.294 --> 33:27.168
Save it? Tell them to go home.
We're shutting down.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.965
Don't stand there. Tell them!

33:29.007 --> 33:31.759
Go home until further notice!
What is this?

33:31.760 --> 33:32.927
What's the matter?

33:32.928 --> 33:35.301
<i>The Jazz Singer</i>,
that's what's the matter.

33:35.305 --> 33:38.805
<i>Oh, my darling little mammy
Down in Alabamy</i>

33:38.808 --> 33:42.478
This is no joke. It's a sensation.
The public's screaming for more.

33:42.479 --> 33:45.022
- More what?
- Talking pictures.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.397
- It's just a freak.
- We should have such a freak.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.946
I said talking pictures were a
menace, but no one would listen.

33:51.947 --> 33:56.527
We're going to make <i>The Duelling
Cavalier</i> into a talking picture.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.487
That means I'm out of a job.

33:58.495 --> 34:00.496
I can start suffering and
write that symphony.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.413
We'll put you in as head
of the music department.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.626
Thanks. I can stop suffering
and write that symphony.

34:06.627 --> 34:09.581
Wait a second. Talking pictures!
You should wait...

34:09.589 --> 34:12.130
Every studio's jumping
on the bandwagon.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.882
All the theaters are putting
in sound equipment.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.596
We know nothing about it.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.389
What do you have to know?

34:18.389 --> 34:21.719
You do what you always did.
You just add talking to it.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.853
Believe me, it'll be a sensation.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.143
"Lamont and Lockwood. They talk!"

34:27.148 --> 34:30.522
Well, of course we talk.
Don't everybody?

34:47.668 --> 34:49.670
<i>I got a feeling
You're fooling</i>

34:49.670 --> 34:51.589
<i>I got a feeling
You're havin' fun</i>

34:51.630 --> 34:54.675
<i>I get the go-by
When you are done foolin' with me</i>

34:54.676 --> 34:57.720
<i>It's a holiday
Today's The Wedding of the Painted Doll</i>

34:58.346 --> 35:00.264
<i>It's a jolly day
The news is spreading</i>

35:00.265 --> 35:04.311
<i>Should I reveal exactly how I feel</i>

35:04.352 --> 35:06.350
<i>Should I confess</i>

35:08.398 --> 35:11.397
<i>I got a feeling you're fooling
I got a feeling you're</i>

35:12.902 --> 35:14.604
<i>It's a holiday
Today's The Wedding</i>

35:14.613 --> 35:16.360
<i>Should I reveal</i>

35:16.406 --> 35:18.199
<i>Exactly how I feel</i>

35:24.748 --> 35:25.949
<i>Should I reveal</i>

35:29.961 --> 35:33.711
<i>Beautiful girl
You're a lovely picture</i>

35:33.757 --> 35:37.427
<i>Beautiful girl
You're a gorgeous mixture</i>

35:37.469 --> 35:42.300
<i>Of all that lies
Under the big blue sky</i>

35:43.058 --> 35:44.805
<i>My heart cries</i>

35:44.809 --> 35:46.807
Who's that? She looks familiar.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.729
<i>You're a dazzling eyeful</i>

35:48.730 --> 35:51.433
I featured her before,
in lots of nightclub shows.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.733
I've seen her there.

35:52.734 --> 35:54.686
She'd be good as Zelda's sister.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.443
- That's a good idea.
- Excuse me.

35:58.490 --> 36:03.491
<i>There may be blondes and brunettes
That are hard to resist</i>

36:03.495 --> 36:06.619
<i>You surpass them like a queen</i>

36:07.457 --> 36:11.036
<i>You've got those lips
That were meant to be kissed</i>

36:11.086 --> 36:13.960
<i>And you're over sweet 16</i>

36:15.131 --> 36:18.926
<i>Beautiful girl
What a gorgeous creature</i>

36:18.927 --> 36:22.677
<i>Beautiful girl
Let me call a preacher</i>

36:22.722 --> 36:24.674
<i>What can I do</i>

36:24.724 --> 36:28.849
<i>But give my heart to you?</i>

36:30.605 --> 36:35.436
<i>A beautiful girl
Is like a great work of art</i>

36:35.485 --> 36:38.655
<i>She's stylish
She's chic</i>

36:39.447 --> 36:43.743
<i>And she also is smart</i>

36:45.954 --> 36:48.782
<i>For lounging in her boudoir</i>

36:48.832 --> 36:52.002
<i>This simple plain pajama</i>

36:53.002 --> 36:56.172
<i>Her cloak is trimmed
with monkey fur</i>

36:56.214 --> 36:58.667
<i>To lend a dash of drama</i>

36:59.968 --> 37:01.670
<i>Anyone for tennis?</i>

37:01.678 --> 37:04.848
<i>Well, this will make them cringe</i>

37:06.349 --> 37:08.597
<i>And you'll knock 'em dead at dinner</i>

37:08.643 --> 37:12.222
<i>If your gown just drips with fringe</i>

37:13.481 --> 37:18.482
<i>You simply can't be too modest
At the beach or by the pool</i>

37:19.779 --> 37:22.778
<i>And in summertime, it's organdy</i>

37:22.824 --> 37:25.777
<i>That'll keep you fresh and cool</i>

37:26.703 --> 37:29.247
<i>You'd never guess
what loud applause</i>

37:29.289 --> 37:32.743
<i>This cunning hat receives</i>

37:33.126 --> 37:37.047
<i>And you'd never dream the things
That you could hide</i>

37:37.088 --> 37:39.586
<i>Within these sleeves</i>

37:39.716 --> 37:43.011
<i>A string of pearls
with a suit of tweed</i>

37:43.052 --> 37:45.880
<i>It's started quite a riot</i>

37:46.598 --> 37:49.641
<i>And if you must wear
fox to the opera</i>

37:49.642 --> 37:53.221
<i>Dame Fashion says, "Dye it"</i>

37:53.521 --> 37:56.349
<i>Black is best when you're in court</i>

37:56.399 --> 38:00.604
<i>The judge will be impressed</i>

38:00.862 --> 38:05.488
<i>But white is right
when you're a bride</i>

38:05.533 --> 38:10.864
<i>And you want to be well-dressed</i>

38:13.041 --> 38:15.539
<i>Beautiful girl</i>

38:16.628 --> 38:19.456
<i>For you I've got a passion</i>

38:19.547 --> 38:22.125
<i>Beautiful girl</i>

38:23.176 --> 38:26.129
<i>You're my queen of fashion</i>

38:26.137 --> 38:28.681
<i>I'm in a whirl</i>

38:30.475 --> 38:31.972
<i>Over</i>

38:32.268 --> 38:37.599
<i>My beautiful girl</i>

38:46.658 --> 38:48.575
- That's stupendous!
- Thanks.

38:48.576 --> 38:49.743
Kathy, come here.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.246
This will start a trend
in musical pictures.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.496
Mr. Simpson's thinking about
casting you as Zelda's sister.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.997
That's wonderful!

38:57.001 --> 38:58.453
Hey, Kathy!

38:58.586 --> 39:00.038
That's Kathy Selden.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.790
Thanks anyway. It was nice of you.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.917
- Wait a minute.
- That's all right.

39:03.925 --> 39:07.049
Before Mr. Lockwood refreshes your
memory, you may as well know...

39:07.095 --> 39:12.301
I'm the girl who hit Miss Lamont with
a cake. it was meant for Mr. Lockwood.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.556
Goodbye. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.850
Wait a minute.
What's this all about?

39:16.896 --> 39:20.396
We were gonna use her, but if
it'd make you and Lina unhappy...

39:20.441 --> 39:22.359
Unhappy? It's wonderful.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.104
He's been looking for her!

39:24.153 --> 39:25.855
Are you speaking for Lina also?

39:25.864 --> 39:29.113
The owner of the Coconut Grove
may do what Lina tells him...

39:29.117 --> 39:32.116
- ...but you're the head of this studio.
- Yes, I am.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.997
She's hired. Don't let Lina
know she's on the lot.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.199
Take care of that.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.496
Thank you, Mr. Simpson!

39:37.542 --> 39:41.497
I'm glad you turned up. We've been
looking inside every cake in town.

39:42.964 --> 39:45.258
Is it all right for you
to be seen with me?

39:45.259 --> 39:48.132
You mean, lofty star
with humble player?

39:48.177 --> 39:52.678
Not exactly. But for lunch, don't you
tear a pheasant with Miss Lamont?

39:52.682 --> 39:56.978
Look, Kathy. All that stuff about
Lina and me is sheer publicity.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.769
Oh? Certainly seems
more than that...

39:59.814 --> 40:03.191
from what I've read in all those
articles in the fan magazines.

40:03.192 --> 40:07.989
Ohh, you read the fan magazines?

40:08.031 --> 40:11.451
I pick them up in the beauty
parlor or the dentist's office...

40:11.452 --> 40:13.327
just like anybody.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.780
Honest?

40:16.497 --> 40:18.165
I buy four or five a month.

40:18.207 --> 40:19.875
You buy four or five...?

40:21.044 --> 40:23.121
To get back to the main point...

40:23.171 --> 40:26.250
you achieve a kind of intimacy
in all your pictures...

40:26.257 --> 40:29.176
Did you say all my pictures?

40:31.346 --> 40:34.425
Now that I think of it,
I've seen eight or nine of them.

40:34.474 --> 40:35.675
Eight or nine.

40:35.725 --> 40:38.599
It seems to me
I remember someone saying:

40:38.686 --> 40:42.106
"If you've seen one,
you've seen them all."

40:43.608 --> 40:46.903
I did say some awful things
that night, didn't I?

40:47.195 --> 40:49.818
No, I deserved them.

40:49.822 --> 40:53.572
Of course, I must admit I was
pretty much upset by them.

40:53.952 --> 40:59.204
So upset that I haven't been able to
think of anything but you ever since.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.413
Honest?

41:02.543 --> 41:03.995
Honest.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.548
Well, I've been pretty upset too.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.126
Kathy...

41:10.134 --> 41:12.177
Kathy, look, I...

41:12.220 --> 41:15.048
Kathy, seeing you
again now that I...

41:18.768 --> 41:21.938
I'm trying to say something
to you, but I...

41:21.980 --> 41:23.807
I'm such a ham.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.733
I guess I'm not able to
without the proper setting.

41:26.734 --> 41:27.901
What do you mean?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.445
Well...

41:30.571 --> 41:32.148
Come here.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.579
This is the proper setting.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.499
Why, it's just an empty stage.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.292
At first glance, yes.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.040
But wait a second.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.219
A beautiful sunset.

41:56.097 --> 41:59.050
Mist from the distant mountains.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.475
Colored lights in a garden.

42:05.606 --> 42:10.733
Milady is standing on her balcony,
in a rose-trellised bower...

42:14.365 --> 42:16.408
flooded with moonlight.

42:16.451 --> 42:20.030
We add 500,000
kilowatts of stardust.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.751
A soft summer breeze.

42:26.753 --> 42:28.421
And...

42:29.088 --> 42:31.757
You sure look lovely
in the moonlight.

42:33.134 --> 42:37.214
Now that you have the proper
setting, can you say it?

42:39.140 --> 42:40.387
<i>I'll try.</i>

42:41.809 --> 42:44.637
<i>Life was a song</i>

42:44.937 --> 42:48.016
<i>You came along</i>

42:48.024 --> 42:53.355
<i>I've laid awake the
whole night through</i>

42:54.614 --> 42:57.158
<i>If I but dared</i>

42:57.825 --> 43:00.369
<i>To think you cared</i>

43:00.870 --> 43:02.913
<i>This is what</i>

43:03.164 --> 43:07.540
<i>I'd say to you</i>

43:10.171 --> 43:14.968
<i>You were meant for me</i>

43:18.346 --> 43:23.177
<i>And I was meant for you</i>

43:26.479 --> 43:29.933
<i>Nature patterned you</i>

43:30.191 --> 43:33.565
<i>And when she was done</i>

43:34.529 --> 43:38.450
<i>You were all the sweet things</i>

43:39.242 --> 43:42.286
<i>Rolled up in one</i>

43:42.495 --> 43:44.368
<i>You're like</i>

43:44.372 --> 43:49.578
<i>A plaintive melody</i>

43:52.380 --> 43:57.711
<i>That never lets me free</i>

44:00.721 --> 44:04.141
<i>But I'm content</i>

44:04.892 --> 44:08.847
<i>The angels must have sent you</i>

44:09.605 --> 44:13.435
<i>And they meant you</i>

44:14.443 --> 44:17.772
<i>Just for me</i>

45:44.492 --> 45:48.697
<i>But I'm content</i>

45:49.789 --> 45:54.836
<i>The angels must have sent you</i>

45:55.419 --> 46:01.046
<i>And they meant you</i>

46:02.009 --> 46:06.715
<i>Just for me</i>

46:25.616 --> 46:27.068
Now...

46:27.118 --> 46:32.040
Ta, te, ti, toe, too.

46:32.957 --> 46:37.458
Ta, te, ti, toe, too.

46:37.461 --> 46:38.958
No, no, Miss Lamont...

46:39.046 --> 46:42.250
round tones, round tones.

46:42.300 --> 46:45.595
Now let me hear you read your line.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.132
"And I can't stan' 'im."

46:49.181 --> 46:52.180
And I can't stand him.

46:52.226 --> 46:55.600
"And I can't stan' 'im."

46:55.771 --> 46:57.268
"Can't."

46:57.356 --> 46:58.808
Can't.

46:59.567 --> 47:01.860
"Can't."

47:01.861 --> 47:04.155
Can't!

47:04.322 --> 47:06.865
Can't. Can't.

47:06.866 --> 47:08.318
Very good.

47:08.326 --> 47:11.700
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."

47:11.746 --> 47:13.539
"Around the rocks the rugged..."

47:13.581 --> 47:16.079
No, no. "Rocks." "Rocks."

47:16.125 --> 47:18.626
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."

47:18.627 --> 47:19.828
Very good.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.004
Hi, Don.

47:21.005 --> 47:23.128
- Shall I continue?
- Don't mind me.

47:23.132 --> 47:26.677
Now. "Sinful Caesar
sipped his snifter..."

47:26.719 --> 47:29.843
"seized his knees and sneezed."

47:29.889 --> 47:32.342
"Sinful Caesar snipped
his sifter..."

47:32.391 --> 47:33.683
Sipped his snifter.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.807
"Sipped his snifter."

47:35.811 --> 47:37.137
Oh, thank you.

47:37.188 --> 47:41.689
"Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter,
seized his knees and sneezed."

47:41.692 --> 47:43.644
- Marvelous.
- Wonderful.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.695
Here is a good one.

47:45.738 --> 47:49.442
"Chester chooses chestnuts, cheddar
cheese with chewy chives."

47:49.450 --> 47:51.573
"He chews them and he chooses them."

47:51.619 --> 47:53.867
"He chooses them and
he chews them..."

47:53.871 --> 47:56.915
"those chestnuts, cheddar
cheese and chives..."

47:56.916 --> 47:59.414
"...in cheery, charming chunks."

47:59.460 --> 48:02.379
- Wonderful! Do another one.
- Thank you.

48:02.838 --> 48:05.882
"Moses supposes his
toeses are roses..."

48:05.925 --> 48:08.802
"but Moses supposes erroneously."

48:08.803 --> 48:11.506
"Moses, he knowses his
toeses aren't roses..."

48:11.555 --> 48:15.055
"...as Moses supposes
his toeses to be."

48:18.229 --> 48:20.932
"Moses supposes his
toeses are roses..."

48:20.981 --> 48:23.525
"but Moses supposes erroneously."

48:23.567 --> 48:26.771
"But Moses, he knowses
his toes aren't roses..."

48:26.821 --> 48:29.490
"as Moses supposes
his toeses to be."

48:29.532 --> 48:32.201
Moses supposes his
toeses are roses...

48:32.243 --> 48:34.786
but Moses supposes erroneously.

48:34.787 --> 48:36.204
A mose is a mose.

48:36.205 --> 48:37.531
A rose is a rose.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.242
A toes is a toes.

48:40.584 --> 48:43.037
<i>Moses supposes his toeses are roses</i>

48:43.087 --> 48:45.915
<i>But Moses supposes erroneously</i>

48:45.965 --> 48:48.668
<i>Moses, he knowses
His toeses aren't roses</i>

48:48.717 --> 48:51.796
<i>As Moses supposes his toeses to be</i>

48:51.804 --> 48:54.472
<i>Moses supposes his toeses are roses</i>

48:54.473 --> 48:56.891
<i>But Moses supposes erroneously</i>

48:56.892 --> 48:59.720
<i>For Moses knowses
His toeses aren't roses</i>

48:59.770 --> 49:02.814
<i>As Moses supposes his toeses to be</i>

49:02.815 --> 49:05.438
<i>A rose is a rose
Is a rose is a rose is</i>

49:05.484 --> 49:08.278
<i>A rose is what Moses
Supposes his toes is</i>

49:08.320 --> 49:10.943
<i>Couldn't be a lily
Or a taffy daffy dilly</i>

49:10.948 --> 49:13.901
<i>It's gotta be a rose
'Cause it rhymes with "mose"</i>

49:13.951 --> 49:15.403
<i>Moses</i>

49:16.412 --> 49:17.909
<i>Moses</i>

49:18.956 --> 49:20.533
<i>Moses</i>

51:19.326 --> 51:21.528
<i>"A"</i>

51:27.501 --> 51:29.453
All right, here we go.

51:29.503 --> 51:31.713
- Quiet!
- Quiet.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.336
Roll 'em!

51:35.968 --> 51:39.047
<i>Oh, Pierre.
You shouldn't have come.</i>

51:39.096 --> 51:43.176
She's gotta talk into the mike.
I can't pick it up.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.553
Cut!

51:45.561 --> 51:46.933
What's the matter?

51:46.937 --> 51:48.184
It's Lina.

51:48.230 --> 51:51.559
Look, Lina, don't you
remember? I told you.

51:51.609 --> 51:54.562
There's a microphone right there...

51:54.612 --> 51:57.113
- ...in the bush.
- Yeah.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.237
You have to talk into it.

51:59.283 --> 52:01.861
I was talking.
Wasn't I, Miss Dinsmore?

52:01.869 --> 52:06.119
Yes, my dear. But please
remember, round tones.

52:06.123 --> 52:09.623
"Pierre, you shouldn't have come."

52:09.668 --> 52:12.166
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

52:12.212 --> 52:13.584
That's much better...

52:13.589 --> 52:15.506
Hold it a second.

52:15.507 --> 52:17.425
Now, Lina, look.

52:17.426 --> 52:18.843
Here's the mike.

52:18.886 --> 52:21.304
Right here in the bush.

52:21.305 --> 52:22.513
Yeah.

52:22.514 --> 52:24.216
Now, you talk towards it.

52:24.266 --> 52:27.470
The sound goes through
the cable to the box.

52:27.519 --> 52:31.349
A man records it on a
big record in wax...

52:31.398 --> 52:35.273
but you have to talk
into the mike first.

52:35.277 --> 52:36.774
In the bush!

52:36.820 --> 52:38.317
Now try it again.

52:38.405 --> 52:39.652
Gee, this is dumb.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.951
She'll get it, Dexter. Don't worry.

52:41.992 --> 52:45.321
We're all nervous the first day.
Everything will be okay.

52:45.412 --> 52:48.115
By the way. You know the
scene coming up where I say:

52:48.123 --> 52:50.246
"imperious princess of the night"?

52:50.250 --> 52:54.045
I don't like those lines. Is it all
right if I say what I always do?

52:54.046 --> 52:56.749
"I love you. I love you.
I love you."

52:56.799 --> 52:59.252
Sure. Any way it's comfortable.

52:59.259 --> 53:00.968
But into the bush!

53:00.969 --> 53:02.178
Okay.

53:02.179 --> 53:03.426
Again!

53:03.430 --> 53:04.973
Quiet!

53:05.140 --> 53:06.717
Roll 'em!

53:19.071 --> 53:20.318
Cut!

53:20.572 --> 53:22.866
We're missing every other word.

53:22.950 --> 53:25.369
You've got to talk into the mike!

53:25.452 --> 53:28.030
Well, I can't make love to a bush!

53:28.080 --> 53:30.328
All right, all right.

53:30.749 --> 53:34.328
We'll have to think
of something else.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.214
What are you doing?

53:41.260 --> 53:43.929
- You're being wired for sound.
- What?

53:43.971 --> 53:48.051
Watch out for those dentalized
D's and T's and those flat A's.

53:48.058 --> 53:50.393
Everybody's picking on me.

53:50.394 --> 53:51.644
Okay, Lina.

53:51.645 --> 53:54.098
Now look at this flower, see?

53:54.148 --> 53:56.191
The mike is in there.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.102
That's it.

53:58.110 --> 54:01.029
The sound will run from it...

54:01.280 --> 54:04.073
through this wire, onto the record.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.402
It'll catch whatever you say.

54:06.410 --> 54:09.784
Now let's hear how it sounds, Lina.

54:10.038 --> 54:12.457
Okay, quiet!

54:12.499 --> 54:14.076
Roll 'em!

54:16.712 --> 54:19.006
<i>Oh, Pierre,
you shouldn't have come.</i>

54:20.299 --> 54:22.718
<i>You're flirting with danger.</i>

54:23.761 --> 54:24.962
What's that noise?

54:25.012 --> 54:26.964
It's picking up her heartbeat.

54:27.014 --> 54:28.716
Swell.

54:29.433 --> 54:30.725
Cut!

54:34.813 --> 54:37.266
That's right. That should do it.

54:37.316 --> 54:38.938
Now, don't forget.

54:38.942 --> 54:41.144
The mike is on your shoulder.

54:41.195 --> 54:45.025
And whatever you say goes through
the wire onto the record.

54:45.073 --> 54:48.322
Now, please, Lina,
talk into the mike.

54:48.368 --> 54:51.868
Don't make any quick movements
or you might disconnect it.

54:51.914 --> 54:53.582
Okay, let's go.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.708
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.536
Roll 'em.

55:00.547 --> 55:04.801
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have come.
You're flirting with danger.

55:04.802 --> 55:07.425
What's this wire doing here?
It's dangerous.

55:21.902 --> 55:23.820
You'd better not go in together.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.941
Lina's probably waiting
right inside the door.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.033
- Oh, how I wish...
- Don't worry.

55:29.076 --> 55:32.780
I'll lead the cheering section
in the balcony. Good luck.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.915
- Mr. Lockwood.
- Hello.

56:08.031 --> 56:10.108
What's that? The storm outside?

56:10.158 --> 56:12.827
It's those pearls, Mr. Simpson.

56:17.875 --> 56:22.421
<i>I am the noblest lady of the court,
second only to the queen.</i>

56:22.462 --> 56:26.337
<i>Yet I am the saddest
of mortals in France.</i>

56:26.383 --> 56:28.426
<i>What is the matter, milady?</i>

56:28.468 --> 56:30.841
<i>I'm so downhearted, Theresa.</i>

56:30.888 --> 56:34.388
<i>My father has me betrothed
to the Baron de Landsfield...</i>

56:34.433 --> 56:36.101
<i>and I can't stand him.</i>

56:37.269 --> 56:38.891
<i>Oh, but he's such a catch.</i>

56:38.937 --> 56:42.732
<i>All the ladies of the court
wish they were in your shoes.</i>

56:42.774 --> 56:45.602
<i>My heart belongs to another...</i>

56:46.153 --> 56:48.276
<i>Pierre de Bataille.</i>

56:48.280 --> 56:52.451
<i>Ever since I met him, I can't
get him out of my mind.</i>

56:52.534 --> 56:55.203
Sounds good and loud, huh?

57:03.253 --> 57:04.670
<i>Oh, Pierre!</i>

57:06.089 --> 57:09.213
<i>You shouldn't have come.
You're flirting with danger.</i>

57:09.301 --> 57:11.720
<i>They will surely find you out.</i>

57:11.803 --> 57:14.756
<i>Your head is much too valuable.</i>

57:14.806 --> 57:18.184
She never could remember
where the microphone was.

57:18.185 --> 57:21.104
<i>'Tis Cupid himself
that called me here...</i>

57:21.188 --> 57:22.731
<i>and I...</i>

57:22.856 --> 57:25.684
<i>smitten by his arrow,
must fly to your side...</i>

57:27.527 --> 57:30.571
<i>despite the threats
of Madame Guillotine.</i>

57:31.198 --> 57:34.242
<i>But the night is
full of our enemies.</i>

57:37.663 --> 57:40.116
What you hitting him
with, a blackjack?

57:40.999 --> 57:43.542
<i>Imperious princess of the night...</i>

57:43.543 --> 57:45.086
<i>I love you.</i>

57:45.170 --> 57:46.917
<i>Oh, Pierre.</i>

57:46.922 --> 57:48.749
<i>I love you.</i>

57:48.799 --> 57:53.219
<i>I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.</i>

57:53.220 --> 57:57.596
<i>I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you!</i>

57:59.393 --> 58:01.937
Did somebody get paid
for writing that?

58:04.898 --> 58:06.565
Sounds like a comedy.

58:06.566 --> 58:09.235
- It's a Lockwood-Lamont talkie.
- What?

58:09.236 --> 58:10.938
This is terrible.

58:18.036 --> 58:19.283
What's that?

58:19.329 --> 58:21.748
The sound. It's out
of synchronization!

58:21.749 --> 58:23.245
Tell them to fix it.

58:23.250 --> 58:24.952
Yes, sir.

58:26.253 --> 58:27.753
<i>What's this? Yvonne?</i>

58:27.754 --> 58:31.382
<i>Captured by Rouge Noir
of the Purple Terror?</i>

58:31.383 --> 58:34.132
<i>Ohh. Oh, my sword!</i>

58:34.136 --> 58:36.805
<i>I must fly to her side!</i>

58:36.847 --> 58:39.141
<i>Yvonne, Yvonne...</i>

58:39.266 --> 58:40.968
<i>my own.</i>

58:41.435 --> 58:44.935
<i>Pierre will save me. Pierre!</i>

58:44.938 --> 58:48.267
<i>Pierre is miles away, you witch.</i>

58:48.650 --> 58:50.568
<i>No, no, no.</i>

58:50.569 --> 58:52.778
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

58:52.779 --> 58:54.652
<i>No, no, no.</i>

58:54.656 --> 58:57.655
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

59:04.082 --> 59:05.374
This is a scream.

59:05.417 --> 59:06.994
Give me pictures like
<i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

59:07.002 --> 59:09.375
"I love you, I love you,
I love you"...

59:11.798 --> 59:14.966
- We're ruined. We're all ruined.
- You can't release this picture.

59:14.967 --> 59:18.388
We're booked to open in six
weeks all over the country.

59:18.472 --> 59:21.599
But you're such big stars,
we might get by.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.802
I never wanna see Lockwood
and Lamont again.

59:23.810 --> 59:25.011
Wasn't it awful?

59:25.020 --> 59:27.689
This is the worst
picture ever made.

59:27.773 --> 59:29.646
I liked it.

59:37.783 --> 59:40.202
Well, take a last look at it.

59:40.285 --> 59:42.533
It'll be up for auction
in the morning.

59:42.537 --> 59:44.159
You're out of your mind.

59:44.164 --> 59:47.117
It's Saturday. No bank will
foreclose until Monday.

59:47.167 --> 59:49.836
- It wasn't so bad.
- That's what I told him.

59:50.170 --> 59:51.872
There's no use kidding myself.

59:51.963 --> 59:56.168
Once they release <i>The Duelling Cavalier</i>,
Lockwood and Lamont are through.

59:56.176 --> 59:58.174
The picture's a museum piece.

59:58.178 --> 59:59.755
I'm a museum piece.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:02.679
Things went wrong with
the sound. Get the technical...

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:04.008
No, it wasn't that.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.686
This is sweet of both
of you, but I...

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.436
Something happened to me tonight.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.935
Everything you said
about me is true.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.648
I'm no actor.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.522
I never was. Just a
lot of dumb show.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.404
I know that now.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.740
Well, at least you're
taking it lying down.

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:24.241
No kidding, Cosmo.

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:27.290
Did you ever see anything as
idiotic as me on that screen?

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:29.083
Yeah. How about Lina?

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.707
Heh. I ran her a close second.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:34.664
Maybe it was a photo finish.
I'm through.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.211
You're not through.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.883
Why, of course not.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.428
With your looks, you could
drive an ice wagon.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.887
- Or shine shoes.
- Block hats.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.385
- Sell pencils.
- Dig ditches.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.183
Or go back into vaudeville.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:49.563
<i>Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
I could jump over the moon up above</i>

01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:51.936
<i>Fit as a fiddle and ready for love</i>

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:56.728
Too bad I didn't do that in <i>Duelling
Cavalier</i>. They might have liked it.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:58.609
- Why don't you?
- What?

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.820
- Make a musical.
- A musical?

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.568
Sure. Make a musical.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:05.950
The new Don Lockwood. He yodels,
he jumps about to music.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.995
The only trouble is that
after <i>Duelling Cavalier</i>...

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:13.207
nobody'd come to see me jump off the
Woolworth Building into a damp rag.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.914
Turn <i>The Duelling Cavalier</i>
into a musical.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:17.795
<i>- Duelling Cavalier?</i>
- Sure.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:20.127
They've got six weeks
before it's released.

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:23.305
Add songs and dances,
trim bad scenes, add new ones.

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:25.090
And you got it.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.391
Hey, I think it'll work.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:28.601
- Of course!
- It's a cinch.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:30.770
It may be crazy, but we'll do it.

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:33.519
<i>The Duelling Cavalier</i>
is now a musical.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.150
- Hot dog!
- Hallelujah!

01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:39.981
Whoopee! Fellas, I feel this
is my lucky day, March 23rd.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.444
- Your lucky day's the 24th.
- What?

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.651
It's 1:30 already. It's morning!

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:48.739
Yes. And what a lovely morning!

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:51.324
<i>Good mornin'</i>

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.791
<i>Good mornin'</i>

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.744
<i>We've talked the
whole night through</i>

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:55.954
<i>Good mornin'</i>

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:57.664
<i>Good mornin' to you</i>

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:02.134
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.837
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:07.015
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:13.263
<i>When the band began to play
The stars were shining bright</i>

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:17.188
<i>Now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say good night</i>

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:20.020
<i>So good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:22.029
<i>Sunbeams will soon smile through</i>

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.907
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.825
<i>And you and you and you</i>

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:29.529
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.289
<i>We've gabbed the
whole night through</i>

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:33.832
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.953
<i>Nothing could be grander
Than to be in Louisiana</i>

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:38.289
<i>In the mornin'
In the mornin'</i>

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.373
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:43.043
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.341
<i>Might be just as zippy
If we was in Mississippi</i>

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:49.425
<i>When we left the movie show
The future wasn't bright</i>

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:53.391
<i>But came the dawn, the show goes on
And I don't wanna say good night</i>

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:55.225
<i>So say good mornin'</i>

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.932
<i>Good mornin'</i>

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.725
<i>Rainbows are shinin' through</i>

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.935
<i>- Good mornin'
- Good mornin'</i>

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:03.028
<i>- Bonjour!
- Monsieur!</i>

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.231
<i>- Buenos dias!
- Muchas frías!</i>

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.317
<i>- Buon giorno!
- A ritorno!</i>

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:09.198
<i>- Guten morgen!
- Guten morgen!</i>

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.746
<i>Good mornin' to you</i>

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:11.464
Olé!

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:13.303
<i>- Toro!
- Toro!</i>

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.747
Hey, we can't make this a musical.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.241
What do you mean?

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:20.958
Lina.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.670
- Lina.
- Lina.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:27.211
She can't act, she can't
sing and she can't dance.

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:29.717
- A triple threat.
- Yeah.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.882
What's so funny?

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:33.886
I'm sorry, I was just thinking.

01:05:33.887 --> 01:05:36.849
I liked her best when the
sound went off and she said:

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.517
"Yes, yes, yes."

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.220
"No, no, no."

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:42.013
"Yes, yes, yes."

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:43.689
"No, no..."

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:45.899
Wait a minute.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.977
I am just about to be brilliant.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:50.446
Come here, Kathy.
Come here. Now, sing.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.197
- Huh?
- I said sing.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.366
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.786
Don, keep your eyes
riveted on my face.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.744
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:01.408
Watch my mouth.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:04.244
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.916
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.543
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.382
Well, convincing?

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.086
Enchanting. What?

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:16.255
Don't you get it?

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.099
Use Kathy's voice.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:21.432
Lina moves her mouth and Kathy
sings and talks for her.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:22.720
That's wonderful!

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.432
- I couldn't let you do it, Kathy.
- Why not?

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.439
You wouldn't be seen. You'd
throw away your career.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:32.111
It has nothing to do with my career.
It's only for this picture.

01:06:32.112 --> 01:06:34.611
The important thing is to save
<i>The Duelling Cavalier...</i>

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:37.410
- ...save Lockwood and Lamont.
- Yeah.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:42.453
Well, all right, if it's only
for this one picture, but...

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.743
- You think it'll get by?
- Of course.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:47.750
It's simple to work the numbers.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:51.254
Just dance around Lina and
teach her how to take a bow.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.960
We'll spring it on R.F.
in the morning.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:56.254
Don, you're a genius.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:58.590
I'm glad you thought of it.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.300
Oh, Cosmo.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:11.353
Good night, Kathy.
See you tomorrow.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:14.693
Good night, Don.
Take care of that throat.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.950
You're a big singing
star now, remember?

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:21.325
This California dew is just a
little heavier than usual.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.948
Really?

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:27.706
From where I stand, the sun
is shining all over the place.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.425
<i>I'm singin' in the rain</i>

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.886
<i>Just singin' in the rain</i>

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:26.348
<i>What a glorious feelin'</i>

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:29.395
<i>I'm happy again</i>

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.024
<i>I'm laughin' at clouds</i>

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:37.072
<i>So dark up above</i>

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.782
<i>The sun's in my heart</i>

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:43.286
<i>And I'm ready for love</i>

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:46.532
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:50.251
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:53.252
<i>Come on with the rain</i>

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:57.542
<i>I've a smile on my face</i>

01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:00.924
<i>I'll walk down the lane</i>

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.424
<i>With a happy refrain</i>

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.471
<i>Just singin'</i>

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:10.263
<i>Singin' in the rain</i>

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.774
<i>Dancin' in the rain</i>

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.612
<i>I'm happy again</i>

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:34.828
<i>I'm signin'</i>

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:38.625
<i>And dancin' in the rain</i>

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.204
<i>I'm dancin'</i>

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:34.078
<i>And singin'</i>

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:38.703
<i>In the rain</i>

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:57.597
Why, that's wonderful!

01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:00.357
We'll keep it secret until
we're ready to release...

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:04.103
just in case it doesn't come off.
I'm worried about Lina.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:06.572
She doesn't like Miss Selden.
There might be fireworks.

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:09.241
Lina won't even know
she's on the lot.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:10.944
Boys, this is great.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.658
<i>The Duelling Cavalier</i> can be saved.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:14.905
Now, let's see.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.582
<i>The Duelling Cavalier</i> with music.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.285
The title.

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:23.002
The title's not right. We
need a musical title. Cosmo?

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:29.462
Hey! <i>The Duelling Mammy.</i>

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.380
No.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.972
I've got it.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:38.263
No.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:41.978
<i>The Dancing Cavalier!</i>

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:43.984
That's it. <i>The Dancing Cavalier.</i>

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:47.647
- Remind me to make you a scriptwriter.
- Thanks. Have a cigar.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.114
Thanks.

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:53.486
Now, what about the story?

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:56.618
We need modern musical numbers.

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:02.829
We throw a modern section into it.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.793
The hero's a hoofer on Broadway.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.419
He sings and he dances.

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:09.301
One night, backstage, he's
reading The Tale of Two Cities.

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.843
A sandbag hits his head.

01:13:10.844 --> 01:13:12.971
He dreams he's back during
the French Revolution.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:15.640
This way, we get in the
modern dancing numbers.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:18.139
But in the dream, we can
still use the costumes.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:21.146
Sensational! Cosmo, remind
me to give you a raise.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.231
- Oh, R.F.
- Yes?

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.809
Give me a raise.

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:37.160
<i>He holds her in his arms</i>

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.993
<i>Would you?</i>

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:40.995
<i>Would you?</i>

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:46.210
<i>He tells her of her charms</i>

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.253
<i>Would you?</i>

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:49.963
<i>Would you?</i>

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:54.597
<i>They met as you and I</i>

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:59.891
<i>And they were only friends</i>

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:04.102
<i>But before...</i>

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:09.688
<i>...the story ends</i>

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:14.572
<i>He'll kiss her with a sigh</i>

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:16.902
<i>Would you?</i>

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:18.992
<i>Would you?</i>

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:23.118
<i>And if the girl were I</i>

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.002
<i>Would you?</i>

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:31.296
<i>And would you dare to say</i>

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:34.087
<i>Let's do the same</i>

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:37.302
<i>As they</i>

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.090
<i>I would</i>

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.138
<i>Would you?</i>

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:51.736
<i>And would you dare to say</i>

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:55.111
<i>Let's do the same</i>

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:57.944
<i>As they</i>

01:14:58.411 --> 01:14:59.111
<i>I would</i>

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:07.127
<i>Would you?</i>

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:15.593
Perfect! That Selden girl is great.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.263
I'm gonna give her a big buildup.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.307
- Swell!
- How much is there left to do?

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.267
- One scene and a number.
- What number?

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:24.687
It's a new one. It's
for the modern part.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.472
It's called "Broadway Melody."

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:30.435
It's the story of a young
hoofer who comes to New York.

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.816
First, we set the
stage with a song.

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:34.275
It goes like this.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:39.577
<i>Don't bring a frown to old Broadway</i>

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:44.328
<i>You gotta clown on Broadway</i>

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:46.666
<i>Your troubles there</i>

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.668
<i>They're out of style</i>

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:53.625
<i>For Broadway always wears a smile</i>

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.006
<i>A million lights</i>

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.678
<i>They flicker there</i>

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:03.180
<i>A million hearts beat quicker there</i>

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:08.352
<i>No skies of gray
On that Great White Way</i>

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:12.609
<i>That's the Broadway</i>

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:13.310
<i>Melody</i>

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.420
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:24.924
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.603
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.951
Shh.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.010
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.096
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:09.639
<i>Gotta dance, gotta dance</i>

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:13.639
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:17.435
<i>Everybody dance</i>

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:20.354
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:23.615
<i>Everybody dance</i>

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:27.036
<i>Out on that Gay White Way
And each merry café</i>

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:30.744
<i>Orchestras play
Taking your breath away</i>

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.663
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:37.501
<i>Everybody sing and dance</i>

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:43.256
<i>Oh, that Broadway rhythm</i>

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:49.846
<i>Oh, that Broadway rhythm</i>

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:55.640
<i>When I hear that happy beat</i>

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:58.897
<i>Feel like dancin' down the street</i>

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:02.898
<i>To that Broadway rhythm</i>

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:04.822
<i>Writhing, beating</i>

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.195
<i>Rhythm</i>

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:07.700
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:09.658
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:11.159
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:14.663
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:56.429
<i>When I hear that happy beat</i>

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.429
<i>Feel like dancin' down the street</i>

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:11.945
<i>When I hear that happy beat</i>

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:15.069
<i>Feel like dancin' down the street</i>

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.547
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:27:44.885 --> 01:27:46.928
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:56.353
<i>Gotta dance</i>

01:27:56.354 --> 01:28:02.527
<i>Gotta dance
Gotta dance</i>

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:35.392
<i>That's the Broadway</i>

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:36.093
<i>Melody</i>

01:28:48.949 --> 01:28:51.777
That's the idea. What
do you think of it?

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:54.912
I can't visualize it. I'll
have to see it on film first.

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:57.616
- On film, it'll be better yet.
- Don't forget.

01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:00.369
Have Selden re-record
all of Lina's dialogue.

01:29:00.377 --> 01:29:02.454
- It's all set up.
- And remember...

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:05.249
don't let Lina know about it.

01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:09.256
All set in there?

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.467
Right.

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:14.511
<i>Nothing can keep us apart.</i>

01:29:14.558 --> 01:29:18.763
<i>Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.</i>

01:29:19.062 --> 01:29:21.185
All right, Kathy. Go ahead.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.483
Nothing can keep us apart.

01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:28.530
Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.

01:29:28.738 --> 01:29:30.906
That's great! Perfect. Cut.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:36.200
Till the stars turn cold.

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:38.949
Oh, Kathy, I love you.

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:43.336
I can't wait till this
picture's finished.

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.999
No more secrecy. I'm gonna
let Lina and everyone know.

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:49.800
Your fans will be
bitterly disappointed.

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:53.722
From now on, there's only
one fan I'm worried about.

01:29:56.933 --> 01:29:58.142
There!

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:01.472
- What did I tell you?
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:05.650
I want that girl off the lot at once!
She ain't gonna be my voice.

01:30:05.651 --> 01:30:07.443
Zelda told me everything.

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:10.484
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.
- Anytime, Don.

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:11.940
Look, Don and I...

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:14.864
Don! Don't you dare call him Don!

01:30:14.868 --> 01:30:18.072
I was calling him Don
before you were born.

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:20.039
I mean... You were kissing him!

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:23.748
I was kissing her. I happen
to be in love with her.

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:28.005
That's ridiculous! Everybody
knows you're in love with me.

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:32.336
Ha, ha. Now look, Lina.
Try and understand this.

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:34.217
I'm going to marry her.

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:37.178
Silly boy. She ain't
the marrying kind.

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:40.226
She's a flirt trying to
get ahead by using you.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:44.848
Well, I'll put a stop to that!
I'm gonna go up and see R.F. right now!

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:46.523
A little late.
The picture's finished.

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:49.068
If she weren't in it,
you'd be finished too.

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:52.239
As far as I can see, she's
the only one who's finished.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:53.523
Who'll hear of her?

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:56.905
Everybody. Why do you think
Zelda's in such a sweat?

01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:58.869
Kathy nearly stole the
picture from her.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:01.150
She's only doing you a favor
in <i>The Dancing Cavalier.</i>

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:04.410
And she's getting full
screen credit for it too.

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:08.379
It'll say on the screen that I
don't talk and sing for myself?

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.503
Of course. What do you think?

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:12.750
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:15.295
There's a whole publicity
campaign planned.

01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:17.009
Publicity?

01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:19.098
They can't make a fool out of me.

01:31:19.099 --> 01:31:21.927
They can't make a laughingstock
out of Lina Lamont.

01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:25.097
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:27.641
Why, I make more money...

01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:30.310
than Calvin Coolidge...

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.403
put together!

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:39.161
"Monumental Pictures enthusiastic
over Lina's singing and dancing."

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:40.411
I never said that.

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:44.617
"Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont, big musical talent."

01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:47.953
You can't pull a switch like this
on the publicity department.

01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:50.289
We were prepared for
the Selden campaign.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.589
Now you do this. At
least keep us informed.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:55.589
Wait a minute. I don't
know anything about this.

01:31:55.593 --> 01:31:57.045
What are we gonna do?

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.254
Nothing.

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:01.804
Absolutely nothing.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:05.140
You wouldn't wanna call the
papers and say Lina Lamont...

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:07.643
is a big fat liar.

01:32:07.731 --> 01:32:09.478
Did you send this stuff out?

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:13.110
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:15.484
You'll never get away
with it. Call the papers.

01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:17.486
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.783
Don't tell me what to do, Lina.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:23.488
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:26.825
I had my lawyer go
over my contract.

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:28.167
Contract?

01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:30.961
And I control my
publicity, not you.

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:32.337
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:32:32.338 --> 01:32:35.587
The studio is responsible for
every word printed about me.

01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:38.887
If I don't like it, I can sue.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:40.217
What?

01:32:40.263 --> 01:32:42.681
I can sue.

01:32:42.682 --> 01:32:45.852
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:50.816
it would be "detrimental and
deleterious" to my career.

01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:54.603
I could sue you for
the whole studio.

01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:57.105
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so.

01:32:57.155 --> 01:32:58.732
Right here.

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:03.494
Contract dated June 8, 1925,
paragraph 34, subdivision letter A.

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:05.743
"The party of the first part..."

01:33:05.789 --> 01:33:07.831
- That's me.
- You win, Lina.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.660
We better take Kathy's
credit card off the screen.

01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:12.211
All right, go ahead.

01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:14.631
Let's just get this
premiere over with.

01:33:14.672 --> 01:33:16.215
Satisfied?

01:33:16.216 --> 01:33:18.919
There's just one little thing more.

01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:23.427
You want me to change the name of
the studio to Lamont Pictures, Inc.?

01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:25.682
R.F., you're cute.

01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:27.726
Now, I was just thinking.

01:33:27.727 --> 01:33:30.430
You've given her a part
in Zelda's picture...

01:33:30.522 --> 01:33:33.225
and you'll give her a
bigger one in the next.

01:33:33.316 --> 01:33:35.018
So, what?

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:37.945
If she's done such a grand
job doubling for my voice...

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:41.529
don't you think she ought
to go on doing just that?

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:44.031
- And nothing else.
- You're out of your mind.

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:47.284
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.290
I wouldn't do that to
her in a million years.

01:33:49.332 --> 01:33:53.036
You'd take her career away.
People don't do things like that.

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:54.791
People?

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:56.922
I ain't people.

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:58.958
I am a...

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:06.723
"A shimmering, glowing star
in the cinema firmament."

01:34:06.724 --> 01:34:08.767
It says so...

01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:10.436
right there.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:27.744
<i>Oh, Pierre, Pierre, my darling.
At last, I've found you.</i>

01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:28.992
<i>Oh, Pierre.</i>

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:32.993
<i>Pierre, you're hurt.
Speak to me, speak to me.</i>

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:37.831
<i>I'll kiss her with a sigh</i>

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:40.421
<i>Would you?</i>

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:42.593
<i>Would you?</i>

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:46.932
<i>And if the girl were I</i>

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:48.762
<i>Would you?</i>

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.348
<i>Would you?</i>

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:55.103
<i>Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.</i>

01:34:55.106 --> 01:34:56.603
Lockwood's a sensation.

01:34:56.608 --> 01:35:00.483
Yes, but Lamont! What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous?

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.273
- It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:07.827
<i>Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.</i>

01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:13.123
<i>And would you dare to say</i>

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:18.501
<i>Let's do the same as they</i>

01:35:19.756 --> 01:35:20.456
<i>I would</i>

01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:29.345
<i>Would you?</i>

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:54.498
R.F., it's a real smash.

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:57.418
- Congratulations. We owe you a lot.
- Thank you.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.537
- Kathy, we made it!
- It's a miracle!

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:01.581
It's great, Don. Just great.

01:36:01.631 --> 01:36:04.710
You were fabulous. You sang
as well as Kathy Selden.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:07.844
And I'm gonna for a long time.

01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:09.046
What do you mean?

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:12.551
I mean she's gonna go
right on singing for me.

01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:13.934
Listen, Lina.

01:36:14.018 --> 01:36:17.893
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls.

01:36:17.897 --> 01:36:21.226
Kathy has her own career.
She only did this for this picture.

01:36:21.317 --> 01:36:22.894
That's what you think.

01:36:22.902 --> 01:36:24.729
Come on, come on.

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:27.240
- Lina's getting carried away.
- Yeah, she is.

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:28.900
Listen, you boa constrictor.

01:36:28.992 --> 01:36:31.945
Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her!

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:34.580
Never mind, R.F.!
Listen to that applause.

01:36:34.664 --> 01:36:36.457
Wait till the money rolls in.

01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:40.624
You won't give all that up because
a nobody don't wanna be my voice.

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:42.835
She's got something.
It's a gold mine.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.208
Part of that choice is mine.

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:46.713
And I just won't do it.

01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:50.548
You've got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.

01:36:50.555 --> 01:36:53.258
What's the matter?
Why don't you tell her off?

01:36:53.266 --> 01:36:55.343
I'm confused.
This thing is so big...

01:36:55.393 --> 01:36:58.767
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.

01:36:58.771 --> 01:37:01.231
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:04.777
Listen! I'm an avalanche!
Selden, you're stuck.

01:37:04.861 --> 01:37:08.279
If this happens, get a new boy.
I won't stand for it.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.906
Who needs you? They'd come to see
me if I played opposite a monkey!

01:37:11.909 --> 01:37:13.452
Don's a smash too.

01:37:13.536 --> 01:37:16.285
I'll say a few words.
I'm still running the studio.

01:37:16.289 --> 01:37:17.956
I'm not so sure!

01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:21.457
You're Mr. Producer, always
running things, running me.

01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:25.131
From now on, as far as I'm
concerned, I'm running things.

01:37:25.214 --> 01:37:27.712
- Lina Lamont Pictures, Inc., huh?
- Yeah.

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.635
You've gone a little too far.

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:32.130
- They're yelling for a speech.
- A speech?

01:37:32.221 --> 01:37:35.265
Yeah, everybody's always
making speeches for me.

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:39.812
Tonight, I'm gonna do my own talking.
I'm gonna make the speech!

01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:42.975
- No, please!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:47.146
This is Lina's big night and she's
entitled to do the talking.

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:50.649
- Right?
- Right.

01:37:55.328 --> 01:37:57.621
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:57.622 --> 01:37:58.914
I can't tell you...

01:37:58.915 --> 01:38:01.288
how thrilled we are
at your reception...

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:05.497
for <i>The Dancing Cavalier</i>,
our first musical picture together.

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:10.043
If we bring a little joy
into your humdrum lives...

01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:12.553
it makes us feel as
though our hard work...

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:15.306
ain't been in vain for nothing.

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:18.141
Bless you all.

01:38:18.142 --> 01:38:20.060
She didn't sound that
way in the picture.

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:21.937
Cut the talk, Lina. Sing!

01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:25.732
Sing us a song, Lina. Sing to us.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:28.402
- Please.
- Come on, Lina, sing.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.193
I got an idea. Come here.

01:38:31.197 --> 01:38:32.444
Now, listen.

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:38.654
What am I gonna do?

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:41.831
We've got it. Get a mike set
up back of that curtain.

01:38:41.832 --> 01:38:45.376
Kathy, come here. Kathy will
stand back of there and sing.

01:38:45.377 --> 01:38:49.046
She'll be back of the curtain
singing, and I'll be in front...

01:38:49.047 --> 01:38:50.966
- Like in the picture?
- Right.

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:53.051
You've gotta do it.
This is too big.

01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:57.223
She's got a five-year contract
with me. Get over to that mike.

01:38:57.265 --> 01:38:59.718
You heard him, Kathy. Now do it!

01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:01.181
I'll do it, Don.

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:03.228
But I never want to
see you again...

01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:05.355
on or off the screen.

01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:07.229
Now, come on, Lina.

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:13.523
What are you gonna sing?

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:18.532
"Singin' in the Rain."

01:39:19.704 --> 01:39:21.121
"Singin' in the Rain."

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:23.283
"Singin' in the Rain."

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:24.700
In what key?

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:28.920
A-flat.

01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:30.213
A-flat.

01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:32.375
In A-flat.

01:39:43.436 --> 01:39:48.642
<i>I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain</i>

01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:53.737
<i>What a glorious feelin'
I'm happy again</i>

01:39:53.738 --> 01:39:59.034
<i>I'm laughin' at clouds
So dark up above</i>

01:39:59.035 --> 01:40:02.078
<i>The sun's in my heart</i>

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:04.156
<i>And I'm ready for love</i>

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:06.621
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:09.458
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

01:40:09.462 --> 01:40:14.668
<i>Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face</i>

01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:19.806
<i>I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain</i>

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:23.972
<i>And singin'
Just singin' in the rain</i>

01:40:25.394 --> 01:40:30.316
<i>I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain</i>

01:40:30.608 --> 01:40:35.439
<i>What a glorious feelin'
I'm happy again</i>

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:40.618
<i>I'm laughin' at clouds
So dark up above</i>

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.695
<i>The sun's in my heart</i>

01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:45.573
<i>And I'm ready for love</i>

01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:47.825
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

01:40:49.919 --> 01:40:51.461
Stop that girl!

01:40:51.462 --> 01:40:53.630
That girl running up the aisle!
Stop her!

01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:56.466
That's the girl whose voice
you heard and loved.

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:59.716
She's the real star of the
picture, Kathy Selden!

01:41:06.602 --> 01:41:08.019
Kathy.

01:41:08.813 --> 01:41:12.187
<i>You are</i>

01:41:12.608 --> 01:41:16.858
<i>My lucky star</i>

01:41:17.655 --> 01:41:20.324
<i>I saw you</i>

01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:24.700
<i>From afar</i>

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:32.583
<i>Two lovely eyes
At me they were gleaming</i>

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:37.500
<i>Beaming</i>

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:43.381
<i>I was starstruck</i>

01:41:43.848 --> 01:41:47.848
<i>You're all</i>

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:52.148
<i>My lucky charms</i>

01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:56.693
<i>I'm lucky</i>

01:41:56.694 --> 01:42:01.070
<i>In your arms</i>

01:42:01.657 --> 01:42:05.737
<i>You've opened heaven's portal</i>

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:12.536
<i>Here on earth for this poor mortal</i>

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:15.413
<i>You</i>

01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:18.381
<i>Are my</i>

01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:23.759
<i>Lucky star</i>

01:42:24.305 --> 01:42:30.748
