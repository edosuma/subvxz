00:01.300 --> 00:04.480
mick wolf. You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.250
I feel like I have.That's your mom's jacket.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.570
You look just like her.

00:08.630 --> 00:10.980
One of my best friends,brooke,owns clothes over bros,

00:11.090 --> 00:13.070
and she sent you a gift.

00:14.370 --> 00:18.260
My store was robbed,and I was attacked.

00:18.340 --> 00:19.490
I'm calling the lawyers tomorrow,

00:19.490 --> 00:21.990
and I'm divesting my interests in clothes over bros.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.620
Now you have a company and no daughter.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.550
Whoa!

00:28.070 --> 00:29.420
I'm gonna do this.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.300
Hey,daddy,when you play in the nba,

00:31.390 --> 00:33.350
you should play for the bobcats.

00:34.380 --> 00:37.570
I'm sorry,lucas.I can't marry you.

00:42.340 --> 00:43.650
- I love you.
- Yes.

00:43.670 --> 00:44.810
You didn't let me ask you.

00:44.910 --> 00:46.600
Yes,baby,yes.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.910
Mama!

00:49.060 --> 00:51.120
It's grandpa dan!He's dead!

00:51.150 --> 00:52.860
No,buddy.He's alive.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.620
Grandpa dan is alive,I promise.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.660
Then can we go see him?

00:56.860 --> 00:58.250
I am going to kill you.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.890
But first,I'm gonna get jamie back.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.730
And you're gonna help me.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.350
They say we leave this world

01:19.440 --> 01:21.240
just the way we came into it --

01:21.460 --> 01:23.000
naked and alone.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.350
Put on your clothes,

01:26.510 --> 01:28.820
I know what's under neath

01:30.650 --> 01:33.890
you think you're separate from everyone

01:34.080 --> 01:36.730
but it's just from yourself

01:38.020 --> 01:39.840
So,if we do leave with nothing,

01:40.010 --> 01:42.100
what,then,is the measure of a life?

01:42.750 --> 01:45.280
Is it defined by the people we choose to love?

01:47.690 --> 01:49.300
We are inter-woven

01:49.740 --> 01:51.970
more than you'll ever know

01:52.280 --> 01:54.560
Or is life simply measured by our accomplishments?

01:54.650 --> 01:56.200
So I say

01:56.400 --> 01:57.780
please stop talking to me,

01:58.090 --> 01:59.670
I don't agree

01:59.900 --> 02:03.620
how would you like it?

02:03.720 --> 02:06.070
Oh,shame,shame,shame on you

02:06.210 --> 02:07.800
and your profanity

02:08.169 --> 02:09.419
And what if we fail?

02:09.970 --> 02:12.030
Or are never truly loved?

02:12.670 --> 02:14.370
What then?

02:14.490 --> 02:16.190
Can we ever measure up?

02:16.480 --> 02:20.350
We all fall down now

02:22.430 --> 02:24.210
in the end

02:24.210 --> 02:26.770
Or will the quiet desperation of a life gone wanting...

02:27.860 --> 02:28.930
drive us mad?

02:28.950 --> 02:31.730
But I,for one,am clear

02:31.860 --> 02:35.350
of brothers and sisters

02:39.490 --> 02:41.070
Morning.

02:41.180 --> 02:42.150
Hi.

02:42.180 --> 02:43.890
So,I heard from the church,

02:43.970 --> 02:44.990
and we have a date!

02:45.040 --> 02:46.540
I marked it on the calendar.

02:47.470 --> 02:48.570
That was quick.

02:48.850 --> 02:50.220
That's good.That's great.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.880
Is that okay?

02:52.580 --> 02:53.800
You do still want to get married,right?

02:54.820 --> 02:56.300
Yes.

02:56.430 --> 02:58.050
Right here,right now.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.650
Then,what?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.000
Well,you know how i

03:02.190 --> 03:03.670
have to take the shuttle today to new york

03:03.760 --> 03:05.160
for my book-launch meeting?

03:05.160 --> 03:06.770
Yeah. So?

03:06.780 --> 03:08.330
Well,it's just...

03:09.310 --> 03:11.180
I haven't exactly told lindsey about us...

03:11.970 --> 03:13.130
or the wedding.

03:13.950 --> 03:14.500
Luke.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.160
I know.I should have told her about it by now,but...

03:17.420 --> 03:19.540
that's just not something I can do over the phone.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.390
There you are!

03:24.560 --> 03:25.820
Lucas and I set a date this morning,

03:26.050 --> 03:27.770
so I have to ask you a really big favor.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.010
Okay.

03:30.220 --> 03:32.580
If it's about money,it's probably not the best time.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.700
Oh,god,stop it!

03:33.790 --> 03:35.060
I need a dress!

03:35.150 --> 03:36.060
And if it helps,

03:36.160 --> 03:38.170
I promise to pay full price.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.020
Is my best friend down?

03:40.100 --> 03:41.070
Sure.

03:41.210 --> 03:43.400
Do you want the lindsey strauss tear-away train?

03:43.600 --> 03:46.610
It's what all the runaway brides are
gonna be wearing this season.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.350
So not funny.

03:48.430 --> 03:51.810
No,I was thinking something like
non-traditional,you know?

03:51.820 --> 03:56.500
Like rocker-glam-chic,kind of like,um...

03:56.760 --> 04:00.300
stephanie seymour dress she wears in the guns n'roses video.

04:01.010 --> 04:02.400
Skanky.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.830
I can do that.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.680
Who peed in your cheerios?

04:09.560 --> 04:12.270
I just had a thing with victoria.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.210
I don't mean to take it out on you.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.620
For the record,it is very nice to see you so happy.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.340
Thank you.

04:24.620 --> 04:27.230
Everything is going really good,you know?

04:27.300 --> 04:28.370
It just --

04:28.500 --> 04:30.450
it feels right with lucas,

04:30.450 --> 04:31.580
and the label's taking off.

04:31.630 --> 04:34.010
I have a music legend in my studio right now.

04:34.670 --> 04:35.610
Who?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.440
It's mick wolf!

04:37.960 --> 04:38.880
Cool?

04:38.970 --> 04:40.450
You are so musically challenged.

04:40.450 --> 04:43.820
I guarantee you,you have like 30 songs
on your ipod that he's played on.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.740
And...he knew ellie.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.230
So it's like this window into a world

04:50.240 --> 04:51.420
that I've never gotten to see.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.970
I mean,you can not imagine
what it's like to finally find out

04:54.090 --> 04:56.290
what your mother was like when she was young.

04:57.940 --> 04:59.410
Maybe a little.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.850
Brooke,what happened with victoria?

05:04.060 --> 05:05.460
Nothing.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.880
It's not important.I'm fine.

05:08.980 --> 05:10.830
Let's get to work on the dress,huh?

05:12.000 --> 05:18.074

05:21.130 --> 05:22.580
Yeah,this is him.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.550
Yes,sir.

05:26.690 --> 05:29.260
Uh,yes,sir. I could be there today,if you want.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.370
Absolutely.

05:31.570 --> 05:34.120
I'm -- I'm looking forward to it,too. Thank you.

05:36.740 --> 05:38.010
Everything okay?

05:40.380 --> 05:43.470
That was the general manager for the fort wayne d-league team.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.240
The d-league?

05:45.350 --> 05:46.930
Basketball,mama!

05:46.990 --> 05:48.230
It's justa developmental league team,

05:48.310 --> 05:51.250
but the G.M.Wants to meet with me today.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.450
Ohh!

05:54.130 --> 05:55.730
That was the nba calling.

05:55.820 --> 05:58.210
I told you!You're gonna play in the nba!

05:59.560 --> 06:01.920
My god,baby! Ohh!

06:03.080 --> 06:04.950
Daddy,I'm so proud of you!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.640
Today is the daydan scott dies....

06:17.500 --> 06:19.700
and I get my jamie back.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.100
Need to makesome returns.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.950
Are you kidding?

06:32.190 --> 06:33.870
Those were gifts.

06:33.970 --> 06:36.920
You have a lot of nerve even setting foot in this store.

06:37.030 --> 06:40.380
Last time I checked,it's okay to return gift items.

06:40.460 --> 06:41.890
We not okay.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.100
Just likeit's not okay to steal.

06:44.550 --> 06:45.880
I didn't steal from you.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.670
You didn't give mea chance to pay.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.890
I didn't give youa chance to pay?

06:51.130 --> 06:53.330
When exactly were you planning on paying me?

06:53.450 --> 06:55.990
Was it after you assaulted meand called me a bitch

06:56.090 --> 06:59.420
or maybe after you ran your thieving
little street-urchinass down the block?

07:02.860 --> 07:05.950
Um,excuse me.Can I help you?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.510
Yeah,you can.

07:07.850 --> 07:11.460
I got a work order here to box up all your remaining store
inventory for shipment to new york.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.060
What? Says who?

07:14.110 --> 07:15.670
Victoria davis.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.580
Swell.

07:21.370 --> 07:22.420
It's your lucky day.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.410
Victoria davis,the new president of clothes over bros,

07:25.480 --> 07:29.760
will be happy to give you a full cash refund.

07:36.550 --> 07:38.010
All righty.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.320
Is that a les paul?

07:51.810 --> 07:53.420
Uh,close.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.930
It's a --it's an aristocrat.

07:56.330 --> 07:59.170
Imagine if that guitar could talk,the stories it would tell.

08:00.890 --> 08:02.610
Oh,I don't know.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.170
This baby's been around some pretty crazy stuff.

08:05.260 --> 08:07.660
It's probably best that she doesn't speak.

08:09.930 --> 08:12.860
Was it around when my dad fell in love with ellie?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.120
Yeah. It was.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.160
So,what,was it,like,love at first sight or what?

08:20.810 --> 08:22.450
Pretty much.

08:23.860 --> 08:26.140
I mean,they met on tour,and...

08:26.280 --> 08:27.250
I don't remember which one it was,

08:27.280 --> 08:32.299
but I remember that she fell for your dad instantly.

08:33.950 --> 08:35.570
What about him?

08:35.659 --> 08:37.700
Did he like her right away?

08:38.450 --> 08:40.799
Well...you know,they tried to play it cool,

08:40.880 --> 08:43.100
like it wasn'ta big deal.

08:43.409 --> 08:44.680
But it was.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.120
I mean,everybody knew that they were just meant to be together.

08:52.850 --> 08:55.400
Um,I should probably let you get back to work,huh?

08:55.470 --> 08:56.960
Yeah. Right.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.280
I'm just gonna be right out here if you need anything.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.800
Right. Yeah.

09:14.280 --> 09:18.350
I keep waiting for my breath...

09:19.160 --> 09:20.700
Nathan scott.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.480
Great to meet you.How was your flight?

09:22.580 --> 09:24.640
Oh,it was good,sir.Thanks so much for having me.

09:24.750 --> 09:25.730
It's "bobby."

09:25.780 --> 09:27.630
Hey,I really appreciate you coming up here short notice,

09:27.640 --> 09:29.460
but I wanted you to havea good look at the facility

09:29.700 --> 09:31.780
before we reallyget into things.

09:32.220 --> 09:36.130
As you'll see,everything hereis state-of-the-art.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.870
The owners have sparedno expense.

09:39.790 --> 09:41.230
I see that,sir.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.820
It's just "bobby."Just "bobby."

09:42.910 --> 09:44.340
Come on.Let me show you around.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.650
Make no mistake.We want to win here.

09:49.730 --> 09:51.090
We've got some good player son our squad,

09:51.200 --> 09:52.810
some of whom you'll meet today.

09:52.830 --> 09:53.920
I know that with the right coaching,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.370
we can send some of themto the nba next season.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.760
And all that begins right here.

10:01.410 --> 10:04.330
So,nathan,how does it feel to be ina real gym again?

10:04.430 --> 10:06.460
Good. It feels good.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.550
I bet it does.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.780
Come on.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.810
Mom,the phone's for you.

10:15.610 --> 10:16.890
Yes,hello?

10:17.930 --> 10:19.490
Yes,that's my son.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.600
Yeah,he's very cute.Who I--

10:23.640 --> 10:26.200
I'm -- I'm sorry.Can you repeat that?

10:27.860 --> 10:29.580
Hospice?

10:31.210 --> 10:32.670
Come here,babe.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.320
Yeah.Just a second.

10:42.020 --> 10:44.140
Yes. I understand.Thank you.

10:44.680 --> 10:48.140
And I'm so looking forward to making your acquaintance.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.470
And,of course,meeting your charming son.

10:56.330 --> 10:59.960
Looks like my "sucky" plan isgoing to be a smashing success.

11:05.970 --> 11:09.020
So,what would it like for its last meal?

11:18.020 --> 11:20.090
haley? You okay?

11:22.250 --> 11:23.070
nathan was right all along.

11:23.570 --> 11:26.400
Dan...really has gone off to die.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.290
What do you mean?

11:28.350 --> 11:31.570
I just got a phone call from his hospice nurse.

11:31.770 --> 11:34.510
She thinks it's only a matter of hours now.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.020
I'm so sorry,deb.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.310
Oh. Oh,please.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.830
It's just...

11:43.550 --> 11:45.260
It doesn't sound like dan.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.500
What do you mean?

11:49.620 --> 11:52.130
Well,I would have expected a little more grandstanding,

11:52.210 --> 11:53.240
that's all.

11:54.740 --> 11:57.080
Well,she say she's asking for jamie.

11:57.570 --> 11:59.300
Thinks I should bring him by.

11:59.870 --> 12:00.880
Do you think jamie should see him like that?

12:01.070 --> 12:02.060
I don't know.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.040
After everything he's been through with quentin

12:04.150 --> 12:08.830
and now seeing dan's gravestone,
I promised him he could see his grandfather.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.490
So,what are you gonna do?

12:11.990 --> 12:13.440
I don't know.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.840
Oh,I wish nathan were here.

12:18.230 --> 12:19.670
You're here.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.860
Hey.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.760
So,how was your flight? You ready for today?

12:23.820 --> 12:26.050
Yeah,um...it -- it was fine.

12:26.130 --> 12:26.660
Listen,there's something

12:26.780 --> 12:29.010
I really need to talk to you about. It's important.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.000
And I probably should have talked to you aboutit a while ago,but --

12:31.040 --> 12:34.500
look,I don't want this to be awkward for either of us,all right?

12:35.150 --> 12:36.140
We have to work together,

12:36.260 --> 12:38.730
so let's not dothe heavy emotional thing.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.650
I'll be okay if you're okay. Okay?

12:44.090 --> 12:46.310
Wait till you see what we have planned for you today.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.150
It's gonna be great.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.860
Starting with this.

12:59.990 --> 13:01.610
So,what do you think?

13:03.660 --> 13:05.900
I think it looks amazing.

13:07.030 --> 13:10.610
...Running down my face

13:10.700 --> 13:12.540
so,these are your all-time favorites?

13:13.450 --> 13:14.750
Um,some of them.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.720
Some of them just look really cool.

13:19.190 --> 13:20.400
Hmm.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.200
Okay,five albums...

13:23.390 --> 13:24.440
five that you couldn't live without

13:24.500 --> 13:26.440
if you were stranded on a desert island.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.590
Really?

13:27.680 --> 13:29.100
Show me a person's favorite records,

13:29.290 --> 13:31.010
and I'll tell you everything you need to know about them.

13:31.620 --> 13:33.160
Okay. Fine.

13:33.410 --> 13:36.050
But you're gonna have to write yours down,too.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.800
Okay. It's a deal.

13:48.490 --> 13:50.940
I caught a young girl shop lifting the other day.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.630
I was pretty hard on her.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.270
Did you feel threatened by her?

13:54.390 --> 13:55.750
No.

13:56.420 --> 14:00.510
No,I actually felt myself feeling jealous.

14:01.820 --> 14:03.580
Jealous?

14:03.690 --> 14:06.170
I realize I let the company matter too much.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.930
You know,we spend all this time building something up,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.140
and thenwe don't enjoy it.

14:13.180 --> 14:13.860
We just sit there,

14:14.510 --> 14:17.130
terrified that someone's gonna take it away from us.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.090
And there was this girl,

14:20.470 --> 14:24.740
and she didn't answer to anything or anyone.

14:24.860 --> 14:27.750
And...that made me jealous.

14:29.230 --> 14:30.680
What are yougoing to do about that,

14:30.750 --> 14:32.480
with regards to your company?

14:32.730 --> 14:33.610
Well,it doesn't matter.

14:33.650 --> 14:36.350
I don't have to worry about clothes over bros anymore.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.070
And why's that?

14:38.850 --> 14:40.500
I gave it all away.

14:41.810 --> 14:43.970
I signed the company over to victoria.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.010
Do you regret that?

14:47.310 --> 14:49.280
Away

14:54.410 --> 14:55.930
away

14:56.000 --> 14:57.850
so,you liking what you're seeing so far?

14:58.060 --> 15:00.030
Are you kidding me?It's great.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.690
I got to say,this came out of nowhere.

15:02.770 --> 15:04.180
I'm really,really grateful you called.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.990
No,no.Pleasure's all mine.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.540
I got to tell you,I've had my eye on you for a while.

15:09.090 --> 15:11.420
I watched you win those two championships at gilmore.

15:11.860 --> 15:12.840
I saw you play at maryland.

15:12.930 --> 15:15.610
Well,thank you,but I'm more interested in the future.

15:17.170 --> 15:18.510
Good. I'm glad to hear you say that.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.420
'Cause we could really usea good,young coach like you.

15:24.950 --> 15:26.640
Y-you want me to coach?

15:28.090 --> 15:29.930
No,no. I thought you wanted me to play.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.160
Well,nathan,your playing days are over.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.370
Come on.You must know that.

15:37.060 --> 15:40.470
Away

15:42.280 --> 15:44.710
All right,number three --

15:46.060 --> 15:48.340
oh,that isso predictable.

15:48.690 --> 15:49.730
"Physical graffiti."

15:49.860 --> 15:51.420
Whoa! Whoa!That's cheating.

15:51.530 --> 15:53.830
That's like two albums,really.

15:54.380 --> 15:55.470
Okay,fine.

15:55.590 --> 15:57.680
Number two --"never mind,"

15:57.790 --> 15:59.810
and not just because you played on it.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.660
"Exile on main street,"and that "never mind" thingis a rumor.

16:03.740 --> 16:05.240
Supposedly.

16:05.370 --> 16:07.920
Okay,so that leaves number one.What do you got?

16:08.540 --> 16:09.950
Oh,that's easy.

16:10.060 --> 16:12.080
It is the first record I ever bought --

16:13.120 --> 16:16.250
elvis costello,"my aim is true."

16:18.360 --> 16:19.370
What?

16:28.200 --> 16:29.650
Hey,why do you think,in all this time,

16:30.400 --> 16:32.310
my dad has never reached out to me?

16:34.150 --> 16:35.730
I'm not sure I can answer that --

16:36.310 --> 16:39.470
at least not in a way that's gonna make you happy.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.150
Why'd they give me up?

16:45.070 --> 16:47.030
Peyton,we,um...

16:48.450 --> 16:52.400
I-I mean,all of uswere really screwed up then.

16:52.530 --> 16:54.500
You know,ellie never planned for you,

16:54.620 --> 16:56.950
and you got to understand

16:57.080 --> 16:58.940
that it justnever would have worked.

17:02.050 --> 17:04.270
Hey,I was wondering,um...

17:04.619 --> 17:06.579
if maybe you wanted to come by tonight.

17:06.670 --> 17:09.180
'Cause,hopefully,lucas will get home early,

17:09.280 --> 17:11.890
and I know he would really like to meet you.

17:12.680 --> 17:13.950
And I just...

17:17.680 --> 17:20.069
I was hoping you could tell meall about my parents.

17:20.390 --> 17:22.790
I want to know about my dad.

17:24.079 --> 17:25.970
Be careful what you wish for.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.550
Please.

17:32.530 --> 17:33.910
Okay.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.240
Be there.

17:41.510 --> 17:46.370
And only the heartaches have given me sight

17:46.500 --> 17:48.140
hey,it's nate. Leave it.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.200
Nathan,hi,I'm really sorry to bug you up there,

17:51.580 --> 17:53.970
but,uh...it's about dan.

17:54.080 --> 17:54.880
I need to talk to you.

17:54.970 --> 17:57.730
I got a phone call from his hospice nurse this morning,

17:57.850 --> 17:58.780
and it's not good.

17:58.870 --> 17:59.970
You should call me.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.060
I love you. Bye.

18:03.370 --> 18:05.090
What's a hospice?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.030
Is something wrong with grandpa?

18:09.140 --> 18:10.720
You said he was okay.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.150
I did. I know I did.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.510
it turns out grandpa's really sick.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.710
But he's gonna get better,right?

18:22.660 --> 18:23.970
Come here.

18:27.450 --> 18:29.750
Sometimes people get so sick

18:29.960 --> 18:31.910
that they can't get better.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.840
Is he gonna die,like quentin?

18:38.090 --> 18:39.360
Yeah.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.470
Yeah,I'm afraid so,buddy.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.160
I didn't get to say goodbye to quentin.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.190
Do I get to say goodbye to grandpa?

18:52.320 --> 18:53.950
Yes.

18:54.140 --> 18:55.960
Yes,let's do that.

18:56.540 --> 18:58.590
Come here.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.040
Look,I apologize if we got our lines crossed here.

19:03.110 --> 19:04.170
I just thought that you understood

19:04.230 --> 19:06.090
I was interested in you for the coaching position.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.190
And I-I appreciate it.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.070
I'm flattered,okay?I really am.

19:09.210 --> 19:11.580
But I'm not ready for that yet.I can still play.

19:12.930 --> 19:14.790
Nathan,that was no small injury you suffered.

19:15.510 --> 19:16.760
It was spinal-cord,right?

19:18.030 --> 19:20.260
Yeah.Yeah,it was lower-back.

19:20.740 --> 19:22.910
Well,most guys wouldn't even be thinking about coming back.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.710
They'd just be thinking about walking right.

19:25.770 --> 19:27.260
I'm not most guys.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.440
And I can appreciate that.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.790
Look,I've been rehabbing,okay?I'm in shape. I can play.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.280
You just have to let me show you.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.450
I have the utmost respect for you wanting to play again.

19:39.660 --> 19:41.640
You're a warrior.You always have been.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.830
But I'm looking for a coach.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.630
Now,I've always valued how smart a player you were.

19:48.810 --> 19:50.770
And I know that you've been coaching.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.710
Nathan,this is where your future is.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.230
All right.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.240
I hope that you will think about it.

20:10.110 --> 20:11.910
I know that you will bea great as set here,

20:11.920 --> 20:13.740
very popular,and great for attendance.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.170
I know you'd do a good job.

20:33.210 --> 20:34.330
Hello?

20:34.570 --> 20:36.900
I know you're in the middle of it. I'm sorry.

20:37.050 --> 20:38.610
No,it's okay.

20:38.740 --> 20:42.290
Kind of a break in the action right now. What's up?

20:43.790 --> 20:44.660
Peyton?

20:44.810 --> 20:47.750
Um,nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.870
Peyton,what's going on?

20:52.010 --> 20:55.910
It's mick.He's my father.

20:56.530 --> 20:59.800
Wait. He said that?I mean,he told you?

20:59.930 --> 21:02.750
No,no,not yet.Um,but that's what tonight's about.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.780
He's coming over for dinner.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.710
But you're sure he's your dad?

21:06.850 --> 21:09.340
Yeah,he slipped up,and I just --

21:09.630 --> 21:10.960
I know.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.400
I mean,I-I honestly think I've known since the minute we met.

21:14.540 --> 21:18.160
But...he's my father,luke.

21:18.420 --> 21:20.690
It's gonna be okay,peyton.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.450
You think so?

21:22.570 --> 21:23.900
'Cause I'm kind of nervous.

21:24.030 --> 21:25.360
You're gonna do great.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.280
I just wish I was there.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.970
Luke,they're ready for us.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.620
Hey,I'm sorry,but they need me.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.250
Um,I'll call you as soon as I get out,okay?

21:35.370 --> 21:37.850
- Okay.Luke?
- Yeah?

21:38.600 --> 21:41.190
I always feel better when I get to talk to you.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.690
I love you.Thanks.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.370
Love you too. Bye.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.240
So,there you have it,lucas.

21:54.350 --> 21:56.030
You'll have signing sin all the major markets.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.400
We're looking at a major ad buyin print and radio.

21:58.510 --> 22:01.530
And we're working on all the regional and national talk shows.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.520
That sounds great.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.350
All that's left to discuss is the schedule.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.840
We want you to start strong,so omaha's up first on the 24th.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.680
Your first booksold very well there.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.580
- Next
- um,excuse me.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.960
I have a problem with the chicago date.

22:16.090 --> 22:19.560
We --the schedule's pretty firm at this point.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.650
Yeah,I'm -- I'm sorry,but I can'T.

22:22.790 --> 22:25.100
Lucas,chicago's our second-biggest market.

22:25.230 --> 22:27.300
A change is gonna cost a lot of money.

22:27.400 --> 22:32.130
I understand.But I need to change it,okay?

22:36.500 --> 22:39.680
Luke,can I see you in my office for a second?

22:40.270 --> 22:43.470
Lucas,what are you doing?This book launch is a really big deal.

22:43.620 --> 22:44.680
I know that.I just --

22:44.780 --> 22:47.140
you know they didn't even want to do a book tour?
They didn'T.

22:47.260 --> 22:50.590
But I made them because I believe in you
and I fight for you.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.510
- I appreciate it.
- What could possibly be more important than chicago?

22:53.630 --> 22:54.950
My wedding.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.130
It's peyton.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.930
We're getting married.

23:08.060 --> 23:10.560
And that's why I can't go to chicago.

23:13.230 --> 23:14.820
I see.

23:14.940 --> 23:18.270
I wanted to tell you,okay?But...

23:19.620 --> 23:21.850
then why didn't you?

23:23.580 --> 23:25.350
I just...

23:29.260 --> 23:32.030
I'll talk to themabout chicago.

23:32.690 --> 23:33.940
Lindsey.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.870
I guess I was right all along about you and peyton.

23:43.500 --> 23:47.200
But I wish you could have done this over the phone.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.990
so,do you think I was foolish to give my company to my mother?

23:59.110 --> 24:00.680
Do you think you were foolish?

24:00.790 --> 24:03.750
Do you always answer a question with another question?

24:03.870 --> 24:05.680
Does it bother you?

24:08.750 --> 24:10.920
In my humble opinion,

24:11.060 --> 24:14.330
it was never truly going to be your company
as long as she was part of it.

24:15.130 --> 24:17.050
Yeah.

24:17.510 --> 24:20.110
After I did it,I felt great.

24:20.800 --> 24:25.730
At first,I felt liberated,but now I just...

24:27.050 --> 24:29.300
I feel kind of empty.

24:29.450 --> 24:32.300
Everything that I worked for is gone.

24:32.690 --> 24:35.620
I just have this store.

24:35.710 --> 24:38.590
And even that's empty now.

24:38.740 --> 24:42.640
That freedom you were jealous of can be scary sometimes.

24:42.770 --> 24:44.480
Have you talked to anyone elseabout this?

24:44.610 --> 24:46.630
No.

24:48.090 --> 24:52.770
I saw my best friend today,
and I couldn't bring myself to tell her.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.910
Why do you think that was?

24:55.340 --> 24:56.740
I don't know.

24:58.940 --> 25:01.620
I feel a little...

25:01.750 --> 25:04.840
a little bit like I failed.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.310
You know?

25:08.740 --> 25:11.930
I'm watching all my friends move on with their lives --

25:12.030 --> 25:14.110
haley and her family,

25:14.230 --> 25:15.860
and millicent is moving to be with mouth,

25:15.970 --> 25:19.740
and peyton with lucas --and they're all moving forward.

25:19.860 --> 25:24.370
And it's like I am stuck here,standing still,and...

25:25.000 --> 25:28.230
brooke,you're 22 years old and the founder

25:28.370 --> 25:30.590
of a multi-million-dollar corporation.

25:30.710 --> 25:32.730
I'd hardly call that standing still.

25:32.870 --> 25:34.790
But it's gone.

25:34.910 --> 25:36.800
You'll do something else.

25:36.940 --> 25:39.150
You're intelligent,you're creative.

25:39.260 --> 25:41.320
You'll figure it out.

25:42.450 --> 25:45.870
Right. But what if i don't figure it out?

25:46.260 --> 25:47.690
You will.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.290
But that's not the real question.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.790
Then what is?

25:52.920 --> 25:55.850
All you've talked about is your work,brooke.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.290
But when you mention your friends being happy,

25:58.420 --> 26:02.570
you define that happiness strictly
in terms of relationships and family.

26:02.710 --> 26:07.280
The question is,why are you
so insistent on going through life alone?

26:38.910 --> 26:40.830
so,what do you think?

26:42.760 --> 26:44.910
I don't know.

26:47.050 --> 26:49.610
Listen,letting go of playing is hard.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.730
It was for all of us.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.620
But it doesn't mean you have to let go of basketball.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.480
I have to talk to my family about it.

26:58.930 --> 27:00.440
You do that.

27:00.650 --> 27:03.530
I'll stall for a few days
and wait to hear back from you.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.750
Okay,dad. I'm waiting.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.690
I never meant to hurt you.

27:44.350 --> 27:48.830
Not then...and not now.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.310
I know.

27:51.440 --> 27:54.110
The thing is,I saw it coming all along.

27:54.220 --> 27:56.390
I just tried to wish it away.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.550
It wasn't fair to me or to you.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.710
chicago will be fine.

28:05.830 --> 28:07.860
I'll make it okay.

28:08.090 --> 28:10.000
Thank you.

28:12.490 --> 28:13.980
Well,I should go.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.260
I'm gonna miss my flight.

28:18.570 --> 28:19.640
Okay.

28:22.600 --> 28:23.980
All right.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.540
Lucas.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.970
You forgot something.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.420
lindsey --it's okay.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.070
You know,the first time we met -- right here --

28:41.480 --> 28:44.800
I told you I was pulling for the couple in the book.

28:48.180 --> 28:50.600
goodbye,lucas.

29:09.590 --> 29:11.620
it's not too late,you know.

29:11.770 --> 29:13.620
Too late for what?

29:13.880 --> 29:16.180
To stop all this.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.630
Mm. I'm afraid I can't do that.

29:19.810 --> 29:21.710
Yes,you can.

29:22.580 --> 29:24.320
Please.

29:25.990 --> 29:27.780
I'm begging you.

29:30.150 --> 29:31.780
"Please"?

29:33.200 --> 29:36.050
Where's the big scary guy from the motel,dan?

29:36.160 --> 29:37.750
The guy who was gonna kill me?

29:37.880 --> 29:40.490
I guess you're not so tough
when the shoe's on the other foot.

29:40.620 --> 29:44.460
You touch one hair on jamie's head,
and you'll get to meet him.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.060
You crazy bitch!

29:47.170 --> 29:49.060
Aaah! No! Aah!

29:49.170 --> 29:50.860
Looks like someone needs a little something

29:50.970 --> 29:53.640
to make surethey're on their best behavior.

29:58.610 --> 30:00.460
Sweet dreams.

30:00.980 --> 30:12.480
No.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.740
Well,well.Look who's here.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.600
Okay,pal. I need you to stay in the car.
I'll be right back.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.340
I just want to make sure we're in the right place.

30:38.620 --> 30:40.710
I want to come with you.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.310
Just stay in the car.Keep the doors locked.
I'll be right back.I promise.

30:44.570 --> 30:46.400
Okay.

31:03.250 --> 31:04.800
Dan?

31:05.960 --> 31:07.770
Dan?

31:10.960 --> 31:12.350
Oh,god,dan.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.330
Dan,it's haley!Wake up!

31:14.460 --> 31:15.500
Haley?

31:15.630 --> 31:17.450
Help.

31:17.570 --> 31:18.880
I have jamie with me.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.010
Get jamie.

31:20.110 --> 31:23.660
Dan,what is going on?What happened to you?

31:25.860 --> 31:28.050
Hello,mrs. Scott.

31:39.490 --> 31:42.300
Okay,There you are

32:06.880 --> 32:09.730
Mama.Where are you,mama?

32:16.490 --> 32:19.010
Aah!Hi,jamie!It's me -- nanny carrie.Open up.

32:19.140 --> 32:21.180
No! Mama says you're a bad person!

32:21.300 --> 32:24.340
Oh,that's not true.I love you. Remember?

32:24.470 --> 32:26.760
Now,open the door,buddy.

32:26.870 --> 32:28.610
No! I want my mama!

32:28.730 --> 32:30.950
I am your mama now!

32:31.050 --> 32:33.140
Now,unlock that door this instant!

32:33.230 --> 32:34.290
No!

32:44.280 --> 32:47.790
Looks like somebody needs to learn some manners.

32:58.650 --> 33:00.180
Jamie!

33:14.640 --> 33:16.020
Haley.

33:16.950 --> 33:18.780
Haley,you have to get up.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.630
Haley.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.480
Wake up.

33:24.530 --> 33:26.050

33:27.070 --> 33:28.800
You have to wake up.

33:43.110 --> 33:44.810

33:58.760 --> 34:00.130

34:00.380 --> 34:02.960
I'm sorry I got mad,sweetie!

34:17.300 --> 34:20.100
Just tell me where you are,jimmy-jam.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.760
I won't be mad anymore.I promise.

34:23.920 --> 34:27.719
I've got something special for you.

34:59.670 --> 35:01.390
It's mama.

35:05.950 --> 35:08.770
I'm really sorry to bug you up there,nathan.

35:08.890 --> 35:11.420
I just -- I really need to talk with you.

35:11.530 --> 35:14.920
It's not good. You should call me,okay?I love you. Bye.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.910

35:46.810 --> 35:48.290

35:59.300 --> 36:03.070
Guess there's more than one crazy nanny in this town.

36:04.010 --> 36:05.510
Bitch.

36:09.550 --> 36:11.580
Are you okay?

36:55.550 --> 36:56.850
How's jamie?

36:56.970 --> 36:59.170
He's -- he's scared to death.He's gonna be okay.

36:59.290 --> 37:00.000
How are you?

37:00.100 --> 37:03.040
This was a 1995dom p*ignon ros?

37:03.560 --> 37:06.690
I was saving it for the day I was rid of dan scott for good.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.310
A girl can dream,right?

37:10.430 --> 37:12.300
You saved us.How did you know?

37:12.400 --> 37:13.750
How did you know that we were here?

37:13.870 --> 37:15.590
I knew something was up when I saw the address.

37:15.670 --> 37:17.240
Dan always hatedt he woods.

37:23.420 --> 37:26.600
God,I hate the woods.

37:46.190 --> 37:47.630
Are you okay?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.360
I'm fine. Excuse me.

37:52.490 --> 37:54.300
Uh,just the check,please.

37:54.420 --> 37:56.400
It's taken care of,honey.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.350
What do you mean?

38:12.140 --> 38:14.260
you didn'thave to do that.

38:14.490 --> 38:18.030
Yeah,well,I figureit's your money,anyway.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.350
Besides,I owed you for that shirt.

38:23.740 --> 38:28.640
Well,um...got to bounce. Curfew.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.560
My mom worries if I'm out too late.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.800
It's not a bad thing to have a mom who worries about you.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.160
Yeah.

39:20.610 --> 39:22.630
Just shut up and pour,okay?

40:00.700 --> 40:02.140
hi.

40:03.850 --> 40:05.390
Hi.

40:05.610 --> 40:09.810
I heard there was a great start up company
around here looking forits first employee.

40:13.180 --> 40:16.100
Victoria called me today to fire me.

40:16.900 --> 40:19.270
I guess she didn't know you already did that.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.700
So,what do you say?

40:21.830 --> 40:23.440
You looking?

40:23.560 --> 40:25.070
I might be.

40:25.300 --> 40:29.370
It'll be long hours,horrible pay,

40:29.490 --> 40:31.860
and no job security.

40:32.590 --> 40:34.740
It sounds perfect.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.030
You think you can kill me?

40:59.140 --> 41:02.640
You can't kill me.I'm still here.

41:04.020 --> 41:06.740
I already called the police.They're on their way.

41:06.890 --> 41:09.080
So? What are they gonna do?

41:09.200 --> 41:11.880
I'll get out,and I'll come back.

41:13.310 --> 41:17.230
Do you remember what I told you I'd do
if you ever came near my family again?

41:17.370 --> 41:19.110
I told you I'd kill you.

41:19.580 --> 41:23.240
But you didn'T. I'm not dead.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.530
Sure you are.
