WEBVTT

00:09.208 --> 00:11.833
(Woman) 'It's not that I don't like him.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.917
'But he's gotten so attached.

00:15.083 --> 00:18.208
'I mean, roses every day
after two dates!'

00:18.375 --> 00:20.833
Maggie, first thing you have to do

00:21.042 --> 00:24.875
is sit Gavin down
for a nice long conversation.

00:26.125 --> 00:30.250
Tell him frankly that,
though he wants to go at one speed,

00:30.458 --> 00:33.083
you need to go at another.

00:33.875 --> 00:38.125
Tell him you're not rejecting him,
you are fond of him, but...

00:38.292 --> 00:44.417
I wonder what Roz, my non-PhD-holding
producer, thinks you should do.

00:45.583 --> 00:50.750
Any guy who's that clingy after two
dates has a major insecurity problem.

00:50.917 --> 00:54.042
I say, "Dump him. Now.
And don't look back."

00:54.333 --> 00:57.375
(Maggie)
'It's so good to hear that, Roz.

00:57.500 --> 01:03.292
'That's what I wanted to do, but I felt
so guilty. Thanks so much. Bye.'

01:05.458 --> 01:07.500
That takes us to a commercial.

01:07.750 --> 01:12.625
This, for those who have forgotten,
is the Dr Frasier Crane Show.

01:14.875 --> 01:18.250
I confirmed your dinner reservation
for three.

01:18.417 --> 01:22.125
At your father's request,
that's at Chez Shrimp.

01:22.292 --> 01:27.625
Two letters to sign - a card for
Clarence, the guard, we're all signing,

01:27.792 --> 01:32.833
and a notice on the KACL bowling team
that I'll file in the trash.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.333
Oh, wonderful. Another card.

01:35.458 --> 01:38.875
l, as resident wit,
will have to be clever.

01:39.083 --> 01:43.833
At least I've got another KACL
birthday bash to look forward to.

01:44.042 --> 01:46.917
I can just taste that frozen cake now

01:47.083 --> 01:52.375
and hear wild applause as an adult
snuffs out a handful of tiny candles.

01:53.792 --> 01:57.500
- What are you grousing about?
- Oh, nothing.

01:57.958 --> 02:00.583
(Card plays tune)

02:02.667 --> 02:05.500
Yes, the pageantry never stops.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.458
(Martin) Mr Fancy Pants.

02:14.625 --> 02:18.583
- He's got to buy a German car.
- It's not my fault we broke down.

02:18.750 --> 02:22.583
lf you'd bought American,
they could fix it here.

02:22.750 --> 02:27.375
I always buy American so you can go
to the nearest garage.

02:27.542 --> 02:30.750
I could break down alone
in the middle of Alaska!

02:30.917 --> 02:33.542
A thought to raise all our spirits.

02:34.792 --> 02:40.167
This traffic is murder. We could walk,
but humidity may ruin my loafers.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.417
Does calfskin pucker?

02:42.583 --> 02:45.125
Yes, that's why on humid farms,

02:45.333 --> 02:49.083
the calf is the most made fun of
of all the animals.

02:51.792 --> 02:54.875
Don't be snide.
We'll be here for a while.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.833
Let's try and make
pleasant conversation.

02:58.042 --> 03:01.750
We are a family.
It shouldn't be that hard.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.667
Have you been driving long?

03:08.833 --> 03:11.750
- Not really.
- Got any good stories?

03:11.917 --> 03:14.750
Ever hear of a woman
having a baby in a cab?

03:14.917 --> 03:19.083
- It's a classic.
- Why? Did that happen in this cab?

03:19.250 --> 03:21.875
- It's about to.
- You're pregnant?

03:22.042 --> 03:23.875
Yes. Ow!

03:24.042 --> 03:26.625
Don't panic.
It may be false labour.

03:26.792 --> 03:30.292
My waters just broke.
I'm in a puddle of water.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.208
Calfskin!

03:34.083 --> 03:39.250
- Closest hospital is First Methodist.
- We'll never make it. Pull over!

03:39.417 --> 03:42.292
- Try to park facing downhill.
- Niles!

03:42.417 --> 03:46.708
- I can't have my baby here.
- There's no need to be concerned.

03:46.875 --> 03:50.417
We are trained medical professionals.
Niles, help her!

03:52.708 --> 03:54.750
- Hurry!
- I know.

03:58.208 --> 04:02.917
The other door!
Oh, for goodness sake!

04:03.583 --> 04:05.625
Is anybody there? Come in!

04:05.792 --> 04:09.708
It's most important to breathe deeply.
Do as I do.

04:13.792 --> 04:18.333
- Do you feel faint or short of breath?
- Yes, both of those.

04:18.583 --> 04:23.833
- (Man) 'Hello? Go ahead.'
- Yes, I'm calling from cab No 804.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.250
This is an emergency.
Your driver just went into labour.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.292
We're at the corner
of 14th and Sycamore.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.417
- We need an ambulance now.
- (Man) 'OK.'

04:34.583 --> 04:37.208
- It hurts.
- It's natural.

04:37.375 --> 04:43.375
- No, you're squeezing my hand.
- I only did this once in medical school.

04:43.542 --> 04:48.708
I remember lots of blood and a lino
floor hurtling toward my forehead.

04:48.875 --> 04:52.833
- You fainted?
- Switch places and see how you do!

04:53.042 --> 04:56.292
Good God, Niles!
I'll do this!

04:58.292 --> 05:02.958
- The baby's really coming now!
- When he does come, I'll catch him.

05:03.125 --> 05:05.792
Just continue with your breathing.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.750
Don't feel guilty
for having a baby in a cab.

05:11.875 --> 05:16.792
Nothing to be ashamed of. Many great
Americans have been born this way.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.292
Cab Calloway comes to mind.

05:21.625 --> 05:26.417
I'm a psychiatrist. I specialise
in the head, not the lower body.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.667
It's less messy that way.

05:28.833 --> 05:34.208
Not that your lower portion is messy.
It's beautiful. Not that I'm looking!

05:34.375 --> 05:38.833
- Is the pain that bad?
- No, you're driving me crazy!

05:40.333 --> 05:42.625
Move it out, come on!

05:43.542 --> 05:46.125
- You a doctor, too?
- No, a retired cop.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.792
Well what took you so long?
It's really hurting.

05:50.042 --> 05:52.667
Everything's going to be just fine.

05:52.833 --> 05:57.458
I've delivered a few babies,
and some are older than you are now.

05:57.625 --> 06:02.458
Frasier will hold your hand,
Niles will look out for an ambulance

06:02.625 --> 06:06.000
and I'll help your beautiful baby out.
OK?

06:06.167 --> 06:08.458
- OK.
- Are there any questions?

06:08.625 --> 06:11.167
Should our meter still be running?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.208
(Daphne) Hello? Are you back yet?

06:20.000 --> 06:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:30.250 --> 06:32.292
Well, go on, turn your heads.

06:42.625 --> 06:46.917
OK. So I guess
you've had some excitement tonight.

06:47.167 --> 06:49.208
No, I haven't!

06:52.250 --> 06:57.167
Your father made it sound exciting
on the phone: delivering a baby in a taxi.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.542
I see that not as excitement

06:59.750 --> 07:03.500
but as my duty to use the skills
I honed in medical school.

07:03.708 --> 07:08.083
Yes, Niles ran to a falafel stand
for a pot of hot water.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
I can't get over the feeling of being
there when a person's life begins.

07:14.125 --> 07:18.833
One minute, it's a blob inside some
lady, next minute, it's a person.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.167
Blob - person.

07:22.375 --> 07:26.833
The miracle of birth
summed up in one poetic phrase.

07:27.750 --> 07:31.042
I bet you have fond memories
of your son's birth.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.208
Oh, yes, of course.

07:33.375 --> 07:36.792
The first time I held him in my arms
as a newborn,

07:36.958 --> 07:40.667
it was as if everything else
simply melted away.

07:40.833 --> 07:46.583
There was just a father, a son
and the distant sound of Lilith saying,

07:46.750 --> 07:51.708
"lf you come near me again, Frasier,
I'll drop you with a deer rifle!"

07:52.833 --> 07:56.542
At least now fathers
see their sons being born.

07:56.708 --> 07:59.000
In my day, they stuck us
in the waiting room,

07:59.208 --> 08:02.375
smoking and reading Life magazine.

08:02.542 --> 08:06.083
I remember what I was reading
when Niles was born.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.125
It was about Mickey Mantle.

08:09.292 --> 08:12.000
Talk about life
setting you up for a fall.

08:15.167 --> 08:17.875
- I'm turning in.
- Night, Dad.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.500
I wonder what dreams I'll have
after this talk about childbearing.

08:23.375 --> 08:26.042
Probably the one
where my mother says,

08:26.208 --> 08:30.375
"Daphne, you're 50 and you've
never given me grandchildren."

08:30.542 --> 08:35.417
So I say, "That was my choice.
I was thinking of my career."

08:35.582 --> 08:38.207
"But did you ever think of me?"

08:38.375 --> 08:42.667
"Mother, I don't want
to start this again. Just drop it!"

08:42.832 --> 08:46.542
But will she drop it?
"Oh, shut up, Mother!"

08:49.792 --> 08:53.083
I wonder how many more people
she's got in there.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.042
- Sherry, Niles?
- No, thank you.

09:02.208 --> 09:06.250
- Something on your mind?
- Actually, yes.

09:07.500 --> 09:12.667
For months, I've noticed my thoughts
drifting to the same subject -

09:12.833 --> 09:16.333
will I ever be a father?
There are pros and cons.

09:16.500 --> 09:21.542
But, watching that birth,
I realised it's something I really want.

09:21.708 --> 09:23.708
I think.

09:24.917 --> 09:28.000
It's natural to have
parental stirrings.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.292
I wake up nights thinking about it.

09:31.458 --> 09:33.708
- Have you talked to Maris?
- Not yet.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.833
I like to know what I want
before Maris tells me.

09:40.875 --> 09:44.167
I'm just not sure
I'm ready for fatherhood.

09:44.333 --> 09:50.125
No one is ever sure. These days,
teenagers who want to become parents

09:50.333 --> 09:55.542
are given a sack of flour to keep
for a week, as if it were a baby.

09:55.708 --> 10:00.250
- You're kidding?
- No. They hold it, they care for it.

10:00.417 --> 10:04.458
It gives a good idea
of the responsibility of parenthood.

10:04.625 --> 10:09.542
What could be better than hands-on
experience? Might be worth a try!

10:09.708 --> 10:12.583
- I wasn't...
- Why not? Maris is away.

10:12.792 --> 10:17.750
I'm desperate to resolve the issue.
Where do you keep the flour?

10:18.750 --> 10:20.792
In the kitchen.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.625
The cabinet next to the sink.

10:23.792 --> 10:26.917
Yes, here it is. "Extra-refined."

10:27.958 --> 10:31.458
It's taking after its old man already.

10:31.625 --> 10:35.500
No, that's the sugar.
We're going to do this right.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.750
Now, here is the flour.

10:38.833 --> 10:44.375
"Bleached, 100% fat free, best
when kept in an airtight container."

10:44.542 --> 10:47.458
This one's taking after its mother.

10:59.167 --> 11:02.833
Hello. May I join you?
Or should I say, "May we?"

11:04.250 --> 11:09.333
<i>Mais oui.</i> So you're continuing
with our little baby experiment?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.917
Yes. And it's been
quite a learning experience.

11:13.125 --> 11:16.083
Not easy, though!
I take him everywhere,

11:16.250 --> 11:20.583
get up for 2:00 am feedings,
the whole exhausting nine yards.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.417
What a beautiful baby!
How old is he?

11:23.583 --> 11:26.875
- Eight weeks.
- Great age, isn't it?

11:33.000 --> 11:37.792
Niles? I can't help noticing
that your child has a little boo-boo.

11:38.750 --> 11:42.042
It's nothing.
I was playing him some Brahms.

11:42.208 --> 11:45.458
Never too early to ingrain them.

11:45.625 --> 11:49.167
I must have begun conducting
with a chopstick

11:49.333 --> 11:52.042
and I accidentally ran him through.

11:53.333 --> 11:57.042
What young parent
doesn't tell that story?

12:00.250 --> 12:04.625
The scuffs were the fault
of my new houseman, Ngee.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.083
- What did Ghee do?
- No, it's Ngee.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.417
- Ghee.
- No, no. Ngee.

12:10.167 --> 12:13.042
Oh, who cares? What did he do?

12:13.667 --> 12:17.792
He'd just given my car a shine,
when I sat the baby on the roof

12:17.958 --> 12:20.917
and down it went onto the driveway.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.875
Would you watch him while I order?

12:27.875 --> 12:30.000
(Roz) Hey, Frase. This seat taken?

12:30.292 --> 12:33.083
Well, actually...
No.

12:36.792 --> 12:40.750
Clarence is doing better.
I just dropped his card off.

12:40.958 --> 12:43.417
- Clarence?
- The guard.

12:43.583 --> 12:47.417
Oh, down at the station.
Good. I didn't know he was sick.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.708
You signed his "get well" card.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.083
That wasn't a birthday card?

12:53.250 --> 12:57.125
No, he's in hospital
having a kidney transplant.

12:57.292 --> 13:00.792
Oh, my God!
I thought it was his birthday.

13:00.958 --> 13:05.083
I wrote, "You're not getting older,
just closer to death."

13:09.125 --> 13:12.042
How could you think
it was his birthday?

13:12.208 --> 13:17.792
I didn't recognise the traditional
card for a sick man - a giant bunny.

13:19.417 --> 13:22.625
- Has he read it yet?
- No, he was asleep.

13:22.792 --> 13:26.458
I'll look so callous.
We've got to get that card back!

13:26.625 --> 13:30.792
How can you be leaving?
I asked you to baby-sit!

13:30.958 --> 13:33.792
I have no time for your insanity!

13:33.958 --> 13:37.667
I have to go steal a "get well" card
from a kidney patient.

13:40.708 --> 13:43.667
(Daphne) What does that say "Geb..."?

13:43.792 --> 13:47.042
No, it's "Get".
"Get well soon. Love, Andrea."

13:47.250 --> 13:50.792
Just copy it down
and move on to the next name.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.750
We have to transfer all the names
on to the new card.

13:54.958 --> 13:57.042
I want to get it back tonight.

13:57.208 --> 14:00.875
So you snuck into his room
and stole his card?

14:01.042 --> 14:05.792
I did not sneak in. Luckily, he was
in extreme pain and heavily sedated.

14:05.958 --> 14:09.750
You should have found out
who this Clarence was.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.417
You never pay attention
to the little people.

14:12.625 --> 14:16.042
Yes, why don't we invite
the commoners

14:16.208 --> 14:18.500
to drag me to the square
and stone me.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.250
(Doorbell)

14:20.458 --> 14:24.208
That must be Niles.
He's taking me to the hospital.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.833
- Hello, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

14:40.292 --> 14:45.000
- What are you doing with that?
- Forging a parent-child bond.

14:45.167 --> 14:49.625
That's a relief. I was afraid
it might be something stupid.

14:51.708 --> 14:56.417
I don't wear it in public. But I want
a true picture of parenthood.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.958
- And?
- It's driving me batty.

15:04.458 --> 15:09.000
Feedings every two hours,
constantly monitoring where he is.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.333
You can get obsessed with worry.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.750
Last night, I dreamt
my flour sack was abducted

15:14.958 --> 15:19.458
and the kidnappers
started sending me muffins in the mail.

15:25.875 --> 15:29.208
On the plus side, I've learnt a lot.

15:29.375 --> 15:34.167
lf I ever go through the real thing,
I'll make a wonderful parent.

15:37.375 --> 15:40.542
Niles, what has happened
to your child?

15:41.375 --> 15:43.792
I was practising my t'ai chi

15:43.958 --> 15:48.583
and I accidentally kicked him
into the reflecting pool.

15:49.458 --> 15:53.583
Then I brought him inside
and left him by the hearth to dry.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.667
He caught on fire?

15:59.542 --> 16:01.833
It was not that careless.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.625
A real child would have cried
before it burst into flames.

16:11.125 --> 16:13.083
(Alarm beeps)

16:13.250 --> 16:15.292
Ah! Time for his nap!

16:18.458 --> 16:21.708
- Turn him over if he starts fussing.
- No.

16:23.458 --> 16:27.125
- I'm role-playing, Dad.
- Try the role of a sane person.

16:35.208 --> 16:39.208
So, any closer to making
a decision about fatherhood?

16:39.375 --> 16:43.917
No. One minute, I think
I could never stand the stress,

16:44.083 --> 16:48.417
the next, I'm daydreaming
about taking my son to the museum

16:48.583 --> 16:53.458
or listening to his first "Für Elise"
and I swear there are tears in my eyes.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.958
(Eddie growls)

17:01.667 --> 17:04.333
Oh, dear... Eddie!

17:04.458 --> 17:09.041
(Australian accent)
That dingo's got your baby.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.541
Oh, God! Eddie, Dad!

17:13.291 --> 17:16.500
Don't worry.
I'll clean up that mess.

17:16.666 --> 17:21.458
For God's sake, calm down! I think
it's time you realised something.

17:21.625 --> 17:25.125
That is not a person.
It's a bag of flour.

17:25.291 --> 17:27.583
It's easy to tell the difference.

17:27.750 --> 17:31.167
People don't have recipes
on their backs.

17:31.375 --> 17:35.833
This is stupid!
We're talking about having a baby here.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.458
You make that decision in your gut,
not intellectually.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.125
What is your gut feeling?

17:43.292 --> 17:45.417
- I'm not sure.
- You'd better be.

17:45.583 --> 17:48.542
Nothing can prepare you
for having a kid.

17:48.708 --> 17:52.333
It's hard. Full of surprises.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.500
Maybe your kid
won't want piano lessons.

17:55.708 --> 17:59.083
- He might like baseball.
- Don't even say that.

18:01.167 --> 18:05.083
Just trust yourself.
You'll know if it's right or not.

18:08.708 --> 18:12.667
I'm finished, if you're ready
to take me to the hospital.

18:12.833 --> 18:17.917
I wonder if this experiment
wasn't just a way of convincing myself

18:18.083 --> 18:21.458
I'm ready for something,
when I know I'm not.

18:21.625 --> 18:25.333
- What do you mean?
- I want to have a baby.

18:26.458 --> 18:29.167
But I just don't want it enough.

18:31.667 --> 18:35.583
Oh... That's the hardest thing
I've ever had to admit.

18:35.792 --> 18:40.250
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's so selfish.

18:40.375 --> 18:44.750
I'm the right age,
I have the money, the energy.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.375
It's only selfish to have babies
for the wrong reasons.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.458
People should find out
if they're ready.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.750
Anyway, feeling this way now

18:54.917 --> 18:58.792
doesn't mean things can't change
in a few years.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.750
Perhaps you're right.

19:01.917 --> 19:04.625
Maris and I will be over 40 then.

19:04.792 --> 19:08.875
Maybe we should look into
getting some of her eggs frozen.

19:09.833 --> 19:14.542
Oh, I suspect they're only
a few degrees away from that now.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.042
Who is this Clarence fellow?

19:21.208 --> 19:23.333
Some guy down at the station.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.333
(Music plays)

19:46.375 --> 19:52.292
Dr Crane! It's Clarence!
Were you in there looking for me?

19:52.458 --> 19:56.208
- As a matter of fact, I was.
- They changed my room.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.542
This is so sweet of you.

19:58.708 --> 20:03.417
Clarence is such a fixture, the
station isn't the same without him.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.917
You find the time to come here

20:06.083 --> 20:11.625
while the rest of those bums at
the station don't even send me a card.

20:11.792 --> 20:16.417
Actually, Clarence,
there's an explanation for that.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.583
(Patient) Make the music stop!

20:26.500 --> 20:31.083
You see, the others at the station
don't know you the way I do.

20:31.250 --> 20:34.000
Well, listen,
you get yourself well.

20:34.167 --> 20:38.083
I miss seeing you
every time I walk by the...

20:39.292 --> 20:41.583
...place you tend to be.

20:42.667 --> 20:45.125
Niles!

20:47.500 --> 20:49.542
What are you doing?

20:49.708 --> 20:54.792
Looking at these babies, wondering
if I made the right decision.

20:54.958 --> 20:57.000
- Niles...
- Look at them!

20:57.208 --> 21:00.208
They're healthy, beautiful, lovable...

21:00.333 --> 21:03.167
Flammable.

21:04.167 --> 21:08.333
Maybe I'm more ready
for parenthood than I thought.

21:08.500 --> 21:13.500
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?
- Arleen! And this must be...

21:13.708 --> 21:15.833
Yes, little Nathan.

21:17.917 --> 21:22.917
I'm so glad I ran into you.
We both want to thank you guys again.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.458
Would one of you like to hold him?

21:27.083 --> 21:29.125
Yes, I would.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.208
Oh, he's beautiful.

21:36.208 --> 21:39.250
Yes, why shouldn't you cry?

21:40.125 --> 21:42.375
Everything's so new to you...

21:42.542 --> 21:45.417
So much life to live...

21:45.583 --> 21:49.042
- No, you've got his leg bent back.
- Oh, God!

21:49.208 --> 21:51.875
I'm sorry.

21:52.042 --> 21:55.708
Well, see you, guys.
Say "hi" to your dad for me.

21:56.583 --> 22:01.375
- Perhaps I made the right decision.
- I'd say so. Ready to go?

22:08.167 --> 22:09.542
(Baby murmurs)

22:13.292 --> 22:18.958
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.125 --> 22:20.458
# Mercy!

22:20.625 --> 22:27.167
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:27.333 --> 22:32.958
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.125 --> 22:36.208
# They're calling again #

22:36.417 --> 22:39.042
Good night!
