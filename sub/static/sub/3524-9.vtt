01:16.910 --> 01:17.968
PIZZALAND

01:38.164 --> 01:42.760
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes
the presentation of evidence for today.

01:43.269 --> 01:47.103
I repeat my earlier admonition that you
not discuss the case among yourselves...

01:47.173 --> 01:49.767
or with anyone else, including media.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.646
Your Honor,
I have a logistical problem to discuss.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.806
I'd like to call a witness out of order.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.678
Now I missed the Early Bird Special!

02:00.753 --> 02:04.245
Took half a chicken home the other night.
Got two meals out of it.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.390
Big bombshell from the prosecution today...

02:08.461 --> 02:12.227
with testimony detailing
misuse of Joint Fitters' 401 (k) funds.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.925
- Your reaction?
- No comment.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.491
Mr. Soprano, Allison Pak, Channel Six.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.864
Mr. Soprano, are you hurt?

02:21.941 --> 02:25.240
- Has he been shot?
- He got hit in the head by a boom.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.279
John, I'm at the Federal Courthouse...

02:27.347 --> 02:31.147
where reputed mob boss, Corrado Soprano,
just fell nine...

02:31.217 --> 02:33.185
No, seven steps.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.246
- How's our royal highness in there?
- She's doing good.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.124
Lois, this is Carmela, my wife.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.895
Great to see her run again. Had her
first full-speed workout this morning.

02:47.967 --> 02:51.767
- Go to the fourth stall down, I'll join you.
- What is that, a goat?

02:51.871 --> 02:53.862
Yeah, that's her friend.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.606
Is she ready for the Toboggan Handicap?

03:04.584 --> 03:05.573
Hello.

03:07.387 --> 03:10.845
- She's something, ain't she?
- She is magnificent.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.295
That's a good girl. You're feeling better?

03:16.529 --> 03:19.225
See that? The second she saw you,
she came right over.

03:19.299 --> 03:22.462
She likes it when you rub her muzzle,
right here.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.728
Right, Lady Pie?

03:26.472 --> 03:29.999
You ought to see her race.
She busts her heart to win.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.780
You like the ponies. I'll take you.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.516
Follow my finger.

03:45.091 --> 03:48.390
He said they'll do this every hour.
Check the neurological.

03:48.494 --> 03:51.156
You wanna go? The family's on the way.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.091
Thank you.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.226
My daughter's addressing
the Irish Parliament.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.098
Abortion issues.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.681
I gotta go. I gotta catch a plane.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.714
I'll be back Monday.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.688
- Hope you feel better.
- Make sure Beppy gets my chicken home.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.553
You didn't get to the Early Bird Special.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.558
He was disoriented when he came in.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.462
Scored low on his Folstein,
but that's due to concussion.

04:25.531 --> 04:30.059
- We'll sue the goddamn Justice Department!
- His CAT scan's negative. So far so good.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.863
He didn't seem like himself.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.705
At his age, he might have been
suffering from dementia...

04:37.777 --> 04:40.075
- and the head injury tipped him over.
- Alzheimer's?

04:40.146 --> 04:43.741
That's one form of it.
That's why we want to keep an eye on him.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.410
There's a good chance
this could all go away.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.888
- Where is he?
- They took him down for an X-ray.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.519
We gotta get him into the city.
Columbia Presbyterian Head Trauma Unit.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.857
The best.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.664
Why don't you take it easy?

05:02.101 --> 05:04.763
- Had to be Paulie who told Johnny.
- You think so?

05:04.837 --> 05:06.600
He hates my success.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.738
I keep thinking about that birthday dinner.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.876
Who was there
when I told the Ginny Sack joke?

05:14.947 --> 05:18.075
Not Paulie.
I remember Albert saying he didn't get a gift.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.279
It was Little Paulie,
the witless fucking nephew.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.914
He told Paulie, Paulie tells Johnny.

05:24.123 --> 05:27.115
Fucking telephone game,
like high-school girls!

05:28.528 --> 05:30.621
You wanna play phone games?

05:31.464 --> 05:35.298
That party was the only time
I ever mentioned Shamu's fat ass.

05:37.904 --> 05:41.840
Hello, Verona Green Grove
Retirement Home something...

05:42.208 --> 05:44.904
- Just connect me.
- What the fuck you doing?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.006
Hello?

05:49.816 --> 05:52.910
I'd like to talk to a Mrs. Gualtieri.
She's a resident there.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.179
<i>One moment, please.</i>

06:03.463 --> 06:06.591
<i>- Hello?
- Mrs. Marianucci Gualtieri?</i>

06:08.468 --> 06:12.962
This is detective Mike Hunt, Beaver Falls,
Pennsylvania Police Department.

06:13.072 --> 06:14.562
You have a son, Peter Paul?

06:14.674 --> 06:16.437
Oh, my God, what happened?

06:16.509 --> 06:18.909
<i>He's al right, but he's in a little trouble.</i>

06:19.379 --> 06:22.348
We found him in a public men's room
in Lafayette Park.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.742
<i>l don't know how to put this delicately.</i>

06:24.884 --> 06:26.784
He was sucking a Cub Scout's dick.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.449
No, it's a mistake.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.284
Ma'am, I wish that was all.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.488
We had to have emergency surgery
performed upon arrival at headquarters...

06:38.831 --> 06:42.028
after discovery of a small rodent
in the rectal passage.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.592
- Oh, my God!
- A gerbil, ma'am.

06:44.771 --> 06:47.569
The County does not cover
medical procedures...

06:47.640 --> 06:50.370
deemed caused by criminal sexual activity.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.809
Section 4, paragraph 15.

06:53.045 --> 06:54.740
We'll need an insurance number.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.382
<i>Marone. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield.
Is that all right?</i>

06:58.484 --> 07:02.750
Ma'am, could you hold on for one second?
I have the hospital on the other line.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.063
Uncle Jun'.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.131
- Nephew number one.
- How you doing today?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.197
You look better.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.374
Guess who came in earlier?
Tommy Formicola.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.540
Tommy Formicola died a few years ago.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.775
<i>Not Tommy, you cidrule. The son Tommy!</i>

07:33.853 --> 07:36.822
Jesus Christ, you had me worried there
for a minute.

07:38.157 --> 07:41.923
When you came in yesterday,
they said you were very confused...

07:42.295 --> 07:44.388
you flunked your Holstein or something.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.659
I'm 71 years old, for Christ's sake.

07:46.732 --> 07:49.860
- You get hit in the head, see how you do.
- I'm glad you're better.

07:49.936 --> 07:53.167
Better? This is Xanadu
compared to that courtroom.

07:54.941 --> 07:57.739
I'm milking this thing for all it's worth.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.642
Maybe you're not milking it enough.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.272
What?

08:06.552 --> 08:10.545
You don't have any headaches,
blurred vision, or anything, do you?

08:10.857 --> 08:14.349
- Okay, then.
- Who're you calling? They charge a fortune!

08:21.133 --> 08:22.964
Mel, what the fuck are you doing?

08:23.035 --> 08:26.630
Just on our way to St. Stephen's Green
for dinner. Why? What's going on?

08:27.006 --> 08:29.600
Back here in the States,
I think we got a mistrial.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.433
Son of Gondor!

08:33.712 --> 08:35.738
The bow is meant to find the ring!

08:35.815 --> 08:36.941
Dick!

08:40.753 --> 08:41.741
My turn!

08:46.359 --> 08:50.227
- Mr. Ralph! Come, please, help!
- What?

08:51.564 --> 08:53.054
For Christ's sake, what?

08:53.132 --> 08:56.533
It's Justin, he's hurt very bad!

09:03.509 --> 09:05.067
Justin, baby.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.004
I don't know what to do.
The boy, he comes to the house...

09:10.082 --> 09:11.549
Shut up!

09:13.185 --> 09:16.018
All right, nobody move.
Don't touch him, okay?

09:16.088 --> 09:17.715
I gotta get help.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.245
How is he?

09:43.916 --> 09:47.511
Couldn't get any breath in his lungs
for five minutes...

09:47.587 --> 09:51.148
so there was no oxygen to the brain.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.818
So, they don't...

09:53.926 --> 09:57.225
- They just don't know yet.
- Thank God you were home.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.497
Get to work.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.907
It was an accident, all right?

10:14.413 --> 10:15.778
Just kids.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.485
That must be the surgeon.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.901
Please, allow me to introduce myself.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.836
This is my ex-husband,
Justin's biological father.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.430
He was supposed to take them
to the archery range.

10:42.508 --> 10:46.035
They were playing a video game, Ronnie.
I don't know what happened.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.980
No, nothing's ever your fault.
I should never have let you near him.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.882
- He's my son.
- Before going to your house, he can't sleep.

10:52.952 --> 10:53.941
Ronnie, don't.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.954
- Son of a bitch!
- Please!

10:56.422 --> 10:59.084
- Please! Stop it!
- You scumbag! You son of a bitch.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.626
You bought him the bow and arrow,
you stupid cunt!

11:02.261 --> 11:05.628
Don't you talk to her like that!
Nobody talks to my wife like that.

11:05.698 --> 11:08.223
- Nobody talks to her!
- Knock it off, this is enough!

11:08.300 --> 11:09.289
Nobody!

11:09.435 --> 11:12.461
- We were just fooling around.
- Just fooling around?

11:13.305 --> 11:14.431
Stop!

11:31.357 --> 11:35.350
Our psychiatrist will testify
as to your reduced mental capacity.

11:35.928 --> 11:38.692
Of course, the government
will bring in their own expert.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.232
We get you 24-hour-a-day nursing care...

11:41.300 --> 11:43.791
because they still didn't rule out
the dementia...

11:43.869 --> 11:46.633
you might be a danger to yourself and...

11:46.706 --> 11:48.901
Which only bolsters our case.

11:49.175 --> 11:52.235
If the court finds
you lack fitness to proceed...

11:52.545 --> 11:54.172
the trial will be suspended...

11:54.246 --> 11:58.239
and the charges against you
dismissed with prejudice, or delayed.

11:58.417 --> 12:01.113
I called this woman.
She runs an elder care agency.

12:01.220 --> 12:05.054
<i>She's got an RN that'll play ball.
All you gotta do is act ubatz.</i>

12:05.458 --> 12:07.949
Crazy like a fox, my little nephew.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.385
Now get me the fuck outta here.

12:11.197 --> 12:14.189
This muffin basket
from you and your partners...

12:14.467 --> 12:16.367
It's the least we could do.

12:28.180 --> 12:32.514
- Rosalie, Jesus.
- I didn't know if I should come.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.188
- I don't know what to do.
- I know.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.683
I'm so happy to see you.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.694
How is he?

12:47.266 --> 12:49.166
Not as good as yesterday.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.160
How are you?

12:51.237 --> 12:54.331
I just didn't understand
what you were going through.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.640
I didn't know anything.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.777
I was stupid. I'm sorry.

12:59.678 --> 13:02.203
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

13:03.315 --> 13:07.684
I mean, there's no way to know what it's like
until it happens to you.

13:07.987 --> 13:11.047
You were so strong
when Jackie Junior passed away.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.154
- I don't know how you did it.
- Justin's gonna be all right.

13:15.227 --> 13:17.525
You'll see. He's gonna be fine.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.762
He's gonna be a vegetable.

13:22.835 --> 13:25.827
At least I have a daughter. Ralph's all alone.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.032
I told him he should go
and talk to Father Intintola.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.905
- He should.
- He won't.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.111
There's another one
who should talk to the priest.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.381
- Is it true he took a sleeping pill overdose?
- Apparently.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.613
I also know he and Tony are on the outs,
but Tony's not talking.

13:52.398 --> 13:55.026
First question: What is today's date?

13:56.569 --> 13:59.663
A blonde with big tits
and a hat full of Viagra.

14:00.139 --> 14:02.107
Yeah, cute. Fuck around.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.608
'Cause when that government shrink comes,
you better know how to fake this.

14:06.812 --> 14:08.609
I could do it in my sleep.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.216
- What's your name?
- My name?

14:13.319 --> 14:16.755
You can't not know your name,
or they'll know you're fucking with them.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.016
Listen to this:

14:18.090 --> 14:21.651
"Give the subject a piece of paper,
ask him to draw a circle...

14:21.994 --> 14:24.724
"fold the paper in half, and give it back. "

14:24.797 --> 14:27.459
These demented old bats can't do that.

14:27.900 --> 14:31.666
Maybe you should wipe your ass with
the paper, so they know you're a whack job.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.462
You think this is funny?

14:34.673 --> 14:36.231
I'm a source of amusement.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.606
I pretend to wipe my ass in front of people.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.170
Take it easy.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.737
I lived my whole life with dignity.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.851
Now I gotta pretend
I'm a fucking drooling idiot.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.078
<i>Scumbari'.</i>

14:47.186 --> 14:49.677
It's just a good clean way out. That's all.

14:50.022 --> 14:53.389
My poor fucking brother, Eckley.
How they mocked him.

14:55.527 --> 14:56.926
Suppose it doesn't work?

14:56.996 --> 14:59.988
- We'll go after a juror.
- Suppose nothing works?

15:03.035 --> 15:05.060
Let's do another question.

15:08.507 --> 15:11.943
- Fucking Grand Central Station!
- That must be the nurse.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.641
Maybe she'll give you a sponge bath.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.881
Svetlana! I've been wanting to talk to you.

15:20.152 --> 15:22.518
I bring nurse. I don't come to see you.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.250
I should never have taken your prosthesis.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.253
- But it did bring me to the Lord...
- You're a boring woman.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.865
How are you?

15:35.868 --> 15:37.096
Good to see you.

15:37.169 --> 15:39.865
This is Branca. She is registered nurse.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.067
He is Mr. Tony. This is the uncle.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.142
- Help me up. I gotta go to the bathroom.
- I do it.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.243
- What's your problem now?
- Like anyone would care.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.952
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you doing?

16:01.026 --> 16:03.221
I feel like such a hypocrite.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.163
I haven't been to church in years.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.394
But we had a Mass for Justin's baptism...

16:11.670 --> 16:13.638
for all the good it did.

16:13.973 --> 16:14.962
See?

16:16.141 --> 16:18.769
- What am I doing here?
- God understands.

16:18.877 --> 16:22.836
That's why it's at times like these
he's the only one we can turn to.

16:22.982 --> 16:23.971
God?

16:26.452 --> 16:28.682
My son's lying in the hospital...

16:29.154 --> 16:30.815
hooked up to a machine.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.022
He never did nothing to nobody.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.085
Our Lord gave his only begotten son
to suffer.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.855
Nothing compared to this.

16:40.966 --> 16:45.062
Were you there when Jesus Christ
had his moment of doubt and pain?

16:50.709 --> 16:54.577
It's a great mystery to us
why things happen as they do.

16:55.614 --> 16:59.015
- But God has a plan for all of us.
- Come on, Father.

16:59.718 --> 17:03.176
I've done things in my life
that I shouldn't have done.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.588
He's making my son pay for it.

17:10.429 --> 17:13.421
- That's how he's punishing me.
- God is merciful.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.623
He doesn't punish people.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.602
I would do anything...

17:18.971 --> 17:20.996
if Justin could even walk again.

17:21.073 --> 17:23.233
Justin's in God's hands now.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.575
And I assure you, God loves him very much.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.075
Your job is you...

17:32.317 --> 17:34.615
to get yourself right with God...

17:35.654 --> 17:37.713
for yourself and for your son.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.925
Would you like to make a confession?

17:42.995 --> 17:45.862
I think I need a little more time...

17:47.032 --> 17:48.499
you know, to do a good one.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.000
But when I'm ready...

17:50.569 --> 17:52.036
I understand.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.397
Thank you.

17:54.606 --> 17:55.800
Let's pray.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.013
"Have mercy on me, God, in your goodness.

18:03.215 --> 18:07.208
"In your abundant compassion,
blot out my offense.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.753
"Wash away all my guilt.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.025
"From my sin, cleanse me.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.227
"For I know my offense.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.656
"My sin is always before me. "

18:26.405 --> 18:28.839
- A scholarship at Rutgers?
- That's right.

18:28.907 --> 18:32.843
In Jackie Junior's name, for $20,000.
And that's every year.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.271
Gimme a break.

18:35.347 --> 18:39.681
That's not all. He asked Ro to marry him.
She had the presence of mind to say no.

18:39.751 --> 18:43.915
Although she did say he went to see
Father Intintola, and they had a long talk.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.250
No shit?

18:45.390 --> 18:47.620
I know what you mean about Ralph.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.091
Although, to see him like that...

18:50.696 --> 18:53.096
and Justin hooked up to those machines...

18:57.569 --> 18:59.230
Good morning, you.

19:04.276 --> 19:07.768
- When have I ever asked for French toast?
- Just eat the bacon.

19:07.913 --> 19:11.280
It's unhealthy,
this whole obsession with your weight.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.620
Where were you out so late last night?

19:23.695 --> 19:24.855
Nowhere.

19:25.197 --> 19:27.324
Fooling around with blondie?

19:28.133 --> 19:29.122
Quit it.

19:30.569 --> 19:33.094
- Look at that guilty look on his face.
- Let him eat.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.572
Mr. Tough Guy? Come on.

19:37.643 --> 19:38.837
Jesus.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.412
I have calls to make.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.405
Ton', can I come in?

20:20.452 --> 20:22.386
How's Justin? Any news?

20:24.189 --> 20:28.182
It's the left side of the brain
that affects speech.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.061
Right side of his body.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.328
It's too soon to tell.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.965
Sit down, come on.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.268
You want something to eat?

20:46.478 --> 20:48.605
I just came by to give you...

20:49.348 --> 20:51.714
- from the thing.
- It could've waited.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.552
I had to smack the guy around this morning.

20:56.154 --> 20:57.246
Nice.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.885
At least I'm good for something.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.766
How could I let something like this happen?

21:11.236 --> 21:14.296
It could happen to anybody, Ralph.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.439
You know where I was on his 7th birthday?

21:21.513 --> 21:22.502
Florida.

21:25.417 --> 21:29.046
I was so high on coke, I forgot to call him.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.721
Then I thought I did.

21:34.893 --> 21:38.329
- You cut back on that shit, right?
- I'm a different man.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.762
My poor baby.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.274
My little boy.

22:15.200 --> 22:19.637
Covered by
the Sheetrock and Plasterers Union, right?

22:22.474 --> 22:23.634
Here.

22:43.061 --> 22:47.191
He's covered on her husband's insurance,
as far as that goes.

22:48.934 --> 22:52.461
You know, I'll take care of the rest,
whatever it takes.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.800
I don't care if it breaks me.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.772
He's gonna get the best care there is.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.441
There's something...

23:06.218 --> 23:10.279
I don't want you to hear it
through the grapevine, especially now.

23:14.493 --> 23:17.121
I'm seeing that girl you used to date.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.455
That Valentina.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.739
I gotta go to the hospital.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.276
Hang in there.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.621
Maybe you should go see Pie.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.553
- Take your mind off it.
- I know.

23:51.630 --> 23:56.158
Lois called, and told me about
the Toboggan Handicap, Grade I...

24:00.539 --> 24:03.372
- You look after it. I can't.
- I understand.

24:04.309 --> 24:06.277
Give my best to Carmela.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.506
- She's been a great help.
- I will.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.014
I have bad luck.

24:11.082 --> 24:14.176
I had to get hooked up
with that miserable twat.

24:16.588 --> 24:19.182
Maybe if I'd met a girl like Carmela...

24:20.492 --> 24:23.928
my life could have taken
a whole different trajectory.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.690
See you, Ton'.

24:36.608 --> 24:38.405
How's it going, pal?

24:39.911 --> 24:42.846
Thanks for the flowers. They were beautiful.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.685
That poor fucking guy.

24:52.757 --> 24:55.157
Fuck him and his alligator tears.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.857
His kid's in the hospital.
A little fucking sympathy.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.795
That gives him a pass?

25:00.966 --> 25:04.834
I don't care if he's got 100 kids in the ICU
with arrows in their heads.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.302
He's a piece of shit.

25:06.371 --> 25:10.273
- You know it, and I know it.
- Who got you those no-show jobs?

25:10.375 --> 25:13.276
- And not a word of gratitude.
- He's a saint.

25:13.578 --> 25:16.672
You forget the thousand incidents
with that guy?

25:17.015 --> 25:18.710
Kid in the hospital.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.944
Just take a look at how he fucking earns.

25:21.019 --> 25:24.182
I know it was that miserable prick
who called Ma at the home.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.555
They had to put her on Xanax
just so she could sleep.

25:27.626 --> 25:31.118
She was in the hospital unit for an hour
with nervous bowel syndrome.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.221
Whatever happened there...

25:34.299 --> 25:36.563
- that was fucked up.
- Fucked up?

25:37.569 --> 25:40.595
- You don't know it was him.
- Listen to your friend here.

25:40.672 --> 25:43.470
I'll promise you something else,
on my old man's grave.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.204
If I get proof it was him,
he's a fucking corpse.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.109
Nobody's killing anybody.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.612
All due respect, T...

25:49.681 --> 25:52.149
there's a line in the sand
when it comes to mothers.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.879
You lay a hand on him,
and you're gonna answer to me.

25:54.953 --> 25:58.650
If you can quote the rules,
you can obey them, you hear me?

26:04.062 --> 26:07.293
Don't just look at me. This is a business.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.296
Did you hear what I said?

26:11.536 --> 26:12.628
Yes.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.998
That goes for all of you.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.442
Now, listen.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.707
I'm gonna visit your mother.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.748
That was a terrible thing, whoever did it.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.719
It's been too long now.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.018
I'm gonna go pay my respects.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.520
She'd love that.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.458
All right, come here.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.533
He has no fucking conception.

26:49.507 --> 26:51.134
He's got no kids.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.101
You can't expect him to understand.

26:56.348 --> 27:00.079
I'm going to say three words,
and I want you to repeat them.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.945
Boat, flag, shirt.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.650
Boat.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.118
Shirt.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.928
Let me give you a hint.
We pledge allegiance to the...

27:15.133 --> 27:17.124
United States of America.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.699
Okay, let's move on.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.235
Who is the President of the United States?

27:22.307 --> 27:25.367
- I'm tired, I want to go to the bathroom.
- We're almost done.

27:25.443 --> 27:29.038
- Who is the President of the United States?
- George Bush.

27:29.114 --> 27:32.049
And who was the President
before George Bush?

27:33.585 --> 27:35.052
John Kennedy.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.489
You know where I was when he was shot?

27:39.557 --> 27:41.548
I was getting a haircut.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.371
<i>- Hello?
- l'm sorry to bother you...</i>

27:55.440 --> 27:57.032
but I can't find Ralph.

27:57.108 --> 27:59.303
He keeps to himself nowadays.

28:00.645 --> 28:03.011
There was a fire at the stables...

28:03.848 --> 28:05.543
<i>and they lost some horses.</i>

28:05.617 --> 28:07.710
<i>- Pie-O-My?
- She survived, but...</i>

28:07.786 --> 28:10.084
<i>- Why didn't you tell me? I'm late!
- l'm sorry.</i>

28:10.155 --> 28:14.353
We did everything we could, but she had
to be destroyed. She was too badly burned.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.281
Jesus!

28:46.558 --> 28:48.150
It just went up?

28:48.560 --> 28:51.393
The fire marshal says it looks electrical.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.497
They found pieces of
a blown-out light bulb in a stall...

28:57.235 --> 28:59.863
and the hay was a natural accelerant.

29:00.839 --> 29:05.538
They'll investigate, but it's a formality,
considering the value of the stock.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.408
- No, don't.
- Come on, it's all right.

30:10.775 --> 30:13.073
I was just down at the stables.

30:13.711 --> 30:15.508
I got some bad news.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.910
Pie-O-My.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.279
She was in a fire.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.285
She's dead.

30:28.393 --> 30:30.486
<i>Oh, Marone. Oh, Jesus.</i>

30:36.267 --> 30:40.101
That's why Lois called me.
Four messages I got on the machine.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.329
Three other horses, too.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.734
Jesus.

30:45.610 --> 30:46.975
Look, Ton'...

30:49.414 --> 30:52.781
I just made some coffee,
if you want, eggs...

31:00.592 --> 31:03.186
Sorry about the timing.

31:03.828 --> 31:07.924
No, I actually just
got some good news on Justy.

31:08.433 --> 31:10.993
They think it's just gonna be speech.

31:11.769 --> 31:15.865
The poor kid will have to learn how to talk
all over again. Years of rehab.

31:17.275 --> 31:18.708
That's good.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.311
He'll walk. He'll use his hands.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.515
Life goes on.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.442
One day at a time.

31:27.518 --> 31:30.078
Lois said the horse was still alive...

31:31.289 --> 31:35.282
but it was burnt so bad
that they had to put her out of her misery.

31:35.793 --> 31:38.318
I don't even want to think about it.

31:38.596 --> 31:42.930
At this point,
the fire marshal says it looks accidental.

31:43.034 --> 31:46.526
What sick fuck would
do something like that on purpose?

31:50.475 --> 31:53.035
You know, Ton', Justin loves my eggs.

31:53.177 --> 31:55.372
Sour cream is the secret ingredient.

31:55.446 --> 31:56.640
Right.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.406
What sick fuck?

32:01.586 --> 32:02.678
What?

32:03.288 --> 32:06.587
That's funny about God and fate,
and shit like that.

32:07.358 --> 32:10.259
The horse recovers,
and we take out $200,000 on insurance...

32:10.328 --> 32:12.159
on the race coming up.

32:12.897 --> 32:14.865
Suddenly there's a fire.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.897
What, you think
I had something to do with it?

32:17.969 --> 32:19.061
I didn't.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.901
Anthony, what are you,
a fucking arson investigator now?

32:21.973 --> 32:24.908
Come on,
they said it was an accident, right?

32:26.577 --> 32:29.410
You know what?
Maybe I will have some eggs.

32:31.916 --> 32:33.110
Toast?

32:40.291 --> 32:43.351
How's Corky lanucci?
You heard from him lately?

32:43.761 --> 32:46.992
Sil used him in that restaurant fire.
Excellent work.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.590
You know, I don't understand you, Anthony.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.134
We got lucky.

32:51.636 --> 32:55.663
That accidental fire was a bolt from beyond.

32:56.307 --> 33:00.937
The horse was no fucking good,
with the fucking colic all the time...

33:01.012 --> 33:02.343
and the fucking bills!

33:02.413 --> 33:04.404
What are you saying? She bounced back!

33:04.482 --> 33:08.009
This time! But each time,
it takes something out of them.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.384
It was all downhill from here.

33:10.455 --> 33:13.447
I know it's tragic to think this way...

33:13.524 --> 33:16.084
but you can't argue with the fucking logic!

33:16.160 --> 33:18.060
Jesus Christ, you did it.

33:18.129 --> 33:21.860
- You cooked that fucking horse alive.
- No, I did not!

33:22.300 --> 33:23.961
- But, so what?
- So what?

33:24.035 --> 33:27.527
It was a fucking animal! $100,000 apiece.

33:27.872 --> 33:29.999
My kid's in the fucking hospital!

33:30.074 --> 33:33.237
I don't hear you complaining
when I bring you a nice fat envelope.

33:33.311 --> 33:36.212
You don't give a shit
where that comes from!

33:37.248 --> 33:40.615
Don't give me that look.
It was a fucking horse!

33:41.819 --> 33:43.309
What are you, a vegetarian?

33:43.388 --> 33:46.516
You eat beef and sausage
by the fucking carload.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.700
You fat fuck!

34:34.038 --> 34:38.168
She was a beautiful, innocent creature.
What did she ever do to you?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.813
You fucking killed her.

34:46.951 --> 34:49.043
You fucking killed her.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.621
Fuck!

36:09.934 --> 36:11.526
- Hello.
- It's me.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.497
I need you to call me back
from a pay phone.

36:14.572 --> 36:15.664
Now?

36:16.040 --> 36:17.905
You got three minutes.

36:45.169 --> 36:46.363
<i>lt's me.</i>

36:47.972 --> 36:49.940
I called you half a fucking hour ago.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.733
Adriana put my keys
where I couldn't find them.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.368
<i>Go to the drugstore.</i>

36:54.445 --> 36:56.936
Get two pairs of surgical gloves...

36:57.882 --> 37:01.010
some bleach, come to our friend's house.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.744
The contractor.

37:18.102 --> 37:19.729
What's going on?

37:32.149 --> 37:34.014
I found him like this.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.660
Guy was a piece of shit.

37:43.861 --> 37:47.422
Whoever did this,
it should've happened a long time ago.

37:48.232 --> 37:51.326
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Get rid of the body.

37:56.307 --> 37:59.470
Tried to move him myself, but I couldn't.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.912
Why do we have to get rid of the body?

38:01.979 --> 38:04.311
What, the fucking questions now?

38:05.016 --> 38:07.109
When they find him like this...

38:07.184 --> 38:10.984
and somebody will,
there'll be a major fucking investigation.

38:11.088 --> 38:15.024
We got enough light shining on shit.
Junior's trial, and all that.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.022
No body, no murder.

38:19.130 --> 38:23.089
Can't take him out till after dark,
so we'll get him ready here.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.671
What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:34.745 --> 38:35.973
Nothing.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.451
Don't lie to me. You're high.

38:42.186 --> 38:45.087
I smoked half a joint before you called.
I'm fine.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.592
Look at you, your nose is running,
you fucking junkie.

38:49.126 --> 38:51.458
You promised me
you wouldn't do that shit anymore.

38:51.529 --> 38:52.791
I didn't.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.732
Jesus fucking Christ, can you even do this?

39:14.118 --> 39:15.881
He was a captain, T.

39:16.387 --> 39:18.412
He was the biggest earner.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.159
You gonna lecture me now?
You fucking drug addict!

39:22.226 --> 39:23.454
Not me.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.830
But other people are gonna wonder.

39:38.409 --> 39:39.569
Up!

39:40.444 --> 39:43.072
Get the fucking mop. Get him draining.

39:51.989 --> 39:55.516
Okay, I snorted a little H.
I was out on my collections...

39:55.593 --> 39:59.154
and I just wanted to come down
so I could get some sleep.

40:04.368 --> 40:06.495
See if he's got some Visine.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.202
I'm fucking nauseous.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.738
My eyes are fucking killing me.

40:23.521 --> 40:24.852
Holy shit!

40:25.256 --> 40:27.816
- I had no idea. Did you?
- Of course I did.

40:27.892 --> 40:29.359
You're so high on scag...

40:29.427 --> 40:33.124
you wouldn't know
if he had your mother's muff on his head.

41:11.068 --> 41:14.629
I mean, I got all pissed off
when she said she couldn't have kids.

41:14.705 --> 41:17.435
But this new doctor says maybe she can.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.739
But I don't know if I'm ready.

41:21.912 --> 41:23.641
Don't overthink it.

41:23.781 --> 41:26.477
Either jump in with both feet, or don't.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.787
<i>Leave a message, and make sure
you leave your phone number.</i>

41:32.857 --> 41:36.020
<i>With my schedule,
l cannot look up phone numbers.</i>

41:37.461 --> 41:39.122
I'll tell you one thing:

41:39.196 --> 41:42.097
You can't be high on scag
and have children.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.676
I mean, look at this shit with Justin.

41:57.748 --> 42:00.114
It would fucking ruin your life.

42:00.284 --> 42:03.845
Those kids on milk cartons.
Teenage girls, they run away.

42:04.321 --> 42:06.551
God knows what happens to them.

42:06.624 --> 42:08.216
Killed, I guess.

42:18.002 --> 42:20.061
When it gets a little darker...

42:20.137 --> 42:23.664
I want you to move my car away
and put yours in the driveway.

42:23.741 --> 42:26.938
I wanna finish up
and get him the fuck outta here.

42:31.682 --> 42:32.944
Listen.

42:33.884 --> 42:35.249
About this...

42:36.287 --> 42:37.914
fucking guy.

42:42.159 --> 42:43.683
I came over.

42:44.128 --> 42:45.925
He was still moaning.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.690
He died almost right away.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.633
The ambulance
wouldn't have helped him anyway.

43:01.011 --> 43:04.469
Paulie was in New Paltz all day.
I know that for a fact.

43:04.548 --> 43:05.708
Good.

43:48.058 --> 43:51.027
I heard about your horse, T. I'm sorry.

43:55.099 --> 43:58.068
What the fuck happened over there,
you think?

43:59.903 --> 44:01.131
Tragic.

44:16.387 --> 44:19.447
It was the bowling ball. Fell down the stairs.

44:20.591 --> 44:23.185
Go get it. It'll help weigh him down.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.951
All right, I'm not saying I'm a saint.

45:31.028 --> 45:33.553
I've done drugs when I was younger.

45:35.265 --> 45:36.892
I've even done coke with you.

45:36.967 --> 45:39.458
You're acting like
I'm some kinda skeeve junkie.

45:39.536 --> 45:41.766
I only do it once in a while.

45:41.905 --> 45:44.897
Somebody gave me some
when they didn't have any money.

45:44.975 --> 45:46.135
I'm sorry.

45:47.377 --> 45:51.643
You got your whole life in front of you.
Don't throw it away on drugs.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.681
One, two...

46:00.824 --> 46:01.984
three.

46:27.284 --> 46:28.410
Let's go.

46:28.485 --> 46:32.012
Paulmice's farm
is all the way up in fucking Sloatsburg.

46:55.112 --> 46:57.080
All right, this is good.

46:59.383 --> 47:02.216
- Mikey's old man lives here?
- Retired here.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.578
He's in a VA Hospital now.

47:05.088 --> 47:07.283
He's having prostate surgery.

47:18.001 --> 47:19.400
It's frozen.

47:24.308 --> 47:25.536
Come on.

47:29.813 --> 47:32.247
And there's Artie with three kids.

47:32.883 --> 47:36.546
- Think he's banging that French broad?
- He fucking wishes.

47:38.989 --> 47:41.116
Can you hotwire this thing?

48:15.158 --> 48:16.819
Keep the scoop up!

48:17.194 --> 48:19.492
You gotta put it up to move it!

48:20.764 --> 48:22.857
The scoop, you raise it up.

48:24.668 --> 48:26.226
What the fuck? Put it up!

48:26.303 --> 48:28.828
You gotta put it up to move forward!

48:29.740 --> 48:31.469
What are you doing?

48:31.675 --> 48:34.439
All right, get out. Come on. Get out!

48:37.114 --> 48:38.843
This is what I'm talking about.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.908
That shit fucks up
your hand-eye coordination.

49:12.983 --> 49:14.348
Over there.

49:50.220 --> 49:51.710
All right, move.

50:26.423 --> 50:28.618
Kick leaves and shit over it.

50:32.629 --> 50:35.257
Where did you learn how to drive
one of those?

50:36.466 --> 50:38.798
Grandfather's construction site.

50:39.636 --> 50:42.469
He let me fuck around when I was just 13.

50:42.839 --> 50:44.500
He was a good guy.

51:35.192 --> 51:36.989
Here's the problem...

51:37.160 --> 51:39.890
as I see it, with Ralph getting whacked.

51:41.832 --> 51:44.323
People could take it the wrong way.

51:50.707 --> 51:52.766
What are you trying to convey to me?

51:52.843 --> 51:54.435
Friends of ours...

51:55.112 --> 51:57.205
like it could happen to them...

51:57.280 --> 51:59.043
without, you know...

51:59.716 --> 52:01.809
the protection of the boss...

52:07.424 --> 52:10.416
You're the only other one
that knows about it.

52:27.711 --> 52:30.646
We were right to disappear him.
You're right.

52:31.882 --> 52:33.509
For the business.

52:39.322 --> 52:42.052
Take these out back later and burn them.

53:41.351 --> 53:43.751
- Can I have some ice cream?
- What?

53:48.291 --> 53:49.656
Wait there.

53:57.534 --> 53:59.764
What are you doing? Come here.

54:00.003 --> 54:01.937
Come back here. Come in the house.

54:02.005 --> 54:05.463
- You'll catch cold, come on.
- I was getting the paper.

54:10.347 --> 54:12.474
You'll catch cold. Come on.

54:20.290 --> 54:22.315
I was just getting the newspaper.

54:22.392 --> 54:25.555
It's your fault, you forgot
to get the newspaper this morning.

54:25.629 --> 54:26.994
I make tea.
