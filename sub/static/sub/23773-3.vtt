FILM 3

01:08.320 --> 01:11.040
<i>If you’re following a killer,</i>

01:11.800 --> 01:13.600
<i>you’re already behind.</i>

01:15.520 --> 01:18.200
VERA STEKLOVA - KILLED IN 1999
UNDER UNEXPLAINED CIRCUMSTANCES

01:30.400 --> 01:31.760
How are you?

01:42.640 --> 01:43.840
He’s not normal.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.360
How could they let him join the police?

01:50.080 --> 01:52.800
What is it about this famous method?

01:54.920 --> 01:58.760
How can he catch killers
if he’s sick in the head?

01:58.840 --> 02:00.120
I don’t understand.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.600
What are you going to do next?

02:02.640 --> 02:05.160
-Rest.
-As you should.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.320
Esen.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.600
There is no method.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.920
Meglin catches psychos
because he is one himself.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.280
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

02:32.560 --> 02:33.760
<i>I love you.</i>

02:38.360 --> 02:39.840
Why did you decide to leave?

02:43.760 --> 02:45.360
Well, I thought… What could he do for me?

02:49.720 --> 02:51.480
He wasn’t a detective. He was a psycho.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.000
-I decided to search myself.
-For who?

03:06.640 --> 03:08.040
My mother’s killer.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.920
TOWN OF VASILKOVO

03:37.720 --> 03:39.840
-What?
-What are you listening to?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.040
Just this.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.720
Give it to me.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.320
-Cool song.
-Yeah?

03:52.080 --> 03:53.280
Yeah, awesome.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.280
Hey, where are you going?

03:56.360 --> 03:57.880
Nowhere.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.720
I’ve been fighting with my parents.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.280
There.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.440
-No worries. It happens.
-I don’t know where I’m going.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.640
I got on the first train I found,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.800
and now I need to switch, probably,
and head back.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.280
Hey, maybe you wanna come with me
and have some wine?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.519
Why not?

04:18.480 --> 04:22.040
-We don’t know each other.
-So what?

04:23.440 --> 04:24.640
Come on.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.040
If you really don’t have anywhere to go
and you don’t care, then come with me.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.200
There won’t be anyone at my house
for three days.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.640
VASILKOVO

05:08.640 --> 05:11.040
Listen, I probably shouldn’t go.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.840
What’s wrong?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.000
Are you afraid of him or something?

05:18.040 --> 05:21.680
Old-timer! Can you walk in front of us?
My friend is afraid.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.800
Do you see?
There’s nothing to be scared of.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.440
Don’t touch me, please.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.480
Are you scared?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.640
Everything will be okay.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.640
Hush, hush. Everything will be okay.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.080
We’re going home… daughter.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.360
STEKLOV HOME

08:08.760 --> 08:10.360
CRIMINAL CASE

08:10.440 --> 08:12.480
IN THE MURDER
OF VERA VYACHESLAVOVNA STEKLOVA

09:24.520 --> 09:25.640
I’m shocked.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.560
But that doesn’t change anything.
I’m quitting.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.720
-Five minutes.
-Two minutes.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.200
Did you read everything?

10:05.280 --> 10:06.960
There are some pages missing.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.960
What are you going to do?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.480
Look for them.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.480
TIKHVIN

10:37.600 --> 10:39.000
Sveta Prikhodka.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.960
She got off the commuter train
at Vasilkovo and didn’t make it home.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.800
They combed the woods but didn’t
find a body. She might be alive. We’ll go back there.
You can do as you please.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.520
I need you right now.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.080
All right.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.400
Wish her <i>bon appétit</i>.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.520
Don’t be scared. Here, eat.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.160
I won’t!

11:39.720 --> 11:41.440
Eat, I said!

11:45.480 --> 11:47.840
<i>The cottager and his accomplice</i>

11:47.920 --> 11:50.520
were the primary people
Sasha Khomutova was able to describe.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.160
She managed to escape.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.920
Khomutova ran track since childhood,
so the cottager got tired fast.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.200
The girl did too.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.040
Khomutova went to the police.
According to her description,

12:03.120 --> 12:06.560
the psycho’s companion looked strange,
to say the least.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.840
She was presumed dead,
but she turned out to be alive.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.560
The police first questioned the mother,

12:13.640 --> 12:15.400
but she didn’t know anything.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.680
How did Meglin explain that?

12:18.840 --> 12:20.760
Simple. Love.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.440
Hello!
Inspection regarding underage persons.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.880
-I won’t take my shoes off.
-Investigators were already here.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.960
-Hello. I told them everything.
-It’s our duty. We’re looking at the home.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.440
Where’s your bathroom?

14:22.200 --> 14:24.760
They were friends.
True, they were different.

14:24.840 --> 14:28.240
Nonetheless… kids are kids.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.280
She’ll be here soon
and tell you everything.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.640
-Where is their father?
-He died long ago.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.600
The girls weren’t even a year old.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.840
Excuse us. We’re going to search the room.
All right?

14:52.040 --> 14:53.640
All right, go ahead.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.400
What?

14:56.840 --> 14:59.840
A survey of the residence. What else?

15:00.440 --> 15:01.440
Come on.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.240
What do you see?

15:30.920 --> 15:32.200
Well, they’re different.

15:34.320 --> 15:37.400
-Do you see any clues?
-Seriously?

15:39.680 --> 15:41.760
“Holmes,
what are you doing in the cupboard?”

15:41.840 --> 15:43.760
Do you mean those kinds of clues?

15:44.440 --> 15:47.040
Right now… I’m not joking.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.680
There are clues
that are left after a crime,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.080
traces of what was there before.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.880
-Go on, search.
-All right.

16:13.960 --> 16:14.960
Stand up!

16:18.160 --> 16:20.040
Two beds. One! And two!

16:20.120 --> 16:21.920
The window is in the middle.
Where are the beds?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.200
Near the window. Near the sun!

16:30.840 --> 16:32.040
Lie down. Now lie here.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.200
What do you see?

16:51.240 --> 16:52.240
Good-bye.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.240
Good-bye!

16:56.840 --> 16:58.880
One minute, one minute. Wait.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.760
Okay. So…

17:09.839 --> 17:11.440
The beds are the same.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.520
They just have different covers.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.280
They have different lives.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.040
-Yes.
-That’s a clue. What else?

17:21.359 --> 17:22.359
So…

17:25.079 --> 17:27.960
One… studies hard.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.440
The other doesn’t study at all.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.600
One is tidy.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.520
The other one is a mess.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.080
Everything is great for one…

17:44.520 --> 17:46.480
and terrible for the other.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.040
They’re very different.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.960
-But similar.
-Your conclusions?

17:54.760 --> 17:56.400
The one who went missing…

18:05.440 --> 18:09.200
is the one who didn’t have
a place in the sun.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.840
She didn’t go missing.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.840
She ran away…

18:45.560 --> 18:47.560
and became the cottager’s accomplice.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.920
Hello. Alisa?

18:51.280 --> 18:53.360
-Yes.
-Which bed is yours?

18:54.320 --> 18:56.160
-This one.
-Sit down.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.520
What’s up, Alisa? Did she beat you up?

19:06.560 --> 19:08.880
-No.
-Yes, she beat the hell out of you.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.200
When no one was looking, right?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.960
-What are you silent for!
-Yes!

19:14.040 --> 19:15.840
-Alechka, what happened?
-Quiet!

19:18.920 --> 19:22.120
She wanted to steal your sun.
But who did she steal?

19:22.640 --> 19:24.240
Sasha? Pasha? Vitya?

19:24.800 --> 19:28.960
Oleg! I heard how-- how they were…

19:32.760 --> 19:34.800
<i>She called you, didn’t she?</i>

19:45.240 --> 19:46.840
<i>And you took pills.</i>

20:29.520 --> 20:33.800
It took you 15 years to understand
how the sun moves across the room?

20:34.440 --> 20:36.720
Did you even try to talk to her?

20:58.840 --> 21:01.640
I was wrong. She didn’t run away.
You kicked her out.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.880
-She left on her own!
-In exchange for what?

21:03.960 --> 21:07.000
I send her money every week.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.560
She got money in Lipetsk two times…

21:22.600 --> 21:25.480
and three times at the Vasilkovo station.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.320
Understood.

21:28.400 --> 21:32.080
Well, you know what to do. Do it.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.920
Sofia Zinovevna!

22:09.360 --> 22:10.920
How are you, my dear?

22:12.240 --> 22:14.560
Bertik! Bert!

22:15.240 --> 22:17.000
What are you-- stuck? Come here.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.600
-Bert! Bert!
-Hello.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.720
Bert! I brought you a cake.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.960
Bert died.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.440
He was 15.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.880
For people, that’s a teenager,
but he was an old man.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.880
Yes, I haven’t seen you in a while.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.840
Get acquainted.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.040
Sofia Zinovevna, this is Esenya.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.960
My daughter.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.400
She looks like me, yeah?

22:44.440 --> 22:45.840
She has your forehead.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.800
Pretty name. Were you named after Yesenin?

22:51.760 --> 22:53.520
Of course.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.800
I’ve told you a hundred times
about Sofia Zinovevna.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.680
My favorite teacher.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.000
Yes, yes. Russian and literature.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.400
-Shall we have tea?
-No. Wine.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.680
Red. You like it, right?

23:09.440 --> 23:12.840
It’s embarrassing for a teacher
to admit that, but we aren’t in school.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.680
What, are you still working?

23:14.760 --> 23:17.760
-You’re not tired of it?
-I am, but I’m still working.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.320
Rodik, the school is a circus.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.080
He came once, and it was a circus.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.120
And how are you? Are you writing?

23:27.400 --> 23:28.640
About sports.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.400
No. I’m tired of sports.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.640
Now I’m writing about the stars.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.800
It’s interesting and pays well.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.760
Well, of course.
Journalists have what teachers don’t.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.520
Twenty-five years of the same thing.
Everyday is probably different for you.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.600
Everything is different.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.960
Well…

23:49.400 --> 23:52.040
To teachers! To you,

23:52.600 --> 23:55.680
dear Sofia Zinovevna.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.600
To students. To you.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.000
Young people these days…

24:19.880 --> 24:21.880
I don’t know. No.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.680
We weren’t like that. They’re so…

24:24.760 --> 24:27.200
They’re so… shallow.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.800
-What are you looking for?
-A knife.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.280
I’ll get one.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.760
They aren’t people, but accessories.

24:36.480 --> 24:41.320
And they all have trivial problems.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.720
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.720
For example, my Esenchik.
Sorry I’m talking about you.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.920
Do you know
what she worries about the most?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.520
That her breasts are too small.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.280
“It’s not fashionable,” she says.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.280
You explain to her
what’s fashionable and what’s not.

24:59.880 --> 25:04.280
My dear,
soldiers have always liked big breasts.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.400
Right.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.920
Small breasts inspire poets.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.280
Goethe, François Villon, Blok…

25:11.880 --> 25:13.000
Yesenin.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.760
I can’t say for certain about Pushkin.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.320
As you know, at that time,
breasts were unbound

25:22.400 --> 25:25.240
and… accentuated with a corset,

25:25.320 --> 25:28.880
but Pushkin liked small feet.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.920
I think small breasts…

25:31.720 --> 25:35.800
He probably would have more or less
considered them fitting.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.880
Well, what have I been telling you?

25:39.120 --> 25:42.040
And how are you, my dear? How long
have you been off barbiturates now?

25:50.080 --> 25:51.440
Three years.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.320
As you can see, I haven’t died.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.840
I’m tempted sometimes, but I manage.
Thank you very much.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.040
Rodik, come see me more often. Sometimes.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.640
Come see me too. But it’s not a big deal.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.760
To our kind.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.880
Can we have some tea for the road?

26:28.360 --> 26:30.960
Daughter, go and get them.
In the next room, in the cupboard.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.400
The cups are there. No. She’ll get them.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.080
Go on, hurry.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.680
CLASS 1A OF 2005

27:12.760 --> 27:14.240
What is this…

27:24.320 --> 27:26.040
Have you seen Slavik recently?

27:26.880 --> 27:28.280
It’s been a while.

27:29.680 --> 27:34.360
Winter came.
I gave him a girdle-- for his back pain.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.960
It was made of dog hair.
I haven’t seen him since.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.760
Where are the cups?

27:48.040 --> 27:50.560
All right. We won’t have tea.
There’s no time.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.920
You teachers taught us
and deceived us children.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.600
What did you tell us?
Study hard and everything will be okay.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.240
You’ll be on top, yeah?

28:05.760 --> 28:07.640
Who’s on top now?

28:08.760 --> 28:11.320
Underachievers everywhere.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.080
A society of underachievers.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.080
Were you her student?

28:21.160 --> 28:23.320
We all learn something from each other.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.520
You weren’t in the class photos.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.680
Because she’s my student.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.720
VASILKOVO

29:53.120 --> 29:55.320
What should I do-- go with you, or what?

30:11.840 --> 30:12.920
Pinochet!

30:26.840 --> 30:28.040
Mishanya!

30:29.360 --> 30:31.160
Terrific! Pinochet!

30:31.240 --> 30:33.560
Hello! Hello!

30:34.240 --> 30:36.240
Hi! I didn’t expect…

30:36.320 --> 30:38.680
Meet my wife, Marusya.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.040
Kolya.

30:40.120 --> 30:43.640
Listen, I wasn’t expecting…
How long has it been?

30:46.120 --> 30:49.160
-Fifty years maybe?
-Seven years. All right, 50.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.640
No. Five years.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.520
-It’s been five years.
-I said seven on purpose.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.400
So you’d be even happier.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.000
You bastard!

31:02.800 --> 31:03.920
One minute.

31:05.720 --> 31:09.360
I have my own home brew here.
It’s medicinal, from cranberries.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.120
It’ll add 10 years to your life.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.560
Why do you need more years, Pinochet?

31:19.320 --> 31:20.760
You’ll always be miserable.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.840
-Don’t say it. Help yourself.
-She doesn’t drink.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.000
To our kind?

31:49.520 --> 31:51.120
Well, how’s life?

31:52.440 --> 31:53.760
Difficult.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.120
-It’s wearing me down.
-A lot?

31:57.400 --> 31:59.440
-A lot.
-I’ll teach you what to do.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.680
Remember. Let it go.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.840
Mishanya, if it weren’t for you,
I’d be up to no good here.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.520
All right, let’s not. Go ahead.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.320
He saved me.

32:13.880 --> 32:17.680
Do you know… how he ended up here?

32:17.760 --> 32:19.960
God sent him here. God.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.880
I was taking a walk. It’s pretty here.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.400
Yeah? Pretty?

32:24.360 --> 32:25.440
It’s scary here.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.440
Even dogs don’t come here.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.240
Even the rats ran away.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.320
Why am I here…

32:32.320 --> 32:33.400
keeping watch?

32:44.280 --> 32:47.000
It’s not strong. I spoke too highly of it.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.840
Come with me. I have another one.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.000
One moment.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.360
There. I’m sorry.

33:47.240 --> 33:48.440
I’m sorry.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.360
This is how I live.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.199
What do you have?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.400
Show him.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.440
You’re the closest of all to Slavik.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.239
No, it’s not Slavik.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.480
He has a bad back. Arthritis.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.600
-And when did you see him?
-Last winter.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.800
He bought himself a dacha.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.360
Where?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.880
Somewhere to the south.
Around Tikhvin maybe.

35:05.040 --> 35:06.240
A dacha.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.200
Did he register as a farmer or something?

35:13.320 --> 35:14.520
Slavik…

35:15.960 --> 35:16.960
Yes.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.440
You have an interesting job, Mishan.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.400
-A doctor.
-Yes.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.760
Only it’s not a job. It’s a calling.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.440
As they say, do no harm.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.040
What’s that, gasoline?

35:41.360 --> 35:43.680
-Grain alcohol.
-Let’s have some.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.400
To our kind.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.720
I’ll show you something.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.680
Look what I’ve got here.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.280
It’s on a shaft. Isn’t it cool?

37:31.120 --> 37:32.120
Excellent!

37:34.720 --> 37:36.120
Will you come again?

37:37.240 --> 37:39.280
If only to your funeral!

37:59.720 --> 38:01.120
And then…

38:26.680 --> 38:27.880
Are they there? Let’s go.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.120
Yulia, daughter! Come here.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.000
Go get her.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.720
Okay.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
“Papa.”

39:01.480 --> 39:03.160
Okay, Papa.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.200
Quiet!

39:49.760 --> 39:51.120
Well, go.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.960
-Where?
-There?

39:53.560 --> 39:56.560
-Alone?
-Go and see what they’re doing.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.200
Me?

40:01.480 --> 40:04.040
Two deaf people today are too much for me.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.880
I’m not armed.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.680
I take the method.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.640
Is this a test or something?

40:12.400 --> 40:14.280
It’s a test. Go.

41:10.080 --> 41:10.920
This is Slavik.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.240
I wanted to cut the cake for the girls,
to treat them.

41:21.320 --> 41:23.120
I’ll cut it myself, Slavik. Take a seat.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.800
He didn’t notice. I have arms.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.240
Slavik grew up in our hospital.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.440
His parents abandoned him.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.920
He bounced between orphanages,
and then just wandered.

41:38.520 --> 41:41.880
And when you grew up,
you decided to rescue children, right?

41:42.720 --> 41:47.720
You found them at the train station
and kept them at home, in chains.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.880
For their own good.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.200
One girl cried so much…

41:54.480 --> 41:56.000
you almost strangled her.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.000
Thank God
the neighbors pulled you away in time.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.040
Give me your plate. Give it to me.

42:03.160 --> 42:06.920
So, what, you went to the psych ward.
Seems you would’ve settled down.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.800
Well, see, you were tempted again.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.560
But you took them for their own good.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.000
Right, Slavik?

42:16.080 --> 42:19.280
-They’re miserable. I feel sorry them.
-Of course.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.040
You aren’t a murderer, Slavik?

42:32.640 --> 42:34.080
Drink your tea.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.400
Whoa! Give me that.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.000
A weapon from the stone age?

43:01.400 --> 43:03.400
PARAMEDIC

44:55.720 --> 44:59.320
It’s nice here in Tikhvin. I like it.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.800
-They do too.
-Who?

45:06.880 --> 45:08.280
Let’s go.

45:50.520 --> 45:52.600
-Look what’s happening.
-What are you doing?

45:52.680 --> 45:54.640
Look, look. What’s your name, huh?

45:55.280 --> 45:56.840
-Alyona.
-Alyona?

45:56.920 --> 45:59.320
Is anyone waiting for you at home, Alyon?
No?

45:59.400 --> 46:01.120
-My mama.
-Your mama? That’s it?

46:01.360 --> 46:03.160
-My husband.
-Your husband?

46:03.240 --> 46:06.160
So your husband didn’t meet you, huh?
How dare he!

46:06.240 --> 46:08.520
That’s not right.
He’s an irresponsible husband.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.720
-Well? What?
-Let me go.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.320
-Why?
-Let me go.

46:12.800 --> 46:13.680
Does it hurt?

46:13.760 --> 46:15.600
Go ahead, scream. Scream for help! Scream! Well?

46:17.600 --> 46:18.920
I can’t hear you. Louder.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.560
What was that? Go on, scream!

46:21.840 --> 46:23.960
Here, I’ll help you! Here!

46:25.960 --> 46:27.520
-Let her go!
-Shut up!

46:27.600 --> 46:29.320
You wanted to help her. Help her.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.480
Come on!

46:38.000 --> 46:39.800
Seryozha!

46:41.160 --> 46:42.480
What, are you serious?

46:43.480 --> 46:44.960
Is this your husband or something?

46:50.200 --> 46:52.280
What’s with you, Seryozha?
You’re late, aren’t you?

46:52.360 --> 46:53.760
What’s with you, Seryozha?

46:55.160 --> 46:57.480
You could lose your wife that way,
Seryozha!

46:58.240 --> 47:01.560
And you screamed well.
You need to scream right away!

47:03.400 --> 47:05.840
What are you doing?
What are you doing, you animal!

47:05.920 --> 47:08.000
What, mama, did you wake up?

47:08.760 --> 47:10.160
Seryozha?

47:10.240 --> 47:12.680
Hey! What’s going on?

47:12.760 --> 47:14.280
You underachievers.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.320
What are you-- underachievers?

47:16.400 --> 47:19.160
Why are you moving like turtles?
They’re raping a girl over there.

47:22.920 --> 47:24.640
What are you standing there for? Let’s go!

47:24.720 --> 47:25.920
Run!

47:42.600 --> 47:44.120
What are you, huh?

47:46.920 --> 47:48.360
An underachiever!

47:50.240 --> 47:51.760
An underachiever to everyone!

49:06.160 --> 49:07.920
You thought he wanted to…

49:13.920 --> 49:16.960
Yes. Rape her.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.200
<i>I only realized it then.</i>

50:31.920 --> 50:33.200
What did you realize?

50:34.080 --> 50:37.640
-He wanted to teach them.
-Who? What?

50:56.200 --> 51:00.640
MIKHAILOVSK

51:01.640 --> 51:03.800
-Let’s put paste on Kapustina!
-Let’s do it!

51:03.880 --> 51:06.360
-Put paste on Kapustina?
-Right on the kisser.
