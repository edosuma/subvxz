WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:03.655
You ready to do
our affirmations?

00:03.742 --> 00:04.656
Do we have to?

00:04.743 --> 00:05.830
It's stupid.

00:05.918 --> 00:08.269
Uh-oh, sounds like someone needs

00:08.356 --> 00:11.663
a little gratitude
in their attitude.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.839
Ugh.

00:13.926 --> 00:18.801
MAN [over stereo]:
Joy floods my thoughts
and my life.

00:18.888 --> 00:23.545
BOTH:
Joy floods
my thoughts and my life.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.938
My efforts are being supported
by the universe.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.942
My efforts are being
supported by the universe.

00:30.030 --> 00:30.943
[car sputtering]

00:31.031 --> 00:33.685
Oh, no, no,
no, n-n-no.

00:33.772 --> 00:34.947
No, don't break on me,
I'm begging you.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.733
[groans]

00:37.820 --> 00:39.822
Oh, come on, keep going,

00:39.909 --> 00:41.867
you piece of crap![engine dies]

00:44.435 --> 00:48.135
I respond peacefully
in all situations.

00:48.222 --> 00:51.442
I respond peacefully
in all situations.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.421
[sighs]
So, uh,

01:13.508 --> 01:16.467
I bet you're wondering why
I asked you to come over.

01:16.554 --> 01:19.949
I know what I'm hoping for.

01:20.036 --> 01:20.428
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

01:22.778 --> 01:26.260
I just need some help.

01:26.347 --> 01:27.696
Don't worry, I'm not asking

01:27.783 --> 01:29.045
for the child support
you owe me.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.525
Awesome.

01:30.612 --> 01:34.050
But I really need you
to pay me back

01:34.137 --> 01:36.052
the money I lent you
to buy the van.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.054
Oh, okay.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.926
Well, your timing is good 'cause
I'll have that money very soon.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.929
So never.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.932
I am, as we speak,

01:47.019 --> 01:50.458
in phase two
of a surefire business deal.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.330
Was phase one smoking
pot and watching TV?

01:55.158 --> 01:57.073
You know me so well.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.814
Check this out.

01:58.901 --> 02:02.644
A couple weekends ago, I was
stoned, watching golf on TV,

02:02.731 --> 02:05.081
and I noticed something
very interesting.

02:05.168 --> 02:08.215
Every other commercial
is for boner pills.

02:08.301 --> 02:13.045
It's like they know
old white guys are watching.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.439
Why were you watching golf?

02:15.526 --> 02:18.964
The announcers whisper;
I find it very soothing.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.531
Anyway,

02:20.618 --> 02:23.578
I took the $3,000 I had buried
in your backyard...

02:23.665 --> 02:26.929
There was three grand
buried in the backyard?!

02:27.016 --> 02:30.411
Not the important part
of the story.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.282
Follow me here.

02:32.369 --> 02:35.111
I wired all the money
to a Tijuana pharmacy

02:35.198 --> 02:37.679
and bought
10,000 knock-off Viagras.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.202
I'm driving down there
in the morning,

02:39.289 --> 02:40.682
and on the way back up
I'm gonna stop

02:40.769 --> 02:42.249
at every golf course
I can find

02:42.336 --> 02:44.512
and bone up old white guys
at ten dollars a pop.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.385
Ka-ching.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.173
Quick question.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.261
You don't make a habit
of burying money

02:54.348 --> 02:56.480
in my backyard, do you?

02:58.569 --> 03:00.789
I'm not really sure
that's any of your business.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.408
Mom, what are you doing?

03:11.495 --> 03:14.324
Just trying to get
our car fixed, honey.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.370
Go back to bed.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.419
Thanks for taking me
to the meeting.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.942
Of course.

03:24.029 --> 03:26.206
Just remember,
if I meet a cute guy...

03:26.293 --> 03:29.121
I know, I know,
I have to find my own way home.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.559
Recovering from
the fatal disease of alcoholism

03:31.646 --> 03:35.127
doesn't mean I can't get some
strange every once in a while.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.956
You should sew that
on a pillow.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.916
[chuckles]

03:41.003 --> 03:42.483
Listen, I have
to ask you a question.

03:42.570 --> 03:46.095
Ask away unless it's
about your father.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.314
No, it's not.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.445
I'd know him if I saw him.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.754
Sure.

03:52.841 --> 03:53.929
So, what is it?

03:54.016 --> 03:57.280
Okay, well, I hate to do this,

03:57.367 --> 03:58.412
and I wouldn't if I wasn't
really up against it,

03:58.499 --> 03:59.761
but is there

03:59.848 --> 04:03.155
any way you could lend me
a few grand

04:03.243 --> 04:04.156
until the end
of the month?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.550
[sighing]:
Oh, boy.

04:06.637 --> 04:09.510
It's always so awkward
when relatives ask for money.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.990
Relative?

04:12.077 --> 04:14.341
I'm not some second cousin who
tracked you down on Facebook.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.603
I'm your daughter.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.387
See, it's already uncomfortable.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.260
Come on, you know
I'm good for it.

04:20.346 --> 04:22.043
Do I?
Mom!

04:22.130 --> 04:24.525
I would help you if I could,
but I'm strapped, too.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.657
I'm going paycheck
to paycheck.

04:27.745 --> 04:30.705
Okay, thanks.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.577
[sighs]

04:33.664 --> 04:36.928
You know, I do have an idea that
might buy you a little time.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.669
Great, what is it?

04:38.756 --> 04:40.671
Why don't I move in
with you and the kids

04:40.758 --> 04:42.194
and we'll share expenses?

04:44.240 --> 04:46.808
Oh.

04:46.895 --> 04:50.420
Yeah, that is an idea.

04:50.507 --> 04:51.943
We'd be roomies.

04:52.030 --> 04:52.944
[chuckles]

04:53.031 --> 04:56.339
Yeah, roomies.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.688
So, what do you say?

04:57.775 --> 05:01.083
Ooh, it's a tough one.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.868
I say no and I might be
broke and homeless,

05:03.955 --> 05:07.611
living on the street,
scavenging for food like a dog.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.483
I say yes
and I'm living with you.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.792
So?

05:14.879 --> 05:17.534
I'm thinking.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.192
Then I thought, "Well, that's
crazy, you don't drink anymore."

05:23.279 --> 05:25.542
[sobbing]But I looked up, I was already
in the beverage aisle.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.196
Since I had come all the way
across the store,

05:27.283 --> 05:28.676
it seemed rude
not to buy some...

05:28.763 --> 05:30.330
Looks like she's having
a tough time.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.809
I imagine
that the store clerk might...

05:31.896 --> 05:33.985
She's got Louboutin shoes
and a Prada handbag.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.074
She's doing fine.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.252
Do you want a tissue?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.253
Since I've
been back...

05:41.341 --> 05:42.864
Thank you.

05:42.951 --> 05:45.083
[blows nose loudly]

05:50.088 --> 05:52.003
Be right back.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.092
Oh.

05:55.659 --> 05:56.617
Wait.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.836
What?

05:58.923 --> 06:00.751
Hi.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.232
Um, Christy.

06:04.276 --> 06:05.582
Okay.

06:05.669 --> 06:08.846
Ooh, love the purse.

06:08.933 --> 06:09.499
Thanks.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.327
Wait.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.633
What?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.940
A-Are those
Louboutins?

06:16.027 --> 06:17.159
Yeah.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.074
Eh, gorgeous.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.381
I had a pair once,
but I had to ditch 'em,

06:21.468 --> 06:23.557
running away
from a car fire.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.559
What a night.

06:25.646 --> 06:29.127
Boy, you drunks are
a chatty bunch.

06:29.214 --> 06:31.478
Yeah, well,
that's what we do here--

06:31.565 --> 06:32.957
share war stories.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.917
Sounds great,
but I don't belong here.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.397
I'm not an alcoholic.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.876
That's funny.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.661
That's exactly how I felt
my first meeting.

06:40.748 --> 06:44.578
No, you clearly belong here.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.232
What's going on?

06:47.319 --> 06:50.018
Oh, um, I just thought
that we could invite...

06:50.105 --> 06:50.888
Regina.

06:50.975 --> 06:51.802
...Regina out

06:51.889 --> 06:53.325
for a cup of coffee.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.588
Oh, how nice.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.678
[clenched]:
Why would we do that?

06:57.765 --> 06:59.549
We're supposed to
help each other.

06:59.636 --> 07:03.597
That's just a suggestion,
it's not a rule.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.555
Um, Regina,
this is my mom Bonnie.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.252
Hi.

07:09.037 --> 07:09.864
Why do you want
to buy me coffee?

07:09.951 --> 07:11.561
See, it's not just me.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.218
I just thought you might
need somebody to talk to.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.350
Yeah, well, I don't.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.135
Got it.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.876
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.269
Love, love,
love the shoes.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.662
[clicks tongue]

07:25.749 --> 07:25.836
Hang on.

07:27.838 --> 07:30.711
I guess there's no harm
in a cup of coffee.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.453
Aw, damn it.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.673
You'll have to forgive
my mother,

07:36.760 --> 07:39.546
and if you do,
please tell me how.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.723
[Bonnie laughing]

07:42.810 --> 07:45.595
So there I am,
drunk off my ass,

07:45.682 --> 07:50.687
driving down the 5 freeway
on a stolen lawn mower

07:50.774 --> 07:51.862
in the car pool lane

07:51.949 --> 07:54.604
topless.

07:54.691 --> 07:58.173
Oh, good times.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.261
[sighs]

07:59.348 --> 08:00.654
I got one for you.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.004
I walked into the kitchen
one morning

08:03.091 --> 08:05.789
to make my family
some breakfast, and I realized,

08:05.876 --> 08:07.617
"This isn't my house,
that isn't my family.

08:07.704 --> 08:11.708
And what the hell
am I doing in Vancouver?"

08:11.795 --> 08:14.624
But the reason
I stopped drinking is

08:14.711 --> 08:15.843
because I came
to the horrifying realization

08:15.930 --> 08:17.975
that I was turning
into my mother.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.847
[chuckles]

08:19.934 --> 08:21.631
Hey.

08:21.718 --> 08:22.980
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I hurt your feelings?
Yes.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.983
Well, you ruined my life,
so we're even.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.335
So, Regina,
tell us about you.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.903
Oh, I don't have
any stories like that.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.644
I had a great childhood,

08:34.731 --> 08:35.993
great parents,

08:36.080 --> 08:37.342
did well in school.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.779
Hmm, no wonder
you were having

08:38.866 --> 08:40.868
a nervous breakdown
at an AA meeting.

08:40.955 --> 08:41.650
[chuckles]

08:41.738 --> 08:45.612
I don't like you.

08:45.699 --> 08:49.050
I'm just going
through a tough time right now.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.618
My job is really stressful.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.010
I'm a money manager.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.534
People trust me
with millions

08:54.621 --> 08:56.448
of dollars.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.321
And on top of that, I'm in
the middle of a nasty divorce,

08:59.408 --> 09:03.238
so yeah, maybe I like
to take the edge off

09:03.325 --> 09:06.894
at the end of the day with
a couple of bottles of wine,

09:06.981 --> 09:11.463
a few shots of tequila... and
a fistful of muscle relaxers.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.467
But so what?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.252
Every morning at 6:00 a.m.

09:17.339 --> 09:20.429
I pick myself up
off that floor...

09:20.516 --> 09:23.606
steal some
of my kid's Ritalin...

09:23.693 --> 09:25.782
and start the day anew.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.961
So, if you need
to save somebody,

09:31.048 --> 09:32.659
go save somebody
who needs saving.

09:32.746 --> 09:36.924
[voice breaking]:
Because I don't have a problem.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.056
You heard her; let's go.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.240
This is ridiculous;
I should go home.

09:49.327 --> 09:50.502
Yeah, I don't think
it's a good idea

09:50.590 --> 09:51.852
for you to be alone tonight.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.070
And this'll be fun--
like a slumber party

09:53.157 --> 09:56.683
but, you know,
for broken people.

09:56.770 --> 09:57.509
What about my car?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.120
It'll be okay.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.643
We'll, we'll get it
in the morning.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.253
[sighs]
All right, I guess I'll stay.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.864
Good.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.517
You two have a great time,
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.128
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

10:07.215 --> 10:08.651
Home-- I sleep better
in my own bed.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.306
I know a dozen men
who think otherwise.

10:11.393 --> 10:14.135
Come on, you heard her.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.571
She's not very fond of me.

10:15.658 --> 10:16.528
That's what I
like about her.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.878
Now stay.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.270
So,

10:19.357 --> 10:20.532
where's the guest room?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.578
Right this way.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.233
Welcome.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.582
All right.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.671
Do I have my own bathroom?

10:28.758 --> 10:32.066
Idon't have my own bathroom.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.545
It's over there.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.722
BONNIE:
Hold on.
What?

10:35.809 --> 10:36.897
Show me the bag.

10:36.984 --> 10:37.724
I don't want to.

10:37.811 --> 10:38.681
Give it to me.

10:38.768 --> 10:39.508
Mom, what are you doing?

10:39.595 --> 10:41.858
Helping. Give.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.515
Thank you.

10:47.951 --> 10:50.084
Ooh, ha.

10:50.171 --> 10:53.304
I do a lot of
entertaining.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.178
Mmm.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.833
Sometimes I
entertain musicians.

11:01.704 --> 11:05.490
Those are for injuries
sustained while entertaining.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.710
Can I pee now?!
Maybe.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.233
What do you got going on
with your cleavage?

11:09.320 --> 11:11.061
I'm a full-figured woman.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.455
Yeah, and I want to motorboat
you all night long. Now give.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.157
Ah, cocaine.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.595
I miss the '80s.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.555
Oh, please. You were doing it
three years ago.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.862
We good?You're free to urinate.

11:28.949 --> 11:31.473
Not like there's anything
else I can do in there now.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.088
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

11:38.175 --> 11:39.220
I don't know.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.700
I guess just
throw it away.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.179
Really?

11:42.266 --> 11:44.268
Shouldn't we save it
for when I relapse?

11:44.355 --> 11:45.748
Mom.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.228
Oh, come on. We all
know it's comin'.

11:53.669 --> 11:57.194
What is a "limp bizkit"?

11:57.281 --> 12:00.284
It's a band.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.373
My ex-husband tried to get rich

12:02.460 --> 12:04.201
selling counterfeit
rock and roll T-shirts.

12:04.288 --> 12:07.117
If you like it, I've got
6,000 more in the garage.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.337
This'll do.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.122
Well, um, you know
where the bathroom is,

12:12.209 --> 12:15.430
the kitchen's right there
and if you need anything,

12:15.517 --> 12:17.171
my mom and I are
in that bedroom.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.259
Thank you.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.521
Good night.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.610
Good night.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.399
Regina, I know
this is difficult for you,

12:28.486 --> 12:30.924
but I just want you to know
I think you're doing great.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.056
Really? 'Cause I think
I might snap

12:33.143 --> 12:34.318
and kill you and your mother
in your sleep.

12:37.321 --> 12:40.672
Well, you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.675
I don't have a sense of humor.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.286
Okay.

12:45.373 --> 12:48.855
Sleeping with one eye open.

12:51.683 --> 12:52.380
Night-night.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.164
Night-night.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.214
[door shuts]

13:02.042 --> 13:02.738
That's my side.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.175
I'm a guest.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.307
I don't care. Move over.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.919
How's the train wreck?

13:10.006 --> 13:10.746
[sighs]

13:10.833 --> 13:12.879
I don't know.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.924
The point is, we're doing
a good deed.
Yeah.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.361
Assuming she doesn't melt down
and try to kill us in our sleep.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.278
Why would you say that?

13:21.365 --> 13:22.627
I was kidding.

13:23.672 --> 13:24.934
Okay.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.895
Good night.
[sighs]

13:28.982 --> 13:31.680
Good night.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.074
[sighs]
You know, if we
were roomies,

13:34.161 --> 13:36.728
we could do
this every night.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.036
Uh-huh.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.864
Of course, if I moved in,
I'd want to...

13:41.951 --> 13:44.562
zhush up the place a little.

13:44.649 --> 13:45.563
What's wrong with it?

13:45.650 --> 13:47.391
Eh, it lacks zhush.

13:47.478 --> 13:50.438
It's zhush-less.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.222
Well, I think it's homey.Yeah,

13:52.309 --> 13:54.311
you also think you can catch
a man with sweatpants.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.880
[knocking]Christy?

13:57.967 --> 14:00.100
[groans]

14:00.187 --> 14:01.275
Come on in.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.321
Sorry to bother you.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.063
Oh, no worries.
What's up?

14:07.150 --> 14:08.282
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
until I tell somebody

14:08.369 --> 14:10.850
what's really going on.

14:10.937 --> 14:14.636
Okay.

14:14.723 --> 14:15.680
[quietly]:
I saw a lezbo porn movie

14:15.767 --> 14:18.248
start just like this.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.212
I kind of got bigger problems
than I let on.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.910
Financial problems.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.564
Oh, no shame in that.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.697
My car just broke down,
I can't afford to fix it

14:32.784 --> 14:35.439
and I have credit card debt
like you wouldn't believe.

14:35.526 --> 14:36.832
Really? How much?

14:36.919 --> 14:38.921
Nineteen...

14:39.008 --> 14:40.357
thousand... dollars.

14:40.444 --> 14:43.534
[chuckles]
You are so cute.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.755
Try $3.5 million.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.061
What?
What?

14:48.148 --> 14:49.410
You know how I told you

14:49.497 --> 14:50.672
people trust me
with their money?

14:50.759 --> 14:51.673
Yeah.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.283
They shouldn't.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.505
I embezzled from my clients.

14:57.592 --> 14:58.898
Why?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.508
What kind of
question is that?

15:00.595 --> 15:03.467
What's the better question?How?

15:03.554 --> 15:07.254
You got to be good at math
and have a face people trust.

15:07.341 --> 15:10.213
And the dream dies.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.476
Anyway...

15:12.563 --> 15:15.697
the real reason
I came here tonight was...

15:15.784 --> 15:18.961
I think the police might be
waiting for me at my house.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.226
It's all gonna be okay.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.488
How can you say that?

15:24.575 --> 15:26.664
Oh, not for you. I was...

15:26.751 --> 15:29.798
kind of saying it to myself.

15:29.885 --> 15:30.930
What?

15:31.017 --> 15:31.931
I thought I was in trouble,

15:32.018 --> 15:33.323
but, listening to you,

15:33.410 --> 15:35.151
I realized I have
great problems.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.457
I love them! I love my problems!

15:36.544 --> 15:38.894
You done?

15:38.981 --> 15:41.070
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Tonight's about you.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.506
I just got excited. Go on.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.683
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.948
Well, whatever it is,

15:49.035 --> 15:51.037
you don't have
to go through it alone.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.518
Thank you.

15:56.303 --> 15:57.347
Regina, wait.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.307
Come on.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.526
Snuggle in.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.921
Maybe I will.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.967

Mom, why is the couch all ma...

16:32.469 --> 16:34.428
[door shuts]

16:38.214 --> 16:39.433
Mom.
What?

16:39.520 --> 16:40.390
Regina's gone.

16:40.477 --> 16:43.698
Okay.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.787
Wake up.
What?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.137
We got to go find her.Oh, for God's sake.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.704
Haven't we helped enough?[groans]

16:49.791 --> 16:52.402
She doesn't have her car.
We can still catch her.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.187
All right.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.537
Hey, you suppose there's
a reward for her capture?

16:56.624 --> 16:58.539
You'd really turn her in?Oh, honey,

16:58.626 --> 17:02.804
if there was a big enough
reward, I'd turn you in.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.113
Do you think that's her?

17:10.116 --> 17:12.509
Do I think that's her?

17:17.601 --> 17:18.428
Hey.

17:18.515 --> 17:21.431
Hey, Christy.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.738
Where you headed?

17:23.825 --> 17:24.913
Canada.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.351
Gonna build a whole
new life there.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.485
You know, you can be
extradited from Canada.

17:31.572 --> 17:32.703
Are you sure?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.792
Oh, I'm positive.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.578
Okay, then.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.279
Mexico.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.248
I'll tell you what, if I
stole that kind of money,

17:55.335 --> 17:56.684
I'd make damn sure
I had a getaway plan

17:56.771 --> 18:00.079
that didn't involve a tricycle.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.385
You're right. I should've
just whipped out my boobs

18:02.472 --> 18:04.431
and grabbed a lawn mower.

18:07.564 --> 18:12.003
Calm down, ladies,
you're both gangsters.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.052
Hey, the sun's coming out.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.098
Thank you, Annie.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.584
How about that.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.934
First time I've gone
the whole night without a drink

18:30.021 --> 18:33.112
in, like, 16, 17 years.

18:34.287 --> 18:37.377
Oh, damn, I am an alcoholic.

18:37.464 --> 18:40.597
Cheer up. There's lots
of meetings in prison.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.122
I really don't like you.

18:43.209 --> 18:47.300
That's okay. I like myself
enough for the both of us.

18:49.780 --> 18:50.520
You need some money, Christy?

18:50.607 --> 18:52.522
Yeah, why?

18:52.609 --> 18:54.133
I still have some stashed away,

18:54.220 --> 18:55.046
and the Feds
are just gonna take it.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.310
Let me help you out.

18:57.397 --> 18:57.658
Really?

18:58.702 --> 19:01.879
Wow...

19:01.966 --> 19:04.447
Do it.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.888
Gee, I-I don't know.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.934
Take it.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.940
No, Regina,
I don't want your money.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.029
Damn it.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.251
It's technically not my money.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.556
Even still. It's just...

19:26.643 --> 19:28.515
It's not what this is about.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.995
[sighs]

19:31.082 --> 19:32.823
You're a good woman, Christy.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.956
Thank you.

19:35.043 --> 19:35.783
And Bonnie?

19:37.872 --> 19:39.395
Yeah?

19:39.482 --> 19:41.354
I think you know where we stand.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.008
I do.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.794
When you go to prison,
can I have your purse?

19:55.498 --> 20:00.242
[sighs]
Bill, bill, bill.

20:00.329 --> 20:04.681
Oh, crap, I'm gonna have to live
with my mother.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.770
Hey, got a minute?

20:06.857 --> 20:08.772
Sure, come on in.

20:08.859 --> 20:11.819
Lot of holes
in the backyard.

20:11.906 --> 20:15.736
Yep, I was trying
to rob your bank.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.172
No need.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.434
Thank you,

20:18.521 --> 20:21.785
Mexican Viagra.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.439
What?

20:23.526 --> 20:27.008
I sold all of it
before I got out of San Diego.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.402
This is unbelievable!

20:29.489 --> 20:30.707
And that's just your share.

20:30.794 --> 20:31.882
There's more?!No.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.364
You know what? Uh...

20:35.451 --> 20:37.584
I don't care.
[exhales]

20:37.671 --> 20:40.195
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

20:40.282 --> 20:43.329
I took one before I came over

20:43.416 --> 20:45.940
just in case you want
to really thank me.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.334
Sure! What the hell.
