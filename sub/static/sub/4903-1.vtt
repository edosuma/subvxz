WEBVTT

00:10.677 --> 00:13.637
- Hey, growl, will you, lion?
- Come on. Make some noise, you knob.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.265
- Yeah, we got to start the movie.
- You need to keep growling.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.641
I think he's bummed out.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.935
- Stick a pin in his bum, eh?
- No way.

00:20.103 --> 00:23.731
- What are you on, Valium?
- Maybe I ought to crank his tail?

00:23.898 --> 00:25.315
- Great.
- That'd start him up.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.525
Start up. Come on, eh? Start up.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.861
Maybe we ought to call Marlin Perkins, eh?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.947
Get Wild Kingdom here, eh?
Come on. He's getting mad.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.241
- Yeah.
- Oh, jeez. We better get going.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.829
Okay, do the theme, eh?

00:41.291 --> 00:44.877
- Good day. Oh, do our new movie theme, eh?
- Yeah, okay.

00:48.631 --> 00:49.631
Beauty, eh?

00:49.799 --> 00:52.801
Okay. Good day. I'm Bob McKenzie.
This is my brother Doug.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.971
- How's it going, eh?
- Welcome to our movie, eh? Okay.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.182
- Our topic is movies.
- Yeah.

00:58.349 --> 01:02.644
Okay, first off,
the difference between movies and TV, eh?

01:02.812 --> 01:04.480
Okay. Go to TV.

01:04.855 --> 01:06.982
This is the difference
between TV and movies, eh?

01:07.150 --> 01:09.526
- So?
- Okay, go back to movies.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.071
- Now that hoser's growling.
- Yeah.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.572
Take off, will you? We're doing our movie.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.657
Don't wreck our show, you hoser.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.827
- Okay, another topic. Zoom out, eh?
- Yeah.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.705
We'll show them how big the screen is, eh?
Zoom out. Go.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.665
- Look how huge it is, eh?
- Okay.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.918
Like, normally, we just have
"Great White North," eh?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.504
But look, we got--
What's that over there?

01:28.671 --> 01:32.257
Okay, like,
England and Ireland and France, eh?

01:32.509 --> 01:35.969
He's a genius, eh? He knows the atlas.
Okay, and over here we have--

01:36.846 --> 01:41.141
- Uh, Russia and Hawaii.
- Okay. All hosers in Russia and Hawaii...

01:41.309 --> 01:45.020
- ...and England, welcome to our movie.
- How's it going, comrades?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.689
We made-- Zoom back in, eh?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.610
Okay, so we made a movie, eh?
So we're going to show that now.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.028
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.698
Wait. First they got to--
You got to interview me, the director.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.159
- I've got to put up the screen, too, eh?
- Don't forget.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.037
Okay, zoom in on me, the director.
Come on.

02:03.706 --> 02:04.873
I directed, too, eh?

02:05.041 --> 02:08.710
Yeah, well, I have to give them
my theory on movies, eh?

02:09.086 --> 02:13.006
Okay. Here's my theory on movies.
You want to know how to wreck a movie, eh?

02:13.174 --> 02:16.260
Take a jar of moths into the theater, eh,
and, like--

02:16.427 --> 02:17.427
Sorry.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.931
And then, like,
release them at a point in the movie

02:21.099 --> 02:22.683
when you know what happens, eh?

02:22.851 --> 02:26.603
And all the moths will fly up to the
projection booth window, cloud it up...

02:26.771 --> 02:28.397
...and you can demand your money back.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.065
- Okay, zoom out, eh?
- Beauty idea.

02:30.233 --> 02:34.027
This movie was shot in 3-B,
three beers, and it looks good, eh?

02:34.195 --> 02:36.029
- Get it?
- Hoserama. Call it Hoserama.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.406
Okay, so we made a movie.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.994
So sit back, get some corn,
and let's have-- It's movie time.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.203
- Okay, turn it on.
- Okay.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.626
Give them enough time
just to see, okay.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.421
Okay, then,
"10 years after World War Four."

02:52.589 --> 02:55.048
- "2051." No. More.
- What? No.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.593
- 2051, the future.
- They saw it already.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.136
- Take off.
- The next century.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.556
I was the only one left on the planet
after the holocaust, eh?

03:02.891 --> 03:03.891
Hey, Hoser, go.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.186
The Earth had been, like, devastated
by nuclear war.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.981
Like, Russia blew up the U.S.,
and the U.S. blew up Russia, eh?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.901
- The Statue of Liberty.
- Psst, act!

03:14.068 --> 03:18.405
Lucky for me, I'd been off planet
on vacation at the time of the war, eh?

03:19.616 --> 03:23.368
There wasn't much to do.
All the bowling alleys had been wrecked.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.997
So I spent most of my time
looking for beer.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.459
One day, I was out
looking for a nice place

03:30.627 --> 03:32.586
to build a city for my children,

03:32.754 --> 03:35.631
when I spotted a mutant
in the forbidden zone.

03:36.591 --> 03:40.302
I landed my vehicle to pursue
and destroy this genetic freak

03:40.470 --> 03:43.847
before he could warn other mutants
in the underground caves.

03:44.432 --> 03:48.143
I was kind of like a one-man force, eh?
Like Charlton Heston in Omega Man.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.103
Did you see it? It was a beauty.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.651
Fleshy-headed mutant, are you friendly?

03:55.818 --> 03:56.944
No way, eh?

03:57.111 --> 04:00.447
Radiation has made me
an enemy of civilization.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.700
Alpha Base, this is Bob McKenzie.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.745
I've spotted a fleshy-headed mutant
in Sector 16B.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.331
Ow! Take off, you hoser.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.001
Dude, what happened? Film broke.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.420
Got to fix it, eh? Sorry, film--

04:15.588 --> 04:17.130
- Sorry.
- I can't see, eh?

04:17.298 --> 04:19.507
- Turn the lights on.
- It was his fault. He wrecked it.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.927
- It was not. We had a lot of popcorn, too.
- Oh.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.222
Okay, you cover, I'll fix the film, eh?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.849
Oh, I'm getting whiplash
from my burps, eh?

04:28.017 --> 04:29.059
Okay.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.604
Aw, nice going, you knob.

04:32.772 --> 04:38.151
- Hey! What kind of movie is this?
- Okay. Here's how to get--

04:38.528 --> 04:39.736
Zoom in on me.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.532
Zoom in on this.
Okay, here's how to get free beer, eh?

04:43.741 --> 04:44.866
Get a baby mouse,

04:45.034 --> 04:46.660
and, like, put it in a bottle...

04:46.828 --> 04:50.330
...and when it's so small,
it'll fit in, like, this hole, eh?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.498
And then--

04:51.666 --> 04:54.459
Hey! They did this on their album.
Rip-off.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.628
- Will you shut up?
- Ah, you shut up.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.215
- Maybe with some spit--
- We won't be able to fix the film, eh?

05:00.383 --> 05:03.051
Here's what happened in the film, eh?
After I was chased-- Take off.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.679
After I chased the van, eh,
he took me back to his--

05:05.847 --> 05:08.348
Don't tell them the film, eh?
You're supposed to show it.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.434
But we can't show it, eh,
'cause it's wrecked.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.227
Just show it like this, eh?
Just hold it up.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.688
Zoom in on this, eh? Zoom in.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.732
- Oh, jeez, that's a good idea, eh?
- Yeah.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.526
That's it. We're leaving, kids. Come on.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.069
- Okay.
- Hey, sit down.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.988
- We're getting out of here.
- No way.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.073
- Oh, come on.
- How come everybody's going, eh?

05:25.241 --> 05:26.616
I don't know. It gets better, eh?

05:26.784 --> 05:28.035
What a waste of money.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.120
Where's the manager?
Get me the manager.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.913
I hope you're proud of yourselves.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.583
- Take off, eh?
- How come everybody's so ticked, eh?

05:34.751 --> 05:38.086
I don't know, eh, but we may as well
really wreck this movie now.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.588
- Your moths?
- Yeah.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.465
Here we go, eh?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.717
Oh, boy.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.481
You take the beer and--

05:59.067 --> 06:00.275
A six-pack.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.113
Oh, my God! Why don't you fry--

06:09.494 --> 06:12.371
Well, then how about
a couple of passes to a real movie?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.289
Can you believe this?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.458
- Let's get out of here, okay?
- Yeah.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.834
You hoser.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.253
Not that way. We'll get killed. This way.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.471
They've been saving their allowance
for weeks to see this movie.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.809
What am I supposed to tell them?
What the heck am I supposed to tell them?

06:33.976 --> 06:35.977
We're real sorry.
Here's some money back, eh?

06:36.145 --> 06:37.854
It's only $15. Take it. It's yours.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.773
Take off. That's Dad's beer money, eh?

06:39.982 --> 06:42.442
Hey, look!
They're giving refunds in the alley.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.069
Get 'em!

07:01.504 --> 07:03.672
- Uh-oh. Watch out. Cops!
- What?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.674
- Cops!
- This is the police.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.426
I'll come back for you.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.469
Good thing
I'm still wearing that jock, eh?

07:11.472 --> 07:13.181
- Wait up, eh?
- You hurry, you hoser.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.184
That's them. Get them!

07:18.855 --> 07:20.272
- Who's driving?
- You drive.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.606
There's a lot of cops around.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.275
Okay. Thanks.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.489
- It's $20.
- Beauty.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.617
- Why are you going this way?
- There's a shortcut.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.495
Roadblock. Go that way.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.831
- I told him to go the other way.
- I'm sorry.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.249
Let's move it.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.502
We know. We're moving.
My brother's drunk.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.379
- I am not, eh?
- Yeah, you are, too.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.923
Come on. Let's go.

09:38.452 --> 09:39.953
First come, first served.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.956
Come on. Give me one.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.416
- No way.
- Give me one.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.876
Take one, then that's it for you.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.175
Give me the church key. Beauty.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.930
Here. Come on.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.360
Here, boy.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.656
Save one of those beers for me, eh?

10:34.884 --> 10:36.801
He's guarding the beer.
What are we gonna do?

10:36.969 --> 10:38.720
- Bribe him.
- Give him a doughnut.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.929
He likes jelly.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.057
- Jelly doughnut coming.
- Okay, Hosehead.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.309
- You'll like this.
- It's a jelly doughnut.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.853
- Get it over there.
- Okay. Beauty.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.064
Quick, get a glass. Beauty.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.399
What the hell's going on in there?

10:51.567 --> 10:52.692
Just getting your beer.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.285
- You take it to him.
- No way.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.079
- You take it to him.
- No, you.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.330
No.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.582
- You take it.
- I'm letting go.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.042
I'm letting go of the beer.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.210
- You're taking it.
- No.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.461
- I'm letting go.
- I'm letting go.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.754
- Let it go.
- Okay, fine.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.130
Now what?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.883
- Dad, Bob broke your beer.
- No, I didn't. Doug broke it.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.927
- It was you.
- Clean up the mess, boys.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.471
I want you hosers to get me
a fresh case of beer

11:21.639 --> 11:23.056
first thing in the morning.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.058
We're going to need some money.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.228
Use the money
I gave you today, you idiot.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.981
Way to go.
You gave away the money.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.235
What's going to happen
if this plan don't work, eh?

11:35.403 --> 11:38.196
The old man'll boot us out,
and we'll have no place to sleep.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.657
I could live in the van, eh?
I don't need a place to sleep.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.784
You need money to live
or you'll starve.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.577
This plan sucks. I ain't going in.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.247
You are, too, or I'll tell
the old man you gave away his money.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.291
Okay. You boss me around.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.794
- 'Morning, George.
- How are you, Paddy?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.796
Give me 12 fresh
Yukon Gold, please.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.465
$7.90, please.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.761
That horse ran like a bum yesterday.
See you tomorrow.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.555
Okay, take it easy.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.016
Well?

12:07.184 --> 12:08.768
- Elsinore.
- Twelve.

12:08.936 --> 12:09.978
- Twenty-four.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.521
Twenty-four Elsinore beers.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.939
- Twenty-four.
- Yeah.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.692
$14.70.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.990
I believe there'll be no charge
on this two-four of beer, thank you.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.575
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.327
We found this mouse
in a bottle of Elsinore beer...

12:26.495 --> 12:28.371
...that we bought at your beer store, eh?

12:28.539 --> 12:32.000
And we heard, like, when that happens
that you get your beer free.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.002
It's in the
Canadian Criminal Code, eh?

12:34.170 --> 12:36.921
Like there's legal precedent set
in cases in law.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.843
- So, like, give us our free beer.
- You want free beer? Go to the brewery.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.387
Now get out of here
before I put the two of you in a bottle.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.890
Are you sure
you don't want to think this over?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.433
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.601
- We're going.
- Yeah.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.769
See you.

13:16.587 --> 13:21.216
Jeez, there's a lot of arrows, eh?
"Elsinore Castle. Elsinore Brewery.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.093
"Royal Canadian Institute
for the Mentally Insane."

13:24.303 --> 13:27.305
- Hey, that's the loony bin, eh?
- Yeah, it sure looks spooky up there.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.932
I don't like it at all.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.351
Where should we go? Loony bin or brewery?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.228
I'm taking you to the loony bin.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.896
I'm going to the brewery.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.815
- No way. Go to the brewery.
- All right.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.691
Then I'm taking you to the loony bin.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.329
Holy jeez! Look at that.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.082
Help!

13:56.710 --> 13:57.710
Holy jeez!

13:59.255 --> 14:01.089
Jeez! What should we do, eh?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.424
- Get me out of here.
- Hold it, hold it.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.592
Her tires are insulators.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.220
Don't get out of the car
or you'll get electrocuted.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.598
- He hooked up our stereo, eh?
- I can't get out. The doors are stuck.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.392
- You know what we got to do, eh?
- What?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.519
- Ram her from behind. Come on.
- What?

14:15.354 --> 14:16.855
- Who's driving?
- You are.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.356
In case she sues for whiplash,

14:18.524 --> 14:20.733
I don't know you.
I'm just a hitchhiker, eh?

14:22.111 --> 14:24.487
- You won't sue for whiplash?
- Hurry.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.299
- Hey, thanks a lot.
- Okay.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.261
- See her looking at me?
- She thought you were some kind of freak.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.846
- Let's go.
- Take off. She likes me, eh?

14:50.055 --> 14:51.055
No way.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.398
What happened?

15:00.566 --> 15:01.774
There's a power surge
at the main gate.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.818
We lost picture, but we have it back.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.028
Is she here?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.655
Yes. She's not alone.
She's got two guys with her.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.032
Lawyers.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.618
I knew this would happen.
Don't let them in.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.328
They're already in.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.663
Damn distortion. What is it? That's twice.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.874
- Where is he?
- Oh, he's back in the thing.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.762
- Yes?
- She's here.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.517
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I--

15:36.685 --> 15:40.188
Ted just said she had lawyers with her.
I thought we should discuss it.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.858
I did not say they were lawyers.
You said they were lawyers.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.069
They don't look like lawyers to me.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.366
- You have the check?
- Yes, it's right here.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.203
- Did her mother sign it?
- Yes, she did.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.122
- And you know what to do?
- Yes, yes, I know.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.838
- It's real big, eh?
- Yeah.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.215
Now don't get scared.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.468
Just think of all the free beers
we're going to get. Come on.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.733
- Good morning. May I help you?
- Yeah.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.277
We have an appointment
with that guy there, eh?

16:29.488 --> 16:34.242
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Elsinore passed away recently.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.369
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.079
Yes, well,

16:38.247 --> 16:41.833
we made the appointment
with the deceased quite some time ago, eh?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.167
We were away on business.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.837
- How long ago was it?
- When did he die?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.755
- I beg your pardon?
- Wait.

16:47.923 --> 16:51.050
Okay. You know his replacement, eh,
like, the new boss?

16:51.385 --> 16:54.262
We made the appointment with him, eh?
What's his name again?

16:54.430 --> 16:57.098
I'm afraid that's
private company business.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.559
I see. Well,

17:00.936 --> 17:05.356
perhaps one of these
would refresh your memory, eh?

17:09.486 --> 17:12.530
Well, the day after he died

17:12.698 --> 17:17.117
his brother Claude married his wife
and took over the entire brewery.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.954
But there is a daughter.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.249
- Go, eh?
- It's my last one.

17:23.416 --> 17:24.666
Go.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.295
It's a jelly.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.969
She just turned 21
and legally inherits the whole brewery.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.971
So she's the new boss?

17:37.556 --> 17:42.060
However, today I've asked Pamela
to drop by so that we could present her

17:42.227 --> 17:47.023
with this honorarium and
the temporary share transfer agreement.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.651
In other words, you're buying her out.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.863
Nobody's buying anybody out, Henry.

17:54.656 --> 17:58.493
This is a temporary arrangement,
to relieve her of the burden of ownership

17:58.660 --> 18:00.703
so she can continue with her studies.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.748
Do you want to be relieved
of the burden of ownership?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.500
Well, I don't know.

18:06.001 --> 18:09.170
$5 million is an awful lot of money.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.674
My mother might have accepted
your proposals, but I don't.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.761
Forget it, Uncle.
I'm taking over the company.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.598
There's a legal question to consider here.
Excuse me.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.393
Essentially, this is a vote of trust.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.021
- Come on. We're lost.
- Shh.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.440
- We're lost.
- It's a big brewery.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.194
- Keep quiet.
- Give me my hat.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.488
You're not going to get it back.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.615
Keep quiet.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.410
Who are you?

18:42.121 --> 18:46.541
Yes, we have an appointment
with the president, the new president,

18:46.708 --> 18:48.876
not the one who died, eh, of the brewery.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.046
Mr. Claude Elsinore.
Perhaps you've heard of him?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.008
Come on. I'll show you.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.719
Do you know who that is?

18:58.887 --> 18:59.887
- Who?
- It's Jean LaRose.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.223
Montreal Canadien Rookie of the Year
two years ago.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.225
- He doesn't play hockey no more.
- He's a cop.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.352
He knows you're lying about the mouse.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.104
He'll arrest you. I'll be a witness.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.606
I got that guy's hockey card at home.
I'll show it to you.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.072
Looks like LaRose picked up
those two hicks.

19:19.950 --> 19:23.744
But you don't know how to run a brewery.
Who'll handle the day-to-day operations?

19:23.912 --> 19:26.330
Henry ran it for my father.
He can run it for me.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.416
I'll help all I can. Excuse me.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.002
I just don't want to step on Smith's toes.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.211
Who?

19:32.379 --> 19:33.421
What? We're having a meeting.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.716
These gentlemen here say
they have a meeting with you, eh?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.259
When? What meeting?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.970
- Hey, whiplash. How's it going?
- Just fine, thanks.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.639
- What's the reason for this?
- Are you Claude Elsinore?

19:43.807 --> 19:45.057
Yes.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.227
Well, we found this mouse
in a bottle of your beer, eh?

19:48.395 --> 19:52.857
We were at a party, and a friend of ours,
a cop, had some and he puked.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.612
And he said, come here and get free beer
or he'll press charges.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.698
Henry, could this have happened?

20:01.116 --> 20:04.368
Well, not so long ago when there were men
on the bottling lines,

20:04.536 --> 20:06.913
this sort of thing didn't happen.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.708
So let's get some men
on the bottling line.

20:13.045 --> 20:17.715
Welcome to 1984,
the age of automation and unemployment.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.469
The rise of the machine
and the fall of man.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.805
The end of the human era.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.350
You don't know what I'm talking about.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.436
What? We can't hear you.
We got these things in our ears, eh?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.356
Big Brother is watching you.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.317
Here, put these on. Safety requirements.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.237
Your job is to watch
the bottles on this line.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.280
Watch them for mice.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.492
- What's my job?
- Help him.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.884
- You got an opener?
- Yeah. I stole this.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.137
- It's open.
- Two at a time.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.430
- Beauty.
- Cheers.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.349
- To our new jobs.
- Yeah, beauty.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.109
Let me see what you've got.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.694
Okay.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.322
Good. Now, bring the lunatics
from the institute.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.325
I want to see how the drug
in the beer is affecting them.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.911
They're responding to the sounds.
Watch this.

22:07.909 --> 22:11.078
Okay, basically it's the same system
with a new addition.

22:11.621 --> 22:12.997
Specific tones...

22:14.082 --> 22:16.959
...are still linked to motivation,
but now we've added color distinction.

22:17.127 --> 22:21.088
So, object A will attack object B,
or black will attack white, or vice versa.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.923
I'll try the whole thing out tomorrow.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.343
- Same concentration of formula?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.220
That means we are right on schedule.

22:29.639 --> 22:33.851
Just one more test,
and then we are ready for the world.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.063
Light them up.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.780
Thank you.

22:53.830 --> 22:58.000
You know, Pamela, I don't want you
to think that your mother and I

22:58.168 --> 23:02.254
don't understand how you feel
about losing your father.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.216
If it had been me who died,
you'd be over it by now.

23:05.467 --> 23:09.804
It's easy to wallow in self-pity.
The hard thing is to go on living.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.639
We'll always have our memories.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.934
The Colonel's dead.
Here we are still enjoying his chicken.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.647
Don't you think it's a little unusual
to get married so soon after the funeral?

23:24.653 --> 23:26.237
More bean medley, dear?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.660
Where did you boys get all this beer?

23:32.828 --> 23:34.036
You stole it, didn't you?

23:34.204 --> 23:36.872
- I'm calling the police.
- No way. We got jobs.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.375
This was free beer, Dad.
There's more outside.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.502
- How much more?
- Oh, about 10 or 12 cases.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.380
We got jobs at Elsinore Brewery.
We work there now, eh?

23:44.756 --> 23:47.133
Do you hear that, honey? They got jobs.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.884
They got free beer.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.306
We're in his good books now, eh?

23:54.474 --> 23:55.516
Yeah, well, let's not blow it

23:55.684 --> 23:58.394
by sleeping in and being late
for our first day at work, eh?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.856
- Why don't we stay up all night?
- Beauty idea.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.359
Honey, phone the neighbors.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.320
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.364
Hey, George, the boys got jobs.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.408
- Are you crazy?
- Shut up.

24:12.576 --> 24:17.496
- What's going on out there?
- Damn it, McKenzie, shut up.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.544
Good morning, Elsinore Brewery.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.672
I'm sorry, he doesn't work here anymore.
Thank you.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.426
They were here when I got here.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.429
- Guys.
- Shut up, Ma.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.722
Oh, jeez.

24:37.684 --> 24:40.936
Good day. We got here too early, eh?
We were just waiting.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.981
Where's Henry Green?
Weren't you supposed to meet him here?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.774
Jeez, I just got up, eh? I don't know.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.736
Okay. Come along now.
You can't leave this mess here,

24:48.904 --> 24:51.238
so I'll show you the way to the cafeteria

24:51.406 --> 24:53.908
and then we'll try
and find Henry Green, okay?

24:54.242 --> 24:56.869
- Get up. Jeez, you hoser.
- Take off.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.783
Well, if there's no staff,
there's no reason to have a cafeteria.

25:35.951 --> 25:39.161
Jeez, I told you we brought too many
doughnuts, eh? This is spooky in here.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.539
- It's like a ghost town, isn't it?
- Yeah.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.500
- You hoser.
- Take off.

25:45.877 --> 25:46.877
Look out, eh?

25:48.588 --> 25:50.130
And the lights don't work.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.676
Hey, check this out. There's sandwiches
and smokes in these machines, eh?

25:53.843 --> 25:56.011
Here's an old Galactic Border Patrol game.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.390
Jeez, you got Joe Louis,
and, jeez, is that tuna or what?

25:59.558 --> 26:00.724
Plugs don't work.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.143
Hey, give me some quarters.
I'm gonna have chocolate milk.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.522
- Forget it, hoser, the power's turned off.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.649
There's a door here. It's locked.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.943
Do you have a credit card?

26:11.111 --> 26:13.320
- Yeah, but I--
- She's got a credit card.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.698
- Give it to me. I need it.
- He needs the credit card, eh?

26:15.865 --> 26:18.033
- Okay, here.
- Okay, coming, credit card.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.787
- Jeez, travel, eh? Here you go.
- Beauty.

26:21.955 --> 26:25.291
He once got our dead battery going
by mixing birds' feces

26:25.458 --> 26:28.085
and spit, 'cause there's acid in it, eh?

26:29.087 --> 26:30.838
So, do you travel quite a bit?

26:32.924 --> 26:33.924
Beauty.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.218
Bingo. Lunch break.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.512
Holy jeez. Jackpot.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.515
How did you do that?

26:41.683 --> 26:44.727
Oh, I know some stuff
about electricity, eh?

26:45.020 --> 26:47.021
Hey, here's a chocolate.

26:49.524 --> 26:50.524
Cheers.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.695
Hoser, this is four months old.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.533
What is it?

27:03.580 --> 27:05.080
The power's on in the old cafeteria.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.919
- Our nosey little friends?
- It must be them.

27:12.547 --> 27:15.424
I think it's time
the little lady and I had a chat.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.180
Sorry I ralphed, Pam.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.265
You shouldn't have had
that chocolate milk.

27:23.433 --> 27:28.354
I know. Sorry about your sweater.
You can take it out of my pay if you want.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.565
- That's okay.
- Jeez, you're real nice.

27:32.442 --> 27:35.277
If I didn't have puke breath,
I'd kiss you.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.737
Hey, Pam.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.656
- Your name's on this machine.
- What?

27:38.823 --> 27:42.117
You got to level six,
I only got to level five. Beauty playing.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.788
- I never played that game before.
- Well, your name's right here.

27:46.539 --> 27:50.918
- Not a bad score either.
21-10-59.

27:51.294 --> 27:55.381
- That's right.
- That's my birth date. October 21, 1959.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.008
My name is gone.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.260
- Who's John Elsinore?
- My father.

28:00.428 --> 28:03.055
Fresh as a daisy. Hey, can I play?

28:03.223 --> 28:05.140
Sure, go ahead. Ow! This thing's hot.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.936
Jeez, you better check this thing.
Look, the plug's glowing.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.898
- Miss Elsinore?
- Hey, Rosie.

28:13.608 --> 28:16.276
- Mr. Smith is waiting for you.
- Where is he?

28:16.444 --> 28:19.405
In the brewery room.
I can show you the way.

28:19.572 --> 28:22.199
No, thanks. It's okay.
I can find my way myself.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.868
- Okay, see you guys later.
- Hey, thanks for the jobs, eh?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.453
Yeah, we'll work real hard.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.707
Hey, Rosie, will you sign a hockey card?
I brought it from home.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.084
- Where'd you get that?
- I collect them.

28:32.252 --> 28:35.295
But I already had the gum, eh?
Sign it, "To Bob McKenzie, my good pal."

28:35.463 --> 28:38.507
Put "Rosie the Rose."
I know you like being called Rosie, eh?

28:38.675 --> 28:41.969
- How did Pam's dad die?
- He was electrocuted.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.096
Take off. He's signing my card.

28:44.264 --> 28:47.224
Hey, that was a great hat trick
you got against Czechoslovakia, eh?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.643
Sorry about that nervous breakdown
you had.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.854
I guess it kind of screwed up your career.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.940
You had a nervous breakdown, eh?
Me, too, when he was born.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.485
- Take off, you hoser.
- You take off, you knob.

28:59.988 --> 29:00.988
Okay.

29:02.657 --> 29:05.701
Good morning, Miss Elsinore.
I'm Brewmeister Smith.

29:06.661 --> 29:09.329
My condolences to you
on the loss of your father.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.248
I appreciate your sympathy,

29:11.458 --> 29:14.501
but I came here
to talk about my plans for the brewery.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.604
It's really your brewery now, isn't it?

29:33.772 --> 29:36.940
Oh, well, I'm very flattered
that you think I'm that important.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.861
But of course it's not true.
I'm just an employee.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.070
Really?

29:42.363 --> 29:45.240
Well, who employed you
to install surveillance cameras?

29:47.285 --> 29:50.829
You see, the brewery business
has become very competitive these days.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.081
So security is extremely important.

29:53.249 --> 29:57.044
What made this brewery great is that
my father ran it as a family business.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.589
I'm afraid you have two weeks notice,
Mr. Smith.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.634
You must be out of your mind, young lady.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.678
It takes experience to run a brewery.
You have none.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.972
I don't plan on doing it alone.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.445
Henry, I want to talk to you.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.200
All right, let's not get excited.

30:28.368 --> 30:31.495
I'm the president of the company.
I'll just hire you back. She has no--

30:31.663 --> 30:35.332
She has the right. She has 51 percent.
That's all the right she needs.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.627
You're right.
Well, what are we going to do?

30:43.758 --> 30:45.092
I have a plan.

30:46.469 --> 30:49.429
Oh, no. No, I want no rough stuff.

30:49.597 --> 30:52.099
Remember, that was our deal. I--

30:52.767 --> 30:54.726
I mean, we had a deal.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.188
- I don't have the stomach for it.
- You stinking hypocrite.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.275
You murdered your own brother.
You had the stomach for that.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.236
The second time. You murdered him first.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.113
He was already dead when I killed him.

31:06.281 --> 31:09.366
I can't go through with that again.
There'll be police, questions.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.828
- I'll crack. I know I will.
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

31:12.996 --> 31:14.913
We are not going to kill anybody.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.040
Excuse me,
we're ready for the exercises.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.208
Good.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.253
You're going to conduct those experiments
with her walking through the brewery?

31:21.421 --> 31:23.046
Suppose she sees something?

31:24.382 --> 31:27.134
- Where are the fools with the mouse?
- They're with Henry Green.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.469
Put them in the game.
Take it to level five.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.471
- Level five?
- Level five.

31:31.639 --> 31:32.806
Do it.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.643
Take this. We've got work to do.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.361
I have to go along with this.

31:46.529 --> 31:49.865
But don't worry, you won't get hurt.
Your equipment should protect you.

31:50.033 --> 31:53.327
Being on the same team as you
is all the padding I need, Rosie.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.996
- Are you okay?
- You okay, hoser?

31:56.164 --> 31:58.123
I am your father, Luke.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.167
Give in to the dark side
of the Force, you knob.

32:00.335 --> 32:03.670
He saw Jedi 17 times, eh? Beauty.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.715
Better go to your goals.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.309
Have a good game, eh?

32:49.842 --> 32:51.009
Where's the puck?

32:52.720 --> 32:53.720
Oh!

32:55.598 --> 32:58.141
The power of the Force stopped you,
you hosers.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.440
Cover your shorts. Don't get deep.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.651
Stick on the ice.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.455
That was no goal, you know.
They were in the crease.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.963
Come back and fight, you hosers.
Come on, eh?

33:31.801 --> 33:32.801
Get off.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.432
My left nut.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.058
Careful.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.769
It's all right. It did that before.

33:42.937 --> 33:46.440
Now, I think he just pressed
one of these buttons here.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.112
- What are you doing?
- It'll just take a moment.

33:52.989 --> 33:56.408
There. You see that?
You see that number? April 4.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.326
That's the day he died.

34:01.372 --> 34:02.789
Wait, look.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.459
That's the tape
they showed at the inquest.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.215
Look.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.360
They killed him.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.447
It looks that way.

34:44.373 --> 34:48.627
Yeah, well, yours are sucky white skates
like a figure skater, eh?

34:48.795 --> 34:50.879
Well, yours are like referee skates.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.005
At least figure skaters
know how to skate, eh?

34:55.342 --> 34:56.342
Hey.

34:57.303 --> 34:59.137
Somebody horked our clothes.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.265
Jeez, who'd want to hork our clothes, eh?

35:02.725 --> 35:06.478
Maybe a couple of these guys got sick
and tired of wearing their pajamas, eh?

35:06.646 --> 35:10.023
- No, they're all on the ice.
- We'd better report this to our boss.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.275
No. Hey, let's go see
if there's a lost and found, eh?

35:12.443 --> 35:15.821
- No, let's report it to our boss.
- No, lost and found's a better idea.

36:06.831 --> 36:07.831
Oh, wow.

36:11.294 --> 36:14.171
- Have you ever been in here before?
- Yeah.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.507
But I've never seen this stuff before.

36:18.050 --> 36:21.469
You certainly don't need
any of this kind of hardware to make beer.

36:26.642 --> 36:29.311
You aren't going to find
the lost and found here.

36:29.478 --> 36:32.564
- I told you that was a mistake.
- I'm skating there, you know.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.608
It's faster.

36:34.775 --> 36:35.775
Ow!

36:36.027 --> 36:37.652
Jeez, those things hurt.

36:39.572 --> 36:42.699
- Who's that?
- Smith's assistant.

36:45.953 --> 36:49.831
Look at this. Every camera on the place
is tied into this console.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.960
- That's us.
- Yeah.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.130
They don't even trust themselves.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.925
It's the guys.

37:04.430 --> 37:09.184
- Are you sure we didn't kill them?
- Just shut up. I have this all worked out.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.150
Ted.

37:17.318 --> 37:21.029
You stupid idiot.
Now he'll be asleep for two hours.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.786
- Beer shower.
- Don't waste it.

37:29.455 --> 37:30.455
Here.

37:30.873 --> 37:33.750
- You asked for it.
- Take off. You hoser.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.295
I told you.

37:37.463 --> 37:40.340
We take them to the loading dock
and put them in beer kegs.

37:41.550 --> 37:42.550
Hurry.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.851
Oh, jeez, look at this place.

37:52.770 --> 37:56.106
- Jeez, what is this, eh?
- It's a nuclear bomb shelter. Come on.

37:57.358 --> 37:58.900
Let's get bombed.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.736
There's probably
beer here somewhere.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.447
Holy jeez! There's a guy over there.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.956
There's the game we were in.
Hey, what's with this guy, eh?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.124
Hey, you.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.503
- You killed him. He's dead.
- I just--

38:18.671 --> 38:21.047
- I'm a witness. Police!
- I didn't do nothing.

38:21.215 --> 38:23.008
- My brother's a murderer.
- Take off.

38:24.093 --> 38:26.011
He's not dead.
Look, his stomach's moving.

38:26.178 --> 38:27.262
Maybe he's just sleeping, eh?

38:27.430 --> 38:29.556
Maybe he's gonna puke.
He had too many beers.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.683
- Where are the beers?
- I'll find them.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.103
Jeez, here's the organ
they were using, eh?

38:47.867 --> 38:48.867
Hey.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.328
Hey, look. Bootlegs.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.038
No wonder everything's secret here.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.622
They're cutting pirates.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.921
Hey, this piano's got a computer, eh?

39:02.757 --> 39:04.299
I don't know how to work it, eh?

39:04.467 --> 39:06.926
Figures you wouldn't know
if it's got a computer.

39:07.094 --> 39:10.347
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Wizard. You know it.
- Let me try. I'm a genius.

39:12.266 --> 39:13.266
Okay, watch this.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.810
These hosers
are skating around in a circle.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.437
Hey, beauty.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.816
- That song's making them fight, eh?
- Yeah. Do it again.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.498
Delvecchio's hurt Gretzky.
They're in the dressing room,

39:36.665 --> 39:37.957
finding out what's to be done.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.085
Pulford and Holman
have been fighting terribly.

39:40.252 --> 39:43.004
Frank Mahovlich's one
of the strongest guys in the league.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.881
He made out okay. What a fight.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.175
Oh, now somebody's thrown
an octopus on the ice

39:47.343 --> 39:49.511
and Litzenberger and Salming are--

40:34.306 --> 40:35.682
How are the brakes?

40:36.016 --> 40:39.352
They got two stops, then no brakes.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.188
Good work.

40:45.359 --> 40:48.027
Listen, about that shooting business.

40:48.737 --> 40:52.615
- I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean it.
- Yeah, okay. Right.

41:05.004 --> 41:08.006
- You boys have a nice nap? Well--
- How's it going?

41:08.174 --> 41:12.093
You're doing a great job for me here,
but I have a special assignment for you.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.471
My daughter, you know, Pamela,

41:14.638 --> 41:17.891
she's having her birthday,
and I want to deliver a couple of kegs.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.642
Very special kegs, for the party.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.978
Jeez, these got beer in them,
these big kegs?

41:22.146 --> 41:25.815
Beer? Oh, yes, beer for the party.
Now, look.

41:25.983 --> 41:29.027
Here's a map, and you must
follow this route precisely

41:29.236 --> 41:32.280
because otherwise you'll get lost,
and she'll be disappointed.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.949
- Where are you guys going, eh?
- What? Get out of here.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.243
Hey, Rosie. We're going to Pam's birthday.
You coming?

41:37.411 --> 41:40.079
It's a business trip.
They're going on a business trip.

41:40.247 --> 41:42.415
So we just go down
to Lakeside Park here, eh?

41:42.583 --> 41:45.752
Yes. It's right at the bottom of the hill.
You can't miss it.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.879
It's right at the bottom of the big hill.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.756
You'd better get started
or you'll be late.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.341
- Okay, eh?
- I'll go with you, eh?

41:51.592 --> 41:52.926
No, you open the door.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.011
- Open the door.
- We're going to get loaded.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.138
Open the door. Come ahead, boys.

42:01.852 --> 42:02.852
Hurry.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.751
Oh, look, everything's under control.
Don't worry, I took care of it.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.002
- So I heard.
- Yes.

42:28.295 --> 42:30.046
Do you mind?
You're a little crowded here.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.756
Just let me out, please.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.800
Send those lunatics back to the institute.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.468
We have to follow the van.

42:35.636 --> 42:37.762
- Back to the institute!
- Do as I say. Hurry.

42:37.930 --> 42:42.559
We have to follow the van. Go back.

42:43.769 --> 42:44.936
Follow the van?

42:45.104 --> 42:47.689
Oh, just to make sure.
That's a great idea.

42:47.856 --> 42:48.856
Get in.

42:49.483 --> 42:50.692
I'll drive.

42:57.032 --> 43:01.744
- Did you feed Hosehead this morning?
- No. I forgot. He was sleeping, eh?

43:01.912 --> 43:05.164
- Well, make up your mind, eh?
- Yeah, he was sleeping.

43:05.499 --> 43:08.334
Well, maybe we ought to go home
and feed him, eh?

43:08.669 --> 43:12.005
- In case the party goes all night?
- We got two kegs.

43:18.762 --> 43:19.762
What are you doing?

43:19.930 --> 43:22.682
Just testing the brakes, eh?
They felt a little soft.

43:30.983 --> 43:34.485
- Where are they going?
- I don't understand it.

43:34.653 --> 43:36.863
I gave them a map. It was all very clear.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.031
Follow them.

43:45.914 --> 43:48.374
Don't be a hog.
We just have time for one quick one.

43:48.542 --> 43:49.709
Okay.

43:50.169 --> 43:53.963
- Last one in the house is a big idiot.
- Take off.

43:58.093 --> 43:59.636
I win, eh?

44:01.221 --> 44:02.221
Nice going.

44:03.557 --> 44:05.058
Oh, jeez.

44:05.267 --> 44:08.353
Take a look at this.
Dad really got into the beers, eh?

44:08.520 --> 44:09.562
Where are they?

44:09.730 --> 44:11.898
Mom? Dad?

44:12.399 --> 44:14.442
- Let's see if they're in their room.
- Don't push.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.235
Come on. Mom! Dad!

44:18.238 --> 44:20.073
- Take off, eh?
- Get out.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.408
Sorry.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.828
I didn't know they were in there.

44:25.996 --> 44:27.372
Can you believe it?

44:30.084 --> 44:31.793
Get his bowl quick,
or he'll kill us.

44:32.419 --> 44:34.420
Yeah, he's got
a funny look in his eye, eh?

44:39.385 --> 44:41.803
What the stink are they doing in there?

44:44.973 --> 44:46.808
Would you like me to tilt your chair back?

44:47.017 --> 44:48.101
Shut up.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.269
Twenty cans ought to be enough, eh?

44:50.437 --> 44:53.272
We're going to a party.
Don't eat the furniture.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.526
- I got to get some new underwear.
- Jeez, bootlegs.

44:56.694 --> 44:57.944
Remember where we got this?

44:58.112 --> 45:00.196
It was where they were running off
them pirates, eh?

45:00.447 --> 45:01.447
Was that a dream?

45:01.657 --> 45:03.116
It was no dream. It was in your underwear.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.951
- Okay, let's see.
- What are you going to do?

45:05.119 --> 45:08.621
It's one of them new square records, eh,
that goes, like, on a--

45:08.831 --> 45:11.666
On a record player that's, like,
on its side, eh?

45:11.834 --> 45:14.544
No way. That's an EP
from some British New Wave band.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.337
Take off. You don't know.

45:16.505 --> 45:17.839
Yeah, they bootleg those, eh?

45:18.006 --> 45:19.924
What do you think?

45:20.134 --> 45:23.094
- Sounds like a British New Wave band.
- Yeah. Beauty sound.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.430
- Beauty.
- Not my style of music, eh?

45:26.014 --> 45:29.225
Hey, Hosehead. Here's another one
for your collection, eh?

45:30.144 --> 45:32.437
Beauty. Hank Aaron. Wonder if he can hit.

45:35.482 --> 45:36.733
There they are.

45:37.818 --> 45:40.570
- Hey, who's driving?
- I am because you're too loaded to drive.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.448
Take off. I am not.
Just getting warmed up for the party, eh?

45:43.615 --> 45:46.325
You can't drink and drive
at the same time, hoser.

46:16.482 --> 46:19.025
It's nice to get away
from the brewery once in a while.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.402
Take a little drive, you know?

46:22.905 --> 46:25.865
Hey, did you ever notice that in movies

46:26.033 --> 46:29.577
when they're driving, they don't look
at the road for a long time?

46:30.496 --> 46:32.830
- Jeez, no, I'd never noticed that.
- Yeah.

46:32.998 --> 46:35.041
That's because they're being towed, eh?

46:35.292 --> 46:36.876
- Really?
- By a rig.

47:00.108 --> 47:02.401
- We have them now.
- Just like I told you.

47:07.074 --> 47:09.617
What's going on? Will you stop this thing?

47:11.453 --> 47:13.454
The brakes aren't working.

47:19.586 --> 47:23.047
- Try the parking brake, eh?
- Take off. The parking brake never worked.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.007
These cops are going to arrest us.

47:29.429 --> 47:32.598
- No point in steering now.
- Take off. You steer this thing.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.779
The wharf. The end of the wharf.

49:18.914 --> 49:19.914
Help!

49:21.083 --> 49:22.708
You'd better call an ambulance.

49:41.895 --> 49:45.064
- All right now. Come on.
- Careful now.

49:46.858 --> 49:49.235
- Easy.
- Come on, get the rope off her.

49:51.196 --> 49:52.905
They're down at the end of the wharf, sir.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.241
All right. You better follow us there.

49:55.534 --> 49:57.076
Hey, you guys, follow him.

50:03.417 --> 50:04.959
I'll call an ambulance.

50:06.253 --> 50:09.005
- Put her down right over here.
- Let me get a blanket.

50:16.096 --> 50:18.014
- We got a cover.
- She's all right.

50:18.181 --> 50:20.516
Back off. Let's have a look here.

50:20.684 --> 50:21.892
You all right?

50:27.190 --> 50:30.109
- Okay, she's fainted. Call an ambulance.
- It's on its way, sir.

50:39.286 --> 50:43.080
Down there ten minutes?
Nobody can last that long.

50:43.373 --> 50:44.790
Not Houdini, not nobody.

52:49.791 --> 52:51.792
- Hey, hoser.
- What?

52:51.960 --> 52:53.836
Okay, that's it. That's enough.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.923
Those big cons are going to love you, eh?

52:58.091 --> 53:00.176
- What do you mean?
- You're a cute little guy.

53:00.343 --> 53:01.969
They're going to be loving you
from dawn until dusk.

53:02.137 --> 53:03.179
Turn!

53:03.430 --> 53:07.433
- Where are you going to be?
- I'll be in the cafeteria selling smokes.

53:07.726 --> 53:11.020
All right, single file.
Down here. Step it up. Move it.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.564
- They're going to kill us all.
- Hands in your pockets.

53:13.732 --> 53:15.065
Back against the wall.

53:15.275 --> 53:18.194
Feet together. Come on, straighten up.
Look straight ahead.

53:18.361 --> 53:20.112
- Straighten up, I said.
- Okay, eh?

53:20.447 --> 53:21.780
That's it. Okay.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.241
Try to pick out the men who kidnapped you.

53:24.409 --> 53:26.035
- That's her.
- Hey, how you doing?

53:26.203 --> 53:28.704
- Come on. Get back there.
- That's her. She was--

53:28.872 --> 53:29.914
- Quiet.
- Okay.

53:30.081 --> 53:32.791
- He can't get any further back--
- Shut up.

54:01.655 --> 54:04.949
- What did the doctor say?
- Catatonic schizophrenia.

54:06.201 --> 54:07.201
What?

54:07.410 --> 54:11.664
Schizophrenia marked by an excessive
and sometimes violent motor activity

54:11.873 --> 54:13.707
or by generalized inhibition.

54:14.709 --> 54:17.461
Sounds like you just picked that out
of the dictionary.

54:17.629 --> 54:20.339
No, that's exactly
what the doctor told us.

54:20.507 --> 54:22.258
I have a photographic memory, you know?

54:22.425 --> 54:24.551
- Really?
- Oh, yes, I never forget a thing.

54:25.011 --> 54:27.805
Well, that might be useful
in my investigation of this case.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.182
Well, feel free
to call upon me at any time.

54:34.104 --> 54:37.022
My compliments on the many fine things
you have in your home.

54:37.190 --> 54:38.857
- Well, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.819
- Bonaparte.
- Uh, Napoleon, actually.

54:42.028 --> 54:43.028
Yeah.

54:43.530 --> 54:47.908
- What would a thing like that cost?
- Oh, $4,000 or $5,000. I don't remember.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.454
Who chiseled this?

54:52.956 --> 54:57.126
It was some sculptor, I think.
I'm terrible on names.

54:57.294 --> 55:00.045
I thought you said
you have a photographic memory.

55:00.880 --> 55:04.341
Oh, well, normally I would, but--

55:04.509 --> 55:06.093
- Darling?
- Ah, my wife.

55:06.261 --> 55:10.055
- You didn't tell me we had company.
- I think you know the Inspector, dear.

55:10.223 --> 55:11.724
- Hello.
- My wife.

55:12.142 --> 55:14.310
- How is she?
- She's about the same, I'm afraid.

55:14.477 --> 55:18.188
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She hasn't said a word since the accident.

55:18.356 --> 55:21.525
- I hope it's not something that I've done.
- No, of course not.

55:21.693 --> 55:23.152
Well, the Inspector has to leave.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.279
Oh, wouldn't you like
a drink or something?

55:25.447 --> 55:26.864
No, he wouldn't, he'd love to,

55:27.032 --> 55:28.782
- but he has to run.
- Oh.

55:28.950 --> 55:30.909
- Good night.
- Thank you, Inspector.

55:33.204 --> 55:35.581
I hope she'll be able to testify
tomorrow morning.

55:35.749 --> 55:38.959
Who? Oh, yes, we hope so.

55:39.919 --> 55:41.211
- Good night.
- 'Bye.

55:47.093 --> 55:49.928
Chimp here does the killing.
I don't like to kill.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.431
I'm the brains, eh?

55:52.807 --> 55:55.893
We got over $5 billion in our hideout.

55:56.436 --> 55:59.730
Only some of the money's marked, eh,
so we're not spending it.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.106
We're just waiting.

56:01.274 --> 56:03.942
- You guys like a smoke?
- No, eh?

56:05.195 --> 56:07.696
We want our lungs
to be pink when they fry us.

56:08.990 --> 56:11.075
We told them we didn't want a lawyer.

56:11.493 --> 56:13.952
Chimp here would probably
just kill him anyway.

56:14.913 --> 56:16.622
Lawyers are for sucks.

56:17.457 --> 56:19.708
McKenzie brothers. Your lawyer's here.

56:32.597 --> 56:35.307
- You can talk in here.
- Okay.

56:36.768 --> 56:39.561
- Hi, I'm Jack Hawkland, your lawyer.
- How's it going, eh?

56:39.938 --> 56:42.773
How's it going, Mr. Hawkland?
I remember you from the office, eh?

56:42.941 --> 56:46.193
You're very observant.
I'll make this as simple as possible.

56:46.820 --> 56:49.071
The two of you have been charged
with kidnapping

56:49.239 --> 56:51.782
under Section 2471 of the Criminal Code.

56:51.950 --> 56:54.576
The offense of kidnapping
is comprised of two elements.

56:54.744 --> 56:57.538
Both of which must be satisfied
before a conviction may lie.

56:57.705 --> 57:02.000
The first element, actus reus,
which was satisfied on October 10, 1983,

57:02.168 --> 57:06.004
when you, Robert and Douglas McKenzie,
did kidnap one Pamela Elsinore.

57:06.172 --> 57:10.134
- Wait a sec. We didn't do it.
- Yeah, that's right. We's innocent, eh?

57:10.301 --> 57:13.011
If you're innocent
then you have nothing to fear.

57:18.643 --> 57:21.061
- Beauty.
- We'll get off, eh?

57:23.857 --> 57:26.525
Exhibit A.
It's an open-and-shut case.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.194
- Shall I time-code it?
- Yes.

57:31.030 --> 57:32.906
Now what about that missing disc?

57:38.496 --> 57:41.373
- How did he get the code?
- Random chance.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.292
That's impossible.

57:44.210 --> 57:45.210
Play it back.

57:46.087 --> 57:48.338
Give me magnification on the code pad.

57:54.929 --> 57:58.932
That's not our code.
Get me the John Elsinore disc.

58:13.364 --> 58:15.199
Look at this.

58:24.667 --> 58:26.293
What the hell was that?

58:31.424 --> 58:33.675
There's no scientific explanation for it.

58:35.136 --> 58:36.929
It's pointless to worry.

58:44.521 --> 58:45.521
Let me see.

58:46.105 --> 58:49.233
There's 11, 12, 13.

58:51.819 --> 58:53.987
They knew exactly what they were doing.

58:54.489 --> 58:57.115
They took the one disc
that would incriminate me.

58:58.451 --> 58:59.952
What are we going to do now?

59:04.415 --> 59:06.875
We will move towards Oktoberfest
as planned,

59:08.670 --> 59:11.588
and I will not underestimate
our little friends again.

59:15.176 --> 59:16.843
Do you want me to light it up?

59:17.595 --> 59:18.595
No.

59:24.143 --> 59:28.564
- Hey, there's Hawkland.
- It's the press. I'll handle them.

59:28.731 --> 59:32.234
Mr. Hawkland,
can we just get one quick shot of you?

59:32.402 --> 59:34.361
Mr. Hawkland.

59:37.782 --> 59:39.324
Mr. Hawkland, what--

59:44.372 --> 59:46.999
That's how you handle the press. Come on.

59:56.509 --> 59:59.761
- We're late. Let's go.
- Remind me to pay his bill on time, eh?

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:03.015
- Yeah, Chuck Norris for the defense, eh?
- Beauties.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:10.897
Your Worship, I wish to plead
my clients guilty to statutes

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:14.693
125 and 233 of the Criminal Code

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:18.530
and not guilty to all other charges
due to mental incompetence.

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.825
Objection.
You cannot split pleas like that.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.411
Two bowls of split plea soup to go, eh?

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.623
- Is your nose bleeding?
- Yeah.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.416
Your Honor? Mr. Judge?

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.251
My brother's got a bleeding--

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:33.962
My brother's got a bleeding nose.
We need some Kleenex.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.590
- Clerk, please.
- Clerk is gonna give you some Kleenex.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:54.149
And this, sir, is the same tape
that your engineer retrieved

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:59.196
from the television cameras
that monitor the activity in your brewery?

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.948
Oh, yes. And I'd like to point out

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:06.870
that this tape has not been
tampered with or edited in any way.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:12.084
It even has a time-code on it,
and those are very difficult to fake.

01:01:13.294 --> 01:01:17.339
For the benefit of the court,
would you please explain "time-code"?

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.930
Just because I don't know what it is,
doesn't mean I'm lying.

01:01:25.264 --> 01:01:27.849
- It usually stops bleeding by now, eh?
- This isn't working.

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.768
Give me something quick.
A couple of bullets.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.270
Maybe we should call
the Red Cross or something.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:35.482
- Here. Try these.
- Good idea. Beauty, clerk.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.486
Beauty.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:43.073
May I remind you two idiots
that this is a court of law?

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:45.492
He's the one with the bleeding nose.
I didn't do nothing.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.910
Proceed, Counselor.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.247
Would you state your name
and occupation, please?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.458
Doctor B.M. Smith,
Resident Head of Psychiatry

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:56.670
at the Royal Canadian Institute
for the Mentally Insane.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:02:00.298
Now, Dr. Smith, we know
you are familiar with this case.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.637
The victim, Pamela Elsinore,
is currently in your care at the RCIMI.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.347
That is correct.

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:11.435
Dr. Smith, would you say
that you are sufficiently familiar

01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:14.980
with the defendants
to give us a preliminary diagnosis?

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:20.485
I am. I would say, without a doubt, that
they suffer from paranoid schizophrenia.

01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:24.823
Would you kindly explain to the court
what that means?

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:30.829
That is schizophrenia marked by excessive
and sometimes violent motor activity

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.290
or by generalized inhibition.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.126
- I do.
- I do.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:38.211
I guess we're married, clerk.

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:40.756
- Where's the honeymoon?
- Order. Order.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.049
Give me a toasted back bacon,
hold the toast.

01:02:43.217 --> 01:02:44.259
Don't make me laugh, eh?

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.637
I must instruct you
not to speak unless you are spoken to.

01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:52.058
He's starting to sound like the old man.
Pretty soon he'll send me out for beers.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.774
All right!

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:00.400
Order! Order!

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.571
Until the victim is
mentally fit for trial,

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.616
I want these two lunatics

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:11.161
confined under the psychiatric care

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.038
of Dr. Smith

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:18.502
at the Royal Canadian Institute
for the Mentally Insane.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:22.005
This hearing is adjourned.

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.562
- Take off.
- If you put--

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.565
- It's my side. Don't go over that line.
- What line? Where?

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:42.734
- There is a line.
- If you put your mouth--

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:43.985
Take off. I'm going to do the steamroller.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.987
Take off! No way!

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.992
- Steamroller. I'm steamrolling you.
- Take off.

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:56.039
Steamroller!

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:05.674
Hi, fellows. My name's Ted,
and I'm happy to be working with you.

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.097
Somebody help us, please!

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100
I'll reconnect this.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:18.603
Forget it. Dr. Smith is doing the lobotomy
in the morning.

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.138
Doctor, thank God you're here!

01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:07.986
We lost him.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.656
What did you give him?

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:14.451
This is just the thing,
a hypodermic needle.

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:15.994
Excuse me.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.498
Help! Stop that man! Stop him!

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:38.058
- $6.50.
- Here. This ought to be worth $6.50.

01:05:38.225 --> 01:05:40.977
No, I don't want it! $6.50! Hey!

01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:44.689
I got your license number.
You rich bum! $6.50.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:48.610
Hey, you! $6.50!

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:52.697
Hey, you! Let me see your ticket! $6.50!

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:55.325
All I've got is two fives.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:58.787
- Who was in this bed?
- Jean LaRose.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.206
Jean LaRose, the hockey player?

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:04.668
- I don't know. Yes, I guess so.
- Is this the available bed?

01:06:04.835 --> 01:06:07.754
No, I don't know where he is.
This is the one. He's dead.

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:10.799
- Well, get him out of that bed.
- That's not my job, I'm sorry.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.009
Not your job?
Do you want him to mummify?

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:14.928
You're asking me to do
all sorts of crazy things.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:16.221
Get the man out of the bed!

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.932
It isn't my business anymore.
I won't listen to you--

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:21.059
What have you done with the disc?

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.728
What are you looking at me for?
I don't got it.

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:28.149
Maybe it's out of gas, eh?

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:33.405
- You farted!
- No, it wasn't me. It was the chair, eh?

01:06:33.572 --> 01:06:36.908
- He's lying! Check the machine.
- No. I'm not lying.

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:39.744
He's lying, all right.

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:41.746
I don't need no machine
to tell me that, eh?

01:06:41.914 --> 01:06:44.916
- I didn't do it, I swear.
- Don't slice cheese in here, will you?

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.084
Take off!

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:50.422
- All right, come on. Down the hall.
- All right, don't be a bully, eh?

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.260
There's those guys who horked our clothes.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.220
How come you're
not playing hockey, eh?

01:06:57.388 --> 01:07:00.515
- Okay, I know my rights.
- Hey, who's in this room?

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:02.851
- Get away!
- Pam's in there.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.936
- Get away from there!
- Pam is in there. Ow!

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.647
All right, don't touch anything.
I'll be right back.

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:32.547
What was that?

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.926
Let's get out of here.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:51.024
- How's that?
- Beauty. Take it up to 30 this time.

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:52.484
No way! My turn! I want to--

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:53.902
Okay, eh?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.655
- I'll just disconnect these.
- Hello? No, he went out, eh?

01:07:57.823 --> 01:07:59.657
Like he went to get a pizza.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:01.451
Who is this?

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:04.245
Jeez. The guy hung up. Okay!

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:07.082
Put this in your mouth
so you don't bite your tongue off.

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.167
- Beauty.
- Hey, let's try the head this time.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.668
Beauty. Okay.

01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:13.922
If you'd stick to your 12-point
maintenance program, eh,

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.716
then we wouldn't have
to jump-start you like this.

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:20.929
But, oh, no, you had to do it your way.
You think you know everything, eh?

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:25.433
Okay. There we go.
I'm going to take it up to 90 this time.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.394
Hey, get away from there!
Don't touch those things!

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:30.688
No, no! You're always touching things!

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:32.398
- Take off, eh?
- He's party-pooping.

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:34.526
Hey, some guy called for you
while you was out, eh?

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.528
- A call for me?
- Yeah.

01:08:36.694 --> 01:08:38.654
- Okay, do it now.
- No, no! He'll get mad.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:42.367
- Oh, come on. What about my turn?
- We're going to do this instead.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.703
- How's it going, eh?
- Shh!

01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:47.580
- It's going pretty good.
- Shh!

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:56.214
- He doesn't like him much.
- Where's Pam? I got to find Pam.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:58.966
Jeez, I saw her down the hall before,
but she was dozing off, eh?

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.176
Come on!

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:01.426
Come on!

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.430
Oh, jeez,
but we have to come back for my turn, eh?

01:09:04.598 --> 01:09:07.392
One guy just drove away with the car
from here and he gave me this.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.562
Maybe he's a doctor.
And one guy stole the car from over there.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:11.979
My coat, too.

01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:15.233
- Okay, let's take a look, sir.
- He was not wearing any clothes.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:18.236
He was wearing pajamas.
He stole my coat and hit me.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:29.413
Hey!

01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:30.665
Pursue him!

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:34.169
- But I saw you drown.
- They saved my life.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.339
You saved my life.

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:41.593
What are you doing in here?

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.846
Oh, uh, we're from the Department of
Justice, and we're adjusting the beds.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.974
This is Mr. Roy, our consultant.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:52.103
- Two minutes for elbowing.
- Let's get out of here!

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.452
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:14.959
Where are all these hosers going, eh?

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:17.462
- There's a tunnel to the brewery.
- Let's go!

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:20.882
- Jeez, I ain't playing hockey again.
- Tunnel to the brewery. Take off!

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.050
How convenient!

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:40.360
What is it you want?

01:10:40.527 --> 01:10:42.737
What's going on?
Didn't we pay our electric bill?

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:43.905
The circuits are fusing.

01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:47.200
The computers, the surveillance system,
everything seems to be overloading.

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:48.826
- And I think Ted is dead.
- Ted?

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:51.120
- Yes.
- Oh, my God! Look.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:56.042
It's him! It's my brother!
Oh, no, John! He wants revenge!

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.087
I know it! He's going to kill us!
I didn't do it! It wasn't me!

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.881
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!
Turn this thing off!

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:04.133
I should never have listened to you!

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:07.011
Shut up!

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.183
I could crush your head like a nut.

01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:15.520
But I won't

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:17.772
because I need you!

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:20.692
Now, go to the loading dock.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:24.362
Make sure the trucks leave
for Oktoberfest as planned.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.201
Do as I say.

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:43.756
They put some stuff in the beer.
And they make us drink it every day.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.718
My father must have found out about that.

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:48.803
That's why they killed him.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.933
- Come on! This way!
- How long is this tunnel, eh?

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:56.477
I'm having a heart attack.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.942
Wait! I want to go to the cafeteria.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.153
You go with her. You come with me.

01:12:06.196 --> 01:12:07.238
Be careful.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:11.075
- Don't worry, I will.
- Come on!

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.415
See you, eh?

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:19.709
Yeah.

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:21.878
Good day, eh?

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:30.595
Jeez, I'm sure glad we got rid of them.
They were really starting to bug me, eh?

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.597
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah, okay.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.433
You mean you've never been apart?

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:39.187
No, never. We always stick together.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.439
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.402
- Where's the other one?
- He's dead, Smith. You killed him.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:47.612
Oh, good.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.698
There's one less to worry about then.
Now come this way.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.162
Now hurry up!

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:02.794
Hurry up! Come on, let's go! I saw that!

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:16.182
- This the one stolen from the hospital?
- That's it.

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.185
- Japanese, eh?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:19.978 --> 01:13:21.229
Guess the whole world's made in Japan.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:22.814
Could be, sir.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:41.207
How ironic!
You came here with a mouse in a bottle.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.917
Now you are the mouse.

01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:46.546
- As for you, my dear--
- Don't worry about me, Smith.

01:13:46.713 --> 01:13:50.007
I wrote everything I know in a letter
and mailed it to the newspapers.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:51.592
When did you do that?

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.012
Very good, my dear.
Cunning, right to the end.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:59.183
But, unfortunately,
we find the mail system unreliable here

01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:01.018
so we use private couriers.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:02.728
Nice try.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:06.732
It's really too bad you won't be around
to see the whole world

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.901
become addicted to Elsinore beer.

01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:11.988
In a few hours
I will introduce my special formula

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.365
to the public at Oktoberfest.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:17.952
When they drink enough
they'll do whatever I tell them.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.204
You know, people can tell
what's in beer, eh?

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:24.041
My brother can tell the difference between
beers by what his burps taste like.

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:25.710
Your brother is dead.

01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:31.799
But he's not really dead.
I just told him that when you fainted.

01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:37.722
Can I buy you a beer?

01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:45.396
Let's run it all again.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:47.565
- It's a lot to remember.
- You know what to do?

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:49.400
- I think so.
- Okay. See you later.

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:50.818
Okay. See you.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:56.324
My brother and I used to say
that drowning in beer was like heaven, eh?

01:14:57.409 --> 01:15:00.453
Now he's not here, and I got two soakers.

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:03.331
- This isn't heaven. This sucks.
- Don't talk.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:07.001
Try and use as little oxygen as possible,
and maybe when the level rises,

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.212
we can get up to that porthole.

01:15:36.406 --> 01:15:38.324
I think it's getting warmer in here.

01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:42.286
I didn't notice anything.

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.262
No, fellows. No exercises today.

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:04.976
No, fellows. Forget about it.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:11.190
No, look, can we talk this over, fellows?

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.859
No, wait, fellows!

01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:16.612
Let me alone! Wait!
You can't do this to me!

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.947
I'm in charge here!

01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:09.433
Come on, Doug!
They're in the vat room. Let's go!

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.865
Stand back. This is really going to blow.

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:31.831
Didn't blow. Anybody home?

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.502
I can't believe it. He drank it all!
Help me out.

01:18:41.925 --> 01:18:44.468
You've got to help him.
You've got to get him out of there.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:45.928
Thanks.

01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:51.434
Oh, no! Geez, I have to take a leak
so bad I can taste it.

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:00.192
What are you doing walking around?
I thought you were sick.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.986
There's a guy back there trapped in a vat.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:04.905
- Somebody tried to kill him.
- You stay here. Come on.

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:10.828
Out of the way. Come on.

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:12.538
- Cops!
- Clear out, clear out.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:15.666
Holy shit!

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:17.835
- How did he get in there?
- I didn't do it!

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.253
How do we get him out?

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.921
Let's try to cut him out
with a blow torch.

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.673
You couldn't cut that with a torch.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.675
I don't know.
We need an explosives expert.

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:27.803
No, don't blow him up!
He's my brother. Please don't hurt him!

01:19:27.971 --> 01:19:29.972
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.516
He's going to take a leak.
Get out of the way!

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:43.611
Hey, get me out of here, will you?
I got a wiz to throw!

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:45.529
Boy, that was some belch!

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:47.698
We thought you were going to take a leak.

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:50.451
What do you mean?
Just get me out of here, eh?

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.120
- Come on, eh, you hoser.
- I'll get you out.

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:56.081
I would have saved you some,
but I had to save everyone's life, eh.

01:19:56.249 --> 01:19:58.125
Yeah, well.
Gee, I don't know how to do this.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.877
Oh! Not there.

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:02.338
- Okay, how about here?
- Ooh, that feels good.

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:50.177
I think I'd better go.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.866
- What the hell was that?
- It wasn't me.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:15.160
The roof just blew off the institute.
It's on fire.

01:21:15.453 --> 01:21:19.290
On fire? Geez!
Hey, can you hold on for a minute?

01:21:19.457 --> 01:21:21.876
Yeah, okay.
But hurry, will you, I got to go.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.920
Yeah. Help me get him out of here.
I've got an idea.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:33.470
- Are you done yet?
- Yeah.

01:21:33.638 --> 01:21:34.638
Beauty.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.266
Hey, you did a fine job, son.

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:40.144
What took you two minutes
would have taken us two hours.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:43.188
You ever want a job with
the Fire Department, come and see me.

01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:44.398
You got it, eh.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.066
What about my brother?
Can he get a job?

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:48.485
- You boys want to come with us?
- Where are you going?

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:50.988
- Oktoberfest.
- Geez, I've had enough beer for a while.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:53.407
Two trucks full of bad beer
went there this morning.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.367
We have to stop the people drinking it.

01:21:55.535 --> 01:21:57.786
That's a thirsty crowd. It won't be easy.

01:21:57.954 --> 01:22:00.539
Okay, I got an idea,
but we got to go home first, okay?

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.207
- Come on.
- You guys, go with them.

01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:05.419
- How come we're going home?
- Don't worry about it.

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.504
Put these clothes on.
I'll tell you about it on the way.

01:22:07.672 --> 01:22:08.756
Okay.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.729
Here.

01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:26.565
Elsinore beer,
will go right over there.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:28.442
- Okay.
- Right over there, please.

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:29.860
You got it.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:33.697
Okay, eh, all cops, eh,
get out of your cars.

01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:39.370
Okay. I want to take a head count, uh,
like maybe we'll have some breakfast, eh.

01:22:39.537 --> 01:22:42.039
Some back bacon sandwiches
while we're waiting.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:43.290
Okay, another thing. Um...

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.501
You all went through the "Stop" sign
over there.

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:47.252
And that's a moving violation.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.255
And my brother and I, uh,
we have a lot of parking tickets.

01:22:50.423 --> 01:22:51.715
- Hey, hoser!
- What?

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:56.553
My brother's coming in now,
so, all cops, come on up here now.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:59.348
Sit. Okay.

01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:00.975
- Got a map?
- Map.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.518
Yeah, right here.

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:06.814
Okay, this is like an aerial view.
Okay, take the 401.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:11.360
Take the 401 to Kitchener here,
and then take Highway 6 north.

01:23:11.528 --> 01:23:13.988
Because it goes right up here.
That's the off-ramp.

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.781
No. Right there's the off-ramp.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.658
Don't forget to make a right
at Highway 6, eh.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.826
Yeah. Okay?

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:22.287
When you get there, you can have all
the free beer and sausages you can eat.

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:45.853
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:51.400
We are very happy to announce
that today all the beer is free.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:58.532
Courtesy from our good friends
at Elsinore Brewery.

01:24:40.658 --> 01:24:41.992
Skunk!

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:04.181
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:25:12.023 --> 01:25:14.817
I wouldn't go in there.
There's a big skunk in there.

01:25:14.984 --> 01:25:17.778
We know that.
It's a Toronto skunk. My jurisdiction.

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:19.196
Right.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:29.581
It's okay, it's okay.

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:31.708
Well, boys, it worked.

01:25:31.876 --> 01:25:35.129
Worked! I can't thank you enough.
I really can't.

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:39.299
That's, uh, some dog of yours, too.
He's really hungry, isn't he?

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:40.926
Yeah, he's always hungry, eh.

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:43.887
We couldn't feed him, eh,
because we was in jail.

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:47.057
- You put us there. Thanks a lot!
- Yeah, we was innocent, too.

01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:48.517
She told you we were innocent.

01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:50.519
- Just a second, boys.
- Okay, Inspector.

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:53.105
Now, maybe,
we can drop the criminal charges,

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:55.149
but, believe me,
that mental incompetence bit

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.317
will be, ahem, tough to beat.

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:58.694
I'll take care of them.

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:02.698
From now on they're working full time
at the brewery for me and Rosie.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.576
- Beauty.
- Come on.

01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:07.077
- Let's go, dear.
- Beauty, eh?

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:09.246
- Let's go, dear.
- See you, Inspector.

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:13.667
Pam?

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:15.252
Oh, sorry, eh.

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:17.087
We was wondering, eh, like, uh,

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:20.507
just exactly
what is wrong with the beer, eh?

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:23.343
- Is it poison? Like, could it kill you?
- No, no.

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.221
It's not a poison.
It's, uh, more like a drug.

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:28.849
It can wear off in time
like it did with me, eh.

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:32.811
Oh. We was thinking since we're employees
of the brewery now, eh,

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:36.773
like, perhaps
it would be, uh, a good idea for us

01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:40.444
to take, like, all the contaminated beer
back to the brewery

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:42.654
where it can be properly disposed of, eh?

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:44.990
You know how to handle
one of those big rigs?

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:47.451
- Geez, a ten-speed!
- Yeah, sure, of course.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:50.829
- Like, uh, we drive them all the time, eh.
- Well, take off, eh.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:52.497
- Beauty! Come on!
- You're lying.

01:26:52.832 --> 01:26:54.875
It's okay, don't worry.
Trust me. Come here.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.585
- You're lying.
- I want to talk to you.

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:58.128
- You're tricking me.
- Come here.

01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:00.172
If you're sucking me in--
I knew you would.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.590
- You're lying!
- Take off!

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:03.926
- You don't know how to drive this.
- I do.

01:27:04.093 --> 01:27:05.844
It's a 10-speed. A five-speed times two.

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:07.763
We're going to crash.
We'll be in the water again.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:09.973
Take off! We are not going to crash, eh!

01:27:10.433 --> 01:27:13.101
There's no way I'll crash this.
This is a beer truck, eh.

01:28:02.485 --> 01:28:03.485
Oh, jeez!

01:28:03.736 --> 01:28:05.862
Good day.
Welcome to the end of the movie, eh.

01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:08.699
- Yeah. How'd you like it?
- Yeah. I'm Bob McKenzie.

01:28:08.866 --> 01:28:11.994
- This is my brother, Doug.
- Oh, excuse me. How's it going?

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:15.038
I was drinking during the beer
because I had such--

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.708
- During the movie, I mean.
- He's loaded, eh. He's gone.

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:21.169
- Okay, I've had a couple. So?
- Okay. Time for the movie review, eh.

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:23.714
At least I don't have a voice
like Jiminy Cricket.

01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:26.383
Okay. Movie review. Okay.
I thought it was beauty.

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.010
What did you think, Doug?

01:28:28.177 --> 01:28:31.888
Well, I thought there were
a couple of, uh, minor, uh, story flaws,

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:36.852
but, all in all, it was a good $5's
worth for me and my whole family.

01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:43.859
Okay, I'd like to thank The Academy
for this beer, eh.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:47.863
It's beauty.
I'll put it on my mantel and, um,

01:28:48.072 --> 01:28:52.075
- you know, try to keep it cold. Okay.
- Try and keep dust off it, too.

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:55.829
How 'bout all those people who left early,
eh, when the movie was ending, eh?

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:59.082
They got their cars out now
and you got to see this, eh.

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.418
Beauty.
It's like leaving a ballgame early, eh.

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:05.547
They thought they were going to get out,
instead they missed all this great stuff.

01:29:05.715 --> 01:29:06.715
Yeah, beauty.

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:10.177
All these names that are going by,
these guys worked on the movie, eh.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.804
Like, uh, this guy here. He was beauty.

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:16.600
Mind you, he ate a lot at mealtime, eh.
He was always late.

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:17.768
Here goes another one.

01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:19.186
It's great to do a movie and get to learn

01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:21.605
what all the stuff means,
eh, like "grip," eh.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:24.066
I never knew what grips were, eh.
You know what they are, eh?

01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:26.109
Guys that wear tools on their belts.

01:29:26.277 --> 01:29:28.070
And they live, like,
up in the rafters, eh.

01:29:28.237 --> 01:29:30.447
They come early in the morning
and go up there,

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:33.116
and you don't see them all day.
Then they go out.

01:29:33.284 --> 01:29:34.910
They're sort of like
a different breed, eh.

01:29:35.119 --> 01:29:36.161
Or gaffers?

01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:38.955
- You know what a "gaffer" is, eh?
- Living proof of evolution.

01:29:39.123 --> 01:29:42.250
He's the guy that, like, you know,
he gaffs. Gaff for us.

01:29:44.253 --> 01:29:45.629
That's what a gaffer does.

01:29:46.964 --> 01:29:47.964
Okay.

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:50.801
What? Two minutes is up?

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.470
- Two minutes and holding.
- Okay.

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:56.473
He's going to blast off in a minute.
You ever seen him do that?

01:29:56.641 --> 01:30:00.060
You ever see at the end of movies,
uh, when they, like, freeze frame?

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:01.520
Okay, freeze the frame.

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:03.814
Okay.

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:07.526
You ever see in the movies
cowboys ride off into the sunset?

01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:11.988
When you heard the whistle blow,
they ride off, ride off.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:14.658
Happy trails. See you.

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:16.701
'Bye now.

01:30:24.043 --> 01:30:25.043
English - SDH
