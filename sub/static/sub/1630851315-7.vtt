10:52.608 --> 10:53.914
It's rock and bowl.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.568
Which I guess really
is just bowling,

10:56.612 --> 10:57.918
but with music.

10:57.961 --> 11:00.398
I may have oversold it.Can-can you...?

11:00.442 --> 11:03.271
Just... [clears throat]

11:03.314 --> 11:04.925
Um...

11:07.275 --> 11:08.624
Mm-hmm?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.626
I am not ready for that.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.498
Really? It's easy to learn.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.848
As long as you don't mind
renting the shoes.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.850
No, I'm not...
I'm not ready for...

11:16.893 --> 11:18.939
for talking
about dating at work.

11:18.982 --> 11:22.899
I'm not talking about dating.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.727
You want us to go bowling
and eat nachos or whatever.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.903
That is a date.I'm sorry.
You're-you're the one

11:26.947 --> 11:28.731
who came bouncing in with
the whole bracelet thing.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.995
Yes, and... people saw.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.997
Ernie's not people.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.651
I mean, not
technically.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.305
It puts pressure on me.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.266
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.268
where's the Whistler
from this morning?

11:44.312 --> 11:45.661
And can you bring her back?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.750
Look, I ju... I just think

11:47.794 --> 11:51.275
we-we need to keep things...
compartmented.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.495
Yeah. I don't know. Secret.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.062
Just for now at least.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.675
Is this about the phone call
you just had?

12:00.763 --> 12:03.374
My phone call has nothing
to do with anything.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.466
Okay. Well, I don't want
to be compartmented.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.946
And I don't like
these kinds of secrets,

12:09.990 --> 12:11.513
so if you...You know, uh, thank you.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.645
Thank you, Special Agent Tara.
We can...

12:13.689 --> 12:15.909
We can resolve this matter
later, okay?

12:15.952 --> 12:17.301
[indistinct chatter]

12:17.345 --> 12:19.347
[clears throat]

12:20.696 --> 12:22.350
[exhales]

12:24.395 --> 12:25.788
JESSE:
Blood and DNA

12:25.832 --> 12:27.964
from the scene
is on its way to the lab.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.750
Dave Andrews was killed
at Tracy's house,

12:30.793 --> 12:32.795
so she's involved somehow.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.710
Did you get that yogurt
from our kitchen?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.668
Yeah. Why?

12:36.712 --> 12:39.584
It's not a free-for-all
in there.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.064
I have low blood sugar.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.326
TENNANT:
Guys?

12:42.370 --> 12:44.328
Tracy.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.722
Well, if she's involved,
she's not talking.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.376
She's acting cagey.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.551
'Cause of guilt?

12:49.594 --> 12:51.814
Or 'cause she's guarded.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.424
She's a Black
female swimmer

12:53.468 --> 12:55.426
who wears blue,
metaphorically speaking.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.906
She's earned
some hesitation.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.821
Need to respect it.Well,

12:58.865 --> 13:03.391
I've certainly had my share
of run-ins, in uniform and out.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.045
Then you'll know
how to talk to her.

13:05.088 --> 13:07.090
JESSE:
Can't do it blind.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.831
Gonna need to know more
about her first.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.833
I mean, is she a victim
or a suspect?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.661
Ah. And that is my cue.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.752
I have been zipping through
socials, search engines,

13:16.796 --> 13:19.711
public records to show you
all things Tracy Moore.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.018
Tracy's from Cleveland,
adopted at the age of six.

13:22.062 --> 13:23.803
Decent family.
Enlisted at 18.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.892
Hasn't looked back.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.634
That's it?

13:30.984 --> 13:33.725
I mean, I... I just
heard so many stories

13:33.769 --> 13:36.598
about how
you're NCIS's secret weapon.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.427
I am.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.865
Okay. And yet...

13:43.910 --> 13:46.738
I can only tell
you what exists.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.872
Like every detail
of Tracy's routine.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.918
Trains every morning
at a local pool.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.876
Swims the ocean
in the evening.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.965
Pays her bills on time.
Changes her oil early.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.706
Nothing from her past?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.577
From 18 to 25, she's
completely blank.

13:59.621 --> 14:00.970
No digital footprint.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.016
What about before 18?

14:03.059 --> 14:05.496
Glad someone's curious.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.543
I recovered this from,
of all things,

14:08.586 --> 14:10.632
a defunct Vine account.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.112
Only record
from this period.

14:12.155 --> 14:15.419
KAI:
That's Tracy in the middle.
Who are the dudes?

14:15.463 --> 14:16.768
Yeah, I'm still
working on IDing them.

14:16.812 --> 14:17.987
PIKE:
Oh, if you need help,

14:18.031 --> 14:19.902
my tech team's at your disposal.

14:19.946 --> 14:23.819
I do not need help,
and you're eating my yogurt.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.781
What do you see?

14:29.825 --> 14:31.914
American Renaissance Academy.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.438
Tracy trains there
in the morning.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.484
May be my way
to get her to open up.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.769
Ho! Ho!

15:00.812 --> 15:02.075
Members only, brah.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.077
Last I heard I was one.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.079
Kai Holman.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.167
[speaking Hawaiian]

15:07.210 --> 15:08.820
E ku'u 'ohana.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.953
How long you been back?Couple of months.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.650
Tell me why
I shouldn't be insulted.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.217
I've been busy.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.611
Hey, congrats on your dad.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.048
Congrats?Test results.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.832
Glad he's doing better.

15:22.878 --> 15:26.577
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
We're all relieved.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.057
So you here
to work out?

15:28.101 --> 15:30.581
'Cause I can tell you
ain't been in the water.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.714
Night diving off a cliff count?Ah.

15:32.757 --> 15:35.108
Come on.
That's just stupid, Kai.[laughs]

15:35.151 --> 15:36.587
I'm actually here for work.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.589
Hey, Petty Officer Moore,
you got a sec?

15:41.157 --> 15:42.985
She one of yours?

15:43.029 --> 15:45.509
Wish I could claim her,
but she's all her own.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.120
Mind if I go in?

15:47.163 --> 15:48.730
Membership's $50 a month.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.950
I'm good for it.You can go in, then.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.938
[water gurgling]

16:30.641 --> 16:33.731
You were impressive
down there.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.168
My mom was the real waterman.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.866
Taught me everything.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.825
How about you? There's not
a lot of watermen in Cleveland.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.219
Hmm. Guess not.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.830
Almost drowned
when I was a kid.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.224
Pure luck I survived.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.271
Vowed never
to be helpless again.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.926
Coast Guard Rescue
Swimmer is about as far

16:54.970 --> 16:56.624
from helpless
as you can get.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.234
Well, it's easy
to stay focused

16:58.278 --> 17:00.715
when someone else's life
is on the line.You know,

17:00.758 --> 17:02.369
focus can also be a distraction.

17:03.892 --> 17:07.809
I mean, your boyfriend was
murdered, but you're here.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.116
You see, some cops see you
here, they think about you

17:10.159 --> 17:12.727
avoiding our questions, they
think you're acting guilty.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.730
What do you think,
Special Agent?

17:15.773 --> 17:18.080
I think you're scared.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.777
I think you're hurting.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.389
You're hiding something
about David's murder.

17:27.394 --> 17:30.919
Eddie... Foreman.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.964
Guy I knew back home.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.010
He did this.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.056
Ex-boyfriend?

17:37.099 --> 17:39.101
If you could call it that.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.277
I didn't have much choice
in the matter.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.845
Why do you think
it's Eddie?

17:45.847 --> 17:49.329
When I was 16, Eddie took me
to a carnival for Sweetest Day.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.333
Spent his last dollar
trying to win me a teddy bear.

17:53.376 --> 17:56.075
Bean bag toss.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.077
He lost.

17:59.774 --> 18:02.298
But he was sure
the game was rigged.

18:02.342 --> 18:06.824
Beat the attendee
within an inch of his... life.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.262
It was ten years ago.Eddie was a bad guy.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.960
Ran with a crew,
pulled robberies.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.962
Sometimes he forced me to help.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.398
Help how?

18:15.442 --> 18:17.008
Be the lookout...

18:17.052 --> 18:18.923
or his alibi.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.665
But the last time...

18:21.709 --> 18:24.146
he did something,
and I just couldn't.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.756
What did he do, Tracy?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.107
He robbed a store.

18:28.150 --> 18:31.284
Set a fire so that
there would be no evidence.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.373
The building went up,

18:33.416 --> 18:37.725
and a couple was killed
in their apartment.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.205
And Eddie?

18:39.248 --> 18:40.989
I refused

18:41.032 --> 18:43.165
to be his alibi.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.080
He went to prison.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.127
And you think
Eddie blames you.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.826
The last thing
he texted me ten years ago.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.223
"You got away with murder."

18:59.399 --> 19:01.879
Recognize any of them?

19:03.098 --> 19:05.056
That's him.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.102
That's Eddie.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.847
Meet Eddie Foreman.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.110
Small-time crook
with big-time felony dreams.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.069
In and out of juvie until he
graduated to maximum security.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.376
Ten years for burning down
a corner store,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.378
killing a sleeping couple
on the second floor.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.119
Light sentence for murder.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.382
He pled down
to involuntary manslaughter.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.037
This happened seven years ago.
He should still be in prison.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.735
He was released early
on good behavior two weeks ago.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.911
Guess where he ended up.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.358
Eddie checked in five days ago.

19:45.401 --> 19:48.187
Geez, what happened?
He lose a bet?

19:48.230 --> 19:50.450
No. Kind of feel
like I did, though.

19:50.493 --> 19:53.627
What did I ever do
to tee you off, man?

19:53.670 --> 19:55.324
Oh, you mean aside
from stranding me

19:55.368 --> 19:56.804
in the middle of the Pacific?

19:56.847 --> 19:58.849
Stop it. That was
a miscommunication.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.634
Yeah, well, you're pushy,
you're opinionated,

20:00.677 --> 20:02.244
you don't play
well with others,

20:02.288 --> 20:03.593
but other than
that, you're aces.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.682
Well, good. I'm glad
we cleared that up.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.693
You want to go first?

20:16.737 --> 20:18.521
Do you mind?No.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.523
He might be armed.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.264
All right.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.267
Eddie Foreman,
federal agents.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.313
Gentlemen, come on in.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.445
Cup of coffee?
I just brewed some.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.926
It's from the, uh... it's from
the Honolulu Coffee Company.

20:31.969 --> 20:35.756
This is damn good.We need you to stand up, sir.

20:35.799 --> 20:38.889
Put your hands
behind your head, now.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.676
Did you know that, uh,
Hawai'i is the only U.S. state

20:42.719 --> 20:44.417
where coffee is
grown? [laughs]

20:46.288 --> 20:48.725
I was surprised, too.[clears throat]

20:48.769 --> 20:50.597
Okay, all right. [chuckles]

20:52.947 --> 20:55.254
What brings you
to Hawai'i, Eddie?

20:55.297 --> 20:58.822
What brings anyone
here? Paradise.

20:58.866 --> 21:01.303
Long way from
the Ohio State Penitentiary.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.000
Mm. I'm free now.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.742
Did you know you can
go anywhere you want?

21:05.786 --> 21:07.309
See whoever you want?

21:07.353 --> 21:09.442
Best thing about America.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.314
You want to know
what's un-American?

21:12.358 --> 21:13.315
What's that?

21:13.359 --> 21:15.448
Prison.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.928
No man should be able to do
to you what they do there.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.453
I like to think no crime
should go unpunished.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.932
Easy to say

21:21.976 --> 21:23.673
on that side of the cuffs.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.762
You followed her here,
didn't you?

21:25.806 --> 21:27.982
Gonna have to be more specific.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.897
Tracy Moore.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.595
Tracy?

21:32.639 --> 21:35.337
I haven't seen Tracy in...

21:35.381 --> 21:36.817
seven years?

21:38.471 --> 21:42.388
2,555 days if
I'm being precise.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.389
[chuckles]

21:43.432 --> 21:44.651
Is Tracy here?

21:44.694 --> 21:46.305
Where were you two nights ago?

21:46.348 --> 21:48.394
Something bad happen
two nights ago?

21:48.437 --> 21:49.612
Why would you think that?

21:49.656 --> 21:52.311
Well, I'm assuming
you didn't haul me in here

21:52.354 --> 21:53.616
because something good happened.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.531
Where were you?

21:55.575 --> 21:57.577
I was on a Hawaiian
boat tour.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.319
They call it a "booze cruise."

22:00.362 --> 22:01.885
What time was this tour?

22:01.929 --> 22:06.325
7:00 to 11:00 p.m., but
I got there early, and I, uh,

22:06.368 --> 22:08.805
bought a round of drinks
for a bachelorette party.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.808
You can ask the bartender.
He'll remember me.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.897
I'm a big tipper.
[clicks tongue]

22:13.941 --> 22:16.465
Two nights ago, Dave Andrews,

22:16.509 --> 22:18.946
Tracy's colleague, was
murdered in her home.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.035
Oh, yeah?

22:21.078 --> 22:23.472
TENNANT:
You don't sound surprised.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.477
I guess I'm not.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.001
I mean, to be honest, uh,

22:31.045 --> 22:34.875
trouble always seems
to follow Tracy.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.530
[laughs]

22:40.054 --> 22:42.012
How long has she been here?

22:42.056 --> 22:44.711
Came as soon as she heard
Eddie got picked up.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.626
You get a confession?JESSE:
No.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.062
But he's definitely guilty.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.977
Might be true,
but we got nothing on him.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.675
Alibi checks out,
forensics came back.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.548
Foreign DNA found
at Tracy's doesn't match Eddie.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.463
Someone else killed Andrews.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.465
Doesn't make sense. I mean,
it can't be a coincidence

22:59.508 --> 23:00.857
Eddie's on the island.

23:00.901 --> 23:03.033
What if Eddie had
an accomplice?

23:03.077 --> 23:05.122
According to court records
from Cleveland,

23:05.166 --> 23:08.517
Eddie had a knack for enlisting
people to do his bidding.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.780
Case after case, he managed
to convince younger people

23:10.824 --> 23:12.129
to follow his lead.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.740
JESSE:
Yeah, I saw it a lot

23:13.783 --> 23:15.959
as a street cop--
a charismatic predator

23:16.003 --> 23:17.700
taking advantage
of vulnerable kids.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.136
He did with Tracy, too.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.400
I'll have Ernie look
into his prison time,

23:21.443 --> 23:22.792
see if he made
friends inside.

23:22.836 --> 23:23.967
What do we do with Eddie?

23:24.011 --> 23:25.491
We let him go.

23:25.534 --> 23:26.883
But we keep
a close eye on him.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.721
You got him, right?We did.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.028
And he's going to jail?

23:42.072 --> 23:44.423
We don't have anything
to hold him.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.076
Oh...
Not yet at least.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.078
He's gonna get away with it.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.080
Again.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.604
And I have nowhere to go.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.780
You don't have to go, Tracy.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.913
We'll protect you,
and we will stop him.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.568
So many times.

23:59.612 --> 24:03.093
I let him get away with it
so many times.

24:03.137 --> 24:06.445
There was so much
I should have said or done.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.883
If I had, those people
would still be alive.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.885
And... Dave.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.930
You were a kid.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.932
Eddie was an adult.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.021
He used you.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.937
That's not what
it felt like.

24:20.981 --> 24:24.941
He made me feel like I was
the only girl in the world,

24:24.985 --> 24:27.509
like he was
the only guy who cared.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.206
Because that's what
a predator does.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.513
You were smart.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.515
You got away.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.997
No. I ran away
to the Coast Guard.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.479
All the way to Hawai'i,
and he still found me.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.785
All 'cause I had to be a hero.

24:42.829 --> 24:46.833
You are a hero, Tracy. You are.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.010
There'll be
no more running.

24:50.053 --> 24:54.144
We'll put you up,
protective custody.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.582
This will be okay.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.889
[whistling]

24:59.933 --> 25:01.500
Hey, stranger.
Hey.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.805
What are you up to?

25:02.849 --> 25:04.154
Mm, gonna take Tracy back

25:04.198 --> 25:05.678
to her place
to pick up some stuff.

25:05.721 --> 25:09.116
Mm. Are we gonna continue
this cat and mouse game?

25:11.031 --> 25:13.773
Starts with a "W,"
ends with a "ler."

25:14.817 --> 25:17.167
Fine. Three questions. Go.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.604
You're seeing her?Yes.

25:18.647 --> 25:19.648
How long?This time?

25:19.692 --> 25:20.954
There are other times?

25:20.997 --> 25:21.998
And those are
your three questions.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.260
Thank you for playing.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.175
Hey, you didn't answer
the second one.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.049
It's been a few weeks,
on and off.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.180
Mostly off.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.660
And always frustrating.

25:31.704 --> 25:32.922
Why frustrating?

25:32.966 --> 25:34.184
She wants everything on the DL.

25:34.228 --> 25:37.274
[scoffs] And that's a problem?Yes.

25:37.318 --> 25:40.800
We're both adults,
not breaking any rules.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.802
And she'll-she'll barely
look at me here.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.847
She's embarrassed by me.

25:44.891 --> 25:47.763
Maybe she's embarrassed
by herself.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.592
Well, that's silly.Did you ask her?

25:50.636 --> 25:53.639
Uh... No, but...

25:53.682 --> 25:56.685
Maybe you should, since
you're both adults and all.

25:56.729 --> 26:00.602
You're the last person
I should be taking advice from.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.083
Your dating life's a series
of train wrecks.[device chimes]

26:03.126 --> 26:05.564
Oh. Sorry. Duty calls.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.700
Hey. Hey.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.789
I think
I got something for you.

26:15.138 --> 26:18.054
What am I looking at?Well, I figured out that

26:18.098 --> 26:20.883
all these guys ran in Eddie's
robbery crew back in Cleveland.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.102
Any of them still around?

26:22.145 --> 26:23.669
Louis Grayson.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.061
He was involved
in the store fire.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.890
Refused to flip on Eddie,
served hard time for it.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.588
At the Ohio State Penitentiary?

26:29.631 --> 26:31.067
Yup, same cellblock.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.592
And according to the deputy
warden, they stayed close.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.202
Louis went on parole
last year.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.638
Where is he now?

26:36.682 --> 26:39.075
He didn't check in
with his PO last week, so...

26:39.119 --> 26:41.121
no one knows.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.909
KAI:
Look at him go to town.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.172
Not a care in the world.
Do you think he's made us?

26:49.216 --> 26:50.826
Yeah, he's definitely made us.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.741
Yeah, the least
he could do is

26:52.785 --> 26:54.743
send over some leftovers.
I'm starving.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.745
Got some poke here
in the back.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.355
Happy to go halfsies.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.879
JESSE:
Yeah, we're good.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.228
Thanks, though.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.274
Unbelievable.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.276
What gives?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.278
It's my dad.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.237
Had some medical tests.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.109
Oh. Everything okay?

27:13.153 --> 27:16.635
Yeah. Yeah, he's doing well.

27:16.678 --> 27:17.984
That's good news.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.377
Only he never told me
about any of these tests.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.815
I... I came here
to take care of him,

27:22.858 --> 27:26.035
and I'm out of the loop.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.778
That's the most you've talked
about your personal life

27:29.822 --> 27:31.693
since you joined the team.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.303
Yeah, but we don't...
we don't really get personal.

27:33.347 --> 27:35.349
Nah, bro, you don't
get personal.

27:35.392 --> 27:39.135
I've told you about my wife's
obsessive party planning,

27:39.179 --> 27:42.182
my kid's learning difficulties,

27:42.225 --> 27:44.010
my sister's divorce.

27:44.053 --> 27:47.013
I mean, I didn't even
know you hada father.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.015
Now you know.
[chuckles]

27:51.017 --> 27:53.062
JESSE:
My dad was a piece of work.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.370
He was an engineer, you know?

27:57.893 --> 28:00.330
Uh, but when he got old,
he started

28:00.374 --> 28:02.071
calling me out of the blue.

28:02.115 --> 28:05.379
He'd be like,
the TV remote was broken,

28:05.422 --> 28:08.382
or coffee machine, garage door.

28:08.425 --> 28:11.080
Right. He would get you
to fix it. Okay.

28:11.124 --> 28:14.170
Yeah, and then, one
time, I came early,

28:14.214 --> 28:16.912
and I walked in on him.
He was messing with the TV.

28:16.956 --> 28:19.698
And I knew in that moment he
didn't actually need my help.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.744
He just wanted you to come over.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.485
Yeah.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.881
So I did.

28:28.924 --> 28:33.929
You know, every time
he'd call, for two years

28:33.973 --> 28:35.975
until he died.

28:42.242 --> 28:44.244
What about your dad?

28:48.117 --> 28:50.119
Owns a restaurant.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.734
That's it?

28:55.777 --> 28:59.868
I give you this sweet,
anecdotal story about my dad,

28:59.912 --> 29:02.392
and all you got is,
"Owns a restaurant"?

29:02.436 --> 29:04.220
PIKE:
My dad was a painter.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.266
Hey, Pike, private convo.Guys?

29:06.309 --> 29:07.963
You guys have been on comms
this whole time.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.748
Hello?
How am I supposed to know?

29:09.791 --> 29:12.054
Guys, Eddie's on the move.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.364
Just grab a couple days
of clean clothes.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.369
Um...

29:23.457 --> 29:25.938
You can wait
by the door.

29:38.428 --> 29:40.430
[indistinct chatter]

29:47.829 --> 29:49.788
Check the restrooms.

29:50.919 --> 29:53.139
No sign of Eddie anywhere.

29:59.362 --> 30:02.322
Pike, Eddie fled out
the kitchen exit. [sighs]

30:04.324 --> 30:06.326
Hey.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.113
Uh, all right.

30:11.157 --> 30:13.028
Pike, where the
hell are you?

30:13.072 --> 30:14.464
Doing my job.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.510
I got eyes on Eddie.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.954
[creaks]

30:27.042 --> 30:28.827
Hit the floor now!
[gasps]

30:28.870 --> 30:30.350
TENNANT:Federal agent!Drop it!

30:31.394 --> 30:32.526
[body thuds]

30:41.927 --> 30:43.885
[panting]

30:53.721 --> 30:56.158
Name's Louis Grayson.
Ring a bell?

30:56.202 --> 30:58.073
Yeah.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.988
From the old days.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.208
He-he used to pull jobs
with Eddie.

31:02.251 --> 31:03.687
They served time together.

31:03.731 --> 31:06.952
And it looks like Eddie
convinced him to come after you.

31:06.995 --> 31:09.737
You see? You see how he does?
How he bends everyone to him?

31:09.780 --> 31:12.305
Not anymore. We're tracking him.

31:12.348 --> 31:13.741
And we know he was
behind all this.

31:13.784 --> 31:17.179
You keep telling me that, but...

31:17.223 --> 31:20.226
Why don't you get Tracy
out of here, huh?[phone buzzing]

31:20.269 --> 31:22.228
I'm gonna wrap this up.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.016
Eddie tooled around for
about a half an hour,

31:28.060 --> 31:29.365
went back to his room.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.150
Pike's watching
the hotel now.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.152
We know where Eddie is.
How do we take him down?

31:33.195 --> 31:35.241
Uh, DNA came back from
the Andrews murder.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.677
Matches Louis Grayson.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.723
I dumped Louis's phone.
Lots of texts with Eddie.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.464
Plus these.

31:41.508 --> 31:43.771
TENNANT:
He was stalking her.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.164
And sending the
photos to Eddie.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.992
While we've been sitting
on Eddie...

31:47.035 --> 31:48.341
He's been
sitting on Tracy.

31:48.384 --> 31:50.430
But can we prove it?

31:50.473 --> 31:53.215
HPD found ten grand cash
in Louis's hotel room.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.000
Eddie emptied
his bank account

31:55.043 --> 31:56.653
of about double that
before he flew here.

31:56.697 --> 31:59.352
Put that with the texts, and the
history between these guys...

31:59.395 --> 32:01.354
It's enough
to bring Eddie back in.

32:01.397 --> 32:03.225
Let Pike know
you're on your way.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.663
Eddie drains his bank account,

32:06.707 --> 32:08.448
has his buddy skip parole,

32:08.491 --> 32:10.276
comes to an island in
the middle of the ocean

32:10.319 --> 32:12.017
just to get to Tracy.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.062
You're wondering
what his exit plan is.

32:15.237 --> 32:17.239
I'm realizing he
doesn't have one.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.764
LUCY:
I know we've got eyes on Eddie,

32:20.808 --> 32:22.766
but we should go back
to the safe house.

32:22.810 --> 32:25.117
TRACY:
I know. I just...

32:25.160 --> 32:28.381
I-I can't be caged like that.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.383
I felt like I was gonna explode.

32:30.426 --> 32:33.777
I just...
I just need to breathe.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.651
This is peaceful to you, huh?

32:37.694 --> 32:41.220
Only place I feel like myself.

32:41.263 --> 32:44.658
Yeah, raging waters,
bottomless depths.

32:44.701 --> 32:47.095
You don't like the water?Let's just say,

32:47.139 --> 32:49.228
the water and I don't jibe.

32:49.271 --> 32:52.144
I barely made it through
my water training at FLETC.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.233
Well, that's just because
you weren't trained right.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.235
I could show you
some tricks.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.498
I can say
without hesitation

32:58.541 --> 33:01.501
that's one offer
I won't be taking you up on.

33:18.431 --> 33:21.129
Where the hell is he?

33:25.307 --> 33:27.440
KAI:
Calling it in.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.311
Damn it, Pike.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.271
[phone ringing]

33:32.314 --> 33:34.273
What's up, boss?

33:34.316 --> 33:37.493
Eddie's out of pocket. You need
to get Tracy out of there now.

33:37.537 --> 33:40.148
On it. Tracy,
we got to go now.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.629
I'm sending backup units.
Take her to the safe house.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.500
[siren whoops]

33:46.459 --> 33:48.461
They're already here.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.158
Not possible, Lucy.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.858
Don't!

34:00.168 --> 34:01.648
Where's Special
Agent Pike?

34:01.691 --> 34:04.781
Oh, he's in the car.
Breathing. For now.

34:04.825 --> 34:05.956
Good. He's still alive.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.480
No one else has to get hurt.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.091
Well, that depends
if you listen.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.093
I'm only here for her.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.573
It's not happening.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.575
What? You're gonna take a bullet
for this girl?

34:15.618 --> 34:17.142
Honestly, she's not worth it.

34:17.185 --> 34:19.013
Put the gun down.
You can tell me why.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.928
Two people died
because of her.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.669
You started that fire, Eddie.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.715
You always got somebody else
to blame, don't you, Tracy?

34:25.759 --> 34:27.021
You couldn't do a simple job.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.631
TRACY:
You forced me to help you.

34:28.675 --> 34:31.504
You have free will
like everyone else.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.681
You made your choice,
and I paid the price for it.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.031
A third of my life.LUCY:
Gonna be a lot longer

34:37.075 --> 34:38.685
if you try to hurt Tracy.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.644
[laughs]
I'm not going back to prison.

34:41.688 --> 34:42.689
How do you figure?

34:42.732 --> 34:43.907
We're done talking.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.779
[yelling]Jump in the water!

34:49.087 --> 34:51.828
[both yelling, grunting]

34:54.048 --> 34:56.181
Go! Go!

34:58.096 --> 35:00.054
[grunting]

35:09.324 --> 35:11.587
[grunting loudly]

35:21.641 --> 35:23.686
Stay where you are!

35:23.730 --> 35:25.253
I'm not going in alive.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.212
[panting]

35:27.255 --> 35:29.257
Not your choice.
Hands on your head.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.785
You okay?Yeah.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.135
Yeah. Thank you.All right.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.272
Tracy!

35:44.316 --> 35:46.709
You can come back now.
You're safe.

35:46.753 --> 35:47.710
[exhales]

35:47.754 --> 35:50.060
[groaning]

35:50.104 --> 35:52.933
You gonna give me a hard time?

35:52.976 --> 35:55.283
Nah. I'm gonna give you a hand.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.155
[grunts]

35:59.069 --> 36:01.028
I'll wait to give you a hard
time until you stop bleeding.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.812
[laughs] Ow.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.858
[groans]

36:16.130 --> 36:18.828
Ah, there he is.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.265
Man of the hour.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.223
I just got off the phone
with your SAC

36:22.267 --> 36:24.617
and thanked him for sharing
his best agent with us.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.358
Thanks, Tennant.
I appreciate that.

36:26.401 --> 36:30.275
Listen, dude, I know
I give you a hard time, but

36:30.318 --> 36:33.016
it means a lot to us,
you having Lucy's back.

36:33.060 --> 36:38.152
I would be beaming right now if
it didn't hurt so much to smile.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.762
[laughter]

36:39.806 --> 36:41.938
Pike, seriously, thank you, bro.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.855
Hey, I'm taking Jesse out
to dinner if you want to join.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.162
Oh, I can't.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.121
Pain pills just kicked in.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.820
But any other night, though,
and I mean that.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.387
Any... other... night.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.302
Baby steps, Pike.PIKE: Yeah.

36:57.345 --> 36:59.086
Baby steps.Come on, Neil.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.088
I'll drive you home.All right.

37:01.131 --> 37:03.960
[chuckles][sighs]

37:04.004 --> 37:05.658
Where are you taking me?

37:05.701 --> 37:07.877
Local joint.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.890
Thank you.

37:20.934 --> 37:25.112
You're... gonna tell me
I look awful.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.157
No.[laughs]

37:29.247 --> 37:32.946
Well, did I forget another
tennis bracelet or something?

37:32.989 --> 37:35.122
No.

37:36.166 --> 37:39.692
Okay, well, I'm gonna limp
back to my desk now.

37:39.735 --> 37:42.216
I'm... I'm sorry.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.962
I got hit in the head today, so
I'm not sure I heard you right.

37:49.005 --> 37:52.226
I'm sorry, Lucy.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.880
You were right.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.186
I-I had a bad phone call
and took it out on you

37:56.230 --> 37:58.711
and hurt your feelings.

37:58.754 --> 38:01.931
That is the last thing
that I want to do.

38:01.975 --> 38:05.500
You're...
you're embarrassed by me.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.417
No.

38:10.940 --> 38:14.770
No. I'm-I'm embarrassed by me.

38:15.902 --> 38:18.339
Look, I am trying
to do this your way,

38:18.383 --> 38:19.906
be, you know, all

38:19.949 --> 38:21.342
expressive and smiley.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.824
It's just, it's-it's hard
for me to be...

38:24.867 --> 38:26.782
Human?

38:27.783 --> 38:30.917
I'm trying here, Lucy.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.792
I know you are.

38:38.490 --> 38:41.754
And, uh, if you want
to keep this between us,

38:41.797 --> 38:44.017
I can be good with that.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.237
You can?

38:47.281 --> 38:49.936
You want this
to be compartmented,

38:49.979 --> 38:52.765
so that's how it'll be.

38:52.808 --> 38:55.202
Our secret.

38:55.245 --> 38:59.989
And, uh, secrets can be fun.

39:05.865 --> 39:09.085
Do you want to tell me
more about the fun part?

39:13.481 --> 39:15.309
What is this place?

39:15.353 --> 39:18.051
Just a little slice of home.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.140
Kai.

39:20.183 --> 39:22.185
I never expect you.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.057
Wanted to grab
a bite, but

39:24.100 --> 39:25.841
maybe you can't fit us in.

39:25.885 --> 39:28.366
Shame on me if I cannot
make room for my 'ohana.

39:29.889 --> 39:32.457
Mr. Holman,
it's a real pleasure.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.807
Pleasure's mine.
You work with Kai?Yeah, Dad.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.330
This is Jesse.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.201
I'm sure
he's told you all about me.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.552
Yeah, that's my son.
Never stops talking about work.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.075
Yeah, he won't

39:42.118 --> 39:43.816
shut up about his family,
either.

39:43.859 --> 39:45.992
[laughs]
I like this one.All right, all right.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.036
You think we can sit?

39:47.080 --> 39:51.301
Yeah, come. Sit. Stay.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.436
Thank you. [sighs]

39:55.480 --> 39:57.569
Grab another chair.No, no, Dad.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.179
Dad, you don't have to...

39:59.222 --> 40:00.485
Oh, come on.
Let the man sit.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.574
I'm sure he's got
some interesting stories

40:02.617 --> 40:04.053
about little Kai.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.056
Maybe one or two.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.189
[laughs]

40:09.232 --> 40:11.409
Kai told me about your
medical tests going well.

40:11.452 --> 40:14.324
Congratulations.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.588
Yeah, Pop.
Congratulations on that.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.636
I say something... I said
something wrong, didn't I?

40:28.077 --> 40:30.079
No.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.561
No. Let's celebrate, yeah?

40:35.258 --> 40:37.217
Congratulations, Dad.
