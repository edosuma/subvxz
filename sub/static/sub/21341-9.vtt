Boo!

01:33.594 --> 01:35.463
[yelp]
How did you know?

01:35.496 --> 01:38.532
You try to scare me every time
we come to the aquarium.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.234
And one day it'll work.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.238
Whoa, look at that one.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.806
[Dana]
She's huge!

01:45.839 --> 01:48.776
I wouldn't want to swim
with one of those.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.644
[Sara]
Me neither.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.647
[Dana] I wonder what
kind of shark it is.

01:53.681 --> 01:54.682
That's a sand tiger shark.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.617
How do you know its name?

01:56.650 --> 01:59.653
The audio guide told me that it
can grow bigger than two of me.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.456
That's big,
but it's not the biggest shark.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.458
No, the biggest
is the whale shark.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.427
It can grow as long
as eight of me.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.828
[buzzer noise]

02:07.861 --> 02:11.499
The biggest shark of all time
was the Megalodon.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.900
It was also the most scary.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.568
The Megalodon?

02:14.602 --> 02:15.936
It's a prehistoric shark

02:15.969 --> 02:17.738
that lived after
the dinosaurs went extinct.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.273
So how big was it?

02:19.307 --> 02:20.874
Paleontologists
don't know for sure

02:20.908 --> 02:23.444
'cause the only bones they
can find were its teeth,

02:23.477 --> 02:25.713
which were like
the size of my hand.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.715
[growl]

02:27.748 --> 02:29.717
So how will we ever
know how big it was?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.519
Well...

02:31.552 --> 02:34.922
The best way would be to go
back in time in a submarine.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.890
[chuckle]
Wouldn't that be cool?

02:38.492 --> 02:39.827
Yes, it would.

[***]

No sign of the Megalodon...

02:56.310 --> 02:58.279
yet.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.948
Any luck on the sound scanner,
Commander Sara?

03:00.981 --> 03:02.616
[Sara]
Activating sound scanner.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.819
Scanning for any noises
outside the sub.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.389
Nothing on the sound scanner,
Captain Dana.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.990
Increase speed
to "faster."

03:10.023 --> 03:12.693
She's gotta be
out there,

03:12.726 --> 03:14.495
somewhere.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.230
Aye aye, Captain.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.665
Increasing speed to "faster."

03:17.698 --> 03:20.368
[engine charging]

03:20.401 --> 03:22.336
Where are you hiding,
Megalodon?

03:24.037 --> 03:27.908
[***]

03:32.045 --> 03:35.983
[***]

03:38.018 --> 03:42.990
[beeping]

03:43.023 --> 03:44.592
Contact!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.694
Our Megalodon hunt
was a success.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.728
Yes!

03:47.761 --> 03:49.730
Now to see
how big she is.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.333
We're gonna need to
get right up beside her.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.801
How will that
show her size?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.736
This submarine is
the size of a bus.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.805
If we can get the Megalodon
right beside us,

03:57.838 --> 04:00.341
we can guess her size
compared to our sub.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.009
Huh.
Smart thinking, Captain.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.544
Thank you,
Commander.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.846
[beeping]
[Sara gasps]

04:06.914 --> 04:08.549
She's almost on us!

04:12.486 --> 04:13.854
[Dana]
Almost on us?

04:13.887 --> 04:15.723
I don't see her,
Commander Sara.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.591
[Sara]
She should be right there.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.259
[Dana screams]

04:20.328 --> 04:24.598
[***]

04:30.504 --> 04:32.440
We're gonna need
a bigger sub.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.944
Why would we need
a bigger submarine?

04:36.977 --> 04:39.380
If she's the same
size as our sub,

04:39.413 --> 04:43.050
that would make her the largest
water predator of all time...

04:43.083 --> 04:45.519
Of... all... time.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.687
Whoa.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.856
Yeah, "whoa."
Big-time "whoa."

04:48.889 --> 04:52.526
The Megalodon isn't like these
cute little sharks, seester.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.428
These ones are
called bamboo sharks

04:54.462 --> 04:56.864
because their color kind of
looks like bamboo sticks.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.399
[Sara]
Oh.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.868
But Megalodon's name
literally means

05:00.901 --> 05:02.770
"mega" for "big"
and "-odon" for "tooth."

05:03.837 --> 05:04.872
"Big tooth?"

05:04.905 --> 05:06.840
Big tooth...

05:06.874 --> 05:08.642
little sub.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.079
Ooh, seems like the Megalodon
is hunting us now!

05:12.112 --> 05:13.747
The audio guide said

05:13.781 --> 05:16.684
big sharks usually capture
their food from below

05:16.717 --> 05:18.085
so they can surprise them.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.722
Think, Dana, think...

05:21.755 --> 05:24.892
[gasp] These bamboo sharks are
also called "carpet sharks"

05:24.925 --> 05:27.361
because they live at
the bottom of the ocean,

05:27.395 --> 05:30.130
where it's safer because they
can see everything above them.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.500
That means all we have to do

05:32.533 --> 05:34.735
is get our sub lower
than the Megalodon

05:34.768 --> 05:37.137
so it can't surprise us!

05:37.170 --> 05:38.972
Good plan, Captain.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.673
We've been hit
by the Megalodon!

06:12.706 --> 06:13.874
What's the damage?

06:13.907 --> 06:17.478
[alarms blaring,
instruments beeping]

06:17.511 --> 06:19.112
[Sara]
Everything's broken.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.615
But at least we're safe
inside the sub.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.924

06:32.192 --> 06:35.663

06:36.997 --> 06:39.132

Dana!

06:39.166 --> 06:40.834
We're not safe
inside the sub.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.803
Paleontologists think
that the Megalodon

06:42.836 --> 06:46.840
had the strongest bite force of
any animal that ever existed.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.743
Bite force?
Is that how strong it can bite?

06:49.777 --> 06:50.978
Exactly.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.613
[both growl]

06:52.646 --> 06:53.947
Hm...

06:53.981 --> 06:56.116
Do they know how strong
its bite force was?

06:56.149 --> 06:58.452
They think it was
enough to crush a car!

06:58.486 --> 06:59.853
[chuckle]

06:59.887 --> 07:02.122
But isn't the metal
on a submarine

07:02.155 --> 07:04.057
a LOT stronger
than on a car?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.759
Good point.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.562
But it's more exciting
if it could bite through.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.198
[chuckle] I agree.
Back to screaming?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.635

Argh!

07:27.681 --> 07:29.249
What do we do, Captain?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.785
Our only hope is to
outrun the Megalodon.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.088
Quick,
go to the engine room,

07:35.122 --> 07:37.691
fix the engines,
and set our speed to "fastest."

07:37.725 --> 07:39.727
I'll stay here and
try to dodge her.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.094
Aye aye, Captain.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.232
Commander...

07:45.265 --> 07:46.934
Yes, Captain?

07:48.001 --> 07:50.103
Good luck.
You too.

Oh.

[chuckle]

09:49.056 --> 09:51.759
I'm just glad the Megalodon
isn't around anymore.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.127
I'm not so sure...

09:55.262 --> 09:56.664
Dana, there's nothing--

09:56.697 --> 09:58.699
Megalodon!!
Ha-ha.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.034
Got you, finally.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.737
N-No, you didn't.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.138
I was just...

10:05.172 --> 10:06.373
pretending to be scared.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.810
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Whatever.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.145
People who pretend to be
scared look like this:

10:12.179 --> 10:13.847
[mocking whine]

10:13.881 --> 10:15.348
I did not look like that.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.885
Yes you did.
You can't see your own face.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.352

Who says I can't?

Dana, where have you been?

I've been trying to solve
dino experiment 510:

11:37.297 --> 11:40.067
How did the Microraptor
protect itself from predators?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.869
"Microraptor."
Which one is that again?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.772
It's one of the smallest
dinosaurs ever discovered.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.274
It was only like this big.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.276
Well, we're gonna feel this big

11:49.309 --> 11:51.912
if we're late to Coach Powers'
after-school gym program.

11:51.945 --> 11:52.880
C'mon.

What... is...

12:03.423 --> 12:06.794
dodge... ball?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.929
A fun game where you
try to dodge balls,

or you're out.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.866

"A fun game?"

12:12.900 --> 12:15.202
Do you think a fight
for survival is fun?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.805
It depends.
Are dinosaurs involved?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.039
What?

12:19.072 --> 12:21.308
Just say "no."
No?

Didn't think so.

Ahem.
This ball must be flat.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.582
And Riley,
I'll call your team the...

13:36.649 --> 13:39.052
...Purring Kitties.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.620
Alright, everybody,

13:40.653 --> 13:43.390
grab a ball and let's see
who will survive!

13:43.423 --> 13:45.258
Remember, no throwing
in the face, though.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.999
Hey, seester,

13:52.032 --> 13:54.334
why didn't you choose
me for your team?

13:54.367 --> 13:58.138
I would have, but Coach Powers
said "only the strongest win,"

13:58.171 --> 14:00.941
and you're the smallest
kid here, and I...

14:00.974 --> 14:02.342
I like to win!

14:02.375 --> 14:03.911
[chuckle]

14:07.380 --> 14:09.449
I like to win, too...

14:09.482 --> 14:12.319
Sorry, just checking to make
sure this thing still works.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.087
Alright, teams,

14:14.121 --> 14:16.456
let's line up
and let's do this!

14:16.489 --> 14:18.058
[students cheer]

14:18.091 --> 14:19.392
Microraptor!

14:22.629 --> 14:24.397
Hi, Microraptor.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.565
[squawk]

14:25.598 --> 14:27.067
What?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.069
I can't hear you
through the glass.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.403
[tapping]

14:30.437 --> 14:32.906
[squeak]

14:32.940 --> 14:34.207
[growling and hissing]

14:36.043 --> 14:39.112
[growling and hissing]

14:39.146 --> 14:41.081
An Ozraptor!

14:43.984 --> 14:47.554
Now's my chance to finish
dino experiment 510:

14:47.587 --> 14:51.658
How did the Microraptor
protect itself from predators?

14:51.691 --> 14:54.327
[snarl, hiss]

14:56.096 --> 14:59.132
...But only if you know
there's a predator.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.469
Microraptor,
look behind you!

15:03.536 --> 15:04.537
[squeak]

15:04.571 --> 15:06.539
Be-hind you...

15:06.573 --> 15:08.208
Big teeth...

15:08.241 --> 15:10.643
Chomp chomp,
you.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.947
[squeaking]

15:13.981 --> 15:16.116
[snarling]

15:16.149 --> 15:19.419
[Ozraptor growling,
Microraptor squeaking]

15:28.028 --> 15:30.330
The Microraptor
uses its fast feet

15:30.363 --> 15:32.065
to escape from predators.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.601
[Ozraptor growling,
Microraptor squeaking]

15:37.537 --> 15:39.206
But you can't run forever,

15:39.239 --> 15:41.141
especially from a predator
that is larger

15:41.174 --> 15:43.210
and has more
energy than you.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.547
Why are you heading
back here, Microraptor?

15:47.580 --> 15:49.316
You can't break through
the glass.

15:49.349 --> 15:53.686
[Ozraptor growling,
Microraptor squeaking]

15:54.754 --> 15:56.189
Sorry, buddy.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.425
I guess bigger isn't
always better.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.393
[coach]
Take your sides, people!

16:02.162 --> 16:03.730
[hiss]

16:04.797 --> 16:06.633
Rules are simple...

16:06.666 --> 16:08.235
I blow the whistle,

16:08.268 --> 16:10.170
you run to the center,
grab a ball,

16:10.203 --> 16:12.339
and try to tag
the other team with it.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.142
If you're tagged,
you're out, sit down.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.610
Last team standing wins.
Understood?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.146
[students]
Yeah!

16:19.179 --> 16:21.348
Get back,
get back, get back...

16:21.381 --> 16:22.349
Okay.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.319
[***]

16:27.420 --> 16:29.989
[whistle]
Go, go, go, go!

16:34.494 --> 16:36.096
Ooh!
Rainy's out!

16:37.164 --> 16:38.265
Curtis is out!

16:39.332 --> 16:40.467
Riley, you're out!

16:41.734 --> 16:43.036
Oh, ouch!

16:43.070 --> 16:44.704
[laugh]

16:44.737 --> 16:48.441
The Fighting Tigers completely
wipe out the Purring Kitties.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.410
I guess size
does matter.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.379
[laugh]
C'mon!

16:52.412 --> 16:54.747
Yes, it does.
Rematch!

16:56.249 --> 16:58.418
What are you talking
about, Dana?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.087
We just got
destroyed out there!

17:00.120 --> 17:01.754
They're way too big for us.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.291
A lot of people think that
all dinosaurs were huge,

17:04.324 --> 17:06.159
but they weren't.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.660
There were some
really small ones

17:07.694 --> 17:09.362
that figured out
ways to survive.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.298
How is this helpful?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.600
Because size does matter...

17:13.633 --> 17:15.768
Especially when you're small.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.171
Bigger isn't always better.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.473
All the big dinosaurs
became extinct.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.175
Do you know
who survived?

17:22.209 --> 17:24.177
The little ones?
Exactly.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.380
And they did it by being faster
and smarter than the big ones,

17:27.414 --> 17:30.250
and that's just what
we're going to do.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.119
We're gonna be...
Faster!

17:32.152 --> 17:34.454
And...?
Smarter!

17:34.487 --> 17:37.157
Sorry.
I love rousing speeches.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.460
Are we doing this or what?

17:40.493 --> 17:42.562
Oh, we're doing this...

17:42.595 --> 17:44.297
Microraptor style.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.633
[roar]

17:46.666 --> 17:48.801
C'mon, Microraptors!

17:48.835 --> 17:50.403
[whispering]
Here's the plan.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.173
Microraptors are one of

17:53.206 --> 17:55.142
the smallest dinosaurs
ever discovered.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.344
They're also
one of the fastest.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.712
They use their fast speed
to escape from predators.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.349
That means we can
use our fast speed

18:02.382 --> 18:04.817
to get the dodgeballs
before Sara's team.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.286
Then what?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.421
Then we take
them out one by one.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.424
Ready?
Ready.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.562
[team]
Go, Microraptors!

18:15.595 --> 18:17.330
[coach]
Alright,

18:17.364 --> 18:21.134
it's the final match between
the Fighting Tigers

18:21.168 --> 18:22.735
and the...

18:22.769 --> 18:25.805
[team]
Microraptors!

18:25.838 --> 18:28.841
Oh yeah.
That seems to suit you better.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.778
Don't know what it means,
but here we go!

18:34.547 --> 18:35.715
Remember the plan.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.386
[whistle]
Go, go, go!

18:42.322 --> 18:44.157
Ooh!
Ila, you're out.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.392
Great job,
Microraptors.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.794
Tamara, you're out!

18:47.827 --> 18:50.397
That's four to two
for the Microraptors.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.800
Double hit!

18:53.833 --> 18:55.768
Curtis, Rainy,
you're out!

18:55.802 --> 18:57.637
The game's tied up.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.606
Everyone,
grab a ball.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.710
Let's go, let's go!
Let's hustle!

19:05.412 --> 19:07.647
There's nowhere to run now.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.183
[Microraptor squawking]

19:12.752 --> 19:16.389
[Ozraptor hissing,
Microraptors squeaking]

19:25.298 --> 19:27.700
[Dana] It's not just
about being fast...

19:27.734 --> 19:29.336
It's about teamwork!

19:29.369 --> 19:31.738
Riley, smaller dinosaurs
had to work together

19:31.771 --> 19:33.440
to fight off bigger ones!

19:33.473 --> 19:35.408
Work together, huh?

19:35.442 --> 19:37.377
Let's do this.

19:38.445 --> 19:42.315
[***]

19:46.853 --> 19:51.324
[***]

19:56.829 --> 19:58.765
I don't believe it...

20:01.934 --> 20:04.437
The Microraptors win it!

20:05.505 --> 20:06.973
Nice teamwork.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.708
Great job, Microraptors.
We did it!

20:12.979 --> 20:15.315
[sigh]
Good game, little seester.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.583
Good game,
big seester.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.485
Another rematch?
Sure.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.987
But this time,
I'm gonna be on your team.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.655
That move was awesome.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.523
I know.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.495
And that's what we
call sportsmanship.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.962
Let's play again!

20:31.564 --> 20:34.667
[Microraptors squawking]

20:38.037 --> 20:41.007
[squeak]

20:41.040 --> 20:43.976
