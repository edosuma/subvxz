00:00.230 --> 00:02.058
Previously on Royal Pains...

00:02.058 --> 00:03.959
How much longer will the E.R. be closed?

00:04.027 --> 00:05.627
A week, a month, all summer?

00:05.695 --> 00:08.096
A company called Symphony's
negotiating to buy the hospital,

00:08.164 --> 00:09.898
but the regulatory
approval's taking forever.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.967
I'm taking a sabbatical from
Sutton and Chesterfield.

00:12.035 --> 00:12.968
What?

00:13.036 --> 00:14.269
Why?

00:14.337 --> 00:17.072
To do some private work for a major client.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.440
Jeremiah, how would you feel

00:18.508 --> 00:22.878
about continuing to be
Hankmed's medical director?

00:22.946 --> 00:25.080
Why do anything for me?

00:25.148 --> 00:26.582
Because we're your family.

00:26.649 --> 00:29.351
Everything worked out great.

00:29.419 --> 00:31.487
You must be so relieved.

00:31.554 --> 00:33.188
I paid her.

00:33.256 --> 00:34.757
What?

00:34.824 --> 00:36.058
So is she staying because of us,

00:36.126 --> 00:38.961
or is she staying because of the money?

00:49.539 --> 00:50.606
Hey.

00:50.673 --> 00:51.740
Oh, hey.

00:51.808 --> 00:53.008
You're up early.

00:53.076 --> 00:55.944
Yeah, I thought I would make us breakfast.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.914
You know, sausage and bacon
and biscuits and gravy,

00:58.982 --> 01:01.383
the perfect pre-cardio meal.

01:01.451 --> 01:03.652
You know what, I will just
keep this warm for you.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.087
Oh, no, no, no. You know what?

01:05.155 --> 01:06.989
I'll have a bite while it's still hot.

01:07.056 --> 01:08.524
- Oh.
- Smells amazing.

01:08.591 --> 01:10.868
[Chuckles]

01:13.263 --> 01:15.798
Mmm.

01:15.865 --> 01:18.467
Oh, my God, it is amazing. [Laughs]

01:18.535 --> 01:20.102
Did your mom teach you how to cook?

01:20.170 --> 01:21.270
Oh, my mom? No.

01:21.337 --> 01:23.138
Oh, my gosh, she was too busy working.

01:23.206 --> 01:25.974
I learned from the cooks at
the restaurant where I worked.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.109
I learned everything from them.

01:27.177 --> 01:28.477
- Ah.
- Don't feel bad.

01:28.545 --> 01:30.145
They were excellent teachers.

01:30.213 --> 01:33.949
And you know, the four of them
really took me under their wing.

01:34.017 --> 01:36.051
They became my surrogate family.

01:36.119 --> 01:39.555
Yeah, but still, you took
on a lot of responsibility,

01:39.622 --> 01:42.257
and I know that wasn't easy.

01:42.325 --> 01:45.594
See, I was the fill-in
for Eddie and for my mom,

01:45.662 --> 01:47.963
and it was tough, a lot of work.

01:48.031 --> 01:49.498
It's probably why Evan
became such a good cook.

01:49.566 --> 01:50.599
If he wanted a great meal,

01:50.667 --> 01:51.900
he knew he wasn't getting it from me.

01:51.968 --> 01:53.569
[Both chuckle]

01:53.636 --> 01:55.537
Yeah, I mean, I never minded the work.

01:55.605 --> 01:56.805
In fact, I think the reason why

01:56.873 --> 01:59.641
I worked at the diner so much was because...

01:59.709 --> 02:02.845
Well, it was better than being alone.

02:02.912 --> 02:04.646
But I mean, I'm sure someone like you never

02:04.714 --> 02:06.481
had that kind of problem.

02:06.549 --> 02:08.717
Well, when Eddie left,
Evan and I had each other,

02:08.785 --> 02:13.622
and even then I felt
alone a lot of the time.

02:13.690 --> 02:15.490
It's so weird.

02:15.558 --> 02:18.794
I mean, Eddie was a conman
who walked out on you two,

02:18.862 --> 02:20.596
and my mom was a conwoman who stuck around,

02:20.663 --> 02:23.432
and yet we both felt the same way.

02:23.499 --> 02:25.167
And we both turned out okay.

02:25.235 --> 02:27.169
Maybe there is something
to that whole DNA thing.

02:27.237 --> 02:30.906
- Maybe.
- [Chuckles]

02:30.974 --> 02:36.378
You know, I wanted to be a
doctor when I was little too.

02:36.446 --> 02:37.579
Really?

02:37.647 --> 02:39.014
Well, actually I wanted to be a paramedic,

02:39.082 --> 02:40.515
you know, so I could run
through all the red lights

02:40.583 --> 02:41.950
and have a really cool siren.

02:42.018 --> 02:43.318
[Laughs]

02:43.386 --> 02:45.988
[Laughs]

02:46.055 --> 02:48.223
Emma...

02:48.291 --> 02:51.660
I feel terrible that all of us
weren't in your life earlier,

02:51.728 --> 02:53.295
and we are so happy you're staying.

02:53.363 --> 02:56.798
I am so happy you're here.

02:56.866 --> 02:58.934
Me too.

02:59.002 --> 03:00.369
Hey, do you like to run?

03:00.436 --> 03:02.938
Uh, run as in jog,

03:03.006 --> 03:04.139
as in exercise?

03:04.207 --> 03:05.574
Yeah, that kind of running.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.348
Isn't this great?

03:13.416 --> 03:15.817
Yeah, this is so great.

03:28.464 --> 03:29.498
Ricky?

03:29.565 --> 03:30.499
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:30.566 --> 03:31.500
You okay?

03:31.567 --> 03:32.501
Yeah.

03:32.568 --> 03:33.835
Hey, Hank. I'm fine.

03:33.903 --> 03:35.070
I'm fine. It was nothing.

03:35.138 --> 03:37.439
Yeah, but you know, with your...

03:37.507 --> 03:38.707
Oh, yeah, don't worry.

03:38.775 --> 03:40.175
I'm taking my blood thinners every day.

03:40.243 --> 03:41.276
Okay.

03:41.344 --> 03:42.377
Oh, sorry.

03:42.445 --> 03:43.779
Ricky, this is my little sister, Emma.

03:43.846 --> 03:45.113
Emma, this is Ricky White.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.815
He medaled in Sochi.

03:46.883 --> 03:47.849
Yeah, well, you know,

03:47.917 --> 03:49.251
a lot of people medaled in Sochi.

03:49.319 --> 03:50.752
Landing a 1440 with two somersaults

03:50.820 --> 03:53.055
means you don't have to
be modest, my friend.

03:53.122 --> 03:54.089
You're right.

03:54.157 --> 03:55.390
He's right. I'm fantastic.

03:55.458 --> 03:56.658
[Giggles]

03:56.726 --> 03:58.327
But you did take a pretty bad spill there.

03:58.394 --> 04:01.496
If you want me to take a look, we can do
your annual physical at the same time.

04:01.564 --> 04:03.832
Yeah, uh, well, to be honest,

04:03.900 --> 04:05.934
I'm not with Hankmed anymore.

04:06.002 --> 04:06.969
Oh.

04:07.036 --> 04:08.971
Yeah, I signed up with Symphony.

04:09.038 --> 04:10.806
They started offering a concierge service

04:10.873 --> 04:12.407
when they took over Hamptons Heritage.

04:12.475 --> 04:13.608
Awkward.

04:13.676 --> 04:15.544
They made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

04:15.611 --> 04:17.112
No hard feelings?

04:17.180 --> 04:18.579
No, no. Of course not.

04:18.648 --> 04:20.615
I'm just glad you're
taking care of yourself.

04:20.683 --> 04:22.017
Yeah.

04:22.084 --> 04:23.251
Well, listen, I'm having a barbecue

04:23.319 --> 04:24.586
with some friends later.
You guys should come.

04:24.654 --> 04:25.587
Ah. I'd love to,

04:25.655 --> 04:26.588
but I have patients.

04:26.656 --> 04:28.724
I don't.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.192
Great.

04:30.259 --> 04:31.593
Uh, well, here.

04:31.661 --> 04:34.696
Give me your number,
and I'll text you the address.

04:34.764 --> 04:35.931
Okay.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.766
Yeah, this is...

04:48.211 --> 04:50.912
The mouldings are so beautiful.

04:50.980 --> 04:52.080
I got them wholesale,

04:52.148 --> 04:54.349
but still they're crazy expensive.

04:54.417 --> 04:55.384
Have you given much thought

04:55.451 --> 04:56.518
about how you'd like to decorate?

04:56.586 --> 04:57.819
I like those things Russel got

04:57.887 --> 04:59.321
in that hedge fund guy's house.

04:59.389 --> 05:01.356
The one in the Hamptons magazine?

05:01.424 --> 05:03.025
You think you could find
me some stuff like that?

05:03.092 --> 05:06.194
Of course, but his house is modern,

05:06.262 --> 05:08.096
and yours is more classic.

05:08.164 --> 05:09.564
What kind of style do you like?

05:09.632 --> 05:11.533
What do I know from style?

05:11.601 --> 05:13.769
My wife... technically we're separated,

05:13.836 --> 05:16.338
but not for long since
I'm gonna win her back...

05:16.406 --> 05:17.372
She thinks I'm too Jersey.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.673
Uncle Ray, you want a water?

05:18.741 --> 05:20.008
No, I'm good, Marco.

05:20.076 --> 05:23.011
Well, we'd love to find
you some nice pieces.

05:23.079 --> 05:24.679
Where would you like to start?

05:24.747 --> 05:25.981
From the beginning.

05:26.049 --> 05:29.484
I need rugs, tables, pictures,

05:29.552 --> 05:32.320
the works, and I want the best.

05:32.388 --> 05:36.291
I want it to feel like the Hamptons.

05:36.359 --> 05:37.559
Well, don't worry.

05:37.627 --> 05:39.628
Russel Berger's the best in the business.

05:39.695 --> 05:41.596
Ah.

05:41.664 --> 05:43.131
Are you okay?

05:43.199 --> 05:45.267
Yeah, I've been itching like crazy lately.

05:45.334 --> 05:48.870
I've tried Benadryl,
cortizone cream, olive oil.

05:48.938 --> 05:50.672
Nothing's helped.

05:50.740 --> 05:52.941
Well, I know someone who might be able to.

05:53.009 --> 05:55.544
[Sighs]

05:55.611 --> 05:56.711
Good morning.

05:56.779 --> 05:57.846
Hey, how's the new nanny working out?

05:57.914 --> 05:59.047
Shh. I don't want to jinx it.

05:59.115 --> 06:00.215
Can we start? We've got a busy day ahead.

06:00.283 --> 06:01.283
Henry will be sitting over here today.

06:01.350 --> 06:02.851
Why?

06:02.919 --> 06:03.852
Ha.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.120
How'd you even lift that?

06:05.188 --> 06:06.121
Hurt myself doing it.

06:06.189 --> 06:07.489
- Let's go.
- Okay.

06:07.557 --> 06:08.790
- So...
- So I ran into Ricky White

06:08.858 --> 06:10.025
this morning on the beach.

06:10.093 --> 06:11.560
He said he signed up with Symphony.

06:11.627 --> 06:14.029
Yeah, we've lost a couple
retainers to them recently.

06:14.097 --> 06:15.464
They've started going after
our patients pretty aggressively.

06:15.531 --> 06:16.965
Well, how come I didn't know?

06:17.033 --> 06:18.834
Because you said you didn't
want to know about business.

06:18.901 --> 06:19.835
You just wanted to be a doctor.

06:19.902 --> 06:21.002
Why, did you change your mind?

06:21.070 --> 06:22.204
No, you're right. You're right.

06:22.271 --> 06:23.672
I could follow up with Gladys about that.

06:23.739 --> 06:24.906
- Gladys?
- Don't tell him.

06:24.974 --> 06:26.441
- He doesn't want to know.
- Gladys is the director

06:26.509 --> 06:28.076
of Symphony's community relations.

06:28.144 --> 06:29.878
- Oh.
- She loves hazelnut coffee.

06:29.946 --> 06:31.346
The fact is, guys, we're in a more

06:31.414 --> 06:34.015
competitive environment now, so
we need to think outside the box.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.784
Nancy Conrad will help us with that.

06:35.852 --> 06:37.085
Who's Nancy Conrad?

06:37.153 --> 06:38.386
I'm so glad you asked,
and I'm gonna tell you

06:38.454 --> 06:40.255
as soon as you sign these release forms.

06:40.323 --> 06:41.256
Pass them down.

06:41.324 --> 06:43.058
Hi, everyone. Bye, everyone.

06:43.126 --> 06:44.726
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where're you going?

06:44.794 --> 06:47.129
Um, meeting some friends from work.

06:47.196 --> 06:48.130
Is that okay?

06:48.197 --> 06:49.464
Oh, yeah, sure.

06:49.532 --> 06:51.366
So I see your trainer's
got you up and running

06:51.434 --> 06:52.534
at the crack of dawn, huh?

06:52.602 --> 06:55.003
Yeah, running is such good exercise.

06:55.071 --> 06:56.571
I only said yes 'cause I
thought he was kidding.

06:56.639 --> 06:58.106
El jefe doesn't kid about running.

06:58.174 --> 06:59.374
Do they not know I'm here?

06:59.442 --> 07:00.809
Um, a little heads up next time?

07:00.877 --> 07:01.810
You got it.

07:01.878 --> 07:03.111
Great. Squid?

07:03.179 --> 07:05.981
You want to squid it out? [Both blubbering]

07:06.048 --> 07:08.083
Okay, bye. Why didn't you ask

07:08.151 --> 07:09.284
who these friends were that she's meeting?

07:09.352 --> 07:10.719
- Why didn't you ask?
- I can't.

07:10.786 --> 07:12.087
- I'm the fun brother.
- You're not the fun brother.

07:12.155 --> 07:13.155
I'm the fun brother.

07:13.222 --> 07:14.389
- Is that a joke?
- I didn't have to ask.

07:14.457 --> 07:16.224
She's doing great. She's working hard.

07:16.292 --> 07:17.559
She gets up early to run with me.

07:17.627 --> 07:18.994
Yeah, how did you get her
to do that, by the way?

07:19.061 --> 07:22.864
Did you, like, pay her?

07:22.932 --> 07:26.034
Why would I do that?

07:26.102 --> 07:27.302
I don't know. No reason.

07:27.370 --> 07:29.771
Did you pay her to do something, Evan?

07:29.839 --> 07:31.006
Did I pay her to do something?

07:31.073 --> 07:32.207
Yeah.

07:32.275 --> 07:34.442
That's a pretty weird question, Henry.

07:34.510 --> 07:36.945
Why don't we talk about it over there?

07:37.013 --> 07:39.317
Right now, please.

07:41.918 --> 07:43.151
Did you?

07:43.219 --> 07:46.221
I-I gave her some money,
yeah, to cover expenses.

07:46.289 --> 07:47.689
Huh. When?

07:47.757 --> 07:49.057
Before she saw dad.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.058
You bribed her.

07:50.126 --> 07:52.394
No, I... I'm her brother.

07:52.461 --> 07:54.729
I gave her money that she needed,

07:54.797 --> 07:56.665
and then she saw dad.

07:56.732 --> 07:58.967
Evan, did she agree to stay
because you gave her money?

07:59.035 --> 08:01.336
What? I-I... maybe.

08:01.404 --> 08:02.904
Let's just say she did, okay?

08:02.972 --> 08:04.906
She got to know dad. She's living with you.

08:04.974 --> 08:06.575
We're getting to know her. She's working.

08:06.642 --> 08:07.943
It's great. What's the big deal?

08:08.010 --> 08:09.711
The big deal is you got
things off on the wrong foot

has a problem with the truth.

08:11.681 --> 08:12.614

She doesn't know who we are.

08:14.550 --> 08:15.684
You need to talk to her.

08:15.751 --> 08:19.087
Sorry to interrupt, but can we please start?

08:19.155 --> 08:20.622
- Yes, okay.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

eyes to the giant screen.

08:28.397 --> 08:30.599
This is Nancy Conrad before she got sick.

08:30.666 --> 08:31.833
She was a dance instructor

08:31.901 --> 08:34.369
who used to have a popular
blog about dancing.

08:34.437 --> 08:37.205
She put together a lot
of these dance videos,

08:37.273 --> 08:38.607
worked with a lot of kids.

08:38.674 --> 08:40.674
Aw, that's sweet.

08:40.743 --> 08:43.645
This is the homepage of her blog,

08:43.712 --> 08:45.747

08:45.815 --> 08:47.282

08:47.350 --> 08:49.251
She has never asked for help
with her medical expenses.

08:49.318 --> 08:50.819
People have just opened
up their hearts to her.

Someone posted a link on our page.

She lives upstate.

Dozens. That's the thing,

no one's been able to figure
out what's wrong with her.

09:02.965 --> 09:05.166
Everyone's pretty much just given up on her,

09:05.234 --> 09:08.403
except for us.

09:08.471 --> 09:09.537
It sounds like a P.R. stunt.

09:09.605 --> 09:10.905
It is a P.R. stunt.

09:10.973 --> 09:13.842
A stunt in which we're helping someone
no one else has been able to help,

09:13.909 --> 09:14.976

09:15.044 --> 09:16.011
It's a win-win.

- Okay, you're right.

09:18.814 --> 09:20.782
You're right. What's with the video camera?

09:20.850 --> 09:22.250
I promised all the Facebook groups

09:22.318 --> 09:23.785
I'd post daily updates.

What about patient confidentiality?

a house on Tyson Lane?

09:47.209 --> 09:50.478
You think he's in the mob because
he has an Italian last name?

09:50.546 --> 09:52.514
No, I think he's in the mob
because he's from New Jersey,

09:52.581 --> 09:53.948
and he's in the waste management business,

09:54.016 --> 09:56.217

18:43.923 --> 18:48.526
and now, poof, it's gone.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.266
Thanks.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.668
Hey, Ray. It's nice to meet you.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.136
You told me to call if it got worse.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.370
It definitely got worse.

18:59.438 --> 19:01.739
Okay. Tell me, what's going on?

19:01.807 --> 19:04.709
I'm tired, achy, got chills.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.178
Tell him about your stomach, Uncle Ray.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.947
Every time he touches it, it hurts.

19:09.014 --> 19:09.948
Uh-huh.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.216
Let me take a look.

19:11.283 --> 19:14.919
Tell me if any of this is tender, okay?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.187
Ah.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.456
- Ah.
- Huh.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.359
Have you ever had liver
problems, Mr. Mazzarini?

19:21.427 --> 19:23.394
"O."

19:23.462 --> 19:25.096
Mazzarino.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.364
Mazzarino. Heh.

19:26.432 --> 19:27.498
Of course, of course.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.367
Nah, booze has never been my vice.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.835
Liver conditions can cause itching,

19:30.903 --> 19:33.338
so I'd like to do an ultrasound
to check for gallstones,

19:33.405 --> 19:35.306
and let's draw blood for L.F.T.'s,

19:35.374 --> 19:38.142
C.B.C., chem panel, and hepatitis.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.911
And let's also get a urine sample.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.546
Look, I don't know how
things work in the Hamptons,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.314
but I want you to put a
rush on these test results.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.916
Oh, don't worry, we rush everyone.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.218
Doc, I'm begging you, please,

19:47.286 --> 19:49.254
if you can stop this itching, I'll comp you

19:49.321 --> 19:50.655
at my new restaurant for life.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.790
Hell, I'll put your kids through college.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.791
Either of you two have kids?

19:53.859 --> 19:56.928
No.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.999
No, I don't.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.467
Don't worry. We'll rush it.

20:10.576 --> 20:13.611
Hold on a second.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.481
Effective immediately?

20:16.548 --> 20:17.949
What the hell is this? This is crazy.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.317
We'll never be able to pay these rates.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.253
I miss Gladys.

20:22.321 --> 20:25.990
Well... I'll figure something out.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.058
This probably wouldn't have happened

20:27.126 --> 20:30.028
if Hank were still medical director.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.796
No, you're wrong.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.164
This would have happened under anyone.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.000
This is just business.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.403
That's my territory.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.768
So, Nancy, all the tests were negative,

21:10.836 --> 21:12.937
but your symptoms point to

21:13.005 --> 21:16.708
idiopathic transverse myelitis.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.176
Well, that sounds awful.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.744
It's a neurological disorder

21:19.812 --> 21:22.280
caused by inflammation of the spinal cord.

21:22.348 --> 21:24.382
See? I told you he'd figure it out.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.450
What caused it?

21:25.517 --> 21:27.385
Hold on.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.855
Um, well, idiopathic is a fancy term

21:30.923 --> 21:34.192
the medical community came
up with to basically say,

21:34.259 --> 21:36.728
"we're not sure why this is happening."

21:36.795 --> 21:38.162
Wait, what?

21:38.230 --> 21:40.732
But, you can do something though, right?

21:40.799 --> 21:42.600
I'm gonna prescribe some pain medication

21:42.668 --> 21:44.135
and put you on a course of steroids

21:44.203 --> 21:48.306
that may reduce the inflammation.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.841
May?

21:49.908 --> 21:51.709
Nancy, there's no definitive cure.

21:51.777 --> 21:54.846
But will the paralysis get worse?

21:54.913 --> 21:56.147
It might stay just like it is,

21:56.215 --> 21:58.282
but yes, there is a chance

21:58.350 --> 22:03.688
your condition could deteriorate.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.924
Well, it's not the news I was looking for,

22:06.992 --> 22:10.962
but... but it's an answer.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.697
- Thank you, Hank.
- Of course.

22:12.765 --> 22:16.434
And, Evan, I will be forever in your debt.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.377
I feel so bad for her.

22:26.445 --> 22:27.699
Yeah, I know.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.649
But she doesn't feel bad for her.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.216
She's, like, happy.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.491
It's amazing to me.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.324
Would I react like that if it were me?

22:40.392 --> 22:42.693
The last time you had the flu,
you begged me to kill you

22:42.761 --> 22:44.429
and put you out of your misery.

22:44.496 --> 22:45.963
- I was kidding.
- You specifically said

22:46.031 --> 22:47.532
you weren't kidding and
that I should ignore you

22:47.599 --> 22:49.500
if you said you were kidding, and kill you.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.501
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

22:50.569 --> 22:51.636
I get it. I'm a wuss.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.472
I didn't say it.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.473
How do you do it?

22:55.541 --> 22:56.941
How do I do what?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.576
Not get emotionally crushed every time

22:58.644 --> 23:01.446
one of your patients has a setback?

23:01.513 --> 23:02.981
Who says I don't?

23:05.517 --> 23:08.553
You know why I became a doctor.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.921
Mom.

23:09.988 --> 23:13.658
Hardest thing I ever had
to do was watch mom suffer.

23:13.725 --> 23:17.061
I didn't ever want to
feel that helpless again.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.096
But you see people all the time.

23:18.163 --> 23:19.097
Some of them you can't help.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.098
What happens then?

23:20.165 --> 23:22.500
It hurts.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.570
I hurt.

23:25.637 --> 23:27.138
Whoa.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.207
I could never do that.

23:29.274 --> 23:30.475
I'd be a basket case.

23:30.542 --> 23:33.244
I have a good support system.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.980
So does Nancy.

23:36.048 --> 23:39.383
I'm gonna personally
donate to her medical fund.

23:39.451 --> 23:42.220
She's gonna need all the help
she can get moving forward.

23:42.287 --> 23:44.055
I am proud of my little brother.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.223
I'm a big brother now.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.524
- That's right.
- Yeah.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.859
Speaking of, where's Emma?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.394
At a barbecue at Ricky White's.

23:50.462 --> 23:51.596
Sorry, what'd you just say?

23:51.663 --> 23:54.165
Ricky White? The snowboarder Ricky White?

23:54.233 --> 23:55.333
That's the one.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.734
And you think I'm irresponsible?

23:56.802 --> 23:57.735
What the hell are you think...

23:57.803 --> 23:58.736
She can't go to that.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.171
Ricky's a really good guy.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.706
- No, you're missing the point.
- I understand the point,

24:01.773 --> 24:03.441
and you should understand
that she's not a child.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.276
She's a month away from turning 18.

24:05.344 --> 24:08.045
She managed to get halfway
across the country without our help.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.647
We promised dad we'd be responsible for her.

24:09.715 --> 24:12.350
Even if we hadn't done that,
we're her older brothers, Henry.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.218
People at that barbecue,
we don't know who they are,

24:14.286 --> 24:15.586
how old they are,

24:15.654 --> 24:17.822
what they're like when
they've been drinking.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.590
Remember the trouble I got into at that age?

24:19.658 --> 24:22.527
That was when you were watching me.

24:22.594 --> 24:23.594
Oh, God.

24:38.510 --> 24:41.546
[Indistinct chatter]

25:14.713 --> 25:16.347
- Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
- Hey, what's the score?

25:16.415 --> 25:18.916
Gotta get a picture of Ricky. [Chuckles]

25:18.984 --> 25:21.419
You're probably not gonna
get much for that photo,

25:21.486 --> 25:22.853
not unless there's a bong in it.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.422
Oh, I was just gonna put it on Instagram

25:24.489 --> 25:25.923
for my friends back home.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.559
I thought you were gonna try
and sell it to Snarkhampton.

25:28.627 --> 25:30.094
What is Snarkhampton?

25:30.162 --> 25:32.230
It's a Hamptons gossip site.

25:32.297 --> 25:33.531
If you've got dirt on a celeb,

25:33.599 --> 25:36.434
they'll pay you to wallow in it.

25:36.501 --> 25:37.435
Huh.

25:40.339 --> 25:41.405
[Wincing]

25:41.473 --> 25:43.741
Ah! [Groans]

26:03.595 --> 26:05.196
Hank?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.530
What are you doing here?

26:06.598 --> 26:08.199
I thought you weren't coming.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.936
No, uh, change of plans.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.871
Sorry.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.341
Ricky.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.409
Hey, you made it.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.311
I need to check out your leg.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.713
Hank, it's not that kind of party.

26:22.781 --> 26:24.615
[Chuckles] Oh, you're serious.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.284
Please, have a seat.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.019
Okay.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.295
Ugh.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.957
Okay.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.889
[Groans]

26:36.928 --> 26:39.330
What's the pain like on a one to ten scale?

26:39.398 --> 26:40.431
Nothing I can't handle.

26:40.499 --> 26:41.899
Ricky.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.634
Maybe an eight.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.703
W-why does my leg look so gnarly?

26:45.771 --> 26:47.571
I think you tore your
calf muscle this morning

26:47.639 --> 26:49.440
when you wiped out, and
because of the blood thinner

26:49.508 --> 26:50.941
you're taking for your arteritis,

26:51.009 --> 26:53.044
you're bleeding into the
muscle, creating pressure.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.945
I need to reduce that pressure right now

26:55.013 --> 26:56.714
or you could develop compartment syndrome,

26:56.782 --> 26:59.383
and, well, you could lose your leg.

27:02.587 --> 27:04.889
Hey, can you shut that door?

27:04.956 --> 27:05.923
Emma, I'm glad you're here.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.692
- I'm gonna need your help.
- Okay.

27:07.759 --> 27:10.728
Do whatever you got to do.
My legs are my life.

27:10.796 --> 27:15.178
Emma, I need you to grab the
biohazard container from inside my bag.

27:15.212 --> 27:16.713
- It's a red box.
- Yeah, I got it.

27:16.780 --> 27:17.714
Okay, good.

27:21.218 --> 27:24.988
Okay, also I'm gonna need another...

27:25.055 --> 27:27.123
Thank you.

27:27.191 --> 27:30.527
Now I need some gauze and an ice wrap.

27:30.594 --> 27:31.761
Thanks.

27:31.829 --> 27:34.597
Good.

27:34.665 --> 27:35.598
How's the pain now?

27:35.666 --> 27:37.534
- It's better.
- Good.

27:37.601 --> 27:38.701
Thank you.

27:38.769 --> 27:39.936
We're gonna get you to the hospital

27:40.004 --> 27:41.437
to evacuate the rest of the hematoma.

27:41.505 --> 27:42.672
Wow, was that just luck?

27:42.740 --> 27:44.073
How'd you know something
was wrong with my leg?

27:44.141 --> 27:46.676
I saw you grabbing your calf before.

27:46.744 --> 27:50.780
Before when? I thought you just got here?

27:50.848 --> 27:52.782
Or did you?

27:59.920 --> 28:02.580
Good morning. What happened to you?

28:06.264 --> 28:08.799
Pappy van winkle. Nice.

28:08.866 --> 28:10.600
Ugh.

28:10.668 --> 28:11.835
Keep it.

28:11.903 --> 28:14.404
I never want to see it again.

28:14.472 --> 28:16.306
Here, have a banana, plenty of water,

28:16.374 --> 28:18.108
take two aspirin, and
call me in the morning.

28:18.176 --> 28:19.242
I think I'm gonna go lay down.

28:19.310 --> 28:21.678
- Okay.
- Yeah, listen to Hank.

28:21.746 --> 28:22.746
He knows it all.

28:22.814 --> 28:24.081
Totally.

28:24.148 --> 28:27.084
He even saved me from a
super dangerous barbecue.

28:27.151 --> 28:29.052
If he hadn't shown up,

28:29.120 --> 28:30.320
might have had a second burger.

28:30.388 --> 28:32.756
- Emma, you know that...
- What were you really doing there?

28:32.824 --> 28:34.791
That's a good question.
What were you doing there?

28:34.859 --> 28:36.259
I was checking up on you.

28:36.327 --> 28:38.195
I don't need to be checked up on.

28:38.262 --> 28:40.564
Anyways, if you want to
worry about somebody,

28:40.631 --> 28:42.642
worry about her.

28:42.710 --> 28:44.144
We are worried about her. She's a patient.

28:44.211 --> 28:45.812
Right, a patient who's lying.

28:45.880 --> 28:46.846
Wow, that's harsh.

28:46.914 --> 28:48.047
You don't even know her.

28:48.115 --> 28:49.649
She's really nice. Her name's Nancy.

28:49.717 --> 28:51.851
She has idiosyncratic harkalina...

28:51.919 --> 28:52.986
What is it?

28:53.053 --> 28:54.787
It's idiopathic transverse myelitis.

28:54.855 --> 28:57.090
- Myelitis.
- Okay, is that hard to fake?

28:57.158 --> 28:58.725
It's impossible to fake, right?

28:58.792 --> 29:02.128
Uh, actually, no, I wouldn't
say it's impossible.

29:02.196 --> 29:04.631
I mean, it's a diagnosis of exclusion,

29:04.698 --> 29:06.900
so she wouldn't have to
fake any actual tests.

29:06.967 --> 29:08.201
But why do you think she's lying?

29:08.269 --> 29:10.436
Look at her.

29:10.504 --> 29:13.239
She keeps touching her nose
and covering her mouth.

29:13.307 --> 29:15.475
She keeps swallowing.

29:15.543 --> 29:17.243
My mom might not have taught
me how to ride a bike,

29:17.311 --> 29:19.579
but she did teach me how
to read people's tells.

29:19.647 --> 29:21.748
You're saying if you swallow, you're a liar?

29:21.815 --> 29:24.350
What, you... you think she's lying?

29:24.418 --> 29:26.986
There is a test that would
prove it one way or the other.

29:29.290 --> 29:30.990
Of course.

29:31.058 --> 29:32.192
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

29:32.259 --> 29:34.327
Let me know if you need anything else.

29:34.395 --> 29:36.396
So I was looking up those steroids

29:36.463 --> 29:38.031
- you were going to give me.
- Mmhmm.

29:38.098 --> 29:39.566
They, um, seem very expensive.

29:39.633 --> 29:41.401
Oh, well, lucky for you,
you've got all those people

29:41.468 --> 29:43.069
online raising money for you.

29:43.137 --> 29:44.571
Yeah. I'm very lucky.

29:44.638 --> 29:45.805
You are.

29:45.873 --> 29:47.440
There is one more test I'd like to perform.

29:47.508 --> 29:49.666
It's called a Hoover test.

29:49.666 --> 29:52.154
I'd like to remove this blanket.

29:53.621 --> 29:56.713
And... take down the foot rest.

29:57.113 --> 29:58.175
Okay.

29:58.242 --> 30:02.412
Now, Nancy, I'd like you to lift
your right leg as best you can.

30:11.856 --> 30:12.789
Hmm.

30:12.857 --> 30:13.924
What does this test do?

30:13.991 --> 30:15.158
Well, when you raise one leg,

30:15.226 --> 30:17.093
you naturally put pressure on the calcaneus

30:17.161 --> 30:18.995
of your opposite leg to gain leverage

30:19.063 --> 30:20.330
which creates downward pressure,

30:20.398 --> 30:24.935
but only if you can move your leg.

30:25.002 --> 30:28.839
Nancy, your left leg is
not paralyzed at all.

30:28.906 --> 30:31.141
What are you talking about?
What are you saying?

30:31.209 --> 30:32.909
I think you know what I'm saying.

30:32.977 --> 30:34.811
Oh, my God.

30:34.879 --> 30:36.313
You are just like the other doctors.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.482
You can't figure it out,
so you're blaming me.

30:38.549 --> 30:39.483
You know, I thought you
were different, Hank.

30:39.550 --> 30:40.684
Nancy, Nancy.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.152
No, please, I would like to leave now.

30:42.220 --> 30:44.020
I would like to leave right now.

30:44.088 --> 30:48.024
[Gasping]

30:48.092 --> 30:50.227
Oh, my God.

30:50.294 --> 30:53.330
I'm so sorry.

30:56.501 --> 30:59.102
Nancy, why did you...

30:59.170 --> 31:02.138
Why did you pretend to be paralyzed?

31:02.206 --> 31:04.140
It... I didn't set out to do it.

31:04.208 --> 31:07.677
I... it just happened.

31:07.745 --> 31:10.847
It just happened?

31:10.915 --> 31:13.950
I-I was in a car accident, and...

31:14.018 --> 31:16.286
And then I got all these
emails and posts on my blog,

31:16.354 --> 31:20.156
and... and people seemed to care about me.

31:29.200 --> 31:34.404
Nancy, you do need help,
but not the kind I can offer.

31:34.472 --> 31:38.542
I'm gonna refer you to a psychologist.

31:38.609 --> 31:40.944
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.887
Ray said 3:00, right?

31:50.955 --> 31:52.289
Mm-hmm. On the button.

32:02.516 --> 32:06.086
You wait here. I'm gonna check around back.

32:27.508 --> 32:29.976
[Alarm sounds]

32:30.044 --> 32:31.244
Ray!

32:31.312 --> 32:32.612
- Ray!
- Hank.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.747
[Groans]

32:33.814 --> 32:35.315
Where did all this blood come from?

32:35.382 --> 32:36.649
I yakked it up.

32:36.717 --> 32:40.620
Help me, please. I feel terrible.

32:40.688 --> 32:41.654
Hematemesis.

32:41.722 --> 32:44.057
- What?
- Esophageal varices.

32:45.226 --> 32:47.827
Uncle Ray.

32:47.895 --> 32:48.828
Whoa, whoa!

32:48.896 --> 32:50.997
What'd you do to my uncle?

32:51.065 --> 32:52.232
Get away from him.

32:52.299 --> 32:53.666
Marco, listen to me.

32:53.734 --> 32:54.901
You know who I am.

32:54.969 --> 32:55.935
You know I'm a doctor.

32:56.003 --> 32:57.871
I'm not gonna ask you again.

33:05.667 --> 33:07.134
Either I save his life right now,

33:07.202 --> 33:13.040
or, in an hour, you get to
tell your family how he died.

33:13.108 --> 33:14.441
Thank you. Call 9-1-1,

33:14.509 --> 33:16.946
and for the love of God, someone
please turn off that alarm!

33:17.146 --> 33:19.113
I got the alarm.

33:19.180 --> 33:21.782
We need to stop his
internal bleeding right now.

33:30.191 --> 33:33.026
Marco, I need you to hold this IV bag.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.027
Thank you.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.701
B.P.'s 80 over 50.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.784
Okay, IV's wide open.

33:42.852 --> 33:46.388
Pushing tight to defer blood flow.

33:49.425 --> 33:50.392
It's not working.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.593
He's getting worse.

33:51.661 --> 33:54.830
Okay, um, Divya, I need two N.G. tubes,

33:54.898 --> 33:56.732
two surgical gloves, and clamps.

33:56.799 --> 33:59.001
You, I need those pillows now.

33:59.068 --> 34:00.435
Here you are.

34:00.503 --> 34:02.237
Okay, Ray, I just need to prop you up.

34:02.305 --> 34:03.372
Ugh.

34:03.439 --> 34:04.439
That's it.

34:04.507 --> 34:06.308
- Ugh.
- First N.G. tube.

34:06.376 --> 34:07.843
Good.

34:13.683 --> 34:16.518
Okay. Second tube.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.407
Okay, good.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.083
Okay.

34:28.797 --> 34:30.498
Okay, Ray, I need you to open your mouth,

34:30.567 --> 34:32.199
and now swallow.

34:32.268 --> 34:33.768
[Gagging]

34:33.835 --> 34:36.972
That's it. Keep swallowing.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.143
Okay, clamp.

34:41.210 --> 34:42.763
Thank you.

34:45.415 --> 34:47.215
[Gags]

34:50.452 --> 34:52.485
Good. Second tube.

34:52.554 --> 34:54.889
Ray, I'm gonna need you to swallow again.

34:54.956 --> 34:55.989
That's it.

34:56.056 --> 34:57.024
That's it.

34:57.092 --> 34:58.292
Okay, second clamp.

35:04.633 --> 35:06.125
Okay.

35:08.103 --> 35:09.570
B.P. Stabilized.

35:09.638 --> 35:10.871
Good. [Sirens]

35:10.939 --> 35:14.708
Ray, we're gonna get
you to the hospital now.

35:14.776 --> 35:16.010
You're gonna be all right, Uncle Ray.

35:16.077 --> 35:17.444
[Sirens wailing]

35:17.512 --> 35:19.446
Thank you.

35:28.690 --> 35:30.057
Evan.

35:30.125 --> 35:34.061
Mm-hmm?

35:34.129 --> 35:35.462
Did you get my email?

35:35.530 --> 35:36.931
What's that?

35:36.998 --> 35:41.101
No, I haven't checked my email.

35:41.169 --> 35:45.005
This is how I look when, uh,
things blow up in my face.

35:45.073 --> 35:46.974
Nancy?

35:47.042 --> 35:48.475
It's not gonna be the Hankmed game changer

35:48.543 --> 35:50.945
I thought it would be, that's for sure.

35:51.012 --> 35:53.180
Turned out to be a lose-lose.

35:53.248 --> 35:54.381
What was that email about?

35:54.449 --> 35:56.354
Oh, um, well, I know that you said

35:56.610 --> 35:58.745
that the price increase
would be a business problem,

35:58.812 --> 35:59.746
but I put some thought into it,

35:59.813 --> 36:01.047
and I may have a solution.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.148
Yeah?

36:02.216 --> 36:03.917
I visited the lab in Riverhead.

36:03.984 --> 36:06.352
The quality is comparable
to Hamptons Heritage.

36:06.420 --> 36:09.188
We can use a courier service
and send all our tests over there.

36:09.256 --> 36:10.523
Obviously it would add to the cost,

36:10.591 --> 36:14.227
but I-I think it would
be an acceptable amount.

36:14.295 --> 36:15.995
That might work for the labs,

36:16.063 --> 36:18.765
but we'll never get our patients
to drive an hour and a half

36:18.832 --> 36:21.334
roundtrip to get an MRI.

36:21.402 --> 36:25.071
Think about it.

36:25.139 --> 36:27.607
Our business model doesn't work any more.

36:27.675 --> 36:28.808
How bad is it?

36:28.876 --> 36:30.877
I ran the numbers ten different ways.

36:30.945 --> 36:36.249
If we have to absorb these price increases,

36:36.317 --> 36:38.718
this could be the last summer of Hankmed.

36:47.861 --> 36:51.064
Okay, so, Ray,

36:51.131 --> 36:53.032
the bile duct test confirmed that you have

36:53.100 --> 36:56.636
primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC.

36:56.704 --> 36:58.972
It's a disease that causes
inflammation and obstruction

36:59.039 --> 37:02.075
of your bile ducts in
and outside your liver.

37:02.142 --> 37:03.276
Well, how'd I get it?

37:03.344 --> 37:05.078
We actually don't know what causes it.

37:05.145 --> 37:06.279
It just happens to some people.

37:06.347 --> 37:09.015
More bad luck than anything.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.216
So what now?

37:10.284 --> 37:11.317
We've got you on a three week course

37:11.385 --> 37:12.852
of broad spectrum antibiotics.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.187
And with careful monitoring,

37:14.254 --> 37:16.456
you'll be able to resume your...

37:16.523 --> 37:18.955
Your normal lifestyle.

37:20.427 --> 37:23.062
Well, sounds like I'm gonna
be a long-term customer.

37:23.130 --> 37:24.630
- Marco.
- Uh...

37:31.572 --> 37:32.638
What's this?

37:32.706 --> 37:34.807
A down payment on a Hankmed retainer.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.142
Oh.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.744
You take cash, right?

37:37.811 --> 37:41.581
Uh, yeah. I think we do.

37:54.912 --> 37:57.079
Is that a picture of Ricky at the party?

37:57.147 --> 37:58.181
Yeah.

37:58.248 --> 38:01.918
How did, uh, Snarkhampton get it?

38:01.985 --> 38:04.620
I guess someone sold it to them.

38:04.688 --> 38:06.155
[Scoffs]

38:06.223 --> 38:08.090
Whatever happened to respecting
someone's privacy, you know?

38:08.158 --> 38:12.862
Yeah. [Chuckles]

38:12.930 --> 38:14.897
I mean, I'm just glad that Ricky's okay.

38:14.965 --> 38:16.265
Yeah, me too.

38:16.333 --> 38:20.013
He was lucky that you were,
uh, in the neighborhood.

38:22.139 --> 38:23.472
Okay, okay.

38:23.540 --> 38:27.076
So maybe I didn't give you
the benefit of the doubt.

38:27.144 --> 38:28.244
Maybe?

38:28.312 --> 38:29.312
Probably.

38:29.379 --> 38:31.614
- Probably?
- Okay, definitely.

38:31.682 --> 38:35.251
I definitely did not give you
the benefit of the doubt.

38:35.319 --> 38:37.897
I apologize. I shouldn't have followed you.

38:37.965 --> 38:40.166
Truth is you've handled
yourself incredibly well.

38:40.234 --> 38:44.103
You were pretty cool under
pressure at the barbecue.

38:44.171 --> 38:45.838
I'm proud of you.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.273
Thanks.

38:47.341 --> 38:48.474
It's kind of nice having
someone else in the family

38:48.542 --> 38:50.276
who doesn't faint at the sight of blood.

38:50.344 --> 38:51.811
Yeah, well, what do you expect

38:51.879 --> 38:53.479
from a guy who drinks appletinis?

38:53.547 --> 38:56.816
Oh, squiddy.

38:56.884 --> 38:58.951
Yeah, it's squid out, and
we'll find our own thing.

38:59.019 --> 39:00.520
Okay, yeah, okay, will do.

39:00.587 --> 39:01.621
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:01.688 --> 39:03.656
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:03.724 --> 39:05.024
[Whispering] You didn't talk
to her about that thing, right?

39:05.092 --> 39:07.560
That thing we talked about? 'Cause I
told you I was gonna handle it myself?

39:07.628 --> 39:09.395
Uh, no, but now might be the perfect time.

39:09.463 --> 39:10.930
- For what?
- For Evan to talk to you

39:10.998 --> 39:14.700
about something that he
actually has to talk to you about.

39:14.768 --> 39:16.802
- [Chuckles]
- Heh.

39:16.870 --> 39:20.773
It's not... It's not, like,
a thing, I just... I...

39:20.841 --> 39:22.642
I might have given you the wrong impression

39:22.709 --> 39:25.278
when I gave you the,
you know, back in the...

39:25.345 --> 39:27.246
When I gave you the...

39:27.314 --> 39:29.015
When you gave me what?

39:29.082 --> 39:30.149
When he gave you money.

39:30.217 --> 39:31.617
The money.

39:31.685 --> 39:33.619
You said that was because
things were expensive here.

39:33.687 --> 39:34.954
That's exactly... that's... that's...

39:35.022 --> 39:36.656
- Well, they are.
- I thought that was a gift,

39:36.723 --> 39:37.957
but if you want the money
back, I can totally...

39:38.025 --> 39:38.958
No, no, it was a gift.

39:39.026 --> 39:40.059
Absolutely not.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.135
That's not why we brought it up.

39:42.935 --> 39:44.440
Oh, my God.

39:44.440 --> 39:47.200
You think I stayed because of the money?

39:47.200 --> 39:49.011
Because if you do, you are totally wrong.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.241
I stayed because I wanted
to get to know Eddie.

39:51.308 --> 39:52.942
That's what I said.

39:53.010 --> 39:55.945
And now, I really like it here.

39:56.013 --> 39:57.447
So does that clear everything up?

39:57.515 --> 39:59.215
- It does.
- Yes, it does.

39:59.283 --> 40:01.184
I'm so sorry this is awkward, but yeah.

40:01.252 --> 40:02.318
Great. [Chuckles]

40:02.386 --> 40:04.487
So good. I'm glad we talked it out.

40:04.555 --> 40:05.488
Yeah.

40:05.556 --> 40:06.643
Cool.

40:08.392 --> 40:09.392
What did I tell you?

40:09.460 --> 40:10.460
I told you it wasn't a bribe.

40:10.528 --> 40:11.895
Yeah, I know.

40:11.962 --> 40:13.563
I'd feel a lot better if
she didn't touch her nose

40:13.631 --> 40:15.331
when she said it wasn't.

40:27.344 --> 40:28.378
Good morning.

40:28.445 --> 40:30.580
Hi, Ray. How you feeling?

40:30.648 --> 40:33.950
I'm fine, thanks to Hank and Divya.

40:34.018 --> 40:36.386
If you hadn't referred me to them...

40:36.453 --> 40:37.987
I don't even want to think about that.

40:38.055 --> 40:39.189
We're glad you're okay.

40:39.256 --> 40:40.223
Look at you guys.

40:40.291 --> 40:41.624
Already you're working.

40:41.692 --> 40:44.470
I knew I made the right choice with you two.

40:46.096 --> 40:47.597
About that.

40:47.665 --> 40:49.432
Yeah?

40:49.500 --> 40:51.167
We're really sorry,

40:51.235 --> 40:54.302
but we're not gonna be
able to work with you.

40:55.397 --> 40:57.427
We are no longer with
Sutton and Chesterfield.

40:59.445 --> 41:02.280
Well, I could care less about
Sutton and Chesterfield.

41:02.348 --> 41:03.848
But you signed a contract with them.

41:03.916 --> 41:05.717
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

41:05.784 --> 41:07.785
You just take care of my house.

41:07.853 --> 41:11.422
I'll take care of the contract.

41:11.490 --> 41:13.858
Why don't we work with you
as your private consultants,

41:13.926 --> 41:15.026
Mr. Mazzarino?

41:15.094 --> 41:19.430
Yes, yes, your private consultants.

41:19.498 --> 41:20.932
Call me Ray.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.935
It's decided. Lawson and Berger,

41:24.003 --> 41:26.504
you are now employed directly by me.

41:26.572 --> 41:30.508
Berger and Lawson.

41:36.549 --> 41:38.883
Sacani.

41:38.951 --> 41:40.451
Oh, that's him. That's the new Gladys.

41:40.519 --> 41:41.586
Oh. Hi there.

41:41.654 --> 41:43.821
Evan R. Lawson, CFO of Hankmed.

41:43.889 --> 41:45.256
Bill Cartwright.

41:45.324 --> 41:46.524
Bringing in the big guns, huh?

41:46.592 --> 41:49.561
Well, I think kudos are in order.

41:49.628 --> 41:50.762
What for?

41:50.829 --> 41:52.497
You got your famous snowboarder back.

41:52.565 --> 41:56.000
I have to admit, I underestimated you.

41:56.068 --> 41:58.269
But at the end of the day,

41:58.337 --> 42:01.205
when it comes to labs and equipment,

42:01.273 --> 42:02.206
we're still the only game in town.

42:03.407 --> 42:06.205
Game theory would suggest
there's always alternatives.

42:06.243 --> 42:09.058
Well, what are you gonna do?
You're gonna start your own hospital?

42:18.185 --> 42:20.760
I wish we could start our own hospital.
