WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:02.328
- Previously on Being Human...

00:02.370 --> 00:05.567
- You're more pathetic
as a ghost then you were--

00:05.600 --> 00:07.694
- SHUT UP!

00:07.740 --> 00:09.060
- I'm not the
kind of guy

00:09.110 --> 00:10.805
who mounts
women spontaneously

00:10.840 --> 00:13.309
and has furious animal sex.

00:13.340 --> 00:15.104
- I can't believe
I did it myself.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.277
- I wanna be with you,

00:16.309 --> 00:18.677
but there's something
in my life.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.077
(Screaming, growling)

00:21.120 --> 00:23.509
- And we have the numbers
and we have the power.

00:23.550 --> 00:24.847
We won't have to hide.

00:24.890 --> 00:26.449
We can live right out
in the open.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.481
- Aidan! Rebecca fixed me.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.954
I wish I was
like this before,

00:29.990 --> 00:32.299
then those boys wouldn't
have messed with me.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.321
- Thank you for taking
care of those boys.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.327
- Whatever I can do.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.964
(Rebecca screaming)

00:37.000 --> 00:39.298
- Listen to me!
He was out of control.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.536
- You couldn't teach him,
like you said to me?

00:41.570 --> 00:44.961
- The Dutch are here.
- The way you live is an insult to the empire they've built.

00:45.010 --> 00:46.000
- I'll come back.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.439
- Could you be
more specific?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.369
Come back to...
- To you.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.312
I'll come back to you.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.319
The only constant in life...

00:59.360 --> 01:01.351
is change.

01:01.390 --> 01:02.755
People, as a species,

01:02.790 --> 01:06.124
are in a constant state
of metamorphosis.

01:09.030 --> 01:12.000
Just when we get comfortable
swimming in the sea,

01:12.030 --> 01:13.134
we end up on land.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.889
The moment we become
accustom to crawling,

01:15.940 --> 01:17.203
we stand on 2 legs.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.560
- After you.

01:18.610 --> 01:23.502
- Our instinct is to
resist change, to fear it,

01:23.550 --> 01:26.144
SO we wrap a pretty word
like "evolution” around it

01:26.180 --> 01:31.084
and hope that it will make
the pill easier to swallow.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.349
(Clears throat)

01:32.390 --> 01:35.189
- Well... this is one of
our better additions to Boston

01:35.220 --> 01:36.688
since your last visit.

01:36.730 --> 01:40.098
We've reserved the entire
space for your enjoyment.

01:40.130 --> 01:41.598
- What about the harbour?

01:41.630 --> 01:44.270
- Again, the harbour isn't
what it used to be.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.997
There's too many people
there now, tourists,

01:47.040 --> 01:48.166
even at night.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.009
- But we always
go to the harbour.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.667
- We like to feed
by the water.

01:51.710 --> 01:52.780
- Yes, well...

01:52.810 --> 01:53.777
(Clears throat)

01:53.810 --> 01:55.005
Maybe next time.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.678
- They aren't chained.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.075
Were they compelled?

01:59.110 --> 02:00.839
- No, there's no need.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.110
The agreement is
that we feed, not Kill.

02:03.150 --> 02:04.584
They're here by choice.

02:04.620 --> 02:07.715
Some, because they hope
to be diners someday.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.229
And... some have issues.

02:11.190 --> 02:13.295
- But you don't drain them?

02:14.430 --> 02:16.489
We do not
feed on blood.

02:16.530 --> 02:18.294
We feed on life.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.934
This is appalling.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.961
- Well, this is
a new reality.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.560
We're not asking you
to forsake your old ways,

02:24.610 --> 02:26.408
but you did say
you wanted to see

02:26.440 --> 02:29.478
how we lived here in
Boston, and this is it.

02:29.510 --> 02:33.242
Fenway Park,
Faneuil Hall...

02:33.280 --> 02:34.918
and Lola.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.815
Local treasures all.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.980
(Heart beating)

02:55.100 --> 02:57.706
- (Aidan):
The thing is,

02:57.740 --> 03:01.278
change doesn't care if
you love it or you hate it.

03:01.310 --> 03:04.302
Change is indifferent,
intractable.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.014
- Like I said, every cubicle
is here for your disposal.

03:09.550 --> 03:13.180
Or whatever you're into.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.249
- We will try
this city feeding.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.628
- You won't be disappointed.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.968
- And it will not be denied.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.094
- But we will
do it our way.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.729
(Women screaming)

03:34.240 --> 03:38.040
** And we surrender *

03:39.950 --> 03:42.044
* Stuck in... **

03:42.080 --> 03:43.582
- So...

03:44.620 --> 03:46.110
Aidan's back!

03:46.150 --> 03:47.584
- Mmm...

03:48.590 --> 03:50.228
It's wonderful,
isn't it?

03:51.260 --> 03:54.389
All of us together again
on our last day.

03:55.430 --> 03:56.591
- Our last day?

03:56.630 --> 03:57.791
- Mmm...

03:59.030 --> 04:01.761
There's a traitor
amongst us, boys.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.667
Someone has told
the Dutch everything.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.302
All my plans --
well, our plans --

04:08.340 --> 04:10.274
have come to naught.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.369
Today, we will die.

04:15.450 --> 04:17.714
- How can you
be so sure?

04:17.750 --> 04:21.687
- Mmm, it's the cycle
of this endless life.

04:24.230 --> 04:27.552
Aidan remembers well enough
how these things play out.

04:30.130 --> 04:31.791
So greedy.

04:32.970 --> 04:35.291
And they think
we're uncivilized.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.742
(Horn honking, siren)

04:52.090 --> 04:53.615
(Phone ringing)

04:53.660 --> 04:55.583
(Woman on PA, indistinct)

04:56.960 --> 04:58.223
- Thanks, Jason.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.850
- (Man):
Dr. Miller...

05:01.960 --> 05:03.598
- Hey...

05:04.770 --> 05:06.761
There, you.

05:10.270 --> 05:11.669
You're annoyed.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.599
You're mad.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.734
Annoyed and mad,
and you should be.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.077
I'm so sorry.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.942
- You vanished, Josh.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.641
For 2 days.
- I know.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.149
I'm beyond words sorry.
I don't know what to say.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.316
- What happened?

05:25.950 --> 05:27.258
(Chuckles)

05:27.290 --> 05:31.579
You can't tell me.
- All I can do is say that I'm...

05:31.630 --> 05:33.291
sorry...

05:34.360 --> 05:38.695
again and just pray
that you can forgive me.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.869
- I'm pregnant, Josh.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.468
- You're... pregnant?

05:46.940 --> 05:49.136
With--with my baby?
- What?

05:49.180 --> 05:51.103
- But, I...
- Who else would it be?

05:51.150 --> 05:52.618
- I don't--
- Wow, wow!

05:52.650 --> 05:55.472
And just like that, you've
turned this into clichs.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.215
The slut who gets
herself in trouble,

05:57.250 --> 05:59.287
the bastard who ducks
his responsibilities.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.810
- I didn't mean
it like that.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.521
<i>1--1ju--</i>

06:02.560 --> 06:04.881
Can we just
start over, please?

06:04.930 --> 06:09.720
- You know, I've been rehearsing
this conversation in my head for 2 days.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.330
But it never went like this.
- I'm just surprised.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.634
- Well, you know,
we shouldn't be.

06:14.670 --> 06:17.037
It was stupid of us
not to use anything!

06:17.070 --> 06:19.004
- I just thought
that I...

06:19.040 --> 06:21.077
- What, what?
What did you think, Josh?

06:21.110 --> 06:22.578
What? That I was
on the pill?

06:22.610 --> 06:25.978
Or that if something happened,
I'd take care of it?

06:26.010 --> 06:28.513
- No! No!
- I can't do this right now.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.745
- Nora, just--

06:29.790 --> 06:31.542
- I just wanted
you to know.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.753
Now, I'm gonna go back to the
version of this conversation

06:34.790 --> 06:36.383
that I was having
in my head,

06:36.430 --> 06:37.386
"cause it was much better.

06:37.430 --> 06:40.058
- Nora, don't. Nora...

06:42.730 --> 06:44.368
(Sighs)

07:02.750 --> 07:04.980
(Siren wailing in distance)

07:06.990 --> 07:09.209
- Why are you putting
yourself through this?

07:09.260 --> 07:11.126
- I owed it to Bishop.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.170
- How could you
owe him anything?

07:20.170 --> 07:22.935
Isn't ruining
your life enough?

07:22.970 --> 07:24.768
- I don't know. Maybe--

07:24.810 --> 07:27.438
Maybe I can
make things better...

07:27.480 --> 07:29.778
for all of us.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.870
- My God...

07:32.920 --> 07:35.218
You've been
here one day

07:35.250 --> 07:39.812
and you've got Kool-Aid
coming out of your ears.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.750
- Bishop wants to
take over the public

07:42.790 --> 07:44.326
so that he doesn't
have to hide.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.022
But it's his hunger that
he really needs to control.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.028
If I can teach him that
control over the urge--

07:49.060 --> 07:51.028
(Laughing)

07:52.200 --> 07:53.793
- Oh! Sorry.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.634
You're serious.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.229
- Thought you'd
appreciate a little hope.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.876
- After everything
we've been through?

08:02.010 --> 08:05.048
_ I'm tired of
disappointments, Aidan.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.479
<i>- I know.</i>

08:06.520 --> 08:07.840
(Sighs)

08:07.880 --> 08:09.848
That's why I feel like...

08:10.890 --> 08:13.018
I owe this to you.

08:13.690 --> 08:14.919
To us.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.587
- Give up on us.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.349
There's too much blood
under the bridge.

08:19.390 --> 08:21.654
And now it's
just too late.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.262
(Horns honking, siren wailing)

08:38.580 --> 08:39.979
- Hello?

08:41.250 --> 08:42.547
Guys?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.888
You get my message
about the exterminator?

08:44.920 --> 08:47.412
- Yes, you anal-retentive freak.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.657
They're gone.
Spray away.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.000
- Whoo, there's a lot
of energy in here.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.192
You can feel it right
when you walk in.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.891
- OK...

08:56.930 --> 08:59.194
That's not an exterminator.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.062
- So when did you
buy this house?

09:01.100 --> 09:02.659
- 2007.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.365
- How many spaces?

09:06.410 --> 09:08.777
- Rooms? Seven.

09:08.810 --> 09:11.302
- There's 10 if
you include closets.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.017
- No way!

09:15.220 --> 09:16.745
She's a realtor?

09:16.790 --> 09:20.385
You're gonna sell our house?
My house?

09:20.420 --> 09:22.855
And right out
from under the guys?

09:22.890 --> 09:24.927
You really are
a piece of crap.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.429
- I need to know
every space.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.690
- Look, will this
take long?

09:29.730 --> 09:31.425
- I really can't say.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.234
Every place is different.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.193
- So long as we
can move on.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.708
- Oh, Bridget!

09:36.740 --> 09:39.505
Don't move anywhere
with him! You can't!

09:39.540 --> 09:43.374
He's just trying to get you away from
everybody else. That's how it starts.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.275
- This is
where she died.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.789
- Why does she care
where I died?

09:50.820 --> 09:52.686
- Uh, do you
need anything?

09:52.720 --> 09:54.950
- No. I'm good.

09:54.990 --> 09:59.029
So what I like to do is clear
the spirits room by room.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.391
- Clear the spirits?

10:00.430 --> 10:03.559
- There's only one spirit.
- Of course! Sarah.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.023
- (All): Sally.
- Oh! Right, Sally.

10:06.070 --> 10:07.333
Sally...

10:07.370 --> 10:08.690
Well, after today,

10:08.740 --> 10:12.199
you won't have to worry
about Sally ever again.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.435
- Why?

10:13.480 --> 10:19.374
- Do you think we could move
this along, the, uh... ritual?

10:19.410 --> 10:21.174
- The exorcism.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.779
- Right.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.584
- The exorcism?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.152
- Bishop suspects something.

10:31.190 --> 10:33.659
- What kind of a leader
would he be if he didn't?

10:33.700 --> 10:35.759
- Well, if I'm
compromised with him,

10:35.800 --> 10:38.724
I wanna be sure our deal
is intact. Correct?

10:38.770 --> 10:40.363
- Was there a deal?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.710
- Well, an understanding.

10:42.740 --> 10:47.234
You handle Bishop,
and I take Boston.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.171
- You know, I find,
after a number of decades,

10:51.210 --> 10:54.248
that a certain grace
settles upon us.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.886
I'm sure you'll
find the same.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.979
I'm not sure that
death is necessary.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.455
Isn't it more important
that we restore order?

11:01.490 --> 11:02.753
- But you--

11:02.790 --> 11:05.430
- We all just want what's for
the greater good, don't we?

11:05.460 --> 11:06.757
- Is it Aidan?

11:06.800 --> 11:09.189
You wouldn't make
him leader, would you?

11:09.230 --> 11:12.939
Because with all due respect,
that would be insane.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.665
He's a heretic, a sham.

11:21.410 --> 11:24.903
- Please do not presume
that you will ever tell me

11:24.950 --> 11:27.442
anything that I do
not already know.

11:28.650 --> 11:32.245
As for the rest, all will
be discussed at the meeting.

11:33.590 --> 11:36.082
- The meeting? Of course.

11:39.390 --> 11:41.324
- Salt...

11:41.360 --> 11:45.160
binds the spirit to
the house for the ceremony.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.465
This way, they can't escape
and sneak back in later.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.366
- She's bound here
until she's gone?

11:50.410 --> 11:52.265
- Yeah, that's
how it works.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.903
- Pfft! Whatever.

12:01.650 --> 12:02.913
Son of a bitch!

12:03.950 --> 12:05.281
- It's salt?

12:05.320 --> 12:07.084
I mean, it's killer
on hardwood.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.781
Can't we use
something else?

12:08.820 --> 12:11.289
- Well, we have 2 options.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.890
You can either follow
the ceremony to the word

12:13.930 --> 12:16.922
or burn this house
to the ground.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.165
(Panting)

12:18.200 --> 12:20.567
- Out on the street.
Out on the street!

12:20.600 --> 12:22.807
- All right,
let's begin.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.399
- No!

12:27.780 --> 12:29.532
- Sally?

12:30.780 --> 12:33.772
Sally, your friends
want you to go now

12:33.820 --> 12:36.414
and find the peace
that you deserve.

12:36.450 --> 12:39.420
- What, that's all
there is to it?

12:39.450 --> 12:42.784
You ask nicely?
Because we could've done that.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.787
- Nicely, right.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.559
- Ghosts were once people.

12:46.590 --> 12:49.127
And people respond
to being asked nicely.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.367
"Please" and "thank you".

12:51.400 --> 12:53.869
I mean, that's always
my first course of action.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.265
Now...

12:57.310 --> 13:00.200
Sally, please,

13:00.240 --> 13:02.231
go find your peace.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.009
It's time.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.508
- (Bridget): Ah! Oh!

13:07.220 --> 13:08.915
Ah!

13:09.890 --> 13:12.188
- Well, this--this
might require more

13:12.220 --> 13:14.188
than "please"
and "thank you".

13:17.060 --> 13:18.687
(Coughing)

13:20.530 --> 13:23.067
- It's this
city air, filthy.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.728
- Yeah, secondhand
smoke is a killer.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.105
(Chuckles)
- How long's it been?

13:31.140 --> 13:33.677
50 years, that we
sat right here.

13:33.710 --> 13:35.132
- Who could forget?

13:35.180 --> 13:37.945
You murdered Carlo
right over there.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.243
- Carlo?

13:40.250 --> 13:41.718
Oh, yes.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.685
Let a heretic run wild
in his care, didn't he?

13:44.720 --> 13:47.610
- Well, if by heretic
you mean me, yes, he did.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.585
Youthful indiscretion,
I think we can all agree.

13:51.630 --> 13:55.828
- And what would
you call, uh, this...

13:55.860 --> 13:57.624
experiment of yours?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.334
Living with humans.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.759
Youthful indiscretion
as well?

14:03.810 --> 14:06.734
- I don't live with humans.

14:06.770 --> 14:08.408
- Is there something else?

14:09.910 --> 14:11.446
- It's come to our attention

14:11.480 --> 14:14.245
that you've been creating
a great number of children.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.578
That, furthermore,
you have a plan

14:16.620 --> 14:19.043
to turn all the right people

14:19.090 --> 14:21.513
to bring
your family public.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.050
Do you deny this?

14:23.090 --> 14:24.854
- I do not deny it.

14:24.890 --> 14:27.689
- Our laws pertaining to
the number of family members

14:27.730 --> 14:29.198
are quite clear.

14:29.230 --> 14:34.464
It keeps one clan from becoming
stronger than the others.

14:34.500 --> 14:38.903
I'm curious about
this need of yours

14:38.940 --> 14:41.079
to declare yourself
to the masses.

14:41.110 --> 14:43.374
- Would you rather us
live in the shadows?

14:43.410 --> 14:47.540
In garages and barns
for the rest of eternity?

14:47.580 --> 14:50.220
- So you would have us
take over humanity

14:50.250 --> 14:52.787
by becoming more human?

14:54.360 --> 14:58.183
And after the humans acknowledge
our existence, they what?

14:58.230 --> 15:01.154
Just... submit?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.225
- Some will.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.830
Some will need
to be persuaded.

15:05.870 --> 15:06.689
- Persuaded?

15:07.770 --> 15:12.640
Mass murder, enslavement...
- Two possibilities.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.434
- What?

15:15.680 --> 15:18.103
- We've tried to come
into the light.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.110
It's never worked,

15:21.150 --> 15:23.414
not once in our history.

15:23.450 --> 15:28.217
Your plan jeopardizes
the existence of us all.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.149
- And your plan,

15:31.190 --> 15:35.798
your theology, denies
the existence of us all.

15:35.830 --> 15:38.720
We are either the master race
or we're cowards.

15:38.770 --> 15:41.137
Why can't you and
the Council see that?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.810
- You will cull this clan
by two-thirds.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.979
You, Bishop,

15:47.010 --> 15:48.535
will come back with us.

15:48.580 --> 15:52.539
There, you will go under the
earth for no less than 50 years.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.547
Think about it. Discuss.

15:59.590 --> 16:02.753
We will take your answer
at tonight's dinner.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.056
- Take the deal.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.398
- And in my absence,
when Hegeman and his Taliban

16:11.430 --> 16:14.297
have run Boston straight back
to the Middle Ages, what then?

16:14.340 --> 16:17.469
- Boston will survive,
and so will you. Take the deal.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.830
- This isn't
about survival.

16:18.870 --> 16:20.679
It's what we've always
talked about building.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.576
You and I,
this is our dream.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.749
- We never talked
about this.

16:24.780 --> 16:28.671
If you reject the Dutch, then every family
in the Council will be after your head.

16:38.590 --> 16:41.150
(Man speaking on PA,
indistinct)

17:02.750 --> 17:04.444
- Nora...

17:05.690 --> 17:08.819
You--you had the...

17:10.829 --> 17:12.423
Oh my God!

17:12.460 --> 17:14.690
- I told them to get you.

17:14.730 --> 17:17.722
Nobody called?
- No.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.459
Is it...

17:22.640 --> 17:24.233
Is he healthy?

17:24.270 --> 17:26.967
- I can't get the little bugger
to latch on just yet,

17:27.010 --> 17:28.478
but he's perfect.

17:28.510 --> 17:30.376
(Sighs)

17:31.980 --> 17:33.209
(Baby cooing)

17:33.250 --> 17:34.740
Daddy's here.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.355
- No!

17:43.390 --> 17:45.552
No, no, no!

17:45.590 --> 17:47.422
No! Ah!

17:49.830 --> 17:52.265
- God, our Father,

17:52.300 --> 17:57.101
cleanse this place of the
dark remnant dwelling within

17:57.140 --> 18:00.599
and fill it with
light and love.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.473
Be gone unclean spirit.

18:03.510 --> 18:07.777
Leave this world for those
who still live in it.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.242
God, our Father...

18:09.280 --> 18:10.679
(Groaning)

18:10.720 --> 18:15.510
...Cleanse this place of
the dark, dark remnant.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.709
Fill it with light.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.524
- Why are you doing this?

18:18.560 --> 18:21.200
I left you alone!
You won!

18:21.230 --> 18:22.322
(Sally grunting)

18:22.360 --> 18:24.124
- God, our Father...

18:25.000 --> 18:29.836
remove all power
from this lost spirit.

18:29.870 --> 18:34.137
Power of this lost spirit.
(Panting)

18:34.180 --> 18:37.241
Lost spirit. Lost, lost...

18:37.280 --> 18:38.805
(Screaming)

18:38.850 --> 18:42.013
Leave this world for those
who still live in it.

18:42.050 --> 18:44.348
(Screaming)

18:50.090 --> 18:51.524
(Phone ringing)

18:51.560 --> 18:55.098
- (Man on PA): Dr. Johnson,
pick up Line 1, please.

18:55.130 --> 18:56.325
- Aidan!

18:57.930 --> 18:59.898
Hey!

18:59.930 --> 19:02.399
(Sighs)
You're here.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.933
- Yeah, I've gotta
keep up appearances.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.301
- Right, yeah.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.707
I mean, you still
work here, all right?

19:09.740 --> 19:11.299
It's there you have
to keep up appearances.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.980
That's, like, a show. Like a
one night only kind of thing, right?

19:15.020 --> 19:17.318
Right? So...

19:18.420 --> 19:19.979
So how is, uh...

19:20.020 --> 19:22.910
How is everything over
there with--with them?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.758
- Everything's everything.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.781
- It's everything, sure.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.128
So, are you coming back
to the house or...

19:29.160 --> 19:30.559
- I don't know.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.999
- Will you know?

19:32.030 --> 19:33.737
- Josh, I don't know!

19:35.070 --> 19:36.538
- OK.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.934
- You all right?

19:41.980 --> 19:44.540
- I'm just concerned
about you, really.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.475
And, no,
I'm not all right.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.310
Nora's pregnant.

19:53.690 --> 19:55.089
- Wait, with your...

19:55.120 --> 19:56.383
- I think so.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.252
Yeah, and I'm sure
you already know this.

19:58.290 --> 20:00.019
But, you know,
that question,

20:00.060 --> 20:04.224
like, the worst thing that you can
ask a woman when she announces.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.965
- Wait, you didn't
ask that did you?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.126
- Oh!

20:07.170 --> 20:10.060
- I didn't think a guy
like me could have a kid.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.400
- Yeah, me neither! Josh...

20:13.440 --> 20:14.475
Whoa!

20:14.510 --> 20:16.672
Uh-huh. Wow!

20:16.710 --> 20:19.270
- Yeah. Right?

20:20.780 --> 20:22.373
So what do you think?

20:24.350 --> 20:25.886
- Congratulations.

20:27.220 --> 20:29.257
- Congratulations?
No, thank you.

20:29.290 --> 20:31.554
No, I'm not looking
for a cigar, man.

20:31.590 --> 20:34.696
I need help, OK? I--I
need. What do I do?

20:34.730 --> 20:37.153
- Josh, I realize
that you're freaking out.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.565
But listen,
this is good.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.069
Hell, this is better
than good. This is normal.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.465
- It doesn't
feel normal, OK?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.901
If it were normal, I'd be running
around telling friends, family,

20:44.940 --> 20:47.136
people in line
at Starbucks,

20:47.170 --> 20:49.400
not pacing the hall
trying to figure out

20:49.440 --> 20:51.374
how to tactfully
bring up an abortion.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.970
- Wait a second. Did you
actually have that conversation?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.011
- No, I didn't think it'd
be a very good follow-up to:

20:56.050 --> 20:58.018
"Are you sure
that's my kid?"

20:59.350 --> 21:01.079
But it just feels wrong.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.684
I mean, what if it's
like me? What if it's...

21:05.730 --> 21:08.097
What if it's just like me?

21:09.530 --> 21:11.225
- I don't know.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.137
But before you talk about
doing anything drastic,

21:14.170 --> 21:15.433
think about this:

21:15.470 --> 21:17.564
You and me...

21:18.610 --> 21:19.862
(Sighs)

21:19.910 --> 21:23.232
We agreed to make a go
at having a real life.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.645
- Yeah.
- Right?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.273
- I know we did.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.381
- Looks like one of
us is gonna get a shot.

21:50.510 --> 21:53.070
- Isn't this always the way?

21:53.110 --> 21:58.002
They roll out the red carpet
and sweep us right under it.

21:59.980 --> 22:03.814
- I thought you'd firmly secured
your place amongst the Chosen.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.045
(Chuckles)

22:05.090 --> 22:08.310
- There is no security.
You should know that.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.682
Not when you're a mistake,
like you and I.

22:17.730 --> 22:20.324
Excuse my honesty.

22:20.370 --> 22:21.929
I, uh...

22:21.970 --> 22:24.166
I'm in a mood.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.907
- Because Aidan's back?

22:34.320 --> 22:40.384
How is the world's most loyal
bootlicker possibly a mistake?

22:40.420 --> 22:44.687
- Well, they were
coming for my brother.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.051
Bishop and his men,

22:48.100 --> 22:50.626
riding high from
the slaughter in Concord,

22:50.670 --> 22:55.335
drunk on blood and
thirsty for more.

22:55.370 --> 22:58.704
I came outside when
I heard them in the barn.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.178
They were already on him.

23:02.210 --> 23:05.771
- That's... awful.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.517
(Chuckling)

23:08.620 --> 23:11.510
- I hated my brother.

23:14.790 --> 23:18.090
He put up fight,
and Bishop liked that.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.997
Yeah, Silas was a soldier.

23:21.030 --> 23:24.864
I'd avoided the war and stayed
home to pursue my studies.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.665
- So how did
they get you?

23:28.840 --> 23:32.333
- Well, Silas wanted
to die with honour,

23:32.370 --> 23:34.429
not as a monster, so...

23:35.780 --> 23:38.044
he took his dagger
and slit his own throat.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.347
But Bishop wouldn't
go home empty-handed.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.348
That left him with me.
I would do.

23:46.290 --> 23:48.509
Soon after that,
he got Aidan,

23:48.560 --> 23:52.224
the good little soldier
he'd been looking for.

23:53.830 --> 23:55.889
So you see...

23:56.600 --> 23:58.762
we're just pawns,
you and I.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.063
Who do you think killed
Bernie's little bullies?

24:15.350 --> 24:17.819
- So it was your fault,

24:17.850 --> 24:19.784
what happened to Bernie?

24:19.820 --> 24:23.256
- We've just been put
here as stepping stones

24:23.290 --> 24:25.486
to get him back what
he really wanted.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.157
Aidan.

24:27.190 --> 24:30.160
Pathetic, if you ask me.
He's a coward and a traitor.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.659
- Aren't you betraying Bishop
right now, talking this way?

24:33.700 --> 24:35.429
(Laughing)

24:40.270 --> 24:43.433
- We should help
each other, you and 1.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.347
Don't you see that we're
closer than you knew.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.170
- Give me space, Marcus.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.841
I'm in a mood.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.256
(Door opening)

24:57.290 --> 24:59.179
- This is it.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.625
Are you two ready?

25:02.660 --> 25:04.890
- Yeah. I don't know.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.329
It feels
like it's working.

25:06.370 --> 25:08.793
Doesn't it feel
like it's working?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.069
- It does, yeah.

25:11.910 --> 25:15.232
- Bridget, please...

25:15.280 --> 25:18.545
- God, our Father--
- Stop.

25:18.580 --> 25:19.604
Wait.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.744
- What are you doing?

25:21.780 --> 25:23.680
- What will
happen to her?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.484
Will she go to Heaven?

25:25.520 --> 25:26.646
(Chuckles)

25:26.690 --> 25:28.988
- Honestly,
I don't know, honey.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.090
- You don't know?

25:30.120 --> 25:31.724
- We only have the ability

25:31.760 --> 25:33.797
to get the energy
out of a space.

25:33.830 --> 25:36.549
Where they go or
what they become,

25:36.600 --> 25:38.398
it's unknown to me.

25:38.430 --> 25:40.660
- I don't know about this.
- Seriously?

25:46.310 --> 25:47.903
This whole deal
was your idea.

25:47.940 --> 25:51.547
- What if she's clinging to
this house, to us, for a reason?

25:51.580 --> 25:53.309
- This isn't her
house anymore!

25:53.350 --> 25:56.115
- She's safe here. What if
we send her somewhere bad?

25:56.150 --> 25:58.642
- Send her somewhere bad?
We're the ones in Hell!

25:58.690 --> 26:01.716
I mean, every conversation
we have turns to Sally.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.909
Whenever the wind blows,

26:02.960 --> 26:05.224
you think Sally's whispering
something to you.

26:05.260 --> 26:08.628
I mean, every night, you think
she's watching us sleep.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.424
(Wheezing)

26:10.460 --> 26:13.634
- I just think maybe
Sally deserves more.

26:13.670 --> 26:15.764
- We deserve more.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.931
Don't we?

26:21.840 --> 26:24.309
You have to finish this.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.640
- God, our Father...
(Sally groaning)

26:28.680 --> 26:32.480
...Cleanse this place of the
dark spirit dwelling within

26:32.520 --> 26:36.855
and fill it with
light and love.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.391
- Well, gentlemen...

26:44.700 --> 26:47.067
I hope you brought
your appetites.

26:50.870 --> 26:51.940
Did I mention here

26:51.970 --> 26:54.280
that Michelle is
pregnant with twins?

26:54.310 --> 26:56.506
Don't be shy. Dig in!

26:56.540 --> 27:00.374
She's been compelled SO we
can enjoy our little delicacy in peace.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.674
- It's your decision, Bishop.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.748
Is this meal a celebration
of your good judgement

27:06.790 --> 27:09.009
or a memorial
to your stupidity?

27:09.060 --> 27:10.414
- My decision...

27:12.260 --> 27:13.580
Yes.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.553
Well...

27:16.600 --> 27:18.819
business before pleasure,
I assume.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.497
I'd like to make a toast.

27:20.530 --> 27:21.736
- Wait!

27:31.050 --> 27:32.802
Nobody wants a war.

27:32.850 --> 27:35.569
Not against humanity,
not amongst the families.

27:35.620 --> 27:39.045
If Bishop would
revise his ambitions,

27:39.090 --> 27:40.489
if he would
scale them back,

27:40.520 --> 27:43.490
then you could truthfully
report to the Council

27:43.520 --> 27:44.726
that he submitted
to your demands

27:44.760 --> 27:46.626
while leaving a flawed,

27:46.660 --> 27:50.324
but capable leader
here in Boston.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.690
And if that's not enough,
then you can take me.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.663
I'm the true heretic.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.634
If I were to submit
to punishment...

28:02.210 --> 28:03.336
that might be enough.

28:03.380 --> 28:08.011
- And since Aidan is so
selflessly willing to submit,

28:08.050 --> 28:11.941
maybe Bishop would agree
to some sort of power share.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.358
Something to make the Council
feel more at ease.

28:16.490 --> 28:17.821
(Chuckles)

28:17.860 --> 28:19.919
- Well, gentlemen...

28:21.500 --> 28:25.391
I do believe you've just heard
the clarion call of surrender,

28:25.430 --> 28:27.899
which is kind of funny.

28:27.940 --> 28:32.537
Because I was going to stand up
here and tell you that I reject your offer.

28:32.570 --> 28:35.107
I reject your theology.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.199
I reject your cowardice.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.106
And I was prepared
to stand up here

28:39.150 --> 28:40.504
and fight you
for what was right.

28:40.550 --> 28:43.645
But I cannot do that alone.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.548
And now it seems I stand
here more alone than ever.

28:47.590 --> 28:49.388
My sons...

28:50.760 --> 28:53.229
in their own way,
have rejected me...

28:54.430 --> 28:58.219
lost faith in me,
deserted me.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.999
Well...
(Clears throat)

29:00.030 --> 29:03.398
These things happen,
and so, a new toast.

29:09.940 --> 29:14.047
Mmm, forgive my heedlessness.
I accept your terms.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.570
I surrender.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.145
My family will be reduced.

29:17.180 --> 29:19.182
Boston is yours.
Let's celebrate.

29:25.290 --> 29:26.849
(Coughing)

29:30.230 --> 29:32.221
Mmm...

29:35.540 --> 29:37.736
What's the matter?
Did you guys eat already?

29:37.770 --> 29:39.363
Come on! Celebrate!

29:39.410 --> 29:42.471
I rolled over, tail between
my legs, etc., etc.

29:42.510 --> 29:45.104
(Coughing)

29:45.150 --> 29:47.403
You don't look
so good, old friend.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.582
Oh! You know
what I bet it was?

29:52.620 --> 29:54.213
Lola.

29:55.890 --> 29:59.281
Yeah. That pretty little
thing from the blood den.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.627
I probably
should've told you

30:00.660 --> 30:03.129
she was on a steady
diet of juniper.

30:04.330 --> 30:06.128
(Women screaming)

30:06.170 --> 30:07.990
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

30:08.040 --> 30:10.668
all the donors have
been noshing on the stuff.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.532
Nasty stuff, that juniper.

30:13.770 --> 30:17.900
Really slow-acting,
but once it kicks in,

30:17.950 --> 30:20.874
it really packs a wallop.

30:22.050 --> 30:26.089
Everything in the body
constricts and stiffens.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.509
They say it's a lot
like rigor mortis.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.686
The effects
don't last too long,

30:29.720 --> 30:33.327
but I only need a couple
of minutes to enjoy this.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.725
- Help.

30:36.200 --> 30:39.397
Oh, they're not gonna
help you. Those two?

30:39.430 --> 30:40.932
Useless, trust me.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.199
- Bishop, think about this.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.937
- If you only drank a little
from the donors, you'd be fine.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.462
But no, you had
to follow the old ways

30:47.510 --> 30:49.478
and suck them dry.

30:49.510 --> 30:51.979
Hey, I'm not judging.

30:52.010 --> 30:55.640
I understand where you're
coming from. Traditions work.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.239
And as the
saying goes:

30:57.280 --> 31:00.318
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

31:00.350 --> 31:02.455
But there is
another saying:

31:02.490 --> 31:04.026
Change or die.

31:04.660 --> 31:06.025
- Bishop!

31:06.830 --> 31:08.958
(Thump)

31:11.800 --> 31:14.531
- Did you really think
I didn't have a plan?

31:14.570 --> 31:19.565
You may be older, but you don't
have the market cornered on wisdom.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.006
** You saw in me
and my hands *

31:26.050 --> 31:28.212
* Things you were missing *

31:30.350 --> 31:32.114
* 1 become *

31:33.190 --> 31:35.113
* Dead in December... *

31:39.190 --> 31:41.329
- Marcus don't be a fool.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.030
(Coughing)

31:44.070 --> 31:45.959
- By killing Hegeman
and the idiot

31:46.000 --> 31:47.968
who tried to
help him escape?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.367
Bishop will be so pleased.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.903
- Marcus you could
come with us.

31:52.940 --> 31:55.307
- Yeah, because we're
so close, you and I.

31:55.340 --> 31:58.048
Don't worry.
- Oh!

31:59.810 --> 32:03.747
- I'll tell your friends you
died screaming like a pig.

32:07.450 --> 32:10.010
*I'm*

32:10.060 --> 32:11.858
* High in the summer *

32:13.190 --> 32:14.624
- Let's go!

32:15.630 --> 32:17.120
Let's go!

32:20.730 --> 32:22.767
* 1 become *

32:22.800 --> 32:25.132
* Dead in December **

32:26.070 --> 32:27.606
- This was our bedroom.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.850
We were half-joking, but we always
said this was where we'd make our family.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.200
- No.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.072
- She wanted that more
than anything in the world.

32:39.150 --> 32:41.084
Now I can never
give her that.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.020
I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

32:45.060 --> 32:47.859
- You have to finish this.

32:47.890 --> 32:50.621
I can't take much more.

32:50.660 --> 32:54.164
- You don't get to talk
about me like that.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.759
You don't get
to mourn me!

32:55.800 --> 32:57.837
- Be gone unclean spirit.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.907
Leave this world
for those who still---

33:00.940 --> 33:02.032
- NO!

33:02.080 --> 33:04.401
(Screaming)

33:04.450 --> 33:05.849
- It was too
crappy for you.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.006
- You know I
love that ring.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.711
- Then where
the hell is it!

33:08.750 --> 33:10.912
- I told you, it fell!

33:10.950 --> 33:12.088
Oh!

33:14.560 --> 33:15.982
- Oh!

33:19.530 --> 33:20.588
- What happened?

33:21.560 --> 33:24.860
Is it done? Is she gone?
- Alannah?

33:24.900 --> 33:26.197
Are you OK?

33:27.100 --> 33:28.864
- Alannah?

33:28.900 --> 33:30.061
<i>- You!</i>

33:31.810 --> 33:33.562
You did this to me.

33:34.340 --> 33:36.434
- No, Sally, no.
I didn't mean to.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.039
- How could you
do this to me?

33:38.080 --> 33:39.878
- It was an accident,
you bitch!

33:39.910 --> 33:42.379
- I HATE YOU!
- Why won't you just die?

33:42.420 --> 33:44.240
- Danny, stop it!

33:44.290 --> 33:48.113
- I'm gonna fix it
right now!

33:51.260 --> 33:52.421
Ah!

33:54.860 --> 33:56.624
(Gasping)

33:57.360 --> 33:58.464
(Coughing)

33:58.500 --> 34:02.038
- Oh God,
are you OK? Alannah?

34:04.740 --> 34:06.230
<i>- You!</i>

34:06.910 --> 34:08.775
I know what you are.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.985
(Siren wailing in distance)

34:24.560 --> 34:26.983
- Wait! You have
to finish the job.

34:27.030 --> 34:28.520
We already paid.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.996
- Here, here, here!
Here's your stupid money!

34:32.030 --> 34:34.431
- Wait, what about Sally?
What happened to her?

34:35.639 --> 34:38.803
- I don't know,
but I hope she's still here.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.036
She deserves this place.

34:42.239 --> 34:43.969
And you...

34:45.080 --> 34:47.071
You deserve whatever
she does to you.

34:47.110 --> 34:50.774
- No, no, Sally's a liar. She just
can't stand for us to be happy.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.379
- No.

34:52.420 --> 34:56.050
The dead don't lie.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.829
- No, Bridget,
don't do this.

35:03.860 --> 35:04.361
(Door slamming)

35:05.600 --> 35:08.900
- Get out of my way.
- You can't just leave me like this!

35:10.240 --> 35:12.368
- I won't tell anyone.

35:13.210 --> 35:14.575
They won't even
believe me.

35:14.610 --> 35:17.272
- What? You think I'd
do something to you?

35:17.310 --> 35:19.039
You know that's
not who I am.

35:20.010 --> 35:21.569
- Please, let me go.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.115
Let me go!

35:39.430 --> 35:41.467
I'm sorry, Sally.

36:00.990 --> 36:02.515
(Phone ringing)

36:16.570 --> 36:19.505
- So, I want to
apologize again.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.271
- You ever say or hear
something so many times that

36:22.310 --> 36:23.380
the words
lose all meaning?

36:23.410 --> 36:25.299
- Can we talk?

36:26.110 --> 36:28.579
I'm, like, begging.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.076
(Dropping charts)

36:31.120 --> 36:32.713
- Hurry up.

36:32.750 --> 36:34.912
I've got tons of
guys to sleep with.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.314
- That's not what
I meant when I said that.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.182
- Really? What could
you have meant?

36:39.230 --> 36:40.857
(Sighs)

36:42.130 --> 36:45.794
- I didn't think I could
get anyone pregnant.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.367
(Baby crying in distance)

36:48.400 --> 36:52.530
I've got-- I have problems,
like, deep genetic-level problems.

36:52.570 --> 36:55.505
And I didn't think I could.

36:57.140 --> 36:59.108
That's what that meant.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.370
And it's not just me.

37:03.420 --> 37:07.414
My whole... family's
screwed up, so...

37:08.460 --> 37:09.814
(Sighing)

37:09.860 --> 37:11.749
- That's your
big confession?

37:11.790 --> 37:14.157
God, Josh,
whose family isn't?

37:14.190 --> 37:15.749
- Yeah, I know,
but really--

37:15.800 --> 37:18.053
- I swore that I would
never have children.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.295
My God, my family...

37:21.340 --> 37:23.490
Things aren't right.

37:23.540 --> 37:27.568
Addiction, mental
illness, violence...

37:28.580 --> 37:31.174
I'm always so careful
with protection.

37:31.210 --> 37:34.419
I'm paranoid, actually.

37:35.780 --> 37:39.387
But that night with you...

37:39.420 --> 37:42.253
I don't know.
There was something about it.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.220
Something different.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.254
And it wasn't just
that you jumped me

37:48.300 --> 37:50.120
and it was over
in 20 seconds.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.594
(Laughing)

37:53.070 --> 37:55.562
- Yeah, I think
it was at least 30.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.090
(Chuckles)

38:00.910 --> 38:05.370
- I can't blame you
for being freaked.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.947
I'm not sure I have
it in me either.

38:07.980 --> 38:10.745
- I just want you
to know that I'm not...

38:11.850 --> 38:13.443
going anywhere.

38:13.490 --> 38:18.052
- Well, we don't have to decide
right now though, right? It's still early.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.580
- Totally.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.928
- I'm glad you don't
think I'm a slut.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.493
(Laughing)

38:37.080 --> 38:38.673
(Panting)

38:39.580 --> 38:40.775
- I'm all right.

38:40.810 --> 38:42.414
All right, let go.
Let go.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.214
(Coughing)

38:44.250 --> 38:46.742
- Are you sure?
- I'm healing already, yeah.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.052
I have to get back.

38:50.890 --> 38:53.382
- You tell them
what you saw here.

38:53.430 --> 38:56.593
Oh! He needs
to be stopped.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.197
- Listen to me.

39:00.270 --> 39:01.795
Prepare.

39:02.670 --> 39:04.729
Prepare for
what's coming.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.033
(Exhaling sharply)

39:14.180 --> 39:16.239
- You think he'll
make it back?

39:17.450 --> 39:18.611
- Maybe.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.709
(Groaning)

39:20.750 --> 39:22.252
Probably.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.897
You had pretty impeccable
timing back there.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.908
- He had it coming.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.772
You know Marcus was
responsible for the bullies?

39:46.250 --> 39:50.574
- I don't know why I didn't
assume that in the first place.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.645
- You need to be careful.

39:52.690 --> 39:57.150
Whatever Bishop's thinking,
it's obviously well planned.

39:58.760 --> 40:02.128
Why would you offer
to go underground?

40:04.200 --> 40:08.091
- It's because everything I've
done here has been a mistake.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.878
- I don't think
I was so bad.

40:24.180 --> 40:25.841
- Of course you weren't.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.557
None of this has
ever been your fault.

40:29.590 --> 40:31.319
<i>- I know.</i>

40:33.060 --> 40:36.052
It's all been
out of my control...

40:37.630 --> 40:38.961
until now.

40:47.510 --> 40:48.807
- No, no. Rebecca, no.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.569
- I'm not meant
to be like this.

40:50.610 --> 40:53.045
Like you and Bishop.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.645
That night when
you were with me...

40:58.420 --> 41:00.343
I was supposed to die.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.755
I am dead.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.650
It's not right
that I'm here.

41:06.690 --> 41:08.727
- I can't do this to you.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.797
- Aidan...

41:10.830 --> 41:14.130
I swear that
I will do it myself.

41:14.170 --> 41:16.468
- Rebecca, we're gonna
get out of here.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.093
- You have to let me go.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.268
I killed Marcus.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.438
But I'm not gonna
let them win.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.445
At least give me the dignity
to do this myself,

41:26.480 --> 41:27.970
before they can.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.219
You always said you
didn't want this for me.

41:34.250 --> 41:35.957
- I didn't.

41:35.990 --> 41:37.389
- So...

41:38.930 --> 41:41.353
if you loved me

41:41.390 --> 41:45.566
even for a second of
this horrible ride...

41:47.270 --> 41:49.796
you would let me go.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.802
- OK, well, then
I'm going with you.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.774
- No, no.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.118
You have to finish this.

42:06.420 --> 42:10.960
** She waltzes on the city *

42:12.090 --> 42:15.355
* The rooftops and raindrops *

42:15.400 --> 42:18.222
* Wet and all spent *

42:19.730 --> 42:24.429
* And I thought I had you... *

42:24.470 --> 42:26.029
Please.

42:26.070 --> 42:29.779
* Where I don't want you *

42:31.810 --> 42:35.713
* When you arrived *

42:36.750 --> 42:38.809
* I knew you'd be next... *

42:42.320 --> 42:43.981
OK.

42:50.030 --> 42:51.293
Thank you.

42:51.330 --> 42:52.968
(Sobbing)

42:53.000 --> 42:56.595
* Stop all the curses *

42:57.840 --> 43:01.799
* Numbing curses *

43:03.340 --> 43:06.207
* So hard to see *

43:06.250 --> 43:10.118
* When he's used up her mind *

43:11.220 --> 43:16.249
* And I thought I had you *

43:17.720 --> 43:21.827
* Where I don't want you *

43:23.260 --> 43:27.527
* When you arrived *

43:27.570 --> 43:31.063
* I knew you'd be next **
