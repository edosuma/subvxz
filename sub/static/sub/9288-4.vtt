00:23.991 --> 00:25.993
Are you stupid? What are
you doing in the street?

00:26.494 --> 00:27.978
What are you, an idiot?

01:19.830 --> 01:20.831
No!

01:21.832 --> 01:24.051
- Keep moving!
- No!

01:33.227 --> 01:34.478
Come on, get her!

01:37.815 --> 01:39.116
Shut up!

01:39.316 --> 01:41.318
Put her down.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.156
Keep moving.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.857
Shut up! Let's go. Keep going.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.109
Help me.

01:57.251 --> 02:00.004
- We have to go back.
- There's no point, she's dead.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.455
- You don't know that.
- Get in!

02:01.655 --> 02:02.673
Take it easy!

02:03.040 --> 02:05.125
Know what, you better decide
whose side you're on.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.511
We can't leave her in the
middle of the street.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.966
Nina.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.976
Nina, I know you're upset.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.478
Of course I'm upset, Jack.
What do you expect?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.280
I'm sorry.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.984
The reason why I had to leave the office
is because I got a call from Walsh.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.486
He was meeting another one
of our agents. Scott Baylor.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.988
- He said he had evidence that
- That led you to me.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.491
I know, Jack, but you should
have thought it through.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.493
Nina, listen to me.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.462
Richard Walsh is dead.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.048
What?

02:44.248 --> 02:46.750
He was shot. I watched him die.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.854
What is going on?

02:50.054 --> 02:51.856
He was killed because he had proof...

02:52.056 --> 02:55.426
...that people from our own agency
are behind the hit on Palmer.

02:55.626 --> 02:57.978
- Who?
- I don't know yet.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.681
Right before Richard died,
he gave me that keycard.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.102
I'm hoping that's going to tell us.
Jamey's trying to break it down now.

03:05.302 --> 03:08.439
- You trust Jamey?
- He did. I trust you.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.375
Which means the three of us
have to work together.

03:11.575 --> 03:15.529
From this point forward, we have to
assume that we can trust nobody else.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.950
- I understand.
- Good.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.255
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

03:24.455 --> 03:28.459
Work the card with Jamey.
I have to make a call.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.601
Thank you.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.887
Senator, Agent Pierce wanted to talk
to you as soon as you got back.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.172
Fine. Just give me a minute.

03:41.372 --> 03:43.374
It's important, there's a security issue.

03:43.574 --> 03:44.375
A minute!

03:51.065 --> 03:52.333
- Yeah.
- Did you find anything out yet?

03:52.533 --> 03:55.536
David, it's barely been half an hour
since you told me about it.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.006
Carl, I need you to find out
the source of this story.

03:58.106 --> 03:59.690
Not first thing in the morning. Now!

03:59.790 --> 04:02.253
I understand, but this can't be
done over the phone.

04:02.293 --> 04:03.794
I have to talk to some people in person.

04:04.295 --> 04:06.547
It's five after three.
I want to hear something by 4:00.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.549
David, you've got to let me...

04:13.971 --> 04:16.707
- Where were you?
- I went for a drive.

04:16.906 --> 04:19.151
A drive. Alone, at this time of night?

04:19.351 --> 04:21.595
I just needed to get away for a while.

04:21.795 --> 04:22.763
Away from what, David?

04:26.684 --> 04:27.685
Everything.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.488
Wait a minute.
They haven't told you, have they?

04:31.855 --> 04:34.274
There has been an assassination threat.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.194
That's what all the fuss is about?

04:37.394 --> 04:38.195
Yes.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.533
I thought it was something serious.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.961
Jack.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.964
I'm screening the passenger list,
something doesn't add up.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.766
- What?
- 2B

04:58.966 --> 05:00.467
Manifest shows an empty seat.

05:00.968 --> 05:01.769
So?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.470
According to the ticketing file...

05:03.971 --> 05:06.473
...first class was full,
plus there is a waiting list.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.475
Why would the plane take
off with an empty seat?

05:08.976 --> 05:09.777
Doesn't make sense.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.278
This is good, let's work it.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.480
- What time does Rayburn get in?
- 6:00.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.482
Then wake him up, bring him in now.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.483
Jack.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.491
We've got something off the keycard.

05:24.691 --> 05:25.676
The encryption is complex.

05:25.876 --> 05:29.046
I've asked Jamey to isolate sectors
and she's managed to extract one.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.464
Just part of one, actually.

05:30.881 --> 05:34.218
That's it, just an address. What's
that got to do with Palmer?

05:34.418 --> 05:35.436
It doesn't say.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.588
Crosscheck it with his
schedule for tomorrow.

05:37.788 --> 05:39.190
He's not going anywhere near it.

05:39.390 --> 05:42.226
Has he been anywhere near it
since he came to Los Angeles?

05:42.726 --> 05:44.028
No.

05:44.228 --> 05:46.897
How about previous visits, connection
to family members, associates, anything?

05:47.097 --> 05:48.566
I can check. It will take time.

05:48.766 --> 05:51.235
No. Let's see what we can
peel off. Start in here.

05:56.407 --> 05:58.275
Still just the address on San Fernando Road.

05:58.776 --> 06:02.279
How long is it going to take to access
the next level? Minutes or hours?

06:02.479 --> 06:05.199
- Hours most likely.
- We don't have hours.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.668
I'll check out the address myself.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.256
- You want some backup?
- No. I need you here.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.846
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.715
Suddenly I can't access
our decryption software.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.720
Phones are down, too.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.606
It's a lockdown.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.948
It's Mason. Hide the keycard.

06:39.450 --> 06:41.034
NI'll handle this.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.381
Hello, Nina.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.384
These men are with Internal Investigations.
You are now on official lockdown.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.721
- On what authority?
- District Office.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.557
Trying to stop an assassination, George.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.260
Can't you find anything
better to do than this?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.062
Two agents died tonight.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.181
Lockdown is standard procedure
until we get some answers.

07:12.182 --> 07:12.683
Where's Jack?

07:13.183 --> 07:14.017
I don't know.

07:20.991 --> 07:22.826
Station 2, coming your way.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.725
Lockdown, nobody leaves.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.960
- Lockdown, are you serious?
- No, I'm kidding.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.596
I gotta get some work from my car.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.397
You know the drill.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.015
Fine, you take the keys.

08:01.298 --> 08:05.085
All right, I assume you're all familiar
with lockdown procedures.

08:05.285 --> 08:09.080
You remain in the building. All
communications will be monitored.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.876
Any incoming call without secure
access codes will be blocked.

08:13.076 --> 08:18.081
In the meantime, you can continue to work on
systems available to you 'til notified otherwise.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.233
Anyone currently assigned...

08:20.433 --> 08:22.085
Who called them in, Tony. You?

08:22.586 --> 08:24.087
Yeah. Me.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.889
Why?

08:26.089 --> 08:28.091
Somebody had to. Jack's out of control.

08:28.291 --> 08:29.893
Meaning what?

08:30.093 --> 08:32.511
Two agents are down, Jack was
there when it happened.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.207
You can't believe he had
anything to do with that.

08:36.408 --> 08:39.615
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to believe.

08:39.815 --> 08:43.023
I'd hate to think this has
anything to do with me.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.324
You think what you want.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.694
All right, get comfortable,
could be here for quite a while.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.563
He got past me.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.354
All right, Nina, where'd he go?

08:57.554 --> 08:59.957
I already told you, I don't know.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.628
As soon as you tell me, we can
get things up and running.

09:04.828 --> 09:07.714
I'm really sorry, George,
I can't help you out.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.716
Me, too.

09:26.683 --> 09:29.186
Senator, could I have a word with you?

09:37.661 --> 09:40.914
I'm not sure you appreciate
the seriousness of this threat.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.750
I get serious threats every
morning with my orange juice.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.169
With all due respect,
this one's different.

09:46.369 --> 09:47.871
It's a pro from overseas.

09:49.373 --> 09:51.675
- Who's behind it?
- We don't know.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.393
But as I'm sure you're aware...

09:53.593 --> 09:58.181
...an airliner exploded about an hour and
a half ago outside LA. No survivors.

09:58.381 --> 10:00.467
Are you saying there's some connection?

10:00.667 --> 10:01.268
Again, we don't know.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.021
- We're looking into it.
- What do we know?

10:04.221 --> 10:09.026
That these are serious people,
and they want you dead, today.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.124
What about my family?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.126
The threat appears to be against you only.

10:26.326 --> 10:29.880
But, of course, we'll increase
security for your family as well.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.683
The main thing is your schedule.

10:32.883 --> 10:36.169
Today is Primary Day, I'm not
gonna hide in my hotel room.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.472
Understood. But we are
recommending some changes.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.198
The breakfast, for example.

10:40.398 --> 10:41.725
The breakfast is important.

10:41.925 --> 10:45.512
The top labor leaders in the
state are going to be there.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.647
We're trying to keep you alive, Senator.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.933
And I'm trying to win an election.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.207
Mom said you wanted to see me.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.160
Wanted to make sure you're all right.
What are you doing up?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.163
If I'm not sleeping by
3:00, I'm not sleeping.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.199
Actually, I was gonna watch
some tube, you wanna join me?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.285
Is anything on this time of night?

11:08.485 --> 11:09.786
Nothing good.

11:10.287 --> 11:11.788
I guess I'll pass.

11:15.292 --> 11:17.594
Heard about the threat.

11:17.794 --> 11:21.047
Don't worry about it.
They'll take good care of me.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.849
They better.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.770
Better get some rest.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.011
I'm telling you, we have to
go back and get Janet.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.713
Are you gonna tell your girlfriend
to shut her mouth or not?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.766
She's probably dead, there's no point.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.635
And what if she's not?
She might need help.

12:01.838 --> 12:04.090
Why do always do what he tells you?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.560
Why don't you think for yourself?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.094
Just leave it alone, okay.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.597
I can't, she's my friend.

12:27.664 --> 12:31.168
You know, she may be right after all.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.471
We should go back.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.948
If she's alive, she can I.D. us.

12:37.148 --> 12:39.426
We have to shut her up for good.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.596
What? What are you saying?

12:42.796 --> 12:46.016
You're gonna kill Janet?
Is that what you're gonna do?

12:46.216 --> 12:48.485
Be quiet! Close her mouth! Now!

12:48.685 --> 12:52.105
I'm not gonna let you
tie me up. Let me out.

12:54.891 --> 12:57.394
Sounds like she's gonna tie you up.

12:57.594 --> 12:59.112
Shut up!

13:10.574 --> 13:12.492
I just hope the girls are still there.

13:26.590 --> 13:28.058
Oh, no.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.645
I don't believe this.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.941
Stay in your car, sir. Back in the car.

13:53.141 --> 13:55.752
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.091
Do you have any idea
how fast you were going?

14:01.424 --> 14:03.677
Yes. Officer, our daughters are missing.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.513
We got a phone call, we are on our way
to pick them up. Please.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.215
- Can I see your license and registration?
- Did you hear what I said?

14:09.415 --> 14:11.485
Your license and registration, please.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.688
I'm Teri Bauer, he's telling the
truth. We really could use your help here.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.207
My daughter just phoned
from Platt's Auto Body.

14:17.407 --> 14:19.726
Different last names.
One's married, one's not.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.528
Out together in the middle of the night.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.564
I called 911 fifteen minutes
ago, verify it if you want.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.066
You know what, I'm gonna do that.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.567
Yeah, why don't you do that.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.792
All right.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.963
Hey, listen, I asked you
to remain in the car.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.464
I understand that.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.184
Can we speed things up? Write us
tickets, we'll be on our way.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.721
The woman asked me to verify the 911.
That's what I'm trying to do.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.559
You know, You are a real piece
of work, you know that?

14:55.512 --> 14:57.514
My daughter is in trouble.
We're finished here.

14:57.847 --> 15:00.066
Take your hands off me!
What are you doing?

15:00.266 --> 15:01.851
Take it easy, relax, everyone.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.595
Get your hands off me!

15:03.795 --> 15:05.017
Stop, don't do that.

15:05.217 --> 15:06.239
Calm down. Take it easy.

15:06.439 --> 15:10.694
Ma'am, he just disobeyed a direct
order from a police officer.

15:10.894 --> 15:13.113
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
place him under arrest.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.415
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Come on.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.951
Oh, my God.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.846
What was your name?

15:30.347 --> 15:31.848
Excuse me!

15:55.572 --> 15:58.625
You know Richard Walsh
was killed tonight.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.126
Scott Baylor, too.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.498
Did you know Jack was there
when it happened?

16:05.698 --> 16:07.250
I don't know anything about it.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.838
And you have no idea where he is right now?

16:12.038 --> 16:13.056
No.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.726
- You're making a big mistake, Nina.
- No, you are.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.547
When this lockdown is over, I'm gonna
have a little talk with the Double-I team...

16:20.747 --> 16:24.234
...about some highly irregular banking transactions
which were traced to your account.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.762
Trust me. The trouble Jack's in right now...

16:27.962 --> 16:30.790
...my bank accounts won't even
raise an eyebrow.

16:30.990 --> 16:35.495
He's going down, Nina. That doesn't
mean you have to go down with him.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.334
True love is a beautiful thing, but...

16:43.336 --> 16:45.121
...why go to extremes?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.896
I know about the affair.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.598
See, Jack talks about it all the time.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.400
Sure he does.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.602
How else would I know about it?

17:01.554 --> 17:06.358
It is possible, that Jack's not the
shining knight you think he is.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.397
Want to try again?

17:13.398 --> 17:14.901
Where is Jack now?

17:53.156 --> 17:54.457
This is Mary 1-3-8.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.660
Need a transportation unit
at the Fifth Street bridge.

17:59.662 --> 18:00.664
Ma'am.

18:00.864 --> 18:03.016
Please. Would you listen to me...

18:03.216 --> 18:05.168
Repeat location with full request.

18:05.368 --> 18:09.038
1-Mary-3-8. I need transportation
unit at the Fifth Street bridge

18:09.238 --> 18:11.057
Copy, 1-Mary-3-8.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.660
It's Teri. Leave a message after
the beep and I'll call you back.

18:14.860 --> 18:18.264
Honey, it's me, I'm just checking
up on Kim. I'll call you back soon.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.558
Don't move.

19:58.815 --> 19:59.816
Damn it.

20:08.992 --> 20:13.463
2-Adam-1-4, reporting shots fired at
18166 San Fernando Road.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.164
Request backup.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.052
2-Adam-14, backup's on the way.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.721
18166 San Fernando.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.759
Stop! Police.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.395
- Hold it right there.
- Federal Agent!

20:29.595 --> 20:31.397
Your badge, nice and slow.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.399
Putting my gun down.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.856
"CTU." What the hell is that?

20:40.056 --> 20:41.658
Counter Terrorist Unit.

20:41.858 --> 20:44.327
This guy is not waiting around for me.

20:44.527 --> 20:46.996
You better shoot me or help. Decide now.

20:49.699 --> 20:51.200
All right, I'll help you.

20:51.701 --> 20:52.702
I'm picking up my gun.

20:53.202 --> 20:54.203
Easy.

21:02.879 --> 21:04.797
You be careful with that gun.
I need him alive.

21:14.891 --> 21:16.609
Throw me your flashlight.

21:56.399 --> 21:57.767
Take cover!

22:15.368 --> 22:18.037
2-Adam-1-4, backup's on the way.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.647
2-Adam-1-4, copy.

22:19.847 --> 22:21.257
Turn off your radio.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.260
I wish you hadn't called for backup.

22:24.460 --> 22:25.061
Why?

22:25.261 --> 22:26.913
Because cops have to play by the rules.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.765
I may have to break a few with this guy.

22:28.965 --> 22:30.266
Who is he?

22:38.891 --> 22:42.378
To sum it up, Jack leaves his wife...

22:42.879 --> 22:44.380
...shacks up with you for a while...

22:44.897 --> 22:49.402
...gets bored and then moves back home,
leaving you out in the cold.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.406
My personal life is not your concern.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.408
It is if it affects your work.

22:55.410 --> 22:56.909
It doesn't affect my work.

23:00.913 --> 23:04.917
How long you been with the Agency, Nina?
Six years, seven?

23:05.117 --> 23:06.719
Seven years.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.805
I remember when you first joined.

23:09.005 --> 23:12.008
You were going places. Everybody knew it.

23:14.010 --> 23:15.978
It hasn't quite happened
for you yet, has it?

23:16.979 --> 23:18.380
You ever wonder why?

23:18.580 --> 23:19.982
I've done all right.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.485
But you could have done so much better.

23:22.685 --> 23:24.837
You had a great reputation, once.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.190
You know what your reputation is now?

23:28.691 --> 23:31.611
Jack's flunky. His lap dog.

23:32.612 --> 23:35.615
This is your chance to get
back on track, Nina.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.586
He's a loose cannon. Rules don't
apply to Jack Bauer.

23:40.786 --> 23:45.291
He does what he wants, when he wants and
he doesn't care whose life it affects.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.344
He shot me with a tranq gun here
in the office, for God's sakes.

23:48.845 --> 23:50.713
That's because you withheld
crucial information.

23:50.913 --> 23:52.065
I was following orders.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.851
Maybe he's following orders.
Orders you don't know about.

23:55.051 --> 23:58.071
He violated lockdown and
left you holding the bag.

23:58.271 --> 24:02.275
If he cared about you, he wouldn't
have put you in that position.

24:02.475 --> 24:03.359
Let me ask you...

24:03.559 --> 24:05.645
...would you have done that to him?

24:07.647 --> 24:11.200
The fact is, I'm just asking you to
do your job and tell me where he is.

24:13.569 --> 24:15.071
I don't know.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.068
Get out!

25:21.604 --> 25:23.806
Maybe she's dead after all.

25:24.006 --> 25:25.691
We have to be sure.

25:32.982 --> 25:34.817
Let's just put her in the van.

25:35.017 --> 25:35.618
No.

25:48.831 --> 25:50.024
Dan.

25:50.224 --> 25:51.417
Shut up!

26:07.733 --> 26:09.185
Move it.

27:05.474 --> 27:06.359
Yeah?

27:06.809 --> 27:08.694
Mason's going to want to talk to you.

27:08.894 --> 27:10.079
What you want me to say?

27:10.279 --> 27:13.949
Jack's made it clear that the three
of us work in confidence.

27:14.950 --> 27:16.952
But doesn't Mason supersede Jack?

27:17.152 --> 27:18.204
No.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.906
What we're doing came from Walsh.

27:22.825 --> 27:25.661
George will say anything
to get you to talk.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.663
Do not be intimidated by him.

27:29.632 --> 27:30.633
Okay.

28:05.501 --> 28:06.502
Cross me.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.512
The other building.

28:49.712 --> 28:51.530
This place is like a maze.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.549
All right, I've got a name.

28:54.049 --> 28:56.552
George Ferragamo. Know him?

28:56.752 --> 28:58.554
Yeah. I know the name.

29:02.057 --> 29:05.561
You find anything else, leave a
message on the 802 number only.

29:05.761 --> 29:07.563
Okay, you got it.

29:07.763 --> 29:09.565
Thanks, Carl.

29:37.092 --> 29:39.094
You've been spending an awful lot of time...

29:39.294 --> 29:41.297
...behind closed doors, making phone calls.

29:41.797 --> 29:43.232
Have I?

29:43.432 --> 29:45.384
What's going on, David?

29:51.473 --> 29:54.944
The phone call, earlier tonight,
from Maureen Kingsley...

29:58.447 --> 30:00.449
She's digging up old history.

30:01.450 --> 30:02.952
Bad history.

30:05.454 --> 30:07.239
Just tell me.

30:16.415 --> 30:19.635
She claims that Keith murdered
the boy who raped Nicole.

30:19.835 --> 30:21.053
What?

30:22.638 --> 30:26.442
First, Lyle Gibson was no boy, he was 19.

30:26.642 --> 30:30.930
Second, he killed himself.
The coroner's report proved it.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.932
Maureen has new evidence.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.266
What evidence?

30:35.734 --> 30:37.236
I put Carl on it.

30:38.737 --> 30:43.209
He came up with a name... George Ferragamo.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.528
That's the therapist Keith
went to, what about him?

30:47.529 --> 30:48.330
He claims that...

30:48.664 --> 30:52.034
He's not claiming that Keith
confessed in therapy?

30:52.234 --> 30:54.387
- Apparently.
- Well, then he's lying.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.922
You've got to get our lawyers
on this right away.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.425
Yeah, I know and I will.

31:01.377 --> 31:03.879
- But you know...
- What is it, David?

31:06.715 --> 31:08.017
I just don't understand it.

31:08.217 --> 31:11.578
Maureen's always been very responsible.

31:11.778 --> 31:15.140
One of the few real professionals left.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.192
I'd call this unprofessional.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.280
David...

31:23.616 --> 31:27.536
...you can't seriously think that
our son might be a killer?

31:31.040 --> 31:32.541
No. Of course not.

31:39.915 --> 31:42.584
- Look, I apologized.
- You don't get it, do you?

31:43.085 --> 31:44.520
You've committed a serious crime.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.058
Officer, please. Clearly,
he's upset. We both are.

31:49.258 --> 31:51.727
If you could just give us
a break? Please?

31:54.263 --> 31:56.398
1-Mary-38.

31:56.598 --> 31:57.900
1-Mary-3-8, go.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.985
1-Mary-38, an emergency call...

32:00.185 --> 32:03.989
...was placed at that location,
approximately 30 minutes ago.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.524
Copy. Thanks.

32:09.695 --> 32:12.581
That still doesn't justify you
disobeying a police officer.

32:13.916 --> 32:14.783
Idiot.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.019
Here's the backup. Ground units
are on their way.

32:34.219 --> 32:36.021
I need him now to claim jurisdiction.

32:36.305 --> 32:37.523
Where do you want me?

32:37.723 --> 32:41.443
Keep him pinned down at the exit. I'll
try to go around the other side.

32:41.643 --> 32:43.529
- Don't hit him.
- I won't.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.732
Don't hit me, either.

33:12.674 --> 33:15.511
This is the police.
Drop your weapon.

33:30.325 --> 33:32.327
I told you to stay put.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.686
Over here.

33:57.886 --> 33:59.438
You want me, come and get me.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.890
Don't do it! He'll kill both of us!

34:05.844 --> 34:06.845
Don't do it!

34:11.033 --> 34:11.833
Come out!

34:12.034 --> 34:13.953
- Drop the gun!
- Don't!

34:14.152 --> 34:17.906
Step out where I can see you,
and throw down the gun!

34:18.106 --> 34:19.592
- Don't do it.
- Drop it!

34:19.792 --> 34:22.244
I'm gonna drop the gun but you gotta relax!

34:22.444 --> 34:24.187
Don't do it. He'll kill us both.

34:24.387 --> 34:26.130
Shut up! Put down the gun! Drop it!

34:27.049 --> 34:28.350
Speak English, asshole.

34:28.550 --> 34:31.553
The gun is going down.
I'm putting down the gun.

34:31.753 --> 34:33.054
The gun's going down.

34:41.013 --> 34:43.232
Good work, throw me your cuffs.

34:44.733 --> 34:46.150
Oh, my God.

34:53.992 --> 34:56.695
I think it might be
up here, swing to the right.

34:59.414 --> 35:00.582
Yeah, maybe.

35:03.168 --> 35:07.789
There is someone up ahead, maybe they saw
something. Roll down your window.

35:10.092 --> 35:13.879
Excuse me, could you tell me
what happened here, please.

35:14.079 --> 35:15.681
It might involve our children.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.683
You shouldn't let your children
come down here.

35:17.883 --> 35:21.386
Yeah, I know that, but could you just
please tell me what happened?

35:21.586 --> 35:23.522
Girl was hit by a car.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.642
Ma'am, do you know where they took her?

35:28.143 --> 35:29.645
St. Mark's is closest.

35:31.647 --> 35:33.699
Was she alive?

35:33.899 --> 35:35.200
She didn't look good.

35:35.701 --> 35:36.702
Go.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.802
Hey, it's Gaines.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.417
Where's the other one?

36:25.617 --> 36:29.955
She was a problem, so we killed her.

36:30.155 --> 36:30.806
The body?

36:31.006 --> 36:32.007
No one'll find it.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.211
- She been any trouble?
- Not at all.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.025
You're with me now.

36:51.526 --> 36:54.112
Be good, you'll be back at
the mall in a day or two.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.232
Be bad, and you won't. Clear?

37:00.285 --> 37:01.286
Good.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.628
Agent Farrell, come with me, please.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.272
Jamey.

37:20.472 --> 37:23.725
I've already told these men
I don't know anything.

37:23.925 --> 37:26.228
Trying to protect Jack and Nina?

37:26.428 --> 37:27.763
Don't be naive.

37:28.764 --> 37:29.765
Sit.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.622
Let me tell you how the game is played.

37:36.822 --> 37:41.410
First thing they do is to tell you that
you're the only one they can trust.

37:41.910 --> 37:46.415
That's flattering and it makes you
trust them in return. Right?

37:46.615 --> 37:49.418
Then they get you to do something
you shouldn't.

37:49.618 --> 37:52.421
Say you don't know where
Jack went, for example.

37:55.424 --> 37:59.177
Then the next thing you know, Jack's gone...

37:59.678 --> 38:04.182
...Nina's stonewalling, and you're
in the hot seat. Sound familiar?

38:07.469 --> 38:10.972
You're being used. I've seen
it a million times.

38:11.172 --> 38:13.975
If you help me out, I'll help you out.

38:14.976 --> 38:15.977
If you hold out...

38:26.071 --> 38:27.372
Mason.

38:28.373 --> 38:30.208
Really? Good.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.461
I'm on my way.

38:32.961 --> 38:36.465
It seems our boy has surfaced. His name
popped up on a police frequency.

38:36.965 --> 38:37.966
Not that I'm surprised.

38:38.166 --> 38:39.501
Is he in trouble?

38:44.973 --> 38:47.934
Off the record, just out of curiosity...

38:48.134 --> 38:51.096
...what's so special about Jack Bauer?

38:54.733 --> 38:58.236
All right, we found Bauer. We're
pulling out. Lockdown's over.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.406
I hope you give some thought
to what we talked about.

39:06.128 --> 39:07.779
Call it in as a DOA.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.210
Pedestrian hit by vehicle.

39:23.712 --> 39:26.298
Everything checked out, here you go.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.367
What was her name?

39:29.567 --> 39:31.136
Jessie Hampton.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.607
You know anything about this guy?

39:36.108 --> 39:38.010
No. But I got to take him for questioning.

39:38.210 --> 39:39.912
Maybe you didn't notice,
but he killed a cop.

39:40.112 --> 39:42.697
Of course I did, but there's
something else at stake here.

39:42.897 --> 39:45.150
Not to me. Not to these guys.

39:49.037 --> 39:50.906
All right.

39:51.289 --> 39:53.825
Can I at least have a few minutes with him?

39:56.211 --> 39:57.212
Guys.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.831
Thank you.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.334
Get up.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.340
If you tell me who you are,
I might be able to help you.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.475
Don't let them take me.
If they do, I'm dead.

40:10.675 --> 40:11.522
They seem in control.

40:11.722 --> 40:14.146
I'm not worried about them.

40:15.430 --> 40:16.732
Who are you worried about?

40:16.932 --> 40:18.116
First you spring me, then I talk.

40:18.316 --> 40:21.820
- That's not gonna happen.
- That's too bad...

40:22.020 --> 40:23.322
...Bauer.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.024
Bauer? How do you know my name?

40:26.224 --> 40:27.459
Time's up.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.945
I know more than that.

40:30.278 --> 40:33.198
If you ever want to see your daughter again,
get me out of this.

40:33.398 --> 40:35.200
What do you know about my daughter?

40:37.169 --> 40:41.173
I'm fine.
