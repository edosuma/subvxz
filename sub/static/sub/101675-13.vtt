Previously onYoung Sheldon...

00:03.481 --> 00:04.743
What are you doing here?

00:04.787 --> 00:05.831
Apparently,
the head of the college

00:05.875 --> 00:07.050
wants to talk to us.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.834
I'll just get
right to the point.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.445
I would like you and your son

00:10.488 --> 00:13.491
to meet with a very important
benefactor of the college.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.145
Why us?Sheldon is

00:15.189 --> 00:18.322
an impressive addition
to the physics program,

00:18.366 --> 00:21.543
and-and we like our donors
to feel really good

00:21.586 --> 00:23.066
about where their money's going.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.459
No, thank you.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.895
Can I speak to you alone?

00:25.938 --> 00:27.114
Will you give us a minute?

00:27.157 --> 00:28.985
Very well.
But if you're looking to see

00:29.029 --> 00:30.465
if my father will be
a potential donor,

00:30.508 --> 00:32.510
you are barking
up the wrong tree.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.213
ADULT SHELDON:
People often ask
why I was so resistant

00:39.256 --> 00:41.258
to getting a driver's license.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.260
My spotty history
with motor vehicles

00:43.304 --> 00:45.480
was certainly a factor.

00:45.523 --> 00:46.481
Please slow down.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.091
I'm going eight
miles an hour.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.745
A cow just passed us.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.921
SHELDON:
You're gonna hit it!

00:51.964 --> 00:53.009
Make it stop!

00:53.053 --> 00:54.184
It's just a car wash.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.839
Do something!It's just a car wash.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.014
We're gonna die!

00:58.058 --> 00:59.494
Just a car wash.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.669
Why did I agree to this?

01:00.712 --> 01:03.063
I don't care for this at all.

You sure

01:38.185 --> 01:39.490
we shouldn't call
an ambulance?

01:39.534 --> 01:41.057
I'm fine. Sheldon?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.058
I feel fine.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.103
What happened?

01:43.146 --> 01:45.192
Oh, a cat ran in front of me.

01:45.235 --> 01:46.541
You couldn't stop?

01:46.584 --> 01:49.500
I tried,
but the brake just gave out.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.633
Well, thank goodness
it wasn't worse.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.504
I should have aimed for the cat.

01:53.548 --> 01:55.724
Looks like your car's gonna be
out of commission for a while.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.466
If you need a ride, the church
offers a shuttle service.

01:58.509 --> 02:01.338
I'm not getting
on that geezer bus.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.167
It's just for people
who can't get around.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.560
That's 'cause they're
so shriveled up,

02:05.603 --> 02:07.997
they can't even see
over the steering wheel.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.303
That's not nice.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.566
I've driven that van--
it is grim.

02:11.609 --> 02:14.569
If Meemaw doesn't have a car,
who's gonna drive me to college?

02:14.612 --> 02:17.615
I guess if we leave early,
I could take you before work.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.140
Hey, when you take the shuttle,
bring hard candy.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.967
They gobble it up.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.187
MISSY:
I can't believe

02:24.231 --> 02:26.146
you and Meemaw
almost died tonight.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.799
I wouldn't say
we almost died.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.584
Well, that's what I'm saying
at school tomorrow.

02:29.627 --> 02:32.239
Why?It's called good storytelling.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.154
But it's lying.They don't know that.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.459
You weren't even
in the car.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.592
Doesn't matter.
Shay McElheney's dad

02:37.635 --> 02:41.117
had a kidney stone-- she
got out of homework for a week.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.075
I can't believe you'd use
my traumatic experience

02:43.119 --> 02:44.468
to manipulate people.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.166
Really? I can.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.559
Hey, did the engine catch fire?

02:48.603 --> 02:49.865
No!

02:49.908 --> 02:51.432
You're in shock.
You don't know what happened.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.825
I might be a little late
picking you up tonight,

02:53.869 --> 02:55.218
so you can wait in the library.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.959
All right.I didn't have time

02:57.002 --> 02:58.656

What's going on?

03:06.882 --> 03:09.014
I can't do it.What's wrong?

03:09.058 --> 03:10.364
What if there's another crash?

03:10.407 --> 03:13.193
Baby, that's
not gonna happen again.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.455
You don't know that.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.718
Sheldon,
if you don't get in right now,

03:16.761 --> 03:18.198
you're going to miss school.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.025
[sighs]:
True.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.246
I know you don't
believe in it,

03:23.290 --> 03:25.640
but I'm gonna say an extra
special prayer right now

03:25.683 --> 03:26.858
to keep us safe.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.033
Lord,

03:28.077 --> 03:29.383
please look after me and Sheldon

03:35.432 --> 03:37.739
I'll get back to you.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.958
You see Sheldon?That way.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.308
What's going on?

03:41.351 --> 03:43.875
He's having some sort
of panic attack.

03:43.919 --> 03:47.052
[chuckles]:
Oh, man. My story
just keeps getting better.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.974
Baby, you can't go
the rest of your life

03:56.018 --> 03:57.628
never getting in a car again.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.979
Before cars were invented,
people did it all the time.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.025

04:03.068 --> 04:05.419
Well, I'm not gonna force you.

I can't get him in the car.

04:19.955 --> 04:20.956
So what now?

04:20.999 --> 04:22.566
So he's not going to school.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.655
You know, on The A-Team,
Mr. T is afraid to fly,

04:24.699 --> 04:27.136
and they give him special milk
to put him to sleep.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.703
Ooh.No!

04:28.746 --> 04:29.747
Aw.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.707
I don't care what your guy says.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.578
Have him check it again.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.625
Sorry, I'm cranky.

04:37.668 --> 04:41.237
No problem. I like when you yell
at people who aren't me.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.458
Stupid mechanic said
the brakes are just fine.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.808
Well, you probably stepped
on the wrong pedal.

04:46.851 --> 04:47.939
I didn't.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.114
I'm just saying, it happens

04:49.158 --> 04:50.377
with people our age, you know.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.161
I've been driving my whole life.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.206
I know which pedal is which.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.947
Now you're yelling at me.Sorry.

04:55.991 --> 05:00.256
What do you think about letting
me borrow your truck today?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.258
I don't know.
Why not?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.868
'Cause I like my truck.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.087
Not funny.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.568
It is. You're just cranky.

05:07.611 --> 05:08.960
Fine.

05:09.004 --> 05:12.834
Maybe I'll just ride my bicycle
to the salon.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.879
You ride a bike?

05:14.923 --> 05:17.404
Is that amusing to you?

05:17.447 --> 05:19.710
An old lady riding a bike?

Oh, no.

05:32.810 --> 05:36.248
No. But now I got no car
for a while.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.512
You could ride your bike.

05:38.555 --> 05:41.384
An old lady on a bike?
That's not cool.

05:41.428 --> 05:44.344
Really? Then I won't ask
how I look on one.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.867
You look great.

05:45.910 --> 05:46.955
I know.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.349
I just wanted
to hear you say it.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.654
[chuckles]

05:50.698 --> 05:52.656
So, there's no one
who can lend you a car?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.179
There is the church shuttle,

05:54.223 --> 05:58.096
but that just feels like
it's the end of the line.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.837
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

05:59.881 --> 06:04.015
There's all sorts of
depressing steps before the end.

Is everything all right?Yes,

06:40.617 --> 06:42.140
but in the interest
of self-preservation,

06:42.184 --> 06:45.056
I've decided to avoid traveling
in motor vehicles.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.450
I'm sure there's a story
behind that.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.452
There is.I don't want to hear it.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.715
So, how shall we handle
today's class?

06:51.759 --> 06:53.935
Well, I'm sure you can get notes
from another student.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.067
Or you could give the lecture
to me right now.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.721
That's preposterous.

06:57.765 --> 07:00.550
Why? We could be creating
a new model of education

07:00.594 --> 07:02.987
where students
could learn remotely.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.815
It could be the wave
of the future.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.426

it's your responsibility

to bring the class to you.

for "geezer bus,"

07:38.806 --> 07:40.590

07:40.634 --> 07:42.070
Oh, that's hilarious.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.507
Maybe it's under "O"
for "old fogies."

about the physics class
I'm missing.

And how come you're not here?

had to get towed away.

Oh, you poor thing.

What can I do to help?

to page 78 in the textbook,

08:30.945 --> 08:32.512
I'll begin today's lecture.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.905
[gasps] We should come up
with some kind of video system

08:34.949 --> 08:36.994

when I raise my hand.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.518
Why don't you just tell me?

08:38.561 --> 08:40.432
Let's try it. Hand-raise.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.130
Yes, Sheldon.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.045
That worked great.

08:45.829 --> 08:48.528
Hey, Connie.
Waiting for the mail?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.181
Yeah. You know me.Yeah.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.400
Oh.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.228
Something
from Publishers Clearing House.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.577
Maybe you won.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.536
Yeah, wouldn't that
be something?
Yeah.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.841
You know,
people think

08:57.885 --> 08:59.582
Publishers Clearing House
is Ed McMahon,

08:59.626 --> 09:01.279
but that's actually
a different company.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.716
Is that so?Yeah.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.152
Publishers Clearing House
is the Prize Patrol

09:04.195 --> 09:05.588
with the giant check.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.155
Ed McMahon...

09:07.198 --> 09:09.853
Well, it sure is nice talking
to you, Edwin. Bye.

09:09.897 --> 09:10.724
Oh.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.552
The church van.
My grandma

09:12.595 --> 09:14.249
rides that sometimes.Edwin.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.598
Hmm?Beat it.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.208
All right. Yep.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.123
One can choose
the extended-zone scheme,

09:19.167 --> 09:20.864
the reduced-zone scheme
or the...

09:20.908 --> 09:22.562
Hand-raise.Yes?

09:22.605 --> 09:24.128
I set you up on speakerphone,

09:24.172 --> 09:26.435
so now it's really like
I'm learning in the future.

09:26.478 --> 09:27.436
May I continue?

09:27.479 --> 09:29.046
Ahead warp factor five.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.962
That's from Star Trek,
which is also in the future.

09:33.442 --> 09:34.965
Connie Tucker?Yeah.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.488
Give me one second.
I'll help you in.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.753
No, no, I don't need your help.
I can get it myself.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.452
She opened that
door by herself.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.323
Looks like we got
a feisty one.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.238
Don't test me.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.501
Oh, yeah, she's feisty.

09:49.545 --> 09:50.590
What?

09:50.633 --> 09:51.852
BOTH:
She's feisty!

09:53.767 --> 09:55.420
What?

10:05.256 --> 10:06.736
Vern.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.520
Connie.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.435
Where you headed, Connie?

10:10.479 --> 10:11.741
Stop flirting with her.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.222
I'm not flirting with her.
I was being cordial.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.963
Mm-hmm. I'm Hortense,

10:16.006 --> 10:19.488
his wife, which, clearly,
he seems to have forgotten.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.446
Judas Priest, give it a rest.

10:21.490 --> 10:22.447
That's Doris.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.449
Hello, Doris.
What?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.495
Turn on your hearing aid.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.367
It's nice to meet y'all.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.283
And to answer your question,
I'm headed to the salon.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.242
Oh, fancy.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.636
We're headed to the pharmacy.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.813
Seven pills a day.

10:39.856 --> 10:43.686
You take nine--
clearly one ain't working.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.688
Okay, I'm on. What'd I miss?

10:45.732 --> 10:48.169
She's headed to the salon!

10:48.212 --> 10:50.345
Ooh, fancy.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.046
[sighs]

10:56.090 --> 10:58.353
[phone ringing]

11:01.965 --> 11:03.358
Cooper residence.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.926
Sheldon,
President Hagemeyer again.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.190
Just calling to make sure it all
worked out with Dr. Linkletter.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.626
Yes, everything went quite well.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.715
Although he was a tad irritable.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.326
Maybe because I ripped him
a new one.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.502
A new what?Not important.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.679
Uh, whatever you need
for classes,

11:19.722 --> 11:21.158
you just say the word.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.160
I suppose it could be helpful
if I could dial

11:23.204 --> 11:25.206
into the university's server
while still

11:25.249 --> 11:26.642
on the phone with my professors.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.339
Like a second phone line?

11:28.383 --> 11:29.776
We can take care of that.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.168
Well, as my meemaw would say,

11:31.212 --> 11:33.518
"Aren't you
just a spoonful of sugar?"

11:33.562 --> 11:35.390
[busy tone droning]

11:35.433 --> 11:37.958
Who is he talking to
all this time?

11:38.001 --> 11:40.917
And if there's anything else
you need, you just let me know.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.832
I can't think of anything
except that I wanted

11:42.876 --> 11:44.660
Strawberry Quik
and my brother put the empty

11:44.704 --> 11:46.662
milk carton back in the fridge.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.490
Ah, brothers, they're the worst.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.753
Mine's an environmental
activist.

11:50.797 --> 11:51.885
[groans]

11:52.973 --> 11:54.539
And then they crashed
into a tree.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.716
Oh, no!The engine caught fire.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.456
My goodness, is everyone okay?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.719
Thankfully, yes.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.112
But I was pretty shook up.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.375
Well, don't worry
about that test today.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.334
Thank you for understanding.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.205
Mm-hmm.

12:08.249 --> 12:11.295
Oh, and where are we
on homework tonight?

12:11.339 --> 12:13.123
Don't push it.
Right.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.256
Hey, I'm just gonna run Doris
into the bank.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.736
we'll be back in a minute.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.390
Doris. Whoa.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.784
You seem like
you can get around,

12:21.828 --> 12:24.744
so why are you
in this geezer-buggy?

12:24.787 --> 12:26.789
I had a little car accident.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.922
Oh, no.Ooh. Anybody get hurt?

12:28.965 --> 12:30.488
Only the tree.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.055
Step on the wrong pedal?

12:32.099 --> 12:33.796
No.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.276
Maybe.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.147
Maybe, my ass.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.453
Hey, that sort of thing happens.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.846
HORTENSE:
Oh.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.239
He drove
into all kinds of stuff

12:42.283 --> 12:43.763
before they took his keys away.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.155
[chuckling]:
Remember the goose?

12:45.199 --> 12:47.157
Ooh.Feathers everywhere.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.072
HORTENSE:
Huh.I just think it'd kill me

12:49.116 --> 12:51.074
to lose my independence
like that.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.249
Oh, it's not so bad.

12:52.293 --> 12:55.035
Sometimes Clayton takes us
to the park.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.340
Like dogs.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.951
I got places to go--

12:57.994 --> 12:59.735
bowling league,
water aerobics,

12:59.779 --> 13:01.476
I drive my grandson to college.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.086
Why can't he drive himself?

13:03.130 --> 13:04.435
Well, he's 11.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.090
Wha...?11 and in college?

13:07.134 --> 13:08.222
He's special.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.051
Our grandson is 27.

13:11.094 --> 13:14.228
Mm, he may be
the other kind of special.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.759
Sheldon?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.979
SHELDON:
In my room.

13:27.676 --> 13:28.851
I saw a truck outside.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.331
what's wrong
with the phone?

13:30.374 --> 13:32.072
Nothing.[whirring]
Oh.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.638
Adding a second line.

13:33.682 --> 13:34.857
I'm almost done here.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.293
Just got to hop up on the roof.

13:36.337 --> 13:40.080
Hold on. You can't just
add another phone line

13:40.123 --> 13:41.342
without asking.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.822
I didn't do it.
The university did.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.085
Why would they do that?I asked them to.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.956
Are you some sort
of special kid?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.653
You have no idea.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.742
Shouldn't you be up on the roof?

13:51.961 --> 13:55.225
You can't just ask
the university for things.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.358
President Hagemeyer seemed
so happy to help.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.794
Why rob her of that?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.970
Sheldon, you are going to have

14:01.014 --> 14:02.842
to get in a car again
eventually.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.365
It's not looking like it.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.975
[doorbell rings]

14:06.019 --> 14:08.021
This isn't over.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.154
Can I help you?

14:11.198 --> 14:13.591
Grocery delivery
for Sheldon Cooper?What is it?

14:13.635 --> 14:17.508
Looks like milk, straws and
three cans of Strawberry Quik.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.119
Oh, boy.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.163
Thank you.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.512
Would you tip him?

14:21.556 --> 14:23.253
I'm a little light.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.864
So, I was singing

14:24.907 --> 14:26.648
karaoke with
my girlfriend

14:26.691 --> 14:29.869
who used to be married to
the guy I'm currently dating.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.088
What the heck is a karaoke?

14:32.132 --> 14:33.437
It's when you stand up and sing

14:33.481 --> 14:35.352
in front of everybody
at the bar.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.137
You're like
a Las Vegas showgirl.[Hortense laughs]

14:37.180 --> 14:39.443
Oh, no, no, anybody can do it.

14:39.487 --> 14:42.011
I'll take you sometime.Oh, please. Can we?

14:42.055 --> 14:44.666
Well, could I sing
"Blue Suede Shoes"?

14:44.709 --> 14:47.974
You bet.You better turn your hearing aid
down for that one.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.105
You got that right.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.890
Tell me,
when was the last time

14:50.933 --> 14:53.893
you went and got all
dolled up at a salon?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.198
I don't even remember.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.591
It's been years.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.549
Does it look like
I go to a salon?

14:58.593 --> 15:00.290
We're going now.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.727
I'm gonna take you,
and it's on me.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.294
This is exciting.[laughter]

15:04.338 --> 15:06.383
It's a good thing
I got my heart pills.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.560
[phone ringing]

15:09.604 --> 15:10.953
Hello.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.868
Hi. This is Linda Hagemeyer
from the university.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.609
Is this Mrs. Cooper?

15:14.652 --> 15:16.089
Yes, it is.Excellent.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.265
Did the Strawberry Quik arrive?

15:18.308 --> 15:19.962
As a matter of fact, it did.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.312
Sounds like nasty stuff,
but, hey,

15:22.356 --> 15:24.662
whatever floats
the little guy's boat, right?

15:24.706 --> 15:28.536
Listen, I appreciate that you
value Sheldon at your school.

15:28.579 --> 15:31.626
Love him.But I am trying to raise him

15:31.669 --> 15:35.935
to be a well-rounded individual
who will get in a car.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.415
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.287
Academia draws all kinds
of eccentrics.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.115
Yeah, we've got
a biology professor

15:42.158 --> 15:44.204
who hasn't cut his nails
in years.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.510
Ugh. Looks like
Edward Scissorhands.

15:46.554 --> 15:49.296
That is not what I want
for my son.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.993
[sighs]

15:51.037 --> 15:53.126
Do you have children?

15:53.169 --> 15:54.866
No, but thanks
for bringing it up.

15:54.910 --> 15:58.696
Anyway, I would like Sheldon
to function in society,

15:58.740 --> 16:02.874
and it does not help if you give
him everything that he asks for.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.138
I'm just doing my job.

16:05.921 --> 16:09.011
And I am just doing mine.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.057
Understood.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.145
Thank you.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.669
Oh, and, um, in a few minutes,

16:14.712 --> 16:17.150
my assistant is gonna be
dropping off a big old basket

16:17.193 --> 16:19.021
of Star Trektapes. [chuckles]

16:19.065 --> 16:22.764
I'm afraid it's too late for me
to pump the brakes on that one.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.766
♪ Whoa!

16:24.809 --> 16:27.116
♪

16:32.774 --> 16:36.038
Sarah did a real nice
job on my cuticles.Yeah.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.909
So where we headed next?
And don't say dinner.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.607
Oh, but it's almost 4:00.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.436
What?![loudly]:
It's almost 4:00.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.785
Ooh, dinnertime.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.917
Just get in.

16:45.961 --> 16:49.312
Ooh. She's like
a muscle man.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.012
Move on over, Doris.What?

16:59.409 --> 17:01.150
ADULT SHELDON:
My mother eventually coaxed me

17:01.194 --> 17:03.283
back into a car
with a trip to RadioShack.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.415
She knew I was nervous

17:05.459 --> 17:07.983
so she came up with an interesting distraction.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.246
Baby, how about
we play a car game?

17:10.290 --> 17:13.641
I suppose.
Can I make it science-based?

17:13.684 --> 17:16.426
Sure.I'll say an element
starting with "A,"

17:16.470 --> 17:19.038
then you repeat that
and add one starting with "B."

17:19.081 --> 17:21.170
I don't think I'll get very far.Great.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.650
Then I'll win. Aluminum.

17:22.693 --> 17:27.307
Okay, uh, you said
"A" for aluminum.

17:27.350 --> 17:31.572
"B." Is boron an element?Yes.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.748
ADULT SHELDON:
It was the beginning
of a new tradition.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.751
One that would eventually
bring countless hours of joy

17:36.794 --> 17:38.709
to Leonard
on our drives to work.

17:38.753 --> 17:42.626
Much like my mother,
he never beat me.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.802
I don't know an element
that starts with "D."

17:44.846 --> 17:46.543
I win. That was fun.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.502
Round two. Argon.
