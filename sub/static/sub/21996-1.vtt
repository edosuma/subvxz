00:01.769 --> 00:04.036
You know, the Civil War was
so many years ago,

00:04.138 --> 00:07.639
but when I'm here,
it feels like it's now.

00:07.742 --> 00:11.143
Something happens every
single day that I'm here.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.181
We are at the McRaven Mansion.

00:16.283 --> 00:19.084
[ Gasps ] I just heard somebody
whispering in my ear.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.953
Somebody was whispering
in my left ear.

00:22.857 --> 00:26.892
During the war, this place
was used as a field hospital.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.727
-This won't work.
-Listen.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.296
No.<i> You</i> listen!
<i>You listen!</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:33.999
The Civil War
ain't over in Vicksburg.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.939
¶¶

00:41.041 --> 00:42.541
ZAK: There are things
in this world

00:42.643 --> 00:44.643
that we will never
fully understand.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.578
<i>Understand.</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:49.381
We want answers.
<i>Answers.</i>

00:49.483 --> 00:53.452
We have worked years
to build our credibility,

00:53.554 --> 00:56.889
our reputation,

00:56.991 --> 00:58.257
working alongside

00:58.359 --> 01:01.593
the most renowned professionals
in the field,

01:01.695 --> 01:04.430
capturing groundbreaking proof
of the paranormal.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.064
-It's working!
-Whoa! What was that?

01:06.167 --> 01:09.067
I can't give you
an explanation.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.437
ZAK: This is our evidence,

01:11.539 --> 01:13.572

01:18.145 --> 01:21.013
ZAK: "See what a lot of land
these fellows hold,

01:21.115 --> 01:23.348
"of which Vicksburg is the key!

01:23.451 --> 01:25.818
"The war can never be
brought to a close

01:25.920 --> 01:28.787
until that key
is in our pocket."

01:28.889 --> 01:32.925
For the next several weeks,
we will be living

01:33.027 --> 01:36.428
in the town
of Vicksburg, Mississippi,

01:36.530 --> 01:40.966
said to be one of the most
haunted towns in America.

01:41.068 --> 01:45.771
We were invited by the mayor
to come here

01:45.873 --> 01:48.307
to help the citizens
find answers

01:48.409 --> 01:51.176
for the enormous amount
of hauntings.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.678
During the Civil War,

01:52.780 --> 01:55.747
Vicksburg was
the last Southern stronghold

01:55.850 --> 01:58.050
along the vital
Mississippi River,

01:58.152 --> 02:00.319
which delivered crucial supplies

02:00.421 --> 02:03.155
to weary Confederate soldiers.

02:03.257 --> 02:06.458
For 47 days,
this town witnessed

02:06.560 --> 02:09.528
unimaginable death
and destruction.

02:09.630 --> 02:14.233
In 1863 was
the siege of Vicksburg.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.102
Right here in this house
was the headquarters

02:17.204 --> 02:19.304
of John C. Pemberton

02:19.406 --> 02:21.740
for the Confederate army.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.243
In July of 1863,

02:24.345 --> 02:28.247
he surrendered
to the Union forces.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.950
Thousands and thousands
of casualties.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.087
¶¶

02:38.526 --> 02:41.693
We first meet with
the mayor of Vicksburg,

02:41.795 --> 02:45.197
who wants to brief us on
the mission he has set for us.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.867
Well, first let me welcome you
to the city of Vicksburg,

02:48.969 --> 02:50.969
a very historical city.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.405
And I'm honored to be sitting
here, talking to you and...

02:53.507 --> 02:55.541
Thank you.
...as I understand it,

02:55.643 --> 02:58.744
you are the best
in the business.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.814
There've been some stories
around here and some spirits.

03:02.917 --> 03:06.418
And you're on your own.
I want you to know that.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.654
-Okay.
-You gonna have to sign a waiver

03:08.756 --> 03:11.056
because if this ghost
gets you...
ZAK: Mm-hmm.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.257
...you're on your own.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.760
But I would hope
that your coming here

03:14.862 --> 03:17.629
would bring some closure
to all the stories

03:17.731 --> 03:20.966
that have been told about how
haunted it is in these areas.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.768
So welcome to Vicksburg.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.070
-Thank you.
-We appreciate that.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.773
And on behalf of us,
we just want to leave here

03:27.875 --> 03:29.541
saying that we made
the city proud.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.876
We made you proud.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.512
And we came here with respect
and, more importantly,

03:33.614 --> 03:35.714
just helped your citizens
find answers.

03:35.816 --> 03:36.949
And we thank you.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.817
We just want y'all to be able
to leave alive.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.753
<i>Leave alive. Leave alive.</i>

03:41.855 --> 03:45.157
ZAK: With those chilling
last words by the mayor,

03:45.259 --> 03:49.995
we start our very dangerous
town-wide investigation

03:50.097 --> 03:51.496
at a place where

03:51.599 --> 03:53.832
a historic mansion's
new current owner

03:53.934 --> 03:57.603
needs our help
after the previous owner fled

03:57.705 --> 04:01.673
from being violently attacked
multiple times.

04:01.775 --> 04:05.677
Dr. Reed is extremely concerned
that his tour guides

04:05.779 --> 04:08.880
have attachments
and are being strongly affected.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.516
He needs answers.

04:11.619 --> 04:15.120
¶¶

04:15.222 --> 04:17.756
So this is the oldest-standing
structure in Vicksburg.

04:17.858 --> 04:21.360
ZAK: Really?
I mean, this house was old
when the Civil War started.

04:21.462 --> 04:25.497
There are three sections.
1849 is this portion.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.400
The middle section is 1836.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.103
And the original portion
of the house is 1797.
Whew.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.171
I mean, you gotta keep in mind
that when this house was built,

04:33.273 --> 04:34.773
George Washington
was president.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.908
Right. That's incredible.
You know, so lots
and lots of history

04:37.011 --> 04:38.210
over the 200 --
you know, 220 years.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.145
Yeah. The McRaven Mansion
is a true time capsule.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.880
It is. It's the time capsule
of the South.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.017
¶¶

04:49.089 --> 04:51.356
-Do you live here?
-No.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.058
-It's haunted.
-Hmm?

04:53.160 --> 04:55.093
It's haunted is the reason
we don't live here.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.628
[ Laughs ]

04:56.730 --> 04:59.164
That's the best answer ever.

04:59.266 --> 05:04.670
We're here because we want to
try to help whatever situation

05:04.772 --> 05:06.605
you have with the hauntings.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.174
Is there anything
that we should know about?

05:09.276 --> 05:12.577
Of course, my concern would be
for my staff, my tour guides.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.180
We have quite a few people
here every day.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.816
And I want to make sure
the house is safe...

05:17.918 --> 05:19.251
Uh-huh.
...is safe for them.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.454
ZAK: The reason
Dr. Reed refuses to live here

05:22.556 --> 05:26.458
and wants to make sure
the tour guides are safe

05:26.560 --> 05:28.160
is because of what occurred

05:28.262 --> 05:32.264
with the home's previous owner,
Leyland French.

05:32.366 --> 05:36.501
Brian Riley worked for Leyland
back in 2002.

05:36.603 --> 05:40.872
He tells us that Leyland would
conduct rituals in the home

05:40.974 --> 05:43.775
and open doorways
he couldn't close,

05:43.877 --> 05:45.844
resulting in violent attacks,

05:45.946 --> 05:49.247
breaking bones
and drawing blood.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.718
Do you think that him
dabbling in this

05:52.820 --> 05:54.686
and messing around
with this stuff

05:54.788 --> 05:56.988
opened up doorways

05:57.091 --> 06:01.960
and -- and really angered
the other spirits that are here?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.462
Oh, yeah. I...

06:03.564 --> 06:06.264
You know, this house actually
had an exorcism performed on it

06:06.366 --> 06:07.866
by the Episcopal Church.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.168
-A full-on exorcism?
-Yeah.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.037
-[ Speaks indistinctly ]
-Why was an exorcism called?

06:12.139 --> 06:15.640
Just to rid out
any negativity in the house.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.210
-Mm-hmm.
-He was attacked a lot.

06:18.312 --> 06:21.146
I mean, there's so many
countless things

06:21.248 --> 06:24.716
that he might not have even
told people that have happened.
Mm-hmm.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.120
-You're a tour guide...
-I am.

06:28.222 --> 06:31.556
...at one of
the most haunted buildings

06:31.658 --> 06:33.825
in the country.
Yes.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.496
Is it true that something
picked you up and pushed you?

06:37.598 --> 06:39.731
-Yes.
-Where did this happen, Lisa?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.666
Mary Elizabeth Howard's room.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.969
The room took on
a...a heavy presence,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.438
is the best way
I know to describe it.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.874
And just all of a sudden,

06:48.976 --> 06:54.112
I was almost in the 1797 room
across the hall.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.481
ZAK: Sheriff Steven Howard
was the first person

06:56.583 --> 06:58.583
to build onto
this original structure.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.086
He took Mary Elizabeth
as his bride.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.855
She was only 12 years of age.
<i>[ Baby crying ]</i>

07:03.957 --> 07:07.292
Three years later,
she gave birth to a baby boy.

07:07.394 --> 07:10.595
But she would not see
her child's first birthday

07:10.697 --> 07:12.664
as she died in this very bed

07:12.766 --> 07:16.635
due to complications
from child birth.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.672
Something happens every single
day that I'm here.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.674
And I'm here 4 days
out of the week.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.843
ZAK: Jai Dobson and Kari Hobbs

07:24.945 --> 07:27.712
are docents
at the McRaven Mansion.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.147
Have you ever had
anything negative?

07:29.249 --> 07:32.150
Or has it been...
You have?

07:32.252 --> 07:34.452
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. [ Laughs ]

07:34.555 --> 07:35.954
I feel as though
there's something

07:36.056 --> 07:38.990
that you guys want
to tell me.

07:39.092 --> 07:42.761
Yeah. The very first time
that I came on this property,

07:42.863 --> 07:46.031
since I was a young girl,
I was hearing and feeling things

07:46.133 --> 07:48.033
that a normal young girl
should not.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.335
Initially, I never really
felt anything negative

07:50.437 --> 07:53.972
until I believe that
it was September or October

07:54.074 --> 07:56.608
that we had the investigation
where Lisa was pushed.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.277
And, Zak, I kept hearing
in my head,

07:59.379 --> 08:00.812
"I have you fooled."

08:00.914 --> 08:02.747
I'm gonna cry
talking about it.
It's okay.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.017
"I had you fooled.
I have you fooled."

08:06.119 --> 08:10.589
And I felt, um...here,
this kind of laughter.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.390
That bothered me.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.659
And I do not,
when I give tours any more,

08:14.761 --> 08:16.695
go into Andrew Glass' room.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.463
I don't get a very good feeling
from that

08:18.565 --> 08:22.100
because that's where
I was touched that night

08:22.202 --> 08:24.836
and had that happen.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.738
ZAK: Kari's traumatic event

08:26.840 --> 08:29.908
occurred here
in Andrew Glass' room.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.910
He was a murderous highwayman

08:32.012 --> 08:34.479
who had a fondness
for the ladies.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.315
One day, after suffering
a gunshot wound,

08:37.417 --> 08:40.018
he returned home
to his jealous wife,

08:40.120 --> 08:41.887
who slit his throat.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.222
Okay. Can I ask,
where were you touched?

08:44.324 --> 08:46.391
It felt like somebody
took their hand

08:46.493 --> 08:48.827
and slid it up
the inside of my thigh.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.696
But it was, um,
very uncomfortable.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.867
Unfortunately, that night
when I went home,

08:55.969 --> 08:58.536
I was attacked
in a nightmare.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.573
Can you tell me, how were
you attacked in the dream?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.942
I, basically, had a dream where
I was running from something.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.811
And I couldn't see what it was
that was chasing after me.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.980
And I passed
in front of a mirror,

09:09.082 --> 09:12.484
and what I saw was me,
but was not me.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.787
And I felt something
had ahold of me.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.889
And I-I could not control

09:17.991 --> 09:22.060
my -- my facial movements
or -- or anything.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.564
ZAK: It's clear something
in this house

09:26.667 --> 09:29.067
has a hold on Kari.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.402
I am worried.

09:30.504 --> 09:33.338
In the future, she may
find herself in a situation

09:33.440 --> 09:36.741
that could be dangerous for her.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.544
It's very hard to metal detect
on Civil War grounds.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.913
Getting a hit here. Did you
find anything yet, Aaron?

It's quiet.

10:05.798 --> 10:07.498
But just imagine,

you've got the Union army

to the Confederate
fortifications.

You don't know where to run.

10:17.643 --> 10:21.011
There's nowhere to hide.

You're a Confederate soldier

10:22.982 --> 10:25.315
and you know you're surrounded.

You've got gun boats

not only to be here in the town
and be invited by the mayor.

11:10.463 --> 11:13.931
It's very hard to metal detect
on any Civil War grounds.
Yeah.

And we have been given
special permission

11:17.570 --> 11:21.672
to metal detect
on the McRaven grounds.

11:21.774 --> 11:24.942
This was
a Confederate campsite.

11:25.044 --> 11:27.111
Cannon balls ripped through
that building.

11:27.213 --> 11:29.179
And the building still stands.

11:29.281 --> 11:33.183
And there are soldiers
buried on this property.

So let's start.

that could have killed them.

11:53.706 --> 11:55.739
You gotta realize
that the Civil War

11:55.841 --> 11:57.941
was over 150 years ago.

11:58.043 --> 11:59.810
And during that time,

11:59.912 --> 12:01.445
it can<i> really</i> be dug

-AARON: That's a human bone.
-Yeah.

12:43.422 --> 12:48.492
Aaron just found a human bone
on the McRaven property.

12:48.594 --> 12:50.928
ZAK: Dr. Reed was also
digging in this yard

12:51.030 --> 12:53.831
when he discovered
a full femur bone

12:53.933 --> 12:56.934

it took me

13:39.979 --> 13:41.678
to break this branch
with a shovel

13:41.780 --> 13:43.013
to get this little nail?

You gotta have patience
when you metal detect.

15:03.495 --> 15:04.928
When I did get the bone,
I kind of felt like,

15:05.030 --> 15:07.164
"Oh, should I go put it back
in the spot?"

15:07.266 --> 15:10.334

it's, like, dedicated, too.

This appears to be ammunition

15:24.950 --> 15:27.751
for a musket called
buck and ball.

the destructive nature
of a bullet

with a larger target area

22:16.252 --> 22:19.453
was on the run from authorities
when he was shot and wounded.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.389
He made his way
back to this room

22:21.491 --> 22:25.760
where Keri is right now
capturing an EVP in this moment.

22:25.862 --> 22:28.596
Andrew Glass' wife
then slit his throat

22:28.698 --> 22:30.197
while he lay in bed.

22:30.300 --> 22:34.268
-You have frightened her.
-And touched me.

22:42.245 --> 22:44.779
ZAK: If that's you,
can you show yourself to her?

22:44.881 --> 22:48.983
Is this Andrew telling us
that he has come here to die?

22:51.387 --> 22:54.422
¶¶

22:57.660 --> 23:00.861
As all three of us reach
the second-floor landing,

23:00.963 --> 23:04.265
it's as if we get caught
in a spiritual-type trance,

23:04.367 --> 23:07.001
frozen in position,
just standing here.

23:07.103 --> 23:08.669
Something doesn't feel right.

23:08.771 --> 23:11.105
I want to see
if someone else's energy

23:11.207 --> 23:12.873
will create a ripple effect.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.775
Jai, can you come up here?

23:17.246 --> 23:18.546
Can you move down a little?

23:21.651 --> 23:23.451
Jai, you want
to come on up here?

23:23.553 --> 23:26.020
Ooh.

23:26.122 --> 23:27.755
You all right?

23:27.857 --> 23:30.624
How does it feel from someone
that's been outside

23:30.727 --> 23:33.861
to come into this right now?

23:36.499 --> 23:37.631
I know this might
sound strange,

23:37.734 --> 23:39.600
but is it okay
if I walk in her room?

23:42.605 --> 23:45.005
-What are you feeling now?
-KARI: Careful.

23:50.313 --> 23:52.480
You okay? Huh?

23:53.616 --> 23:55.649
ZAK: Jai is
shaking uncontrollably

23:55.752 --> 23:59.320
and seeks safety by going inside
Mary Elizabeth's room,

23:59.422 --> 24:04.024
who died during her pregnancy
in September of 1836.

24:04.127 --> 24:07.461
Why am I so, like,
just agitated with everybody?

24:07.563 --> 24:09.296
Like, I'm not...
I don't know.

24:09.399 --> 24:13.601
It's -- Is it bad energy in this
hallway or is it just me?

24:15.338 --> 24:17.338

Jai, are you okay?

24:26.449 --> 24:27.782
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.651
Are you the spirit that
was attacking Leyland French?

24:30.753 --> 24:33.354
Leyland French
was the previous owner

24:33.456 --> 24:36.657
who was attacked so badly
by malevolent spirits

24:36.759 --> 24:38.893
that they drew blood
and broke bones,

24:38.995 --> 24:41.595
forcing the house
to be exorcised by a priest.

24:41.697 --> 24:42.863
All right, listen,

24:42.965 --> 24:44.665
Aaron's gonna turn
the spirit box on, okay?

24:44.767 --> 24:48.202
-Okay.
-AARON: There's no way...

24:48.304 --> 24:49.637

to have brand-new batteries

24:53.009 --> 24:55.009
suddenly and mysteriously drain.

24:55.111 --> 24:56.844
This begins frustrating me,

24:56.946 --> 25:04.118
and the energy inside here
is giving me rage.

25:04.220 --> 25:05.719
Mary, can you hear us?

25:05.822 --> 25:07.755
Why are you making us
feel this way?

25:07.857 --> 25:09.824
Somebody was whispering

Billy, and myself make our way

33:29.250 --> 33:31.117
over to the other side
of the mansion,

33:31.219 --> 33:33.953
where the former owner,
Leyland French, used to sleep

33:34.055 --> 33:37.457
when he suffered numerous
attacks by dark spirits.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.025
Hold on.

33:40.895 --> 33:43.529
Somebody up these stairs?

33:43.631 --> 33:45.631
John Bobb,

33:45.733 --> 33:48.201
were you killed
by some Union soldiers?

33:56.911 --> 33:58.244
[ Loud bang ]

33:58.346 --> 34:00.346
-Did -- did you hear that?
-Yeah.

34:00.448 --> 34:03.015
-BILLY: That was loud.
-That was loud.

34:04.552 --> 34:07.553
[ Whispers ]
What the hell is that?
[ Speaks indistinctly ]

34:08.923 --> 34:10.790
[ Loud banging ]

34:10.892 --> 34:12.892
-What is that?
-Yeah. [ Speaks indistinctly ]

34:12.994 --> 34:14.193
BILLY: That's what
I'm talking about.

34:14.295 --> 34:16.395
ZAK: All of us start hearing
strange noises

34:16.498 --> 34:20.399
coming from the master bedroom
upstairs to the left.

34:23.037 --> 34:24.103
<i>What?</i>

34:24.205 --> 34:25.538
We have no X camera
in that room,

34:25.640 --> 34:28.107
but what we discover
when we step inside

34:28.209 --> 34:30.810
is absolutely mind-blowing.

34:30.912 --> 34:33.913
Oh, god. There's a picture
of John Bobb.

34:34.015 --> 34:35.781
-Yes, that's him.
-The other side...

34:35.884 --> 34:37.483
-And the other side is...
-Him and his wife.

34:37.585 --> 34:39.852
KARI: John Bobb was murdered
by Union soldiers.

34:39.954 --> 34:42.722
And they shot him in the back
and they shot him in the cheek.

34:42.824 --> 34:44.590
And now, what we'll say,
"If you look over here

34:44.692 --> 34:46.058
to the left the bed,

34:46.161 --> 34:49.862
the lamp that was sitting on
the table is now on the floor."

34:49.964 --> 34:52.698
It was not like that when
walked out of this room earlier.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.400
And I was one of the last people
that came up here.

34:54.502 --> 34:56.169
-What?
-Why is the lamp on the floor?

34:56.271 --> 34:58.671
I have no idea.

34:58.773 --> 35:00.039
This lamp?

35:00.141 --> 35:02.341
That lamp is supposed to be
on that stand right there.

35:02.443 --> 35:04.777
-Right here?
-Yes. Just like that.

35:04.879 --> 35:06.846
Yeah. There's a twin
on this side of the bed.

35:06.948 --> 35:09.081
BILLY: Oh, yeah.
The other one's where it goes.

35:09.184 --> 35:11.851
I wonder if that's the shuffling
noises we heard up here.

35:11.953 --> 35:14.387
Oh, my.

35:14.489 --> 35:17.990
Oh. Wait.
There's something in the floor.

35:18.092 --> 35:19.358
-Can you guys stamp here?
-ZAK: What?

35:19.460 --> 35:20.526
I just stepped
on something in the floor.

35:20.628 --> 35:22.428
-What -- what is that?
-Right here.

35:22.530 --> 35:26.165
Guys, right under my foot,
what is that?

35:26.267 --> 35:27.500
ZAK: What the hell?

35:27.602 --> 35:29.802
-BILLY: It's pieces of brick.
-It's pieces of brick.

35:29.904 --> 35:31.170
-From what?
-From what?

35:31.272 --> 35:32.572
Because I just stepped on it,
and it crunched.

35:32.674 --> 35:36.142
-Yeah. I heard it.
-Wow.

35:36.244 --> 35:37.543
BILLY:
I'm confused at why this lamp

35:37.645 --> 35:40.513
is just sitting here
on the floor like that.

35:41.950 --> 35:44.517
Wait, what?
There's more furniture moved?

35:45.853 --> 35:48.821
That table, it's here,
beside here.

35:50.592 --> 35:51.757
Here.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.961
ZAK: The lamp on the floor,
the pieces of brick,

35:55.063 --> 35:56.829
and a table that's been moved --

35:56.931 --> 35:58.764
this is amazing
because we believe

35:58.866 --> 36:00.366
it's what we heard moving

36:00.468 --> 36:02.969
while we were standing on
the stairs moments ago.

36:03.071 --> 36:05.805
And yes, we are extremely mad

36:05.907 --> 36:10.476
we did not put one of our
X cameras inside this room.

36:10.578 --> 36:12.712
<i>-Did -- did you hear that?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

36:13.781 --> 36:15.348
Who is inside Jai?

36:15.450 --> 36:17.650
There is an energy
that you can feel.

36:17.752 --> 36:19.518
-It's circling us right now.
-Whoa! Whoa!

36:19.621 --> 36:20.853
<i>[ Cannon fires ]</i>

¶¶

36:26.495 --> 36:29.663
ZAK: Here's a special look
at our next Hauntings of
Vicksburg investigation.

36:29.765 --> 36:33.233
The husband has recently claimed
that he has woken

36:33.335 --> 36:35.302
to something on him,
sitting on him.

36:36.972 --> 36:38.738
He felt like it was
something demonic.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.273
A demon.

36:40.375 --> 36:42.475
WOMAN: Like something
was gonna kill him.

36:42.577 --> 36:44.811
ZAK: Who are you?

36:44.913 --> 36:48.882
A haunted doll that has ties
to the Holocaust.

36:51.253 --> 36:53.887
Can you hear me?
Is that you that I feel?

36:59.394 --> 37:01.094
<i>[ Cannon fires ]</i>

37:01.196 --> 37:03.596
ZAK: It's getting very late
here in Vicksburg,

37:03.699 --> 37:07.167
but the McRaven Mansion
is not through with us yet.

37:09.304 --> 37:11.638
<i>-Did you hear that?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

37:11.740 --> 37:14.374
ZAK: To get some answers,
we immediately conduct

37:14.476 --> 37:16.776
a Paranormal Puck 2 session.

37:16.878 --> 37:20.313
This device allows spirits
to select words from a database

37:20.415 --> 37:23.717
by using their energy within
the electromagnetic fields.

37:23.819 --> 37:26.186
There is an energy
that you can feel.

37:26.288 --> 37:28.054
You need to go to it
because that will

37:28.156 --> 37:30.490
allow you
to communicate with us.

37:30.592 --> 37:33.827
I decide to let Jai hold
the Paranormal Puck sensor

37:33.929 --> 37:36.029
because throughout
tonight's investigation,

37:36.131 --> 37:40.400
she has had the most personal
and physical experiences.

37:40.502 --> 37:43.169
ZAK: Who is inside Jai?

37:45.941 --> 37:47.941
No response.

37:48.043 --> 37:50.610
Tell us that you're here
and answer this correctly.

37:50.712 --> 37:54.347
The loud thing
that's passing us, what is it?

37:57.652 --> 37:59.886
F? The heck is that?

37:59.988 --> 38:01.121
BILLY: Have you ever
seen it do that?

38:01.223 --> 38:03.256
I don't know.
Just a letter F?

38:03.358 --> 38:05.258
What is passing us?

38:07.129 --> 38:08.695
-JAI: Oh, my God.
-KARI: Oh, my Jesus.

38:08.797 --> 38:10.397
What is that? What?

38:11.800 --> 38:13.800
KARI: It's Mr. French...

38:13.902 --> 38:15.568
Oh, my gosh.

38:15.670 --> 38:16.703
-Ohh. Did you feel that?
-Yeah.

38:16.805 --> 38:18.705
Did you feel..
Wait, do you feel wind?

38:18.807 --> 38:20.040
-Yeah.
-In this room?
-On my hands.

38:20.142 --> 38:22.675
Leyland French is passing you
right now.

38:22.778 --> 38:25.178
Ohh.
It's circling us right now.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:26.715 --> 38:28.181
-Circling us.
-As we are in the room

38:28.283 --> 38:30.216
where the past owner,
Leyland French,

38:30.318 --> 38:33.553
slept and suffered
many violent attacks,

38:33.655 --> 38:36.189
resulting in an exorcism
on the house,

38:36.291 --> 38:38.625
all of us,
including both Jai and Kari,

38:38.727 --> 38:42.729
think that Leyland passed away
after he moved out of the house.

38:42.831 --> 38:45.565
But we find out
he is still alive.

38:45.667 --> 38:48.134
Is whatever
evil or demonic entity

38:48.236 --> 38:50.270
that caused him so much harm

38:50.372 --> 38:52.772
the one we are actually
communicating with

38:52.874 --> 38:55.775
and who is only mimicking
Leyland French?

38:55.877 --> 38:56.776
Come on, Leyland.

38:56.878 --> 38:58.745
I need you to answer this,
buddy.

38:58.847 --> 39:01.714
You got spirits here
that are affecting two women.

39:01.817 --> 39:04.551
They work here. You need to help
give 'em answers.

39:04.653 --> 39:07.854
What did you use
to see the spirits?

39:09.658 --> 39:11.558
-What the...
-Stones?

39:11.660 --> 39:13.293
What'd we just find
on the carpet?

39:13.395 --> 39:15.161
People used stones,
different stones

39:15.263 --> 39:16.896
for different energies,
like Jai said,

39:16.998 --> 39:18.498
when they do communications.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.367
Leyland, what did you use
to see the spirits?

39:21.470 --> 39:23.303
BILLY AND ZAK: Stones.

39:23.405 --> 39:27.807
Leyland, what parts of the body
did the spirits harm on you?

39:27.909 --> 39:29.476
Leyland, what parts
of the body

39:29.578 --> 39:31.211
did the spirits harm
on you?

39:32.314 --> 39:34.848
Oh...my...God.

39:34.950 --> 39:36.716
Are you kidding me?

39:36.818 --> 39:39.185
You're having a text session
with Leyland.

39:39.287 --> 39:41.788
What are the odds
you get a body part

39:41.890 --> 39:44.057
answering that damn question?
What?

39:44.159 --> 39:47.527
That's extremely,
scarily accurate.

39:47.629 --> 39:50.830
¶¶

39:50.932 --> 39:52.799
So want to talk to you guys

39:52.901 --> 39:56.803
because we did capture
a lot of evidence.

39:56.905 --> 39:58.404
The reason
why I have you here

39:58.507 --> 40:00.006
is because
a piece of evidence

40:00.108 --> 40:01.808
that I'm going to share
with you

40:01.910 --> 40:03.877

on a personal level.

in Andrew Glass' room.

something touch you?
