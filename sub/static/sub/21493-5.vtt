00:09.926 --> 00:12.303
[Sam]  Before I started working
at Techtropolis,

00:12.387 --> 00:14.347
I learned everything about it...

00:14.431 --> 00:16.349
the products they sell,

00:16.433 --> 00:18.768
the rules and procedures for employees,

00:19.686 --> 00:22.897
how not to tell customers
they smell bad even if they do.

00:23.189 --> 00:26.192
And I had a sit-down with Bob,
the manager,

00:26.276 --> 00:28.778
who has hairy knuckles, but is nice.

00:28.862 --> 00:29.904
Sam?

00:30.655 --> 00:32.365
Your shift ended 20 minutes ago.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.034
Is everything okay?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.368
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.912
I had curly fries for lunch,
and I have a girlfriend now.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.249
Okay. [chuckles] Wow!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.252
Congratulations. Tell me about her.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.880
-You know, what's the lucky lady's name?
-Which one?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.047
Your girlfriend.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.885
Oh. Her name is Paige,
and she has blonde hair.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.179
She's bossy and touches all of my stuff.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.139
She was born in New Jersey

00:56.222 --> 00:59.809
in the same town as Queen Latifah,
and she's coming over today after work.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.647
Oh, yeah. I get it.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.774
[chuckles]

01:05.857 --> 01:07.442
I have a wife, so...

01:07.525 --> 01:08.401
[chuckles]

01:09.861 --> 01:11.571
You take all the time you need.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.992
[Sam]  I don't always love new things,

01:16.076 --> 01:18.912
but that's just a smart survival instinct.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.207
Do you think that a bearded seal
would last very long

01:22.290 --> 01:24.959
if it said, "Well, I've never
seen that animal before

01:25.043 --> 01:27.253
with the sharp teeth
and beautiful white fur.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.838
I'll walk over and meet him."

01:29.923 --> 01:31.090
No.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.636
No, he wouldn't, because that's how
you become a polar bear's dinner.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.234
[blowing]

01:50.819 --> 01:52.070
[continues blowing]

01:54.364 --> 01:56.783
-You nervous about tomorrow?
-No.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.535
Oh, you're, like, freaking out.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.911
Kind of.

01:59.994 --> 02:03.581
Well, hey,
just remember they recruited you.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.377
So just, you know, keep your pants on
and don't curse so much. You'll be fine.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.879
I have to keep my pants on
at the interview, really?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.006
Yeah, call me old fashioned, but...

02:12.090 --> 02:15.802
I know that the athletic department
wants me, but I still have the interview.

02:15.885 --> 02:19.180
And then I need to prove that I'm not
just a dum-dum who can run fast.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.725
Hey, you're not just a dum-dum
that can run fast. You're also very hot.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.019
[chuckles]

02:26.980 --> 02:28.398
It feels like a big deal.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.860
Yeah, well, I mean, it is a big deal.
It is.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.528
Be nervous, that's okay.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.197
You'll be fine.

02:40.743 --> 02:41.703
[chuckles]

02:48.293 --> 02:49.752
[Elsa] Door open!

02:49.836 --> 02:52.463

It's like she has a nanny cam in here.

-The laundry room. I'm running the dryer.

That's a loud dryer.

Listen, the last time we spoke,

03:28.833 --> 03:31.836
I made it very, very clear
that we are done.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.380
Why are you doing inviting me
to your birthday party?

Shit.

Yeah, um, sorry about that.
You weren't supposed to get that.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.347
I wasn't?

03:42.430 --> 03:45.350
No, I accidentally sent that out
to my entire address book.

I, uh, might have been a bit stoned
when I sent it.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.274
I just got it two minutes ago.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.401
Yeah, I might be a little bit stoned now.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.780
Okay. Great, I'm gonna hang up now.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.407
Um, Nick?

04:01.491 --> 04:02.408
Mm-hmm.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.077
Um, I'm sorry...

04:05.119 --> 04:06.204
about the other night.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.082
I shouldn't have called you
a terrible person.

04:09.165 --> 04:12.168
Yeah. You hurt my feelings.
Come over and apologize.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.461
Shut up.

04:13.544 --> 04:17.382
I'm saying I shouldn't have blamed you
for what happened between us.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.549
It was my fault, too.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.178
It's just made me realize how precious

04:22.262 --> 04:25.390
and fragile my family is, you know?

04:25.473 --> 04:27.725
It's like a wake-up call,
because since then,

04:27.809 --> 04:30.520
I feel like I've been
more present and kind.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.440
Hey, you know what? I'm actually at work
right now, so I can't talk, but uh...

04:34.524 --> 04:36.526
-See you at my birthday party?
-What?

04:36.609 --> 04:37.443

04:43.574 --> 04:45.410
[Julia]  I'm disappointed at myself.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.500
This isn't me. I'm better than this.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.296
I'm not a snooping, paranoid girlfriend.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.257
But I'm, like, 90% sure
he's hiding something from me.

04:59.340 --> 05:02.343
I spent all night Googling those
car tracker thingys from  Breaking Bad.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.846
All of this for a strawberry.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.432
A chocolate-covered strawberry.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.809
That's a sexually charged fruit.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.185
He's cheating on me.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.896
As someone with a PhD
in clinical psychology,

05:13.980 --> 05:15.982
my formal diagnosis for you

05:16.065 --> 05:17.900
is you're cray.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.860
I am not!

05:18.943 --> 05:20.445
If you guys were in a good place,

05:20.528 --> 05:22.530
this strawberry would be
something you'd laugh off.

05:22.613 --> 05:26.534
But it's been five years,
he still hasn't proposed,

05:26.617 --> 05:29.704
and it's making you, well, cray.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.040
No, this isn't about him proposing.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.375
This is about that damn strawberry.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.711
Fine. Your worst fears are confirmed.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.380
He bought those strawberries
for some other girl,

05:39.464 --> 05:40.923
and they're getting married.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.759
You should probably live in a ditch.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.595
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.

05:47.096 --> 05:47.930
Okay.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.103
Hey, you two.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.272
Paige, I didn't expect to see you today.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.815
She waited for me at the bus stop,

05:57.899 --> 06:00.401
and she made me carry her Thermos,
which is nickel-plated,

06:00.485 --> 06:02.653
so it was very cold.
She talked the whole way.

06:02.737 --> 06:06.491
-This is the first time she's not talking.
-It's true. [chuckles]

06:06.574 --> 06:08.493
You are spending a lot of time together.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.203
Well, that's what couples do.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.665
Couples. "That's what couples do."
Sounds very official.

06:15.374 --> 06:18.294
Oh. Well, actually, I brought a snack.

06:18.377 --> 06:22.298
But it's that dense, chewy kind,
that maybe you can't eat the whole thing.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.925
So, do you want to go halfsies?

06:24.008 --> 06:27.303
We could be like Arctic foxes
sharing food with our den mates.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.680
Card.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.767
[Paige] Thank you.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.189
It's a system I developed so Sam doesn't
annoy people with Antarctica facts.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.817
I give him three cards
at the beginning of every day,

06:40.900 --> 06:43.152
and when he talks about Antarctica,
I take one away.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.864
When he's out of cards, he can't talk
about it anymore. Right, Sam?

06:46.948 --> 06:48.950
I decorated it with puffy paint.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.577
Sam, are you okay with this?

06:51.661 --> 06:55.206
I think it's dumb, but other people seem
to be happy, mostly Paige.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.797
Arctic foxes tend
to form monogamous pairs...

07:02.880 --> 07:08.469
and their litters can contain
as many as 25 kits.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.846
Twenty-five!

07:10.346 --> 07:11.347
Wow!

07:11.431 --> 07:14.517
I'm actually not surprised
that it's a little bit messy in here.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.769
I've been doing research,
and while some think

07:16.853 --> 07:20.022
that people on the spectrum
are always neat, sometimes they're not.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.860
[Sam]  Can you imagine sharing a space
with 25 other foxes?

07:23.943 --> 07:26.154
Portland, Oregon.
I have a second cousin there.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.030
-[Sam]  It'd be chaos.
-It's a blizzard!

07:28.114 --> 07:29.240
Spin. Ooh, a compass.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.575
You're right at north!

07:30.658 --> 07:34.745
[chirps] Whoa, look at this! This is cool.
Blast from the past.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.622
What kind of batteries does this take?

07:36.706 --> 07:39.500
Ooh, helicopters.
I like to call these choppers.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.127
What's this cool sculpture?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.504
Is it a sculpture?
How many of these would fit in...

07:43.588 --> 07:45.923
It could be a hat!
Should we see? So many books.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.676
You can store trinkets in here.
I use a highlighter for...

07:48.759 --> 07:52.722
This would look better by your bed.
Ooh, what's this blue thing?

07:52.805 --> 07:54.640
Your pencils... Right here.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.517
[Sam]  I wouldn't like sharing my den.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.060
Oh!

07:58.853 --> 08:00.938
Look at this little guy.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.899
Somebody wants to snuggle.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.901
No! Do not snuggle Edison.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.321
Hey, buddy!

08:13.409 --> 08:14.744
Hey, Sam, what's going on?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.579
[Paige] Hi, Mr. Gardner!

08:18.498 --> 08:21.209
-Is there a lady in your closet?
-Yes. Paige.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.003
She was touching all of my stuff,
so I locked her in there.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.547
[Paige] Hey, uh, can I get
some pretzels in here?

08:26.631 --> 08:30.134
No. Sam, move.
You don't lock girls in your closet.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.761
Paige, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.012
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.138
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.891
Sam, apologize to Paige right now, okay?
Say you're sorry.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.684
But I'm not. I did what I needed to do.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.645
-Sam!
-It's okay.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.939
I know from my research
that sometimes people

08:43.022 --> 08:44.690
with ASD have outsized reactions to stuff.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.735
I mean, let's be honest, I know that...

08:47.818 --> 08:50.029
I can be a handful,
even for neurotypicals.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.324
So, I figured I'd give Sam a break
to recharge his batteries.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.660
It was only ten minutes. That's nothing.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.371
Researchers
at Antarctica's Halley VI Station

08:58.454 --> 09:00.957
live in 24-hour darkness for months.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.083
Last one.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.000
Card.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.423
I should probably get home.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.219
Oh, and Sam, I refolded all of your socks
in a totally better way. Bye.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.597
Bye, Paige.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.644
Sam, that... that's weird.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.022
Hey, Dad, did Mom used
to touch all of your stuff?

09:25.106 --> 09:26.566
How did you get her to stop?

09:27.817 --> 09:29.151
Um...

09:29.235 --> 09:30.111
[chuckles]

09:30.194 --> 09:31.904
I don't think I ever did.

09:32.863 --> 09:33.698
Hmm.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.000
Oh, my gosh. Look at you.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.835
You look so pretty.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.839
-Maybe different shoes.
-Mom.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.845
Honey, I want you to know that
I am fully on board

09:56.554 --> 09:58.264
for you to attend Clayton Prep.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.017
Oh, yeah?
Does this have anything to do

10:01.100 --> 10:04.395
with the five-hour conversation
that you and Dad had the other day?

10:04.478 --> 10:06.731
It took me some time, but I got there.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.527
And the distance and the money and Sam,
we'll figure it out.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.863
Oh, that reminds me. Sam?

10:16.616 --> 10:20.328
We have the Clayton tour, so I won't be
in school to give you your lunch money.

10:20.411 --> 10:24.373
But Evan's sister Beth will hold onto it
and find you during fifth period.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.750
Do you know who Beth is?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.170
Yes, she talks loud.
Why are you wearing a dress?

10:29.253 --> 10:33.049
Do they need to see how muscly your legs
are to know if they want you on the team?

10:33.132 --> 10:36.927
Let's go. You don't want to be late
before you actually go to the school.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.347
Look. You're wearing the Clayton colors.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.058
That is not on purpose.
You wear that shirt every day.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.768
Still, he looks very nice.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.022
We're a beautiful family.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.165
I don't know, but don't jinx it.
You look good.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.750
-Let's go.
-Thanks.

[Elsa] I heard the guide
call this the Peace Garden.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.894
It's so beautiful here.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.646
Very nice. It's very fancy.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.025
I bet you these people eat cashews.
You know, cashews is the rich man's nut.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.778
Yeah, they even had real towels
in the girls' bathroom.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.613
This place is classy.

11:37.696 --> 11:40.491
-We're classy.
-Middle classy.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.327
Honey, you've always been
so mature and sophisticated.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.745
You'll fit right in here.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.164
Mom, I punched a girl
in the face two weeks ago.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.166
Honey, they don't know that, okay?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.709
Look. Look at that girl.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.546
In her little uniform,
marching towards her future

11:53.629 --> 11:55.381
with that big backpack.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.924
That's gonna be you next year.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.176
Fresh start.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.480
Hi, Sam.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.736
That's my sweatshirt.
You're wearing my sweatshirt.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.655
When I was locked in your closet,
I got cold, so I put it on.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.533
But it was so cute and cozy
that I decided to steal it.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.827
I love it.
It's like you're hugging me all day.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.871
But that's my sweatshirt.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.539
[gasps] I had the best idea!

12:28.622 --> 12:30.458
-Do you want to hear it?
-Sweatshirt.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.545
You could drop your study hall and take
French with me. Sam, it would be so fun.

12:34.628 --> 12:37.173
And it's the most romantic language
in the world.

12:37.256 --> 12:41.844
And who knows?
Maybe one day, we could travel to Paris

12:41.927 --> 12:44.472
and kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower
or something.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.639

They can run...

12:52.897 --> 12:54.023
they can attack...

12:58.569 --> 12:59.904

13:12.625 --> 13:13.918
Casey.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.711
I'm Jayson. Nice to meet you.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.214
Hey. You, too. You look familiar.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.299
I'm black,
so they put me on the brochures.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.801
-Oh, yeah, that's it.
-Come on.

13:22.885 --> 13:23.719
Okay.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.306
So we do peer interviews here.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.892
It's supposed to make you
feel more comfortable,

13:29.975 --> 13:33.020
and I must be crushing it
because you seem comfortable, so...

13:33.103 --> 13:34.855
Oh, um...

13:34.939 --> 13:38.400
I'm-- I swear I'm just like a little--
completely nervous.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.320
It's just my other school
is not this nice.

You guys don't have a yoga room
or bio-sustainable duck pond?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.951
No. No, we don't.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.411
Look, I get it.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.331
But this place is pretty cool
once you get used to it.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.175
Hey, Beth, what's going on?

14:03.259 --> 14:06.345
I know I was supposed to give Sam
his lunch money, but I can't find him.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.931
-I don't know where he is.
-Okay, calm down. Um...

14:09.014 --> 14:12.226
-What about Paige, did you ask her?
-Yeah. She hasn't seen him.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.479
Now he'll miss lunch,
the second-most important meal of the day.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.439
Okay. That's okay. I'm gonna text him.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.857
Thank you for trying, Beth.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.027
Seriously? I knew you were nervous,
but picking up a phone call

14:22.111 --> 14:24.363
during an interview,
and now you're texting.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.324
-Are you trying to blow this?
-My brother's autistic.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.495
Well, I'm a dick.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.247
No, that's okay. You didn't know.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.917
I just have to answer my phone in case
he's freaking out or he disappeared,

14:37.001 --> 14:38.627
which is what happened right now.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.337
It's kind of my job as his sister.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.798
That must be hard for you.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.467
-Yeah, it has its moments.
-[cell phone buzzes]

14:45.551 --> 14:49.471

from his girlfriend in the science lab.

[both laugh]

14:52.016 --> 14:53.601
Okay. Seems like we're all good.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.727
Wow.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.729
Okay, so...

14:57.771 --> 14:59.732
you said that it has its moments.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.025
Mm-hmm.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.234
Tell me about 'em.

15:03.485 --> 15:04.612
Okay.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.031
Well...

15:09.658 --> 15:11.243
So when I was growing up,

15:11.785 --> 15:13.746
my mom and brother used to refer to people

15:13.829 --> 15:16.707
who weren't on the spectrum
as neurotypicals...

15:16.790 --> 15:18.500
"NTs" for short.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.046
But when I was little, I always thought
that they were saying "empties,"

15:22.838 --> 15:24.798
which made sense because...

15:26.133 --> 15:27.885
sometimes it feels like

15:27.968 --> 15:30.054
Sam takes up so much space

15:30.638 --> 15:33.474
that everybody around him needs
to be empty.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.105
Sorry, I don't know why I told you that.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.608
If you were to come here,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.944
what's it going to be like
to leave your brother?

15:47.154 --> 15:49.949
I don't know. I never did it before.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.578
I don't want her to be cold,

15:54.662 --> 15:56.789
I want her
to be a comfortable temperature.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.708
But it's my sweatshirt, and I need it.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.461
Wh-- when I'm anxious, especially,
or overwhelmed,

16:02.544 --> 16:05.089
because that's why I have it
in the first place.

16:11.095 --> 16:14.515
Are you just gonna sit there staring,
because it's super weird.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.016

Be cool, babe.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.310

with his girlfriend.

-Practice girlfriend.
-See? It's weird.

you're great at this stuff.

get back to the cha-cha. Arr.

Fine.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.077
Look, I don't know this chick,
but girls like to wear something

16:35.160 --> 16:37.955
that reminds them of their boyfriend
when he's not around.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.749
But I need my sweatshirt.
How do I get it back?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.711
I don't know, maybe give her
something else to replace it.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.757

-I told you, dude.

for half price, except scrotes.

It's about your brother Sam.

[chuckles]

18:56.844 --> 18:58.220
Yeah. Um...

18:58.762 --> 19:01.765
It's just I think maybe he's avoiding me

19:01.849 --> 19:05.352
because we were talking yesterday, and...

19:06.103 --> 19:07.896
I don't know, maybe I upset him,

19:07.980 --> 19:10.357

just disappeared after that.

I don't know, maybe it's nothing.

It's not nothing, because of you,
he didn't eat lunch yesterday.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.106
I love you.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.112
Apparently, I like Paige.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.073
Apparently, I like it when you knock.

22:46.156 --> 22:49.242
And now she's not my girlfriend
because of you. You drove her away.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.745
Okay, well, all you do
is complain about her.

22:52.329 --> 22:55.165
-And I get it; she's super-annoying.
-Well, I like her, I think.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.835
And you're my little sister,
and I don't need you messing with my life.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.046
Oh, my God! I was just trying to help.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.423
I'm not always gonna be around
to stick up for you.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.133
-Good.
-Sam...

23:05.217 --> 23:07.636
No, you're just like Paige.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.722
But instead of touching my books
and my turtle,

23:10.806 --> 23:14.059
you're touching my girlfriend.
I'm glad you're going to that new school,

23:14.142 --> 23:15.977
because you will not be around
to bother me.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.730
-You don't mean that.
-Yes, I do.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.399
I don't need you.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.068
-Well, good! That's what I wanted.
-Well, good!

23:28.281 --> 23:29.866
[cell phone buzzing]

23:34.955 --> 23:37.874
-Hello?
-Hey, Casey, it's Jayson...

23:37.958 --> 23:40.210
from Clayton Prep.
I just got your e-mail.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.170
Oh. Hi.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.255
You guys are prompt.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.465
[chuckles] Yeah, well...

23:45.549 --> 23:49.761
Look, I just wanted to call
to say I think you're awesome.

23:49.845 --> 23:50.679
But?

23:51.847 --> 23:52.973
But...

23:53.807 --> 23:57.727
I work at the admissions office,
and I've been hearing some people talk.

23:57.811 --> 23:58.770
You punched a girl?

24:00.480 --> 24:01.314
Oh.

24:02.065 --> 24:05.152
Yeah. But you don't know the whole story.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.945
She was bullying somebody.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.239
Okay, okay, okay, look.

24:09.322 --> 24:12.325
Write a letter to the admissions office,
and I'll do what I can.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.370
But Clayton has a zero tolerance policy
on violence.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.247
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.207
I have to go.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.049
Hey, babe.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.344
Miles?

24:48.278 --> 24:53.533
And that is our youngest granddaughter,
Charlie, which is short for Charlotte.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.869
-[Doug] Cute.
-I don't know. These names lately, right?

24:55.952 --> 25:00.540
Yeah, Casey, when she was in kindergarten,
there was a child named Key.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.750
-Right.
-Yeah.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.669
-A boy or a girl?
-We weren't sure for the first few months.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.962
[laughing]

25:06.046 --> 25:09.174
But she was a girl. Cute girl, nice.
They were friends. Nice girl.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.259
-Very sweet.
-So how are your kids?

25:11.968 --> 25:13.678
-Really good.
-Yeah.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.556
Casey is getting recruited
by that school Clayton Prep.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.391
-Oh.
-For a track scholarship.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.560
Yeah, we went for a tour
the other day, on the campus.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.020
-Scholarship.
-Yeah. It'd be great.

25:22.562 --> 25:25.398
-[Donna] Exciting.
-Yeah, it's nice to spend time with Casey,

25:25.482 --> 25:28.526
'cause, you know, we're usually
so focused on Sam and so...

25:28.610 --> 25:30.737
-Why? What's going on with Sam?
-He's good.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.489
-You want more sangria?
-I'm okay.

25:32.572 --> 25:37.118
He doesn't tell me anything anymore.
Right? I have become obsolete. He's 18.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.036
[Donna] Oh.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.162
You know, so...

25:39.829 --> 25:43.250
You know, it's like girls and dating.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.043
-[Chuck] Trouble, trouble.
-Mm-hmm.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.795
-Mm-hmm.
-[Elsa] Yeah.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.798
Especially with Sam,
everything's a bit more, you know...

25:49.881 --> 25:50.966
No, what?

25:51.716 --> 25:53.051
Mm, 'cause of his autism.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.135
[Donna] What?

25:54.970 --> 25:55.804
Sam's autistic?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.140
Yeah.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.521
Um...

26:09.567 --> 26:12.487
[Elsa] You worked with Chuck
for over five years.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.197
The subject never came up?

26:14.281 --> 26:16.700
No, Chuck and I don't really
talk about that stuff.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.619
Uh-huh. I get it.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.704
You get what?

26:20.787 --> 26:22.038
It's like my friend Diego.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.083
Do you remember Diego
from when I worked with him at the salon?

26:25.166 --> 26:26.001
Yeah.

26:26.084 --> 26:29.045
It took him over a year
to tell me he was gay.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.840
He still carries a lot of shame
about his sexuality.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.593
It's a big deal for him to be out at work.

26:34.676 --> 26:37.762
Well, he works in a hair salon,
and he's not comfortable being gay?

26:37.846 --> 26:41.975
It's the same with you. You're not out
at work because you're ashamed.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.268
No, I'm not ashamed.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.520
Elsa, I'm not ashamed of anything.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.230
Okay?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.024
I just like to keep my work life

26:49.107 --> 26:51.443
and my personal life separate.
I'm not ashamed.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.862
-Mm-hmm.
-It's just how I am. It's a guy thing.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.072
Yeah, I just could never be that way,

26:56.156 --> 26:59.367
not with someone I work with every day,
someone I'm friends with.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.077
It's a huge part of my identity.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.121
-Yeah, but maybe it shouldn't be.
-What?

27:03.204 --> 27:06.207
Everything with you revolves
around being a mom.

27:06.291 --> 27:10.003
And maybe sometime you should just,
you know, be like an individual person.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.088
I am an individual person.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.423
No, I don't think you are.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.884
Everything is Sam this and autism that.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.428
Maybe it's time to step back
and have your own life.

27:23.058 --> 27:26.019
It takes me a while
to get used to new things.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.396
But once I get used to something,

27:29.105 --> 27:30.273
I come to rely on it.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.075
[woman speaking French]

27:41.201 --> 27:42.118
Paige?

27:42.202 --> 27:44.162
[in French]  Pardon, monsieur...

27:44.245 --> 27:46.956
-Sam, what are you doing here?
-En Français.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.251
Uh, Sam,  que fais-tu ici ?

27:50.335 --> 27:52.754
-Qui est ce garçon ?
-Mon ex.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.963
Merde.

27:56.132 --> 28:00.845
Paige, I talked to my store manager
and my therapist,

28:00.929 --> 28:04.557
and I realized that
even though I hated it

28:04.641 --> 28:08.144
when you touched my stuff
and stole my sweatshirt,

28:08.228 --> 28:10.105
I hated it even more
when you were gone.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.316
-Aw.
-No "aw."

28:13.900 --> 28:19.114
And now I understand that
sometimes girls like to wear something

28:19.197 --> 28:22.117
that reminds them of their boyfriends,
even when they're not there.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.286
So I got you this necklace.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.039
Zahid's mean girlfriend got me a discount
at Claire's.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.000
Mademoiselle Hardaway!

28:55.650 --> 28:56.735
