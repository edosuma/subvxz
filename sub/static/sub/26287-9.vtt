00:17.660 --> 00:18.750
What are we doing?

00:18.750 --> 00:20.870
It's Christmastime.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.410
WOMAN:Tell me if this stings.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.330
Yeah, it stings.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.200
Good.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.290
Not expired.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.000
So, what happened?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Same as every day.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.500
Tomas and his dumbass crew
gave me crap

00:41.500 --> 00:43.660
'cause I don't know
the language yet.

00:43.660 --> 00:44.700
I just hate it here.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.450
Remember you said
the same thing in Cairo?

00:47.450 --> 00:49.500
And before that, in Athens.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.450
Ten bucks says,
by next Christmas,

00:51.450 --> 00:54.120
you and Tomas
will be best friends.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.700
Ow.
Oh, sorry.
That one's deep.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.000
Ow.
Okay, just hold still, baby.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.200
Close your eyes.

01:00.200 --> 01:00.950
If you could be

01:00.950 --> 01:04.700
anywhere in the world right now,
where would you want to be?

01:04.700 --> 01:06.750
Armenia.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.580
I liked Armenia.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.330
Okay, so...

01:09.330 --> 01:12.410
picture the mountains
above Jermuk.

01:12.410 --> 01:14.500
There's two feet
of fresh snow.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.660
You're skiing
from hot spring

01:16.660 --> 01:20.000
to hot spring.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.160
There.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.330
Done.

01:22.330 --> 01:23.500
Better?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.700
Yeah.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.700
Put on the hat.

01:26.700 --> 01:27.870
What?

01:27.870 --> 01:29.330
Every year. Why?

01:29.330 --> 01:31.700
It's a Cole family tradition.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.870
'Cause some memories

01:33.870 --> 01:36.700
are worth holding on to.

01:41.040 --> 01:41.450
Aw, you blinked.

01:41.450 --> 01:44.200
Gonna try another one.
We already did

01:44.200 --> 01:44.580
another one.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.830
Why do we have
to keep doing this?

01:46.830 --> 01:47.830
Cole family tradition.

01:47.830 --> 01:50.040
Some memories
are worth holding on to.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.330
I thought
the Cole family tradition

01:51.330 --> 01:56.040
was a phone call each Christmas
from a different war zone.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.040
Well...

01:58.040 --> 02:01.080
this is a year
of new traditions.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.200
I'm here.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.500
Your mom's engaged.

02:05.450 --> 02:07.040
You're not sorry you're...

02:07.040 --> 02:11.370
not celebrating Christmas
with Andrew's parents, are you?

02:11.370 --> 02:11.830
Are you kidding?

02:11.830 --> 02:14.250
They live on a golf course
in San Diego.

02:14.250 --> 02:17.910
That's basically, like,
a retirement community.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.910
Okay, here's the plan.

02:19.910 --> 02:20.870
We're gonna have a Christmas

02:20.870 --> 02:23.410
that makes up
for all the ones that I missed.

02:23.410 --> 02:27.080
It's gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.660
You don't have to say that.

02:28.660 --> 02:32.700
Mom told me to keep
my expectations low.

02:32.700 --> 02:33.500
So...

02:33.500 --> 02:35.700
Okay. Well, I'm doubling down.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.700
Best Christmas ever.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.080
Hey, buddy.
Cool flippers.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.120
I think Jacques Cousteau's
here to see you.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.370
Hey, Sam.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.160
Are you coming?
My dad chucked

02:51.160 --> 02:53.370
a bunch of quarters
into the deep end.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.540
Dad, can I go swimming already?

02:55.540 --> 02:56.370
Yeah, of course.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.370
After one more picture.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.540
:
Here we go.

03:03.830 --> 03:05.410
All right.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.200
I'm loving it, man.

03:12.200 --> 03:12.750
I'm there six weeks,

03:12.750 --> 03:15.660
and they already put me in
charge of tires and brake pads.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.790
It's just a matter of time
before they name you

03:17.790 --> 03:19.660

03:19.660 --> 03:22.790
OSCAR:
Yeah, my parole officer's happy

03:22.790 --> 03:23.160
about it.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.080
Sam and I will be able
to move out

03:25.080 --> 03:25.700
of this place pretty soon.

03:25.700 --> 03:29.160
Well, you got to make sure
you come say goodbye first.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.040
We're gonna miss you guys.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.200
Well, it won't be for a while.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.000
I mean, I got to save
some more money.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.910
Can't even afford to buy this
guy Christmas gifts right now.

03:37.910 --> 03:40.290

hip

Hey, this is a
guy from work.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.330
You mind keeping
an eye on Sam for me?

03:46.330 --> 03:48.540
Yeah, 'course.

04:08.450 --> 04:10.080
How are you getting
to the airport?

04:10.080 --> 04:10.830
RJ:
Uh, I think

04:10.830 --> 04:13.200
there's a bus from downtown.
Don't think.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.370
And don't take the bus.

04:14.370 --> 04:15.620
Take a cab. We'll pay for it.

04:15.620 --> 04:16.910
It's RJ. Look. It's your mother.
Hi.

04:16.910 --> 04:18.330
Yup, Dad, we can see him. Yup.
Say hi.

04:18.330 --> 04:20.080
Well, give it to me
when you're done.

04:20.080 --> 04:20.620
Yeah.
Oh, RJ,

04:20.620 --> 04:22.160
bring back Costa Rica T-shirts,
please.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.000
MURTAUGH:
Hey, did you,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.120
um, print out your
boarding pass?

04:25.120 --> 04:28.120
Yeah, yeah. I-I printed
my boarding pass. I'm good.

04:28.120 --> 04:28.830
Don't just open up the e-mail.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.040
You have to print it.
He just said he printed it.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.200
Okay, and when is
your return flight?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.000
Uh, I don't know.
I haven't booked it.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.870
Um, I was gonna do that
when I got home.

04:37.870 --> 04:38.540
Okay.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.790
That's-that's a good idea, son.

04:39.790 --> 04:43.950
All right. Love you,
and I will see you tomorrow.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.290
Did you hear that?

04:45.290 --> 04:47.660
The part where you
didn't hand me the phone?

04:47.660 --> 04:48.620
No. The return flight.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.790
He didn't make one. Maybe
he's given up on Costa Rica,

04:51.790 --> 04:54.330
and maybe
we can convince him to stay.

04:54.330 --> 04:56.750
Baby, we can't convince RJ
to do anything.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.450
It is not our job.
He is an adu...
Yes, it is.

04:59.450 --> 05:00.870
No, it's not.
It is.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.290
Roger, he's an adult.

05:02.290 --> 05:03.910
But that gives
me an idea.

05:03.910 --> 05:06.160
Hmm?
We can do a family dinner.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.120
Family dinner?
No, we got to go bigger.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.080
I'm thinking a partay.

05:10.080 --> 05:10.910
A partay?
Yes.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.370
Roger, I don't kn...
With the get down,

05:12.370 --> 05:13.910
like the kids are doing.
Oh, my gosh.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.290
No.
Uh... Wait, seriously?

05:15.290 --> 05:16.830
A partay
for coming home?

05:16.830 --> 05:19.540
I'm here all the time.
Yeah, and we'll have

05:19.540 --> 05:21.620
a party for you
when you're 35 years old

05:21.620 --> 05:24.200
and married to the guy
that we both approve.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.620
Thank you.
In the meantime,

05:25.620 --> 05:29.950
let's make this a night
that RJ remembers.

05:29.950 --> 05:31.620
Okay. Fine.

05:31.620 --> 05:32.700
Fine.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.910
A small party.

05:33.910 --> 05:34.660
Yes.
Okay?

05:34.660 --> 05:38.410
Okay. Wh... You act
like I'm gonna go overboard.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.370
:
Alan,

05:47.370 --> 05:48.950
I heard something downstairs.

05:48.950 --> 05:51.080
Probably just
the house settling.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.910
That's not a real thing.
Go look.

05:52.910 --> 05:56.000
(clattering, shattering
in distance)

05:57.700 --> 05:58.830
I'm calling 911.

05:58.830 --> 06:00.330
Screw that.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.290
Sorry, hon,

06:03.290 --> 06:06.370
you're getting
your Christmas present early.

06:06.910 --> 06:09.620
You got me a shotgun
for Christmas?

06:09.620 --> 06:12.870
You always return
the sweaters.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.120
Nobody move!

06:32.790 --> 06:35.250
Those firearm lessons
really paid off.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.330
I mean, who knew?

06:36.330 --> 06:37.700
I'm assuming you have
a permit for that thing.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.290
Yeah, she does. A permit
to splatter a guy

06:39.290 --> 06:42.080
all over our Christmas tree
and soak all the ornaments.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.290
BRENDA:
Okay, Doc, let's go.

06:43.290 --> 06:46.120
You've got teeth
to straighten.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.540
Are you okay, Roger?

06:47.540 --> 06:49.450
You're very quiet
this morning.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.330
Very banter-free.

06:51.330 --> 06:52.370
Yeah, me, I'm good.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.410
Just a little pensive.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.750
You know, thinking about things,
things like...

06:55.750 --> 06:59.450
how hard is it for you
to RSVP to a party

06:59.450 --> 07:00.950
to which you were invited?

07:00.950 --> 07:02.910
Roger, did you invite me
to a party?

07:02.910 --> 07:04.200
Yeah, don't.
It's digital,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.040
which means I know you read it.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.790
I know when you read it.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.120
Early this morning.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.870
Oh. That party.

07:10.870 --> 07:12.700
Yeah, that party.
Yeah.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.450
Yeah, I can't make that.

07:13.450 --> 07:16.540
It's my first holiday
season with Maya.

07:16.540 --> 07:17.160
So bring her.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.950
There's a space
on the RSVP for guests.

07:19.950 --> 07:21.410
Just that one click,

07:21.410 --> 07:23.750
and I get that satisfying ding.

07:23.750 --> 07:26.370
Like that.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.580
Scorsese.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.580
Plus four?!

07:30.580 --> 07:31.540
W... I don't know exactly

07:31.540 --> 07:33.500
who they're gonna be yet.
Is that too many?

07:33.500 --> 07:35.700
You didn't cap off
the invite list.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.540
Do you mind if I...

07:37.540 --> 07:39.160
It is my favorite part, but...

07:39.160 --> 07:41.540
yeah.

07:44.910 --> 07:46.200
What is it?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.700
I'm giving you your RSVP.

07:47.700 --> 07:52.370
I'm not gonna be able to make it
to that party, Roger.

AVERY:Three home invasions
in the last month,

07:59.250 --> 08:01.910
and you got him.
How is this not open

08:01.910 --> 08:03.750
You have your dead perp,
Lewis Fowler,

08:03.750 --> 08:04.870
and you know
who his partner is.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.660
Actually, we don't.
There's a lot of nuances here.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.870
Wait, you saw your dead home
invader conspiring yesterday

08:09.870 --> 08:11.200
at your hotel with an ex-con.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.040
"Conspiring"
is a loaded term.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.200
Oscar's a good man.

08:14.200 --> 08:14.620
He is an ex-con

08:14.620 --> 08:17.540
who literally did time
for breaking and entering.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.080
I know the guy.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.660
Our kids are friends.
He's turned his life around.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.700
Huh. And what does
your partner think?

08:22.700 --> 08:23.200
He thinks he did it.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.290
But, between us, Roger's
a little preoccupied

08:26.290 --> 08:28.040
with this party he's throwing.

08:28.040 --> 08:28.870
What party?

08:28.870 --> 08:30.080
He didn't invite me.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.750
Well, that's because
you and Todd go

08:31.750 --> 08:32.450
to Wyoming every Christmas

08:32.450 --> 08:35.000
to see his parents.
I'm sorry, is this Wyoming?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.750
Are we in Wyoming right now?

08:38.450 --> 08:39.160
No.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.330
It's not Wyoming.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.660
Are you okay, Captain?

08:41.660 --> 08:43.700
Everything good
with you and Todd?

08:43.700 --> 08:45.750
And now I'm being interrogated
about the status

08:45.750 --> 08:47.540
of my relationship
on Christmas Eve?

08:47.540 --> 08:48.750
That's perfect.

08:48.750 --> 08:49.120
Okay.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.160
So we'll, uh, just go
to the motel and talk to Oscar.

08:53.160 --> 08:53.290
Great.

08:53.290 --> 08:55.620
I'll let Roger know
you're in town for the holidays.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.040
Awesome.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.950
Okay.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.540
Ah, Detectives.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.620
It's a pre-Christmas miracle.

09:09.620 --> 09:13.750
Let me guess-- you guys heard
about my holiday cookies.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.370
We need to borrow your slab.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.160
What do we got?

09:17.160 --> 09:17.830
Chopped-up
body parts.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.910
A jogger found them
in Griffith Park.

09:19.910 --> 09:21.370
It's the holidays,
so, of course,

09:21.370 --> 09:22.910
Murtaugh and Cole catch
a simple case,

09:22.910 --> 09:24.910
and we get to spend
the day putting together

09:24.910 --> 09:25.700
some random guy's bits.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.160
The patriarchy strikes again.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.540
I think we got
the better gig.

09:29.540 --> 09:32.250
Come on, guys, we get
to make a puzzle

09:32.250 --> 09:34.040
out of body parts.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.620
You're kind of a weirdo,

09:36.620 --> 09:37.200
aren't you?

09:37.200 --> 09:40.120
Hey, you're both going
to Murtaugh's, right?

09:40.120 --> 09:42.450
Any interest
in a little pre

09:42.450 --> 09:45.500
I know this spicy,
spicy kombucha joint.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.620
Zero interest.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.660
I'm in.

09:47.660 --> 09:48.200
Cool.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.870
All right.
I'll text you the details.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.580
Ran out of gloves.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.120
Be right back.

09:56.540 --> 09:59.080
Just so you know, you don't
have to be polite to Scorsese.

09:59.080 --> 10:03.290
You'll want to, you know, shut
him down earlier in the day,

10:03.290 --> 10:04.330
before he gets his hopes up.

10:04.330 --> 10:06.410
Oh, I wasn't
gonna shut him down.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.580
I love kombucha.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.830
Everybody does.

10:10.830 --> 10:12.120
But it's Scorsese.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.040
So...

10:13.040 --> 10:14.410
Dude seems interesting.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.410
I keep forgetting
that you're new.

10:16.410 --> 10:18.870
Some people have
to learn the hard way.

10:18.870 --> 10:22.250
I like the hard way.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.080
MANAGER:Listen, the only reason

10:24.080 --> 10:26.450
I'm letting you guys in here
is 'cause of my respect

10:26.450 --> 10:28.080
and affection
for your partner.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.120
Also, we have
a warrant.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.080
Well, yeah,
you have that, too,

10:30.080 --> 10:31.200
but a lot of it's
'cause of the respect
Yeah.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.040
and affection
for your partner.
For the-for the partner. Yeah.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.290
Yeah.
Open the door.

10:35.290 --> 10:36.870
Okay. Yeah, yeah,
I can do that.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.290
I've got a magnetic personality.

10:38.290 --> 10:41.160
The Howard Hughes of this place.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.500
I am.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.000
Why don't you and the president

10:44.000 --> 10:45.200
of your fan club get started.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.410
I got to take this.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.040
Hey, baby.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.290
How you doing?
Roger,

10:50.290 --> 10:54.870
remember when you said we were
keeping RJ's party small?

10:54.870 --> 10:56.410
Now...

10:56.410 --> 10:58.500
did you order
an ice sculpture?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.950
:
Of course I didn't.

11:00.950 --> 11:02.000
Now, did I

11:02.000 --> 11:03.950
make a call and get a quote

11:03.950 --> 11:07.700
from a guy
for a ice sculpture? Uh...

11:07.700 --> 11:08.660
Ah... maybe.

11:08.660 --> 11:11.450
Roger, if you called just to get
a quote, why is the guy here?

11:11.450 --> 11:13.830
With a block of ice
and a chisel.

11:13.830 --> 11:15.620
And two DJs, Roger. Really?

11:15.620 --> 11:16.950
Two DJs?!

11:16.950 --> 11:18.200
I don't hear you.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.660
Baby, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

11:20.660 --> 11:21.040
Oscar Ripley?

11:21.040 --> 11:23.870
LAPD. We need to ta...

11:23.870 --> 11:25.540
Oh...

11:38.790 --> 11:41.200
Dad?
He's not gonna stop.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.330
Roger, don't shoot!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.870
Oscar, hit the brakes!

11:52.830 --> 11:54.750
MAYA:
Dad, your room.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.250
Don't worry, sweetie.
It's just a little mess,

11:57.250 --> 11:58.540
we'll clean it all up.
Get your hands

11:58.540 --> 12:02.790
behind your back.
Still gonna be the
best Christmas ever.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.200
Dad?

12:14.330 --> 12:15.620
It's not just the room.

12:16.620 --> 12:19.450
It's what was
in the room.

12:19.450 --> 12:21.000
Tree, decorations.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.870
I had these little
cute dancing elves.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.870
You just wind 'em up,
and they're...

12:28.160 --> 12:30.040
Not a single one survived.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.660
Look, I-I'm sorry, man.

12:31.660 --> 12:34.120
I truly am.
I panicked.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.160
Not a good look
on an innocent man.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.200
I heard about the burglary,
all right,

12:38.200 --> 12:40.080
and I knew
you saw me talking to Lewis.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.830
I was worried that you would
think I was involved.

12:44.620 --> 12:45.700
Guess what I think now.

12:45.700 --> 12:49.580
Lewis offered me the
job, but I said no.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.410
I got Sam to look after now.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.830
Speaking of which...

12:54.830 --> 12:55.500
Found this in your room.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.750
Stolen from a home invasion
last week.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.660
Oh, see, I bought that
off of Lewis.

13:01.660 --> 13:04.200
I'm just trying
to give Sam a great Christmas,

13:04.200 --> 13:08.200
especially since I've
missed so many already.

13:08.410 --> 13:10.620
I'm not the guy
you're looking for, Wes.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.790
Would you please tell Cole
that this is exactly the guy

13:13.790 --> 13:17.120
that we're looking for,
and we want to go home?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.500
Not me. I never
want to go home again.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.580
Okay, Mr. Dark and Stormy,
what's going on?

13:21.580 --> 13:24.330
Cole told me that you and Todd
cancelled your trip.
Not cancelled.

13:24.330 --> 13:28.790
Todd's in Wyoming. You know, I
don't want to talk about it.
Perfect, because I don't like...

13:28.790 --> 13:29.910
I mean, if he wants
to be apart

13:29.910 --> 13:30.830
for the holidays,
we'll be apart.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.200
Solo. Some people
find that peaceful.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.660
They do. And that's
the right attitude. Relax.

13:36.660 --> 13:40.500
All alone in a big, quiet,
empty house, room

13:40.500 --> 13:41.660
after room of...

13:41.660 --> 13:44.620
Okay, look, hey,
you want to come over early

13:44.620 --> 13:46.660
and help me prep
for RJ's party?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.370
Oh, God, please, yes.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.700
Okay, yeah.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.120
Can you let me go, man?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.370
Like, just
I promised Sam

13:53.370 --> 13:56.500
that I-I'd take him
to the parade tomorrow

13:56.500 --> 13:58.500
to meet Santa.

14:01.410 --> 14:02.000
I can't.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.790
Everything's pointing
to you right now.

14:04.790 --> 14:07.160
Yeah.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.950
Then can you do this?

14:10.950 --> 14:14.620
Don't let Sam
go to some foster family,

14:14.620 --> 14:17.870
not for Christmas, man.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.160
♪ Hark! the herald... ♪

14:22.160 --> 14:24.950
Why can't you get him out?
Dad, you know him.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.950
He's innocent.
My dad promised.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.000
He doesn't do the stuff
he did before.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.500
I believe him. It's just not
enough to get him out of jail.
Okay, well,

14:32.500 --> 14:33.410
what would be enough?

14:33.410 --> 14:34.370
Well, we'd have
to find the burglar

14:34.370 --> 14:36.330
whowasat the scene
to prove it wasn't

14:36.330 --> 14:38.790
Sam's dad, but that's
a long shot.

14:39.700 --> 14:40.950
What about him?

14:40.950 --> 14:44.370
He's the guy in the car
with my dad's friend yesterday.

14:44.370 --> 14:45.790
While you were swimming?

14:45.790 --> 14:47.450
There was somebody else
in the car with Lewis?

14:47.450 --> 14:50.160
Yeah. We saw him whenwe
went in to grab snacks.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.950
That looks a lot
like Santa, buddy.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.450
It's not Santa, Dad.

14:54.450 --> 14:55.370
We're 12.

14:55.370 --> 14:56.910
You left out
the birthmark.

14:56.910 --> 14:58.540
White beard, red cheeks

14:58.540 --> 15:00.750
and a peanut-shaped
birthmark.

15:00.750 --> 15:03.330
Like this.
Yeah. Just like that.

15:03.330 --> 15:07.250
You said this was gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

15:07.250 --> 15:11.750
Well, I don't want a tree
or wind-up dancing elves.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.500
Find him.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.660
Get Sam's dad out.

All right,
just tell me.

15:30.540 --> 15:31.950
I can tell
something's wrong.

15:31.950 --> 15:33.750
Ever since
I lost the election,

15:33.750 --> 15:36.500
Todd's disappointment
has been palpable.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.750
That does not sound like Todd.
You'd be surprised.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.950
Hey, hey, we're at party
in minus 50 minutes, people.

15:41.950 --> 15:43.540
Can I get some help here?

15:43.540 --> 15:45.950
Okay, Roger, Brooks
is in a crisis.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.700
He needs someone to
listen to him right now.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.410
Well, can we listen
while he dices onions?

15:50.410 --> 15:53.040
It'll help mask his tears.

15:53.040 --> 15:53.950
Roger!

15:53.950 --> 15:55.620
That's probably the photo booth.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.250
He... By the way,
he left early today to do this.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.000
TRISH:
He did.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Ah. I had you down for
a "will not attend."

16:04.000 --> 16:06.250
Plus zero, by the way.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.160
Change of plans. Do you mind

16:07.160 --> 16:09.330
if these guys
hang out here for a bit?

16:09.330 --> 16:10.160
Uh, Murtaugh,

16:10.160 --> 16:12.000
this is my best
friend Sam.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.040
Hey, Sam.
Do you dice vegetables?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.660
TRISH:
Honey. What?

16:15.660 --> 16:16.330
I'm serious.

16:16.330 --> 16:18.120
Maya, come on.
Bring your friend in.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.910
Come on.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.410
Thanks for helping my dad.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.160
You got it.

16:24.540 --> 16:27.950
Hey, Oscar's kid--
what did he mean?

16:27.950 --> 16:29.410
He gave us a lead. Let's go.

16:29.410 --> 16:32.120
I can't. I got a party.
I can't just go.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.580
No problem. Why don't
you tell his kid, then?

16:34.580 --> 16:35.790
I'm sure he'll understand.

16:35.790 --> 16:39.620
All right. What's the lead?

16:40.330 --> 16:42.160
That's not a lead.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.200
That's a kid killing time
between French fries.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.330
It's exactly what I thought

16:46.330 --> 16:48.620
until I scoured about a
half-dozen mug books,

16:48.620 --> 16:51.120
and I found this.
Calvin Marks.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.330
Armed robbery, assault,

16:53.330 --> 16:54.000
home invasion.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.160
Plus, he shared a halfway
house with our DOA, Lewis.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.950
Look at the birthmark.

16:58.950 --> 17:01.200
Yeah.

17:01.450 --> 17:05.540
Okay, we got to be back here
by 8:00, all right?
Okay.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.370
And I drive.
Let's go.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.790
This is the last
known address.

17:15.790 --> 17:18.660
Looks like nobody's
been here in forever.

17:18.660 --> 17:21.370
Well, this thing
is bolted shut.

17:21.370 --> 17:23.910
No one's getting
through that door tonight.

17:23.910 --> 17:24.790
I have a pitch.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.290
We come back tomorrow
with some warrants

17:27.290 --> 17:30.040
and heavy machinery.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.000
Hey, Tarzan, where you going?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.790
Looking for another way in.

17:38.290 --> 17:43.620
Hey, Roger,
do you believe in miracles?

17:43.620 --> 17:45.000
Come on.
You've never heard of...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.540
A fictional character. Get...

17:46.540 --> 17:49.160
See you downstairs.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.290
Come on down, Rog.

17:57.290 --> 17:58.500
Piece of cake.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.910
Roger, what's happening?

18:11.160 --> 18:12.580
Piece of cake?

18:12.580 --> 18:13.750
I'm stuck.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.910
Get me out of here.

18:14.910 --> 18:17.620
All right, all right,
settle down.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.080
Come on!

18:19.080 --> 18:19.410
Come on.

18:19.410 --> 18:22.040
Maybe a piece of cake
was the problem.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.410
All right, you stay right here.

18:24.410 --> 18:25.160
I'll be right back, buddy.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.370
I'm gonna get some, uh, cooking
spray or something slippery

18:28.370 --> 18:29.330
to get you out of there.

18:29.330 --> 18:32.660
Where you going?!
Don't leave me here!

18:46.000 --> 18:49.160
Hey, Roger!

19:01.500 --> 19:03.200
Oh, boy.

19:29.910 --> 19:32.290
Oh! Cole!

19:47.580 --> 19:48.950
Huh.

19:48.950 --> 19:50.160
Cole,

19:50.160 --> 19:52.870
where did they go?!

19:52.870 --> 19:54.410
In a surprising turn of events,

19:54.410 --> 19:56.580
it looks like
the front door opens after all.

19:56.580 --> 20:01.830
You know you're not invited
to my party, right?

20:01.830 --> 20:03.870
Roger.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.590
COLE:We call the arraignment judge

20:08.590 --> 20:09.800
at home and tell him
to spring Oscar

20:09.800 --> 20:11.250
because we have
two better suspects.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.380
Except we don't, do we?

20:12.380 --> 20:14.250
No, I mean, technically,
we don't have them.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.340
Technically, that's
what we need.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.460
You have no... you have no
perps, you have no evidence.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.300
We have a thumb.
A human thumb.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.130
Right. The, uh,
missing digit,

20:22.130 --> 20:25.090
which, even if you did have it,
would prove what, again?

20:25.090 --> 20:26.050
I don't know.

20:26.050 --> 20:29.000
But the wrong guy's in jail,
Captain. I'm sure of it.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.090
You're probably right.

20:30.090 --> 20:31.800
But without suspects
or evidence,

20:31.800 --> 20:34.250
there is no way
he's getting released.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.630
I'm sorry, Cole.
Merry Christmas.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.460
We're gonna get him out.

20:42.460 --> 20:43.710
But not tonight.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.090
I did everything I could.

20:45.090 --> 20:45.590
Well, it wasn't enough.

20:45.590 --> 20:48.710
I promised Sam you would
get his Dad out by tomorrow.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.340
Honey, why would
you promise him that?

20:50.340 --> 20:51.250
Because I know what it's like

20:51.250 --> 20:53.250
to not have your dad there
for Christmas.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.920
I've done it my entire life,

20:54.920 --> 20:56.670
and it sucks.

20:56.670 --> 20:58.050
Maya.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.380
Let her go.

21:00.380 --> 21:01.340
This'll pass.

21:01.340 --> 21:04.460
I don't even have a place
for her to sleep tonight.

21:04.460 --> 21:05.880
Cole, come on.
You both will stay here.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.550
You go back to the motel,
get some of your stuff.

21:08.550 --> 21:11.670
She knows
you're doing your best.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.630
Maybe.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.380
Deep down, I know she's right.

21:17.380 --> 21:20.500
It's not enough.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.670
♪ ♪

21:28.130 --> 21:29.250
How's your body?

21:29.250 --> 21:30.630
The one in the morgue.

21:30.630 --> 21:32.710
The one you're...
piecing together.

21:32.710 --> 21:33.420
Has...

21:33.420 --> 21:37.210
Uh, well, we're up to the waist,
so we know it's a male.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.750
We should have all the DNA
by tomorrow.

21:40.750 --> 21:41.050
Mm. Mm. Mm.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.300
But, Cap, what do you think
about this?

21:43.300 --> 21:44.800
The Gute and Scorsese--
she says

21:44.800 --> 21:47.000
she's having fun
with him tonight.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.750
Fun. With Scorsese.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.750
It's easy
to misunderstand people.

21:50.750 --> 21:53.550
Wait, what am I
misunderstanding?

21:53.550 --> 21:54.920
We're flawed.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.170
We make mistakes,

21:56.170 --> 21:57.670
we push away
the people we love.

21:57.670 --> 22:00.880
We're not talking
about Scorsese anymore, are we?

22:00.880 --> 22:03.050
Todd wasn't disappointed in me.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.880
:
I was disappointed in myself.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.050
I think I've become
difficult to live with.

22:08.050 --> 22:11.090
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna get you some coffee.

22:11.090 --> 22:12.840
That's probably a good idea.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.670
Hey.
Hey.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.590
Uh, Dad, listen...
You landed!

22:19.590 --> 22:21.250
Huh? Well, listen,
you're a little late,

22:21.250 --> 22:24.130
but you'll make up some time
on the freeway, right?

22:24.130 --> 22:27.170
No, no, I'm-I'm still
in, uh, Costa Rica.

22:27.170 --> 22:28.630
Say what

22:28.630 --> 22:29.590
Yeah, my-my, uh,

22:29.590 --> 22:31.840
airline ticket got,
uh, messed up.

22:31.840 --> 22:32.960
Just a technical glitch.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.210
A glitch?
What kind of glitch?

22:35.210 --> 22:36.550
Um, well, they had me...

22:36.550 --> 22:39.000
on a flight for yesterday
and-and not today,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.500
on account of the time zones.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.840
Time zones? It's a
one-hour difference.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.500
That's not technical.

22:44.500 --> 22:49.460
It sounds like a humanglitch,
one very specific human.

22:49.460 --> 22:50.050
It's RJ.

22:50.050 --> 22:52.590
Fool missed his flight.
This is so typical

22:52.590 --> 22:55.090
of him.
Dad, I'm still on the phone.

22:55.090 --> 22:57.550
Well, listen, it'll...
honey, it'll be fine.

22:57.550 --> 22:58.800
When's the next flight out?

22:58.800 --> 23:01.960
Maybe tomorrow, end of the week.

23:01.960 --> 23:02.420
Um...

23:02.420 --> 23:04.380
I'm not sure--
you know, flights are spotty.

23:04.380 --> 23:07.340
Sp... You know what's spotty?
You're spotty!

23:07.340 --> 23:07.840
And flaky!

23:07.840 --> 23:09.500
That's the perfect country
for you.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.170
Okay, i-it happens,
and you are not helping.

23:12.170 --> 23:14.840
Yeah, it happens to
thiskid, all the time.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.800
We got 40people downstairs.
What are we supposed

23:17.800 --> 23:20.670
to tell them, you can't make it
to your own party?

23:20.670 --> 23:23.670
A party

23:23.670 --> 23:24.420
This is ridiculous.

23:24.420 --> 23:27.090
Do I have to come down there
and fly you back myself?

23:27.090 --> 23:30.210
Wha...? I didn't call you
to get yelled at.

23:30.210 --> 23:31.340
Okay, give me the phone.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.920
RJ, honey, why don't
you look into...

23:33.920 --> 23:34.380
You know what?

23:34.380 --> 23:38.460
New rule: you can't go
to another foreign country

23:38.460 --> 23:40.340
until you can read the clock.

23:40.340 --> 23:41.750
Roger, stop it.

23:41.750 --> 23:42.420
I'm serious.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.380
Look, if this is
how you're gonna be,

23:44.380 --> 23:46.250
maybe I shouldn't
come back at all.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.460
Oh. Well, it's a moot point now,
isn't it?

23:48.460 --> 23:50.880
Because even if
you wanted to,

23:50.880 --> 23:53.460
your flight left yesterday!

23:56.800 --> 23:59.210
Hmm! Can you
believe that?

23:59.210 --> 24:00.210
He hung up on me.

24:00.210 --> 24:04.050
Oh. I can't believe
it took him that long.

24:04.050 --> 24:06.840
You act like, somehow,
this is my fault.

24:06.840 --> 24:10.250
Oh, there is
nosomehowabout it.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.710
Why do you
always do that?

24:12.710 --> 24:14.960
:
Why... do what?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.250
Try to control him.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.380
Give him no margin
for error.

24:18.380 --> 24:19.250
RJ is an adult.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.460
Well, then he needs
to act like one.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.800
Hmm.
He forgets

24:22.800 --> 24:23.840
to register his passport,

24:23.840 --> 24:26.130
then he books the wrong
flight coming back home,

24:26.130 --> 24:29.920
and now, to top it all off,
he's missing his party.

24:29.920 --> 24:33.210
Hisparty?
Hisparty.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.210
Hmm.

24:34.210 --> 24:36.420
This is your party.

24:38.380 --> 24:42.250
I wanted a nice
dinner with our son.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.750
But I got

24:43.750 --> 24:45.250
an ice sculpture

24:45.250 --> 24:48.800
and12 gallons of gazpacho.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.550
They had a sale.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.880
And why are you acting like

24:52.880 --> 24:53.630
it's my fault that

24:53.630 --> 24:54.920
he missed his...
Missed...

24:54.920 --> 24:57.300
his flight, Roger.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.550
That's all.

24:58.550 --> 25:01.340
You have got to find
a new gear for him.

25:01.340 --> 25:06.050
Because if you keep giving RJ
reasons not to come home...

25:06.050 --> 25:09.090
he won't come home.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.460
YOUNG COLE:Come on, we're gonna be late.

25:38.460 --> 25:41.920
Tomas said we decorate
the tree before dinner.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.380
I'm excited, too.

25:43.380 --> 25:45.880
I-I'll see you tomorrow.

25:47.550 --> 25:50.880
We're leaving again, aren't we?

25:52.300 --> 25:53.130
Indonesia.

25:53.130 --> 25:58.170
They've asked me to cover
a separatist uprising.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.840
This is good news.

25:59.840 --> 26:03.170
We're gonna be living
on the beach.

26:03.170 --> 26:03.670
When are we going?

26:03.670 --> 26:06.000
They want me there
Christmas morning,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
so, um...

26:07.000 --> 26:09.250
we leave tonight.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.210
Hey. We're gonna be
surfing at sunrise.

26:14.210 --> 26:15.090
I don't care.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.800
We're supposed to have Christmas
with Tomas's family.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.340
I don't want to wake up
somewhere new.

26:20.340 --> 26:21.840
So... you'll make
new friends.

26:21.840 --> 26:25.250
You know how long it took me
to make thesefriends?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.090
I don't want
to start over.

26:27.090 --> 26:29.710
I know that this
is disappointing,

26:29.710 --> 26:32.840
but you have to see
the bigger picture.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.880
We have never seen Indonesia,

26:34.880 --> 26:37.250
and it is gonna be awesome.

26:37.250 --> 26:38.880
I promise.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.000
What do I always tell you, huh?

26:41.000 --> 26:44.050
Another adventure awaits.

26:48.380 --> 26:49.000
Dude.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.460
I went to the mat
for you, man, but...

26:51.460 --> 26:53.880
owner's real mad
about the whole...

26:53.880 --> 26:55.880
car-in-the-hotel thing.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.210
He wants you out.

26:57.210 --> 26:59.210
He called you a chaos magnet.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.840
Yeah. I get that.

27:00.840 --> 27:01.170
I don't.

27:01.170 --> 27:03.920
Youdidn't drive your car
into the wall.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.590
You're the
victim here.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.960
Super badass victim.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.210
I mean...

27:09.210 --> 27:10.960
no room at the inn?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.670
On Christmas Eve?

27:12.670 --> 27:14.750
What have we become?

27:14.750 --> 27:16.170
Gus...

27:16.170 --> 27:18.670
don't worry, I'll be fine.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.210
Yeah, but...

27:20.210 --> 27:21.960
where are you gonna go?

27:21.960 --> 27:25.340
Another adventure awaits.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.750
ROGER JR.:
Hey. It's RJ's phone. Say
what's up and I'll hit you back.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.210
Hey-hey!
RJ, listen, um...

27:37.210 --> 27:40.500
I know I got a little
carried away last night.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.920
May have scared you off
coming home.

27:42.920 --> 27:43.340
I hope not.

27:43.340 --> 27:47.670
I mean, you know, people book
the wrong flights all the time.

27:47.670 --> 27:49.460
I'm sure it's a common mistake.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.380
I just personally don't know
anybody that is dumb enough

27:52.380 --> 27:55.250
to do something...
Wait, that's not what I meant.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.210
Murtaugh, you got a second?

27:57.210 --> 27:59.710
Yeah. How do you
delete a voice mail

27:59.710 --> 28:00.800
that you sent to somebody?

28:00.800 --> 28:03.840
You go to Costa Rica
and steal RJ's phone.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.630
Come on.

28:04.630 --> 28:06.800
You need to see this.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.380
Geez.

28:09.380 --> 28:12.880
Looks like a Manson family
jigsaw puzzle.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.670
Exactly. You see,
this guy gets it.

28:14.670 --> 28:16.170
No, do you notice
anything missing?

28:16.170 --> 28:18.960
Here's a hint: the day you
got stuck in a chimney.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.340
I didn't get stuck.

28:20.340 --> 28:21.920
I was descending slowly.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.630
It was a gentleman's entry.
Yeah, well,

28:23.630 --> 28:27.880
we all heard what Cole said
he found in a freezer.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.840
His left thumb?

28:30.380 --> 28:32.840
Okay, so, who is this guy?

28:32.840 --> 28:36.170
No. No, no, no, no.
Get up. Up.

28:36.170 --> 28:36.800
I don't even like people

28:36.800 --> 28:39.840
sittingon my couch for
extended periods of time.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.590
Sorry, Captain.

28:40.590 --> 28:42.880
I was up late working
on the Oscar case.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.550
What are you doing here?

28:44.550 --> 28:45.710
It's Christmas.
No, it's not.

28:45.710 --> 28:47.670
Out there,
it's Christmas.

28:47.670 --> 28:49.590
But in here, it's
just another day.

28:49.590 --> 28:51.960
Where is that holiday spirit?
It's in Wyoming.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.960
Well, I have something
that might cheer you up.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.710
I had a little
breakthrough last night.

28:55.710 --> 28:57.300
Look at this.
The home invasion file?

28:57.300 --> 28:59.550
I read it. It's three
random victims.

28:59.550 --> 29:00.710
An orthodontist,
a night janitor

29:00.710 --> 29:02.710
and a commercial real estate
agent-- no connection.

29:02.710 --> 29:05.710
Wrong. All three of them
used the same parking garage

29:05.710 --> 29:07.340
on Prospect Street.
Boom. Breakthrough.

29:07.340 --> 29:10.460
Barely. That's probably where
the crew found their victims.

29:10.460 --> 29:13.460
Let the garage management know
and go find another couch.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.710
I feel like there's more
to it than that.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.500
There's some kind of design
with these robberies.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.050
I just can't put
my finger on it.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.920
'Cause it's not
any finger.

29:20.920 --> 29:21.380
It's your thumb.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.550
The body me and Gute
just put together.
It's missing a left thumb?

29:24.550 --> 29:26.090
Right.
Well, then it
can't be the same.

29:26.090 --> 29:29.210
No, it is the left thumb.
I'm saying he's right.

29:29.210 --> 29:29.670
But he...

29:29.670 --> 29:30.750
What are we doing?
Okay, well,

29:30.750 --> 29:32.340
who
W

29:32.340 --> 29:34.840
It's...is
Dan Underwood.

29:34.840 --> 29:38.500
He managed the Global Initiative
Currency Exchange on...
Prospect Street.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.380

42:56.290 --> 42:58.080
Yeah, that sounds kind of messy.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.790
It is messy, but it's family.

43:00.790 --> 43:04.500
And I wouldn't have it
any other way.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.460
Thank you.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.460
Perfect.
So, let's eat!
