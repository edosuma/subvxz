WEBVTT

00:18.518 --> 00:20.186
You were right, Cano.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.022
Chapo is a traitor.

00:26.443 --> 00:30.780
If he betrayed someone like you
who has risked his neck for him,

00:30.864 --> 00:33.533
sooner than later,
he's going to fuck all of us.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.203
As long as he's alive, peace won't last.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.665
You've already shown
that you can handle him,

00:40.749 --> 00:43.001
and I can give you loyal men
like La MuÃ±eca,

00:44.127 --> 00:46.713
and can also give what you need
to defeat them...

00:47.881 --> 00:48.798
Information.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.093
There is no worse enemy than an ex-friend.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.055
El Chapo owes me a few.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.516
I'm in.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.272
Then let's do this.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.401
The federal government
is going to take it out on us.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.362
We have to attack and defend ourselves
at the same time.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.158
Look, Arturo, Chente and I
can defend the territories

01:15.241 --> 01:16.534
of Ciudad Juarez and Nuevo Laredo,

01:17.327 --> 01:19.537
but you're going to take care
of the icing on the cake:

01:21.331 --> 01:22.665
attack El Chapo at his house.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.418
Culiacan.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.253
Fucking great!

01:29.589 --> 01:30.924
Well, gentlemen,

01:32.258 --> 01:34.844
now he definitely won't have a chance
against the three of us.

01:36.763 --> 01:37.722
Chente.

02:01.913 --> 02:05.875
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>From my boiling blood</i>

02:06.459 --> 02:10.588
<i>I feel the fear, sweat dripping away</i>

02:10.713 --> 02:14.676
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>That nothing transmits</i>

02:15.176 --> 02:21.349
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

02:21.683 --> 02:24.811
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:29.607
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

02:30.191 --> 02:33.736
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

02:34.737 --> 02:38.867
<i>To unleash my return</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:47.500
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

02:47.667 --> 02:51.796
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

02:52.297 --> 02:56.259
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

02:56.634 --> 03:02.682
<i>There are silhouettes that</i>
<i>Come to meet me</i>

03:03.099 --> 03:07.353
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

03:07.562 --> 03:10.523
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

03:11.441 --> 03:15.111
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

03:16.195 --> 03:20.074
<i>To unleash my return</i>

03:25.955 --> 03:28.708
EL CIELO RANCH

03:30.376 --> 03:32.128
"Here there's nothing to be afraid of."

03:32.503 --> 03:34.255
As if I couldn't take
care of myself on my own!

03:36.007 --> 03:38.426
I've been asking you the whole way
and you don't tell me anything.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.970
They're going to make me stay here anyway
until they get tired of me?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.222
Well, stop complaining!

03:42.513 --> 03:44.974
This is your fault and no one else's.
Your irresponsibility.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.353
I can get my shit together.
I don't need anyone hiding me.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.980
These are your father's orders!
So deal with it!

03:53.858 --> 03:56.319
Quinito.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.995
How serious is the situation?

04:06.287 --> 04:07.789
You know how Joaquin is.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.457
He's just being cautious.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.961
Don't try to fool me. Be straightforward
and tell me what's going on.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.092
Quino's release from jail
complicated things.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.678
Joaquin doesn't want to take risks,

04:21.970 --> 04:25.056
specially with him,
the one who started all this mess.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.226
I agree with my son.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.353
We must be careful.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.108
I've got something important to do.
I can't stay locked here.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.652
If your dad orders us to do this,
he must have a good reason.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.989
I get Quino's issue, but I have
nothing to do with it.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.532
Son, this isn't a game.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.910
You've done enough
with getting out of your house.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.162
The order is for all of us,
and we all have extra security

04:48.246 --> 04:50.081
while your dad is solving the problem.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.960
Thanks for the sandwich, Mom.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.795
Don't worry.

05:17.900 --> 05:21.487
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA'S HOUSE

05:25.992 --> 05:28.369
We've turned every stone
just looking for him.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.372
Arturo has become our worst enemy.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.666
He's formed an alliance
with El Cano and El Chente.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.464
-He broke peace.
-No, Joaquin.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.426
You're the one who broke peace
by giving Arriero to them.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.346
They got my son arrested.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.142
The last time someone in my family
was arrested, he got killed.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.144
I had to get him out.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.357
You promised us peace and profit
if we joined your Federation...

05:59.817 --> 06:01.319
and it has been the opposite.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.988
A new war is about to start,

06:05.531 --> 06:07.575
not only against El Chente and El Cano,

06:07.950 --> 06:10.661
against Arturo, too.
A man who knows all of our moves.

06:13.164 --> 06:16.793
Enough blood and death has resulted
with you at the head of the Federation.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.549
I'm not in this war anymore.
I'm not taking sides.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.304
I quit your Federation.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.024
We quit your Federation, too.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.611
This is getting out of hand, Joaquin.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.677
Any news?

07:11.222 --> 07:13.349
It's like he fell off
the face of the earth.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.395
We've already looked
at all the safe houses,

07:18.146 --> 07:20.356
we have men all over town,
but not a trace of him.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.899
Get more men to look for him.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.364
Are we going to resume attacks against
Nuevo Laredo and Juarez?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.323
Yes.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.743
Those territories have to be ours.
We must weaken them.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.288
Those three together
can beat the hell out of us.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.129
What the fuck are you doing here?

07:43.796 --> 07:45.214
We agreed you wouldn't come!

07:46.048 --> 07:47.884
I came to ask your permission
to go to the gathering.

07:48.009 --> 07:48.885
No!

07:50.094 --> 07:51.888
Dad, I'm ready to do my first job.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.181
You'll do it later.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.223
I can't.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.852
I'm already meeting the gringos, and you
told me I have to comply with them.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.896
I will not fail them in my first job.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.277
Fucking kid!

08:06.402 --> 08:07.737
Come on, don't be like that.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.989
The gathering isn't that risky.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.074
I'll be safer there
than in Culiacan, right?

08:13.826 --> 08:16.662
OK, then.
But I'm going to give you a double escort.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.998
Come here. Good luck!

08:35.306 --> 08:36.807
And what makes you so tense?

08:37.683 --> 08:41.312
Work stuff...
A peace that didn't last at all.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.232
And a war for which I'll have to answer

08:44.315 --> 08:46.150
all my career, if it's not resolved.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.660
Does your rate still include
listening to me? Or is that extra?

08:58.329 --> 08:59.247
Come.

09:01.582 --> 09:02.500
Come!

09:16.597 --> 09:19.141
I charge you what I want...

09:21.102 --> 09:23.521
and what I want is free.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.439
Do you understand?

09:28.609 --> 09:29.485
Do you understand?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.781
If you want me to listen to you,
I charge you in another way.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.644
Relax, we're just friends having dinner.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.153
If you don't relax,
then it's going to be suspicious.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.326
I don't think this was a good idea.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.829
Smile!

10:29.378 --> 10:32.006
I didn't mention it,
but today on my way home,

10:32.089 --> 10:34.050
an asshole crashed into my taxi.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.344
We turned and...

10:38.596 --> 10:39.764
he crashed into us.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.392
Luckily it wasn't that bad.
The guy didn't even get out

10:43.476 --> 10:45.269
to see how his car was. He just took off.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.360
Why don't we order something to take out?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.780
Lets order a pizza and leave?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.241
A pizza sounds good.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.371
Excuse me!

11:04.705 --> 11:07.291
May I have a pizza to go, please?

11:07.375 --> 11:10.211
Your choice. And the bill.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.050
MACHO PRIETO SECURITY HOUSE
VILLA DEL SOL NEIGHBORHOOD

11:19.345 --> 11:22.556
Uh, uh, uh uh...

11:23.349 --> 11:26.185
Ah! I'm going to fuck you all!

11:26.268 --> 11:27.770
Give it your all, Metrico.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.439
Metrico! Metrico! Metrico!

11:35.694 --> 11:38.030
Metrico! Metrico! Metrico!

11:48.582 --> 11:51.168
You've got to start the hunt
for Arturo Bernal Leyda.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.337
Get ready!

14:27.783 --> 14:28.784
Hey.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.956
I'm fucking hungry.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.055
There's a lot of security outside.
What's going on?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.725
My dad's men

14:53.559 --> 14:56.061
-Did you contact the ranch?
-They're already packing everything.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.106
-And the tunnel?
-Ready to make our first job.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.858
The first of many, bastard.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.277
And you don't even have beer to celebrate.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.571
First you work, and then
you celebrate, man.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.991
If I was your father's son
I'd always be celebrating, man.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.410
No way, Arturo.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.206
If we work this out,
I'm not only going to be El Chapo's son,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.834
I'll get my own name in the business.

15:19.835 --> 15:20.836
Let's go.

15:22.212 --> 15:25.215
Don't worry, man.
Everything is going to work out fine.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.010
Tell your father to get ready
'cause he's got a rival.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.724
-What's up?
-Sir.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.101
It's time to leave.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.352
I've never seen you before.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.646
They almost never send me here.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.982
My friend is going to be
a good boss, right?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.068
Better than his father.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.277
He looks like a nice person.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.532
I'm Arturo Meza.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.284
They call me El Metrico.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.286
Why?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.706
Because the bastard doesn't do lines

16:38.789 --> 16:40.124
if it's not per meters.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.474
Thank you, sir.

17:02.604 --> 17:05.983
Thanks for the company, guys.
From here on, we go alone.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.861
Well, I have orders not to leave.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.656
That's in Culiacan.
From now on, it's safe.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.744
Anyway, you won't fit in the small plane.

17:18.245 --> 17:20.748
-Then let me call ToÃ±o.
-I'm already telling you.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.667
I think that should be enough.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.294
Yes, sure.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.296
-Excuse me.
-No problem.

17:27.504 --> 17:30.090
-Give it to my dad, please.
-Yes, sir.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.343
Hey, Metrico.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.096
See you.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.189
Don Joaquin must be fucked up.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.356
CHAPO'S HITMEN'S RESIDENCE

17:50.652 --> 17:53.238
I think fucking Arturo
has already escaped.

17:53.781 --> 17:54.656
Why not?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.868
They won't leave us alone
until we find him.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.030
Sir.

19:20.409 --> 19:24.329
CULIACAN IS MINE CHAPO
YOU'RE NEXT

19:24.413 --> 19:26.874
SINCERELY, ARTURO B

19:57.654 --> 19:59.198
Amazing.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.040
Yes, sir, I'll let him know right now.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.374
Your dad.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.543
Thanks.

20:13.921 --> 20:14.838
Dad?

20:15.589 --> 20:17.549
Almost all the cargo is already
at the other side.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.884
<i>Congratulations, son.</i>

20:19.009 --> 20:20.969
<i>I'll be back in Culiacan in a bit</i>
<i>to celebrate.</i>

20:21.053 --> 20:22.095
That's why I'm calling...

20:23.680 --> 20:26.892
It's better you don't come back right now.
Things are getting very serious here.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.478
Did something happen?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.272
Nothing we can't take care of.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.108
When things calm down,
we can celebrate together.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.861
<i>Don't worry. Go take a walk, enjoy...</i>

20:38.528 --> 20:40.280
<i>Just don't tell anyone where you're going.</i>

20:40.530 --> 20:41.448
OK.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.369
Hey. Go with the men I sent you.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.498
It's OK, Dad. Did you get what I sent you?

20:50.457 --> 20:52.209
No. What did you send me?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.127
You'll see it when it gets there.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.838
<i>-OK then. Take care, son.</i>
-You too.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.718
What's up?

21:02.803 --> 21:04.388
It'd be better if we don't go back.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.265
Then where are we going?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.061
Let's celebrate it gringo style.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.906
Come in.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.741
We are taking the appropriate measures.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.909
That's all, thank you.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.705
How long did peace last?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.500
We're working to solve everything, Sir.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.127
That's not what I asked you.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.255
This is a mess.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.091
Because of you, the international
community is taking me to task.

21:41.758 --> 21:45.137
Why in the hell did you get out
Chapo's son so fast?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.765
It was an exchange
for the Bernal Leyda brothers.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.684
So where's Arturo?

21:50.851 --> 21:52.519
It's just a matter of time
until they find him.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.025
You're feeling very confident with your
post, Conrado.

21:59.818 --> 22:00.694
Don't take it for granted.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.115
With all due respect, Mr. President,

22:06.116 --> 22:09.286
this isn't the most appropriate moment
to try to intimidate me.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.459
Our only option is to support Joaquin

22:15.834 --> 22:17.753
so that he can take control definitively.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.880
We already gave him many chances.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.424
If we don't negotiate with him,
then with whom?

22:22.674 --> 22:24.259
With Cano and the Emes?

22:24.801 --> 22:25.844
They are psychopaths.

22:27.345 --> 22:30.182
We have to give him more men
in order to attack those territories

22:30.348 --> 22:31.641
and shield Culiacan.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.437
How many?

22:36.480 --> 22:37.314
An army.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.067
Winning this war won't be easy,

22:40.650 --> 22:43.779
but if we succeed,
everything will go back to normal.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.365
What is "normal"?

22:50.327 --> 22:53.371
OUTSIDE OF CULIACAN, MEXICO

23:00.420 --> 23:01.588
Have you talked with El Moreno?

23:01.671 --> 23:03.465
He's taking care
of his first deal.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.635
He's starting out better than I did.
He's going to be boss faster than me.

23:12.307 --> 23:13.725
The reinforcements arrived.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.187
Now Arturo is definitely not going to have
anywhere to hide.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.718
HUAMUYA NEIGHBORHOOD
EAST OF CULIACAN

24:06.069 --> 24:09.364
LAS QUINTAS NEIGHBORHOOD
NORTHEAST OF CULIACAN

24:37.267 --> 24:40.103
Let's see if we get to celebrate
with some pretty white chicks.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.104
And hot ones.

24:41.855 --> 24:44.941
How did you find out about this place if
you don't know a fucking word of English?

24:45.025 --> 24:47.485
Everything's possible, man. <i>Pregunteichon.</i>

24:55.827 --> 24:56.995
Hello.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.581
<i>-Spanish?</i>
-No.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.894
We want, uh, <i>cerveza. </i>Beer!

25:20.977 --> 25:21.978
Just beer.

25:23.146 --> 25:26.399
Ah! You want this.

25:28.902 --> 25:29.736
How much?

25:41.915 --> 25:43.291
How much do you want, asshole?

25:45.919 --> 25:47.212
Let's leave this place, asshole.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.977
When I own Chicago,
I'm going to buy this bar

26:02.143 --> 26:04.062
and make everyone call me as I deserve:

26:04.145 --> 26:05.063
as Sir.

26:05.814 --> 26:09.234
Not just as sir, man.
They'll call you "Don Sir."

26:09.442 --> 26:10.777
"Don Sir Boss."

26:11.569 --> 26:12.779
And the gringo will get fired.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.033
What are we doing here, man?
Let's go to Culiacan.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.451
Didn't your father tell you not to?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.621
I'm not going to stay in a fucking place
where they don't speak Spanish.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.665
Everything's going to be fine
if we go back...

26:23.832 --> 26:25.292
as long as nobody knows.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.377
Let's go then.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.476
Come on, motherfuckers!

27:24.559 --> 27:26.269
Kill that son of a bitch!

27:45.455 --> 27:49.000
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU ALL. ARTURO

27:53.797 --> 27:57.092
We can chase him
all day long, sir.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.353
No.

28:10.563 --> 28:13.733
That's what Arturo wants... for me to
make a mistake and get distracted.

28:15.568 --> 28:16.528
You stay with me.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.199
My head is the biggest prize for Arturo,
El Cano and El Chente,

28:22.158 --> 28:23.576
and I'm not going to hand it over.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.955
The military has no clue yet, sir.

28:27.747 --> 28:28.873
And Arturo is clever.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.584
He knows that if he attacks from the front
he won't stand a chance.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.630
He wants to scare us and make us go crazy
with all these strikes.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.007
He's provoking us so we go out
looking for him

28:38.133 --> 28:40.093
and leave Culiacan defenseless.

28:41.636 --> 28:44.222
Let's do the opposite.
We're not going anywhere.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.183
Let's declare curfew in the town.

28:49.644 --> 28:50.687
Take care of it.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.495
What's that?

29:13.460 --> 29:14.794
It was sent by El Moreno.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.813
The Americans are very pleased with him.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.733
Let things calm down and we'll throw him

29:36.816 --> 29:38.860
a party he'll never forget.

29:43.656 --> 29:46.326
I feel like after this travel,
I'm going to sleep for two days straight.

29:46.409 --> 29:47.535
FERIA GANADERA NEIGHBORHOOD
MAY 7, 2008

29:48.995 --> 29:51.873
I told you they'd know
when we got back, man.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.710
I'll take care of it.
Let me do the talking.

30:10.683 --> 30:11.726
Where are you headed?

30:12.352 --> 30:13.812
I'm Don Joaquin's son.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.024
That's El Moreno.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.695
Excuse me, young man, but shouldn't
you have security guards with you?

30:23.112 --> 30:25.949
You don't have to worry about that,
I just need a favor...

30:27.575 --> 30:29.994
Don't tell my dad you saw me out here.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.872
It's your father's orders, young man.

30:33.790 --> 30:37.710
I'm not asking you to lie, just to forget
that you saw us passing by.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.337
I'm going home now.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.217
-As you command, boss.
-Yeah.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.427
Split it up.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.054
Let's go.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.525
We need results, Joaquin.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.943
<i>Not only you...</i>

31:02.819 --> 31:06.114
Between your people and mine
we should've already found Arturo.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.074
But that motherfucker knows how to move.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.159
<i>We gave you what you asked.</i>

31:10.243 --> 31:11.953
The army and the federal police
have been supporting

31:12.036 --> 31:13.621
your attacks against Juarez
and Nuevo Laredo,

31:14.414 --> 31:16.374
<i>but El Cano and Chente have fully proven</i>
<i>that they know how</i>

31:16.457 --> 31:17.542
<i>to defend their territories.</i>

31:17.667 --> 31:20.503
Once again there are too many dead.
That was not the deal.

31:20.795 --> 31:24.173
What's up, Conrado?
Are you losing faith in me?

31:25.592 --> 31:28.261
I'm not going to lie to you,
the President is getting tired.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.930
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

31:31.264 --> 31:34.517
If you don't have results soon,
not even I can protect you.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.192
Don't fool around, man! It's already 5:30!

32:07.258 --> 32:08.551
If you wake me up, I'll kill you.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.438
<i>Good morning, Culiacan.</i>

32:20.521 --> 32:24.067
<i>As many of you know,</i>
<i>there is an anonymous email going around</i>

32:24.150 --> 32:27.612
<i>indicating that the Sinaloa Cartel</i>
<i>has declared a curfew in town</i>

32:27.695 --> 32:29.572
<i>starting today at 6:00 p.m.</i>

32:31.240 --> 32:32.659
PREPARE YOURSELF CHAPO

32:32.742 --> 32:35.495
NOT EVEN THE ENTIRE ARMY
WILL BE ABLE TO HELP

32:35.578 --> 32:37.956
CULIACAN IS MINE
SINCERELY, ARTURO

32:38.623 --> 32:41.000
<i>This is serious, dear listeners.</i>

32:41.084 --> 32:44.504
<i>There's a war between Arturo Bernal Leyda</i>
<i>and El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n.</i>

33:17.620 --> 33:19.664
Make sure everyone's patrolling the town.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.548
Today we have to find Arturo Bernal.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.041
8:00 P.M.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.739
-What time is it?
-Eight o'clock.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.033
Are you kidding?
Eight o'clock at night?

34:42.288 --> 34:43.539
I'm fucking hungry.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.585
-Let's have something at the mall.
-OK.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.896
Why is everything closed today?

35:19.408 --> 35:20.284
What's going on, man?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.246
Something's happened.

35:51.774 --> 35:55.319
I think when you were a baby
they gave you coke instead of milk.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.831
I can handle it.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.348
More?

36:25.558 --> 36:27.143
Are you crazy? One more?

36:29.478 --> 36:31.355
Easy. It's not my first time.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.244
ALAMEDA NEIGHBORHOOD

36:55.713 --> 36:58.382
What the heck, man? This is so weird.

36:58.674 --> 37:01.260
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to call my dad.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.595
Why would you, man?

37:02.678 --> 37:05.097
He's gonna kick your ass
if he knows you're back.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.391
It's better than not knowing
what's going on.

37:10.853 --> 37:12.688
It's out of batteries. Give me yours.

37:13.481 --> 37:17.068
No, asshole. I left mine at your place.
But you can find a charger in there.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.956
Look at that motherfucker.

37:34.919 --> 37:35.920
What about that one?

37:38.798 --> 37:41.676
You'd better not die, dumbass!

37:45.346 --> 37:46.180
Arturo!

37:46.639 --> 37:48.808
-Where?
-There, in the van!

37:48.933 --> 37:50.935
Arturo's there, bro! Arturo's there!

37:51.018 --> 37:53.020
I repeat, we found Arturo Bernal Leyda.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.774
Kill him!

37:57.608 --> 37:58.859
Go! Go!

37:58.943 --> 38:00.695
-Now you're dead...
-Kill him?

38:03.197 --> 38:04.156
It's on.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.579
No! It's Arturo Meza!

38:51.787 --> 38:53.998
No! No!

39:11.265 --> 39:12.266
No!

39:19.648 --> 39:20.524
<i>Hello?</i>

39:22.777 --> 39:23.611
<i>Hello?</i>

39:25.196 --> 39:26.113
