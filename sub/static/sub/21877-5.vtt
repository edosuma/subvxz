WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:04.000
Is someone
in here with us?

00:07.400 --> 00:09.667
There it is.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.500
It's right in that corner.

00:15.633 --> 00:17.533
They both have been strangled

00:17.533 --> 00:21.700
by an unseen entity
in the house.

00:21.700 --> 00:25.300
It was deemed as
"The murder of the century."

00:27.200 --> 00:28.700
This can't be right.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.267
Oh, god.

00:34.767 --> 00:36.833
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.500
I was only 8
when a paranormal incident

00:39.500 --> 00:41.100
changed my life forever.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.600
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:44.600 --> 00:48.400
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.867
I'm Adam Berry.

00:49.867 --> 00:52.467
More than a decade ago,
an encounter at gettysburg

00:52.467 --> 00:54.833
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.933
Together,
we uncover the truth

00:56.933 --> 00:58.567
behind
the unexplainable.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.267
Oh.
Oh, my god.

01:00.267 --> 01:03.400
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.300
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:07.300 --> 01:11.667
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:11.667 --> 01:14.667
synced by dom.smrc

01:21.900 --> 01:25.533
There is a case here
by a lady named Delanne.

01:25.533 --> 01:26.967
She's had experiences.

01:26.967 --> 01:31.233
Her husband and her children
have had experiences.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.867
Two of the oldest kids
have experienced

01:33.867 --> 01:37.533
actual physical attacks on them.

01:37.533 --> 01:39.633
They both have been strangled

01:39.633 --> 01:42.267
by an unseen entity
in the house.

01:44.867 --> 01:46.067
Every single person
in this house

01:46.067 --> 01:48.567
has experienced
something paranormal.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.633
I know that you're...
You seem a little on edge.

01:56.633 --> 01:58.267
- Yeah.
- Just judging by

01:58.267 --> 02:00.167
some of the stuff
you told us before we got here.

02:00.167 --> 02:03.267
The reason that I made contact
with you originally

02:03.267 --> 02:05.833
is that once
we switched bedrooms

02:05.833 --> 02:07.833
around
about two months ago,

02:07.833 --> 02:10.600
it kicked off a lot of
really weird activity.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.133
Okay.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.567
It's to the point where we
don't know what else to do.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.800
So, that's just been in
the last few months then?

02:15.800 --> 02:18.067
That's just in
the last few months.

02:18.067 --> 02:20.833
We've had activity
since we moved in.

02:20.833 --> 02:23.467
There's been activity steady
for about nine years.

02:23.467 --> 02:26.400
So, a decade of,
like, torture?

02:26.400 --> 02:27.433
Yes.

02:27.433 --> 02:28.467
This is our house.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.467
I want to provide
a safe environment

02:30.467 --> 02:31.833
for my family
to live.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.667
It's aggravating.

02:33.667 --> 02:34.800
So,
you want to start in here?

02:34.800 --> 02:36.667
Does anything go on
in the kitchen?

02:36.667 --> 02:40.133
Up above the counter
is a cupboard with glasses,

02:40.133 --> 02:42.233
and I had cleaned
the whole kitchen,

02:42.233 --> 02:46.167
and I came out of the living
room into the kitchen,

02:46.167 --> 02:49.267
and there was a glass
just randomly sitting there

02:49.267 --> 02:52.067
on the counter that
hadn't been there before.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.700
When I asked my kids
where it came from,

02:53.700 --> 02:57.967
they said that the man brought
it out from the living room.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.567
- Hmm.
- Kind of threw me.

03:00.567 --> 03:01.767
I said, "What man?"

03:01.767 --> 03:04.833
And they said, "The man
that brought the glass."

03:04.833 --> 03:07.933
Is there anybody in your life
that, maybe...

03:07.933 --> 03:10.333
That was close to you
that you lost?

03:10.333 --> 03:13.167
My brother died
when I was 20.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.233
What was his name?

03:14.233 --> 03:15.333
Daniel.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.467
Now, in this area specifically,

03:18.467 --> 03:20.367
have you guys had
any experiences?

03:20.367 --> 03:23.267
My youngest son, adric,
used to stand right over here,

03:23.267 --> 03:26.200
and he would look up the
staircase and talk to a man.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.833
He would stand here
and say,

03:29.833 --> 03:31.700
"No, I can't come up
the stairs right now,

03:31.700 --> 03:35.067
and I can't come play with you."

03:35.067 --> 03:38.067
I even had my first visual
sighting of the man.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.167
Where was that?

03:39.167 --> 03:42.733
He was down at the bottom
of the stairs.

03:42.733 --> 03:45.433
I saw a man standing on
the landing downstairs for...

03:45.433 --> 03:47.900
- Right there.
- Yes, right down there.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.600
And it was clear enough
so that I actually sort of

03:50.600 --> 03:52.133
jumped back
a little and went,

03:52.133 --> 03:53.267
"Whoa!
What the heck is that?"

03:53.267 --> 03:55.667
And I looked around,
and by the time

03:55.667 --> 03:57.967
I looked back over there,
it wasn't there.

03:57.967 --> 04:00.300
And could you tell what
color hair he had or anything?

04:00.300 --> 04:02.300
It definitely seemed
to have dark hair.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.167
Did it give you
a time period?

04:04.167 --> 04:07.967
Would you say like 1800s,
1700s, 1900s?

04:07.967 --> 04:10.767
I would say like 1940s.

04:10.767 --> 04:12.667
- Okay.
- Clothing style.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.166
So, this is Macy's room.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.367
Delanne: Mm-hmm.

04:17.367 --> 04:20.067
Macy and adric used
to share this room.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.867
So, this is the shuffle
that you did

04:21.867 --> 04:23.333
that really
peaked the activity.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.967
Really kicked off the activity
in the past couple of months.

04:25.967 --> 04:28.067
Yes.
Okay. All right.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.233
So, what's going on in here
that's freaking

04:29.233 --> 04:30.633
Macy out so badly?

04:30.633 --> 04:33.733
The first night that everybody
was in their own rooms,

04:33.733 --> 04:38.467
I stood in the hallway, and
I heard a low, gravelly voice.

04:38.467 --> 04:41.667
Macy was in bed, and she said,
"Mommy, is it okay?"

04:41.667 --> 04:43.800
And I said, "Yeah,
everything's fine, sweetheart."

04:43.800 --> 04:46.067
So, about 1:00 in the morning,
she came in and said,

04:46.067 --> 04:48.167
"I'm too scared.
I want to sleep with you."

04:48.167 --> 04:49.700
When we woke up, I said,

04:49.700 --> 04:52.233
"Well, why didn't you want to
sleep in your bed last night?"

04:52.233 --> 04:55.800
And she said, "I heard
something say my name."

04:55.800 --> 04:58.067
Oh, so you heard
the same thing?

04:58.067 --> 05:01.600
I heard something at the same
time she heard it say her name.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.867
This is the door
that leads to the attic.

05:05.867 --> 05:08.400
So,
you don't go up there?

05:08.400 --> 05:13.133
I have a kind of severe
phobia about the attic.

05:13.133 --> 05:14.533
Why is that?

05:14.533 --> 05:16.567
There has been a lot
of activity up there,

05:16.567 --> 05:20.100
and especially recently
with my teenage son.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.767
He took over the attic room

05:21.767 --> 05:24.167
where my older son
had been before that.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.433
It was the middle of the night,

05:26.433 --> 05:29.500
and he came flying
down these stairs,

05:29.500 --> 05:32.967
and he turned and he points
to the stairway, and he says,

05:32.967 --> 05:34.300
"There is a ghost up there,

05:34.300 --> 05:36.633
and it just tried
to expletive kill me."

05:39.233 --> 05:40.533
He felt like
he couldn't breathe,

05:40.533 --> 05:42.800
and he felt as if there were
hands around his neck

05:42.800 --> 05:45.133
choking him.

05:45.133 --> 05:47.333
Both of the boys who had
their bedrooms up in the attic

05:47.333 --> 05:49.767
have both had the sensation
of being choked.

05:49.767 --> 05:53.433
So, there is consistency
in their stories,

05:53.433 --> 05:55.333
and I think that's
important to note

05:55.333 --> 05:56.933
because it kind of
seems like then

05:56.933 --> 06:00.933
it would most obviously be
from the same entity.

06:00.933 --> 06:03.933
Have you tried to do
any research on your house?

06:03.933 --> 06:06.800
I don't know if it's connected
at all to this investigation,

06:06.800 --> 06:09.767
but in the backyard
there is a gravestone

06:09.767 --> 06:11.933
of a world war I veteran.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.800
So, like a memorial plaque?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.600
It's actually
a granite stone.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.867
A tombstone.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.833
My husband unearthed
the gravestone

06:18.833 --> 06:21.500
when we were making space
for the shed that's out there.

06:25.233 --> 06:29.500
Yeah, I was just leveling
the land here to put the shed in

06:29.500 --> 06:32.900
and dug down about
four feet or so,

06:32.900 --> 06:35.633
and I saw this big
piece of slate,

06:35.633 --> 06:38.467
but this piece of slate
had that cross on the top.

06:38.467 --> 06:40.367
So I picked it up
and washed it off,

06:40.367 --> 06:42.200
and I noticed all the words,
and, "Oh, my gosh."

06:42.200 --> 06:43.767
It's a tombstone."

06:43.767 --> 06:46.200
That's definitely
a strange twist.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.533
Well,
we'll research it

06:47.533 --> 06:49.067
and see if there's any
connection to the house.

06:49.067 --> 06:52.100
It could have some connection
to someone who lived here.

06:53.567 --> 06:57.233
I know if I found a headstone
or tombstone in my backyard,

06:57.233 --> 06:58.733
I would be freaking out,

06:58.733 --> 07:02.867
but any time we have a case
where there's children involved,

07:02.867 --> 07:05.933
those kind of go to the top
of the priority list.

07:05.933 --> 07:08.767
And so, it's gonna be
really important in this case

07:08.767 --> 07:11.433
that we sit down with all
the kids individually

07:11.433 --> 07:13.433
and get their stories.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.567
Can you tell me just kind
of what happened up here

07:17.567 --> 07:20.767
that freaked you out
so badly?

07:20.767 --> 07:23.833
Well, it was the middle
of the night,

07:23.833 --> 07:27.100
and I felt something
around my neck,

07:27.100 --> 07:28.333
just kind of squeezing.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.300
And did it feel
like hands, or...

07:34.300 --> 07:35.533
Oh, yeah.

07:35.533 --> 07:36.967
I mean, with everything
that's going on here,

07:36.967 --> 07:38.833
do you think that
your house is haunted?

07:38.833 --> 07:39.900
Yeah.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.567
I saw this faint
shadow of a man,

07:42.567 --> 07:46.600
and he was standing, like, right
at the door of Macy's room,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.767
and he did not have
a smile on his face.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.533
I know
he was not happy.

07:50.533 --> 07:52.733
What did he say?
Did he say anything?

07:52.733 --> 07:55.067
This is
exactly what he said...

07:55.067 --> 07:58.300
"Vicki, Vicki, Vicki."

07:58.300 --> 08:00.800
Do you know a Vicki?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.067
No, not at all.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.600
So, I know your older
brother Feyd

08:04.600 --> 08:06.367
had an experience upstairs
where he felt like

08:06.367 --> 08:07.500
he was being strangled.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.633
Yes.

08:08.633 --> 08:09.800
Like, when Feyd moves
out of the house,

08:09.800 --> 08:11.333
are you gonna
move upstairs?

08:11.333 --> 08:15.300
I'm not going to want to because
I've heard all these stories

08:15.300 --> 08:18.367
about people being strangled
because of a ghost.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.567
Do you feel like
you're next?

08:20.567 --> 08:21.900
Yes.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.333
Are you scared
in your house?

08:24.333 --> 08:25.333
Yes.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.633
In every room
of the house?

08:27.633 --> 08:31.267
What is the scariest thing
about the house to you?

08:31.267 --> 08:34.533
I heard someone kept,
like, saying my name.

08:34.533 --> 08:35.933
Mm-hmm.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.267
But, like, sort of quietly,
and it had a scratchy voice.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.067
Okay.
Did it sound like a man?

08:40.067 --> 08:41.400
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.867
So, you heard the voice,
and now, did you ever see a man?

08:44.867 --> 08:46.067
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.867
I saw someone
right across from me.

08:49.867 --> 08:52.467
I saw a guy with only
a white face.

08:52.467 --> 08:56.867
So, if I was able to talk
to the ghost,

08:56.867 --> 08:59.833
what would you want me
to tell it for you?

08:59.833 --> 09:02.867
"Please stop bothering me
and my family."

09:04.000 --> 09:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:13.400 --> 09:14.600
Every single person
in this house

09:14.600 --> 09:16.667
has experienced
something paranormal...

09:16.667 --> 09:19.200
Something they really
cannot explain.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.233
Amy and I have a lot of work
to do for this case.

09:22.233 --> 09:23.633
There's a lot at stake here.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.500
Tonight, we're gonna focus on.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.800
Macy's room to begin with,

09:26.800 --> 09:29.067
just because there's such
a sense of urgency there.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.433
We really need to try
to communicate

09:31.433 --> 09:35.400
with whatever might be
trying to contact her.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.467
So, we're headed upstairs
to conduct an EVP session.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.767
I just turned on
the recorder.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.433
Now, whoever is here
in this house,

09:47.433 --> 09:49.933
do you know who we are?

09:52.533 --> 09:54.700
Are you related
to Delanne?

09:57.900 --> 10:00.467
Are you her brother?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.867
Can you tell me
what the names are

10:04.867 --> 10:07.200
of the children
who live in this house?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.367
Let's listen.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.600
You asked for the names
of the children in the house.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.433
Play that again.

10:34.833 --> 10:35.867
"Macy."

10:57.100 --> 10:58.533
"Macy."

10:58.533 --> 11:00.800
Oh, god.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.767
It's so, like...
When you...

11:04.767 --> 11:08.067
When that's the first thing
it says, it's like why?

11:08.067 --> 11:12.100
Want to talk to them.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.933
Even after we die.

11:15.933 --> 11:18.067
- Mm-hmm.
- So, whoever's here,

11:19.233 --> 11:21.900
living here.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.167
It's just that we're still
at that stage

11:23.167 --> 11:25.567
where it's like,
who is it?

11:25.567 --> 11:28.700
This is a weird one because
it's not like they suspect

11:28.700 --> 11:30.100
it's someone they know,

11:30.100 --> 11:31.367
although it could be
her brother.

11:31.367 --> 11:33.833
Mm-hmm. There's a lot of
questions unanswered.

11:33.833 --> 11:34.933
We just need to keep going.

11:38.367 --> 11:40.900
Dan, are you here?

11:43.267 --> 11:46.567
Have you been watching Macy
and watching her grow up?

11:51.067 --> 11:53.533
Do you know Vicki?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.267
Were you looking
for Vicki?

12:16.067 --> 12:19.833
We are getting nothing.

12:19.833 --> 12:24.433
So, so far we've heard
Macy's name pretty clearly.

12:24.433 --> 12:26.733
I mean, there's the claim
in the attic with the choking,

12:26.733 --> 12:31.233
and, like, you know,
I'm sure Delanne is concerned...

12:31.233 --> 12:32.967
Is it gonna happen
to the daughter?

12:32.967 --> 12:37.233
Like, since the spirit only
attacked Delanne's sons so far,

12:37.233 --> 12:39.567
maybe
I should go upstairs?

12:39.567 --> 12:41.433
You go in the attic
by yourself?

12:41.433 --> 12:43.067
Yeah.

12:54.500 --> 12:59.100
I am a friend of Delanne
and Wayne.

12:59.100 --> 13:02.367
They've seen you.

13:02.367 --> 13:06.267
They hear you.

13:06.267 --> 13:10.400
They don't know you.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.967
Have you choked Feyd?

13:15.933 --> 13:18.267
What do you want?

13:23.100 --> 13:25.433
I'm gonna lay right here.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.500
See if anything chokes me.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.867
If you're here, and you want
to take this opportunity

13:34.867 --> 13:37.167
and get my attention,

13:37.167 --> 13:40.067
Feyd said
they've been choked up here,

13:40.067 --> 13:44.233
so if you want to do that,
you can do that.

13:58.533 --> 14:03.067
Amy, if you want to come
up here and listen to this.

14:20.467 --> 14:23.267
Nothing.

14:23.267 --> 14:25.067
And we didn't get anything
related to, like,

14:25.067 --> 14:26.633
the choking thing.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.900
The chances of it actually
choking one of us

14:30.900 --> 14:33.300
is slim to none.

14:33.300 --> 14:36.433
The biggest concern
that I have right now is,

14:36.433 --> 14:38.767
yes, great,
something is reaching out.

14:38.767 --> 14:43.100
Something is saying "Macy,"
but who is it?

14:43.100 --> 14:46.067
I think that if it were
a relative of Delanne's,

14:46.067 --> 14:48.267
I think that they would
have said something to us.

14:48.267 --> 14:49.933
I need to talk to her
'cause I want ask her

14:49.933 --> 14:51.433
some other stuff,
too, and I just...

14:51.433 --> 14:54.233
I feel like I need to get,
like, really personal with her.

15:03.067 --> 15:06.067
So, first of all, did you learn
anything about the house,

15:06.067 --> 15:08.867
maybe when you bought it?
Never. Nope.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.067
There was so much
paperwork going on

15:10.067 --> 15:11.400
and shuffling
the paperwork around,

15:11.400 --> 15:12.933
that really we didn't
get to check.

15:12.933 --> 15:18.933
Okay, so, if you had to guess
at as to who is here,

15:18.933 --> 15:22.700
who's haunting this place,
who would you think it is?

15:22.700 --> 15:24.400
You know, I don't know.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.367
As far as
just kind of talking

15:26.367 --> 15:28.833
about the fear level
in the house...

15:28.833 --> 15:29.900
Oh, yeah.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.367
Lots and lots of that.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.367
Yeah,
especially with your kids.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.667
- Yeah.
- But Macy's the one...

15:34.667 --> 15:37.233
Macy is the big one

15:37.233 --> 15:41.700
that is really affected
by the situation.

15:41.700 --> 15:45.133
When I tuck her in at night,
she is...

15:45.133 --> 15:47.867
She's so terrified,
you know, or she's shaking.

15:47.867 --> 15:49.067
Yeah.

15:49.067 --> 15:51.200
And her eyes
are wide with fear.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.067
You know, I have to turn
and walk away.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.400
Yeah.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.833
And that is so hard for me
to walk into my bedroom

15:57.833 --> 16:00.067
knowing that my daughter
is alone and afraid.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.467
Mm-hmm. I know.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.067
As a mom, I can't...

16:03.067 --> 16:04.233
She's my little,
sweet angel,

16:04.233 --> 16:08.267
and I would do anything
to help her feel safe.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.367
This entire family is terrified,

16:10.367 --> 16:11.867
but whatever's
haunting this house

16:11.867 --> 16:13.800
doesn't seem family related.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.667
There must be something
else going on here.

16:16.667 --> 16:17.900
It just wouldn't make sense

16:17.900 --> 16:19.500
if it was Delanne's brother
in the house.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.567
He would never
strangle the kids.

16:27.867 --> 16:31.667
I'm working on
a house nearby.

16:31.667 --> 16:34.433
That family is really
freaked out about it.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.500
They have activity
unexplained,

16:36.500 --> 16:38.733
there's kids involved,
and the kids are terrified,

16:38.733 --> 16:40.800
and so, we're kind of
looking at every single option

16:40.800 --> 16:44.467
about who would be in
the property or on the property.

16:44.467 --> 16:45.900
Mm-hmm.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.067
So, I have a specific question
about the surrounding area.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.900
Do you guys have any info
on significant deaths nearby?

16:51.900 --> 16:53.067
- We do, yes.
- You do?

16:53.067 --> 16:54.200
We do.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.733
It was deemed as
"The murder of the century."

16:57.733 --> 16:58.933
Wow.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.300
About the surround area.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.700
On significant deaths nearby?

17:19.700 --> 17:20.867
- We do, yes.
- You do?

17:20.867 --> 17:22.067
We do.

17:22.067 --> 17:25.833
It was deemed as
"The murder of the century."

17:25.833 --> 17:27.300
Wow.

17:27.300 --> 17:32.833
In 1897, Joseph Kelley came in
to great falls national bank

17:32.833 --> 17:37.100
and actually murdered
the cashier at the bank.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.800
What did Joseph do
to the man?

17:39.800 --> 17:41.700
He cut his throat
from ear to ear.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.533
Oh, god.

17:44.533 --> 17:47.067
How far away
was the bank

17:47.067 --> 17:49.100
compared to where the house
is that we're investigating?

17:49.100 --> 17:51.333
It was a couple of blocks.
A couple of streets over.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.433
- Okay. So, really close?
- It was really close. Yeah.

17:53.433 --> 17:54.833
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:59.367 --> 18:01.700
It is an absolutely
terrible murder,

18:01.700 --> 18:03.600
and it was very close
to this house.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.133
We will use that information
in our investigation

18:06.133 --> 18:10.200
because again, we have to look
at every single possible option.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.533
I looked at the deeds.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.533
There was probably like
five or six families

18:14.533 --> 18:17.700
who've lived here since
the house was built in 1855.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.300
But adric said he saw a man
in the backyard saying,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.400
"Vicki, Vicki, Vicki."

18:22.400 --> 18:24.667
This is exactly what he said...

18:24.667 --> 18:27.700
"Vicki, Vicki, Vicki."

18:27.700 --> 18:29.900
Vicki was the former homeowner.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.067
That's strange.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.633
- That's really wild.
- Yeah.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.333
She's coming over tomorrow
so we can talk to her.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.133
Did you find out
anything else today?

18:37.133 --> 18:42.667
In 1897, there was a murder at
the bank that was nearby here,

18:42.667 --> 18:45.100
and this man, Joseph Kelley,

18:45.100 --> 18:48.367
came in and slit
the throat of another man.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.867
The murderer fits
the description.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.667
Hmm. This murder is
super interesting.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.533
- It's worth looking at for sure.
- It's worth a try.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.567
So why don't we just
get moving on that?

18:57.567 --> 18:59.300
All right.

19:09.933 --> 19:11.800
We have other leads
to chase down,

19:11.800 --> 19:13.800
like the gravestone
in the backyard,

19:13.800 --> 19:16.400
but first, we're gonna focus
on the murderer Joseph Kelley

19:16.400 --> 19:18.300
because his violent m.o.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.400
Lines up with
the paranormal choking.

19:23.167 --> 19:26.600
Wrote, but it's his will.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.900
His will within a poem form,

19:28.900 --> 19:30.133
and it's very bizarre.

19:30.133 --> 19:33.200
I'm gonna use this
as a trigger object.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.467
"To my junior council,
Mr. Ryan,"

19:35.467 --> 19:37.300
I give this small Blackjack

19:37.300 --> 19:43.100
with which I struck the kind
cashier a well-directed crack.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.067
The straps and chloroform
you may equally divide.

19:47.067 --> 19:52.667
They led me to the awful crime
by which the cashier died.

19:52.667 --> 19:56.067
As my council and advisors,
I trust that you will see

19:56.067 --> 19:59.267
"that after I am dead,
dissected I shall be."

19:59.267 --> 20:01.700
Wow.

20:04.267 --> 20:08.133
Mr. Kelley, we were just reading
some of your poetry.

20:12.300 --> 20:16.133
Do you feel guilty for what
you did to that poor cashier?

20:18.700 --> 20:21.733
They said
you committed a murder.

20:21.733 --> 20:24.400
You were put on trial,
and you were found guilty of it.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.000
Is this true?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.467
Do you have a message
for the family who lives here?

20:34.267 --> 20:36.533
Are you choking them?

20:42.667 --> 20:47.067
Mr. Kelley, is there a reason
why you're still here?

20:53.367 --> 20:56.133
If we're not speaking
with Mr. Kelley,

20:56.133 --> 20:57.767
who are
we speaking with?

21:18.100 --> 21:19.367
"No."

21:19.367 --> 21:20.867
"No."

21:27.067 --> 21:28.800
"No"?

21:28.800 --> 21:30.533
It's probably not him.

21:55.933 --> 21:57.467
"No"?

22:04.767 --> 22:06.633
"No."

22:09.667 --> 22:10.800
"No."

22:10.800 --> 22:12.533
It's probably not him.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.800
Somebody else is like, "No."
"No."

22:17.567 --> 22:19.233
Maybe there's more
than one spirit here.

22:19.233 --> 22:21.067
I mean,
but who could it be?

22:25.233 --> 22:27.567
We literally could just have
a dart board of names

22:27.567 --> 22:28.700
and just start
throwing darts.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.567
- Mm-hmm.
- I have no clue.

22:30.567 --> 22:34.067
What if the choking
isn't paranormal at all?

22:34.067 --> 22:38.600
I wonder if the sleep
disturbances might be natural?

22:38.600 --> 22:39.700
Yeah.

22:39.700 --> 22:43.133
Or maybe Feyd had
a psychological episode.

22:43.133 --> 22:45.667
I mean, it could be
a possibility.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.533
I also think
it's a sensitive subject.

22:47.533 --> 22:51.333
I mean, I'm not
discounting it entirely...

22:51.333 --> 22:52.733
Right.

22:52.733 --> 22:55.700
...but maybe we should start
considering other explanations.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.467
Yeah.

22:57.467 --> 23:00.267
We're just not getting
any indication

23:00.267 --> 23:03.767
that whatever is in this house
is violent or aggressive.

23:03.767 --> 23:06.900
Certainly not something
that would choke a young boy.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.700
I want to find out if there are
any non-paranormal conditions

23:09.700 --> 23:11.233
that could cause this.

23:11.233 --> 23:14.800
And so, today I am going
to video chat

23:14.800 --> 23:16.700
with a clinical psychologist

23:16.700 --> 23:18.400
and just kind of ask her

23:18.400 --> 23:20.900
about what happened
with Quinn and Feyd

23:20.900 --> 23:24.400
and see, you know, what she
thinks of those experiences.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.967
The time to talk to me.

23:28.567 --> 23:31.067
We're working on a case
right now with a family

23:31.067 --> 23:34.767
who their two sons
have both had some episodes.

23:34.767 --> 23:40.633
The older son woke up
multiple times during his teens

23:40.633 --> 23:43.900
feeling as though something
was strangling him,

23:43.900 --> 23:46.433
and then his brother
moved into that same room,

23:46.433 --> 23:50.167
and, again, in his teens
had one episodes

23:50.167 --> 23:52.233
where he said
he could feel hands

23:52.233 --> 23:54.233
around his neck
strangling him.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.300
Mm-hmm.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.433
So does that sound
familiar to you?

23:58.433 --> 24:03.067
Night terrors or sleep paralysis
are types of parasomnias,

24:03.067 --> 24:06.100
and sleep paralysis can happen

24:06.100 --> 24:08.667
usually either
upon falling asleep

24:08.667 --> 24:10.300
or right when waking.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.400
Mm-hmm.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.233
It usually has
an onset as a teenager,

24:14.233 --> 24:17.900
and usually waking up
without being able to move,

24:17.900 --> 24:19.900
sometimes not being
able to speak,

24:19.900 --> 24:21.833
but people can hallucinate.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.433
They can feel things.

24:23.433 --> 24:25.333
And it's interesting
that it happened

24:25.333 --> 24:26.700
when they are teenagers.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.433
Hey, is that something that
could just happen one time

24:28.433 --> 24:30.233
and never happen again?

24:30.233 --> 24:31.867
- Yes.
- Okay.

24:31.867 --> 24:36.067
I guess my question is is
that type of thing hereditary?

24:36.067 --> 24:37.433
It can be.

24:37.433 --> 24:39.867
They don't have perfect links
for these parasomnias,

24:39.867 --> 24:42.667
but they do see
genetic links.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.300
I believe that
they do see that

24:44.300 --> 24:46.233
with first-degree,
biological relatives,

24:46.233 --> 24:47.667
it's more common.

24:47.667 --> 24:50.867
Okay, and also, just the fact
that he moved into that room

24:50.867 --> 24:52.233
kind of feeling

24:52.233 --> 24:54.867
like that had happened
to his older brother,

24:54.867 --> 24:56.133
so, I'm wondering if maybe
there was some sort

24:56.133 --> 24:58.400
of subconscious cause.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.767
If we hear something might
happen in a certain place,

25:01.767 --> 25:03.767
we're probably more likely
to think about it

25:03.767 --> 25:05.167
and even have it
in our head.

25:05.167 --> 25:07.167
That gives me a lot
to go on with this family

25:07.167 --> 25:09.267
'cause I don't want
them to be scared.

25:09.267 --> 25:10.433
Sure.

25:10.433 --> 25:12.633
Well, thank you so much
for taking the time.

25:12.633 --> 25:14.700
- Nice meeting you.
- Thanks. You, too.

25:14.700 --> 25:18.233
We got some great information
from the psychologist

25:18.233 --> 25:20.733
that will be useful to Delanne.

25:20.733 --> 25:24.667
Now we need to look
into the headstone.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.133
Let's see.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.700
I know if I found a headstone,

25:28.700 --> 25:29.933
I'd wonder whose it was.

25:29.933 --> 25:31.267
Why is it in my yard?

25:31.267 --> 25:32.433
Where did it come from?

25:32.433 --> 25:34.700
We need to figure out
who this poor person is,

25:34.700 --> 25:37.067
and why is their headstone here?

25:38.933 --> 25:40.600
Okay.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.467
Adam.
Yeah?

25:42.467 --> 25:44.100
Adam Berry,
come here right now.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.067
- What?
- You need to check this out.

25:46.067 --> 25:47.233
Okay.

25:47.233 --> 25:50.767
So, this is a purple-heart.
Receiving veteran.

25:50.767 --> 25:54.667
- Mm-hmm.
- He started a local vfw.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.133
Take a look at this.
Mmhmm.

25:56.133 --> 25:58.567
This is our headstone that's
in the backyard right now.

25:58.567 --> 26:01.133
- Yeah.
- Read that man's name for me.

26:01.133 --> 26:02.933
- "Hollis B. Corbett."
- All right.

26:02.933 --> 26:05.867
Now, this is where
Mr. Corbett is buried.

26:05.867 --> 26:07.933
Please read
that headstone for me.

26:07.933 --> 26:11.133
"Hollie B. Corbett."

26:11.133 --> 26:13.867
Everything is literally the same
but the "E" and the "S."

26:13.867 --> 26:15.167
Yeah, and then look.

26:15.167 --> 26:17.800
I found the application
right here that was submitted

26:17.800 --> 26:19.800
by his wife
who signed it.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
Yeah.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.733
"Hollis B. Corbett."

26:23.733 --> 26:27.500
So, Mr. Corbett
has been buried

26:27.500 --> 26:30.433
with the incorrect headstone
for the last 70 years.

26:30.433 --> 26:32.133
- Oh, my god.
- Guess what else.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.067
He also had two daughters,

26:34.067 --> 26:36.233
one of whom died
when she was very young.

26:36.233 --> 26:37.600
Huh.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.500
I'm just sitting here
wondering how this got here.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.900
Why is this headstone
in their backyard?

26:43.900 --> 26:45.367
That's so weird.

26:45.367 --> 26:46.433
Yeah.

26:51.867 --> 26:54.367
Fortunately for us, we were able
to get in touch with Vicki.

26:54.367 --> 26:56.767
She was the previous owner
before this family.

26:56.767 --> 26:59.633
The thing that's interesting
is that adric had an experience

26:59.633 --> 27:01.800
where he saw the apparition
of a gentleman.

27:01.800 --> 27:05.133
The man said, "Vicki, Vicki,
Vicki" three times.

27:05.133 --> 27:06.833
He had no idea who Vicki was,

27:06.833 --> 27:08.300
and she's gonna
come by the house,

27:08.300 --> 27:11.800
and we're gonna talk about
that tombstone in the backyard.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.100
The reason why we're here

27:13.100 --> 27:17.100
is because the current
homeowners have had

27:17.100 --> 27:18.500
what they describe as

27:18.500 --> 27:20.733
paranormal-type activity
in the house.

27:20.733 --> 27:23.433
Have you ever had any activity
happen in the house?

27:23.433 --> 27:25.400
Oh...

27:25.400 --> 27:27.633
I do remember being
in the attic one time,

27:27.633 --> 27:30.233
and I was feeling
a little creeped out,

27:30.233 --> 27:31.667
and I thought,

27:31.667 --> 27:35.600
"Well, if somebody's up here,
then just let me know.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.100
Just open that knee wall door."

27:37.100 --> 27:39.333
And then the knee
wall door opened.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.633
What did you think
when that happened?

27:40.633 --> 27:44.567
Well, at first, I thought,
"Okay, um..."

27:44.567 --> 27:47.233
Feeling a little creeped out.
Right.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.267
The fact that Vicki
experienced something paranormal

27:49.267 --> 27:53.067
could suggest that the activity
is tied to the property.

27:53.067 --> 27:56.933
So, Wayne made a walkway
with that slate over there,

27:56.933 --> 27:58.200
and then...

27:58.200 --> 28:01.067
But he noticed this one,
and so they moved it over.

28:01.067 --> 28:03.400
They had no idea
why it was here.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.800
It's nice to have the back story

28:04.800 --> 28:07.367
because I think they were
wondering where it came from.

28:07.367 --> 28:09.100
So, as a previous owner
of this house,

28:09.100 --> 28:11.333
do you know anything
about this stone?

28:11.333 --> 28:14.167
Yes.

28:14.167 --> 28:15.733
I brought the stone here.

28:34.767 --> 28:36.500
So, as a previous owner
of this house,

28:36.500 --> 28:38.833
do you know anything
about this stone?

28:38.833 --> 28:41.633
Yes.

28:41.633 --> 28:43.400
I brought the stone here.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.933
What's the story?

28:46.933 --> 28:49.933
Okay, the story is
is that I had a beagle

28:49.933 --> 28:51.167
that was living here
at the time,

28:51.167 --> 28:53.100
and as you can see,
there's other...

28:53.100 --> 28:54.600
The fence is high.
Yeah.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.067
So, she was digging out,

28:56.067 --> 28:59.300
and I had run out
of available material

28:59.300 --> 29:01.100
in my yard
and surrounding yards,

29:01.100 --> 29:02.567
so I went out on a hunt,

29:02.567 --> 29:05.067
and right next to the high
school, there's a cemetery.

29:05.067 --> 29:08.900
So, I went to the lot that
the maintenance people use

29:08.900 --> 29:10.567
and there was a pile of rubble,

29:10.567 --> 29:12.867
and that happened to be
in the pile of rubble.

29:12.867 --> 29:15.367
- Okay.
- Geez.

29:15.367 --> 29:16.933
What kind of rubble was it?

29:16.933 --> 29:21.867
It was busted-up, like,
concrete and just rocks.

29:21.867 --> 29:23.967
It was like
a big debris pile.

29:23.967 --> 29:25.833
I thought,
"That's pretty disrespectful,"

29:25.833 --> 29:28.100
so I brought it here.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.600
That doesn't seem
out of the ordinary.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.067
Like, you're gonna go
find big stones,

29:31.067 --> 29:32.300
and you're gonna bring...
Mmhmm.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.433
You're gonna keep your dog
from escaping.

29:34.433 --> 29:36.300
Do you know what year
you did that?

29:36.300 --> 29:38.100
It would be around '97.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.067
- So, 1997?
- Mm-hmm.

29:40.067 --> 29:42.833
I moved out in 2007.

29:42.833 --> 29:46.267
Do you think it's possible that
me bringing this stone here,

29:46.267 --> 29:48.233
there was some attachment
to the stone?

29:48.233 --> 29:49.900
I mean...
We don't know yet.

29:49.900 --> 29:52.133
We just needed to get all the
background information on this

29:52.133 --> 29:54.067
and why it's here
and is it related to you

29:54.067 --> 29:56.467
so that we can use it
when we investigate the house.

30:07.867 --> 30:11.133
Would you rather do it in the
living room or in Macy's room?

30:11.133 --> 30:12.967
I think Macy's room
to begin with,

30:12.967 --> 30:14.333
and we'll bring
everything we have.

30:14.333 --> 30:17.867
Recorder, like,

30:17.867 --> 30:20.200
all of our recorders.
Awesome.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.967
I'll grab this guy.

30:22.967 --> 30:26.667
Let me grab
the spirit box.

30:26.667 --> 30:29.733
We're headed upstairs to
conduct a spirit-box experiment.

30:29.733 --> 30:32.033
We're not sure if the man
is Hollis Corbett,

30:32.033 --> 30:34.400
but he's the next
name on our list.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.567
So, Mr. Corbett,
what we're gonna do is.

30:36.567 --> 30:40.200
Ms. Bruni in there
is going to listen

30:40.200 --> 30:43.300
to that device
that she's holding.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.600
It's a radio.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.233
And sometimes
if you speak loud enough,

30:48.233 --> 30:49.600
you can talk through that device

30:49.600 --> 30:53.367
and she'll be able to hear
what you're saying.

30:53.367 --> 30:56.867
So, if you could
do me a favor...

30:56.867 --> 31:00.400
And speak to her

31:00.400 --> 31:03.533
and let her answer for you.

31:03.533 --> 31:07.300
Ready.

31:07.300 --> 31:11.600
Hollis Corbett,
are you here?

31:13.833 --> 31:15.700
Do you know who Vicki is?

31:18.500 --> 31:21.200
Do you have a message
for this family?

31:21.200 --> 31:23.600
"Marriage."

31:26.600 --> 31:29.067
What would you like to say
about marriage?

31:32.067 --> 31:34.533
"Two years."

31:41.300 --> 31:45.433
What branch in the military
were you in, Mr. Corbett?

31:47.833 --> 31:50.200
Did you have
any kind of injuries?

31:50.200 --> 31:51.833
Sir, where were you injured?

31:56.067 --> 31:58.267
Do you like Macy?

32:02.367 --> 32:03.633
Any of that
make any sense?

32:03.633 --> 32:05.300
I said, "Do you have
a message for this family?"

32:05.300 --> 32:06.667
And you said, "Marriage."

32:06.667 --> 32:08.633
And then you said "Two years,"
like, right after.

32:08.633 --> 32:10.200
Yeah.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.733
It's so weird.

32:12.733 --> 32:16.333
What is "two", though?
"Two years"? Marriage?

32:16.333 --> 32:18.333
I don't know.
I have to look.

32:18.333 --> 32:21.233
We'll figure it out.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.967
Someone's interacting with us,

32:22.967 --> 32:24.967
but we don't have
enough evidence to prove

32:24.967 --> 32:27.500
whether it's Hollis,
Delanne's brother,

32:27.500 --> 32:29.667
or the murderer Joseph Kelley.

32:29.667 --> 32:32.467
Macy made this beautiful
drawing for us today.

32:32.467 --> 32:35.300
Whatever is here seems
to know her and like her,

32:35.300 --> 32:40.533
so I'm gonna use this
as a trigger object.

32:40.533 --> 32:43.067
Here we go.

32:45.233 --> 32:48.700
So, if anything touches
this paper or gets near it,

32:48.700 --> 32:51.933
this alarm is gonna sound.

32:51.933 --> 32:53.667
Okay.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.067
All right.

32:55.067 --> 32:59.433
So, for anyone joining us
in the house tonight,

32:59.433 --> 33:03.167
Delanne, Wayne, and the kids
all invited us here

33:03.167 --> 33:04.667
to try to talk to you.

33:08.633 --> 33:12.467
We're wondering if
you want to talk to us.

33:12.467 --> 33:17.833
We have this gray device here,
and if you touch it,

33:17.833 --> 33:19.533
those lights will light up.

33:19.533 --> 33:22.600
Can you try to... okay.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.800
It did light up.
Mmhmm.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.133
Is someone
in here with us?

33:32.867 --> 33:37.533
This thing I'm holding,
it can see you, even if I can't.

33:40.533 --> 33:44.333
We just want
to talk to you.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.900
Oh.

33:49.133 --> 33:51.067
What?

33:51.067 --> 33:52.733
I think
I'm getting something.

33:52.733 --> 33:55.333
It just hid behind...

33:55.333 --> 33:57.867
That, I believe.

34:01.067 --> 34:03.300
There it is.

34:03.300 --> 34:04.600
It's right
in that corner.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.467
Standing over there?

34:06.467 --> 34:08.233
Standing on
that chair.

34:08.233 --> 34:09.967
Yeah.

34:09.967 --> 34:12.132
You can...
We can see you there.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.632
What's your name?

34:19.733 --> 34:22.199
Dan, are you here?

34:23.933 --> 34:26.100
Have you been
watching Macy?

34:26.100 --> 34:27.733
If it's you,
can you touch her paper

34:27.733 --> 34:29.733
so we know and set
that alarm off?

34:33.233 --> 34:36.067
Joseph Kelley,
are you here?

34:37.600 --> 34:39.400
Mr. Corbett, are you here?

34:44.067 --> 34:45.766
Oh, I lost him.

34:48.167 --> 34:49.833
- Is this the mic to the display?
- Yeah.

35:11.333 --> 35:13.333
That was loud.

35:13.333 --> 35:14.900
The only name that
it responded to...

35:14.900 --> 35:16.133
Hollis Corbett.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.233
That was loud.

35:46.233 --> 35:47.833
The only name that
it responded to...

35:47.833 --> 35:49.067
Hollis Corbett.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.067
It's the only name.

35:54.067 --> 35:56.633
Kind of makes sense because
she said that she got the vibe

35:56.633 --> 35:59.267
that he was dressed in kind of
'40s style clothing.

35:59.267 --> 36:00.500
'40s clothes!

36:00.500 --> 36:02.100
Did it give you
a time period?

36:02.100 --> 36:04.900
I would say, like, 1940s.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.833
- Okay.
- Clothing style.

36:06.833 --> 36:10.167
He died in 1946.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.067
Mr. Corbett,
if you're here,

36:12.067 --> 36:14.800
it's very important
that you speak with us.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.067
I was looking through
some records,

36:18.067 --> 36:23.067
and I saw that you had a young
daughter named Barbara.

36:23.067 --> 36:26.067
Does Macy remind you
of Barbara?

36:28.200 --> 36:30.067
We know that there is
something in the backyard

36:30.067 --> 36:31.400
that belongs to you.

36:31.400 --> 36:36.367
Are you upset that it's here
and not at your grave?

36:36.367 --> 36:38.500
Is your name
Hollis Corbett?

36:42.433 --> 36:45.067
Did you die
when you were 49?

36:48.933 --> 36:53.067
You don't owe us anything,
but you owe the family,

36:53.067 --> 36:56.433
'cause they are
scared to death.

36:56.433 --> 36:58.833
We're gonna try to do
everything we can

36:58.833 --> 37:03.833
to get your headstone
back to where it belongs.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.400
Wait,
did it say "Corbett"?

37:24.067 --> 37:25.567
"Corbett."

37:30.067 --> 37:31.633
"48"!

37:31.633 --> 37:33.567
Did he die when he was 48?
I don't know.

37:33.567 --> 37:36.333
I'll do the math
in a minute.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.333
"48."

37:42.333 --> 37:44.967
<i>We're gonna try to do
everything we can</i>

37:44.967 --> 37:48.567
<i>to get your headstone
back to where it belongs.</i>

37:50.933 --> 37:52.800
Brought up the picture,
and he was 48.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.533
- Oh!
- He was 48.

37:55.533 --> 37:56.700
He corrected us.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.533
He was 48, not 49.

37:58.533 --> 37:59.567
I mean...

37:59.567 --> 38:01.733
I can't believe
he corrected us.

38:01.733 --> 38:05.233
No,
he's a staunch war hero.

38:05.233 --> 38:06.767
He's like, "I'm 48."

38:06.767 --> 38:08.300
- 48.
- Like, well, sorry.

38:08.300 --> 38:09.600
I don't know.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.067
I'm ready to talk to these guys
and let them know.

38:12.067 --> 38:14.633
Yep. There's a lot that
we need to tell them.

38:22.533 --> 38:25.600
So, first of all,
the issue of the choking,

38:25.600 --> 38:27.767
which was the most
concerning activity

38:27.767 --> 38:29.067
I think that you guys

38:29.067 --> 38:30.500
experienced in the house
for your boys.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.700
Delanne: Right. Yeah.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.733
So, just, take a listen,
and we'll explain.

38:33.733 --> 38:36.133
<i>Are you choking them?</i>

38:36.133 --> 38:37.333
- Do you hear that?
- I do.

38:37.333 --> 38:39.967
You even hear the "no"
that comes out of it.

38:39.967 --> 38:41.333
- Oh. You can hear the...
- Right.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.433
- Like it's a voice. "No."
- "No."

38:43.433 --> 38:44.833
That was
a very emphatic "no."

38:44.833 --> 38:47.067
Right, and considering
how much time we spent here

38:47.067 --> 38:48.400
investigating,

38:48.400 --> 38:50.167
if there was something
dark or violent,

38:50.167 --> 38:51.600
we'd have noticed.

38:51.600 --> 38:55.500
I had a lengthy video chat
with a clinical psychologist

38:55.500 --> 38:59.100
who specializes
in sleep disruptions.

38:59.100 --> 39:02.067
It's possible that
your older son and Feyd

39:02.067 --> 39:05.067
both experienced some sort
of sleep paralysis

39:05.067 --> 39:06.300
and hallucination.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.567
Right.

39:07.567 --> 39:10.067
The typical onset for that
is your teenage years.

39:10.067 --> 39:11.933
- Yes.
- They can hallucinate.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.133
- Yes.
- It can feel like hands.

39:14.133 --> 39:17.333
- Mm-hmm.
- If it keeps happening for Feyd,

39:17.333 --> 39:19.300
I would take him to get
a sleep study done.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.100
Right.
Yeah, absolutely.

39:21.100 --> 39:24.967
We found no evidence of anything
pertaining to your family.

39:24.967 --> 39:27.300
- Right.
- Really? That's surprising.

39:27.300 --> 39:30.933
As we investigated, the only
thing that got any response

39:30.933 --> 39:34.567
was when we talked
about Hollis Corbett.

39:34.567 --> 39:36.533
Which is...
Interesting.

39:36.533 --> 39:38.533
- ...the gravestone in your yard.
- Right.

39:38.533 --> 39:39.633
Yes.

39:39.633 --> 39:42.633
<i>Mr. Corbett, are you here?</i>

39:42.633 --> 39:44.700
"Yes."

39:44.700 --> 39:48.100
The next one is Amy and I were
investigating up in Macy's room.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.633
Tell us
what you think it says.

39:49.633 --> 39:52.367
<i>What the names are of
the children in this house?</i>

39:52.367 --> 39:54.800
"Macy."
it said, "Macy."

39:54.800 --> 39:56.200
- Mm-hmm.
- That was...

39:56.200 --> 39:57.467
That said "Macy."
Mmhmm.

39:57.467 --> 39:58.800
Yeah.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.500
Just to give you an idea
of why we think it says "Macy,"

40:01.500 --> 40:04.000
as I did research in
to Hollis Corbett,

40:04.000 --> 40:08.400
we found out that he had had a
daughter in 1938 named Barbara,

40:08.400 --> 40:10.733
and she passed away
at a young age.

40:10.733 --> 40:12.667
And so,
that would explain

40:12.667 --> 40:14.800
why he would take
an interest in Macy.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.233
She's a sweet, little girl.
Right.

40:16.233 --> 40:18.567
And so, he was probably
trying to interact with her.

40:18.567 --> 40:19.733
Wow.

40:19.733 --> 40:21.133
Which could probably
come off as scary to her.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.400
- It makes sense.
- Right, and we don't think

40:23.400 --> 40:25.200
Hollis is here to do
any harm to anyone.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.567
- Right.
- Let's just put that out there.

40:26.567 --> 40:27.867
Okay.

40:27.867 --> 40:30.133
The last EVP that we wanted
to play for you is...

40:30.133 --> 40:34.033
<i>Did you die when you were 49?</i>

40:34.033 --> 40:35.867
There's that pause
like, "48."

40:35.867 --> 40:37.200
Yes.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.433
What's crazy is
I immediately am like,

40:38.433 --> 40:39.533
"Wait a minute.
Let me look."

40:39.533 --> 40:42.500
And I bring up the photo
of his headstone,

40:42.500 --> 40:45.233
and we've been saying 49 'cause
we just subtracted the year,

40:45.233 --> 40:46.833
but he had not turned 49 yet.

40:46.833 --> 40:48.267
He was 48.
Uhhuh.

40:48.267 --> 40:50.433
He was correcting us.

40:50.433 --> 40:52.433
We also caught some evidence
using the spirit box,

40:52.433 --> 40:53.467
but we don't know
what it means.

40:53.467 --> 40:57.200
It said "marriage"
and "two years."

40:57.200 --> 40:59.000
"Two years" is
a question Mark for us.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.100
We don't know
if it relates.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.967
We got legally married
two years ago.

41:03.967 --> 41:06.967
- Really?
- In the backyard.

41:06.967 --> 41:09.267
Our marriage... we've been
together 15, but we...

41:09.267 --> 41:11.900
Our marriage was two years ago
in the backyard.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.367
He probably watched
you guys get married.

41:14.367 --> 41:15.667
That would be really cool.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.433
I guess what it boils
down to is why is

41:17.433 --> 41:21.067
Hollis attached
to this headstone, right?

41:21.067 --> 41:23.767
I was able to find
his actual grave,

41:23.767 --> 41:26.300
and now you can look
at his actual gravestone.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.700
Which is not correct.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.500
It's spelled "Hollie B. Corbett"
with an "E"

41:30.500 --> 41:32.200
and not an "S."

41:32.200 --> 41:34.467
So, even though his nickname
might've been "Hollie,"

41:34.467 --> 41:36.333
we had found the order form
for the tombstone,

41:36.333 --> 41:39.100
and the family requested
his name be "Hollis."

41:39.100 --> 41:40.800
- Oh, my.
- So, the one that's there...

41:40.800 --> 41:42.533
we have the correct one.

41:42.533 --> 41:48.567
Yeah, he... it's interesting
because we talked to Vicki.

41:48.567 --> 41:51.133
Vicki was
the previous homeowner.

41:51.133 --> 41:54.300
And she is the one
who got that headstone,

41:54.300 --> 41:56.933
and then you dug it up
shortly after you guys moved in.

41:56.933 --> 41:58.267
- Wow.
- Yeah.

41:58.267 --> 41:59.533
That is quite the tale.

41:59.533 --> 42:01.700
Maybe Hollis had faith

42:01.700 --> 42:03.600
that Vicki would
do something with it,

42:03.600 --> 42:06.400
and now that Vicki's gone,
"Vicki, Vicki, Vicki"...

42:06.400 --> 42:09.100
- Right.
- And why is this tombstone here?

42:09.100 --> 42:12.600
Now nobody knows that
it's the correct one

42:12.600 --> 42:14.800
because Vicki's gone.
Right.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.267
It's a great opportunity
for you guys

42:17.267 --> 42:19.733
to kind of correct
the wrong here.

42:19.733 --> 42:21.067
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

42:21.067 --> 42:23.500
I feel excited to do
the right thing for Hollis.

42:23.500 --> 42:27.267
I really feel like that is the
proper resolution to this case.

42:27.267 --> 42:29.733
Like that's case closed.
Mmhmm.

42:36.467 --> 42:39.267
There he is.

42:39.267 --> 42:41.433
Hollis, I know you've been
trying to communicate,

42:41.433 --> 42:44.133
and I never knew until
now what you wanted.

42:44.133 --> 42:46.600
Sure that it happens for you.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.833
I'm gonna make sure that your
stone gets where it belongs.

42:49.833 --> 42:52.600
Gonna take good care of you.
