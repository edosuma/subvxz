23:02.766 --> 23:07.294
It made me so crazy that
I told Sister everything.

23:07.868 --> 23:10.711
I didn't know
it would turn out like this.

23:12.976 --> 23:17.739
Mrs. Yun. Please do something about it. Okay?

23:17.739 --> 23:22.435
Your husband
and my son's father, they…

23:24.067 --> 23:28.802
They're both in the same boat, right?

23:28.802 --> 23:32.594
Mrs. Yun, please help me.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.908
Mrs. Yun, please.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.834
[STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT]

23:57.779 --> 24:01.628
Vice Chairman Jung will not be indicted.

24:01.628 --> 24:05.482
You'd better make sure of that.

24:05.482 --> 24:07.772
How you must feel,

24:07.772 --> 24:10.510
seeing your one and only sister

24:10.510 --> 24:13.725
lose everything she has
in one fell swoop.

24:13.725 --> 24:18.094
What will you do about Cho Gang-hyeon?

24:18.094 --> 24:22.577
First we'll publish a column
in the Hanju Daily,

24:22.577 --> 24:25.639
something affectionate and sympathetic.

24:25.639 --> 24:28.108
"Can we entrust prosecutorial reform

24:28.108 --> 24:32.780
to a man with deep personal sorrows?"

24:32.780 --> 24:34.846
Maybe it's because
you majored in literature,

24:34.846 --> 24:38.289
but you sure
have a way with words, Madam.

24:38.289 --> 24:41.314
Mr. Editor-in-chief, what do you think?

24:41.314 --> 24:46.267
Jung Jun-hyeok
would have to report on it.

24:46.267 --> 24:50.508
These days, if the broadcast news
doesn't get behind something…

24:50.508 --> 24:52.913
the papers alone won't get very far.

24:52.913 --> 24:58.463
We must know some police officers
who have connections with the press.

24:58.463 --> 25:00.300
Not like in the past, no.

25:00.300 --> 25:03.027
There's been a push to clean things up.

25:03.027 --> 25:08.491
People expect
the police to be clean, these days.

25:10.069 --> 25:13.899
They say it's for the public good.
What can you say to that?

25:15.169 --> 25:18.882
Assemblyman Min, please choose
another candidate for director.

25:18.882 --> 25:22.007
Once you've settled on a candidate,

25:22.007 --> 25:25.361
we'll support you
in whatever way you need.

25:25.361 --> 25:29.189
How will you
take responsibility for this?

25:29.189 --> 25:32.800
This all happened because
you couldn't keep your house in order.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.283
Women flying off the handle
seems to be a family tradition…

25:37.066 --> 25:40.624
She was so quiet growing up.
I don't understand what happened to her.

25:40.624 --> 25:43.877
Your family had nothing at all

25:43.877 --> 25:48.169
until you got your law degree with
the money from selling your sister.

25:48.169 --> 25:52.085
It paid your expenses
when you worked as a prosecutor.

25:52.863 --> 25:55.207
That's a surprising attitude from you

25:55.207 --> 25:57.901
who for 16 years had your way paid by us.

25:57.901 --> 25:59.489
What I'm saying is…

25:59.489 --> 26:04.294
Your younger daughter-in-law should be
called here for fairness's sake.

26:04.294 --> 26:09.389
So you wonder how I'll punish
Yoon Jae-hui, I see.

26:11.947 --> 26:14.885
She'll be disposed of.

26:14.885 --> 26:19.610
One doesn't keep
broken tools in the tool box.

26:44.427 --> 26:47.189
Please give this to Director Yun Jae-hui.

26:48.880 --> 26:52.046
I was sent to deliver it.
Sungjin Art Gallery.

27:41.386 --> 27:44.486
We couldn't find the shoes this time.

27:44.486 --> 27:47.364
He always relapses like this.

27:47.364 --> 27:51.196
Such a gentle man, why he'd act
like that when he sees women's shoes…

27:51.196 --> 27:55.291
But after you've come to see him,
he always improves for a time.

27:55.291 --> 27:57.157
He doesn't recognize me anyway.

27:57.157 --> 28:00.082
No, that's not true,
even if that's how it might feel.

28:00.082 --> 28:02.082
I appreciate the hard work.

28:02.082 --> 28:04.249
Make sure to treat all the staff, on me.

28:04.249 --> 28:07.510
You don't have to keep doing this.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.582
Thank you.

28:35.071 --> 28:38.297
Why? You like them?

28:39.660 --> 28:41.523
Yes.

28:42.667 --> 28:45.653
They're quite expensive.
You can't afford them.

28:45.653 --> 28:49.694
I'm a judge, you know.

28:53.046 --> 28:55.774
Not like the judges I know.

28:56.503 --> 28:58.305
You don't have any money.

28:58.305 --> 29:00.795
You put all your siblings through school

29:00.795 --> 29:04.710
and even paid for their weddings,
so of course you're poor.

29:06.416 --> 29:10.819
You already told me this.
Don't you remember?

29:10.819 --> 29:13.986
Oh, yes, right.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.684
Still.

29:16.684 --> 29:18.417
Your…

29:18.417 --> 29:21.907
Your shoes, would you tell me
how much they cost?

29:22.972 --> 29:26.682
Actually, I have a daughter.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.249
She's an art student
at the University of Korea.

29:29.249 --> 29:33.614
I want to buy her a pair for graduation.

29:34.221 --> 29:38.884
You know when she was in middle school,

29:38.884 --> 29:43.171
I promised to buy her
some brand name sneakers but never could.

29:43.171 --> 29:46.772
I still feel guilty about that.

29:49.152 --> 29:51.671
It's fine, don't buy anything.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.280
Shoes are just the beginning.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.169
Once she has shoes, then she'll
need a bag and clothes.

29:58.169 --> 30:01.892
You really have to dress nice
when you're selling art to rich people.

30:01.892 --> 30:04.563
Otherwise they say you have bad taste.

30:07.582 --> 30:10.088
Why not make a bunch of money yourself?

30:10.088 --> 30:11.563
You're a judge, right?

30:11.563 --> 30:15.983
Get wined and dined,
get some kickbacks, get promoted.

30:17.773 --> 30:19.636
No…

30:19.636 --> 30:23.872
You should have just married rich
after you passed the law exam.

30:23.872 --> 30:27.289
Then, these shoes
wouldn't seem so expensive.

30:27.289 --> 30:32.850
For such a pretty woman,
you sure say horrible things.

30:35.063 --> 30:38.375
Anyway, I'm a bit busy. I'll be going.

30:46.339 --> 30:49.096
Your father is a great man.

30:49.619 --> 30:54.238
A judge for 30 years
and yet he stayed clean.

30:54.238 --> 30:56.899
I appreciate the compliment.

30:57.525 --> 31:00.492
I hear your mother
went to a vocational school?

31:00.492 --> 31:04.617
She worked as a bank teller
while he sat for his exams, right?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.930
You must have learned a lot from her.

31:06.930 --> 31:10.664
You'll know to support your husband.

31:10.664 --> 31:13.788
You know Jun-hyeok
was illegitimate, right?

31:14.457 --> 31:17.389
You don't hear that word
very often these days.

31:17.389 --> 31:20.589
It's considered discriminatory.

31:20.589 --> 31:25.294
Right, and they call
unmarried mothers 'single' mothers.

31:25.294 --> 31:26.769
Right.

31:27.425 --> 31:30.594
Your soon-to-be father-in-law
was once my family's driver.

31:30.594 --> 31:33.150
I'm sure you've heard that.

31:33.150 --> 31:36.133
I know that Jun-il

31:37.480 --> 31:41.111
was born out of wedlock,

31:41.111 --> 31:45.852
and you were forced to marry
for the sake of your son's legitimacy.

31:46.657 --> 31:49.478
Let's call a spade a spade.

31:49.478 --> 31:52.250
I wasn't a single mother,
I was unmarried.

31:52.250 --> 31:56.266
I didn't choose it for myself.
It was just bad luck.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.491
If you're worried

32:06.491 --> 32:09.463
that for that reason I might
be disrespectful of you-

32:09.463 --> 32:11.256
Hey!

32:14.059 --> 32:17.022
You're a cheeky one, aren't you?

32:17.699 --> 32:21.028
I'm telling you this
so you understand your position.

32:21.028 --> 32:26.009
Don't make the mistake
of thinking you're one of us.

32:26.009 --> 32:28.660
You must never forget that.

32:28.660 --> 32:31.205
Your husband Jun-hyeok,

32:31.205 --> 32:36.608
he's the child of the driver
and some floozy.

32:36.608 --> 32:40.683
Still, because of Jun-hyeok,

32:40.683 --> 32:44.096
you were able to set foot in my house.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.688
Be thankful for that.

32:57.854 --> 33:00.267
Found not guilty, ma'am.

33:06.550 --> 33:10.244
Your father worried
a lot about your dowry.

33:10.244 --> 33:12.688
He helped us out today.

33:12.688 --> 33:16.492
All parents have
a soft spot for their children.

33:17.466 --> 33:22.591
Tell him I said he made a wise choice.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.782
A word, sir.

33:32.782 --> 33:35.894
How are you feeling about the verdict?

33:46.478 --> 33:49.258
It's not the life you're used to,

33:49.258 --> 33:52.185
so you'll find it uncomfortable.

33:52.941 --> 33:57.169
Don't overthink it.
Just keep one thought in mind.

33:58.392 --> 34:01.588
Be useful to us.

34:01.588 --> 34:03.499
If you're useful,

34:03.499 --> 34:08.233
I'll see you never want for anything…

34:11.158 --> 34:13.491
Integrity above all, right?

34:13.491 --> 34:16.777
But you gave our relatives
everything we had,

34:16.777 --> 34:18.896
leaving Mom to struggle.

34:18.896 --> 34:21.708
You were always so worried
about tarnishing your name,

34:21.708 --> 34:26.283
you wouldn't even let her haggle
for lower prices at the market.

34:26.283 --> 34:30.763
You couldn't even afford
to send me to a cram school.

34:30.763 --> 34:34.474
So why? Why are you doing this?

34:34.474 --> 34:36.591
How do you think I got here?

34:36.591 --> 34:38.907
Do you know how long
I struggled already?

34:38.907 --> 34:40.962
So…

34:43.359 --> 34:46.069
Isn't that the reason?

34:48.391 --> 34:52.815
I'm trying to repay that debt.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.714
I know it's late,

34:57.331 --> 35:00.991
but I wanted to repay
at least a tiny bit of that debt.

35:26.946 --> 35:29.669
Pass, pass!

35:33.301 --> 35:36.401
Down the middle!

35:36.401 --> 35:39.842
- Nice!
- Good one!

35:40.687 --> 35:42.840
Nice!

35:46.877 --> 35:48.140
Where's Hyeon-wu?

35:48.140 --> 35:52.197
He's about to finish his violin lesson.

35:52.197 --> 35:53.989
Mommy!

35:53.989 --> 35:56.561
Don't run.

35:58.674 --> 36:01.988
Why are you so late?

36:01.988 --> 36:05.772
I know, right?
Mommy missed Hyeon-wu.

36:05.772 --> 36:08.599
- Where's Daddy?
- I don't know.

36:08.599 --> 36:12.997
Every third weekend,
Mr. Jung goes to play basketball.

36:12.997 --> 36:14.892
Oh, you're right.

36:14.892 --> 36:16.925
Mom, can I play games?

36:16.925 --> 36:19.603
Hyeon-wu, I'm going now.
You should say goodbye.

36:19.603 --> 36:22.580
Bye-bye. Be sure to practice.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.513
How many times will you practice?

36:23.513 --> 36:24.541
A hundred times!

36:24.541 --> 36:26.704
A hundred times? Promise?

36:26.704 --> 36:28.649
Bye!

Please leave a message after the tone.

36:56.209 --> 36:57.872

36:57.872 --> 37:00.597
Mommy's in her room.

37:02.179 --> 37:03.750
Mommy, let's eat.

37:03.750 --> 37:06.222
"Dinner is ready."

37:13.874 --> 37:16.613
"Dinner is ready" sounds weird.

37:16.613 --> 37:18.355
Why?

37:18.355 --> 37:21.091
You're becoming a big boy, so
you'll have to use big boy words.

37:21.091 --> 37:24.057
It doesn't sound like
we love each other.

37:25.257 --> 37:28.871
Then you'll have to say it lovingly.

37:28.871 --> 37:31.593
Mommy and Daddy are like that.

37:31.593 --> 37:35.982
"Nah. 'Kay. Great." Then…

37:35.982 --> 37:39.119
"Yes. No. Fine."

37:39.119 --> 37:41.979
That's what you say
when you don't love someone.

[I'M RIGHT OUTSIDE]

37:54.677 --> 37:56.640
I saw someone leave your house.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.888
A young twenty-something.

37:59.783 --> 38:02.094
Ah, Kim Yi-seol?

38:02.094 --> 38:06.044
She's pretty, right? Young and fresh.

38:06.044 --> 38:08.144
Are you okay?

38:08.964 --> 38:11.752
You came all the way for this?

38:14.042 --> 38:17.188
Seeing as how there's little movement
from the hearing committee,

38:17.188 --> 38:19.708
it seems like
damage control is proceeding smoothly.

38:19.708 --> 38:23.643
Are you still secretly
investigating my husband?

38:25.055 --> 38:28.168
He's got another woman, right?

38:29.964 --> 38:33.927
Nothing will come of it. Don't worry.

38:34.881 --> 38:37.599
You must be happy.

38:37.599 --> 38:42.165
Take a good look at the asshole
you chose over me, right?

38:43.705 --> 38:46.446
Yeah, it's great.

38:46.446 --> 38:48.482
The fact that
I'm better than him.

38:49.113 --> 38:51.449
Serves you right.

38:53.954 --> 38:59.185
It's not like I didn't know
you were the better man.

38:59.185 --> 39:02.779
Diligent, kind and faithful.

39:03.477 --> 39:05.440
But…

39:05.440 --> 39:09.175
Jun-hyeok had what I needed.

39:09.175 --> 39:11.332
Sungjin Group…

39:11.332 --> 39:14.224
Jun-hyeok's protection.

39:14.224 --> 39:18.758
Born an illegitimate child,
he still ended up with a silver spoon

39:18.758 --> 39:22.386
and was given things
we can only dream of.

39:28.234 --> 39:30.768
Find someone for me.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.840
No Yeong-ju.

39:35.467 --> 39:39.094
It was the woman that set Madam Kwon off.

39:39.094 --> 39:41.769
I have to fix it
before it all blows up.

39:43.814 --> 39:48.252
Whatever happens,
I'll protect my husband.

39:48.252 --> 39:51.004
I need him.

39:52.679 --> 39:54.618
Hey, treat the boys to something nice.

39:54.618 --> 39:59.369
Thank you!
Food and drinks on Jun-hyeok tonight!

40:00.716 --> 40:02.097
You should come with us.

Of course.

41:08.725 --> 41:12.116
So, what do you want me
to do for you this time?

41:12.116 --> 41:15.780
I'll be here with you.
And this'll be the last time.

41:15.780 --> 41:19.038
You old art student types,

41:19.038 --> 41:22.569
you need to come work this job, not us.

01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:06.163
You've got quite a lot of spirit.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:09.133
No, I'm actually quite tired.

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:11.636
An upsetting thing has happened.

01:01:12.506 --> 01:01:14.991
Jun-hyeok's got another woman.

01:01:14.991 --> 01:01:19.569
It's not the first time.
I thought I'd get used to it

01:01:19.569 --> 01:01:20.802
but it hurts my pride.

01:01:20.831 --> 01:01:24.265
- Divorce would work.
- Hate that, too.

01:01:24.265 --> 01:01:27.337
No, I don't want that.
We won't do that.

01:01:27.337 --> 01:01:29.946
I guess I've realized,

01:01:29.946 --> 01:01:34.069
if you can't throw something out,
you've got to protect it.

01:01:35.554 --> 01:01:38.391
Looks like you're finally maturing.

01:01:38.391 --> 01:01:43.249
Ah, so it's happened to you, too.

01:01:44.248 --> 01:01:47.274
I failed to put myself
in your shoes after all.

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:49.287
But, Mother,

01:01:49.287 --> 01:01:51.887
I have finally understood.

01:01:51.887 --> 01:01:55.679
Unfortunately, I'm not quite
as desperate as you are.

01:01:55.679 --> 01:02:00.200
I don't have anything
so precious to protect.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.600
What is it that you want?

01:02:07.326 --> 01:02:09.401
Everything.

01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:11.452
Everything you have.

01:02:17.539 --> 01:02:20.085
You think you're capable of taking it?

01:02:20.962 --> 01:02:23.663
You'll have to help me.

01:02:23.663 --> 01:02:26.866
No one's just born ready.

01:02:26.866 --> 01:02:28.897
How can I trust that

01:02:28.897 --> 01:02:31.480
you have the best interests
of Jun-hyeok in mind?

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.350
If you're not interested in helping me,

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:38.358
Vice Chairman Jung Jun-il
will be arrested.

01:02:39.509 --> 01:02:42.179
I called in a favor from Cho Gang-hyeon.

01:02:43.162 --> 01:02:46.454
That and I'll reveal
all of his infidelities.

01:02:47.802 --> 01:02:50.485
If I'm going to lose it all anyway,

01:02:50.485 --> 01:02:53.060
then I guess I've got nothing to lose.

01:03:03.636 --> 01:03:05.586
So, what shall I do?

01:03:51.445 --> 01:03:56.567
[ARTIFICIAL CITY]

01:04:02.177 --> 01:04:11.237
Timing and subtitles by the... Team @Viki.com

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:17.960
So you think I was behind
Cho Gang-hyeon's wife's death.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.257
Cutting her off-

01:04:19.257 --> 01:04:23.204
Seon-mi, that's not how you raise a dog.

01:04:23.204 --> 01:04:25.118
Not satisfied with stealing scraps?

01:04:25.118 --> 01:04:27.966
I'm not stealing scraps,
I'm taking the whole thing.

01:04:27.966 --> 01:04:29.757
You stupid bitch.

01:04:29.757 --> 01:04:31.077
I need you, Kim Yi-seol.

01:04:31.077 --> 01:04:32.241
You have to go this far?

01:04:32.241 --> 01:04:35.390
A kid from an orphanage, how pitiful.

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:38.518
You know what, though? I'm more pitiful.

01:04:38.518 --> 01:04:41.155
I want to get along with you, Mother.

01:04:41.974 --> 01:04:42.653
What are you doing?

01:04:42.653 --> 01:04:45.991
You're just being greedy.

01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:47.612
Don't, Mother.

01:04:47.612 --> 01:04:50.694
I want to live well, just once.
