00:05.710 --> 00:07.710
Your mom thing,
that's so awesome.

00:07.710 --> 00:08.750
It is?

00:08.750 --> 00:10.170
Uh, we're gettin' away.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.750
We could have a party!

Gangway, everybody!

00:13.580 --> 00:15.750
(cheering)

00:15.750 --> 00:17.920
My friend thinks you're cute.
She wants to meet you.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.250
I'll introduce you.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.120
Bex! Bex! Bex! Bex!

00:22.120 --> 00:23.330
And what about
Andi's new dad?

We'd love to meet him, too.

life-altering blows she can handle.

00:29.380 --> 00:31.330
"Your dad doesn't
even know you exist."

00:31.330 --> 00:33.580
-He knows she exists.
-Who told him?

00:33.580 --> 00:34.750
I did.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.380
-Dad.
-Bex.

00:40.380 --> 00:41.290
-Dad!
-Bex...

Dad, you... you saw him,
you talked to him?

00:44.290 --> 00:45.460
You said, what?
What did you say?

00:45.460 --> 00:47.170
I didn't say anything.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.580
Andi!

00:49.580 --> 00:52.170
Look! It's Andi!

00:53.540 --> 00:56.330

if I could have the disco ball?

Oh, you mean right now?

01:06.460 --> 01:09.670
Tell you what, honey. We're gonna take
it down, and we'll bring it up to you.

01:09.670 --> 01:14.170
Or... you could take it down right
now, and I could bring it up to me.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.380
She's a cool mom.

03:05.380 --> 03:06.920
She lets you have parties.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.250
She makes me have parties.

03:09.250 --> 03:12.750
Don't get me wrong,
it was a great party...

03:12.750 --> 03:14.080
that I said we shouldn't have,

I won't do it again.

(laughs)

03:58.880 --> 04:00.250
You crack me up.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.750
Why are you so nervous
all the time?

04:01.750 --> 04:04.210
Uh, probably because both
my parents are shrinks.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.210
Oh, man, that...
that's rough.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.500
Please convey to Iris that I
enjoyed meeting her as well.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.880
Dude, I don't-- I don't
think you're following.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.880
They wanna hang out this weekend.
You cool with that?

05:27.880 --> 05:30.750
Yeah! Yeah, who wouldn't
be cool with that?

05:30.750 --> 05:33.500

Oh. Oh-- Just--

05:34.750 --> 05:36.750
Ha... You-- that was--

05:36.750 --> 05:38.380
I see what you
were goin' for there.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.580
You wanna...
You wanna try that again?

05:40.580 --> 05:42.170
-Nah, I'm good.
-Aah, okay.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.880
So, you're going
on a double date?

05:48.880 --> 05:52.500
It's not a date. It's a
hang, according to Jonah.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.420
What's the difference?

05:54.420 --> 05:56.540
I don't know. I was
hoping you could tell me.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.000
How would I know?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.920
I'm not allowed to date
until I graduate high school.

06:00.920 --> 06:04.380
Of course, with Bex in charge,
that rule's no longer in effect.

06:04.380 --> 06:06.380
Well, then,
that's good, right?

06:06.380 --> 06:08.420
I don't know. It turns out,
I like boundaries.

06:08.420 --> 06:12.040
I don't wanna get out there
and be bold and live life.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.000
I just wanna stay in my
room, and read a book.

06:19.330 --> 06:22.420
-So, what was it?
-What'd you do?

06:22.420 --> 06:25.040
You are not going
to believe this.

06:26.290 --> 06:28.420
I have to change my hair.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.580
What's wrong
with your hair?

06:30.580 --> 06:32.670
Ms. Dullridge said
it was too big.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.380
Apparently, somebody claimed
they failed a pop quiz

06:35.380 --> 06:38.170
because they couldn't see around
my hair to read the board.

06:38.170 --> 06:41.380
That is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

06:41.380 --> 06:44.920
I know! That's
what I told Ms. Dullridge.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.080
Using words that wouldn't
get me suspended.

06:49.580 --> 06:52.380
I just wish
I could talk to my mom.

06:52.380 --> 06:55.170
But she's
overseas still, right?

06:55.170 --> 06:57.620
Yeah, for at least
six more months.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.460
Well, you can't
change your hair.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.290
People know us as the group
with really good hair.

07:02.290 --> 07:04.540
I've never heard
anyone say that.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.540
I just started it,
spread it around.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.330
So what are
you gonna do?

07:09.330 --> 07:12.750
I don't know. But I have to
figure it out by tomorrow.

07:22.330 --> 07:23.250

07:27.880 --> 07:28.960
Andi?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.380
Andi!

07:38.380 --> 07:40.500
She's in her room reading.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.120
I just looked there.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.670
You didn't look hard enough.

07:51.790 --> 07:52.880
Hey, Shnoo.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.500
-Heh.
-What are you doing?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.960
Playing hide-and-seek.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.380
We've been doin' it for years.
I know all the spots.

08:01.380 --> 08:04.250
Hey, I was looking for you
to hang out.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.170
Didn't you hear me calling...

08:06.170 --> 08:07.330
you?

08:09.620 --> 08:11.710
Okay.

08:11.710 --> 08:13.330
Yeah, I get it.

08:13.330 --> 08:15.460
You did hear me.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.960
That's why you're hiding,
you're hiding from... me.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.620
That's silly.

08:25.620 --> 08:28.960
You don't wanna hang out, just
say, "I don't wanna hang out."

08:28.960 --> 08:31.120
I don't wanna hang out.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.289
See how easy that was?

08:36.539 --> 08:38.539
No... Bex.

08:45.330 --> 08:47.290

08:47.290 --> 08:48.380
No.

08:49.620 --> 08:53.040
I just miss
having a mom.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.290
And it's looking like
I'll never have a dad, either.

08:58.380 --> 09:01.960
Well, you still got me,
if that's good for anything.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.790

09:05.420 --> 09:07.210

-I-- Yes, but...

09:09.670 --> 09:13.750

Can we call him?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.460

I have a right to know?

It's bad?

12:23.710 --> 12:28.170
That's it?
After 13 years, "Hey"?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.540
That's outrageous.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.210
That's unforgivable.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.580
That's what I wrote him.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.500
-It is?
-Well, what would you say

12:35.500 --> 12:38.500
to someone right before
you blew up their whole life?

12:38.500 --> 12:41.460
If you wanna tell Bowie
he's a dad, have at it.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.670
Be my guest.

12:42.670 --> 12:43.960
Okay, I will.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.670
Fine.

12:45.670 --> 12:48.420
(keys clacking)

13:00.540 --> 13:03.210
Read to me
what you have so far.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.040
Bowie...

13:08.960 --> 13:09.960
Hey.

13:15.210 --> 13:17.710
Where's Buffy?
Why isn't she here?

13:17.710 --> 13:18.790
I don't know.

13:18.790 --> 13:20.460
But she always comes.

13:20.460 --> 13:21.880
Then she's coming.

13:21.880 --> 13:22.920
But I have to go.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.460
Then go,
you'll see her tomorrow.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.620
But I was supposed
to see her now.

13:26.620 --> 13:29.710
Okay, relax,
have a baby tater.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.920
Focus on me.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.380
Okay. I bought a new pair
of shoes for my double hang

13:34.380 --> 13:36.790
with Jonah tomorrow, and I need
to know what to wear with them.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.210
How would I know?

13:38.210 --> 13:40.380
I have visual aids.

13:40.380 --> 13:41.750
Okay.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.500
So. Khakis.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.080
Corduroys.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.790
Khakis, take your time.

13:47.790 --> 13:48.830
Corduroys.

13:48.830 --> 13:49.880
Khakis.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.790
Okay.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.500
Now.
Green khakis?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.580
-Or khaki khak--
-Khaki khakis.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.380
-Okay.
-I'm out.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.250
Okay, I-- I'll text you
my sock options.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.500
-Do that.
-Okay.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.750
Okay.

I just missed you.

14:44.830 --> 14:48.670
I'm really sorry. I didn't realize
Bex and I had been talking so long.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.290
It felt like five minutes.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.290
What were you talking about?

14:52.290 --> 14:55.380
I... don't even remember.

14:55.380 --> 14:57.500
Well, I remember

14:57.500 --> 14:59.290

15:03.290 --> 15:05.330
Aren't we going
to the flea market?

15:05.330 --> 15:08.120
I can't.
I have... homework.

15:08.120 --> 15:11.330
Well, then we won't stay long.
I just want some new supplies.

15:11.330 --> 15:14.580
Andi Shack is feeling way too
"been-there-beaded-that."

15:14.580 --> 15:16.830
You should stay
as long as you want,

15:16.830 --> 15:19.040
and find a lot of great stuff.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.710
And then, call me later, and tell
me about everything you got.

15:28.790 --> 15:31.210

15:39.120 --> 15:40.290
Cyrus?

15:40.290 --> 15:41.330
Iris?

15:41.330 --> 15:42.880
(both laugh)

15:42.880 --> 15:44.620

giggling about?

15:51.290 --> 15:52.710
Private joke.

15:54.290 --> 15:57.210
I love it, you're already
such a cute couple.

15:57.210 --> 15:59.380
So, games, food, rides?

15:59.380 --> 16:01.170
What are we doin' first?

16:01.170 --> 16:03.790
I'm not fussy.
Well, I'm a little fussy.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.210
Me too!

16:06.830 --> 16:08.000

17:09.210 --> 17:12.210
I probably shouldn't. I don't
do well with up and down.

17:12.210 --> 17:13.579
Or side to side.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.329
Or round and round.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.829
I need to get off.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
Seriously, who do I talk to?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.210
Are you okay?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.119
Stop the ride!

17:28.119 --> 17:29.620
Please!

17:29.620 --> 17:32.080
Please, stop the ride!
It's an emergency!

17:32.080 --> 17:33.790
Please!

17:33.790 --> 17:36.170
Please, I beg of you,
stop the ride!

17:36.170 --> 17:38.250
(retching)

17:38.250 --> 17:40.710
Cyrus, it stopped.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.750
He's not
going to make it.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.040
(retching)

18:14.580 --> 18:15.580
Okay.

18:19.210 --> 18:21.710
Hello! Is anyone home?

18:31.380 --> 18:33.540
What's going on?

18:33.540 --> 18:36.170
I'll tell you later.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.580
I wanna know now.

18:38.580 --> 18:41.460
You couldn't spend the day
with me...

18:41.460 --> 18:43.830
because you were spending it
with her?

18:45.330 --> 18:48.040
And when I don't wanna
hang out with you,

18:48.040 --> 18:51.040
you're just gonna
move on to my friends?

18:51.040 --> 18:53.290
Andi!

18:53.290 --> 18:57.880
(sighs)
This... is not about you.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.210
Not everything is.

19:05.330 --> 19:07.750
I'll give you two
a chance to talk.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.670
I didn't tell you everything that's
been going on with me and my hair.

19:19.670 --> 19:21.170
Like what?

19:22.330 --> 19:23.330
Like...

19:26.290 --> 19:30.330
I gave myself a bald spot.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.540
What?

19:32.540 --> 19:34.250
I burned my hair.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.580
And some fell off.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.670
Why didn't you tell me?

19:38.670 --> 19:40.250
I was embarrassed.

19:42.170 --> 19:43.830
Now, I'm embarrassed.

19:46.330 --> 19:48.710
That was so selfish,
what I said.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.330
You didn't know.

19:54.620 --> 19:58.120
So, tell me now.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.710
I flat-ironed my hair,
and I overdid it.

20:00.710 --> 20:04.580
I couldn't talk to my mom,
and you weren't using yours.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.920
But I would have been here
with you!

20:08.330 --> 20:10.380
I wish I'd been here.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.920
You wanted to go
to the flea market.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.880
You know you're more important
than the flea market!

20:19.540 --> 20:21.880
Well, you better know that.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.460
I liked having straight hair.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
I like having curly hair.

20:31.460 --> 20:35.040
I like being able to change it
whenever I want,

20:35.040 --> 20:37.670
not when someone else
tells me I have to.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.000
Like Dullridge? What are
you gonna do about her?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.120
It doesn't matter.
Curly hair, don't care.

20:50.830 --> 20:56.290
Oh, it is a story that Iris's grandchildren
will tell their grandchildren.

20:56.290 --> 20:57.460
It will never die.

20:57.460 --> 21:00.210
And the most painful
part is, that's over.

21:00.210 --> 21:01.670
He'll never speak
to me again.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.330
Hey, Cyrus!

21:03.330 --> 21:04.620
Hey, Jonah!

21:04.620 --> 21:06.000
See?

21:08.960 --> 21:10.830
So, what happened?

21:10.830 --> 21:14.580
Turns out, the people who
were distracted by my hair...

21:14.580 --> 21:16.210
just Jacob Szabo.

21:16.210 --> 21:18.380
Who doesn't even
sit behind me.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.830
Jacob Szabo?
That kid lies about everything.

21:21.830 --> 21:23.420
Apparently, in another class,

21:23.420 --> 21:27.250
he said he failed a test because he
was overwhelmed by dry-erase fumes.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.670
They should've
sent him home, not you.

21:30.670 --> 21:34.120
His mom is the something-something
of the school district,

21:34.120 --> 21:38.330
and she made a stink. But now
Jacob the Liar's suspended,

21:38.330 --> 21:42.290
and I got a personal apology
from the principal.

21:42.290 --> 21:45.380
And so ends another adventure
of the Good Hair Crew.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.170
We're not the Good Hair Crew.

21:47.170 --> 21:48.920
Yes, we are.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.420
The T-shirts
have been ordered.

21:50.420 --> 21:53.250
-(both laughing)
-Oh my gosh.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.330
Bex!

22:02.250 --> 22:03.120
Bex!

22:05.500 --> 22:06.670
(clearing throat)

22:13.830 --> 22:15.330
(laughing)

22:20.540 --> 22:22.670
Thank you for helping my friend.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.380
-Cookie?
-Mm-hm.

22:30.750 --> 22:34.120
-Aw, I only got half an animal.
-(laughing)

22:34.120 --> 22:36.080
-I got the other half.
-(both laughing)

22:41.380 --> 22:43.750
So you have to look
where you want it to go...

22:43.750 --> 22:47.000
-Okay. -...and then use
your wrist so that it's...

22:49.580 --> 22:50.710
Sorry.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.250
Oh my gosh.

22:54.250 --> 22:57.120
At least let me finish
the instruction!

23:24.960 --> 23:26.040
Andi:
 Next, on Andi Mack...

23:26.040 --> 23:29.000
I saw Amber in the park
with someone else.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.290
You're the fastest girl.

23:30.290 --> 23:31.290
Meaning what?

23:31.290 --> 23:32.540
There's a faster boy?

23:32.540 --> 23:33.620
-Yep.
-Who?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.620
Hi, Marty from the party,
nice to meet you.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.420
-Hey! -Amber Alert! Amber Alert!

23:43.420 --> 23:45.170
I had to show Jonah
why you were lying.

23:45.170 --> 23:47.040
Andi, I-- I feel really bad.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.790
Do you really think
that I lied to you?

23:49.790 --> 23:51.080
Just go.
