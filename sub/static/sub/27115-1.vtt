17:54.400 --> 17:55.533
"Calm down."

17:57.333 --> 17:59.233

48 hours now. It's like--

17:59.266 --> 18:02.500
- He needs to tell people.
He wants to tell people so bad.

18:02.533 --> 18:04.700
- Nobody in the world knows
that I'm proposing.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.667
Well, except for Tom and Tom.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.000
Now, Stassi and Beau,

18:09.033 --> 18:12.600
and maybe a hot dog vendor
and my Uber driver.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.367
I guess the only person
I'm really worried about

18:14.400 --> 18:16.600
blowing this secret is me,

18:16.633 --> 18:19.300
and maybe the hot dog vendor.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.266
- Wait, oh, my God.
I'm going to the dog park

18:21.300 --> 18:23.633

I don't--I'm gonna throw--

18:23.667 --> 18:25.700

18:25.734 --> 18:27.433
Don't say anything.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.467
- Don't do any winky, winky.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.767
- Yeah, don't say anything.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.667
- Congratulations, seriously.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.000
- Congratulations to you too.
Congratulations to you too.

18:35.033 --> 18:37.467
- You know, Jax,
if you would have told me this

18:37.500 --> 18:40.633
eight months ago,
all of us would have said,

18:40.667 --> 18:43.567
"Hell no, you don't
deserve Brittany."

18:43.600 --> 18:45.300
I just don't know,
if you guys,

18:45.333 --> 18:46.533

18:46.567 --> 18:48.367
if I could, like,
attend the wedding.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.266
I don't think
I'd be capable of it.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.734

a giant change in you.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.200

you stoop so low

Rand was absolutely not okay
with it,

Pandora's a mixologist now.

26:20.066 --> 26:21.300

26:23.266 --> 26:24.767

26:25.000 --> 26:27.166
I hope there's not a part of
this that's coming

26:27.200 --> 26:28.500

you know,

26:28.533 --> 26:30.266

your dad passed away.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.700

26:31.734 --> 26:33.166
She--That's when I knew she was
the one.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.500

from my house,

26:51.533 --> 26:53.100
so it's super convenient.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.367

26:54.400 --> 26:56.200
Can you go pee pee?
Play.

26:56.233 --> 26:58.066
- I think he's like,

26:58.100 --> 26:59.367
"What is this ground?"
is this?"

26:59.400 --> 27:01.000
Okay, pups.
- Here, Kings.

27:01.033 --> 27:02.300
Oh, my gosh,
he really doesn't know

27:02.333 --> 27:03.367
how to walk on there.
Do you see him?

27:03.400 --> 27:04.633
You can do it.

27:04.667 --> 27:06.400
- Refund just wants
to be chased.

27:06.433 --> 27:08.233
- Good girl.
You go pee pee.

27:08.266 --> 27:09.600
- Okay, wait, I can't.

27:09.633 --> 27:11.300
- So--well, you saw
Jax after work, didn't you?

27:11.333 --> 27:12.533
- Yeah.

27:12.567 --> 27:13.533
- What did you guys do
at Belmont?

27:13.567 --> 27:15.300
Anything fun?

27:18.300 --> 27:20.367
- Get drunk.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.100
- Yeah, pretty much.

27:23.133 --> 27:26.133
I am angry at Jax
for giving me the information

27:26.166 --> 27:27.500
that he is about to propose.

27:27.533 --> 27:31.033
Like, I'm sweating.
I'm sweating everywhere.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.200
- And Jax is, like,
I don't know.

27:33.233 --> 27:34.567
I hope everybody can tell,
like,

27:34.600 --> 27:36.500
how much of a change
that he's making.

27:36.533 --> 27:40.333
- I told him that, yes.
Yeah.

27:40.367 --> 27:43.600
- It's way better.
- Mm-hmm.

27:43.633 --> 27:46.500
- Like, I'm so much happier
this year than I was last year.

27:46.533 --> 27:48.266
- Yeah.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.667
Um...

27:50.700 --> 27:53.533
I'm so glad, Brittany,
'cause I legitimately thought

27:53.567 --> 27:55.266
you needed to get out of that.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.533
- Well, yeah.
- And I feel so much better.

27:57.567 --> 27:59.400
- I know, but, like, is it--
it's crazy,

27:59.433 --> 28:00.567
'cause, like,
I have just felt it

28:00.600 --> 28:04.200
that we're supposed
to be together.

28:04.233 --> 28:06.567
And then he finally
made the change.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.500
I feel like I'm gonna cry,
but it's like...

28:08.533 --> 28:11.200
- He's doing a lot better.
- I'm so excited for you.

28:14.066 --> 28:16.166
- I can't believe I cried over
saying that.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.300
- That's so sweet.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.066
- Kyle Chan.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.266
- Hey.
- Kyle Chan.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.133
- Hey.

28:26.166 --> 28:27.400
How are you?

28:27.433 --> 28:29.066
- This is the first time

28:29.100 --> 28:30.433
I'm actually gonna hold it
in my hand.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.633
- Usually takes at least
three beers for me to...

28:35.667 --> 28:37.300
- Usually happens to him
when he's hungover.

28:37.333 --> 28:38.633
- Yeah.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.400
- So I'm obviously getting
engaged tomorrow.

28:40.433 --> 28:41.400
- Holy sh--!

28:41.433 --> 28:42.700
Say that again!

28:42.734 --> 28:44.500
Say that one more time.
- Tomorrow night.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.467
So we're going to Malibu.
I'm going to Neptune's Net.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.567
I'm proposing tomorrow.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.066
- Jax had mentioned that he was
gonna be proposing soon,

28:51.100 --> 28:55.066
but I didn't realize
it was tomorrow.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.500
Obviously, Ariana and I
have been together

28:57.533 --> 29:00.233
for much longer
than Jax and Brittany,

29:00.266 --> 29:01.600
but it's not awkward that

29:01.633 --> 29:04.133
they're getting married
before us.

29:07.500 --> 29:10.200
- We're taking an Uber there,
and I got a limo waiting for us

29:10.233 --> 29:12.333
to take us back,
and then everybody--

29:12.367 --> 29:14.200
you guys are gonna be
at my house--surprise.

29:14.233 --> 29:15.633
Like, just--not everybody...
- So we're gonna set

29:15.667 --> 29:18.100
that sh-- up.
- But the--my close friends.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.300
- Should I go bring out
the ring?

29:19.333 --> 29:20.467
all: Yes.
- Let's see that sh--.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.633
- Okay, I'll be right back.

29:21.667 --> 29:23.200
- That thing's a beast,
by the way.

29:23.233 --> 29:24.533
- So I'm just gonna warn you.

29:24.567 --> 29:26.233
It's gonna be a little bigger
than usual,

29:26.266 --> 29:28.100
and you're gonna be, like,
"How the

29:28.133 --> 29:30.467
did you afford this?"
It's way out of my price range.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.734
When my father passed away,

29:31.767 --> 29:34.333
he left some more
for my sister and I,

29:34.367 --> 29:36.467
and I'm using my money
for the ring,

29:36.500 --> 29:38.400
and every time I look at it
I can think of my dad,

29:38.433 --> 29:41.433
and that's just another memory
for me, so...

29:41.467 --> 29:45.133
My father passed away
about six months ago,

29:45.166 --> 29:47.700
and it was kind of
a turning point for me.

29:47.734 --> 29:49.500
I told Brittany, like,
"I think I'm gonna go

29:49.533 --> 29:52.200
into a hole for a while.
I'm gonna drink myself silly."

29:52.233 --> 29:54.767
And she was just like, "Can you
just please not do that?"

29:55.000 --> 30:00.200
And she really helped me
make a huge turn around.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.233
- I hope there's not a part of
this is coming a little bit

30:02.266 --> 30:03.633
because of, like, you know,

30:03.667 --> 30:05.266
she was there when
your dad passed away.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.600
- Yeah, of course it does.

30:06.633 --> 30:08.200
She--that's when I knew
she was the one.

30:08.233 --> 30:09.667
Absolutely.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.633
The fact that after everything
she's been through,

30:11.667 --> 30:13.500
to stand up, grab my phone,
and say,

30:13.533 --> 30:15.300
"I'm gonna handle the flights,

30:15.333 --> 30:17.400
the flowers, whatever you need.
I got this, baby."

30:17.433 --> 30:19.600
And I was like,
"This is my soul mate."

30:19.633 --> 30:21.367
That's just, like,
how could I not

30:21.400 --> 30:23.300
want to spend the rest of my
life with somebody

30:23.333 --> 30:24.400
who wants to take care of me
like that?

30:24.433 --> 30:26.200
That's just amazing.

30:26.233 --> 30:28.633
- You guys were off and on
and all that stuff.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.367
- It was, like, for, like,
three months--

30:30.400 --> 30:32.233
three or four months
where he went to Florida

30:32.266 --> 30:34.000
for a little bit and I stayed
in Kentucky and everything,

30:34.033 --> 30:35.767
but I feel, like--

30:38.567 --> 30:41.400
But I--but I told him--
I told Jax that.

30:41.433 --> 30:42.767
- You have to be able to, like,
say what happened.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.400
- Yeah.

30:44.433 --> 30:46.400
When Jax and I were broken up,

30:46.433 --> 30:51.000
I ended up hanging out with my
ex and we did sleep together.

30:51.033 --> 30:54.667
Did you get to meet Aaron?
- I did. I did.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.500
I don't want to make anything
kind of weird or awkward.

30:56.533 --> 30:59.433
It's not the kind of guy
I am.

30:59.467 --> 31:01.467
- But I feel like that might
have been one of the things

31:01.500 --> 31:03.333
that pulled us back together,

31:03.367 --> 31:04.667
because I don't think that
Jax could stand

31:04.700 --> 31:07.000
the thought of me being
with someone else.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.266
I would never cheat on anybody,

31:09.300 --> 31:10.734
so I hope it never happens
to me again.

31:10.767 --> 31:12.667
That's for sure.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.333
- Yeah.

31:15.367 --> 31:17.433
- All right, let's see it.
- I can't imagine.

31:17.467 --> 31:18.667

31:20.467 --> 31:23.567
- Oh, my God.
- Wow. Holy sh--.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.567

diamonds on that thing?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.600
- That is absolutely beautiful.

31:29.633 --> 31:32.200
- This one's, uh, 3 carat 14.

31:32.233 --> 31:34.767
It's, like, normally,
like, around 70 grand.

31:37.367 --> 31:39.533
