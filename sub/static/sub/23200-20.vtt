03:34.713 --> 03:36.049
There goes one.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.933
It's beautiful.

03:40.978 --> 03:42.356
It was beautiful.

03:43.066 --> 03:45.572
How often did you say
that's been happening?

03:46.032 --> 03:50.166
Dr. Jaffe?

03:56.264 --> 04:00.106
I was asking, Dr. Jaffe,
how often has this been happening?

04:00.566 --> 04:03.030
The shower began almost 24 hours ago.

04:03.615 --> 04:06.747
First the meteors appeared
every half-minute or so.

04:07.457 --> 04:11.132
Now they're tapering off.
One every seven to ten minutes.

04:11.634 --> 04:14.182
Dr. Jaffe, you locked that door,
didn't you?

04:14.724 --> 04:15.852
Yes.

04:17.606 --> 04:18.692
Why?

04:19.319 --> 04:21.616
A meteor shower is the result
of an object...

04:21.699 --> 04:24.748
which enters
the earth's gravitational field...

04:25.083 --> 04:28.215
and disintegrates as it plummets
through our atmosphere.

04:28.508 --> 04:31.932
The fragments burn up with friction
and that's what we see.

04:34.647 --> 04:38.364
You locked the door
just to give me a science lesson, Doctor?

04:40.035 --> 04:44.127
I observed that object which caused
the particular shower you were watching.

04:44.253 --> 04:45.966
It looks like a pyramid.

04:46.216 --> 04:48.973
Technically, it's an
equilateral tetrahedron.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.563
A line drawn through its center...

04:51.646 --> 04:54.736
would have been
a little less than 1 meter long.

05:02.588 --> 05:05.262
- Who's there?
- Me, Doctor. Cameron.

05:15.953 --> 05:18.459
- You asked for coffee, remember?
- Thank you.

05:20.631 --> 05:21.926
Diana Prince...

05:22.678 --> 05:24.766
my assistant, Cameron Michaels.

05:24.975 --> 05:26.729
- Hello. Coffee?
- Thank you.

05:27.147 --> 05:28.274
Later.

05:29.820 --> 05:33.579
I made that sketch just hours before
the object broke apart...

05:33.662 --> 05:35.166
and started falling to earth.

05:35.249 --> 05:37.504
You mean you alerted the IADC...

05:37.671 --> 05:39.886
just because of some freak asteroid?

05:40.596 --> 05:42.183
It was no asteroid.

05:42.851 --> 05:45.148
It was perfectly symmetrical,
as you can see.

05:45.231 --> 05:48.030
- And smooth and flawless.
- Then it was a satellite?

05:48.363 --> 05:52.165
Of course it wasn't a satellite.
Did you hear me say it was orbiting?

05:52.248 --> 05:55.798
To be frank, Doctor, I haven't
heard you say anything definitive.

05:56.467 --> 06:00.016
I'm saying it is not an asteroid,
not a satellite...

06:00.225 --> 06:04.444
and that all its components
are falling to earth in one certain spot.

06:08.578 --> 06:11.920
Here. They're falling here in California.

06:12.295 --> 06:16.765
Exactly 117 degrees longitude,
36 degrees latitude.

06:17.265 --> 06:18.812
There's a town there.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.941
Crystal Lake.

06:21.777 --> 06:24.992
If any of the meteors had hit,
we would've heard about it.

06:33.721 --> 06:35.559
It was just a mouse, Doctor.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.402
Cameron, find it and kill it.

06:41.198 --> 06:42.450
Go on!

06:49.801 --> 06:51.764
The rest of what I know is in here.

06:51.848 --> 06:55.064
You've got to take it
and get to Crystal Lake immediately.

06:55.481 --> 06:58.698
- Don't open it again until you get there.
- Wait a minute, Doctor.

06:58.781 --> 07:02.415
I've been authorized to give you
direct orders, no questions asked.

07:02.498 --> 07:03.876
I know, but-

07:03.960 --> 07:07.385
I am hereby ordering you
to go to Crystal Lake.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.849
Be careful.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.650
All right.

07:14.861 --> 07:17.074
But what is it that I'm looking for?

07:17.743 --> 07:19.664
You'll know when you find it.

08:03.309 --> 08:05.565
Remember, Miss Prince, be careful.

08:06.024 --> 08:09.031
Of course, Doctor.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Michaels.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.928
Hey, Mr. Pearson!

09:51.259 --> 09:53.135
- Hi, Skip.
- Hi, Pete.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.762
- You're looking very calm and cool.
- Why not?

09:56.095 --> 10:00.014
In exactly seven minutes, you're gonna
walk into a surprise algebra test.

10:00.472 --> 10:01.558
What?

10:01.641 --> 10:03.892
Slide rule Slim's
got that chalkboard covered up.

10:03.976 --> 10:05.018
You know what that means.

10:05.102 --> 10:08.021
- Yeah. Means I gotta borrow your notes.
- So what else is new?

10:08.105 --> 10:09.314
Thanks, buddy.

10:09.397 --> 10:11.440
Think he'll grade it straight or on a curve?

10:11.524 --> 10:13.525
- Straight.
- Seven out of ten's passing?

10:13.609 --> 10:16.318
- Seven right.
- I'll have it wired by test time.

10:17.027 --> 10:19.571
- Spoken like a true D student.
- Thank you.

10:19.737 --> 10:21.490
If your dad could see you now.

10:21.781 --> 10:24.700
What were your parents doing
by the bike pass so early this morning?

10:24.783 --> 10:26.785
Looks like they were picking flowers.

10:26.868 --> 10:29.036
- My parents were picking flowers?
- Yeah.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.496
- He even waved hello and everything.
- You're nuts.

10:31.579 --> 10:34.416
They wouldn't be out picking flowers
at this hour of morning.

10:34.499 --> 10:37.750
My dad didn't even go to work today.
He told Mom he felt sick.

10:38.584 --> 10:40.169
Sure was acting strange.

10:40.254 --> 10:41.337
Hi, guys.

10:41.421 --> 10:42.671
- How's it going, Sunny?
- Hi.

10:42.754 --> 10:44.881
You're to read this in private.
It's from Sal.

10:44.964 --> 10:46.133
- Who?
- Sally.

10:46.967 --> 10:48.592
Who'd you think I said?

10:49.051 --> 10:50.552
Hi, Melanie.

10:53.638 --> 10:56.223
Is she the reason
you haven't asked Sally to carnival?

10:56.306 --> 10:58.767
Sal is the reason
I haven't asked Sal to the carnival.

10:58.849 --> 11:01.060
Melanie Rose, the cowgirl
of Crystal Lake High?

11:01.143 --> 11:03.561
Carnival is a dance, Skip, not a rodeo.

11:03.645 --> 11:05.105
Knock it off, Sunny.

11:06.523 --> 11:09.357
To get her attention, Skip,
you gotta be a horse.

11:15.529 --> 11:17.447
The man is a nut, Steve.

11:19.698 --> 11:22.867
Somebody up there
takes Eli Jaffe very seriously.

11:22.951 --> 11:24.203
Only five people...

11:24.286 --> 11:27.913
have ever given the IADC a direct order
and he's one of them.

11:27.996 --> 11:31.542
When I got there, it took ten minutes
and every credit card in my purse...

11:31.624 --> 11:33.917
to convince him
I was really who I said I was.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.794
As for this, well...

11:36.795 --> 11:40.297
You know what he made me promise
before he'd let me leave?

11:40.381 --> 11:43.050
That you wouldn't open it
until you got to Crystal Lake.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.218
Like I said. The man is a nut.

11:45.301 --> 11:47.843
Just think of this trip
as an easy assignment.

11:48.260 --> 11:51.055
Yeah, right. Shouldn't be too hard.

11:51.138 --> 11:54.307
Seeing how I have no idea
what my assignment is, outside of:

11:54.391 --> 11:57.018
"Go to Crystal Lake and be careful. "

11:57.227 --> 12:00.229
And keep in touch. I mean it, Diana.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.148
Every afternoon at 4:00,
I want to hear that phone ring.

12:04.899 --> 12:07.400
Are you holding something
out on me, Steve?

12:07.651 --> 12:11.611
No, not really. It's just that
in the course of his research...

12:11.695 --> 12:14.615
Jaffe gathers and analyzes
radio signals from deep space.

12:14.698 --> 12:16.407
- I'm aware of that.
- Okay.

12:16.491 --> 12:19.743
A couple of months ago,
remember the rash of UFO sightings...

12:19.826 --> 12:22.621
- we had in Australia and New Zealand?
- Yes.

12:22.787 --> 12:26.873
It's been rumored that Dr. Eli Jaffe
predicted those sightings would occur.

12:27.248 --> 12:28.708
He predicted?

12:29.084 --> 12:31.835
How can someone predict a UFO sighting?

15:02.613 --> 15:04.156
Not these boots, Mom.

15:04.239 --> 15:07.241
The ones I got from Uncle Rex in Arizona,
the cowboy boots?

15:07.325 --> 15:09.285
You said you wouldn't be caught dead
in them.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.327
- Now I need them.
- What on earth for?

15:11.411 --> 15:13.247
Ma, just tell me where they are.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.789
- The closet in the spare bedroom.
- Thanks.

15:18.457 --> 15:19.668
How's your homework?

15:19.751 --> 15:22.628
There's no school tomorrow.
I thought I'd do it tomorrow night.

15:22.712 --> 15:25.589
- Do it now.
- I'll just do it tomorrow night.

15:26.423 --> 15:27.716
Right now.

15:28.716 --> 15:32.302
You're going to show it to me
in the morning. And if I find one mistake...

15:32.385 --> 15:35.220
holiday or no,
you're not going anywhere tomorrow.

15:37.346 --> 15:40.391
Seeing that public education
isn't completely wasted on you...

15:40.475 --> 15:43.476
is the least I can do
for the taxpayers of this state.

15:43.934 --> 15:46.145
When's he gonna get off my back, Ma?

15:46.812 --> 15:49.480
Your getting decent grades
is very important to him.

15:49.564 --> 15:51.774
Just because he got
straight A's in school?

15:51.858 --> 15:54.693
Nowadays you get those grades,
kids think you're a freak.

15:54.776 --> 15:57.279
Is that why you get C's and D's?
To be accepted?

15:57.362 --> 15:59.113
No, I get them because I'm stupid.

15:59.197 --> 16:02.240
If that's the reason, Steven Keller,
you certainly are.

16:05.368 --> 16:06.910
Did I hear Ed Pearson?

16:06.994 --> 16:08.662
Why didn't you ask him in?

16:08.745 --> 16:10.538
He was dropping something off.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.165
Well, good.
I was on my way to the bathtub, anyway.

16:13.582 --> 16:17.487
John, could you take it easy on Skip?
He's a good kid.

16:55.379 --> 16:56.465
Thank you.

16:59.470 --> 17:02.770
I'm just going to have some orange juice
and toast, please.

17:02.979 --> 17:04.273
Whole wheat.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.291
Well, Dr. Jaffe...

17:14.086 --> 17:16.968
let's see what's in here
that's so important.

17:20.348 --> 17:22.731
I feel like a kid on Christmas morning.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.404
But What is it I'm looking for?

17:27.281 --> 17:29.160
You'll know when you find it.

17:29.536 --> 17:32.792
I think he is nuts
and I'm sitting here talking to myself.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.058
Coffee, Diana?

17:41.521 --> 17:43.149
Cameron Michaels.

17:43.232 --> 17:46.238
Thought you'd be more likely
to recognize me this way.

17:48.327 --> 17:49.455
Sorry.

17:52.419 --> 17:55.176
The people of Crystal Lake
obviously have no sense of humor.

17:55.259 --> 17:56.343
Obviously.

17:57.012 --> 18:00.102
I had no idea that Dr. Jaffe
was sending you over here, too.

18:00.186 --> 18:01.354
Last-minute orders.

18:01.438 --> 18:04.277
I'm afraid he didn't tell me
anything beyond what he told you.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.405
Terrific.

18:05.489 --> 18:09.246
I was supposed to look you up
and go over his notes with you.

18:09.330 --> 18:10.833
I just got started.

18:15.009 --> 18:18.223
Do you have any idea
what it is we are looking for?

18:18.893 --> 18:20.897
Well, according to his notes...

18:21.858 --> 18:23.234
we're after this...

18:24.990 --> 18:28.371
which has landed here...

18:30.292 --> 18:32.214
in exactly 99 pieces.

18:33.299 --> 18:35.846
You mean the pieces have fallen,
don't you?

18:35.930 --> 18:37.976
Dr. Jaffe says "landed. "

18:46.536 --> 18:47.788
Hi, Mom.

18:47.872 --> 18:51.422
Hey! Save some for the fish.
Where's Dad?

18:51.714 --> 18:54.094
- Upstairs.
- Here's my homework.

18:54.428 --> 18:56.056
Perfect. Just like him.

18:56.684 --> 18:58.813
Skip, stay home today, okay?

18:58.896 --> 19:00.440
But, Ma, it's a holiday.

19:00.817 --> 19:02.529
I think your father's ill.

19:02.612 --> 19:04.534
All the more reason
for me not to stay home.

19:04.617 --> 19:07.832
I can't get sick. I got things to do.
Bye, Mom.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.557
You mean there's nothing else?

19:15.640 --> 19:18.605
He doesn't explain
why we're looking for these trapezoids?

19:18.689 --> 19:21.236
Tetrahedrons. That's it.

19:22.238 --> 19:23.741
Well, this is crazy.

19:23.951 --> 19:26.038
Anything falling to earth
from outer space...

19:26.122 --> 19:29.462
would either disintegrate
or cause a very noticeable crater.

19:31.425 --> 19:34.222
Unless they landed instead of fell.

19:36.101 --> 19:39.275
Cameron, is Dr. Jaffe's research
so sophisticated...

19:39.358 --> 19:43.659
that he could've overheard a celestial
conversation about the pyramid?

19:44.661 --> 19:46.164
It's a possibility.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.336
I'm going to the police.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.384
See if they've gotten reports
on anything unusual.

19:51.634 --> 19:54.934
I'll put on my hiking boots
and start combing these hills...

19:55.018 --> 19:57.021
- for the tetra...
- Hedrons.

19:57.647 --> 19:59.151
- See you.
- Yes.

19:59.944 --> 20:01.197
Keep in touch.

20:07.377 --> 20:08.922
Tetrahedrons.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.699
Hey, Melanie!

20:45.099 --> 20:47.766
Hi, Mel. Going riding, too?

20:48.058 --> 20:49.560
I board here.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.687
- This your horse?
- Misty.

20:54.270 --> 20:58.106
Misty. She's beautiful.

20:59.690 --> 21:03.441
- He.
- Yeah, he.

21:04.651 --> 21:06.943
So, why don't we go riding together?

21:08.735 --> 21:11.697
Well, I was gonna practice in the ring.

21:11.863 --> 21:13.489
I got a show coming up.

21:14.656 --> 21:15.991
Thank you.

21:17.323 --> 21:20.033
- I didn't know you rode.
- Oh, yeah.

21:20.951 --> 21:24.120
Got an uncle in Arizona.
That's where I got these boots.

21:24.245 --> 21:25.745
They look brand new.

21:29.165 --> 21:31.623
I like to keep them real clean, you know?

21:33.291 --> 21:35.834
Well, have a nice ride.

21:37.002 --> 21:39.795
Sure you don't want to go with me?
Give me some pointers?

21:39.878 --> 21:42.046
Always wanted to be in a horse show.

21:45.256 --> 21:48.924
If you really think there's something
I can teach you about riding.

21:49.633 --> 21:51.883
- Sure there is.
- Okay.

21:55.637 --> 21:56.970
Like everything.

21:57.387 --> 21:58.847
Now, easy, okay?

22:21.316 --> 22:22.858
This is crazy.

22:48.498 --> 22:50.831
Why don't you ride ahead of me
so I can watch?

22:50.915 --> 22:53.792
No, it's okay.
I'll just warm up a little bit.

22:55.752 --> 22:58.127
- Who taught you how to ride?
- I did.

22:58.628 --> 23:01.922
That's right. You used to live on that ranch
in Wyoming.

23:02.463 --> 23:04.047
How did you know?

23:04.339 --> 23:06.342
Everyone at school knows that.

23:08.883 --> 23:10.842
Why don't we warm up?

23:41.859 --> 23:44.320
Do you mind? I'd like to see that.

24:33.053 --> 24:35.138
I think my saddle's a little loose.

24:36.222 --> 24:38.848
Skip, why are you here?

24:40.725 --> 24:42.058
What do you mean?

24:42.392 --> 24:45.767
I know what kind of games you guys play
behind people's backs.

24:46.185 --> 24:49.229
How you make fun of them
without them even knowing it.

24:49.897 --> 24:52.230
I'm not here to make fun of you, Mel.

24:52.690 --> 24:55.959
I'm here because I like you. A lot.

25:21.928 --> 25:24.058
Skip!

25:38.455 --> 25:41.127
Turn him, Skip! Turn him.

25:42.212 --> 25:43.297
Wonder Woman.

25:43.379 --> 25:46.177
Please, you got to trust me.
Let me take your horse.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.348
All right, Wonder Woman. Hurry.

27:11.898 --> 27:14.237
You're okay now, Skip, relax.

27:14.579 --> 27:16.749
He'll take you back, won't you, boy?

27:16.832 --> 27:18.211
Don't be afraid.

27:58.448 --> 28:00.369
You scared me to death.

28:01.829 --> 28:03.456
Did you see what happened back there?

28:03.540 --> 28:07.131
People who don't know how to ride
have no business being on top of a horse.

28:07.215 --> 28:09.259
If you want to get yourself killed, fine.

28:09.343 --> 28:11.515
Just don't bother doing it in front of me.

28:11.598 --> 28:13.683
But didn't you see what happened?

28:22.491 --> 28:25.539
Melanie?

28:31.174 --> 28:32.299
Wouldn't you know it?

28:32.384 --> 28:34.888
Wonder Woman saves my life
and there's no one to tell.

28:34.972 --> 28:36.349
You can tell me.

28:38.186 --> 28:41.233
- Hi. I'm Diana Prince.
- Skip Keller.

28:41.316 --> 28:42.695
My horse was running away...

28:42.778 --> 28:46.200
and Wonder Woman took Mel's
and caught up... She is incredible.

28:46.283 --> 28:48.955
I understand she's pretty good
at things like that.

28:49.038 --> 28:50.625
Hey, look who's here.

28:52.335 --> 28:54.548
See, he doesn't hold any grudges.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.640
Here he goes.
Looks pretty hot, let's walk him.

28:59.724 --> 29:02.061
Guess it's not his fault
I didn't know how to ride.

29:02.145 --> 29:05.067
I got to tell you, Diana,
that Wonder Woman is incredible.

29:05.150 --> 29:07.195
I take it you live in town?

29:08.281 --> 29:11.998
I imagine that things get around
this town pretty fast, don't they?

29:12.081 --> 29:14.167
Things get around extremely fast.

29:14.291 --> 29:15.544
Well, now listen...

29:15.628 --> 29:18.883
have you seen, or do you know anyone
who's seen any strange rocks?

29:18.967 --> 29:22.474
- Kind of like solid triangles?
- No.

29:23.433 --> 29:25.895
Well, I know this sounds crazy...

29:25.979 --> 29:29.235
but I'm from out of town
and I need all the help I can get.

29:29.403 --> 29:32.533
If you come across anyone
who has one or has seen one...

29:32.616 --> 29:34.704
would you let me know,
or have them let me know?

29:34.787 --> 29:37.918
I'm staying at the Crystal Lake Motel.
It's Diana Prince.

29:38.459 --> 29:40.590
And I'm a lot saner than I sound.

29:44.262 --> 29:45.596
I sure hope so.

29:58.704 --> 29:59.791
Mom?

30:00.916 --> 30:02.628
Where is everybody?

30:04.716 --> 30:06.302
Mom? You asleep?

30:10.977 --> 30:12.271
You all right?

31:13.880 --> 31:15.799
It's about time you came home.

31:22.103 --> 31:23.732
What's happened to Mom?

31:24.107 --> 31:25.652
It's painless.

31:32.998 --> 31:36.421
- You're not my father.
- Of course I am.

31:42.349 --> 31:43.934
Mom, what's happening?

31:47.440 --> 31:48.943
Tell me, please.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.452
Just a minute.

32:44.542 --> 32:46.547
- Skip.
- I saw one of those rocks.

32:46.672 --> 32:47.798
Come on in.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.015
- Where?
- My house.

32:53.392 --> 32:55.018
It did something to my mom and dad.

32:55.102 --> 32:58.734
- What are you talking about?
- They aren't my parents anymore.

32:59.027 --> 33:01.865
They look like my mom and dad,
but they're not.

33:02.491 --> 33:04.913
Mom tried to tell me
something was wrong.

33:06.581 --> 33:08.002
Where do you live?

33:08.168 --> 33:10.674
- I'm not going back there.
- You don't have to.

33:10.757 --> 33:13.803
I was thinking a friend of mine
could check things out.

33:14.137 --> 33:15.640
Then you believe me?

36:27.022 --> 36:28.359
Hey, Pete?

36:32.491 --> 36:35.747
Am I glad you're here.
I've got something to tell you.

36:41.258 --> 36:42.469
You do?

36:46.432 --> 36:48.562
Let's go somewhere and talk then.

36:51.275 --> 36:52.401
Come on.

36:54.406 --> 36:56.033
What's happened to you?

36:56.534 --> 36:59.622
Nothing. Come on.
I want to show you something.

37:09.683 --> 37:11.353
What's going on?

37:11.437 --> 37:14.024
If you'd cooperate, you'd understand.

37:17.114 --> 37:19.117
It's really not that bad, Skip.

37:25.295 --> 37:27.798
Skip?

38:06.576 --> 38:08.204
What's going on here?

38:23.483 --> 38:26.069
Skip? Are you in here?

40:10.423 --> 40:11.551
Diana?

40:33.088 --> 40:34.548
Are you all right?

40:37.805 --> 40:40.225
Yes, I'm all right. I'm all right, Skip.

40:41.437 --> 40:42.897
What is that thing?

40:45.944 --> 40:47.947
There's something inside of it.

40:48.407 --> 40:49.784
Something alive.

40:51.663 --> 40:55.002
It was trading places with me
and I couldn't stop it.

41:02.684 --> 41:05.688
Diana? Diana, are you in there?

41:06.355 --> 41:08.610
- Don't let him in.
- It's all right, I know him.

41:08.694 --> 41:09.737
He may not-

41:09.820 --> 41:13.200
Thank goodness I caught up with you.
The people in this place are nuts!

41:13.284 --> 41:16.417
I asked questions at the police station.
They trumped up a charge...

41:16.500 --> 41:19.211
and tried to throw me in jail!
Everyone acts...

41:20.883 --> 41:22.259
The pieces.

41:23.052 --> 41:24.762
- Don't touch it.
- He's right.

41:24.846 --> 41:27.060
- Keep away from it.
- That's what we came to find.

41:27.144 --> 41:28.353
Cam, listen to me.

41:28.437 --> 41:31.150
Dr. Jaffe was right
when he used the word "landed. "

41:31.233 --> 41:35.116
The pyramid that broke apart
was no asteroid and it was no satellite.

41:35.199 --> 41:38.538
- It was some kind of vehicle.
- A space ship?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.753
Each of the 99 pieces
contains some kind of life form:

41:41.836 --> 41:45.468
a being, intelligent energy, I don't know.
But something.

41:45.551 --> 41:49.265
In order for them to function
on our planet, they need our bodies.

41:50.685 --> 41:54.483
Are you trying to say that
those people acting nuts out there...

41:54.566 --> 41:56.739
have been somehow possessed?

41:56.822 --> 41:59.617
I know what I'm talking about.
Believe me.

42:01.287 --> 42:02.540
What do we do?

42:02.623 --> 42:05.126
First of all,
we get a hold of the good Dr. Jaffe...

42:05.210 --> 42:08.132
now that we know he knows
a lot more than he's telling.

42:08.216 --> 42:09.929
Skip, what are you doing?

42:10.427 --> 42:13.726
They got my mom and my dad
and got my best friend...

42:15.063 --> 42:16.648
now I got one of them.

42:21.238 --> 42:24.996
There're going to be a lot of people
who want to take a look at that.

42:30.631 --> 42:32.218
If we get out of here.

42:36.725 --> 42:39.606
Don't exactly look like
the Welcome Wagon, do they?

42:42.818 --> 42:45.658
See their faces? All of them look like that.

42:48.663 --> 42:51.586
They have that same expression
in their eyes.

42:54.381 --> 42:56.177
We've got to get past them.

42:56.427 --> 42:59.015
Meet me at the stables
on Lakeridge Road in 10 minutes.

42:59.099 --> 43:00.351
You're not going anywhere.

43:00.434 --> 43:02.856
I'll divert them. Then you guys take off.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.980
That fool kid has the meteor fragment.

43:32.283 --> 43:33.827
Cam, let's go.

44:14.484 --> 44:16.361
- Yes.
- Dr. Jaffe to see you.

44:16.444 --> 44:18.158
By all means send him in.

44:22.497 --> 44:25.127
Colonel Trevor? I'm Eli Jaffe.

44:26.380 --> 44:28.466
I just hope you've come here to tell me...

44:28.550 --> 44:32.349
why the agent you insisted
I send to Crystal Lake hasn't reported in.

44:32.432 --> 44:35.353
- You've heard nothing from her?
- The silence is deafening.

44:35.437 --> 44:37.024
Now I want some answers.

44:37.107 --> 44:39.153
She has the answers, I'm afraid.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.908
She must have them all.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.728
Mel?

45:27.990 --> 45:29.326
No.

45:46.815 --> 45:48.569
You're overreacting, Skip.

46:01.217 --> 46:03.636
- We can't just leave him.
- He's not here.

46:03.844 --> 46:04.973
He will be.

46:05.057 --> 46:07.978
He's probably coming by
one of the horse trails or something.

46:08.062 --> 46:10.231
It's just taking him longer than he figured.

46:10.315 --> 46:12.819
Every minute we wait
is a minute they gain.

46:15.659 --> 46:17.286
Maybe he's inside.

46:30.393 --> 46:32.731
You're really being very stupid, Skip.

46:34.734 --> 46:36.904
No.

46:40.244 --> 46:41.996
There's nothing to it.

46:42.581 --> 46:44.626
No, Pete. No.

46:46.881 --> 46:48.217
Skip!

46:53.226 --> 46:54.977
Skip, you'll be all right?

46:58.276 --> 46:59.987
Cam, go after those two.

47:01.281 --> 47:02.701
And you stay here.
