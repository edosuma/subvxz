00:00.490 --> 00:02.190
<i>Previously on:</i> Two and a half men

00:02.190 --> 00:05.010
Wait. Judith threw Herb out? When?

00:05.010 --> 00:06.560
Apparently, about a week ago.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.670
Of course you can't compete hard body to hard body,

00:08.670 --> 00:10.830
but you're still a very desirable woman.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.530
You think so?

00:12.530 --> 00:15.060
Oh! Oh, Alan.

00:15.060 --> 00:18.470
You're a good man, and I'm never gonna let you go again.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.240
Never?

00:23.700 --> 00:25.300
I thought you'd be happy.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.760
I thought so, too.

00:26.830 --> 00:28.000
I mean, come on.

00:28.060 --> 00:30.060
You had the woman who took all your money

00:30.130 --> 00:33.030
and threw you out of your house, naked and crouched on the sofa.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.460
There was no sofa.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.560
It was the divan in her bedroom, and I was doing the crouching.

00:37.630 --> 00:38.830
Why were you...?

00:38.900 --> 00:40.600
Never mind. I don't want to know.

00:40.660 --> 00:43.500
The point is, you won.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.700
You had a perfect night of revenge sex.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.330
That's the fourth best kind of sex you can have.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.730
Fourth?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.060
What are the other...?

00:51.130 --> 00:52.700
Never mind. I don't want to know.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.830
Charlie, the problem is that now that Judith and Herb are over,

00:55.900 --> 00:57.400
she thinks that we're...

00:58.360 --> 01:00.400
...back to square one

01:00.460 --> 01:04.500
in dealing with the PTA <i>carnival.</i>

01:04.560 --> 01:06.030
What?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.630
The-The school carnival

01:07.700 --> 01:10.160
that we used to, uh, raise money for.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.930
I don't want Jake to know about me and Judith...

01:13.000 --> 01:14.900
...Ithcariot.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.430
Judith Ithcariot.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.830
Who thold out our lord for 30 pieces of thilver.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.660
What are you talking about?

01:21.730 --> 01:23.830
Oh, I was just, uh, telling your uncle

01:23.900 --> 01:26.430
about this, uh... this, uh... this great, uh, cartoon.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.630
Uh, "Daffy Duck and the Greateth Sthory Ever Told."

01:30.630 --> 01:31.600
Sounds lame.

01:31.660 --> 01:33.800
Classic Warner Brothers animation.

01:34.930 --> 01:37.530
Boy, you really suck at this.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.130
The thing is, I'm not sure I want to be back with Judith.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.800
Well, let's look at the pros and cons.

01:42.860 --> 01:44.900
The pros are, if you move out,

01:44.960 --> 01:47.300
I'll have an empty guest room....

01:47.360 --> 01:51.800
tinest, tootin'est apostle in all of Jerusalem.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.200
Gethsemane Sam!

01:53.260 --> 01:54.930
What?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.430
Or how about Barabas Bunny?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.660
Uh, what's up, Pontius?

02:00.860 --> 02:03.130
If Berta finds out you're leaving,

02:03.130 --> 02:05.170
she'll want your room, and I n't need a live-in maid.

02:05.170 --> 02:06.300
Oh, don't worry. I'm not leaving.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.080
Oh, good, 'cause I was worried.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.789
Look,

02:09.789 --> 02:11.770
I have already been married to Judith, and we...

02:11.770 --> 02:13.320
We... We...

02:13.320 --> 02:15.780
We should send Jack to military school?

02:15.780 --> 02:17.480
What?

02:17.480 --> 02:18.880
Oh, oh, uh, yeah.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.950
Charlie, he wasn't supposed to hear that.

02:20.950 --> 02:22.590
I'm going to military school?

02:22.590 --> 02:24.260
If you don't shape up, yeah.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.620
And it's not gonna be our military, either.

02:28.970 --> 02:31.700
I don't want to go to any military school.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.710
Well, then, you better get to your homework.

02:33.710 --> 02:34.960
Okay, okay.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.010
Extortion.So simple.

02:39.010 --> 02:40.560
Who knew?

02:41.960 --> 02:43.480
If the kid's going to military school,

02:43.480 --> 02:45.070
I'll take his room.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.230
No, no, Berta, you misunderstood.

02:48.230 --> 02:49.930
He's not going to military school?

02:49.930 --> 02:51.070
I'm not going to military school?!

02:51.070 --> 02:52.870
You <i>are</i> going to military school!

02:52.870 --> 02:54.400
He's not going to military school.

02:54.730 --> 02:56.460
Okay, then, I'll take Zippy's room

02:56.460 --> 02:58.190
when he moves back to Judith.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.450
Oh, for God's sake, does she hear everything?

03:03.450 --> 03:05.790
Some things I just infer.

第六季  第七集

03:22.100 --> 03:23.830
Get me another beer, would you?

03:23.900 --> 03:26.500
Why can't you get it yourself?

03:26.560 --> 03:29.160
(Reveille)

03:37.760 --> 03:40.130
This is beautiful.

03:46.130 --> 03:48.300
Hey, Judith. What's shakin'?

03:48.360 --> 03:50.760
Mom, I'll be good! Don't send me to military school!

03:50.830 --> 03:53.660
Where's that beer, maggot?

03:55.560 --> 03:57.500
Nothing. Nothing.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.130
Just a little game we're playing.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.960
So anyway, Judy, what's new in your little world?

04:03.030 --> 04:04.900
Hang on. I'll see if he's here.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.300
Oh, no, no. I'm not here. I'm not here.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.230
Sorry, he's not here.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.430
Oh, wait. He just walked in.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.330
Why?

04:15.400 --> 04:17.459
Why not?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.000
Oh, hey, hey, Judith.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.830
I was just about to call you.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.630
Hold on a sec.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.600
Let me... Let me get some privacy.

04:27.660 --> 04:29.160
What are they talking about?

04:29.230 --> 04:31.260
Nothing important.

04:36.730 --> 04:39.500
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.160
Where's Jake?

04:49.230 --> 04:50.800
Washing my car.

04:52.630 --> 04:55.400
Then he's gonna clean the garage.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.730
We should have thought of this years ago.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.300
I know. I'm kicking myself.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.930
Okay, I won't be late.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.100
Hot date with the ex?

05:03.160 --> 05:05.100
Oh, no, nothing hot about it.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.530
It's just dinner, and I'm going to tell her

05:06.600 --> 05:08.000
that the other night was just a onetime thing,

05:08.060 --> 05:09.760
and that I don't see that we have a future together.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.030
But me you see a future with?

05:14.530 --> 05:16.300
I finished the garage.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.260
You sure?

05:17.330 --> 05:19.230
Yeah.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.500
("The Halls of Montezuma")

05:21.560 --> 05:22.860
Let me look again.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.860
More wine?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.060
Oh, I'd-I'd better not.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.230
I have to drive.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.930
Have some more wine.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Maybe a splash.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.300
Oh, oh, my.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.430
I, uh, hope this is a good driving wine.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.060
Oh, that-that feels good.

05:50.130 --> 05:51.330
I'm glad.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.700
Have you been working out?

05:52.760 --> 05:54.030
Oh, just the Bowflex.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.400
I, uh, had to give up my gym membership

05:56.460 --> 05:58.300
so I could get my tooth filled.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.930
Well, whatever you're doing, it's working.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.330
A lot of definition here.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.000
Oh, Oh, that would be this one.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.200
Oh, yeah, there it is.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.060
So, would you like some dessert?

06:10.130 --> 06:11.660
Oh, oh, don't go to any trouble.

06:11.730 --> 06:12.900
It's no trouble, sweetie.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.460
I like taking care of you.

06:14.530 --> 06:17.160
And I like being taken care of.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.460
Wake up! Wake up!

06:23.530 --> 06:27.120
Um, uh, listen, Judith,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.750
I-I've been thinking about you and me.

06:29.750 --> 06:30.720
Me, too.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.250
Oh. . Oh, good.

06:32.710 --> 06:33.610
You know, even though

06:33.610 --> 06:35.020
the other night was wonderful and all,

06:35.020 --> 06:36.280
I think it might be better

06:36.280 --> 06:38.980
if we tried slowing things down a bit.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.620
I agree. You do?

06:40.620 --> 06:43.310
Of course. I'm barely out of my marriage to Herb.

06:43.310 --> 06:43.920
True, true.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.080
Here, careful. Hot pudding.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.400
So, uh, you'll get the divorce,

06:48.400 --> 06:49.870
and then, you know, we'll see where we are.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.200
That sounds great. Well, good.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.330
I'm, uh... I'm glad we're on the same page.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.400
-Oh, hot.  -I told you it was hot.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.790
Hot! Hot! Hot!

06:59.790 --> 07:01.110
Have some more wine.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.160
That's better. That's better.

07:03.230 --> 07:04.500
I'll get your spoon.

07:04.530 --> 07:05.800
Oh. Oh, God.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.860
<i>Oh....</i> pudding!

07:14.130 --> 07:17.030
So when the moment's right, and she's ready,

07:17.100 --> 07:18.630
you'll be ready, too.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.730
Side effects may include, nausea, headaches, dry mouth,

07:20.800 --> 07:22.360
blurred vision, dizziness, anal leakage,

07:22.430 --> 07:24.300
kidney failure and massive stroke.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.630
She'd better be ready to call an ambulance.

07:32.460 --> 07:33.730
Is Jake asleep?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.060
Probably not.

07:35.130 --> 07:37.400
After dinner, I made him watch  <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>

07:37.460 --> 07:38.560
and <i>Deerhunter.</i>

07:38.630 --> 07:40.760
Oh, Charlie.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.100
And how was your evening?

07:42.160 --> 07:44.960
Oh, it was really a lot of fun.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.800
You know, I'd forgotten how nice she can be.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.200
Judith?

07:49.260 --> 07:51.060
Who else would I be talking about?

07:51.130 --> 07:54.030
I don't know. Somebody actually nice.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.400
What was the name of Jimmy Carter's wife?

07:57.460 --> 07:58.460
Rosalynn?

07:58.530 --> 08:00.960
She was nice.

08:01.030 --> 08:03.400
I always got a good vibe off her.

08:03.460 --> 08:06.000
Are you drunk?

08:09.830 --> 08:11.760
Define drunk.

08:11.830 --> 08:14.160
Would you rather I talk to you in the morning?

08:14.230 --> 08:17.200
No, no. The liquor makes you more interesting. Go on.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.860
Judith's changed, Charlie.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.930
She's-She's a different woman.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.760
Different than the one who threw you out of your house

08:24.860 --> 08:27.300
with your nuts in a to-go bag?

08:27.360 --> 08:29.760
That's a little graphic, don't you think?

08:29.830 --> 08:31.100
I'm an artist, Alan.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.260
I paint with words.

08:33.330 --> 08:34.760
You're a lush, Charlie.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.159
You paint with vomit.

08:38.330 --> 08:42.600
My point is that Judith has become a warm, nurturing woman.

08:42.659 --> 08:44.630
You nailed her again, didn't you?

08:44.700 --> 08:47.430
No, no, no, it was just, just the one time.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.560
Tonight, we did not have sex.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.360
Technically.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.830
Really? Judith?

08:53.900 --> 08:57.400
I know. I had to keep peeking to make sure it was her.

09:01.490 --> 09:02.910
Well, congratulations.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.610
So when are you gonna move back in?

09:04.610 --> 09:05.970
Ah, we're not quite there yet.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.360
Oh, come on, why wait?

09:07.690 --> 09:09.800
We could load up the car and drive over there tonight.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.830
You promised if I shaped up, I wouldn't have to go!

09:17.370 --> 09:19.880
Aren't you starting to feel a little guilty about misleading him?

09:20.460 --> 09:21.720
Yeah, I guess.

09:22.410 --> 09:23.070
Tell you what.

09:23.070 --> 09:25.150
After he finishes cleaning the deck tomorrow,

09:25.150 --> 09:27.660
let's really senend him to military school.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.430
How's it going?

09:36.500 --> 09:37.930
I'm almost done.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.230
What about the railing?

09:39.300 --> 09:41.430
It's getting dark. I won't finish in time.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.330
No problem. I'll give you a hand.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.600
Gee, thanks.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.860
You back-talkin' me, soldier?

09:48.930 --> 09:50.000
No.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.130
No what?

09:51.200 --> 09:54.030
No way?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.430
No, sir.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.830
Right. No, sir.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.560
That's better.

09:58.630 --> 10:03.760
* I don't know, what I've been told *

10:03.830 --> 10:07.260
* Screwin' with jughead never gets old. *

10:07.330 --> 10:09.730
Okay, don't wait up.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.830
Hey, Alan,

10:11.900 --> 10:13.330
the chimney's a little blocked up

10:13.400 --> 10:15.100
with leaves and crap, and I thought,

10:15.160 --> 10:17.300
maybe if I tied a rope around the kid,

10:17.360 --> 10:19.000
I could lower him down into it...

10:19.060 --> 10:21.700
Charlie, that borders on child abuse.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.530
So, it's okay?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.130
Around his waist, not his neck.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.400
Good night, Jake.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.530
Good night, Dad. I love you.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.030
Oh, Herb, hi.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.100
Hey, Alan, Charlie.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.460
Hey, Herb. What's up?

10:36.530 --> 10:38.630
Well, I was just on my way down to The Sand Dollar.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.630
I thought maybe you and Alan would like to join me.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.630
It's ladies night.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.800
What do you say, Alan?

10:42.860 --> 10:44.630
You can get in for half price.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.860
Plus, all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.560
Just keeps getting better, huh?

10:51.630 --> 10:54.400
No, I-I-I... I have other plans.

10:54.460 --> 10:55.960
Oh. Got a date?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.230
Yeah, Alan.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.100
You got a date?

10:59.160 --> 11:00.730
gn No. A date?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.630
Not likely.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.130
No, I have a-a-a... a meeting with the, uh,

11:05.200 --> 11:07.830
the-the-the thing about the... about the group.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.000
I told you. Remember?

11:09.060 --> 11:11.700
No. Tell me again.

11:13.030 --> 11:15.130
He's a little pickled.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.700
Uh, well, if you must know, uh, uh,

11:19.760 --> 11:22.030
I-I-I-I belong to a...

11:22.100 --> 11:25.030
a book club that I am going to.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.800
Oh, that's right.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.300
What book are you reading again?

11:29.360 --> 11:31.630
It's... it's a mystery,

11:31.700 --> 11:35.300
uh, called <i>Why Are You</i>  <i>Doing This To Me?</i>

11:35.360 --> 11:37.900
Oh, yeah, it's by the same guy

11:37.960 --> 11:41.130
who wrote  <i>Because It Amuses Me.</i>

11:42.160 --> 11:45.700
Boy, I wouldn't havead you two pegged as readers.

11:47.060 --> 11:49.730
Well, there you go.

11:49.730 --> 11:50.550
Good night.

11:50.550 --> 11:51.790
-Hey, Alan?  -Yeah?

11:51.790 --> 11:53.790
You talk much to Judith these days?

11:53.790 --> 11:54.780
-Nope, see you.  -Oh, well,

11:55.060 --> 11:57.100
you speak to her, tell her I say hi.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.790
-Okay.  -And that the

11:59.160 --> 12:01.140
time we spent together is very special to me,

12:01.890 --> 12:04.230
and if she needs anything, uh, just call me.

12:04.770 --> 12:05.770
I'm there.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.930
u know what's a good book?

12:10.350 --> 12:13.750
<i>Under the Dining Room Table</i> by Richard Gobbler.

12:16.700 --> 12:20.850
But... but it does not compare

12:20.850 --> 12:23.890
to <i>Wait Till Your Liver Fails</i> by Hope Udai.

12:29.550 --> 12:31.830
Well, what do you say, Charlie, huh?

12:31.830 --> 12:32.580
Me and you?

12:32.910 --> 12:35.260
Go down to the Sand Dollar, have a few drinks.

12:35.260 --> 12:37.340
Who knows, maybe we'll meet a couple of nice gals.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.290
Sure, why not?

12:39.690 --> 12:41.300
And if the pickings are slim,

12:41.300 --> 12:43.210
you could always wrangle up some of your prostitute friends.

12:44.950 --> 12:45.550
Oh, boy.

12:45.550 --> 12:47.440
Prostitutes and popcorn shrimp.

12:48.140 --> 12:49.410
All you can eat.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.270
Okay, Herb,

12:54.270 --> 12:55.990
let me explain to you something about hookers.

12:58.190 --> 12:59.480
Oh, man.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.960
Who's been feeding the seagulls blueberries?

13:05.560 --> 13:06.760
Here you go.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.730
Oh, qui brille.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.700
Yummy.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.700
Oops, I dropped my spoon.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.100
Um, you know, I... I ran into Herb today.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.330
What?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.500
He came by the house.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.330
Why would he come by your house?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.930
I just think he's lonely.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.400
He misses you.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.500
Well, too bad.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.630
So, you don't miss him?

13:47.700 --> 13:49.800
Ow, ow, Alan!

13:49.860 --> 13:52.090
Are we gonna spend all night talking about Herb

13:52.090 --> 13:53.460
or do you want me to get my spoon?

13:53.530 --> 13:55.600
Well, if you're gonna bark at me,

13:55.600 --> 13:57.250
there's really no point in you getting your spoon.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.700
I'm not barking at you, I'm...

13:59.760 --> 14:00.960
You're right.

14:01.030 --> 14:02.100
I'm sorry.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.460
I'm right <i>and</i> you're sorry?

14:06.030 --> 14:07.200
Let's not waste the night arguing

14:07.260 --> 14:10.700
when we could spend it doing anything you want.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.060
Anything?

14:13.130 --> 14:14.600
Anything.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.660
Can you say I'm right again?

14:22.810 --> 14:24.400
Jesus,herb. you live here?

14:24.400 --> 14:26.100
This is really depressing.

14:26.100 --> 14:26.780
You should see i during the day.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.330
You'd want to hang yourself.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.830
Well, ladies,

14:30.900 --> 14:33.130
welcome to Casa de Herb.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.660
That's Spanish for House of Herb.

14:35.730 --> 14:37.760
-Just open the door. -Hold on.

14:37.830 --> 14:41.400
I'll trade you the lounge lizard for the Jolly Green Jackass.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.760
I hope you gals like trains.

14:42.830 --> 14:43.930
Slow down, buddy.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.430
It's just the two of us.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.130
All aboard!

14:54.460 --> 14:57.860
I bet you thought this was gonna be weird.

14:58.740 --> 14:59.700
Pretty nice, huh?

14:59.700 --> 15:01.220
Best H.O. money can buy.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.330
You don't have to spell it, Herb.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.350
They know what they are.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.490
So, shall we get this party started?

15:07.800 --> 15:08.540
Okeydokey.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.080
Would you like a snack or a cold beverage?

15:12.730 --> 15:16.610
Um, Herb, while there is a social stigma to this transaction,

15:16.610 --> 15:19.590
the big plus is these girls don't require any wining and dining.

15:19.590 --> 15:20.710
They just want to do the deed,

15:20.710 --> 15:22.590
then get as far away from us as they can.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.200
Really?

15:25.080 --> 15:26.250
Not even a Snapple?

15:27.910 --> 15:28.960
They're not thirsty, Herb.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.720
And you're paying them by the hour.

15:32.350 --> 15:33.780
Oh, okay.

15:33.780 --> 15:36.150
Well, I guess we should just, uh,

15:36.800 --> 15:39.860
go to the bedroom and, uh...

15:39.860 --> 15:43.070
Don't make me do this, Charlie.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.060
What are you talking about?

15:45.060 --> 15:46.190
This was your idea.

15:46.190 --> 15:46.960
I don't care.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.010
I'm not like you.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.570
I can't lay with whores.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.260
No offense.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.260
Where are you going?

15:54.330 --> 15:55.700
I love my wife!

15:55.760 --> 15:56.960
I want her back!

16:06.030 --> 16:08.060
All aboard?

16:14.530 --> 16:17.200
Sweetie, uh, you're humming again.

16:17.260 --> 16:18.600
Sorry.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.360
Don't know the words.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.460
Um, okay, uh, could you please not open your mouth so wide?

16:32.030 --> 16:33.460
Better now?

16:33.530 --> 16:35.030
Yeah, it's fine.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.600
Just, uh, can you not talk in my mouth?

16:38.800 --> 16:41.200
More rules than a public pool around here.

16:41.260 --> 16:42.330
They're not rules.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.960
It's just, uh, I know what I like,

16:44.030 --> 16:45.300
and you're not doing it.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.530
All right, fine, what, uh...

16:46.600 --> 16:47.630
what do you like, Judith?

16:47.700 --> 16:48.730
I have to tell you?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.730
No, no, let me guess and get yelled at.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.800
Nobody's yelling at you, Alan.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.300
-I'm not your mother.-Oh, you're right,

16:53.360 --> 16:55.960
my mother can emasculate me without raising her voice.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.600
Oh, God, I can't do this.

16:58.660 --> 17:01.160
-Do what? -I can't be with you again.

17:01.230 --> 17:04.030
I was afraid of being 40 years old and all by myself,

17:04.099 --> 17:07.500
but dying alone has got to be better than being stuck with you.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.660
Okay, now you're starting to sound like my mother.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.230
Judith, I love you.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.300
Please take me back.

17:15.359 --> 17:18.300
Oh, boy, this is awkward.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.400
Coming, darling.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.430
Get out of here.

17:23.829 --> 17:25.000
Oh, uh, just so we're clear,

17:25.060 --> 17:26.260
we've decided to see other people?

17:26.329 --> 17:27.700
Get out!

17:32.300 --> 17:33.630
Thanks for the ride, girls.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.330
And for bringing me home.

17:38.830 --> 17:42.400
* I've been working on the railroad *

17:42.460 --> 17:45.530
* All the livelong day *

17:45.600 --> 17:49.060
* Dinah won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow... *

17:49.130 --> 17:50.660
Hey, Alan.

17:52.260 --> 17:53.830
Mind if I join you?

17:53.900 --> 17:55.260
It's your house.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.200
Oh, yeah.

17:57.260 --> 17:58.660
Excuse me.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.830
Pardon me, hot soup.

18:05.860 --> 18:07.530
What the hell?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.300
Well, that's a little embarrassing.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.700
What is that?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.700
A railroad crossing sign.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.000
Sorry, I need more.

18:20.060 --> 18:22.630
I was having sex on a train set.

18:23.900 --> 18:28.200
How else do you get a crossing sign stuck to your ass?

18:28.260 --> 18:29.800
Of course.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.230
Hey, it could have been worse.

18:31.300 --> 18:34.430
I could have had a caboose in my caboose.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.830
Well, come on, that's funny.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.930
So, what happened when Herb showed up at Judith's house?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.260
How did you know about that?

18:44.330 --> 18:46.030
Lucky guess.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.400
She kicked me out again, Charlie.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.130
I had to sneak out her back door

18:51.200 --> 18:53.060
while she threw herself into Herb's arms.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.700
What's so funny?

18:56.760 --> 18:59.330
You said, "back door."

18:59.400 --> 19:01.960
That reminds me of my caboose joke.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.170
Good night.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.630
I'm here all week.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.130
Tip your waitresses.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.600
Hey, Mom, it's Charlie.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.760
Yeah, I know it's late.

19:22.830 --> 19:25.430
Listen, do you think this is funny?

19:29.830 --> 19:31.660
Must have got disconnected.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.560
Hey, Jake, you sleeping?

19:49.360 --> 19:50.730
-Doorbell. -Doorbell!

19:50.800 --> 19:52.100
Coming.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.160
Oh, hi, uh, thanks for bringing him over.

20:03.230 --> 20:04.430
Oh, no problem-- hey, guess what?

20:04.500 --> 20:06.800
Uh, Herb, why don't we let Jake tell him.

20:06.860 --> 20:07.900
Uh, tell me what?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.160
Jake?

20:09.230 --> 20:12.700
My grades aren't good enough for military school, so ha-ha.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.860
No, sweetheart, the other thing.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.830
I'm gonna have a little brother or sister.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.000
You're... you're pregnt?

20:24.060 --> 20:25.060
Yes, Alan.

20:25.130 --> 20:27.100
Herb and I are going to have a baby.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.830
Congratulations.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.330
Try to keep this one away from the lead paint.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.200
Did you hear that Alan?

20:35.260 --> 20:37.130
They've only been back together six weeks,

20:37.200 --> 20:39.400
and they're gonna have a baby.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.660
I heard.

20:42.730 --> 20:43.860
Come on in.

20:43.930 --> 20:45.160
We'll pop a bottle of champagne.

20:45.230 --> 20:46.400
Champagne.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.460
Uh, no, we really should be going.

20:48.530 --> 20:49.600
Come on, Herb.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.400
-Good-bye. -Ah, shoot.

20:52.430 --> 20:55.730
What a remarkable coincidence.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.460
Yeah, coincidence.

20:57.530 --> 20:59.430
-You okay? -No.

21:00.430 --> 21:02.230
Come on, let's sit you down.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.600
Yeah... let's sit me down.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.000
Here you go, buddy.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.800
Here I go.

21:11.860 --> 21:13.930
What's wrong with him?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.730
He's doing math in his head.

21:18.730 --> 21:20.240
Oh, yeah, that's a bitch.
