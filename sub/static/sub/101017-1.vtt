00:33.511 --> 00:34.904
Where you going, huh? Huh?

00:36.514 --> 00:37.950
- Huh, huh? Where you going? Where you going, huh?
- No.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.691
Where do you think you're going?
Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.741
You know, I always thought
you were better than us.

00:45.784 --> 00:50.528
Your father, all his little
whores, with your little bastards.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.791
And you thought we were
nothing but peasants.

00:54.489 --> 00:57.492
But we are Mexico.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.298
You were always
ashamed of us.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.782
Now, I'm going to
show you shame!

01:37.880 --> 01:39.751
You better open this door.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.059
Oh shit!

01:45.801 --> 01:46.845
Open the door.

02:07.692 --> 02:08.780
Uh!

02:13.220 --> 02:15.831
Where you going bitch,
huh? Where you going?

02:16.832 --> 02:21.184
Where do you think you're going, huh?
Huh? You think you could fuck with me?

02:21.228 --> 02:23.752
Huh? Is that what the
fuck you think or what? Huh?

02:24.231 --> 02:25.841
Let me tell you something, man.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.974
Huh? You think I'm envious? Ah?

02:29.018 --> 02:31.586
Well, I'll tell you what, there's
one thing I'm not fucking envious of

02:31.629 --> 02:32.978
and that's where
I'm sending you!

02:33.022 --> 02:34.719
Right where the
fuck you belong!

02:39.724 --> 02:41.422
That's right.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.207
Die! You're going to fucking
feel the pain right now.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.122
Stupid bitch, die!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.428
Fucking die!

03:04.967 --> 03:06.447
Fucking die!

03:33.343 --> 03:35.693
It's spring break weekend!

04:04.635 --> 04:07.290
You try that, you
fuck out of here.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.510
What's up, player?
There she come.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.773
What did you do baby boo?

04:11.816 --> 04:14.732
- Did you get the tickets?
- Guess who went with that stupid ass hat? First class, baby.

04:14.776 --> 04:18.040
- Oh my god! How did you afford that?
- Don't trip, man.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.172
After today, I'll be able
to afford a lot of things.

04:20.216 --> 04:24.046
- What's up? You ready?
- This girl with that stupid ass hat. I packed last night.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.309
- Pop the trunk.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:26.353 --> 04:29.399
I got mad shit in the trunk
already just put this in the back.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.445
Yo, Jamal!

04:31.488 --> 04:34.578
- What's good?
- You sure you and the homecoming queen won't change your mind?

04:34.622 --> 04:38.060
My pops is out of town this weekend,
I'm throwing the biggest bash of the year.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.670
You'll tell your kids
about it, brah.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.760
Let me think about
this real brief.

04:42.804 --> 04:46.416
First-class tickets to Cabo and a spot on
the beach, or hang out with your goofy ass

04:46.460 --> 04:49.114
and watch you pop Molly's all weekend and
wonder why you can't get your shit up.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.641
- Why don't you blow me, man?
- I don't know Jamal.

04:53.684 --> 04:57.471
If he's got what I think he's got,
he might be getting some this weekend.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.299
You fucking tease.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.170
I know, right?

05:01.213 --> 05:02.867
Yeah, what you think K? You think we
should dead this whole Cabo business

05:02.911 --> 05:06.567
- and hang with Brandon the BBLC crew?
- Hmm, that's a toughy.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.568
Bye, Felipe.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.874
You heard her. That part.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.225
Bye, Felicia.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.924
Bye babe. Have fun. We love you.

05:20.102 --> 05:23.323
I hope your plane goes down in the
Amazon common-looking anteater.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.498
Fuck you.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.459
Oh my god! We're going
to have the best night.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.113
I'm literally so excited.

05:31.156 --> 05:34.986
- Do we have any alcohol?
- Straight back, bitches!

06:09.586 --> 06:11.632
Driver, do you know
why I pulled you over?

06:20.336 --> 06:23.948
Would you believe I have a perfectly
logical explanation for that, Officer?

06:27.212 --> 06:32.435
Since this is your first offense, Miss
Gates, and since it was not your vehicle,

06:33.305 --> 06:36.091
and you claimed to have no knowledge
of the contents of said vehicle,

06:36.134 --> 06:38.920
and you passed
a polygraph test.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.791
That corroborates
your statement.

06:41.488 --> 06:44.578
Now, the court would normally be
inclined to be lenient in this matter.

06:44.621 --> 06:48.277
However, seeing as how the
contraband was in such a large amount

06:48.320 --> 06:51.585
so as to fall into the
category of intent to distribute

06:52.194 --> 06:56.067
and despite the council's familiarity with
the court, I feel it's a part of my job

06:56.111 --> 06:57.721
when I pass a sentence.

06:59.984 --> 07:03.423
It is to help teach young people a lesson so
this type of thing does not happen again.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.467
Are you with me?

07:06.251 --> 07:10.821
Therefore, I am sentencing you
to three months of house arrest.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.695
Where you will be required to wear
an ankle bracelet at all times

07:14.738 --> 07:17.611
to ensure you do not leave
your parent's residence.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.832
Miss Gates, please understand that
even though you have not been issued

07:21.876 --> 07:23.443
this ankle bracelet as of yet,

07:24.008 --> 07:26.881
confinement restrictions begin immediately.
Are we clear?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.449
Yes, Sir.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.321
The court will schedule a time to
apply the mandated monitoring device

07:32.364 --> 07:33.627
within five business days.

07:33.670 --> 07:38.675
Miss Gates, be mindful
of who you associate with.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.765
It could cost you your freedom.

07:45.203 --> 07:48.598
However, in your
case, Mr. Washington,

07:49.294 --> 07:51.166
the car you were driving
was, in fact, your own,

07:51.209 --> 07:53.342
and you were driving under
the influence of marijuana,

07:53.821 --> 07:57.564
the amount of marijuana found in the trunk
of your vehicle was substantially more

07:57.607 --> 08:00.915
than enough to fall under the
category of intent to distribute.

08:01.568 --> 08:06.703
Although you claimed that you too as well had
no knowledge of what was in your vehicle.

08:07.399 --> 08:10.402
That would be of no concern
to me in my court.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.406
"Why would that not matter in
your courtroom, Your Honor?"

08:14.450 --> 08:21.065
I'll tell you why? I have no tolerance
or patience for drug dealers, simple.

08:22.763 --> 08:25.200
And as far as I am concerned for
first offense that just means

08:25.243 --> 08:27.158
you haven't been caught before.

08:27.202 --> 08:31.119
So, I am sentencing you to five years
in the California State Penitentiary

08:31.162 --> 08:32.033
effective immediately.

08:34.426 --> 08:38.561
Your Honor, if we could beg the court for
seventy-two-hour stay, so my client could get his house

08:38.605 --> 08:40.302
in order and say
goodbye to his family,

08:40.868 --> 08:42.826
I assure you
he's not a flight risk.

08:42.870 --> 08:43.871
Denied.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.568
Your Honor,

08:47.091 --> 08:49.529
I've known this
young man all his life.

08:51.008 --> 08:54.925
I will sign for him myself
and if it pleases the court,

08:55.709 --> 08:59.277
if he doesn't show up Monday,
I will never come in this courtroom again.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.062
Councilor,

09:02.672 --> 09:04.674
are you threatening
me with a two-for-one?

09:04.718 --> 09:07.242
Because if this means there's
even the slightest chance

09:07.895 --> 09:11.420
that you're never walk into my courtroom
again, I will take you up on that.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.422
Perhaps it might be worth it.

09:13.465 --> 09:18.514
Granted. Defender will appear Monday
morning for processing at 7:00 a.m.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.124
Court is dismissed.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.517
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.521
Come here, let's go.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.835
Uh, can't believe that asshole
gave Jamal five years.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.054
I can't believe you're going
to have a criminal record.

09:37.098 --> 09:40.057
Do you have any idea what an impact that's
going to have on the rest of your life?

09:40.623 --> 09:43.104
Mom, it's nothing.
It's just house arrest.

09:43.147 --> 09:47.630
Just admit it you're bummed because you
might not be able to go to Miami with Ted.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.589
Uh, the hell I won't.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.113
You think your little trick is going
to keep me from my trip in Miami?

09:52.156 --> 09:54.376
You have another thing coming.

09:54.419 --> 09:57.335
- But the judge just said...
- I don't give a rat's ass about what the judge just said,

09:57.379 --> 09:59.424
you're on house arrest, not me.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.644
That stupid son of a bitch is
not going to know where I go,

10:01.688 --> 10:04.691
but he will know where
you go and so will I.

10:04.734 --> 10:08.999
- What do you mean?
- Ted and I hired a live-in to keep an eye on you.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.958
Fresh off the boat from Mexico.

10:11.001 --> 10:14.048
How did you know I wasn't going to...
I don't know, maybe go to jail?

10:14.091 --> 10:17.791
You need to wake up and smell the
coffee, Kimmy. Everybody has a price.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.662
Even justice is for sale.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.621
You'll meet Sara in the house.

10:22.665 --> 10:26.713
Wait, so you're telling me you could
have had Jamal's sentence reduced?

10:26.756 --> 10:30.151
And run the risk of you raising
in a nappy haired little child?

10:31.065 --> 10:31.892
No chance.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.678
You know there's a word for people
with a name like Jamal Washington,

10:36.723 --> 10:38.115
it rhymes with trigger.

10:40.857 --> 10:41.902
Wow.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.688
The only thing you're
missing is a white sheet.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.951
Oh, don't play the race
card with me missy.

10:47.995 --> 10:52.216
He's a drug dealer and jail is
where drug dealers belong.

10:53.435 --> 10:56.960
So, you're going to be in Miami while I'm
just stuck at home with a fricking live-in.

10:57.004 --> 11:00.137
I don't want to come home to a
house that looks like Justin Bieber,

11:00.181 --> 11:02.357
Amanda Bynes and Miley
Cyrus had a threesome in it.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.054
Oh, mom.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.708
Besides, it doesn't
cost that much.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.058
They make like
five dollars a month.

11:08.102 --> 11:12.062
She'll just be excited not to have to be selling
oranges on the side of the 101 freeway.

11:19.461 --> 11:22.464
Mom, come on. You know
I don't need a live-in.

11:22.507 --> 11:25.902
And you're not one to just bring
in stray dogs from the street.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.556
She's not a stray dog, honey.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.818
She's a Mexican.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.343
You're the one who went to the
dark side hanging out with Kanye.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.084
It's Jamal, mom.

11:36.173 --> 11:39.742
Whatever! You know as well as I do that
once you go black, you're a single mom.

11:39.786 --> 11:45.139
Oh my god! Can you just take me home, please?
I can't take your racist ass anymore.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.750
Oh, you're going home, sweetie.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.970
That's the only place
you're allowed to be.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.062
Disrespectful little shit,
trying to ruin my vacation.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.099
Mr. Gates,
there's a call for you.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.275
Pastor Gates.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.063
Hi, daddy.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.023
Kimmy!

12:43.066 --> 12:44.938
One more, dad.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.375
Okay. One last time. Okay, Kim?

12:48.028 --> 12:48.637
What am I?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.422
Charlie, Charlie.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
- What did you say to me?
- Nothing.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.297
- Why you lying to me?
- I'm not lying, dad.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.168
Oh, no.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.518
No.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.956
- No.
- Dad?

13:02.999 --> 13:04.044
No, this can't be happening.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.788
- Dad what's wrong?
- I thought I killed you.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.616
Mom, mom!

13:11.660 --> 13:14.489
- Honey, what's all the shouting about?
- Something's wrong with dad.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.012
What do you mean
something's wrong with dad?

13:16.056 --> 13:18.493
Look, something's
wrong with him.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.888
Sweetheart, why don't you go up to
your room and play a video game?

13:21.931 --> 13:23.585
I'll be there in just
a minute, okay?

13:23.628 --> 13:26.675
- But mom, what about dad?
- Sweetie, dad's going to be fine.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.285
- Go to your room.
- Okay.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.374
Richard,

13:31.898 --> 13:32.855
who are you talking to?

13:33.421 --> 13:34.901
I will kill you.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.033
Kill who?

13:40.689 --> 13:42.647
Richard, you have to stop this.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.869
You're scaring Kim
and you're scaring me.

13:46.913 --> 13:50.003
You've been strange ever since you
came back from that trip to Mexico.

13:51.395 --> 13:52.614
- Honey.
- What?

13:54.050 --> 13:55.008
Honey.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.444
Talk to me.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.620
Please.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.318
What's going on?

14:02.624 --> 14:03.930
Watch this bump here.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.770
Mommy, where
are they taking him?

14:21.948 --> 14:23.036
It's okay.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.865
Down on three.
One, two, three.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.884
When is he coming home?

14:46.276 --> 14:49.105
Honey, daddy has
to go get better.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.197
He's coming for you.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.678
Daddy, who's coming?

14:57.244 --> 14:58.245
Evil.

14:58.767 --> 14:59.942
What evil?

15:00.769 --> 15:02.205
He's coming for you.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.034
What?

15:05.774 --> 15:09.082
You can only stop evil
where the lines cross.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.519
What are you talking about?

15:12.085 --> 15:13.521
Where the lines cross.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.480
You can only stop evil
where the lines cross.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.700
I don't understand.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.529
You can only defeat evil
where the lines cross.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.357
Where the lines cross!

15:23.400 --> 15:25.272
Where the lines cross!

15:25.315 --> 15:28.014
You can only defeat evil where the
lines cross! Where the lines cross!

15:28.057 --> 15:32.279
Mr. Gates, you're having
a bit of an episode.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.281
I need you to calm down.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.369
Calm down.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.067
You're just having
a bit of an episode.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.199
I'll take that.

15:41.070 --> 15:44.247
I'm so sorry, miss, your father's
just having a bit of an episode.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.902
I've never heard
him talk like that.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.904
I wouldn't take anything
he's saying seriously.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.341
He's really not in a
good place right now.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.735
He's never in a good
place when he's in there.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.745
Poor daddy.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.791
Bitch! I saw you cheating.
Stop playing with me!

16:07.444 --> 16:10.012
Oh my god. I'd never cheat.
Why would you think I was cheating?

16:10.056 --> 16:12.449
Bitch! You're always cheating!
I'm not a cheater.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.278
I... was... she-she...
Oh my god.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.845
You see how white
people treat us?

16:16.888 --> 16:19.239
Uh-huh, get off me.
Uh-huh. Get off of me!

16:30.728 --> 16:31.991
Kim, run!

16:46.657 --> 16:48.311
I'm coming for you.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.394
Hello.

17:27.436 --> 17:30.005
I can't believe I'm going to be
on house arrest all summer.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.615
<i>What the fuck you
mean house arrest?</i>

17:31.659 --> 17:33.269
I was going to the
NBA next year,

17:33.313 --> 17:35.880
now I'm about to do five fucking
years up state in the pen.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.013
I know. I still
can't believe it.

17:38.666 --> 17:39.710
When do you go in?

17:41.147 --> 17:42.974
That fat ass judge said I get
processed on Monday.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.977
- Well that does still leave us the weekend, right?
- <i>I guess, babe.</i>

17:46.500 --> 17:48.676
So, listen, I'm kind of fucked
up right now, you know.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.678
Let's just make the best
of the time we have.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.333
Still all I got is
seventy-two hours.

17:53.376 --> 17:56.771
Well, you do you want me to give you
something to remember me by right?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.035
I mean, I guess.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.733
You know I'll wait for you.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.344
We'll talk about that
shit when I see you.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.347
- Yeah and that will be...
- About an hour.

18:08.565 --> 18:12.569
- What? You're coming over?
- <i>Yeah, I got to run in, make it real quick</i>

18:12.613 --> 18:14.136
and then I'm going
to head over.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.269
Okay, yeah. Text me
when you're outside.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.574
All right. For sure.

18:22.318 --> 18:23.363
Ugh!

18:30.239 --> 18:31.980
Well, that's one
way to get likes.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.374
Oh my god, Ted.
Can't you fucking knock?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.637
Ow! I'm not even looking.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.508
I can't even see anymore.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.469
Okay, listen. Your mom and I
are going to Audi5000, okay?

18:42.512 --> 18:44.732
So I want you to meet
the new live-in we got you.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.821
Oh, really? The live-in
was your idea?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.434
You're not nervous that some strange bitch is
going to be in our house and rob us blind?

18:51.478 --> 18:54.481
Okay, she's standing right here.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.483
She can hear everything
you're saying.

18:56.526 --> 18:57.832
Come here, sweetheart.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.877
Come here, girl.
Come here, honey.

18:59.921 --> 19:03.794
Okay, she's going to be watching over
you for the weekend while we're gone.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.231
Sara.

19:06.754 --> 19:09.713
Are you fucking kidding me?
This is our live-in, Ted?

19:09.757 --> 19:12.455
She's my age. Where'd you find
her? Backpage.com?

19:12.499 --> 19:16.633
Back page? Back page?
Tinder, okay?

19:16.677 --> 19:19.158
I swiped left twice
and I found Sara.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.421
Okay, I'm lying.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.945
I was at Home Depot picking up some
double-A batteries and some cock

19:23.988 --> 19:25.555
for your mother, all right.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.950
And then there was Sara.
She said, "Hey." I said, "Sex."

19:28.993 --> 19:31.561
What a deal? Okay, so you
guys get acquainted.

19:31.605 --> 19:34.651
All right. I'll let you guys
finger, finger, finger it out.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.653
Finger her.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.440
I don't know how you say it in
Spanish, I'll finger-ito, okay?

19:40.483 --> 19:41.963
Finger-ito?

19:42.006 --> 19:44.618
Ted, get the fuck
out of my room!

19:44.661 --> 19:47.751
I'm going to Miami, okay?
So, I'll see you guys later. All right?

19:47.795 --> 19:50.101
I'm going to turn up.
We turn up.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.364
Bottle service, bitch!

19:51.407 --> 19:54.018
Woo! Daddy's on vacation.

19:57.587 --> 19:58.545
I can't.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.111
I fucking can't.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.114
I don't understand.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.421
- You can't do what?
- Deal, bitch.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.685
I have some chick that should be working
at a T-Bell, standing in my fucking room

20:08.729 --> 20:10.905
and you don't understand
how this is awkward?

20:18.521 --> 20:20.262
Hurry up, Ted.
We're losing light.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.309
Oh, goodbye, my little convict.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.919
Please don't burn
my house down.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.790
Here's some money
in case you need it.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.838
I should remind you, you have a
curfew and confinement restrictions,

20:30.881 --> 20:33.971
but if you violate it you go to jail.
So, I'm sure I don't need to.

20:34.015 --> 20:34.885
Love you.

20:34.929 --> 20:35.930
Mean it.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.238
Peace out, girl scout.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.239
Don't say that.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.636
Seriously?

21:04.785 --> 21:05.829
Oh, my God.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.397
Jamal, I am so happy.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.181
- You actually came really...
- Fast?

21:10.225 --> 21:12.314
Oh, my God.

21:12.358 --> 21:16.536
The word is fast, but, perhaps, I can
introduce you to another word, "delivery",

21:16.579 --> 21:19.974
because in the next seventy-two hours
you're going to have to face the fact

21:20.017 --> 21:24.500
that if you're not coming to Spring
Break, Spring Break is coming to you.

21:26.850 --> 21:30.071
Brandon, what are you doing here and how did
you not get caught by my mom and that perv?

21:30.114 --> 21:34.554
What do you take me for? A rookie? I mean
it's your ass that's on house arrest.

21:35.381 --> 21:39.602
So, I made an executive decision and
I'm calling for a change of venue.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.690
Young.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.257
Yo!

21:43.171 --> 21:45.478
We got like ten kegs
in the truck and...

21:45.521 --> 21:47.958
...how about your shit that
we're going to set up then?

21:48.002 --> 21:49.873
So, are we cool to do this,
bitch here, or what?

21:49.917 --> 21:54.530
Are you guys serious right now?
Okay, you guys are like the best ever.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.315
Who all knows about this?

21:56.358 --> 21:59.361
What? Are you serious?

21:59.405 --> 22:01.407
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:02.277 --> 22:05.585
What the heck?
You guys all... hi.

22:05.628 --> 22:11.504
And introducing from badlands
Calabasas, originally from BFE Indiana,

22:11.547 --> 22:14.681
my best friend and captain
of the basketball team,

22:14.724 --> 22:20.730
recently drafted by the Maricopa
County Correctional Facility for men,

22:20.774 --> 22:24.168
Jamal Washington!

22:26.910 --> 22:28.477
Oh my god.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.174
I can't believe it.

22:32.481 --> 22:35.136
What you mean, girl? You got to kill me to
keep me away from your sweet ass this weekend.

22:35.745 --> 22:39.706
I'm about to go away on for show about
three months. And you do know that.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.752
Hi, what's happening.
Look at this bitch.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.928
Let's switch on this
weekend. Y'all ready?

22:44.972 --> 22:46.103
Okay, y'all.

22:48.279 --> 22:53.415
And now, introducing the starting
lineups for tonight's house party

22:53.459 --> 22:57.593
busting all the way from Trump
University the English girl I know,

22:57.637 --> 23:02.076
with a professional bitch slapping
record of 11 wins, 0 losses.

23:02.119 --> 23:06.254
She's knocked out five chicks cause she's
from Northern California Slap-a-hoe Trap.

23:06.297 --> 23:09.388
Jasmine Sanchez.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.174
Yo, girl.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.567
Okay.

23:15.263 --> 23:18.266
Fuck she's so good,
she can dance like that.

23:18.832 --> 23:19.789
Okay.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.097
Yes!

23:26.492 --> 23:31.279
And coming to you fresh off the short
bus with a makeover that's so good,

23:31.322 --> 23:35.152
that she's kept me celibate for a
year cause she said I'd be her first.

23:35.196 --> 23:40.723
To the one girl that wouldn't give
it up to anybody, Laurie Simm.

23:53.475 --> 23:56.391
And last but not least,
the dynamic duo.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.480
This couple needs
no introduction.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.525
We're not a couple.

23:59.568 --> 24:04.965
Sean Philip and
Rachel Kardashian.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.140
Origami.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.098
It's Ormanani, you fuckers.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.492
Yeah, whatever.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.887
Yeah, that's what I'm talking
about, baby. Fuck it up.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.629
Get out of here. Spring Break.
What's happening? Fuck it up.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.109
That's my boy.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.590
- Hey, what about me?
- What about you, bro?

24:21.634 --> 24:25.246
If you're not teaching me karate or doing
my math homework or washing my clothes,

24:25.289 --> 24:26.813
I have no use for you.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.425
You know what, Brando?
Go eat a pack of dicks.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.905
Oh!

24:31.948 --> 24:34.908
In fact, why don't you go
eat a double bag of dicks.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.300
Oh!

24:37.867 --> 24:40.043
Exactly how many dicks are
in a single bag of dicks, Young?

24:40.087 --> 24:42.785
And if they're Asian, does that
mean they have baby dicks or not?

24:42.829 --> 24:45.701
So, does that mean you need
four bags of Asian dicks

24:45.745 --> 24:48.878
to be equivalent to two
bags of regular dicks?

24:48.922 --> 24:51.359
So, you're saying a
quintuple bag of dicks?

24:51.402 --> 24:52.969
A quintuple bag of dicks?

24:53.013 --> 24:54.884
A smorgasbord of sausage.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.059
A surplus of schlong.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.931
A pile of penises.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.149
So, like a plethora?

24:59.193 --> 25:01.325
So, basically like a
cornucopia of dicks.

25:01.369 --> 25:04.415
In fact, what's the math
on a busload of dicks?

25:04.851 --> 25:07.984
What exactly is a bag of dicks?

25:08.028 --> 25:11.292
Who the fuck exactly is that?

25:11.335 --> 25:14.687
I forgot. That's the live-in
the perv got off Backpage.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.776
And she looks like that?

25:16.819 --> 25:20.431
Which one of them bitches is telling her
she's getting this medium dick later?

25:20.997 --> 25:23.783
Yo, man I swear this goofy motherfucker
right here is going to tuck himself

25:23.826 --> 25:25.915
right into some pussy body
right into the night watch.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.700
Facts.

25:27.743 --> 25:31.486
You know what? You, plus you,
plus this motherfucker right here,

25:31.530 --> 25:33.575
get on suck these nu...

26:02.909 --> 26:04.432
I got the Molly, yo.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.825
Yeah, man. Yeah, yeah.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.871
Yeah, you want to get.
I can give you a bump.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.003
Would you like some?

26:20.535 --> 26:21.928
Let me show you something.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.625
- What's that? Where are we going?
- Come here.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.192
Don't worry about it.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.985
You know I'll wait
for you, right?

26:37.204 --> 26:38.466
Yo, don't say that.

26:40.686 --> 26:44.515
What? You don't think I could do it? You
don't think I could wait five years for you?

26:45.560 --> 26:49.129
I don't think that part will let you
wait five months, let alone five years.

26:50.957 --> 26:55.831
This five-year shit is real and when I
get out, you're not going to remember me.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.095
I'm going to be just be another
convict fresh out of the pan.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.837
And how am I supposed to fit
into the picture then, huh?

27:01.881 --> 27:02.664
Exactly.

27:05.145 --> 27:08.670
Now, the truth is, I tried
to take a shortcut,

27:08.714 --> 27:11.412
hit a leg and my life is never
going to be the same again.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.634
So, let's not get it twisted and let's
make everything we can out of right now

27:16.112 --> 27:19.507
cause as far as I'm concerned,
right now is all we got.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.391
- What the...
- Sorry I... I didn't know.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.003
You didn't know what, you stupid bitch?
What the fuck are you even doing here?

27:37.046 --> 27:38.831
I was just trying to clean up.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.920
Clean up? Clean up what?

27:40.963 --> 27:44.532
God, doesn't anyone ever
fucking knock? Get out.

27:44.575 --> 27:48.579
Oh, chill, babe. What's the matter
with you? She's just trying to help.

27:48.623 --> 27:49.624
Now come here, ma.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.322
She didn't mean it.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.629
Yeah, when did you get here
anyway? It's your first day?

27:57.806 --> 28:00.504
You know, I ain't going to see
nothing like this for five years.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.984
You want to take a sip?

28:09.513 --> 28:13.082
Now why don't you come over
here and be nice to Sara.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.649
Take a sip.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.737
Jamal.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.217
Yo, I'm about to go away.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.740
So tonight, I want it all

28:18.784 --> 28:20.916
So let me get this right.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.615
You're using the fact that your ass is going
to jail on Monday to justify being okay

28:24.659 --> 28:30.143
to hook up with me and the Mexican here at the
same time? You're out of your fucking mind.

28:30.186 --> 28:33.233
Both of you can get
the fuck out of my room.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.713
Yeah, come on.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.757
Let's go.

28:35.801 --> 28:36.932
This is no fun.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.456
We have to build the wall.

29:14.013 --> 29:17.016
Where's them girls
with the big butts?

29:22.369 --> 29:24.458
Who wants some Molly?

29:24.501 --> 29:25.720
Whoo!

29:27.287 --> 29:30.420
I said, who wants some Molly?

29:48.787 --> 29:52.225
Yo, what the fuck is up
with Young tonight?

29:52.268 --> 29:53.704
I can't feel my face.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.185
I can't feel my face!

29:56.882 --> 29:58.448
I love it!

29:59.319 --> 30:02.104
Yo, that boy is out of a
giraffe pussy. Look at him.

30:02.148 --> 30:05.020
Look at him. He's crazy. Look at the way
his fucking eyes are spinning like...

30:05.064 --> 30:06.369
Look at those
beady ass eyes.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.414
He's going to dilate.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.851
I'm like take him
to the hospital.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.419
- He's fucking dead.
- Man that's your boy, bother.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.377
I'm catching a Uber.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.336
I'm catching an Uber and why the
fuck aren't you staying here tonight?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.085
There's my boys.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.000
There's my boys right there.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.177
Hey, if nobody knows Jamal
Washington is going to jail.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.570
He just fucking put you on, bro.

30:33.614 --> 30:36.835
He got busted with weed and I'm on
Molly right now. And I'm chilling.

32:02.268 --> 32:05.358
Yo, put some hair
on your left beat.

32:05.401 --> 32:06.446
Yeah, okay.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.069
Shut this party down now.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.724
- What the fuck?
- You have a problem with that, big boy?

32:25.682 --> 32:26.988
No, you don't.

32:31.819 --> 32:34.517
This BBOC shit fucking sucks.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.434
All right, let's
get out of here.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.481
Hey.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.053
We're crashing the ball game.
This party sucks.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.315
I'm coming too.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.935
- I thought there were going to be drugs here.
- Yo, man.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.981
Jamal said bring that
bitch to the living room.

33:06.854 --> 33:11.076
Damn, she must have some stuff on that
bikini because that ass is calling me.

33:13.730 --> 33:14.862
Hello.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.517
Hey.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.563
- So, what happened to that other girl?
- I told that bitch to beat it.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.653
Oh, yeah? Well, come
in here and beat it.

33:23.697 --> 33:26.004
Call me Barry Bonds.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.884
Damn!

33:37.537 --> 33:39.582
- You're going to take of your clothes first?
- Now, it's my turn.

33:39.626 --> 33:42.759
Your turn? Let me
see it. Let me see it.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.587
Oh, look at that.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.244
Yeah, the alarm ass here.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.351
Are you fucking kidding
me right now?

34:10.873 --> 34:14.268
- Oh!
- Really? With these two bitches?

34:15.661 --> 34:16.924
Fuck boy, please.

34:19.143 --> 34:20.580
All right.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.119
<i>Shut this party down now.</i>

34:38.163 --> 34:39.947
Oh shit!

34:39.989 --> 34:43.081
I told Jas this party was
going to get shut down.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.911
<i>♪ Can you hear me now? ♪</i>

34:49.652 --> 34:50.697
Shit.

34:51.654 --> 34:55.136
<i>♪ Can you hear me now? ♪</i>

34:55.179 --> 35:00.185
<i>♪ Can you, can you, can you? ♪</i>

35:00.228 --> 35:02.274
Yo, Jas, Jas.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.102
What?

35:04.145 --> 35:05.842
What'd I tell you?

35:05.886 --> 35:08.193
That you're an idiot and
you failed summer school.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.586
No, fuck me.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.589
This BBOC party got shut down.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.331
That part. Let me see it.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.336
<i>Shut this party down now!</i>

35:21.380 --> 35:23.599
Oh, my god.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.999
- Yo, would you please just talk to me?
- I don't got shit to say.

35:32.042 --> 35:33.479
- Oh, it's like that?
- Yeah.

35:33.957 --> 35:35.568
Guess my mom
wasn't crazy after all.

35:35.611 --> 35:38.527
Just like you said,
Jamal, it is what it is.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.314
I'm just scared of what
lies ahead for me.

35:42.357 --> 35:45.839
You should have been scared when you was
playing with them to ratchet ass bitches.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.538
I'm wrong.

35:50.757 --> 35:51.801
I'm just scared.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.196
Keep thinking I'm going to wake up
and realize this is all a dream.

35:56.676 --> 36:00.027
I don't want to do this right
now, okay? Let's just

36:00.070 --> 36:02.508
go meet everyone
and we'll talk later.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.162
For right now,

36:05.424 --> 36:07.426
stay the fuck out of my face.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.695
- Man, this sucks. What do we do now?
- Man.

36:15.738 --> 36:18.263
punk-ass police always
hanging sundown parties.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.135
Dude, they took my DJ equipment.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.441
We could play a game.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.969
Have you ever heard
of "Charlie Charlie"?

36:29.535 --> 36:32.799
Play a game? My party's all-over
fucking YouTube for being lame

36:32.842 --> 36:34.496
and you're talking
about playing a game?

36:34.540 --> 36:37.151
Kim, it might actually be fun.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.239
Let's hear her out.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.284
I'm down.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.590
Fuck it, let's turn up.

36:41.634 --> 36:44.158
We have nothing
else to do. I'm in.

36:44.898 --> 36:50.947
- Guys, where's Brandon?
- Brandon is in the b... I'm going to go find Brandon.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.429
You know what?
I'm going to help you.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.135
- What are you holding?
- Nothing.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.225
Let me see it.

37:17.060 --> 37:21.587
The legend of Charlie is about the
little boy who never went to church

37:21.630 --> 37:27.549
and because he never went to church and he
hid from God his sins were never cleansed.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.944
So more and more
as the years went by,

37:31.510 --> 37:34.817
he began to be consumed by all his
sins, until one day,

37:35.601 --> 37:37.385
on his 13th birthday

37:37.429 --> 37:40.954
his soul was possessed
by all seven of the deadly sins

37:40.997 --> 37:43.261
and he was driven mad forever.

37:43.826 --> 37:48.048
Even after his death, the local
villagers would see signs of Charlie

37:48.091 --> 37:50.311
when the blue house
would summon him.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.314
The legend says he waits
for sinners to summon him

37:54.184 --> 37:58.624
so he can consume their souls
with the poison of their own sin.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.540
Oh, I heard about this. It's that
thing that was trending online, right?

38:01.583 --> 38:02.976
You guys, it's stupid.

38:03.019 --> 38:04.804
It's like the poor man's
version of a Ouija board.

38:04.847 --> 38:09.069
No, it is a very serious
thing in my country.

38:09.112 --> 38:13.639
Wow, and I thought this whole Charlie
Charlie thing was just an Internet hoax.

38:13.682 --> 38:16.903
Apart from a hoax, if you
break the rules of the game,

38:16.946 --> 38:19.601
Charlie will creep into
the souls of all of you.

38:20.254 --> 38:22.691
Yeah, because Charlie's
totally a demon.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.606
A Mexican demon, right?

38:25.651 --> 38:27.261
How do we play?

38:27.957 --> 38:31.352
Every one of us has a sin that
dominates their personality.

38:32.179 --> 38:37.750
Envy, wrath, greed, sloth,

38:38.403 --> 38:43.277
gluttony, lust and pride.

38:44.017 --> 38:46.324
Seven deadly sins.

38:46.367 --> 38:50.371
The things we tried to stop ourselves
from doing, but can't seem to control.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.679
When the soul of Charlie is
summoned, the challenge begins.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.378
Overcome your sin
or be consumed by it.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.685
Okay, what happens
if you overcome it?

39:00.207 --> 39:01.513
Charlie takes it from you.

39:03.776 --> 39:08.128
His soul bears the weight of it in purgatory
and you're free from that sin forever.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.043
- Wow.
- That's cool.

39:10.086 --> 39:11.958
Okay. What happens if you don't?

39:12.437 --> 39:13.612
You die from it.

39:15.178 --> 39:17.703
Come on, man. That's bullshit.

39:17.746 --> 39:20.880
Of course, it's total
bullshit. But, honestly,

39:20.923 --> 39:23.665
kind of sounds fun and plus
what else are we going to do?

39:23.709 --> 39:25.145
Hey, I'm not the one
on house arrest.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.277
I can leave whenever
the fuck I want.

39:28.017 --> 39:31.543
Okay, well I want to be free
from all my food cravings.

39:31.586 --> 39:36.112
What's that, gluttony? If I can
get rid of that shit, I'm game.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.287
Let's play.

39:37.331 --> 39:38.637
What are the rules?

39:38.680 --> 39:41.814
Rule number one, you
need seven players to play.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.163
One for every sin.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.384
I guess that makes sense.

39:46.427 --> 39:49.169
Well, there's seven of us,
looks like we have just enough.

39:49.212 --> 39:54.130
Eight of us. Guys, I may be
higher than shit, but I'm Asian.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.915
I'm good at math.
There's eight of us here.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.917
No, Young there are seven of us.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.136
You don't fucking count.
Go get us some food.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.050
What do you guys want?

40:01.094 --> 40:02.400
- Fries.
- Sushi!

40:02.443 --> 40:03.836
Chicken.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.838
- Spaghetti.
- Yo, fuck that. Get us Chinese food.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.317
Yes!

40:07.361 --> 40:10.190
Hey, that's racist, but I could
go for orange chicken.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.410
I'll be right back, guys.

40:12.453 --> 40:15.848
I'm going to get a whole platter of all orange
chicken, Chow Mein, and fortune cookies.

40:15.891 --> 40:18.590
They're going to say,
"Suck on his Chinese nuts."

40:18.633 --> 40:21.593
Does this fucker realize
he's not wearing any pants?

40:30.732 --> 40:34.997
Rule number two, you can only
ask yes or no questions.

40:35.041 --> 40:40.394
Rule number three, don't ever drop
the pencils while you're playing.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.353
- How come?
- Oh my god, give me this.

40:43.397 --> 40:45.965
Um, okay rule number three,

40:47.270 --> 40:52.493
don't let the pencils hit the ground
cause if they do the game cannot end.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.539
Okay, well what if you
want the game to end?

40:55.061 --> 40:57.106
I mean, what if you don't
want to start it at all?

40:57.150 --> 41:00.196
You can only leave the
game if you ask permission.

41:01.981 --> 41:05.506
OMG, guys,
I'm like so freaking scared right now.

41:05.550 --> 41:09.075
Ooh, evil spirits. Oh, no!

41:09.118 --> 41:10.772
They're coming
for your ass first.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.819
And they're going to meet me
in your mama's house, bro.

41:14.297 --> 41:16.212
Okay, guys.

41:16.256 --> 41:21.957
Number four, you must always, always,
ask permission to leave the game.

41:22.001 --> 41:23.611
And if you don't?

41:23.655 --> 41:26.135
All right, guys, I don't know
that this is such a good idea.

41:26.179 --> 41:28.529
I mean summoning evil spirits
and everything, come on.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.400
Oh my god, Laurie.
Shut the fuck up.

41:30.444 --> 41:32.054
Oh, come on. Let's just play.

41:32.664 --> 41:35.754
We need to hold hands
and I will say this phrase.

41:40.672 --> 41:45.154
"Death is struck
and nature quaking.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.375
All creation is awakening.

41:48.418 --> 41:55.556
Whatever heights will appear,
God becomes evil, faith becomes fear."

41:59.473 --> 42:02.084
- What the fuck?
- No way.

42:02.128 --> 42:04.913
- Did you see that see that?
- See what?

42:04.957 --> 42:07.742
These nuts? Got him.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.918
Come on, the wind blew it.

42:09.962 --> 42:12.181
What wind, bro?
There's no wind in here.

42:12.225 --> 42:14.096
Really?

42:15.315 --> 42:17.230
Jamal, stop.

42:17.273 --> 42:18.274
I'll go first.

42:18.666 --> 42:21.103
Charlie, Charlie.
Can you hear me?

42:21.756 --> 42:23.410
Charlie, Charlie.

42:23.453 --> 42:24.890
Are you here?

42:24.933 --> 42:26.761
You guys don't really believe
in this shit, are you?

42:28.197 --> 42:29.808
I believe in spirits.

42:29.851 --> 42:32.375
Yeah, and you still believe
in fucking Santa Claus.

42:32.419 --> 42:34.856
Wait, you fucked Santa?

42:37.293 --> 42:38.599
Ho, ho, ho.

42:43.473 --> 42:44.997
It has begun.

42:45.650 --> 42:48.217
Remember, overcome your sin

42:49.523 --> 42:50.916
or die from it.

42:51.394 --> 42:52.134
R?

42:53.919 --> 42:55.137
- What the fuck you mean?
- All right, I'm about done with this.

42:55.181 --> 42:57.400
Yeah, I second the shit
out of that motion.

42:57.444 --> 43:00.360
Fellas, chill. I got a
yes-or-no question.

43:00.403 --> 43:01.666
Hey, yo, Charlie.

43:01.709 --> 43:04.146
- Do I die tonight?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

43:04.190 --> 43:06.148
- Why the fuck would you ask that?
- Fuck.

43:06.192 --> 43:08.673
Yo, babe, stop being so naive.

43:08.716 --> 43:10.631
The only thing that's
really going on right now

43:10.675 --> 43:12.981
is we're sitting here talking
to a couple of fucking pencils.

43:13.025 --> 43:17.812
You expect me to be afraid of a ghost
named fucking Charlie? That's a Mexican?

43:17.856 --> 43:19.988
A Mexican ghost?

43:23.035 --> 43:25.124
I mean, come on, really?

43:25.167 --> 43:28.997
Maybe if his name was like Carlos or Pablo
and Dirty Sanchez or some shit like that

43:29.041 --> 43:31.260
I'd understand, but fucking
Charlie, Charlie?

43:31.304 --> 43:34.568
Yo, call me ghostbusters, bitches,
but I ain't afraid of no ghost.

43:36.048 --> 43:36.831
Boo!

43:39.704 --> 43:41.619
I hate you fucking people.

43:41.662 --> 43:43.838
You know what? Fuck this.

43:43.882 --> 43:45.448
I'm done with this shit.

43:47.886 --> 43:50.410
You have no idea
what you have just done.

43:55.284 --> 43:57.069
Five motherfucking years?

43:57.112 --> 43:58.897
- I mean, damn!
- I know.

43:58.940 --> 44:01.160
My ass hurts just
thinking about it.

44:01.203 --> 44:02.814
Shut the fuck up, pussy cloud.

44:05.077 --> 44:06.774
Do you guys know
where Jamal's at?

44:08.733 --> 44:11.039
Bro, there ain't nothing
I could do about that.

44:11.083 --> 44:16.436
But what I can do is make this
weekend worth something.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.613
Oh!

44:20.440 --> 44:22.311
Take a whiff of that shit.

44:22.355 --> 44:23.791
Guys, where's Jamal?

44:24.749 --> 44:28.622
I don't know, they're probably
smoking weed or something.

44:31.233 --> 44:33.627
Ooh, that's hemp.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.804
Okay, I say roll
this shit up, dawg.

44:36.848 --> 44:38.850
I'm gonna go backwards,
bro, it's good.

44:39.938 --> 44:42.723
Do you guys really think
I look like Kim Kardashian?

44:44.290 --> 44:44.943
Yeah.

44:49.164 --> 44:50.818
I think Laurie's going to
give me some play, bro.

44:52.602 --> 44:55.693
- What do you think?
- Is she really a virgin?

44:56.606 --> 44:59.609
- I don't know, but hey, Sean, what you think?
- Couldn't do it, dawg.

44:59.653 --> 45:01.394
That bitch is insecure and shit.

45:03.526 --> 45:07.835
Yo, the insecure bitches like
Laurie, them the biggest freaks, though.

45:07.879 --> 45:09.097
Yo, take this.

45:23.416 --> 45:26.375
Yo, that shit is some kill
'cause I'm tweaking.

45:26.419 --> 45:28.247
Yo, pass that shit.

45:28.290 --> 45:29.378
I told you.

45:30.815 --> 45:31.990
Oh shit.

45:32.555 --> 45:33.774
What's good?

45:33.818 --> 45:36.821
Yo, fellas, I got some
business to tend to.

45:37.430 --> 45:42.087
So, um, I'm gonna see
you two ladies a little later.

45:43.044 --> 45:45.917
Anybody get no buns,
Captain Drydick.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.267
Bang, bang, bang.

45:50.791 --> 45:52.053
Yo, man, what I'm doing?

45:52.706 --> 45:56.666
Matter of fact, it's
about that time.

45:56.710 --> 45:57.711
Well.

46:02.760 --> 46:03.848
There you go, player.

46:03.891 --> 46:05.371
I'm about to go
upstairs with Kim.

46:05.414 --> 46:08.243
About to make it wobble
wobble and drop it like a sire.

46:08.287 --> 46:09.418
Do your thing.

46:12.857 --> 46:13.988
Lightweight.

46:16.861 --> 46:18.601
Just you and me, beautiful.

46:26.871 --> 46:28.350
Got your message, girl.

46:30.352 --> 46:31.745
Now, I was wondering when you're gonna
stop playing these games with me.

46:33.616 --> 46:35.009
What's with the
silent treatment?

46:38.360 --> 46:41.015
Oh, now that's what
I'm talking about.

46:44.671 --> 46:45.977
Oh yeah.

47:02.732 --> 47:06.040
Ow! What the fuck?

47:10.479 --> 47:12.046
Bitch, what the fuck?

47:18.313 --> 47:19.532
Oh!

47:25.755 --> 47:26.931
Wow.

47:28.106 --> 47:31.065
You really hit like a bitch.

47:36.114 --> 47:38.203
Open the fucking door.

47:39.204 --> 47:40.161
Fuck.

47:41.293 --> 47:43.512
Whoa, whoa,
why are you yelling?

47:43.556 --> 47:45.471
Dude, you're not gonna believe
what the fuck just happened to me.

47:45.514 --> 47:47.125
Yo, you're bleeding.

47:47.168 --> 47:49.040
- What happened?
- Laurie.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.172
That bitch fucking
tried to kill me.

47:51.216 --> 47:54.393
What the fuck are you talking about?
She's been with us for like the past hour.

47:55.046 --> 47:57.048
No, she texted me about
meeting her at the pool.

47:57.091 --> 47:59.050
Then that bitch went fucking
crazy and stabbed me.

47:59.093 --> 48:01.574
Okay, dude, you're fucking
high. Show me the text.

48:01.617 --> 48:02.314
Fuck.

48:05.447 --> 48:06.709
What the fuck?

48:06.753 --> 48:08.581
I swear I fucking had it.

48:10.148 --> 48:13.760
Brandon, when did you
get here? Oh, is that blood?

48:13.803 --> 48:16.328
Yo, bro, what the fuck
did you do to your arm?

48:16.371 --> 48:18.591
Does this fucking look like
I did this shit to myself?

48:19.026 --> 48:20.680
Something's not right here, man.

48:20.723 --> 48:21.986
I'm getting something
to clean that up.

48:22.029 --> 48:25.206
Bro, Laurie's been here
with us the entire time.

48:25.250 --> 48:27.905
That shit we smoked early
got you tweaking, B.

48:27.948 --> 48:30.081
Wait, are you saying that
I did this to you?

48:30.124 --> 48:31.604
Something is wrong here, bro.

48:31.647 --> 48:33.606
This is serious. Maybe we
get the fuck out of here.

48:33.649 --> 48:35.913
Dude, just relax.

48:36.391 --> 48:39.133
That's your problem,
you're too relaxed.

48:39.177 --> 48:41.266
Are you guys not fucking
listening to me?

48:41.919 --> 48:43.790
Something is not right here.

48:43.833 --> 48:45.357
We need to get
the fuck out of here.

48:46.532 --> 48:48.273
What the fuck?

48:48.316 --> 48:49.709
- What?
- Rachel.

48:51.058 --> 48:53.060
What? I'm hungry.

48:55.889 --> 48:58.022
You smell good.

48:58.065 --> 49:02.026
Okay, somebody get her away from me before
I have to drop-kick this bitch tonight.

49:02.069 --> 49:04.506
Damn, Jess. Why
are you so hostile?

49:04.550 --> 49:07.814
Okay, you're the last person
that can even say shit to me.

49:09.816 --> 49:11.426
Hey, wait, where are you going?

49:13.385 --> 49:16.257
Didn't I tell your ass to step off?
Why don't you go talk to JLo? Fuck you.

49:17.867 --> 49:19.521
You are such an ass, Jamal.

49:20.348 --> 49:21.610
Damn, bro.

49:21.654 --> 49:23.873
Fuck this shit, man.
This is my last weekend.

49:23.917 --> 49:27.094
I'll be damned if I'm living
myself to just one piece of ass.

49:27.138 --> 49:29.662
- You smell me?
- No.

49:29.705 --> 49:31.881
Hating is bad for
your health, shorty.

49:31.925 --> 49:33.013
Whatever.

49:33.057 --> 49:34.928
Yeah, I'm out of
here, man. Whatever.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.712
This is one fucked-up weekend.

49:36.756 --> 49:38.714
I'm gonna go smoke some more.

50:11.356 --> 50:13.706
Go away, Jamal.

50:14.402 --> 50:15.838
It's me, Rachel.

50:15.882 --> 50:17.014
Can I come in?

50:18.406 --> 50:20.887
I was just wanted to come
in and check in on you.

50:20.930 --> 50:23.411
No. I'm fine, I'm just...

50:24.195 --> 50:25.631
I hate when he
fucking does that.

50:25.674 --> 50:28.112
It makes me so crazy.
Like... look at me.

50:29.504 --> 50:32.899
You know I'm smart, got
a great sense of humor,

50:32.942 --> 50:38.252
I'm loyal and I got a tight ass body,
like, who wouldn't want this? Flawless.

50:38.992 --> 50:40.689
Yes, you are.

50:41.212 --> 50:41.995
You know,

50:43.910 --> 50:47.044
the only thing Jamal cares about is
trying to fuck burrito belly and,

50:47.087 --> 50:49.176
well, whoever else he
can stick his dick into.

50:49.916 --> 50:50.917
It's okay.

50:51.744 --> 50:53.963
Don't give Jamal
another thought.

51:00.492 --> 51:03.016
Just breathe.

51:22.035 --> 51:23.863
Whoa, whoa.

51:23.906 --> 51:26.648
Rachel, what are you doing?
What are you, like, gay or something?

51:27.301 --> 51:29.477
No, silly, I'm not gay.

51:31.305 --> 51:33.133
I'm just hungry.

51:34.961 --> 51:36.441
Goddamn it, Rachel.

51:49.628 --> 51:53.458
- What the fuck girl?
- She attacked me. Look at my fucking leg.

51:53.501 --> 51:55.155
Bitch tried to chew it off.

51:55.199 --> 51:58.289
See? I told y'all some crazy
shit going on here.

51:58.332 --> 51:59.855
Now I'm out of here.

51:59.899 --> 52:01.857
- Yeah, I'm going. Let's go.
- Okay.

52:06.601 --> 52:10.953
Help
me. Please help me.

52:25.054 --> 52:27.187
- Why are you just standing there?
- You can't leave.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.884
You have to finish the game.

52:28.928 --> 52:31.974
Does it look like we want to
play a fucking game right now?

52:32.018 --> 52:33.150
I'm out.

52:36.457 --> 52:39.634
- Come on bro, let's speed out of here, man.
- But I can't open it.

52:39.678 --> 52:41.288
You have to finish the game.

52:41.332 --> 52:43.856
Look, bitch, whatever voodoo-type
shit you're trying to pull,

52:43.899 --> 52:46.075
you better knock
the fuck right now.

52:46.119 --> 52:49.296
- Jess, stop!
- You have to finish the game.

53:20.719 --> 53:22.068
Hello?

53:22.111 --> 53:25.114
<i>♪ Charlie, Charlie, Charlie ♪</i>

53:25.637 --> 53:29.206
<i>♪ Will you play with Charlie? ♪</i>

53:29.771 --> 53:36.996
<i>♪ Ashes, ashes
They all fall down ♪</i>

53:43.263 --> 53:45.047
How's that possible?

53:45.091 --> 53:47.354
Go check the fucking
windows, all of them.

53:48.312 --> 53:50.662
It's not me, it's Charlie.

53:50.705 --> 53:53.404
Okay, enough of this fucking
Charlie bullshit, okay?

53:53.447 --> 53:56.450
Whatever the fuck you put in Rachel's
drink that made her lose her mind

53:56.494 --> 53:58.452
and go all Hannibal
Lecter on us, yeah,

53:58.496 --> 54:01.063
you can bet the police are gonna
fucking hear about this.

54:01.107 --> 54:06.895
So I suggest you go upstairs and pack your
fucking bags and head for the fucking border.

54:06.939 --> 54:08.332
Comprende?

54:08.375 --> 54:10.725
Repent your sins
or die from them.

54:13.380 --> 54:16.078
Can you believe that?
That bitch still won't leave.

54:16.122 --> 54:19.908
- Why don't you just call the fucking police?
- That's a good idea.

54:20.822 --> 54:22.650
Hey, do you guys have reception?

54:23.434 --> 54:25.131
No, I got no signal.

54:25.914 --> 54:28.265
No, I know I had
a signal earlier.

54:30.963 --> 54:34.140
You know, I'm getting really
sick of this shit, honestly.

54:35.924 --> 54:38.187
I think I left my phone upstairs,
I will be right back, okay?

54:55.509 --> 54:57.206
Fucking disgusting.

54:58.904 --> 55:00.601
Let's call a housekeeper.

55:08.696 --> 55:09.871
What the fuck?

55:25.191 --> 55:26.584
What the fuck?

55:45.516 --> 55:46.821
What the fuck?

55:48.954 --> 55:52.479
Do you enjoy
being this pathetic?

55:53.132 --> 55:54.263
No.

55:54.307 --> 55:56.353
Then why don't you
do something about it?

55:56.962 --> 56:01.445
Let's face it, Laurie, you will
never be as pretty as Kim.

56:01.488 --> 56:03.969
You'll never be
as badass as me.

56:04.752 --> 56:07.364
You're not shapely.

56:07.407 --> 56:09.104
You're not funny.

56:09.714 --> 56:12.151
You're not strong.

56:12.194 --> 56:14.283
You have no talent.

56:14.327 --> 56:16.590
You're barely just getting by.

56:16.634 --> 56:19.376
Do you really want
to live like this?

56:21.073 --> 56:21.813
No.

56:22.291 --> 56:23.336
No?

56:26.383 --> 56:29.864
Down, not across.

56:34.303 --> 56:35.783
Charlie's here.

56:35.827 --> 56:38.046
Okay, bitch, we don't need
to hear that right now.

56:38.090 --> 56:41.267
Yo, B, why don't you go upstairs
and see if Laurie found her phone?

56:41.310 --> 56:43.617
Hell no.

56:43.661 --> 56:46.011
- What the fuck you mean no?
- What, you still think Laurie was the one who attacked you?

56:46.054 --> 56:48.230
Oh wait, let me guess,
it was Charlie.

56:48.274 --> 56:50.363
There's no time
for jokes now, Kim.

56:50.407 --> 56:51.756
Shit ain't right.

56:51.799 --> 56:54.323
Man, can you go see if she
found her phone, please?

56:54.367 --> 56:55.629
Go.

56:55.673 --> 56:58.023
All right, man. Geez!

57:18.522 --> 57:20.785
- You can do it.
- I can't.

57:20.828 --> 57:22.787
- I can't.
- Fuck it. I'll do it.

57:25.746 --> 57:27.269
Laurie, it's Brandon.

57:29.271 --> 57:30.142
Are you in there?

57:32.449 --> 57:33.493
Yeah.

57:33.928 --> 57:36.453
- Well, they sent me...
- Sent you what?

57:37.192 --> 57:41.240
They sent me up here to see if you had
found your phone and if you had signal.

57:43.198 --> 57:46.550
Yeah, got my phone.

57:47.028 --> 57:49.727
I haven't checked for a signal yet.
Do you wanna check?

57:52.556 --> 57:54.296
Brandon, is something wrong?

57:55.297 --> 57:59.084
Wrong? Not exactly wrong per se.

58:09.703 --> 58:11.792
You know I always
wanted you, right?

58:15.579 --> 58:17.537
Why didn't you ever make
that move then, huh?

58:17.581 --> 58:19.626
You're always with
your cheering squad.

58:20.409 --> 58:23.978
Could never get my turn.

58:32.465 --> 58:34.032
What the hell is going on here?

58:34.511 --> 58:35.642
It's Charlie.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.166
There's definitely
something wrong here.

58:38.602 --> 58:39.994
I agree.

58:40.038 --> 58:42.475
Rachel, who we've all known
since elementary school

58:42.519 --> 58:44.346
just tried chewing off
my fucking leg.

58:44.869 --> 58:48.089
I knew something was wrong the minute
she started drinking and eating chips.

58:48.133 --> 58:51.353
We all know Rachel
never eats chips.

58:51.397 --> 58:53.530
And Brandon claimed
that Laurie tried to kill him.

58:53.573 --> 58:55.836
None of this shit's
making any sense.

58:55.880 --> 58:59.448
Charlie's putting all of you
against the other through the game.

59:00.058 --> 59:01.320
Can't trust nobody.

59:03.148 --> 59:04.671
And we are all locked in this
motherfucker like animals in a cage.

59:04.715 --> 59:06.325
You have to finish the game.

59:06.368 --> 59:10.155
Enough with the game bullshit,
people are dying here.

59:10.198 --> 59:12.287
You have to repent your sins.

59:12.331 --> 59:15.421
Repent? Repent?
All this crazy shit

59:15.464 --> 59:18.467
started happening the minute your
ass walked into my goddamn house.

59:18.511 --> 59:19.556
That's true.

59:20.469 --> 59:22.167
Stay the fuck away
from me, Sara.

59:22.210 --> 59:23.864
I need a smoke.

59:23.908 --> 59:26.693
You guys, what's keeping
Brandon and Laurie?

59:27.476 --> 59:28.956
Let me go check on them.

59:45.407 --> 59:46.408
Brandon.

59:46.452 --> 59:48.062
- What?
- Stop.

59:48.106 --> 59:51.022
- Stop what?
- Stop trying to have sex with me, I'm not ready.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.894
I feel like you're ready to me.

59:53.938 --> 59:56.027
- Brandon, I'm serious.
- Me too.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.900
Come on, it's not like
we're gonna do anything.

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:01.598
Okay.

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:09.867
Jamal.

01:00:16.308 --> 01:00:17.265
Wait a minute.

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:19.311
Didn't you die?

01:00:19.354 --> 01:00:20.965
It's the house, Jamal.

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:26.361
Nothing is as it seems.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:28.886
None of this is real.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.411
Come with me.

01:00:32.454 --> 01:00:35.501
Bitch, where? What about
this Charlie, Charlie shit?

01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:39.244
Just a silly game.

01:00:40.114 --> 01:00:41.594
So what do you
want to do with me?

01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:45.424
Come with me.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:56.827
- What are you doing?
- Quit being a fucking tease.

01:00:58.437 --> 01:01:01.570
Stop it! Brandon!
You're hurting me!

01:01:09.578 --> 01:01:10.971
Take off your clothes.

01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:13.147
I thought I wouldn't get some.

01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:40.479
What the fuck, yo?

01:01:40.522 --> 01:01:42.002
No, fuck. Let me out!

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.401
Help!

01:01:50.968 --> 01:01:53.013
Please let me out!

01:01:55.929 --> 01:02:00.368
Ugh! What is that
god-awful smell?

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:02.849
Smells like burnt flesh.

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.504
Oh my god, Laurie.

01:02:06.548 --> 01:02:07.332
What happened?

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:11.815
You're all so fucking fake.

01:02:14.382 --> 01:02:19.039
The designer clothes,
expensive purses.

01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:23.783
You don't care about me.

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.089
We do care.

01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:27.439
Jasmine.

01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:33.401
You told me that
I was weak and that

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:35.839
I was pathetic

01:02:36.578 --> 01:02:40.408
and then you gave me a knife
to cut my own fucking wrist.

01:02:43.194 --> 01:02:45.587
None of that
ever happened, Laurie.

01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:46.763
I love you.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.679
Laurie, we all love you.
You know that. You know we care.

01:02:50.723 --> 01:02:52.116
Bullshit!

01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:56.816
BBOC is all you care about,
bad bitches of Cally.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.733
And the only reason that you
included me in your group right?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:05.259
Was so that I could do your
work, and you could cheat off me.

01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:09.829
Because you're both
so fucking brain dead.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:13.528
Okay, none of what you're
saying is making any sense.

01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:15.400
And Brandon.

01:03:18.969 --> 01:03:20.797
He raped me!

01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:25.323
You knew I was a virgin, right?

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.763
He took that from me.

01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:34.854
I feel stupid.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.945
So fucking stupid.

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:45.169
Okay, Laurie, just....

01:03:46.953 --> 01:03:49.913
Laurie. Laurie. Laurie, no! No!

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:52.698
- Oh my god!
- Jas, cover it!

01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:58.225
Oh my God.

01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:59.531
Tell me I'm pretty.

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:01.359
You are. You're beautiful.

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:05.015
Yeah, you are.

01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:07.582
Oh my God.

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:10.934
Laurie. Laurie.

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:15.590
Oh! Oh my God.

01:04:30.823 --> 01:04:31.998
Oh my God.

01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:34.522
Is she dead?

01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:37.395
You have to finish the game.

01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.878
We're getting taken
over by our sins.

01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:45.838
- If we don't finish this, we'll never be able to...
- Repent.

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:48.188
Fuck your stupid game!

01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:49.886
I'm going to look for Jamal.

01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:05.292
Jamal's dead.

01:05:05.336 --> 01:05:05.902
What?

01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:08.034
How?

01:05:08.078 --> 01:05:10.384
He burnt up in the sauna.

01:05:12.517 --> 01:05:14.998
Where'd that fucking
gun come from?

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:16.782
My mom keeps it
under her pillow.

01:05:18.697 --> 01:05:21.830
Thought you said the room upstairs
with the sauna had no electricity.

01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:23.702
It doesn't.

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:27.880
Okay, well if anyone of you comes near
me, I will fucking kill you.

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.274
We have to move now.

01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:32.058
You're all running out of time.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:37.585
We have to finish the game.

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:50.337
So how are you doing it, huh?

01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:51.991
Invisible strings?

01:05:52.818 --> 01:05:53.950
Magnets?

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:57.170
Tell me.

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:58.998
I don't think it's a trick.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:01.566
No, that's what she
wants you to think.

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:05.004
She wants you to buy in all
this Charlie Charlie bullshit.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:08.399
You need to wake up to the reality
of what's happening right now.

01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:10.488
More of us will
die if you don't.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.405
What were the rules again?

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.885
Yes or no questions.

01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:18.800
Don't ever drop the pencils.

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.629
You need permission to leave.

01:06:21.673 --> 01:06:24.328
Well we already broke one.
You can thank Laurie for that.

01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:26.895
Yeah, except she's dead.

01:06:27.331 --> 01:06:29.028
So we can't.

01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.812
We have to play the game.

01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:33.250
Okay? We have to play the game.

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:34.207
Whoa.

01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:35.817
Did you just see that?

01:06:36.644 --> 01:06:37.732
What?

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:39.343
Something just ran by.

01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:42.476
We're running out of time.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.218
Look, I'm not playing
this shit again.

01:06:45.262 --> 01:06:47.960
That's what caused this
crazy shit in the first place.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.528
Enough of this bullshit.
We're doing this.

01:06:52.486 --> 01:06:54.010
I'd rather die.

01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:55.663
That's on you then.

01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:09.155
I'm in.

01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:10.156
Me, too.

01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:18.164
Death is struck, and nature
quaking, all creation is awaking,

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:21.602
whatever hides will appear.

01:07:21.646 --> 01:07:23.691
Good becomes evil.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:25.606
Fuck this shit!

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.652
Faith becomes fear.

01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:30.046
God, I'm done with
this stupid ass game!

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:36.443
We have to finish the game.

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:41.100
That bitch is fucking crazy.

01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:43.233
I saw something.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.064
Sean?

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:52.981
I'm not fucking crazy.

01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:02.078
Okay, Sean, this
is so not funny.

01:08:27.581 --> 01:08:28.712
Oh my God!

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:37.374
Time to pop a cap.

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:41.203
Let's go purge on this bitch.

01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:44.337
Jas, the bitch dies
tonight, got it?

01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:46.470
You have
to finish the game.

01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:47.948
Bitch!

01:08:54.694 --> 01:08:55.609
Did you hear that?

01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:25.421
- What is that?
- I don't know.

01:09:30.078 --> 01:09:31.515
I'll check it out.

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:44.745
It's just your supply closet.

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:45.964
Jas!

01:10:29.964 --> 01:10:31.531
You still don't get it.

01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:34.230
You don't understand.

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:39.713
No, bitch, you don't understand.

01:10:39.757 --> 01:10:42.281
You should
have listened to her.

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:43.891
Well played.

01:10:44.544 --> 01:10:46.067
Who the fuck are you?

01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:47.634
Charlie, Charlie, bitch.

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:49.767
Alive and well.

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:52.378
Actually dead and well.

01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:53.814
You get the point.

01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:56.513
Poor Sara.

01:10:57.775 --> 01:10:59.777
The only one to ever
escape the game alive.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:02.301
She was actually
here to help you.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:06.784
But you guys didn't listen and now
she's dead because of you guys' sins.

01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:09.221
Life's a bitch, isn't it?

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.309
No.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:12.006
She was trying to kill us.

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:15.793
No, she was trying to warn you.

01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:17.795
Oh God, where did you go?

01:11:17.838 --> 01:11:20.276
Come find me.

01:11:24.976 --> 01:11:26.804
Kim? Is that you?

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:30.503
No.

01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:34.551
But it's time for you to get
reunited with some old friends.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:43.951
What's wrong, Jas?

01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:49.696
Not happy to see me?

01:11:51.089 --> 01:11:52.656
None of you are real.

01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:53.831
None of this is real.

01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:56.094
We are real, Jasmine.

01:11:56.137 --> 01:11:57.748
As real as it gets.

01:11:58.357 --> 01:11:59.924
And I'm still hungry.

01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.056
Get away from me.

01:12:02.927 --> 01:12:05.495
No! No! Help me!

01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:09.847
One more to go.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:31.608
Fuck.

01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:23.442
Oh...

01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:26.837
Where's she? What did
you do with Jasmine?

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.361
Oh, she stopped

01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:33.147
to catch up with some
old friends.

01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:36.673
You sick twisted freak.

01:13:37.238 --> 01:13:38.239
Kim,

01:13:39.502 --> 01:13:41.591
do you ever wonder why
your dad abandoned you?

01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:48.424
You don't know shit about my father
and I know he'd never abandoned me.

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:51.035
He's not in an institution.

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:53.124
He died five years ago.

01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:56.388
Remember the last night you
ever spoke to him?

01:13:56.823 --> 01:13:58.738
They say he died,
he'd escaped at night.

01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:03.351
But we both know better, huh.

01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:08.269
Go to hell, Charlie.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.403
Home sweet home.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.752
Let's play the game.

01:14:38.343 --> 01:14:40.258
Tic, toc...

01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:44.305
Kim.

01:14:46.264 --> 01:14:50.181
Oh, your poor daddy.

01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:55.273
Had so much fun killing him.

01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:58.406
Kim.

01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:02.759
What about the
love of your life?

01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:04.935
What about Jamal?

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:09.853
He burned so good.

01:15:11.332 --> 01:15:14.510
Oh, oh, and Laurie.

01:15:16.599 --> 01:15:18.296
The coward didn't
wait for me to kill her.

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:23.214
To cut her throat open, huh?

01:15:24.302 --> 01:15:25.521
You're closer, Kim.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.088
Oh, Jasmine.

01:15:29.742 --> 01:15:31.701
She tasted so good.

01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:40.884
You can stop evil
where the lines cross.

01:15:40.927 --> 01:15:42.538
Where the lines cross!

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:45.671
You can only stop evil
where the lines cross!

01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:48.805
You can only defeat evil
where the lines cross!

01:15:48.848 --> 01:15:50.546
Where the lines cross!

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:52.156
Where the lines cross!

01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:53.766
You can only defeat evil
where the lines cross!

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:56.247
Where the lines cross,
what does that even mean?

01:15:58.336 --> 01:15:59.685
Over here, Kim.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.123
Let's play the game.

01:16:04.908 --> 01:16:06.474
Kim.

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:10.435
We're all waiting for you.

01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:16.484
Are you excited?

01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:22.316
Come play with me.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.972
I feel alone.

01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:29.802
Let's play together.

01:16:32.065 --> 01:16:34.633
I'm sorry, you're going to have
to end up like everybody else.

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:37.549
Come here, Kim.

01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:40.073
I'm waiting.

01:16:43.076 --> 01:16:44.817
Let's be alone.

01:17:02.835 --> 01:17:03.967
Wait.

01:17:08.362 --> 01:17:09.755
Oh, my God.

01:17:12.497 --> 01:17:15.065
We played with two pencils.

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.984
Dad.

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:26.380
Daddy, I remember the
words you taught me.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:33.518
First John 4:4.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:42.919
"Ye are of God, little children,
and have overcome them:

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:49.969
because greater is he that is in
you than he that is in the world."

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.848
<i>One more, dad.</i>

01:18:00.414 --> 01:18:02.373
<i>What am I? What am I?</i>

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:16.735
Through the blood of Jesus Christ I am
redeemed out of the hand of the devil

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:18.737
and all my sins are forgiven.

01:18:24.569 --> 01:18:29.139
The blood of Jesus Christ is
cleansing me from all of my sins.

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:37.669
Father in Heaven,

01:18:40.367 --> 01:18:43.762
in the name of Jesus I believe
that Jesus died on the cross

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:46.678
for my sins and rose
again from the dead.

01:18:48.158 --> 01:18:51.378
I confess all my
sins and repent.

01:18:51.422 --> 01:18:53.946
I forgive everyone
who has ever hurt me.

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.733
I transfer all pain,
abandonment, betrayal

01:18:59.038 --> 01:19:00.170
and abuse

01:19:00.997 --> 01:19:03.347
to the cross of Jesus Christ.

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:06.480
Father, please forgive
me for my sins.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:09.701
Found you.

01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:12.138
Game over, bitch.

01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:15.315
I am justified and made righteous
just as if I had never sinned.

01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:17.535
I'm set apart for God.

01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:19.363
God doesn't play this game.

01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:20.756
He's too busy.

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:22.758
I believe he's gonna
meet me in heaven.

01:19:23.846 --> 01:19:25.195
A pathetic game.

01:19:26.674 --> 01:19:28.459
Let's have some
real fun.

01:19:29.242 --> 01:19:30.374
Ugh!

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:37.642
My body is a temple for the Holy Spirit, redeemed
and cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ,

01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:42.560
body, soul and spirit.

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.780
I belong to Jesus now.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.450
You can only defeat evil
where the lines cross.

01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:46.450
No, no, no. No.

01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.514
Are you okay?

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.521
Young, I'm telling you
it's not gonna open.

01:21:59.479 --> 01:22:01.873
We tried that earlier.
That did not work.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.744
Look, you're... you're safe now.

01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:05.572
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:10.403
No, it's not. Laurie is dead,
Jamal is dead. They are all dead.

01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:13.058
Okay.

01:22:13.102 --> 01:22:16.279
Don't go back in.
Please, don't go back.

01:22:16.322 --> 01:22:19.804
I'm gonna go back and check
to see if anybody's still alive.

01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:24.461
- Hey, hey...
- No, Young, we can just leave right now.

01:22:25.027 --> 01:22:26.593
I've got this under control.

01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:29.335
Young's got this.

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:16.034
Know what? Fuck this,
I'm done with this shit.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:18.906
You have no idea
what you have just done.

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:20.560
Kill that one for me.

01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:23.302
Help!

01:23:25.174 --> 01:23:26.305
Please let me out!

01:23:31.876 --> 01:23:32.442
Shit!

01:23:33.486 --> 01:23:34.879
Should have listened
to her, bro.

01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:37.012
You see my point?

01:23:55.827 --> 01:23:58.053
