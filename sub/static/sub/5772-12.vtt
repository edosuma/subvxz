LEAVING NEW YORK CITY

00:03.304 --> 00:05.073
FOR A FELLOWSHIP
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:05.106 --> 00:07.508
AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY
IS BOTH SCARY AND EXCITING.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.742
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL

00:08.776 --> 00:10.578
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST DAY
OF COLLEGE AGAIN.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.413
WILL IT BE LIKE FELICITY?
WHO'LL BE MY BEN?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.814
WHO'LL BE MY NOEL?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.383
WHO WILL BE
MY GREG GRUNBERG?

00:15.416 --> 00:17.285
ME, YOU DOPE.
I'M ALL THE GUYS.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.552
YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING
A FELLOWSHIP

00:18.586 --> 00:20.121
IN REPRODUCTIVE
ENDOCRINOLOGY

00:20.154 --> 00:22.190
AND NOT PLEDGING
A SORORITY, RIGHT?

00:22.223 --> 00:23.657
OBVIOUSLY, DANNY!
BUT...

00:23.691 --> 00:25.726
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
JOIN AN A CAPPELLA GROUP?

00:25.759 --> 00:28.062
OH! OR BETTER YET,
AN IMPROV TROUPE,

00:28.096 --> 00:29.663
'CAUSE I'M SO QUICK
ON MY...

00:29.697 --> 00:30.764

00:30.798 --> 00:32.766
ANYWAY, SUPER-GOOD
AT IMPROV,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.136
VOICE OF A NIGHTINGALE.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.373
HEL-LO, STANFORD!

00:39.407 --> 00:41.309

00:49.717 --> 00:52.520
I ACTUALLY DON'T SPEAK
ANY INDIAN LANGUAGES,

00:52.553 --> 00:55.323
BUT I DO KNOW HOW TO DO A KIND
OF OFFENSIVE INDIAN ACCENT.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.590
OH...

00:56.624 --> 00:59.293
I'M NEEPA, FROM GWALIOR.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

00:59.327 --> 01:01.195
BOSTON, BABY.
HOME OF THE FREEDOM TRAIL

01:01.229 --> 01:02.563

01:05.133 --> 01:06.200
[snapping]
HEY.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.601
THIS IS NEIL, MY SON.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.238
I'M SORRY--I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A CHILD IN THIS ROOM.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.374
MY HUSBAND IS BACK IN INDIA
WORKING IN A CHEMICAL PLANT

01:13.407 --> 01:17.478
UNTIL I FINISH THIS FELLOWSHIP
AND WE CAN BE A FAMILY AGAIN.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.779
THIS HANDSOME ONE
RIGHT HERE...

01:18.812 --> 01:20.181
HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE
EITHER.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.283
NEW YORK CITY.
BUT HE'S GONNA VISIT A LOT,

01:22.316 --> 01:23.784
BECAUSE HE'S GOT
A TON OF MILES

01:23.817 --> 01:25.786
'CAUSE HE'S CONSTANTLY
COMPLAINING TO THE AIRLINES.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.788
YEAH, I DON'T LIKE WHEN
THEY CHANGE THE GATE ON ME.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.290
I'M ALL SET UP AT 42B,

01:29.323 --> 01:31.259
AND THEN THEY REROUTE ME
TO 41.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.760
I MEAN...IT'LL COST YOU.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.229
WE'RE IN
THE SAME BOAT.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.597
THANKS.

(Danny)
I WROTE DOWN YOUR

01:42.670 --> 01:44.272

01:44.305 --> 01:45.806

THIS IS A MONEY BELT

01:45.839 --> 01:48.342
SO YOU DON'T GET ROBBED.
[chuckles]
DANNY...

01:48.376 --> 01:51.279
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE MY DAD
DROPPING ME OFF AT COLLEGE.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.813
WHAT'S NEXT--YOU GONNA
GIVE ME BROWN BEAR

01:52.846 --> 01:54.615
EVEN THOUGH I'VE TOTALLY
OUTGROWN HIM?

01:55.816 --> 01:58.286
[gasps]
BROWN BEAR!

01:58.319 --> 02:00.221
I GUESS HE CAN
STAY HERE WITH ME

02:00.254 --> 02:02.423
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T NEED HIM.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.425
HE TAKES UP NO ROOM.
NO. HE'S SMALL.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.596
WHAT'S THIS STUFF?
OH, MY SUPERVISOR'S
HOSTING

02:08.629 --> 02:11.232

WITH THAT GUY.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.906
I TELL YOU WHAT--
WHY DON'T I GIVE HIM A CALL

02:18.939 --> 02:20.908
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR YOU?

02:20.941 --> 02:22.910
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THAT, DANNY.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.478
WHY NOT?
YOU LOVE NEPOTISM.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.214
THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER

02:26.247 --> 02:28.316
IF THE NEXT PRESIDENT
WAS JUST THIS PRESIDENT'S KID?

02:28.349 --> 02:30.351
I DON'T WANT YOU TO CALL IN
ANY FAVORS FOR ME.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.220
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT ME,

02:32.253 --> 02:33.454
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME--

02:33.487 --> 02:34.488
OH, MY GOD!

02:34.522 --> 02:36.757
IS THIS $1,000
IN TRAVELER'S CHEQUES?

02:36.790 --> 02:38.226
HOT DIGGITY!

02:38.259 --> 02:40.961
OKAY. NOW...

02:40.994 --> 02:42.730
I WANNA DO THIS ON MY OWN.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.232
YEAH?
MM-HMM.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.866

HEY...ROSIE'S REALLY

02:50.571 --> 02:51.872

[beeping, buzzing]

03:07.421 --> 03:08.889
[beep]

03:08.922 --> 03:10.324
OH, GOOD MORNING, SLEEPY HEAD!

03:10.358 --> 03:12.360
I'M IN CALIFORNIA.
IT'S 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.394
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SO AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,

03:13.427 --> 03:16.464
THE HOSPITAL BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT IS IN TWO DAYS,

03:16.497 --> 03:18.999
AND OUR TEAM...

03:19.032 --> 03:20.968
MORGAN'S BEST FRIENDS--

03:21.001 --> 03:22.903
(Tamra)
YOU SEE THAT?
WE HAVE A PRACTICE
TONIGHT,

03:22.936 --> 03:24.405
AND WE WERE THINKING
MAYBE YOU SHOULD

03:24.438 --> 03:25.439
TAKE AN EARLIER FLIGHT IN
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.675
I FOUND A FLIGHT WITH
A CONNECTION IN ALASKA.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.311
IT'S $4,500, BUT IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.246
I'M NOT DOING THAT, BUT...

03:32.280 --> 03:34.815
I'LL BE HOME FOR THE GAME
SO, UH...

03:34.848 --> 03:36.684
I GOTTA GET BACK TO BED.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.386
GOOD NIGHT.
BYE!

03:38.419 --> 03:40.321
WHOO!

03:40.354 --> 03:41.722
MORGAN, YOU'RE A REALLY
GOOD COACH.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.757
THANKS, TAM.
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING, YOU KNOW.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.293
YOU OWN 40 DOGS
AND YOU THINK

03:45.326 --> 03:47.461
ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE LIKE
AIR BUD, BUT NO...

03:47.495 --> 03:49.463
[giggling]

03:49.497 --> 03:51.932
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YA
AT PRACTICE, CHAMP.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.472
(Mindy)
VOILA. MY FIRST STANFORD PARTY.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.677
(man)
DUE TO THE NATURE
OF THE PROCEDURE,

04:03.711 --> 04:05.379
YOU WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU ARE ALL CURRENT

04:05.413 --> 04:07.848
WITH YOUR BASIC--
CAN I HELP YOU?

04:08.916 --> 04:13.421
OH, NO.
I'M SO SORRY. I--

04:13.454 --> 04:15.423
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A KICK-OFF PARTY?

04:15.456 --> 04:18.992
IT SAID KICK-OFF BASH: BEGINNING
OF ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIP HANGOUT.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.696
WELL, AT LEAST I GOT HERE
BEFORE THE PROFESSOR ARRIVED.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.931
THAT WOULD BE ME.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.633
THE GUY DOWN HERE
AT THE FRONT.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.835
YOU'RE DR. GURGLER?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.404
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
I--I'VE APOLOGIZED.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.573
I WILL SAY, THIS IS
A LITTLE MISLEADING.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.375
ALL OF US EASILY
UNDERSTOOD THE ACRONYM.

04:34.408 --> 04:37.811
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
MEDICALLY BLONDE HERE THINKS...

04:37.845 --> 04:38.979
[laughter]

04:39.012 --> 04:40.548
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE MEAN,

04:40.581 --> 04:41.715
BUT THANK YOU FOR
CALLING ME BLONDE.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.083
THIS IS A VERY
RIGOROUS PROGRAM

04:43.116 --> 04:45.085
THAT WILL REQUIRE
A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY.
NEEPA!

04:45.118 --> 04:46.086
IT'S YOUR FRIEND, MINDY!

04:46.119 --> 04:48.422
NEEPA. NEEPA!

04:48.456 --> 04:49.823
WE WILL--
WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.659
AND SIT DOWN!

04:51.692 --> 04:53.427
I ACTUALLY CAN'T SIT
IN THIS DRESS.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.028
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE I'M NOT
WEARING UNDERWEAR.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.630
[low murmurs]

04:58.098 --> 05:00.668
female GPS voice:
3 MILES TO AIRPORT.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.069
(Danny)
REALLY NICE NAV SYSTEM
YOU GOT HERE.

05:02.102 --> 05:06.106
I MEAN, I'D BE MORE CONFIDENT
IF IT WAS A GUY'S VOICE...

05:06.139 --> 05:08.976
BUT THAT'S JUST ME.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.512
HEY, WOULD YOU STOP
BEING SO NERVOUS?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.113
YEAH, I'M NOT.
IT'S JUST THAT THIS FELLOWSHIP

05:13.146 --> 05:15.616
IS A LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.
EVERYBODY HATES ME.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.418
IT'S LIKE THE TIME
I WENT TO FAT CAMP

05:17.451 --> 05:20.087
WHEN I WAS A KID--I WAS BY FAR
THE SKINNIEST ONE.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.922
YEAH, LOOK,
I KNOW IT'S HARD,

05:21.955 --> 05:23.357
BUT IF YOU WANT ME
TO CALL ROB,

05:23.391 --> 05:24.625
I CAN DO THAT,
NO PROBLEM.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.759
NO, NO, DON'T DO THAT.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.428
I NEED TO DO THIS
ON MY OWN.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.696
MAYBE I SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.063
I'M ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD
AT APOLOGIES.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.131
I MEAN, YOU FORGAVE ME

05:31.164 --> 05:34.435
FOR DYING ALL YOUR GRAY HAIRS
BLACK IN YOUR SLEEP.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.603
WHAT?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.838
YEAH. DO YOU THINK YOU WERE
MAGICALLY GETTING YOUNGER?

05:39.407 --> 05:41.108
I'M SORRY, BARBARA, THAT WE
NEVER GO OUT ANYMORE,

05:41.141 --> 05:44.478
BUT...LOOK, THIS IS THE JOB
THAT PAYS FOR YOUR SCARVES.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.079
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU NEED TO--

05:46.113 --> 05:48.482
I'VE GOTTA GO.
[beep]

05:48.516 --> 05:50.117
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.852
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.521
OKAY.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.788
IS THAT ALL?

05:54.822 --> 05:57.591
BA-DEE-BA-DEE-BA-DEE--
THAT'S ALL, FOLKS!

05:57.625 --> 05:58.959
(Mindy)
SO...

05:58.992 --> 06:00.794
IDIOT!
YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT?

06:00.828 --> 06:03.397
WHO WOULD PARK A BIKE
IN A PARKING SPOT?

06:03.431 --> 06:05.165
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.134
THAT IS MY CAR.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.003
THAT'S A BIKE.
UH, NO...
IT'S A CAR.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.805
IT'S TECHNICALLY
A MOTOR VEHICLE,

06:11.839 --> 06:13.674
AND IT COST $20,000.
THERE'S NO MOTOR.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.842
MY FEET WOULD BE
THE MOTOR?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.009
LIKE FRED FLINTSTONE?

06:16.043 --> 06:19.146
YEAH. IN HIS PREHISTORIC
CAR.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.149
FACED! WELCOME TO
PALO ALTO, GENIUS.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.886
HEY, DR. GURGLER!
YOU WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

06:25.919 --> 06:28.088
WITH DANNY CASTELLANO,
RIGHT?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.825
YEAH.
WELL, HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.060
YEAH. WHEN I KNEW HIM,

06:33.093 --> 06:34.462
DAN ALWAYS DID LIKE
HISPANIC GIRLS.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.063
WELL, I'M--IT--
OKAY, YEAH.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.798
OKAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.800
BUT HE'S STILL IN TOWN.
MAYBE YOU WANT TO HANG OUT.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.435
I'D LOVE TO SEE
DAN THE MAN AGAIN.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.803
[both chuckle]

06:42.836 --> 06:44.204
ARE YOU GONNA BE THERE?
YEAH, I'M GONNA BE THERE.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.639
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.007
COULD YOU GUYS DO
A DOUBLE DATE TONIGHT?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.609
YES.
I'LL CLEAR MY SCHEDULE.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.445
OKAY, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.215
HEY, BABE.

TURNS OUT,
I DO NEED YOUR HELP.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.026
HEY, NEEPS.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.161
I AM ACTUALLY LEAVING WORK
EARLY TODAY.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.196
DR. GURGLER KNOWS.
MM.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.064
I'M ACTUALLY HAVING
DINNER WITH HIM,

07:11.098 --> 07:14.034
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD COVER ME.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.537
I COULD BRING YOU AND NEIL
DINNER BACK FROM THE RESTAURANT.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.206
I WOULD NOT ACCEPT
YOUR GUILT DINNER.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.809
YOUR LOSS--IT WAS GONNA BE
SLOPPY JOES.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.978
[cell phone rings]

07:25.012 --> 07:26.914
TALK TO ME, PLAYER.
HEY, BUDDY.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.981
I GOTTA STAY AN EXTRA DAY.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.150

07:30.183 --> 07:32.753
WHAT? NO! NO, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT--ANSWER ME RIGHT NOW.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.987
WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT--

07:34.021 --> 07:36.056
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH DR. LAHIRI

07:36.089 --> 07:38.592
OR THIS BASKETBALL TEAM
I MADE YOU JOIN TWO DAYS AGO?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.127
[beep]

07:40.160 --> 07:42.930
DR. C?
DAMN IT!

07:42.963 --> 07:43.997
OKAY, WELL,
DR. C'S OUT.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.099
AND WITHOUT A THIRD PERSON,
WE HAVE TO FORFEIT.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.635
TAMRA, GIVE ME
YOUR JOCKSTRAP.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.936
OH, NO, NO, NO,
WE CAN'T JUST QUIT.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
WE CAN FIND ANOTHER PLAYER.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.238
YOU BETTER FIND ONE.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.641
I GOT A LOTTA DO-RE-MI
ON THIS GAME.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.042
HEY, DR. P,
YOU PLAY BASKETBALL.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.144
JUST A PICK-UP GAME
I PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS.

07:57.177 --> 08:01.048
MOSTLY...IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE
FOR ME TO USE BLACK SLANG.

08:01.081 --> 08:01.849
'SCUSE ME, BLOOD.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.984
DR. P., THIS TEAM
MEANS A LOT TO ME.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.954
AND AS AN AT-RISK YOUTH,
THIS BASKETBALL PROGRAM

08:06.987 --> 08:09.923
IS REALLY THE ONLY THING I HAVE
KEEPING ME OFF THE STREETS.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.692
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LIE
BUT ALSO SOMETHING

08:11.725 --> 08:14.127
THAT I WOULD GET IN TROUBLE
IF I SAY NO TO, SO FINE.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.863
YES! WHOO!

08:15.896 --> 08:17.731
(Rob)
HEY!
(Danny)
THERE HE IS.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.833
AW!
DAN THE MAN!

08:19.867 --> 08:21.101
COME HERE, YOU!

08:21.134 --> 08:22.670
AH!

08:22.703 --> 08:24.071
ROB THE MAN!

08:24.104 --> 08:25.973
THAT'S WHAT I USED TO
CALL HIM BACK IN MED SCHOOL.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.274
I CAME UP WITH IT, MIN.
HE DID.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.242
IT'S A LOT LIKE
DAN THE MAN.
NAW, IT'S DIFFERENT.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.078
LOOK AT YOU!
HOW'S EVERYTHING? OKAY?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.013
OH, AMAZING. LOOK,
THIS GUY RIGHT HERE--

08:33.046 --> 08:33.814
TAUGHT ME HOW TO BREW.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.749
THIS GUY TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DRINK.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.751
woman: HA HA HA!
NOT ANYMORE.

08:37.785 --> 08:38.986
ONE BEER, AND HE PASSES OUT,

08:39.019 --> 08:40.821
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT WAKES HIM UP

08:40.854 --> 08:41.889
IS HIS BLADDER.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.991
THAT'S MY LOVELY WIFE
BARB.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.830
ROB, I THINK YOU AND MINDY
ARE REALLY GONNA HIT IT OFF.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.164
YOU SHOULD HANG OUT.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.900
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TAKE HER TO ALCATRAZ.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.668
OH, I WOULD LOVE THAT.
WHAT IS THAT?

08:54.702 --> 08:57.838
IT'S THE WORLD'S
MOST FAMOUS MARRIAGE.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.172
I MEAN PRISON.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.008
[light chuckle]

09:01.041 --> 09:02.142
BARBARA HAS A RAZOR-SHARP WIT.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.812
I ALWAYS SAY, IF SHE'D
JUST STUCK WITH THE WRITING--

09:04.845 --> 09:06.747
WITH WHAT TIME? WITH YOU
WORKING ALL HOURS IN THE LAB,

09:06.780 --> 09:07.948
WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE
OF OUR HOME?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.149
[whispering]
WE HAVE NO CHILDREN.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.318
WE HAVE A RABBIT,
AND THAT'S HARDER

09:11.351 --> 09:13.153
BECAUSE IT CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT WANTS.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.923
THAT'S OKAY--I DON'T NEED
TO GO TO ALCATRAZ.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.224
YOU KNOW, ROB, I'M NOT
TOO HAPPY WITH YOU

09:17.257 --> 09:19.927
TAKING MINDY AWAY FROM US
FOR EIGHT MONTHS.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.062
I MEAN, EIGHT MONTHS
WITHOUT THIS ONE?

09:22.095 --> 09:23.363
BEST SURGEON
IN THE PRACTICE.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.833
REALLY? 'CAUSE SHE HAS
THE ENERGY OF A PR WOMAN

09:25.866 --> 09:27.134
FOR AN ALCOHOL BRAND.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.302
I HEAR YOU, BUT WAIT
TILL YOU SEE HER TECHNIQUE.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.972
I MEAN, HER STITCHES--
MM. BARELY PERCEPTIBLE.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.373
I HAD NO FRIENDS
IN SEVENTH GRADE,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.909
SO I HAD TIME TO MASTER
THE CROSS-STITCH.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.210
I HAVE TO CHECK
THAT OUT.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.146
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE PRACTICE IS GONNA DO

09:39.179 --> 09:40.347
WITHOUT HER.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.215
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO WITHOUT HER.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.124
WOW, THAT IS SO
SELF-SACRIFICING

09:51.158 --> 09:53.060
THAT YOU WOULD LET MINDY
MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

09:53.093 --> 09:55.162
TO PURSUE HER DREAMS.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.166
OH, HELLO.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.801
HI.

10:02.770 --> 10:06.139
(Rob)
BROCCOLI AND BROCCOLINI?
WHAT A RESTAURANT.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.140
YOU GUYS READY TO EAT?

10:07.174 --> 10:09.042
OH, YEAH.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.610
[giggles]

10:11.845 --> 10:12.980
(Morgan)
ALL RIGHT, POT IT.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.115
POT IT.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.950
[all cheering]

10:16.984 --> 10:19.186
YOU WERE WATCHING
THE GAME TAPE I SENT YOU.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.154
THE WAS JUST A VHS COPY
OF SPACE JAM.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.690
GOOD, THOUGH.
GOOD STUFF.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.857
SO WHAT'S UP, MORGAN?

10:23.891 --> 10:25.959
YOU WANNA MAYBE GRAB
A BITE AFTER THIS?

10:25.993 --> 10:28.061
OH, I CAN'T, I'M...

10:28.095 --> 10:29.763
HANGING OUT WITH JESSICA.
HI.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.264
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.066
WHO YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

10:33.100 --> 10:36.704
I'M JESSICA.
I'M HIS FRIEND WITH BENEFITS.

10:36.737 --> 10:37.905
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

10:37.938 --> 10:38.906
OH, BOY.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.708
CHRISTMAS...ISH.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.376
WHEN I WAS ON MY HABITAT
FOR HUMANITY TRIP?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.679
I'M OUT THERE HUGGING
BAREFOOT ASS APPALACHIAN KIDS

10:45.713 --> 10:47.715
AND MEANWHILE,
YOU'RE DATING A "JERSSICA"?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.683
WHICH ISN'T EVEN
A REAL NAME!
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.951
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.
JUST--IT'S COOL.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.086
LOOK, WE BROKE UP
LIKE A MONTH AGO.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.888
YOU WENT ON A WHOLE BUNCH
OF DATES WITH BIT PULL.

10:54.922 --> 10:55.956
YOU KNOW WHAT, MORGAN?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.925
I THINK I'M OFF
THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.359
NO, TAM, WE NEED Y--

10:59.392 --> 11:01.995
GREAT! THE ONE PERSON
WHO WATCHED SPACE JAM QUIT!

11:03.330 --> 11:05.032
MM...THIS CHEESECAKE
IS PRETTY GOOD.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.968
IT'S REAL GOOD.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.436
REALLY UNEXPECTED.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.839
NOT THAT UNEXPECTED.
I MEAN, I ORDERED IT.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.106
OH, BOY.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.307
[clears throat]

11:14.341 --> 11:16.243
DO I LOVE
THE CHEESECAKE HERE.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.444
YEAH.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.112
REALLY? YOU USED TO
HATE DESSERT.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.214
YOU SAID DESSERT WAS
WEAKNESS ENTERING THE BODY.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.116
YEAH.
I LIKE THAT...

11:23.150 --> 11:24.117
CHEESECAKE.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.452
WEIRD.
[Rob laughs]

11:25.485 --> 11:27.020
PEOPLE CHANGE, I GUESS.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.789
YOU KNOW, MINDY,
I STILL HAVE

11:28.822 --> 11:29.823
THAT PROCEDURE TOMORROW,

11:29.857 --> 11:33.961
AND I HAVEN'T PICKED
A FELLOW TO ASSIST ME YET.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.096
WOULD YOU BE...INTERESTED?

11:36.129 --> 11:38.298
OH, MY GOSH!
I LOVE THIS.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.733
YEAH, I WOULD LOVE THAT.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.101
MAYBE I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.303
AND IF DAN VOUCHES FOR YOU...

11:43.336 --> 11:44.972
HEY, MAN, ARE YOU TIRED?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.907
[whispering]
YEAH, I'M ABOUT TO BE.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.075
[Rob laughs]
I HEAR THAT.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.810
THIS IS A BIG FRUIT SALAD.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.044
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU'RE VERY SWEATY.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.512
[low and throaty]
I'M FINE.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.981
WOW, I'M FULL.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.485
WHEW! THAT'S A DAMN
GOOD CHEESECAKE.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.020
OH, I GOT A LITTLE
RASPBERRY ON ME.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.288
CAN I BORROW YOUR NAPKIN?

12:01.321 --> 12:02.422
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, ROB.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.423
YOU CAN
HAVE MINE.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.925
THANK YOU, MINDY.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.293
ALREADY ASSISTING.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.360
[both chuckle]

12:09.562 --> 12:10.931
I THINK THEY'RE KIND OF
A COOL COUPLE.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.466
WE SHOULD HANG OUT
WITH THEM AGAIN.
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
GOOD NIGHT.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.102
HEY, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.870
THE ONLY REASON HE ASKED ME
TO DO THAT SURGERY

12:16.904 --> 12:17.871
WAS BECAUSE OF YOU.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.372
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU

12:19.406 --> 12:21.441
AFTER THAT FANCY FOOTWORK
BACK THERE.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.976
HUH? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:23.010 --> 12:24.377
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME
AND YOUR FOOT

12:24.411 --> 12:26.146
MAKING HOT FIRE
UNDERNEATH THE TABLE.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.815
WHAT?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.285
YOU CHEATED ON ME!

12:32.319 --> 12:33.821
I THOUGHT IT WAS
YOUR FOOT!

12:33.854 --> 12:34.988
OH, COME ON, DANNY.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.824
YOU KNOW THAT MY TALONS
WOULD HAVE TORN YOU TO SHREDS!

12:36.857 --> 12:39.226
I JUST FEEL BAD FOR ROB.
I MEAN, HE'S GONNA KILL US.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.560
OH, WE'RE NOT TELLING
ROB!

12:40.593 --> 12:41.962
WHAT, SO HE CAN
HATE ME AGAIN?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.797
DANNY, THIS IS
ALL YOUR FAULT!

12:43.831 --> 12:45.132
MY FAULT?
YEAH!

12:45.165 --> 12:47.134
I DON'T THINK SO.
I REARRANGED MY ENTIRE SCHEDULE

12:47.167 --> 12:48.802
FOR THE WORST DINNER
OF MY LIFE

12:48.836 --> 12:50.804
BECAUSE YOU BEGGED ME
TO COME BACK HERE.

12:50.838 --> 12:51.872
HOW IS IT MY FAULT?

12:51.905 --> 12:54.174
I ONLY ARRANGED ALL THIS
BECAUSE YOU KEPT OFFERING

12:54.207 --> 12:55.943
TO PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ME,
DANNY.
YEAH.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.845
OKAY? YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I THINK DEEP DOWN

12:57.878 --> 13:01.081
YOU DON'T THINK THAT I CAN
DO THIS BY MYSELF.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.883
YEAH, MAYBE I DON'T.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.285
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT A FEELING

13:05.318 --> 13:08.956
YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO IT
BY YOURSELF EITHER, MIN.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.930
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.298
STOP PACKING.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.001
I'M GONNA TRY TO CATCH
THE RED-EYE BACK TO NEW YORK.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.473
THANK YOU, DR. REED,

13:26.506 --> 13:27.875

OH, MY PLEASURE.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.566
THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT MEANS.
OKAY, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.667
IT MEANS TIME OUT!
I DON'T KNOW THE RULES.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.114
(Morgan)
TRAVEL. TRAVEL. THAT'S TRAVEL.
NO! [twirr]

14:41.148 --> 14:43.050
I HAD MY HAND OUT.
YOU HAVE TO DRIBBLE
THE BALL.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.952
(Dr. Reed)
I'M VERY TIRED.
HERE WE GO.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.353
FOUL! FOUL!

14:46.386 --> 14:48.021
FOUL, FOUL!
[buzzer]

14:49.990 --> 14:52.425
HELLO. I'D LIKE TO ORDER
11 CHEESEBURGERS, PLEASE.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.562
OH, NEEPA.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:55.595 --> 14:58.065
[chuckles]
OH, I'M DOING RESEARCH
FOR A PART IN A PLAY.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.033
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING? I WORK HERE.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.502
OKAY. WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
WITH ME, MAN?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.938
I'M ONLY EVER
EXTREMELY NICE TO YOU!

15:04.972 --> 15:06.673
YOU ARE MY PROBLEM.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.076
ALL YOU SPOILED SECOND
GENERATIONS CARE ABOUT

15:09.109 --> 15:11.211
ARE SEX POSITIONS
AND NAIL ART.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.180
YOU ALWAYS TRY TO TAKE
THE EASY WAY OUT,

15:13.213 --> 15:15.182
AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.950
FOR SOME OF US,
THERE IS NO EASY WAY.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.052
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M A SPOILED SECOND GENERATION?

15:19.086 --> 15:20.287
WELL, GUESS WHAT, HONEY?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.022
NEIL'S GONNA BE
AN OUTDOOR POOL DJ IN VEGAS!

15:22.055 --> 15:23.056
NO!
OH, YEAH!

15:23.090 --> 15:25.158
NO--HE WOULD NEVER
DO THAT--

15:25.192 --> 15:27.995
IN GWALIOR, THEY CUT OFF
YOUR HAND FOR THAT!

15:29.229 --> 15:30.697
[whispers]
WOW.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.632
ALL RIGHT...THIS IS BAD.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
DO THEY HAVE MORE POINTS?
YES.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.037
DO THEY HAVE MORE SKILL?
YEAH.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.973
BUT DO THEY HAVE MORE
HEART?

15:40.007 --> 15:42.742
YES. AND THAT IS WHY
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE...

15:42.775 --> 15:44.011
RIGHT NOW.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.245
WHAT--WE'RE LOSING?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.015
I THOUGHT THE AIM WAS TO SCORE
THE LEAST POINTS LIKE GOLF.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.416
YOU THINK I CARE WHAT
THE SCOREBOARD SAY?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.151
IT COULD BE 200 TO 2!
I DON'T CARE!

15:51.184 --> 15:53.753
GET OUT THERE AND KILL THEM!

15:53.786 --> 15:57.257
[Tamra continues shouting]
NO. WE'RE NOT QUITTING.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.026
DR. P, WHY YOU--

15:59.059 --> 16:01.361
HEY, BOBBY KNIGHT,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.463
THIS IS A FUNDRAISER
FOR IBS.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.065
I THINK THERE'S
A SECRET REASON

16:05.098 --> 16:06.399
WHY YOU PUT THIS GAME
TOGETHER

16:06.433 --> 16:07.667
AND WHY YOU'RE PLAYING
SO HARD.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.736
'CAUSE I'M MAD MORGAN'S
DATING SOMEONE ELSE,

16:09.769 --> 16:10.670
AND I WANNA EMBARRASS HIM.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.372
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE

16:12.405 --> 16:14.441
A LITTLE MORE BELOW
THE SURFACE, SO I--

16:14.474 --> 16:17.010
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS LIKE, DR. P.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.311
I'M IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

16:18.345 --> 16:20.113
WHO WORKS
IN THE SAME HOSPITAL,

16:20.147 --> 16:23.316
AND NOW HE'S DATING THIS COOL,
ATTRACTIVE DOCTOR.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.787
TAMRA, THAT LITERALLY
JUST HAPPENED TO ME.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.423
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
DO YOU NOT LISTEN
TO ANYTHING

16:30.457 --> 16:32.259
OR PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING
I DO OR SAY?

16:32.292 --> 16:33.626
I GUESS I DON'T.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.794
LOOK, DR. P,

16:34.827 --> 16:36.396
THE ONLY REASON
I JOINED THIS TEAM

16:36.429 --> 16:38.531
WAS 'CAUSE IT WAS AN EXCUSE
TO HANG OUT WITH MORGAN,

16:38.565 --> 16:40.567
AND NOW HE'S NOT EVEN
NOTICING ME,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.702
SO I HAVE TO CRUSH HIM.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.537
YOU WANNA BE
THE BIGGER PERSON?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.206
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW--

16:46.239 --> 16:48.075
YOU GOTTA STOP MAKING
YOUR EX LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.509
IT ONLY LOOKS BAD ON YOU.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.111
BUT IT LOOKS GOOD ON ME.
I'M WINNING,

16:51.144 --> 16:53.413
AND I LOOK HOT IN THESE
CHILDREN'S BASKETBALL SHORTS.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.282
LOOK, YOU WANNA MOVE ON?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.584
STOP DUNKING
ON YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.358
MINDY!

17:05.392 --> 17:07.360
HEY. OH, GOD,

17:07.394 --> 17:08.761
I HAD A GREAT TIME
LAST NIGHT.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.463
BARB WAS IN
SUCH A GOOD MOOD,

17:10.497 --> 17:11.631
[whispers]
WE ALMOST HAD SEX!

17:11.664 --> 17:14.301
OH...
HEY, UM...

17:14.334 --> 17:16.303
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME SPECIAL TREATMENT

17:16.336 --> 17:17.637
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.705
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.740
MINDY, I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.742
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
SPECIAL TREATMENT.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.244
DID YOU JUST WINK
AT ME?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.612
NO!

17:25.645 --> 17:27.614
OKAY, DAMN IT.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS.

17:27.647 --> 17:28.748
I DIDN'T WANT TO,
BUT HERE IT IS.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.684
LAST NIGHT, YOUR WIFE'S FOOT
HAD SEX WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.486
'SCUSE ME?
SHE IS STEPPING OUT
ON YOU.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.687
I DID NOT MEAN FOR THAT
TO BE A PUN,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.156
BUT IT SURE WORKS.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.590
IF THE SHOES FITS.
THERE.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.858
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
A REAL FERTILE AREA.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.328
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!

17:41.361 --> 17:43.330
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.332
[muttering]
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

17:45.365 --> 17:46.399
BECAUSE YOU'RE WEEPING
SO MUCH.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.268
BARBARA! BARBARA!

17:48.301 --> 17:49.802
NO, NO, NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.804
BARBARA! I'M COMING, BARB!
I'M SO SORRY.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.640
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
BARBARA!

17:53.673 --> 17:54.774
[sobbing, muttering]
[horn honks]

17:54.807 --> 17:55.775
AAH!

17:55.808 --> 17:57.444
AAH! DR. GURGLER!

18:00.347 --> 18:01.348
(Rob)
OW!

18:01.381 --> 18:02.549
DANNY SAID
YOU WERE GOOD AT THIS.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.251
OR WAS THAT A LIE TOO?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.718
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY UPSET

18:05.752 --> 18:07.720
ABOUT THE STUFF WITH
YOUR WIFE,

18:07.754 --> 18:09.222
BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.
OH, PLEASE.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.823
I SAW THOSE PANTS
DANNY WAS WEARING.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.192
THEY WERE PRACTICALLY
SPRAYED ON.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.560
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT IS MY FAULT.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.562
I SECRETLY...TAKE IN
HIS PANTS AT THE CROTCH

18:15.595 --> 18:17.497
TO ACCENTUATE HIS BULGE.
BUT NEVER MIND!

18:17.530 --> 18:19.232
EVER SINCE I STARTED
THIS PROGRAM,

18:19.266 --> 18:20.667
YOU'VE BEEN SO MEAN
TO ME.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.302
I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M THIS SPOILED BRAT

18:22.335 --> 18:24.137
WITH AN ASS THAT'S ALL THAT,
BUT I'M NOT.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.705
I'M SMART.
HENCE, THAT COOL RHYME.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.607
I--
AND I KNOW I DIDN'T COME
FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY,

18:27.640 --> 18:29.609
BUT I HAD TO SACRIFICE
A LOT TOO.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.312
LIKE NEEPA OR PRAMOOD
OR GAMORRA

18:32.345 --> 18:34.181
OR GROOT
OR ROCKET THE RACCOON.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.183
I THINK SOME OF THOSE ARE
GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.485
AND SOME OF THEM AREN'T,
ROB, ALL RIGHT?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.520
I JUST WANNA WORK
REALLY HARD

18:40.553 --> 18:43.590
AND BE TREATED LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.657
OKAY.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.527
THANK YOU.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.631
THERE.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.805
WHOA!

18:58.838 --> 19:00.740
GOD, THOSE STITCHES
ARE GORGEOUS!

19:02.475 --> 19:03.443
OH, GOD!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.646
I GOT THE INTRAFALLOPIAN
TRANSFER IN TEN MINUTES!

19:06.679 --> 19:07.847
I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS!

19:07.880 --> 19:10.317
WAIT, C-COULD--
CAN YOU DO IT?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.884
WOW, ME?

19:11.918 --> 19:14.887
IMAGINE, ME...
THE CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS...

19:14.921 --> 19:16.256
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

19:16.289 --> 19:17.590
OKAY, NOBODY.
I'M SO SORRY.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.791
(Peter)
MORGAN, I'M OPEN!

19:18.825 --> 19:19.826
I GOTTA SCORE ONE.

19:19.859 --> 19:20.827
THEN DO IT!

19:20.860 --> 19:21.761
I'M 0 FOR 47.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.530
(Carolyn)
TAMRA, BLOCK HIM!

19:23.563 --> 19:24.964
TAMRA, YOU'RE BETTER
THAN THIS.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.566
TAMRA, NO MERCY!

19:26.599 --> 19:28.568
crowd:
FOUR, THREE...
TAKE YOUR SHOT.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.237
TWO...ONE.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.838
[buzzer]

19:31.871 --> 19:34.674
OH!

19:34.707 --> 19:36.876
SCHOOLED YOU! YEAH!

19:36.909 --> 19:38.611
TAMRA, YOU HUNGRY.
YEAH, OF COURSE.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.514
I JUST BURNED 100,000 CALORIES
CRUSHING IT.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.517
WAIT.
ARE YOU ASKING ME OUT?

19:44.551 --> 19:45.885
NO, I JOINED MORGAN'S
WORST NIGHTMARE

19:45.918 --> 19:47.554
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
WE COULD GO PRO.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.522
COME ON.
OKAY.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.458
OKAY.
AFTER YOU.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.527
EVERYONE, STOP!
STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

19:54.561 --> 19:55.562
EVERYONE STOP RIGHT NOW.

19:55.595 --> 19:56.729
THERE'S BEEN
A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.964
DR. GURGLER IS DEAD.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.566
[gasps and murmurs]
WHAT?

19:59.599 --> 20:01.268
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I SAID THAT--I'M NERVOUS.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.602
HE'S NOT DEAD.
BUT...

20:02.635 --> 20:06.005
HE DID ASK ME TO COVER
FOR HIM FOR THE SURGERY.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.508
BUT I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD DO IT.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.543
I THINK NEEPA SHOULD
DO IT INSTEAD.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.678
REALLY?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.980
I DIDN'T EARN THIS WEEK.
YOU DID.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.649
THANK YOU, MINDY.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.535
Danny: OW!
AAH! AAH!

20:35.568 --> 20:36.569
OH, MY GOD!

20:36.603 --> 20:37.970
YOU SAT ON ME!

20:38.004 --> 20:39.572
YEAH, AND I FARTED
ON YOU TOO!

20:39.606 --> 20:41.341
DAMN IT, DANNY!

20:41.374 --> 20:42.542
THANK GOD I DIDN'T
UNPACK MY GUN--

20:42.575 --> 20:43.876
YOU'D BE DEAD BY NOW.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.845
COME HERE.
GOD...

20:50.417 --> 20:52.419
LOOK, I WAS BOARDING
THE PLANE,

20:52.452 --> 20:53.820
AND I THOUGHT,
IF THIS THING GOES DOWN,

20:53.853 --> 20:56.689
I DIDN'T WANT OUR LAST
CONVERSATION TO BE A FIGHT.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.492
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO STAY HERE,

20:59.526 --> 21:00.560
I CAN GO BACK
TO THIS PLACE...

21:00.593 --> 21:02.695
THE CASTRO,
LIKE A MEN'S HOTEL.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.697
THEY SEEM REALLY NICE.

21:04.731 --> 21:05.865
WHAT?
FOR SOME REASON,

21:05.898 --> 21:08.067
THEY WERE REALLY LIKE,
"COME IN, COME IN!"

21:08.100 --> 21:10.703
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
YOU'RE NOT STAYING THERE.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.939
I DO WANT YOU
TO BE HERE.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.874
AND WHAT I REALIZED
IS THAT

21:14.907 --> 21:17.276
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO BE HERE.

21:19.846 --> 21:23.015
TAYLOR, COVER YOUR EYES.

21:24.984 --> 21:29.055
[light music]
