And that <i>wraps it up</i>

00:46.547 --> 00:48.467
<i>for today's pop culture
and celebrity news.</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:51.509
<i>Now, let's throw it over
to our very own Nikki Boyer</i>

00:51.593 --> 00:53.643
<i>for this week's
"where are they now?" Segment.</i>

00:57.641 --> 00:59.691
In tonight's
"where are they now?" Segment,

00:59.768 --> 01:02.728
we take a look at
child star Gavin stone.

01:02.813 --> 01:05.072
Twenty years ago, stone shot
to small-screen stardom

01:05.147 --> 01:08.068
<i>as cliffy in the smash
sitcom family life.</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:10.241
And had seemingly
every kid in America saying...

01:10.320 --> 01:11.860
Don't look at me.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.277
<i>His legendary manager,
star maker, Jack Roth,</i>

01:14.366 --> 01:17.236
<i>parlayed that into
merchandise, a cliffy DVD,</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:20.077
<i>and after family life's
cancellation,</i> a <i>couple of movies.</i>

01:20.163 --> 01:22.373
And then, tragedy struck.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.417
The unexpected
death of Gavin's mother

01:24.501 --> 01:27.051
ultimately led to
a messy emancipation

01:27.129 --> 01:29.669
from his now
estranged father, Waylon.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.626
<i>Exercising his newfound freedom,</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:34.427
<i>Gavin became a fixture
on the party scene.</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:38.391
But, five years ago, his fast
living finally caught up with him.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.353
<i>After consecutive
stints in rehab,</i>

01:40.434 --> 01:42.644
<i>stone has been mostly
out of the public eye.</i>

01:42.728 --> 01:44.898
<i>Otherwise,
his career has stalled.</i>

01:44.980 --> 01:48.610
Even his former director and creator
of <i>family life,</i> Mike Meara,

01:48.692 --> 01:52.572
reportedly didn't even audition
stone for Meara's new TV series.

01:52.696 --> 01:56.526
Ouch. It looks like his career
will remain quiet for a while,

01:56.617 --> 01:58.827
much to the delight
of movie critics.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.370
So there you have it,
"where is he now?"

02:03.415 --> 02:06.335
<i>Gavin, I'm your manager,
not</i> a <i>miracle worker.</i>

02:06.418 --> 02:07.838
<i>The party went
too far this time.</i>

02:07.919 --> 02:10.378
You trashed
the entire rooftop of a hotel.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.051
Take a look.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.342
Memory still failing you?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.717
Is that a catapult?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.055
Yes.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.389
Gavin, listen,
the damage is your fault.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.019
This judge won't budge
on community service.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.693
Community service?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.572
Maintenance at a local church.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.065
Church?

02:30.317 --> 02:34.197
Like, god and choirs
and all that?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.739
Or sewage cleanup.

02:36.073 --> 02:39.283
Is there a difference?
Gavin. Take the deal.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.368
Spend 200 hours of your life doing
something positive for a change.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.794
In Masonville, Illinois?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.123
I got out of here for a reason.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.498
Please, guys, remind me
never to visit again.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.085
You got no choice, okay?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.400
So, I want you
to deal with this,

02:51.421 --> 02:52.661
and I want you to make it work.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.094
Reconnect with your old man.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.350
You're gonna need
a place to stay.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.928
I prefer jail.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.813
Okay, fine.
The church thing.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.435
Be on time, be respectful.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.225
You listening?
Yes.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.855
Don't screw this up.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.362
How could I?

03:13.443 --> 03:14.993
I'll fit right in.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.923
<i>This is Mike Meara.
Who are you?</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:33.553
Hey, hey, Mikey. Gavin stone.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.010
Just wanted to see
if you needed, uh...

03:36.341 --> 03:37.381
Um...

03:37.467 --> 03:39.387
<i>To leave
your message, press two.</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:41.809
<i>To re-record, press three.</i>

03:45.392 --> 03:48.152
Mike, my man.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.148
Hey, still owe you that drink
from a few years back.

04:00.240 --> 04:05.580
Good day, Mr. Meara. I just
wanted to reintroduce myself.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.662
My name is Gavin stone.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.735
It'll be fine.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.453
He's your dad.
Just tell him what happened.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.820
Tell him you're sorry.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.624
He'll be fine.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.120
Well, thanks for the ride.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.578
Good luck.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.317
Dad.

05:24.908 --> 05:25.908
You in trouble?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.699
Uh...

05:28.495 --> 05:29.695
A little.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.713
What kind?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.087
The kind where you
can't leave the state

05:36.169 --> 05:38.379
until you've completed
your community service hours.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.923
What did you do this time?

05:40.507 --> 05:41.757
Long story.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.093
You clean?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.596
Yes.
Are you clean?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.979
Dad, yes.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.186
Been a while.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.784
Yeah. Yeah, it has.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.610
Place looks nice.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.121
No, it doesn't. Not yet.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.196
Well, you know,
you finished the outside...

06:09.286 --> 06:10.286
Eight years ago.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.131
Okay.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.669
Um, look, I'm just
gonna come out with it.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.634
I need a place to stay.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.256
Low on cash,
and I don't have a gig, so...

06:25.552 --> 06:27.182
Say what you need to say.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.603
It's been a one-man band
around here for a long time.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.226
Yeah, I know.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.151
But if you have a spare room,

06:41.151 --> 06:43.701
I promise
I'll stay out of your way.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.003
I don't have maid service.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.000
This isn't the motel 6.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.336
If you're out late, the
light's not left on for you.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.671
How long are you
gonna be around?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.666
Uh, two hundred hours.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.846
And unless you can drive me, I'm
gonna need to borrow the truck.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.269
The 16th birthday truck
that you turned down

07:12.349 --> 07:14.269
'cause you wanted to
buy a Vette, that truck?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.561
Yes, dad, that is the one.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.146
Have at it.
Thank you.

07:18.229 --> 07:23.109
Oh, I gotta be at Masonville Bible church.
You've ever been there?

07:23.193 --> 07:26.283
I go to about as many
church services as you do.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.697
Well, this should be fun.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.757
Come on.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.421
Thank you, father, for this
opportunity we have...

08:31.720 --> 08:34.640
Toto, we are not in
Los Angeles anymore.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.227
Hello?

08:45.650 --> 08:49.030
Hey, do you know
where the pastor's office is?

08:49.112 --> 08:50.282
I do.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.276
You're Gavin stone.
All right.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.871
Let's do it fast, man.
You got your phone?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.460
I'm sorry? I'm happy to do a selfie.
You're a fan, right?

08:59.998 --> 09:02.328
Of what?
Me, the show...

09:02.417 --> 09:04.497
I mean,
you recognized me, right?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.876
Should I?
How did you know my name?

09:07.714 --> 09:10.634
It was printed at
the top of your rap sheet.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.967
I'm Allan Richardson.
Pastor Allan Richardson.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.637
Ah.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.934
So, why are you fixing the...
Because it's broken.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.647
"Drink from your own
cistern." Proverb, sort of.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.360
And at 30 bucks an hour, always
better to fix it yourself.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.566
I didn't know pastors did that.

09:28.818 --> 09:32.068
Well, I guess you
haven't met many pastors.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.775
The catapult was a nice touch.
Quite a party, huh?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.987
They gave you the pictures.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.288
I've been a pastor for decades.
Nothing shocks me anymore.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.082
I really wasn't a part of...
Yeah, they told me the story.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.747
You're not the best decision
maker, but you're no criminal.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.086
So, we don't need to share
with anybody why you're here.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.862
It's a big church, you'll fly under the
radar, everybody'll treat you great.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.013
Okay. Got it.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.013
Gavin, we really do believe
in second chances here.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.136
But they're not
to be taken lightly.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.603
200 hours means 200 hours.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.603
And don't just think because
I'm the "caring pastor"

10:03.686 --> 10:05.396
that you're gonna
put one over on me.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.610
Got it?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.980
Got it.
Good.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.107
So, father...

10:11.569 --> 10:13.449
"Pastor" is fine.
Or just Allan.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.030
Okay. Yeah, Allan...

10:15.365 --> 10:16.655
Uh...

10:16.741 --> 10:19.081
What is it exactly
that I'll be doing?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.058
Ha!

10:43.685 --> 10:44.685
Hiya!

10:44.727 --> 10:45.897
Whoa.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.654
Uh...
What are you doing?

10:47.730 --> 10:48.900
Nothing.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.482
Sorry, I'm not, uh...

10:52.152 --> 10:54.072
You know, just cleaning.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.614
Where is Helen?

10:55.697 --> 10:58.987
I'm just filling in for Helen.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.945
Okay, well,
you need to put a sign

11:01.035 --> 11:02.825
because this is
the women's bathroom.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.212
Yup. Should have
done that, yeah.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.083
Do I know you from somewhere?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.251
You recognize me?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.426
I don't think I've seen you
around here before.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.126
You can figure it out later.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.344
Maybe over coffee
or deep-dish pizza.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.296
You guys are into that, right?
Really?

11:18.386 --> 11:22.016
Yeah, thin crust is fine, too.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.435
Uh... well,
I got a ton of work to do,

11:25.560 --> 11:28.270
and I've known you for 30 seconds, so...

11:29.647 --> 11:30.817
Ls that...

11:31.816 --> 11:33.476
Are these movie scenes?

11:33.568 --> 11:36.948
Uh, no. It is our annual
stage production.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.700
That's totally my thing.
I could help you with that.

11:39.782 --> 11:43.452
Right now, you can help me
by cleaning another bathroom.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.706
'Cause this is the women's.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.998
Yeah. Hmm.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.921
Yep. All right.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.380
I'll just get a sign.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.520
As well.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.815
I can sing, I can dance...

12:14.067 --> 12:15.987
Okay, next up is Charles.

12:23.952 --> 12:29.672
Woe to you, scribes and pharisees.
Woe to you.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.749
Hi. My name is Doug.
I've never acted before.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.375
But I'm willing to serve the lord
in whatever way you see fit.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.513
My name is
Charlotte Elizabeth Stewart.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.721
I'm the stage manager.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.142
And I'm going to be
performing amazing grace.

12:45.223 --> 12:50.443
My name is Anthony Mathias
Roundstone, and I live for Jesus.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.730
The stage is a close second.

12:53.815 --> 13:00.355
I'll be performing a monologue from
Henrik Ibsen's <i>a</i> doll's house.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.118
Finished already?

13:04.534 --> 13:05.584
You know what they say.

13:05.660 --> 13:09.000
Time flies when you're serving your
state-mandated community service hours.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.620
Eight down, 192 to go.

13:10.707 --> 13:14.957
You know, as naturally
gifted as I am with a mop,

13:15.044 --> 13:17.464
I'm 10 times better on stage.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.474
You think I could spend a few
of my hours working on this?

13:21.551 --> 13:23.271
Maybe help you guys out?
Oh, that'd be nice.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.893
But, uh, this is one
of our ministries.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.602
We ask that all cast members
be believing Christians.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.520
Well, lam one.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.569
You are what?
Christian.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.610
You're a Christian?
Yes.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.275
You are?
Yes.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.123
Really?
You didn't know that?

13:44.699 --> 13:46.010
I must have missed it
in your file

13:46.034 --> 13:47.664
between the drunk
and disorderly charges.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.076
Ah.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.500
Touché, touché.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.920
No, I'm Christian.
Capital c.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.420
I've had the passion of the
Christ for a couple of years now.

14:02.008 --> 14:06.388
As in, you believe that Jesus
Christ is the son of god?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.511
God.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.927
And that he's our savior?
Savior, yeah.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.226
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.190
I've had my share of
hiccups, as you know.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.607
A couple of nights ago,
was a mistake, obviously,

14:19.525 --> 14:22.105
but it's no mistake
that I chose to come here.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.655
Why didn't you tell me?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.703
I don't know. Just didn't
think you'd believe me.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.367
Not sure if you do now.
No, no. I...

14:34.290 --> 14:35.790
I didn't expect it.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.035
Just so you know,
newcomers are expected

14:38.127 --> 14:40.127
to share their testimony
when they audition.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.881
Oh.
Okay?

14:41.964 --> 14:43.634
Done that plenty of times.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.386
No, I don't mean
the kind you do in court.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.845
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.733
Okay. Okay?

14:52.809 --> 14:53.979
Of course.
All right.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.478
All right.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.783
All right.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.779
Christian testimony.
Christian testimony.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.994
Bono? But he's so cool.

15:09.242 --> 15:14.622
Hello. My name is John mark. And I'm
auditioning for the role of Peter...

15:14.705 --> 15:15.745
Uh, hi.
Hi.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.582
I'm Gavin, I'm here for Jesus.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.417
Oh, that's sweet.
Me, too.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.380
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That, too.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.505
Uh, no, I'm here for the role of Jesus.
Oh. Oh! Uh...

15:25.591 --> 15:28.471
John mark is going up now, and
you can go on up after him.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.053
Okay. Oh...

15:31.097 --> 15:32.097
Got it.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.441
Go quickly and tell his
disciples that he has risen.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.643
Thank you.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.396
Thank you.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.689
Okay, is that it?
No, no.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.778
Great job, buddy.
Oh, gosh.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.860
Should I stand here?
Yeah, that's fine.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.235
Since this is your first time,

15:47.321 --> 15:49.241
we ask that you
share a little bit...

15:49.323 --> 15:51.373
Ah, my testimony.
Yes, yes.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.851
That's Gavin stone. Gavin:
Pastor Allan mentioned that.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.222
Then go right ahead and then you can
go into your reading after that.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.536
All right, all right.
Let's do this.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.788
Hi, everybody. Um...

16:00.877 --> 16:04.207
As you probably already know,
my name is Gavin stone.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.587
Oh... that's where I recognized him from.
What is he doing here?

16:07.675 --> 16:11.465
But what you probably didn't
know is that I'm a Christian.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.474
I wasn't until a few years ago

16:13.556 --> 16:17.556
when I hit rock-bottom and
just felt something missing.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.306
Guess you could call
it a god-shaped hole.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.731
So, I came to a place

16:23.816 --> 16:29.106
where I decided to climb
that stairway to heaven

16:29.822 --> 16:32.532
and let Jesus take the wheel.

16:32.617 --> 16:38.247
And ultimately, uh,
hey, let go and let god.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.749
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.291
I'm still a bit new to it, too.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.995
Forgive me if I don't always
get the details perfect.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.417
- Uh...
- Thank you.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.094
If I may ask, what are you
doing here in Masonville?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.299
Well, this is my hometown.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.928
I had a bit of
a rough patch recently.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.934
And ultimately, I had no choice
but to come home to my father.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.357
Anyway, I thought,
"hey, while I was here,

17:02.438 --> 17:04.728
"I could help out
on stage, too."

17:04.815 --> 17:08.025
So, I'm auditioning for
the role of Jesus Christ.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.742
Superstar.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.818
Theater joke. Anyway, uh, this
is a speech from Hamlet.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.535
He's anguished and alone
after his father's death.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.955
O, that this too too
solid flesh would melt,

17:28.130 --> 17:31.880
thaw, and resolve
itself into a dew!

17:32.885 --> 17:35.715
Or that the everlasting
had not fix'd

17:35.805 --> 17:38.175
his canon
'gainst self-slaughter!

17:39.350 --> 17:46.270
How weary, stale,
flat, and unprofitable,

17:46.357 --> 17:49.987
seems to me all
the uses of this world!

17:51.571 --> 17:57.201
Fie on't! Oh fie, fie!
'Tis an unweeded garden,

17:57.285 --> 18:02.075
that grows to seed, things
rank and gross in nature

18:02.164 --> 18:05.294
possess it merely.
That it should come to this!

18:06.168 --> 18:11.918
But two months dead!
Nay, not so much, not two.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.338
Okay, thank you.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.513
I had... I had more.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.715
That's okay.
We got it. Very good.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.642
Good'? That was incredible.
Okay.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.015
Good.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.555
- Awesome!
- Nice.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.364
- Okay. Thank you.
- Whoo!

18:30.109 --> 18:31.279
Whoo-hoo!

18:38.117 --> 18:40.287
So, why didn't he tell us?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.329
I told him what I tell
everybody who does this.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.043
Nobody needs to know the
details of why you're here.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.338
So, you saw it? I was
watching from the back.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.709
He's very good.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.126
Yes, dad, he's good.
Obviously.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.455
But do we really want the most
important part of the play

18:55.509 --> 18:56.719
to be done by a newcomer?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.972
Especially somebody who
brings all this attention.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.305
Since when is attention
a bad thing for a play?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.480
But he seems so cocky.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.638
I'd love to not cast him
just to show him

19:04.727 --> 19:06.647
that he can't get what
he wants all the time.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.819
Look, hon, it's your call.
I trust you completely.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.649
But I will say this,
yes, he has his quirks

19:12.735 --> 19:14.815
and I'm not sure
he completely understands

19:14.904 --> 19:17.454
all the things
he says about his faith.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.491
But isn't this
why we do what we do?

19:19.950 --> 19:23.120
I think he needs us
as much as we need him.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.504
Uh... we need him?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.870
Sweetie,
I saw the other options.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.590
They weren't that bad.
They were horrible.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.940
What is happening?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.204
I'm opening my chi. And I've gotta
be loose for rehearsal tonight.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.869
Rehearsal?
Yeah.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.789
I got the lead in this big production
they're doing at the church.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.794
I'm playing Jesus.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.871
You as Jesus?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.510
Well, if you're not too tired from
all that acting you've been doing,

20:10.584 --> 20:12.174
give me a hand
unloading the truck.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.173
I also mopped a lot.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.217
Something useful.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.932
Acting is useful, dad.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.138
Yeah, it clearly paid off.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.811
Enjoy your Buddhist ballet.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.190
It's called yoga.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.348
Builds your core.

20:36.318 --> 20:40.448
Okay, people. Opening
night is six weeks away,

20:40.531 --> 20:43.241
so there's gonna be a lot of late
nights between then and now.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.405
The only way this works is if
we're together as a team, okay?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.905
So, let's just dive right in.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.367
Jesus, disciples,
you're up first.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.828
Let's do it.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.376
Okay. Yup, keep moving
it to the left.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.175
Yup, yup, yup-
stop, stop-

21:00.301 --> 21:02.851
hey, Gavin.
Hey.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.098
Your audition last night
was perfect.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.681
And I'm not just saying that because
you're playing the sinless son of god.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.313
Thank you. Thanks.
Little joke, but...

21:11.395 --> 21:16.145
I'm Anthony, and I am a leader
with the church SWAT program.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.443
SWAT?

21:17.526 --> 21:20.646
Yeah, students with a testimony.
Our youth group.

21:20.780 --> 21:25.160
Oh. Oh. I also am one
of your biggest fans.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.789
That's cool.

21:28.871 --> 21:35.671
Well, anyway, lam really looking
forward to working with you.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.553
I'm playing Peter.
Peter. Mmm.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.797
The first disciple. Basically, he's
known as the rock of the church.

21:42.885 --> 21:43.885
Oh...

21:44.220 --> 21:47.140
Disciples. Yeah, yeah.
The guys in the painting.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.433
I know it's an ensemble piece,

21:48.516 --> 21:49.976
but he's kinda
like the lead guy.

21:50.059 --> 21:54.229
Anyway, if you need anything. If you
wanna run lines or go for pizza...

21:54.313 --> 21:56.573
I'm kind of a local pro.
Semi-pro, I guess.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.229
All right, places, guys.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.136
Gavin, you're supposed
to be sleeping.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.204
Supposed to be
sleeping? Why?

22:07.284 --> 22:08.564
That's what it says
in the Bible.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.464
Oh! Right.
Yeah, I knew that.

22:13.374 --> 22:14.754
Here we go.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.344
Sleep on here? No.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.298
I'll sleep here.
I'll get it.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.921
And action.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.385
Quickly, to the nets.
We must hold on.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.258
Behold.
The tempest rises.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.386
Yet still our lord slumbers.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.524
Awaken him!

22:32.601 --> 22:35.021
Cue Gavin.
Gavin, it's your line.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.530
Oh, ye of little...

22:40.609 --> 22:42.029
I'm gonna say "you."

22:42.111 --> 22:44.951
Oh, you of little faith,
where is your courage?

22:45.281 --> 22:47.531
Peace, be still.

22:50.786 --> 22:55.416
Teacher, who are you that even
the wind and waves obey you?

22:55.499 --> 22:57.789
God most high!
Only god could do this.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.213
It is as you say.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.302
I think that line
should be even bigger.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.682
Let's just play it as written.

23:04.884 --> 23:10.894
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. But what
if as soon as you say...

23:10.973 --> 23:12.143
You say it.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.414
"Teacher, who are you..."
Hihateven the wind and waves...

23:14.435 --> 23:15.725
<i>Okay.
Sorry.</i>

23:15.811 --> 23:18.521
You kill the lights. Okay?

23:18.606 --> 23:20.856
You drop a single spot on me.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.941
I step out away from these guys,

23:23.027 --> 23:24.737
big hero moment for me.

23:24.820 --> 23:28.240
I am the Alpha and the omega,

23:28.324 --> 23:32.164
the beginning and
the end of all things.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.581
Cue pyro.
We can't do...

23:35.664 --> 23:40.674
And these waves obey the one
they recognize as their creator.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.326
I don't know.
Something like that?

23:46.300 --> 23:51.760
That is actually the exact
opposite of what Jesus was about.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.307
He wasn't an attention seeker.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.479
Really? I mean, why not?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.805
In short, humility.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.193
Don't you pick up on that
when you read the gospels?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.606
Well, yeah, you know,
when I read the gospels,

24:04.693 --> 24:07.823
I pick up on that
a little bit. Um...

24:08.530 --> 24:10.634
All right, trying to bring something
to the production, you know.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.288
Okay. Well, thank you. Let's
just do it again as written.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.199
And back to one, everyone.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.495
Just wanna say, great
first rehearsal. Yeah?

24:18.582 --> 24:20.352
And I have some thoughts
that might help you out.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.496
I think I've had enough
of your thoughts for today.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.586
How about tomorrow?
Lunch? Coffee maybe?

24:24.672 --> 24:26.132
No, thanks.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.193
It's lunch. What's the worst
thing that can happen?

24:28.217 --> 24:30.111
<i>I watched</i> your <i>e! True
Hollywood story last night.</i>

24:30.135 --> 24:32.175
So I can think of
about 10 worst things.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.932
Okay. But you see
how it is, right?

24:34.014 --> 24:35.564
I mean,
they need help out there.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.191
It's still early. The cast will
get it together in a few weeks.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.648
But they're so stiff.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.308
It's like they're in
a bad '40s melodrama.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.938
And you, you're so uptight.
You just need to relax.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.026
We've been doing this
for 15 years.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.607
That's why it's so stale.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.567
I gotta go. Believe
it or not, I'm late.

24:51.657 --> 24:52.987
Late? For what?

24:53.075 --> 24:55.275
One of my students left this,
and I have to drop it off.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.327
Give it to him tomorrow.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.392
No. If he doesn't get this
by bedtime in 10 minutes,

24:58.414 --> 24:59.964
he's not sleeping. Gotta run.

25:00.374 --> 25:03.884
Oh, oh. One more quick question.
This is important.

25:05.671 --> 25:06.671
What is that thing?

25:09.758 --> 25:11.548
It's a...

25:12.553 --> 25:13.553
I don't know what it is.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.137
Surely, it had
a face at one point.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.441
I have nine minutes.
Okay.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.440
So, I take it lunch is off.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.856
Don't sweat it.
We've been there.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.282
Where?

25:28.569 --> 25:30.449
In her dust.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.159
I haven't been there myself,
but from what I've seen,

25:34.241 --> 25:35.721
she's a pretty
tough woman to impress.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.624
I've been trying to court
her since the late '90s.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.367
Court her?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.211
What, are you
a Quaker or something?

25:42.458 --> 25:43.578
I was, yes.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.342
Oh. Sorry, dude.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.876
- What, you guys know a lot about her?
- Totally.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.296
You should come to Doug's.
We can fill you in.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.640
What's at Doug's? Just
some fellowship, brother.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.680
Fellowship?
It's our small group.

25:56.764 --> 25:57.974
We get together once a week.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.555
And do what? Where?
It's Masonville.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.233
Just relax, talk, pray.
You know, that kind of thing.

26:05.647 --> 26:06.647
Hmm.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.492
So, what do you think?
Ls it a bit much?

26:11.820 --> 26:12.860
Just a little.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.945
Fair enough.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.913
No, that's cool.
What do you guys do?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.953
You know, we show up
for church events,

26:20.037 --> 26:21.747
go to homeless shelters,
things like that.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.460
Yeah? Full time?
No.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.330
That was the old Doug. Bc.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.381
That was a much
different group of guys.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.591
We mostly do this just for fun.

26:29.671 --> 26:34.131
I'm basically now just a
mechanic and a family man.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.508
You want a brewski?
Can't. I'm sober.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.433
And the root beer
has processed sugar.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.943
I get you. You're keeping
the old temple pure.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.899
I'm trying.
Don't leave me hanging.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.019
Hey, hey.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.899
- It's here.
- Nice.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.106
Deep dish. Gavin, you
want to pray it up?

26:53.529 --> 26:54.529
Huh?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.783
Pray, before we crush this.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.372
Oh. Uh...

26:59.034 --> 27:01.334
Yeah, yeah. Let's...
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.248
Uh... all right, guys.
Let's take a knee.

27:10.546 --> 27:11.796
Dear god,

27:13.715 --> 27:16.585
as we head into battle each day...
Mmm-hmm.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.513
We know it will not be easy.
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.516
But even though our enemies,
like the devil,

27:23.767 --> 27:26.187
may try to take away our lives,

27:26.812 --> 27:30.152
they will never
take away our freedom.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.692
Oh. Yeah.

27:32.067 --> 27:36.907
And thank you
for this glorious feast

27:39.158 --> 27:43.118
of cheese and bread,
pizza and fellowship.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.123
Amen.
Amen.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.205
All right then.

27:48.542 --> 27:49.542
Whoa!

27:49.626 --> 27:51.036
Yeah, looks nice.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.714
I know.

27:57.759 --> 27:58.839
So, she can have fun.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.257
Kelly? Yeah, she's just
under a lot of stress.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.426
Especially being a pk.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.580
Pretend I don't know
what that means.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.930
Pk, pastor's kid.

28:07.728 --> 28:08.768
She's Allan's daughter?

28:08.896 --> 28:11.056
Yeah. I mean, she
basically runs half the church

28:11.148 --> 28:13.042
between the children's ministry
and now the production.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.986
Does she ever do anything
besides church stuff?

28:15.068 --> 28:16.948
Not that we know about.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.614
She's totally sold out.

28:18.739 --> 28:21.239
Mmm.
She sold what?

28:21.325 --> 28:23.365
She sold out to Jesus.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.372
First time I asked her
out about 10 years ago,

28:26.455 --> 28:28.433
she told me there's only room
in her life for one man,

28:28.457 --> 28:30.077
and that man was Jesus Christ.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.835
How do you measure up to that?
Yeah.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.127
You don't.

28:33.212 --> 28:37.382
Mmm. I tried. I dressed up
like Jesus at a church event.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.046
Totally had the opposite effect.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.137
Didn't go well.
Yeah, it was bad.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.639
She, like, ran away.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.102
He, like, talked to her...
He tried to woo her in Aramaic.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.270
Step one, go to church.

28:57.361 --> 29:02.121
Step two, wear the uniform.

29:24.638 --> 29:28.098
Good morning. Blessings.
Peace be to you.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.149
Good morning.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.777
Good morning.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.840
Good morning. Blessings.
Good morning.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.161
Blessings. Peace be to you.
Oh, thank you.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.529
Good morning.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.867
Peace be to both of you.
Okay...

29:45.951 --> 29:48.501
Blessings. Blessings.
Oh, my gosh.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.867
We have the same book.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.170
Gavin.
Gavin.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.552
Blessings.
Blessings to all of you.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.682
Hey, how are ya?
We're good.

30:02.759 --> 30:03.799
Hi. Hey, guys-

30:03.885 --> 30:05.095
so, where's Kelly?

30:05.178 --> 30:06.388
Why are you whispering?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.135
It's a church service.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.944
Where's Kelly?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.775
<i>God, show your power!</i>

30:25.741 --> 30:27.031
Blessings.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.580
<i>We've waited for this day</i>

30:30.662 --> 30:32.622
<i>we're gathered in your name</i>

30:33.415 --> 30:36.665
<i>calling out to you</i>

30:38.003 --> 30:40.263
<i>your glory like a fire</i>

30:40.339 --> 30:42.799
<i>awakening desire</i>

30:42.883 --> 30:46.263
<i>will burn our hearts with truth</i>

30:47.804 --> 30:49.514
<i>you're the reason we're here</i>

30:49.598 --> 30:51.218
<i>you're the reason we're here</i>

30:51.308 --> 30:52.478
yeah.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.939
<i>You're the reason we're singing</i>

30:57.105 --> 30:59.475
<i>open up the heavens
open up the heavens</i>

30:59.691 --> 31:02.111
<i>we want to see you
we want to see you</i>

31:02.319 --> 31:04.399
<i>open up the floodgates</i>

31:04.863 --> 31:07.533
<i>a mighty river a mighty river</i>

31:07.616 --> 31:09.866

31:09.951 --> 31:12.411

31:12.496 --> 31:14.956
<i>filling every part of our praise</i>

31:15.624 --> 31:17.464
ah, thank you.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.795
Here you go.
Thanks.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.670
This is my body, broken for you.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.802
Do this in remembrance of me.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.190
This is my blood

31:35.268 --> 31:37.728
shed for you
and for all mankind.

31:37.938 --> 31:40.858
Do this in remembrance of me.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.492
Lord, we thank you for all the
work you're doing in our church.

31:46.822 --> 31:50.122
We ask all this
in Jesus' name. Amen.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.326
Amen.

32:00.544 --> 32:02.804
Are we not supposed
to get up on that?

32:03.630 --> 32:06.510
Yeah.
Oh no, thanks.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.013
Can you just pass it on?

32:09.094 --> 32:11.304
Oh. Hey, blessings.
Good morning.

32:11.388 --> 32:13.518
Pass it to him.
Oh. Oh.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.678
Thank you.
Thank you.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.146
Let go of the rope,
and trust in Jesus.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.780
He will do a better job managing
your life than you ever will.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.404
It's been a joy
worshipping with you today.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.201
Have a great week.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.824
You are loved.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.487
You are loved.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.197
You are loved.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.973
Hey, we're gonna grab some lunch.
Do you wanna...

32:36.997 --> 32:38.787
Do you wanna come?
Oh!

32:39.583 --> 32:42.293
Lam exhausted.
Think I need a nap.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.547
Okay. Next time.
Thanks, guys. Blessings.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.262
Blessings to both of you.
He'll come next time.

32:48.341 --> 32:49.341
Yeah.
Yeah.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.047
We're falling a little behind.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.177
So we're gonna have to pick up
the pace tonight, you guys.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.227
Um, where's Gavin?

32:57.309 --> 32:58.349
Hey.

32:58.435 --> 32:59.725
Sorry. Sorry.

32:59.853 --> 33:00.853
Wow.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.437
I know, right?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.362
Hey, everybody.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.649
So, I got this great deal

33:07.736 --> 33:10.486
from this shop I've worked with before.
Didn't cost you anything.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.692
I figured I might as well
start diving into character.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.798
And it all starts
with the wardrobe, guys.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.332
Wow. I, uh...

33:18.580 --> 33:20.540
Okay, let's get started.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.584
Uh, nativity scene's up first.
Mary and Joseph.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.634
Nice.
Thanks.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.417
All right, boat scene is over.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.927
Soldiers,
you're up next, please.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.220
Are we really that bad?

33:33.929 --> 33:34.929
Hmm?

33:35.305 --> 33:37.715
Just shoot us straight.
How are we doing?

33:37.807 --> 33:40.687
You know, it could use
a little improvement.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.269
But it's okay.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.982
I knew it.
We're terrible!

33:44.064 --> 33:46.574
No. We're okay. Right?

33:48.109 --> 33:49.149
No.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.987
Wait a minute. So, "okay"
really means we're not good.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.782
Yeah. How can
we improve?

33:57.494 --> 33:59.414
All right. Follow me.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.958
He's gonna show us how to...

34:02.040 --> 34:03.630
Here's a chance of a lifetime.

34:04.417 --> 34:07.047
All right, first of all...

34:07.170 --> 34:10.170
Guys, we're not on stage
in the 16th century.

34:10.297 --> 34:12.547
Christians talk
so weird all the time.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.844
Don't they?
We... don't we?

34:14.928 --> 34:17.638
But all the great stuff
we have to say

34:17.722 --> 34:19.772
won't matter if
no one can understand us.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.938
Yeah, it's like
St. Francis of Assisi.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.402
"Preach the gospel, and
if necessary, use words."

34:27.940 --> 34:31.400
Yeah. Now,
John mark, Doug,

34:31.695 --> 34:33.630
you guys are stepping all
over each other's lines.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.341
Sorry about that. What are
we supposed to do because...

34:35.364 --> 34:36.592
This is what lam talking about.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.406
There's an old acting exercise
that I think might help. Okay?

34:39.494 --> 34:42.583
I want you to sing row, row,
row your boat on three.

34:42.664 --> 34:43.833
One, two...

34:43.873 --> 34:46.083
<i>Row, row, row your boat John".
Row, row, row your boat</i>

34:46.167 --> 34:48.087
<i>gently down the stream
gently down the stream</i>

34:48.168 --> 34:49.399
<i>merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily</i>

34:49.420 --> 34:50.610
<i>merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily</i>

34:50.630 --> 34:52.219
<i>life is but a dream
life is but a dream</i>

34:52.299 --> 34:54.509
you're way behind.
Sorry.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.143
Yeah. Now, I want you to sing it
again but this time split up. Okay?

34:58.221 --> 35:00.141
I want you to sing
every other word.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.773
Starting with you, Doug.
Ready? Wait for the "three."

35:02.851 --> 35:04.481
One, two, three...

35:04.686 --> 35:06.016
Row...
Row...

35:06.104 --> 35:07.404
Row...
Row...

35:07.480 --> 35:08.480
Your...
Row...

35:08.523 --> 35:10.733
Boat gently down...
Boat“

35:10.817 --> 35:12.607
gently down the stream.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.114
Work in progress.
Work in progress.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.945
You guys are gonna
figure that out later.

35:16.031 --> 35:19.121
When you do, really
listen to each other.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.660
Acting is listening.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.707
Anthony...
I project too much.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.002
I've been self-conscious of it
since I took this Meisner class.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.343
And is totally off because“.

35:29.419 --> 35:32.799
You just need to get out of your head.
Just be yourself up there.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.301
Acting isn't about method.

35:34.382 --> 35:37.552
It isn't about what your
idea of a good actor is.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.006
It's just about being yourself
through the character.

35:42.265 --> 35:45.055
That is literally one of the
greatest things I have ever heard.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.773
- Well, thank you.
- Hey.

35:47.562 --> 35:48.914
I'm glad you're
having fun out here

35:48.938 --> 35:50.668
but I've been looking for you
for the past 15 minutes.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.570
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
I was just...

35:52.651 --> 35:54.691
You're up. Now.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.326
So we should probably...
She's under a lot of stress.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.408
Yeah.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.002
We don't have the
budget to cover a staffer.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.871
It's 15 kids.
It's manageable.

36:07.957 --> 36:10.787
Okay, listen, I trust you
to own it right now

36:10.877 --> 36:12.377
because I can't
put my eyes on it

36:12.462 --> 36:15.672
for another four weeks until this
production is on its feet...

36:15.757 --> 36:16.967
You're gonna wanna see this.

36:18.885 --> 36:19.965
Looks really good.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.772
What is going on?

36:23.932 --> 36:25.432
Hey. So...

36:25.725 --> 36:28.685
The thing in the Bible where
Jesus flies up to heaven?

36:28.770 --> 36:30.730
The ascension.
Yeah, that.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.984
I think fading out
after the resurrection

36:33.066 --> 36:34.646
is just way too soft an ending.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.534
We need something
with more punch.

36:36.653 --> 36:40.033
I don't think this is a good idea.
Let me show you. Guys.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.789
This is pretty awesome, right?
Ls it safe?

36:50.625 --> 36:51.955
Oh, man!

36:53.837 --> 36:55.877
- Are you guys okay?
- Perfect.

36:55.964 --> 36:56.974
Bad idea.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.218
We are not doing this.
Gavin, go get looked at.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.051
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I just...

37:02.137 --> 37:03.557
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.678
Just got a few kinks.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.064
Doug, we can work
on that, right?

37:06.141 --> 37:08.561
No, no.
Get this rig out of here!

37:08.643 --> 37:10.443
We will pick up rehearsal
tomorrow, you guys.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.290
It was the gloves. We could
get different gloves.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.313
Yeah.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.605
Kelly, what's your problem?

37:17.861 --> 37:19.701
Besides that you almost died?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.569
You're making this impossible.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.196
I know you're talented
and charming,

37:24.284 --> 37:27.914
but I've had entire classes of fourth
graders who are less trouble than you.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.656
And what you still don't get

37:29.748 --> 37:33.078
is this is entirely
opposite of who Jesus was.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.458
He wasn't about spectacle.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.804
He was humble.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.589
He made himself low.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.222
If you weren't so busy trying
to make everything sparkle

37:40.300 --> 37:42.890
and burn and fly,
maybe you'd see that.

37:43.678 --> 37:44.928
Just go home and rest.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.429
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:07.202 --> 38:10.292
Bulls still down?
By six.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.501
Ah...

38:14.709 --> 38:16.339
Mind if I sit down?

38:16.461 --> 38:18.051
Yeah, have at it.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.883
Thanks.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.807
Oh...

38:28.056 --> 38:30.726
Still cold.
No.Can't

38:31.726 --> 38:33.186
right.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.153
Chips.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.730
Are they organic?

38:41.069 --> 38:42.199
What?

38:46.324 --> 38:47.584
Nothing.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.207
D. Rose will get them back.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.053
He just needs to start
hitting his jumper.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.077
He's no MJ.

38:57.585 --> 38:58.795
Who is?

39:01.714 --> 39:03.094
Didn't know
you still watched them.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.586
Of course.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.349
Uh... it's why I was in
town this time, actually.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.600
Went to most of their games
the last few years.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.102
Sort of followed them around.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.774
It reminded me of home, I guess.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.599
Didn't know that
was a good thing.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.317
Wasn't all bad.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.493
So, how are things
in Jesus-ville?

39:25.697 --> 39:26.947
On...

39:27.031 --> 39:29.951
Rough night. Rough night.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.787
But they're actually
not that bad.

39:33.454 --> 39:36.294
I mean, different,

39:37.750 --> 39:39.290
but, yeah, not bad.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.883
It's nice to not be cliffy there.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.215
You're not cliffy here either.

39:52.473 --> 39:55.813
Has the greatest story ever
told become a one-woman show?

39:55.894 --> 39:59.404
I wish. Then maybe
we'd be on schedule.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.355
I really like what you've
done with the sets.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.613
Everything seems bigger.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.446
Everything's bigger actually.
Bigger sets, bigger problems.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.532
Bigger egos?

40:12.827 --> 40:16.657
You know, for being so smart,
he really is a whack-job.

40:16.789 --> 40:20.249
You'd think this was a rock
concert, not a church production.

40:20.335 --> 40:23.375
This was today's stunt.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.838
Gavin's idea for the ending.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.472
I don't think he gets the story.

40:29.552 --> 40:32.102
He's not unique. I'm still
figuring it out myself.

40:32.805 --> 40:36.055
Yeah, but I don't have time
to babysit him while he does.

40:36.142 --> 40:40.022
Then, don't. Don't treat him
like one of your students.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.984
Make him your partner.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.515
Then, he won't fight you
so much.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.360
He brings a lot to this
that we don't have.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.360
We should take advantage of it.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.703
Large cappuccino, right?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.038
Hey.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.126
Hey. Oh. You are early.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.962
We're not on for,
maybe, 10 minutes.

41:06.756 --> 41:10.126
Yeah. Just catching up.
Hi. Who's this?

41:10.218 --> 41:12.598
Uh, this is Rachel.
She's in my Sunday school.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.869
She's gonna be one of the kids
in the palm branch scene.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.889
Hi, Rachel. You're gonna
have fun out there?

41:16.975 --> 41:18.225
Um, she's hearing impaired.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.814
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.
That's okay.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.436
I'm Gavin.

41:24.524 --> 41:27.194
Are you going to
have fun out there?

41:30.238 --> 41:35.328
Oh... now, remember, don't hit
Jesus with the palm branch.

41:38.162 --> 41:42.042
Hey. I'm working on it.
Thank you.

41:42.208 --> 41:46.588
Rachel, go find
Ms. Charlotte, okay?

41:49.465 --> 41:51.585
I didn't know you could sign.

41:51.676 --> 41:55.926
Yeah, I learned it for a hallmark movie.
A little rusty.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.604
Oh, she doesn't normally
communicate that much.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.854
She should. She's funny.

42:01.769 --> 42:02.939
Yeah.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.441
Since you're here, I want to
talk to you about a few things.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.856
One, we're falling behind.

42:09.944 --> 42:12.104
Yes, I know. I know. I know
exactly how to fix it, too.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.485
Have you heard
of an Italian run?

42:13.573 --> 42:14.823
Gavin! Listen.

42:14.907 --> 42:17.287
Actors are supposed
to be listeners, right?

42:17.618 --> 42:19.118
Yes.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.213
Okay. One,
we're falling behind.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.706
Two, a lot of your ideas not
only don't work for the role

42:24.792 --> 42:26.592
but they're too
expensive anyway.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.049
Three, you're really annoying.

42:28.129 --> 42:30.209
So, let's just try this.

42:31.507 --> 42:34.137
If you work really hard

42:34.218 --> 42:37.348
on getting us caught up,
and more importantly,

42:37.430 --> 42:40.180
learn who you're playing,

42:40.266 --> 42:44.226
I will be more open to

42:45.438 --> 42:46.648
your input.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.523
Really?

42:49.192 --> 42:50.232
Yes.

42:50.318 --> 42:53.238
But you have to
lock in on this. Okay?

42:53.321 --> 42:54.951
If you can learn sign language,

42:55.031 --> 42:56.571
of all things,
for a hallmark movie,

42:56.657 --> 42:58.867
you can put half that kind
of time into this thing.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.661
Okay. Okay.

43:02.747 --> 43:03.957
You're right. Okay.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.339
Well, okay then.

43:08.169 --> 43:11.049
Good.
Good.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.930
Good.

43:39.909 --> 43:44.159
The more we give up control,
the more Jesus takes control.

43:48.376 --> 43:49.376
Row...
Your...

43:49.418 --> 43:50.418
Boat“ gently...

43:50.503 --> 43:51.503
Down...
The...

43:51.546 --> 43:52.706
Stream...
Merrily...

44:11.732 --> 44:16.402
So, Jesus said, "let the
little children come to me."

44:16.487 --> 44:18.107
Whoa. No!

44:20.408 --> 44:22.948
Guys, no. Stop.

44:28.124 --> 44:29.964
And that's a wrap
for set building.

44:44.265 --> 44:45.675
So... good night.
See you tomorrow.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.226
Yeah, I'll give you a ride.

44:47.768 --> 44:50.768
Come on.
Say something nice.

44:50.855 --> 44:54.185
It is coming together
nicely, thank you.

44:54.275 --> 44:56.985
See? There it is.
So let's celebrate.

44:57.069 --> 45:01.279
I haven't clogged an artery in a while.
Let's grab some deep dish.

45:01.449 --> 45:02.739
It's been a long week.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.695
It's not a date.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.995
It's merely a discussion
outside of the workplace

45:07.079 --> 45:09.433
that positively acknowledges the
work we've done to this point

45:09.457 --> 45:12.037
and seeks solutions on said success.

45:18.299 --> 45:20.679
At the end of the night,
he introduced me to his parents

45:20.760 --> 45:24.060
where his mom pulled me
aside and said, and I quote,

45:24.138 --> 45:27.268
"god told me you're gonna be my
daughter-in-law someday." Oh...

45:27.350 --> 45:28.430
First date.

45:28.517 --> 45:29.767
What did you say?

45:29.852 --> 45:33.402
I said, "um, I think you heard
wrong." And then I took off.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.571
No.
Yeah, <i>I</i> had to.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.404
All right, all right.

45:38.486 --> 45:41.356
So I gotta ask,
and this is not a line,

45:42.323 --> 45:43.913
why no boyfriend?

45:45.576 --> 45:48.286
Mmm... not for tonight.

45:48.371 --> 45:51.001
John mark says, and I quote,

45:52.083 --> 45:56.423
"you only have room in your life for
one man, and that is Jesus Christ."

45:57.838 --> 46:01.878
Well, that is a kind of line that
works on a guy like John mark.

46:02.343 --> 46:04.183
Mmm. So what is it?

46:05.721 --> 46:06.891
You first.

46:07.723 --> 46:09.103
Well, that's easy.

46:09.183 --> 46:11.853
I'm a petulant narcissist
with intimacy issues

46:11.936 --> 46:13.396
stemming from
a robbed childhood,

46:13.479 --> 46:16.899
where my every whim was met
with instant gratification.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.986
Back to you.

46:21.570 --> 46:23.070
I was engaged.

46:23.823 --> 46:25.493
What? When?

46:26.367 --> 46:28.327
Seven, eight years ago.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.791
Head of our music ministry.

46:30.871 --> 46:32.101
Couple of months
before the wedding,

46:32.123 --> 46:35.633
he came to me and he said he wanted
to take his music to Nashville.

46:35.710 --> 46:36.880
With his new girlfriend.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.086
Oh. Whoa.

46:39.588 --> 46:44.548
Yeah, so, did what any
normal girl would do.

46:45.553 --> 46:49.223
I flew to Nepal to work at our
church there for two years.

46:50.433 --> 46:53.353
And since then, I've just
been focused on my work here.

46:53.436 --> 46:56.556
Yeah, focused is
one word for it.

46:58.482 --> 47:00.902
I'm not that bad.
I can be breezy.

47:01.694 --> 47:03.574
Breezy?
Yeah.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.114
Prove it.

47:05.197 --> 47:07.407
Yeah, tell me a joke.
Right now.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.123
You can't just say
a joke out of nowhere.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.463
Yes, you can.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.418
I'm gonna show you.

47:17.376 --> 47:19.166
So, guy walks into
a doctor's office,

47:19.253 --> 47:20.673
he says, "doc,
you've gotta help me.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.415
"I have this horrible
Twitter addiction."

47:22.506 --> 47:25.216
Doctor says, "sorry,
I'm not following you."

47:27.011 --> 47:28.051
That's good.
See?

47:28.137 --> 47:29.257
Yeah.
All right, your turn.

47:31.557 --> 47:32.677
Okay.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.061
Okay. Ahem.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.228
How do you make a tissue dance?

47:40.358 --> 47:41.778
Put a little Boogey in it.

47:44.403 --> 47:45.403
That's a good joke!

47:45.821 --> 47:47.161
It's a joke.

47:47.365 --> 47:51.035
Okay, fine, I'm intense.

47:51.118 --> 47:53.448
But that's just because I
care about what I'm doing.

47:53.621 --> 47:56.251
You know, like, not to
get cheesy or anything,

47:56.332 --> 47:59.712
but we're doing this for the
lord, you know what I mean?

47:59.960 --> 48:01.880
Yeah. Sure.

48:04.298 --> 48:05.628
I'm sorry.

48:05.716 --> 48:09.596
You don't know what it's like,
living in a fishbowl like this.

48:09.678 --> 48:11.508
Pastor's daughter.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.849
Everybody's watching, waiting
for me to make a mistake.

48:14.934 --> 48:16.944
Oh, yeah, I have no
idea what that's like.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.689
Okay, fair enough.

48:19.855 --> 48:23.565
The difference is, people
expect you to be perfect.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.701
They expect me
to be the opposite.

48:26.779 --> 48:31.619
I'm not any fun if I'm not
acting crazy or drunk or saying,

48:31.700 --> 48:33.540
"don't look at me!"

48:34.703 --> 48:36.003
And yet, here you are.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.285
<i>At a church.</i>

48:38.374 --> 48:40.084
And yet, here I am.

48:41.043 --> 48:43.253
God works in mysterious ways.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.010
Am I right?
Ls that how it goes?

48:48.092 --> 48:49.592
Yes, well done.

48:50.428 --> 48:53.808
All right.
Gotta get you back.

48:54.890 --> 48:57.440
Come on, let's put a little
Boogey in it.

49:03.691 --> 49:06.031
Well, thank you for the ride.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.817
You're welcome.

49:08.362 --> 49:10.362
Good night.
Good night.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.373
Oh. Hey, um,

49:13.492 --> 49:15.372
about that mistake thing.

49:15.619 --> 49:18.259
You know, where you think everybody's
waiting for you to make them?

49:18.789 --> 49:20.369
If they are,
it's not to judge you.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.693
From what I've seen
of the people here,

49:22.710 --> 49:25.590
I think if you admitted
you made mistakes,

49:25.671 --> 49:27.721
they'd like you even more.

49:30.468 --> 49:31.758
I'm not sure that's true.

49:32.636 --> 49:35.966
You know, early on, I thought my
biggest mistake was casting you.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.056
No.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.638
No, no, no,
they're gonna love me.

49:40.728 --> 49:43.398
Okay, good night.

49:44.565 --> 49:45.855
All right, good night.

49:48.652 --> 49:49.742
Bye.

49:56.911 --> 49:58.041
You're out late.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.503
What you doing still up?

50:01.582 --> 50:05.792
Every night, almost midnight,
you're hammering and sawing

50:05.878 --> 50:07.508
and whatever that thing is.

50:07.588 --> 50:08.918
It's a level, Gavin.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.256
Yeah, leveling.

50:11.550 --> 50:12.550
Why?

50:13.928 --> 50:15.468
'Cause I said I would.

50:17.097 --> 50:19.927
Wanna know the last promise
I made to your mom?

50:20.643 --> 50:21.693
Right here.

50:22.186 --> 50:26.146
I told her I'd build her a dream
house with countertops and all.

50:28.484 --> 50:30.154
It's the first promise
I broke to her.

50:31.278 --> 50:32.448
Sorry.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.780
Yeah, me, too.

50:35.824 --> 50:39.914
You know, we could get mom
that dream house sooner.

50:39.995 --> 50:42.115
I could try and help out
with this stuff.

50:42.248 --> 50:44.628
Mmm. Well,
that would be a first.

50:44.708 --> 50:48.958
Apparently, this Jesus fellow
I'm playing is into carpentry,

50:49.088 --> 50:51.588
<i>so 'Nd be good character
research anyway.</i>

50:51.674 --> 50:52.724
Maybe.

50:54.843 --> 50:57.013
So, got a question.

50:58.472 --> 50:59.712
Was out with this girl tonight.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.810
No, that's outside my area.

51:01.892 --> 51:04.312
What do you mean?
You're my dad.

51:04.395 --> 51:06.555
Aren't you supposed
to tell me what to do?

51:06.647 --> 51:07.927
Gavin, you're a man in your 30s.

51:07.982 --> 51:09.132
I think you can figure it out.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.399
She's the pastor's daughter.

51:10.609 --> 51:11.609
Oh.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.236
You didn't...

51:13.988 --> 51:15.358
No, no, no.

51:15.656 --> 51:17.026
I just connected with her.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.616
Like a normal person.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.167
And she doesn't care about
the celebrity thing.

51:22.871 --> 51:24.791
That's new for me, too.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.591
Okay, so?

51:29.461 --> 51:30.551
So...

51:32.298 --> 51:35.338
So nothing, dad. I just
thought we could talk.

51:36.468 --> 51:39.178
Gavin, I'm old. I don't
know how to do this.

51:39.263 --> 51:40.723
Give advice.

51:40.806 --> 51:44.096
I got nothing but this big,
old empty mess of a house

51:44.184 --> 51:45.624
that I'm probably
never gonna finish.

51:49.523 --> 51:50.983
It is a mess.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.235
But it's not empty.

52:02.453 --> 52:05.833
You're listening to WAAY,
the best in Christian radio.

52:05.914 --> 52:08.044
This is the morning sun
with Wayne McCusker.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.853
So, hey, we have a special
guest with us this morning.

52:09.877 --> 52:11.707
But I don't need
to tell you who it is,

52:11.795 --> 52:15.165
you should be able to figure
it out when he says this...

52:16.508 --> 52:18.588
Don't look at me.
There it is.

52:18.677 --> 52:21.031
And of course, you can't look at
him 'cause he's on the radio.

52:21.055 --> 52:22.335
But if you're over 30 years old,

52:22.389 --> 52:25.559
you know that sentence comes from
former child star, Gavin stone,

52:25.643 --> 52:26.833
who's here with us this morning.

52:26.852 --> 52:29.362
Hey, Gavin. Or shall I call you cliffy?

52:29.605 --> 52:31.105
Uh, no, Gavin's fine.

52:31.190 --> 52:33.980
So, cliffy, you used to play in a
lot of roles on TV and movies,

52:34.068 --> 52:37.318
but you're here today to talk
to us about a special new role.

52:37.404 --> 52:40.244
One that might just be the most
special role of your life.

52:40.324 --> 52:41.494
Am I right?
Um...

52:41.575 --> 52:42.785
Tell us about it.
Okay.

52:42.868 --> 52:44.868
Well, it's called
crown of thorns.

52:44.953 --> 52:47.083
We're doing it at
the Masonville Bible church.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.674
It is directed by the fabulous Ms.
Kelly Richardson.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.394
And, Kelly, you snagged
cliffy for the part of...

52:51.418 --> 52:52.748
Jesus, yes.

52:53.253 --> 52:54.253
He's doing a great job.

52:54.546 --> 52:56.006
So, cliffy, let's talk.

52:56.507 --> 52:57.967
Aren't we...

52:58.050 --> 53:00.140
I'd love to hear about
your heart transformation.

53:00.219 --> 53:03.429
How has the blood of Christ
impacted your own walk?

53:04.139 --> 53:05.950
I'm sorry, what? Share with
us the spiritual journey

53:05.974 --> 53:06.984
that got you here.

53:07.059 --> 53:08.389
From sinner to savior.

53:08.477 --> 53:10.187
My spiritual journey?

53:10.479 --> 53:12.859
Well, I'd love to
tell you all about it,

53:12.940 --> 53:18.530
but, honestly, this production
isn't about Gavin stone.

53:18.612 --> 53:23.282
I'm really hoping and praying

53:23.701 --> 53:27.331
that when people come to see
this show, they don't see me.

53:28.288 --> 53:31.458
That I've gotten so lost in this
character, that they just see him

53:32.251 --> 53:34.591
and the story and
the rest of the cast.

53:34.670 --> 53:37.130
I don't want to be
a distraction to that.

53:37.589 --> 53:38.629
Wow.

53:41.593 --> 53:42.643
Teacher!

53:44.096 --> 53:47.466
This woman was
caught in adultery.

53:48.016 --> 53:51.266
You know the law, she must
be stoned for this sin.

53:51.353 --> 53:53.483
I'm writing?
Sorry, sorry.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.901
Uh, dumb question.
What is he writing?

53:55.983 --> 53:57.283
It doesn't say in the script.

53:57.359 --> 53:58.989
Because it's not in the Bible.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.949
Really? Why not?

54:01.029 --> 54:04.199
I guess 'cause it's not
the focus of the scene.

54:04.283 --> 54:05.993
But just improvise.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.076
Okay.
Okay?

54:07.161 --> 54:08.541
Keep going.

54:09.329 --> 54:11.919
This woman has sinned
against heaven.

54:11.999 --> 54:14.039
What shall be done with her?

54:14.668 --> 54:18.628
Let he who is without sin,
cast the first stone.

54:23.802 --> 54:28.062
My sister, where are
your accusers now?

54:28.140 --> 54:31.230
Does even one remain
to condemn you?

54:31.310 --> 54:32.690
None, lord.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.270
Neither do I.

54:35.439 --> 54:37.519
Go and sin no more.

54:38.650 --> 54:40.530
Yeah. Uh...

54:40.986 --> 54:41.986
This doesn't work.

54:42.112 --> 54:43.912
What's up? I thought it looked good.
Okay.

54:44.156 --> 54:45.866
You're doing great. Uh...

54:46.450 --> 54:49.330
First of all, why does
he even defend her?

54:49.411 --> 54:51.041
Does he know her?

54:51.580 --> 54:53.620
I've got this, Kelly.
Let me... yeah.

54:54.082 --> 54:56.172
It's called the
doctrine of atonement.

54:56.251 --> 54:59.211
What it means, is the
totality of human inequity

54:59.463 --> 55:03.933
can only be removed by the one who
establishes those moral parameters.

55:04.009 --> 55:06.299
However... uh, John
mark, not right now.

55:06.386 --> 55:08.056
But... we can talk
about it later.

55:08.388 --> 55:11.888
The whole thing
just feels so, um...

55:15.813 --> 55:17.403
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Where were we?

55:17.481 --> 55:18.651
Uh, it feels...

55:18.732 --> 55:23.072
Yeah, the whole thing just
feels so stiff and formal.

55:23.153 --> 55:26.163
I mean, it's not quite right yet, but
it will get there.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.870
Uh, Gavin, there's a Jack
Roth asking for you.

55:31.245 --> 55:34.285
I'm sorry, I need
to take this. Um...

55:34.373 --> 55:36.753
Yup, just tell him I'll
call him back on my cell.

55:37.209 --> 55:38.749
Sorry. Sorry.

55:38.961 --> 55:41.091
I guess we're taking a five.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.260
Hey, Jack, what in the world?

55:45.342 --> 55:46.982
This is important.
Why didn't you pick up?

55:47.094 --> 55:48.114
I'm in the middle of a scene.

55:48.136 --> 55:49.739
What are you talking about?
From the production.

55:49.763 --> 55:52.813
The church production
that I'm doing.

55:52.891 --> 55:53.952
I didn't tell you about this?

55:53.976 --> 55:55.411
No, I thought you were
doing maintenance.

55:55.435 --> 55:56.475
<i>I was.</i>

55:56.562 --> 55:59.192
But they cast me as Jesus in
their big Easter production.

55:59.273 --> 56:02.113
So now I get to act to work off my hours.
It worked out perfect.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.192
They cast you as who?

56:03.610 --> 56:04.610
Jesus.

56:07.322 --> 56:09.832
Yeah, look, what do
you want, Jack?

56:09.908 --> 56:12.738
Okay, this is
why I love you, kid.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.958
<i>Because I love you,
I took a chance with Meara.</i>

56:15.038 --> 56:16.078
So you got through to him?

56:16.123 --> 56:17.683
I remembered how much
he loved to party,

56:17.749 --> 56:19.229
so I told him
your little hotel story,

56:19.293 --> 56:20.653
but I spiced up your
role in the incident.

56:20.669 --> 56:22.399
<i>And said that you'd love
to catch up with him.</i>

56:22.421 --> 56:23.511
Yeah? And?

56:23.589 --> 56:25.669
And after he demanded
to see the pictures,

56:25.757 --> 56:28.757
he said that he'd keep an eye out
and that he would be in touch.

56:28.844 --> 56:30.224
That's great.

56:30.304 --> 56:32.594
If he gets in contact with you,
you better be all over it.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.929
You got that? I will,
I will, I promise.

56:35.017 --> 56:37.517
Okay, so, seriously, now
that you're a Christian,

56:37.603 --> 56:39.023
can you pray for me?

56:40.397 --> 56:41.727
Bye, Jack.

56:49.031 --> 56:52.451
My sister,
where are your accusers?

56:53.660 --> 56:55.040
Where are your accusers?

56:55.120 --> 56:56.160
Still not working for you?

56:57.789 --> 56:58.829
Hey.

56:59.291 --> 57:01.751
Thought you went home. No, I
was printing up the posters.

57:05.839 --> 57:07.719
Oh. Not bad.
"Not bad"?

57:07.799 --> 57:10.089
You, of all
people, should love it.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.257
I put you front and center.

57:12.804 --> 57:15.474
Gavin comes first.
What?

57:15.557 --> 57:17.847
Uh, that's Jack, my manager.

57:18.727 --> 57:22.267
"Kid, this is all you need
to know about show business.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.779
"Gavin comes first.

57:24.983 --> 57:27.533
"Everybody else, they just need
something from you.

57:27.611 --> 57:31.411
"You want to survive in this
business, you look out for you."

57:33.158 --> 57:34.448
Interesting advice.

57:34.534 --> 57:37.044
Yeah. I was eight.

57:38.038 --> 57:39.038
Wow.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.582
But it stuck.

57:40.999 --> 57:42.329
"Gavin comes first."

57:43.543 --> 57:46.673
Maybe that's why you have such a
hard time playing somebody humble.

57:47.422 --> 57:49.632
Yeah, maybe it is.

57:50.217 --> 57:51.467
Thank you, Dr. Phil.

57:52.260 --> 57:54.390
Wait, I have an idea.
What are you doing tomorrow?

57:54.471 --> 57:57.221
It's Saturday, so sleeping.

57:57.975 --> 58:01.135
Maybe I'll wake up early for lunch.
Not tomorrow.

58:01.228 --> 58:03.938
Meet Doug at the garage
by the parking lot at 9:00.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.362
A.M.?

58:05.524 --> 58:06.734
I did say it was Saturday.

58:06.817 --> 58:08.987
You said your character
wasn't coming easy, right?

58:09.069 --> 58:10.069
Maybe.

58:10.153 --> 58:12.243
Just show up. Trust me.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.159
Hello.
Hey, man.

58:19.246 --> 58:20.246
Hey.

58:20.288 --> 58:22.498
Kelly said you'd be coming by.
Yeah.

58:22.582 --> 58:24.132
Welcome to CFSM.

58:24.209 --> 58:26.089
Cars for single moms.

58:26.169 --> 58:28.879
Okay, so, what's happening?

58:29.256 --> 58:31.006
Well, first of all,
you're changing.

58:31.425 --> 58:34.755
I think I might actually
have something new for you.

58:35.178 --> 58:37.178
Here you go.
Put that on.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.639
Rusted catalytic converter,
detached from the exhaust system.

58:40.726 --> 58:43.346
The VCT solenoid valve
needs replacing,

58:43.437 --> 58:46.857
and there's a significant binding
in the brake pedal linkage.

58:47.399 --> 58:49.189
I have no idea
what those words mean.

58:49.276 --> 58:50.606
All right, first things first,

58:50.694 --> 58:53.664
you're gonna change the oil filter
while I work on the convertor.

58:53.739 --> 58:56.029
You've done that before, right?

59:09.212 --> 59:11.972
All right. Tightened all the way?
Yup.

59:12.049 --> 59:13.179
Okay.

59:14.509 --> 59:15.639
Done?

59:16.219 --> 59:17.219
Not quite.

59:28.523 --> 59:30.573
So, what do you think?

59:31.234 --> 59:32.884
Think I've got a truck
I can bring in next week.

59:32.903 --> 59:35.493
Watch this.
This is the best part.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.168
They always try
to pay something.

59:50.253 --> 59:53.173
No, no, this is on us.

59:54.841 --> 59:56.891
Why don't you go over there? No.

59:57.010 --> 59:59.890
Then she'd know who did it.
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:02.428
We don't want the credit.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.983
Hashtag, words I've never
said to my agent.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.062
Exactly.

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:14.858
Hey.
Hi.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.452
So, who was she?

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.319
That was Olivia.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:22.787
Uh, two kids. She almost lost her job
'cause she couldn't get to it.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:23.999
But thanks to you...

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.786
Oh! Come on,
thanks to Doug.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:29.382
You got a little smudge or
something on your outfit here.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:30.754
That's very funny.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:32.705
Thanks.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.297
I know I look ridiculous.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.388
It's not so bad.
This?

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.184
It works on you.
Really?

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:42.433
Yup.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:49.147
- You know what this means, don't you?
- Do tell.

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.307
You're a free man.
What?

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:52.918
I still have a couple
more hours, don't I?

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.361
No. After your car work,
Saturday, you're over 200.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:58.609
Oh, no, that doesn't count. I don't
even want the hours for that.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.027
Really? Thank you.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.163
Well, then, after
rehearsal, you'll be done.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.742
I'll turn this in today, anyway.

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:06.502
I gotta tell you, Gavin, you have
really livened this place up.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.020
You've been a great
addition to our church.

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:10.184
And you've made my daughter's
life a little easier, too.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.288
Thank you. Thank you
for the second chance.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.402
All right, now I'm gonna need you to
pray for a full house this weekend.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:16.512
Way ahead of you.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.180
So how's the Messiah doing?

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.965
Hey, guys. We're not on for
another 10 minutes, right?

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:26.736
I know, but we wanted...
We just decided...

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.244
We just thought...
Well, we got you something.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.058
Years ago, when we
dedicated this building,

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.685
pastor Allan did
something really cool.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:33.691
Gave each church member
a nail from the building.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:34.773
We all kept ours.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:38.278
We just thought since you're
a part of the family now,

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.532
that you should have them.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.664
Ah...

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.330
Do you like it?

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:52.672
Thank you, guys.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.961
I don't know what to say.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.340
All right, it's last
week of rehearsals.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:03.431
Let's crush this.

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:05.644
All right.
Gavin?

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:07.274
Oh, yeah.

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.015
Okay, exit Jesus.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.818
Houselights, please.
Houselights.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.110
You guys, that was great.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:24.781
Whoo!

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.330
It's really coming
together, you guys.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.120
We will pick up work tomorrow morning.
We'll go over tweaks then.

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.995
Just call it a night, okay?

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.415
Hey, um, I have
a few notes for you,

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.651
but l have some last minute costume
alterations I need to do.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.650
I was thinking maybe you could
meet me at my place in a bit.

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.592
I'll make you coffee.
You asking me on a date?

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.844
Whatever you need.
Just get there, okay?

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:49.773
All right, all right. Just like to
be courted a little bit. That's all.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.402
<i>Hello.
Gavin stone?</i>

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.823
Long time, no talk.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.363
Yeah, it has been.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.816
<i>So, I got some good news.
Like the sound of that.</i>

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.407
Long story, short.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.052
Your man, Jack,
told me about that rager

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:11.287
<i>you threw on the roof
not too long ago.</i>

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:15.041
Yeah. Yeah, man,
it was something.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.955
<i>Ah! What an animal!</i>

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.923
I got so inspired by the story,

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.304
that I scrapped
a character in my show,

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:22.531
<i>and I rewrote one just for you.</i>

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:23.549
What?
Yeah.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.593
<i>And I want you to come
out to la to play it.</i>

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:28.347
A series regular.
I need that bad boy energy.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:31.221
<i>Uh...
I got network approval.</i>

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.098
And the PR,
they love the whole thing

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:34.894
about the child actor
playing the druggie.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:37.898
<i>We shoot as soon as
you hit the set tomorrow.</i>

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.612
<i>It shoots tomorrow?
It is the real deal.</i>

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:46.025
<i>I'm in Chicago, man.
This is the big leagues, bro.</i>

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:48.834
You got a first class ticket waiting
for you right now at O'Hare.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:53.078
Well, you know this production I'm
doing, it runs through the weekend.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.003
Yeah, Jack mentioned
something about that.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:58.461
Yeah, it's a stage production
of the Bible, actually.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.085
TMZ's gonna eat that one up.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:03.468
<i>Well, whatever it is,
you got a back-up, right?</i>

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:04.761
Yeah.

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:07.046
Yeah, there's a guy, Charles.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.505
<i>Great, so you got it covered.</i>

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.505
This is not gonna
happen twice, all right?

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:13.177
<i>Not for you. So like I
said, I need to know.</i>

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.516
<i>Are you in?</i>

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.101
<i>Are you stupid?</i>

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:18.942
I'll see you in la tomorrow.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:09.449
Charlotte just called me.
Okay.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:11.871
She said she overheard you
on the phone with some la guy.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:15.250
She heard you agree to leave
tonight for some shoot.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:16.968
I told her that
she must have heard wrong.

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:20.538
That there's no way you're leaving
three days before opening night.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.125
That nobody,
not even Gavin stone,

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.001
would do something that selfish.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:26.671
Please tell me she's wrong.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.681
It shoots for three weeks
in la starting tomorrow.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.676
There's a plane waiting
for me right now.

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:35.682
I'm gonna be on it.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:39.393
This isn't happening.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:40.847
Look, I'm sorry.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.359
You're sorry?

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.671
Say it again, I'm sure
it'll make me feel better.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:45.691
Kelly...

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.695
Do you know that I have a
voicemail message from my dad

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:52.988
saying that every seat in the house
is reserved for opening night.

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:55.294
Charles will be happy
to step in.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.078
Everything we changed
still works.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:06:01.122
Your name and face are on the poster!
Are you out of your mind?

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.077
I can't say no to this.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.840
Hollywood isn't like church.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.800
Second chances
don't just come around.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.591
What am I supposed
to tell the cast?

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:15.715
I think that god has
something bigger for me.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:18.845
God has nothing to do with this.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.103
How do you know? Doesn't god
want me to pursue my dream?

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:23.477
To be happy?

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:25.483
I can't believe this.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:28.275
What kind of Christian
is this selfish?

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:31.199
I'm not a Christian! Okay?

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.370
Do you really not know that?

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:37.576
I do now.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.405
I didn't think
it would go this far.

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:42.582
I don't even know
how it happened.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.294
And I didn't know that you and I...
Don't.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:49.589
Don't.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.434
How can I make this up to you?

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:55.389
I will do anything.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.640
Really?

01:06:58.723 --> 01:06:59.813
Okay.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.310
Call them.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:04.773
Tell them you have
another commitment.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.025
I shouldn't be surprised.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.660
Gavin comes first, right?

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:15.198
Now, hold on. I told...

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:18.451
Gotta call the printers
and get new posters made.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.040
And you have
that plane to catch.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.131
Did I miss something?

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.218
My 200 hours are up.
I'm out of your hair.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:39.724
Tonight?
Yes.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:41.976
Got a TV gig that
shoots tomorrow. Just...

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.452
You know,
don't even worry about it.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.316
Isn't that church thing
happening this weekend?

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:46.983
Don't you start in with me, too.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:50.113
You're bailing on them.
Yes, dad, lam bailing.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.903
I'm a screw-up.
Go ahead, say it!

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:55.356
Look, if you don't
wanna stay here, fine.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:56.632
But don't walk out
on these people.

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:59.656
You were mocking them yourself.
Why do you care if I stay?

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.619
Because you said you would.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:05.999
That's great.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.882
So now you care about
my acting choices.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:09.749
It wasn't about acting.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:13.763
It was about keeping you
from becoming the kind of man

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.720
who thinks the world
revolves around him.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:21.723
I guess you failed.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:37.344
"Don't look
at me." There he is!

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.093
Hey!

01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:41.474
Hey, it is good to
see you again, stoney.

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:42.551
It is.
Yeah, man.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.073
Hey, need your autograph
before the end of the day.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.466
You know, to make
this all official.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:47.557
Um, hey, hon, honey.

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.912
Listen, could we make it a little
bit darker around the eyes there?

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:52.935
And that depression beard.
That is a keeper right there.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.232
I love it, I love it.
Good stuff. All right.

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:57.896
Hey, Mike, I wanna talk to you
a little about the character.

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:58.985
Got no time.
Come on, now.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.923
Look, you are gonna be fantastic.
Don't worry about a thing.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.549
All right, babe? I love you.
I'll see you soon.

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.783
I love you, too, Mike.
Yeah.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.463
Hey, Gavin,
let me get that for you.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.512
Gavin, my man, come on down.

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:24.603
Let's get this party started.
All right.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:28.684
How you feeling? You good?
Right here. All right.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:30.686
Sit down. Okay.

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:34.442
Stoney, you are
at your lowest point.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:37.231
You desperately need a fix.
All right? You with me?

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:38.567
Got it.
Listen,

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.238
I put a little
something-something

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:42.069
in your prop glass there,
all right?

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:45.155
An old favorite
of yours. Enjoy.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.241
Mike.
What?

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.785
I'm clean, man.
I can't...

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.539
Fine. Don't worry about it.
Enjoy the drink. Loosen you up.

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:52.871
It's for the character,
remember?

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.477
Come on. That's a
good baby, all right?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.590
All right-y!

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.980
Hey, let's crank one of these out, guys.
Let's go. Slate it.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.464
And roll sound.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:00.799
Marker.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:04.008
And action!

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:13.097
- Cut.
- That's a cut.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:16.766
Gavin, I said action.
Okay. Just hold on.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:17.856
Let's get into it.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.194
All right, now, let's roll.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.146
Back to one. Going again, take two.
Roll sound.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:24.447
Marker.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.374
And action.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:37.206
- Cut.
- That's a cut.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.901
What's the problem? All you
have to do is take a drink.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.175
Should be easy for you.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.385
That's the Gavin that I want.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.741
I don't know if that
Gavin exists anymore.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.224
He doesn't exist anymore?

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.863
That's the only reason
why you're even here.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:03.278
Then I don't belong here.
This was a mistake.

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:07.317
Oh, come on, now. Gotta get
back to Chicago. Sorry.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.620
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey,
you're kidding me, right?

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.750
Appreciate the opportunity,
Mike. Can't take it.

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:14.531
So, let me get this straight.

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:16.462
You're walking off
a network TV show

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.381
to do a church play
in flyover country

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:20.669
with a bunch of Jesus freaks?

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.460
Yes.

01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:23.798
I'll tell you what, buddy boy.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.335
You walk off this set,

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.594
you won't have one friend
left in this business.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.600
I never did, Mike.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:54.945
Be still.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:01.955
Okay.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:04.337
That's it for tonight, you guys.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:07.129
Um, we'll run it all the way
through tomorrow afternoon.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.586
- I don't know. What did you think?
- It wasn't that bad.

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.143
It's getting worse.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.523
It goes a little stage left.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.068
It's too far over.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:28.200
Jesus will bump into it during the
transition from the triumphal entry.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.161
Aren't you supposed to be in la?
Wasn't a good fit.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.620
Seems like the director
didn't like me very much.

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:39.746
Of course, I did walk off a set
in the middle of his shoot.

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:42.752
So, yeah...
Had his reasons.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.710
I know how he feels.

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:50.927
I don't have time, I have a show to prep.
Yes, I know, I know.

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.300
Can I just... please?

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.941
Nothing I can say
will make this right.

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.017
I don't have any lines.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.861
So, I'll just keep it simple.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:06.861
I was wrong.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:13.034
I was wrong when
I was rude and selfish.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.076
I was wrong when I lied.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:19.138
I mean, you guys
gave me an opportunity.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.746
I just blew it.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:27.000
And I know saying sorry
doesn't help, but...

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.631
Doesn't hurt.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.179
Lam.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:34.219
I am sorry.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.768
And I don't know
how this whole thing

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:41.728
you have with god works exactly,

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.361
but I like what
it does to you guys.

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:47.355
I'm saying, I don't
wanna lose this yet.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:53.573
I'll put in the maintenance hours
that I gave up to do this.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.236
I will work backstage
on the show.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:15:02.915
I will do whatever it takes
to earn this back again.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:05.995
Um...

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.383
I have to talk to the cast.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.472
I think they're listening.

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.182
What did he say?

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.314
Well, then,
I won't have to repeat it.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:22.389
I have to talk to
dad, too. So...

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.058
Understood.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:29.653
Okay. Good night.

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:48.293
Gavin.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:50.962
You're back in.

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.669
So I can...
I can help out?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.140
We want you to play Jesus.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:15:59.314
What?

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:04.854
Yeah, well, dad reminded me
of all that Christian stuff.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:06.435
You know,
what our church is about,

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.110
and how this could
really impact you.

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:10.519
And what grace looks like and...

01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:15.146
He did?

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.704
He did.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.660
And, um...

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:25.495
It took me a few minutes, but I
have decided to forgive you.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.924
What about the rest of the cast?

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:32.174
Took them a few seconds.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.048
So, um...

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:42.715
So I am back in, huh?

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:44.849
Just like that?

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:48.853
This is what we do.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.230
And we just pray for
the audience tonight,

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:37.611
that this story will impact them.
In Jesus' name.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.105
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:44.535
Told you. Full house.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.002
Yeah.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.588
Nice dress.

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:54.632
It's, um...

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.339
Breezy.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:01.427
Thanks.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:09.273
House lights off.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.022
Mary and Joseph on stage.

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:48.968
Behold, the lamb of god, who
takes away the sin of the world.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:09.656
<i>This is my beloved son
in whom I am well pleased.</i>

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.405
All right,
cue the miracle sequence.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:12.497
Disciples up. Now.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:17.876
Lord, wake up or we'll die.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.670
Help us, please!

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.798
Peace.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:26.052
Be still.

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:29.518
<i>Good teacher,</i>

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:32.942
what must I do to
inherit eternal life?

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:35.268
Go and sell all that you have.

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.984
I have many possessions.
Lam a wealthy man.

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:39.475
Give them away.

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:41.356
You'll have treasure in heaven.
I cannot

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:44.860
don't go.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:51.083
Don't walk away.

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:56.001
You'll miss out on so much.

01:19:57.167 --> 01:19:59.707
So much more than
anything you have.

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:12.465
Hosanna! Hosanna!

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.018
Hosanna!

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.313
Hosanna!

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:17.444
Hosanna!
Hosanna!

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:20.935
You know what the law says!

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:22.985
She must be stoned for this sin!

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:27.405
What is your answer, Jesus?

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:38.330
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.224
My sister.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:54.983
Where are your accusers?

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:12.788
My sister.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.710
Where are your accusers?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.670
Does even one remain
to condemn you?

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.092
No, lord.

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:28.835
Neither do I.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.970
Go and sin no more.

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:55.696
All right.

01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:00.334
I give in.

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:04.920
I surrender.

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.875
My way didn't work.

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:15.642
I missed out on all this.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:21.979
I missed out on you.

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:24.226
I'm sorry.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.191
I'm sorry for all of it.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.082
So, here goes...

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:40.865
Father...

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.540
Father!

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:48.585
Into your hands,

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.386
I commit my spirit.

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:18.373
The next three days were
dark ones for the disciples.

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:22.082
But as many of you know, that's
not the end of the story.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.254
We'll get back to
this in a second.

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:00.947
So, what happened out there?

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:04.785
I believe.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:43.177
So that was pretty cool.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:44.965
Yeah.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:48.228
That was pretty cool.

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:52.613
You connect with your dad?
Yeah.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:56.569
He said my room was
available indefinitely.

01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:01.870
And I met this girl that I like.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:05.583
Oh, really?

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.210
Oh, wow.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:11.003
She must be fabulous.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:12.960
Oh, she is.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.962
A little bossy.
I mean, to be honest.

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:18.876
But I'm thinking

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:22.175
I should spend some time
and get to know her.

01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:27.773
Especially now that
we go to the same church.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.266
Well...

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.265
Let me know how that goes.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.874
So what's next?
I smell a sequel.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.160
A sequel?
I don't think so.

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:50.544
Come on. There are so many
good stories in the Bible.

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:52.922
You got your David and Goliath.

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:54.166
Mmm-hmm.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:55.712
Matthew?

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:56.924
You know mark?

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.302
Luke.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:26:59.970
John.

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.050
Uh... oh, what about Moses?

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:04.505
We could build
a big boat in here.

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:07.966
Noah.
Noah! Him, too.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:10.385
Maybe I could direct that one.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:13.225
<i>Hey, you could use</i> your <i>row,
row, row your boat trick.</i>

01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:16.191
Yes! That's perfect.
