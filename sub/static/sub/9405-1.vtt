dead on this night. (LAUGHS)

Your shoes are filthy.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.870
Yeah, what trick is this, now?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.997
Don't you know what day it is?

02:19.097 --> 02:22.543
It's a day like any other, since I
tried to take your damn pot of gold.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.419
It's the 17th of March,

02:24.519 --> 02:27.363
the feast of St-Patrick.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.507
And your birthday.

02:28.607 --> 02:32.302
Ah! 'Tis a special
birthday for a leprechaun.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.429
I'm 1,000 years old.

02:34.529 --> 02:38.784
Tonight, I can claim my bride.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.732
Who'd marry a creature like you?

02:45.832 --> 02:48.527
Wait till you gaze
upon this lovely lass.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.655
Her lips so soft, her face so fair,

02:51.755 --> 02:53.824
her bosom so ample. (CHUCKLES)

02:53.924 --> 02:55.492
She's a fit match for me.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.869
And what evil trick will
you use to woo her?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.037
LEPRECHAUN: Tis simple.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.707
She sneezes once, she sneezes twice,

03:01.807 --> 03:05.127
she'll be my bride when
she sneezes thrice.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.920
Sneezes three times?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.172
Ah! And if no one saves her soul,

03:09.272 --> 03:13.427
by speaking "God bless you,"
the fair maiden is mine forever.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.096
And am I to be her slave as well?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.472
Oh, no.

03:17.572 --> 03:22.748
The moment the lassie's married to me,
then you, my slave, shall be set free.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.730
You'd like your freedom,
wouldn't you, William?

03:24.830 --> 03:27.941
You know nothing is more
precious to me than freedom.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.963
But why should I believe you?

03:30.627 --> 03:33.322
By the sacred vow of the wee people.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.550
When I am wed,
you'll have your freedom.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.553

03:56.653 --> 04:01.249
And I'd thrash any soul who
dared try and stop this union.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.234
Oh, please, master, no.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.402
What troubles you?

04:12.502 --> 04:14.905
Is she not beautiful enough for me?

04:15.005 --> 04:17.531
The girl, she's my daughter.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.386

are to be related.

04:36.693 --> 04:40.222
I'll find you a score of
lasses fairer than she.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.598
Oh, don't worry.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.543
I'll be gentle with her
on our wedding night.

04:46.953 --> 04:51.879
Now, just one more sneeze,
and you'll have your precious freedom.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.940
A curse be placed upon your
seed when you go dead.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.067
You may have saved your daughter,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.486
but on my next thousandth birthday

05:36.586 --> 05:41.575
I'll stalk your fairest offspring
and claim her as my bride. (LAUGHS)

You won't believe your eyes.

08:52.949 --> 08:57.020
It will be the most frightening
experience of your life.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.272
Is it really scary?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.858
Let me put it this way,
you're not pregnant are you?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.200
please stay away.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.285
This is not the tour for you.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.537
Let's go, this is one
of those rip-offs.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.332
Sure, walk away, I understand.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.543
If hearing the actual sound
of Jayne Mansfield's head

09:20.643 --> 09:22.963
being severed from her body
is too intense for you,

09:23.063 --> 09:26.112
well, then, you know,
more power to you.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.470
Maybe you should try Disneyland.
It's probably more your speed.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.055
Now, listen sport,
are you saying that...

09:32.155 --> 09:33.723
I'm not saying anything.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.017
This tour's too much for most people.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.227
Now, if you'll excuse me.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.953
You, sir.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.274
Are you interested in the
uncut, uncensored truth

09:43.374 --> 09:45.318
about Hollywood's dark side?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.988
Hey, honey, didn't we see this the
other night on A Current Event?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.197
No, sir, you did not.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.409
This is the stuff the TV networks
just don't have the guts to show.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.869
I wanna go and you're too scared.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.247
You can just meet
me back at the hotel.

09:57.347 --> 10:01.042
Step right in, madam, there's a
window seat reserved just for you.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.627
I am not scared.

10:02.727 --> 10:07.698
You can wait for her at this really cute
ice cream parlor right down the block.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.009

let me just get these last two
suckers and I'm all yours, okay?

10:23.998 --> 10:27.402
I understand. How can I compete with
Jayne Mansfield's severed head?

10:27.502 --> 10:29.128
- Well, you can't.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.907

opening isn't until December.

Looks like our lucky day, huh?

- And there you go, okay.
- Great.

back, there, yup, there you are.

I will now summon your
guide to the dark side.

steel going two hundred miles an hour.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.906
Cody, we're going to the go-kart
park, not the Indy 500.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.657
A boy can dream, can't he?

11:14.757 --> 11:17.744
I can't believe we're actually gonna
spend the afternoon together.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.788
Listen, this job's important.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.791
I gotta make enough money to
pay for my sister's eye operation.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.959
Good plan. If only you had a sister.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.128
Oh, you know me too well.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.963
- Let's go nab your uncle and split.
- Okay.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.780
Okay.

- Morty!

11:35.486 --> 11:37.847
Well, I'm glad to see you
guys got that cleaning lady.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.699
Hey, Morty!

11:41.284 --> 11:44.287
He's not under the shirts.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.626
I know where he is.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.777
You look like the kind of a man

11:50.877 --> 11:54.656
who can recognize a great
opportunity when he sees one.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.118
Now, by investing in a
Darkside Tour franchise,

11:58.218 --> 12:01.371
you can turn death into dollars.

12:01.471 --> 12:07.853
I can personally almost guarantee
you a 45% annual return.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.964
How about you guarantee
you pay for that last round?

12:11.064 --> 12:15.426
Frank, I am entertaining a client.

12:15.526 --> 12:19.430
Sir, by being a partial franchisee,

12:19.530 --> 12:24.185
you can own 5% for a mere $600.

12:24.285 --> 12:27.584
What do you say? Do we have a deal?

12:30.541 --> 12:33.339
Your family will thank you.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.171
(CHUCKLES)

12:40.969 --> 12:43.037
- What is it?
- Bad luck.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.165
Come on.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.251
Frank, you are a witness
to this transaction.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.086
Morty, let's go, we got a full
hearse waiting, come on.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.713
Well, let them wait.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.591
May we have another
round, please, to welcome

12:54.691 --> 12:58.970
the newest member
of the Darkside family.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.931
Bridget, it is always
a delight to see you.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.975
You know,

13:04.075 --> 13:07.478
you are never too young
to invest in your future.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.064
Morty, you've already given
me a dozen brochures.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.941
I'll let you know when my
father reads them, okay?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.194
She's a great kid, Cody.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.468
May I have another drink, sir?

13:24.387 --> 13:25.997
What the hell is that?

13:26.097 --> 13:27.665
Red special rye.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.168
Cola and water. You've had enough.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.463
How dare you!

13:33.563 --> 13:36.441
I am as dry as can be.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.700
Cody? The usual?

13:44.032 --> 13:45.225
Thank you.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.042
This'll just take a second.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.733
I'm sober.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.006
I'm sober!

13:56.753 --> 13:59.096
Wait. Wait.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.078
Okay. Give me your comb.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.164
I don't have one.
You look fine, come on.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.166
It's a great day today, Cody.

14:10.266 --> 14:14.545
I just sold another 5%
share in the franchise.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.465
Look, Morty, we got a full
hearse waiting for the tour,

14:17.565 --> 14:19.717
I even suckered two rubes
for the deluxe package.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.886
- Let's go.
- Just two?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.388
You're slipping, kid.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.182
I was in kind of a hurry. Bridget and I
have a date to meet up with some kids

14:26.282 --> 14:28.017
from school down at the go-kart park.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.085
Ah, l'amour!

14:30.203 --> 14:33.022
But one day you'll wake up.

14:33.122 --> 14:37.110
And you'll realize there is only
one thing a woman wants.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.905
She will grab your heart,
tear it outta your chest,

14:41.005 --> 14:43.324
and throw it on the floor.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.576
Not now, Morty, please,
they're waiting.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.495
Indeed they are.

14:47.595 --> 14:52.976
Now, where are my keys?
The dark side awaits us.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.880
Where'd they put the door?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.549
You can't give the tour.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.051
- Why not?
- Well, because you're plastered.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.262
So, what difference does that make?

15:04.362 --> 15:06.389
What is rule number one?

15:06.489 --> 15:08.725
I know, I know, never turn
away a paying customer.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.770
I may be a little loose,
but I am not so far gone

15:12.870 --> 15:17.841
that I will turn away
a packed hearse.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.237
On the other hand, there's
always rule number two.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.280
Which is?

15:22.380 --> 15:25.349
Never kill a paying customer.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.244
We may have to cancel the tour.

15:28.344 --> 15:32.248
Here, give them their money back.

15:32.348 --> 15:36.478
Morty, you really are plastered,
there's almost $300 here.

We're already a half an hour late.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.367
- Give me the keys.
- Where you going?

15:47.738 --> 15:51.309
Rule number three. There's no
such thing as a refund, remember?

15:51.409 --> 15:53.478
I'll give the stupid tour.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.706
That's my boy.

Bridget.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.442

Ah, yeah.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.139
BRIDGET: (LAUGHS) What is it?

16:06.299 --> 16:09.202
Well, we don't have to take
the bus to the go-kart park.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.954
Marty's gonna give us
a ride in the hearse.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.771
