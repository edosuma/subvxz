00:02.336 --> 00:05.999
S-Something's coming this way.
It couldn't be Piccolo, could it?

00:08.926 --> 00:12.669
I fought Piccolo five years ago
at the Tenkaichi Tournament...

00:19.311 --> 00:21.472
...and managed somehow to win.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.057
Did he train for these five years

00:26.151 --> 00:28.733
and then come back to defeat me?

00:32.156 --> 00:34.944
No, it's not him! Then who on earth is it?

00:35.035 --> 00:40.120
Just who is this man who
has appeared out of the blue?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.914
Dokkan Dokkan tsuite'ru

"The Enemy is Goku's Brother?!
The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors. ”

02:17.179 --> 02:20.922
A-A tail! This guy has a tail, too!

02:22.976 --> 02:26.719
It looks like you've finally realized who lam.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.475
Who you are?

02:30.108 --> 02:32.440
--What do you mean?!
--Here, come over here with us.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.359
Kakarrot...

02:34.446 --> 02:37.404
...have you even forgotten about that?

02:37.491 --> 02:41.734
My name ain't that
funny-sounding Kaka-whatever!

02:41.829 --> 02:43.194
I am Son Goku!

02:43.288 --> 02:45.700
How can this be?

02:51.088 --> 02:52.919
You stay over there!

02:53.006 --> 02:54.086
Hey!

02:54.174 --> 02:59.089
Have you ever taken any strong
shocks to the head in the past?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.589
What?

03:00.681 --> 03:05.345
Did you hit your head hard,
say, when you were a child?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.096
Answer my question!

03:07.187 --> 03:09.223
I did!

03:09.314 --> 03:13.478
I don't remember it, but I hit
my head when I was really little.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.685
Just as I suspected.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.020
Even so, what does it
have to do with anything?!

03:18.115 --> 03:20.902
Goku!

03:20.993 --> 03:26.488
Along time ago, your grandfather,
Son Gohan, said something to me.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.698
One day, in a deep valley,

03:28.792 --> 03:32.831
he discovered a strange object
that looked like it had fallen there.

03:32.921 --> 03:39.918
When he got closer, he saw a baby
with a tail, inside a round capsule.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.674
He decided to take him home and raise him,

03:42.764 --> 03:46.131
but he had a violent disposition,
and wouldn't take to him.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.263
He said he was at a complete
loss as to what to do with him.

03:51.565 --> 03:55.103
But one day, he accidentally fell into a ravine,

03:55.193 --> 03:57.650
hit his head hard, and nearly died,

03:57.738 --> 04:00.571
but he said the baby had
an unbelievable life force,

04:00.657 --> 04:02.943
and he ended up surviving.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.821
What's more, he said that after that,

04:04.912 --> 04:09.155
his violent nature disappeared,
and he became a good boy.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.955
A-And that was me?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.409
--Mm-hmm.
--W-What does that mean?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.836
Are Son-kun and that guy somehow connected?

04:19.176 --> 04:22.009
Just who the hell are you?!

04:22.095 --> 04:23.756
Tell me who you are!

04:25.641 --> 04:27.302
I will tell you.

04:27.392 --> 04:31.135
You are not from this planet.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.521
You were born on Planet Vegeta!

04:34.608 --> 04:36.018
You are a Saiyan,

04:36.109 --> 04:39.226
a proud member of the strongest
warriors in the universe!

04:39.321 --> 04:40.686
--The universe?!
--Warriors?!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.146
Saiyan?!

04:42.240 --> 04:46.950
And I am your older brother, Raditz!

04:48.497 --> 04:51.079
G-Goku's older brother?!

04:51.166 --> 04:54.579
You're brothers?! No way!

04:54.670 --> 04:56.080
Don't give me that malarkey!

04:56.171 --> 05:01.291
Y-Yeah! If Goku is an alien,
what's he doing on Earth?!

05:04.930 --> 05:10.345
The answer is simple. Kakarrot,
you were sent here to exterminate

05:10.435 --> 05:13.177
the humans who are cluttering up this planet.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.647
W-What did you say?!

05:14.731 --> 05:19.725
We Saiyans are a highly renowned warrior race.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.606
Our job is to travel around the universe,

05:21.697 --> 05:24.063
looking for planets that
have good environments,

05:24.157 --> 05:27.024
exterminating the people
already living on them,

05:27.119 --> 05:29.986
and then selling them to aliens
seeking a suitable planet

05:30.080 --> 05:32.617
for a high price.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.495
Adult warriors are sent to the worlds

05:35.585 --> 05:38.543
of those who have a high battle power,

05:38.630 --> 05:45.251
but for lower-level planets,
like this one, babies like you are sent.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.594
Kakarrot...

05:51.685 --> 05:54.552
Even by yourself, a few years
should have been plenty of time

05:54.646 --> 05:57.479
for you to have liquidated these pests.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.933
If you had only remembered
your mission, that is.

06:02.571 --> 06:07.065
Luckily, this world has a moon, as well.

06:07.159 --> 06:11.653
Hey, why is it lucky that there's a moon here?

06:11.747 --> 06:15.535
Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full

06:15.625 --> 06:19.368
that we Saiyans really start
hitting our stride, you know!

06:22.716 --> 06:25.458
What are you talking about?!
l have no idea what you mean!

06:25.552 --> 06:27.463
What?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.840
Y-You don't mean...

06:29.931 --> 06:32.013
Your tail!

06:33.685 --> 06:35.641
What happened to your tail?!

06:36.813 --> 06:39.270
It got cut off and disappeared a long time ago!

06:39.357 --> 06:44.317
H-How can that be?! You miserable fool!

06:45.405 --> 06:49.990
It's no wonder you get along so
well with the people of this world!

06:52.079 --> 06:53.660
Enough!

06:53.747 --> 06:56.955
Whether I'm from another planet,
named whatever,

06:57.042 --> 06:59.829
or you're really my brother, it doesn't matter!

06:59.920 --> 07:05.005
Anyone who would
exterminate all humans is the pits!

07:05.092 --> 07:09.552
lam Son Goku, and l was raised here!
Get out of here, right now!

07:09.638 --> 07:10.718
Yeah, yeah!

07:10.806 --> 07:13.673
You heard him! Whatever his past was,

07:13.767 --> 07:17.510
right now, Son Goku is a
better earthling than anyone!

07:17.604 --> 07:22.849
Goku has even saved the world! Beat it! Beat it!

07:26.363 --> 07:30.697
I'm afraid I can't do that, you see.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.993
The Saiyans weren't a race
of many people to begin with,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.492
but now Planet Vegeta has exploded,

07:37.582 --> 07:40.745
after a giant meteor collided with it.

07:45.507 --> 07:50.126
Most of the other Saiyans
were vaporized into space dust.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.212
Including our father and mother.

07:56.184 --> 08:00.803
There are now only four
Saiyans left, including you.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.512
Myself and one of the others survived

08:02.607 --> 08:04.814
because we were off attacking another planet.

08:04.901 --> 08:10.646
The other one got lucky because he
was sent to a planet, like you were.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.528
Just recently, we found a nice planet

08:14.619 --> 08:17.656
that we should be able
to sell for a very high price.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.658
We'd like to attack it,

08:19.749 --> 08:22.582
but it would be a bit of an uphill
battle with just the three of us.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.963
That's when I remembered about you, Kakarrot.

08:28.049 --> 08:31.041
Your battle power is still less than perfect,

08:31.136 --> 08:34.970
but if you joined the three of us,
we would be able to manage.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.429
--Stay back!
--Open your eyes, Kakarrot!

08:41.020 --> 08:42.932
It will be fun!

08:43.023 --> 08:44.604
|-|'m scared!

08:44.691 --> 08:46.773
Don't be ridiculous!

08:46.860 --> 08:50.227
I'd rather die than help you!

08:51.406 --> 08:53.397
| see.

08:55.994 --> 08:59.111
I've been wondering about something.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.948
That's your son behind you, isn't it?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.248
N-No!

09:03.335 --> 09:06.077
It's no use trying to pretend.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.082
What about the tail?

09:08.173 --> 09:11.290
That proves he has Saiyan blood, doesn't it?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.126
So what if he does?!

09:14.221 --> 09:18.339
Since you, the father,
aren't being very reasonable,

09:18.433 --> 09:21.550
what if I were to borrow
the son for a little while?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.315
Keep back!

09:32.989 --> 09:35.105
Just try to come any closer!

09:35.200 --> 09:36.906
I'll send you flying!

09:38.000 --> 09:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:50.882 --> 09:52.964
Father!

09:54.344 --> 09:56.300
--Father!
--Whoa, there!

09:57.847 --> 10:01.089
Kakarrot, l have your child.

10:01.184 --> 10:05.268
If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

10:05.355 --> 10:10.270
D-D-Damn it...!

10:10.360 --> 10:15.320
Kakarrot, I'm giving you
one day, so think about it.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.490
You don't have any choice
but to go along with us.

10:20.078 --> 10:24.117
However, you're going to
have to show me some proof.

10:26.167 --> 10:30.456
Oh, but it will be easy. By this time tomorrow,

10:30.547 --> 10:34.506
you will kill, let's say, a hundred
people from this planet,

10:34.592 --> 10:37.504
and pile up their bodies here!

10:43.685 --> 10:48.805
You heard me. I'll be looking
forward to tomorrow.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.729
He's my own brother's son.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.308
If at all possible,
I'd like to avoid killing him.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.110
I'm scared, Father!

11:01.953 --> 11:04.569
G-Gohan!

11:24.225 --> 11:28.093
Listen up. I'm going to say
this again, just to be sure.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.726
You will kill one hundred
people from this planet

11:31.816 --> 11:34.853
and pile their bodies up here, by tomorrow.

11:38.573 --> 11:42.566
Do that, and we'll let you join us.

11:42.660 --> 11:47.996
Of course, if there are no bodies,
it will mean the death of your son.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.246
Y-You coward! Using a child like that!

11:51.336 --> 11:52.792
Y-Yeah!

11:52.879 --> 11:53.868
Right!

11:53.963 --> 11:59.048
For one thing, there's no way
Goku could kill anyone!

11:59.135 --> 12:00.750
That's fine.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.961
As long as he doesn't mind if this one dies,

12:03.056 --> 12:07.891
there's no need for him to get
those hundred bodies ready.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.558
But...

12:09.646 --> 12:11.682
...either way, the people of this planet

12:11.773 --> 12:15.265
are destined to be wiped out before long.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.316
Once we subjugate this upcoming planet,

12:17.404 --> 12:21.363
we've decided that our
next target will be this world!

12:22.575 --> 12:24.611
W-What?!

12:26.162 --> 12:30.656
The three of us Saiyans
should be able to exterminate

12:30.750 --> 12:34.083
the people of this planet in just one month.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.832
Father!

12:40.927 --> 12:43.634
You got that, Kakarrot?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.336
No matter how you struggle,

12:45.432 --> 12:48.549
you have no choice but to
join your brother and his pals.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.806
G-Give me back the child!

12:53.648 --> 12:57.516
I'll be expecting a positive answer from you.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.727
For your sake, as well.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.023
Don't think you can go against me.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.449
With your work-in-progress battle power,

13:10.540 --> 13:14.749
there's no way you're a
match for your older brother!

13:14.836 --> 13:17.623
Father!

13:17.714 --> 13:22.879
Bye, now! I look forward to tomorrow!

13:22.969 --> 13:25.381
Gohan!

13:27.265 --> 13:30.177
Father!

13:30.268 --> 13:32.475
Gohan!

13:35.440 --> 13:37.146
Are you okay, Son-kun?

13:37.233 --> 13:41.977
S-Sorry, there was nothing
we could have done.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.448
Goku...

13:44.532 --> 13:46.944
Kinto Un!

13:49.037 --> 13:51.119
Hold on! That's crazy! Don't be hasty!

13:51.206 --> 13:53.538
Y-You can't! You'll be killed!

13:53.625 --> 13:57.584
Damn! What should I do?!

13:57.670 --> 13:59.956
Think.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.503
Steady, now.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.465
It's shocking, huh?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.841
You unexpectedly discover you have a relative,

14:09.933 --> 14:12.766
and it's that guy, of all people.

14:12.852 --> 14:17.516
Your brother's strength is monstrous, and all.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.223
His tail.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.899
If I...

14:21.986 --> 14:27.572
If I grab his tail hard,
his strength should slacken.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.991
l was the same way.

14:30.078 --> 14:34.538
B-But still, will you even
be able to grab his tail?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.740
You can't do it yourselves!

14:41.256 --> 14:43.121
Piccolo!

14:50.848 --> 14:55.433
You must know well enough that
his strength is out of your league.

14:55.520 --> 15:01.140
He isn't the sort of opponent that
you or I could take on directly.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.724
However...

15:02.819 --> 15:04.355
...if you and | team up,

15:04.445 --> 15:07.858
there is a slight chance
that we could defeat him.

15:07.949 --> 15:12.534
What on earth has gotten into you?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.906
Don't get me wrong.

15:14.998 --> 15:19.116
It's not like I've had my eyes
opened to peace, or anything.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.826
I don't care about your son, either.

15:24.215 --> 15:28.709
He just stands in the way of my
goal of world domination, that's all!

15:31.514 --> 15:33.129
|'|| team up with you,

15:33.224 --> 15:37.888
and once we've dealt with him
and those two buddies of his...

15:37.979 --> 15:40.186
...then of course, I plan to defeat you,

15:40.273 --> 15:45.313
and make the world mine this time for sure!

15:45.403 --> 15:47.519
I won't let you do that.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.696
I won't let you do that,

15:49.782 --> 15:53.866
but the part about the two of us
teaming up is a good idea.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.786
It looks like there ain't any
other way to do it, huh?

15:56.873 --> 16:00.786
That's right. We'll just have to put up with it.

16:06.299 --> 16:11.043
As far as I'm concerned, teaming up
with you makes me want to vomit.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.298
Bulma, let me borrow your Dragon Radar!

16:16.392 --> 16:18.303
R-Right!

16:20.772 --> 16:24.139
Can you keep up with Kinto Un's speed?!

16:24.233 --> 16:25.359
Don't be absurd!

16:25.443 --> 16:27.229
My own technique is a little different

16:27.320 --> 16:31.029
than your pathetic Bukujutsu technique.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.951
Let me out!

16:45.046 --> 16:48.834
Let me out! Let me out!

16:48.925 --> 16:50.961
Now then...

16:52.970 --> 16:56.383
That's strange. A warning signal.

16:58.017 --> 17:02.351
Battle power 710? It's close!

17:06.108 --> 17:07.645
What?!

17:14.659 --> 17:17.776
Damn, it's malfunctioning, huh?

17:17.869 --> 17:19.952
Don't startle me like that.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.536
We should descend now, and move in on him.

17:24.627 --> 17:28.415
It won't work! We should keep going like this!

17:28.506 --> 17:31.248
He uses a device.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.833
It seems to be able to clearly
tell him his target's position,

17:33.928 --> 17:36.340
and even their strength.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.888
You mean, the fact that
we're closing in on him, too...?

17:38.975 --> 17:41.637
I'm sure he's aware of it.

17:41.728 --> 17:47.064
You don't say. That means that all
we can do is attack him head-on!

17:48.943 --> 17:50.854
Again?

17:54.991 --> 18:01.408
Battle power 710. Tch,
it's a malfunction, all right.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.749
Two readings?

18:03.833 --> 18:05.664
They're headed this way!

18:07.336 --> 18:09.622
One... two...

18:09.714 --> 18:13.957
Battle power 322 and 334.

18:14.051 --> 18:18.340
One of them is the same
power that Kakarrot has!

18:18.431 --> 18:21.798
But there's no way he'd be coming.

18:21.893 --> 18:26.262
He has to know that there's
next to zero chance of him winning.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.973
And he wouldn't know
where I am in the first place.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.278
I give up. This thing is completely busted.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.031
It can't be!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.824
They're here!

19:05.269 --> 19:07.385
How did you know where l was?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.187
As if I'd tell you!

19:10.274 --> 19:15.189
Very well, I'll ask you a different question.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.442
What are you two doing here?

19:18.533 --> 19:23.118
Isn't that obvious?
We came to get my boy back!

19:23.204 --> 19:26.992
Which means that even though you're a Saiyan,

19:27.083 --> 19:30.701
you're refusing to join us, is that it?

19:30.795 --> 19:32.751
That's what I told you!

19:32.839 --> 19:36.172
You intend to defy your brother?

19:36.259 --> 19:39.046
I ain't got any brothers!

19:41.305 --> 19:43.921
Kakarrot...

19:44.016 --> 19:48.305
I thought you were a bit sharper than this.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.768
That's enough yammering out of you.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.727
His battle power just went up to 408.

19:57.822 --> 20:01.406
Is that right? You've been
training like crazy, too?

20:04.787 --> 20:08.575
This should make the fight go a little better.

20:08.666 --> 20:12.158
Kakarrot is now 416!

20:16.549 --> 20:19.336
You guys think you're stronger now?!

20:19.427 --> 20:21.258
What?!

20:21.345 --> 20:23.210
You make me laugh!

20:23.306 --> 20:26.343
To think that you would just
waltz on in here at that level!

20:26.434 --> 20:29.176
This is what it means to not know your place!

20:29.270 --> 20:34.981
Winning a fight ain't just
about who's the strongest!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.729
We've got ourselves a strategy!

20:37.820 --> 20:41.654
You think you're clever, do you?

20:41.741 --> 20:47.532
Kakarrot, I've decided to
give up on letting you join us.

20:47.622 --> 20:51.831
After all, it looks like
you'd just slow us down.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.957
You're a disgrace to the family! Die!

21:04.639 --> 21:09.383
I think I'll let you in on a little
something before you die.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.854
The two other remaining Saiyans

21:15.942 --> 21:19.434
have an even higher battle power than I do!

21:22.281 --> 21:24.522
Unprecedented terror!

21:24.617 --> 21:26.573
Does this mean that even if they defeat Raditz,

21:26.661 --> 21:29.869
there are even stronger warriors?

21:29.956 --> 21:34.575
Is there nothing that Goku and Piccolo can do?

21:36.837 --> 21:39.749
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:39.840 --> 21:44.334
Tobu n da mugen no sora e

21:44.428 --> 21:47.261
Jetto kiryuu ni nokkari

21:47.348 --> 21:50.385
doko demo iku yo sokkou

21:50.476 --> 21:52.717
Mukoumizu tte saikou

21:52.812 --> 21:56.145
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:56.232 --> 22:02.023
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

22:02.113 --> 22:08.200
kakegaenai kono hoshi yuzurenai kara

22:09.578 --> 22:12.536
Hajiketobase kamehameha

22:12.623 --> 22:15.786
Yabame no kono jidai

22:15.876 --> 22:21.496
sekai wo mamoru tame umareta kara

22:21.590 --> 22:24.502
Yaburekabure omoikiri

22:24.593 --> 22:27.721
Yaru n da furupawaa

22:27.805 --> 22:31.764
Kibou ga ore no buki dakara

22:31.851 --> 22:35.093
mirai shinjite

22:41.235 --> 22:44.978
Damn, that Raditz guy is so strong!
He's too much for me!

22:45.072 --> 22:49.156
Son Goku, let me show you
my new ace-in-the-hole move.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.905
If this doesn't work, nothing else
we can do will defeat him.

22:51.996 --> 22:55.488
All right, it's all or nothing!
Let's try and stop him!

22:55.583 --> 22:57.619
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.710 --> 23:01.874
"A Life-or-Death Battle! Goku and
Piccolo 's Ferocious Suicide Attack. "

23:01.964 --> 23:04.580
Stop picking on my father!
