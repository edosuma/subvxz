02:38.534 --> 02:40.035
Watson.

02:40.160 --> 02:40.911
Yes.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.205
Watch.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.420
The chemical reaction
you are about to witness

02:50.546 --> 02:55.175
will solve the mystery
concerning the persecution

02:55.259 --> 02:57.469
of Mr. John Vincent Harden.

02:57.553 --> 02:58.887
Excellent,

02:58.971 --> 03:00.889
the tobacco millionaire,
shall I take notes?

03:00.973 --> 03:04.518
No, I will dictate
in the fullness of time.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.734
There's a young lady wishes
to see you, Mr. Holmes.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.821
This is not
a convenient moment!

03:15.904 --> 03:18.574
She's very well spoken,
a genuine lady.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.534
No doubt.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.912
And persistent, too.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.498
Mrs. Hudson, I, too,
am extremely persistent,

03:26.582 --> 03:28.208
especially when I'm working.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.420
It is a matter
of great urgency, Mr. Holmes,

03:31.545 --> 03:35.048
or I would not be troubling you
on a Saturday evening.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.722
Perhaps you could, uh, delay
your chemical reaction, Holmes.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.765
Very well.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.190
Do sit down, Miss, uh?

03:51.273 --> 03:52.649
Violet Smith.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.985
Dr. Watson.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.530
Thank you Mrs. Hudson.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.950
A genuine lady,
I told you.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.537
Oh, please.

04:05.621 --> 04:09.958
Um, thank you,
I'll be quite happy here.

04:11.168 --> 04:15.047
Very well, Miss Smith,

04:15.130 --> 04:17.716
you must tell us
your matter of great urgency.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.635
It is obviously
not your health.

04:19.718 --> 04:23.096
So ardent a bicyclist
must be full of energy.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.973
Yes, I bicycle a good deal.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.935
Slight roughening on
the side of the soles

04:28.018 --> 04:30.479
caused by the friction
of the pedals.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.606
Excellent, Watson.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.025
The marks on your shoes.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.277
Oh, yes!

04:37.402 --> 04:38.987
Even if I have
to travel a long way,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.740
I take my bicycle on the train
with me as I did today.

04:41.823 --> 04:45.369
You will excuse me,
but it is my business.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.704
Yes, I nearly
fell into the error

04:47.829 --> 04:50.374
of supposing you earned
a living by typewriting,

04:50.499 --> 04:52.459
but of course,
it is obviously music.

04:52.543 --> 04:56.713
You will observe, Watson,
the spatulate finger ends,

04:56.839 --> 05:00.425
which is common
to both professions.

05:00.509 --> 05:04.346
There is a spirituality
about the face, however,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.431
which the typewriter
does not generate.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.976
This lady is a musician.

05:09.059 --> 05:12.312
Why, yes, Mr. Holmes,
I teach music!

05:12.396 --> 05:15.607
In the country, I presume,
from your complexion.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.111
Near Farnham
on the borders of Surrey!

05:21.530 --> 05:26.493
But please, let me explain
why I am here.

05:30.706 --> 05:35.502
I am an only child, and
my father died some years ago.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.754
His name and profession?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.047
James Smith,

05:39.173 --> 05:42.301
he conducted the orchestra
at the old lmperial Theater.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.846
Ah, the old lmperial, Holmes.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.389
Yes.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.808
Please continue.

05:51.894 --> 05:56.398
My mother and I were left
without a relation in the world

05:56.523 --> 05:59.151
except for one uncle,
Ralph Smith,

05:59.234 --> 06:02.571
who went to Africa
15 years ago,

06:02.654 --> 06:04.573
and we have not had a word
from him since,

06:04.698 --> 06:07.993
despite our Christmas cards
and photographs.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.956
Mr. Holmes,
I have to tell you that--

06:13.081 --> 06:15.667
I think you wish to tell me

06:15.751 --> 06:18.545
that you and your mother
are very poor,

06:18.629 --> 06:22.591
not withstanding your obvious
grace, dignity and talent.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.593
We were very poor.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.719
Ah.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.435
About four months ago,
in February,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.687
we were told there was
an advertisement in the Times,

06:35.771 --> 06:37.856
inquiring for
our whereabouts.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.025
You can imagine
how excited we were,

06:40.108 --> 06:42.819
for we thought that someone
had left us a fortune.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.613
I went at once
to the lawyers

06:44.738 --> 06:47.074
whose name was given
in the paper.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.413
Now, this is
Miss Violet Smith.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.000
The solicitor
introduced me to two men,

06:57.125 --> 07:00.420
a Mr. Carruthers
and a Mr. Woodley.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.674
They were on a visit
from South Africa.

07:13.559 --> 07:17.145
I wish I could tell you your
uncle left you a vast fortune,

07:17.271 --> 07:18.188
but as I said...

07:18.313 --> 07:21.483
He died in extreme poverty.

07:21.608 --> 07:26.864
However, I myself
am not without means.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.120
My mother and I
never sought charity.

07:33.245 --> 07:37.374
No, nor do I offer it.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.628
Please.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.009
I have a question
to ask of you.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.053
Your Uncle Ralph
said you were very musical,

07:50.179 --> 07:52.222
do you teach music?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.849
Yes.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.686
Miss Smith, I am now a widower
with a 10-year-old daughter.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.771
Young Sarah.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.277
She needs a music teacher.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.654
So, you see,
I do not offer charity.

08:07.738 --> 08:11.450
A job, he wants
to give you a job!

08:13.702 --> 08:18.290
Whereabouts in London
do you live, Mr. Carruthers?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.501
I don't.

08:20.626 --> 08:24.922
I live about six miles
from Farnham, in Surrey,

08:25.047 --> 08:27.049
at Chiltern Grange.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.635
I couldn't possibly leave
my mother on her own.

08:29.718 --> 08:33.597
I will pay you
100 pounds a year.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.726
A hundred a year?

08:37.851 --> 08:38.936
Yes.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.438
Approximately double
the market price, I think.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.190
Oh, at least!

08:43.315 --> 08:48.362
Which you obviously accepted,
or you wouldn't be here now.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.446
Yes.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.406
I accepted the offer.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.866
Mr. Carruthers agreed

08:52.950 --> 08:55.911
that I should go home every
weekend to my mother in town.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.330
So this is one of your
weekend visits to London?

08:58.413 --> 09:01.124
It is.

09:01.250 --> 09:04.378
Tell me about your life
at Chiltern Grange.

09:06.588 --> 09:10.843
For a while,
it was quite perfect.

09:10.926 --> 09:15.180
Every Monday morning I would
take the train to Farnham

09:15.264 --> 09:19.226
and then bicycle from
the station to the house.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.085
The little girl's
name was Sarah,

09:45.169 --> 09:47.087
and she was delightful,

09:47.171 --> 09:51.508
as well as being
a very good pupil.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.804
That was very much
better, Sarah.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.598
May I try it again?

09:57.723 --> 10:00.976
Of course,
that's why we're here.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.733
Mr. Carruthers was
appreciative of my work,

10:07.816 --> 10:11.737
and an extremely kind
and considerate host.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.449
Sounds idyllic.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.950
It was.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.872
What happened to spoil it?

10:21.997 --> 10:23.665
A visitor.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.792
Mr. Woodley.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.462
However did you guess,
Mr. Holmes?

10:28.587 --> 10:33.467
Miss Smith,
I never guess.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.804
Tell me about his visit.

10:38.514 --> 10:42.017
He arrived
and was to stay for a week.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.523
But to me it seemed
like three months.

10:47.648 --> 10:52.694
Oh, that odious
red mustache!

11:00.577 --> 11:02.871
One evening after dinner,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.123
Mr. Carruthers had
to leave us for a minute

11:05.207 --> 11:07.918
to see somebody
at the door.

11:08.043 --> 11:11.046
A gentleman
to see you, sir.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.765
Will you excuse me?

11:59.469 --> 12:03.223
That's better.

12:03.307 --> 12:06.435
Better, in what way?

12:06.560 --> 12:12.774
It's better to
get the old folk out of the way.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.152
I don't regard
Mr. Carruthers as old.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.447
Oh, yes,
but he isn't young...

12:18.572 --> 12:20.240
like us.

12:20.365 --> 12:24.036
I do wish you wouldn't blow
smoke in my face, Mr. Woodley.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.956
Oh, I don't believe that
for a moment.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.750
What don't you believe?

12:29.833 --> 12:32.753
When women say they wish
you wouldn't do something,

12:32.836 --> 12:35.172
it generally means
the exact opposite.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.925
I mean precisely
what I say!

12:38.050 --> 12:40.761
Mr. Woodley, will you please
leave me alone!

12:40.844 --> 12:42.054
No.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.640
To tell you the truth,
I won't leave you alone,

12:44.723 --> 12:48.435
not until I've said
what's in my heart.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.853
Whatever do you mean?

12:49.978 --> 12:51.855
I'm not very
well up on the social graces,

12:51.980 --> 12:57.819
but I'm prepared to learn,
if you're prepared to teach me.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.822
Oh, this is absurd!

13:00.906 --> 13:04.451
It isn't absurd!
I'm asking you to marry me!

13:04.576 --> 13:08.330
I mean it,
it's from the heart.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.790
Money isn't a problem,

13:09.873 --> 13:12.626
I did very well
out in South Africa.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.295
Whatever you are accustomed to,
I can give you better,

13:15.379 --> 13:17.214
better that
you're accustomed to;

13:17.339 --> 13:19.758
jewelry, diamonds.

13:19.842 --> 13:24.555
You want diamonds,
oh, I can give you diamonds.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.766
I don't want diamonds!

13:28.809 --> 13:31.186
Oh, you think about it.
I won't rush you.

13:31.270 --> 13:34.857
I've thought about it,

13:34.982 --> 13:38.193
and the idea is ludicrous.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.572
Well, you can't
blame me for trying!

13:41.697 --> 13:44.324
You're very beautiful.

13:44.408 --> 13:48.662
Listen, just to show
there are no hard feelings,

13:48.745 --> 13:51.206
what about a little kiss
to be going on with, hmm,

13:51.331 --> 13:52.708
just a peck on the cheek.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.376
Mr. Woodley,
will you please stop it!

13:54.501 --> 13:56.545
Oh, I told you before about
women who say stop it.

13:56.670 --> 13:57.254
No!

13:57.379 --> 13:59.506
The more they struggle,
the more fun it is.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.301
Mr. Carruthers,
will you stop him!

14:11.268 --> 14:13.103
Get out of this house!

14:13.228 --> 14:14.771
All right!

14:14.897 --> 14:16.732
I'm going.

14:16.857 --> 14:20.527
I'm not interested
in old men,

14:20.611 --> 14:24.114
and old maids!

14:30.078 --> 14:30.704
I can only offer you

14:30.787 --> 14:35.626
my most sincere apologies
for what has happened.

14:47.346 --> 14:51.558
If I give you my assurance
that it will not happen again,

14:51.642 --> 14:59.942
for my daughter's sake,
will you stay?

15:00.025 --> 15:04.571
Yes, I will stay.

15:04.655 --> 15:08.242
Thank you, Violet.

15:20.087 --> 15:24.424
Mr. Woodley left the house
and I have not seen him since.

15:24.508 --> 15:27.344
The blackguard!

15:31.473 --> 15:33.058
Has there been any change

15:33.141 --> 15:37.020
in the behavior
of Mr. Carruthers?

15:37.145 --> 15:44.611
No, he continues to be polite
and considerate and courteous.

15:44.695 --> 15:47.781
Now, Miss Smith, please,
please continue.

15:47.906 --> 15:52.786
Yes, there is something else.

15:52.870 --> 15:57.207
Oh, it may be
a mere fancy of mine,

15:57.332 --> 16:01.170
but it seems to me
that Mr. Carruthers

16:01.295 --> 16:03.297
shows a great deal
of interest in me.

16:03.422 --> 16:08.468
Oh, he has never said anything,
he is a perfect gentleman,

16:08.552 --> 16:12.764
but, a girl
always knows.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.309
So I believe.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.059
And I assume

16:16.185 --> 16:18.604
that these feelings that
you sense from Mr. Carruthers

16:18.687 --> 16:21.273
are not reciprocated?

16:21.356 --> 16:26.236
He is a kind and generous
employer,

16:26.361 --> 16:28.363
but I am already engaged.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.492
Oh, the name of this
very fortunate young man is?!

16:32.576 --> 16:34.953
Cyril Morton.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.747
He's an electrical engineer

16:36.872 --> 16:41.752
with the Midland Electric
Company in Coventry.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.838
We're to be married
at the end of the summer.

16:44.922 --> 16:48.133
We wish you joy.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.885
Thank you.

16:50.010 --> 16:53.305
Yet, I am puzzled as to why
you have chosen to consult me.

16:53.388 --> 16:56.058
It is an intriguing story,
to be sure,

16:56.183 --> 17:01.188
but I sense you are frightened,
and do not understand why.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.107
You seem well capable
of protecting yourself.

17:04.816 --> 17:11.240
Please,
help me, Mr. Holmes!

17:13.242 --> 17:16.619
What is it?

17:16.744 --> 17:20.582
I am being followed.

17:23.085 --> 17:27.589
Followed, by whom?

17:27.714 --> 17:31.552
A cyclist.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.470
Every Saturday morning

17:33.595 --> 17:36.348
I bicycle from the house
to Farnham Station

17:36.431 --> 17:39.518
to catch
the 12:22 to town.

17:39.601 --> 17:43.897
There is one very quiet
and lonely stretch of road

17:44.022 --> 17:47.150
that lies between Charlington
Heath on the one hand

17:47.276 --> 17:50.153
and the woods of
Charlington Hall on the other.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.574
Two weeks ago today,
I was passing this place

17:53.657 --> 17:58.787
when I chanced to look back
and saw a man,

17:58.912 --> 18:04.251
also on a bicycle.

18:04.334 --> 18:08.380
The following Monday when
I returned he was there again.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.007
I see.

18:10.132 --> 18:14.219
And again last Saturday,
and again last Monday.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.597
Have you mentioned this
to your employer?

18:16.722 --> 18:18.015
Yes.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.392
Mr. Carruthers
was very concerned,

18:20.475 --> 18:22.060
and has ordered
a horse and trap

18:22.144 --> 18:26.106
so that in the future I should
not travel unaccompanied.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.150
But they've
not yet arrived.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.445
And this morning?

18:31.528 --> 18:33.572
He was following me again.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.957
I slowed down,
but he did the same.

18:44.082 --> 18:50.088
Then I stopped completely,
but he did the same.

18:50.172 --> 18:55.552
So, I laid a trap for him.

19:09.441 --> 19:12.152
There is a sharp
turning of the road,

19:12.236 --> 19:14.196
and I pedaled very quickly
towards this

19:14.321 --> 19:16.865
and then stopped
and waited.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.166
But he seemed to disappear
into thin air.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.836
Can you describe this man?

19:28.919 --> 19:30.879
I realize that you've only
seen him from a distance.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.589
Yes.

19:32.714 --> 19:36.844
He wears a dark suit,
dark spectacles,

19:36.969 --> 19:38.345
and he has a beard.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.013
Young, old?

19:40.097 --> 19:43.684
He's about middle-aged.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.145
Now, let me see if I have
the geography correct.

19:47.229 --> 19:52.276
Here is the road,
with a sharp bend in it here.

19:52.401 --> 19:55.529
On this side,
Charlington Heath,

19:55.654 --> 19:58.407
and on the other,
the woods of Charlington Hall.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.868
How long did you wait for him
here around the bend?

20:00.951 --> 20:02.411
Oh, no more than two minutes.

20:02.536 --> 20:05.164
So he could not have retreated
back down the road.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.707
Are there any side roads?

20:06.790 --> 20:08.792
None along this stretch.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.378
Could he have taken a footpath
across the heath?

20:11.503 --> 20:14.006
Oh, the heath
is totally flat and bleak.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.133
I think I would have
noticed him.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.885
So, by a process of exclusion,

20:17.968 --> 20:21.930
we arrive at the fact that
he made his way towards

20:22.055 --> 20:22.764
Charlington Hall.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.475
Now how does Mr. Carruthers
make his living?

20:25.601 --> 20:27.895
Oh, he's a rich man.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.939
But no carriages or horses.

20:31.023 --> 20:33.859
Well, at least
he's very well off.

20:33.942 --> 20:37.404
He goes into the city
two or three times a week,

20:37.487 --> 20:41.700
and he sometimes refers
to his gold shares.

20:41.783 --> 20:42.784
Yes, I see.

20:42.910 --> 20:43.911
You must let me know
immediately

20:43.994 --> 20:46.497
if there are any fresh
developments.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.499
I am extremely busy
just now,

20:48.624 --> 20:52.252
but I will find time to make
inquiries into your case.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.129
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

20:54.254 --> 20:58.717
In the meantime, take no step
without letting me know.

21:04.139 --> 21:07.976
I'm sure we shall have nothing
but good news for you.

21:08.101 --> 21:12.272
I do hope so, Dr. Watson.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.280
Very lovely girl.

21:20.364 --> 21:21.448
Yes.

21:21.532 --> 21:23.617
And it is part of
the settled order of nature

21:23.700 --> 21:25.410
that such a girl
should have followers,

21:25.494 --> 21:29.790
but for choice, not on bicycles
in lonely country roads.

21:29.915 --> 21:33.627
You really think she may be
in some danger, Holmes?

21:34.336 --> 21:36.672
Oh, yes.

21:39.508 --> 21:40.425
On the following Monday,

21:40.509 --> 21:41.885
Holmes found that
he had business

21:42.010 --> 21:44.096
which detained him in London,

21:44.179 --> 21:47.808
so, he dispatched me on
the early train to Farnham

21:47.891 --> 21:50.018
that I might observe
Miss Smith's passage

21:50.143 --> 21:52.938
past Charlington Hall.

21:53.021 --> 21:56.984
The setting was
just as she had described,

21:57.109 --> 22:00.070
heavily wooded on the side
bordering the hall,

22:00.195 --> 22:03.031
and utterly
exposed on the other.

22:03.115 --> 22:10.539
I selected the only
available cover, and waited.

25:53.971 --> 25:56.723
Watson, you have
wasted your time.

25:56.807 --> 25:57.641
I thought I did rather well.

25:57.766 --> 26:00.227
No, your hiding place
was ill-chosen.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.186
You should have been
in the bracken

26:01.270 --> 26:03.105
on the other
side of the road.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.107
Then that way you would
have had a close view

26:05.232 --> 26:08.235
of this fascinating
solitary cyclist.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.278
Thank you.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.530
As it is, you were
a hundred yards away

26:11.613 --> 26:13.031
and can tell me even less

26:13.115 --> 26:15.492
than Miss Smith reported to us
last Saturday.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.245
You describe him as bending low
over the handle bar?

26:18.328 --> 26:19.705
Yes, quite low.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.331
Thus concealment again,

26:21.456 --> 26:24.668
which in your case
worked perfectly.

26:26.587 --> 26:30.507
Oh know, you really
have done remarkably badly.

26:30.632 --> 26:31.508
He goes back to the Hall

26:31.633 --> 26:34.678
and you come all the way back to
London to call on a house agent.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.847
Well, I found
the information I was seeking.

26:36.972 --> 26:37.890
You found the name Williamson,

26:37.973 --> 26:39.308
which conveys
nothing to my mind.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.059
Well, we know he's elderly
and respectable.

26:41.143 --> 26:43.270
And therefore, unlikely to be
the energetic cyclist

26:43.353 --> 26:46.023
that sprints away from
that athletic young girl.

26:46.148 --> 26:47.274
Well, what should I have done?

26:47.399 --> 26:49.026
Gone to the nearest
public house.

26:49.151 --> 26:51.320
That is the center
of country gossip.

26:51.445 --> 26:52.696
They would have
given you every name

26:52.821 --> 26:54.781
from the master
to the scullery maid.

26:54.865 --> 26:58.660
Instead of which,
you give me--Williamson.

27:08.003 --> 27:11.465
So, what have we gained
by your expedition.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.342
The fact that
the girl's story is true;

27:13.467 --> 27:15.135
I never doubted that.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.011
That there is a connection

27:16.136 --> 27:17.429
between the cyclist
and the Hall;

27:17.513 --> 27:19.306
I never doubted
that, either.

27:19.431 --> 27:24.561
The Hall is tenanted
by a man called Williamson.

27:24.686 --> 27:27.981
Who is the better for that?

27:28.065 --> 27:31.527
I shall go back tomorrow
and visit the public house.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.737
No, my dear sir, do not
commit yourself to rashness

27:33.862 --> 27:37.074
because you are
temporarily depressed.

27:37.199 --> 27:40.661
We can do nothing useful
until Saturday.

27:42.996 --> 27:48.252
Did I really do
remarkably badly?

27:48.377 --> 27:49.920
Yes.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.273
Very beautiful.

28:09.398 --> 28:10.691
Thank you, Mr. Carruthers.

28:10.816 --> 28:12.734
It is a new piece.

28:12.818 --> 28:15.487
I need to
practice it more.

28:15.571 --> 28:18.699
No, I don't mean the music.

28:21.493 --> 28:27.291
Violet, I have
a question to ask you.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.506
Morning, Holmes.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.384
A letter
from Miss Violet Smith.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.929
Now Carruthers has proposed
marriage to her.

28:41.013 --> 28:41.889
Carruthers!

28:41.972 --> 28:45.475
Gentlemen are permitted
to propose marriage, Watson.

28:45.601 --> 28:47.936
Of course he didn't
know about Cyril.

28:48.061 --> 28:50.480
Are you going
to Farnham?

28:50.606 --> 28:53.442
I want to test one or two
theories which I have formed.

28:53.525 --> 28:54.651
Shall I come with you?

28:54.776 --> 28:59.406
No, that will be neither
useful nor necessary.

29:01.325 --> 29:02.743
Try the nearest public house,

29:02.826 --> 29:05.287
always a good center
for country gossip.

29:05.370 --> 29:10.792
Thank you, Watson,
capital notion!

30:23.073 --> 30:25.284
Ah, Good afternoon, Landlord.

30:25.367 --> 30:28.287
May I have half a pint
of your local ale, please?

30:28.370 --> 30:30.664
Certainly, sir.

30:37.379 --> 30:38.463
Here you are.

30:38.547 --> 30:40.799
Thank you.

30:40.883 --> 30:44.428
You may keep the change.

30:44.553 --> 30:48.348
That's most generous
of you, sir, but I couldn't.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.434
I haven't done anything
to warrant such generosity.

30:50.559 --> 30:52.311
I'm about to give you
the opportunity.

30:52.394 --> 30:53.520
I need some information.

30:53.645 --> 30:56.356
Oh, I'm not one
for idle gossip, sir.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.401
Neither am I,
I prefer facts.

30:59.526 --> 31:02.404
Tell me about the people
at Charlington Hall.

31:02.488 --> 31:05.032
You mean
Mr. Williamson, sir?

31:05.157 --> 31:06.158
Yes.

31:06.241 --> 31:08.785
Well, he--he was in here
not more than five minutes ago.

31:08.911 --> 31:09.995
You just missed him.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.079
Tell me about Mr. Williamson.

31:11.205 --> 31:13.290
Is he an elderly,
respectable gentleman?

31:13.415 --> 31:15.918
Oh, he's elderly,
no doubt.

31:16.043 --> 31:18.879
Far be it from me to speak ill
of people behind their backs,

31:18.962 --> 31:20.923
but I'm none too sure
about respectable.

31:21.048 --> 31:21.882
Really?

31:21.965 --> 31:25.636
He is an ex-clergymen,
I reckon.

31:25.761 --> 31:26.887
Ex?

31:27.012 --> 31:28.055
Apparently.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.224
He was struck off,

31:30.307 --> 31:32.392
or whatever it is
happens to clergymen.

31:32.518 --> 31:35.270
That's doctors
that are struck off.

31:35.395 --> 31:38.273
Tell me about the other people
up at the house.

31:38.357 --> 31:40.734
Well, they're
just domestic staff,

31:40.817 --> 31:42.861
and they're all
local and God-fearing.

31:42.945 --> 31:45.072
Of course.

31:45.155 --> 31:48.992
He do have folk up there
at weekends.

31:51.912 --> 31:52.788
Weekends?

31:52.913 --> 31:56.083
Yes, sir.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.544
Weekends.

31:58.627 --> 32:01.755
Ah, no problem.
What sort of folk?

32:01.839 --> 32:03.298
Oh, they're a warm lot.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.299
Warm?

32:04.424 --> 32:06.969
Yes, the sort you
don't want to get too near

32:07.094 --> 32:09.763
for fear of getting
burnt like.

32:09.847 --> 32:11.765
That's good.

32:11.849 --> 32:15.102
Oh, you may
think it's good, sir.

32:15.227 --> 32:18.272
They don't come down well
in the village, I can tell you.

32:18.397 --> 32:21.024
There was one fellow
in particular.

32:21.149 --> 32:23.360
Particularly warm,
is he, this fellow?

32:23.485 --> 32:26.488
He is very particularly, sir.

32:26.613 --> 32:29.616
I'll wager he has
a red mustache.

32:29.741 --> 32:32.786
Hey, do you know him?

32:32.911 --> 32:34.872
I never met the gentleman.

32:34.997 --> 32:37.291
Well, now is your chance.

32:40.586 --> 32:42.254
Mr. Woodley.

32:42.337 --> 32:45.507
None of your damn business!

32:45.632 --> 32:47.801
Our Landlord keeps
a very respectable house,

32:47.926 --> 32:49.469
and your language
is not welcome.

32:49.595 --> 32:50.554
Who do you think you are?

32:50.679 --> 32:54.057
What the hell do you want coming
here asking all them questions?

32:54.183 --> 32:56.810
You're quite right, Landlord,
clearly not a gentleman.

32:56.894 --> 32:59.188
Oh, I'm as much a gentleman
as you are.

33:08.030 --> 33:09.865
Everybody here will
bear witness to the fact

33:09.990 --> 33:13.577
that I am acting
in self-defense.

33:32.387 --> 33:33.055
Swine!

33:33.180 --> 33:34.890
No, sir,
a gentleman!

33:35.015 --> 33:37.643
Only a ruffian deals a blow
with the back of a hand.

33:37.726 --> 33:41.355
A gentleman uses
the straight--left...

33:41.438 --> 33:43.732
and I, sir,
am a gentleman!

34:27.275 --> 34:30.904
It was absolutely
delicious, Watson.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.531
So I see.

34:32.614 --> 34:37.077
A straight left
against a slogging ruffian.

34:37.202 --> 34:40.205
I emerged, as you see.

34:40.289 --> 34:42.791
And the slogging ruffian?

34:42.916 --> 34:47.545
Mr. Woodley was taken home
in a cart.

34:56.763 --> 35:00.142
There's that
horrible man again.

35:03.812 --> 35:05.522
Which man?

35:34.968 --> 35:38.847
I thought I saw Mr. Woodley
in the garden today.

35:38.972 --> 35:42.309
You did.
He's staying in the area.

35:42.392 --> 35:45.604
But do not worry,
I have told him quite firmly

35:45.687 --> 35:49.274
he's not to set foot
inside the house.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.152
"Dear Mr. Holmes:

35:52.236 --> 35:54.279
You will not be
surprised to learn

35:54.363 --> 35:56.740
that I will be leaving
Mr. Carruthers's employment

35:56.865 --> 35:59.159
on Saturday."

36:01.954 --> 36:06.333
The odious Mr. Woodley has
reappeared at Chiltern Grange.

36:06.416 --> 36:10.546
Ah, but at least she won't be
bicycling to the station.

36:10.671 --> 36:14.675
So finally,
the rich Mr. Carruthers

36:14.800 --> 36:16.343
has acquired
a horse and trap.

36:16.468 --> 36:17.386
Yes.

36:17.469 --> 36:22.808
Look here, "all my troubles
will be over on Saturday."

36:22.891 --> 36:27.813
Tomorrow, Holmes,
all her troubles will be over.

36:27.896 --> 36:30.524
Why do I
worry about that word.

36:30.649 --> 36:32.359
Which word?

36:32.484 --> 36:34.903
"Trap."

37:42.638 --> 37:45.724
Oh, what a splendid morning,
Holmes!

37:45.807 --> 37:47.559
It's acceptable weather
for the time of year.

37:47.643 --> 37:50.437
Now who would want to harm that
dear girl on such a morning?

37:50.562 --> 37:51.980
I hope nobody.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.774
So why did you
bring your revolver?

37:53.857 --> 37:58.278
I'm talking about my hope,
not my expec-tations.

37:58.862 --> 38:00.823
What?

38:02.616 --> 38:07.913
I fancy that
is our Miss Smith.

38:07.996 --> 38:10.499
She must be traveling
by an earlier train.

38:10.624 --> 38:12.125
I give her a margin
of half an hour,

38:12.251 --> 38:13.752
but she'll be
past Charlington Hall

38:13.836 --> 38:16.213
before we can
possibly meet her.

38:16.338 --> 38:18.465
So what can we do?

38:18.590 --> 38:21.468
We could run.

38:25.347 --> 38:30.227
Fool, I should have allowed
for that earlier train!

38:56.044 --> 38:57.963
It's abduction,

38:58.046 --> 39:02.259
Watson, it's abduction,
murder, heaven knows what.

39:02.384 --> 39:05.846
Stop that horse.

39:19.401 --> 39:21.403
Good man.

39:21.487 --> 39:24.406
Come on, Watson!

39:24.490 --> 39:28.952
Let's see if I can repair the
consequences of my own blunder!

40:03.111 --> 40:05.322
Up there!

40:32.307 --> 40:34.101
Holmes.

40:34.226 --> 40:36.270
Where did you get that cart?!

40:36.395 --> 40:38.730
Where is Miss Violet Smith?!

40:38.814 --> 40:42.609
That's what I'm asking you.
You were in her cart!

40:42.734 --> 40:45.445
It was on the road,
there was no one in it!

40:45.529 --> 40:50.159
Somebody seems to have
gone through this way!

40:53.787 --> 40:55.873
We must find them!

40:55.998 --> 40:58.542
Come, Watson.

41:03.005 --> 41:07.217
Now look,
do you know who this is?!

41:07.342 --> 41:08.343
That's Peter, the groom,

41:08.468 --> 41:10.179
he was taking her
to the station.

41:10.304 --> 41:12.306
He's alive,
his pulse is strong.

41:12.389 --> 41:13.765
Mustn't be left
lying there too long.

41:13.849 --> 41:15.475
Let him lie,
we can't do him any good,

41:15.559 --> 41:17.269
but we might save her
from the worst fate

41:17.352 --> 41:18.979
that can befall a woman.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.647
Where are you going?!

41:20.772 --> 41:21.607
The house!

41:21.690 --> 41:22.983
They didn't go
to the house!

41:23.108 --> 41:26.028
They went this way
to the left.

41:26.153 --> 41:26.945
Are you sure?

41:29.323 --> 41:30.782
Oh, cowardly dogs!

41:30.866 --> 41:31.533
Too late!

41:31.658 --> 41:32.326
Watson.

41:32.451 --> 41:37.331
Too late by the living Jingo!

41:51.929 --> 41:54.431
For as much
as John and Violet

41:54.556 --> 41:58.477
have consented together
in holy wedlock,

41:58.602 --> 42:05.359
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

42:09.530 --> 42:11.031
and have declared the same

42:11.156 --> 42:13.700
by the giving
and receiving of a ring,

42:13.826 --> 42:16.620
and the joining of hands,

42:16.745 --> 42:24.378
I pronounce that
they be man and wife, together.

42:25.879 --> 42:27.965
Congratulations!

42:28.090 --> 42:31.385
Thanks, amen.

42:31.468 --> 42:33.595
They're married!

42:36.849 --> 42:39.393
Welcome to the party,
gentlemen.

42:39.518 --> 42:44.106
Let me introduce you
to Mrs. Woodley.

42:44.231 --> 42:46.900
Don't Carruthers!

42:47.025 --> 42:48.986
Carruthers!

42:57.369 --> 42:59.663
Yes, and I'll see
this woman righted,

42:59.788 --> 43:01.498
if I have to swing for it.

43:01.623 --> 43:02.624
You're too late.

43:02.749 --> 43:04.543
She is my wife!

43:04.626 --> 43:08.422
No, she's your widow.

43:09.298 --> 43:11.133
I told you what I'd do
if you molested her!

43:11.258 --> 43:14.094
By the Lord,
I'm a man of my word!

43:16.180 --> 43:18.098
When you hired me,

43:18.182 --> 43:22.060
nobody told me there'd be
any of this damn nonsense!

43:22.144 --> 43:23.562
Drop that pistol.

43:23.645 --> 43:26.356
Watson, pick it up!

43:28.859 --> 43:30.652
Give me that revolver,
we'll have no more violence.

43:30.777 --> 43:32.112
Who are you
to be giving these orders?

43:32.196 --> 43:34.573
Sherlock Holmes.

43:34.656 --> 43:35.949
Good Lord.

43:37.451 --> 43:38.952
Here, you!

43:39.077 --> 43:40.746
Sir?

43:40.829 --> 43:42.414
Are you well enough
to drive into Farnham?

43:42.498 --> 43:44.958
Yes, sir,
I reckon I am.

43:45.042 --> 43:45.626
Then give this note

43:45.751 --> 43:50.506
to the superintendent
of the police station.

43:50.631 --> 43:51.298
In the meantime,

43:51.381 --> 43:55.969
I must detain you all under
my own personal custody.

44:26.124 --> 44:28.168
How are the patients, Doctor?

44:28.252 --> 44:30.212
Miss Smith's very well,

44:30.337 --> 44:33.674
considering the foul way
she's been treated.

44:33.799 --> 44:35.133
And Woodley?

44:35.217 --> 44:37.845
Alas, I have no doubt
he will live.

44:37.928 --> 44:39.972
What, I'll go upstairs
and finish him off.

44:40.055 --> 44:43.350
No, sit down in that chair,
Carruthers.

44:43.475 --> 44:44.226
You're right.

44:44.351 --> 44:46.228
He isn't worth
swinging for.

44:46.353 --> 44:47.145
But do you tell me
that girl

44:47.229 --> 44:49.523
is to be tied to
Roaring Jack Woodley for life?!

44:49.606 --> 44:51.066
You needn't concern
yourself about that.

44:51.191 --> 44:53.402
I married them
till death do them part.

44:53.527 --> 44:58.907
Under no circumstances can she
be considered his wife.

44:58.991 --> 45:00.492
Are you sure?

45:00.617 --> 45:03.704
For two very good reasons.

45:03.787 --> 45:04.371
In the first place,

45:04.496 --> 45:07.541
we are very safe in questioning
Mr. Williamson's right

45:07.666 --> 45:09.084
to solemnize a marriage.

45:09.209 --> 45:10.752
I have been ordained.

45:10.878 --> 45:12.171
And unfrocked.

45:12.254 --> 45:15.382
Once a clergyman,
always a clergyman.

45:17.759 --> 45:20.345
I think not.

45:20.429 --> 45:22.806
How about the license?

45:22.931 --> 45:26.518
Oh, we had a license.

45:26.602 --> 45:29.521
I have it here.

45:29.605 --> 45:31.857
Undoubtedly obtained
by a trick.

45:31.940 --> 45:34.568
But, in any case, a forced
marriage is no marriage,

45:34.651 --> 45:38.071
indeed, it is a very serious
felony, as you will discover.

45:38.155 --> 45:43.535
Now, while we are waiting
for the police, Mr. Carruthers,

45:43.619 --> 45:47.122
you might tell me
your story.

45:47.247 --> 45:51.335
If you squeal on us,
Bob Carruthers,

45:51.460 --> 45:54.880
I'll serve you
as you served Jack Woodley!

45:55.005 --> 45:56.548
There's no need for you
to get over-excited.

45:56.632 --> 45:59.009
The case is clear enough.

45:59.134 --> 46:05.057
Well, if it's clear enough,
why don't you tell us.

46:05.182 --> 46:06.725
Very well.

46:06.808 --> 46:09.102
Mr. Carruthers will have
to fill in a few details

46:09.186 --> 46:11.104
for my private curiosity,

46:11.188 --> 46:14.858
but I am happy
to do the talking.

46:14.983 --> 46:15.609
In the first place,

46:15.734 --> 46:17.861
the three of you came across
from South Africa.

46:17.986 --> 46:21.281
Wrong, I've never even been
in South Africa!

46:23.075 --> 46:25.452
It's true.

46:25.536 --> 46:32.000
Woodley acquired this creature
after our return.

46:32.125 --> 46:33.585
Very well,
you and Woodley

46:33.710 --> 46:37.130
had known Ralph Smith
in South Africa.

46:37.214 --> 46:40.008
You had reason to believe
that he would not live long,

46:40.133 --> 46:44.638
and you found out that his niece
would inherit his fortune.

46:44.763 --> 46:45.722
How's that?

46:45.848 --> 46:48.559
But you told the girl
her uncle died in poverty.

46:48.684 --> 46:52.187
Well, as he was still alive,
admittedly only just,

46:52.312 --> 46:56.567
and a wealthy man who
I suspect had made no will.

46:56.692 --> 46:59.945
Ralph Smith
could neither read nor write.

47:00.028 --> 47:05.325
So, you and Woodley came over
here and hunted up the girl,

47:05.450 --> 47:08.412
knowing she was
the next of kin,

47:08.537 --> 47:10.539
and that you would
share the plunder.

47:10.664 --> 47:14.710
I was due a share
for services rendered.

47:14.835 --> 47:17.045
And Carruthers,

47:17.171 --> 47:25.345
you made the mistake
of falling in love with her.

47:25.470 --> 47:28.891
The first time that ever I knew
what love was, Mr. Holmes.

47:29.016 --> 47:34.271
Why didn't you tell her
of the danger she was in?

47:34.396 --> 47:43.739
Because--because
she would have left me,

47:43.822 --> 47:49.745
and I couldn't bear
to face that.

47:49.870 --> 47:57.127
Oh, what will happen
to my daughter, Sarah?

47:57.252 --> 48:01.256
We'll see she's
well taken care of.

48:05.302 --> 48:10.724
You see, even if
she couldn't love me,

48:10.807 --> 48:13.852
it meant a great deal
to see her about the house

48:13.936 --> 48:18.190
and hear the sound
of her voice.

48:18.273 --> 48:21.860
You may call it love,
Mr. Carruthers,

48:21.944 --> 48:24.905
I should call it
selfishness.

48:26.323 --> 48:31.078
Maybe the two things
go together.

48:31.203 --> 48:32.579
But I tried to protect her,

48:32.704 --> 48:34.039
I never once let her go
past this house

48:34.122 --> 48:35.916
where I knew those rascals
were lurking

48:35.999 --> 48:37.626
without following her
on my bicycle

48:37.751 --> 48:40.587
to see she
came to no harm.

48:40.671 --> 48:43.632
I kept my distance
and wore that beard

48:43.715 --> 48:46.218
so she should not
recognize me.

48:46.301 --> 48:50.055
Then I presume
the cable arrived?

48:50.138 --> 48:53.600
Cable, what cable?

49:04.361 --> 49:06.196
"THE OLD MAN IS DEAD."

49:06.321 --> 49:08.740
What old man?

49:08.824 --> 49:12.035
I imagine Ralph Smith
in South Africa.

49:12.161 --> 49:13.203
Yes.

49:13.328 --> 49:15.038
But by this time you and Woodley
had quarreled

49:15.164 --> 49:16.707
and he had left the house.

49:16.832 --> 49:20.836
Woodley came back again to ask
me to stick to the bargain.

49:20.961 --> 49:22.588
I refused.

49:22.671 --> 49:25.674
I said I would have
nothing to do with violence.

49:27.593 --> 49:34.057
One last detail,

49:34.183 --> 49:39.897
why was Woodley chosen
as the prospective husband?

49:42.191 --> 49:46.028
I am ashamed to say it...

49:49.198 --> 49:52.826
we played cards for her.

50:26.068 --> 50:29.696
Holmes, I have the results
of the trial.

50:29.822 --> 50:35.494
Listen to this, the judge
in summing up said--

50:37.746 --> 50:39.164
Holmes.

50:39.248 --> 50:43.544
Watson, may I be permitted
an educated guess?

50:45.504 --> 50:47.381
Go on then.

50:47.464 --> 50:49.925
I would expect Woodley
to get ten years,

50:50.050 --> 50:52.010
Williamson seven years,

50:52.135 --> 50:53.720
and Carruthers,

50:53.804 --> 50:57.933
in view of the eloquent speech I
made on his behalf at the trial,

50:58.058 --> 50:59.893
probably six months.

51:01.812 --> 51:05.691
That is exactly right!

51:05.774 --> 51:08.569
Well, I have
certain advantages, Watson,

51:08.652 --> 51:13.115
largely the fact that I sent out
for the early edition.

51:13.240 --> 51:16.243
An undoubted advantage.

51:16.368 --> 51:18.078
Also, we have received
a present,

51:18.203 --> 51:22.124
some wedding cake from
Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Morton,

51:22.207 --> 51:23.083
together with a letter

51:23.167 --> 51:26.753
telling us that Mrs. Morton has
inherited a large sum of money

51:26.879 --> 51:31.216
from her uncle, Ralph Smith,
formerly of South Africa.

51:31.300 --> 51:32.676
The happy couple
are thoroughly enjoying

51:32.801 --> 51:35.137
looking after young
Sarah Carruthers,

51:35.262 --> 51:38.140
while her father
is in custody.

51:38.223 --> 51:40.100
Her piano playing
is improving

51:40.184 --> 51:43.604
and she wants to
take up bicycling.

51:43.687 --> 51:47.733
A splendid day all round,
wouldn't you say?

51:47.816 --> 51:50.027
There is more splendor
yet to come.

51:50.152 --> 51:52.362
More splendor,
what do you mean?

51:55.157 --> 51:57.284
Watch carefully.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.953
Oh, I remember,

52:00.037 --> 52:01.705
the chemical reaction
that will solve the mystery

52:01.830 --> 52:04.750
concerning the persecution
of Mr. John Vincent Harden.

52:04.833 --> 52:05.459
Precisely.

52:05.584 --> 52:08.045
I've spent the entire week
in the lmperial Science Museum

52:08.170 --> 52:13.342
and I think
this is the answer.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.668
Is that the answer, Holmes?

52:47.751 --> 52:51.505
Yes, that is the answer,
Watson.

52:51.588 --> 52:53.715
Well, let me think.
