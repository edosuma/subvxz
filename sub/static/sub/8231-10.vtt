00:09.100 --> 00:10.633
- Movie night, baby.
I love it.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.167
- Yeah. What are you sitting in?
I'm not mad at it.

00:12.167 --> 00:13.667
- You can't be mad at this.
- No.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.167
- The real question here

00:15.167 --> 00:17.700
is how not mad are you
at this beer mug?

00:17.700 --> 00:20.267
- Oh, very un-mad.
It's a lot of fun.

00:20.267 --> 00:21.800
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.833
Let's kick things off here
with a foot job comp.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.933
- All right.
- Okay. Let's do it.

00:27.933 --> 00:30.667
[smacking]

00:30.667 --> 00:32.267
- Huh.
- Hmm.

00:32.267 --> 00:33.767
- You know, not my porno.
Mm-mm.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.500
Why don't we go bottom right,
right there?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.600
That butt--
that butt's just winking at me.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.000
[woman moaning]

00:40.000 --> 00:41.233
- Mmm, nope.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.833
Not my porno.
- She's cute.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.000
A little Amy Schumer looking.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.700
[woman moaning]

00:45.700 --> 00:48.367
No.
He's rushing. Not my porno.

00:48.367 --> 00:49.467
- Pace yourself, bud.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.200
- Geez.
- You know?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.500
- Hey! How are you?

00:53.500 --> 00:54.900
- Howdy.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.667
- Can't see through the sheet,
can they?

00:58.667 --> 01:00.767
- No. I wouldn't think so.
No.

01:00.767 --> 01:04.833
[hip-hop music]

01:04.833 --> 01:07.267
- * I'm fresh *

01:07.267 --> 01:08.400
- * You gotta, you gotta

01:08.400 --> 01:09.533
* You gotta, gotta

01:09.533 --> 01:10.667
- * Gotta be fresh

01:12.567 --> 01:14.200
- I mean what are we doing?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.867
What happened to porno?
- That's what I was thinking.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.533
- I feel like it's lost
all of its nuance.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.500
- That's right.
Now, it's just--

01:19.500 --> 01:22.633
it's like a jackhammer just
plugging away at a Realdoll,

01:22.633 --> 01:24.433
which I've actually
seen that video before,

01:24.433 --> 01:25.967
and I liked it more than this.
- Yeah.

01:25.967 --> 01:29.133
I'm sorry, I like my porn stars
with acting chops.

01:29.133 --> 01:32.067
- Yes, they should also
have very expressive eyes

01:32.067 --> 01:34.300
while they're kind of--
- Honestly, I miss Dan Yella.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.233
I mean what a porn star.
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.300
- Dare I say starred
in the greatest porno

01:39.300 --> 01:40.333
of all time,

01:40.333 --> 01:41.567
"The Nutting Professor."

01:41.567 --> 01:43.067
- Oh, you're dating yourself.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.300
- I am.
I am a little bit.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.333
- And Dan Yella,
what a performance.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.400
Are you kidding me?
Seven different roles.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.200
Remember the aunt
in the fat suit?

01:50.200 --> 01:51.467
- "Oh, jerk it, please!

01:51.467 --> 01:52.833
Jerk it, please!"
- Yes. Thank you.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.067
- Oh, the roll around
the dinner table.

01:55.067 --> 01:56.300
- And what a body.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.833
I didn't mind all the pubes.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.433
I mean they were everywhere.
I didn't care.

01:59.433 --> 02:02.133
- I mean there's literally
no other man

02:02.133 --> 02:04.333
I'd rather watch do sex.
- Yeah.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.700
- You know what?

02:05.700 --> 02:08.633
To Mr. Dan Yella,
our porno daddy.

02:08.633 --> 02:11.733
- To Dan Yella.
- Mr. Dan Yella.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.367
- Well, after scouring
the Internet,

02:13.367 --> 02:14.367
I couldn't find
"The Nutting Professor,"

02:14.367 --> 02:15.667
and I checked Brazzers,

02:15.667 --> 02:19.167
Bangbros, Mofos,
Rancho [bleep], PornHub,

02:19.167 --> 02:20.733
and YouPorn.
- I know.

02:20.733 --> 02:23.967
And I tried PornTube, Fapdu,
Youjizz, Jizzpros.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.767
I even tried
Sublime Directory.

02:25.767 --> 02:27.600
- Did you just say
"Sublime Directory"?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.700
- Uh, yes, I did.
- Found it! Yup.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.533
And it wasn't on xHamster,
8th St. Latinas,

02:32.533 --> 02:35.067
Captain Stabbin,
or Mike in Brazil.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.767
- I love Mike in Brazil,

02:36.767 --> 02:38.233
'cause he was in an apartment,
and then he went to Brazil.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.067
- This is a cool way
to see Brazil.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.267
- See the world, really.

02:41.267 --> 02:42.467
- Guess where I did find it,
though.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.367
- Where?
- EBay. Yeah.

02:44.367 --> 02:45.900
Two VHS copies,

02:45.900 --> 02:48.433
and I'm currently
the highest bidder.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.067
- That is awesome.

02:50.067 --> 02:51.967
- Yeah. Get on over here, dude.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.767
Check it out. So I've just been
in this bidding war

02:53.767 --> 02:56.533
with "MRNULEAF,"
and there's, well,

02:56.533 --> 02:58.767
there's 30 seconds left, so...

02:58.767 --> 03:00.533
I just thought
of something cool.

03:00.533 --> 03:01.867
- What?
- What if we make a pact to,

03:01.867 --> 03:04.067
like, not crank down
until we get the movie?

03:04.067 --> 03:05.700
- Yeah, okay.
That sounds like a good--

03:05.700 --> 03:07.667
- Bad idea.
That's, like, not cool, right?

03:07.667 --> 03:10.533
- You know, I--and that's where
I disagree with you, Anders.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.067
I think it's necessary

03:12.067 --> 03:15.400
because we must show respect
for Dan Yella, right?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.067
- I don't know.
I don't know.

03:17.067 --> 03:19.333
- You're acting a little weird.
- I'm not being weird.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.567
- Five seconds. Five seconds.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.967
- Four, three, two.
Hit it. Hit it.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.700
- That was too early.
- You gotta--

03:24.700 --> 03:27.700
[all shouting]
- I won! Yeah! We won! We won!

03:27.700 --> 03:29.600
- Congratulations.
Good stuff, babe.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.100
- So we won't crank down?
- Yeah.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.367
- No cranking down.
- Okay.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.100
That's official.
That's fine.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.400
- I don't even know what to do
since we can't jerk off.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.700
I guess have some toast.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.800
- Man.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.433
You guys ever notice DiDi
got a real booty on her?

03:49.267 --> 03:50.833
- I've never noticed that.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.700
- No, I was waiting for
that notification on my phone

03:52.700 --> 03:54.200
about the package
getting home.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.433
- When we get home, I call dibs
on watching it first.

03:56.433 --> 03:59.067
- No, no, no, no, no.
Let me get it.

03:59.067 --> 04:00.600
- Ders, what's going on?

04:00.600 --> 04:04.067
Is something wrong?

04:04.067 --> 04:06.267
- Okay. I--

04:06.267 --> 04:09.233
It was May 29, 2001.

04:09.233 --> 04:10.633
I was on vaycay with my parents,

04:10.633 --> 04:12.867
and we were staying
in the same room,

04:12.867 --> 04:15.267
so I couldn't stroke my dog.

04:15.267 --> 04:16.667
Believe me, I tried.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.267
One day,
they went horseback riding

04:18.267 --> 04:21.367
and dropped me off at a taping
of VH1's "Storytellers."

04:21.367 --> 04:24.833
- Can you tell the story faster?
'Cause it's super boring.

04:24.833 --> 04:27.067
- No, no, no.
Keep this pace.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.467
Mm-mmm. That's my tempo.

04:28.467 --> 04:33.567
- Anyway, the artist
was Natalie Imbruglia,

04:33.567 --> 04:35.400
and she was singing
her song, "Torn."

04:35.400 --> 04:38.433
- And then you ejacked
in your little boy pants.

04:38.433 --> 04:41.400
- No. What are you--okay.
Yes, I did.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.733
But it was a whole bunch.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.767
I fainted,
and I had to go to the doctor.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.067
So I've jacked off
every day since,

04:47.067 --> 04:50.500
and it's been three days, so
I think I need first dibs, okay?

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
- Okay.
- Great.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.533
- Yeah. That's fine.

04:52.533 --> 04:54.133
I care so little.
- Yeah.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.733
- So you didn't even need
to tell that stupid story.

04:55.733 --> 04:57.267
- He's right.
That story really fizzled.

04:57.267 --> 04:58.767
- It was bad,
and they always are.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.133
That's the thing
about your stories.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.633
And no offense--
- Package is at the house.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.267
Package is at the house.
Let's go.

05:05.267 --> 05:06.967
It's almost 5:00, right?
We can go, right? Let's go.

05:06.967 --> 05:08.200
Let's go.
- All right, yeah.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.467
Now we're talking.

05:09.467 --> 05:10.900
[tires screech]

05:10.900 --> 05:13.400
- All right.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.633
Whoo!

05:17.367 --> 05:18.433
It's not here.

05:18.433 --> 05:19.667
- Huh?
- It's not here!

05:19.667 --> 05:20.967
- What?
- What are you talking about?

05:20.967 --> 05:22.800
Where is it?
- Okay. Don't panic.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.933
Probably had a neighbor
sign for it.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.767
- Yeah.
That's probably what it is.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.333
No reason to panic.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.700
[knocking]

05:30.700 --> 05:31.767
Hey.
- Hello.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.700
- Dean, how's it going?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.067
We're just wondering if you
signed for a package for us?

05:36.067 --> 05:37.700
[dogs barking]
- No. I didn't for anything.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.500
Packages probably got stolen.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.867
I've had a bunch taken recently.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.533
Honey, can you call the dogs?

05:42.533 --> 05:43.700
Shake the treat box.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.067
Shake the treat box!
Sorry.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.800
I'd say maybe try
the neighborhood watch,

05:47.800 --> 05:49.633
although they've been
fairly useless recently.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.200
- Yeah.
Hey, you know what?

05:51.200 --> 05:53.067
We should start
a vigilante group of our own

05:53.067 --> 05:55.167
to catch this guy.
- God damn it!

05:55.167 --> 05:56.733
Shake the treat box, Vicki!

05:56.733 --> 05:58.200
- No. I'm serious, man.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.867
We could be, like, superheroes.
We could wear costumes.

06:00.867 --> 06:03.067
- Ah, or we couldn't
wear costumes

06:03.067 --> 06:06.067
'cause it's a dumb idea,
right, Ders?

06:06.067 --> 06:07.333
- Yup.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.733
- And that's why
you're my best friend.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.267
- That's why I love you, man.
- Great.

06:10.267 --> 06:11.967
- I really do.
Hey, Dean-o, what got stolen?

06:11.967 --> 06:13.600
- Dude, I ordered
this awesome inflatable chair,

06:13.600 --> 06:14.867
this cowboy boot-shaped mug.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.367
You guys should
come over sometime.

06:16.367 --> 06:17.867
We can do beers,
watch a Blues game.

06:17.867 --> 06:19.900
- Yeah.
You know, maybe we will.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.467
And thanks for the help today.
Appreciate it.

06:21.467 --> 06:22.633
- Well, good luck, guys.
- Yeah, thanks.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.633
You're a good guy.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.067
- Blues game.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.067
- Okay, yeah.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.433
I stole some things from Dean.

06:27.433 --> 06:29.700
- We need to trap this guy
who stole our package

06:29.700 --> 06:32.400
and get our tape back
so I can evacuate.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.133
- And that's why vigilante group
is a great idea.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.067
- I don't think so.
- Check it out.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.700
Beat-Ass.
- I don't like that.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.600
- That's just Kick-Ass.
- No.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.167
- Yeah.
It's Kick-Ass, basically.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.533
- Adam, I heard you,
since you had this conversation

06:44.533 --> 06:45.767
on my front step.

06:45.767 --> 06:47.733
I want my stuff back, buddy.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.500
- Scoot! Scoot!

06:49.500 --> 06:50.600
- Go, go!
- Scoot!

06:50.600 --> 06:52.067
- Bye, Dean!
- All right.

06:52.067 --> 06:53.967
So you're buried in the ground.
- I am, yes.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.167
- Now, I'm gonna put this box
over your head, right,

06:56.167 --> 06:58.667
and I wrote
"valuable electronics:

06:58.667 --> 06:59.667
do not touch" on it.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.067
When he takes the box--

07:01.067 --> 07:02.667
[hisses]

07:02.667 --> 07:04.567
Spray him with the mace.
- Yeah.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.300
- Meanwhile, Blake and I, we're
gonna be over here in the 'Vo.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.133
We're gonna jump out.
We're gonna pounce.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.500
- No, no, no, no, no.
Gnargoyle doesn't sit in cars.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.333
I already told you this.
He perches high above the city,

07:13.333 --> 07:17.667
and then swoops down on his zip
line when the city needs him.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.933
- Your shirt says "eat-ass."

07:19.933 --> 07:20.767
- What?

07:20.767 --> 07:22.700
Oh, God dang it.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.067
The "B" keeps falling off.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.900
- Hey, how are you gonna
be fighting crime

07:25.900 --> 07:27.700
when you're busy
eating ass all day?

07:27.700 --> 07:31.067
- You're not gonna be laughing
when the Gnargoyle swoops down

07:31.067 --> 07:34.400
and wreaks vigilante justice
upon the city.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.500
Yeah. You want to know
what else isn't funny?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.967
Made a Facebook page
for Beat-Ass.

07:37.967 --> 07:39.967
Already got two likes.
- That's cool.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.667
You found two guys
on the Internet

07:41.667 --> 07:43.267
who wanted to get together
and eat each other's butts.

07:43.267 --> 07:45.067
Very cool.
- [laughs]

07:45.067 --> 07:47.667
Oh!
That was the best one yet.

07:55.067 --> 07:58.167
- Evil lurks in Cucamonga.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.867
A hero waits.

07:59.867 --> 08:04.767
His lower thigh's really
starting to hurt from perching.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.333
- Hey, guys?

08:06.333 --> 08:07.967
I'm getting hungry.

08:07.967 --> 08:09.967
Can one of you go make
me a grilled cheese?

08:09.967 --> 08:12.433
- Shh!
Quiet!

08:12.433 --> 08:14.667
You're gonna ruin this.
You believe this guy?

08:14.667 --> 08:16.700
It's like this is
his first stakeout or something.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.133
- Shut up. Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

08:22.433 --> 08:23.867
- Is it on?
- Yeah.

08:23.867 --> 08:25.700
We're ready. Let's do this.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.700
[coughs]

08:32.433 --> 08:33.900
- I've got visual,

08:33.900 --> 08:37.933
and it looks like a black guy
in a hoodie.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.600
It's probably our guy, man.
- Oh, whoa.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.167
Being black and wearing a hoodie
is not a crime, okay?

08:44.167 --> 08:45.600
Come on.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.333
- No. No, no. I know.
I'm not saying that.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.833
I'm saying obviously,
he could be anybody.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.067
He could be a dentist or a judge

08:51.067 --> 08:54.167
or a Prince of Bel-Air
or something.

09:01.367 --> 09:04.067
- [coughing]
Crazy dirty down here.

09:05.433 --> 09:07.200
[sneezes]

09:09.067 --> 09:10.733
[both scream]

09:10.733 --> 09:12.600
- Halt!

09:12.600 --> 09:15.967
- Flying drop kick attack!

09:17.600 --> 09:19.067
Ow!

09:19.067 --> 09:20.600
- Hey. Okay. Okay.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.400
We know you're the robber,
so just give us the porno.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.900
- Yeah.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.067
- What? I'm here to join
a group called Beat-Ass.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.400
- Oh, you made it.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.667
Welcome to Beat-Ass HQ.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.433
- How many? How many fingers
am I holding up? How many?

09:34.433 --> 09:36.667
- 16?
- Are you happy?

09:36.667 --> 09:40.100
Your friend over here ruined
our plan and blinded Adam.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.300
- Okay.
He has a name, all right,

09:41.300 --> 09:42.900
which I don't know, actually.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.067
What is your name, friend?

09:44.067 --> 09:45.500
- My real name's Brian,

09:45.500 --> 09:48.900
but my superhero name
is Dr. Heals-good.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.633
- Okay. Very positive.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.067
Mine is actually
the Gnargoyle.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.100
- Hey, Blake.
- What?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.400
- It's all well and good,

09:55.400 --> 09:57.333
but I am [bleep] blind
over here!

09:57.333 --> 10:02.233
- Well, they don't call me
Dr. Heals-good for no reason.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.933
- Wait.
Are you, like, a real doctor?

10:03.933 --> 10:06.233
- With my best friend, Chester,

10:06.233 --> 10:09.267
I can heal people with
the greatest medicine of all,

10:09.267 --> 10:10.567
laughter.

10:10.567 --> 10:11.800
- I'm out of penicillin.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.767
- That was funny.
- This, I hate.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.233
- Who's Chester?

10:15.233 --> 10:16.933
- He's a dummy, Adam.
- 'Kay, Ders.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.033
Not everybody's dummies, okay?

10:19.033 --> 10:21.800
I'm so sorry.
Chester, please.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.167
Welcome to our home.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.867
- This is ridiculous, okay?

10:24.867 --> 10:26.700
We have no porno!
I'm on eBay.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.867
I'm bidding on another copy
of "The Nutting Professor."

10:28.867 --> 10:30.467
It's gonna be delivered
to the office where

10:30.467 --> 10:33.067
it's gonna require a signature
so no one can steal it.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.267
- I remember that movie.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.900
- "Jerk it, please!
Jerk it please!"

10:35.900 --> 10:37.533
[laughter]

10:37.533 --> 10:39.033
- I mean I can't believe

10:39.033 --> 10:41.400
the doctor says I'm only
gonna be blind for a week.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.867
It sucks, dude,

10:42.867 --> 10:45.500
because I could totally get
chicks like this, right?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.000
Like, "Hey. What's up, bro?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.500
"Oh. Oh, sorry.
You're a girl.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.833
These are your boobs."

10:49.833 --> 10:51.567
- Yeah, can you--
can you not squeeze

10:51.567 --> 10:54.900
perfect large air breasts
in front of me, man?

10:54.900 --> 10:56.133
When am I gonna
get this package?

10:56.133 --> 10:57.800
Give me a notification, baby.
Come on.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.467
- I'll play with her boobs
all I want, Ders.

10:59.467 --> 11:02.433
Why don't you just tie a rubber
band around your ding-dong?

11:02.433 --> 11:03.333
- What?
- Yeah.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.067
That way, you can't ejack.

11:05.067 --> 11:06.500
You know what?
- What?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.567
- I bet I'm gonna have,
like, superhero powers.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.867
Like, my other senses are gonna
be more on blast, right?

11:11.867 --> 11:14.067
Like Daredevil or something.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.067
- Hey, guys.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.067
- Oh!
- Oh.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.800
- Ders, I heard Jillian,

11:17.800 --> 11:21.067
like, clear as day
from across the office.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.800
- Yeah, she's right here
in a skirt.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.067
- Shut up. I smell it.

11:25.067 --> 11:26.600
She's eating something.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.700
It's like--

11:27.700 --> 11:29.333
it's, like, grapes or, like,

11:29.333 --> 11:31.967
peanut butter or--like, peanut
buttery grapes or, like--

11:31.967 --> 11:34.933
- Oh, no. That's--
- No! Oh, Jesus Christ.

11:34.933 --> 11:36.933
- Adam, are you okay?
You okay?

11:36.933 --> 11:38.200
- Okay. Yes.
She's right here.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.600
That's Jillian.
- Yeah, no.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.067
Sorry about the stink,
though.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.500
It's my pits.
- Yes. They reek.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.933
- Yeah. They're really bad.
- Yeah.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.633
- Hot water's on the fritz,

11:45.633 --> 11:48.233
so I'm using the drinking
fountain to take whore's baths.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.733
- Whore's bath.
What are you doing?

11:50.733 --> 11:52.067
What are you doing to me?

11:52.067 --> 11:54.933
I'm just gonna do
the whole--yup.

11:54.933 --> 11:56.067
- What are you--oh.

11:56.067 --> 11:58.900
- And...
yeah.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.533
- Guys.

12:00.533 --> 12:01.767
Come out to the parking lot.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.533
The package is here.

12:03.533 --> 12:04.600
- What?
- Come on.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.733
- I didn't get a notification.

12:06.733 --> 12:07.867
- Package?

12:07.867 --> 12:10.200
[rock music]

12:10.200 --> 12:11.767
- [laughing] Well?

12:11.767 --> 12:13.233
- What's going on?
Where's the package?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.800
- What do you mean?
Right here.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.500
Newest member of the Beat-Ass
squad, The Total Package.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.633
- Oh, okay.
- Dude, you know what?

12:20.633 --> 12:22.833
One question.
Do you want me to bust on you?

12:22.833 --> 12:24.367
- No.
- I will bust on you!

12:24.367 --> 12:26.233
- Don't bust on me.
- Do not bust on him!

12:26.233 --> 12:27.467
- What is wrong with you?

12:27.467 --> 12:29.067
- Check it out.
Total Package.

12:29.067 --> 12:30.400
Explosives expert.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.867
Well, he's got a
little demonstration.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.167
- Don't say "explosive."
- All right.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.200
So I've laced
these roman candles

12:34.200 --> 12:36.367
with concentrated gun powder

12:36.367 --> 12:39.067
so they'll blow holes
in this dumpster.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.100
- Oh, come on, dude.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.300
- I love this.
- Stand back.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.733
- I would if I could see it.

12:42.733 --> 12:45.100
- Oh, yeah. There it is.
- Whoa, what are you--hey.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.733
- You ever blow a hole
in the dumpster?

12:46.733 --> 12:49.733
- Did it kill someone, dude?
Did you kill someone, dude?

12:49.733 --> 12:51.900
- Maybe I did the fuse wrong.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.600
- Is this, by any chance,
how you got your blade legs?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.200
- This guy has blade legs?

12:56.200 --> 12:59.133
- I lost my legs
in Afghanistan, bro.

12:59.133 --> 13:00.900
- That--yeah. Sorry. Cool.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.400
Thank you for your service.
- Yeah.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.633
Setting off fireworks
at a Kenny Chesney USO show.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.100
- Good for you.
- That's cool.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.567
[buzzing]
- Whoa.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.133
Phone's on vibrate.
- Answer it.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.567
Dude, we have a pact.
- Oh, get me there.

13:12.567 --> 13:14.067
- Stop. Will you--
- Ooh, get me there.

13:14.067 --> 13:15.300
Stop it! No, no!
- Oh, dude.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.733
You're hard in there.
- Yeah.

13:16.733 --> 13:18.633
Of course I am.
Give me that.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.267
The package is here.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.100
Oh, no.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.133
- That's awesome.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.067
Wait. Why "uh-oh"?

13:25.067 --> 13:26.733
- Guess who just signed for it?

13:26.733 --> 13:28.500
- Dude, what the heck?
That's not our tape.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.167
That's a TV.
- It's both.

13:30.167 --> 13:33.167
Actually, it's a TV/VCR
and the tape.

13:33.167 --> 13:34.233
The tape's stuck inside.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.167
It's a combo thing.

13:36.167 --> 13:37.500
- Oh, okay, okay.
Oh, no.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.367
No.
She's looking in the slot.

13:39.367 --> 13:40.900
- I wouldn't mind
looking in her slot.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.700
- We got to get it out of there
before she busts us.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.267
- Wait, what are you doing?

13:45.267 --> 13:47.133
[phone ringing]
What are you--

13:47.133 --> 13:48.800
- Alice Murphy.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.533
- [gruffly] I have had a bomb
delivered to your office.

13:51.533 --> 13:55.233
It's inside of a TV/VCR
from the '90s,

13:55.233 --> 13:57.067
and unless you get out now,

13:57.067 --> 13:59.633
you're gonna die, bitch!
- Oh, my God.

13:59.633 --> 14:00.733
Oh, my God, everyone!

14:00.733 --> 14:02.433
There's a bomb in the office!

14:02.433 --> 14:03.933
Everyone get into
the parking lot now!

14:03.933 --> 14:05.933
- Go! Everyone go!
- That doesn't make sense.

14:05.933 --> 14:08.233
Why would anyone--bomb?

14:08.233 --> 14:10.067
- No, no, no, no.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.633
She locked it.

14:12.633 --> 14:15.267
- Hey, remember that slot joke
I just said?

14:15.267 --> 14:18.167
I feel like my comedy senses
are, like, heightened.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.067
- Way to go, Blake,
once again.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.233
And by the way, these aren't
tears coming out of my eyes.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.067
This is ejack bubbling out.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.533
- You know, we could've been
on our way to Crank Down Town,

14:34.533 --> 14:37.400
that city,
but you freaking screwed us.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.133
- I--what are you talking about?

14:39.133 --> 14:41.600
I didn't--I'm not the one
who called in a bomb threat.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.267
- Careful.
Careful, careful.

14:43.267 --> 14:44.900
You want the red wire,
not the blue wire.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.267
- Shut the hell up.
I know what I'm doing.

14:47.267 --> 14:49.400
- Oh, really?
You know what you're doing?

14:49.400 --> 14:51.900
Tell that to Jake's son.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.333
- How dare you.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.933
Don't you ever bring up Jake.

14:55.933 --> 14:57.800
- Look, guys, I just want to say

14:57.800 --> 15:00.600
I'm sorry for dragging us
away from the package.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.467
I actually feel
very, very bad about this.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.067
- Well, you should feel
bad about it.

15:04.067 --> 15:05.267
"Superbad" the movie
bad about it.

15:05.267 --> 15:06.433
- I do.
- It's okay, bud.

15:06.433 --> 15:07.567
- Thank you.
- All is forgiven.

15:07.567 --> 15:08.767
Get in here.
- Thank you.

15:08.767 --> 15:10.500
I love you so much.
- All right.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.833
I'm just saying it's
really, really hard

15:12.833 --> 15:14.733
to grow up without a dad,

15:14.733 --> 15:16.333
especially in Rancho.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.833
- Okay.
I wasn't gonna do this,

15:17.833 --> 15:20.367
but you're really
pushing my buttons.

15:20.367 --> 15:21.833
Jake has a dad.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.867
Tina did a DNA test.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.800
It's you.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.067
- I have a son?

15:29.067 --> 15:31.733
[laughing]
I have a son.

15:31.733 --> 15:33.067
I have a son!

15:33.067 --> 15:34.533
- If you guys
would just give the dudes

15:34.533 --> 15:35.933
a chance, you'd like 'em.

15:35.933 --> 15:37.767
They're actually
really, really cool dudes.

15:37.767 --> 15:40.867
- They're actually
really, really not.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.933
[all speaking at once]
- It's the tape.

15:42.933 --> 15:45.067
- They've got the tape.
- Act like we didn't do it.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.433
- Yeah, right. Yeah.

15:46.433 --> 15:47.867
- False alarm, everyone.

15:47.867 --> 15:49.733
It was just a porno tape.
- Oh.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.567
- It's "The Nutting Professor."

15:51.567 --> 15:55.233
It's Dan Yella.
He busts mad loads.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.700
- A porno tape?

15:56.700 --> 15:59.167
I wonder who would be
dumb enough to send

15:59.167 --> 16:00.767
this to the office.
- Well, we all--

16:00.767 --> 16:03.200
- Well, whoever it is,
they better fess up right now

16:03.200 --> 16:05.333
or everyone
is working this weekend.

16:05.333 --> 16:08.067
Who's tape is this?

16:08.067 --> 16:09.733
- It's mine, sorry.

16:09.733 --> 16:13.600
I think my package got delivered
to your office by mistake.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.400
- Then, who called
in the bomb threat?

16:16.400 --> 16:17.600
- Bomb threat?

16:20.267 --> 16:21.533
- Hey! Hey!
- He just took the tape.

16:21.533 --> 16:22.833
[all speaking at once]
- Okay.

16:22.833 --> 16:23.833
Everyone back inside.

16:23.833 --> 16:24.733
Let's go now.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.300
- Let's go. Everybody.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.967
- Dude, this is the perfect
chance to unleash Beat-Ass.

16:27.967 --> 16:29.767
- No, no.
You're not unleashing Beat-Ass,

16:29.767 --> 16:31.433
okay, 'cause they've ruined
everything so far.

16:31.433 --> 16:32.767
We're out. Ready?
- Yup. I'm with you.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.067
I'm with Ders. Let's roll.
- Okay.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.333
Let's go.
- This way.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.667
[rock music]

16:36.667 --> 16:38.167
Come on!
- I'm coming!

16:38.167 --> 16:40.067
*

16:40.067 --> 16:43.567
- Oh, no.
He's getting into a minivan.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.667
The license plate
said "MRNULEAF."

16:45.667 --> 16:46.867
To the 'Vo.
- All right.

16:46.867 --> 16:47.967
both: To the 'Vo!

16:50.067 --> 16:52.467
- We can head him off if we just
go down this alley right here.

16:52.467 --> 16:54.100
- What? What alley?
There's no alley.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.400
We're in the Hills, dude.
What are you talking about?

16:55.400 --> 16:56.467
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.567
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

16:58.567 --> 17:00.233
These bumps are gonna
make me bust!

17:00.233 --> 17:01.767
- No.
- Yeah.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.233
- Here, I'll turn on some music
to distract you.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.600
- Okay.

17:04.600 --> 17:05.867
- * That's what's going on *

17:05.867 --> 17:07.600
- Oh, damn.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.900
- * Nothing's fine, I'm torn *
- No!

17:08.900 --> 17:11.067
- * I'm all out of faith *

17:11.067 --> 17:13.300
* This is how I feel

17:13.300 --> 17:15.333
* I'm cold and I am shamed *

17:15.333 --> 17:18.433
* Lying naked on the floor

17:18.433 --> 17:20.767
* Illusion never changed

17:23.233 --> 17:27.833
- Oh, I ruined my best khakis.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.700
Damn it.
He's going for the freeway.

17:33.267 --> 17:35.500
- Somebody call
for a superhero squad?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.167
- Dude, you're too late,
all right?

17:37.167 --> 17:39.267
You and the weirdos aren't gonna
beat that guy up the ramp.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.267
[dramatic music]

17:42.267 --> 17:44.267
*

17:44.267 --> 17:46.233
- That's where you're wrong.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.533
Total Package, I'm gonna
need your blade legs.

17:48.533 --> 17:51.167
Dr. Heals-Good, let me
borrow Chester for a second.

17:51.167 --> 17:52.933
Thanks, bro.

17:52.933 --> 17:53.867
Awesome.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.867
- Whoa.
Buy me dinner first!

17:57.867 --> 17:59.067
- What?

17:59.067 --> 18:07.067
*

18:13.900 --> 18:15.067
- [shouts]

18:15.067 --> 18:19.100
*

18:19.100 --> 18:21.267
[tires screech]

18:21.267 --> 18:22.900
- Oh, my God.

18:22.900 --> 18:23.833
Was that a baby?

18:23.833 --> 18:25.600
- That is a ventriloquist dummy

18:25.600 --> 18:27.533
that I threw at your vehicle
to stop you.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.167
- Why would you do that?

18:29.167 --> 18:31.200
- Because you took something
that belongs to my friends

18:31.200 --> 18:33.067
and me.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.800
- Chester!

18:35.800 --> 18:38.367
[sloshing]

18:38.367 --> 18:40.700
- Sorry about that, man.
I hope it didn't cost too much.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.833
- All right.
Hand it over, NULEAF.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.200
That's right.
We know it's you.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.867
- Come on.
Why would you want it so bad?

18:47.867 --> 18:48.667
- Wait a second.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.367
I know that voice.

18:50.367 --> 18:51.733
That's Dan Yella!

18:51.733 --> 18:53.600
- Take off your sunglasses
and hat.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.667
[laughter]
- Right?

18:58.667 --> 19:00.067
- Pornographic memory.
I just--

19:00.067 --> 19:01.067
- Yeah. Yeah, no.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.600
It's totally him,

19:02.600 --> 19:04.833
but he's got, like, a bunch
of old man makeup on and a wig.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.700
- This isn't makeup or a wig.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.867
I'm just older,
and I grew my hair out.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.567
I'm a normal guy now.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.967
I made one stupid film, and now
I've spent all these years

19:12.967 --> 19:16.400
trying to get every last copy
of it back off the Internet.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.900
- Why would you want to destroy
something so beautiful?

19:18.900 --> 19:20.567
- Because he's about to be
a father.

19:20.567 --> 19:22.167
- He's already a father,
okay?

19:22.167 --> 19:24.133
He's our porn daddy.
- He taught me how to bone.

19:24.133 --> 19:26.300
- Honestly,
it would mean the world to us

19:26.300 --> 19:30.067
if we could watch you bone
one last time, Mr. Yella.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.433
- Yeah.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.633
- Okay.

19:33.633 --> 19:35.967
Maybe we could do
a one-time only

19:35.967 --> 19:38.833
private sex show
between my wife and I,

19:38.833 --> 19:40.967
but then I get
to keep the tape.

19:40.967 --> 19:43.800
- What? Dan.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.267
- Brenda, come on.
Look at these losers.

19:46.267 --> 19:47.633
It's all they have.

19:49.533 --> 19:50.900
- Yeah. We should do it.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.167
- Yes!
- Thank you!

19:52.167 --> 19:54.800
[all exclaiming]

19:54.800 --> 19:56.467
- Can't wait to see it.

19:56.467 --> 19:57.833
- Yeah.
- Is it still bent?

19:57.833 --> 19:59.133
Is it still,
like, a little bent?

20:06.333 --> 20:10.567
[rustling]

20:10.567 --> 20:12.367
- Have they started yet?

20:12.367 --> 20:14.600
I wish I could see.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.333
[sighs]

20:16.333 --> 20:17.767
I'm gonna go get my lube.

20:17.767 --> 20:19.267
- All right. Yeah.
Cool.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.600
- I'm okay.

20:25.067 --> 20:26.367
Okay, yeah, no.

20:26.367 --> 20:28.467
I am so not into this.
- Yeah.

20:28.467 --> 20:33.033
I--pretty much empty down there
after the whole you-know-what.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.400
- Yeah.
Let's get out of here.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.000
- Thanks, though, seriously.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.500
You're a trooper.
- All right.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.100
Suit yourselves, guys.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.700
Okay, Honey.
Let's lose the tops.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.900
- All right.
Got my lube.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.567
Okay.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.033
All right.

20:50.033 --> 20:52.500
Here we go.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.167
Dan Yella. This is cool.

20:54.167 --> 20:57.367
This is fun. It's like a dream
come true, honestly.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.067
All right. Mmm.

20:59.067 --> 21:00.633
Potent smell.

21:00.633 --> 21:02.200
Smells like sandwiches.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.333
- Nice.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.400
- What's the package?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.067
- God, I just want to jack off
so bad.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.900
- Guys, wait up.
- Hey, guys. What's the package?

21:12.900 --> 21:16.567
- Ugh! Oh, you were lucky
I'm in a hurry, Waymond,

21:16.567 --> 21:17.933
or I would wreck you!

21:17.933 --> 21:19.200
Little bitch.
