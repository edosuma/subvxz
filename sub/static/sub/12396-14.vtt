WEBVTT

00:12.210 --> 00:14.030
- HI. I'M FELICIA.

00:14.140 --> 00:17.007
- OH. HI, FELICIA.
I'M HENRY.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.044
- WANNA RUN TOGETHER?

00:19.150 --> 00:21.072
- ONLY IF YOU CAN KEEP UP.

00:21.180 --> 00:24.445
- RUNNERS, ON YOUR MARKS,

00:24.550 --> 00:26.051
GET SET,

00:26.160 --> 00:27.787
GO!
[gunshot]

00:27.890 --> 00:29.289
- WHAT?

00:29.390 --> 00:34.054
[cheers and applause]

00:36.100 --> 00:37.692
[tires screeching]

00:42.870 --> 00:45.065
HI. HEY!

00:54.550 --> 00:55.676
- WHAT THE--

00:55.780 --> 01:00.114
[tires screeching]

01:00.220 --> 01:01.414
-AAH!

01:01.520 --> 01:04.318
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

01:04.430 --> 01:05.829
OH!
- GOSH!

01:05.930 --> 01:08.649
[crowd chattering]

01:11.400 --> 01:12.799
- AAH!
- WHAT?

01:12.900 --> 01:14.128
- DON'T HIT ANY HUMANS!
- I GOT IT, SHAWN.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.606
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.439
[horn honking]

01:18.540 --> 01:19.768
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

01:19.880 --> 01:21.199
I'M A PSYCHIC, DAMN IT!

01:21.310 --> 01:23.073
- YOU DO A LOT
OF THESE THINGS?

01:23.180 --> 01:25.478
- BEHIND YOU!
- OH, NO. LOOK OUT!

01:25.580 --> 01:28.242
- WHAT KIND OF IDIOT
DRIVES DOWN A PUBLIC PATHWAY?

01:28.350 --> 01:30.113
[horn honks]

01:30.220 --> 01:32.154
- OH, THAT'S MY DAD.
- WHAT?

01:32.260 --> 01:32.851
- HEY, DAD!

01:32.960 --> 01:34.848
- SHAWN!

01:34.960 --> 01:37.849
[tires screeching, siren wails]

01:37.960 --> 01:40.451
- WE ARE GONNA CATCH THIS
SON OF A BITCH OR DIE TRYING.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.537
- [gaSPSJ

01:46.640 --> 01:48.392
- OH! JEEZ!

01:48.500 --> 01:50.263
- OH, CRAP!

01:50.370 --> 01:53.305
[all screaming]

01:56.750 --> 01:59.275
- [coughs]

01:59.380 --> 02:02.213
- HECK OF A WAY TO START
A HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.880
- CRIME FIGHTING
ISN'T ALWAYS TIDY, CHIEF.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.651
THAT IS THE BARGAIN
THE CITIZENS MAKE

02:06.760 --> 02:07.715
IN EXCHANGE
FOR THEIR PROTECTION,

02:07.820 --> 02:09.151
AND THEY'RE FINE WITH IT.

02:09.260 --> 02:10.488
- WELL, NOT ACCORDING
TO THE COMPLAINTS.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.126
THEY'RE CALLING
FOR OUR HEADS.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.891
- WHO IS?
- BUT I'M TALKING TO YOU.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.353
WILL YOU LOOK--
LOOK AT ME!

02:15.460 --> 02:17.325
NO, I WILL NOT
WAIT HERE IN THE LOBBY.

02:17.430 --> 02:18.829
WHAT THE HELL KIND
OF MICKEY MOUSE OPERATION

02:18.930 --> 02:20.795
ARE YOU RUNNING AROUND HERE?
KAREN!

02:20.900 --> 02:22.367
- OH, IT'S--

02:23.540 --> 02:25.633
SO OUR NEW MAYOR HAS PUT
EVERY CITY AGENCY ON A HOT SEAT.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.139
AND AFTER TODAY'S DEBACLE,

02:27.240 --> 02:30.277
OUR BUTTS JUST GOT
A WHOLE LOT WARMER.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.642
- HM.

02:31.750 --> 02:32.876
- SO THE MAYOR'S DECIDED
TO SEND OVER

02:32.980 --> 02:35.619
A CONSULTANT
TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.142
- YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.444
- WHO IS THIS CONSULTANT?

02:38.550 --> 02:39.915
- MR. HARRIS TROUT.

02:40.020 --> 02:41.453
- WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT?

02:41.560 --> 02:42.788
- LOOK, JUST BE WARNED.

02:42.890 --> 02:45.154
THIS IS ONE
MANIPULATIVE S.O.B.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.820
HE'S THE KIND THAT'LL
USE SILENCE AS A TACTIC.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.228
- UGH. SILENCES
MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

02:50.330 --> 02:51.467
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, GUS.

02:51.570 --> 02:54.368
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE JUST--

02:54.470 --> 02:56.404
- DON'T DO THAT, SHAWN.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.933
- WHO THE HELL IS THIS TROUT
TO TELL ME HOW TO DO MY JOB?

02:59.040 --> 03:02.248
- I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHO I AM.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.440
I WAS A POLICE CHIEF IN BOTH
BALTIMORE AND PHILADELPHIA.

03:10.550 --> 03:11.915
BEFORE THAT,
I SERVED AS AN OFFICER

03:12.020 --> 03:13.908
IN THE CITY OF NEWARK,
EVENTUALLY RISING

03:14.020 --> 03:17.751
TO THE RANK
OF EXECUTIVE SUPERINTENDENT.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.420
I'M ALSO A CONSULTANT ON A SHOW
CALLED "BADGE AND HONOR."

03:20.530 --> 03:22.589
AND I WON AN EMMY
FOR MY EPISODE

03:22.700 --> 03:24.190
CALLED "MY HYMIE'S HOMIE."

03:24.300 --> 03:26.393
NOW ONE OF THOSE THINGS
IS ACTUALLY UNTRUE,

03:26.500 --> 03:29.708
BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT
YOU'LL FIGURE OUT WHICH.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.677
- MR. TROUT,
IT'S AN HONOR.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.674
- PUT IT THERE.

03:44.890 --> 03:48.257
- SO IS TROUT
A FAMILY NAME OR--

03:51.030 --> 03:54.818
UM, I HAD WAFFLES
FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.

03:58.870 --> 04:02.306
WANNA HEAR MY SHOULDER CLICK?

04:02.410 --> 04:03.900
[shoulder clicking]

04:04.010 --> 04:07.673
- LET'S BEGIN, LADIES.
LET'S BEGIN.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.868
- MM.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.878
- OKAY.
HERE'S THE BAD NEWS.

04:15.980 --> 04:16.947
YOU'RE FIRED.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.642
all: WHAT?

04:18.750 --> 04:19.853
- HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.655
YOU HAVE THE CHANCE NOW
TO TELL ME

04:21.760 --> 04:22.852
WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.450
I INTEND
TO SAVE THE TAXPAYERS

04:24.560 --> 04:25.879
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
BY TRIMMING THE WORKFORCE

04:25.990 --> 04:29.323
INTO A NEW MODEL OF PRECISION
AND EFFICIENCY.

04:29.430 --> 04:30.624
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
HIRE A BUNCH OF ROBOTS?

04:30.730 --> 04:32.288
- TRUST ME, I WOULD'VE,

04:32.400 --> 04:33.936
HAD THE PROTOTYPE I HELPED
DESIGN NOT MALFUNCTIONED.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.304
THE HARRIS-X50 STRANGLED
ONE JAYWALKER,

04:36.410 --> 04:37.763
AND NOW IT'S DOING
TOUR BUSSES.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.337
- I DON'T KNOW, MR. TROUT.
SEEMS TO ME

04:39.440 --> 04:40.930
THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S
IN PRETI'Y GOOD SHAPE.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.678
I MEAN, OVER THE LAST
SEVEN YEARS WE'VE SOLVED

04:42.780 --> 04:44.839
SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF WHAT,

04:44.950 --> 04:47.271
A HUNDRED HOMICIDES?
[chuckles]

04:47.380 --> 04:48.847
- WOW.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.508
WELL, THE FACT THAT
SANTA BARBARA IS MURDER CENTRAL

04:50.620 --> 04:52.315
SUGGESTS A MAJOR LACK
OF DETERRENT.

04:52.420 --> 04:53.887
ALL RIGHT?
NOW WE'RE LISTENING.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.356
OKAY, GOOD.
IN TRUTH, YOU'RE KIND OF A JOKE.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.985
- PEOPLE LOVE TO LAUGH
AND BE HELD DOWN AND TICKLED.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.921
- SO YOU MUST BE
THE PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.395
- SHAWN SPENCER.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.865
THIS IS MY PARTNER
BURTON TROUT.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.369
- NO RELATION.

05:05.470 --> 05:07.062
- I DON'T BELIEVE
IN PSYCHICS.

05:07.170 --> 05:08.933
- WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU
WE'RE VERY REAL,

05:09.040 --> 05:11.065
NOT UNLIKE THE YETI
AND ALL OF HIS PLAY FRIENDS.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.637
- MM, PROVE YOURSELF TO ME.

05:12.740 --> 05:13.968
COME ON, READ ME.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.570
- OH, IT DOESN'T--
- [chuckles]

05:15.680 --> 05:17.898
- IT DOESN'T QUITE
WORK LIKE THAT, MR. TROUT.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.718
BUT I GUESS IN YOUR CASE
I CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.026
[clears throat]

05:31.130 --> 05:33.519
I AM SENSING THAT
YOU ARE APPROXIMATELY 41--

05:33.630 --> 05:35.723
NAY, 42 YEARS OLD.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.969
YOU ARE A GERMAPHOBE,
AN OBSESSIVE HAND WASHER

05:38.070 --> 05:39.389
AND HAND WRANGLER.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.831
YOU'RE A BIG FAN
OF THE DYSON AIRBLADE

05:40.870 --> 05:41.029
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT MAKES YOU
FEEL IN OTHER PLACES.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.409
YOU HAIL FROM BUFFALO.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.034
YOUR FAVORITE SPORT
IS BASKETBALL.

05:46.140 --> 05:48.438
AND YOU HAD A GOLDEN RETRIEVER
NAMED BUDDY,

05:48.540 --> 05:49.768
THAT WAS A VERY LONELY BOY'S

05:49.880 --> 05:51.643
ONLY FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.469
HOW DOES THAT SMELL?
LIKE BACON?

05:54.580 --> 05:57.083
DO YOU BELIEVE IN PSYCHICS
NOW, MR. TROUTMAN?

05:59.050 --> 06:02.053
- NO. IN FACT, EVEN LESS
THAN I DID TWO MINUTES AGO.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.980
BUFFALO AND
THE HAND WASHING THING

06:04.090 --> 06:05.580
COULD HAVE BEEN DERIVED
THROUGH OBSERVATION.

06:05.690 --> 06:06.952
BUT I GOT NO IDEA
WHERE YOU GOT THE BASKETBALL

06:07.060 --> 06:08.357
OR THE GOLDEN RETRIEVER THING.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.927
- HE WATCHED AIR BUD
LAST NIGHT.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.691
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY

06:11.800 --> 06:13.438
ON THAT DVD IS ABSURD.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.861
ALL HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT
IS MOTIF THIS AND SUBTEXT THAT.

06:15.970 --> 06:20.373
AND THE DOG IS...
[barking]

06:20.480 --> 06:21.936
NO MATTER WHAT
THE QUESTION IS.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.008
- DUDE.
- OKAY.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.145
WALK ME THROUGH
TODAY'S FIASCO

06:25.250 --> 06:28.970
AND LEAVE NOTHING OUT.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.082
[timer clicking]
- OKAY.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.011
GUESS IT STARTED OFF
LIKE ANY OTHER

06:34.120 --> 06:35.519
RUN-OF-THE-MILL CASE.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.383
GUS AND I WERE
IN THE PSYCH OFFICE

06:37.490 --> 06:38.957
REVIEWING OLD FILES.

06:39.060 --> 06:41.893
[both grunting]

06:42.000 --> 06:43.820
I'M CLEARLY WINNING.
- DON'T COUNT ME OUT.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.158
DON'T COUNT ME OUT.
- I'M FADING.

06:45.270 --> 06:46.931
GUY WALKS IN--

06:47.040 --> 06:48.462
I'M FADING LIKE A FLOWER.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.106
VERY SWEATY,
BREATHING HEAW,

06:50.210 --> 06:51.632
QUITE DISGUSTING.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.538
- I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
FIND A MURDERER.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.834
WHOSE MURDERER?

06:55.880 --> 06:56.039
- MINE.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.039
- WOW.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.516
I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS
A RUN-OF-THE-MILL CASE.

07:03.620 --> 07:07.909
- WELCOME TO SANTA BARBARA,
MR. TROUT.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.921
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

07:11.030 --> 07:14.921
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT
I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

07:15.030 --> 07:18.522
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY
JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

07:18.630 --> 07:19.597
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

07:19.700 --> 07:21.565
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

07:21.670 --> 07:23.604
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

07:23.710 --> 07:25.905
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

07:26.010 --> 07:28.604
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:31.310 --> 07:32.208
- SO A DISGUSTING
SWEATY MAN ASKS YOU

07:32.310 --> 07:33.538
TO FIND HIS MURDERER?

07:33.650 --> 07:34.742
- THAT'S CORRECT.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.579
- OH, NO, PLEASE CONTINUE,
PSYCHIC.

07:36.690 --> 07:40.012
- OKAY, UH, HE SAID
THAT HIS NAME WAS LEO QUINN

07:40.120 --> 07:41.189
AND THAT HE
HAD BEEN POISONED.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.757
- MY NAME IS LEO QUINN

07:42.860 --> 07:43.952
AND I'VE BEEN POISONED.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.755
- OOH.
- POISONED?

07:45.860 --> 07:47.191
[laughs]

07:47.300 --> 07:48.949
GUS HERE THINKS HE GETS POISONED
TEN TIMES A YEAR.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.459
IT'S NEVER ONCE BEEN TRUE.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.889
- NOT YET.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.638
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:53.740 --> 07:54.866
MAN, FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
THIS GUY

07:54.900 --> 07:55.059
LOOKS LIKE THIS EVERY DAY.

07:56.910 --> 07:57.069
- HEY, I-I KNOW
I'M NO ADONIS,

07:58.940 --> 08:01.534
BUT TEN HOURS AGO,
I'M A NORMAL, HEALTHY MAN.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.677
NOW LOOK AT ME.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.077
- IT'S NOT GREAT.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.670
- WHEN I STARTED TO FEEL SICK,

08:07.780 --> 08:09.247
I WENT TO THE E.R.
AND GOT A BLOOD TEST.

08:09.350 --> 08:12.239
THE DOCTOR JUST CALLED.
IT'S POISON.

08:12.350 --> 08:13.851
- MMM.

08:13.960 --> 08:14.949
- THE DOCTOR SAID THAT?

08:15.060 --> 08:17.949
- [coughs]

08:18.060 --> 08:20.949
NATURALLY, GUS AND I WANTED
TO CONFIRM THIS,

08:21.060 --> 08:22.618
SO WE TOOK HIM BACK
TO THE E.R.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.198
- HE'S BEEN EXPOSED
TO SODIUM MONOFLOROACETATE,

08:25.300 --> 08:26.961
OR COMPOUND 1080.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.264
IT'S A HIGHLY TOXIC POISON

08:28.370 --> 08:30.565
USED FOR LARGE SCALE
PEST CONTROL.

08:30.670 --> 08:31.967
- DO YOU BELIEVE ME NOW?

08:32.070 --> 08:33.276
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

08:33.380 --> 08:35.268
DOCTOR, I THINK
I NEED TO BE ADMI'I'I'ED.

08:35.380 --> 08:36.642
- IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.047
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE?

08:38.150 --> 08:40.015
- LOOK, DOC, HOW DO YOU THINK
HE GOT IT?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.681
- WELL, MAYBE HE INGESTED IT
OR HAD SKIN CONTACT.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.189
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
SOMETHING HE'D BE EXPOSED TO

08:45.290 --> 08:46.609
IN THE NORMAL COURSE
OF THINGS.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.709
AH.
- AH.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.055
- UNLESS SOMEONE
GAVE IT TO HIM INTENTIONALLY.

08:50.090 --> 08:50.988
- OH, GOD.
- SO WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

08:51.830 --> 08:52.524
DO YOU GUYS HAVE
THE ANTIDOTE HERE?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.019
DO I GET MEDEVAC SOMEWHERE?

08:54.130 --> 08:56.667
- [softly stammering]

08:56.770 --> 08:58.522
- WHAT--WHAT ARE MY CHANCES?

08:58.630 --> 08:59.995
- WHAT ARE OUR CHANCES,
DOCTOR?

09:00.100 --> 09:03.103
- IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.859
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO HELP YOU,

09:04.910 --> 09:05.069
BUT I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYONE SURVIVE

09:07.140 --> 09:08.698
THIS LEVEL OF TOXICITY.

09:08.810 --> 09:11.779
AND MOST PEOPLE SUCCUMB
WITHIN 48 HOURS.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.077
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

09:15.180 --> 09:18.718
SO I REALLY AM A DEAD MAN?

09:18.820 --> 09:19.787
- [whimpers]

09:19.890 --> 09:20.982
- YOU SHOULD DO
WHATEVER YOU CAN

09:21.090 --> 09:22.728
TO GET YOUR AFFAIRS
IN ORDER.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.650
I'M SORRY.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.991
- MM.
WELL, THAT'S DRAMATIC.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.062
ANYBODY EATING
THESE DONUTS?

09:31.170 --> 09:33.331
- OH, YES.
- I'LL SPLIT ONE WITH SOMEONE.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.567
- EVERY LAST ONE.
- OKAY.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.860
[both gasp]

09:38.910 --> 09:39.069
OKAY, NEXT.

09:41.340 --> 09:42.739
I GUESS IT'S FAIR
FOR ME TO ASSUME

09:42.850 --> 09:44.169
THAT YOU DID NOT
FOLLOW PROCEDURE

09:44.280 --> 09:46.271
AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACT
THE DEPARTMENT THOUGH, RIGHT?

09:46.380 --> 09:48.575
- THAT IS WHERE
YOU WOULD BE WRONG, MR. TROUT.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.784
THE FIRST CALL I MADE
WAS TO THE DEPARTMENT.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.949
SORRY, SWEETIE,
I HAVE TO WHISPER BECAUSE

09:53.060 --> 09:56.211
I'M STANDING NEAR A GUY
WHO'S GONNA BE DEAD VERY SOON.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.720
O-OKAY, I WILL.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.195
SMOOCHY, SMOOCH--

10:00.300 --> 10:01.824
NO, YOU SMOOCHY,
SMOOCHY.

10:01.930 --> 10:04.023
NO, SMOOCHY TO YOU.

10:07.070 --> 10:09.368
- NO, I MEANT A CALL TO REPORT
THE ALLEGED MURDER.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.700
- OH. NO.
NO, WE DIDN'T DO THAT.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.937
- THOUGH IN OUR DEFENSE,
I MUST SAY

10:14.040 --> 10:15.701
WHEN ONE IS FACING
THEIR OWN MORTALITY,

10:15.810 --> 10:18.278
YOU DO TEND TO WANT
TO CONNECT WITH LOVED ONES.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.880
PERSONALLY, I'M IN BETWEEN
RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT NOW.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.079
DATING CAN BE TOUGH.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANNA SETTLE.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.754
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES BEING ALONE
IS A GOOD THING.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.784
AND OTHER TIMES, Y-YOU KNOW,
THE TOUCH OF A WOMAN IS--

10:31.890 --> 10:33.892
- GUS.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.956
- SO YOU TWO ARE AN ITEM?

10:36.060 --> 10:38.096
- FOR THE RECORD, I ALWAYS
THOUGHT IT WAS UNPROFESSIONAL.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.269
- OH, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

10:39.370 --> 10:40.735
YOU MARRIED A FELON

10:40.840 --> 10:42.068
YOU HELPED PUT IN JAIL.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.364
- SHE'S A REHABILITATED FELON!

10:43.470 --> 10:45.233
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WORKS.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.308
- WAIT, COULD WE JUST PLEASE
STICK TO THE POINT?

10:47.410 --> 10:50.277
- AT LEAST I'M NOT A PART-TIME
STRIPPER LIKE MCNAB.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.348
- MCNAB'S A STRIPPER?
- OH, YOU WERE SO HAMMERED

10:52.450 --> 10:54.042
AT THE BACHELORETTE PARTY,
YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER.

10:54.150 --> 10:55.219
- OKAY, ENOUGH.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.379
UH, MR. SPENCER, PLEASE.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.912
- BUH-BUH-BUH-BUH,
ONE SEC HERE.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.282
YOU GUYS ARE PRACTICALLY

11:00.390 --> 11:02.085
WRITING MY NEXT EPISODE
OF "BADGE."

11:02.190 --> 11:03.680
GOOD STUFF HERE.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.724
WELL, THIS IS A CRACK UNIT
YOU GOT HERE.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.024
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD
OF THEM,

11:07.130 --> 11:09.997
VERY PROUD OF THEM.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.795
NO, PLEASE CONTINUE HERE,
PLEASE.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.891
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.035
LEO WAS VERY UPSET.

11:15.140 --> 11:16.289
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DEAD.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.958
THERE'S SO MUCH
I HAVEN'T DONE.

11:18.070 --> 11:19.139
I WAS GONNA LEARN MANDARIN.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.377
I WAS GONNA START YOGA.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.038
I WAS GONNA UPGRADE TO MAC,

11:22.140 --> 11:23.698
BECAUSE ALL THE COMPUTERS
IN MY OFFICE--

11:23.810 --> 11:26.108
- LEO, I THINK YOU'RE
SPIRALING A LITTLE BIT.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.815
- YEAH, I'M ENTITLED.
- LEO, THINK.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.888
DID ANYONE HAVE IT OUT FOR YOU,
WANT YOU DEAD?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.139
- I'M A SMALL-TIME LAWYER.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.808
I MOSTLY WORK PRO BONO.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.114
I'M ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.051
PEOPLE LIKE ME.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.184
NO, THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

11:38.290 --> 11:39.894
'CAUSE I'M FINE.
- COME.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.025
- I FEEL FINE.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.859
- HE'S EXPERIENCING DENIAL.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.291
IT'S ONE OF THE FIVE STAGES
OF GRIEF.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.095
- FIVE? WOW, YOU THINK
HE HAS TIME FOR ALL THOSE?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.134
I MEAN, MAYBE HE SHOULD
JUST PICK TWO.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.060
- YOU CAN'T CHOOSE.
- RITA!

11:52.170 --> 11:53.706
WHAT AM I GONNA
TELL MY WIFE?

11:53.810 --> 11:54.936
SHE'S ON A FLIGHT

11:55.040 --> 11:56.302
FROM VISITING HER MOM
IN MEXICO CITY.

11:56.410 --> 11:57.707
I HAVE TO PICK HER UP
AT THE AIRPORT.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.300
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
- LEO, COME ON.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.071
- YOU'RE IN NO SHAPE FOR THAT.
- THE HELL I'M NOT!

12:01.180 --> 12:02.943
I HAVE TO TELL HER
IN PERSON.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.779
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON'T TOUCH ME!

12:04.890 --> 12:06.118
- [groans]
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.415
YOU SAW HIM REACH OUT.
- HE'S POISONED, SHAWN.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.056
- HE IS NOT CONTAGIOUS!

12:10.160 --> 12:11.354
LET'S GET HIM UP.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.859
- HE'S NOT CONTAGIOUS.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.097
- I'M NOT TRYING TO DIE.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.929
- WE TOLD HIM
THAT WE WOULD PICK UP RITA.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.021
AND WHEN WE ASKED HIM
WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE,

12:18.130 --> 12:20.189
HE SAID, "YOU JUST
GO LOOK FOR AN ANGEL."

12:20.300 --> 12:22.268
SAFE TO SAY
THAT ANGEL IS A RELATIVE TERM.

12:22.370 --> 12:25.032
JUST LOOK
FOR A FEMALE VERSION OF LEO

12:25.140 --> 12:27.074
AND WE'LL BE
IN THE BALLPARK.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.909
UH, RITA QUINN?

12:28.940 --> 12:29.099
YOU SURE?

12:30.850 --> 12:31.908
THERE'S NO SHAME IN IT.

12:31.950 --> 12:32.109
- RITA QUINN?

12:34.550 --> 12:36.882
- I WOULDA LOST MONEY
ON THAT.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.412
AH, GUS, SHE'S PERFECT.
- WHO?

12:38.520 --> 12:39.953
- RIGHT THERE.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.880
- THAT'S A DUDE, SHAWN.
- NO.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.981
THAT'S DREYFUSS FROM JAWS.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.352
- I'M RITA QUINN.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.291
- UH, NOT THE RITA QUINN
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.356
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A LEO QUINN'S WIFE.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.269
- I'M LEO QUINN'S WIFE.

12:51.370 --> 12:54.066
- EXCUSE ME.
- JUST A MOMENT.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.263
- NO WAY, NOT EVEN
ON A GOOD HAIR DAY

12:56.370 --> 12:58.235
AND HE'S NOT SICK,
DOES LEO PULL THAT.

12:58.340 --> 12:59.932
- LOVE IS BLIND, SHAWN.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.507
- BUT SHE ISN'T.

13:01.610 --> 13:03.248
- NO, SHE'S NOT.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.942
- WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS PART?

13:05.050 --> 13:06.870
- I AM SIMPLY ATTEMPTING
TO HIGHLIGHT

13:06.980 --> 13:08.777
OUR PROCESS FOR YOU, SIR.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.486
RITA ASKED US WHO WE WERE
AND WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS.

13:12.590 --> 13:13.989
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

13:14.090 --> 13:15.955
THIS IS MY PARTNER
"BAD NEWS" MARVIN BARNES.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.880
- I HAVE BAD NEWS.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.184
LEO'S BEEN POISONED.

13:19.290 --> 13:20.894
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.265
HE PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.032
- FEEL FREE TO EMOTE NOW.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.960
- I'M--I'M SHOCKED.

13:29.070 --> 13:32.062
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.979
- MAYBE YOU WANNA
GO SEE HIM?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.036
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
COMFORT HIM.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.869
- OF COURSE.
YES, WE'LL GO SEE HIM.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.470
LET'S GO SEE HIM.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.946
- SO WE TOOK RITA
TO SEE LEO.

13:42.050 --> 13:43.915
- OH.

13:45.990 --> 13:50.950
- DUDE, THERE WERE
NO AIRLINE TAGS ON HER BAG.

13:51.060 --> 13:53.927
- [crying]

13:54.960 --> 13:56.825
- OH, GOD.

13:56.930 --> 13:57.919
- AND, DUDE--
- YEAH.

13:57.970 --> 13:58.129
- YEAH.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.363
OBVIOUSLY I WAS SKEPTICAL

14:02.470 --> 14:04.062
OF THE STUPIDLY HOT LATINA

14:04.170 --> 14:06.035
MARRIED TO
THE TRAVELOCITY GNOME.

14:06.140 --> 14:10.042
I WAS ALSO SENSING PAPERS,
NON-U.S. ISSUE.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.347
CERTIFICADO DEL BIRTH.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.941
AND A NAME, VASQUEZ.

14:16.050 --> 14:17.984
[Spanish accent]
RITA, SOMEDAY YOU WILL

14:18.090 --> 14:21.981
GO TO THE AMERICAS
AND MARRY A WHITE MAN.

14:22.090 --> 14:23.887
- SEE, RITA VASQUEZ--

14:23.990 --> 14:25.082
- MARRIED LEO QUINN
FOR CITIZENSHIP,

14:25.190 --> 14:26.555
AND NOW
SHE WAS GONNA OFF HIM

14:26.660 --> 14:28.525
TO UPGRADE AT
THE HUSBAND POSITION, RIGHT?

14:28.630 --> 14:31.019
- "JES" AND "JES".
- ALL RIGHT.

14:31.130 --> 14:32.961
- AND I WAS PRETTY DAMN SURE
SHE HADN'T BEEN

14:33.070 --> 14:35.038
TO MEXICO CITY EITHER.
- WHY'S THAT?

14:35.140 --> 14:37.028
- BECAUSE MY SENSES
NEVER LIE, MR. TROUT,

14:37.140 --> 14:38.562
AND NEITHER DO MY HIPS.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.171
[female Spanish accent]
HELLO.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.271
- HELLO?
- HI.

14:42.380 --> 14:45.042
IS THIS THE VASQUEZ RESIDENCE?

14:45.150 --> 14:45.844
- YES.

14:45.880 --> 14:46.141
- MAY I PLEASE
BE HAVING SPEAKS

14:48.480 --> 14:50.118
WITH MARGA- RITA?

14:50.220 --> 14:51.881
- THIS IS HER FATHER.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.389
RITA HASN'T BEEN HERE
IN ALMOST TWO YEARS.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.549
WHO IS THIS?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.528
- YOU SEE, RITA WAS
SUSPECT NUMERO ONE.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.325
AND WHEN WE FOUND OUT
SHE HAD GONE HOME

15:01.430 --> 15:04.092
TO COLLECT LEO'S THINGS,
WE PAID HER A SURPRISE VISIT.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.088
- AFTER YOU CONTACTED
THE POLICE, RIGHT?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.065
- MOST DEFINITELY.
- YOU NEVER CONTACTED US.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.569
- I LEFT A MESSAGE.
- WITH WHO?

15:09.670 --> 15:13.970
- WITH JEFF MORMEN...SON

15:14.080 --> 15:15.934
OFFICER MORMENSON.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.678
HE'S BRAND-NEW,
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.099
- I NEVER GOT THAT MESSAGE.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

15:19.210 --> 15:20.518
MORMENSON?
DID YOU GET THE MESSAGE?

15:20.620 --> 15:23.111
- JESUS, LASSITER,
YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE, MAN.

15:23.220 --> 15:26.109
- OH, THAT MESSAGE,
OF COURSE.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.196
- RITA?
[knocks on door]

15:40.140 --> 15:42.131
RITA?

15:44.770 --> 15:47.432
GUS?
- YEAH?

15:47.540 --> 15:51.146
- THINGS OFFICIALLY
JUST GOT HAIRY.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.985
- JUST GOT HAIRY?
- SANTA BARBARA STYLE.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.609
- WHY? BECAUSE
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.687
BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.087
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIAR.

16:04.190 --> 16:05.179
YOU'RE A LIAR.

16:05.290 --> 16:06.723
- OKAY.
I SHOULD PROBABLY

16:06.830 --> 16:08.195
START DOING
THE TALKING NOW.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.426
SPENCER'S ALREADY
OUT ON HIS ASS,

16:09.530 --> 16:11.066
AND I STILL GOT
A PENSION TO FIGHT FOR.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.398
- WHAT ABOUT ME? I HAVE
TO DISTANCE MYSELF FROM THIS.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.967
I'M THE GIRLFRIEND.
NO OFFENSE.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.196
- HM?
I WASN'T LISTENING.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.528
- WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

16:16.640 --> 16:18.198
- NO YOU--
NO, YOU RAISED YOUR VOICE.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.039
- LOOK, NO ONE IS LOSING
THEIR JOB OVER THIS.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.630
HIS BARK IS MUCH WORSE
THAN HIS BITE.

16:21.740 --> 16:22.729
- NO. NO, NO, NO.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.501
YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN NOW,
OKAY?

16:24.610 --> 16:26.498
DON'T EVER CALL ME AGAIN.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.168
MOTHERS.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.510
ANYWAY.
SO WHERE WERE WE?

16:30.620 --> 16:33.054
SO YOU FIND THE POISON GUY'S
SEXY WIFE SHOT DEAD.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.616
NOW WAS THIS FINALLY ENOUGH
TO COMPEL YOU

16:34.720 --> 16:36.051
TO CALL THE POLICE?

16:36.160 --> 16:38.583
- YOU KNOW, PERHAPS
I SHOULD TAKE OVER NOW,

16:38.690 --> 16:40.726
SEEING HOW I WAS
THE SENIOR OFFICER ON DUTY.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.196
AT THIS JUNCTURE,
THE CONSULTANT

16:43.300 --> 16:45.518
NOTIFIED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
OF A POSSIBLE 187.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.461
I TRAVELED TO THE SCENE
TO EXAMINE THE 419.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.128
I PROCURED ENTRANCE
TO THE RESIDENCE

16:49.240 --> 16:50.764
WHERE I TOOK OVER
CONTROL OF THE CRIME SCENE

16:50.870 --> 16:53.430
FROM THE BACKUP,
WHICH WAS ALREADY ON SITE.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.599
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT

16:55.710 --> 16:58.599
50 SHADES OF GREY...
MATTER.

16:58.710 --> 17:01.508
[laughter]

17:01.620 --> 17:03.315
- THAT'S NOT EVEN REMOTELY
HOW IT WENT DOWN.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.318
- NOPE.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.785
- I AM TELLING THE STORY NOW.

17:05.890 --> 17:07.312
- ALL RIGHT.
STAND DOWN, CARUSO.

17:07.420 --> 17:10.014
KEEP GOING.
- OKAY.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.781
WE OPENED RITA'S SUITCASE.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.593
[whistles]

17:17.700 --> 17:19.167
THAT IS ONE SEXY BOOK CLUB.

17:19.270 --> 17:22.068
IT'S JUST BOOKS AND PANTIES.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.309
- IT'S A BURNER,
TOTALLY UNTRACEABLE.

17:26.410 --> 17:27.707
THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO USE THESE THINGS

17:27.810 --> 17:29.209
ARE LOW-LIFE CRIMINALS
LIKE DRUG DEALERS,

17:29.310 --> 17:31.073
TERRORISTS, AND PEOPLE
WITH SUBPAR CREDIT.

17:31.180 --> 17:34.547
LET ME SEE WHAT SORDIDNESS
IS ON THE VOICE MAIL.

17:34.650 --> 17:36.379
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN HER CLOSET.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.482
THERE'S MORE,
ALL IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING,

17:38.590 --> 17:41.286
AND THESE CLOTHES
WITH STORE TAGS STILL ON THEM.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.709
- RITA HAD
SOME STICKY FINGERS.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.685
- AND EXQUISITE TASTE.

17:44.790 --> 17:45.825
- LISTEN TO THIS.

17:45.930 --> 17:48.125
- HEY, BABE.
IT'S CHUCK.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.289
MISSING YOU ALREADY.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.493
- WHO'S CHUCK?
- NOT LEO--

17:52.600 --> 17:54.136
THAT'S WHO CHUCK IS.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.265
MEANWHILE,
WE HAD TO DELIVER THE NEWS

17:56.370 --> 17:58.099
OF RITA'S UNTIMELY DEATH
TO POOR LEO.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.599
- SHE WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL
WOMAN ON EARTH.

18:00.710 --> 18:04.202
I'LL BE WITH YOU SOON,
SENORITA.

18:04.310 --> 18:07.177
- UH, NOW MAY BE A GOOD TIME
TO ASK ABOUT PAYMENT.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.816
- YOU ARE THE DEVIL.
- FIRST OF ALL, SHAWN,

18:08.920 --> 18:10.615
THE DEVIL IS WHITE.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.359
- LOOK, LEO, WE SPENT SOME TIME
WITH RITA, OKAY?

18:13.460 --> 18:15.758
SURE, SHE FILLED OUT
THAT DRESS NICELY.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.225
- WHAT?

18:17.330 --> 18:18.581
- BUT WHAT AREN'T
YOU TELLING US, MAN?

18:18.690 --> 18:21.124
- LOOK, RITA HAD HER PROBLEMS--

18:23.330 --> 18:24.729
BUT I REHABILITATED HER.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.263
SHE LOVED ME.

18:26.370 --> 18:27.769
- MM.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.428
MAYBE NOT AS MUCH
AS HE THOUGHT.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.861
- WHY DO YOU KEEP
WHISPERING?

18:31.970 --> 18:33.369
IT'S VERY RUDE.
- IS IT?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.209
WELL, THE CLOCK IS TICKING,
LEO.

18:35.310 --> 18:37.505
YOU WANT US TO FIND YOUR KILLER
BEFORE YOU DIE?

18:37.610 --> 18:38.838
THEN GIVE US SOMETHING, MAN.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.269
GIVE US SOMETHING
WE CAN USE.

18:40.380 --> 18:44.339
- THAT'S IT. MY LIFE IS--
WAS NORMAL.

18:44.450 --> 18:46.145
THE ONLY THING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY

18:46.250 --> 18:48.514
IS A COUPLE DAYS AGO
LOCAL POLICE CALLED

18:48.620 --> 18:50.349
TO SAY THAT MY OFFICE
HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO,

18:50.460 --> 18:52.348
BUT NOTHING WAS TAKEN.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.792
- YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS
SOMETHING WORTH SHARING?

18:54.900 --> 18:56.356
- I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.428
BESIDES, THEY SAID IT WAS
PROBABLY JUST SOME KIDS.

18:58.530 --> 18:59.599
- WELL, GUESS WHAT.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.792
WE'RE GONNA
CHECK THAT OUT.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.265
SO GIVE US AN ADDRESS.

19:02.370 --> 19:04.361
- NO, NO, I'LL--
I'LL TAKE YOU MYSELF.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.607
- WHAT?
- COME ON, LEO. THAT'S SLOPPY.

19:05.710 --> 19:06.836
JUST STAY IN BED.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.170
- I'M NOT GONNA
GET ANY SICKER!

19:09.280 --> 19:10.747
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
SPEND MY LAST

19:10.850 --> 19:12.909
PRECIOUS MOMENTS IN AN E.R.

19:13.010 --> 19:15.444
[both sigh]

19:15.550 --> 19:16.869
- ALL RIGHT.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.641
- [slaps]
- [groans]

19:18.750 --> 19:19.819
- HE ACTUALLY HAD
A DECENT POINT,

19:19.920 --> 19:21.649
SO WE CONVINCED THE DOCTOR
TO GIVE HIM

19:21.760 --> 19:23.785
SOME PRETTY INTENSE
PAIN MEDICATION.

19:23.890 --> 19:25.187
SHAME ON YOU, MAN.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.928
- SHAME ON ME?

19:27.030 --> 19:28.327
- AND WE ALL WENT
TO HIS OFFICE.

19:28.430 --> 19:30.660
- HEY, I GOT
TONS OF STUFF HERE.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.920
NOBODY STOLE ANYTHING.

19:33.030 --> 19:35.169
I MADE THAT.
I'M A "DURAN-Y."

19:35.270 --> 19:37.363
RIO IS MY FAVORITE SONG
OF ALL TIME.

19:37.470 --> 19:40.439
IT'S PURE POETRY.
- IT'S REALLY NOT.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.201
NOW IF HAD SAID, UH,
HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF,

19:42.310 --> 19:44.540
VIEW TO A KILL,
WELL, EVEN THE REFLEX,

19:44.650 --> 19:46.299
YOU WOULD HAVE
HAD AN ARGUMENT, BUT--

19:46.410 --> 19:48.310
- SHAWN, LET THE MAN HAVE THIS.
- NO.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.342
NO.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.258
WHOA, I AM SENSING
THAT SOMEONE

19:56.360 --> 19:59.955
TRIED TO ACCESS
THIS FILING CABINET.

20:00.060 --> 20:01.925
- WHY?
IT'S JUST PEOPLE'S RECORDS.

20:02.030 --> 20:05.295
THERE'S N--

20:05.400 --> 20:07.937
- WHAT?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.929
TALK TO ME, GOOSE.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.608
- OH, MY GOD.
MRS. LAUDERBACH.

20:17.710 --> 20:18.847
- MRS. LAUDER--WHAT?

20:18.950 --> 20:20.440
- MY ONE WEALTHY CLIENT,

20:20.550 --> 20:22.541
I HAD A DUPLICATE OF HER
SAFE DEPOSIT KEY TAPED HERE.

20:22.650 --> 20:23.878
IT'S GONE.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.845
- WHAT'S IN
THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX?

20:26.950 --> 20:31.978
- 10 MILLION IN FLAWLESS,
GEM QUALITY DIAMONDS.

20:32.090 --> 20:32.954
- SO QUINN HAD
THE POWER OF ATTORNEY

20:33.060 --> 20:34.527
OVER LAUDERBACH'S ACCOUNT?

20:34.630 --> 20:35.995
- BUT THE KEY WAS USELESS
ON ITS OWN.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.920
YOU HAD TO GET A BANK EMPLOYEE
TO USE THEIR KEY

20:38.030 --> 20:40.965
IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAUDERBACH'S
TO OPEN THE BOX.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.541
- [gasp5]

20:55.650 --> 20:57.584
OH.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.019
- I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO APOLOGIZE, MRS. LAUDERBACH.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.587
- OH, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

21:04.690 --> 21:07.557
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY, LEO.

21:07.660 --> 21:09.753
- SO WHAT, YOU JUST LET
ANYONE WITH A KEY

21:09.860 --> 21:10.929
WALTZ IN HERE AND STEAL
AN OLD WOMAN'S

21:11.030 --> 21:12.520
HARD EARNED DIAMONDS?

21:12.630 --> 21:13.858
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

21:13.970 --> 21:16.791
WE KEEP A LOG OF ANYONE
WHO ACCESSES THESE BOXES.

21:16.840 --> 21:16.999
SEE? NO ONE ON
MRS. LAUDERBACH'S BEHALF

21:19.710 --> 21:21.439
OR ANYONE ASSOCIATED
WITH HER ESTATE

21:21.540 --> 21:23.576
HAS COME TO ACCESS
HER BOX RECENTLY,

21:23.680 --> 21:25.443
OR IT WOULD'VE BEEN RECORDED.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.676
- DO YOU THINK WE COULD
GET A LOOK

21:26.780 --> 21:29.715
AT YOUR SECURITY TAPES?

21:35.620 --> 21:36.848
RIGHT THERE, PAUSE.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.484
CAN YOU BLOW IT UP?

21:38.590 --> 21:40.751
- WHO THE HELL'S THAT?

21:40.860 --> 21:45.069
- I'M SENSING
THAT IT IS A V. MANUS.

21:45.170 --> 21:46.762
- THAT'S RIGHT.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.497
VICTOR MANUS IS THE OWNER
OF BOX NUMBER 27.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.831
- BUT MANUS WAS A FRAUD--
A FAKE PERSON.

21:51.870 --> 21:52.029
THE ONLY VICTOR MANUS
LISTED IN ANY DATABASE

21:54.540 --> 21:56.838
WAS DEAD BY 1923.
- HM.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.476
[phone ringing]
AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE--

21:58.580 --> 21:59.979
I'M SORRY.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.844
DAMN IT.
I SAID STOP CALLING ME!

22:02.950 --> 22:05.316
DRIVE YOURSELF, MA.
DRIVE YOURSELF.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.911
YOU HAVE A LICENSE!
I'M WOR--

22:08.020 --> 22:09.851
SHE HUNG UP.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.382
SO WHAT DID YOU
MAKE OF THAT?

22:11.490 --> 22:12.650
- WHAT DID WE MAKE OF IT?

22:12.760 --> 22:14.318
THAT SOMEONE POSING
AS VICTOR MANUS

22:14.430 --> 22:15.920
ACQUIRED
THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX

22:16.030 --> 22:17.668
NEXT TO MRS. LAUDERBACH'S.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.919
HE SIGNED THE LOG.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.839
HE WENT INTO
THE SAFETY DEPOSIT ROOM.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.965
HE ACTED AS THOUGH
HE WAS GONNA OPEN BOX 27,

22:23.070 --> 22:27.803
BUT THEN HE SLIPPED HIS LITTLE
TINY KEY INTO BOX 26.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.332
- BUT YOU SAID
YOU NEEDED TWO KEYS.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.873
I MEAN, THERE MUST'VE
BEEN AN ACCOMPLICE HERE.

22:30.980 --> 22:32.470
- THAT'S RIGHT, MR. TROUT.

22:32.580 --> 22:36.471
AND HIS NAME
WAS CHARLES SAX--

22:36.580 --> 22:37.740
BANK EMPLOYEE
THAT WE LEARNED

22:37.850 --> 22:39.044
QUIT HIS JOB ONE DAY LATER.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.710
- CHARLES SAX WAS
VERY LIKELY "CHUCK,"

22:41.820 --> 22:43.048
THE MAN WHO LEFT
THE AMOROUS VOICE MAIL

22:43.160 --> 22:44.650
ON RITA'S MACHINE.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.557
- SO WE BELIEVE
THAT SAX AND RITA WERE--

22:46.660 --> 22:47.888
- WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.729
SO RITA GOT SO SICK
OF BEING STUCK

22:49.830 --> 22:51.661
WITH POOR, PATHETIC LEO
THAT SHE TAKES UP WITH SAX

22:51.770 --> 22:53.829
AND THEY HATCH A PLOT
TO RIP OFF THE OLD BROAD, RIGHT?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.669
BUT THE JOKE'S ON RITA
WHEN SAX AND MANUS

22:55.770 --> 22:57.499
KILL HER AND KEEP THE DIAMONDS
FOR THEMSELVES.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.100
AND JUST TO BE SAFE,
THESE TWO CRIMINAL MASTERMINDS

22:59.210 --> 23:00.905
NEUTRALIZED LEO,
ELIMINATING

23:01.010 --> 23:02.739
ALL POSSIBLE
TRAILS TO THEMSELVES.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.876
SCUMBAG 101.
CLASS DISMISSED.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.845
- PLEASURE
TO WATCH YOU WORK, SIR.

23:06.880 --> 23:07.039
- SO WE TRACKED DOWN SAX.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.146
HE WAS THE ONLY NAME
WE KNEW.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.717
HE WASN'T AT HIS RESIDENCE.

23:11.820 --> 23:13.139
HE DIDN'T WORK
AT THE BANK ANYMORE.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.684
- BUT I HAD A PRETTY GOOD SENSE
OF WHERE TO FIND HIM.

23:19.890 --> 23:21.994
SO, WE LEFT LEO
IN GUS'S CAR.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.499
HE NEEDED TO RELAX.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.567
- LET ME GO WITH YOU.

23:24.670 --> 23:25.921
- UH, YOU STAY HERE.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.498
YOU'VE BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH
FOR ONE DAY, SOLDIER.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.465
- HE CAN'T DIE THERE,
SHAWN.

23:30.570 --> 23:31.832
IT'S A COMPANY CAR.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.100
I ONCE LEFT A HALF-EATEN
SANDWICH IN THERE

23:33.210 --> 23:35.474
AND I CAUGHT HELL FOR IT.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.979
DON'T DIE.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.877
- I'LL TRY.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.641
- HI, THERE.
- HELLO.

23:40.750 --> 23:41.978
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR SAX.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.638
- EXCUSE ME?

23:43.750 --> 23:47.117
- DO YOU HAVE A CHARLES SAX
REGISTERED HERE?

23:47.220 --> 23:49.518
- UM, NO CHARLES SAX.

23:49.620 --> 23:50.848
- CHARLIE. NO, CHUCK.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.428
NO. I BET YOU IT'S CHAZ.
CHAZ SAX.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.919
- NO. NO SAX OF ANY KIND.

23:56.030 --> 23:57.861
- THIS IS A MONUMENTAL
WASTE OF TIME.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.722
LET'S GO.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.798
- HOW ABOUT A VICTOR MANUS?

24:05.670 --> 24:08.070
HE IS IN ROOM 312.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.800
- I SENSED THAT VICTOR MANUS

24:11.910 --> 24:13.878
WAS THE GANG'S GO-TO ALIAS.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.015
- I SENSED
THE EXACT SAME THING.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.576
- THAT IS A BALD-FACED LIE.

24:16.680 --> 24:17.715
- YOU'RE A BALD-FACED LIE.

24:17.820 --> 24:18.946
- KEEP GOING.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.689
[knock at door]

24:25.160 --> 24:28.095
- HOUSEKEEPING.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.758
- HELLO, CHUCK.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.919
- UM, HELLO.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.736
- WHERE'S MANUS?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.034
IF THAT'S HIS REAL NAME.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.596
- IT WASN'T MY IDEA.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.099
I'M JUST A GUY
WHO WORKS AT A BANK.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.734
- BATH ROOM'S CLEAR.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.001
- THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO
BUT DOWN.

24:42.110 --> 24:44.169
- I-I KNOW WHERE MANUS IS.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.770
I'LL TELL YOU
HIS REAL NAME.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.847
[gunshot]

24:51.120 --> 24:54.817
- I COULD HAVE BEEN
SMOKING THESE MY WHOLE LIFE.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.684
[thud]

25:02.030 --> 25:03.998
- NICE.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.660
SO KEEP GOIN'.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.965
- UH, SO WE'VE GOT
TWO DEAD BODIES

25:09.070 --> 25:09.991
AND ONE MORE
CIRCLING THE DRAIN.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.000
- HOW CLOSE ARE WE
TO THE PART

25:12.110 --> 25:13.907
WHERE YOU GUYS TURN 10K
INTO A BAD EPISODE OF CHiPs ?

25:14.010 --> 25:16.535
- FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE NO
BAD EPISODES OF CHiPs.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.540
- WHAT ABOUT THE ONE WHERE
PONCH WAS PLAGUED WITH BAD LUCK

25:18.650 --> 25:20.277
AFTER THEY PULLED OVER
A VAN FULL OF BLACK CATS?

25:20.380 --> 25:21.813
- THAT WAS CHARACTER
ENRICHMENT, GUS.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.046
- MM, NO.
- LET ME SPEED THIS ALONG.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.515
AFTER SAX GOT SHOT,
WE TOOK LEO

25:24.620 --> 25:27.009
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL
BECAUSE GUS WAS AFRAID

25:27.120 --> 25:28.656
HIS CAR WAS GOING
TO SMELL LIKE DEAD DUDE.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.648
- NO, I WANTED TO GET LEO
SOME MORE PAIN MEDS.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.954
- LIAR.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.823
- THE POISON SPECIFICALLY
TARGETS THE LIVER,

25:33.930 --> 25:38.094
WHICH IS THE REASON FOR
THE YELLOW EYE DISCOLORATION.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.997
- OH, MAN, LEO.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.898
- I NEED YOU
TO DO TWO THINGS.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.637
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

25:46.740 --> 25:49.277
AND CATCH THE PERSON
THAT DID THIS TO ME.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.974
- HEY.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.718
YOU HAVE OUR WORD.

25:53.820 --> 25:57.039
- NOT CONTAGIOUS.

25:57.150 --> 25:58.981
- IT WAS LATE,

25:59.090 --> 26:00.955
SO WE STOPPED
FOR A QUICK DINNER.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.914
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
both: CHEERS.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.726
- OH, WHAT?

26:04.830 --> 26:06.286
THEN WE WENT HOME,
SLEPT FOR JUST A FEW HOURS,

26:06.390 --> 26:08.028
MET BRIGHT AND EARLY
THE NEXT MORNING

26:08.130 --> 26:09.051
FOR A QUICK BREAKFAST.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.264
JUST COME HERE.
- THERE IT IS.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.191
- ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL SEE YA.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.894
- THEN WE STARTED
TRACKING DOWN OUR SUSPECT.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.036
- OKAY, THE MOUSTACHE MAN
POSING AS MANUS

26:19.140 --> 26:20.869
WHO KILLED RITA QUINN
AND CHARLES SAX

26:20.980 --> 26:22.732
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANNA
SPLIT THE DIAMONDS.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.068
- SPOT ON AGAIN, SIR.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.772
- LOOK, YOUR BUTT-KISSING
IS CHAPPING MY ASS.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.177
CUT IT OUT, DETECTIVE.
- YES, SIR.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.578
- UM, WE BELIEVED
THAT IF WE DISCOVERED

26:29.680 --> 26:31.648
VICTOR MANUS'S TRUE IDENTITY,
THEN WE ALSO--

26:31.750 --> 26:33.012
[timer dings]

26:33.120 --> 26:34.951
- UH. HOLD ON A SECOND,
CUPCAKE.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.880
WAIT A MINUTE.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.079
[winds timer]

26:47.070 --> 26:48.196
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.938
ALL RIGHT,
SO GO AHEAD.

26:50.040 --> 26:54.170
- UM, IF--IF WE FIND
HIS TRUE IDENTITY,

26:54.280 --> 26:55.907
THEN WE WOULD
FIND THE KILLER

26:56.010 --> 26:58.342
AND ALSO THE DIAMONDS.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.974
- SO SHAWN AND I
WENT BACK TO LEO

27:00.080 --> 27:01.149
TO TRY TO FIND A NEW LEAD.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.138
- LEO?

27:03.250 --> 27:05.115
BUT ALAS,
WE WERE TOO LATE.

27:05.220 --> 27:07.859
- I'M SORRY.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.882
HE JUST PASSED AWAY.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.129
- WHAT?
- WE WERE DEVASTATED...

27:13.430 --> 27:15.022
OR A CHECK ADDRESSED
TO PSYCH?

27:15.130 --> 27:16.654
- FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
OF COURSE.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.024
DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT
JESUS WOULD ASK RIGHT NOW?

27:19.130 --> 27:20.995
- YES, BECAUSE HE NEEDED
MONEY FOR SANDALS.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.739
- UH, I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
- MAN.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.637
- BUT LOOK,
WE'LL RUN AN AUTOPSY

27:25.740 --> 27:27.332
JUST TO CONFIRM
THE DIAGNOSIS.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.375
BUT, UH, I HAVE NO DOUBTS.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.108
I'M SORRY.

27:33.210 --> 27:34.677
- BUT THE NEXT DAY
WE GOT A CALL

27:34.780 --> 27:36.418
FROM THE LOCAL MORTICIAN,
AND IT TURNS OUT

27:36.520 --> 27:38.317
GOOD OL' LEO
LEFT US A LITTLE SOMETHING.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.842
- HERE YOU GO.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.986
HOT OUT OF THE OVEN.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.657
- HM. HIS ASHES?
- YUP.

27:46.760 --> 27:50.196
12 OUNCES OF DISGUSTING
CINDERED GINGER DEAD DUDE.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.995
- HE ASKED US TO SPRINKLE

27:52.100 --> 27:53.931
THOSE ASHES
OFF STEARNS WHARF.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.792
IT'S THE ONLY JEWISH WHARF
IN ALL OF SANTA BARBARA,

27:55.900 --> 27:57.800
SO IT FELT LIKE
THE VERY LEAST WE COULD DO.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.074
- OF COURSE NOT. THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.977
- NO, WE PUT IT
IN THE BACK OF MY CAR.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.105
WE WERE PLANNING ON
DOING IT LATER.

28:06.210 --> 28:08.917
- THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT THEN...

28:09.020 --> 28:11.238
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

28:11.350 --> 28:13.853
- DON'T EVEN TELL ME.
- NO.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.918
OH, CRAP!
[tires screeching]

28:17.020 --> 28:19.079
- NO!

28:19.190 --> 28:21.226
- [coughs]

28:22.400 --> 28:24.061
[gasp5]
OH, MY--

28:24.170 --> 28:25.364
YOU SAID IT WAS CAKE MIX!

28:25.470 --> 28:26.994
- NO, I NEVER SAID--
- YES, YOU DID!

28:27.100 --> 28:28.362
YOU SAID YOU AND GUS
WERE GONNA GO HOME

28:28.470 --> 28:29.994
AND YOU WERE GONNA
MAKE HOMEMADE TWINKIES!

28:30.100 --> 28:31.738
- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
MAKING STUFF UP, SWEETIE.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.068
- RUBBISH.
- SON OF A BITCH!

28:33.170 --> 28:34.933
' [gagging]

28:35.040 --> 28:36.234
- HEY.
[whistles]

28:36.340 --> 28:37.876
- OH, CARLTON!

28:37.980 --> 28:40.244
CARLTON, LET HIM GO!
CARLTON!

28:40.350 --> 28:41.874
- GUS, GET HIM OFF OF ME!
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

28:41.980 --> 28:43.277
HE'S COVERED IN DEAD DUDE,
SHAWN.

28:43.380 --> 28:46.941
[air horn blows]

28:47.050 --> 28:48.256
- [coughs]

28:48.360 --> 28:50.089
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

28:50.190 --> 28:51.726
YOU GUYS ARE BEHAVING
LIKE MY NEPHEWS

28:51.830 --> 28:52.785
NOAH, RYDER, AND STEPHAN.

28:52.890 --> 28:55.051
AND I HATE MY NEPHEWS!

28:55.160 --> 28:57.025
AND IF YOU MET THEM,
YOU'D HATE THEM TO!

28:57.130 --> 28:58.722
AND THAT WOULD MAKE
A LOT MORE SENSE.

28:58.830 --> 29:00.422
CONTINUE.
- OKAY.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.169
SO, IN ADDITION
TO THE ASHES,

29:03.270 --> 29:06.239
LEO ALSO LEFT US A FEW
OF HIS RANDOM PERSONAL ITEMS

29:06.340 --> 29:09.468
AND A NOTE ADDRESSED
TO THE TWO OF US.

29:09.580 --> 29:12.401
IT TURNED OUT TO BE
PRETTY INVALUABLE.

29:12.510 --> 29:15.172
- SHAWN AND GUS,
DON'T SEE YOURSELVES

29:15.280 --> 29:17.009
AS FAILURES
FOR NOT FINDING MY KILLER.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.883
THE FACT THAT I FEEL THAT WAY
IS IRRELEVANT

29:18.990 --> 29:20.139
BECAUSE I AM DEAD NOW.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.979
- WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:22.090 --> 29:23.978
- TRYING TO RECOUP
SOME OF THE MONEY HE OWES US.

29:24.090 --> 29:25.318
- WHAT, BY STEALING
HIS STAPLER?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.796
- THESE THINGS ARE WORTH
2 BUCKS ON EBAY, SHAWN.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.869
- IT'S WEIRD AND SAD
THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.790
- JUST KNOW
THAT I HAVE TOTAL FAITH

29:32.900 --> 29:35.835
THAT YOU'LL CATCH THEM
AND YOU'LL DISPOSE OF MY ASHES

29:35.940 --> 29:39.034
IN THE RESPECTFUL MANNER
THAT I REQUESTED.

29:39.140 --> 29:41.506
- ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENER.
CHA-CHING.

29:41.610 --> 29:43.475
- I JUST WISH I'D GIVEN YOU
MORE TO GO ON.

29:43.580 --> 29:46.048
SO AS I LAY HERE
WRITING MY FINAL WORDS,

29:46.150 --> 29:48.175
A NAME COMES TO MIND
THAT I FEEL

29:48.280 --> 29:49.417
MAY BE WORTH LOOKING INTO.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.919
IT'S A FORMER CLIENT

29:50.950 --> 29:51.109
BY THE NAME
OF CURTIS STANZEN.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.815
- GOT IT.
GOT IT.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.026
- WHAT'S HIS DEAL?

29:59.130 --> 30:01.325
- WHOA. HE HAS QUITE
THE ARREST RECORD, HUH?

30:01.430 --> 30:04.319
ASSAULT, BURGLARY,
POSSESSION,

30:04.430 --> 30:06.022
AND OF COURSE--

30:06.130 --> 30:07.939
- IDENTITY FRAUD.

30:07.970 --> 30:08.129
- SO WE GRABBED
A HEALTHY SNACK,

30:10.140 --> 30:11.459
AND WE SHARED
OUR TOTALLY AWESOME LEAD

30:11.570 --> 30:13.936
WITH LASSIE AND JULES.

30:13.980 --> 30:14.139
- THIS IS A 3.5. LEAD.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.072
- ONE MORE LICK AT THAT THING
AND YOUR TONGUE

30:17.180 --> 30:18.807
IS GOING TO BE
PERMANENTLY GREEN.

30:18.910 --> 30:20.946
- AND IT'S 100% WORTH IT.

30:21.050 --> 30:22.142
- IF YOU TWO CHILDREN
ARE READY,

30:22.250 --> 30:23.319
LET'S GET THIS BOONDOGGLE
UNDER WAY.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.842
- LASSIE,
YOU KNOW STANZEN

30:24.950 --> 30:25.746
IS A SUPPLIER
OF COUNTERFEIT I.D.S.

30:25.850 --> 30:27.511
HE COULD BE OUR LINK
TO VICTOR MANUS.

30:27.620 --> 30:28.951
- THIS IS NO BOONDOGGLE.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.482
WHAT'S A BOONDOGGLE?

30:30.590 --> 30:32.455
- S.B.P.D.!

30:32.560 --> 30:34.448
- CAN YOU USE IT IN A SENTENCE?
- OF COURSE I CAN.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.199
- IS IT ONE PART BABOON
AND ONE PART PUGGLE?

30:37.300 --> 30:38.198
[engine whirring]

30:38.300 --> 30:39.927
- OH, WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

30:39.970 --> 30:40.129
- OH, THAT IS A LAWN MOWER,

30:41.600 --> 30:44.865
OR POSSIBLY A GO-KART
WITH A LAWN MOWER ENGINE.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.508
[tires screeching]

30:53.080 --> 30:54.342
IT'S A MOTORCYCLE!

30:54.450 --> 30:57.169
IT'S A MOTORCYCLE.
- SON OF A BITCH!

31:01.120 --> 31:03.509
[engines start]

31:10.100 --> 31:12.068
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:12.170 --> 31:14.889
YOU JUST--

31:15.000 --> 31:18.265
YOU IDIOT!

31:18.370 --> 31:20.634
- [screaming]

31:22.640 --> 31:24.403
OH!
- GOSH!

31:24.510 --> 31:27.070
- GUS, I DON'T THINK
THIS LID IS SEALED.

31:27.180 --> 31:29.114
[horn honks]
- LOOK OUT!

31:29.220 --> 31:32.189
[tires screeching]

31:32.290 --> 31:35.589
- AAH!
- OH, CRAP!

31:35.690 --> 31:37.351
- I KNOW THIS PART.
- RIGHT.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.122
SO THE CARS COLLIDE,
SMASHY, SMASHY.

31:40.230 --> 31:41.993
WE ALL GET OUT.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.522
- YOU SON OF A--

31:43.630 --> 31:45.097
- [coughs]

31:45.200 --> 31:47.088
- WHERE'D YOU LEARN
HOW TO DRIVE?

31:47.200 --> 31:48.098
- SWEETIE!
- WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

31:48.200 --> 31:52.034
- IT'S CAKE--CAKE MIX.

31:52.140 --> 31:53.664
- OH.

31:53.770 --> 31:55.203
SWEETIE, I DID SAY THAT.
- MM-HMM.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.937
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

31:56.980 --> 31:57.139
- SPENCER, CONTINUE
TELLING THE STORY OR I'M GONNA

31:58.610 --> 32:00.168
BLAST YOU LIKE
A FRIGGIN' WAYWARD TUGBOAT.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.510
DON'T PLAY ME.
- OKAY. THAT'S FAIR.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.247
WE WERE ALL AFRAID
THAT STANZEN HAD ESCAPED,

32:04.350 --> 32:06.011
BUT THEN WE REALIZED
SOMETHING.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.055
UH-OH.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.616
- GET UP, STANZEN!

32:10.720 --> 32:14.019
GET UP!

32:14.130 --> 32:16.098
- [sighs]
HE'S DEAD.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.021
- OH, CRAP.

32:28.210 --> 32:32.101
- LOOKS LIKE HE'S
OUR MAN...US.

32:32.210 --> 32:33.643
- I GUESS THE CRASH
KILLED HIM.

32:33.750 --> 32:37.174
- WHOA.

32:37.280 --> 32:41.080
WITH A LITTLE BIT POISON
CALLED WD40.

32:41.190 --> 32:42.953
- COMPOUND 1080.
- I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.618
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T.
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S

32:44.730 --> 32:46.288
EVEN MORE TIRED THAN ME SAYING
"I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS"?

32:46.390 --> 32:47.687
- ME SAYING "NO, YOU HAVEN'T"?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

32:47.790 --> 32:49.257
- AGREE TO DISAGREE.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.691
- IT'S A DIAGNOSIS
THAT IS CONFIRMED

32:50.800 --> 32:52.097
BY THE TOXICOLOGY REPORT.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.430
APPARENTLY IT IS ESTIMATED
THAT THE POISON

32:54.540 --> 32:56.292
HAD BEEN IN HIS SYSTEM
FOR OVER 36 HOURS.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.539
- HM. SO YOUR THEORY
THAT THE KILLER

32:58.640 --> 33:00.608
WAS A FELLOW HEIST MEMBER
NO LONGER HOLDS WATER.

33:00.710 --> 33:03.133
WHY?
'CAUSE THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.572
- WELL, WE ACTUALLY
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

33:05.680 --> 33:07.545
A FOURTH MEMBER
THAT HADN'T BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.049
- HM. THAT'S FASCINATING.

33:09.150 --> 33:11.311
SO WHO DO YOU SURMISE
THIS PERSON MIGHT BE?

33:11.420 --> 33:13.012
ANY IDEAS?

33:13.120 --> 33:16.089
I'LL GO AROUND THE ROOM.
ANYONE?

33:16.190 --> 33:17.418
HOW ABOUT YOU,
MAGIC MIKE?

33:17.520 --> 33:20.080
- I ACTUALLY DANCE
BY THE NAME "MORNINGWOOD."

33:20.190 --> 33:21.259
- OF COURSE YOU DO.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.089
MORNINGWOOD.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.191
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
- OKAY, LOOK.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.268
IN MY OFFICERS' DEFENSE,
IT'S KINDA HARD

33:27.370 --> 33:29.031
TO FIND SUSPECT S
WHEN THEY'VE BEEN

33:29.140 --> 33:30.698
ANSWERING QUESTIONS
IN A ROOM ALL DAY.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.234
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE
TO CONCUR WITH THE CHIEF HERE.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.103
WHILE WE ARE SITTING HERE
GIVING YOU A PLAY-BY-PLAY,

33:35.210 --> 33:38.077
THE KILLER COULD BE
HALFWAY TO TANZANIA.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.741
- HOLY CRAP!

33:47.290 --> 33:49.281
I KNOW WHO THE KILLER IS.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.683
- SO WHO'S THE KILLER THEN?

33:53.790 --> 33:56.054
THE BANK MANAGER?
MRS. LAUDERBACH?

33:56.160 --> 33:58.321
THE SNOW CONE GUY?
- DESK CLERK AT THE HOTEL?

33:58.430 --> 33:59.761
- YOU GUYS
ARE FORGETTING SOMEONE.

33:59.870 --> 34:00.768
- MAYBE IT WAS MY MOM,
SHERLOCK.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.164
SHE'S A SQUIRRELLY LITTLE BAT.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.269
- JUDAS PRIEST, MAN.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.600
JUST TELL US WHO IT IS.

34:05.710 --> 34:11.398
- HE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US
THE WHOLE DAMN TIME.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.569
- QUINN?
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.444
- SO DID I. MY SENSES,
HOWEVER, WEREN'T SO SURE.

34:16.550 --> 34:20.338
AND THEN, THE CHIEF PUT THIS
VERY CLOSE TO MY FACE.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.315
IT TELLS US TWO THINGS.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.786
ONE, CURTIS STANZEN
BORE A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE

34:24.890 --> 34:26.187
TO KYLE BORNHEIMER.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.099
TWO, HE SHOWED ALL
THE TELLTALE SYMPTOMS

34:28.200 --> 34:30.657
OF BLINK 182 POISONING.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.763
- COMPOUND 1080.
- EXACTLY.

34:33.870 --> 34:35.132
- SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT,
SPENCER?

34:35.240 --> 34:36.662
- THE POINT IS,
LEO DIDN'T,

34:36.770 --> 34:39.432
MEANING HE WAS JUST
PRETENDING TO BE POISONED.

34:39.540 --> 34:40.734
- AND WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

34:40.840 --> 34:42.239
- BECAUSE NO ONE LOOKS
FOR A DEAD MAN.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.739
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.772
COULD SOMEONE JUST PLEASE
BACK US UP A BIT?

34:44.810 --> 34:45.174
- MY PLEASURE, CHIEF.

34:46.410 --> 34:47.775
YOU SEE, LEO WAS STUCK
IN A CRAP JOB

34:47.880 --> 34:49.472
WITH A PHILANDERING,
BUT SMOKING HOT WIFE.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.286
SO HE HATCHED
THE FOLLOWING PLAN.

34:51.390 --> 34:52.743
USE RITA'S SPECIAL FRIEND,

34:52.850 --> 34:54.454
CHARLES SAX FROM THE BANK,

34:54.560 --> 34:56.778
TO BREAK INTO HIS OFFICE
AND STEAL MRS. LAUDERBACH'S KEY,

34:56.890 --> 34:58.778
THUS ABSOLVING LEO
OF ANY FUTURE GUILT.

34:58.830 --> 34:59.182
- THEN HE HAD SAX AND STANZEN
STEAL THE DIAMONDS.

35:01.630 --> 35:02.756
- BUT THIS IS LEO,
HE'S MISERABLE.

35:02.860 --> 35:03.849
HIS WIFE BANGS EVERYBODY.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.393
HE WANTS THE DIAMONDS
FOR HIMSELF.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.797
HE FEELS LIKE
HE DESERVES THEM,

35:06.830 --> 35:07.194
BUT IF HE RUNS OFF, HIS PARTNERS
ARE GONNA CHASE HIM.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.635
IF HE KILLS HIS PARTNERS,
THE COPS ARE GONNA GET HIM.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.833
SO WITH THE HELP
OF DR. UMMA--

35:12.940 --> 35:15.238
UMMA, WHO I WILL
GET TO IN A MINUTE--

35:15.340 --> 35:16.830
HE MADE IT APPEAR
AS IF HE HAD BEEN POISONED.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.771
- THEN HE HIRES US
TO FURTHER THE RUSE

35:18.810 --> 35:19.174
AND INFORM HIS COCONSPIRATORS
THAT THEY MAY BE IN DANGER TOO.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.319
- BY KILLING RITA,
HE'S GOT SAX AND STANZEN

35:24.420 --> 35:27.412
SO FREAKED OUT THAT EACH OF 'EM
ARE TRYING TO KILL THE OTHER.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.579
- WELL, WE KNOW STANZEN
BEAT SAX TO THAT PUNCH.

35:29.690 --> 35:30.714
[gunshot]

35:36.260 --> 35:37.557
- STANZEN?
- CORRECT.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.560
BUT HE GOT THAT BALL ROLLING
36 HOURS EARLIER

35:39.670 --> 35:41.695
WHEN HE SLIPPED HIM
A LITTLE P90X.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.597
all: COMPOUND 1080.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.429
- I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HAVING
SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THAT.

35:45.540 --> 35:46.768
IT'S A LITTLE SILLY.

35:46.870 --> 35:49.407
ANYWAY--
[timer dings]

35:49.510 --> 35:52.172
- [snaps]

35:52.280 --> 35:53.542
STAY IN YOUR OWN LANE.

35:53.650 --> 35:54.844
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
WHAT I'M DOING.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.770
- OKAY. LEO'S GOT
TWO THINGS LEFT TO DO.

35:56.820 --> 35:57.172
ONE, STAGE HIS OWN DEATH.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.912
TWO, GET RID OF THE LAST GUY
HE OWES MONEY TO--

36:02.020 --> 36:05.285
DR. UMMA.

36:05.390 --> 36:08.291
SO HE KILLED TWO BIRDS.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.221
NOW THAT HE HAD
DOUBLE-CROSSED UMMA--UMMA--

36:11.330 --> 36:12.922
ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE,

36:13.030 --> 36:14.634
HE WAS FREE TO GO LIVE
ANYWHERE HE WANTED

36:14.740 --> 36:16.662
AS A RICH DEAD MAN.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.937
- LEAVING US TO LOOK
FOR A FOURTH MEMBER

36:21.040 --> 36:22.473
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.468
- IT'S PRETTY GENIUS
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

36:24.580 --> 36:25.842
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
SIT AROUND HERE

36:25.950 --> 36:26.905
THINKING ABOUT IT,
'CAUSE I HAVE

36:27.010 --> 36:30.411
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.385
THANKS, CHIEF.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.487
[air horn blows]

36:38.590 --> 36:40.956
- ALL RIGHT, NO ONE
IS GOING ANYWHERE,

36:41.060 --> 36:42.425
BECAUSE I'M SUSPENDING
ALL OF YOU

36:42.530 --> 36:43.895
FROM THIS INVESTIGATION.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.763
all: WHAT?
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.428
[chuckles]
I GET IT.

36:47.530 --> 36:49.930
YOUR JOB IS TO COME DOWN HERE,
SQUEEZE SOME GRAPES,

36:50.040 --> 36:51.769
RUFFLE SOME FEATHERS.
YOU DID IT.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.303
WHY ARE YOU GONNA
SUSPEND US?

36:53.410 --> 36:54.729
I MEAN,
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

36:54.840 --> 36:55.636
- ESSENTIALLY,
YOU ASSISTED

36:55.680 --> 36:56.203
IN THE PLAN
OF A MURDERING THIEF.

36:57.910 --> 37:00.344
- OH, COME ON. EVEN YOU YOURSELF
DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS QUINN.

37:00.450 --> 37:01.872
- YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE MY HEAD WAS SPINNING

37:01.980 --> 37:03.948
FROM THE RAMPANT
DISREGARD FOR PROCEDURE

37:04.050 --> 37:06.484
AND THE JAW-DROPPING
UNPROFESSIONALISM.

37:06.590 --> 37:08.956
EXAMPLES:
INTEROFFICE DATING,

37:09.060 --> 37:10.880
DESECRATION
OF HUMAN REMAINS,

37:10.990 --> 37:14.949
CHOKING A FELLOW OFFICER.

37:15.060 --> 37:16.948
- MAN-STRIPPING.
- AND MAN-STRIPPING.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.869
- GUS!
- THE SILENCE KILLS ME.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.859
- UGH. SO WE'RE JUST GONNA
LET QUINN GO?

37:21.970 --> 37:23.631
- NO, I'M APPOINTING
OFFICER DOBSON LEAD ON THE CASE,

37:23.740 --> 37:24.968
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.
- DOBSON?

37:25.070 --> 37:26.469
HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

37:26.570 --> 37:27.559
PLUS, HE'S LAZY.
- OH, REALLY?

37:27.670 --> 37:28.876
HERE'S ANOTHER FACT.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.504
TONIGHT, I'M DELIVERING
A SCATHING REPORT

37:30.610 --> 37:31.804
TO THE MAYOR
ON THIS CRAP OMELET

37:31.910 --> 37:33.468
YOU GUYS CALL A DEPARTMENT,
AND THEN

37:35.520 --> 37:37.715
COPY?

37:37.820 --> 37:38.741
TILL THEN,
YOU'RE ALL SUSPENDED.

37:38.850 --> 37:40.841
- [gasp5]

37:43.020 --> 37:44.851
- CHIEF, YOU CAN'T
JUST LET THIS HAPPEN.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.986
- I'M SORRY,
BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED.

37:48.090 --> 37:52.390
- SO I GUESS THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.890
- YEP, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.474
DR. RICHARD UMMA,
PLEASE COME TO THE FRONT DESK.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.901
DR. RICHARD UMMA.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.779
WELL, HELLO, DOCTOR.

38:13.890 --> 38:14.914
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW

38:15.020 --> 38:16.385
THAT YOU'VE
BEEN UPGRADED TODAY.

38:16.490 --> 38:17.650
- TO PRISON.
- REMEMBER OZ?

38:17.760 --> 38:18.749
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT.

38:18.860 --> 38:19.986
- EXCEPT THERE IS NO WIZARD.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.398
- HOW'D YOU KNOW?

38:21.500 --> 38:22.956
- WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOU CHOSE

38:23.060 --> 38:25.290
A DESTINATION STRAIGHT OUT
OF YOUR FAVORITE SONG.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.618
- RIO, WHICH IS THE NAME
OF A GIRL IN THE SONG,

38:27.730 --> 38:28.890
NOT THE ACTUAL PLACE.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.490
- AND SECONDLY,
YOU FORGOT TO REMOVE

38:30.600 --> 38:32.568
A TEENY THING
FROM THE DOCTOR'S BODY

38:32.670 --> 38:34.604
BEFORE YOU ROLLED HIM
INTO THE MORGUE.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.370
- HIS HEARING AID.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.710
- HIS HEARING AID, LEO!

38:42.820 --> 38:46.312
JIG'S UP, MAN.

38:46.420 --> 38:49.617
- GUESS IT IS.
- GUESS IT IS.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.079
- OH!

38:53.190 --> 38:55.021
- THEY ALWAYS RUN.

38:57.430 --> 39:00.490
- JIG IS UP, QUINN.
- STOP SAYING THAT.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.564
- OH, MAN, I MUST'VE SMASHED
INTO A DIRTY TRAY

39:06.670 --> 39:07.932
BACK AT THAT LOUNGE.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.371
I GOT KETCHUP ALL OVER ME.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.731
- WE'RE COVERED IN HUMAN ASH.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.398
- IT'S NOT A COMPETITION,
JULES.

39:12.510 --> 39:13.841
- UH-OH.

39:13.950 --> 39:16.874
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE OUR MEDICINE.

39:19.050 --> 39:21.348
- YOU JUST STAY STRONG,
OKAY?

39:21.460 --> 39:23.382
- I GOT IT, SHAWN.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.524
- BACK TO WORK.

39:33.630 --> 39:34.858
- [exhales]

39:34.970 --> 39:36.392
OH, MY GOD.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.058
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
ONE OF US WAS GETTING FIRED.

39:38.170 --> 39:39.398
- [laughs]

39:39.510 --> 39:42.377
- CHIEF?

39:42.480 --> 39:44.573
- I GOT A SIX-MO|\II\IJIH SUSPENSION.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.840
- COULD'VE BEEN A LOT WORSE.

39:45.880 --> 39:46.039
- THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

39:47.610 --> 39:48.838
WE'RE THE ONES
WHO IGNORED THE ORDER.

39:48.950 --> 39:49.871
- WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS HOPING

39:49.980 --> 39:51.413
THAT YOU WOULD DO.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.839
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING
TO PRETEND

39:52.890 --> 39:53.049
THAT I RUN
THE TIGHTEST DEPARTMENT.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.857
IN FACT,
IT'S OFTEN A CIRCUS,

39:55.890 --> 39:56.049
BUT I STAND BY THE RESULTS.

39:58.690 --> 40:01.022
SO WHEN IT COMES TO PISSING OFF
A BUREAUCRAT

40:01.130 --> 40:02.722
OR GOING OUT
AND CATCHING THE BAD GUYS,

40:02.830 --> 40:04.718
I WILL CHOOSE THE LATTER
EVERY TIME,

40:04.830 --> 40:06.889
SO DO NOT WORRY.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.036
THIS IS A SWORD
I'M HAPPY TO FALL ON.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.701
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU, MAN.

40:13.810 --> 40:16.574
- AND I, YOU...
ON OCCASION.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.406
NO, JUST--

40:23.220 --> 40:26.087
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

40:26.190 --> 40:27.942
I GET TO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER
FROM SCHOOL

40:28.050 --> 40:30.189
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN SIX MONTHS.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.159
- HEY, MORNINGFART.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.898
I WANT HER OFFICE CLEARED OUT
IMMEDIATELY PLEASE,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.069
AND CLEAR OUT YOUR OWN TOO.

40:43.170 --> 40:44.603
YOU'RE ALSO FIRED.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.029
- BUT I DON'T HAVE
AN OFFICE.

40:46.140 --> 40:48.005
- FANTASTIC.

40:48.110 --> 40:49.600
THEN GRAB YOUR BOW TIE
AND YOUR THONG

40:49.710 --> 40:52.645
AND HIT THE BRICKS.

40:55.180 --> 40:57.944
- HEY, TROUT, I WANNA
GET SOMETHING OFF MY CHEST.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.210
- YOU JUST SUSPENDED
THE GREATEST CHIEF OF POLICE

41:02.320 --> 41:03.787
IN THIS CITY'S HISTORY.

41:03.890 --> 41:05.858
- WHICH SPANS WHAT,
50 YEARS?

41:05.960 --> 41:07.086
- OKAY, LOOK, WE KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE IT HERE.

41:07.190 --> 41:08.794
BUT GUESS WHAT.
THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.151
- 'CAUSE YOU WALTZ IN HERE
ACTING LIKE

41:10.260 --> 41:11.898
YOU FIX PROBLEMS,
WHEN IN REALITY

41:12.000 --> 41:13.490
YOU'RE THE ONE CAUSING THEM
BY GETTING IN THE WAY

41:13.600 --> 41:15.465
OF HARDWORKING
POLICE OFFICERS LIKE US.

41:15.570 --> 41:16.992
- AND SEMI-HARDWORKING
PSYCHICS

41:17.100 --> 41:18.237
AND THEIR BLACK PARTNERS.

41:18.340 --> 41:20.638
- WHO ALSO SELL PHARMACEUTICALS
ON THE SIDE,

41:20.740 --> 41:24.506
MR. SANDMAN.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.475
- SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHUFFLE ON BACK TO BUFFALO

41:26.580 --> 41:28.070
KNOWING THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE
YOU'VE HELPED HERE

41:28.180 --> 41:30.216
ARE THE CRIMINALS.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.117
- AND, IF YOU'RE WONDERING
WHO ATE

41:32.220 --> 41:33.778
THE REST OF YOUR
BALANCE BAR,

41:33.890 --> 41:35.858
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THIS...

41:35.960 --> 41:37.609
[whispers]
BECAUSE IT WAS ME.

41:37.720 --> 41:40.154
- * SUCK IT

41:40.260 --> 41:41.955
- WELL, THAT WAS
GOOD TO KNOW.

41:42.060 --> 41:45.996
BUT I HAVE NEWS FOR ALL OF YOU.
I'M STAYING.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.829
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

41:47.930 --> 41:49.932
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE NEW
INTERIM CHIEF OF POLICE.

41:50.040 --> 41:54.238
- CORRECT,
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

41:54.340 --> 41:55.932
- IT'LL BE A PLEASURE
WORKING WITH YOU, SIR.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.109
- THIS DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.848
I MEAN, YOU--
YOU HATE IT HERE.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.542
- I DO,
BUT I HATE IT EVERYWHERE.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.618
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
YOU GUYS TO WORRY.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.018
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
ANY DRASTIC CHANGES...

42:05.120 --> 42:06.587
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT WE'LL NO LONGER

42:06.690 --> 42:08.749
BE HIRING PSYCHICS

42:08.860 --> 42:11.112
AND YOU'RE NO LONGER
HEAD DETECTIVE.

42:11.220 --> 42:13.723
AND I'M PAINTING THESE WALLS.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.588
* SUCK IT

42:23.740 --> 42:25.207
- HE SANG OUR SONG.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.938
- IT'S ON NOW.
