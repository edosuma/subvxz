A NETFLIX SERIES

00:07.500 --> 00:11.208
The award for Best French Male Artist
of the Year goes to

00:11.750 --> 00:13.250
Marcus!

00:51.208 --> 00:53.208
Can we have a picture with Tété?

00:53.291 --> 00:54.625
Yeah, of course.

00:57.708 --> 01:00.041
I listened to your new track.

01:00.958 --> 01:03.041
It's bold.

01:03.125 --> 01:03.958
No.

01:05.041 --> 01:05.875
It's Marcus.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.125
Thanks, everyone.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.458
Marcus, the trophy.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.500
Sorry, excuse me.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.625
Babe, you're the best.

01:18.416 --> 01:20.583
Wonderful. He's wonderful.

01:20.666 --> 01:23.166
Mel?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.791
-Marcus?
-Great.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.458
Marcus, you're up.
Can you please follow me?

01:28.083 --> 01:30.583
Wait. I'll keep it. I'll hold on to it.

01:30.666 --> 01:33.000
You're the bomb. You're the king! Okay?

01:33.666 --> 01:35.000
He's the bomb.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.458
-I'm going back.
-I'll be right there.

01:37.541 --> 01:38.791
Pascal, what's up?

01:38.875 --> 01:40.833
You're missing out on the party.
We made it.

01:40.916 --> 01:43.500
<i>-Yeah, congrats.</i>
-It's awesome, right?

01:43.583 --> 01:44.875
<i>Didn't the lawyers call you?</i>

01:44.958 --> 01:46.208
Why? What's going on?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.791
<i>-Shit's hitting the fan!</i>
-What?

01:49.875 --> 01:51.541
<i>Marcus is being sued</i>

01:51.625 --> 01:54.833
<i>for insult and incitement</i>
<i>to violence against women.</i>

01:54.916 --> 01:56.958
<i>Holidays are over. You guys are a pain.</i>

01:58.875 --> 02:01.833
THREE MONTHS LATER

02:02.541 --> 02:03.791
MY BODY MY CHOICE
MACHO

02:07.500 --> 02:10.166
Marcus!

02:10.250 --> 02:11.333
SHAME ON YOU

02:11.416 --> 02:12.958
MARCUS DOOFUS

02:13.041 --> 02:15.041
Keep a low profile. Is that clear?

02:17.833 --> 02:19.583
Marcus, I love you!

02:19.666 --> 02:21.375
Settle down.

02:21.458 --> 02:22.333
Hello.

02:22.416 --> 02:23.833
You're all called Simone?

02:23.916 --> 02:25.458
No. My name is Lila.

02:26.083 --> 02:28.083
-I'm Alice.
-And I'm Jeanne.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.791
"Simones" comes from Simone de Beauvoir,
a major feminist figure.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.416
-Ring a bell?
-You're the teachers.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.291
We're not teachers. We're journalists.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.416
We want to talk with you.

02:40.500 --> 02:44.166
A 3,000-euro fine for insults
and incitement to violence against women.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.500
Is it a major defeat?

02:45.583 --> 02:49.041
There's such a thing as freedom of speech.

02:49.625 --> 02:50.791
We're going to appeal.

02:52.416 --> 02:55.166
Have you ever called a girl a slut?

02:55.250 --> 02:56.666
-No.
-Slut?

02:58.041 --> 02:59.208
No one? Really?

02:59.791 --> 03:01.041
What did you do on Snap?

03:01.125 --> 03:03.583
-I didn't say anything.
-Stop lying.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.625
She's showing her ass on socials.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.083
"They are all hoes except for her."

03:09.166 --> 03:12.291
"Where I come from, women shut up.
Only open their mouth for a blowjob."

03:12.375 --> 03:15.000
"I'm not going to wait for her 'yes.'
I only have one night."

03:15.083 --> 03:17.708
-Do you stand by this?
-Don't answer that.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.416
Keep it up, Marcus!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.333
Yeah. Why? You want copyrights?

03:21.416 --> 03:23.500
You don't see a problem with this?

03:23.583 --> 03:24.833
No! Hey!

03:24.916 --> 03:26.250
That's not the point.

03:26.333 --> 03:30.250
We want you to realize
that these insults aren't harmless.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.500
-Right.
-I mean…

03:31.583 --> 03:34.750
Nobody's forcing them.
It's like what Marcus said.

03:36.541 --> 03:37.875
What did Marcus say?

03:37.958 --> 03:38.791
This here.

03:40.375 --> 03:44.083
<i>They are all hoes except for her</i>
<i>Don't ask to see me again</i>

03:44.166 --> 03:47.958
<i>Where I come from, women shut up</i>
<i>Only open their mouth for a blowjob</i>

03:48.041 --> 03:49.541
<i>She and I are not the same</i>

03:49.625 --> 03:51.958
<i>We'll get different dough</i>
<i>Different jobs</i>

03:53.458 --> 03:55.916
<i>I put my problems into a grinder</i>

03:56.000 --> 03:57.416
<i>Her pussy is so fine</i>

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
<i>If she likes me too much</i>
<i>I won't give her the time of day</i>

03:59.583 --> 04:01.541
<i>If she's a bad lay</i>
<i>I won't give her the time of day</i>

04:02.333 --> 04:05.791
<i>I'm not going to wait for her "yes"</i>
<i>I only have one night</i>

04:06.416 --> 04:07.250
You're the best!

04:07.333 --> 04:09.375
We have something to write about.

04:12.125 --> 04:12.958
The best!

04:19.000 --> 04:20.541
What got into you, Marcus?

04:22.541 --> 04:26.541
A 3,000-euro fine isn't enough?
Let's hike up the bill with the reporters?

04:27.291 --> 04:28.833
I answered their question.

04:28.916 --> 04:32.458
-It's a rough patch. It'll blow over.
-Don't give me that!

04:33.708 --> 04:34.625
Not to Daddy!

04:36.250 --> 04:39.208
We lost seven cities.
Because of your bullshit.

04:39.791 --> 04:42.541
I'm talking 5,000-seat venues.
Ninety bucks a ticket.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.833
I'll let you do the math on the loss.

04:44.916 --> 04:47.791
Didn't you say
a little provocation boosts sales?

04:47.875 --> 04:49.125
That was way before.

04:50.416 --> 04:53.833
The bad boy, the princess.
That's reached its limits.

04:53.916 --> 04:56.875
With "Me Too"
and all their bullshit. Anyway…

04:56.958 --> 05:00.833
You're in deep shit. I won't drop you.
Bercy's a year from now.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.208
-The Arena.
-Yes, the Arena.

05:03.291 --> 05:04.125
So…

05:04.708 --> 05:07.625
We keep pushing
your relationship with Mel.

05:07.708 --> 05:11.916
But drawing a more family-friendly image.

05:12.625 --> 05:13.458
A dog?

05:14.125 --> 05:14.958
A dog…

05:15.750 --> 05:17.541
We need a clear artistic turn.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.291
Where's that turn headed?

05:21.291 --> 05:22.708
Right for Christmas.

05:23.625 --> 05:26.208
What? Hold on. You've lost me.

05:26.791 --> 05:29.916
For Christmas,
Marcus is singing his love for women.

05:30.708 --> 05:32.666
-You sure about this?
-It'll work.

05:32.750 --> 05:36.583
Goodbye to the misogynistic skirt-chaser.
Hello to the perfect son-in-law.

05:37.291 --> 05:38.250
So…

05:38.333 --> 05:42.125
We put the album out in a year,
at Christmas time. It's a hit.

05:42.208 --> 05:46.875
Two weeks later, you're on <i>The Voice Kids.</i>
We're going to normalize you.

05:46.958 --> 05:49.666
-Salvage your career.
-Yeah, all right.

05:51.041 --> 05:53.416
-Count me out.
-Marcus!

05:53.958 --> 05:55.458
He's pissing me off.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.333
You signed a contract.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.208
If you have a better solution
to redeem your public image…

06:09.833 --> 06:10.833
Why the long face?

06:11.416 --> 06:13.291
A Christmas album is
the sign of a great artist.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.541
Bob Dylan, Céline Dion,

06:15.625 --> 06:17.583
Mariah Carey, Snoop Dog…

06:17.666 --> 06:19.166
Even Johnny did it.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.708
Johnny wasn't a clown, was he?

06:25.375 --> 06:28.416
Hello, everyone.
Five years for The Simones.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.458
FIVE YEARS

06:29.541 --> 06:31.500
We're proud to have accomplished
so many missions

06:31.583 --> 06:32.416
with you.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.750
One is not born a Simone. One becomes one.

06:35.833 --> 06:39.208
We'd like to keep it that way.
That's why we need you.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.000
The Simones need you.

06:41.083 --> 06:45.208
We're launching a crowdfunding campaign.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.000
We're calling on your help

06:47.083 --> 06:49.250
so that the fight can go on.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.375
You support us. You love us.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.333
You clicked on our video.

06:53.416 --> 06:55.750
-You watched it till the end.
-Yes, you.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.708
SHARE

06:56.791 --> 06:58.125
You're going to share this video.

07:23.666 --> 07:27.500
It's beautiful. So beautiful, I love it!

07:28.333 --> 07:29.291
You okay, honey?

07:29.833 --> 07:31.583
Yeah, work stuff.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.375
Take a break. It's Christmas.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.666
It's magical.
It makes me want to do so much stuff.

07:36.750 --> 07:40.000
It's a hypocritical holiday.
It gives me a headache.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.166
You're such a downer.

07:42.250 --> 07:45.583
It brings me down
to see my sister bum herself out.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.250
You'll end up with cancer.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.958
Look at this. Is this normal?

07:50.625 --> 07:53.666
We're made to believe
we have be in a relationship to be happy.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.375
You can be single and be happy.
This is an insult to single people.

07:57.458 --> 08:00.583
Settle down, Miss Activist.
You're the insult.

08:00.666 --> 08:02.208
You don't use Tinder.

08:03.208 --> 08:07.458
-Not where I'll find the love of my life.
-Old fogy, give me your phone.

08:08.541 --> 08:09.375
Give it.

08:10.833 --> 08:14.958
-Christmas. Just what I needed.
-You're at your parents on the 25th?

08:15.041 --> 08:16.250
I'm out of excuses.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.291
I've tried them all,
video, showcase, concert…

08:19.375 --> 08:21.500
My mom's brought out the big guns.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.833
Yeah? What about your old man?

08:23.916 --> 08:27.541
Since I chose rap over college,
I'm a full-blown thug to him.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.166
-Yeah?
-And with the trial, you can imagine.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.166
That didn't change his mind? Weird, huh?

08:34.458 --> 08:35.666
-Him?
-Not very interesting.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.583
NO SUSHI, PLZ!

08:36.666 --> 08:39.208
Butt-ugly. Check out those funky frames.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.333
How is this for Mom?

08:41.416 --> 08:43.083
There you go!

08:43.166 --> 08:44.916
Etienne, tech entrepreneur!

08:45.000 --> 08:46.125
MUTUAL RESPECT AND EQUALITY

08:46.708 --> 08:47.750
No way!

08:48.541 --> 08:49.875
-What?
-No way, girl!

08:49.958 --> 08:52.125
-A fucking grand slam!
-Spit it out.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.791
He likes the same movies and books as you.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.125
His favorite sports? Surfing and yoga.

08:58.583 --> 09:01.375
Let's go, click clock. It's done.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.625
-What?
-Tomorrow evening, 8 p.m. Café des Anges.

09:04.416 --> 09:05.625
-What?
-He said yes!

09:05.708 --> 09:07.958
I'll thank myself at your wedding.

09:08.041 --> 09:10.333
You're a pain. Why did you do that?

09:10.416 --> 09:14.166
I forgot something for Mom.
Don't wait up for me, doll.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.958
Etienne at the Café des Anges…

09:18.750 --> 09:20.375
-I hate you.
-I love you!

09:21.375 --> 09:22.625
Merry Christmas!

09:22.708 --> 09:23.625
Fucking hell.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.833
-How's this for Mom?
-Nice. Salmon pink.

09:27.916 --> 09:29.291
Excuse me. Are you…

09:29.375 --> 09:30.500
Yeah. You are…

09:32.333 --> 09:34.250
It's me. You can call me Marcus.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.041
-Can we take a picture?
-Yeah.

09:39.916 --> 09:40.750
Thanks.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.000
-You're welcome.
-Bye.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.833
I like it. It's nice.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.166
Would it be possible to take a selfie?

09:47.625 --> 09:49.958
-Thanks. Merry Christmas.
-Thanks. Bye.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.250
Let go of me.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.958
I didn't take anything.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.916
-Come with me.
-Let go of me.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.291
Show me your pockets.

10:01.375 --> 10:03.083
Sir, what are you doing?

10:03.166 --> 10:07.041
-Sir, why are you shoving her around?
-Please, I'm doing my job.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.583
You're hurting her!

10:08.666 --> 10:10.541
It's not your job to hurt her.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.583
-I don't have anything!
-Come.

10:12.666 --> 10:15.916
Sir, you're hurting her! Let her go!

10:17.791 --> 10:19.750
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.458
What's going on here?

10:26.541 --> 10:28.875
There's a singer, I think. Marius…

10:28.958 --> 10:30.541
-Marcus?
-Yes, that's it.

10:30.625 --> 10:32.416
People are crazy, right?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.416
I can't believe it. It's Marcus.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.958
Marcus!

10:39.041 --> 10:39.958
Marcus!

10:42.375 --> 10:44.791
Settle down! Everyone will get their pic!

10:46.250 --> 10:49.291
It's shameful what you say in your songs!

10:49.375 --> 10:51.833
-Don't listen to them.
-Young people do!

10:51.916 --> 10:54.000
You have a responsibility
towards the youth!

10:54.083 --> 10:56.875
-Why don't you say anything?
-Okay, settle down!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.375
This way! Here!

11:01.125 --> 11:01.958
Here!

11:12.166 --> 11:13.208
It's lovely here.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.208
Very cute.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.500
Did you decorate it?

11:18.458 --> 11:19.500
You listen to me.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.833
Save the wisecracks for the cops.

11:23.958 --> 11:25.833
Okay. Copy. Be right there.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.625
Don't move. I'll be back.

11:34.833 --> 11:35.666
Fuck.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.583
This way.

11:38.083 --> 11:42.583
-You'll have some peace and quiet.
-Is this where the KGB questioned people?

11:43.916 --> 11:45.708
-I'll catch up with you.
-Yeah.

11:46.458 --> 11:47.291
Hello?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.958
It's austere but quiet. This way.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.875
-Next door on your right.
-Thanks.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.708
Hi.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.375
Hello.

12:02.583 --> 12:06.333
-I was told to wait here. Won't be long.
-No problem.

12:06.416 --> 12:08.625
I'm waiting for the cops anyway.

12:08.708 --> 12:11.041
Okay. I'm waiting for my Uber.

12:13.083 --> 12:16.041
Similar. Just not the same destination.

12:16.625 --> 12:17.541
No.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.458
The cops don't let me play music.

12:19.541 --> 12:21.583
I hope you gave them a bad rating.

12:34.125 --> 12:34.958
Fancy a drink?

12:36.291 --> 12:37.208
A drink of water.

12:38.916 --> 12:41.083
I was thinking, that's a bold move.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.750
The guy doesn't fear much.

12:43.375 --> 12:44.458
I don't fear much.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.333
All right.

12:47.083 --> 12:47.916
Okay.

12:52.375 --> 12:53.208
Thanks.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.250
So what do you do?

12:59.333 --> 13:02.958
Aside from waiting for cops.
In a basement. On Christmas Eve.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.666
I'm a journalist.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.500
Cool. Journalist.

13:09.291 --> 13:10.833
-For whom?
-For no one.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.541
-I'm my own boss.
-Okay.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.291
My friends and I created a digital media.
The Simones.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.875
-The Simones? Never heard of it.
-Yeah.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.375
You're not the only one.

13:20.791 --> 13:23.875
That's the issue.
We're not sure we'll make it past winter.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.541
Anyway, what do you do?

13:28.625 --> 13:32.125
Aside from waiting for Ubers
in basements on Christmas Eve?

13:36.250 --> 13:37.250
I make music.

13:38.708 --> 13:41.375
Lately, I've just been screwing up a lot.

13:42.458 --> 13:43.375
I mean…

13:44.500 --> 13:45.333
Marcus?

13:46.333 --> 13:48.541
Sorry. The taxi's waiting. Let's go.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.125
Be right there.

13:52.750 --> 13:53.958
Marcus…

13:55.708 --> 13:57.291
I can get you out of here.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.666
A word to the manager. Done.

14:00.750 --> 14:01.958
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.125
I'll take you out for a real drink.

14:05.416 --> 14:06.291
Not water.

14:07.708 --> 14:10.541
No, thanks, Marcus. I can manage.

14:11.208 --> 14:15.250
I know who I'm dealing with.
I know about your songs, your videos…

14:15.333 --> 14:16.833
Your trial too.

14:17.416 --> 14:18.916
We wrote an article about you.

14:19.416 --> 14:22.083
Read it.
You'll see how highly I think of you.

14:23.541 --> 14:24.833
An article?

14:26.750 --> 14:28.416
On your website no one cares about?

14:30.333 --> 14:31.791
Anyway. Okay.

14:33.791 --> 14:37.583
Bye, Miss Reporter.
Say hi to the cops. Merry Christmas.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.666
Fuck. Marcus.

14:49.541 --> 14:50.583
Fuck.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.208
<i>This sucks.</i>

14:55.291 --> 14:56.958
<i>It sucks to talk about the trial.</i>

14:57.041 --> 14:58.500
MARCUS, THE JUDGES, THE WHORES AND US

14:58.583 --> 15:01.083
<i>It's talking about the song</i>
<i>and giving it publicity.</i>

15:01.166 --> 15:03.125
<i>We'd rather not talk about it.</i>

15:03.208 --> 15:06.125
<i>As if it didn't exist. It shouldn't exist.</i>

15:07.083 --> 15:07.958
What's up?

15:08.041 --> 15:08.875
What?

15:09.583 --> 15:12.541
I know when something's up.
What's on your mind?

15:14.375 --> 15:17.291
-I need to invest, man.
-Do you? In what?

15:17.375 --> 15:20.041
-In a feminist media.
-What?

15:20.125 --> 15:22.125
<i>…listened to by young people</i>

15:22.208 --> 15:25.500
<i>has nothing better to do</i>
<i>than calling all women whores.</i>

15:25.583 --> 15:27.833
-What am I looking at?
-The Simones.

15:27.916 --> 15:29.375
The girl from earlier.

15:29.458 --> 15:32.708
They're seriously broke.
This close to shutting down.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.458
They also hate your guts.

15:35.541 --> 15:39.041
-You read the article?
-Exactly. This will prove them wrong.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.041
And it redeems my public image.

15:43.291 --> 15:46.833
-Is it a good idea?
-You said, "Don't let your money sleep."

15:46.916 --> 15:48.708
Yeah. For proper investments.

15:48.791 --> 15:50.000
-This here--
-What?

15:50.083 --> 15:53.416
It's my way of avoiding
that lousy album. Let's do this.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.166
-Come on.
-Okay. I'll look into it.

15:56.916 --> 15:59.083
You'll need to stay anonymous.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.000
They'll never agree to it.

16:01.541 --> 16:04.750
If we were to go
through an investment fund, then…

16:06.333 --> 16:07.166
Maybe.

16:09.166 --> 16:12.916
It's Zack. Marcus and I were thinking
about an opportunity.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.708
A feminist media.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.708
Yeah. Sounds good, right?

16:30.958 --> 16:33.000
<i>-What a day.</i>
<i>-Should we order?</i>

16:33.083 --> 16:35.000
-Yeah. What do you want?
-Burger?

16:35.083 --> 16:36.708
You're putting on weight.

16:36.791 --> 16:38.958
-Pizza, then?
-Seriously…

16:39.041 --> 16:40.375
That's good stuff.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.083
Tada!

16:47.000 --> 16:48.208
Christmas

16:48.291 --> 16:49.208
family

16:50.083 --> 16:51.000
spirit.

16:51.791 --> 16:52.625
Okay.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.958
-Is something wrong?
-No, darling. It's…

16:58.625 --> 17:00.791
It's just that it looks as if…

17:00.875 --> 17:03.083
As if Santa Claus barfed in a corner.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.458
-Yeah.
-You guys are idiots.

17:05.541 --> 17:08.750
That's for the fans.
The camera shot for tomorrow's stream.

17:08.833 --> 17:11.291
I meant the dog. Brilliant idea or what?

17:11.375 --> 17:13.041
Look. What do you think?

17:14.625 --> 17:15.458
Hairy.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.291
-Did you find any presents?
-I just found a little…

17:20.875 --> 17:21.708
No.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.166
What?

17:29.333 --> 17:31.958
I was with the Prime Minister
this morning.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.166
We need to save the printed press.
Any ideas?

17:35.666 --> 17:36.875
-No.
-Me neither.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.000
Brune Giordano. Nice to meet you.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.291
-Nice to meet you.
-Straight to the point.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.583
I'm on board to buy the-simones.org.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.625
-We'll save your website.
-Really?

17:46.291 --> 17:48.041
To invest. Not to buy.

17:48.916 --> 17:51.708
We're the largest online media in France.

17:51.791 --> 17:53.583
We have titles for everyone.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.375
From young liberal bohos to army vets,

17:56.458 --> 17:58.333
cooks, hypochondriacs,

17:58.416 --> 18:01.750
children under three, and even pets.

18:01.833 --> 18:03.750
Woof-woof.com. Ever heard of it?

18:04.583 --> 18:05.708
No…

18:05.791 --> 18:08.166
Basically, everyone. Except you.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.416
-Me?
-No, you feminists.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.750
What do you mean, us?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.833
-Aren't you one?
-It's not the same.

18:14.916 --> 18:17.750
I love your grassroots approach
to digital media.

18:17.833 --> 18:21.541
You're genuine field reporters.
Great positioning.

18:21.625 --> 18:22.708
Very contemporary.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.666
But you'll have to adjust somewhat.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.375
Adjust on what level?

18:29.458 --> 18:33.083
Your videos are wonderful.
The website isn't profitable.

18:33.166 --> 18:35.250
Fear not! We have some ideas.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.958
Partnership with brands, for instance.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.875
Or a new name. That's important.

18:42.541 --> 18:43.750
"Girl Power."

18:43.833 --> 18:45.666
-Nice.
-Sounds great.

18:46.958 --> 18:48.458
"Womenista."

18:49.041 --> 18:50.791
Womenista! Amazing!

18:50.875 --> 18:52.708
We love it!

18:56.625 --> 18:58.833
In terms of partnership, what brands?

18:58.916 --> 19:00.625
No shortage of girls' brands.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.125
Are you seriously considering this?

19:05.208 --> 19:08.750
No choice.
We're not going to make this month's rent.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.333
We'll find a way.

19:10.416 --> 19:13.625
You can make up for late rent,
not for shitting on your principles.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.291
You okay?

19:15.375 --> 19:17.708
Yes. We're passionate activists.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.500
It's sort of what defines us.

19:20.875 --> 19:24.041
Can we hear her out
before we start losing it?

19:24.125 --> 19:26.208
I can't speak my mind, is that it?

19:26.291 --> 19:29.541
You're behaving like a sociopath.
Two different things.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.000
So stop it.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.375
Fine. I'll stop. You have fun.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.041
Goodbye.

19:41.541 --> 19:43.000
The fight continues!

19:44.833 --> 19:47.250
-She has an appointment.
-You're sweet.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.041
Come back when you all agree.

19:51.041 --> 19:53.625
After graduating, I traveled around.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.833
I wanted to discover other cultures.

19:55.916 --> 19:56.750
SO? IT'S A MATCH?

19:56.833 --> 19:59.000
Find out what I wanted to do with my life.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.250
You think that's weird?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.291
What is?

20:02.375 --> 20:03.875
No, not at all.

20:05.416 --> 20:08.250
What's the problem?
I can tell you're not here.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.500
I didn't want to come.

20:10.583 --> 20:13.416
-Come where?
-Well, here.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.750
On this date.

20:14.833 --> 20:15.708
Okay!

20:17.125 --> 20:19.041
You're straightforward.

20:19.125 --> 20:20.916
Don't worry. It's fine. Go on.

20:22.916 --> 20:24.416
Actually, it's my sister

20:24.500 --> 20:26.291
who made me come here tonight.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.708
She forced me, really.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.708
This keeps getting better. Go on.

20:30.791 --> 20:31.666
I swear.

20:31.750 --> 20:34.250
You should take it as a compliment.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.458
She thought you were totally hot.

20:36.541 --> 20:38.166
That's why I'm here.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.166
Why not give me her number?

20:40.250 --> 20:42.833
I'll have dinner with her.
Everyone's happy.

20:44.625 --> 20:47.666
Yeah. You're great, really. Perfect.

20:48.541 --> 20:49.416
-I…
-But?

20:51.375 --> 20:52.708
But I don't need this.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.041
Don't need this?

20:55.125 --> 20:56.583
You mean a boyfriend?

20:59.083 --> 21:00.916
BREAKING NEWS
COME OVER!

21:02.166 --> 21:03.416
Sorry. I have to go.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.833
All right. Go ahead.

21:05.625 --> 21:08.541
-You're not upset?
-No. Thanks for your honesty.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.333
I know we'll see each other again.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.291
I can feel it.

21:16.333 --> 21:17.208
Okay.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.458
Well. Right. Bye.

21:19.541 --> 21:20.375
Bye.

21:37.708 --> 21:38.541
There!

21:38.625 --> 21:41.083
MALALA YOUSAFZAI STREET

21:41.166 --> 21:42.333
Yousafzai…

21:43.416 --> 21:45.833
Perfect. That's cool. Alice, look.

21:47.125 --> 21:47.958
Alice?

21:50.750 --> 21:52.750
Sorry. Have you seen Alice?

21:52.833 --> 21:54.208
Alice is right there.

21:55.875 --> 21:58.041
-Hey? Alice?
-What?

21:58.125 --> 21:59.583
Are we bothering you?

21:59.666 --> 22:02.041
What? Mathias came to help.

22:02.125 --> 22:03.958
-Mathis.
-That's what I said.

22:04.041 --> 22:05.958
I was filling him in on context.

22:07.291 --> 22:10.041
I saw that.
Your filling-in was very thorough.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.750
With tongue and all.
Really, I'm impressed.

22:12.833 --> 22:16.541
Can you tell her?
Jeanne suffers from severe skepticism.

22:16.625 --> 22:19.541
-It's a chronic condition.
-Yeah, sure thing.

22:19.625 --> 22:23.083
I didn't know that only 2%
of Paris streets were named after women.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.291
-Yeah.
-The mayor…

22:24.375 --> 22:27.083
The mayor's office won't take action. And…

22:27.666 --> 22:29.958
-It's revolting.
-Revolting.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.083
That's true. It's shameful.

22:32.166 --> 22:33.666
It is shameful.

22:33.750 --> 22:34.916
So?

22:36.416 --> 22:38.291
He can start wheatpasting.

22:38.375 --> 22:39.875
-Here.
-Start pasting.

22:39.958 --> 22:43.166
-Where were you?
-Who cares? What's the news?

22:43.250 --> 22:44.708
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.291
We found an investor. A Christmas miracle.

22:47.375 --> 22:50.125
Don't get too excited.
We don't know who it is.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.375
So what?

22:51.458 --> 22:53.833
It's weird to want to remain secret.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.500
It's honorable to stand up
for a cause anonymously.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.583
You say secret, but I hear quiet.

22:59.666 --> 23:01.875
They'll stay off our backs.

23:01.958 --> 23:05.000
Is it possible?
No name on the check? No info?

23:05.083 --> 23:06.875
I asked the lawyer. It's okay.

23:06.958 --> 23:10.833
It's an investment fund.
This guy could be anyone.

23:10.916 --> 23:12.250
Or this chick.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.958
You tell her why this is a good thing.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.541
It's no strings attached?

23:16.625 --> 23:19.250
Kind of like a benefactor.
We're independent.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.416
That's great. This is our chance.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.583
Honestly, Jeannot,
if we don't say yes, we're done.

23:24.666 --> 23:26.041
We don't have a choice.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.000
-We don't have a choice.
-No.

23:28.083 --> 23:30.666
-We don't have a choice.
-The cops!

23:30.750 --> 23:31.625
Run!

23:33.666 --> 23:35.000
Hurry! Run!

23:35.083 --> 23:36.208
Girls! Wait for me!

23:40.125 --> 23:40.958
Alice!

23:43.666 --> 23:44.500
Girls!

23:52.291 --> 23:55.416
With this framing, I think it's perfect.

23:57.208 --> 23:58.916
Sweetheart, we'll stand here.

24:00.083 --> 24:00.916
Like this.

24:02.750 --> 24:03.583
Right, babe?

24:05.458 --> 24:06.291
Marcus?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Marcus!

24:12.083 --> 24:13.291
Yeah, babe, coming.

24:13.375 --> 24:18.583
All good. I talked to your Simone.
I'll send a courier to swap gifts.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.083
No. I'll do it.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.708
You have other things to be doing.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.583
-It'll get me out of the house.
-She can't know you're the investor.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.875
You keep it shut.

24:29.291 --> 24:30.291
Calm down.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.375
It's cool. Don't sweat it.

24:31.458 --> 24:34.208
Go see your parents. Give them my best.

24:34.291 --> 24:37.166
I'll be back in an hour
for our Christmas live.

24:37.250 --> 24:38.875
Finally, some enthusiasm!

24:38.958 --> 24:40.166
It's about time.

24:40.250 --> 24:41.791
One hour, babe.

24:42.625 --> 24:43.958
Is he leaving?

24:44.750 --> 24:45.666
You're leaving?

24:46.916 --> 24:48.041
I can't believe it.

24:48.958 --> 24:52.916
We're streaming live in two hours.
No one's saying anything!

24:53.500 --> 24:54.416
Fuck.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.416
I mean, seriously?

25:00.375 --> 25:01.208
Thanks.

25:05.708 --> 25:07.500
Guys! It's Marcus!

25:07.583 --> 25:08.750
No way!

25:09.416 --> 25:10.791
What's up?

25:10.875 --> 25:12.583
-Can we take a picture?
-Quickly.

25:12.666 --> 25:13.500
You rule.

25:14.666 --> 25:16.916
You're so dope. Let me get the others.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.041
-No, buddy. No.
-Please.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.750
Here. You didn't see me.

25:21.833 --> 25:24.333
-You're the man.
-Come back here!

25:25.041 --> 25:25.875
It's here.

25:26.708 --> 25:30.666
It's no big deal to wet your bed.
It happens to everyone.

25:30.750 --> 25:34.291
It happened to me
at camp, after giving birth.

25:34.375 --> 25:35.708
-We get it.
-You don't.

25:35.791 --> 25:39.875
Did you see the size
of your skull when you were born?

25:40.458 --> 25:41.875
-It's Marcus.
-What?

25:49.125 --> 25:50.833
I'm coming! All right!

25:50.916 --> 25:52.000
What's with you?

25:53.708 --> 25:56.416
-What's going on?
-Marcus. Pee. E.T.

25:57.041 --> 25:58.375
Did she have a stroke?

25:58.458 --> 26:00.166
I'm going to my room now.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.958
What's with you too?

26:02.916 --> 26:05.666
Chill out! She's insane.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.500
I didn't mean to intrude.

26:09.583 --> 26:11.333
Are you selling calendars?

26:11.416 --> 26:13.291
-Would you buy some?
-No.

26:13.375 --> 26:15.625
No calendars but I have your present.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.083
-No courier?
-It's Christmas.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.250
-Couriers have families too.
-Right.

26:20.791 --> 26:22.125
Thank you. Good night.

26:23.041 --> 26:24.333
-Wait.
-What?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.708
What's your beef?

26:26.708 --> 26:28.583
You're in love and don't want to admit it.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.250
-What a pain.
-Who is this charming man?

26:31.333 --> 26:34.166
-No one, Mom.
-You can at least introduce us.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.708
Hello, madam. Marcus.

26:35.791 --> 26:38.791
Danièle. Nice to meet you. I'm Lila's mom.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.833
-Safia.
-Nice to meet you.

26:42.291 --> 26:44.250
Don't just stand there. Come in.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.958
-I don't want to intrude.
-He was leaving.

26:47.041 --> 26:49.250
No.

26:49.333 --> 26:50.291
No way.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.166
In ancient times,

26:53.250 --> 26:56.041
the Greeks had to offer hospitality

26:56.125 --> 27:00.291
because an unknown visitor
could be a god disguised as a human.

27:00.375 --> 27:01.583
I love that story.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.166
So do I.

27:03.250 --> 27:05.125
Come inside.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.875
You might be Hephaestus. The god of fire.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.458
Or Apollo.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.666
After all, it's Christmas.

27:19.250 --> 27:20.208
They're too big.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.166
I'm sorry. I'll fix it.

27:24.791 --> 27:28.500
-Have you known each other for long?
-No, not really.

27:29.291 --> 27:30.291
We clicked.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.458
Marcus has better things to do
than to be questioned.

27:34.541 --> 27:36.666
No. It's all right. I like it.

27:37.750 --> 27:40.041
Hope he's more gifted
in the sack than in the kitchen.

27:40.125 --> 27:41.791
-We're not together.
-Good.

27:41.875 --> 27:44.958
-The guy has two left hands.
-True. I'm not gifted.

27:45.041 --> 27:47.250
At home, my mom does everything.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.416
Right. Surprising.

27:49.791 --> 27:51.791
You still kind of like each other.

27:51.875 --> 27:54.541
-Stop it. Enough.
-Lila, can I speak with you?

27:57.958 --> 27:59.916
-What?
-Did you notice?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.916
Marcus is totally into me.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
I hadn't.

28:03.083 --> 28:05.875
He's looking at me
with his eyes in an intense way.

28:05.958 --> 28:07.833
Looking at you with his eyes?

28:07.916 --> 28:11.041
In the staircase,
there were crazy erotic vibes.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.750
Before or after
the bit about incontinence?

28:13.833 --> 28:15.083
Laugh all you want.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.041
We're already super close.

28:17.125 --> 28:19.041
Yes, that's true.

28:19.125 --> 28:22.375
Hold on.
You're blowing my mind. Slow down.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.958
Twice in two days. I'm in <i>Notting Hill.</i>

28:25.041 --> 28:26.583
It's romantic. Christmas…

28:26.666 --> 28:29.541
I'm sick of this open-house Christmas.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.083
-Merry Christmas!
-Thanks for having me.

28:34.166 --> 28:37.666
I can't count on my alter-globalist family
to plan anything.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.750
-Sure. How are you?
-Thanks.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.291
Hey! Merry Christmas, girls!

28:42.375 --> 28:44.250
Presents. Champagne. Christmas.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.583
-Who is this?
-Daniel. The third-floor neighbor.

28:52.833 --> 28:55.291
-He's making himself at home.
-Quite.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.916
-Your mom's new boyfriend?
-Come on.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
No way.

28:59.083 --> 29:00.291
Daniel, sweetheart!

29:00.375 --> 29:01.750
My love!

29:03.291 --> 29:06.291
No. Daniel and Danièle. It's legendary.

29:07.875 --> 29:09.083
You big fool!

29:09.166 --> 29:12.750
Am I hallucinating
or is France's most misogynistic rapper

29:12.833 --> 29:15.875
looking at family pictures with your mom?

29:15.958 --> 29:19.625
-He's looking at what?
-Not the most shocking bit.

29:19.708 --> 29:22.666
-…in the bathtub.
-Enough with the show-and-tell.

29:22.750 --> 29:28.208
My daughter is very reserved.
It became pathological after Hassan left.

29:28.791 --> 29:30.833
-Hassan?
-Her father.

29:30.916 --> 29:34.000
He up and left one Christmas Eve
when she was 12.

29:34.083 --> 29:36.791
She thinks it's her fault, although…

29:36.875 --> 29:39.541
-Everyone knows whose fault it is.
-Stop now!

29:40.291 --> 29:42.375
You're telling our life story
to a stranger.

29:42.458 --> 29:43.833
He's not a stranger.

29:44.708 --> 29:46.208
-What's his name?
-Marcus.

29:46.291 --> 29:48.791
Most importantly, he's our guest.

29:48.875 --> 29:51.166
-He's spending Christmas with us.
-No.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.416
You don't know him. He's a misogynist.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.291
It's getting late.
I'm going to catch an Uber.

29:58.375 --> 30:00.083
He's lovely. You're lovely.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.833
No. He's not lovely at all.

30:01.916 --> 30:03.333
-That's very kind.
-Stay!

30:04.083 --> 30:06.958
-Enough of her preconceived notions.
-You heard his songs?

30:08.333 --> 30:10.916
You've been going on about your WLM years.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.708
So much for burning your bra.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.791
-Marcos. Is this true?
-Marcus. It's false.

30:16.958 --> 30:17.875
Well, it's art.

30:18.541 --> 30:21.125
I convey images that can be shocking.

30:21.208 --> 30:24.458
Let's say I have
a somewhat more traditional view.

30:26.000 --> 30:26.958
Traditional…

30:27.541 --> 30:29.083
-Traditional?
-Yeah.

30:29.625 --> 30:32.458
-Are you a misogynist or are you not?
-No.

30:32.541 --> 30:33.416
Not at all.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.416
What do the songs say? I don't get it.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.875
-You want to know?
-Yes.

30:40.000 --> 30:40.833
Here.

30:43.250 --> 30:45.041
"I'm not going to pray for frame."

30:45.125 --> 30:46.250
-Fame.
-What?

30:46.333 --> 30:47.541
It means "glory."

30:48.125 --> 30:49.541
"They're all hoes except for her."

30:50.125 --> 30:51.291
I see.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.666
-It's…
-It's art.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.541
"Where I come from, women shut up."

30:55.416 --> 30:58.083
"I'm not going to wait for her 'yes.'
I only have one night."

30:58.875 --> 31:00.250
All right. It's…

31:00.958 --> 31:03.625
-It's quite…
-Artistic.

31:03.708 --> 31:04.833
Yes, I mean…

31:06.208 --> 31:09.375
-You've gone off the deep end.
-Grandma, it's not…

31:10.375 --> 31:12.166
Get out!

31:15.875 --> 31:17.666
-I forgot my--
-You forgot this!

31:18.541 --> 31:19.541
Merry Christmas!

31:26.958 --> 31:29.916
I did tons of songs
where I was nice to girls. I…

31:32.333 --> 31:33.541
<i>-Yeah?</i>
-What are you doing?

31:33.625 --> 31:34.791
I'm on my way.

31:34.875 --> 31:37.125
Mel is furious. You stood her up.

31:37.208 --> 31:38.250
I'm on my way.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.208
The driver's calling.

31:41.416 --> 31:44.291
-Hello?
<i>-This is your driver. I can't come near.</i>

31:44.375 --> 31:46.166
-What protest?
<i>-Not sure. Kids.</i>

31:56.166 --> 31:57.041
Damn it.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.416
-Hello?
<i>-How's your Christmas dinner going?</i>

32:01.125 --> 32:04.375
My uncle is about to finish off
the second bottle.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.000
They'll be quarreling anytime now.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.083
<i>-Why?</i>
-You have to come pick me up.

32:08.166 --> 32:10.166
Hurry. It's <i>The Walking Dead</i> here.

32:10.250 --> 32:11.083
On my way.

32:28.583 --> 32:29.791
Who is it this time?

32:31.500 --> 32:32.333
What?

32:33.875 --> 32:36.708
-You came back for more? Grandma!
-Let me hide.

32:36.791 --> 32:41.083
-They're downstairs. I'm a dead man.
-Poor baby. Again with the selfies.

32:42.041 --> 32:42.875
Grandma!

32:43.500 --> 32:45.041
-What are you doing?
-Look.

32:46.000 --> 32:46.833
What?

32:50.541 --> 32:51.625
-Not bad.
-You see.

32:51.708 --> 32:52.666
Look! He's here!

32:56.333 --> 32:57.666
What's wrong with you?

32:58.541 --> 33:01.291
-What are you doing?
-I was coming to get you.

33:01.375 --> 33:05.000
-You lovebirds. I have something to say.
-We're not lovebirds!

33:07.000 --> 33:09.041
-Go with Mommy.
-Come here.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.750
-Marcos, you sit here.
-Marcus.

33:11.833 --> 33:13.541
Next to Mom. She won't bite.

33:14.791 --> 33:16.166
-There.
-Hello again.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.500
-Still here?
-His groupies are outside.

33:18.583 --> 33:20.750
-He can't go.
-I have an announcement to make.

33:24.208 --> 33:26.375
I have asked Daniel to marry me.

33:26.458 --> 33:28.750
Naturally, well, I said yes.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.833
We'll marry in the spring.

33:30.916 --> 33:34.083
In time for the cherry trees
to be in bloom.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.541
That way it's more poetic. That's it.

33:37.125 --> 33:38.750
That's awesome! I love it.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.333
Amazing.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.500
-Here's something else.
-Said it.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.958
-I'm so happy.
-So am I.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.208
You have a new dad.

33:52.083 --> 33:54.000
Thank you all for welcoming me.

33:54.083 --> 33:56.666
There's nothing to understand.
We love each other.

33:57.541 --> 34:00.791
-He's perfect.
-Isn't he a tad too much of an alcoholic?

34:00.875 --> 34:02.875
Look who's talking now.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.500
He likes to party.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.875
That's what I love about him.
He's full of life.

34:06.958 --> 34:09.500
He could be
the perfect man or Barack Obama.

34:09.583 --> 34:11.916
-That's not the issue.
-What, then?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.791
You can't make such a decision
on your own. Announce it this way.

34:15.875 --> 34:18.166
Was I supposed to ask for your permission?

34:18.250 --> 34:20.041
Not on Christmas Eve, for one.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.250
Wouldn't that bring back memories?

34:23.125 --> 34:24.666
Is it a new tradition?

34:24.750 --> 34:28.125
We tear apart the family foundations
on December 24th!

34:28.208 --> 34:31.041
Everything doesn't revolve around you.

34:31.125 --> 34:34.291
Your father left me too.
I have the right to move on.

34:35.125 --> 34:36.166
It didn't stop him.

34:36.250 --> 34:39.083
You refuse to be happy.
Not everyone has to do the same.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.708
Mom, let's not go down that road.

34:41.791 --> 34:44.000
No. Hold on. I refuse to be happy?

34:44.083 --> 34:46.166
I saw them go by, all those boys.

34:46.250 --> 34:50.250
Nice as heck, all crazy about you.
You seemed very happy with them.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.916
You always send them packing
for no reason.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.625
-Right?
-No…

34:54.708 --> 34:57.583
This is my business. What do you know?

34:57.666 --> 35:02.000
-Since when do you have to have a man?
-Stop lecturing everyone, please.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.875
In my day, we didn't care what others did.

35:04.958 --> 35:06.375
We had the sex life we wanted.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.166
Do you think
we give a fuck who you sleep with?

35:09.250 --> 35:10.541
We don't care.

35:10.625 --> 35:14.958
Mom, all we're asking
is that you don't marry some random guy.

35:15.041 --> 35:17.583
He's not a random guy. He's our neighbor.

35:17.666 --> 35:19.916
He satisfies all my needs.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.166
Do you have any other hobbies?

35:22.250 --> 35:24.083
Aside from dating the neighbor?

35:24.166 --> 35:28.291
Yes, I'm a fan of hiking.
I love hiking. I…

35:28.375 --> 35:31.708
No one ever made me come like Daniel!

35:31.791 --> 35:33.250
He's a pleasure machine!

35:33.333 --> 35:35.333
-It never stops!
-And you, Grandma?

35:35.416 --> 35:37.916
You like the mountains? Ever been hiking?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.333
I've lost my appetite.

35:39.416 --> 35:41.708
Don't be upset! Here we go.

35:42.333 --> 35:44.916
-Let's call a spade, a spade. Sex matters!
-I'll go.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.500
I just couldn't stop coming!
One time, two times, ten times!

35:50.750 --> 35:51.833
Kids, right!

35:52.708 --> 35:53.541
Thanks.

36:04.541 --> 36:05.625
Is this your room?

36:19.375 --> 36:20.875
You're a romantic girl.

36:25.416 --> 36:26.625
That's a lot of CDs!

36:28.166 --> 36:29.000
Crazy.

36:34.458 --> 36:37.666
-Your family always like this?
-You don't like it?

36:37.750 --> 36:41.583
Sure. On the contrary.
Nice to see a family that communicates.

36:43.791 --> 36:45.041
Mine isn't like that.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.541
Actually, nobody at home shares anything.

37:00.291 --> 37:02.625
All right… Shall we call a truce?

37:03.750 --> 37:04.958
What kind of truce?

37:05.541 --> 37:08.625
Do you have any cigs?
Want to get some air? I need it.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.166
Sounds good to me.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.458
I can't go downstairs.
The whole neighborhood's there.

37:14.500 --> 37:18.500
Stop bragging. That's a quarter
of the neighborhood at most.

37:18.583 --> 37:20.708
And second, I never said downstairs.

37:35.958 --> 37:38.666
-This is where you'd bring boys.
-Are you nuts?

37:40.750 --> 37:43.125
I had better things to do
with Alice and Jeanne.

37:44.291 --> 37:45.791
We had to change the world.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.416
We came up with The Simones here.

37:54.875 --> 37:58.833
You might find it stupid,
but it's easier to dream when you go high.

38:04.875 --> 38:06.250
I don't find it stupid.

38:15.375 --> 38:16.250
Yeah, here.

38:26.083 --> 38:27.083
Why are you here?

38:28.916 --> 38:30.041
I brought your bag.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.541
You don't remember? The mall.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.791
-I took the wrong bag.
-Stop it with the bags.

38:36.458 --> 38:38.666
Why are you at my mom's on Christmas Eve?

38:39.291 --> 38:43.000
I mean, we're total strangers
and total opposites.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.958
-We don't belong together.
-Are you sure?

38:50.583 --> 38:51.416
What?

38:53.875 --> 38:55.208
You wanna hook up with me?

38:55.291 --> 38:57.375
-Not in a million years!
-You do!

38:57.458 --> 38:59.791
Someone looks at you,
they want to hook up with you?

38:59.875 --> 39:02.416
-Bullshit.
-Marcus wants to hook up with me!

39:02.500 --> 39:06.208
Guys! Marcus wants to hook up with me!

39:06.291 --> 39:08.000
-You do!
-Whatever.

39:08.083 --> 39:08.958
-Yes.
-No way.

39:09.041 --> 39:13.541
Marcus wants to hook up with me.
I can't believe it.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.041
I'll go, Danièle.

39:18.125 --> 39:19.041
-Hello.
-Yes?

39:23.625 --> 39:24.625
Can I help you?

39:25.875 --> 39:27.541
It's yeah… Because…

39:27.625 --> 39:28.500
I…

39:28.583 --> 39:30.375
There's… The…

39:31.041 --> 39:32.625
Sorry. I don't understand.

39:32.708 --> 39:34.083
Neither do I.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.625
-Who's this?
-Don't know. He's weird.

39:38.166 --> 39:41.666
Are you with an organization?
Selling calendars?

39:41.750 --> 39:43.666
No. I've come to pick up Marcus.

39:44.333 --> 39:45.875
And your number, if I can.

39:45.958 --> 39:47.166
I'm his manager.

39:47.958 --> 39:49.875
-Come in.
-Thank you very much.

39:49.958 --> 39:51.708
-Thank you.
-Come in.

39:52.416 --> 39:53.583
In ancient times,

39:54.291 --> 39:56.125
the Greeks had to…

39:57.916 --> 39:59.916
You still haven't said why you're here.

40:02.416 --> 40:05.416
Let's say that
I wanted to finish our conversation.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.375
-Really? Why?
-Yeah.

40:08.250 --> 40:12.750
I don't give a damn what people think.
It's funny to hear what people say.

40:13.583 --> 40:16.291
-This time, I don't know…
-You don't know what?

40:16.791 --> 40:17.625
I don't know.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.000
I was pissed.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.333
I wanted you to know who I really am.

40:36.958 --> 40:39.250
Is that part of your plan to get me?

40:39.333 --> 40:42.666
When you have connections,
you can do that sort of thing.

40:51.125 --> 40:54.666
-I have a present for you.
-You gave me back my gifts.

40:59.125 --> 41:00.166
What are you doing?

41:03.958 --> 41:05.833
Here. You don't want it?

41:06.833 --> 41:07.916
Or do you?

41:08.708 --> 41:11.041
-Or you don't want it?
-Stop it.

41:11.708 --> 41:14.166
I'll take it, but only because it's cold.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.208
-You totally dig my gift.
-No.

41:16.291 --> 41:19.250
-I'm cold.
-Your best Christmas ever. It's insane!

41:19.333 --> 41:21.416
Absolutely not. I'm just cold.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.458
You dig my present. I knew it.

41:23.541 --> 41:24.875
-No.
-It was written.

41:24.958 --> 41:28.333
You don't know anything.
I do know that I'm super comfy.

41:28.416 --> 41:30.125
-You're freezing.
-No.

41:30.208 --> 41:32.583
Yeah, you're freezing. You're shivering.

41:33.125 --> 41:35.250
I'm really good. I feel really good.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.250
Marcus! Your savior has come!

41:41.333 --> 41:42.708
I'm waiting downstairs.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.750
Stop playing it romantic.

41:55.208 --> 41:57.166
-Thanks.
-Merry Christmas.

41:57.250 --> 41:59.291
-Bye!
-Bye. See you soon.

41:59.375 --> 42:01.291
-And drive safely. Okay?
-Okay.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.375
-See you next year.
-Bye!

42:03.458 --> 42:05.958
-That's a cool family.
-Yeah, they're cool.

42:06.500 --> 42:09.875
-Did I interrupt something up there?
-No. We were talking.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.625
Did you say you were the investor?

42:12.708 --> 42:14.250
No, don't worry. Actually…

42:14.333 --> 42:16.333
-Yeah?
-What's the plan to get out?

42:17.833 --> 42:20.250
Hey! Everything's under control, man.

43:49.958 --> 43:51.375
Hold on. I have a plan.

43:51.458 --> 43:53.333
We take the shirt. We wring it.

43:57.250 --> 43:59.250
We make Marcus essential oil.

43:59.333 --> 44:01.125
All right. She's asleep.

44:03.625 --> 44:05.875
We can make serious dough with this.

44:05.958 --> 44:07.791
Good idea. I'll think about it.

44:07.875 --> 44:10.083
-There's something I don't get.
-What?

44:11.166 --> 44:12.708
You're on the roof.

44:12.791 --> 44:15.041
He gives you his shirt.
Your bodies are touching.

44:15.125 --> 44:17.250
It's so romantic I'm feeling queasy.

44:17.333 --> 44:21.041
-Isn't that the champagne?
-Probably. I'm going to get a refill.

44:21.708 --> 44:23.750
How come nothing happened there?

44:24.416 --> 44:26.833
It wasn't nothing. There were glances.

44:26.916 --> 44:29.000
-Glances, totally.
-Glances.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.416
If there were glances…

44:31.125 --> 44:32.958
-Wild.
-You guys are a pain.

44:33.041 --> 44:35.291
It's Marcus. We don't know each other.

44:35.375 --> 44:38.958
I'm leaving him to you because
you're not getting any. You're blowing it.

44:39.041 --> 44:40.666
My sister is so generous.

44:40.750 --> 44:43.041
I have a big heart,
but I want you to hit that ass.

44:43.125 --> 44:47.083
I don't mean going to the roof
to smoke cigs like 12-year-old brats.

44:48.583 --> 44:52.166
At this pace, two years from now,
you'll be brushing…

44:52.250 --> 44:53.833
-Knees?
-Elbows?

44:53.916 --> 44:55.541
-Or toes?
-You guys are hot.

44:55.625 --> 44:56.541
Leave me alone.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.500
I don't want to hear you.

45:05.208 --> 45:08.166
You think we got it wrong?
Maybe he's a good guy.

45:09.416 --> 45:11.000
-Don't know.
-You're not listening.

45:11.083 --> 45:14.291
I'm telling you
to get down with him on New Year's Eve.

45:14.375 --> 45:15.541
Unbelievable.

45:22.625 --> 45:23.958
I was tough on Mom.

45:25.083 --> 45:27.208
-Yeah. I'll apologize tomorrow.
-Yes.

45:27.291 --> 45:28.125
Yes.

45:28.708 --> 45:31.666
Daniel!

45:32.875 --> 45:34.000
Are you kidding me?

45:34.583 --> 45:37.375
-I wouldn't want to be you.
-With the kid there!

45:37.458 --> 45:41.041
-Can't she go fuck somewhere else?
-Yes!

45:54.125 --> 45:55.875
It's about time, girls!

45:55.958 --> 45:59.125
Jeanne, we spent
the weirdest Christmas in history.

45:59.208 --> 46:01.041
I discovered something insane.

46:01.125 --> 46:03.291
You'll never guess who came by.

46:03.375 --> 46:05.041
The investor. I checked.

46:05.125 --> 46:07.125
-I found out it's Marcus.
-Marcus.

46:09.375 --> 46:10.333
How do you know?

46:10.416 --> 46:12.791
Well… And you? How do you know?

46:16.250 --> 46:18.166
-No. You sure?
-100% sure.

46:18.250 --> 46:20.791
My girl has friends in investment funds.

46:21.458 --> 46:24.291
I asked her to check just in case.

46:24.375 --> 46:26.833
Why does he want to give us dough?

46:26.916 --> 46:29.291
It's feminism washing. To look innocent.

46:29.916 --> 46:32.541
If you're funding the cause,
you can't be the enemy.

46:32.625 --> 46:34.375
It's a reputational facelift.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.125
-That's it.
-I want to get my hands on him…

46:38.375 --> 46:40.416
Throw stuff in his face.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.041
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.666
That's a very good start.

46:44.750 --> 46:47.791
I'm going to tell him
where he can stick his money.

46:47.875 --> 46:50.458
-Are we not The Simones?
-You've got me pumped up.

46:52.541 --> 46:53.375
Yeah!
