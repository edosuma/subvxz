Hey.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.627
Hey.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.534
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

01:35.228 --> 01:36.798
<i>Okay-</i>

01:37.130 --> 01:38.700
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.407
Bye.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.229
Oh.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.140
Mm.

03:22.535 --> 03:27.382
Um, my brother and Candace
invited us over tonight.

03:27.540 --> 03:32.751
She asked me to bring something,
so I thought I'd make a JELL-O mold.

03:32.912 --> 03:38.624
But I have to stop by the market,
and pick up some mayonnaise.

03:39.452 --> 03:43.730
But I know you like that
and so does Candace, so...

03:44.457 --> 03:46.767
Can you get the radio?
I wanna hear the weather.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.337
Mm-hm.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.875
<i>It's New Year's Eve,
New York. Be <i>safe out there tonight.</i></i>

03:55.034 --> 03:56.911
<i>But right now,
we've got one more song...</i>

03:57.070 --> 03:59.050
<i>...then we'll have traffic
and the weather.</i>

04:17.890 --> 04:19.369
There are only seven names here.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.971
There are only seven editors
at the top 20 papers...

04:22.128 --> 04:24.768
-...who have a magazine background.
- They're all over 50.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.309
Steve Tilton from
the Dallas Morning News isn't.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.041
He's 49.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.206
It's the 1970s. I need someone
who can still get a hard-on.

04:32.372 --> 04:35.148
You said you wanted "sophisticated
with management chops...

04:35.308 --> 04:37.219
...and a strong sense of narrative."

04:37.377 --> 04:39.653
Doesn't say anything here
about tumescence.

04:40.747 --> 04:44.126
I never thought I'd ask this,
but find out who's restless over at <i>Time.</i>

04:45.785 --> 04:46.786
Sure.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.331
Good word, "tumescence."

05:06.706 --> 05:08.310
- Good morning, Viv.
- Good morning.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.920
I'd like you to distribute
the new desk calendars.

05:11.077 --> 05:14.058
I'm-- I'm on my way
to the little girls room.

05:14.213 --> 05:17.160
Okay, well, after that.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.700
Go ahead.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.673
Here's my résumé, Patti.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.414
I don't wanna get
a typewriter thrown at my head.

05:41.574 --> 05:45.044
The second we file this complaint,
they can't fire us.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.346
I hope you're right.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.923
I am.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.124
I am.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.264
- Thank you for spearheading this, Patti.
- No, it's all of us.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.762
So, what's next?

05:54.921 --> 05:56.127
Next, we party-

05:56.289 --> 05:58.769
- Do you wanna go to the Chelsea?
- I wouldn't miss it.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.632
I hear people run around naked there.

06:00.793 --> 06:04.070
- I'm counting you in.
- No, not me, I-- I'm still in mourning.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.836
- Peter broke up with her.
- Reporters don't break up with you.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.945
They just take a posting in Moscow.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.979
- I thought you were going with him.
- Me too.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.548
Look, all the more reason
for you to come out.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.979
You don't have to think
about him all night.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.142
How do you think
I'm getting over Doug?

06:16.309 --> 06:17.652
Dottie brought another dress.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.221
I can never make up my mind.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.882
- I would just be a wet blanket.
- Come on.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.823
Oh, she said no, Patti.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.290
Come on. There are doughnuts
in the break room.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.897
<i>That'll help.</i>

06:31.391 --> 06:35.635
Do you really think going to a party
is gonna help you get over Doug?

06:35.795 --> 06:38.002
Yeah.
That and some other things I'm trying.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.165
Mm.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.372
I need to move on.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.878
When Doug was arguing with me
about that Panther article...

06:44.036 --> 06:46.812
...and I couldn't get him
to see it my way, I just--

06:47.006 --> 06:48.883
Something died.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.616
Why don't you let me
take the résumés to Eleanor?

06:52.845 --> 06:55.849
Ned has a vacation day,
so there's not much to do.

06:56.015 --> 06:58.291
That would be great.
We're waiting on Doug's edit.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.295
Eleanor's office is closed.
You have to take it to her house.

07:01.454 --> 07:02.489
- Okay.
- In Harlem.

07:03.856 --> 07:06.302
- Hello.
- Hi, Jane.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.131
- What's going on?
- We were just plotting.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.974
Plotting revelry worthy of the night.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.078
I'm going to do mind-bending drugs.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.872
I am going to Harlem.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.182
To see a friend.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.978
And-- And then I'm gonna make
a JELL-O mold.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.142
Ooh.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.186
- Ah, heh.
- What about you, Jane?

07:25.344 --> 07:28.518
I am going to the mayor's
Young Society Ball with my boyfriend.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.423
Ooh. Sounds so elegant. Heh.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.619
Did you know that New Year's Eve...

07:33.786 --> 07:36.790
...is one of the most popular days
for proposals?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.630
Making memories
and making babies, that's what I heard.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.066
I didn't know that.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.707
We've been the last two years,
so it's a tradition.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.309
Well, you know,
it's not just a new year, Jane.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.468
It's a new decade, so...

07:48.768 --> 07:52.978
...I wouldn't be afraid
of trying at least one new thing tonight.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.849
You know,
I've never been to Harlem...

07:57.009 --> 07:58.886
...so that's new.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.167
They asked me to deliver the body.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.530
Son of a bitch.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.142
Patti.

08:20.399 --> 08:22.436
Bring your story file.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.379
Did it register on the Richter scale?

08:28.541 --> 08:29.713
I'm not a geologist.

08:29.876 --> 08:31.878
We just know the ground shook
for several seconds.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.024
- Get a domestic angle.
- Do we have an idea of the scope?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.956
- Finn--
- We just know it was big.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.890
So I have "a big earthquake" to go on?

08:39.051 --> 08:40.688
Till you find out more, yes.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.732
But Nixon can't get
reliable information out of China.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.528
How long have you been here,
Greenstone?

08:45.691 --> 08:48.103
- Uh, well, almost--
- My point being...

08:48.261 --> 08:50.332
...I should have been dazzled by now.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.497
Get out of here.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.579
- What can I do for you?
- You wanna kill my story?

08:57.737 --> 08:59.717
- For now, yeah. It's uninspired.
- Why?

09:00.139 --> 09:03.416
Doug, the rise of the Black Panthers
is compelling stuff.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.147
Race, power, violence,
everything that sells a magazine.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.790
- What? Speak.
- That's true.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.087
The Panthers are
the most exciting thing...

09:11.250 --> 09:13.491
...to happen to the counterculture
since the summer of love.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.098
See, that's what I want.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.633
To whites, to America,
the Panthers are Mandingo with a gun.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.134
They wanna steal white women.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.273
- That's not what I see.
- No, of course not.

09:22.428 --> 09:25.341
You see aviators and berets,
a crack in the establishment...

09:25.498 --> 09:28.104
...because you're young and hip.
Like we should be.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.747
So you want me to write
a love letter to the Panthers?

09:30.903 --> 09:33.008
- Now you're talking.
- It's sensationalism.

09:33.172 --> 09:35.174
That's the point.
The Panthers themselves...

09:35.341 --> 09:37.321
...have meticulously crafted
a sensational image.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.511
Let's do it justice.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.284
And the next time you wanna talk,
you call Angie and set a time.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.223
You don't just waltz into my office.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.933
Anything big?

09:56.095 --> 09:58.371
An assassin who tried to kill
the president of Panama...

09:58.531 --> 10:00.807
...last New Year's Eve
was just gunned down.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.969
You reap what you sow.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.344
Three women are in labor
at Mount Sinai.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.215
Are you covering
baby New Year again?

10:11.377 --> 10:12.685
Ever since I started here...

10:12.845 --> 10:15.883
...I've loved meeting the first baby
born closest to midnight.

10:16.182 --> 10:21.097
Reginald Adam Oaks
was born at exactly midnight in 1961.

10:21.253 --> 10:24.462
He had these rolls of fat
on his forearms...

10:24.624 --> 10:27.161
...like someone had tied
dental floss around him.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.499
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That sounds irresistible.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.936
I'll keep checking back.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.416
Yes.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.893
Yes. Oh...

11:03.529 --> 11:06.009
- I see you're mad.
- Yeah, well, that's what happens...

11:06.165 --> 11:07.439
...when you're supposed to be
on one team...

11:07.600 --> 11:09.273
...and suddenly you start
scoring points for the other side.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.436
I'm on your team.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.378
People on my team
don't cheer on the editor...

11:12.538 --> 11:14.347
...when he's killing my story.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.550
I wasn't cheering him on.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.453
I do think he has a point.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.527
Okay? It's what I was trying to tell you
after the funeral.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.527
There's a better angle on this thing.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.132
So you followed me in here
to tell me "I told you so"?

11:30.056 --> 11:31.865
Heh. That's what I thought.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.704
I called the Chinatown
Merchants Association.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.843
- And?
- Closed for the holiday.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.444
I also called the embassy.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.874
- And?
- They're denying...

11:43.035 --> 11:45.106
-...there was an earthquake.
- They're lying.

11:45.271 --> 11:48.013
It was reported in the AFP.
They felt it in Hanoi.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.879
- Denise.
- Yes?

11:51.043 --> 11:52.613
What do you have?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.718
<i>I'll</i> keep trying-

12:08.260 --> 12:10.570
News of the Week, this is Patti.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.838
Yes, I'll be right up.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.102
Have a seat.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.939
Is this about the Black Panther story...

12:53.105 --> 12:55.210
...because Doug's working on it
right now, and I think you're gonna--

12:55.374 --> 12:59.186
I'm about to write my first editor's page
of the new decade, and, uh, well...

13:00.279 --> 13:02.850
I thought you'd be
a good person to talk to.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.423
- You like 20-year-old Scotch?
- I'm sure that I would if I had ever tried it.

13:14.059 --> 13:15.436
Oh.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.974
You're in for a treat.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.104
You can only get this in Europe.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.916
It's like Cuban cigars, except legal.

13:30.876 --> 13:32.082
Mm.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.591
If life had a taste, this would be it.

13:35.748 --> 13:39.286
So, so far, I'm mulling over the idea...

13:39.451 --> 13:42.557
...that the '60s were
a decade of repression.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.899
In my freshman year
psychology course...

13:45.057 --> 13:49.062
...we learned suppression is conscious
but repression is unconscious.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.229
I like that.

13:50.396 --> 13:53.172
You start the decade off
with John F. Kennedy in Camelot...

13:53.332 --> 13:56.575
...everything appears perfect
only because so much is repressed.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.578
- Right.
- As the decade proceeds...

13:58.737 --> 14:02.742
...everything that's painful
and unresolved about American life...

14:02.908 --> 14:04.979
...just pushes to the surface.

14:06.812 --> 14:08.553
Okay, yeah.

14:08.714 --> 14:13.288
So, what if the '70s are
a decade about expansion?

14:13.819 --> 14:16.129
So the country's moving
from repression to expansion?

14:16.288 --> 14:18.564
- Mm-hm.
- That's good.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.832
Looks like it stopped raining
out there finally.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.998
Oh, yeah, it's--
It's clearing up very nicely.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.909
You have a beautiful home, Mrs. Norton.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.413
Please don't call me that. I don't belong
to my father or my husband.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.846
Call me Eleanor.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.412
Eleanor.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.714
Ahem. Uh, uh--

15:11.877 --> 15:17.520
We-- We got 36 resumes,
18 researchers and 18 reporters.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.523
Now we're starting to get somewhere.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.265
This gal went to
the University of Pennsylvania...

15:23.422 --> 15:25.231
...graduated with honors.

15:25.391 --> 15:29.430
Her reporter went to
City College for two years.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.438
Never graduated.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.472
This is what I've been talking about.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.306
You can take your coat off, Cindy.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.641
Heh. Ahem.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.814
I was just about to
fix myself my second lunch.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.215
- Are you hungry?
- Oh, no, thank you.

15:44.376 --> 15:47.050
Oh... Oh, ooh.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.854
Ooh. Oh. Uh...

15:51.016 --> 15:53.690
This baby's got me
a little lightheaded today.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.924
Mrs. Norton-- Uh, um, sorry. Eleanor.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.534
You are expecting.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.194
Please stay there
and let me fix you something.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.670
Thank you. Thank you, Cindy.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.947
- Will you run this to the copy desk?
- Of course.

16:12.838 --> 16:18.049
So you have any special
young people plans for New Year's Eve?

16:18.210 --> 16:19.484
I am going to the Chelsea.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.147
There are some parties there.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.317
I have heard some shocking
sordid tales about that place.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.259
Well, they're only shocking if you're old.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.525
- Or if you don't read Rolling Stone.
- Well, I've always been old.

16:30.789 --> 16:33.030
- How's that?
- Before I left for New York...

16:33.192 --> 16:35.866
...my father showed me a picture
of the Empire State Building, and said:

16:36.028 --> 16:38.269
"Win or don't come home."

16:38.998 --> 16:41.239
No time to relax with a mandate like that.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.539
I have some good news.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.141
You've won.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.012
You can party now.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.179
What'd you think of the Scotch?

16:52.344 --> 16:55.154
I think I would've rather had the cigar.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.230
I have more names for you.

17:00.986 --> 17:02.932
I know exactly who I need.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.453
Thirty-six.

18:33.579 --> 18:34.614
Twenty-four.

18:35.714 --> 18:36.715
Thirty-four.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.694
Almost.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.932
That's what my mother says
about my ratio.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.465
"Almost."

18:44.623 --> 18:46.159
No, hip is perfect.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.430
Oh, no, I'm not complaining,
it's just that...

18:48.594 --> 18:51.666
-...that's what she always says, is all.
- I do this long time.

18:51.830 --> 18:55.107
Heh. Oh...

18:59.571 --> 19:01.073
Sweet or salty?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.844
Excuse me?

19:07.946 --> 19:10.950
Oh. Um...

19:11.250 --> 19:15.357
I think my fiance
would probably prefer sweet.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.392
- It's going to be our first time.
- Oh.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.764
We need the most beautiful.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.166
Thank you.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.730
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

19:25.697 --> 19:28.439
You lose virginity only once.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.577
Oh...

19:31.737 --> 19:33.580
Chad will love it.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.015
He says blue brings out my eyes.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.848
Everything change after tonight.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.223
I will be right outside.

19:43.382 --> 19:46.852
If you need anything, tell me. Okay?

20:11.343 --> 20:14.256
I'm so far from dazzling Finn.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.425
Chinese food.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.721
I just ate.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.091
You know how there's
Hunan, Mandarin, Cantonese?

20:21.253 --> 20:23.062
- I said I'm not hungry.
- That's not what I mean.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.224
Where did the earthquake happen?

20:25.924 --> 20:27.562
Um...

20:28.160 --> 20:30.140
Closest guess is Chengdu.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.798
Okay, that's the city,
but what's the region?

20:34.933 --> 20:36.640
Szechuan.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.540
Szechuan.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.211
Szechuan.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.650
You know what?

20:45.811 --> 20:47.188
- I am kind of hungry.
- Ha, ha.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.383
- Grab your coat.
- Okay.

20:51.950 --> 20:52.951
Just kill it.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.791
Do you barge into other places like this?

20:54.953 --> 20:57.832
I don't wanna spend three days
on a story you don't wanna run.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.230
Will you...

21:00.092 --> 21:02.698
Well, I'd offer you a drink,
but I'm afraid it'll only make you angrier.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.534
- I just--
- Look, six months ago--

21:04.696 --> 21:07.404
Hell, three weeks ago,
I would have published your article as is.

21:07.566 --> 21:10.308
Proudly. But the times,
they are a-changing, Doug.

21:10.469 --> 21:11.675
- Who said that?
- Bob Dylan.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.113
- Correct.
- Off his 1964 album of the same name.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.514
Well, he was prescient,
things are changing now.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.349
And this magazine needs to change
along with them.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.624
Don't tell them
what they've already heard.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.530
Walter Cronkite didn't visit
their headquarters, you did.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.462
You saw them feed their children.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.067
You've seen their offices.

21:32.224 --> 21:34.830
You know what kind of cologne
their leader wears.

21:38.664 --> 21:41.508
And you're the best writer I have.
At least you could be...

21:41.667 --> 21:43.704
...if you could
get out of your comfort zone.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.739
- Let me take another pass at it.
- Good.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.386
Because I want to run that version
two weeks from now.

21:50.542 --> 21:51.612
As a cover.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.450
Close the door.

21:56.114 --> 21:57.491
Got it.

21:59.184 --> 22:00.663
I remember Gloria.

22:01.019 --> 22:05.229
She had the biggest bouffant in the pit.

22:05.524 --> 22:08.403
Her reporter took her to Mexico City
where he's bureau chief.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.831
You're still in love with him, aren't you?

22:10.996 --> 22:13.237
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

22:13.532 --> 22:15.170
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.075
You are gonna come to
the Chelsea tonight...

22:17.235 --> 22:19.374
...because it'll be fun and distracting.

22:19.538 --> 22:21.814
My mom was gonna take me
to see Hello, Dolly!

22:21.973 --> 22:23.975
- Mm.
- Doesn't that sound festive?

22:24.142 --> 22:26.486
Yeah, for a Wednesday.

22:26.745 --> 22:29.453
I don't know. Am I a Chelsea girl?

22:30.916 --> 22:32.987
I think you are.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.195
Trust me, it'll be groovy.

22:35.821 --> 22:36.822
We're out of coffee.

22:37.789 --> 22:38.927
I'll make a pot.

22:39.725 --> 22:41.898
And there's something sticky
on the refrigerator handle.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.700
It's honey or something.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.577
Here we go.

22:52.637 --> 22:55.117
Amen to this.

22:55.774 --> 22:58.277
My mother calls it shit on a shingle.

23:00.178 --> 23:01.657
Don't let that ruin it for you.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.815
I'll try not to.

23:04.516 --> 23:05.517
You don't want any?

23:05.684 --> 23:09.461
Oh, no, Lenny and I are going over
to my brother's later.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.237
Mm. It's delicious.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.737
- Thank you.
- Heh-heh-heh.

23:18.430 --> 23:21.809
Um, do you--
Do you have anything to drink?

23:22.434 --> 23:24.038
You mean, like, liquor?

23:24.202 --> 23:26.512
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's New Year's.

23:26.671 --> 23:27.877
Oh, yes, of course.

23:28.039 --> 23:30.713
There should be a bottle of brandy
on the counter. Help yourself.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.116
Thanks.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.484
You know what I wanna know?

23:39.651 --> 23:41.460
Uh, what?

23:41.887 --> 23:44.026
What it's like to be Cindy.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.627
Uh,well...

23:50.028 --> 23:51.871
Um, uh...

23:53.265 --> 23:57.611
- I'm just a regular person.
- What does regular mean to you?

23:58.003 --> 23:59.949
Um,well...

24:01.339 --> 24:02.750
Uh...

24:05.043 --> 24:07.717
I grew up in Rye.

24:07.879 --> 24:11.326
Yeah, my dad worked for IBM...

24:11.683 --> 24:15.893
-...and my mom was a mom.
- I have another question for you.

24:16.054 --> 24:18.796
Of all the men in the world,
why did you pick your husband?

24:21.426 --> 24:24.134
God, I'm not sure that I did.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.436
I think Lenny might have picked me.

24:31.169 --> 24:32.773
What does he think of the lawsuit?

24:32.938 --> 24:35.418
Oh, he's-- You know, he thinks--

24:35.574 --> 24:37.144
He thinks that it is good.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.085
Really good.

24:42.681 --> 24:44.126
Huh.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.791
So when are you planning to tell him?

24:49.521 --> 24:52.263
I'm not sure that I am going to.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.567
So would you say that
you're not sure if you're...

24:55.727 --> 24:59.265
...committed to this lawsuit,
or to your husband?

25:15.747 --> 25:18.057
My mother-in-law is staying until 1.

25:18.216 --> 25:20.253
Oh, that's nice.

25:20.418 --> 25:22.864
My shoes won't stay on.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.030
I'm gonna have to shuffle my way
into the new year.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.694
Oh, I can help you with that.

25:29.227 --> 25:32.208
- Give me your foot.
- Eww.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.901
I'm letting you in
on an old pageant secret.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.079
I don't usually tell anyone...

25:38.236 --> 25:40.147
...but I was Miss Ocean City, New Jersey.

25:40.305 --> 25:41.841
- You were in pageants?
- Oh, yeah.

25:43.174 --> 25:44.482
What was your talent?

25:46.678 --> 25:48.282
Spying again?

25:50.582 --> 25:52.220
- Oh...
- Wow.

25:52.751 --> 25:54.355
I like your dress.

25:55.487 --> 25:56.989
You look great.

25:57.355 --> 25:59.631
No, really, I like your dress.

25:59.791 --> 26:01.327
Thank you.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.304
The last Panther file.

26:06.464 --> 26:09.411
- Do you need anything else from me?
- That'll be it. Thank you.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.911
Is this what you're doing
for New Year's Eve?

26:13.338 --> 26:14.442
If I wanna get drunk...

26:14.606 --> 26:17.246
...I'll wait till tomorrow
when there's less competition.

26:20.979 --> 26:22.652
You okay?

26:24.783 --> 26:26.888
You going to the Chelsea thing
with everybody?

26:27.052 --> 26:30.158
Yes.
Everyone just leaves their door open...

26:30.322 --> 26:33.030
...and you dive into whatever scene
looks good to you.

26:33.191 --> 26:35.831
- Andy Warhol's gonna be there.
- Andy Warhol, the boxer?

26:35.994 --> 26:37.598
No, Andy Warhol the quarterback.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.345
Doug...

26:46.137 --> 26:47.207
You know, next year...

26:48.106 --> 26:49.278
You mean tomorrow?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.284
I mean tomorrow.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.449
I would understand if you wanted
to pick a new researcher.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.795
Now, why would I wanna do that?

27:04.255 --> 27:05.893
Go to your party.

27:06.691 --> 27:08.193
Have fun.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.372
How's my baby?

27:22.874 --> 27:25.184
- And how's Delores? Ha-ha-ha.
- Oh.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.880
Can you believe my husband
wants to name our girl Delores?

27:28.113 --> 27:29.751
I think it's glamorous.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.922
Edward, this is Cindy
from News of the <i>Week.</i>

27:33.084 --> 27:34.256
Cindy, Edward.

27:34.419 --> 27:35.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.328
I heard you're about to make history.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.230
That's what I've been trying to tell her.

27:39.391 --> 27:42.031
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

27:42.460 --> 27:46.533
Hey, I brought a little
something special for New Year's.

27:46.698 --> 27:49.975
Ah... Spearmint leaves.

27:50.568 --> 27:53.105
- My favorite.
- Just taking care of my baby.

27:54.939 --> 27:57.283
What-- What is your boy name?

27:57.442 --> 27:59.080
Langston.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.617
We can agree on that. Heh, heh.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.619
Langston Hughes Norton.

28:05.784 --> 28:08.390
- His first two words are gonna rhyme.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.362
His middle name
is not gonna be Hughes.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.025
Langston is a great name.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.397
Strong.

28:14.559 --> 28:15.663
Strong.

28:17.495 --> 28:19.771
Can I get either of you two
anything to drink?

28:19.931 --> 28:21.137
No, I'm good, thanks.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.710
Oh, no.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.312
- No?
- I'm good.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.716
Cindy, could you pass me that
candy dish over there, please?

28:30.875 --> 28:32.513
Oh, of course.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.112
It's gorgeous.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.643
- Thank you. All right.
- You're very welcome.

29:10.281 --> 29:12.818
Smile, sweetie, Suzanne Winchester
is right over there.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.256
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.421
I thought you didn't care
what she thinks.

29:16.588 --> 29:20.195
I don't, I'm just surprised
how many people read her newsletter.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.762
There's Dave up there.

29:22.927 --> 29:23.962
David.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.131
- Well, Iookie here.
- There he is.

29:26.297 --> 29:28.038
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

29:28.199 --> 29:29.974
If it isn't the most
beautiful couple in New York.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.773
I was going to say the same of you.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.109
She was.
She said as much on the way over.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.910
What is this dress?

29:36.074 --> 29:38.145
I dragged Daddy
all the way to Bergdorf's...

29:38.309 --> 29:40.619
...because I knew if I tried it on,
he wouldn't be able to say no.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.520
- Ha, ha.
- Of course not. Ha, ha.

29:42.680 --> 29:43.818
Ladies.

29:43.982 --> 29:45.689
- Shall we?
- Mm-hm.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.431
Douglas.

29:58.496 --> 30:00.635
What the hell are you still doing here?

30:00.799 --> 30:01.971
Working.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.205
Deli guy will be up any minute
with my last meal of the '60's.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.008
The story's not due for
another couple of weeks.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.311
You're not going to
the shindig at the Chelsea?

30:09.474 --> 30:12.250
Oh, I might head over to Cole's
before the kissing starts...

30:12.410 --> 30:13.548
...more my speed.

30:13.711 --> 30:15.884

33:17.695 --> 33:19.140
I've been thinking about it.

33:19.297 --> 33:21.106
And I have a surprise for you later.

33:21.866 --> 33:23.504
I'm ready.

33:25.536 --> 33:27.072
For what?

33:27.872 --> 33:30.250
I'm ready to make love.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.279
Jane.

33:33.878 --> 33:35.721
You don't have to do that.

33:37.281 --> 33:40.160
Well, I know I don't have to. I want to.

33:40.318 --> 33:43.197
I know it's something you've wanted.

33:46.824 --> 33:48.804
I care about you, Jane.

33:50.395 --> 33:51.396
We grew up together.

33:51.963 --> 33:54.534
You gave me that ultimatum,
and I've been thinking.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.736
If I have to decide...

33:56.901 --> 33:59.643
We've been together for so long,
and I know what this is.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.042
You're not breaking up with me.

34:02.607 --> 34:03.984
Yeah.

34:04.942 --> 34:08.014
If you were gonna break up with me,
then why did you bring me here?

34:08.478 --> 34:10.719
I wanted you to have a good New Year's.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.893
I'm sorry. Let's go sit down.

34:23.928 --> 34:25.998
Don't you dare.

Well, the circulation, obviously.

Prestige, which I know
you don't give a damn about.

34:47.284 --> 34:49.060
And then there's the money.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.427

I'll probably quadruple it.
