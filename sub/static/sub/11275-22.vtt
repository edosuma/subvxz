That's great,                   
'cause I knocked up Annie good. 

06:36.697 --> 06:37.396
What!?                          

06:39.433 --> 06:40.466
    Hey, hey, hey!              

06:40.500 --> 06:42.602
    Oh! Oh! Carla!              

06:42.636 --> 06:45.271
Carla! Carla!                   

06:45.305 --> 06:47.340
 What are you thinking of?!     

06:47.374 --> 06:49.342
    I just waxed that table.    

06:49.376 --> 06:51.210
         Come here, come here.  
         Come on, come on.      

06:51.245 --> 06:52.878
             Get off. Come on.  

06:52.912 --> 06:54.714
         Come here, come here.  

07:00.820 --> 07:02.555
    And besides...              

07:02.589 --> 07:04.423
        this is family business.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.058
Let's, um...                    

07:07.060 --> 07:09.194
         Let's talk             
    about this later, okay?     

07:09.228 --> 07:11.363
                     ( <i>sighs</i> )  

07:26.079 --> 07:28.814
So what kind of car             
do you drive, Ed?               

07:30.750 --> 07:31.984
I thought you said              

07:32.018 --> 07:33.719
you wanted to be a grandmother. 

07:33.753 --> 07:35.120
                        Someday.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.188
            Like years from now,

07:36.222 --> 07:38.724
        when you've moved       
        thousands of miles away.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.493
         Carla, please.         

07:44.798 --> 07:47.232
I drive a Corvette myself.      

07:48.435 --> 07:49.902
         How could you do this?!

07:49.936 --> 07:52.805
             Hey, I'm going to  
             be 20 in two years.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.041
                 I can hear my  
                 biological     
                 clock ticking. 

07:56.075 --> 07:58.744
         Do you know what it    
         takes to raise a kid?  

07:58.778 --> 08:00.613
Ma, will you relax?             
I got a job.                    

08:00.647 --> 08:02.181
             You think you can  
             support a family   

08:02.215 --> 08:03.315
         pushing cheeseburgers?!

08:03.350 --> 08:04.950
Well, I thought                 
we'd all stay here.             

08:04.984 --> 08:06.285
                 Ho-ho, great.  

08:06.319 --> 08:08.120
                 More people    
                 in this house. 

08:08.155 --> 08:10.656
                 I get about 19 
                 on the highway,
                 15 in town.    

08:12.292 --> 08:15.927
     Whose stupid idea          
     was this anyway?           

08:15.962 --> 08:18.564
     Hey, I was getting bored   
     sitting around the house.  

08:18.598 --> 08:20.999
I thought this might            
give her something to do.       

08:21.034 --> 08:22.000
         I'll give you          

08:22.035 --> 08:23.202
something to do!                

08:24.237 --> 08:25.771
            Oh!                 
                        EDDIE:  
                        No, no. 

08:25.805 --> 08:27.739
    Carla, Carla, Carla!        

08:27.774 --> 08:30.376
            Come on.            

08:30.410 --> 08:31.644
                         Well...

08:31.678 --> 08:34.111
     if this is the way         
that we are going to be treated 

08:34.147 --> 08:36.048
     on the happiest day        
     of our young lives,        

08:36.082 --> 08:38.484
     then I don't want          
 to live in this house anymore! 

08:40.520 --> 08:41.886
                Anthony!        

08:41.921 --> 08:43.556
     You should probably        
         come with me.          

08:43.590 --> 08:46.842
    But we haven't eaten yet.   

08:46.876 --> 08:48.577
     Your hair is full          
     of bread crumbs.           

08:48.611 --> 08:51.046
 We could butter your head      
     and make a sandwich.       

08:52.382 --> 08:55.250
I had a sandwich for lunch!     

08:55.285 --> 08:56.518
Oh, go on.                      
Go, go!                         

08:56.552 --> 08:57.519
Get out of here!                

08:57.553 --> 08:58.988
Let's see how long              
you last on your own!           

08:59.022 --> 09:00.555
I give you three days!          

09:00.590 --> 09:02.658
Two, two tops! You hear me?     

09:02.692 --> 09:05.161
                Carla, come on. 
                Calm down.      

09:06.696 --> 09:11.466
 Sammy, you get 15 in the city? 

09:11.501 --> 09:13.919
             Hey, so they're    
             gonna have a baby. 

09:13.953 --> 09:15.171
They'll, they'll find their way 
         through it.            

09:16.206 --> 09:19.408
     You don't understand.      

09:19.442 --> 09:20.642
        My life is over.        

09:20.677 --> 09:23.045
 I'm going to be a grandmother. 

09:23.079 --> 09:24.163
I mean,                         

09:24.314 --> 09:26.131
 I might as well wrap myself up 

09:26.165 --> 09:27.466
     in a black babushka,       

09:27.500 --> 09:30.001
     get fat and grow hairs     
        out of my moles.        

09:30.036 --> 09:31.503
                    Oh, come on.

09:31.538 --> 09:32.771

09:32.805 --> 09:34.005
                 You're         
                 exaggerating.  

09:34.040 --> 09:36.542
         Do I have              
 to get out the family album?   

09:36.576 --> 09:38.093
CARLA:                          
Oh, God,                        

09:38.128 --> 09:39.628
     this is terrible.          

09:40.830 --> 09:42.998
        Look at my life.        

09:43.033 --> 09:44.299
    I never had a childhood.    

09:44.333 --> 09:46.468
 I married Nick when I was 15.  

09:46.502 --> 09:49.155
Never got to go                 
to the prom or homecoming,      

09:49.189 --> 09:50.956
     to a slumber party,        

09:50.990 --> 09:53.792
     to Fort Lauderdale         
        on Spring Break.        

09:53.826 --> 09:56.061
     Or on one lousy date       
         with Fabian.           

09:57.947 --> 09:59.999
     Now I don't even get       
         a middle age.          

10:00.033 --> 10:03.301
 Go straight from grade school  
         to Granny.             

10:03.336 --> 10:04.486
 I don't know what to say,

                         Carla. 

10:05.638 --> 10:07.173
 Just don't say anything, okay? 

10:07.207 --> 10:08.490
There's nothing                 
anybody can say                 

10:08.524 --> 10:09.808
 that's gonna change anything,  

10:09.842 --> 10:11.210
 so just don't say anything.    

10:11.244 --> 10:11.677
     Yeah, but, Carla...        

10:11.711 --> 10:13.028
Sam, I said don't say anything. 

10:13.062 --> 10:14.363
 Weren't you listening to me?   

10:14.397 --> 10:14.914
         Yes, Carla...          

10:14.948 --> 10:16.665
 I said don't say anything!     

10:16.700 --> 10:18.166
     Nobody listens to me.      

10:18.201 --> 10:18.717
         I listen to...         

10:18.752 --> 10:21.437
Shut up, shut up, shut up!      

10:21.471 --> 10:24.706

     and leave me alone!

of my favorite paintings        

10:37.637 --> 10:39.471
of the Comuneros.               

10:39.506 --> 10:41.640
It depicts the peasant army     
struggling                      

10:41.675 --> 10:44.876
to push this cannon             
to the top of the hill.         

10:44.911 --> 10:47.213
Later, they found out           
they were on the wrong hill     

10:47.247 --> 10:49.348
and had fired                   
on their own village.           

10:49.382 --> 10:53.686
These people                    
had no luck.                    

10:55.171 --> 10:58.223
             That's fascinating,
             Dorothy.           

10:58.258 --> 11:00.426
         Isn't that             
         fascinating, Frasier?  

11:01.645 --> 11:03.012
         Oh, yes, yes.          

11:03.046 --> 11:07.016
You know, these stories make me 
 long to visit Paraguay...      

11:07.050 --> 11:09.551

    ( <i>hooting and cheering</i> )    

11:15.675 --> 11:17.727
I hired you                     
as a temporary waitress.        

11:17.761 --> 11:19.862
What on earth were you doing    
with your blouse off?           

11:19.896 --> 11:21.330
                 Serving drinks.

11:21.365 --> 11:22.832
This is not a topless bar.      

11:22.866 --> 11:25.067
             What, I'm supposed 
             to get tips for    
             good service?      

11:25.101 --> 11:27.069
             Yes, dear, that's  
             the way we do      
             it around here.

Well, I'm sorry,                

11:28.372 --> 11:30.673
but I don't beauties            
like these under wraps.         

11:30.707 --> 11:32.140
             Out.               

11:32.175 --> 11:33.508
Out!

can we get some service?

11:44.755 --> 11:46.889
Oh, I'm sorry.                  
I'll take care of that.         

11:46.923 --> 11:48.056
         I've had it.           

11:48.091 --> 11:49.492
 Isn't Carla ever coming back?  

11:49.526 --> 11:51.026
         I was not born         
     to be a waitress.          

11:51.060 --> 11:52.595
         I was born             
     to manage waitresses.      

11:52.629 --> 11:55.263
                    Oh, Miss?   
You'll get it

             to cheer up Carla,

                think it worked.

    Uh, well, I don't know,     
        but let's start         

12:27.530 --> 12:28.663
             at square one here.

12:28.698 --> 12:29.998
                 We know that,  
                 uh, she's upset

12:30.032 --> 12:31.567
             about having a     
             grandchild, right? 

12:31.601 --> 12:33.268
Another round, Sam?             

12:33.303 --> 12:34.370
                Coming right up.

12:34.404 --> 12:36.405
             Table 11, please.  

12:38.207 --> 12:39.541
Well, she was complaining       

12:39.576 --> 12:41.943
 that she'd missed out on all   
 that teenage stuff, you know?  

12:41.978 --> 12:43.345
Homecoming, proms, may...       

12:43.379 --> 12:44.814
 What-What if we do something   

12:44.848 --> 12:46.749
        to take her back        
     to her teen years?         

12:46.783 --> 12:47.883
     Like get her pregnant?     

12:47.917 --> 12:49.151
                         CLIFF: 
                         No.    

12:49.185 --> 12:51.186
        That's been done        
         to death.              

12:53.289 --> 12:54.890
W-What else did she say?        
What else?                      

12:54.924 --> 12:56.158
             Uh, let me think,  
             let me think.      

12:56.192 --> 12:57.826
            All right, something
            about a sleep over. 

12:57.861 --> 12:59.061
                 No, no, I know.
                 Slumber party. 

12:59.095 --> 13:00.062
            Yeah, slumber party.

13:00.096 --> 13:01.063
A slumber party?                
                    Right.      

13:01.097 --> 13:02.430
                Well, that's it.

13:02.465 --> 13:03.799
             Why don't we just  
             throw the woman    

13:03.833 --> 13:05.650
         a slumber party, and   
         that'll cheer her up.  

13:05.685 --> 13:07.519
Recreating a ritual             
of youth is often               

13:07.553 --> 13:08.821
just the thing                  
to get someone                  

13:08.855 --> 13:11.356
out of depression centered      
on a fear of aging.             

13:11.390 --> 13:13.358
I find it also helps            
to listen to heavy doses        

13:13.392 --> 13:15.894
of Credence Clearwater Revival.

             SAM:               
             All right.         

13:20.200 --> 13:21.233
             REBECCA:           
             Just one question. 

13:21.267 --> 13:22.835
             What-what do you do
             at a slumber party?

13:22.869 --> 13:25.037
                Well, the phrase
                "slumber party" 

13:25.071 --> 13:27.072
                would imply     
                that one sleeps,

13:27.107 --> 13:30.342
     but somehow I sense        
     that's meant to be ironic. 

13:31.912 --> 13:34.212
         Terrific. We're really 
         on a roll here.        

13:34.247 --> 13:35.647
I have a patient of that age.   

13:35.682 --> 13:37.349
I suppose                       
I could do some research        

13:37.384 --> 13:38.751
             and help you put   
             something together.

13:38.885 --> 13:39.835
             REBECCA:           
             Thank you, Lilith. 

13:39.869 --> 13:41.069
                I would really  
                appreciate that.

13:41.104 --> 13:42.437
                    LILITH:     
                    Certainly.  
Say, Rebecca,

if you're in need               

13:43.139 --> 13:44.356
of some extra guests,           

13:44.391 --> 13:45.757
I know a couple                 
of fun-loving gals              

13:45.792 --> 13:47.393
            who could really use
            a night on the town 

13:47.427 --> 13:48.427
                 away from      
                 boring old me. 

13:48.461 --> 13:50.596
And, uh,                        

13:50.630 --> 13:51.864
                 Lilith, you've 
                 always told me 

13:51.898 --> 13:53.799
         that you found Carla   
         an interesting, uh...

Won't you be lonely?            

13:56.803 --> 13:57.703
FRASIER:                        
Well, it'll give me             

13:57.737 --> 13:59.754
            a chance to be alone
            with Dorothy's books

13:59.789 --> 14:01.990
             and a roaring fire.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.946
                Well, what do   
                you say, Lilith?

            All right, I'm gonna
            put on the 45s.

                 Where's Carla? 

14:45.518 --> 14:46.818
She's in the back room knitting.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.687
             Oh, that's a sign  
             she's perking up.  

14:48.721 --> 14:49.854
I don't think so.               

14:49.889 --> 14:51.890
It's her death shroud.          

14:53.859 --> 14:55.460
        Oh, no.                 

14:55.495 --> 14:58.397
I forgot the marshmallows       
for the hot chocolate.

     That's okay, we'll use     
     the ones for the s'mores.

     Then what will we use      
        for the s'mores?

     Why don't we just skip     
         the s'mores?

You've been trying to get rid of
the s'mores since we've started.

         No, I haven't.

That's right, Carla.

Now, Carla,

we know you're down,

         of the season.         

22:58.611 --> 22:59.777
    Shut up.                    

22:59.812 --> 23:02.080
         Oh, yeah? You want     
         a punch in the mouth?  

23:04.783 --> 23:06.818
 You're gonna be all right?     

23:06.852 --> 23:08.035
             Yeah.              

23:08.070 --> 23:10.505
         I appreciate           
 what you tried to do, Sam.     

23:10.539 --> 23:12.757
                 I'll be okay,  
                 you know?      

23:12.791 --> 23:15.726
     You know, something        
     always comes along,        

23:15.761 --> 23:18.163
     some little something,     

23:18.197 --> 23:19.797
 makes everything work out.     

23:20.966 --> 23:21.967
 But I got to find it myself.   

23:22.001 --> 23:23.101
    You can't do it for me.     

23:23.135 --> 23:24.735
         All right.             

23:26.255 --> 23:28.923
     You know my number.        

23:28.958 --> 23:31.776
( <i>door closes</i> )                 

23:31.810 --> 23:33.361
( <i>latch turns</i> )                 

23:34.297 --> 23:35.514
     Sorry, Carla, I, uh...     

23:35.548 --> 23:37.682
( <i>clears throat</i> )               

23:37.717 --> 23:39.367
 ... just forgot my jacket.     

23:39.401 --> 23:41.068
( <i>ripping sound</i> )               

23:46.742 --> 23:49.677
     Darn these pants.          

23:49.712 --> 23:50.912
 Why do they keep doing this?   

23:50.946 --> 23:52.013
     I had them fixed.          

23:53.305 --> 23:59.922
