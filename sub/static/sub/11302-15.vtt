WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:08.092
Ooh!

00:08.176 --> 00:10.637
You got an interview,
church or a funeral?

00:12.180 --> 00:14.224
I'm trying to catch Abby
before she goes to work,

00:14.307 --> 00:16.142
ask her on our first official date.

00:16.226 --> 00:18.603
Mmm. I'm gonna file
that under "funeral."

00:21.981 --> 00:25.235
I'm even wearing the Dockers
that make my butt look good.

00:25.318 --> 00:27.612
Either that or my butt makes
these Dockers look good.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.366
- Kind of a chicken or egg thing.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.493
If the chicken has a hot ass.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.189
Plus, I'm wearing my lucky shirt.

00:36.913 --> 00:38.164
Why is that your lucky shirt?

00:38.831 --> 00:41.334
Wearing this the day I made the
Buffalo Bills practice squad.

00:42.377 --> 00:43.670
You were cut the next day.

00:45.505 --> 00:47.674
I wasn't wearing the shirt the next day.

00:49.801 --> 00:52.220
Also, I wore it during my
public intoxication hearing.

00:53.972 --> 00:55.390
You were found guilty.

00:57.475 --> 00:58.810
I got probation.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.688
It's just a fancy word
for innocent. [Chuckles]

01:03.940 --> 01:05.316
What are you doing? [Sighs]

01:05.400 --> 01:07.318
Checking out a website for bull semen.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.990
Shouldn't you be doing
something work-related?

01:12.073 --> 01:13.575
[both chuckle]

01:13.658 --> 01:16.494
Dad's looking to improve
the genetics of the herd,

01:16.578 --> 01:18.413
so I figured I'd check
out other options.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.832
Check it out, man. It's
like Tinder for bulls.

01:23.418 --> 01:24.460
Ooh!

01:24.544 --> 01:26.796
Boy, look at that cowboy, Troy.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.719
Yeah, but you got to
check out Big Dennis, huh?

01:28.798 --> 01:30.842
We should be calling
him "Very Big Dennis."

01:33.261 --> 01:35.179
Yeah, but look at the scrotum on Troy.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.599
Dude, the scrotum on
Dennis is massive, man.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.083
Think about the amount of semen
that thing's gonna churn out.

01:41.853 --> 01:44.397
This why my computer
has so many pop-ups?

01:46.399 --> 01:48.234
Hey, Dad, you gotta check this out.

01:48.318 --> 01:52.405
Yeah, nothing like checking
out scrotums with my sons.

01:53.072 --> 01:55.325
We're looking at a new
supplier for bull semen.

01:55.408 --> 01:57.201
I'll take care of that.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.263
Right, you'll do it,
because if we do it,

01:59.287 --> 02:00.663
we'll just screw it up, right?

02:00.747 --> 02:03.833
When he dies, he's gonna come
back from the dead to haunt us.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.502
Just to tell us what a
half-ass job we did burying him.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.131
[imitating Beau] "You
call that a grave?"

02:11.716 --> 02:14.552
That stuff costs over $200 a shot,

02:14.636 --> 02:17.263
from the bulls with the best genes.

02:17.347 --> 02:20.183
I'm not gonna trust
you two with my semen.

02:25.438 --> 02:26.731
- [both laughing]
- Come on, man.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.500
I wasn't gonna laugh, but
then you started laughing!

02:28.524 --> 02:29.918
I wasn't gonna laugh...
Nah, you started smiling.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.045
No, you had a little crinkle

02:31.069 --> 02:32.070
- in the corner.
- No. No.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.780
That's what I'm talking about.

02:33.863 --> 02:36.324
You can't even talk
about it, let alone do it.

02:38.409 --> 02:39.410
- Hey, Mom.
- Mom?

02:39.494 --> 02:40.703
Hey, boys.

02:40.787 --> 02:42.372
You, uh, spend the night?

02:42.455 --> 02:43.456
Yep.

02:44.457 --> 02:47.418
Uh... you moving back in?

02:47.502 --> 02:49.754
No. We're getting a divorce.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.051
I'm starting to think
this ain't my lucky shirt.

02:58.096 --> 03:00.098

04:04.370 --> 04:05.621
[doorbell ringing]

04:10.585 --> 04:11.836
Colt, what are you doing here?

04:14.005 --> 04:15.465
I couldn't sleep last night.

04:15.548 --> 04:18.926
I was... I just kept thinking
about what we talked about.

04:19.844 --> 04:20.970
Okay.

04:23.723 --> 04:26.267
I told you I was gonna prove
to you how much you mean to me.

04:27.185 --> 04:28.352
At 6:30 in the morning?

04:28.436 --> 04:31.272
[stammers] 6:30, noon, 3:00.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.065
Whatever it takes.

04:33.149 --> 04:34.692
We couldn't have started at 3:00?

04:34.776 --> 04:35.985
[chuckles]

04:36.068 --> 04:37.528
Nope, this couldn't wait.

04:38.488 --> 04:39.728
You're looking at the new Colt.

04:40.907 --> 04:42.307
The Colt that's gonna win you over.

04:44.577 --> 04:47.079
Got you... your favorite flowers.

04:47.163 --> 04:49.916
Oh, my God, those are lilies.
I'm allergic to lilies.

04:51.584 --> 04:53.544
I knew I remembered lilies for a reason.

04:53.628 --> 04:54.837
[chuckles]

04:54.921 --> 04:56.255
Just... You know what? Okay.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.217
There we go. [Chuckles]

04:59.300 --> 05:02.678
All right, that new Colt
starts now. [Chuckles]

05:02.762 --> 05:05.515
That was a very sweet
gesture. Thank you.

05:06.849 --> 05:07.892
Abby...

05:10.520 --> 05:12.188
you're the best thing in my life.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.316
And I know I'm not gonna
win you over in a day,

05:15.399 --> 05:16.526
but I'm gonna try...

05:16.609 --> 05:18.778
every day until I do.

05:21.072 --> 05:22.698
Means a lot that you said that.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.579
- Being the case... [grunts]
- Wait. Colt, hold on.

05:28.663 --> 05:31.833
Whoa, relax, if I was proposing, we'd
be in a luxury suite at Talladega.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.003
Abby Gail Phillips...

05:37.255 --> 05:38.422
will you go out with me?

05:39.799 --> 05:42.802
Wait. Do you think my
middle name is "Gail"?

05:43.427 --> 05:45.739
Yeah, that's what your Mom called
you when she was mad at you.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.098
"Abby Gail, get in here."

05:47.181 --> 05:48.683
My name's Abigail.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.467
That's what I said. Abby Gail.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.272
No. It's one word. Abigail.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.816
- Huh!
- [giggles]

05:56.899 --> 05:58.025
That's...

05:58.109 --> 06:00.278
Well, the new Colt starts now.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.257
I would love to go on a date with you.

06:03.281 --> 06:04.991
Fuck yeah! [Chuckles]

06:05.074 --> 06:06.635
But I gotta get going. I'm
gonna be late for school.

06:06.659 --> 06:07.844
All right. All right, you get going.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.954
[stammers] Get yourself
ready for something classy.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.582
I hope you like lobster. Red Lobster.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.543
Allergic to shellfish.

06:16.502 --> 06:19.463
The new Colt starts at
the Outback Steakhouse.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.053
So, how you boys doing?

06:27.263 --> 06:28.681
Dad won't let us buy semen.

06:31.726 --> 06:34.186
Wow. [Sighs] Where to begin?

06:35.229 --> 06:36.314
Bull semen, Ma.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.625
We wanna be in charge of
inseminating the herd this year,

06:38.649 --> 06:40.192
and Dad's being an asshole about it.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.862
[stammers] It ain't just
inseminating the cows.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.665
We... we run into Ed
Bishop the other day...

06:45.156 --> 06:46.883
and we were talking about
doing a deal with Neumann Hill.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.260
Dad won't even listen to our opinion.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.995
It's the same thing he was doing
when we brought up solar panels.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.080
Same thing when we talked
about expanding the herd.

06:53.164 --> 06:54.349
- Same thing.
- Same thing when we talked about

06:54.373 --> 06:56.292
- doing a kegerator on the porch.
- Same thing.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.255
Well, hang in there.

07:01.339 --> 07:03.799
It took me 40 years to figure
out how to get along with him.

07:03.883 --> 07:05.092
You're getting a divorce.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.776
Yeah. That's how you get along with him.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.738
How you getting along with that, anyway?

07:11.140 --> 07:12.892
All right.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.937
It's tough to close that door,
but I'm sure another one will open.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.355
Knock, knock.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.196
[Colt] Ah, shit.

07:26.948 --> 07:28.032
It's Kenny.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.660
Boy, that's too bad.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.996
Boy, that's too bad.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.539
The hell are you doing?

07:35.623 --> 07:37.959
Practicing for when
he tells us about Abby.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.587
Hey, Rooster. Colt.

07:41.671 --> 07:43.255
Hey. Kenny, how you doing?

07:43.339 --> 07:44.507
Ah, I'm all right.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.902
Hey, uh, I don't know if you
heard, but Abby and I broke up.

07:46.926 --> 07:48.302
Boy, that's too bad.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.556
Thanks.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.769
Yeah, you know, whoever,
uh, Abby ends up with next,

07:56.852 --> 07:58.604
man, that's gonna be a huge downgrade.

07:58.688 --> 07:59.814
Yeah.

08:01.232 --> 08:03.693
I don't know if he's
gonna be a huge downgrade.

08:03.776 --> 08:05.611
Oh, no, no. He'll be a fucking idiot.

08:07.947 --> 08:09.067
You guys wanna grab a table?

08:09.115 --> 08:11.534
Uh, actually, you know, we
gotta... we gotta get going.

08:11.617 --> 08:12.868
Oh. No, we don't.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.829
Come on, man. Our friend's hurtin'.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.041
Why you gotta be such an asshole?

08:19.125 --> 08:21.293
Oh, I don't "gotta be," I just enjoy it.

08:24.422 --> 08:27.049
All right, Ken-Dog. Give us the scoop.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.343
It just... happened out of nowhere.

08:29.427 --> 08:31.345
I mean, we were planning the wedding,

08:31.429 --> 08:33.431
we just sent out the
save-the-date cards and...

08:33.514 --> 08:34.741
and what am I supposed to do now?

08:34.765 --> 08:38.352
Send out "do whatever you want that date
'cause I'm not getting married" cards?

08:39.812 --> 08:42.940
I mean, the worst part is, I
don't even know why she did it.

08:43.024 --> 08:45.735
Yeah, I find it's better to not know.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.113
But the headline is "Move on."

08:51.365 --> 08:53.743
I wish I could, but
she's everywhere I look.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.870
Last night, I come home
from work, turn on the TV.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.372
What's on? A re-run of <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

08:59.749 --> 09:02.835
Last week, I was Lady
Mary, now I'm Lady Edith.

09:04.587 --> 09:05.671
That's...

09:05.755 --> 09:07.423
What the fuck channels you watch?

09:10.176 --> 09:11.886
Hey. You know what you need?

09:11.969 --> 09:13.429
ESPN.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.308
A guys' night.

09:18.017 --> 09:20.519
Oh, that'd be cool. I'm not
gonna have a bachelor party now.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.397
Yeah, man. Bachelor parties
are overrated anyway.

09:23.481 --> 09:24.815
I mean, once all the fun is done,

09:24.899 --> 09:26.668
you still gotta take that
stripper to the Walgreens,

09:26.692 --> 09:28.069
wait for her to pee on a stick.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.035
All right. Yeah. Let's do it.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.244
How about this weekend?

09:37.328 --> 09:39.056
Hell yeah, man. We're
gonna get fucking weird.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.581
Yeah, we are.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.249
You know, I...

09:42.333 --> 09:43.959
You guys... you guys have fun.

09:44.043 --> 09:45.878
It sounds awesome. I got plans, so...

09:45.961 --> 09:48.714
- What, you got a date?
- Yeah, Colt. You got a date?

09:50.883 --> 09:53.344
Do I? Did I get a date? [Stammers] No.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.639
I mean, well, I got a, uh, date
with a cow that needs inseminating.

09:59.058 --> 10:00.226
I mean, not by me.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.619
[stammering] I mean, sure, I'm
gonna put my arm up in there and...

10:05.564 --> 10:07.024
Do the...

10:07.108 --> 10:08.526
I got plans. So...

10:08.609 --> 10:10.736
Oh, come on, man.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.297
A night of drinking
without Colt Bennett?

10:12.321 --> 10:15.282
That's like <i>A Prairie Home
Companion</i> without Garrison Keillor.

10:17.493 --> 10:18.933
What the fuck channels do you watch?

10:24.917 --> 10:26.085
[vehicle approaching]

10:27.086 --> 10:28.838
Oh, well, Jerry's here.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.382
[sighs]

10:33.467 --> 10:35.427
I can't believe this.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.805
I didn't think I'd ever get a divorce.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.600
I didn't think I'd ever
let a lawyer on my property.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.107
Hey, Maggie. Good to see you.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.400
Don't shoot, Beau.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.195
Don't give me a reason to, Jerry.

10:53.279 --> 10:54.798
- [laughing] How are you?
- Good to see you. Good.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.448
- Whoa, huh?
- Yeah.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.742
Any luck, my nuts will thaw by April.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.329
[Jerry exclaims]

11:03.247 --> 11:07.209
I can't believe that it's been
so long since I've seen you both.

11:07.293 --> 11:10.421
Yeah. God, remember how our
boys loved playing together?

11:10.504 --> 11:11.606
- Yeah.
- How are yours doing?

11:11.630 --> 11:15.050
Yeah, well, um, Kevin
is an orthopedic surgeon.

11:15.134 --> 11:16.135
Thank you.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.970
And, um, Brett,

11:18.053 --> 11:21.765
he is, uh, working in one of those,
uh, start-up jobs in Silicon Valley.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.142
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:24.643 --> 11:25.936
How about Colt and Rooster?

11:28.063 --> 11:30.232
- The same.
- Oh.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.443
Well, great.

11:32.526 --> 11:36.113
Yeah, this shouldn't really take
long, should be pretty darn easy.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.700
I generally do wills.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.118
But this is sort of like,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.621
you know, the death of a
marriage, so... [laughing]

11:46.999 --> 11:49.999
If you don't like that, you're not gonna
like any of my other jokes, either.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.796
- I got one for you.
- Okay.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.965
What do they call a
lawyer at the gun range?

11:55.049 --> 11:56.091
A target.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.679
What do they call a lawyer
that ruins your damn joke?

12:00.763 --> 12:01.889
[chuckles]

12:01.972 --> 12:02.973
Well, you're...

12:03.057 --> 12:06.936
How about a rancher that tells you the
same damn joke every time he sees you?

12:08.771 --> 12:10.856
All right, huh? [Chuckles]

12:10.940 --> 12:11.982
Okay.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.527
Let's get down to some
business here. [Clears throat]

12:15.611 --> 12:16.987
Um...

12:17.071 --> 12:21.951
My understanding is that the
bar will remain in Maggie's name.

12:22.034 --> 12:25.454
And then, as... as far as the,
uh, ownership of the ranch.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.123
Maggie, you're just gonna
sign your half over to Beau.

12:29.208 --> 12:30.626
Actually, I've thought about it,

12:30.709 --> 12:33.295
and I want to give my
half to Colt and Rooster.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.256
You're gonna do what?

12:37.216 --> 12:38.467
[Jerry clears throat]

12:39.927 --> 12:42.179
It's my half, and I want
to give it to the boys.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.015
I'd rather you gave it to
the cows, they earned it.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.105
You know, actually, you can
leave money to an animal.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.942
There is a cat in Grand Junction,

12:55.025 --> 12:57.236
that is worth almost
half a million dollars.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.366
I thought this was gonna be easy.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.743
Well... [scoffs]
nothing with you is easy.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.328
Nothing with me is easy?

13:06.412 --> 13:09.915
I'll be lucky if you don't skip town
in the middle of this conversation.

13:12.418 --> 13:14.003
[sighs] You know what?

13:14.086 --> 13:17.715
I consider both of you to be friends,
but you guys are not on the same page.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.567
So I'm just gonna tell
you this straight away.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.719
[inhales] If you can't settle this,

13:21.802 --> 13:24.763
you're gonna have to sell
the ranch and split the money.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.890
We're on the same page.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.685
Just tell Maggie she can't
give her half to the boys.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.814
Except, actually, she can.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.691
Oh, shut the fuck up, Jerry.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.988
All right, I'm just gonna
bill this as a half hour,

13:41.071 --> 13:42.448
and I will talk to you later.

13:42.531 --> 13:45.659
No, no, Jerry, stay. We
have to get through this.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.454
If he's not gonna leave,
then I am. I'll see you.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.663
Yeah.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.460
- [sighs]
- So, uh...

13:55.127 --> 13:58.964
Which one is the doctor?
Uh, Colt or Rooster?

13:59.631 --> 14:01.467
Rooster. Dr. Rooster.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.058
You know the best thing about
these Dockers? Stain guard.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.851
You can spill pretty
much anything on 'em,

14:10.934 --> 14:12.936
it just wicks right off. Whoosh.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.229
- No shit.
- Yeah.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.900
Dude!

14:17.983 --> 14:21.320
Now, you got beer nuts. [Laughs]

14:21.403 --> 14:23.530
- Hey, guys.
- Oh-ho! There he is.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.783
Hey, and Colt's here.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.952
And he's drinking again,
and he's pissed his pants.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.556
- This is awesome.
- [Rooster chuckles]

14:31.705 --> 14:32.748
What's going on?

14:32.831 --> 14:34.124
Guys' night.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.168
- Tonight?
- [Rooster] Oh!

14:36.251 --> 14:37.544
Did I forget to mention that

14:37.628 --> 14:40.268
when I asked you if you had anything
to do tonight and you said no?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.509
- Definitely did not.
- Huh!

14:43.592 --> 14:44.736
Guys' night! Let's get weird.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.303
- Oh, let's get weird.
- Whoo-hoo!

14:46.387 --> 14:48.555
Yeah, yeah. Let's get weird.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.020
Joke's on you.

14:55.104 --> 14:56.647
Taught my dick how to drink beer.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.836
All right, boys. [Clears throat]

15:01.860 --> 15:04.196
We're gonna play a little
game called "Eraser."

15:04.279 --> 15:05.322
Uh, how does it work?

15:05.406 --> 15:06.490
Take a shot. [Sighs]

15:07.157 --> 15:08.283
Okay.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.038
- All right, now, who dumped you?
- Ugh! [Groans] Abby.

15:13.122 --> 15:14.289
Take another shot.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.669
- All right.
- Now, who dumped you?

15:19.545 --> 15:21.046
- Abby.
- [both] Drink.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.093
Oh, guys.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.321
I don't know if this is the
healthiest way to process this,

15:28.345 --> 15:30.472
but I'm having a lot of fun. [Chuckles]

15:30.556 --> 15:32.659
Look, man, this is what you
gotta do when you get dumped.

15:32.683 --> 15:35.561
Or so I assume, you know, the
Rooster's actually never been dumped.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.729
Bullshit.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.398
You've been dumped by a lot of girls.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.732
None that I remember.

15:40.816 --> 15:41.984
Thank you, Eraser.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.904
All right, what about Suzy Gardner?

15:45.988 --> 15:47.465
- [chuckles]
- Oh! Who's Suzy Gardner?

15:47.489 --> 15:48.824
Oh. Suzy Gardner, man.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.927
She's a chick who broke up
with me at the county fair.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.370
Tell you one thing, if you're
gonna cheat on your girlfriend,

15:53.454 --> 15:55.372
don't do it in a fun house.

15:55.456 --> 15:57.791
She saw it in, like,
72 different mirrors.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.126
[Kenny chuckles]

15:59.209 --> 16:01.253
I got dumped by a girl once,

16:01.336 --> 16:04.548
I went to the bar, got so drunk
the bartender had to take me home.

16:05.466 --> 16:07.384
She stayed the night. [Chuckles]

16:08.635 --> 16:10.888
That's awesome. I want
to do that tonight.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.558
Yeah, okay. Maybe not here.

16:15.309 --> 16:16.643
The bartender's our mom.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.398
- Yeah.
- So, what do you want to do, Kenny?

16:21.482 --> 16:22.566
Strip club?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.610
Indian casino? Gun range?

16:24.693 --> 16:27.905
Oh, Indian stripper in a gun range?

16:28.614 --> 16:29.823
Oh, I don't know about that.

16:29.907 --> 16:33.035
Fine. A "Native American"
stripper in a gun range?

16:34.328 --> 16:36.288
No, I know what I want to do.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.790
It's crazy. Illegal.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.667
And something we'll remember forever.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.586
I like the way this sounds.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.439
- I wanna go to the high school.
- [Rooster softly] Yeah?

16:44.463 --> 16:46.298
Break into Abby's classroom...

16:46.924 --> 16:50.385
and steal back my grandmother's
Precious Moments collectible figurine.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.221
[laughs]

16:57.559 --> 16:59.186
Maybe we should just let him fuck Mom.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.876
Chilly night.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.044
Yeah.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.422
Let's conserve our body
heat by not talking.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.007
I don't wanna fight.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.593
No, you just want to take
my ranch away from me.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.637
That's not true.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.766
I just think it's time
that Colt and Rooster...

17:37.849 --> 17:39.977
play a bigger role around here.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.564
You know, the other day,
Colt was sleeping in late.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.400
I went up to wake him up.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.944
He was wearing a cucumber facial mask.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.991
Said his skin dries out
in the harsh winter air.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.786
That's what I'm dealing with here.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.747
I'm not saying they're John Wayne.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.457
But they work hard...

18:02.541 --> 18:05.752
and they love this ranch
every bit as much as we do.

18:05.836 --> 18:06.837
And, by the way,

18:06.920 --> 18:10.007
John Wayne wore makeup every
day of his professional life.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.885
The only way John Wayne
had cucumber on his face

18:13.969 --> 18:16.096
is if he was punching a salad.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.349
The boys act like children.

18:19.433 --> 18:22.644
Well, if they do, it's
because you made them that way.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.439
No, no, no, don't lay that
pile of shit at my boots.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.942
Nobody forces them to stay
out all night drinking,

18:29.026 --> 18:31.695
and then spend all day talking about it.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.381
[imitating] "Remember how
much we drank last night?

18:33.405 --> 18:35.198
It was badass.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.034
Ha-ha-ha."

18:38.744 --> 18:40.662
You know, you hardly
let them do anything.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.206
And when you do, you just
tell them they did it wrong.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.417
That's because they do it wrong.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.461
How else are they gonna learn?

18:48.545 --> 18:50.672
Kids grow up when they have to.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.841
Like you did when your dad died.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.217
Damn right.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.304
And when he died, I
had no idea what to do.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.847
I just figured it out.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.475
[scoffs] But it doesn't
have to be that way.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.561
You don't have to die and
make them struggle like that.

19:04.645 --> 19:05.979
Teach them.

19:07.356 --> 19:09.066
Yeah...

19:09.149 --> 19:10.901
I think I'll just die.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.905
You know, you talk so
much about tradition

19:14.988 --> 19:17.491
and how badly you want this
ranch to stay in the family.

19:17.574 --> 19:21.370
And yet, you're not willing to do the
one thing that will make that happen.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.789
Oh, believe me, Maggie,

19:23.872 --> 19:25.457
when I'm gone...

19:25.540 --> 19:27.668
I'd love nothing more than to look down

19:27.751 --> 19:30.253
and see them running
this place the right way,

19:30.337 --> 19:32.297
but I'm not gonna hold my breath.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.758
How sweet, Beau...

19:34.841 --> 19:36.885
that you think you'll be looking down.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.313
[whispering] Yeah. This one's Abby's.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.610
Come on.

19:53.694 --> 19:55.821
[Colt straining] Well,
this is different.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.864
Sneaking into a school. [Grunts]

19:58.782 --> 20:00.617
[Rooster] Wait, hang
on. We forgot about Jack.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.080
Leave no man behind.

20:06.415 --> 20:09.167
[chuckling] It's so weird being
drunk in a high school classroom.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.970
[Rooster] Yeah. [Colt]
Yeah. Totally. It's...

20:13.338 --> 20:16.925
Look, they're studying the War of 1812.

20:17.008 --> 20:20.679
Yeah, most people don't know how closely
that's tied to the Napoleonic War.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.057
What? I know things.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.811
Look at this. Classic Abby.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.980
All the pens lined up, ready to go.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.692
So organized here, yet at home, none
of our chip bags have chip clips.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.776
None of 'em!

20:36.027 --> 20:37.529
Let it out, Kenny. Let it out.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.323
You know, before we grab
that figurine, let's, uh...

20:40.407 --> 20:41.825
let's break some stuff!

20:42.576 --> 20:43.869
Yeah, Kenny's a badass.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.872
Or... or we could go to other classrooms

20:46.955 --> 20:48.039
and break stuff in there,

20:48.123 --> 20:50.163
and then she's gotta deal
with her angry co-workers.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.768
She ain't gonna like sitting in
the teachers' lounge on that day.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.629
All right, all right, um...

20:54.713 --> 20:56.715
Well, come on, guys. We
gotta do something. Like...

20:56.798 --> 20:59.342
- Uh, what are you thinking?
- Uh...

20:59.426 --> 21:02.095
Ooh, let's rearrange the
order of the presidents!

21:03.513 --> 21:06.516
All right. Yeah. Hey, put that
Johnson in between those two Bushes.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.288
[Kenny] Guess what, Millard Fillmore?

21:10.312 --> 21:13.899
You are no longer the 13th
president, you are now the 32nd.

21:13.982 --> 21:17.694
Let's see you electrify
America's rural homes. Yeah!

21:17.778 --> 21:19.571
[laughing] Yeah, man. That's real fun.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.799
Hey, you know what else you
can do? Take a shit in her desk.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.242
- Yes.
- Dude.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.120
[stammers] Hey, all right, all
right... Nobody's shitting on anything.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.205
Come on.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.665
[Kenny] Oh, man. Look at this.

21:33.210 --> 21:36.254
It's a picture of when we
stayed at the Disneyland Resort.

21:36.338 --> 21:39.674
She told me she always wanted to go, so
I saved up for six months to take her.

21:39.758 --> 21:41.259
It was our four-year anniversary.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.387
Why would she do this?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.599
We were so good together.

21:47.682 --> 21:48.892
We never fought.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.062
She was my best friend.

21:54.773 --> 21:58.193
Let's just grab this figurine
and get on out of here, huh?

22:01.238 --> 22:04.157
When Meemaw gave this to me, she said...

22:04.241 --> 22:06.785
"Give this to the woman who
holds the key to your heart."

22:07.786 --> 22:09.120
Well, I did it, Meemaw.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.417
[clicks tongue] And she
broke that heart in half.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.337
You know who'd like that story?

22:17.420 --> 22:18.964
Native American stripper with an Uzi.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.427
Meemaw had an expression.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.596
[sighs]

22:26.680 --> 22:29.182
She'd say, "When you
find something you love...

22:29.266 --> 22:31.184
nothing can keep you from it."

22:31.268 --> 22:32.787
I mean, she was referring
to her cigarettes,

22:32.811 --> 22:34.062
but it still applies here.

22:36.398 --> 22:39.776
Maybe... maybe Abby was just
freaked out about the wedding.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.779
But we don't have to
get married, we just...

22:42.862 --> 22:44.549
We need to go back to the
way things were before.

22:44.573 --> 22:45.574
[Colt] Kenny...

22:46.741 --> 22:47.951
it's time to move on.

22:48.994 --> 22:50.036
No.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.621
No, Abby's my soulmate.

22:51.705 --> 22:53.582
Hey, hang on there, Ken-Dog.

22:53.665 --> 22:54.850
You know, here's what I'm thinking.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.876
I'm thinking we grab
this... this figurine,

22:56.960 --> 22:59.462
and we go buy some beers,
and maybe some chip clips.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.065
And we can eat as few chips as you want.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.649
You know what I mean? It'll be awesome.

23:03.883 --> 23:07.304
I appreciate this, you guys
are really good friends.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.388
But, uh...

23:09.180 --> 23:10.807
I'm going over there.

23:10.890 --> 23:11.975
I'm gonna get her back.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.272
Kenny. She broke up
with you to be with me.

23:22.527 --> 23:23.570
What?

23:23.653 --> 23:25.572
Yeah, what?

23:27.198 --> 23:30.118
We are both reacting
to this news right now.

23:32.704 --> 23:33.747
You and Abby...

23:35.624 --> 23:37.500
- Oh, my God.
- Kenny. Kenny.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.919
We... we didn't... plan on it,

23:40.003 --> 23:42.380
it just... kind of happened.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.175
Just kind of happened?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.720
What the hell are you talking
about? That doesn't just happen!

23:51.014 --> 23:52.265
I'm really sorry, Kenny.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.809
No...

23:54.893 --> 23:56.019
You're not sorry.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.480
This is who you are.

24:00.231 --> 24:03.068
Everybody told me, "Don't let
Colt Bennett near your girlfriend."

24:04.110 --> 24:05.546
And I was like, "No,
no, you don't know him.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.155
He's a good guy. He's my friend."

24:08.865 --> 24:10.450
Fuck you, Colt.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.495
[softly] I'm really sorry.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.231
You know what makes this even worse?

24:21.086 --> 24:22.504
Is that you're just gonna blow it.

24:24.172 --> 24:26.049
Just like every other
relationship you've had

24:26.132 --> 24:27.842
and when that happens...

24:27.926 --> 24:31.179
you'll have ruined my life
and Abby's life for nothing.

24:32.681 --> 24:34.140
I hope you're happy.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.943
How could you tell him?

24:46.277 --> 24:47.404
I had to.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.281
He was on his way over
here to beg to get you back

24:50.323 --> 24:52.992
- and, uh, I... I felt guilty.
- [sighs]

24:54.452 --> 24:55.578
I'm sorry.

24:55.662 --> 24:56.996
[stammering]

24:57.580 --> 24:59.874
I'm sorry, are you gonna
put a chip clip on that bag?

24:59.958 --> 25:01.438
'Cause them chips are gonna go stale.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.212
Damn it, Colt.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.547
Do you know what this means?

25:05.630 --> 25:08.133
Everyone in town is gonna
think I was hooking up with you

25:08.216 --> 25:09.300
while I was engaged to him.

25:09.384 --> 25:12.679
I might as well have a
huge red "A" on my chest.

25:12.762 --> 25:13.972
"A..."

25:15.014 --> 25:16.141
for Abby?

25:18.143 --> 25:20.395
No, <i>The Scarlet Letter.</i>

25:20.478 --> 25:21.730
Oh, right.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.649
I'm sorry... I don't know what that is.

25:25.525 --> 25:29.571
Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic
novel about shame and degradation?

25:29.654 --> 25:31.740
Don't anybody in this town have cable?

25:31.823 --> 25:32.991
[Abby groans]

25:33.074 --> 25:34.492
Abby, Abby. Abby.

25:34.576 --> 25:38.288
A year from now, no one's even
gonna remember any of this happened.

25:38.913 --> 25:42.143
[chuckles] They're gonna see us walking
down the street and they're gonna be like,

25:42.167 --> 25:43.835
"Oh, my God, there's Colt and Abby.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.004
[stammers] Boy, they're
gonna have beautiful kids.

25:46.087 --> 25:49.174
And look there. There's
Kenny and his accountant wife.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.761
It's so great that she
does Colt and Abby's taxes.

25:54.179 --> 25:55.531
'Cause they're just such good friends.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.682
Boy, everyone sure is happier this way."

25:59.309 --> 26:01.186
Oh, my God, and my parents.

26:01.311 --> 26:03.563
I mean, they already hate you so much.

26:04.397 --> 26:05.482
Your parents love me.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.692
No, they don't. They're just polite.

26:09.277 --> 26:10.528
And what are they gonna think

26:10.612 --> 26:12.840
when they hear that I broke
up with Kenny, who they love,

26:12.864 --> 26:14.532
to be with Colt Bennett, who they hate?

26:14.616 --> 26:17.035
Okay. I get it, your
parents aren't fans.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.244
That's...

26:21.331 --> 26:23.541
Are... are you having doubts about us?

26:23.625 --> 26:26.252
No. No. [Stammers] Of course not.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.339
- [sighs] Just...
- Hey.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.840
Hey...

26:33.426 --> 26:35.637
We're the only people
in this town that matter.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.183
It's just you and me.
We're on an island.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.519
But we're on it together.
And... [stammers]

26:42.602 --> 26:46.564
If you gotta wear a giant letter
"A," then I'll wear one, too.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.441
It'll stand for "Awesome."

26:51.110 --> 26:52.320
It's gonna be okay.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.323
You sure about that?

26:57.659 --> 26:58.993
[sighs]

27:03.081 --> 27:04.415
It's gonna be okay.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.501
Promise.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.086
Thank you.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.840
Hey.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.758
I just realized something.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.009
What?

27:15.844 --> 27:18.054
You better get to work early on Monday.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.389
Why?

27:19.472 --> 27:22.350
There's a bottle of Jack Daniel's
under one of your kid's desks.

27:28.231 --> 27:29.649
How was the rest of your night?

27:29.732 --> 27:30.793
- [Rooster chuckles]
- Hey, Pa.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.570
You ever have that dream where
you wake up naked in a classroom?

27:33.653 --> 27:34.946
[chuckles] Yeah, I got it.

27:35.029 --> 27:38.825
[laughing] Dad, you cannot believe
how much we drank last night.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.743
It was badass.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.416
I ever tell you about the
day your grandfather died?

27:47.166 --> 27:50.503
Oh, well, maybe not the best
time for a drinking story.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.757
That morning, an irrigation pipe burst.

27:55.967 --> 27:59.846
I was on my way down to shut off the
water and I heard a bull screaming.

28:01.848 --> 28:05.268
He smelled a cow in heat
and tried to jump the fence.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.354
Got all tangled up in the barbed wire.

28:09.522 --> 28:13.026
I had a pipe spraying water
and a bull spraying blood.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.739
'Bout that time, my old man showed up.

28:19.699 --> 28:20.909
Started yellin'.

28:21.951 --> 28:23.995
Telling me everything I was doing wrong.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.123
He do that a lot?

28:27.790 --> 28:29.500
Just about all the time.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.714
But that day, it was the
last thing I needed to hear.

28:35.632 --> 28:37.759
So I said, "If you don't
like the job I'm doing,

28:37.842 --> 28:39.344
fuckin' do it yourself."

28:40.595 --> 28:42.138
And I jumped in my truck...

28:42.222 --> 28:45.225
drove to the bar and started drinking.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.186
Couple of hours later, I come home...

28:49.479 --> 28:50.897
find my mother...

28:52.690 --> 28:54.317
sittin' on this porch.

28:56.444 --> 28:57.654
Crying.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.867
She said, "Your dad died."

29:05.620 --> 29:07.956
He had a heart attack out in that field,

29:08.039 --> 29:10.166
finishing the job that I wouldn't.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.335
Shit, Dad.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.338
After that, I had no choice.

29:16.256 --> 29:17.966
I had to become a good rancher.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.638
You boys haven't had that chance.

29:26.140 --> 29:29.185
You'd be better ranchers today
if I had died 20 years ago.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.728
Ain't true.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.230
Yeah, it is.

29:38.444 --> 29:42.615
It's about time I gave you boys
more responsibility around here.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.704
I'm putting you in charge
of inseminating the herd.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.206
- Yeah?
- Yep.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.501
I think you'll do a great job.

29:54.919 --> 29:58.798
Or you'll screw it up so bad,
I'll have a heart attack and die.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.719
Either way...

30:04.012 --> 30:05.847
not my fucking problem.

30:12.562 --> 30:14.605
