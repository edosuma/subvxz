WEBVTT

00:00.046 --> 00:01.494
You were playing
some insipid game

00:01.519 --> 00:03.987
on Robin Masters'
$100,000 computer system!

00:04.054 --> 00:05.352
When I entered my passcode,

00:05.423 --> 00:07.391
the computer said,
"Hi, Magnum, want to
finish our game?"

00:08.626 --> 00:10.958
Sometime within
the next 24 hours,

00:11.028 --> 00:14.054
I'll penetrate the estate,
enter the safe, and remove...

00:14.131 --> 00:15.120
<i>My ring.</i>

00:15.199 --> 00:17.429
The important thing is
we know someone's breaking in.

00:17.501 --> 00:19.992
It doesn't do us a bloody
bit of good if we don't know
where they are.

00:20.137 --> 00:23.470
Are you falling in love
with a man you only met
two days ago?

00:23.541 --> 00:24.530
Of course not.

00:24.609 --> 00:26.304
I think
you're dangerous enough
on your own.

00:26.377 --> 00:28.402
I'm just very good
at what I do.

03:32.548 --> 03:35.346
Good morning.
Please tell <i>Senor</i> Urrutio

03:35.418 --> 03:39.821
that Miss Villoroch has just
penetrated his impenetrable
security system.

03:48.464 --> 03:52.457
<i>Warning,</i>
<i>there is a red dragon</i>
<i>behind this door!</i>

04:07.517 --> 04:09.508
<i>Oops! Passageway blocked.</i>

04:09.585 --> 04:10.984
Damn!
<i>Try again.</i>

04:13.022 --> 04:14.148
Okay.

04:14.590 --> 04:15.750
Right.

04:23.933 --> 04:25.093
<i>False exit.</i>

04:25.168 --> 04:29.036
<i>There is a trap door</i>
<i>two steps in front of you.</i>

04:29.105 --> 04:32.836
Come on, I've been
trapped in this corridor
for over two hours!

04:33.142 --> 04:34.302
Okay.

04:34.977 --> 04:38.242
Secret door.

04:42.685 --> 04:43.811
<i>Wrong again.</i>

04:43.886 --> 04:46.912
<i>You have used all of</i>
<i>your warning wands.</i>

04:46.989 --> 04:50.152
<i>One more wrong choice</i>
<i>will unleash a white demon.</i>

04:51.627 --> 04:54.289
<i>Hurry, Magnum,</i>
<i>or you will forfeit the game.</i>

04:58.935 --> 05:01.802
Calm down, you little turkey.
Give me some time to think.

05:06.442 --> 05:07.807
Yeah.
- <i>Magnum?</i>

05:07.877 --> 05:09.606
Mac?
- <i>Dungeon Master says</i>

05:09.679 --> 05:12.375
Wait, I can't.
<i>...you have 10 seconds.</i>
<i>9, 8,</i>

05:12.448 --> 05:15.383
You're where? Wait...
Hold on, hold on.
<i>7, 6, 5,</i>

05:15.785 --> 05:19.243
<i>4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

05:19.489 --> 05:21.286
<i>Too late, you lose!</i>

05:29.699 --> 05:31.894
Drop dead!

05:43.646 --> 05:45.045
Uh-oh.

05:49.085 --> 05:50.074
Uh-oh.

05:50.186 --> 05:52.245
<i>Magnum,</i>
<i>are you still there?</i>

05:53.156 --> 05:54.885
<i>I'm in big trouble.</i>

06:00.196 --> 06:01.925
<i>My Aunt Mildred once said,</i>

06:01.998 --> 06:06.435
<i>"The only difference</i>
<i>between men and boys is</i>
<i>the kind of games they play."</i>

06:06.602 --> 06:09.196
<i>All right, maybe I should have</i>
<i>gone to Higgins and told him</i>

06:09.272 --> 06:10.933
<i>I'd crashed</i>
<i>the security system</i>

06:11.007 --> 06:13.407
<i>trying to beat</i>
<i>the Dungeon Master,</i>

06:13.476 --> 06:17.913
<i>but Mac's call for help</i>
<i>took priority over some</i>
<i>tangled-up computer program.</i>

06:17.980 --> 06:20.346
<i>Besides, I figured</i>
<i>a drive in the night air</i>

06:20.416 --> 06:23.476
<i>might help me</i>
<i>figure out some way</i>
<i>of reprogramming it.</i>

06:25.087 --> 06:27.817
<i>Mac said he'd been arrested</i>
<i>for selling stolen goods.</i>

06:27.890 --> 06:30.222
<i>Now, I think I know enough</i>
<i>about Mac to believe</i>

06:30.293 --> 06:32.420
<i>that he might con the shirt</i>
<i>off your back,</i>

06:32.495 --> 06:34.588
<i>but I don't think</i>
<i>he'd ever steal it.</i>

06:35.464 --> 06:36.692
<i>I think.</i>

06:38.401 --> 06:40.028
Hey, Magnum.

06:40.503 --> 06:41.800
This guy said
he's a friend of yours.

06:41.871 --> 06:43.736
Thomas, am I glad
to see you.

06:43.806 --> 06:45.034
There's been
a terrible mistake here.

06:45.107 --> 06:47.268
The only mistake
is your possession
of stolen property.

06:47.343 --> 06:50.540
But I didn't know
it was stolen.
Tell him, Magnum.

06:51.214 --> 06:53.739
John, look, I have known Mac
for some time now, and...

06:53.816 --> 06:55.681
Then you know
that Mac's not
his real name.

06:55.751 --> 06:57.651
Yeah, of course,
it's his nickname.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.187
His real name
is Jim Bonig.

06:59.255 --> 07:02.452
His ID says Peter Kernan.

07:02.892 --> 07:04.723
You see, I explained
to the officer
that I was doing

07:04.794 --> 07:06.489
some surveillance work
for you
and that we decided...

07:06.562 --> 07:07.586
You what?

07:07.663 --> 07:09.187
It's not important.

07:09.265 --> 07:10.527
The point is,
I didn't steal this stuff.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.967
Now, there was a kid,
12 years old,
stopped by my stand...

07:14.036 --> 07:16.561
A stand for which
you did not have
an operator's license.

07:16.639 --> 07:18.937
Well, of course not,
because I wasn't really
selling anything.

07:19.008 --> 07:20.999
I was working undercover
for Magnum.
That's it, Mac!

07:21.077 --> 07:24.843
Anyway, this kid offers me
a great deal on this
bauble jewelry stuff.

07:24.914 --> 07:26.973
Says he got it directly
from the manufacturers,

07:27.049 --> 07:29.142
said he had papers
and everything to prove it.

07:29.352 --> 07:31.877
Computerized forgeries,
which I think
you are guilty of.

07:31.954 --> 07:33.387
That's ridiculous!

07:33.689 --> 07:37.250
John, could I talk
to Mac...

07:37.326 --> 07:39.260
Jim... Him, alone?

07:43.833 --> 07:46.666
Hey,
I didn't steal that stuff.

07:47.136 --> 07:49.161
Just tell me
the truth, Mac.

07:49.238 --> 07:51.468
Well, it's the only
fair thing I could do.

07:51.540 --> 07:54.839
I mean, that junk jewelry
had been stuck in Customs
for a year.

07:54.910 --> 07:58.004
Harlen found out that
it was about to be sold
at auction for its duty,

07:58.080 --> 08:00.173
so I liberated it.

08:00.249 --> 08:02.012
I hate that word.

08:02.451 --> 08:06.387
But what I need to know
is, did you use a computer
to forge those documents?

08:11.894 --> 08:14.192
Yes. I bypassed
the dock entry code

08:14.263 --> 08:15.730
and I programmed
the shipping bills,

08:15.798 --> 08:17.060
turning the jewelry
over to Harlen.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.930
Then you know
how to program a computer?

08:19.568 --> 08:22.332
Well, I can get you a ticket
to just about any place
in the world.

08:22.405 --> 08:24.464
I can add a couple of zeros
to your bank account.

08:24.540 --> 08:27.031
I can probably even
erase your bill down
at the phone company.

08:27.109 --> 08:29.168
Yeah, I guess you could say
I can program a computer.

08:29.245 --> 08:32.043
How about a computerized
security system?

08:34.317 --> 08:35.510
What are you up to?

08:36.652 --> 08:41.554
I crashed the estate
security system computer.

08:41.756 --> 08:44.817
You? How'd you do that?

08:44.994 --> 08:47.622
Never mind.
What I need to do is

08:47.697 --> 08:51.258
get it back online before
Higgins or the insurance
company find out.

08:51.334 --> 08:54.167
Insurance company?
Magnum, what's going on?

08:58.274 --> 08:59.901
This is a secret.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.138
My lips are sealed.

09:02.311 --> 09:03.335
In two days,

09:03.412 --> 09:07.371
a $170 million
jewelry competition

09:07.450 --> 09:08.644
is going to be held
at the estate.

09:08.718 --> 09:10.982
$170 million...
Shh.

09:11.053 --> 09:12.884
170 million bucks?

09:12.955 --> 09:14.252
Can you do it?

09:16.158 --> 09:17.716
Do what?
Reprogram the...

09:22.798 --> 09:24.265
...computer.

09:27.303 --> 09:28.497
Yeah.

09:29.138 --> 09:31.606
But I can't do anything
from jail.

09:32.908 --> 09:35.035
Well, this doesn't mean
I condone what you did.

09:35.111 --> 09:38.547
I didn't do anything!
I liberated junk that was
being sold at auction...

09:43.386 --> 09:44.853
John,

09:45.054 --> 09:48.490
Mac, he is willing to
admit that he's guilty...

09:48.557 --> 09:51.390
What?
...of operating a stand
without a license.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.690
The charge is possession
of stolen goods.

09:53.763 --> 09:56.197
Yeah, which are now
in your possession, John,

09:56.265 --> 09:58.961
and they're probably
not worth more than
a hundred bucks.

10:00.302 --> 10:02.065
A lot of paperwork...

10:04.974 --> 10:06.703
I release him
into your custody?

10:06.776 --> 10:07.765
Of course.

10:07.843 --> 10:10.505
If I so much as catch him
spitting on a sidewalk.

10:10.579 --> 10:12.046
I never spit.

10:13.682 --> 10:16.947
Operating without
a vendor's license
is a $300 fine.

10:19.188 --> 10:20.553
Pay him, Mac.

10:20.623 --> 10:23.490
Magnum, Magnum,

10:25.127 --> 10:26.651
I don't have 300 bucks.

10:29.965 --> 10:32.866
<i>It took my entire</i>
<i>ready-teller account</i>
<i>to get Mac out,</i>

10:32.935 --> 10:35.096
<i>but it was worth it</i>
<i>if he could fix</i>
<i>the Dracos Three</i>

10:35.170 --> 10:36.797
<i>before Higgins found out.</i>

10:37.673 --> 10:40.233
I was surprised
when your insurance company
informed me

10:40.309 --> 10:43.369
that you were coming
to inspect our security
system, Miss Villoroch.

10:43.445 --> 10:44.707
Surprised?

10:44.780 --> 10:49.547
Well, under the circumstances,
one is not usually afforded
the opportunity to prepare.

10:50.586 --> 10:51.746
I see.

10:59.495 --> 11:03.591
Excuse me. One can't be
too careful, can one?

11:18.347 --> 11:19.780
Oh, my God.

11:19.848 --> 11:22.874
I penetrated the grounds
at 0500 hours this morning.

11:22.951 --> 11:23.975
From there
to the main house,

11:24.053 --> 11:25.782
it took me
12 minutes to locate
the electronic system

11:25.854 --> 11:28.379
and bypass any connection
that might sound the alarm.

11:28.457 --> 11:32.086
I used a sonic pulser
to vibrate the electronic
locks open.

11:32.695 --> 11:34.253
At 0523,

11:34.997 --> 11:37.329
I located the safe,
opened it,

11:37.399 --> 11:39.390
and removed the contents.

11:40.102 --> 11:43.503
All of Mr. Masters'
personal papers are here,
unread, of course.

11:44.206 --> 11:47.664
But I couldn't resist
the last chapter
of his new novel.

11:49.478 --> 11:50.911
Good ending.

11:51.180 --> 11:52.772
I'll have to buy the book.

11:54.016 --> 11:55.847
This is impossible.

11:56.118 --> 11:59.986
The Dracos Three
computer system is the most
advanced in the world.

12:00.089 --> 12:02.148
Yes. When it's activated.

12:07.396 --> 12:09.159
I'm afraid I will have
to inform my superiors

12:09.231 --> 12:12.792
that this estate is inadequate
for the requirements
of their jewelry competition.

12:16.038 --> 12:18.165
<i>Just a minute, Higgins.</i>

12:19.374 --> 12:20.568
Magnum!

12:21.543 --> 12:23.875
Why was the Dracos Three
not activated last night?

12:23.946 --> 12:26.380
I can explain that.
See, I was having
a little problem.

12:26.448 --> 12:28.040
Problem? Problem?

12:28.117 --> 12:31.553
Well, I was running
a routine check of the guests
for the competition and...

12:31.620 --> 12:32.712
And?

12:33.088 --> 12:35.488
And it broke.

12:38.961 --> 12:40.690
Oh, my God!

12:41.497 --> 12:43.055
It's not that bad, Higgins.

12:43.132 --> 12:45.464
You've crashed
the Dracos Three!

12:46.435 --> 12:48.096
You were playing
games again.

12:49.404 --> 12:50.428
Games?

12:50.506 --> 12:51.700
Don't lie to me,
Magnum.

12:51.774 --> 12:53.241
You were playing
some insipid game

12:53.308 --> 12:56.300
on Robin Masters'
$100,000 computer system!

12:57.112 --> 12:58.739
It made me do it!
It what?

12:58.814 --> 13:00.907
It made me do it!
It made you do it?

13:00.983 --> 13:02.780
I came in here
to do my nightly check

13:02.851 --> 13:04.011
and when I entered
my passcode,

13:04.086 --> 13:06.384
the computer said,
"Hi, Magnum, want to
finish our game?"

13:06.455 --> 13:08.685
You said you had erased
all those games.

13:08.757 --> 13:10.315
Well, I must have
missed one.

13:10.492 --> 13:14.155
Don't worry, Higgins, I'll
have this thing reprogrammed
before the competition.

13:14.229 --> 13:16.356
You told him? Him?

13:16.431 --> 13:19.696
Well, I had no choice.
It had to be reprogrammed
before it was too late.

13:19.768 --> 13:21.429
It is already too late!

13:21.503 --> 13:23.403
A representative of
the insurance company

13:23.472 --> 13:24.996
breached the estate
last night,

13:25.073 --> 13:26.438
including the safe.

13:26.508 --> 13:28.100
They won't insure
the competition,

13:28.177 --> 13:29.974
so there will be
no competition.

13:30.045 --> 13:31.979
And it's all your fault!

13:38.002 --> 13:40.698
<i>Mac and I managed</i>
<i>to calm Higgins down.</i>

13:40.771 --> 13:43.535
<i>Well, maybe "calm"</i>
<i>wasn't the right word,</i>

13:43.774 --> 13:45.765
<i>but at least</i>
<i>he stopped yelling.</i>

13:45.843 --> 13:48.437
<i>We convinced him</i>
<i>that Mac would be able</i>
<i>to reprogram the system</i>

13:48.512 --> 13:50.571
<i>in time for the competition.</i>

13:50.648 --> 13:54.106
<i>Now, the only thing</i>
<i>I had to do was</i>
<i>convince Miss Villoroch</i>

13:54.185 --> 13:56.983
<i>not to pull the competition</i>
<i>from the estate.</i>

13:57.054 --> 13:59.215
<i>Rick told me to look</i>
<i>for a snowflake</i>

13:59.323 --> 14:02.349
<i>who double-billed</i>
<i>as the ice princess.</i>

14:10.134 --> 14:12.034
Miss Villoroch?

14:13.104 --> 14:14.162
Yes.

14:16.707 --> 14:18.072
My name is Thomas Magnum,

14:18.142 --> 14:21.737
and I sort of
help with security
at the Masters Estate.

14:24.382 --> 14:25.371
Oh.

14:27.451 --> 14:31.547
Well, Higgins told me
that you were staying at
the Club and I thought that...

14:31.622 --> 14:33.954
You thought
that you could talk me
out of filing my report.

14:34.025 --> 14:35.515
Well, you're wasting
your time.

14:36.794 --> 14:38.284
I think it's best
for all concerned

14:38.362 --> 14:40.694
that the competition
be moved somewhere
more secure.

14:40.765 --> 14:44.531
There is nowhere more secure
on the entire Island
than Robin's Nest.

14:44.602 --> 14:45.694
Really?

14:45.770 --> 14:48.500
Yes, really.
And if you would
just stop a minute

14:48.572 --> 14:50.199
and listen to me,

14:50.942 --> 14:52.705
I could tell you that,
number one,

14:52.777 --> 14:54.267
you don't have
all the facts,

14:54.345 --> 14:56.575
and number two,
in my opinion,

14:56.647 --> 14:59.673
your little surprise visit
to the estate
was totally unfair.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.116
I don't think that fairness
has anything to do
with the fact

15:02.186 --> 15:04.848
that the estate
has inadequate security.

15:04.922 --> 15:07.356
But the security computer
was down.

15:07.858 --> 15:09.689
Excuses don't pay
insurance claims.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.160
Okay, okay, you're right.
You're right.

15:12.229 --> 15:14.459
But I think
the important thing
to remember here is

15:14.532 --> 15:18.366
there was no way
that you would have been
able to penetrate the estate

15:18.469 --> 15:20.266
if the computer
was functioning.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.805
I wouldn't?

15:24.175 --> 15:25.665
No, you wouldn't.

15:25.743 --> 15:27.233
Is that a challenge?

15:29.180 --> 15:30.238
Yes.

15:30.815 --> 15:32.214
Accepted.

15:32.450 --> 15:34.850
Sometime within
the next 24 hours,

15:34.919 --> 15:38.047
I'll penetrate the estate,
enter the safe,

15:38.322 --> 15:40.790
and remove what?

15:42.660 --> 15:43.888
My ring.

15:44.428 --> 15:45.759
Done.
Good.

15:48.299 --> 15:49.823
Miss Villoroch?

15:51.202 --> 15:54.501
There's a dinner
for the designers
and judges

15:54.572 --> 15:55.971
at the Club tonight.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.632
Would you like to go
as my guest?

15:58.843 --> 16:01.107
Why would you want
to ask me to dinner?

16:03.314 --> 16:07.216
Well, that way I'd know
you wouldn't be breaking
into the estate.

16:10.021 --> 16:11.113
8:00?

16:35.346 --> 16:36.438
Will you stop that?

16:36.514 --> 16:39.142
I can't concentrate
with you pacing up and down
like a lion in heat.

16:39.216 --> 16:40.376
Really?

16:40.651 --> 16:42.881
What are you worried
about, Higgins?

16:42.953 --> 16:45.251
Magnum got her to hold off
calling the insurance company

16:45.322 --> 16:47.085
and I got this thing
accepting data.

16:47.158 --> 16:49.592
Just a matter of time
before I'll have this baby
good as new.

16:49.660 --> 16:53.152
And if it isn't, I shall have
to inform Mr. Masters
that his jewelry competition,

16:53.230 --> 16:56.495
the Robin Masters'
International Design
Competition,

16:56.567 --> 16:59.092
will not take place
at the Robin Masters Estate.

16:59.870 --> 17:03.431
Well, Higgins, you know
my motto, "Life is hard,
and then you die."

17:04.340 --> 17:05.933
That's positively
dysphoric.

17:06.010 --> 17:06.999
Hi, guys.

17:09.847 --> 17:11.541
Hey, you look terrific.

17:11.615 --> 17:12.638
Thanks.

17:12.715 --> 17:14.240
What are you doing
in a tuxedo?

17:15.286 --> 17:17.584
I'm going
to the opening dinner for
the jewelry competition.

17:17.655 --> 17:18.644
You're what?

17:18.722 --> 17:22.385
I'm going to the dinner,
and, Higgins, I am taking
Krista Villoroch.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.587
Well, that's
the most absurd thing
I've ever heard.

17:24.662 --> 17:27.028
Why on earth
would you wanna take her
to the competition dinner?

17:27.098 --> 17:28.998
And more importantly,
if you do go,

17:29.066 --> 17:31.193
who's going to stay here
and watch him?

17:32.603 --> 17:34.366
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

17:34.438 --> 17:37.100
I don't need anybody
to stay here with me.

17:37.174 --> 17:39.540
I mean, I don't want
a watchdog looking
over my shoulder.

17:39.610 --> 17:42.170
I mean, here I am,
spending my own time,

17:42.246 --> 17:47.206
helping you two protect
$170 million worth of jewelry,

17:47.284 --> 17:50.913
and you treat me
like a criminal,
a common criminal.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.852
You're right, Higgins.
One of us has to stay.

17:56.927 --> 17:58.155
Precisely.

17:59.130 --> 18:00.461
Now that we've reached
an understanding,

18:00.531 --> 18:02.624
I estimate
that I shall be home
around 11:30.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.928
No!

18:04.001 --> 18:05.969
Wait a minute,
I have to go.

18:06.036 --> 18:07.970
As the curator
of Robin Masters Estate,

18:08.038 --> 18:10.802
it is my obligation
to represent him
at the opening dinner.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.207
Higgins, I am taking Krista

18:13.277 --> 18:15.370
so that I can
keep an eye on her.

18:15.446 --> 18:19.405
As long as we're together,
she can't very well break
into the estate, now can she?

18:22.186 --> 18:23.448
I suppose you're right.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.216
You know I'm right.

18:25.289 --> 18:27.086
Then I shall escort
Miss Villoroch to dinner.

18:27.158 --> 18:29.888
No! Now, wait.
Wait a minute.
I mean, you can't.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.258
I mean, well,
I mean, I have to.

18:32.596 --> 18:35.030
I mean, she practically
begged me to take her.

18:35.099 --> 18:38.535
I mean, how would it look
if you showed up
instead of me?

18:38.869 --> 18:40.166
If she has
any sensitivities,

18:40.237 --> 18:41.795
like a stroke of
incredible luck.

18:41.872 --> 18:42.861
No!

18:43.140 --> 18:46.632
I mean, come on, Higgins,
what if you can't
keep her there?

18:47.211 --> 18:50.612
I mean, what if she left
the dinner and came back
and broke into the estate

18:50.681 --> 18:51.978
before the Dracus Three
was functioning?

18:52.049 --> 18:53.038
Dracos.
Dracus.

18:53.117 --> 18:54.141
Dracos.
Whatever.

18:54.218 --> 18:57.654
Anyway, look, I mean,
she'd have to withdraw
the competition,

18:57.721 --> 18:59.780
and you'd have
to tell Robin.

19:01.192 --> 19:02.625
Magnum, why do
I have the impression

19:02.693 --> 19:05.025
that your sudden enthusiasm
for the estate's security

19:05.095 --> 19:06.926
has something to do
with the fact
that Miss Villoroch

19:06.997 --> 19:08.328
is a beautiful woman?

19:10.701 --> 19:13.363
Higgins, please,
this is strictly business.

19:13.437 --> 19:15.064
It had better be.

19:15.406 --> 19:17.067
And you call me a con man.

19:19.009 --> 19:21.978
I'm running a little late.
Would you put that
in the safe, please?

19:22.046 --> 19:24.514
This? With the caliber
of jewelry at the dinner,

19:24.582 --> 19:26.243
who on earth would want
to steal this?

19:26.317 --> 19:28.717
Krista. I bet her
she couldn't. Bye, guys.

19:54.378 --> 19:58.041
Why do I get the feeling
you're not having
a wonderful time?

19:58.115 --> 20:00.140
I assure you,
it has nothing to do
with the company.

20:00.217 --> 20:01.548
It's them.

20:01.619 --> 20:05.316
Something about them
makes me, I don't know,
uncomfortable.

20:05.623 --> 20:08.990
You know, I've been
trying to figure out
who they are.

20:10.527 --> 20:14.258
Cartier, Tiffany, Bulgari.

20:15.432 --> 20:19.368
You name any major jeweler,
and I assure you
they're represented here.

20:19.436 --> 20:22.200
You see that woman
over there?
In the burgundy dress?

20:22.273 --> 20:23.262
Where?

20:23.374 --> 20:25.774
With the diamond choker.
Oh, yeah.

20:25.843 --> 20:27.811
That's the Countess
Carolyn Lysanne,

20:27.878 --> 20:30.346
one of the few successful
independent designers.

20:30.414 --> 20:32.746
She only designs
for her friends,

20:33.484 --> 20:35.611
a dark horse
in the competition.

20:35.686 --> 20:37.381
She's a dark horse?

20:37.454 --> 20:40.787
It's all politics.
Take the man next to her,
Karl Vandercliff.

20:41.659 --> 20:44.492
He and his wife
have won this competition
three years running.

20:44.561 --> 20:46.756
He finds the stones
and she designs the pieces.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.627
Well, that sounds like
a very nice arrangement.

20:48.699 --> 20:51.998
It's the stones that count.
They own several
South African diamond mines,

20:52.069 --> 20:54.060
and have
one of the largest
private collections

20:54.138 --> 20:55.833
of rare old stones
in the world.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.340
I thought all diamonds
were old and rare.

20:58.409 --> 21:00.343
I mean, stones that have been
passed around for centuries.

21:00.411 --> 21:02.777
I know that.
It was just a joke.

21:03.614 --> 21:05.377
You mean,
like the Hope Diamond?

21:05.449 --> 21:07.178
And the Star of Tibet.

21:07.251 --> 21:08.275
And

21:09.420 --> 21:12.355
the one they have set
for this year's competition,

21:12.423 --> 21:13.822
the Karachi Diamond.

21:13.891 --> 21:15.950
It must be
4,000 years old.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.857
Krista Villoroch,
I can't believe

21:17.928 --> 21:20.192
you have the nerve
to show your face here!

21:20.264 --> 21:23.427
Lenor, a pleasure as always.

21:24.335 --> 21:27.065
I think it best
if you leave now, Krista.

21:27.504 --> 21:30.098
Excuse me,
Miss Villoroch is my guest.

21:30.908 --> 21:34.400
Then I suggest
you find out a little more
about the company you keep.

21:34.478 --> 21:37.879
Like the fact that her father
is a professional jewel thief.

21:40.851 --> 21:42.318
He's retired.

21:42.419 --> 21:45.855
Well, then I suppose
you're here to continue
the family business?

21:47.558 --> 21:49.549
I don't condone
my father's past,

21:50.160 --> 21:53.288
but I'm not gonna spend
the rest of my life
apologizing for it.

21:54.264 --> 21:56.289
Now, get out of my way
before I forget I'm a lady

21:56.367 --> 21:57.891
and throw this drink
in your face.

21:58.335 --> 21:59.632
You wouldn't dare.

22:06.243 --> 22:08.143
Sorry. Excuse me.

22:22.393 --> 22:23.792
You all right?

22:23.861 --> 22:25.453
I think it best
if you just left me alone.

22:25.529 --> 22:27.087
I don't wanna
just leave you alone,

22:27.164 --> 22:28.825
I wanna know
if you're all right.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.831
I will be.

22:42.179 --> 22:44.044
I'm sorry about
what happened back there.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.014
I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you.

22:46.083 --> 22:49.712
I'm even sorry she happened
to be one of the people
my father robbed.

22:49.787 --> 22:52.551
Well, it's like you said,

22:54.091 --> 22:56.150
that's his past,
not yours.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.357
Not many people
see it like that.

22:59.696 --> 23:01.891
Oh, so your dad
did teach you.

23:03.066 --> 23:06.001
It must have been
an exciting way
to grow up.

23:06.203 --> 23:07.397
It was.

23:09.206 --> 23:12.403
When I first found out
about Doc being a thief,
I was embarrassed.

23:12.910 --> 23:15.504
Off in an expensive school
in Europe,

23:15.579 --> 23:18.173
rubbing elbows
with the wealthiest kids
in the world,

23:18.248 --> 23:20.409
whilst my father was
robbing their parents.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.952
Well, at least you knew
they hung around
in the same circles.

23:30.527 --> 23:32.222
It really doesn't
bother you, does it?

23:32.563 --> 23:34.531
That your father was
a jewel thief, no.

23:36.099 --> 23:38.124
Because you're not.

23:41.038 --> 23:42.528
I could have been.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.767
Doc was the best.

23:45.209 --> 23:46.801
He taught me everything.

23:48.745 --> 23:50.645
Now, I know
there's a segue

23:50.714 --> 23:53.808
into insurance investigator
in here somewhere.

23:54.651 --> 23:56.346
That was Doc's idea.

23:56.753 --> 24:00.120
He made me promise
never to use what he had
taught me to steal.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.748
So he contacted
the head of Wakeman,

24:01.825 --> 24:03.554
and made them an offer
they couldn't refuse.

24:03.627 --> 24:05.322
Precautionary investigator.

24:06.330 --> 24:08.423
I've saved them a fortune
in claim payments.

24:10.133 --> 24:12.192
And at the same time,

24:14.204 --> 24:16.468
you get the thrill
of the heist.

24:17.074 --> 24:18.132
No.

24:19.243 --> 24:20.608
No thrills.

24:21.845 --> 24:24.712
There's something
about knowing you have
to give it all back

24:25.449 --> 24:27.076
that takes the danger away.

24:30.420 --> 24:31.910
Well, somehow,

24:32.923 --> 24:35.084
I think
you're dangerous enough
on your own.

24:37.060 --> 24:40.325
I'm just very good
at what I do.

25:03.552 --> 25:05.144
<i>Got an intruder</i>
<i>in area 7.</i>

25:05.221 --> 25:06.210
It works!

25:06.288 --> 25:07.983
Only if the intruder
is a ghost.

25:08.057 --> 25:10.218
The cameras aren't
picking anyone up
in Area 7.

25:10.292 --> 25:11.452
That's impossible.

25:11.527 --> 25:14.155
Well, the important thing is,
we know someone's breaking in.

25:14.230 --> 25:17.996
It doesn't do us a bloody
bit of good if we don't know
where they are.

25:22.905 --> 25:24.133
You haven't opened
the lock yet?

25:24.206 --> 25:25.605
I'm hooked.

25:34.583 --> 25:36.016
Come on,
just tear it off.

25:36.085 --> 25:37.712
This is one of my best
cashmere sweaters.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.153
I'm not gonna tear it
any more than
it's already torn.

25:40.222 --> 25:42.952
You wore a cashmere sweater
to a break in?

25:43.025 --> 25:45.084
It was the only black sweater
that I had.

25:45.161 --> 25:47.220
The point is
that all the sensors

25:47.296 --> 25:49.321
have been connected
to the wrong computer inputs.

25:49.398 --> 25:51.263
It's a minor
miscalculation.

25:51.333 --> 25:54.359
As Magnum says,
the important thing is,
is that the system works.

25:54.437 --> 25:57.702
Except for the fact
that we now have to figure out
what's connected to what.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.172
Guys, please!

26:00.109 --> 26:02.202
This was
my favorite sweater.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.207
Bootsie gave this to me
on our anniversary.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.612
I don't think three weeks
constitutes an anniversary.

26:06.682 --> 26:08.377
Hey, what do you know?
I bet a woman
never gave you

26:08.451 --> 26:09.975
an expensive gift
in your life.

26:10.052 --> 26:11.952
T. C: Drop it, Orville.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.449
Will you come on?
Open it, will you?
Open it!

26:15.524 --> 26:18.721
I'm gonna open your nose
with those pliers,
if you don't shut up.

26:26.402 --> 26:29.303
You'd think Thomas
would have left the lock
off for us.

26:33.042 --> 26:34.475
T. C: Damn!
What?

26:34.543 --> 26:35.737
He did.

26:39.648 --> 26:42.549
Now, look what you did!
You broke the little contact
that hooks up to the thingy.

26:42.618 --> 26:44.051
You're the one who
opened the window!

26:44.120 --> 26:46.554
Good.
Now, you have 10 seconds
to type in the code

26:46.622 --> 26:47.953
before the alarm goes off.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.115
Code?

26:49.592 --> 26:51.355
You didn't program in
a reset code?

26:51.427 --> 26:53.395
I'm doing it now.

26:53.462 --> 26:54.622
It won't accept
the code!

26:54.697 --> 26:57.222
Well, of course
it won't accept the code,
it's in alarm mode!

26:57.299 --> 26:58.994
That means the police
are getting an alarm!

26:59.068 --> 27:01.263
I'll phone the police
and let them know.

27:04.673 --> 27:06.698
What now?
The lines are dead!

27:07.977 --> 27:10.639
Thomas, you owe me
200 bucks for
a new sweater!

27:11.514 --> 27:12.674
What?

27:13.149 --> 27:15.549
You owe me 200 bucks
for a new sweater!

27:15.618 --> 27:17.085
Can't you turn
this thing off?

27:17.153 --> 27:18.211
No!

27:18.287 --> 27:19.515
Do something...

27:19.588 --> 27:22.079
<i>I thought things like that</i>
<i>only happened in movies.</i>

27:22.158 --> 27:23.955
Only in
Marx Brothers movies.

27:24.026 --> 27:28.190
But when you're dealing
with my crack security team,
anything is likely to happen.

27:28.264 --> 27:29.424
Oh, I wouldn't
say that.

27:29.498 --> 27:31.159
You're very good
at what you do.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.360
When you don't
allow distractions
to get in the way.

27:33.435 --> 27:34.697
Distractions?

27:34.770 --> 27:36.431
Games, friends...

27:37.072 --> 27:39.336
A beautiful woman
on the beach?

27:42.011 --> 27:43.273
You know,

27:43.979 --> 27:45.879
it's my mistake, I...

27:46.849 --> 27:49.044
I thought we were
going riding to spend
some time together.

27:49.118 --> 27:51.814
I didn't realize this was
a distraction maneuver.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.387
Who's distracting who?

27:56.826 --> 27:58.885
As long as I'm here,
your ring is safe.

28:01.931 --> 28:03.421
So, we're just playing games?

28:04.200 --> 28:06.498
I never play
games of the heart.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.131
Just games of the head?

28:09.572 --> 28:10.937
Just the making of
a wonderful fantasy.

28:11.006 --> 28:13.634
Here we are
on an empty beach
in paradise.

28:13.709 --> 28:15.802
Two strangers on horseback.

28:16.478 --> 28:18.002
If this were
the movie version,

28:18.080 --> 28:20.947
I'd break into
a fast gallop
through the surf.

28:21.016 --> 28:23.075
Oh, yeah?
And then what?

28:23.385 --> 28:24.943
You'd chase me,

28:25.020 --> 28:27.318
all in slow motion,
of course.
Of course.

28:27.389 --> 28:29.152
With incredibly
romantic music.

28:29.225 --> 28:30.453
Naturally.

28:30.526 --> 28:33.518
And then, my horse
throws me into the surf,

28:34.663 --> 28:36.324
and you leap off.

28:36.832 --> 28:37.890
Leap?

28:40.469 --> 28:41.868
And we kiss.

28:46.041 --> 28:49.533
Of course, we could just
skip the preliminaries
and get to what matters.

29:15.638 --> 29:18.072
Where's the sunset
when I need it?

29:37.393 --> 29:38.382
Hi, Rick.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.121
Ah, good.
I was just calling you.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.062
This here,
is a repair bill
for my sweater.

29:43.132 --> 29:45.327
And you're lucky that
the Tiny Tailor can repair it

29:45.401 --> 29:46.959
or you'd be buying me
a new sweater.

29:47.569 --> 29:49.901
Whatever you say.
What are you doing here?

29:50.506 --> 29:51.871
My adding machine broke.

29:51.941 --> 29:53.203
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

29:53.275 --> 29:55.243
You mean there's
no argument, nothing?

29:55.311 --> 29:57.108
What's to argue?
You helped me out,

29:57.179 --> 29:58.806
you damaged your sweater
in the process.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.213
The least I can do
is pay to repair it.

30:03.986 --> 30:05.510
Are you all right?

30:05.587 --> 30:07.885
I'm fine.
The computer is
working again,

30:07.957 --> 30:10.517
the jewelry competition
is going to be held
at the estate,

30:10.592 --> 30:12.753
and Krista is
having dinner
with me tonight.

30:12.828 --> 30:16.025
That's strange.
Miss Villoroch invited me
to dine with her tonight.

30:16.699 --> 30:17.791
What?

30:18.067 --> 30:20.399
Miss Villoroch invited me
to dinner.

30:20.469 --> 30:23.563
Why would she invite
the both of you to dinner?

34:14.235 --> 34:17.831
Thomas, would you please
explain to these officers
what's going on?

34:18.607 --> 34:20.438
You mean going to jail
isn't part of the game?

34:20.509 --> 34:23.034
Not unless you would
derive some perverse
pleasure from it.

34:23.545 --> 34:26.981
It's okay, guys, really.
She's just here
to check the security.

34:27.049 --> 34:29.347
I thought
you did that this morning?

34:31.485 --> 34:32.543
We were...

34:32.621 --> 34:35.715
We were,
but Miss Villoroch represents
the insurance company,

34:35.791 --> 34:37.952
and she had to approve
the system herself.

34:38.025 --> 34:39.425
Funny way
to test a system.

34:39.494 --> 34:40.620
Not really.

34:40.696 --> 34:42.926
I assure you, the next time
you hear this alarm,

34:42.998 --> 34:45.262
it will be for
a real emergency only.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.891
Next time you wanna
test your system,

34:46.969 --> 34:48.732
why don't you
let us know in advance?

34:48.804 --> 34:51.329
Of course, and if there's
anything we can do...

34:52.040 --> 34:53.701
You can fill out
this report.

35:01.450 --> 35:02.610
I lose.

35:03.285 --> 35:04.547
You got the ring.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.087
I got caught.

35:06.888 --> 35:08.913
What I want to know
is what I missed.

35:08.991 --> 35:12.290
Infra-red security system
on the inside of the safe.

35:12.728 --> 35:15.424
Impossible.
I have special lenses that
would have caught that.

35:15.497 --> 35:18.864
It's passive.
It's activated by
the heat of your hand.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.098
I'm proud of you, Krista.

35:22.170 --> 35:25.105
You're the best daughter
a father could have.

35:25.173 --> 35:26.538
A toast.

35:27.943 --> 35:30.605
To the two greatest
jewel thieves of all time.

35:32.114 --> 35:33.103
Us.

35:45.342 --> 35:46.775
Beautiful,
isn't it?

35:50.614 --> 35:51.945
Beautiful.

35:52.616 --> 35:54.584
I meant the Karachi.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.848
Well, I don't know.

35:57.254 --> 35:59.552
It's a little much
for my taste.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.015
It's perfect.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.023
Doc used to
tell me bedtime stories
about this stone,

36:06.096 --> 36:09.725
how it was taken in ransom
for a Persian emperor
by Alexander the Great.

36:10.401 --> 36:13.199
Then stolen years later,
during the Crusades,

36:13.270 --> 36:15.602
as a gift for
the throne of England.

36:15.673 --> 36:19.507
Only it never
made it to the court
of Richard the Lion-Hearted.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.102
Legend says that
a thousand men were executed

36:22.179 --> 36:23.771
trying to find
its whereabouts.

36:24.915 --> 36:26.815
Charming bedtime stories.

36:26.884 --> 36:29.580
How did the present owner
get his hands on it?

36:30.321 --> 36:32.312
No one knows for certain.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.684
It was in Hitler's collection
during the Second World War

36:35.759 --> 36:37.522
and ended up
in South America.

36:37.595 --> 36:41.053
Rumor has it
that Lenor Vandercliff
bought it from Martin Bormann

36:42.333 --> 36:43.766
in the late '50s.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.962
The woman you shared
your champagne with
at the opening dinner?

36:49.974 --> 36:51.134
Right.

36:51.609 --> 36:52.667
Well,

36:53.577 --> 36:55.568
maybe she won't win.

36:55.646 --> 36:57.773
I don't hold grudges,
Thomas.

36:58.516 --> 37:01.110
There are better ways
to expend one's time
and energy.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.480
What's this one?
- This is out of
the Bulgari Collection.

37:04.555 --> 37:07.319
You can see the consistency
of the style and the use
of the multicolored...

37:07.391 --> 37:09.291
This is damned awkward.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.425
Miss Villoroch,
I'm afraid Lenor Vandercliff

37:11.495 --> 37:13.656
has threatened
to pull her entry
from the competition

37:13.731 --> 37:17.258
if I do not ask you
to leave the premises.

37:17.701 --> 37:19.532
No, she's not leaving.

37:19.603 --> 37:20.763
It's all right,
I'll go.

37:20.838 --> 37:21.827
No.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.464
I consider it
in very poor taste.

37:23.541 --> 37:25.441
As far as I'm concerned,
you're welcome to stay,

37:25.509 --> 37:27.875
regardless of
the consequences.

37:27.945 --> 37:29.674
No. It's all right,
really.

37:30.881 --> 37:33.406
We wouldn't want the Karachi
pulled from the competition.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.975
This competition has
been a great burden,
and I won't rest

37:36.053 --> 37:38.180
until the final photographs
are taken tomorrow

37:38.255 --> 37:40.655
and the jewels are returned
to their owners.

37:40.724 --> 37:42.191
Just one more night.

37:42.259 --> 37:45.387
Again, Miss Villoroch,
my humble apologies.

37:45.563 --> 37:46.860
No need.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.489
I'll see you
to the door.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.177
I think I'll go back
in there

38:04.248 --> 38:07.274
and throw champagne
in her face, and Higgins'.

38:07.985 --> 38:11.421
No, it's just a waste of...
A waste of good champagne.

38:12.022 --> 38:13.455
Or we could steal
the Karachi.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.023
If we're gonna
steal the Karachi,

38:19.096 --> 38:21.121
why not take
the entire collection?

38:24.435 --> 38:26.528
We could plan a strategy
over dinner.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.902
What strategy?
You've already done it twice.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.407
The third time
would require something new.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.435
I'll tell you
all about it at dinner.

38:44.088 --> 38:45.487
Thank you.

38:54.798 --> 38:57.096
Shall we make it
Ma Mer at 9:00?

38:59.703 --> 39:00.761
9:00.

39:13.517 --> 39:17.283
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored guests,
and participants

39:17.354 --> 39:20.755
in the 5th Annual
Robin Masters' International
Design Competition.

39:21.058 --> 39:24.994
This afternoon, we are honored
to have 10 of the world's
top jewelry designers

39:25.062 --> 39:27.496
grace us with
their magnificent creations.

39:28.165 --> 39:31.362
Jewelry design is an art form
as old as time itself.

39:31.435 --> 39:32.993
Man has always
adorned himself,

39:33.070 --> 39:34.537
in one form or another,

39:34.605 --> 39:37.369
with pieces of the beauty
that surrounds him.

39:37.441 --> 39:41.878
These talented men and women
have combined the treasures
of the earth and the sea

39:42.246 --> 39:46.910
with their own creative
visions, and brought them here
to share with us today.

39:47.151 --> 39:51.315
Certainly, each of
these superb designs
deserves an award,

39:51.855 --> 39:54.221
but there is only one to win.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.819
Thus, I offer
my heartfelt appreciation,

39:56.894 --> 39:59.021
and hope for
their continued success.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.120
Now, I won't keep you
in anguish any longer,

40:01.198 --> 40:02.495
because I know
what you really want

40:02.566 --> 40:04.693
is to get this over with
and get on with the banquet.

40:07.771 --> 40:12.105
It gives me great pleasure
to announce the winner
of this year's competition.

40:14.044 --> 40:16.376
For the fourth
consecutive year,

40:16.447 --> 40:19.575
Lenor Vandercliff,
for her masterpiece creation,

40:19.950 --> 40:21.679
the Karachi Necklace.

40:29.426 --> 40:30.723
Thank you.

40:30.794 --> 40:34.423
I am, quite literally,
speechless.

40:34.898 --> 40:38.925
Winning the Robin Masters'
Competition is by far
the most gratifying reward...

40:39.002 --> 40:42.438
<i>I couldn't help but</i>
<i>wonder if Lenor Vandercliff</i>
<i>would keep designing jewelry</i>

40:42.506 --> 40:46.670
<i>if there were</i>
<i>no competition to enter,</i>
<i>no games to keep her going.</i>

40:47.878 --> 40:50.005
<i>And then I thought</i>
<i>about Krista.</i>

40:50.080 --> 40:54.517
<i>She was asking me to trust</i>
<i>that she would walk away</i>
<i>from $170 million,</i>

40:54.985 --> 40:57.545
<i>that she would intentionally</i>
<i>throw the game.</i>

40:58.388 --> 41:01.050
<i>And I suddenly realized,</i>
<i>I really wanted</i>
<i>to believe that.</i>

41:01.592 --> 41:03.787
We already know
we can do it, Doc.

41:03.861 --> 41:05.419
It doesn't mean we have to.

41:07.798 --> 41:08.992
Krista,

41:09.733 --> 41:13.066
are you falling in love
with a man you only met
two days ago?

41:13.137 --> 41:16.163
Of course not.
And don't change the subject.

41:16.507 --> 41:19.408
The subject is
$170 million worth
of jewelry.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.443
It's the theft
of a lifetime.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.173
You just can't ask me
to throw it away.

41:23.247 --> 41:24.305
It's too dangerous.

41:24.381 --> 41:26.372
There's no thrill
if there's no danger.

41:26.450 --> 41:29.044
I don't want you to spend
the rest of your life
in prison.

41:29.119 --> 41:30.677
There are not
that many more years left.

41:30.754 --> 41:31.948
I know.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.515
That's why I don't want
to waste them.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.957
You don't want
to waste them?

41:38.028 --> 41:39.086
Yes,

41:40.130 --> 41:42.257
like all the years
you spent tripping
around the world,

41:42.332 --> 41:44.562
whilst I was in
one boarding school
or another.

41:44.635 --> 41:47.433
All the Christmases alone
because that was
your best season.

41:47.504 --> 41:51.235
God, Doc, why do you
think I asked you to
teach me everything?

41:51.308 --> 41:54.175
I just wanted some way
we could be together.

41:57.781 --> 41:59.009
Krista,

42:00.884 --> 42:02.715
I love you,

42:04.021 --> 42:05.579
but you can't ask me
to turn my back

42:05.656 --> 42:08.853
on the most famous
jewelry theft
in all of history.

42:11.094 --> 42:15.087
I've breached that estate
twice in the past two days.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.690
We've already proved
we can do it.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.759
It's not the same thing.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.901
What you did
was an exercise.

42:22.973 --> 42:25.134
There's a difference
when it's real.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.200
There's that moment
in the heart of a theft

42:27.277 --> 42:30.713
when your blood turns to ice
and the sweat blinds you,

42:31.081 --> 42:33.379
and if you can't
shut off the fear,
you just might miss

42:33.450 --> 42:35.816
that one something
that'll get you caught.

42:36.854 --> 42:38.822
Where the hell
is the thrill?

42:38.889 --> 42:40.754
Just on the other side.

42:40.824 --> 42:43.418
The most incredible high
in the world.

42:43.660 --> 42:45.321
Share it with me, Krista.

42:45.395 --> 42:47.955
It's like nothing
you'll ever experience.
Nothing!

42:51.168 --> 42:54.626
<i>I decided to believe</i>
<i>in my emotions and show up.</i>

42:54.872 --> 42:58.035
<i>Maybe this was one game</i>
<i>that could end in a draw.</i>

43:19.696 --> 43:21.493
You're not changing
anything, are you?

43:21.565 --> 43:23.055
No, not tonight.

43:23.133 --> 43:25.931
If something's not right,
it stays as is.

43:26.136 --> 43:30.129
I appreciate your vigilance
regarding this whole
sordid incident.

43:31.041 --> 43:33.271
I need all the help
I can get.

43:33.610 --> 43:37.774
I've even decided to place
the lads inside the den
as a precautionary measure.

43:37.848 --> 43:39.782
Dogs on duty, huh, guys?

43:39.850 --> 43:43.411
Yes. So, I want to bypass
the carpet sensors in there.

43:44.154 --> 43:45.451
Bypass?

44:13.951 --> 44:16.351
The sensors don't
show anything.

44:16.553 --> 44:18.316
It's probably those
hang-glider people

44:18.388 --> 44:20.754
celebrating the coming
of the Kona winds.

45:01.531 --> 45:02.862
Would you care to order,
Magnum?

45:02.933 --> 45:05.265
It doesn't look like
your friend's gonna
show up.

45:05.335 --> 45:08.065
Oh, I'll wait
a little longer. Thanks.

45:08.138 --> 45:10.265
I will have
another beer though, Larry.

45:18.482 --> 45:20.882
You were wonderful,
Krista, wonderful!

45:20.951 --> 45:22.816
I wish I could have...

45:27.357 --> 45:29.416
The drawers are all empty!

45:32.863 --> 45:34.421
What the hell?

45:52.716 --> 45:56.379
Excuse me, Magnum,
but a lady asked me
to give this to you.

46:00.524 --> 46:03.254
She said to say thanks.
She owes you one.

46:05.929 --> 46:07.021
Yeah.

46:10.133 --> 46:14.627
I'll tell you what, Larry,
I'll have an 18-ounce
New York charred rare

46:14.704 --> 46:17.798
with some baked potato skins
and some extra parsley.

46:17.874 --> 46:20.001
And I think I'll have
a scotch this time.
