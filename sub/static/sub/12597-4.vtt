of wisconsin right here

On <i> nightmares with nimbus.</i>
(screams)

00:22.490 --> 00:24.423

Uh, no can do, johnny,

On account of

00:32.883 --> 00:35.501
Wow. Well, that's good because
here at senior scare school,

00:35.503 --> 00:37.403
The seniors scare
the middle schoolers

00:37.405 --> 00:39.238
And not vice versa.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.573
Yeah. And i have
been waiting three years

00:41.575 --> 00:43.342
To scare
these middle schoolers.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.510
And i'm talking
to you, parker.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.512
-Boo!
-(yelps)

00:46.514 --> 00:48.414
Scared me.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.382
Johnny:
<i>Even tinkled a bit.</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:52.584
You can't scare
dr. P, maddie!

00:52.586 --> 00:54.486
He fears no one!

00:54.488 --> 00:56.522
Johnny nimbus:
<i>I mean, 'ol johnny looks great!</i>

00:56.524 --> 00:59.291
Uh, reggie,
maddie's no joke.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.559
When i was little,
she scared me

01:00.561 --> 01:03.295
Into giving her all
of my halloween candy.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.497
Ooh, that's cold.
How'd she do that?

01:05.499 --> 01:07.499
Well, she said if i didn't,
then i'm be haunted

01:07.501 --> 01:11.570
By a scottish demon
called the goomery goo.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.574
That's a dumb thing
to be afraid of.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.443
You're afraid
of balloon animals!

01:17.445 --> 01:19.311
-Isn't everybody?
-No!

01:19.313 --> 01:20.512
Only you!

01:21.549 --> 01:23.382
So our school
has put together

01:23.384 --> 01:25.551
The scariest
senior scare school ever.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.554
Well, the scariest thing
i see is a lack of options

01:28.556 --> 01:30.289
At the snack table!
Oof!

01:30.291 --> 01:33.258
(screams)
the celery has got me!

01:33.260 --> 01:36.462
Oh, this is how
the gypsy said it would end.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.566
Okay, willow.
You can let him go.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.267
Willow?

Seniors rule!

01:46.040 --> 01:47.506

Show's over.

please stop laughing.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.679
Oh, sorry, it's just
johnny nimbus is so dumb.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.583
Johnny nimbus is dead.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.352
Both:
What?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.488
Yeah. It's on
the news right now.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.557
He was covering the closing
of a toilet factory,

03:11.559 --> 03:13.559
And a forklift dropped
a port-a-potty on him.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.460
-Oh.
-(groans)

03:17.531 --> 03:19.565
Oh, poor johnny.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.667
Death by doodie.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.469
Oh, look, look.
They're running a tribute

03:24.471 --> 03:26.505
Of nimbus highlights.

03:26.507 --> 03:30.108
-<i> (piano music plays)</i>

get the weather right?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.160
(sniffles)

03:48.162 --> 03:49.628
All:
Not once.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.566
(party music plays)

03:55.636 --> 04:00.539
All right, here is
your autograph, mr. Zombie.

04:00.541 --> 04:04.543
I made it out
to (grunts, growls)
just like you asked.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.448
Oh, please watch <i> voltage</i> !

04:09.450 --> 04:11.550
To promote my new
tv show, <i> voltage,</i>

04:11.552 --> 04:13.085
I got to go
to new york city

04:13.087 --> 04:15.420
To be on jimmy fallon.
(squeals)

04:15.422 --> 04:17.456
I killed it
in my lip-sync battle.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.493
I begged and i whined
until liv agreed

04:21.495 --> 04:23.161
To take me with her
to new york.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.598
I really wanted to go
to the central park spooktacular

04:26.600 --> 04:30.168
And debut my greatest
halloween costume ever.

04:34.174 --> 04:38.543
See, it's me as a cat
wearing a joey t-shirt.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.679
It's ironic,
it's awesome,

04:40.681 --> 04:43.548
And i'm never
taking it off.

04:43.550 --> 04:47.452
(sing songy)
doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo...

04:47.454 --> 04:50.555
I hope the spooktacular
scares me to death nine times.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.225
See, i'm a cat,
so i have nine lives.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.559
Right. Yeah.
Yeah, i get it.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.162
Why don't you go
get your haunted house on?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.164
Mostly because
your freakishly large

04:59.166 --> 05:01.166
Cat eyes are
creeping me out.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.234
If they're creeping you out,

05:02.236 --> 05:04.536
You can always
just look at joey.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.639
This is the best costume ever!
See ya.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.474
(sing songy)
doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo...

05:12.646 --> 05:14.713
(chuckles)
why mr. Wolf...

05:14.715 --> 05:16.481
What big ears you have.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.683
(chuckles)

05:17.685 --> 05:20.552
All the better to hear
you with my-- liv!

05:21.689 --> 05:23.555
Holden!

05:23.557 --> 05:25.691
(laughs nervously)
hi!

05:27.227 --> 05:29.161
You're in new york city...
(laughs nervously)

05:29.163 --> 05:31.697
And you're dressed
as the big bad wolf.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.266
And you're in new york city...

05:34.268 --> 05:36.501
Dressed as
little red riding hood.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.503
(laughs nervously)

05:38.505 --> 05:41.506
Look at us!
We're living a fairy tale!

05:41.508 --> 05:43.358
(both laugh nervously)

05:43.359 --> 05:45.209
So what are the odds
that the guy that i like,

05:45.212 --> 05:47.579
But have been avoiding
because he dated my friend andie

05:47.581 --> 05:50.515
Would show up in new york
on halloween at the same event

05:50.517 --> 05:52.250
Wearing a costume
from the same fairy tale as me?

05:52.252 --> 05:55.620
(laughs nervously)
apparently 100%.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.123
Wow. Um, so-- so what...

05:58.125 --> 05:59.591
Brings you to new york?

05:59.593 --> 06:02.260
I'm heading
to grandmother's house.

06:02.262 --> 06:05.263
-(laughs)
-no, literally.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.633
My grandmother lives
on 86th and amsterdam.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.203
Oh...

06:11.205 --> 06:12.237
Cool!

06:12.239 --> 06:14.172
Uh, well...

06:14.174 --> 06:15.307
Great to see you.

06:15.309 --> 06:17.309
(laughs nervously)

06:19.646 --> 06:22.714
Actually, it's really
kind of awkward to see you.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.183
Um... The last time
that we were together,

06:25.185 --> 06:27.652
You said some things,
you know, sort of like...

06:27.654 --> 06:29.321
"hey, liv!"
and like, you know,

06:29.323 --> 06:31.256
"what's up, liv?" and...

06:31.258 --> 06:34.159
"i'll wait for you
as long as it takes, liv."
you know...

06:34.161 --> 06:36.595
Yeah... About that.

06:36.597 --> 06:40.165
Um... I didn't mean to make
things awkward between us.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.200
Can we just
hang out as friends?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.603
Huh.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.304
Yeah.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.206
I guess maybe
we could do that.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.276
I mean, we were friends
before all of this, right?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.961
-Right. Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:52.962 --> 06:54.645
-Oh, yeah.
So right. (scoffs)
-yeah.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.316
Back-to-being-friends hug?

06:58.318 --> 07:00.318
-Yeah.
-Yay!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.788
No.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.257
-Back-to-being-
friends handshake.
-Yeah, being-friends handshake.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.161
Now, what is going on, pete?

07:09.163 --> 07:11.196
We've had, like,
three trick-or-treaters.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.166
Well, we're handing
out tongue scrapers.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.700
We're that house.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.269
(doorbell)

07:17.271 --> 07:19.237
Oh, here's one!

07:21.308 --> 07:23.341
-Trick or treat!
-Oh!

07:23.343 --> 07:25.310
Well, hello, evan.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.345
Aren't you just
the cutest little hot dog?

07:27.347 --> 07:29.247
Actually, i'm a veggie dog,

07:29.249 --> 07:30.715
The healthy alternative.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.719
Well, why aren't you
at senior scare school

07:34.721 --> 07:36.188
With parker and the others?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.190
Scaring people on purpose?

07:38.192 --> 07:41.193
That isn't my cup
of herbal tea.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.161
Well, i'm glad you came.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.696
We haven't had
many trick-or-treaters.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.331
That's probably because

07:46.333 --> 07:48.366
Your house has a terrible
rating on the treat beat.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.735
What's the treat beat?

07:50.737 --> 07:52.737
It's an app that rates
all the neighborhood houses

07:52.739 --> 07:54.372
Based on the treats
they give out.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.775
-(gasps)
-let me see that.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.412
You've got a two
smashed pumpkins rating.

08:00.414 --> 08:03.682
And a lot of rude comments that
i wouldn't recommend reading.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.420
-Told you, karen.
Everyone hates us.
-Eh...

08:10.190 --> 08:12.357
Anyhoodle,
trick or healthy treat!

08:14.328 --> 08:17.262
-(giggles)
-oral hygiene device?

08:17.264 --> 08:20.332
Wow, mrs. Rooney,
even i think this is lame.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.204
Well, i just don't want
to be promoting tooth decay!

08:26.206 --> 08:27.305
And i don't want
to be the house

08:27.307 --> 08:29.708
With the worst rating
on treat beat!

08:29.710 --> 08:31.710
Might i suggest
a happy medium?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.713
Something healthy
trick-or-treaters
will love, like...

08:34.715 --> 08:36.381
Prune pops.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.682
(gasps)

08:41.455 --> 08:43.455
Senior scare school is ours.

08:43.457 --> 08:47.392
Must. Get. Snacks.

08:49.263 --> 08:52.464
Oh, no! I hope a hand
doesn't pop out and grab me.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.466
-(screams)
-(squeaks)

08:54.468 --> 08:56.401
Balloon animal!

08:57.471 --> 09:00.405
-(squeaks)
-(screams)

09:00.407 --> 09:02.440
-Reggie, be cool! Be cool!
-(bagpipe music plays)

09:02.442 --> 09:04.342
The goomery goo!

09:04.344 --> 09:06.244
(both scream)

09:09.716 --> 09:12.250
We just goomery-gotcha!

09:12.252 --> 09:14.486
(laughs)
yes!

09:14.488 --> 09:17.188
Say it, middle schooler.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.357
Fine.
I was scared.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.493
Well done,
old-timey pilot lady.

09:21.495 --> 09:24.462
(scoffs)
i'm amelia earhart.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.265
'cause she was
an inspiring female role model.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.402
No. 'cause they never found
her body, and that's scary.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.337
(laughs)

09:32.339 --> 09:34.406
How did you know
i was terrified
of balloon animals?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.174
Uh, isn't everyone?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.375
See, dr. P?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.177
-(squeaks)
-(screams)

09:39.179 --> 09:40.245
(screams mockingly)

09:42.516 --> 09:44.749
-(door rattles)
-it's locked.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.218
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.223
(rattles)

09:52.225 --> 09:53.358
That's really weird.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
This door is,
like, never locked.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.229
(overlapping gasps)

09:58.231 --> 10:00.298
All right, you
already scared us.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.333
You can stop.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.468
That isn't us.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.346
-<i> Channel four </i> microphone?
-Willow: (gasps)

10:14.348 --> 10:16.348
That looks like a nimbus mic!

10:16.350 --> 10:19.284
Why is it wrapped
in toilet paper?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.286
And why do i feel
a sudden chill?

10:21.288 --> 10:24.356
All right, you don't think
the ghost of johnny nimbus

10:24.358 --> 10:25.490
Is haunting us, do you?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.292
(scoffs)

10:27.294 --> 10:29.260
Okay, stop.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.196
There's gotta be
a logical explanation.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.331
(rumbling)

10:35.268 --> 10:36.368
(gasps)

10:42.576 --> 10:45.377
I have a logical
explanation for this.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.379
Johnny nimbus is haunting us!

10:47.381 --> 10:48.546
(screams)

10:55.389 --> 10:58.223
Johnny nimbus is haunting us.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.425
Johnny nimbus is haunting us!

11:00.427 --> 11:02.427
Okay, so there is no way

11:02.429 --> 11:06.164
That we are being haunted
by johnny nimbus.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.500
-Runaway toilet paper
is a message!
-Yeah!

11:08.502 --> 11:11.236
-He's coming to wipe us out!
-(sobs)

11:12.539 --> 11:15.206
Maddie, when you embarrassed
him on tv,

11:15.208 --> 11:18.276
Johnny did say he was
gonna get even with you.

11:19.579 --> 11:23.548
-"if it's the last thing
i do... Do... Do."
-(gasps)

11:26.219 --> 11:28.386
Wait, so he's
only after maddie?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.288
Phew. The pressure's off.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.389
Where's the chip dip?

11:33.493 --> 11:35.193
Don't worry, maddie.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.295
I've got a way
we can find out for sure.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.298
I'm not worried.
I never was.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.201
We'll ask johnny
by summoning him from...

11:43.203 --> 11:45.370
Beyond the grave.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.372
-Reggie: (screams)
-(yelps)

11:47.374 --> 11:50.442
What? Willow, they're
out of chip dip.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.416
This line is taking forever.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.519
Well, i could huff and puff
and blow this house down.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.293
(gasps)
cyd!

12:08.294 --> 12:10.194
Shelby:
Cyd, are you seeing
what i'm seeing?

12:10.197 --> 12:12.331
I'm a bunny, shelby.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.466
I eat tons of carrots,
so my eyesight's impeccable.

12:14.468 --> 12:18.403
-No.
-It's liv rooney from <i> voltage</i> .

12:18.405 --> 12:20.505
Liv rooney's here? Where?

12:20.507 --> 12:23.441
The gossip blogs will
pay a ton of money
for a shot of her.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.443
She's over there.
Liv rooney!

12:25.445 --> 12:28.279
I'm your biggest fan!
You do it all, girl!

12:28.281 --> 12:29.514
Thank you.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.283
-(growls)
-(gasps)

12:32.285 --> 12:35.320
-(camera snaps)
-oh, perfect shot!

12:35.322 --> 12:37.555
Bingo and cha-chingo!

12:40.227 --> 12:41.593
That shot is gonna be so great.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.561
It's so romantic.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.397
Oh, no. We're--
we're not a couple.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.501
Really? Because it totally
looked like you were
about to kiss.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.369
Yeah. Super couple-y.

12:51.371 --> 12:55.440
Oh, no! But we're...
We're so friend-y.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.310
Liv, if he publishes that photo,
andie could see it.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.379
And think that we're
sneaking behind her back

13:01.381 --> 13:03.448
To have a super secret
nyc smoochfest!

13:03.450 --> 13:04.582
He's gotta delete that photo.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.252
Um... Sorry.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.386
Excuse me!

13:08.388 --> 13:10.221
Hi, excuse me.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.523
Hi, mr. Photographer man.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.525
Um, is there any way
that you could

13:13.527 --> 13:15.260
Delete that photo
that you just took?

13:15.262 --> 13:16.561
Just because we don't
want anybody to see it.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.596
Whoa. That means
it's worth even more.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.465
Thanks for telling me.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.334
You're all right, liv rooney.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.603
No, that's...

13:25.605 --> 13:28.239
(laughs nervously)

13:28.241 --> 13:30.275
(sighs)

13:30.277 --> 13:32.310
So he's not gonna delete it.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.246
(laughs nervously)

13:34.247 --> 13:36.181
We're gonna have to find
a way to delete it ourselves.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.483
Sounds like trouble.
I'm in.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.521
You're kinda dark
and weird for a fluffy bunny.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.624
She gets me.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.364
Here ya go.
Just like a cake pop.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.500
Except they're healthy!

13:55.502 --> 13:57.268
No chocolate,
no sugar,

13:57.270 --> 14:00.305
And not as sweet,
but just as fun... Prune pops!

14:08.315 --> 14:10.315
Well...

14:11.518 --> 14:14.452
I am so glad you decided
to hang out with us, evan.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.355
Oh, our treat beat score
has to be way up now.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.940
Wrong.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.524
It's dropped all the way
to six smashed pumpkins.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.431
Let's give the kids
what they want!

14:26.433 --> 14:28.399
You know what?
That app lies.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.235
The kids love
those prune pops!

14:30.237 --> 14:31.603
You know what?
They emptied the whole bowl.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.538
-(thumping)
-oh.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.452
Fine.
Give them the candy.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.290
It's like i always
say, mrs. Rooney.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.592
If you can't beat 'em,
silently judge 'em.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.570
Okay, we'll talk to
the ghost of nimbus by playing

15:05.572 --> 15:08.373
"johnny, johnny,
are you there?"

15:08.375 --> 15:11.276
Sorry, i'm already
too busy playing

15:11.278 --> 15:13.344
"parker, parker,
this is dumb."

15:15.448 --> 15:17.382
How does this work?

15:17.384 --> 15:19.350
Okay, we ask
yes or no questions,

15:19.352 --> 15:21.286
And his spirit will
move the pencils--

15:21.288 --> 15:23.254
-From beyond the grave.
-Willow: (gasps)

15:23.256 --> 15:24.422
Here it goes.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.557
Johnny, johnny,
are you there?

15:26.559 --> 15:29.394
Willow:
(gasps)

15:29.396 --> 15:31.429
It said yes!

15:31.431 --> 15:33.531
(whispers)
he's here!

15:36.569 --> 15:37.602
(inhales deeply)

15:37.604 --> 15:39.637
Johnny, johnny,
are you angry?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.408
(gasps)

15:43.410 --> 15:45.543
(whispers)
he's angry!

15:47.314 --> 15:49.480
Okay, please.
You're blowing on it.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.449
He's not!
This is real.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.487
Johnny, johnny,
it's me, willow.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.589
Will joey ever admit
that he loves me?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.491
Will chillow ever happen?

16:00.493 --> 16:02.260
-(thump)
-(screams)

16:02.262 --> 16:03.428
Willow:
(yelps)

16:03.430 --> 16:04.562
What was that?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.464
It was the pencil
moving towards yes!

16:06.466 --> 16:09.267
You bumped it!

16:09.269 --> 16:11.353
Okay, you guys,
can you just knock it off?

16:11.354 --> 16:13.438
-(rumbling)
-i mean, we actually don't
have time for this nonsense.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.273
Let's just figure out
a way to get out of here.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.608
And also, oof,
what is that awful smell?

16:17.610 --> 16:20.545
P-- p-- p--
p-- p-- port-a-potty!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.616
It's the port-a-potty
that squashed nimbus!

16:35.428 --> 16:37.462
All right, is this flash-mob
thing gonna happen?

16:37.464 --> 16:40.531
Yes. So, i have rounded up
some of the <i> voltage </i> fans

16:40.533 --> 16:42.633
Here at the spooktacular
and with their help,

16:42.635 --> 16:45.269
We can distract the photographer
and delete the picture.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.372
And if we fail,
we will accidentally hurt andie

16:47.374 --> 16:49.507
And make an enemy
out of a girl with a blowtorch.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.609
So let's just shoot
for the first one.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.544
-Yeah.
-That's a good idea.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.614
All right!
The music is ready.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.350
I can't believe i'm on
an adventure with liv rooney.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.551
I'm excited too,

17:00.553 --> 17:02.453
But able to
contain my emotions.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.357
Okay... Let's do this.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.326
Dj, drop the beat!

17:08.328 --> 17:11.295
-(click)
-(halloween dance music plays)

17:32.285 --> 17:34.452
We're in a flash-mob
with liv rooney.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.520
Will you take
a pic of us?

17:35.522 --> 17:37.455
Yeah, sure. Why not?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.557
Oh, no.
Use her camera.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.426
Ah.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.330
-(camera snaps)
-got it.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.499
Shelby:
No, i think
i blinked. Do it again.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.600
(beeping)

17:51.371 --> 17:53.337
-(camera snaps)
-definitely got it.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.674
Thank you.
You're the best.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.553
(cheering and applause)

18:11.591 --> 18:14.625
-Celebratory handshake!
-Yes. Okay.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.596
(screaming)

18:18.598 --> 18:20.465
Let's get out of here!

18:20.467 --> 18:22.633
Maddie:
Why won't these doors open?

18:24.571 --> 18:26.571
It's coming!

18:26.573 --> 18:28.439
We gotta get out of here

18:28.441 --> 18:31.342
Before the haunted
port-a-potty gets us!

18:34.481 --> 18:35.680
(rumbling)

18:37.350 --> 18:39.050
It's alive!

18:39.052 --> 18:41.385
Alive!

18:44.357 --> 18:45.656
Here's johnny!

18:45.658 --> 18:47.391
(all screaming)

18:49.596 --> 18:52.463
I told you, maddie,
i'd make you pay

18:52.465 --> 18:54.298
If it were
the last thing i do!

18:54.300 --> 18:56.567
-No! No!
-Now into the port-a-potty!

18:56.569 --> 18:58.536
No! No!

18:58.538 --> 19:00.404
Not the port-a-potty!

19:00.406 --> 19:02.373
I can't! I'm scared!

19:02.375 --> 19:03.608
I'm scared!

19:03.610 --> 19:06.377
-Did you say "scared"?
-Yeah!

19:06.379 --> 19:07.645
Well, you should be...

19:07.647 --> 19:10.214
'cause you're on
<i>nightmares with nimbus!</i>

19:13.653 --> 19:16.554
Hello, stevens point!

19:16.556 --> 19:18.589
Johnny nimbus here
with maddie rooney,

19:18.591 --> 19:21.325
The most fearless
woman in town!

19:21.327 --> 19:25.329
She just got the pants scared
off her live on <i> channel four</i> !

19:25.331 --> 19:28.065
Maddie rooney, you just got...

19:28.067 --> 19:29.600
Nimboozled.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.605
(sobbing)

19:36.576 --> 19:38.476
What's going on?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.412
Parker and i have been
planning to turn

19:41.414 --> 19:43.514
The table of terrors
on you seniors for weeks.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.117
And when you humiliated
poor johnny, you created

19:46.119 --> 19:48.653
The perfect opportunity
for us to spring our trap.

19:48.655 --> 19:52.456
Yep, i faked my death
and together we all

19:52.458 --> 19:54.659
Got sweet, sweet revenge!

19:54.661 --> 19:56.627
And by the way,
poor showing

19:56.629 --> 19:58.462
On my memorial page, people.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.565
I mean,
two condolences and one

20:00.567 --> 20:03.467
"he was no al roker"?
Come on, people!

20:05.538 --> 20:07.538
Wow.
(chuckles)

20:07.540 --> 20:09.473
Well played, little bro.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.376
Middle schoolers win.

20:12.378 --> 20:16.447
Now if you'll excuse us,
reggie and i are taking
a victory lap.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.585
After you, dr. Parkerstein.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.099
Hey, thank you guys again
so much for your help today.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.667
Are you kidding, liv rooney?

20:36.669 --> 20:38.436
This was the greatest night
of our lives.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.504
-(laughs)
-the greatest night
of her life.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.506
I don't get starstruck.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.475
Is that austin moon
dressed as bacon?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.444
Austin moon?

20:46.446 --> 20:48.713
Austin moon, i am
your biggest fan!

20:51.684 --> 20:53.451
It's not really austin moon.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.586
I just wanted to see
her make a fool out of herself.

20:57.557 --> 21:01.192
No, actually, i think
that's really austin moon.

21:01.194 --> 21:02.693
Austin moon?

21:04.464 --> 21:06.430
(laughs)

21:07.433 --> 21:09.600
Hey, tonight was fun...

21:09.602 --> 21:12.470
Hanging out
as just friends, you know?

21:12.472 --> 21:14.572
Yeah.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.607
There's really nothing awkward
about this at all.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.476
(laughs)

21:18.478 --> 21:20.645
Do you maybe want to...

21:20.647 --> 21:23.581
Not awkwardly share
a meal as friends?

21:25.218 --> 21:27.451
Yeah.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.686
Yeah, i'd really like that.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.122
Um, let me just
go get joey.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.657
Totally.
Yeah, take your time.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.159
I'll wait for you.
As long as it takes.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.631
I made that awkward
again, didn't i?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.501
Yes.
(laughs nervously)

21:43.503 --> 21:45.636
I'll see you
at stevens point.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.238
Okay.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.173
Bye.

22:03.222 --> 22:05.656
Give us a good rating
on treat beat!

22:05.658 --> 22:09.160
Take another fistful of candy!

22:09.162 --> 22:11.662
Give us a good rating
on treat beat!

22:11.664 --> 22:13.597
Rooney house rules!

22:13.599 --> 22:17.168
-Tell your friends!
-Better yet, tell treat beat!

22:17.170 --> 22:19.203
Karen:
Okay, bye!

22:20.273 --> 22:22.606
You're up to a three
candy corn rating.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.276
(gasps)
happy holla-ween!

22:27.146 --> 22:29.146
I'm glad i stuck around
to see this,

22:29.148 --> 22:33.250
But i still don't get
what the big deal is with candy.

22:33.252 --> 22:36.654
Hey evan, have you ever
tried a piece of candy?

22:36.656 --> 22:38.089
Never.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.124
I choose willpower
and healthy teeth

22:40.126 --> 22:43.227
That will last a lifetime.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.229
I hear you, evan, honey.
But you know what?

22:45.231 --> 22:47.231
Once a year,
it is okay to indulge

22:47.233 --> 22:49.233
In the sugary joys
of halloween.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.269
-Maybe i'll just try one.
-Pete: (chuckles)

22:52.271 --> 22:54.171
(giggles)

22:59.612 --> 23:00.745
Mmm.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.316
Mmm-- uh-oh.

23:05.318 --> 23:07.318
Oh?

23:07.320 --> 23:09.220
Honey, are you okay?

23:09.222 --> 23:11.188
I feel funny.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.091
-Like i...
-(rumbling)

23:14.093 --> 23:17.595
Might blast off!

23:26.305 --> 23:28.272
I guess i should
call his mother.

23:31.344 --> 23:33.110
Johnny nimbus:
Here's johnny!
