-NEWSMAN: Tonight

00:04.439 --> 00:06.093
the NYPD arrested
Dr. Martin Whitly

00:06.136 --> 00:08.834
in connection
to at least 23 murders.

00:08.878 --> 00:11.402
Get him out of here.

00:14.884 --> 00:17.756
[lock buzzes]

00:17.800 --> 00:19.802
[cell door closes]

00:30.073 --> 00:32.206
Thank you.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.476
You look stunning today.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.086
Thank you.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.219
How are the children?

00:45.262 --> 00:47.177
They're...

00:47.221 --> 00:48.526
We can beat this.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.659
I've retained an attorney--
Everett Sterling.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.357
He reassures me
that with our resources,

00:53.401 --> 00:55.403
no criminal charge
is insurmountable.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.057
-Stop...
-I'm coming back

00:57.100 --> 00:58.797
to you, to our children.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.408
I said, stop.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.155
[sighs]

01:08.198 --> 01:10.157
I thought we had a good life.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.462
We still can.

01:11.506 --> 01:15.162
Mother taught me
that marriage is long, that...

01:15.205 --> 01:17.164
a woman overlooks things,

01:17.207 --> 01:19.688
that she makes sacrifices.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.995
I would have sacrificed
anything for you.

01:23.039 --> 01:26.434
And you did, which is why
we will get through this.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.828
Look at this place.

01:29.872 --> 01:33.310
You are never getting out
of here, Martin.

01:33.354 --> 01:36.313
You are going to be in a cage

01:36.357 --> 01:38.576
for the rest of your life.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.104
After what you did,

01:44.147 --> 01:46.193
I will never come back here.

01:46.236 --> 01:49.326
None of us will.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.676
Do you understand?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.377
[quietly]:
Not ever.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.878
[buzzer sounds]

02:22.881 --> 02:24.883
[buzzer sounding]

02:27.190 --> 02:28.670
[pounding on door]

02:32.064 --> 02:33.327
[buzzer sounds]

02:34.371 --> 02:35.851
[groans, inhales sharply]

02:39.463 --> 02:40.682
[yells]

02:41.813 --> 02:43.815
Malcolm.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.211
[groans]

02:55.784 --> 02:57.525
Be careful, Malcolm.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.005
How many other people died?

03:00.049 --> 03:02.617
And why can't you remember?

03:02.660 --> 03:03.531
[grunts]

03:05.533 --> 03:07.970
He changed the locks.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.713
You changed the locks?!

03:13.236 --> 03:15.369
[sighs]

03:17.240 --> 03:20.200
[phone buzzing]

03:20.243 --> 03:22.071
[scoffs]

03:22.114 --> 03:24.508
Malcolm, in response to your...

03:24.552 --> 03:26.945
security upgrade,
I would like to remind you

03:26.989 --> 03:30.210
that you and that wretched
parakeet are merely tenants

03:30.253 --> 03:32.560
of the building that I own.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.302
Open the door!

03:35.345 --> 03:36.955
[grunts]

03:39.262 --> 03:41.046
[gasping]

03:46.095 --> 03:47.705
Are you all right?!

03:51.970 --> 03:53.276
Well, then, it's about time.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.669
Buzz me in, will you?

03:54.712 --> 03:57.715
[panting]

04:03.808 --> 04:05.201
Hmm.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.812
You'll be needing one, too,
judging by that display.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.292
I'm fine.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.380
[Jessica sighs]

04:10.424 --> 04:11.903
Those restraints
are clearly useless.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.079
-I'll look
into a custom bed frame.
-Mother,

04:14.123 --> 04:16.081
why are you here?

04:16.125 --> 04:18.388
You're seeing your father.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.087
[sighs]

04:22.131 --> 04:23.872
I'm a consultant with the NYPD.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.569
He proved helpful
with my casework.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.746
Oh, so you're a team now?

04:28.790 --> 04:32.097
Father and son, solving crimes.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.360
How sweet for you both.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.665
I have no intention
of returning.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.667
This is exactly what he wants.
This is what

04:36.711 --> 04:39.409
he has always wanted--
a relationship.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.890
To control you,
to infect your mind.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.021
He does not control me.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.458
I just watched you

04:44.501 --> 04:46.634
throw yourself out a window.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.682
[Jessica sighs]

04:51.726 --> 04:54.294
I know you think
these memories are real.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.860
They're not.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.427
So shut them down.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.516
I enjoy books on tape.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.301
Gin also works.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.433
-I need answers.
-[sighs]

05:03.477 --> 05:05.261
And there are only two people
in this world

05:05.305 --> 05:06.523
that can provide them--

05:06.567 --> 05:09.700
a convicted serial killer
and you, Mom.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.789
I have no interest
in revisiting the past.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.052
And for the sake
of your mental health,

05:14.096 --> 05:15.445
neither should you.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.621
My mental health is just fine.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.800
I want new keys by tomorrow,

05:22.844 --> 05:27.457
or I am putting in a Panera.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.809
My mental health is fractured.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.637
It's eroding,

05:33.681 --> 05:35.335
maybe past the point of repair.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.163
It... it's not good.

05:38.207 --> 05:41.036
Your hyperbole remains
as vibrant as it was

05:41.079 --> 05:42.820
at 11 years old.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.301
Which is why
you still agree to shrink me.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.781
[Gabrielle laughs]

05:46.824 --> 05:50.132
I shrink you because you tend
to barge in unannounced.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.569
And because you've made it
very clear that you have

05:52.613 --> 05:54.658
no intentions
of seeing a therapist

05:54.702 --> 05:57.661
more appropriate
to your age group.

05:57.705 --> 06:01.361
Well, they don't have
free lollipops.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.667
Uh-huh.
[chuckles]

06:05.713 --> 06:07.454
Um...

06:07.497 --> 06:09.020
what's your professional opinion

06:09.064 --> 06:10.718
on repressed memory?

06:10.761 --> 06:13.111
Is this about your nightmares?

06:14.417 --> 06:16.114
The girl in the box?

06:18.290 --> 06:20.597
I know why they never found her.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.165
My father?

06:23.208 --> 06:24.471
I think he drugged me.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.211
With chloroform or...

06:26.255 --> 06:27.604
or a similar sedative

06:27.648 --> 06:30.215
for... I don't know how long.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.435
Chloroform?

06:32.479 --> 06:34.219
Is that hyperbole?

06:34.263 --> 06:36.526
I'm not sure.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.962
In trademark fashion,

06:38.006 --> 06:41.009
Martin has chosen
to dance around the truth.

06:43.228 --> 06:45.013
You've been seeing your father?

06:46.101 --> 06:47.624
In order to preserve

06:47.668 --> 06:50.758
any hope
of overcoming your PTSD,

06:50.801 --> 06:55.284
I would recommend that you stay
as far away from Martin Whitly

06:55.327 --> 06:57.504
as humanly possible.

06:57.547 --> 06:58.940
[phone buzzing]

07:03.292 --> 07:05.425
Sorry. I have to go.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.296
-Police business.
-Police?

07:07.339 --> 07:08.645
We haven't even discussed

07:08.689 --> 07:10.995
why you were dismissed
by the FBI.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.780
Root beer.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.043
This day
just keeps getting better.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.440
[door closes]

07:20.483 --> 07:22.616
-[siren chirps]
-[indistinct chatter]

07:28.056 --> 07:29.753
[sighs]

07:36.368 --> 07:39.023
For you, Gil.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.895
And for you.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.639
And for you, a lemon-lime.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.380
Professor George Holton.

07:48.424 --> 07:51.471
Big shot at the university with
a lot of letters after his name.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.429
DANI:
Check out his eyes.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.649
Huh.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.000
In the, uh, early 19th century,

07:59.043 --> 08:02.133
experimental lobotomies produced
a similar side effect.

08:02.177 --> 08:05.354
Uh, well, it indicates damage
to the optic nerve.

08:05.397 --> 08:08.879
There may be damage to the brain
as well. Uh, Mr. Bright,

08:08.923 --> 08:10.577
-good morning.
-Cherry?

08:10.620 --> 08:12.274
It's my favorite.

08:12.317 --> 08:16.147
I'm sorry. I didn't realize that
we were exchanging small gifts.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.020
I'm unprepared.
I could go grab something.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.717
Cause of death?

08:20.761 --> 08:22.066
I'm still working on it.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.981
The only presenting wounds
are minor abrasions

08:24.025 --> 08:25.113
on his wrists and ankles.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.681
Indicating he was bound
during the act.

08:27.724 --> 08:30.553
That, plus the lethal
internal injury, means

08:30.597 --> 08:32.512
that what the killer did
took time.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.165
Another location,
someplace secure,

08:34.209 --> 08:35.993
then he or she dumped
the victim here.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.213
GIL:
Detectives, we've got something.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.825
Let's find out why.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.653
AINSLEY [on TV]:
We're in Riverside Park

08:43.697 --> 08:45.481
above 123rd Street,

08:45.525 --> 08:47.048
where, at 7:00 this morning,

08:47.091 --> 08:49.180
police found the body
of Dr. George Holton.

08:49.224 --> 08:52.357
At this time
the NYPD refuses to comment

08:52.401 --> 08:55.099
on any possible suspects,
but we will remain on scene

08:55.143 --> 08:57.362
pending further information
on the case.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.016
GIL:
"Dear Policemen,

08:59.060 --> 09:01.149
"it turned black when they came.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.585
"They said truth.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.413
"Do wildflowers grow there?

09:04.456 --> 09:05.762
"I saw them.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.764
"Tell them I saw them.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.723
Tell them it's all black now."

09:11.855 --> 09:14.379
Glad he cleared all that up.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.772
Well, look at the...

09:15.816 --> 09:19.036
alternate slant
in the writing, the scattered

09:19.080 --> 09:21.648
embellishments,
the lack of consistency.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.780
Nothing here makes any sense.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.216
Well, to him it does.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.828
We're looking
at a serious mental illness.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.525
Could be one of Holton's
former patients.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.918
Possibly.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.181
But this points to a pure,

09:33.224 --> 09:36.445
perhaps progressive,
psychotic break.

09:36.488 --> 09:41.058
Guided by delusions
or... hallucinations.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.800
We may be after
a visionary killer.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.715
They often convince themselves

09:45.759 --> 09:48.239
they're acting on behalf
of a higher power

09:48.283 --> 09:50.285
or a dissociative voice.

09:50.328 --> 09:53.810
God... or the devil.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.247
Well, Bright was right.

09:56.291 --> 09:59.076
This is more than damage
to the optic nerve.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.514
This incision goes
around his entire head.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.516
Most likely a cranial saw,
quarter inch in depth.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.608
The killer cut clean through
this man's skull.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.436
[Dani clears throat]

10:11.480 --> 10:12.612
You don't see that every day.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.831
Took the whole brain.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.572
What the hell does that mean?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.706
I have absolutely no idea.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.104
The victim's brain
was surgically removed.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.845
You're looking
for someone with at least

10:28.889 --> 10:30.499
a basic understanding
of cranial anatomy.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.457
[chuckles]

10:32.501 --> 10:33.937
This is delicious.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.766
JT:
So, cause of death is...

10:36.810 --> 10:38.463
no brain?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.727
Oh, mercifully for him, no.

10:40.770 --> 10:41.728
That's not how he killed him.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.338
Sudden cardiac arrest.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.644
He died of a heart attack?

10:44.687 --> 10:45.993
A heart attack is a result

10:46.036 --> 10:47.995
of a coronary artery blockage.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.127
Our victim's heart was healthy,

10:50.171 --> 10:52.608
even exceptionally low-risk
for his age.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.436
Something else caused his heart
to stop.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.960
His fists were clenched.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.614
Tight enough

10:58.658 --> 11:01.138
and long enough that his fingernails cut into his palms.

11:01.182 --> 11:04.315
Almost like George Holton
was scared to death.

11:04.359 --> 11:07.405
[chuckles softly]
It's fascinating

11:07.449 --> 11:09.190
how it becomes, um...

11:09.233 --> 11:11.496
It's elegant, really,
the evolution

11:11.540 --> 11:12.889
of your hypothesis,
because it starts

11:12.933 --> 11:13.890
-with something...
-Edrisa.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.023
Eh, welcome to the team.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.068
Why go through the trouble

11:18.112 --> 11:19.983
of removing the brain
postmortem?

11:20.027 --> 11:21.985
To him, taking the brain

11:22.029 --> 11:25.423
meets some deep
psychological need.

11:25.467 --> 11:28.644
I just have to find out
what that need is.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.993
DANI:
Holton's a widower.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.691
His neighbor saw him go out
on Saturday night

11:31.734 --> 11:33.823
around 9:00 p.m.
and then never again.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.259
He was on sabbatical,

11:35.303 --> 11:36.913
but his psych lab is
still running at the university

11:36.957 --> 11:39.350
under his research partners...

11:39.394 --> 11:42.702
-and department head
Dr. Elaine Brown.
-Elaine Brown?

11:43.615 --> 11:46.444
-She's a legend.
-Okay.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.708
I studied her research.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.188
-At Quantico.
-WOMAN: Mr. Bright.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.060
I've got your doctor
on the phone.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.237
Uh, right.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.849
Oh, my, uh, dentist.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.069
Bad gums.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.818
I'm tiring
of these phone privileges.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.646
MARTIN:
Did he take the brain?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.648
-[TV playing softly]
-I saw you on television.

12:16.692 --> 12:19.042
You and your sister. Aw.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.131
I mean, local news
remains amateurish,

12:21.175 --> 12:23.220
but I think she has real chops.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.221
Don't you?

12:24.265 --> 12:25.570
Could you mute that, please?

12:25.614 --> 12:27.181
I'm on with my son.

12:29.923 --> 12:33.970
Now, tell me
about Mr. Holton's brain.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.929
That's police business.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.974
Oh, even a layman
could get there.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.281
An incision along
the circumference of the skull?

12:40.324 --> 12:44.241
A skull belonging
to Dr. Elaine Brown's colleague?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.200
You think he's trying
to send a message.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.769
Are you asking my advice?

12:49.812 --> 12:51.248
No.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.774
Uh, you remember our examination
of Dr. Brown's theories.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.601
-I do.
-The brain

12:56.645 --> 12:59.039
is the arbiter
of the human fear response.

12:59.082 --> 13:02.694
Fear can be both motivating
and debilitating.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.045
I'm guessing in the case
of our killer, it's the latter.

13:05.088 --> 13:08.091
[scoffs]
This is not ourcase.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.398
When both my children
take an interest in something,

13:10.441 --> 13:12.661
it's only natural
to want to participate.

13:12.704 --> 13:17.013
Please tell your sister her
diction is-- mmm-- impeccable.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.537
Chapin paid for itself.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.539
Goodbye, Dr. Whitly.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.454
Ah, uh, one more thing.

13:23.498 --> 13:27.458
This case may prove difficult
for you, Malcolm.

13:27.502 --> 13:32.115
Well, fear has always been
your particular stumbling block.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.814
I catch killers for a living.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.817
Still... your nightmares.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.645
That tremor.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.692
You've always been good
at repressing fear,

13:43.735 --> 13:46.173
pretending it's not there.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.611
But it is.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.919
Because of you.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.181
[sighs]

13:54.224 --> 13:56.139
Here we go again
with the blame game.

13:56.183 --> 13:59.273
Uh, why don't you swing by.

13:59.316 --> 14:03.320
You know, you seemed troubled
at our last visit.

14:03.364 --> 14:06.846
So many unanswered questions.

14:06.889 --> 14:10.632
I have no intention
of returning.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.156
Very well.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.551
But do tell Elaine
that her work helped

14:16.594 --> 14:18.596
inspire me to, uh...

14:20.468 --> 14:23.427
...resist convention.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.349
[exhales]

14:42.533 --> 14:43.708
We're both devastated.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.189
It's a tremendous loss
for the community.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.365
Do you know of anyone

14:48.409 --> 14:50.628
who would have wanted to harm
Professor Holton?

14:50.672 --> 14:52.717
Participant number three
is distracted.

14:52.761 --> 14:53.980
Swap out her protocol.

14:54.023 --> 14:57.200
Detective, I have built a career

14:57.244 --> 14:58.898
examining the human mind.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.377
If I observed someone

15:00.421 --> 15:02.945
who was psychologically capable
of that level of sadism,

15:02.989 --> 15:04.904
he would already be
in your custody.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.906
I'm Dr. Elaine Brown.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.865
-Detective Powell.
-Malcolm Bright,
consulting profiler.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.390
-Is that my book?
-Uh, yes. I'm also a huge fan.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.696
Dr. Brown,

15:14.739 --> 15:16.263
we'll need Professor Holton's
class rosters,

15:16.306 --> 15:18.221
-access to his files.
-Of course.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.657
Would you mind signing this?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.834
She doesn't have a pen.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.924
Uh, do you have a pen?

15:24.967 --> 15:26.708
Have there been
any recent incidents

15:26.751 --> 15:28.492
within the department?

15:28.536 --> 15:30.059
Any firings?

15:30.103 --> 15:32.018
-On-campus dramas?
-ELAINE: No, none.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.237
Alice Downey.

15:35.195 --> 15:38.024
She was a graduate student.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.851
She committed suicide
three months ago.

15:39.895 --> 15:43.029
George's sabbatical was really
a mental health leave.

15:43.072 --> 15:46.162
He-he blamed himself.

15:46.206 --> 15:50.079
Did Dr. Holton and Alice
have a relationship?

15:50.123 --> 15:53.561
Not at all, and I resent
the salacious implication.

15:53.604 --> 15:54.910
Alice was troubled.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.433
She succumbed to the pressures

15:56.477 --> 15:58.305
-of doctoral pursuit.
-[closes book]

15:58.348 --> 16:00.568
I fail to see the connection.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.012
Hard at work, I see.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.319
How did you...?

16:12.362 --> 16:14.408
Those insistent reports
of yours are live, dear.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.366
All of New York
knows you're here.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.064
[chuckles]:
Well,

16:18.107 --> 16:19.413
maybe not allof New York.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.676
How areyour ratings?

16:21.719 --> 16:23.069
What do you want, Mother?

16:23.112 --> 16:25.985
Never lie to me again.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.987
Malcolm is seeing your father,

16:28.030 --> 16:29.466
and you covered for him.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.294
I can't get through
a family dinner

16:31.338 --> 16:32.469
without covering for one of you.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.210
I need you to tell him to stop.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.342
I'm tired of being
in the middle.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.779
-Tell him yourself.
-I have.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.389
I'm worried.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.609
You know what this could do
to your brother.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.219
No, I don't.

16:43.263 --> 16:47.223
Because...
I don't remember my dad.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.486
I was forbidden.

16:51.227 --> 16:54.100
I was protecting you.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.580
-You did.
-Yeah.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.583
You also taught me
to be ashamed of who I am.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.500
I never knew Martin Whitly.

17:03.544 --> 17:06.199
All I know
is what you want me to know.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.376
Maybe that's not enough.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.684
Do you sleep at night?

17:13.728 --> 17:16.035
-[chuckles]: What?
-When you close your eyes,

17:16.078 --> 17:17.688
do you find peace?

17:17.732 --> 17:20.604
That peace
is because of the choices

17:20.648 --> 17:22.389
I made.

17:22.432 --> 17:25.479
You can thank me
anytime you like.

17:34.488 --> 17:37.230
Alice Downey,
Dr. Holton's dead grad student.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.058
There's something there.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.711
[exhales]

17:40.755 --> 17:41.886
What do you think?

17:41.930 --> 17:46.108
Uh, I think Dr. Brown's lying.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.285
Never meet your heroes.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.070
JT:
I sniffed around
the university's

17:51.113 --> 17:52.549
admin building.

17:52.593 --> 17:55.422
They're all just as wild
about Elaine Brown as you are.

17:55.465 --> 17:58.729
But they dug up
an anonymous complaint letter

17:58.773 --> 18:01.558
with some crazy theories
about Alice's suicide.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.691
Handwriting look familiar?

18:09.914 --> 18:11.873
Whoever wrote it
is accusing the psych department

18:11.916 --> 18:14.876
-of off-the-books experiments.
-How off-the-books?

18:14.919 --> 18:17.400
Grad students
were dosing themselves with LSD.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.750
Alice was tripping on acid

18:19.794 --> 18:21.448
when she did a header
off that building.

18:21.491 --> 18:24.755
Uh, psychedelics impair fear
and inhibition.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.409
Perhaps the professors
were measuring

18:26.453 --> 18:28.194
the LSD's effect
on their responses.

18:28.237 --> 18:32.415
This is older than the writing
we found at the crime scene.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.592
It's inflammatory but cogent,

18:35.636 --> 18:38.987
indicating a continuing
and severe decline

18:39.030 --> 18:40.467
in our killer's mental state.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.992
There's something we're missing.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.560
Some meaning in these words.

18:46.603 --> 18:47.952
He wants us to understand him,

18:47.996 --> 18:49.954
to find him.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.565
[phone buzzing]

18:53.741 --> 18:55.482
Detective Powell.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.484
Detective, it's Carl Mitchell.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.225
There's some things
you should know.

18:59.268 --> 19:02.097
Circumstances I couldn't
discuss in front of Elaine.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.359
"Circumstances."

19:03.403 --> 19:05.535
-The truth.
-Dr. Mitchell, where are you?

19:05.579 --> 19:06.971
The research building.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.974
Ninth floor, but I...

19:10.018 --> 19:11.976
Dr. Mitchell? Dr. Mitchell,

19:12.020 --> 19:13.587
can you hear me?

19:13.630 --> 19:16.155
-Dr. Mitchell, are you okay?
-[exhales]

19:16.198 --> 19:18.592
I d-drank it.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.118
I've been dosed.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.381
It's over.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.688
D-Dr. Mitchell?

19:34.434 --> 19:37.480
Security says someone triggered
the roof door alarm.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.443
[muffled whimpering]

19:48.230 --> 19:50.537
[muffled whimpering]

19:53.148 --> 19:54.584
He's still here.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.804
JT:
Police! Come out
with your hands up!

19:58.806 --> 20:00.199
You're safe, Carl.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.680
[Carl muttering indistinctly]

20:10.600 --> 20:12.341
Do you see it?
Do you see it?

20:12.385 --> 20:13.473
[exclaims]
Do you see it?

20:13.516 --> 20:14.996
Do you see how high?

20:15.039 --> 20:16.606
I have to fight, I will fight...

20:16.650 --> 20:20.306
[Carl continues indistinctly]

20:20.349 --> 20:21.394
Oh, please!

20:21.437 --> 20:23.439
-Please! Please.
-You're high on LSD.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.614
In large enough doses,

20:24.658 --> 20:26.007
it can mimic a psychotic break.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.356
[Carl mutters indistinctly]

20:27.400 --> 20:28.705
Who is doing this?

20:28.749 --> 20:30.098
No. No.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.273
The universe, the universe

20:31.317 --> 20:32.622
is doing this-- it wants me.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.321
-[thud]
-JT: Police!

20:36.496 --> 20:37.888
CARL:
And I've got to fight for it.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.716
I've got to fight for it.
[grunts]

20:39.760 --> 20:41.631
Huh?

20:41.675 --> 20:42.937
[Carl mutters indistinctly]

20:42.980 --> 20:43.938
Who? Who? Who?

20:43.981 --> 20:45.069
Who is after you?

20:45.113 --> 20:46.288
-Who is it, huh? Who?
-Don't shoot!

20:46.332 --> 20:47.942
-Who? Who?
-Don't shoot. He's been dosed.

20:47.985 --> 20:48.986
What can you do?

20:49.030 --> 20:51.250
[grunts]
Not a whole hell of a lot.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.468
Oh, it's what they want.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.601
[mutters indistinctly]

20:54.644 --> 20:58.344
I know, we're so high up!
We're so high up! Oh!

20:59.040 --> 21:00.563
[screams]

21:01.303 --> 21:02.478
DANI:
Bright.

21:04.175 --> 21:06.613
[grunting]

21:06.656 --> 21:09.093
Did you know that was there
to break his fall?

21:09.137 --> 21:10.269
[exclaims]

21:10.312 --> 21:11.792
Sure.

21:16.449 --> 21:17.624
So, what am I putting
in our report?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.103
Oh, I don't know.
I like to summarize

21:19.147 --> 21:20.409
what happened at the scene.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.194
"Whack job consultant
pushes vic off roof"?

21:23.238 --> 21:24.674
GIL:
Bright.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.332
Carl Mitchell isn't lucid enough
to make a statement,

21:30.376 --> 21:31.768
but he is in stable condition.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.815
Fractured a rib in the fall.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.384
Something going on with you?

21:38.427 --> 21:39.950
I got a pitch.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.648
"Whack job consultant's

21:41.691 --> 21:43.432
"detailed understanding
of the human psyche

21:46.827 --> 21:49.090
"physical pain might be
the only thing

21:49.133 --> 21:53.355
to deliver the victim from
his psychedelic experience."

21:53.399 --> 21:55.444
-Bright was...
-JT: Oh, you love

21:55.488 --> 21:57.316
saying it, don't you?

21:57.359 --> 21:59.796
Tox screens came back positive.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.669
Carl Mitchell's blood
had extreme levels

22:02.712 --> 22:05.324
of lysergic acid
diethylamide-- LSD.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.674
More than 50 times
a standard dose.

22:07.717 --> 22:10.024
And our original victim Holton?

22:10.067 --> 22:11.330
A similar concentration.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.506
More than enough
to induce extreme panic, fear,

22:13.549 --> 22:14.724
leading to cardiac arrest.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.335
Those levels were no accident.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.337
Our killer doses his victims.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.686
That's his M.O.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.384
To induce the fear
that ultimately kills them.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.690
We're looking
for someone who was harmed
