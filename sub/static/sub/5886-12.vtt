00:00.417 --> 00:02.085
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:02.169 --> 00:04.505
I've seen that look,
and he is in love with you too.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.089
Nothing can happen.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.799
We are going to
get Ocean Spray.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.677
So you need to stop
chasing Sunkist.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.305
Oh, God...

00:14.014 --> 00:15.307
You make me sick!

00:15.474 --> 00:16.725
Sally!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.977
We want you to familiarize
yourself with Chevy.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.355
That is music to my ears.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.441
When there's true love,
it doesn't matter who it is.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.528
I don't know where you've gone,

00:27.694 --> 00:29.780
something has to change.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:33.510 --> 01:35.053
I was waiting up.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.974
I didn't want to wake you.

01:40.726 --> 01:44.271
- Don.
- What?

01:44.313 --> 01:46.815
I don't know what's going on,

01:46.857 --> 01:49.735
but you have to pull back on
the throttle a little, honey.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.757
<i>Don, turn off the range.</i>

02:18.931 --> 02:21.058
Sorry, I forgot about them.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.435
It's fine.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.397
I want to make you
a real breakfast.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.815
You look terrible.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.901
So do you.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.618
Just stay home today.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.411
Can you do that for me?

02:46.208 --> 02:48.460
Please try and sleep it off.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.360
You want to quit
in front of Kenny?

03:13.402 --> 03:14.820
He hasn't fired a shot.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.406
Whatever you fellas want.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.032
Kenny, you need
to discharge that weapon

03:19.074 --> 03:21.618
before Ray turns us
into the Bataan Death March.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.787
You see that tree over there?

03:23.787 --> 03:26.248
Pretend it's Ralph Nerer
and let's go get a drink.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.960
<i>Wait!</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:31.962
Oh, shit.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.631
<i>In recent years,
crime in this country</i>

03:34.673 --> 03:37.968
<i>has grown nine times
as fast as population.</i>

03:37.968 --> 03:40.762
<i>At the current rate, the
crimes of violence in America</i>

03:40.804 --> 03:42.556
<i>will double by 1972.</i>

03:42.598 --> 03:46.268
<i>We cannot accept that kind
of future for America.</i>

03:46.310 --> 03:48.770
<i>We owe it to the decent
and law-abiding citizens</i>

03:48.812 --> 03:50.564
<i>of America to take
the offensive</i>

03:50.606 --> 03:53.317
<i>against the criminal forces
that threaten their peace</i>

03:53.358 --> 03:54.985
<i>and their security</i>

03:54.985 --> 03:58.572
<i>and to rebuild respect
for law across this country.</i>

03:58.614 --> 04:01.700
<i>I pledge to you,
the wave of crime</i>

04:01.742 --> 04:05.329
<i>is not going to be the wave
of the future in America.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:10.125
_

04:16.005 --> 04:17.882
I suppose I'm supposed
to believe

04:17.925 --> 04:20.511
that you didn't know
that she wasn't me

04:20.552 --> 04:23.222
when you took her to the
boathouse and you had your way.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.850
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

04:26.892 --> 04:28.352
<i>- Don't you dare ignore me.</i>

04:28.352 --> 04:29.811
A lot of people
laugh at the idea

04:29.853 --> 04:31.563
of a girl playing the tuba.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.739
<i>- Hello?
- It's me.</i>

04:40.781 --> 04:42.449
Your girl said you were home.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.451
I am.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.328
If you're too sick to talk,
it can wait.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.704
I can talk.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.458
It concerns Sally.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.131
What about her?

04:58.173 --> 05:00.175
She's not coming
this weekend either.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.346
Oh.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.681
That's too bad.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.432
Although you should tell her
if she does come,

05:07.474 --> 05:09.685
I'm gonna be working
all weekend.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.854
Why would I tell her that?

05:13.981 --> 05:17.192
It could have been being
held hostage by that burglar

05:17.192 --> 05:19.570
or the fight she had with
her friend after Model UN,

05:19.611 --> 05:21.363
but she says she's not
going again.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.867
What do you want me
to do about it?

05:27.619 --> 05:29.997
I don't know that it's a
good thing or a bad thing,

05:30.038 --> 05:32.374
but she wants to go away
to a boarding school.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.668
I'll pay for all of it.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.545
She has to get in, of course.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.380
How much does that cost?

05:39.965 --> 05:41.925
Eleanor, Henry's daughter,

05:41.967 --> 05:45.095
went there and I think
she'll interview well.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.598
She has good manners
with everyone but me.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.225
<i>She'll get in.</i>

05:50.267 --> 05:52.978
I don't know, Don.
It is Miss Porter's.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.897
Jackie Kennedy went there.

05:54.897 --> 05:59.234
You mean
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.613
What kind of medicine
are you taking for this cold?

06:02.654 --> 06:05.073
Formula 44.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.909
Yeah, I bet.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.120
Jackie did well twice.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.123
So did you.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.126
<i>- I'm going to go.
- Betts...</i>

06:19.254 --> 06:21.215
will you tell her that Megan...

06:24.676 --> 06:26.512
that we both miss her?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.430
Of course.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.779
Cranberry, Cran-Apple,

06:43.820 --> 06:45.822
Grape-Berry,
that would be Cran-Prune.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.283
Don't let the name fool you.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.786
They're all delicious,
my friend.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.831
Is that the line?

06:53.872 --> 06:56.124
They are one dried

06:56.124 --> 06:58.794
and one fresh fruit
for a new generation.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.171
You want to use Vaughn Meader?

07:01.213 --> 07:03.257
I thought they buried
that guy with JFK.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.801
No, there was this old salt
who took us around the plant.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.262
He had a heavy accent
and a red shirt.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.514
Ted called him Rose Kennedy.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.140
During all this levity,

07:12.182 --> 07:15.727
did you mention that Cran-Prune
sounds like a glass of diarrhea?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.980
When we agreed
to take the blends,

07:18.021 --> 07:20.399
we agreed to take the names.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.818
It's got less pucker
than the Cranberry,

07:22.860 --> 07:25.320
but it's heavier
than the Cran-Apple.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.115
That means
Cran-Apple is light.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.408
Light.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.994
- And Cranberry is...
- Sour?

07:32.035 --> 07:34.454
- Bitter?
- Makes your teeth feel weird?

07:34.496 --> 07:36.331
It's tart.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.958
That's all they keep
saying about the berries.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.043
Yes, they do.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.088
You know, I hate to say this
again, but I got to take a leak.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.757
Great idea.
Peggy.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.801
You want to get some chowdah?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.516
Thought you had to pee.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.810
No, just wanted to see
if I could get him

07:56.852 --> 07:58.812
to respond to an idea
that wasn't hers.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.488
You look better.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.418
Hello?

08:21.460 --> 08:23.378
I can barely hear you.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.633
Oh, hello, Harry.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.722
What?

08:34.765 --> 08:36.558
Listen, I wouldn't
bother you at home.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.936
Obviously I'm on the Coast,
but I've got good news.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.270
You finally found a hooker who
will take traveler's checks?

08:41.313 --> 08:43.607
Why did I tell you that?

08:43.649 --> 08:46.902
I got a packet at the desk and
then a phone call from Sunkist.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.028
I told you to drop that.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.530
Well, Jeffrey, the fat one,

08:49.571 --> 08:51.114
he finally got a look
at the media plan

08:51.156 --> 08:52.908
and suddenly
they're interested in TV.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.285
They've called a meeting with
Sanford, who I think is a decider.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.412
Don't do that.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.374
Don, they're talking about two and
a half times the print budget.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.709
We can't.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.379
- Why not?
- Because we have a conflict.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.297
<i>Ted has Ocean Spray.</i>

09:07.339 --> 09:09.258
You should have
told them we withdrew.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.134
Adios, Harry.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.889
I really didn't want
you to work today.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.724
Harry is such
a pain in the ass.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.978
Let's get out of here.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.363
That was really, really scary.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.702
It was disturbing.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.293
Hello.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.881
Oh, hello.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.757
That was quite a film.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.885
It was terrifying, wasn't it?

09:52.885 --> 09:55.429
Well, we were, um...

09:55.470 --> 09:58.682
you know we're doing the St.
Joseph's spot based on it

09:58.724 --> 10:01.018
and Peggy and I had an argument

10:01.059 --> 10:03.103
about whether there was
a Japanese in the end.

10:03.145 --> 10:06.231
You know, when Mia Farrow
walks in and sees the baby

10:06.231 --> 10:07.524
and the devil worshippers
are there.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.527
- There was.
- I know.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.572
So you'd both already seen it?

10:13.572 --> 10:14.907
Yeah.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.242
But obviously she
remembered it better.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.119
She wants a Japanese in the ad.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.706
They always have a camera.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.792
We're going to grab a bite.
Have you eaten?

10:25.834 --> 10:28.420
I should get going.
I have a date.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.548
Yes, well,
don't let us keep you.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.887
So, Don, I see
you're feeling better.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.889
I had to get him
out of the house.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.599
We can still go eat.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.268
I am supposed to throw
around a football.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.354
- I should go.
- After you.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.066
Oh, my God.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.954
I would never live
in an apartment that old.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.456
There's so many buildings
like that in Montreal.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.583
It's creepy.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.126
Don?

11:09.253 --> 11:11.755
What?
I'm gonna have nightmares.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.968
You know who's not gonna sleep?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.761
Why are you
so interested in this?

11:17.803 --> 11:19.304
You're not interested?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.931
Honestly, I'm more
troubled by the idea

11:20.973 --> 11:23.976
of using "Rosemary's Baby"
for a children's aspirin ad.

11:23.976 --> 11:26.603
Why were they going
to the movies at 5:00?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.522
They didn't think
anybody would be there.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.190
You've been on a soap too long.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.235
I don't know.
I guess.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.238
What time is it in California?

11:36.280 --> 11:38.407
Three hours earlier.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.202
I need to make a phone call.

11:44.163 --> 11:46.081
Okay.

11:53.172 --> 11:54.840
What happened?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.592
Come in.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.847
What the hell happened?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.974
I'm fine.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.934
Well, obviously not.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.519
I thought you were in Detroit.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.605
I was.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.523
I told them that
Cynthia was pregnant

12:11.565 --> 12:13.358
and they took me out to
celebrate and they shot me.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.319
- What?
- It's not funny.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.573
Chevy is killing me.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.910
I hate Detroit.

12:22.951 --> 12:26.079
I hate cars.
I hate guns.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.916
I don't even want
to look at a steak anymore.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.547
The only way
to get through this

12:35.589 --> 12:37.799
is to keep reminding yourself
it's a great account.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.927
I'm gonna be a father.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.262
- I'm gonna have a family.
- Pull yourself together.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.723
Anyone here would trade
places with you in a second.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.767
Did I tell you that
on the way to the hospital,

12:46.808 --> 12:49.019
they tried to stop for lunch?

12:49.061 --> 12:52.105
They're fat yahoos in cheap suits.
I'm done.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.316
Are you entertaining this idea?

12:54.358 --> 12:57.444
You'll be laughed out of this building
and then out of advertising in general.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.280
It'd be a difficult transition.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.282
Chevy won't like it,

13:02.324 --> 13:04.785
but I think they're feeling
pretty guilty right now.

13:10.332 --> 13:14.294
Well, if it's in your power...

13:15.337 --> 13:16.672
and you're willing to give up

13:16.672 --> 13:19.341
what goes with it,

13:19.383 --> 13:22.302
I would gladly take your place.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.638
What about your family?

13:25.848 --> 13:27.349
Trudy and I are separated.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.268
I only see Tammy
every other weekend.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.727
She won't know the difference.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.771
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.732
Yes, it's unfortunate.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.194
I don't know what to say.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.447
Say you'll back me up
and I'll be there for you.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.705
Congratulations on the baby.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.540
Thank you.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.466
Is he ready?

14:02.885 --> 14:04.344
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.180
- Morning.
- Hello.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.019
We have what we think is some
pretty spectacular news.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.770
Crane called from Los Angeles.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.606
Sunkist finally looked
at the media plan

14:15.647 --> 14:18.025
and enthusiastically embraced
a television campaign

14:18.066 --> 14:20.944
to the tune of $8 million.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.822
Great Caesar's ghost.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.868
They don't care that we're
a month into Ocean Spray?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.870
Harry said we'd resign.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.706
Apparently they were excited
by the spike in color TVs.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.791
Don told them that
was the secret. Color.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.212
- When did you tell them that?
- When we were out there.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.214
But they wouldn't
leave Harry alone.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.384
You upset, Ted? It's almost
three times the business.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.554
No, I just...

14:47.596 --> 14:50.098
well, I'm dreading
making the call.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.850
Well, I'll call Ocean Spray.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.685
And the rest of our clients?

14:53.727 --> 14:56.355
Someone has to let them know to
look out for a knife in their back.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.898
You want to turn it down?

14:57.898 --> 15:00.234
Absolutely not.
Don't be an idiot, Ted.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.236
Stay out of this, Jim.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.071
Forget about giving
someone your word,

15:04.112 --> 15:06.573
which obviously doesn't
mean anything to you...

15:07.908 --> 15:09.535
how does it look?

15:09.576 --> 15:12.079
The right hand doesn't know
what the left hand is doing.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.666
You're right.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.751
We should work more together.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.711
We have to. That's the
message from this.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.256
Then it's agreed
that we have a more

15:22.297 --> 15:24.091
coherent approach
to new business.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.134
That means no more
surprises, Don.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.179
You're right.
I apologize.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.890
But it's a great account.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.642
Can we celebrate now?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.898
I think Peggy should be on it.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.942
She has, you know,
juice experience now.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.986
That makes sense.

15:47.281 --> 15:48.740
What are you doing?

15:48.782 --> 15:50.993
Getting ready to do
a little hunting.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.121
What's going on?
Mr. Cooper wants to see you.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.458
Let's find out.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.753
That's a .22. It's not good for
anything but squirrels, you know.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.676
Would you ever leave New
York, Annie Oakley?

16:14.099 --> 16:17.519
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello, Bob.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.396
Kenny, how are you feeling?

16:19.438 --> 16:21.857
Better than I am right now.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.817
Have a seat.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.987
Well, shiver me timbers.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.948
I'd laugh, but it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

16:29.990 --> 16:34.286
For obvious reasons, Ken is
withdrawing from handling Chevy.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.205
You sure you want to do this?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.623
I'm positive.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.751
Kenny, you know,
I once had a client

16:40.792 --> 16:42.503
cup my wife's breast.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.380
Lee Garner, Jr.
made me hold his balls.

16:46.632 --> 16:49.468
Well, I'm not resigning Chevy.

16:49.468 --> 16:52.471
I just can't be on the
ground there anymore.

16:52.471 --> 16:54.223
Pete and I have
already discussed it,

16:54.264 --> 16:57.351
and I will stay on the business in New York.
They'll want that.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.478
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't reluctant.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.897
But I know Ken would do
the same for me.

17:01.939 --> 17:04.983
Crocodile tears.
How quaint.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.818
Look, I know
everyone's worried,

17:06.818 --> 17:08.987
but Bob's going to be a big
help with the transition.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.321
Anything I can do.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.699
In all deference to the weeks

17:12.741 --> 17:15.117
Bob spent trying
to develop ties with Chevy,

17:15.160 --> 17:17.246
I think it's best
if I bring in my own team.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.579
That's a dumb idea.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.665
Any continuity
preserves the belief

17:20.707 --> 17:22.667
that service has not changed.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.339
It's nothing about Bob
in particular,

17:27.339 --> 17:30.217
but isn't it better
to create the belief

17:30.259 --> 17:32.219
that service has improved?

17:32.261 --> 17:35.514
Pete, you're going to need to know
where the landmines are buried.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.350
I'd listen to the cyclops, Pete.

17:38.350 --> 17:41.645
I think maybe I'm keeping you
from discussing this freely.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.441
I understand Pete's objections,

17:46.483 --> 17:48.735
but I will do
whatever is decided.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.577
Pete, there's nothing
to discuss.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.704
I like Bob, Chevy likes Bob.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.539
And if you don't like Bob,

18:00.581 --> 18:02.583
we can find someone who does.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.005
Of course.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.842
By the way, thank you,

18:11.884 --> 18:14.469
all of you, for having
this trust in me.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.982
Is there a problem?

18:27.024 --> 18:28.358
I don't want to work with you.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.818
I don't want to stay
in a hotel with you.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.529
- You're sick.
- Why would you say that?

18:33.947 --> 18:36.533
So you didn't profess
your love to me?

18:36.575 --> 18:40.120
Only my admiration,
which is waning quickly.

18:40.162 --> 18:43.123
This is not about my own interests.
I care about Chevy.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.336
You should watch
what you say to people.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.131
Is that right?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.217
Congratulations.

18:53.217 --> 18:55.385
Can you believe this guy?

18:56.637 --> 18:59.973
- So?
- So what?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.400
Can I have one?

19:14.446 --> 19:16.281
Are you anxious?

19:16.281 --> 19:18.742
I expect you to sail
through this interview.

19:18.784 --> 19:21.286
Jeez, I wasn't nervous
about it a minute ago.

19:21.328 --> 19:25.249
I hope it doesn't ruin it
that I'm excited for you.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.167
When I was in 10th grade,
my friend Annie left--

19:27.209 --> 19:30.462
To go to Rosemary Hall.
I know, you told me.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.966
Did I tell you
she hated her mother?

19:34.925 --> 19:36.218
Good for her.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.265
Is it about getting
away from boys?

19:41.306 --> 19:44.268
If I say yes,
will you stop asking?

19:44.309 --> 19:47.437
I'm proposing some reasons because
you aren't being very forthcoming.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.819
Sally, I can turn
this car around.

19:55.571 --> 19:59.116
I want to be a grown-up, but I know
how important my education is.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.204
Oh.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.337
Well, congratulations.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.840
You log a few months on that,
you can work anywhere.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.633
I'm not looking anymore.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.552
So what is this?
That old joke

20:18.594 --> 20:19.970
"Hell, I'm telling everyone"?

20:20.012 --> 20:23.265
No, I'm calling on behalf
of a young account man

20:23.307 --> 20:26.226
whom we love, but can't promote
because Draper doesn't like him.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.520
So you're looking
for an account man?

20:28.562 --> 20:30.189
You know you can't work here.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.611
I'll be frank.

20:35.611 --> 20:37.404
I got to get this kid
out of here

20:37.446 --> 20:39.865
and he's not going
to call you himself.

20:39.907 --> 20:42.159
I'd love to present
some concrete options to him

20:42.201 --> 20:44.244
when I push him out the door.
I just need leads.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.662
He doesn't have
to land anything.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.123
He must be pretty good
if he's in your way.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.584
He's eager to please.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.504
Handsome.
His name is Bob Benson.

20:53.545 --> 20:56.465
He has a blue blood connection
to Brown Brothers Harriman.

20:56.507 --> 20:59.301
Beloit, Wharton. I'll send
over his personnel file.

20:59.343 --> 21:00.761
And I'll send over a bill.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.222
Make it an even grand.
Cash.

21:03.222 --> 21:05.224
No, no, no, no.

21:05.265 --> 21:09.144
_

21:09.269 --> 21:11.188
_

21:11.313 --> 21:12.981
_

21:13.106 --> 21:14.858
_

21:22.032 --> 21:24.993
- What going on in there?
- Someone's having a good time.

21:36.839 --> 21:39.466
You do realize this is the best
picture these people will ever take?

21:39.508 --> 21:42.302
We were thinking about putting
this old man in a wig

21:42.344 --> 21:44.388
because he looks
so much like Ruth Gordon.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.893
- Fill me in.
- That's a great idea.

21:49.935 --> 21:52.729
The conceit is that it's shot
from the baby's point of view.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.523
No, no, let's do
the ad for him.

21:54.565 --> 21:56.191
Joan, come here.

21:57.276 --> 21:58.902
Can I do it from here?

21:58.902 --> 22:00.404
No.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.156
So, Don, you are
the camera and the baby.

22:03.198 --> 22:06.243
We might have the end of the basinet
right at the front of the frame.

22:06.243 --> 22:08.453
Maybe see some kicking
toes under a blanket.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.164
Should I get down
a little lower?

22:10.205 --> 22:12.207
No, that's fine.

22:12.249 --> 22:14.293
Okay, it's dark.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.295
Fish-eye lens,
you're the baby.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.672
Just, "Whaa!
Whaa!"

22:18.714 --> 22:23.093
- You do that.
- Whaa! Whaa! Whaa!

22:23.093 --> 22:24.428
Okay.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.430
So there's a crowd.
Eight or nine people.

22:26.471 --> 22:29.308
It's the whole coven. And there's
a crazy little old lady.

22:29.349 --> 22:32.060
What you need
is a mustard plaster.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.687
And then there's
this wrinkled old man.

22:33.729 --> 22:35.981
You need a compress.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.608
And then a Jewish
neighbor lady.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.693
How about a bowl
of chicken soup?

22:39.735 --> 22:41.820
<i>Anyway, there's one
more of those, maybe.</i>

22:41.862 --> 22:44.156
Then they all start
crowding in on you.

22:44.198 --> 22:46.283
And the Japanese
takes a picture

22:46.325 --> 22:48.494
and the flash turns it white.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.663
Then you see the beautiful,
radiant young mother.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.921
You don't need anyone's
help but St. Joseph's.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.509
Usually with things like this, it
depends on you knowing the movie.

23:05.052 --> 23:06.637
But I think this
works on its own.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.222
I told you it was good.

23:08.263 --> 23:09.473
That's a lot of people.

23:09.473 --> 23:11.350
You need to feel
the conspiracy.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.644
You want me to come to casting?

23:13.644 --> 23:15.562
Sure, but I'm just gonna watch.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.689
It was all her.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.901
Casting's on the West Side.
You should go.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.493
That's a lot of people.

23:29.535 --> 23:31.912
I didn't want to dampen
the enthusiasm,

23:31.954 --> 23:34.498
but the approved budget
is $15,000.

23:34.498 --> 23:38.502
There's at least $35,000
in residuals alone here.

23:38.544 --> 23:40.254
What did
St. Joseph's say?

23:40.295 --> 23:42.130
They haven't seen
the new budget.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.049
So who's paying for casting?

23:44.091 --> 23:45.801
We are.

23:45.843 --> 23:48.262
But Ted seems confident
they'll be good for it.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.389
So he wants to spring it on
them at the pre-pro meeting

23:50.430 --> 23:52.224
after we're 10 grand
out of pocket?

23:52.266 --> 23:54.977
I don't know, Don.
I don't tell him what to do.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.865
And Diplomacy Club.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.658
I don't know if she told
you in the interview,

24:09.658 --> 24:12.119
but Henry thinks she can
be an ambassador one day.

24:12.161 --> 24:14.830
It's heartwarming to see
such a proud mother.

24:14.830 --> 24:19.376
Well, Sally going away
is going to be difficult,

24:19.418 --> 24:21.962
but, of course, I wanted it
for myself way back when.

24:22.004 --> 24:23.839
And in this day and age,
it's overwhelming

24:23.881 --> 24:26.466
to raise a young girl,
let alone be one.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.010
Beautifully put.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.179
Now, Sally,
during your overnight

24:30.179 --> 24:32.014
and tomorrow in class,

24:32.055 --> 24:35.225
I want you to keep in mind, and
I'm sure your mother would agree,

24:35.267 --> 24:37.978
this is as much for you
to find out about us

24:37.978 --> 24:41.106
as it is for us
to find out about you.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.906
Carla, could you fetch Millicent
Turner from study hall?

24:49.907 --> 24:51.450
You have fun.

24:51.492 --> 24:53.035
I'll be back
in the morning around--

24:53.035 --> 24:54.620
2:30 would be perfect.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.211
Thank you again.

25:08.509 --> 25:11.220
<i>Mr. Campbell, your
mother is here to see you.</i>

25:14.890 --> 25:16.642
What are you
doing here, Mother?

25:16.683 --> 25:18.393
Josephine, you have
my phone number.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.229
This doesn't concern her.

25:20.229 --> 25:22.272
I'm here for my passport.

25:22.272 --> 25:26.235
I'm planning a voyage.
And I spoke to Manolo.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.278
I forbade you to see him.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.072
Well, he's very upset
about the way

25:30.113 --> 25:31.949
you're treating
his friend Bob Benson.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.034
That Spanish fly.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.702
Why are you still
in contact with him?

25:35.744 --> 25:38.247
- I ran into him.
- Where?

25:38.288 --> 25:40.165
I don't remember.

25:40.207 --> 25:44.086
Tell Manolo that I almost
threw you down the steps

25:44.127 --> 25:45.546
when you brought up his friend.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.382
Peter, I am still your mother.

25:48.382 --> 25:50.551
I don't have your passport.

25:50.551 --> 25:52.970
I'm sure it's expired
like everything else you own.

25:53.011 --> 25:54.555
Josephine!

25:54.596 --> 25:56.598
You're endangering
your position.

26:00.769 --> 26:02.437
So, this used to be
the living room.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.398
And, of course, you have to walk
through my room to get to her room,

26:04.439 --> 26:06.775
but we switch over
at Christmas.

26:06.817 --> 26:08.902
I'd rather have
my own room, too.

26:08.944 --> 26:11.446
Oh, hello.

26:11.488 --> 26:13.073
You must be Sally.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.783
I'm Mandy.
Move over.

26:16.952 --> 26:20.372
Sally's family lives
in Rye and Manhattan.

26:20.414 --> 26:22.541
Let me guess, dad's remarried,

26:22.583 --> 26:24.042
mom's fat and sad.

26:24.084 --> 26:26.670
No, they're both remarried,

26:26.712 --> 26:28.964
but my dad's wife is my age.

26:30.299 --> 26:33.010
Well, I'd like
to feel sorry for you,

26:33.051 --> 26:35.179
but things are about
to get worse.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.807
Don't you like it here?

26:38.849 --> 26:40.809
You're not allowed
to talk anymore.

26:40.851 --> 26:44.062
Our opinion is crucial
to your acceptance.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.814
And I can't believe
no one told you

26:45.856 --> 26:49.234
that you were supposed
to look after us.

26:49.276 --> 26:51.987
You didn't bring a bottle
or some cigarettes at least?

26:53.113 --> 26:54.573
I probably have some money.

26:55.616 --> 26:57.493
You think we need money?

26:57.493 --> 26:59.244
You should call your mother.

26:59.286 --> 27:00.954
Tell her that you're useless.

27:02.164 --> 27:03.790
I can get you
anything you want.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.417
She keeps talking.

27:05.459 --> 27:07.836
Now what do we want?

27:14.134 --> 27:15.552
How was casting?

27:15.594 --> 27:18.847
It was interrupted by a phone
call from St. Joseph's.

27:18.889 --> 27:20.516
Did you send over a budget?

27:20.557 --> 27:23.268
Yes, but relax.
I talked to them.

27:23.310 --> 27:24.978
I played the bad guy.
They'll be fine.

27:24.978 --> 27:27.022
No, they won't be.

27:27.064 --> 27:30.275
They called me
at casting to stop it.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.152
Now I have to turn
a no into a yes.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.987
You were gonna have
to do that anyway.

27:33.987 --> 27:36.448
I couldn't
even tell Peggy.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.534
Did you tell her
how expensive it was?

27:38.575 --> 27:41.370
It's great work
and you know it.

27:41.411 --> 27:44.039
St. Joseph's has been doing
the same ad for 20 years.

27:44.081 --> 27:45.916
They're bread and butter.
Why did you pick them to push?

27:45.958 --> 27:49.169
They kept asking me for their
"plop plop fizz fizz."

27:49.169 --> 27:51.505
And all of a sudden
she comes up with this.

27:51.547 --> 27:54.091
She can smell the Clio, Don.

27:54.132 --> 27:56.301
Remember your first big ad?

27:56.343 --> 27:57.845
She has her heart set on it.

27:57.886 --> 28:01.515
It's okay, Ted.
I get it.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.937
You're right.
They're coming in tomorrow.

28:06.979 --> 28:08.689
Just back me up on this?

28:08.730 --> 28:10.065
Of course.

28:10.107 --> 28:12.317
I've got to go
over that budget.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.371
Yeah, she stayed skinny,

28:24.371 --> 28:27.207
but her breath smelled
like vomit all the time.

28:27.207 --> 28:30.669
I think it's time for
you girls to go to bed.

28:30.711 --> 28:32.963
You hemmed your skirt.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.716
My friend Sandy used a stapler.

28:35.716 --> 28:38.677
Then by the time she went home,
her legs were all scratched.

28:38.719 --> 28:41.597
Stand still.
Sally, you there?

28:42.723 --> 28:45.517
Hello.

28:50.981 --> 28:52.399
That was pretty fast.

28:52.441 --> 28:53.650
Hey.

28:53.692 --> 28:56.320
I'm Mandy
and this is Millicent.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.280
Hold on, do you
have a rope for him?

28:58.322 --> 29:00.866
Millicent, go get him.

29:00.908 --> 29:02.618
<i>Go around the front.</i>

29:05.329 --> 29:07.956
Nice digs.
I'm Glen, by the way.

29:07.998 --> 29:09.791
Did you have trouble
finding us?

29:09.833 --> 29:12.085
Rolo's driven by before.

29:12.085 --> 29:13.921
Then I just looked for Snoopy.

29:13.921 --> 29:15.672
Do you want a cigarette?

29:15.714 --> 29:18.425
No, but I wouldn't
mind a drink.

29:18.467 --> 29:20.886
Rolo brought
something to smoke.

29:23.305 --> 29:25.682
How you been?
How are you folks?

29:25.724 --> 29:27.559
Can we drink it straight?

29:27.601 --> 29:29.853
I know how to make
a Tom Collins.

29:29.895 --> 29:32.731
- She's too much.
- She's okay.

29:34.441 --> 29:37.611
I don't think anyone saw us,
but we should keep it quiet.

29:37.653 --> 29:39.571
I'm Rolo, by the way.

29:39.613 --> 29:41.490
Nice digs.

29:41.532 --> 29:43.116
What about the proctor?

29:43.158 --> 29:45.244
The housemother's
a booze fiend.

29:45.285 --> 29:47.287
I'll save some for her.

29:47.329 --> 29:49.706
I want to get stoned.

29:49.748 --> 29:51.333
I need a surface.

29:58.966 --> 30:00.384
Here's looking up
your old address.

30:14.231 --> 30:15.482
Hello?

30:15.524 --> 30:18.610
Look at the two of us,
burning the midnight oil.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.946
Something wrong? Did the
messenger find you okay?

30:20.988 --> 30:24.575
I'm gonna need more than this kid
Bob Benson's personnel record.

30:24.616 --> 30:26.660
Might as well
be written in steam.

30:26.702 --> 30:28.620
What do you mean?

30:28.662 --> 30:30.581
I don't even know
if the name is real.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.833
I don't know where he went to
college, but it wasn't Beloit.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.543
I tried a buddy at Wharton,

30:34.585 --> 30:36.461
he said maybe he's just
telling people Wharton,

30:36.461 --> 30:38.839
so he's gonna check the whole
University of Pennsylvania.

30:38.881 --> 30:41.967
But it's tough when I don't know
if he's really 28 years old.

30:42.009 --> 30:45.345
The most interesting is the
Brown Brothers Harriman job.

30:45.387 --> 30:46.972
You told me that.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.473
I got that from him.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.893
Well, I have a friend there.

30:50.934 --> 30:53.145
Turns out they all
remember Bobby.

30:53.187 --> 30:55.022
He's from West Virginia.

30:55.063 --> 30:58.108
Parents are brother
and sister or something.

30:58.150 --> 31:00.152
He was a manservant
for three years

31:00.194 --> 31:01.904
to a senior vice president.

31:01.945 --> 31:05.407
He took him to
Europe on the Queen Elizabeth.

31:05.449 --> 31:06.658
Are you kidding me?

31:06.700 --> 31:08.243
He had three references,

31:08.285 --> 31:11.246
two nonworking numbers at K&E
and a live one at Cunningham.

31:11.288 --> 31:13.207
They said he just
disappeared one day

31:13.248 --> 31:15.876
with an electric pencil sharpener
and the Christmas card list.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.503
So what does that mean?

31:17.544 --> 31:20.297
Mostly that his only
job opportunity

31:20.339 --> 31:22.341
was someplace dumb enough
not to ask any questions,

31:22.382 --> 31:24.384
and so far,
that's just you guys.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.554
I'd offer to return the money,

31:27.596 --> 31:30.098
but I would file this
under valuable information.

31:31.225 --> 31:33.060
Yes, of course.

31:33.101 --> 31:36.021
I've never seen
anything like this before.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.440
I have.

31:47.866 --> 31:50.410
You can do that
in bed, you know.

31:58.961 --> 32:01.129
Since seventh grade.

32:01.171 --> 32:03.465
The Ro is from Ronnie
and the Lo is from Lowell.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.259
So they just started
calling me Rolo.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.844
And 'cause he rolls
a lot of joints.

32:08.679 --> 32:10.264
Should I roll another?

32:10.305 --> 32:13.392
Your friend bogarted the last
one and she didn't get any.

32:13.433 --> 32:14.852
I'm really drunk.

32:14.893 --> 32:16.353
You think Millicent's okay?

32:16.395 --> 32:18.981
She always freaks out.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.358
What if she runs
screaming down the hallway

32:21.358 --> 32:23.026
and she thinks
her hair is on fire

32:23.026 --> 32:26.363
and she's screaming, "Boy on the floor!
Boy on the floor"?

32:27.865 --> 32:29.825
Do you two know each other?

32:30.909 --> 32:33.370
I think so, but who knows?

32:33.412 --> 32:35.455
I was reincarnated.

32:35.497 --> 32:37.499
I came back as a fish.

32:37.541 --> 32:40.377
You should read my diary.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.133
Come on.

32:50.846 --> 32:52.556
Ahem.

32:55.184 --> 32:57.394
Nice shot.

32:59.062 --> 33:00.898
I've got good hands.

33:04.318 --> 33:06.278
Do you play basketball?

33:13.076 --> 33:14.703
I've been with lots of girls.

33:14.745 --> 33:16.788
I know what I'm doing.

33:18.582 --> 33:21.210
What kind of music do you like?

33:23.337 --> 33:25.547
I don't want to talk anymore.

33:29.092 --> 33:32.012
What's going on, Sally?
You called us.

33:32.054 --> 33:33.931
You made us drive
all the way over here.

33:33.931 --> 33:35.766
Suddenly you don't want
to fool around?

33:35.766 --> 33:37.100
Are you frigid?

33:40.187 --> 33:42.940
Glen. Glen, come out.

33:42.981 --> 33:44.566
Hey, come on.
You've got to relax.

33:44.608 --> 33:46.610
What do you want?

33:46.652 --> 33:48.362
He won't leave me alone.

33:48.403 --> 33:51.532
What the hell, Rolo? I told
you she's like my sister.

33:51.573 --> 33:53.200
I think you're
full of shit, man.

33:53.242 --> 33:55.202
You just wanted the good one.

33:55.244 --> 33:56.745
What is going on?

33:56.787 --> 33:58.539
He tried to force me.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.916
What?
Damn it, Rolo.

34:00.958 --> 34:02.626
She's a lying little tease.

34:02.668 --> 34:04.628
That's bullshit.

34:07.464 --> 34:08.966
Keep it down.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.637
Get off me, Bishop.

34:23.605 --> 34:26.775
Are you suicidal?
I'm your ride home.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.536
He'll be fine.
I got to go.

34:37.578 --> 34:40.956
I don't want to hitch.
Are you all right?

34:42.498 --> 34:45.418
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.297
I'm sorry.

34:48.338 --> 34:50.424
Keep in touch.

34:56.138 --> 34:57.639
How do you know him?

34:57.639 --> 34:59.474
We grew up together.

34:59.516 --> 35:01.977
You like trouble, don't you?

35:12.112 --> 35:13.864
Good morning.

35:13.906 --> 35:15.616
Are you joining us?

35:15.657 --> 35:18.202
Ted wanted more firepower.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.953
I thought I'd pitch in.

35:19.995 --> 35:21.788
I don't understand
what happened.

35:21.830 --> 35:25.250
Residuals. Can't let
them sneak up on you.

35:25.292 --> 35:27.503
It'll be fine.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.338
We always win this one.

35:29.379 --> 35:32.174
Well, I see
everything's in order,

35:32.174 --> 35:34.468
including our cookies
from Ferrara's.

35:34.510 --> 35:37.179
Byron, you remember
Peggy Olson.

35:37.221 --> 35:39.431
- Mr. Poole, nice to see you again.
- Byron.

35:39.473 --> 35:42.184
And Don Draper, of course,
our other creative director.

35:42.226 --> 35:44.186
Yes, and I'm sorry
about the phone call,

35:44.228 --> 35:45.854
but it was a bit of a surprise.

35:45.896 --> 35:50.025
But you're here and we are
going to set you at ease.

35:50.067 --> 35:53.195
Now Ted and Peggy will take you
through the creative process

35:53.195 --> 35:55.405
that resulted
in this ingenious spot.

35:55.447 --> 35:57.699
I know what it is. I bought
it the day I heard it.

35:57.699 --> 35:59.284
I just paid a lot less for it.

35:59.326 --> 36:02.621
Well, as a concept
becomes more developed,

36:02.663 --> 36:04.623
expenses can mount.

36:04.665 --> 36:06.708
We want to do this right.

36:06.750 --> 36:10.337
The cost is still a fraction of the
business we believe it will generate.

36:10.379 --> 36:12.798
Ted, with all due respect,

36:12.840 --> 36:14.633
it's not your job
to promise sales.

36:14.675 --> 36:17.302
It's your job to deliver work
for the budget agreed to.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.304
It turned out to be
more people than we thought.

36:19.346 --> 36:21.098
That's why we sent
the budget over.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.600
We didn't want there
to be any surprises.

36:23.642 --> 36:25.769
But this is worth the money.

36:25.811 --> 36:27.688
But this is a surprise.

36:27.729 --> 36:29.731
We agreed to 15,000
and it's 50.

36:29.773 --> 36:32.276
You said specifically

36:32.317 --> 36:34.403
that you wanted
something contemporary

36:34.403 --> 36:35.821
with a sense of humor,

36:35.863 --> 36:38.407
something that wouldn't
make young parents

36:38.448 --> 36:40.284
feel like old people.

36:40.325 --> 36:42.536
This does that and more.

36:43.871 --> 36:45.289
That's not a reason.

36:45.330 --> 36:47.207
Well, it should be.

36:47.249 --> 36:50.043
We have enough of a history that
you should trust my judgment.

36:50.085 --> 36:52.880
No, I want a reason.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.423
I'm entitled.

36:54.464 --> 36:57.134
You know the raft of shit I
caught when this budget came in?

36:58.677 --> 36:59.887
Mr. Plough called me.

36:59.928 --> 37:03.140
Uh, I hate to interrupt.

37:04.558 --> 37:07.519
I think, Byron, I know
what you want to hear.

37:07.561 --> 37:09.521
And it has nothing to do

37:09.563 --> 37:12.691
with the shooting days
or the cast

37:12.733 --> 37:14.318
because you've had
a long and fruitful

37:14.359 --> 37:16.904
creative relationship together.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.406
I think, and correct me
if I'm wrong,

37:19.448 --> 37:21.575
that when you say
you want a reason,

37:21.617 --> 37:24.453
you want to know why
we would push you like this.

37:24.495 --> 37:26.038
It would help.

37:26.079 --> 37:29.166
Well, the truth is

37:29.208 --> 37:31.752
that I don't think
Ted wants to say.

37:33.420 --> 37:37.216
'Cause it's, well,

37:37.257 --> 37:39.760
it's a little bit personal.

37:41.470 --> 37:43.597
In fact, it's very personal.

37:48.519 --> 37:50.812
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

37:50.854 --> 37:52.773
Yes, you do.

38:02.032 --> 38:03.534
Are you okay, Ted?

38:08.539 --> 38:10.916
I, uh...

38:10.958 --> 38:13.126
It's okay.

38:13.126 --> 38:14.962
Tell him, Ted.

38:16.004 --> 38:17.464
You don't want to say anything?

38:20.133 --> 38:22.052
All right.

38:22.094 --> 38:24.638
I'll tell him.

38:26.265 --> 38:29.560
It's hard for Ted to say,

38:29.601 --> 38:33.355
but this was
Frank Gleason's last idea.

38:37.943 --> 38:40.154
Really?

38:40.154 --> 38:41.989
Yes.

38:41.989 --> 38:44.658
I'm afraid we've gotten
a little sentimental.

38:47.035 --> 38:49.580
Damn. You should
have told me that.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.043
I guess I was--
I don't know.

38:55.085 --> 38:57.629
I, uh...

38:57.671 --> 39:00.257
the factor didn't seem
relevant except to us.

39:00.299 --> 39:02.301
I, um...

39:04.428 --> 39:06.346
didn't want to lean on that.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.519
Frank was a hell of a guy.

39:12.519 --> 39:14.271
Best I can do is 25.

39:14.313 --> 39:16.815
I don't care if you make these
characters out of cardboard

39:16.857 --> 39:19.276
or turn them into cartoons,
you got to reduce the cast.

39:19.318 --> 39:22.488
- That's all you get.
- I understand.

39:25.324 --> 39:27.117
I'll show you out.

39:30.204 --> 39:32.664
You should come to
Piping Rock this Sunday.

39:32.706 --> 39:34.833
Get in a few holes
before all the grass dies.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.752
We'll see.

39:37.836 --> 39:39.755
Was that really necessary?

39:42.883 --> 39:44.384
Leave us alone.

39:55.687 --> 39:57.814
<i>What was that?</i>

39:57.856 --> 39:59.900
That was the best I could do.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.986
Do you want me
to tell him the truth?

40:03.028 --> 40:04.613
What are you talking about?

40:04.655 --> 40:06.490
You're not thinking
with your head.

40:06.532 --> 40:09.952
That was your solution?
Try and embarrass me?

40:09.993 --> 40:11.870
You're embarrassing yourself.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.747
I know your little girl
has beautiful eyes,

40:13.789 --> 40:15.290
but that doesn't mean
you give her everything.

40:15.332 --> 40:17.084
That has nothing to do with it.

40:17.125 --> 40:19.878
Come on, we've all been there.

40:19.878 --> 40:21.380
I mean, not with Peggy.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.215
Don't say that about her.

40:23.257 --> 40:25.717
Ted, you're kidding yourself.

40:25.759 --> 40:28.595
Everybody sees it.
Just ask your secretary.

40:30.556 --> 40:32.850
Your judgment is impaired.

40:34.685 --> 40:36.728
You're not thinking
with your head.

40:52.995 --> 40:54.496
Good morning, Bob.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.375
How you doing, boss?

40:58.417 --> 41:00.919
I thought for certain you would
have brought me a coffee today.

41:02.796 --> 41:04.590
You want me to go get one?

41:06.717 --> 41:09.761
I've always wondered how
you were so expertly servile.

41:09.761 --> 41:12.723
But now I know. It used
to be your profession.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.727
What do you want?

41:16.768 --> 41:19.229
Well, for one thing,
I wanted you to stop smiling.

41:22.149 --> 41:23.567
You got it.

41:23.609 --> 41:25.777
I've been awake all night
wondering what you do

41:25.777 --> 41:27.279
when you're found out.

41:27.279 --> 41:28.906
This must have happened before.

41:28.947 --> 41:31.492
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:31.533 --> 41:33.869
- Who hired you?
- You did.

41:33.911 --> 41:35.871
When?

41:35.913 --> 41:38.123
I met with Ken.
You walked in,

41:38.165 --> 41:40.709
complimented my tie
and walked out.

41:40.751 --> 41:43.337
It was the best day of my life.

41:44.796 --> 41:48.425
Well, your fraud
is irrefutable.

41:49.468 --> 41:51.094
Can I have a day's head start?

41:51.094 --> 41:52.971
Can you give me that at least

41:53.013 --> 41:54.681
after all I've done for you?

41:54.723 --> 41:58.227
You've done more for
me than I've done for you.

41:58.268 --> 41:59.937
Spectacular.

41:59.978 --> 42:03.357
You don't respond well
to gratitude.

42:03.398 --> 42:05.108
So you're just going to run?

42:05.150 --> 42:06.860
I don't believe you.

42:06.902 --> 42:09.321
It terrifies me what
you could do in a day.

42:09.363 --> 42:12.533
No, Bob, you're going to get
the benefit of the fact

42:12.574 --> 42:14.868
that I've been here before.

42:14.910 --> 42:17.621
I don't know how
people like you do it.

42:17.621 --> 42:19.623
You're certainly
better at it than I am

42:19.623 --> 42:21.458
at whatever I do.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.794
But I would like to think
that I have learned

42:23.794 --> 42:26.004
not to tangle with
your kind of animal.

42:26.046 --> 42:28.674
I don't understand.

42:30.509 --> 42:32.177
Where you are and who you are

42:32.219 --> 42:34.388
is not my concern.

42:35.806 --> 42:37.516
I surrender.

42:39.852 --> 42:41.687
So what does that mean to me?

42:43.021 --> 42:47.151
I want you to graciously
accept my apologies.

42:47.192 --> 42:50.070
Work alongside me,
but not too closely.

42:50.112 --> 42:52.823
Again, I don't understand.

42:52.865 --> 42:54.449
Yes, you do.

42:54.491 --> 42:56.493
I'm off-limits.

43:05.294 --> 43:08.463
And please, can you find a way

43:08.505 --> 43:11.258
to get your friend
out of my mother's life?

43:11.300 --> 43:13.468
You know she's demented.

43:13.510 --> 43:15.888
Manolo doesn't like women.

43:15.929 --> 43:17.723
Make sure.

43:46.168 --> 43:47.961
Sally.

43:48.003 --> 43:49.880
What?

43:52.591 --> 43:54.051
So you got what you wanted

43:54.092 --> 43:55.719
and now you think
you can be rude.

43:58.889 --> 44:01.433
Fine.

44:01.475 --> 44:04.019
I'm not going to tell you
what Mrs. Beresford said

44:04.019 --> 44:06.605
to me when you were
saying good-bye.

44:06.647 --> 44:08.816
She talked to you?

44:10.526 --> 44:12.903
She said you were
curious and bright

44:12.945 --> 44:15.697
and received glowing reports
from all concerned.

44:15.739 --> 44:17.533
But?

44:17.574 --> 44:20.410
She said a girl like you
coming from this family

44:20.452 --> 44:22.371
will have plenty of choices

44:22.412 --> 44:24.373
and she hopes you choose them.

44:24.414 --> 44:26.750
Oh.

44:29.461 --> 44:32.005
Now get me a cigarette
and give me some details.

44:42.724 --> 44:44.226
You want one, don't you?

44:48.772 --> 44:50.899
Go ahead.

44:50.899 --> 44:53.277
I'd rather have you do it in
front of me than behind my back.

45:00.159 --> 45:02.244
I'm sure your father
has given you a beer.

45:04.079 --> 45:06.707
My father has never
given me anything.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.885
Did you tell him
that I need to see him?

45:17.926 --> 45:20.804
- He went home.
- When?

45:20.846 --> 45:23.599
Right after I told him
you needed to see him.

45:30.147 --> 45:31.982
I know what you did,

45:32.024 --> 45:33.609
I just don't know
why you did it.

45:33.650 --> 45:35.110
Calm down.

45:35.110 --> 45:36.778
You want to offer me a drink?

45:36.820 --> 45:38.489
Pretend like you're
helping a little more?

45:38.530 --> 45:40.782
Close the door.

45:40.782 --> 45:42.493
Oh, of course.
You deserve privacy.

45:42.534 --> 45:45.454
Look, there's still enough money for the ad.
We'll make it work.

45:45.496 --> 45:47.623
Stop hiding behind the ad.

45:47.664 --> 45:49.416
I know what you did.

45:49.458 --> 45:52.085
I saved both of you.

45:52.127 --> 45:53.587
How do you think it looks?

45:53.629 --> 45:56.507
You hate that he is a good man.

45:56.548 --> 45:58.467
He's not that virtuous.

45:59.718 --> 46:01.428
He's just in love with you.

46:01.470 --> 46:03.805
Well, you killed him.

46:03.847 --> 46:05.557
You killed the ad.

46:05.599 --> 46:08.769
You killed everything.
You can stop now.

46:09.895 --> 46:12.648
I'm just looking out
for the agency.

46:14.358 --> 46:16.318
You're a monster.
