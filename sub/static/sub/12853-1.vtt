00:54.471 --> 00:58.647
I said, "Look, lady, the seats haven't
gotten smaller..."

00:58.809 --> 01:01.483
your ass has gotten bigger."

01:45.814 --> 01:49.535
I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is
restricted to first class.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.828
Are you looking for this?

01:53.697 --> 01:55.665
Can I get you anything?

01:55.991 --> 01:59.666
Scotch. Blended. Straight.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.376
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

02:05.709 --> 02:08.553
<i>We've got a report
of some turbulence ahead.</i>

02:08.878 --> 02:13.225
<i>Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts...</i>

02:13.550 --> 02:17.896
<i>and remain there until we release
the fasten-seat-belt sign.</i>

02:26.396 --> 02:28.899
I hear birds can't fly this high.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.361
I hear only angels can.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.747
Where's the bomb?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.038
I am the bomb.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.921
- Shall I pour your Scotch?
- No, I'll take the bottle.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.105
Another movie from an old TV show.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.104
What are you gonna do?

03:05.936 --> 03:07.279
Walk out.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.607
Very funny.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.609
No, it isn't.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.615
What are you doing?!

03:14.945 --> 03:17.448
What are you doing?! Get off of me!

03:43.098 --> 03:44.975
Help me! Help me!

03:48.520 --> 03:50.318
Help me! Be careful!

04:29.895 --> 04:31.488
Nice flight?

04:54.419 --> 04:55.966
You crazy bastard!

04:58.298 --> 05:00.801
I think you mean "crazy bitch."

05:06.139 --> 05:08.813
What is this?
What's going on here?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.149
Damn, I hate to fly.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.818
No way! No way!

05:14.147 --> 05:17.151
What's with that?!
Who are you people?!

05:17.484 --> 05:19.486
Who are you people?!

05:23.657 --> 05:28.163
<i>Once upon a time, there were three
very different little girls...</i>

05:55.689 --> 05:58.693
<i>who grew up to be
three very different women.</i>

05:59.025 --> 06:02.700
Making her a five-day champion.
Way to go, Natalie.

06:03.029 --> 06:07.034
<i>They have three things in common:
They're brilliant, beautiful...</i>

06:07.367 --> 06:09.369
I'm going to be all over you!

06:09.619 --> 06:11.963
You will be kissing my ass...

06:14.040 --> 06:16.213
<i>and they work for me.</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:18.716
<i>My name is Charlie.</i>

06:31.766 --> 06:33.564
- Let's go this way.
- No!

06:33.894 --> 06:34.895
This way!

06:35.562 --> 06:37.360
Wait. I'm not a yo-yo!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.606
Good morning, Starfish.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.278
Good morning, Chad.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.446
Sweet Chad.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.608
I figured we could have a little
breakfast.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.445
And then, maybe, after...

07:25.278 --> 07:27.622
we could have a little Chad.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.378
Hold that thought.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.632
Yes, I'll be right in.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.133
Isn't that just the luck?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.265
I can make something
besides eggs.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.018
No, it's not the eggs.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.648
Is it the boat?

07:53.974 --> 07:57.478
It's not the boat. I have to go.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.647
Is it the Chad?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.484
It might be the Chad.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.325
It's the Chad!

08:12.826 --> 08:14.499
It's the Chad!

08:17.622 --> 08:19.841
Eduardo, move me.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.081
Good morning.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.006
I signed the waiver, so feel free
to stick things in my slot.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.677
Thanks.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.092
No problem.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.683
Hey! I'll be right in.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.688
I want to get one thing straight
between us.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.693
Go ahead. We're past
keeping secrets at this point.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.860
This is going to be long...

10:11.027 --> 10:13.701
hard and rough.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.038
Sometimes when it's rough,
I just get there faster.

10:18.201 --> 10:22.707
If you don't defuse this bomb,
L.A. will be an underwater attraction.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.631
Which wire?
The red one or the blue one?

10:28.044 --> 10:30.217
That is not helping.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.723
My muffins.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.395
This is stupid, anyway.
Why wouldn't I just yank the wire?

10:36.553 --> 10:40.558
They're dummy wires, honey.
The real mechanism is inside.

10:40.723 --> 10:44.398
Trip the external feedback circuit,
the bomb will detonate.

10:48.398 --> 10:52.244
For a bikini waxer,
you know a lot about bombs.

10:56.072 --> 11:00.418
Isn't it amazing how much information
you can learn off the Internet?

11:08.835 --> 11:11.008
I'll be right there.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.343
When do I get to meet this Charlie?

11:16.593 --> 11:18.937
Charlie's not a very social person.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.270
But Charlie's a chick though, right?

11:23.933 --> 11:27.278
I mean, definitely a woman, right?

11:31.274 --> 11:34.118
I can't keep up this faÃ§ade
with Jason anymore.

11:34.277 --> 11:37.451
Who wants a man who's intimidated
by a strong woman?

11:37.614 --> 11:42.461
They come on nice until they find out
I can shatter a block with my head.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.954
I love that trick.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.793
Blueberry muffins.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.957
I made them from scratch.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.303
Yum.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.888
Sounds good.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.842
These look great, Alex.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.810
Oh, my God.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.567
What's this?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.482
Chinese fighting muffin.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.493
Nothing to laugh about.

12:15.735 --> 12:20.161
My buddy took a fighting muffin in the
chest, went home in four Ziploc bags.

12:20.490 --> 12:24.211
They're not Chinese.
They're not fighting. They're blueberry.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.830
Are you okay?

12:28.039 --> 12:30.588
She's having secret-identity trouble.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.880
Aren't we all?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.511
Scoot.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.508
Alex...

12:38.675 --> 12:40.518
all my Angels...

12:41.761 --> 12:44.184
the heart is a muscle.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.064
In bodybuilding,
we exercise the muscle...

12:48.226 --> 12:50.945
and it grows bigger and stronger.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.277
It's the same with the heart.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.233
I must have the heart of a rhino.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.903
You do. Be proud of it.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.370
<i>Mes Anges...</i>

13:02.699 --> 13:04.417
these little hurts will heal.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.881
And at crunch time,
your hearts will be so buff...

13:10.039 --> 13:13.213
you'll be able to clean
and jerk his love...

13:13.376 --> 13:16.050
three sets, 10 reps each.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.930
Thanks, Bos.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.890
Excuse me.
I have to take a phone call.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.734
<i>Good morning, Angels.</i>

13:30.059 --> 13:31.481
Good morning, Charlie.

13:31.644 --> 13:36.070
<i>Dylan, Alex, Natalie, I hope you're
ready for your next assignment.</i>

13:37.400 --> 13:42.622
<i>Meet Eric Knox, a brilliant engineer
and founder of Knox Technologies...</i>

13:42.780 --> 13:46.250
<i>an up-and-coming communications
software company.</i>

13:46.409 --> 13:48.582
<i>Last night, Knox was kidnapped...</i>

13:48.828 --> 13:51.798
<i>and his voice-identification
software was stolen.</i>

13:55.752 --> 13:57.254
Who's the lady?

13:57.420 --> 14:00.845
<i>Vivian Wood,
president of Knox Technologies.</i>

14:01.007 --> 14:02.509
Oh, she did it.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.766
I guess we can all go home then.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.432
Angels, meet Vivian Wood,
our new client.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.436
She's hired us to find Eric Knox.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.694
Hello.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.448
Who'd have the most to gain
from Knox's disappearance?

14:17.607 --> 14:19.860
Me, probably. I'm his partner.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.445
Before we were partners...

14:23.279 --> 14:25.281
we were friends.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.621
Does Knox have any enemies?

14:27.784 --> 14:29.786
<i>Roger Corwin. He's owner...</i>

14:30.036 --> 14:34.633
<i>of Red Star, the largest
communications satellite firm.</i>

14:34.874 --> 14:37.718
Six months ago,
he tried to buy Knox Technologies.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.804
When Knox refused to sell,
Corwin lost it.

14:40.963 --> 14:41.964
Charming.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.633
Was there a ransom demand?

14:43.883 --> 14:47.513
Nothing. But I know he's still alive.

14:47.678 --> 14:50.978
I'll study the garage footage.
Something may be there.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.145
So Corwin is our only lead.
Hopefully, he'll take us to Knox.

14:55.478 --> 15:00.154
<i>Corwin gets a weekly massage at
Madame Wong's House of Blossoms.</i>

15:00.316 --> 15:03.490
<i>That's our chance to feel him out.</i>

15:03.986 --> 15:05.738
He said what?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.658
"Over my dead body"?

15:09.659 --> 15:12.003
I can accept those terms.

15:13.496 --> 15:18.502
It's getting a little chilly in here, Yoko.
I could use some warming up.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.677
At your service.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.012
Good.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.512
Could we get started
this millennium?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.353
Banzai!

15:38.146 --> 15:39.864
Yeah.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.116
You're holding a lot of tension...

15:42.358 --> 15:44.360
in your 4th and 5th vertebrae.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.611
I know.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.536
Let me see if I can work that...

15:50.533 --> 15:51.876
out.

15:54.203 --> 15:59.209
By activating the right energy points,
you can increase circulation...

16:01.169 --> 16:03.388
alleviate pain...

16:03.546 --> 16:05.389
or even...

16:07.717 --> 16:09.719
render a man unconscious.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.409
Okay, let's go.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.418
Palm Pilot.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.961
Got the car key.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.094
I got his schedule.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.102
You must have dozed off.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.443
You're very good...

17:03.022 --> 17:04.944
with your hands.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.618
I could use someone like you
on my staff.

17:09.111 --> 17:14.117
Thanks for the offer, but my hands
aren't going anywhere near your staff.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.297
If Corwin is behind Knox's
disappearance...

17:23.459 --> 17:26.383
someone else
is doing his dirty work.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.478
How's it coming
with the kidnapping footage?

17:37.640 --> 17:40.644
I'm enhancing a reflection
from the car window.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.824
<i>May I take your order?</i>

17:46.983 --> 17:51.363
Three cheeseburgers, three
French fries and three cherry pies.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.906
What do you guys want?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.418
Here's one of the kidnappers.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.503
Creepy Thin Man.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.505
Now we just look for him.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.416
And see if he works for Corwin.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.009
What's Corwin doing tonight?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.003
Who's up for crashing a party?

18:30.401 --> 18:31.527
Bos.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.038
- Thanks, Nat.
- No problem.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.871
It's a mic-transmitter.
Put it on your back molar.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.082
I know. It's a mouth-mic.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.372
We'll be able to always
stay in touch.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.049
We're in deep cover now, so if...

18:52.214 --> 18:57.061
you can't remember John David,
just call me J.D. Think of...

18:57.303 --> 19:00.227
- Jelly doughnut.
- Jack Daniel's.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.063
- Juvenile delinquents.
- John DeLorean.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.993
There's your date, J.D.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.404
Excuse me, ladies.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.918
Roger Corwin. Welcome.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.751
John David Rage, self-help guru.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.174
<i>John David Rage?</i>

19:26.332 --> 19:28.585
<i>Relax, Bos. Order a drink.</i>

19:29.585 --> 19:31.258
Excuse me. Miss?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.510
- Hi.
- Hi, miss.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.801
<i>- A hammerhead, please.
- No problem.</i>

19:37.677 --> 19:39.679
Any creepy thin men?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.973
Lots of creepy, none thin.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.937
- I was wondering if...
- No.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.019
- So there's no chance...
- No.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.113
That's incredible.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.622
What is?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.374
Your smile.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.293
Thanks.

20:05.162 --> 20:09.167
This place, it's Japanese, is it not?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.506
It's a 13th-century Shinto temple.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.763
I had it...

20:14.505 --> 20:17.008
I had it FedEx'd from Kyoto.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.684
Blowfish?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.269
Isn't that poisonous?

20:20.511 --> 20:25.517
It's a rare delicacy for the man who
has no fear of an excruciating death.

20:27.518 --> 20:30.192
Technically, 1 in 60 is fatal.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.032
Tastes like chicken.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.211
That would go
very nicely with broccoli.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.381
The man laughs at death.

20:49.540 --> 20:53.215
Good work, Bos.
Get him to talk about Knox.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.389
At last, a worthy adversary.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.602
Let's see if you can survive
a test of intuition and judgment.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.773
Nat, that bartender is cute.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.312
I'm working.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.524
He likes you.
Go back and flirt a little.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.368
That was fast.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.291
I'm not called Balls-Out Natalie
for nothing.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.044
Right.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.880
I never saw you working here before.

21:30.039 --> 21:33.794
I'm new. I'm like a virgin.
I mean, it's my first time...

21:35.127 --> 21:37.300
here at Corwin's.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.888
Oh, boy. She's going down.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.060
No way. He's into her.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.229
<i>Just pick up the tray
and walk away.</i>

21:46.722 --> 21:49.566
No, no. Stay. Stay and talk to him.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.820
- Flip your hair.
- What?

21:52.978 --> 21:56.073
Flip your goddamn hair.

22:10.079 --> 22:14.084
Excuse me. I don't usually do this,
but I was wondering...

22:14.250 --> 22:17.094
Unless you're already
seeing someone else.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.301
- Yeah.
- Of course you are.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.465
No! I'm not seeing anyone.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.852
Free.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.935
Okay, Thursday?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.182
My favorite day.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.272
Great. I'll get tickets.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.610
I love tickets.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.531
What do you know?
A guy who speaks Natalie.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.857
Where's J.D.?

23:09.805 --> 23:11.807
Will somebody help me up, please?

23:12.016 --> 23:14.485
Hello, girls? Are you hearing me?

23:22.818 --> 23:24.161
Thin Man, 10 o'clock.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.530
Why do they always run?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.401
Watch it!

24:52.741 --> 24:53.742
Nat!

25:04.461 --> 25:06.463
- Brace!
- Jump!

27:00.244 --> 27:01.871
Check them all!

27:08.710 --> 27:09.882
- Clear!
- Clear!

27:10.087 --> 27:11.555
Clear!

27:39.074 --> 27:40.075
Knox.

27:42.578 --> 27:45.752
<i>Great work, Angels,
but our job's only half-finished.</i>

27:45.914 --> 27:49.293
<i>There's still the matter
of Mr. Knox's stolen technology.</i>

27:50.127 --> 27:52.471
What's so special
about your software?

27:53.589 --> 27:57.093
It's... It's really quite amazing.

27:57.259 --> 28:01.605
We developed a program.
You see, everyone's voice is unique.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.603
It has a unique signature...

28:03.932 --> 28:07.778
like a snowflake.
And it can be mapped...

28:08.103 --> 28:13.451
Audio DNA. It makes it impossible to
disguise or scramble a voice signal.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.657
<i>Which is why Corwin wants it.</i>

28:15.819 --> 28:20.620
Of course. All Red Star's satellites
have global positioning systems.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.619
Combine that
with voice identification...

28:23.785 --> 28:26.629
Any cell phone could be
a homing device.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.165
No one could hide.

28:28.457 --> 28:31.961
Imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.295
The end of privacy.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.510
<i>That's where you come in, Angels.</i>

28:35.756 --> 28:39.477
<i>Corwin is premiering his Red Star
racer at the California Speedway.</i>

28:39.635 --> 28:42.764
Our chance to plant
a hidden camera on Corwin.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.353
<i>Looks like it's off to the races,
Angels.</i>

28:45.933 --> 28:50.109
When Roger Corwin first got
involved in the world of racing...

28:50.270 --> 28:54.946
a lot of people said it was
a stopgap for my waning libido.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.444
I had them all fired.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.742
What's so funny? I did.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.125
Thanks for coming
to this little test run.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.552
Nat...

29:18.674 --> 29:19.675
I'm going in.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.016
But what can I say?

29:23.178 --> 29:25.476
It's a Red Star day for me.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.730
Then it's back
to the day-to-day grind...

29:29.893 --> 29:33.147
of world domination
and enslavement.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.785
Hi.

29:50.372 --> 29:51.874
Work your magic.

29:56.837 --> 29:59.386
It's hot out there.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.178
It's hot in here too.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.141
Maybe I can make you
more comfortable.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.486
I've come undone.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.241
That feels good.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.580
Thank you.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.885
I like what you've done with it.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.173
Ours has bigger mirrors.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.061
I love cars.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.768
Do you like fast cars?

30:57.731 --> 31:00.075
I like fast everything.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.237
Oh, my God.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.292
Thanks for the ride.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.919
You're welcome.

31:17.959 --> 31:22.385
Mission accomplished. Tomorrow,
Corwin will give us a tour of Red Star.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.767
Ride 'em, cowboy. Make me proud.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.342
Nat!

32:08.635 --> 32:09.852
<i>What's going on?</i>

32:10.011 --> 32:11.888
We got a friend on the track.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.682
<i>That creep from Chinatown.</i>

32:13.849 --> 32:14.850
Creepy Thin Man.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.873
It's a round track.
He's not going anywhere.

32:54.264 --> 32:55.937
She's going after him.

34:22.726 --> 34:26.982
<i>The microcamera has allowed us
to study Red Star's layout.</i>

34:27.148 --> 34:30.152
The mainframe is right behind
that door.

34:30.318 --> 34:34.494
That's where my software would be,
but the security looks incredible.

34:35.156 --> 34:36.829
- Restricted access.
- Fingerprint ID.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.039
Retinal scanner.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.666
<i>Angels, break it down.</i>

34:40.829 --> 34:43.833
Only two Red Star directors
can access the mainframe.

34:43.998 --> 34:48.049
To gain access, they have
to synchronize their entrance.

34:50.672 --> 34:54.176
A gelatin scanning plate
takes exact fingerprints.

34:54.676 --> 34:58.351
A laser accurate to .009 millimeters
scans the retina.

35:02.517 --> 35:07.523
It is accessible only through
a monitored airless antechamber.

35:09.983 --> 35:14.864
There's only one way to get through
undetected: Be invisible.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.379
The floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity.

35:22.579 --> 35:26.083
Any contact exceeding .25 seconds
triggers the alarm.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.095
Sounds impossible.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.719
Sounds like fun.

36:44.285 --> 36:47.539
<i>Mein Siegenbock ist sexy!</i>

36:52.460 --> 36:54.462
They got the wrong address.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.674
You ready to whip them
into shape, Alex?

37:47.849 --> 37:50.352
You must be Miss Aarons. I'm Doris.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.063
Sorry about the confusion.

37:53.229 --> 37:57.279
I had you scheduled for next week.
I don't know what happened.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.119
That's what I'm here to find out.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.451
You are the efficiency expert.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.040
Yes.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.042
I am.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.119
Bitch.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.379
I heard that.

38:18.713 --> 38:22.559
Your methodologies are antiquated
and weak.

38:22.884 --> 38:27.264
Your procedures of approval ensure
that only the least radical ideas...

38:28.056 --> 38:29.399
are rewarded.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.978
Meanwhile, your competition
is innovating!

38:40.068 --> 38:41.240
You.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.160
What was the last suggestion
you made?

38:46.783 --> 38:48.751
To make the Coke machine free.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.085
Why?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.459
Caffeine helps us program.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.003
Perfect. Smart...

38:58.586 --> 39:01.260
simple and logical.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.346
What did your boss say?

39:06.094 --> 39:07.767
He said no.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.940
Question!

39:11.349 --> 39:13.272
Who builds
this company's products?

39:14.602 --> 39:15.945
You do.

39:18.106 --> 39:20.108
Engineers do.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.611
Not managers.

39:24.946 --> 39:29.292
They should be answering to you,
not you to them!

39:30.451 --> 39:33.796
Who else has an idea
like this man's Coke machine?

39:34.289 --> 39:36.542
All right! Tell me.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.630
Better yet...

39:39.460 --> 39:41.963
can anyone show me?

40:34.641 --> 40:35.688
It's not working.

41:08.841 --> 41:13.563
<i>There's only one way to get through
undetected: Be invisible.</i>

41:28.569 --> 41:31.038
<i>The floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity.</i>

41:31.239 --> 41:35.369
<i>Any contact which exceeds
.25 seconds will trigger the alarm.</i>

41:57.432 --> 41:58.775
Thank you, sir.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.952
I hope you don't mind
if we look around.

42:43.644 --> 42:46.818
So we have complete access
to Red Star's computer.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.780
And they have no idea
we can peek inside.

42:49.942 --> 42:52.161
You guys are tremendous. Thanks.

42:53.654 --> 42:58.501
I need evidence of Knox Technologies
software in the Red Star system.

42:58.785 --> 43:02.210
- Where is it?
- Bosley has it in the laptop.

43:02.371 --> 43:05.466
It has a direct link
to the Red Star mainframe.

43:05.625 --> 43:06.672
Bosley?

43:07.835 --> 43:11.009
Maybe we should be doing
our own analysis.

43:11.172 --> 43:14.346
Surely Eric would be
the best person to...

43:14.675 --> 43:18.555
Our goal was to learn if Red Star
had stolen your software.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.975
It would be unethical
to let you access their systems.

43:22.183 --> 43:24.185
If we get proof, we'll tell you.

43:24.477 --> 43:27.151
That makes sense.
That's cool. Right?

43:27.688 --> 43:29.235
Right, Viv?

43:30.858 --> 43:33.737
You know, Knox may not be
out of danger yet.

43:33.986 --> 43:35.909
Smile. Don't panic the client.

43:36.155 --> 43:40.331
One of us should check
security at his house.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.378
Absolutely. I agree.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.215
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Nothing up here.

43:54.549 --> 43:57.223
Wow, that was cool.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.221
Who's the Green Beret?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.227
My dad.

44:02.557 --> 44:03.900
That's nice.

44:07.061 --> 44:08.734
That's the guy who killed him.

44:12.567 --> 44:16.242
Yeah. They were
in Army Intelligence together.

44:16.529 --> 44:19.248
This was his best friend
and he turned on him.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.581
I'm sorry.

44:22.743 --> 44:23.915
Thanks.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.372
<i>Why do you keep it?</i>

44:26.581 --> 44:31.587
To remind me: Be careful who you
trust. Don't take any wooden nickels.

44:32.420 --> 44:35.424
What about you?
Did you ever have parents?

44:35.756 --> 44:38.760
I mean... I know you have parents,
but I mean...

44:39.260 --> 44:40.762
Where's your mom?

44:41.596 --> 44:44.725
She died when I was 6,
and I never met my father.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.270
You never met your father?

44:50.271 --> 44:51.739
Now you work for...

44:53.441 --> 44:55.944
a man you've never seen.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.947
That's an interesting trend.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.457
That was smooth.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.625
Want to play Scrabble?

45:04.452 --> 45:07.126
Don't worry about it.
I got somebody...

45:07.455 --> 45:09.128
That's okay.

45:09.457 --> 45:11.630
What are they called? You know...

45:19.634 --> 45:21.807
So, okay.

45:23.471 --> 45:25.314
- This is a panic button.
- Okay.

45:27.141 --> 45:30.645
If you just press it,
then any one of us...

45:30.937 --> 45:34.658
whoever's closest,
will be here if there's any problem.

45:34.941 --> 45:38.286
Like that? Okay.
Right now, that would be you.

45:38.486 --> 45:40.488
But you don't have a problem.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.494
Yeah, I do.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.503
I don't know...

45:48.663 --> 45:50.506
how to make chicken.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.502
Scrabble?

45:54.961 --> 45:56.133
Shake 'N Bake?

45:56.337 --> 45:58.010
I'll shake, you bake?

46:12.853 --> 46:14.526
I want to shake.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.199
- Hey, Pete.
- How's it going?

46:20.486 --> 46:24.161
- Good. How are you?
- Good. It's good to see you.

46:24.532 --> 46:27.035
- You want your ticket?
- All right!

46:29.370 --> 46:32.544
- Thanks for giving me a chance.
- I wanted to see you.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.209
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.548
- You look great.
- Thank you.

46:37.837 --> 46:39.680
I've thought a lot about us.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.259
No, no, no.
I know you have something to say...

46:43.426 --> 46:45.849
but I have something to say too.

46:46.053 --> 46:49.899
I've been thinking a lot about you
and me and, well, us.

46:50.224 --> 46:54.730
And I know that we have these crazy
lives, but I can't help it.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.902
I love you.

Yeah, she'll go.

Definitely. Definitely.

49:55.451 --> 49:57.419
All right. The Robot!

49:57.745 --> 50:01.090
Go, white girl! Go, white girl!

50:01.540 --> 50:05.044
That's old school, right? Definitely.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.381
I'm Pete. How are you?

50:13.761 --> 50:15.229
The Running Man! Look!

50:23.938 --> 50:26.111
Incredible! It was great!

50:26.398 --> 50:29.402
I'm having so much fun!
This is so exciting!

50:29.610 --> 50:31.738
You know, I have to go number one.

50:35.908 --> 50:36.955
Look...

50:38.452 --> 50:40.454
what I'm trying to say is...

50:42.790 --> 50:44.463
will you marry me?

50:47.294 --> 50:49.467
Oh, no, baby! Baby?!

50:50.297 --> 50:52.641
Baby?! God, no.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.640
Damn you, Salazar.

50:55.970 --> 50:58.814
Damn you, Salazar!

50:59.473 --> 51:00.816
Cut!

51:01.100 --> 51:03.478
Was that over the top?
It felt over the top.

51:03.811 --> 51:08.066
No. That is the best shot, the best
scene, the best movie on the planet!

51:18.659 --> 51:19.831
Hi.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.755
How was your day? Great.

51:23.497 --> 51:28.173
You know how superheroes have
these secret identities, where they...

51:28.669 --> 51:30.421
No. No superheroes.

51:33.507 --> 51:37.182
You're an action star.
I get a lot of action.

51:38.512 --> 51:40.685
That is so lame.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.272
Hey, girls, you having fun?

51:43.517 --> 51:45.519
I'm having so much fun
I could just die.

51:45.853 --> 51:49.448
Jason, I'm one-third of an elite
crime-fighting team...

51:49.607 --> 51:51.780
backed by
an anonymous millionaire.

51:53.193 --> 51:55.195
Yes, that's it.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.218
What are you doing here?

52:19.470 --> 52:20.562
Perfect.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.685
Come on! Go! Hit it!

53:10.938 --> 53:12.781
Murphy O'Meyer...

53:13.607 --> 53:14.950
that does it.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.535
Who sent you?

53:18.612 --> 53:19.784
Who?!

53:22.783 --> 53:24.626
Woo... Woo...

53:24.785 --> 53:26.458
- Who?
- Woo...

53:29.123 --> 53:31.546
- Vivian...
- Spit it out!

53:32.126 --> 53:33.173
Vivian Wood!

53:36.630 --> 53:38.132
You bitch.

53:44.304 --> 53:45.977
I love a fire.

54:11.290 --> 54:12.291
Hey.

54:13.333 --> 54:15.006
Oh, my God! You're hit!

54:15.335 --> 54:19.431
No. I mean, the squibs hurt a bit
when they go off, but I'm fine.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.346
What happened to my trailer?

54:22.009 --> 54:23.682
I haven't been honest with you.

54:23.927 --> 54:27.101
Were you in there when
that happened? Look at it.

54:27.347 --> 54:28.940
I'm not a bikini waxer.

54:32.186 --> 54:36.692
Bummer. I mean, that was
kind of a turn-on.

54:45.949 --> 54:47.121
I have to go.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.207
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

54:50.037 --> 54:52.881
I have to go,
but will you call me tomorrow?

54:53.123 --> 54:55.376
- Of course.
- Great. Thanks.

55:01.340 --> 55:02.432
Excuse me.

55:05.219 --> 55:06.892
You're bad.

55:09.890 --> 55:12.939
Guys, finally you warm up a bit.

55:13.894 --> 55:18.400
Dylan? It's Nat. Vivian Wood
is a fake and an all-around bitch.

55:18.565 --> 55:21.944
Her assassin just paid me a visit.
We gotta warn Knox.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.245
I'm at his house now.

55:24.404 --> 55:25.747
You are?

55:26.657 --> 55:28.000
You know what?

55:28.242 --> 55:30.745
<i>Call Alex and meet me
at the agency.</i>

55:33.747 --> 55:35.920
Dylan! Shit.

55:42.589 --> 55:45.593
Don't stand next to the window,
it's not safe.

55:46.260 --> 55:47.603
Toga.

55:51.765 --> 55:55.110
Listen, I just found out that...
Who's that?

55:57.104 --> 55:58.777
Working undercover?

55:59.273 --> 56:02.117
It's a full-service job.

56:03.443 --> 56:04.786
I'll bet.

56:05.279 --> 56:08.624
I can see by your gown
that you're unarmed.

56:08.949 --> 56:12.624
Some maniac could just stroll in
and blow you both to bits.

56:12.870 --> 56:17.797
Viv, you're obsessed. All work
and no play makes Viv a dull girl.

56:18.125 --> 56:21.629
I have to tie up some loose ends here,
so take a seat.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.298
Want some champagne?

56:31.138 --> 56:32.560
"Enemy."

56:37.144 --> 56:38.487
I know.

56:48.155 --> 56:49.998
Sad news.

56:50.324 --> 56:51.997
Your girlfriends are dead.

56:52.326 --> 56:53.669
And Corwin?

57:16.600 --> 57:19.444
I don't think it's gonna work out,
you and me.

57:19.686 --> 57:22.860
Which is a real bummer,
since you, Dylan...

57:23.190 --> 57:26.034
are a tomcat in the sack.

57:28.362 --> 57:32.959
Let me get this straight. You're a
woman. Women have natural intuition.

57:33.116 --> 57:37.963
And you're a detective. And you had
no idea that this was going to happen?

57:38.872 --> 57:41.045
- I knew.
- She knew.

57:41.208 --> 57:43.131
And I know what'll happen next.

57:43.293 --> 57:44.636
Tell her, baby.

57:46.880 --> 57:50.054
All the Angels are going to heaven.

57:50.384 --> 57:51.556
And Bosley?

57:51.802 --> 57:54.646
We'll keep him. We like him.
And his computer.

57:54.805 --> 57:56.148
He's special.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.478
Corwin had nothing to do with this.

58:01.728 --> 58:04.732
No. But I never really liked him.

58:05.065 --> 58:07.989
- And the kidnapping was a setup.
- Afraid so.

58:08.235 --> 58:09.737
And Red Star was a setup.

58:09.987 --> 58:13.582
You got it all figured out.
Any other questions?

58:13.907 --> 58:14.908
Why?

58:17.244 --> 58:18.587
Ask your boss.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.089
Charlie?

58:22.916 --> 58:24.168
You're after Charlie.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.930
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

58:30.424 --> 58:33.143
They say that in death...

58:33.301 --> 58:36.100
all life's questions are answered.

58:37.264 --> 58:38.857
Will you let me know?

58:46.189 --> 58:47.862
Let's go get Charlie.

58:52.779 --> 58:53.951
Come on.

59:06.877 --> 59:07.878
Are you all right?

59:08.045 --> 59:09.968
- What's going on?
- Something's going on.

59:10.130 --> 59:11.302
Where's Dylan?

59:24.144 --> 59:29.196
They say in death,
all life's questions are answered.

59:30.817 --> 59:32.364
Will you let me know?

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.861
What are we doing?
House of Pancakes? Sizzler?

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.861
You are the cheapest man
on the planet.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.205
What did it look like?

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:30.215
Oh, I don't know. It was, like,
all cool and stuff.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.463
You've never seen a booby.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.972
- Have too.
- Have not.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.558
- I've seen lots of boobies.
- Yeah, right.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.896
A little help?

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.325
Don't ask.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.573
Where's Knox? Is he okay?

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:02.409
Oh, he's great. He's the bad guy.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.581
The kidnapping was a setup.
He's behind it all.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.503
What? Why?

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:12.753
He wasn't exactly forthcoming
when he shot me out the window.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.519
Bosley!

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.609
He's safe! Knox already has him.

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:32.781
Wait a minute.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.359
Let me get this straight.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.953
Bosley's with the man...

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.872
who tried to kill us. That's safe?

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:44.288
He won't kill Bosley
until he kills Charlie.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.620
Kills Charlie?

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.465
Oh, Jesus.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:55.466
I don't know what his plan is,
but I know that we can stop him.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:08.358
If Knox thinks we're dead,
why blow up the agency?

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:09.733
Why does he want Charlie?

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.817
We do know that he wanted us
to break into Red Star.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:17.492
Imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:21.910
<i>Knox used us to access the mainframe
not to get back his software...</i>

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.829
<i>but for control of their global
positioning satellites.</i>

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.921
Knox's software can match Charlie's
voice over the phone.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.915
And use Red Star satellites
to track him.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:35.586
But why would Knox go to so much
trouble to find Charlie?

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.672
That's the guy who killed him.

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.676
They were in Army Intelligence
together.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.769
His best friend turned on him.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.940
Knox thinks Charlie killed his father.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.352
So if he can intercept
Charlie's call...

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:54.188
He can locate him.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.611
But Knox has to get Charlie
on the phone first.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:02.283
- But the only one Charlie calls is...
- Bosley.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:31.726
May I have some ice water, please?

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:56.921
Fly to me, Angels! Please come!

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.594
Please fly to me, Angels!

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:04.432
I had a long talk with a squirrel once.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.802
Longer than I've talked
to most humans.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:31.626
Hello?

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.129
Hello?

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.632
Hello. Hello out there.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:39.550
Any sign of Bosley's laptop?

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:41.215
They must have taken it.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.964
- We should check Knox's place.
- Let's go.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.215
I'll drive.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.638
<i>Angels?! Angels, help me!</i>

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:48.968
Bosley?

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.724
<i>Angels!</i>

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:55.142
We begin our broadcast day!
Come and get me, girls!

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:59.988
<i>If you can follow the sound
of my voice, then draw some...</i>

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.735
<i>triangles or something...</i>

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.992
<i>to get to this
location and save me!</i>

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.488
Is there a way to trace him?

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.749
Even with our equipment,
he'd have to be within 20 miles.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:14.164
The place I'm in looks like
Cher's bedroom.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.329
And it stinks.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:20.007
Tell us where you are.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.009
<i>It smells like the ocean.</i>

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:25.513
And if I look out the window,
I see the ocean.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:28.258
He could be anywhere
this half of North America.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.010
Jack...

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.678
tell them where I am.

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:35.682
What?

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.940
It's a Sitta pygmaea!

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:42.197
A pygmy nuthatch!

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.866
They only live in one place!

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:46.572
Carmel!

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.034
"I can't tell you anything else,
except"

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:53.871
this feels like the first day
of the last of my life.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.125
Or the last day of the first
of my life, or something.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:03.380
I have a lighthouse, two hotels,
seven manor houses...

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:08.549
one owned by the National Parks,
one by Nick Xero Corporation...

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.056
- Is that spelled with an "X" or a "Z"?
- "X."

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:13.386
It's an anagram.

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:16.264
Rearranged, it's "Eric Knox."

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.059
Scrabble freak.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.732
An old tunnel leads down
to the shore.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:26.241
A sea approach is the best way to get
in undetected. We'll need a boat.

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:28.902
And a cover.
We can't use the speedboat.

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:34.915
Head to the marina.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:32.386
Chad, does this thing go any faster?

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:36.307
We're in a hurry, and I could
open it up if you let me drive.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:41.642
I'm sorry, friend of Starfish. There's
only one captain of this love boat.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.318
That captain is me...

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.404
the Chad.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.156
The Chad.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.984
Chad, captain of the love boat.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:52.569
The Chad.

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:54.412
We're kind of in a hurry.

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.491
I'm the Chad.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:14.596
<i>Knox Technologies voice identification
software download confirmed.</i>

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:30.524
<i>Red Star satellite network uplink
confirmed.</i>

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.370
Revenge is fun.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.709
I have to say, Starfish,
I am honored...

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:49.627
that you've taken an interest in my
work. And I think you're very pretty.

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:51.386
Starfish?

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.546
Where are you going?

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:58.260
Starfish, are you going swimming?
Where are you going?

01:08:58.426 --> 01:08:59.803
Where are you going again?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.479
Starfish?

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.058
Was it the Chad?

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.899
No! The Chad was great!

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.531
The Chad was great.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.829
I'll tap the signal from the roof.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.533
<i>- I'll</i> deal with Knox.
<i>- I'll</i> bring our Bosley back.

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:28.149
"I don't know how to make chicken."

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.692
Jerk.

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.012
Dylan.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.856
Thank God you're alive.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:12.436
You know my better half.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:17.483
It figures I'd meet the perfect guy
and he'd already have a perfect girl.

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.437
Hello, blondie.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.223
Her girlfriend's here.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.606
Jimmy, Paulie, go secure Bosley,
would you?

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:57.613
Like now, now, now, now.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:04.116
Bos?

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.952
- Bosley?
- Natalie?

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.162
Natalie, is that you?

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.293
Behind this door.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:15.586
Bosley, I'm so happy to see you!

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:18.843
We're all here. I'll get you out.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.643
Red wire.

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:29.645
Blue wire.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.775
GPS phone tap.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:39.321
Pygmy nuthatch.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:44.785
- I'm getting tickled.
- Who's calling now?

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.662
- It's Pete!
- Pete?

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:48.164
Hello?

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:50.662
Hi, Pete. How are you?

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:53.294
Good. You said
you wanted me to call.

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:56.376
I did want you to call.
I mean, I do want you to.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.166
Ask if he can call you back.

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:00.342
I'm so happy to hear from you.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:04.005
I wanted to talk.
I like spending time with you.

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:07.675
I'd like to see more of you,
maybe in a continuous block.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:11.642
I know. It's just been crazy
this week at work.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.189
Watch your back!

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.523
Use the sleeper.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:25.493
Never send a man
to do a woman's job.

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:31.039
- Nice work, Natalie.
- Thanks, Bosley.

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:34.243
Pete? Hi.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:38.547
You know, under different
circumstances...

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:41.004
we'd have made a great couple.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:45.679
If you hadn't shot me out a window
and tried to kill everyone I love...

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.553
we could have had a chance.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.180
Can you keep a secret?

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:53.721
I mean, you can't tell anyone.

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:55.686
That you're disgusting?

01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:01.813
You have the fullest, sweetest...

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.862
most luscious...

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.902
lips I have ever...

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:10.079
kissed.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:15.577
I just gotta take this call.

01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:23.091
Nine o'clock, Charlie. Right on time.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.598
Enter. Come on.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:39.601
Mr. Bosley's phone,
Eric Knox speaking.

01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:42.270
<i>Mr. Knox?
This is Charles Townsend.</i>

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:51.742
<i>I'm delighted the Angels helped you.
Are you in the office?</i>

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.585
Hang up, Charlie.
He's almost got you.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:01.293
We're all at the beach,
having mimosas. Can you join us?

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:05.505
I'll take a rain check, Eric.
Is Bosley there?

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:08.421
He went to the men's room.
He'll be right back.

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:11.974
No, wait. He's coming.

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.093
Bosley?

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.983
Okay, here we go.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:35.157
That's not him. Sorry.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:37.621
Can you hold on one second longer?

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.285
<i>Not a problem.</i>

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:44.123
Pete? Can you hold on a second?

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:45.465
Sure.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.006
I like him so much.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.221
Hey, Bos.

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:02.604
Bosley?

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:05.444
He's coming, sir.

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:33.635
Sorry, not him.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:36.384
Can I take a message?

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:39.019
<i>Just tell him I called, as planned.</i>

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:47.486
Gotcha.

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:14.471
Just one more sec.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.598
Is this a bad time?

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:19.803
You seem a little distracted.

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.189
Is this the famous Charlie?

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:29.191
No, this is Pete.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.983
Hey! I like that guy!

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.749
That man's got a beautiful
telephone voice.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:52.005
That's one more daddy
you'll never know.

01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:56.926
Bad news.

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:59.182
I have to leave.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:02.929
I gotta go torture and kill your boss.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.766
Mikey, Jerry...

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:09.105
you guys like angel cake?

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:23.616
Do you know how hard it is to find
a quality man in Los Angeles?

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.819
Don't take my lighter.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.837
Wait, wait, wait!
I have something to tell you.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.082
By the time this is over...

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:16.589
all of you will be facedown
on the floor...

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.846
and I'll moon-walk out of here.

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.179
You're not listening to me.

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:26.012
First, you're going to help me
out of my chair.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:29.061
Then I'll leapfrog over you...

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.522
before I break his nose.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.446
Since my trusty lighter...

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:39.864
isn't working, I'll do all this
with my hands tied behind my back.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:42.619
Get her!

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.047
King Kong palm.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.727
Buddha on lotus.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:35.255
And that's kicking your ass.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.355
Alex!

01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:30.261
Thanks, Bos!

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.289
Come on, we'll miss happy hour.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:42.083
He's heading north,
just past Paradise Cove!

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:45.844
Oh, boy, they found him.
That's Charlie's cabin.

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:51.676
- You've seen it?
- You've seen Charlie?

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:53.685
I am his trusted friend
and employee.

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:55.221
You've met Charlie?

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:57.018
What do you mean, "met"?

01:22:57.264 --> 01:22:59.938
You've seen him with your own eyes.

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.937
I saw his hand.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:05.693
It could have been anyone's hand.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.920
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:34.904
Sorry, Charlie.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:23.749
Get Dylan!
The missile's making a round trip!

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:39.093
Dylan!

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:52.439
Let's go!

01:26:48.245 --> 01:26:49.462
Charlie.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.516
You GUYS...

01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:07.180
we're finally meeting Charlie.

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.858
Do I look okay?

01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:15.689
Should we knock?

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:32.380
Charlie?

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:47.562
<i>Good morning, Angels.</i>

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:57.731
<i>Sorry I couldn't stick around.</i>

01:27:59.065 --> 01:28:02.069
We're so happy you're okay,
Charlie.

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:06.911
<i>I'm just fine, Angels.
Mission accomplished?</i>

01:28:09.242 --> 01:28:11.916
I think the client was blown away.

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:18.920
<i>Eric Knox was born John McCadden.</i>

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:22.009
<i>It seems his life's mission
was to bring me down.</i>

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:27.053
<i>His dad was in my Army Intelligence
unit, working as a double agent.</i>

01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:30.518
<i>When he was discovered,
the other side killed him.</i>

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:33.893
I guess that's not
the story Knox heard.

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:39.774
Charlie, I've really enjoyed
working on this assignment...

01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:44.115
and I eagerly anticipate
returning to work.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:47.117
Bosley's had
one too many Buddhas.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.374
He's definitely had a few.

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:52.039
<i>I have a team rebuilding the office.</i>

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:54.959
<i>It'll be better than new
when you get back.</i>

01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:57.290
Thank you, Charlie.

01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:01.337
Is there any chance
you'll be joining us, Charlie?

01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:05.302
I'd love to, Angels.

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:11.146
But I have some precious treasures
to watch over.

01:29:11.972 --> 01:29:13.974
Come on, Charlie, it'll be fun.

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:16.898
We're drinking from coconuts
and Buddhas.

01:29:19.145 --> 01:29:21.989
How will we ever know
you truly exist...

01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:24.826
unless you come
have a coconut with us?

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:30.165
<i>Faith, Angels. It's called faith.</i>

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:41.628
- To Charlie.
- To Charlie.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:48.301
Let me toast you ladies,
with some ice cubes!

01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:06.712
Safe!

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:09.802
I have to go. I'm so sorry.

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:17.222
I should go. I really should.

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.365
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.894
The Chad is great.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:03.435
He's great. He's great.

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:07.614
The Chad is great. He's great.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.402
The Chad is great.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:16.539
The Chad is stuck.

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:29.469
I'm having helmet problems.

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:34.640
I'm having serious helmet problems.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:44.852
Nice!
