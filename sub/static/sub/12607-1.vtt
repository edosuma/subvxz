WEBVTT

02:00.307 --> 02:01.137
Vicky and Cristina decided

02:01.275 --> 02:03.106
to spend the summer in Barcelona.

02:04.045 --> 02:05.205
Vicky was completing her master's

02:05.346 --> 02:06.574
in Catalan Identity...

02:06.714 --> 02:08.011
...which she had become
interested in through

02:08.149 --> 02:10.957
her great affection for the
architecture of Gaudi.

02:11.962 --> 02:14.420
Cristina, who spent the
last six months writing,

02:14.555 --> 02:15.522
directing and acting in...

02:15.656 --> 02:17.783
...a 12-minute film which
she then hated...

02:17.925 --> 02:19.790
...had just broken up with
yet another boyfriend,

02:19.927 --> 02:21.861
and longed for a change of scenery.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.129
Everything fell into place
when a distant relative

02:24.265 --> 02:26.096
of Vicky's family
who lived in Barcelona...

02:26.233 --> 02:28.827
...offered to put both girls up
for July and August.

02:30.137 --> 02:32.196
The two had been
close since college

02:32.339 --> 02:33.271
and shared the same tastes

02:33.407 --> 02:34.965
and opinions on most matters.

02:35.109 --> 02:37.236
Yet when it came
to the subject of love,

02:37.445 --> 02:38.139
it would be hard to find

02:38.279 --> 02:40.213
two more dissimilar
viewpoints.

02:40.581 --> 02:42.105
Vicky had no tolerance for pain

02:42.249 --> 02:43.910
and no lust for combat.

02:44.118 --> 02:45.881
She was grounded and realistic.

02:46.420 --> 02:47.250
Her requirements in a man

02:47.388 --> 02:49.356
were seriousness and stability.

02:49.890 --> 02:50.686
She had become engaged to

02:50.825 --> 02:53.453
Doug because he was decent
and successful...

02:53.561 --> 02:55.461
...and understood the beauty
of commitment.

02:56.730 --> 02:58.425
Yeah, I miss you, too.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.459
Cristina, on the other hand,

03:00.601 --> 03:02.899
expected something very
different out of love.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.099
She reluctantly accepted
suffering as

03:05.239 --> 03:07.469
an inevitable component
of deep passion...

03:07.608 --> 03:08.768
...and was resigned to putting

03:08.909 --> 03:10.103
her feelings at risk.

03:10.644 --> 03:13.704
If you asked what she was gambling
her emotions on to win,

03:13.848 --> 03:15.338
she would have been unable to say.

03:15.816 --> 03:17.511
She knew what she didn't want,
however.

03:17.651 --> 03:20.552
And that was exactly what Vicky
valued above all else.

03:30.064 --> 03:31.554
- You're Vicky.
- Yes, yes.

03:31.699 --> 03:33.064
You're so grown up.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.029
It's been a while.
It's great to see you.

03:35.169 --> 03:39.265
Welcome to Barcelona.
Cristina, I'm Judy.

03:39.707 --> 03:40.731
This is your room.

03:41.775 --> 03:42.673
I put you together.

03:43.878 --> 03:45.641
Judy, thank you so much
for having me here.

03:45.779 --> 03:49.613
It was so last-minute
and you don't know me at all.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.548
To include me is so sweet of you.

03:52.686 --> 03:55.655
It's so nice to have
a little action around here.

03:55.789 --> 03:58.485
It's been so quiet since
Arthur went off to college.

03:59.059 --> 04:01.323
After the girls unpacked
and Judy's husband, Mark,

04:01.462 --> 04:04.329
got home from the golf course,
lunch was served.

04:04.598 --> 04:05.360
We have a beautiful home.

04:05.499 --> 04:07.023
We've really come
to love it.

04:07.401 --> 04:09.767
He makes friends with anybody a
nd speaks the language,

04:09.904 --> 04:11.496
so he was like, "Whee!"

04:11.872 --> 04:12.998
You learned just fine.

04:13.207 --> 04:14.401
What do you do, Cristina?

04:15.442 --> 04:17.774
I am currently at liberty.

04:18.245 --> 04:19.803
Come on.
She made a film.

04:20.247 --> 04:22.181
- How exciting.
- It was 12 minutes.

04:22.416 --> 04:23.474
What was it about?

04:23.851 --> 04:24.579
About?

04:24.818 --> 04:29.585
It was about why love is
so hard to define.

04:29.957 --> 04:33.484
That's a mighty big subject
to handle in 12 minutes.

04:34.828 --> 04:37.126
Vicky, you're getting
your master's in...

04:37.264 --> 04:40.392
Yeah, my master's
in Catalan Identity.

04:42.236 --> 04:43.498
What do you plan
on doing with that?

04:44.038 --> 04:48.031
I don't know.
Maybe teaching, maybe curating.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.842
You don't have to do something.

04:50.544 --> 04:52.535
She's marrying this
wonderful man in the fall

04:53.147 --> 04:55.081
and all her conflicts
will be resolved...

04:55.216 --> 04:56.740
...when he makes her pregnant.

04:59.119 --> 05:00.984
Now that Judy's decided
your future...

05:02.656 --> 05:06.092
To your summer in Barcelona.
Welcome.

05:06.293 --> 05:06.816
Salud.

05:10.564 --> 05:11.758
In the days that followed,

05:11.899 --> 05:13.730
Vicky and Cristina drank
in the artistic

05:13.867 --> 05:14.959
treasures of the city.

05:15.803 --> 05:18.772
They particularly enjoyed
the works of Gaudi and Miro.

05:31.218 --> 05:33.618
Once, Mark and Judy invited
Vicky and Cristina

05:33.754 --> 05:36.052
to go sailing with them
on Mark's boat.

05:37.358 --> 05:40.020
With Cristina in mind,
Mark and Judy asked along

05:40.160 --> 05:42.060
the son of one
of his business partners...

05:42.196 --> 05:44.687
...an eligible young man Mark
thought she might like.

05:44.898 --> 05:46.559
My dream is to accumulate
enough wealth, sail off

05:46.700 --> 05:49.430
to an island and spend
my days snorkeling.

05:50.404 --> 05:51.837
I'm actually
a snorkeling nut.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.600
Have you ever snorkeled before?

05:56.010 --> 05:58.035
Unfortunately,
Charles and Cristina

05:58.178 --> 06:00.043
were not a match
made in heaven.

06:00.948 --> 06:02.245
Vicky, meanwhile,
researched

06:02.383 --> 06:04.146
every aspect of Catalan life...

06:04.418 --> 06:05.851
...even getting a tour
of the market

06:05.986 --> 06:08.784
and a local restaurant,
to delve into Catalan cooking.

06:10.991 --> 06:13.016
On balmy summer nights,
the girls would sometimes

06:13.160 --> 06:14.787
go hear Spanish guitar music...

06:14.928 --> 06:16.293
...which never failed to move

06:16.430 --> 06:17.954
Vicky in some magical way.

06:32.346 --> 06:33.836
One evening,
Mark and Judy took them

06:33.981 --> 06:35.972
to the opening
of a friend's art gallery.

06:36.216 --> 06:37.649
Many local artists
and a number

06:37.785 --> 06:39.082
of collectors attended.

06:39.219 --> 06:40.686
- Do you like them?
- I do.

06:40.821 --> 06:42.550
Thank you for taking us.

06:42.890 --> 06:44.084
We buy from this gallery.

06:44.224 --> 06:46.784
Mark has commissioned this artist...

06:46.927 --> 06:48.451
...to do a series of pictures

06:48.662 --> 06:50.892
for his office walls.

06:51.699 --> 06:53.291
Is that the artist over there?

06:53.634 --> 06:54.396
In the red?

06:54.735 --> 06:57.966
No, no. That's not...

07:00.140 --> 07:01.471
Alfred is, um...

07:01.775 --> 07:05.438
He's the gentleman
in the linen coat right there.

07:05.746 --> 07:06.440
That's him.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.880
I don't know who that is.

07:11.652 --> 07:14.485
Mark? Who is the gentleman
in the red shirt over there?

07:14.621 --> 07:17.089
Who is it?

07:18.325 --> 07:21.692
He's a painter.
Remember? Diego told us about him.

07:21.995 --> 07:23.223
He had that fiery relationship

07:23.364 --> 07:25.161
with that beautiful
woman who was nuts.

07:25.699 --> 07:29.931
The violent fighting
and the messy divorce.

07:30.070 --> 07:31.059
It was in all the newspapers.

07:32.206 --> 07:32.900
Oh, my God.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.134
His name is
Juan Antonio Gonzalo...

07:36.276 --> 07:39.074
...and he had
this hot divorce

07:39.213 --> 07:40.305
and she tried to kill him.

07:40.414 --> 07:41.642
Or he tried to kill her.

07:41.782 --> 07:44.478
It was this really
big thing in the art world.

07:44.618 --> 07:46.518
I can't remember the details.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.656
We don't move
in those bohemian circles,

07:50.791 --> 07:51.689
so I don't know.

07:57.865 --> 07:59.696
Vicky and Cristina
left the art gallery

07:59.833 --> 08:00.925
and decided
to go for dinner.

08:01.468 --> 08:03.265
They strolled
past the church

08:03.404 --> 08:04.894
in the wonderful
summer night air,

08:05.038 --> 08:06.335
while people celebrated...

08:06.473 --> 08:07.872
...finally winding up
around midnight

08:08.008 --> 08:09.100
at a little restaurant.

08:10.744 --> 08:13.144
It's nice to be able
to not have to worry

08:13.280 --> 08:15.578
about if some place
is going to stay open.

08:15.716 --> 08:17.616
Yeah, but we probably should

08:17.751 --> 08:20.311
be worrying about our dreams.

08:21.622 --> 08:23.522
Who are you looking at?

08:23.757 --> 08:25.588
Isn't that the painter

08:25.726 --> 08:27.125
we just saw at the gallery?

08:27.828 --> 08:30.092
Oh, yeah.
He's the...

08:30.230 --> 08:32.596
...painter with the bad divorce.

08:32.732 --> 08:34.826
Mark told us.
I was half listening.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.230
He keeps looking over here.

08:36.370 --> 08:39.601
Because you keep
provoking contact.

08:39.740 --> 08:40.900
I'm not provoking contact.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.599
You've been throwing him little

08:42.743 --> 08:43.903
looks all night.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.534
I'm just drinking my wine.

08:45.879 --> 08:47.244
Yeah, of course you are.

08:47.381 --> 08:48.507
You must be doing something

08:48.649 --> 08:50.844
because he's coming over.

09:05.799 --> 09:06.458
American?

09:07.568 --> 09:10.059
I'm Cristina and this
is my friend, Vicky.

09:11.305 --> 09:12.602
What color are your eyes?

09:15.609 --> 09:16.371
They're blue.

09:18.979 --> 09:21.675
I would like to invite you
both to come with me to Oviedo.

09:22.082 --> 09:23.014
To come where?

09:23.584 --> 09:24.346
To Oviedo.

09:25.252 --> 09:27.345
For the weekend.
We leave in one hour.

09:28.455 --> 09:29.979
Where is Oviedo?

09:30.190 --> 09:31.157
A very short flight.

09:31.291 --> 09:32.189
By plane?

09:32.593 --> 09:33.753
What's in Oviedo?

09:34.294 --> 09:37.627
A sculpture that is
very inspiring to me.

09:37.764 --> 09:38.992
A very beautiful sculpture.

09:39.132 --> 09:39.826
You'll love it.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.302
You're asking us
to fly to Oviedo and back?

09:46.340 --> 09:47.568
No, we'll spend the weekend.

09:48.475 --> 09:50.306
I'll show you around the city.

09:51.144 --> 09:54.045
We'll eat well,
we'll drink good wine,

09:54.181 --> 09:55.011
we'll make love.

09:55.148 --> 09:58.379
Who exactly is going
to make love?

09:58.919 --> 10:00.250
Hopefully, the three of us.

10:01.421 --> 10:03.082
- Oh, my God.
- I'll get your bill.

10:03.223 --> 10:04.747
This guy doesn't beat
around the bush.

10:04.892 --> 10:08.191
Look, senor, maybe
in a different life.

10:09.796 --> 10:11.889
Why not?
Life is short.

10:12.299 --> 10:14.961
Life is dull.
Life is full of pain.

10:15.102 --> 10:17.093
This is a chance
for something special.

10:17.671 --> 10:19.730
Right.
Who exactly are you?

10:19.873 --> 10:21.932
I am Juan Antonio.
And you are...

10:23.076 --> 10:26.011
...Vicky, and you are Cristina.
Right?

10:26.613 --> 10:28.774
Or is it the
other way around?

10:28.916 --> 10:30.975
It could be the
other way around...

10:31.118 --> 10:33.279
...because either of us

10:33.420 --> 10:34.614
will do to keep
the bed warm.

10:34.755 --> 10:35.915
I get it.

10:36.323 --> 10:38.621
Well, you are both so
lovely and beautiful.

10:38.725 --> 10:39.384
Well, thank you,

10:39.526 --> 10:42.188
but we do not fly
off to make love...

10:42.329 --> 10:43.296
...with whoever invites us

10:43.430 --> 10:45.694
to charming little
Spanish towns.

10:46.633 --> 10:50.069
Does she always analyze
every inspiration...

10:50.337 --> 10:52.703
...until each grain
of charm is...

10:56.376 --> 10:57.638
...squeezed out of it?

10:59.046 --> 11:01.412
I guess I have to say that...

11:04.318 --> 11:06.309
...my eyes are green,
actually.

11:08.188 --> 11:10.122
I wouldn't call our reluctance...

11:10.257 --> 11:12.316
...to leap at your sexual

11:12.459 --> 11:14.552
offer being over-analytical.

11:14.695 --> 11:17.061
If you would care to join us
for some...

11:17.331 --> 11:19.595
...recognized form
of social interaction

11:19.733 --> 11:21.633
like a drink,
we'd be fine...

11:21.768 --> 11:23.497
...but otherwise,
I think you should try

11:23.637 --> 11:26.162
offering to some
other table.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.598
What offended you about the offer?

11:30.177 --> 11:31.166
Surely not that I find you

11:31.311 --> 11:33.779
both beautiful and desirable.

11:34.147 --> 11:35.409
Offended me?
No.

11:35.549 --> 11:38.382
It's very amusing... galling,

11:38.518 --> 11:40.509
to be honest, but...

11:41.154 --> 11:43.486
Is it my imagination
or is it getting a little late?

11:43.624 --> 11:45.990
I would love to go to Oviedo.

11:46.326 --> 11:47.384
What? Are you kidding?

11:47.628 --> 11:49.061
I think it would be so much fun.

11:49.196 --> 11:51.323
I think we should go.
I'd love to go.

11:51.431 --> 11:53.422
Can we discuss
this some other time?

11:53.567 --> 11:55.364
When I saw you across the room

11:55.502 --> 11:56.560
at the art gallery...

11:57.037 --> 11:58.971
...I noticed you have...

11:59.840 --> 12:03.742
...beautiful lips.
Very full, very sensual.

12:04.244 --> 12:04.710
Thank you.

12:04.845 --> 12:06.779
Okay, okay, look.
I'm s-, you know, if you wanna go...

12:06.913 --> 12:08.574
I can't guarantee
the lovemaking-

12:08.715 --> 12:10.649
because I happen to be very moody.

12:11.485 --> 12:13.680
Let's not negotiate
like a contract.

12:14.287 --> 12:16.551
I came over here with
no subterfuge,

12:16.690 --> 12:18.351
and presented my best offer.

12:18.925 --> 12:21.519
I hope you will discuss
it and give me

12:21.662 --> 12:23.653
the pleasure to take you
with me to Oviedo.

12:24.131 --> 12:24.859
I have the good fortune

12:24.998 --> 12:26.556
to borrow my friend's plane.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.225
It's just big enough
for the three of us

12:29.369 --> 12:30.267
and I'm a very good pilot.

12:30.404 --> 12:31.803
It sounds very safe.

12:33.140 --> 12:34.004
Think it over.

12:38.679 --> 12:41.011
I hope you're joking about going.

12:41.181 --> 12:42.876
Oh, my God,
This guy is so interesting.

12:43.016 --> 12:43.744
Interesting!?

12:43.884 --> 12:44.748
Are you kidding?
What's so interesting?

12:44.885 --> 12:46.443
He wants to get us both into bed.

12:46.586 --> 12:47.780
But he'll settle for either.

12:47.921 --> 12:49.445
In this case, you.

12:49.690 --> 12:51.954
Vicky, I'm a big girl, okay?

12:52.092 --> 12:53.525
If I want to sleep with him,
I will.

12:53.660 --> 12:54.649
If not, I won't.

12:54.928 --> 12:56.623
Cristina,
he's a total stranger.

12:56.763 --> 12:58.560
This is impulsive,
even for you...

12:58.699 --> 13:00.530
...and if I heard right,

13:00.667 --> 13:02.794
he was violent with his wife.

13:02.936 --> 13:03.698
At least he's not one

13:03.837 --> 13:06.397
of those factory-made zombies,
you know?

13:06.540 --> 13:08.565
This is a great way
to get to know him.

13:08.709 --> 13:11.041
No, it's not.
I'm not going to Oviedo...

13:11.178 --> 13:13.703
...with this charmingly
candid wife beater.

13:13.847 --> 13:16.839
You find his
aggressiveness attractive,

13:16.983 --> 13:17.642
but I don't.

13:17.784 --> 13:20.344
And he's certainly
not handsome.

13:20.554 --> 13:21.851
I think he's very handsome.

13:21.988 --> 13:22.920
He has a great look.

13:23.056 --> 13:25.081
I mean, he's really sexy.

13:25.258 --> 13:28.659
Well, you would,
because you're a neurotic.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.556
You have to admire
his no-bullshit approach.

13:30.697 --> 13:31.459
What are you talking about?

13:31.598 --> 13:34.499
It's all bullshit.
I'm not going to Oviedo.

13:34.634 --> 13:36.625
First off,
I never heard of Oviedo.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.169
I don't find him winning.

13:38.305 --> 13:40.102
Third, even if
I wasn't engaged...

13:40.240 --> 13:41.571
...and was free
to have some kind

13:41.708 --> 13:43.005
of dalliance
with a Spaniard,

13:43.143 --> 13:44.872
I wouldn't pick this one.

13:45.245 --> 13:48.772
Oh, hi.
I can't talk right now.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.906
I'm trying
to save Cristina

13:51.051 --> 13:54.111
from making a potentially
fatal mistake.

13:54.421 --> 13:57.322
What? No, the usual.

13:57.624 --> 13:58.818
I'll call you back.

13:59.259 --> 14:00.191
I love you, too.

14:00.861 --> 14:02.294
If we go back
to the house now,

14:02.429 --> 14:03.760
we can just throw
some things in a bag

14:03.897 --> 14:05.364
and we'll meet him there.

14:05.465 --> 14:07.524
I took an instant liking
to this guy.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.830
He's not one of these
cookie-cutter molds.

14:10.971 --> 14:14.566
- He's creative and artistic.
- Cookie-cutter mold?

14:14.708 --> 14:16.335
Is that what you think
of Doug?

14:17.010 --> 14:18.841
Doug?
Who said anything about Doug?

14:19.212 --> 14:19.871
It's ridiculous.

14:20.013 --> 14:22.072
You like the way
it sounds to pick up

14:22.215 --> 14:24.342
and fly off in an airplane.

14:24.484 --> 14:25.883
I know. I don't know
why I'm so scared,

14:26.019 --> 14:27.452
unless I'm scared of myself.

14:27.587 --> 14:30.078
It's a mistake, Cristina.

14:38.698 --> 14:40.495
They predicted a little
storm out of the town,

14:40.634 --> 14:42.727
out of Oviedo,
but it's nothing serious.

14:42.903 --> 14:45.303
Don't worry, really.
As you can see here...

14:47.507 --> 14:49.873
There, it's just
a little bumpy, right?

14:53.580 --> 14:56.344
- Would you like to fly it?
- No, thank you!

14:56.516 --> 14:59.076
It's easy.
It's even easier than a car.

14:59.219 --> 15:00.049
Try it.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.186
By early morning,

15:06.326 --> 15:07.554
they had reached
their destination...

15:07.694 --> 15:09.025
...and proceeded to a hotel

15:09.129 --> 15:11.188
that Juan Antonio
had selected for them.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.557
Vicky made sure she and Cristina

15:14.701 --> 15:15.395
had their own room

15:15.535 --> 15:17.298
and Juan Antonio had his.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.165
If he was disappointed,
he hid it well.

15:22.108 --> 15:23.268
After freshening up, he took them

15:23.410 --> 15:25.708
to see the sculpture that was
so meaningful to him.

15:25.846 --> 15:27.143
Are you very religious?

15:27.280 --> 15:29.145
No. No, I'm not.

15:29.416 --> 15:30.883
The trick is to enjoy life,

15:31.585 --> 15:34.179
accepting it
has no meaning whatsoever.

15:34.321 --> 15:35.549
No meaning? You don't even

15:35.689 --> 15:37.919
think that authentic
love gives life meaning?

15:38.491 --> 15:42.689
Yes, but love is so transient,
isn't it?

15:42.863 --> 15:46.230
I was in love with the most
incredible woman...

15:47.234 --> 15:50.670
...and in the end...

15:52.839 --> 15:53.601
Yes?

15:54.908 --> 15:56.375
...she put a knife into me.

15:56.643 --> 15:58.508
My God, that's terrible.

15:58.778 --> 16:00.746
Maybe you did something
to deserve it.

16:02.649 --> 16:04.640
Juan Antonio took
his guests for lunch.

16:05.151 --> 16:07.210
They discussed art
and romance.

16:07.721 --> 16:09.518
He was full of stories
about Maria Elena,

16:09.656 --> 16:10.554
his ex-wife...

16:10.690 --> 16:13.318
...whom he both criticized
and idolized.

16:14.728 --> 16:16.923
He proved to be a good host,
and in the afternoon,

16:17.063 --> 16:18.530
he took them to see
the local sights...

16:18.665 --> 16:20.530
...where they enjoyed
hearing about the city

16:20.667 --> 16:21.599
and took photos.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.978
Later, they bought candy and
cakes at a charming sweet shop...

16:34.214 --> 16:36.239
...which were
homemade and delicious.

16:41.421 --> 16:43.150
They continued
to document their trip

16:43.423 --> 16:45.152
and while Vicky
remained skeptical...

16:45.392 --> 16:47.053
...Cristina had
a wonderful time.

16:54.134 --> 16:55.863
The question
of sleeping together

16:56.036 --> 16:57.697
did not come up until
that night...

16:57.837 --> 17:00.032
...and Juan Antonio was
a little drunk.

17:00.573 --> 17:01.335
You're welcome.

17:07.814 --> 17:09.748
Well, now that the day
is almost over...

17:11.550 --> 17:14.076
...is it reasonable
of me to ask you

17:14.487 --> 17:16.284
if you would both join
me in my room?

17:16.623 --> 17:18.682
Come on.
I thought we settled that.

17:18.825 --> 17:21.453
Vicky's just trying to say
she's engaged to be married, that's all.

17:21.594 --> 17:23.858
Great. Then these are her
last days of freedom.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.462
No. Look, I'm not free.

17:26.665 --> 17:27.690
I'm committed.

17:27.968 --> 17:28.992
You know what my theory is?

17:29.135 --> 17:30.830
When I drink,
I get brutally frank.

17:30.971 --> 17:33.439
I... I think that you're still hurting

17:33.573 --> 17:37.031
from the failure of your marriage
to Maria Elena,

17:37.177 --> 17:40.635
and you're trying to
lose yourself in empty sex.

17:40.914 --> 17:43.246
Empty sex? Do you have such

17:43.383 --> 17:44.873
a low opinion of yourself?

17:45.485 --> 17:48.147
She's just saying it has to
have meaning for her, that's all.

17:48.722 --> 17:50.690
I mean, the city is romantic.

17:51.024 --> 17:53.117
The night is warm and balmy.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.985
We are alive.
Isn't that meaning enough?

17:56.229 --> 17:58.356
I just came along to
keep Cristina company.

17:58.498 --> 18:00.489
I'm engaged to be married.

18:00.633 --> 18:01.327
I have a handsome,

18:01.468 --> 18:04.835
lovely fiance
who I make love with...

18:04.971 --> 18:05.869
...who also holds a

18:06.006 --> 18:08.201
very real place in my heart.

18:08.341 --> 18:10.775
And to be perfectly frank,
Juan Antonio...

18:10.910 --> 18:12.639
...if I were the type
of person who played around,

18:12.779 --> 18:14.644
I don't think it's
in the cards for us.

18:14.781 --> 18:16.612
So, I'm tired.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.412
I haven't slept
in twenty-four hours...

18:19.552 --> 18:22.248
...and that is exactly
what I'm going to do.

18:24.057 --> 18:24.887
And you?

18:26.393 --> 18:27.325
I'll go to your room,

18:27.460 --> 18:30.827
but you have to seduce me.

18:34.801 --> 18:35.426
Hello.

18:35.568 --> 18:36.398
Hello.

18:38.505 --> 18:41.997
I am just here to have
a quick drink...

18:43.043 --> 18:43.839
...to say thank you,

18:43.977 --> 18:45.911
then I'm going back to my room.

18:49.449 --> 18:51.246
Did you act in the
small film you made?

18:51.751 --> 18:54.219
Did I act?
Yeah, I acted. Why?

18:54.354 --> 18:55.446
I hope you were more convincing

18:55.588 --> 18:57.556
than you are pretending
to have come here

18:57.690 --> 18:59.021
for one quick drink.

19:01.127 --> 19:03.061
I am here to go
to bed with you.

19:03.196 --> 19:04.094
You're right.

19:06.199 --> 19:09.498
So you're pretty much home free,
unless you...

19:10.370 --> 19:11.860
...blow it.
- Blow it?

19:12.005 --> 19:12.937
Yeah.

19:13.506 --> 19:14.473
Blow it.

19:14.607 --> 19:16.006
You mean ruin the moment?

19:16.643 --> 19:17.302
Yeah.

19:17.444 --> 19:19.241
And how would
I do that?

19:21.548 --> 19:23.812
I don't know.
It could be anything from...

19:24.117 --> 19:27.177
...some inane comment to...

19:27.821 --> 19:29.584
...wearing the wrong kind
of shorts.

19:30.290 --> 19:33.157
Although... somehow,
by looking at you...

19:33.293 --> 19:35.784
...I think you're wearing
the right kind of shorts.

19:36.229 --> 19:37.787
You're very hard to please.

19:38.431 --> 19:42.333
Yeah, well... I am famous
for my intolerance.

19:46.506 --> 19:48.269
And what do you
want in life

19:48.408 --> 19:50.376
besides a man with the
right shorts?

19:54.614 --> 19:55.581
I don't know.

19:57.083 --> 20:00.280
I know I'm not going
to settle until

20:00.420 --> 20:01.853
I find what I'm looking for.

20:02.422 --> 20:04.049
Which is what?

20:09.496 --> 20:13.159
Something... else.
I want something different.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.425
Something more.

20:15.702 --> 20:20.366
Some sort of...
counterintuitive love.

20:22.408 --> 20:23.602
Meaning?

20:25.645 --> 20:27.579
Meaning, um...

20:28.615 --> 20:29.673
I don't know.

20:31.384 --> 20:32.874
I don't know what I want.

20:33.086 --> 20:34.553
I only know
what I don't want.

20:35.989 --> 20:37.854
If you don't start
undressing me soon,

20:37.991 --> 20:40.255
this is going to turn
into a panel discussion.

20:57.944 --> 20:59.036
Are you okay?

20:59.312 --> 21:02.008
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's something I ate.

21:02.782 --> 21:04.374
What's wrong?
Can I get you anything?

21:05.752 --> 21:08.687
No,
I... I shouldn't be drinking.

21:09.022 --> 21:10.649
- What happened?
- I'm going to be sick.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.388
It's her ulcer and perhaps
food poisoning.

21:16.529 --> 21:17.257
Maybe both.

21:17.397 --> 21:18.159
God, both.

21:18.298 --> 21:20.766
- She must just rest. Not eat.
- Rest?

21:20.900 --> 21:22.561
Yeah, rest, rest.

21:22.869 --> 21:24.336
With Cristina stuck in bed,

21:24.504 --> 21:25.471
Vicky was anxious to get back

21:25.605 --> 21:27.800
to Barcelona
and in no mood to sightsee.

21:29.008 --> 21:30.873
When he gets out of his meeting,

21:31.010 --> 21:32.773
can you get him
to call me on my cell?

21:33.379 --> 21:35.438
Yeah, I'm still stuck in Oviedo.

21:36.783 --> 21:38.410
But sightsee is what they did.

21:39.319 --> 21:41.549
I feel very sorry about Cristina.

21:41.654 --> 21:44.748
Oh, come on.
Don't pretend concern.

21:45.191 --> 21:47.955
I'm sure you kept
encouraging her to drink...

21:48.328 --> 21:50.387
...as you did to both of us
throughout dinner.

21:51.064 --> 21:52.827
But I can hold my liquor.

21:53.099 --> 21:55.795
- She never mentioned her ulcer.
- No.

21:55.902 --> 21:59.360
No, because she's
a mental adolescent...

21:59.505 --> 22:03.407
...and being romantic,
she has a death wish.

22:03.543 --> 22:05.943
So for a brief moment
of passion...

22:06.079 --> 22:10.607
...she completely abandons
all responsibilities.

22:12.018 --> 22:14.009
After lunch,
Juan Antonio took Vicky

22:14.153 --> 22:16.314
to see the old
lighthouse at Aviles...

22:16.556 --> 22:18.023
...which she found very beautiful.

22:20.860 --> 22:21.918
I was born near here.

22:22.061 --> 22:25.462
It would be a sin
if I came out here without

22:25.598 --> 22:27.190
paying a visit to my father.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.527
Would that be boring to you?

22:29.068 --> 22:30.126
No.

22:30.803 --> 22:34.170
No, I think that would
be the first genuinely

22:34.307 --> 22:35.968
interesting proposition
you've made me.

22:36.109 --> 22:39.909
I would love to see your
father and his house.

22:58.831 --> 22:59.798
My father, Julio.

23:05.338 --> 23:07.738
Oh, you know, if we carry on,
I don't think it's gonna...

23:07.940 --> 23:08.998
That's fine.
That was great.

23:09.409 --> 23:10.467
He speaks no English.

23:15.848 --> 23:17.611
I'm sure my Spanish
is going to go.

23:17.717 --> 23:19.708
He refuses to speak
any other language.

23:19.852 --> 23:22.116
That's an important point
with my father, actually.

23:22.255 --> 23:22.983
Really? Why?

23:23.122 --> 23:25.955
Because he's a poet
and he writes the most

23:26.092 --> 23:28.185
beautiful sentences
in the Spanish language...

23:28.328 --> 23:31.456
...but he doesn't
believe a poet...

23:31.564 --> 23:35.022
...should pollute his words
by any other tongue which is...

23:35.168 --> 23:36.157
- No, it...
...quite a f...

23:36.302 --> 23:39.362
...no, it makes sense, I understand,
because of the translation...

23:39.505 --> 23:41.405
...and the things
you might lose.

23:41.607 --> 23:43.734
I took some Spanish.

23:43.876 --> 23:46.276
Of course,
I have no flair for languages.

23:46.412 --> 23:48.812
I read it much
better than I speak it.

23:49.048 --> 23:51.414
Maybe I could
read your father.

23:51.551 --> 23:53.348
No, he doesn't publish.
That's the point.

23:54.721 --> 23:55.710
Well, why not?

23:56.322 --> 23:57.619
I'll explain later.

23:57.757 --> 23:58.689
Do you want some Cognac?

23:59.959 --> 24:01.051
Yes, thank you.

24:01.194 --> 24:03.253
Just a very, very,
very little.

24:04.697 --> 24:06.528
You look good...
you look healthy, Papa.

24:07.166 --> 24:09.657
Yes, and you, too,
look well.

24:10.036 --> 24:11.765
What do you hear
of Maria Elena?

24:12.372 --> 24:16.468
She's still living
with the architect in Madrid.

24:17.210 --> 24:18.507
That woman was the best.

24:19.011 --> 24:22.412
I still have erotic dreams
about her, at my age.

24:22.815 --> 24:24.612
She also loved
you very much, Papa.

24:24.717 --> 24:28.448
What a shame...
with that gift of God...

24:35.027 --> 24:38.292
This was my favorite place
to read when I was young.

24:38.598 --> 24:42.227
And, yes, I wanted
to be a writer, not a painter.

24:42.368 --> 24:43.835
Painting came later.

24:44.404 --> 24:46.338
And I wanted
to play music, too.

24:46.973 --> 24:49.771
I mean, all I knew is
that I was full of...

24:49.909 --> 24:50.534
I don't know...

24:50.676 --> 24:51.438
- real emotion,

24:51.577 --> 24:53.704
and I had to find
a way to express it.

24:54.514 --> 24:56.641
Cristina says
the same thing.

24:56.783 --> 24:58.182
Cristina is a
very interesting girl.

24:58.317 --> 24:59.113
Want to sit?

24:59.252 --> 24:59.911
Yeah.

25:01.387 --> 25:02.183
So...

25:03.389 --> 25:04.583
...tell me, why won't your

25:04.724 --> 25:06.624
father publish his poems?

25:08.327 --> 25:11.353
Because he hates the world...

25:11.497 --> 25:14.625
...and that's his way
of getting back at them.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.698
To create beautiful
works and then...

25:18.171 --> 25:21.163
...deny them to the public,
which I think is...

25:21.741 --> 25:22.537
My God.

25:23.209 --> 25:24.039
Well, what makes him

25:24.177 --> 25:27.408
so angry toward
the human race?

25:27.747 --> 25:30.875
Because after thousands of
years of civilization...

25:31.451 --> 25:33.180
...they still haven't
learned to love.

25:35.321 --> 25:36.515
They returned to the hotel.

25:37.356 --> 25:38.448
Cristina was feeling better,

25:38.591 --> 25:41.355
but far too shaky
and needed more rest.

25:42.562 --> 25:44.189
Vicky and Juan Antonio
dined together

25:44.330 --> 25:45.763
at a lovely
little restaurant.

25:46.432 --> 25:47.922
She was more relaxed
than at lunch,

25:48.067 --> 25:49.830
and had just finished
a great deal of wine.

25:50.770 --> 25:53.034
This time she was enjoying
the conversation.

25:53.372 --> 25:54.498
...no place on earth.

25:54.907 --> 25:56.238
My father used
to bring me here.

26:03.182 --> 26:04.046
Hello?

26:04.350 --> 26:06.875
Hey. Did I get you at
a bad time, babe?

26:07.420 --> 26:09.615
No, I'm just about to eat.

26:09.755 --> 26:11.279
Can I call you back?

26:11.591 --> 26:12.683
Let me just say one thing.

26:12.825 --> 26:14.850
Paul and Maryanne
found a house up where they are...

26:14.994 --> 26:17.656
...that they like even better
than the one in Bedford Hills.

26:17.997 --> 26:21.296
Oh, yeah?
Uh, you're breaking up a little.

26:22.068 --> 26:24.400
How...? Babe?
Call me later,

26:24.537 --> 26:26.664
but this house has a pool
and a tennis court.

26:26.772 --> 26:27.830
We could both take lessons

26:27.974 --> 26:29.441
from Paul's instructor.

26:30.209 --> 26:31.767
Okay, I'll call you back.

26:31.911 --> 26:33.435
I can't hear you.

26:33.980 --> 26:34.742
I love you.

26:37.316 --> 26:40.080
God.
The connection's terrible.

26:48.127 --> 26:50.459
- What is this wine? It's delicious.
- It's great.

26:52.598 --> 26:54.088
Was that your fiance?

26:54.767 --> 26:56.598
Uh, yes, yes.

26:57.637 --> 26:59.696
Why were you so nervous
speaking to him?

27:00.406 --> 27:01.839
Was I nervous?

27:02.208 --> 27:03.607
Yes, you turned red.

27:04.510 --> 27:07.741
Well,
I'm sure it's the wine.

27:08.281 --> 27:09.145
Would he be upset

27:09.282 --> 27:10.943
if he knew
we were dining together?

27:11.117 --> 27:12.982
No, not at all!
Are you kidding?

27:13.719 --> 27:17.587
I mean, I don't think
he'd love the basic concept...

27:17.723 --> 27:21.557
...of me sitting with a man
drinking wine over candlelight

27:21.694 --> 27:25.494
...but he'd quickly realize there was
nothing to worry about, so...

27:26.699 --> 27:30.157
Would you ever withhold your work
from the public out of rage?

27:30.469 --> 27:32.562
No-no-no.
I'm not like my father.

27:32.772 --> 27:33.466
No, I told you...

27:33.606 --> 27:37.098
...I affirm life,
despite everything.

27:38.177 --> 27:39.303
Right, right.

27:39.712 --> 27:44.411
Well. I'd be curious
to see your work.

27:45.718 --> 27:46.446
Really?

27:47.820 --> 27:51.085
Why? I mean, you are
so disapproving of me.

27:52.291 --> 27:54.589
Well, I've gotten
to know you better.

27:55.194 --> 27:58.129
It'd be interesting,
and after all,

27:58.264 --> 27:59.458
you are a Catalan painter

27:59.599 --> 28:00.531
and that's my subject.

28:00.666 --> 28:02.964
What gave you such
an interest in Catalan culture?

28:03.269 --> 28:08.707
I fell in love with Gaudi's church
when I was fourteen...

28:08.841 --> 28:10.775
...and one thing led to another.

28:13.879 --> 28:17.007
You also admire Spanish guitar,
I hear.

28:17.283 --> 28:20.116
Yes, yes. I love the guitar.

28:20.419 --> 28:21.511
Would you like to go hear

28:21.654 --> 28:24.122
some wonderful guitar tonight?

28:24.724 --> 28:25.486
Tonight?

28:26.759 --> 28:30.058
Well, it's a little late,
and...

28:30.196 --> 28:32.926
...l'm a little wobbly
from the wine.

28:33.933 --> 28:36.265
You said
you could hold your alcohol.

28:36.902 --> 28:38.392
Besides,
we leave tomorrow.

28:41.874 --> 28:43.034
Okay, sure.

28:43.175 --> 28:44.142
Great.

29:42.501 --> 29:44.901
That was unbelievable.

29:45.004 --> 29:46.062
Thank you, thank you.

29:46.205 --> 29:49.732
I was looking at your face
and you looked very moved.

29:49.875 --> 29:50.398
Yes, yes.

29:50.543 --> 29:52.511
A few times, I saw a look like that.

29:53.112 --> 29:55.580
Right.
On Maria Elena, I'm sure.

29:55.715 --> 29:57.376
Well, yes, maybe on Maria Elena.

29:57.516 --> 29:59.040
If she saw...

29:59.185 --> 30:01.346
...or heard something
that moved her, yes.

30:03.689 --> 30:05.179
You're still
in love with her.

30:06.926 --> 30:09.417
No, I'm not,
I'm not.

30:10.629 --> 30:11.721
That confirms it.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.457
No, she will always
be a part of me.

30:15.434 --> 30:17.197
She's an important
person in my life...

30:17.336 --> 30:18.530
...but for the two of us,

30:18.671 --> 30:21.640
something was not working.

30:23.075 --> 30:24.167
What element?

30:25.144 --> 30:26.406
We never found out.

30:31.050 --> 30:37.546
You, um... you said you were
l-looking at my face.

30:38.557 --> 30:39.387
Why?

30:39.792 --> 30:41.225
Why were you
looking at mine?

30:41.927 --> 30:42.791
Was I?

30:43.129 --> 30:44.687
You probably saw my tears.

30:44.830 --> 30:50.462
Yeah... I'm a little out
of control.

30:50.736 --> 30:51.760
I was looking at your face

30:51.904 --> 30:54.134
because I find it very beautiful.

30:54.974 --> 30:57.272
- You do?
- Of course I do.

30:58.911 --> 30:59.639
Of course I do.

30:59.779 --> 31:00.746
You know I do.

31:33.379 --> 31:34.607
On the trip home, Vicky,

31:34.747 --> 31:37.545
who had mentioned nothing
to Cristina, was silent.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.042
Cristina, on the other hand,
talked nervously.

31:40.152 --> 31:44.145
I must apologize to both of you
for ruining the whole weekend!

31:44.290 --> 31:45.655
I'm completely mortified!

31:45.791 --> 31:47.349
I'm humiliated.

31:47.493 --> 31:50.257
I don't know if it was the wine,
or the shellfish.

31:50.396 --> 31:52.557
Because I have this ulcer.

31:52.698 --> 31:55.098
I just thank God
you knew enough sights

31:55.234 --> 31:56.633
to keep Vicky occupied.

31:57.169 --> 31:58.466
I had these horrible nightmares

31:58.604 --> 32:00.663
that you two would be
like oil and water...

32:00.806 --> 32:03.001
...hating every minute
of being together.

32:03.309 --> 32:04.742
I just couldn't move.

32:07.646 --> 32:09.807
Vicky buried herself
in work at the library.

32:10.616 --> 32:12.208
She put foolish ideas out
of her head

32:12.351 --> 32:14.080
and concentrated on her thesis.

32:14.420 --> 32:17.321
But she found her thoughts
frequently returning to Oviedo.

32:19.859 --> 32:22.487
Cristina, searching for a means
of self- expression...

32:22.828 --> 32:24.625
...wandered the streets of Barcelona,

32:25.030 --> 32:26.827
experimented with her latest passion,

32:26.999 --> 32:27.863
photography...

32:28.334 --> 32:30.097
...and believed that she had
made a fool of herself...

32:30.236 --> 32:32.796
...exactly at the moment
of truth with Juan Antonio.

32:34.139 --> 32:35.868
And then, 48 hours later,

32:36.008 --> 32:37.942
Cristina came to Vicky
with an announcement.

32:38.110 --> 32:39.543
Vicky, he called!

32:40.312 --> 32:41.301
What? Who?

32:41.413 --> 32:43.677
Juan Antonio.
He called me just now.

32:44.884 --> 32:46.317
Juan Antonio called you?

32:46.385 --> 32:49.445
Yeah, he wants to
take me to some vineyard...

32:49.588 --> 32:50.816
...some wine tasting or something.

32:50.956 --> 32:52.116
I said, "Absolutely."

32:52.391 --> 32:54.052
A wine tasting.

32:54.293 --> 32:56.955
But what about your ulcer?

32:57.363 --> 32:58.295
No, it's fine.

32:58.430 --> 32:59.727
A little wine's
not going to hurt me.

32:59.865 --> 33:01.833
The point is that he wants to see me!

33:02.201 --> 33:03.190
Isn't that great?

33:03.302 --> 33:04.633
Yeah, yeah.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.795
I can't believe it.
I never thought he would call.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.370
That's great. I'm happy for you.

33:12.645 --> 33:15.808
That night, the two women
had trouble falling asleep.

33:15.948 --> 33:19.577
Cristina sat in the kitchen, drinking
coffee and working on her poetry.

33:23.756 --> 33:25.815
Vicky, too, was lost in memories
of a night

33:25.958 --> 33:28.426
that now seemed more
and more unreal.

33:42.408 --> 33:43.238
Hello.

33:43.642 --> 33:44.438
Hey, babe.

33:44.977 --> 33:45.909
Did I wake you?

33:47.012 --> 33:48.741
No, no...

33:48.981 --> 33:50.471
I was just going to sleep.

33:51.717 --> 33:52.684
I'm sorry I called so late.

33:52.818 --> 33:53.716
I had to get out of the office.

33:53.852 --> 33:57.310
Get some air, get some coffee,
and I had this great idea.

33:57.456 --> 33:58.445
Check this out.

33:59.491 --> 34:01.789
Dad has contacts in
the American Embassy in Spain.

34:01.927 --> 34:04.828
I thought I'd come early,
work from there on my computer

34:04.964 --> 34:07.125
and we could get married
in Barcelona.

34:07.599 --> 34:08.690
You said it was
a romantic spot.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.665
We'll just do a quick
city hall-type thing.

34:10.803 --> 34:12.100
Of course, we'll do
it again in New York...

34:12.237 --> 34:14.501
and you know, and have a huge
blowout for our families and friends,

34:14.639 --> 34:16.301
but I thought it'd be fun.
What do you think?

34:16.809 --> 34:19.175
What? To get married here?

34:19.478 --> 34:20.137
Why not?

34:20.279 --> 34:22.076
It'd be great to tell our kids
we got married in Spain...

34:22.214 --> 34:24.876
...and Dad's friends would
make it real easy for us.

34:26.618 --> 34:29.143
I don't know what to say.

34:30.456 --> 34:31.889
You don't sound bowled over.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.681
No, it's, uh...

34:35.127 --> 34:36.788
...it's just a surprise.

34:37.496 --> 34:39.828
So, w-, eh, look, we're gonna
marry in the fall anyway,

34:39.965 --> 34:41.795
and we're gonna do that, too.
I promise.

34:41.934 --> 34:43.629
Yeah, so what's the point?

34:44.069 --> 34:45.866
The point is, it's different,
it's exciting.

34:46.005 --> 34:47.165
I told Ken and Alice.

34:47.306 --> 34:50.503
I called them earlier and
they said they wish they'd done it.

34:50.641 --> 34:53.577
I mean, London in their case,
but they were excited.

34:54.346 --> 34:56.246
Well, I, uh...

34:57.783 --> 35:00.479
You sound a bit reluctant.

35:01.053 --> 35:04.921
Me? No. Why would I be?

35:06.792 --> 35:08.384
No, I...

35:09.728 --> 35:11.195
...I think it's a fine idea.

35:12.097 --> 35:12.859
I think it's great.

35:12.998 --> 35:14.090
It's a great idea.

35:14.333 --> 35:16.699
Yeah, I think it's
going to be good.

35:16.835 --> 35:17.893
I'll call you tomorrow.

35:18.037 --> 35:19.061
I know I woke you.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.603
I'll give you more
details tomorrow.

35:20.739 --> 35:22.138
I love you so much.

35:57.676 --> 36:00.236
Juan Antonio took Cristina
to a wine tasting.

36:00.913 --> 36:04.212
After, he took her back to his house,
a lovely place he had purchased

36:04.349 --> 36:05.680
from another painter
years ago...

36:05.818 --> 36:08.150
...and which served as his home
and his studio.

36:09.154 --> 36:11.179
He showed her his work,
which delighted her.

36:11.857 --> 36:13.188
She loved the
colors and the wild,

36:13.325 --> 36:15.919
emotional way he applied
the paint to the canvases.

36:16.562 --> 36:19.497
From there, it was only one floor
up to his bedroom.

36:20.466 --> 36:22.627
He told her of his marriage
to Maria Elena,

36:23.001 --> 36:24.195
and their deep love...

36:24.369 --> 36:25.597
...and their terrible fights.

36:26.338 --> 36:28.636
He told her he had not wanted
to make love with anyone else

36:28.774 --> 36:31.038
in the bedroom they shared...
till now.

36:31.910 --> 36:34.208
This time,
Cristina kept her food down.

37:26.665 --> 37:28.656
Juan took Cristina out
several more times.

37:29.401 --> 37:31.665
They went to see a new sculpture
by a friend of his.

37:35.374 --> 37:36.705
He showed her some
of his favorite parts

37:36.842 --> 37:38.742
of the city,
where she took photographs.

37:40.045 --> 37:42.036
Juan Antonio was friendly
with all the whores

37:42.181 --> 37:43.808
and thought they would
make wonderful subjects.

37:52.558 --> 37:53.991
He encouraged Cristina's work,
although

37:54.126 --> 37:56.594
she was always too
shy to allow him to see it.

37:58.964 --> 38:00.431
He took her to lunch
with his friends,

38:00.566 --> 38:03.034
who were poets and
artists and musicians.

38:03.502 --> 38:05.129
Cristina held her
own quite well.

38:08.974 --> 38:12.000
Meanwhile, one day, going to study
yet again the Park Guell...

38:12.144 --> 38:13.202
...which Gaudi had designed

38:13.345 --> 38:15.643
and which figured prominently
in her thesis...

38:15.881 --> 38:17.781
...Vicky had a chance encounter.

38:24.022 --> 38:24.750
Vicky.

38:25.324 --> 38:27.258
- Hello
- How are you?

38:27.392 --> 38:29.223
My goodness,
what are you doing here?

38:30.229 --> 38:32.356
Nothing.
Just doing some sketches.

38:32.497 --> 38:33.725
Oh, right.

38:34.433 --> 38:37.630
Well, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

38:37.769 --> 38:38.599
Disturb me, no.

38:38.737 --> 38:39.897
How could you disturb me?

38:40.872 --> 38:41.634
We never had a chance

38:41.773 --> 38:43.331
to say a proper good-bye.

38:45.244 --> 38:47.508
Well, you could have called me.

38:48.981 --> 38:52.246
I... Yeah, I debated it.

38:52.517 --> 38:54.985
But I didn't think
there was much point.

38:55.687 --> 38:59.589
But you never phoned,
not to say anything.

39:00.626 --> 39:01.558
"Thank you. It was fun."

39:01.693 --> 39:03.285
You don't make love

39:03.428 --> 39:05.521
to someone and then
never call them...

39:05.964 --> 39:07.727
...unless you were
greatly disappointed.

39:07.866 --> 39:08.924
Quite the opposite.

39:09.835 --> 39:10.733
But...

39:11.436 --> 39:13.404
...you have plans to marry...

39:13.505 --> 39:14.995
...and I thought it best
to stop anything

39:15.140 --> 39:17.768
before it led to a bad situation
for everyone.

39:18.510 --> 39:20.102
I'm only saying that we made love

39:20.245 --> 39:22.611
and you seemed to drop off
the face of the earth.

39:22.748 --> 39:27.344
I mean, I realize these
things don't mean much to you.

39:27.919 --> 39:30.888
To pursue matters would have
only caused you anxiety,

39:31.056 --> 39:32.523
for me,
a disappointment.

39:33.959 --> 39:35.586
I had the ability

39:35.794 --> 39:37.694
to hurt you after one night?

39:40.132 --> 39:41.895
Maria Elena used to say that...

39:43.068 --> 39:46.697
...only unfulfilled
love can be romantic.

39:48.907 --> 39:50.534
Right. Okay.

39:52.010 --> 39:55.844
Well, the truth is, you're
much more suited to Cristina.

39:57.316 --> 39:59.011
I've grown very fond
of Cristina.

40:01.320 --> 40:05.916
So, I'm very happy for you
and your husband-to-be.

40:07.793 --> 40:08.657
And I...

40:09.394 --> 40:10.986
...for you and Cristina.

40:14.099 --> 40:15.157
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

40:19.271 --> 40:20.238
And so the morning came

40:20.372 --> 40:22.966
when Vicky's husband-to-be
arrived from New York.

40:31.950 --> 40:34.077
Juan Antonio,
like certain creative men,

40:34.219 --> 40:35.846
needed always
to live with a woman...

40:36.021 --> 40:38.990
...and had invited Cristina to move
in with him, which she accepted.

41:01.012 --> 41:01.944
So you're with Global Enterprises?

41:02.080 --> 41:03.843
Tom Sutter's an old friend of mine.

41:03.982 --> 41:05.950
You know Tom Sutter? We play golf!

41:06.084 --> 41:07.551
You do? Well, I got some stories.

41:07.686 --> 41:08.710
Tom has never beaten me.

41:08.887 --> 41:10.980
Well, he's not the greatest
player in the world.

41:26.171 --> 41:27.229
My God.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.135
You're a whole different person here.

41:30.675 --> 41:31.801
Yeah? What does that mean?

41:32.778 --> 41:34.370
You were so into it.

41:35.447 --> 41:37.381
Well, am I not usually?

41:38.083 --> 41:39.380
Yeah, of course you are.

41:41.787 --> 41:43.118
I'm giving you a compliment.

41:46.358 --> 41:47.985
Maybe it's the Barcelona air.

41:49.528 --> 41:51.325
Come here, hold me. Hold me.

41:55.333 --> 41:56.197
You okay?

41:56.334 --> 41:58.666
Yeah.

41:59.304 --> 42:00.669
How's Cristina doing?

42:01.206 --> 42:03.970
She's already moved
in with some guy.

42:04.109 --> 42:04.905
That was quick.

42:05.043 --> 42:06.135
Don't tell me he's a bullfighter.

42:06.278 --> 42:07.142
No.

42:07.479 --> 42:08.810
Writer? Composer?

42:08.947 --> 42:11.677
Tortured pseudo- intellectual
and self-destructive?

42:11.783 --> 42:12.374
Yeah, I know.

42:12.517 --> 42:13.506
Sometimes she gets on my nerves

42:13.652 --> 42:16.246
with her crackpot love affairs.

42:16.521 --> 42:19.718
Look, I love her because
she's your friend...

42:19.858 --> 42:21.189
...but I've warned you about her.

42:21.326 --> 42:22.759
She's an unhappy person.

42:24.029 --> 42:25.462
She can't part with
that self-image

42:25.597 --> 42:27.030
of the oh-so-special woman...

42:27.165 --> 42:29.463
...the artist trying to find herself.

42:29.601 --> 42:33.731
I find her contempt for
normal values pretentious.

42:33.839 --> 42:35.033
It's a boring cliche.

42:35.173 --> 42:36.105
Well, men like her.

42:36.241 --> 42:37.674
She's pretty.

42:38.243 --> 42:41.644
And not exactly difficult
to maneuver into the sack.

42:41.947 --> 42:46.441
Now you, on the other hand,
took a little effort to get to bed.

42:49.287 --> 42:50.754
But it was worth the struggle.

42:50.922 --> 42:52.219
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:56.294 --> 42:57.761
Juan Antonio wants to take me

42:57.896 --> 43:00.330
to this old amusement park
he said I would love.

43:00.465 --> 43:04.128
I thought we could get lunch,
all of us...

43:04.269 --> 43:06.464
...then we could
all see it together.

43:07.339 --> 43:08.966
What, tomorrow for lunch?

43:09.074 --> 43:10.632
We can't. We have plans.

43:11.176 --> 43:14.668
No, we can always go boating
with Mark and Judy.

43:14.813 --> 43:16.178
I'd like to go with Cristina

43:16.314 --> 43:18.248
- and Juan Antonio.
- I really want to go boating.

43:18.383 --> 43:20.647
Yeah, that would be great.

43:20.986 --> 43:21.714
Tomorrow.

43:21.887 --> 43:22.649
Okay.

43:25.457 --> 43:27.049
The couples met for lunch
and during the

43:27.192 --> 43:29.990
course of conversation,
an awkward moment occurred.

43:31.630 --> 43:34.030
Juan Antonio, having warm
thoughts about Cristina,

43:34.165 --> 43:35.063
tried to brush his foot...

43:35.200 --> 43:38.692
...against hers under the table,
and accidentally brushed Vicky's.

43:46.444 --> 43:49.311
The amusement park was everything
Juan Antonio led them to believe.

43:49.814 --> 43:52.908
It was antique and charming,
and overlooked all of Barcelona.

44:14.005 --> 44:15.836
I see why you love your fiance.

44:15.974 --> 44:17.134
He's very charming.

44:17.275 --> 44:19.072
Yes, he's lovely.

44:19.344 --> 44:21.073
And very well suited to you.

44:22.614 --> 44:24.639
I don't think I like
the way you say that.

44:24.783 --> 44:28.310
I only mean you make a
comfortable couple in the best sense.

44:28.453 --> 44:29.715
You don't understand.

44:29.854 --> 44:31.651
I can't do anything about it now.

44:31.790 --> 44:35.658
I'm not saying the thought
hasn't crossed my mind, but...

44:35.794 --> 44:36.818
Vicky, please.

44:36.962 --> 44:38.987
We must not get into this
conversation again. All right?

44:39.130 --> 44:40.154
Things have moved on

44:40.298 --> 44:42.858
and I've developed real
feelings for Cristina.

44:43.668 --> 44:45.033
Then what?

44:45.170 --> 44:48.367
Why did you rub your foot
against mine under the table?

44:48.873 --> 44:51.205
- I didn't.
- Yes.

44:51.343 --> 44:53.402
- I didn't.
- When I looked over at you.

44:53.545 --> 44:55.536
No. If I did, it was a mistake.

44:55.747 --> 44:58.443
My intention was to touch Cristina.

45:00.986 --> 45:03.352
Okay, I'm sorry.

45:03.488 --> 45:04.955
I apologize for my mistake.

45:05.090 --> 45:07.251
I'm sorry, it was my mistake,
but listen.

45:07.392 --> 45:09.485
Listen... you are all set to enter

45:09.628 --> 45:11.892
a completely different life.

45:12.097 --> 45:13.792
A life you always wanted
with the man you love.

45:13.932 --> 45:16.230
Yes, goddamn it,
and then I met you...

45:16.368 --> 45:19.166
...and we had this ridiculously
irrational weekend together

45:19.304 --> 45:22.171
and now I don't know where I am.

45:22.374 --> 45:23.204
Please.

45:23.675 --> 45:27.839
I'm with Cristina and you're
getting married in two weeks, Vicky.

45:28.380 --> 45:31.213
I know. I know.
I know you're right.

45:31.549 --> 45:33.483
Cristina loves you.

45:34.085 --> 45:35.347
I would never...

45:35.487 --> 45:38.217
Yes, and Cristina
and I are a good fit.

45:38.356 --> 45:40.324
She speaks my language.

45:40.458 --> 45:41.049
You and l...

45:41.192 --> 45:43.592
- we'd be at each other's
throats in a month.

45:45.163 --> 45:45.390
All right?

45:45.530 --> 45:46.258
Yeah.

45:46.398 --> 45:49.128
Look. Maybe our paths will
cross again someday,

45:49.267 --> 45:50.529
under different circumstances.

45:50.669 --> 45:52.534
Who knows about life?

45:54.005 --> 45:54.801
Yeah. You're right.

45:54.939 --> 45:56.201
You're right, I'm an idiot.

45:56.841 --> 45:58.672
I don't know what
I expect to happen.

46:01.146 --> 46:03.842
And so the wedding day came
and Vicky married Doug.

46:04.683 --> 46:05.707
Cristina was there.

46:06.351 --> 46:09.081
She did not bring Juan Antonio,
who made an excuse.

46:11.022 --> 46:12.182
Following the ceremony,

46:12.457 --> 46:15.187
the bride and groom left for
a mini-honeymoon in Seville.

46:23.568 --> 46:24.432
Meanwhile, Cristina began to

46:24.569 --> 46:26.537
sense the possibility of
the kind of relationship

46:26.671 --> 46:27.831
she had always sought...

46:27.972 --> 46:29.963
...but in the past had eluded her.

46:31.242 --> 46:35.372
She was the lover of an exciting man,
an artist whose work she believed in.

46:36.748 --> 46:39.478
She was already thinking of herself
as a kind of expatriate...

46:39.751 --> 46:42.515
...not smothered by what she
believed to be America's puritanical

46:42.654 --> 46:44.087
and materialistic culture...

46:44.189 --> 46:45.588
...which she had little
patience for.

46:47.992 --> 46:49.892
She saw herself more a European soul,

46:50.028 --> 46:51.723
in tune with the
thinkers and artists...

46:51.863 --> 46:54.730
...she felt expressed
her tragic, romantic,

46:54.866 --> 46:56.493
freethinking view of life.

47:09.180 --> 47:11.239
With Juan Antonio's circle of friends,

47:11.382 --> 47:13.942
she hobnobbed with
creative people of all sorts.

47:14.619 --> 47:15.711
She loved their company

47:15.854 --> 47:18.823
and continued to experiment
with writing and taking pictures.

47:36.641 --> 47:40.042
- You have a good time?
- Yeah. Seville is breathtaking.

47:40.178 --> 47:41.406
We ran into some friends from New York,

47:41.546 --> 47:44.037
got to spend some time with them,
which was great.

47:44.182 --> 47:45.149
Uh, yeah, a-a-a little too much time.

47:45.283 --> 47:47.877
You're just angry because they beat
our brains out at bridge.

47:48.019 --> 47:49.782
- I don't like bridge.
- Me, either.

47:49.921 --> 47:52.412
- What is this?
- Swag. Your attention, please.

47:53.024 --> 47:55.492
Cristina and Juan Antonio
sent you this wedding gift.

47:55.627 --> 47:57.720
When I found out she was seriously
dating Juan Antonio,

47:57.862 --> 47:59.352
I couldn't believe it.

47:59.464 --> 48:01.796
Just what we need...
a Rorschach blot.

48:03.201 --> 48:04.566
I don't think I like it.

48:04.803 --> 48:06.430
We'll buy you one of Alejandro's.

48:57.055 --> 48:57.749
What?

48:58.323 --> 48:59.312
Maria Elena is...

48:59.457 --> 49:01.425
she tried to kill herself.

49:01.593 --> 49:02.287
What?

49:03.027 --> 49:03.959
Is she okay?

49:07.098 --> 49:09.066
Yes. Yes, I think so.

49:09.200 --> 49:10.360
I don't know. I have to go.

49:10.535 --> 49:11.559
Where are you going?

49:13.938 --> 49:15.132
I'm going to the hospital.

49:16.541 --> 49:17.701
Should I come with you?

49:18.810 --> 49:20.903
I don't think that would be
a good idea for her.

49:21.045 --> 49:22.012
She's a mess.

49:22.247 --> 49:24.875
Well, all right, well,
if you want me to come.

49:25.350 --> 49:26.180
- Okay, of course.
- Okay

49:26.317 --> 49:27.249
Of course.

49:28.620 --> 49:30.850
Juan Antonio hurried out
in the dead of night.

49:36.394 --> 49:38.089
Cristina tried
to go back to sleep,

49:38.463 --> 49:40.021
but had an uneasy feeling.

49:40.999 --> 49:44.730
She dozed restively,
but awoke at the darkest hour.

49:54.445 --> 49:56.310
I'm just up here making coffee!

49:56.981 --> 49:57.913
Is everything okay?

49:59.751 --> 50:01.514
Cristina, this is Maria Elena.

50:08.126 --> 50:09.024
I feel like such a fool.

50:09.160 --> 50:11.628
Here you have to speak English.

50:12.130 --> 50:12.653
Please.

50:12.797 --> 50:13.923
I'm embarrassed.

50:14.732 --> 50:15.494
Oh, no.

50:16.901 --> 50:18.163
Please, don't feel embarrassed.

50:18.303 --> 50:19.793
Can I get you anything at all?

50:20.905 --> 50:21.806
Vodka.

50:21.806 --> 50:24.673
Vodka?
You're going to have a vodka now?

50:25.009 --> 50:28.410
With all those pills you took?

50:28.546 --> 50:30.036
Are you crazy, or what?

50:30.181 --> 50:31.273
I want to take a shower,
Juan Antonio, can I?

50:31.416 --> 50:32.781
I want to get rid of these clothes.

50:32.917 --> 50:34.009
In English. In English.

50:34.152 --> 50:37.121
When you are here,
you have to speak English. All right?

50:37.255 --> 50:40.122
You want to take a shower,
you go there, in the guest room.

50:41.726 --> 50:43.785
So now I'm a guest in my own house?

50:43.895 --> 50:45.692
Yes. You are a guest.

50:46.264 --> 50:48.255
Go on, Maria Elena, please. Go on.

50:50.034 --> 50:52.628
There. You know where the room is.

50:54.472 --> 50:56.372
So... what's going on?

50:56.507 --> 51:00.273
- Nothing.
- Is everything okay?

51:00.478 --> 51:01.877
I think she's okay, yeah.

51:03.314 --> 51:04.178
I mean...

51:06.751 --> 51:11.085
...things didn't work out
for her in Madrid and...

51:12.156 --> 51:15.853
...she came back on the bus tonight,
alone.

51:17.462 --> 51:19.794
Her whole world looked black

51:19.931 --> 51:22.297
and all her plans had come
to nothing and...

51:23.301 --> 51:24.893
...she overdosed in the
bus terminal.

51:25.036 --> 51:26.333
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

51:26.471 --> 51:28.371
Yea. She has to stay with us.

51:28.573 --> 51:30.336
What? She's gonna stay with us?

51:30.608 --> 51:32.371
She has to stay with us.
I mean, she has no money.

51:32.510 --> 51:34.944
She has no one capable
of caring for her.

51:36.781 --> 51:39.113
I, I always...

51:40.018 --> 51:43.283
I was always her
connection to the real life.

51:43.921 --> 51:47.482
I understand, but, I mean,
how can she stay here?

51:48.192 --> 51:49.819
You know, I think...

51:50.228 --> 51:52.696
...she can't be trusted
to stay alone.

51:52.830 --> 51:53.489
That's the problem.

51:53.631 --> 51:55.064
I mean, even if...

51:55.566 --> 51:57.534
let me think... even if I...

51:58.302 --> 52:00.270
...if a place could
be worked out...

52:00.505 --> 52:02.405
Maybe she needs
psychiatric help.

52:03.041 --> 52:05.236
No. She's always had bad
experiences with doctors.

52:05.376 --> 52:07.901
I understand,
but where is she going to stay?

52:08.046 --> 52:08.876
In there.

52:11.649 --> 52:13.640
Well, how long is
she going to stay here?

52:14.786 --> 52:16.219
Cristina, I know...

52:17.855 --> 52:20.585
...this is not what you had in mind,
but she has to stay with us.

52:20.725 --> 52:22.192
- I understand.
- She has no one else.

52:22.326 --> 52:24.123
I understand.
It's only for a short time.

52:24.262 --> 52:25.957
A few months at most.

52:26.597 --> 52:28.394
She's staying for a few months?

52:28.633 --> 52:30.828
Listen, I've been
through this with her before.

52:31.803 --> 52:34.135
So... I mean, if...

52:34.305 --> 52:35.203
Shit.

52:38.443 --> 52:40.968
If you had only known
her when I first met her.

52:41.112 --> 52:45.014
I mean, her beauty...
...took your breath away.

52:45.149 --> 52:48.312
- Yes, I know.
- She was so talented, so brilliant...

52:48.453 --> 52:49.613
...she was so sensual.

52:49.754 --> 52:54.418
She chose me from a hundred men
ready to kill for her.

52:55.093 --> 52:56.424
We were both sure that...

52:57.195 --> 53:00.289
...our relation was perfect,
but there was something missing.

53:00.631 --> 53:04.499
You know, love requires
such a perfect balance.

53:04.635 --> 53:05.533
It's like the human body.

53:05.670 --> 53:08.161
It may turn out that you have

53:08.306 --> 53:09.864
all the vitamins and minerals,
but...

53:10.007 --> 53:15.172
...if there is a single,
tiny ingredient...

53:15.480 --> 53:22.409
...missing, like, like...
...salt, for example... one dies.

53:23.221 --> 53:24.051
Salt?

53:26.424 --> 53:27.220
Who is she?

53:29.961 --> 53:31.724
She is the woman I live with.

53:33.131 --> 53:36.532
You have to speak English around her.

53:36.667 --> 53:37.429
Please.

53:37.635 --> 53:38.294
Why? For her sake?

53:38.436 --> 53:40.904
Yes, exactly. Out of courtesy.

53:42.073 --> 53:43.540
I don't trust her, Juan Antonio.

53:44.242 --> 53:47.143
Her eyes are not one color.

53:47.912 --> 53:52.406
You always had paranoid ideas
about every woman I've ever known.

53:53.451 --> 53:54.611
She's pretty.

53:55.987 --> 53:57.818
Do you think she'll
be enough for you?

53:57.955 --> 54:02.858
Well, she's quite intelligent
and she is a free thinker, like you.

54:02.994 --> 54:03.756
Like me?

54:03.861 --> 54:04.486
Yes.

54:05.163 --> 54:07.256
You're still searching
for me in every woman.

54:07.565 --> 54:08.827
That is not true, Maria Elena.

54:08.966 --> 54:11.093
I was in Oviedo some weeks
ago with a woman

54:11.235 --> 54:13.169
who was the antithesis of you...

54:13.304 --> 54:15.568
...an American, and something

54:16.641 --> 54:19.132
beautiful happened with her.

54:19.277 --> 54:20.608
So you're mistaken.

54:20.745 --> 54:22.440
You'll always see to duplicate
what we had. You know it.

54:22.580 --> 54:25.071
In this house, speak English.

54:25.216 --> 54:26.274
That's all I ask. All right?

54:26.417 --> 54:27.611
Don't talk to me like that.

54:27.752 --> 54:31.518
Why are you getting
so angry at me?!

54:31.656 --> 54:34.682
Listen. Why were you thinking
about killing yourself?

54:34.825 --> 54:37.953
What a stupid idea did
cross on your mind!

54:38.062 --> 54:40.553
I mean, to try to kill yourself,
for Christ's sake!

54:41.399 --> 54:43.458
Stay here until you get
back on your feet...

54:43.601 --> 54:47.002
...and then I beg you, please,
get out of my life!

54:48.439 --> 54:50.634
We came so close to perfection,
you and I.

54:50.775 --> 54:53.573
- You're too damaged.
- And you love that.

54:54.312 --> 54:57.247
You've always liked my mood swings.

54:59.617 --> 55:01.551
But what was missing, Juan Antonio?

55:02.153 --> 55:03.347
What was missing?

55:03.821 --> 55:05.311
Speak English!

55:06.424 --> 55:07.550
I don't like her for you!

55:07.692 --> 55:08.716
I don't trust her.

55:08.893 --> 55:11.259
And you know I always
have your best interest.

55:12.430 --> 55:14.728
Not when you tried to kill me.

55:15.032 --> 55:18.058
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that. That small detail.

55:18.202 --> 55:24.732
I mean, you... are suspicious of her
because she is now my lover.

55:24.875 --> 55:25.899
It's so obvious.

55:26.043 --> 55:31.345
No, no. I see you so lost,
so confused, since we split up.

55:32.550 --> 55:35.417
For all your talk of swearing off
women and renouncing love...

55:35.686 --> 55:37.586
...to end up losing your head...

55:37.722 --> 55:41.522
...not for one, but two...
...American tourists.

55:57.708 --> 55:58.538
More coffee?

55:59.610 --> 56:00.440
Yes, please.

56:03.514 --> 56:04.344
I'm sorry.

56:06.284 --> 56:07.148
Here's sugar.

56:07.852 --> 56:08.716
No, thank you.

56:12.723 --> 56:15.317
I thought we could go for a ride
to the countryside later.

56:15.459 --> 56:17.927
I mean, the weather is beautiful.

56:19.530 --> 56:22.021
It's definitely going to rain later.

56:22.333 --> 56:23.357
In English.

56:23.834 --> 56:24.994
No, it's fine.

56:26.604 --> 56:27.935
You speak no Spanish?

56:28.439 --> 56:30.669
No. I studied Chinese.

56:32.643 --> 56:33.507
Chinese?

56:36.314 --> 56:37.246
Why?

56:37.915 --> 56:39.143
I thought it sounded pretty.

56:41.552 --> 56:42.849
Say something in Chinese.

56:44.989 --> 56:45.921
Me?

56:50.361 --> 56:51.385
How are you?

56:53.364 --> 56:54.888
You think that sounds pretty?

56:56.834 --> 56:58.301
Well, maybe not the way

56:58.436 --> 57:00.097
I'm pronouncing it, but...

57:01.739 --> 57:03.900
If you ask me,
Chinese sounds strident.

57:04.041 --> 57:05.599
It's like a drill to the head.

57:05.843 --> 57:07.470
Speak English, Maria Elena.

57:07.611 --> 57:09.738
You ever hear them in the kitchen
of a Chinese restaurant?

57:09.880 --> 57:10.812
It's so unpleasant.

57:10.948 --> 57:12.347
Maria Elena, enough.

57:12.550 --> 57:13.744
Speak English.

57:16.187 --> 57:17.381
I'm sorry. I am nervous today.

57:17.521 --> 57:18.886
I had bad dreams.

57:22.827 --> 57:23.794
Would you like to paint?

57:23.994 --> 57:25.325
Do you paint also?

57:25.930 --> 57:26.988
Do I paint, she asks.

57:27.131 --> 57:30.294
Ask him, ask him.
He stole everything from me.

57:30.434 --> 57:31.560
His whole style.

57:32.236 --> 57:34.136
She likes to make
up these stories.

57:34.472 --> 57:36.667
Your whole way
of seeing is mine.

57:37.041 --> 57:38.736
I'm not saying that you
were not influential.

57:38.876 --> 57:39.535
Influential?

57:39.677 --> 57:42.942
- Influential?
- Yes, but to say I stole your style...

57:43.080 --> 57:44.411
Hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite.

57:44.548 --> 57:46.948
To say I stole your style
is too delusional.

57:47.084 --> 57:50.281
It's okay. We painted side
by side for many years,

57:50.421 --> 57:52.514
and you adopted my vision
as your own.

57:52.656 --> 57:55.352
That's a tale you invented
and like to spread.

57:55.493 --> 57:56.653
But it's not true.

57:56.894 --> 57:58.327
She always had
problems with reality.

57:58.462 --> 58:00.828
I'm not going to get angry.

58:00.998 --> 58:02.488
I'm not going to get angry.

58:02.666 --> 58:04.065
What did they say in art school?

58:04.201 --> 58:05.964
That I was a genius. Right?

58:06.137 --> 58:07.900
I always encouraged your talent.

58:08.038 --> 58:09.630
I'm not talking about talent.

58:09.774 --> 58:10.741
I said genius.

58:10.875 --> 58:12.069
Genius.

58:13.077 --> 58:14.738
I came close to killing for you.

58:14.945 --> 58:17.470
You came close
to killing me... with a chair.

58:17.815 --> 58:19.282
I was defending myself.

58:19.417 --> 58:21.885
You had a razor
and you were drunk...

58:22.319 --> 58:23.479
...with a razor and raging!

58:23.621 --> 58:27.148
That was jealousy...
I was crazy for you and...

58:27.291 --> 58:28.485
...you betrayed me...
with Agustino's wife.

58:28.626 --> 58:32.687
With your eyes! With your eyes!

58:32.830 --> 58:33.694
You wanted to kill me
for looking?

58:33.831 --> 58:36.391
I don't want to talk
about that anymore, okay? It's over.

58:37.401 --> 58:40.768
I see you with someone
else now and I'm fine. I'm civil.

58:40.905 --> 58:42.236
What else do you want?

58:57.288 --> 58:58.346
As the days passed,

58:58.522 --> 59:01.514
Cristina observed Maria Elena
and Juan Antonio...

59:01.859 --> 59:04.054
...and found the heart
more puzzling than ever.

59:15.172 --> 59:17.265
Where were you? Writing?

59:17.441 --> 59:19.170
Yeah, I was trying to.

59:19.743 --> 59:21.005
I'm so curious.

59:21.245 --> 59:23.509
Does she really think
that you stole from her?

59:26.250 --> 59:29.481
Well, I guess I took...

59:30.054 --> 59:32.284
...more from her
than I like to admit.

59:33.257 --> 59:37.250
That's why I'm so sensitive
when she brings it up.

59:39.697 --> 59:40.994
I feel kind of sad.

59:41.232 --> 59:41.823
Why?

59:41.966 --> 59:44.696
Because I feel like
I'm never going to be able to...

59:45.202 --> 59:48.194
...influence you
or inspire you in any way.

59:48.339 --> 59:49.397
That's not true.

59:49.540 --> 59:50.336
It's how I feel.

59:50.474 --> 59:51.498
That's not true.

59:52.443 --> 59:56.004
I never heard the Scriab,
the Scriabin...

59:56.146 --> 59:58.910
...Piano Sonata until you played
the recordings for me

59:59.049 --> 01:00:00.778
and now I can't stop listening to it.

01:00:00.885 --> 01:00:01.249
No?

01:00:01.385 --> 01:00:02.443
No!

01:00:02.586 --> 01:00:04.986
Well, that makes me happy.

01:00:06.924 --> 01:00:07.686
What?

01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:11.625
Maybe it's not a good idea here.

01:00:11.862 --> 01:00:12.658
What?

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:15.658
She's been better lately...

01:00:16.233 --> 01:00:19.066
...and I don't
want to upset her.

01:00:20.371 --> 01:00:22.498
Of course, no. Okay.

01:00:28.946 --> 01:00:30.846
It was at Vicky's afternoon
language class,

01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:32.380
which she took several days a week...

01:00:32.516 --> 01:00:35.212
...to improve her Spanish,
that she met Ben...

01:00:35.452 --> 01:00:37.352
...a young man who couldn't
stop noticing her,

01:00:37.488 --> 01:00:39.251
and started to chat
her up each day.

01:00:41.258 --> 01:00:43.590
I can't believe they hired me
at the consulate.

01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:46.226
My Spanish is less than perfect,
to say the least.

01:00:46.363 --> 01:00:48.854
No, I think it's good.

01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:49.829
It's all right.

01:00:49.967 --> 01:00:52.561
But are you enjoying
your time in Barcelona?

01:00:53.871 --> 01:00:55.338
I would if I had more friends.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.834
Yesterday, I walked
from the beach up

01:00:57.975 --> 01:00:59.943
to Park Guell in search of Gaudi.

01:01:02.246 --> 01:01:03.235
You want to see a movie?

01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:04.477
A movie?

01:01:04.615 --> 01:01:06.242
Wednesday afternoon?

01:01:08.852 --> 01:01:09.876
Yeah.

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:13.750
The movie was a great
success and Ben proved

01:01:13.891 --> 01:01:15.518
to be very good company for Vicky.

01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:22.798
One afternoon, they ducked into
a store to buy some cherries...

01:01:22.933 --> 01:01:25.231
...and when the storekeeper took
a phone call in the back,

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:27.401
he couldn't resist taking her hand.

01:01:30.808 --> 01:01:32.571
No... don't.

01:01:33.143 --> 01:01:33.871
No?

01:01:34.845 --> 01:01:35.675
No.

01:01:36.647 --> 01:01:39.480
You do know that
I'm recently married.

01:01:39.617 --> 01:01:40.447
Yeah.

01:01:41.352 --> 01:01:43.013
I guess I was under
the impression that...

01:01:43.754 --> 01:01:46.348
...maybe you jumped into it
too quick and regret it?

01:01:46.457 --> 01:01:49.722
Regret? Have I implied that?

01:01:50.461 --> 01:01:51.826
Unless I read into it.

01:01:52.262 --> 01:01:52.557
No.

01:01:52.696 --> 01:01:55.324
I shouldn't tell you this.

01:01:55.466 --> 01:02:01.098
I was always someone who thought
I knew exactly what I wanted.

01:02:01.238 --> 01:02:02.262
But you didn't.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.903
Well, no.
I met somebody else and, uh...

01:02:07.845 --> 01:02:09.710
I'm not going to get
into that story.

01:02:10.214 --> 01:02:11.306
So, this guy you met?

01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:15.016
The guy is living
with my best friend.

01:02:15.386 --> 01:02:17.217
What am I talking about?

01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:21.415
When I hear myself, it's just crazy.

01:02:21.558 --> 01:02:24.527
I just married the guy I wanted.

01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:26.325
Did you?

01:02:27.064 --> 01:02:28.292
I thought so.

01:02:29.133 --> 01:02:31.693
So? What happened?

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.901
One goddamned weekend in Oviedo.

01:02:40.377 --> 01:02:41.844
Cristina, Juan Antonio

01:02:41.979 --> 01:02:44.106
and Maria Elena went riding
in the country.

01:02:44.982 --> 01:02:47.542
Maria Elena had decided they
would all cook a big dinner together

01:02:47.685 --> 01:02:49.915
and insisted
they pick fresh blackberries.

01:02:50.054 --> 01:02:51.214
Wait for me!

01:02:53.357 --> 01:02:55.052
Gives me vertigo!

01:02:59.129 --> 01:03:00.460
- This is the perfect spot.
- Here, like that.

01:03:00.597 --> 01:03:03.065
- Can you get some...
- Okay, here.

01:03:03.767 --> 01:03:05.098
What's wrong?

01:03:05.669 --> 01:03:08.160
What, what, what?
What happened?

01:03:08.505 --> 01:03:08.903
Wait, sit down.

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:11.473
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

01:03:12.242 --> 01:03:14.176
Is it your upper
or your lower?

01:03:15.512 --> 01:03:16.604
- Here.
- Here?

01:03:17.481 --> 01:03:18.277
Hold on.

01:03:21.518 --> 01:03:22.542
Wait, let me...

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:27.687
You want some aspirin?

01:03:27.991 --> 01:03:29.822
I have aspirin in my bag.

01:03:30.294 --> 01:03:31.625
Okay. You relax.

01:03:31.762 --> 01:03:32.786
I'll be right back.

01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:59.886
It's all in his head.

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:01.580
He has so much tension.

01:04:02.726 --> 01:04:05.058
To the world, he's carefree,
nothing matters,

01:04:05.195 --> 01:04:07.459
life is short,
with no purpose, kind of things.

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:10.897
But all his fear
just goes to his head.

01:04:17.374 --> 01:04:19.001
Do you know that
she plays piano?

01:04:20.344 --> 01:04:21.106
No...

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:23.170
...I didn't.

01:04:23.313 --> 01:04:24.871
Is that why you have
a piano in the house?

01:04:25.415 --> 01:04:27.679
I could have been
a concert pianist.

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:28.781
Yes, you could have.

01:04:28.919 --> 01:04:31.547
No one plays
Scarlatti like Maria Elena.

01:04:32.356 --> 01:04:33.948
She understands Scarlatti.

01:04:34.057 --> 01:04:34.853
Am I right?

01:04:35.793 --> 01:04:36.919
Do you play music?

01:04:37.895 --> 01:04:40.693
No. I just have to come
face to face with the fact...

01:04:40.831 --> 01:04:43.527
...that I am not gifted, you know?

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.902
I can appreciate art and
I love music, but...

01:04:47.738 --> 01:04:48.466
It's sad, really,

01:04:48.605 --> 01:04:51.665
because I feel like
I have a lot to express...

01:04:51.809 --> 01:04:54.004
...but I am not gifted.

01:04:54.678 --> 01:04:56.111
But you do have talent.

01:04:56.914 --> 01:04:58.245
- No.
- Yes.

01:04:58.448 --> 01:05:00.109
What's my talent?

01:05:00.818 --> 01:05:02.251
You take beautiful photographs.

01:05:02.386 --> 01:05:02.852
That's true.

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:06.046
She always takes pictures that
she hides from me.

01:05:06.223 --> 01:05:09.283
That's because they're nothing.

01:05:09.426 --> 01:05:11.360
How do you know I take pictures?

01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:13.088
I found them in your luggage.

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.521
You went through my luggage?

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:18.097
Of course I went through your luggage.

01:05:18.235 --> 01:05:20.066
First night I was in the house,
I didn't trust you.

01:05:20.204 --> 01:05:22.604
I didn't believe you were
who you said you were.

01:05:23.307 --> 01:05:27.004
I wanted to know who was really
sharing the bed of my ex-husband.

01:05:27.744 --> 01:05:28.506
What?!

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:30.309
Who knew what I would find?

01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:32.915
How could I be sure you were
not going to hurt me?

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.275
After all, I had thoughts
of killing you.

01:05:43.827 --> 01:05:46.091
So here are a few more.

01:05:47.497 --> 01:05:49.795
Don't say you like
them if you don't.

01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:52.260
- What are you talking about?
- They are beautiful!

01:05:52.669 --> 01:05:54.136
- You see?
- Look at this.

01:05:55.372 --> 01:05:55.963
The next day,

01:05:56.106 --> 01:05:58.438
Maria Elena went out
photographing with Cristina.

01:05:58.775 --> 01:06:00.208
She had a superb eye and knew

01:06:00.344 --> 01:06:01.834
a lot about the art
of photography...

01:06:01.979 --> 01:06:02.911
...and taught Cristina much about

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:05.446
the aesthetics and
subtleties of picture taking.

01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:07.816
She advised her to get rid
of her digital camera

01:06:07.951 --> 01:06:10.317
and use an old one,
for more interesting results.

01:06:10.821 --> 01:06:12.686
She said it was important
to have a darkroom,

01:06:12.956 --> 01:06:14.947
and she would set one up
in the basement for Cristina...

01:06:15.092 --> 01:06:18.027
...and teach her various techniques
of developing her own pictures.

01:06:25.202 --> 01:06:26.226
They photographed everything,

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:29.032
from silly-looking dogs
to grim-faced children.

01:06:29.973 --> 01:06:32.498
But the best subject
was Maria Elena herself.

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:01.127
Shopping one afternoon,

01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:04.796
Vicky and Doug ran into
Adam Tabachnick and Sally.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:06.336
Adam was in the same business Doug

01:07:06.476 --> 01:07:07.568
was in and they were friendly...

01:07:07.711 --> 01:07:08.735
...although in New York,

01:07:08.879 --> 01:07:10.369
they did not spend a lot
of time together.

01:07:10.547 --> 01:07:12.037
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

01:07:14.284 --> 01:07:16.445
Any program on TV,
obviously anything live,

01:07:16.586 --> 01:07:18.781
you can play back on your computer.

01:07:19.156 --> 01:07:22.853
So I'm on a flight to Tokyo,
40,000 feet up in the air...

01:07:22.993 --> 01:07:26.292
...and I am watching the Mets,
live, on my laptop.

01:07:26.463 --> 01:07:28.158
It's amazing.
You're never out of touch.

01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:30.232
We'll have the new house wired
for everything.

01:07:30.367 --> 01:07:33.234
I'm looking at those new
Japanese high-definition TVs.

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:35.600
You have to have my guy do
your installation.

01:07:35.739 --> 01:07:37.707
He's a genius with computers.

01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:38.466
I'll get his card.

01:07:38.608 --> 01:07:40.007
We just did our place in Greenwich.

01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:44.102
We have this wonderful decorator
you should use.

01:07:44.247 --> 01:07:47.375
He's creative,
but he knows when to back off.

01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:51.949
We did it modern, with just
a splash of antiques here and there.

01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:54.717
I love combining the two,
but God, the prices.

01:07:54.858 --> 01:07:57.850
You have any idea what
a good size oriental rug costs?

01:07:58.061 --> 01:07:58.891
She's right.

01:07:59.229 --> 01:08:01.459
Actually, there's an old joke.

01:08:01.898 --> 01:08:03.832
"A hundred thousand
for a Persian rug?

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:19.345
Life continued predictably
for Vicky and Doug...

01:08:19.549 --> 01:08:20.607
...until one afternoon,

01:08:20.951 --> 01:08:23.010
when an unpredictable
moment occurred.

01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:37.064
Several days later,

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.792
Judy asked Vicky to
meet her privately,

01:08:38.935 --> 01:08:41.028
away from the house,
to have coffee.

01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:43.469
What happened the other day.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.973
I... don't want you to get
the wrong idea.

01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:48.475
It's really none of my business.

01:08:48.612 --> 01:08:51.604
I'm not having an affair
with Mark's partner.

01:08:51.948 --> 01:08:53.745
I'm not.

01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:55.852
No, I didn't think you were.

01:08:57.154 --> 01:08:59.384
Not that I haven't had fantasies of...

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:03.948
...someone coming along and
taking me out of my situation.

01:09:04.428 --> 01:09:08.694
But the fantasies are not Jay Lewis.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:11.697
Even though he would like that.
He would.

01:09:12.502 --> 01:09:14.993
Taking you out of your situation?

01:09:17.607 --> 01:09:21.270
I haven't been in love with Mark...

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:22.575
...for years.

01:09:22.679 --> 01:09:26.911
I love him,
but I'm not in love with him.

01:09:27.818 --> 01:09:28.944
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:32.821
It's funny. I just made...

01:09:34.157 --> 01:09:36.682
...I just made the same speech
to my shrink.

01:09:39.162 --> 01:09:40.527
Well, what does your shrink say?

01:09:42.599 --> 01:09:43.997
He says...

01:09:45.135 --> 01:09:47.865
...that I'm too frightened
to act and that...

01:09:49.139 --> 01:09:51.573
...l'm looking for some kind
of magical solution...

01:09:51.707 --> 01:09:53.971
...which is unrealistic.

01:09:54.111 --> 01:09:58.514
And an affair is not the answer.

01:09:58.648 --> 01:10:01.412
I'm sorry to be laying all
of this on you...

01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:04.315
...but I was so humiliated
when you saw us.

01:10:04.988 --> 01:10:06.615
I'm just...

01:10:06.823 --> 01:10:07.619
Look, you mustn't feel that

01:10:07.757 --> 01:10:10.555
you have to
explain yourself to me.

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:15.591
Mark is great.

01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:20.664
I'm sure any...

01:10:21.505 --> 01:10:25.566
...any dissatisfaction I have
is my own problem.

01:10:25.942 --> 01:10:27.273
I'm just...

01:10:29.546 --> 01:10:33.004
I can't leave him and I know
that I never will.

01:10:36.019 --> 01:10:37.008
Why not?

01:10:39.389 --> 01:10:40.947
I just... I can't.

01:10:41.358 --> 01:10:43.383
I'm too scared.

01:10:45.629 --> 01:10:47.620
The moment's passed.

01:11:05.649 --> 01:11:07.173
It's so apparent to me that you

01:11:07.317 --> 01:11:09.012
and Juan Antonio
are still in love...

01:11:09.152 --> 01:11:10.346
...when I see you together.

01:11:10.954 --> 01:11:13.582
Our love will last forever.

01:11:13.723 --> 01:11:15.850
It's forever,
but it just doesn't work.

01:11:16.193 --> 01:11:18.161
That's why it will always
be romantic...

01:11:18.728 --> 01:11:20.787
because it cannot be complete.

01:11:20.997 --> 01:11:23.295
Well, maybe it can't be
complete because,

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.528
you know, I'm getting in the way or,
I don't know. I feel like...

01:11:26.736 --> 01:11:27.930
- No. Before you...
...if l...

01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:31.201
...before you, we used to
cause each other so much pain,

01:11:31.341 --> 01:11:32.501
so much suffering.

01:11:32.776 --> 01:11:34.641
Without you, all this would
not be possible.

01:11:35.345 --> 01:11:35.970
You know why?

01:11:36.112 --> 01:11:37.875
Because you are
the missing ingredient.

01:11:38.515 --> 01:11:41.450
You are like the tint that,
added to a palette,

01:11:41.585 --> 01:11:42.950
makes the color beautiful.

01:11:43.753 --> 01:11:46.517
Aren't you and Juan Antonio
tempted to make love?

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:50.391
I feel like... I don't know.

01:11:50.527 --> 01:11:53.291
At the end of our marriage,
we didn't.

01:11:53.563 --> 01:11:56.031
But I have to say those feelings
are coming back now,

01:11:56.566 --> 01:11:57.464
thanks to you...

01:11:57.867 --> 01:12:00.131
...in a new and deeper way.

01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:02.103
I wouldn't be upset about it.

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:03.331
I'd never want to get in the way.

01:12:03.473 --> 01:12:05.168
It wouldn't upset me at all.

01:12:05.308 --> 01:12:06.673
I know you wouldn't be upset.

01:12:07.077 --> 01:12:09.944
The same way
I get this warm feeling...

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.947
...when I hear you both locked
in passion every night.

01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:16.177
I listen, and I'm happy.

01:12:18.154 --> 01:12:20.145
Was Cristina okay with
it when Maria Elena

01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:22.451
and Juan Antonio made
love one afternoon?

01:12:23.126 --> 01:12:24.753
Beforehand, she gave them
both her blessing,

01:12:24.894 --> 01:12:26.418
but then had mixed feelings.

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:28.395
She was not as open-minded

01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:29.998
as she had always
imagined herself...

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:31.764
...and the thought of the
two of them in bed,

01:12:31.901 --> 01:12:35.302
and inevitably full of intensity,
caused her some conflict.

01:12:35.839 --> 01:12:37.704
In the end, she gradually relaxed...

01:12:37.841 --> 01:12:39.638
...and let herself go
with the flow of things,

01:12:39.976 --> 01:12:41.534
a tolerance she was proud of.

01:12:43.313 --> 01:12:44.780
At first it did bother me,

01:12:44.914 --> 01:12:47.781
but then I started to think about all
these standard, accepted cliches of love

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:49.680
What's right, what's wrong,

01:12:49.819 --> 01:12:53.380
what's appropriate according to
the "appropriate police".

01:12:53.523 --> 01:12:55.718
You see how screwed up most
relationships are.

01:12:55.859 --> 01:12:57.793
So what you're saying
is you're sharing a man.

01:12:57.927 --> 01:12:59.417
You're like a Mormon wife.

01:12:59.562 --> 01:13:01.154
I know it sounds strange,

01:13:01.298 --> 01:13:03.391
but we all contribute to
the relationship

01:13:03.533 --> 01:13:04.591
and we're really nourished by it.

01:13:04.734 --> 01:13:06.463
But if everyone did that,
society couldn't function.

01:13:06.603 --> 01:13:07.365
Oh, come on!

01:13:07.504 --> 01:13:08.869
Let's not get into one
of those turgid,

01:13:09.005 --> 01:13:11.667
categorical imperative arguments.
Whatever works.

01:13:11.808 --> 01:13:12.900
- Maria Elena says there are
- Whatever works?

01:13:13.043 --> 01:13:14.772
many truths in life not just one.

01:13:14.911 --> 01:13:17.209
I don't know. I mean...
Could you live like that?

01:13:17.414 --> 01:13:20.281
Well, I've never had Cristina's...

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:24.479
- What? Her lack of structure?
- It's very structured. Actually.

01:13:24.621 --> 01:13:26.088
Her courage. I never had her courage.

01:13:26.222 --> 01:13:27.416
Her courage?

01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:30.021
Next thing, she'll be going to
bed with Maria Elena...

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.824
...and glorifying it as some kind of
superior alternative lifestyle.

01:13:34.964 --> 01:13:36.556
I have gone to bed with her.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.228
- No!
- Yeah.

01:13:38.601 --> 01:13:39.363
When?

01:13:39.903 --> 01:13:42.701
Well, Juan Antonio
and Maria Elena

01:13:42.839 --> 01:13:44.067
made this darkroom for me.

01:13:44.207 --> 01:13:45.799
They're pushing me
to take photographs

01:13:45.942 --> 01:13:47.671
and I'm getting pretty good.

01:13:48.244 --> 01:13:48.835
Believe it or not,

01:13:48.978 --> 01:13:50.445
I'm getting much more confident.

01:13:51.281 --> 01:13:53.511
And we were down there
in the darkroom.

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:58.314
And I was working on some
of my photographs, things...

01:13:58.655 --> 01:14:01.089
...I wouldn't have done if
she hadn't inspired me.

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:07.988
And it happened very naturally
for both of us.

01:15:09.692 --> 01:15:10.784
You weren't nervous?

01:15:11.161 --> 01:15:14.790
No, it was very
loving and gentle.

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:17.828
- Did you enjoy it?
- I did.

01:15:20.837 --> 01:15:22.668
It was just the one time?

01:15:22.806 --> 01:15:25.604
Yeah. I mean, it just happened,
you know?

01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:29.936
I'm not planning on making
a habit out of it, necessarily.

01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:33.708
But if you enjoyed it...

01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:35.340
I did, I did at the time.

01:15:35.485 --> 01:15:37.419
- Did you tell Juan Antonio?
- Yeah. Of course.

01:15:37.554 --> 01:15:38.748
There's nothing to hide.

01:15:39.088 --> 01:15:41.318
Would you say, then, you are
a bisexual?

01:15:41.424 --> 01:15:43.449
No... I see no reason
to label everything.

01:15:43.593 --> 01:15:45.151
I'm me! You know.

01:15:45.295 --> 01:15:47.160
I've slept with
Juan Antonio since

01:15:47.297 --> 01:15:49.561
and enjoyed that
experience very much.

01:15:49.966 --> 01:15:51.263
It's a great story.

01:15:53.069 --> 01:15:56.402
Yea. That's a... great story.

01:15:57.807 --> 01:16:01.368
Look, I don't set myself up
as a judge, so...

01:16:05.048 --> 01:16:05.946
What are you thinking?

01:16:08.818 --> 01:16:09.842
Oh, I don't know.

01:16:10.587 --> 01:16:12.384
How quickly time passes.

01:16:13.389 --> 01:16:15.084
Summer's almost over.

01:16:16.359 --> 01:16:17.758
We're going home soon.

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:22.860
I thought you were
still dwelling on...

01:16:22.999 --> 01:16:24.364
...your friend's little tale

01:16:24.501 --> 01:16:26.196
of lust in the darkroom.

01:16:28.404 --> 01:16:29.928
And speaking of darkrooms...

01:16:59.135 --> 01:17:00.067
Over the next weeks,

01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:03.263
Cristina became more and more sure
of herself as a photographer.

01:17:03.606 --> 01:17:06.302
Both Juan Antonio and
Maria Elena contributed ideas

01:17:06.442 --> 01:17:08.171
and support when
she had doubts.

01:17:08.745 --> 01:17:09.871
Thanks to their encouragement,

01:17:10.013 --> 01:17:10.741
photography was becoming

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.745
a productive interest in her life.

01:17:13.416 --> 01:17:15.577
By now, she and Juan Antonio

01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:18.050
and Maria Elena had become lovers.

01:17:31.167 --> 01:17:34.261
Everything seemed perfectly balanced,
perfectly in tune.

01:17:34.938 --> 01:17:37.304
Maria Elena was calm and relaxed.

01:17:37.807 --> 01:17:39.399
Juan Antonio was
going through a very

01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:41.237
creative period with his painting.

01:17:42.278 --> 01:17:43.609
It was only Cristina,

01:17:43.813 --> 01:17:45.838
as the last days
of summer expired...

01:17:46.115 --> 01:17:48.606
...who began to experience an old,
familiar stirring...

01:17:49.152 --> 01:17:51.245
...a growing restlessness
that she dreaded,

01:17:51.454 --> 01:17:53.115
but recognized only too well.

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.987
Suddenly, thoughts started
taking precedence over feelings.

01:17:58.361 --> 01:18:00.829
Thoughts and questions
about life and love.

01:18:00.897 --> 01:18:03.161
And, as much as she tried
to resist these ideas,

01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:04.925
she could not get them
from her mind.

01:18:05.902 --> 01:18:07.494
Finally summoning her resolve...

01:18:07.737 --> 01:18:08.965
...one evening after dinner,

01:18:09.105 --> 01:18:11.539
she made an announcement
that surprised everyone.

01:18:11.874 --> 01:18:13.102
I don't want what
my parents had.

01:18:13.242 --> 01:18:15.608
I don't want
what I had before I came here.

01:18:15.745 --> 01:18:16.643
I know that.

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:19.873
But I know I can't
live like this forever.

01:18:20.016 --> 01:18:20.948
Did I tell you or not?

01:18:21.084 --> 01:18:23.314
Okay.

01:18:23.886 --> 01:18:26.013
- What do you want?
- I want something different.

01:18:27.056 --> 01:18:27.818
What?

01:18:28.091 --> 01:18:31.219
I don't know.
Not this.

01:18:31.928 --> 01:18:33.054
There is no answer,
Cristina.

01:18:33.196 --> 01:18:34.527
Don't you understand?

01:18:34.664 --> 01:18:35.858
She's gotten what she wanted.

01:18:35.999 --> 01:18:37.899
She wants something else.

01:18:38.034 --> 01:18:39.365
This isn't enough for her.
It's like an illness.

01:18:39.502 --> 01:18:40.560
Nothing will ever be enough
for her.

01:18:40.703 --> 01:18:43.365
Don't get so upset please.
And can you speak English.

01:18:43.506 --> 01:18:44.564
I can't understand you.

01:18:44.707 --> 01:18:47.073
This girl will never
be satisfied with anything.

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:48.905
Speak English
so she can understand us.

01:18:49.045 --> 01:18:49.909
I knew you would use us.

01:18:50.046 --> 01:18:52.446
I knew you would use us.
And you used us.

01:18:52.615 --> 01:18:53.582
I knew it.

01:18:54.917 --> 01:18:56.248
I knew it! I knew it.

01:18:56.386 --> 01:18:57.410
Enough.

01:18:57.553 --> 01:19:00.989
Speak English, please,
so she can understand. All right?

01:19:01.991 --> 01:19:02.753
Enough.

01:19:03.793 --> 01:19:06.660
Chronic dissatisfaction,
that's what you have.

01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:08.828
Chronic dissatisfaction.

01:19:09.232 --> 01:19:10.199
Big sickness.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.464
Big sickness.

01:19:12.935 --> 01:19:13.924
That's not it, Maria Elena.

01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.331
That's not it.

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:16.631
- It's simply that...
- Look at me.

01:19:16.773 --> 01:19:18.468
Do you know how much we love you?

01:19:18.641 --> 01:19:20.074
Yeah. And I love you both.

01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:23.474
- No, you don't!
- It has nothing to do with that!

01:19:23.613 --> 01:19:24.739
You spoiled little shit.

01:19:24.881 --> 01:19:26.246
Spoiled little shit.

01:19:26.382 --> 01:19:29.840
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew it.

01:19:31.054 --> 01:19:32.681
Shut up now, please.

01:19:32.822 --> 01:19:33.413
Shut up now.

01:19:33.556 --> 01:19:35.456
It's simply that she hasn't
met the right person yet.

01:19:35.591 --> 01:19:38.355
When she does find the right person
not you or me...

01:19:38.494 --> 01:19:42.362
...this whole thing
about finding peace

01:19:42.498 --> 01:19:44.830
and happiness will pass.

01:19:44.967 --> 01:19:49.097
- That's not it.
- Okay, fine.

01:19:49.539 --> 01:19:50.870
Where will you go, Cristina?

01:19:51.274 --> 01:19:55.005
I just have to get out
of here for a few weeks...

01:19:55.144 --> 01:19:57.476
I'm, just got to clear my head.

01:19:57.613 --> 01:20:02.209
It's not... This is all my... problem.
It has nothing to do with you.

01:20:02.719 --> 01:20:03.583
Come here.

01:20:09.425 --> 01:20:10.255
Let's be...

01:20:12.028 --> 01:20:16.727
...thankful for all the good times
that we've spent together. All right?

01:20:16.866 --> 01:20:21.963
And remember each other
with respect...

01:20:23.506 --> 01:20:25.064
...and love and affection.

01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:36.080
Cristina told all that
had happened to Vicky...

01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:39.186
...and said she was going to France
for a few weeks to think things out.

01:20:39.722 --> 01:20:40.780
She would return to pick her up,

01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:42.686
so they could go back to
New York together.

01:20:50.633 --> 01:20:52.533
So it's been Juan Antonio
all this time?

01:20:52.668 --> 01:20:54.158
I'm not going to do anything.

01:20:54.303 --> 01:20:55.600
Forget I said...

01:20:55.738 --> 01:20:58.468
I just needed to tell someone
and we've become close.

01:20:58.608 --> 01:21:01.042
- Why don't you act on it?
- Act now?

01:21:01.177 --> 01:21:06.046
What, break up with Doug,
who's a really sweet guy...

01:21:06.282 --> 01:21:08.842
...who married me in good faith,
for... for what?

01:21:08.985 --> 01:21:13.251
For a bohemian Spanish painter
with a passionate tie...

01:21:13.389 --> 01:21:16.756
...to an ex-wife who probably
doesn't even share my feelings,

01:21:16.893 --> 01:21:17.757
if he ever did?

01:21:17.894 --> 01:21:22.854
So... Oh, God, who am I kidding?
I, but the, the dream is exciting.

01:21:22.999 --> 01:21:25.559
If I were you,
I wouldn't waste another minute.

01:21:25.701 --> 01:21:26.497
I'd get on it.

01:21:26.636 --> 01:21:27.796
Get on what?

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:29.301
You're in love with him.

01:21:30.206 --> 01:21:32.766
Do something,
or the years will pass by

01:21:32.909 --> 01:21:34.740
and you will be sorry, Vicky.

01:21:34.877 --> 01:21:35.969
No, no. What are you saying?

01:21:36.112 --> 01:21:39.548
I, eh, look, eh,
I can't risk everything.

01:21:39.682 --> 01:21:44.779
If, if Juan Antonio had never existed,
I'd be fine with Doug.

01:21:44.921 --> 01:21:47.719
- Just, you'd... Just fine? Just fine?
- Yeah, as I planned.

01:21:48.191 --> 01:21:49.419
How, how blunt do you want me to be?

01:21:49.559 --> 01:21:52.960
When I look at Doug, I see Mark.

01:21:53.262 --> 01:21:56.163
You're using me to rewrite
your own history.

01:21:57.733 --> 01:21:59.564
Despite Vicky's protestations...

01:21:59.802 --> 01:22:01.360
...Judy was possessed
with finding a way

01:22:01.504 --> 01:22:03.472
to bring her and
Juan Antonio together...

01:22:03.773 --> 01:22:04.831
...and prevailed upon her friend,

01:22:04.974 --> 01:22:07.033
Gabriella, who was a figure
in the art world...

01:22:07.176 --> 01:22:10.543
...to throw a party and
invite Vicky and Juan Antonio.

01:22:11.747 --> 01:22:14.443
Meanwhile, as predicted,
without Cristina...

01:22:14.617 --> 01:22:16.084
...the relationship
between Juan Antonio

01:22:16.219 --> 01:22:18.779
and Maria Elena had gone back to
its old destructiveness.

01:22:18.921 --> 01:22:20.889
I devote all my time
to you-pampering you,

01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:23.423
nursing your tics and phobias.

01:22:23.693 --> 01:22:24.625
My work suffers.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.125
It's not my fault.

01:22:26.262 --> 01:22:27.490
It's not my fault that your

01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:30.155
work has gone to shit and
that you don't mature.

01:22:30.299 --> 01:22:33.029
Do you know what it is like
for me to see...

01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:36.696
...that you will never
realize your full potential?

01:22:36.839 --> 01:22:39.501
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone, please!

01:22:39.642 --> 01:22:41.837
As had happened before
by mutual consent,

01:22:41.978 --> 01:22:43.411
Maria Elena packed her things...

01:22:43.546 --> 01:22:45.377
...and moved out of
Juan Antonio's house.

01:23:00.897 --> 01:23:03.331
I think he's sweet.
He just, he owns...

01:23:03.833 --> 01:23:04.993
He gets in very close.

01:23:05.101 --> 01:23:06.932
He's a close talker.

01:23:07.103 --> 01:23:08.229
He's a close talker.

01:23:09.906 --> 01:23:11.203
That's probably
why he's so successful.

01:23:12.608 --> 01:23:16.510
I was telling her in the car
ride over here that I'm very...

01:23:16.646 --> 01:23:18.546
I think he'll be a great
contact for me.

01:23:18.648 --> 01:23:19.945
I'm going to check out the food.

01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:21.674
Does anyone want anything?

01:23:24.921 --> 01:23:25.751
He gets in your face.

01:23:25.888 --> 01:23:28.322
He'll get a little close, but not...

01:23:34.864 --> 01:23:35.660
Hello.

01:23:39.502 --> 01:23:41.367
Oh. Hello.

01:23:42.238 --> 01:23:43.364
I'm surprised to see you.

01:23:46.842 --> 01:23:50.278
As am I to see you.
I didn't think you liked parties.

01:23:50.546 --> 01:23:53.310
Gabriella insisted
I come and she's an old friend.

01:23:55.251 --> 01:23:58.186
You know that Cristina and
I are no longer together, right?

01:23:58.321 --> 01:23:59.253
Yes.

01:24:00.222 --> 01:24:02.281
So now you're
just with your ex-wife?

01:24:02.858 --> 01:24:04.382
No, Maria Elena is gone as well.

01:24:05.795 --> 01:24:06.591
For now.

01:24:07.997 --> 01:24:10.329
It's funny. Maria Elena and I...

01:24:11.233 --> 01:24:13.599
...are meant for each other and
not meant for each other.

01:24:14.937 --> 01:24:15.869
It's a contradiction.

01:24:16.339 --> 01:24:19.775
In order to understand it,
you need a poet, like my father.

01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:21.834
Because I don't.

01:24:26.215 --> 01:24:27.113
How about you?

01:24:27.516 --> 01:24:29.279
All goes well with your husband?

01:24:29.418 --> 01:24:31.943
Oh, yes, he's wonderful.

01:24:32.254 --> 01:24:33.084
He's terrific.

01:24:33.222 --> 01:24:36.248
I'm quite delighted with
the way things turned out.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.822
Why don't I believe you?

01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:44.190
Don't become flirtatious.

01:24:45.067 --> 01:24:47.331
I realize your bed is empty now...

01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:49.597
...and you always had
a little yen for me,

01:24:49.739 --> 01:24:52.367
but we're preparing to leave
by the weekend, so...

01:24:52.508 --> 01:24:53.736
Meet me for lunch.

01:24:56.979 --> 01:24:59.345
I'm too scared.

01:25:03.019 --> 01:25:03.815
What?

01:25:04.587 --> 01:25:06.612
You're breaking up, Tom.

01:25:07.423 --> 01:25:08.481
You're breaking up.

01:25:09.425 --> 01:25:10.289
Where are you?

01:25:11.694 --> 01:25:13.025
Okay. That's better.

01:25:13.295 --> 01:25:13.818
That's better.

01:25:13.963 --> 01:25:15.453
Just try to stand still.

01:25:16.732 --> 01:25:17.892
Can you hear me?

01:25:18.567 --> 01:25:22.059
We have to get
a bird for Mark and Judy.

01:25:22.304 --> 01:25:23.771
No. We can't get them a bird.

01:25:23.906 --> 01:25:25.134
- Why not?
- It's ridiculous.

01:25:25.274 --> 01:25:26.172
They're beautiful.

01:25:26.275 --> 01:25:27.867
I always wanted a bird.

01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:29.307
You know, when we get home,

01:25:29.445 --> 01:25:32.107
I'd love to get a bird
for the new house.

01:25:32.648 --> 01:25:33.342
Yeah?

01:25:33.482 --> 01:25:36.883
Yeah. And I'm leaning towards
Bedford Hills.

01:25:37.086 --> 01:25:37.677
What do you think?

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.310
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.917
Hold on.

01:25:43.125 --> 01:25:43.819
Hello.

01:25:44.326 --> 01:25:46.123
Spend tomorrow afternoon with me.

01:25:48.164 --> 01:25:49.153
No. It's not possible.

01:25:49.298 --> 01:25:51.732
We're preparing to
leave by the weekend.

01:25:52.134 --> 01:25:55.626
Be on the corner of
Calle Tiles in Pedralbes.

01:25:55.771 --> 01:25:58.899
And... I'll drive by and pick
you up at noon.

01:26:00.443 --> 01:26:02.638
No. I... You're wasting your time.

01:26:02.778 --> 01:26:03.904
I can't talk now.

01:26:04.613 --> 01:26:06.513
Look... I'm not the kind of man

01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:10.107
who would try to come between
a husband and wife. I'm not...

01:26:10.252 --> 01:26:13.949
But Judy Nash called me
and tells me you are not happy.

01:26:14.256 --> 01:26:17.623
That you are actually more in love
with me than the man you married.

01:26:18.694 --> 01:26:19.422
I can't talk.

01:26:32.274 --> 01:26:34.367
Hey, babe. What do you think?

01:26:35.544 --> 01:26:36.374
Who was that?

01:26:37.613 --> 01:26:38.514
On the phone.

01:26:38.514 --> 01:26:41.847
Oh, it was my, uh, language teacher.

01:26:45.254 --> 01:26:45.777
He wants me to have

01:26:45.921 --> 01:26:48.481
a good-bye lunch with
him tomorrow at noon.

01:26:49.592 --> 01:26:50.058
That's perfect.

01:26:50.192 --> 01:26:52.353
I'm going to play golf with
Mark in the morning.

01:28:03.199 --> 01:28:04.291
Well, this is...

01:28:07.303 --> 01:28:09.828
I've been working
on these ones lately.

01:28:14.443 --> 01:28:16.070
They're very overwhelming. Oh, my God.

01:28:17.546 --> 01:28:19.537
It's very hard to explain a painting.

01:28:19.682 --> 01:28:22.674
You don't have to. It's fascinating.

01:28:22.818 --> 01:28:26.254
This one, actually,
should be the other way around.

01:28:29.792 --> 01:28:31.623
No, I like it very much.

01:28:31.927 --> 01:28:35.192
Can I...
can I be frank about something?

01:28:35.331 --> 01:28:35.820
Yeah.

01:28:35.965 --> 01:28:39.128
This one. It's...

01:28:39.368 --> 01:28:41.529
There's something
very frightening about it.

01:28:42.738 --> 01:28:43.898
That one is Maria Elena's.

01:28:44.039 --> 01:28:47.065
Well, that explains it.
It's very chaotic.

01:28:48.143 --> 01:28:50.805
Erratic, almost. But...

01:28:51.447 --> 01:28:53.608
Oh, God, what am I doing here?

01:28:54.183 --> 01:28:56.151
I don't know what I expect to happen.

01:28:56.552 --> 01:29:00.454
It's been a long time since
we made love that night in Oviedo.

01:29:01.156 --> 01:29:03.147
I've thought about it many, many times.

01:29:03.292 --> 01:29:04.281
I'm sure you weren't thinking about it

01:29:04.426 --> 01:29:07.623
when you were making love to
Cristina or Maria Elena.

01:29:07.763 --> 01:29:09.321
Well, I never lied to you.

01:29:09.465 --> 01:29:11.524
I told you from the first moment

01:29:11.667 --> 01:29:13.726
that I was attracted to
both you and Cristina.

01:29:13.869 --> 01:29:20.433
I, I can't just go to bed with you.
I'm... I'm not good at this.

01:29:20.609 --> 01:29:23.476
- But you weren't nervous that night.
- I wasn't married.

01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:24.839
You were about to be.

01:29:25.014 --> 01:29:27.482
Yeah, you're right.
It's what I want.

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:29.650
But what am I supposed to do?

01:29:29.752 --> 01:29:31.617
Make love with you and then go

01:29:31.754 --> 01:29:33.984
on with my marriage
like nothing happened?

01:29:34.123 --> 01:29:35.818
Or, just terminate it?

01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:38.722
Judy Nash says you are heading
for an unhappy life.

01:29:38.861 --> 01:29:41.455
Yeah, well, she's talking
about herself.

01:29:42.531 --> 01:29:44.089
Maybe you will understand

01:29:44.233 --> 01:29:46.428
more about your own feelings
once we've made love.

01:29:46.568 --> 01:29:47.762
Yeah, or less.

01:29:47.903 --> 01:29:50.269
Look, I'm not saying
I'm not tempted...

01:29:50.406 --> 01:29:54.274
...but it would require
such an upheaval, emotionally...

01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:57.504
and from a practical point of view,
you're not exactly the kind of man

01:29:57.646 --> 01:29:59.546
to plan a future with.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.714
What are you doing?!

01:30:06.522 --> 01:30:07.648
You're goin' to kill yourself!

01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:09.421
I don't want to live.

01:30:09.558 --> 01:30:16.361
I don't want to live, damn it!

01:30:16.932 --> 01:30:17.830
Let it go. Now, now, now.

01:30:25.441 --> 01:30:29.207
Don't you understand that
I don't want to live,

01:30:29.345 --> 01:30:34.044
that I can't live like this.
My head is going to explode.

01:30:34.183 --> 01:30:35.480
I can't take this anymore.

01:30:35.617 --> 01:30:37.278
I can't take it anymore.

01:30:38.587 --> 01:30:39.849
Give me the gun.

01:30:39.988 --> 01:30:43.947
Give me the gun. Damn it!

01:30:44.093 --> 01:30:46.789
Listen to me, please, my love.

01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:48.526
My love, listen to me.

01:30:49.164 --> 01:30:50.756
Come. Give me your hand.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.302
Come. It's okay.
It's okay, my love. It's okay.

01:30:57.139 --> 01:30:57.764
Oh, my God.

01:30:57.906 --> 01:30:59.533
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

01:31:02.945 --> 01:31:04.537
Oh, my God, you're both crazy!

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.047
Both of you are completely insane!

01:31:08.183 --> 01:31:10.310
How the hell am I going to
explain this to my husband?!

01:31:10.452 --> 01:31:12.249
I can't live like this!

01:31:12.388 --> 01:31:14.151
This is not my life!

01:31:14.289 --> 01:31:16.757
I just can't do it!

01:31:20.696 --> 01:31:23.665
I still don't understand
why your language teacher had a gun.

01:31:23.799 --> 01:31:24.356
I told you.

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.525
He collects antique firearms.

01:31:26.668 --> 01:31:29.102
- He was showing me his favorite one
- God! We should sue him!

01:31:29.238 --> 01:31:31.138
- and it went off.
- That is so irresponsible!

01:31:31.273 --> 01:31:34.265
No, it's not that bad, honestly.

01:31:34.410 --> 01:31:35.809
What if something happened to you?

01:31:36.378 --> 01:31:38.471
What? What are you saying?

01:31:39.047 --> 01:31:40.378
I love you so much.

01:31:41.283 --> 01:31:43.478
Doug never found out the real story.

01:31:46.422 --> 01:31:48.515
Judy knew the secret and,
of course, was relieved

01:31:48.657 --> 01:31:51.148
that Vicky had not been hurt worse,
or killed.

01:31:52.494 --> 01:31:54.257
With Vicky leaving to
go back to New York,

01:31:54.496 --> 01:31:55.929
Judy's plans to rescue Vicky...

01:31:56.064 --> 01:31:58.658
...from her own fate were
put on terminal hold.

01:32:02.538 --> 01:32:05.871
When Cristina returned from Antibes,
Vicky told her the whole tale...

01:32:06.175 --> 01:32:07.403
and Cristina thought it was sad

01:32:07.543 --> 01:32:09.374
how much Vicky
had wanted Juan Antonio...

01:32:09.578 --> 01:32:11.910
...and was unable to say or
do anything about it.

01:32:12.214 --> 01:32:13.613
I would have stepped aside.

01:32:13.749 --> 01:32:15.580
Look, I knew you had feelings

01:32:15.717 --> 01:32:18.743
for Juan Antonio
the moment you saw him.

01:32:18.921 --> 01:32:21.219
But if I knew what had happened,
I never would have gone ahead with it.

01:32:21.356 --> 01:32:22.880
Look, it was a...

01:32:23.859 --> 01:32:25.656
...a passing thing.

01:32:27.329 --> 01:32:28.318
Now it's over.

01:32:56.725 --> 01:32:59.285
Vicky went home to have her
grand wedding to Doug...

01:32:59.928 --> 01:33:02.021
...to the house they both
finally settled on...

01:33:02.264 --> 01:33:03.959
...and to lead the life
she had envisioned

01:33:04.099 --> 01:33:06.829
for herself before the
summer in Barcelona.

01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:10.038
Cristina continued searching...

01:33:10.772 --> 01:33:13.502
...certain only of
what she didn't want.

01:35:40.037 --> 01:35:41.037
