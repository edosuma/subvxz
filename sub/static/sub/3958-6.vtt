00:03.419 --> 00:06.739
Let's have some fun.
Take your clothes off.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.846
Neither of us
are oil paintings, are we?

00:10.261 --> 00:11.216
Can I come in?

00:11.217 --> 00:13.857
No, Rae, you can't just come round
whenever you want.

00:13.924 --> 00:16.524
Come on, Chloe,
we've got to go. Go where?

00:16.591 --> 00:20.391
I'm not coming. Fine. Why aren't you
singing at the concert?

00:20.499 --> 00:22.418
I'm just standing in
until Chloe gets back.

00:22.419 --> 00:26.419
That is, if Chloe
bothers turning up.

00:33.299 --> 00:37.299
# It's been seven hours
and fifteen days

00:39.579 --> 00:43.058
# Since you took your love away

00:43.059 --> 00:46.338
# Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

00:46.339 --> 00:50.339
# I go out every night
and sleep all day

00:53.339 --> 00:56.778
# Since you took your love away

00:56.779 --> 01:00.538
# Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

01:00.539 --> 01:04.539
# Since you've been gone
I can do whatever I want

01:07.219 --> 01:10.178
# I can see whomever I choose

01:10.179 --> 01:13.818
# Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

01:13.819 --> 01:17.819
# I can eat my dinner
in a fancy restaurant

01:20.339 --> 01:24.339
# But nothing, I said nothing
can take away these blues

01:26.699 --> 01:30.699
# Cos nothing compares to you. #

01:35.579 --> 01:39.579
Whoo!

01:44.459 --> 01:46.378
Seriously, Rae, that was class.

01:46.379 --> 01:48.738
Why can't you do
the actual performance on Friday?

01:48.739 --> 01:52.418
I think I'd literally rather
stick a jellyfish in my kecks

01:52.419 --> 01:54.258
than sing in front of an audience.

01:54.259 --> 01:58.259
Anyway, I can't take Chloe's part.
Chloe's insisting on the lead vocal

01:58.659 --> 02:00.178
and she won't even turn up.

02:00.179 --> 02:04.018
She's a bitch. She's a total bitch.
Everybody says it, not just me.

02:04.019 --> 02:08.019
Leave her alone. Maybe she's got
stuff going on. Right, Rae?

02:08.818 --> 02:12.378
Dunno, Iz. Why isn't she here?

02:12.379 --> 02:14.818
OK, gang? Erm, I just got a call

02:14.819 --> 02:18.819
saying that Chloe isn't going to be
able to make it for the performance.

02:19.259 --> 02:23.259
You're going to have to find
a replacement for her.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.979
No.

03:31.699 --> 03:34.178
She's missing?

03:34.179 --> 03:35.258
W...

03:35.259 --> 03:38.618
Well, how long has she been gone?
Two days.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.898
She left a note.

03:41.899 --> 03:45.458
Please don't lose any sleep over it,
Rae. She does this all the time.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.258
I called the police the first time.

03:47.259 --> 03:49.658
She strolled in through
the front door a few hours later

03:49.659 --> 03:53.659
as if nothing had happened.
She's not responsible like you, Rae.

03:54.939 --> 03:57.498
OK, erm...

03:57.499 --> 04:01.499
Chloe's got some of the posters
that we need for the concert.

04:01.619 --> 04:05.619
Is it all right if I just...? Yeah,
course. You know where her room is.

04:10.779 --> 04:14.779
'Her dad was spot-on,
this was typical of Chloe.

04:16.099 --> 04:19.098

Hiya, sir. Hi, Chloe. All the girls
have been talking about you.

05:28.179 --> 05:31.298
They want to know what your name is.
Ah, it's Mr Carrisford.

05:31.299 --> 05:35.258
Yeah, well, we know that.
What's your first name?

05:35.259 --> 05:39.259
It's top secret.

05:39.379 --> 05:43.298
So, are we going to get a chance
to catch up now that school's over?

05:43.299 --> 05:47.299
What do you mean? Well, technically
I'm not a student here any more.

05:47.459 --> 05:49.498
So we could...

05:49.499 --> 05:51.298
meet up...

05:51.299 --> 05:55.299
have a chat.

06:02.459 --> 06:06.459
One piece of advice for the future.
Don't make promises you can't keep.

06:07.339 --> 06:11.339
I don't break promises.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.298
Chloe?

06:14.299 --> 06:16.418
It's Stephen.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.178
See you later, Ste.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.178
Found what you're looking for, love?

06:22.179 --> 06:25.098
I guess I'll just head off, then.

06:25.099 --> 06:27.538
'I don't know
what was more surprising,

06:27.539 --> 06:31.539
'the fact that Chloe kept a diary or
the fact that I was now stealing it.'

06:37.499 --> 06:41.499
Everyone, this is Chloe. Hiya.
She's the girl I met at dance. Hiya.

06:42.859 --> 06:46.859
'Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where do I come in?

06:47.379 --> 06:50.178
'Ah, here we go.'

06:50.179 --> 06:54.179
Everyone, this is Rae. OK, she's
amazing, she's funny, she's pretty.

06:55.619 --> 06:57.058
She can proper dance.

06:57.059 --> 07:00.618
And she could probably drink
all of you boys under the table.

07:00.619 --> 07:04.098
Bollocks. Ooh,
sounds like a challenge.

07:04.099 --> 07:06.338
Right, I'll get the shots in. OK.

07:06.339 --> 07:08.418
That's not what happened!

07:08.419 --> 07:12.419
That is total bollocks. She never
said all that stuff about me!

07:13.019 --> 07:17.019
She's warped it
to make herself feel good.

07:18.419 --> 07:22.419
Everyone, this is Rae. Y'all right?
Hiya! All right? Want a drink?

07:22.619 --> 07:26.058
Cos Chop can get served. Er, no,
it's all right. I don't drink.

07:26.059 --> 07:29.258
'See? I didn't even
bloody drink back then.

07:29.259 --> 07:33.259
'This is total, undiluted,
grade-A shit.'

07:37.219 --> 07:41.219
Oh, my God, guess who I seen today.
"Saw". Who? Rae Earl.

07:42.939 --> 07:46.738
She's back from France. Mm.

07:46.739 --> 07:50.739
What? Jacob Radcliffe's dad
says she's been ill.

07:51.259 --> 07:55.259
Mentally ill. It's no wonder, with
a mother like that, though, is it?

07:55.659 --> 07:57.378
So, what do you mean?

07:57.379 --> 08:00.538
She's not been in France?
I don't know where she's been.

08:00.539 --> 08:03.818
But I do know that she's had
a breakdown, though.

08:03.819 --> 08:07.138
I once heard her mother tell
Dr Entwistle to go and eff himself.

08:07.139 --> 08:09.138
You should stay away
from them both, Chloe.

08:09.139 --> 08:11.938
The whole family.
They're programmed differently.

08:11.939 --> 08:13.738
There you go.

08:13.739 --> 08:17.739
Is there nothing from the fry-up?
No, there isn't.

08:17.939 --> 08:19.378
Dad's got loads.

08:19.379 --> 08:21.618
Oh, men have bigger appetites
than women, Chloe,

08:21.619 --> 08:25.619
and big appetites need feeding.

08:44.459 --> 08:45.978
I didn't think you'd come.

08:45.979 --> 08:48.379
Thought you'd bottle it.
Yeah, well, I'm not a bottler.

09:02.539 --> 09:05.019
'Hi, this is Stephen.
Leave a message, I'll hit you back.'

09:07.819 --> 09:09.099
Come on, pick up!

09:10.539 --> 09:13.299
'Hi, this is Stephen.
Leave a message, I'll hit you back.'

09:17.699 --> 09:19.898
Pick up!

09:19.899 --> 09:22.018
'Hi, this is Stephen.
Leave a message, I'll hit you back.'

09:22.019 --> 09:23.738
Come on!

09:23.739 --> 09:27.098
Hiya. It's me. I...

09:27.099 --> 09:31.099
I know you told me not to call,
but can you ring me back, please?

09:31.419 --> 09:33.739
We just really need to talk.

10:08.179 --> 10:10.738
Are you feeling all right?

10:10.739 --> 10:14.739
A bit better.

10:16.539 --> 10:19.338
Listen, Chloe...

10:19.339 --> 10:22.778
..I wasn't in France this year.

10:22.779 --> 10:26.538
Where were you?

10:26.539 --> 10:29.938
I've been ill.

10:29.939 --> 10:32.978
I did something stupid.

10:32.979 --> 10:36.218
I hurt myself.

10:36.219 --> 10:40.219
Why would you do that?

10:40.499 --> 10:43.178
I will tell you.

10:43.179 --> 10:45.258
I just need time.

10:45.259 --> 10:47.858
Is that OK?

10:47.859 --> 10:50.738
Of course it is.

10:50.739 --> 10:54.739
I've got it!

10:55.819 --> 10:58.218
Hello?

10:58.219 --> 11:00.818
Yeah, well, then...

11:00.819 --> 11:03.898
What time?

11:03.899 --> 11:07.898
Right. Bye.

11:07.899 --> 11:11.218
Stephen.

11:11.219 --> 11:15.219
He wants me to go over.
But I'm not leaving you on your own.

11:16.819 --> 11:20.819
No. Hey, don't be silly.
You should go and talk to him.

11:24.699 --> 11:26.858
You sure? Yeah.

11:26.859 --> 11:30.058
I didn't say you could leave, Chloe.
You just bloody left.

11:30.059 --> 11:34.059
Ohhh! That's not how it happened.

11:36.379 --> 11:40.138
'That's not how it happened.
I don't...

11:40.139 --> 11:42.146
'Well, I don't remember it
like that.'

11:50.240 --> 11:54.200
OK, we've got to
pretend it's 7.30, yeah...?

11:54.902 --> 11:58.301
'Not only had she been lying
about what happened in her diary,

11:58.302 --> 12:02.302
'Chloe still hadn't
bloody shown up!'

12:29.174 --> 12:32.573
Rae.

12:32.574 --> 12:34.693
Rae, are you OK? No!

12:34.694 --> 12:38.693
No, I'm not. Mrs Coombes says that
if I don't do this performance,

12:38.694 --> 12:41.053
I'm not going to get a mark,
and I'm going to fail.

12:41.054 --> 12:43.693
I'm on a final warning as it is.

12:43.694 --> 12:45.293
I've got something that might help.

12:45.294 --> 12:48.613
Just take it to the show.

12:48.614 --> 12:51.293
We'll all bringing our parents.
I think you'll feel much better

12:51.294 --> 12:55.093
about it if you've got
someone there supporting you.

12:55.094 --> 12:58.413
Izzy.

12:58.414 --> 13:00.293
'Maybe Izzy was right.

13:00.294 --> 13:03.053
'If I had someone
there to support me,

13:03.054 --> 13:05.134
'maybe I could get through it.'

13:08.134 --> 13:12.134
'Hang on.'

13:16.334 --> 13:20.333
'What the fuck?!

13:20.334 --> 13:22.253
'Don't do it.

13:22.254 --> 13:26.254
'You don't need this
in your life right now.'

13:26.814 --> 13:29.053
..what do you call it then?

13:29.054 --> 13:32.093
And he went,
"Blackpool Eiffer." Eiffel...!

13:32.094 --> 13:35.694
I'm not talking about
that kind of tower, love!

13:38.894 --> 13:41.533
Simon! What is Simon like...?!

13:41.534 --> 13:43.493
'I really am crap at jokes.

13:43.494 --> 13:45.973
'Rae's always cracking jokes.

13:45.974 --> 13:48.773
'Some stuff I don't really get.
I'm not stupid -

13:48.774 --> 13:50.813
'I'm just not programmed like that.

13:50.814 --> 13:52.653
'I need to practise.'

13:52.654 --> 13:56.013
Yeah, but let's be honest, Rae, when
was the last time you seen a tower?

13:56.014 --> 14:00.014
Seriously?!

14:07.774 --> 14:09.493
You look down.

14:09.494 --> 14:11.413
Oh, I'm all right.

14:11.414 --> 14:13.653
You know what I do when I'm down?

14:13.654 --> 14:17.653
I pick up the beer mat of happiness.

14:17.654 --> 14:20.813
It used to be the beer mat of joy,
but there was...

14:20.814 --> 14:23.733
another beer mat somewhere else
called that, and then there was this

14:23.734 --> 14:27.053
bit, big court case about it, and it
got really complicated, and then...

14:27.054 --> 14:30.733
Anyway, just for today...

14:30.734 --> 14:33.133
..I'm going to give you
the beer mat of happiness.

14:33.134 --> 14:36.053
Yeah?

14:36.054 --> 14:37.373
I can't.

14:37.374 --> 14:41.374
It's too much for me to
handle, it's... too happy.

14:43.014 --> 14:44.653
Here you are.

14:44.654 --> 14:46.453
There you go.

14:46.454 --> 14:48.213
But I want that back, right?

14:48.214 --> 14:50.213
It's just a loan, yeah?

14:50.214 --> 14:54.214
OK. OK? OK!

15:00.574 --> 15:04.053
'I like Finn.
He's so different from Steven.

15:04.054 --> 15:06.973
'Finn makes me feel like you
do when you put on a new dress.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.733
'You know, when you get that
zing feeling... or whatever.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.533
'He makes me feel
like a good person.'

15:12.534 --> 15:14.654
Love from X.

15:30.694 --> 15:33.973
Go on!

15:33.974 --> 15:37.974
'Rae so clearly fancies Finn, too -
but I liked him first!

15:38.214 --> 15:40.693
'You know? I've liked
him since I've known him,

15:40.694 --> 15:42.173
'and I've known him longer.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.253
'Needed to mark the territory.

15:44.254 --> 15:47.173
'I needed to make it clear
Finn was mine to go for.'

15:47.174 --> 15:51.174
Oh, what does she think
Finn is, a fuckin' lamppost?

15:52.454 --> 15:54.533
Can I tell you something, Rae?

15:54.534 --> 15:57.933
It was me who sent
the letter to Finn.

15:57.934 --> 16:01.934
The more time I spend with him,
I realise how much I like him.

16:02.454 --> 16:05.693
I really like him.

16:05.694 --> 16:07.493
Do you like anyone at the minute?

16:07.494 --> 16:09.013
Not really.

16:09.014 --> 16:11.613
'I hate it when Rae lies to me.

16:11.614 --> 16:13.573
'We're supposed to be best friends.'

16:13.574 --> 16:15.413
Oh, piss off!

16:15.414 --> 16:17.253
'She can be so
self-centred sometimes.'

16:17.254 --> 16:18.893
Oh, piss right off!

16:18.894 --> 16:22.093
'Self-centred? Me?
Oh, let's look it up, shall we?

16:22.094 --> 16:26.094
'Ha! in your face, Chloe!'

16:31.814 --> 16:35.814
So, there's this singing event
thing at college on Friday.

16:36.134 --> 16:39.453
It's an assessed piece
for performing arts.

16:39.454 --> 16:43.454
I'm singing a solo, and...

16:49.414 --> 16:50.973
Well, I've...

16:50.974 --> 16:54.974
I've got some spare
tickets if you want to come.

16:57.254 --> 16:58.893
Mum.

16:58.894 --> 17:01.453
What?

17:01.454 --> 17:05.333
Well, do you want to come...
to the concert?

17:05.334 --> 17:09.334
No.

17:13.334 --> 17:16.252
I'm sorry I missed the scan.

17:16.253 --> 17:18.133
I went on my own.

17:18.134 --> 17:21.173
I sat in that hospital on my own,

17:21.174 --> 17:23.133
feeling rotten,

17:23.134 --> 17:25.853
not sure what was going
on inside me, and you couldn't even

17:25.854 --> 17:29.093
be bothered to show your face,
and you're asking me for support!

17:29.094 --> 17:31.533
Mum, I've got to sing in front
of the whole college...!

17:31.534 --> 17:34.573
You're not listening, are you?
Just thinking about yourself,

17:34.574 --> 17:36.693
just like you always do.

17:36.694 --> 17:39.173
You're only sorry
because you feel guilty,

17:39.174 --> 17:42.053
cos you're being self-centred.

17:42.054 --> 17:45.093
I'm not self-centred. I never
said you WERE self-centred,

17:45.094 --> 17:47.133
I said you were BEING self-centred.

17:47.134 --> 17:51.134
I'M NOT SELF-CENTRED!

17:54.654 --> 17:57.373
I'm sorry if you're angry
about the other night.

17:57.374 --> 18:00.533
But I just wanted to explain that I
also have stuff going on, you know,

18:00.534 --> 18:02.893
I had a visitor. That woman?

18:02.894 --> 18:06.533
Yes, that woman.

18:06.534 --> 18:09.133
Let's just say I don't...
I don't want to mess things up.

18:09.134 --> 18:13.093
You know that feeling.

18:13.094 --> 18:17.094
I just wanted... to tell
you it from my point of view.

18:17.494 --> 18:18.893
You know.

18:18.894 --> 18:21.133
Because I only ever think of myself?

18:21.134 --> 18:23.733
Because I'm self-centred, right?

18:23.734 --> 18:25.733
That's not what I'm saying.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.373
I needed you.

18:27.374 --> 18:30.493
You gave me your number and
you said to ring when I wanted.

18:30.494 --> 18:33.373
I didn't say that,
I said you could ring if...

18:33.374 --> 18:35.333
y-you were feeling...

18:35.334 --> 18:38.013
you were going to do something
stupid, or if you felt like you

18:38.014 --> 18:40.933
were going to hurt yourself again?
How do you know that I wasn't?

18:40.934 --> 18:44.933
Were you?

18:44.934 --> 18:46.293
Well...

18:46.294 --> 18:50.294
you're the expert at seeing things
from other people's points of view.

18:52.734 --> 18:56.533
I want to, er...

18:56.534 --> 19:00.053
I want to set up good
boundaries between us.

19:00.054 --> 19:03.173
Because I care about you,
and I need to...

19:03.174 --> 19:07.174
be sure that I'm doing the
best job possible for you.

19:07.294 --> 19:09.573
Sometimes that means

19:09.574 --> 19:13.574
putting a bit of space between us.

19:17.334 --> 19:21.334
Me and Liam fooled
around the other night.

19:22.814 --> 19:24.813
When... when did...
when did that happen?

19:24.814 --> 19:28.814
Couple of nights ago. Mm-hmm.

19:30.254 --> 19:33.853
What was that like? It was horrible.

19:33.854 --> 19:36.213
He told me to keep my
top on, because he said

19:36.214 --> 19:38.973
we're not exactly oil paintings.

19:38.974 --> 19:42.173
And how did that make you feel?
Good.

19:42.174 --> 19:45.253
Because it confirmed everything that
I feel about myself.

19:45.254 --> 19:49.254
I told you, I specifically... said that
you were to be careful around Liam.

19:50.054 --> 19:53.293
I mean, it's not good for you
and he... it's not good

19:53.294 --> 19:57.294
that any two people involved in
therapy to get involved.

19:57.334 --> 20:01.334
Yeah, well... maybe not everyone's
as good as boundaries as you are.

20:10.254 --> 20:13.653
'It was the first time I'd ever been
nervous about anything.

20:13.654 --> 20:15.613
'Now, if I could kiss him,

20:15.614 --> 20:19.614
'if I could make him see how much I
loved him, how much I wanted him...

20:20.494 --> 20:23.574
'Do it. Just go and do it.'

20:39.934 --> 20:41.933
You are an amazing kisser.

20:41.934 --> 20:43.253
Did you like that did you?

20:43.254 --> 20:45.893
Best, ever.

20:45.894 --> 20:46.853
Ever!

20:46.854 --> 20:48.493
'Oh, my God!

20:48.494 --> 20:52.494
'Finn was banging to me.
Best night EVER.'

21:05.694 --> 21:09.493
OK, so... so I'm gonna go.

21:09.494 --> 21:12.573
OK.

21:12.574 --> 21:16.574
'It's awkward now, but it won't be
after a few days of going out.

21:17.014 --> 21:20.973
'Maybe I should just hold his hand,
make things seem less weird.'

21:20.974 --> 21:23.493
Look, Collett.

21:23.494 --> 21:25.893
I'm sorry about last night.

21:25.894 --> 21:28.293
What do you mean?

21:28.294 --> 21:29.773
I was drunk.

21:29.774 --> 21:31.853
So what, everyone was drunk.

21:31.854 --> 21:34.693
Yeah, I know, but...

21:34.694 --> 21:37.173
You should never really kiss...

21:37.174 --> 21:41.174
someone unless you really mean
it, right?

21:41.534 --> 21:45.534
Especially not your friends.

21:45.774 --> 21:48.413
I'm sorry. I fucked up.

21:48.414 --> 21:50.093
No, it's all right, it was...

21:50.094 --> 21:52.453
It was only a kiss.

21:52.454 --> 21:55.293
It didn't mean anything.

21:55.294 --> 21:56.573
Suppose.

21:56.574 --> 21:59.413
It's not like we did it.

21:59.414 --> 22:02.493
I felt bad. Don't!

22:02.494 --> 22:04.853
Don't.

22:04.854 --> 22:05.574
Well...

22:06.614 --> 22:08.853
I'm gonna go and get a shower.

22:08.854 --> 22:12.573
And I'm going to get myself a shift
load of peppermint tea.

22:12.574 --> 22:16.574
I'll See you later, yeah?
Yeah, see you later.

22:42.774 --> 22:45.013
'This is what you're angry about?'

22:45.014 --> 22:49.014
Wouldn't you be angry if your best
mate said you didn't deserve someone?

22:50.934 --> 22:52.813
Oi! What are you laughing at?

22:52.814 --> 22:54.413
Chloe...

22:54.414 --> 22:57.133
What? I didn't mean it.

22:57.134 --> 22:59.573
You're welcome to him, I guess.

22:59.574 --> 23:02.053
Am I a bitch, Rae?
Everyone can be a bitch.

23:02.054 --> 23:05.013
Yeah, but it's like some more than
others, isn't it?

23:05.014 --> 23:09.013
Chloe...?

23:09.014 --> 23:10.493
You're not a bitch.

23:10.494 --> 23:14.494
All right then, I'm not.

23:19.374 --> 23:21.533
'Maybe Rae didn't mean it?

23:21.534 --> 23:23.333
'But what if she was right?

23:23.334 --> 23:26.933
'What if I didn't deserve
someone like Finn?

23:26.934 --> 23:29.613
'What if I didn't deserve
someone good.

23:29.614 --> 23:33.614
'Rae's a beautiful person,
not bitchy and broken like me.'

23:35.734 --> 23:36.997
You're not a bitch.

23:59.480 --> 24:03.734
Anxiety often feels like something
that's overwhelming cos it's big

24:04.414 --> 24:07.773
and grey, like a dark cloud.

24:07.774 --> 24:11.573
So, it's really important when you're
feeling that way that you try

24:11.574 --> 24:15.574
and narrow down exactly what it is
that you're worried about.

24:17.094 --> 24:19.813
And that way...

24:19.814 --> 24:23.814
Sorry.

24:24.374 --> 24:28.374
So, em...

24:29.294 --> 24:32.173
So, has anyone...?

24:32.174 --> 24:36.174
Anyone got anything that they're
worried about at the moment?

24:36.774 --> 24:39.693
I'm going home next week.

24:39.694 --> 24:41.013
Thanks.

24:41.014 --> 24:43.333
Thanks a lot.

24:43.334 --> 24:47.334
And I'm worried about being
too excited.

24:47.934 --> 24:51.934
And having too much fun.

24:52.414 --> 24:56.414
Great, great. Em, anyone else?

24:58.894 --> 25:02.894
I've got a concert at college.

25:02.934 --> 25:06.373
I don't know if I can do it or not.

25:06.374 --> 25:10.374
OK, great.
Has anyone got any advice for Rae?

25:12.134 --> 25:14.134
You could imagine
the audience naked.

25:15.534 --> 25:17.413
All right, Liam,
that's great, thank you.

25:17.414 --> 25:20.733
Like imagine all their bits
flapping around.

25:20.734 --> 25:23.133
You know, flesh...
Look, Liam, anyone else?

25:23.134 --> 25:25.493
Anybody? ..people say it helps
but on second thoughts,

25:25.494 --> 25:28.293
do you really want to imagine all
the teachers with their kits off?

25:28.294 --> 25:30.733
All right, Liam, we've got
that, I think. And I mean...

25:30.734 --> 25:33.453
Liam! ..because your anxiety may
disappear cos you might end up

25:33.454 --> 25:34.613
being sick everywhere.

25:34.614 --> 25:38.614
Will you shut your mouth, please?!

25:41.854 --> 25:45.293
Do you have to be so disruptive?!
Do you?!

25:45.294 --> 25:49.294
People come here to try to learn to
cope and all you do is undermine it!

26:05.774 --> 26:08.133
Stop. Fuck him and fuck this place!

26:08.134 --> 26:10.893
Nobody talks to me like that,
it's bullshit!

26:10.894 --> 26:13.373
I'm not coming here any more,
I'm done with therapy.

26:13.374 --> 26:15.293
Liam, you don't mean that.

26:15.294 --> 26:18.133
Yeah, I do. It doesn't work.

26:18.134 --> 26:22.134
Behaviour is habitual, it's like a
path you walk over and over again.

26:23.454 --> 26:27.454
A divot, a furrow, you follow that
path and you don't think about it.

26:27.574 --> 26:30.093
Yep, I know what habitual means,
Liam.

26:30.094 --> 26:33.413
In therapy, we learn why our paths
in our heads are formed

26:33.414 --> 26:36.653
the way they are,
why we're "fucked up"

26:36.654 --> 26:39.333
and whenever we go
out into the real world,

26:39.334 --> 26:42.253
it's a problem because we
still walk down the same path

26:42.254 --> 26:46.254
and we still make the same choices
because people can't change.

26:49.454 --> 26:50.853
People can change.

26:50.854 --> 26:53.093
Yeah?

26:53.094 --> 26:56.813
That's what Kester
wants you to think.

26:56.814 --> 27:00.814
Because me and you, Rae, we are
always going to be fuck-ups.

27:03.854 --> 27:05.533
We are.

27:05.534 --> 27:09.093
But there's nothing wrong with that.

27:09.094 --> 27:12.933
And maybe...

27:12.934 --> 27:16.934
..maybe we could be
fuck-ups together.

27:17.334 --> 27:21.334
What do you mean? I know that I said
I didn't want to go out with you.

27:22.294 --> 27:23.893
The more time I spend with you,

27:23.894 --> 27:27.894
the more I realise that we were
made for each other.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.053
Just think about it.

27:30.054 --> 27:34.054
Yeah?

27:52.254 --> 27:56.254
'Imagine them naked. Naked, naked.'

27:59.534 --> 28:03.534
'Nearly. Come on,
imagine them naked.

28:03.974 --> 28:07.974
'Imagine their bits just flapping
around. Imagine the humanity of it.'

28:31.374 --> 28:35.374
Wake up, Rae.

28:40.214 --> 28:41.813
'Just leave it.

28:41.814 --> 28:44.933
'It's going to mess you up
and it's going to make you anxious

28:44.934 --> 28:48.934
'and you don't need that
in your life at the moment.'

28:50.854 --> 28:54.854
'Dear Diary, it's a good thing that
Finn and Rae are so happy together.

28:56.174 --> 29:00.174
'I should be happy for them, right?
That means I have to move on.'

29:02.774 --> 29:06.093
World War II didn't even start
when Hitler invaded Poland.

29:06.094 --> 29:10.093
It started when Japan invaded China.
Isn't that crazy?

29:10.094 --> 29:14.094
Yeah, I don't know.
I was crap at history, really.

29:14.774 --> 29:18.774
I'm crap at anything like that.
You're not crap at anything.

29:19.414 --> 29:22.133
Garvey said,
"If you have no confidence in self,

29:22.134 --> 29:25.933
"you're twice defeated in life."
Good old Garvey.

29:25.934 --> 29:29.934
Yeah.

29:36.454 --> 29:39.413
I, eh...

29:39.414 --> 29:43.414
Good night, Chlo.

30:12.494 --> 30:14.493
Izzy, I don't believe it.

30:14.494 --> 30:17.453
That's the second girl
I've seen wearing this outfit.

30:17.454 --> 30:20.533
Yeah, well, maybe hers is more
of like a pinky-blue whereas yours

30:20.534 --> 30:22.613
is more like... purple-y.

30:22.614 --> 30:24.813
Izzy, it's the exact same colour.

30:24.814 --> 30:28.814
Right, my first day at college is
ruined. It couldn't get any worse.

30:36.254 --> 30:38.973
'I had to find a way to stand out.

30:38.974 --> 30:42.973
'Boys won't realise how cool you are
if they don't know you exist.

30:42.974 --> 30:46.974
'But how do you get them
to notice you?'

30:50.654 --> 30:51.933
Are you sure?

30:51.934 --> 30:55.934
Yeah, I've not got
much of an appetite.

31:24.574 --> 31:28.574
Here you go. Cheers. It's all right.
Thanks for coming, Rae, I just...

31:29.694 --> 31:33.694
Well, I just wanted to talk to you
about something. God, my life sucks.

31:35.254 --> 31:37.773
I don't even know why
I call it a life.

31:37.774 --> 31:41.573
Calling it a life is like a breach
of the Trade Descriptions Act.

31:41.574 --> 31:44.653
Well, I'm thinking of doing
something a bit, em... well,

31:44.654 --> 31:48.654
a bit crazy. And I wanted to
talk to you about it... So what?

31:48.894 --> 31:52.894
I missed a few days of college.
That's not a big deal, is it?

31:53.654 --> 31:57.654
The way my mum reacted, you'd think
I'd been caught selling crack.

31:58.054 --> 32:01.973
God, she is a pain in the arse.

32:01.974 --> 32:05.974
Oh! I'm sorry, Chloe.
Sorry, what were you saying?

32:06.974 --> 32:10.974
Nothing. Nothing.

32:13.014 --> 32:17.014
'How many moments did
I miss like that?'

32:17.134 --> 32:21.134
'How many times had I let Chloe down
when she needed some support?

32:21.734 --> 32:25.734
'Needed a friend?'

32:29.014 --> 32:31.773
Oh, my God, Rae. Hiya.

32:31.774 --> 32:34.973
What are you doing here?

32:34.974 --> 32:37.893
Are you going somewhere?
Yeah, we're off to Portugal.

32:37.894 --> 32:40.333
We saw a deal last night on teletext
and we thought,

32:40.334 --> 32:42.333
"Bollocks to it, let's go!"

32:42.334 --> 32:45.253
We? Eh, yeah, I'm sorry,
I never introduced you.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.893
This is Jude, my partner. Hello.

32:47.894 --> 32:51.253
Em, well, what about tea
tomorrow night?

32:51.254 --> 32:53.853
I thought I was supposed
to come round on Saturdays.

32:53.854 --> 32:55.493
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

32:55.494 --> 32:59.494
What's going on? Oh, don't worry,
darling, you get in the cab.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.693
Why don't we meet up when I get back?

33:02.694 --> 33:05.133
Huh? Can't wait.

33:05.134 --> 33:09.134
I mean it. OK?

33:18.054 --> 33:21.813
'Maybe I didn't deserve
anyone's support.

33:21.814 --> 33:25.814
'Maybe being a letdown
ran in the family.'

33:47.694 --> 33:51.414
'And it wasn't just that
I hadn't been there for her.'

33:54.454 --> 33:57.213
I'm just worried about her.

33:57.214 --> 34:01.013
I know.
Why didn't she set the alarm off?

34:01.014 --> 34:04.813
I'm scared if she gets sick again,
Archie, we can't let that happen.

34:04.814 --> 34:08.813
I won't let that happen.

34:09.174 --> 34:13.174
'It was that she had been
there for me.'

34:15.813 --> 34:19.813
'Whenever I'd been at my lowest ebb,
she'd been there for me.'

34:31.134 --> 34:35.134
'And it wasn't just reading a diary
that made me realise it. I knew it.

34:36.614 --> 34:40.614
'Because now, when I really
needed her, she was gone.'

34:46.174 --> 34:49.533
'Dear Diary, how long does Finn
have to be single before I can

34:49.534 --> 34:51.933
'ask him out?' Finn.

34:51.934 --> 34:55.053
All right. Hi. You OK? Yeah.

34:55.054 --> 34:58.733
Look, I've got to run but I'll see
you later at the pub maybe, yeah?

34:58.734 --> 35:01.133
Yeah. See you in a bit. Bye.

35:01.134 --> 35:04.253
'Maybe I should accept that
guys like Finn don't go out with

35:04.254 --> 35:06.013
'girls like me.

35:06.014 --> 35:09.253
'They want someone interesting,
someone funny and clever.

35:09.254 --> 35:11.173
'I'm not good at any of that.'

35:11.174 --> 35:14.293
Got a light?

35:14.294 --> 35:16.973
I don't smoke.

35:16.974 --> 35:20.253
Want a beer?
What makes you think I drink?

35:20.254 --> 35:24.254
You don't smoke, you don't drink.
What do you do?

35:29.054 --> 35:31.136
'I am good at some things, though.'

35:37.114 --> 35:41.114
I don't want to kiss you. Yeah,
but my kiss is not on the mouth. You wish!

35:50.769 --> 35:53.688
Oi, just a kiss! I know.

35:53.689 --> 35:57.609
All right, let's do this!

36:04.281 --> 36:07.680
The concert was in a few hours
and I had to rehearse,

36:07.681 --> 36:11.681
I had to concentrate!

36:15.361 --> 36:18.880
There were only a few pages left
to bring us to the present day.

36:18.881 --> 36:21.920
It was like moving slowly
past a crumpled heap

36:21.921 --> 36:25.040
on the motorway... I
couldn't look away.

36:25.041 --> 36:28.600
I know you're not the type of
girl who likes to stop at a kiss.

36:28.601 --> 36:30.080
Maybe not,

36:30.081 --> 36:32.520
I had you down as the type of
man who's a bit of a bottler.

36:32.521 --> 36:33.920
What do you mean?

36:33.921 --> 36:37.921
All mouth, no trousers.

36:39.361 --> 36:43.361
I'm not a fucking bottler!
Well, prove it.

36:48.201 --> 36:52.201
How much could I have helped her
if only I'd been a better friend?

36:52.321 --> 36:53.920
How much would be different?

36:53.921 --> 36:55.360
Come on, Chloe, we're going.

36:55.361 --> 36:57.960
Going where? I'm not going anywhere.

36:57.961 --> 37:00.840
Saul just tried it on with me
in the toilet... it was horrible!

37:00.841 --> 37:02.720
I could barely get away,
we're going home.

37:02.721 --> 37:06.320
Well, I'm fine, Rae, if you
want to go, that's fine.

37:06.321 --> 37:10.321
Whatever, Chlo.

37:13.081 --> 37:16.800
Your friend shouldn't look
a gift horse in the mouth!

37:16.801 --> 37:18.640
What do you mean?

37:18.641 --> 37:21.080
Doubt she's got loads of
people wanting to fuck her,

37:21.081 --> 37:24.400
she should take
whatever comes along.

37:24.401 --> 37:28.401
Get me a slice of pizza.

37:50.881 --> 37:54.280
Rae isn't around much at the
moment because she's got Liam.

37:54.281 --> 37:57.200
So, there's no-one I
can really talk to.

37:57.201 --> 38:00.880
Well, there is one
person I can go to.

38:00.881 --> 38:03.200
One person who makes me feel safe

38:03.201 --> 38:04.760
and makes me feel good.

38:04.761 --> 38:07.600
Oi, what's up, stud?

38:07.601 --> 38:09.200
Not much.

38:09.201 --> 38:13.040
I broke up with Olivia.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.360
Well, are you all right?

38:15.361 --> 38:17.160
Yeah.

38:17.161 --> 38:21.161
Oh, my God! He's single again.

38:23.921 --> 38:25.960
You have to tell him how you feel.

38:25.961 --> 38:29.961
Look what happened last
time... tell him... tell him.

38:30.601 --> 38:32.920
Oh, God!

38:32.921 --> 38:36.921
Chloe, can I ask you something? Yeah.

38:38.721 --> 38:41.680
How do you get over someone?

38:41.681 --> 38:45.681
How do you move on?
Well, what do you mean?

38:47.121 --> 38:51.121
I broke up with her because...

38:51.641 --> 38:55.641
..I can't stop thinking about Rae.

38:57.161 --> 38:59.800
Erm...

38:59.801 --> 39:03.801
I don't know how you
get over someone.

39:04.961 --> 39:08.040
I'm crap at advice.

39:08.041 --> 39:12.041
I'm crap at anything
like that, really.

39:12.681 --> 39:16.681
Maybe you never do.

39:21.841 --> 39:25.841
Come on, let's go to the fucking pub!

39:27.561 --> 39:31.561
Take me chips with me.

39:38.921 --> 39:42.921
Oh, shit!

39:44.201 --> 39:47.880
Ian, have you seen my purse?

39:47.881 --> 39:49.480
Ian, have you seen my purse?

39:49.481 --> 39:52.280
No. Well, I need it because I'm
going now. Shut the fuck up, Chloe.

39:52.281 --> 39:53.720
Ian, don't talk to me like that!

39:53.721 --> 39:56.280
Have you saw it? I
said, shut the fuck up!

39:56.281 --> 39:59.680
And it's seen, stupid slag.

39:59.681 --> 40:03.080
Come on! I'm paused here,
who the fuck paused it?

40:03.081 --> 40:04.320
Do you know what, Ian?

40:04.321 --> 40:06.960
Go and find someone else to be
horrible to because I'm leaving.

40:06.961 --> 40:09.480
You'll be back. No, I won't!

40:09.481 --> 40:12.160
Right, you don't deserve me

40:12.161 --> 40:15.920
and I deserve better.

40:15.921 --> 40:18.880
You will be back because if
I have to come and find you,

40:18.881 --> 40:22.881
I'll be very annoyed.

40:24.561 --> 40:25.880
# She's a rich girl

40:25.881 --> 40:27.240
# Ooh-ah, ooh-ah

40:27.241 --> 40:28.680
# Don't try to hide it

40:28.681 --> 40:29.840
# Ooh-ah, ooh-ah

40:29.841 --> 40:31.840
# Diamonds on the
soles of her shoes... #

40:31.841 --> 40:33.200
Great!

40:33.201 --> 40:34.440
# He's a poor boy

40:34.441 --> 40:35.600
# Ooh-ah, ooh-ah

40:35.601 --> 40:38.560
# Empty as a pocket,
empty as a pocket

40:38.561 --> 40:41.120
# With nothing to
lose, sing to-na-na

40:41.121 --> 40:42.280
# To-na-na

40:42.281 --> 40:43.840
# To-na-na-na-na

40:43.841 --> 40:47.800
# She's diamonds on
the soles of her shoes

40:47.801 --> 40:49.000
# To-na-na

40:49.001 --> 40:50.040
# To-na-na

40:50.041 --> 40:51.440
# To-na-na-na-na

40:51.441 --> 40:55.080
# She's got diamonds on
the soles of her shoes. #

40:55.081 --> 40:56.880
Well done! Are you happy?

40:56.881 --> 40:58.640
Yeah. Yeah. Greg?

40:58.641 --> 41:00.520
Happy. Izz? Yeah.

41:00.521 --> 41:03.720
Do you like the arrangement? I think
I've got it? Yeah, what is it then?

41:03.721 --> 41:05.800
To-na-na, to-na-na-na-na...

41:05.801 --> 41:07.080
Sorry I'm late.

41:07.081 --> 41:08.880
Where have you been?

41:08.881 --> 41:12.881
Oh... just... just had a bug.

41:16.041 --> 41:19.760
What's up? Nothing.
What's the matter with you?

41:19.761 --> 41:22.120
What's the matter with me?

41:22.121 --> 41:23.840
You let me down at the party.

41:23.841 --> 41:25.040
Look, Rae...

41:25.041 --> 41:29.041
You just left me stranded! I was
in trouble and you did nothing!

41:29.201 --> 41:32.120
Rae, I'm really sorry, I
didn't realise, I was drunk.

41:32.121 --> 41:35.120
Can we please meet up and talk
later cos there's something I'm...

41:35.121 --> 41:38.200
You're supposed to be my best mate,
Chloe, and you don't give a shit!

41:38.201 --> 41:40.360
Will you just listen to
what I'm trying to say!

41:40.361 --> 41:42.640
I'm not your mum!

41:42.641 --> 41:46.641
I can't look after you all the time.

41:48.401 --> 41:50.360
Stay away from me.

41:50.361 --> 41:53.000
Rae, please!

41:53.001 --> 41:55.400
No, no...

41:55.401 --> 41:58.000
No, no, no.

41:58.001 --> 42:00.560
..no, no, no!

42:00.561 --> 42:02.880
The concert was in an hour

42:02.881 --> 42:06.881
but my heart was too broken
to feel afraid any more.

42:07.601 --> 42:09.320
I was too far gone.

42:09.321 --> 42:13.321
No cuts or burns or pinches on
my body had ever gone this deep.

42:17.961 --> 42:21.961
Because of me, because of my
actions, my selfishness,

42:23.161 --> 42:25.361
Chloe was gone!

42:36.001 --> 42:37.680
Everyone, this is Rae.

42:37.681 --> 42:39.560
She's amazing, she's funny.

42:39.561 --> 42:41.560
So, are we going to get
a chance to catch up?

42:41.561 --> 42:43.120
Have you not been in France?

42:43.121 --> 42:44.640
I don't know where she's been.

42:44.641 --> 42:45.840
I don't break promises.

42:45.841 --> 42:47.560
I do know she's had
a breakdown though.

42:47.561 --> 42:48.640
I did something stupid.

42:48.641 --> 42:51.160
Stay away from
them both, the whole family,

42:51.161 --> 42:52.680
they're programmed differently.

42:52.681 --> 42:54.000
I'm not leaving you on our own.

42:54.001 --> 42:57.040
Rae so clearly fancies Finn
too but I liked him first!

42:57.041 --> 42:58.880
We just really need to talk, Rae.

42:58.881 --> 43:00.600
It was only a kiss.

43:00.601 --> 43:02.360
What if I didn't
deserve someone good.

43:02.361 --> 43:04.040
Rae's a beautiful person.

43:04.041 --> 43:05.520
I'm not a fucking bottler.

43:05.521 --> 43:07.080
I'm not bitching, I'm broken.

43:07.081 --> 43:10.000
I'm scared if she gets
sick again, I can't let that happen.

43:10.001 --> 43:13.000
You're supposed to be my best mate,
Chloe, and you don't give a shit!

43:13.001 --> 43:15.280
You don't care about
anyone but yourself!

43:15.281 --> 43:19.281
I'm not your mum!

43:28.561 --> 43:32.561
# It's been seven hours and 15 days

43:34.841 --> 43:38.680
# Since you took your love away

43:38.681 --> 43:42.681
# Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

43:43.321 --> 43:47.321
# I go out every night
and sleep all day

43:50.841 --> 43:54.720
# Since you took your love away

43:54.721 --> 43:58.721
# Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

44:01.361 --> 44:05.361
# I went to the doctor and
guess what he told me? #

44:13.001 --> 44:17.001
# I could put my arms
around every boy I see... #

44:55.321 --> 44:59.321
Nine months in therapy. Nine months,
going back to the same point.

44:59.921 --> 45:03.921
Nine months of, "You need to
like yourself more, Rae."

45:04.721 --> 45:08.040
Well, the truth is, now I've
seen things the way they are.

45:08.041 --> 45:11.960
I've never liked myself any
less than I do right now.

45:11.961 --> 45:13.480
Because, guess what?

45:13.481 --> 45:16.360
I am a bitch!

45:16.361 --> 45:20.080
There was only one
last page to read.

45:20.081 --> 45:23.560
But I already knew exactly
how this story ended.

45:23.561 --> 45:25.960
I left a message
for Chloe's parents,

45:25.961 --> 45:28.480
telling them where I
thought she might have gone,

45:28.481 --> 45:32.241
where I knew she was.

45:37.601 --> 45:41.601
Dear diary, I'm crap at most things

45:41.841 --> 45:45.841
but one thing I'm not crap at... men.

45:47.121 --> 45:51.121
I understand their appetites.

45:51.841 --> 45:53.961
I know what they need feeding.

46:09.721 --> 46:13.560
Like Liam says, you can't
change your behaviour.

46:13.561 --> 46:16.880
We walk the same old
paths, the same old divots,

46:16.881 --> 46:20.600
the same old furrows and my
paths are concreted over,

46:20.601 --> 46:24.601
my furrows are as deep as Grand
Canyon's and a girl like me,

46:25.521 --> 46:29.160
well, she's got to take
whatever she can get!

46:29.161 --> 46:33.161
What can I say... I'm surprised and
delighted to see you this evening.

46:35.561 --> 46:38.401
I just think...

46:54.721 --> 46:57.680
You sure you want to do this?

46:57.681 --> 47:01.681
Don't talk.

47:04.481 --> 47:07.160
What are you doing?

47:07.161 --> 47:09.760
I'm turning the light off.

47:09.761 --> 47:13.761
We're not exactly
oil paintings, are we?
