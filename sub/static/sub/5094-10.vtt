WEBVTT

00:06.335 --> 00:07.307
You've got no choice.

00:07.332 --> 00:10.168
Of course, I do,
and I not to attend.

00:10.857 --> 00:11.601
Morning Baker.

00:11.626 --> 00:13.912
All due respect, you're being
incredibly unreasonable.

00:13.937 --> 00:15.492
Part of my gruff charm.

00:15.517 --> 00:16.898
The Citizens Defense League

00:16.923 --> 00:18.818
is a legitimate
civil-rights organization.

00:18.843 --> 00:22.120
In the eyes of the IRS,
for tax purposes maybe.

00:22.145 --> 00:25.095
Anyone else with half a brain,
sees them for what they are.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.723
A left-wing
political action cabal.

00:27.748 --> 00:30.068
They just want you to attend
their awards dinner next week.

00:30.409 --> 00:31.856
Dreams die hard.

00:31.881 --> 00:34.079
Forward the invitation
to the Inspector General.

00:34.104 --> 00:35.836
She's got a prior
engagement in D.C.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.856
Lucky her.
Still a pass.

00:37.881 --> 00:40.252
We've got the Police Academy
curriculum meeting at 10.

00:40.277 --> 00:40.844
Ok.

00:40.869 --> 00:43.848
Won't look right. A representative
from the NYPD should be there.

00:43.873 --> 00:45.912
You look smart in a tux.
Have a great evening.

00:45.937 --> 00:47.752
Look, I know
you don't like people...

00:47.777 --> 00:49.597
I don't like these people?

00:49.622 --> 00:52.808
The CDL is a bunch
of radical fringe bottom feeders,

00:52.833 --> 00:56.047
who raise money
by vilifying the NYPD.

00:58.086 --> 01:00.239
Final answer.
No!

01:04.617 --> 01:06.584
(sighs)

01:06.586 --> 01:08.770
(garbled radio transmission)

01:10.706 --> 01:12.374
(siren wailing in distance)

01:12.376 --> 01:14.209
Double check
that air vent.

01:14.211 --> 01:15.510
Right there.

01:15.512 --> 01:16.878
(dog barking)

01:16.880 --> 01:19.130
DANNY:
Ah, what a mess.

01:19.132 --> 01:21.182
Who'd be crazy enough
to bomb a mosque?

01:21.184 --> 01:22.634
Hey, Rick.

01:22.636 --> 01:23.852
How's it going?

01:23.854 --> 01:25.003
Could be worse. You?

01:25.005 --> 01:26.170
Ah, you know.

01:26.172 --> 01:28.940
Same old same old.
Maria Baez, Rick Kelly.

01:28.942 --> 01:30.725
Best marshal
the FDNY has,

01:30.727 --> 01:32.527
not to mention the best
third baseman

01:32.529 --> 01:34.279
the softball team's ever had.

01:34.281 --> 01:35.780
Yeah, not anymore. Bum knee.

01:35.782 --> 01:37.198
What have we got here?
Looks like

01:37.200 --> 01:38.650
a pipe bomb tossed
through a window.

01:38.652 --> 01:40.819
Pipe bomb. Anybody hurt?

01:40.821 --> 01:42.287
We got lucky.

01:42.289 --> 01:44.656
Smoke inhalation,
minor burns, but no casualties.

01:44.658 --> 01:46.741
How bad's the damage?

01:46.743 --> 01:48.410
The collateral fire
we put out pretty quick.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.161
We're still assessing
the structure.

01:50.163 --> 01:51.579
Hate crime task force
takes it from there.

01:51.581 --> 01:52.998
Thanks.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.749
You got it.
Good to meet you, Baez.

01:54.751 --> 01:56.968
You, too.

01:57.753 --> 01:59.087
He's married.

01:59.089 --> 02:00.255
Just browsing.

02:00.257 --> 02:01.423
Ah. Just telling you.

02:01.425 --> 02:02.640
MAN:
Detectives,

02:02.642 --> 02:04.876
this is Imam Ansar.

02:04.878 --> 02:06.895
Imam, were you here
when the bomb went off?

02:06.897 --> 02:09.547
I was leading prayers
when I heard the window break.

02:09.549 --> 02:11.433
Then there was
an explosion and fire.

02:11.435 --> 02:14.019
You have any idea who would
want to do this to a mosque?

02:14.021 --> 02:15.720
I thought that was your job.

02:15.722 --> 02:19.107
Well, it is our job, but you
live here and we don't.

02:19.109 --> 02:21.860
There are people who don't
want us in the neighborhood.

02:21.862 --> 02:24.079
So, you've had trouble before?

02:24.081 --> 02:25.229
Several break-ins.

02:25.231 --> 02:27.332
They write on the walls--
blame us for 9/11

02:27.334 --> 02:28.666
and everything else.

02:28.668 --> 02:30.668
They hate us
because they fear us.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.570
But our religion
celebrates peace.

02:32.572 --> 02:35.040
Those people only know
what they see on TV

02:35.042 --> 02:37.208
when it comes to your religion.

02:37.210 --> 02:38.343
Those few who do violence

02:38.345 --> 02:40.128
in the name of Allah
are not true Muslims,

02:40.130 --> 02:42.881
and they bring violence
upon those of us who are.

02:42.883 --> 02:46.017
And we are left unprotected.

02:46.019 --> 02:47.919
Feel the love?

02:47.921 --> 02:50.421
Well, rule number one
when I was in Fallujah:

02:50.423 --> 02:51.740
never trust Americans.

02:51.742 --> 02:54.526
Then why choose to live here
if that's how he feels?

02:54.528 --> 02:57.312
I don't know why they choose
to live here, but they do,

02:57.314 --> 02:59.280
and the sign on the door
says everyone's welcome,

02:59.282 --> 03:02.283
so we got to back
that up, partner.

<i>That mosque was vandalized</i>

03:31.479 --> 03:33.362
four times
in the past year.

03:33.364 --> 03:35.581
Graffiti, a couple
of broken windows.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.899
Any arrests?

03:36.901 --> 03:39.151
A couple of 15-year-olds--
handled in family court.

03:39.153 --> 03:41.487
Well, I doubt they
graduated to explosives.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.771
What else?

03:42.773 --> 03:44.790
Six months ago,
someone broke the lock

03:44.792 --> 03:46.409
and went to town
on the prayer room.

03:46.411 --> 03:48.044
What are we
talking about?

03:48.046 --> 03:49.378
Urinated in the fountains

03:49.380 --> 03:51.797
they use to wash their hands
before the prayers.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.215
Gee.
Mm.

03:53.217 --> 03:55.617
They also trashed the wall
facing Mecca.

03:55.619 --> 03:56.886
Wow.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.055
Well, haters gonna hate.
What?

03:59.057 --> 04:00.222
It's a figure of speech.

04:00.224 --> 04:02.058
Oh, okay.
Anything else?

04:02.060 --> 04:04.593
They also tried
to get to the Quran,

04:04.595 --> 04:06.128
but a couple
of uniforms showed up.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.897
They collar up?

04:07.899 --> 04:09.131
The perps fled,
but they tagged

04:09.133 --> 04:11.651
the floor with a
gang symbol-- a "WN"?

04:11.653 --> 04:15.604
WN? That's White Nation,
a prison skinhead gang

04:15.606 --> 04:17.690
that operates
on the outside now.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.976
They questioned the top guy,
some creep named Kevin Conklin.

04:20.978 --> 04:22.528
Priors for assault
and harassment,

04:22.530 --> 04:25.197
but he wasn't
gonna give anything up.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.333
Can't wait to meet him.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.540
Hey, did you hear
about that mosque bombing?

04:34.542 --> 04:37.093
Yeah, no shortage of
knuckleheads in the world, huh?

04:37.095 --> 04:39.328
Yeah, or in
this precinct.

04:39.330 --> 04:41.714
I heard a couple of guys
making jokes about it.

04:41.716 --> 04:42.831
Doubt they'd be laughing

04:42.833 --> 04:44.666
if it was their church
that got hit.

04:44.668 --> 04:45.718
Jamie!

04:45.720 --> 04:47.336
Hey!

04:47.338 --> 04:48.837
Hey.

04:49.806 --> 04:51.673
Hey.

04:51.675 --> 04:53.025
Um, Dana, this is my...

04:53.027 --> 04:54.443
my partner,
Eddie Janko.

04:54.445 --> 04:55.511
Great to meet you.

04:55.513 --> 04:56.946
Yeah, same... here.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.067
Uh, so how was your flight?

05:01.069 --> 05:04.203
Oversold, late taking off,
your basic nightmare.

05:04.205 --> 05:06.522
Someone should
file a class-action.

05:06.524 --> 05:08.124
(chuckles)
Dana and I went

05:08.126 --> 05:09.241
to law school together.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.127
Oh.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.415
You ready to go?
Do I have a choice?

05:17.901 --> 05:19.919
Jamie's agreed to be my date
for the bar association dinner.

05:19.921 --> 05:21.703
Which means we have
to get him a tux.

05:21.705 --> 05:24.757
(laughs)
That should be fun.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.042
It's not, but at least
there's an open bar.

05:28.211 --> 05:30.429
We should go.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.814
Okay. Um, I'll see you tomorrow.

05:31.816 --> 05:32.765
Yeah.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.734
All right.
Bye.

05:38.989 --> 05:42.074
FRANK:
<i>I understand, Mr. Mayor.</i>

05:42.076 --> 05:45.277
Well, we are investigating

05:45.279 --> 05:47.163
classifying it
as a hate crime.

05:47.165 --> 05:49.315
(hushed):
Hey-hey-hey. Ooh-ooh-ooh.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.787
But it would be premature
to call it one yet.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.088
I will keep you posted.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.957
Bye for now.

05:57.959 --> 05:59.375
I hate when you do that.

05:59.377 --> 06:00.793
What, my job?

06:00.795 --> 06:02.628
And why are you in here?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.046
The president of
the Anti-Defamation League

06:04.048 --> 06:05.464
would like to speak with you,

06:05.466 --> 06:07.516
ditto the head of
the Arab-American Association.

06:07.518 --> 06:09.268
Tell them we're doing everything
we can.

06:09.270 --> 06:12.354
And you need to reconsider
attending the CDL dinner.

06:14.924 --> 06:16.475
That again?

06:17.927 --> 06:19.612
Seriously?

06:19.614 --> 06:21.113
You're gonna blow off
a civil rights group

06:21.115 --> 06:22.698
in the wake
of an anti-Muslim hate crime?

06:22.700 --> 06:25.767
I already blew them off--

06:25.769 --> 06:27.436
assuming you told them
I wasn't available--

06:27.438 --> 06:31.657
and I will be damned
if I am going to say yes now

06:31.659 --> 06:35.911
and make it look like I am
bowing down and currying favor.

06:35.913 --> 06:38.247
Which would be

06:38.249 --> 06:41.884
the exact effect.

06:41.886 --> 06:43.636
You really want that?

06:43.638 --> 06:45.754
Well, when you put it that way.
You got another way?

06:45.756 --> 06:49.091
'Cause if you do,
I don't want to hear it!

06:50.310 --> 06:52.311
Anything else?

06:52.313 --> 06:53.813
You brief the press
in a half hour.

06:53.815 --> 06:55.514
Lucky them!

07:01.804 --> 07:03.939
Kevin Conklin?

07:03.941 --> 07:06.408
Wow, you're good.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.244
You two, why don't you
take a walk?

07:08.246 --> 07:11.163
Come on, beat it.

07:12.532 --> 07:15.000
Get up. Get your hands
out of your pockets.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.205
Someone tried to blow up
the Mosque on 10th.

07:19.207 --> 07:20.956
You know anything
about that?

07:20.958 --> 07:22.424
I know it's a good start.

07:22.426 --> 07:25.044
Too many damn Osamas
around here.

07:25.046 --> 07:26.595
Think they own the place.

07:26.597 --> 07:28.597
You were spotted in the area

07:28.599 --> 07:30.716
a few hours before
the explosion.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.434
That rat's nest
is on my way to work.

07:32.436 --> 07:34.803
Got quite a mouth on you, Kevin.

07:34.805 --> 07:37.839
You know, I got a place upstairs
that's a real mess.

07:37.841 --> 07:41.227
You got your mop and bucket
in the car, chiquita?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.863
(sighs)

07:43.865 --> 07:45.564
We have department guidelines

07:45.566 --> 07:48.200
for dealing with
verbally abusive subjects.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.870
We're supposed to find
a way to make a connection.

07:50.872 --> 07:52.988
(grunts)

07:52.990 --> 07:54.874
Well, I'd say you made
a hell of a connection there.

07:54.876 --> 07:56.692
Subject tried to put
his hands on me.

07:56.694 --> 07:57.810
I saw the whole thing.

07:57.812 --> 07:59.361
That's a damn lie!
(handcuffs clicking)

07:59.363 --> 08:01.580
Don't worry, tough guy,
we won't tell the guys

08:01.582 --> 08:04.533
that the cleaning lady
kicked your ass. Come on.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.038
(sighs)
Son of a...

08:10.040 --> 08:11.924
Partner, this guy is
shut up pretty tight.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.842
He ain't talking.
No one can place him

08:13.844 --> 08:15.877
at the scene
at the time of the bombing.

08:15.879 --> 08:17.396
We don't come up
with something quick,

08:17.398 --> 08:18.981
we're gonna have
to cut him loose.

08:18.983 --> 08:20.849
Your friend Kelly came across
a new witness

08:20.851 --> 08:23.185
during his investigation;
he wanted us to talk to her.

08:23.187 --> 08:25.321
Mrs. Sudarsky?
Yeah?

08:25.323 --> 08:27.055
This is Detective Reagan.

08:27.057 --> 08:29.575
Ma'am, can you tell us
what you saw?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.560
I-I was coming home
from the doctor.

08:31.562 --> 08:34.078
I got these gastric problems.
Don't ask.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.398
Okay.
As I passed by

08:36.400 --> 08:39.900
that mosque, I saw a guy throw
something through the window.

08:39.903 --> 08:43.621
Couple of seconds later,
I heard a loud boom.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.291
Then there was
all this screaming.

08:45.293 --> 08:48.076
Did you get a good look
at this guy?

08:48.078 --> 08:51.747
Well, I, uh... it happened fast,
but I know what I saw.

08:51.749 --> 08:54.300
Okay. Is this the guy you saw?

08:57.020 --> 08:58.687
Oh, no, that's not him.

08:59.522 --> 09:00.756
Are you sure?

09:00.758 --> 09:02.107
The guy was skinnier,

09:02.109 --> 09:04.944
but it's tough to tell
because of the robe.

09:04.946 --> 09:07.095
The robe?
What do you mean, robe?

09:07.097 --> 09:09.264
He was wearing a robe
and loose pants

09:09.266 --> 09:11.767
and one of those little hats
that they all wear.

09:11.769 --> 09:12.901
DANNY:
You saying the guy

09:12.903 --> 09:14.787
that bombed the mosque
was a Muslim?

09:14.789 --> 09:17.990
Yeah. Dark skin, beard.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.875
I remember
asking myself,

09:19.877 --> 09:23.612
why would a Muslim want
to hurt his own people?

09:23.614 --> 09:25.798
That's a damn good question.

09:39.173 --> 09:40.673
You know what
I'm talking about?

09:40.675 --> 09:42.976
You try to help,
it's like pulling teeth.

09:42.978 --> 09:45.028
Yeah, well, these people take
a lot of crap in this country.

09:45.030 --> 09:46.829
Can you blame 'em?
(men shouting)

09:46.831 --> 09:48.097
Now you're going in!
What have I done wrong?

09:48.099 --> 09:49.582
Tell me
what I've done wrong!

09:49.584 --> 09:50.683
Hey!

09:50.685 --> 09:52.085
I've done nothing.
You're under arrest!

09:52.087 --> 09:54.020
Release me immediately! Release me!
What happened?

09:54.022 --> 09:55.104
What happened here?

09:55.106 --> 09:56.489
I stopped this guy
to ask him some questions,

09:56.491 --> 09:58.992
he gets out of control,
and then he punched me.

09:58.994 --> 10:00.309
What'd you stop
him for?

10:00.311 --> 10:02.278
He fit the description.

10:03.414 --> 10:05.582
Description of this guy?

10:06.483 --> 10:08.651
You must be joking.

10:09.670 --> 10:10.920
He does have a point.

10:10.922 --> 10:12.872
He was acting furtive.

10:12.874 --> 10:14.290
I was walking down the street.

10:14.292 --> 10:15.925
I just wanted
to ask him him some questions,

10:15.927 --> 10:17.043
and he starts going off.

10:17.045 --> 10:18.211
I told him I am a Sikh.

10:18.213 --> 10:20.597
He kept insisting I'm a Muslim.

10:20.599 --> 10:23.016
Whatever you are, you assaulted
a cop, and now you're going in.

10:23.018 --> 10:24.801
I did nothing! I did nothing!

10:24.803 --> 10:27.169
Hey, both of you, take it easy!

10:27.171 --> 10:28.972
That's enough! You put
your hands on a cop,

10:28.974 --> 10:30.523
you're getting locked up;
that's the bottom line.

10:30.525 --> 10:31.841
Get him the hell out of here.

10:31.843 --> 10:33.893
This isn't right.
Get him out of here!

10:33.895 --> 10:35.194
This isn't right!

10:37.698 --> 10:39.532
Get off of me.

10:45.656 --> 10:47.323
What'd you get me?

10:47.325 --> 10:49.342
If you bring up
the CDL dinner again,

10:49.344 --> 10:50.627
I swear
I'll deck you.

10:50.629 --> 10:51.828
No, we got
real problems.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.079
One of our officers

10:53.081 --> 10:55.081
questioned a local
about his whereabouts

10:55.083 --> 10:56.249
during the bombing.

10:56.251 --> 10:57.300
And?

10:57.302 --> 10:58.367
The guy took exception,

10:58.369 --> 11:00.336
slugged the officer
and broke his nose.

11:00.338 --> 11:02.255
I assume he's in custody.

11:02.257 --> 11:03.256
Yeah.

11:03.258 --> 11:04.274
But it's complicated.

11:04.276 --> 11:06.542
The suspect is a Sikh.

11:06.544 --> 11:08.595
Claims he was racially
profiled as a Muslim.

11:08.597 --> 11:10.280
Still doesn't give
him the right

11:10.282 --> 11:11.547
to assault a police officer.

11:11.549 --> 11:12.815
No, it doesn't.

11:12.817 --> 11:15.435
But which of these

11:15.437 --> 11:18.888
is nothing like the other?

11:24.361 --> 11:25.895
Oh, boy.

11:25.897 --> 11:26.913
Seriously?

11:26.915 --> 11:28.748
And he's not
just any citizen.

11:28.750 --> 11:32.619
He is Dr. Pamar Hameed,
Chief of Neurosurgery at NYU.

11:32.621 --> 11:34.570
So what?

11:34.572 --> 11:36.255
He hit a cop
and that's against the law.

11:36.257 --> 11:37.406
Plain and simple.

11:37.408 --> 11:39.676
Well, the good news
is we finally have

11:39.678 --> 11:41.260
an excuse for skipping

11:41.262 --> 11:42.545
the Citizen's
Defense League dinner

11:42.547 --> 11:43.913
that we can both
get behind.

11:43.915 --> 11:47.433
They're filing a lawsuit
against the department

11:47.435 --> 11:50.386
for violating
Dr. Hameed's civil rights.

11:57.378 --> 11:58.378
You sure about this?

11:58.380 --> 11:59.529
Mustafa Haddad's

11:59.531 --> 12:01.047
the only Muslim we know
in this neighborhood.

12:01.049 --> 12:02.448
Who else a we
gonna talk to?

12:02.450 --> 12:04.701
But he hates non-Muslims,
especially us,

12:04.703 --> 12:05.952
after you accused
him of killing

12:05.954 --> 12:07.053
his brother's girlfriend.

12:07.055 --> 12:08.488
I'm sure he's gotten
over that by now.

12:08.490 --> 12:11.591
Besides, you got a better
idea, I'm all ears.

12:11.593 --> 12:12.892
Okay, then.

12:12.894 --> 12:15.461
Remember, they don't like women
in this place,

12:15.463 --> 12:16.963
so keep your eyes open.

12:16.965 --> 12:19.165
(Middle Eastern music playing)

12:26.557 --> 12:27.473
Mustafa.

12:27.475 --> 12:29.475
Remember us?
How could I forget?

12:29.477 --> 12:31.394
Who do you think
I killed this time?

12:31.396 --> 12:32.679
Nobody.

12:32.681 --> 12:34.564
Place seems
to be doing well.

12:34.566 --> 12:35.682
I'm the manager now.

12:35.684 --> 12:37.850
And we still don't
allow women in here.

12:37.852 --> 12:39.819
Then just think of me as a cop.

12:39.821 --> 12:41.771
We have to talk to you
about something.

12:41.773 --> 12:42.772
Let me guess.

12:42.774 --> 12:44.691
The Masjid bombing?
DANNY: Yeah.

12:44.693 --> 12:46.576
MUSTAFA:
You think I'm a terrorist now?

12:46.578 --> 12:47.977
Look, would you just...

12:47.979 --> 12:51.164
take a look at this
sketch of our suspect?

12:52.649 --> 12:54.250
Is this a joke?

12:54.252 --> 12:55.151
No, I'm afraid not.

12:55.153 --> 12:56.536
You think a Muslim
did this?

12:56.538 --> 12:58.705
We have an eyewitness
who swears to it.

12:58.707 --> 13:00.590
A white witness?

13:00.592 --> 13:01.841
You people are amazing.

13:01.843 --> 13:03.926
You lay all the evils
of the world at our feet.

13:03.928 --> 13:06.429
Why don't you just take
a look at the sketch and tell me

13:06.431 --> 13:08.214
if you've seen this guy
or if you know anyone

13:08.216 --> 13:10.666
from this community crazy enough
to pull something like this.

13:10.668 --> 13:12.268
We don't turn on our own.

13:12.270 --> 13:13.669
BAEZ: We are trying
to catch a guy

13:13.671 --> 13:15.021
who's hurting Muslims.

13:15.023 --> 13:17.356
You got as much reason as we do
to want him off the street.

13:17.358 --> 13:18.841
You have no idea
what I want.

13:18.843 --> 13:20.059
Okay, listen.

13:20.061 --> 13:22.228
Mustafa...

13:22.230 --> 13:24.781
last time I met you,
you showed me a scar.

13:24.783 --> 13:26.866
Yeah, and you still
haven't caught the guys.

13:26.868 --> 13:29.202
So you, more than anyone,
should know how it feels

13:29.204 --> 13:31.537
to see a crime against Islam
go unpunished, Mustafa.

13:31.539 --> 13:34.957
So I should help you
frame a fellow Muslim?

13:34.959 --> 13:36.359
I'm not asking you
to frame anybody.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.795
In fact, I don't give a damn
what the guy looks like

13:38.797 --> 13:40.413
or who he prays to.

13:40.415 --> 13:41.798
We caught the guy who killed

13:41.800 --> 13:43.082
your brother's girlfriend,
didn't we?

13:43.084 --> 13:44.801
He was white,
do you remember that?

13:44.803 --> 13:47.720
After eliminating every
brown suspect, including me.

13:47.722 --> 13:49.555
Sorry, detectives.

13:49.557 --> 13:51.707
You're gonna have to
do your own dirty work.

14:00.150 --> 14:01.818
(lively chatter, laughter)

14:01.820 --> 14:03.236
Look what the cat
dragged in!

14:03.238 --> 14:04.520
(crowd murmuring)

14:04.522 --> 14:06.739
Jamie Reagan!

14:06.741 --> 14:08.107
Prince Charming!
Yeah, thanks.

14:08.109 --> 14:09.742
Zip it, zip it.

14:09.744 --> 14:11.560
Where did
you go, prom?

14:11.562 --> 14:14.530
Told you I was gonna
catch hell coming in here.

14:14.532 --> 14:16.749
Oh, they're just jealous
'cause you're so damn cute.

14:16.751 --> 14:20.119
Besides, I wanted to see
where you hang out these days.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.839
Wow.

14:22.841 --> 14:24.457
Where'd you park
the wedding cake?

14:25.509 --> 14:27.960
It's not fancy, but it's cold.

14:27.962 --> 14:29.512
Oh, hey, Eddie, join us.

14:29.514 --> 14:31.964
No, I feel a little
under-dressed.

14:31.966 --> 14:33.382
Just sit down, Janko.

14:33.384 --> 14:35.084
(chuckles):
Oh.

14:35.086 --> 14:36.302
So...

14:36.304 --> 14:39.972
how was the big
lawyer shindig?

14:39.974 --> 14:40.873
Kind of like Shark Week.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.391
Come on.

14:42.393 --> 14:44.727
I thought the keynote
speaker was pretty good.

14:44.729 --> 14:46.746
"Civil Litigation
in the Internet Age."

14:46.748 --> 14:48.664
I think even the waiters
were nodding off.

14:48.666 --> 14:52.034
Oh, that sounds like that joker
from the diner the other day.

14:52.036 --> 14:53.336
Don't remind me.

14:53.338 --> 14:55.437
What happened?

14:55.439 --> 14:59.208
Oh, girlfriend here orders
a chopped salad, as usual--

14:59.210 --> 15:00.543
it's embarrassing.

15:00.545 --> 15:03.045
Not everyone puts away a steak
sandwich at lunch, Eddie.

15:03.047 --> 15:04.213
Okay, so he
tells the guy

15:04.215 --> 15:06.165
no olives,
'cause he's allergic...

15:06.167 --> 15:07.717
You're allergic to olives?

15:07.719 --> 15:08.885
Oh, big-time.

15:08.887 --> 15:10.887
Halfway through lunch,
he breaks out

15:10.889 --> 15:11.971
in these massive hives.

15:11.973 --> 15:13.973
Oh, my God.
It wasn't that bad.

15:13.975 --> 15:17.343
Turns out, the idiot waiter put
olive tapenade in his salad.

15:17.345 --> 15:20.429
So she threatens
to arrest the guy

15:20.431 --> 15:22.148
for assaulting
a police officer.

15:22.150 --> 15:24.066
I was looking out
for my partner.

15:24.068 --> 15:26.468
(laughter)

15:27.538 --> 15:29.689
Oh... (sighs)

15:29.691 --> 15:31.574
How'd that happen?

15:31.576 --> 15:33.776
I'll be right back.

15:35.078 --> 15:36.495
She's really great.

15:36.497 --> 15:38.164
Yeah.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.316
Pretty, too.

15:41.151 --> 15:42.318
Not like that, Dana.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.103
You count on your partner
to cover your back.

15:44.105 --> 15:45.321
Last thing you need is,

15:45.323 --> 15:47.340
you know, personal stuff
getting in the way of that.

15:47.342 --> 15:50.509
If you say so.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.838
Okay, thanks.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.691
Feds released our sketch
to the entire Bureau.

16:05.693 --> 16:08.227
Only hits on the West Coast
both incarcerated.

16:08.229 --> 16:09.979
Of course.

16:09.981 --> 16:12.148
Investigators have any luck
tracing the bomb parts?

16:12.150 --> 16:13.482
It was a pretty generic device.

16:13.484 --> 16:16.202
Looked at video from every
camera angle on this block.

16:16.204 --> 16:17.453
No sign of our guy.

16:17.455 --> 16:18.905
I mean,
he threw a bomb

16:18.907 --> 16:21.690
into a mosque in broad daylight,
we got an eyewitness,

16:21.692 --> 16:23.409
and still
we're chasing our tails.

16:23.411 --> 16:24.577
(phone ringing)

16:24.579 --> 16:25.578
Reagan.

16:25.580 --> 16:26.662
Yeah, Rick.

16:26.664 --> 16:28.965
What?

16:30.533 --> 16:32.001
I'm on my way.

16:32.003 --> 16:34.220
We got another bomb.
Mustafa's place, come on.

16:36.890 --> 16:38.307
(crowd murmuring)

16:38.309 --> 16:39.642
(siren whoops)

16:44.097 --> 16:45.147
DANNY:
Hey.

16:45.149 --> 16:46.882
We got to stop
meeting like this.

16:46.884 --> 16:47.900
Yeah, I wish.

16:47.902 --> 16:49.318
Same bomb as the mosque?

16:49.320 --> 16:51.153
Similar device,
as far as I can tell.

16:51.155 --> 16:52.738
And we weren't
so lucky this time.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.523
One of the vics
may not make it.

16:54.525 --> 16:57.059
Danny.
MUSTAFA: Don't touch me!

16:57.061 --> 16:58.878
I don't need your help!
Let me just check your...

16:58.880 --> 17:00.613
I told you to get
away from me!

17:00.615 --> 17:01.664
He won't let us
examine him, Detective.

17:01.666 --> 17:02.648
Tell me what happened.

17:02.650 --> 17:04.282
What happened?

17:04.285 --> 17:07.069
One second I'm talking
to my old friend,

17:07.070 --> 17:09.789
the next there's
blood... everywhere.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.207
Okay, well, there's blood
everywhere on you, too,

17:11.209 --> 17:12.425
so why don't you
let these medics

17:12.426 --> 17:13.575
help you out, okay?
Come on.

17:13.577 --> 17:14.926
Come on,
give him a hand.

17:14.929 --> 17:15.845
Help him!

17:15.847 --> 17:18.848
If you want
to help me...

17:18.849 --> 17:20.215
find who did this.

17:20.218 --> 17:23.252
Come on, just take care of him.

17:39.794 --> 17:41.294
Any word on Mustafa?

17:41.296 --> 17:42.462
He's gonna be in
the hospital overnight,

17:42.464 --> 17:43.863
but he's fine.
Lucky guy.

17:43.865 --> 17:45.832
Yeah.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.967
Luckier than his buddy,
who lost his leg,

17:47.969 --> 17:49.753
and is probably gonna
lose the other one.

17:49.755 --> 17:50.920
You come up
with anything

17:50.922 --> 17:52.472
on the names Mustafa gave us?
Yeah.

17:52.474 --> 17:55.308
Omar Khan-- attacked a guy
for kissing the cheek

17:55.310 --> 17:56.876
of an unmarried Muslim woman.

17:56.878 --> 17:58.261
Ooh, that's a no-no.

17:58.263 --> 18:01.047
Well, Omar moved to
Afghanistan last year,

18:01.049 --> 18:02.315
so he's off the list.

18:02.317 --> 18:03.767
Huh.
How about the guy

18:03.769 --> 18:05.485
who trashed the
Muslim marketplace?

18:05.487 --> 18:07.103
Yeah, Sultan Rabbani.

18:07.105 --> 18:08.188
Major dirtbag.

18:08.190 --> 18:09.906
He is doing three years
for assault.

18:09.908 --> 18:12.225
So he's no help, either.
Mm.

18:12.227 --> 18:13.409
You got something?

18:13.411 --> 18:15.662
Uh, I've been scanning
through these Web sites

18:15.664 --> 18:19.232
identified as anti-Muslim by
the hate crimes task force,

18:19.234 --> 18:21.367
looking for people logging in
using Muslim names.

18:21.369 --> 18:22.902
In case our guy
goes online

18:22.904 --> 18:24.254
trying to brag
about the bombing.

18:24.256 --> 18:25.705
Right.
You got anything?

18:25.707 --> 18:28.424
Yeah, I wrote down all
the IP addresses of one of them.

18:28.426 --> 18:30.260
This one traces back

18:30.262 --> 18:32.595
to an address located
close to both

18:32.597 --> 18:35.298
the mosque and Mustafa's place,
coincidentally.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.350
Baahir Zaki.
Yep.

18:37.352 --> 18:39.769
He started going on
the sites a few months ago.

18:39.771 --> 18:41.221
Pretty regularly.

18:41.223 --> 18:43.389
I think we should go
pay him a visit.

18:43.391 --> 18:45.591
(horn honking)

18:53.868 --> 18:55.568
I had fun at
the bar last night.

18:55.570 --> 18:56.619
Yeah, you just liked

18:56.621 --> 18:58.788
watching everybody
mock me left and right.

18:58.790 --> 19:00.240
Not at all.

19:00.242 --> 19:03.042
Well, yeah, I did a little.

19:03.044 --> 19:04.711
(laughs)

19:06.446 --> 19:07.914
So Eddie's really great.

19:07.916 --> 19:09.499
Yeah, she's
a solid partner.

19:09.501 --> 19:11.918
Oh, come on.
Wait, no.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.052
I'm serious, come on.

19:13.054 --> 19:14.554
It's like I said,
we just work together.

19:14.556 --> 19:15.755
Look, it's not
a big deal.

19:15.757 --> 19:17.623
We live on opposite sides
of the country.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.559
It's not like we're exclusive.

19:21.178 --> 19:24.013
But you do find her
attractive, right?

19:24.015 --> 19:26.232
Oh, all right.

19:28.152 --> 19:30.520
I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.

19:30.522 --> 19:32.021
Sure you did.

19:32.023 --> 19:33.740
That's okay. I got to go anyway.

19:33.742 --> 19:35.275
Got a date with Eddie.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.500
(door opens)

19:44.502 --> 19:46.485
Officer Kamins, sir.

19:47.755 --> 19:49.488
Thanks for coming.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.424
Please, sit down.

19:51.426 --> 19:52.425
Thank you, sir.

19:52.427 --> 19:53.877
(clears throat)

19:53.879 --> 19:55.178
Can I get you
some coffee?

19:55.180 --> 19:56.145
No, thank you, sir.

19:56.147 --> 19:57.597
How's the nose?

19:57.599 --> 20:01.017
A little sore,
but no big deal.

20:01.019 --> 20:03.669
Congratulations
on being cleared

20:03.671 --> 20:05.305
in the investigations.

20:05.307 --> 20:07.673
Back in uniform tomorrow.

20:07.675 --> 20:09.726
Thank you, sir.

20:11.111 --> 20:12.612
No real winners here.

20:12.614 --> 20:13.863
I'm just glad I was cleared,

20:13.865 --> 20:15.648
and the department's
not gonna take a hit.

20:15.650 --> 20:17.283
Me, too.

20:17.285 --> 20:20.620
You want to treat
people the right way.

20:20.622 --> 20:22.455
Part of the job.

20:22.457 --> 20:24.290
Big part.

20:26.126 --> 20:27.577
Between you and me?

20:27.579 --> 20:29.963
There's nobody else here.

20:29.965 --> 20:31.915
I might have had it coming.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.369
A little bit, anyway.

20:36.371 --> 20:38.254
How's that?

20:38.256 --> 20:41.707
Knowing what I know now...

20:41.709 --> 20:44.811
if I'd have been in his shoes,
I might've done the same thing.

20:44.813 --> 20:47.730
No, you wouldn't have.

20:47.732 --> 20:49.882
He punched
a New York City cop.

20:49.884 --> 20:52.568
But that instinct,

20:52.570 --> 20:55.054
to walk in someone
else's shoes?

20:55.056 --> 20:57.357
That's the most valuable
tool on your belt.

20:57.359 --> 20:58.358
Never lose it.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.944
Yes, sir.

21:00.946 --> 21:03.029
(sighs)

21:03.031 --> 21:04.563
Ever met a Sikh before?

21:04.565 --> 21:06.666
No, sir.

21:06.668 --> 21:08.067
They're proud people.

21:08.069 --> 21:09.752
They've had a hard road.

21:09.754 --> 21:11.838
But no matter
what's thrown at them,

21:11.840 --> 21:14.590
they never turn their backs
on who they are.

21:14.592 --> 21:16.209
Takes guts.

21:16.211 --> 21:18.878
Yes, sir.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.914
This is a city of immigrants.

21:21.916 --> 21:23.883
You and me included.

21:25.252 --> 21:27.186
Always remember that.

21:28.022 --> 21:29.422
I will, sir.

21:29.424 --> 21:31.257
Thank you.

21:31.259 --> 21:33.142
Thank you, sir.

21:36.697 --> 21:38.597
(door opens)

21:38.599 --> 21:40.867
MAN: <i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>how I can help you, Detectives.</i>

21:40.869 --> 21:43.987
We're talking to people
in the neighborhood, Mr. Zaki.

21:43.989 --> 21:46.205
See if anyone knows anything
about the bombings.

21:46.207 --> 21:48.541
I only know what I've read
in the newspapers.

21:48.543 --> 21:50.243
It's terrible.
No thanks.

21:50.245 --> 21:52.412
We understand you're a member
of the mosque that was bombed?

21:52.414 --> 21:53.579
Yes.

21:53.581 --> 21:55.381
But you weren't there
when the bomb went off.

21:55.383 --> 21:57.467
Allah is good.

21:57.469 --> 21:58.885
Well, that's not what they say
on that Web site

21:58.887 --> 21:59.886
you've been hanging out on.

21:59.888 --> 22:02.171
A friend sent me the link.

22:02.173 --> 22:04.007
Mm-hmm.
It's frightening

22:04.009 --> 22:05.508
how many people hate Muslims.

22:05.510 --> 22:07.427
Yet you've been on that site
over a dozen times.

22:07.429 --> 22:09.512
What are you implying?

22:09.514 --> 22:11.514
Are you investigating me?

22:11.516 --> 22:12.515
Should we be?

22:12.517 --> 22:13.983
I was at my office

22:13.985 --> 22:16.235
when the Masjid and Safad's
were bombed.

22:16.237 --> 22:17.303
WOMAN:
Baahir?

22:17.305 --> 22:18.855
GIRL:
Daddy!

22:18.857 --> 22:22.358
Sudi needs help
with her... homework.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.476
Is everything all right?

22:23.478 --> 22:24.694
Everything's fine.

22:24.696 --> 22:27.146
Detectives, this is
my wife Aaliya.

22:27.148 --> 22:28.865
And my daughter Sudi.

22:28.867 --> 22:30.283
Detectives, this is
You're the police?Aaliya.

22:30.285 --> 22:31.417
Yes, ma'am.

22:31.419 --> 22:34.454
And, uh, we were
just leaving.

22:34.456 --> 22:36.005
I wish I could be more help.

22:36.007 --> 22:39.492
You've already been
plenty of help, Mr. Zaki.

22:44.848 --> 22:45.932
So, what do you think?

22:45.934 --> 22:47.467
I think he's lying
through his teeth.

22:47.469 --> 22:49.335
Wife seems like she knows
something's going on.

22:49.337 --> 22:50.853
I would agree with
that assessment.

22:50.855 --> 22:52.338
So, why not ask her
some questions?

22:52.340 --> 22:54.040
'Cause a Muslim woman's
never gonna talk

22:54.042 --> 22:55.691
about her husband to strangers.

22:55.693 --> 22:57.944
At least not
while he's in the room.

23:02.066 --> 23:03.566
(clicks tongue)

23:03.568 --> 23:05.118
(sighs)

23:05.120 --> 23:06.903
Church was crowded this morning.

23:06.905 --> 23:08.538
Well, Christmas rush.

23:08.540 --> 23:12.325
Everybody want to wipe the
slate clean this time of year.

23:12.327 --> 23:15.661
How you holding up with
everything that's going on?

23:15.663 --> 23:18.381
Ah, sixes and sevens.

23:18.383 --> 23:20.466
Your cop Kamins?

23:20.468 --> 23:23.086
Actually, the guy who hit him.

23:23.088 --> 23:24.637
Well, we have him
airtight, Dad.

23:24.639 --> 23:27.256
Even he doesn't dispute
what happened.

23:27.258 --> 23:29.425
Well, he may not
dispute what happened,

23:29.427 --> 23:32.979
but I'm pretty sure he feels
he had the right.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.551
You know, I don't think I know
who's right or wrong here.

23:38.553 --> 23:41.187
Will wonders never cease?

23:41.189 --> 23:43.439
What charges is
your office gonna pursue?

23:43.441 --> 23:45.658
Well, ven the extent
of Officer Kamins' injuries,

23:45.660 --> 23:48.060
assault two
and resisting arrest.

23:50.197 --> 23:51.864
Sounds pretty harsh.

23:51.866 --> 23:54.083
Excuse me?

23:54.085 --> 23:58.070
Dr. Hameed is a model citizen
with no prior record.

23:58.072 --> 24:02.408
Officer Kamins is a good cop
with a spotless record.

24:03.460 --> 24:06.012
I'm not so sure
the farther this goes,

24:06.014 --> 24:07.547
the more damage is done.

24:07.549 --> 24:10.349
An NYPD officer is assaulted.

24:10.351 --> 24:12.135
And the PC is asking us

24:12.137 --> 24:15.521
to reduce the charges
on the perp?

24:17.757 --> 24:19.592
What I think I'm saying

24:19.594 --> 24:23.529
is maybe the D.A.'s office could
look at this for what it is.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.600
Two wrongs that cancel
each other out.

24:29.119 --> 24:32.705
Does anybody bomb
Catholic churches?

24:32.707 --> 24:34.824
Oh, I don't think you have
to worry about that, honey.

24:34.826 --> 24:36.742
He's just trying to get
out of catechism class.

24:36.744 --> 24:37.793
Am not.

24:37.795 --> 24:38.911
Are, too.

24:38.913 --> 24:40.246
All right, knock it off.

24:40.248 --> 24:42.948
The answer is yes,
but not here-- knock wood.

24:42.950 --> 24:44.300
Really? Where?

24:44.302 --> 24:45.451
Lately?

24:45.453 --> 24:48.621
Pakistan, Nigeria,
Northern Ireland.

24:48.623 --> 24:50.006
Other places, too.

24:51.124 --> 24:52.391
Why does God allow it?

24:52.393 --> 24:53.676
Doesn't work that way, Jack.

24:53.678 --> 24:56.128
It's done in the name of God,
believe it or not.

24:56.130 --> 24:57.630
You mean, like
in the name of Allah?

24:57.632 --> 24:59.849
Not always.

24:59.851 --> 25:01.133
In Northern Ireland anyway,
in the name

25:01.135 --> 25:02.818
of the exact same God
that we pray to.

25:02.820 --> 25:03.802
By other Christians.

25:03.804 --> 25:05.605
So-called Christians.

25:05.607 --> 25:07.806
This is really confusing.

25:07.808 --> 25:09.108
It certainly is.

25:09.110 --> 25:10.243
DANNY: And that's why
they have a class

25:10.245 --> 25:12.478
dedicated to it in school
called history.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.746
Not really.

25:13.748 --> 25:15.615
JAMIE: Are you
sure about that?

25:15.617 --> 25:17.250
You ever study the Crusades?

25:17.252 --> 25:18.618
Oh, yeah.

25:18.620 --> 25:20.369
Birth of Israel?

25:20.371 --> 25:22.872
The 30 Years War in Europe?
Okay, okay.

25:22.874 --> 25:25.958
There's been a lot of good done
in the name of God.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.010
And a lot of bad, also.

25:28.012 --> 25:30.096
Yeah, what my father
used to say:

25:30.098 --> 25:32.465
a lot of wars basically
boil down to somebody saying,

25:32.467 --> 25:35.968
"I'm taking your house
and God said it was okay."

25:37.638 --> 25:39.605
Hmm.

25:41.608 --> 25:42.858
I'm gonna hang back.

25:42.860 --> 25:44.961
She's not gonna talk to me.
Okay.

25:46.113 --> 25:46.996
Mrs. Zaki?

25:48.565 --> 25:50.483
Detectives.

25:50.485 --> 25:54.019
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

25:54.021 --> 25:55.871
Is this about my husband?

25:55.873 --> 25:57.523
Yes, ma'am.

25:57.525 --> 25:59.492
Baahir is a good man.

25:59.494 --> 26:01.294
No one's saying he's not.

26:01.296 --> 26:03.412
Then why are you treating
him like a criminal?

26:03.414 --> 26:05.030
Someone in this community
is hurting people.

26:05.032 --> 26:07.032
And it doesn't seem
like they intend to stop.

26:07.034 --> 26:09.335
Baahir isn't like that.

26:09.337 --> 26:11.003
He's an educated man.

26:11.005 --> 26:12.672
He programs computer

26:12.674 --> 26:14.140
Yes, at Dineen Technologies.

26:14.142 --> 26:15.508
We called them.

26:15.510 --> 26:17.810
They said your husband
was laid off six months ago.

26:17.812 --> 26:20.813
Yes, the company is downsizing.

26:20.815 --> 26:22.598
It must be tough.

26:24.384 --> 26:28.404
Especially because his
father is very ill.

26:28.406 --> 26:30.156
The hospital bills...

26:30.158 --> 26:32.992
Sounds like your husband's
under a lot of stress.

26:32.994 --> 26:36.195
Allah will provide.

26:36.197 --> 26:38.497
Is that
how Baahir feels?

26:38.499 --> 26:41.867
He spent a few weeks at a
psychiatric hospital last year.

26:41.869 --> 26:45.204
It was a very difficult time.

26:49.843 --> 26:53.129
Please, I love Baahir.

26:53.131 --> 26:56.248
Then help him
by telling us the truth.

26:58.585 --> 27:01.086
Baahir's faith was strong.

27:01.088 --> 27:03.723
But when things
started going badly,

27:03.725 --> 27:05.608
he stopped going to prayers.

27:05.610 --> 27:09.061
He started
acting strangely.

27:09.063 --> 27:11.480
He felt that...

27:11.482 --> 27:13.649
Allah had abandoned him.

27:16.453 --> 27:19.455
That Allah's
benevolence was a lie.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.496
This is a man I don't know.

27:27.498 --> 27:30.466
He said he was at his office
when the bombs went off.

27:30.468 --> 27:32.218
But if he got laid off...

27:32.220 --> 27:35.805
H-He's been working at
his father's apartment...

27:35.807 --> 27:39.258
repairing computers
until he finds a new job.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.060
We're gonna need
his father's address.

27:41.062 --> 27:42.895
Please...

27:42.897 --> 27:45.130
Baahir would
never hurt anyone.

27:45.132 --> 27:46.899
I hope you're right.

27:53.907 --> 27:55.858
You're doing
the right thing.

28:08.822 --> 28:11.290
DANNY:
Baahir Zaki?

28:11.292 --> 28:13.459
We're coming in.

28:16.380 --> 28:18.547
Watch yourself.

28:22.102 --> 28:24.103
Danny!

28:24.105 --> 28:26.305
Back here.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.976
Son of a bitch.

28:33.947 --> 28:36.198
He's got enough explosives
to blow up the block.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.234
We got to get this place
evacuated, partner.

28:38.236 --> 28:39.652
I'll call the bomb squad.

28:39.654 --> 28:40.820
No, no, no, no!

28:40.822 --> 28:42.405
No cell phone.

28:42.407 --> 28:44.407
Find a neighbor,
use a landline.

28:47.411 --> 28:48.577
Danny?

28:48.579 --> 28:51.630
Found this.

28:51.632 --> 28:53.833
Muslim Day Parade?
You don't think...

28:53.835 --> 28:56.919
I hope not,
'cause the parade's tomorrow.

29:09.294 --> 29:11.545
(indistinct chatter)

29:14.832 --> 29:17.017
Focus on the start
and the end of the parade.

29:17.351 --> 29:18.850
That's where
the largest concentration

29:18.852 --> 29:20.936
of spectators is gonna be.

29:20.938 --> 29:22.020
How long till this thing starts?

29:22.022 --> 29:23.689
There are gonna be
thousands of people here.

29:23.691 --> 29:25.490
Starts in three hours.

29:25.492 --> 29:27.676
We're not even sure
if Baahir planted the bombs yet.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.678
Well, that's why they
haven't shut it down.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.363
Hear anything
from the wife?

29:31.365 --> 29:33.615
Zaki never came home
last night.

29:33.617 --> 29:34.866
He's not answering
his cell phone.

29:34.868 --> 29:37.152
We have a team posted
at the hospital

29:37.154 --> 29:38.670
in case he shows up
to visit his father.

29:38.672 --> 29:39.854
He couldn't be
that stupid.

29:39.856 --> 29:41.573
Reagan.

29:41.575 --> 29:44.710
You're kidding me.

29:44.712 --> 29:45.961
All right, we're on our way.

29:45.963 --> 29:47.295
I guess he is that stupid.

29:47.297 --> 29:48.714
He showed up at the hospital.

29:48.716 --> 29:51.500
They're bringing him
down to the squad now.

29:53.670 --> 29:55.971
So, Dana's pretty cool.

29:56.856 --> 29:58.507
How come you never
mentioned her before?

29:58.509 --> 30:00.676
It's kind of an on-again,
off-again thing.

30:00.678 --> 30:03.228
Sure seemed like an "on thing"
the other night.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.180
Yeah, I guess.
At least you and Dana have

30:05.182 --> 30:08.233
the whole lawyer thing
going on, right?

30:08.235 --> 30:12.354
Maybe, but didn't keep her
from being jealous of you.

30:12.356 --> 30:13.188
What?

30:13.190 --> 30:15.023
That's ridiculous.

30:15.025 --> 30:16.241
That's what I said.

30:16.243 --> 30:18.276
I mean, even
if we weren't partners,

30:18.278 --> 30:20.946
you are nowhere near my type.

30:20.948 --> 30:22.364
Uh, ditto.

30:22.366 --> 30:23.615
You're way too short.

30:23.617 --> 30:26.084
And our family backgrounds?

30:26.086 --> 30:28.870
Not compatible.

30:28.872 --> 30:31.006
Yeah, I guess, uh,
a family of cops

30:31.008 --> 30:33.508
wouldn't go down too well
at the, uh, country club, huh?

30:33.510 --> 30:34.710
That's not what I meant.

30:34.712 --> 30:36.378
Whatever.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.580
No.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.553
My father was
a financial adviser,

30:44.555 --> 30:47.472
and he made a lot of money.

30:48.725 --> 30:50.192
But it was all a lie.

30:50.194 --> 30:52.060
What are you talking about?

30:52.062 --> 30:53.695
Remember Bernie Madoff?

30:54.530 --> 30:56.097
That's my dad.

30:56.099 --> 30:59.934
On a-a smaller scale.

30:59.936 --> 31:04.823
His... company turned out
to be a Ponzi scheme.

31:04.825 --> 31:06.608
And a lot
of really good people

31:06.610 --> 31:10.295
lost... everything.

31:10.297 --> 31:12.581
People I knew my whole life.

31:18.221 --> 31:20.005
What happened to your dad?

31:20.007 --> 31:23.759
He's doing six to eight
in Fort Dix Correctional.

31:23.761 --> 31:25.260
I haven't spoken
to him in, like,

31:25.262 --> 31:27.179
three years.

31:27.181 --> 31:29.297
See, Reagan,
it's not your family

31:29.299 --> 31:31.116
that's not good enough.

31:31.118 --> 31:32.934
It's mine.

31:32.936 --> 31:35.387
DISPATCHER (over radio):
All available units

31:35.389 --> 31:36.471
respond to 32nd and First,

31:36.473 --> 31:38.156
for the evacuation,
Muslim Day Parade.

31:38.158 --> 31:39.441
Units responding.

31:44.781 --> 31:46.081
How's your father, Baahir?

31:46.083 --> 31:47.699
He's dying.

31:47.701 --> 31:49.751
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:49.753 --> 31:51.086
Life is full of sorrow.

31:51.088 --> 31:52.821
Sometimes death is a gift.

31:52.823 --> 31:55.207
Like the gift you're planning
for the parade today?

31:55.209 --> 31:56.658
DANNY:
Come on.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.043
We visited your workshop.

31:58.928 --> 32:00.345
You planted the bombs,
didn't you?

32:00.347 --> 32:01.296
Yes.

32:01.298 --> 32:03.632
If Allah is as great
as he claims,

32:03.634 --> 32:05.433
he will intervene.

32:06.886 --> 32:08.887
Have dispatch
call One PP.

32:08.889 --> 32:10.305
We got to shut the
parade down now.

32:10.307 --> 32:11.306
That's gonna
take some time.

32:11.308 --> 32:12.557
Make it happen.

32:20.566 --> 32:23.618
Why don't you tell me where
those devices are, Baahir.

32:23.620 --> 32:27.355
Where only the Most Merciful
can find them.

32:27.357 --> 32:28.824
It's in his hands now.

32:28.826 --> 32:30.408
Don't give me that crap.

32:30.410 --> 32:31.660
It's in your hands now.

32:31.662 --> 32:32.611
All my life,

32:32.613 --> 32:35.247
I've struggled to be
a good Muslim,

32:35.249 --> 32:39.551
to provide for my family
and to serve Allah.

32:39.553 --> 32:41.002
I was promised

32:41.004 --> 32:44.055
that if I did these things,
God would provide.

32:44.057 --> 32:45.807
He hasn't.

32:45.809 --> 32:49.311
My people need to understand

32:49.313 --> 32:51.096
they're on their own.

32:56.936 --> 32:59.154
Okay.

33:01.390 --> 33:03.057
This is where
I find peace.

33:03.059 --> 33:04.943
Like my boys?

33:04.945 --> 33:07.162
They mean everything to me.

33:07.164 --> 33:08.663
My boys.

33:08.665 --> 33:10.115
Now, let's just say

33:10.117 --> 33:12.450
that they're down at
that parade right now,

33:12.452 --> 33:14.119
not knowing that
they're about to be

33:14.121 --> 33:17.238
blown to bits
by a couple of bombs.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.257
As a father
and as a man,

33:19.259 --> 33:21.293
can you imagine
what it's gonna be like

33:21.295 --> 33:23.178
for me to lose my children?

33:44.767 --> 33:46.701
Then maybe you can
imagine what it's gonna

33:46.703 --> 33:48.269
feel like to
lose your own.

33:49.906 --> 33:51.573
Hi, Daddy.

33:51.575 --> 33:53.541
Hello, angel.

33:53.543 --> 33:54.876
You okay?

33:56.879 --> 33:59.080
Go see your papa.

34:04.053 --> 34:06.504
Tell me where
the bombs are, Baahir.

34:06.506 --> 34:09.139
(sobs)

34:09.141 --> 34:10.675
Help me, please.

34:10.677 --> 34:12.793
(crying):
Okay.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.982
I'll help you.

34:16.984 --> 34:19.100
But you only have
19 minutes.

34:20.820 --> 34:22.270
(sirens wailing)

34:22.272 --> 34:24.155
DANNY: <i>Have the Bomb Squad</i>
<i>respond to the bandstand.</i>

34:24.157 --> 34:26.474
<i>The bomb is in</i>
<i>one of the speakers.</i>

34:28.911 --> 34:30.978
OFFICER: Let's go!
(people shouting)

34:30.981 --> 34:33.598
I want this area clear, now!

34:36.150 --> 34:37.335
Move!

35:02.645 --> 35:04.779
(indistinct radio chatter)

35:04.781 --> 35:07.065
(clamoring)

35:36.562 --> 35:38.313
♪

35:54.697 --> 35:56.865
All clear, guys.

35:58.067 --> 36:00.502
Nice going, partner.

36:00.504 --> 36:02.420
Hem du'Allah.

36:02.422 --> 36:04.589
Thank God.

36:16.752 --> 36:17.719
Mustafa.

36:17.721 --> 36:19.804
Detective Reagan.

36:19.806 --> 36:21.973
You look a lot better than
the last time I saw you.

36:21.975 --> 36:23.641
Hmm.

36:23.643 --> 36:25.226
It only hurts
when I breathe.

36:25.228 --> 36:26.478
Right.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.812
What brings you down here?

36:27.814 --> 36:29.614
I heard what
you did today.

36:29.616 --> 36:32.283
You mean my job?

36:32.285 --> 36:36.488
You know, sometimes,
when people are different,

36:36.490 --> 36:37.956
they create a world

36:37.958 --> 36:39.774
separate from the world
they live in...

36:40.943 --> 36:43.244
...to protect themselves.

36:43.246 --> 36:46.131
I can understand that.

36:46.133 --> 36:50.001
Though sometimes, not everyone's
trying to hurt you, you know.

36:50.003 --> 36:51.920
Some of us actually
want to help.

36:58.928 --> 36:59.894
What's this?

36:59.896 --> 37:02.764
It's a verse from
a Sufi poem.

37:02.766 --> 37:06.234
It's about friends...

37:06.236 --> 37:09.737
coming from...
unexpected places.

37:12.658 --> 37:14.609
Well, thanks.

37:14.611 --> 37:16.528
Be well, Detective.

37:16.530 --> 37:18.947
You, too.

37:24.753 --> 37:26.921
(sighs)

37:40.219 --> 37:42.170
(door opens)

37:48.978 --> 37:50.111
Dr. Hameed.

37:50.113 --> 37:52.147
Frank Reagan.

37:52.149 --> 37:54.149
I was surprised to get
your call, Commissioner.

37:54.151 --> 37:56.901
I felt privacy was in order.

37:56.903 --> 37:58.036
Ex-cop owns this bar.

37:58.038 --> 38:01.656
Intoxicants are
forbidden in my faith.

38:01.658 --> 38:05.160
I took the liberty
of having tea prepared.

38:07.079 --> 38:08.079
Please.

38:08.081 --> 38:10.298
Thank you.

38:12.701 --> 38:14.886
But before I accept
your hospitality,

38:14.888 --> 38:18.406
I should let you know that
my lawsuit is going ahead.

38:18.408 --> 38:22.043
I can't say I'm surprised.

38:23.395 --> 38:26.064
I am aware of the harassment,

38:26.066 --> 38:27.548
and worse,

38:27.550 --> 38:30.602
that your faith
and traditions visit on you.

38:30.604 --> 38:32.654
I imagine a man
of your intelligence

38:32.656 --> 38:35.890
would not want to waste
the opportunity

38:35.892 --> 38:38.943
to shine a light
on those injustices.

38:40.362 --> 38:42.297
(sighs)

38:42.299 --> 38:43.898
Can I ask a stupid question?

38:43.900 --> 38:46.751
I-I don't want
to embarrass you.

38:46.753 --> 38:48.870
I'm not easily
embarrassed.

38:48.872 --> 38:50.705
Well...

38:50.707 --> 38:53.675
when we were kids,

38:53.677 --> 38:56.878
I was told Sikhs carry
daggers in their turbans.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.080
(chuckles)

39:09.308 --> 39:10.942
Okay.

39:10.944 --> 39:13.244
The Kirpan is one of our
five articles of faith.

39:13.246 --> 39:14.979
As a neurosurgeon,

39:14.981 --> 39:18.099
I advise against wearing
it in one's turban.

39:22.288 --> 39:23.621
I was grateful that

39:23.623 --> 39:25.039
the district attorney
reduced the charges.

39:25.041 --> 39:28.042
If that has anything to do
with your department...

39:28.044 --> 39:30.078
It did not.

39:30.080 --> 39:34.415
Then I guess a "thank you"
would be out of line.

39:36.719 --> 39:39.671
I was happy it was reduced
to a misdemeanor.

39:43.392 --> 39:46.294
Dr. Hameed...

39:46.296 --> 39:48.846
my officer was
trying to do his job.

39:48.848 --> 39:51.349
But his judgment
was off,

39:51.351 --> 39:52.633
and in the process,

39:52.635 --> 39:55.320
he insulted a good man
and his heritage.

39:55.322 --> 39:56.804
And that's wrong.

40:02.477 --> 40:05.196
(sighs)

40:05.198 --> 40:08.333
I came here to apologize,

40:08.335 --> 40:12.870
on behalf of my men,
my department and me.

40:24.099 --> 40:27.101
Dr. Hameed...

40:27.103 --> 40:29.103
Officer Bob Kamins.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.985
I know you two have met.

40:43.987 --> 40:47.855
I just felt you both
deserved a do-over.
