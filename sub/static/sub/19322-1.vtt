01:04.298 --> 01:06.498
           -What's up?          

01:08.269 --> 01:11.603
    -Well, I have a client      
    with a little problem.      

01:13.074 --> 01:16.608
         -I figured.            
      Who's the client?         

01:16.610 --> 01:19.244
    -You know Jeff Schaefer?    

01:19.246 --> 01:21.847
   -Jeff Schaefer. Oh, yeah,    
    the pharmaceutical guy.     

01:21.849 --> 01:23.048
             -Yeah.             

01:23.050 --> 01:25.851
-So, what do you want from me,  
            huh?                

01:25.853 --> 01:28.253
  -I need you to hook me up     
   with one of your guys.       

01:28.255 --> 01:32.224
    -Come on, Luke. Come on.    

01:32.226 --> 01:34.159
   What happened to your big,   
       bad motherfucker,        

01:34.161 --> 01:35.928
        Ronald, your boy?       

01:35.930 --> 01:37.529
    -Honestly, I don't know.    

01:37.531 --> 01:39.231
  Usually, he'd be all over     
    something like this.        

01:39.233 --> 01:41.767
But he's not calling me back,   
            so...               

01:41.769 --> 01:43.869
    -That's why I'm here.       
        -You know...            

01:43.871 --> 01:46.305
    I don't know if I should    
 take it as a compliment or not.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.740
      But it's always           
   really good to see you.      

02:00.154 --> 02:02.554
        (tapping on wood)       

02:03.891 --> 02:06.058
        -(woman crying)         
 JEFF: Leave her out of this.   

02:06.060 --> 02:07.493
    -What'd you think, homey?   

02:07.495 --> 02:09.928
     You thought we were        
just gonna walk away or what?   

02:09.930 --> 02:12.297
 -You want to shoot somebody,   
  shoot me, you motherfucker.   

02:12.299 --> 02:14.266
       Shoot me, you fuck.      

02:16.971 --> 02:18.570
-Aw, shit, it's going to be fun.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.838
        (gasping loudly)        

02:22.276 --> 02:24.576
       (breathing heavily)      

02:25.713 --> 02:27.913
           (Kim moans)          

02:30.484 --> 02:32.918
  -Happy anniversary, my love.  

02:42.496 --> 02:44.129
  -All right, just make sure    
      everything's set up       

02:44.131 --> 02:45.564
         when we arrive.        

02:45.566 --> 02:46.798
          Last time,            
     was a bit of a mess.       

02:46.800 --> 02:48.934
    It was like one thing       
       after another--          

02:48.936 --> 02:50.235
    you know what I'm saying.   

02:50.237 --> 02:51.637
         -(over phone)          
   Of course, Mr. Schaefer.     

02:51.639 --> 02:53.372
       You've nothing           
       to worry about.          

02:53.374 --> 02:55.040
        Let me handle           
  all of those particulars.     

02:55.042 --> 02:56.875
        It's about time         
     you took a vacation.       

03:15.362 --> 03:17.329
   -Okay, and don't forget      
      this is a secret,         

03:17.331 --> 03:19.531
   so just keep it between      
      me and you, okay?         

03:19.533 --> 03:21.500
     -Yes, sir. However,        
  I just want to remind you     

03:21.502 --> 03:23.835
about the Autism Speaks event   
       this Saturday.           

03:39.520 --> 03:41.620
            (moaning)           

03:52.433 --> 03:55.067
     -Looks like somebody       
      made you breakfast.       

03:55.069 --> 03:57.502
        (both chuckling)        

04:00.307 --> 04:04.109
     -God, you're the best.     

04:04.111 --> 04:05.711
            (sighing)           

04:07.314 --> 04:09.248
    Happy anniversary, baby.    

04:10.184 --> 04:12.317
     -Happy anniversary,        
          my love.              

04:17.690 --> 04:20.192
-You ever cheat on your wife,   
        Mr. Schaefer?           

04:20.194 --> 04:22.828
       -Cheat on my wife?       

04:22.830 --> 04:25.664
You just interviewed my wife.   
       She's gorgeous.          

04:25.666 --> 04:27.132
            I mean,             
  I couldn't even pay a girl    

04:27.134 --> 04:28.533
    half as good to fuck me.    

04:28.535 --> 04:30.469
  No, I don't cheat on my wife. 

04:30.471 --> 04:32.871
     -We met your secretary.    

04:32.873 --> 04:35.374
        -Very pretty.           
            -Hmm.               

04:37.211 --> 04:39.411
        -What kind of           
  fucking question is that?     

04:40.781 --> 04:42.514
      -Well, did it ever        
       cross your mind,         

04:42.516 --> 04:44.750
     I mean, once or twice?     

04:44.752 --> 04:51.857
     -Listen, I don't mean      
  to be disrespectful, okay.    

04:51.859 --> 04:57.162
       But I have never,        
or never will cheat on my wife. 

04:57.164 --> 04:59.298
          -Okay, okay.          

05:02.036 --> 05:05.404
-You know, I might have a couple
  of little surprises for you.  

05:05.406 --> 05:08.173
            -Woo.               
        -(Kim laughs)           

05:08.175 --> 05:09.941
    What are you up to, hmm?    

05:11.412 --> 05:12.911
       -Here's number one.      

05:14.214 --> 05:15.614
            (sighing)           

05:16.417 --> 05:18.583
          -Oh, my God.          

05:20.554 --> 05:23.021
         -You didn't.           
            -I did.             

05:28.495 --> 05:30.562
         Oh, my god.            
         (chuckling)            

05:41.275 --> 05:43.342
        -You remembered.        

05:43.344 --> 05:44.876
       -Of course, I did.       

05:48.916 --> 05:50.982
 You know, I can take it back   
     if you don't like it.      

05:50.984 --> 05:53.485
         -No. I love it.        

05:53.487 --> 05:54.953
           Thank you.           

05:57.758 --> 05:59.624
      -So I'm going to          
      hop in the shower         

05:59.626 --> 06:01.660
       and get to work          
   and pay for this, okay?      

06:03.497 --> 06:05.597
    -How did I get so lucky?    

06:07.167 --> 06:09.568
  -I ask myself that every day. 

06:11.004 --> 06:13.238
       You put that on          
and eat your breakfast, okay?   

06:13.240 --> 06:15.307
       -Be a good girl.         
             -Hmm.              

06:15.309 --> 06:17.576
           Never.               
         (chuckling)            

06:25.185 --> 06:26.985
         (phone ringing)        

06:29.590 --> 06:31.056
         -This is Gregg.        

06:31.058 --> 06:33.925
     -(sighing) Hey, Gregg.     
    It's, um, Jeff Schaefer.    

06:33.927 --> 06:35.527
         I don't know           
       if you remember.         

06:35.529 --> 06:36.962
    I used your services        
 back a couple of years ago.    

06:36.964 --> 06:38.997
       I was looking to         
      acquire a company.        

06:38.999 --> 06:42.033
 -Oh, sure. Hello, Mr. Schaefer.
          How are you?          

06:43.070 --> 06:45.036
       -I've been better.       

06:45.038 --> 06:46.738
      -Well, you're alive.      

06:46.740 --> 06:48.640
       I'd say that's--         
    That counts for a lot.      

06:48.642 --> 06:50.142
       How can I help you?      

06:50.144 --> 06:55.347
   I'm going to need you to     
     keep tabs on my wife.      

06:55.349 --> 06:58.250
         -You mean,             
        your ex-wife?           

06:58.252 --> 06:59.651
    -Oh, no, my current wife.   

06:59.653 --> 07:01.753
        I think there's         
      a possibility that        

07:01.755 --> 07:04.055
    she might be involved       
    in some indiscretions       

07:04.057 --> 07:05.690
 and I just want to make sure   
         before I take          

07:05.692 --> 07:07.426
     any unnecessary action.    

07:11.799 --> 07:14.299
    -Hurry up. Your boss        
 is going to get mad at you.    

07:14.301 --> 07:16.268
           (chuckling)          

07:16.270 --> 07:17.669
       -I am the boss.          
        -(chuckling)            

07:17.671 --> 07:19.371
         -Bye-bye, babe.        

07:19.373 --> 07:21.106
         -See you, sexy.        

07:30.484 --> 07:33.585
      (humming cheerfully)      

07:39.927 --> 07:42.060
           JONES:               
  Why would you think that?     

07:42.062 --> 07:45.530
  TERRY: I'm his assistant.     
 I pay his credit card bill.    

07:45.532 --> 07:48.467
 Every time he goes to Vegas,   
  he's got all these charges    

07:48.469 --> 07:50.135
 from escort companies.         

07:50.137 --> 07:52.170
  The weekend he meets Kim,     
       it's different.          

07:52.172 --> 07:54.673
   There's only one charge      
      to a new company          

07:54.675 --> 07:56.475
      and it's for like         
     five times the rate        

07:56.477 --> 07:58.710
     of the other companies.    

07:58.712 --> 08:04.549
   So I-- I clear the charge    
with Mr. Schaefer and he says,  

08:04.551 --> 08:08.153
Oh, it's-- It's just, just some,
you know, some admission fee,   

08:08.155 --> 08:09.788
     to some private party.     

08:09.790 --> 08:13.692
 Plus, I mean, have you seen    
    the way she dresses?        

08:28.575 --> 08:30.075
        (car lock beeps)        

08:40.187 --> 08:41.620
     -You believe this guy?     

08:42.655 --> 08:43.855
       -What do you mean?       

08:43.857 --> 08:45.757
  -I mean, do you believe him   

08:45.759 --> 08:48.326
         and his whole          
   "my life is great" shit?     

08:48.328 --> 08:51.563
 I mean, he must have known that
  his wife was cheating on him. 

08:51.565 --> 08:52.864
  He's not that big of a dummy. 

08:52.866 --> 08:54.566
       He doesn't seem          
      that way, anyway.         

08:54.568 --> 08:56.735
  -I don't know, to be honest.  

08:56.737 --> 08:58.537
      I mean, he could,         
       but then what?           

08:58.539 --> 08:59.771
     I mean, you're gonna       
         put this guy           

08:59.773 --> 09:01.172
  to being a possible murderer  

09:01.174 --> 09:03.441
    because he lied to us       
about his wife being a whore?   

09:03.443 --> 09:07.746
     -No, but he could have     
 put a hit out on the boyfriend.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.782
  Or, they could've done it     
      together on some          

09:10.784 --> 09:13.451
        sick, twisted,          
     fantasy sexual shit.       

09:13.453 --> 09:15.387
  I mean, that kind of stuff    
     happens all the time,      

09:15.389 --> 09:17.155
   especially in their world.   

09:17.157 --> 09:18.557
     I mean, think about it.    

09:18.559 --> 09:20.725
He could've been cheating on her
      and she cheats on him     

09:20.727 --> 09:22.327
    and it's their thing,       
          their MO,             

09:22.329 --> 09:26.164
 and suddenly, the poor kid's   
     throat gets slashed.       

09:31.238 --> 09:32.704
-Sounds a little far-fetched.   
          -Come on.             

09:32.706 --> 09:35.173
       -Really, really?         
        -Not that far.          

09:35.175 --> 09:36.575
     -To be honest with you,    

09:36.577 --> 09:38.777
     he doesn't seem like       
 the murderer type, you know.   

09:38.779 --> 09:41.146
          -He doesn't?          
    -Yeah, too much to lose.    

09:42.983 --> 09:44.549
   -So you got a guy for me?    

09:44.551 --> 09:47.886
-You know, I charge a connect   
 fee for this type of thing.    

09:47.888 --> 09:49.721
         -Of course.            
     There's no problem.        

09:49.723 --> 09:51.423
           -Okay.               
   -Money is not a factor.      

09:51.425 --> 09:54.292
         -No? Hmm, okay.        

09:54.294 --> 09:56.728
      What about Jose, man?     

09:56.730 --> 09:57.929
         You know Jose?         

09:57.931 --> 10:00.932
     -56th Street, Jose?        
            -Yes.               

10:02.569 --> 10:04.069
       -He's out already?       

10:06.039 --> 10:07.739
           -He's out.           

10:17.417 --> 10:19.618
          -Please wait.         

10:21.488 --> 10:22.954
           Come here.           

10:23.757 --> 10:25.156
           Come here.           

10:37.571 --> 10:39.204
        -Oh, fuck, yeah.        

10:40.574 --> 10:42.040
              What?             

10:53.720 --> 10:56.021
            (sighing)           

10:58.792 --> 11:00.191
      -JEFF: Hey, babe?         
         -Oh, my God.           

11:00.193 --> 11:01.426
             -What?             

11:01.428 --> 11:02.961
  -It's my fucking husband.     
       -JEFF: Honey...          

11:02.963 --> 11:05.430
    -Hey, babe, whose car       
    is that out in front?       

11:05.432 --> 11:07.332
           -Shit.               
       -Where do I go?          

11:07.334 --> 11:09.034
      -Get your jacket.         
      You got to hide.          

11:09.036 --> 11:10.669
          -Where am I           
          going to go?          

11:11.838 --> 11:15.940
        -JEFF: Babe...          
     -Don't make a sound.       

11:18.111 --> 11:23.248
     -What's that, baby?        
  Why are you home so soon?     

11:23.250 --> 11:25.316
            (laughs)            

11:26.887 --> 11:29.354
     -What are you doing        
        in lingerie?            

11:34.394 --> 11:36.561
        -Do you like it?        

11:36.563 --> 11:37.962
        -Is that makeup?        

11:39.833 --> 11:42.333
    -It was supposed to be      
          a surprise.           

11:42.335 --> 11:45.370
   I was just trying it on      
   for when you got back.       

11:45.372 --> 11:47.672
     And now you ruined it.     

11:47.674 --> 11:50.008
    Why are you home already?   

11:50.811 --> 11:53.378
     -You think I'm stupid?     

11:56.550 --> 11:58.349
           Is that it?          

11:58.351 --> 12:02.687
           You think            
   I'm fucking stupid, huh?     

12:02.689 --> 12:04.389
        Do you think            
     I'm fucking stupid?        

12:05.392 --> 12:08.093
   -But her on the other hand,  

12:08.095 --> 12:10.495
   she has everything to lose.  

12:10.497 --> 12:11.830
     I mean, think about it.    

12:11.832 --> 12:13.865
       He kicks her out,        
      where does she go?        

12:13.867 --> 12:16.167
       He cuts her off,         
      how does she live?        

12:17.370 --> 12:19.304
        Maybe the kid           
   liked to stick his hand      

12:19.306 --> 12:21.239
     a little bit too far       
       in the cookie jar        

12:21.241 --> 12:24.743
so she decides to cut it off    
before her husband finds out.   

12:25.846 --> 12:28.146
    Maybe the kid shows up      
         all the time.          

12:28.148 --> 12:29.814
 She tries to let him down easy,

12:29.816 --> 12:31.816
    but the kid threatens       
     to tell her husband        

12:31.818 --> 12:34.886
        if she doesn't          
     keep on fucking him.       

12:34.888 --> 12:38.923
            Bam.                
 She cuts his fucking throat    

12:38.925 --> 12:41.292
      because she feels         
    it's her only option.       

12:41.294 --> 12:42.894
             -Okay.             

12:42.896 --> 12:44.662
      Well, what about          
      the two Mexicans?         

12:44.664 --> 12:47.866
        And the Mr. Luke?       

12:49.836 --> 12:53.738
        -Yeah. Hmm-uh.          
        Good question.          

12:53.740 --> 12:55.406
    -You do have a couple       
    of good points there.       

12:55.408 --> 12:57.208
             -Yeah.             

12:58.211 --> 13:00.145
             -Yeah.             

13:00.147 --> 13:01.246
            (laughs)            

13:01.248 --> 13:02.881
  You should see your face.     
         Oh, my God.            

13:02.883 --> 13:04.149
     I forgot my briefcase.     

13:04.151 --> 13:05.917
         -I'm sorry--           
             -Wow.              

13:05.919 --> 13:08.319
          -I'm sorry.           
          -Fuck you.            

13:08.321 --> 13:09.754
         -No, for real,         
   you ruined the surprise.     

13:09.756 --> 13:10.955
   -I'm just kidding around.    

13:10.957 --> 13:13.124
       Hey, I'm sorry.          
        it was funny.           

13:13.126 --> 13:15.293
  -You're hurting my feelings.  

13:21.701 --> 13:23.368
      -What's the problem?      

13:23.370 --> 13:27.772
   -Let's just say he's...      
 having some marital issues.    

13:27.774 --> 13:29.974
            -Oh, yeah?          

13:29.976 --> 13:31.509
     I know all about those.    

13:33.046 --> 13:37.415
        -Hey, whose car         
      is parked outside?        

13:38.418 --> 13:39.684
           -What car?           

13:39.686 --> 13:42.487
    -Parked right in front.     
 Right in front of the house.   

13:42.489 --> 13:43.688
    Do you know whose it is?    

13:43.690 --> 13:45.023
     -I wouldn't know, baby.    

13:45.025 --> 13:47.292
    I've been in my mirror      
         all morning.           

13:47.294 --> 13:49.928
   It's-- The only person,      
         possibly...            

13:52.132 --> 13:54.632
      No, no, I'm sorry.        
   It's the neighbor's car.     

13:54.634 --> 13:56.000
         I remember now.        

13:56.002 --> 13:57.235
  She-- She came to the door    
         this morning           

13:57.237 --> 13:59.370
     and she said that--        
         She could--            

13:59.372 --> 14:01.940
   She asked if she could       
just park it for a few hours.   

14:01.942 --> 14:04.943
    I don't remember why,       
   but I figured, why not?      

14:04.945 --> 14:06.344
        -Which neighbor?        

14:07.814 --> 14:09.414
    -Well, I don't know her.    

14:09.416 --> 14:11.516
        Just assuming           
     she's our neighbor.        

14:16.289 --> 14:19.624
       -Okay. Just...           
look, it's not a parking lot.   

14:19.626 --> 14:22.126
Just don't let people park in   
  front of our house, okay?     

14:24.331 --> 14:25.864
           -Yes, sir.           

14:32.205 --> 14:33.905
  -Why's the bed all messed up? 

14:36.843 --> 14:38.776
            (sighing)           

14:38.778 --> 14:44.282
   -When I was trying this on,  
maybe I got a little too excited

14:44.284 --> 14:47.752
  thinking about what I was     
   gonna do to you later.       

14:47.754 --> 14:49.220
             Sorry.             

14:58.465 --> 15:02.100
         -You're late.          
 -You know there was traffic.   

15:02.102 --> 15:03.835
      -Sounds like excuses.     

15:03.837 --> 15:07.338
         -No excuses.           
       You are so sexy.         

15:07.340 --> 15:08.606
            (sighing)           

15:12.646 --> 15:15.079
         -Now enough            
with the interrogation, okay.   

15:15.081 --> 15:16.648
    You're going to be late.    

15:19.986 --> 15:22.120
     -Maybe I should just       
       take the day off.        

15:22.122 --> 15:25.023
  Just you and me, hang out,    
    spend the day together.     

15:26.226 --> 15:27.392
              -No.              

15:27.394 --> 15:31.029
     Babe, in the middle        
     of your huge deal?         

15:31.031 --> 15:34.065
 This is really important to us.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.235
You're not going to mess it up  
       for this, right?         

15:37.237 --> 15:39.137
  -Yeah, I guess you're right.  

15:40.607 --> 15:42.373
           -Okay.               
   -I'll be here, waiting.      

15:42.375 --> 15:44.676
          -Okay, okay.          
          (chuckling)           

15:57.824 --> 15:59.490
   -Have a good day, sweetie.   

15:59.492 --> 16:01.025
           -I'll try.           

16:02.495 --> 16:04.329
  GREGG (on phone): My rates    
   have gone up a little bit    

16:04.331 --> 16:06.130
     since the last time        
      I worked for you.         

16:06.132 --> 16:07.865
    I get $2000 in a day now    

16:07.867 --> 16:09.467
      because I picked up       
         an associate,          

16:09.469 --> 16:11.869
        and you'll have         
     to cover my expenses.      

16:11.871 --> 16:13.805
        And I'll need           
     a $10,000 retainer.        

16:13.807 --> 16:15.340
  -That's not a problem, okay.  

16:15.342 --> 16:16.941
  I'm just going to need you    
     for a couple of days.      

16:16.943 --> 16:18.509
             -Okay.             
When would you like me to start?

16:18.511 --> 16:21.245
   I may need you to start      
          tomorrow.             

16:21.247 --> 16:23.348
 GREGG (on phone): All right.   
      I'll tell you what,       

16:23.350 --> 16:25.516
    I'll send my associate,     
 Tim by your place in about--   

16:25.518 --> 16:27.352
   -Just have him call me,      
         all right?             

16:27.354 --> 16:30.288
 When you come to my house,     
 we'll set it up from there.    

16:30.290 --> 16:32.523
           -Will do.            
   Thank you, Mr. Schaefer.     

16:32.525 --> 16:34.125
            -Thanks.            

16:39.966 --> 16:42.066
        (birds chirping)        

16:46.873 --> 16:48.573
            (sighing)           

16:54.247 --> 16:55.713
         -(sighing)             
       -What the fuck?          

16:55.715 --> 16:57.949
   -I thought we were dead.     
    -What's wrong with you?     

16:57.951 --> 16:59.250
 -Your fucking husband was here.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.285
       -Whoa, whoa, whoa,       
      where are you going?      

17:01.287 --> 17:03.087
       -He saw my car,          
  you don't think he knows?     

17:03.089 --> 17:04.789
       -Are you insane?         
     You can't leave now.       

17:04.790 --> 17:06.057
         He'll see you.         

17:06.059 --> 17:07.290
            -Listen,            
 I got to get out of here, okay.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.659
          -I just--             
            -No.                

17:08.661 --> 17:11.396
  He's suspicious of everything.
             Relax.             

17:11.397 --> 17:12.964
        -Well, listen,          
      I just want to go.        

17:12.965 --> 17:14.632
      I just want to go.        
         -Whoa, whoa.           

17:14.634 --> 17:17.001
      What the fuck. Relax.     

17:17.002 --> 17:18.469
        Okay? Chill out.        

17:20.040 --> 17:23.307
    Yo, did you come here       
         to fuck me?            

17:24.676 --> 17:27.512
        Chill out, relax.       

17:29.582 --> 17:32.417
      Did you come here         
     to fuck me, or not?        

17:35.555 --> 17:37.188
              Yes?              

17:38.091 --> 17:41.826
           -Or no?              
           -Yeah.               

17:44.230 --> 17:46.264
        -So then fuck me.       

17:48.968 --> 17:50.301
         -Do you know           
     if your dad and Kim,       

17:50.303 --> 17:52.303
      did they fight a lot?     

17:52.305 --> 17:54.472
      -No, I don't think        
  I've ever seen them fight.    

17:54.474 --> 17:56.474
 I mean, we all get along well. 

17:56.476 --> 17:58.509
    She's a very nice person.   

17:59.512 --> 18:01.145
           -Of course.          

18:02.015 --> 18:03.514
        (car lock beeps)        

18:12.092 --> 18:14.392
         (engine starts)        

18:17.530 --> 18:19.630
 -Did you ever suspect your wife

18:19.632 --> 18:22.333
      might have a thing        
       with Mr. Singer?         

18:22.335 --> 18:24.502
     -We have a great life.     

18:24.504 --> 18:27.738
  I mean, this must've been     
   just some random thing.      

18:27.740 --> 18:30.541
       I mean, we argue,        
  you know, like any couple.    

18:30.543 --> 18:33.845
   But I'm just as shocked      
          as you are.           

18:43.990 --> 18:45.623
         -Mr. Schaefer?         

18:54.033 --> 18:56.067
            -10,000.            

18:56.069 --> 18:57.902
          As requested.         

19:00.340 --> 19:02.240
    -Gregg will be in touch.    

19:47.020 --> 19:48.419
         (camera clicks)        

19:56.196 --> 19:57.595
         (engine starts)        

20:01.968 --> 20:03.367
         (camera clicks)        

20:09.442 --> 20:11.042
      -Do you guys think        
 she's got anything to hide?    

20:11.044 --> 20:12.476
             (sighs)            

20:12.478 --> 20:14.212
        -I don't know.          
     I mean, she's young,       

20:14.214 --> 20:15.846
      you know what I mean?     

20:15.848 --> 20:18.583
 It's like, I think this guy    
  is a little bit paranoid.     

20:18.585 --> 20:20.051
         The last job           
        I had for him,          

20:20.053 --> 20:23.020
 I sat around for three weeks   
      waiting for a lead.       

20:23.022 --> 20:24.222
           -Hmm-mm.             
            -Yeah.              

20:24.224 --> 20:25.423
   I just think he's insecure.  

20:25.425 --> 20:26.857
  -(scoffs) Hell, yeah, he is.  

20:26.859 --> 20:28.025
         I would be too         

20:28.027 --> 20:29.894
 if I had a woman that young    
       and that fine.           

20:29.896 --> 20:31.862
           (all laugh)          

20:31.864 --> 20:33.598
 -Guys, do you think I should   
    get up on the hill there    

20:33.600 --> 20:35.633
     and take some photos       
      through the window?       

20:35.635 --> 20:37.134
            -Sure.              
            -Yeah.              

20:37.136 --> 20:39.503
 Be careful your cover doesn't  
  get blown on the first day.   

20:39.505 --> 20:41.072
           -Yeah.               
         -Hey, yeah.            

20:41.074 --> 20:43.608
And if she sees you, just say   
  you're with Google Maps.      

20:43.610 --> 20:46.143
       -That shit works?        
   -I get people every time.    

20:46.145 --> 20:48.646
-I'll give you guys a text when 
 I get to a good vantage point. 

20:48.648 --> 20:50.314
   -Ah, yeah. And watch out     
      for the gardeners.        

20:50.316 --> 20:52.183
   -Don't let them see you.     
          -Oh, yeah.            

20:52.185 --> 20:53.584
            Stealth.            

20:56.189 --> 20:57.388
   -Google Maps. I like that.   

20:57.390 --> 20:59.724
  -(chuckles) Works every time. 

21:06.699 --> 21:10.301
          (gate creaks)         

21:10.303 --> 21:11.535

   -Hey, hey, that's the car.

   really good burger place

      down the street,          
if you want to go get a bite?

        -Sorry, I can't.        

22:42.695 --> 22:44.261
         I just have            
a really busy day ahead of me,  

22:44.263 --> 22:46.397
 and I need to sleep some more. 

22:49.035 --> 22:50.368
     I'll see you tomorrow?     

22:50.370 --> 22:52.136
          -Yeah, yeah.          

22:53.406 --> 22:54.605
             -Good.             

22:54.607 --> 22:57.942
     -Ah, get some sleep.       
           -Hmm-mm.

             -Hello.            

23:20.500 --> 23:21.932
     -Hey, Luke, it's Jeff.     

23:21.934 --> 23:23.367
        -Hey, what's up?        

23:23.369 --> 23:25.569
   -I'm gonna need a favor      
          from you.             

23:25.571 --> 23:26.971
  -Of course, what do you need? 

23:26.973 --> 23:30.374
      -Remember that guy        
  you used to tell me about?    

23:30.376 --> 23:31.742
         -Aah. What guy?        

23:31.744 --> 23:34.779
   -The problem-solver guy.     
      I need his number.        

24:05.144 --> 24:06.577
        -The sky is blue.       

24:12.752 --> 24:14.552
    -But the clouds are gray.   

24:18.991 --> 24:23.561
     -Look, I don't know        
     what Luke told you.        

24:23.563 --> 24:25.563
      But this involves         
   the thing with my wife.      

24:30.536 --> 24:32.770
           -Oh, yeah?           

24:32.772 --> 24:36.240
         What thing             
    are we talking about?       

24:39.445 --> 24:40.978
    -I need her to disappear.   

24:42.582 --> 24:45.082
   I think you know what I'm    
 talking about, like, forever.  

24:49.522 --> 24:52.556
           -Okay.               
          I got it.             

24:53.593 --> 24:55.493
    You got something for me?   

25:00.433 --> 25:02.766
          -That's 40K.          

25:02.768 --> 25:04.802
     Get the other half         
    when the job is done.       

25:09.442 --> 25:10.841
             -Okay.             

25:12.445 --> 25:16.547
       -The back door           
      will be unlocked;         

25:16.549 --> 25:19.216
      the security codes        
     are in the envelope.       

25:20.353 --> 25:21.752
           -Very good.          

25:22.889 --> 25:27.291
            -Listen.            
 This is really important to me.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.628
  I'm leaving tomorrow morning. 

25:30.630 --> 25:32.663
       I need this job          
by tomorrow night, all right?   

25:37.470 --> 25:38.869
     -That's not a problem.     

25:41.307 --> 25:42.740
        -One more thing.        

25:45.511 --> 25:46.944
       (car door unlocks)       

25:51.417 --> 25:52.917
             -Hi.               
             -Hi.               

25:52.919 --> 25:55.553
Hey, little girl, little girl.  
            Hello.              

25:55.555 --> 25:58.355
          -Why are you          
  taking photos of my house?    

25:58.357 --> 26:01.191
     -Oh. That's your house?    

26:01.193 --> 26:03.594
            -Yeah.              
  Well, it's my Dad's house.    

26:03.596 --> 26:07.665
  -Well, I'm a photographer     
   and I'm shooting birds.      

26:07.667 --> 26:09.400
            -Yeah.              
            -Yeah.              

26:09.402 --> 26:10.935
   -And I'm a weather monitor   

26:10.937 --> 26:13.971
and we are testing our thesis   
    on birds flying north       

26:13.973 --> 26:15.806
      and your property         
     just happened to be        

26:15.808 --> 26:17.408
   right under the bird path.   

26:17.410 --> 26:19.109
    -Wow, that's really cool.   

26:19.111 --> 26:21.278
          -Yeah, yeah.          

26:21.280 --> 26:24.248
        Yeah, so... okay.       

26:24.250 --> 26:26.650
    -This is our partner.       
    This is-- Hey, Brad.        

26:26.652 --> 26:29.053
  Did you get some pictures     
    of those black birds?       

26:29.055 --> 26:30.721
          -Uh...yeah.           

26:30.723 --> 26:32.890
        Yeah, I did.            
     I love black birds.        

26:32.892 --> 26:34.725
       -Yeah, and you are?      

26:34.727 --> 26:36.560
    -Oh, my name's Brooke.      
      That's my house.          

26:36.562 --> 26:37.962
   I actually go to school      
       up the street.           

26:37.964 --> 26:39.597
 -Really. What grade are you in?

26:39.599 --> 26:41.465
        -Eighth grade?          
         -(gasps) Wow.          

26:41.467 --> 26:43.133
          -Yeah, okay.          

26:43.135 --> 26:45.269
   I hope you don't mind I was  
taking some photos of the house.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.271
       -Is that okay?           
      -No, that's fine.         

26:47.273 --> 26:49.006
    You guys can come back      
       anytime you want.        

26:49.008 --> 26:50.407
       -Oh, thank you.          
     -Thank you, Brooke.        

26:50.409 --> 26:51.609
            -Bye.               
       -See you later.          

26:51.611 --> 26:52.977
         -Thanks, bye.          
           -Oh, boy.            

26:52.979 --> 26:55.012
    -What the fuck was that?    
    -She just snuck up on us.   

26:55.014 --> 26:56.947
       -(sighs) Jesus.          
       -It's all good.          

26:56.949 --> 26:59.350
 -Yeah, check this out, man,    
         I got gold.            

26:59.352 --> 27:01.719
-Oh, that's better than gold,   
      that's platinum.          

27:01.721 --> 27:04.755
   -Pay day. Call your guy.     
            -Right.             

27:07.259 --> 27:08.459
      -It's a nice nightie.     

27:08.461 --> 27:11.595
   -Mr. Schaefer. Yes, sir.     
       Yeah, it's me.           

27:11.597 --> 27:13.330
   Ah, we got some information  

27:13.332 --> 27:16.467
       I think you'd be         
  very interested in seeing.    

27:16.469 --> 27:18.035
             Hmm-mm.            

27:18.037 --> 27:20.270
       Yeah, I'll send          
    my associate, Tim, by       

27:20.272 --> 27:23.507
      later on tonight          
      with an envelope.         

27:23.509 --> 27:26.777
           Yes, sir.            
        No, thank you.          

27:26.779 --> 27:29.146
         Bye. All right.        

27:29.148 --> 27:31.382
    -Maybe you can help us      
        just track this         

27:31.384 --> 27:33.917
     all the way through        
     from the beginning.        

27:33.919 --> 27:35.285
     -Did your boyfriend        
      have any enemies?         

27:35.287 --> 27:37.821
          -He's not--           
    He's not my boyfriend.      

27:37.823 --> 27:39.289
          -Your lover?          

28:05.017 --> 28:07.785
  -That little fucking whore... 

28:07.787 --> 28:10.721
        -I'm sorry, man.        

28:10.723 --> 28:13.991
        It is what it is.       

28:13.993 --> 28:16.060
          -Thank you.           
         -You got it.           

28:32.845 --> 28:34.445
    -Cut her fucking throat.    

28:47.493 --> 28:48.892
             -Okay.             

28:59.004 --> 29:00.904
        -Look, guys.            
I-- I don't know what to say.   

29:00.906 --> 29:04.575
    I don't know this person.   

29:04.577 --> 29:08.779
      -So you're saying         
     Luke doesn't exist.        

29:08.781 --> 29:10.647
-No, that's not what I'm saying.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.082
       What I'm saying is,      

29:12.084 --> 29:14.451
      I have never worked       
  or known a guy named Luke.    

29:14.453 --> 29:16.787
I don't know how much clearer   
       I can make it.           

29:46.619 --> 29:49.119
       (car engine starts)      

29:57.997 --> 29:59.396
       -Is that your guy?       

30:03.402 --> 30:06.069
             -Yeah.             

30:06.071 --> 30:08.071
      -So you're ready          
     to do this or what?        

30:08.073 --> 30:10.407
     Clock's ticking, homey.    

30:12.645 --> 30:15.612
     -Okay, yeah. Let's go.     

30:15.614 --> 30:18.115
      Hey, there, homey.        
  Get in the driver's seat.     

30:51.750 --> 30:55.085
 -So like I think that maybe... 
   when I was talking to her,   

30:55.087 --> 30:57.221
        she said like,          
  the place was on the left.    

30:57.223 --> 30:59.289
      All right, look.          
 Man, she was kind of vague.    

30:59.291 --> 31:01.291
       She was drinking,        
      she was fucked up.        

31:01.293 --> 31:03.727
    I don't know, if I'm...     
  in the wrong neighborhood.    

31:03.729 --> 31:06.196
            (laughs)            

31:06.198 --> 31:08.532
       But it's okay.           
       We'll find her.          

31:11.737 --> 31:14.972
            (humming)           

31:16.842 --> 31:19.209
   -Is everything all right?    
I thought you guys were happy.  

31:19.211 --> 31:20.844
      -I'm gonna tell you       
    what fucking happened.      

31:20.846 --> 31:22.646
    She's fucking some kid      
         in my house.           

31:22.648 --> 31:25.816
     And I'm not paying         
   for no fucking divorce.      

31:25.818 --> 31:27.751
             -Fuck.             

31:27.753 --> 31:30.387
        All right, uh...        

31:30.389 --> 31:32.256
       Let me reach out.        
  I'll give you a call back.    

31:32.258 --> 31:34.024
            -Thanks.            

31:40.432 --> 31:43.000
       (cell phone rings)       

31:43.002 --> 31:46.870
           (whistling)          

31:46.872 --> 31:49.006
       (cell phone rings)       

31:49.008 --> 31:50.807
           -Hello.              
        -LUKE: Eddie.           

31:50.809 --> 31:52.342
             -Yeah?             

31:52.344 --> 31:54.111
         LUKE: I think          
   I got something for you.     

31:54.113 --> 31:56.446
         -Oh, yeah?             
   What type of something?      

31:56.448 --> 31:59.082
      -Ah, it's better          
    if we talk in person.       

31:59.084 --> 32:03.020
      -Hmm-mm. Okay, when?      

32:03.022 --> 32:05.422
-I can come to you right now,   
       if that's okay?          

32:05.424 --> 32:07.958
           -Sure.               
Do you remember where I live?   

32:07.960 --> 32:09.893
           -Yeah.               
 Yeah, I'll see you shortly.    

32:09.895 --> 32:12.029
         -Yes, you will.        

32:15.167 --> 32:18.235
       -Eddie Green...          
       -Mr. Driffites.          

32:18.237 --> 32:20.370
     -Hey, nice to see you.     

32:20.372 --> 32:22.739
  -Good to see you, my friend.  
          Come on in.           

32:22.741 --> 32:25.509
         Close the gate.        

32:25.511 --> 32:27.077
            Come on.            

32:31.784 --> 32:33.183
              -Hey.             

32:36.288 --> 32:38.322
We almost got fucked back there.
      You know that, right?     

32:38.324 --> 32:40.457
        -Yeah, I know.          
 I thought you called it off.   

32:40.459 --> 32:41.692
             -I did.            

32:41.694 --> 32:44.194
     He must have already       
killed the kid when I saw him.  

32:46.165 --> 32:48.532
 -What do you propose we do now?

32:48.534 --> 32:50.067
         -All right,            
  well, first things first,     

32:50.069 --> 32:52.769
     we need to settle up       
     your debt with Jose.       

32:52.771 --> 32:54.171
         -What? No way.         

32:54.173 --> 32:55.372
      I didn't tell him         
      to kill that kid.         

32:55.374 --> 32:56.773
  I'm not paying for that shit. 

32:56.775 --> 32:58.308
      -It's not about that.     

32:58.310 --> 32:59.910
      If you don't pay,         
he's going to come after you.   

32:59.912 --> 33:01.578
      Trust me. Just...         
      just chalk it up          

33:01.580 --> 33:04.848
   to a business expense,       
   and we'll move forward.      

33:04.850 --> 33:07.317
         -Motherfucker.         

33:07.319 --> 33:09.586
        All right, just--       
  Just call that Edward guy.    

33:09.588 --> 33:10.988
    We'll meet him tomorrow,    
           all right?           

33:10.990 --> 33:12.389
      -We have to go today.     

33:12.391 --> 33:13.690
           -Why today?          

33:13.692 --> 33:16.793
      -Because we need him      
out of town as soon as possible.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.029
    The cops have witnesses     
  putting him at the murder.    

33:19.031 --> 33:20.530
 They find him, we're fucked.   
             Okay?              

33:20.532 --> 33:22.399
             -Okay.             

33:22.401 --> 33:24.568
          -All right.           
  I already set up the meet.    

33:24.570 --> 33:26.436
     We'll take your car.       
       Here, I'll drive.        

33:26.438 --> 33:28.338
           -Come on.            
       -What, like now?         

33:30.976 --> 33:32.209
         -What part of          
     "as soon as possible"      

33:32.211 --> 33:34.411
     do you not understand?     

33:34.413 --> 33:36.146
            Come on.            

33:39.551 --> 33:40.784
            -Perfect.           

33:40.786 --> 33:42.219
            Come on.            

33:53.298 --> 33:56.233
   (water running and humming)  

34:25.364 --> 34:27.097
      -So, what you think?      

34:27.099 --> 34:29.498
          -About what?          

34:29.501 --> 34:32.235
    -About that guy, man,       
 who parked over there, huh?    

34:32.237 --> 34:36.273
    -He must be the reason      
      he wants him dead.        

34:36.275 --> 34:38.275
     -Trifling-ass bitch,       
      if you ask me, man.       

34:38.277 --> 34:39.708
             -Hmm.              
        -So, what's up?         

34:39.710 --> 34:41.110
    What you want to do now?    

34:45.684 --> 34:47.184
    -We're gonna do the job.    

34:47.186 --> 34:48.652
         -Wait up, man.         

34:48.654 --> 34:50.219
         I don't think          
    that's too smart, man.      

34:50.222 --> 34:51.655
     There's two of them        
      up in there now.          

34:51.657 --> 34:53.190
    That changes everything.    

34:53.192 --> 34:54.858
        -No, it doesn't.        

34:54.860 --> 34:58.161
    It's just two bodies.       
       It's simple now.         

34:58.163 --> 35:00.664
            Let's go.           

35:03.135 --> 35:05.702
             Coming?            

35:39.872 --> 35:42.405
  -I thought he caught a life   
 sentence from the Detroit job. 

35:42.407 --> 35:43.707
            -He did.            

35:43.709 --> 35:45.942
 But he got out in five years   
     because he finished        

35:45.944 --> 35:48.712
   this five-year bullshit      
   rehabilitation program.      

35:48.714 --> 35:51.515
      He just had to say,       
"I'm Jose, I'm innocent, man."  

35:51.517 --> 35:53.116
          Five years,           
and they let him go. They did.  

35:53.118 --> 35:55.452
         (Eddie laughs)         

35:55.454 --> 35:57.654
      -What a fucked-up         
     system we got, huh?        

35:57.656 --> 35:58.855
           -You think?          

35:58.857 --> 36:00.090
  -The guy kills four people... 

36:00.092 --> 36:01.591
        -Five people.           
           -Five?               

36:01.593 --> 36:03.360
             -Yeah.             

36:03.362 --> 36:05.228
      -...in cold blood,        
    and ten years later...      

36:05.230 --> 36:07.631
         -Five years.           
           -(laughs)            

36:07.633 --> 36:13.003
        Five years later,       
 he's out on the fucking street.

36:13.005 --> 36:16.773
   But a black kid at the park  

36:16.775 --> 36:20.877
     gets a life sentence       
   for slinging a dime bag.     

36:23.348 --> 36:25.582
        Pretty fucked up.       

36:25.584 --> 36:27.651
     -Well, he's black.         
        You said it.            

36:27.653 --> 36:29.686
     But it's the truth.        
       It's fucked up.          

36:29.688 --> 36:30.754
             -Yeah.             

36:30.756 --> 36:34.291
          All right.            
   How do you wanna run it?     

36:34.293 --> 36:36.126
           -Okay,               
so connect me with your guy,    

36:36.128 --> 36:37.594
     I'll go collect my fee     

36:37.596 --> 36:38.962
       and I'll tell him        
  how to get a hold of Jose.    

36:38.964 --> 36:42.399
   We'll start there. Okay?     
          Sound good?           

36:42.401 --> 36:44.901
        -Sounds good.           
        Let's do it.            

36:44.903 --> 36:46.336
  -I'll show you out, Luke,     
          come on.              

36:46.338 --> 36:47.571
      -Thank you, Eddie.        
            -Sure.              

36:47.573 --> 36:50.140
  -Always a pleasure. Let's go. 

36:50.142 --> 36:52.275
    -Pharmaceuticals, huh?      
            -Yeah.              

36:52.277 --> 36:54.477
     -He's a killer too.        
          -(laughs)             

37:04.523 --> 37:08.458
      -What's wrong, baby?      

37:08.460 --> 37:11.361
        You can't sleep?        

37:11.363 --> 37:14.297
      -It's just work--         
         Just work.             

37:14.299 --> 37:15.732
         -Stressed out?         

37:20.372 --> 37:24.474
 That's what I'm here for, baby.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.210
    Let's make it all better.   

37:27.212 --> 37:29.746
   -Look, I said, not tonight.  

37:29.748 --> 37:31.615
       Not tonight, okay?       

37:48.300 --> 37:49.866
          -No, it's--           
         It's not that.         

37:49.868 --> 37:55.238
    It's just that I'm...       
fucking bored with this life.   

37:55.240 --> 37:56.640
            (laughs)            

37:56.642 --> 38:00.510
      Well, maybe I will.       
         Maybe I will.          

38:00.512 --> 38:03.480
      Get a weekend off         
  and we can hit the Strip.     

38:03.482 --> 38:05.415
         Like old times.        

38:09.621 --> 38:11.454
     You know, sometimes,       
         I don't know           

38:11.456 --> 38:14.190
       how this old fuck        
  can still get his dick up.    

38:14.192 --> 38:17.227
            (giggles)           

38:17.229 --> 38:19.963
         I have a--             
   I have to deal with it.      

38:19.965 --> 38:22.132
He would, like the first time   
      he ever told me,          

38:22.134 --> 38:23.967
    "Oh, I'm-- I'm so hard,"    

38:23.969 --> 38:27.837
 I was like, "Oh, wow, I thought
     you weren't ready yet."    

38:27.839 --> 38:30.206
            (giggles)           

38:30.208 --> 38:32.242
        No, it's like--         
        It's really bad.        

38:32.244 --> 38:33.843
        I kind of just--        

38:33.845 --> 38:38.715
  This is where my theater      
 background comes into play.    

38:59.805 --> 39:01.705
             -Hi.               
             -Hi.               

39:01.707 --> 39:03.540
       I'm-- I'm sorry.         
     Is your father here?       

39:03.542 --> 39:05.442
    -Oh, yeah. He's upstairs.   

39:05.444 --> 39:07.143
           -Okay.               
        -Who are you?           

39:07.145 --> 39:08.645
    -Oh, I'm a friend of his.   

39:08.647 --> 39:11.147
      He's expecting me.        
     If you don't mind...       

39:11.149 --> 39:13.149
           -Okay.               
       -Thanks, honey.          

39:13.151 --> 39:14.718
             -Daddy.            

39:14.720 --> 39:16.353
      He should be down         
      in just a minute.         

39:16.355 --> 39:18.788
           -Great.              
    So, what's your name?       

39:18.790 --> 39:20.123
            -Brooke.            

39:21.293 --> 39:22.992
             -Hey.              
        -Hey, sweetie.          

39:22.994 --> 39:24.961
   Um... I just have to talk    
to my friend for a little bit.  

39:24.963 --> 39:26.329
     Little business, okay?     

39:26.331 --> 39:27.530
    -Okay. Nice meeting you.    

39:27.532 --> 39:29.399
        -Okay. Let's go.        

39:29.401 --> 39:30.800
             -Yeah.             

39:30.802 --> 39:32.335
            -Come on.           

39:32.337 --> 39:34.337
     -Why come to the door?     
 I thought you were gonna call. 

39:34.339 --> 39:35.672
            -I did.             
     There was no answer.       

39:35.674 --> 39:37.440
           -Oh, I---            
       -Hey, all right.         

39:37.442 --> 39:39.342
     Jeff, it's all good.       
        It's all good.          

39:39.344 --> 39:42.946
          Look, relax.          

39:42.948 --> 39:45.248
        You do realize...       

39:45.250 --> 39:47.584
 what you're getting yourself   
         into, right?           

39:50.188 --> 39:53.490
 You need to know that your life
     will never be the same.    

39:53.492 --> 39:55.658
          Listen to me.         

39:55.660 --> 39:59.929
   There's no turning back      
  from something like this.     

39:59.931 --> 40:02.532
        So are you sure?        

40:02.534 --> 40:04.567
   Maybe you wanna-- You know,  

40:04.569 --> 40:06.436
  sleep on it for a night...    
         I don't know.          

40:06.438 --> 40:07.670
        What do you say?        

40:07.672 --> 40:10.440
    -Well, I haven't slept      
        for days, man.          

40:10.442 --> 40:12.308
             -Why?              
           -Just...             

40:12.310 --> 40:13.810
           -It's okay.          

40:21.520 --> 40:22.986
        Do you hate her?        

40:27.225 --> 40:28.625
     Do you really hate her?    

40:31.830 --> 40:33.129
              Okay.             

40:38.870 --> 40:40.870
    -Put these coordinates      
       into your GPS.           

40:40.872 --> 40:43.206
      Pull your car over.       
 Roll the window down and wait. 

40:43.208 --> 40:45.041
 A guy's gonna approach your car
     and then he'll get in.     

40:45.043 --> 40:47.143
 I need you to say the phrase   
    on that piece of paper,     

40:47.145 --> 40:50.246
wait for his response to confirm
 he's the right guy to talk to. 

40:50.248 --> 40:52.115
After that, I don't give a fuck 
      what you talk about.      

40:52.117 --> 40:53.416
          -I got it.            
          -Oh, yeah.            

40:53.418 --> 40:56.519
       Um, and I mean           
   every word I say, okay?      

40:56.521 --> 40:58.621
     No sudden moves, or...     

40:58.623 --> 41:00.723
   You know, with this guy,     
you might get yourself killed.  

41:00.725 --> 41:03.293
  So if you have to sneeze,     
     you know, hold it.         

41:03.295 --> 41:05.128
        And I mean that.        

41:05.130 --> 41:07.630
   That's where you are now.    
 You're sure you wanna be here? 

41:09.968 --> 41:12.635
       It's been all fun        
   and fucking games, Jeff.     

41:12.637 --> 41:14.704
        Until right now.        

41:15.941 --> 41:20.176
          Because this,         
this is not a fucking game, man.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.611
             At all.            

41:22.481 --> 41:23.880
     Do you understand that?    

41:28.186 --> 41:29.719
              Good.             

41:31.256 --> 41:33.223
          -Thank you.           
          -All right.           

41:33.225 --> 41:34.624
        I'll be in touch.       

41:45.704 --> 41:47.237
     TERRY (over phone):        
     Yes, Mr. Schaefer.         

41:47.239 --> 41:48.705
          -Hey, Terry.          

41:48.707 --> 41:50.840
       I'm gonna have to        
     fly out to Vancouver       

41:50.842 --> 41:52.876
        to help James           
  on that acquisition deal.     

41:52.878 --> 41:54.644
 I just need to go out tomorrow 

41:54.646 --> 41:57.680
      for a quick flight,       
   coming back the same day.    

41:57.682 --> 41:59.115
     TERRY (over phone):        
         No problem.            

42:08.627 --> 42:10.727
   (Kim screaming and moaning)  

42:34.653 --> 42:37.854
         (both moaning)         

42:47.365 --> 42:50.066
         (Kim screaming)        

42:54.472 --> 42:56.639
        (doorbell rings)        

42:56.641 --> 42:58.141
          -Stop, stop.          

43:01.079 --> 43:02.845
     -(doorbell ringing)        
        -What is that?          

43:05.216 --> 43:06.416
         Just a minute.         

43:06.418 --> 43:07.917
              Jeez.             

43:30.675 --> 43:33.776
   (suspenseful theme playing)  

43:53.898 --> 43:56.432
 -Did you have to kill the kid? 
      I told you to leave.      

43:56.434 --> 44:00.236
      -Hey, listen, man.        
 I got hired to do a job, no?   

44:00.238 --> 44:03.306
It's not my fault. You called it
    off at the last minute.     

44:03.308 --> 44:05.975
 -Too late. They have a witness 
   putting you at the house.    

44:05.977 --> 44:07.510
 The cops are looking for you   
         as we speak.           

44:07.512 --> 44:08.745
  You need to get out of town.  

44:08.747 --> 44:11.748
            -What?              
    I ain't going nowhere.      

44:11.750 --> 44:13.750
  -So you'd rather go to jail.  

44:13.752 --> 44:15.351
   -No, I'm not going to jail.  

44:15.353 --> 44:16.686
       He's going to jail.      

44:16.688 --> 44:18.121
       -Hm-hm, why's that?      

44:18.123 --> 44:20.123
-Hey, just everybody slow down  
      for a minute, okay.       

44:20.125 --> 44:21.691
       Look, I'm sorry          
   I called this thing off      

44:21.693 --> 44:23.092
     at the last minute.        
           Just...              

44:23.094 --> 44:25.828
  look, just take the money     
    and leave town, okay?       

44:27.565 --> 44:29.899
      Just take it, and go.     

44:34.906 --> 44:36.539
            -Yeah,              
   it was just kind of a...     

44:36.541 --> 44:38.107
    last-minute sort of trip.   

44:38.109 --> 44:40.176
 I'm sorry, what did you say    
    your name was again?        

44:40.178 --> 44:41.544
             -Luke.             

44:41.546 --> 44:44.414
 -Luke, okay, well, I'm sure    
    if it's an emergency,       

44:44.416 --> 44:46.916
      you could probably        
  just fax in the documents.    

44:46.918 --> 44:48.818
  -Yeah, you're probably right. 

44:52.023 --> 44:54.991
     You think I can come in    
and use the bathroom real quick?

44:54.993 --> 44:57.126
           Kind of--            
  Kind of really have to go.    

45:00.699 --> 45:02.165
 -I don't mean to be rude, Luke,

45:02.167 --> 45:04.067
  but I just don't know you     
         like that.             

45:04.069 --> 45:06.569
    There's a gas station       
       up the street.           

45:06.571 --> 45:08.037
    -Okay, yeah, no worries.    

45:11.609 --> 45:13.142
   -I'll get these to Jeff.     
            -Um-hm.             

45:16.181 --> 45:17.847
 -Yeah, no. Nice to meet you.   
     -Sorry to interrupt.       

45:17.849 --> 45:19.082
      -Yeah, all right.         
        -Yeah, sorry.           

45:19.084 --> 45:20.917
    -Sorry to interrupt--       
        -No worries.            

45:20.919 --> 45:22.318
      -Have a good one.         
         -All right.            

45:26.658 --> 45:29.258
   (suspenseful theme playing)  

47:08.860 --> 47:10.059
       -We do realize           
     you've been through        

47:10.061 --> 47:12.028
    something very traumatic.   

47:13.131 --> 47:14.564
       And we believe you.      

47:16.067 --> 47:20.369
     Unfortunately, we are      
required to ask you questions,  

47:20.371 --> 47:25.208
    that although may seem      
      stupid or annoying,       

47:25.210 --> 47:27.443
       they do help us          
    in our investigation.       

47:31.382 --> 47:34.550
  -So is this the first time    
 you cheated on your husband?   

47:38.823 --> 47:40.590
   -I think I want my lawyer.   

47:43.695 --> 47:45.828
             -Okay.             

47:45.830 --> 47:49.298
You do have a right to counsel. 
 But, um, just to let you know, 

47:49.300 --> 47:50.967
     we're not trying to        
 implicate you for anything.    

47:50.969 --> 47:52.435
          We're just--          

47:52.437 --> 47:56.339
   We just want to get some     
      foundational facts.       

47:56.341 --> 47:58.207
      -And you can leave        
      whenever you want.        

47:58.209 --> 48:03.913
  We just... the deceased...    
         Cory Singer,           

48:03.915 --> 48:05.982
    he-- He has a voice too,    

48:05.984 --> 48:08.451
      and we want to help       
      his voice be heard.       

48:08.453 --> 48:10.720
      We want to help you       
   find who did this to him.    

48:10.722 --> 48:13.656
       -We need to know         
        what you know.          

48:15.994 --> 48:17.426
           That's all.          

48:17.428 --> 48:18.895
         -I don't know.         

48:19.964 --> 48:22.265
       -Has Mr. Schaefer        
    ever seen Cory before?      

48:22.267 --> 48:23.900
              -No.              

48:23.902 --> 48:25.534
       -Does he know--          
       -He has no idea.         

48:25.536 --> 48:27.503
       -He has no idea.         
   Are you sure about that?     

48:36.147 --> 48:37.947
      -What are you doing?      

48:42.987 --> 48:45.955
    You're a creep sometimes.   

48:46.824 --> 48:48.224
             Cory...            

48:50.328 --> 48:52.128
            (screams)           

48:55.600 --> 48:57.300
      -Damn, bro. I was         
  just gonna call you guys.     

48:57.302 --> 48:58.701
      There's this fool         
       walking around.          

48:58.703 --> 49:00.503
           -Drive.              
         Just drive.            

49:04.208 --> 49:07.376
     (sobbing and screaming)    

49:10.014 --> 49:12.181
        -No seriously,          
        I owe you one.          

49:12.183 --> 49:13.649
      LUKE: I'm just glad       
   I was able to get to him     

49:13.651 --> 49:15.184
    before anything happened.   

49:21.092 --> 49:22.391
          -So, Brooke,          
  we're only going to hold you  

49:22.393 --> 49:24.393
for a little while longer, okay?

49:24.395 --> 49:26.128
             -Okay.             

49:26.130 --> 49:27.763
   -But we would like to know,  

49:27.765 --> 49:30.399
why did you stay at your mom's  
       the night before?        

49:30.401 --> 49:33.536
 -I only spend three days a week
       at my dad's house.       

49:33.538 --> 49:36.305
 And that night happened to be  
the night I spent at my mom's.  

49:36.307 --> 49:37.773
       So I wasn't there.       

49:37.775 --> 49:41.344
    -How come you didn't        
write down the license plate?   

49:41.346 --> 49:44.046
     -It happened so fast.      
      I really don't know.      

49:44.048 --> 49:45.648
    -How many times a week      
      would you guys say        

49:45.650 --> 49:47.850
    you see that Mustang        
    in your neighborhood?       

49:47.852 --> 49:49.685
        -When did I say         
       I saw a Mustang?         

49:49.687 --> 49:52.555
  -Well, you must have thought  
 something was a little bit off.

49:52.557 --> 49:55.524
      You heard the screams     
 and then they run into the car.

49:55.526 --> 49:57.226
      -I saw them running,      

49:57.228 --> 50:00.363
then maybe five seconds later,  
      we heard a scream.        

50:00.365 --> 50:03.766
   -Do you know if your dad     
and Kim, did they fight a lot?  

50:03.768 --> 50:06.235
      -No, I don't think        
  I've ever seen them fight.    

50:06.237 --> 50:07.837
 I mean, we all get along well. 

50:07.839 --> 50:09.739
   -So all the other people     
    that live on the block,     

50:09.741 --> 50:11.574
 they're not getting questioned,
           but we are?          

50:11.576 --> 50:13.376
       -He's a great guy.       

50:13.378 --> 50:15.311
   I can't imagine anyone       
   who'd want to hurt him.      

50:15.313 --> 50:16.679
     -This don't make sense.    

50:16.681 --> 50:18.114
      You're treating us        
     like we did a crime,       

50:18.116 --> 50:19.348
      and we just walking       
        down the street.        

50:19.350 --> 50:20.850
       -We just wanna           
     kinda get an idea--        

50:20.852 --> 50:22.752
   -There was a murder, guys.   

50:22.754 --> 50:23.986
   Do you want to help or not?  

50:23.988 --> 50:25.521
        -We didn't have         
    nothing to do with it.      

50:25.523 --> 50:27.223
   -I know you didn't have      
   anything to do with it.      

50:27.225 --> 50:28.858
      We're trying to get       
  some information from you.    

50:28.860 --> 50:30.359
     -Then why are we here?     

50:30.361 --> 50:31.994
      -Because you live         
 in the guy's neighborhood--    

50:31.996 --> 50:33.496
         -No, no, no.           
      They're right, go.        

50:33.498 --> 50:35.364
 You don't have to be here, go. 

50:35.366 --> 50:37.400
       -Look. We're just        
   telling you what we saw.     

50:37.402 --> 50:39.068
 Sorry we didn't call the police

50:39.070 --> 50:41.537
because we saw some Mexican guys
 driving in a nice neighborhood.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.839
          I, for one,           
    am not a racist, okay.      

50:43.841 --> 50:46.242
       -We didn't make          
   that assumption at all.      

50:46.244 --> 50:48.411
     -Are you kidding me        
         right now?             

50:48.413 --> 50:50.880
       -What do you know        
     about Mrs. Schaefer?       

50:50.882 --> 50:53.015
     -I know he shouldn't       
       have married her.        

50:53.017 --> 50:54.216
      -Why do you say that?     

50:54.218 --> 50:55.718
         -It's obvious.         

50:55.720 --> 50:58.587
 I mean, she's only with him    
    because of the money.       

50:58.589 --> 51:00.256
           Come on,             
    let's be serious here.      

51:00.258 --> 51:02.191
       She's half his age.      

51:02.193 --> 51:03.626
  And they meet six months ago, 

51:03.628 --> 51:05.194
   and now they're married,     
       all of a sudden.         

51:05.196 --> 51:07.763
        I'm pretty sure         
       she's an escort.         

51:08.766 --> 51:12.068
         (phone ringing)        

51:12.070 --> 51:13.736
             -Hello?            

51:13.738 --> 51:15.571
            -Baby?              
             -Kim?              

51:15.573 --> 51:19.642
        KIM (sobbing):          
     Baby, I'm so scared,       

51:19.644 --> 51:21.110
           I need you.          

51:21.112 --> 51:22.945
     -Kim, what's going on?     
         Are you okay?          

51:22.947 --> 51:28.084
 -I need you to call your lawyer
 and come to the police station.

51:28.086 --> 51:30.086
   I'm at the one in Westlake.  

51:30.088 --> 51:31.353
      -What do you mean?        
        The police...?          

51:31.355 --> 51:32.621
      What are you doing        
    in the police station?      

51:32.623 --> 51:35.391
 -I can't really tell you now.  

51:35.393 --> 51:37.726
   But can you please just...   

51:37.728 --> 51:40.362
   I know there's a detective   
who's gonna call you any minute.

51:40.364 --> 51:41.864
   And I just want you to know  

51:41.866 --> 51:44.433
     that whatever he says,     
       I'm-- I'm innocent       

51:44.435 --> 51:46.502
 and I didn't do anything, okay.

51:46.504 --> 51:47.903
 I just need you to believe me. 

51:47.905 --> 51:49.605
     -What do you mean,         
a detective is gonna call me?   

51:49.607 --> 51:52.408
    What is going on, Kim?      
          Talk to me.           

51:52.410 --> 51:55.244
   -I'll explain everything     
      when you get here.        

51:55.246 --> 51:56.645
        -All right, okay.       

52:13.431 --> 52:15.164
       JEFF (on phone):         
             Baby?              

52:15.166 --> 52:17.733
        -Mr. Schaefer?          
         -Who's this?           

52:17.735 --> 52:21.203
          -My name is           
   Detective Timothy Jones.     

52:21.205 --> 52:22.638
      I'm contacting you        
       about an incident        

52:22.640 --> 52:24.773
       that took place          
     in your home today.        

52:24.775 --> 52:26.442
   -Listen, what is going on?   

52:26.444 --> 52:28.410
 -As I understand it, you're    
 out of town at the moment.     

52:28.412 --> 52:32.348
     Is... there any way        
    you could be in town?       

52:32.350 --> 52:35.084
     We urgently need to        
       speak with you.          

52:35.086 --> 52:37.219
          -I'll be on           
     the next flight out.       

52:37.221 --> 52:39.021
             -Great.            

52:39.023 --> 52:40.923
          -Listen,              
   can I speak to my wife?      

52:40.925 --> 52:43.159
       -Unfortunately,          
   we are in the middle of      

52:43.161 --> 52:46.662
an open investigation right now,
so you cannot speak with her.   

52:46.664 --> 52:50.900
  But as soon as you get here,  
sir, she'll be available to you.

52:50.902 --> 52:53.335
      -Okay, I'm on my way.     

52:53.337 --> 52:54.904
    -All right, see you soon.   

52:57.175 --> 52:58.941
        -LUKE: Hello?           
           -Luke?               

52:58.943 --> 53:01.243
    -LUKE: Hey, what's up?      
      -We got a problem.        

53:03.347 --> 53:05.781
        -Well, we have          
      witnesses that say        

53:05.783 --> 53:08.584
 they saw two Hispanic males    
  leaving the neighborhood      

53:08.586 --> 53:12.054
  in a rush after the screams.  

53:12.056 --> 53:13.289
      You got any enemies?      

53:13.291 --> 53:16.692
     (door open and closes)     

53:16.694 --> 53:19.728
         -Who are you?          
 -This interrogation is over.   

53:19.730 --> 53:22.198
 I told you not to interview    
my client without me present.   

53:22.200 --> 53:24.833
            Let's go.           

53:24.835 --> 53:26.435
       When you're ready        
    to charge Mr. Schaefer      

53:26.437 --> 53:29.071
    with an actual crime,       
  then you can talk to him.     

53:29.073 --> 53:30.806
    -Are you charging him?      
           -Not yet.            

53:30.808 --> 53:32.374
        -Didn't think so.       

53:37.248 --> 53:38.547
       -We'll be calling.       

53:38.549 --> 53:41.417
        -Yes, we will.          
        -(door closes)          

53:42.553 --> 53:43.752
             -Dick.             

53:44.889 --> 53:46.689
     So, what do you think?     

53:46.691 --> 53:48.357
-Well, I think we need to find  
     the two Mexican guys       

53:48.359 --> 53:50.960
   and this mysterious Luke.    

53:52.863 --> 53:54.263
            -Oh, yeah.          

53:57.768 --> 54:01.704
         -Like I said,          
    I ain't going nowhere.      

54:01.706 --> 54:03.906
    And if I get arrested,      
  you're gonna be my lawyer.    

54:03.908 --> 54:05.307
     And if I get convicted,    

54:05.309 --> 54:09.612
     you better believe         
    I'm gonna cut a deal.       

54:11.115 --> 54:14.783
 Hey,<i> cabron,</i> it's not my fault 
        you got spooked         

54:14.785 --> 54:17.386
      and had me rush out       
of that house last minute, okay?

54:17.388 --> 54:20.155
          You see,              
   the blame falls on you.      

54:20.157 --> 54:21.423
       -You piece of shit,      

54:21.425 --> 54:22.992
     you actually think         
    you can blackmail us?       

54:22.994 --> 54:24.893
     -It's not blackmail,       
          it's facts.           

54:24.895 --> 54:27.896
  You see, if I get fucked,     
       he gets fucked.          

54:27.898 --> 54:29.865
        Or how about            
   I go back to that house      

54:29.867 --> 54:31.800
 and fuck that pretty little    
whore wife too, motherfucker.   

54:31.802 --> 54:34.670
          -Easy, easy.          
 You don't wanna play that game.

54:34.672 --> 54:36.639
           -Really?             
   I like that game though.     

54:36.641 --> 54:40.876
   Or maybe I end the game      
and kill you both, right now?   

54:42.346 --> 54:44.346
 -You ain't that fucking stupid.

54:55.059 --> 54:56.959
         -(gunshot)             
       -What the fuck.          

54:58.362 --> 55:00.162
        -I didn't know          
     what the fuck to do.       

55:00.164 --> 55:01.630
        -So you fucking         
        killed the guy?         

55:01.632 --> 55:03.432
       Where'd you even         
         get the gun?           

55:03.434 --> 55:04.933
    -I got it for protection.   

55:04.935 --> 55:07.569
 He was gonna kill us, Lucas.   
     He was gonna kill us.      

55:10.608 --> 55:11.874
             -Fuck!             

55:14.645 --> 55:15.944
              Fuck!             

55:17.782 --> 55:20.049
    One big fucking spiral      
      with you, isn't it?       

55:21.285 --> 55:22.551
    First you wanna kill Kim,   

55:22.553 --> 55:25.220
      and now you shoot         
      this fucking guy.         

55:25.222 --> 55:26.622
     What's wrong with you?     

55:28.793 --> 55:30.826
       -Listen, maybe           
    this is for the best.       

55:30.828 --> 55:33.228
  Now we don't have to worry    
      about him talking.        

55:33.230 --> 55:34.630
              -We?              

55:34.632 --> 55:35.798
               We.              

55:35.800 --> 55:37.232
   Now let's get one thing      
          straight.             

55:37.234 --> 55:38.434
         This is not--          
       There's no "we."         

55:38.436 --> 55:39.835
          You did this.         

55:41.639 --> 55:42.838
            -I know!            

55:45.076 --> 55:49.044
   -All right, let's just       
  get the fuck out of here.     

55:49.046 --> 55:50.312
            Come on.            

55:50.314 --> 55:52.114
        -So, what are we        
   gonna do about the body?     

55:52.116 --> 55:53.782
           -The body?           

55:53.784 --> 55:55.617
      I'm not touching          
     that fucking thing.        

55:55.619 --> 55:58.120
        Grab your money         
    and let's go. Come on.      

56:18.743 --> 56:20.609
       -They shot him           
     in the face, homes.        

56:20.611 --> 56:22.378
    We got to get that <i> puta.</i>    

56:42.133 --> 56:43.532
             -Lucas.            

56:44.735 --> 56:46.135
           I'm sorry            
  I lost my cool back there.    

56:46.137 --> 56:48.570
   That will not happen again.  

56:48.572 --> 56:50.606
       -I'm your lawyer         
     and I'm your friend,       

56:50.608 --> 56:52.741
      but I can't go down       
 this road with you any more.   

56:52.743 --> 56:55.644
   What you did back there      
     was fucking crazy.         

56:55.646 --> 56:57.179
        I'm fucking done.       

56:58.382 --> 56:59.782
      -What do you mean         
        you're done?            

57:01.185 --> 57:04.119
       -Done. We're done.       

57:04.121 --> 57:06.588
      I'm not doing this        
       with you anymore.        

57:08.125 --> 57:09.525
     Don't fucking call me.     

57:18.436 --> 57:22.504
       (car engine starts)      

57:34.218 --> 57:40.155

58:50.127 --> 58:52.127
         I don't know           
     what I was thinking.       

58:59.603 --> 59:01.303
       I'm really scared.       

59:04.375 --> 59:06.141
   The detective said that...   

59:07.678 --> 59:11.313
   the killers might have       
  mistook you for that guy.     

59:15.819 --> 59:18.220
      Is there something        
    you're not telling me?      

59:26.530 --> 59:28.096
         -How could you?        

59:39.643 --> 59:41.910
     He meant nothing to me.    

59:43.514 --> 59:45.080
           I love you.          

59:54.658 --> 59:56.959
   Can you please forgive me?   

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.134
     I'll never do it again.    

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:10.305
              Hmm?

   You're the only one for me.  

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:20.148
         I love you.            
         I love you.            

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:35.964

  I don't want to lose you.

       I'll do anything.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:27.282
        Go get the door.        

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:38.493
     -Mr. Schaefer, sorry       
 to disturb you at home, sir.   

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:40.462
 We just wanted to follow up    
 with a few more questions,     

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:41.730
      if that's all right.      

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:43.298
         -Yeah, sure.           
    What can I do for you?      

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.866
    -Well, after speaking       
    with your assistant,        

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.301
we were just wondering as to why
        you would cancel        

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:50.472
    your anniversary trip       
   to Hawaii this weekend?      

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.774
       -Well, honestly,         
  in light of the situation,    

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:54.509
    why would I go to Hawaii?   

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:56.712
      -Yeah, that's what        
     we don't understand.       

01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:57.979
          You see,              
  you canceled your tickets     

01:01:57.981 --> 01:01:59.781
   before your business trip.   

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:01.616
      Before the murder         
      even took place.          

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.585
   -Let me get this straight.   

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:06.221
 You fucking came to my house   
    at 10 o'clock at night      

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.156
           to ask me            
    if I canceled tickets?      

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.058
         I honestly             
 can't even fucking remember    

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.660
          what I had            
    for fucking breakfast,      

01:02:11.662 --> 01:02:14.429
   much else when I canceled    
the ticket or booked the ticket.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.364
 I book flights all the time,   
I cancel flights all the time,  

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:19.668
      I just-- I just don't     
 understand where this is going.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:22.137
    Do you have any other       
      questions for me?         

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:25.040
           -Nope.               
      -BOTH: That's it.         

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:26.308
           -Yeah.               
     -Have a good night.        

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.909
     -Have a good night.        
       -Yeah, you too.          

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.578
            -Okay.              
         -Good night.           

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:35.016
       (door clicks shut)       

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:42.157
           -Come here.          

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:58.306
          (whispers)            
    It's going to be okay.      

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:02.277
     (Kim sobs and sniffles)    

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.980
    It's going to be okay.      
          All right?            

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:07.816
      -Let's go to bed.         
      -Okay. (sniffles)         

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:10.852
         -I love you.           
       -I love you too.         

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:14.089
         -(smooches)            
          -Come on.             

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:27.102
   (suspenseful theme playing)  

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:11.880
 -Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:13.081
             -What?             

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.883
     -I just saw something.     

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.153
   -What? What did you see?     
          -Something.           

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:21.656
         I don't know,          
  like a light or something.    

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:23.024
        -You shitting me?       

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:26.228
   -No, no. Somebody shot       
     a light in there.          

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:27.729
    -Are you waking me up       
       'cause somebody          

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.497
   decides to take a piss       
 in the middle of the night?    

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:31.199
        -Man, stop it.          
  -Okay... wait, wait, wait.    

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:35.303
      Who takes a piss with     
a flashlight in their own house?

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:37.372
   -A flash-- Are you sure      
    it was a flashlight?        

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.374
      -It seemed like it.       
  Like one of those Maglites    

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.109
        up on that beam.        

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:43.278
Okay, tell me you didn't just   
     see that right now.        

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.880
      -Yeah, yeah, yeah,        
           I saw it.            

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.181
     What the fuck is that?     

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.149
  -Should I call in for backup? 

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:50.719
    -No, no, just inform them   

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:52.654
     that we're going to        
  take a look at the house.     

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:54.389
    But it could be nothing.    

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.992
      We don't wanna look       
  like a bunch of jackasses.    

01:04:56.994 --> 01:04:59.361
         -Okay then.            
   -What the fuck is that?      

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:01.897
  -Be advised, Detective Reyes  
      and Detective Jones       

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.865
         will be going          
     into the Schaefer home     

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:06.201
        to check out            
     a suspicious light.        

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:14.042
   (suspenseful theme playing)  

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:33.395
        (knocks on wood)        

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:38.700
             -Psst.             

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.268
     -Who the fuck is that?     

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.137
   -What'd you think, homey?    

01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:43.805
   You thought we were just     
   gonna walk away or what?     

01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:45.173
           (screams)            

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:46.775
 -What the fuck are you doing   
         in my house?           

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:49.844
 -What the fuck is going on?    
     Who are these guys?        

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:51.379
           (cocks gun)          

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:54.582
  -Now you're fucking stupid,   
             dawg.              

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:55.784
          (Kim sobbing)         

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:58.386
My cousin comes over here       
 to collects the money,         

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.022
 next thing I know, he's dead   
    on Channel 7 News, huh?     

01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:02.424
   -Now, wait, wait, wait.      
    Just wait, just wait.       

01:06:02.426 --> 01:06:04.326
      Just wait. Listen,        
     we have money, okay?       

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:05.727
        We'll give you          
      whatever you want,        

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:06.928
     just leave us alone.       
            Please.             

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:09.030
       -Fuck that, bro.         
          I saw you.            

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:10.432
       I was up in the          
    fucking hills, homey.       

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.735
 -Jeff, what are they talking   
            about?              

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.370
    -Shut the fuck up, bitch.   

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:17.238
Let me tell you what the fuck   
 we're talking about, homey.    

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.873
          Your little           
 bitch-ass husband right here   

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:20.709
  hired us to kill your ass,    
   that's 'cause you were       

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:22.043
      fucking the postman.      

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:23.678
     -Listen, just fucking      
    leave her out of this.      

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.879
She had nothing to do with this.

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:26.214
    -Right. You shut up, man.   

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.682
     She's got everything       
       to do with this.         

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.184
            -Jeff?              
        -That's right.          

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:35.090
  Don't fucking listen to him,  
           all right?           

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.558
Don't fucking listen to them.   
         All right?             

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.625
        (Kim sobs loudly)       

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.361
-Hey, shut your fucking bitch   
         up, homey.             

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:41.830
    -Leave her out of this!     
   -BOTH: Shut the fuck up!     

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:45.133
        -Fucking slut.          
      -(Kim sobs loudly)        

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.601
       -Hey, white girl.        
          -(gunshot)            

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.707
             -No!               
     (Jeff cries loudly)        

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:01.282
     -And now you're next.      

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.121
  I love killing white people.  

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:09.991
     -You fucking cowards!      
      You fucking cowards!      

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:11.960
        Go on. You think        
     you're fucking tough?      

01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:14.162
            Go on.              
    Shoot me, you fuckers.      

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.664
           -Go on.              
       -With pleasure.

             -Jones.            

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:29.277
  Officer down! Shots fired!    
  Officer down! I need help!    

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.846
     Jones, come on baby.       
     Jones, come on, man.       

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:34.182
Come on, don't do this to me,   
       baby, come on.           

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:38.119
     You okay over there?       
         -JEFF: Yeah.           

01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:47.662
   -Jones, come on now, Jones,  
stay with me, stay with me, man.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:49.197
             Jones.             

01:07:56.039 --> 01:07:58.139
    -Slide the gun over here.   

01:08:03.013 --> 01:08:06.381
            I said,             
   slide the gun over here.     

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:11.119
             -Do it.            

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.294
-You don't want to do this, man.

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:21.696
    -Don't fucking tell me      
       what I wanna do.         

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:24.299
    Don't fucking tell me       
    what I wanna do, man.       

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:26.801
 -Are you going to kill me, huh?

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:29.104
          You think             
  that's going to help you?     

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:31.738
          -It might.            
     -(Jeff sobs quietly)       

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:37.345
     You are at a major         
    crossroad here, Jeff.       

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:43.318
   -I didn't kill that kid.     
    I didn't kill that kid.     

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:46.421
   -I didn't kill that kid!     
            -Okay.              

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:49.791
     So why don't you just      
        put the gun down        

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.227
  and we'll sort this all out,  
          you and me.           

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:54.562
     Right here, right now.     

01:08:56.099 --> 01:09:00.535
   -If I put this gun down,     
 then I'm going to jail, man.   

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:08.843
   -Jeff... what do you think   
is going to happen if you don't?

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:12.580
        -I'm sorry, man.        
 I need you to get on your face.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.215
             -Jeff.             

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.884
   -Get down on the ground,     
       like I told you.         

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:17.285
             -Jeff.             

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.721
     -Get on your face. Now.    

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:24.259
      -I got a family.          
 Don't do this to them, man.    

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:27.795
          -Shut up!             
     I had a family too.        

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.331
     -And now I'm ruined.       
       -I get it, Jeff.         

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.933
     Just don't do it, man.     

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:34.368
         Think about            
   what you're doing, man!      

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:37.538
         (shouting)             
       Think about it!          

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:40.441
      -I'm going to jail        
   for the rest of my life.     

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:44.645
   There's only one thing,      
         one thing,             

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.447
  that's going to keep that     
       from happening.          

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:49.651
      -Just think about         
       my family, man.          

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.386
        Please. Wait.           
Wait, wait, wait, Jeff. Jeff.   

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:53.787
     -Jeff, don't-- No!
