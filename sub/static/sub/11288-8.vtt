WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:06.206
Prepare to give me my props.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.612
This woman comes
into my office screaming

00:11.678 --> 00:13.379
that the garbage men
on our block

00:13.446 --> 00:16.015
bang in the cans and leave
trash all over the place.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.018
Oh, you mean like
you in our kitchen.

00:19.385 --> 00:21.722
So I called
the Sanitation Department

00:21.788 --> 00:24.758
and I tell them unless
they clean up their act

00:24.825 --> 00:28.929
they'll be in the Bronx Zoo
on doo‐doo detail!

00:30.964 --> 00:32.298
[vehicle beeping]

00:32.365 --> 00:34.267
Hey, what the freak
is goin' on?

00:34.334 --> 00:36.703
[crash]

00:36.770 --> 00:39.773
Oh, they're dumping garbage
in front of Max's house.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.711
Hey, Max, do we decorate?

00:46.713 --> 00:49.983
Hey! I'm Alderwoman Shaw!

00:50.050 --> 00:52.218
What the hell are you doing?

01:00.026 --> 01:03.203
"Let us know if you have
any more constructive criticism.

01:03.269 --> 01:05.806
Yours infield sanitation
workers, Local 318."

01:07.874 --> 01:09.342
Well, it's a good thing
you didn't piss off

01:09.408 --> 01:10.877
the guys at the morgue.

01:10.944 --> 01:12.879
They would've dumped
the stiff on your stoop.

01:14.447 --> 01:16.883
Yeah, we've seen Max's dates.

‐ 'Hey, what's up, man?'

02:06.773 --> 02:08.374
Overton, mail call.

02:08.441 --> 02:10.243
Oh, Kyle,
this is the sacred seal

02:10.310 --> 02:13.146
of our alma mater
Carver High school

02:13.213 --> 02:15.181
home of the Battling Badgers.

02:17.383 --> 02:18.885
Yeah, well, it seems
they're closing the school down

02:18.952 --> 02:20.654
because of an asbestos problem.

02:20.721 --> 02:23.657
Man, there's no way on Earth
the hallowed halls of our school

02:23.724 --> 02:25.659
could be insulated
with asbestos.

02:25.726 --> 02:27.260
[coughs]

02:29.730 --> 02:31.464
Yeah, well, they're holding
a farewell gala

02:31.532 --> 02:32.766
for all the alums.

02:32.833 --> 02:35.502
Oh, hey,
I'm Cleveland bound then.

02:35.569 --> 02:38.371
Um, care to take a stroll
down memory lane

02:38.438 --> 02:40.373
with me, my foxy fiance?

02:43.076 --> 02:44.410
I'd be honored.

02:44.477 --> 02:46.279
I flipped through your yearbook
so many times

02:46.346 --> 02:48.348
I feel I know every
pimple‐peppered face.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.852
‐ I'm not going.
‐ Oh, no, no, no.

02:51.918 --> 02:53.820
I know what this is about.

02:53.887 --> 02:56.990
You're afraid you're gonna
run into Lester Tate.

02:57.057 --> 02:59.425
‐ Who's Lester Tate?
‐ Lester Tate.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.576
Brother, please, look,
I have completely forgotten

03:09.643 --> 03:12.312
about that heartless Neanderthal
who put marmalade in my sneakers

03:12.378 --> 03:13.747
and made me wear 'em
on the field trip

03:13.814 --> 03:15.281
to the museum of rubber.

03:16.817 --> 03:19.185
Yeah, well, if you've forgotten
all about it, how come

03:19.252 --> 03:21.588
your lips wrapped around
your favorite comfort food?

03:22.789 --> 03:26.326
Can't a man enjoy a Funyun..

03:29.763 --> 03:31.865
...without being psychoanalyzed?

03:31.932 --> 03:33.734
Look, Kyle, if you don't go
to the reunion

03:33.800 --> 03:35.335
it's just another victory
for Lester.

03:35.401 --> 03:36.970
Well, you know, if you go,
you could show him

03:37.037 --> 03:38.238
how the Kyle caterpillar

03:38.304 --> 03:40.406
has turned into
the Barker butterfly.

03:42.375 --> 03:43.510
Or you can just sit here

03:43.577 --> 03:46.246
and turn into
the Barker butterball.

03:48.181 --> 03:49.816
Alright, admit it, Overton,
the only reason

03:49.883 --> 03:51.484
why you want me in attendance

03:51.552 --> 03:55.121
is so that I can jump‐start
our famous pop‐locking routine.

03:55.188 --> 03:57.457
Yeah, well, I have to admit
it wouldn't be the same

03:57.524 --> 04:01.434
without Carver's breaking crew
Spaghetti and Meatball.

04:03.036 --> 04:04.638
Alright, if it means
that much to you

04:04.705 --> 04:06.640
then Meatball
will be in attendance.

04:06.707 --> 04:08.274
Alright then.

04:08.341 --> 04:09.342
Uh, yo, Meatball.

04:10.944 --> 04:13.213
Don't even try to roll up
out of here with our bowl.

04:28.729 --> 04:30.764
Max, it stinks in here.

04:30.831 --> 04:33.833
You better call them
garbage people up and apologize.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.669
Well, how do you know that
this has anything to do with me

04:35.735 --> 04:36.970
Chicken Little?

04:39.372 --> 04:41.775
Because they spell
Surrender Shaw

04:41.842 --> 04:43.810
in chicken bones
on the side wall.

04:45.345 --> 04:47.948
Hey, it smells like garbage
under a Christmas tree in here.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.986
Look, Max, get on the phone
and fix the funk.

04:54.655 --> 04:56.557
Look, I was just
elected alderwoman.

04:56.623 --> 04:58.825
Now if I, if I give in now

04:58.892 --> 05:00.460
it sends a message
that everyone in government

05:00.527 --> 05:02.503
can just walk all over me.

05:02.569 --> 05:05.271
Okay, let me clarify
the situation for you.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.574
Regine and me
living with garbage

05:07.641 --> 05:12.278
is like you being barefoot
and pregnant and liking it.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.482
For real?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.187
Oh, girl, I'm sorry.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.425
I wouldn't wish that
even on you.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.027
Well, alright,
I mean, I'll set up a meeting

05:27.093 --> 05:28.829
with the union rep right away.

05:28.895 --> 05:31.131
I'm, you know,
I mean, I have half tempted

05:31.197 --> 05:33.466
to pay you back that money
I owe you, girl. I'm sorry.

care to dance?

Well, I'm glad, too,
but I‐I'm not Helen.

for nothing.

07:50.884 --> 07:53.687
O Dub Jones.

07:53.754 --> 07:56.489
I told you that that Jheri curl
would make your hair fall out.

07:58.491 --> 08:01.201
Yeah, and I told you that
impersonating a gynecologist

08:01.267 --> 08:03.904
would land you in jail, too,
didn't I?

08:03.970 --> 08:05.939
O Dub, tell me.

08:06.006 --> 08:09.543
What happened to that chunky guy
you used to hang with?

08:11.578 --> 08:13.446
I'm surprised you came.

08:13.514 --> 08:15.115
Why, you didn't think
a stockbroker on the rise

08:15.181 --> 08:16.517
would come out
for something like this, huh?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.952
No, I didn't think
Lester Tate's whipping boy

08:19.019 --> 08:21.087
would ever come back to Carver.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.991
You gotta tell me,
how did he get you

08:27.460 --> 08:28.862

‐ Mm‐hmm.

on therapy?

08:44.611 --> 08:45.546
Come again?

08:45.612 --> 08:48.481
Well, Barker,
if Lester Tate put me

08:48.549 --> 08:50.684
through half the hell
he put you through

08:50.751 --> 08:54.755
I'd be hooked up to electrodes
24 hours a day.

08:54.821 --> 08:56.122
Yeah, well, Carl, all of that

08:56.189 --> 08:57.958
is water
under the bridge now, okay?

08:58.024 --> 08:59.860
What? Even after
he dissed you at the prom?

08:59.926 --> 09:01.234
See, that shows
how much you know.

09:01.301 --> 09:02.335
I didn't even go to my prom.

09:02.402 --> 09:04.137
My date canceled
at the last minute.

09:04.204 --> 09:05.539
Of course, she did.

09:05.606 --> 09:08.542
Lester told her that you were
bragging to the whole school

09:08.609 --> 09:10.911
that you would have her under
the bleachers by midnight.

09:13.379 --> 09:16.016
You mean, you didn't know?

09:16.082 --> 09:18.084
Ah, no, no one told me.

09:19.219 --> 09:20.754
Is Lester here?

09:20.821 --> 09:23.489
Well, you don't have a wedgie,
so I guess not.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.762
Yoo‐hoo! Smile, Helen!

09:32.633 --> 09:35.001
Oh, I, I don't mean
to rain on your parade

09:35.068 --> 09:36.402
but I'm not Helen.

09:36.469 --> 09:38.404
Maybe she's just not coming.

09:40.507 --> 09:43.143
Oh, don't waste your time.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.711
That's not Helen.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.214
What?

09:48.281 --> 09:50.884
Did you say Helen?

09:50.951 --> 09:52.986
Forgive me,
I thought you said Ellen.

09:53.053 --> 09:55.021
Of course, I'm Helen.

09:56.256 --> 09:57.691
I knew it!

09:57.758 --> 09:59.993
Hey, everybody, it's Helen!

10:02.636 --> 10:04.204
[indistinct conversation]

10:05.672 --> 10:08.241
Overton, look, man,
I'm leaving.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.845
‐ What's wrong, dawg?
‐ Man, I'm so furious right now.

10:11.912 --> 10:15.415
If I saw Lester, I might
actually do him bodily harm.

10:15.481 --> 10:19.285
Or open your mouth and dump
the entire buffet table into it.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.556
‐ Anyway, I'm out, alright.
‐ Alright.

10:24.490 --> 10:25.859
Man, what's wrong
with you, dawg?

10:25.926 --> 10:28.294
‐ You got hand all up over me.
‐ My apologies, man.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.131
Wait a minute.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.600
You're the one
who eats like a horse

10:33.667 --> 10:35.869
and talks like a horse's ass.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.206
Kyle Barker.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.808
Lester Tate.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.419
You've got something you wanna
say to me, huh, Barker?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.924
Ah, maybe he does
and maybe he doesn't.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.702
Look, O Dub, I got
my own back man, alright.

11:01.768 --> 11:03.837
Umm, alright, hey,
handle your business.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.074
Now, Lester, I got something
I've been wanting to say to you

11:08.141 --> 11:09.175
ever since threw me down

11:09.242 --> 11:12.345
and played jungle boogie
on my stomach, huh?

11:12.412 --> 11:14.180
Look, man, you've got
the soul of a coward.

11:14.247 --> 11:16.783
You picked on people
you knew wouldn't fight back.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.154
The little people, the nerds

11:21.221 --> 11:22.589
the robust.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.359
Hey, take a look
around you, Lester.

11:28.294 --> 11:32.799
All your former victims are
now doctors and‐and handymen

11:32.866 --> 11:36.336
and handsome funds managers.

11:36.402 --> 11:38.338
So now what do you have
to say for yourself?

11:40.006 --> 11:41.742
As a matter of fact,
I'm nothing.

11:41.808 --> 11:44.578
‐ Uh‐huh. See?
‐ Hmm, I know.

11:44.645 --> 11:47.848
Haven't even had a job
in over a year.

11:47.914 --> 11:50.817
My unemployment check ran out
on me six weeks ago

11:50.884 --> 11:52.418
and so did my wife.

11:53.854 --> 11:56.523
She took the car,
she took the kids

11:56.590 --> 11:58.525
and she took the dog.

11:59.726 --> 12:01.668
I miss my dog.

12:03.504 --> 12:05.438
I'm livin' on my grand mama's
back porch.

12:06.907 --> 12:10.143
But I'm glad to see
that you're doing well.

12:11.512 --> 12:13.847
And if it makes you
feel any better

12:13.914 --> 12:15.849
keep on pickin'
on the homeless guy.

12:17.684 --> 12:19.452
Um, man.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.889
Uh, look, Lester,
I‐I had no idea, man‐‐

12:22.956 --> 12:26.126
Well, it's a little
late now, isn't it?

12:26.192 --> 12:28.494
Come on, Lester baby,
I'm gonna fix you a plate.

12:35.969 --> 12:37.303
That's bad.

12:37.370 --> 12:39.405
He had that dog
since we was in school.

12:41.374 --> 12:43.544
You guys are so great.
You guys are great.

12:43.610 --> 12:44.678
You‐you know what?

12:44.745 --> 12:49.382
I used to love
when you did the Helen.

12:51.484 --> 12:54.621
The Helen, I loved that dance.

12:54.688 --> 12:56.757
‐ Oh, come on, do it!
‐ Do it, do it!

12:56.823 --> 13:00.934
Oh! Oh, I haven't Helen
in years.

13:01.001 --> 13:02.736
Well, okay, woo.

13:04.671 --> 13:06.773
Wait a minute there!

13:07.841 --> 13:09.776
That's not the Helen.

13:11.144 --> 13:12.779
That's better than the Helen.

13:12.846 --> 13:14.314
[crowd cheering]

13:14.380 --> 13:16.316
You're a dancing machine.

13:18.652 --> 13:20.386
Umm, look here, Kyle.

13:20.453 --> 13:22.889
I'm takin' up a collection
to get Lester a new dog.

13:25.491 --> 13:28.461
Man, he already has my dignity.
What more does he want?

13:28.529 --> 13:30.096
Oh, cheer up, Kyle.

13:30.163 --> 13:31.798
I mean, when you laid into him

13:31.865 --> 13:34.300
you had no idea he was lower
than a worm's belly.

13:35.702 --> 13:37.638
You know, my mean display
back there made me realize

13:37.704 --> 13:40.974
a part of me is still stuck
in that 10th grade, man.

13:41.041 --> 13:43.944
I guess I need to admit
I'm just a big and..

13:44.010 --> 13:46.312
...soon‐to‐be fat phony.

13:46.379 --> 13:48.181
Look on the bright side.

13:48.248 --> 13:50.617
Keep eating like that
and you will be able to fit

13:50.684 --> 13:52.753
into your prom tux again.

13:54.387 --> 13:55.589
[knock on door]

13:55.656 --> 13:57.257
Okay, okay, listen.

13:57.323 --> 13:59.526
That is the sanitation honcho.

14:00.326 --> 14:02.335
I'll do all the talking.

14:02.402 --> 14:04.337
Khadijah, you sit there and

14:04.404 --> 14:06.472
and look really tough and

14:06.540 --> 14:08.474
Regine, you stuff your wig
in your mouth, alright.

14:13.013 --> 14:14.280
Alderwoman Shaw?

14:14.347 --> 14:18.384
Yes, I am Alderwoman Shaw.

14:18.451 --> 14:21.555
Kenneth Reed, Department
of Sanitation, local 318.

14:21.622 --> 14:23.724
She's sorry.
She's so damn sorry.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.726
She'll never do it again.
Coffee?

14:27.227 --> 14:29.329
Look, Mr. Reed,
I called you over here

14:29.395 --> 14:32.298
so we could discuss
how this trash malfeasance

14:32.365 --> 14:34.467
has affected
two of my constituents.

14:34.535 --> 14:38.004
Yeah, now I know Brooklyn trash

14:38.071 --> 14:39.740
and that's not it.

14:39.806 --> 14:42.342
You've been trucking that mess
in from Staten Island.

14:44.778 --> 14:47.648
Pound cake?
Sugar cookie? Grits?

14:49.616 --> 14:52.085
Ma'am, I'm dealing
with a sensitive group

14:52.152 --> 14:54.054
of sanitation engineers

14:54.120 --> 14:56.757
and when they have to deal
with a rude politician

14:56.823 --> 14:58.091
it upsets them.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.726
They forget things.

14:59.793 --> 15:02.335
Like the fact that the city dump
is not in front of your house.

15:05.872 --> 15:08.909
Apologize
to the nice garbage man.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.813
Hell, no.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.250
Apologize.

15:21.487 --> 15:22.756
I'm sorry..

15:24.090 --> 15:26.292
...that I yelled at your men

15:26.359 --> 15:28.695
and called them a bunch of
beer‐swilling trash monkeys.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.332
Apology accepted.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.900
Miss Shaw,
you're new to politics

15:33.967 --> 15:36.570
so let me explain the hierarchy
of the city to you.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.773
Alderman.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.174
City Council.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.776
Mayor.

15:42.843 --> 15:44.044
Garbage men.

15:45.879 --> 15:46.980
God.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.383
Point taken.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.018
Just make sure
you don't bang the cans

15:52.085 --> 15:54.454
or I'll go over your head.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.357
Alderwoman Shaw,
you remind me of my mother.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.767
Except she's white and dead.

16:02.569 --> 16:03.837
Allow me.

16:10.777 --> 16:12.979
Do you see that?

16:13.046 --> 16:16.216
That just showed you
who's boss around here.

16:16.282 --> 16:17.984
Well, there, boss lady.

16:18.051 --> 16:19.452
You might wanna go
after your flunky.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.454
He just left with our laundry.

16:24.725 --> 16:26.793
How many bullets
in this gun, Chino?

16:28.228 --> 16:29.395
That was you?

16:29.462 --> 16:30.864
Or maybe it's you.

16:30.931 --> 16:32.633
Or maybe me.

16:32.699 --> 16:34.635
You all killed my Tony.

16:38.839 --> 16:42.208
Thank you, thank you.
No, thank you!

16:47.313 --> 16:49.382
Umm, lookie here, Maria.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.320
I think this whole Helen thing
is a bit dishonest.

16:54.387 --> 16:56.623
A bit dishonest? I'm lying
through my teeth out there.

16:58.224 --> 16:59.459
Yeah, well, be that as it may

16:59.526 --> 17:02.603
Overton came here
to show off his baby, right?

17:02.669 --> 17:04.738
But you're here
showin' off Helen.

17:04.805 --> 17:07.808
Oh, I was thinking
of the masses and not you.

17:08.809 --> 17:10.777
Oh, I'm sorry, oh.

17:14.114 --> 17:15.715
Attention, everyone, please.

17:18.117 --> 17:22.689
I have a confession to make.
I'm not this Helen you revere.

17:22.756 --> 17:24.891
The truth is my name
is Synclaire James.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.060
There, I said it.

17:27.127 --> 17:29.530
[laughs]
Oh.

17:29.596 --> 17:32.633
You almost got us again, Helen.
Oh, a kidder.

17:35.435 --> 17:37.704
Come on. Do "Color Purple."

17:41.708 --> 17:42.843
[clears throat]

17:44.077 --> 17:46.012
You sure is ugly.

17:51.852 --> 17:54.888
Well, she was headed
for the freeway, true

17:54.955 --> 17:57.057
but I guess
she missed the horn round.

17:58.859 --> 18:01.067
Perhaps I'll have better luck.

18:01.134 --> 18:03.069
I'm gonna seek out Lester
and apologize.

18:05.706 --> 18:07.641
Synclaire.

18:07.708 --> 18:08.975
I'm Helen Robinson

18:09.042 --> 18:10.977
the woman you've been
impersonating all evening.

18:11.912 --> 18:14.214
Um, my bad.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.949
Uh, allow me to explain, please.

18:16.016 --> 18:18.118
I have several
multiple personalities

18:18.184 --> 18:20.821
although they're not
all mine and so‐‐

18:20.887 --> 18:22.455
Look, I wanna thank you, okay?

18:22.523 --> 18:24.124
High school
was an exhausting time for me.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.126
Always somebody,
do the impressions

18:26.192 --> 18:29.062
oh, do The Helen,
oh, make us laugh.

18:29.129 --> 18:31.998
Girl, these folks
will suck you dry.

18:32.065 --> 18:33.834
Girl, you ain't said nothing
but the word.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.002
I am sweating
like a racehorse, yes!

18:36.069 --> 18:37.470
Well, it's just good
to see somebody else

18:37.538 --> 18:40.173
making an ass of herself
for a change.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.308
Well, it is a gift.

18:47.848 --> 18:48.915
Lester?

18:50.784 --> 18:53.386
Barker, man, why don't you find
your own hallway to work?

18:53.453 --> 18:57.357
Man, you're here rippin' off
high school kids?

18:57.423 --> 19:00.767
Technically, I'm rippin' off
the parents.

19:00.834 --> 19:03.970
Cha ching.
Lookie here, lookie here.

19:04.037 --> 19:06.372
Two hundred dollar
pair of tennis shoes.

19:06.439 --> 19:08.441
Now they sure to hell
beat them saddle shoes

19:08.509 --> 19:10.443
I used to snatch off
your feet, don't it?

19:11.745 --> 19:13.847
Uh, look, Lester, man,
I came to apologize.

19:13.914 --> 19:15.549
When I berated you earlier

19:15.616 --> 19:19.285
I didn't realize the extent
of your misfortunes.

19:19.352 --> 19:21.321
Oh, you hurt me deep,
you know.

19:22.823 --> 19:24.758
You wanna buy a new pair
of tennis shoes?

19:26.426 --> 19:27.528
I got a proposition
for you, man.

19:27.594 --> 19:31.197
You put those back
and, uh, this is yours.

19:31.264 --> 19:33.166
‐ Fifty dollars?
‐ Yeah.

19:33.233 --> 19:36.402
Man, I can get at least a C‐note
of buck 50 for these.

19:38.505 --> 19:41.374
You know,
for a big‐time stockbroker

19:41.441 --> 19:44.144
you don't know jack about
the free mortgage system.

19:47.413 --> 19:50.150
Why do I even try to treat you
like a human being, man?

19:53.086 --> 19:54.254
You know why?

19:55.522 --> 19:57.490
Cause' I scare the crap
out of you, that's why.

19:58.959 --> 20:01.234
Now why don't you give me
your wallet for old times' sake?

20:04.370 --> 20:08.575
Lester, this ain't old times
and I'm a grown man.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.877
You ain't nothing
but a tie joke, bruh.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.882
Well, well, well.

20:15.949 --> 20:19.553
Look who went to New York
and bought himself a backbone.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.557
Look here, Lester,
before you double dog dare me

20:23.624 --> 20:25.992
to put up my dukes,
let me ask you a question, bruh.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.294
How did somebody who comes
from the same place as me

20:28.361 --> 20:31.765
had the same opportunities as me
end up as self‐loathing

20:31.832 --> 20:33.767
and pathetic as you?

20:34.968 --> 20:36.236
Could you keep your hands off

20:36.302 --> 20:38.905
just a teeny‐weeny
bit short, huh?

20:41.074 --> 20:44.545
Lester, man,
you could have had a career

20:44.611 --> 20:46.212
friends, family

20:46.279 --> 20:47.714
but you chose to push
everybody away

20:47.781 --> 20:50.283
so now you're a lonely old man

20:50.350 --> 20:52.085
jackin' teenagers.

20:52.152 --> 20:55.021
And I am sorry if that was
not short enough for you.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.959
‐ Is that all?
‐ Yeah, that's it.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.434
Well, bring it on, man!

21:01.502 --> 21:03.436
Ah, damn, man,
is that a Walkman in there?

21:03.504 --> 21:04.605
Where?

21:10.376 --> 21:11.912
'Hey, man!'

21:11.978 --> 21:14.014
'Let me up out of here.
I'm claustrophobes.'

21:18.284 --> 21:20.286
I will be sure
to alert the authorities

21:20.353 --> 21:22.556
after the party is over.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.060
Anybody else want some?

21:28.461 --> 21:30.396
'It's getting dark, man.
Come on.'

21:39.439 --> 21:41.908
