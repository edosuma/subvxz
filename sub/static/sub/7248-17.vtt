WEBVTT

00:04.480 --> 00:05.772
Tell me what happened.

00:05.856 --> 00:08.316
We just broke up.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.609
I don't understand.

00:10.652 --> 00:14.071
We went to dinner,
and then we walked by the bonfire...

00:14.155 --> 00:15.531
but it wasn't lit.

00:15.656 --> 00:19.534
So we went to this junkyard,
and we sat in this car and... Oh, God!

00:19.952 --> 00:22.579
- What?
- I forgot your meatball in the car.

00:22.663 --> 00:24.039
Honey, forget it.

00:24.122 --> 00:26.582
I can't believe
I left your meatball in the car.

00:26.666 --> 00:28.334
Okay, come on.

00:28.418 --> 00:31.379
After I told the waiter to wrap it up
and everything.

00:31.462 --> 00:34.423
And everyone was like,
'What do you want with one meatball?'

00:34.507 --> 00:36.425
I said, 'It's a mother-daughter thing. '

00:36.509 --> 00:38.927
I'm sure he thought I was nuts,
but he was so nice.

00:39.011 --> 00:40.971
And he did it anyway.

00:41.179 --> 00:44.431
He brought one of those
little tinfoil swans or a duck...

00:44.516 --> 00:48.102
or some kind of bird
and then I left it in the car.

00:48.186 --> 00:51.147
Forget about the meatball.
Just tell me what happened.

00:51.230 --> 00:52.689
He just broke up with me.

00:52.773 --> 00:56.067
This doesn't make any sense.
This is Dean we're talking about.

00:56.151 --> 00:58.653
He's crazy about you.
He calls 25 times a day.

00:58.737 --> 01:02.198
The cover of his notebook
is one step away from stalker material.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.241
- I have to go to bed.
- Wait.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.493
- Take me through the night step by step.
- Why?

01:06.536 --> 01:08.412
So I can help decipher
what happened here.

01:08.496 --> 01:12.291
We broke up. He didn't wanna be
my boyfriend anymore, end of story.

01:12.374 --> 01:14.292
- So not end of story.
- Yes, it is.

01:14.376 --> 01:17.086
He did not plan a romantic evening
complete with dinner...

01:17.170 --> 01:19.296
and a junkyard
which we'll get back to later...

01:19.381 --> 01:22.008
- and then suddenly decide to dump you.
- How do you know?

01:22.050 --> 01:25.678
I've read every Nancy Drew mystery,
the one about the Amish country, twice.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.554
I know there's more to the story.

01:27.638 --> 01:30.140
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of all his stuff.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.934
- What stuff?
- Everything he gave me and touched.

01:33.018 --> 01:34.102
Everything he looked at.

01:34.186 --> 01:36.646
Will you just calm down
for just one second?

01:36.730 --> 01:38.523
He doesn't wanna be my boyfriend, fine.

01:38.606 --> 01:40.149
Okay, it will be fine, but...

01:40.233 --> 01:41.484
- What?
- Mine.

01:42.819 --> 01:45.321
- Is there someone else?
- No.

01:45.404 --> 01:47.364
- Is he moving?
- No.

01:47.406 --> 01:50.408
Is he dying?
Did his football team lose a game?

01:50.492 --> 01:52.410
- What?
- It's happened.

01:52.494 --> 01:55.997
- Did he try something?
- What?

01:56.081 --> 01:58.541
- Did he want to...
- What?

01:58.583 --> 02:00.960
Did he want to go faster than you?

02:01.085 --> 02:03.378
- God, no!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

02:03.462 --> 02:06.172
You're just not giving me
much to go off of here.

02:06.257 --> 02:08.425
That's your fancy dress
that I made for you.

02:08.508 --> 02:11.386
That I wore to a dance
that I went to with him.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.637
The sweater's brand-new.

02:13.722 --> 02:17.058
- He saw me in it yesterday and liked it.
- Then he's got good taste.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.393
He said it brought out the blue in my eyes.

02:19.435 --> 02:20.727
Then he's gay.

02:20.770 --> 02:23.105
- You're not funny and it goes.
- I'm a little funny.

02:23.189 --> 02:25.357
If you throw away everything
he saw you wear...

02:25.441 --> 02:28.235
you're gonna be walking around
in a towel.

02:28.402 --> 02:32.572
Colonel Clucker? Are you serious?
He has been with you since you were four.

02:32.655 --> 02:35.073
The first time Dean came over,
he picked it up.

02:35.158 --> 02:36.492
That's not the Colonel's fault.

02:36.576 --> 02:39.578
He was sitting, minding his own business,
and a guy picks him up.

02:39.662 --> 02:40.871
What's a stuffed bird to do?

02:40.955 --> 02:43.790
I don't want to joke about this, not now.

02:43.874 --> 02:46.501
Here, I don't want to look at that anymore.

02:47.085 --> 02:50.254
- I'll put it away.
- No, take it out of the house.

02:50.630 --> 02:54.425
Throw it in a dumpster, burn it,
I don't care. I want it gone.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.304
Someday when this is all in the past...

02:59.388 --> 03:01.765
you may be sorry
you don't have those things.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.892
I don't care!

03:03.976 --> 03:06.269
- Okay, fine. It's gone.
- Thank you.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.356
I'll take care of it, and you go to bed.
Get some rest.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.401
Maybe you'll feel more like talking
in the morning.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.486
Honey, good night.

03:20.490 --> 03:21.866
- Mom.
- Yeah.

03:22.284 --> 03:24.452
Far, far away from the house, okay?

03:24.536 --> 03:27.455
- Hey, it sleeps with the fishes.
- Thank you.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.907 --> 04:53.700
Mom, get up.

04:55.285 --> 04:58.663
- Rory, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I just want to get started.

04:58.746 --> 05:01.707
I listed all the things
we say we're gonna do on weekends...

05:01.791 --> 05:02.917
but when it comes around...

05:03.000 --> 05:05.752
you say they're too boring
to actually do on a weekend day.

05:05.836 --> 05:09.756
Then you say we'll do them during
the week which, of course, we never do.

05:10.090 --> 05:13.885
I think we should get them
all out of the way today once and for all.

05:14.093 --> 05:18.221
And to make it interesting,
we should come up with a reward system.

05:18.347 --> 05:20.807
So once we're done with everything
on the list...

05:20.891 --> 05:22.600
we could go get manicures.

05:22.768 --> 05:26.229
Or we could go to that Swiss place
for fondue for dinner...

05:26.313 --> 05:30.358
or we could stuff our purses
full of Sour Patch Kids and Milk Duds...

05:30.442 --> 05:33.277
and go see the Stars Hollow
elementary school production...

05:33.361 --> 05:35.696
of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

05:35.780 --> 05:37.489
- It's 6:00.
- I know.

05:37.573 --> 05:39.741
- On Saturday morning.
- That's right.

05:40.659 --> 05:42.410
It's 6:00 on Saturday morning!

05:42.452 --> 05:45.830
- Do you want to wear docks or sneakers?
- I want to wear slippers.

05:45.914 --> 05:48.583
- Up, please!
- Rory, my heart.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.794
- It is Saturday, the day of rest.
- Sunday is the day of rest.

05:52.879 --> 05:55.840
- No, Saturday is the day of pre-rest.
- Pre-rest?

05:55.923 --> 05:58.425
Yeah, so that way
when you actually get to Sunday...

05:58.509 --> 06:01.219
you're rested enough to enjoy your rest.

06:01.303 --> 06:02.929
That makes absolutely no sense.

06:03.013 --> 06:05.682
That's because it's 6:00
on Saturday morning.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.725
- Oh, jeez!
- Up, please!

06:07.976 --> 06:10.770
- You made a rhyme.
- I'll see you downstairs.

06:36.835 --> 06:40.379
- Hello. Did you rearrange the furniture?
- Yes.

06:40.463 --> 06:43.549
Good. I thought we were having
a problem with decorator elves.

06:43.633 --> 06:47.928
I was gonna have to call an exterminator
and tent the place. But it was just you.

06:48.012 --> 06:51.306
So was there any reason
that you suddenly felt the need...

06:51.348 --> 06:53.975
to move around large pieces of furniture
in the morning?

06:54.059 --> 06:58.146
- I was up. It was there.
- Okay, good thought process. Great.

06:59.022 --> 07:02.108
Now I noticed that
you didn't move the TV though.

07:02.191 --> 07:04.151
- It was too heavy.
- Right, okay.

07:04.569 --> 07:06.821
Well, I like this. This is good.

07:06.904 --> 07:10.448
Of course when the sofa faced the TV,
it was a little easier to watch.

07:10.532 --> 07:14.285
But this is good, too. It'll be like radio.

07:14.369 --> 07:17.955
- Are you ready to go?
- I am. Just one quick sec.

07:19.249 --> 07:21.334
Why don't you...
Could you put the pen down?

07:21.417 --> 07:22.876
I'm just finishing the list.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.587
Yes, I see. As much as I love your list...

07:25.671 --> 07:29.841
let's just finish this particular one
in a little while, okay?

07:30.300 --> 07:31.300
Okay.

07:32.260 --> 07:35.179
I'm concerned about you.
I wish you would talk to me.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.681
I don't want to deal with it right now.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.475
I can't deal with it right now.

07:39.559 --> 07:43.979
Fair enough. But listen,
I've had my heart broken before.

07:44.521 --> 07:46.105
It's really hard.

07:46.190 --> 07:49.776
It's hard for everyone,
so can I give you a little advice?

07:49.901 --> 07:51.027
Okay.

07:51.111 --> 07:53.905
I think what you really need
to do today is wallow.

07:54.405 --> 07:57.199
- Wallow?
- Yeah. Get back in your pajamas...

07:57.241 --> 08:00.702
go to bed, eat nothing but gallons
of ice cream and tons of pizza...

08:00.744 --> 08:04.622
don't take a shower, or shave your legs,
or put on any kind of makeup at all.

08:04.706 --> 08:07.875
Just sit in the dark, watch a sad movie
and have a good long cry...

08:07.918 --> 08:10.128
and just wallow. You need to wallow.

08:10.211 --> 08:13.547
- No.
- Rory, your first love is intense...

08:13.631 --> 08:16.383
and your first breakup even more intense.

08:16.425 --> 08:20.803
Shoving it away and ignoring it
while you make lists is not going to help.

08:20.929 --> 08:22.680
I don't want to wallow.

08:23.098 --> 08:25.183
- Try it for one day.
- No.

08:25.267 --> 08:27.227
One day of pizza and pajamas.

08:27.310 --> 08:31.647
I'll rent Love Story and The Champ,
An Affair to Remember, Ishtar.

08:31.731 --> 08:35.067
- I don't want to be that kind of girl.
- The kind who watches Ishtar?

08:35.150 --> 08:38.028
The girl who falls apart
because she doesn't have a boyfriend.

08:38.111 --> 08:39.571
That hardly applies to you.

08:39.655 --> 08:41.948
- It will, if I wallow.
- Not true.

08:42.282 --> 08:45.785
So I used to have a boyfriend
and now I don't.

08:45.869 --> 08:47.954
That's just the way it is.

08:48.037 --> 08:50.163
Sitting in the dark eating junk food...

08:50.248 --> 08:53.000
and not shaving my legs
isn't gonna change that, is it?

08:53.084 --> 08:55.794
- No.
- So I don't even want to go there.

08:56.337 --> 08:59.715
I have things to do.
I have school and Harvard to think about.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.590
Harvard's three years away.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.344
But now is the time to be preparing for it.

09:04.427 --> 09:07.096
I mean, Harvard is hard to get into...

09:07.138 --> 09:10.557
and I don't know why I even spend
my time thinking about anything else.

09:10.641 --> 09:12.100
Because you have a pulse.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.602
And you're not the president
of the audiovisual club.

09:14.686 --> 09:17.772
I'm 16. I have the rest of my life
to have a boyfriend.

09:17.856 --> 09:20.108
I should be keeping my eye
on the prize right now.

09:20.150 --> 09:22.443
- I admire your attitude.
- Thank you.

09:22.485 --> 09:25.779
So should we rent Old Yeller, too?
Or is it just a guy's crying movie?

09:25.863 --> 09:27.072
You're not listening to me.

09:27.156 --> 09:29.950
I am listening to you.
I just don't agree with you.

09:30.034 --> 09:32.619
I don't want to wallow,
and you can't make me.

09:32.703 --> 09:34.621
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

09:35.747 --> 09:37.999
- So that must be the list.
- Yes, it is.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.876
May I see it, please?

09:43.921 --> 09:46.423
- We do not need a garden hose.
- We don't have one.

09:46.507 --> 09:47.924
We don't have a garden either.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.968
But maybe if we have a hose,
we can grow one.

09:50.052 --> 09:51.678
- Could I see the pen for a sec?
- Why?

09:51.762 --> 09:53.388
Small adjustment.

10:00.895 --> 10:03.605
It's on the list.
Don't you have to do it if it's there?

10:03.689 --> 10:04.856
I am not going to wallow.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.734
But I put it after going
to the recycling center.

10:08.444 --> 10:10.946
What are these people doing up?
It's Saturday morning.

10:10.988 --> 10:13.156
- Some people like getting up early.
- You lie.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.074
- No, they do it voluntarily.
- Really?

10:15.158 --> 10:17.118
- Every day.
- Jump back.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.243
Excuse me?

10:18.328 --> 10:21.497
Kevin Bacon in Footloose,
reaction to the no-dancing-in-town rule...

10:21.539 --> 10:23.999
as revealed by Chris Penn,
Sean's brother, sage to all.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.502
You should have known
what they teach you in that damn school.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.506
- What?
- I can't go that way.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.341
- Why, we're going to Luke's.
- No.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.635
You pulled me out of bed at 6:00 a. M...

10:35.718 --> 10:38.637
and then you say no to Luke's?
Don't you know that's dangerous?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.389
- I can't go that way.
- Reason, please?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.558
- We'd have to go by Doose's market.
- So?

10:42.641 --> 10:45.602
- So we might run into...
- Oh, right.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.562
You don't know if he's working?

10:47.646 --> 10:50.064
I don't remember.
His weekend schedule changes a lot.

10:50.148 --> 10:51.524
We'll just take the long way.

10:51.566 --> 10:54.443
- No, we'd have to go by the school.
- There's no school today.

10:54.527 --> 10:57.446
On his days off,
he plays football there with his friends.

10:57.530 --> 10:59.448
- Well, what time?
- It varies.

11:00.115 --> 11:03.618
We'll just go down Peach, circle around...
You're shaking your head, why?

11:03.702 --> 11:04.994
Dean lives on Peach.

11:05.037 --> 11:06.746
Rory, honey, love of my life...

11:06.830 --> 11:10.082
you realize you've cut us off from Luke's
where the happy coffee is.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.584
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

11:16.213 --> 11:18.047
We'll figure something out.

11:18.424 --> 11:20.592
- Sorry.
- No, this is good.

11:20.884 --> 11:23.136
It's like G.I. Jane,
but we get to keep our hair.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.722
- I just couldn't.
- Honey, say no more.

11:25.805 --> 11:27.348
Think of this as an adventure.

11:27.432 --> 11:30.142
Two girls battling the elements,
desperate for survival.

11:30.226 --> 11:32.102
- Or coffee.
- Same thing.

11:32.770 --> 11:35.939
I bet you can tell a lot about people
from their garbage.

11:36.023 --> 11:39.692
Think about it. Trash is discarded aspects
of people's lives.

11:39.776 --> 11:42.528
It talks about their eating habits,
what they read...

11:42.612 --> 11:44.697
do they go to concerts,
are they responsible...

11:44.781 --> 11:46.574
do they pay their bills on time?

11:46.616 --> 11:49.994
You know that trash doesn't actually talk
unless it's on Sesame Street.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.411
I'm just trying to make a point.

11:51.495 --> 11:53.371
That going through garbage is interesting.

11:53.455 --> 11:55.581
- And educational.
- And stinky and a little nuts.

11:55.666 --> 11:58.793
There's nothing nuts about wanting
to know more about human nature.

11:58.877 --> 12:02.838
- Curiosity is how we grow.
- We need to get you out of this alley.

12:07.551 --> 12:10.470
- Who are all these people?
- It's the 6:00 a. m. Crowd.

12:10.554 --> 12:13.097
I officially recognize nobody in this place.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.560
- Coffee while you wait?
- Bless you.

12:18.103 --> 12:19.771
So Luke put you to work?

12:19.813 --> 12:22.565
I figured if I'm hanging around here
for a while...

12:22.649 --> 12:24.150
the least I could do is help out.

12:24.233 --> 12:27.235
So you're gonna be hanging around
for a while here?

12:27.278 --> 12:28.654
Yeah, I think so.

12:28.862 --> 12:31.072
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

12:31.823 --> 12:33.449
So where is Luke?

12:33.575 --> 12:36.869
We were kind of up late last night,
so I let him sleep in.

12:36.953 --> 12:38.496
Sleep in? Luke?

12:38.580 --> 12:41.123
Believe me, it wasn't easy
to get him to agree to it...

12:41.207 --> 12:45.460
but in the end, a little sweet talk,
a couple Excedrin PMs, he finally caved.

12:46.337 --> 12:48.463
- There's a seat over there.
- Great.

12:48.547 --> 12:50.965
- Go! I'll be over in a sec.
- Okay.

12:54.803 --> 12:57.388
I feel like everyone is staring at me.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.141
Yeah, because you've got a banana peel
stuck to your foot.

13:00.224 --> 13:01.975
- I do?
- I'm kidding.

13:02.852 --> 13:05.187
- Nobody's staring at you.
- They know.

13:05.270 --> 13:08.272
- They don't know.
- It's probably all around town by now.

13:08.315 --> 13:10.817
It just happened last night.
It's 6:00 in the morning.

13:10.901 --> 13:13.444
Everyone knows that I've been dumped.

13:14.404 --> 13:16.989
- Do you want to go home?
- No, we have a list.

13:17.073 --> 13:19.450
Okay. Great.
I'm gonna order us something.

13:19.533 --> 13:22.160
Any preferences?
Eggs, French toast, key to the dumpster?

13:22.202 --> 13:24.620
- I don't care.
- I'll be right back.

13:25.956 --> 13:29.584
Lorelai, what a nice surprise
so early in the morning.

13:29.668 --> 13:31.044
So how's things?

13:31.127 --> 13:32.419
You know, don't you?

13:32.503 --> 13:35.797
Yes, and I feel awful.
I feel completely responsible.

13:35.882 --> 13:36.882
You should.

13:36.966 --> 13:39.968
I got Dean that job,
and I certainly encouraged them.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.137
I felt they were so right together.

13:42.179 --> 13:44.597
Please don't say anything to Rory about it.

13:44.681 --> 13:46.849
She's concerned
about everybody finding out.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.351
Of course. Not a peep.

13:48.393 --> 13:51.228
- And spread the word, okay?
- Consider it done.

13:52.188 --> 13:54.231
Would you give the angel a hug for me?

13:54.315 --> 13:57.818
You don't have to say it's from me.
Just give her a hug.

13:57.902 --> 13:59.403
- Got it.
- Okay.

14:05.158 --> 14:07.201
Good morning, sleeping beauty.

14:07.285 --> 14:09.703
Rachel thought I looked a little tired.

14:09.746 --> 14:12.790
- No, it's good. You need a little break.
- I guess.

14:12.873 --> 14:14.040
You do.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.002
She seems pretty comfortable here?

14:17.044 --> 14:21.840
She always could just fit in places,
you know. It's a talent of hers.

14:24.050 --> 14:27.553
- She looks good in your apron.
- Yeah, can I get you anything?

14:28.888 --> 14:32.266
Do you think you can make
those crazy chocolate chip pancakes...

14:32.349 --> 14:34.350
and go extra heavy on the chocolate?

14:34.393 --> 14:36.394
Yeah, sure. Any special occasion?

14:36.436 --> 14:38.270
- Dean broke up with Rory.
- What?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.398
Quiet. She doesn't want anybody to know.

14:40.482 --> 14:43.651
I knew it. I knew that kid was trouble.

14:43.735 --> 14:46.028
Yes, you did. You knew it.
Pancakes, please.

14:46.070 --> 14:47.404
God, he's got a nerve.

14:47.446 --> 14:49.823
What does he think?
He's gonna do better than Rory?

14:49.907 --> 14:52.701
Is he crazy? Jeez. All right, forget it.

14:52.785 --> 14:56.997
Good riddance, adios, bienvenidos,
hasta la vista.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.623
Could we get off the Small World ride
and get cooking?

14:59.708 --> 15:03.002
- How is she?
- She's been dumped by her first boyfriend.

15:03.753 --> 15:06.505
Man, I swear I would love to...

15:07.298 --> 15:11.385
Okay, I'm gonna put some whipped cream
on the pancakes, too.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.387
Thank you, Luke.

15:13.470 --> 15:15.513
- Not a word, okay?
- I got it.

15:15.597 --> 15:17.974
I never liked him.
I don't know exactly what it was.

15:18.057 --> 15:20.767
Something about the shape
of his forehead...

15:20.852 --> 15:23.646
or his height or the floppy hairstyle.

15:23.729 --> 15:26.815
Actually, on reflection,
I think it was the floppy hairstyle.

15:26.899 --> 15:28.108
Good morning, Kirk.

15:28.150 --> 15:32.153
I want to express my apologies
for not voicing my concerns...

15:32.237 --> 15:35.656
about that floppy-haired jerk earlier,
because if I had...

15:35.740 --> 15:38.325
You know what, you need to leave now.

15:38.618 --> 15:40.703
I cannot go until you accept my apology.

15:40.786 --> 15:43.038
- I accept your apology.
- All right.

15:44.665 --> 15:47.042
- It will not happen again.
- Okay.

15:47.793 --> 15:49.085
Thank you.

15:49.669 --> 15:52.129
Honey, are you sure you don't want to...

15:52.213 --> 15:56.258
- Do not say wallow.
- Swallow your coffee before you eat?

15:56.467 --> 15:59.428
- I am fine.
- But if you could see the look on your face.

15:59.470 --> 16:02.681
It's the same look you had on your face
when you broke up with Max.

16:02.765 --> 16:05.142
Did wallowing help you get over him?

16:05.517 --> 16:08.352
I'm not saying wallowing
will help you get over Dean.

16:08.436 --> 16:10.437
It's part of the process.

16:10.605 --> 16:13.857
It's the mourning period.
It's a step, an important step.

16:13.941 --> 16:16.526
The only thing
that'll get you over somebody is time.

16:16.611 --> 16:18.696
How much time did it take you
to get over Max?

16:18.779 --> 16:21.489
- I'm not sure exactly.
- Approximately?

16:21.865 --> 16:23.783
- I didn't clock it.
- Ballpark figure?

16:23.867 --> 16:25.034
- A while.
- Be vaguer.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.410
Rory, come on.

16:26.495 --> 16:29.289
More coffee?
Pancakes are coming right up.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.957
- Anything else I can get you?
- No, thanks.

16:32.041 --> 16:35.710
I've got some strawberries back there.
You like strawberries, don't you?

16:35.795 --> 16:39.006
- I like strawberries but...
- I'm getting you strawberries.

16:40.757 --> 16:44.260
- You told him, didn't you?
- No. Miss Patty did.

16:44.636 --> 16:47.888
- Who told Miss Patty?
- I don't know, numerous sources.

16:52.184 --> 16:53.601
- Stop right there.
- What?

16:53.686 --> 16:55.062
- Where you going?
- To get coffee.

16:55.145 --> 16:56.145
- Wrong.
- Excuse me.

16:56.188 --> 16:58.022
- You're not going in.
- What are you saying?

16:58.106 --> 16:59.232
Turn around, bag boy.

16:59.316 --> 17:01.442
- Are you serious?
- You see a smile on this face?

17:01.526 --> 17:04.694
- No, but what's different about that?
- What's that supposed to mean?

17:04.738 --> 17:07.115
You're not exactly known
as the town crackup.

17:07.198 --> 17:08.490
So you're a smart guy now?

17:08.532 --> 17:09.700
What the hell are you doing?

17:09.784 --> 17:11.617
Exercising my right not to serve you.

17:11.702 --> 17:14.829
What are you talking about?
I'm not even inside yet.

17:14.872 --> 17:16.330
- Let go of me!
- You first!

17:16.373 --> 17:19.041
If you tell Miss Patty,
everybody in town's gonna know.

17:19.126 --> 17:21.502
People have their own lives and problems.

17:21.544 --> 17:26.006
I hardly think you and Dean breaking up
is the main thing on their minds.

17:26.549 --> 17:28.092
- Oh, my God!
- What?

17:29.468 --> 17:30.719
Oh, my God.

17:30.803 --> 17:33.388
Cut it out! Break it up!

17:33.514 --> 17:34.806
What are you doing?

17:34.890 --> 17:38.351
Back off! Come here.
What do you think you're doing?

17:38.435 --> 17:40.186
- He started it.
- By doing what?

17:40.228 --> 17:43.147
- He was coming in.
- Are you a lunatic! He's 16!

17:43.231 --> 17:44.523
What was I supposed to do?

17:44.565 --> 17:46.942
Stand in the street
and have a slap fight, of course.

17:47.026 --> 17:48.193
Come here.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.487
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

17:50.571 --> 17:54.157
Good. I don't know what got into Luke.
He's usually so...

17:54.241 --> 17:55.450
I have to go.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.785
Sure. Bye.

17:58.703 --> 18:02.122
- Get inside now. Inside. Now!
- He started it.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.469
- So where's that list?
- What?

18:16.553 --> 18:18.346
The list. We've got a lot to do today.

18:18.429 --> 18:20.263
Otherwise I'll be dragging your butt...

18:20.306 --> 18:22.641
out of bed
at 6:00 again tomorrow morning.

18:22.725 --> 18:24.726
So where do we start?

18:29.648 --> 18:32.108
We need a soap dish for the kitchen.

18:32.651 --> 18:34.444
A kitchen soap dish.

18:34.486 --> 18:37.405
Quite decadent, but what the hell?
Let's go.

18:40.491 --> 18:43.952
- That was a very successful outing for us.
- Yes, it was.

18:44.578 --> 18:47.163
We got everything
except for the brown extension cord.

18:47.247 --> 18:48.414
Which will be in on Tuesday.

18:48.457 --> 18:52.085
- So I think that qualifies as a check, too.
- Are you happy?

18:52.168 --> 18:54.253
I appreciate a job well done, yeah.

18:54.629 --> 18:58.215
I can't wait to try the toaster pizza.
It looks so gross...

18:58.299 --> 19:00.384
which is usually the mark
of a great junk food.

19:00.467 --> 19:01.634
- Beefaroni.
- Enough said.

19:01.677 --> 19:03.637
I'm gonna plug in
my new wall air freshener.

19:03.679 --> 19:05.889
Give me five minutes
and then come sniff my room.

19:05.972 --> 19:07.681
- Cheese or pepperoni?
- Whatever.

19:07.766 --> 19:09.392
Both. Good choice.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.688
Sugar, I just heard. Where is she?
Poor little thing.

19:14.772 --> 19:17.274
- Rory, sweetie!
- Come on.

19:17.358 --> 19:18.942
Is she outside?

19:20.694 --> 19:23.154
Babbette, I appreciate you
coming over like this...

19:23.238 --> 19:25.615
but Rory's not really
in a talking mood just now.

19:25.657 --> 19:27.283
- But I can help!
- I know.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.369
I can tell her how to go through
a lot of bad relationships...

19:30.453 --> 19:33.497
- to get to that really good one!
- It's very good advice.

19:33.581 --> 19:37.042
And I can tell her about all
the horrible men I've known in my day.

19:37.126 --> 19:41.046
Really truly awful men.
I was pushed out of a moving car once.

19:41.129 --> 19:43.631
- That's a peppy little anecdote.
- Let me tell her.

19:43.715 --> 19:46.717
I want you to tell her all that
but just not right now.

19:46.801 --> 19:48.177
Is she really bad?

19:49.178 --> 19:52.305
She'll be fine. Really.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.315
- They had some of our mail.
- Look.

20:51.109 --> 20:54.070
- 'Madeline's having a party. '
- I'm going to go.

20:54.195 --> 20:57.030
- You're going to a Chilton party?
- Yes, I am.

20:57.198 --> 21:00.159
Why don't you stay home
and read The Bell Jar? Same effect.

21:00.243 --> 21:03.621
I'll be going to school there
for the next two-and-a-half years.

21:03.704 --> 21:07.165
It wouldn't kill me to be social.
Right? What's wrong with that?

21:07.374 --> 21:08.500
Nothing.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.585
Okay, then it's settled.

21:11.753 --> 21:14.338
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Go ahead.

21:14.422 --> 21:16.382
Why don't you see
if Lane can come with you?

21:16.424 --> 21:18.926
If the socializing doesn't turn out
how you planned...

21:19.010 --> 21:20.344
you got a friendly face around.

21:20.428 --> 21:23.097
- Okay, good idea. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:23.138 --> 21:24.430
- Can I take the car?
- Yes.

21:24.473 --> 21:26.099
- Can I borrow something to wear?
- Yes.

21:26.183 --> 21:29.102
You gonna give in to anything
'cause you feel sorry for me?

21:29.144 --> 21:30.728
I'll make a list.

21:30.812 --> 21:32.521
- Here, hand me that blush.
- Okay.

21:32.605 --> 21:34.606
Am I all twisty back here?

21:35.274 --> 21:37.067
A little. Here.

21:39.361 --> 21:40.737
So how are you?

21:40.779 --> 21:42.155
I'm fine.

21:43.448 --> 21:44.865
How are you really?

21:45.033 --> 21:46.784
Life goes on, right?

21:47.160 --> 21:49.954
I saw Dean today,
I wasn't sure if I should tell you.

21:49.996 --> 21:51.288
Why not?

21:51.331 --> 21:55.751
- I wasn't sure you'd want to know.
- No, that's fine. What did he say?

21:56.127 --> 21:59.046
Nothing. He crossed the street
as soon as I saw him.

22:01.131 --> 22:04.967
But if it's any consolation,
he looked really sad.

22:05.010 --> 22:06.970
I don't want him to be sad.

22:07.011 --> 22:08.887
Are you sure you wanna go out tonight?

22:08.972 --> 22:11.015
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

22:11.098 --> 22:14.059
Because you just broke up.
I'd be perfectly fine...

22:14.143 --> 22:18.730
to just hang out here and listen to music,
talk, not talk, whatever.

22:18.981 --> 22:21.024
No, I am not hanging out.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.442
We're going to this party.

22:23.485 --> 22:26.946
It's gonna be great.
I don't want to dwell on this. That's final.

22:26.988 --> 22:31.325
Don't argue with her, or you'll find yourself
the proud owner of three garden weasels.

22:31.409 --> 22:33.535
Three, 'cause one's just not enough.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.078
- Here, turn around.
- Why?

22:35.162 --> 22:37.705
Fourteen hours of labor, that's why.

22:38.749 --> 22:40.000
And hair.

22:42.752 --> 22:43.752
What is this?

22:43.836 --> 22:46.338
I thought it would go with your dress,
and it does.

22:46.422 --> 22:48.590
- It's pretty.
- It's really pretty.

22:48.674 --> 22:51.092
Here is the phone and some mad money.

22:51.176 --> 22:54.262
If you think you're not
gonna be home before 12:00, you call me.

22:54.346 --> 22:55.680
We'll be back by 12:00.

22:55.764 --> 22:57.515
- Call me.
- Sorry.

23:01.603 --> 23:03.104
The cornstarch.

23:03.187 --> 23:04.146
What?

23:05.481 --> 23:08.650
The cornstarch.
The first time Dean kissed me...

23:08.692 --> 23:11.527
I forgot to put it with the other things.
I'll throw it out.

23:11.570 --> 23:14.405
Why don't you let me do that?
You guys get going, okay?

23:14.489 --> 23:17.032
Okay, bye. Have fun.

23:17.909 --> 23:20.119
Look in somebody's sock drawer.

23:20.203 --> 23:23.372
Rich people have hilarious sock drawers.
Be good.

24:09.122 --> 24:11.374
- Lorelai, hey.
- I wanted to ask you if...

24:11.416 --> 24:14.210
- Sure, whatever.
- Sookie, hello?

24:18.506 --> 24:19.923
Hi. How are you?

24:19.965 --> 24:22.217
Good, I'm fine.
How's that x-ray vision coming?

24:22.259 --> 24:23.385
Jackson's inside.

24:23.468 --> 24:26.554
- Is he doing something dirty?
- He's making me dinner.

24:26.596 --> 24:28.931
- That's so nice.
- Yeah, it is.

24:28.973 --> 24:31.350
It really is, it's sweet. I'm just...

24:31.434 --> 24:33.310
- Do you hear something?
- Like what?

24:33.394 --> 24:36.980
Like someone using the wrong size pan
to sweat the onions in.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.816
No, nothing like that.

24:39.900 --> 24:43.319
Okay, maybe I'm hearing things.
So, hi, how are you?

24:43.403 --> 24:45.446
Fine. So I wanted to see...

24:45.530 --> 24:47.782
Could you peek inside the kitchen
and tell me...

24:47.824 --> 24:50.868
if the orange Le Creuset
is on the far left burner.

24:51.452 --> 24:53.286
Why don't you just go in there?

24:53.329 --> 24:56.456
I would, but Jackson kicked me out.

24:56.540 --> 24:57.582
He did.

24:57.666 --> 25:00.126
He won't let me back in there.
It's driving me crazy.

25:00.210 --> 25:03.296
Maybe he just wants you to relax.
I wouldn't mind that, either.

25:03.380 --> 25:06.424
Just take a peek for me, will you?
Tell him you want some water.

25:06.466 --> 25:09.176
And here. Take a picture for me.

25:09.635 --> 25:12.137
Sookie, I'm not spying on Jackson.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.931
What if he's using the wrong spoon
in the wrong sauce?

25:14.973 --> 25:17.808
- Then the world as we know will end.
- I have to go in there.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.435
You stay right where you are.

25:19.478 --> 25:21.312
You're being unreasonable.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.939
When a person offers
to make another person dinner...

25:24.023 --> 25:27.275
because this person is a chef
and is always cooking for others...

25:27.318 --> 25:29.611
that is what happens to be a nice gesture.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.488
And when that person
accepts the first person's offer...

25:32.573 --> 25:35.575
that means that the first person,
the one who offered to cook...

25:35.659 --> 25:38.995
would actually be doing the cooking,
while the other person relaxed...

25:39.037 --> 25:41.080
had some wine,
and stayed out of the kitchen!

25:41.164 --> 25:43.791
I wasn't cooking. I was suggesting.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.711
You suggested the ladle
right out of my hand four times!

25:47.795 --> 25:50.297
I had to skim the top of the sauce or it...

25:50.381 --> 25:52.924
Damn it, Sookie,
this is supposed to be romantic!

25:53.008 --> 25:55.260
- It is!
- Stay out of here.

25:55.343 --> 25:58.554
I am cooking this meal alone.
I'm also cleaning up alone.

25:58.638 --> 26:00.139
- No.
- Yes.

26:00.181 --> 26:03.183
But you don't know
how to load my dishwasher. I've a system.

26:03.226 --> 26:04.685
I'll wing it.

26:04.769 --> 26:08.856
There's a diagram in the pantry!
Use it! I'm begging you.

26:08.939 --> 26:12.358
I'm doing two loads just because I can!

26:12.442 --> 26:15.361
Honey, try to sit down and relax.
It's nice what he's doing.

26:15.403 --> 26:18.822
I know, you're right. It is nice.

26:18.865 --> 26:20.741
Okay. All right.

26:21.492 --> 26:25.579
I'm sitting. I'm relaxing.
I'm focusing on you.

26:25.663 --> 26:28.415
Good. Actually, I wanted
to ask you a favor.

26:28.498 --> 26:31.167
- What?
- Could I take your car for a little while?

26:31.209 --> 26:33.794
Rory's got mine,
and there's something I want to do.

26:33.878 --> 26:35.504
Yeah, of course.

26:36.214 --> 26:39.842
- What's so important?
- I'll tell you later.

26:39.884 --> 26:41.760
It sounds so serious.

26:41.844 --> 26:43.845
I'll have it back to you as soon as I can.

26:43.887 --> 26:47.348
- Take your time. I'm in for the night.
- Okay. Bye, hon.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.354
What happened? What did you do?

27:18.085 --> 27:19.669
Lorelai, what...

27:19.753 --> 27:21.754
Rory and Dean broke up.

27:23.006 --> 27:24.674
I'm sorry.

27:24.758 --> 27:28.344
Rory and Dean broke up,
and she won't wallow.

27:28.428 --> 27:30.763
And I told her that she should wallow...

27:30.847 --> 27:34.266
because that's supposed
to help you get through the pain...

27:34.350 --> 27:37.477
and then you can accept it,
and get over somebody...

27:37.561 --> 27:39.437
and you can move on with your life.

27:39.479 --> 27:44.066
And then she asked me
how long it was before I got over you.

27:44.109 --> 27:48.070
And I didn't know what to say
because I can't lie to her.

27:48.154 --> 27:50.948
I realized that if I gave her
any time frame at all...

27:51.032 --> 27:54.076
that I would be lying
because I'm not over you.

27:54.159 --> 27:57.078
And I don't know
how long it will be before I am.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.456
Who am I to teach her about healing,
moving on, and breakups?

28:00.498 --> 28:04.126
I might as well be teaching her
to eat fire or swallow a sword...

28:04.210 --> 28:07.629
or put her legs behind her head
because at least that's a trade.

28:07.713 --> 28:11.966
I mean, the first two. I don't know
about putting the legs behind your head.

28:12.051 --> 28:15.387
But the point is
that I'm an idiot, and I'm a hypocrite.

28:15.470 --> 28:17.638
And I really...

28:18.682 --> 28:19.974
miss you.

28:23.644 --> 28:27.105
- Do you want to come in?
- Yes. Please.

28:39.450 --> 28:42.619
This is unbelievable.
My wedding won't be this big.

28:43.079 --> 28:45.748
This is amazing! People live here?

28:45.831 --> 28:47.374
This is Madeline's house.

28:47.458 --> 28:50.168
Is this what
your grandparents' house looks like?

28:50.252 --> 28:53.671
No. I mean, it's big,
but it's not this Hearst Castle-y.

28:53.755 --> 28:57.383
There should be a map or a tour guide
or Robin Leach or something.

28:57.467 --> 29:00.719
- Lane, thanks for coming with me.
- Anytime.

29:01.345 --> 29:04.222
- My God, there's a pool table.
- And a deejay.

29:04.515 --> 29:07.100
It's like a teenage Sodom and Gomorrah.

29:10.103 --> 29:11.854
You came!

29:12.522 --> 29:13.939
Who's watching the farm?

29:14.023 --> 29:17.317
- Madeline, your house is beautiful.
- Thanks, it's my stepfather's.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.777
So, where is he?

29:18.861 --> 29:22.948
- My stepfather? He's in Japan.
- Not your stepfather. Prince Charming.

29:23.032 --> 29:26.576
He didn't come.
His white horse was in the shop.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.661
You guys didn't break up, did you?

29:28.703 --> 29:31.205
- Hi, I'm Lane.
- As in, walk down a?

29:31.289 --> 29:33.541
- Yes, exactly.
- Hi, I'm Madeline.

29:33.625 --> 29:36.419
So when does
the tour of the pool house start?

29:36.502 --> 29:38.503
You've seen the pool house before.

29:38.546 --> 29:41.298
But they haven't seen it at night, right?

29:43.091 --> 29:45.217
Madeline, you are not confused.

29:45.302 --> 29:47.929
Think, process, focus.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.349
Bye.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.685
- Later, Paris.
- No glove, no love.

29:54.727 --> 29:55.978
Lovely.

29:57.646 --> 30:00.565
- I didn't think you were a party girl.
- I'm not usually.

30:00.607 --> 30:03.401
But I thought I might come by
and check it out.

30:03.443 --> 30:06.028
It's the same exact people
we see every day at school...

30:06.112 --> 30:08.405
except now we get to see them dance.

30:08.448 --> 30:10.574
So where is your boyfriend?

30:10.783 --> 30:12.367
We broke up.

30:14.537 --> 30:17.039
At least you had a boyfriend for a while.

30:17.081 --> 30:20.125
Do you know which way
will lead us to some soda?

30:20.208 --> 30:22.418
Keep up because I'm not turning around.

30:23.044 --> 30:26.463
- You didn't exaggerate.
- Paris needs no embellishment.

30:31.802 --> 30:33.303
All of this soda is French.

30:33.387 --> 30:37.098
Madeline's mother has a French fetish.
She's obsessed with all things French.

30:37.140 --> 30:40.309
French wine, French food, French water,
French cellulite products.

30:40.393 --> 30:43.604
- Why won't you answer me?
- Because you didn't say 'please. '

30:43.646 --> 30:45.731
Can we do this later?
There's a party going on.

30:45.815 --> 30:48.776
Tell me what you were doing
locked in the bathroom with Austin.

30:48.818 --> 30:50.486
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

30:50.569 --> 30:51.778
- Yes.
- No.

30:51.820 --> 30:55.323
Why don't you tell me what I was doing,
since you seem to know everything.

30:55.407 --> 30:57.742
- You are my girlfriend.
- Now he is a caveman.

30:57.784 --> 31:00.745
What are you gonna do?
Knock me on my head with a club...

31:00.787 --> 31:03.456
and then drag me back to your Porsche?

31:03.790 --> 31:05.374
Summer, please.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.543
Good song.

31:14.508 --> 31:17.010
I just love that Summer, don't you?

31:18.011 --> 31:19.345
9:45.

31:19.554 --> 31:23.807
- Why do you keep checking your watch?
- My mom says I have to stay till 10:30.

31:25.309 --> 31:26.476
Why would she care?

31:26.560 --> 31:28.728
She thinks
I'm not enough of a people person.

31:28.812 --> 31:30.938
- Shocking?
- I'm floored.

31:32.274 --> 31:34.108
I doubt highly that Madame Curie...

31:34.150 --> 31:36.777
was voted 'most likely
to dress like Jennifer Lopez. '

31:36.820 --> 31:39.113
- You want to be a scientist?
- Cancer research.

31:39.155 --> 31:40.823
- Cool.
- Yeah.

31:41.157 --> 31:42.700
- Oh, no.
- What?

31:42.783 --> 31:45.410
It just figures that
the only Korean boy at this party...

31:45.494 --> 31:47.495
has his Korean-girl radar turned on.

31:48.789 --> 31:51.791
- I'm Henry.
- I'm Lane. This is Rory and Paris.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.543
- We've met.
- Hi, Paris.

31:53.626 --> 31:57.337
- So would you like to dance?
- We're talking here.

31:57.422 --> 32:00.341
Yeah, but, I mean, one dance?

32:00.424 --> 32:03.051
You can put the conversation on hold
for one dance.

32:03.135 --> 32:05.428
Unless this is
a Mid-East Peace Talk conversation.

32:05.512 --> 32:08.473
- One dance.
- A short one. No crazy dance mixes.

32:08.557 --> 32:10.642
- Okay.
- Thank you.

32:12.227 --> 32:14.520
If I'm not back in one dance,
you're coming down...

32:14.604 --> 32:17.648
with a really bad case of anything
that means we have to go home.

32:17.690 --> 32:21.068
- Is it getting warm in here, or is it me?
- Thank you.

32:23.362 --> 32:26.823
Unbelievable. She's here
five minutes, she has a date.

32:26.865 --> 32:31.285
I've been going to this school 9 years,
and I'm the French-soda monitor.

33:11.739 --> 33:14.741
Just in case this comes up later,
I did not come here for this.

33:14.825 --> 33:16.326
Okay, got it.

33:20.288 --> 33:23.749
- This is crazy!
- No, it is. It's nuts.

33:23.791 --> 33:26.460
I don't see you for months,
and then all of a sudden...

33:26.544 --> 33:27.753
Ding-dong, Avon lady.

33:27.837 --> 33:29.880
- It's insane.
- Completely.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.674
You do that so good.

33:33.759 --> 33:36.594
- We got to get a grip.
- I thought that's what we're doing.

33:36.636 --> 33:39.305
You're gonna sit over there on that couch.

33:39.848 --> 33:42.809
And I'm gonna sit over here on this chair...

33:43.518 --> 33:44.977
far away from the couch.

33:45.061 --> 33:48.272
And I'm gonna put this table
right in between us...

33:48.314 --> 33:51.483
just like that. Good, okay.

33:51.942 --> 33:55.611
And we're gonna sit here
and talk about this calmly.

33:56.112 --> 33:57.529
Sounds good.

33:58.573 --> 34:00.324
- How you been?
- Really good.

34:00.408 --> 34:02.409
- You look really good.
- So do you.

34:02.452 --> 34:05.204
- I missed you.
- I'm glad.

34:05.454 --> 34:09.415
Otherwise that greeting there
would have been a little inappropriate.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.585
Actually, I've been
thinking about us lately.

34:12.627 --> 34:13.627
You have?

34:13.753 --> 34:15.087
- Haven't you?
- No.

34:15.130 --> 34:18.299
- I haven't given it any thought at all.
- I'm flattered.

34:18.382 --> 34:21.092
I needed not to give it any thought...

34:21.260 --> 34:24.638
otherwise I would give it
too much thought and that would be hard.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.514
So I just didn't deal.

34:27.141 --> 34:30.185
- Like mother, like daughter, I guess.
- I understand.

34:30.268 --> 34:33.978
With all the thought you've been giving,
have you come up with any solutions?

34:34.063 --> 34:37.984
No. You're still Rory's mother,
and I'm still her teacher.

34:38.317 --> 34:40.944
And we're still us. I got nothing.

34:43.656 --> 34:46.491
- So nothing's changed?
- Nothing's changed.

34:47.284 --> 34:50.328
I guess my coming here
was probably a bad idea.

34:50.495 --> 34:51.829
Probably.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.500
Screw this!

35:16.560 --> 35:20.271
- Am I sick yet?
- Not yet. It might just be allergies.

35:20.355 --> 35:21.856
Keep me posted.

35:30.615 --> 35:32.616
My watch stopped. What time is it?

35:32.700 --> 35:34.701
- It's 10:35.
- Yes! Bye.

35:57.014 --> 35:58.348
Tristan, stop it.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.642
You're making me chase you
around the whole party.

36:00.725 --> 36:01.767
Just trying to have fun.

36:01.851 --> 36:04.728
You won't talk to me or dance.
Why did you even come with me?

36:04.771 --> 36:06.272
Stop yelling.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.816
Summer, please, can we just go?

36:08.899 --> 36:11.526
- Please.
- No. I'm sick of fighting with you.

36:11.610 --> 36:14.404
I'm sick of hearing 20 times a day,
'You're my girlfriend. '

36:14.446 --> 36:17.532
Could we do this where
a roomful of people aren't staring at us?

36:17.616 --> 36:19.701
I think we should break up.

36:20.201 --> 36:23.745
- I want to go outside and talk about this.
- Then go. Bye.

36:24.580 --> 36:26.164
Summer, come on!

36:34.256 --> 36:36.508
- I have a major problem.
- What?

36:36.591 --> 36:38.676
Henry, the guy I have been dancing with.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.762
Okay, he's really good in school.
He's gonna be a doctor.

36:41.846 --> 36:43.097
Pediatrician, to be exact.

36:43.139 --> 36:45.766
His parents are extremely involved
in their local church.

36:45.850 --> 36:47.601
He himself helps out with Sunday school.

36:47.685 --> 36:50.020
He speaks Korean fluently,
he respects his parents.

36:50.103 --> 36:54.231
And he's also really cute, very funny,
and surprisingly interesting.

36:54.274 --> 36:57.610
Lane, I'm sorry, but I'm totally failing
to see the problem here.

36:57.652 --> 37:00.029
I'm falling for a guy
my parents would approve of!

37:00.113 --> 37:03.491
They'd love him! They'd go crazy!
There'd be dancing in the Kim house!

37:03.574 --> 37:05.033
- Dancing!
- Really?

37:05.117 --> 37:08.578
Followed by a lot of praying.
But initially, there'd be dancing.

37:08.662 --> 37:12.373
This is horrible. It can't happen.
I have to stop it. We need to go.

37:12.999 --> 37:15.459
No, now. You need
to grab your stuff, we got to go.

37:15.543 --> 37:17.377
Okay. Whatever you say.

37:17.462 --> 37:19.296
- Hey!
- Henry, hi!

37:19.380 --> 37:21.506
Sorry, I've been
monopolizing Lane all night.

37:21.590 --> 37:25.468
No, that's okay. I've had her for 15 years.
I'm actually a little sick of her.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.596
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

37:27.971 --> 37:29.847
- We should go.
- You're going?

37:29.931 --> 37:33.350
Yeah, I have to get home.
I have a very strict mother.

37:33.434 --> 37:36.311
Sorry about that. You couldn't even stay
for one more dance?

37:36.354 --> 37:37.438
- I don't think...
- Yes.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.105
- Excuse me?
- One dance would be fine.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.399
Great.

37:40.482 --> 37:41.941
I'll be back!

37:43.944 --> 37:46.738
I certainly did not come over here for that.

37:47.239 --> 37:48.448
I know.

37:52.493 --> 37:54.828
You are a wonderful man.

37:55.871 --> 37:57.122
I know.

38:01.335 --> 38:03.003
What happens now?

38:04.588 --> 38:06.089
I don't know.

38:08.299 --> 38:11.009
It's late. I have to get Sookie's car back.

38:11.052 --> 38:12.928
Wait a second.

38:13.971 --> 38:17.682
So this is it? You leave,
and we forget this ever happened?

38:20.018 --> 38:21.144
No.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.146
Then what?

38:23.230 --> 38:25.857
I leave, and we go on with our lives...

38:25.940 --> 38:30.193
and then at some point
we buy some soup.

38:31.237 --> 38:33.655
- What? Soup is good food.
- Stop.

38:33.989 --> 38:38.076
I don't want to leave here
and forget this ever happened.

38:39.911 --> 38:43.872
I want to think of a solution
that will make everything better.

38:43.957 --> 38:46.709
And I've been racking my brain for an idea.

38:46.751 --> 38:49.753
Hence the babbling
about soup being good food.

38:50.796 --> 38:53.048
But I can't think of anything.

38:55.217 --> 38:57.177
I think we should talk.

38:58.053 --> 38:59.971
- What?
- On the phone.

39:00.388 --> 39:03.223
You and me, about us, on a regular basis.

39:05.393 --> 39:08.812
We're not gonna solve this thing
away from each other.

39:08.896 --> 39:10.188
No, we're not.

39:10.230 --> 39:12.565
And obviously,
we are not gonna solve this...

39:12.649 --> 39:15.568
by not staying away from each other.

39:15.777 --> 39:18.029
But we'll burn more calories.

39:20.657 --> 39:22.992
- I want to solve this.
- So do I.

39:23.701 --> 39:25.202
So we'll talk?

39:26.495 --> 39:27.871
We'll talk.

39:33.210 --> 39:37.547
- I thought we were supposed to be talking.
- There's plenty of time for talk.

39:44.637 --> 39:45.971
Sorry.

39:46.930 --> 39:48.264
No problem.

39:48.307 --> 39:49.641
I'm sorry.

39:50.642 --> 39:53.102
- About what?
- About you and Summer.

39:53.436 --> 39:55.771
I don't want to talk about Summer.

39:56.314 --> 39:58.774
How did you do on that biology test?

40:00.359 --> 40:01.443
What?

40:01.944 --> 40:04.404
The test. It was hard, wasn't it?

40:04.905 --> 40:06.573
Yeah, it was hard.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.242
I got a B plus.

40:09.743 --> 40:12.620
- What are you doing?
- Talking about the test.

40:12.662 --> 40:13.704
Why?

40:13.788 --> 40:16.415
You said you didn't want
to talk about Summer.

40:16.499 --> 40:17.833
I don't.

40:18.292 --> 40:20.460
Okay, so I moved to biology.

40:20.878 --> 40:23.088
Sorry, did you want to talk about Spanish?

40:23.130 --> 40:24.756
You just loved it, didn't you?

40:24.840 --> 40:27.634
- Loved what?
- Seeing me nailed like that.

40:27.801 --> 40:30.928
- It must have been a great moment.
- Not really.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.556
You loved it, she loved it,
everybody loved it.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.266
I did not love it.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.316
- I really liked her, too.
- Yeah, I know.

40:47.986 --> 40:50.321
So where's your boyfriend tonight?

40:50.363 --> 40:53.365
He's not my boyfriend anymore.

40:54.492 --> 40:56.827
- Why not?
- He didn't want to be.

40:59.204 --> 41:00.413
Idiot.

41:01.832 --> 41:03.249
So is Summer.

41:05.418 --> 41:07.586
You think you'll get back together?

41:07.670 --> 41:10.130
He was pretty set in his decision.

41:11.340 --> 41:13.633
- When did it happen?
- Yesterday.

41:13.676 --> 41:14.760
Wow.

41:15.010 --> 41:17.553
It was our three-month anniversary.

41:18.347 --> 41:21.016
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does suck.

41:23.226 --> 41:25.352
Do you think you guys will?

41:26.646 --> 41:28.939
- No.
- So, no?

41:30.566 --> 41:31.650
No.

41:36.655 --> 41:39.866
I'm sorry I gave you
such a hard time for a while.

41:40.075 --> 41:42.535
- That's okay.
- It is?

41:42.577 --> 41:44.954
No, but you're sad.

41:48.374 --> 41:49.750
I am sorry.

41:50.334 --> 41:52.210
I accept your apology.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.881
Man, it's a great party?

41:56.923 --> 41:58.424
Yeah, not bad.

41:59.259 --> 42:02.261
It gave me a chance
to catch up on my reading.

42:03.971 --> 42:06.681
You are very odd, you know that?

42:07.725 --> 42:09.059
Thank you.

42:10.394 --> 42:11.937
You're welcome.

42:26.450 --> 42:30.203
I'm sorry. What did I do?
Did I bite your lip or something?

42:30.412 --> 42:33.581
No, it's not you. I just have to go.

42:41.714 --> 42:44.216
- We have to go.
- Rory, are you okay?

42:44.508 --> 42:46.718
- I have to go.
- Wait, can I get your number?

42:46.760 --> 42:49.345
Last name's Kim.
We're the only ones in Stars Hollow.

42:49.429 --> 42:52.598
I can't believe I just gave my number
to a potential Korean doctor.

43:06.111 --> 43:08.071
I'm ready to wallow now.

43:33.135 --> 43:36.930
Hey, Joe, it's Lorelai.
I need a pizza with everything, okay?

43:37.640 --> 43:38.807
Thanks.
