I got a shared ride?
God damn it.

04:26.713 --> 04:28.630
Man:

04:28.630 --> 04:31.338
And she's screaming
at me because I left

04:31.338 --> 04:33.380
That's crazy.
I swear to God.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.380
Hi.
Who was there?

04:35.380 --> 04:38.171
I was there. Exactly.
Sorry, I didn't
realize it was...

04:38.171 --> 04:39.922
I swear to God,
I'm getting crazy.
I'm turning into--

04:39.922 --> 04:43.213

04:50.880 --> 04:53.338
I'm really feeling

04:53.338 --> 04:55.421
And no, you can't
bring her either,

appreciative of the fact

04:57.254 --> 04:59.254
that I was telling her
that her titty was out that day.

04:59.254 --> 05:00.922
She was walking around
with her head up her ass,

05:00.922 --> 05:02.880
and she's unappreciative
of my friendship.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.380
I you aren't appreciative
of my friendship,

05:04.380 --> 05:06.505

Simple as that.

How's it going?
Uh, fine. You?

06:06.004 --> 06:08.630
Really good, actually.
I just started writing
for Vice.

06:08.630 --> 06:10.463
Oh, mazel tov.
That's great.

06:10.463 --> 06:11.880
It's so funny
you say that.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.254
I'm, like, literally
writing a story about
ultra-Orthodox Jews

06:14.254 --> 06:15.838
who have defected
from their community.

06:15.838 --> 06:18.254
Cool. Do they know you're
doing a story about 'em?

So, I don't have

but I have all
of the other stuff.
All right.

06:26.463 --> 06:30.963
Cool. I actually went
to this thing last night
called a Chulent.

06:30.963 --> 06:33.963
It's like this weekly
meeting for ex-Hasids

06:33.963 --> 06:37.672
who have, like, defected
from the community.
Super fascinating.

06:37.672 --> 06:39.630
Let me just grab that.
I'm just gonna...

06:39.630 --> 06:41.004
Yeah. Sorry.
It's okay.

06:41.004 --> 06:44.213
Yeah, they're
like on the fringes
of the fringes of society.

06:44.213 --> 06:46.838
Like, their families
have completely severed
ties with them,

06:46.838 --> 06:51.254
they have no secular education,
and barely speak English
when they leave.

06:51.254 --> 06:52.713
It's super sad.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.672
Yeah, that's rough.
You gonna take those two?

06:54.672 --> 06:57.505
Yup, these two.
All right, that's $100
coming my way.

06:57.505 --> 06:58.963

Good Shabbos.

08:11.755 --> 08:13.421
I don't touch women.
I'm kidding.

08:13.421 --> 08:15.755
Oh. Okay.
Shabbos.

08:20.755 --> 08:21.922

Yeah, that's me, man.
Hop in.

08:40.463 --> 08:42.505
How's it going, man?

I recognized your voice.

09:08.672 --> 09:10.838
I didn't even notice
on the app.

09:10.838 --> 09:12.630
Your, uh...
you cut your hair, man.

09:12.630 --> 09:15.588
Yeah, man. I cut my hair,
cleaned up a little bit,

09:15.588 --> 09:18.463
got this button-down shirt,
got this car,

09:18.463 --> 09:21.546
MP3 player, got this
air-freshener thingy.

09:21.546 --> 09:23.505
It's a whole new me, man.
How about you?

09:23.505 --> 09:26.338
I'm okay.
Someone locked
their bike to mine,

09:26.338 --> 09:27.672
so I can't get my bike.
Ah.

09:27.672 --> 09:29.546
I should be taking
the subway or walking,

09:29.546 --> 09:31.922
but I thought I'd treat
myself this time.

09:31.922 --> 09:34.129
Yeah, man. You gotta
treat yourself, dude.

09:34.129 --> 09:37.171
The world is crazy.
Yeah, it really is.

09:37.171 --> 09:41.463
Really fucking nuts.
You know, some dude
I just picked up from JFK,

09:41.463 --> 09:44.588
he sincerely just asked me
if ISIS had tried to recruit me.

09:44.588 --> 09:46.380
Ooh! Are you serious?
Do you believe that?

09:46.380 --> 09:50.171
Yeah.
What he doesn't know is that
ISIS would be lucky to have you.

09:50.171 --> 09:52.838
You're the guy
who's looking out
for the nut allergy.

09:52.838 --> 09:55.171
Yeah, man.
One of those crazy fucks

09:55.171 --> 09:58.046
is bound to have
a nut allergy, right?
Most definitely.

10:02.505 --> 10:03.797
Oh shit.

10:03.797 --> 10:06.213
You wanna get down
on this, man?
Yeah.

10:23.296 --> 10:25.046
No, don't take any photos.
Don't take any photos.

10:25.046 --> 10:26.254
No?
You can't take photos. No.

10:26.254 --> 10:28.129
Okay. Why? I thought--

10:28.129 --> 10:30.338
I thought all these people
had already left.
No.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.380
No, no, no.
A lot of these people
are still in.

10:32.380 --> 10:35.797

she's still married.

10:35.797 --> 10:37.838
Anja: Okay.
Baruch:
If her husband finds out,

10:37.838 --> 10:39.922
you know, she'll be
in a lot of trouble.

10:39.922 --> 10:41.254
Gotcha. Yeah.

10:41.254 --> 10:44.088
What's the deal with the guy
in the corner? Is he--

10:44.088 --> 10:45.213
Baruch: That guy?
Anja: Yeah.

10:45.213 --> 10:46.588
Baruch:
Yeah, he's got nine kids.

10:46.588 --> 10:49.421
After having
Shabbos dinner
with his wife and family,

10:49.421 --> 10:52.088
he comes here
to hang out with--
with friends.

10:52.088 --> 10:53.088
Okay.

10:55.129 --> 10:58.088
Uh, can I ask you a question?

10:58.088 --> 11:01.296
Is it true what they say
about the hole in the sheet?

11:03.129 --> 11:05.546
No. No. No.
No. Okay.

11:09.046 --> 11:12.463
Hey, uh, would you--
would you mind taking
a selfie with me?

11:13.630 --> 11:14.838

Yeah, just the two of us.

Dude, after taking
a second Capri Sun?

15:06.505 --> 15:08.838
That's cold, man.
Man: Well, I'm sorry
about the Capri Sun,

15:08.838 --> 15:11.588
but I signed up
for a individual ride.
No, my dude.

15:11.588 --> 15:13.963
No. I'm sorry
about the Capri Sun.

15:13.963 --> 15:16.296
Yeah, we're all sorry
about the Capri Sun.

15:16.296 --> 15:17.922
Yeah, man.
This is bullshit.

15:17.922 --> 15:19.797
I'm just saying
if you don't give
a shit about America,

15:19.797 --> 15:21.922

That's all I'm saying.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.088
Dodi:
Okay, I understand
what you're saying, okay?

15:24.088 --> 15:26.338
He's a real estate guy,
he understands business,

15:26.338 --> 15:29.797

that real estate people
like me are happy, okay?

15:29.797 --> 15:31.380
Yeah. No, I--
you're totally right.

15:31.380 --> 15:35.546
