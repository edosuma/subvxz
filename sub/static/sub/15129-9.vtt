01:59.495 --> 02:01.829
I know that feeling.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.467
Mack?

02:05.501 --> 02:07.185
That's right.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.054
You're dead.

02:09.104 --> 02:10.672
No, I mean, really, <i>really</i> dead.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.657
I went to your service months ago.

02:12.692 --> 02:14.643
And I appreciated you being there.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.027
Meant a lot.

02:16.062 --> 02:18.480
You're one of the finest
surgeons I ever trained.

02:19.377 --> 02:20.632
Whatcha doing here, Mack?

02:21.959 --> 02:23.518
(chuckles) Body's been in the morgue,
donated to science.

02:23.536 --> 02:24.653
They brought me over today.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.638
Oh, right. That new group of med students.

02:26.672 --> 02:30.041
There's this one... 26, great rack,

02:30.076 --> 02:31.826
little horn-rimmed glasses.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.746
She's up to her elbows
in my bowels right now.

02:34.797 --> 02:35.881
You're down there, too?

02:35.915 --> 02:38.383
Uh, no. No, I'm upstairs.

02:38.417 --> 02:39.834
Huh? I'm in a coma.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.002
(inhales sharply) Oh.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.254
Dawn pulled the plug this morning.

02:42.305 --> 02:43.755
Took you off the ventilator?

02:43.806 --> 02:45.223
I wouldn't have thought her the type.

02:45.258 --> 02:47.642
Yep. She's full of surprises.

02:47.677 --> 02:51.229
You're on your way out then? You agonal?

02:51.264 --> 02:52.647
Not yet.

02:52.682 --> 02:55.883
So, what, you've got an hour, two?

02:55.902 --> 02:57.269
Don't worry.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.886
I've done this before down in the morgue,

02:58.905 --> 03:02.908
and I have an impeccable bedside manner.

03:02.942 --> 03:04.392
Done what?

03:04.410 --> 03:06.728
Help people to cross over.

03:08.197 --> 03:11.082
Charlie...

03:11.117 --> 03:13.118
I'm here to help you die.

03:23.714 --> 03:27.934
(monitor beeping steadily)

03:30.237 --> 03:31.855
Mel?

03:34.241 --> 03:36.276
Mel, Charlie's breathing
still isn't agonal.

03:36.327 --> 03:37.560
It seems fine.

03:37.578 --> 03:39.879
He may breathe for some time.
You know this, Alex.

03:40.522 --> 03:41.748
Right. I was just...

03:41.782 --> 03:45.418
Maybe I wasn't expecting it
to keep sounding... okay.

03:45.453 --> 03:48.505
(sighs)

03:48.539 --> 03:50.040
It's good to see his face.

03:50.074 --> 03:52.208
I've missed it.

03:52.242 --> 03:53.677
Look at you.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.244
You have a change of clothes?

03:55.262 --> 03:57.246
What?

03:58.466 --> 03:59.833
No.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.451
I've got some stuff in my locker.

04:01.485 --> 04:03.386
Thanks. (sighs)

04:10.260 --> 04:12.779
You know, if he's still breathing,

04:12.813 --> 04:14.447
there's time to do something.

04:14.482 --> 04:15.865
I could appeal.

04:15.900 --> 04:16.950
Yeah, you could appeal to Dawn.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.535
You know what I mean. A legal appeal.

04:18.569 --> 04:19.986
I know families of my
patients who have tried.

04:20.036 --> 04:21.538
The odds are impossible, Alex.

04:21.572 --> 04:23.456
Have any of the families ever won?

04:23.491 --> 04:24.958
In all these years, just once.

04:24.992 --> 04:26.493
Who's their lawyer?

04:30.331 --> 04:32.332
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

04:32.383 --> 04:33.500
I know. (sighs)

04:33.551 --> 04:34.801
A bar fight? A broken hand?

04:34.835 --> 04:37.671
On the upside, they're insured.

04:37.722 --> 04:40.473
That's not the point.
We pay you for those hands.

04:40.508 --> 04:41.641
Dana, there's nothing you can say to me

04:41.676 --> 04:42.892
I haven't already said to myself.

04:42.927 --> 04:44.961
Fifth metacarpal fracture?

04:44.979 --> 04:46.129
That's right.

04:46.147 --> 04:47.463
So what are we looking at? A couple weeks?

04:47.481 --> 04:48.631
Just until the splint comes off.

04:48.649 --> 04:50.266
After that, I will be back to work.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.985
Yeah, you better be.

04:52.019 --> 04:53.687
So I guess I see you in a couple of weeks.

04:53.738 --> 04:55.572
No, I can still work.

04:55.606 --> 04:57.607
You can't do surgery.

04:57.641 --> 05:00.243
I can diagnose. I can still consult.

05:00.277 --> 05:02.645
Joel, you just lost a patient.

05:02.663 --> 05:04.414
It comes with the territory.

05:04.448 --> 05:05.782
Suicide?

05:05.816 --> 05:10.053
Dana, I am fine.

05:13.708 --> 05:15.925
(sighs)

05:15.960 --> 05:17.594
I've seen worse.

05:19.496 --> 05:21.381
- (Alex) You have?
- Mm-hmm.

05:21.432 --> 05:23.600
How long will an appeal take?

05:23.634 --> 05:25.969
To write? Oh, couple hours.

05:26.003 --> 05:29.189
I'll just set up shop right
here in the hospital.

05:29.223 --> 05:30.840
I gave up my office.

05:30.858 --> 05:32.392
But hey, it's the age
of the internet, right?

05:32.443 --> 05:34.527
Nothing you can't do on the go.

05:34.562 --> 05:35.695
Okay, so we'll know today?

05:35.730 --> 05:38.698
We will know where we stand.

05:38.733 --> 05:40.450
(clears throat) Alex...

05:40.484 --> 05:42.202
These appeals are rarely granted.

05:42.236 --> 05:46.239
Ah-ah-ah. "Rarely" ain't the same as
"never," my friend.

05:46.290 --> 05:49.242
All it takes is one legal
mistake in your proceedings,

05:49.293 --> 05:50.877
and we are golden.

05:50.911 --> 05:52.361
What do I have to do?

05:52.379 --> 05:54.363
I charge $500 an hour.

05:54.381 --> 05:56.199
I like to get that part out of the way.

05:56.217 --> 05:58.201
Then you leave it to me,
I roll up my sleeves,

05:58.219 --> 06:00.870
and I file an appeal with
the court this afternoon.

06:00.888 --> 06:02.305
(pager buzzes)

06:02.339 --> 06:05.225
(buzz)

06:05.259 --> 06:06.643
Sorry. I have a page.

06:06.677 --> 06:07.927
Oh, before you head off,

06:07.978 --> 06:09.729
I need you to get me
transcripts from your hearing,

06:09.764 --> 06:13.016
your lawyer's notes,
and Charlie's full medical file.

06:13.050 --> 06:15.151
(clears throat)
I'll... I'll get that for you.

06:15.186 --> 06:16.402
It's fine. It's fine.

06:16.437 --> 06:18.221
Thank you.

06:20.191 --> 06:21.324
Hey.

06:21.358 --> 06:23.159
This is one of Charlie's patients?

06:23.194 --> 06:24.577
She was Dr. Macilreath's patient.

06:24.612 --> 06:26.996
After he died, Charlie
did her last follow-up.

06:29.066 --> 06:31.534
Oh. (sighs) This is Bea.

06:31.568 --> 06:32.652
You know her?

06:32.686 --> 06:35.404
Yeah. I-I did her surgery.

06:35.422 --> 06:36.756
I can call someone else.

06:36.791 --> 06:39.425
This is a special case.

06:39.460 --> 06:43.463
I wanna take it. And thank
you for letting me know.

06:46.634 --> 06:47.684
(curtain rings rattle)

06:47.718 --> 06:48.852
Bea?

06:48.886 --> 06:50.970
I'm Dr. Reid.

06:51.021 --> 06:53.106
(curtain rings rattle)

06:53.140 --> 06:54.724
You came in with flu-like symptoms?

06:54.758 --> 06:56.059
If you could just... (gasping)

06:56.093 --> 06:57.393
Okay, you know what?
Uh, don't bother answering.

06:57.427 --> 06:59.612
Nurse? Nurse!

06:59.647 --> 07:01.614
(continues gasping) My name is Victor.

07:01.649 --> 07:04.534
She came in here with flu-like symptoms.
Now she's got stridor.

07:04.568 --> 07:05.702
What's her respiratory rate?

07:05.736 --> 07:07.770
40. And her 02 sats are dropping fast.

07:07.788 --> 07:08.938
(gagging)

07:08.956 --> 07:10.106
You need to intubate.

07:10.124 --> 07:11.741
- Right. Ketamine.
- I'm on it.

07:11.775 --> 07:13.993
Bea, you are gonna be just fine.

07:14.044 --> 07:15.328
What I want you to do

07:15.379 --> 07:16.546
is try to breathe with
me if you can, okay?

07:16.580 --> 07:18.548
Just try to relax.

07:18.582 --> 07:21.467
And one...

07:21.502 --> 07:23.469
Push ketamine, 12 milligrams.

07:23.504 --> 07:24.637
Pushing ketamine.

07:24.672 --> 07:26.923
Bea, try to focus on me if you can, okay?

07:26.957 --> 07:28.791
- Ketamine in.
- Good girl. Good job.

07:28.809 --> 07:30.459
- Okay, let's lay her back.
- All right, here we go.

07:30.477 --> 07:32.262
- Can I get some help in here, please?!
- (grunts) She's out.

07:32.296 --> 07:34.681
I need a flexible
bronchoscope and an O.P.A.

07:36.317 --> 07:37.600
Okay.

07:37.634 --> 07:38.968
Great.

07:40.437 --> 07:42.138
- Get it in there?
- Yep.

07:42.156 --> 07:44.324
Okay.

07:44.358 --> 07:45.608
(click)

07:46.643 --> 07:47.643
Difficult airway.

07:47.661 --> 07:49.645
Do a self-maneuver for me.

07:49.663 --> 07:50.813
All right.

07:52.199 --> 07:53.482
You need to get it in.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.650
The airway's obstructed.

07:54.668 --> 07:56.485
She's going into laryngeal spasm.

07:56.503 --> 07:57.787
Have you done this before?

07:57.821 --> 07:58.922
My first day of residency.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.040
- Dr. Harris!
- (Charlie) Yeah?

08:03.294 --> 08:05.211
It's all right. You've got it.

08:05.262 --> 08:06.296
You've got it.

08:06.330 --> 08:08.298
(Bea groaning) Just relax your wrist.

08:08.332 --> 08:09.933
- Relax.
- Okay.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.168
Now watch the monitor.

08:12.186 --> 08:15.438
More importantly,
feel your way down the trachea.

08:17.141 --> 08:19.025
- You got it.
- I'm in.

08:19.059 --> 08:20.310
Sats are coming back up.

08:20.344 --> 08:22.145
Okay. Thank you.

08:22.179 --> 08:23.479
You just need practice.

08:23.513 --> 08:25.031
You must be our new resident.
I'm Dr. Harris.

08:25.065 --> 08:26.199
I googled you before I...

08:26.233 --> 08:28.151
Put an N.G. tube in,
decompress her stomach,

08:28.185 --> 08:29.485
and get a portable chest.

08:29.519 --> 08:31.274
This is not the flu.

08:32.623 --> 08:33.823
(exhales deeply)

08:33.857 --> 08:36.692
- He's always like that?
- Yep, pretty much.

08:39.246 --> 08:40.380
Bea.

08:40.414 --> 08:42.881
Dr. Reid? Hi. (door closes)

08:42.917 --> 08:44.049
So good to see you.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.551
You, too.

08:45.586 --> 08:47.036
I thought I was meeting with Dr. Harris.

08:47.054 --> 08:49.672
No. He had an accident.

08:49.706 --> 08:52.508
He's actually... in the hospital himself.

08:52.542 --> 08:54.894
Is he okay?

08:54.929 --> 08:56.179
He's just not meeting with patients.

08:56.213 --> 08:59.098
So it's my lucky day. I get to see you.

08:59.149 --> 09:00.350
How's school going?

09:00.384 --> 09:02.819
(grunts)
I'm taking a year off to travel...

09:02.853 --> 09:04.020
with my boyfriend.

09:04.054 --> 09:05.405
Wow.

09:05.439 --> 09:07.556
We're going to Antarctica
and then south Asia.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.326
We're gonna be on a boat for half a year.

09:10.361 --> 09:11.828
Well, I'm glad you're here.

09:11.862 --> 09:14.414
It's good to get one last
appointment before you leave.

09:14.448 --> 09:16.232
Yeah, that's what my family doctor said.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.501
Okay, well, I will give you a physical,

09:18.535 --> 09:19.902
but I'm gonna send you for a chest C.T.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.205
And some blood work first.

09:22.239 --> 09:24.073
Mm, of course. I know the drill.

09:24.091 --> 09:25.458
Then you can have a cup
of coffee or something

09:25.509 --> 09:27.543
while you wait for
the test results to come back.

09:27.577 --> 09:28.711
Have they figured out

09:28.746 --> 09:30.380
how to brew a decent cup
of coffee downstairs yet?

09:30.414 --> 09:31.965
No.

09:32.016 --> 09:35.051
I mean, you could try the latte.
It's drinkable.

09:35.085 --> 09:36.436
Barely.

09:36.470 --> 09:41.090
(monitor beeping steadily)

09:43.593 --> 09:45.061
I'm still breathing.

09:45.095 --> 09:46.529
Barely.

09:46.563 --> 09:48.431
And look...

09:48.449 --> 09:50.433
Alex is trying to save my life.

09:50.451 --> 09:51.784
It might not be my time to go, Mack.

09:51.819 --> 09:53.119
Come on, Charlie.

09:53.153 --> 09:55.038
You're so arrogant,
you think you get to choose?

09:55.072 --> 09:56.706
(sighs deeply)

09:56.740 --> 09:58.908
I'm not ready.

09:58.942 --> 10:02.295
Nobody's ready. That's the point.

10:02.329 --> 10:04.113
Charlie, you were never a renegade

10:04.131 --> 10:05.281
but I always thought you were smart.

10:05.299 --> 10:06.782
I'm...

10:06.800 --> 10:09.419
I'm just saying that sometimes
it takes people a while to...

10:09.453 --> 10:10.887
pass on, you know.

10:10.921 --> 10:12.388
You've done this for other people, right?

10:12.423 --> 10:13.890
There's something you need to figure out...

10:13.924 --> 10:15.308
Before I die.

10:15.342 --> 10:17.343
Now we're getting somewhere.

10:20.397 --> 10:21.731
(sighs deeply)

10:34.881 --> 10:37.300
- What is this?
- Fuel.

10:37.334 --> 10:40.670
You're studying for your boards.
I think you need fuel.

10:40.704 --> 10:43.155
- Gav...
- Hmm?

10:43.190 --> 10:45.975
This is not on.

10:46.009 --> 10:48.477
The kiss, it was... it was a mistake.

10:48.511 --> 10:50.679
Not on my side.

10:50.697 --> 10:53.182
It was, though.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.351
I mean, look, how long
have we been friends for?

10:55.369 --> 10:57.653
Five years or so.

10:57.687 --> 11:00.289
And I love you, and I know you love me.

11:00.324 --> 11:03.376
But we're not <i>in love.</i>

11:03.410 --> 11:05.661
I think there's a couple
of logical fallacies

11:05.695 --> 11:06.846
in that argument.

11:09.182 --> 11:12.551
I'm seeing someone else.

11:12.586 --> 11:14.870
Yeah. I...

11:16.473 --> 11:20.042
And I, uh, I need to study.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.094
All right.

11:24.931 --> 11:26.932
All right.

11:29.486 --> 11:30.686
Did you want that croissant or...

11:30.720 --> 11:31.854
No, I... you...

11:31.888 --> 11:34.156
- Just k... you can... you can keep it.
- Okay.

11:34.191 --> 11:36.275
Great, thanks. I'm gonna have to
get you to print that one off.

11:36.326 --> 11:37.893
A signature for me?

11:37.911 --> 11:39.195
And file this...

11:39.229 --> 11:40.579
- And get this guy out of here.
- I got paged.

11:40.614 --> 11:41.897
Joel. Good, yes.

11:41.915 --> 11:43.783
Nadia bird. Paraplegic,
fell out of her wheelchair.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.252
Colles' fracture to her right wrist.

11:46.286 --> 11:48.904
Chart, please?

11:48.922 --> 11:51.040
What happened to your hand?

11:51.074 --> 11:52.591
Nothing. It's fine.

11:52.626 --> 11:54.760
You break it?

11:54.795 --> 11:56.846
Okay, this looks pretty straightforward.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.014
I'll take a look at it,

11:58.048 --> 11:59.581
but you are gonna have
to do the reduction.

11:59.599 --> 12:02.601
Really? Why? 'cause your hand?

12:03.887 --> 12:05.971
(curtain rings rattle)

12:06.023 --> 12:07.807
Mrs. Bird, I'm Dr. Goran.

12:07.858 --> 12:10.426
Are-are you the surgeon?
Am I gonna need surgery?

12:10.444 --> 12:13.612
Well, hopefully not as long as
we can properly reset the bone.

12:13.647 --> 12:15.281
Uh, let's do a hematoma block.

12:15.315 --> 12:17.233
Uh, 20 mikes of lidocaine.

12:17.267 --> 12:18.367
Let's do 25, just to be safe.

12:18.402 --> 12:20.119
(under breath) Whatever.

12:20.153 --> 12:21.603
Okay, so just try and relax.

12:21.621 --> 12:22.938
Okay.

12:22.956 --> 12:24.407
There we go. (Nadia sighs)

12:24.441 --> 12:26.375
I feel ridiculous.

12:26.410 --> 12:27.877
In front of the whole church,

12:27.911 --> 12:30.863
and my choir's in the middle of
"Amazing Grace."

12:30.897 --> 12:33.749
What do I do? I get too
close to the altar steps

12:33.783 --> 12:36.252
and I tumble right down,
ass over teakettle.

12:36.286 --> 12:37.753
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Oh, that's okay.

12:37.787 --> 12:39.288
Let me do that, please.

12:39.306 --> 12:41.290
Thank you, Dr. Miller.

12:41.308 --> 12:42.808
It's okay, Nadia. It's just
a local anesthetic, yeah.

12:42.843 --> 12:43.976
(whispers) Okay.

12:44.010 --> 12:44.977
(exhales deeply) And how about that?

12:45.011 --> 12:46.145
(inhales deeply)

12:46.179 --> 12:47.313
You feel any pain yet?

12:47.347 --> 12:49.465
Mnh-mnh.

12:49.483 --> 12:52.268
Okay, I'm just gonna get you to relax.

12:52.302 --> 12:54.636
This part is a little bit freaky, okay?

12:54.654 --> 12:56.439
But you just keep breathing.

12:56.473 --> 12:58.741
Just be careful. Here we go.

12:58.775 --> 13:00.493
(exhales deeply)

13:00.527 --> 13:03.446
Breathing.

13:04.998 --> 13:07.683
Okay. Good. How's that?

13:07.718 --> 13:10.486
- Yeah.
- Good.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.089
Okay, go get an X-ray and
make sure it's right.

13:13.123 --> 13:14.423
Should be just fine.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.926
Nadia, I'm just gonna take
a quick look at your legs.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.094
Okay.

13:18.128 --> 13:19.361
Now because of your spinal injury,

13:19.396 --> 13:20.529
obviously you're not
gonna feel any pain here,

13:20.564 --> 13:21.697
- but...
- Uh-huh.

13:21.732 --> 13:23.566
I just need to do a quick
check and make sure

13:23.600 --> 13:26.402
that nothing else was
broken when you fell.

13:26.436 --> 13:28.871
Yeah, can someone let
my friends know I'm okay?

13:28.905 --> 13:30.873
They've been in the waiting room a while.

13:30.907 --> 13:33.776
Is that the choir?

13:33.810 --> 13:35.177
Yeah.

13:35.195 --> 13:38.531
Yep, um, we'll let 'em know
that you are just fine.

13:38.565 --> 13:39.765
Okay, yeah.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.834
Oh!

13:43.236 --> 13:45.538
You can feel that?

13:45.572 --> 13:46.972
(gasps)

13:47.007 --> 13:49.642
Uh... Oh, no. I-I can't have.

13:52.145 --> 13:54.013
Ow!

13:54.047 --> 13:57.399
Nadia, you're feeling pain in your foot.

13:57.434 --> 14:01.303
Oh, that's impossible. (gasps)

14:05.575 --> 14:07.243
It's a huge mediastinal mass.

14:07.277 --> 14:09.245
Given her age, it could be lymphoma.

14:09.279 --> 14:10.646
Then it's treatable.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.815
She survives long enough to get radiation.

14:12.849 --> 14:13.983
Tumor's the size of a grapefruit.

14:14.017 --> 14:15.985
She's got massive pleural effusions.

14:16.019 --> 14:17.870
There's pericardial effusion, too.

14:17.904 --> 14:20.322
Well, if it's lymphoma,
we can't cut it out.

14:20.357 --> 14:22.691
Some fluid, and both her
lungs are compromised.

14:22.725 --> 14:24.660
And I thought you were taking me to lunch.

14:24.694 --> 14:25.828
Mm.

14:25.862 --> 14:27.696
Well, there's compression on the S.V.C.

14:27.730 --> 14:29.331
And most of the mediastinum.

14:29.366 --> 14:30.499
It's a tough call.

14:30.534 --> 14:34.003
Why don't we just drain the fluid?

14:34.037 --> 14:36.038
Who are you?

14:36.072 --> 14:38.591
- New resident. Thank you. We have this covered.
- Alex Reid.

14:39.909 --> 14:41.544
But...

14:41.578 --> 14:43.579
that's what's putting
the pressure on her lungs, right?

14:43.597 --> 14:46.348
I mean, the fluid is
why she can't breathe.

14:46.383 --> 14:48.417
One liter of fluid isn't
gonna make any difference.

14:48.435 --> 14:49.585
And she's still gonna have

14:49.603 --> 14:52.087
a giant tumor blocking
her superior vena cava.

14:52.105 --> 14:54.557
Right, but wouldn't it help?

15:02.265 --> 15:04.283
She's right.

15:04.317 --> 15:06.619
We can do a trach and needle
biopsy at the same time.

15:06.653 --> 15:08.287
Okay, then you don't need me.

15:08.321 --> 15:10.289
Page me when you're done.
I'll take her over to oncology

15:10.323 --> 15:12.291
and let you know when I have a diagnosis.

15:12.325 --> 15:13.459
Great.

15:13.493 --> 15:14.776
(sighs)

15:14.794 --> 15:17.779
So you ready for surgery?

15:17.797 --> 15:19.781
What do you mean?

15:19.799 --> 15:23.669
Time to step up.

15:25.622 --> 15:28.624
(monitor beeping steadily)

15:32.012 --> 15:34.463
I'm not sure that I'm ready to do this.

15:34.481 --> 15:36.265
Hope Zion is a teaching hospital.

15:36.299 --> 15:38.651
I know that,

15:38.685 --> 15:40.319
- But it's...
- But what?

15:40.353 --> 15:43.188
Do you think just a pretty
face is gonna cut it here?

15:45.609 --> 15:46.692
Okay.

15:49.112 --> 15:51.247
Stop.

15:51.281 --> 15:52.331
What are you forgetting?

15:52.365 --> 15:53.916
Uh... Oh. Uh, right.

15:53.950 --> 15:56.252
The patient's name is Bea Pateira.

15:56.286 --> 15:59.838
We are doing a tube thoracostomy
on the left-hand side,

15:59.873 --> 16:01.507
and we will leave a chest tube in.

16:01.541 --> 16:04.293
That's right. Always pause like that,
even if it's an emergency.

16:04.327 --> 16:07.346
You say it out loud to
everyone in the room.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.664
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:08.682 --> 16:10.099
Continue.

16:10.133 --> 16:13.835
(sighing deeply)

16:18.475 --> 16:20.342
(monitor beeps) Okay.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.478
Use your finger to dissect the fat.

16:24.013 --> 16:26.515
I'm in the pleural cavity.

16:26.533 --> 16:27.816
(squish)

16:27.850 --> 16:29.068
Whoa! Oh!

16:29.119 --> 16:30.619
All right, it's more
fluid than we thought.

16:30.654 --> 16:31.787
Don't lose your nerve.

16:31.821 --> 16:33.355
(squish)

16:33.373 --> 16:35.574
Kelly in chest tube.

16:37.193 --> 16:39.211
Remove the kelly, advance the chest tube.

16:39.245 --> 16:40.746
Okay. (sighs)

16:45.034 --> 16:47.670
Feeding it in.

16:47.704 --> 16:48.971
And we're good.

16:49.005 --> 16:50.839
Sample.

16:50.873 --> 16:53.976
(monitor beeping steadily)

16:55.044 --> 16:56.228
Okay.

16:56.262 --> 16:57.713
Good.

16:59.065 --> 17:01.817
Attach the pleurovac, please.

17:05.571 --> 17:06.722
(machine beeps)

17:06.740 --> 17:09.825
(suction gurgling)

17:09.858 --> 17:12.560
(machine beeps)

17:12.579 --> 17:13.912
How's your suturing?

17:13.946 --> 17:15.914
Good.

17:15.949 --> 17:17.733
Then suture.

17:17.751 --> 17:20.234
O-silk, please.

17:27.292 --> 17:29.595
(gurgling continues)

17:29.629 --> 17:31.013
(machine beeps)

17:33.266 --> 17:34.416
Okay.

17:34.434 --> 17:35.584
(monitor beeps)

17:35.602 --> 17:38.937
B.P. is 90 over 60, satting at 92.

17:38.972 --> 17:40.105
Heart rate's 80.

17:40.140 --> 17:41.306
Fluid's completely drained.

17:41.358 --> 17:43.192
There was more than two liters in there.

17:43.226 --> 17:44.777
Wow. (monitor beeps)

17:44.811 --> 17:45.944
Pressure?

17:45.979 --> 17:47.730
B.P.'s over 100.

17:47.764 --> 17:49.531
Vent pressure down.

17:49.566 --> 17:50.699
She's stable.

17:50.734 --> 17:51.867
(gloves snap)

17:51.901 --> 17:54.286
Send the sample to cytology.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.454
(sighs)

17:55.488 --> 17:56.572
(woman) Nice job.

17:56.606 --> 17:58.540
(whispers) Yes! (laughs)

17:58.575 --> 17:59.875
Is there anything in your past

17:59.909 --> 18:01.960
that's preventing you
from making your peace?

18:01.995 --> 18:05.047
Ah, yes... the fact that
I don't want to die.

18:05.081 --> 18:07.716
Charlie, listen.
You weren't always so open.

18:07.751 --> 18:09.968
You could be really closed off, hard.

18:10.003 --> 18:12.137
Were you like that in your marriage?

18:12.172 --> 18:13.806
Is there something in that?

18:13.840 --> 18:16.725
You think I need to make peace with Dawn?

18:16.760 --> 18:19.144
She did pull the plug on ya, after all.

18:19.179 --> 18:21.263
Mack, could you not do that?

18:21.297 --> 18:23.065
You used to drive me
crazy when you did that.

18:23.099 --> 18:25.401
Okay, snap at me.
Take the focus off yourself.

18:25.435 --> 18:26.568
(exhales deeply)

18:26.603 --> 18:28.654
If not resolving some "thing" in my life

18:28.688 --> 18:30.522
is what's keeping me alive,

18:30.573 --> 18:32.157
why would I wanna fix that?

18:32.192 --> 18:34.309
- Hard case.
- Oh, save it.

18:34.327 --> 18:36.779
(Bea) Hi. Are those the sizes?

18:36.813 --> 18:39.481
Um, can I get a large telephone, please?

18:39.499 --> 18:41.149
That's Bea.

18:41.167 --> 18:43.952
Uh, there's a pay phone outside.

18:43.986 --> 18:45.454
I don't want a pay phone.
I want a telephone.

18:45.488 --> 18:47.372
With a shot of vanilla.

18:47.424 --> 18:50.008
Oh, you want a latte?

18:50.043 --> 18:53.262
Yeah. (scoffs)

18:56.599 --> 18:58.300
She just said "telephone."

18:58.334 --> 19:00.001
Maybe she just wants to make a call.

19:00.019 --> 19:02.554
Mack, she's dysphasic.

19:02.605 --> 19:04.156
That could mean...

19:04.190 --> 19:06.525
That she has a brain tumor.

19:14.166 --> 19:17.184
(radio chatter)

19:18.954 --> 19:20.321
Okay, wait. Here it is.

19:20.355 --> 19:22.523
M.R.I. of Nadia's spine.

19:24.192 --> 19:26.193
There's no injury.

19:26.211 --> 19:27.528
I thought she was paralyzed.

19:27.546 --> 19:29.046
She is. Car accident two years ago.

19:29.081 --> 19:30.214
Her husband was killed,

19:30.248 --> 19:31.332
and she was diagnosed with a burst T10,

19:31.366 --> 19:32.733
paralyzed from the waist down.

19:32.768 --> 19:35.319
Yeah, but her T10's fine.

19:35.354 --> 19:37.638
So she's either delusional
or she's faking it.

19:37.673 --> 19:39.073
Really, that's what you jump to?

19:39.107 --> 19:40.374
The M.R.I. doesn't lie.

19:40.409 --> 19:42.176
Well, neither do church ladies.

19:42.210 --> 19:44.562
Well, she's feeling pain in her legs.

19:44.596 --> 19:45.879
Then it's...

19:45.897 --> 19:48.516
Don't talk to me about miracles, please.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.684
A surprising turn of events.

19:49.718 --> 19:51.185
That's what I was gonna say, Joel.

19:51.219 --> 19:53.554

I was boys soprano in
church when I was a kid.

20:22.551 --> 20:23.684
Of course you were.

20:23.719 --> 20:25.419
Uh, man, could you just
ask the holy spirit

20:25.437 --> 20:27.138
to take it outside for a second?

20:27.189 --> 20:29.724
We kind of have business to do here.

20:29.758 --> 20:31.925
They're just trying to cheer me up.

20:41.436 --> 20:42.570

Thank you very much for the singing,

20:45.123 --> 20:47.491
but unfortunately,
it's a little too disruptive,

20:47.542 --> 20:49.943
so I'm gonna have to ask
you to please move out

20:49.961 --> 20:51.545
into the waiting room.

20:51.580 --> 20:52.997
I'm sorry.

20:53.048 --> 20:54.632
(woman) Okay, Nadia, honey,
you know we're right here.

20:54.666 --> 20:56.450
Okay. I'll see ya in a bit.

20:56.468 --> 20:58.636
(woman) Mm. All right, sweetheart.

20:58.670 --> 21:00.388
- Thank you.
- That better?

21:00.422 --> 21:02.006
- (woman) <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- Yeah.

21:04.426 --> 21:05.893
How could she have a brain tumor?

21:05.927 --> 21:09.096
I mean, Hodgkin's lymphoma
doesn't spread to the brain.

21:09.130 --> 21:10.481
No, the odds are unbelievably low.

21:10.515 --> 21:12.900
(breathes deeply)

21:12.934 --> 21:15.269
- Unless...
- She doesn't have Hodgkin's.

21:15.303 --> 21:16.637
(exhales deeply)

21:16.655 --> 21:17.822
We misdiagnosed her.

21:17.856 --> 21:20.374
If we did, her follow-up
won't find it now.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.476
They'll never do a head C.T. for lymphoma.

21:22.494 --> 21:25.663
It's no coincidence you're here,
is it, Mack?

21:25.697 --> 21:28.249
That's what I've been saying.

21:28.283 --> 21:30.334
He loved you so much.
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:30.368 --> 21:31.619
(chuckles)

21:31.653 --> 21:32.770
It was so obvious.

21:32.804 --> 21:34.004
Every time you two were
in a room together,

21:34.039 --> 21:35.623
he just lit up.

21:35.657 --> 21:37.408
I think I lit up.

21:39.044 --> 21:41.762
He was my best friend.
That's what I think about.

21:41.797 --> 21:44.998
From the moment I met him...

21:45.016 --> 21:48.719
He was the only person
I wanted to hang out with.

21:50.489 --> 21:52.139
That's rare.

21:52.173 --> 21:54.174
It is.

21:54.192 --> 21:56.811
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
(Charlie rasping)

21:56.845 --> 21:59.280
Respiratory rate's down. Mel?

21:59.314 --> 22:02.750
(rasping continues)

22:04.853 --> 22:07.621
Cardiac monitors. Can't trust 'em.

22:07.656 --> 22:09.290
He's breathing shallow and irregular.

22:09.324 --> 22:12.660
(rasping and grunting)

22:17.532 --> 22:19.383
(sighs deeply) He's really struggling.

22:19.417 --> 22:21.969
That's how it goes, Alex.

22:22.003 --> 22:23.504
It'll be up and down for a while.

22:26.224 --> 22:27.725
(Alex) And then?

22:38.737 --> 22:40.421
Hey.

22:40.455 --> 22:42.356
Hi.

22:42.390 --> 22:43.741
I'm just... (stammers)

22:43.775 --> 22:45.910
I mean just feeding my coffee addiction.

22:45.944 --> 22:47.111
Cool.

22:47.162 --> 22:48.496
(sighs) Yeah.

22:51.065 --> 22:54.335
So I, uh, heard about Charlie.

22:54.369 --> 22:55.503
I'm so sorry.

22:55.537 --> 22:57.254
Don't be. It's not over.

22:57.289 --> 22:59.507
Yeah, I have my lawyer filing an appeal.

22:59.541 --> 23:00.875
Well, that's good.

23:00.909 --> 23:02.209
Yeah.

23:02.243 --> 23:05.196
(siren wailing in distance)

23:05.230 --> 23:06.764
What happened to you?

23:06.798 --> 23:08.265
Uh... nothing.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.884
Just an accident.

23:09.918 --> 23:11.585
Enough said.

23:11.603 --> 23:13.137
Yeah. (chuckles)

23:13.188 --> 23:15.389
- Okay. I'll see you around.
- So I'll see you later, yeah.

23:15.423 --> 23:16.590
Mm.

23:20.595 --> 23:23.397
(curtain rings rattle)

23:23.431 --> 23:24.982
So how the legs feeling?

23:25.033 --> 23:27.601
Um... kind of tingly.

23:27.619 --> 23:30.287
Like... pins and needles,
and all the way down.

23:30.322 --> 23:31.739
(inhales sharply)

23:31.773 --> 23:33.374
It's like I just met Jesus
at the pool of Bethesda.

23:33.408 --> 23:35.793
Hey, your muscles have atrophied.

23:35.827 --> 23:38.128
Yeah. I know I shouldn't complain,

23:38.163 --> 23:40.948
but it's actually kind of painful.

23:40.966 --> 23:45.452
Nadia, I just had your chart
sent over from St. Mike's.

23:45.470 --> 23:48.038
Uh, this an image taken two
years ago after the accident.

23:48.073 --> 23:51.959
So you had a spinal epidural
hematoma in the T10 vertebrae.

23:51.977 --> 23:53.978
Yeah, well, I know I had something.

23:54.012 --> 23:55.429
That sounds about right.

23:55.463 --> 23:57.965
So the surgeons did a...

23:57.983 --> 23:59.433
spinal decompression,

23:59.467 --> 24:02.903
which, according to this image here,

24:02.938 --> 24:04.405
went extremely well.

24:04.439 --> 24:06.824
You see the cord's continuous.
No swelling, plenty of room,

24:06.858 --> 24:08.976
and yet you remained paralyzed.

24:09.010 --> 24:12.496
Yeah. M-my doctors,
they didn't have an explanation

24:12.530 --> 24:15.499
except to say it happens
that way sometimes.

24:15.533 --> 24:19.086
You didn't request a second opinion?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.755
I put my faith in the lord.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.757
Ooh! (laughs)

24:23.792 --> 24:25.843
And now look. He's healing me.

24:25.877 --> 24:27.344
Mrs. Bird,

24:27.379 --> 24:31.131
I have a responsibility to get
your diagnosis right here.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.601
And getting your legs
back after two years,

24:33.635 --> 24:36.387
it isn't... possible.

24:38.223 --> 24:41.275
And yet, it is.

24:41.309 --> 24:44.478
Okay.

24:44.512 --> 24:46.981
Well, then I will find you
something for the pain.

24:47.015 --> 24:48.232
Mm-hmm.

24:48.283 --> 24:51.368
In the meantime,
I'll review your files and...

24:51.403 --> 24:53.654
see if I can recommend
a course of treatment.

24:53.688 --> 24:55.188
Okay.

24:59.577 --> 25:00.628
(velcro rips)

25:00.662 --> 25:01.962
Your blood pressure's fine.

25:01.997 --> 25:04.715
And I wanted you to see this.

25:04.749 --> 25:06.533
Your chest X-ray came back.

25:06.551 --> 25:07.668
You're free and clear.

25:07.702 --> 25:09.386
That's four years in a row.

25:09.421 --> 25:10.721
Congratulations.

25:10.755 --> 25:12.389
(chuckles)

25:12.424 --> 25:15.208
So any other symptoms?
Swollen lymph glands?

25:15.226 --> 25:16.877
Night sweats? Itching?

25:16.895 --> 25:18.228
I've had some headaches.

25:18.263 --> 25:20.898
Headaches, Alex, and dysphasia.
Come on, Bea, keep talk.

25:20.932 --> 25:23.183
- Bad headaches?
- No, it's just stress.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.351
No, it's not.

25:24.385 --> 25:25.519
And with the research trip coming up,

25:25.553 --> 25:26.987
I've been getting vaccinations.

25:27.022 --> 25:30.274
Right. South Asia.
So you've been getting...

25:30.325 --> 25:31.659
hep "A" and "B," typhoid,

25:31.693 --> 25:34.061
rabies, and japanese encephalitis?

25:34.079 --> 25:35.863
- Yep, that sounds right.
- That's a mean cocktail.

25:35.897 --> 25:37.197
Any one of these would
give you a headache.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.365
I know it's outside the realm of lymphoma,

25:38.399 --> 25:40.918
but send her for a brain scan, Alex.

25:40.952 --> 25:42.870
So...

25:42.904 --> 25:45.172
with your boyfriend Keith?
You sound happy.

25:45.206 --> 25:46.874
(groans) Really happy.

25:46.908 --> 25:48.258
Good.

25:48.293 --> 25:51.695
Um, what kind of accident
did Dr. Harris have?

25:51.730 --> 25:54.014
He was in a car accident.

25:54.049 --> 25:56.350
Is he gonna be okay?

25:56.384 --> 25:58.919
He'll be fine.

25:58.937 --> 26:01.305
And that is all.

26:01.356 --> 26:02.523
(sighs)

26:02.557 --> 26:04.091
You're done.

26:04.109 --> 26:07.227
Thank you, Dr. Reid.

26:07.261 --> 26:10.147
You're welcome.

26:10.198 --> 26:12.766
Charlie would be so happy for you.

26:16.104 --> 26:17.988
She's gonna die if you
don't think of something.

26:18.039 --> 26:19.656
I know. This is over my head.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.159
This isn't liposarcoma with five
different kinds of approach.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.494
No, it isn't.

26:23.545 --> 26:25.829
Bea, don't go. Don't walk out that door.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.047
She's not hearing you.

26:27.082 --> 26:29.416
Stop!

26:30.418 --> 26:32.119
Turn around.

26:32.137 --> 26:33.754
You feel me and you hear me.

26:33.788 --> 26:35.305
I'm-I'm... I'm your gut instinct.

26:35.340 --> 26:36.924
I am the voice in the back of your head,

26:36.958 --> 26:38.142
and I am telling you,

26:38.176 --> 26:40.127
those words you keep misusing and those...

26:40.145 --> 26:43.347
those headaches you keep having,
they mean something.

26:43.398 --> 26:45.265
Don't you go.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.468
Turn around.

26:55.443 --> 26:57.544
Did I just do that?

27:00.438 --> 27:04.358
(monitor beeping steadily)

27:04.392 --> 27:05.392
(knocks)

27:07.945 --> 27:09.262
Hi.

27:09.280 --> 27:13.933
I just wanted to check in,
see how he was doing.

27:13.951 --> 27:15.869
Of course. I'll give you a minute.

27:15.903 --> 27:18.572
No. Stay. Stay.

27:18.606 --> 27:21.541
No, really. Take a minute with him.

27:31.753 --> 27:33.520
What happened?

27:33.554 --> 27:35.372
I'm sorry. The court...

27:35.406 --> 27:38.091
They won't even hear the appeal,
the bastards.

27:38.126 --> 27:39.559
What? I...

27:39.594 --> 27:40.727
(sighs)

27:40.762 --> 27:42.379
I don't understand.

27:42.413 --> 27:45.265
There were no legal
errors in your proceeding,

27:45.299 --> 27:48.985
but I was hoping to sell
them on unreasonable result.

27:49.020 --> 27:50.136
They didn't buy it.

27:50.154 --> 27:51.805
But... (sighs)

27:51.823 --> 27:53.607
He's <i>breathing.</i>

27:53.641 --> 27:55.909
Doesn't matter to the court.

27:55.943 --> 27:58.028
So...

27:58.079 --> 28:00.530
that's it?

28:00.565 --> 28:02.416
Look at it this way.

28:02.450 --> 28:04.251
You've tried everything.

28:04.285 --> 28:07.954
Now you can just... be there for him.

28:09.624 --> 28:12.092
(whispers) I'm sorry.

28:12.126 --> 28:13.493
Mm.

28:15.046 --> 28:18.498
(sighing)

28:21.219 --> 28:23.136
It's, um...

28:24.138 --> 28:26.172
It's okay to be upset.

28:27.174 --> 28:30.343
Is it? Really?

28:30.361 --> 28:32.562
What can I do to help?

28:32.597 --> 28:35.482
You can take the D.N.R.,
which Charlie never believed in,

28:35.516 --> 28:37.367
off his chart.

28:38.703 --> 28:40.620
No?

28:40.655 --> 28:43.373
(chuckles and scoffs)

28:43.407 --> 28:44.374
(thud)

28:44.408 --> 28:45.909
Then go to hell!

28:48.079 --> 28:50.063
(sighs)

28:54.535 --> 28:56.136
(beeps)

28:59.590 --> 29:01.258
(closes microwave door)

29:06.147 --> 29:07.380
Hey.

29:07.398 --> 29:08.765
I am assuming that you've heard

29:08.816 --> 29:10.517
about my patient. (thuds)

29:10.551 --> 29:13.937
De-paralysis. Yes. Indeed I have.

29:13.988 --> 29:17.073
So... traumatic event two years ago.

29:17.108 --> 29:19.359
(sighs) Car accident. Husband died.

29:19.393 --> 29:22.279
I'm starting to believe that
she has conversion disorder.

29:22.330 --> 29:23.914
Yeah. Could be.

29:23.948 --> 29:25.732
Uh, it's often misdiagnosed
as malingering,

29:25.750 --> 29:27.901
a patient making up
symptoms for attention.

29:27.919 --> 29:29.085
She's not making it up.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.421
No. No, to her, it's completely real.

29:31.455 --> 29:33.340
Her mind is distracting
from her emotional trauma

29:33.374 --> 29:35.008
by making it physical.

29:35.042 --> 29:37.677
So then why are her legs
working now? Popcorn?

29:37.712 --> 29:39.629
- No.
- Yes.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.914
Uh, it could be her latest accident.

29:40.932 --> 29:42.549
She relived her trauma.

29:42.583 --> 29:43.884
(crunches) So what do I do?

29:43.918 --> 29:45.101
You celebrate.

29:45.136 --> 29:47.854
A paralyzed woman may walk again.
Hallelujah!

29:47.889 --> 29:50.023
Are you 100% sure you have a
medical degree? (crunching)

29:50.057 --> 29:51.758
Look, all I'm saying
is that it's good news,

29:51.776 --> 29:53.443
so why do you have to fix it?

29:53.477 --> 29:55.779
Because she has emotional problems so bad

29:55.813 --> 29:57.480
she's convinced herself she couldn't walk.

29:57.532 --> 29:58.565
I think that she needs

29:58.599 --> 29:59.816
an appropriate course of treatment,

29:59.867 --> 30:02.118
so that she can get
the full use of her limbs again.

30:02.153 --> 30:03.987
She definitely could use
some long-term therapy.

30:04.038 --> 30:05.539
- Right.
- I'm happy to talk to her,

30:05.573 --> 30:06.790
but we can't force her to deal with trauma

30:06.824 --> 30:08.074
if she's not ready.

30:08.108 --> 30:11.328
So what is it that you do here again?

30:13.781 --> 30:15.549
(door opens)

30:15.583 --> 30:17.968
(mouth full)
That guy has some serious issues.

30:18.002 --> 30:20.136
Hate the word "issues."

30:20.171 --> 30:22.789
(crunches)

30:22.807 --> 30:25.809
(monitor beeping steadily)

30:31.265 --> 30:33.233
Dr. Reid?

30:33.267 --> 30:34.985
Bea.

30:35.019 --> 30:37.237
I, uh...

30:37.271 --> 30:39.239
I couldn't leave without saying hi to him.

30:39.273 --> 30:40.740
Of course.

30:40.775 --> 30:42.809
Why didn't you tell me how bad it was?

30:43.961 --> 30:46.112
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

30:46.146 --> 30:47.948
Well, I'm glad I came back.

30:47.982 --> 30:50.984
Um, I brought him some shoes.

30:53.153 --> 30:54.788
You brought him what?

30:54.822 --> 30:56.873
I don't know if he can
have them in here, but...

30:56.924 --> 30:58.174
Have what, Bea?

30:58.209 --> 31:00.393
The shoes.

31:00.428 --> 31:02.846
Those aren't shoes, hon. They're flowers.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.998
That's what I meant. I just, um...

31:05.016 --> 31:06.716
You know, my brain's so
scattered with packing,

31:06.767 --> 31:08.935
and the vaccinations... they do a number

31:08.970 --> 31:10.870
on your system, right, so I...

31:10.905 --> 31:13.256
Would you like to have
a minute alone with Charlie?

31:14.725 --> 31:15.909
(whispers) Okay.

31:15.943 --> 31:16.993
(normal voice) I'll be right out there.

31:17.028 --> 31:19.062
Okay. Thank you.

31:19.113 --> 31:20.230
(whispers) Yeah.

31:20.281 --> 31:21.898
Hey.

31:21.949 --> 31:23.233
Hey. Is everything okay?

31:23.284 --> 31:24.367
Yes. No.

31:24.402 --> 31:25.902
Um... (sighs) um, I need to find Shahir.

31:25.953 --> 31:27.153
Can you just keep her here?

31:27.187 --> 31:28.154
Yeah. No problem.

31:28.188 --> 31:30.624
Great. (smacks counter)

31:30.658 --> 31:32.409
And that...

31:32.460 --> 31:33.410
(rustles)

31:33.461 --> 31:34.544
is how you do that.

31:36.297 --> 31:38.581
Tough surgery.

31:38.633 --> 31:40.216
I don't know what you saw
from up in the gallery,

31:40.251 --> 31:42.502
- but that gall bladder...
it had several adhesions.
- Oh.

31:42.536 --> 31:43.920
It had fatty tissues. It had...

31:43.971 --> 31:45.155
You did good work.

31:45.189 --> 31:47.724
Uh-huh. Then why are you here?

31:48.976 --> 31:51.261
To offer you the job of chief resident.

31:51.312 --> 31:55.815
Uh, last time I checked,
Reid had that job.

31:55.850 --> 31:57.317
She needs some time.

31:57.351 --> 31:59.653
Well, does she know?

32:01.155 --> 32:03.690
Not yet. (sighs)

32:05.159 --> 32:07.861
Uh, it's what I wanted,

32:07.895 --> 32:09.829
just not how I wanted to get it.

32:09.864 --> 32:11.781
I know the feeling.

32:11.816 --> 32:14.668
It's yours if you want it.

32:14.702 --> 32:16.453
I do.

32:16.504 --> 32:18.621
You're a terrific surgeon.

32:18.673 --> 32:20.090
(pats arm) You'll do great.

32:22.593 --> 32:26.012
She's dysphasic.
She called flowers "shoes."

32:26.047 --> 32:28.214
Dysphasia indicates a brain tumor.

32:28.248 --> 32:31.267
But Hodgkin's lymphoma
doesn't recur in the brain.

32:31.302 --> 32:32.469
Well, then she doesn't have Hodgkin's.

32:32.520 --> 32:33.470
But she does.

32:33.521 --> 32:34.971
Dr. Macilreath diagnosed her with it.

32:35.022 --> 32:36.189
Well, then there's an error

32:36.223 --> 32:38.274
in the pathology report on the biopsy.

32:38.309 --> 32:39.275
What?

32:39.310 --> 32:41.928
(papers rustling)

32:41.946 --> 32:43.646
Alex, look at this.

32:43.698 --> 32:46.766
This report shows features
that are compatible

32:46.784 --> 32:49.452
with a-a high-grade malignant glioma.

32:49.487 --> 32:51.371
So she was misdiagnosed?

32:51.405 --> 32:53.323
Sample size is too small. I can't tell.

32:53.374 --> 32:55.492
We need to get a brain C.T. right now.

32:58.612 --> 32:59.879
(telephone keys click)

33:02.318 --> 33:04.536
(indistinct conversations)

33:04.571 --> 33:06.455
Time for a break?

33:06.489 --> 33:09.157
I was thinking we could try
that hill down by the ravine,

33:09.191 --> 33:11.243
bet the grass gets really slick.

33:11.294 --> 33:14.529
A little tray sledding?

33:15.582 --> 33:17.382
Thought we made a mistake.

33:17.417 --> 33:21.536
We did, but I want to be your friend.

33:23.339 --> 33:26.058
Maggie... (sighs) I'm sorry.

33:26.092 --> 33:28.644
I can't do this.

33:28.678 --> 33:31.313
(files rustle)

33:31.347 --> 33:33.565
(telephone rings in distance)

33:33.600 --> 33:35.984
I'm not gonna lie to you.

33:36.019 --> 33:38.153
This is harder than it looks. (chuckles)

33:38.187 --> 33:40.072
Well, you haven't moved
your legs in almost two years.

33:40.106 --> 33:42.024
It's gonna be a process.

33:42.058 --> 33:43.725
Yeah. I shouldn't push it.
Is that what you're saying?

33:43.743 --> 33:44.910
Uh-huh. Look, I can't help it.

33:44.944 --> 33:48.163
God is working through me. (laughs)

33:48.197 --> 33:49.948
Nadia, I would like to talk to you about

33:49.999 --> 33:51.416
what you're suffering...

33:51.451 --> 33:53.952
what you're actually suffering.

33:54.003 --> 33:57.289
Have you heard of something called
"conversion disorder"?

33:57.340 --> 33:59.124
No.

33:59.175 --> 34:01.760
Sometimes after a trauma,

34:01.794 --> 34:03.862
we'll do anything to protect ourselves,

34:03.896 --> 34:05.514
like if it it's something
we really don't want

34:05.548 --> 34:07.382
to deal with,

34:07.416 --> 34:09.801
like the, uh, the loss of a loved one,

34:09.851 --> 34:13.021
we might make up a story,

34:13.056 --> 34:14.188
something to deflect our attention

34:14.223 --> 34:16.141
from what's really going on.

34:17.493 --> 34:19.895
You lost your husband Alfred, right?

34:19.929 --> 34:22.813
Yes.

34:22.864 --> 34:25.467
I know the grief from that
must have been enormous.

34:25.501 --> 34:28.704
Did you ever talk to anybody about it?

34:28.737 --> 34:31.322
I talked to god.

34:31.357 --> 34:33.141
Every day.

34:33.176 --> 34:37.029
Did you ever talk to anybody
professional about it?

34:37.063 --> 34:38.630
I...

34:38.665 --> 34:40.248
I had too much stuff to deal with...

34:40.282 --> 34:43.502
Uh, the loss of my legs, my wheelchair.

34:43.553 --> 34:45.304
I-I didn't have time to think...

34:45.338 --> 34:48.556
(panting)

34:48.591 --> 34:50.425
(voice breaking) ab...

34:50.458 --> 34:52.344
about, uh...

34:54.147 --> 34:56.148
Getting your legs back isn't gonna be easy

34:56.181 --> 34:57.899
physically or emotionally.

34:57.934 --> 35:00.969
(crying)

35:00.987 --> 35:02.938
Now listen to me.

35:02.972 --> 35:06.525
We have a great counselor
here at Hope Zion,

35:06.576 --> 35:09.745
a-and I'm gonna put you in touch with him.

35:19.372 --> 35:21.790
You've got a glioma, Bea.

35:22.775 --> 35:24.676
A mass in the left parietal lobe

35:24.711 --> 35:26.678
of your brain.

35:26.713 --> 35:29.898
The cancer...

35:29.932 --> 35:31.516
it's in my brain?

35:31.551 --> 35:33.051
Yes.

35:33.102 --> 35:34.770
But I was g...

35:34.804 --> 35:38.690
I was gonna go around the world.
I was gonna see the Antarctic.

35:40.443 --> 35:43.228
How could this happen?

35:43.279 --> 35:44.312
We think, when you were diagnosed

35:44.346 --> 35:47.049
four years ago, the pathology was wrong.

35:47.083 --> 35:49.601
You see, you were treated
for Hodgkin's lymphoma,

35:49.635 --> 35:52.821
when you should have been
treated for T-cell lymphoma,

35:52.855 --> 35:54.206
but we get you the right treatment now,

35:54.240 --> 35:56.708
and-and you can beat this thing.

35:56.743 --> 35:59.961
(sniffles)

35:59.996 --> 36:01.880
I'm scared. (chuckles)

36:01.914 --> 36:04.966
Of course you are, Bea, but it'll be okay.

36:05.001 --> 36:06.367
(sniffles)

36:06.386 --> 36:09.554
I'll be with you every
step of the way, okay?

36:09.589 --> 36:11.590
(sighs)

36:11.641 --> 36:13.959
So I'll take you down to oncology.

36:13.993 --> 36:14.976
I called your parents.

36:15.011 --> 36:16.595
(sniffling, inhales deeply)

36:16.646 --> 36:17.763
They'll meet us down there.

36:17.814 --> 36:20.649
(sighs) Okay.

36:20.683 --> 36:22.934
(whispers) Okay.

36:22.985 --> 36:25.070
(sighs)

36:34.247 --> 36:37.115
I was the girl's oncologist.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.533
How did I miss it?

36:38.567 --> 36:40.202
(sighs) We all miss a few, Mack.

36:40.236 --> 36:42.070
But I was arrogant, wasn't I?

36:42.088 --> 36:44.239
I was <i>so</i> sure she had Hodgkin's.

36:44.257 --> 36:46.174
All the signs were pointing to it.

36:46.209 --> 36:47.626
I might have signed that
girl's death warrant

36:47.677 --> 36:50.545
if it weren't for you today.
(switches clicking)

36:50.579 --> 36:51.546
I guess it's time.

36:51.580 --> 36:55.801
(sighs) I'm not ready, Mack.

36:55.852 --> 36:59.771
Don't worry. It's not your time.

36:59.806 --> 37:01.723
What?

37:01.757 --> 37:04.226
You're still breathing up there.
You're still alive.

37:04.260 --> 37:07.629
Push past the familiar thinking.

37:07.663 --> 37:09.197
Just because
the ventilator's been turned off

37:09.232 --> 37:10.916
doesn't mean you have to die.

37:12.268 --> 37:14.152
Then what was all this for?

37:14.203 --> 37:17.438
You were here to help me.

37:20.293 --> 37:22.294
And look.

37:23.963 --> 37:27.048
(echoing voice) I wonder what happens now.

37:32.505 --> 37:35.507
(monitor beeping steadily)

37:39.962 --> 37:42.981
I'm not going anywhere, Alex, believe me.

37:44.150 --> 37:47.135
I'm staying right here.

37:47.153 --> 37:49.137
(sighs)

37:50.806 --> 37:53.358
Alex, I know you're upset with me.

37:53.409 --> 37:55.476
I just... I don't want to argue.

37:55.495 --> 37:58.747
Okay, listen, just put
your hand on his chest.

37:58.781 --> 38:01.249
(sighs) I heard how he's doing.

38:01.284 --> 38:03.201
No, please. Just come over here

38:03.252 --> 38:05.954
and put your hand on his chest. Please.

38:11.043 --> 38:14.329
(sighs)

38:16.182 --> 38:20.001
Do you feel that?
Do you feel how strong it is?

38:20.019 --> 38:22.837
His respiratory rate's
within normal parameters.

38:24.891 --> 38:28.393
He's breathing normally, Dawn.
It's almost been 24 hours,

38:28.427 --> 38:30.946
and he's breathing just like you and me.

38:30.980 --> 38:33.498
(whispers) How is that possible?

38:33.533 --> 38:36.184
Something's changed.

38:36.202 --> 38:38.320
It has.

38:40.323 --> 38:42.690
(sighs)

38:42.708 --> 38:46.494
(blows air) Okay.

38:51.884 --> 38:55.136
(blows air)

38:55.171 --> 38:56.972
(sighs)

38:57.006 --> 38:59.040
(whispers) Yes. (giggles)

38:59.058 --> 39:01.259
Think you killed the patient.

39:03.896 --> 39:05.046
You turned him into rubber.

39:06.649 --> 39:08.233
I cut off his torso.

39:08.267 --> 39:10.936
He wouldn't answer any of my questions.

39:10.987 --> 39:13.238
How many times have you run through that?

39:13.272 --> 39:16.992
Oh, I don't know. (chuckles) About 10,000.

39:17.026 --> 39:20.161
You know, everyone has a tough intubation.

39:20.196 --> 39:21.229
Hell, when I started,

39:21.247 --> 39:24.532
I had a tough couple dozen. (sighs)

39:24.566 --> 39:27.068
Then one day, they just start to happen.

39:27.086 --> 39:29.588
You know, it's like,
you... you believe you can do it,

39:29.622 --> 39:32.591
and then one day, you just can.

39:32.625 --> 39:35.076
So you're not angry?

39:35.094 --> 39:39.130
No, I'm not angry.
You did a great job today.

39:39.165 --> 39:42.968
You know, I did tell you
we had it covered, though.

39:43.970 --> 39:46.304
I knew you didn't mean it.

39:46.355 --> 39:47.772
Uh-huh.

39:47.807 --> 39:49.641
(laughs)

39:49.692 --> 39:50.892
So you ready for dinner?

39:50.926 --> 39:52.694
Dawn. Yes.

39:52.728 --> 39:53.695
Hey.

39:53.729 --> 39:54.696
Hi.

39:54.730 --> 39:56.982
I will see you around, Dr. Reid.

40:05.441 --> 40:09.377
(monitor beeping steadily)

40:09.412 --> 40:13.381
(sighs)

40:18.771 --> 40:20.505
He shouldn't be D.N.R.

40:21.590 --> 40:23.725
(chuckles)

40:27.629 --> 40:30.382
Will you do whatever
needs to be done legally?

40:30.416 --> 40:31.966
Of course.

40:31.984 --> 40:34.936
Not tomorrow, Dawn. Right now.

40:34.970 --> 40:38.106
Yeah.

41:01.163 --> 41:02.230
(Andy Brown's "lovesick lullaby" playing)

41:02.264 --> 41:03.448
(voice breaks) Take care of him.

41:03.482 --> 41:05.433
I promise.

41:12.007 --> 41:13.892
<i>The diagnosis...</i>

He's still breathing.
Maybe he was always breathing,
