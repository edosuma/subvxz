01:01.204 --> 01:03.122
Hey... hey. Come here.
What's the matter?

01:03.123 --> 01:04.498
Nothing.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.790
Come back over here.

01:05.791 --> 01:07.834
No.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.127
Why not?

01:09.128 --> 01:11.296
Just because.

01:11.297 --> 01:13.507
I don't have to have a reason.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.133
Maybe I want to sit and
watch the ducks more.

01:15.134 --> 01:17.511
Hey, ducks
don't swim at night.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.304
They're headlights
short circuit in the water.

01:19.305 --> 01:21.766
Come on.
Give me a kiss.

01:26.145 --> 01:27.687
Not here.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.147
All right.

01:29.148 --> 01:30.649
All of a sudden the car's
not good enough anymore.

01:30.650 --> 01:31.942
- Is that it?
- No!

01:31.943 --> 01:33.818
Well, look.
I can't afford another motel room.

01:33.819 --> 01:35.278
We spent all my money.

01:35.279 --> 01:37.239
On beer.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.325
You were happy enough
to drink your share.

01:46.290 --> 01:48.959
I just don't like it here.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.962
I don't feel right.

01:52.088 --> 01:54.464
Could we at least put the top up?

01:54.465 --> 01:56.300
Do I ever deny you anything?

02:19.490 --> 02:21.658
Can't we go somewhere else?

02:21.659 --> 02:23.410
Somewhere more private?

02:23.411 --> 02:24.536
Why?

02:24.537 --> 02:26.079
The campus cops know
not to bother any car

02:26.080 --> 02:28.456
with a school sticker on it.

02:28.457 --> 02:30.250
I mean, they'd rather have
us parking on campus

02:30.251 --> 02:32.211
than on some deserted road.

02:38.301 --> 02:40.094
I love you.

02:43.848 --> 02:45.516
Do you love me?

02:49.645 --> 02:51.314
Do you love me?

02:53.774 --> 02:55.442
Hey, I'm out with you, aren't I?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.110
Yeah, but you've been
out with lots of girls,

02:57.111 --> 02:59.070
and you didn't love all of them.

02:59.071 --> 03:01.239
Well that was different.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.618
Yeah, but do you love me?

03:05.953 --> 03:07.830
Of course, I do.

03:29.894 --> 03:32.520
Shhh.
What was that?

03:32.521 --> 03:34.064
I heard something?

03:34.065 --> 03:35.690
Yeah, it was me
breathing in your ear.

03:35.691 --> 03:38.276
No, really, I heard something.

03:38.277 --> 03:41.196
So what.
It was the ducks.

03:41.197 --> 03:44.200
Sometimes they like to come up
and terrorize the people parking.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.119
You're obnoxious.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.498
There's not another girl on earth
who would put up with your garbage.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.416
Give me another kiss.

03:53.417 --> 03:55.335
Did you feel that?

03:55.336 --> 03:57.087
The car moved.
Someone's out there.

03:57.088 --> 04:00.548
Yeah, it's probably some
of the guys on the team.

04:00.549 --> 04:03.343
Just jealous of their quarterback.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.888
Always some wise guy around here.

04:06.889 --> 04:08.640
Just ignore them.

04:08.641 --> 04:10.685
Let 'em find their own girl.

04:12.478 --> 04:14.020
All right!
Cut it out!

04:14.021 --> 04:15.689
Leave us alone!

04:15.690 --> 04:17.565
Can't we go someplace else, please?

04:17.565 --> 04:21.486
No. I'm not gonna be scared off
by a bunch of frustrated jocks!

04:21.487 --> 04:22.946
I tell you what I will do.

04:22.947 --> 04:24.364
I'll get out and beat
some manners into them!

04:24.365 --> 04:28.076
No! No! Don't do that.
It won't solve anything.

04:28.077 --> 04:30.745
Take me someplace else,
and I'll make it up to you.

04:30.746 --> 04:32.748
I'll make you glad you did.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.920
What's that?

04:39.839 --> 04:42.716
All right, that's it!

04:42.717 --> 04:44.676
What the hell?

04:44.677 --> 04:47.138
We're out of here!

04:52.685 --> 04:54.061
Oh!

06:08.719 --> 06:11.721
I meant to study for this exam.
I really was gonna read

06:11.722 --> 06:16.976
the last two chapters,
but that boy from Old Dominion

06:16.977 --> 06:18.436
he is so sexy!

06:18.437 --> 06:20.605
I know what you mean.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.982
Gary was going to help
me study last night.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.361
We got to talking and then we
finally got a little side tracked.

06:26.362 --> 06:28.112
And then the first thing
you know it's morning!

06:28.113 --> 06:29.989
I didn't have anything to wear,

06:29.990 --> 06:32.534
so I had to borrow
this from Kathy.

06:32.535 --> 06:34.577
I hate history anyway!

06:34.578 --> 06:35.954
It's so boring!

06:35.955 --> 06:37.664
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.999
- You ready for this?
- I guess. Are you?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.543
Oh, hardly.

06:41.544 --> 06:44.754
I only know about half of it,
and that's the easy half.

06:44.755 --> 06:47.382
I mean, what do I have to
take chemistry for anyway?

06:47.383 --> 06:50.176
- I'm going into advertising.
- Yeah, I know.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.970
Well, that is a
problem with education.

06:51.971 --> 06:54.222
They do keep trying to
teach you all that stuff.

06:54.223 --> 06:57.600
Yeah, like chemistry.
I hate chemistry.

06:57.601 --> 06:59.602
I mean, chemistry hates me.
It's that simple.

06:59.603 --> 07:02.397
Come on.
It's really not that bad.

07:02.398 --> 07:05.733
It's easy for you to say, but I have
to make an 82 on this exam

07:05.734 --> 07:07.235
to pass the course.

07:07.236 --> 07:08.695
And if I don't pass the course,

07:08.696 --> 07:12.282
my parents stop making
the payments on my car.

07:12.283 --> 07:15.702
I mean, this is serious.

07:15.703 --> 07:20.039
An 82 or else I have to walk.
This is war.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.791
Well, you can't just give up.
You have to try to...

07:21.792 --> 07:24.544
Oh, just stop before you tell me
that quitters never win.

07:24.545 --> 07:28.048
I do not want to hear that
because I'm a winner.

07:29.925 --> 07:32.261
- Not to worry.
- Hey, guys. Wait up!

07:33.596 --> 07:35.179
Did you hear what
happened at March College?

07:35.180 --> 07:36.514
- Hi, Radish.
- Hi.

07:36.515 --> 07:38.099
No.
What happened at March College?

07:38.100 --> 07:39.934
Another football recruiting scandal?

07:39.935 --> 07:42.437
No. Better.
A mass murderer.

07:42.438 --> 07:44.647
Two kids were snuffed
while parking at the lake.

07:44.648 --> 07:46.482
- Oh, how horrible.
- I know.

07:46.483 --> 07:48.985
- That's awful!
- You call that a mass murderer?

07:48.986 --> 07:51.946
Two lousy people?
I call that a piker.

07:51.947 --> 07:53.573
Well, it's a small school.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.658
You have to enter
that into the equation.

07:55.659 --> 07:57.827
And it was particularly brutal,

07:57.828 --> 08:01.247
a real spectacle
at least on a local scale.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.000
Sure, it's nothing in a big city,
but in a rural area,

08:04.001 --> 08:05.752
you have to take what you can get.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.670
You two are so morbid.

08:07.671 --> 08:09.380
Oh, you're beyond that.

08:09.381 --> 08:13.635
And to top it all off, the guy
was their first string quarterback.

08:13.636 --> 08:16.262
- You know, I think that we...
- Now you're talking.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.972
You know, we might be
able to take 'em this year.

08:17.973 --> 08:18.973
Yeah.

08:18.974 --> 08:21.434
Remember me telling you about those
students that got it up in Vermont?

08:21.435 --> 08:23.770
- I don't want to...
- This could be the same guy.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.522
Oh, gag.
Oh, come on.

08:26.523 --> 08:29.943
Let's change the subject to
something a little less drastic.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.653
Well, like the test.

08:31.654 --> 08:33.780
Personally, I'd like to talk
about something cheery

08:33.780 --> 08:38.618
like homicidal maniacs,
anything but chemistry.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.578
You're kidding?
This is real crypt stuff.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.914
Chemistry for morons.

08:43.916 --> 08:45.084
No offense.

08:50.005 --> 08:52.216
Speaking of morons...

08:53.217 --> 08:55.010
Don't be late, "braino".

09:22.830 --> 09:24.998
Please take a seat
in every other row.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.792
Leave an empty desk between you.

09:28.794 --> 09:31.671
I don't want anyone
sharing your answers with you.

09:31.672 --> 09:35.174
I get enough long answers without
a lot of unnecessary duplication.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.634
What do you care?

09:36.635 --> 09:38.594
You don't even grade
'em yourself anyway?

09:38.595 --> 09:41.806
It's a moral responsibility
I have for you, my friend.

09:41.807 --> 09:44.727
After the examination, I'll
explain the term morality to you.

09:45.811 --> 09:48.272
Never mind.

09:49.523 --> 09:52.483
Oh, I'd love to go
on talking like this,

09:52.484 --> 09:53.568
but I must warn you.

09:53.569 --> 09:57.321
Your quiz isn't getting any shorter,
and your examination period is.

09:57.322 --> 09:59.073
Then let us at it.

09:59.074 --> 10:01.534
I should remind you you're
on the modified honor system.

10:01.535 --> 10:02.827
I'll be leaving the room,

10:02.828 --> 10:05.496
and the grading assistants
will be watching you.

10:05.497 --> 10:09.167
And they are both frustrated Nazis.

10:09.168 --> 10:12.712
And if they observe any cheating,
they have been instructed to alert

10:12.713 --> 10:17.383
a highly skilled sniper that I've
placed in the Williams Tower.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.470
He was a gun bearer for the
eagle scout down in Texas.

10:20.471 --> 10:23.514
You mean Charles Whitman,
one of my favorites.

10:23.515 --> 10:26.934
And he's anxious to bag
a few students on his own.

10:26.935 --> 10:28.102
Are there any questions?

10:28.103 --> 10:31.272
He was a real craftsman,
an excellent shot.

10:31.273 --> 10:33.775
And he played it out
to the bitter end.

10:33.776 --> 10:36.277
This guy was dropping
people from blocks...

10:36.278 --> 10:39.864
I hate to interrupt you
on such a lovely note.

10:39.865 --> 10:41.324
But back to business.

10:41.325 --> 10:44.119
Hey!
This ain't the test I been studying.

10:45.662 --> 10:47.246
Well, if you're
gonna buy tests,

10:47.247 --> 10:49.165
you might as well buy them
from somebody who's in the know.

10:49.166 --> 10:53.294
I'm perfectly willing to be
bought if the price is right.

10:53.295 --> 10:56.047
Good luck.
Oh, and don't worry.

10:56.048 --> 10:58.217
I took the test,
and I only missed three.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.219
Have a nice holiday.

11:01.220 --> 11:05.640
And I'll be seeing many of you
back here next semester

11:05.641 --> 11:07.893
in remedial chemistry.

11:09.853 --> 11:12.396
All right. Everybody settle
down and get to work.

11:12.397 --> 11:14.774
I think you've got enough problems
there in front of you without having

11:14.775 --> 11:16.651
to worry about running out of time.

11:16.652 --> 11:18.945
When you finish,
give your paper to one of us

11:18.946 --> 11:21.240
and then you may
leave quietly.

11:23.158 --> 11:24.325
- Hello, Lisa.
- Hi.

11:24.326 --> 11:26.702
- Ready to end the semester?
- Yeah.

11:26.703 --> 11:29.539
I've just about OD'd
on the small town lark.

11:29.540 --> 11:31.916
I'm really ready for
bright lights for awhile.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.876
I remember when I wanted that too.

11:33.877 --> 11:36.087
A little booze, boogie
and then puke your guts out.

11:36.088 --> 11:37.338
That's fun.

11:37.339 --> 11:39.423
I'm not so sure
you're too much beyond that now.

11:39.424 --> 11:43.094
Well, that's the nicest thing
anyone said to me in a long time.

11:43.095 --> 11:45.638
Those kids they
hate taking chemistry.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.723
At least it's new to them.

11:47.724 --> 11:50.643
For me, it's the same old
thing year in, year out.

11:50.644 --> 11:52.895
And then if I do get them to
understand and they graduate,

11:52.896 --> 11:55.398
then I have to start all over again.

11:55.399 --> 11:57.275
Then why don't ya leave?

11:57.276 --> 12:01.822
Because I love the sweet young
girls that throw themselves at me.

12:02.906 --> 12:04.615
Why pull down the shades?

12:04.616 --> 12:07.577
There's nobody left on
campus that we're fooling.

12:07.578 --> 12:09.745
You don't think
I'll kiss and tell, do you?

12:09.746 --> 12:11.582
No.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.751
But I do.

12:16.211 --> 12:18.754
I don't care who knows around here.

12:18.755 --> 12:22.216
But if that red-headed
wife of mine ever finds out,

12:22.217 --> 12:24.135
I'm dead.

12:24.136 --> 12:28.347
So, how about a
little night cap tonight?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.558
Oh, I don't know.

12:30.559 --> 12:34.271
It's your last chance for
some nice firm flesh for awhile.

12:36.273 --> 12:38.816
I leave in the
morning for the big city,

12:38.817 --> 12:42.571
and you're gonna be left with nothing
but that sagging old wife of yours.

12:44.573 --> 12:47.033
She must be almost 30 by now?

12:47.034 --> 12:48.326
Hey, wait a minute.

12:48.327 --> 12:49.887
You're talking about
the woman that I...

12:50.913 --> 12:52.914
Well, mother of my guppies?

12:52.915 --> 12:55.958
Uh-huh, and you love it.

12:55.959 --> 13:01.172
So, it's tonight or who
knows when, hot shot.

13:01.173 --> 13:03.424
How about here and now?

13:03.425 --> 13:05.509
Uh-uh. Sorry.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.511
This is final examination week.

13:07.512 --> 13:11.432
Pop quizzes just won't do.

13:11.433 --> 13:14.435
Tonight, meet me in
my rehearsal room.

13:14.436 --> 13:18.189
And we'll go
upstairs to the art studio.

13:18.190 --> 13:21.108
Art in the dark can be very tactile.

13:21.109 --> 13:23.319
Yeah, I like it.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.073
Studying form and texture.

14:01.066 --> 14:02.942
Oh!

14:02.943 --> 14:04.360
I can't help it.

14:04.361 --> 14:05.529
I'm brilliant.

14:09.199 --> 14:12.160
And I can't help
it because I'm offensive.

14:21.211 --> 14:22.838
I got better things to do.

14:26.717 --> 14:28.343
I'd like an A, please.

14:58.707 --> 15:01.042
Oh!

15:01.043 --> 15:02.084
Coach!

15:02.085 --> 15:04.754
You weren't ready, Wildman.

15:04.755 --> 15:06.672
One of these days you
are gonna get yours.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.592
Uh-uh.
You see, I'll be ready.

15:09.593 --> 15:11.761
That's why I'm the teacher,
and you're just a student.

15:11.762 --> 15:13.763
- Hi, Coach.
- Hey, Radish.

15:13.764 --> 15:15.806
When you gonna do your
equipment inventory?

15:15.807 --> 15:17.850
You know we've got a lot of
our good stuff checked out

15:17.851 --> 15:19.185
that didn't come back in yet.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.519
Well, I was planning...

15:20.520 --> 15:24.440
Well, ya see, we don't get much
in the way of athletes around here.

15:24.441 --> 15:26.192
And I got to take a
little pride in somethin'.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.277
You don't think some of
the guys are sneaking off

15:28.278 --> 15:30.447
to try and get in shape, do ya?

15:32.324 --> 15:33.657
They're not stealing the weights,

15:33.658 --> 15:36.660
running the tracks at night
like they could be.

15:36.661 --> 15:39.872
But now if everybody did that,
see I wouldn't have no job.

15:39.873 --> 15:42.708
Wouldn't be nobody around
here for me to holler at.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.628
Oh, look Coach. I got to go.
I'll talk to ya later.

15:45.629 --> 15:48.339
I'll get on that inventory,
Coach, right away.

15:48.340 --> 15:51.133
I got one more exam,
but it's under control.

15:51.134 --> 15:52.636
See ya later.

16:07.526 --> 16:09.276
Hi, guys.

16:09.277 --> 16:11.695
Hey, you two look like
you're never coming back.

16:11.696 --> 16:13.572
Well, it really
depends on our grades.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.242
You never know.

16:18.203 --> 16:19.829
- Have a good break.
- Yeah, y'all too.

16:19.830 --> 16:21.748
- Yeah. You too.
- Bye bye.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.551
Oh my God!

16:33.552 --> 16:35.011
Look out!

16:37.556 --> 16:39.182
I can't believe it!

16:50.610 --> 16:52.863
What in the world
is going on out there?

17:16.261 --> 17:17.846
Lisa! Look!

18:09.481 --> 18:10.898
Operator!
This is an emergency!

18:10.899 --> 18:12.442
Get me the Sheriff!

18:18.823 --> 18:21.742
This is Lanier College calling.

18:21.743 --> 18:24.537
There's been a multiple
shooting on the campus quadrangle!

18:24.538 --> 18:26.413
Listen!

18:26.414 --> 18:29.375
Several students have been shot
and kidnapped in a brown van!

18:29.376 --> 18:31.961
You've got to get out here!
It's happening!

18:31.962 --> 18:33.421
The psychopaths are here!

18:37.467 --> 18:39.677
Did you see that?
It was horrible!

18:39.678 --> 18:41.220
They shot at us!
It was murder!

18:41.221 --> 18:42.596
Cold-blooded murder and kidnapping!

18:42.597 --> 18:44.431
I almost got killed and
some other people were shot!

18:44.432 --> 18:46.725
How can you be laughing?
Didn't you see what happened?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.352
Yes, I saw it!

18:48.353 --> 18:51.313
But I also saw that the van had
a Gamma fraternity sticker

18:51.314 --> 18:53.315
on the back window!

18:53.316 --> 18:54.901
Oh.

19:03.368 --> 19:07.122
All right! All right!
The Alpha Gamma strikes again!

19:13.587 --> 19:15.964
What are Gammas?
What are Gammas?

19:28.893 --> 19:31.770
Boy, they sure did fool me.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.148
I should've known it
was a fraternity prank.

19:34.149 --> 19:37.443
Well, I wouldn't have known
either until I saw Wildman's van.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.320
It wasn't very smart.

19:39.321 --> 19:41.698
Neither is Wildman.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.248
I don't know what
looks the least dangerous today.

19:51.249 --> 19:52.583
Me either.

19:52.584 --> 19:54.877
You know, I've never seen
this place so empty before.

19:54.878 --> 19:58.380
I wonder if everybody else
knows something that we don't.

19:58.381 --> 20:00.842
Yeah, they know better then
to have exams on the last day.

20:01.885 --> 20:03.469
Everybody's gone home.

20:03.470 --> 20:07.181
I can't wait!
One lousy recital, and I'm off, too.

20:07.182 --> 20:09.683
Can't wait to see some new faces.

20:09.684 --> 20:11.644
Eat in a real restaurant.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.688
Hear some live music.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.194
You want to sit here?

20:20.195 --> 20:21.738
Sure.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.574
Uh-oh.
Look who's coming.

20:25.575 --> 20:27.701
Hello, gorgeous.

20:27.702 --> 20:30.287
I think this one's for you.

20:30.288 --> 20:32.164
Say, did you girls go
to the shooting today?

20:32.165 --> 20:33.374
Very funny.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.918
Were you responsible for
that little display outside?

20:35.919 --> 20:37.711
You're the leader
of all that rabble.

20:37.712 --> 20:38.962
Not me.

20:38.963 --> 20:40.547
I was at the
chemistry test, remember?

20:40.548 --> 20:42.216
Uh-huh.

20:42.217 --> 20:45.386
- The perfect alibi.
- Oh.

20:45.387 --> 20:49.557
Say, by the way, when are we
going on that midnight ride?

20:51.601 --> 20:53.852
Well, hey big boy.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.313
How about never?

20:57.399 --> 20:58.941
Well, everyone likes
to ride in my car,

20:58.942 --> 21:00.943
but what's the matter with you?

21:00.944 --> 21:02.653
- Not a thing.
- Well, hi Janet.

21:02.654 --> 21:05.781
For me, it's not my
first time in a fast car.

21:05.782 --> 21:08.951
I can't believe y'all
did that this afternoon.

21:08.952 --> 21:12.038
No wonder the Gamma House
is always on probation.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.541
Hello, pledge.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.418
Hello, sir.

21:17.419 --> 21:19.294
You know, I've been looking for you.

21:19.295 --> 21:23.173
There's some special duties
that need to be assigned.

21:23.174 --> 21:25.384
I'm really up against the
wall tomorrow at psych exam.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.512
We can do it later, can't we?

21:29.222 --> 21:33.684
Are you refusing the
small request of a brother?

21:33.685 --> 21:35.060
No, sir.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.188
Did I hear you right, pledge?

21:38.982 --> 21:40.692
Let's step outside.

21:45.155 --> 21:47.239
He probably needs his
car waxed.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.075
Well, I hope they don't bother Gary.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.411
He's very sensitive.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.080
When are you going to realize you
don't have to fall in love with

21:55.081 --> 21:57.500
somebody just to get a kiss?

21:59.753 --> 22:03.422
So, the prank went really well, huh?

22:03.423 --> 22:05.340
Sure, yeah.

22:05.341 --> 22:07.468
I mean it worked out
really well, I didn't it?

22:07.469 --> 22:10.471
Absolutely.
Right on schedule.

22:10.472 --> 22:12.765
You know, it was a great idea, sir.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.392
Not only a great idea.

22:15.393 --> 22:18.145
It was a great diversion,
and I made my 82.

22:18.146 --> 22:19.646
Great diversion.

22:19.647 --> 22:22.775
You know something?
I've got another great idea.

22:22.776 --> 22:26.153
You might be ready
for the big league.

22:26.154 --> 22:27.488
Initiation?

22:27.489 --> 22:28.947
No, well...

22:28.948 --> 22:30.783
Well, I'm proud
to be a Gamma pledge, sir.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.075
I mean, we're the best on campus.

22:32.076 --> 22:33.702
That's what I like to hear.

22:33.703 --> 22:37.915
Look, each semester, one pledge is
chosen to perform the solemn duty.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.416
Yeah?

22:39.417 --> 22:41.418
And this semester,
you've been chosen, pledge.

22:41.419 --> 22:43.754
- That's good, isn't it?
- Ls it good? It's excellent!

22:43.755 --> 22:45.798
Look, I want you to break into
Dr. Mahern's office

22:45.799 --> 22:48.175
and steal tomorrow's test for me.

22:48.176 --> 22:50.427
You've got to be kidding me, right?

22:50.428 --> 22:52.679
- No.
- I mean, I'm not crazy, sir.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.681
I could get kicked out
of school for doing that.

22:54.682 --> 22:57.601
We all do it, pledge.
We've done it.

22:57.602 --> 22:59.728
But this time, it's your turn.

22:59.729 --> 23:01.313
I can't do that, sir.

23:01.314 --> 23:03.233
Hey, Gammas!

23:06.069 --> 23:08.696
That was great!
What a stunt!

23:11.574 --> 23:13.326
Yeah! We were great!
Weren't we?

23:14.244 --> 23:15.745
Wildman.

23:16.955 --> 23:18.580
We've got a little problem.

23:18.581 --> 23:22.167
This pledge doesn't want
to steal the exam for us.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.169
Oh!

23:24.170 --> 23:27.798
Does he want his
brothers to have to study?

23:27.799 --> 23:32.219
- It's not that, Wildman.
- Pledge, pledge.

23:32.220 --> 23:36.557
I want that test by 9:00 tonight.

23:36.558 --> 23:38.100
All you have to do is
jump over the door,

23:38.101 --> 23:39.643
and you're out in 30 seconds.

23:39.644 --> 23:40.894
I don't know if it's
gonna be that easy.

23:40.895 --> 23:43.522
Oh pledge!
Listen, listen.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.190
You think about it.

23:45.191 --> 23:49.112
And I think you're gonna
find out that it's real easy.

23:51.739 --> 23:53.241
Bye.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.620
He'll do it.

23:59.247 --> 24:01.374
Oh, like a maniac.

24:02.250 --> 24:03.751
Let's go.

24:11.509 --> 24:14.970
I should've had a salad
instead of this spaghetti.

24:14.971 --> 24:17.389
Well, why didn't you?

24:17.390 --> 24:20.684
Hi.

24:20.685 --> 24:22.185
- Well?
- What?

24:22.186 --> 24:23.687
What did he want?

24:23.688 --> 24:26.023
It's fraternity business.
I can't tell you.

24:26.024 --> 24:27.774
Another secret?

24:27.775 --> 24:30.652
I hate all these silly secrets!

24:30.653 --> 24:33.155
I know you do, Janet,
but it's a lot of fun.

24:33.156 --> 24:34.990
Well, do you think it's
much fun for me to sit here

24:34.991 --> 24:36.325
and eat lunch without you?

24:36.326 --> 24:38.368
No, of course not.

24:38.369 --> 24:41.204
Well, it isn't like
it's the first time, Gary.

24:41.205 --> 24:44.291
Yeah, I know.
And I'm sorry.

24:44.292 --> 24:45.584
It's okay.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.503
Uh-oh.
Time to go.

24:48.504 --> 24:50.381
You want to hear a secret?

24:51.758 --> 24:53.884
What?

24:53.885 --> 24:56.888
I don't want to tell you in here
in front of all these people, silly.

25:01.059 --> 25:03.352
Well, I got to go study.

25:03.353 --> 25:05.188
I'll see you guys later.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.397
Oh! Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

26:30.398 --> 26:32.066
It's okay.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.680
All right.

27:03.681 --> 27:05.183
What's going on out here?

27:06.517 --> 27:08.810
We was told there was a shooting.

27:08.811 --> 27:11.563
Multiple shootings at that.

27:11.564 --> 27:17.152
We better find a multiple shooting
or somebody is gonna wish that

27:17.153 --> 27:20.822
a multiple shooting was
all the troubles he had.

27:20.823 --> 27:22.240
Now, who called?

27:22.241 --> 27:25.160
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding, Sheriff.

27:25.161 --> 27:28.955
We've all been the victim
of a harmless college prank.

27:28.956 --> 27:31.041
You call me?

27:31.042 --> 27:34.044
We got all our calls on tape
so you might as well admit it.

27:34.045 --> 27:35.962
I didn't deny that I called you.

27:35.963 --> 27:38.799
I thought it was real.
It could've been.

27:38.800 --> 27:42.719
I mean, senseless murders
are a modern phenomena.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.639
Can I help it if people are crazy?

27:45.640 --> 27:47.849
These type of murders
happen all the time.

27:47.850 --> 27:51.228
Oh, they happen,
but not in my county.

27:51.229 --> 27:52.979
And not on my supper time.

27:52.980 --> 27:56.024
Suppose you tell me about it.

27:56.025 --> 28:03.448
Well, a group of masked perpetrators
simulated a terrorist style raid

28:03.449 --> 28:08.203
in which several co-conspirators
pretended injury or death.

28:08.204 --> 28:10.540
It's not my fault.

28:14.168 --> 28:15.836
Where'd you learn to talk like that?

28:15.837 --> 28:18.256
Watching "Dragnet".

28:20.758 --> 28:23.051
Anybody recognize 'em?

28:23.052 --> 28:24.928
Or their car?

28:24.929 --> 28:27.722
Oh yeah, it was a brown van.

28:27.723 --> 28:30.642
Fortunately, I got
the license number.

28:30.643 --> 28:33.271
Why didn't you tell me?
Let me have that.

28:40.862 --> 28:43.738
Jesse, this is Sheriff calling.

28:43.739 --> 28:46.909
Listen, can you give me a
rundown on a brown van?

28:49.162 --> 28:54.416
License number MPM112.

28:54.417 --> 28:56.085
<i>10-4.</i>

28:57.920 --> 29:00.380
Where you going, bulldog?

29:00.381 --> 29:03.175
I got a exam.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.802
It'll wait.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.180
<i>Vehicle's registered
to John Chandlis</i>

29:08.181 --> 29:09.764
<i>of Shelby, North Carolina.</i>

29:09.765 --> 29:12.517
<i>No outstanding warrants.
He's clean, Sheriff.</i>

29:12.518 --> 29:13.978
<i>Out.</i>

29:20.276 --> 29:24.030
Anybody know a John Chandlis?

29:28.242 --> 29:30.744
Is that your daddy, bulldog?

29:30.745 --> 29:34.080
Actually, Sheriff,
he didn't kill anybody.

29:34.081 --> 29:37.834
I mean, it was a...
it was just a joke.

29:37.835 --> 29:40.629
There's about 50
laws that he did break,

29:40.630 --> 29:44.633
one of which was getting me to ride
all the way out here for nothing.

29:44.634 --> 29:47.802
But I guess I could run
this bird in on that one.

29:47.803 --> 29:49.930
Well, I'm sure
nobody meant any harm.

29:49.931 --> 29:55.852
I mean, sometimes students
just have to let off a little steam.

29:55.853 --> 29:57.687
Hello there, Quinton.

29:57.688 --> 29:59.689
Get yourself some criminals here?

29:59.690 --> 30:02.859
Didn't you hear about
that multiple shooting?

30:02.860 --> 30:04.402
Did these guys do it?

30:04.403 --> 30:07.030
I thought it was pretty funny
myself, didn't you?

30:07.031 --> 30:09.157
Bulldog here was in on it.

30:09.158 --> 30:11.618
But you know I think I'm
gonna take 'em all in.

30:11.619 --> 30:13.245
Maybe bust a few heads.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.830
Now, Quinton,
that don't sound like you.

30:15.831 --> 30:18.917
You used to enjoy a good time
until you got so full of yourself.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.502
That's a little different.

30:20.503 --> 30:24.965
But now, I do remember a time
when the library caught on fire,

30:24.966 --> 30:27.550
and somebody hid the fire
hose from the fire department.

30:27.551 --> 30:30.262
You guys sat around
drinking beer all night,

30:30.263 --> 30:33.307
chanting, "Damn good fire" until
the place burnt down to the ground.

30:34.308 --> 30:35.725
Oh now, you think
that's funny, don't ya?

30:35.726 --> 30:37.978
You think that's funny?

30:37.979 --> 30:39.396
Well, we'll just see!

30:39.397 --> 30:41.481
'Cause one of these days you
boys are gonna be in trouble,

30:41.482 --> 30:45.568
and I am going to be
there to take you home!

30:45.569 --> 30:48.656
See, these boys are
looking at a bad end.

30:55.079 --> 31:00.917
Bulldog, me and you gonna lock
horns again one of these days.

31:00.918 --> 31:05.673
And when we do,
you gonna get one phone call.

31:08.092 --> 31:12.638
Don't you lose this
dime 'cause if you do,

31:14.974 --> 31:19.269
ain't nobody ever
gonna here from you again.

31:19.270 --> 31:23.106
Hey there, Sheriff.
What do you need?

31:23.107 --> 31:25.817
Well, every thing's under
control around here, Sheriff.

31:25.818 --> 31:29.279
Now you know good and well
that I'm holding up my end.

31:29.280 --> 31:34.075
And there's not one bit of
crime on this whole campus.

31:34.076 --> 31:35.745
Not yet.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.188
I gotta get to work.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.356
Hey, Coach.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.066
We still going
hunting in the morning?

32:06.067 --> 32:07.776
Not if you've been drinking, Mitch.

32:07.777 --> 32:09.944
Now you know that I
don't hunt with no boozer.

32:09.945 --> 32:11.279
Well, I don't either.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.822
Coach!

32:12.823 --> 32:14.366
When you gonna
put away them toys?

32:14.367 --> 32:17.577
You know that bull hunting's
only for Indians and moonshiners!

32:17.578 --> 32:20.038
When I get so old and ornery
that I can't hit nothing except

32:20.039 --> 32:28.039
with a scatter gun,
I'll give you a call.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.923
I got to get to work, boys.

32:29.924 --> 32:31.508
Hey, Coach.

32:31.509 --> 32:33.802
You can pick me up
down here at Moore Hall,

32:33.803 --> 32:35.720
and I'm gonna clock out
now at sun up, ya hear?

32:35.721 --> 32:37.264
We'll see.

33:13.134 --> 33:14.968
Are you still at it?

33:14.969 --> 33:16.136
Yeah.

33:16.137 --> 33:18.680
I want to get a good grade.

33:18.681 --> 33:19.931
Why?

33:19.932 --> 33:21.975
Is that so bad?

33:21.976 --> 33:26.272
No, but once you get out of school,
nobody cares what your grades were.

33:31.277 --> 33:34.654
The important thing to know
is how to get what you want.

33:34.655 --> 33:36.364
That's what'll help you later on.

33:36.365 --> 33:37.407
Not grades.

33:37.408 --> 33:39.367
Yeah, but good grades can't hurt.

33:39.368 --> 33:41.244
Neither can good times.

33:41.245 --> 33:43.496
I'd rather know how to flirt.

33:43.497 --> 33:47.876
One thing's for sure, you'll
never catch me studying chemistry.

33:47.877 --> 33:51.171
Not while there's a man teaching it.

33:51.172 --> 33:52.590
Watch!

33:53.632 --> 33:57.343
Hi. Excuse me.
Could one of you give me a hand?

33:57.344 --> 33:59.305
Sure.

34:01.098 --> 34:02.557
Oh, thanks.

34:02.558 --> 34:04.517
I just wanted to carry these
down to my car

34:04.518 --> 34:06.936
so I didn't have to
do it in the morning.

34:06.937 --> 34:08.855
Are you sure you don't mind?

34:08.856 --> 34:10.483
No.

34:15.905 --> 34:17.362
No, No.

34:17.364 --> 34:19.366
Oh, okay.
Thank you.

34:21.869 --> 34:23.704
See how easy it is?

34:31.378 --> 34:34.590
I just don't know what I
would've done without you boys.

34:59.323 --> 35:01.950
Hi, Radish.

35:01.951 --> 35:03.785
Do you have any aspirin?

35:03.786 --> 35:06.162
Sure.

35:06.163 --> 35:09.208
I've been reading so
long that my brain hurts.

35:12.836 --> 35:14.380
What's the matter?

35:17.967 --> 35:20.760
Oh, life.

35:20.761 --> 35:22.887
It's just not fair.

35:22.888 --> 35:26.140
No, but at least it's
not fair to everybody.

35:26.141 --> 35:28.977
Or is that a paradox?

35:28.978 --> 35:31.938
You know some people
have it so much easier.

35:31.939 --> 35:34.691
You mean Lisa?

35:34.692 --> 35:36.693
Is it that obvious?

35:36.694 --> 35:38.820
It's only logical.

35:38.821 --> 35:42.031
You're living with
a girl that has a free ride.

35:42.032 --> 35:45.493
It looks easy, but she'll
pay a price sooner or later.

35:45.494 --> 35:47.495
There is no free brunch.

35:47.496 --> 35:50.373
I'm not jealous.

35:50.374 --> 35:53.751
Well, not the bad kind of jealousy.

35:53.752 --> 35:57.922
But it's just so easy for her.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.674
I guess that's what I resent.

35:59.675 --> 36:01.593
It's natural.

36:01.594 --> 36:04.429
- Well, I like Lisa.
- I know.

36:04.430 --> 36:07.056
It's not her fault.

36:07.057 --> 36:08.766
But I just don't know what
I'm gonna be able to do

36:08.767 --> 36:10.435
when I get out of school.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.145
And she can get
anything that she wants.

36:12.146 --> 36:13.187
Okay. Okay.

36:13.188 --> 36:17.442
She knows how to use
what she's got, but well,

36:17.443 --> 36:19.068
you have different qualities.

36:19.069 --> 36:21.654
You men have it so easy.

36:21.655 --> 36:23.072
You know what
you want from the beginning,

36:23.073 --> 36:25.158
and you can just go
right out there and get it.

36:25.159 --> 36:28.704
Yeah. Right.
I want to be on a SWAT team.

36:30.664 --> 36:33.708
I sound like a silly girl, don't I?

36:33.709 --> 36:35.585
I'm sorry.

36:35.586 --> 36:37.338
Thanks for the aspirin.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.675
You don't sound silly to me.

37:24.968 --> 37:26.512
Lisa?

37:40.567 --> 37:42.194
Hmmm.

37:46.198 --> 37:47.658
Hi.

37:48.951 --> 37:51.077
Has anyone been in here?

37:51.078 --> 37:53.788
Um, no. Why?

37:53.789 --> 37:56.457
I don't know.

37:56.458 --> 38:00.461
Seems like some of my
things were moved around.

38:00.462 --> 38:02.631
I can't find the book
I was just reading.

38:05.634 --> 38:08.052
Well, is there
anything else missing?

38:08.053 --> 38:11.013
Oh, no, no. I didn't mean
anyone would steal.

38:11.014 --> 38:13.684
Doesn't it feel like to you
something's wrong around here?

38:16.770 --> 38:18.271
I don't think that was funny!

38:18.272 --> 38:19.939
Well, I don't either!

38:19.940 --> 38:22.025
You don't think I did that?

38:25.320 --> 38:27.155
But it was your book.

38:27.156 --> 38:29.491
Introduction to Abnormal Psychology.

38:31.326 --> 38:34.120
Oh, pardon me. I'm so glad
there's still somebody here.

38:34.121 --> 38:36.205
Guess what?
I've got a secret.

38:36.206 --> 38:37.457
It's just wonderful.

38:37.458 --> 38:39.041
Oh, I bet you're in love.

38:39.042 --> 38:42.086
No, of course not.
Well, I mean, sure I'm in love.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.546
But that's nothing new.

38:43.547 --> 38:45.339
It sure isn't.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.425
Not for you, princess.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.969
Anyway, it's better than that.
I can't tell you.

38:49.970 --> 38:51.637
It's a secret.

38:51.638 --> 38:53.347
Then why did you
burst in here yelling,

38:53.348 --> 38:54.849
"Hey! Guess what?"

38:54.850 --> 38:57.059
Because if you guess it,
I won't be telling a secret.

38:57.060 --> 38:59.103
- I bet it's Gary, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.063
- Really?
- That's great!

39:01.064 --> 39:02.774
Uh, that means you got pinned.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.108
Oh, you guessed.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.903
But please don't tell anybody!

39:06.904 --> 39:09.697
It really is a secret.
He'll kill me!

39:09.698 --> 39:11.657
Wait a minute!
He should be proud.

39:11.658 --> 39:13.117
He should want people to know.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.494
Well, it's not that.

39:14.495 --> 39:18.581
If his fraternity brothers find out,
they'll tree him and torture him.

39:18.582 --> 39:20.958
Well, he doesn't want
to go through that.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.252
How romantic.

39:23.253 --> 39:25.171
He must really love you.

39:25.172 --> 39:29.091
He just doesn't want to be tied
to a tree and covered with ice

39:29.092 --> 39:31.385
until I can rescue him!

39:31.386 --> 39:33.596
Personally, I think
it might be sexy.

39:33.597 --> 39:35.682
But you're not the
one covered in ice.

39:37.851 --> 39:40.269
Well, come on.
Let's see it.

39:40.270 --> 39:41.771
What?

39:41.772 --> 39:44.816
The pin, silly.
The thing you're so excited about.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.568
Oh.

39:48.779 --> 39:51.447
Oh my God!
I lost it.

39:51.448 --> 39:52.824
He's gonna kill me!

39:52.825 --> 39:54.075
Well are you sure you
pinned it on right?

39:54.076 --> 39:55.743
Gary did it.
He should know how.

39:55.744 --> 39:59.539
It's his pin.
He pinned it right on my sweater.

39:59.540 --> 40:01.040
I'll be he loved that.

40:01.041 --> 40:03.042
It's probably caught in your shirt.

40:03.043 --> 40:05.127
He's got to have the pin for the
pledge meetings or he's gonna be in

40:05.128 --> 40:07.756
real trouble with the brothers!

40:11.385 --> 40:13.469
It's not funny!

40:13.470 --> 40:14.887
Yes, it is!

40:14.888 --> 40:17.515
I found your pin right
where Gary pinned it.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.975
Turn around.

40:18.976 --> 40:20.560
Where was the sweater
when he pinned you?

40:20.561 --> 40:22.228
In your lap?

40:22.229 --> 40:24.565
It doesn't matter where it was!

40:27.067 --> 40:28.819
We're in love.

40:31.822 --> 40:33.866
Ooh, I think we were
a little too hard on her.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.963
Conference time four eyes.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.304
Come in, Igor.

40:56.305 --> 40:58.055
You know I'm not believing
you called the cops

40:58.056 --> 40:59.390
on the mighty house of Gamma.

40:59.391 --> 41:03.978
Giving that dumb Sheriff my
tag number was not a good idea.

41:03.979 --> 41:08.774
- Well, I didn't realize...
- Now, I have to kill you!

41:08.775 --> 41:11.110
Wildman, you shouldn't
perpetrate a crime

41:11.111 --> 41:13.905
unless you've considered
all the consequences.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.156
But don't feel bad.

41:15.157 --> 41:17.742
So many great crimes
are ruined by tiny slip ups.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.786
I'm talking about death!

41:20.787 --> 41:25.000
I'm talking about cold,
clammy, maggot infested death!

41:27.127 --> 41:28.961
Hey, that's enough, Wildman.
Come on.

41:28.962 --> 41:30.964
- Oh!
- Come on. Let's go.

43:22.534 --> 43:24.160
Bull's eye.

43:24.161 --> 43:26.079
That wasn't so bad after all.

44:12.542 --> 44:14.418
Hello, pledge.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.170
- How'd you do?
- Just fine.

44:16.171 --> 44:17.589
Is this it?

44:19.883 --> 44:22.259
You might be Gamma
material after all.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.845
If he makes it through night.

44:24.971 --> 44:26.555
Hey, I did it.
Now, let me go.

44:26.556 --> 44:27.932
I got to study, too, ya know?

44:27.933 --> 44:29.517
Sir!

44:29.518 --> 44:31.477
Sir.

44:31.478 --> 44:35.272
You know I'm afraid it's
not gonna be that simple.

44:35.273 --> 44:36.649
Now you want to be a Gamma?

44:36.650 --> 44:38.192
And you do!
You do!

44:38.193 --> 44:39.527
I do! I do!

44:39.528 --> 44:43.072
You're going to have to learn how
to abide by all the lofty ideals

44:43.073 --> 44:45.241
and traditions of our noble brother.

44:45.242 --> 44:48.036
Yeah, I know.
But I got to study too, sir.

44:49.830 --> 44:52.164
Well then where's your pledge pin?

44:52.165 --> 44:54.417
Oh!

45:09.057 --> 45:10.808
- Tie 'em up!
- Let me go!

45:10.809 --> 45:12.644
Get his clothes off!

45:15.272 --> 45:16.397
Let's get some water on him!

45:16.398 --> 45:17.940
And shaving cream!

45:17.941 --> 45:19.401
Hey!

45:21.403 --> 45:24.113
Get off me!

45:24.114 --> 45:25.739
- Woohoo!
- Let's get those ropes tied!

45:25.740 --> 45:28.117
- All right! All right!
- Let's get those ropes tied!

45:28.118 --> 45:30.744
Woohoo!

45:30.745 --> 45:32.621
Are you okay?

45:32.622 --> 45:34.833
Please someone
get me out of here!

45:38.044 --> 45:40.045
Yeah!

45:40.046 --> 45:41.840
Is it cold?

45:45.552 --> 45:47.678
Tell Janet to
get me out of here!

45:47.679 --> 45:49.388
I'll go get her!

45:49.389 --> 45:51.308
Tell her to hurry!

45:53.101 --> 45:54.476
Well, pledge.

45:54.477 --> 45:56.228
That's all there is to it.

45:56.229 --> 45:58.772
We just wanted to make sure
that you're really in love

45:58.773 --> 46:01.942
because we don't want any unhappy
romances at the Gamma house.

46:01.943 --> 46:03.445
I love her!
Really, I do!

46:05.655 --> 46:07.698
Let's set it on fire!

46:07.699 --> 46:09.950
We can't do that, Wildman.

46:09.951 --> 46:11.912
He's got his love
to keep him warm.

46:13.622 --> 46:14.830
Let's get back to the house.

46:14.831 --> 46:17.209
- Yeah!
- Woohoo!

46:25.050 --> 46:26.592
Has anyone seen Janet?

46:26.593 --> 46:28.552
- Uh-uh.
- It's really important.

46:28.553 --> 46:30.471
If you see her,
tell her they treed Gary.

46:30.472 --> 46:31.555
Poor thing.

46:31.556 --> 46:34.267
You know, she's supposed to
stay where someone can find her.

46:39.689 --> 46:42.024
Can I talk to you for a minute?

46:42.025 --> 46:44.277
Can't you see that I'm studying?

46:46.446 --> 46:48.072
<i>Janet'.</i>

46:48.073 --> 46:50.033
What's the matter with you?

46:52.327 --> 46:55.829
Hey, you were so
happy this afternoon.

46:55.830 --> 46:59.041
I'm still happy-

46:59.042 --> 47:01.418
It's just that I'm depressed.

47:01.419 --> 47:03.128
Well then, let's hear it.

47:03.129 --> 47:04.922
It's Gary.

47:04.923 --> 47:07.466
I'm starting to have doubts.

47:07.467 --> 47:09.718
Oh, you are?

47:09.719 --> 47:12.054
Well, that happens to everyone.
It'll work out.

47:12.055 --> 47:14.473
It's not that
I don't love him a lot.

47:14.474 --> 47:17.184
I've never loved anyone
so much since Johnny Wooker

47:17.185 --> 47:19.478
in the 10th grade.

47:19.479 --> 47:22.064
But it's just never
been so serious before.

47:22.065 --> 47:23.816
You're just pinned.

47:23.817 --> 47:27.486
It's not legal or anything.

47:27.487 --> 47:30.155
In fact, it's still a secret.

47:30.156 --> 47:33.450
Well, I may have gotten
a little carried away.

47:33.451 --> 47:37.162
I'm afraid, a few people
already know, too.

47:37.163 --> 47:39.415
Even so, it's just a pledge pin.

47:39.416 --> 47:41.667
It only means what you
and Gary want it to.

47:41.668 --> 47:44.461
Well then, why do they make
such a big deal out of it?

47:44.462 --> 47:47.131
They harass you to
death if they find out.

47:47.132 --> 47:51.635
Nobody ever did that in high school,
and I went steady with lots of guys.

47:51.636 --> 47:53.470
Yes, I know.

47:53.471 --> 47:56.682
I used to think
fraternities were cool.

47:56.683 --> 47:59.184
I'll tell you,
you're tied to a tree,

47:59.185 --> 48:01.938
and you just want to
finish him off right there.

48:04.024 --> 48:06.191
We can't do that.

48:06.192 --> 48:07.901
We wouldn't be able to abuse him!

48:07.902 --> 48:09.696
Hmmm.

48:10.947 --> 48:12.197
Without pledges, man,

48:12.198 --> 48:14.658
we'd have to go into town
and spend money for fun.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.369
Oh.

48:17.829 --> 48:18.329
Pledge!

48:22.292 --> 48:24.461
Gamma House.
Test or pills.

48:26.254 --> 48:28.631
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, we could get him.

48:31.176 --> 48:34.011
Yeah, but I've got to tell you
that during final exams

48:34.012 --> 48:36.264
prices rise with demand.

48:37.807 --> 48:39.600
Okay.

48:39.601 --> 48:41.436
I'll see you in an hour.

48:44.397 --> 48:46.732
You know where
we can get any speed?

48:46.733 --> 48:49.318
Oh, no.
I don't use that stuff.

48:49.319 --> 48:51.403
It keeps me awake.

48:51.404 --> 48:53.155
I know that, dummy.

48:53.156 --> 48:55.866
I mean, some people do study.

48:55.867 --> 48:57.785
We're out of pills!

48:57.786 --> 49:00.621
Nobody has any pills anymore!

49:00.622 --> 49:02.831
You realize we could make a killing?

49:02.832 --> 49:06.627
You know, I believe in
studying the old fashioned way,

49:06.628 --> 49:09.546
with stolen tests.

49:09.547 --> 49:14.385
Look, if we could find tests,
we could find pills.

49:14.386 --> 49:16.678
Don't they have any pills in
the Coach's training room?

49:16.679 --> 49:19.139
No! No!
Those are pain pills.

49:19.140 --> 49:20.808
Those didn't help me study.

49:20.809 --> 49:22.643
Well, who cares?

49:22.644 --> 49:25.687
If they give you a buzz,
so much the better.

49:25.688 --> 49:27.898
Look, you can get 'em.
Don't ya have a key?

49:27.899 --> 49:29.316
Yeah, I got a key
to the weight room.

49:29.317 --> 49:30.651
That's just to work out, though.

49:30.652 --> 49:33.363
I can't get into the pills
unless I break the door down.

49:37.409 --> 49:39.785
You got it.
Um-hum.

49:39.786 --> 49:41.870
Oh no! No! No!

49:41.871 --> 49:43.705
They'll know someone broke in!

49:43.706 --> 49:45.791
Remember our friend, Radish?

49:45.792 --> 49:48.961
We still owe him one.

49:48.962 --> 49:49.462
Oh! Oh!

49:53.466 --> 49:56.427
The more damage, the better.

49:56.428 --> 50:01.223
This looks like a job for Wildman!

50:01.224 --> 50:02.934
Woohoo!

50:09.858 --> 50:12.568
It's okay.

50:12.569 --> 50:14.404
Just relax.

50:17.073 --> 50:18.615
Relax a little more..

50:18.616 --> 50:20.826
You need to stop
talking to yourself.

50:20.827 --> 50:22.995
Jan will be here soon.

50:22.996 --> 50:26.248
Oh, please, Janet be here soon!

50:26.249 --> 50:28.460
That bitch is always late.

50:31.337 --> 50:34.047
Janet?

50:34.048 --> 50:36.008
Janet, is that you?

50:36.009 --> 50:37.926
Janet?

50:37.927 --> 50:40.220
Hello?

50:40.221 --> 50:42.431
Anybody, can you help me?
I'm freezing!

50:42.432 --> 50:45.476
- Over here.
- Oh, good Mitch.

50:45.477 --> 50:47.436
Untie me quick, okay?
I'm freezing!

50:47.437 --> 50:49.646
- I can't rightly do that.
- What?

50:49.647 --> 50:52.983
Working man just never
messes with tradition.

50:52.984 --> 50:54.818
Why you done
been treed there, boy!

50:54.819 --> 50:56.361
Yeah, I know!

50:56.362 --> 50:59.531
A man takes a woman.
He's got to pay that price.

50:59.532 --> 51:01.200
Come on, Mitch!
I'll pay ya anything!

51:01.201 --> 51:03.744
- Untie me!
- Pay me? With what?

51:03.745 --> 51:06.246
Your good looks?

51:06.247 --> 51:10.250
I can't untie you, but I
tell you what we can do.

51:10.251 --> 51:12.920
We can drink a toast to
that new woman of yours.

51:12.921 --> 51:14.881
Oh, good.

51:17.884 --> 51:22.430
You can have yours
on the rocks.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.224
You old fart!

51:25.225 --> 51:26.643
Janet McCordle!

51:29.103 --> 51:32.189
Janet, they treed Gary!

51:32.190 --> 51:34.191
Why didn't you ever pledge?

51:34.192 --> 51:36.902
I mean, I'm sure you could have.

51:36.903 --> 51:39.071
Well, of course, I could have.

51:39.072 --> 51:40.906
But I just don't like
their hazing and all.

51:40.907 --> 51:42.824
Well, yeah.

51:42.825 --> 51:44.535
But it's not always so bad.

51:44.536 --> 51:47.037
Okay.
Maybe not always.

51:47.038 --> 51:49.122
But last year,
a girl killed herself

51:49.123 --> 51:51.458
because a sorority
wouldn't accept her.

51:51.459 --> 51:54.336
How awful!

51:54.337 --> 51:56.171
Which sorority?

51:56.172 --> 52:00.968
She jumped from the top of
McWilliams Tower six floors!

52:00.969 --> 52:03.387
Well, I bet it made
them feel terrible.

52:03.388 --> 52:05.639
That's the point, Janet.

52:05.640 --> 52:08.559
It doesn't matter
how bad they felt.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.477
It wasn't worth it.

52:10.478 --> 52:12.939
- Oh.
- Janet McCordle!

52:17.819 --> 52:20.488
Has anybody seen Janet McCordle?

52:21.322 --> 52:23.156
In here!
Courtney's room.

52:23.157 --> 52:24.908
Oh good, there you are.
I've been looking all over for you!

52:24.909 --> 52:25.909
They treed Gary.
You better go quick!

52:25.910 --> 52:27.244
He's probably dead by now!

52:27.245 --> 52:29.121
That's all so childish.

52:29.122 --> 52:30.998
I don't think I want
anything to do with it.

52:30.999 --> 52:32.708
What about poor Gary?

52:32.709 --> 52:35.794
Are you gonna leave
him out there all night?

52:35.795 --> 52:37.797
Well, that's his
silly old fraternity.

52:39.340 --> 52:41.842
I guess you're right.
I still love him.

52:41.843 --> 52:43.552
Good for you.
Go get 'em.

52:43.553 --> 52:45.846
Oh good!
Want to come too, Courtney?

52:45.847 --> 52:47.347
- Sure. I can go for that.
- No, no!

52:47.348 --> 52:49.933
Really, I want to do this by myself.

52:49.934 --> 52:52.811
I want to make it up to him
for going through all this.

52:52.812 --> 52:54.313
Sure.

52:54.314 --> 52:56.190
Just be gentle.

52:59.444 --> 53:01.278
- So what are you playing?
- Solitaire.

53:01.279 --> 53:03.489
- Oh, good.
- Elizabeth!

53:24.052 --> 53:26.595
Hello?

53:26.596 --> 53:29.473
Is anybody there?

53:29.474 --> 53:31.351
Can you help me?

53:32.393 --> 53:34.562
Come on, whoever you are.
Give me a break.

53:38.858 --> 53:40.692
Is that you, Mark?

53:40.693 --> 53:43.070
Wildman, don't you ever give up?

53:43.071 --> 53:45.406
What am I supposed to think
that you're the Gamma goblin?

53:48.576 --> 53:51.495
Janet? Terrific!

53:51.496 --> 53:55.040
That's right.
Get me off first and kiss me later!

53:55.041 --> 53:57.418
Hurry!
Cut the other rope!

54:18.272 --> 54:19.899
Janet?

54:21.734 --> 54:23.486
Where are you?

54:27.573 --> 54:29.199
Hello?

54:29.200 --> 54:31.118
Who's there?

54:31.119 --> 54:33.495
Hello?

54:33.496 --> 54:35.623
Is anybody there?

54:36.541 --> 54:37.916
That's a stupid question.

54:37.917 --> 54:39.711
Somebody's got to be there.

54:42.213 --> 54:43.756
Who is it?

54:45.007 --> 54:46.634
Ugh!

54:49.470 --> 54:51.222
Ugh!

55:20.001 --> 55:21.585
Yoohoo!

55:21.586 --> 55:23.337
Gary!

55:25.423 --> 55:27.675
Well, where are you?

55:29.469 --> 55:31.137
Gary?

55:46.277 --> 55:47.862
Gary?

55:49.113 --> 55:51.115
Gary, is that you?

55:52.909 --> 55:55.620
Gary? It's me!

56:13.387 --> 56:15.139
Gary.

56:16.224 --> 56:18.226
How did you get away?

56:25.942 --> 56:27.693
Gary.

56:28.736 --> 56:30.488
What's the matter?

56:38.079 --> 56:40.122
That is you, isn't it?

56:42.208 --> 56:43.876
Gary?

57:34.010 --> 57:34.510
Pills!

57:55.781 --> 57:57.867
Woohoo! Pills!

58:35.404 --> 58:37.156
Who's there?

58:41.702 --> 58:43.412
Hello?

58:46.707 --> 58:48.542
Who's there?

58:51.337 --> 58:53.130
Hello?

58:56.884 --> 58:58.552
Who's there?

59:02.556 --> 59:04.517
Stop screwing around!

59:16.862 --> 59:18.364
Ugh!

01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:48.370
He should've been back by now.

01:00:50.498 --> 01:00:54.626
You guys, go to your dorm,
and I'll go find Wildman.

01:00:54.627 --> 01:00:57.296
And I'll bring you
the pills personally, okay?

01:01:05.679 --> 01:01:08.389
Hi.

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:09.849
Are you drinking?

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:12.852
I always drink Irish whiskey
at the end of the term.

01:01:12.853 --> 01:01:15.606
Would you care to join
me in the celebration?

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.402
Oh!

01:01:21.403 --> 01:01:24.280
Well, that's terrible!
How can you drink that?

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:26.741
- Don't you ever lock your door?
- What could happen to me?

01:01:26.742 --> 01:01:29.244
Famous last words.

01:01:29.245 --> 01:01:31.788
Why are you so apprehensive?

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:34.207
When are you going to realize
that the whole world isn't made of

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:36.376
psychopaths skulking about?

01:01:36.377 --> 01:01:39.963
But they are out there.
They do exist.

01:01:39.964 --> 01:01:44.884
People are killed every
day for no reason at all.

01:01:44.885 --> 01:01:47.929
Perfect strangers wake up
in the morning and decide,

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:53.184
"Hmm... I think it's a good day
to snuff somebody."

01:01:53.185 --> 01:01:56.855
And there are people who eat
at our restaurants with us,

01:01:56.856 --> 01:01:59.899
use our highways and
vote for the President,

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.778
which probably explains
something about him, too.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.032
I'm not paranoid.
I'm just facing unhappy facts.

01:02:08.033 --> 01:02:09.993
Well, will you please stop it?

01:02:09.994 --> 01:02:12.495
Because I don't think it's
cute like some people might.

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:15.540
Hey, what's wrong with you?

01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:18.877
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.

01:02:18.878 --> 01:02:21.713
Everybody's gone home.
It just feels creepy.

01:02:21.714 --> 01:02:23.923
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

01:02:23.924 --> 01:02:25.550
Where's Lisa?

01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:27.719
Oh, out.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.556
Working on organic chemistry,
I suppose?

01:02:31.557 --> 01:02:33.057
Well, just like I told you.

01:02:33.058 --> 01:02:36.102
A pretty face and you can
have the world by the tail.

01:02:36.103 --> 01:02:38.229
She doesn't have to
study to make it.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:39.731
She can't lose.

01:02:39.732 --> 01:02:41.932
Well, I don't have to study
to make it either, you know?

01:02:43.027 --> 01:02:45.361
Why is it that you can
always make me laugh?

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:49.157
Um, I got to go do my
inventory for the Coach.

01:02:49.158 --> 01:02:51.701
- Tonight?
- Well, some time.

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:53.536
May as well be tonight.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:56.789
I've already mastered everything
I need for my exam tomorrow.

01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:59.667
Being brilliant has it's drawbacks.

01:02:59.668 --> 01:03:01.878
I'm bored.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:03.504
Just like you were
bored with the key club.

01:03:03.505 --> 01:03:05.173
I never said that.

01:03:05.174 --> 01:03:07.384
You didn't have to.

01:03:08.969 --> 01:03:11.512
Well, I got to go.

01:03:11.513 --> 01:03:12.805
Good luck on your test tomorrow.

01:03:12.806 --> 01:03:14.183
Thank you.

01:03:15.017 --> 01:03:16.768
Can I ask you something?

01:03:16.769 --> 01:03:18.395
Sure.

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:25.360
Do me a favor and lock the door.
I'll feel better.

01:03:25.361 --> 01:03:27.487
I'll feel better, too.

01:03:27.488 --> 01:03:29.782
It has been a little spooky lately.

01:03:45.172 --> 01:03:47.424
- Radish?
- Yeah.

01:03:52.471 --> 01:03:55.348
You have a pretty face, too.

01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:58.393
Prettier than Lisa, really.

01:03:58.394 --> 01:04:01.896
There's more there.

01:04:01.897 --> 01:04:04.190
I just wanted to tell ya that.

01:04:04.191 --> 01:04:06.110
Lock this door, too.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.907
That was stupid, kid.

01:04:12.908 --> 01:04:14.952
I can't believe you said that.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:53.240
Wildman.

01:04:53.907 --> 01:04:55.576
You here?

01:04:58.454 --> 01:05:00.497
Hey, it's just me, Mark.

01:05:24.897 --> 01:05:27.024
Well, I told him to
make it look good.

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:13.482
Hmm.

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:23.073
Aha!

01:08:23.075 --> 01:08:24.910
Shades of Watergate.

01:09:15.335 --> 01:09:16.794
Oh boy.

01:09:16.795 --> 01:09:18.880
You guys have really
done it this time.

01:09:32.394 --> 01:09:34.645
It's happening.
It's happening here.

01:09:34.645 --> 01:09:36.648
Police!
Call the police!

01:09:37.733 --> 01:09:39.234
Oh God.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.988
Operator!
This is an emergency!

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:46.992
Give me the Sheriff, please!

01:09:51.622 --> 01:09:52.747
<i>Sheriff here.</i>

01:09:52.747 --> 01:09:55.333
Sheriff, this is one of the
students from Lanier College

01:09:55.334 --> 01:09:56.959
from this afternoon.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.628
There's been another
murder at the college.

01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:00.546
I mean, not another
murder but a murder.

01:10:00.547 --> 01:10:02.798
And this time it's real.
There's a body.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.925
<i>Is this one of them
fraternity jokes?</i>

01:10:04.926 --> 01:10:07.094
No, sir!
It's not a joke!

01:10:07.095 --> 01:10:09.347
This is real!

01:10:09.348 --> 01:10:11.515
I know I thought the other one...!

01:10:11.516 --> 01:10:12.975
I know I thought the
other one was real,

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:16.437
but this... this is different!
There's a dead body right here!

01:10:16.438 --> 01:10:19.607
And some other weird
things are happening, too.

01:10:19.608 --> 01:10:21.692
- We need help, Sheriff.
- Call me in the morning.

01:10:21.693 --> 01:10:24.320
<i>- It's your job!
- You telling me my job, boy?</i>

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:27.198
No, sir!
I'm not trying to tell you your job.

01:10:27.199 --> 01:10:29.533
But somebody should.

01:10:29.534 --> 01:10:32.578
There's a murderer
killing people around campus.

01:10:32.579 --> 01:10:35.373
You should want to know about it!

01:10:35.374 --> 01:10:39.127
Look!
There's a guy here who is dead!

01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:44.882
And we could all be in danger.

01:10:44.883 --> 01:10:46.342
Fine!

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:48.345
I'll take charge myself then!

01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:52.224
Courtney!

01:11:59.249 --> 01:12:01.001
Charlie?

01:12:31.198 --> 01:12:34.034
Courtney! It's me, Radish!
Let me in! Courtney!

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.649
Wonderful.

01:13:09.194 --> 01:13:11.822
I'll give you art in the dark.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.633
Oh my God!

01:14:17.971 --> 01:14:20.139
Stop it, Radish!

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.850
That's not funny!

01:14:22.851 --> 01:14:25.145
I mean it! Come on!
You scared me to death!

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:32.903
Come on, Radish.

01:14:35.113 --> 01:14:37.115
I want you to move!

01:14:40.827 --> 01:14:42.662
Come on, smile!

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:50.754
Radish.

01:14:54.049 --> 01:14:55.717
Radish.

01:15:01.723 --> 01:15:03.390
Is anybody there?

01:15:03.391 --> 01:15:06.810
Somebody help me, please!

01:15:06.811 --> 01:15:09.271
Is anybody there?

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:11.775
Please, I need help!

01:15:14.152 --> 01:15:16.655
Is anybody there?

01:15:17.197 --> 01:15:19.239
Please, I need help!

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.159
Somebody please help me!

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:52.523
Is this the vision
you've been dreaming of?

01:15:52.524 --> 01:15:54.359
The masterpiece?

01:15:58.238 --> 01:16:01.157
I promised you form, texture.

01:16:04.744 --> 01:16:06.830
Mitch? Mitch!

01:16:07.998 --> 01:16:09.748
Mitch!

01:16:09.749 --> 01:16:12.209
Mitch! Mitch, wake up!

01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:16.214
Mitch, Radish has been killed!
He's dead! Wake up!

01:16:17.882 --> 01:16:20.051
Somebody got to do something!

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:22.554
Lisa!

01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:55.211
Lisa!

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.550
Dr. Reynolds!

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:04.637
Come on, you guys!
It's me, Courtney!

01:17:05.513 --> 01:17:07.432
Look, I know you're here!

01:17:16.524 --> 01:17:18.525
Lisa!

01:17:18.526 --> 01:17:20.278
Dr. Reynolds!

01:17:21.488 --> 01:17:24.448
Please, I need your help!

01:17:24.449 --> 01:17:27.659
This is important!

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.453
Come on!

01:17:29.454 --> 01:17:32.165
This is serious!
It's an emergency!

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:35.709
Come on, you guys!

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:37.461
Come out!
I know that you're here!

01:17:37.462 --> 01:17:39.464
Please!

01:17:41.299 --> 01:17:43.218
Lisa?

01:17:44.302 --> 01:17:46.136
Come on, both of you.

01:17:46.137 --> 01:17:47.847
Please!

01:18:55.707 --> 01:18:57.917
Uh!

01:20:06.945 --> 01:20:09.404
<i>This telephone
cannot dial numbers on campus.</i>

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:11.824
<i>Please check with the
campus operator for assistance.</i>

01:20:21.793 --> 01:20:24.003
Answer this phone!

01:20:55.827 --> 01:20:57.495
Ugh!

01:20:57.912 --> 01:20:58.412
No! No!

01:21:29.235 --> 01:21:31.529
Help me! Help!

01:22:48.648 --> 01:22:50.233
Hey, Mitch!

01:22:54.529 --> 01:22:57.031
Mitch! Time to go!
Come on!

01:23:17.301 --> 01:23:18.927
Help me!

01:23:18.928 --> 01:23:20.554
I'm up here!

01:23:20.555 --> 01:23:22.348
There's a killer up here!

01:23:41.242 --> 01:23:42.701
UP here!

01:23:42.702 --> 01:23:44.162
Help!

01:24:02.847 --> 01:24:05.098
All right, freeze!
Hold it right there!

01:24:05.099 --> 01:24:06.975
Make one more move
towards that girl,

01:24:06.976 --> 01:24:09.937
I swear I'm gonna hang
your head on my wall!

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.405
Ugh!

01:24:20.406 --> 01:24:22.283
No!

01:24:23.409 --> 01:24:27.997
<i>Help me! Please!</i>

01:24:30.917 --> 01:24:32.627

No!

01:24:54.565 --> 01:24:56.734
No! No!

01:25:00.363 --> 01:25:01.656
