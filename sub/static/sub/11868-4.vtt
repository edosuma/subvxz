00:05.797 --> 00:08.004
SARAH! Water.

00:08.133 --> 00:09.873
SARAH: Yes, Sheriff.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.959
(EXCLAIMING) Warm water!

00:12.095 --> 00:13.801
Sorry, Sheriff.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.714
(SQUIRTING AIR)

00:19.895 --> 00:21.101
Forget it.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.267
I sense a high level
of adrenaline in your system.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.439
Is something
bothering you today?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.274
I'm perfectly fine.

00:28.654 --> 00:32.067
High adrenaline can cause
physical and psychological
reactions.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.188
(GASPS)

00:34.284 --> 00:35.569
Bandage?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.323
I want to look good
at the wedding.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.195
Good thing you're
not the groom.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.034
What kind of Type A bride
works the morning
of her wedding?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.499
Nice cut.
Thanks.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.872
There is a condiment
dispenser in the refrigerator.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.839
Uh, that's all right.
I like the bottle.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.960
And, I don't know.
She called me up,
said she needed my help.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.462
So, you jumped,
like always.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.929
No, I didn't.

00:58.058 --> 01:03.223
Dad, you're walking the woman
you possibly love down the
aisle to marry another guy.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.062
Okay, first, not true,

01:06.191 --> 01:08.728
and, second, since when
do you and I talk
about this stuff?

01:08.860 --> 01:11.567
Since I'm 17,
and you're in denial.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.274
I'm fine.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.490
Are you really
this hopelessly
un-self—aware?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.365
That's my last clean shirt.
Yeah.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.910
(DOORBELL RINGING)
There's an unexpected
visitor at the door.

01:25.961 --> 01:26.916
lt's Auntie Lex!

01:27.045 --> 01:29.912
Three days early! Wow!

01:30.048 --> 01:31.003
Shall I let her in?

01:35.929 --> 01:36.918
Hello?

01:37.889 --> 01:39.425
(EXCLAIMS) Zoe!

01:39.558 --> 01:43.972
(GASPING) You look
like a supermodel.
Every father's nightmare.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.595
(CATS MEWING)
I love your hair,
and your cats.

01:46.732 --> 01:50.850
Hmm? Oh! A Tibetan monk
told me that tabby is a
reincarnation of Grandma Lil.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.859
Jackie!

01:52.988 --> 01:56.901
(GASPS) You look
just like Dad.
Always ready,

01:57.034 --> 02:00.401
Hey!
always prepared,
always uptight.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.119
(STUTTERING) I thought
you weren't coming
till Tuesday.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.115
My Seattle chakra conference
ended early,
and Saturday travel,

02:07.419 --> 02:11.128
Right. Well, glad to see you.
If you could put the cats
in the guest room,

02:11.256 --> 02:12.917
and I'll see you
at the wedding, sweetie.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.257
Nice to see you,
too, Monkey.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.467
Monkey?
Don't call me that!

02:17.596 --> 02:21.464
Weddings! I love weddings.
Okay, be careful with
Grandma, she's in heat.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.760
(CATS MEWING)
Mmm, mmm.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.179
CARTER: Shouldn't you be at
a beauty parlor or something?

02:25.312 --> 02:28.804
What? Is it 1960
and no one told me? Relax.
We've both done this before.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.191
I mean, separately,
but...

02:30.317 --> 02:34.686
Yeah, but getting married
isn't like riding a bike
or returning dry cleaning.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.358
I mean, getting married
should be

02:37.491 --> 02:38.446
momentous!

02:38.575 --> 02:40.315
Well, redaction is
momentous, too,

02:40.452 --> 02:41.988
but I owe it
to these people
to see them through it.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.371
Big day. Nervous?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.283
(LAUGHING) I'm not
a first-time bride.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.657
Sorry I had to call you in,
but quarterly balance sheets
are due Monday.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.080
This couldn't wait.
Another set
of layoffs?

02:51.213 --> 02:52.498
There's over
a dozen people here.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.206
Good thing you called
in the cavalry.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.884
Blood stain?
(STUTTERING) Oh, no,
breakfast.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.590
It's Saturday,
it's my last clean shirt,
so...

03:03.475 --> 03:04.510
This is gonna take hours.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.976
Time's a-wasting.
Wouldn't want to miss
your beautiful wedding.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.764
You didn't invite her,
did you?

03:12.901 --> 03:13.981
No.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.232
CARTER: Look, this whole
redaction thing sucks.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.902
I'd like to see the Fixer
cleaning up excrement.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.989
Look, Lincoln,
um, for what it's worth,

03:25.580 --> 03:27.366
we all know
that you're the best, um,

03:27.999 --> 03:29.500
excrement guy around.

03:31.086 --> 03:34.044
Just remember,
today at 6:00 pm,
your badge is disabled.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.172
I'm sorry.
I've been in Eureka
for eight years.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.712
Kinda hard to go back
to the PETCO in Pacoima,
you know?

03:39.845 --> 03:42.461
Yeah, well,
it's been a hard day
for a lot of good people.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.178
Carter! Bar fight?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.467
Take care.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.467
(CLEARING THROAT) Shouldn't
you be at the beauty parlor?
It is your big day.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.979
Supervising an important
delivery.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.345
Time-sensitive.
Guys!

03:51.481 --> 03:53.437
Do you need
something, Carter?
Guys?

03:53.942 --> 03:57.685
Yeah, I need to find, uh,
Maintenance. Last guy
on my list is, um...

03:58.655 --> 04:00.111
Uh, Weinbrenner.
Basement.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.980
Just do
whatever you have
to do, but, please,

04:02.117 --> 04:04.859
don't be late to the wedding,
and don't forget the necklace.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.781
(GROANING) I can't believe
she's marrying him again.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.950
(SlGHlNG) I can't believe
she asked him to walk her
down the aisle.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.675
Weinbrenner?
Leo Weinbrenner?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.845
Anyone here?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.600
(GROANING) Wow.

04:31.229 --> 04:35.142
(LAUGHING) All right.
You just bought yourself
an extra day.

04:50.081 --> 04:54.541
You're late.
Yeah, I had to redact 12
people, and then find a tie.

04:55.003 --> 04:55.788
The necklace?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.206
What necklace?

05:06.765 --> 05:08.972
One ofa kind,
just like Allie.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.811
Don't screw it up.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.850
You know, the French
give their children
wine with dinner.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.519
Yeah, well, Dad's never
been to France.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.358
Okay, if I told you
what your father
was doing at your age...

05:20.487 --> 05:21.442
He would kill you.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.232
(SNICKERS) That's
what aunts are for.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.571
(TOASTS IN FRENCH)

05:25.534 --> 05:26.523
Zoe!

05:27.452 --> 05:28.658
Nice, Lex.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.199
You're late.
I met your sister.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.744
Yeah, arrest her
for corrupting a minor.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.797
Wow.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.303
Momentous, huh?

05:50.058 --> 05:51.173
Yeah.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.516
Are you okay?
You look pale.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.055
That's the white tent.

05:57.315 --> 06:01.228
Allison, um,
there's something
that I wanted to say.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.770
Um, something
you should know.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.151
I'll always be
here for you,

06:09.160 --> 06:10.445
no matter what.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.579
Everything's gonna work out
the way it's supposed to.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.586
(CLASSICAL GUITARS
PLAYING WEDDING MARCH)

07:01.838 --> 07:03.203
Love is timeless,

07:03.590 --> 07:06.707
transcending
everything we know,
everything we understand,

07:06.843 --> 07:10.756
and giving us strength
and comfort forever.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.881
What is past is now present,

07:14.017 --> 07:16.804
and what is present
will become your future.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.521
That is what love is:
never-ending.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.391
Now, before you
share your vows,

07:25.487 --> 07:31.107
if there is anyone here
who knows why these two
should not be joined together,

07:31.409 --> 07:35.072
speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

(SlGHlNG) What the hell?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.589
Warm!
SARAH: Yes, Sheriff.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.815
I sense a high level
of adrenaline in your system.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.983
I'm fine, just
a weird dream.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.908
High adrenaline can cause
physical and psychological
reactions.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.125
Perfectly...

08:21.251 --> 08:22.240
Ow.

Yes, Sheriff?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.546
Is the wedding today?

08:29.676 --> 08:31.587
Yes, at 6:00 pm.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.044
Good thing
you're not the groom.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.672
Is something bothering you?
Yeah.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.217
Feels like I was
already there.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.363
Nice cut.
Why are you
dressed for work?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.535

Said she needed my help.

of her wedding?

Yeah, thanks.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.425
Dad, is something wrong?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.462
Yeah, I'm a little...
I'm a little thrown.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.632
Well, no wonder. I mean,
you're walking the woman
you possibly love

09:16.765 --> 09:18.676
down the aisle
to marry another guy.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.015
And since when do you and I
talk about that stuff, huh?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.430
Since I'm 17.
You're in denial.

visitor at the door.

How did you know?

09:35.241 --> 09:36.276
Shall I let her in?

Yes!

09:41.081 --> 09:42.287
Hello!

09:43.917 --> 09:48.707
(GASPS) Zoe! You look
like a supermodel,
every father's nightmare.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.625
You look amazing!
I love your hair.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.874
(CAT MEWING)
And your cats.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.965

Hey!
You look
just like Dad.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.889
(STUTTERING) And, uh,
your tabby looks
like Grandma Lil.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.471
I thought you were
coming on Tuesday?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.595
Oh, my Seattle chakra
conference ended early...

10:06.731 --> 10:09.473
And Geminis
travel best on Saturday.

10:09.984 --> 10:10.894
(LAUGHS)
Okay.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.609
If you could put the cats
in the guest room, I got to
figure something out.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.773
I'll see you at
the wedding.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.146
Wedding? I love
weddings!

10:17.075 --> 10:19.862
I can't explain it.
Ijust feel like
I've done all this before.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.076
(LAUGHS) We've both
done this before,
separately.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.491
No, not the wedding. I mean,
not just the wedding.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.536
It's the ketchup, my sister,
this conversation...

10:27.710 --> 10:28.836
Big day. Nervous?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.623
Oh, she's not
a first-time bride.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.373
I'm sorry to call you in.
These quarterly balance sheets
are due Monday.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.419
They can't wait.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.170
Another set of layoffs?
There's over a dozen
people on this.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.512
Good thing
you called in
the cavalry.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.972
Blood stain?
Uh, breakfast.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.886
Time's a-wasting.
Wouldn't want you to miss
your beautiful wedding.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.016
See? I knew she was
gonna say that.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.139
(SIGHS)

10:51.401 --> 10:53.858
You have to believe me.
I've done this before.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.650
Carter, no more advice.
This is gonna take hours.
If we don't start now,

10:57.782 --> 10:59.898
I'm gonna be late
to my own wedding.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.611
Guys?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.330
Carter! Bar fight?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.789
No. I got a problem.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.456
All right, Carter, look,
do what you have to do,
but just please,

11:12.589 --> 11:14.921
don't be late for the wedding,
don't forget the necklace.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.461
This isn't about the necklace.
Something's wrong with today.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.004
You walking Allie
down the aisle?

11:19.137 --> 11:21.799
This isn't about the wedding
or whether or not I think
it's a mistake.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.011
Ah! Now
it's a mistake.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.759
Yeah, um, we're supervising an
important delivery here, so...

11:28.104 --> 11:30.060
Yeah, you know,
so why don't I just
do it myself?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.931
Carter,
we're getting married.
She said yes.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.773
No, I know.
I felt it.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.689
I mean, I was there
the first time. Second...

11:36.821 --> 11:37.981
The first
second time.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.024
What is wrong with you?

11:39.157 --> 11:41.022
This isn't about
the wedding.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.649
This is about
time repeating.

11:42.785 --> 11:43.774
(SlGHlNG)

11:43.912 --> 11:45.903
I mean, can it happen?
A time loop? The same day,
over and over?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.197
No. Time flows
in one direction.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.621
If time were
to fold back upon itself,
it would affect causality.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.707
It would delete us from
the time-space continuum.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.788
(WHISPERS) Okay.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.165
Carter.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.880
It's Allie's big day.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.802
Don't screw it up.

12:02.972 --> 12:03.961
All right.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.799
The last time
I had moo goo gai pan,
I was in a hut in Canton.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.393
I thought we were
gonna get to meet
the future Mr. Lexi.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.477
Oh, he had, uh,
visa troubles.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.349
Duncan is her
gorgeous Dr. WHO.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.646
Oh, my God!
I love that show!

12:17.779 --> 12:20.395
Oh, no,
"World Health Organization."
He's an immunologist.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.567
(STAMMERING) Oh...
I knew that.

12:23.076 --> 12:23.861
ZOE: Hey, Dad.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.076
Hey! Um, did you see me
sleepwalking last night?

12:27.205 --> 12:29.241
Or talking?
Anything odd?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.698
Nice to see you,
too, Monkey.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.081
Don't call me that.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.453
Oh. He's just nervous
about the wedding.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.712
No, I'm not,
and don't call me that.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.004
Can I get
two banana milkshakes?
Bananas calm Monkey down.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.797
VINCENT: Coming right up.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.967
There have been
documented cases
of repetitive cognizance

12:47.100 --> 12:51.514
brought on
by extreme psychophobia
of a certain upcoming event.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.308
So, tell me,
what's my, uh,
psychophobia?

12:54.565 --> 12:57.227
Okay, uh, this Allison,

12:57.360 --> 12:58.770
Mmm.
you like her,

12:58.903 --> 12:59.858
right?
Yeah.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.855
Can't stand the thought
of her with another guy
forever?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.401
(EQUIVOCALLY)
Well, I mean...

13:05.660 --> 13:07.776
Okay, let's say

13:08.329 --> 13:09.865
I'm conflicted.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.946
Have you told her?

13:12.083 --> 13:15.371
Okay, there's your problem,
Sheriff "I'm-Not—a-Sharer."

13:15.503 --> 13:18.836
So I'm stuck in this day
until I tell her how I feel?

13:18.965 --> 13:22.002
Mmm, you can'tjust tell her.
You have to kiss her.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.428
It's the only way to know,
on a truly cellular level,

13:24.554 --> 13:26.636
if your energies
are meant to combine.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.015
There's a science
to this love stuff.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.427
But, you know, why start
taking my advice now?

13:30.560 --> 13:34.348
Honestly? Because you
are the only one
who believes me.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.847
That's what family's for.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.406
Carter! You can't
go in there.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.071
(EXHALES)
Carter...

13:49.412 --> 13:50.618
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:52.248 --> 13:53.909
Carter, you're early.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.953
Yeah, and you're...
Not ready.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.791
(GROANS)

13:58.880 --> 14:00.711
Are you okay?
You look pale.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.671
I'm not, uh,

14:04.052 --> 14:05.337
(STAMMERING)
a "sharer."

14:07.055 --> 14:08.044
(SlGHlNG)

14:08.973 --> 14:11.589
Hey. What is it?

14:19.942 --> 14:20.977
(SlGHlNG)

14:22.570 --> 14:25.027
So, you thought
that coming here
and doing that,

14:25.406 --> 14:27.943
right before the wedding,
that that's a good idea?

14:28.076 --> 14:30.783
No. My sister did.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.153
Look, I'm not
gonna deny that...

14:33.289 --> 14:34.574
That, you know, maybe...

14:34.707 --> 14:36.743
(STUTTERING) It just...
It didn't work out that way.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.374
(SOFTLY) I love Nathan.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.460
We have a history.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.253
And, and you and I
could've had a future...

14:43.383 --> 14:45.544
You'll always be
my friend.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.716
My true friend.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.676
I'll always be
here for you.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.263
You know that,
right?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.674
I mean,
no matter what.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.268
Everything's gonna work out
the way it's supposed to.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.889
And, now, before you
share your vows,

15:02.026 --> 15:06.645
if there is anyone here
who knows why these two
should not be joined together,

15:07.532 --> 15:11.616
speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.910
(THUNDER CRASHING)

15:16.958 --> 15:18.118
(EXCLAIMS)

15:25.591 --> 15:28.879
SARAH: I sense a high level
of adrenaline in your system.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.172
Is something
bothering you today?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.174
I think today
is yesterday.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.632
Again.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.226
Saturday again!
Again?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.223
Allison called. I mean,
what kind of Type A bride

15:44.360 --> 15:45.440
works the morning
of her wedding?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.811
Hmm.
SARAH made eggs. I know
you like the bottle.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.936
Not today.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.564
You didn't shave.
Safety precaution.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.192
Oh, you are freaked out
about the wedding.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.363
You're right!

15:55.496 --> 15:58.283
And I'm totally self-aware.
You and I should talk more
now that you're 17,

15:58.416 --> 16:00.657
but right now
I got to check out a theory
I just came up with.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.034
In the bathroom?
You'd be surprised what
happens to me in there.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.877
I think Aunt Lexi's coming
today with two cats.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.871
They should go directly
to the guest room,

16:07.008 --> 16:08.748
and get to know the tabby.
You might be related.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.797
I'll see you
at the wedding.
Got to go stop time.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.552
And drinking age is 21.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.341
Supervising an
important delivery?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.638
Carter.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.394
Time-sensitive, Fargo?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.478
Uh, yeah, I guess
you could say that.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.974
Could you also say that
that's a device that could
have created a time loop

16:26.110 --> 16:27.896
that I've been living in
for the last three days?

16:28.029 --> 16:29.018
Fargo, tell him
what it is.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.693
Uh, it's our new
sub-femtosecond
atomic clock

16:32.825 --> 16:35.908
that'll make G.D.
the constant for time
in all the known universe.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.987
And today's the day
you plug it in.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.161
It runs on unstable
plutonium neutrons,
not AC.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.830
Isn't that unstable?

16:44.962 --> 16:47.419
Well, of course,
'cause if they were stable,
they would split during...

16:47.548 --> 16:48.503
Why am I explaining this?

16:48.633 --> 16:51.090
Don't ask why,
just don't take that thing
out of its container

16:51.219 --> 16:53.551
until after your wedding.
Okay, we'll trust your gut,

16:53.679 --> 16:57.342
and miss
our only sync window
between now and 2036.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.431
Not! Um, we're
ready to move.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.970
Don't do this!

17:01.103 --> 17:04.015
We're all stuck in some
weird time thing where
things keep repeating.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.264
Yeah, and only
you remember it.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.777
Carter, this is
a very important project.
Don't screw it up.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.863
Allison's Director
of Operations.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.902
Why don't you ask her to
cancel synchronization?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.117
Well, because you'd
still have to approve.

17:18.246 --> 17:22.205
And I won't.
This clock gives G.D.
universal ownership of time.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.449
I know. I know,
and the Swiss are fuming,

17:24.585 --> 17:27.998
but if you plug this thing in,
we'll be doomed
to repeat this day forever.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.711
The happiest day
of my life?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.922
Sorry I had to call you in,
but quarterly balance
sheets...

17:32.051 --> 17:33.882
Yeah, quarterly balance...
Look, forget it.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.753
If we don't stop that clock
from turning on, you'll have
the rest of eternity to

17:37.139 --> 17:38.515
redact those 20 people.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.926
You said "a few
nonessentials."

17:40.059 --> 17:43.927

Don't want you to miss
your beautiful wedding.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.138

17:47.275 --> 17:48.355
You should have invited her.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.850
Carter, what is
wrong with you?
Nothing.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.571
Nothing
you'll remember.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.562
We just need to stop
that new clock.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.860
You're making me nervous.
I just want to get
through this.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.780
Well, you won't.
We're gonna do this
again, and again,

17:59.912 --> 18:01.823
unless right before 6:00,
I unplug that clock,

18:01.956 --> 18:03.867
and then, this horrible
day'll be over.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.991
Look, I know that you think
that I'm making a mistake,

18:06.127 --> 18:10.496
(STAMMERING)
and I am touched that
you care so much about me.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.748
Of course I...
I just need you to
be there for me today.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.127
Well, I'll always
be there for you.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.097
And if I am
late tonight,

18:23.102 --> 18:26.435
just know that I was
fixing something
that's broken.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.600

the way it's supposed to.

this thing goes off?

the official switchover
from Greenwich happens.

to get married.

to expand their
consciousness.

been to France.

to the wedding, I wonder
who will kill us first,

19:31.087 --> 19:32.793
Dr. Stark or Dr. Blake?

19:33.506 --> 19:37.169

matters now but

19:38.177 --> 19:40.384
unplugging this unstable
plutonium thing.

Thought you said we were here
to take emergency readouts
for Thorne?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.598

No.

Now.
What is wrong with you?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.186
Easy way, or hard way, Fargo?
We don't have much time.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.275
Apparently, we don't have
much sanity, either.

once we stop the time loop.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.934
and I think it's,
uh, important...

23:21.066 --> 23:23.478
Leo Weinbrenner,
confirmed.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.936
Would you...
Leo! One second.
Just...

23:27.072 --> 23:28.812
Sorry. Can I...
No, go ahead.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.234
(LAUGHS)
Thanks.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.781
You're in charge of time,
right? The guy
in the basement?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.620
Was, until today.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.867
Right. Um, I've been repeating
the same day, over and over.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.047
I mean, is it possible?
Can time just loop around
like that?

23:44.173 --> 23:46.835
You're asking the wrong guy.
I just oil the gears.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.127
Look, okay...

23:48.719 --> 23:51.426
Is there any reason why
Thorne would want to get rid
of you today?

23:51.555 --> 23:53.716
So that you wouldn't
help us?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.923
So that, uh,
you couldn't discover it?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.550
I wouldn't put
anything past her.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.393
She's up to something
with that new clock.
Don't know what,

24:00.522 --> 24:01.978
but it can't be good.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.018
Nothing that woman does
is good.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.268
Anyhow, I'll, uh, sign
those redaction papers
whenever you bring them by.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.564
Sure.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.483
COMPUTER: Shelley Halverson,
confirmed.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.983
I'll need all the calibrated
equipment in a truck by 5:00,
at the latest.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.451
There's a time factor here,
and I don't want to miss
my window.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.614
Sheriff. Eavesdropping
is a very nasty habit.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.366
No, I'm just checking in.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.710
You know, seeing
if there's anything
I can do for you, today.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.999
As a matter of fact...
Oh, redactions! Oh, boy!

24:27.132 --> 24:29.544
I love a good culling
of the herd.
Leo Weinbrenner?

24:29.677 --> 24:31.542
Is there any particular
reason you're getting rid
of him today?

24:31.679 --> 24:33.465
Dr. Stark is installing
a new clock

24:33.597 --> 24:36.054
that performs
the same functions
as Weinbrenner does

24:36.183 --> 24:38.139
without requiring
health care.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.929
Sub-femtosecond,
huh? I'll bet
the Swiss are fuming.

24:40.062 --> 24:43.099
By the way, I was wondering
if you wanted to be my date
to the wedding this evening.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.347
I could
pick you up
around 5:00,

24:44.483 --> 24:45.438
unless you're busy.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.058
No, thanks. I think you heard
that I've got something
important pending.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.652
Ah! Well,
you'll be missed.
No, I won't.

24:50.823 --> 24:54.111
Speaking of work,
sorry I had to call you in.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.234
Quarterly balance sheets
are due...
Balance sheets are due.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.907
...on Monday,
and this can't wait.

24:59.039 --> 25:03.123
Sheriff, make sure
she doesn't miss
her beautiful wedding.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.210
What's that about?

25:07.339 --> 25:09.079
You should have
invited her.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.047
But, I mean,
he's your gorgeous
Dr. WHO!

25:15.180 --> 25:17.466
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God,
I love that show.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.636
"World Health Organization."
He's an immunologist.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.805
(STAMMERING)
Oh, no, I knew that.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.891
Duncan's work
is everything to him.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.016
I can't ask him
to give it all up
and move here just for me.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.562
It's notjust for you.

25:29.695 --> 25:35.486
I didn't tell him, Zoe.
I want someone to be with me
for the right reasons.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.944
Not the responsible ones.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.238
Well, speaking of
responsible ones...

25:40.539 --> 25:41.779
ZOE: Hey, Dad,
look who's here!

25:41.915 --> 25:42.904
(EXCLAIMS) Hey, Lexi

25:43.042 --> 25:46.660
Oh, three days early,
uh, cats in the guest room,
you look terrific!

25:46.795 --> 25:49.207
Um, has anyone seen Henry?
He's not answering his phone.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.001
Dad! Um, Aunt Lexi
wants to stay here
for a while.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.001
Great. Um, I got a big
problem now, and I really
need to contact Henry.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.673
Dad!
Yeah?

25:56.805 --> 25:58.670
No, Zoe, it's okay.
He doesn't have time for me.

25:58.807 --> 26:03.141
(LAUGHING) Come on, Lex.
You go away for six years,
and I'm the bad guy?

26:03.270 --> 26:05.226
I was working.
I am working.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.185
Um... Uh...

26:09.610 --> 26:12.101
Look, once things
return to normal,
we can sit down,

26:12.237 --> 26:13.943
we can have a nice,
long conversation...
Oh, great,

26:14.073 --> 26:16.064
so you can give me
that speech about
how I need stability,

26:16.200 --> 26:19.067
and I need to settle down
and get a real life?

26:19.203 --> 26:20.158
I don't know. Maybe...

26:20.287 --> 26:23.279
VVeH,Iguess
my mistake was thinking
I could do that here.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.744
(GROANING) Lex...

26:26.376 --> 26:27.286
Way to go, Dad.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.375
Oh, honey,
she's been doing this
her whole life.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.292
She lives by her whims,
and then makes
everyone else's life crazy.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.130
Aunt Lexi's pregnant.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.212
She came to us
for help, because

26:36.804 --> 26:38.465
that's what family is for.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.386
(STAMMERS) Okay.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.679
|'|| fix it.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.060
(WHIRRING)

26:51.193 --> 26:53.104
Something big
down there, huh?

26:54.988 --> 26:56.068
Seems, uh,

26:56.782 --> 26:57.771
complicated.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.990
It's very complicated,
Shenﬁ.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.826
Would it have anything
to do with why you fired
Weinbrenner today?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.286
Is it a coincidence
that you fire him

27:04.414 --> 27:06.279
on the same day
that you have something
secretive to do out here

27:06.416 --> 27:07.872
with all this, uh,

27:08.460 --> 27:09.916
well-calibrated
equipment?

27:10.045 --> 27:11.785
Say what's on
your mind, Sheriff.

27:11.922 --> 27:15.039
Everyone in town
is at this sweet
little wedding,

27:15.175 --> 27:16.915
except you.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.043
And you're out here
manipulating time,

27:19.179 --> 27:21.795
making us
repeat the same day
over and over,

27:21.932 --> 27:23.547
and you don't know
how dangerous that is.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.049
(LAUGHS) You're
wrong, Sheriff.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.345
Maybe.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.688
Mind if I see that?

27:29.273 --> 27:30.809
Not at all.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.858
What button do I press
to send myself
back to the shower?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.102
(CLICKS BUTTON)

27:42.828 --> 27:44.113
(GROANING)

27:47.082 --> 27:51.041
SARAH: I'm sensing
broken bones, lacerations,
and contusions.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.040
Shall I call 9-1-1?

27:54.173 --> 27:57.165
(GROANING) I don't know.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.835
Only if they can fix
a hole in the universe.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.635
HENRY: Sit down.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.927
So you say you, uh...
You came through with this?

28:09.062 --> 28:11.474
Yeah, it's what Thorne used
to create the time loop.

28:11.607 --> 28:14.019
No, this device is not
a time-control device.

28:14.151 --> 28:18.235
This device is a geological
depth finder, kind of like
an MRI for rocks.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.740
As a matter of fact,
why don't we see
what she was up to?

28:20.866 --> 28:25.075
She was manipulating time,
probably using that clock
that Stark just hooked up.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.910
No, no, no, no, no, these
are spatial measurements,

28:27.039 --> 28:28.245
compartments
deep in solid rock.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.453
And man-made.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.039
Okay, well, then,
Weinbrenner.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.908
Maybe she got me
to fire him so that
he wouldn't stop her.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.501
Leo Weinbrenner?
You know him?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.791
Yeah, we worked at NASA
together. He was
a temporal physicist

28:36.924 --> 28:40.883
who was working
on the EPR Paradox.
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen...

28:41.011 --> 28:44.879
Anyway, he had this theory
about bending light
in order to alter time,

28:45.015 --> 28:46.425
which he almost got to work.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.052
He lied to me.

28:48.810 --> 28:52.098
He made me think it was
Thorne who was behind it.
It wasn't Thorne.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.311
It was him.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.557
Jack, bending time
is impossible.

28:56.693 --> 29:00.277
He knew he was redacted
before Thorne
even told Allison.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.951
COMPUTER:
Virginia Brown.
Confirmed.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.109
Leo Weinbrenner. Confirmed.
Well,

29:07.246 --> 29:09.988
I guess redaction
starts pretty early
around here.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.705
See,Leo,
that's the problem.

29:12.834 --> 29:16.668
It is too early,
and Thorne hasn't laid
anyone off yet.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.748
So, how could you
know that?

29:21.468 --> 29:24.005
I knew you were on to me
the last time through.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.508
(WHISPERING) Then why
didn't you say something?

29:27.641 --> 29:29.927
I was afraid
you'd shut me down.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.176
Then I'd never have
a chance to fix it.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.098
Tell me what you did.

29:35.315 --> 29:39.433
Ultra Indigo. It's the closest
light frequency to pure black.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.854
Strictly theoretical,

29:41.530 --> 29:42.861
until now.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.908
Oh, my God!

29:54.042 --> 29:55.452
What is this?

29:55.919 --> 29:57.295
Perfectly harmless.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.828
Exactly what
Einstein theorized.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.958
Am I getting
radiation poisoning
right now?

30:04.094 --> 30:05.379
(LAUGHS) No.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.889
See, any particle that
reflects Ultra Indigo

30:11.018 --> 30:12.633
won't move along
with the normal spectrum.

30:12.769 --> 30:15.431
So this Indigo stuff
created the time loop?

30:15.564 --> 30:19.898
Nope. That's what this
particle decelerator is for.

30:20.444 --> 30:21.479
A...

30:21.611 --> 30:23.192
(SIGHING) Okay.
I'm lost.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.108
Okay, I made
one photon of light

30:26.241 --> 30:28.323
travel slower than
the speed of normal light.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.693
Its reflection caused
a chain reaction

30:30.829 --> 30:32.740
that made all light
travel slower,

30:32.873 --> 30:34.659
back to an exact
point in ti me

30:35.042 --> 30:36.373
that I chose.

30:37.127 --> 30:40.085
So you made time
flow backwards?

30:40.213 --> 30:43.956
Yeah. Only something
bathed in Ultra Indigo
wouldn't be affected.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.964
So, that morning,
when I came into your lab...

30:48.096 --> 30:50.178
I was sending
the photon back.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.635
I stood in the
Ultra Indigo field

30:52.768 --> 30:53.848
so that I would
stay the same

30:53.977 --> 30:56.559
while the universe
traveled backward
around me.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.472
But the light must've hit
you, too, and trapped you
in this day with me.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.479
I'm so sorry.

31:03.612 --> 31:07.855
So just make it
go fonNards again.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.359
Reset the photon thingy.

31:11.912 --> 31:15.154
What do you think
I've been working on
in here every day?

31:15.624 --> 31:16.989
And it just keeps
getting worse.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.081
(SHIOCKED)
You don't know
how to reverse it?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.833
Isn't that a little like
jumping out of a plane

31:20.962 --> 31:23.123
and trying
to invent a parachute
before you hit the ground?

31:23.256 --> 31:25.963
Look, I had to.
Hey, I was being redacted.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.675
Thorne made it very clear
I had to vacate
the premises by 6:00 pm.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.420
She didn't even care
how close I was.

31:32.015 --> 31:35.758
So, Leo, is this
time loop permanent?

31:35.894 --> 31:38.806
Just until I figure out
how to get things
back to normal.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.978
But I gave myself
all the time in the world.
10 hours at a time.

31:43.110 --> 31:46.443
Or until the time wave
that split the sky
and broke my ribs

31:46.571 --> 31:48.527
deletes everything
in the universe.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.568
I didn't expect that
to happen.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.032
I'm working
as fast as I can.

31:53.161 --> 31:58.406
Okay. All right, you can
do that with, um, all this?

31:59.167 --> 32:03.160
Almost. I've got
everything down,
except for the timer.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.914
I haven't had time
to invent it yet.
Ironic, huh?

32:07.050 --> 32:08.426
Well, how are you gonna...

32:08.552 --> 32:11.009
I'm gonna use my baby,
the G.D. clock.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.095
I go in and manually
connect both devices

32:14.224 --> 32:17.091
at the precise moment
of synchronicity with
the time-space continuum.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.216
All goes well,

32:18.353 --> 32:21.436
I come out normal,
and time will be
on its linear way.

32:23.859 --> 32:26.350
Look, uh, Sheriff,
if this doesn't work,

32:27.779 --> 32:30.065
I'm not
gonna be able to help you
the next time through.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.985
It'll be Dr. Stark
that you need.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.733
He'll never believe me.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.701
Well, he will

32:41.460 --> 32:43.200
if I teach you this.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.789
Oh, dude.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.099
The clock's calibrated to
link up with the accelerator
30 seconds from now.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.934
COMPUTER: Sequence
commencing in 30 seconds.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.054
We maybe got one more time
through the loop.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.898
Two, tops, before things
start being deleted for good.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.609
IfI don't, uh...

33:09.738 --> 33:12.855
Sequence commencing
in 20 seconds.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.690
Just know that I never
meant any harm.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.279
You'll get it right.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.324
Sequence commencing
in 10 seconds.

33:20.707 --> 33:24.871
Nine, eight, seven, six,

33:25.003 --> 33:28.040
five, four, three,

33:28.173 --> 33:30.585
two, one, zero.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.801
(SHOWER RUNNING)

33:39.309 --> 33:40.469
Leo.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.091
NO.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.402
One more chance.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.116
Weinbrenner died
trying to reaccelerate time.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.117
Carter, you're crazy.
Fargo, tell him
why he's crazy.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.869
Hold on!

34:10.131 --> 34:11.712
(SINGING TO THE TUNE OF
TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR)

of one minus V squared

34:15.387 --> 34:17.799

where V is greater than C...

34:17.931 --> 34:20.217
Wait a minute. "Where V
is greater than C."

34:22.143 --> 34:24.134
(TO HIMSELF)
...over C squared,
where V is greater than C...

34:24.271 --> 34:25.101
Yeah, "greater."

34:25.230 --> 34:28.017
Yeah. Yeah, that's
the formula for breaking
the light-speed barrier.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.138
Where'd you learn it?

34:29.276 --> 34:31.016
Hey, we have a problem.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.690
Leo Weinbrenner's
charred body was found
in the time maintenance room.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.898
Henry's coming in
to do an autopsy.

34:39.035 --> 34:41.526
Good. Good. He'll know
about the time loop.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.745
Carter, you got a second?

34:44.583 --> 34:45.572
One sec.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.953
What? Do you want me
to sing another verse?

34:49.796 --> 34:50.785
NO.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.121
(SOFTLY)
I believe you.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.088
If what I'm looking at
is correct,

34:54.217 --> 34:56.959
none of us
may make it through
the next time wave.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.340
It's Allie's big day.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.173
Keep this between us?

35:05.729 --> 35:06.809
Sure.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.984
So shouldn't you be
at a beauty parlor
or something?

35:18.116 --> 35:20.858
What, is it 1960
and no one told me?

35:20.994 --> 35:22.200
Um...

35:23.413 --> 35:25.950
There's something I wanted
to say to you.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.450
Um, I know that
you love Nathan,

35:30.128 --> 35:33.916
and that you guys
have this history.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.965
You're gonna have
a great future.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.759
I think, this time,
we just might.

35:41.181 --> 35:44.014
But, make sure
you get him to the
wedding on time.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.224
Count on it.
Okay.

35:48.605 --> 35:51.813
Weinbrennerjury-rigged
the old G.D. clock
to the accelerator.

35:52.275 --> 35:56.234
Yeah, he did it manually,
because he didn't have the
time to create a new timer.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.737
I was here.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.610
Well, there,
but I was here.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.531
(SIGHING) Well,
it must not have been
accurate enough.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.492
No, but yours is.

36:08.792 --> 36:12.205
Uh, the new clock,
the one that the Swiss
are fuming about.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.086
Carter, sometimes
you're smarter
than you look.

36:17.342 --> 36:20.175
Fargo, we have
an important delivery
to supervise.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.427
She is? Wow. Uh...

36:31.272 --> 36:34.059
Cats, yeah.
Just put them
in the guest room,

36:34.192 --> 36:36.899
and if you guys
could go to Cafe Diem...

36:38.279 --> 36:40.770
Yeah, I'm gonna be
a little busy later,
but, um,

36:41.741 --> 36:44.232
I don't want to miss
spending time with you.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.030
Okay.

he's your gorgeous
Dr. WHO!

Oh, my God,
I love that show.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.996
Oh!
HI, guys.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.127
Dad! What happened
to your face?

37:00.260 --> 37:05.129
No, I'm all right.
Um, Duncan
is an immunologist.

37:05.265 --> 37:08.803
He and Lexi spent the
last six years traveling
around doing, uh,

37:09.144 --> 37:10.259
good things.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.931
(STUTTERING)
No, I knew that.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.894
Here I thought
you never read
my letters.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.103
No!
What happened?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.189
Did you crash your
Big Wheel again?

37:17.318 --> 37:18.694
Nice.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.522
I missed you, Monkey.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.653
Yeah, I missed you,
too, Stretch.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.943
You haven't called me that
since I was 12 years old.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.113
Well, you used to hate it.
Yeah, because I was
this tall in seventh grade.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.406
All right, fair enough.

37:29.539 --> 37:32.497
You know, I'm glad
you came early.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.242
It's good to be able
to see you before the...

37:36.004 --> 37:36.993
Before what?

37:37.130 --> 37:38.415
Um, before the wedding.

37:38.548 --> 37:42.040
Love weddings!
They're final, yet festive,
like funerals with champagne.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.044
Um, I got something
to take care of.
Just thought I'd come by

37:45.180 --> 37:47.796
and say, uh,

37:49.100 --> 37:50.385
that I love you guys.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.723
Since when
have you become
this self-aware?

37:54.856 --> 37:57.222
I can learn,
it just takes me a few tries.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.148
And, uh,

37:59.486 --> 38:00.521
you guys helped.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.689
Well, that's
what family's for.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.279
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.273
It is.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.567
Oh, uh, just...

38:09.454 --> 38:10.990
Ditch Grandma Lil
for me.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.618
What if
none of this
is true?

38:14.751 --> 38:16.912
What if
we accelerate a photon
beyond the speed of light,

38:17.045 --> 38:19.752
and it ends up
creating a time hole and
destroying the universe?

38:19.881 --> 38:21.712
We have
two choices, Fargo.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.377
Either we trust Carter,
or we don't.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.341
Guys, we close?

38:25.595 --> 38:29.087
Yeah, this new clock should
synch up with the accelerator,
theoretically.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.180
I did what I could
to shore up the
vacuum seal,

38:31.309 --> 38:33.049
but it's
really not meant
for this kind of use.

38:33.186 --> 38:36.144
CARTER: All right.
It's almost six.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.684
All right, Fargo.
Start her up.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.897
Ifthe seal holds,
we accelerate the photon,
and time gets back to normal.

38:58.211 --> 39:00.452
(MACHINE POWERING DOWN)

39:01.297 --> 39:02.503
What happened?

39:02.632 --> 39:05.169
We lost the seal.
We can't synch the clock.
What do we do?

39:05.301 --> 39:06.586
We do it manually.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.673
From inside? Like
what Weinbrenner tried?

39:09.806 --> 39:11.171
We've got less
than 60 seconds.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.178
I'll do it. Tell me
what I need to know.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.301
I can't teach you a song
for this one, Carter.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.688
It's a little too complicated.

39:17.814 --> 39:18.803
(SIGHS)

39:19.190 --> 39:20.350
But not for me.

39:21.317 --> 39:24.150
I know how.
I'll do it.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.320
I always knew
you had it
in you, Fargo.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.106
I didn't.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.236
But I helped build
this thing, and we
only got one shot.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.620
Go synch me up, okay?

39:44.507 --> 39:48.716
Are you sure?
What about Allie?
What if you can't...

39:48.845 --> 39:52.053
Course, I can.
My ego's bigger than
the building, remember?

the necklace, right?

39:57.186 --> 39:58.562
Yeah, I do.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.225
Well, make sure
she gets it,

40:01.983 --> 40:03.598
and that she knows
I did this for her.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.147

Yeah.

We are.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.313
He's gone?

41:28.569 --> 41:29.729
He's really gone?

41:39.831 --> 41:43.073
I can't have any,
because of Baby Carter,
but don't let that stop you.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.621
You know, the French
give their children
wine with dinner.

41:46.129 --> 41:48.495
Yeah, well, Dad's
never been to France.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.174
Dad!

42:03.438 --> 42:05.804
You're late.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.515
(WHISPERING) Okay.

No matter what.

You look pale.
