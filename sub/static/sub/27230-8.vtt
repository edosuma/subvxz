Tavo, I want to thank you
for speaking with me.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.238
Forgive me, Princess Allura,
but we don't have much time.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.032
-I'm sorry?
-Please.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.494
Once Honerva discovers
I'm speaking with you, it will be over.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.620
Slow down.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.455
-What are you trying to--?
-Listen to me.

she will use him to destroy everything--

Tavo!

This unit uses the ship's crystal

It was designed to contain diseases,
but it should suffice

02:28.898 --> 02:31.192
until we find a more permanent solution.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.069
Thank you, Sam.

02:33.361 --> 02:37.907
That thing, it was as if
it was communicating with me.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.328
Whatever this is, it might be
how Honerva connects to the Alteans.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.455
Perhaps you should get some rest.

03:12.817 --> 03:16.696
And here I was thinking
you were afraid to show your face

03:16.779 --> 03:19.073
after ruining the last Clear Day.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.825
Yes, sorry about that.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.911
[stammering] That was on me.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.246
We noticed a lot of activity
on your planet's surface.

Are you in danger?

Opposite! [laughs]

03:28.958 --> 03:31.044
We're celebrating Clear Day!

03:36.341 --> 03:37.550
It's right now!

03:37.634 --> 03:42.138
So unless you'd like to waste
more of my time, I need to get back.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.390
Are you sure hosting
a celebration is safe?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.893
This sector has seen
a lot of hostile activity lately.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.937
[chuckles] Oh, here we go.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.605
I knew this was coming.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.191
In fact, I just told my wife.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.777
I said to her, "Just you wait.

You don't know them the way I do.

that Voltron is coming to Clear Day.

Then Voltron never arrives,

04:08.915 --> 04:14.128
and you're left with your top two paws
stuck in the rocks!"

04:14.545 --> 04:16.506
We don't wanna ruin your holiday,
but we're--

04:16.589 --> 04:19.467
We're having Clear Day, and that is that!

04:19.842 --> 04:22.512
If you're so worried about our safety,

04:22.595 --> 04:26.015
then how about you show up
and provide security?

Free of charge!

04:29.352 --> 04:31.688
Veronica, make an announcement
to the Atlas.

We're going to Clear Day.

You sure you don't wanna head
to the carnival?

04:37.360 --> 04:40.113
I'm pretty sure the Swathian Meerakeet
won't try to eat us.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.155
I'm sure.

04:41.823 --> 04:45.118
I haven't been feeling well,
especially after what happened to Tavo.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.662
I need to rest.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.247
Right.

04:49.330 --> 04:52.667
Well, I could stay here with you,
keep you company if you want.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.502
Please, go have fun.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.546
Maybe you can win me a prize.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.548
Something sparkly?

04:58.881 --> 05:00.174
Yeah, okay.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.885
Winning prizes is kinda my specialty.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.013
I am a sharpshooter, after all.

[Shiro] I want you all
to enjoy yourselves today.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.858
The celebration ends in five vargas.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.861
It's important to remember
that while the Atlas patrols the skies,

05:19.944 --> 05:24.032
we are the eyes and ears on the ground
looking for any suspicious activity.

to bring back for her.

-I'll help, too.
-Me, three.

Let's remember why we came here
in the first place:

05:51.768 --> 05:53.478
to provide security for the event.

05:54.896 --> 05:55.772
Right.

05:55.855 --> 06:00.902
Well, I better go find the arcade
and make sure it's safe, yeah!

Uh, me, too!

Uh, wait for me!

Go have fun.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.373
If we're not here for protection,
then what are we doing here?

Morale on the Atlas is low
after what happened on Oriande.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.755
Who knows? A few hours at the carnival
might give us the boost we need

06:20.838 --> 06:22.006
to get back on track.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.225
[Allura] Lance?
What are you doing here?

06:33.017 --> 06:34.936
I thought you were going to the carnival.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.021
That's a beautiful flower.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.898
Where did you get it?

06:38.981 --> 06:40.358
[Allura] Colleen gave it to me.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.735
It's a real juniberry flower.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.363
I assumed they had gone extinct.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.407
[Lotor] You should know
better than anyone,

06:48.491 --> 06:51.285
nothing ever truly goes extinct.

It's good to see you again, Princess.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.130
How? How did you get in here?

07:02.880 --> 07:06.217
You know, the ancients believed
that all of life began

07:06.300 --> 07:08.386
with a single juniberry flower.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.098
[blade rings]

I thought you'd be happy to see me.

What are you doing here?
I demand to know!

07:21.524 --> 07:23.860
You and I desire the same thing.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.237
We both seek to destroy Haggar.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.738
Haggar?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.741
Haggar is no longer.
She's Honerva now.

07:31.242 --> 07:35.037
True. Though I could rename this
a highlands poppy,

07:35.121 --> 07:38.082
you and I would still know
what it truly is.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.837
The witch may change her name,
but she will always be a witch.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.798
Be that as it may, she's too powerful.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.676
There's nothing I can do
to counter her abilities.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.052

Everything you need is here.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.516
How?

07:58.436 --> 08:01.147
This entity holds the power you seek.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.276
It is an ancient form of energy
that predates time itself.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.862
It hails from the Quintessence Field.

08:09.363 --> 08:13.743
Entities like this gave Haggar
the ability to conquer worlds

08:13.826 --> 08:17.288
and control the universe for 10,000 years.

08:17.997 --> 08:22.210
She recognizes the strength
it provides her, and she uses it.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.463
If you can become one with the entity,

08:25.671 --> 08:28.925
then the powers you gain
can defeat the witch.

[chuckles]
it's kind of our thing.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.361
Oh, is that right?
Let me see.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.281
I happen to have a one-of-a-kind,
collector's edition

13:44.365 --> 13:47.117
blue mechanical flying feline.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.494
Perfect! How much?

13:48.577 --> 13:50.454
They only gave us
ten of these token thingies.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.497
Oh, wonderful!

13:51.956 --> 13:55.084
Ten tokens is exactly how much it costs
to play the game!

13:56.502 --> 13:57.920
Did these rings shrink?

13:58.295 --> 14:00.089
Oh, no, friend.

14:00.172 --> 14:04.843
They just look smaller in your
strong, masculine hands. [chuckles]

14:05.594 --> 14:07.513
Hmm. [grunting]

14:09.807 --> 14:13.394
Oh! So close.
Care to try again?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.729
Oh, this game is rigged!

14:15.813 --> 14:17.523
And I don't have any more tokens.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.317
Well, perhaps we can make a deal.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.114
What's the best prize you have?

14:25.739 --> 14:30.035
Every prize is the best prize,
and everyone goes home a winner.

14:30.536 --> 14:35.416
Okay, but say I was giving the prize
to a princess.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.210
For a princess?
Behold.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.049
I'll take it!

14:44.341 --> 14:48.554
Sure, but you're gonna need
about twice as many tickets as this.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.181
But I don't have any more tokens.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.977
Well, in that case, you could get
one of these shovels and use it

14:55.060 --> 14:57.855
to dig your way out of the hole
you find yourself in.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.442
I'll find a way to get more tickets.

when you waste it all on--

-Okay. How much do you need?
-How much do you got?

16:08.258 --> 16:09.635
You'll have to earn them.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.470
I want a family picture.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.226
I'll take the picture,
but I pick the costume.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.645
I get to add one accessory
and you have to smile.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.063
Half smile.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.108

17:03.272 --> 17:04.273
I can't.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.358
I won't.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.318
It won't do any harm.
