00:08.156 --> 00:09.522
(Voice breaks)
My parents kicked me out.

00:09.524 --> 00:10.756
I was hoping
he could stay with us.

00:10.758 --> 00:11.824
Of course he can stay.

00:11.826 --> 00:13.893
Seeing my parents' faces
made me feel bad

00:13.895 --> 00:15.027
about what I'm doing.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.896
You being gay... that is
their issue, not yours.

00:16.898 --> 00:18.864
These are
your college applications.

00:18.866 --> 00:20.533
Time to start planning
your future.

00:20.535 --> 00:22.705
Never, ever become friends with
one of my boyfriends again.

00:22.825 --> 00:23.484
Okay.

00:23.604 --> 00:24.819
Cool party. I'm Scott.

00:24.939 --> 00:26.705
You don't have to talk to me
if it bugs you.

00:26.707 --> 00:28.307
No! I-I like it.

00:28.309 --> 00:29.942
My dad... he's gonna give me
an allowance

00:29.944 --> 00:31.010
to find a place in Manhattan.

00:31.012 --> 00:32.411
What do you think
about the flat?

00:32.412 --> 00:34.613
I think I can make this work.

00:34.615 --> 00:36.215
Ooh, you are gonna
adore it here!

00:36.217 --> 00:38.450
(Carrie) - You gonna be good here?
- Yeah.

01:49.790 --> 01:52.757
What happened to Larissa's
zebra-print chaise lounge?

01:52.759 --> 01:54.526
Well, Carrie,
in case you hadn't noticed,

01:54.528 --> 01:55.660
I'm a guy.

01:55.662 --> 01:57.729
Oh, I definitely noticed.
Whoa! (Chuckles)

01:57.731 --> 01:59.130
(Chuckles)

01:59.132 --> 02:00.899
What's with the...
All the... the skateboards

02:00.901 --> 02:02.167
and the clothes?

02:02.169 --> 02:04.202
- Pretty sick, right?
- "Sick"?

02:04.204 --> 02:06.971
Sorry, skater lingo. It means
"cool." (Siren wailing in distance)

02:06.973 --> 02:08.973
Since when do you speak
skater lingo?

02:08.975 --> 02:10.708
Well, I used to skate
with my cousins out in Jersey.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.210
- Oh.
- Then when I was in Cali,

02:12.212 --> 02:13.978
I started hanging out
with this guy, Tony,

02:13.980 --> 02:15.613
and he's kind of
a skating prodigy.

02:15.615 --> 02:17.448
I didn't know
there was such thing

02:17.450 --> 02:19.317
as a skating prodigy.

02:19.319 --> 02:20.952
Well, this guy is.
Tony Hawk.

02:20.954 --> 02:22.253
Remember the name.

02:22.255 --> 02:23.421
I'm telling you,
he's gonna be huge.

02:23.423 --> 02:24.989
What are you, his mom?

02:24.991 --> 02:26.758
Very funny.
We became pretty good friends,

02:26.760 --> 02:28.493
and I'm hoping to use
some of his contacts

02:28.495 --> 02:30.061
for a business
I might be starting.

02:30.063 --> 02:31.296
Wait. What?

02:31.298 --> 02:32.930
Well, he knows everyone
in the skateboarding world,

02:32.932 --> 02:34.365
and I think
there's a market out there

02:34.367 --> 02:35.833
that hasn't been tapped into.

02:35.835 --> 02:38.403
Like shoes, clothes,
all based on skate culture.

02:38.405 --> 02:39.971
And look at these cool designs.

02:39.973 --> 02:43.408
I-I commissioned a street artist
to create the decks.

02:43.410 --> 02:44.742
"Decks"?

02:44.744 --> 02:46.410
Yeah, the part of the skateboard
that's not the wheels.

02:46.412 --> 02:47.545
Oh.

02:47.547 --> 02:51.048
So these could be
on shirts, shorts.

02:51.050 --> 02:52.950
Got it. (Chuckles)

02:52.952 --> 02:55.253
Yeah. I'm really excited
about this, Carrie.

02:55.255 --> 02:58.489
Well, then that sounds,
uh... sick. (Chuckles)

02:58.491 --> 03:00.691
All right, I'll shut up
about skateboards.

03:00.693 --> 03:02.860
Let's talk about
Valentine's Day instead.

03:02.862 --> 03:04.895
Oh, yeah?
Does that mean...

03:04.897 --> 03:07.465
I made the reservation at
One If By Land, Two If By Sea.

03:07.467 --> 03:08.599
(Gasps) Ooh, yay!

03:08.601 --> 03:09.800
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

03:09.802 --> 03:11.569
I know Valentine's Day
is cheesy,

03:11.571 --> 03:14.171
but I'm so excited to spend it
with you in the city,

03:14.173 --> 03:16.874
especially after everything
we've been through together.

03:16.876 --> 03:18.676
I just... I want it
to be perfect.

03:18.678 --> 03:19.977
It will be.

03:19.979 --> 03:22.513
Okay.

03:22.515 --> 03:24.682
(Skateboard clatters)

03:26.218 --> 03:29.820
<i>My expectations for</i>
<i>Valentine's Day were sky-high.</i>

03:29.822 --> 03:31.956

03:31.958 --> 03:34.225
<i>For the holiday,</i>
<i>or for her future.</i>

03:34.227 --> 03:36.560
You got into Central Connecticut
State University.

03:36.562 --> 03:37.928
That's great!

03:37.930 --> 03:39.463
Yeah, with no financial aid.

03:39.465 --> 03:42.466
You can still apply for a loan.

03:42.468 --> 03:44.535
Oh, so I can be broke
for the rest of my life

03:44.537 --> 03:46.737
and still have no clue
what I'm doing

03:46.739 --> 03:48.305
and have a degree
from a lame school.

03:48.307 --> 03:50.574
C.C.S.U.'s a perfectly
respectable school.

03:50.576 --> 03:52.576
Please. You're the one
who calls it C.C.S.-Loser.

03:52.578 --> 03:54.011
In my defense,

03:54.013 --> 03:56.313
that was before I knew
you were going there.

03:56.315 --> 03:58.282
And they have some
notable alumni.

03:58.284 --> 04:00.617
Did you know that one of
the first governors of Alaska

04:00.619 --> 04:01.919
graduated from there?

04:01.921 --> 04:04.555
Ugh. I would never wanna be
the governor of Alaska.

04:04.557 --> 04:06.657
Hawaii. Now we're talking.
Not Alaska.

04:06.659 --> 04:08.959
I'm very sensitive to the cold.

04:08.961 --> 04:11.295
Oh, speaking of cold,
here comes Donna.

04:11.297 --> 04:13.130
- Let's freeze her out.
- Hey, Mouse!

04:13.132 --> 04:15.265
Happy military
recruitment week.

04:15.267 --> 04:16.300
I don't know about you,

04:16.302 --> 04:18.834
but I am feeling very...
Patriotic.

04:18.837 --> 04:21.438
Make sure you check out
the army eye candy.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.541
This year's
are particularly fine.

04:24.543 --> 04:25.842
(Donna) Mm.

04:27.879 --> 04:29.746
What was that all about?

04:29.748 --> 04:31.948
Oh, it's army recruitment time,
you know?

04:31.950 --> 04:33.583
The recruiters come to school
for two weeks

04:33.585 --> 04:36.586
to sign people up
to join after graduation.

04:36.588 --> 04:38.088
That's not what I'm talking
about, and you know it.

04:38.090 --> 04:40.056
What is going on
with you and Donna?

04:40.058 --> 04:41.258
You two were downright chummy.

04:41.260 --> 04:44.294
(Scoffs) - I wouldn't say chummy.
- Chummy.

04:44.296 --> 04:47.030
(Sighs) Okay, look,
Donna and I kind of had fun

04:47.032 --> 04:48.598
together at
Carrie's party last month.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.166
Ugh. I could've stopped that.

04:50.168 --> 04:53.303
I never should've gone away
with my parents that weekend.

04:53.305 --> 04:54.437
And then, it turns out,

04:54.439 --> 04:56.106
we have health class together
this semester.

04:56.108 --> 04:58.608
And I sit right next to her
and she's actually kinda funny.

04:58.610 --> 05:00.043
And I want you to know,

05:00.045 --> 05:01.678
I have strongly suggested
to Donna

05:01.680 --> 05:03.413
that she no longer
call you names.

05:03.415 --> 05:04.914
Okay, good,

05:04.916 --> 05:07.011
because it is terrible that she
calls people names. Mm-hmm.

05:07.131 --> 05:09.143
I would never stoop to that.

05:10.422 --> 05:11.788
Okay, Donna may be
a skanky whorebeast,

05:11.790 --> 05:13.022
but she is right
about one thing...

05:13.024 --> 05:14.924
those army guys
are total babes.

05:14.926 --> 05:16.593
The army will take care
of it for you,

05:16.595 --> 05:18.027
not college.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.130
(Larissa) No.

05:21.132 --> 05:22.565
Nope.

05:22.567 --> 05:24.901
Horrid.

05:24.903 --> 05:26.202
Oh.
Looks like she's squatting

05:26.204 --> 05:28.971
to give birth in a field in this one.
(Chuckles)

05:28.973 --> 05:30.073
Ah, here we are.

05:30.075 --> 05:31.808
She only looks
slightly constipated here.

05:31.810 --> 05:33.576
Remind me never
to book her again.

05:33.578 --> 05:34.911
If you need a model,
I'm available.

05:34.913 --> 05:36.946
Darling, this is
a high-fashion magazine.

05:36.948 --> 05:38.915
I once walked the runway
at the Tallahassee Mall

05:38.917 --> 05:40.149
Back-To-School Fashion Show.

05:40.151 --> 05:41.784
Yeah, I rest my case.

05:41.786 --> 05:42.852
(Telephone ringing in distance)

05:42.854 --> 05:44.554
Oh, Walt!

05:44.556 --> 05:45.888
I didn't know you were
coming tonight.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.190
Yeah, it's last minute.

05:47.192 --> 05:48.724
Bennet and I are gonna see
"Hannah and Her Sisters."

05:48.726 --> 05:50.259
(Bennet)
Which I'm very excited about!

05:50.261 --> 05:51.794
- I'll be down in a minute.
(Chuckles) - Okay.

05:51.796 --> 05:53.629
"Hannah and Her Sisters"?

05:53.631 --> 05:55.598
Shouldn't you be seeing
Hank and His Brothers?

05:55.600 --> 05:57.366
Or is girl-on-girl porn
a new trend for gay guys?

05:57.368 --> 05:59.001
(Scoffs) I can't keep up.

05:59.003 --> 06:00.503
Um, it's a Woody Allen movie.

06:00.505 --> 06:02.605
<i>Woody</i> Allen?
What a great porn name.

06:02.607 --> 06:03.706
It's not... (Chuckles)

06:03.708 --> 06:04.774
He's a director.

06:04.776 --> 06:06.676
So he directs porn?
Even better.

06:06.678 --> 06:08.978
He wrote and directed
"Annie Hall."

06:08.980 --> 06:10.112
And starred in it.

06:10.114 --> 06:12.415
- With Diane Keaton?
- I don't know.

06:12.417 --> 06:14.216
Oh, that movie is such
a love letter to the city.

06:14.218 --> 06:15.518
Speaking of love,

06:15.520 --> 06:17.153
do you have any suggestions
for restaurants

06:17.155 --> 06:18.521
on Valentine's Day?

06:18.523 --> 06:20.122
I wanna plan
a romantic dinner for Bennet and me.

06:20.124 --> 06:21.423
Stop right there.

06:21.425 --> 06:23.159
You don't need to make
any plans for that night.

06:23.161 --> 06:25.961
You all have to come see me
at my new place of business.

06:25.963 --> 06:29.031
You want us to help you
sell knives door-to-door?

06:29.033 --> 06:30.299
Oh, honey,
I already quit that job.

06:30.301 --> 06:32.835
I'm working
the Heartbreaker Party at Boy.

06:32.837 --> 06:34.003
(Bennet) Boy?!

06:34.005 --> 06:35.437
Ooh, I love that place.

06:35.439 --> 06:37.139
You've got a job at the most
fabulous gay club in the city?

06:37.141 --> 06:38.273
How did you wrangle that?

06:38.275 --> 06:40.309
Oh, no, wait, wait.
Let me guess.

06:40.311 --> 06:42.878
They mistook you
for a drag queen!

06:42.880 --> 06:43.946
(Chuckles)

06:43.948 --> 06:46.448
Their Heartbreaker Party
is legendary.

06:46.450 --> 06:48.417
(Kisses) I'm in, of course.

06:48.419 --> 06:50.319
Harlan will be in Budapest
on business next week,

06:50.321 --> 06:52.054
and this is the perfect way
for me to flirt

06:52.056 --> 06:53.922
with gorgeous men
without making him jealous.

06:53.924 --> 06:54.957
What do you say?

06:54.959 --> 06:56.291
I've always wanted to go
to that party.

06:56.293 --> 06:57.993
Oh.

06:57.995 --> 07:00.062
Um... (Chuckles)
Isn't that the club

07:00.064 --> 07:01.964
where the guys wear
all the leather and stuff?

07:01.966 --> 07:03.165
(Larissa) Absolutely.

07:03.167 --> 07:05.834
Leather daddies.
Lots of muscle boys.

07:05.836 --> 07:08.437
And the city's
most outrageous drag queens,

07:08.439 --> 07:09.771
including a Joan Collins

07:09.773 --> 07:12.140
who out-Joan Collinses
Joan Collins.

07:12.142 --> 07:14.042
Hmm. Sounds, uh, scary.

07:14.044 --> 07:16.144
It's not.
It's fun and outrageous.

07:16.146 --> 07:17.446
Walt and I are in.

07:17.448 --> 07:19.948
Well, Valentine's Day
at Boy it is.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.717
Well, you guys have fun.
As I have mentioned,

07:22.719 --> 07:25.654
Sebastian and I
have a romantic dinner planned.

07:25.656 --> 07:28.223
Ugh. The only thing worse
than a happy couple,

07:28.225 --> 07:30.358
is a happy couple
on Valentine's Day.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.826
(Stifles laugh)
It's disgusting.

07:31.828 --> 07:33.828
I would love to go to boy
and show off my skills,

07:33.830 --> 07:35.730
but Sebastian would kill me
if I canceled.

07:35.732 --> 07:36.698
(Record needle scratches)

07:36.700 --> 07:38.266
What do you mean
you're canceling?

07:38.268 --> 07:39.434
Sorry, Carrie.

07:39.436 --> 07:41.236
But Tony's only in town
for that one night.

07:41.238 --> 07:43.860
I'm gonna pitch him some
of my ideas, and if he likes 'em,

07:43.980 --> 07:46.207
he might put me in contact
with some people in California.

07:46.209 --> 07:47.309
Wait a sec.

07:47.311 --> 07:50.245
You're canceling
our Valentine's dinner

07:50.247 --> 07:53.114
for that skateboarding thing?

07:53.116 --> 07:54.582
You're joking, right?

07:56.000 --> 08:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:10.339 --> 08:11.706
More flowers from Harlan?

08:11.708 --> 08:13.374
Really, this is just overkill.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.376
I mean, has he no respect
for the fact

08:15.378 --> 08:17.745
that I actually have a job
to do on this desk?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.014
Get someone to clear all this
and tell Janet

08:20.016 --> 08:21.816
to make me a cappuccino
while you're at it.

08:21.818 --> 08:24.619
Hopefully, this won't be him
trying his hand at poetry again.

08:24.621 --> 08:26.154
Oh! Oh, no, Carrie.

08:26.156 --> 08:27.488
Hang on.
This one's for you.

08:27.490 --> 08:28.990
Looks like
someone's feeling guilty.

08:28.992 --> 08:31.292
"Sorry about tonight.
Happy Valentine's Day.

08:31.294 --> 08:33.027
Love, Sebastian."

08:33.029 --> 08:34.729
Well, he <i>should</i> feel guilty.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.832
Not only did he cancel
our Valentine's Day plans,

08:37.833 --> 08:39.033
but he's using

08:39.034 --> 08:41.202
our One If By Land,
Two If By Sea reservation

08:41.203 --> 08:44.038
for his meeting
with that Tony Eagle guy.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.640
Thank you.
Can you believe it?

08:45.642 --> 08:46.774
Mm, I can.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.609
If only because you've told me
so many times,

08:48.611 --> 08:51.479
the sheer repetition
has convinced me.

08:51.481 --> 08:53.881
Honestly, all this fuss
over a dreadful holiday

08:53.883 --> 08:55.950
where you're meant to
stuff yourself with chocolates

08:55.952 --> 08:57.385
and a huge dinner,

08:57.387 --> 08:59.387
and then shag
once you're good and bloated?

08:59.389 --> 09:01.222
I mean, it makes no sense
to me at all.

09:01.224 --> 09:02.790
Well, that's easy for you
to say.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.925
Harlan is out of the country
for a good reason...

09:04.927 --> 09:06.560
A real job
that he actually has.

09:06.562 --> 09:09.296
Please. I'm fairly sure
he faked his business meeting

09:09.298 --> 09:11.932
in Budapest to get out
of the Valentine's pressure.

09:11.934 --> 09:13.734
- Really?
- Put it this way...

09:13.736 --> 09:15.102
when I asked
what the meeting was,

09:15.104 --> 09:17.504
he said something about
Hungary's top goulash company

09:17.506 --> 09:19.273
buying another goulash company.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.442
I mean, he's probably golfing
somewhere tropical.

09:21.444 --> 09:22.409
But I don't mind.

09:22.411 --> 09:23.644
You really don't, do you?

09:23.646 --> 09:24.912
(Scoffs)

09:24.914 --> 09:26.780
Why can't I be like that?

09:26.782 --> 09:27.815
Because no one can be me.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.450
Seriously, I thought
you'd be happy

09:29.452 --> 09:31.285
that Sebastian
has his own thing going on.

09:31.287 --> 09:33.921
He is handsome, he is rich,
<i>and</i> he's ambitious?

09:33.923 --> 09:35.355
He's a one-man dream team.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.925
Yeah...

09:37.927 --> 09:39.092
But skateboarding?

09:39.094 --> 09:40.561
I mean,
that's not a real business.

09:40.563 --> 09:42.296
There's no way
that's going anywhere.

09:42.298 --> 09:43.697
It's... it's a fad.

09:43.699 --> 09:45.165
But I can't say that to him.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.534
So I just have to sit there
with a fake smile on my face,

09:47.536 --> 09:49.570
while he drones on and on
about something called

09:49.572 --> 09:52.773
a "McTwist" and blows me off
on Valentine's Day.

09:52.775 --> 09:54.841
Trust me,
Valentine's Day's bollocks.

09:54.843 --> 09:57.644
You're gonna have a much better
time at Boy tonight.

09:57.646 --> 09:59.079
I guess.

09:59.081 --> 10:01.148
There is simply nothing better
than getting attention

10:01.150 --> 10:03.617
from beautiful men
who don't wanna sleep with you.

10:03.619 --> 10:05.519
It's much more meaningful.

10:07.488 --> 10:09.790
<i>And while</i>
<i>I adjusted my expectations</i>

10:09.792 --> 10:11.825
<i>for the night,</i>

10:11.827 --> 10:14.694
Maggie shifted her expectations
<i>for her future.</i>

10:14.696 --> 10:16.830
Uh, hi there.

10:16.832 --> 10:17.831
What's your name?

10:17.833 --> 10:19.666
Uh, Maggie.

10:19.668 --> 10:21.334
Maggie Landers.

10:21.336 --> 10:22.802
Happy Valentine's Day.

10:22.804 --> 10:26.139
"Private Landers."
It's got a nice ring to it.

10:26.141 --> 10:27.340
(Chuckles)

10:27.342 --> 10:28.541
You ever consider joining
the armed forces?

10:28.543 --> 10:30.744
What? Oh! No. No, no.

10:30.746 --> 10:32.412
Trust me, you don't want me
defending the country.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.680
And have you heard of
the G.I. Bill?

10:33.682 --> 10:36.149
You can go to college
all on the army's dime.

10:36.151 --> 10:37.550
Well, I-I was thinking
about college,

10:37.552 --> 10:39.019
but I don't even know
what I'd study.

10:39.021 --> 10:40.520
Oh, I was just like you.

10:40.522 --> 10:42.822
That's what's so great
about the army.

10:42.824 --> 10:44.758
Lots of people find their focus
while they're here.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.593
We can help you
figure out your future.

10:46.595 --> 10:48.695
Huh.

10:48.697 --> 10:50.396
- That sounds good.
- Yeah.

10:50.398 --> 10:52.699
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

10:52.701 --> 10:55.168
Let me ask you something.
Do you like to travel?

10:55.170 --> 10:56.970
Sure.
Everybody likes to travel.

10:56.972 --> 10:59.372
Did you know we have bases
all around the world?

10:59.374 --> 11:00.974
You can get stationed
in Europe.

11:00.976 --> 11:02.208
Or even Hawaii.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.410
Hawaii?

11:09.216 --> 11:10.650
(Chuckles)

11:10.652 --> 11:12.985
Heart-shaped pizza.
(Chuckles)

11:12.987 --> 11:14.954
That is officially overkill.

11:14.956 --> 11:16.222
Yeah.

11:16.224 --> 11:18.891
So, uh, what's on the agenda
for you and your... friend?

11:18.893 --> 11:19.992
Oh. Mnh-mnh.

11:19.994 --> 11:22.395
- Did you guys break up?
- No.

11:22.397 --> 11:24.096
No, we're just spending tonight

11:24.098 --> 11:26.799
with about a thousand other guys
at this really loud club,

11:26.801 --> 11:29.869
where everyone's really...
loud.

11:29.871 --> 11:31.571
And it's not really
how I imagined

11:31.573 --> 11:32.872
spending my Valentine's Day.

11:32.874 --> 11:34.607
Yeah, I can relate.

11:34.609 --> 11:36.142
You can?

11:36.144 --> 11:40.246
Well, not to all the specifics,
but, uh, yeah, yeah.

11:40.248 --> 11:41.647
I mean, I always thought

11:41.649 --> 11:43.549
that I'd spend Valentine's Day
with Grace

11:43.551 --> 11:47.286
for the rest of my life,
and here I am.

11:47.288 --> 11:48.421
I just have
to make the best of it

11:48.423 --> 11:50.489
with
this hideously shaped pizza.

11:50.491 --> 11:51.891
Pretty sure your night
sounds better than mine.

11:51.893 --> 11:53.225
Ah, think again.

11:53.227 --> 11:56.128
I have to spend it with Dorrit
and this guy Scott.

11:56.130 --> 11:58.330
They're watching violent
and depressing movies,

11:58.332 --> 12:00.266
because they both hate
Valentine's Day.

12:00.268 --> 12:02.067
- And you're chaperoning?
- Yeah.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.370
I mean Dorrit claims
that they're just friends,

12:04.372 --> 12:06.138
but I'm not buying it.

12:06.140 --> 12:08.674
Yeah, a guy wants to hang out
with a girl on Valentine's Day,

12:08.676 --> 12:09.875
he likes her.

12:09.877 --> 12:11.143
That's what I'm thinking.
(Chuckles)

12:11.145 --> 12:12.611
I'm also thinking
that she's lying to me,

12:12.613 --> 12:14.179
because of what happened
with her last boyfriend.

12:14.181 --> 12:16.115
I mean, you have one or two
jam sessions with a kid,

12:16.117 --> 12:17.182
and all of a sudden,

12:17.184 --> 12:19.485
you've overstepped
your bounds as a father.

12:19.487 --> 12:20.919
I kinda think you might have.

12:20.921 --> 12:24.189
Maybe.
But on the bright side,

12:24.191 --> 12:25.691
I now have a surefire way

12:25.693 --> 12:28.761
of driving out
undesirable suitors.

12:28.763 --> 12:30.796
If I like 'em, they're gone.

12:30.798 --> 12:32.364
Wow. That is power.

12:32.366 --> 12:34.399

I'll take what I can get.

Sure, but, uh, maybe later?

13:27.354 --> 13:30.955

I'll get you some ice
before I head out.

14:03.561 --> 14:05.694
You did not
just check your watch.

14:05.696 --> 14:07.963
Carrie,
don't turn this into a thing.

14:07.965 --> 14:09.565
You know I got a big meeting.

14:09.567 --> 14:10.799
How could I forget?

14:10.801 --> 14:13.368
It's all you've
talked about for a week.

14:13.370 --> 14:16.572
Well, excuse me
for injuring myself

14:16.574 --> 14:18.273
on one of
your stupid skateboards

14:18.275 --> 14:21.718
and making you late
for your cockamamy meeting.

14:21.838 --> 14:24.212
"Cockamamy meeting"?
(Huffs)

14:24.214 --> 14:25.781
You think what
I'm working on is stupid?

14:25.783 --> 14:28.083
No, it's just...

14:28.085 --> 14:31.153
A company that makes clothes
for skateboarding?

14:31.155 --> 14:32.854
How is that gonna be
something real?

14:32.856 --> 14:35.057
You did not just say that.

14:38.694 --> 14:40.829
You joined the army?!

14:40.831 --> 14:42.097
What were you thinking?

14:42.099 --> 14:43.365
They'll pay for college.

14:43.367 --> 14:46.234
Then I will get to live for
free... in the barracks.

14:46.236 --> 14:47.802
Then I'll get stationed
somewhere cool...

14:47.804 --> 14:50.405
Or cold or rainy
or dusty or all three.

14:50.407 --> 14:52.407
It'll provide me
with structure.

14:52.409 --> 14:54.542
Yeah, you're gonna have to
wake up at 5:00 in the morning

14:54.544 --> 14:56.578
<i>- every day.</i>
- Every day?

14:56.580 --> 14:57.812
And they're gonna
cut your hair.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.648
Short.

14:59.650 --> 15:00.982
Boy short.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.151
Don't you remember crying
every day for, like, a week

15:03.153 --> 15:05.286
after you got the Dorothy Hamill
in fifth grade?

15:05.288 --> 15:07.989
Yeah, well,
I'm... I'm much more mature now.

15:07.991 --> 15:11.526
Can you even do a push up?
Sure.

15:11.528 --> 15:13.161
Not a girl one.
Then no.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.730
Mags, the army is great
for many people.

15:15.732 --> 15:17.599
You are not one of them!

15:17.601 --> 15:19.667
This is not some
"Private Benjamin" fantasy,

15:19.669 --> 15:21.169
and you are not Goldie Hawn!

15:21.171 --> 15:23.371
Oh, my God, Mouse.
I joined the army.

15:23.373 --> 15:26.140
You have to help me
out of this.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.509
I'm gonna come up with a plan.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.911
(Maggie) This is your plan?

15:29.913 --> 15:31.145
(Mouse) She has a car

15:31.147 --> 15:34.182
and an innate ability
to gain access to, well,

15:34.184 --> 15:35.817
- anywhere.
- It's true.

15:35.819 --> 15:38.886
This rack
is an all-access pass.

15:38.888 --> 15:41.656
So your plan is to have
fun-bags McGee

15:41.658 --> 15:43.191
talk us onto the base?

15:43.193 --> 15:45.193
And then we'll find this
Private Watson

15:45.195 --> 15:47.328
and convince him to rip up
your paperwork.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.230
(Mouth full)
This is a lousy idea.

15:49.232 --> 15:50.898
You got a better one?

15:50.900 --> 15:52.467
Of course you don't.

15:52.469 --> 15:55.736
So shut your mouth,
and let my tatas do the talking.

15:55.738 --> 15:57.238
I have rules for the car...

15:57.240 --> 15:59.407
No eating and I rule the radio.

16:01.376 --> 16:03.044
(Sebastian) So you think what
I'm doing with my life

16:03.046 --> 16:05.279
- right now is pointless?
- I just, I mean...

16:05.281 --> 16:07.248
How much do you even know
about this Tony guy?

16:07.250 --> 16:08.616
Isn't he, like, 18?

16:08.618 --> 16:11.952
Does he really have connections
that are all that important?

16:11.954 --> 16:13.187
He's the real deal.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.822
And you'd knt
if you bothered to look into it.

16:14.824 --> 16:15.790
Which would be easy
for you to do,

16:15.792 --> 16:17.224
since you work at a magazine.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.826
But I guess since skateboarding
doesn't interest you,

16:18.828 --> 16:20.194
it's not worth doing.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.530
It's like you don't even
want me to have my own life.

16:22.532 --> 16:24.031
Of course I do,

16:24.033 --> 16:26.333
just not at the expense
of our relationship.

16:26.335 --> 16:27.868
Oh, come...
for God sake, Carrie.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.770
Valentine's Day
is not that important.

16:29.772 --> 16:32.773
- It's not just about Valentine's Day.
- Then what is it?

16:32.775 --> 16:35.476
You said you'd move.

16:35.478 --> 16:37.211
I heard it.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.612
(Knock on door)

16:38.614 --> 16:39.747
Look...
It's Walt.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.048
Look, Carrie...
Come in!

16:43.318 --> 16:44.418
Hey, guys.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.519
Hey.

16:45.521 --> 16:46.954
Look, I can't be late to this.
But...

16:46.956 --> 16:48.355
But nothing. Okay?

16:48.357 --> 16:50.257
What we were talking about...
it wasn't important anyway.

16:51.935 --> 16:52.881
Did I interrupt?

16:53.001 --> 16:54.194
- Yes. It's okay.
- No.

16:54.196 --> 16:55.796
Of course it's okay
because you have to leave.

16:55.798 --> 16:57.564
- Carrie!
- Just go.

16:57.566 --> 17:00.067
Fine.

17:03.138 --> 17:04.538
(Door closes)

17:04.540 --> 17:06.440
- What just happened?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.009
I... my boyfriend is just
super-duper busy

17:09.011 --> 17:10.810
and has a big life,
and so do I.

17:10.813 --> 17:12.813
So let's get the hell
out of here

17:12.815 --> 17:13.946
and go do some partying.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.449
Okay.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.017
Um, in just a minute.

17:17.019 --> 17:18.585
I-I don't wanna run into him
on the stairs.

17:18.587 --> 17:20.119
Right. Right.

19:20.986 --> 19:22.719
I know this is gonna
sound a little odd,

19:22.721 --> 19:25.489
but I think this place is

19:25.491 --> 19:27.457
- Oh. <i>Too</i> gay for you?
- Yes.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.592
I hate to break it
to you, Walt,

19:28.594 --> 19:29.826
but you've had sex with a man.

19:29.828 --> 19:31.928
That makes you just as gay
as everyone else here.

19:31.930 --> 19:34.264
Mm. (Chuckles)
There is a guy here

19:34.266 --> 19:36.700
wearing nothing
but an enormous peacock feather.

19:36.702 --> 19:38.735
And I think he might be
one of the less flamboyant ones.

19:38.737 --> 19:40.070
He's just being himself.

19:40.072 --> 19:41.771
It's a little more of him
than I was hoping for.

19:41.773 --> 19:44.908
It's Valentine's Day.
People are just letting loose.

19:44.910 --> 19:46.209
But this isn't how I wanted us

19:46.211 --> 19:47.811
to spend <i>our</i> first
Valentine's Day.

19:47.813 --> 19:49.045

19:49.047 --> 19:50.880
who I have
nothing in common with,

19:50.882 --> 19:52.115
except for being gay.

19:52.117 --> 19:53.483
Walt, we live in a world
that thinks people like us

19:53.485 --> 19:55.718
shouldn't be allowed
to love each other.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.387
That fact bonds you
to every guy here,

19:57.389 --> 19:58.521
no matter what he's wearing.

19:58.523 --> 20:01.124
Doesn't mean we can't go
to a romantic restaurant

20:01.126 --> 20:03.293
- on Valentine's Day.
- Sure, we could.

20:03.295 --> 20:05.328
But why would we want
all that conventional stuff?

20:05.330 --> 20:08.031
Overpriced chocolates
on February 14th?

20:08.033 --> 20:10.900
Marriage? Kids?
The white picket fence?

20:10.902 --> 20:12.936
We're not allowed
to have that, so screw it.

Tonight is about celebrating us
and what we <i>can</i> have,

20:15.807 --> 20:17.240
which is each other.

20:17.242 --> 20:18.341
And some disco music.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.077
I know we can't have
all that stuff.

20:21.079 --> 20:22.912
But...
(Laughs)

20:22.914 --> 20:25.314

- Does it have to be <i>this?</i>

20:25.316 --> 20:26.682

20:26.684 --> 20:28.885
just give me one song out there

20:28.887 --> 20:31.454
And if you're not having fun
by the end of it,

20:31.456 --> 20:34.624
I'll wear the peacock feather
to work for a week.

I.D. Please.

I'm afraid your name
isn't on the visitation list.

21:30.881 --> 21:32.147
(Under breath) Told you.

21:32.149 --> 21:36.452
Ugh. My cousin always forgets
to give the gate my name.

21:36.454 --> 21:38.220
(Sighs deeply)
Can you believe it?

21:38.222 --> 21:40.956
You wouldn't forget me,
would you?

21:40.958 --> 21:41.924
Definitely not.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.494
But, uh, I'm sorry,
I can't let you in,

21:45.496 --> 21:47.162
as much as I'd like to.

21:47.164 --> 21:50.332
(Voice breaking)
Okay, I understand.

21:53.002 --> 21:57.372
I'm afraid I wasn't...
totally honest with you.

21:57.374 --> 22:00.142
The truth is,
I'm not just here to visit.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.244
(Cries) I'm here to deliver
some very tragic news

22:02.246 --> 22:03.645

devastating to Richard.

22:07.885 --> 22:09.584
Robert.

22:09.586 --> 22:13.221
You see, our grandmother's
been in the hospital,

22:13.223 --> 22:16.024

the poor woman passed on.

22:16.026 --> 22:17.159

22:17.161 --> 22:19.327
I just wanted to tell him
in person.

22:19.329 --> 22:21.363
(Crying) He loved her so much.

22:21.365 --> 22:24.199
Listen, please, please,
don't... don't... don't do that.

22:24.201 --> 22:27.168
I hate to see a pretty girl cry.
(Crying)

22:27.170 --> 22:29.905
Listen, you all hurry in

22:29.907 --> 22:32.507
and wait in the recruitment
office, all right?

22:32.509 --> 22:36.311
I-I'll find Private Watson.
It'll be all right.

an entire afternoon

23:12.148 --> 23:13.414

23:13.416 --> 23:14.949
We lost track after, like, 200.

23:14.951 --> 23:16.884
Awesome. But can we agree
to never mention

23:16.886 --> 23:18.686
that dirtbag Nick again?

23:18.688 --> 23:19.887
Agreed.

23:19.889 --> 23:23.191
You know, we're not really close
at all anymore.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.759
You'd better not be.

23:25.861 --> 23:27.161

23:31.167 --> 23:33.167
"The Killing Fields."

23:33.169 --> 23:35.136

23:46.949 --> 23:48.516

23:49.652 --> 23:51.185
Chad probably dumped her again.

23:51.187 --> 23:54.088
Valentine's Day
is heinous baveinous.

23:54.090 --> 23:55.489
I know.

23:55.491 --> 23:57.091
Way too many expectations
about what the night should be.

23:57.093 --> 23:58.459
I'll take it upstairs.

23:58.461 --> 24:00.561
Sorry, this could take a while.

24:00.563 --> 24:03.164
No problem.

24:07.869 --> 24:13.073
(Under breath)
Stay cool, man. Stay cool.

24:16.244 --> 24:19.713
(Sniffs)

24:19.715 --> 24:21.915
(Exhales and sniffs)

24:25.487 --> 24:28.655
(Under breath)
If you pull out drugs, bub...

24:36.064 --> 24:37.231
Hey.

24:37.233 --> 24:39.867
Hey. Hi. (Chuckles)

24:39.869 --> 24:44.037
I-I just, uh, wanted to see
if, uh, you, uh,

24:44.039 --> 24:45.472
you wanted some more popcorn?

24:45.474 --> 24:47.674
No, thanks, uh,
Mr. Bradshaw.

24:47.676 --> 24:48.842
You play?

24:48.844 --> 24:50.744
Yeah, since I was 5.

24:50.746 --> 24:53.080
I play tennis,
run cross-country.

24:53.082 --> 24:54.548
Saw me lining up
the strings, huh?

24:54.550 --> 24:56.149
I get a little obsessive
about that.

24:56.151 --> 24:57.451
I know it's weird.

24:57.453 --> 25:00.087
No, I get it. I mean,
uh, for me it's coat hangers.

25:00.089 --> 25:02.355
You know,
two finger spaces apart.

25:02.357 --> 25:03.757
Sounds perfectly reasonable
to me.

25:03.759 --> 25:06.093
Sometimes it's the, uh,
little details.

25:06.095 --> 25:08.895
Exactly.
Dorrit thinks it's lame.

25:08.897 --> 25:10.564
Please don't tell her I'm anal.

25:10.566 --> 25:13.066
Then she'll never look at me...

25:13.068 --> 25:16.436
I mean, I don't, uh...
(Chuckles)

25:16.438 --> 25:17.771
We're... we're just friends.

25:17.773 --> 25:19.940
What are you doing
out of the kitchen?

25:19.942 --> 25:23.243
I'm just on popcorn refill duty.
Yep, heading back to my work.

25:23.245 --> 25:24.611
Let's watch "Scarface."

25:24.613 --> 25:25.912
I wanna check your math.

25:25.914 --> 25:27.580
Okay.

25:30.651 --> 25:32.552
(Men cheering and whistling)

25:32.554 --> 25:35.789
Look at those Tampa airport
stripper moves of hers.

25:35.791 --> 25:37.290
I think they're mocking her.

25:37.292 --> 25:38.691
Carrie, don't you think so?

25:38.693 --> 25:40.860
Uh, they seem
pretty into it to me.

25:40.862 --> 25:42.095
This won't do at all.

25:42.097 --> 25:43.963
What do you care?
You're engaged.

25:43.965 --> 25:46.466
Yeah, to a heterosexual male.
There's no triumph

25:46.468 --> 25:48.568
in getting the attention
of a man you're shagging.

25:48.570 --> 25:50.637
- It's too easy.
- Not for me.

25:50.639 --> 25:52.805
I think Sebastian
would pay more attention

25:52.807 --> 25:55.341
if I dressed up in
a giant skateboard costume.

25:55.343 --> 25:56.576
This is a travesty.

25:56.578 --> 25:58.611
I mean, I'm right here
in Thierry Mugler, no less.

25:58.613 --> 26:00.446
And no one...
no one is paying attention.

26:00.448 --> 26:01.714
It's not really a fair fight.

26:01.716 --> 26:03.049
I mean, Samantha's on a horse.

26:03.051 --> 26:04.417
Yes, she is.

Oh, man!

26:36.317 --> 26:38.284
I'm turning straight

26:38.286 --> 26:40.519
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

26:40.521 --> 26:41.787
Sorry, Larissa.

Catfight! Catfight!

26:51.866 --> 26:53.232
That's enough, ladies!

26:53.234 --> 26:54.366
It's time for you to go.

26:54.368 --> 26:55.801
Who are you to tell me
I have to go?

26:55.803 --> 26:57.169
I'm the bouncer, bitch.

27:05.346 --> 27:09.748
What's taking so long?
I bet they're onto us.

Nice. Make it about you,

27:16.691 --> 27:18.490
Hey, you're the dum-dum
who got yourself into this mess.

27:18.492 --> 27:19.825
If it were up to me,

27:19.827 --> 27:21.560
I'd send you straight

27:22.830 --> 27:25.464
Fighting is not
going to help us right now.

What are you doing?

27:26.901 --> 27:28.133
You're right.
They're onto us.

27:28.135 --> 27:30.369
I'm gonna find your file
and rip it up myself.

27:30.371 --> 27:33.605
So these are alphabetical...

27:33.607 --> 27:35.707
New recruits.

27:35.709 --> 27:37.876
Let's see... (Sighs)

27:37.878 --> 27:40.579
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

27:40.581 --> 27:42.915
Those files are
the official property

27:48.756 --> 27:50.889
Okay, Bennet. You win.

27:50.891 --> 27:52.257
This place is pretty fun.

27:52.259 --> 27:54.393
And I had a nice conversation
with the peacock guy.

27:54.395 --> 27:56.428
His name is Jeremy,
and he's an accountant,

27:56.430 --> 27:58.063
and he gave me some tax advice.

27:58.065 --> 27:59.197
Not that I file taxes yet.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.099
I'm not gonna say
I told you so...

28:01.101 --> 28:03.301
So I'll say it.
I told you so.

28:03.303 --> 28:05.170
Yeah, okay.
I deserve it.

28:05.172 --> 28:07.239
I was being a total jerk
for judging these guys.

28:07.241 --> 28:09.074
That's okay. You're, like,
barely out of the closet.

28:09.076 --> 28:11.376
And it was a deep, deep,
like, walk-in closet.

28:11.378 --> 28:13.044
So cut yourself some slack.

28:13.046 --> 28:14.913
Whoa!

28:14.915 --> 28:16.014
Oh!

28:16.016 --> 28:17.549
Martin. Hey.

28:17.551 --> 28:19.184
Bennet.

28:19.186 --> 28:21.286
Martin, this is my
friend Carrie... hi!

28:21.288 --> 28:22.554
And Walt, my boyfriend.

28:22.556 --> 28:24.456
Martin's a good friend
of my ex, Eric.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.991
How's he doing, by the way?
Is he still... traveling?

28:26.993 --> 28:28.360
So you haven't heard?

28:28.362 --> 28:29.461
Heard what?

28:29.463 --> 28:31.529
Oh, God. Um...

28:31.531 --> 28:33.398
I told you him
that he needed to call you.

28:33.400 --> 28:37.035
He's been in total denial.

28:37.037 --> 28:38.203
He has it.

28:38.205 --> 28:40.905
He was just diagnosed.

28:40.907 --> 28:43.007
Eric is dying of AIDS.

28:43.009 --> 28:44.843
Oh, my God.

29:07.807 --> 29:09.741
Don't. Not now.
Walt, I know you're scared.

29:09.743 --> 29:11.209
Believe me, I am, too.

29:11.211 --> 29:13.044
But there's no use completely
freaking out right now.

29:13.046 --> 29:15.280
- We can both go get tested tomorrow.
- Don't tell me not to freak out right now.

29:15.282 --> 29:16.781

even though you might have
given it to me?

29:22.022 --> 29:24.489
Don't worry because it's okay.
There's a test I can take

29:24.491 --> 29:26.424
to find out whether or not
I'm gonna die?

29:26.426 --> 29:28.259
- And I should calm down?
- You know what?

29:28.261 --> 29:29.360

I knew this was a bad idea.

29:34.601 --> 29:36.334
I didn't wanna come here
tonight!

29:36.336 --> 29:37.368
I knew I'd hate it!

Yeah, we didn't make it
through "The Killing Fields"

29:57.657 --> 29:59.757
it was too depressing,

30:03.996 --> 30:07.398
That's weird. For what?

30:07.400 --> 30:08.899
Well, for having
the good judgment

30:08.901 --> 30:10.034
to know not to get involved

30:10.036 --> 30:11.735
with this Scott fellow
romantically.

30:11.737 --> 30:14.305
Really? Why?

30:14.307 --> 30:16.307
I kept my eye on him.

30:16.309 --> 30:19.410
And let's just say
that I think he could be...

30:19.412 --> 30:20.511
Dangerous.

30:20.513 --> 30:22.680
(Scoffs) Dangerous?

30:22.682 --> 30:24.515
Mm-hmm.
Scott?

30:24.517 --> 30:25.783
Yeah, I know he seems like
a nice kid,

30:25.785 --> 30:27.851
but I can just tell.

30:27.853 --> 30:29.086
I've seen it before.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.421
And those kind of guys
are the worst trouble.

30:30.423 --> 30:32.256
All right, in fact,
I don't really even want you

30:32.258 --> 30:33.824
seeing him at all,
even as a friend.

30:33.826 --> 30:36.527
I just... think he's...

30:36.529 --> 30:39.063
A bad influence.

30:39.065 --> 30:41.799
Who do you think you are,

30:41.801 --> 30:44.101
telling me who I can
and can't date?

30:44.103 --> 30:45.302
Date?

30:45.304 --> 30:47.504
- Well, I-I thought you guys were friends?
- No!

30:47.506 --> 30:51.275
I mean, yes, we are,
but it's just like...

30:51.277 --> 30:52.276
On principle.

30:52.278 --> 30:53.443
And if I did decide
to date him,

30:53.445 --> 30:54.845
you couldn't stop me.

30:55.847 --> 30:57.714
Over my dead body!

30:57.716 --> 31:01.785

31:02.921 --> 31:04.021
Officer...

31:04.023 --> 31:05.289
Can't you just let us go,
and we'll pretend

31:05.291 --> 31:06.590
this never happened?

31:06.592 --> 31:08.558
If... if you'd just...
You can't arrest us!

31:08.560 --> 31:10.894
You know, I'm going to Harvard,
and if they find out,

31:10.896 --> 31:12.596
they're going to cut me,
and my life will be over.

31:12.598 --> 31:13.563
Shh. Mouse.

31:13.565 --> 31:16.533
I've never been in trouble,
ever.

31:16.535 --> 31:18.869
I've never even skipped a class,
even on skip day.

31:18.871 --> 31:21.571
They had to hire a sub
to sit in study hall with me,

31:21.573 --> 31:24.407
and I think
she was really annoyed.

31:24.409 --> 31:27.677
Spare me the sob story
and the sexpot dramatics.

31:27.679 --> 31:31.014
I'm sure that's how you
sweet-talked Sergeant Boyce

31:31.016 --> 31:32.682
into letting you on base,
but it won't work on me.

31:32.684 --> 31:35.352
I know all the techniques.
I've got two sisters.

31:35.354 --> 31:38.655
Two sisters.
I've got two brothers.

31:38.657 --> 31:40.290
But I learned nothing
from that,

31:40.292 --> 31:42.459
except that I love football
and college basketball.

31:42.461 --> 31:43.493
Really?

31:43.495 --> 31:45.061
Yeah.
Big East all the way.

31:45.063 --> 31:46.363
You're crazy.
Big Ten or nothing.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.470
But I'm still filing a report.

31:53.472 --> 31:55.171
Listen, this is all my fault.

31:55.173 --> 31:56.773
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's not.

31:56.775 --> 31:59.709
She was just trying to help me
because I freaked out

31:59.711 --> 32:02.478
about my future,
or lack thereof,

32:02.480 --> 32:05.682
and I joined the army
without thinking it through.

32:05.684 --> 32:07.183
She tried to clean up my mess,

32:07.185 --> 32:09.085
just like she's done
since elementary school,

32:09.087 --> 32:10.887
which is pretty cool of her.

32:11.855 --> 32:13.890
She doesn't deserve
to get arrested.

32:13.892 --> 32:16.426
And this one's a nightmare,
but she <i>probably</i> doesn't deserve

32:16.428 --> 32:18.127
to get arrested, either.

32:18.129 --> 32:19.762
Look...

to write a letter

32:38.483 --> 32:40.182
to the office saying
you changed your mind, right?

32:40.184 --> 32:41.684
Well, if we knew that,

32:41.686 --> 32:42.985
we wouldn't be here now,
would we?

32:42.987 --> 32:44.553
Okay, know when
to shut up, Mouse.

32:44.555 --> 32:46.088
Yeah, skank's right.
Let's go.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.728
Thanks. That was really
cool of you.

32:52.730 --> 32:53.996

33:00.671 --> 33:01.804

33:01.806 --> 33:04.874

take our names?

33:04.876 --> 33:06.075

I'm being too out of line,

33:07.945 --> 33:09.478

33:09.480 --> 33:10.880
So I can ask you out?

33:10.882 --> 33:12.381
Oh.

33:12.383 --> 33:16.318

Yes, absolutely. (Chuckles)

34:05.202 --> 34:08.804
Bennet's ex-boyfriend
has AIDS,

34:08.806 --> 34:10.871
and so now Bennet
could have it,

34:10.873 --> 34:12.674
which means Walt could have it.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.543
And... we found out
at the club.

34:15.545 --> 34:22.384
And then Walt ran away,
and I can't find him anywhere.

34:22.386 --> 34:24.719
(Crying) And I thought
he might be here,

34:24.721 --> 34:28.989
and I wanted to call the house
to see if he was there,

34:28.992 --> 34:31.826
but if I do,
then my dad will answer,

34:31.828 --> 34:35.730
and... and I'll have to
tell him.

34:35.732 --> 34:38.033

I really need you right now,

34:41.038 --> 34:43.605
because I don't know
what to do.

34:43.607 --> 34:44.839
And I just... I need you.

34:44.841 --> 34:48.777
I'm here. I'm here for you.
Okay? Okay.

34:48.779 --> 34:50.277

(Chuckles)

36:00.709 --> 36:01.774

36:01.776 --> 36:03.576

of my life.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.545
So, first things first.

36:05.547 --> 36:08.715
I got my results back yesterday.
They're negative.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.217
I assume
you got good news, too.

36:11.219 --> 36:12.218
Yeah, I did.

36:12.220 --> 36:14.487
(Sighs) That's great.

36:14.489 --> 36:16.255
We're so lucky, Walt.

36:16.257 --> 36:17.423
Lucky?

36:17.425 --> 36:19.859
Yeah.

36:19.861 --> 36:23.296
I went to visit Eric
in the hospital.

36:23.298 --> 36:24.263
It's pretty brutal.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.399
Sorry, Bennet.

36:26.401 --> 36:27.600
Yeah, he's, uh...

36:27.602 --> 36:30.136
(Voice breaks)
He's got pneumonia,

36:30.138 --> 36:32.572
and the virus has invaded
his brain.

36:34.174 --> 36:36.409
He didn't even know
I was there half the time.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.244
And...

36:38.246 --> 36:43.949
Maybe it's better that
he doesn't know what's going on.

36:43.951 --> 36:46.986
They can't help him anymore.
He's just...

36:46.988 --> 36:48.788
- He's waiting to die...
- Stop!

36:48.790 --> 36:51.257
Okay, please? Just stop.
God, that's awful.

36:51.259 --> 36:54.460
I can't hear this.
I'm sorry.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.074
I know you're scared,
but we need to talk about it.

36:56.194 --> 36:58.297
I can't hear it, Bennet.
I'm only 18.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.465
I'm not supposed
to have to start thinking

36:59.467 --> 37:01.033

has barely started.

37:01.035 --> 37:02.668

37:14.448 --> 37:16.148
Would you please stop
calling it that?

37:16.150 --> 37:18.050
I am not part of any community.

37:19.386 --> 37:21.920
I knew this was
gonna be hard, coming out...

37:21.922 --> 37:23.756
That people would judge me,
even hate me...

37:23.758 --> 37:25.457
But I never thought
about everything

37:25.459 --> 37:26.625
that I'd have to give up.

37:31.098 --> 37:32.498

my wedding at the Waldorf.

I probably should've realized

37:38.706 --> 37:40.906

The white picket fence,
the family.

37:46.080 --> 37:49.014
That's stuff I can't have
if I'm gay.

37:51.818 --> 37:53.285
