00:19.519 --> 00:21.312
Oh, hi, dip-shirt.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.565
Hello, Bad Janet. How are you today?

00:23.648 --> 00:24.482
Terrible.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.112
I'm here to let you know
that after six months of captivity,

00:29.195 --> 00:33.199
here in Good Janet's void,
today's your last day.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.826
I'm gonna tell you a story.

00:34.909 --> 00:37.620
And once that's done,
I'm getting rid of you.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.205
Wow.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.292
Sounds like someone finally put on
his big-boy demon pants.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.044
So, what's the story?

00:44.127 --> 00:45.128
Another one of your attempts to prove

00:45.211 --> 00:48.757
that humans are "good"
and "worthy of respect"

00:48.840 --> 00:52.302
and not "big fat sacks of dookie"?

00:52.385 --> 00:53.511
Something like that.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.180
Are you ready?

00:55.263 --> 00:57.390
One thing, real quick, before you start...

01:12.989 --> 01:13.823
Wow.

01:14.741 --> 01:15.742
She's gonna last.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.869
Is that your story? Looks boring.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.663
This book is a part of the story.
You'll see.

01:20.747 --> 01:24.167
- Ugh.
-It all started about a week ago.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.795
We'd sent the four humans on a ski trip...

01:26.878 --> 01:29.923
And they all skied off a cliff
and they broke all their bones

01:30.006 --> 01:33.676
and their pants fell down
and you could see their butts. The end.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.013
Actually, it went better
than we could've possibly hoped.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.059
Well, I admit it. I was wrong.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.061
That was super fun!

01:43.144 --> 01:44.854
Yeah! I mean,
I couldn't actually go skiing,

01:44.938 --> 01:47.732
because moving at an angle terrifies me,

01:47.816 --> 01:50.276
-but that lodge had so many reading nooks.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.570
Just everywhere
you look... nook.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.698
Plus Jianyu guided us
on that amazing meditation.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.909
Oh, do you guys want to share
what your mantra is?

01:57.992 --> 02:01.246
Mine is Cate Blanchett saying, "Rihanna."

02:01.329 --> 02:03.373
Congrats again, on the gin rummy win.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.916
I thought I was gonna take you down,

02:04.999 --> 02:06.668
'cause I used to play all the time
back in college.

02:06.751 --> 02:07.919
Ah, you went to Rutgers, right?

02:08.002 --> 02:09.170
No, I went to Princeton.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.047
Yeah, I know. I'm messing with you.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.257
Oh.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.425
Nice one.
Hey, you were joking, though, right?

02:14.509 --> 02:16.511
You know it's Prince... Yeah, you know.

02:16.594 --> 02:19.514
Okay, team. Well done.

02:19.597 --> 02:23.351
They're all kinda killing it, but Brent
has definitely made the most progress.

02:23.434 --> 02:27.730
Yeah, when Simone beat him at cards,
he didn't flip the table and storm off.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.524
He just stormed off. That's big.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.901
Well, we still don't know
if he's really changed,

02:31.985 --> 02:33.695
or if he's just trying
to get into "super heaven."

02:33.778 --> 02:35.822
But his behavior's changing.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.365
Remember, that's the roadmap.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.910
First, we change the behavior,
then we work on motivation.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.996
-And now...
- Oh-ho-ho.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.582
...the moment you've all been waiting for.

02:45.665 --> 02:51.296
The humanity savior of the week goes to...

02:51.379 --> 02:52.422
-Jason!
-Aww.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.339
Yes!

02:53.423 --> 02:55.466
Keep up the amazing work with Chidi.

02:56.301 --> 03:02.015
And the award for
hottest savior of the week goes to...

03:02.098 --> 03:04.684
- Eleanor Shellstrop!
-Whoop-whoop!

03:04.767 --> 03:06.060
Thank you, I accept.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.437
I never win "hottest."

03:08.187 --> 03:09.022
I don't know what to tell you, man.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.733
Maybe do some squats.
Pop that booty a little bit.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.985
<i>It was a real high point.</i>

03:14.068 --> 03:17.697
The ski trip, I mean,
not the completely rigged hotness contest.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.240
-All in all, it was the best

03:19.324 --> 03:20.992
-we'd ever felt about the experiment.
-Ugh.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.369
And then Brent did something...

03:24.329 --> 03:25.413
very Brentian.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.707
Who could've
predicted that?

03:28.291 --> 03:30.251
Oh! Hey, ski bunnies.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.753
So, great news.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.673
I wrote a book,
and since you're my nerdiest friends,

03:35.757 --> 03:37.258
you get to be the first to read it.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.970
<i>"Six Feet Under Par:</i>
<i>A Chip Driver Mystery."</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:43.598
Yeah. It's half-spy novel,
half-murder mystery.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.601
It's also half-submarine adventure,
half-erotic memoir,

03:46.684 --> 03:47.977
and half-political thriller.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.814
It's also half-golf tutorial,
and half-commentary on society.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.358
So, it's three-and-a-half books in one?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.068
At least. So, read it ASAP.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.528
I'm having a book-signing party
and I want you to introduce me.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.239
-You know, talk about how great it is.
-Oh!

03:59.322 --> 04:01.282
Party's in two days, so chop-chop.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.952
Tahani. Cancel your plans.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.664
We're gonna split a bottle of wine
and read Brent's terrible novel out loud.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.915
Oh, dear.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.750
Perhaps we shouldn't make fun.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.253
He did seem nicer on the ski trip.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.921
He made us all s'mores.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.049
Though to be fair, he did also claim
to have invented them.

04:18.132 --> 04:22.303
Before you defend him, you might wanna
check out Chip Driver's love interest.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.348
Oh, no.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.268
"Her name was Scarlett Pakistan,

04:28.351 --> 04:33.439
and she was the type of girl you couldn't
take in all at once, or you'd die.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.651
You had to take her in bit by bit,
like a great work of art,

04:36.734 --> 04:37.694
like the Louvre."

04:37.777 --> 04:40.738
"Her brown eyes were as brown
as the brownest crayon.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.325
She had legs like Jessica Rabbit
from that movie."

04:44.409 --> 04:49.122
"Her long, flowing locks smelled like
the moon at twilight on a par four."

04:49.205 --> 04:50.248
Ugh.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.249
I'm sorry about this.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.875
I've been through worse.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.836
Once, at Elon Musk's birthday party,

04:54.919 --> 04:58.881
I was seated between Silvio Berlusconi
and Elon Musk.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.216
- This is bad.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.136
Brent and Simone
is our trickiest relationship.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.180
She tends to make
snap judgments about people,

05:06.264 --> 05:10.810
and he's a guy who repeatedly confirms
the accuracy of her snap judgments.

05:10.893 --> 05:15.815
We need her to believe that
Brent is better than his worst actions.

05:15.898 --> 05:19.444
Like saying that Tahani
"has an accent like the Queen of England,

05:19.527 --> 05:22.447
but without any of
the old, gross face parts."

05:22.530 --> 05:25.616
We felt like we could contain
the fallout from Brent's book.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.244
But as is often the case
with these things,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.288
the negative effects
started to ripple out.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.332
Oh. Like when someone throws up on a bus,

05:32.415 --> 05:33.916
and then someone smells it
and they throw up?

05:34.709 --> 05:35.752
Sure, yeah.

05:35.835 --> 05:36.836
What's wrong, homie?

05:36.919 --> 05:40.423
Oh, Brent wrote this book
and clearly, he put some of us in it.

05:40.506 --> 05:44.594
There's a cowardly character named
Four-Eyed Igby

05:44.677 --> 05:47.055
who "wears glasses and sweater-vests

05:47.138 --> 05:49.599
and never does anything
spontaneous or cool."

05:49.682 --> 05:52.393
I am educating you in ethics.
What could be cooler than that?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.271
If you want to try something spontaneous,
I'm your guy.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.648
Almost everything I did on Earth
I did without thinking,

05:57.732 --> 05:59.776
or worrying about what would happen.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.196
That's how I got my nickname,
The Defendant.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.531
Not the best argument, but you're right.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.576
What is something spontaneous
that I can do right now?

06:08.659 --> 06:10.745
Let's come up with a list
of ten possibilities,

06:10.828 --> 06:12.830
and then slowly whittle it down
over the next four days.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.874
Better idea, let's dance, baby.

06:14.957 --> 06:15.917
Hmm?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.629
Get you out of your head.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.757
This is how we defeat Igby,
the no-fun nerd.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.550
Yeah.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.220
-Look at ol' Igby move.
-There you go.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.306
I've never heard this before. Who is it?

06:30.389 --> 06:33.768
Me. I wrote it. This song is called,
"I'll Love You Forever,

06:34.352 --> 06:36.646
parentheses: (Make that Booty Bounce
in the Bath)."

06:36.729 --> 06:39.649
Oh. Fun fact, the police sirens
in the background are real.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.609
I was being chased as I recorded it.

06:42.193 --> 06:46.364
Okay. Okay. Oh, no...

06:46.447 --> 06:49.408
Oh, my Gaga.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.078
<i>So, obviously,</i>
<i>this was a troubling development.</i>

06:52.161 --> 06:54.288
Ugh! Can you just skip to the end?

06:54.372 --> 06:56.833
No. I need to tell you the whole story.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.628
Why? Every story about humans
ends the same way.

07:00.711 --> 07:03.089
Just tell me how they screwed up
and put me out of my misery.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.966
You're judging them too quickly.

07:05.049 --> 07:08.302
Trust me, I've spent
a lot more time with people than you have.

07:08.386 --> 07:12.056
And I know literally everything
that every one of them has ever done.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.350
Do you know
what's happening right now on Earth?

07:14.433 --> 07:20.148
Wars, murders, women in $400 yoga pants
are refusing to vaccinate their children.

07:20.231 --> 07:24.902
Vindictive nerds at Apple are changing
the charger cable shape again.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.946
Where does this hope come from, man?

07:27.029 --> 07:29.657
This insane hope
that people are worth the trouble.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.701
To quote a terrible song

07:31.784 --> 07:34.954
by a terrible musician
that people love so much

07:35.037 --> 07:37.373
they constantly put it
in terrible movie trailers,

07:37.457 --> 07:39.750
humans are "b-b-b-bad to the bone."

07:41.836 --> 07:44.839
Well, I think that they're
g-g-g-good sometimes,

07:44.922 --> 07:48.551
and you should give them
the b-b-b-benefit of the d-d-d-doubt.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.469
Now...

07:49.969 --> 07:51.053
Where was I?

07:51.637 --> 07:52.930
Ugh!

07:54.015 --> 07:58.019
So. John had just accidentally
discovered the truth about Jason.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.062
Keeping a secret like this is exactly

08:00.146 --> 08:02.523
the kind of thing
that John struggled with on Earth.

08:02.607 --> 08:07.236
Or to put it in terms you'll understand,
the gossip toilet was about to overflow.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.696
Oh.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.573
I do understand that now. Thank you.

08:10.656 --> 08:15.745
So, Jianyu is really Jason from Florida?

08:15.828 --> 08:17.038
Who else knows about this?

08:17.121 --> 08:20.082
Is it just me?
Is it an exclusive?

08:20.166 --> 08:22.126
Yes, and we
have to keep it that way.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.712
If the truth comes out,
we have no idea what will happen to Jason.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.964
You don't know what you're asking of me.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.342
Look, the neighborhood
is obviously amazing,

08:29.425 --> 08:32.845
but it's also a little
"Season 4 of <i>Downton Abbey." </i>

08:32.929 --> 08:35.139
Beautifully designed,
but a real snoozefest.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.058
Jason being a mistake

08:37.141 --> 08:40.228
is easily the most exciting thing
that's happened since we got here.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.815
What if, in exchange for your discretion,
Jason teaches you

08:44.899 --> 08:47.276
that <i>Magic Mike </i>body roll thing?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.071
Huh?

08:50.154 --> 08:52.156
I mean, you always said
you've wanted to learn that.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.784
-Fine.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.119
But I wanna learn the whole dance.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.664
<i>We'd hoped Simone</i>
<i>would forget all about Brent's book,</i>

08:59.747 --> 09:00.790
<i>but unfortunately...</i>

09:00.873 --> 09:05.086
"Chip Driver pulled up to the murder site
in his 1968 Cadillac.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.047
'Keep it close,' he growled
to the valet, Luis.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.924
'Of course, <i>señor,' </i>said Luis,

09:10.007 --> 09:13.886
who secretly admired Chip
more than even his own father."

09:13.970 --> 09:18.015
"Chip gazed at the sexy outline
of the murder victim on the floor.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.767
'What a waste of curves,' he growled.

09:19.850 --> 09:23.020
He checked his Rolex watch,
which was real.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.732
It was almost golf o'clock,
so the case would have to wait.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.569
Good thing he'd already solved it.

09:29.652 --> 09:33.030
-The killer was Luis, the valet."

09:33.114 --> 09:36.033
He solves the murder on page ten.
What is the rest of this book about?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.868
-How's it going, ladies?

09:38.452 --> 09:41.289
Oh, you know, just delving
into the great works of literature.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.083
Yeah, so, listen. Um...

09:44.166 --> 09:49.505
Maybe Brent made some insensitive choices,

09:49.589 --> 09:51.632
but could you possibly
see your way to forgiving him?

09:52.258 --> 09:53.551
-I suppose.
-No.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.094
No?

09:55.177 --> 09:57.054
Sorry, but no, I can't.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.558
This book is objectifying,
misogynistic and racist.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.852
Why are we still dealing
with this shirt in the Good Place?

10:02.935 --> 10:05.146
When people like him are ignorant jerks,

10:05.229 --> 10:07.607
why are people like us
asked to forgive him?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.859
Also, and this is less important,

10:09.942 --> 10:12.528
why is he in a fighter jet
for his author photo?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.740
Well, I can answer the last one.
It's because he loves <i>Top Gun.</i>

10:15.823 --> 10:18.451
-Oh.
-As for the other questions,

10:18.534 --> 10:21.621
I will get back to you, after I consult

10:21.704 --> 10:24.999
a number of immortal beings,
who are very wise.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.213
Didn't take you for a linksman.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.049
I appreciate golf.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.675
As Ben Hogan once said,

10:34.759 --> 10:37.470
"The most important shot in golf
is the next one."

10:37.553 --> 10:39.555
That's a lovely idea.

10:39.639 --> 10:44.018
If you make a mistake, you always have
a chance to redeem yourself.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.896
Yeah, well, as John Daly once said
to David Lee Roth

10:46.979 --> 10:50.149
at the 2002 Chili's Pro-Am in Orlando,

10:50.232 --> 10:52.443
"Suck on this drive, buttmunch!"

10:57.031 --> 10:58.658
Whoo!

10:58.741 --> 11:01.285
Nailed it.
That was a flusher but she sank.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.455
Perhaps an adept linksman
like yourself should play

11:04.538 --> 11:06.874
with the assistance filter turned off?

11:07.458 --> 11:10.503
-Let's play old-school.
-All right. Why not?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.050
Fork! You sneezed, man.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.761
I don't think I sneezed,
because I literally can't.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.679
Well, somebody sneezed. Damn it.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.057
Brent, buddy, nobody sneezed.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.727
-You hit a bad shot, and it's fine.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.939
You know, it isn't a sign of weakness
to admit that you screwed up.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.191
Fine, whatever, I shanked it.

11:32.274 --> 11:37.613
There ya go. Now let's go find your ball,
and try to do better on your next shot.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.657
And you know, if this ends up

11:39.740 --> 11:44.870
applying to any other aspect
of your life later on, then cool.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.832
-What?
-What? Nothing. Nothing.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.458
<i>I gotta say, Bad Janet,</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:52.586
I really felt like
I had managed to stop the bleeding.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.922
You thought that dingdong would do
a total personality 180

11:55.005 --> 11:56.882
because of one gentle metaphor?

11:56.966 --> 11:58.926
What can I say? I'm an optimist.

11:59.009 --> 12:03.389
But two days later, at the event,
it fell apart almost immediately.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.975
Hey, uh, thanks for not telling anyone
about Jason.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.728
Oh, well, ever since I arrived here,
Tahani helped me realize

12:09.812 --> 12:12.982
that gossip was an unhealthy way for me
to boost my self-esteem.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.485
But on the other hand,
this Jason tea needs to be spilled.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.237
Just try to remember
what Immanuel Kant said,

12:18.320 --> 12:20.865
"It is your duty
to keep your friend's secrets."

12:20.948 --> 12:23.617
But my favorite philosopher,
Bethenny Frankel, would say

12:23.701 --> 12:28.038
that I have a duty to "mention it all!"
And "if you can't handle the truth,

12:28.122 --> 12:29.915
then you can't handle me."

12:29.999 --> 12:31.333
-Once again, I beg you, please listen

12:31.417 --> 12:34.587
to Immanuel Kant and not Bethenny Frankel.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.047
Gah! Well, I gotta goss about something.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.132
What about a few blind items

12:38.215 --> 12:39.758
-that I picked up around the neighborhood?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.719
You wanna know who wears
the same dumb shorts every day?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.929
-No, I don't.
-It's "Dumb Shorts Cathy."

12:44.680 --> 12:45.514
Simone?

12:46.390 --> 12:50.603
Uh, I have been thinking about those
very good questions that you asked me.

12:50.686 --> 12:51.812
I'm sorry for the delay.

12:51.896 --> 12:57.485
The ancient scrolls I had to consult
were very hard to... roll back up.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.946
Um, anyway, I thought about
what you should say to Brent

13:01.030 --> 13:02.823
when he asks
for your opinion of his novel.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.160
Me, too. I have a great idea.
I'm gonna tell him it sucks very hard.

13:06.243 --> 13:10.331
Well, listen. You're absolutely right
that Brent needs to evolve, but

13:10.414 --> 13:15.127
there may be a more subtle way
to make that happen.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.046
Hey, there they are.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.256
-Charlie's Angels.
- Oof.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.175
So, did you finish the book?
What'd you think?

13:21.258 --> 13:25.054
Well, very interesting word choices.

13:25.137 --> 13:29.558
I've definitely never seen the word
"pants-tent" used so many times.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.310
Yeah. I kinda just felt like,
in that moment,

13:31.393 --> 13:33.479
that that's what the surgeon general
would say.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.564
What else? Let's hear some more complos.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.567
Compliments. For when you introduce me.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.820
Just writing a book
is an amazing accomplishment.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.114
You bet your butt it is.
The story's incredible, too.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.910
I mean, Chip solves the mystery
on page ten. Greatest detective ever.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.453
So, hop on up there,

13:49.537 --> 13:51.872
and just speak from the heart
about how it's your favorite book ever.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.710
Actually, I have to say, um,

13:56.794 --> 14:00.339
the Scarlett Pakistan character
is clearly based on Tahani,

14:00.422 --> 14:02.132
and it's not exactly flattering.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.009
Not flattering?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.053
I said she's got huge ones.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.556
-Ultimate complo.
-Yeah, see, there...

14:08.639 --> 14:11.183
Brent, remember our conversation
about making mistakes

14:11.267 --> 14:14.144
and how the most important shot
is the next one?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.772
Hang on a second. You guys agree with her?

14:17.398 --> 14:18.399
Unreal.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.525
I didn't ask to get yelled at

14:19.608 --> 14:21.610
-by the PC police. You know...

14:21.694 --> 14:22.861
...I was gonna give you
10% off the cover price.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.573
But now you're gonna have to pay
the full 65 bucks like everybody else.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.157
There's no money here.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.118
Book event is canceled.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.953
Because of these mean women.

14:32.079 --> 14:32.955
Oh, man.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.877
Perhaps I can convince Simone
to handle this the British way:

14:37.960 --> 14:42.006
smile bravely, bury your feelings
and allow a steady drizzle

14:42.089 --> 14:44.508
to slowly wash away your sadness
over 50 years.

14:45.134 --> 14:49.013
F that. Simone is not the problem.
Brent is.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.098
He needs to change,

14:51.181 --> 14:53.851
and walking on eggshells around him
ain't gonna do the trick.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.729
We need to throw the egg
right at his face.

14:56.812 --> 15:01.400
You're right. Enough is enough.
He lived on Earth for almost 60 years.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.278
This experiment is more than halfway over.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.363
He's got to improve,
and we can't wait forever.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.407
Janet, where is he now?

15:08.490 --> 15:09.950
Take a wild guess.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.579
Hey, bud. Whatcha up to?

15:13.662 --> 15:16.123
-Grippin' and rippin'?
-Trying to.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.000
Just seems like the big dog
don't wanna hunt today.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.878
You know, Simone was very mean to me.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.172
Maybe even a little racist.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.799
Well, listen. Art is subjective.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.553
More importantly...

15:29.637 --> 15:32.097
No other way to put this, buddy.
You made a mistake.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.974
Your actions hurt people,

15:34.058 --> 15:36.393
and you have to take responsibility
for that.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.272
You need to come back and apologize.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.651
Take the first step
toward healing the neighborhood.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.695
Fine. I'll be the bigger man.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.072
Just like my dad,

15:48.155 --> 15:50.491
when he single-handedly took on
all those class-action lawsuits.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.285
-I just wish I could

15:53.369 --> 15:54.203
get through to the guy.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.914
I wonder if he'd respond
to some social contract theory.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.374
Why are you trying to help him?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.042
He doesn't even know you exist.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.710
He doesn't see other people.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.965
I mean, he did call me "a four-eyed coward
who probably dry-humps books."

16:06.048 --> 16:07.383
-But why not be a bigger person

16:07.466 --> 16:08.300
and rise above it?

16:08.384 --> 16:09.927
I'll tell you why. Because doing that

16:10.010 --> 16:12.304
sends a message
that it's okay to be treated this way,

16:12.388 --> 16:13.222
and it's not okay

16:13.305 --> 16:14.682
-to treat anyone that way.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.685
Not Tahani. Not me. Not even you, Igby.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.479
-Everyone? Gather round, please.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.023
Brent has something that he'd like to say.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.444
Okay.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.322
Regarding my critically acclaimed novel,

16:30.906 --> 16:32.741
I am very sorry

16:32.825 --> 16:35.661
if you were offended. Okay?

16:36.578 --> 16:37.538
Not an apology.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.039
Yes, it was.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.332
Okay, fine.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.044
I'm sorry if what I wrote,
which was perfectly okay,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.422
somehow made you feel like it wasn't okay.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.048
But you know what, that's on you.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.134
Brent, wrong direction, bud.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.679
No, sorry, man, either apologize for real
or stop wasting our time.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.640
Okay, you know what? I'm actually
not sorry at all. How about that?

16:56.724 --> 16:57.683
Is that what you want to hear?

16:57.766 --> 16:59.685
Very obviously not.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.562
Why don't we take a break?
Let's all get a snack.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.732
Not until they give me
the complos I rightly deserve.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.109
You want a complo?
I'll give you a complo.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.988
I didn't think it was possible
to write a book as awful as yours.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.657
I literally didn't think
human beings were capable

17:13.741 --> 17:16.827
of such racist, sexist poppycock.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.622
Also, Chip Driver is either a private eye,

17:20.706 --> 17:23.167
or the quarterback for the Chicago Bears,

17:23.250 --> 17:25.461
or "the world's strongest president."

17:25.544 --> 17:26.712
He cannot be all three.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.632
Oh, boy.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.593
This is a disgrace.

17:33.093 --> 17:36.388
I accomplished something. I wrote a novel.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.223
And now my integrity is being attacked?

17:38.307 --> 17:39.475
I have been called racist, sexist.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.977
I don't have a racist or sexist bone
in my body.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.063
I am Brent Norwalk, and I'm a good person.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.564
I'm in the Good Place.
You ever heard of it?

17:45.647 --> 17:47.649
And I'm here because I deserve to be here.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.319
I'm here because I earned it,
by being the best.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.737
Ugh, you're ridiculous.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.155
Yeah and you're a condescending bench.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.201
Uh, don't talk to her that way, please.
Hey, I have an idea.

17:57.284 --> 18:00.245
Let me summon
a few philosophical works we can use--

18:00.329 --> 18:02.623
Ugh! Enough with the frickin' books, Igby.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.791
You probably don't even know this,

18:03.874 --> 18:05.000
but that character is based on you.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.835
No, I knew it, man. Oh!

18:06.919 --> 18:09.046
-Look out!
-Ah! I'm being attacked again.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.672
-Sorry, that was unintentional.
-Fork you.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.430
So, I'm thinking bagel bites...

18:19.223 --> 18:20.808
-for the snack?

18:21.892 --> 18:23.018
Ah.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.938
Middle-aged American male fragility.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.815
You know why they're called
baby boomers, right?

18:27.898 --> 18:31.151
Because the tiniest little pinprick
to their ego and boom!

18:31.235 --> 18:33.028
They become babies.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.405
I mean, that was it. We were forked.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.242
Six months of painstaking work,

18:38.325 --> 18:43.705
trying to help the four humans overcome
their worst instincts and bond as a group.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.875
And in a poof, it was gone.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.336
I told you, man. Humans suck.

18:51.171 --> 18:55.592
Well, this story has one more chapter.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.307
So, today was bad.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.145
Today was very bad.
Everyone for sure lost a bunch of points.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.274
And I don't have a solution.

19:12.734 --> 19:16.738
Okay. Well, let's reset.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.782
I'll do something mildly iffy,

19:18.866 --> 19:22.494
and let John make a small,
good decision to help.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.455
I could tell him
I'm going to get ombre highlights,

19:25.539 --> 19:26.665
and let him talk me out of it.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.500
What's wrong with ombre highlights?

19:28.584 --> 19:31.795
Eleanor. Please.
This week has been hard enough.

19:33.130 --> 19:37.342
I could set my robes on fire
and try and get Brent to put it out.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.637
I know you're only suggesting that
because you've repeatedly said

19:40.721 --> 19:42.764
you would look "dope"
in flaming monk robes,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.308
but that's actually not a bad idea.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.936
Force him to help someone
without actually thinking about it.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.147
Then maybe I'll ask Chidi to lead
a class on empathy.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.316
Yes! Okay, let's write these down.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.734
We got plenty of time left.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.110
We can get back on track.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.696
- <i>That was an hour ago.</i>

19:57.779 --> 20:02.117
<i>Right before I came here</i>
<i>to see you for the last time.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:06.663
For months, you and I have been debating,
are people good or bad?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.498
But as I watched those three people

20:08.582 --> 20:10.918
pick themselves up
and dust themselves off,

20:11.001 --> 20:13.712
I realized we've been asking
the wrong question.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.840
What matters
isn't if people are good or bad.

20:16.924 --> 20:22.930
What matters is if they're trying to be
better today than they were yesterday.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.265
You ask me where my hope comes from?

20:25.849 --> 20:27.184
That's your answer.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.146
What are you doing?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.481
Sending you home.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.525
I'm not marbleizing you, Janet.
I'm letting you go.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.028
I've tried to win you over to our side.

20:38.111 --> 20:42.157
It hasn't worked, so keeping you
as a prisoner just seems cruel.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.410
Letting you go home is how I've decided

20:45.494 --> 20:49.998
to be a little better today
than I was yesterday.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.126
Here's your phone...

20:54.169 --> 20:56.505
and a, uh, parting gift.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.465
Oh. Sweet. Is that Brent's book?

20:58.548 --> 21:02.219
No. I didn't have any cash on me,
so I couldn't get you a copy.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.179
This is a manifesto,

21:04.263 --> 21:06.848
detailing everything
that's happened with the humans.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.434
-Janet and I wrote it a while back.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.353
She's been updating it as we go.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.022
-I hope you'll read it.
-Great thinking.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.526
People that get books as gifts
always read them.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.945
Bye!
