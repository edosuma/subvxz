01:09.736 --> 01:11.696
WOMAN:
Hey, baby.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.239
-You ready?
-Where were you?

01:14.324 --> 01:16.618
-What?
-Where were you?

01:16.701 --> 01:21.289
I'm sorry, hon. I got held up down at the Clover.
Guess I kind of lost track of time.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.999
You were drinking?

01:23.083 --> 01:26.503
Kimmy. It was one beer.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.589
-Doesn't smell like one beer.
-Well, that's what it was.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.967
So let's go. Get in.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.887
<i>♪ It's an affair of the heart ♪♪</i>

01:35.970 --> 01:39.057
Kim, I'm not doing this. Come on. It's cold out.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.268
Let's go get some food, go home.

01:42.352 --> 01:46.272
Split a box of McNuggets, see what's on TV.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.819
I'm just gonna walk.

01:50.902 --> 01:55.281
Really? You're gonna walk three miles
with a cello.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.159
Don't be stupid. Get in.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.664
I'll let you choose the radio station. Come on.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.926
Kim, get in the car right now.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.055
I said it was one beer.
You're gonna be like this?

02:22.517 --> 02:23.852
You don't believe me?

02:25.854 --> 02:28.231
Kim, get in, or I'm driving home.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.275
Right now, in the car.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.155
I mean it. I'm going.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.368
Fine. Don't listen to me.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.372
You never listen!

03:33.212 --> 03:34.547
DONALD:
<i>Freedom.</i>

03:34.631 --> 03:36.633
<i>Freedom to ride.</i>

03:36.716 --> 03:39.761
<i>Freedom to explore.</i>

03:39.844 --> 03:41.679
<i>Freedom to bank...</i>

03:42.680 --> 03:44.057
<i>the way you want to.</i>

03:45.058 --> 03:50.271
<i>Hi, I'm Don Wachtell,</i>
<i>president of Mesa Verde.</i>

03:50.355 --> 03:54.025
<i>For the past 10 years,</i>
<i>our family has taken pride</i>

03:54.108 --> 03:58.655
<i>in helping your family grow your savings</i>
<i>out here in the Southwest,</i>

03:58.738 --> 04:00.949
<i>with freedom from hidden fees,</i>

04:01.032 --> 04:04.744
<i>and freedom to choose the account</i>
<i>that's right for you.</i>

04:04.827 --> 04:07.705
<i>-Ain't that right, Kevin?</i>
<i>-That's right, Dad.</i>

04:09.499 --> 04:10.333
<i>Yup!</i>

04:11.334 --> 04:15.713
<i>Let our family help find your freedom</i>
<i>at Mesa Verde.</i>

04:28.142 --> 04:30.353
SAUL:
So can you do it?

04:30.436 --> 04:33.815
The media lab has a Vision Mixer.
I think we can get the effect you're going for.

04:33.898 --> 04:37.902
And with makeup and costumes,
we can make it look like the same time period.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.070
That's great.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.571
I love it.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.407
It's gonna sing.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.370
I'm sensing that Schleprock here
is gonna puke on my parade.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.454
You want it when?

04:48.538 --> 04:52.875
Uh, as soon as possible.
Tomorrow would be optimal.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.462
Let me break it down for you, chief.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.341
You got 10 spots. I count 12, 13 locations.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.470
And then there's post, graphics,
this video-effects thing you're talking.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.682
That's a week, maybe more.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.519
Probably more. We have midterms.

05:11.602 --> 05:16.733
And plus, we have to lug all our stuff around.
And actors, craft service...

05:16.816 --> 05:18.985
You scout these locations?
I got a place to plug in?

05:19.068 --> 05:21.821
Oh, and bathrooms. People need bathrooms.
They literally--

05:21.904 --> 05:23.489
Whoa. Whoa, just...

05:23.573 --> 05:26.159
There's gotta be a way, right?
Because we're smart.

05:26.242 --> 05:29.287
So we can figure out a way, right?

05:31.039 --> 05:32.790
-Cut the number of spots.
SAUL: No.

05:32.874 --> 05:38.421
It's-- Shock and awe is what I'm going for here.
Anything less, no.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.340
What if you use voiceovers instead of actors?

05:41.424 --> 05:43.134
Or if we did in all in one location.

05:43.217 --> 05:47.263
So no actors, no scope, no impact. No. Just...

05:48.598 --> 05:51.225
I just feel like
if we just get out there and this...

05:51.309 --> 05:53.853
We hustle. We can do it. We can.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.938
Dude, can't be done.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.445
SAUL: We can...
-Dude, we can't.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.201
I don't know. What if we did the Superman thing?

06:09.952 --> 06:11.996
Uh, a what?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.707
You know, like Superman. Like, um...

06:14.791 --> 06:18.419
Well, like a weatherman. Blue screen, I think.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.214
Do you mean a green screen?

06:21.297 --> 06:24.217
Whatever. Blue, green, just...

06:24.300 --> 06:25.968
Can we do that?

06:26.886 --> 06:28.054
You got a green screen?

06:36.270 --> 06:38.272
Looking good, gentlemen.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.775
-Red leather, yellow leather.
-What?

06:40.858 --> 06:44.529
-Red leather, yellow leather.
-Very nice.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.870
Mah. Mah.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.622
Mom makes meat.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.083
-Mom makes meat.
-Red leather, yellow leather.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.795
Red leather, red-- Yellow. Yellow leather.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.839
We're ready ready.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.467
Oh. Ahem. Everyone, a lot to do, no time to do it.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.846
-Who knows their lines?
-Yes, I believe I have it.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.472
Ah. I love a man of confidence.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.768
I played Prospero on the plaza
a month after prostate surgery.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.105
-One has to have confidence.
-Wonderful. God bless.

07:19.188 --> 07:22.400
Now bring that confidence
right over here to this mark on the floor.

07:22.483 --> 07:27.029
That's your spot. Do not move from it. Okay?

07:27.113 --> 07:30.241
But also, don't be rigid, okay? Try to be natural.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.452
And speak to me.

07:32.535 --> 07:37.290
You know, conversational,
everyday, like a friend. But... Ugh. Ahem.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.418
There's fear here, there's emotion.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.129
You're searching for a hero, you know?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.756
Will no one save you?

07:45.840 --> 07:50.595
But don't hit it too hard.
Just throw it away, but with feeling.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.971
Okay? Good. How we doing?

07:52.054 --> 07:53.598
-Let's shoot this mother.
-All right.

07:53.681 --> 07:57.226
Oh. Ahem. There's cue cards if you need them.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.687
But don't look at them, look at me, okay?

07:59.770 --> 08:03.232
-But you know, they're there. So roll sound.
SOUND GUY: Rolling.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.358
-Camera?
-Speed.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.069
And action.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.864
This is great. Stand right there. You look great.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.282
Eyes open.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.953
Yeah, good. Good. Can I drop your jaw?
Sideways, a little?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.914
-Perfect. That's it. Press record.
-I can't--

08:17.997 --> 08:21.501
-And five, four, three, two, magic.
-Magic.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.836
-Delicious.
-Can't have pizza while we do the thing.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.839
We're trying to shoot the commercial, that's why.
I'll keep it here.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.676
Look up this way. Right?
And then stay right like that.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.678
All right. Show it to me. Boom.

08:32.762 --> 08:37.308
You're a cool guy, okay? But not too cool.
I need you to be relatable.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.644
Give me that "Fonz." All right. Good.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.938
Put it down. Nobody's buying it.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.774
Okay. The cane, I think, is a little too much.
Can I have it?

08:44.857 --> 08:48.611
And five, four, three, two, magic.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.572
-What?
-Leave it. Let go. Just really... Okay?

08:53.908 --> 08:57.036
You look very, very officious, okay?

08:57.119 --> 09:00.122
All right. Can you smile warmly? No?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.207
I'm trying to direct.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.543
-Good. Get out of the way. Out of the way.
-Okay.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.837
And acting.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.839
Cool. All right. Do that. Ready? Yeah.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.466
Yeah, like this.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.802
Too much... Put your hand right... Yeah, yeah.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.931
Stand on the X. This is great.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.099
Smile.

09:18.182 --> 09:22.395
Turn sideways. Take your coke out of her hand.

09:22.478 --> 09:25.231
And now, look sad. Glum.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.694
And then when I say, "action," you look here.
No, faster.

09:29.777 --> 09:33.573
Make it a whip. Whip your head.
Up here and then go. Action.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.783
Look back. Okay. Anyone else?

09:35.866 --> 09:39.704
So that they don't reflect, okay?
That looks normal. Look right in.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.665
Look at me. Point.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.500
No. Like this.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.462
More. More.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.174
Good. Make it look real.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.928
And cut.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.222
Beautiful.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.667
I'm Saul Goodman. If you...

10:42.892 --> 10:45.019
Just hold on. Hold on.

10:46.270 --> 10:49.482
You came. I'm sorry, you missed most of it.
I'm almost through my part.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.860
Now, you coming in? Because, hey,
we still got a slice or two of pizza left.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.403
No. I ate at the office. I'm good.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.157
Are you sure? Because it's cold pizza
fondled by community theater actors.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.992
You're gonna pass on that?

11:00.076 --> 11:03.454
Yeah, I think I will pass. I just wanted to talk.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.706
Talk? Yeah, sure.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.584
Of course. Five.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.756
Um, good news. I tracked down Olivia Bitsui.
She is 92 years young.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.009
She's part of the Navajo Nation.
She lives out by Window Rock.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.471
I'm gonna call her first thing in the morning.
Hopefully have a face-to-face.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.556
-Jimmy...
-I'm gonna bring a floral arrangement,

11:22.640 --> 11:25.184
or maybe a cake assortment
from Brother's Bakery?

11:25.267 --> 11:28.646
-Good idea...
-Jimmy. Do you think...?

11:30.189 --> 11:34.193
Will Acker settle for 75,000?

11:34.276 --> 11:37.446
-Seventy-five?
-Yeah. Will he go for it?

11:38.447 --> 11:42.159
Are you saying that Kevin is willing
to go up to 75 on this?

11:42.243 --> 11:43.202
I...

11:43.285 --> 11:48.290
Look, we'll negotiate as far up as we can,
and then I'll make up the difference.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.084
Okay, hold on.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.671
You'll make up the difference, as in,
out-of-your-own-pocket make up the difference?

11:53.754 --> 11:54.713
I-- Yes.

11:54.797 --> 11:58.217
I just need to end this now and move on.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.470
But why? No. Hey, we have him.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.681
Rich is suspicious.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.225
He said some things.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.644
He's second-guessing
how you got to be Acker's lawyer

12:08.727 --> 12:10.563
and questioning my intentions.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.022
Enough to want me off the case.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.650
We move forward with this,
Rich figures out what's happening.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.278
Here's the truth. Rich knows nothing.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.071
-Well, not yet. No.
-Not ever.

12:19.155 --> 12:24.034
He has nothing.
There is no way to prove anything.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.582
You may be right.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.421
But it's just not worth it.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.300
But what about the play here?

12:39.383 --> 12:42.094
The play is beautiful.

12:43.220 --> 12:49.310
God, this is like watching a walk-off home run
just drift foul.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.402
It's your play. If you wanna walk, we'll walk.

13:02.656 --> 13:06.035
So I gotta break it to the kids.

13:08.245 --> 13:12.416
Well, there's a lot to clean up
before Mrs. Nguyen can open in the morning, so...

13:12.500 --> 13:15.211
-I'll help.
-No. You've been all day at work.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.380
Jimmy, you're out here doing all this
because of me. I'm helping.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.965
Yeah.

13:20.966 --> 13:25.679
All right. Just don't touch the camera.
He claims it's an extension of his body.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.349
KIM:
Noted.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.915
NACHO:
You're Michael?

14:35.958 --> 14:39.336
The gringo Lalo had a bug up his ass about?

14:40.337 --> 14:44.842
-If Hector or the cousins ever find out about...
-They're not gonna find out.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.928
Get on with it.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.183
Lalo's using his C.I. connection.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.812
He's having Domingo call the DEA
to rat out your dealers.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.149
Times they're slinging, locations.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.694
Your guys are gonna get swept up.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.283
Promote low-level dealers.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.244
Or find new ones.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.121
Let them get arrested.

15:15.122 --> 15:18.042
Protect our people.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.377
-You got it.
-What else?

15:20.461 --> 15:23.339
He talks about a lot of things.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.840
Um...

15:25.841 --> 15:29.345
Hitting your supply trucks,
going after your restaurants.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.305
Getting your customers sick.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.933
Cutting off power, busting open pipes.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.601
He's gonna chip away at your business

15:35.684 --> 15:39.229
until the bosses down south don't think
you're worth the trouble.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.074
From now on, you report to this man.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.996
He needs you, you do not hesitate.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.333
Act.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.401
Guessing there's something
you wanna get off your chest.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.243
You know who you're working for, right?

16:36.870 --> 16:40.332
The shit that this guy does.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.044
They shot me.

16:44.128 --> 16:48.048
Left me bleeding out in the desert,
all part of some plan.

16:49.091 --> 16:53.012
I don't know what to tell you. I warned you.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.973
-What?
-I warned you,

16:56.056 --> 17:00.561
when you started going after Hector Salamanca,
there'd be others to worry about.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.979
You made a choice.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.441
You got in with both eyes open.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.444
My father didn't.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.866
He's got a gun to my father's head.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.788
I don't do what he says...

17:19.872 --> 17:23.625
Look, first things first.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.171
We take care of Lalo.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.342
Then we'll talk.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.190
KIM:
Paige, you've got Kim, Rich and Marcie.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.484
PAIGE:
<i>Guys, I hope you're calling with good news.</i>

17:48.567 --> 17:51.487
-You sitting down?
<i>-Oh, God. Really?</i>

17:51.570 --> 17:53.363
Yep. Acker's decided to settle.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.200
Tell Kevin he's got his call center.

17:56.283 --> 18:00.537
<i>Fantastic. Kevin will be over the moon.</i>
<i>When is it official?</i>

18:00.621 --> 18:03.957
There's a meeting on the books with Mr. Goodman
for Wednesday at 3:00.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.667
<i>Music to my ears.</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:08.504
<i>Kevin's gonna wanna be there</i>
<i>to close this out and celebrate.</i>

18:08.587 --> 18:09.505
I can't wait.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.716
-Congrats, Paige.
<i>-Congrats to you guys.</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:16.970
<i>Kim, this was another tough one,</i>
<i>but you did it again.</i>

18:17.054 --> 18:20.099
Uh, team effort. We'll e-mail you the details.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.226
<i>Great. Talk soon.</i>

18:24.186 --> 18:25.104
Okay.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.192
Well, now that that's behind us and I have you here,
I wanna talk to Jason in Charlotte,

18:30.275 --> 18:32.611
walk us through
these Fannie and Freddie changes.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.697
Dorothy, can you set up that North Carolina call?

18:35.781 --> 18:39.701
Actually, before we do that...
Sorry, Marcie, would you give us a minute?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.578
Sure. Absolutely.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.499
Dorothy, hold off on that call, please. Thanks.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.087
I, uh...

18:51.296 --> 18:53.048
I wanted to talk about yesterday.

18:54.007 --> 18:58.929
Rich, you've been nothing but generous to me,
and you don't deserve to be yelled at.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.597
It was unprofessional.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.809
I believe me staying on the case
was the right thing,

19:03.892 --> 19:06.770
but that was the wrong way to react.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.316
That's it.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.069
Just that I'm sorry.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.531
Hmm.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.867
Kim,

19:20.909 --> 19:23.662
you have a bone to pick with me, pick away.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.582
In fact, you wanna lose your shit,
that's all right too.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.334
I'm not perfect. I've broken plenty of times.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.546
But never in front of the troops.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.091
I don't have to spell out
what it does for morale, confidence.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.843
Never again.

19:42.806 --> 19:47.311
Hi. Yeah. No, let's punt the call to Charlotte
to another time.

19:47.394 --> 19:51.648
Also, cancel my 12:30,
but keep the reservation.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.776
Yeah, that's right. Thanks.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.239
You and me,

19:59.323 --> 20:01.408
we're going to lunch.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.994
And everyone is gonna see us.

20:04.995 --> 20:05.913
Good?

20:07.122 --> 20:10.834
-Good.
-All right, then. After you.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.255
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.173
Excuse me.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.677
-Are these really only a quarter each?
-That's right.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.513
Why so cheap?
Is there some kind of damage I'm not seeing?

21:04.596 --> 21:07.474
No. We get lots of donations,
books we already have,

21:07.557 --> 21:09.351
and there's not enough room
on the shelves,

21:09.434 --> 21:12.145
so we sell what we can, to pay for newer releases.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.607
Wow, I mean, you're kidding me.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.484
<i>Treasure Island.</i>

21:17.567 --> 21:18.568
Huh.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.821
Yeah.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.907
And <i>The Little Prince.</i>

21:23.991 --> 21:27.369
Hmm. My granddaughter's gonna love these.

21:27.452 --> 21:32.749
All right. Well, I will start with eight.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.545
-All right. Eight. That's $2.
-Yes, ma'am.

21:41.758 --> 21:45.095
-Thank you. Do you need a bag?
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.763
And may I ask...

21:47.806 --> 21:52.019
-Is there a Lillian Simmons working here?
-Yes, I'm Lily.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.521
Lily. Great.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.356
My name's Dave Clark.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.984
I'm a private investigator.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.071
-Oh. Is this about Travel Wire?
-That's right.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.741
I already told the police everything I saw,
which wasn't much.

22:05.824 --> 22:09.453
You saw a man with a mustache,
dark hair, kind of tall.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.954
I'm not even sure anymore.

22:11.038 --> 22:14.708
It was through two sets of glass,
and he was leaning over a desk.

22:14.791 --> 22:20.380
Are you free to sit and talk somewhere?
See if you remember any other details?

22:20.464 --> 22:24.009
As I said, I told the police
everything I could remember.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.260
Oh, I know.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.763
And the police are doing their best
with that information.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.974
But I've been hired by the family.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.228
And I am trying to help them find...

22:36.188 --> 22:37.522
Hmm.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.150
They're looking for closure, Lily.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.986
Anything to bring them peace.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.825
I send money back to my parents back in Taiwan.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.660
I do it every month.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.579
Fred was always there.

22:52.662 --> 22:55.457
We didn't really talk much. But he was efficient.

22:55.540 --> 22:59.211
So you see that man inside
on the day in question?

22:59.294 --> 23:04.091
That's right. The door sign was flipped "closed,"
which it never was,

23:04.174 --> 23:07.552
and then the man pointed at the sign
and waved me off.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.639
I don't know, I thought they were having
Internet problems or something.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.100
I came back 20 minutes later...

23:13.183 --> 23:17.145
Oh, it was horrible.
Thick black smoke and flames.

23:17.229 --> 23:21.566
And the man with the mustache,
you didn't see him when you returned?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.903
No. I got there
just as the fire engines were arriving.

23:24.986 --> 23:28.615
Well, let's talk about when you first got there.
You drove, I assume.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.742
-Yes.
-Where'd you park?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.662
Right out front, just to the right of the entrance.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.666
-Were there any other cars parked there?
-Um, a few.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.917
-The normal amount.
-Mm-hm.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.505
-Any unusual or unique cars?
-Unusual?

23:43.588 --> 23:47.467
Older cars, classic cars.
Something you might not see every day.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.598
Actually, I think there was.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.767
Do you remember what kind?

23:56.768 --> 23:59.020
Oh, I don't really know cars.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.773
-It had four wheels.
-Ha-ha-ha.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.359
Okay.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.156
That look familiar?

24:21.459 --> 24:24.588
-Is this the car?
-Um...

24:24.671 --> 24:27.549
That's not for me to say.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.771
Um...

24:41.855 --> 24:43.857
Yes. Now that I look at it...

24:43.940 --> 24:46.568
-Yes. That was the type of car it was.
-Uh-huh.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.821
A customized 1970 Monte Carlo?

24:49.905 --> 24:51.573
Okay.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.285
And that is a huge help, Lily.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.579
Thank you very much.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.123
Oh, good. Anything for that poor family.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.834
-Uh, there is something else.
-Yes?

25:02.918 --> 25:06.171
If you were able to call the detectives
who interviewed you

25:06.254 --> 25:11.384
and pass this along firsthand,
tell them that you remember that detail.

25:12.344 --> 25:16.640
That was so long ago.
I don't think I can remember who I spoke to.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.893
Well, I have that right here.

25:22.229 --> 25:27.734
Detective Tim Roberts. That's his number.
Probably catch him at his desk right now.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.906
Oh, okay.

25:32.989 --> 25:38.078
A gray 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.371
-Gray?
-Mm-hm.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.957
And if you don't mind, don't mention my name.

25:42.040 --> 25:46.878
Police get a little funny about private investigators
horning in on their business.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.755
They can have all the credit.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.633
I only want justice.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.887
Oh. Absolutely. I understand.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.391
Thank you, Lily.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.609
Count your lucky stars
we got Judge Papadoumian.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.694
She likes my flair.

26:10.777 --> 26:14.281
Baby, you went the extra mile for us today.
Don't think I didn't notice.

26:14.364 --> 26:17.951
Hey, you want a quick rub-n-tug,
just to say thanks?

26:18.952 --> 26:22.706
We won't mess up your suit or nothing.
We'll clean you up nice with a warm towel.

26:22.789 --> 26:28.586
A warm towel? I appreciate the offer,
but I'm gonna politely decline, if that's okay.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.629
Raincheck.

26:29.713 --> 26:33.300
Well, we gotta get back to it, anyway.
Almost lunchtime.

26:33.383 --> 26:38.930
Oh, hey, do you two take, maybe...
Maybe you should take a break.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.851
You don't see restaurants closing doors at noon,
do you? Lunch is peak traffic.

26:42.934 --> 26:47.147
Just be careful, all right?
And try not to get picked up again. Okay?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.565
Yeah.

27:01.494 --> 27:04.622
Ladies, hey! Ahem. Ladies. Heh-heh.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.374
Uh...

27:06.458 --> 27:11.129
Hey, how much for an hour of your time?

27:17.052 --> 27:18.678
Excuse me. Judge Greene?

27:18.762 --> 27:23.058
-I keep hearing the news. A hole-in-one at Sandia?
-I don't wanna say it was all luck.

27:23.141 --> 27:26.811
Then don't say another word.
U.S. Open, here we come.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.859
-Cliff. Been waiting long?
-Not at all. You're right on time.

27:32.942 --> 27:34.944
Uh, thank you, Francisco.

27:35.028 --> 27:40.158
Saw you shaking hands with Judge Greene.
I don't know if you heard about his retiring.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.618
No. Retiring?

27:41.701 --> 27:45.121
Yup. Retiring with his 22-year-old law clerk.

27:45.205 --> 27:48.416
Really? Wow.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.754
Guess she's been filing a different type of brief
for the judge now, hasn't she?

27:52.837 --> 27:56.174
Very good.
Let's hear more about that hole-in-one.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.886
Gentlemen.
Can I round up some drinks for the table?

27:59.969 --> 28:03.014
Absolutely. More time with the menu,
or you ready to pull the trigger?

28:03.098 --> 28:04.808
Let's do it.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.778
I hear S&C are following the playbook.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.739
Erin and the gang already had a jump
on redrafting the complaint,

28:19.823 --> 28:22.075
then another box of receipts
were suddenly discovered.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.577
What are you hearing from Kiley?

28:26.663 --> 28:28.206
Uh...

28:28.289 --> 28:30.041
Can I help you?

28:30.125 --> 28:32.961
Howie. You know.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.965
I, uh... No. I don't know.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.843
-Oh, don't try to play us like that, Howie.
-Mm-mm.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.513
This is... I don't know them.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.141
Ladies, I don't know you.
This is some sort of mistake, so...

28:46.224 --> 28:50.145
Yeah, we made a mistake, all right.
Joe Dog ain't happy.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.604
You owe us.

28:51.688 --> 28:54.274
-Owe you?
-Yeah. Owe. Mm-hm.

28:54.357 --> 28:58.611
You can't take a ride on the Carnival Cruise and
only pay for a tugboat, you know what I'm saying?

28:58.695 --> 29:01.865
-I can leave, if you need...
-No, no. Ahem.

29:01.948 --> 29:07.120
Look, I don't know any Joe Dog or tugboat.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.580
So we can end this right now.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.207
We ain't leaving
without our cash money, honey.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.167
Mm-mm.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.211
I don't know you and owe no money to you.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.504
-That's it.
-Don't touch her!

29:16.588 --> 29:17.422
-I didn't--
-Aah!

29:18.423 --> 29:22.719
JIMMY: No, Cliff, these are not my hookers.
They're somebody else's.

29:22.802 --> 29:26.473
Howard, are you sure they're not your hookers?
They seem to be.

29:26.556 --> 29:31.603
No, no, Cliff. My hookers were taller than these.
Heh-heh.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.356
Oh, God, I'm good.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.093
Hello. Uh, Olivia Bitsui?

30:05.094 --> 30:08.014
Yes. Good afternoon, ma'am.
My name is Saul Goodman.

30:08.097 --> 30:11.851
I'm an attorney
based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.521
Yes. Yes, I'm a lawyer.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.733
Well, I wanted to ask you, um,

30:18.817 --> 30:23.363
have you ever heard
of a bank called Mesa Verde?

30:45.468 --> 30:47.011
MIKE:
You.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.557
What's that?

30:51.558 --> 30:52.600
Sorry?

30:53.726 --> 30:57.397
That. How long has it been down there?

31:00.692 --> 31:03.278
Uh, I don't know.

31:03.361 --> 31:07.323
It's an interoffice envelope. Isn't there a date?

31:07.407 --> 31:09.367
Uh, yes. Today.

31:09.450 --> 31:13.329
Today. And where is it supposed to be today?

31:14.873 --> 31:15.957
Detective Roberts.

31:16.040 --> 31:20.336
And don't you think
that Detective Roberts should get it

31:20.420 --> 31:22.797
sometime today?

31:23.923 --> 31:26.801
Yes. Absolutely. Sorry, sir.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.388
Hmm.

31:33.141 --> 31:39.647
If the smell is coming from under your porch,
it is most likely a possum.

31:40.648 --> 31:43.610
That's right. A possum.

31:45.111 --> 31:48.531
If it's a human body, yes, I'll investigate.

31:49.532 --> 31:52.577
But you need to call animal control first.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.247
Yes, I'm sure.

31:58.625 --> 32:04.130
You can also shine a flashlight under the porch
and see what's under there yourself.

32:04.213 --> 32:05.715
Well...

32:06.716 --> 32:12.847
if the porch isn't big enough for you to get under,
then there's probably not a dead body. Okay?

32:13.848 --> 32:17.560
Yes, sir. You have a good day.

32:24.275 --> 32:28.363
Ed. You need to put eyes on this.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.201
Hit-and-run.

32:33.284 --> 32:36.204
Same day as our Travel Wire murder.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.247
Check out the make of the car.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.000
1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

32:41.084 --> 32:44.712
Same model our librarian just called in.
What are the odds?

32:44.796 --> 32:48.383
Who sent this? Officer McFloss?
I can't even read that.

32:50.843 --> 32:54.889
The guy rammed his car
right through a parking gate? Wow.

32:54.973 --> 33:00.269
So we got a Monte Carlo at a lot here,
half hour before the murder.

33:00.353 --> 33:04.649
Leaves the scene of the hit-and-run,
headed east towards Travel Wire.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.359
Twenty blocks.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.821
This is sounding like our guy.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.493
James usually run late?

33:15.576 --> 33:17.286
He'll be here.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.083
All I care about is getting this behind us.

33:22.166 --> 33:25.169
Done. Finito.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.923
We won't have finalized contracts today,
but we'll definitely land on an agreement.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.642
Hello, folks.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.895
Nice to see lots and lots of happy faces,

33:42.979 --> 33:46.065
and you too, Rich. Kidding.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.151
-Jimmy. Always a pleasure.
-Saul.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.862
Saul Goodman during business hours,
s'all the time.

33:50.945 --> 33:53.448
This is Paige Novick,
Mesa Verde's in-house counsel.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.407
Nice to meet you.

33:54.490 --> 33:57.660
Paige. I know you're the one
who brought Kim Wexler onto the team,

33:57.744 --> 33:59.871
so I consider you the brains of the operation.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.456
I actually think you're right.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.042
And this is Kevin Wachtell, CEO of Mesa Verde.

34:04.125 --> 34:09.589
Oh, you know what?
I could tell from the impressive belt buckle.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.215
Looking forward to settling this.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.009
Me too. Let's do this.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.972
Ahem. Hey, Viola. How's it hanging?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.308
-I, uh... Good.
-Cool.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.311
-Just to jump into it--
-Jump away.

34:24.937 --> 34:29.317
As discussed, considering we're only
contractually obligated to pay 5000

34:29.400 --> 34:31.819
on top of fair market value for Mr. Acker's home,

34:31.903 --> 34:34.906
we believe 45,000 is more than generous.

34:34.989 --> 34:40.203
I hear that, but you and I have a different definition
of the word "generous."

34:40.286 --> 34:42.371
Because that's not how I would describe it.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.540
And here we go.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.502
We're not prepared to offer more
than what's on the table.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.005
No, no, I knew there would be dickering,
so let's just...

34:51.089 --> 34:55.051
Let's just hear the number you're looking for,
so we can all move forward with our lives.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.844
We'd like nothing more.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.348
What amount are you asking?

35:00.431 --> 35:02.058
Four million dollars.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.937
Four million. Very funny. Very funny.

35:06.020 --> 35:11.150
Mr. Acker would like to be paid 4 million dollars
for his pain and suffering.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.861
-It's what's fair.
-What in the world are you talking about?

35:13.945 --> 35:18.407
Well, it's a four with six zeroes,
and it's preceded by a dollar sign.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.828
-We had an agreement.
-We had a discussion.

35:21.911 --> 35:26.332
We had a verbal agreement on a number
that both sides would be happy with.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.876
And I discussed the offer with my client,

35:28.960 --> 35:33.506
and he really, really doesn't wanna leave
his house, his home.

35:33.589 --> 35:37.593
Four million is the only number
he'll be happy with.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.015
I apologize.

35:43.099 --> 35:48.271
We need to end this meeting now so Rich and I
can have a conversation with Mr. Goodman.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.191
Just incredible nerve.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.860
Ridiculous.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.821
What's your endgame here?
You know you'll never get that money.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.448
-Wait, don't leave.
-You're not wasting more of their time.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.200
SAUL: No...
-Kevin, meeting's over.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.244
Not while the gang's all here.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.955
I would love to bring up
a completely unrelated matter.

36:06.038 --> 36:09.125
KIM: Kevin, we can handle this.
-No, this is really good.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.962
You're gonna wanna see this.
Kevin, stick around. Your dad's in this.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.130
What?

36:14.213 --> 36:16.799
Kevin, I insist. This is a waste of your time.

36:16.883 --> 36:20.761
-There's only one way to find out.
-Kevin, I'm advising you to please keep walking.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.810
No. I wanna see this.

36:30.396 --> 36:33.149
SAUL:
Viola, you mind getting the shades?

36:34.400 --> 36:37.320
Viola? Shades, please.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.253
Here we go.

36:59.425 --> 37:00.593
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

37:00.676 --> 37:04.931
<i>I'm Don Wachtell.</i>

37:05.014 --> 37:07.725
<i>President of Mesa Verde.</i>

37:07.808 --> 37:10.478
<i>My bank took my home over a technicality.</i>

37:10.561 --> 37:14.899
<i>And I never missed a single payment.</i>
<i>It's not right. It's un-American.</i>

37:14.982 --> 37:16.651
<i>Yup!</i>

37:16.734 --> 37:18.236
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

37:18.319 --> 37:22.156
<i>Have you or a family member been wrongfully</i>
<i>evicted from your home by Mesa Verde?</i>

37:22.240 --> 37:24.992
<i>Then you may be entitled</i>
<i>to a large cash settlement.</i>

37:25.076 --> 37:28.496
<i>Call 505-503-4455 today!</i>

37:28.579 --> 37:30.623
-Are you kidding me?
PAIGE: None of that is true.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.124
RICH: Libel. It's libel.
-Defamation.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.293
That's my father you're making a fool of.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.713
-Turn it off. You know you can't do this.
-Shh. This is a good one.

37:38.714 --> 37:44.220
<i>I went into my bank to withdraw cash for groceries,</i>
<i>and I came out with a rash.</i>

37:44.303 --> 37:46.597
<i>I can't stop itching. It's everywhere.</i>

37:46.681 --> 37:48.224
DONALD:
<i>Yup!</i>

37:48.307 --> 37:49.934
SAUL:
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

37:50.017 --> 37:52.311
<i>Did you or a family member visit</i>
<i>a Mesa Verde branch</i>

37:52.395 --> 37:54.480
<i>and come into contact with black mold?</i>

37:54.563 --> 37:56.107
<i>Then you may be entitled to a...</i>

37:56.190 --> 37:58.943
There's no way in hell you can legally run these.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.195
Mm. Maybe.

38:01.279 --> 38:05.533
But, you know, we'll fight it out after they run
in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah...

38:05.616 --> 38:08.035
No, no, we will stop it
before it ever gets that far.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.121
Some might call that prior restraint.

38:10.204 --> 38:15.584
You know what? You could stop us.
Some news outlet will pick it up, they'll run for free.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.712
<i>...to open my safety-deposit box,</i>

38:17.795 --> 38:21.424
<i>and Mr. **** was standing there</i>
<i>with his pants down.</i>

38:21.507 --> 38:23.884
<i>-Bare genitals.</i>
<i>-Yup!</i>

38:23.968 --> 38:26.470
My dad never, ever did anything like that!

38:26.554 --> 38:28.848
None of this is true. This is all fantasy.

38:28.931 --> 38:32.435
Doesn't matter.
This trash airs, our reputation is in the toilet!

38:32.518 --> 38:33.769
It'll never, ever get that far.

38:33.853 --> 38:34.854
Shh.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.439
DONALD:
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

38:36.522 --> 38:39.942
<i>I'm Don Wachtell.</i>

38:40.026 --> 38:43.446
<i>The bank manager couldn't explain</i>
<i>where all the extra fees were going.</i>

38:43.529 --> 38:44.864
<i>So I followed the money trail.</i>

38:44.947 --> 38:48.743
<i>The evidence was as clear as day.</i>
<i>My bank was funding terrorism.</i>

38:48.826 --> 38:50.369
- <i>Yup!</i>
KEVIN: Just stop.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.288
-Stop it!
<i>-Hi. I'm Saul Goodman...</i>

38:52.371 --> 38:54.582
I've seen enough of this horseshit. Jesus.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.292
There's lots more.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.670
You know, I can leave you this one,
because I've got plenty of copies.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.505
PAIGE:
What do you hope to gain with all this?

39:01.589 --> 39:06.594
We agree to Acker's ridiculous demands
and you don't run this garbage?

39:06.677 --> 39:10.306
It's illegal to do that.
No lawyer can play one case off another.

39:10.389 --> 39:12.516
It is unethical, and it is blackmail.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.684
She's right.

39:13.768 --> 39:19.940
One has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Which leads me to my next topic.

39:20.024 --> 39:24.528
This is Olivia Bitsui. She's a photographer.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.031
In fact, she took this self-portrait. Really lovely.

39:27.114 --> 39:30.117
Here's another picture she took 54 years ago.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.119
-Kevin, say nothing.
KEVIN: No, Kim, I got this.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.330
-Kevin, I strongly advise...
-I know this picture.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.248
-My dad bought it, fair and square.
KIM: Kevin.

39:36.332 --> 39:39.627
I have a copy of it hanging in my office at home.

39:39.710 --> 39:44.548
I think we all just heard Mr. Wachtell admit
that he owns a copy of Olivia Bitsui's photo.

39:44.632 --> 39:48.677
A photo that looks remarkably
like the official Mesa Verde logo.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.679
That's right. We own it.

39:50.763 --> 39:53.265
SAUL: You own a copy of the photo,
you don't own the rights to it.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.809
That's copyright infringement.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.519
You'll never be able to prove that.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.229
Well, you know what?

39:59.355 --> 40:02.608
Wow. Looks like a mirror image there.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.861
So I think I can convince a judge
and probably a jury

40:05.945 --> 40:10.533
that Mesa Verde misappropriated
Miss Bitsui's intellectual property.

40:10.616 --> 40:13.160
It's not your fault. Sins of the father.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.746
But we filed an injunction.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.791
So you're gonna have to take down
all your horsey logos,

40:18.874 --> 40:21.877
or at least throw a big tarp over them,
till we can get this settled.

40:21.961 --> 40:25.172
Shouldn't take more than, I don't know,
a couple years?

40:25.256 --> 40:28.134
We'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Till next time.

40:44.358 --> 40:48.154
The problem we're facing is that none
of the so-called victims said, "Mesa Verde did this."

40:48.237 --> 40:49.405
Everybody said, "My bank."

40:49.488 --> 40:52.575
-They never used the words "Mesa Verde."
-But it's our images, our logo...

40:52.658 --> 40:56.328
Paige, it's all heavily inferred,
but it's done in a way to keep us in the courts.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.165
-We'll be going round and round.
-How do we keep them off the air?

40:59.248 --> 41:02.084
-We're gonna have to get ahead of him.
-How?

41:02.168 --> 41:05.754
We notify the stations
that they're susceptible to a libel suit...

41:05.838 --> 41:08.090
RICH:
It might be an extended game of whack-a-mole.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.760
Any way you slice this, it's a long-haul battle.
We have to take things one at a time.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.305
Meanwhile, we have to counter
the copyright injunction.

41:14.388 --> 41:17.641
PAIGE:
We can start with that. That's important...

41:20.686 --> 41:22.521
RICH: Kevin.
KIM: Kevin, Kevin.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.691
I know you're upset,
but please, don't do anything rash.

41:25.774 --> 41:29.403
Let your lawyers take care of it. We'll fix this.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.697
Kim, can I just go to the men's room?

41:32.698 --> 41:33.824
Of course. Yeah.

41:34.825 --> 41:37.453
RICH: Okay, now, with the copyright infringement,
I think we...

41:40.206 --> 41:46.587
"505-503-4455 today."

41:48.631 --> 41:50.424
Where are you?

41:52.009 --> 41:53.761
Stay there.

42:07.066 --> 42:07.942
What'll it take?

42:09.276 --> 42:11.779
Oh, you're gonna have to be more specific.

42:12.780 --> 42:18.035
I let Acker stay in his shitty little house,
and I move my call center, and the rest goes away.

42:18.118 --> 42:20.120
-Is that the game?
-Ah.

42:20.204 --> 42:24.833
As your counselor, Miss Wexler, informed you,
I'm not allowed to do that.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.335
Give me a break.

42:26.418 --> 42:31.298
You're a third-rate huckster who'd sell
your own mother's organs to get what you want.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.260
What will it take?

42:34.343 --> 42:36.595
Mind you, again,

42:36.679 --> 42:40.808
I'm not actually allowed to do any of this,
not intentionally.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.060
Cut to the chase, jackass.

42:43.143 --> 42:48.232
Well, Kevin, would you close your eyes
and imagine a world with me?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.819
Just... If you...

42:51.902 --> 42:55.823
It's a world where Mr. Acker gets
to keep his house.

42:55.906 --> 43:00.160
Plus the $45,000 you were gonna pay him
for his pain and suffering.

43:00.244 --> 43:04.081
And in this world, you throw in a public apology.

43:04.164 --> 43:10.963
And imagine a world where Native American
photographer Olivia Bitsui is compensated

43:11.046 --> 43:14.633
$200,000 for the use of her photo.

43:14.717 --> 43:17.177
In addition to receiving future credit

43:17.261 --> 43:21.015
for the inspiration and use of the logo
for Mesa Verde.

43:21.098 --> 43:24.977
Also, you know what, throw in a public apology
for Miss Bitsui while you're at it.

43:25.060 --> 43:30.691
And then, then, I can imagine a world
where the injunction disappears.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.819
And those commercials?
Well, they'll never see the light of day.

43:33.902 --> 43:37.906
Then, poof, away they go, into a vault,
never to be seen by mortal eyes again.

43:37.990 --> 43:40.409
What do you think of that world, huh, Kevin?

43:41.410 --> 43:42.995
You can open your eyes now.

43:44.288 --> 43:49.543
Heh. Can you imagine a world
where we shake hands on that? Man to man?

43:57.426 --> 44:02.097
NACHO :<i> Yeah, he just</i>
<i>dropped me off. The usual route, going south.</i>

44:02.181 --> 44:03.974
Uh-huh.

44:30.626 --> 44:33.295
Baker 2-4-1 PD.

44:33.379 --> 44:35.464
WOMAN :
<i>Baker 2-4-1, go ahead.</i>

44:35.547 --> 44:42.096
Ran a 26. Got a hit on a New Mexico plate,
1-Victor-1-5-Robert-Zebra.

44:42.179 --> 44:45.474
Gray Monte Carlo occupied by one male.

44:45.557 --> 44:49.895
Last seen headed south
on Brighton towards Lawrence.

44:49.978 --> 44:52.856
<i>Units stand by for an attempt to locate</i>
<i>on a gray Monte Carlo</i>

44:52.940 --> 44:55.776
<i>occupied by one, last seen in the area of...</i>

45:17.923 --> 45:21.468
<i>Turn off the vehicle.</i>
<i>Drop the keys out the window.</i>

45:29.893 --> 45:33.188
Turn the vehicle off and drop the keys out now!

46:13.937 --> 46:16.773
Hey, how'd it go?

46:22.654 --> 46:24.948
It was pretty perfect, right?

46:37.878 --> 46:39.546
Kim, uh...

46:41.048 --> 46:42.216
Kim.

46:43.217 --> 46:47.095
Look, apologies, all right? I'm sorry.

46:48.096 --> 46:51.767
For sandbagging you with the old switcheroo.

46:51.850 --> 46:53.477
I should have warned you.

46:53.560 --> 46:58.482
But you know what?
You being angry at me, that worked.

46:58.565 --> 47:01.860
You were concerned that Rich was suspicious.
Did he say anything?

47:01.944 --> 47:05.739
-No.
-Great. See?

47:05.822 --> 47:08.033
That anger, real anger,

47:08.116 --> 47:11.495
it worked like a protective immunity shield,
you know?

47:11.578 --> 47:15.290
I mean, hey, emotion like that, you can't fake it.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.084
No, you can't.

47:17.167 --> 47:21.004
Yeah, right? So, what did Kevin say?

47:21.088 --> 47:26.510
Uh... He said he was tired of lawyers.

47:26.593 --> 47:29.763
Wait, wait. Do the voice. You gotta do the voice.

47:31.557 --> 47:35.769
Kevin is sick of lawyers,
wants to be done with all of it.

47:35.852 --> 47:40.524
We explained that your agreement is non-binding,
but he doesn't care.

47:40.607 --> 47:42.234
He is sticking with the handshake.

47:42.317 --> 47:44.528
Boom. There you go.

47:44.611 --> 47:48.991
That's a plan cooked and served to juicy perfection.

47:49.074 --> 47:51.535
We should celebrate, really.

47:51.618 --> 47:55.038
We'll go to a steakhouse,
get a couple bottles of red wine,

47:55.122 --> 47:58.458
some tiramisu, the whole nine yards.

48:00.252 --> 48:03.130
Okay, Kim, look, I said I was sorry.

48:03.213 --> 48:05.340
And again, it worked.

48:05.424 --> 48:09.761
No way that Rich or Paige could believe
that we were in cahoots.

48:09.845 --> 48:12.556
Because guess what, we weren't.

48:14.391 --> 48:17.060
Acker gets to keep his home,
plus a nice chunk of change.

48:17.144 --> 48:20.355
Olivia Bitsui gets reparations for being cheated.

48:20.439 --> 48:24.443
And Kevin still gets his call center.
Everybody wins.

48:24.526 --> 48:26.987
-You win, Jimmy.
-What?

48:27.070 --> 48:28.030
You win.

48:30.115 --> 48:34.244
Uh, yeah. Well, I mean-- Well, we win. Us.

48:35.245 --> 48:37.331
No, I didn't.

48:37.414 --> 48:40.000
What didn't you get that you wanted?

48:41.043 --> 48:44.046
-I don't trust you.
-Why?

48:45.672 --> 48:48.800
You played me.

48:48.884 --> 48:51.595
You made me the sucker again.

48:51.678 --> 48:55.474
Again? What-- Wait.
How can you be the sucker? It was your plan.

48:55.557 --> 48:57.684
Oh, fuck you, Jimmy.

48:57.768 --> 49:01.688
God. I-- You know what?

49:01.772 --> 49:03.982
I can't do this anymore.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.233
Kim, I was just--

49:05.317 --> 49:11.073
No, you turned you and me versus the bank
into you versus me.

49:11.156 --> 49:14.326
And it is not just this.
It's the same thing, over and over again.

49:14.409 --> 49:17.162
No, I kept things from you to protect you.

49:17.245 --> 49:21.875
Look, if I got caught, and God forbid,
you're questioned under oath,

49:21.958 --> 49:23.835
you have plausible deniability.

49:23.919 --> 49:25.629
Jesus, Jimmy.

49:25.712 --> 49:29.675
You can excuse stabbing me in the back
by making it about protecting me?

49:29.758 --> 49:32.302
Is that-- Is that really supposed
to justify everything?

49:32.386 --> 49:35.013
Okay, Kim, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right?

49:35.097 --> 49:38.850
-It will-- It will never happen again.
-That's a lie.

49:38.934 --> 49:41.937
I swear. I swear, it won't.

49:42.020 --> 49:46.191
Look me in the eye
and tell me it'll never happen again.

49:49.736 --> 49:50.821
You can't.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.615
I don't believe you.

49:54.616 --> 49:57.035
You don't believe yourself.

49:57.119 --> 50:01.415
It is a lie. You lie. I lie.

50:01.498 --> 50:05.627
This has to end. I cannot keep living like this.

50:05.711 --> 50:08.672
-No, no, Kim, we can fix this.
-Shut up. Jimmy. Jimmy.

50:08.755 --> 50:10.632
You know this has to change.

50:10.716 --> 50:14.136
If you don't see it, I don't know what to say,
because we are at a breaking point.

50:14.219 --> 50:16.179
-Oh, God! No.
-Either we end this now--

50:16.263 --> 50:22.811
Either we end this now and enjoy the time we had
and go our separate ways, or we're...

50:22.894 --> 50:24.062
Or what?

50:25.063 --> 50:27.733
Or we're-- I mean...

50:29.943 --> 50:31.403
Or maybe...

50:38.493 --> 50:40.287
Maybe we get married?
