00:02.236 --> 00:04.238
(Mindy)
Every girl dreams
of her perfect proposal,

00:04.305 --> 00:06.574
but when I imagined the day that
Danny Castellano would propose,

00:06.640 --> 00:09.009
I did not imagine
it would look like this.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.315
I can't believe
we're having a baby.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.684
Okay.
Get up.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.685
Get your stuff.
Let's go.

00:17.751 --> 00:18.752
We're going down
to City Hall.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.188
What?
Why?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.422
For a quickie
shame wedding.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.456
Quickie shame wedding?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.258
Yeah, we say
the baby was conceived today.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.659
Seven months from now,
we can be like,

00:25.726 --> 00:27.328
"Oh, wow, we had
an 11-pound premie."

00:27.395 --> 00:28.396
Boom, we're good
with God.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.530
Let's go.
Grab it.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.032
No, no, I don't want you
to propose out of shame.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.367
It should be
out of love

00:33.434 --> 00:36.237
or, at a minimum, for ratings
for a reality show, Danny,

00:36.304 --> 00:38.239
and certainly not
in the doctors' longue

00:38.306 --> 00:39.673
late at night
when Morgan is sleeping

00:39.740 --> 00:41.609
with his hands down his pants
five feet away.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.577
[snoring]

00:43.644 --> 00:46.547
Okay, yeah, maybe now's
not the best time.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.550
[hip-hop music]

00:49.617 --> 00:51.152
*

00:52.353 --> 00:55.189
Hey, buddy boy.
What's going on in there?

00:55.256 --> 00:56.690
You make
any new friends?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.692
You meet the guts,
the kidneys?

00:58.759 --> 01:01.095
Hey, don't let anybody
push you around, okay?

01:01.162 --> 01:03.364
You're a Castellano.
I love you.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.698
That's very sweet,
but you know what?

01:04.765 --> 01:05.799
I actually need to pack.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.368
Otherwise I'm gonna miss
my flight.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.736
Hold on a second.
I just want to go over

01:08.802 --> 01:10.471
the state capitals with him
one more time.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.472
No, do not
make him a nerd.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.274
Okay.

01:13.341 --> 01:16.210
I'm gonna be a dad.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.147
Okay, are you sure you want
to go back to San Francisco?

01:19.213 --> 01:20.648
Why don't you stay here
in New York?

01:20.714 --> 01:22.650
You could work
until the little guy comes

01:22.716 --> 01:25.686
and then quit and take care
of him and make sauce.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.688
Danny, this is
not Boko Haram.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.257
All right?
I'm not gonna quit my job.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.225
I still want to start
that fertility clinic with Rob.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.162
Okay, but you're pregnant.
It's the 20th century.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.763
A woman can have
professional ambitions

01:35.829 --> 01:38.199
and still have a family,
but rich women.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.534
I get it, but sometimes
family has to come first,

01:40.601 --> 01:42.370
and your family--
our family--

01:42.436 --> 01:43.871
is here
in New York City.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.873
Well, I have family
in San Francisco.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.508
Who, your brother Rishi?

01:47.575 --> 01:49.543
You haven't seen him once
since you've been out there.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.845
Hey, we have made
several lunch plans,

01:51.912 --> 01:53.714
and, yes,
he canceled them all,

01:53.781 --> 01:54.882
but always
for a good reason.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.284
Like, one time,
he was working

01:56.350 --> 01:57.551
on this really dope rap.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.254
The other time,
he fell asleep.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.289
But it doesn't matter.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.723
The only family
that matters now

02:02.790 --> 02:05.559
is you, me,
and little Mindy.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.695
Now, I have to get
on a plane.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.602
I'll move
to San Francisco with you.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.404
Really?
Yeah.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.572
To San Francisco?
I kind of like
San Francisco.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.174
San Francisco--
it's grown on me.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.176
I don't mind wearing
a fleece to a restaurant.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.212
It's cool.
What about your mom?

02:24.278 --> 02:25.579
I'll fly home
every Sunday.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.381
Take her to church.
But that's not important.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.917
What's important is
exactly what you just said--

02:29.983 --> 02:32.453
this, us,
the three of us.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.454
Thank you, Danny.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.855
I love you.
I love you.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.159
Okay, you, pack your bags.
Go to San Francisco.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.294
And I'm gonna stay here
in New York,

02:40.361 --> 02:41.462
and I'm gonna
break the news to Jeremy.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.663
He's not gonna be happy,
'cause, you know,

02:42.730 --> 02:44.265
we're leaving him
in the lurch.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.633
It's not cool.
Just tell him
I'm pregnant.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.435
What?
No, are you nuts?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.669
No, no, no, no.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.538
We're not telling anyone
until your second trimester.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.705
That's how it works.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.607
Danny, that's such
a long time from now.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.709
What if I forget?

02:55.776 --> 02:59.213
And, you, you'll tell me
if she blabs, right?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.682
We stick together.
Ah, I love this guy.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.284
Okay, it's probably a girl.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.518
No, no, no,
it's a boy.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.454
I can hear
his penis.
What?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.956
Oh, yeah, it's big.
Oh, God.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.293
(Danny)
Oh, just the guy
I was looking for.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.462
Jeremy, I need to talk to you
about something.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.464
Yeah, of course.
Hold those doors. Oh!

03:16.530 --> 03:18.866
Cliff, how's it going?
Haven't seen you in a while.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.801
Yeah, I'm actually
doing really well.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.470
It's a good time
to be a divorce attorney.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.671
I'll tell you that.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.706
Three years after gay marriage,
and those divorces

03:25.773 --> 03:26.940
are finally rolling in.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.442
We're actually moving
to nicer offices.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.577
Oh, wonderful.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.445
See, everybody's moving
to greener pastures:

03:31.512 --> 03:32.713
Peter, Lauren, Mindy.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.315
You know what
the brave thing would be?

03:34.382 --> 03:36.984
Is stay behind
in your dry, brown pasture

03:37.050 --> 03:40.388
that but for a spark
might set ablaze.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.590
Sure, well, let me know
if you hear of anyone

03:42.656 --> 03:43.857
looking
for office space.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.394
Oh, Danny, what was it
you wanted to tell me?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.961
Uh...

03:48.028 --> 03:52.666
I wanted to--
Do you want my watch?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.469
Do I want your watch?
Yeah.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.505
Yes, please.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.639
[whispering]
Son of a bitch.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.375
What?
Nothing, take it.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.710
Thanks.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.912
Huh.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.547
(Morgan)
Yeah, this guy in the subway,

04:06.614 --> 04:08.248
I asked him if he
was done with his coffee,

04:08.316 --> 04:10.584
and he was sleeping,
so took it.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.520
Wait a minute, Morgan,
is that a dad penguin

04:12.586 --> 04:15.723
protecting his baby penguin
from the Arctic cold?

04:15.789 --> 04:18.426
Well, yeah, it's
the "Nature's Dads" issue,

04:18.492 --> 04:20.861
so good call,
Eisenstein.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.862
[chuckles]

04:21.929 --> 04:24.798
Can I borrow it?

04:24.865 --> 04:27.601
Yeah, sure.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.571
So cute, it's just
nestled up next to him.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.411
God, I hope
my credit's okay.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.479
You know what, Rob?

04:38.546 --> 04:40.648
Whatever happens,
we're in this together.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.715
Okay.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.386
So unfortunately,
you have been denied

04:45.453 --> 04:46.720
for your small business loan.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.322
What?
Damn it, Gurgler.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.857
I'll kill you.
What have you been doing?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.959
Because of your credit,
Miss Lahiri.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.293
Ex-squeeze me?

04:53.361 --> 04:54.962
No, no, no, no,
I don't think so.

04:55.028 --> 04:58.399
I have exquisite credit.
I have 25 credit cards.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.733
It's not that.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.804
It says you were a guarantor
for an apartment that defaulted.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.439
Oh, no.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.608
The apartment that I cosigned
with my little brother.

05:10.110 --> 05:10.944
(Mindy)
Wait, fine, my credit's bad.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.613
Do you accept street cred?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.748
Well, Dr. Gurgler's
credit is fine.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.784
He could take out the loan
in just his name.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.388
So I-I have to assume
all financial responsibility?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.956
No, I'm a coward
in every sense of the word.

05:23.023 --> 05:23.957
One second, please.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.993
Hey, man,
I just convinced Danny

05:26.059 --> 05:27.361
to move out
to California.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.797
This is a man who thinks
America ends with Nebraska.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.332
Just--I don't want to give up
on this practice already.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.801
It's gonna be
so amazing.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.636
Yeah, it is.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.605
Okay, fine,
I'll take out the loan.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.873
Thank you.
Hear that, little Mindy?

05:39.940 --> 05:42.876
We're gonna be a-okay.
Who's little Mindy?

05:42.943 --> 05:45.012
Um, uh, it's just
what I call my crotch.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.447
Oh.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.017
(Danny)
Thanks for meeting
on such short notice, Mel.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.852
I want to amend
my will.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.887
So you no longer
wish to leave your estate

05:53.954 --> 05:55.623
to Annette Castellano

05:55.689 --> 05:58.125
and the Priests
of St. Anthony's Defense Fund.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.893
No, I still want
to do that.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.397
I also want to include
Mindy Lahiri to it.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.432
Why?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.799
That woman is terrible
with money.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.368
Yeah--
She opened up another
credit card last week

06:08.436 --> 06:09.970
for a free cupcake.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.839
Yeah, well, circumstances
have changed, Mel,

06:11.905 --> 06:13.841
and I need to make sure
she's taken care of.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.710
Hey, I have some papers
for you to sign.

06:16.777 --> 06:17.978
Excuse me, Mel.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.380
I am starting
an autograph collection.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.015
You guys continue
with what you were saying.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.050
No, I'm good.
You sure?

06:23.116 --> 06:25.886
Yeah, get out of here.
I got to go.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.788
Well, Danny, I can make
that change to your will

06:27.855 --> 06:29.089
in a couple of days.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.859
Great, 'cause I need all
my affairs in order this week.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.627
(Danny)
I don't have much time.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.062
(Mel)
Well, I hate to do it,
but okay.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.732
(Morgan)
Come on, get in, get in.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.601
Fine.
All right.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.702
Oh, my God.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.771
This better
be good, Morgan.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.405
The reason I called you all
in here--

06:45.473 --> 06:48.408
Dr. C is dying.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.409
[both gasp]

06:49.477 --> 06:50.410
What?

06:50.478 --> 06:53.681
Which one's Dr. C?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.415
[phone rings]

06:55.483 --> 06:56.584
(Mindy)
Hey, Cliff.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.486
It's Mindy,
your favorite ex-girlfriend.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.754
(Cliff)
Oh, wow, I'm actually surprised
to hear from you.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.690
I'm fairly certain
I blocked your number.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.124
(Mindy)
Okay, here's the deal.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.893
I need some
pro bono legal advice.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.861
Who do I sue
to fix my credit score?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.497
Mindy, I don't have time
for this, okay?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.498
I'm very busy, all right?

07:10.564 --> 07:11.899
I'm trying to unload
my office space.

07:11.965 --> 07:12.966
I got movers here
right now.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.602
Oh, cool.
Where are you going?

07:14.668 --> 07:15.803
Oh, well, you know...

07:15.869 --> 07:17.638
[phone beeps]
It's a funny story, actually.

07:17.705 --> 07:18.906
Hello?
Hello!

07:18.972 --> 07:20.107
Damn it, Cliff.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.047
Rishi, it's your sister.
Open this door this minute.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.149
Hey, how you doing?
Get in here, okay?

07:29.216 --> 07:31.151
My landlord--
he can't catch me outside.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.686
What?

07:32.753 --> 07:36.624
But he can't do anything
to me in here,

07:36.690 --> 07:40.027
'cause California's got
mad squatters' rights, son.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.162
That is not how
squatters' rights work.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.131
Come here, come here.
I missed you so much.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.699
I missed you too.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.935
What the hell, man?
Why haven't you paid your rent?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.537
You totally ruined
my credit.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.739
Sorry, woman, it's just
that I'm a rapper now,

07:51.805 --> 07:53.507
and that comes
with cash flow problems.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.242
* It got hard

07:55.308 --> 07:57.177
* I couldn't pay
my bills *

07:57.244 --> 07:59.079
* Now I'm down
in the alley *

07:59.146 --> 08:01.081
* Giving bitches
their thrills *

08:01.148 --> 08:02.650
That last part's
not true, okay?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.017
I haven't gotten laid
in six months.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.052
I'm pretty lonely.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.887
Okay, well,
that rap was mad tight,

08:06.954 --> 08:08.656
but I am
mad-mad at you.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.490
Rishi, you cannot be
this little idiot

08:10.558 --> 08:11.892
that I have to take care
of anymore,

08:11.959 --> 08:13.761
'cause--spoiler alert--

08:13.827 --> 08:15.529
there's gonna be
a new stupid, little idiot

08:15.596 --> 08:17.030
that I have
to take care of.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.899
Yeah, I'm gonna
have a baby.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.934
You're gonna--
In there?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.836
Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.038
It makes perfect sense.
You're totally showing.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.239
No.
Yeah.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.908
Not yet, not yet.
It's months too early.

08:27.975 --> 08:28.909
Don't go
down this path.

08:28.976 --> 08:29.977
Oh, my mistake.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.812
Well, anyway, you should
sit down, all right?

08:31.879 --> 08:32.980
Oh, my gosh, wow.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.948
You haven't told Mom
and Dad, have you?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.651
Have I told Mom and Dad
that I am unmarried

08:37.718 --> 08:39.052
and pregnant
with a white man's baby?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.088
No, there is a world
in which I never tell them.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.756
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be an uncle.

08:42.823 --> 08:43.924
I cannot believe it.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.158
I'm gonna steal
his little nose,

08:45.225 --> 08:46.694
and I'm gonna learn
how to do magic.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.096
I'm gonna take quarters out
from behind his little ears.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.164
What quarters, Rishi?
You have no money.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.667
I know, but
I'm working on stuff.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.169
I've been picking up
some odd jobs.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.772
Come on, Rishi,
you have a degree in biology.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.775
You can get a job--

09:01.842 --> 09:04.812
Wait, you could be
a med tech at my new practice.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.780
Really?
You think I'd be good at that?

09:06.847 --> 09:09.316
No, but no one except your
sister is ever gonna hire you.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.151
Okay, but first you're gonna
have to interview

09:11.218 --> 09:12.219
with my partner,
so please,

09:12.285 --> 09:13.553
go put on some clothes.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.589
(Jeremy)
Morgan, you're being dramatic.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.924
I don't see
how that is necessary.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.058
We never use
the white board.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.960
Danny is not dying, guys.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.294
He's the healthiest person
I know.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.930
His favorite junk food
is raisins.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.898
Well, he has been
hella emo lately.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.867
Also, also,
he changed his will today,

09:26.934 --> 09:28.636
and he bought
a gravestone.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.903
(Danny)
Okay, where is everyone?

09:29.970 --> 09:32.640
I'm signing
for packages out here.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.342
What are you guys doing?
What's up?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.778
Morgan, I told you I'm not
buying lunch anymore, okay?

09:37.845 --> 09:39.947
The last time, you ordered
a T-shirt from the deli.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.581
Okay, I know
you're angry,

09:41.649 --> 09:42.916
and I want you to know
that I hear you,

09:42.983 --> 09:44.251
and that's okay
to feel like that.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.919
Yeah, I know.
Thanks.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.655
Are you free tonight?
No, I have plans.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.156
But I think grandmother
wants to bail.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.991
I obviously not
looking in your direction.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.660
You want to come over
to my place tonight?

09:52.726 --> 09:54.662
There's something
really important

09:54.728 --> 09:55.963
I need
to talk to you about.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.931
It's all good.
(Morgan)
I'm so sorry.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.667
I don't know
if you're talking to me or not.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.668
It's a little confusing.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.969
Sure, of course
I can come over.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.603
Whatever you need.
Great.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.806
Okay.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.340
[all whispering at once]

10:07.407 --> 10:08.341
Hey, guys.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.342
Shh.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.644
I know I don't
say this a lot,

10:10.711 --> 10:11.645
but...

10:11.712 --> 10:13.313
[inhales, exhales deeply]

10:13.380 --> 10:17.150
You're great coworkers
and amazing friends.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.086
Thanks.

10:19.152 --> 10:22.089
[hums Death March]

10:25.258 --> 10:27.961
So, Rishi, when Mindy said
we should hire the guy

10:28.028 --> 10:29.129
who ruined her credit,

10:29.196 --> 10:31.098
I was concerned.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.766
Yeah, you know,
I would be too.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.903
It's just--I was going through
a really emotional time,

10:35.969 --> 10:37.705
and I don't know,
Dr. Gurgler,

10:37.771 --> 10:40.373
if you've ever been
through anything like that.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.642
Well, actually
I have.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.678
I recently went through
a devastating breakup,

10:44.745 --> 10:47.214
even had a good cry
in the car on the way over here.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.318
But, um, anyway,
all is forgiven.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.786
Yeah, boy.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.087
You're the man
now, dog.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.355
That is very sweet.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.924
Now, Rishi,
why don't you tell him

10:56.990 --> 10:58.425
a little bit
about your freelancing?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.727
Oh, that's great.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.661
Do you have a reference
we can call?

11:01.729 --> 11:04.297
Uh, yes, I do, actually,
and he'd love to talk with you.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.666
I don't know his name,
but if he were here right now--

11:06.734 --> 11:08.668
Sorry, what do you mean
you don't know his name?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.938
I don't know.
We just call him Big Murder.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.039
[phone rings]

11:12.105 --> 11:14.708
Your boss's name
is Big Murder?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.676
Listen, I've got
a very pressing work matter

11:16.744 --> 11:18.445
that requires
my immediate attention,

11:18.511 --> 11:20.380
so I gots to go,
but I'll be right back.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.381
Yeah, I'm--
Wait, what?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.183
Rishi.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.217
Rishi!

11:24.284 --> 11:26.019
Look, I know
he's your brother, but--

11:26.086 --> 11:28.155
Listen, I know this has
to be a business decision,

11:28.221 --> 11:29.757
but Rishi is not
a charity case.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.058
He got good grades
at Stanford,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.793
and I can tell you
he is a good kid.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.061
Is he?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.963
'Cause it looks like
he's outside dealing drugs.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.038
I cannot believe
you are a drug dealer.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.741
Whoa, all right,
I am barely a drug dealer.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.943
I just sell weed
and, like, everything else.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.711
You know what?
I'm gonna call Mom and Dad.

11:51.779 --> 11:52.880
And they're
gonna kill you,

11:52.946 --> 11:54.347
and then you're
gonna get reincarnated,

11:54.414 --> 11:55.816
and they're gonna
kill you again.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.084
Yeah, fine,
you call them, okay?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.218
'Cause I'm gonna call 'em,

11:58.285 --> 11:59.920
and I'm gonna tell 'em
you're knocked up.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.989
Wait, no, no, don't. do that.
Fine, mine is worse.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.190
But you know what?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.092
I'm happy this happened,
because I almost hired

12:05.158 --> 12:07.027
a stupid drug dealer
to come work at my practice.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.328
Oh, hey, you might
not believe this,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.330
but marijuana legalization
is an issue

12:10.397 --> 12:11.865
that I'm really
passionate about.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.201
Oh, do not try to take
the high road on this one.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.170
Mindy Jr., listen up,
this rant--it applies to you.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.472
Marijuana
is the worst.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.474
It makes you fat
and lazy.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.276
Is that what you think
America's problem is?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.945
There's not enough
fat and lazy people?

12:25.012 --> 12:26.746
At least cocaine
has an industrious spirit.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.816
"Oh, I'm gonna sell stocks
on Wall Street faster.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.083
Oh, I need
to dance more."

12:30.150 --> 12:31.484
You know what?
You're coming with me.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.486
We're gonna go to your boss,
and you're gonna quit.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.488
Okay, fine, I'll quit.
All right, just relax.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.524
We're in public.
You're illing my steez.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.460
Talk normal!
Come on!

12:40.527 --> 12:43.096
(Danny)
Hey, thanks for coming.
Have a seat, man.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.066
[sighing]

12:46.133 --> 12:48.936
Look, Jeremy,

12:49.002 --> 12:50.537
I'm not gonna be
at the practice anymore,

12:50.603 --> 12:54.007
because, well,
I'm not gonna be here.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.509
Oh, my God.
Morgan was right.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.777
What?

12:57.845 --> 12:59.212
Don't say anything else.
Danny, I know.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.413
You do?
Yeah.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.049
Danny, I'm so sorry.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.350
What?
You're sorry?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.085
Look, Jeremy,
I'm sorry.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.321
I mean, I'm abandoning
the practice.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.790
The very fact that you're even
thinking about the practice

13:10.858 --> 13:12.826
at a time like this--
it's a testament

13:12.893 --> 13:17.097
to the selfless way
you lived--live your life.

13:17.164 --> 13:21.268
Well, thanks, pal.
You're taking it
amazingly.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.070
I have to ask you,
aren't you afraid?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.804
Yeah, I don't want
to leave.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.173
I'm gonna miss you guys,

13:26.239 --> 13:28.175
not to mention
New York-style pizza.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.844
You don't know.
Maybe they have that there.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.213
Nah, it's all
Chinese food and tacos.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.314
Hey, I'll tell you
this much,

13:34.381 --> 13:35.916
I'm gonna come back
and visit you.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.551
Oh, my aunt Imogen
does that

13:38.618 --> 13:41.955
to warn me of things.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.090
Cool.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.491
How about Mindy?
What did she say?

13:44.557 --> 13:45.926
Oh, she was happy.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.895
She said it was the best present
I ever gave her.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.296
What?
Yeah.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.431
What a monster.
Ah, she's okay.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.200
Hey, you want
a drink?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.137
Get you a scotch?
Just a second.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.271
Okay.
Just a minute longer.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.073
Yup.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.615
Get in, get in, get in.
Okay, okay.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.283
Whew.
How'd it go?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.852
Yeah, so Big Murder--
he wouldn't let me quit,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.888
but I think it's
for the best, you know?

14:14.955 --> 14:15.923
What?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.357
He gonna force you
to be a drug dealer?

14:17.424 --> 14:18.625
Seems that way, yeah.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.594
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

14:21.661 --> 14:25.098
It's gonna be okay.
I just came here
to start a fertility clinic.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.101
No, no.
No.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.103
What are you doing?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.271
Woman, where
are you going?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.410
Do not tell
your father about this.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.380
Hey, you can't kill me!
I tweeted I was coming here.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.649
Leo, I got you covered
for award season.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.184
All right,
I have to go.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.385
May I help you?

14:45.452 --> 14:47.988
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I am looking for Big Murder.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.522
What are you,
like, his math tutor?

14:49.589 --> 14:53.126
You know, I became a drug dealer
to break stereotypes like that.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.228
Wait, you're
Big Murder?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.630
They call me Big Murder because
I killed it business school,

14:57.697 --> 14:59.132
but my friends
call me Greg,

14:59.199 --> 15:02.469
and I don't know
what our dynamic is yet.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.473
Oh.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.375
Well, it is--
it is bad.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.011
How dare you, sir,
menace my little brother

15:11.078 --> 15:12.379
into working
for you, okay?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.247
The only one that gets
to menace him is me.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.315
I didn't menace him.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.651
I offered him a raise,
and he accepted--20%.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.652
What?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.254
Rishi, what the hell
is wrong with you?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.523
Look, I'm sorry, but what
was I supposed to do, okay?

15:23.590 --> 15:24.924
You're not gonna hire me,

15:24.992 --> 15:26.493
and I called up
Silicon Valley to get a job,

15:26.559 --> 15:28.495
and they offered me
something in HR.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.562
What is that?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.198
Rishi's making
a smart business move.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.200
He told me you were only
gonna pay him minimum wage.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.201
Oh, boo-hoo.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.468
First of all,
in San Francisco,

15:35.535 --> 15:37.937
minimum wage
is, like, $5 million an hour.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.206
He's worth it.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.574
He spearheaded our day after
Thanksgiving Green Friday sale.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.076
He's one
of my best guys.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.144
Really?
Yes.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.712
Thank you,
Big Murder.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.014
I'm sorry.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.481
Are you getting validation
from this guy?

15:48.548 --> 15:51.418
What?
No.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.220
Oh, my God,
you straight up love this dude.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.221
I thought
you were in this

15:54.287 --> 15:55.555
for the dollar,
dollar bill, y'all,

15:55.622 --> 15:57.124
but really, you just
like the feeling

15:57.190 --> 15:58.291
of someone
believing in you.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.426
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.194
Everyone else
thinks I'm a screw-up.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.495
I can't pay bills,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.331
and did you know that I keep
my side-view mirrors

16:04.397 --> 16:06.966
attached with straight up
derkt tape?

16:07.034 --> 16:08.735
Rishi, I don't think
you're a screw-up.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.737
Look, I'm sorry
that I'm so hard on you.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.241
And, yeah, I know
that Greg is handsome and cool

16:14.307 --> 16:17.510
and that photo implies
that he owns a boat.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.578
I do.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.647
Wish I could get down
to the marina more often.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.516
But I'm your sister,
and I have your back.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.386
And you know what?
You can still work for me.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.654
Really?
Mm-hmm.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.755
I can offer you
a 30% raise,

16:28.821 --> 16:31.458
and you can throw
a party on the HMS THC.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.326
I mean,
I never use it.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.663
Ooh, that's interesting.
Sis, counter offer.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.531
Okay, my counter offer is

16:38.598 --> 16:40.367
that if you continue
to be a drug dealer,

16:40.433 --> 16:42.001
I will kill you.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.136
Then I will kill Greg,

16:43.203 --> 16:45.272
and I will burn
this building to the ground.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.374
Okay, well, then
I will be in the car.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.441
Thanks.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.776
I'll never forget you,
Big Murder.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.178
Get out of here.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.745
No, you're not
gonna keep in touch with him.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.247
You know what?
I'm on to you.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.084
With your perfect face
and your awesome suit.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.786
No, I'm not as stupid
as my hotness would imply.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.688
You know, Dr. Lahiri,
I could offer you

17:01.754 --> 17:04.391
seven figures a year
writing phony prescriptions.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.359
I'm in.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.129
I am not in.
Good test, though.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.198
Thank you, Greg.
Great to meet you.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.532
Good-bye.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.668
[indistinct conversation]

17:15.735 --> 17:17.604
What's going on?
What, are you throwing a party?

17:17.670 --> 17:20.407
I had my dessert for the day,
a cup of orange juice, so...

17:20.473 --> 17:23.443
Danny, in the light
of your departure,

17:23.510 --> 17:25.712
the office has put together
a little tribute for you.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.380
For me?
Yeah.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.149
Wow, guys, that's
really nice of you.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.150
Thank you.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.419
Morgan and I
wrote a song.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.189
(both)
* We're gonna miss you,
Dr. C *

17:36.256 --> 17:38.158
* We're gonna miss
those eyebrows *

17:38.225 --> 17:39.559
I cannot do it.
I'm sorry.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.794
I don't understand.
Why is this happening?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.830
You're too young
and beautiful to die.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.532
What?
I'm not dying.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.534
I'm going
to San Francisco.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.337
Wait, what?
Yeah, I told you that
last night.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.839
No, no, no,
you told me to my face,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.142
"I'm dying.
Take care of Mindy.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.410
And by 'take care of,'
I mean sexually."

17:57.477 --> 17:58.678
Okay, I never said that.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.180
Why would Morgan
make that up?

18:00.247 --> 18:02.315
Thank you.
How can you
and Mindy leave?

18:02.382 --> 18:04.151
What's gonna happen
to the rest of us?

18:04.217 --> 18:06.119
I refuse to work
anywhere else.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.488
I love being
a paralegal here.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.723
Guys, I'm so sorry
for the confusion.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.459
You know what?
Don't apologize to us.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.562
Apologize to the Stanton Island
Catholic Boys' Choir.

18:15.628 --> 18:20.433
(boys)
* Amazing grace

18:20.500 --> 18:22.169
* How sweet

18:23.770 --> 18:25.238
(boy)
Wait, you're not dying?

18:25.305 --> 18:27.540
We were supposed to sing
at a bank opening today.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.677
Look, I'm sorry, kids.
I'm a big booster of you guys.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.445
You'll understand
one day.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.546
I did it for a girl.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.814
(all)
Eww.

18:34.881 --> 18:35.848
"Eww," indeed.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.284
Danny,
aren't you ashamed,

18:37.350 --> 18:39.486
disappointing
singing children like that?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.687
You make me sick.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.789
You know, when you were dying,
we all loved you.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.124
Now you're my least favorite
person in the office.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.293
You're no one to me!

18:46.359 --> 18:47.727
You know what?
I've had it with you guys.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.662
Okay, I'm moving away
'cause Mindy's pregnant.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.264
(boys)
Eww.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.800
Wait, for reals?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.168
Yeah.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.237
[laughs]

18:57.304 --> 18:59.172
Are you serious?
Yeah.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.707
[all talking at once]

19:00.773 --> 19:03.276
Oh, oh, Morgan
Grandmother Castellano.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.512
That's got
a good ring to it.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.146
(Mindy)
Hey, there you are.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.415
I have great news.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.816
I sorted everything
out with Rishi.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.284
He's no longer
a drug dealer,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.685
so he can work
at the practice now.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.421
Are you insane?
No!

19:14.487 --> 19:16.456
All right, this is not
some two-bit family business

19:16.523 --> 19:18.625
where you can store
your unemployable relatives.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.159
This is not Wahlburgers.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.728
Okay, Rob, listen.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.564
I know that hiring Rishi would
be a risky business decision.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.266
Yes.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.735
But he's
my brother, Rob,

19:28.801 --> 19:30.470
and more than that,
I want to work at a place

19:30.537 --> 19:31.838
that gives people
second chances.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.706
At my old practice,
basically everyone there

19:33.773 --> 19:35.174
was damaged goods.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.577
Yeah, well, no wonder
you wanted to leave that place.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.745
[sighs]

19:38.811 --> 19:41.914
Yeah, well, maybe
I don't want to.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.716
Wait.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.184
What are you saying?

19:45.252 --> 19:46.953
I don't know,
maybe Mark and Donnie Wahlberg

19:47.019 --> 19:47.954
are on to something.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.622
Maybe when you're
starting a business,

19:49.689 --> 19:50.890
only three things
should matter:

19:50.957 --> 19:54.961
family, second chances,
and juicy, delicious hamburgers.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.430
I'll pay you back for the loan,
but we're done.

19:57.497 --> 20:01.234
I'm sorry, Rob.
Good-bye.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.803
What?
Mindy, Mindy!

20:03.870 --> 20:06.806
Mark and Donnie Wahlberg
are never on to something!

20:06.873 --> 20:08.708
(Mindy)
I can't believe
I'm leaving Stanford early,

20:08.775 --> 20:10.577
just another pregnant
teen drop-out.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.912
I mean, I just feel
like such a failure.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.748
Rob was my one shot to get
my own fertility practice.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.351
Well, what makes you think
that that white man

20:18.418 --> 20:20.320
is the only reason
you can have your own practice?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.622
I mean, in terms
of entitlement and personality,

20:22.689 --> 20:24.357
you the whitest man
I know.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.293
God, Rishi, that's, like,
the nicest thing

20:26.359 --> 20:27.527
that anyone's
ever said to me,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.262
but how am I supposed
to do it now?

20:29.329 --> 20:30.730
All alone,
expecting a baby?

20:30.797 --> 20:32.999
Come on.
Well, why not, huh?

20:33.065 --> 20:36.403
I'm doing this fellowship
on my own, and I have Neil.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.706
Sure, it's more work
than I ever had before,

20:39.772 --> 20:42.709
but with my son,
I have a better reason to work

20:42.775 --> 20:44.377
than I ever had before.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.379
Huh.
My own practice.

20:46.446 --> 20:51.318
Even if I wanted to,
where would I even start?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.552
(Danny)
Oh, hey, Cliff.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.653
Danny, how are you?

20:53.720 --> 20:54.854
Good, how you doing?
Good.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.457
Hey, I heard the big news.
Congratulations.

20:57.524 --> 21:00.327
Well, got to tell you,
we're really excited.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.994
Yeah, yeah,
and you're the father?

21:02.061 --> 21:04.631
Yes, of course
I'm the father.
Okay.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.265
You know, Cliff,
you may not know this,

21:06.333 --> 21:07.400
but Mindy and I
are a great couple.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.535
Okay, cool.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.470
Hey, you know,
she called me the other day.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.638
She did?
Wait, why?

21:11.704 --> 21:14.307
I don't know.
Oh, that's funny.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.008
She's calling me again
right now.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.810
She is?
Yeah.

21:17.877 --> 21:18.878
Mindy, hey.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.347
Hey, Cliff.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.549
Hey, do you still have
that office space available?

21:22.615 --> 21:23.850
My office space?
Yeah, it is.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.485
Why do you ask?

21:25.552 --> 21:26.819
Because I want it.

21:26.886 --> 21:30.490
You want it?
Wait, what?
