01:48.080 --> 01:53.985
NARRATOR.’ On December 1, 2002, Dilawar,
a young Afghan taxi driver,

01:54.052 --> 01:56.418
took three passengers for a ride.

02:01.126 --> 02:03.094
He never returned home.

02:20.512 --> 02:22.844
(MACHINE GUN FIRING)

02:32.457 --> 02:36.723
CURTIS: When the sun started
to go down, the sand started blowing,

02:36.795 --> 02:38.228
so it was like a big dust bowl.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.491
And I'm thinking, "Boy,
is it gonna be like this every night?"

02:42.167 --> 02:45.864
CORSETTI: l rememberwalking in there
for the first time, and the smell...

02:45.937 --> 02:48.963
The smell is the first thing that hit you.

02:49.441 --> 02:52.604
Being from D.C.,
if you've ever been to the National Zoo,

02:52.677 --> 02:55.874
when you walk into
the elephant house there,

02:55.947 --> 02:57.437
that's the best way to describe it.

02:58.517 --> 03:01.918
There was a few of us that lived
in the prison, and I was one of them.

03:02.420 --> 03:05.253
They built it up to be a big, scary place
to the prisoners.

03:07.959 --> 03:09.085
(EXPLOSION)

03:09.161 --> 03:11.254
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

03:19.271 --> 03:23.935
NARRA TOR: After the invasion of
Afghanistan, U.S. forces occupied Bagram,

03:24.009 --> 03:25.340
an old Soviet airbase,

03:25.410 --> 03:29.005
as a place to collect and interrogate
thousands of detainees

03:29.080 --> 03:32.208
captured throughout Afghanistan
and Pakistan.

03:32.284 --> 03:35.117
CURTIS: These were suspected Taliban.

03:35.187 --> 03:40.181
They were being caught by Special Forces
throughout the countryside,

03:40.258 --> 03:46.356
brought to Bagram to be held, interrogated,
determine if they were a high-value prisoner.

03:47.532 --> 03:51.059
MORDEN.’ These were not nice people at all.

03:51.136 --> 03:56.005
They were very evil people who,
you know, definitely had violent intentions.

03:57.142 --> 04:02.774
NARRATOR.’ On December 5, 2002, Dilawar,
the taxi driver, was brought to Bagram.

04:03.582 --> 04:08.110
He was designated a PUC,
”Person Under Control, ” number 421.

04:08.753 --> 04:12.450
He was something to do with
a triggerman for a rocket attack,

04:13.158 --> 04:16.423
and that's about all I know.

04:17.762 --> 04:19.889
NARRA TOR: Five days after his arrival,

04:20.298 --> 04:21.697
he was dead.

04:28.607 --> 04:30.438
CURTIS: I would say this was around...

04:31.076 --> 04:33.567
About 0500 in the morning,

04:33.945 --> 04:37.904
and as I walk by Dilawar...
I think that's his name, Dilawar.

04:37.983 --> 04:39.644
I walked by Dilawar's cell,

04:39.718 --> 04:43.279
[noticed he was just kind ofhanging there
with his head down

04:43.355 --> 04:49.089
but he was being too still to be, you know,
just hanging there and sleeping.

04:49.561 --> 04:52.826
Sgt. Curtis opened up the door
and we went in,

04:53.431 --> 04:54.693
and he was unresponsive.

04:54.766 --> 04:56.233
We started CPR.

04:57.135 --> 04:59.399
BRAND: l was downstairs
in general population,

04:59.471 --> 05:03.066
then I heard a call come in
asking for Cammack to come upstairs.

05:03.441 --> 05:07.036
He was a medic. And we carried him
downstairs on a stretcher,

05:07.112 --> 05:10.013
and Cammack was still on top of him
while we were carrying him down,

05:10.081 --> 05:13.346
still trying to get him back going,
all the way down the stairs.

05:13.418 --> 05:14.942
Got him through the front door,

05:15.020 --> 05:16.988
and they kept working on him
and kept working on him

05:17.055 --> 05:19.717
until the doctor got there
and pronounced him dead.

05:21.559 --> 05:25.290
CURTIS: I don't know whether it was
an injury that was aggravated by something,

05:25.363 --> 05:28.423
or whether he was just sick coming in.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.027
They are very frail people,
and l was surprised

05:32.103 --> 05:36.369
that it had taken that long
for one ofthem to die in our custody.

05:36.441 --> 05:39.069
There was a definite sense of concern,

05:39.144 --> 05:40.702
because he was the second one.

05:41.446 --> 05:46.349
NARRA TOR: Just a week before Dilawar's
death, another detainee at Bagram had died.

05:46.418 --> 05:49.148
You know, you wonder,
is it something we did,

05:49.220 --> 05:52.553
or did somebody kill him or something,
but I just didn't know.

05:52.624 --> 05:54.888
NARRA TOR: According to
the medical examiner,

05:54.960 --> 06:00.091
the first detainee to die, Habibullah,
had a preexisting pulmonary condition.

06:00.165 --> 06:02.895
But it was the beatings
he sustained at Bagram

06:02.968 --> 06:05.300
that led to the cause ofhis death.’

06:05.370 --> 06:08.305
a blood clot that traveled to his lungs.

06:08.573 --> 06:12.168
When the second one died a week later,
that's when it was like, "Oh, crap.

06:12.243 --> 06:13.608
"Something's gonna happen now."

06:13.678 --> 06:17.011
You know, that's two prisoners dying
within a week of each other.

06:17.082 --> 06:18.242
That's bad.

06:18.984 --> 06:22.078
NARRA TOR: A preliminary investigation
into Dilawar's death

06:22.153 --> 06:25.714
revealed deep bruises all over his body,

06:25.790 --> 06:29.954
but did not conclude
that his treatment at Bagram was to blame.

06:30.028 --> 06:34.988
The next day, they said, "Just draw out
how he was shackled up here,"

06:35.066 --> 06:37.762
and I made that little crude drawing.

06:38.970 --> 06:43.873
The ceiling of these isolation rooms
was just a simple metal grate,

06:44.009 --> 06:46.443
and it was thick enough
you could put handcuffs,

06:46.511 --> 06:48.911
you know, through the wires of that,

06:48.980 --> 06:51.574
and you just kind of
chained them up like that,

06:51.649 --> 06:53.207
out to the sides like this.

06:56.254 --> 06:58.279
NARRA TOR: Forced standing
for long periods

06:58.356 --> 07:02.019
had inflamed tissue damage
from blows to Dilawar's legs.

07:02.894 --> 07:07.854
But the initial Bagram press release failed
to mention overhead shackling or beatings.

07:07.932 --> 07:12.665
lt declared that both detainees had died
”of natural causes. ”

07:18.510 --> 07:24.039
My opinion is
that the military wanted to get this over

07:24.115 --> 07:27.607
and get this done quickly
before it really got noticed.

07:29.854 --> 07:31.879
NARRA TOR: Soon after Dilawar's death,

07:31.956 --> 07:35.915
the officer in charge of interrogation
at Bagram, Captain Carolyn Wood,

07:36.494 --> 07:39.054
was awarded the Bronze Star for valor.

07:40.432 --> 07:44.095
Following the Iraq invasion,
Wood and her intelligence unit

07:44.169 --> 07:46.330
were given a new assignment:

07:47.138 --> 07:48.503
Abu Ghraib.

08:02.654 --> 08:06.681
LAHAMMER.’ The only thing I can really
remember about Abu Ghraib was the heat.

08:06.758 --> 08:10.854
It was, like, 148 degrees or so there,
and it was all concrete.

08:11.763 --> 08:15.392
You know, Abu Ghraib also had the
infamous torture chambers and stuff

08:15.467 --> 08:18.027
left from Saddam 's era.

08:18.103 --> 08:22.233
I remember walking through those and
seeing, like, fingernail marks on the walls

08:22.307 --> 08:25.970
and blood stains and guillotines
and stuff like that.

08:26.044 --> 08:28.274
It was a pretty surreal feeling.

08:30.048 --> 08:33.108
We went to Abu Ghraib, lbelieve, in July,

08:33.485 --> 08:37.444
July, August of 2003, to start the prison.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.260
You put people in a crazy situation,
and people do crazy things.

08:44.095 --> 08:45.255
(EXPLOSION)

08:45.330 --> 08:47.423
And Abu was getting mortared every night,

08:47.499 --> 08:50.593
these 120-millimeter mortars
killing prisoners.

08:50.668 --> 08:51.999
The first time that happened,

08:52.070 --> 08:55.699
they should have evacuated
those prisoners to somewhere else,

08:55.773 --> 08:58.264
because the prisoners weren't safe.

08:58.943 --> 09:02.777
DAVIS: People were being told
to rough up Iraqis that wouldn't cooperate.

09:02.847 --> 09:05.816
We were also told they're nothing but dogs.

09:06.451 --> 09:10.319
Then all of a sudden, you start looking
at these people as less than human,

09:10.388 --> 09:13.221
and you start doing things to them
you would never dream of.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.657
And that's where it got scary.

09:23.601 --> 09:24.932
It was only the night shift.

09:25.003 --> 09:26.231
There's always a few bad apples.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.431
It's been a body blow for all of us.

09:28.506 --> 09:31.407
This was clearly an isolated incident.

09:31.476 --> 09:36.072
...the conduct of a very, very small number
of our leaders and soldiers.

09:38.116 --> 09:41.244
NARRATOR.’ In the wake ofmedia attention
surrounding Abu Ghraib,

09:41.319 --> 09:44.083
the military began a series of investigations.

09:44.155 --> 09:47.386
The people who engaged in abuses
will be brought to justice.

09:48.193 --> 09:52.391
The world will see how a free system,
a democratic system,

09:52.463 --> 09:56.729
functions and operates transparently,
with no cover-ups...

09:57.902 --> 09:59.460
HUTSON.’ The Secretary and other have said,

09:59.537 --> 10:02.233
”Well, you know, we've
conducted 12 investigations, ”

10:02.307 --> 10:06.505
each and all of which were geared
to looking downward,

10:06.578 --> 10:08.910
down toward Lynndie England and Graner,

10:09.180 --> 10:10.943
and not looking up.

10:14.252 --> 10:18.746
NARRA TOR: The soldiers in the photos
are Military Police, or MPs,

10:18.823 --> 10:22.190
whose job it was to guard
and protect the prisoners.

10:23.027 --> 10:27.430
In their statements, the MPs claimed
that Military Intelligence, or Ml,

10:27.498 --> 10:31.229
ordered them to weaken, humiliate
and break the prisoners

10:31.302 --> 10:33.361
for interrogation purposes.

10:33.438 --> 10:36.134
LAGOURANIS.’ Obviously, you know,
what they were doing in those pictures

10:36.207 --> 10:39.233
was not sanctioned
by the Interrogation Rules of Engagement,

10:39.310 --> 10:41.005
and they weren't interrogators.

10:41.079 --> 10:43.047
So, yes, I did think
that they were bad apples.

10:43.648 --> 10:47.641
However, [also think that they were
taking cues from Intel.

10:48.753 --> 10:51.415
Just reading reports,
it was happening in Afghanistan.

10:51.489 --> 10:55.550
I mean, humiliation, trying to break people,
came from somewhere.

10:55.627 --> 11:00.360
MPs didn't think of it.
MPs were not ever trained in such things.

11:00.431 --> 11:03.423
We should never have been
breaking anybody.

11:04.435 --> 11:08.166
I can tell you, we set the same policy at Abu
that we set at Bagram.

11:08.239 --> 11:10.070
Same exact rules.

11:11.476 --> 11:13.603
The same thing was going on.

11:16.147 --> 11:18.445
And they wonder why it happened.

11:21.853 --> 11:24.686
NARRATOR.’ In her sworn testimony
about Abu Ghraib,

11:24.756 --> 11:28.419
Captain Wood said she felt pressure
to produce intelligence,

11:28.660 --> 11:30.753
so she brought unauthorized techniques,

11:30.828 --> 11:34.355
dogs, nudity,
sleep deprivation and ”stress positions, ”

11:34.432 --> 11:36.832
to Abu Ghraib from Afghanistan,

11:37.669 --> 11:42.629
Wood maintained that the Bagram model
had tacit approval from superiors.

11:42.707 --> 11:45.039
But U.S. Central Command
had never responded

11:45.109 --> 11:47.976
to her requests for authorization.

11:48.046 --> 11:49.946
So the mystery remained.

11:50.014 --> 11:53.211
Was Abu Ghraib the work
of a few bad apples,

11:53.284 --> 11:57.983
or evidence of a new worldwide system
of detention and interrogation?

11:59.691 --> 12:02.558
LAGOURANIS.’ I'm pretty sure
that interrogators were telling the guards,

12:02.627 --> 12:04.117
”Strip this guy naked,

12:04.195 --> 12:06.527
”chain him up to the bed
in an uncomfortable position, ”

12:06.597 --> 12:08.497
you know, "do whatever you can,"
and then, you know,

12:08.566 --> 12:12.161
they just decided to take it one step further
and have some fun with...

12:12.236 --> 12:13.828
And take pictures.

13:01.486 --> 13:03.545
WILKERSON.’ You've always got people
in the military

13:03.621 --> 13:06.647
who are just this side
of the Marquis de Sade,

13:06.724 --> 13:10.785
and one of the reasons you want rules
and this code ofconduct

13:10.862 --> 13:15.663
to help you lead mud Marines,
mud grunts, infantrymen,

13:15.733 --> 13:22.195
is so that you can use those tools
to restrict this tendency in your soldiers.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.067
(EXPLOSION)

13:24.142 --> 13:27.077
When you have your friends dying
on your left and right,

13:27.145 --> 13:29.739
you can sometimes go beyond the pale.

13:30.415 --> 13:33.748
So a lieutenant, a captain,
down where the rubber meets the road

13:33.818 --> 13:35.376
needs these tools,

13:35.553 --> 13:38.545
and he needs to be able
to punish people who cross the line.

13:46.497 --> 13:50.194
When the Secretary walked through my door
into my office

13:50.268 --> 13:53.669
about the time the photos ofAbu Ghraib
were getting ready to come out,

13:53.738 --> 13:56.332
and we had rumor
that they were coming out,

13:56.407 --> 13:59.899
he said to me, ”I need to know
what happened and why. ”

13:59.977 --> 14:02.707
And so then [began to build
both an open source

14:02.780 --> 14:07.183
and an inside-the-government
classified and unclassified document file,

14:07.251 --> 14:10.311
and I began to see legal arguments
as to why the President

14:10.388 --> 14:13.619
could pretty much do anything he wanted to
in the name ofsecurity.

14:13.691 --> 14:16.285
And the Secretary of Defense
and others beneath him

14:16.360 --> 14:21.696
were actually looking for
the twin pressures that they put on people.

14:21.933 --> 14:24.367
That is to say,
the pressure to produce intelligence,

14:24.535 --> 14:27.834
and the fact that they were saying,
”The gloves are off, ”

14:27.905 --> 14:29.964
created the environment in the field

14:30.041 --> 14:33.238
that we later saw reflected
in the photographs from Abu Ghraib

14:33.311 --> 14:34.972
and, in my view,

14:35.046 --> 14:39.540
a far more serious fashion
than the photographs we saw.

14:39.617 --> 14:43.951
Ninety-eight deaths of people in detention,

14:44.021 --> 14:46.285
which I understand now,
from my Army colleagues,

14:46.357 --> 14:52.262
is up to some 25 of which had been declared
officially by the Army as homicides.

14:54.131 --> 14:58.090
People say, "Well, these photographs
from Abu Ghraib, they weren't real torture."

14:58.169 --> 15:01.036
I look back at those people and I say,
"Murder is torture.

15:01.105 --> 15:03.164
"Murder is the ultimate torture."

15:04.275 --> 15:10.180
In the case of Dilawar, he was subjected to,
certainly, cruel and unusual punishment,

15:10.248 --> 15:14.446
and ultimately he was subjected to torture,
because he died.

15:49.186 --> 15:51.711
"First, we're not chaining people
to the ceiling."

15:51.789 --> 15:53.620
That's what he says.

15:53.691 --> 15:57.821
NARRA TOR: Carlotta Gall is
a New York Times journalist based in Kabul.

15:57.895 --> 16:02.161
Unsatisfied with the military's explanation
of the two deaths at Bagram,

16:02.233 --> 16:04.326
she set out to investigate.

16:11.475 --> 16:13.670
GALL.’ It took along time to find the family,

16:13.744 --> 16:16.144
because the military
didn't tell us who they were,

16:16.213 --> 16:20.149
and we started calling around governors.

16:20.217 --> 16:23.584
They're a very simple farming family,
they don't speak English,

16:23.654 --> 16:27.988
but they showed me a paper
that was given to them with the body.

16:28.059 --> 16:31.495
And that's when I opened it up and read it,
and it was in English,

16:31.562 --> 16:35.089
and it was a death certificate
from the American military.

16:35.166 --> 16:39.728
And it was signed by a U.S. major,
who was the pathologist,

16:40.104 --> 16:43.301
and there were four boxes,
and she'd ticked the box for homicide.

16:45.142 --> 16:46.609
I said, "My God, they've killed him."

16:46.677 --> 16:51.376
And we then had to tell the family,
"Do you know what's written here?"

16:51.449 --> 16:54.316
And they said, "No, it's in English.
We don't understand."

16:54.385 --> 16:58.481
And I think maybe the Red Cross, who
helped return the body, had explained,

16:58.556 --> 17:00.717
but they hadn't taken it in.

17:01.292 --> 17:04.193
And then the pathologist had said
it was this blunt force trauma to the legs

17:04.261 --> 17:05.285
(GALL READING)

17:07.965 --> 17:08.989
(GALL ON RECORDING)

17:14.672 --> 17:15.730
(McNEILL ON RECORDING)

17:22.480 --> 17:25.677
"Presently, l have no indication ofthat."

17:25.750 --> 17:30.915
You know, there's been a death certificate
signed by his people, and he says,

17:31.889 --> 17:34.357
"Presently, l have no indication
of any blunt force trauma."

17:34.425 --> 17:37.553
And it's written on the death certificate,
which I've seen.

17:37.628 --> 17:38.993
GOLDEN: This story probably would
have gone away

17:39.063 --> 17:41.725
had it not been for my colleague,
Carlotta Gall,

17:41.799 --> 17:47.795
who tracked down Dilawar's family
and found the knife-in-the-back clue

17:47.872 --> 17:50.739
that told everyone that this incident

17:50.808 --> 17:53.572
had been something other
than the military portrayed.

17:55.946 --> 17:57.880
NARRATOR.’ Tim Golden picked up
the trail of the story

17:57.948 --> 18:01.543
and obtained a confidential file
of the Army investigation,

18:01.619 --> 18:04.952
including hundreds ofpages of testimony
from the soldiers involved.

18:06.257 --> 18:08.054
GOLDEN: Part of what made
the story compelling to me

18:08.125 --> 18:10.355
was that you had these young soldiers

18:10.428 --> 18:11.986
with very little training or preparation

18:12.063 --> 18:15.294
thrown into this situation
in the aftermath of 9/11,

18:15.366 --> 18:17.163
just as the rules were changing.

18:17.234 --> 18:19.828
And they weren't told
what the new rules were.

18:19.904 --> 18:23.340
Then you had this young Afghan man
who came into this system

18:23.407 --> 18:27.707
at the wrong time and in the wrong way,
and this is what happened to him.

18:28.112 --> 18:31.013
CURTIS: [saw his picture
in a New York Times article.

18:31.082 --> 18:35.280
Before that picture, I couldn't have
picked his face out, you know?

18:35.352 --> 18:40.221
My memory of him was chained up
with a hood on, no sleeping.

18:41.926 --> 18:44.895
NARRA TOR: Following questions raised
by The New York Times,

18:44.962 --> 18:47.795
and under scrutiny
from the Abu Ghraib scandal,

18:47.865 --> 18:51.392
the Army finally stepped up
the Dilawar investigation

18:51.469 --> 18:55.803
and began charging soldiers
with maltreatment, maiming

18:56.540 --> 18:57.598
and homicide.

18:57.675 --> 19:00.940
CURTIS: When you're working, you know,
with an organization like the military,

19:01.011 --> 19:03.036
you know, they're gonna hold
somebody accountable.

19:03.114 --> 19:04.775
You can sweep some things under the rug,

19:04.849 --> 19:07.909
but this was a death. It was two deaths.

19:07.985 --> 19:09.850
And okay, fine,
they're gonna charge people.

19:09.920 --> 19:13.947
It seemed like the military now,
after they got a black eye from Abu Ghraib,

19:14.024 --> 19:18.461
wanted to get a public opinion
that they were policing their soldiers.

19:19.497 --> 19:23.524
So they said, "We have this incident
that happened a couple of years ago.

19:23.601 --> 19:26.365
”We could still prosecute some of them. ”

19:26.704 --> 19:28.865
I had nothing to do with the military
for two years,

19:28.939 --> 19:32.602
and all of a sudden I'm getting a call
saying that I'm being court marshaled.

19:32.676 --> 19:33.700
I mean, that was a huge surprise for me.

19:35.579 --> 19:36.705
From the defense perspective,

19:36.781 --> 19:39.511
I immediately said,
"This is a political show trial."

19:40.251 --> 19:43.948
Willie Brand is a good soldier.
Good soldiers tend to obey orders,

19:44.021 --> 19:48.321
good soldiers tend to be people
who do what they're trained to do.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.724
GOLDEN: The interrogators on the ground,

19:51.796 --> 19:53.889
for the most part,
didn't know what the rules were.

19:54.098 --> 19:55.827
They'd never been interrogators before.

19:56.634 --> 20:00.331
CORSETTI: My interrogation training
consisted of...

20:00.404 --> 20:05.034
Basically, they taught us some approaches,
how to get people to talk.

20:05.109 --> 20:09.273
And then, "Here, go.
Go watch these guys interrogate,"

20:09.346 --> 20:11.974
which were the people
that we were replacing,

20:12.049 --> 20:16.452
for about five, siX hours
before I did my first interrogation.

20:16.954 --> 20:20.685
Damien was picked for this job
because he's big, he's loud,

20:20.758 --> 20:21.850
and he's scary.

20:22.126 --> 20:24.060
That was his qualification.

20:24.128 --> 20:26.995
"Soldiers are dying. Get the information."

20:27.064 --> 20:29.259
That's all you're told. "Get the information."

20:30.968 --> 20:34.927
GOLDEN: Soldiers said that when prisoners
like Dilawar came into Bagram,

20:35.005 --> 20:36.996
they were immediately assaulted.

20:37.074 --> 20:38.098
(LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

20:39.710 --> 20:44.841
GOLDEN: They blasted music at them,
often they had dogs barking at them,

20:44.949 --> 20:49.409
and they would use
some of the most menacing interrogators

20:49.486 --> 20:52.387
to create this sense of threat.

20:52.456 --> 20:55.118
One of those was Damien Corsetti.

20:55.192 --> 20:58.355
With the screaming, you're trying to instill
what's called shock of capture.

20:58.429 --> 21:01.990
When the person first comes in, that's when
they're most apt to give you information,

21:02.066 --> 21:04.899
because they're just like,
"Oh, crap, what's going on?"

21:04.969 --> 21:06.766
BEGG.’ It's notjust
a disorientation procedure,

21:06.837 --> 21:08.862
it's actually a terrorizing procedure.

21:08.939 --> 21:12.773
It's designed to terrify you
into spilling the beans, as it were.

21:12.843 --> 21:15.971
Being spat at, being sworn at,
having the dogs barking around,

21:16.046 --> 21:17.775
cameras flashing in your face.

21:17.848 --> 21:22.012
CURTIS: Keep in mind, in their culture,
that dog's more shocking to them

21:22.086 --> 21:23.144
than it is to us.

21:23.220 --> 21:26.621
Kind oflike a woman telling them
what to do. You know, it's a cultural thing.

21:26.957 --> 21:29.858
So you get more bang for your buck
over there with a dog.

21:29.927 --> 21:32.054
And then to be re-shackled
completely naked

21:32.129 --> 21:37.089
and to do what they call the body search,
the cavity search,

21:37.968 --> 21:40.801
and then to be questioned,
naked, shivering...

21:44.208 --> 21:47.075
BRAND: After they're read their rules
and everything, they're taken to their cell

21:47.144 --> 21:50.375
to where they're gonna be put
in sleep deprivation for 24 hours.

21:50.447 --> 21:52.381
That's standard for everybody.

21:52.449 --> 21:53.973
From there, MI direct us

21:54.051 --> 21:57.714
ifthey can go to general population
or ifthey have to stay in isolation,

21:57.788 --> 22:00.951
and ifthey are gonna stay in isolation,
if they're gonna be allowed to sleep,

22:01.025 --> 22:02.652
and ifthey can, then when.

22:02.726 --> 22:04.887
NARRATOR.’ To weaken the defenses
of detainees,

22:04.962 --> 22:09.865
interrogators ordered Military Police
to find ways ofkeeping the prisoners awake.

22:09.934 --> 22:12.767
You know, you're in that room
not saying anything,

22:12.836 --> 22:15.327
"You know,
maybe he knows a little bit more.

22:15.406 --> 22:18.204
"Let's let him lose a little bit more sleep,"

22:18.275 --> 22:22.974
which is the idea of keeping you like this,
so you won't sleep, you'll stand.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.810
Because as soon as you start
to let your body go,

22:25.883 --> 22:28.010
all that pressure
on your wrists and your arms,

22:28.085 --> 22:31.020
you're gonna feel that with those cuffs on.

22:31.989 --> 22:34.890
The only time the MP5
would ever help us do anything

22:34.959 --> 22:37.393
would be to keep them on a sleep schedule.

22:37.461 --> 22:39.429
You know,
they're guaranteed so much sleep.

22:39.496 --> 22:42.431
Is that sleep consistent?
Is it uninterrupted?

22:43.133 --> 22:46.933
You know, is it 15 minutes here,
15 minutes there? Who knows? And that's...

22:48.005 --> 22:50.098
That's how it was proposed to us.

22:51.175 --> 22:54.736
CURTIS: There'd be a board
when you walk in the room, on this wall.

22:54.812 --> 22:58.407
You might see an arrow going up
to the ceiling.

22:58.482 --> 23:01.940
And there would be maybe a "1" by it.

23:02.019 --> 23:05.250
So that'd be an hour up.
He's got to stand up for an hour.

23:05.322 --> 23:09.053
And then you may see a ”2"
with an arrow pointing down.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.594
That means he can sit down for two hours.

23:12.062 --> 23:14.929
GOLDEN: The prisoners were kept
in these big pens downstairs,

23:14.999 --> 23:19.129
and their numbers would be scribbled
on the door of the airlock,

23:19.203 --> 23:21.967
which was the little passageway
that they were taken out of

23:22.039 --> 23:25.372
when they were brought up
to the isolation cells upstairs.

23:26.043 --> 23:29.604
Detainees were actually chained
with their hands above their heads

23:29.680 --> 23:31.113
in these airlocks.

23:31.215 --> 23:34.412
His number, 421,
was something that I could see often,

23:34.485 --> 23:36.350
because his back was towards me
in the airlock

23:36.420 --> 23:39.548
and the numbers were written on the backs
ofthe detainees in black marker.

23:40.024 --> 23:42.185
And we all had that. As well as on the front.

23:42.259 --> 23:43.521
INTERVIEWER: What was your number?

23:43.594 --> 23:48.088
My number in Bagram was 180,
but later it became 558.

23:50.067 --> 23:53.867
Thank you. It's great to be with you.
It's good to be here in Bagram, ofcourse.

23:54.071 --> 23:56.699
CURTIS: I'm sure
any high-ranking officer who toured

23:56.774 --> 23:58.674
would see the shackles.

23:59.009 --> 24:00.738
Because you're gonna tour to look.

24:01.078 --> 24:03.808
You know,
they're curious just like everybody else is.

24:03.881 --> 24:08.215
CORSETTI: There were always officers
coming and going through the facility.

24:08.285 --> 24:11.345
We kind ofjoked about it
as being ”the greatest show on earth. ”

24:11.422 --> 24:14.585
Everyone wanted to come
and look at the terrorists.

24:14.658 --> 24:18.754
Mr. Rumsfeld's office
called our office frequently.

24:19.630 --> 24:22.497
Very high commanders
would want to be kept up to date

24:22.566 --> 24:25.228
on a daily basis on certain prisoners there.

24:26.070 --> 24:29.301
The brass knew. They saw them shackled,
they saw them hooded,

24:29.373 --> 24:31.705
and they said,
"Right on, y'all are doing a great job."

24:32.910 --> 24:35.140
NARRATOR.’ When the Red Cross
toured Bagram,

24:35.212 --> 24:39.649
the sleep deprivation chart was erased
and the prisoners were unshackled.

24:40.651 --> 24:43.313
Traditional military procedure
did not allow you

24:43.387 --> 24:46.220
to shackle somebody to a fixed object.

24:46.290 --> 24:49.123
Certainly not chaining their arms overhead.

24:49.993 --> 24:56.398
Initially, they were handcuffing people
into the airlock of the cells for punishment.

24:56.467 --> 25:00.563
And that was to be strictly limited.
Fifteen minutes, half an hour.

25:00.838 --> 25:04.330
But it quickly evolved.
And when you walked in there,

25:04.408 --> 25:08.037
theyjust had a pair of long handcuffs

25:08.112 --> 25:11.240
dangling from the wire mesh ceiling
ofthe cell,

25:11.648 --> 25:13.673
ready for whoever came in.

25:29.366 --> 25:31.766
NARRA TOR: The Army coroner
who examined Dilawar

25:31.835 --> 25:34.998
discovered massive tissue damage
in his legs.

25:35.072 --> 25:40.339
She later testified
that his legs had ”been pulpified.”

25:40.711 --> 25:43.407
But what could have caused
that kind ofdamage?

25:43.680 --> 25:45.170
(HAYDEN ON TAPE)

25:49.987 --> 25:54.253
NARRATOR.’ In a videotape that surfaced
as part of the homicide investigation,

25:54.324 --> 25:59.057
Colonel David Hayden, a top Army lawyer
for U. S. forces in Afghanistan,

25:59.129 --> 26:03.088
described a policy of shackling
and striking detainees.

26:12.743 --> 26:16.679
I didn't actually hear a higher-up saying,
"Go and kick him in the leg,

26:16.747 --> 26:19.477
”if they do this, or do that. ”
The higher-ups said,

26:19.550 --> 26:24.487
"In order to get control ofthem,
that's an option which you can use."

26:24.555 --> 26:30.152
It's just your knee going into the side
oftheir thigh, about midway up.

26:30.227 --> 26:35.529
There's supposed to be a pressure point
right there, and it controls them really easy.

26:41.972 --> 26:45.533
Throughout the investigation,
and even in the trials,

26:45.609 --> 26:48.840
a lot of the guards and interrogators
described Dilawar

26:48.912 --> 26:53.542
as a very combative detainee,
as a tough character.

26:53.617 --> 26:56.643
And that's just never been reconciled

26:56.720 --> 27:00.178
with all the other evidence
that there was about this guy.

27:00.257 --> 27:02.782
He weighed 122 pounds when he died.

27:03.927 --> 27:07.693
The men who had been passengers
in Dilawar's taxi told us later

27:07.764 --> 27:10.733
that he hadjust been absolutely terrified
at Bagram,

27:10.801 --> 27:14.498
that they heard him through the walls
of the isolation cells,

27:14.571 --> 27:17.165
screaming for his mother and father.

27:19.443 --> 27:21.775
He'd be in a very uncomfortable position,

27:21.845 --> 27:25.372
muttering things, sometimes praying,
sometimes asking for help.

27:25.449 --> 27:29.385
Or seemingly asking for help,
because I couldn't understand his language.

27:30.554 --> 27:34.752
NARRA TOR: A number of witnesses
remember the night before Dilawar died.

27:34.825 --> 27:38.784
CURTIS: Well, just that one night,
he got kicked in the leg maybe 10 times.

27:38.862 --> 27:41.262
GOLDEN: Some of the soldiers said
they started using the knee strikes

27:41.331 --> 27:44.823
essentially to shut him up,
because he was yelling and screaming.

27:44.901 --> 27:46.869
The damage that was done

27:46.937 --> 27:48.837
was done from multiple strikes

27:49.172 --> 27:51.606
and a lot of that could have been avoided

27:51.675 --> 27:54.576
had you known the person before you
had fought with him

27:54.645 --> 27:56.909
and used that exact technique.

27:58.448 --> 28:01.679
BEGG.’ When they eventually came
to take him to an isolation cell,

28:01.752 --> 28:04.516
I believe his body had become almost limp.

28:04.588 --> 28:06.886
One of the reasons
why they began punching him

28:06.957 --> 28:10.222
was that they felt that he was putting it on.

28:10.294 --> 28:14.663
He was in the airlock,
standing there with a hood over his head.

28:14.731 --> 28:19.191
He had his hands tied above his head,
and he was moaning.

28:19.870 --> 28:22.896
MORDEN.’ He just started to fight,
right there in the airlock.

28:22.973 --> 28:25.737
And the airlock has a front gate
and a back gate,

28:25.809 --> 28:29.074
but both the sides are concertina wire.

28:29.146 --> 28:33.139
Neither of us officers wanted
to get into the concertina wire,

28:33.216 --> 28:36.549
so we pulled him out ofthe airlock
and put him on the floor

28:36.620 --> 28:38.588
and put him into restraints.

28:38.655 --> 28:41.715
INTERVIEWER: What kind of force did you
have to use in order to subdue him?

28:41.792 --> 28:44.124
Physical force. He was struck.

28:44.895 --> 28:46.954
There was, like, four MP5 on this guy,

28:47.030 --> 28:51.865
and one ofthe MPs
just kept giving him kidney shots.

28:52.169 --> 28:55.661
The other two,
they'd slammed him to the ground,

28:55.739 --> 28:59.266
and then the fourth one, like,
jumped on his back.

28:59.343 --> 29:02.540
He got a big gash on his nose.

29:02.612 --> 29:06.241
There was no reason to hit him.
Let's remember he's shackled.

29:06.316 --> 29:08.477
Even when control wasn't an issue,

29:08.552 --> 29:11.817
it became, "Well I'm just gonna do this
to get mine in."

29:11.888 --> 29:14.152
And that's probably why they got in trouble,

29:14.224 --> 29:19.184
because you really couldn't justify
kicking a guy that much

29:19.262 --> 29:21.287
if he was just chained up.

29:22.399 --> 29:24.663
NARRA TOR: Dilawar was taken
to an isolation cell,

29:24.735 --> 29:26.896
where the knee strikes continued.

29:28.138 --> 29:31.005
In her statement at trial,
the Army coroner said

29:31.074 --> 29:35.306
his lower limbs looked like
they had been run over by a bus.

29:35.379 --> 29:40.078
Had he lived, it would've been necessary
to amputate his legs.

29:40.717 --> 29:43.652
Then it kind of raised the question of, like,
"This is what we did to him."

29:43.720 --> 29:45.847
It's not just like, "This is what I did to him,"

29:45.922 --> 29:49.187
or, "This is what Cammack did to him,"
or Morden or anybody.

29:49.259 --> 29:51.819
It's just, "This is what we've done."

29:53.897 --> 29:58.163
GOLDEN: It's almost hard to fathom now.
You had soldiers like Willie Brand,

29:58.235 --> 30:01.762
who seems like this very gentle,
kind ofsoft-spoken guy,

30:01.838 --> 30:06.104
but who testified that he struck Dilawar
so many times in the leg

30:06.176 --> 30:09.612
that his knee got tired
and he had to switch to the other one.

30:10.947 --> 30:13.472
Sometimes I feel that I should've

30:15.285 --> 30:19.312
gone with my own morality,

30:19.956 --> 30:22.254
more than what was common.

30:25.128 --> 30:28.495
NARRA TOR: One MP testified
that the strikes became an amusement,

30:28.565 --> 30:32.160
inflicted on Dilawar
just to hear him scream, ”Allah. ”

30:32.235 --> 30:33.259
CURTIS: Some would say,

30:33.336 --> 30:35.361
”Well, hey, you should've stopped this.
You should've stopped that

30:35.439 --> 30:38.567
"when you saw he was injured
or saw he was being kicked on needlessly,

30:38.642 --> 30:40.337
"why didn't you do something?"

30:40.410 --> 30:42.708
That'd be a good question.
My answer would be,

30:42.779 --> 30:45.077
"Well, you know, it was us against them."
I was over there,

30:45.148 --> 30:49.107
I didn't wanna appear to be
going against my fellow soldiers.

30:51.988 --> 30:55.651
Is that wrong? You could sit here
and say that was dead wrong.

30:55.725 --> 30:57.852
Go over there and say that.

31:01.631 --> 31:05.226
NARRA TOR: No one ever investigated
who set the rules at Bagram.

31:05.302 --> 31:06.326
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

31:06.403 --> 31:11.170
Investigators never asked Captain Wood
what senior officers had given orders

31:11.241 --> 31:13.937
to treat detainees
in ways that were forbidden

31:14.010 --> 31:16.535
according to the Army field manual.

31:17.214 --> 31:21.150
MP Captain Beiring was the only officer
prosecuted in the case.

31:22.152 --> 31:25.053
His dereliction of duty charge
was dismissed

31:25.155 --> 31:30.183
when the judge determined that no one had
made clear what Captain Beiring's duty was.

31:31.595 --> 31:34.257
In spite of repeated requests
for proper training

31:34.331 --> 31:36.526
and rules of engagement for his soldiers,

31:36.600 --> 31:38.864
his superiors gave him neither.

31:39.169 --> 31:42.570
We were all worried
about not having that written guidelines,

31:42.672 --> 31:44.401
but they kept reassuring us
that it was coming.

31:46.743 --> 31:49.007
We knew exactly why
we weren't getting clear guidance:

31:49.446 --> 31:51.676
just in case something like this happened.

31:52.482 --> 31:55.974
lfl had to do it again,
I'd probably say, "No." Just...

31:56.453 --> 32:00.856
I'd be like, "I'm not doing anything
until I see something in writing."

32:01.892 --> 32:03.359
INTERVIEWER: And do you think...

32:03.460 --> 32:05.928
I mean, looking back,
do you think you were misled?

32:08.431 --> 32:10.456
I think we all were.

32:40.030 --> 32:42.191
NARRA TOR: A week after September 11,

32:43.233 --> 32:46.498
Vice President Dick Cheney
appeared on Meet the Press

32:47.203 --> 32:51.503
to describe how interrogation policies
were about to change.

32:54.077 --> 32:56.671
We have to work sort of the dark side,
if you will.

32:56.746 --> 33:00.477
We've got to spend time in the shadows
in the intelligence world.

33:00.550 --> 33:04.008
A lot of what needs to be done here
will have to be done quietly,

33:04.087 --> 33:06.578
without any discussion,
using sources and methods

33:06.656 --> 33:09.591
that are available
to our intelligence agencies,

33:09.659 --> 33:11.217
if we're going to be successful.

33:11.294 --> 33:13.762
That's the world these folks operate in,

33:13.830 --> 33:18.460
and so it's going to be vital for us to use
any means at our disposal, basically,

33:18.535 --> 33:20.526
to achieve our objective.

33:21.504 --> 33:25.531
HORTON: It's very clear that it starts
in the office of Vice President Cheney.

33:25.609 --> 33:28.169
He had a very strong view

33:28.244 --> 33:33.204
that we were not as aggressive
in dealing with people in interrogations

33:33.283 --> 33:35.843
as we could or should be.

33:37.187 --> 33:40.520
Taking the gloves off,
being rough with detainees.

33:41.324 --> 33:44.782
NARRA TOR: If Dick Cheney was
the primary architect of a new policy,

33:44.861 --> 33:46.522
John Yoo was the chief draftsman.

33:47.731 --> 33:51.394
He wrote guiding opinions
which argued for a flexible approach

33:51.468 --> 33:53.766
to treating suspected terrorists.

33:53.837 --> 33:57.364
The United States used to treat terrorism
as a criminal justice problem.

33:57.874 --> 34:00.741
The September 11 attack showed
that the struggle with Al-Qaeda

34:00.810 --> 34:02.505
had moved into warfare.

34:02.579 --> 34:05.742
And I think when a foreign entity,
for political purposes,

34:05.815 --> 34:09.717
can kill 3,000 Americans,
cause billions ofdollars ofdamage

34:09.786 --> 34:13.745
and try to eliminate the leaders
of the American government,

34:13.823 --> 34:16.587
that sounds like war to most people.
It doesn't sound like crime.

34:17.627 --> 34:20.528
NARRA TOR: President Bush declared
a war on terror.

34:20.830 --> 34:23.856
But he raised questions
about whether suspected terrorists

34:23.933 --> 34:26.493
should be protected by the laws of war,

34:26.569 --> 34:29.037
the Geneva Conventions.

34:30.507 --> 34:32.702
Atrocities that shocked
the conscience of the world

34:32.776 --> 34:35.677
gave rise to the modern
Geneva Conventions,

34:35.745 --> 34:39.112
international treaties meant
to provide fundamental protections

34:39.182 --> 34:42.151
for every human being captured in wartime.

34:44.487 --> 34:48.583
In effect for over 50 years,
Geneva offered legal protections

34:48.658 --> 34:52.856
and prohibited interrogators
from using torture, murder,

34:52.929 --> 34:55.864
or even humiliating
and degrading treatment.

34:57.434 --> 35:00.926
After 9/11, John Yoo worked closely
with Dick Cheney's office

35:01.004 --> 35:04.872
and Alberto Gonzales,
the Counsel to the President.

35:04.941 --> 35:06.636
They wrote a series of memos

35:06.710 --> 35:11.374
arguing that the Geneva Conventions
did not apply to suspected terrorists.

35:12.315 --> 35:16.217
And they gave legal cover
for the CIA and Special Forces

35:16.286 --> 35:18.686
to embark on a secret program

35:18.755 --> 35:22.418
of previously forbidden
interrogation techniques.

35:22.492 --> 35:26.155
BUSH: More than 3,000 suspected terrorists
have been arrested in many countries.

35:26.529 --> 35:28.861
Many others have met a different fate.

35:29.632 --> 35:31.156
Let's put it this way:

35:31.234 --> 35:33.202
They're no longer a problem
to the United States

35:33.269 --> 35:35.396
and our friends and allies.

35:35.472 --> 35:36.803
(APPLAUSE)

35:40.376 --> 35:43.345
NARRA TOR: The problem for the President,
Gonzales warned,

35:43.413 --> 35:45.779
was that some of
the new interrogation techniques

35:45.849 --> 35:49.307
were banned
under U.S. and international law.

35:49.385 --> 35:50.852
HUTSON.’ One of the points that he makes

35:50.920 --> 35:54.583
is that we don't want
the Geneva Conventions to apply,

35:55.692 --> 35:59.423
because if they do,
these things can be war crimes.

36:00.663 --> 36:04.394
What's well-known
is the principle of command responsibility.

36:04.801 --> 36:07.770
This was established in the Nuremberg trials
after World War II,

36:07.937 --> 36:11.373
and it established the principle
of international criminal law

36:11.441 --> 36:13.602
that individuals who order illegal treatment

36:13.676 --> 36:15.871
would be held accountable
for the illegal treatment,

36:15.945 --> 36:19.813
even if they're not immediately applying
that kind of abusive treatment.

36:22.218 --> 36:24.709
NARRATOR.’ To be certain that Americans
interrogating prisoners

36:24.788 --> 36:27.018
would not be accused of torture,

36:27.090 --> 36:32.050
John Yoo co-authored a memo
that would clarify the meaning of the term.

36:32.128 --> 36:35.393
LEVIN: The only prohibited acts
would be ”extreme acts, ”

36:35.465 --> 36:38.491
which are ”equivalent
to serious physical injury,

36:38.568 --> 36:43.596
”such as organ failure, impairment
ofbodily functions, or even death.”

36:44.207 --> 36:46.505
That's an illegal memo.
That's the so-called torture memo.

36:47.076 --> 36:51.342
That was an arguable interpretation
ofthe law.

36:51.414 --> 36:55.441
I'm sure we had discussions about it,
and ultimately, it was accepted

36:56.052 --> 37:01.149
because that was the ultimate decision
and position ofthe Office of Legal Counsel.

37:03.459 --> 37:07.293
MORA.’ The Office ofLegal Counsel
memorandum was unbounded,

37:07.363 --> 37:09.490
meaning, nowhere did it state

37:09.666 --> 37:13.762
that the application of cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment was prohibited.

37:13.837 --> 37:18.069
And |, at one point, asked John Yoo,
"Can the President authorize torture?"

37:18.141 --> 37:20.166
And his response was, "Yes."

37:20.910 --> 37:25.210
I think the lawyers' job is to tell people
what laws do or do not apply

37:25.281 --> 37:29.445
so that they know what space they have
to make the policy decision.

37:30.787 --> 37:32.345
(CASSEL AND YOO
SPEAKING ON RECORDING)

37:46.603 --> 37:51.006
NARRA TOR: Military lawyers were outraged
by the implications ofJohn Yoo's memo.

37:51.074 --> 37:54.771
My first involvement in this came
when l was visited

37:54.844 --> 37:56.869
by a group of very senior JAG officers

37:56.946 --> 38:00.109
more than a year before
the first story about the Abu Ghraib broke,

38:00.183 --> 38:02.811
who were very troubled
about what was going on.

38:02.886 --> 38:07.516
And the focus of their concern
was failing in the responsibilities

38:07.590 --> 38:10.957
that the military leadership had
to soldiers in the field.

38:11.027 --> 38:15.430
That was the responsibility to provide
fair, clear guidance to them

38:15.498 --> 38:19.025
as to how to behave
in these difficult circumstances.

38:19.102 --> 38:23.198
And what they saw
was an intentional decision

38:23.273 --> 38:25.639
taken at the height of the Pentagon

38:25.708 --> 38:28.905
to put out a fog ofambiguity,

38:28.978 --> 38:32.971
coupled with great pressure
to bring results,

38:33.549 --> 38:37.508
to be prepared to be violent
with the detainees.

38:37.587 --> 38:41.284
But, you know,
this violence with the detainees

38:41.724 --> 38:43.385
is a criminal act.

38:44.827 --> 38:48.160
McCAIN: They may be Al-Qaeda,
they may be Taliban,

38:48.231 --> 38:50.096
they may be the worst people in the world,

38:50.166 --> 38:52.259
and I'm sure that some of them are,

38:52.368 --> 38:56.498
but there are certain basic rules
and international agreements

38:56.572 --> 38:59.871
that the United States has agreed to,
that we will observe.

38:59.943 --> 39:01.774
You go ahead and please respond.
You wanted to.

39:01.844 --> 39:03.937
All right, very quickly, let me clarify.

39:04.013 --> 39:05.571
"The President's policy.

39:06.149 --> 39:08.140
"As a matter of policy,
the United States Armed Forces

39:08.217 --> 39:10.811
"shall continue to treat detainees humanely,

39:10.887 --> 39:14.448
"and to the extent appropriate
and consistent with military necessity,

39:14.691 --> 39:17.888
"in a manner consistent
with the principles of Geneva."

39:17.961 --> 39:22.125
That is a legalistic statement,
and one that is ridden with loopholes.

39:22.198 --> 39:25.258
And it's clear to me
the interrogators did not understand

39:25.335 --> 39:30.102
that quote, "humane treatment"
might be in the eye ofthe beholder.

39:31.808 --> 39:35.335
NARRATOR.’ In the field in Afghanistan,
there was a great deal ofconfusion

39:35.411 --> 39:37.709
about exactly what the rules were.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.878
WALLS.’ They told us, when dealing with
the PUCs, as they called them,

39:40.950 --> 39:43.009
the Persons under U.S. Custody,

39:43.086 --> 39:45.213
they don't fall under Geneva Conventions.

39:45.822 --> 39:49.849
Basically, the only thing that we weren't
allowed to do is beat them up.

39:50.259 --> 39:53.717
CORSETTI: Person Under Control,
Person Under Custody, something like that.

39:53.963 --> 39:55.863
You know, they call them anything
to dehumanize them,

39:55.932 --> 39:57.593
so that you don't look at them as people.

39:58.234 --> 40:01.567
I don't remember hearing anything
about Geneva Convention.

40:03.639 --> 40:06.369
Of course, I'm familiar with it,
but they didn't go over that,

40:06.442 --> 40:08.410
you know, in any kind of detail.

40:09.112 --> 40:11.342
I didn't know what the field manual
for interrogation...

40:11.414 --> 40:13.541
I didn't know the proper nomenclature for it.

40:13.616 --> 40:16.949
I'd seen it, there was a copy lying around,
I'm sure, somewhere.

40:17.020 --> 40:19.682
And if] had chosen to,
I could have picked it up and read it.

40:20.256 --> 40:22.622
But I was working 16-hour days.

40:22.959 --> 40:27.191
So to sit down and read a field manual
was not top ofmy priorities over there.

40:28.798 --> 40:32.757
It is a mean, nasty, dangerous,
dirty business out there,

40:32.835 --> 40:35.133
and we have to operate in that arena.

40:35.705 --> 40:37.730
I'm convinced we can do it
and we can do it successfully,

40:37.807 --> 40:39.570
but we need to make certain
that we have not

40:40.209 --> 40:43.610
tied the hands, if you will,
of our intelligence communities,

40:43.679 --> 40:46.375
in terms of accomplishing their mission.

40:46.449 --> 40:49.145
These terrorists play
by a whole set of different rules.

40:49.218 --> 40:53.416
It's going to force us, in your words,
to get "mean, dirty and nasty"

40:53.489 --> 40:55.013
-in order to take them on.
-Right.

41:05.601 --> 41:08.570
NARRATOR.’ Guided by a legal opinion
from John Yoo,

41:08.638 --> 41:12.734
the Bush administration began shipping
some high-value detainees

41:12.809 --> 41:16.370
to the U.S. naval base
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

41:18.481 --> 41:21.041
Initially, lthought, "Good, safe place."

41:21.150 --> 41:23.584
You know, "Put them there,
barbed wire all over..."

41:23.653 --> 41:27.749
Then it became apparent
that the reason we were doing it

41:27.824 --> 41:31.692
was because we were going to argue
that there's no law.

41:32.128 --> 41:35.188
You know, Cuban law didn't apply.
U.S. law didn't apply.

41:35.264 --> 41:38.131
Well, that was a big step
down the slippery slope.

41:38.267 --> 41:40.098
I think what the policy-makers
were trying to do

41:40.169 --> 41:44.367
was to try to find a place that was
physically close to the United States,

41:44.440 --> 41:45.930
that could be well protected,

41:46.008 --> 41:49.842
but still would benefit from the rule
that the United States military

41:49.912 --> 41:53.404
is the one who has ultimate say and control
over enemy prisoners

41:53.483 --> 41:55.974
who are held outside the country.

41:58.688 --> 42:03.421
One by one, the terrorists are learning
the meaning of American justice.

42:03.559 --> 42:05.288
(APPLAUSE)

42:19.275 --> 42:21.140
NARRATOR.’ In December, 2001,

42:21.210 --> 42:24.543
a man named Mohammed al-Qahtani
was swept up in Afghanistan

42:25.515 --> 42:27.449
and sent to Guantanamo.

42:28.317 --> 42:31.480
After eight months in detention,
the Army discovered

42:31.554 --> 42:34.455
that he may have trained
to be the twentieth hijacker.

42:35.158 --> 42:39.925
Suddenly, Qahtani became the
most important detainee in Guantanamo.

42:43.666 --> 42:46.464
Here we had a man who was supposed
to have been on that plane

42:46.536 --> 42:48.629
that was flown into
the Pennsylvania countryside.

42:49.038 --> 42:53.600
So I think there was a sense of urgency
to find out what this guy knew,

42:53.676 --> 42:56.167
in order to be able to prevent
any future attacks.

42:56.646 --> 43:00.275
He successfully resisted standard
interrogation techniques at Guantanamo

43:00.349 --> 43:01.441
for eight months.

43:01.517 --> 43:06.011
And he is the genesis for the request
by the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo

43:06.889 --> 43:11.292
for more techniques that might be able
to get past his resistance training.

43:12.528 --> 43:14.758
NARRATOR.’ In September, 2002,

43:14.997 --> 43:18.398
John Yoo and Alberto Gonzales
traveled to Guantanamo.

43:19.969 --> 43:24.906
Soon after their visit,
and just before Dilawar's arrival at Bagram,

43:24.974 --> 43:26.771
Donald Rumsfeld personally approved

43:26.842 --> 43:29.743
a new menu ofpsychological
interrogation techniques

43:30.513 --> 43:32.879
for use on Mohammed al-Qahtani.

43:34.116 --> 43:36.880
Exactly how the techniques
would be applied

43:36.953 --> 43:40.980
was often left to the imagination
of the interrogators.

43:50.933 --> 43:54.869
GUTIERREZ.’ His interrogations
are well documented in a log.

43:54.937 --> 43:58.771
And from November, 2002
into early January, 2003,

43:59.108 --> 44:00.837
he was subjected to this regime.

44:02.812 --> 44:05.838
It involved very severe sleep deprivation.

44:09.752 --> 44:12.312
He was only permitted
to sleep four hours a day,

44:13.856 --> 44:15.153
from 7:00 in the morning
till 11:00 in the morning,

44:15.224 --> 44:18.318
and that lasted for 50 days
with one exception.

44:20.229 --> 44:23.824
He was held in severe isolation
and sensory deprivation.

44:32.808 --> 44:35.709
There are a number of instances in the log
where you'll see the phrase,

44:35.778 --> 44:37.803
”Invasion ofspace by a female. ”

44:37.880 --> 44:43.375
And that was actually an interrogation tactic
designed to break his faith.

44:43.452 --> 44:46.353
"Interrogator approached detainee
from behind, rubbed his back,

44:46.422 --> 44:48.788
"whispered in his ear
and ran fingers through his hair.

44:48.858 --> 44:52.055
"That was authorized
under the futility technique."

44:56.499 --> 44:58.467
GUTIERREZ.’ He was subjected to what

44:58.534 --> 45:01.662
I would call sexual assault
by female interrogators.

45:04.740 --> 45:07.231
He was forced to wear women's lingerie,

45:07.310 --> 45:12.270
multiple allegations of homosexuality,
and that his comrades were aware of that.

45:12.348 --> 45:15.044
He was forced to dance
with a male interrogator,

45:15.117 --> 45:19.213
subject to strip searches
for control measures, not for security,

45:19.288 --> 45:21.085
and he was forced to perform dog tricks.

45:22.158 --> 45:25.491
All this to lower
his personal sense of worth.

45:32.168 --> 45:35.729
GUTIERREZ.’ They tried to characterize it
as individual interrogators

45:35.805 --> 45:38.069
pushing the envelope
or starting to get, quote, ”creative."

45:57.093 --> 46:00.995
(GUARDS SINGING GOD BLESS AMERICA)

46:18.848 --> 46:24.684
GUTIERREZ.’ The combination ofhis lack of
food intake and forcible hydration, led him...

46:24.754 --> 46:27.723
At one point his heart slowed down
to 35 beats a minute,

46:27.790 --> 46:29.417
and he was rushed to the hospital
to be revived.

46:41.237 --> 46:45.435
Mohammed aI-Qahtani, in many ways,
that single interrogation,

46:45.508 --> 46:46.668
protected interrogation,

46:46.742 --> 46:48.676
contains within it, if you will,

46:48.744 --> 46:54.182
the entire genealogy, the entire history,
of CIA torture over the last 50 years.

46:55.618 --> 46:58.018
The CIA launched a mind-control project,

46:58.087 --> 47:01.181
a veritable Manhattan Project of the mind,
in the 1950s.

47:01.457 --> 47:05.951
ln-house, the CIA worked
on exotic techniques. Hypnosis.

47:06.328 --> 47:07.989
And then they worked
on sodium pentothal.

47:08.063 --> 47:12.124
Then they worked on electro-shock,
and ultimately, they discovered LSD.

47:12.635 --> 47:16.127
All that drug stuff, in-house, went nowhere,
except to law suits.

47:16.939 --> 47:18.531
But what did work

47:18.607 --> 47:23.101
was the CIA outsourced all ofthe dull
behavioral research

47:23.546 --> 47:25.912
to the most brilliant behavioral scientists

47:25.981 --> 47:28.814
at the top universities in
the United States and Canada.

47:28.884 --> 47:32.752
NARRA TOR: At McGiII, experiments
by famed psychologist Donald 0. Hebb

47:32.822 --> 47:35.290
caught the eye of CIA researchers.

47:35.357 --> 47:42.092
Dr. Hebb found that he could induce a state
akin to acute psychosis in 48 hours.

47:42.898 --> 47:44.661
All he did was, he had student volunteers

47:44.800 --> 47:47.735
sit in a very pleasant
air-conditioned cubicle

47:47.803 --> 47:50.169
with goggles, gloves and ear-muffs.

47:50.272 --> 47:53.002
Actually, you know what they looked
just like? The Guantanamo detainees.

47:53.075 --> 47:56.272
If you see those outfits
that the Guantanamo detainees have,

47:56.345 --> 47:58.973
where they have the gloves,
the goggles and the ear-muffs...

47:59.048 --> 48:03.212
Now everybody thinks, ”Oh, that's security. ”
No, no, no. That's sensory breakdown.

48:03.285 --> 48:07.779
Within a day, there would be hallucinations,
within two days, breakdown.

48:08.157 --> 48:10.853
I began to think, while we were doing
our experiments,

48:10.926 --> 48:16.421
"Is it possible that something that involves
physical discomfort, or even pain,

48:16.866 --> 48:18.197
"might be more tolerable

48:18.267 --> 48:21.634
"than simply the deprivation conditions
that we studied?"

48:21.737 --> 48:24.831
McCOY.' The CIA was fascinated by this.
Theyjumped on it immediately.

48:25.207 --> 48:28.506
I had no idea of what a potentially
vicious weapon this could be.

48:29.545 --> 48:31.775
McCOY.' They identified two key techniques.

48:32.448 --> 48:34.473
They identified sensory disorientation,

48:34.550 --> 48:36.142
and they identified self-inflicted pain,

48:36.218 --> 48:39.745
standing for days at a time
while fluids flowed to the legs,

48:40.656 --> 48:46.117
and they put them together in the Kubark
Counterintelligence Interrogation manual.

48:46.195 --> 48:48.129
And they propagated it around the world

48:48.197 --> 48:50.722
and through the U.S.
intelligence community.

48:52.468 --> 48:54.732
Think about what al-Qahtani
was subjected to.

48:54.803 --> 48:59.831
First ofall, he's in dark, he's in light,
he's in cold, he's in heat.

48:59.909 --> 49:03.572
What they're doing is, they're attacking
his universal sensory receptors.

49:03.646 --> 49:05.409
They're also scrambling his time.

49:05.481 --> 49:06.914
So that's phase one.

49:08.517 --> 49:12.146
In Guantanamo,
under the regime of General Miller,

49:12.888 --> 49:17.416
he'd turned Guantanamo into a veritable
behavioral scientific laboratory,

49:17.826 --> 49:22.126
and Donald Rumsfeld gave orders
for techniques beyond the field manual.

49:22.197 --> 49:25.428
And they percolated. And they percolated
in an ambiguous way

49:25.501 --> 49:30.234
that allowed people to kind ofdo
what they thought needed to be done.

49:30.406 --> 49:35.275
And they eXplored Arab male sensitivity
to gender and sexual identity.

49:35.377 --> 49:38.039
So, that's the thing
about being homosexual,

49:38.113 --> 49:39.978
the underwear on the head,
all that sort of stuff.

49:41.717 --> 49:45.983
People were saying the Arabs really are
very sensitive to sexual humiliation.

49:46.488 --> 49:49.423
Well, who the hell isn't sensitive
to sexual humiliation, you know?

49:49.491 --> 49:50.651
Nobody wants to be stripped down naked

49:50.726 --> 49:52.853
and forced to masturbate
with a hood over your head.

49:52.928 --> 49:54.122
It's ridiculous.

49:54.863 --> 49:57.661
McCOY.' Then they created
behavioral science consultation teams,

49:57.733 --> 50:02.227
where they had military psychologists
integrated into the ongoing interrogation

50:02.371 --> 50:05.465
to discover individual fears and phobias.

50:06.175 --> 50:09.406
And all of that was visited on al-Qahtani.

50:10.312 --> 50:12.109
MAN: You are aware ofcommunications

50:12.181 --> 50:14.274
between General Miller
and Secretary Rumsfeld,

50:14.350 --> 50:16.875
specifically about this one prisoner.

50:16.952 --> 50:20.183
To our knowledge, there was
a considerable amount of communication,

50:20.255 --> 50:22.052
up and down the chain.

50:25.728 --> 50:28.629
McCOY.' As you know
from General Schmidt's report, he concluded

50:28.697 --> 50:32.098
that these techniques individually
did not constitute torture.

50:32.167 --> 50:33.998
But he said that the sum
of these techniques...

50:34.069 --> 50:35.331
"...the cumulative effect

50:35.404 --> 50:39.135
"of simultaneous applications
of numerous authorized techniques

50:39.208 --> 50:42.006
"had abusive and degrading impact
on the detainee."

50:42.077 --> 50:44.978
McCOY.' ...and he recommended
that General Miller be disciplined,

50:47.616 --> 50:49.948
but he said it did not constitute torture.

50:50.019 --> 50:54.456
We made a distinction between what torture
and inhumane treatment would be,

50:54.523 --> 50:56.320
given the general guidelines,

50:56.392 --> 50:59.327
and then what might be abusive
and degrading.

50:59.395 --> 51:02.159
Something might be degrading,
but not necessarily torture,

51:02.231 --> 51:03.926
and it may not be inhumane.

51:03.999 --> 51:06.729
It may be humiliating,
but it may not be torture.

51:07.403 --> 51:09.598
No torture, no physical pain or injury.

51:09.672 --> 51:13.039
There was a safe, secure environment
the entire time.

51:13.108 --> 51:17.704
And that, of course, is the genius
ofthe CIA's psychological paradigm.

51:17.846 --> 51:20.041
Psychological torture
is all a matter of definitions,

51:20.115 --> 51:22.174
and it's very slippery indeed.

51:23.886 --> 51:27.879
That sounds remarkably similar
to what occurred at Abu Ghraib.

51:27.956 --> 51:32.188
People being led around in chains,
people being forced to wear lingerie.

51:34.196 --> 51:35.663
Perhaps a coincidence, perhaps not.

51:38.167 --> 51:39.532
McCOY.' If you look at those
Abu Ghraib photographs,

51:39.601 --> 51:42.035
again, it's always the same techniques.

51:42.104 --> 51:45.301
First of all, there's the sexual activity
with the woman's garments

51:45.374 --> 51:49.743
and the masturbation and all the rest.
That's the cultural sensitivity.

51:49.812 --> 51:51.803
The y're short-shackled,
the y're long-shackled,

51:51.880 --> 51:53.507
they're shackled upside down.

51:53.582 --> 51:55.106
These are stress positions.

51:55.951 --> 51:59.148
The most famous of all Abu Ghraib
photographs, of course,

51:59.254 --> 52:03.156
ofthat hooded Iraqi, standing on a box,
arms outstretched.

52:04.259 --> 52:07.786
He's told that if he steps off the box,
if he moves, he'll be electrocuted.

52:07.863 --> 52:10.263
That's the point of the fake electrical wires.

52:10.332 --> 52:13.426
So it's the absolute immobility
for protracted periods,

52:13.502 --> 52:15.231
and then with arms extended.

52:16.672 --> 52:19.505
As we'd say to viewers,
”Don't try this at home, ” but do try it.

52:19.575 --> 52:25.172
Just stand, for 10 minutes,
with your arms stretched out, not moving.

52:26.849 --> 52:28.510
NARRATOR.’ Carolyn Wood was an example

52:28.584 --> 52:31.075
of the way new techniques
spread and mutated

52:31.153 --> 52:32.677
like a virus.

52:33.288 --> 52:36.780
Long before Wood took charge
of interrogation at Abu Ghraib,

52:36.859 --> 52:39.692
her unit was involved
with harsh techniques at Bagram,

52:39.762 --> 52:44.028
including stress positions,
forced standing and sleep deprivation.

52:44.199 --> 52:48.135
GOLDEN: One of the memoranda shows
that, in early December, 2002,

52:48.270 --> 52:51.865
the interrogators at Bagram
just looked on the Internet,

52:51.940 --> 52:53.430
they're in touch with the guys
at Guantanamo,

52:53.509 --> 52:55.477
and they learned
that these guys at Guantanamo

52:55.544 --> 52:58.843
had gotten new techniques
from the Secretary of Defense,

52:58.914 --> 53:00.040
and theyjust started using them,

53:00.115 --> 53:02.879
even though the techniques
had clearly been approved

53:02.951 --> 53:05.215
exclusively for use at Guantanamo.

53:07.256 --> 53:13.024
McCOY.' When General Miller himself traveled
from Guantanamo to Iraq in August, 2003,

53:13.095 --> 53:15.325
he brought with him a CD and a manual

53:15.397 --> 53:18.423
on the advanced techniques
they'd developed at Guantanamo

53:18.500 --> 53:21.492
and he gave them
to General Sanchez's command.

53:21.904 --> 53:25.533
So, there are these multiple paths
that you can trace,

53:25.641 --> 53:28.132
whereby these interrogation techniques

53:28.210 --> 53:32.306
go through this global migration
through Afghanistan to Iraq,

53:32.414 --> 53:34.405
from Guantanamo directly to Iraq,

53:34.483 --> 53:36.883
and that result is Abu Ghraib.

53:40.622 --> 53:43.887
NARRATOR.’ Well before the abuses
at Abu Ghraib became public,

53:43.959 --> 53:46.826
government officials
had been quietly raising concerns

53:46.895 --> 53:49.989
about harsh techniques
in use at Guantanamo.

53:50.833 --> 53:54.826
There were e-mails back to the Department
of Justice from FBI personnel

53:54.903 --> 53:57.337
down at Guantanamo
saying, "You won't believe

53:58.040 --> 53:59.598
"what's going on down here.

53:59.675 --> 54:03.076
"We've got to disassociate ourselves,
as FBI people,

54:03.145 --> 54:05.670
"from what is going on here
in Guantanamo."

54:06.548 --> 54:07.947
This e-mail says,

54:08.016 --> 54:11.884
"The DOD has their marching orders
from the Secretary of Defense..."

54:13.555 --> 54:15.580
"Marching orders
from the Secretary of Defense."

54:15.657 --> 54:18.387
"...to engage in practices
which the FBI finds

54:18.460 --> 54:21.918
"to be deeply offensive and dangerous."

54:21.997 --> 54:25.660
But the e-mails are what are called redacted,

54:26.001 --> 54:29.903
which means that there's big holes
in these emails.

54:29.972 --> 54:32.805
Now, some ofthese emails
are totally redacted,

54:32.875 --> 54:33.933
so we don't know what they say at all.

54:34.009 --> 54:38.173
That's an example
of a lot ofthe documents that we got here.

54:39.648 --> 54:42.014
You can't see anything on these documents.

54:42.251 --> 54:44.981
One after another, where there's nothing.

54:52.861 --> 54:55.625
MORA.’ In early December, 2002,

54:55.697 --> 54:58.791
lhad heard that there was
detainee abuse going on.

54:58.867 --> 55:02.394
I called the Army General Counsel and
asked him whether he had any information.

55:02.471 --> 55:05.531
lsaid, ”I'm receiving reports that some
detainees are being abused in Guantanamo.

55:05.607 --> 55:07.165
”Do you know anything about this?”

55:07.242 --> 55:08.641
And his response back was,

55:08.744 --> 55:10.712
"I know a lot about it.

55:10.779 --> 55:12.178
"Come on down to my office."

55:12.247 --> 55:14.943
They pushed a stack of documents
across the desk.

55:15.384 --> 55:17.750
The top document was a memorandum

55:17.819 --> 55:21.619
from the General Counsel, Department
of Defense, to Secretary Rumsfeld,

55:21.690 --> 55:24.420
and it was that covert memo
that requested the authorization

55:24.493 --> 55:27.223
for the application
of certain interrogation techniques,

55:27.296 --> 55:30.060
and the top memo gave
Secretary Rumsfeld's approval

55:30.132 --> 55:33.226
for the application
ofsome of those techniques.

55:33.302 --> 55:36.396
It's the memo with Secretary Rumsfeld's
handwritten notations on the bottom,

55:36.471 --> 55:38.769
saying that he stands
eight to ten hours a day,

55:38.874 --> 55:42.742
how come these detainees are only required
to stand up to four hours a day?

55:44.246 --> 55:47.682
I was astounded, but my first reaction
was that this was a mistake.

55:47.749 --> 55:51.708
Somebodyjust didn't read the documents
carefully enough.

55:52.955 --> 55:55.947
GOLDEN: I think people in the Pentagon
thought ofAlberto Mora

55:56.024 --> 55:59.858
as a loyal Republican political appointee.

55:59.928 --> 56:02.954
He would never have been
considered a rabble-rouser

56:03.031 --> 56:04.794
ora liberal.

56:05.133 --> 56:10.298
He said he expected
that he would raise these issues

56:10.372 --> 56:12.863
and people in positions ofauthority
would say,

56:12.941 --> 56:16.934
"Oh, thanks for letting us know,"
and that would be the end of it.

56:17.879 --> 56:21.747
INTERVIEWER: I want to ask you about
a memo that was written by Alberto Mora.

56:21.817 --> 56:24.650
Do you recall on this memo that you wrote
a little notation on the bottom

56:24.720 --> 56:27.052
about standing more than four hours

56:27.122 --> 56:28.111
-because you stand at your desk...
-I do.

56:28.190 --> 56:29.384
I do.

56:29.725 --> 56:34.526
This attorney argued that that could be
interpreted by some as a wink and a nod

56:34.596 --> 56:37.861
that it would be okay
to go beyond the techniques

56:37.933 --> 56:40.902
-that were prescribed in the memo.
-No. No, no, no. It didn't...

56:40.969 --> 56:43.301
There's no wink and a nod about anything.

56:43.372 --> 56:44.805
There was one provision in there

56:44.873 --> 56:48.365
that they would have people stand
for several hours,

56:48.443 --> 56:51.640
and it was a semi-humorous remark

56:52.247 --> 56:55.580
that a person in his seventies
stands all day long.

56:55.684 --> 56:58.812
Ijust mused that,
and maybe it shouldn't have gone out,

56:58.920 --> 57:02.481
but it did, and I wrote it, and life goes on.

57:02.557 --> 57:06.015
But his point was that you should've
gotten much better advice

57:06.161 --> 57:09.756
-from your legal staff.
-I heard your question the first time.

57:09.831 --> 57:11.560
MORA.’ What was ofconcern to me
was the techniques,

57:11.633 --> 57:13.726
either individual or in combination,

57:13.802 --> 57:15.360
could rise to the level of torture.

57:15.437 --> 57:17.268
Okay, you're permitting
certain interrogation techniques,

57:17.339 --> 57:19.569
but certainly there must be some limit

57:19.641 --> 57:22.610
which is set upon the severity
of the techniques.

57:23.045 --> 57:25.104
Light deprivation could mean

57:25.180 --> 57:28.047
placing the detainee in a dark room
for 15 minutes,

57:28.116 --> 57:30.243
or it could mean a month,
or two months, or three months,

57:30.419 --> 57:31.408
until he goes blind.

57:32.521 --> 57:34.989
Detainee specific phobia techniques.

57:35.257 --> 57:38.249
The snakes, the bats, the rats,
lock somebody up in a coffin...

57:38.660 --> 57:40.423
You're limited only by your imagination.

57:40.495 --> 57:44.829
Any one of these techniques, individually,
could yield the results of torture.

57:44.900 --> 57:47.528
Certainly, in combination,
you could reach that fairly quickly.

57:48.136 --> 57:50.696
See, if you put a person into this procedure,

57:50.772 --> 57:53.240
and keep them there
for more than the siX or eight days

57:53.308 --> 57:56.277
that I would think might be
the maximum tolerability,

57:56.778 --> 57:58.336
then the price is pretty high.

57:58.413 --> 58:00.210
INTERVIEWER: The price is
someone's sanity?

58:00.282 --> 58:01.806
Presumably, it could be.

58:02.884 --> 58:06.012
The medical literature
had a phenomenon known as "force drift"

58:06.088 --> 58:09.649
that made it almost inevitable
that the interrogators would continue

58:09.724 --> 58:14.024
applying greater and greater increments
of force to achieve their desired results.

58:14.096 --> 58:16.496
WILKERSON.’ For example,
take Secretary Rumsfeld's memo.

58:16.565 --> 58:19.591
And to say that, "Well, look,
he said the dogs have to be muzzled."

58:20.102 --> 58:24.163
Well, that's a man who doesn't understand
the military on the ground.

58:24.239 --> 58:27.299
Because when that E-6 is sitting there
with that muzzled dog

58:27.375 --> 58:32.142
and there is absolutely no impact
on that person being interrogated,

58:32.481 --> 58:34.642
he's going to take that muzzle off.

58:34.716 --> 58:37.583
That's reality. That's human nature.

58:39.254 --> 58:42.781
NARRA TOR: Alberto Mora threatened
to go on record with his concerns

58:42.858 --> 58:45.520
unless the techniques were rescinded.

58:45.594 --> 58:50.861
When, after the fact, it turns out that there's
concern about it, that it concerns me,

58:50.932 --> 58:54.834
then I'm happy to rescind it
and take another fresh look at it

58:54.903 --> 58:58.168
and talk to more people about it
and see what ought to be done.

58:58.240 --> 59:01.698
To his credit, Secretary Rumsfeld
did rescind the interrogation techniques.

59:01.776 --> 59:05.041
And then, for over a year and a half,
I heard no reports from any quarter

59:05.113 --> 59:07.445
about detainee abuse anywhere.

59:15.023 --> 59:17.787
MORA.’ When Abu Ghraib hit,
my first thought was,

59:18.793 --> 59:20.988
had I been circumvented?

59:21.062 --> 59:25.123
Had there been authorizations
for the abuse ofprisoners

59:25.200 --> 59:27.191
that I had not learned about?

59:29.638 --> 59:32.232
NARRA TOR: Had the orders really
been rescinded?

59:34.576 --> 59:36.168
According to interrogators,

59:36.244 --> 59:40.476
the use of shackling, dogs, stress positions,
and sensory assault

59:40.615 --> 59:42.742
continued to be widespread.

59:44.452 --> 59:47.819
Tony Lagouranis was an interrogator
who arrived in Iraq

59:47.889 --> 59:51.381
after the military became aware
of the abuses at Abu Ghraib.

59:52.494 --> 59:54.894
LAGOURANIS.’ Among the interrogation
guidelines they gave us,

59:54.963 --> 59:58.364
it said that dogs are authorized
to be used on detainees.

59:58.433 --> 1:00:01.129
You know, stress positions,
sleep deprivation,

1:00:01.203 --> 1:00:05.162
all ofthose things that I did
that I would consider harsh techniques

1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:07.401
or violating the Geneva Conventions,

1:00:07.475 --> 1:00:08.908
l was told to do.

1:00:08.977 --> 1:00:12.242
We were told to do that
to these people by our superiors.

1:00:14.883 --> 1:00:19.684
HUTSON.’ The spine of the United States
armed forces is the chain ofcommand.

1:00:20.155 --> 1:00:22.749
What starts at the top of the chain
of command drops like a rock

1:00:22.857 --> 1:00:24.722
down the chain ofcommand.

1:00:24.793 --> 1:00:29.230
And that's why Lynndie England knew
what Donald Rumsfeld was thinking

1:00:29.297 --> 1:00:32.130
without actually talking to Donald Rumsfeld.

1:00:34.402 --> 1:00:36.370
NARRATOR.’ In the wake ofAbu Ghraib,

1:00:36.438 --> 1:00:40.272
journalists began to look harder
at previous cases of abuse

1:00:40.342 --> 1:00:44.176
to try to understand what had caused them,
and who was responsible.

1:00:46.648 --> 1:00:49.674
WILKERSON.’ People like Tim Golden
at The New York Times got a hold ofit

1:00:49.751 --> 1:00:53.414
and started looking at the case of Dilawar,
in particular, the taXi driver.

1:00:53.488 --> 1:00:57.219
It became at least plausible to me

1:00:57.292 --> 1:00:58.953
that this man wasn't even guilty ofanything

1:00:59.027 --> 1:01:01.495
other than being there
when the sweep occurred.

1:01:01.563 --> 1:01:04.623
And here was a guy
who was murdered in detention.

1:01:15.844 --> 1:01:19.041
MAN: ...paying tribute to those
whose lives were taken,

1:01:19.114 --> 1:01:22.015
to those who deigned
to give unselfishly of themselves.

1:01:22.117 --> 1:01:26.053
Four years ago,
our nation came under attack...

1:01:26.121 --> 1:01:27.884
GOLDEN: 9/11 was very much in the air,

1:01:27.956 --> 1:01:30.390
and I think the officers tried
to keep it in the air.

1:01:30.458 --> 1:01:33.894
They tried to remind these kids
that these people are our enemies.

1:01:35.130 --> 1:01:37.155
But it's hard to see
how these young soldiers

1:01:37.232 --> 1:01:40.201
could have been expected to figure out
who their real enemies were

1:01:40.268 --> 1:01:42.736
among a bunch ofmilitiamen and farmers

1:01:42.804 --> 1:01:45.898
in a society
that was completely foreign to them.

1:01:49.678 --> 1:01:51.805
lfl remember correctly, his story

1:01:52.447 --> 1:01:55.644
had something to do with a rocket attack
on a military base,

1:01:56.051 --> 1:01:58.611
and he was supposed to be
the driver of the getaway car.

1:01:59.454 --> 1:02:02.890
GOLDEN: He had taken his new car,
which he was obviously excited about,

1:02:02.957 --> 1:02:08.827
and driven to Khost, the provincial capital,
where he went to look for taxi passengers.

1:02:08.897 --> 1:02:12.993
And he, in fact, found these three men
in Khost, at the marketplace,

1:02:13.134 --> 1:02:14.965
who were headed back to Yakubi.

1:02:15.170 --> 1:02:16.398
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:21.101
GOLDEN: You have to imagine that Dilawar

1:02:21.176 --> 1:02:24.873
was driving home from
this provincial capital,

1:02:24.946 --> 1:02:28.177
which was about as far
as his world stretched.

1:02:28.249 --> 1:02:34.051
He is stopped at Fire Base Salerno
by a group ofAfghan militiamen,

1:02:34.189 --> 1:02:38.592
and the men apparently found
an electric stabilizer in the trunk of the car.

1:02:38.993 --> 1:02:40.585
At least they claimed to.

1:02:41.262 --> 1:02:45.961
Camp Salerno had been rocketed
from some distance earlier in the day,

1:02:46.034 --> 1:02:50.130
and the Afghan militiamen
immediately arrested the four guys

1:02:50.205 --> 1:02:53.402
on suspicion ofhaving had
some involvement in that attack.

1:02:55.110 --> 1:02:58.443
He's taken to Bagram,
this great distance away.

1:02:59.481 --> 1:03:02.917
You get a bunch ofguys
who are back at this detention site,

1:03:02.984 --> 1:03:04.611
and they're told, ”We have evidence

1:03:04.686 --> 1:03:08.588
”that they have been involved
in a rocket attack on American forces. ”

1:03:08.656 --> 1:03:11.591
So I think that kind of
tripped a wire in them.

1:03:13.395 --> 1:03:16.922
LAGOURANIS.’ You're in this atmosphere,
you're with nothing but military people,

1:03:16.998 --> 1:03:19.558
and you feel sort of morally isolated

1:03:19.667 --> 1:03:21.931
and you lose your moral bearings.

1:03:22.003 --> 1:03:24.198
And you're frustrated,
because you're not getting intelligence

1:03:24.272 --> 1:03:27.605
from a prisoner that you believe is guilty
and has intelligence to give you,

1:03:27.675 --> 1:03:30.075
and so, of course,
you want to start pushing the limits.

1:03:30.145 --> 1:03:32.841
You wanna see how far you can go.

1:03:33.114 --> 1:03:36.208
A lot of the pressure came from the fact that

1:03:37.118 --> 1:03:42.021
we had a few high-value detainees
that gave a lot of good information,

1:03:42.724 --> 1:03:45.625
and when we started
to lose those detainees

1:03:45.693 --> 1:03:47.718
due to going to Guantanamo Bay,

1:03:48.296 --> 1:03:50.696
that they expected this
to come from everybody.

1:03:51.166 --> 1:03:55.899
We would interrogate some of these guys
just to interrogate them.

1:03:55.970 --> 1:03:58.564
And it was ridiculous.
I mean, you'd get some ofthese guys in,

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:03.509
and you're like, "This is the wrong man.
This is not who we're supposed to have."

1:04:04.045 --> 1:04:06.707
Especially being a screener, you could tell
from the moment you got them in,

1:04:06.781 --> 1:04:08.908
you're like, ”Not supposed to have them.”

1:04:10.018 --> 1:04:14.546
We had one prisoner came in
who was mentally challenged,

1:04:15.790 --> 1:04:20.318
and Sergeant Loring kept saying
that, you know, "This is a cover.

1:04:20.395 --> 1:04:23.455
"This is AI-Qaeda's cover.
This is what they do."

1:04:23.531 --> 1:04:26.762
And I went in there and talked to him, and...

1:04:29.270 --> 1:04:31.864
Basically they had this guy in a diaper,

1:04:33.341 --> 1:04:34.808
and he ate his own feces,

1:04:34.876 --> 1:04:37.436
but Loring kept saying it was an act.

1:04:38.012 --> 1:04:40.640
They'd be, like, "Hey, we want you
to go yell at this guy."

1:04:40.715 --> 1:04:44.242
So I'd grab my box of Frosted Flakes
that l was eating for breakfast that morning,

1:04:44.319 --> 1:04:47.254
I'd go into the room, and I'd be like,
”All right, [have to yell at you today. ”

1:04:47.322 --> 1:04:51.315
So I'd be like,
"Dihydronated salt substitute!"

1:04:51.426 --> 1:04:53.553
and just start yelling that at them,
and they'd be like...

1:04:53.661 --> 1:04:56.630
They'd look at me all crazy,
and I'd be like, "Yeah!

1:04:56.698 --> 1:04:59.599
"It's your fault they put that
in my cereal, now!"

1:04:59.667 --> 1:05:02.727
Or I'd yell at them if, you know,
Elvis was really the king of rock,

1:05:02.804 --> 1:05:04.328
or if he was dead, or stuff like that.

1:05:04.405 --> 1:05:06.270
And I'd write that
in my interrogation summaries,

1:05:06.341 --> 1:05:09.833
and I'd send that up to higher,
that that's what I did for that two hours.

1:05:10.178 --> 1:05:11.975
You really can't get a feel for a person

1:05:12.046 --> 1:05:14.810
till after you've talked to them
a couple oftimes.

1:05:14.883 --> 1:05:18.319
So on the first three times I talked to him,
I was just verifying his story,

1:05:18.419 --> 1:05:21.115
looking for loops, looking for holes.

1:05:21.189 --> 1:05:24.886
After the third time I talked to him,
and his story was still consistent,

1:05:24.959 --> 1:05:27.621
I kept telling them
I thought he was innocent.

1:05:27.695 --> 1:05:29.788
LAGOURANIS.’ And they wanted
these people to be guilty,

1:05:29.864 --> 1:05:32.025
because that would look better
for their unit.

1:05:32.100 --> 1:05:34.967
They could say that,
”We arrested 60 people this month,

1:05:35.036 --> 1:05:36.526
”and they were all terrorists. ”

1:05:36.604 --> 1:05:38.333
"When was the last time
you saw Osama bin Laden?

1:05:38.406 --> 1:05:39.737
"When was the last time
you saw Mullah Omar?"

1:05:39.807 --> 1:05:43.243
Now, this was a standard question
that was asked of every detainee.

1:05:43.845 --> 1:05:46.313
It's very hard to go into an interrogation
with very little evidence,

1:05:46.381 --> 1:05:48.542
and we almost never had evidence
on these guys,

1:05:48.616 --> 1:05:50.106
and elicit a confession.

1:05:50.184 --> 1:05:51.549
You can go in and get intelligence,

1:05:51.619 --> 1:05:54.884
but if you're asking this guy
to completely incriminate himself,

1:05:54.956 --> 1:05:55.945
it's very difficult.

1:05:56.057 --> 1:05:58.651
So you have to start using
harsher and harsher techniques

1:05:58.726 --> 1:06:00.956
in order to elicit that confession.

1:06:02.397 --> 1:06:05.798
WALLS.’ I was yelled at for being too nice
to him by Sergeant Loring,

1:06:06.134 --> 1:06:08.159
that I needed to put more pressure on him.

1:06:08.236 --> 1:06:10.704
Or, as he liked to say, I needed to
"take him out of his comfort zone."

1:06:15.176 --> 1:06:18.907
GOLDEN: After a while, particularly
in the fourth and fifth interrogations,

1:06:18.980 --> 1:06:22.575
as the sleep deprivation
that he was being subjected to

1:06:22.684 --> 1:06:28.122
really started to knock him out,
the interrogations got more intense.

1:06:28.656 --> 1:06:32.285
Sergeant Salcedo, who was
an inexperienced interrogator

1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:34.555
but a kind ofa can-do soldier,

1:06:34.629 --> 1:06:38.065
had this man who refused to look at her
because she was a woman.

1:06:38.132 --> 1:06:42.091
She said she got very frustrated by this,
and grabbed him by the sides ofthe face

1:06:42.170 --> 1:06:46.231
and sort ofturned him to face her
and look at her and take her seriously,

1:06:46.307 --> 1:06:48.502
but, of course,

1:06:48.576 --> 1:06:53.536
he was an Afghan man
from a tribal, conservative culture

1:06:53.615 --> 1:06:56.049
who didn't look at strange women.

1:06:57.452 --> 1:07:00.012
WALLS.’ Sergeant Salcedo was getting
a little aggravated,

1:07:00.088 --> 1:07:01.851
sol kind of stepped in between them,

1:07:01.923 --> 1:07:04.824
and that's when I grabbed him by the shirt

1:07:04.892 --> 1:07:06.826
and I brought him over to the wall.

1:07:07.195 --> 1:07:09.595
They tried to make him stand up
against the wall,

1:07:09.664 --> 1:07:12.462
and he was sliding down,
they pushed him back against the wall.

1:07:12.734 --> 1:07:17.330
He wasn't making any kind of sense.
Most of it seemed to just be rambling.

1:07:18.473 --> 1:07:23.342
The interpreter was telling me
that his wife came to visit him in his cell,

1:07:24.579 --> 1:07:27.343
which, ofcourse, didn't happen.

1:07:29.250 --> 1:07:31.514
If you've ever seen anybody sleep-depped,

1:07:33.388 --> 1:07:36.721
past two days,
they begin to just be bumbling idiots.

1:07:38.493 --> 1:07:40.757
Three days, they're just worthless.

1:07:41.562 --> 1:07:43.587
I knew something was wrong.

1:07:44.565 --> 1:07:47.227
The next thing I heard was that he'd died.

1:07:49.504 --> 1:07:51.802
GOLDEN: Not long after Dilawar was killed,

1:07:51.873 --> 1:07:54.774
we learned that the Afghan
guerrilla commander

1:07:54.842 --> 1:07:57.402
whose men had arrested Dilawar
and the others

1:07:57.478 --> 1:08:00.879
had, in fact, been detained
by the Americans himself.

1:08:00.948 --> 1:08:04.008
And it turned out
that he was rocketing their base,

1:08:04.085 --> 1:08:08.021
and then picking up innocent Afghans
and turning them over to the Americans,

1:08:08.089 --> 1:08:11.991
essentially to try to ingratiate himself
with the U.S. forces.

1:08:14.862 --> 1:08:17.888
The three passengers
were sent to Guantanamo,

1:08:17.965 --> 1:08:21.492
and they didn't get out until March of 2004,

1:08:21.602 --> 1:08:26.039
which was 15 months after they had
been captured riding in the taxi.

1:08:29.077 --> 1:08:32.672
It's hard to know what reason
the Americans would have had

1:08:32.747 --> 1:08:34.044
to send these guys on,

1:08:34.549 --> 1:08:38.747
when they had quite clearly concluded

1:08:38.820 --> 1:08:42.756
that Dilawar, at least, was an innocent man
when he was killed.

1:08:42.824 --> 1:08:43.813
Um...

1:08:45.793 --> 1:08:47.351
It certainly makes you wonder

1:08:47.428 --> 1:08:52.058
about whether they just sent these guys on
to cover their butts.

1:08:59.574 --> 1:09:03.237
MAN: These are not mere innocents.
These are among the worst of the worst.

1:09:03.311 --> 1:09:09.272
These are among the most dangerous,
best-trained, vicious killers

1:09:09.851 --> 1:09:11.478
on the face of the Earth.

1:09:11.853 --> 1:09:14.879
They're terrorists, they're bomb-makers,
they're facilitators of terror,

1:09:14.956 --> 1:09:17.516
they're members of AI-Qaeda
and the Taliban.

1:09:17.592 --> 1:09:20.322
And if they were free, they would
engage in murder once again.

1:09:20.461 --> 1:09:23.487
Well, the only thing I know for certain
is that these are bad people.

1:09:24.165 --> 1:09:27.931
Despite Rumsfeld's and Cheney's
and President Bush's allegations

1:09:28.002 --> 1:09:29.902
that these guys are the worst of the worst,

1:09:29.971 --> 1:09:31.632
that they were all captured
on the battlefield,

1:09:31.939 --> 1:09:36.638
recent studies of the whole compendium
of government's documents show

1:09:36.711 --> 1:09:39.771
that only 5% of these people
were picked up by the United States.

1:09:39.947 --> 1:09:41.312
Aaron, search him!

1:09:41.582 --> 1:09:45.143
Only 8% of them are accused
of being members of the Al-Qaeda.

1:09:45.553 --> 1:09:50.354
Over 90% of them were picked up
by Northern Alliance or Pakistani forces

1:09:50.424 --> 1:09:52.119
in exchange for bounties.

1:09:52.193 --> 1:09:54.423
CHENEY: We have large rewards out.

1:09:54.729 --> 1:09:59.166
We have leaflets that are dropping
like snowflakes

1:09:59.233 --> 1:10:00.928
in December in Chicago.

1:10:01.002 --> 1:10:02.435
JOURNALIST: Mr. Secretary?
Mr. Secretary...

1:10:02.937 --> 1:10:05.997
NARRA TOR: An analysis of declassified
government documents

1:10:06.207 --> 1:10:09.836
revealed that only 7%
of Guantanamo detainees

1:10:09.911 --> 1:10:12.744
were captured by U. S. and Coalition forces.

1:10:12.947 --> 1:10:16.644
The other 93%,
like Dilawar and his passengers,

1:10:16.717 --> 1:10:19.686
were turned over by Afghan warlords
and Pakistanis,

1:10:20.354 --> 1:10:22.447
sometimes for cash payments
of thousands ofdollars.

1:10:22.523 --> 1:10:23.717
(MURMURING)

1:10:24.926 --> 1:10:29.295
The military's not interested in spending
whatever it is, $40,000 dollars a year,

1:10:29.363 --> 1:10:33.390
detaining people who are not members
of AI-Qaeda in Guantanamo Bay.

1:10:33.467 --> 1:10:35.833
It has as much interest
as everyone else does

1:10:35.903 --> 1:10:38.872
in making sure that people who are detained
are actually members ofAl-Qaeda

1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:42.706
rather than wasting resources and time
detaining innocent people.

1:10:43.544 --> 1:10:47.139
I think it's natural, in times of war,
to pick up people.

1:10:47.415 --> 1:10:50.179
You want to pick up anyone
you suspect of being dangerous.

1:10:50.251 --> 1:10:53.778
What's different here is, the government,
for the first time in our history,

1:10:53.855 --> 1:10:58.053
didn't follow its own regulations,
which require that a hearing be held

1:10:58.125 --> 1:11:01.060
promptly after capture, if there's any doubt.

1:11:01.128 --> 1:11:06.623
In the war in Afghanistan back in 2001,
the U.S. military was prepared

1:11:06.701 --> 1:11:08.498
to follow the Geneva Conventions
and conduct those tribunals.

1:11:08.569 --> 1:11:11.197
Unfortunately, the civilian leadership
within the Department of Defense

1:11:11.272 --> 1:11:12.830
told them to stop.

1:11:13.274 --> 1:11:15.208
Once somebody in Afghanistan
might have said,

1:11:15.276 --> 1:11:18.734
”Okay, this person's a high-value target. ”
For whatever reason,

1:11:18.813 --> 1:11:22.681
whether it was based on some other Afghani
who hated that person

1:11:22.750 --> 1:11:25.685
and wanted him out
so he could take over his opium crop,

1:11:25.753 --> 1:11:28.313
then that began the road to Gitmo,

1:11:28.389 --> 1:11:31.688
and there was no way
for that person to challenge it,

1:11:32.326 --> 1:11:33.623
and there still hasn't been.

1:11:35.563 --> 1:11:40.057
NARRA TOR: Moazzam Begg, a British subject
suspected of ties to Al-Qaeda operatives,

1:11:40.234 --> 1:11:43.761
was picked up
by local intelligence agents in Pakistan.

1:11:43.838 --> 1:11:48.298
BEGG.’ I was in my house in Islamabad
at the time when I was abducted.

1:11:48.376 --> 1:11:51.243
A hood was placed over my head,
my hands and legs were shackled

1:11:51.312 --> 1:11:53.280
and l was physically carried
into the back of the vehicle.

1:11:54.749 --> 1:11:57.684
I didn't see my family again after that point.

1:11:58.019 --> 1:12:00.817
I was sent to Kandahar, and then to Bagram.

1:12:00.988 --> 1:12:04.549
And when I was put onto the transport plane
to Guantanamo,

1:12:04.692 --> 1:12:09.288
I had already been covered, almost from
head to toe, in some sort ofa covering.

1:12:09.463 --> 1:12:12.261
Face mask, earmuffs, blackened goggles.

1:12:12.333 --> 1:12:15.564
And then, just in case I could see anything,
a hood to cover it with.

1:12:16.971 --> 1:12:19.371
Being seated on the aircraft
was excruciatingly painful.

1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:21.499
They'd already used, now,
the three-piece suit,

1:12:21.575 --> 1:12:23.907
and that is the shackle
that goes around the waist

1:12:23.978 --> 1:12:25.502
and is padlocked to the back.

1:12:25.579 --> 1:12:28.013
It was impossible to move,
impossible to breathe properly,

1:12:28.082 --> 1:12:29.572
impossible to hear anything.

1:12:29.650 --> 1:12:33.108
And so, I managed to scream
and pleaded with one of the guards

1:12:33.187 --> 1:12:35.815
to give me a needle to put me to sleep.

1:12:45.199 --> 1:12:49.636
SMITH: We fought for two-and-a-half years
forjust the right to go see the prisoners,

1:12:49.704 --> 1:12:52.901
and then fought for months more
to get security clearance

1:12:52.974 --> 1:12:54.999
so the military would let you in there.

1:12:55.376 --> 1:12:56.809
This is bizarre.

1:12:56.877 --> 1:13:02.008
It never occurred to me,
when I went to law school in America,

1:13:02.083 --> 1:13:05.780
that we'd be sitting around talking about
whether we could have access to our clients

1:13:05.853 --> 1:13:07.480
and whether our clients have been tortured.

1:13:08.456 --> 1:13:11.892
WILNER.’ Habeas corpus is really the essence
of the rule oflaw.

1:13:12.426 --> 1:13:16.385
Not giving people a basic hearing
when you take away their liberty

1:13:16.464 --> 1:13:18.364
is one ofthe reasons
we fought the Revolution,

1:13:18.432 --> 1:13:21.230
that the king can't deprive somebody
of liberty without a hearing.

1:13:22.169 --> 1:13:24.763
(DRUM ROLLING)

1:13:25.973 --> 1:13:28.498
(BAND PLAYING
THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER)

1:14:20.194 --> 1:14:22.788
NARRATOR.’ In 2004, two-and-a-half years

1:14:22.863 --> 1:14:25.991
after the first detainees
had arrived in Guantanamo,

1:14:26.067 --> 1:14:29.161
the Supreme Court rejected
the Bush administration's claims

1:14:29.236 --> 1:14:31.636
that it could hold detainees indefinitely

1:14:31.705 --> 1:14:35.698
without allowing them to challenge
their detention in the courts.

1:14:36.243 --> 1:14:40.680
After the decision,
the military installed special new tribunals

1:14:40.748 --> 1:14:44.411
to judge whether detainees
should remain in Guantanamo.

1:14:44.485 --> 1:14:46.385
The Combatant Status Review Tribunals,

1:14:46.454 --> 1:14:49.514
which the government hurriedly
put in place

1:14:49.590 --> 1:14:52.150
you know, nine days after we won
before the Supreme Court,

1:14:52.226 --> 1:14:53.215
are ajoke.

1:14:53.861 --> 1:14:55.453
SMITH: You have no rights.
You have no right to a lawyer,

1:14:55.529 --> 1:14:59.966
you have no meaningful right to witnesses,
you don't really know what the charges are,

1:15:00.034 --> 1:15:02.298
and you certainly don't know
what the secret evidence is against you.

1:15:02.369 --> 1:15:03.631
They may not ever know it,

1:15:03.938 --> 1:15:09.934
but that doesn't eliminate the opportunity
they have to make a case for why...

1:15:10.010 --> 1:15:11.841
lfthey were returned in the future,

1:15:11.912 --> 1:15:14.278
why they would not continue
to pose a threat.

1:15:14.982 --> 1:15:19.510
SMITH: My clients are found not guilty
at the CSRT tribunals,

1:15:19.587 --> 1:15:21.612
and then the military thinks
that doesn't sound so good.

1:15:21.689 --> 1:15:25.181
They were being called
"Not Enemy Combatants," NEC,

1:15:25.259 --> 1:15:29.662
but now they're NLEC, which means
"No Longer Enemy Combatants."

1:15:29.730 --> 1:15:32.255
Because we want to say that
they were guilty to begin with,

1:15:32.333 --> 1:15:34.767
but now they've had a change of heart
so they're not guilty anymore,

1:15:34.835 --> 1:15:36.393
but we were right in the first place.

1:15:37.004 --> 1:15:42.169
These men aren't necessarily innocent men.
That's not an accurate characterization.

1:15:43.144 --> 1:15:46.045
You're more accurate in their long title,

1:15:46.113 --> 1:15:49.879
"No Longer Identified
as an Enemy Combatant."

1:15:49.950 --> 1:15:53.078
They're being held separate
from the remainder ofthe detainees

1:15:53.154 --> 1:15:57.853
until the United States government
can find a country they can be returned to.

1:15:58.492 --> 1:16:00.926
Some ofthese guys
were policed offthe battlefield.

1:16:00.995 --> 1:16:04.692
And ifthey weren't here,
they would probably be on the battlefield,

1:16:04.765 --> 1:16:06.858
killing American soldiers.

1:16:06.934 --> 1:16:11.530
They're here for a reason,
and it's ourjob to ensure that they stay here

1:16:11.605 --> 1:16:15.837
until such time as it's deemed
that they don't need to be here any longer.

1:16:16.277 --> 1:16:19.735
SMITH: Guantanamo is hiding the fact
that the really bad dudes,

1:16:19.813 --> 1:16:21.371
Mullah Omar and, ofcourse,
Osama bin Laden,

1:16:21.448 --> 1:16:23.575
have never been captured.

1:16:23.651 --> 1:16:28.315
So you have Guantanamo Bay as,
”Here are 750 really evil guys, ”

1:16:28.389 --> 1:16:31.017
as a PR stunt, effectively,

1:16:31.091 --> 1:16:34.151
to say, ”Look, we're really achieving
something in the war on terror. ”

1:16:55.883 --> 1:16:57.976
And that is the main entrance
to Camp X-Ray.

1:16:58.285 --> 1:17:00.913
It would be extremely difficult for anybody
to make an escape out of here.

1:17:03.390 --> 1:17:07.190
Each one is 8 by 8 by 8,
one individual per cell.

1:17:08.128 --> 1:17:10.289
If you remember the individuals
in orange jumpsuits,

1:17:10.364 --> 1:17:12.764
there's like three or four kneeling
facing that way,

1:17:12.833 --> 1:17:14.801
three or four kneeling facing that way.

1:17:14.868 --> 1:17:18.167
If you take a shot from right here,
you'll have the same image.

1:17:18.439 --> 1:17:21.272
And no detainee has ever died
at Gitmo, from anything.

1:17:21.342 --> 1:17:25.745
The docs will give you an update.
We've performed well over 100 surgeries...

1:17:25.813 --> 1:17:28.782
So, one good thing for them being here
is they are quite healthy,

1:17:28.882 --> 1:17:32.648
and they're getting everything fixed
that needs to get fixed.

1:17:38.692 --> 1:17:42.822
We've introduced some new sports type
activities here in Camp Four.

1:17:42.896 --> 1:17:45.626
We've recently built
this half basketball court,

1:17:45.699 --> 1:17:48.862
and off to the left ofthat,
you will see a soccer court.

1:17:48.936 --> 1:17:50.961
It is a privilege to live in Camp Four.

1:17:51.038 --> 1:17:54.838
They are compliant with the camp rules
in order to live here.

1:17:55.376 --> 1:17:58.812
And we have introduced things
like cake on Wednesday nights,

1:17:58.879 --> 1:18:02.337
Pepsi on Monday nights,
ice cream on Sunday nights.

1:18:02.416 --> 1:18:04.850
Let's go in and take a look at the bay.

1:18:04.918 --> 1:18:08.684
SMITH: On the bed they have
the so-called Cls, or comfort items,

1:18:08.756 --> 1:18:13.216
which include, like, atoothbrush,
but also include a game of checkers.

1:18:13.594 --> 1:18:16.085
And I did ask them, ”Who's my client
meant to play checkers with?

1:18:16.163 --> 1:18:19.030
”He's in solitary confinement by himself. ”

1:18:20.701 --> 1:18:23.829
INTERVIEWER: What is the problem
with the press photographing them,

1:18:23.904 --> 1:18:25.838
talking with them and observing them?

1:18:26.173 --> 1:18:29.472
The desire to not provide a platform

1:18:31.111 --> 1:18:36.014
to have the men we're holding
espouse a vile Islamic rhetoric.

1:18:51.131 --> 1:18:55.966
This is a tactic of AI-Qaeda.
A hunger strike to elicit media attention

1:18:57.338 --> 1:18:59.636
and to bring pressure
on the United States government.

1:18:59.707 --> 1:19:01.504
When these numbers went up significantly,

1:19:01.575 --> 1:19:04.043
you guys start talking about it,
you guys start asking about it,

1:19:04.111 --> 1:19:06.079
so they understand that.

1:19:06.847 --> 1:19:11.409
Camp Five is a 100-bed, maximum-security
segregation/interrogation facility.

1:19:12.052 --> 1:19:14.987
SMITH: If they're held in Camp Five,
an average day is always the same,

1:19:15.055 --> 1:19:19.424
which is, you're held 24 hours
in solitary confinement.

1:19:21.195 --> 1:19:23.891
Here in this cell,
it was eight foot by siX foot,

1:19:23.964 --> 1:19:27.695
and I couldn't physically take three steps
in any direction.

1:19:27.768 --> 1:19:30.862
I certainly believed that I was going
to spend the greater part of my life,

1:19:30.938 --> 1:19:35.034
and perhaps even face execution,
which was what I was told quite often.

1:19:35.342 --> 1:19:38.334
What's particularly pernicious
in Guantanamo Bay

1:19:38.412 --> 1:19:41.848
is there is no sense of
when it's gonna end, or if it's gonna end.

1:19:45.319 --> 1:19:47.116
and may starve themselves to death,

1:19:47.187 --> 1:19:49.621
is, in the words of Omar Deghayes,

1:19:49.690 --> 1:19:52.887
"I'm dying slowly here
in Guantanamo as it is.

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:55.155
"So I may as well take my life
into my own hands."

1:20:00.334 --> 1:20:03.098
HOOD: I have no intention
of holding somebody here

1:20:03.170 --> 1:20:05.570
any longer than
he is a threat to our country,

1:20:05.639 --> 1:20:07.766
or that he has intelligence or information

1:20:07.841 --> 1:20:10.207
that could be valuable to us
in the global war on terror.

1:20:10.644 --> 1:20:15.274
We continue to collect information of value
from the men we're holding today.

1:20:20.053 --> 1:20:21.611
BEGG.’ One of the reasons
why] was held in isolation

1:20:21.688 --> 1:20:25.852
was to do with this issue of
witnessing these deaths in Bagram.

1:20:26.493 --> 1:20:29.394
And they asked me which soldiers had been
involved and were around at that time,

1:20:29.463 --> 1:20:32.864
so they brought in photographs
of the people from the unit,

1:20:32.933 --> 1:20:35.868
and I pointed out
who I believed was involved.

1:20:37.104 --> 1:20:40.437
They asked me one of the strangest
requests I've ever had

1:20:40.507 --> 1:20:43.533
during the time l was in incarceration,
and that was,

1:20:43.610 --> 1:20:47.307
would I be willing to stand up
as a witness for the prosecution

1:20:47.381 --> 1:20:49.144
in a trial against these soldiers?

1:20:49.216 --> 1:20:51.343
And I thought how ironic this is, you know.

1:20:51.418 --> 1:20:54.046
"Is this the only court
that I'm going to get to see

1:20:54.121 --> 1:20:55.952
"after all these years in incarceration?"

1:21:04.465 --> 1:21:06.990
NARRA TOR: The cruel ironies
of the Dilawar story

1:21:07.067 --> 1:21:10.002
echoed an ongoing debate
in the halls of Congress

1:21:10.070 --> 1:21:14.302
about detainee abuse, national security
and the rule oflaw.

1:21:15.075 --> 1:21:18.977
For one senator, John McCain,
a former prisoner of war,

1:21:19.046 --> 1:21:23.005
the matter of detainee abuse
was both political and personal.

1:21:57.885 --> 1:22:02.788
CLOONAN.’ If this man, after six-and-a-half
or seven years of torture,

1:22:02.856 --> 1:22:04.517
says that it's not efficient,

1:22:05.826 --> 1:22:07.453
it's inhumane,

1:22:07.528 --> 1:22:11.123
and it breeds contempt
for the United States,

1:22:12.332 --> 1:22:16.234
he can stand up
and be a moral voice on this issue.

1:22:16.737 --> 1:22:20.002
We sent them to fight for us
in Afghanistan and Iraq,

1:22:20.073 --> 1:22:24.874
we placed extraordinary pressure on them
to extract intelligence from detainees.

1:22:25.445 --> 1:22:29.006
But then we threw out the rules
that our soldiers had trained on

1:22:29.082 --> 1:22:34.019
and replaced them with a confusing
and constantly changing array of standards.

1:22:34.588 --> 1:22:38.490
And when things went wrong,
we blamed them, and we punished them.

1:22:40.093 --> 1:22:42.493
[believe we have to do better than that.

1:22:44.565 --> 1:22:48.934
[strongly urge you to do justice
to your men and women in uniform.

1:22:49.670 --> 1:22:55.370
Give them clear standards ofconduct that
reflect the ideals they risk their lives for.

1:22:59.079 --> 1:23:01.309
NARRATOR.’ On October 5, 2005,

1:23:01.381 --> 1:23:05.112
as increasing numbers
of detainee abuse cases came to trial,

1:23:05.185 --> 1:23:08.677
Senator John McCain proposed
the Detainee Treatment Act.

1:23:10.357 --> 1:23:13.485
The bill sought a total U.S. ban on torture,

1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:17.018
as well as cruel, inhuman,
and degrading treatment.

1:23:17.097 --> 1:23:22.592
And it sparked a national debate,
one on which the devil was in the details.

1:23:23.303 --> 1:23:27.330
McCAIN: Is it still permissible to use
a wet towel and dripping water

1:23:27.407 --> 1:23:30.672
to induce the misperception of suffocation?

1:23:30.877 --> 1:23:34.938
The use ofthe wet towel, dripping water
to induce misperception of suffocation

1:23:35.015 --> 1:23:39.384
was one ofthe techniques
requested by the JTF

1:23:39.453 --> 1:23:41.318
in their laundry list given up.

1:23:41.388 --> 1:23:45.222
It was never approved.
It has never been a technique approved.

1:23:45.559 --> 1:23:47.686
One of the techniques
that made the transition

1:23:47.761 --> 1:23:50.889
from the regime ofthe physical
to the psychological,

1:23:50.964 --> 1:23:53.432
in fact, the only one, really,
was waterboarding.

1:23:53.634 --> 1:23:56.228
Because in the medieval era,
under the Inquisition,

1:23:56.303 --> 1:24:00.171
it was done because of
its horrible physical aspects.

1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:03.073
It was done to purge and punish the heretic.

1:24:03.510 --> 1:24:06.035
You force water
down the throat of the victim,

1:24:06.113 --> 1:24:09.173
the victim thinks that he's drowning.
It's horrible!

1:24:09.249 --> 1:24:11.945
Your body tells you that you're dying!

1:24:13.353 --> 1:24:18.381
Right after 9/11, the CIA got approval
from the White House for waterboarding.

1:24:19.459 --> 1:24:23.452
NARRA TOR: An early test case involved
the interrogation oflbn Sheikh al Libi,

1:24:23.530 --> 1:24:27.489
a man suspected ofbeing the emir
of an Al-Qaeda training camp.

1:24:28.335 --> 1:24:31.532
Initially, the FBI was in charge
of his interrogation,

1:24:31.605 --> 1:24:34.199
but the administration was impatient
with the slow results

1:24:34.274 --> 1:24:37.107
of the FBI's law enforcement techniques.

1:24:37.177 --> 1:24:40.112
So they turned al Libi over to the CIA.

1:24:40.180 --> 1:24:42.148
CLOONAN.’ He is secured.

1:24:42.215 --> 1:24:44.183
He was either duct-taped or hooded,

1:24:44.251 --> 1:24:49.120
and he was gonna be put into a box,
a plywood box, for his own protection,

1:24:50.457 --> 1:24:53.119
for transfer to the airport.

1:24:53.260 --> 1:24:54.386
They threw him on an aircraft

1:24:54.461 --> 1:24:58.397
and they rendered him, through
extraordinary rendition, to Egypt.

1:25:00.300 --> 1:25:03.929
They later subjected him
to two weeks of brutal torture

1:25:04.004 --> 1:25:07.496
involving all these techniques,
including waterboarding.

1:25:07.908 --> 1:25:10.172
And they got information from al Libi,

1:25:10.243 --> 1:25:13.906
stating that Saddam Hussein's regime
had trained AI-Qaeda

1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:16.346
in chemical and biological warfare.

1:25:17.017 --> 1:25:19.884
One of the things we know about torture

1:25:19.953 --> 1:25:25.414
is that someone who is tortured
will tell his interrogator

1:25:25.492 --> 1:25:28.893
what he thinks
the interrogator wants to hear.

1:25:29.763 --> 1:25:34.462
WILKERSON.’ The moment al Libi was
waterboarded, he started blurting things out.

1:25:34.534 --> 1:25:37.594
Well, rather than questioning
what he was saying

1:25:37.671 --> 1:25:41.664
and going into it in detail to see if what
he was saying could be corroborated,

1:25:41.742 --> 1:25:47.078
they immediately stopped and ran off
to report what al Libi had said,

1:25:47.147 --> 1:25:48.876
and ended the torture.

1:25:49.149 --> 1:25:51.777
And, bang, it gets up
to the highest decision-makers,

1:25:51.852 --> 1:25:53.683
and all ofa sudden, Colin Powell is told,

1:25:53.754 --> 1:25:56.689
”Hey, you don't have to worry
about your doubts anymore,

1:25:56.757 --> 1:25:58.622
”because we've just gotten confirmation

1:25:58.692 --> 1:26:02.219
”that there were contacts
between Al-Qaeda and Baghdad. ”

1:26:03.630 --> 1:26:08.226
NARRA TOR: In February, 2003,
then-Secretary of State Colin Powell

1:26:08.301 --> 1:26:09.598
went before the United Nations

1:26:09.669 --> 1:26:12.570
to make the case for the war in Iraq.

1:26:12.906 --> 1:26:16.740
I can trace the story
of a senior terrorist operative

1:26:16.810 --> 1:26:21.804
telling how Iraq provided training
in these weapons to AI-Qaeda.

1:26:21.882 --> 1:26:26.512
Fortunately, this operative is now detained,
and he has told his story.

1:26:27.621 --> 1:26:32.558
McCOY.' A year later, the CIA
branded al Libi a fabricator,

1:26:32.626 --> 1:26:36.687
rescinded all the intelligence reports
with that information in it.

1:26:36.930 --> 1:26:39.091
So, in other words, you will get information,

1:26:39.166 --> 1:26:40.997
but you'll get false information.

1:26:41.434 --> 1:26:46.235
I think Colin Powell has said that was
the most embarrassing day of his entire life.

1:26:50.477 --> 1:26:56.780
All the experts say that torturing people
is not the best way to get information.

1:26:57.684 --> 1:27:02.417
Breaking down the barriers
between you and them,

1:27:02.489 --> 1:27:03.751
gaining their confidence,

1:27:03.824 --> 1:27:05.883
is the best way to get it.

1:27:05.959 --> 1:27:09.827
It takes some experience. It takes
some talent. It takes some patience.

1:27:09.896 --> 1:27:13.423
And then they might actually tell you
something that is worthwhile.

1:27:13.834 --> 1:27:16.735
And then if you wanna prosecute them
and execute them, go ahead.

1:27:17.270 --> 1:27:20.171
You wanna be able to build
a rapport with somebody.

1:27:20.774 --> 1:27:22.332
You are their salvation.

1:27:22.409 --> 1:27:24.377
Because their life as they know it is over.

1:27:27.214 --> 1:27:30.706
"Is there something I can do for your kids?
You concerned about them?

1:27:30.917 --> 1:27:34.011
"You want them educated?
I'll get them educated.

1:27:35.055 --> 1:27:37.819
"What do you want? Tell me what you want.

1:27:38.258 --> 1:27:39.725
"Script for me

1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:41.527
"your eXit strategy.

1:27:41.595 --> 1:27:44.564
"How do you extricate yourself
from this terrible situation,

1:27:44.631 --> 1:27:47.361
"by the way, that you put yourself in?

1:27:48.201 --> 1:27:50.328
"Now, you can't go back home,

1:27:51.137 --> 1:27:52.195
"can you?

1:27:52.272 --> 1:27:53.796
"No. So, let's make peace with that.

1:27:53.874 --> 1:27:58.004
"Let me help you find a strategy
to give you a life."

1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:02.173
And that's the way it worked.

1:28:02.249 --> 1:28:07.551
The amount of information that
they were able to provide us, pre-9I11,

1:28:07.621 --> 1:28:10.385
to me, it was extremely valuable.

1:28:10.457 --> 1:28:15.121
Who else was gonna tell us
about how you joined AI-Qaeda?

1:28:19.032 --> 1:28:23.696
Did they use Inmarsat satellite phones?
Did bin Laden use a body double?

1:28:23.770 --> 1:28:28.469
So when we got all that information,
we were able to do certain operations.

1:28:29.009 --> 1:28:33.810
Cumbersome though it may be,
it still, to me, was the way to do it.

1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:36.974
And we don't have to apologize to anybody.

1:28:38.785 --> 1:28:42.016
We don't know what revenge
is coming down the road.

1:28:42.088 --> 1:28:44.989
And if] wanted to incite the faithful,

1:28:45.058 --> 1:28:49.358
I'd just take one picture
with a dog collar on, and just point to that,

1:28:49.429 --> 1:28:53.388
and look at the young brothers and say,
"You're duty-bound now to get revenge."

1:28:58.805 --> 1:29:03.208
McCOY.' The advocates of torture
generally focus on the hypothetical.

1:29:03.276 --> 1:29:05.744
They have this ticking bomb scenario
that they talk about.

1:29:05.812 --> 1:29:09.714
SMITH: Which is, ”Imagine that there's
a ticking time bomb in Times Square,

1:29:09.783 --> 1:29:14.186
"it's about to go off, we've got the guy
in custody, he says he wants a lawyer."

1:29:14.254 --> 1:29:16.381
You know, "Do we respect
his right to a lawyer

1:29:16.456 --> 1:29:20.688
"or, to save a million lives,
do we apply the electrodes to his testicles?"

1:29:26.866 --> 1:29:33.101
24, week after week,
has on-camera displays of brutal torture...

1:29:33.173 --> 1:29:35.368
Just tell me what's your connection
with the terrorists!

1:29:35.442 --> 1:29:38.673
...designed to stop some terrorist
with a ticking bomb

1:29:38.745 --> 1:29:41.805
from killing hundreds ofthousands,
if not millions, of Americans.

1:29:41.881 --> 1:29:43.542
You're talking about torturing this man?

1:29:43.616 --> 1:29:45.106
I'm talking about doing what is necessary

1:29:45.185 --> 1:29:47.449
to stop this warhead
from being used against us.

1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:49.511
It's just nonsense, though,
because then you ask,

1:29:49.589 --> 1:29:53.184
"Hey, name me one time in the last 500 years

1:29:53.259 --> 1:29:55.989
"when we've had someone in custody
with a ticking time bomb."

1:29:56.062 --> 1:29:59.589
The likelihood ofthat ever happening

1:30:00.133 --> 1:30:01.725
is so remote.

1:30:02.202 --> 1:30:06.036
Even if you're in that situation,
who's to say that, if you beat him up,

1:30:06.106 --> 1:30:07.869
that you're gonna get that information?

1:30:07.941 --> 1:30:12.105
If a guy's that committed,
I think he'll die before he gives it up.

1:30:12.579 --> 1:30:16.140
McCOY.' Right after the release
of the Abu Ghraib photos in mid-2004,

1:30:16.216 --> 1:30:18.616
35% ofAmericans polled

1:30:18.685 --> 1:30:21.654
believed that torture was acceptable
under some circumstances.

1:30:22.756 --> 1:30:25.088
Even after the Abu Ghraib photos.

1:30:25.158 --> 1:30:28.753
And I think that shows the way
that this kind of popular culture

1:30:28.828 --> 1:30:32.889
has built a constituency for torture
which allows the Bush White House

1:30:32.966 --> 1:30:37.164
to get away
with the way it twists laws and treaties,

1:30:37.237 --> 1:30:39.705
and doesn't spark popular outrage.

1:30:41.307 --> 1:30:43.366
NARRA TOR: On a conservative radio show,

1:30:43.443 --> 1:30:47.743
Vice President Dick Cheney openly
defended the practice of waterboarding.

1:30:48.581 --> 1:30:50.811
(HENNEN ON RECORDING)

1:30:52.252 --> 1:30:54.413
(CHENEY ON RECORDING)

1:31:01.728 --> 1:31:03.628
We do not condone torture.

1:31:03.863 --> 1:31:07.230
"We do not torture."
Footnote: "As we define torture,

1:31:07.300 --> 1:31:10.565
"which means exactly
what we wish it to mean and nothing else."

1:31:11.671 --> 1:31:13.901
NARRATOR.’ In the elections of 2006,

1:31:13.973 --> 1:31:17.238
the Bush administration openly
campaigned for harsh techniques

1:31:17.310 --> 1:31:20.074
the rest of the world defined as torture.

1:31:20.914 --> 1:31:24.475
Bush and Cheney played on the fears
of voters and politicians.

1:31:24.551 --> 1:31:28.715
If Congress didn't give them the power
to do whatever was necessary,

1:31:28.788 --> 1:31:30.881
how could Americans be safe?

1:31:31.558 --> 1:31:34.493
BUSH.’ In addition to the terrorists held
at Guantanamo,

1:31:34.561 --> 1:31:37.257
a small number of suspected terrorist
leaders and operatives

1:31:37.330 --> 1:31:42.199
captured during the war have been held
and questioned outside the United States

1:31:44.104 --> 1:31:47.870
in a separate program operated
by the Central Intelligence Agency.

1:31:49.742 --> 1:31:52.176
Some ask, ”Wh y are you acknowledging
this program now?”

1:31:53.780 --> 1:31:56.340
Some believe our military
and intelligence personnel

1:31:56.416 --> 1:31:59.351
involved in capturing
and questioning terrorists

1:32:00.153 --> 1:32:04.647
could now be at risk of prosecution
under the War Crimes Act

1:32:04.724 --> 1:32:08.626
simply for doing their jobs
in a thorough and professional way.

1:32:09.195 --> 1:32:10.958
This is unacceptable.

1:32:11.998 --> 1:32:16.094
NARRA TOR: The President was forced
to disclose his secret CIA program

1:32:16.169 --> 1:32:19.730
when the Supreme Court acted
to limit his wartime powers.

1:32:20.073 --> 1:32:22.041
In the historic Hamdan decision,

1:32:22.108 --> 1:32:25.805
the court ruled that interrogations
and trials of terrorists

1:32:25.879 --> 1:32:28.473
would be governed by
the Geneva Conventions.

1:32:29.015 --> 1:32:32.610
This debate is occurring
because ofthe Supreme Court's ruling

1:32:32.685 --> 1:32:35.813
that said that we must conduct ourselves

1:32:35.889 --> 1:32:39.416
under the Common Article 3
of the Geneva Convention.

1:32:41.161 --> 1:32:42.788
And that Common Article 3 says
that, you know,

1:32:42.862 --> 1:32:46.423
there will be no outrages
upon human dignity.

1:32:48.301 --> 1:32:50.769
That's, like... It's very vague.

1:32:50.837 --> 1:32:52.566
What does that mean?

1:32:57.477 --> 1:32:58.671
MAN: Do you believe that the use

1:32:58.745 --> 1:33:01.839
of testimony which is obtained
through techniques

1:33:01.915 --> 1:33:06.716
such as waterboarding, stress positions,
intimidating use of military dogs,

1:33:06.786 --> 1:33:09.812
sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation,
forced nudity,

1:33:09.889 --> 1:33:12.858
would be consistent
with Common Article 3?

1:33:14.093 --> 1:33:15.492
Well, sir, I think most importantly,

1:33:15.562 --> 1:33:19.123
I can't imagine that
such testimony would be reliable.

1:33:19.199 --> 1:33:21.360
Mr. Attorney General,
do you believe that statements obtained

1:33:21.434 --> 1:33:25.268
through illegal inhumane treatment
should be admissible?

1:33:38.084 --> 1:33:39.551
Senator, I...

1:33:42.555 --> 1:33:44.045
Well, again...

1:33:45.291 --> 1:33:46.519
I'll say this.

1:33:46.593 --> 1:33:50.393
The concern that I would have
about such a prohibition

1:33:50.463 --> 1:33:52.090
is, "What does it mean?
How do you define it?"

1:33:53.233 --> 1:33:55.463
NARRATOR.’ And who would define it?

1:33:55.535 --> 1:33:57.765
The Bush Administration
introduced a new law

1:33:57.837 --> 1:34:01.500
that would elude the restrictions
of the Supreme Court.

1:34:01.574 --> 1:34:05.738
WILKERSON.’ In a legal sense, I think,
they wanted to discard the Constitution

1:34:05.812 --> 1:34:07.143
and they wanted to write a new one.

1:34:07.213 --> 1:34:11.513
But you can't do that, so what you do is you
throw a new interpretation on the old one.

1:34:11.584 --> 1:34:15.076
And the new interpretation is,
the Executive, in wartime,

1:34:15.154 --> 1:34:18.248
and perhaps this war is gonna last forever,

1:34:18.324 --> 1:34:19.757
is all-powerful.

1:34:21.494 --> 1:34:24.759
NARRA TOR: Congress gave the President
most of what he wanted.

1:34:25.031 --> 1:34:27.829
He would agree to abide
by the Geneva Conventions,

1:34:27.900 --> 1:34:31.267
so long as he could define
their meaning and application.

1:34:32.472 --> 1:34:36.374
A few detainees at Guantanamo
might be put on trial,

1:34:36.442 --> 1:34:40.173
but the rest would no longer
have access to habeas corpus,

1:34:40.246 --> 1:34:43.807
the fundamental legal right
to challenge their detention.

1:34:46.586 --> 1:34:51.023
Planning a run for President,
even Senator McCain voted for the bill,

1:34:51.090 --> 1:34:54.059
soon after the Bush administration
threatened to discredit him

1:34:54.127 --> 1:34:55.856
with conservative voters.

1:34:57.397 --> 1:35:00.833
JACK CAFFERTY.’ Buried deep inside
this legislation is a provision

1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:04.802
that will pardon President Bush
and all the members ofhis administration

1:35:04.871 --> 1:35:09.638
of any possible crimes connected with
the torture and mistreatment of detainees,

1:35:09.709 --> 1:35:13.645
dated all the way back
to September 11, 2001.

1:35:13.713 --> 1:35:16.307
At least President Nixon had Gerald Ford
to do his dirty work.

1:35:16.382 --> 1:35:18.782
President Bush is trying to pardon himself.

1:35:20.887 --> 1:35:24.618
NARRATOR.’ The pardon did not extend
to frontline soldiers.

1:35:25.692 --> 1:35:29.924
The trial was a very confusing time for me,
'cause I'd never been through trial before,

1:35:29.996 --> 1:35:32.692
I didn't know what was really going on,

1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:36.664
I kind ofjust understood
that l was facing a lot oftime in jail.

1:35:36.736 --> 1:35:38.897
That's the only thing
I really understood about the whole thing.

1:35:42.642 --> 1:35:47.739
Well, l was sent to jail,
to a military correctional facility.

1:35:49.515 --> 1:35:51.745
l have lost my full-time job.

1:35:52.985 --> 1:35:55.545
l have a Bad Conduct Discharge,

1:35:55.621 --> 1:36:00.388
which has hindered me
in getting a newjob in the same field.

1:36:02.962 --> 1:36:04.156
l'v
e.

1:36:05.965 --> 1:36:08.229
Financially, it's just devastated me.

1:36:08.801 --> 1:36:11.929
I'm just glad it's over. That's it.
Glad I can get on with my life.

1:36:16.342 --> 1:36:19.743
WALLS.’ I had to plead guilty to assault

1:36:20.179 --> 1:36:23.546
and two counts ofdereliction ofduty.

1:36:23.616 --> 1:36:28.417
In exchange, they'd say that I could
go to jail for no more than four months.

1:36:29.989 --> 1:36:33.083
Rather than spend the money
that was being spent for that trial,

1:36:33.159 --> 1:36:35.753
I think it could have been better spent
in working on Army doctrine

1:36:35.828 --> 1:36:38.558
to make sure that other people
go into battle

1:36:39.065 --> 1:36:42.466
properly equipped, properly led,

1:36:42.535 --> 1:36:47.029
and with a full understanding as to what
their new roles and responsibilities are.

1:36:47.106 --> 1:36:49.301
(INAUDIBLE)

1:36:49.375 --> 1:36:53.471
CASSARA.’ When a detainee is abused,
or a detainee claims abuse,

1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:56.610
they want somebody to take the fall for it.

1:36:56.682 --> 1:37:01.085
And it's not gonna be the person
with eagles or stars on their shoulder.

1:37:01.621 --> 1:37:05.057
NARRA TOR: No officer was ever convicted
in the Dilawar case.

1:37:08.661 --> 1:37:11.824
Captain Carolyn Wood
was given a staffposition

1:37:11.898 --> 1:37:16.665
at the Army interrogation school
in Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

1:37:16.736 --> 1:37:22.732
HORTON: What does that reflect
in terms of senior Ieadership's intentions?

1:37:22.809 --> 1:37:25.835
Not to eradicate the abuse,

1:37:26.379 --> 1:37:29.348
but to perpetuate the abuse.

1:37:30.016 --> 1:37:32.951
I think the probabilities exist
that there will be other terrorist attacks,

1:37:33.019 --> 1:37:34.452
and more Americans will die.

1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:37.717
And the argument that we have
to apply abuse to detainees

1:37:37.790 --> 1:37:39.724
in order to protect American lives,

1:37:39.792 --> 1:37:42.761
I find to be violative of our deepest values

1:37:42.862 --> 1:37:45.490
and to the very safety of our country.

1:37:46.165 --> 1:37:49.328
We fight not only to protect lives,
we fight to protect our principles.

1:37:50.870 --> 1:37:54.465
LAGOURANIS.’ If you say, over the course
ofAfghanistan, Gitmo and Iraq,

1:37:54.540 --> 1:37:56.804
we've detained 50,000 people,

1:37:56.876 --> 1:37:58.844
I'd say less than 1% were terrorists.

1:38:06.953 --> 1:38:09.979
Were some of them insurgents? Probably.

1:38:10.056 --> 1:38:12.286
Were almost all of them,
in Iraq in particular,

1:38:12.358 --> 1:38:16.317
gonna become insurgents
after their treatment? Yes.

1:38:16.395 --> 1:38:19.887
l was kidnapped, abducted,
falsely imprisoned, tortured,

1:38:19.966 --> 1:38:24.335
and threatened with further torture,
without charge and without trial.

1:38:27.073 --> 1:38:29.268
Even many soldiers
had said to me afterwards,

1:38:29.475 --> 1:38:32.376
"Hell, if you weren't a terrorist
when you came in here,

1:38:32.512 --> 1:38:36.972
"by the time you leave, I'm sure you would
be because of the way you've been treated."

1:38:37.049 --> 1:38:39.142
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1:38:39.218 --> 1:38:42.619
CLOONAN.’ I think there's a certain level
of prejudice

1:38:42.688 --> 1:38:47.625
that this religion,
and the people who have hijacked it,

1:38:48.427 --> 1:38:51.123
have such a disregard for life

1:38:51.197 --> 1:38:55.327
that we turn around and say,
"If they think so very little of life,"

1:38:55.401 --> 1:38:58.393
and clearly 9I11 exemplified that,

1:38:58.938 --> 1:39:00.303
"screw them.

1:39:01.073 --> 1:39:02.734
"Anything goes."

1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:08.469
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1:39:57.096 --> 1:40:01.032
GOLDEN: It's not surprising that,
at the end ofall this,

1:40:01.667 --> 1:40:04.966
Dilawar, the victim, was really lost.

1:40:05.037 --> 1:40:08.165
I mean, Dilawar was almost invisible
in the trials.

1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:10.765
I mean, you never saw pictures of him,

1:40:10.843 --> 1:40:13.835
and nobody ever mentioned
this man's wife and child

1:40:13.913 --> 1:40:16.814
who were left without a husband and father.

1:40:17.550 --> 1:40:20.110
He was not part of the picture at all.

1:40:21.187 --> 1:40:23.246
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1:40:35.901 --> 1:40:41.737
GOLDEN: There's a lot of other people out
there who are gonna run into this system

1:40:41.807 --> 1:40:43.536
unless it's fixed.

1:40:43.609 --> 1:40:47.306
And you only need one
to sort of remind yourself

1:40:47.713 --> 1:40:49.704
of what it's capable of.

1:41:11.570 --> 1:41:15.233
McCOY.' American values are premised
upon the notion ofhuman dignity

1:41:15.307 --> 1:41:17.537
and the sanctity of the individual.

1:41:18.044 --> 1:41:23.175
To allow for cruelty to be applied
as a matter of official policy

1:41:23.249 --> 1:41:28.084
is to say that our forefathers were wrong
about these inalienable rights.

1:41:30.389 --> 1:41:32.118
LAGOURANIS.’ Americans obviously
want to believe

1:41:32.224 --> 1:41:34.988
that we're somehow more moral
than the rest of the world,

1:41:35.061 --> 1:41:38.121
that, for some reason, we have
a real strong desire to feel that way,

1:41:38.431 --> 1:41:43.494
and I think that's eroding, and I don't really
know what effect that's gonna have on us.

1:41:43.569 --> 1:41:47.471
And I think a lot of people have
just decided, "Well, you know,

1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:52.273
"it's different now after 9I11,
we can't be good anymore.

1:41:52.344 --> 1:41:54.335
"We have to, you know, get tough."

1:41:54.413 --> 1:41:57.246
And so we'll have to see
what that does to us.

1:41:57.316 --> 1:41:58.715
INTERVIEWER: What do you think?

1:41:58.784 --> 1:42:00.718
I think that's bullshit, frankly.

1:42:00.786 --> 1:42:07.350
I mean, I think that we still need to try
and be as good as we can be. You know?

1:42:21.607 --> 1:42:23.837
FRANK GIBNEY.’ I find it utterly
inconceivable

1:42:23.909 --> 1:42:28.676
that the highest officials,
Rumsfeld, Bush and Cheney,

1:42:28.748 --> 1:42:33.685
would not only countenance torture,
but would actually advocate it, period.

1:42:34.954 --> 1:42:38.481
It really destroyed my faith
in the American government.

1:42:39.024 --> 1:42:44.121
Because through World War II and
the Korean War, where I also served,

1:42:44.196 --> 1:42:47.859
we had the sense that we were
on the side ofthe good guys.

1:42:48.834 --> 1:42:52.167
You would always get justice
in the United States of America.

1:42:52.238 --> 1:42:55.071
People would get decent treatment.

1:42:55.141 --> 1:42:57.166
And there was a rule of law.

1:42:57.309 --> 1:42:59.004
We never forgot that,

1:42:59.311 --> 1:43:03.304
that behind the facade of wartime hatreds,

1:43:03.382 --> 1:43:08.342
there was a central rule of law
which people abided by.

1:43:09.488 --> 1:43:13.219
It was something we believed.
It was what made America different.
