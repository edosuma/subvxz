04:58.625 --> 05:02.000
These are some of the recordings
what David did under his instructions

05:02.125 --> 05:03.417
Before die.

05:04.958 --> 05:09.625
The facts seem clear.
But not the circumstances.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.917
I will help you in everything
whatever is in my hand.

05:13.667 --> 05:16.375
You must know that everything
what we are talking about here will be recorded.

05:16.958 --> 05:18.042
Of course.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.583
Please, say first
your full name.

05:23.708 --> 05:26.875
Robert Emett Friedhoff,
Doctor in Psychiatry.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.292
Let's start from the beginning.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.417
How did David get to you?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.042
David Jacobs was schizophrenic.

05:40.083 --> 05:45.083
That forced him to leave his job,
to get away from his family ...

05:46.958 --> 05:49.917
He began to feel observed,
pursued.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.625
I felt presences. I heard voices.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.292
Something consistent with his illness.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.458
The images that we have just seen

05:58.667 --> 06:02.333
they were to show you
that was the fruit of his imagination.

06:03.417 --> 06:07.833
That's why I asked him to record himself
with a camera for a few days.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.958
I understand that submitted
David to hypnosis.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.083
To a hypnotic regression, yes.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.542
It is a therapeutic technique.

06:18.042 --> 06:20.000
Consists in...
- I know what it is.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.833
What I want to know is what he intended.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.333
My intention was to push him back,
in your memories,

06:27.250 --> 06:29.292
at a time before his illness.

06:29.583 --> 06:32.708
That visualized how it was before.

06:38.750 --> 06:42.417
<i> Now that you are totally relaxed,
I want you to tell me </ i></i>

06:42.875 --> 06:47.750
<i> how was your life before you started
to feel those presences. </ i></i>

06:48.958 --> 06:51.792
<i> It's hard to imagine
I had another life, doctor. </ i></i>

06:52.042 --> 06:53.042
<i> Let's try it. </ i></i>

06:55.083 --> 06:56.625
<i> What were you doing? </ i></i>

06:57.167 --> 07:00.208
I had just started working.
- All right. With your father?

07:00.542 --> 07:03.250
Yes, in his office.

07:03.958 --> 07:05.167
Like worker intern.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Was that immediately before?
- More or less.

07:11.625 --> 07:14.125
Simply ... One day ...

07:15.292 --> 07:17.583
I started to notice
that there was something around me.

07:18.708 --> 07:19.750
With me.

07:21.417 --> 07:24.667
And where did that happen?
- In a basement.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.333
Tell me how it was.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.125
No, I do not know.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.208
I noticed ... a presence there.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.875
As if someone were watching me
from the darkness.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.833
Well, let's go back to your work.
You liked it?

07:52.833 --> 07:54.333
Did you like it, David?
- Do not.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.375
I did not like it.

07:58.250 --> 08:02.958
And why did you choose to study law?
- I did it for my father.

08:04.583 --> 08:07.042
He wanted me to continue
in the family business.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.917
I understand
But you did not want to be a lawyer.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.958
Did you tell him?
- Do not.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.083
why?

08:16.542 --> 08:20.542
I do not know. I suppose
I did not want to disappoint you.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.000
Do not you think your father
I would have understood

08:25.125 --> 08:26.625
What did you want to do?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.042
David, do you think your father ...?

08:35.542 --> 08:37.750
I see a dark room.

08:39.167 --> 08:40.667
I see a dark room.

08:42.332 --> 08:43.457
A bed...

08:45.208 --> 08:46.625
With a woman.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.208
Do you know where you are?

08:50.083 --> 08:51.083
Do not.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.417
It looks like a hospital.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.417
It's night.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.917
It's raining outside.

09:04.458 --> 09:05.792
There's a man,

09:06.875 --> 09:08.708
soaked by the rain.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.167
Is behind.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.250
He bends over the woman.

09:18.667 --> 09:19.667
Do not...

09:20.167 --> 09:23.042
I can not see the face. </ I>

09:24.708 --> 09:27.250
But he is telling you something.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.792
Can you hear what it says?

09:34.333 --> 09:36.083
He says he can not stand it anymore.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.625
The man separates from her.

09:45.958 --> 09:48.000
Take something out of your pocket.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.292
I can not...

09:55.083 --> 09:56.500
I can not see it.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.667
Is trembling.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.208
She grabs his hand.

10:05.625 --> 10:06.625
Voucher.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.208
OK, that's it.

10:10.542 --> 10:11.542
Take it easy.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.708
<i> Why did you interrupt the recording? </ i></i>

10:14.417 --> 10:18.167
<i> I already told you that my intention was
plunge David into positive memories, </ i></i>

10:18.292 --> 10:19.542
<i> that were useful. </ i></i>

10:19.833 --> 10:22.583
That was the opposite
of what I intended.

10:23.250 --> 10:26.792
And I decided to get him out of hypnosis.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.792
They talked again about what
David described in that hospital?

10:31.167 --> 10:32.167
Do not.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.417
Seeing how he reacted under hypnosis

10:34.542 --> 10:38.458
I valued that it was not positive
induce him again to another regression.

10:39.292 --> 10:40.292
So...

10:41.208 --> 10:43.208
I opted for other techniques.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.667
How to ask
that was recorded in video?

10:45.792 --> 10:49.042
Yes. And continue with the sessions
of therapy that I had with him.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.875
His intention was to dismantle
David's fantasy,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.042
teaching him these recordings that
you knew they lacked such

11:57.500 --> 11:58.875
presences
- So is.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.250
And you never saw the recordings?
- Never. Until today.

12:04.250 --> 12:08.125
Although I thank you
that he has not shown me his suicide.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.292
Tell me about David's illness.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.875
Schizophrenia is terrible,

12:14.292 --> 12:19.250
<i> because the voices, the hallucinations,
They are so real for the sick. </ i></i>

12:20.500 --> 12:23.375
<i> that can not distinguish them
of authentic reality. </ i></i>

12:34.958 --> 12:36.167
Hello Doctor.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.500
He does not belive me.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.333
I understand, it's your job.

12:45.083 --> 12:49.167
But what I see
and what I hear is real.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.917
I am recording it, as you requested.

12:57.625 --> 12:58.625
Before...

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Before everything was fine.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.375
Everything was

13:06.958 --> 13:08.208
on your site

13:11.125 --> 13:13.333
He says that everything has an explanation.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.750
But I'm going to show him no.

13:18.833 --> 13:20.083
He will see it.

13:21.417 --> 13:24.292
When he sees it, he will believe me.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.167
When I see it

13:30.417 --> 13:31.875
You will have to believe me.

13:51.042 --> 13:52.542
Where is?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.333
Where have I put it?

14:40.500 --> 14:43.000
I closed it some time ago
and I threw the keys

14:43.125 --> 14:44.958
to never have to enter again.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.250
That was the first time.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.750
What do you want of me?

16:23.708 --> 16:25.625
Why are you doing this to me?

16:34.875 --> 16:36.583
Fuck. Shit.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.125
<i> What do you want from me? </ i></i>

17:07.083 --> 17:08.916
<i> Why are you doing this to me? </ i></i>

17:14.416 --> 17:15.833
<i> What do you want from me? </ i></i>

17:18.708 --> 17:20.500
<i> Why are you doing this to me? </ i></i>

17:39.250 --> 17:41.792
Did you give the idea
of trying to record psychophonies?

17:42.500 --> 17:45.792
I am a doctor.
I would never suggest something like that.

17:46.625 --> 17:49.542
I just wanted to
to record his daily routine.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.833
And David did not tell him?

17:53.792 --> 17:56.333
Yes. And I discouraged it.

17:56.917 --> 17:57.708
why?

17:57.833 --> 18:01.708
Because it is easy to suggest
with that kind of practice.

18:02.792 --> 18:05.083
You end up hearing what you want to hear.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.750
You can believe that a simple noise

18:07.875 --> 18:10.333
it's a voice
who tries to communicate with him.

18:11.042 --> 18:12.708
That can increase the delirium.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.667
Something undesirable
in the case of a schizophrenic.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.042
Of course.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.667
Sorry.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.958
I'm sorry, Mom.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.667
I'm sorry dad.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.500
LIST OF ENCHANTED PLACES
FROM NEW YORK

19:36.750 --> 19:40.750
THE PSYCHOPHONES
AND THE ELECTRONIC voice PHENOMENON

19:43.083 --> 19:47.208
<i> Any quackery
parapsychological that fell into their hands </ i></i>

19:48.125 --> 19:49.292
<i> I took it to the letter. </ i></i>

19:49.583 --> 19:52.375
How could it affect you
the lack of medication?

19:53.417 --> 19:57.125
Most of it only serves
to decrease mental activity.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.958
The deliriums
They are part of the thought.

20:00.083 --> 20:04.333
Of an altered thought.
- Is not there an effective treatment?

20:04.458 --> 20:07.250
No. You can only
palliate the disease.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.500
But cure it ...

20:10.542 --> 20:13.708
His case was peculiar:
undifferentiated schizophrenia,

20:14.042 --> 20:16.833
that's what it's called
when its origin is not known.

20:19.292 --> 20:23.292
The voices in his head did not give him
mandates, which is the usual.

20:24.042 --> 20:26.542
He was threatened,
they had him subdued,

20:27.125 --> 20:29.417
They caused him a lot of fear.

20:30.417 --> 20:31.417
Afraid of what?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.417
To something that terrified him,

20:41.917 --> 20:45.292
but he was never able
to explain myself clearly.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.917
There is something inside my house.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.417
I have to face it.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.292
Is not that right, doctor?

23:46.458 --> 23:48.167
<i> Was he trying to record a ghost? </ i></i>

23:49.833 --> 23:51.167
<i> A psycho image. </ i></i>

23:51.292 --> 23:54.333
<i> It is believed that they are easier
to get in places ... </ i></i>

23:54.458 --> 23:56.792
<i> let's say, of psychic activity. </ i></i>

23:58.625 --> 24:02.333
<i> Although I repeat that I
I do not believe in those phenomena. </ i></i>

24:04.250 --> 24:05.458
<i> No, of course. </ i></i>

24:06.875 --> 24:08.208
<i> You are a scientist. </ i></i>

24:42.167 --> 24:43.167
«Kate».

25:03.208 --> 25:05.417
Does the name Kate tell you something?

25:07.583 --> 25:09.667
Do not.
- Any friend, girlfriend ...

25:09.792 --> 25:11.458
family, neighbor ...?

25:12.542 --> 25:14.542
Do you know who the basement belonged to?

25:15.833 --> 25:18.583
David told me that he lived alone
for a long time.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.083
I suppose that
It would be the house where he grew up.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.750
Do not you think something strange
what happened?

25:27.500 --> 25:30.625
The schizophrenics become obsessed
often with places or objects.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.500
I'm not surprised.

25:35.042 --> 25:36.042
I was referring to this.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.167
What do you want me to say?

25:42.417 --> 25:45.375
A rise in tension,
an old television ...

25:46.875 --> 25:48.667
I do not see where he wants to go.

26:04.958 --> 26:06.250
Containing?

26:06.833 --> 26:10.000
Believe me, you will not like to know.

27:11.458 --> 27:12.500
Marty?

27:18.625 --> 27:19.625
Marty?

27:27.708 --> 27:28.833
Marty!

27:41.125 --> 27:42.125
Marty!

28:15.375 --> 28:16.458
Hello?

28:21.167 --> 28:22.208
Hello?

28:24.833 --> 28:26.292
Need help?

28:28.625 --> 28:31.083
Get out of here! Outside!

28:31.375 --> 28:32.625
Long!

28:33.583 --> 28:34.667
Joden

28:39.333 --> 28:40.375
Marty!

28:44.167 --> 28:45.167
Hey ...

28:50.083 --> 28:51.625
What are you doing there?

28:59.250 --> 29:00.250
Go

29:06.958 --> 29:08.667
I know you wanted to see me.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.333
Are you going to get out of there?

29:15.667 --> 29:17.292
No, I am not ok.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.917
I'm going to the psychiatrist.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.750
I have stopped the medication.

29:25.417 --> 29:26.917
I guess you're right.

29:27.958 --> 29:29.958
That's why I came. Yes again.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.500
He's following me.
It does not leave me alone.

29:35.792 --> 29:37.833
Of course I'm sure, Marty.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.625
What the hell are you doing there?

29:42.583 --> 29:43.958
I've missed you, uncle.

29:48.167 --> 29:49.250
<i> And how ...? </ i></i>

29:50.708 --> 29:51.792
How are you?

29:53.917 --> 29:54.917
So bad?

29:56.625 --> 29:57.625
Sorry.

30:02.083 --> 30:05.708
But that...
No, I will not do it!

30:06.083 --> 30:08.250
There has to be another solution.

30:09.542 --> 30:13.500
I do not want to talk about this anymore!
Seriously.

30:15.500 --> 30:19.333
Are you going to leave once or not?
You had something important to tell me.

30:24.125 --> 30:25.208
As you like.

30:38.208 --> 30:39.458
Are you hungry?

30:40.417 --> 30:44.750
I do. I'm going for some food.
I'm not late, okay?

30:55.333 --> 30:57.542
<i> Who were you looking for in that hospital? </ i></i>

30:59.625 --> 31:00.708
Maybe a friend.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.708
You never mentioned
the name of Martin Walker?

31:04.083 --> 31:06.458
No, never that I remember.

31:07.708 --> 31:08.875
Martin died a year ago

31:09.000 --> 31:11.500
in the hospital where he entered
for a car accident.

31:12.792 --> 31:15.083
One day, there was a fire
While sleeping.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.792
The case ended up being filed
like a short circuit.

31:19.958 --> 31:23.125
That event, among other things,
He took the hospital to bankruptcy.

31:24.625 --> 31:28.208
As you have imagined,
Martin was David's friend.

31:30.417 --> 31:31.917
In fact, his best friend.

31:33.958 --> 31:36.583
I'm surprised that your patient
I will not mention it.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.208
This rice is delicious.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.375
Very tasty.

32:07.833 --> 32:11.417
Well, I do not know what's wrong with you,
but I'm going to have to leave.

32:12.750 --> 32:13.917
What do you mean?

32:15.125 --> 32:16.708
What do you mean?

32:17.708 --> 32:19.208
I'm not going to do that, Marty.

32:19.625 --> 32:22.208
Look, if you have
something to tell me, tell me!

32:22.875 --> 32:23.917
Voucher?

32:24.583 --> 32:26.500
But stop fucking me.

32:29.125 --> 32:31.917
Hey what are you doing?
What are you doing?

32:34.292 --> 32:36.000
I should not have come.

32:43.333 --> 32:47.125
What do you do? Let me! Let me!

32:47.875 --> 32:50.958
Why are you doing this? Why?

33:09.708 --> 33:13.208
Doctor, as an expert, what do you think
What happened at that hospital?

33:13.667 --> 33:16.208
David was reviving
some previous situation.

33:17.708 --> 33:21.958
Or composing a kind
of memories puzzle.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.750
Connecting them in your mind.

33:25.625 --> 33:30.167
But they could also intermingle
with new unconscious wishes.

33:30.292 --> 33:32.167
How to see your friend Martin again.

33:34.417 --> 33:37.875
What is clear is that it arrived
to such a state of suggestion,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.125
that his body reacted
with that enormous tension.

33:42.417 --> 33:46.375
Are you telling me that David
I was not pretending?

33:46.917 --> 33:48.458
Of course
I was not pretending.

33:49.417 --> 33:51.250
He lived it as something real.

33:52.083 --> 33:54.958
He felt that someone
I was grabbing and pushing him,

33:55.292 --> 33:56.833
beyond
of your reaction capacity.

33:59.083 --> 34:02.083
I understand that, for those who do not live together
with mental illness,

34:02.250 --> 34:04.130
these reactions
be very difficult to understand.

34:40.458 --> 34:45.292
<i> Do you consider normal what David recorded
later in your bathroom? </ i></i>

34:46.167 --> 34:48.750
<i> It is frequent that
the schizophrenic self-harm. </ i></i>

34:52.333 --> 34:54.667
<i> Doctor, the brand that shows
in his left arm </ i></i>

34:54.792 --> 34:56.792
<i> corresponds
with the one with the left hand. </ i></i>

34:57.000 --> 34:59.917
<i> He could not hold on
with his own left hand. </ i></i>

35:07.333 --> 35:09.250
Do you think Martin was real?

35:10.083 --> 35:11.583
I have not said that.

35:15.375 --> 35:18.083
It must be a mistake
of interpretation of the marks.

35:19.375 --> 35:22.292
Or something much less common,
but also possible

35:22.417 --> 35:23.917
and studied by Psychiatry.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.167
Illustrate me, please.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.125
That those marks were produced
for psychosomatic cause.

35:29.917 --> 35:31.792
How the stigmas?
- Exactly.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.125
Under certain circumstances,

35:34.250 --> 35:37.208
the mind is capable of inducing
effects on the body.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.167
Physical effects

35:39.792 --> 35:42.875
Formerly they were called
miracles or witchcraft.

35:43.917 --> 35:46.958
Today we know that is not so.
- And the causes?

35:47.167 --> 35:49.292
The causes are unknown.

35:50.792 --> 35:53.500
David did not realize
that there was nobody there?

35:53.875 --> 35:55.042
I do not think so.

35:56.083 --> 35:57.458
Martin was trying

35:58.167 --> 36:02.500
as someone alive, present, real.

36:04.625 --> 36:08.167
What I have trouble understanding
It is what he intended.

36:09.292 --> 36:12.292
What was that about what
I did not want to talk to Martin ...?

36:12.417 --> 36:13.583
Doctor...

36:16.875 --> 36:18.417
What do you think about the guilt?

36:19.500 --> 36:20.583
What do you mean?

36:20.708 --> 36:22.684
Is there any possibility
that David felt

36:22.708 --> 36:24.750
guilty for the loss of your friend?

36:26.375 --> 36:29.208
I do not think so.
I rather missed it.

36:30.333 --> 36:33.625
A person who feels guilty
he becomes his own executioner.

36:36.667 --> 36:37.667
Seneca

36:41.500 --> 36:45.125
Apart from hypnosis, you
He recorded all his sessions with David.

36:46.042 --> 36:49.333
It is used as a record for
Complete the patient's history.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.292
It's the same thing that you do,
recording the interrogations.

36:56.417 --> 36:58.083
This is not an interrogation.

37:00.625 --> 37:02.250
<i> Have you slept something today? </ i></i>

37:03.208 --> 37:05.583
<i> Yes. A couple of hours. </ I></i>

37:06.833 --> 37:08.958
<i> Then I woke up and ...
- And? </ I></i>

37:09.500 --> 37:11.167
<i> I have not been able to go back to sleep. </ i></i>

37:11.667 --> 37:12.750
<i> The voices ... </ i></i>

37:13.417 --> 37:16.167
<i> Have they talked to you again?
- Yes. </ I></i>

37:18.042 --> 37:20.792
<i> They tell me to stay away from her. </ i></i>

37:21.958 --> 37:23.250
<i> If I do not ... </ i></i>

37:26.250 --> 37:28.458
something horrible is going to happen. </ i>

37:33.375 --> 37:34.750
Who did he mean?

37:34.958 --> 37:36.000
I do not know.

37:36.750 --> 37:41.667
He mentioned a couple of times
to a woman, without giving more details.

37:42.875 --> 37:48.125
He told me that he knew everything about him,
that he knew his darkest secrets.

37:49.708 --> 37:53.333
I thought it was just another fruit
of his schizoid disorder.

37:58.458 --> 37:59.958
It's the first time I'm here.

38:00.333 --> 38:04.292
I have never been to this bar.
I do not like bars.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.500
So, how can I know

38:08.625 --> 38:11.208
who is about to arrive
A brunette girl named Kate?

38:11.583 --> 38:12.750
How can I know that?

38:29.292 --> 38:30.292
It's her.

38:32.708 --> 38:33.708
It's her.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.500
It's her, doctor!

38:57.417 --> 38:59.292
I told him. I am not crazy.

39:11.625 --> 39:14.417
And David did not tell him
What I thought to do?

39:15.875 --> 39:18.292
I would like you to understand
that the sick

39:18.417 --> 39:22.125
create a parallel reality
in which everything fits for him.

39:23.625 --> 39:26.917
He is unable to distinguish
time and places.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.167
It can even generate
false memories,

39:29.875 --> 39:33.917
that he considers absolutely real
and incorporates them into your life,

39:34.042 --> 39:36.125
although the logic
tell you that they are impossible.

39:36.542 --> 39:42.042
And an expert like you, is not <i> able </ i>
to discern the real of fantasy?</i>

39:44.083 --> 39:46.333
An expert, as you say,

39:47.667 --> 39:49.083
It can detect if someone is lying.

39:50.625 --> 39:54.625
But when a patient speaks
of himself and remembers his memories,

39:55.708 --> 39:56.875
does not lie.

39:58.792 --> 39:59.958
Tells the truth.

40:01.167 --> 40:02.208
Its true

40:02.792 --> 40:05.917
Not even a polygraph
It would be <i> able </ i> to distinguish it.</i>

40:06.667 --> 40:09.500
And if the patient can generate
a false memory,

40:10.875 --> 40:12.583
Could you erase a real one?

40:21.708 --> 40:22.708
Could be.

40:23.333 --> 40:27.542
<i> A schizophrenic can believe
that anyone is the devil. </ i></i>

40:29.000 --> 40:33.542
<i> That's why, if you do not treat them on time,
They can become very dangerous. </ i></i>

40:44.583 --> 40:46.750
Come, another one just in case.

40:46.875 --> 40:49.458
Come on, put it here.
- Come on.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.083
Do you know what secrets
was David referring?

40:53.208 --> 40:56.417
Those like that Kate?
supposedly knew?

40:57.125 --> 40:58.125
Do not.

40:58.875 --> 41:01.917
As I said,
He only told me that a woman

41:02.042 --> 41:03.792
He claimed to know his secrets.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.208
<i> Nothing else. </ i></i>

41:05.500 --> 41:08.333
And it did not seem important
deepen in it?

41:08.708 --> 41:11.500
I tried, but he refused
to talk about that topic.

41:12.375 --> 41:14.875
It is not advisable to press
too much to the patients.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.458
It is necessary, vital, to trace
a line that should never be crossed.

41:33.917 --> 41:35.250
Excuse me a moment.

42:00.083 --> 42:05.042
Do you want to explain to me what the hell is there
in that can and where did it come from?

42:07.542 --> 42:08.708
It's a test?

42:17.583 --> 42:20.667
Special agent Maia Kensington.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.708
Sounds good.

42:24.125 --> 42:28.208
They tell you from above that
is someone key to the investigation

42:28.583 --> 42:32.333
and that you must give him full access.
And means.

42:34.500 --> 42:39.000
And you fuck
because this is your police station,

42:39.125 --> 42:41.542
they are your men
and he is your suspect.

42:41.958 --> 42:43.208
But you do not have another one.

42:48.583 --> 42:53.625
Look, we have never faced each other
to a case like this, okay?

42:54.750 --> 42:57.417
At least he could share
the information you have.

43:00.750 --> 43:04.583
And the truth is
that if you start investigating

43:04.875 --> 43:09.417
there is nothing about any
Special agent Maia Kensington.

43:10.583 --> 43:13.292
Encrypted reports, rumors ...

43:14.375 --> 43:17.708
You are very ethereal, Maia.

43:20.542 --> 43:21.958
But I will tell you something.

43:24.500 --> 43:27.375
I do not give a shit about all his power

43:27.583 --> 43:29.958
and that of those who send it here.

43:31.208 --> 43:32.375
Fuck you.

43:33.750 --> 43:36.208
I am God in this commissary.

43:37.792 --> 43:39.708
I will tell you what we are going to do.

43:41.375 --> 43:43.667
I'm going to give you some time
with his friend.

43:44.083 --> 43:45.542
Let's say thirty minutes.

43:46.417 --> 43:48.750
Be quick, finish your work,

43:48.875 --> 43:52.250
leave that can on the table
and then get out.

43:55.083 --> 43:56.917
Have you heard what I said?

44:03.500 --> 44:07.208
Commissioner Taylor,
thirty minutes will be enough.

44:18.167 --> 44:19.250
God!

44:28.250 --> 44:29.667
Let's continue with Kate.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.583
Come, let's change.

44:33.958 --> 44:37.667
Stop following me!
Why are you doing this to me?

44:37.792 --> 44:39.875
Come on, man ...
- Why are you doing this to me?

44:40.167 --> 44:42.208
Do not follow me!
- Come on, man ...

44:42.333 --> 44:43.833
You are a wretch!
- Go home.

44:43.958 --> 44:46.250
You do not have to do this to me!
- Go home.

44:46.458 --> 44:47.583
Get out!

44:49.083 --> 44:52.167
Leave, please.
- Why are you doing this? Leave me alone!

44:52.292 --> 44:53.500
Go away.

44:59.375 --> 45:03.792
<i> Maybe I should be alarmed,
but he had no clear reasons. </ i></i>

45:05.042 --> 45:08.042
<i> Who could think
that this was going to happen? </ i></i>

45:09.417 --> 45:11.333
<i> Well, you were his psychiatrist. </ i></i>

45:12.250 --> 45:15.250
<i> Psychiatry
it's not an exact science. </ i></i>

45:20.417 --> 45:22.917
Leave me Please, leave me.

45:23.167 --> 45:25.000
Please, leave me, please.

45:43.042 --> 45:46.667
Doctor, sorry I did not record
nothing more yesterday night.

45:46.875 --> 45:49.000
I needed to think.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.292
I needed to be alone.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.708
I'm going to buy something to drink.

45:55.917 --> 45:57.083
Do not leave.

46:17.958 --> 46:19.833
No no no.

46:22.458 --> 46:23.875
I need to go to the bathroom.

46:25.083 --> 46:27.708
Now that this gets interesting?
- Yes, now.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.500
I could even go to the bathroom
of my house if I wanted,

46:33.750 --> 46:35.958
since I'm not stopped, right?

46:41.708 --> 46:42.708
Doctor.

46:57.833 --> 47:01.500
Look, I'm just trying to help
in everything I can.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.375
<i> Agent Kensington, </ i></i>

47:18.500 --> 47:20.860
<i> would you be so kind to share
with me what do you think? '</ i></i>

47:21.458 --> 47:23.250
That he wants to piss.

48:29.292 --> 48:31.167
The security camera
of the store.

49:11.292 --> 49:13.792
This one is from David's camera.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.333
The young woman at the bar.

49:17.542 --> 49:18.958
They are the same person.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.667
Kate Grant.

49:23.292 --> 49:24.958
His girlfriend for four years.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.542
David, Kate and Martin knew each other.

49:36.792 --> 49:39.000
Did he forget about her, like that, without more?

49:39.833 --> 49:43.500
I already told you that it is totally
consistent with his illness.

49:45.208 --> 49:50.375
He was able to follow it and have
created the idea that it was the other way around,

49:50.833 --> 49:52.792
that she was the one who followed him.

49:57.583 --> 49:59.167
It's not going badly.

52:00.917 --> 52:02.583
I can not stand it anymore.

52:03.625 --> 52:05.042
You wanted it, doctor.

52:05.625 --> 52:07.500
You have asked me for it.

52:53.625 --> 52:57.875
I do not want to hurt you.
I just want you to tell the truth.

53:01.917 --> 53:02.917
Your...

53:05.292 --> 53:06.708
Marty told me ...

53:07.500 --> 53:08.667
He told me that...

53:10.708 --> 53:11.917
Fuck

53:14.500 --> 53:16.750
You have to tell the truth!

53:17.125 --> 53:19.083
I have to prove
I'm not crazy

53:23.250 --> 53:25.458
All this
It's Robert's fault. You know.

53:48.458 --> 53:49.875
You will speak.

53:57.125 --> 53:59.417
How do you explain
What happened in that basement?

54:00.125 --> 54:02.250
I'm sorry, but I have no explanation.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.833
You allowed this to happen.

54:05.792 --> 54:08.625
I could not know
I was going to do something like that.

54:57.125 --> 54:59.583
«You wanted it, doctor.
You have asked me for it ».

55:00.875 --> 55:03.458
But he is referring
I asked him to record himself,

55:03.583 --> 55:05.083
not to kidnap anyone.

55:06.333 --> 55:08.750
I do not understand why David
He said it was my fault.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.583
I did not know anything about ...!
- It does not mean you.

55:17.042 --> 55:18.208
What does it mean?

55:21.250 --> 55:22.250
Doctor,

55:23.458 --> 55:26.292
understand that here
I ask the questions.

55:31.667 --> 55:33.208
Focus on the notebook.

55:43.958 --> 55:45.208
But what...?

55:46.708 --> 55:49.125
Why did David call him
an hour after what happened?

56:16.250 --> 56:17.542
Doctor,

56:18.833 --> 56:20.792
I only have one thing left to do.

56:25.208 --> 56:26.833
Thanks for trying to help me.

56:34.917 --> 56:37.292
I guess I would not have
Who to call

56:38.375 --> 56:40.125
His tone alarmed me.

56:40.333 --> 56:43.208
It was of pain and acceptance.

56:43.917 --> 56:46.667
I was afraid I could ...
- What could he do?

56:47.208 --> 56:49.208
That he would try to end his life.

57:01.792 --> 57:03.250
<i> For the first time, </ i></i>

57:03.500 --> 57:07.167
<i> seemed about to admit
that he was seriously ill. </ i></i>

57:27.000 --> 57:29.042
Could someone bring me water,
please?

57:31.625 --> 57:32.833
Fifteen minutes.

57:34.208 --> 57:35.208
How?

57:35.458 --> 57:37.375
It's the time they leave me with you.

57:37.958 --> 57:39.958
It's little, but it's what I have.

57:40.875 --> 57:42.167
I would like to go more slowly,

57:42.292 --> 57:44.708
but you have to start
to be honest with me

57:49.125 --> 57:52.042
He said he tried with David before
other treatments

57:54.167 --> 57:56.083
What did he mean?

58:02.583 --> 58:04.542
They have found drugs
in your query.

58:08.250 --> 58:09.292
Doctor?

58:18.958 --> 58:20.958
I did everything I could to help him.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.958
There are radical methods.

58:28.208 --> 58:30.292
In addition to deep hypnosis,

58:31.417 --> 58:33.542
they involve the use of drugs.

58:35.708 --> 58:38.375
But ... that did not work either.

58:55.875 --> 58:57.583
But what...?

59:59.333 --> 01:00:02.167
NO, no, no "J

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:05.000
<i> When he runs, there's a moment
in which your camera recorded something. </ i></i>

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:07.500
<i> You can barely see it. </ i></i>

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:37.042
<i> They look like fingers.
- They look like. </ I></i>

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.083
But it could be anything.

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:45.125
A branch, a shadow ...

01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:50.500
In Psychiatry, that's what it's called
«Pareidolic illusion».

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.292
Like when we think we see
a <i> face </ i> in a cloud</i>

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:56.833
or a rock shaped like an animal.
- Maybe.

01:01:58.458 --> 01:02:01.833
And this too
Can it be one of those illusions?

01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:59.125
I will bring your water.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.292
This is what David found
in that forest.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.708
What do you think?

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.583
They look like human remains.

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:41.792
Male, approximately three years old,

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:44.375
died for violent cause.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.625
He had been buried for perhaps a year.

01:03:49.542 --> 01:03:52.583
Your DNA corresponds
with Kate's.

01:03:58.833 --> 01:04:00.208
That boy was Robert.

01:04:01.125 --> 01:04:02.292
Your son.

01:04:04.167 --> 01:04:05.542
David was the father?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Do not.

01:04:07.625 --> 01:04:10.250
His father was the young man who died
in the fire of that hospital.

01:04:11.292 --> 01:04:13.500
Martin Walker, his best friend.

01:04:15.042 --> 01:04:18.875
Not only was the body found.
Next to him was an object.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.917
It is about the weapon of crime.

01:04:23.542 --> 01:04:26.250
In it they found
epithelial cells of David.

01:04:27.917 --> 01:04:29.083
He could...

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:32.167
He was removing the earth.

01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:34.750
He dug up the body.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:37.239
Its epithelial are the same
antiquity than the remains.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:40.958
David wielded that gun
before being buried.

01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:46.208
Your patient killed
to an innocent and helpless child.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:53.375
In David's basement, they found
remains of dried blood of the child.

01:04:54.708 --> 01:04:56.875
After that door that never opened
in his recordings.

01:04:57.292 --> 01:04:59.375
I imagine that he killed him there

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.833
and then moved the body
to the forest to bury it.

01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:07.625
We found Kate
inside the basement closet.

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:11.792
Dead?
- That's what David believed.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.375
He is recovering in the hospital.

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:25.042
I was behind that basement door.

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:29.625
"Dear David:
I write you this letter

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:33.125
why do not you answer my calls
and I can not communicate with you ».

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:37.083
<i> Not even your father wants to talk
with me or tell me where you are. </ i></i>

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:38.958
<i> He never accepted me. </ i></i>

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.667
<i> I did not want you to find out like that. </ i></i>

01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:45.167
<i> I asked Marty
that he was not the one to tell you. </ i></i>

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.208
<i> I wanted to do it. </ i></i>

01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:51.167
<i> Robert is your son,
maybe not biologically, </ i></i>

01:05:51.792 --> 01:05:55.208
<i> but you raised him
and you have loved it as if it were yours. </ i></i>

01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:58.333
<i> Mine with Marty was a mistake. </ i></i>

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.750
«I do not know if you'll get to read
this letter, but if you do,

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.042
I hope you can forgive me.

01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:05.917
Kate ».

01:06:09.292 --> 01:06:13.708
According to the date, Kate sent him
This <i> letter </ i> to David a year ago.</i>

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.917
Shortly before everything happened.

01:06:20.417 --> 01:06:23.000
It could be what he did
to loose your mind.

01:06:28.083 --> 01:06:29.542
In that we agree.

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:33.042
When was the last time
who saw David?

01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:38.917
The day before his suicide.

01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:08.583
Hi.

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:10.625
Yes.

01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:14.417
Morning? In agreement.

01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:34.625
He had not known about him for several days.

01:08:35.457 --> 01:08:38.250
He reassured me that he agreed to see me.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.542
Although he did not teach me
what he had recorded.

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:47.332
And not even then did he comment
nothing he had done

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:50.042
or what he planned to do?
- Do not.

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:53.707
I proposed
a new therapy session,

01:08:54.332 --> 01:08:55.417
but he refused.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:57.875
They just talked?
- Yes

01:08:58.042 --> 01:09:00.582
We talked a few minutes and left.

01:09:00.707 --> 01:09:03.917
Why did not he record the latter
conversation in your office?

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:09.207
I was very upset.
He did not even enter.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.125
I did not deem it convenient.

01:09:16.292 --> 01:09:17.292
judge?

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:33.667
Why is he lying?
We have almost no time left.

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:46.917
Hi, David, thanks for coming.

01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:49.292
Doctor, I need to tell you something.
- Pass.

01:09:49.457 --> 01:09:51.207
I know I did something terrible.

01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:53.917
And those voices
They told me about you, doctor.

01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:55.792
From my?
- And from my father.

01:09:55.917 --> 01:09:57.625
About you and my father.

01:09:58.667 --> 01:09:59.958
Something is going to happen.

01:10:00.208 --> 01:10:01.542
Do not worry.

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:03.833
Do not worry, I'm going to help you.

01:10:03.958 --> 01:10:07.250
For this I need that we make
a new session of hypnosis.

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:09.458
Please sit. Sit down.

01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:11.792
Something simple. Voucher?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.125
Very easy.

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:20.333
No no no!
Doctor, no, please.

01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:22.792
No, the last time ...
- David...

01:10:23.292 --> 01:10:25.750
That was different. Trust me.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.000
Trust me, David.

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:30.458
All right.

01:10:31.083 --> 01:10:33.375
Leave me, let's see. Go for it.

01:10:33.708 --> 01:10:35.125
Well, okay.

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:40.333
I want you to listen to me carefully.

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:42.500
Close your eyes.

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:50.792
Tell me about that woman you saw
in that hospital room.

01:10:51.708 --> 01:10:54.458
You remember?
In the dark room.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.250
David...

01:10:58.917 --> 01:11:00.625
It was a rainy night.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.833
I need you to talk to me about her.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.458
He did not record that last session,
but David did.

01:11:13.625 --> 01:11:15.208
The rest already knows.

01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:20.167
He went home
even more confused.

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:24.542
And died.

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:35.167
He never answered me
to my first question.

01:11:38.417 --> 01:11:40.542
How did David get to you?

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:48.375
Well, doctor?

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:52.667
Do you want to finally tell me
Something I do not know?

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.125
David's father and me

01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:08.333
We were friends for a long time.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.667
He helped me a lot when ...

01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:17.458
Years ago my wife was
diagnosed an inoperable tumor.

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:22.417
Gordon Jacobs, David's father,
He is a very influential lawyer.

01:12:24.292 --> 01:12:28.917
He helped me avoid jail
for something that I was forced to do.

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:36.167
During the first
hypnotic regression ...

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:39.833
You asked me
why he had interrupted her.

01:12:43.417 --> 01:12:46.000
The woman that David said see
in the hospital room

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:48.458
It was my wife
the day he died.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:54.750
That night I walked
for hours in the rain.

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:59.167
I entered the room, I approached
to her and I could only tell her ...

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:05.375
I could not stand it anymore.

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:09.333
I could not stand his pain
and I gave him

01:13:11.417 --> 01:13:13.333
a lethal dose of morphine.

01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:17.958
My hands were shaking.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:23.917
David could not know that.

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:26.250
He even gave me more details.

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:28.875
I was afraid.

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:31.292
But I needed to know more.

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:37.417
I loved her...

01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:40.083
so much.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.875
Somehow
I was looking for his forgiveness.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.667
<i> I tried to locate him
after our first session, </ i></i>

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:31.083
<i> but he did not return my calls. </ i></i>

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:34.333
<i> I decided to see him the next day. </ i></i>

01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:39.458
<i> Even though it seemed crazy to me,
I needed to try. </ i></i>

01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:17.458
David?

01:15:31.542 --> 01:15:32.542
David?

01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:43.333
David?

01:17:44.667 --> 01:17:45.833
You are here?

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.042
<i> Somehow ... </ i></i>

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:51.792
<i> I felt that my wife was there. </ i></i>

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.208
<i> I would not know how to explain it. </ i></i>

01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:59.042
<i> From that moment
I became obsessed with David. </ i></i>

01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:01.417
<i> She communicated with me
through David. </ i></i>

01:19:03.167 --> 01:19:07.000
<i> If someone could provide me
some kind of peace, </ i></i>

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:09.167
<i> That was him. </ i></i>

01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:28.083
In my opinion,

01:19:29.458 --> 01:19:31.542
I think his wife has forgiven him.

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:37.500
But we are not here
for her, right?

01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:41.375
One lie leads to another.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And in the end you have to remember them all.

01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:01.250
With David ...

01:20:02.917 --> 01:20:05.083
It was his father who asked me for help.

01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:12.125
I had to erase part
of his memory to protect him.

01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:15.292
Your guilt
it would end up surfacing.

01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:48.625
<i> I warned him that he was dangerous,
but he insisted. </ i></i>

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:53.417
<i> I used a radical method. </ i></i>

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:58.500
<i> I should never have used it with him. </ i></i>

01:20:59.708 --> 01:21:00.750
Ok, David.

01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:03.875
Now relax.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.917
And listen to my voice.

01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:10.167
I will give you some instructions.

01:21:12.625 --> 01:21:13.958
Is that possible?

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:18.208
Remove memories
without getting to know them?

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.208
Yes.

01:21:22.333 --> 01:21:25.625
Blocking the period of time
in which everything happened.

01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:30.417
The drugs alter consciousness
and they open a channel directly to the mind.

01:21:30.833 --> 01:21:34.792
In these conditions, the techniques
hypnotics can manipulate

01:21:34.917 --> 01:21:38.167
the memories, the values,
the instincts ... Everything.

01:21:40.583 --> 01:21:43.625
I did not just erase him
that period of his life,

01:21:44.917 --> 01:21:48.042
but I tried to implant
a false memory

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.542
so there would not be
no type of fissure.

01:21:51.917 --> 01:21:53.333
But something failed.

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:27.958
David! David!

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:32.125
I understand that extirpate
some memories knowing them

01:22:33.042 --> 01:22:34.458
It has to be much simpler.

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:36.625
Does it imply that I knew
What had he done?

01:22:38.042 --> 01:22:39.042
Tell me you.

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:42.417
Gordon just told me not to know
It was better for me

01:22:44.333 --> 01:22:47.667
I did not know anything
of what he had done.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.250
If I had known ...
- Gordon, the protector.

01:22:52.917 --> 01:22:55.833
Covering up your son,
protecting his friend the psychiatrist.

01:22:56.333 --> 01:22:59.583
In both cases it was protected
himself from the scandal.

01:23:01.167 --> 01:23:03.917
Gordon Jacobs was a person
extremely selfish

01:23:05.292 --> 01:23:06.292
Was?

01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:10.125
He was found dead in his office
this morning.

01:23:13.042 --> 01:23:14.292
How he died?

01:23:15.792 --> 01:23:17.208
Same as David.

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.667
Verify if it is true.

01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:40.458
I'm Henry, interrogation.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.208
Is it Anne?
Yes, pass me with it.

01:23:44.083 --> 01:23:45.083
Voucher.

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:04.167
I'm not going to stop him,
or to keep him more time.

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:07.292
You can leave if you want.

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:15.208
What are you doing?

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:23.708
It is not possible to prove that you
I knew what David had done.

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:26.458
Or maybe?

01:24:32.875 --> 01:24:34.167
That is the key.

01:24:35.417 --> 01:24:37.542
The detail that changes everything.

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:42.208
Do you know what time David died?

01:24:45.417 --> 01:24:47.500
Alas 22:49 last Sunday.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:50.500
That is not possible.

01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:53.833
He left me a message
after that hour

01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:57.708
I know.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.333
<i> At this moment I can not attend to you. </ i></i>

01:25:03.667 --> 01:25:07.417
<i> If you wish, leave a message
and I'll call him as soon as I can. </ i></i>

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:14.083
<i> I need you, doctor,
I need you here with me. </ i></i>

01:25:28.125 --> 01:25:29.333
Sir, it's true.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.958
Gordon Jacobs
He has been dead this morning.

01:25:32.333 --> 01:25:34.375
And we have not found anything
about her.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.417
Keep looking.
- Yes sir.

01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:39.792
The coroner verified the death
of David, but not what caused it.

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:43.750
He has not even been able to establish
a hypothesis.

01:25:45.042 --> 01:25:46.042
But...

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:50.458
Did not David commit suicide?

01:25:56.792 --> 01:25:58.500
David assumed his guilt.

01:28:45.042 --> 01:28:46.167
Remember Seneca.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.250
Those brands ...

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:08.458
What do they mean?

01:29:10.708 --> 01:29:11.792
Lies.

01:29:45.917 --> 01:29:48.167
He has had several opportunities.

01:29:50.417 --> 01:29:52.833
I'm not here to judge you,
Dr. Friedhoff.

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:54.708
Now it does not depend on me.

01:30:25.292 --> 01:30:27.458
Yale said this
It was not an interrogation.

01:31:04.833 --> 01:31:06.625
Cardona! Cardona!

01:31:06.792 --> 01:31:08.208
Call a doctor!

01:35:02.375 --> 01:35:05.125
<i> I do not remember how it started, </ i></i>

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.208
<i> I do not know when it will end. </ i></i>

01:35:11.083 --> 01:35:14.125
<i> I only see shadows
where there should be light; </ i></i>

01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:17.125
<i> noises instead of ... </ i></i>

01:35:18.375 --> 01:35:19.458
<i> silence. </ i></i>

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:21.042
<i> The wind can not
take the lies. </ i></i>

01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:31.083
<i> She lives in the stars. </ i></i>

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:43.625
<i> An angel that observes
our world. </ i></i>

01:36:47.708 --> 01:36:54.458
<i> She seeks our light. </ i></i>

01:36:58.333 --> 01:37:05.083
<i> Beyond the light </ i></i>

01:37:06.208 --> 01:37:12.958
<i> very far and bright </ i></i>

01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:21.125
<i> there is a place </ i></i>

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:28.500
<i> beyond the light. </ i></i>

01:37:34.042 --> 01:37:40.792
<i> Whispers that
they cross the sky, </ i></i>

01:37:45.083 --> 01:37:51.833
<i> looking for someone
with whom to live. </ i></i>

01:37:56.042 --> 01:37:59.749
<i> We feel guilty </ i></i>

01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:04.208
<i> when we close our eyes </ i></i>

01:38:08.417 --> 01:38:13.792
<i> and we did not find the silence. </ i></i>

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:25.000
<i> Behind the noise,
the evil shines </ i></i>

01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:34.708
<i> but nobody can see it, </ i></i>

01:38:35.167 --> 01:38:40.917
<i> only she can. </ i></i>

01:38:41.667 --> 01:38:48.417
<i> Beyond the light </ i></i>

01:38:49.542 --> 01:38:56.292
<i> very far and bright </ i></i>

01:38:57.958 --> 01:39:04.708
<i> there is a place </ i></i>

01:39:05.333 --> 01:39:12.083
<i> beyond the light. </ i></i>

01:39:14.375 --> 01:39:21.125
<i> Beyond the light </ i></i>

01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:29.000
<i> very far and bright </ i></i>

01:39:30.667 --> 01:39:37.417
<i> there is a place </ i></i>

01:39:38.042 --> 01:39:44.792
<i> beyond the light. </ i></i>

01:39:47.917 --> 01:39:53.958
<i> The wind can not
take the lies. </ i></i>
