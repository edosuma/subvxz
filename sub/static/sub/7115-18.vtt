00:06.000 --> 00:10.030
Okay, if you had to give up the
Internet or one of your feet?

00:10.270 --> 00:12.400
Foot.

00:12.870 --> 00:13.880
Take a foot.

00:14.410 --> 00:15.260
Really?

00:15.360 --> 00:17.300
You all give up a foot to keep the Internet?

00:17.300 --> 00:18.060
Totally.

00:18.110 --> 00:18.810
Wouldn't you?

00:18.880 --> 00:19.880
You love the Internet.

00:19.940 --> 00:21.740
I know, but my foot is a part of my body.

00:21.810 --> 00:25.110
And the Internet is... yeah, bye foot.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.050
All right, future superstars,
take your seats,

00:29.120 --> 00:32.990
because at this point in your
lives, I am in charge of you.

00:33.060 --> 00:33.520
Come on, hurry up.

00:33.590 --> 00:34.220
Let's not waste time.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.130
We've got some excitement today.

00:36.130 --> 00:38.890
Yay, I love excitement.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.330
Who doesn't love excitement?

00:40.400 --> 00:42.160
Damian.

00:42.230 --> 00:47.640
She's right... Tori.

00:47.700 --> 00:48.600
Okay.

00:48.670 --> 00:50.940
So today, instead of
discussing the differences...

00:51.010 --> 00:53.710
Hi. Sorry I'm late,
sweaty and out of breath.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.540
Somebody get me some coffee.

00:55.610 --> 00:57.150
Robbie, just sit down.

00:57.210 --> 00:58.110
Why are you late?

00:58.180 --> 01:00.980
'Cause my Uncle Marty gave
me this old car, which I was

01:01.050 --> 01:04.720
really psyched about, except
it keeps breaking down.

01:04.790 --> 01:07.490
And on my way here, the
motor died in the middle

01:07.560 --> 01:09.490
of a really bad neighborhood.

01:09.560 --> 01:10.230
Now, don't get me wrong.

01:10.290 --> 01:15.100
I like all people, but look,
a mean guy took my left shoe

01:15.170 --> 01:16.670
and Rex's.

01:16.730 --> 01:18.300
Put my foot down.

01:18.370 --> 01:18.930
Okay.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.700
Let's all shut up and let teacher talk.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.470
Now, I bet you are all
familiar with the short film

01:24.540 --> 01:25.810
called "butterface".

01:25.880 --> 01:27.310
Yeah, of course.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.880
Oh my God, I've watched that movie
online like a billion times.

01:29.950 --> 01:32.380
Yeah. Who hasn't?

01:32.450 --> 01:34.850
Well, I'm glad you're all aware of the film

01:34.920 --> 01:38.050
because I'd like you to meet
the director of "butterface... "

01:38.120 --> 01:38.750
no way.

01:38.820 --> 01:39.690
Don't tease me.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.590
... A former student of mine, Dale squires.

01:43.660 --> 01:44.590
Let him hear it.

01:44.660 --> 01:47.300
What's up, guys?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.470
Okay, Dale, the podium is all yours.

01:49.530 --> 01:49.970
Nice.

01:50.030 --> 01:53.040
I've alwayu wanted a plexiglas podium.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.400
Uh, what happened to your shoe?

01:55.470 --> 01:59.380
Oh, it was taken by street toughs.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.040
Hey, is it true that
you're gonna be directing

02:01.110 --> 02:02.240
Johnny depp's new movie?

02:02.310 --> 02:03.780
Uh, looks that way, yeah.

02:03.850 --> 02:10.690
It's so... that even excites me.

02:10.750 --> 02:11.890
Dale... there he is.

02:11.960 --> 02:12.490
Oh my God, there he is.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.260
What is going on here?

02:16.330 --> 02:19.260
Cat sent out a mass text message
that Dale squires is here.

02:19.330 --> 02:20.830
I love mass texting.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.570
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

02:22.630 --> 02:24.700
Hey, hey, guys, you can't... hi, Dale.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.300
I hear you're directing the
new Johnny depp movie.

02:26.370 --> 02:28.070
And guess what? I'd be perfect.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.040
Here's my head shot.

02:29.110 --> 02:29.710
All right.

02:29.770 --> 02:30.970
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.140
If you are not in this class, then leave.

02:34.210 --> 02:34.910
Yeah.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.350
Yeah, you heard the man.

02:36.410 --> 02:38.280
Go on. Get out.

02:38.350 --> 02:42.990
Schoochie, schoochie. Hey.

02:43.050 --> 02:44.590
You too, trina.

02:44.650 --> 02:46.390
But I'd look so good next
to Johnny depp in a movie.

02:46.460 --> 02:47.960
Please, Dale?

02:48.020 --> 02:49.890
Tori, can you make your sister leave?

02:49.960 --> 02:52.500
Trina, stop embarrassing me
or I'm gonna embarrass you.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.900
Don't threaten me.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.970
When trina was six, our
family went to the mall

02:56.030 --> 02:56.900
just before Christmas.

02:56.970 --> 02:57.800
Don't say it.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.440
And she peed... Tori.

02:59.500 --> 03:03.310
... On Santa claus.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.470
Thank you, Tori. Dale?

03:05.540 --> 03:06.140
All right.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.140
What were we talking about?

03:07.210 --> 03:09.310
In all fairness, I did
have a bladder infection.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.000
So that's why I went
with a handheld camera.

04:18.060 --> 04:21.029
I wanted to give it that panicky,
jittery feel, you know?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.640
I love that panicky, jittery feeling.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.740
And it was totally brilliant how
you didn't even see his wife

04:25.810 --> 04:26.370
in that scene.

04:26.440 --> 04:30.940
Yeah, 'cause it made you
think, like, "where is she?"

04:31.010 --> 04:34.150
Well, to be honest, she wasn't
in the scene because the actress

04:34.210 --> 04:36.210
who played the wife got food poisoning

04:36.280 --> 04:38.680
and was puking in the bathroom.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.520
But hey, I'll take brilliant.

04:41.590 --> 04:43.720
One time, I ate a hamburger.

04:43.790 --> 04:46.160
And then, like, an hour
later, I started sneezing,

04:46.230 --> 04:50.400
but I don't think it had anything
to do with the hamburger.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.130
Maybe your red hair dye
seeps through your scalp

04:53.200 --> 04:55.230
and into your brain.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.170
Can that happen?

04:57.240 --> 05:01.370
So, Dale, why don't you tell
my class why you're here?

05:01.440 --> 05:03.410
Yeah.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.580
Well, Chris asked me if I'd help
you guys make a short film,

05:06.650 --> 05:08.050
kind of as a class project.

05:08.110 --> 05:08.750
A what?

05:08.810 --> 05:10.050
No way.

05:10.120 --> 05:10.750
Cool.

05:10.820 --> 05:11.720
And you'll direct it?

05:11.780 --> 05:12.550
Is that cool with you?

05:12.620 --> 05:15.520
That's very cool with me, Dale squires.

05:15.590 --> 05:17.420
So what kind of movie are we gonna make?

05:17.490 --> 05:17.990
I don't know.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.660
I was thinking something
maybe intense, scary.

05:20.730 --> 05:22.230
Like Jade?

05:22.290 --> 05:24.400
Oh.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.470
You knocked him unconscious.

05:27.530 --> 05:30.540
Hey, Beck, maybe we could rework
that one-act play you wrote

05:30.600 --> 05:31.640
last semester?

05:31.700 --> 05:33.240
Yeah, I'd be into that.

05:33.310 --> 05:33.710
Oh.

05:33.770 --> 05:35.470
And I talked to a guy in the
biz, he's gonna let us use

05:35.540 --> 05:37.810
professional film cameras,
lights, whatever we need.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.980
Where are we gonna film?

05:39.050 --> 05:40.650
Oh, we can shoot it at my house.

05:40.710 --> 05:41.310
All right.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.580
I think we're making a movie.

05:42.650 --> 05:45.680
Let's do it.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.150
I created this photo of me
and Johnny depp together,

05:48.220 --> 05:51.320
so you could see what we might
look like as a... on Santa claus.

05:51.390 --> 05:52.460
Bladder infection.

05:52.530 --> 05:57.930
Out.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.930
Hey.

06:06.740 --> 06:09.370
There it is.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.680
There she is.

06:10.740 --> 06:13.610
Oh, right, cars are called she.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.050
Not just cars.

06:15.110 --> 06:16.310
Not just cars?

06:16.380 --> 06:22.150
Also boats, airplanes, my Uncle Barbara.

06:22.220 --> 06:22.690
Okay.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.620
So do you think you can fix my car?

06:24.690 --> 06:26.620
Pop the hood.

06:26.690 --> 06:31.600
Right. The hood.

06:31.660 --> 06:35.670
Okay, popping the hood.

06:35.730 --> 06:40.000
Time to pop the... hood?

06:40.070 --> 06:41.040
I'll do it.

06:41.110 --> 06:46.880
Thank you.

06:46.950 --> 06:48.550
Ahh.

06:48.610 --> 06:54.020
Yeah. Teamwork.

Okay. We got it.

07:07.600 --> 07:14.440
Okay, um... Tori?
Tori?

07:14.510 --> 07:15.370
Hey, mom.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.840
What is all this?

07:16.910 --> 07:18.740
You said I could shoot a
short film here for school.

07:18.810 --> 07:19.240
Yeah.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.010
I thought that meant you,
a couple of friends,

07:21.080 --> 07:23.720
a camcorder, maybe a microphone.

07:23.780 --> 07:25.820
Mom, Dale squires is helping us.

07:25.890 --> 07:27.550
This is a big deal.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.150
Hey, did you buy onion dip?

07:29.220 --> 07:30.590
No.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.890
Why not? Okay.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.430
Where's trina?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.860
Tori locked her in the bathroom.

07:37.930 --> 07:39.860
Cat, you weren't supposed to tell her that.

07:39.930 --> 07:41.800
I'm okay with it.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.640
I'm just gonna go take a hot bath.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.440
Please don't ruin the house.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.010
We're not gonna ruin the house.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.340
My bad.

07:50.410 --> 07:55.580
Oh. Uh...
Just try to... yeah, we'll... okay.

07:55.650 --> 07:56.280
Hey, what time is it?

07:56.350 --> 07:59.750
I'm not your clock.

07:59.820 --> 08:00.420
Almost 9:00.

08:00.490 --> 08:02.920
I need to be home in bed by 10:30.

08:02.990 --> 08:04.590
Can we please get started?

08:04.660 --> 08:05.920
Without a director?

08:05.990 --> 08:06.720
Yeah, where's Dale?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.460
He was supposed to be here at 7:00.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.000
One time, when I was seven,
I was at the beach

08:11.060 --> 08:16.870
and I made a sand castle, and
I called it Cat's castle.

08:16.940 --> 08:19.700
True story.

08:19.770 --> 08:20.710
Hey, hey.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.210
Who's ready to make a movie?

08:22.270 --> 08:23.540
I am.

08:23.610 --> 08:24.510
So Tori.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.710
You're gonna be my little
assistant on this project?

08:26.780 --> 08:27.610
Yeah, sure.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.810
In fact, I mean, I know you're
the director and everything,

08:29.880 --> 08:32.250
but I had a cool idea about how
we could set up the first shot.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.250
Yeah, talk to me.

08:33.320 --> 08:33.720
Okay.

08:33.789 --> 08:36.750
So I was thinking we open
on a close-up of... oh, oh.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.220
Hey, I gotta take this.

08:38.289 --> 08:40.059
Yeah, hey, what's up?

08:40.130 --> 08:42.030
She did?

08:42.090 --> 08:43.929
But it's almost nine and
we have school tomorrow...

08:44.000 --> 08:45.430
You know, just go ahead and
start shooting without me.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.600
Yeah, but I don't know how to...
Just do your close-up thing,

08:48.670 --> 08:48.900
yeah.

08:48.970 --> 08:50.740
The one you were telling me about.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.040
So she's hot.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.310
Okay.

08:55.370 --> 08:57.280
Let's start the first shot.

08:57.340 --> 08:57.810
Beck.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.680
Yeah.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.010
Let me have you on the couch.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.410
Girl...
For the shot.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.350
My bad.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.580
You know, just yelling "my bad"

09:06.650 --> 09:08.520
doesn't make it okay.

09:13.190 --> 09:15.560
So what do you think is wrong with it?

09:15.630 --> 09:16.560
Stuff.

09:16.630 --> 09:20.970
I knew it.

09:21.030 --> 09:23.030
Hey, Beck. Whatcha doin'?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.500
Working on a car?

09:24.570 --> 09:26.300
Yeah, pretty much.

09:26.370 --> 09:29.670
Yup. We're just working
on my car here.

09:29.740 --> 09:34.350
Me and Beck. Little car work.

09:34.410 --> 09:36.010
Hey, Beck.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.650
Is it okay if we watch?

09:38.720 --> 09:39.150
Sure.

09:39.220 --> 09:42.850
You can watch us work on my car.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.230
I'm Robbie.

09:56.670 --> 09:59.100
Monica. Monica.

09:59.170 --> 10:00.710
Do not die on me.

10:00.770 --> 10:02.210
Wake up. I mean it.

10:02.270 --> 10:07.150
Wake up. Come on.

10:07.210 --> 10:08.950
Owww.

10:09.010 --> 10:10.010
Cut.

10:10.080 --> 10:10.650
What?

10:10.720 --> 10:12.320
You're not supposed to hit her.

10:12.380 --> 10:15.820
I felt that's what my character would do.

10:15.890 --> 10:17.020
My face hurts.

10:17.090 --> 10:19.220
Can we try it again without
the physical assault?

10:19.290 --> 10:20.560
You're not the director.

10:20.630 --> 10:26.000
Our director's over there
playing with his laptop.

10:26.070 --> 10:28.000
Wt t here.

10:28.070 --> 10:29.570
Come on. Do you see this?

10:29.640 --> 10:30.570
Do you see it?

10:30.640 --> 10:32.740
Dale, please hang up.

10:32.810 --> 10:34.440
Hey, I gotta jump.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.040
Sorry, but you gotta take
a look at my website.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.580
Can you believe how many comments?

10:38.640 --> 10:40.880
People love me.

10:40.950 --> 10:41.850
I know.

10:41.910 --> 10:44.520
Now could you please help
us shoot this last scene?

10:44.580 --> 10:45.550
What, for the movie?

10:45.620 --> 10:50.090
Yes.

10:50.160 --> 10:56.590
All right. Let's take a look.

10:56.660 --> 10:57.260
All right.

10:57.330 --> 11:02.600
For this scene I think we should...
what scene are we shooting?

11:02.670 --> 11:05.600
Scene 29, where Olivia finds Monica dead.

11:05.670 --> 11:08.840
Oh. Right. Okay.

11:08.910 --> 11:11.040
I want you two up on the couch for that.

11:11.110 --> 11:12.710
You can't have them on the couch.

11:12.780 --> 11:13.750
Why can't I?

11:13.810 --> 11:16.910
'Cause at the end of scene 28,
Monica collapses on the floor.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.080
Well, we don't have to shoot it that way.

11:19.150 --> 11:22.090
We already shot it, squires.

11:22.150 --> 11:23.420
When?

11:23.490 --> 11:25.960
Last night, while you were in the jacuzzi.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.490
Just show him the scene.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.830
You already cut it together?

11:28.890 --> 11:31.660
Yeah. Here.

11:31.730 --> 11:45.540
No, Monica, don't.

11:45.610 --> 11:46.240
Wow.

11:46.310 --> 11:47.950
The movie looks really good.

11:48.010 --> 11:51.880
Thanks. That means so much.

11:51.950 --> 11:52.980
So see?

11:53.050 --> 11:54.790
Monica has to be on the floor.

11:54.850 --> 11:56.590
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

11:56.660 --> 12:00.960
Let's shoot one. Ready? Roll.

12:01.030 --> 12:03.590
Can you please tell her not to slap me?

12:03.660 --> 12:06.200
She should do whatever feels right.

12:06.270 --> 12:11.940
Lie down.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.300
Action.

12:13.370 --> 12:15.970
Monica. Monica.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.640
Do not die on me. Wake up.

12:18.710 --> 12:22.480
I mean it. Wake up. Come on.

12:22.550 --> 12:25.120
Jade.

12:25.180 --> 12:27.150
I'll go get some ice.

12:30.560 --> 12:33.520
Monica.

12:33.590 --> 12:36.660
You cannot die.

12:36.730 --> 12:38.430
You're gonna ruin everything.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.860
Monica.

12:39.930 --> 12:41.470
It looks fantastic.

12:41.530 --> 12:42.970
I know. We did great.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.270
I don't know what happened.

12:44.340 --> 12:45.540
You're a killer.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.540
I'm not. I loved her.

12:47.610 --> 12:48.370
You're a killer!

12:48.440 --> 13:19.100
I loved her!

13:19.170 --> 13:20.370
Yay! They love it.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.570
Yeah, they do.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.140
Ooh, shhh.

13:22.210 --> 13:33.250
Here come our credits.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.050
You said you put all our names at the end.

13:35.120 --> 13:35.790
I did.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.620
Dale must have taken them off.

13:37.690 --> 13:39.060
Thank you.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.220
He's taking all the credit?

13:40.290 --> 13:42.890
Thank you so much. Oh sit.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.560
He's taking all the credit.

13:44.630 --> 13:45.660
I can't believe this.

13:45.730 --> 13:46.600
Yes!

13:46.670 --> 13:51.200
My face still hurts.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.820
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

13:59.260 --> 14:00.530
Thank you. Thank you.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.590
Thank you so much.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.630
It was a labor of love, really.

14:03.700 --> 14:04.960
Shouldn't we say something to him?

14:05.030 --> 14:05.660
Yes.

14:05.730 --> 14:07.700
No.

14:07.770 --> 14:09.270
Go, go, go, go, go.

14:09.340 --> 14:10.070
Thank you. Thank you.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.470
Great film, Dale.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.570
Hey. Dale.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.340
Hey, Tori.

14:13.410 --> 14:15.440
Can you get me a bottle of water?

14:15.510 --> 14:16.270
No!

14:16.340 --> 14:18.440
You took all the credit
for the movie we made.

14:18.510 --> 14:20.240
So I can't get a drink?

14:20.310 --> 14:23.010
Why did you take our names off the movie?

14:23.080 --> 14:25.050
I directed it.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.220
Really?

14:26.290 --> 14:27.550
You didn't even show up most of the time.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.620
And when you did, you just talked
on the phone, ate our snacks,

14:29.690 --> 14:30.960
and napped in our jacuzzi.

14:31.020 --> 14:31.520
Oh come on.

14:31.590 --> 14:35.390
You think Steven Spielberg
really directed jaws?

14:35.460 --> 14:37.300
Yes!

14:37.360 --> 14:39.300
Look, I really gotta go.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.470
Wait.

14:40.530 --> 14:41.500
What?

14:41.570 --> 14:43.270
You know I directed that movie.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.270
Beck wrote it and Andre did
all the music and editing.

14:45.340 --> 14:46.840
What did you do?

14:46.910 --> 14:50.070
I took the credit.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.240
Well, that's mean.

14:51.310 --> 14:53.810
You should at least share
the credit with us.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.150
Man, you really don't
get Hollywood, do you?

14:57.220 --> 14:59.280
Oh, by the way, the
after-party's been canceled,

14:59.350 --> 15:01.950
so tell your friends no after-party.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.960
Hey. Great movie, Dale.

15:04.020 --> 15:04.890
See you at the after-party.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.890
I'm there!

15:21.370 --> 15:22.310
Tori.

15:22.370 --> 15:23.340
Vega.

15:23.410 --> 15:24.380
What?

15:24.440 --> 15:26.510
Check out the homepage on splashface.

15:26.580 --> 15:29.780
I've already seen the
"lobster on a bicycle" video.

15:29.850 --> 15:32.620
Look up top.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.490
Our movie is the number one featured video.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.190
Two million views in one day.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.320
And Dale squires is takin' all the credit.

15:38.390 --> 15:43.060
And he keeps deleting all my
very creative negative comments.

15:43.130 --> 15:44.800
Ulch. Look at this.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.060
He's using our movie to promote himself.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.270
What'd he write?

15:48.330 --> 15:51.970
"Catch me Thursday night
on the mack Murphy show."

15:52.040 --> 15:56.740
Hey, don't they tape mack Murphy
down the street, off sunset?

15:56.810 --> 15:58.180
Yeah, I think.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.280
Sooooo maybe we should go.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.010
Ulch, gross.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.720
Talk shows are for tourists and canadians.

16:04.780 --> 16:07.290
And revenge-seekers.

16:07.350 --> 16:09.690
Ahhh. So what's the plan?

16:09.760 --> 16:10.220
I dunno.

16:10.290 --> 16:17.900
You're smart, she's mean,
come up with something.

16:17.960 --> 16:22.530
Man, those jeans fit you great.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.200
How's the tor?

16:24.270 --> 16:26.570
It's getting there.

16:26.640 --> 16:43.250
Ooh, here comes girls!

16:43.320 --> 16:43.690
Hey, Beck.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.190
Hi, Beck.

16:44.260 --> 16:45.260
Hi, Beck.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.190
Hey, girls.

16:46.260 --> 16:47.590
Here to see us work on the motor?

16:47.660 --> 16:51.160
'Cause it's gettin' there.

16:51.230 --> 16:53.430
Beck, those jeans fit you great.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.730
Uh-huh.

16:54.800 --> 17:01.110
That's what I said! Um...
Whoa, workin' on this car's

17:01.170 --> 17:03.170
got me all filthy.

17:03.240 --> 17:09.280
How am I gonna get this grease off me?

17:09.349 --> 17:13.920
Uh, no, I was thinking maybe you
could get me a fresh towel...

17:13.990 --> 17:14.790
Okay! Okay! Okay!

17:14.849 --> 17:15.990
That's enough. That's enough.

17:16.050 --> 17:20.790
All right. That's enough water!

17:20.859 --> 17:22.290
I think he's still dirty.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.560
What'd he say?

17:24.630 --> 17:30.500
Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!

17:30.570 --> 17:32.470
How does a hose have that much pressure?!

17:32.540 --> 17:34.110
Oh!

17:45.650 --> 17:46.450
Okay, people.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.990
Listen up, listen up.

17:48.050 --> 17:49.990
We're about 10 minutes
away from go-time

17:50.060 --> 17:54.590
on up late with mack
Murphy, so lemme hear ya!

18:01.030 --> 18:05.340
Look at all the stupid tourists.

18:05.400 --> 18:05.670
Hey.

18:05.740 --> 18:06.100
Hey, Andre.

18:06.170 --> 18:06.770
Hi.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.970
This is my cousin, kendra.

18:08.040 --> 18:08.310
Hey.

18:08.370 --> 18:08.770
Pretty shirt.

18:08.840 --> 18:09.270
'Sup.

18:09.340 --> 18:10.170
She's a great actress.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.150
I get paid up front.

18:14.210 --> 18:20.550
20, 30, 40, keep it comin', 50.

18:20.620 --> 18:20.950
Okay.

18:21.020 --> 18:22.590
So when Dale squires sits
down, you're gonna wait

18:22.650 --> 18:24.090
exactly two minutes, and then your gonna...

18:24.160 --> 18:25.160
Andre told me what to do.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.490
I don't have to hear it twice.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.630
Yes, ma'am.

18:31.700 --> 18:35.770
What do you eat? Salad?

18:35.830 --> 18:36.800
Sometimes.

18:36.870 --> 18:40.400
Figures.

18:43.180 --> 18:45.480
... Totally awesome site.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.180
I just don't see how a regular hose

18:47.250 --> 18:48.910
could have that much pressure.

18:48.980 --> 18:49.250
Yep.

18:49.310 --> 18:51.980
That's a mysterious hose.

18:52.050 --> 18:54.150
So how long before we can
get her running again?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.790
Three, four seconds.

18:55.850 --> 19:02.330
Huh?

19:02.390 --> 19:05.630
Wow. It sounds great.

19:05.700 --> 19:12.300
Uh-huh.

19:12.370 --> 19:14.110
You're not smiling.

19:14.170 --> 19:16.570
I only smile when I'm happy.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.380
Okay. Talk to daddy.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.150
It's just... I was kinda having fun

19:21.210 --> 19:23.910
with this whole car-fixing
thing 'cause of all the girls

19:23.980 --> 19:26.080
who came by to watch.

19:26.150 --> 19:28.220
They sprayed you with a hose.

19:28.290 --> 19:32.290
Well, I didn't like that part, but...
Dude. Now, you got a car,

19:32.360 --> 19:35.590
a convertible, that works.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.830
I'm not following your
"cool guy logic."

19:37.900 --> 19:42.730
Girls like guys that have cars.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.100
Right!

19:44.170 --> 19:48.710
Because I can drive them
places, like, to a store!

19:48.770 --> 19:49.810
Uh-huh.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.240
Now, you want me to go
find you some cheerleaders

19:51.310 --> 19:52.280
who need a ride?

19:52.340 --> 19:54.480
Okay.

19:54.550 --> 19:56.550
Will the cheerleaders be
wearing their uniforms?

19:56.620 --> 20:00.650
That's what makes them cheerleaders.

20:02.150 --> 20:06.990
What the?

20:07.060 --> 20:07.760
Over there!

20:07.830 --> 20:08.460
Hey, wait.

20:08.530 --> 20:09.430
Wait, who are you guys?

20:09.490 --> 20:10.430
Wait... ahhh!

20:10.500 --> 20:11.630
Oh.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.330
Hey!

20:13.400 --> 20:14.970
You guys can't borrow my car!

20:15.030 --> 20:25.180
We're not borrowing it.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.650
Uh, loser.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.280
And you're gonna be working with
Johnny depp on a big movie?

20:32.350 --> 20:33.920
Yeah, made the deal this morning.

20:33.990 --> 20:34.520
Awesome.

20:34.590 --> 20:36.550
I'm betting it didn't hurt
that this new short film

20:36.620 --> 20:38.160
that you just did has already gotten,

20:38.220 --> 20:40.560
what, like, three million views this week?

20:40.630 --> 20:41.460
Uh-huh.

20:41.530 --> 20:44.560
Have you guys seen Dale's short film?

20:49.330 --> 20:51.540
Jerk.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.700
30 seconds.

20:52.770 --> 20:54.870
Yeah, about that film.

20:54.940 --> 20:56.210
I, I gotta be honest.

20:56.270 --> 20:59.580
So you're not going into politics?

20:59.640 --> 21:03.310
That was off-the-cuff.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.780
It's just, I've been feeling kinda guilty.

21:05.850 --> 21:06.980
About?

21:07.050 --> 21:10.790
Well, it wouldn't be fair for me
to take credit for that movie.

21:10.860 --> 21:13.190
See, most of the work was done
by a really talented group

21:13.260 --> 21:15.230
of students from Hollywood arts High School

21:15.290 --> 21:18.860
here in L.A., specifically...
I would like to give credit

21:18.930 --> 21:22.830
to Andre Harris, Jade West, Beck oliver...

21:22.900 --> 21:24.600
Oh, he's giving us credit.

21:24.670 --> 21:26.870
On national tv.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.140
...Robbie shapiro,
sinjin van cleef,

21:29.210 --> 21:32.440
and most importantly, Tori Vega.

21:32.510 --> 21:33.410
Your cousin!

21:33.480 --> 21:33.980
My cousin.

21:34.050 --> 21:35.280
She's gonna... oh man.

21:35.350 --> 21:36.080
We have to stop her!

21:36.150 --> 21:37.680
Abort. Abort.

21:37.750 --> 21:40.150
Abort.

21:40.220 --> 21:41.520
Abort.

21:41.590 --> 21:44.560
No. No. No. Stop. Stop.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.020
Here we go.

21:47.090 --> 21:50.160
Hey there! Dale squires!

21:50.230 --> 21:56.630
Uh, apparently, you have
a fan in the crowd.

21:56.700 --> 21:57.100
Hey, Dale!

21:57.170 --> 21:58.840
How come you lied to me?!

21:58.900 --> 22:00.140
Uh, ma'am?

22:00.210 --> 22:00.940
I don't know you.

22:01.010 --> 22:01.670
I don't know her.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.840
You, you don't know me?!

22:03.910 --> 22:06.640
This man took me to a fish
restaurant two weeks ago

22:06.710 --> 22:11.380
and told me he loved me, and I
haven't heard from him since!

22:11.450 --> 22:13.480
No, no, no, no, no.

22:13.550 --> 22:15.420
C'mon, all right, she's lying!

22:15.490 --> 22:15.920
Okay?

22:15.990 --> 22:17.150
You are a liar!

22:17.220 --> 22:19.060
Liar?! Oh no.

22:19.120 --> 22:19.720
That's it!

22:19.790 --> 22:24.600
I'm about to open up a cloud
and rain all over you!

22:24.660 --> 22:25.630
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

22:25.700 --> 22:27.000
Get off me!

22:27.070 --> 22:28.900
I don't know you!

22:28.970 --> 22:30.470
I wanna go back to that fish restaurant!

22:30.540 --> 22:31.940
Can you go to a commercial?!

22:32.000 --> 22:33.540
No way, man, this is awesome!

22:33.610 --> 22:35.740
You guys likin' this?!

22:38.880 --> 22:40.340
Yeah! Now you're upside down!

22:40.410 --> 22:42.450
How do you like that, Dale squires?!

22:42.510 --> 22:43.780
How do you like atat?

22:43.850 --> 22:45.780
She's so strong.

22:45.850 --> 22:46.950
Dale gave us credit.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.050
Even I feel bad.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.620
We should do something.

22:50.690 --> 22:51.560
Waffles?

22:51.620 --> 22:52.120
I like waffles.

22:52.190 --> 22:53.220
Waffles are good.

22:53.290 --> 22:53.860
I know a place.

22:53.930 --> 22:55.500
Off we go.

23:01.970 --> 23:01.970
What did I do?!

23:02.170 --> 23:03.370
