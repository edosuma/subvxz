00:51.769 --> 00:53.236
Are you... you like that?

00:55.840 --> 00:57.207
Smile, you're on camera!

00:58.642 --> 01:01.244
Yeah! You're a star now.
You're gonna love it!

01:14.959 --> 01:17.695
Wayne. Wayne.

01:18.896 --> 01:20.230
Wayne.

01:21.699 --> 01:22.967
How do you feel today, Wayne?

01:24.534 --> 01:26.971
I feel better, Dr. Yates.

01:27.537 --> 01:28.973
Ready to leave.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.915
You know, we've been working
together for some time now.

01:38.983 --> 01:42.519
Every time you and I talk,
we get a little deeper.

01:42.552 --> 01:45.957
You remember a new detail
you can let go of.

01:47.390 --> 01:49.292
You think I let go of it?

01:55.465 --> 01:57.001
Is that what you think?

01:57.902 --> 01:58.970
Huh?

01:59.636 --> 02:03.908
Dr. Yates, it's impossible...

02:05.076 --> 02:08.813
impossible to stop hating them.

02:10.413 --> 02:13.818
To not want to hurt them
like they hurt me.

02:19.857 --> 02:23.393
I'm trying to let it go. I am.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.933
But pouring over it with you
again and again

02:30.001 --> 02:31.736
is not helping me.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.740
Maybe it's time you knew
a little more about me.

02:46.717 --> 02:49.486
Did you know I, too,
was bullied when I was your age.

02:50.420 --> 02:55.392
I thought these people
who I counted as my friends

02:55.425 --> 02:57.327
were trying to kill me.

02:59.130 --> 03:00.597
They almost did.

03:01.699 --> 03:02.667
What happened?

03:04.068 --> 03:05.468
I was humiliated.

03:06.971 --> 03:08.840
And a video was made
of that humiliation

03:08.873 --> 03:11.776
and everyone I knew saw it.

03:12.743 --> 03:15.880
So you see, you and I
aren't so different, are we?

03:24.621 --> 03:25.857
You've made progress.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.059
Remarkable progress.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.661
You were very much
a danger to yourself

03:30.695 --> 03:31.762
when you arrived here.

03:34.598 --> 03:36.834
<i>And after that,
you were a danger to others.</i>

03:41.939 --> 03:45.710
Now, I believe you're well past
such violent episodes.

04:24.547 --> 04:27.852
Hey, guys, it's Julie Miles,
and I'm hoping you can get me

04:27.885 --> 04:30.587
- to 500,000 followers today.
- <i>What up!</i>

04:30.620 --> 04:32.589
So if you don't know my crew
on InstaTalk,

04:32.622 --> 04:34.158
I figured I'd introduce you
to them.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.960
So we can help get them
to 500K too.

04:35.993 --> 04:37.695
Take my friend Beth here.

04:37.728 --> 04:39.063
- Hey, Beth.
- <i>Hey, guys.</i>

04:39.096 --> 04:40.865
- Hey!
- <i>Hey, Beth.</i>

04:40.898 --> 04:43.034
So in third grade, she was
the new kid on the block.

04:43.067 --> 04:46.137
And had a total loner
and outsider vibe. At least...

04:46.170 --> 04:49.173
- until she grew those.
- <i>That's my girl!</i>

04:49.206 --> 04:51.776
- Way to go, girl!
- <i>Let's use those knockers!</i>

04:51.809 --> 04:53.945
And then, suddenly,
she was very popular.

04:53.978 --> 04:56.479
Oh, see my friend Darrin here?

04:56.513 --> 04:58.115
<i>Sup, everybody? What's goin' on</i>

04:58.149 --> 04:59.684
- <i>What up!</i>
- What's up, Darrin?

04:59.717 --> 05:01.551
<i>I taught him everything
he knows!</i>

05:01.584 --> 05:05.189
Now, he used to be so just
quiet and shy.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.557
Then he got a growth spurt,
started working out,

05:07.590 --> 05:09.260
learned how to throw
a football, and it was as if

05:09.293 --> 05:12.263
Bell Fountain's own superman
had just dropped from the sky.

05:12.296 --> 05:14.497
<i>Ew. That's gross.</i>

05:14.531 --> 05:17.134
And then, that's Aiko.
Hey, Aiko, girl!

05:17.168 --> 05:19.837
<i>Hey,</i> chica, <i>what's up?</i>
<i>I like your hair.</i>

05:19.870 --> 05:21.739
And this is Albert.

05:21.772 --> 05:23.540
<i>Hey! What's up?</i>

05:23.573 --> 05:25.776
And thanks to InstaTalk,
he has gone global

05:25.810 --> 05:28.611
with his teen angst,
and will do anything

05:28.645 --> 05:30.815
for, well, anybody's attention.

05:30.848 --> 05:33.583
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>Al, you crazy man.</i>

05:33.616 --> 05:35.987
- <i>The dude is nuts.</i>
- Meanwhile, my boyfriend,

05:36.020 --> 05:37.620
- Jeremy...
- <i>Hey, Babe.</i>

05:37.655 --> 05:39.757
<i>That's my boy! A protégé.</i>

05:39.790 --> 05:42.525
Right now, all the attention
is on...

05:42.559 --> 05:44.729
- Tabitha!
- <i>That's my boo.</i>

05:44.762 --> 05:47.965
She's the newest member
to our crew, and really,

05:47.999 --> 05:50.600
my personal favorite,
aside from Jeremy, of course.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.535
- Love you, babe.
- <i>Good save.</i>

05:52.569 --> 05:55.106
She was the first in our school
to reach over 500,000 followers.

05:55.139 --> 05:57.208
- Stop!
- And now is at just a million.

05:57.241 --> 06:00.044
I mean, it's cool!

06:00.077 --> 06:02.713
But so I could tell you
all my friends and I

06:02.747 --> 06:05.282
are way different from what we
post on our InstaTalk pages.

06:05.316 --> 06:07.852
I like to think there are
pieces of the real us there.

06:07.885 --> 06:10.154
Maybe you can spot 'em.
I like to think you can.

06:10.187 --> 06:11.822
But maybe this

06:11.856 --> 06:13.858
is what it's all about.

06:13.891 --> 06:15.659
A connection
that we can believe in.

06:15.693 --> 06:18.062
A link to the rest
of humanity that can

06:18.095 --> 06:20.131
ultimately lead us back
to ourselves.

06:20.164 --> 06:22.099
So I'll tell you what, boys.

06:22.133 --> 06:25.302
If you can get me to 500,000
followers in the next minute...

06:25.336 --> 06:26.704
I'll make out

06:26.737 --> 06:28.239
with Tabitha here.

06:28.272 --> 06:29.874
<i>Find a homeless person.
Give them an iPhone.</i>

06:29.907 --> 06:31.308
<i>Let them make an account
right now.</i>

06:31.342 --> 06:34.912
<i>Follow, subscribe. I need this.</i>

06:34.945 --> 06:36.847
You're gonna break 500K!

06:36.881 --> 06:38.615
Tabs, let's give them
what they want.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.252
Psych!

06:41.285 --> 06:42.820
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

06:44.688 --> 06:47.091
<i>Just stop following 'em. Stop..</i>

06:51.662 --> 06:53.664
<i>Hey, superstar.</i>

06:53.697 --> 06:54.965
<i>I wanna come over.</i>

06:54.999 --> 06:57.334
Well, you can't. I'm studying.

06:57.368 --> 07:00.171
<i>Okay, well, your last InstaTalk
moment doesn't lie.</i>

07:00.204 --> 07:02.073
<i>Oh, come on. You know those
are completely necessary</i>

07:02.106 --> 07:03.707
<i>in my continued survival.</i>

07:03.741 --> 07:06.643
True, but why should Tabs
get all the fun?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.679
<i>She still there?</i>

07:08.712 --> 07:10.714
- Nope.
- I'm on my way.

07:10.748 --> 07:12.750
My parents are gonna be gone
for three weeks.

07:12.783 --> 07:14.852
Can you wait until their plane
takes off?

07:16.020 --> 07:18.322
Who waits?
We're the I WIN generation.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.959
- The what?
- The I Want It Now generation.

07:21.992 --> 07:23.828
Did you come up with that
all by yourself?

07:23.861 --> 07:25.362
Yes, but you can have it.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.630
<i>Where are they goin', anyway?</i>

07:28.265 --> 07:30.101
On an ashram.

07:30.134 --> 07:31.735
<i>An assram?</i>

07:32.770 --> 07:34.371
They paid thousands of dollars

07:34.405 --> 07:36.941
to go huddle inside
of a frozen mountain in India.

07:36.974 --> 07:39.710
It's supposed to lead
to a spiritual awakening.

07:39.743 --> 07:42.046
<i>So why can't I come over?</i>

07:42.079 --> 07:44.882
SATs headass. I'm studying!

07:44.915 --> 07:47.284
How are you
my girlfriend?

07:47.318 --> 07:49.653
- Jeremy!
- Come on.

07:49.687 --> 07:52.356
You know I'm kidding!
I just can't get enough of you.

07:52.923 --> 07:55.159
<i>You will always be
the all-star quarterback</i>

07:55.192 --> 07:57.027
<i>I fell in love with
in ninth grade.</i>

07:57.061 --> 07:59.230
But I gotta go. Okay?

07:59.263 --> 08:00.331
I'll see you tomorrow?

08:02.266 --> 08:05.836
Fine, but check IT.
Sending you something.

08:05.870 --> 08:07.238
Oh, what'd you send me?

08:07.271 --> 08:09.340
- <i>You'll see.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.189
Oh, Albert, your cries for views

08:25.222 --> 08:26.757
are just getting
weirder and weirder.

08:31.462 --> 08:34.031
<i>It's okay. It's okay.
Whatever you need.</i>

08:34.064 --> 08:35.699
<i>Just please...</i>

08:36.167 --> 08:37.768
Oh, my God.

08:46.744 --> 08:50.981
Uh, Tabitha, uh, I, I saw this
video from Albert.

08:51.015 --> 08:52.950
- I got it too.
- <i>Do you think it was real?</i>

08:52.983 --> 08:54.285
Holy shit, it looked real.

08:54.318 --> 08:56.020
I don't know.
But I'm freaking out!

08:56.053 --> 08:59.290
You're freaking out?
I'm home alone. I'm coming over.

08:59.924 --> 09:01.492
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

09:01.525 --> 09:03.327
<i>I gotta do one thing
and I'll be right there.</i>

09:16.140 --> 09:17.741
Hey!

09:17.775 --> 09:20.044
Howdy, neighbor.

09:20.077 --> 09:21.812
Howdy?

09:29.887 --> 09:31.922
Oh, Jesus, are you trying
to get me...

09:31.956 --> 09:33.424
Ow! Julie!

09:33.457 --> 09:35.359
- What the hell?
- Fuck you! That wasn't funny!

09:35.392 --> 09:37.828
- Asshole!
- What? What's wrong?

09:39.463 --> 09:41.765
Hey, seriously, what's up?

09:41.799 --> 09:44.335
Albert's latest masterpiece?
It's disgusting.

09:45.569 --> 09:47.905
What? This is the link
I sent you.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.542
What's up with Albert?

09:51.575 --> 09:53.444
I think he's just messing
around, but...

09:54.111 --> 09:57.248
this video,
it wasn't like the others.

09:57.281 --> 09:58.482
Well, show me.

10:01.819 --> 10:03.420
Oh, the signal here blows.

10:03.454 --> 10:06.223
Here, Tabby was in that moment
too. Let's go, okay?

10:06.257 --> 10:07.524
- Come on.
- All right.

10:12.963 --> 10:15.132
I'm going to make
a Darrin sundae.

10:20.237 --> 10:22.106
And how are you
gonna do that?

10:22.906 --> 10:26.377
Well, first, I'm gonna cover you
in chocolate sauce.

10:26.410 --> 10:28.345
I'm gonna put cherries
on your nipples.

10:28.379 --> 10:30.414
And sprinkles down
your treasure trail.

10:31.081 --> 10:32.816
Then you're gonna lick it
all off?

10:32.850 --> 10:34.451
I'm sending you to college,
baby.

10:34.485 --> 10:37.521
I'm gonna take off all my
clothes and rub myself

10:37.554 --> 10:40.557
up and down your entire body
until...

10:40.591 --> 10:42.459
<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

10:42.493 --> 10:44.561
You provide the whip cream.

10:45.262 --> 10:47.865
Oh, baby, I always said
you were good in the kitchen.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.400
I'm great in every room.

10:55.105 --> 10:58.542
Um, I have to go.
Are you gonna stay on?

10:58.575 --> 11:01.545
I was gonna stay up and do some
IT, and then go to bed,

11:01.578 --> 11:03.480
<i>but I'll wait
if you want to play with me.</i>

11:06.116 --> 11:07.384
Darrin?

11:08.452 --> 11:09.353
What the fuck?

11:09.386 --> 11:10.454
Hey, babe.

11:10.487 --> 11:11.922
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

11:11.955 --> 11:13.190
No, I've been trying
to call you.

11:15.059 --> 11:17.261
Oh, fuck, I'm so sorry, Tabby.

11:18.295 --> 11:19.830
I need you to come over.

11:20.564 --> 11:23.367
Now? Is everything okay?

11:23.400 --> 11:25.869
It's Albert. We got a video.

11:25.903 --> 11:29.006
Is it the doggy
threesome rim job?

11:29.039 --> 11:32.109
- That video is sick, dude.
- Okay, this isn't funny.

11:32.142 --> 11:33.610
Can you just please come over?

11:33.644 --> 11:36.080
All right. Yeah.
I'll be right there.

11:52.496 --> 11:55.032
- Hey.
- I'm freaking out.

11:55.065 --> 11:57.167
Hey. So what's going on?

11:57.201 --> 11:58.936
- It's Albert. Someone killed...
- It's Albert, this video,

11:58.969 --> 12:00.471
- and there's blood...
- ...right through his eye...

12:00.504 --> 12:02.973
One at a time, okay?
Did you check his InstaTalk?

12:03.006 --> 12:04.441
He's not even logged on.

12:04.475 --> 12:06.377
- Should we call him?
- Call him?

12:06.410 --> 12:08.145
- Be serious.
- This is an emergency.

12:08.178 --> 12:09.413
We need to call him!

12:09.446 --> 12:11.014
<i>Losers leave messages.</i>

12:11.048 --> 12:12.282
Straight to voicemail.
His phone is off.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.451
- His phone's off?
- Relax, okay?

12:14.485 --> 12:16.353
Uh, let's,
let's look at the video.

12:21.358 --> 12:24.061
Never seen pussy do that before.

12:24.094 --> 12:26.029
That's not the video.

12:26.063 --> 12:28.532
What we saw was Albert and his
head was being pushed down.

12:28.565 --> 12:30.100
He obviously
just killed the moment

12:30.134 --> 12:32.035
- once he knew you guys saw it.
- No.

12:32.069 --> 12:34.004
What was his last IT post?

12:34.037 --> 12:37.474
Uh, the last thing I can see is
Albert's heading to Viva Taco

12:37.508 --> 12:39.610
- at 2:00 p.m.
- Something's not right.

12:39.643 --> 12:41.545
He updates this thing
every time he farts.

12:45.082 --> 12:48.419
OMG, guys! Albert's dead,
he's really dead, isn't he?

12:48.452 --> 12:50.287
Hey, what's going on here,
Tabitha?

12:50.320 --> 12:52.022
Not a good time, Peter.

12:52.055 --> 12:53.991
- He's dead.
- Who's dead?

12:54.024 --> 12:56.960
- He's dead.
- Who's dead?

12:56.994 --> 12:59.196
Someone sent us a video
on InstaTalk as a moment.

12:59.229 --> 13:01.432
It was of Albert getting stabbed
in the face.

13:01.465 --> 13:03.133
Yeah, right. Let me see this.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.969
- You can't. The moment's passed.
- What moment?

13:06.003 --> 13:08.706
When a user posts a video
on InstaTalk as a moment,

13:08.740 --> 13:11.442
it's over when they say it is.
We can't get it back,

13:11.475 --> 13:13.177
but we know what we saw, Dad.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.045
- He's dead.
- Okay, Beth. It's okay.

13:15.078 --> 13:17.381
- I got you.
- Guys, it's just Albert

13:17.414 --> 13:18.582
looking for clout.

13:18.615 --> 13:20.417
He hasn't had a hit for a while,

13:20.451 --> 13:22.453
so his user numbers
have really leveled off.

13:22.486 --> 13:25.055
It's not him happy slapping
a homeless man,

13:25.088 --> 13:26.658
or crapping in a water fountain,
okay?

13:26.691 --> 13:28.660
I think I know
what's going on here.

13:28.693 --> 13:30.527
I think this Albert's having
a little fun

13:30.561 --> 13:31.696
at the girls' expense.

13:31.729 --> 13:33.497
It's not like that, Peter.

13:33.530 --> 13:35.432
Okay, stop calling me Peter.
It's Dad.

13:35.466 --> 13:38.235
And I think this Albert is just
trying to get a little attention

13:38.268 --> 13:40.471
for his pitiful sense
of self-worth.

13:40.504 --> 13:43.307
He does that by posting
these practical jokes as videos.

13:43.340 --> 13:46.009
I've seen his type before.
Believe me.

13:46.043 --> 13:47.679
Now, your parents
are probably worried.

13:47.712 --> 13:49.279
I think you should go home.

13:50.815 --> 13:52.282
Okay.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.085
Don't slam the door.

13:55.820 --> 13:57.354
Bye, babe.

13:59.223 --> 14:00.123
All right.

14:02.459 --> 14:04.595
Uh, Beth. Wait a sec.

14:05.830 --> 14:08.031
Look, I'm sorry for
what that kid did to you.

14:08.065 --> 14:09.734
- I know how boys can be.
- Mm-hmm.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.369
Um, if you just need someone
to talk to,

14:12.402 --> 14:15.572
I'm a pretty good listener,
and my phone's always on.

14:16.139 --> 14:18.676
Thanks, Tabitha's dad.

14:19.543 --> 14:20.444
Yeah.

14:21.411 --> 14:22.446
Ew.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.115
I want to talk to you.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.518
Hey, I'm gonna go be
with Tabby, okay?

14:27.551 --> 14:29.186
All right. Sounds good.

14:30.788 --> 14:32.556
- Hey.
- Yeah?

14:32.589 --> 14:33.758
What the hell was that
all about?

14:33.791 --> 14:35.559
That was nothing.

14:35.592 --> 14:37.294
I for real think Al's in some
kind of trouble, though, guys.

14:37.327 --> 14:40.297
Beth, it's Albert.
It's obviously a gag.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.266
Well, then, I'm staying
with you tonight.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.301
Absolutely not.

14:44.334 --> 14:46.270
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.372
Then maybe I should go back
inside with Tabby.

14:49.239 --> 14:51.208
Fine.

14:51.876 --> 14:53.745
- Drop me off at home first?
- Get in.

15:24.474 --> 15:25.509
Wayne?

15:27.177 --> 15:28.046
Wayne?

15:31.381 --> 15:34.551
Hey, wait. Wait!
Hey, I, I just wanna talk.

15:36.286 --> 15:37.588
Wait!

15:48.332 --> 15:50.735
Yeah, no, we should take
a cycling class next week.

15:50.768 --> 15:53.236
- <i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
- I'm about to hit it.

15:53.838 --> 15:56.239
Three point five miles!

15:56.708 --> 15:59.543
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- Suck on that, bitches.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.680
- This is my friend, Julie.
- Hi!

16:03.347 --> 16:04.682
- All right, guys. I'm gonna go.
- <i>Bye!</i>

16:10.320 --> 16:14.358
So I heard you
and Peter arguing.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.626
Do you wanna talk about it?

16:16.193 --> 16:18.562
He's an asshole. End of story.

16:18.595 --> 16:20.130
What did he say?

16:20.732 --> 16:22.800
He says he doesn't want me
seeing Darrin.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.468
'Cause he's going to college.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.839
He doesn't like
any of my friends.

16:27.872 --> 16:28.740
Except you.

16:30.607 --> 16:33.745
- He loves you.
- Well, what's not to like?

16:35.379 --> 16:37.447
He said he doesn't believe us
about the video.

16:37.481 --> 16:39.449
And now that we've moved here
from the city,

16:39.483 --> 16:41.953
nothing bad can happen,
which is bullshit.

16:41.986 --> 16:44.287
Nothing's creepier
than a suburb, gorgeous.

16:44.321 --> 16:46.958
I love you, Julie.

16:46.991 --> 16:48.926
I feel like you're my only
real friend.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.929
Uh, actually, you have over
a million friends,

16:51.963 --> 16:54.699
- last time I checked.
- Yeah, Tabitha as titbait.

16:54.732 --> 16:57.702
No, I like it.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.303
All those people
that I'm connected to

17:00.337 --> 17:01.873
but will never meet.

17:01.906 --> 17:04.776
As I suffer through their
fucking vacation photos,

17:04.809 --> 17:08.680
and their cat videos,
and their filtered selfies.

17:08.713 --> 17:10.647
Their bullshit photos
that they hide behind

17:10.682 --> 17:12.917
to try to prove that they're
living their best lives,

17:12.950 --> 17:16.486
when in reality, they're just
as miserable as the rest of us.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.388
It reminds me that I have you.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.858
And that our connection is real.

17:21.793 --> 17:23.293
I treasure it.

17:24.662 --> 17:26.563
- You know what? I'm sweaty.
- I don't care.

17:26.596 --> 17:28.598
- It's really not a good look.
- I don't care.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.735
- I love you.
- I love you too.

17:48.285 --> 17:49.252
Hey!

17:49.286 --> 17:50.955
Oh, my God.

17:55.625 --> 17:58.863
It's just me.
Today's word is discretion.

17:58.896 --> 18:00.464
I know it's a little bigger
than you're used to,

18:00.497 --> 18:01.799
but you should look it up!

18:01.833 --> 18:03.567
I could have been you know who.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.837
- How'd you even find us?
- Find a Friend app, moron.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.805
All us girls are on it.
And by the way,

18:07.839 --> 18:10.340
I didn't see you on IT at all
last night, where were you?

18:10.373 --> 18:13.510
- I'm on a digital cleanse.
- What happened?

18:13.543 --> 18:16.013
Did your subscription
to carpetmuncher.com expire?

18:16.047 --> 18:18.648
- Hmm, eat me, asshole.
- You wish.

18:18.683 --> 18:19.917
I wish you would fall off.

18:20.718 --> 18:22.720
I went out with Jim.
I let him kiss me.

18:22.754 --> 18:25.522
It tasted like Burger King.
Kissing boys is so gross.

18:25.555 --> 18:26.958
I don't know what you see in it.

18:26.991 --> 18:29.359
Yeah, Beth, you freak.

18:29.392 --> 18:31.461
I was talking to you, man whore.

18:31.495 --> 18:33.296
I was really drunk
at that party, okay?

18:33.330 --> 18:34.766
And I told you that
in confidence.

18:34.799 --> 18:37.634
Oh, my God. Who cares.

18:37.668 --> 18:39.402
It wasn't even like that.

18:41.471 --> 18:43.440
Oh, my fuck. Who cares?

18:43.473 --> 18:44.809
Albert can be in real trouble.

18:44.842 --> 18:46.643
- That video?
- So nasty.

18:50.114 --> 18:51.548
Yo, what's good?

18:52.884 --> 18:55.452
- Hey, is that him?
- No, it's Jeremy.

18:55.485 --> 18:56.954
Well, tell him to get his ass
over here.

18:56.988 --> 18:57.989
Can you get me a mocha?

18:59.623 --> 19:01.491
Hewitt's out of Sunnybrook.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.528
Wayne Hewitt?

19:04.561 --> 19:06.429
Two days ago.
I hacked their site.

19:06.998 --> 19:09.934
Your nurse fetish's got you
searchin' mental hospitals now?

19:09.967 --> 19:12.369
No, dipshit.
I saw him last night.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.938
What? Where?

19:13.971 --> 19:15.907
<i>When you dropped me off,
I saw him at my house.</i>

19:15.940 --> 19:18.542
I didn't get too close,
but I'm pretty sure it was him.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.644
- Okay, so...
- <i>Think about it.</i>

19:20.678 --> 19:23.848
Hewitt gets out.
Albert gets a tool in his eye.

19:25.382 --> 19:26.851
Is there any chance
you were stoned

19:26.884 --> 19:28.618
during this phantom encounter?

19:28.653 --> 19:30.688
Would you listen to me?
I know what I saw, Darrin.

19:30.721 --> 19:32.990
Oh, just like you saw
David Bowie at IHOP

19:33.024 --> 19:35.893
- the day after he died, right?
- Funny, dick.

19:35.927 --> 19:37.795
Just get your ass
over to Skyjacks, okay?

19:37.829 --> 19:39.063
Aiko wants all of us together.

19:39.096 --> 19:41.732
- Fine.
- All right. Later.

19:46.403 --> 19:47.972
My mocha!

20:03.187 --> 20:05.056
Oh, sweet. Thanks.
Thank you.

20:05.957 --> 20:08.059
So, what the fuck
are we doin' here?

20:08.092 --> 20:09.060
Ask these two.

20:10.695 --> 20:12.129
Just tell us why the fuck
we're here.

20:12.163 --> 20:14.131
Albert's been missing
for like 24 hours now.

20:14.165 --> 20:17.034
- Can we worry yet?
- Oh, my God. Not you too?

20:17.068 --> 20:20.071
I don't know, man.
What if it's not a joke?

20:21.005 --> 20:23.674
What if Wayne Hewitt
saw Albert's post

20:23.708 --> 20:27.611
about goin' to Viva Taco,
and went, and you know.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.547
No, no, there's absolutely
no way that Wayne Hewitt

20:30.580 --> 20:33.718
- killed Albert, okay?
- But anyone else could have?

20:33.751 --> 20:35.887
- What?
- How many people

20:35.920 --> 20:38.923
- are you connected to now?
- On InstaTalk?

20:39.824 --> 20:42.059
A hundred thousand or so.
I don't keep track.

20:42.093 --> 20:44.795
Exactly. And these are all
people you met in kindergarten?

20:44.829 --> 20:46.831
No, most of them
are total strangers.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.598
So?

20:48.632 --> 20:50.668
So if you're one
of those douches

20:50.701 --> 20:53.871
stupid enough to post everything
you do on social, which you are,

20:53.905 --> 20:55.639
and then you let them know
everything there's to know

20:55.673 --> 20:56.974
about you, which you do,

20:57.008 --> 20:58.876
how hard is it
for some random psycho

20:58.910 --> 21:01.212
to find out where you are,
where you're going,

21:01.245 --> 21:03.446
and when you're alone
and going to Viva Taco?

21:03.480 --> 21:05.917
- It could be anyone.
- Hey. You're being paranoid.

21:07.919 --> 21:10.655
- It's not that serious, dude.
- Hey.

21:12.089 --> 21:15.693
- Hey. I want to go.
- Where are you going?

21:15.726 --> 21:19.096
It was a long night.
I need a little stress relief.

21:19.931 --> 21:21.598
Oh, gotcha.

21:21.631 --> 21:24.769
Oh, don't forget,
my house, tomorrow,

21:24.802 --> 21:26.603
and it is a pool party, okay?

21:26.636 --> 21:28.839
So if anybody is thinking about
showing up

21:28.873 --> 21:31.608
dressed like Billie Eilish,
don't.

21:31.641 --> 21:34.812
I assume that's directed at me,
so yeah, go fuck yourself.

21:38.615 --> 21:40.117
Oh. Hey.

21:42.820 --> 21:45.189
What's up with Julie?
You two used to be tight.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.757
Used to be is right.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.628
- Hi, Sheriff Willard.
- Hi, Aiko.

21:51.662 --> 21:54.098
How's everyone doing? Enjoying
the last days of summer?

21:54.131 --> 21:55.766
Lovin' it.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.802
Jeremy, may I have a word
with you, please?

21:57.835 --> 21:59.236
I'm just drinkin' coffee.

21:59.270 --> 22:00.705
Now!

22:08.279 --> 22:09.880
I thought we understood
each other.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.249
You can be difficult
to understand.

22:12.283 --> 22:13.884
I, I don't speak pig.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.723
Listen, I can only imagine
how hard this is.

22:18.756 --> 22:21.192
Football star, scholarship.

22:21.826 --> 22:24.996
And now what? You can't let
that injury define you.

22:25.029 --> 22:27.898
There are other paths.
You were a winner.

22:28.332 --> 22:31.769
Oh, yeah? What am I now?

22:33.904 --> 22:35.139
Just...

22:35.940 --> 22:39.143
limit your activities here today
to just purchases.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.251
What was that all about?

22:47.284 --> 22:49.754
I don't know.
That guy's got it out for me.

22:49.787 --> 22:52.589
Whatever, Takeshi.
Tell him, Julie.

22:53.024 --> 22:56.260
Oh, um, the InstaTalk user
on Albert's video.

22:57.161 --> 22:58.896
It's 91418.

22:59.797 --> 23:01.564
Nine, one, four, eighteen.

23:01.598 --> 23:05.036
September 14, 2018.
That's when it happened.

23:05.069 --> 23:06.871
It's fucked, right?

23:07.872 --> 23:10.241
Beth, did you notice
who sent you that Albert clip?

23:10.274 --> 23:13.010
- Darrin has some goddamn nerve.
- Beth, focus!

23:13.044 --> 23:15.179
He acts like I'm not even here.

23:16.213 --> 23:18.949
- You wanna go? You ready?
- I just started my coffee!

23:18.983 --> 23:21.352
Just bring it with you.
We'll see you guys later, cool?

23:21.385 --> 23:23.620
You guys suck.

23:23.654 --> 23:24.855
See ya.

23:25.222 --> 23:26.857
Genius, have you forgotten,

23:26.891 --> 23:28.125
if Julie finds out
about you and Darrin

23:28.159 --> 23:29.693
she'll go straight to Tabitcha?

23:29.727 --> 23:31.028
Whatever!
How could he do this to me?

23:31.062 --> 23:33.596
Beth, Tabitha is easily
the hottest girl

23:33.630 --> 23:35.199
in Bell Fountain
since Ariana Grande's limo

23:35.232 --> 23:36.333
broke down on the freeway.

23:36.367 --> 23:38.002
He's not gonna dump her for you.

23:38.035 --> 23:39.870
And what's so wrong with me?

23:39.904 --> 23:42.139
Oh, my God!
Just treat it already.

23:42.173 --> 23:44.208
- You're being pathetic.
- I'm not pathetic.

23:44.241 --> 23:45.810
- Take that back.
- Please.

23:45.843 --> 23:47.912
The way he runs your ass
and the way he lets you?

23:47.945 --> 23:49.612
You're totally tragic.

23:49.646 --> 23:50.981
Oh, I am not pathetic!

23:51.015 --> 23:52.249
- What was that?
- I don't know.

23:56.053 --> 23:59.890
Sorry. Cannabis Central
closed at 4:19 today, so.

24:14.338 --> 24:15.773
Sorry, okay?

24:16.774 --> 24:18.175
This has never happened before.

24:24.415 --> 24:27.918
Oh, my God. I just cannot stop
thinking about Albert.

24:30.988 --> 24:32.356
You were thinking about Albert?

24:33.958 --> 24:35.159
That's not what I meant.

24:40.030 --> 24:41.098
Are you crying?

24:43.934 --> 24:47.271
Darrin, I had this boyfriend
when I moved here.

24:48.739 --> 24:51.709
We dated for a year before
I found out...

24:52.710 --> 24:54.211
he was fucking half the school.

24:54.245 --> 24:55.913
Everybody knew.

24:57.314 --> 24:59.016
It really messed me up.

25:01.385 --> 25:03.187
I went to therapy.

25:05.022 --> 25:07.224
Tabitha, I love you.

25:07.258 --> 25:11.829
Okay, I would never, ever
do anything like that to you.

25:14.398 --> 25:16.066
Now, maybe you should just
go home.

25:16.934 --> 25:18.469
I need to chill out
for a little bit.

25:18.502 --> 25:19.837
Are you gonna be on IT later?

25:20.471 --> 25:21.839
Yeah.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.142
- Okay, I guess.
- All right.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.172
Too needy.

26:04.148 --> 26:05.716
Too demanding.

26:13.157 --> 26:15.059
Hmm. Too lame.

26:25.369 --> 26:28.939
Honey, I'm leaving!
Please get to bed on time.

26:28.973 --> 26:31.342
- Thanks, Mom.
- Pizza delivery is on its way.

26:31.375 --> 26:34.111
- Bye!
- Thanks, Mom. Have fun!

27:00.237 --> 27:01.372
Mom?

27:03.607 --> 27:05.109
Mom?

28:10.974 --> 28:12.876
<i>I don't think Albert
would go on</i>

28:12.910 --> 28:14.178
<i>torturing us like this though.</i>

28:15.079 --> 28:17.648
<i>Well, you haven't known
him for as long as we have.</i>

28:17.682 --> 28:20.084
<i>Remember the ManQuest thing,
Jer?</i>

28:20.117 --> 28:22.186
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- <i>ManQuest?</i>

28:22.219 --> 28:24.355
Yeah, Al's debut
as a cyber terrorist

28:24.388 --> 28:26.623
was signing Jeremy up
for a gay dating service.

28:26.658 --> 28:28.992
<i>Yeah, I broke a few hearts
that month.</i>

28:29.026 --> 28:31.261
<i>I still get emails
of naked dudes like once a week</i>

28:31.295 --> 28:33.665
And you're not sharing this
because...?

28:33.698 --> 28:35.999
Well, then I get contacted
by a long-lost sister

28:36.033 --> 28:37.935
my parents gave up for adoption
when they were teens.

28:37.968 --> 28:40.604
You didn't fall
for that, did you?

28:40.637 --> 28:42.639
I took a bus
to the Garfield Monument

28:42.674 --> 28:46.110
and waited for hours until
he texted me with, "Gotcha."

28:46.143 --> 28:48.445
It was when InstaTalk
became a thing

28:48.479 --> 28:50.581
that his star began to shine.

28:50.614 --> 28:52.684
It was the first time he ever
really applied himself,

28:52.717 --> 28:56.286
and he was really, you know,
legit building a brand

28:56.320 --> 28:58.355
off of really clever
prank content.

28:58.389 --> 29:01.492
Videos of kids finding roadkill
on their doorstep isn't clever.

29:01.525 --> 29:04.395
No, it wasn't always
that extreme. It was...

29:06.997 --> 29:07.998
Never mind.

29:08.565 --> 29:10.501
No. What?

29:11.535 --> 29:13.270
- <i>Aiko.</i>
- <i>Wait. What?</i>

29:13.303 --> 29:14.238
<i>Aiko.</i>

29:15.472 --> 29:17.174
- Aiko?
- Yep.

29:17.207 --> 29:19.510
He wanted Aiko since
the first day of puberty.

29:19.543 --> 29:21.245
And she was all about
his content.

29:21.278 --> 29:22.946
You know Ai,
she loves that shit.

29:22.980 --> 29:25.249
And he loved her.
Still does, I think.

29:25.282 --> 29:28.085
So it was like he started doing
it more for her than himself.

29:28.118 --> 29:30.187
He was posting all the time,
creating moments.

29:30.220 --> 29:32.990
- Growing a following.
- Then Aiko met this YouTuber,

29:33.023 --> 29:35.092
Jenny, she had some crazy amount
of followers.

29:35.125 --> 29:38.962
And they hooked up and
Albert kinda became second best.

29:38.996 --> 29:40.597
And that's when the pranks
got dark.

29:41.398 --> 29:43.300
- Because he was hurt?
- <i>Fuck, no.</i>

29:43.333 --> 29:45.002
Because the more brutal
they were,

29:45.035 --> 29:46.303
the more people watched them,

29:46.336 --> 29:48.272
and liked them,
and all that shit.

29:48.305 --> 29:50.374
And in his head, the only way
he could show his value to Aiko

29:50.407 --> 29:53.243
was by increasing the eyeballs
and becoming greater than...

29:53.277 --> 29:54.712
whatever Jenny was.

29:54.746 --> 29:57.448
And he did that. But...

29:57.481 --> 30:00.050
<i>by that time,
Aiko was already all in.</i>

30:00.617 --> 30:02.754
Okay, did no one tell him
that Aiko was like

30:02.787 --> 30:05.055
- fully lesbianic?
- Right?

30:05.088 --> 30:08.425
Doesn't matter. He was so lost
in InstaTalk, and his new fans,

30:08.459 --> 30:11.628
and he really believed
that whatever sort of persona

30:11.663 --> 30:14.364
he could create online
was the key to winning Aiko.

30:14.398 --> 30:17.301
<i>And the content
got more intense until...</i>

30:22.105 --> 30:23.440
Until what?

30:24.709 --> 30:26.143
Hey, did you guys get that?

30:26.176 --> 30:28.278
Yeah, looks like a video.

30:28.813 --> 30:30.280
<i>Yeah, I got it too.</i>

30:30.782 --> 30:33.116
This should be good.

30:33.150 --> 30:35.720
<i>Care to go
for a swim, anyone?</i>

30:36.453 --> 30:38.355
Maybe we shouldn't open it.

30:38.388 --> 30:40.424
As if. It's probably just her
lip syncing

30:40.457 --> 30:43.193
<i>No Tears Left to Cry,</i>
or a selfie montage.

30:47.498 --> 30:49.533
- What the hell is that?
- Holy sh...

30:49.566 --> 30:52.135
- Shit!
- Dude, that's Aiko!

30:52.804 --> 30:54.404
Oh, my God!

31:35.312 --> 31:37.614
Why am I here?
I didn't do anything.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.349
Because
your phone was found

31:39.383 --> 31:40.685
at the scene of a crime.

31:44.889 --> 31:47.291
Don't touch me. I thought you
said I wasn't under arrest.

31:47.324 --> 31:48.826
Miss Hogart,
we just need to ask you

31:48.860 --> 31:50.360
- a few more questions.
- Take your hands off me.

31:50.394 --> 31:53.530
- Rape! Rape!
- Go inside, please!

32:09.313 --> 32:11.281
<i>Dr. Forest,
dial 182, please.</i>

32:13.818 --> 32:14.852
Sheriff.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.855
Take a seat.

32:21.258 --> 32:22.660
What brings you by? We're...

32:23.360 --> 32:25.562
not exactly on your
usual rounds here.

32:25.596 --> 32:27.264
A young man escaped
from here recently.

32:27.297 --> 32:28.900
And he has some connection
to a young woman

32:28.933 --> 32:30.233
that was just murdered.

32:30.267 --> 32:32.202
Yes, I saw the news reports.

32:32.235 --> 32:33.270
It's terrible.

32:33.738 --> 32:35.505
But I can't imagine Wayne Hewitt

32:35.539 --> 32:37.709
would have anything to do
with something like this.

32:37.742 --> 32:39.911
I assume that is
who you're asking about.

32:39.944 --> 32:42.346
I'm just chasing down
any lead that I can get.

32:42.379 --> 32:43.848
Then you haven't got any.

32:43.881 --> 32:47.551
Doc, why are kids today
so casual

32:47.584 --> 32:50.320
about telling the whole world,
total strangers,

32:50.354 --> 32:52.489
what they are up to
at any given moment?

32:52.522 --> 32:54.892
I mean, it all just seems to be
so goddamn stupid.

32:54.926 --> 32:56.460
I can stop you there, Sheriff.

32:58.395 --> 33:00.798
I mean, look at your first
response to this.

33:01.431 --> 33:02.834
Anger.

33:02.867 --> 33:04.736
These are just children.

33:04.769 --> 33:07.705
And the world we've given them
tells them that...

33:08.639 --> 33:13.276
validation, or even self-worth,
is to be found

33:13.310 --> 33:16.380
in the likes and clicks of
strangers on their smartphones.

33:16.413 --> 33:17.849
So what am I supposed to do?

33:17.882 --> 33:19.717
Take their phones
away from them?

33:19.751 --> 33:21.786
We both know you couldn't do
that even if you wanted to.

33:23.353 --> 33:25.555
I'm trying to monitor
the situation.

33:25.990 --> 33:28.525
And help these kids
in the way I know how.

33:28.558 --> 33:31.461
Wait. You're monitoring them?

33:31.996 --> 33:33.898
Everyone's
throwing up their lives

33:33.931 --> 33:35.565
for the whole world to see.

33:36.768 --> 33:39.336
I'm just looking in the doors
that have been left open.

33:40.437 --> 33:42.774
- You'll see.
- I hope you're right.

33:43.941 --> 33:45.175
Me too.

33:50.982 --> 33:52.684
Do you think she did it?

33:53.550 --> 33:56.286
What could Beth do to someone?
Tit fuck them to death?

33:56.319 --> 33:58.690
It's Wayne Hewitt.
I'd bet my left nut on it.

33:58.723 --> 34:01.224
The swollen one? No, thanks.

34:01.759 --> 34:03.695
Dude, don't you remember
this guy?

34:03.728 --> 34:06.396
Hewitt was a king dork, okay?
He couldn't take Julie down,

34:06.430 --> 34:08.933
let alone Albert,
and definitely not Aiko.

34:10.868 --> 34:13.470
Can't drag him into this
until we know for sure.

34:15.707 --> 34:17.441
It'll just make
everything worse.

34:17.474 --> 34:19.409
- Come on, come on!
- You with me?

34:19.443 --> 34:21.012
Shit! Goddamn clown.

34:21.045 --> 34:22.980
Are you playing
<i>Carnival Killers</i> right now?

34:23.014 --> 34:25.683
Jesus, Jeremy! Can you get your
head into what's happening

34:25.717 --> 34:27.384
to us for 1.5!

34:27.417 --> 34:29.252
You have no idea
where my head's at!

34:29.286 --> 34:32.289
- Forgive me for trying to relax.
- You can relax at my party.

34:32.322 --> 34:33.858
Your party?

34:33.891 --> 34:36.027
Dude, one of your best friends
was murdered last night.

34:36.060 --> 34:38.528
- You have to cancel it.
- Are you out of your mind?

34:38.896 --> 34:40.865
Even if I wanted to,
which I don't,

34:40.898 --> 34:42.700
my parents are back
in three days.

34:42.734 --> 34:45.870
- <i>Cancelling is not an option.</i>
- Well, that's gross.

34:45.903 --> 34:47.537
Obviously, I'll be there.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.373
Perfect.

34:53.310 --> 34:55.713
Perfect.

34:56.546 --> 34:59.050
Hey, I gotta go.
I'll see you at my house?

34:59.083 --> 35:01.418
<i>It's gonna be epic, dude.
You do not want to miss this.</i>

35:19.636 --> 35:21.538
Where are you, Wayne?

35:24.341 --> 35:25.642
Who is it?

35:25.676 --> 35:27.344
It's me, Jer. Let me in.

35:34.685 --> 35:36.386
Hey! What's up?

35:36.419 --> 35:37.955
"What's up"?
I'm totally freaking out.

35:37.989 --> 35:39.456
I'm staying with you
until my parents get back.

35:39.489 --> 35:41.591
No! No. Um, I mean, sure,

35:41.625 --> 35:43.493
but let... you know,
let's go to Darrin's party.

35:43.527 --> 35:45.763
- Can I change first?
- Just change at the party.

35:45.797 --> 35:47.965
- We'll... Yeah...
- What is going on with you?

35:47.999 --> 35:51.635
Nothin'. I just think Darrin
and Tabby are already there, so.

36:04.115 --> 36:05.917
So what did the cops
ask you?

36:05.950 --> 36:08.418
They asked me why
I didn't show up at Aiko's place

36:08.451 --> 36:10.655
with you guys. I mean, duh,
I lost my cellphone.

36:10.688 --> 36:12.489
How was I supposed to know
something happened?

36:12.522 --> 36:13.423
Yeah.

36:15.425 --> 36:16.961
You should have seen the way
they looked at me, Darrin.

36:16.994 --> 36:18.062
As if!

36:21.498 --> 36:23.600
Hey.

36:23.633 --> 36:24.936
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey.

36:24.969 --> 36:26.636
It's fine. It's okay.

36:27.672 --> 36:30.808
It's gonna be all right. Okay?
It's not that big a deal.

36:30.842 --> 36:32.409
It's gonna be fine.

36:35.079 --> 36:36.479
Oh.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.417
- No. No. No. No.
- Oh, my God, Darrin.

36:40.450 --> 36:42.519
- I love you so much.
- No, you don't.

36:44.789 --> 36:46.691
- Let's go back to my place.
- No!

36:46.724 --> 36:48.860
Okay. There's a full party going
on at my house right now, okay?

36:48.893 --> 36:50.427
You can't keep doing this to me.

36:50.460 --> 36:51.863
I need you, Darrin.

36:51.896 --> 36:53.630
Whenever you've wanted
or needed anything,

36:53.664 --> 36:55.933
I mean anything, I've done it.

36:55.967 --> 36:57.634
What's that creepy little bitch
ever done?

36:57.668 --> 36:59.402
Do not talk about her like that.

36:59.436 --> 37:00.872
Who the hell is she, anyway?

37:00.905 --> 37:02.940
One day you're all mine,
and the next day,

37:02.974 --> 37:05.508
a U-Haul pulls up,
Tabitha slithers out,

37:05.542 --> 37:07.078
and then you just toss me aside
like garbage.

37:07.111 --> 37:08.779
I mean, you don't even know her.

37:08.813 --> 37:10.647
- I know I love her.
- Right.

37:10.681 --> 37:12.817
Except for Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday

37:12.850 --> 37:14.417
when you're drilling me, right?

37:16.053 --> 37:17.587
Now, let's go.

37:55.226 --> 37:57.627
- Hey!
- You look so hot.

37:57.662 --> 37:59.964
Darrin's been looking for you.
He's over there.

38:00.665 --> 38:02.432
Oh, okay.

38:03.734 --> 38:06.469
Woo! Party! I love this song!

38:11.208 --> 38:13.844
This party couldn't be worse
if we were under quarantine.

38:14.679 --> 38:17.081
Do you think there's been
another outbreak?

38:17.114 --> 38:18.950
I mean,
I don't even see the host here.

38:18.983 --> 38:20.718
Did someone die or something?
Like...

38:20.751 --> 38:22.519
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

38:22.552 --> 38:25.555
Someone did die.
You guys seen Julie?

38:25.588 --> 38:27.892
- No.
- I don't even know anyone here.

38:27.925 --> 38:30.227
- Do you wanna take a selfie?
- Yeah, sure.

39:00.858 --> 39:02.994
There you are.

39:03.027 --> 39:04.862
Oh, my God. Kenzie, hey!

39:05.595 --> 39:08.498
I've been meaning to um,
you know, reach out.

39:09.566 --> 39:11.802
Julie, Aiko's memorial service
is in 30 minutes.

39:11.836 --> 39:14.805
And you're here, at a party.
What the hell is wrong with you?

39:15.773 --> 39:18.275
- Well, what are you doing here?
- I came to find you!

39:18.909 --> 39:20.878
I saw your IT post,
and I thought I could try

39:20.911 --> 39:23.681
- and talk some sense into you.
- Do you know where Darrin is?

39:23.714 --> 39:26.283
- No!
- What the fuck's your problem?

39:26.317 --> 39:29.820
My problem? My problems ended
the day I emancipated my ass

39:29.854 --> 39:32.923
- from you bitches.
- Who the fuck are you?

39:34.624 --> 39:36.861
You never even
mentioned me.

39:37.728 --> 39:38.796
I was you.

39:39.897 --> 39:42.133
Until Albert spiked
my Vitamin Water with Ex-Lax,

39:42.166 --> 39:44.969
stuck his camera under my stall,
and streamed it as a moment.

39:45.002 --> 39:47.872
I told you this would end badly,
Julie! I fucking told you!

39:47.905 --> 39:49.240
Calm down, Kenzie.

39:50.074 --> 39:52.843
Whatever. You know what?
Enjoy your fucking party.

39:53.778 --> 39:55.980
What the hell was that?

39:56.380 --> 39:57.882
Where the hell is Darrin?

39:57.915 --> 39:59.316
How is he not even
at his own party?

39:59.350 --> 40:01.752
I don't know! It's weird.
I'm texting him.

40:01.786 --> 40:03.654
I'm sure he's fine.

40:03.687 --> 40:04.955
Yeah.

40:07.091 --> 40:08.793
So are you guys gonna drink,

40:08.826 --> 40:09.860
- or...
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:09.894 --> 40:11.162
Yes, can you please make me one?

40:11.195 --> 40:12.797
Sure.

40:13.864 --> 40:15.699
You're so not old enough
to be here.

40:15.733 --> 40:17.802
Well.

40:18.302 --> 40:19.904
Bye, guys.

40:20.337 --> 40:22.339
You are so mean!

40:22.373 --> 40:24.675
- Where is he?
- Give it a rest.

40:24.708 --> 40:26.143
- You give it a rest!
- Would you two just stop?

40:26.177 --> 40:28.045
Stop what? I didn't do anything!

40:28.079 --> 40:30.147
Oh, really? Then why does
everyone seem to know something

40:30.181 --> 40:32.183
- that I don't?
- What?

40:32.216 --> 40:35.052
I'm serious. I mean, you both
have been acting so sus lately,

40:35.086 --> 40:37.221
and obviously keeping shit
from me.

40:37.888 --> 40:40.191
Like, who was that girl?
And Darrin?

40:40.224 --> 40:42.126
Darrin's like a whole
'nother person.

40:44.328 --> 40:45.963
What the hell, you guys?

40:45.996 --> 40:47.932
Look, Tabs,
this is all my fault.

40:47.965 --> 40:49.400
Okay? We are keeping
something from you.

40:49.433 --> 40:51.268
- Julie!
- Forget it, Jeremy.

40:51.302 --> 40:53.270
This has gone on long enough,
and you know it!

40:53.304 --> 40:54.939
Oh, they're having a bad day.

40:54.972 --> 40:57.174
Are you good?
Why are they yelling?

40:57.208 --> 41:00.144
Let's go somewhere private.
Come on.

41:17.728 --> 41:19.230
Wait. Wait, wait.

41:28.072 --> 41:29.273
Wait.

41:30.908 --> 41:32.409
- Stop!
- What the hell, Darrin?

41:32.443 --> 41:34.879
- Listen to me!
- What the fuck?

41:40.818 --> 41:44.889
- What's up?
- Look. I care about you.

41:44.922 --> 41:46.323
Okay? We've had a lot of fun.

41:46.357 --> 41:48.292
But I don't wanna do this
anymore.

41:48.325 --> 41:49.994
I don't know

41:50.027 --> 41:51.962
how much more obvious
I could possibly be.

42:00.404 --> 42:02.106
What the fuck are you doing,
Darrin?

42:02.139 --> 42:04.175
What the fuck?

42:06.477 --> 42:08.245
What the fuck?
You're so pathetic.

42:23.294 --> 42:27.198
Woo-hoo! Yeah! Go! All right!

42:31.268 --> 42:34.471
Okay, so there's this kid
named Wayne Hewitt.

42:34.505 --> 42:37.775
And you've never met him because
he's been in a mental hospital

42:37.808 --> 42:41.745
since we did something terrible
to him.

42:43.881 --> 42:46.984
- Care to take over?
- Fine.

42:48.152 --> 42:50.087
Albert had always
picked on Wayne.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.756
When Wayne got to Bell High
his freshman year,

42:52.790 --> 42:54.992
he dodged Al like he had
the Coronavirus.

42:55.392 --> 42:58.829
Al wouldn't have it. Kept
talking about this masterpiece,

42:58.862 --> 43:01.065
and how Wayne
was gonna be the star.

43:01.098 --> 43:04.768
So one night, Darrin made Beth
call Wayne over to her place...

43:04.802 --> 43:07.504
- Why'd Beth listen to Darrin?
- Do you wanna hear this?

43:08.839 --> 43:11.275
She called Wayne over, and...

43:15.980 --> 43:17.081
we grabbed him.

43:21.352 --> 43:23.887
<i>We took him to this place
Albert knew about.</i>

43:23.921 --> 43:26.957
<i>Some abandoned property
outside of town.</i>

43:28.259 --> 43:31.128
<i>Darrin and I were there,
shooting live on our phones.</i>

43:31.161 --> 43:34.298
<i>Albert, he was running the show</i>

43:35.399 --> 43:39.236
<i>Streaming the whole thing live
as an InstaTalk moment.</i>

43:39.270 --> 43:42.273
<i>It was a real production.
I mean, he even had a drone.</i>

43:43.040 --> 43:44.842
<i>And everyone was watching</i>

43:44.875 --> 43:48.212
<i>Albert's prank video
masterpiece.</i>

43:52.316 --> 43:54.051
<i>People were betting on how long
it would take Wayne to crack.</i>

43:55.552 --> 43:56.987
<i>Which he did.</i>

43:57.621 --> 44:02.092
I didn't do anything.
Stop. Stop!

44:02.126 --> 44:03.260
I didn't do anything. Stop!

44:03.294 --> 44:05.362
<i>And then it got to this place</i>

44:05.396 --> 44:07.398
<i>where it just
wasn't cool anymore.</i>

44:07.431 --> 44:10.000
Boo!

44:10.034 --> 44:12.069
<i>Albert crossed a line.</i>

44:12.102 --> 44:13.504
Smile, you're on camera!

44:13.537 --> 44:14.972
<i>I don't think
he ever looked back.</i>

44:16.907 --> 44:18.942
<i>Streaming the whole thing live
as an InstaTalk moment,</i>

44:18.976 --> 44:21.545
<i>and everyone was watching.</i>

44:23.947 --> 44:27.851
So you guys hate crimed
an LGBTQ person of color.

44:27.885 --> 44:30.287
What century are you in
to think that that was okay?

44:30.321 --> 44:31.622
It was all Albert's idea.

44:31.656 --> 44:33.891
Maybe because Aiko went gay
on him.

44:33.924 --> 44:35.492
That excuse is pathetic.

44:37.261 --> 44:39.997
- So what happened next?
- The police got involved.

44:41.332 --> 44:44.134
We all convinced Aiko
to convince Albert

44:44.168 --> 44:46.036
to take the fall for it.

44:46.070 --> 44:49.406
He still loved her, and it was
his stupid idea anyway.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.543
The moment had passed,
and there wasn't really any proof.

44:52.576 --> 44:54.378
So you throw Albert
under the bus,

44:54.411 --> 44:56.914
and he gets off because
this is America.

44:56.947 --> 44:59.316
Meanwhile, the victim
gets institutionalized.

44:59.350 --> 45:02.252
And do you sociopaths even feel
a tinge of guilt here?

45:02.286 --> 45:03.987
Whatever. Karma's a bitch.

45:04.021 --> 45:05.923
And two months later,
I blow out my knee.

45:05.956 --> 45:08.660
- Lost my scholarship.
- Poor fucking you, Jeremy.

45:08.693 --> 45:11.895
Of course, we feel bad, okay?

45:11.929 --> 45:14.298
We made a pact never to tell
anyone about what we did.

45:14.331 --> 45:15.599
Or about Wayne.

45:16.166 --> 45:17.634
And so how is he now?

45:20.003 --> 45:22.005
He escaped from Sunnybrook.

45:23.173 --> 45:25.542
I can't believe you never
told me any of this.

45:25.576 --> 45:27.911
I mean, I'm in actual danger
just knowing you.

45:27.945 --> 45:31.315
Okay. There's still no proof
that it's Wayne.

45:31.348 --> 45:33.050
You terrorized this kid so much

45:33.083 --> 45:35.185
that he was committed
to a nuthouse!

45:35.219 --> 45:37.921
And now, he's out,
and people are dying!

45:38.422 --> 45:40.591
- What more proof do you need?
- Okay, sure.

45:40.624 --> 45:42.626
But Wayne obviously
wants to talk,

45:42.660 --> 45:44.561
so let's give him a chance
to come forward

45:44.595 --> 45:46.497
before we go sounding
any alarms.

45:47.431 --> 45:49.400
Look, we've done so much
to this kid.

45:49.433 --> 45:51.435
Before we go on a witch hunt,
we need to make sure it's him.

45:51.468 --> 45:52.936
Right?

45:53.437 --> 45:56.173
Well, it's been fun.
But I have some shit to do.

45:56.206 --> 45:58.175
Tell Darrin he's an ass
for missing his own party.

45:58.208 --> 46:00.644
Hey, where are you going?
I'm staying with you, right?

46:00.678 --> 46:02.179
You should stay with Tabitha.

46:02.212 --> 46:04.148
Actually, you two stay together.
I'm out.

46:06.150 --> 46:08.152
It's your fault she knows.

46:08.185 --> 46:10.954
And now you have to make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.328
- Tabitha, wait!
- You know I have a hard time

46:18.362 --> 46:20.297
- trusting people.
- I should have told you.

46:20.330 --> 46:21.965
What did he mean about Darrin
making Beth

46:21.999 --> 46:24.301
- call that kid to her place?
- Back then,

46:24.334 --> 46:26.704
Beth and Darrin had this friends
with benefits thing going on.

46:26.738 --> 46:28.305
But look, she wound up
obsessed with him,

46:28.338 --> 46:30.207
and he dumped her.
It's ancient history.

46:30.240 --> 46:33.143
Really? Or is there something
else you're not telling me?

46:33.177 --> 46:36.647
Whoa, Tabby. I shouldn't have
kept this Hewitt thing from you,

46:36.681 --> 46:39.049
but I would tell you if Darrin
was messing around on you.

46:39.684 --> 46:42.687
I would. Look, Darrin is not
that asshole you were with

46:42.720 --> 46:44.488
before you came here, okay?

46:45.255 --> 46:47.991
He worships you.
He's really vain,

46:48.025 --> 46:49.593
and you're the hottest girl
ever.

46:49.626 --> 46:51.428
Shut up.

46:51.462 --> 46:54.631
Look at me. You've been
through some real shit.

46:55.733 --> 46:57.267
You can believe me
when I tell you

46:57.301 --> 46:59.036
Darrin is not cheating on you.

46:59.470 --> 47:00.404
Okay?

47:02.172 --> 47:04.174
Can I have a hug.

47:04.208 --> 47:05.576
- Yeah.
- Oh.

47:05.609 --> 47:08.178
- I hate you, Julie.
- I love you more.

47:32.670 --> 47:35.138
Beth. Hey.

48:08.572 --> 48:10.641
Yes, Daddy. Yes, Daddy.

48:10.675 --> 48:13.143
Oh, my God, Daddy.

48:13.176 --> 48:15.345
Yeah. Call me Daddy.
Call me Daddy again.

48:15.379 --> 48:19.550
Yeah, Daddy. Yeah, Daddy.

48:29.126 --> 48:30.627
Oh, that was incredible.

48:34.231 --> 48:36.868
I gotta go. I gotta go.

48:36.901 --> 48:38.168
Really?

48:46.844 --> 48:49.747
You know, like, maybe we should,
should we talk about this?

48:49.781 --> 48:52.416
Can I, can I call you sometime?

48:52.449 --> 48:54.852
Talk about it. Um...

48:55.586 --> 48:58.188
Uh, thanks.

49:00.157 --> 49:00.858
"Thanks"?

49:03.594 --> 49:05.295
Hey, sexy. I got your text.

49:07.431 --> 49:10.467
Peter. Peter? Peter?

49:10.500 --> 49:12.704
Peter? Peter!

49:15.238 --> 49:17.341
Darrin's
all tied up at the moment.

49:31.321 --> 49:32.389
<i>Hello?</i>

49:33.624 --> 49:34.826
<i>Hello?</i>

49:37.527 --> 49:38.830
Where am I?

49:39.664 --> 49:41.632
Aw, shit. Where am I?

49:42.834 --> 49:44.167
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

49:45.970 --> 49:47.204
Hello?

49:53.644 --> 49:54.679
Hello?

49:56.246 --> 49:57.280
Who's there?

49:58.515 --> 49:59.884
Where am I?

50:03.253 --> 50:05.589
Help me! Help me!

50:18.770 --> 50:20.203
Oh, my God.

51:23.366 --> 51:25.402
Did I do it right?

51:25.435 --> 51:27.404
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

51:27.437 --> 51:29.874
Oh, we got a moment.

51:29.907 --> 51:32.910
<i>Welcome
to the death of Beth.</i>

51:36.580 --> 51:38.850
- <i>Help me!</i>
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

51:42.053 --> 51:44.421
Oh, my God! Who sent this?

51:44.454 --> 51:47.557
Uh... It says it's coming
from Darrin.

51:47.992 --> 51:50.527
Here, I can find him
on my Find a Friend app.

51:53.030 --> 51:54.866
Let's go. Come on!

51:55.632 --> 51:58.335
Tabitha?

52:01.605 --> 52:03.674
Tabitha, what was that?
I heard a loud bang.

52:08.679 --> 52:10.848
Tabitha?

52:20.925 --> 52:22.292
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

52:24.061 --> 52:25.362
Who's there?

52:25.395 --> 52:26.563
<i>Sit down.</i>

52:30.067 --> 52:32.804
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna call the police.

52:33.603 --> 52:36.540
- <i>Call me Daddy again.</i>
- <i>Yeah, Daddy.</i>

52:36.573 --> 52:39.944
<i>Yeah, Daddy.</i>

52:39.977 --> 52:42.046
<i>To use a
reference more age appropriate</i>

52:42.079 --> 52:45.883
<i>for you than Beth,
can you hear me now?</i>

52:45.917 --> 52:48.953
<i>With a single keystroke, your
new InstaTalk page goes live</i>

52:48.986 --> 52:51.689
<i>along with the moment you
have fantasized about for years</i>

52:51.722 --> 52:54.357
<i>How was it... Daddy?</i>

52:54.391 --> 52:56.459
You don't know a damn thing
about me.

52:56.493 --> 52:58.461
<i>I actually
know quite a bit.</i>

52:58.495 --> 53:00.597
<i>When was the last time you
deleted your browser history?</i>

53:02.399 --> 53:04.001
<i>How about deleting your cookies</i>

53:05.102 --> 53:06.938
<i>For a man
who was fully cognitive</i>

53:06.971 --> 53:08.605
<i>when the internet
went mainstream,</i>

53:08.638 --> 53:10.540
<i>you sure have been sloppy.</i>

53:10.574 --> 53:12.375
Oh, God.

53:12.409 --> 53:14.411
<i>How about
the stuff you downloaded</i>

53:14.444 --> 53:16.479
<i>from that Venezuelan porn site?</i>

53:16.513 --> 53:17.715
Oh, please God.

53:18.816 --> 53:20.550
<i>When your
InstaTalk page goes live,</i>

53:20.584 --> 53:23.587
<i>everyone you know
will now know you as this man.</i>

53:23.620 --> 53:26.157
<i>All the data,
all leads back to you.</i>

53:26.190 --> 53:27.692
Please, stop.

53:33.164 --> 53:35.132
<i>Are you sure
she was 18?</i>

53:35.166 --> 53:37.001
I mean, what do you want
from me?

53:38.602 --> 53:40.171
<i>The questions
I'd be asking are</i>

53:40.204 --> 53:42.840
<i>who took that video of me
fucking Beth?</i>

53:42.874 --> 53:44.709
<i>And did they leave?</i>

54:10.201 --> 54:12.837
- You think she's dead?
- I don't know.

54:12.870 --> 54:15.740
- What is this place?
- I'm not sure. But wait.

54:15.773 --> 54:17.507
Wait, I think I recognize that.

54:17.540 --> 54:18.976
Would you pay
attention to the app?

54:19.010 --> 54:22.445
- Which way?
- Up here. Make a right.

54:22.479 --> 54:24.749
Should be just up ahead.
Pull over.

54:24.782 --> 54:25.683
Okay.

54:28.986 --> 54:31.188
- Darrin?
- Darrin?

54:33.858 --> 54:35.693
Whoa.

54:36.493 --> 54:38.863
<i>Your boyfriend's
been a naughty boy.</i>

54:39.596 --> 54:43.034
- After everything I told you?
- No, I didn't know.

54:43.067 --> 54:44.936
I didn't... Wait! Tabby!

54:45.568 --> 54:47.972
Please, please! You have
to believe me, I didn't know!

54:48.005 --> 54:50.573
Why? Why should I?
You lie about everything!

54:50.607 --> 54:53.144
No, not this, okay? I wouldn't.

54:53.177 --> 54:55.813
- Is that blood?
- Oh, my God.

54:55.846 --> 54:57.848
- Open the trunk.
- Um...

55:02.186 --> 55:04.922
Oh, my God! Beth!

55:08.292 --> 55:09.592
Oh, my God!

55:10.995 --> 55:13.496
- Tabitha! Tabitha, wait!
- Fuck you!

55:13.530 --> 55:15.066
I'm dropping you off
at your boyfriend's.

55:15.099 --> 55:16.867
You two deserve each other.

55:16.901 --> 55:18.568
<i>Leave a message.</i>

55:18.601 --> 55:20.137
Jeremy,
something really bad happened.

55:20.171 --> 55:22.974
You need to call me.
Tabby ran off, and left me here.

55:23.741 --> 55:26.911
Jeremy, please call me back.
I'm at your house.

55:51.268 --> 55:52.770
You gotta be kidding me.

56:13.991 --> 56:15.159
Don't move!

56:16.193 --> 56:18.595
Julie. Oh, shit.

56:18.628 --> 56:20.597
- Honey.
- Who the hell are you, Jeremy?

56:20.630 --> 56:22.233
Do I even know you anymore?

56:22.266 --> 56:24.567
I needed it. It's for my knee.

56:25.369 --> 56:27.905
You needed it? There's
a shitload of baggies there,

56:27.938 --> 56:29.907
and a fucking scale!
Do you think I'm an idiot?

56:29.940 --> 56:32.276
- You're overreacting.
- Overreacting?

56:33.010 --> 56:35.578
You had a gun to my face,
asshole!

56:36.047 --> 56:37.815
Where did you even
get that thing?

56:37.848 --> 56:39.717
I got it at a gun show.

56:39.750 --> 56:42.053
Actually, I got two of them
because of the shit going on.

56:42.086 --> 56:43.821
What are you even doing here?

56:45.256 --> 56:46.623
Beth is dead.

56:47.191 --> 56:49.060
What? How?

56:49.794 --> 56:52.830
Tabby and I found her body
in the trunk of Darrin's car.

56:55.132 --> 56:56.367
Where's Tabitha now?

56:56.400 --> 56:58.702
I don't know. She hates me.

56:58.736 --> 57:01.604
Beth and Darrin have been
screwing this entire time.

57:01.638 --> 57:02.940
Can you believe that?

57:07.311 --> 57:08.712
Did you know?

57:11.882 --> 57:13.784
You knew,
and you didn't tell me?

57:13.818 --> 57:15.753
- You would have told Tabitha.
- Yeah.

57:15.786 --> 57:17.788
That's kind of the whole point!

57:18.823 --> 57:22.259
God! I came here because I
don't have anywhere else to go.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.162
What am I supposed to do now?

57:25.863 --> 57:30.633
Stay with me. All right?
It's safe. It's okay.

57:30.668 --> 57:34.071
- Get away from me.
- No, no. We, we'll be safe.

57:35.005 --> 57:36.974
I'll sleep on the floor.

57:39.677 --> 57:40.778
Fine.

57:41.846 --> 57:43.881
It's okay, come on.
Let's go back to the house.

57:43.914 --> 57:45.049
Don't touch me.

59:07.765 --> 59:09.733
Come on. Come on. Come on.

59:13.771 --> 59:15.139
Oh, yeah.

59:27.952 --> 59:29.453
Whew!

59:30.120 --> 59:32.056
Oh!

59:35.960 --> 59:37.728
You hear that, Darrin?

59:40.464 --> 59:43.133
Oh, Darrin?

59:48.305 --> 59:50.140
Shit.

59:54.044 --> 59:54.979
Hey, Darrin?

59:56.046 --> 59:57.381
It's me, Albert, man.

59:58.148 --> 59:59.416
Everything's all right now.

1:00:14.231 --> 1:00:15.466
Darrin's gone.

1:00:15.499 --> 1:00:18.235
I, I don't know. He's just gone.

1:00:19.570 --> 1:00:20.804
What do we do?

1:00:21.839 --> 1:00:23.907
Dad, please call me back.

1:00:23.941 --> 1:00:25.242
ASAP.

1:00:26.210 --> 1:00:27.878
I need you to come home.

1:00:29.046 --> 1:00:30.414
I love you.

1:00:36.620 --> 1:00:39.089
Darrin.
If you're rushing off

1:00:39.123 --> 1:00:42.092
for a secret booty call
with Beth, I have bad news.

1:00:42.126 --> 1:00:44.061
It's not a secret anymore.

1:00:44.094 --> 1:00:46.130
Oh, and Beth's dead.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.403
Julie!

1:00:53.203 --> 1:00:54.204
Hey, Julie.

1:00:58.909 --> 1:01:01.979
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
freaked out on you at the party.

1:01:02.012 --> 1:01:04.114
You really don't deserve
any of this.

1:01:04.148 --> 1:01:05.382
It's okay.

1:01:05.416 --> 1:01:07.951
Everything
just got carried away.

1:01:07.985 --> 1:01:09.253
'Cause of InstaTalk.

1:01:09.286 --> 1:01:12.389
I'm supposed to wait
to kill you,

1:01:12.423 --> 1:01:14.992
all part of a little
secret plan.

1:01:23.133 --> 1:01:24.868
Pretty much.

1:01:24.902 --> 1:01:26.470
Hey. When this is all over,

1:01:26.503 --> 1:01:29.206
can we please make this right?
'Cause I miss you.

1:01:29.239 --> 1:01:31.008
I miss you too.

1:01:34.144 --> 1:01:35.546
I gotta go. Call me.

1:01:39.216 --> 1:01:41.285
Payback.

1:01:41.318 --> 1:01:43.620
For when you let me
take it in the ass

1:01:43.655 --> 1:01:45.489
for everything
that we did together.

1:01:45.522 --> 1:01:47.024
You remember that?

1:02:21.392 --> 1:02:22.960
- Hello?
- <i>Julie!</i>

1:02:22.993 --> 1:02:24.328
<i>You need to come
to my house now!</i>

1:02:24.361 --> 1:02:26.163
I'm freaking out.

1:02:26.196 --> 1:02:27.665
Okay, I'm coming right now.

1:02:35.339 --> 1:02:37.141
Hey, what are you doing here?

1:02:52.990 --> 1:02:54.458
Tabitha?

1:02:57.662 --> 1:02:58.663
Tabby?

1:03:07.504 --> 1:03:08.673
Tabitha?

1:03:11.608 --> 1:03:13.043
Tabitha?

1:03:48.078 --> 1:03:49.279
Tabitha?

1:03:52.216 --> 1:03:53.383
Tabitha?

1:03:54.786 --> 1:03:57.454
Tabitha?

1:04:06.798 --> 1:04:08.398
Tabitha?

1:04:10.067 --> 1:04:11.335
Tabitha?

1:04:21.311 --> 1:04:22.814
- Jeremy?
- Hey.

1:04:22.847 --> 1:04:24.448
You were gone when I woke up.
Where are you?

1:04:24.481 --> 1:04:25.683
Jeremy.

1:04:25.717 --> 1:04:27.251
Are you okay?

1:04:27.284 --> 1:04:29.052
I'm at Tabitha's.
But she's not here.

1:04:29.086 --> 1:04:32.189
And... Peter's dead.

1:04:32.222 --> 1:04:33.825
Jesus! Get out of there.

1:04:33.858 --> 1:04:36.360
Go to my place,
lock yourself in. The gu...

1:04:36.393 --> 1:04:38.095
The gun
is in the nightstand.

1:04:38.830 --> 1:04:40.531
Don't open the door for anyone.

1:04:40.564 --> 1:04:41.699
Jeremy.

1:04:41.733 --> 1:04:43.267
Just go, I'll be there soon.

1:04:43.801 --> 1:04:45.269
Wait.

1:05:55.807 --> 1:05:57.775
<i>So, Julie,
care to play</i>

1:05:57.809 --> 1:05:58.810
a game?

1:06:56.934 --> 1:06:58.468
No!

1:06:58.502 --> 1:06:59.937
Julie!

1:06:59.971 --> 1:07:00.905
Don't!

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:10.580
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Jeremy.

1:07:10.614 --> 1:07:12.315
<i>I'm locked in the bathroom.
Wayne's here and he has a gun.</i>

1:07:12.349 --> 1:07:13.550
- <i>Please help me!</i>
- <i>What?</i>

1:07:13.583 --> 1:07:14.886
<i>I'm almost there!</i>

1:07:14.919 --> 1:07:16.688
Julie, please
listen to me.

1:07:16.721 --> 1:07:17.955
I need to find Jeremy.

1:07:18.923 --> 1:07:20.557
Please, just hear me out.

1:07:22.426 --> 1:07:23.828
Okay, okay, I'm listening.

1:07:24.996 --> 1:07:26.463
I met someone online.

1:07:26.898 --> 1:07:28.532
Good for you. Who hasn't?

1:07:28.565 --> 1:07:29.867
No, you don't understand!

1:07:30.467 --> 1:07:32.469
They said that they're coming
to kill me.

1:07:33.603 --> 1:07:35.272
Look, I,
I thought it was Albert.

1:07:35.305 --> 1:07:37.607
I got so scared that I ran away,
and I hid.

1:07:38.308 --> 1:07:41.378
<i>So you hate crimed
an LGBTQ person of color.</i>

1:07:41.411 --> 1:07:44.414
<i>And do you sociopaths even feel
a tinge of guilt here?</i>

1:07:56.626 --> 1:07:57.527
No!

1:08:02.365 --> 1:08:04.434
No, no, no, no!
Don't get any closer!

1:08:04.468 --> 1:08:06.971
- It's okay.
- He said your name.

1:08:07.004 --> 1:08:09.506
Julie, he was crazy.
I was probably next on his list.

1:08:11.441 --> 1:08:12.677
I'm putting it down, okay?

1:08:15.780 --> 1:08:17.982
It's me. Okay?

1:08:18.750 --> 1:08:20.685
It's okay.

1:08:20.718 --> 1:08:22.385
It's okay. It's just me.

1:08:22.419 --> 1:08:24.756
I'm here. I'm here. It's okay.

1:08:24.789 --> 1:08:26.924
Come here. Come here.

1:08:28.592 --> 1:08:31.294
Shh. It's okay.

1:08:32.329 --> 1:08:33.798
It's okay. I'm here.

1:08:39.603 --> 1:08:41.471
We're still
looking for your friend.

1:08:41.505 --> 1:08:43.406
Tabitha. We'll find her.

1:08:44.041 --> 1:08:47.310
I want to go home.
Can we go home now?

1:08:47.344 --> 1:08:48.780
- Yes. Yes. Go.
- Can we please go?

1:09:10.001 --> 1:09:11.669
I gave the plants away.

1:09:12.737 --> 1:09:14.371
Yeah, to my cousin.

1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:18.542
I really did start growing them
for the pain in my knee.

1:09:20.711 --> 1:09:23.580
I wasn't gonna get hooked
on meds I couldn't afford.

1:09:23.613 --> 1:09:25.615
And it helped
with the depression, too.

1:09:30.487 --> 1:09:31.454
So I...

1:09:33.456 --> 1:09:34.992
made a bunch of extra,
and you know,

1:09:35.026 --> 1:09:36.661
sold what I didn't use.

1:09:37.594 --> 1:09:39.997
I could pay rent, and be normal.

1:09:41.766 --> 1:09:43.067
I didn't tell you because...

1:09:44.467 --> 1:09:47.772
I, I, I can't lose you.

1:09:49.173 --> 1:09:51.374
You're the last good thing
I have left.

1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:04.922
It's my dad.

1:10:22.606 --> 1:10:23.607
Julie?

1:10:24.608 --> 1:10:26.043
- Julie, wait.
- Jeremy, go away!

1:10:26.077 --> 1:10:27.778
If you don't go away
I'm gonna call the cops!

1:10:32.750 --> 1:10:34.018
What the fuck, Julie?

1:10:35.452 --> 1:10:36.687
Julie!

1:10:38.455 --> 1:10:40.758
What are you doing? Jesus!

1:10:41.759 --> 1:10:42.994
What the f...

1:10:53.570 --> 1:10:54.705
Julie?

1:11:01.212 --> 1:11:02.445
Julie.

1:11:03.247 --> 1:11:04.949
Don't leave me.

1:12:16.721 --> 1:12:18.588
<i>Shut up.
If you don't stop being a douche</i>

1:12:18.621 --> 1:12:20.191
<i>and start drumming up some tears
you won't be touching</i>

1:12:20.224 --> 1:12:21.859
<i>an inch of my body. Got it?</i>

1:12:23.861 --> 1:12:25.730
- <i>Hey.</i>
- What the hell?

1:12:25.763 --> 1:12:27.064
- <i>Start crying. Cry.</i>
- <i>All right. Go back.</i>

1:12:27.098 --> 1:12:27.999
<i>Stop.</i>

1:12:29.066 --> 1:12:29.967
<i>All right.</i>

1:12:31.202 --> 1:12:33.738
<i>I don't know. I feel like this
isn't gonna look believable.</i>

1:12:33.771 --> 1:12:35.806
<i>No, no. Trust me. I'm just
gonna punch it afterwards</i>

1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:37.908
<i>we're gonna light it up,
it'll be perfect. Trust me.</i>

1:12:37.942 --> 1:12:39.977
<i>You just gotta make sure
you make good on...</i>

1:12:41.578 --> 1:12:43.080
<i>...whatever she actually pays..</i>

1:12:43.114 --> 1:12:45.983
No. This doesn't make any sense.

1:13:07.071 --> 1:13:08.706
Why are you doing this?

1:13:09.774 --> 1:13:11.175
But I didn't know.

1:13:23.653 --> 1:13:26.657
Tabitha, please, I love you.
Talk to me.

1:13:33.864 --> 1:13:36.000
Where are you, you crazy bitch?

1:13:36.033 --> 1:13:37.600
Behind you.

1:13:55.052 --> 1:13:56.887
Looking for these?

1:14:36.827 --> 1:14:37.895
Hi, Jules.

1:14:38.896 --> 1:14:40.097
<i>I know you're listening.</i>

1:14:41.832 --> 1:14:43.667
You wanted to talk.
Well, here I am.

1:14:44.368 --> 1:14:46.070
You know what I want
to talk about?

1:14:47.338 --> 1:14:48.806
I want to talk about you.

1:14:49.707 --> 1:14:51.208
<i>And your terrible friends.</i>

1:14:52.343 --> 1:14:55.346
The kind of people that ruin
people like Wayne Hewitt

1:14:55.379 --> 1:14:57.314
just to make yourselves
feel better.

1:14:58.382 --> 1:14:59.917
<i>You know what the truth is?</i>

1:15:00.351 --> 1:15:02.353
Anyone can do what you do.

1:15:03.053 --> 1:15:04.889
Really, trust me.

1:15:06.323 --> 1:15:08.425
<i>You just starve yourself
beautiful.</i>

1:15:08.459 --> 1:15:10.828
And make a million new friends
on InstaTalk.

1:15:12.029 --> 1:15:15.866
And all of a sudden,
all the horrible people

1:15:16.367 --> 1:15:19.470
that are so mean to everyone,
will start eating

1:15:19.503 --> 1:15:21.405
<i>out of the palm of your hand.</i>

1:15:22.173 --> 1:15:25.075
You all made it so easy
for me to get you

1:15:25.109 --> 1:15:27.077
exactly where I wanted you.

1:15:27.111 --> 1:15:29.480
<i>You tell InstaTalk everything.</i>

1:15:29.513 --> 1:15:32.283
And you believe everything
it tells you.

1:15:39.156 --> 1:15:40.858
It's amazing
what you can accomplish

1:15:40.891 --> 1:15:42.993
with just one stupid
little app these days.

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:58.002
Hello, gorgeous.

1:16:58.936 --> 1:17:00.304
Nowhere left to run.

1:17:00.337 --> 1:17:02.539
Bitch!

1:17:31.902 --> 1:17:33.270
This ends now, bitch!

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:04.101
Hey.

1:18:05.536 --> 1:18:06.437
Hi, there.

1:18:52.649 --> 1:18:54.918
My team and I have done
all we can for Tabitha.

1:18:57.955 --> 1:19:00.057
When this stranger approached
her on InstaTalk,

1:19:00.090 --> 1:19:02.025
he proposed a way for her
to get revenge

1:19:02.059 --> 1:19:03.927
on all the people
who had hurt her.

1:19:03.961 --> 1:19:05.963
Well, you know how
these creeps operate.

1:19:07.398 --> 1:19:08.999
She never even met him
in person,

1:19:09.032 --> 1:19:12.069
but saw him as some sort
of... a soulmate.

1:19:12.102 --> 1:19:13.604
Someone who truly
understood her.

1:19:15.506 --> 1:19:17.274
Loved her, even.

1:19:17.307 --> 1:19:19.711
There's absolutely no way
to track down this person?

1:19:19.744 --> 1:19:21.178
All we have is
his sign off.

1:19:21.612 --> 1:19:24.181
He ends every conversation
with an emoji.

1:19:24.214 --> 1:19:26.450
An eye, a die, like in dice,

1:19:27.217 --> 1:19:29.386
the roman numeral four,
and a sheep.

1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:31.955
What does that mean?

1:19:31.989 --> 1:19:35.359
"I die for you."

1:19:37.628 --> 1:19:38.529
How odd.

1:19:39.764 --> 1:19:41.131
It is.

1:19:41.666 --> 1:19:43.033
Doctors.

1:19:47.037 --> 1:19:49.039
He told her
he would reveal himself

1:19:49.072 --> 1:19:51.175
as soon as she killed
all of her friends.

1:19:52.075 --> 1:19:54.578
As you can see,
she's still waiting.

1:19:56.046 --> 1:19:57.581
Did you know
that the corporation

1:19:57.614 --> 1:19:59.684
that owns this institution

1:19:59.717 --> 1:20:02.186
pays a fee to InstaTalk's
parent company?

1:20:03.253 --> 1:20:06.390
It lets us access and monitor
all the moments and deets

1:20:06.423 --> 1:20:09.661
InstaTalk uses,
they just disappear.

1:20:10.527 --> 1:20:11.696
I had no idea.

1:20:12.931 --> 1:20:17.401
We have such power to influence
young people's behavior now.

1:20:21.673 --> 1:20:23.440
Thank you, Dr. Flynn,
I'll take it from here.

1:20:27.712 --> 1:20:30.180
Hello, Tabitha. I'm Dr. Yates.

1:20:30.214 --> 1:20:33.116
I'm an expert in dealing with
young people who've suffered

1:20:33.150 --> 1:20:35.152
certain humiliations.

1:20:35.185 --> 1:20:39.022
I know such traumas can seem
impossible to let go of.

1:20:40.123 --> 1:20:42.727
Good luck.
She's a handful.

1:20:53.437 --> 1:20:54.739
I'd die for you.

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:05.048
It's you.

1:21:05.649 --> 1:21:07.084
It's really you.

1:21:09.653 --> 1:21:12.422
No. Not here. Not now. Soon.

1:21:15.125 --> 1:21:17.394
Well, when can,
when can I get out of here?

1:21:18.195 --> 1:21:20.631
And we can be together
like you promised.

1:21:21.465 --> 1:21:25.435
Don't you see? We've already
been through so much together.

1:21:26.671 --> 1:21:28.438
When Wayne Hewitt first told me

1:21:28.472 --> 1:21:30.340
of that terrible
group of bullies,

1:21:30.775 --> 1:21:34.645
and then I saw them drawing you,
my sweet Tabitha,

1:21:34.679 --> 1:21:38.148
into their caustic little
clique of attention seekers,

1:21:38.181 --> 1:21:40.752
we've been working
side by side together.

1:21:42.386 --> 1:21:47.057
I know that we are destined
to right many wrongs together.

1:21:48.458 --> 1:21:50.294
I promised you
it would work out.

1:21:51.261 --> 1:21:54.298
And here we are, together.

1:21:57.134 --> 1:21:58.836
And we've only just begun.

1:22:09.212 --> 1:22:13.785
Hey, guys, it's Julie.
I just wanted to say thank you

1:22:13.818 --> 1:22:15.753
for the love I've been getting.

1:22:15.787 --> 1:22:19.757
All the support and stuff.
It's overwhelming to think that

1:22:19.791 --> 1:22:23.493
so many people I've never met
care so much.

1:22:24.461 --> 1:22:27.799
It's beautiful.
It's social media at its best.

1:22:30.167 --> 1:22:33.303
But just remember,
there's another side.

1:22:34.538 --> 1:22:35.639
A darker side.

1:22:36.808 --> 1:22:38.108
I've seen it.

1:22:39.142 --> 1:22:43.180
It can kind of just
take over your world until

1:22:43.213 --> 1:22:46.149
you don't recognize the person
in your own selfies.

1:22:48.251 --> 1:22:51.254
So... I'm out.

1:22:52.356 --> 1:22:57.227
Okay? If you need to contact me,
just email me.

1:22:58.328 --> 1:23:00.832
And I'm not saying that you,
or anyone,

1:23:00.865 --> 1:23:02.566
should get off InstaTalk.

1:23:02.599 --> 1:23:05.535
Just don't give too much
of yourself away to it.

1:23:05.569 --> 1:23:06.838
Okay?

1:23:06.871 --> 1:23:10.641
Because everybody's watching.

1:23:11.274 --> 1:23:13.711
Your friends,
who really miss you,

1:23:13.745 --> 1:23:16.279
corporations
trying to sell you shit.

1:23:16.313 --> 1:23:19.316
Organizations trying to poison
your thoughts.

1:23:19.349 --> 1:23:23.821
And people who aren't
who they say they are.

1:23:25.355 --> 1:23:28.258
So just be careful, okay?

1:23:29.359 --> 1:23:33.665
Yeah, so. Bye.

1:23:38.903 --> 1:23:40.537
You ready?

1:23:40.570 --> 1:23:41.773
Give me a moment.

1:23:49.714 --> 1:23:52.249
- I am now.
- Good. What do you want to do?

1:23:52.717 --> 1:23:55.218
- Everything.
- Then let's do that.
