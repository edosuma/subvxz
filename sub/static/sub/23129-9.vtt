00:02.430 --> 00:03.761
- Previously on Being Human:

00:03.800 --> 00:05.325
The house! The '70s!

00:05.370 --> 00:07.099
- (Donna):
You were time travelling?

00:07.140 --> 00:08.369
When you use our magic,

00:08.400 --> 00:09.606
you run the risk

00:09.640 --> 00:12.507
of being trapped
in the past forever.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.737
- I'm stuck here!
I'm never going homel!

00:15.780 --> 00:18.374
I don't have to listen
to you ever again!

00:18.410 --> 00:20.071
(Both laughing)

00:20.120 --> 00:21.770
- Where did
you come from?

00:21.820 --> 00:25.381
- Josh, we can stop this
now! We can stop this!

00:25.420 --> 00:28.185
- (Aidan): What are you doing?
- Hey! Stop it!

00:28.220 --> 00:30.325
(Gasps)

00:30.360 --> 00:33.398
- Oh, baby, don't
do this to me, please!

00:33.430 --> 00:35.296
(Crying):
Please don't go!

00:42.370 --> 00:44.407
(Crying)

00:44.440 --> 00:45.669
(Siren wailing)

00:45.710 --> 00:48.805
- Guess I was meant to die
with my head bashed in.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.400
(Crying)

00:51.450 --> 00:53.669
- Sally...

00:53.720 --> 00:55.245
- It's OK, you can let me go.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.248
(Car horns honking in distance)

00:57.290 --> 00:58.519
- I can't!

01:00.690 --> 01:02.522
- Aidan, it's not me anymore!

01:02.560 --> 01:05.325
(Crying)

01:07.300 --> 01:09.792
(Cwing and
whimpering)

01:30.350 --> 01:31.511
- Are you gonna...

01:31.550 --> 01:33.314
(Sighing)

01:33.360 --> 01:35.613
...go through
your door now?

01:38.160 --> 01:40.151
- I don't get a door.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.696
- (Sobbing): Baby...

01:47.900 --> 01:50.335
What were you doing here?
Why were you here?

01:50.370 --> 01:52.737
- I just thought I could
stop you from drinking.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.849
I just wanna
hold you!

01:59.780 --> 02:01.669
I'm gonna miss
that the most.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.485
(Siren wailing)

02:04.520 --> 02:07.558
- Oh no! They made the call.

02:07.590 --> 02:10.479
You're not gonna wanna see what
happens next. Just, please...

02:10.530 --> 02:12.350
- No, I wanna see--
- Go!

02:18.530 --> 02:21.591
- (Officer):
Yeah, I got it. Stay back.

02:24.340 --> 02:28.504
Ah, look at this!
This is quite a picture.

02:28.540 --> 02:31.601
(Laughing):
It's very West Side Story.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.243
Quite the
homecoming, Aidan.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.475
- I'm not back, Bishop!

02:34.520 --> 02:36.739
- No, you're just
blood-drunk and high

02:36.790 --> 02:39.213
with a dead wolf
splayed at your feet.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.659
I'm not animal control.

02:40.690 --> 02:42.784
- She is not an animal!
You listen to me.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.787
You're going to do this,

02:44.830 --> 02:46.628
and you'll do it
for me as a favour!

02:46.660 --> 02:48.754
- That's what I'm gonna do?
- Yes, you are!

02:48.800 --> 02:51.360
- You haven't talked to
me in, what, a year? More?

02:51.400 --> 02:54.199
What, now you need me? Now
I'm your foul-weather friend?

02:54.240 --> 02:57.210
Like the chick you like to bang
and never take to the prom?

02:57.240 --> 03:00.369
- Oh, I've cleaned up
far worse messes for you!

03:08.380 --> 03:10.781
- Who killed your
girlfriend, Aidan?

03:13.390 --> 03:14.915
- Wolves...

03:14.960 --> 03:16.519
(Sniffling)

03:16.560 --> 03:18.426
Wolves...

03:18.460 --> 03:21.293
- You know the friends
you can call at 2:00 a.m.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.492
who roll out of bed,
no questions asked?

03:23.530 --> 03:25.294
They're golden.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.636
I'll take care of it.
We'll make this right, OK?

03:35.680 --> 03:37.239
- OK!

03:37.280 --> 03:39.248
- We gotta figure
out where to go.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.715
Boston's burned.
Too many vamps know us!

03:41.750 --> 03:43.639
- I have to go back!
I have to go back.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.943
I just left Aidan there.
Like, I just ran away!

03:45.990 --> 03:48.709
- Your best buddy didn't
lift a finger to stop it.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.252
He was drunk off his ass
draining live girls.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.997
You saw the blood
coming out of him.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.828
How many do you
think they killed?

03:54.860 --> 03:57.261
- You're the only one
that's killed tonight!

03:57.300 --> 04:00.463
- So far... Let's not put
a cap on the evening.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.007
- We can take him, Josh.
For once, it's a fair fight!

04:05.040 --> 04:06.530
- Ray, shut up! Enough!

04:06.580 --> 04:09.470
- I love a stray with
personality, Aidan.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.376
(Bishop):
I got dibs on this one.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.019
- Aidan... Aidan,
don't do this!

04:15.050 --> 04:17.747
Don't do this.
Josh is your friend.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.553
- ...and they
murdered you!

04:19.589 --> 04:22.685
- He has been with you
way longer than I have!

04:22.730 --> 04:24.482
Do not go back
to the way he is!

04:24.530 --> 04:26.498
If you do that,
what we have is over.

04:26.530 --> 04:30.489
- Aidan, it was over when they
opened her head on the pavement.

04:30.530 --> 04:33.966
- Aidan, listen to me. It was
an accident. It was a mistake!

04:34.000 --> 04:36.731
It was never meant
to be like this!

04:36.770 --> 04:40.479
Please, please understand!

04:42.810 --> 04:44.369
(Grunting)

04:44.410 --> 04:46.640
- Aidan, no, stop!
Please stop!

04:46.680 --> 04:48.011
(Screaming
and groaning)

04:48.050 --> 04:50.712
(Grunting)

04:50.750 --> 04:52.559
(Screaming)

04:58.430 --> 04:59.955
- (Josh): No!

05:02.030 --> 05:03.327
No! No!

05:03.370 --> 05:05.361
(Aidan grunting,
Ray groaning)

05:06.900 --> 05:08.493
(Josh panting)

05:10.940 --> 05:13.034
(Panting and screaming)

05:14.840 --> 05:16.808
- You're a monster.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.375
- Get outta here!

05:20.450 --> 05:23.420
- You know, when I first
met you, I made a mistake.

05:23.450 --> 05:26.556
I really think I should've
let Marcus finish you off.

05:26.590 --> 05:29.389
- Stop it!
- Shut up for a second!

05:29.430 --> 05:33.856
If I ever see you again,
I'm going to kill you.

05:39.470 --> 05:41.564
- W-W-What, that's
what you call justice?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.432
- No!
- Avenging the one you love?

05:43.470 --> 05:45.768
- You don't understand!
You don't know him.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.938
You don't know how much
he hates himself.

05:47.980 --> 05:51.701
Killing him, that would be
mercy. Ain't that right? Huh?

05:51.750 --> 05:54.549
(Crying): "We lost Nora!
Oh! We lost Nora!"

05:54.580 --> 05:56.844
The one woman that you
were meant to be with,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.119
and you couldn't land it.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.914
Why? Because of what you are.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.725
(Laughing)

06:02.760 --> 06:06.594
Oh, you know what else? Look!

06:06.630 --> 06:10.521
I took your one chance to cure
yourself, to lift the curse.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.596
Well, you know what,
you have a nice life, OK?

06:13.640 --> 06:18.134
- Hey, this whole
thing was your idea.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.605
Living together,

06:20.640 --> 06:24.406
trying to be human
was your idea!

06:24.450 --> 06:26.748
- OK, you don't wanna
do it, I will.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.748
- Hey! Let him suffer.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.714
(Clicking tongue)

06:30.750 --> 06:34.584
(Aidan laughing)

06:40.200 --> 06:42.623
(Sobbing)

06:44.930 --> 06:47.570
- The eye thing
was a perfect touch.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.500
So you got to
see the world.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.737
You got to indulge in a totally
alternative lifestyle, right?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.578
But there's no
place like home.

06:54.610 --> 06:56.009
- I need a drink.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.739
- Of course, you do.
Drinks for my favourite son!

07:22.670 --> 07:25.207
(* Rock on earphones )

07:25.240 --> 07:30.041
(* Man singing,
lyrics indistinct *)

07:36.850 --> 07:39.046
Who's the punctual employee?

07:40.220 --> 07:41.654
Who? Who raised you?

07:41.690 --> 07:44.819
Oh, how is our little friend?

07:44.860 --> 07:45.952
- Oh!

07:47.530 --> 07:49.965
- Mmm, yeah!
Healthy as a horse!

07:50.000 --> 07:52.560
- But getting a little
bit harder to come by

07:52.600 --> 07:54.090
if I'm being honest.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.064
- Well, we're just gonna
have to raise the price

07:57.110 --> 07:59.033
of healthy blood
just a skosh.

07:59.070 --> 08:01.107
- (Aidan):
Oh, I see!

08:01.140 --> 08:04.849
So, the customer appreciates
quality disease-free products.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.814
You know what
that reminds me of:

08:06.850 --> 08:09.171
prohibition, slowly
jack up the prices.

08:09.220 --> 08:12.087
- This is food, man!
You can go without whiskey.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.713
You cannot go
without your bread.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.558
- You know what
occurred to me?

08:15.590 --> 08:19.128
This disease, this virus
is what makes us kings.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.993
- That is pure propheteering.
Where is your conscience?

08:22.030 --> 08:23.725
- I think I left it inside.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.260
- Yeah, go get it!

08:25.300 --> 08:28.838
- All right. This famine is
making you unbearably popular.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.705
(Chimes tinkling)

08:40.919 --> 08:42.945
(Men and women laughing)

08:42.990 --> 08:44.981
<i>- Pie!</i>

08:45.020 --> 08:47.580
- (Laughing): Oh, wow,
is that really one slice?

08:47.620 --> 08:48.815
- It's a big piece, yeah!

08:48.860 --> 08:50.624
That's why I call
it "die happy."

08:50.660 --> 08:53.630
- Bold to bring up death while
people are eating your pie.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.890
You've got a sick,
yet poetic sense of humour.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.261
- (Josh): Well!
- Oh my God!

08:57.300 --> 09:00.292
You have to ask her out!
She thinks "bleak" is a plus!

09:00.340 --> 09:02.968
- So, you're all good?
I gotta check on the ovens.

09:03.010 --> 09:07.880
- Oh, yeah! That should
do me for, like, a month.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.644
- Oh my God, Josh!

09:10.680 --> 09:12.648
Why did you kick
that girl in the teeth?

09:12.680 --> 09:15.172
She was begging for it.
Why didn't you ask her out?

09:15.220 --> 09:17.040
You haven't dated
in, like, a year.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.855
- Because I'm a werewolf!
No girl wants that.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.710
- If I could just...

09:21.760 --> 09:23.250
If I can get to Ilana...

09:23.290 --> 09:26.726
- Oh my God! I'm not gonna track
down some storefront psychic

09:26.760 --> 09:28.854
so that she can sling
you into the future!

09:28.900 --> 09:30.163
No one can do that!

09:30.200 --> 09:32.294
- Well, if I could just
speak with Donna,

09:32.330 --> 09:34.037
maybe she could sling me

09:34.070 --> 09:36.607
into wherever the hell
I'm supposed to be right now.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.200
If I could just get to
where I'm meant to be,

09:39.240 --> 09:40.935
we can still all be together.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.176
You, me, Aidan, Nora--
- Stop!

09:43.210 --> 09:44.371
Listen to me.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.947
I've managed to cobble
together a tiny existence

09:46.980 --> 09:49.074
of maybe not happiness,
but OK-ness,

09:49.120 --> 09:52.340
and you keep trying to pry it
out of my hands and blow it up!

09:52.390 --> 09:54.210
- I'm not try--
- Stop, stop!

09:54.260 --> 09:58.288
Your interventions don't help!

09:58.330 --> 10:01.197
(Door bells chiming)

10:09.740 --> 10:13.370
Whatever charmed life
in a brownstone

10:13.410 --> 10:16.675
you think we had is over.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.995
(Exhaling sharply)

10:42.040 --> 10:44.668
- You scared the
crap out of me.

10:44.710 --> 10:48.010
- It's not nice
to be spied on, is it?

10:52.310 --> 10:56.417
- What other impossible
request can I grant for you?

10:56.450 --> 10:58.714
- Nora, we have
a very simple agreement.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.412
We turn a blind eye to
what each other is doing.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.020
And you didn't
exactly turn away.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.024
- You're taking
way too much blood.

11:09.060 --> 11:12.690
There are fewer patients who
haven't been exposed to the flu.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.368
And that woman that you drew
from? You almost killed her!

11:15.400 --> 11:18.438
- How's your back, Nora?

11:18.470 --> 11:22.031
It's been, what, like,
5, 6 months since the surgery?

11:22.080 --> 11:24.139
Head nurse strung
out on pain pills.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.443
It's not exactly
protocol, is it?

11:28.480 --> 11:31.188
You really ought to take
better care of yourself.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.881
I know Lynette worries.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.879
- Don't talk
about my mother!

11:37.960 --> 11:39.792
- Oops!

11:44.200 --> 11:46.464
- One of the nurses
found our blood.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.332
She put it in the bank.

11:48.370 --> 11:51.203
She thought someone
had misplaced the bags.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.130
- Well, dammit, you
better get it back!

11:54.180 --> 11:56.945
- It's mixed in
with the general pool.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.448
- I don't think
you understand

11:58.480 --> 12:00.312
how much I need
that blood, Nora.

12:00.350 --> 12:03.445
- I'm screening new donors
as fast as I can.

12:05.490 --> 12:08.084
If you didn't have
to deliver to Bishop,

12:08.120 --> 12:09.952
we both could be a lot safer.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.185
(Grunting)

12:13.000 --> 12:15.219
- Never threaten Bishop.

12:15.260 --> 12:18.321
(Panting)

12:26.370 --> 12:27.929
(Crying)

12:27.980 --> 12:29.334
- Oh my God!

12:42.520 --> 12:45.251
You can put them in
the container over there.

12:45.290 --> 12:48.328
We recycle. That's right,
we do it right. Hey!

12:48.360 --> 12:51.193
- If there's ever anything
I can do down at the courthouse.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.938
Seriously, we'd all
be dust without you.

12:53.970 --> 12:55.369
- You got it, brother!
Thank you!

12:55.400 --> 12:56.936
This is what
I love to see.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.529
The city coming
together like this.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.504
- What's up, Daddio?
- Hey! Refills!

13:00.540 --> 13:03.475
- (Aidan): Wow, hell of
a turnout. You got a minute?

13:03.510 --> 13:06.343
- Yeah! Yeah, sure! Marcus!

13:13.520 --> 13:15.818
- You think you
got enough in there?

13:15.860 --> 13:17.259
- You lived through the '50s.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.952
A 3-month supply of food
in case a bomb drops...

13:20.000 --> 13:21.957
- I remember it
very, very well,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.229
- ...a bizarre apocalypse.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.364
- I got ice chests
in the basement,

13:25.400 --> 13:26.561
so don't worry about it.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.489
- What the heck's
a matter with you?

13:28.540 --> 13:31.009
You skip your brekkie
again today? Here!

13:31.040 --> 13:33.031
- Um, I'm just
gonna say this.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.004
I'm coming up a bit
short on this delivery.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.246
- Hmm!

13:39.010 --> 13:41.012
- There was a mix-up
at the hospital,

13:41.050 --> 13:42.415
but it's been
taken care of.

13:42.450 --> 13:43.849
- Hmm!

13:43.890 --> 13:46.245
Everybody else seems
to be pulling their weight.

13:46.290 --> 13:49.112
And they don't have
an endless supply of humans!

13:49.160 --> 13:51.049
- Marcus locks girls up--

13:51.090 --> 13:54.321
- Marcus doesn't complain
about what he can't do!

13:54.360 --> 13:56.328
- OK, James, it's me, OK?

13:56.360 --> 13:59.330
So, what if we just borrow
a little bit from the bank,

13:59.370 --> 14:01.259
just a couple of days,

14:01.300 --> 14:04.304
and I will have
the blood to replace it.

14:04.340 --> 14:07.878
- If I had heard that,
which I didn't,

14:07.910 --> 14:09.036
I'd have to replace you

14:09.080 --> 14:11.276
with someone who can
keep the trains running!

14:11.310 --> 14:12.607
- Don't threaten me!

14:12.650 --> 14:15.278
We got a good thing
at that hospital. We know it!

14:15.320 --> 14:18.039
- No. 2 always works
harder than No. 1.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.286
- I'm sorry I even asked!
- Shut up!

14:21.920 --> 14:23.024
Get outta here!

14:31.370 --> 14:34.931
- A little sweeper, huh?
Sweepy little guy.

14:34.970 --> 14:38.167
Every job you have,
just keeping everything tidy!

14:38.210 --> 14:39.234
(Door bells chiming)

14:39.270 --> 14:41.375
- Hello?

14:41.410 --> 14:44.175
- Ilana! Hi, um, I'm Josh.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.348
- Hey!

14:45.380 --> 14:47.576
- Uh, would you
care for some pie?

14:47.620 --> 14:50.043
- Eee! Diabetic.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.489
- Oh!

14:53.960 --> 14:55.610
- Oh...

14:57.090 --> 14:59.058
I can see why you called me.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.990
- You can?
- Yeah.

15:01.030 --> 15:05.194
There's a very palpable,
insistent spirit here.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.096
- Yeah, super insistent.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.939
Except, like I said,
she doesn't wanna be here.

15:09.970 --> 15:12.610
She just wants to go
back where she belongs.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.972
- Why don't you tell
me what you know,

15:15.010 --> 15:16.978
and I'll see if
I can exorcise her.

15:17.010 --> 15:20.947
- Oh, no, no! There's not gonna
be any exorcising necessary.

15:20.980 --> 15:24.689
No, I just need to find an
acquaintance of yours. Donna?

15:24.720 --> 15:26.950
(Sighing)

15:26.990 --> 15:29.379
- Can't help you there!
- I don't know where she is.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.286
She's not at
the soup kitchen.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.253
I'll pay! I'll pay
for the exorcism.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.998
- No! You mislead me
and you wasted my time.

15:37.030 --> 15:39.522
- Ilana, please, there
are lives at stake.

15:39.570 --> 15:41.629
Donna's the only
one who can help.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.633
Please!

15:53.280 --> 15:55.271
What's that?

15:56.480 --> 15:59.541
- This is to help
us find Donna

15:59.590 --> 16:02.389
and to protect us from her.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.526
OK, give me your hands.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.190
(Grunting)

16:18.310 --> 16:19.664
- Can I help you?

16:19.710 --> 16:21.303
- Look at me.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.299
Yup, your eyes
are clearer.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.273
OK, just hear me out.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.709
You have been under
ghost possession.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.412
I dragged you through salt,
which ghosts cannot cross.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.758
- What?

16:33.790 --> 16:36.760
You, you possessed me?

16:36.790 --> 16:39.282
Are you serious?
- You can see her?

16:39.330 --> 16:41.753
- I did it for us, so we
could be where we belong.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.690
- No, I said "no, no, no"
every time you asked!

16:44.730 --> 16:46.528
You raped my will!

16:47.600 --> 16:49.068
Oh God, yes, it's Sally.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.159
She's a ghost.
She's right there.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.439
- Yeah, I don't know

16:52.470 --> 16:55.030
what kind of crazy,
codependent partnership you--

16:55.080 --> 16:57.469
- No, it's not codependent!
- Come on, we need her!

16:57.510 --> 16:58.705
- I don't touch
that stuff!

16:58.750 --> 17:00.240
- I don't blame you at all!

17:00.280 --> 17:01.577
(Door bells chiming)

17:01.620 --> 17:04.714
Unbelievable!

17:04.750 --> 17:07.151
(Man talking, indistinct)

17:09.560 --> 17:11.483
- (Man): Yeah, hello!
- Freeze up!

17:13.500 --> 17:17.221
(* Gebbie Street
by DZ Deathrays *)

17:17.270 --> 17:22.731
** You know our bodies
make the right conversation *

17:22.770 --> 17:25.660
What do you need, sweetheart?
- Hey, where's Bishop?

17:25.710 --> 17:28.077
Are you in charge
of the blood now?

17:28.109 --> 17:30.078
You, like, have
your own supply?

17:30.110 --> 17:33.546
* I could see colour up,
but I ain't blind *

17:33.580 --> 17:37.084
* Love to be centre up with
you on sun ray's shine *

17:37.120 --> 17:39.088
* You ran away *

17:39.120 --> 17:42.215
* Still waiting for
the best time of your life *

17:42.260 --> 17:46.083
* Burn slow, breaking up, this
fire's back in your house *

17:46.130 --> 17:49.100
- I always have
my own supply.

17:49.130 --> 17:51.189
- Sorry,
I didn't know.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.061
Thanks, Mr. Waite.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.502
- Remember who
your friends are.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.372
<i>* I want to jump in *</i>

18:02.410 --> 18:04.504
* I don't want to jump in *¥*

18:04.550 --> 18:08.339
- No... NO!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.755
I completely understand,

18:19.790 --> 18:23.397
and I take full
responsibility.

18:23.430 --> 18:24.659
But on the bright side,

18:24.700 --> 18:27.237
you got your money,
the trains run on time--

18:27.270 --> 18:28.294
- Aidan, shut up!

18:31.440 --> 18:33.431
- I'm gonna
replace your stash.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.405
By tomorrow, I will have all of
the blood, plus a little extra.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.906
- Nobody else was
slow this week.

18:38.950 --> 18:42.511
- Marcus, no one's talking to
you! Wipe that grin off!

18:42.550 --> 18:45.815
You look like the kid about
to eat everyone at Christmas.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.352
Wipe it off!

18:47.390 --> 18:49.654
OK, so let me get this straight.

18:49.690 --> 18:53.456
You were giving away blood
at your place for me...

18:53.500 --> 18:56.253
- Well, I didn't
exactly give it--

18:56.300 --> 18:58.166
(Aidan grunting)

18:59.400 --> 19:00.799
- ...So the huddled masses

19:00.840 --> 19:03.229
would know who to thank?

19:03.270 --> 19:06.365
(Aidan groaning,
Bishop grunting)

19:06.410 --> 19:07.935
Thank you, Aidan!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.505
(Groaning)

19:09.540 --> 19:11.406
You're so considerate!

19:12.610 --> 19:13.941
You know what
your problem is?

19:13.980 --> 19:15.618
You're having
growing pains.

19:15.650 --> 19:17.448
And that's OK.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.755
We'll get through
this together! Together!

19:22.560 --> 19:24.187
Just the two of us.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.425
(Both grunting)

19:28.260 --> 19:30.763
(Groaning)

19:32.270 --> 19:34.591
You know what I love
about the old country,

19:34.640 --> 19:37.530
the punishments
always fit the crime.

19:37.570 --> 19:41.700
(Bishop grunting,
Aidan groaning)

19:41.740 --> 19:44.846
And you know what the
punishment was for stealing?

19:44.880 --> 19:47.770
(Panting, whimpering)

19:52.390 --> 19:54.882
(Laughing)

19:54.920 --> 19:57.355
I would never do that to you.

19:57.390 --> 19:58.824
You're my best boy!

19:58.860 --> 20:00.555
(Laughing)

20:00.600 --> 20:03.467
Sometimes, you need a little
theatre to make your point.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.797
- I'd pay to
see that show.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.731
- (Laughing):
Wallace!

20:07.770 --> 20:11.365
(Bishop grunting,
Wallace groaning)

20:11.410 --> 20:12.639
(Screaming)

20:12.670 --> 20:14.502
This degenerate,
on the other hand,

20:14.540 --> 20:16.679
has been skimming
off the top, haven't you?

20:16.710 --> 20:19.304
- What? I make my quota!
- Seriously? Look at us!

20:19.350 --> 20:23.014
We are rationing ounces,
and you are practically glowing.

20:23.050 --> 20:25.485
You look like you're
swimming in it!

20:25.520 --> 20:27.318
I can smell the fresh on you.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.783
- I give you everything
I get, I swear!

20:29.820 --> 20:31.754
- It's still my turn.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.622
You know what I'm gonna do?

20:33.660 --> 20:36.994
I'm gonna teach you a
little lesson in gluttony.

20:37.030 --> 20:38.566
- No, Bishop!

20:49.440 --> 20:50.839
(Screaming)

20:50.880 --> 20:52.769
(Horns honking)

20:54.020 --> 20:56.318
- Are you really
still mad at me?

20:56.350 --> 20:57.988
It's been 24 hours!

20:59.720 --> 21:02.382
Come on, would you
just yell at me, at least?

21:02.420 --> 21:06.323
Because the silent treatment
is driving me bat-crunk.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.294
You're the only person
I have to talk to.

21:08.330 --> 21:10.526
- Yeah, I know.
You're my only friend.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.335
And you completely
betrayed my trust, Sally.

21:13.370 --> 21:14.769
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

21:14.800 --> 21:17.440
- No, I mean, I--I just
can't trust you anymore.

21:17.470 --> 21:20.531
- Are you happy right now?
Answer me! Are you happy?

21:20.580 --> 21:22.730
Because in the other
life, it was better!

21:22.780 --> 21:25.579
- You know what? Pie
makes things better. You?

21:25.610 --> 21:27.942
- Don't iron me.
- I'm tempted.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.853
- Josh, stop adding up
maple syrup in your head.

21:33.890 --> 21:36.359
I have a job now.
- I'm not! I know!

21:36.390 --> 21:37.824
- I'm kicking
in for groceries.

21:41.630 --> 21:43.621
- Did you just possess me again?

21:43.670 --> 21:46.560
- No! You just had some weird,
like, non-shaking seizure.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.898
The left side of
your face is moving.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.637
<i>- 1-- I had a memory.</i>

21:51.670 --> 21:55.573
It was us, the three of us in
the kitchen: you, me and Nora.

21:55.610 --> 21:57.476
But that never happened.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.445
- OK, yeah, um...

22:01.480 --> 22:04.586
It's one of the side effects
of me possessing you.

22:04.620 --> 22:05.985
I leave memories behind.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.717
- Oh, great! Great!

22:08.760 --> 22:12.128
So now I have little bits
of your head in my brain.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.855
Is that--Is that right?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.528
So how long does
that stick around?

22:16.560 --> 22:18.995
- I don't--
- Oh, forever? Forever, then?

22:19.030 --> 22:19.997
- I'm not sure!

22:20.030 --> 22:21.464
- It's not bad enough

22:21.500 --> 22:23.901
I have my own
tortured memories of Nora.

22:23.940 --> 22:25.567
Now, I have yours too!

22:25.610 --> 22:26.736
(Door bells chiming)

22:26.770 --> 22:28.636
Ma'am, we're closed.
I'm sorry.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.000
I thought I locked the door!

22:30.040 --> 22:32.543
- Josh! JOSH!

22:32.580 --> 22:36.346
- Sorry about that!
Huge bug back there.

22:38.620 --> 22:41.817
(Women hissing, Josh grunting)

22:44.930 --> 22:48.093
(Both grunting)

22:54.540 --> 22:56.565
(Both grunting)

22:58.010 --> 22:59.637
(Woman hissing, Josh screaming)

23:02.710 --> 23:04.508
(Josh grunting, woman groaning)

23:06.910 --> 23:09.743
- Oh my God! Thank
God! Are you OK?

23:09.780 --> 23:11.646
(Panting)

23:11.690 --> 23:14.785
- I just killed a vampire.
I'm nowhere near a full moon!

23:14.820 --> 23:16.549
Did you see that?
- Settle down!

23:16.590 --> 23:18.979
She was on her deathbed
and a teenager.

23:19.030 --> 23:20.850
You didn't even see it, Sally!

23:20.900 --> 23:23.460
- I saw it and I wish
you hadn't ironed me,

23:23.500 --> 23:25.992
because I was trying to
tell you she had the virus.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.930
- What are you talking about?

23:27.970 --> 23:29.836
- Oh my God! Aidan!

23:30.940 --> 23:33.477
(Crickets chirping)

23:35.640 --> 23:39.747
(Car horns honking,
men shouting in distance)

23:39.780 --> 23:42.750
Glad to see your face
isn't falling off.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.112
- That's a hell of
a thing to joke about.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.017
- Nice jacket.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.118
- What do you want?

23:49.160 --> 23:50.821
- I just need
to talk to you.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.521
Could we go in?

23:52.560 --> 23:55.427
- I thought I was a monster.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.091
- Let's go inside.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.763
- Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!
Hold on for a second.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.801
What is this about?

24:06.840 --> 24:08.103
(Sighing)

24:08.140 --> 24:09.232
(Sighing)

24:09.280 --> 24:11.009
- It's about you.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.020
- It's about me?
What does that mean?

24:14.050 --> 24:16.439
- Well, both of
you, actually.

24:19.820 --> 24:22.585
- What the hell is this?
You know something?

24:22.620 --> 24:24.258
I seem to recall I told you

24:24.290 --> 24:26.657
that the next time I
saw you, I'd kill you,

24:26.690 --> 24:28.727
<i>so what's to stop me
from killing you--</i>

24:28.760 --> 24:30.728
- You wanna rumble?
By the recycling bins?

24:30.770 --> 24:33.193
I got a pretty big stick.
- But mine's bigger.

24:33.230 --> 24:38.031
- Boys, boys! Penises down.
You need Josh, you psycho.

24:38.070 --> 24:39.902
You need his blood.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.533
(Scoffs)

24:52.950 --> 24:54.509
Mr. Butin, dial the operator.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.779
(Women chattering)

25:01.160 --> 25:03.925
- (Woman): All right.
You're gonna be OK.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.825
- Nora?

25:09.570 --> 25:11.834
Hi, I just saw you,
and I thought--

25:11.870 --> 25:13.099
I wanted to say hi.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.871
- Didn't you move
away from Boston?

25:15.910 --> 25:19.676
- Yeah, I did. I did.
I'm just here, uh...

25:19.710 --> 25:21.542
I'm here visiting Aidan.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.613
Who, apparently,
you're not a fan of.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.813
- How can you be friends
with someone like that?

25:29.860 --> 25:32.079
You know what he is?

25:32.130 --> 25:34.952
Are you one too?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.820
- No. No, no, no, no. I--

25:38.130 --> 25:39.825
I'm--I'm sorry.

25:39.870 --> 25:42.168
I didn't mean to upset you. I--

25:44.770 --> 25:48.570
How's Dr. Reed?

25:50.880 --> 25:53.770
- Divorce goes through
next month.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.039
- I'm sorry to hear that.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.117
- Turns out marrying
a serial cheater

25:58.150 --> 26:00.141
isn't the way to
happily ever after.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.987
- 'Cause you are
just so, so awesome.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.589
(Laughing)

26:06.630 --> 26:08.189
- I kissed him too soon.

26:08.230 --> 26:09.197
(Laughing)

26:09.230 --> 26:11.198
And I didn't
write any vows.

26:11.230 --> 26:12.595
- That's all right.

26:12.630 --> 26:13.859
- Oh God, I love you!

26:13.900 --> 26:15.231
- That'll do.

26:21.310 --> 26:24.143
Sorry, I just
blanked out for a second.

26:24.180 --> 26:29.072
You ever have those, uh,
intense pangs of dj-vu?

26:30.950 --> 26:32.839
- Yeah.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.688
Anyway, I should get back.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.755
- Yeah, yeah.

26:43.930 --> 26:45.762
Nora...

26:48.370 --> 26:49.769
Take care
of yourself,

26:49.800 --> 26:51.268
no matter what...

26:53.270 --> 26:56.308
"cause you are
SO, SO awesome.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.986
- Glad you straightened out
your supply chain.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.223
- I told you I would.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.797
- I knew you were
good for it.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.195
(Chuckling)

27:20.230 --> 27:23.268
- Well, then I suppose
I ought to be thankful

27:23.300 --> 27:26.338
that you didn't carve
my fangs out of my head.

27:26.370 --> 27:27.735
(Chuckling)

27:28.980 --> 27:30.209
- I'll tell you what:

27:30.240 --> 27:33.210
Let's just put aside
this Shakespearean crap

27:33.250 --> 27:34.979
once and for all, shall we?

27:35.020 --> 27:36.374
- Well, do we
have a choice?

27:36.420 --> 27:38.286
You can't pick
who your family is.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.310
Well, you can.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.051
(Siren wailing in distance)

27:45.730 --> 27:46.822
- Guest first.

27:46.860 --> 27:47.952
- Really?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.719
You think I'm gonna
drag an entire case

27:50.770 --> 27:52.761
of tainted blood
into your--

27:52.800 --> 27:53.961
- Apparently.

27:55.270 --> 27:59.400
- Mmm, hot damn!
That's fresh!

27:59.440 --> 28:02.000
Still feel kind of
a quiver in it.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.410
- Salut.

28:14.420 --> 28:16.115
More!

28:16.160 --> 28:18.128
- Here, have another.
- Ah, OK.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.254
- Double fist it.
Have you dated a werewolf?

28:20.290 --> 28:23.123
That ever happen to you?
Can we get some more of this?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.366
What's that mean?

28:26.170 --> 28:27.899
(Both laughing)

28:27.940 --> 28:30.136
...wiped her ass 'cause
she took a shit, but...

28:30.170 --> 28:32.332
(Both laughing)

28:43.990 --> 28:45.242
- Hey.

28:47.050 --> 28:48.814
How are you feeling?

28:48.860 --> 28:50.851
- I'm all right.

28:51.990 --> 28:53.958
- Where have you been?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.020
- Just tying up
some loose ends.

28:57.060 --> 28:59.290
- Well, you don't have
to be so creepy about it.

28:59.330 --> 29:00.320
But good.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.162
- Thank you,
both of you.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.838
- You saved me once,
the night we met.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.770
What's a slug or two
of my blood, you know?

29:10.810 --> 29:12.005
Let's call it even.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.909
- YOou guys can go now.

29:15.950 --> 29:18.817
- Wait! I thought
you'd come with us.

29:18.850 --> 29:22.787
- I am about to get everything
that I have worked for.

29:22.820 --> 29:27.485
228 years, and I'm
finally free of Bishop.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.927
So, I guess that
makes me king of the hill.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.938
(Laughing)

29:41.410 --> 29:44.448
- Let's go, Sally, there's
no one here anymore.

29:46.310 --> 29:48.517
- This is who we
came back to save?

29:50.320 --> 29:52.812
You were better off dead.

30:10.070 --> 30:12.801
(Bishop vomiting)

30:23.950 --> 30:27.079
- Is there anything that
you need me to take care of?

30:27.120 --> 30:28.918
(Coughing)

30:31.490 --> 30:33.049
Bishop...

30:35.200 --> 30:37.419
you never once
turned your back on me.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.293
- Spare me the minuet of grief.

30:42.270 --> 30:44.068
You're here to gloat.

30:45.610 --> 30:48.932
Welcome to
your coronation.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.301
I do have
a question, though.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.375
How did you poison me...

30:54.550 --> 30:56.973
and not one
blemish on you?

30:57.020 --> 31:02.857
- It was a crazy fluke.
I think some of us are immune.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.250
(Laughing)

31:06.290 --> 31:09.225
Bishop, you've
got it wrong.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.399
(Bishop coughing)

31:11.430 --> 31:14.092
- I know you
killed me, Aidan.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.939
Half of Boston knows.

31:18.970 --> 31:22.235
You think Marcus is gonna
come busting through that door?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.271
Nobody, not even Marcus,

31:24.310 --> 31:29.373
is gonna stand up for a dying
king and piss on the new one.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.616
- Oh my God!

31:33.520 --> 31:35.010
Bishop...

31:36.660 --> 31:39.960
are you afraid of
what's on the other side?

31:39.990 --> 31:42.698
I don't know.
Maybe we got it wrong.

31:42.730 --> 31:45.290
Maybe there's something
waiting for us. Maybe--

31:46.300 --> 31:48.530
- I am the other side.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.303
When you died, I was waiting
for you on that battlefield.

31:56.010 --> 31:57.409
I was.

31:57.440 --> 32:01.513
I hope you're this lucky
when it's your turn.

32:01.550 --> 32:06.283
You don't get taken out
by some stray stake...

32:08.360 --> 32:11.660
but by someone who
fed from your blood,

32:11.690 --> 32:14.455
who you nourished
for centuries.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.549
A father never
kills his son...

32:19.430 --> 32:22.297
but always wants his
son to surpass him.

32:26.610 --> 32:31.047
- I'm sorry that I didn't
arrange it sooner then.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.272
- I knew you wanted
to take credit.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.244
(Sighing)

32:40.750 --> 32:43.412
You know, a year ago,

32:43.460 --> 32:47.283
you were laying with wolves
and blubbering about ghosts.

32:47.330 --> 32:48.627
And now, look at you.

32:49.730 --> 32:51.698
You've killed your maker.

32:53.330 --> 32:56.459
You've banished your
lover and your friends.

32:56.500 --> 33:00.164
And now, you're
going to be Adam.

33:00.210 --> 33:02.076
After this plague,

33:02.110 --> 33:05.546
rebuild our race
with your blood.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.117
My blood.

33:09.150 --> 33:12.711
I said you couldn't
stand where I stand.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.451
You can.

33:15.490 --> 33:17.015
You...

33:18.760 --> 33:22.719
are my perfect son.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.728
(Exhaling)

33:28.100 --> 33:31.502
(* We Are the
Wild Ones by Nina *)

33:37.510 --> 33:40.707
** Find what you love *

33:42.380 --> 33:46.487
* And let it kill you *

33:46.520 --> 33:50.616
* That place between
sleep and a dream *

33:52.160 --> 33:54.549
* Is where I'll wait for you *

33:54.600 --> 33:57.126
* Let's stretch
across the highways *

33:57.160 --> 34:00.130
(Aidan laughing)

34:00.170 --> 34:04.300
* Until our voices echo
through the dunes *

34:04.340 --> 34:08.402
* Life takes
no prisoners, babe *

34:08.440 --> 34:13.674
* We have to do
all our living soon *

34:13.710 --> 34:17.647
* We are the lost souls *

34:17.679 --> 34:23.187
* We might as well
drive unto the edge **

34:32.170 --> 34:34.389
- This is your life.

34:34.440 --> 34:38.206
Invisible security guard
to a middling pie shop.

34:44.880 --> 34:48.145
Did you come here to get
a booster dose already?

34:48.179 --> 34:51.150
You're gonna have to
roofie some wolf chick,

34:51.190 --> 34:52.817
'cause Josh is not
gonna put out again.

34:52.850 --> 34:54.181
- Sally, I...

34:54.219 --> 34:55.755
(Sighing)

34:55.790 --> 34:57.815
Listen, when you died,

34:57.860 --> 35:00.420
I was the reason
why you were there.

35:01.660 --> 35:03.697
I-- T couldn't look at you.

35:03.730 --> 35:05.892
I--I can't even
look at you now.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.796
I couldn't look at Josh.

35:08.870 --> 35:10.838
- Yeah, it really
got messed up.

35:10.870 --> 35:14.135
- That's what I'm talking
about. I messed it up. Me.

35:16.280 --> 35:20.899
We were happy, weren't we?

35:20.950 --> 35:26.116
- You're this power-crazed
tornado of self-destruction.

35:27.950 --> 35:30.817
- Well, at least
I got to be with you.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.324
(Gasping)

35:33.360 --> 35:34.498
- Sally?

35:34.530 --> 35:36.328
Sally, Sally,
what's happening?

35:36.360 --> 35:37.327
Oh my--

35:37.360 --> 35:38.862
What do I do?

35:38.900 --> 35:40.789
Tell me what to do!

35:40.830 --> 35:41.900
(Gasping)

35:41.940 --> 35:43.738
(Grunting)

35:43.770 --> 35:46.603
- Finally! I have been
trying to summon you for months!

35:46.640 --> 35:47.869
- Donna?

35:47.910 --> 35:50.231
- What the hell
kind of a thing are you?

35:50.280 --> 35:52.476
That's a sprite?
- I'm a ghost!

35:52.510 --> 35:54.478
We're friends, sort of.

35:54.520 --> 35:58.616
I'm from the future, and
I just need your help to return.

35:58.650 --> 35:59.640
So, here's the thing:

35:59.690 --> 36:00.816
In the other timeline,

36:00.850 --> 36:01.885
you ate my soul.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.479
Then, you kind of blew up,

36:03.520 --> 36:06.751
and we've been, like, spiritual
Siamese twins ever since.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.225
- So, that's what
that--that pulling!

36:09.260 --> 36:11.365
You have been
tapping into my juice!

36:11.400 --> 36:12.629
- Well, not intentionally.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.638
I just need to go
where I belong.

36:14.670 --> 36:15.796
Can you do that?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.763
- You want me to
send you to the future

36:17.800 --> 36:19.507
SO you can blow me up
and steal my--

36:19.540 --> 36:22.703
- No, that's not what happened!
I'm not doing that!

36:22.740 --> 36:25.243
Hey, what the hell?

36:25.280 --> 36:26.679
We're linked!

36:26.710 --> 36:29.247
Would you just listen to me?

36:31.290 --> 36:32.519
I saw you in Andover.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.279
I saw you hanging.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.311
It was never your
choice to eat souls

36:36.360 --> 36:38.658
or be the Wicked Witch
of the East.

36:38.690 --> 36:41.660
- I'm not into pop-psychology!

36:41.700 --> 36:44.260
Especially from
an unhinged parasite!

36:44.300 --> 36:46.268
- All right,
what about this, then?

36:46.300 --> 36:47.859
In the future, you change.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.665
You don't do magic anymore.

36:50.700 --> 36:54.273
You ask me to
release you, and I do.

36:54.310 --> 36:55.675
- You.

36:55.710 --> 36:59.704
- You actually turn out to be
kind of a badass, cool lady,

36:59.750 --> 37:01.616
surprisingly.

37:06.790 --> 37:09.418
- You can't trust a witch!
Black magic inevitably--

37:09.460 --> 37:11.554
- It's not black magic,
for God's sake!

37:11.590 --> 37:12.955
- But does it
involve Satan?

37:12.990 --> 37:14.697
'Cause I'm not
down with that.

37:14.730 --> 37:16.698
- Guys, look.
Donna and I

37:16.730 --> 37:18.596
have an intense
history together.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.962
Like, "a been to
hell and back" history.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.970
Now, she can reset our lives
to how they're supposed to be,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.707
but we each have to agree.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.038
- I mean, vampire,
werewolf, ghost...

37:28.070 --> 37:29.731
I'd reroll the dice
if I were you.

37:29.780 --> 37:30.770
(Laughing)

37:30.810 --> 37:32.448
Aidan, look,
like, your life

37:32.480 --> 37:35.370
is a terrible, rotten
cesspool, so there's that.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.047
But Josh, you have
the most to lose.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.879
As much as I make fun of you,
you have pie, regulars.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.912
- You know, that still sounds
like you're making fun of me.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.759
- You've built this
quiet little cocoon of a life

37:45.790 --> 37:47.986
into which a cute
crust enthusiast may wander,

37:48.030 --> 37:49.327
if you let her.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.295
- I just wanna know one thing.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.338
I marry Nora, right?

37:57.370 --> 37:59.008
- And she's not
a Vicodin addict?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.064
- No.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.737
Yes.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.804
- OxyContin?

38:02.840 --> 38:03.807
- No!

38:03.840 --> 38:04.841
- OK.

38:06.110 --> 38:07.908
- That's what I want.
I want that.

38:07.950 --> 38:09.941
I want the future
that I saw, with Nora.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.345
That's where I belong.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.347
- OK, none of this time

38:13.390 --> 38:15.654
before Sally got here
will have happened.

38:15.690 --> 38:18.011
Who you think you are,
you'll have no memory of.

38:18.060 --> 38:21.951
You are casting your lines
into an unknown sea.

38:35.710 --> 38:38.350
You may bounce around
in time a little bit first.

38:38.380 --> 38:41.008
It's not like punching
a reset button.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.870
It's like tying
a bungee cord to you

38:42.920 --> 38:44.684
and kind of hurling you out.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.746
You're gonna overshoot
before you stop.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.088
- Well, that doesn't
sound great.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.020
- What if the
tether snaps?

38:52.060 --> 38:53.425
- It's a metaphor.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.859
You'll settle at the right time.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.959
Look, I need her to
even more than you do.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.661
(Sighing)

39:03.470 --> 39:04.869
- I'll see you.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.901
- Oh no, are we
really gonna have

39:06.940 --> 39:09.739
some epic Casablanca goodbye?

39:09.780 --> 39:14.001
- So, um, if I forget...

39:15.420 --> 39:18.685
and I'm different,
make me remember.

39:22.660 --> 39:24.651
I love you.

39:27.030 --> 39:29.692
- I think I've loved you
for a while now.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.928
I just didn't realize it.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.064
- Then make me remember.

39:35.100 --> 39:36.590
I have to know.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.134
- OK, people!

39:41.170 --> 39:42.831
It's time.

39:45.850 --> 39:47.773
(Exhaling)

39:50.220 --> 39:52.416
(Speaking Latin)

39:57.790 --> 40:00.623
(Latin continues)

40:13.670 --> 40:15.809
(Aidan sobbing)

40:17.810 --> 40:18.777
- Aidan, Aidan!

40:18.810 --> 40:19.777
- Listen.

40:19.810 --> 40:20.902
- Hey!

40:20.950 --> 40:23.544
- What's the one thing
that gave me any hope?

40:23.580 --> 40:25.048
- Josh, hey!

40:25.090 --> 40:27.809
- I know you're confused,
but I can explain this, pal.

40:27.850 --> 40:28.817
All right?

40:28.860 --> 40:30.555
- This is on you.

40:33.090 --> 40:35.650
(Screaming)

40:35.700 --> 40:36.849
(All screaming)

40:36.900 --> 40:39.597
- Josh!
Oh my God!

40:39.630 --> 40:40.995
- Oh no!

40:43.870 --> 40:45.668
- Josh!

40:48.240 --> 40:49.674
(Woman): Roger that.

40:49.710 --> 40:51.474
(Man talking, indistinct)

40:51.510 --> 40:52.909
- Oh my God!

40:54.110 --> 40:55.544
Oh my God!

40:55.580 --> 40:57.548
** As the night falls *

40:57.580 --> 40:59.116
What did you do?

41:00.520 --> 41:01.555
Josh...

41:01.590 --> 41:03.080
* T lie awake for hours *

41:03.120 --> 41:04.258
* And it won't stop *

41:04.290 --> 41:05.951
- Sally, I am so sorry.

41:05.990 --> 41:07.822
- Hey! You're back.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.954
* This buzzing in my eardrum *

41:10.000 --> 41:11.559
- Who is that?

41:11.600 --> 41:14.092
- We called the police
for Robbie.

41:14.130 --> 41:16.098
I'm so sorry, we didn't
know what to do.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.960
You were gone all
night, and we just...

41:18.000 --> 41:19.968
We didn't wanna leave him.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.638
- Did we...do
the right thing?

41:24.310 --> 41:29.476
- Yeah. Oh my God,
I'm back to where I belong.

41:33.890 --> 41:36.109
Please tell me
you remember.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.629
* We lost control *

41:38.660 --> 41:41.994
- Uh, is this about
the showerhead?

41:42.030 --> 41:46.069
* In the end *

41:48.840 --> 41:50.763
* It falls apart *

41:50.800 --> 41:52.165
- Sally.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.632
* In the end *

41:53.670 --> 41:54.637
Sally...

41:54.680 --> 41:56.774
* It breaks my heart *

41:56.810 --> 41:58.744
Where did you go?

41:58.780 --> 42:00.544
- Oh my...

42:02.650 --> 42:05.950
I went to the past
a couple years ago,

42:05.990 --> 42:07.810
and then the future.

42:07.850 --> 42:10.558
<i>* 1 cannot seem 10 make sense *</i>

42:10.590 --> 42:12.058
- Wow.

42:12.090 --> 42:16.891
Like, next year the future
or, like, 2085 the future?

42:16.930 --> 42:20.298
- No, it felt really close.

42:20.330 --> 42:24.039
* And I search for a friendly
face among the memories *

42:24.070 --> 42:27.335
* But I'm scared as hell *

42:27.370 --> 42:31.307
* There's nothing
left here for us *

42:31.340 --> 42:35.174
* Ooh *

42:35.220 --> 42:39.282
* We lost control *

42:43.620 --> 42:47.955
* In the end *

42:49.300 --> 42:51.860
* It falls apart *

42:51.900 --> 42:55.336
* In the end **

42:57.700 --> 43:00.829
