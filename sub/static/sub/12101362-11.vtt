WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.170
Previously on Dynasty...

00:04.212 --> 00:05.338
I am pulling up the plans
to take the company public.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.048
ADAM:
The mass is a stage four

00:07.090 --> 00:08.717
glioblastoma.
I vowed to Blake

00:08.758 --> 00:10.051
to do everything
in my power

00:10.093 --> 00:11.553
to keep our
love alive.

00:11.594 --> 00:12.762
I need you to help me do that.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.014
We can buy our own club.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.348
I'm in.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.641
This whole modeling thing
has changed you.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.059
You're out of control!

00:18.101 --> 00:20.311
I'm doing what I have
to do for my career!

00:20.353 --> 00:22.480
I want you out of Atlanta...
permanently.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.065
I'd offer you
something to get you

00:24.107 --> 00:26.359
through it, but you did say
that was a one-time thing.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.029
Just to get through the party
and get this job.

00:29.988 --> 00:33.283
FALLON:
I may have said bourbon,
Amir, but you should know

00:33.324 --> 00:34.868
that I meant scotch
because my castle

00:34.909 --> 00:37.162
isn't in Kentucky,
it's in Scotland.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.248
Just be thankful I didn't fire
you for stealing that stapler.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.834
Fallon seems extra today.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.211
Yeah, her IPO roadshow starts
tomorrow.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.921
She's on edge.
Mm.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.215
I'm guessing it's not a
"traveling the countryside,

00:49.257 --> 00:52.093
looking for quaint
antiques" roadshow.
No.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.304
No, normally we would spend
a few weeks on the road

00:54.345 --> 00:56.723
pitching investment groups,
but we need to compress

00:56.765 --> 00:59.184
our timeline, so we're
bringing the road to us.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.935
Which means a marathon day
of meetings

01:00.977 --> 01:02.979
that could make or break
her public offering.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.523
That castle restoration really
put the company in the red.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.358
I had to restore the castle

01:07.400 --> 01:09.194
to get the land
for the offices.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.529
But thank you for reminding me
that if this IPO flops,

01:11.571 --> 01:13.073
I won't only be in major debt,

01:13.114 --> 01:15.200
but I also will have
destroyed my family dynasty.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.660
So forgive me
if I'm a little...
Melodramatic?

01:17.702 --> 01:20.538
Tense. Did you know
I'm one of only four women

01:20.580 --> 01:22.665
in America taking
a company public this year?

01:22.707 --> 01:24.876
Yes, I'm also the youngest ever.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.628
That sounds
incredible.
It is.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.254
And you have nothing
to worry about.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.215
I have an entire toolbox
full of closing techniques,

01:30.256 --> 01:32.050
and I'm happy to teach
a young dog old tricks.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.803
Aw, as much as I love
being compared to a canine,

01:34.844 --> 01:36.596
I think I'll pass
on your toolbox.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.807
This isn't the kind of
deal that can be closed

01:38.848 --> 01:41.059
with a handshake and a cigar
on the golf course.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.520
You know, C.A. wasn't just
some mom-and-pop operation.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.980
It was literally
you and your pop

01:46.022 --> 01:48.233
running a private company, but
since I'm taking mine public,

01:48.274 --> 01:50.485
I have to bring in the big guns,
which is why Jillian Van Horn

01:50.527 --> 01:52.445
is meeting us
at the office in ten.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.447
Jillian Van-who?
Van Horn.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.949
She took Spotify public.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.243
They call her the IPO
miracle-worker, which...

01:58.284 --> 01:59.828
isn't really
the best nickname, but...

01:59.869 --> 02:01.412
you get the point, so let's go.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
And I'll get you
up to speed.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.083
(sighs)

02:05.125 --> 02:06.459
Looks like I'm gonna miss

02:06.501 --> 02:08.294
the most important meal
of the day.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.921
And I think I'm gonna probably
end up working late tonight,

02:09.963 --> 02:12.507
too, so don't wait up for me.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.473
You're welcome for the refill.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.724
Although I'm not sure
you deserve it

02:21.766 --> 02:23.226
after how you treated Chloe.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.145
I simply asked
if the coffee beans

02:25.186 --> 02:26.604
were sustainably sourced.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.356
I like my caffeine ethical.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.899
As opposed to the rest
of your life?

02:29.941 --> 02:31.526
Mm.
Speaking of which,

02:31.568 --> 02:33.695
did you find a house yet?

02:33.736 --> 02:35.446
I will not be rushed
in real estate

02:35.488 --> 02:36.990
or breakfast ordering.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.908
I am paying for
my room, aren't I?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.493
Well, maybe you'd
like to upgrade

02:40.535 --> 02:42.078
to our presidential suite?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.080
I could use the extra cash
for the hotel expansion.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.248
There you are.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.292
Angry Anders.
I'm out of here.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.710
Are you insane?

02:48.751 --> 02:50.336
SAM:
Yes!

02:50.378 --> 02:52.088
What crawled up your culottes?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.923
You brought Oliver
to Atlanta,

02:53.965 --> 02:55.258
and put him up in this hotel?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.843
And clearly failed to pay
the staff enough

02:56.885 --> 02:58.052
for their discretion.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.596
You should be thanking me.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.015
You've been trying to end
Kirby and Adam for months.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.893
Not at the expense of
my daughter's wellbeing,

03:04.934 --> 03:06.644
which Oliver puts in danger.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.646
Kirby's wellbeing
is not my concern.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.648
(scoffs) Ah...

03:10.690 --> 03:12.609
But Adam's is.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.736
ANDERS (recorded voice):
Did you enjoy
watching her suffer?

03:14.777 --> 03:17.113
ADAM (recorded voice):
I made sure she slipped away
in her sleep,

03:17.155 --> 03:20.241
which is more than she deserved
after lying to me my whole life.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.870
How did you get that?

03:23.912 --> 03:27.081
The case involving Adam
and his fake mother is closed.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.876
Have Oliver on a plane
within 48 hours

03:29.918 --> 03:31.836
or this goes to the police.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.006
At which point, the case
will be unclosed.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.551
Do enjoy your breakfast.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.432
Good morning.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.435
Huh. Another night out
on the town with your ex?

03:48.978 --> 03:50.730
I promised you
I'd only see Oliver

03:50.772 --> 03:52.232
in a professional capacity,

03:52.273 --> 03:53.733
and that's all
I've been doing.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.110
Oh, right. So you were
professionally drinking,

03:56.152 --> 03:57.820
or professionally
doing drugs again.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.198
We were networking.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.534
Modelling is all about
who you know.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.870
To get the next job,
you have to make connections.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.997
Networking. Right.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.707
When you were trying
to get Chief of Staff,

04:09.749 --> 04:11.876
I did everything I could
to support you.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.878
I know I'm not a posh doctor,

04:13.920 --> 04:17.257
but a little support from you
would still be nice.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.217
Sorry, I just...

04:19.259 --> 04:21.636
I have a lot going on
at the hospital right now,

04:21.678 --> 04:23.513
and I... miss you.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.683
Can we have dinner
tomorrow night?

04:26.724 --> 04:29.811
Oh, I can't.
I have a shoot.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.688
At night? Again?

04:31.729 --> 04:34.232
Sam's letting us use the bar at
La Mirage, and we can't get in

04:34.274 --> 04:35.775
till after the last
dinner seating.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.485
Now, if
the interrogation's over,

04:37.527 --> 04:38.820
I really need to have a shower.

04:43.074 --> 04:46.077
Dominique. Hi.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.079
Um, this got delivered
to the main house for you.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.539
And you're delivering it
yourself?

04:49.580 --> 04:50.873
Should I get the
bomb-sniffing dogs?

04:50.915 --> 04:53.376
Not necessary.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.378
I've been looking for an excuse

04:55.420 --> 04:58.339
to stop by and say thank you.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.674
You played a big part in
getting the manor back

04:59.716 --> 05:01.301
from Alexis, and I'm grateful.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.762
Don't mention it.
She was a horrible landlord.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.056
(chuckles)
Look...

05:07.098 --> 05:08.683
family's important to Blake,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.727
and I'm really glad

05:10.768 --> 05:13.354
he's got his sister
in his life.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.690
I hope you'll stick around.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.942
Thanks.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.027
I guess you're wondering
why I've had

05:19.068 --> 05:20.570
so many packages recently.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.779
Actually, I should probably...

05:21.821 --> 05:24.824
I can tell you're curious.
(chuckles)

05:24.866 --> 05:28.369
Every year, the Atlanta
Fashion Council sponsors

05:28.411 --> 05:31.247
a runway show for
an up-and-coming designer,

05:31.289 --> 05:33.291
and I've been selected
as a finalist.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.586
Good for you.
I hope it works out.
Who knows,

05:36.627 --> 05:39.297
maybe next year you and Blake
can sit front row

05:39.339 --> 05:41.007
at my Paris fashion show.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.053
By next year,
this place will be on every

05:45.094 --> 05:46.679
must-see list in Atlanta.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.639
With the new venue next door
connecting La Mirage

05:48.681 --> 05:51.684
to Club Colby,
we'll have retail, dining

05:51.726 --> 05:53.728
and an event space
all in one.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.897
Like a little slice of Vegas.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.815
Except not like Vegas.
(both laugh)

05:57.857 --> 05:59.400
Please have a look.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.862
Hey, partner. I didn't think
I'd see you until later.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.073
Wait, did I mess up the time?

06:05.114 --> 06:06.908
No. 4:00 p.m. tennis practice.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.242
And thanks again for agreeing

06:08.284 --> 06:09.744
to play with me
in the tournament.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.120
You know the Children's Center
is a charity

06:11.162 --> 06:12.413
near and dear to my heart.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.040
Please, it's the least
I could do

06:14.082 --> 06:15.124
for my new business partner.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.043
Well, your business partner is

06:17.085 --> 06:18.920
actually here on business.

06:18.961 --> 06:22.256
Specifically, an astronomical
bill I just got for

06:22.298 --> 06:24.926
"swan-head purse hooks."

06:24.967 --> 06:26.761
I don't know what that means.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.679
They're an essential.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.598
And really, you don't need to
worry about this kind of thing.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.350
That's the benefit of being
a silent partner.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.143
Except that invoice
made me realize

06:34.185 --> 06:36.020
if I'm paying half the bills,
maybe I should be

06:36.062 --> 06:38.356
a little less silent. Plus...

06:38.398 --> 06:40.233
I majored in business.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.359
I might as well
make myself useful

06:41.401 --> 06:42.819
when it comes to
the bottom line.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.821
Well, I am happy to discuss
the bottom line,

06:44.862 --> 06:46.322
just not right now.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.615
I'm trying to solve
a construction issue.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.033
What issue?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.202
The hotel's a designated
historical building,

06:51.244 --> 06:53.955
so we need approval from
the city council to renovate,

06:53.996 --> 06:55.873
but they don't have any open
hearings for eight months.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.792
We can't afford to wait
eight months.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.168
I know.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.628
And I didn't even major
in business.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.672
I got the name
of a contractor

07:02.713 --> 07:03.965
that has an in
at the city council office.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.133
I'm meeting him at the hotel.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.717
Great. You can explain

07:06.759 --> 07:08.010
purse heads on our walk over.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.721
Mm, purse hooks,
swan heads.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.224
That's what I said.
No.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.393
Welcome to Fallon Unlimited,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.353
a multi-faceted media empire

07:17.395 --> 07:20.398
with a little something
for everyone.

07:20.440 --> 07:25.111
Our radio station syndicates
to 48 countries.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.196
Our publishing arm
covers books,

07:27.238 --> 07:29.824
print media and even
social platforms.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.078
Oh, remember, Fallon,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.371
you've got projectors
on three sides.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.374
You can't flap your wings.
Oh, yeah.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.542
Hey, good. You're just in time

07:39.584 --> 07:41.002
to watch me rehearse.
Take a seat.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.712
Oh, no, I've already
seen the show today.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.213
Hmm? What's this?

07:44.255 --> 07:47.550
That's the livestream of
Qualquest's IPO roadshow.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.093
Also produced by Jillian.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.762
TECH EXEC (over iPad):
Welcome to Qualquest,

07:51.804 --> 07:53.347
a multifaceted
biotechnology group

07:53.389 --> 07:55.224
with a little something
for everyone.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.435
Our researchers are
running trials

07:57.477 --> 07:58.895
in 22 countries.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.605
Holograms?

08:00.646 --> 08:02.231
IP-OMG.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.608
Do you only have one idea?

08:03.649 --> 08:05.276
No, I have a ton.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.320
What I don't have is time
to implement an entirely

08:07.361 --> 08:09.363
new concept on
such short notice.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.616
But you couldn't even write me
an original script?

08:11.657 --> 08:12.742
You don't need one.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.702
Qualquest is a biotech company.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.245
There's no overlap
in your target audiences.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.415
The head of a creative
media company

08:19.457 --> 08:21.542
can't just rip off
someone else's concept.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.127
That is the opposite
of creative.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.420
Let's not overreact.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.088
You're fired.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.632
What?
Mm-hmm.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.968
ALL:
Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.304
You heard 'em. Go.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.805
(scoffs)

08:36.015 --> 08:37.225
Oh.
Well, I guess it's time

08:37.266 --> 08:39.185
to get your damn toolbox out.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.436
Hmm?

08:40.478 --> 08:42.230
The metaphorical toolbox.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.106
The one we need to save
the company tomorrow.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.566
I really need it now.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.943
Yeah, I knew what you meant.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.653
I just wanted to hear you
say it again.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.654
Mm.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.989
♪ ♪

09:15.221 --> 09:17.765
Cristal, you okay?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.852
I want to make sure Blake
has happy memories

09:21.894 --> 09:23.229
when I'm gone,

09:23.271 --> 09:25.606
and that he doesn't forget me.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.732
That's a little maudlin.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.609
It's realistic.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.404
You said the chance of finding
a clinical trial for my cancer

09:31.445 --> 09:34.782
is about as likely as Blake
becoming a socialist, remember?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.951
Well, then, let's get him
a "Feel the Bern" sweatshirt.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.412
'Cause I found a drug trial
at the Halsted School

09:39.453 --> 09:41.831
for Medicine and Science
in Baltimore,

09:41.872 --> 09:43.749
and they're showing
promising results

09:43.791 --> 09:45.835
for shrinking lymphatic tumors.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.587
Talk to me like
I'm not a doctor.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.047
These tumors share a lot
of characteristics

09:50.089 --> 09:51.507
with the one you have,

09:51.549 --> 09:53.175
so if the drugs
work on them,

09:53.217 --> 09:54.635
there's a slight chance
they could work

09:54.677 --> 09:56.554
in shrinking
brain tumors, too.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.223
I already talked to the guy
who runs the study,

09:59.265 --> 10:00.850
and he's willing
to include you.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.311
Commuting to and from Baltimore

10:03.352 --> 10:05.021
would be hard to keep
from Blake,

10:05.062 --> 10:07.523
but maybe if I told him
I was joining

10:07.565 --> 10:08.858
the advisory board
for a charity up there...

10:08.899 --> 10:11.444
Actually,
it's an inpatient program,

10:11.485 --> 10:13.904
so you'd have to relocate
for six to eight weeks.

10:16.073 --> 10:19.493
I can't move to Baltimore
to join a study

10:19.535 --> 10:21.746
that isn't even
for brain tumors

10:21.787 --> 10:23.289
for a slight chance.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.666
If it works, this could
improve your eligibility for

10:25.708 --> 10:28.169
for surgery by five
to ten percent.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.547
So that's a 95% chance that
these are my final months.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.300
I don't want to spend them
living apart.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.761
Well, if you told him the truth,
he could go with you.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.971
So his final memories
of our marriage will be

10:39.013 --> 10:40.890
hospital food and grief?

10:40.931 --> 10:42.642
What about your family?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.727
Are you even planning
on telling them?

10:44.769 --> 10:47.229
My father and I had
a falling out.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.940
So, no, I'm not,
and it's fine.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.443
I appreciate the trouble
you've gone to,

10:52.485 --> 10:54.153
but... I'm sorry.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.907
What if the trial were
local and outpatient?

10:57.948 --> 11:00.743
What if we could do this
without Blake knowing about it?

11:00.785 --> 11:02.328
Would you do it then?

11:02.370 --> 11:03.788
Theoretically? Yes.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.331
That's all I need to know.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.378
Can I ask you why you're
doing all this for me?

11:10.419 --> 11:14.090
I'm grateful,
but considering our history...

11:14.131 --> 11:16.342
That's all it is, history.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.177
You're family.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.554
Family's
the most important thing.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.976
LEO:
Your architect did a nice job.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.230
Getting you on the schedule for
next week should be no problem.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.564
Great.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.149
That easy?

11:32.191 --> 11:34.568
Yeah. My cousin manages
the city council office.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.613
And you're just doing this
just to be a nice guy?

11:37.655 --> 11:39.115
I'm a businessman.

11:39.156 --> 11:40.908
I charge an administrative fee.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.119
That's fine with us.
Unless...

11:43.160 --> 11:44.578
You guys hire
a construction crew yet?

11:44.620 --> 11:45.830
'Cause I'd be willing to waive

11:45.871 --> 11:47.581
my fee if you use my crew.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.709
A project just fell through.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.128
That sounds amazing.
When can you start?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.799
(chuckles) As soon as
city council approves us.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.759
I'll be in touch.
Thank you.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.681
Why are you not happy
about this?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.766
You just hired that guy
without asking me.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.643
Or checking his references.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.563
Another hotelier recommended
Leo-- that is his reference.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.273
That might be how you work,
but I like

12:12.314 --> 12:14.525
to dot my I's and cross my T's.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.068
That's business 101.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.320
Maybe, but while you're
busy crossing your eyes,

12:18.362 --> 12:20.698
Leo will take another job
and we'll lose

12:20.740 --> 12:22.533
a good crew
and our spot on the schedule.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.078
Things in the hospitality
industry move really fast.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.373
This is my area of expertise,
so just trust me, okay?

12:30.833 --> 12:34.420
Fallon Unlimited
also prides itself

12:34.462 --> 12:37.423
on fostering
an inclusive environment,

12:37.465 --> 12:40.760
with women and people of
color making up over 50%

12:40.801 --> 12:43.262
of our board-- What?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.139
Oh, save that
for the snowflakes.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.349
Investors want to hear
about the numbers.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.310
I think we should
call it a night.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.270
No. No, we can't.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.522
Jillian already told investors

12:53.564 --> 12:56.734
that we have, you know,
"consciously uncoupled."

12:56.776 --> 12:59.570
Just makes it sound
like I'm some sort of diva

12:59.612 --> 13:01.238
who's impossible to work with.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.282
Amir, why would I want
a cake pop? I'm not six.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.201
Which is obviously not true.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.037
Okay, but you need to use
more tools from my toolbox.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.705
Remember my ABCs?

13:09.747 --> 13:11.540
Accuse, blackmail, cheat.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.667
Accuse the competition
of misbehaving,

13:13.709 --> 13:15.336
always have blackmail
and, if necessary,

13:15.377 --> 13:17.087
you cheat on the financials.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.548
I still can't believe
that your epic toolbox

13:19.590 --> 13:22.760
basically boils down
to "lie, cheat, and steal."

13:22.802 --> 13:25.346
I mean, some of your schmoozing
tips might work, but...

13:25.387 --> 13:27.181
everything is scrutinized
in the public sector.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.682
And I don't want to lie.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.267
I want to do this my way.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.769
Which is what?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.813
Proving that
the Carrington dynasty is more

13:33.854 --> 13:35.940
than just failed marriages,
a torched vineyard,

13:35.981 --> 13:37.399
and two bodies in a lake.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.026
We're a reputable company.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.945
Don't be naive.
No one's gonna care

13:40.986 --> 13:42.655
how many bodies were in the lake

13:42.696 --> 13:43.906
if you're
successful.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.699
Business is business.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.118
Which means doing whatever
it takes to close the deal.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.246
Use the entire toolbox,
all right?

13:50.287 --> 13:52.456
A hammer without a nail
is just a hammer.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.959
It's also a hammer with a nail.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.795
But, yeah, I guess
we're just gonna have to...

13:57.837 --> 14:00.840
agree to disagree
on how we do this.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.510
Wonderful incorporation
of structure and texture.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.178
You've got
a good eye.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.680
I'd like to think so.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.181
I look forward to seeing
your proof of concept.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.558
Mm.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.856
Does anyone have a hose?

14:16.897 --> 14:20.776
Because these designs are
on fire.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.945
Oh, my God, thank you!

14:22.987 --> 14:24.446
PJ: Okay,
everybody,

14:24.488 --> 14:26.407
we are going
to break now.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.993
When we get back,
it's final-step time.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.495
We'll be evaluating
your sample designs,

14:31.537 --> 14:33.706
so be sure to set up
your dress forms

14:33.747 --> 14:35.624
how you'd like
us to see them.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.352
What are you doing in my room?

14:55.394 --> 14:56.979
The security
in this place is terrible.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.565
Since I'm paying,
it's technically my room.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.401
Cheer up,
today is your lucky day.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.029
I am going to pay you
the rest of what I owe you,

15:05.070 --> 15:07.865
and then you can hop on back
to Australia.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.325
Why?

15:09.366 --> 15:10.951
Adam and Kirby are
barely speaking.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.786
I just need a few more days.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.580
(chuckles)
Please.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.206
No, thanks.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.875
I'm set.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.376
This job is good for my career

15:19.418 --> 15:21.128
and the money will be good
when I get paid.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.467
I can make your life
very difficult

15:26.508 --> 15:28.135
if you stick around.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.387
I like Atlanta.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.181
And I like Kirby.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.099
So I'll take my chances.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.935
Now get out of my suite

15:35.976 --> 15:37.853
before I tell your son
who's funding it.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.986
Fallon Unlimited prioritizes

15:46.028 --> 15:48.155
diversity and inclusion.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.823
Our board is comprised

15:49.865 --> 15:52.910
of over 50% women
and people of color.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.495
Now I'd like to direct
your attention

15:54.536 --> 15:56.038
to our prospectus.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.291
As you can see, our five-year
projections show gains

15:59.333 --> 16:01.585
across the board.
(quietly):
♪ A, B, C ♪

16:01.627 --> 16:04.421
♪ D. ♪
And, um...

16:04.463 --> 16:07.132
um, when you invest in us...

16:08.384 --> 16:11.053
...you'll never have to worry
about a national news anchor

16:11.095 --> 16:12.930
at your company
passed out in his trailer

16:12.972 --> 16:15.182
forcing his DUI victims
to sign NDAs.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.601
Hold on, who are we
talking about here?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.561
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Just like I told the guys

16:19.603 --> 16:21.772
before you, I don't traffic
in rumors, so...

16:21.814 --> 16:24.024
What happens at Fairfax
stays at Fairfax.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.359
Fairfax?

16:25.401 --> 16:26.902
Pilman Media Group?

16:26.944 --> 16:30.239
Look, let's just focus
on investing in a company

16:30.280 --> 16:32.866
that is scandal-free
and exponentially growing.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.493
Now who wants some scotch

16:34.535 --> 16:37.162
while I walk you through
our castle renovation, yeah?

16:37.204 --> 16:38.789
(investors murmuring)

16:40.582 --> 16:42.501
Is any of that true?

16:42.543 --> 16:44.044
It will be...

16:44.086 --> 16:45.921
after you make it true.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.007
(chuckling)

16:53.554 --> 16:55.347
Oh, I didn't expect
you to join me.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.392
Well, I didn't expect to go
bald, but these things happen.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.352
I hope you called me here

17:00.394 --> 17:02.604
to tell me that Oliver is
halfway around the world.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.690
If by "the world,"
you mean "this hotel"

17:04.732 --> 17:06.984
and by "halfway,"
you mean "six floors up"?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.444
Yes.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.946
I always knew you were
a dreadful mother,

17:10.988 --> 17:13.657
but I didn't think you'd let
your own son go to prison.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.367
What am I supposed to do?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.494
Oliver likes your daughter
and doesn't want to leave.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.247
Surely you must have
a deceitful trick or three

17:20.289 --> 17:22.332
up those pinstriped sleeves
of yours?

17:22.374 --> 17:24.960
Why don't you use one of those
on someone other than Kirby?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.378
If you are so worried
about Kirby,

17:26.420 --> 17:28.047
why don't you talk to her?

17:28.088 --> 17:29.882
I tried that.

17:29.923 --> 17:33.343
Kirby is not very rational
when it comes to Oliver.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.888
Maybe you should try
some tough love.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.724
You can be kind of a pushover.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.310
Well, this pushover is just

17:41.351 --> 17:44.772
24 hours away
from going to the police.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.030
Sure.
Thank you.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.365
Congratulations.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.951
40% of your future shares
pledged.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.495
Yeah, except I feel

17:59.536 --> 18:01.580
like I need a shower
after lying like that.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.290
Well, that feeling
goes away.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.001
Besides, it's not lying
if it's the truth.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.212
Some very colorful
HR complaints

18:08.253 --> 18:09.797
about a certain company
have already been

18:09.838 --> 18:11.340
leaked to The Times.
We're all set.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.467
Okay, so now we just need

18:13.509 --> 18:15.469
Trask Global Media
to make the same pledge

18:15.511 --> 18:16.887
this afternoon and our IPO

18:16.929 --> 18:18.430
will be bulletproof.
Mm-hmm.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.224
What do we know
about Warren Trask?

18:20.265 --> 18:22.518
He's worth
about 40 billion,

18:22.559 --> 18:24.812
lives in a split-level
in the West End

18:24.853 --> 18:26.522
and still drives
a '93 Pontiac.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.398
So he's cheap.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.400
I'm thinking we go with C.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.194
We cheat a little
on the restoration numbers,

18:32.236 --> 18:34.071
to minimize
our asset to debt ratio.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.531
I don't think
I've ever been more proud.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.700
Except our financials are
in the public now.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.994
So if this guy does
his due diligence,

18:41.036 --> 18:42.830
then he's gonna see
that the numbers are off.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.833
You know that good ol' boys'
club you disdain?
Mm-hmm.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.752
Trask's brokerage firm is
practically the clubhouse.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.337
Look, I'll just call in
some favors,

18:50.379 --> 18:51.880
and make sure he sees
what we want him to see.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.299
Great, and then next month
maybe we could get

18:54.341 --> 18:55.759
the castle numbers down?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.469
You know,
so it's actually the truth.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.763
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the truth is
more your wheelhouse.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.349
So, we'll deal
with that later.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.268
As the chief of staff,

19:04.309 --> 19:05.936
I want to put
this hospital on the map,

19:05.978 --> 19:07.437
elevate our profile, so...

19:07.479 --> 19:10.732
I propose partnering
with Halsted Medical

19:10.774 --> 19:12.693
on an oncological
research trial.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.570
KAREN:
Not happening.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.655
All the research money for the
fiscal year has been allotted

19:16.697 --> 19:18.115
to the interns you brought in.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.117
So let's just get creative
with the numbers.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.994
Just move some things around.

19:22.035 --> 19:25.706
We got half a million dollars
from the Rosenthal fund.

19:25.747 --> 19:28.167
That's designated to upgrade
our radiology equipment.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.419
A research trial isn't
feasible right now.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.920
Bring it up again in six months.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.715
No, I-I don't have
that kind of time.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.510
We-we don't-- we could be
saving more lives.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.304
And we will, just not with that.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.515
Let's turn
to the janitorial budget.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.940
Housekeeping.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.252
They always say the first thing
to go is the memory.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.797
Card.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.392
(laughing)

20:27.434 --> 20:29.228
Okay.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.021
(gasps)

20:31.063 --> 20:33.398
Where have you been? What does
a cheap billionaire drink?

20:33.440 --> 20:34.691
Should I lose the scotch?

20:34.733 --> 20:36.193
I was talking
to your assistant.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.819
And, unfortunately,
none of this matters.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.238
Trask cancelled.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.241
What? No, no, he can't cancel.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.826
If he doesn't invest, then
we won't hit our target number,

20:44.868 --> 20:47.162
which means the IPO flops
and I'll have to sell assets

20:47.204 --> 20:49.915
to pay for the restoration of
a castle I don't even live in.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.833
Not to mention the humiliation

20:51.875 --> 20:53.877
of being the youngest woman ever
to tank an IPO.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.671
Why are you yelling at me?
It's not my fault

20:55.712 --> 20:57.381
he went in
for an emergency root canal.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.800
Root canal? And he couldn't come
to a simple meeting?

20:59.841 --> 21:01.635
My God, suck it up.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.970
You know what? No.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.972
We will reschedule him
for dinner.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.475
We'll woo him over red wine,
soft foods and painkillers.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.186
Yeah, I tried. It's his
daughter's sweet sixteen.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.562
Apparently,
he's not missing that

21:12.604 --> 21:14.231
no matter how drugged up he is.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.150
Then I guess we're crashing
a sweet sixteen party.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.571
(gasps)
My dress!

21:21.613 --> 21:24.032
Bold use of gemstones,
Kitty-Kat.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.410
I didn't do that.
Someone vandalized my sample.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.828
I'd suggest calling
the fashion police,

21:27.869 --> 21:30.414
but they'd probably arrest you
for bad taste.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.124
I need to talk to the judges.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.709
Afraid it's
too late

21:33.750 --> 21:35.961
for that.
Thank you all
for your patience

21:36.003 --> 21:38.297
as we evaluated
your prototypes.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.590
We were judging
not only your design ability,

21:40.632 --> 21:42.592
but technical skill as well.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.720
I know it's been a long day,
so we won't keep you waiting

21:44.761 --> 21:46.513
any longer.
E-Excuse me.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.974
Someone can't wait to make
her acceptance speech, I see.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.559
That's right, Kat,

21:50.600 --> 21:52.853
the Atlanta Fashion Council
will be sponsoring

21:52.894 --> 21:54.813
your runway show
at Fashion Week.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.064
Oh, my God! Thank you!

21:59.443 --> 22:01.194
I'm sorry, but is this a joke?

22:01.236 --> 22:03.113
That dress is a tacky nightmare.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.324
Of course it is.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.492
This was never
about the clothes.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.495
Kat's got
500,000 Instagram followers

22:10.537 --> 22:12.998
and a lot of years
left in the tank.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.168
She's just a little more, uh,
on brand for us.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.296
Thanks for
applying.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.589
Hmm!

22:20.630 --> 22:21.923
(indistinct chatter)

22:21.965 --> 22:23.467
We're starting
in two minutes.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.926
What's up with the phone?

22:24.968 --> 22:26.511
Trying to track
down those hooks.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.555
They were supposed to
get here this morning.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.557
Oh, they're not coming.
I cancelled the order.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.434
Too expensive.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.686
Budgets are my area
of expertise.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.313
Trust me.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.773
Interesting.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.650
Mind if I serve first for us?

22:40.692 --> 22:42.235
(sighs):
Sure.

remember shelling out

for a custom Porsche.
Hmm.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.537
All right,
let's find Trask.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.497
Once you pull out
Blake's greatest hits,

24:17.539 --> 24:19.374
we'll be home free.

Tempting,

but I'll pass.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.852
Quick question:

24:38.894 --> 24:41.188
Who are you, and what
are you doing at my party?

24:41.229 --> 24:43.440
My dad invite you?

24:44.399 --> 24:46.443
I'm Fallon Carrington. Hi.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.529
Let me guess.
You were a TriDelt at Princeton?

24:49.571 --> 24:51.740
Nope.
Just a regular bitch at NYU.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.492
So why are you here?

24:53.533 --> 24:56.661
My dad's decided
I have to go to Princeton.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.580
You could do worse
than Princeton.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.040
Not the point.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.584
I'm so over him thinking
he knows better than me.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.127
He doesn't believe
I'm smart enough

25:04.169 --> 25:06.213
to do things
my own way.
Okay,

25:06.254 --> 25:09.007
I mean,
he has decades of experience,

25:09.049 --> 25:11.176
and he is the sixth richest man
in the world,

25:11.218 --> 25:13.595
so that should count
for something.
Yeah.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.264
It counts for how old
and out of touch he is.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.683
He's always talking about
how I need a job after school.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.685
My TikTok takes
ten times more work

25:20.727 --> 25:22.979
that scooping ice cream,
and it pays a ton.

25:23.021 --> 25:26.274
My latest post has
250,000 unique interactions.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.027
And that translates
to a steady income how?

25:29.069 --> 25:30.403
I'm a skinfluencer.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.949
I do ironic punk princess
makeup tutorials.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.576
And when you've got
four million followers,

25:36.618 --> 25:39.579
big brands fork over cash
for sponcon challenges.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.581
I was gonna do
a new one tonight,

25:41.623 --> 25:43.458
but my dad won't even play
my favorite song:

25:43.500 --> 25:45.293
"Drivers License."

25:45.335 --> 25:48.755
Oh. Well, yeah, I mean, that's
a little sad and depressing

25:48.797 --> 25:50.632
for tonight's theme,
don't you think?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.217
It's supposed to be my party.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.303
And I guess
you'll cry if you want to.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.680
You're so lucky.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.558
To be old
and make your own decisions.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.934
Totally.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.645
#OldAndBlessed.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.364
You two look like
you're working hard.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.992
What are you
doing here?

26:17.033 --> 26:21.121
Oh, I came to be
more supportive of your career,

26:21.162 --> 26:23.164
but I suppose
that ship has sailed.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.541
The shoot got
cancelled.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.750
Someone broke into
Ollie's hotel room

26:25.792 --> 26:27.377
and wrecked
his equipment.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.379
Poor Ollie. I guess
you had to stay and console him.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.799
Well, whoever did it also sent
the models pervy photos

26:32.841 --> 26:34.175
from his e-mail.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.760
The magazine fired him.

26:35.802 --> 26:39.764
So, yeah, I stayed to
console my friend.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.600
He seemed pretty good
when I walked in.

26:41.641 --> 26:42.642
Relax, mate.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.810
I'm not your mate.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.312
And this is none
of your business.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.813
Especially now that
you're unemployed.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.773
Kirby, can we go?

26:49.983 --> 26:52.152
Go on. I'll be fine.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.029
Can't just leave him here, Adam.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.072
Don't you see
that he's playing you?

26:56.114 --> 26:57.741
What's that supposed to mean?

26:57.782 --> 26:59.159
It means that when I came by
the shoot the other night,

26:59.200 --> 27:00.785
he was practically groping you.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.912
I walk in now, he's groping you,

27:02.954 --> 27:05.790
and there's no shoot.
No one was
groping anyone.

27:05.832 --> 27:08.460
And you don't find it convenient
that his camera was vandalized,

27:08.501 --> 27:10.920
like the other day
when his photos were corrupted?

27:13.715 --> 27:15.216
Happy?

27:15.258 --> 27:17.260
You could have done that
yourself. I would have.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.054
Can we please just talk
about this at home?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.017
Kirby wants to stay.
Maybe you back off.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.649
I can't do this anymore.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.609
Come home with me, or...

27:32.651 --> 27:34.361
or we're done.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.781
Well, I'm staying, so...

27:37.822 --> 27:39.532
I guess we're done.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.826
You can't be serious.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.828
Your mother was right
about you.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.622
What do you know
about my mother?

27:45.664 --> 27:48.124
I know she paid me to come here
and break you two up.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.959
I barely had
to do anything.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.170
You wrecked this
all on your own.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.382
ADAM:
Kirby, you knew
about this?
No.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.008
But it just makes me realize

27:57.050 --> 27:59.052
how much I need
to stay away from you

27:59.094 --> 28:01.054
and your family.
Yeah.

28:09.270 --> 28:11.564
Okay, I did a little recon.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.566
It turns out the root canal
was just an excuse.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.694
Apparently, Trask thinks the
only investment worth making

28:15.735 --> 28:17.779
in a woman your age is
a new set of boobs

28:17.821 --> 28:19.239
for his third wife.
Uh...

28:19.280 --> 28:20.907
His words, not mine.
Well, that's great.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.951
So we crashed
a child's birthday party

28:22.992 --> 28:26.121
just to hit a dead end
with an ageist misogynist?

28:26.162 --> 28:28.164
Not so fast.
Look, he'll do whatever we say

28:28.206 --> 28:29.749
once you whip out
Blake's favorite tool.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.334
You hear how that sounds, right?

28:31.376 --> 28:33.002
I'm talking about blackmail.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.338
But do I really want an investor
who has to be blackmailed

28:35.380 --> 28:36.548
into backing me?

28:36.589 --> 28:38.299
Yes. The stakes are too high

28:38.341 --> 28:40.552
for you to die
on a hill of morality

28:40.593 --> 28:42.303
right now.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.724
It's not about morality.

28:45.765 --> 28:49.102
It's about doing this my way.
If you walk away now,

28:49.144 --> 28:50.562
the only person
you'll be hurting is yourself.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.313
I don't care.
Because you know what?

28:52.355 --> 28:54.983
At least if I fail, I will
be failing on my own terms.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.026
And I can at least give
the birthday girl

28:57.068 --> 28:58.695
a gift she actually wants.

Adam.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.660
Are you okay?
How could you?

30:28.701 --> 30:29.744
How could I...?

30:29.786 --> 30:31.663
Drop the act, Mother.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.165
Every time I think you've found
an ounce of maternal instinct,

30:34.207 --> 30:35.708
you prove me wrong--
but you...

30:35.750 --> 30:37.710
you've gone too far
this time.
Oh, please.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.796
You will thank
me eventually.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.006
That Tasmanian trollop was
never good enough for you.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.300
No, the only person who's
not good enough for me is you.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.552
(gasps softly)

30:45.593 --> 30:47.053
We're done.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.056
Adam...
No.

30:51.015 --> 30:54.310
I really don't think
I could ever forgive you.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.980
(door closes)

30:58.940 --> 31:01.025
Thanks for coming.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.318
Beer?

31:02.360 --> 31:03.778
(exhales)

31:03.820 --> 31:05.822
I won't bill you for
half of it, I promise.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.574
(laughs)

31:08.783 --> 31:10.660
Look...

31:10.702 --> 31:13.746
I've been running the hotel by
myself for the last two years,

31:13.788 --> 31:16.624
and I guess I am just not used
to waiting for someone else

31:16.666 --> 31:19.168
to weigh in.
I know. I get it, but...

31:19.210 --> 31:21.838
But that's no excuse.
I trust your judgment,

31:21.880 --> 31:24.757
and I shouldn't have hired Leo
without talking to you first.

31:24.799 --> 31:27.635
And I should have listened
to you about the budget.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.138
So I'm sorry.

31:30.179 --> 31:32.557
So am I.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.767
I may have been
a little overeager

31:34.809 --> 31:37.186
about hitting the budget thing
so hard.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.771
And after you left,

31:38.813 --> 31:40.815
I had to finish out our match
with a ball boy.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.191
(chuckles)
We lost.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.568
Quickly.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.486
You and I are clearly
a good team.

31:45.528 --> 31:46.946
We are.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.990
And then,
I stopped at The High Beam

31:49.032 --> 31:51.117
for a drink
and to feel sorry for myself,

31:51.159 --> 31:53.077
but I had all of our bags,

31:53.119 --> 31:56.623
and there wasn't a single
damn place to hang them.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.333
Purse hooks.
Purse hooks.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.876
You were right. (chuckles)

31:59.918 --> 32:02.295
I've obviously got a lot
to learn about design.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.672
And I've got a lot to learn
about trusting my partner.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.050
Tomorrow, I'll tell Leo
we need to take a step back

32:07.091 --> 32:09.510
so you and I can make
this decision together.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.137
And don't worry,

32:11.179 --> 32:13.306
I know you hit me with the ball
by mistake.

32:13.348 --> 32:16.309
Yeah. It was totally a mistake.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.560
Mm-hmm.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.853
(chuckles)

32:18.895 --> 32:20.980
(playing piano)

32:22.482 --> 32:24.359
How did it go?

32:24.400 --> 32:26.778
(stops playing)
With Kirby?

32:26.819 --> 32:28.821
No, with the hospital board.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.532
Cristal, I'm...
It's okay.

32:31.574 --> 32:33.785
I knew it was a long shot.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.037
Thank you for trying.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.166
They approved it.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.126
What? Really?

32:42.168 --> 32:44.545
We can start treatment
next week in Atlanta.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.547
I'll give you all
the details tomorrow.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.424
(sighs)
This is so great.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.676
Thank you.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.310
(footsteps approaching)

33:01.312 --> 33:03.356
Oh...

33:03.398 --> 33:05.400
Please tell me that's
not the last piece

33:05.441 --> 33:07.318
of Mrs. Gunnerson's
chess pie.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.862
I was really counting on that
to get me through the shame

33:09.904 --> 33:11.906
of destroying
my family dynasty.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.866
Also, I didn't eat anything
at the sweet sixteen.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.868
It is the last piece.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.078
(scoffs)
I would say sorry,

33:17.120 --> 33:18.913
but this pie is
my only consolation

33:18.955 --> 33:22.458
in a world in which apparently
I'm too old to compete.
Mm.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.127
If it makes you feel any better,

33:24.168 --> 33:27.422
tonight I was passed over
for being too young.

33:27.463 --> 33:31.217
Evidently there is no right age
to be a woman in business.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.344
It would be one thing
if it was about the work.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.346
I did really good work.

33:35.388 --> 33:38.933
But one old man doesn't think
I'm marketable, so that's it.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.978
Turns out you still have
to be a blonde pixie

33:42.020 --> 33:43.771
with a half a million
Instagram followers

33:43.813 --> 33:45.815
to make it past
the gatekeepers.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.191
You're right.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.359
Maybe...

33:48.401 --> 33:49.902
we can't wait for the patriarchy

33:49.944 --> 33:51.446
to decide we're worthy.

33:51.487 --> 33:54.365
Maybe we have to do this
our way,

33:54.407 --> 33:55.867
until we can't be denied.

33:55.908 --> 33:58.327
(laughs)
Thank you, Dominique.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.499
ANDERS:
It's almost dawn.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.084
Where have you been?

34:06.294 --> 34:08.921
Out.
Uh, that's not
a good enough answer.

34:08.963 --> 34:11.799
Fine. Out with Oliver.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.509
Do I need to remind you

34:13.551 --> 34:15.386
that the last time
you got involved with Oliver,

34:15.428 --> 34:16.637
you went to jail?

34:16.679 --> 34:18.056
And what would you know
about it?

34:18.097 --> 34:19.599
You weren't even around.

34:19.640 --> 34:22.393
I've always watched out for you,
wherever I was.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.354
Well, who do you think
paid for your barrister?
Gee, thanks.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.648
Let me just go find
your "father of the year" award.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.609
Do you really want to go back
to all that?

34:29.650 --> 34:31.778
You robbed a nursing home,
for God's sake.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.654
Spare me the lecture.
I'm an adult.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.239
Now you see,
that's

34:35.281 --> 34:36.699
the first thing you've said
that I agree with.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.993
You are an adult,
and you are free

34:39.035 --> 34:40.870
to you live your life
any way you like.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.371
Just not here.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.373
And not like this.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.501
♪ ♪

34:47.668 --> 34:49.212
So you're kicking me out?

34:49.253 --> 34:51.547
Unless you decide you want
to change your behavior.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.673
(scoffs softly)

34:54.050 --> 34:55.468
(chuckles)

34:55.510 --> 34:56.844
So, there's nothing further
to discuss.

34:56.886 --> 35:00.139
Trust me,
for your own good.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.976
When you're ready,
I'll be here.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.312
No, you won't.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.231
Because all you've ever done
is abandon me.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.414
Leo, hey.
Thanks for coming.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.416
So, we should have a date set
for your hearing

35:27.458 --> 35:29.669
by the end of the day.
(sighs)

35:29.710 --> 35:31.337
Great news.
Yep.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.713
The crew's gonna stop
by here later

35:32.755 --> 35:34.757
to look at the site.
Stick around.

35:34.799 --> 35:35.883
You'll be spending
a lot of time with them

35:35.925 --> 35:37.385
over the next couple of months.

35:37.426 --> 35:38.886
You should probably get
used to the faces.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.472
Yeah, I need to talk to you
about that.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.474
You see, um,

35:43.516 --> 35:46.060
hiring your crew might have been
a little premature,

35:46.102 --> 35:47.645
and we need to pump
the brakes.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.231
My partner and I
want to evaluate

35:50.273 --> 35:52.775
all our options before
we completely commit to you.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.528
No problem. I get it.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.113
You do?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.115
Thanks for understanding.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.075
Just like I'm sure
you get that...

36:01.117 --> 36:03.744
I can't guarantee you a spot
on the council schedule

36:03.786 --> 36:05.454
if we're no longer
working together.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.081
Whether we hire you or not,

36:07.123 --> 36:09.500
I'm happy to pay
your administrative fee.
Thing is...

36:09.542 --> 36:12.295
I just don't know
if I can trust you anymore.

36:12.336 --> 36:15.256
And my guys really
don't like it

36:15.298 --> 36:17.216
when someone goes back
on their word.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.385
Well, I'm sure, but...

36:19.427 --> 36:21.137
What can I say?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.722
They're hotheads.

36:22.763 --> 36:26.684
Sometimes they act out
in not so pleasant ways.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.312
I'm sure your hotel
will be fine, though.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.981
Is this some kind of threat?

36:32.023 --> 36:33.941
It's, uh...

36:33.983 --> 36:36.360
free advice.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.198
Uh...

36:40.239 --> 36:42.617
You know what?
Forget I said anything.

36:42.658 --> 36:44.952
We'll use your crew.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.120
They sound great.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.914
Perfect.

36:47.955 --> 36:49.665
I'll give you a call in a couple
of hours about that hearing.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.671
Drinking breakfast again?
(scoffs)

36:55.713 --> 36:57.048
Never a good sign.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.466
Adam found out what I did

36:58.507 --> 37:00.092
and never wants
to speak to me again.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.261
And since Oliver is
still in town,

37:02.303 --> 37:05.223
I can only assume that you are
going from here to the police.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.849
Oh. (chuckles)

37:06.891 --> 37:08.726
I am not.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.145
Same, please.
Excuse me?

37:11.187 --> 37:14.565
Last night, I asked Kirby
to leave the manor.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.859
I don't know when
I'll talk to her again.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.653
So you went with tough love?

37:18.694 --> 37:20.446
I did what I had to do.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.824
The point is, you and I
have already lost a child.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.534
And now I've lost
a second one.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.662
If there's any chance
that you can repair

37:27.703 --> 37:29.038
your relationship with Adam,

37:29.080 --> 37:30.373
I'm not gonna get in the way.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.041
I destroyed the recording.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.043
Your son is safe.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.587
(sighs) Thank you.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.589
Thank you.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.758
They sure don't
make it easy, do they?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.510
(both chuckle)

37:42.551 --> 37:44.220
To parenthood.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.888
Indeed.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.350
$40 a share?
That can't be right.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.102
Oh, it's right
all right.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.687
What, did Trask have
a change of heart?

37:52.728 --> 37:54.897
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.440
In fact,
he might have actually filed

37:56.482 --> 37:57.984
a restraining order
against me.

37:58.025 --> 38:00.403
Fortunately, he's not
the only Trask with clout.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.737
Oh, what, does
he have a brother?

38:01.779 --> 38:03.614
Ah, and the patriarchy rides
again.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.658
No, Candy--
the birthday girl--

38:05.700 --> 38:07.285
she has a huge following
on TikTok.

38:07.326 --> 38:08.869
And after we left,

38:08.911 --> 38:11.414
she created an original audio
Dubsmash challenge

38:11.455 --> 38:12.415
of my performance.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.916
Yeah. Translation, please.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.002
All you need to know
is that it went viral,

38:16.043 --> 38:18.462
and now a huge celebrities
like Lizzo want

38:18.504 --> 38:20.214
a piece of this scrappy,
female-owned business.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.883
Well, sometimes all you need is
a little luck.

38:22.925 --> 38:25.428
Luck? Luck you.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.555
My PR team worked overnight
to make this happen.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.140
And with what I'm paying them
in overtime,

38:29.181 --> 38:30.558
I wouldn't be surprised
if they're all laying

38:30.599 --> 38:31.684
on a yacht in Mykonos right now.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.437
Well, I am impressed, huh?

38:34.478 --> 38:36.814
Hey, another tool
for our toolbox.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.149
Yeah, about that...

38:38.190 --> 38:40.735
There's not gonna be
a toolbox anymore.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.278
Or an "our."

38:44.864 --> 38:46.824
Are you firing me?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.994
I don't believe in labels,
but yes.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.620
I am.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.080
I mean, if the sweet sixteen
taught me anything,

38:53.122 --> 38:55.124
it's that fathers are fathers.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.376
I value your opinion so much

38:57.418 --> 39:00.963
that I second-guess myself
when I need to stand on my own.

39:01.005 --> 39:04.050
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.926
I'm very proud of you.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.553
You're gonna do great
without me.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.305
Thank you.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.266
Oh, I did get you
a going away present.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.768
Do you remember that, uh,

39:13.809 --> 39:15.936
private airline company
you wanted me to buy?

39:15.978 --> 39:17.605
Yeah.
Primetime Private Air.

39:17.646 --> 39:20.274
I bought it
and I'm giving it to you.

39:22.985 --> 39:25.446
Well, this is
a very generous severance.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.782
Maybe I'll be able to finally
get my pilot's license.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.742
I can take you someplace fun
for your 30th birthday.

39:31.285 --> 39:33.621
Or you could just get me
another Porsche.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.877
Are you okay?

39:43.339 --> 39:45.299
It's probably
best this way,

39:45.341 --> 39:48.260
not having to see her
at breakfast every morning.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.391
You've done so much for me.

39:53.432 --> 39:55.601
I mean,
beyond what I ever expected.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.771
So if there's anything
I can do to help,

39:58.813 --> 40:01.065
just say the word.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.908
ADAM:
Karen?

40:10.950 --> 40:12.868
Hey, um, I wanted to talk
to you about using

40:12.910 --> 40:14.495
the Rosenthal grant money

40:14.537 --> 40:16.539
for the research trial
I was telling you about.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.998
You mentioned that
in the meeting.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.625
It's still not possible.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.502
Nah, I think you're gonna
be able to find a way

40:21.544 --> 40:23.295
to make it work, especially
the hospital's been so generous

40:23.337 --> 40:26.048
in, uh, making your sister's
treatment possible.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.342
Excuse me?

40:29.301 --> 40:31.512
Melinda Strauss. Age 42.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.139
That's your sister, right?

40:33.180 --> 40:35.766
Coma patient.
She was in a car accident.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.518
Been here for
a couple of months.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.437
According to her file,

40:39.478 --> 40:42.815
she is receiving care
at a drastically reduced rate.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.483
The board approved that.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.776
She doesn't
have insurance, so...

40:45.818 --> 40:47.528
Which is why it would be sad

40:47.570 --> 40:48.904
if we had to kick her out.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.239
You can't do this.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.866
Of course, it may not be
a problem for you

40:51.907 --> 40:54.118
for too much longer.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.203
I mean, coma patients go

40:56.245 --> 40:59.665
into spontaneous respiratory
failure all the time.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.917
What do you want?

41:01.959 --> 41:04.753
My research trial starts Monday.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.715
Find the money.

41:17.349 --> 41:20.102
(birds singing)

41:26.108 --> 41:27.359
(sighs)

41:27.401 --> 41:28.777
My dad kicked me out.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.237
Can I crash
with you tonight?

41:30.279 --> 41:33.032
Unfortunately,
Alexis cut off my tab,

41:33.073 --> 41:35.117
and without the paycheck
from the photo shoot,

41:35.159 --> 41:37.328
I can't even afford
a crappy motel.

41:37.369 --> 41:40.247
So it looks like we're both
out of a place to sleep tonight.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.542
Who needs sleep?

41:45.377 --> 41:47.588
You do make a good point.
