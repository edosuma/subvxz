WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.317
Dad's on a Hunting trip,

00:02.318 --> 00:04.106
and he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:04.107 --> 00:05.373
We got work to do.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.444
That door is giving.
I can feel it giving.

00:15.185 --> 00:17.385
I know once you go Casper,
things can be a little --

00:17.387 --> 00:19.354
well, a lot crazy.

00:19.356 --> 00:21.690
You came out here
to see Mom?

00:21.692 --> 00:23.191
Winchester Surprise?

00:23.193 --> 00:24.526
I take all of that bologna,
all that sliced cheese,

00:24.528 --> 00:25.927
and I put it
onto a hot plate.

00:25.929 --> 00:27.429
Dad comes home,

00:27.431 --> 00:29.030
and he picks up everything,
chucks it in the trash.

00:29.032 --> 00:31.232
Probably reminded him
of you.

00:31.234 --> 00:33.301
Sam!

00:33.303 --> 00:34.302
It's a Ma'lak box.

00:34.304 --> 00:35.570
Secured and warded.

00:35.572 --> 00:37.739
Once inside...
nothing gets out.

00:39.409 --> 00:41.276
We're the guys
who save the world.

00:41.278 --> 00:44.546
We don't just
check out of it!

00:44.548 --> 00:45.747
Let's go home.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.734
Howdy, fellas.

01:05.736 --> 01:08.069
Anything on the shelves,
20% off.

01:08.071 --> 01:09.404
Today only.

01:09.406 --> 01:12.340
Great.
Well, actually, we are, uh --

01:12.342 --> 01:14.409
we're looking
for the good stuff.

01:14.411 --> 01:16.811
The really good stuff.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.655
Everything back here
is one of a kind.

01:27.657 --> 01:30.358
You got your basics --
hands of glory,

01:30.360 --> 01:36.097
your Gris-Gris bags,
your anointed dove's blood.

01:36.099 --> 01:38.767
And then...

01:38.769 --> 01:41.870
we have the more
premium items.

01:44.641 --> 01:46.608
You boys ever mess
with dragon's breath?

01:46.610 --> 01:48.443
Actually, we're, uh --
we're searching

01:48.445 --> 01:49.944
for something
pretty specific.

01:49.946 --> 01:51.279
How specific?

01:51.281 --> 01:53.848
The skull of Sarah Good.

01:53.850 --> 01:55.784
She was executed
during the Salem Witch Trial.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.486
Oh, I know who she was.

01:58.488 --> 02:00.722
And I think
I can help you.

02:07.297 --> 02:09.830
I wouldn't do that.

02:22.646 --> 02:23.978
I'll tell you what.

02:23.980 --> 02:25.680
I'll make you a deal.

02:25.682 --> 02:27.816
I got this for a song at
a flea market up in Pawtucket --

02:27.818 --> 02:29.417
No, you didn't.

02:31.688 --> 02:34.089
Belongs to Bart Kemp.

02:34.091 --> 02:36.991
See, he was a friend
of ours -- a Hunter.

02:36.993 --> 02:40.695
Worked out of Boston
up until last week.

02:40.697 --> 02:42.230
Somebody killed him --

02:42.232 --> 02:44.499
cut him clean in half.

02:44.501 --> 02:46.868
See, when they, uh,
found the body,

02:46.870 --> 02:48.336
his place
had been emptied out,

02:48.338 --> 02:50.205
but I guess you already knew
that, didn't you?

02:50.207 --> 02:51.506
Huh.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.880
Ohh!

02:58.882 --> 03:01.182
Now, this --
it's called Chrysaor.

03:01.184 --> 03:03.918
Supposed to be able
to cut through anything.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.621
Sliced up your pal real good
with just one swing,

03:06.623 --> 03:10.425
but you --
oh, you're a big boy.

03:10.427 --> 03:12.694
You might take some work.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.903
They always talk too much.

03:27.777 --> 03:30.211
Whoa.
Dean, according to this,

03:30.213 --> 03:33.414
he's got a ton
of occult objects here.

03:33.416 --> 03:35.717
What do you want to do
with all this crap?

03:35.719 --> 03:37.452
I don't know.

03:37.454 --> 03:39.787
I mean, I-I guess we, u,
take it home, right?

03:44.060 --> 03:45.293
Right, yeah.

03:45.295 --> 03:46.728
Good plan. Home.

03:46.730 --> 03:48.296
It's...

04:02.512 --> 04:06.014
All I know is I was standing
right here

04:06.016 --> 04:07.949
when I heard this -- bam!

04:07.951 --> 04:10.919
From the trunk
of their car.

04:10.921 --> 04:15.790
And then this, like,
shallow breathing.

04:17.761 --> 04:19.594
No way.

04:19.596 --> 04:22.130
Eliot,
you're creeping Max out.

04:22.132 --> 04:23.431
Yeah.

04:26.436 --> 04:27.969
That's them.

04:30.974 --> 04:34.175
So what -- you're saying
all this stuff is lethal?

04:34.177 --> 04:35.977
Yeah, it looks like.

04:41.351 --> 04:43.218
Hey.
The Campbell brothers.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.286
Lemme guess --
the usual?

04:45.288 --> 04:46.354
Make it a double.

04:49.292 --> 04:51.125
Dean, listen to this --

04:51.127 --> 04:55.496
uh, hangman's rope, fairy dust,
John Wayne Gacy's cigar box.

04:55.498 --> 04:57.966
So we're talkin', like,
31 Flavors of weird, huh?

04:57.968 --> 04:59.634
Pretty much, yeah.

04:59.636 --> 05:01.336
Listen, Jack and Cass
are out with Jules and her crew,

05:01.338 --> 05:02.537
but when they get back,
they can give us a hand

05:02.539 --> 05:03.805
cataloging
of all of this.

05:03.807 --> 05:05.473
Oh, cataloging, fun.

05:05.475 --> 05:07.041
Something like this --
maybe it's what we need,

05:07.043 --> 05:08.476
you know, to -- to...

05:08.478 --> 05:09.877
take your mind off things.

05:09.879 --> 05:11.980
Things? What things?

05:11.982 --> 05:14.882
Oh, you mean that thing that's
riding shotgun up in my head?

05:14.884 --> 05:16.517
That thing?

05:18.555 --> 05:19.921
I mean, think about it.

05:19.923 --> 05:21.389
Where did they
even come from?

05:21.391 --> 05:23.758
Them or their weird sidekick
with the trench coat.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.660
And what about that kid
with the dumb Bambi look

05:25.662 --> 05:26.661
on his face
all the time?

05:26.663 --> 05:28.429
So what?

05:28.431 --> 05:30.331
That doesn't mean that they
kidnapped Bigfoot or whatever.

05:31.935 --> 05:33.101
You guys are dicks.

05:34.738 --> 05:36.204
Gotta bounce.

05:36.206 --> 05:38.940
See you later?
At the thing?

05:38.942 --> 05:41.609
Sure, yeah.

05:41.611 --> 05:42.610
- Yeah.
- Us, too.

05:42.612 --> 05:44.279
- Bye.
- Later.

05:45.849 --> 05:49.751
Whatever their deal is,
they got an awesome car.

06:02.699 --> 06:05.967
You're not
gonna believe this.

06:05.969 --> 06:07.602
It's called the Baozhu.

06:07.604 --> 06:09.737
It's one of eight
ancient Chinese treasures.

06:09.739 --> 06:12.240
I-It's a pearl
that grants wishes.

06:12.242 --> 06:13.708
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

06:13.710 --> 06:15.476
Well, technically,
it's supposed to give you

06:15.478 --> 06:17.211
"what your heart desires."

06:17.213 --> 06:19.247
That would be Michael
outta my friggin' head.

06:19.249 --> 06:20.848
Exactly.

06:22.052 --> 06:23.618
So, you're telling me

06:23.620 --> 06:25.086
that the answer
to all of our problems

06:25.088 --> 06:27.288
is sitting right outside
in the ca--

06:32.162 --> 06:34.395
No, no, no, no, no!

06:34.397 --> 06:35.663
What the...

06:36.666 --> 06:38.166
Hey, hey, hey!

06:38.168 --> 06:40.601
Hey, hey!
Don't move!

06:40.603 --> 06:42.136
I didn't see anything,
I swear.

06:42.138 --> 06:43.604
Okay. Listen,
that car is dangerous, okay?

06:43.606 --> 06:45.173
Swear to God, if anything
happens to that car --

06:45.175 --> 06:46.641
Please,
I don't wanna die!

06:47.510 --> 06:49.811
Die? Why --
Why would you...

06:51.181 --> 06:54.182
Just tell us
what you saw.

06:54.184 --> 06:55.483
I don't wanna narc.

06:55.485 --> 06:58.252
You don't have a choice.

06:58.254 --> 07:00.688
Okay.
It's this girl Max.

07:00.690 --> 07:01.956
She's new in town,

07:01.958 --> 07:03.991
so I don't even know
where she lives.

07:05.762 --> 07:06.861
Don't.

07:13.036 --> 07:14.769
- Help you?
- I hope so.

07:14.771 --> 07:17.538
Um, I'm looking for a --
a local kid, a teenager --

07:17.540 --> 07:19.140
Max something.

07:19.142 --> 07:21.509
I feel bad.
I paid her to wash my car,

07:21.511 --> 07:23.010
but she took off
before I could tip her,

07:23.012 --> 07:24.212
and I figured you knew
everyone in town --

07:24.214 --> 07:25.446
So you want me to give you

07:25.448 --> 07:27.115
an underage girl's
address?

07:27.117 --> 07:28.716
No, uh --

07:28.718 --> 07:29.784
It's not like that.

07:29.786 --> 07:31.652
I...

07:31.654 --> 07:34.288
Marta.
How's that grandson of yours?

07:34.290 --> 07:38.693
Oh, he's a spoiled
little jerk, but I love him.

07:38.695 --> 07:41.462
'Course you do.

07:41.464 --> 07:42.864
Uh, listen,
my brother and I,

07:42.866 --> 07:45.299
we just need to talk
to this girl, okay?

07:45.301 --> 07:46.701
So, if you
could help us out,

07:46.703 --> 07:48.069
I would -- I would
really appreciate it.

07:48.071 --> 07:51.739
Oh, now, Dean,
I-I-I can't just go around

07:51.741 --> 07:54.008
handing out addresses
all willy nilly.

07:54.010 --> 07:56.811
I-I-I-I took a vow.

07:56.813 --> 07:58.346
Please.

08:00.483 --> 08:02.083
But, um...

08:07.891 --> 08:10.324
I can tell you
where to find her mother.

08:10.326 --> 08:11.559
Oh.

08:12.662 --> 08:14.095
All right.

08:20.437 --> 08:21.769
I'm gonna kill her.

08:21.771 --> 08:23.371
Does Max have a phone?

08:23.373 --> 08:25.506
O-Or do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

08:25.508 --> 08:27.608
She's supposed
to be in school.

08:27.610 --> 08:29.777
Skip day.

08:29.779 --> 08:31.012
What day?

08:31.014 --> 08:32.413
February 7th --
that's skip day.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.081
Kids ditch school.

08:34.082 --> 08:36.384
Some of them head out
to this old house on Route 36 --

08:36.385 --> 08:37.751
throw a party.

08:39.456 --> 08:40.888
It's a small town, man.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.690
Kids got to
blow off steam.

08:50.366 --> 08:51.866
What is all this stuff?

08:51.868 --> 08:53.701
Found it in the back
of the car.

08:55.138 --> 08:56.704
Ugh, creeeepy.

08:56.706 --> 08:58.639
No. It's awesome.

08:58.641 --> 09:00.441
Pizza's here.

09:00.443 --> 09:02.410
Oh, thank God.

09:02.412 --> 09:05.313
- Oh, I'm so excited for pizza.
- Me too.

09:05.315 --> 09:07.482
- I haven't eaten all morning.
- Oh, well,

09:07.484 --> 09:09.250
I haven't had pizza...

09:38.198 --> 09:39.765
Hey!
Th-- Those guys,

09:39.767 --> 09:41.166
they're after Max,
and they said something about --

09:41.168 --> 09:43.435
Dude, one --
you're not supposed to be here.

09:43.437 --> 09:45.270
Two -- chill.

09:45.272 --> 09:46.438
Max can handle herself.

10:27.347 --> 10:28.847
Oh, baby.

10:28.849 --> 10:30.515
Baby, baby, please tell me
you're not hurt.

10:34.188 --> 10:35.387
Dean.

10:35.389 --> 10:37.088
Back seat.

10:38.592 --> 10:39.758
It's empty.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.992
Ethan?

10:40.994 --> 10:42.327
Ethan, wait!

10:44.398 --> 10:45.864
Ethan, wait!

10:45.866 --> 10:46.998
- Wait, wait.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.166
What's going on?
What happened?

10:48.168 --> 10:49.668
He said he saw a ghost.

10:49.670 --> 10:51.837
It was a clown.
He said it tried to kill him!

10:53.373 --> 10:55.540
FBI!
Everybody out!

10:55.542 --> 10:57.742
Let's go!
Move, move!

10:59.613 --> 11:01.713
- Go!
- FBI?

11:01.715 --> 11:03.415
Hey, let's go.
Come on, huh?

11:06.220 --> 11:07.586
All right.

11:07.588 --> 11:09.921
Any of this stuff
scream "clown" to you?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.293
John Wayne Gacy's
cigar box.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.833
I mean...

11:23.036 --> 11:24.469
We should burn that
right now.

11:24.471 --> 11:26.538
Oh, yeah.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.440
A serial killer clown.

11:28.442 --> 11:29.741
I mean, this is, like,
the best/worst thing

11:29.743 --> 11:30.976
that's ever happened to you,
you know,

11:30.978 --> 11:32.043
'cause you love
serial killers,

11:32.045 --> 11:33.144
but --
but you hate clowns.

11:33.146 --> 11:34.813
Yeah, I get it, Dean.

11:34.815 --> 11:37.382
Yeah, just saying.

11:42.556 --> 11:43.788
Come on.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.324
Sam...today.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.066
Sam.

11:56.236 --> 11:57.335
Screw this.

11:57.337 --> 12:00.105
Eliot, no!

12:16.823 --> 12:19.624
Uh...

12:21.161 --> 12:23.628
Hey!

12:23.630 --> 12:24.829
That was a ghost.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.498
Yeah, yeah, okay, listen.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.999
I-I know you need --
or you want

12:28.001 --> 12:29.601
some sort
of rational explanation

12:29.603 --> 12:32.604
for what happened here,
but...

12:32.606 --> 12:33.872
there isn't one.

12:38.345 --> 12:41.313
My brother and I,
we hunt things.

12:41.315 --> 12:42.881
Evil things
that shouldn't exist.

12:42.883 --> 12:44.382
And we are damn good
at what we do.

12:44.384 --> 12:46.151
I knew it!

12:46.153 --> 12:49.154
Yeah, but if most people
out there knew the truth,

12:49.156 --> 12:51.156
if they knew
what was out there --

12:51.158 --> 12:53.158
They'd lose
their freaking minds.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.793
So what you saw here today,

12:54.795 --> 12:56.795
we're gonna keep that
our secret.

13:10.477 --> 13:12.177
Okay.

13:17.217 --> 13:18.650
John Wayne Gacy's ghost.

13:18.652 --> 13:21.052
Well, that's one
for the record books.

13:21.054 --> 13:22.554
Dean.

13:22.556 --> 13:23.888
Mm?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.657
I think this is it.

13:25.659 --> 13:27.993
- The pearl?
- Yeah.

13:27.995 --> 13:29.494
Let's do it.

13:29.496 --> 13:31.229
Are you -- Are you sure
you don't want to call Mom

13:31.231 --> 13:32.364
or -- or wait for Cass?

13:32.366 --> 13:34.532
No.
No, 'cause, you know,

13:34.534 --> 13:36.935
if this mojo works
like you say, great.

13:36.937 --> 13:39.437
If not...
why get their hopes up?

13:41.074 --> 13:42.173
Yeah.

13:42.175 --> 13:43.808
Okay.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.012
So, what do I...

13:47.014 --> 13:48.346
I don't know.

13:48.348 --> 13:49.848
I-I guess you --
you hold the pearl

13:49.850 --> 13:52.884
and -- and concentrate
on what your heart desires.

13:52.886 --> 13:54.319
Michael outta my head.

13:55.689 --> 13:57.555
Got it.

14:23.050 --> 14:25.550
Don't you move.

14:38.832 --> 14:39.831
Dad?

14:48.613 --> 14:50.412
Dean?

14:50.414 --> 14:53.015
Sam?

14:53.017 --> 14:54.283
What in the hell?

14:57.788 --> 15:00.022
Sammy.

15:00.024 --> 15:03.425
Aren't you supposed to be
in Palo Alto?

15:03.427 --> 15:04.460
Palo Alto?

15:07.098 --> 15:09.765
What happened to you?

15:09.767 --> 15:12.935
What year is it?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.939
It's 2003.

15:16.941 --> 15:19.808
It's 2019.

15:19.810 --> 15:21.143
No.

15:23.614 --> 15:25.981
How?

15:25.983 --> 15:27.816
We, uh...

15:27.818 --> 15:29.852
I-I think
we summoned you.

15:34.125 --> 15:37.526
You boys better tell me what
the hell is going on right now.

15:45.136 --> 15:48.737
So, you saved the world?

15:48.739 --> 15:50.973
More than once.

15:50.975 --> 15:52.841
Then it's all true.

15:52.843 --> 15:56.478
God, the Devil,
you boys smack in the middle.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.547
Now you live
in a secret bunker

15:58.549 --> 16:02.685
with an angel
and Lucifer's kid.

16:02.687 --> 16:04.420
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:05.690 --> 16:09.525
And you've done this whole
time-travel thing before?

16:09.527 --> 16:11.493
A few times.

16:11.495 --> 16:13.996
Actually, uh,
our grandfather,

16:13.998 --> 16:15.531
your dad --

16:15.533 --> 16:17.566
he's the one that helped us
find this place.

16:18.736 --> 16:22.871
I think he'd be real happy
to know you're finally here.

16:22.873 --> 16:25.007
Right. Man 'a Letters.

16:25.009 --> 16:26.208
Yeah.

16:26.210 --> 16:30.045
W-We're legacies...

16:30.047 --> 16:31.213
because of you.

16:38.689 --> 16:42.758
So, you've, um --
you've been busy.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.059
A little bit.

16:44.862 --> 16:46.362
I-I don't...

16:46.364 --> 16:48.564
I-I just...

16:50.234 --> 16:53.035
I just wish that I had
been there to see it.

16:56.574 --> 16:59.808
Dad, none of this would have
happened without you.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.644
It's good. It's fine.

17:02.646 --> 17:06.949
I-I went out takin' out
Yellow Eyes.

17:06.951 --> 17:09.550
I mean, that was the point,
right?

17:09.553 --> 17:12.721
I mean, get the thing
that killed Mom.

17:17.261 --> 17:19.728
Yeah, yeah, uh, Dad.

17:21.565 --> 17:22.931
About Mom...

17:22.933 --> 17:27.136
Sam? Dean?

17:27.137 --> 17:28.670
Mary?

17:57.268 --> 18:00.202
It's Dad.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.938
This is amazing, man.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm freaking out.

18:02.940 --> 18:06.375
Yeah, I know.
But, Dean -- Dean, listen.

18:06.377 --> 18:09.144
What? What?

18:09.146 --> 18:10.312
How did this happen?

18:10.314 --> 18:12.214
I-I-I don't know.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.982
You said that the --
the pearl gives you

18:13.984 --> 18:15.784
what your heart desires,
right?

18:15.786 --> 18:16.985
So, my heart desired --

18:16.987 --> 18:19.021
I --
I've wanted this, man.

18:19.023 --> 18:21.223
I've -- I've wanted this
since I was 4 years old.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.959
Okay, I know, and
I-I-I-I love this, too, Dean.

18:23.961 --> 18:27.129
I do, honestly, but --
but messing with time --

18:27.131 --> 18:28.564
No, no, no, Sam.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.199
You know how this ends.
Things change.

18:30.201 --> 18:31.733
Yeah, great -- we got
our family back together.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.502
I'll take that change.
That's not what I mean.

18:33.504 --> 18:35.304
Stop.
Just stop, okay?

18:35.306 --> 18:36.972
Look, can -- can we
just have one family dinner?

18:36.974 --> 18:38.173
Just one?

18:38.175 --> 18:41.143
Us -- all of us together.

18:41.145 --> 18:44.480
That's all I want.
Can you just give me that?

18:44.482 --> 18:46.381
Dean --

19:03.000 --> 19:07.236
This place --
I don't even know.

19:09.173 --> 19:10.539
Yeah, yeah.

19:10.541 --> 19:13.909
Uh, when we -- we, uh,
first moved in,

19:13.911 --> 19:16.378
I-I think it
kind of blew our minds, too.

19:19.717 --> 19:22.217
Um, where's --
where's Mom?

19:22.219 --> 19:24.553
Oh, she's, uh, gettin'
your brother a shopping list.

19:24.555 --> 19:27.022
She's gonna make that
casserole of hers.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.462
Yeah, Dean and I tried
to make that once.

19:38.035 --> 19:41.570
I, um...I remember.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.978
I screwed up with you a lot,
didn't I?

19:55.386 --> 19:56.418
No, that's okay.

19:56.420 --> 20:00.222
No, it's not.

20:00.224 --> 20:03.959
Sammy, tell me the truth.

20:03.961 --> 20:06.662
I don't want
to talk about that.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.930
You didn't have
a problem

20:07.932 --> 20:10.132
talking about it
before you left.

20:12.136 --> 20:13.835
Dad...

20:17.408 --> 20:18.640
...for me?

20:18.642 --> 20:20.442
That fight...

20:22.980 --> 20:26.348
...that was
a lifetime ago.

20:27.985 --> 20:30.852
I don't even remember
what I said, and --

20:34.592 --> 20:37.859
I mean...yeah.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.027
You know what?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.263
You did some
messed-up things.

20:44.001 --> 20:45.801
But I don't...

20:48.872 --> 20:51.873
I mean,
when I think about you...

20:55.179 --> 20:56.511
...and I think about you

20:56.513 --> 20:57.813
a lot...

20:59.650 --> 21:01.116
...I don't think about
our -- our fights.

21:03.854 --> 21:06.622
I think about you...

21:08.292 --> 21:12.194
I think about you
on the floor of that hospital.

21:15.165 --> 21:18.133
And I think about how
I never got to say goodbye.

21:26.677 --> 21:27.909
Sam.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.247
Son.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.349
I am so sorry.

21:39.890 --> 21:41.390
I'm sorry, too.

21:43.827 --> 21:45.327
But you did your best,
Dad.

21:45.329 --> 21:46.995
You --

21:46.997 --> 21:49.564
You fought for us,
and you loved us, and...

21:52.670 --> 21:54.503
...that's enough.

22:02.846 --> 22:04.413
Okay.

22:06.016 --> 22:07.883
Dean.
Hold on. Hold on.

22:07.885 --> 22:09.584
Just...

22:09.586 --> 22:12.220
What?

22:12.222 --> 22:15.724
Listen.
You, um...

22:18.896 --> 22:20.762
You're right.

22:24.068 --> 22:25.867
You want some company?

22:46.156 --> 22:47.589
All right.

22:47.591 --> 22:48.924
I'll get the booze --
you get the food.

22:51.662 --> 22:54.429
All right, Jackson.
It's celebration time.

22:54.431 --> 22:56.298
Give me your best stuff.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.967
Uh, do I know you?

22:58.969 --> 23:00.268
It's Dean.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.572
Campbell.

23:03.574 --> 23:05.974
I come in here,
like, always.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.445
Oh. Right.

23:10.447 --> 23:11.680
Right.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.154
Hey, Max.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.790
Weirdo.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.936
Hi.

23:59.062 --> 24:00.796
Dean.

24:00.798 --> 24:02.164
Dean, we have a problem.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.799
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

24:03.801 --> 24:05.167
Check this out.

24:05.169 --> 24:07.068
Is that me?

24:07.070 --> 24:11.206
According to the Internet, you
run a law firm and love kale.

24:11.208 --> 24:14.910
Wait till you check out your,
uh, wannabe TED Talk.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.680
<i>Invest in a treadmill desk,</i>
<i>don't drink coffee,</i>

24:18.682 --> 24:20.415
<i>and stick to</i>
<i>a raw food diet.</i>

24:20.417 --> 24:23.919
<i>I mean, God bless kale --</i>
<i>am I right?</i>

24:25.255 --> 24:26.521
<i>Truth is...</i>

24:26.523 --> 24:27.889
All right --
No, no, it gets worse.

24:27.891 --> 24:29.057
<i>...and this</i>
<i>is hard to hear --</i>

24:29.059 --> 24:30.525
<i>performing at your best</i>

24:30.527 --> 24:33.728
<i>requires all</i>
<i>of your mental energy.</i>

24:33.730 --> 24:35.530
<i>-Every last drop.</i>
-Okay.

24:35.532 --> 24:36.832
<i>You see,</i>
<i>it's just not compatible</i>

24:36.834 --> 24:39.501
<i>with something like,</i>
<i>uh...</i>

24:39.503 --> 24:43.071
<i>hobbies or, uh --</i>
<i>or even having a family.</i>

24:43.073 --> 24:44.439
Okay.
That's enough of that.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.208
Listen, Dean,
there is a wanted poster for you

24:46.210 --> 24:47.576
hanging in the post office.

24:47.578 --> 24:49.010
Oh, yeah, no,
I-I Googled me, as well.

24:49.012 --> 24:50.579
Um, lotta beheadings.

24:50.581 --> 24:52.247
I was right --

24:52.249 --> 24:54.349
messing with time
changed things.

24:54.351 --> 24:57.185
Well, I mean, I'm still hunting,
but you're Internet famous.

24:57.187 --> 24:59.888
So, what -- is there two of us
running around here?

24:59.890 --> 25:03.258
No, I don't think so.
I think it's a temporal paradox.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.260
We pulled Dad here
from 2003, right?

25:05.262 --> 25:06.761
So time
is self-correcting.

25:06.763 --> 25:09.364
Our timeline is changing
to this new one.

25:09.366 --> 25:10.866
So, what do you mean?

25:10.868 --> 25:13.902
It means, I think, that,
if we don't fix this,

25:13.904 --> 25:16.705
then we become those
other versions of ourselves.

25:16.707 --> 25:18.240
Like, for real.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.743
Okay, well, I'm cool,
but you're -- ugh.

25:21.745 --> 25:23.445
That's not the point.
The point is,

25:23.447 --> 25:27.549
if -- if all this is different,
then what else changed?

25:48.447 --> 25:52.716
Earth -- where you're always
stepping in something.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.385
Come on, Constantine.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.053
I don't understand
that reference.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.288
You wouldn't.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.827
How are we
gonna tell Dad?

26:03.829 --> 26:05.095
I don't know.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.631
How are we gonna tell Mom?

26:12.137 --> 26:14.938
It's been hard moving around,
but I'm happy.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.441
Can I help you?

26:18.443 --> 26:19.743
Bet you can.

26:19.745 --> 26:24.080
See, I need to know...

26:24.082 --> 26:26.483
who's been messing
with time.

26:26.485 --> 26:27.984
I'm sorry?

26:27.986 --> 26:29.586
Yeah, we sensed a --

26:29.588 --> 26:32.188
well, let's call it
a disturbance in the Force.

26:32.190 --> 26:33.823
And in Heaven, well,

26:33.825 --> 26:35.425
we're -- we're
not super fond of those.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.127
In Heaven?

26:37.129 --> 26:39.129
Yeah, yeah.
In Heaven.

26:41.366 --> 26:43.333
This town --

26:43.335 --> 26:46.336
it's always been
a little...muddy for us.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.739
Some sort of...interference.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.475
Hi.

26:54.346 --> 26:57.814
So, I'm going to ask
one more time --

26:57.816 --> 27:01.651
who's been playing
"Back to the Future"?

27:01.653 --> 27:05.055
And you're going to tell me,
or he --

27:05.057 --> 27:06.222
What's the phrase
I'm looking for?

27:06.224 --> 27:08.158
He -- oh --

27:08.160 --> 27:09.359
murders you all.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.730
My name is Castiel.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.465
I'm an angel of the Lord.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.709
Let's get out of here.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.677
What the hell?

27:40.158 --> 27:43.093
Get out. Go, go!
Go!

27:43.095 --> 27:44.794
The Winchesters?

27:46.331 --> 27:49.566
Zachariah?
Cass?

27:49.568 --> 27:52.669
Now, I-I-I know
we had big plans for you,

27:52.671 --> 27:56.673
and then your daddy just up
and disappeared, which...

27:56.675 --> 27:59.909
Oh. You.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.279
This is all you.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.751
Cass, you know us.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.018
I don't know you.

28:12.257 --> 28:13.923
Kill them.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.195
Cass, don't!

28:25.437 --> 28:27.070
What did you do, Sam?

28:35.380 --> 28:37.881
What did you do?

28:37.883 --> 28:39.382
Sam.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.085
Speak, Ubu, speak.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.888
What?

28:44.890 --> 28:47.056
What is it?

29:11.817 --> 29:13.116
Aah!

29:17.989 --> 29:19.823
Ohh!

29:23.528 --> 29:25.461
Ohh!

29:30.802 --> 29:32.936
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no!

29:36.842 --> 29:39.175
Cass.

29:39.177 --> 29:40.410
Cass.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.113
Stop it.

30:09.971 --> 30:12.071
A "temporal paradox"?

30:12.073 --> 30:15.207
That's what Sam's
calling it.

30:15.209 --> 30:17.710
Egghead.

30:17.712 --> 30:23.749
Basically, uh,
if you don't go back,

30:23.751 --> 30:25.751
Sam never gets
back into the life,

30:25.753 --> 30:29.889
um, and Mom, she, uh...

30:31.025 --> 30:32.692
What?

30:32.694 --> 30:35.094
Well, without everything
that we did --

30:35.096 --> 30:38.864
with God, The Darkness --

30:38.866 --> 30:40.132
she never comes back.

30:41.869 --> 30:44.537
Sam thinks that
she'll just fade away.

30:48.343 --> 30:50.509
Okay.

30:50.511 --> 30:53.012
I mean,
me versus your mom?

30:53.014 --> 30:56.115
That's -- That's
not even a choice.

30:59.854 --> 31:01.387
Does she know?

31:07.195 --> 31:09.128
How?

31:11.699 --> 31:14.233
Uh, the, uh...

31:14.235 --> 31:17.370
the lore is pretty clear.

31:17.372 --> 31:21.707
We destroy the pearl,
and it unwinds all of this.

31:21.709 --> 31:23.776
Dad goes back...

31:23.778 --> 31:25.911
and so will
everything else.

31:29.550 --> 31:31.951
And he won't
remember anything?

31:34.389 --> 31:36.322
No.

31:44.766 --> 31:45.931
Sam, I can't.

31:45.933 --> 31:48.167
I know.
I know, Mom.

31:59.914 --> 32:01.614
You want to give
your mom a hand?

32:01.616 --> 32:02.848
Yeah.

32:03.951 --> 32:05.785
Dean.

32:05.787 --> 32:10.423
I, uh --
I never meant for this.

32:10.425 --> 32:11.624
Dad, we pulled you here.

32:11.626 --> 32:14.193
No, son.

32:14.195 --> 32:16.462
My fight.

32:16.464 --> 32:21.133
It was supposed to end with me,
with Yellow Eyes.

32:21.135 --> 32:25.938
But now you --
you are a grown man,

32:25.940 --> 32:28.808
and I am incredibly
proud of you.

32:31.979 --> 32:33.846
I guess that I had hoped,
eventually,

32:33.848 --> 32:35.548
you would...

32:35.550 --> 32:39.885
get yourself a normal life,
a peaceful life, a family.

32:43.157 --> 32:44.990
I have a family.

32:47.695 --> 32:49.662
Yeah.

32:51.365 --> 32:53.499
All right.
What's next?

32:56.137 --> 32:57.470
We eat.

33:29.070 --> 33:30.836
All right.

33:30.838 --> 33:34.507
Near as I can tell,
we have two choices.

33:34.509 --> 33:37.676
All right, we can think
about what's coming.

33:37.678 --> 33:39.545
Or we can be grateful

33:39.547 --> 33:41.347
for this time
that we have together.

33:41.349 --> 33:43.949
Now, me...

33:43.951 --> 33:45.718
I choose grateful.

33:48.456 --> 33:53.225
So, to whatever
brought us together,

33:53.227 --> 33:55.594
we owe you one.

33:55.596 --> 33:57.730
Amen.

33:57.732 --> 33:59.031
Amen.

33:59.033 --> 34:00.900
Amen.

34:00.902 --> 34:02.468
Amen.

34:08.042 --> 34:09.574
Yeah!

34:57.625 --> 35:01.126
Did you see them at dinner,
way they looked at each other?

35:01.128 --> 35:04.163
They just seemed happy,
you know?

35:06.133 --> 35:08.434
It doesn't feel fair
to get all this

35:08.436 --> 35:11.103
and have to throw it away,
and I know we have to.

35:11.105 --> 35:13.105
But it just feels like,
you know...

35:15.109 --> 35:17.776
Once we send Dad back...

35:17.778 --> 35:19.111
it's like none of this
ever happened.

35:19.113 --> 35:23.115
He -- He just goes back
to -- to...

35:23.117 --> 35:25.284
to being Dad.

35:25.286 --> 35:27.786
You saying you wish things
would be different?

35:27.788 --> 35:29.855
Don't you?

35:29.857 --> 35:31.223
Can you imagine --

35:31.225 --> 35:32.958
Dad in the past,

35:32.960 --> 35:34.393
knowing then
what he knows now?

35:34.395 --> 35:36.562
I...

35:36.564 --> 35:38.397
I think
it would be nice.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.634
Yeah.

35:41.636 --> 35:43.769
I used to think that,
too.

35:45.506 --> 35:49.174
But, uh...

35:49.176 --> 35:50.976
I mean, look, we've been through
some tough times.

35:50.978 --> 35:52.311
There's no denying that.

35:52.313 --> 35:53.912
Yeah.

35:53.914 --> 35:56.181
And for the longest time,
I blamed Dad.

35:58.219 --> 35:59.918
I mean, hell,
I blamed Mom, too, you know?

35:59.920 --> 36:02.855
I was angry.

36:02.857 --> 36:07.192
But say we could send Dad back
knowing everything.

36:07.194 --> 36:09.528
Why stop there?

36:09.530 --> 36:12.398
Why not send him
even further back

36:12.400 --> 36:15.934
and let some other poor
sons of bitches save the world?

36:17.538 --> 36:19.872
But here's the problem.

36:19.874 --> 36:21.674
Who does that make us?

36:24.412 --> 36:25.844
Would we be better off?

36:25.846 --> 36:27.179
Well, maybe.

36:28.616 --> 36:30.082
But I got to be honest --

36:30.084 --> 36:32.284
I don't know who that
Dean Winchester is.

36:33.954 --> 36:37.389
And I'm good
with who I am.

36:37.391 --> 36:38.857
I'm good
with who you are.

36:42.196 --> 36:47.566
'Cause our lives --
they're ours.

36:47.568 --> 36:50.936
And maybe I'm just too damn old
to want to change that.

36:59.213 --> 37:02.481
I hate this.

37:02.483 --> 37:04.216
So do I.

37:11.559 --> 37:13.792
Okay.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.766
My girl.

37:25.172 --> 37:28.640
I miss you so damn much.

37:28.642 --> 37:30.109
Me too.

37:51.665 --> 37:52.965
You two.

37:55.436 --> 37:57.536
You take care
of each other.

37:58.939 --> 38:00.339
We always do.

38:03.277 --> 38:05.644
Good to see you, Dad.

38:05.646 --> 38:07.713
Yeah.

38:09.784 --> 38:12.785
I am so proud
of you boys.

38:30.237 --> 38:32.971
I love you both so much.

38:41.315 --> 38:44.349
I love you, too.

38:46.754 --> 38:48.420
Okay.

38:50.724 --> 38:53.158
Okay.

38:54.862 --> 38:56.895
I'm ready.

39:09.443 --> 39:11.510
Sammy.

40:15.509 --> 40:16.808
Monsters!

40:16.810 --> 40:19.444
Those guys
hunt monsters!

40:20.447 --> 40:22.281
That is so cool.

40:34.695 --> 40:37.462
Mary, Sam, Dean.

40:42.002 --> 40:43.435
What happened?

40:45.306 --> 40:47.139
What happened?

40:49.543 --> 40:51.376
Well, there's a story.

41:10.464 --> 41:12.064
Dean.

41:13.334 --> 41:14.733
No, I'm okay.

41:14.735 --> 41:16.568
I just...

41:16.570 --> 41:20.539
I just had
one hell of a dream.

41:20.541 --> 41:21.907
Yeah.

41:21.909 --> 41:24.476
No, it was a good one.

41:24.478 --> 41:26.511
I'm on my way back.

41:26.513 --> 41:28.380
I'll see you soon.
