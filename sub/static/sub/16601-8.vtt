WEBVTT

00:03.106 --> 00:05.608
Uh-huh, and when did you
stop eating meat?

00:05.610 --> 00:07.343
Uh, like, uh, yesterday.

00:07.345 --> 00:08.978
- Oh, really?
- Yup.

00:08.980 --> 00:10.679
Morning, Rakesh.

00:10.681 --> 00:12.815
Good morning!
Hey, Ashley.

00:12.817 --> 00:13.849
Is the mango juice back in?

00:13.851 --> 00:15.050
Where it usually is.

00:15.052 --> 00:16.852
Yes!

00:16.854 --> 00:17.853
What's with the mango juice?

00:17.855 --> 00:18.954
I just like it.

00:18.956 --> 00:20.356
Whatever happened
to apple juice?

00:20.358 --> 00:22.558
- That's for little kids.
- Oh, of course.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.261
Mango juice has lots of
vitamins. You should try it.

00:25.263 --> 00:28.097
Uh, coffee's got all the
vitamins I need in the morning.

00:28.099 --> 00:29.865
Hey!

00:29.867 --> 00:30.933
Come on, you know what this is.

00:30.935 --> 00:32.801
Give me the money.
- Okay.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.570
Give me the money!
Come on, now! Shut up!

00:34.572 --> 00:35.546
- Please, please?
-Shut up!

00:35.570 --> 00:36.740
Please, okay.

00:36.741 --> 00:38.007
Come on, let's go, man!

00:38.009 --> 00:39.441
Right now!
- I'm ope-opening.

00:39.443 --> 00:40.709
Don't be stupid! Let's go!

00:40.711 --> 00:42.244
Now! Shut up!
Calm down, okay.

00:42.246 --> 00:44.213
Come on! Hurry up!
Let's go!

00:44.215 --> 00:45.681
Do it! Hurry up!
- Okay.

00:45.683 --> 00:47.316
Open it now!

00:48.518 --> 00:49.852
No! Daddy!

00:49.854 --> 00:53.088
Man, what'd you do?!

00:53.090 --> 00:54.323
Don't move!

00:55.192 --> 00:56.425
What you standing around for?

00:56.427 --> 00:57.960
We got to go!

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.737 --> 01:10.606
Yeah. We have a man shot
in the bodega

01:10.608 --> 01:12.875
at the corner of Clarkson
and 83rd.

01:12.877 --> 01:15.344
Okay, so we work
the same M.O. as that one.

01:15.346 --> 01:17.313
Detectives, this
is Liza Daniels.

01:17.315 --> 01:19.215
She asked to
speak with you.

01:19.217 --> 01:20.316
Okay, make it quick.

01:20.318 --> 01:21.850
You know Emily Harrison?

01:21.852 --> 01:23.886
We're familiar
with her, yeah.

01:23.888 --> 01:25.254
Emily's a friend.

01:25.256 --> 01:27.990
At least she was until I started
dating her ex-boyfriend.

01:27.992 --> 01:30.326
- Brandon Mitchell?
- Emily said

01:30.328 --> 01:31.427
some horrible things about him.

01:31.429 --> 01:33.095
When I said
I didn't believe her,

01:33.097 --> 01:34.730
she said I should talk to you.

01:34.732 --> 01:36.932
He's not a good guy. You
should stay away from him.

01:36.934 --> 01:38.534
How about that?

01:38.536 --> 01:40.869
Why don't you take
a look at these?

01:40.871 --> 01:43.205
Go ahead.

01:48.878 --> 01:52.448
He handcuffed her,
then he beat her and raped her.

01:52.450 --> 01:55.351
Brandon couldn't have done that.

01:55.353 --> 01:57.353
- Why not?
- Because Brandon's not like that.

01:57.355 --> 01:59.622
And if he had done
that, he'd be in jail.

01:59.624 --> 02:01.223
Doesn't always work that way.

02:01.225 --> 02:03.792
Brandon's a great guy.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.127
Emily is my problem.

02:05.129 --> 02:06.562
How's that?

02:06.564 --> 02:07.963
She's calling me every day.

02:07.965 --> 02:10.699
She even came by my office
acting like a jealous psycho.

02:10.701 --> 02:14.169
Trust me, Emily does
not want Brandon back.

02:14.171 --> 02:17.139
Look... you guys know her.

02:17.141 --> 02:20.476
Sounds like she'll listen to
you, so do her a favor, please.

02:20.478 --> 02:22.444
Tell her that if she
doesn't back off,

02:22.446 --> 02:24.413
I'm gonna file a
harassment complaint.

02:32.255 --> 02:34.556
Super said there was a homeless
person living down here.

02:34.558 --> 02:35.557
Ooh.

02:36.794 --> 02:39.061
Wait. Hang on.

02:42.066 --> 02:43.599
Hold on.

02:46.803 --> 02:48.771
I'll pick up your dry cleaning.

02:48.773 --> 02:50.773
Um, you have

02:50.775 --> 02:53.142
lunch at Babbo at 12:30,

02:53.144 --> 02:55.077
and then meetings back to back

02:55.079 --> 02:56.679
before the Met reception.

02:56.681 --> 02:59.615
Got it.

02:59.617 --> 03:01.083
Yeah.

03:04.387 --> 03:05.220
What's your name?

03:05.222 --> 03:06.255
Tara Chandler.

03:06.257 --> 03:07.756
How long have you been
living here?

03:07.758 --> 03:09.091
Five days.

03:09.093 --> 03:10.659
I used to live upstairs in 12E,

03:10.661 --> 03:12.294
but my roommates
and I got evicted.

03:12.296 --> 03:12.958
Why?

03:12.982 --> 03:14.230
Seven of us living
in a two-bedroom.

03:14.231 --> 03:16.265
Only way we could
afford the place.

03:16.267 --> 03:18.801
How are you living here?

03:18.803 --> 03:20.369
Um,

03:20.371 --> 03:23.172
I still have
my laundry room key, and

03:23.174 --> 03:24.373
there's a shower in there.

03:24.375 --> 03:27.343
There's power.
I get cell reception.

03:27.345 --> 03:28.877
View kind of sucks, but...

03:28.879 --> 03:30.279
Sounds like
you still have a job.

03:30.281 --> 03:31.413
Why haven't you found
a new place?

03:31.415 --> 03:33.182
Manhattan rents are insane.

03:33.184 --> 03:34.149
What about your roommates?

03:34.151 --> 03:35.484
They're all moving to Queens.

03:35.486 --> 03:36.585
What's wrong with Queens?

03:36.587 --> 03:38.287
My boss is Camilla Lawson,

03:38.289 --> 03:40.589
the president of Chadway Dunce,
the publishing house.

03:40.591 --> 03:42.257
She's seriously
high maintenance.

03:42.259 --> 03:44.059
Insists her assistant
live in Manhattan

03:44.061 --> 03:46.995
and be on call 24-7
for $800 a week.

03:46.997 --> 03:48.931
Maybe you should find a new job.

03:48.933 --> 03:52.167
300 people applied for
this position, and 300 people

03:52.169 --> 03:53.802
are waiting if I mess up.
- Okay.

03:53.804 --> 03:55.070
Can't you crash
with family or friends

03:55.072 --> 03:56.271
till you find a new place?

03:56.273 --> 03:58.640
I just moved here
from Scranton nine months ago.

03:58.642 --> 04:01.043
I work all the time.
I don't have time for friends.

04:01.045 --> 04:03.612
Okay, we can see
you're in a tough spot, but...

04:03.614 --> 04:05.147
you're trespassing.

04:05.149 --> 04:06.749
So we can let you off

04:06.751 --> 04:09.218
with a warning today,
but you can't stay here.

04:09.220 --> 04:11.553
I understand. Thank you.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.989
I'll get all of my stuff
out of here right after work.

04:15.525 --> 04:18.560
If we can help with anything
else, give us a call.

04:20.363 --> 04:22.431
<i>And a big</i>

04:22.433 --> 04:25.267
thank you from the Chief
Constable of Scotland

04:25.269 --> 04:27.002
for showing him and
his people around.

04:27.004 --> 04:28.270
Don't remind me.

04:28.272 --> 04:30.172
What's the problem?
They said they learned a lot.

04:30.174 --> 04:31.373
Yeah, I learned something, too.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.841
Never drink with Scottish cops.

04:32.843 --> 04:34.009
We have

04:34.011 --> 04:36.078
a problem with
the bodega robbery in Brooklyn.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.913
Yeah, I got word
shopkeeper didn't make it.

04:37.915 --> 04:39.782
- Yeah.
- Yeah. There's more bad news.

04:39.784 --> 04:41.250
According
to the <i>Post</i> Web site,

04:41.252 --> 04:42.818
there was a customer
named James Reed

04:42.820 --> 04:44.620
in the shop at the
time of the shooting.

04:44.622 --> 04:46.355
And?

04:46.357 --> 04:48.690
Reed is a sergeant at the 3-6.

04:48.692 --> 04:50.225
He didn't lift a finger

04:50.227 --> 04:51.693
to help this guy.

04:51.695 --> 04:52.928
He failed to take any action?

04:52.930 --> 04:55.130
He called 911
after the perps fled.

04:55.132 --> 04:56.265
And he was he armed at the time?

04:56.267 --> 04:57.466
According to the <i>Post,</i>

04:57.468 --> 04:58.667
he was carrying
an off-duty revolver.

04:58.669 --> 05:00.035
And I assume they used

05:00.037 --> 05:01.737
their usual editorial restraint?

05:01.739 --> 05:04.206
"Coward Cop Ducks and Covers."

05:04.208 --> 05:06.542
Reed's C.O.

05:06.544 --> 05:08.177
says he wasn't alone
at the bodega.

05:08.179 --> 05:11.580
He was with
his ten-year-old daughter.

05:13.183 --> 05:15.918
That changes everything.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.753
Actually, it's neither
here nor there.

05:17.755 --> 05:18.821
What's that mean?

05:18.823 --> 05:20.989
It means it's not
as simple as that.

05:20.991 --> 05:23.826
Damn it!

05:23.828 --> 05:27.062
He was with his daughter,
and off-duty.

05:27.064 --> 05:29.431
And every cop takes an oath
to uphold the law.

05:29.433 --> 05:30.899
There's not a time clock on it.

05:30.901 --> 05:33.335
You don't punch out
from that commitment.

05:33.337 --> 05:34.770
It was Reed's duty to act,

05:34.772 --> 05:37.139
to somehow come to the aid
of that crime victim.

05:37.141 --> 05:39.575
Did the <i>Post</i> know,
or did they just leave it out?

05:39.577 --> 05:41.743
There's no headline
if you include the kid.

05:41.745 --> 05:43.679
Yeah.

05:43.681 --> 05:46.114
What do you want us to do, boss?

05:46.116 --> 05:47.883
What I want to do is

05:47.885 --> 05:50.385
make them have all the facts
before they print something.

05:50.387 --> 05:54.323
What I have to do,
now that it's out there?

05:54.325 --> 05:59.194
Tell his C.O. I want to see
Officer Reed up here forthwith.

As you were.

06:44.027 --> 06:45.960
Please sit down.

06:48.497 --> 06:52.467
I'm looking at your service
record, and I'm confused.

06:52.469 --> 06:53.968
- Sir?
- Well, your evaluations

06:53.970 --> 06:58.139
are excellent, decorated twice
for Meritorious Duty.

06:58.141 --> 07:01.442
By all measures, a cop's cop.
Try to be.

07:01.444 --> 07:04.379
So how could you stand down on
the scene of an armed robbery?

07:04.381 --> 07:06.214
I was with my daughter,
Commissioner.

07:06.216 --> 07:07.649
I'm aware of that.

07:07.651 --> 07:08.850
Tell me what happened.

07:08.852 --> 07:11.252
I was walking my daughter
Ashley to school.

07:11.254 --> 07:13.321
We stopped into
the local bodega.

07:13.323 --> 07:14.989
Next thing I know,

07:14.991 --> 07:18.192
two perps have guns on the
man behind the register.

07:18.194 --> 07:21.129
Not pros, either. Jumpy.

07:22.464 --> 07:23.598
Go on.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.134
Two instincts kicked in
at the same time.

07:26.136 --> 07:30.905
To do my job,
and to keep my little girl safe.

07:30.907 --> 07:33.441
The second one won out.

07:33.443 --> 07:35.476
The initial investigation
indicates

07:35.478 --> 07:38.379
you could have moved
your daughter out of harm's way

07:38.381 --> 07:40.114
and still discharged your duty.

07:40.116 --> 07:42.750
Maybe in a perfect scenario,
where she doesn't sound a peep,

07:42.752 --> 07:44.018
and we could move like

07:44.020 --> 07:45.219
we were invisible.

07:45.221 --> 07:46.788
So for lack
of a perfect scenario,

07:46.790 --> 07:49.057
you let a shopkeeper
take a bullet?

07:49.059 --> 07:50.825
Let him?

07:50.827 --> 07:52.360
No, sir, I didn't let him.

07:52.362 --> 07:54.195
Like I had a choice...

07:54.197 --> 07:55.630
Isn't that what happened?

07:55.632 --> 07:58.032
It kills me
that I couldn't help him.

07:58.034 --> 07:59.400
Couldn't or wouldn't?

08:00.436 --> 08:04.672
Look at me and answer
the question.

08:07.776 --> 08:09.711
Couldn't.

08:09.713 --> 08:13.114
I could not save him.

08:13.116 --> 08:15.850
I had a choice,
and a split second to make it,

08:15.852 --> 08:18.619
and I chose
to protect my little girl.

08:18.621 --> 08:21.656
Our officers are paid
to run <i>toward</i> danger,

08:21.658 --> 08:23.458
not turn away from it.

08:23.460 --> 08:26.394
I won't apologize
for what I did, sir.

08:26.396 --> 08:30.264
Given the same circumstances,
I'd do exactly the same thing.

08:30.266 --> 08:32.033
And so would I?

08:32.034 --> 08:33.967
- I didn't say that.
- But you're thinking it.

08:33.970 --> 08:36.871
I don't presume to know
what you think, sir.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.408
As of now,
you are on modified assignment.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.477
Should the investigators
determine

08:42.479 --> 08:44.545
that you are in violation
of your oath,

08:44.547 --> 08:48.349
you could face demotion
or lose your shield.

08:48.351 --> 08:51.552
That's the way this goes.

08:52.921 --> 08:55.223
That is all.

08:55.225 --> 08:57.425
Yes, sir.

09:23.886 --> 09:25.987
Tara?

09:25.989 --> 09:30.158
I-I'm so sorry to bother you,
but I am in huge trouble.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.092
What happened?

09:31.094 --> 09:32.260
I moved all my stuff

09:32.262 --> 09:33.761
to the alley
behind the building, but then,

09:33.763 --> 09:35.463
this big scary guy said
it was his spot,

09:35.465 --> 09:37.131
and he grabbed my laptop
and ran off...

09:37.133 --> 09:38.499
Oh, are you okay?

09:38.501 --> 09:40.501
Yeah, but my whole life
is on that computer.

09:40.503 --> 09:42.537
If I don't get it back,
I'm gonna get fired.

09:42.539 --> 09:44.238
Okay, calm down.
We're gonna take a ride,

09:44.240 --> 09:46.174
we're gonna see
if we can find this guy.

09:46.176 --> 09:48.109
Thank you so much.

09:48.111 --> 09:50.878
Wait. You really need
to find a safe place to live.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.281
I know. I-I will.

09:53.283 --> 09:54.916
Let's go.

09:54.918 --> 09:56.184
Hi, Camilla.

09:56.186 --> 09:58.452
Yes, your shoes are
in the shelf in your closet.

10:01.323 --> 10:02.523
I understand, but we're
not saying you did

10:02.525 --> 10:03.991
anything wrong, Emily.
I was just

10:03.993 --> 10:06.260
trying to make Liza understand
what Brandon's capable of.

10:06.262 --> 10:07.595
She just doesn't
want to hear it.

10:07.597 --> 10:09.530
Well, that's 'cause she thinks
she's in love with him.

10:09.532 --> 10:12.533
Which is unfortunate, but if
she wants to see this dirt bag,

10:12.535 --> 10:14.769
there's nothing you
or us can do about it.

10:14.771 --> 10:15.870
It's her choice.

10:15.872 --> 10:17.405
Brandon's a rapist.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.373
He raped me.

10:19.375 --> 10:22.844
We're not trying to minimize
what happened here, Emily.

10:22.846 --> 10:25.580
Look, I know I can't change
what Brandon did to me,

10:25.582 --> 10:26.948
but there is no way
I'm gonna sit on my hands

10:26.950 --> 10:28.115
while he does it
to someone else.

10:28.117 --> 10:30.685
Liza has already said
you harassed her.

10:30.687 --> 10:32.620
She wants to file
a complaint against you.

10:32.622 --> 10:33.788
You see what you're doing?

10:33.790 --> 10:35.923
You're making yourself out
to be the bad guy here.

10:35.925 --> 10:37.558
We cannot

10:37.560 --> 10:40.061
go after somebody
before they commit a crime.

10:40.063 --> 10:42.096
We can't prove
what he did to you,

10:42.098 --> 10:44.732
so, technically, Brandon hasn't
done anything wrong.

10:44.734 --> 10:46.567
Yet.

10:46.569 --> 10:47.735
I'll tell you what we'll do.

10:47.737 --> 10:51.639
We can have a patrol unit
sit in front of his place,

10:51.641 --> 10:53.307
keep an eye on him.

10:53.309 --> 10:54.976
Would that make you
feel better?

10:54.978 --> 10:56.244
You know that's not enough.

10:56.246 --> 10:58.613
We're trying
to help you here, Emily.

10:58.615 --> 11:00.147
Look, it's the best we can do.

11:08.156 --> 11:10.124
<i>I can't thank you guys enough.</i>

11:10.126 --> 11:11.792
You literally
saved my life.

11:11.794 --> 11:13.327
Hey, we're glad it worked out.

11:13.329 --> 11:15.529
You have yourself
a good night, all right, Tara?

11:15.531 --> 11:16.898
Good night.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.399
Tara, where you headed?

11:18.401 --> 11:19.533
There's a...

11:19.535 --> 11:21.235
24-hour diner near work.

11:21.237 --> 11:23.771
You know, I have manuscripts
to read anyway, so...

11:23.773 --> 11:26.641
Look, let me give you
some money for a hotel room.

11:26.643 --> 11:28.242
That's totally sweet,

11:28.244 --> 11:29.944
but I can't do that.

11:31.580 --> 11:33.281
Do me a favor--
hang on a sec?

11:33.283 --> 11:34.283
Sure.

11:35.517 --> 11:37.752
Hey...

11:37.754 --> 11:39.787
we should help this girl.

11:39.789 --> 11:41.923
We got her computer back.

11:41.925 --> 11:42.990
We can't send her out there

11:42.992 --> 11:44.225
with no place to stay.
If she won't

11:44.227 --> 11:47.361
take money for a hotel,
what are we supposed to do?

11:49.364 --> 11:51.966
I was thinking maybe
she could crash at your place

11:51.968 --> 11:53.401
for a couple days.

11:53.403 --> 11:55.403
Hmm?
She's a nice kid, Eddie.

11:55.405 --> 11:57.104
She'll find a place of her own
soon enough.

11:57.106 --> 11:59.173
Well, I am not taking
some stranger into my apartment.

11:59.175 --> 12:01.142
Why don't we just take her
to a shelter?

12:01.144 --> 12:04.312
You've been in those places.
Come on.

12:04.314 --> 12:06.047
She's not a stray puppy, Jamie.

12:06.049 --> 12:08.115
This job is hard enough
without taking it home

12:08.117 --> 12:10.117
with me literally.

12:10.119 --> 12:12.787
I'm gonna finish
the paperwork.

12:17.926 --> 12:20.494
I'm just saying, why
not go talk to the guy?

12:20.496 --> 12:22.229
Remind him that
we're watching him.

12:22.231 --> 12:23.798
We can't get
in Brandon Mitchell's grill

12:23.800 --> 12:25.633
if he hasn't done
anything wrong.

12:25.635 --> 12:27.034
He's done plenty wrong.

12:27.036 --> 12:28.602
Not to Liza Daniels.

12:28.604 --> 12:30.338
I don't get it with you.

12:30.340 --> 12:32.073
You were mad at me when I didn't
want to go after the guy;

12:32.075 --> 12:34.542
now I want to go after him,
and you don't want to.

12:34.544 --> 12:36.644
We start hassling Brandon,

12:36.646 --> 12:38.746
his fancy lawyer,
and next thing you know

12:38.748 --> 12:40.448
we'll be looking
at a harassment beef.

12:40.450 --> 12:41.682
5-4 Frank.

12:41.684 --> 12:43.617
You have a 10-10.
Possible shots fired

12:43.619 --> 12:45.052
at 313 Macdougall.

12:45.054 --> 12:48.055
Ambulance en route.
313 Macdougall.

12:48.057 --> 12:50.157
That's Brandon Mitchell's place.

12:59.202 --> 13:00.801
Make a hole.

13:00.803 --> 13:02.636
Hey! Make a hole.

13:02.638 --> 13:04.372
Step aside.

13:06.508 --> 13:08.709
Where we going?

13:18.920 --> 13:20.521
Liza Daniels?

13:20.523 --> 13:21.455
No.

13:21.457 --> 13:23.090
What do you mean, no?

13:24.226 --> 13:27.061
It's Brandon Mitchell.
He took two gunshots

13:27.063 --> 13:30.097
to the chest-- girl said
the shooter fled the scene.

13:32.934 --> 13:34.769
Where is she?
Where-where's the girl?

13:34.771 --> 13:36.337
Over there.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.475
You okay?

13:42.778 --> 13:44.245
What happened?

13:44.247 --> 13:46.313
We were upstairs.

13:46.315 --> 13:48.015
The doorbell rang.

13:48.017 --> 13:50.985
Brandon came down
to see who it was.

13:50.987 --> 13:53.220
Th-The next thing I know,
I heard gunshots.

13:53.222 --> 13:56.557
When I got down here,
Brandon was lying on the ground.

13:56.559 --> 13:58.459
There was blood everywhere,

13:58.461 --> 13:59.994
and he wasn't
b-breathing.

13:59.996 --> 14:02.063
Okay, did you get
a look at the shooter?

14:02.065 --> 14:04.331
No. The door was open.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.900
Sh-She must have
taken off.

14:05.902 --> 14:07.401
What do you mean, "she"?

14:07.403 --> 14:08.936
Emily Harrison.

14:08.938 --> 14:10.438
I thought

14:10.440 --> 14:12.406
you said you didn't see
who shot Brandon.

14:12.408 --> 14:14.108
I didn't have to.

14:14.110 --> 14:16.677
Emily wanted Brandon dead.

14:16.679 --> 14:19.413
She's the only one
who could've done this.

14:50.326 --> 14:51.592
Hey.

14:51.594 --> 14:53.427
- Hey.
- What's going on?

14:53.429 --> 14:55.195
Uh...

14:55.997 --> 14:57.931
Uh...

14:59.667 --> 15:01.035
I got to apologize.

15:01.037 --> 15:03.404
You were just trying to
help that girl, and...

15:03.406 --> 15:05.839
You know, I didn't feel
comfortable taking her in.

15:05.841 --> 15:08.208
- I get it. It's no big deal.
- Yeah?

15:08.210 --> 15:09.443
Yeah. I got it covered.

15:09.445 --> 15:11.612
Hey, Jamie, mind if
I grab a towel...

15:11.614 --> 15:12.813
Hey.

15:12.815 --> 15:14.314
Officer Janko.

15:14.316 --> 15:15.682
Hey, Tara.

15:15.684 --> 15:18.352
Fancy meeting you here.

15:18.354 --> 15:19.853
Yeah.

15:19.855 --> 15:22.322
Jamie invited me to crash
here for a little while.

15:22.324 --> 15:23.624
Oh.

15:23.626 --> 15:25.959
Just till she finds
her own place.

15:25.961 --> 15:28.128
Isn't he awesome?

15:28.130 --> 15:29.329
Oh-ho-ho,

15:29.331 --> 15:31.165
he is <i>awesome.</i>

15:32.368 --> 15:34.334
But don't you need
to be in Manhattan?

15:34.336 --> 15:36.737
And last time I checked,
this was Brooklyn Heights.

15:36.739 --> 15:39.406
Oh, uh, I can make it
work for a few days.

15:42.444 --> 15:44.111
I'm gonna grab
a shower.

15:44.113 --> 15:45.679
It was great to see you.

15:47.383 --> 15:49.016
Hmm.

15:50.618 --> 15:52.753
Well...

15:52.755 --> 15:54.254
Hmm, look at that,

15:54.256 --> 15:56.657
I came over to apologize
for leaving Tara hanging,

15:56.659 --> 15:59.293
and it looks like she
landed on her feet.

15:59.295 --> 16:01.361
It's no big deal, Eddie.
Oh, no, it kind of is.

16:01.363 --> 16:02.930
It's also very unprofessional.

16:02.932 --> 16:04.164
Hey, there's
no regulation against me

16:04.166 --> 16:05.632
helping somebody out
on my own time.

16:05.634 --> 16:07.067
Helping her or helping you?

16:07.069 --> 16:08.735
What's that supposed to mean?

16:08.737 --> 16:11.171
It means that if we had found
a smelly old homeless dude

16:11.173 --> 16:13.373
in that garage, do you really
think he'd be freshening up

16:13.375 --> 16:14.908
in your bathroom right now?
Do you

16:14.910 --> 16:16.477
seriously think
I would do something like that?

16:16.479 --> 16:19.179
No. Of course not. I'm sorry.

16:19.181 --> 16:21.715
I forgot-- you're <i>awesome.</i>

16:24.920 --> 16:28.155
♪

16:39.868 --> 16:42.069
Glad you called, Emily.

You know, I never thought
I'd be a fugitive.

16:45.508 --> 16:46.807
Where you been?

16:46.809 --> 16:48.142
Walking, mostly.

16:48.144 --> 16:50.277
Hung out at Grand Central
for a while.

16:50.279 --> 16:52.045
Surprised you didn't try
to catch a train home.

16:52.047 --> 16:53.547
I thought about it,

16:53.549 --> 16:56.583
but I figured you'd have police
looking for me up there, too.

16:57.519 --> 16:59.586
That's some good figuring.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.161
You bought a gun
a couple of weeks ago--

17:07.163 --> 17:08.829
you still got it?

17:10.464 --> 17:11.964
Okay.

17:11.967 --> 17:14.768
I'm gonna need you
to give it to me.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.412
Okay.

17:25.414 --> 17:26.646
Let's put it

17:26.648 --> 17:28.281
right on the bench.

17:33.054 --> 17:35.322
I'm gonna have to read you
your rights now.

17:35.324 --> 17:36.790
You have the right

17:36.792 --> 17:38.892
to remain silent

17:42.264 --> 17:43.964
Can I just tell you
what happened?

17:43.966 --> 17:45.632
You have the right
to consult an attorney

17:45.634 --> 17:47.568
before speaking to the police...

17:48.469 --> 17:50.470
...and to have
an attorney present

17:50.472 --> 17:51.972
during any questioning.

17:51.974 --> 17:53.330
Please, I just
need to tell you.

17:53.354 --> 17:53.975
If you cannot

17:53.976 --> 17:58.212
afford an attorney, one will be
provided for you without cost.

18:01.550 --> 18:04.851
the rights...
that I just read to you?

18:04.853 --> 18:07.321
Yes. But I need you to know
that I didn't plan

18:07.323 --> 18:08.722
on shooting Brandon.
- Emily,

stop talking.

Please.

I need you to do right now.

19:07.249 --> 19:08.715
at a known drug location.

21:26.855 --> 21:28.822
Ashley.

21:28.824 --> 21:31.658
I'm glad your dad's
gonna be okay.

21:31.660 --> 21:33.627
So you're my dad's boss?

21:33.629 --> 21:34.895
Yes.

21:34.897 --> 21:36.596
Did you call him a coward?

21:37.999 --> 21:39.399
No.

21:39.401 --> 21:41.168
Ashley!

21:42.203 --> 21:45.939
Ashley, I would never call
your father a coward.

21:45.941 --> 21:48.975
Just to let you know,
my dad's really brave.

21:48.977 --> 21:50.510
And a good man!

21:50.512 --> 21:54.181
Call him anything else,
it's just wrong.

22:10.576 --> 22:14.888
I understand your client intends
to plead not guilty, Mr. Gallo?

22:14.988 --> 22:17.822
That's right, though we're
willing to discuss a plea.

22:17.824 --> 22:20.391
Are you aware that the bullets
that killed Mr. Mitchell

22:20.393 --> 22:21.726
are a positive
ballistic match

22:21.728 --> 22:23.361
to Ms. Harrison's gun?

22:23.363 --> 22:24.662
We are.

22:24.664 --> 22:27.999
And you admit
that you shot Mr. Mitchell?

22:28.001 --> 22:29.133
Yes.

22:29.135 --> 22:31.235
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

22:31.918 --> 22:34.651
I went to Brandon's brownstone
to try to talk to him.

22:34.652 --> 22:37.586
And you had no prior intention
to harm Mr. Mitchell.

22:37.588 --> 22:38.954
No.

22:38.956 --> 22:40.089
Then why did you bring a gun,

22:40.091 --> 22:41.557
which you had no permit
to carry.

22:41.559 --> 22:43.959
You're aware of the prior
history here, Ms. Reagan.

22:43.961 --> 22:46.629
Are you aware those allegations
were never proven?

22:48.064 --> 22:52.568
I didn't know how Brandon would
react when I confronted him.

22:52.570 --> 22:55.437
But I was right to be worried.

22:55.439 --> 22:57.439
When I asked him

22:57.441 --> 23:01.410
to stop seeing Liza,

23:01.412 --> 23:04.113
he got angry.

23:05.282 --> 23:07.950
And he put his hand
around my throat,

23:09.052 --> 23:10.686
and he shoved me up against
the wall.

23:10.688 --> 23:12.121
So I reached into my bag

23:12.123 --> 23:16.392
and I grabbed my gun
and I shot him.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.294
So you're claiming self-defense.

23:18.296 --> 23:19.628
Bingo.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.363
No witnesses... you have
any visible bruising

23:21.365 --> 23:23.098
from this alleged attack?

23:25.202 --> 23:27.403
No.

23:28.705 --> 23:32.074
But I swear to you, Ms. Reagan,

23:32.076 --> 23:35.978
I'm telling you the truth.

23:41.085 --> 23:42.685
You wanted to see me, Monica?

23:42.687 --> 23:44.887
Come in, Erin.

23:44.889 --> 23:46.255
I understand you met

23:46.257 --> 23:47.923
with Emily Harrison
and her attorney?

23:47.925 --> 23:49.291
- I did.
- As you know,

23:49.293 --> 23:51.360
the victim's father
is a prominent member

23:51.362 --> 23:52.695
of the financial community,

23:52.697 --> 23:55.898
which makes this a
high-profile prosecution.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.000
I understand.
What was the substance

23:58.002 --> 23:59.501
of your meeting?

23:59.503 --> 24:01.003
Emily's claiming
self-defense.

24:01.005 --> 24:02.571
She's asserting Mitchell
attacked her

24:02.573 --> 24:04.840
when she showed up at his place
with a gun?

24:04.842 --> 24:06.875
Can't really blame him.
She's saying

24:06.877 --> 24:09.511
that she went there to talk,
he attacked her,

24:09.513 --> 24:11.180
she took out the gun, fired.

24:11.182 --> 24:14.783
Which no one can corroborate
except the victim, correct?

24:14.785 --> 24:16.018
That's correct.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.554
Defense counsel is open
to a plea.

24:18.556 --> 24:19.688
I bet he is.

24:19.690 --> 24:21.690
Bruno Gallo's a hack.

24:21.692 --> 24:24.960
I doubt he's ever
tried a murder case.

24:27.430 --> 24:29.665
She works an entry level job

24:29.667 --> 24:31.200
at an ad agency.

24:31.202 --> 24:32.401
Both her parents are teachers.

24:32.403 --> 24:33.769
He's the best they can afford.

24:33.771 --> 24:36.472
Well, then,
this shouldn't take too long.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.941
Well, given the history
between Emily

24:38.943 --> 24:41.310
and the victim...
That rape allegation...

24:41.312 --> 24:42.945
is unproven.

24:43.747 --> 24:45.281
The accused

24:45.283 --> 24:48.617
recently expressed a grudge
against Brandon Mitchell...

24:48.619 --> 24:50.853
to NYPD detectives no less.

24:50.855 --> 24:54.590
Then brought a concealed weapon
to his residence and killed him.

24:55.725 --> 24:58.294
This is a slam dunk, Erin.

24:58.296 --> 25:02.331
I don't usually talk strategy
with the Chief Assistant DA.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.133
Is there something else
I should know?

25:04.135 --> 25:08.070
As I said,
this is a high-profile case.

25:08.072 --> 25:10.506
The District Attorney
feels the facts warrant

25:10.508 --> 25:12.675
a vigorous prosecution.
- I don't think

25:12.677 --> 25:14.910
the maximum sentence
is warranted in this case.

25:14.912 --> 25:16.912
If she acted in self-defense,

25:16.914 --> 25:19.081
let her lawyer prove it
in court.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.215
I'm just not sure
he's up for it.

25:20.217 --> 25:21.750
Thanks for coming up, Erin.

25:21.752 --> 25:23.118
Keep me posted.

25:26.056 --> 25:28.324
♪

25:35.832 --> 25:39.234
We gonna talk
about this or what?

25:39.236 --> 25:41.637
I'm gonna go
with "or what."

25:41.639 --> 25:43.872
I'm helping someone in trouble;
there's nothing wrong with that.

25:43.874 --> 25:45.074
Okay.

25:45.076 --> 25:47.009
Let's say the bosses find out

25:47.011 --> 25:49.345
that you took this girl in
after meeting her on the job.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.846
After we tossed her
for trespassing,

25:50.848 --> 25:53.649
you don't think that they'd
question your judgment?

25:53.651 --> 25:55.351
No one's gonna
find out, Eddie.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.686
What if something
happened to Tara?

25:57.688 --> 26:01.423
It's possible, given
the crazy risks she takes.

26:01.425 --> 26:03.959
If it came out she
was staying with you,

26:03.961 --> 26:05.761
you could get jammed up.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.664
That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

26:08.666 --> 26:10.899
What?

26:10.901 --> 26:13.035
Isn't Jamie awesome?

26:13.037 --> 26:14.236
You know, what is with you?
You're acting like

26:14.238 --> 26:15.304
you're jealous or something.

26:15.306 --> 26:16.572
Oh, please.

26:16.574 --> 26:18.040
Don't flatter yourself.

26:18.042 --> 26:21.477
I'm trying to keep you from
screwing up your career.

26:21.479 --> 26:23.045
And mine.

26:26.049 --> 26:28.951
But he's going to be okay,
right?

26:28.953 --> 26:30.986
I think the gunshot's
gonna heal faster

26:30.988 --> 26:32.821
than the wound to his pride.

26:32.823 --> 26:35.290
Well, he's a far sight better
off than that bodega owner.

26:35.292 --> 26:37.760
You say that like Reed's got
blood on his hands.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.328
I make it sound like that
because he does.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.629
Come on, Pop.
Really?

26:40.631 --> 26:42.531
Every officer
who takes that oath

26:42.533 --> 26:45.267
is aware that he or she
is required to take action

26:45.269 --> 26:46.969
if witnessing a crime.

26:46.971 --> 26:48.237
But he was off duty.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.938
And he had his kid with him,
right?

26:49.940 --> 26:53.342
Both. And if there were
a natural human reflex,

26:53.344 --> 26:55.043
to run toward the fire,

26:55.045 --> 26:58.247
there wouldn't be language
that requires that response.

26:58.249 --> 27:00.382
But there isn't, so there is.

27:00.384 --> 27:03.152
But he did take action;
he called 911.

27:03.154 --> 27:05.320
That was after the bad guys
took off.

27:05.322 --> 27:06.755
That's a little late then, pal.

27:06.757 --> 27:07.856
Yeah, but it's crazy. I mean,

27:07.858 --> 27:09.725
is there any other job
that requires you

27:09.727 --> 27:11.393
to be on duty 24/7?

27:11.395 --> 27:13.429
Doctors and nurses
are asked to save lives

27:13.431 --> 27:14.630
when they're off duty.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.298
There's no binding
obligation to do so.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.634
- Hippocratic Oath says you do.
- Exactly.

27:18.636 --> 27:22.337
I hear he was a good cop,
and a good boss.

27:22.339 --> 27:24.139
And I hear the bodega owner

27:24.141 --> 27:27.810
was a well-liked and respected
neighbor of that community.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.378
Yeah, but Reed was with
his ten-year-old daughter.

27:29.380 --> 27:32.147
And the victim had family, too--
We could play this all day.

27:32.149 --> 27:35.884
But at this table, we always say
family comes first.

27:37.754 --> 27:40.355
In my book,
he did the right thing.

27:40.357 --> 27:43.258
Yes, it's a tragedy, he couldn't
protect the bodega owner,

27:43.260 --> 27:44.927
but he deserves credit
for protecting his daughter.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.195
Could have been a lot worse.

27:46.197 --> 27:47.129
What about you, Dad?

27:47.131 --> 27:48.730
I can't speak for myself.

27:48.732 --> 27:50.199
Hell just froze over.

27:50.201 --> 27:53.068
I'm dead serious;
I'm the guy who is charged with

27:53.070 --> 27:54.736
making certain
that every man and woman

27:54.738 --> 27:57.372
who takes that oath
upholds that oath.

27:57.374 --> 27:58.740
Okay, but just here, now.

27:58.742 --> 28:01.009
You have to understand,
I can't interpret it.

28:01.011 --> 28:03.612
I can't update it,
I can't massage it,

28:03.614 --> 28:07.850
I can't express or consider
any other way to look at this.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.818
That's who I am in this.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.620
Must have been a long week.

28:11.622 --> 28:14.590
For me, for Sergeant Reed,

28:14.592 --> 28:19.461
and most expressly,
for the victim and his family.

28:19.463 --> 28:20.729
It's a tough call.

28:20.731 --> 28:22.231
Yeah.

28:22.233 --> 28:23.866
But everyone who
takes that oath

28:23.868 --> 28:25.868
understands the commitment
they're making.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.103
Kind of like prosecutors
have a commitment

28:28.105 --> 28:29.738
to uphold justice.

28:29.740 --> 28:30.906
That's right.

28:30.908 --> 28:33.075
And you think charging
Emily Harrison

28:33.077 --> 28:34.743
with murder qualifies?

28:34.745 --> 28:37.379
Given the available evidence,
yes, I do.

28:37.381 --> 28:39.481
Despite all the
horrific things

28:39.483 --> 28:41.450
that that animal Brandon
Mitchell did to her.

28:41.452 --> 28:43.452
Revenge isn't a defense
for murder, Danny.

28:43.454 --> 28:44.853
Thank you.

28:44.855 --> 28:48.056
In light of the facts,
a murder charge is warranted.

28:48.058 --> 28:50.092
I don't have to like it
and neither do you.

28:50.094 --> 28:51.760
Amazing how you let Mitchell

28:51.762 --> 28:53.829
just walk free,
but Emily Harrison,

28:53.831 --> 28:55.364
you come at her
with both guns a-blazin'.

28:55.366 --> 28:57.633
Yeah, that's right,
because the facts demand it.

28:57.635 --> 29:00.636
The facts are that I didn't want
anything to do with this case,

29:00.638 --> 29:03.405
and you pressured me
into doing it.

29:03.407 --> 29:05.207
You pressured me into
taking this case,

29:05.209 --> 29:06.708
because Emily deserved justice.

29:06.710 --> 29:08.210
And now you just
walk away from it,

29:08.212 --> 29:10.279
and turn your back on her--
where's the justice in that?

29:10.281 --> 29:12.981
I asked for help
for a rape victim,

29:12.983 --> 29:14.516
not a murder suspect.

29:14.518 --> 29:17.085
She's a murder suspect
because she's a rape victim.

29:17.087 --> 29:18.587
Bottom line is if she gets life,

29:18.589 --> 29:20.689
it's because she took
someone else's.

29:20.691 --> 29:22.658
Let's keep it civil.

29:29.867 --> 29:34.303
The law may say that Emily
should be charged with murder,

29:34.305 --> 29:36.038
but that sure as hell
ain't justice.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.673
And that's the bottom line.

29:44.581 --> 29:46.848
♪

29:53.456 --> 29:56.558
You know why you and Danny
are going at it?

29:56.560 --> 29:59.628
Yeah, he's
being a jerk.

29:59.630 --> 30:01.697
He blames himself.

30:01.699 --> 30:04.800
And you blame yourself
for the same thing.

30:04.802 --> 30:06.702
We're lousy at sharing?

30:06.704 --> 30:08.003
Always were.

30:08.005 --> 30:10.672
The blame?
- In this case, yes.

30:10.674 --> 30:13.775
He feels responsible
for Ms. Harrison's situation,

30:13.777 --> 30:15.344
and so do you.

30:15.346 --> 30:16.745
No I don't.

30:16.747 --> 30:18.780
Not even a little?

30:18.782 --> 30:21.650
Vigilante justice isn't justice,
it's anarchy.

30:21.652 --> 30:25.387
But, by some lights,
he had it coming, the victim.

30:25.389 --> 30:28.724
By some lights, what happened
was what I might call,

30:28.726 --> 30:31.059
a community service.

30:32.261 --> 30:33.729
I feel like I'm being led.

30:33.731 --> 30:36.298
You are.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.867
What's bothering you is this:

30:38.869 --> 30:42.170
She killed the guy and is facing
the proper charges, right?

30:46.777 --> 30:51.380
I suggested we offer her a deal.

30:51.382 --> 30:54.182
The Chief ADA laughed
in my face.

30:54.184 --> 30:56.251
The victim's father
has tons of money,

30:56.253 --> 30:59.087
and friends in high places,
including, apparently,

30:59.089 --> 31:00.856
my office.

31:00.858 --> 31:04.192
But she's got her own attorney.

31:04.194 --> 31:06.428
Is he fighting a good fight?

31:06.430 --> 31:10.165
He's punching way above
his weight class.

31:10.167 --> 31:13.535
He's a solo practitioner
in mostly personal injury stuff.

31:13.537 --> 31:16.038
Against the full force
of the DA's office.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.439
Yeah.

31:17.441 --> 31:20.809
And she doesn't know that.

31:20.811 --> 31:23.045
But you do.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.579
Know what?

31:24.581 --> 31:27.416
That given the players,
the game is rigged.

31:29.052 --> 31:31.086
A little,
but that's not my problem.

31:31.088 --> 31:33.522
- You want her to have a fair trial?
- Of course I do.

31:33.524 --> 31:37.559
Sounds like you have to
make it your problem.

31:56.553 --> 31:58.354
I was surprised
to get your call.

31:58.356 --> 32:00.089
I was surprised
to make it.

32:00.091 --> 32:01.624
I assume you're aware
that Emily Harrison

32:01.626 --> 32:02.925
has been charged
with the murder

32:02.927 --> 32:04.060
of Brandon Mitchell?

32:04.062 --> 32:05.594
I've been
following the case.

32:05.596 --> 32:09.098
I'm sure it must be difficult
for you having represented him.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.367
So what can I do for you, Erin?

32:11.369 --> 32:13.636
When you and I both started
at the DA's office,

32:13.638 --> 32:16.172
I used to follow your cases.

32:16.174 --> 32:17.907
Why is that?

32:17.909 --> 32:21.143
You were relentless,
but never at the expense

32:21.145 --> 32:23.346
of achieving a just result.

32:24.481 --> 32:28.317
Then I sold out and became
a soulless defense attorney.

32:28.319 --> 32:29.852
Well, someone's got to do it.

32:29.854 --> 32:32.021
I'm sure you've had offers.

32:32.023 --> 32:34.423
Oh, I'm a career prosecutor,

32:34.425 --> 32:37.293
and my kid's got the
student loans to prove it.

32:40.464 --> 32:43.265
The State is charging Emily
with murder.

32:43.267 --> 32:45.801
Case is pretty strong
against her.

32:45.803 --> 32:47.236
She's claiming self-defense,

32:47.238 --> 32:50.573
but there's no evidence to
support that assertation.

32:50.575 --> 32:52.568
I'm sure her attorney can
provide effective counsel.

32:52.569 --> 32:53.435
I'm not.

32:53.436 --> 32:55.803
He's never tried
a murder case before.

32:55.804 --> 32:59.973
But he is the best lawyer
she can afford.

32:59.975 --> 33:03.310
It would be highly unusual for
me to represent Ms. Harrison

33:03.312 --> 33:05.545
having previously represented
Mr. Mitchell.

33:05.547 --> 33:08.214
Mr. Mitchell is dead and not
party to these proceedings.

33:08.216 --> 33:10.417
But I was a party
to her rape accusation.

33:10.419 --> 33:12.419
Which was never proven,
hence inadmissible

33:12.421 --> 33:13.887
and no conflict.

33:13.889 --> 33:15.622
A judge would
still have to sign off.

33:15.624 --> 33:16.823
It's no easy sell.

33:16.825 --> 33:19.959
And that's why you
get paid the big bucks.

33:21.262 --> 33:24.664
The question isn't whether
I could represent Ms. Harrison,

33:24.666 --> 33:26.099
but why I would.

33:26.101 --> 33:28.268
Well, only you can answer that.

33:28.270 --> 33:30.070
You and I

33:30.072 --> 33:32.439
both did our jobs
in Emily's rape case.

33:32.441 --> 33:36.109
The result was legally sound.

33:36.111 --> 33:37.711
But in my mind...

33:37.713 --> 33:40.180
it wasn't justice.

33:43.317 --> 33:45.385
<i>Look, I really</i>
<i>have to get to work,</i>

33:45.387 --> 33:47.253
Jamie. Camilla hates it
when I'm late.

33:47.255 --> 33:48.755
This won't take long.
We really need

33:48.757 --> 33:51.391
to get your living
situation stabilized.

33:51.393 --> 33:53.827
I'm doing everything I can
to find a place.

33:53.829 --> 33:56.162
I know, I just think
it's time we go another way.

33:57.331 --> 33:59.165
Camilla?

33:59.167 --> 34:01.134
Oh, my God, you called my boss?

34:01.136 --> 34:02.435
How could you do that?

34:02.437 --> 34:04.671
Actually, I think the
more pressing question

34:04.673 --> 34:07.140
is why you weren't
honest with me, Tara.

34:07.142 --> 34:08.742
I'm so sorry, Camilla. I...

34:08.744 --> 34:09.876
It's better she knows
what's going on.

34:09.878 --> 34:11.344
That wasn't
your decision to make.

34:11.346 --> 34:14.313
Am I to understand that you've
been living on the street?

34:14.315 --> 34:15.949
Well...

34:15.951 --> 34:17.117
sort of.

34:17.119 --> 34:18.318
More than sort of.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.453
Are you insane?

34:20.455 --> 34:22.589
Why didn't you come to me?

34:23.724 --> 34:24.991
She was afraid

34:24.993 --> 34:27.193
that you would fire her.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.996
She's the best assistant
I've ever had.

34:29.998 --> 34:32.065
Really?

34:32.067 --> 34:35.534
Trust me, I wouldn't
be here otherwise.

34:35.536 --> 34:38.170
One of our London editors
has a place on the East Side.

34:38.172 --> 34:40.607
You'll stay there until we
find a suitable apartment.

34:40.609 --> 34:43.676
Sounds like
a good deal, Tara.

34:45.246 --> 34:46.346
I've got a car outside.

34:46.348 --> 34:49.882
Thank you,
Officer Reagan.

34:51.185 --> 34:53.152
I don't know what to say.

34:53.155 --> 34:54.554
Thank you, Jamie.

34:54.556 --> 34:56.054
Good luck.

34:56.657 --> 34:59.225
Tara. Let's go.

34:59.227 --> 35:00.660
Um...

35:07.568 --> 35:09.869
You wanted to see me, boss?

35:09.871 --> 35:11.738
I do.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.973
You read the 49 on the incident
involving Sergeant Reed?

35:13.975 --> 35:15.642
- I did.
- Pretty conclusive.

35:15.644 --> 35:18.077
I concede how they would
conclude that his actions

35:18.079 --> 35:20.480
fell short
of department protocol.

35:20.482 --> 35:22.148
That said...

35:22.150 --> 35:24.884
I will not prepare
charges against him.

35:24.886 --> 35:27.153
All due respect, boss,

35:27.155 --> 35:29.322
that is a serious mistake.

35:29.324 --> 35:31.090
Well, it wouldn't be my first.
Reed may be

35:31.092 --> 35:33.126
a stand-up guy,
but he went south here.

35:33.128 --> 35:34.894
And he will get
a formal reprimand.

35:34.896 --> 35:37.430
We're not talking about a kid
fresh out of the academy.

35:37.432 --> 35:38.798
Reed's a sergeant. A boss.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.567
He's supposed
to lead by example.

35:40.569 --> 35:43.136
We're also not talking about
some cop drawing disability

35:43.138 --> 35:45.972
who gets caught playing
shortstop for his bar team.

35:45.974 --> 35:47.774
Oh, no, no, but still,
this is a breach.

35:47.776 --> 35:49.209
He has served this department

35:49.211 --> 35:51.010
with distinction and courage.
Well, he didn't

35:51.012 --> 35:53.179
show much courage in that
bodega the other morning.

35:53.181 --> 35:56.082
I believe that he felt
he could not move his daughter

35:56.084 --> 35:59.519
safely out of harm's way
and still aid that civilian.

35:59.521 --> 36:01.754
Had to be something he could do.
There was a hallway there.

36:01.756 --> 36:04.991
I wasn't there, Sid.
And neither were you.

36:04.993 --> 36:07.594
He had two lives to
protect that morning.

36:07.596 --> 36:11.097
He did what he thought
was right.

36:11.099 --> 36:13.867
Okay, so, when the C.O.'s start
calling me, asking why this guy

36:13.869 --> 36:16.870
walked away with a slap
on the wrist and what the hell

36:16.872 --> 36:19.806
they should tell their officers,
what the hell do I tell 'em?

36:19.808 --> 36:21.140
First, ask 'em something.

36:21.142 --> 36:22.876
Ask they were in his shoes--

36:22.878 --> 36:25.044
their wife, their daughter--

36:25.046 --> 36:27.180
what would they do?

36:27.182 --> 36:30.183
And then you tell 'em
family comes first.

36:46.166 --> 36:48.234
Erin.

36:48.236 --> 36:50.570
I understand Emily Harrison's
coming back in?

36:50.572 --> 36:52.672
Her attorney said she'd plead
guilty to the murder charge

36:52.674 --> 36:55.675
in exchange for the
sentence of 20 years.

36:57.011 --> 36:59.812
Okay. But not a day less.

37:00.681 --> 37:03.182
What's Deborah Moss doing here?

37:04.151 --> 37:06.653
Good question.

37:06.655 --> 37:09.756
Wait in the conference room,
Emily. I'll be right in.

37:11.659 --> 37:14.160
I'm replacing Mr. Gallo
as Emily's counsel.

37:14.162 --> 37:16.529
I wasn't aware Ms. Harrison
was in a position

37:16.531 --> 37:18.498
to afford your hourly rate.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.633
I'll be representing
Ms. Harrison pro Bono.

37:22.069 --> 37:24.070
This is an order from
Judge Marino clearing me

37:24.072 --> 37:26.773
of all conflict of interest
in this matter.

37:30.811 --> 37:32.645
I understand my client's
former counsel

37:32.647 --> 37:34.280
floated a potential plea?

37:34.282 --> 37:35.949
Guilty, in exchange
for 20 years.

37:35.951 --> 37:38.618
Right. That deal
is now off the table.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.019
I interviewed

37:40.021 --> 37:41.654
Liza Daniels again.

37:41.656 --> 37:43.289
It seems that once I

37:43.291 --> 37:44.490
pointed out the
penalty for perjury,

37:44.492 --> 37:46.993
apparently it jarred her memory.

37:46.995 --> 37:48.494
It seems she did, in fact,

37:48.496 --> 37:50.697
witness the shooting
and is prepared to testify

37:50.699 --> 37:52.865
that Mr. Mitchell
attacked my client,

37:52.867 --> 37:54.233
who acted in self-defense.

37:54.235 --> 37:56.169
Your murder
charge

37:56.171 --> 37:57.837
is dead and buried, guys.

37:57.839 --> 38:00.106
I suggest you
come up with an offer.

38:03.177 --> 38:05.478
Why would a shark
like Deborah Moss

38:05.480 --> 38:07.313
come to this girl's rescue?

38:07.315 --> 38:09.549
Maybe she felt like
she owed her one.

38:12.586 --> 38:14.053
Cut a deal.

38:39.446 --> 38:42.615
I know, I know, we need to stop
meeting like this.

38:46.620 --> 38:49.355
Uh, so, I think...

38:49.357 --> 38:50.890
we need to clear the air.

38:50.892 --> 38:52.525
Yeah.

38:54.061 --> 38:55.862
I've been thinking
about what you...

38:55.864 --> 38:58.898
you said about,
uh, me being jealous of Tara.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.634
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry.

39:01.636 --> 39:02.935
Yeah, well...

39:02.937 --> 39:04.570
the thing is, it...

39:04.572 --> 39:06.639
it's true.

39:08.108 --> 39:09.409
What are you talking about?

39:09.411 --> 39:12.979
I was jealous of Tara.

39:12.981 --> 39:15.648
Just like I'm jealous every time
you go on a date with somebody

39:15.650 --> 39:19.419
or you tell me about
some girl that's hot.

39:21.055 --> 39:22.321
Eddie...

39:22.323 --> 39:23.823
Can you please not talk?

39:23.825 --> 39:25.291
This is, you know...

39:25.293 --> 39:27.527
it's really hard.

39:27.529 --> 39:29.462
So just let me
get it off my chest.

39:29.464 --> 39:31.831
Okay.

39:33.033 --> 39:34.701
I have feelings for you.

39:34.703 --> 39:36.869
I have for a long time.

39:39.239 --> 39:41.441
There, I said it.

39:42.609 --> 39:45.311
I do everything that I can
to make them go away.

39:45.313 --> 39:48.181
Because, I mean, you're not even
close to my type. I mean,

39:48.183 --> 39:49.615
you are a
complete Boy Scout

39:49.617 --> 39:53.453
and you make me crazy
most of the time.

39:53.455 --> 39:55.621
You're also...

39:57.391 --> 40:01.194
the best person
I think I've ever met.

40:01.196 --> 40:05.098
And you're the best friend
that I've ever had.

40:05.100 --> 40:06.499
Look, I...

40:06.501 --> 40:07.600
Is that you talking?

40:07.602 --> 40:09.769
Sorry.

40:10.904 --> 40:13.840
I know that you're my partner.

40:13.842 --> 40:17.009
And I don't want to do anything
to screw that up.

40:17.011 --> 40:20.079
I just... I needed to tell you

40:20.081 --> 40:22.181
that you're so much
more than that.

40:22.183 --> 40:25.218
And if I didn't tell you
it was gonna get really weird.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.086
'Cause this doesn't
make things weird at all.

40:27.088 --> 40:28.154
I'm kidding!

40:28.156 --> 40:30.223
I'm kidding.

40:31.959 --> 40:34.794
Cards on the table?

40:34.796 --> 40:37.897
I have feelings for you, too.

40:37.899 --> 40:39.465
I think you know that.

40:39.467 --> 40:41.434
But we've been
down that road before.

40:41.436 --> 40:43.736
And it's a bad idea, for a...

40:43.738 --> 40:44.981
a lot of reasons.

40:44.982 --> 40:45.584
I know.

40:45.608 --> 40:47.107
It can really
cloud your judgment, and...

40:47.108 --> 40:49.575
totally screw up a partnership.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.644
Yeah. Totally.

40:51.646 --> 40:54.380
I just... You know,
I just wanted to be honest.

40:54.382 --> 40:56.415
Mm-hmm.

40:56.417 --> 40:57.850
Are we good?

40:57.852 --> 41:00.186
Definitely.

41:31.685 --> 41:33.886
Good talk.
See you tomorrow.

41:54.508 --> 41:55.842
Morning, Mrs. Reed.

41:55.844 --> 41:58.010
Commissioner?

42:00.247 --> 42:01.414
Morning, Ashley.

42:01.416 --> 42:03.449
What are you doing here?

42:03.451 --> 42:06.252
Well, I saw your dad.

42:06.254 --> 42:08.521
He's good, he's doing better.

42:08.523 --> 42:11.724
And he said that, uh, the
worst thing about getting hurt

42:11.726 --> 42:13.693
was that he couldn't
walk you to school,

42:13.695 --> 42:17.096
so I thought maybe

42:17.098 --> 42:20.099
I could stand in for him
for a while,

42:20.101 --> 42:22.134
till he's back on his feet.

42:24.238 --> 42:26.505
What do you think?

42:27.341 --> 42:28.908
Go ahead, Ashley.

42:30.777 --> 42:32.245
Okay.

42:35.482 --> 42:36.682
My dad's mad at me.

42:36.684 --> 42:37.984
What for?

42:37.986 --> 42:39.418
Yelling at you.

42:39.420 --> 42:40.686
Oh, don't worry about that.

42:40.688 --> 42:43.656
My daughter yells at me
all the time.

42:43.658 --> 42:45.324
They coming?

42:45.326 --> 42:46.792
Yeah.

42:46.794 --> 42:49.228
But you get used to it
after a while.
