11:22.467 --> 11:25.033
IT.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.667
THERE IS NO PLACE BETTER TO TALK

11:26.734 --> 11:27.734
ABOUT BORDER SECURITY THAN RIGHT

11:27.800 --> 11:32.700
HERE IN EL PASO.

11:32.767 --> 11:37.600
WHEN THAT WALL WENT UP, CRIME

11:37.667 --> 11:39.300
WENT WAY DOWN.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.834
NOW, YOU REALLY MEAN FINISH THAT

11:47.900 --> 11:49.834
WALL BECAUSE WE BUILT A LOT OF

11:49.900 --> 11:54.066
THIS.

11:54.133 --> 11:55.200
>> HERE WE STAND FOR AMERICA AND

11:55.266 --> 12:02.266
WE STAND AGAINST WALLS.

12:02.333 --> 12:06.066
EL PASO HAS BEEN THE SAFEST CITY

12:06.133 --> 12:07.300
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

12:07.367 --> 12:09.233
NOT IN SPITE OF THE FACT WE'RE A

12:09.300 --> 12:10.767
CITY OF IMMIGRANTS, BUT BECAUSE

12:10.834 --> 12:16.834
WE ARE A CITY OF IMMIGRANTS.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.700
WE ARE AN EXAMPLE OF THE UNITED

12:18.767 --> 12:19.333
STATES OF AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT

12:19.400 --> 12:21.433
NOW.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE I'D

12:23.567 --> 12:23.867
RATHER BE.

12:23.934 --> 12:31.700
I LOVE YOU, EL PASO!

12:40.667 --> 12:42.533
>> HAVE YOU DECIDED IF YOU'RE

12:42.600 --> 12:43.133
GOING TO RUN?

12:43.200 --> 12:44.834
>> I HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION YET

12:44.900 --> 12:46.133
BUT WILL ANNOUNCE IT.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.066
>> YOU'RE CONSIDERING IT?

12:47.133 --> 12:49.400
>> I'M CONSIDERING IT, YES.

12:54.600 --> 12:59.367
>> BETO O'ROURKE HAS SPOKEN,

12:59.433 --> 13:01.333
REVVED UP HIS CROWD, SHOOK ABOUT

13:01.400 --> 13:06.166
A THOUSAND HANDS AND LEFT IN A

13:06.233 --> 13:08.266
GIANT HEAVING SCRUM OF FANS AND

13:08.333 --> 13:11.433
REPORTERS AND OTHERS AND GOT

13:11.500 --> 13:12.200
HIMSELF IN HIS OWN CAR AND DROVE

13:12.266 --> 13:15.467
OFF AND DONALD TRUMP IS STILL UP

13:15.533 --> 13:17.900
THERE.

13:17.967 --> 13:20.200
>> THERE IS AN AGREEMENT IN

13:20.266 --> 13:22.100
PRINCIPLE TO AVERT A GOVERNMENT

13:22.166 --> 13:23.467
SHUTDOWN ON THE CRUCIAL QUESTION

13:23.533 --> 13:26.400
OF THE WALL.

13:26.467 --> 13:28.300
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER TRUMP IS

13:28.367 --> 13:28.900
GOING TO ACCEPT THIS DEAL OR

13:28.967 --> 13:30.934
NOT.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.800
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHAT THAT

13:32.867 --> 13:35.800
MAN HAS TO SAY.

13:35.867 --> 13:37.266
IN THE END, THAT'S THE

13:37.333 --> 13:39.000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER THE

13:39.066 --> 13:39.600
GOVERNMENT WILL SHUT DOWN OR

13:39.667 --> 13:43.767
NOT.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.266
>> LAST NIGHT, THE COUNTRY SAW

13:48.333 --> 13:49.834
THE GREAT AMERICAN DIVIDE,

13:49.900 --> 13:50.133
RIGHT?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.100
YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT DOWN IN

13:52.166 --> 13:55.567
EL PASO, YOU HAVE BETO O'ROURKE.

13:55.633 --> 13:58.633
WHO OFFERS THE MORE ACCURATE

13:58.700 --> 13:59.633
VISION OF WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.166
>> I WOULD START BY SAYING

14:01.233 --> 14:03.467
HOLDING RALLIES IS NOT GOING TO

14:03.533 --> 14:09.633
ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.567
MY DISTRICT IS TWO TIME ZONES

14:11.633 --> 14:12.834
AND IT'S ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF THE

14:12.900 --> 14:14.834
STATE OF GEORGIA.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.700
I HAVE MORE BORDER THAN ANY

14:16.767 --> 14:17.333
MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.734
>> RIGHT.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.734
>> 820 MILES.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.200
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE

14:22.266 --> 14:24.166
STRATEGY TO SECURE OUR BORDER,

14:24.233 --> 14:25.800
NOT ONE TOOL WITHIN THAT

14:25.867 --> 14:26.066
STRATEGY.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.900
>> SO, IS THERE GOING TO BE A

14:27.967 --> 14:28.967
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THE END OF

14:29.033 --> 14:29.233
THIS WEEK?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.633
>> I HOPE NOT.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.433
IF YOU DO BELIEVE BORDER

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
SECURITY IS A CRISIS, THE PEOPLE

14:35.567 --> 14:37.567
DEALING WITH THE CRISIS SHOULD

14:37.633 --> 14:41.467
GET PAID.

14:41.533 --> 14:42.834
>> IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME DEAL

14:42.900 --> 14:45.900
THAT WAS ON THE TABLE BEFORE THE

14:45.967 --> 14:47.433
SHUTDOWN, MAYBE EVEN SLIGHTLY

14:47.500 --> 14:48.266
LESS MONEY.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.066
>> WE SHOULD HAVE NEGOTIATED ALL

14:50.133 --> 14:51.300
THIS STUFF BEFORE THE ELECTION.

14:51.367 --> 14:52.166
>> YEAH.

14:52.233 --> 14:54.000
>> THAT WAS THE CRITICAL ERROR

14:54.066 --> 14:55.333
THAT WAS MADE.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.400
>> THE WHITE HOUSE, MICK

14:58.467 --> 15:00.967
MULVANEY, CHIEF OF STAFF, HAS

15:01.033 --> 15:02.133
SUGGESTED IF THE CONGRESS

15:02.200 --> 15:03.400
DOESN'T GIVE THIS PRESIDENT THE

15:03.467 --> 15:05.867
MONEY HE WANTS HE MAY FIND FUNDS

15:05.934 --> 15:06.166
ELSEWHERE.

15:06.233 --> 15:08.200
>> CAN THE PRESIDENT DECLARE A

15:08.266 --> 15:10.300
NATIONAL EMERGENCY?

15:10.367 --> 15:10.467
YES.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.033
BUT THERE WILL BE SO MANY

15:12.100 --> 15:13.266
CHALLENGES AND SO MANY PEOPLE

15:13.333 --> 15:15.200
FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,

15:15.266 --> 15:16.734
ESPECIALLY MY FRIEND FROM THE

15:16.800 --> 15:21.166
SENATE SAID IT WILL BE A BAD

15:21.233 --> 15:21.367
DEAL.

15:21.433 --> 15:24.467
>> SIR, WILL YOU SIGN CONGRESS'S

15:24.533 --> 15:24.934
BORDER DEAL?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
>> I HAVE TO STUDY IT.

15:27.066 --> 15:28.200
IT'S NOT DOING THE TRICK.

15:28.266 --> 15:30.233
>> ARE YOU CONSIDERING DECLARING

15:30.300 --> 15:32.266
A NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO BUILD

15:32.333 --> 15:32.667
THE WALL?

15:32.734 --> 15:34.033
>> I'M CONSIDERING EVERYTHING.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.467
I'M CONSIDERING EVERYTHING.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.767
>> IT IS STILL 629 DAYS UNTIL

15:37.834 --> 15:39.767
THE 2020 ELECTION, BUT YOU

15:39.834 --> 15:40.867
REALLY WOULDN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE

15:40.934 --> 15:42.633
THIS RACE IS NOT JUST HEATING

15:42.700 --> 15:43.033
UP.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.000
THE GROWING LIST OF TRUMP

15:45.066 --> 15:46.800
CHALLENGERS IS DOWN RIGHT HOT.

15:46.867 --> 15:49.500
>> IF YOU WANT TO BE PLAYER AND

15:49.600 --> 15:50.767
CONTENDER, ESPECIALLY IN

15:50.834 --> 15:52.166
PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS, YOU WILL

15:52.233 --> 15:53.700
PRACTICE THE DARK ART OF

15:53.767 --> 15:57.233
OPPOSITION RESEARCH.

15:57.300 --> 16:03.867
IN THIS NON-DEDE SCRIPT BUILDING

16:03.934 --> 16:06.767
IS THE RESEARCH OF AMERICA'S

16:06.834 --> 16:09.000
RISING AND THEY'RE ALREADY

16:09.066 --> 16:10.900
WORKING ON THE CONTENDERS AND

16:10.967 --> 16:12.600
RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF STORIES

16:12.667 --> 16:14.500
THE PRESS HAS ALREADY BEEN

16:14.567 --> 16:14.834
PUMPING OUT.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.633
>> HOW ARE YOU?

16:15.700 --> 16:19.033
>> MASTER OF DISASTER.

16:19.100 --> 16:19.433
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

16:19.500 --> 16:23.767
>> GOOD.

16:23.834 --> 16:26.367
>> SO THIS IS OUR WAR ROOM.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.033
>> AS I RECALL, YOU WERE AN

16:28.100 --> 16:30.100
INTERN IN THE WAR ROOM IN 2004.

16:30.166 --> 16:32.066
>> I WAS AN INTERN.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.467
THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY START.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.367
I WAS ONE OF THESE GUYS SITTING

16:36.433 --> 16:38.266
AT THIS DESK WATCHING AND SEEING

16:38.333 --> 16:39.133
EVERYTHING THESE CANDIDATES WERE

16:39.200 --> 16:41.433
DOING EVERY SINGLE DAY.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.500
PEOPLE THINK IT'S DUMPSTER

16:43.567 --> 16:44.900
DIVING AND WHAT NOT.

16:44.967 --> 16:46.633
REALLY, IT'S METHODICALLY GOING

16:46.700 --> 16:48.200
THROUGH THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

16:48.266 --> 16:49.133
INFORMATION ABOUT A CANDIDATE

16:49.200 --> 16:51.767
AND FINDING OUT OF THE FACTS YOU

16:51.834 --> 16:53.000
GATHERED, WHAT ARE THE

16:53.066 --> 16:54.734
NARRATIVES THAT COULD DEFINE

16:54.800 --> 16:57.266
THIS PERSON AND POSSIBLY DEFEAT

16:57.333 --> 16:57.734
THEM.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.900
ELECTIONS ARE CHOICES AND IT

16:59.967 --> 17:02.800
MAKES IT A CHOICE AND CONTRAST

17:02.867 --> 17:04.033
MESSAGES WIN ELECTIONS.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.133
>> THANKS, EVERYBODY.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.066
>> THEY WON'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE

17:09.133 --> 17:09.300
YOU.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.767
>> BOY, DO I KNOW THIS PHOTO.

17:12.834 --> 17:13.200
>> CLASSIC MOMENT.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.333
>> OH, YEAH.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.533
THIS BECAME THE MOST FAMOUS AD I

17:16.600 --> 17:19.433
WAS EVER INVOLVED IN.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.467
WHEN WE SAW THE FOOTAGE, MADE

17:21.533 --> 17:22.533
ITSELF IN 30 SECONDS.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.200
>> KERRY VOTED FOR THE IRAQ WAR,

17:25.266 --> 17:28.433
OPPOSED IT, SUPPORTED IT, NOW,

17:28.500 --> 17:29.266
OPPOSES IT AGAIN.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.100
JOHN KERRY, WHICH EVER WAY THE

17:31.166 --> 17:32.000
WIND BLOWS.

17:32.066 --> 17:32.567
>> RIGHT.

17:32.633 --> 17:34.200
HE WAS JUST ON VACATION.

17:34.266 --> 17:35.066
>> THEN WE PUT HIM ON A

17:35.133 --> 17:39.834
PERMANENT VACATION.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.700
>> SO CAN WE TALK SPECIFICALLY

17:41.767 --> 17:42.433
ABOUT 2020?

17:42.500 --> 17:43.100
>> ABSOLUTELY.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.667
>> WHAT ARE YOU FOCUSING ON

17:44.734 --> 17:45.233
RIGHT NOW?

17:45.300 --> 17:47.000
>> WE HAVE A HUGE FIELD.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.600
THE FIELD IS GETTING BIGGER

17:48.667 --> 17:49.433
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.166
THE FIELD OF DEMOCRATS.

17:51.233 --> 17:51.834
>> THE DEMOCRATS.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.100
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE HOW THE

17:54.166 --> 17:55.500
NARRATIVES ARE DEPLOYING AND

17:55.567 --> 17:56.834
SHAPE THOSE NARRATIVES.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.033
>> HAVE YOU BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR

17:59.100 --> 18:00.767
NEWS THAT'S COME OUT IN THE PAST

18:00.834 --> 18:01.734
COUPLE OF WEEKS?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.000
>> THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WE HAVE

18:04.066 --> 18:05.133
BEEN PUBLICLY ASSOCIATED WITH.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.166
SOME WE DO NO FINGERPRINTS,

18:07.233 --> 18:07.433
OBVIOUSLY.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.300
THERE IS ONE ON SENATOR HARRIS.

18:09.367 --> 18:11.600
>> RIGHT.

18:11.667 --> 18:17.033
>> AT ASPEN CNN TOWN HALL ABOUT

18:17.100 --> 18:19.767
MEDICARE FOR ALL AND ELIMINATING

18:19.834 --> 18:21.567
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.166
>> WHO HAVE US HAVE HAD TO WAIT

18:23.233 --> 18:24.900
FOR APPROVAL AND YOUR DOCTOR

18:24.967 --> 18:26.300
SAY, WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR

18:26.367 --> 18:27.700
INSURANCE WILL COVER THIS.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.200
LET'S ELIMINATE ALL OF THIS,

18:29.266 --> 18:30.333
LET'S MOVE ON.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.934
>> THE MOMENT SHE SAID THAT, OUR

18:33.000 --> 18:34.266
COMMUNICATIONS TEAM PUSHED THAT

18:34.333 --> 18:37.800
OUT THE DOOR AND INFORMED OUR

18:37.867 --> 18:39.700
PARTNERS ABOUT IT AND I THINK IT

18:39.767 --> 18:42.367
WILL BE A DEFINING CLIP IN 2020.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.867
>> WOULD YOU SAY THAT WILL

18:44.934 --> 18:45.633
DEFINE THEIR GAME?

18:45.700 --> 18:51.400
>> NONE OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE

18:51.467 --> 18:53.533
ON TOP OF THEIR GAME.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.633
SENATOR HARRIS, AND SENATOR

18:56.700 --> 18:57.900
WARREN, WE'RE STILL FINDING OUT

18:57.967 --> 18:58.333
ABOUT IT.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.500
AND TALKING ABOUT BETO RUNNING

19:00.567 --> 19:01.500
FOR PRESIDENT.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.567
JUST RAN IN A SENATE RACE AND

19:03.633 --> 19:04.800
HOUSE RACE.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.834
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS A WHOLE

19:06.900 --> 19:07.233
DIFFERENT LEVEL.

19:07.300 --> 19:11.166
>> FROM SPA TO ACID BATH.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.433
>> 0-500.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.600
>> AND TO ACCELERATE IT.

19:16.667 --> 19:17.800
>> ACCELERATE IT.

19:17.867 --> 19:19.667
OUR JOB IS TO MAKE THAT JOB AS

19:19.734 --> 19:21.633
DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.100
>> WE'RE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY

19:23.166 --> 19:24.300
ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, ABOUT TO GO

19:24.367 --> 19:28.433
TO DINNER WITH FOUR OF THE MOST

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL

19:30.567 --> 19:34.200
DEMOCRATIC SUPER DONORS.

19:34.266 --> 19:37.133
TWO OF THEM, LONG TIME CLINTON

19:37.200 --> 19:37.367
BACKERS.

19:37.433 --> 19:41.934
TWO OF THEM, VERY EARLY OEB

19:42.000 --> 19:42.233
SUPPORTERS.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.834
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DISCONCERTING

19:44.900 --> 19:46.800
WITH FOUR PEOPLE WHOSE COMBINED

19:46.867 --> 19:51.867
NET WORTH IS 100 TIMES MINE.

19:51.934 --> 19:54.133
EARLY OBAMA SUPPORTERS.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.834
WHAT FEELS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE

19:56.900 --> 19:57.433
DEMOCRATIC RACE?

19:57.500 --> 20:00.433
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN OUR

20:00.500 --> 20:01.867
POLITICAL CAREER WE HAD A WIDE

20:01.934 --> 20:02.467
OPEN FIELD.

20:02.533 --> 20:04.367
>> THERE'S A REASON NONE OF US

20:04.433 --> 20:06.100
TODAY ARE SAYING THIS IS WHO I

20:06.166 --> 20:07.734
THINK IS THE PERSON.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.667
NORMALLY, BY FEBRUARY IN PAST

20:09.734 --> 20:10.767
ELECTIONS, WE WERE SITTING AT

20:10.834 --> 20:14.700
THE TABLE WITH THE CANDIDATE.

20:14.767 --> 20:17.233
>> PASSING A LITMUS TEST ON THE

20:17.300 --> 20:18.300
BASIS OF ISSUES AND NOW ON THE

20:18.367 --> 20:20.667
ISSUE OF WINNING.

20:20.734 --> 20:22.834
>> I LOOK AT IT AS WHO IS GOING

20:22.900 --> 20:24.433
TO CONNECT WITH THE VOTERS THAT

20:24.500 --> 20:26.000
IT TAKES TO WIN?

20:26.066 --> 20:28.133
WE CAN'T MISS WISCONSIN, WE

20:28.233 --> 20:32.934
CAN'T MISS MICHIGAN AGAIN.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.700
>> WHAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE

20:34.767 --> 20:36.967
DETERMINING FACTORS FOR WHO YOU

20:37.033 --> 20:37.367
SUPPORT?

20:37.433 --> 20:38.734
>> ARE THEY KNOWN?

20:38.800 --> 20:42.266
YOU CAN'T GO ON STAGE IN JUNE AT

20:42.333 --> 20:43.600
THE DEBATE AND INTRODUCE

20:43.667 --> 20:43.900
YOURSELF.

20:43.967 --> 20:45.367
WHO CAN RUN AN ORGANIZATION.

20:45.433 --> 20:48.100
>> RUNNING A CAMPAIGN IS A

20:48.166 --> 20:49.567
STARTUP THAT GOES FROM NOTHING

20:49.633 --> 20:51.500
TO MULTI-BILLION.

20:51.567 --> 20:52.967
>> WHO CAN RAISE THE MONEY AND

20:53.033 --> 20:54.433
BE COMPETITIVE AND WHO CAN WIN?

20:54.500 --> 20:55.900
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE

20:55.967 --> 20:57.767
THINK THOSE WHO CAN DO WELL IN

20:57.834 --> 20:59.433
THE PRIMARY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

20:59.500 --> 21:01.734
WIN THE GENERAL AND VICE-VERSA.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.100
I THINK WE'RE REALLY STRUGGLING

21:03.166 --> 21:03.900
ON THAT.

21:03.967 --> 21:09.667
I SPOKE WITH VICE PRESIDENT

21:09.734 --> 21:09.867
BIDEN.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.934
EVERYONE SAYS YOU'RE A GREAT

21:12.000 --> 21:13.200
GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE BUT

21:13.266 --> 21:14.000
STRUGGLE IN THE PRIMARY.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.266
HE HAS A GREAT PITCH OF WHY I'M

21:16.333 --> 21:16.500
WRONG.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.166
>> YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT HOW

21:18.233 --> 21:18.433
LONG AGO?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.700
>> ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE HOURS AGO.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.100
>> FOUR HOURS AGO.

21:22.166 --> 21:22.867
IN OR OUT?

21:22.934 --> 21:25.100
>> IT FEELS TO ME HE'S IN.

21:25.166 --> 21:28.400
FEELS ABOUT 90%.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.834
THE POSITIVE IS HE WAS THE

21:29.900 --> 21:32.000
NUMBER ONE SURROGATE IN THE

21:32.066 --> 21:32.266
MID-TERMS.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.100
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD

21:34.166 --> 21:35.533
PLAY EVERYWHERE.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.533
HE IS VERY ELECTABLE.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.867
>> I DISAGREE.

21:38.934 --> 21:42.066
I BELIEVE KAMALA CAN WIN THE

21:42.133 --> 21:44.233
GENERAL AND THE PRIMARIES.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.033
I WAS CRUNCHING AROUND IN THE

21:46.100 --> 21:49.834
SNOW WITH KAMALA AND SEEN HER

21:49.900 --> 21:52.934
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE DCOME OUT AN

21:53.000 --> 21:53.133
VOTE.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.133
>> KAMALA IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE

21:55.200 --> 21:57.133
I KNOW BEEN ABLE TO REACH OUT TO

21:57.200 --> 21:59.567
A DONOR COMMUNITY.

21:59.633 --> 22:03.367
>> ABILITY TO BRING OUT A

22:03.433 --> 22:05.767
MILLION AND A HALF IN 24 HOURS

22:05.834 --> 22:06.934
AND BRING OUT PEOPLE.

22:07.000 --> 22:07.934
>> AND BROWRK.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.333
>> THAT ENERGY, YOU CAN'T

22:10.400 --> 22:11.500
MANUFACTURING THAT ENERGY.

22:11.567 --> 22:14.233
IT'S EITHER THERE OR NOT.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.600
>> THE NEGATIVE IS WE DON'T KNOW

22:16.667 --> 22:18.166
HIM, DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM.

22:18.233 --> 22:21.233
I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING HIM IN

22:21.300 --> 22:23.633
THE EYE AND SAYING, IS THIS GUY

22:23.700 --> 22:24.433
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.133
WE DID THAT WITH BARACK OBAMA.

22:26.233 --> 22:28.200
WE LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE AND IN

22:28.266 --> 22:30.233
OUR OPINION, HE WAS THAT GUY.

22:30.300 --> 22:34.100
>> WHO IS YOUR DARK HORSE?

22:34.166 --> 22:34.300
>>.

22:34.367 --> 22:41.500
>> AMY CKLOBUCHAR.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.533
I THINK SHE HAS A BRIGHT WIT AND

22:43.600 --> 22:45.467
FUNNY AND WOULD DESTROY DONALD

22:45.533 --> 22:45.700
TRUMP.

22:45.767 --> 22:46.900
>> I'M LESS WORRIED ABOUT DONALD

22:46.967 --> 22:47.266
TRUMP.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.700
I THINK ANY NUMBER OF THE

22:48.767 --> 22:51.633
CANDIDATES WE'VE BEEN TALKING

22:51.700 --> 22:53.066
ABOUT CAN AND WILL BEAT TRUMP.

22:53.133 --> 22:55.433
>> WE SHOULD NOT BE

22:55.500 --> 22:56.300
UNDERESTIMATING PRESIDENT TRUMP

22:56.367 --> 22:58.500
WHETHER HE CAN OR CANNOT WIN A

22:58.567 --> 22:59.633
GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE HE

22:59.700 --> 23:03.533
SHOWED HE COULD WIN.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.133
>> CONGRESS IS SET TO VOTE TODAY

23:05.200 --> 23:07.266
ON A BILL TO AVOID ANOTHER

23:07.300 --> 23:08.333
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.533
>> IT FALLS WAY SHORT OF THE

23:10.600 --> 23:11.500
PRESIDENT'S DEMAND.

23:11.567 --> 23:13.200
>> WHICH COMPLICATES HIS NEW

23:13.266 --> 23:15.867
2020 FINISH THE WALL SLOGAN.

23:15.934 --> 23:18.000
>> TODAY MARKS A DEFEAT FOR

23:18.066 --> 23:18.400
TRUMP.

23:18.467 --> 23:19.867
HE IS BASICALLY BEING ASKED TO

23:19.934 --> 23:23.033
SIGN A BILL THAT DOESN'T GIVE

23:23.100 --> 23:25.066
HIM THE THING THAT HE HAS WANTED

23:25.133 --> 23:26.233
PERHAPS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

23:26.300 --> 23:28.367
IN HIS PRESIDENCY, HIS BORDER

23:28.433 --> 23:28.700
WALL.

23:28.767 --> 23:30.867
THERE SEEMS TO BE BIPARTISAN

23:30.934 --> 23:32.967
SUPPORT FOR THE BILL, BUT AS

23:33.033 --> 23:35.834
USUAL, THERE IS ONE GIANTIC

23:35.900 --> 23:37.500
POWERFUL MER CURIAL VARIABLE IN

23:37.567 --> 23:39.934
ALL OF THIS, DONALD J. TRUMP.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.700
>> THIS IS THE SPENDING BILL

23:41.767 --> 23:43.834
THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER.

23:43.900 --> 23:44.367
>> WAIT.

23:44.433 --> 23:45.100
THIS IS IT?

23:45.166 --> 23:48.767
>> THIS IS IT.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.367
TO DECIDE WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT

23:50.433 --> 23:51.367
STAYS OPEN OR NOT.

23:51.433 --> 23:53.533
>> THIS IS THE CAUSE OF SO MUCH

23:53.600 --> 23:54.166
HEART BREAK?

23:54.233 --> 23:54.667
>> IT IS.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.800
AS SOON AS THE SENATE MEETS WE

23:56.867 --> 23:59.567
WILL BRING IT TO THE FLOOR TODAY

23:59.633 --> 24:00.066
AND HAVE A VOTE.

24:00.133 --> 24:01.300
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE WAITING FOR THE

24:01.367 --> 24:02.867
PRESIDENT TO GIVE A SIGNAL TO

24:02.934 --> 24:04.800
THE SENATE HE WILL SIGN IT IF IT

24:04.867 --> 24:06.000
GETS PASSED.

24:06.066 --> 24:09.867
>> IT'S A BAD MOMENT FOR THIS

24:09.934 --> 24:10.166
PRESIDENT.

24:10.233 --> 24:15.200
HE LOST A BIG PUBLIC BATTLE OVER

24:15.266 --> 24:16.500
WALL FUNDING.

24:16.567 --> 24:19.934
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HE HAS TO EAT

24:20.000 --> 24:22.500
CROW AND SIGN IT IN ORDER TO

24:22.567 --> 24:23.400
SAVE FACE.

24:23.467 --> 24:24.734
>> JUST SPOKE TO TRUMP.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.100
>> HE'S PREPARED TO SIGN THE

24:26.166 --> 24:29.300
BILL AND WILL ALSO BE ISSUING A

24:29.367 --> 24:31.133
NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION

24:31.200 --> 24:32.133
AT THE SAME TIME.

24:32.200 --> 24:32.767
>> YEAH.

24:32.834 --> 24:34.834
>> SO, WHAT HAPPENS IF HE DOES

24:34.900 --> 24:35.100
THAT?

24:35.166 --> 24:36.633
>> I HOPE WE'LL HAVE A

24:36.700 --> 24:40.867
RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL PASSED

24:40.934 --> 24:42.633
IN THE HOUSE THE SENATE WILL BE

24:42.700 --> 24:44.834
FORCED TO VOTE ON AND GO TO THE

24:44.900 --> 24:45.300
COURTS AS WELL.

24:45.367 --> 24:46.800
>> THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY YOU

24:46.867 --> 24:48.667
THINK IS IMMEDIATELY DEADLOCKED

24:48.734 --> 24:49.233
IN COURTS?

24:49.300 --> 24:50.900
>> I DO.

24:50.967 --> 24:52.166
WE WOULD BASICALLY THEN TRY TO

24:52.233 --> 24:55.767
FIND WAYS TO PROTECT EMERGENCY

24:55.834 --> 24:58.100
MONIES FOR DISASTERS SO HE CAN'T

24:58.166 --> 24:58.934
DIP INTO THAT.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.800
>> DO YOU THINK HE THINKS IT'S A

25:01.867 --> 25:04.500
WIN IF HE CALLS IT A NATIONAL

25:04.567 --> 25:04.767
EMERGENCY?

25:04.834 --> 25:06.633
>> WHO KNOWS WHAT HE THINKS.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.233
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

25:09.300 --> 25:10.066
NATIONAL PUBLIC WILL THINK?

25:10.133 --> 25:11.934
>> I THINK THEY WILL BE

25:12.000 --> 25:13.433
CONCERNED HE'S STRETCHINGHY

25:13.500 --> 25:15.333
POWERS HE HAS THE RIGHT TO DO.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.066
WE WILL FIGHT HIM AND FIGHT HIM

25:16.133 --> 25:19.266
LIKE HELL.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.200
>> IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO CALL A

25:22.266 --> 25:23.200
NATIONAL EMERGENCY?

25:23.266 --> 25:24.767
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

25:24.834 --> 25:27.100
THE PRESIDENT TAKES AN OATH TO

25:27.166 --> 25:27.967
KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE.

25:28.033 --> 25:30.734
>> YOU'RE IN THE LEGISLATIVE

25:30.800 --> 25:33.033
BRANCH, HE'S IN THE EXECUTIVE

25:33.100 --> 25:34.934
BRANCH AND LOOKS LIKE HE'S

25:35.000 --> 25:37.233
MAKING A RUN AROUND --

25:37.300 --> 25:39.200
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS OTHER

25:39.266 --> 25:40.667
MONEYS APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS

25:40.734 --> 25:42.200
AND FRANKLY WE HAVE A CRISIS

25:42.266 --> 25:43.934
THAT HAS TO GET RESOLVED.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.100
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.200
>> SENATOR MARKEY.

25:47.266 --> 25:50.433
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

25:50.500 --> 25:50.800
HERE?

25:50.867 --> 25:53.233
>> IT'S GOING TO SET A

25:53.300 --> 25:55.700
PRECEDENCE THAT WILL FURTHER

25:55.767 --> 25:58.266
UNDERMINE THE LEGISLATIVE

25:58.333 --> 25:58.600
PROCESS.

25:58.667 --> 25:59.633
FUTURE PRESIDENTS WILL FEEL THAT

25:59.700 --> 26:01.467
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE

26:01.533 --> 26:04.000
THAT ALREADY GOING TO DECLARE AN

26:04.066 --> 26:07.100
EMERGENCY EVERY TIME THEY

26:07.166 --> 26:08.266
DISAGREE TO WHAT WAS AGREED TO

26:08.333 --> 26:12.367
IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE.

26:12.433 --> 26:17.133
THAT WAS NEVER ENVISIONED IN THE

26:17.200 --> 26:18.233
HOUSE AND SENATE.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.734
>> THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO

26:19.800 --> 26:22.066
SIGN INTO LAW SPENDING BILL

26:22.133 --> 26:23.633
PASSED IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION,

26:23.700 --> 26:25.500
AT THE SAME TIME, HE'S ALSO

26:25.567 --> 26:31.100
GOING TO DECLARE A NATIONAL

26:31.166 --> 26:31.367
EMERGENCY.

26:31.433 --> 26:32.066
THIS IS ALL ABOUT REELECTION

26:32.133 --> 26:32.266
TIME.

26:32.333 --> 26:35.934
>> CHECK CHECK, HEY HEY.

26:36.000 --> 26:36.233
CHECK CHECK.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.433
>> AFTER 2020, IT TAKES IT OFF

26:38.500 --> 26:42.734
THE TABLE AS A WEAKNESS, AND HE

26:42.800 --> 26:44.033
CAN SAY, I'VE WON.

26:44.100 --> 26:48.066
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE

26:48.133 --> 26:52.367
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

26:52.433 --> 26:55.100
>> SO, I'M GOING TO BE SIGNING A

26:55.166 --> 26:57.133
NATIONAL EMERGENCY, IT'S BEEN

26:57.200 --> 27:03.600
SIGNED MANY TIMES BEFORE.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.233
THERE'S RARELY BEEN A PROBLEM.

27:05.300 --> 27:08.066
THEY SIGN IT, NOBODY CARES.

27:08.133 --> 27:09.767
I COULD HAVE DONE THE WALL OVER

27:09.834 --> 27:11.400
A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

27:11.467 --> 27:14.266
I DON'T NEED DO THIS.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.033
I COULD DO IT MUCH FASTER.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.400
I'VE ALREADY DONE A LOT OF WALL

27:18.467 --> 27:20.467
FOR THE ELECTION, 2020.

27:20.533 --> 27:22.266
THE ONLY REASON WE'RE UP HERE

27:22.333 --> 27:23.133
TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE OF

27:23.200 --> 27:23.734
THE ELECTION.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.266
THEY WANT TO WIN AN ELECTION

27:25.333 --> 27:29.533
WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE NOT

27:29.600 --> 27:34.333
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.667
THE ORDER IS SIGNED.

27:37.734 --> 27:40.133
THEY WILL THEN SUE US AND IN THE

27:40.200 --> 27:41.800
NINTH CIRCUIT WE WILL GET A BAD

27:41.867 --> 27:43.400
RULING AND GET ANOTHER BAD

27:43.467 --> 27:45.033
RULING AND END UP IN THE SUPREME

27:45.100 --> 27:46.900
COURT AND HOPEFULLY GET A FAIR

27:46.967 --> 27:50.867
SHAKE AND WIN IN THE SUPREME

27:50.934 --> 27:53.600
COURT.

27:53.667 --> 27:53.867
OKAY.

27:53.934 --> 27:58.200
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

27:58.266 --> 28:00.200
>> I WENT TO THE MOVIE AND THE

28:00.266 --> 28:01.033
MOVIE WAS BAD.

28:01.100 --> 28:05.433
I WENT TO YOUR ROOM BUT YOU HAD

28:05.500 --> 28:07.834
ALREADY BEEN HAD, AND I WENT TO

28:07.900 --> 28:08.900
THE SHOW AND THE SHOW WAS SAD ♪
