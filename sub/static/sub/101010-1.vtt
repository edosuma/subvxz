WEBVTT

01:00.294 --> 01:02.362
Foxes were commonly
known as beasts of the chase

01:02.396 --> 01:03.665
by medieval times.

01:03.698 --> 01:04.831
The equestrian tradition

01:04.866 --> 01:07.367
eventually found
its way to the States.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.470
Hell, George Washington
owned a pack of hounds.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.439
It takes discipline.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.676
You have to know how
to ride. Know the calls.

01:14.709 --> 01:17.612
You have to have your wits about
you on cold autumn mornings.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.080
The bourbon can only do so much.

01:21.281 --> 01:24.418
I've come to
love it, the chase that is.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.219
There are those
that would condemn it.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.454
They wouldn't understand.

01:27.487 --> 01:31.258
We are all chasing something.
Something we may never see.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.160
Something so elusive,

01:33.193 --> 01:35.597
it was never
there to begin with.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.873
My name is Cotton.
No, it's not a nickname

01:45.907 --> 01:47.875
but it is an appropriate one.

01:47.909 --> 01:50.578
The old South is all
but forgotten, so I wrote

01:50.612 --> 01:53.313
a short story about it years
ago. Got it published and it was

01:53.347 --> 01:56.350
read, widely.

01:58.553 --> 02:01.121
I was just a boy then.

02:02.724 --> 02:04.726
There is a way of life
that's been lost.

02:04.759 --> 02:07.895
Unable to wash the stains
of history from its linens.

02:07.929 --> 02:10.263
But there's something
sweet in the seams.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.800
You'll read
about it in my novel,

02:16.336 --> 02:18.338
so I'd rather not spoil it.

02:20.508 --> 02:24.444
Well,
this should be humiliating.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.481
All the other girls have
proper escorts and I have you.

02:45.967 --> 02:49.771
Although it's not your fault
my father's a complete asshole.

02:54.709 --> 02:57.812
Don't fuck
this up for me, Cotton.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.959
The annual Debutante Ball.

03:11.993 --> 03:13.594
My niece is the one in white,

03:13.628 --> 03:15.830
though I'm not
sure she deserves it.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.965
Everything in
the South is tradition.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.834
Becoming a
gentleman is expected.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.870
Becoming a lady is showmanship.

03:23.137 --> 03:26.574
It's a facade. A
pony show for society, where

03:26.607 --> 03:29.510
everyone pretends life is the
way we see it in photographs,

03:29.544 --> 03:31.713
perfect and clean.

03:31.913 --> 03:34.582
Like those white gowns.

03:41.556 --> 03:44.391
What are we hiding?

03:44.424 --> 03:46.426
My brother Whitman vanished some

03:46.460 --> 03:49.329
years ago, for what
or who we still aren't clear.

03:49.362 --> 03:50.865
My sister
would just as soon shoot me as

03:50.898 --> 03:53.868
she would give me a smile. My
father spends more time on

03:53.901 --> 03:56.269
ancient soils for blood sport
then he does tending the family

03:56.303 --> 03:59.540
or its business, a decently
circulated yet poorly written

03:59.574 --> 04:02.009
newspaper coined The Carolinian
by our Great Grandfather nearly

04:02.043 --> 04:05.713
a century ago. My mother would
care if there was more oolong

04:05.747 --> 04:09.382
than booze in her tea. There is
one silver lining in the whole

04:09.416 --> 04:12.754
lot of them, Grandmother. I
could tell you her life's story

04:12.787 --> 04:15.022
but you'd have
to hear it in her words.

04:15.056 --> 04:17.290
Then there's me, Cotton.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.894
One of the last gentleman the
old South has to offer,

04:19.927 --> 04:23.564
though no one would ever care.

04:23.598 --> 04:25.633
Amanda Hastings.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.736
Going once,
going twice, sold American!

04:28.770 --> 04:29.704
Where have you been?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.039
I was, I was looking
for you this whole time.

04:32.073 --> 04:34.509
Oh my God. Christ, you smell
like a distillery. Real nice.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.576
You don't even know-

04:35.610 --> 04:38.378
Okay, I don't care just,
just walk me center stage,

04:38.411 --> 04:39.379
and get out of my way.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.515
You look fantastic, by the way.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.582
You disgust me.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.050
Oh, come on.

04:43.084 --> 04:45.653
Lily O'Connor.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.426
Miss June,
nice to see you again.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.597
Good evening, miss.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.899
Uh,
it was so much fun Aesop.

05:31.933 --> 05:34.669
I love this place.

05:54.856 --> 05:57.124
Quite a show, out there.

05:57.158 --> 06:00.127
What? Oh, yep.

06:00.161 --> 06:03.998
Becoming a lady
has always been a spectacle.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.367
Well I wasn't
referrin' to the ladies, Cotton.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.403
One would think you'd
have more a bit more couth.

06:10.437 --> 06:13.808
What, with
your recent induction.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.911
Oh relax, relax.

06:16.944 --> 06:21.148
No one gives a damn
what us dogs are barkin' about.

06:21.182 --> 06:25.019
It's been really
tough, lately, Mr. Wentworth.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.656
Oh yes, of course.
How could it not be, what, for

06:28.689 --> 06:33.561
a, the youngest heir of a
well-to-do publishing dynasty.

06:36.197 --> 06:38.633
It's harder than it sounds.

06:38.666 --> 06:42.503
There is a code
that a Gentlemen must adhere to.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.172
Our code.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.514
I understand.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.482
I'm proud of
my selection, I assure you.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.786
Then act like it. You knew what
you were getting into when you

06:58.819 --> 07:02.657
took that oath. You are an
O'Connor, the first of our Order

07:02.690 --> 07:05.760
and the future
publisher of The Times.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.829
Publisher?

07:08.863 --> 07:13.534
My brother
Whitman will return, someday.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.979
Look at 'em.

07:25.012 --> 07:29.016
Spinning
about in blissful ignorance.

07:31.652 --> 07:36.456
If they only knew about
the men behind the curtain.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.745
Louise.

07:57.778 --> 08:01.248
Where are you running off to?

08:01.282 --> 08:04.785
I was just um, nowhere.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.857
I'm sorry about the
Ball. Lily despises me.

08:09.890 --> 08:14.795
Oh, she'll be fine or she'll

08:14.829 --> 08:19.499
harbor it for years,
but, eh, what does it matter.

08:21.969 --> 08:25.106
Ya know
I really thought he'd show.

08:25.139 --> 08:28.509
If not for his daughter, then
at least for his reputation.

08:30.311 --> 08:33.514
He gave that up long ago.

08:36.851 --> 08:41.789
If you knew where Whitman was,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

08:42.356 --> 08:43.823
Sure.

08:47.795 --> 08:51.599
Whitman
will return, eventually.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.205
For the paper, if nothing else.

09:05.346 --> 09:08.949
I'm sure this hasn't
been easy on you, Louise.

09:13.821 --> 09:17.625
No, no it hasn't.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.222
To you all, this is goodbye.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.624
I have to see what
lays beyond the pines.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.359
Out there
among faceless strangers and

09:52.393 --> 09:55.629
hurried travelers
scurrying to far off lands.

09:55.663 --> 09:58.766
I can't write anymore
because I have no more to say.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.002
And who would care to
know what we have become.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.976
Whitman had it right.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.046
Do not think this
is for lack of love or kinship.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.216
You are my family.
Wherever I am out there,

10:15.249 --> 10:19.019
I will think of
you often and fondly.

10:23.157 --> 10:27.361
Know that you didn't do this
to me, we did this to ourselves.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.864
And though I may meet an end,

10:29.897 --> 10:33.901
I know, somewhere,
there is still hope.

10:34.435 --> 10:37.972
And who knows,

10:38.005 --> 10:41.008
maybe I'll find
something to write about.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.779
That's terrible news.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.316
No, no, do what
you have to do.

11:24.218 --> 11:29.089
I'll be in as
soon as I can. Oh, and Aesop?

11:30.424 --> 11:32.793
Call the lawyer.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.481
May I use your phone.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.224
Call for you, Sir.

12:15.002 --> 12:18.239
My Grandmother's dead.

12:18.272 --> 12:20.474
¿De lo que se murió?
(What did she die of?)

12:20.508 --> 12:23.043
They didn't say.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.754
Hello?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.347
Hello Mother.

14:06.380 --> 14:09.183
Darling, you're home.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.484
Oh, it's been so long.

14:10.518 --> 14:13.555
I'm so glad to see you.

14:13.588 --> 14:16.490
I do wish it were under better
circumstances, of course.

14:16.524 --> 14:21.529
I'm sorry. I came as soon as
I could. When's the funeral?

14:22.029 --> 14:27.000
But, it was this morning.
That's what all this is about.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.306
How could this happen?

14:32.339 --> 14:34.609
Arrangements were made.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.579
It was a lovely
service, darling, truly.

14:37.612 --> 14:39.012
You would have approved.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.448
Most of the city was there.

14:41.750 --> 14:45.587
She was a fine woman, Cotton.
A fine woman, indeed.

14:49.724 --> 14:54.596
May I have a word,
Mother? In private.

14:54.629 --> 14:57.164
Excuse us, will you?

15:01.101 --> 15:01.935
Where's Father?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.937
Well I have absolutely no idea.

15:03.971 --> 15:07.241
Last I heard, he speared
a cougar through the throat.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.144
Absurd. What of
Whitman and Marietta?

15:10.177 --> 15:13.648
Wait, don't tell me.

15:14.448 --> 15:17.685
It's insanity that
none of us were here.

15:17.719 --> 15:18.787
Well Aesop was.

15:18.820 --> 15:23.023
He's practically family.
Will you be staying long?

15:23.056 --> 15:27.995
Why? So you can save
face at the club, for once?

15:28.596 --> 15:31.498
My mother has just died.

15:31.533 --> 15:34.968
Mother in law.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.638
How did she go, by the way?

15:36.671 --> 15:38.439
Hm, I find that so strange.

15:38.472 --> 15:41.475
That's all people keep asking.

15:41.509 --> 15:44.546
Have you been to church lately?

15:44.579 --> 15:46.648
Jesus Christ.

15:51.786 --> 15:55.088
He seems different.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.092
Esse Quam Videri.
(to be seen)

16:48.676 --> 16:52.346
You know,

16:53.413 --> 16:56.350
that woman adored you.

16:57.519 --> 17:00.522
White's a bit much.

17:01.589 --> 17:04.290
It's off white.

17:09.128 --> 17:12.132
How long are you in for?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.468
Not sure.

17:14.502 --> 17:16.804
How's Paris?

17:17.069 --> 17:22.276
I moved back. Turns out,
not all Frenchmen are romantic.

17:23.011 --> 17:25.547
I've been staying
in the blue room, actually.

17:25.579 --> 17:27.214
Well, it's not
really blue anymore.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.516
More of a lilac.

17:28.550 --> 17:29.717
At our house?

17:29.751 --> 17:32.319
Yes. Your mother
insisted after my folks

17:32.352 --> 17:33.487
moved to Charleston.

17:33.521 --> 17:35.255
Turned out
my father had an entire second

17:35.289 --> 17:38.425
family, I'd
rather not talk about it.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.795
I can't believe
I missed her funeral.

17:40.828 --> 17:43.698
It was nice, but I got out of
there pretty quick, and at least

17:43.731 --> 17:45.567
you're here now. Marietta's been

17:45.600 --> 17:48.435
delayed out
of Atlanta three times.

17:49.737 --> 17:53.240
That's terrible luck.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.645
Not really.

18:01.616 --> 18:04.586
She owns the plane.

18:25.807 --> 18:27.307
Thank you.

18:27.341 --> 18:29.577
June, glad you're here.

18:29.611 --> 18:31.546
Mildred, how are you?

18:31.579 --> 18:34.147
I'm sorry
I'm late, this is Cotton.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.183
He's an old friend.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.520
Good. That was the Inspector.

18:39.554 --> 18:41.154
How did it go?

18:41.188 --> 18:43.791
It could've
been worse, but he signed off

18:43.825 --> 18:46.694
and our finals
at the end of the week.

18:46.728 --> 18:48.796
What is this place?

18:48.830 --> 18:50.464
Well, Mildred and I have spent

18:50.497 --> 18:52.834
the last eight months
renovating this old house.

18:52.867 --> 18:54.869
The state was
off-loading them, hell half of

18:54.902 --> 18:56.638
them will have
to be torn down either way,

18:56.671 --> 19:01.308
but soon,
this will be our shop.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.611
I don't get it. A shop for what?

19:03.645 --> 19:07.715
Um, how old of
friends, did you say?

19:08.883 --> 19:11.451
I've been away.

19:11.485 --> 19:12.854
Cotton.

19:12.887 --> 19:14.956
Weatherly, I
haven't seen you since-

19:14.989 --> 19:16.758
Since the ball.

19:16.791 --> 19:18.492
Hm, yes.

19:18.526 --> 19:21.228
I see you've grown.

19:21.529 --> 19:23.263
I thought I
recognized that voice.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.264
Ah Fitzy.

19:25.733 --> 19:27.969
Mildred, thank you.

19:28.002 --> 19:29.971
Drinks on me, soon.

19:30.004 --> 19:31.506
Great to see you old friend.

19:31.539 --> 19:32.974
Good to see you.

19:33.007 --> 19:35.877
Now this is a sight!

19:35.910 --> 19:40.515
Mmhm. June's latest
design. Stunning, of course.

19:40.548 --> 19:41.949
Did we get the alpaca?

19:41.983 --> 19:43.483
As promised.

19:43.518 --> 19:45.452
Oh, have you
read much about Alpaca?

19:45.485 --> 19:46.453
A thing or two.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.322
Apparently it's hypoallergenic.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.726
Alright, turn around.

19:53.027 --> 19:55.697
Right.

20:09.744 --> 20:12.379
Is he alright?

20:13.548 --> 20:18.553
You
know, I'm not entirely sure.

20:19.053 --> 20:22.222
Hm.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.934
Did you read
the Times this morning?

20:32.967 --> 20:34.902
I did.

20:34.936 --> 20:38.305
Bit macabre, if you ask me.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.908
These
times certainly are, Ma'am.

20:40.942 --> 20:45.813
You know, I've
missed entertaining, Aesop.

20:45.847 --> 20:49.817
This morning, the funeral,

20:49.851 --> 20:54.856
it almost felt, like old times.

21:03.030 --> 21:05.633
I can't
believe you ended up back here.

21:05.666 --> 21:08.703
Well I considered
New York, even LA.

21:08.736 --> 21:11.572
But I found that if you held

21:11.606 --> 21:14.509
the door open for someone in New
York they looked at you like you

21:14.542 --> 21:18.613
were crazy. You hold the
door open for someone in LA,

21:19.247 --> 21:22.083
they don't look at you at all.

21:22.116 --> 21:25.452
I'm gonna use that someday.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.529
Be darlings, would you, grab my

21:34.562 --> 21:36.931
bags and pay the man.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.537
I'll
be staying in the Green Room.

21:42.570 --> 21:45.472
Old age? That's just something

21:45.506 --> 21:48.676
people say,
Mother. What killed her?

21:48.709 --> 21:50.812
Ugh. Does it matter, Marietta?

21:50.845 --> 21:54.782
Yes. Could be hereditary.

22:08.896 --> 22:13.835
I'm worried about Cotton.
You know how close they were.

22:13.868 --> 22:16.804
The woman coddled him.

22:16.838 --> 22:19.774
Any word from my
other illustrious brother.

22:19.807 --> 22:22.409
No. Louise is here, though.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.546
Huh,
came to collect, no doubt.

22:25.580 --> 22:27.682
How are things at The Times.

22:27.715 --> 22:29.482
Well, if I cared, I'd ask.

22:29.517 --> 22:31.384
The paper's always
been the mens' game.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.453
You know that
better than anyone.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.989
Any word from the Lawyer?

22:35.022 --> 22:36.991
Apparently all beneficiaries

22:37.024 --> 22:38.526
must be present at time of

22:38.559 --> 22:41.428
disclosure,
less they have since departed.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.864
What does that mean?

22:42.897 --> 22:44.899
It means we better hope your

22:44.932 --> 22:46.801
illustrious
brother comes home soon.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.736
And if he doesn't.

22:48.769 --> 22:51.471
Well, I
hadn't thought of it.

22:52.106 --> 22:55.042
We should probably
have him declared dead.

23:08.689 --> 23:11.626
Miss June took the liberty of
hanging out your scarlets.

23:11.659 --> 23:14.028
In case you're up
for a ride in the morning.

23:14.061 --> 23:17.430
Oh! I love this coat.

23:19.166 --> 23:21.002
Where is she?

23:21.035 --> 23:23.436
Retired for the evening.

23:25.206 --> 23:26.974
I prepared the
living room for you.

23:27.008 --> 23:28.576
What?

23:28.609 --> 23:30.211
Are all the others are taken?

23:30.244 --> 23:31.879
What about the yellow room?

23:31.913 --> 23:33.547
Under renovation.

23:33.581 --> 23:35.049
Still?

23:35.082 --> 23:36.817
I'm afraid so.

23:42.623 --> 23:46.627
This is what rock
bottom feels like, Aesop.

23:46.661 --> 23:49.563
I highly
doubt that, sir.

23:52.233 --> 23:54.802
Aesop?

23:56.637 --> 23:58.606
Sir?

23:58.639 --> 24:03.077
Did you... raise me?

24:03.110 --> 24:07.480
I tried. Sir.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.091
She's not exactly
solid in the saddle.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.093
You're not exactly
solid in the saddle.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.094
Hm?

24:20.127 --> 24:22.096
What?

24:22.129 --> 24:23.798
That mare is lovely though.

24:23.831 --> 24:26.100
She's new.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.635
I know.

24:27.668 --> 24:31.172
And then he said,
there are no virgins left in the county!

24:34.141 --> 24:38.079
Well, well, well, so,

24:38.112 --> 24:41.048
the prodigal son returns.

24:43.084 --> 24:44.251
Excuse me, Gentlemen.

24:44.285 --> 24:47.755
I'm just gonna see if I can
squeeze out of these boots.

24:50.758 --> 24:54.528
My condolences to the Family.

24:55.029 --> 24:59.499
Viola, she was
one hell of a woman.

24:59.867 --> 25:01.669
She was
definitely something else.

25:01.702 --> 25:06.574
Yeah. Cotton,
I must say, we are-

25:06.607 --> 25:09.844
we are very anxious
for your elucidation.

25:09.877 --> 25:13.614
What? Oh, the Order.

25:13.647 --> 25:17.018
I don't care for that anymore-

25:17.051 --> 25:20.955
Well, see
that's not the way it works.

25:20.988 --> 25:23.257
Boy.

25:23.290 --> 25:25.292
Well, in the course of cubbing,

25:25.326 --> 25:27.695
not every hound
makes it to the pack.

25:27.728 --> 25:29.163
I'm sure
they'll understand.

25:29.196 --> 25:33.901
Oh yeah, but see
this isn't sport, Cotton.

25:33.934 --> 25:37.872
There's nothin' I can
say that's gonna help you.

25:37.905 --> 25:41.709
Blood in. Blood out.

25:41.742 --> 25:45.179
I get it, Wentworth. You want
an O'Connor 'cause you want the

25:45.212 --> 25:48.282
press, but I ain't home to
take over the family business,

25:48.315 --> 25:51.185
nor pick up where we left off.

25:51.218 --> 25:56.223
Too much has changed, believe
me, you wouldn't want me.

25:59.760 --> 26:03.798
Good hunt, sir.

26:50.444 --> 26:54.048
Where is he?

26:56.217 --> 27:00.421
Somewhere along
the Limpopo River,

27:00.454 --> 27:05.059
I realized, I was the beast.

27:05.092 --> 27:08.395
You missed the funeral.

27:08.796 --> 27:13.767
Our convoy was
sidetracked in Jo-burg.

27:15.302 --> 27:19.240
I take it you
were in attendance.

27:20.007 --> 27:21.108
I was not.

27:21.142 --> 27:23.277
Well.
I believe my mother would understand.

27:23.310 --> 27:26.680
If anyone could.

27:27.014 --> 27:30.451
I knew she
was sick for sometime,

27:30.484 --> 27:33.988
hell, still hurts.

27:34.021 --> 27:36.423
Your mother seems torn up.

27:36.457 --> 27:37.992
Yes.

27:38.025 --> 27:38.893
Rather vapid.

27:38.926 --> 27:41.162
A North Carolina country

27:41.195 --> 27:44.098
gentleman
galloping after the fox.

27:46.767 --> 27:49.770
Never understood that tradition.

27:49.803 --> 27:53.240
Good lookin'
coats, but no armament.

27:53.274 --> 27:56.310
Not every
situation requires a bullet.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.312
What's it been?

27:58.345 --> 28:01.782
Jesus, three years.

28:01.815 --> 28:04.185
You should come
down to The Times.

28:04.218 --> 28:06.320
Look, you would
hardly recognize the place.

28:06.353 --> 28:10.457
I'm sure it's
doin' fine without me.

28:10.691 --> 28:13.194
Your Great Great
Grandfather, Arthur Niall-

28:13.227 --> 28:18.332
I know the story, Dad.

28:18.365 --> 28:21.202
What did I ever do to you?

28:21.235 --> 28:23.505
You wouldn't let
me write for the paper.

28:23.538 --> 28:24.338
You were
under-qualified.

28:24.371 --> 28:25.339
We own it!

28:25.372 --> 28:29.109
We're publishers!

28:29.710 --> 28:34.315
You made everything
so hard on everyone.

28:35.182 --> 28:37.051
You killed my dog.

28:37.084 --> 28:41.288
It was a family dog.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.859
So you admit it?

29:04.411 --> 29:07.881
Meanwhile...

29:47.622 --> 29:50.824
That was in!

29:50.858 --> 29:52.393
Thank you.

29:58.465 --> 30:00.968
Well, I played well.

30:01.001 --> 30:04.238
I let you win.

30:04.471 --> 30:07.241
Look at these bitches.

30:07.274 --> 30:09.443
Staring at us.

30:09.476 --> 30:12.446
"There she is.
The silver spoon queen, still

30:12.479 --> 30:14.448
hasn't married you know, and the

30:14.481 --> 30:18.452
other one who so badly
wants to be an O'Connor."

30:18.653 --> 30:22.923
Please, child.
That's what they're saying.

30:22.956 --> 30:26.460
They're probably talking about
Cotton. Your family's chaos is

30:26.493 --> 30:28.162
regular chatter on an off-day.

30:28.195 --> 30:29.463
Especially now that he's home.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.465
Cotton? What a dunce.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.267
He's your brother.

30:33.300 --> 30:34.968
Only by blood.

30:35.002 --> 30:37.171
Do you think he'll take
Whitman's place at the paper,

30:37.204 --> 30:40.274
now that he's back.

30:40.307 --> 30:43.545
As future Publisher?

30:43.578 --> 30:47.014
I know you
harbor some deep-seeded love for

30:47.047 --> 30:49.584
the boy, but you
must stop encouraging him.

30:49.617 --> 30:52.019
It's not healthy.

30:52.052 --> 30:55.422
Relationship advice from
the single, silver spoon queen?

30:55.456 --> 30:58.959
Single?
I've been married for six years.

30:58.992 --> 31:03.063
Susan is the best
thing that ever happened to me.

31:03.097 --> 31:06.100
Christ, June.

31:06.133 --> 31:10.605
You can certainly
smoke 'til you're twenty five.

31:13.006 --> 31:18.011
After that, it's just sad.

31:29.289 --> 31:33.528
Give
it to me straight, old friend.

31:33.561 --> 31:37.599
My lady gettin' out there?

31:40.568 --> 31:44.204
There have been
quite a few inquiries, sir.

31:44.238 --> 31:46.508
A date or two.

31:46.541 --> 31:49.109
Flowers every Thursday.

31:49.143 --> 31:54.148
Thursdays!
Son of a bitch.

31:54.381 --> 31:59.386
And you, are you,
getting out there Sir?

32:00.220 --> 32:05.125
In so many ways, Aesop.

32:07.428 --> 32:12.166
Your mother was one of the
sharpest women I have ever had

32:12.199 --> 32:17.204
the pleasure of knowing.
She lived with rare grace.

32:18.673 --> 32:23.678
Yeah. Can't really
believe she snuffed it.

32:26.180 --> 32:29.316
Thought the old
dame would outlive us all.

32:29.349 --> 32:33.588
Indeed.

32:37.625 --> 32:39.627
So,

32:42.129 --> 32:46.300
what are we
gonna do about these flowers.

32:53.440 --> 32:57.377
Best to put them in vases, Sir.

33:07.722 --> 33:09.423
Oh! I'm sorry, Louise.

33:09.456 --> 33:14.461
No, no, June. Sit
with me, won't you?

33:25.272 --> 33:26.674
Hmmm, what is that?

33:26.708 --> 33:31.144
Lavender. I'm
practically addicted to it.

33:31.178 --> 33:35.750
My therapist suggested
it to me after Whitman left.

33:36.551 --> 33:38.686
Apparently,
it's good for stress.

33:42.256 --> 33:43.591
Is everything-

33:43.625 --> 33:47.795
I slept with... someone.

33:47.829 --> 33:50.832
Hey, good for you lady.

33:50.865 --> 33:52.534
It's nothin' to be ashamed of.

33:52.567 --> 33:55.402
Oh, no, I'm not.

33:55.435 --> 33:59.774
Though, I had
only ever been with Whitman.

33:59.807 --> 34:02.242
Oh hell, Louise
it's not my place,

34:02.276 --> 34:04.746
but no one else is sayin' it.

34:04.779 --> 34:08.415
Fuck him.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.617
Fuck him?

34:09.650 --> 34:11.251
Fuck him!

34:11.284 --> 34:15.222
Why should you
have to do or say a damn thing.

34:15.255 --> 34:18.860
That man should
march his soggy bottom back here

34:18.893 --> 34:21.495
and grovel at
your pretty little toes.

34:21.529 --> 34:25.567
Whitman this and
Whitman that. I mean-

34:30.871 --> 34:33.808
That fool,

34:33.841 --> 34:38.713
he'd be lucky you
ever look at him straight again.

35:21.589 --> 35:22.657
Thank you Miss Moore.

35:22.690 --> 35:24.559
Let me know
if you need anything.

35:24.592 --> 35:28.730
Alright.

35:28.997 --> 35:34.201
Ah,
Mr. Wells. How are things?

35:34.502 --> 35:37.237
Just dreadful.

35:37.270 --> 35:39.306
By the time we
run with it, every online

35:39.339 --> 35:43.210
service in the world has covered
it and ten stories that we never

35:43.243 --> 35:44.746
even saw coming.

35:44.779 --> 35:48.516
Advertisement is down and that
used to be our golden river.

35:48.549 --> 35:52.654
Once and again, rivers dry up.

35:52.687 --> 35:57.725
This is not a
laughing matter, Whit.

35:57.759 --> 36:01.461
I ran papers for your
Father, when I was just a boy.

36:01.495 --> 36:03.765
The Times is an institution.

36:03.798 --> 36:08.435
And it always
will be. Oh by the way,

36:08.468 --> 36:12.607
Edwin McCushing
is gonna be dropping by.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.642
McCushing.

36:15.943 --> 36:17.912
Why, does
he want his old job back?

36:17.945 --> 36:22.282
No, it's more
of a-a gentleman's visit.

36:22.315 --> 36:25.485
Guys like McCushing are diggin'
our graves, even as we speak.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.688
You know that, right.

36:26.721 --> 36:29.757
Well,
somebody's gotta tend to that.

36:29.791 --> 36:33.761
Just be nice
to the man. That's all.

36:33.795 --> 36:38.465
I trust you'll do right by us,
when the time comes, Whit.

36:49.677 --> 36:53.815
Apparently the
piano player's blind.

36:53.848 --> 36:55.315
Blind?

36:55.348 --> 36:57.985
Well,
he's no Beethoven.

36:58.019 --> 37:01.756
Beethoven was deaf my dear.

37:01.789 --> 37:04.324
Ha! I knew that, of course.

37:04.357 --> 37:05.526
I blame the gimlets!

37:05.560 --> 37:09.463
Uh, potent, as always.

37:09.496 --> 37:12.600
Fitzy, shoots for
The Times, now, you know.

37:12.633 --> 37:14.702
Well, I like to think the
paper works for me, I'm still

37:14.736 --> 37:18.271
freelance. Speaking of which
I understand your pops was

37:18.305 --> 37:20.440
thinking of sellin' out, Cotton.

37:20.474 --> 37:22.877
He'll take the
paper to his grave.

37:22.910 --> 37:25.378
Well, it's good to
have you back Cotton.

37:25.412 --> 37:28.750
I imagine you've been
out there, like Kerouac.

37:28.783 --> 37:31.018
Lost in the American terrain.

37:31.052 --> 37:34.956
I think of myself
as more of a Huck Finn.

37:34.989 --> 37:37.825
You're too predictable
to be a Huck Finn!

37:37.859 --> 37:40.561
You're more like a Tom.
I would be Huck.

37:40.595 --> 37:44.532
Who am I?
And don't you dare say Jim.

37:45.533 --> 37:46.901
Don't you
run away from this!

37:46.934 --> 37:49.537
I'll be back.

37:49.570 --> 37:51.539
You were gonna
say it, weren't you.

38:43.124 --> 38:45.092
You
disappeared on us, back there-

38:45.126 --> 38:48.095
June! Remember when we used to

38:48.129 --> 38:51.966
put on plays
here for our Families.

38:51.999 --> 38:55.703
I miss this.
Reminds me of simpler times.

38:56.637 --> 39:00.775
They certainly
seemed that way.

39:00.808 --> 39:04.011
What's that?

39:04.045 --> 39:07.882
Grandmother's copy of my novel.

39:08.616 --> 39:13.353
Ah, I was thinking, might
be better suited as a play.

39:14.155 --> 39:18.559
I think, It'd
be best suited in a jacket.

39:38.045 --> 39:40.748
I had such a
vivid image of you in my head

39:40.781 --> 39:42.884
these last three years.

39:46.053 --> 39:49.924
You're
much softer than I recall.

39:49.957 --> 39:53.460
And you...

40:03.938 --> 40:08.943
Well, you're certainly not the
girl you were before Paris.

40:38.606 --> 40:41.509
It must terrify you.

41:08.703 --> 41:13.507
Jesus Christ! Whitman!

41:13.541 --> 41:14.909
You know the
front door still works.

41:14.942 --> 41:17.278
I have no doubt, little brother.

41:17.311 --> 41:21.048
Who's in my
room? And why is it purple?

41:21.082 --> 41:22.583
June.

41:22.616 --> 41:25.920
What, does she live here now?

41:30.291 --> 41:32.059
You missed Lily's debut.

41:32.093 --> 41:33.995
Debut?

41:34.028 --> 41:37.531
That must
have been some time ago.

41:38.966 --> 41:42.036
How'd she look?

41:42.069 --> 41:44.939
Disappointed.

41:44.972 --> 41:49.777
What about Grandmother? I
assumed that's why you're here.

41:49.810 --> 41:53.280
Right.

41:53.314 --> 41:56.150
How'd she go, anyway?

41:56.183 --> 41:58.219
Does it matter?

41:58.252 --> 41:59.453
S'pose not.

41:59.487 --> 42:03.324
Wait, you can't leave. We need
you here for the reading of the

42:03.357 --> 42:07.061
will, or some shit.

42:07.094 --> 42:11.599
Damn. Well, I
can't simply be here

42:11.632 --> 42:15.903
when everyone wakes up. That's
no way to make an entrance.

42:15.936 --> 42:20.274
True, the
window was bold.

42:20.307 --> 42:22.910
I ain't
sticking around after.

42:22.943 --> 42:27.114
I doubt anyone expects you to.

42:42.063 --> 42:47.001
She was one of the good
ones, wasn't she? Grandmother?

42:56.077 --> 43:00.014
I never read your
novel, by the way.

43:00.047 --> 43:02.116
I never finished it.

43:43.190 --> 43:46.894
What's
the deal with the pool, Lily?

43:46.927 --> 43:49.964
Apparently, its gone to shit.

43:59.807 --> 44:02.109
It was the
middle of the night.

44:02.143 --> 44:05.246
We could hear
the leopards breathing.

44:05.279 --> 44:07.915
Smell their breath.

44:07.948 --> 44:10.417
I readied my spear.

44:10.451 --> 44:14.989
It was the only time I've
ever been truly afraid.

44:15.189 --> 44:18.292
He pounced, and
I struck, caught-

44:18.325 --> 44:21.795
Atrocious! What'd you do if
someone were to hunt you.

44:21.829 --> 44:24.832
Haha! I would welcome the sport.

44:24.865 --> 44:26.200
Enough Whitman.

44:26.233 --> 44:29.036
I doubt our guest wants
to hear all those gory details.

44:29.069 --> 44:31.372
Why don't you save
them for your journals.

44:31.405 --> 44:33.174
Or the paper.

44:33.774 --> 44:35.943
I think readers would
respond to your adventures.

44:35.976 --> 44:37.845
It's not all
curtains and cocktails.

44:37.878 --> 44:39.313
Why wouldn't they?

44:39.346 --> 44:41.882
Teddy Roosevelt
was a hunter. Churchill.

44:41.916 --> 44:42.883
Hemingway.

44:42.917 --> 44:44.919
Aldo Leopold.

44:48.923 --> 44:51.458
Aesop, the quail, are they
farm-raised or from one of my

44:51.492 --> 44:53.127
husband's many exploits?

44:53.160 --> 44:54.128
Farm, ma'am.

44:54.161 --> 44:55.262
Oh! Thank goodness.

44:55.296 --> 44:57.798
The last time I
had quail, I spent the

44:57.831 --> 45:00.301
entire morning pickin'
buckshot outta my teeth.

45:12.514 --> 45:13.914
What are you still doing here?

45:13.948 --> 45:16.784
Manners, Cotton. I've offered

45:16.817 --> 45:18.819
Mr. McCushing
stay during his visit.

45:18.852 --> 45:21.388
He and your Father used to
work side by side at the paper.

45:21.422 --> 45:24.191
Edwin, please. I remember you.

45:24.225 --> 45:26.227
You were just
a child at the time.

45:26.994 --> 45:28.495
In what room.

45:29.396 --> 45:30.898
I'm sorry?

45:32.333 --> 45:35.903
In what room
is Edwin staying in?

45:35.936 --> 45:37.505
Oh, the yellow room.

45:37.539 --> 45:38.973
But the renovations?

45:39.006 --> 45:40.941
Completed first
thing this morning.

45:40.975 --> 45:44.845
Aesop, nothing brings me
home like your egg scramble.

45:44.878 --> 45:48.516
I haven't had a
proper brunch in ages.

45:48.550 --> 45:50.784
I'm not leaving this
time without your secret.

45:50.818 --> 45:52.219
What secret is that, Marietta?

45:52.253 --> 45:54.154
How to break an egg?

45:55.422 --> 45:58.526
You know what,
join us, Aesop.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.294
Cotton.

46:00.327 --> 46:01.962
Perhaps another time.

46:01.996 --> 46:04.331
Nonsense, take my chair.

46:04.365 --> 46:07.101
Is this about the yellow room?

46:07.134 --> 46:09.303
No, this isn't
about the yellow room,

46:09.336 --> 46:11.438
though that is unfortunate.

46:11.472 --> 46:14.208
Mother, you,
yourself said Aesop is family.

46:14.241 --> 46:17.444
I believe I said, practically.

46:18.145 --> 46:19.547
Whitman?

46:23.917 --> 46:25.319
I'd, uh, ask for a seat,

46:25.352 --> 46:27.288
but they seem
slim-to-none at this table.

46:45.005 --> 46:46.574
You look
amazing, Lou.

46:47.509 --> 46:49.376
Don't start with that.

46:49.611 --> 46:51.979
Ok. You go first.

47:01.488 --> 47:04.091
How did you
hear about your Grandmother?

47:04.992 --> 47:07.194
Cotton, of course.

47:11.599 --> 47:13.400
How's Lily?

47:14.902 --> 47:17.438
She graduates in the spring.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.408
Hm, our little girl.

47:21.442 --> 47:23.477
She's twenty one.

47:24.111 --> 47:26.413
I'll have to
buy her a drink then.

47:29.116 --> 47:30.451
What's she studying?

47:30.719 --> 47:33.253
Like you give a damn!

47:46.501 --> 47:49.370
You really
do look amazing though.

48:05.687 --> 48:08.956
This doesn't change anything.

48:29.309 --> 48:31.445
You don't smoke.

48:37.384 --> 48:40.688
Where is she, Whitman?

48:44.091 --> 48:47.961
Havana. With her family.

48:50.732 --> 48:53.267
She went the one
place you couldn't follow.

48:54.669 --> 48:57.104
Smart girl.

48:59.406 --> 49:04.011
Well, relations with
Cuba are better than ever.

49:07.281 --> 49:08.982
Lucky you.

49:15.790 --> 49:18.025
What?

49:19.092 --> 49:21.261
Just looking at you.

49:21.295 --> 49:23.096
I look old.

49:26.200 --> 49:29.036
I'd blame myself,
if that were true.

49:31.305 --> 49:33.207
I can't
imagine that you would take the

49:33.240 --> 49:35.476
blame for much of anything.

49:37.411 --> 49:41.315
Fair shot. What else you got.

49:41.783 --> 49:46.253
Sit down or leave.
I have no energy for this.

49:46.286 --> 49:48.422
Come on, Lou.

49:51.258 --> 49:53.695
You know, I never should have

49:53.728 --> 49:56.463
said yes to
your foolish proposal.

49:56.664 --> 49:58.566
Foolish?

49:58.600 --> 50:00.367
I was knocked up, at the time.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.436
I was proud of that.

50:03.805 --> 50:04.772
Is that right?

50:04.806 --> 50:07.775
Yeah.

50:07.809 --> 50:09.309
And was it pride that drove

50:09.343 --> 50:12.045
you away the
second time around?

50:34.836 --> 50:36.671
She hates me.

50:37.605 --> 50:38.806
She doesn't hate you.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.375
I don't blame her.

50:41.408 --> 50:44.311
No, I suppose you can't.

50:45.479 --> 50:48.348
Anything you'd
like to get off your chest.

50:50.250 --> 50:53.621
Why, what did she say?

51:00.862 --> 51:04.832
Look, Nancy,
you get the contents of this library, all

51:04.866 --> 51:07.301
her gowns and jewelry,
except for three rings.

51:07.535 --> 51:10.103
The
sapphire for Marietta, the

51:10.137 --> 51:15.108
white gold for Whitman the Fifth
and Cotton, you get the diamond.

51:15.142 --> 51:16.878
The Manor on Bloodworth Avenue

51:16.911 --> 51:19.581
is yours, Whitman,
and the house in Nag's Head,

51:19.614 --> 51:22.617
will be
sold for conservation purposes.

51:22.650 --> 51:25.152
Conservation?

51:25.352 --> 51:28.455
Aesop. How'd she put it,

51:29.289 --> 51:33.460
"To my dear friend, Aesop, I
leave a sum of twenty-three

51:33.493 --> 51:38.098
thousand dollars and twelve
acres off Peach Orchard Road."

51:40.535 --> 51:43.871
Is that it? What of The Times?

51:43.905 --> 51:45.873
Viola sold her shares-

51:45.907 --> 51:48.876
It's all quite confidential,

51:48.910 --> 51:52.479
but, but uh,

51:52.513 --> 51:56.718
since we're all family here.

52:00.487 --> 52:02.289
Lily.

52:02.322 --> 52:04.692
Children.

52:04.926 --> 52:07.260
My love.

52:07.662 --> 52:10.430
Aesop.

52:10.732 --> 52:14.669
I'm selling,
The Carolina Times.

52:15.703 --> 52:17.705
The hell you are.

52:17.739 --> 52:19.507
At what price?

52:19.540 --> 52:22.309
Mr. McCushing is here
to appraise the business.

52:22.342 --> 52:23.243
Edwin?

52:23.276 --> 52:26.581
Yes, after leaving
The Times, years ago,

52:26.614 --> 52:29.249
he took the lead role
over at Dagger Digital.

52:29.282 --> 52:30.818
That's my paper.

52:30.852 --> 52:32.219
Your paper?

52:32.252 --> 52:33.921
Yeah!

52:33.955 --> 52:35.790
You're a publisher,
your father was a publisher,

52:35.823 --> 52:36.924
his father was
a publisher, his fath-

52:36.958 --> 52:40.260
His father was a ship
builder! What have you built.

52:40.293 --> 52:42.930
You would
really abandon it so easily?

52:42.964 --> 52:47.669
I assure you there
is nothing easy about it.

52:47.702 --> 52:51.405
The peo-the
people depend on us.

52:51.438 --> 52:52.640
For what?

52:52.674 --> 52:53.641
The Truth!

52:53.675 --> 52:54.809
The Truth. In the news?

52:54.842 --> 52:55.610
Yeah!

52:55.643 --> 52:59.379
You'd have
better luck finding God.

53:02.984 --> 53:04.217
Cotton!

53:04.251 --> 53:09.189
Look, Viola wanted you to have
this. I'm sorry for your loss.

53:09.757 --> 53:14.662
She was... well, you know.

53:21.002 --> 53:22.970
I'm surprised
they took it like that.

53:23.004 --> 53:25.707
They all stand to
make quite a bit of money.

53:27.608 --> 53:30.578
Give Marietta
a dollar, she'll save it.

53:30.611 --> 53:32.980
Whitman? He'll lose it.

53:33.014 --> 53:37.518
And give Cotton
a dollar, he'll spend two.

53:37.552 --> 53:40.888
I'm not sure when they
became so goddamned entitled.

53:40.922 --> 53:43.356
They'll come around.

53:44.257 --> 53:47.862
It's not them I'm worried
about to tell you the truth.

53:48.830 --> 53:52.533
What am I gonna say to everybody
out there on the floor.

53:52.567 --> 53:56.637
Well, the sooner the
better I say. No one wants to

53:56.671 --> 54:00.675
find out their captain's jumped
ship by watchin' him swim away.

54:01.241 --> 54:02.710
I'm just glad knowing that

54:02.744 --> 54:06.480
those, those presses
are gonna keep on rollin'.

54:07.314 --> 54:09.349
You gotta be kidding me.

54:09.382 --> 54:11.686
Those archaic machines are gonna
be the first thing that go.

54:11.719 --> 54:12.887
Hey.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.722
Hi. Your photographer is here.

54:14.756 --> 54:19.259
What, oh, of course, um,
sure, where do you want us.

54:20.595 --> 54:24.397
Well, I say we keep it
simple. How about by the couch?

54:24.732 --> 54:26.033
Did I miss it?

54:26.067 --> 54:27.502
Not a thing, Mr. Wells.

54:27.535 --> 54:30.671
Good, good. Well uh,
ol' Fitz here's the best.

54:30.705 --> 54:32.807
I think we've bought a
couple negatives, ourselves.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.341
Really? Who are you with?

54:34.374 --> 54:35.408
Dagger.

54:35.442 --> 54:36.644
Dagger... Digital?

54:36.677 --> 54:37.678
Yeah.

54:37.712 --> 54:41.916
Alright, gentlemen.
Let's get this over with.

54:42.282 --> 54:44.519
Old man O'Connor would be proud.

54:44.552 --> 54:47.922
Yep, well, some people will
bitch and moan, but at least

54:47.955 --> 54:50.792
they will have a
newspaper in the morning.

54:50.825 --> 54:53.493
That's great,
gentlemen, thank you.

54:54.729 --> 54:56.731
Alright, well, uh, boys I'm off.

54:56.764 --> 54:57.732
I'll walk out with ya.

54:57.765 --> 54:58.966
Alright.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.503
I will have those papers on your
desk by the end of the week.

55:09.811 --> 55:12.947
I take it, you'll be discreet.

55:12.980 --> 55:15.850
I hear nothing Mr. O'Connor.

55:15.883 --> 55:19.987
May I ask you a question
it-it's Fitzgerald, right?

55:20.021 --> 55:22.924
Yes that's right. Fire away.

55:24.659 --> 55:28.963
Do you think the
world will remember us?

55:28.996 --> 55:31.431
Long from now.

55:31.464 --> 55:33.935
The Times?

55:34.936 --> 55:37.505
That's hard to say.

55:37.538 --> 55:40.875
You know, the paper, as much as
the film in the camera, has told

55:40.908 --> 55:45.913
our story for over a hundred
years, but things change.

55:46.147 --> 55:49.784
It may not be on fiber,
or celluloid, Mr. O'Connor,

55:50.785 --> 55:53.921
but our story, will continue.

55:55.556 --> 55:58.726
So... it's forgotten.

55:59.527 --> 56:02.897
You know, they say the Earth
will be engulfed by the flames

56:02.930 --> 56:05.465
of the Sun someday,

56:05.498 --> 56:08.468
but that's nothing
to fuss over right now.

56:20.948 --> 56:24.384
Hi baby.

56:30.157 --> 56:32.660
Hey.

56:34.862 --> 56:38.833
Damn, I remember
when we bought you this horse.

56:41.802 --> 56:45.006
It's not the same horse.

57:04.692 --> 57:07.194
My sweet gentleman.

57:07.228 --> 57:09.730
I'm sure this
must be hard for you.

57:09.764 --> 57:12.600
You've always been
such a sensitive young man.

57:12.633 --> 57:17.204
I always loved those plays you
and June put on in the attic,

57:17.238 --> 57:20.808
Your paintings were
inspiring and your novel.

57:20.841 --> 57:23.778
I believe I finally understand.

57:23.811 --> 57:27.081
It's about us. The Family.

57:27.114 --> 57:31.484
Bit harsh, though I
suppose it is a fair portrait.

57:31.519 --> 57:34.255
I imagine it wasn't easy being
raised in the shadow of your

57:34.288 --> 57:37.224
brother, or The Times,

57:37.258 --> 57:40.127
but I
want you to know, there have

57:40.161 --> 57:43.831
been many Whitman's, Cotton,
but there's only one you.

57:44.732 --> 57:49.136
And I love you, for all that
you are, and will come to be.

57:50.271 --> 57:53.507
Goodbye, sweet boy.

57:59.880 --> 58:03.951
What's on
Peach Orchard Rd, Aesop?

58:05.686 --> 58:07.254
My wife.

58:07.288 --> 58:09.123
My children.

58:09.156 --> 58:11.859
Three Grandchildren.

58:12.159 --> 58:14.128
The sum covers the deed,

58:14.161 --> 58:17.497
I've been buying it from her.

58:17.798 --> 58:20.601
What are they like?

58:21.302 --> 58:24.238
They get on just fine.

58:24.271 --> 58:27.875
What are you still doing here?

58:27.908 --> 58:30.878
There's nothing left
but a pack of wolves.

58:30.911 --> 58:34.915
And you. Are you a wolf?

58:39.320 --> 58:41.288
I'm a sheep in wolves' clothing.

58:41.322 --> 58:42.890
Pull!

58:47.795 --> 58:50.798
Nice shooting, Sir.

58:51.465 --> 58:54.902
Don't ever
call me that, again.

59:08.349 --> 59:09.417
Whitman?

59:09.450 --> 59:12.319
You and I have never
really seen eye to eye, have we?

59:12.353 --> 59:15.623
Hard to teach anything
to a man who knows everything.

59:15.656 --> 59:18.859
Yeah, okay, enough
of the wisdom, old man.

59:18.893 --> 59:20.127
What do you want.

59:20.161 --> 59:22.930
Father. He's
not thinking straight.

59:22.963 --> 59:25.199
No worse than usual.

59:25.232 --> 59:27.201
I'm challenging the sale.

59:27.234 --> 59:28.702
I want to
make sure you're on our side,

59:28.736 --> 59:30.704
when this all shakes out.

59:30.738 --> 59:35.009
Selling the Times
could ruin this family.

59:35.743 --> 59:38.679
If you say so.

59:39.380 --> 59:42.216
Okay.

59:42.249 --> 59:45.786
Good.

59:45.820 --> 59:48.689
Good talk.

59:48.722 --> 59:50.758
When I first
approached June two years ago

59:50.791 --> 59:53.160
with the idea
for Bloom & Thorn,

59:53.194 --> 59:55.262
she never once hesitated.

59:55.296 --> 01:00:00.000
I am
humbled and honored to be,

01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:04.371
not only your
partner, but your friend.

01:00:04.405 --> 01:00:05.739
To June.

01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:07.241
To June!

01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:09.743
Thank you.

01:00:37.438 --> 01:00:41.976
Damn, this place.

01:00:43.844 --> 01:00:47.181
Real proud of you, June.

01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:50.718
Okay.

01:00:51.986 --> 01:00:55.656
What is it?

01:00:59.994 --> 01:01:03.664
They're sellin' The Times.

01:01:04.932 --> 01:01:06.967
Goodnight y'all.

01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:08.869
June!

01:01:08.903 --> 01:01:11.972
Goodnight.

01:01:31.825 --> 01:01:35.996
Before you left, you stood tall.

01:01:36.665 --> 01:01:41.168
Puff out your chest to let
us all know you're comin'.

01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:45.706
But, now you're like
me, when I first came back.

01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:49.977
Disenchanted.

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:05.359
What about us?

01:02:07.895 --> 01:02:10.764
Cotton O'Connor.

01:02:10.798 --> 01:02:14.034
A
thousand times we had a chance.

01:02:14.068 --> 01:02:17.371
You let every
one of them blow on by.

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:33.874
You know you're Grandfather gave
me that bottle, years ago.

01:04:39.279 --> 01:04:42.650
Did you know him well?

01:04:42.684 --> 01:04:46.654
As well as
anybody could, I guess.

01:04:46.688 --> 01:04:50.090
Oh, he lived for the paper.

01:04:55.396 --> 01:04:57.898
They're selling it.

01:04:58.566 --> 01:05:01.368
In certain circles

01:05:01.402 --> 01:05:04.371
voting is
done by, uh, placing small

01:05:04.405 --> 01:05:08.175
marbles,
black and white, into a jar.

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:12.146
Now, if one is to receive
just one black marble the

01:05:12.179 --> 01:05:16.083
inductee is denied.

01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:18.218
I took a chance on you.

01:05:18.252 --> 01:05:22.322
And I removed a
black marble from your jar.

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:27.529
Why?

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:31.699
"There is a place you never see.

01:05:31.733 --> 01:05:34.401
A place of
endless fields of gold,

01:05:34.435 --> 01:05:38.573
shrouded
by uplifting pines.

01:05:38.606 --> 01:05:41.175
Caught between sinking

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:45.580
mountains
and drifting sand dunes.

01:05:45.613 --> 01:05:49.283
A place where fallen
tobacco barns lie alongside

01:05:51.452 --> 01:05:56.457
quiet country roads like fallen
giants from some forgotten war.

01:05:59.761 --> 01:06:03.631
A place I love and you would too

01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:09.637
if you had come
to know it as I have."

01:06:14.776 --> 01:06:17.277
You read my short story.

01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:21.114
Many times.

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:25.486
We never
wanted you for the paper Cotton.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:30.290
You see the Order is old and,
let me tell you, it is as tired

01:06:30.324 --> 01:06:33.260
as it is aged.

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:37.130
I just thought
there would be young men,

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:41.301
like you, who'd be next in line.

01:06:45.172 --> 01:06:49.209
But you know it's
all just slipping away.

01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:56.784
Perhaps it should.

01:06:56.818 --> 01:06:59.654
You know what your trouble is?

01:06:59.687 --> 01:07:04.692
You like to romanticize about
the way things were.

01:07:05.827 --> 01:07:07.461
But the
truth is you don't want to

01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:09.797
have anything to do with it.

01:07:09.831 --> 01:07:14.034
Oh you
dress the part, but Cotton,

01:07:14.836 --> 01:07:19.373
your heart, it's your
heart that knows better.

01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:27.447
Oh.

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:35.389
You're
not a bad guy, Cotton.

01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:39.459
You're just not
one of the hounds of dixie.

01:07:40.193 --> 01:07:44.398
Now, my advice,
drop the act. Just be you.

01:07:48.235 --> 01:07:50.370
But what's the point?

01:07:50.404 --> 01:07:53.073
I've been
chasing this novel for years.

01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:55.710
And still have
nothing to show for it,

01:07:55.743 --> 01:07:56.844
no real story to tell.

01:07:56.878 --> 01:08:00.380
Oh, I don't believe that.

01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:05.085
Perhaps your novel
has been with you all along.

01:08:05.887 --> 01:08:07.855
How's that?

01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:11.559
Cotton, you know these
hunts we cherish so dearly?

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.861
Well let
me ask you something.

01:08:13.895 --> 01:08:17.497
Have you ever
actually seen a fox?

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:20.100
Can't say that I have.

01:08:20.133 --> 01:08:25.104
Well Cotton, that's because
there are no foxes out there.

01:08:25.673 --> 01:08:27.575
Not anymore.

01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:32.613
We killed them all.

01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:13.921
My name is
Cotton O'Connor.

01:09:13.955 --> 01:09:17.658
I'm a newspaperman
by birth, an outcast by the pen.

01:09:17.692 --> 01:09:20.627
I have seen
much of the world, great walls

01:09:20.662 --> 01:09:24.932
over ancient lands, romantic
spires down the Rues of France.

01:09:24.966 --> 01:09:26.166
Felt the rumble of hooves at the

01:09:26.198 --> 01:09:29.671
great corrida in Pamplona, lost
everything along the tracks of

01:09:29.703 --> 01:09:32.939
the Curragh, only to make it back
in the dingiest dives of Calcutta.

01:09:33.975 --> 01:09:35.943
I have sailed, not drifted

01:09:35.977 --> 01:09:38.211
down the peaceful,
but on the hardest seas

01:09:38.245 --> 01:09:39.846
on the other side of the Earth.

01:09:39.881 --> 01:09:42.684
I believe I was chasing
something, but standing at the

01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:45.853
foot of Kilimanjaro
I realized I was running,

01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:50.390
running from a name,
a place, an existence,

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:55.863
lost along the way news came
that my Grandmother had passed.

01:09:56.998 --> 01:09:59.534
We never said goodbye.

01:10:18.052 --> 01:10:20.722
When I came
home it all looked the same,

01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:22.724
but nothing
was as it would appear.

01:10:22.757 --> 01:10:25.593
My Grandmother was gone
and with her, and the wind,

01:10:25.626 --> 01:10:28.261
a whimper of a way vanished.

01:10:28.295 --> 01:10:30.998
The old South died and a new
South, one full of change and

01:10:31.032 --> 01:10:33.266
wonder stood in its place,

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.402
I could tell you
of the breeze in Dingle,

01:10:35.435 --> 01:10:36.838
or the thirst in Mumbai,

01:10:36.871 --> 01:10:39.040
or the bravery
endured in the arenas,

01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:41.408
though I am no aficionado.

01:10:41.441 --> 01:10:44.779
I will, however,
tell you of the world I know,

01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:49.684
the one I was given. Both a
curse and a blessing of manner.

01:10:49.717 --> 01:10:51.552
Where wars have been fought and

01:10:51.586 --> 01:10:54.488
loves lost and
things left unsaid,

01:10:54.522 --> 01:10:56.023
but it was not their fault.

01:10:56.057 --> 01:10:58.025
It's just the life I was given.

01:10:58.059 --> 01:11:01.028
They birthed me to
privilege, gave me everything,

01:11:01.062 --> 01:11:05.867
and in the end I'm just a man
with life at his fingertips.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.802
Too stubborn to accept it,

01:11:07.835 --> 01:11:11.939
too foolish to
clench it in his hands.

01:11:46.974 --> 01:11:49.644
It's not awful.

01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:54.549
Predictable.

01:11:54.582 --> 01:11:57.952
Forced at times.

01:11:57.985 --> 01:11:59.954
A tad
heavy handed on the homage

01:11:59.987 --> 01:12:03.323
but, not awful.

01:12:06.794 --> 01:12:09.831
I never apologized.

01:12:09.864 --> 01:12:12.733
For ruining your Ball.

01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:15.970
Yeah.

01:12:17.104 --> 01:12:20.407
Well this family was
never cut out for fairy tales.

01:12:27.548 --> 01:12:29.517
What are you gonna do?

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.986
Now, that
The Times is changing hands.

01:12:32.019 --> 01:12:33.988
I don't know.

01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:37.592
The Times
were never really mine.

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:41.095
What about you?

01:12:46.033 --> 01:12:49.704
I always thought I'd
work for the paper, someday.

01:12:51.706 --> 01:12:54.709
But I think it's good, ya know.

01:12:56.744 --> 01:13:01.481
Now we can do whatever we want.

01:13:02.717 --> 01:13:04.819
Why should
I care if he sells it?

01:13:04.852 --> 01:13:07.420
It's our heritage, Marietta.

01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:11.959
Hey.

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.098
What is your plan?

01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:18.431
I'll bring
it to the board.

01:13:18.465 --> 01:13:19.967
It sounded like a done-deal.

01:13:20.001 --> 01:13:22.036
The O'Connor name has sat
perched upon the header of every

01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:25.172
issue that's ever
gone to print for The Times.

01:13:25.206 --> 01:13:28.910
I will see
to it that it remains there.

01:13:31.512 --> 01:13:34.782
Tonight, the O'Connor Family
passes on the baton to Dagger

01:13:34.815 --> 01:13:37.785
Digital and with that,

01:13:37.818 --> 01:13:40.821
the responsibility to
seek truth in journalism.

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:44.725
Though, a wise man once said

01:13:44.759 --> 01:13:46.794
you'd have
better luck finding God.

01:13:46.827 --> 01:13:49.931
I so wish your
Grandmother was still with us.

01:13:50.231 --> 01:13:52.767
She would be proud.

01:13:56.237 --> 01:13:58.739
I know this is hard, Cotton,

01:13:58.773 --> 01:14:01.876
but this transition's
not about you and me.

01:14:01.909 --> 01:14:04.245
It's about those to come.

01:14:04.278 --> 01:14:07.081
The next generation.

01:14:07.114 --> 01:14:08.582
The faster we advance,

01:14:08.616 --> 01:14:12.219
the stronger
this world's gonna become.

01:14:12.253 --> 01:14:15.856
You must see that.

01:14:16.891 --> 01:14:21.095
Pretty soon, were gonna be
traveling at the speed of light.

01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:25.533
Two World Wars.
Civil rights. Terror.

01:14:27.535 --> 01:14:31.772
It has also seen what man
has become. Both good and evil.

01:14:31.806 --> 01:14:35.242
If our only
concern is traveling fast

01:14:35.276 --> 01:14:38.813
then we
might just forget to live.

01:14:40.815 --> 01:14:43.150
Faster than the speed of light?

01:14:48.289 --> 01:14:50.958
We might all just disappear.

01:15:36.871 --> 01:15:39.206
My Grandmother...

01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:00.895
What's this?

01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:17.845
Wait, so this isn't an apology?

01:16:18.045 --> 01:16:20.781
Lily, I'm sorry.

01:16:20.815 --> 01:16:23.717
We have the
rest of our lives to therapize

01:16:23.751 --> 01:16:25.186
with one another if need be.

01:16:25.219 --> 01:16:27.688
What is wrong with you,

01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:29.090
like, inherently?

01:16:29.123 --> 01:16:31.058
It's not me! It's
your Grandfather.

01:16:31.092 --> 01:16:33.627
He's clearly
insane and unfit to make

01:16:33.661 --> 01:16:35.696
decisions on
behalf of this family.

01:16:35.729 --> 01:16:36.697
Who's insane?

01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:37.698
Hey! Hey!

01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:38.699
Who's unfit?

01:16:38.732 --> 01:16:41.969
Lily!

01:16:42.002 --> 01:16:44.405
My father is
unhinged, you see that, right?

01:16:44.438 --> 01:16:47.975
Whitman, you're
starting to scare me.

01:16:48.008 --> 01:16:52.079
So this truly is
the end of The Times.

01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:58.385
Are you sure
that's what you want?

01:16:58.419 --> 01:17:01.188
No other way, darling.

01:17:01.222 --> 01:17:05.626
I suppose I should be
hurt that I wasn't consulted.

01:17:07.428 --> 01:17:11.765
Did you really
not see it coming?

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.070
No, I didn't.

01:17:19.974 --> 01:17:21.208
Don't think I'm proud,

01:17:21.242 --> 01:17:23.944
cause you finally
decided to finish something.

01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:28.149
That's all, O'Connor?

01:17:28.182 --> 01:17:32.653
No sweet talk, no serenade?

01:17:33.454 --> 01:17:36.657
You wasted
enough time on me, June.

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:41.862
I do love you,
in case I never mentioned it.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:51.038
Goodnight, June!

01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:57.444
I messed up, Lou. Okay.

01:17:57.478 --> 01:18:01.682
I- wh-I d-I don-I
don't know what to say! I... I...

01:18:05.486 --> 01:18:09.123
I...

01:18:15.496 --> 01:18:17.998
I fucked Cotton.

01:18:30.512 --> 01:18:35.382
Pigs be fed,
yet hogs be slaughtered.

01:18:36.518 --> 01:18:38.352
Whitman?

01:18:38.385 --> 01:18:39.320
Pigs be what?

01:18:39.353 --> 01:18:44.358
I said, pigs be fed,
yet hogs be slaughtered.

01:18:47.127 --> 01:18:48.128
Whitman...

01:18:48.162 --> 01:18:48.929
Oh my God.

01:18:48.963 --> 01:18:50.364
This is between you and I.

01:18:50.397 --> 01:18:51.865
You and me, little brother.

01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:54.868
Boys!

01:18:54.902 --> 01:18:57.271
Put down the weapon, son.

01:18:57.304 --> 01:18:59.873
This is madness!

01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:02.876
Madness is a man's own brother

01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:05.513
sleeping with his wife
in a time of weakness.

01:19:05.547 --> 01:19:07.214
What are you talking about?

01:19:07.248 --> 01:19:08.315
Oh shit.

01:19:08.349 --> 01:19:10.017
Cotton O'Connor, my brother.

01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:13.521
You're son. Slept with my wife.

01:19:13.555 --> 01:19:15.923
The mother of my child.

01:19:15.956 --> 01:19:18.092
I was so lonely, Whitman.

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:22.229
You're being ridiculous.
Just put the gun down.

01:19:22.263 --> 01:19:25.032
Y tu, hermana. Supposed
to be us, versus them. Remember?

01:19:25.065 --> 01:19:28.068
Well, you're a bit off-script.

01:19:28.102 --> 01:19:31.138
I blame myself
for all this madness.

01:19:31.171 --> 01:19:34.074
I blame you too.

01:19:34.108 --> 01:19:36.910
You both seem surprised.

01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:40.548
Now that Viola and Whitman
the Third have both passed,

01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:43.417
I can no
longer hold my tongue, stand by,

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:47.087
and watch
you disembowel each other.

01:19:47.121 --> 01:19:51.458
Now I feel the need to remind
you all that you're family.

01:19:52.594 --> 01:19:55.129
Though if savage you've become

01:19:56.598 --> 01:20:00.801
then civilized
words are already lost.

01:20:08.242 --> 01:20:09.410
Whitman, I-

01:20:09.443 --> 01:20:13.013
Cotton, I know, I know, I
know, I just-I just wish that-

01:20:19.153 --> 01:20:22.122
Somebody call
the ambulance! Somebody!

01:20:22.156 --> 01:20:24.124
Be still, be still.

01:20:24.158 --> 01:20:28.162
It's gonna be alright,
kid. Your gonna be alright.

01:20:30.364 --> 01:20:34.502
Hold on, Cotton.

01:20:34.769 --> 01:20:38.606
I love you, too.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:43.545
Don't say that. Why would
she say that? Why now in the end?

01:20:43.578 --> 01:20:45.613
I have no more words to share.

01:20:45.647 --> 01:20:48.148
No poetic
sympathies for you to consider.

01:20:48.182 --> 01:20:50.217
It would always end like this.

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.253
Bittersweet and too
obvious to make it exciting.

01:20:53.287 --> 01:20:55.623
They finally
caught up to this old fox.

01:20:55.657 --> 01:20:57.391
They've ripped him to
shreds and left him wondering

01:20:57.424 --> 01:21:01.261
what could have been if he
had just seen tomorrow's sun.
