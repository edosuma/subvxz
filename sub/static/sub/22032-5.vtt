WEBVTT

00:07.922 --> 00:10.790
Mr. Adams also expresses his thanks

00:10.825 --> 00:14.060
once again for accepting his nomination

00:14.095 --> 00:17.430
and he addresses you as general.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.767
Sir.

00:21.803 --> 00:23.135
You have a visitor.

00:23.187 --> 00:25.304
Does the cold so numb your fingers, Joseph,

00:25.356 --> 00:28.024
that you cannot finish dressing for company?

00:28.059 --> 00:31.193
- Oh.
- I haven't time for visitors.

00:38.986 --> 00:40.903
Send him in.

00:55.002 --> 00:59.338
I imagine it's a time since
you've seen that dagger.

01:02.343 --> 01:04.477
Major Rogers.

01:04.512 --> 01:06.645
(laughs)

01:06.681 --> 01:09.565
I was wondering if you'd know my face.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.568
<i>To what do I owe this gift?</i>

01:12.603 --> 01:14.770
(knocks)

01:18.025 --> 01:21.744
Oh. Rest assured, boy,

01:21.779 --> 01:25.448
I mean your master no ill will.

01:26.584 --> 01:28.701
In fact, I come to congratulate him

01:28.753 --> 01:32.621
upon his recent most deserved appointment

01:32.673 --> 01:35.791
as general of the Continental Army.

01:35.843 --> 01:39.011
Major, what is it you want?

01:44.385 --> 01:48.354
I come to offer my service

01:48.389 --> 01:50.222
to America.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.362
I cannot endorse your methods.

01:57.281 --> 01:59.732
No, no, no, no, George.

02:02.069 --> 02:06.539
The same beast in me dwells in you, George.

02:06.574 --> 02:08.407
<i>All your battles lost,</i>

02:08.459 --> 02:11.043
<i>all the men you ever led to slaughter,</i>

02:11.078 --> 02:13.913
<i>all because you deny that feral nature.</i>

02:13.915 --> 02:16.582
<i>Unleash it or it will devour you</i>

02:16.584 --> 02:19.552
and your boys will pay the price.

02:24.509 --> 02:26.675
You're a student of history.

02:26.727 --> 02:30.262
I myself enjoy more recent color.

02:30.264 --> 02:33.933
Consider a man five years gone,

02:33.935 --> 02:36.185
appears in Philadelphia and swears

02:36.237 --> 02:39.021
not to take up arms against us.

02:39.073 --> 02:44.443
And then turns around and sells his services

02:44.445 --> 02:46.195
to the enemy.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.867
What man was that, hmm?

02:51.919 --> 02:54.119
A man who was followed.

03:03.381 --> 03:06.715
<i>Take him to New Hampshire to be disposed of</i>

03:06.767 --> 03:09.468
as their government judges best.

03:09.470 --> 03:12.888
You'll watch them all die again, George!

03:12.940 --> 03:15.391
I'll let you live to regret it!

03:15.443 --> 03:18.527
You will live to regret it!

It's not just yourself
you're putting at risk.

04:19.021 --> 04:20.687
You're endangering your whole family.

04:20.721 --> 04:23.056
I just thought I might ask why.

04:26.895 --> 04:30.313
It is my fault that I treated

I believe a judge needs

04:48.216 --> 04:49.833
Well, good luck with that.

04:49.885 --> 04:53.420
There will be no more warnings.

the folly of this venture.

05:00.595 --> 05:02.262
But tell another lie,

05:02.314 --> 05:04.764

06:18.673 --> 06:22.342
Good morning. I'm Major Tallmadge.

06:22.344 --> 06:23.760
And you are?

06:23.812 --> 06:27.347
Arthur Sutherland. Your servant.

06:27.349 --> 06:31.234
Well, it seems to me you might
be a bit lost, Mr. Sutherland.

06:31.269 --> 06:34.737
This is where I'd come to join
the Continental Army, is it not?

06:34.773 --> 06:37.774
Let me remind you that we
have special punishments

06:37.826 --> 06:40.910
for those who try to worm
their way behind our lines.

06:40.946 --> 06:43.830
Which is why I did not cross over earlier.

06:43.865 --> 06:46.616
Had to wait until fate
provided an opportunity

06:46.668 --> 06:47.867
for me to prove my loyalty.

06:47.869 --> 06:50.370
Fate? Please, I'm listening.

06:50.422 --> 06:52.539
Soon another man will come into the camp.

06:52.541 --> 06:54.874
A civilian. He will make some wild claim.

06:54.926 --> 06:58.178
He will sound very convincing,
but make no mistake,

06:58.213 --> 07:00.380
this man is not to be trusted.

07:00.382 --> 07:03.016
Hmm. And what is this man's name?

07:03.051 --> 07:04.968
Bill Shanks.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.854
And what are Mr. Shanks' true intentions?

07:07.889 --> 07:11.057
To burrow deep and spy for the king.

07:11.059 --> 07:12.809
Oh, dear.

07:12.861 --> 07:16.029
Now tell me, how is it that
you've come to know all this?

07:16.064 --> 07:18.898
Because I was the one assigned
to escort him through our lines

07:18.900 --> 07:21.367
by Major John André.

07:21.403 --> 07:24.404
Thought he could trust one of us to
escort Shanks to the border, then return.

07:24.406 --> 07:26.573
But I doubled back and beat him here.

07:31.379 --> 07:33.163
What wild claim?

07:33.215 --> 07:34.914
Sorry?

07:34.966 --> 07:38.968
What wild claim will Bill Shanks
make to gain our trust?

07:39.004 --> 07:43.056
That I am afraid I do not know.

07:43.091 --> 07:45.592
Now, I know he wouldn't be the first redcoat

07:45.644 --> 07:47.093
to wander behind our lines,

07:47.095 --> 07:50.763
but one with direct knowledge
of André's operations.

07:50.765 --> 07:53.099
I mean, he could be valuable to us.

07:53.101 --> 07:56.102
- <i>(Clanging)</i>
- Mr. Sackett?

07:57.405 --> 07:59.272
Mr. Sackett.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.660
(Grunts, groans)

08:05.363 --> 08:08.948
Not for prying eyes.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.783
I'm head of intelligence.

08:10.835 --> 08:12.168
One cannot be too careful.

08:12.204 --> 08:15.288
Right, so, the defector...

08:15.340 --> 08:18.541
Ah. I am reminded of an old story

08:18.593 --> 08:22.428
in which a foolish youth

08:22.464 --> 08:27.100
spied a tree bearing low-hanging fruit.

08:27.135 --> 08:29.719
So... so, what, you think he's a bad apple?

08:29.771 --> 08:33.722
I think it would be best
to heed God's warning

08:33.775 --> 08:35.475
not to sample a bite.

08:35.477 --> 08:37.443
And would you be God in this scenario?

08:46.288 --> 08:49.656

- Oh! Nice to see you, too.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.407
Sir.

08:51.459 --> 08:53.826
Your pirate returns with
Blackbeard's treasure.

08:53.828 --> 08:55.962
Straight from the head of the king himself.

08:55.997 --> 08:58.047
- Where's my drill?
- Forget the drill.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.833
Where have you been? It was
meant to be a simple retrieval.

09:00.835 --> 09:02.585
Nothing simple about it, Tall-boy.

09:02.637 --> 09:05.805
You see, first of all, I went
back to Morristown, didn't I?

09:05.840 --> 09:08.007
Only to hear, "Sorry, sir,

09:08.009 --> 09:10.927
you know, the army's picked up and
moved from this godforsaken pit

09:10.979 --> 09:12.679
to another godforsaken pit."

09:14.649 --> 09:17.350
Jesus. What's going on here?

09:17.402 --> 09:21.154
(Muttering)

09:33.835 --> 09:36.085
Can this possibly be genuine?

09:36.121 --> 09:39.789
From one George to another.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.295
William,

09:45.347 --> 09:47.046
please invite the gentleman

09:47.098 --> 09:50.350
from Rodrigue Hortalez here immediately.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.391
(Whispers) Who the hell is
"Rodricky Whore-to-lez"?

09:58.443 --> 10:00.443
It's not a man, it's a front

10:00.478 --> 10:02.362
for French secret intelligence.

10:02.397 --> 10:03.863
Right.

10:03.898 --> 10:07.066

10:47.664 --> 10:49.414
Simcoe: <i> Whoa.</i>

10:49.466 --> 10:53.335
Akinbode, we're home.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.422
- Tie up there in the paddock.
- Man: <i> Aye, sir.</i>

10:57.474 --> 10:59.057
<i>Tie the horses up in the paddock.</i>

10:59.093 --> 11:00.559
Jordan?

11:08.068 --> 11:10.902
Hello.

11:12.189 --> 11:14.156
Ooh.

11:18.195 --> 11:20.162
Hewlett: <i>You!</i>

11:22.449 --> 11:25.417
How dare you show your
face in this place again?

11:25.452 --> 11:27.252
Please, Major, there's no need for apology.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.621
- It's good to see you.
- An apology?

11:29.673 --> 11:31.423
Yes, I've already chosen to forgive

11:31.458 --> 11:34.209
past transgressions and begin anew.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.129
This is not a military uniform.

11:37.181 --> 11:39.097
Not a regular's, no.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.184
It's fallen to me to take command
of His Majesty's irregulars.

11:42.219 --> 11:44.803
The Queen's Rangers.

11:44.855 --> 11:47.522
I think I finally understand

11:47.558 --> 11:50.142
the burden of a full command.

11:50.194 --> 11:53.945
Killing men in cold blood is
hardly a leadership quality.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.783
In the meantime, while my men camp there,

11:57.818 --> 11:59.818
I require more domestic accommodations.

11:59.870 --> 12:02.988
Your tavern, Mrs. Strong, should do nicely.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.240
Of course, Captain.

12:07.211 --> 12:09.795
You're more than welcome to rest in my room.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.999
It's perfect timing, actually.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.552
Major Hewlett had just this morning

12:17.588 --> 12:19.421
offered me lodging at Whitehall

12:19.473 --> 12:23.008
<i>and I've accepted with gratitude.</i>

12:23.010 --> 12:26.094
It was the least that I could do.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.263
I fear it may not be enough.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.515
My men have heard rumors of rebels

12:30.567 --> 12:33.852
<i>raiding private homes
all across Long Island.</i>

12:33.904 --> 12:37.022
I worry that Whitehall may
not be as safe as it once was.

12:37.074 --> 12:38.857
Thank you for your concern,

12:38.909 --> 12:42.360
but I can assure you,
this town is quite safe

12:42.362 --> 12:47.199
since dangerous elements were
chased out of it last spring.

12:47.201 --> 12:50.452
Have my men collected your
baggage yet as per your request?

12:50.504 --> 12:52.704
I... I believe they were just about to.

13:00.464 --> 13:02.464
Come.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.114
Best out of three, wasn't it?

13:19.149 --> 13:21.149
I don't have any time for games tonight.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.702
So why don't you follow
that gentleman's example

13:23.737 --> 13:25.320
and pay your outstanding bill?

13:25.372 --> 13:28.156
Oh, I forgot last time, yeah.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.574
I was in a bit of a hurry.

13:29.626 --> 13:30.909
It's quite all right, Mr. Woodhull.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.745
You may amend the error and be on your way.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.413
Woodhull?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.666
<i>Ah, so you're Woodhull?</i>

13:37.718 --> 13:39.751
(chuckles)

13:41.588 --> 13:43.722
Dinner's ready, son.

13:43.757 --> 13:44.973
Son?

13:45.008 --> 13:47.425
- Samuel Townsend.
- Oh.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.511
I have heard much about you, sir.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.730
- Is that right?
- Robert: <i> Father, he's only just arrived.</i>

13:51.765 --> 13:54.182
- <i>He must be tired.</i>
- He must be hungry.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.684
Join us, young man.

13:56.570 --> 13:57.686
I could eat.

13:57.738 --> 13:59.938
(laughing)

14:03.911 --> 14:06.528
Mm! Excellent, sir.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.864
You must possess considerable skill
to cook without salt or butter.

14:09.917 --> 14:14.336
We Quakers try to avoid those
condiments tainted by sin,

14:14.371 --> 14:16.371
having contributed to the taxes

14:16.423 --> 14:17.872
that brought on this war.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.624
Are you nearly finished, then?

14:19.626 --> 14:22.510
- Uh, no.
- Let the boy eat, Robert.

14:22.546 --> 14:24.095
Did you see me pull his plate?

14:24.131 --> 14:26.848
Man: <i> Oi, innkeeper, there's
a cockroach in my gravy.</i>

14:26.883 --> 14:28.466
<i>And we need more ale.</i>

14:28.518 --> 14:30.018
Duty calls.

14:30.053 --> 14:32.437
- Yes, it does.
- Yes, it does.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.060
I will be back momentarily.

14:47.788 --> 14:50.655
That's a very fine cane you have there.

14:50.707 --> 14:52.958
And nice silver buckles.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.629
Quite radical for a Quaker,
wouldn't you agree?

14:57.664 --> 14:58.997
My son would.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.499
He'd argue that it's better
to keep to our faith,

15:01.551 --> 15:04.135
<i>but our faith has so many rules...</i>

15:04.171 --> 15:08.089
modesty, silence, neutrality.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.591
Not all can be followed.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.092
Well, how do you determine

15:11.144 --> 15:13.762
which to forgo and which to respect?

15:16.316 --> 15:19.184
Robert will make the right
choice and serve God,

15:19.236 --> 15:20.986
not a king who pretends to be Him.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.688
But it will take time.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.690
There are pressures back home

15:25.742 --> 15:27.942
which limit my visits to the city.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.361
How much time have you got?

15:29.413 --> 15:32.080
I leave tomorrow. I need his answer tonight.

15:39.089 --> 15:40.672
(Clears throat)

15:41.591 --> 15:43.508
Man: <i>The royal seal.</i>

15:43.543 --> 15:45.877
You are convinced of its authenticity?

15:46.963 --> 15:48.880
Monsieur de Francy, this was torn

15:48.932 --> 15:51.216
from the royal exchequer's balance ledger.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.184
In it is all the expenditures

15:53.220 --> 15:54.886
His Majesty is forced to make

15:54.938 --> 15:57.689
in order to sustain wars in India,

15:57.724 --> 15:59.607
the Caribbean, the high seas,

15:59.643 --> 16:01.443
<i>and here in the colonies.</i>

16:01.478 --> 16:06.448
In short, sir, England is all but bankrupt.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.120
How did it come into your possession?

16:12.155 --> 16:14.205
Sackett: <i>Through considerable effort,</i>

16:14.241 --> 16:18.626
we were able to place a spy
inside His Majesty's court.

16:18.662 --> 16:21.629
She was in the room

16:21.665 --> 16:26.501
when the king received
this financial crisis.

16:26.553 --> 16:30.171
How dare they tell me we owe?

16:30.223 --> 16:32.257
I am the one who collects.

16:32.309 --> 16:33.975
I collect!

16:34.010 --> 16:36.094
He did not take it well.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.930
- This tells me...
- Your Majesty, please.

16:38.982 --> 16:41.266
We cannot afford any more war.

16:41.318 --> 16:44.769
And seizing opportunity,
our agent took it upon herself

16:44.771 --> 16:48.773
to steal the most crucial piece of evidence.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.325
King George: <i>Why are you
always following me around?</i>

16:50.360 --> 16:51.943
<i>Like a little dog, are we?</i>

16:51.995 --> 16:54.913
How is it she was not immediately
discovered by the king's men?

16:54.948 --> 16:56.498
They were indisposed.

16:56.533 --> 16:59.451
Dog time? Dog time? Woof,
woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof!

16:59.503 --> 17:03.204
Apparently, the poor monarch is quite mad.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.789
Do you have proof of that?

17:04.840 --> 17:08.009
Monsieur, you have asked for
proof that we can win this fight.

17:08.044 --> 17:10.178
We have shown it on the field at Saratoga.

17:10.213 --> 17:13.348
Now we show it in cold, hard numbers.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.551
It is time to unite.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.523
I will depart from camp at once

17:22.559 --> 17:25.944
and not rest until I see this into
the hand of King Louis himself.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.645
Aw...

17:27.696 --> 17:30.815
afraid I can't let you
do that, "de Frenchy."

17:33.320 --> 17:36.154
It's Brewster, sir. Lieutenant.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.407
- I know who you are.
- Just not why you speak.

17:39.459 --> 17:44.162
Sir, King George, he knows his
ledger's been stolen, right?

17:44.214 --> 17:46.047
He's dispatched Robert
Rogers to retrieve it.

17:46.082 --> 17:47.582
- Ben: <i> Rogers?</i>
- Caleb: Yeah.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.084
And he has orders, sir, not
to let that reach France.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.836
<i>He's been on my trail since Jersey</i>

17:51.888 --> 17:54.088
and he's out there now just
waiting for us to make our move.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.890
Ben: <i>Well, we make a duplicate.</i>

17:55.926 --> 17:57.759
We'll send a hundred copies all at once.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.728
No, no, no. I cannot go back
to France with a forgery.

18:00.764 --> 18:03.097
This seal must reach Versailles.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.402
Is this Rogers truly so dangerous?

18:07.437 --> 18:09.404
Yes. Yes, he is.

18:09.439 --> 18:10.605
How many men does he have with him?

18:10.657 --> 18:13.691
Uh, I mean, 10, but it could be more.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.578
Surely this man cannot
overrun a full cavalry.

18:16.613 --> 18:19.664
Rogers is a hunter.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.749
We must throw him off our scent.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.752
We'll send the cavalry out in force,

18:24.788 --> 18:27.589
then split the detachment in two.

18:27.624 --> 18:29.674
One will head to Portsmouth,

18:29.709 --> 18:31.209
the other to Baltimore.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.544
He won't know which has the treasure.

18:32.596 --> 18:34.629
No, he'll just split his men
in two and track them both.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.382
Yes, and while he's doing
that, he will be unaware

18:37.384 --> 18:41.970
that a third party had
already left camp tonight.

18:42.022 --> 18:44.439
A single plainclothes fur trader

18:44.474 --> 18:48.309
accompanied by one of our
more trusted native scouts.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.229
He'll travel off trail to Port Charlestown

18:51.281 --> 18:53.948
and from there to France

18:53.984 --> 18:58.203
to secure the future of this great nation.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.123
Long live the United States of America.

19:02.158 --> 19:03.958
<i>Et vive la France.</i>

19:08.999 --> 19:11.132
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.335
I want every man on his horse
and ready to ride in 20 minutes.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.471
- Aye. 20 minutes.
- Thank you.

19:16.506 --> 19:17.972
- Dragoons.
- Sir.

19:18.008 --> 19:20.091
- Boots and saddles.
- Aye, sir.

19:20.143 --> 19:22.644
<i>(Men shouting)</i>

19:26.349 --> 19:29.484
Right, so, which do you want?
Portsmouth or Baltimore?

19:29.519 --> 19:31.185
Man: <i>Major Tallmadge, sir.</i>

19:31.238 --> 19:32.770
<i>A civilian has come into camp.</i>

19:32.772 --> 19:35.189
Claims to have urgent news
for General Washington.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.609
A civilian?

19:37.611 --> 19:39.611
(Coughing)

19:45.368 --> 19:47.619
Who the hell are you?

19:47.621 --> 19:50.121
Look, I made my way through
rain, snow, and two battle lines

19:50.123 --> 19:52.423
to speak with your general, not some boy.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.042
- Now, where is he?
- <i>Yes, of course, sir.</i>

19:54.094 --> 19:56.010
And what name shall I give to the general?

19:56.046 --> 19:59.097
Shanks. Bill Shanks.

19:59.132 --> 20:00.515
Now go get him.

20:00.550 --> 20:02.634
It's of the utmost importance.

20:02.686 --> 20:06.721
What, did you honestly think that
you could just walk into this camp

20:06.773 --> 20:10.892
and demand an audience with the
commander-in-chief of the Continental Army?

20:13.613 --> 20:15.980
Well, I won't talk with anyone else.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.733
(Sniffs) You realize that
you've crossed over

20:18.785 --> 20:21.819
military lines wearing civilian clothing?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.871
That means that you can be hanged as a spy

20:23.907 --> 20:26.658
if I determine that your
intentions are insincere.

20:26.710 --> 20:29.377
So, please, for your own sake,

20:29.412 --> 20:31.879
what is it you have to say?

20:36.252 --> 20:38.386
No? All right, fine.

20:38.421 --> 20:40.672
Then you can just sit here
until we ring in the new year.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.640
Not without your commander, you won't.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.596
What did you just say?

20:48.648 --> 20:52.567
There is to be an assassination attempt

20:52.602 --> 20:55.570
on Washington sometime before the new year.

20:57.107 --> 21:00.358
<i>And it is to be carried out
by someone inside this camp.</i>

21:02.495 --> 21:04.278
<i>Mr. Sutherland.</i>

21:05.699 --> 21:07.865
Shanks has come in.

21:07.867 --> 21:12.503
Now remember, whatever
he tells you, it's a lie.

21:29.136 --> 21:30.602
Thought you'd be asleep.

21:30.638 --> 21:32.688
No, no. I'm quite awake.

21:32.723 --> 21:36.692
<i>We think it you who've been
a-slumber for too long.</i>

21:38.729 --> 21:40.729
Get out.

21:40.731 --> 21:42.114
No more games, Robert.

21:42.149 --> 21:44.950
- This is my room, my inn.
- <i>This is the king's room.</i>

21:44.985 --> 21:48.787
Under his martial law, your business and
your life are at the mercy of the Crown.

21:48.823 --> 21:50.656
An excellent argument

21:50.708 --> 21:53.075
to keep quiet and follow the law.

21:53.127 --> 21:54.827
And to all outside appearances,

21:54.879 --> 21:57.129
that is exactly what you'd be doing.

21:57.164 --> 21:59.965
Now, your safety is important to us, Robert.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.084
Us? Who is us?

22:05.656 --> 22:07.539
No more games, eh?

22:11.379 --> 22:15.464
General Washington, Commander-in-Chief
of the Continental Army.

22:15.499 --> 22:18.584
That is who I serve directly.

22:20.188 --> 22:22.721
<i>And so would you.</i>

22:22.773 --> 22:26.692
Robert, you are exactly what
Washington needs most...

22:26.727 --> 22:29.862
a friend that's already inside the city.

22:29.897 --> 22:31.981
You wouldn't even have to risk travel.

22:32.033 --> 22:34.066
All right? You'd live your life.

22:34.118 --> 22:35.901
You write down what you see,

22:35.953 --> 22:37.870
what you hear, and then you
send it to me on Long Island.

22:37.905 --> 22:39.205
- (laughs)
- All right?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.574
Anything that is incriminating
will be concealed.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.826
- In an egg, I assume?
- No, no, we have invisible ink.

22:43.878 --> 22:45.494
- I will give you a demonstra...
- Invisible ink?

22:45.546 --> 22:48.080
Which I can demonstrate to
you and you will be convinced.

22:48.132 --> 22:50.166
And you will be protected.

22:50.218 --> 22:53.335
No one will know your true name,
not even inside the Continental camp.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.392
I don't know what I could write

23:00.428 --> 23:04.096
that would be of any interest to
you or to General Washington.

23:04.148 --> 23:06.148
Troop numbers. Ship numbers.

23:06.184 --> 23:08.734
Anything that you hear from an
officer ranked captain or higher.

23:08.769 --> 23:10.569
You invite this danger into our family?

23:10.605 --> 23:13.656
No, Robert, you did when you
chose to tell me his secret.

23:13.691 --> 23:15.908
As a warning.

23:15.943 --> 23:18.777
As an example to keep
your mouth as a bridle.

23:18.829 --> 23:21.697
The wrong word, written or said,

23:21.699 --> 23:23.115
can get a man hanged.

23:23.167 --> 23:24.667
Is that what you wish for me?

23:24.702 --> 23:27.419
I wish for you to choose a side and act.

23:27.455 --> 23:30.706
With faith and conviction. I pray for you.

23:30.708 --> 23:33.209
- Pray for him.
- Robert, please.

23:33.211 --> 23:34.927
My answer is no.

23:36.180 --> 23:38.180
And unless you wish me to communicate that

23:38.216 --> 23:39.965
to the grenadier in room three,

23:40.017 --> 23:42.885
I suggest that you leave now
and be gone by morning.

23:49.644 --> 23:51.644
All right, all right, all
right, all right, Robert.

24:06.410 --> 24:09.078
Ben, we've got to warn Washington now.

24:09.080 --> 24:13.832
Look, Shanks has said everything
that Sutherland claimed he would.

24:13.884 --> 24:16.168
Which means he's just
lying to gain our favor.

24:16.220 --> 24:18.554
<i>Besides, I'm on thin ice
with Washington as it is.</i>

24:18.589 --> 24:20.723
I can't just go to him now and cry wolf,

24:20.758 --> 24:23.225
not when he's in the middle of
securing an alliance with France.

24:23.261 --> 24:25.394
An alliance won't mean shite

24:25.429 --> 24:27.513
if we ain't got a chief to lead the army.

24:30.318 --> 24:33.569
Besides, what if it's the
bloody-back who's lying?

24:33.604 --> 24:34.987
What if they're both lying?

24:35.022 --> 24:38.490
Caleb: <i>Jesus, Sackett. Do
you even trust yourself?</i>

24:38.526 --> 24:41.026
- Not for years.
- Unbelievable.

24:42.330 --> 24:44.997
Caleb: <i>Tall-boy, get to the bottom of this.</i>

24:45.032 --> 24:46.532
I'll lead the decoy to Baltimore.

24:46.584 --> 24:48.751
- No, Caleb.
- Listen to me.

24:48.786 --> 24:50.669
We'll be fine.

24:52.957 --> 24:54.757
Wait.

24:59.046 --> 25:01.046
See you later.

25:06.387 --> 25:07.469
Shanks: What are you doing?

25:07.521 --> 25:09.054
- Sackett: Put your hand...
- Ben: Sit still.

25:09.106 --> 25:10.556
Ah.

25:10.608 --> 25:11.890
Ow!

25:11.942 --> 25:15.110
Mr. Sackett here is a clever sort.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.313
His contraption can detect

25:17.315 --> 25:20.316
a heart's pulse rate in the extremities.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.986
It's going to reveal to me whether
you're telling fact or fiction.

25:24.038 --> 25:25.621
But be careful, you wait too long,

25:25.656 --> 25:27.539
it might snap your fingers clean off.

25:27.575 --> 25:29.491
No, no, no, no. I'm telling the truth.

25:29.493 --> 25:31.126
Well, we'll see about that.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.662
You claim that you walked
through two armies' lines,

25:33.664 --> 25:36.832
waded through rain and
snow, and no one saw you?

25:36.884 --> 25:38.500
I was careful. I made sure.

25:38.502 --> 25:41.470
No? Not even Lieutenant Sutherland?

25:41.505 --> 25:43.422
Who? I... I don't know any Sutherland.

25:43.474 --> 25:45.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't
know any Sutherland.

25:45.593 --> 25:48.594
He knows you. Told us all about
you and your secret mission.

25:48.646 --> 25:50.929
No, no, no, no. I don't have any secrets.

25:50.981 --> 25:53.148
I don't. I don't. I told you my secret.

25:53.184 --> 25:54.683
Yes, and why? Why tell us?

25:54.685 --> 25:55.851
Why go to all this trouble?

25:55.853 --> 25:57.569
Better hurry. Up next is toes.

25:57.605 --> 26:00.689
No, no, no, listen. Listen, please.

26:00.741 --> 26:02.491
I work as a clerk

26:02.526 --> 26:05.244
in Philadelphia.

26:05.279 --> 26:07.496
My office is on Lombard Street.

26:07.531 --> 26:09.581
One week ago, I heard two men talking.

26:09.617 --> 26:11.116
Royal officers.

26:11.168 --> 26:13.786
They were discussing how they
would put a man in the camp

26:13.838 --> 26:15.204
to kill Washington.

26:15.256 --> 26:17.539
How that would end this war.

26:17.541 --> 26:19.291
How they would be rewarded.

26:19.343 --> 26:21.377
Ah, yes, and you thought that
if you warned Washington,

26:21.379 --> 26:25.047
you'd be rewarded just
the same, maybe even more.

26:25.099 --> 26:27.266
I thought God was giving me a sign.

26:27.301 --> 26:30.302
Right, and these men, these
officers, what are their names?

26:30.354 --> 26:32.187
One of them was called... called Gamble.

26:32.223 --> 26:35.808
- All right, the other man.
- Uh, I didn't... I didn't catch his name,

26:35.860 --> 26:39.728
but he was handsome, tall...

26:39.730 --> 26:42.448
With a slender, blond braid
worn down the shoulder.

26:42.483 --> 26:43.982
Does that sound familiar to you?

26:44.034 --> 26:46.985
Sounds exactly like Major André.

26:47.037 --> 26:49.571
Well, you were right about Shanks.

26:49.573 --> 26:52.958
He made an outrageous claim
to gain our confidence.

26:52.993 --> 26:55.994
Truly? What was it?

26:58.048 --> 27:02.050
Well, he said that General Howe

27:02.086 --> 27:04.887
would attack this camp before the new year.

27:07.591 --> 27:09.174
It's a good story.

27:09.226 --> 27:11.093
André could even arrange a small skirmish

27:11.145 --> 27:14.763
to sell the lie, embed Shanks deeper.

27:14.815 --> 27:17.349
Well, we may add some fortifications,

27:17.401 --> 27:19.184
but I think just to be safe,

27:19.236 --> 27:21.019
we'll send Washington away from here.

27:21.071 --> 27:24.356
At least until the new year.

27:24.408 --> 27:26.525
Is that wise?

27:26.577 --> 27:29.912
To separate the commander-in-chief
from his own army?

27:29.947 --> 27:32.331
You would counsel otherwise?

27:32.366 --> 27:34.249
I'd not surrender him to men in the dark.

27:34.285 --> 27:37.920
I'd keep him surrounded
by those he trusts most.

27:39.623 --> 27:42.791
Sutherland is lying. Shanks' threat is real.

27:42.793 --> 27:45.093
- Are you sure?
- Well, he's telling the truth

27:45.129 --> 27:48.297
about as well as that thing
can detect a heartbeat.

27:56.053 --> 28:00.709
Shanks described André and he's
willing to give us more names.

28:00.709 --> 28:02.492
Sir, I'm more sure of a man driven by greed

28:02.544 --> 28:04.077
- than I am of one...
- Shanks.

28:04.079 --> 28:06.663
So clearly spouting recited motivations.

28:07.916 --> 28:10.083
And what is the motivation of this fusilier?

28:10.135 --> 28:11.585
Billy?

28:11.587 --> 28:14.805
Well, sir, if André suspected
that Shanks overheard his plot,

28:14.840 --> 28:17.341
he'd send Sutherland ahead
to discredit the man.

28:17.393 --> 28:20.427
To make his warning sound
suspect, desperate even.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.020
So that is your conclusion?

28:30.072 --> 28:33.774
To condemn Sutherland and reward Shanks?

28:33.826 --> 28:35.275
With more time, I could...

28:35.327 --> 28:37.694
Let's see if more time is necessary.

28:39.114 --> 28:40.080
Sir...

28:40.115 --> 28:42.783
<i>(man shouting orders)</i>

29:03.472 --> 29:05.889
You wished to speak with me?

29:05.941 --> 29:09.026
(Clears throat)

29:09.061 --> 29:12.195
Your Excellency, your
person is in mortal danger.

29:12.231 --> 29:14.981
And I came as quick as I could to warn you.

29:14.983 --> 29:16.316
What is your full name?

29:16.368 --> 29:18.318
Wilcox Shanks, sir.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.204
Your full name, please.

29:24.827 --> 29:27.160
Bartholomew Wilcox Shanks.

29:27.212 --> 29:30.464
In truth, Mr. Shanks, you
were at a disadvantage

29:30.499 --> 29:31.965
the moment you arrived.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.667
Sir?

29:33.719 --> 29:36.336
This is not the first time a man
has appeared out of the night

29:36.388 --> 29:38.422
to offer his services to me.

29:38.474 --> 29:41.425
And I learned then that
knowing one's reasons

29:41.477 --> 29:44.845
is as necessary as knowing the lies

29:44.847 --> 29:46.263
he's willing to sell.

29:46.315 --> 29:50.100
<i>Three months ago, we suffered a loss</i>

29:50.152 --> 29:54.071
severe enough to be given an epithet...

29:55.641 --> 29:58.224
the Paoli Massacre.

29:58.226 --> 30:01.528
Born at the hands of a British adjutant,

30:01.563 --> 30:03.063
a Major John André.

30:03.065 --> 30:06.650
So heavy were the losses that I reviewed

30:06.702 --> 30:10.904
the order of battle for
the names of the dead

30:10.906 --> 30:15.158
and the captured and missing.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.246
<i>One name stuck out.</i>

30:20.299 --> 30:22.248
<i>A Pennsylvania 10th man</i>

30:22.250 --> 30:24.250
<i>who'd just been cited for court-martial</i>

30:24.303 --> 30:28.004
for stealing an officer's boots.

30:28.056 --> 30:32.342
Clearly he had deserted during battle

30:32.394 --> 30:35.679
and then defected to the enemy.

30:43.105 --> 30:44.571
Wait, sir.

30:44.606 --> 30:46.439
(Sobbing)

30:46.491 --> 30:48.074
Sir, he may have been one of ours,

30:48.110 --> 30:50.026
but his motive could be
absolution, not vengeance.

30:50.078 --> 30:52.278
- Major.
- Sir, please!

30:52.280 --> 30:55.281
Please, sir, hear me.

30:55.283 --> 30:59.085
Just because his biography was false
does not mean that his story is also.

30:59.121 --> 31:01.621
Tallmadge, your judgment in this matter

31:01.623 --> 31:04.290
is indicative of your judgment
these last several months.

31:04.343 --> 31:07.377
You are blinded when I need you able to see.

31:07.429 --> 31:10.880
I... I don't believe that I'm wrong, sir.

31:11.933 --> 31:14.017
Yes, and that is the problem.

31:16.438 --> 31:18.521
- Mr. Sackett.
- Sir.

31:18.557 --> 31:21.191
You will debrief Sutherland.

31:35.157 --> 31:37.323
<i>(Knock at door)</i>

31:47.919 --> 31:50.053
He told me to give you your bill.

31:50.088 --> 31:52.088
(Scoffs)

31:56.928 --> 31:59.179
Are all sons so stubborn?

32:04.903 --> 32:07.153
I won't give up on him.

32:07.189 --> 32:08.988
He wants this.

32:09.024 --> 32:10.573
He just needs to see that it's possible.

32:10.609 --> 32:13.193
That's why he gave me this bill.

32:13.245 --> 32:17.697
To give to you because he knew that
I would come here and say this.

32:17.699 --> 32:19.582
It's the game that we play.

32:19.618 --> 32:21.701
Please, don't give up on him either.

32:21.753 --> 32:24.120
On your next trip, that's when he'll bend.

32:24.172 --> 32:26.206
If there is a next trip.

32:26.208 --> 32:28.091
Why? What prevents you from returning?

32:28.126 --> 32:29.759
Let's just say...

32:31.713 --> 32:34.347
not all fathers are as
encouraging as you are.

32:34.382 --> 32:36.516
Well, I encourage you.

32:37.719 --> 32:39.519
Find your way back.

32:39.554 --> 32:41.938
For all our sakes.

33:09.468 --> 33:12.919
Major, after this last trip
to New York, I am convinced

33:12.971 --> 33:15.138
that we are on the cusp of
unmasking the Sons of Liberty.

33:15.173 --> 33:18.224
Do go on. Did you find Browning?

33:18.260 --> 33:20.810
I found him.

33:20.846 --> 33:22.979
According to the "Royal Gazette,"

33:23.014 --> 33:26.983
a man named Henry Browning was
found knifed to death in the Bowery.

33:29.104 --> 33:32.105
Well, sir, they, ahem...

33:33.525 --> 33:35.692
- they must have killed him.
- Killed one of their own?

33:35.744 --> 33:37.443
Likely because they know
that you were onto him.

33:37.496 --> 33:39.863
- Which means you're exposed.
- Oh, dear.

33:45.170 --> 33:47.453
You need evidence, don't you?

33:47.455 --> 33:49.756
- Richard's voice: <i>Or a confession.</i>
- Or a confession.

33:51.126 --> 33:52.342
Grumpy old bastard.

33:52.377 --> 33:54.127
Your father is right, Abraham.

33:54.179 --> 33:57.463
Three trips to New York, it's
growing awfully expensive.

33:57.465 --> 33:59.349
Especially since we have
no names other than those

33:59.384 --> 34:02.352
who have left town or who are deceased.

34:02.387 --> 34:03.853
No names.

34:03.889 --> 34:06.439
No proof of any hidden rebels.

34:06.474 --> 34:08.808
You want a name? I'll give
you a name. Robert Townsend.

34:08.810 --> 34:12.110
A smug Quaker shite

34:12.147 --> 34:14.063
who also cheats at draughts.

34:14.114 --> 34:15.782
No, you don't need names.
You don't need names.

34:15.817 --> 34:17.483
You need evidence.

34:22.958 --> 34:24.991
In writing.

34:26.328 --> 34:30.246
Sir, the rebel dead drop
is exposed to us now.

34:30.297 --> 34:32.498
You send men to investigate its contents.

34:32.551 --> 34:34.500
It will lead us directly
to the Sons of Liberty.

34:34.502 --> 34:37.503
You believe this drop is still in use?

34:43.645 --> 34:45.594
I'm sure of it.

35:17.178 --> 35:19.128
Guard: Nice, I'll go check.

35:29.941 --> 35:31.441
Hey, what are you doing there?

35:31.476 --> 35:33.276
What are you doing, trying
to knock down my wall?

35:33.311 --> 35:35.561
Hey, go on, get out. Get!

35:35.614 --> 35:38.481
You there. What are you doing?

35:50.545 --> 35:52.962
<i>What did you just put in your pocket?</i>

35:52.998 --> 35:54.580
Give it here.

35:56.751 --> 35:58.501
(Gunshot)

36:16.988 --> 36:20.606
Hey, Linch, we just caught us a spy.

36:33.918 --> 36:37.753
So, Major John André.

36:38.723 --> 36:40.056
I'd like to know all I can

36:40.091 --> 36:42.842
about my honored nemesis.

36:42.894 --> 36:46.012
Let's start with the braid.

36:49.434 --> 36:52.318
- <i>(Flute playing)</i>
- <i>(Men shouting)</i>

36:58.703 --> 37:00.666
If I'd taken those boots,
I would've lost my foot.

37:00.666 --> 37:04.012
Yes, and if you'd told me the truth,
then you wouldn't be hanging.

37:04.012 --> 37:07.418
Now listen to me. We are gonna
give you one more chance.

37:07.464 --> 37:10.000
Is there truly a threat
on Washington's life?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.311
- Yes!
- Then give me something!

37:11.347 --> 37:13.597
Who's the assassin? How are they
gonna get him into the camp?

37:13.649 --> 37:17.017
They just said sometime before the new year.

37:17.069 --> 37:19.269
André and his man Gamble.

37:20.740 --> 37:23.857
Wait. Wait, describe him to me.

37:23.859 --> 37:27.111
- André? I did.
- No, Gamble. Gamble. Describe Gamble.

37:27.163 --> 37:31.248
Uh, he had kind of a scar
on his cheek from fencing

37:31.283 --> 37:33.333
or from... from...

37:41.377 --> 37:42.843
Mr. Sackett!

37:42.878 --> 37:46.797
Oh, God, no, no! No, Mr. Sackett!

37:46.849 --> 37:49.016
Guard, help!

37:49.935 --> 37:51.935
Help! Someone help!

37:54.056 --> 37:56.056
Mr. Sackett, no. No, please.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.608
It's all right.

37:57.643 --> 37:59.143
It's all right. Don't... don't go.

37:59.195 --> 38:01.395
- Get the doctor! I'm here.
- (Gurgling)

38:01.447 --> 38:03.897
It's all right. It's all
right. Please don't go.

38:03.899 --> 38:06.900
Please stay with me. Get the doctor now!

38:06.902 --> 38:08.902
Oh, God. Please don't go.

38:08.904 --> 38:11.288
- Guard: <i> Doctor!</i>
- No, no.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.740
Please, Nathaniel. Don't go.

38:13.742 --> 38:17.127
I'm so sorry.

38:17.163 --> 38:19.797
(Sobbing) No!

38:21.417 --> 38:25.669
(Men shouting)

38:25.721 --> 38:27.337
Man: <i> Sir!</i>

38:27.389 --> 38:29.756
Man ♪2: <i>On the inside, go!</i>

38:31.060 --> 38:34.228
Ben: <i>You were never the target, sir.</i>

38:34.263 --> 38:35.762
<i>We were.</i>

38:35.764 --> 38:38.265
Gamble stole vital documents,

38:38.317 --> 38:41.068
some of them containing
the name Samuel Culper.

38:41.103 --> 38:43.103
(Mutters)

38:43.105 --> 38:45.656
André allowed Shanks to eavesdrop

38:45.691 --> 38:47.107
in order to blind us.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.326
Ben: <i>No, to blind you, sir.</i>

38:49.361 --> 38:51.995
If you had let me do my job...

39:03.959 --> 39:06.460
Certain I was right.

39:07.463 --> 39:09.680
I was certain.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.806
- <i>(Bird warbling)</i>
- (Horse neighs)

39:19.808 --> 39:21.775
- (hooting)
- (Whooshing)

39:21.810 --> 39:24.978
(horse neighing)

39:38.410 --> 39:40.460
See, I swore to King George

39:40.496 --> 39:44.081
that I would kill whoever saw this.

39:45.834 --> 39:49.253
But then I swore to another George

39:49.305 --> 39:52.756
that he would live to regret me.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.424
(Spits)

39:54.476 --> 39:58.262
Well, I suppose your body
would send that message.

40:00.015 --> 40:02.099
(Gurgling)

40:05.020 --> 40:07.604
It's not what it looks like.

40:07.656 --> 40:11.325
It looks like we're going to be hanging

40:11.360 --> 40:14.077
- Patriot conspirators.
- No, no, you got it wrong.

40:15.331 --> 40:18.916
You helped us uncover
a rebel message system.

40:18.951 --> 40:21.668
I'm not a rebel. I am not a rebel.

40:21.704 --> 40:23.203
Then why run?

40:23.205 --> 40:25.622
- (Grunts)
- Oh!

40:25.674 --> 40:28.625
(Groans)

40:28.677 --> 40:32.629
You might want to save
yourself further pain...

40:34.049 --> 40:36.300
and confess.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.553
All right, all right, I wrote the letter.

40:39.605 --> 40:43.023
I wrote the letter, but it was for
a trap to lure rebels, all right?

40:43.058 --> 40:45.108
Look, write to Major Hewlett in Setauket.

40:45.144 --> 40:48.061
He'll corroborate every word that I've said.

40:48.063 --> 40:50.530
Every word.

40:50.566 --> 40:52.199
Major Hewlett, eh?

40:52.234 --> 40:53.602
(Playing)

40:53.602 --> 40:56.835
Abe: <i> Major Edmund Hewlett
of Setauket in Long Island.</i>

40:57.957 --> 41:00.874
<i>He will confirm my mission for the king.</i>

41:05.914 --> 41:08.131
I will talk to him.

41:08.167 --> 41:10.083
This is still my house.

41:10.085 --> 41:13.670
Hewlett: <i>I believe I've got a
folio of Handel in my room.</i>

41:13.722 --> 41:15.973
It's a little more forgiving.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.926
(Playing continues)

41:27.236 --> 41:31.438
(humming)

41:34.660 --> 41:36.777
<i>(soft clatter)</i>

41:56.015 --> 41:58.632
- (groans)
- (Grunting)

42:03.835 --> 42:06.169
- Major Hewlett.
- What is this about?

42:06.169 --> 42:08.789
I am an officer in the
Royal Army. Release me.

42:08.789 --> 42:11.245
Maybe we'll just release your tongue.

42:12.583 --> 42:13.900
Make things even.

42:16.626 --> 42:17.977
Take him to the boat.

42:20.051 --> 42:21.292
Let's go.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.941
Major!
