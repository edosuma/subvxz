00:53.258 --> 00:55.328
Turn.

00:55.498 --> 01:01.016
There's another. Circuit board
epsilon 14598, red corridor 357.

01:01.178 --> 01:04.056
- Re-routed.
- Turn.

01:04.257 --> 01:08.854
And another. Circuit board theta 29555,
blue corridor 212.

01:09.058 --> 01:12.448
What's happening, guys?
I thought we were playing poker?

01:12.658 --> 01:15.297
- Didn't you get the message?
- What message?

01:15.498 --> 01:19.776
A skutter went bananas and rewired
the maintenance decks upside down.

01:19.938 --> 01:24.216
We've got over 2,000 wiring faults.
Don't breathe. Don't touch anything.

01:24.378 --> 01:28.656
- The ship's a gigantic booby trap.
- No poker, then?

01:28.818 --> 01:33.608
We can't find the auto-destruct system.
It's wired up to something. Tell the Cat.

01:34.218 --> 01:37.130
It's taken me ages to mark these cards.

01:38.218 --> 01:42.211
- We can't touch anything?
- Not until we get the all-clear.

01:42.378 --> 01:45.211
- How long's that?
- God knows.

01:45.378 --> 01:48.927
Milk shake and a crispy bar.
Poker's gone for a burton.

01:59.338 --> 02:03.331
- That was a very dumb thing to do.
- I wasn't thinking.

02:07.658 --> 02:09.535
Cancel. Clear.

02:23.418 --> 02:25.978
I said touch nothing, didn't I?

02:26.178 --> 02:28.533
I just ordered a shake and a crispy bar.

02:33.338 --> 02:37.729
- How do we switch it off?
- Only the Captain can override it.

02:37.938 --> 02:39.974
- Dead.
- Or a senior officer.

02:40.178 --> 02:42.214
- Dead.
- I suppose, really,

02:42.378 --> 02:44.812
I should have updated the system.

02:44.978 --> 02:48.448
Could we trick it
into thinking one of us is the Captain?

02:48.658 --> 02:52.094
No. It checks his voice and brain scan.

02:56.418 --> 03:00.775
Think of something. You're supposed to
have an IQ of 6,000. Think of something.

03:04.698 --> 03:08.327
- Well?
- I've collated every single option,

03:08.498 --> 03:10.568
and there are three realistic alternatives.

03:10.738 --> 03:13.206
One - sit here and get blown up.

03:13.418 --> 03:16.490
Two - stand here and get blown up.

03:16.698 --> 03:20.657
Three - jump up and down,
shout at me, then get blown up.

03:20.858 --> 03:25.409
- There must be something?
- Perhaps we could try a mind-swap?

03:28.338 --> 03:31.330
It's something we tried once on the Nova 5.

03:31.498 --> 03:34.808
It uses exactly the same science
as generating a hologram.

03:34.978 --> 03:38.766
We wipe all your brain patterns
and put them on a storage disk.

03:38.938 --> 03:44.649
Then we transfer the Captain's mind from
his hologram disk into your empty brain.

03:45.138 --> 03:47.333
- You tried this on Nova 5?
- Oh, yes.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.971
- Did it work?
- No, but I'm sure I know what went wrong.

03:55.178 --> 03:59.012
- So, I'll have the Captain's mind?
- Yes. Then, hopefully,

03:59.178 --> 04:03.251
the machine will think you're the Captain,
and you can override it.

04:04.338 --> 04:08.126
- But where will my mind be?
- On this.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.208
We couldn't find the Captain's disk,
but Brown was executive officer.

04:14.418 --> 04:16.851
Yeah. Brown's got clearance.

04:19.058 --> 04:21.572
- What's that for?
- It's a mental emetic.

04:21.778 --> 04:25.168
- A what?
- A mind enema...

04:25.338 --> 04:29.536
- To flush out your brain.
- Nobody's flushin' out my brain.

04:29.738 --> 04:33.526
- We'll transfer it back.
- You're not sticking that in my head!

04:36.138 --> 04:38.368
- It's our only chance.
- Smeg off!

04:38.578 --> 04:41.570
Look, man, I'm not asking just for me.

04:41.738 --> 04:46.209
I'm asking... I'm beggin' you,
do it for the sake of my suits.

04:46.378 --> 04:48.892
Are you gonna let my scarlet PVC morning suit

04:49.058 --> 04:53.210
with the imitation penguin-fur collars
get blown to smithereens?

04:57.618 --> 05:01.531
Look, I agree, it's a stupid idea.
It almost certainly won't work,

05:01.698 --> 05:04.815
but the very worst that can happen,
the bottom line,

05:04.978 --> 05:08.607
is that you spend the rest of your life
as a gibbering vegetable.

05:08.778 --> 05:12.407
But if the rest of your life
is 30 seconds, what the hell?

05:14.458 --> 05:16.449
Do it.

05:35.218 --> 05:38.096
Keep that safe. It's Lister's mind.

05:52.178 --> 05:55.853
- What's going on?
- No time to explain,

05:56.018 --> 06:01.012
but the auto-destruct system has started,
and we need you to deactivate it.

06:01.218 --> 06:04.574
Something's wrong. Something's different.

06:04.738 --> 06:07.536
Wait a minute, I never used to be a man!

06:08.978 --> 06:13.529
- Look, we'll explain later.
- Why have I got male sexual organs?

06:13.738 --> 06:17.287
If we don't override the auto-destruct
in the next 20 seconds,

06:17.458 --> 06:21.133
those sexual organs will be in orbit
around the nearest planet,

06:21.298 --> 06:24.131
along with every one else's organs,
sexual or otherwise.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.970
security clearance 0-1-0-1-0-1.

06:43.538 --> 06:46.530
- Sen-smegging-sational.
- Well done, fink face.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.689
- <i>Three...</i>
- What a brilliant plan.

06:48.858 --> 06:50.849
- <i>Two...</i>
- Just great.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.647
It was wired to the warning system,

07:08.818 --> 07:11.127
- but not the bomb.
- So where's the bomb?

07:11.298 --> 07:13.289
We haven't got a bomb.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.767
- What?
- I got rid of it ages ago.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.572
- Why didn't you say?
- You never asked.

07:19.338 --> 07:22.569
Fine. Terrific! But remember this -

07:22.738 --> 07:25.206
you're getting my underwear bill, buddy.

07:32.778 --> 07:35.895
- You awake?
- Yeah, can't sleep.

07:36.098 --> 07:39.534
- Probably those kippers.
- Nothin' wrong with kippers.

07:40.578 --> 07:42.614
But kippers vindaloo?

07:43.298 --> 07:47.769
It can't be good for you. A curry
every night cannot be good for you.

07:47.938 --> 07:51.328
It's certainly no good for me.
I'm thinking of getting a canary.

07:52.178 --> 07:55.853
- Why?
- To check if it's safe to come in.

07:56.378 --> 07:59.131
- It's not that bad!
- Not that bad?

07:59.338 --> 08:03.092
You don't sweat sweat, you sweat madras sauce.

08:03.298 --> 08:07.450
- Why the sudden interest in my diet?
- It's not just your diet, Lister.

08:07.618 --> 08:11.406
It's your health in general.
You eat crap, you don't exercise,

08:11.578 --> 08:14.411
you smoke, you drink...
Frankly, it's beginning to show.

08:14.618 --> 08:17.291
- I'm OK.
- You're getting porky.

08:17.978 --> 08:19.457
Porky?

08:19.618 --> 08:23.691
Last week, during that lights failure,
your silhouette was cast onto the wall.

08:23.858 --> 08:29.171
- I thought it was Alfred Hitchcock.
- Are you sayin' I've got a gut?

08:29.898 --> 08:32.571
You've got more gut
than a Turkish butcher's shop.

08:33.298 --> 08:35.368
No, really, have I put on weight?

08:36.698 --> 08:39.087
You've reached that age, Listy.

08:39.258 --> 08:41.818
When you're younger, you can eat
and drink what you like

08:42.018 --> 08:46.296
and still climb into your 26-inch-waist
trousers and zip them closed.

08:46.458 --> 08:52.169
Then you reach that age - 24, 25 -
your muscles give up, wave a white flag,

08:52.338 --> 08:55.774
then without warning,
you're suddenly a fat bastard.

08:55.978 --> 08:58.538
I'm not fat, I'm porky!

08:58.738 --> 09:01.969
Have you never held up a frog by its head?

09:02.138 --> 09:05.892
You know how its belly sticks out
above its spindly little legs?

09:06.058 --> 09:09.255
That's what I see
when you get down from the bunk.

09:09.458 --> 09:14.407
Maybe you're right. Yeah,
I'm gonna start working out in the gym.

09:14.618 --> 09:17.735
Of course, you could always...

09:17.938 --> 09:20.771
- No, you'd never agree to it.
- What?

09:20.938 --> 09:24.851
We do a swap.
My mind in your body, yours in mine.

09:25.058 --> 09:30.496
You saw how easy it was. Lend me
your body for a while, and I'll get it fit.

09:30.698 --> 09:34.771
Plenty of exercise, sensible diet,
no more booze, no more ciggies.

09:34.978 --> 09:37.617
It'll be like a 12,000-mile service
for your body.

09:37.818 --> 09:43.017
- And in the meantime, I'm a hologram?
- It's only for a couple of weeks.

09:43.178 --> 09:46.488
You're talking like it's a pair
of hedge trimmers or somethin'.

09:46.698 --> 09:50.611
I'd return it intact.
More than intact, it'd be fitter.

09:50.818 --> 09:52.968
Rimmer, you're not having my body.

09:53.138 --> 09:56.574
Why are you worried?
How can I treat it any worse?

09:56.738 --> 09:59.889
You admit you don't look after it properly.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.572
I would. What do you say?

10:15.178 --> 10:16.657
No welchin'.

10:16.818 --> 10:18.934
Of course not.

10:23.938 --> 10:26.168
- A fortnight.
- 14 days.

10:26.338 --> 10:29.774
- Two weeks.
- Absolutely-doodly.

11:07.538 --> 11:12.168
This hat is smeggin' stupid.
I look like Captain Emerald.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.250
- Holly, do somethin' about it, man.
- OK, Dave.

11:18.098 --> 11:20.089
Brutal.

11:22.618 --> 11:25.052
What's this under his nails?

11:25.218 --> 11:29.530
Oh, my God!
I'm going to have this dirt carbon dated.

11:36.018 --> 11:38.009
Luncheon, sir.

11:49.058 --> 11:52.767
Ah! Food. Real food.

11:52.938 --> 11:54.974
To eat, perchance to taste.

11:55.138 --> 12:00.053
It's exactly as you ordered, sir.
Lightly poached Mimian bladder fish,

12:00.258 --> 12:03.728
four dozen oysters,
duck's feet in abalone sauce...

12:03.938 --> 12:06.896
I can touch, I can taste, I can smell!

12:07.098 --> 12:10.773
Roast suckling pig stuffed
with chestnuts and truffles.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.929
- Mmm!
- Mashed potato.

12:14.498 --> 12:18.616
- With cream and butter?
- A pint of cream and a pound of butter.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.888
Let the orgy commence!

12:45.018 --> 12:47.293
How's the diet goin'?

12:59.858 --> 13:04.170
Do you know, I think I went temporarily
insane. It was just too much.

13:04.338 --> 13:09.492
I haven't tasted food in three million
and two years. I was like an animal.

13:09.698 --> 13:12.531
- I want my body back.
- It won't happen again.

13:12.698 --> 13:16.134
- It's out of my system.
- MY system. Why are you smoking?

13:16.338 --> 13:19.489
- One cigar!
- You should be gettin' me fit.

13:19.658 --> 13:22.218
- I'll start tomorrow.
- You better bleedin' had.

13:26.978 --> 13:29.970
Hey! What are you doin' dressed like that?

13:30.138 --> 13:33.687
Why do you want to look
like Goalpost-Head? Have you flipped?

13:33.858 --> 13:39.216
You want to look like a man with ears
so large that they pick up satellite TV?

13:39.378 --> 13:42.529
Why do you want to look
like that smeg-head Rimmer?

13:42.698 --> 13:44.814
Because...

13:44.978 --> 13:47.731
I am that smeg-head Rimmer.

13:56.498 --> 13:59.490
Please! These are supposed to be women?

14:02.218 --> 14:04.288
Ah, this is what I call training.

14:06.898 --> 14:09.935
That letter, that letter, that letter. There.

14:10.778 --> 14:14.487
Hey, hey, hey! I've got you now, buddy!

14:14.658 --> 14:17.331
J-O-Z-X-Y-Q-K.

14:17.538 --> 14:19.574
- That's not a word.
- It's a cat word.

14:20.138 --> 14:23.130
- Jozxyqk?
- That's not how you pronounce it.

14:23.338 --> 14:25.329
- What's it mean?
- It's the sound you make

14:25.498 --> 14:29.810
when you trap your sexual organs
in something - "Jozxyqk!!"

14:30.738 --> 14:33.332
- Is it in the dictionary?
- It could be.

14:33.498 --> 14:38.288
If you were reading in the nude
and closed the book too quick... "Jozxyqk!!"

14:38.458 --> 14:43.532
Ah! What a session! What a work out!
No pain, no gain, Listy.

14:43.738 --> 14:47.856
- On the scales. I'm weighing you.
- No need. See that stomach.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.327
Hasn't been that flat in years.

14:50.538 --> 14:52.893
- Scales, please.
- There's really no need.

14:53.098 --> 14:55.293
On the scales!

15:01.898 --> 15:05.174
- You've put on two stone!
- Of course I have.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.898
I've been taking yeast extract,
building up your body.

15:08.098 --> 15:09.770
- Take the robe off.
- Why?

15:09.978 --> 15:13.288
- Take it off.
- You're not seeing my naked body.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.892
- It's mine!
- What's he hiding?

15:16.058 --> 15:18.014
- Off with the robe.
- Just...

15:18.178 --> 15:19.975
Off!

15:27.538 --> 15:30.769
Oh, this? This is a hernia-prevention belt.

15:30.938 --> 15:33.327
- I forgot to take it off.
- It's a girdle.

15:33.498 --> 15:37.810
- 'Course it isn't.
- It's got dangly things for stockings.

15:38.018 --> 15:43.092
They're for attaching extra weights to,
so you can get fit as you walk around.

15:44.458 --> 15:46.449
I want me body back now.

15:47.338 --> 15:51.889
Look, OK. I went a bit bananas at first,
but that's all over now.

15:52.378 --> 15:54.733
It's in my interest to get you into shape.

15:54.938 --> 15:59.409
This could be a regular thing.
14 days a year, I have your body.

15:59.578 --> 16:03.253
In fact, next year,
I'd like the last two weeks of July.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.211
- I want it back.
- One last chance?

16:06.418 --> 16:09.330
- No more troughin'.
- I promise.

16:09.538 --> 16:13.372
And take that girdle off. It doesn't suit me.

16:37.618 --> 16:39.609
Holly, lights!

16:42.098 --> 16:44.532
That's it! I'm completely sick of it.

16:44.698 --> 16:48.088
- Mmmph? Mmmm?
- That is IT!

16:49.218 --> 16:51.607
- What is it?
- You've been porkin' again.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.770
- I have not!
- I want my body back now.

16:54.978 --> 16:59.768
- I've only had it a week!
- This wasn't the deal. You've welched.

17:01.098 --> 17:04.932
And what's this in the bin?
Me locks are in the bin!

17:05.098 --> 17:09.648
- You said you pinned 'em up?
- I did but they...fell off.

17:09.858 --> 17:12.291
Fell off? Science lab, now!

17:12.657 --> 17:15.455
It's the middle of the night. Kryten's on down time.

17:16.698 --> 17:18.689
Now.

17:35.298 --> 17:39.086
How much did you smoke? Me lungs feel
like they've been through a cheese grater!

17:39.258 --> 17:43.649
- You got your body back. Leave me alone.
- Oh!

17:43.818 --> 17:45.809
I only have a few rollies.

17:45.978 --> 17:49.254
It feels like you've smoked
an entire Cuban tobacco harvest.

17:49.418 --> 17:52.888
- I had the odd one.
- No respect, that's what.

17:53.058 --> 17:55.333
You've shown my body no respect whatsoever.

17:55.498 --> 17:58.058
You've treated it like smeg.

17:58.618 --> 18:01.576
Look... You've given me breasts.

18:01.738 --> 18:04.616
There's a distinct cleavage there.

18:04.778 --> 18:08.566
One week in my body
and you've given me a bosom.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.294
These scales are wrong.
These scales have to be wrong.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.449
It's average for your height.

18:18.618 --> 18:23.692
Rimmer, it would be average for my height
if I happened to be a pregnant hippo.

18:23.858 --> 18:27.897
You weren't exactly Charles Atlas
to start with, were you?

18:28.058 --> 18:30.652
You haven't been treating my athlete's foot.

18:30.858 --> 18:32.928
Frankly, I was afraid of touching it.

18:33.138 --> 18:38.132
I told you, you have to wash and powder
my feet three times a day,

18:38.298 --> 18:40.289
and buff with a pumice stone.

18:40.498 --> 18:44.047
I couldn't touch those things three times a day.

18:44.218 --> 18:47.210
I was only brave enough
to remove your socks once.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.773
Look at my stomach. Look at it!

18:49.938 --> 18:53.169
Paint "Goodyear" on it,
you could float me over the Super Bowl.

18:53.378 --> 18:56.211
Look, I refuse to take the rap for that body.

18:56.378 --> 18:59.370
I added a few pounds to its already ample frame,

18:59.538 --> 19:02.655
but it was a wreck before I got anywhere near it.

19:02.858 --> 19:04.211
A wreck?

19:04.378 --> 19:08.417
If it was a car you would be
an insurance write-off. Nothing works.

19:08.578 --> 19:10.728
Your taste buds are clapped out.

19:10.898 --> 19:14.607
You've killed them stone dead
with 25 years of non-stop curries.

19:15.258 --> 19:20.252
All the aches and pains you never mention?
Twinges in your back, crimps in your neck.

19:20.418 --> 19:24.570
Oh, and a little tip - urine should
only be green if you're Mr Spock.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.531
It's the last time you borrow it,
that's for goddamn sure.

19:29.338 --> 19:33.047
What about next year?
We agreed. Last two weeks in July.

19:33.218 --> 19:35.857
Why do you want it? It's a wreck.

19:36.018 --> 19:39.374
Unfortunately, if you can't get
two weeks in the Caribbean,

19:39.538 --> 19:41.608
Grimsby's better than nothing.

19:41.778 --> 19:45.168
- You can't back out.
- I only said that to get it back.

19:45.338 --> 19:50.173
Do you think I'm mad? You are never
borrowing my body again. Never.

19:50.378 --> 19:54.087
Get some sleep.
You'll feel different in the morning.

19:55.538 --> 19:57.768
I'm really not sure about this.

19:57.938 --> 20:00.577
You're programmed to obey. Get on with it.

20:00.738 --> 20:03.810
- Surely, we should ask him first?
- I told you,

20:03.978 --> 20:06.173
he's perfectly happy about the situation.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.808
Then, why did we chloroform him?
And why did he struggle?

20:09.978 --> 20:12.731
I'm in charge, Kryten. I'll take full responsibility.

20:12.898 --> 20:15.617
- But, sir...
- Science lab, pronto!

20:15.778 --> 20:18.497
If he comes around, give him another whack.

20:34.338 --> 20:37.011
Are you awake, man?

20:37.818 --> 20:39.410
Rimmer?

20:41.498 --> 20:46.128
No, please. No! Play message.

20:59.178 --> 21:01.897
<i>That's why I've taken Starbug and done a runner.</i>

21:12.618 --> 21:14.654
Cat. Cat!

21:19.498 --> 21:21.489
You want my what?!

21:21.658 --> 21:25.367
- It'll only take a few hours.
- You want my body?

21:25.538 --> 21:28.098
I need your body to get mine back.

21:28.258 --> 21:34.208
You've already lost one body. Come on!
You really expect me to lend you mine?

21:34.378 --> 21:39.532
I'm a hologram. How else am I supposed
to chase him? I need your body.

21:39.698 --> 21:45.455
One question. Would you let a garbage
truck driver use your Rolls-Royce?

21:45.618 --> 21:48.212
How else can I pilot White Midget?

21:48.378 --> 21:50.369
I'll do it.

22:32.018 --> 22:36.614
- <i>Turn around and head back to the ship.</i>
- I told you not to follow me.

22:40.458 --> 22:43.495
<i>Leave me alone or you-know-what happens.</i>

22:46.658 --> 22:51.334
I think he means it, man. He's flipped.
It must be cream cake poisoning.

22:51.498 --> 22:54.171
- I'm going in.
- He must be bluffing.

22:54.378 --> 22:57.336
- Say he isn't?
- It's gastronomic terrorism!

22:57.498 --> 23:01.207
- We can't just let it happen.
- <i>Go ahead, punks. Make my day.</i>

23:01.938 --> 23:04.247
- You're right. He's bluffin'.
- <i>Smeg</i>

23:04.458 --> 23:06.574
Get him!

23:23.218 --> 23:25.812
This is getting stupid. Back off, let him go.

23:26.018 --> 23:30.933
- We're almost on him.
- It's too dangerous. Let him go.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.735
Chickens!

23:48.378 --> 23:49.891
Oh, smeg!

23:50.058 --> 23:54.097
What the smeggin' smeg's
he smeggin' done? He's smeggin' killed me!

24:08.258 --> 24:10.726
- Whoops!
- Are you all right?

24:10.898 --> 24:13.776
- You're going to go spare.
- What is it?

24:13.978 --> 24:16.617
You're going to go absolutely spare.

24:17.898 --> 24:21.937
- You've lost me arm!
- I've lost your watch too.

24:23.178 --> 24:26.295
- You bastard!
- No, you're right. It's my fault.

24:26.498 --> 24:29.376
My hands are up... Well, my hand is up!

24:31.418 --> 24:33.409
You think this is funny?

24:33.578 --> 24:35.614
No. But this is!

24:52.498 --> 24:54.773
Oh, hello. It's Captain Chloroform.

24:55.658 --> 24:57.774
Please, Mr David, sir.

24:57.938 --> 25:02.568
My guilt chip is already in overdrive.
I feel terrible!

25:03.378 --> 25:05.892
You feel terrible? What about my head?

25:06.098 --> 25:12.970
I had to obey him. It's in my programming
to obey all humans, no matter how insane.

25:14.538 --> 25:16.608
Dinner is served, sir.

25:17.978 --> 25:21.812
Lettuce and a grated carrot.
I'm on this for six months.

25:25.018 --> 25:27.657
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

25:27.858 --> 25:30.292
I was asleep, OK?

25:30.458 --> 25:35.088
Then Plastic Percy puts a sponge
on my face and out go the lights.

25:36.218 --> 25:38.049
It was an order!

25:39.818 --> 25:42.491
Just one night, I promise.

25:42.658 --> 25:47.288
I'll give it back first thing tomorrow.
Maybe Thursday.
