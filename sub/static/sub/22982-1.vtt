00:39.030 --> 00:41.230

00:52.150 --> 00:54.630
To see

00:54.670 --> 00:56.670
You make

00:56.710 --> 01:00.470
My life so glamorous

01:00.470 --> 01:04.629
You can't blame me
for feeling amorous

01:05.590 --> 01:08.470
Now, is this
a bit of terrific, hmm?

01:09.750 --> 01:14.030
Last night, she was banging
on my door for 45 minutes...

01:14.070 --> 01:15.070
but I wouldn't let her out.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.950
'S wonderful

01:25.990 --> 01:29.070
'S marvelous

01:29.110 --> 01:35.990
That you should care for me

01:40.950 --> 01:42.870
Don't worry. I'll get the mail.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.110
I'll get it.

01:44.150 --> 01:46.670
Uh-oh. Speaking of my mo...

01:46.710 --> 01:47.950
I have an amazing mother.

01:47.990 --> 01:51.950
You know, she's 85 years old,
and she don't need glasses.

01:51.990 --> 01:53.030
She drinks
right out of the bottle.

01:54.870 --> 01:56.510
She don't even
open them anymore.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.830
She goes
right through the label.

02:00.590 --> 02:01.990
Oh, and drinking?

02:02.030 --> 02:03.910
My doctor said,
"Stop drinking"...

02:03.950 --> 02:05.910
so I'm not gonna drink anymore.

02:05.950 --> 02:09.190
I'm gonna freeze it now
and eat it like a Popsicle.

02:13.470 --> 02:15.910
'S wonderful

02:15.950 --> 02:18.790
'S marvelous

02:18.830 --> 02:21.190
You should care

02:21.230 --> 02:22.150

02:22.190 --> 02:23.590
2, 3, 4.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.190
To see

02:33.230 --> 02:35.110
I guess you all know
this is my last night here.

02:35.150 --> 02:36.550
Tomorrow morning
I'm going to Hollywood...

02:36.590 --> 02:37.670
and make a new picture...

02:37.710 --> 02:40.190
me, Frank Sinatra,
Sammy Davis Jr...

02:40.230 --> 02:41.710
and Joey Bishop...

02:41.750 --> 02:43.150
called "Little Women."

02:44.750 --> 02:46.630
But before that,
I'm gonna do a TV special...

02:46.670 --> 02:48.070
with Mr. Bing Crosby.

02:48.110 --> 02:50.070
Now, why Bing works so hard,
I'll never know.

02:50.110 --> 02:52.390
He's got $21 million...

02:52.430 --> 02:53.950
on him.

03:03.990 --> 03:05.870
My dear

03:05.910 --> 03:09.390
It's four-leaf clover time

03:09.430 --> 03:13.110
From now on,
my heart's working overtime

03:15.030 --> 03:16.390
I don't care
who you are, fat man.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.190
You get them reindeers
off my roof.

03:20.270 --> 03:22.830
'S wonderful

03:22.870 --> 03:25.550
'S marvelous

03:25.590 --> 03:27.630

03:27.670 --> 03:32.310
For me

03:33.270 --> 03:34.670
Good night! Good night!

03:34.710 --> 03:36.430
See you next year!

03:40.630 --> 03:42.190
Great, Dino. Only great.

03:42.230 --> 03:43.990
They were rolling in the aisles.

03:44.030 --> 03:46.230
Why didn't somebody
take their dice away?

03:47.510 --> 03:48.470
Dino.

03:48.510 --> 03:49.430
Hmm?

03:49.470 --> 03:51.230
Am I going to see you
before you leave?

03:51.270 --> 03:52.750
Just one last nightcap?

03:52.790 --> 03:53.790
You got it.

03:53.830 --> 03:55.750
I'll be in my room.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.190
Keep your hat on.

03:59.110 --> 04:00.510
What's her name? Mitzi?

04:00.550 --> 04:01.950
No, no. Sylvia.

04:01.990 --> 04:03.030
Sylvia.

04:03.070 --> 04:04.990
This one is Mitzi.

04:05.030 --> 04:05.950
Dino.

04:05.990 --> 04:06.910
Hmm?

04:06.950 --> 04:08.830
Are we going to
get together tonight?

04:08.870 --> 04:10.870
Just one for the road, huh?

04:10.910 --> 04:11.870
It's a must.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.870
My room later, OK?

04:14.870 --> 04:16.750
This is beginning to look
like Custer's last stand.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.709
Like what?

04:17.750 --> 04:19.630
Because it isn't
just Sylvia and Mitzi.

04:19.670 --> 04:20.950
There are all those
other Indians.

04:20.950 --> 04:22.270
You've got Janet
in the dressing room...

04:22.310 --> 04:23.670
Juicy Lucy up in your suite...

04:23.670 --> 04:24.630
and those German twins...

04:24.630 --> 04:25.830
waiting for you
in the steam room.

04:25.870 --> 04:26.950
That's the whole idea.

04:26.990 --> 04:29.230
Now that I got everybody
stashed away, I can beat it.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.150
So you pack my stuff
and put it in the car.

04:31.190 --> 04:32.390
You're going to leave
just like that,

04:32.430 --> 04:33.670
without saying good-bye?

04:33.710 --> 04:34.990
Damn right, because
if I start saying good-bye...

04:35.030 --> 04:35.950
to all these dames,

04:35.990 --> 04:38.390
you'll have to carry me
out of here...

04:38.430 --> 04:42.070
what's left of me...
in a cigar box...

04:42.110 --> 04:43.310
baby.

05:23.030 --> 05:24.470
What's the matter?

05:24.470 --> 05:26.230
That Sinatra kid missing again?

05:26.270 --> 05:28.150
We had a bad pileup
down the highway.

05:28.190 --> 05:30.190
You'll have to take the detour.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.470
Where does that lead to?

05:31.510 --> 05:34.830
You come out at Barstow,
by way of Warm Springs...

05:34.870 --> 05:37.550
Paradise Valley, and Climax.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.030
That's the only way to go.

06:22.710 --> 06:23.670
Fill 'er up?

06:23.670 --> 06:26.110
Yeah. No, no. Over here.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.550
Anything else?

06:34.590 --> 06:35.990
No, thanks.

06:38.590 --> 06:41.230
Hey! You forgot
your green stamps!

06:47.470 --> 06:48.510
Hi, Barney!

07:32.310 --> 07:34.790
Deedle, deedle, deedle

07:34.830 --> 07:37.430
Deedle, deedle, deedle

07:37.470 --> 07:40.030
Deedle, deedle, d...

07:40.070 --> 07:41.430
No, no, Mulligan.

07:41.470 --> 07:43.670
You've got an extra
deedle in there.

07:43.710 --> 07:45.590
It's six deedles, not seven.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.470
Let's not monkey around
with Beethoven, shall we?

07:48.510 --> 07:50.390
Once more.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.230
Orville.

07:54.230 --> 07:55.670
Yes, dear?

07:55.670 --> 07:56.910
What's the matter?

07:59.990 --> 08:02.390
Please, dear, not now.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.110
Mulligan, not only
do you have a tin ear...

08:56.150 --> 08:57.230
you have lead fingers.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.030
Whoever told you
to take up the piano?

08:59.070 --> 09:00.430
You did, sir.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.750
Well, I need the money,
but what's your excuse?

09:02.790 --> 09:05.430
It says here
molto espressione...

09:05.470 --> 09:07.470
which means with much
expression...

09:07.510 --> 09:09.950
with feeling, with heart.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.110
From the top again.

10:02.390 --> 10:03.350
A-natural!

10:03.350 --> 10:05.030
A-natural!

10:08.630 --> 10:09.870
Just a minute, you.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.870
Oh, hi there, Mr. Spooner.

10:10.870 --> 10:11.830
Don't you "hi there" me.

10:11.870 --> 10:14.470
I know your type,
sneaking around to back doors.

10:14.510 --> 10:15.950
All right, let's have it.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.070
Have what?

10:17.110 --> 10:18.030
That note my wife left you.

10:18.070 --> 10:20.510
You must think I'm blind
or stupid or something.

10:20.550 --> 10:22.590
Oh, yeah, the... sure.
The note.

10:22.630 --> 10:25.190
She wanted, uh, two quarts
of milk and a dozen eggs.

10:25.230 --> 10:28.830
A likely story.

10:28.870 --> 10:32.390
"Two quarts of milk.
One dozen eggs."

10:32.430 --> 10:33.630
What's it all about?

10:33.670 --> 10:35.030
I'll tell you
what it's all about.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.230
It's about, um...

10:36.270 --> 10:37.230
buttermilk!

10:37.270 --> 10:38.430
And she forgot
to order buttermilk.

10:38.470 --> 10:39.390
She always forgets.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.350
She doesn't like buttermilk,
but I like buttermilk.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.710
There's nothing
like buttermilk...

10:42.710 --> 10:45.150
especially if you
have a lazy colon.

10:45.190 --> 10:46.510
Excuse me.

11:06.550 --> 11:07.910
No, no, no, Mulligan.

11:07.950 --> 11:09.590
Now you're leaving out
a deedle.

11:09.630 --> 11:11.590
There are six deedles, not five.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.030
Orville!

11:19.550 --> 11:21.430
Yes, lambchop?

11:21.430 --> 11:23.550
Zip me up, will you, please?

11:23.590 --> 11:24.510
Going somewhere?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.750
Yes, and I'm late.

11:25.790 --> 11:27.150
I don't want
to keep him waiting.

11:27.190 --> 11:29.710
Of course not. Him? Whom?

11:29.750 --> 11:30.830
The dentist.

11:30.870 --> 11:32.310
Oh. You got a toothache?

11:32.350 --> 11:33.750
No. Time to have
my teeth cleaned.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.870
You just had them cleaned.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.150
I have to go in
every three months.

11:36.190 --> 11:39.150
Dr. Sheldrake says I have
very tender gums.

11:39.190 --> 11:41.630
Oh, he does, does he?

11:41.670 --> 11:42.830
Bye, darling.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.310
Bye.

11:44.310 --> 11:45.590
Where did you get those flowers?

11:45.630 --> 11:47.230
They're from Johnnie.

11:48.590 --> 11:50.550
I picked them myself.

11:50.590 --> 11:51.870
Isn't he sweet?

11:51.910 --> 11:53.070
Yes, isn't he?

11:53.110 --> 11:54.830
Well, I'm off.

11:54.870 --> 11:56.630
See you, Johnnie.

12:35.550 --> 12:37.550
How old are you, Mulligan?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.750
Fourteen... going on fifteen.

12:43.710 --> 12:45.710
Pretty big for your age,
aren't you?

12:45.750 --> 12:47.510
That's what they tell me.

12:53.510 --> 12:55.310
You stay away from my wife,
do you hear me?

12:55.350 --> 12:56.270
What?

12:56.310 --> 12:57.750
Pussyfooting around
behind my back!

12:57.790 --> 12:59.750
Bringing flowers
to a married woman!

12:59.790 --> 13:01.270
Let go of me!

13:08.830 --> 13:10.710
You ought to be horsewhipped!

13:15.030 --> 13:17.910
And don't you ever
come back here again...

13:18.870 --> 13:19.870
you teenage wolf!

13:21.510 --> 13:23.790
You male Lolita!

13:24.950 --> 13:26.030
Orville!

13:27.070 --> 13:28.670
Hey, you, Orville!

13:38.590 --> 13:42.110
Listen to this!
I think I got it. I...

13:42.150 --> 13:44.750
Are you ready?
I'm a poached egg.

13:44.790 --> 13:45.750
You're a what?

13:45.750 --> 13:46.870
I'm a poached egg.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.510
That's it... the title
of the song.

13:48.550 --> 13:49.470
What song?

13:49.510 --> 13:50.510
The one you played me yesterday.

13:52.150 --> 13:53.070
Oh, that one.

13:53.110 --> 13:54.070
I got the whole lyric
worked out.

13:54.110 --> 13:55.030
You want to hear it?

13:55.070 --> 13:55.990
Not now, Barney.

13:56.030 --> 13:56.950
I got other things on my mind.

13:56.990 --> 13:57.910
Oh, come on. Come on.

13:57.950 --> 13:58.870
I'm not in the mood.

13:58.910 --> 14:00.430
It's a dilly, I'll tell you.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.390
Give me a pickup.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.430
I'm a poached egg

14:07.470 --> 14:08.830
Without a piece of toast

14:08.870 --> 14:10.990
Yorkshire pudding

14:11.030 --> 14:12.270
Without a beef to roast

14:12.310 --> 14:14.230
I'm a haunted house

14:14.270 --> 14:16.190
That hasn't got a ghost

14:16.230 --> 14:18.310
When I'm without you

14:18.350 --> 14:19.430
Brilliant?

14:20.390 --> 14:22.310
I'm a mousetrap

14:22.350 --> 14:23.750
Without a piece of cheese

14:23.790 --> 14:25.750
I'm Vienna

14:25.790 --> 14:27.190
Without the Viennese

14:27.230 --> 14:29.270
I'm da Vinci

14:29.310 --> 14:31.150
Without the Mona Lis

14:31.190 --> 14:32.350
When I'm...

14:32.390 --> 14:33.990
Mona Lis?

14:34.030 --> 14:35.830
That's what makes it...

14:35.870 --> 14:37.310
the irregularity...

14:37.350 --> 14:40.590
that unexpected little twist.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.510
Keep playing.

14:42.550 --> 14:44.350
It's ridiculous.

14:44.390 --> 14:45.390
What do you mean ridiculous?

14:45.430 --> 14:47.630
I mean this whole
songwriting business.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.630
What are we knocking
ourselves out for?

14:49.670 --> 14:50.670
We must have written
fifty songs by now.

14:50.710 --> 14:51.630
Sixty-two.

14:51.670 --> 14:53.390
And what's happened? Nothing.

14:53.430 --> 14:54.550
We write them. I copy them.

14:54.590 --> 14:56.150
We send them out to
all the publishers...

14:56.190 --> 14:58.230
and the record companies
and the singers...

14:58.270 --> 14:59.750
Tony Bennett,
Barbra Streisand...

14:59.790 --> 15:01.550
Nat "King" Cole,
the Four Freshmen.

15:01.590 --> 15:03.310
And do we ever hear
from any of them?

15:03.350 --> 15:05.070
No! They just steal
the stamps...

15:05.110 --> 15:07.350
from the return
self-addressed envelopes.

15:07.390 --> 15:09.350
Are we gonna
go through that again?

15:09.390 --> 15:10.630
Irving Berlin wrote
a hundred songs...

15:10.670 --> 15:13.150
before he hit it with
"Alexander's Ragtime Band."

15:13.190 --> 15:15.990
And what about George Gershwin
and Richard Rodgers?

15:16.030 --> 15:17.110
But they were professionals...

15:17.150 --> 15:20.670
and we're amateurs buried here
in Climax, Nevada.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.670
Where do you think
Cole Porter came from?

15:22.710 --> 15:24.150
Peru, Indiana.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.230
Hank Mancini?
Aliquippa, Pennsylvania.

15:26.270 --> 15:28.470
Johnny Mercer?
Savannah, Georgia.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.670
And he only won
four Academy Awards.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.830
So play!

15:36.670 --> 15:38.550
I'm Las Vegas

15:38.590 --> 15:39.990
Without a slot machine

15:39.990 --> 15:41.990
I'm a gypsy

15:42.030 --> 15:43.390
Without a tambourine

15:43.430 --> 15:45.310
I'm Napoleon

15:45.350 --> 15:47.030
Without a Josephine

15:47.070 --> 15:49.270
When I'm without you

15:49.310 --> 15:52.270
Gets better
all the time, huh?

15:52.310 --> 15:54.230
I'm a doctor

15:54.270 --> 15:55.670
Without a single pill

15:55.670 --> 15:57.630
I'm a lawyer

15:57.670 --> 15:59.110
Who never drew a will

15:59.150 --> 16:00.710
I'm a dentist

16:00.750 --> 16:02.830
Without a tooth to fill

16:02.870 --> 16:03.870
When I'm...

16:07.430 --> 16:09.270
Tender gums.

16:09.310 --> 16:12.390
That's a hell of a thing
to say to a married woman.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.910
Oh, what are you talking about?

16:14.950 --> 16:16.190
It's that new dentist.

16:16.230 --> 16:17.630
I can't keep her
away from the place.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.510
She's there right now,
in the chair.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.990
He's tilting her
all the way back.

16:22.030 --> 16:23.670
He's giving her laughing gas.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.790
She's laughing.
He's laughing, too!

16:25.830 --> 16:27.550
They're both laughing...
at me!

16:27.590 --> 16:28.510
Relax, will you, Orville?

16:28.550 --> 16:29.670
You'll drive yourself crazy.

16:29.710 --> 16:30.830
Dr. Sheldrake.

16:30.870 --> 16:31.830
Sheldrake.

16:31.870 --> 16:33.150
Dr. Sheldrake. Dr. Sheldrake.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.150
Sheldrake.

16:35.350 --> 16:37.630
Did you hear the one
about the nearsighted turtle...

16:37.670 --> 16:39.390
who fell in love with a helmet?

16:44.630 --> 16:47.230
Then there's the one
about the nearsighted snake...

16:47.270 --> 16:48.870
who proposed
to a piece of rope!

16:52.750 --> 16:54.150
Hello?

16:54.190 --> 16:55.750
This is Dr. Sheldrake.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.430
I told you. Listen to them.

17:00.470 --> 17:01.870
I know what
you're laughing at...

17:01.910 --> 17:02.830
you and my wife,

17:02.870 --> 17:05.310
and I'm going to report you
to the Dental Association!

17:05.349 --> 17:07.950
Who is this?

17:07.990 --> 17:09.230
This is the husband...

17:09.270 --> 17:10.349
and you're not
kidding me for a second.

17:10.390 --> 17:12.510
I know what you're doing to her.

17:12.550 --> 17:15.550
I'm putting an inlay
in her lower left bicuspid.

17:15.589 --> 17:18.510
I thought so.
Let me talk to her.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.710
Mrs. Mulligan,
your husband on the phone.

17:20.750 --> 17:21.670
Mrs. Mulligan?

17:21.710 --> 17:22.750
I don't want to talk
to Mrs. Mulligan.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.670
I want to talk
to Mrs. Spooner!

17:24.710 --> 17:26.790
Mrs. Spooner? She isn't here.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.830
Her appointment
isn't till next Wednesday.

17:28.870 --> 17:30.630
Next Wednesday?

17:30.670 --> 17:33.230
Oh! I'll give her the message
when she comes home.

17:33.270 --> 17:36.310
You were right.
I was worrying about nothing.

17:36.350 --> 17:37.830
She isn't even there.

17:37.870 --> 17:39.230
You nut!

17:41.750 --> 17:43.750
I'm a bullfight

17:43.790 --> 17:45.110
Without a matador

17:45.150 --> 17:47.110
I'm a heckler

17:47.150 --> 17:48.550
Who never gets the floor

17:48.590 --> 17:50.350
Casanova

17:50.390 --> 17:52.110
The night he didn't score

17:52.150 --> 17:53.110
Each time...

17:54.710 --> 17:56.950
Why isn't she there?
Where is she?

17:56.990 --> 17:57.910
Why was she lying to me?

17:57.950 --> 17:59.710
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Orville.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.270
It's Johnnie Mulligan,
of course.

18:01.310 --> 18:02.870
His mother's at the dentist...

18:02.910 --> 18:04.790
he's at home alone, and
she's with him!

18:04.830 --> 18:08.070
Johnnie Mulligan? Come off it.
He ain't even shaving yet.

18:11.830 --> 18:15.630
The milkman! He's shaving.
It must be some kind of code.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.790
A dozen eggs... that's twelve.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.150
They're meeting behind
the dairy at 12:00.

18:20.190 --> 18:21.830
Now you're running amok.

18:21.870 --> 18:23.750
You can't go around
suspecting everybody.

18:25.630 --> 18:27.630
Sometimes I'm not even
so sure about you.

18:27.670 --> 18:28.710
Me?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.550
I'm scared, Barney.
I'll tell you, I'm scared.

18:30.590 --> 18:32.110
I'm married to
the prettiest girl in town...

18:32.150 --> 18:33.350
and she's gonna leave me
one of these days.

18:33.390 --> 18:34.310
I just know it.

18:34.350 --> 18:35.510
- She will?
- Yes, she will.

18:35.550 --> 18:37.430
And you know why?
Because you're a nobody.

18:37.470 --> 18:39.350
Giving piano lessons
for a buck and a quarter.

18:39.390 --> 18:41.950
Maybe once a week you play
a wedding or a funeral.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.270
Big deal.

18:43.310 --> 18:46.070
Why, a beautiful girl like that,
she should be spoiled.

18:46.110 --> 18:48.110
A touch of mink,
fun in Acapulco...

18:48.150 --> 18:49.230
breakfast at Tiffany's!

18:49.270 --> 18:50.430
Fat chance.

18:50.470 --> 18:53.270
Orville, all it takes
is one hit, just one hit.

18:53.310 --> 18:54.710
"How Much is That Doggie
in the Window?"...

18:54.710 --> 18:55.670
three million records.

18:55.710 --> 18:58.350
"White Christmas"...
eight million records.

18:58.390 --> 19:01.030
You think Irving Berlin's
afraid of losing his wife?

19:01.070 --> 19:01.990
No, I guess not.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.070
That's why you got to keep

19:03.110 --> 19:04.830
putting those
nickels in the slot.

19:04.870 --> 19:07.550
Because you never know when
you're gonna hit the jackpot.

19:07.590 --> 19:10.150
Yeah. I guess so.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.270
Well, then, let's go.

19:14.790 --> 19:16.430
I'm a poached egg

19:16.470 --> 19:17.790
Without a piece of toast

19:17.830 --> 19:19.510
Yorkshire pudding

19:19.550 --> 19:20.990
Without a beef to roast

19:21.030 --> 19:22.750
I'm a haunted house

19:22.790 --> 19:24.230
That hasn't got a ghost

19:24.270 --> 19:26.630
When I'm without you

19:32.310 --> 19:33.230
I'm a mousetrap

19:33.270 --> 19:35.470
Hey! Hey!

19:35.510 --> 19:36.910
I'm Vienna

19:36.950 --> 19:37.870
Without the Viennese

19:37.910 --> 19:38.990
I'm da Vinci

19:39.990 --> 19:41.390
Without the Mona Lis

19:41.430 --> 19:42.950
When I'm without you

19:42.990 --> 19:44.590
You know, I'm beginning
to like that Mona Lis.

19:44.630 --> 19:45.710
What did I tell you?

19:48.470 --> 19:51.630
Aw, hold it, mister!
I'm coming.

19:51.670 --> 19:53.510
Stay with it, will you?

20:01.790 --> 20:02.870
What'll it be?

20:02.910 --> 20:06.590
A shave and a haircut.
The works, baby.

20:23.030 --> 20:23.950
Hey.

20:24.950 --> 20:25.870
What's the matter?

20:25.910 --> 20:26.870
You know who you are?

20:26.910 --> 20:29.230
Sure. I'm the greatest.
I'm the prettiest.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.230
Y-y...

20:31.270 --> 20:33.030
What do you do for
cigarettes around here, huh?

20:33.070 --> 20:35.830
- Cigarettes?
- Yeah.

20:35.870 --> 20:37.190
Hmm.

20:40.910 --> 20:42.590
Or...

20:42.630 --> 20:43.870
Orville!

20:43.910 --> 20:46.110
Hey, Orville!

20:50.510 --> 20:52.390
Come here quick!

20:54.070 --> 20:55.630
You know, I've been here
for five years...

20:55.670 --> 20:57.670
but this is the first time
that anybody...

20:57.710 --> 20:58.830
oh, sure, back in '61...

20:58.870 --> 21:00.830
Liberace pulled in here
with a flat tire...

21:00.870 --> 21:04.950
but we never had anybody
that's somebody like you.

21:04.990 --> 21:06.550
Where's the men's room?

21:08.630 --> 21:09.590
Oh.

21:09.590 --> 21:10.750
Wait a minute.

21:10.790 --> 21:12.310
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

21:12.350 --> 21:13.790
Orville, look who we got here!

21:13.830 --> 21:15.230
Who?

21:15.270 --> 21:17.390
It's Dino!

21:17.430 --> 21:19.550
Oh! How do you do?

21:19.590 --> 21:20.510
This is Orville Spooner.

21:20.550 --> 21:23.030
He plays the piano and the organ
at the church.

21:23.070 --> 21:24.750
Oh, he's a terrific musician.

21:24.790 --> 21:25.710
Well...

21:25.750 --> 21:26.670
the face is familiar.

21:26.710 --> 21:27.790
Oh?

21:27.830 --> 21:29.310
Not yours, his.

21:29.350 --> 21:30.470
Oh.

21:30.510 --> 21:32.750
OK if I go
to the john now?

21:36.790 --> 21:39.630
Orville, this is it.
This is our jackpot.

21:39.670 --> 21:42.190
Remember "That's Amore"?...
top single for 37 weeks.

21:42.230 --> 21:43.470
Or "Memories are Made
of This"?...

21:43.510 --> 21:45.630
over two million copies!

21:45.670 --> 21:47.910
And he's got his own
recording company.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.630
I'll run over and get
some of our songs!

21:49.670 --> 21:50.990
No, no, no. That's
not the way to do it.

21:51.030 --> 21:52.510
You got to be more subtle.

21:52.550 --> 21:53.990
Subtle?

21:54.070 --> 21:56.270
Just start singing him
one of our tunes, casual-like.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.950
Or hum a little. Catch his ear.

21:57.990 --> 21:58.950
I see.

21:58.990 --> 22:01.230
What are you waiting for? Go!

22:11.590 --> 22:13.070
I'm a poached egg

22:13.110 --> 22:14.630
Without a piece of toast

22:14.670 --> 22:15.950
Yorkshire pudding

22:15.990 --> 22:17.350
Without a beef to roast

22:17.390 --> 22:19.070
I'm a haunted house

22:19.110 --> 22:20.550
That hasn't got a ghost

22:20.630 --> 22:22.870
When I'm without you

22:36.030 --> 22:37.670
I'm a western

22:37.710 --> 22:39.510
Without a hitching post

22:39.550 --> 22:42.470
There's paper towels
in the ladies' room.

22:58.190 --> 22:59.870
I'm a mousetrap

22:59.910 --> 23:01.230
Without a piece of cheese

23:01.270 --> 23:02.830
I'm da Vinci

23:02.870 --> 23:04.390
Without the Mona Lis

23:04.430 --> 23:06.430
Mona Lis?

23:13.910 --> 23:15.150
I'm Las Vegas

23:15.190 --> 23:16.390
Without a slot machine

23:16.430 --> 23:17.750
I'm Napoleon

23:17.790 --> 23:19.390
Without a Josephine

23:19.430 --> 23:20.430
What's with him?

23:20.470 --> 23:22.230
Catchy tune, isn't it?
We wrote it together.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.470
- No.
- Yeah.

23:23.510 --> 23:24.950
We're gonna call it
"I'm a Poached Egg."

23:24.950 --> 23:29.110
I'm a poached... cuckoo.
How much do I owe you?

23:29.150 --> 23:31.150
$5.15. Too bad
you're in such a hurry...

23:31.190 --> 23:33.110
because if we had just
a little more time...

23:33.110 --> 23:34.550
Here you are.

23:34.550 --> 23:38.030
100? Oh, I can't change this.
I'll have to run to the bank.

23:38.070 --> 23:39.630
Why don't you have a cup
of coffee with Orville?

23:39.670 --> 23:40.630
Get acquainted.

23:40.630 --> 23:41.630
We've got a lot of songs...

23:41.670 --> 23:43.950
and they really sound
better on the piano.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.150
Uh, just a minute.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.030
Here, here. Here's $10.

23:47.030 --> 23:48.630
Keep the change.

23:50.390 --> 23:51.470
Oh, wait!

23:51.510 --> 23:54.030
I forgot to check the oil.

23:54.070 --> 23:56.510
You know, uh, "I Left My Heart
in San Francisco?"

23:56.550 --> 23:57.590
Big hit, right?

23:57.630 --> 23:58.550
They stole it from us.

23:58.590 --> 23:59.470
Is that so?

23:59.510 --> 24:00.910
We wrote it first,
only it was called...

24:00.950 --> 24:02.470
"I Left My Heart
in San Diego."

24:02.510 --> 24:04.830
Exactly the same idea.

24:04.870 --> 24:06.830
We just missed by a few miles.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.230
All set.

24:11.270 --> 24:13.150
We also have an
Italian-type song...

24:13.190 --> 24:14.630
like "Volare," only better.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.270
It would be just perfect
for you.

24:16.310 --> 24:17.270
Shove it in an envelope...

24:17.270 --> 24:18.910
and send it to
my office in Hollywood.

24:19.870 --> 24:21.630
Oh, no. All you guys want to
do...

24:21.670 --> 24:24.550
is steal those return stamps!

24:24.590 --> 24:29.230
Aww, the hell with him.
He sings flat anyway.

24:29.270 --> 24:31.510
Flat, sharp, or round...
he sells, doesn't he?

24:31.550 --> 24:33.270
Yeah. I guess we muffed it.

24:33.310 --> 24:35.990
Who knows when we'll get
a chance like this again?

24:36.030 --> 24:38.390
Oh, I'd say
in about three minutes.

24:38.390 --> 24:39.350
Three minutes?

24:39.350 --> 24:40.750
I disconnected his fuel line.

24:40.790 --> 24:41.710
He's got enough gas
in the carburetor...

24:41.750 --> 24:44.470
to go a couple blocks.

24:44.510 --> 24:45.430
Cuckoo!

24:45.470 --> 24:46.390
Yeah. Right now he's stalled...

24:46.430 --> 24:47.910
on the corner
of Citrus and Yucca.

24:47.990 --> 24:49.470
He's going into Pringle's
hardware store.

24:49.510 --> 24:51.470
He's asking if he
could use the phone.

24:51.510 --> 24:54.790
We should be hearing from him
in about ten seconds.

24:54.830 --> 24:59.030
Five, four, three, two, one.

25:00.550 --> 25:02.750
You answer it.
I'll get the tow truck.

25:08.630 --> 25:10.670
Barney's Service Station.

25:10.710 --> 25:15.430
Oh, hello there.
Of course I remember you.

25:15.510 --> 25:17.550
What seems to be the trouble?

25:47.550 --> 25:49.590
What is this,
a gag or something?

25:49.630 --> 25:51.110
A gag?

25:51.150 --> 25:52.910
You're sure you didn't
mess around with that motor?

25:52.950 --> 25:54.830
That's a terrible thing to say.

25:54.870 --> 25:56.950
Well, what's wrong with it?

25:56.990 --> 25:59.910
Look. If this is your attitude,
I'm not even gonna tell you.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.550
He's a factory-trained mechanic.

26:01.590 --> 26:03.510
That's like being a doctor.
You got to take an oath.

26:03.510 --> 26:05.390
All right, doc,
what's the word?

26:07.190 --> 26:08.590
You know anything about cars?

26:08.630 --> 26:12.590
Me? I need a copilot to turn on
the windshield wiper.

26:12.630 --> 26:13.590
The left intake valve
is cracked...

26:13.630 --> 26:15.670
on account of that
double camshaft...

26:15.710 --> 26:17.590
because of
the internal combustion.

26:17.630 --> 26:18.710
That bad?

26:18.750 --> 26:21.550
It happens once in a while.
You know these Italian cars.

26:21.590 --> 26:23.070
Well, don't stand there
talking to each other.

26:23.110 --> 26:25.350
Fix it!

26:25.390 --> 26:26.910
"Fix it," he says.

26:27.990 --> 26:29.870
I have to send to L.A.
For a new part...

26:29.910 --> 26:30.950
and if they don't have it,
it has to come...

26:30.990 --> 26:32.310
from the distributor
in New York...

26:32.350 --> 26:33.390
and if he doesn't have it...

26:33.430 --> 26:36.070
it has to come from
the factory in Milan.

26:36.110 --> 26:37.030
Milan?

26:37.070 --> 26:38.710
That's ridiculous.
He's a busy man.

26:38.750 --> 26:39.790
You bet I am.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.670
I got to get back and do
a television special.

26:41.710 --> 26:43.310
Oh, really? What channel?

26:43.350 --> 26:44.870
What the hell difference
does it make?

26:44.910 --> 26:45.950
I want to watch it.

26:45.990 --> 26:46.910
Well, we'll watch it together...

26:46.950 --> 26:48.310
because I'll probably
still be here.

26:48.350 --> 26:51.670
Quiet, will you? Let me think.

26:51.670 --> 26:53.110
What I could do
is take a valve...

26:53.110 --> 26:55.630
from that old Chevy
and grind it down to fit.

26:55.670 --> 26:57.110
That should get you
to Hollywood.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.190
He knows his business.

26:58.230 --> 26:59.310
And how long will that take?

26:59.350 --> 27:00.510
Well, if I work all night...

27:00.550 --> 27:02.550
I can have it for you
first thing in the morning.

27:02.590 --> 27:04.150
You mean I got to spend
the night in this dump?

27:04.190 --> 27:06.110
They just opened
a brand-new motel here.

27:06.150 --> 27:07.950
He wouldn't like it.
It stinks.

27:07.990 --> 27:08.950
How can you say that?

27:08.950 --> 27:10.870
It's got all the modern
conveniences.

27:10.910 --> 27:11.830
Didn't you hear what happened?

27:11.870 --> 27:12.790
A skunk got into
the air conditioning.

27:12.830 --> 27:13.870
I don't care where I sleep.

27:13.910 --> 27:15.750
Just find me
an empty pool table.

27:15.790 --> 27:17.190
I'm sure Mr. Spooner
would be glad...

27:17.230 --> 27:18.350
to put you up
for the night.

27:18.390 --> 27:19.550
Wouldn't you, Orville?

27:19.590 --> 27:21.990
Me? Oh, of course I would.

27:22.030 --> 27:23.270
He's got a spare room...

27:23.310 --> 27:25.270
and it's right
across the street.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.150
His wife... oh, his wife's a
great cook.

27:28.150 --> 27:29.270
I get the scene.

27:29.310 --> 27:30.510
This way.

27:30.550 --> 27:32.310
No, not you. You stay here...

27:32.350 --> 27:34.950
and start grinding
that little grabber.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.670
Come on. Let's go.

27:43.510 --> 27:45.470
Tell me, since we're both
in the same racket...

27:45.510 --> 27:46.710
Tin Pan Alley...

27:46.750 --> 27:49.750
don't you think that rock'n'roll
is on the way out?

27:49.790 --> 27:51.710
They're just not writing them
the way they used to...

27:51.750 --> 27:53.670
I mean those evergreens
like "Star Dust"

27:53.710 --> 27:54.990
and "Melancholy Baby."

27:55.030 --> 27:56.830
Look, let's cut out
all the small talk.

27:56.870 --> 27:57.950
I'm bushed.

27:59.750 --> 28:00.870
It's real quiet here.

28:00.910 --> 28:02.310
You can take a nice long nap...

28:02.350 --> 28:04.710
then we'll have some dinner,
and afterwards...

28:04.750 --> 28:07.110
we can sit around the piano
and sing some songs.

28:07.190 --> 28:08.590
Is that the only
action in this town?

28:08.630 --> 28:10.070
Oh, no. There's a bowling alley.

28:10.110 --> 28:12.110
Or you can stand outside
Pringle's hardware store...

28:12.150 --> 28:14.150
and watch color
television in the window.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.310
Hey, you're not
reading me right, pal.

28:15.350 --> 28:17.070
What's with the broads
around here?

28:17.110 --> 28:19.990
Broads? Oh, you mean
action action.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.430
Yeah. It's a habit
with me, like breathing.

28:22.470 --> 28:24.190
I should have known
from the gossip columns.

28:24.230 --> 28:25.550
Well, it's not that I like to.

28:25.590 --> 28:27.670
You see, I have to
because if I skip one night...

28:27.710 --> 28:29.670
I wake up the next morning
with such a headache.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.310
Oh.

28:31.350 --> 28:33.550
No, no.
This is our bedroom.

28:33.590 --> 28:35.150
You're in there.

28:41.950 --> 28:43.110
This is it...

28:43.150 --> 28:45.990
a sort of a combination
sewing room and guest room.

28:48.950 --> 28:50.550
You ought to have this tuned.

28:50.590 --> 28:51.710
Tuned?

28:52.510 --> 28:54.190
About your problem...
you know...

28:54.230 --> 28:55.590
that headache you
were talking about...

28:55.630 --> 28:58.150
maybe you ought
to try the Belly Button.

28:58.190 --> 28:59.110
The what?

28:59.190 --> 29:01.550
There's this roadhouse
just outside town...

29:01.590 --> 29:02.630
called the Belly Button.

29:02.670 --> 29:04.750
They've got these
cocktail waitresses.

29:04.790 --> 29:05.790
They're very friendly.

29:05.830 --> 29:07.750
At least, that's what I hear.
I've never been there myself.

29:07.790 --> 29:09.230
After all, I'm a married man.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.710
This your wife?

29:12.750 --> 29:14.110
Yes, sir. Her name is lambchop.

29:14.150 --> 29:16.710
It's really Zelda.
I call her lambchop.

29:16.750 --> 29:17.830
How about that?

29:17.870 --> 29:20.430
She sews and she knits
and she puts up preserves.

29:20.470 --> 29:23.190
And she grows her own parsley.

29:23.230 --> 29:24.550
Must be a great girl all around.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.630
Oh, she is.

29:26.670 --> 29:29.030
You lucky dog!

29:34.910 --> 29:36.590
Well, I guess
you're all set here.

29:36.630 --> 29:37.830
You know where everything is.

29:37.870 --> 29:40.350
It takes a few minutes
for the hot water to get hot.

29:40.390 --> 29:43.630
And if there's anything
else you want...

29:43.670 --> 29:44.990
bye now.

30:09.110 --> 30:10.070
Oh, hello, darling.

30:10.070 --> 30:11.310
Hello.

30:11.350 --> 30:12.550
Sorry I'm late.

30:12.590 --> 30:16.110
Dr. Sheldrake sends
you his regards.

30:16.150 --> 30:17.870
That's nice.

30:17.910 --> 30:18.870
How'd it go there?

30:18.870 --> 30:20.590
- Where?
- At the dentist.

30:20.630 --> 30:21.710
Oh, fine. Fine.

30:21.750 --> 30:22.710
Did he hurt you?

30:22.710 --> 30:25.470
No. But he thinks he'll have to
pull my wisdom tooth.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.110
You're lying, Zelda.

30:29.150 --> 30:30.430
Well, maybe he can save it.

30:30.470 --> 30:31.990
You weren't
at the dentist at all.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.910
Your appointment
isn't till next Tuesday.

30:33.950 --> 30:34.870
It's next Wednesday.

30:34.910 --> 30:36.310
So where were you today?

30:36.350 --> 30:38.270
If you must know,
I was at my mother's.

30:38.310 --> 30:39.270
On a Saturday?

30:39.350 --> 30:40.950
Isn't that when she works
at the blood bank?

30:40.990 --> 30:42.870
Orville, I'm not going to
answer any more questions.

30:42.910 --> 30:44.510
You haven't
answered any so far.

30:44.550 --> 30:46.350
I'm sick and tired
of you spying on me...

30:46.390 --> 30:47.350
and cross-examining me...

30:47.390 --> 30:48.950
and checking the mileage
on my car.

30:48.990 --> 30:50.590
Don't change the subject.

30:50.630 --> 30:51.710
I have myself vaccinated...

30:51.750 --> 30:53.270
and right away you want
to know who bit me.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.030
All right, who bit you?

30:55.070 --> 30:59.110
I mean, where were you?
And what's in that box?

31:00.070 --> 31:01.390
You really want me
to tell you?

31:01.430 --> 31:03.350
Yes.

31:03.390 --> 31:05.110
It's a present for my lover.

31:05.150 --> 31:07.790
Oh! Oh, it is, huh?

31:20.630 --> 31:22.150
It's today?

31:22.190 --> 31:23.790
September 30th.

31:23.830 --> 31:26.470
I thought it was the 31st.

31:26.510 --> 31:29.110
It was going to be a surprise,
and now you've spoiled it.

31:29.150 --> 31:31.910
I'm sorry, darling.
I guess I'm a monster.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.030
Yes, you are.

31:33.070 --> 31:34.470
I don't know why
you put up with me.

31:34.550 --> 31:35.470
I don't, either.

31:35.510 --> 31:37.430
Talk about mental cruelty.

31:37.470 --> 31:38.390
Jealousy.

31:38.430 --> 31:42.150
Suspicion, nagging,
and cross-examining.

31:42.190 --> 31:43.150
Do you want to know
why I'm late?

31:43.190 --> 31:44.630
You don't have to explain.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.270
Because of those
idiots at the bakery.

31:46.310 --> 31:49.110
I ordered pistachio cake,
and they made it chocolate.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.710
I know how you hate chocolate.

31:50.750 --> 31:53.110
Pistachio, chocolate...
who cares?

31:53.150 --> 31:55.110
I love you.

31:55.150 --> 31:56.630
Actually, I didn't mind waiting

31:56.670 --> 31:58.950
because otherwise I never
would have seen him.

31:58.990 --> 32:00.190
Who?

32:00.230 --> 32:01.590
I looked out the window...

32:01.630 --> 32:05.070
and there he was,
driving by in his car.

32:05.110 --> 32:06.630
Who?

32:06.670 --> 32:09.870
He wore sunglasses,
and he needed a shave...

32:09.910 --> 32:12.750
but I recognized him anyway.

32:12.790 --> 32:14.150
Who?

32:17.590 --> 32:18.910
Dino?

32:18.950 --> 32:20.390
I nearly fainted.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.750
I've been crazy about him
since I was 16.

32:22.790 --> 32:23.710
You never told me.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.870
I used to be president of
his fan club...

32:25.910 --> 32:27.430
and secretary-treasurer.

32:27.470 --> 32:28.510
There were just two
of us...

32:28.550 --> 32:30.390
me and Rosalie Schultz,
but she chickened out...

32:30.390 --> 32:31.470
and went over to Mitch Miller.

32:31.510 --> 32:33.310
I don't blame her.

32:33.350 --> 32:36.310
Imagine, Dino in person...
driving down Citrus Avenue.

32:36.350 --> 32:38.670
You must be imagining it.
It's ridiculous.

32:38.710 --> 32:41.150
What would a guy like that
be doing in Climax?

32:41.190 --> 32:42.950
Anyway, I read somewhere
that he's in Hollywood.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.270
Television or something.
What are you doing?

32:44.310 --> 32:45.270
I just want to play "Volare."

32:45.270 --> 32:46.230
Oh, no, you don't.

32:46.230 --> 32:47.230
Why not?

32:47.270 --> 32:49.110
You never know
who's going to barge in.

32:49.150 --> 32:50.230
Who?

32:50.270 --> 32:53.310
I don't know. Rosalie Schultz,
Mitch Miller, anybody.

32:53.350 --> 32:56.150
And besides, I don't want
a strange man singing to you.

32:56.190 --> 32:57.150
There you go again.

32:57.190 --> 33:01.430
I mean, after all,
it is our anniversary.

33:05.270 --> 33:06.830
I've got another
surprise for you.

33:06.870 --> 33:07.990
Another?

33:08.030 --> 33:09.230
You'll love it.

33:09.270 --> 33:11.430
I'd better go in the sewing
room and finish it.

33:11.470 --> 33:12.630
You do that.

33:18.190 --> 33:19.990
Sewing room!

33:20.030 --> 33:22.950
Zelda. Wait!

33:23.030 --> 33:24.230
What are you
going in there for?

33:24.270 --> 33:25.430
I have some sewing to do.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.790
What sewing?

33:26.830 --> 33:28.030
It's a secret.

33:28.070 --> 33:29.670
You know I don't like secrets.

33:29.710 --> 33:30.670
All right, if you insist.

33:30.710 --> 33:33.110
I'm making myself
a black chiffon negligee.

33:33.150 --> 33:34.550
I just have to put
the lace on the collar.

33:34.590 --> 33:36.550
I want it to be
ready for tonight.

33:36.630 --> 33:39.310
You don't need lace
on the collar.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.990
You don't even need
a negligee.

33:42.030 --> 33:44.390
And we don't have
to wait for tonight.

33:48.750 --> 33:49.990
I have no more
lessons today...

33:50.030 --> 33:52.150
and we're all alone
in the house...

33:52.190 --> 33:53.110
so why don't we...

33:53.150 --> 33:55.230
In the middle
of the afternoon?

33:55.270 --> 33:56.910
That's what makes it...

33:56.950 --> 33:58.670
the irregularity...

33:58.710 --> 34:00.670
that unexpected little twist.

34:00.710 --> 34:03.310
Orville, have you been
reading "Playboy" again?

34:03.350 --> 34:04.790
You just relax.

34:04.790 --> 34:07.670
I'll be with you
in a minute, lambchop.

34:50.270 --> 34:51.270
I was just coming to see you.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.310
Look what I got...

34:52.350 --> 34:53.989
all the Italian food
they had at the market.

34:54.030 --> 34:56.429
Macaroni, parmigiana,
frozen pizza, chianti.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.430
Forget it.

34:57.430 --> 34:58.430
That's what he likes.

34:58.470 --> 34:59.430
You'll gonna give him
an Italian dinner...

34:59.470 --> 35:00.750
play him our Italian song.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.990
Oh, no. He's gonna get into
his Italian car and beat it!

35:03.030 --> 35:03.950
What do you mean?

35:03.990 --> 35:05.990
I don't want him in the house.
We got to get rid of him.

35:06.030 --> 35:06.950
After all the trouble
we went to?

35:06.990 --> 35:08.870
- You heard me.
- Why?

35:08.950 --> 35:10.030
Because he's a sex maniac.

35:10.070 --> 35:11.190
So what? That's his problem.

35:11.230 --> 35:13.430
But it's my wife!
He's already after her.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.830
And what's worse, she's crazy
about him, too.

35:15.870 --> 35:19.230
Oh. What's wrong with that?
He likes her. She likes him.

35:19.270 --> 35:20.470
So while you're
plugging the songs...

35:20.510 --> 35:22.430
she's sort of
putting him in the mood.

35:22.470 --> 35:24.430
Why, you miserable...

35:24.470 --> 35:26.390
are you suggesting
that I use my wife?

35:26.390 --> 35:28.590
Watch that chianti.

35:28.630 --> 35:30.190
I don't care if
I never sell a song.

35:30.230 --> 35:32.630
I'd rather starve first
because I love my wife.

35:32.670 --> 35:34.030
I adore her. I worship her.

35:34.070 --> 35:35.030
Don't you trust her?

35:35.070 --> 35:37.830
No. Excuse me.

36:07.710 --> 36:09.470
Hurry up, playboy.

36:15.910 --> 36:18.110
It is no use arguing, Barney.

36:18.150 --> 36:20.910
Just reconnect
his fuel line and... pssst.

36:20.950 --> 36:22.870
Well, not so fast.

36:24.030 --> 36:25.990
Why do we have to
get rid of him?

36:26.030 --> 36:27.910
Why don't we get rid of her?

36:27.950 --> 36:28.870
Zelda?

36:28.910 --> 36:30.470
Sure. Just send her away
for the night...

36:30.510 --> 36:31.510
if you're so worried.

36:31.550 --> 36:32.990
Send her away.
That's already better...

36:33.030 --> 36:34.190
but it won't work.

36:34.230 --> 36:35.150
Why not?

36:35.190 --> 36:36.710
Didn't you hear what I said?

36:36.750 --> 36:38.990
This guy is only
interested in action.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.110
He's not going to spend
the night here...

36:40.150 --> 36:43.150
just with me, eating macaroni
and listening to our songs.

36:43.190 --> 36:44.510
He's going to be
at the Belly Button...

36:44.550 --> 36:46.790
Iooking for broads.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.430
Hold it. Hold it, hold it.

36:48.470 --> 36:50.110
Why does he have to go
to the Belly Button?

36:50.150 --> 36:52.270
Why don't we bring
the Belly Button to him?

36:52.310 --> 36:53.510
Now you're going too fast.

36:53.550 --> 36:54.590
Once Zelda's out of the way...

36:54.630 --> 36:56.510
we pick up one of those
cocktail waitresses...

36:56.550 --> 36:57.510
and get her over here.

36:57.550 --> 36:58.990
Mmm. That'll keep him
in the house.

36:59.030 --> 37:00.270
How am I going to
explain it to him?

37:00.310 --> 37:02.230
That I was afraid he was going
to make a pass at my wife...

37:02.270 --> 37:03.470
so we got him a chippy instead?

37:03.510 --> 37:05.590
You don't have to
explain anything.

37:05.630 --> 37:08.510
Just introduce her as your wife.

37:08.550 --> 37:10.190
What?

37:10.230 --> 37:11.310
Does he know
what Zelda looks like?

37:11.350 --> 37:12.750
- No, but...
- Then that's it.

37:12.790 --> 37:15.510
He's going to get
all the action he wants.

37:15.550 --> 37:17.590
Barney, you're sick!

37:17.630 --> 37:20.710
Uh-huh. He can
tickle her and pinch her...

37:20.750 --> 37:23.310
grab her, wrestle with her.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.310
Excuse me.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.190
Nice little lambchop.

38:08.230 --> 38:09.790
Coming, Orville.

38:11.630 --> 38:13.390
All right, all right.

38:13.430 --> 38:14.390
So it's a great idea.

38:14.430 --> 38:16.310
But just tell me one thing
if you're so clever...

38:16.350 --> 38:17.830
how do I get rid of my wife?

38:17.910 --> 38:20.350
That's the easiest part.
Hit her.

38:20.390 --> 38:21.430
Hit her?

38:21.470 --> 38:23.750
Or start an argument
or get her sore at you.

38:23.790 --> 38:26.990
Shove a grapefruit in her face.
There's lots of ways.

38:27.030 --> 38:28.670
You want me to
louse up my marriage?

38:28.710 --> 38:30.510
It's just for one night.

38:30.550 --> 38:32.430
So she cries a little.
She goes home to her mother.

38:32.470 --> 38:33.910
And tomorrow morning
you can explain...

38:33.910 --> 38:34.870
the whole thing to her.

38:34.910 --> 38:36.510
You buy her a nice present.

38:36.550 --> 38:37.750
By that time,
you can afford it...

38:37.790 --> 38:40.110
because we'll have
sold all those songs.

38:40.150 --> 38:43.150
You mean for no reason
at all... a grapefruit?

38:43.190 --> 38:44.830
Right in the kisser.

38:44.870 --> 38:45.830
Oh, I couldn't do that.

38:45.870 --> 38:47.190
You've got to
because you love her.

38:47.230 --> 38:49.230
It's for her own good.

38:49.270 --> 38:50.470
Orville!

38:51.790 --> 38:54.190
Good luck. And you better
get her out of here fast...

38:54.230 --> 38:55.470
because I'm on my way
to the Belly Button...

38:55.510 --> 38:57.270
to pick up that dame.

39:02.790 --> 39:04.110
Orville!

39:06.070 --> 39:09.790
Oh, Barney brought this...
a little anniversary present.

39:09.830 --> 39:10.830
Why did you get dressed again?

39:10.870 --> 39:11.950
Again?

39:11.990 --> 39:13.230
After you took a shower.

39:13.270 --> 39:15.590
I did? Oh, of course.

39:15.630 --> 39:18.870
And I got dressed again
because I was feeling chilly.

39:18.910 --> 39:20.870
You certainly didn't act chilly.

39:20.910 --> 39:21.830
When?

39:21.870 --> 39:23.390
When I was in the shower.

39:23.430 --> 39:25.790
I thought you were going to
climb right in with me.

39:25.830 --> 39:29.390
You did? I mean, did I?

39:29.430 --> 39:33.070
We could save a lot of money
on our water bill. Hmm?

39:33.110 --> 39:34.310
Hmm.

39:34.350 --> 39:35.750
Look what I dug up.

39:35.790 --> 39:36.710
What?

39:36.750 --> 39:38.150
Our wedding pictures.

39:38.190 --> 39:41.710
Oh? Just let me get
rid of this stuff.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.030
All right.

39:54.230 --> 39:55.750
Hey, you.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.630
Beethoven.

40:02.670 --> 40:05.230
When am I going to meet
that wife of yours?

40:05.270 --> 40:07.790
She's taking a nap because she
just took a shower...

40:07.830 --> 40:09.790
but I guess you know that.

40:09.830 --> 40:12.110
Did you say she grows
her own parsley?

40:12.150 --> 40:14.350
Yes. You'll have
some for dinner.

40:14.390 --> 40:16.070
That's when you'll
meet her... at dinner.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.350
I think I'll catch a little
shut-eye myself...

40:18.390 --> 40:20.390
so I can be nice and fresh.

40:20.430 --> 40:21.910
Fresh?

40:21.950 --> 40:25.630
I have a hunch this may turn
out to be a big night.

41:07.710 --> 41:10.870
Come here, darling.
You'll get a kick out of these.

41:10.910 --> 41:12.510
Out of what?

41:12.550 --> 41:14.710
Our wedding pictures.
Remember that day?

41:14.750 --> 41:18.430
Do I? It was
the worst day of my life.

41:18.470 --> 41:19.950
I thought it was beautiful.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.670
Oh, you did?

41:21.710 --> 41:22.630
It was just that
you tried to do...

41:22.670 --> 41:24.750
too many things
at the same time.

41:24.790 --> 41:25.870
Whoever heard
of a bridegroom...

41:25.910 --> 41:29.870
playing the organ
at his own wedding?

41:29.910 --> 41:32.070
Look at mother...
crying her eyes out.

41:32.110 --> 41:36.150
I'm glad you brought that up.

41:36.190 --> 41:39.030
You want to know how
I feel about your mother?

41:39.030 --> 41:39.990
No.

41:39.990 --> 41:43.150
All right, I'll tell you.
She makes me throw up.

41:43.190 --> 41:45.190
The way she treats your father.

41:45.230 --> 41:47.510
And you know
what she looks like?

41:47.550 --> 41:48.590
Godzilla!

41:48.630 --> 41:49.990
Now, now, Orville.

41:50.030 --> 41:51.510
Now, now, what?

41:51.550 --> 41:53.070
Mother may be a little
difficult, but...

41:53.110 --> 41:55.150
Difficult? She's impossible.

41:55.190 --> 41:59.390
A mean, vicious, loud-mouthed,
interfering old bag!

41:59.430 --> 42:01.830
Now, what do you think of that?

42:01.870 --> 42:04.710
Well, basically I have
to agree with you.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.030
You do?

42:06.070 --> 42:08.750
Why do you think I got married?
To get away from her.

42:08.790 --> 42:12.150
Oh, so that's the reason
why you married me.

42:12.190 --> 42:16.510
Not the only reason.
I also love you.

42:16.550 --> 42:18.590
Oh.

42:18.630 --> 42:21.910
Here are some pictures
from our honeymoon.

42:21.950 --> 42:23.830
Honeymoon?

42:23.870 --> 42:27.350
Boy, was that ever a flop.

42:27.390 --> 42:28.710
I wouldn't say that.

42:28.750 --> 42:31.310
Oh, you wouldn't?

42:31.350 --> 42:34.350
I'll admit the first night
was a little disappointing...

42:34.390 --> 42:35.430
when they didn't
have a room for us...

42:35.470 --> 42:37.230
and we had to sleep
out in your old rambler.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.470
It was a Volkswagen.

42:40.510 --> 42:41.710
Darling, here's a picture.

42:41.750 --> 42:43.190
It was a rambler,
a blue rambler.

42:43.230 --> 42:45.670
It was pink.

42:45.710 --> 42:46.630
Don't tell me.

42:46.670 --> 42:48.070
Of course it was blue...

42:48.150 --> 42:49.830
exactly the same color
as my eyes.

42:49.870 --> 42:53.430
Your eyes are pink.

42:53.470 --> 42:55.710
What are you talking about?
I have blue eyes.

42:55.750 --> 42:56.990
I say they're pink.

42:57.030 --> 42:59.750
You want to make
something of it?

42:59.790 --> 43:03.310
Orville, what is this...
some kind of a new game?

43:05.550 --> 43:07.150
I wonder who that could be.

43:11.990 --> 43:13.390
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spooner.

43:13.430 --> 43:14.350
May we come in?

43:14.390 --> 43:16.030
Of course, Reverend.

43:17.070 --> 43:17.990
Hello,
Mrs. Spooner.

43:18.070 --> 43:18.990
Mrs. Mulligan.

43:19.030 --> 43:19.950
- Hi, Zelda.
- Hi, Rosalie.

43:19.990 --> 43:22.030
We hate to intrude
on you like this...

43:22.070 --> 43:23.270
but we're collecting
signatures...

43:23.310 --> 43:25.310
for a petition
urging the city council...

43:25.350 --> 43:27.990
to close down
that dreadful place...

43:28.030 --> 43:30.030
if the ladies
will forgive my language...

43:30.070 --> 43:33.110
the Belly Button.

43:33.150 --> 43:36.870
Of course. We'll be glad
to sign, won't we, Orville?

43:36.910 --> 43:38.190
We will?

43:38.230 --> 43:42.070
Well, it's a disgrace,
a cesspool...

43:42.110 --> 43:43.470
a blot on our community.

43:43.510 --> 43:46.110
I understand they let minors
use the cigarette machine.

43:46.150 --> 43:48.310
Rosalie and I went
in there to investigate...

43:48.350 --> 43:49.950
and two strange men
approached us...

43:49.990 --> 43:51.750
and offered to
buy us Bloody Marys.

43:51.790 --> 43:53.470
I got the distinct impression

43:53.510 --> 43:55.790
that there's love for sale
on the premises.

43:55.830 --> 44:01.670
"Love For Sale," Cole Porter...
a million and a half copies.

44:01.710 --> 44:04.550
Well, what are we waiting for?
Who's got a fountain pen?

44:13.310 --> 44:15.630
Oh, I see you're celebrating
your anniversary.

44:15.670 --> 44:16.590
Our fifth.

44:16.630 --> 44:18.230
What a lovely cake.

44:18.270 --> 44:19.230
Pistachio?

44:19.270 --> 44:20.430
Would you like a piece?

44:20.470 --> 44:22.350
I wouldn't want you
to spoil it.

44:22.390 --> 44:24.550
Oh, well, maybe just
a little piece.

44:24.590 --> 44:26.470
In that case, I'll have
a little piece, too.

44:26.550 --> 44:27.470
Reverend?

44:27.510 --> 44:28.430
No, thank you.

44:28.470 --> 44:29.630
Cholesterol, you know.

44:29.670 --> 44:31.790
Thank you.

44:31.830 --> 44:34.990
However, if you happen to
have half a grapefruit.

44:37.470 --> 44:41.470
Well, actually, I was
saving it for my wife.

45:10.070 --> 45:11.750
What do you say, Barney?

45:14.070 --> 45:15.030
Is Polly working today?

45:15.070 --> 45:16.510
- Sure.
- Where?

45:16.550 --> 45:20.110
She's gone back to
being a blond again.

45:27.350 --> 45:29.110
Hey, Polly,
we were just wondering...

45:29.150 --> 45:31.790
how do you get that thing
to stay in there?

45:31.830 --> 45:33.030
I glue it in.

45:33.070 --> 45:34.710
Ha ha ha!

45:35.870 --> 45:38.390
What would happen
if I unglued it?

45:38.430 --> 45:40.270
You'd get beer in your eye.

45:40.310 --> 45:41.390
From there?

45:41.430 --> 45:44.030
From here.

45:55.510 --> 45:57.550
Look, Bertha, you still want
those new seat covers...

45:57.590 --> 45:58.950
in your station wagon?

45:58.990 --> 45:59.910
Why?

45:59.990 --> 46:02.030
I'll give them to you
for half price...

46:02.070 --> 46:03.430
if you'll do me a little favor.

46:03.470 --> 46:05.030
Like what?

46:07.750 --> 46:10.630
It's OK with me
if it's OK with Polly.

46:10.710 --> 46:11.950
Muah!

46:18.030 --> 46:21.350
Listen, Polly, I got
a proposition for you.

46:21.390 --> 46:23.430
Step back.
Here comes a big one.

46:24.550 --> 46:25.470
Gesundheit.

46:25.510 --> 46:27.150
Like I said,
I got a proposition.

46:27.190 --> 46:28.110
I need you.

46:28.150 --> 46:29.110
Right now?

46:29.150 --> 46:30.070
It's an emergency.

46:30.110 --> 46:31.630
Yeah, it must be.

46:31.670 --> 46:34.030
Actually, it's not for me.
It's for a friend of mine.

46:34.070 --> 46:35.790
He's giving a little party.
It's an all-night job.

46:35.830 --> 46:37.310
I just got on duty.

46:37.350 --> 46:39.230
I won't be through
till 1:00 in the morning.

46:39.270 --> 46:41.350
It's OK. I talked to Big Bertha.

46:41.390 --> 46:42.510
It's all fixed.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.270
You better get yourself
another girl.

46:44.310 --> 46:46.870
I'm coming down with this cold,
and I feel lousy.

46:46.910 --> 46:48.990
Well, if you want to
pass up 25 bucks.

46:49.030 --> 46:51.390
- How much?
- 25 bucks.

46:51.430 --> 46:53.350
Huh?

46:53.390 --> 46:54.550
Suddenly I feel better.

46:55.550 --> 46:57.110
Atta girl. Let's go.

46:57.150 --> 46:58.430
Don't you want me to
change my clothes first?

46:58.470 --> 46:59.750
Come on.
I got my motor running.

46:59.790 --> 47:00.990
At least let me
put on a coat.

47:01.030 --> 47:01.950
What for?

47:01.990 --> 47:03.830
Do you want me
to catch pneumonia?

47:03.870 --> 47:05.230
On an outside job like this...

47:05.270 --> 47:06.830
I'm not covered
by any Blue Cross.

47:06.870 --> 47:07.910
Ok, but step on it.

47:07.950 --> 47:08.910
I'll pick you up
around the back.

47:08.950 --> 47:09.950
Yeah.

47:21.590 --> 47:24.270
Bang! Bang! Bang!

47:54.030 --> 47:55.030
Here's your dinner, Sam.

47:55.990 --> 47:58.270
I won't be home till late.

47:58.310 --> 47:59.470
Polly!

47:59.510 --> 48:02.030
I'm coming!

48:02.070 --> 48:04.190
Now, don't stay up
all night watching TV.

48:04.230 --> 48:05.310
It's not good for your eyes.

48:09.830 --> 48:11.190
Are you kidding?

48:11.230 --> 48:13.190
I'm not going in any truck.

48:13.230 --> 48:17.310
Listen to her... Princess Grace.
Get your keister in here!

48:17.350 --> 48:20.230
You know what you are?
No gentleman.

48:20.310 --> 48:22.310
Come on! Come on!

48:22.350 --> 48:23.710
OK.

48:40.910 --> 48:43.030
Say, what kind of party
is this anyway?

48:43.070 --> 48:44.990
My friend will explain
the whole thing to you.

48:45.030 --> 48:46.670
What are you so worried about?

48:46.710 --> 48:49.710
Well, the last time I took
a job like this was July 4th.

48:49.750 --> 48:51.270
It was one of those
bachelor barbecues...

48:51.310 --> 48:54.830
with fireworks and everything,
and they raffled me off.

48:54.870 --> 48:56.390
I went for $83.

48:57.550 --> 48:59.350
Except the next day,
the check bounced...

48:59.390 --> 49:02.590
so all I got out of it
was a case of poison ivy.

49:07.830 --> 49:10.110
Thank you, Mrs. Spooner.

49:10.150 --> 49:11.070
Bye, Rosalie.

49:11.110 --> 49:12.190
Happy anniversary, Zelda.

49:12.230 --> 49:13.870
Come, come, ladies.
We have a lot of work to do.

49:13.910 --> 49:16.150
We need another 400 signatures.

49:18.870 --> 49:20.070
Reverend.

49:22.310 --> 49:23.670
Are you sure you
don't need some help?

49:23.710 --> 49:25.550
After all, 400 signatures.

49:25.590 --> 49:27.030
Why don't you take
my wife along?

49:27.070 --> 49:28.430
She's very good
at this sort of thing.

49:28.470 --> 49:29.510
Oh, I wouldn't think of it.

49:29.550 --> 49:31.230
Not on your anniversary.

49:33.550 --> 49:35.110
This way, playboy.

49:45.510 --> 49:48.710
In case there are
any more petitions.

49:48.750 --> 49:49.790
Yeah.

49:53.710 --> 49:54.870
Now...

49:54.910 --> 49:56.470
Where were we?

49:58.150 --> 50:01.310
You know, this town isn't
going to be the same...

50:01.350 --> 50:04.430
if they close down
the Belly Button.

50:04.470 --> 50:05.430
Why should you care?

50:05.470 --> 50:06.750
Why should I care?

50:06.790 --> 50:08.670
I happen to be their
biggest customer.

50:08.710 --> 50:09.630
You?

50:09.670 --> 50:11.110
All those nights
when you thought...

50:11.150 --> 50:13.030
I was at choir practice
or bowling...

50:13.110 --> 50:15.270
or watching color television
outside Pringle's...

50:15.310 --> 50:16.950
I was really
at the Belly Button.

50:16.990 --> 50:18.230
Doing what?

50:18.270 --> 50:20.950
Using that cigarette machine,
drinking Mary Bloodies...

50:20.990 --> 50:23.070
and a lot of other things, but
I'd rather not talk about it...

50:23.110 --> 50:25.710
because you'll just get sore
and walk out on me.

50:25.750 --> 50:26.990
What other things?

50:27.030 --> 50:28.270
You may think I'm
sort of a square...

50:28.310 --> 50:30.990
but ask any of those
cocktail waitresses there...

50:31.030 --> 50:33.950
I am a swinger.

50:33.990 --> 50:35.190
Sure you are.

50:35.230 --> 50:37.550
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

50:51.070 --> 50:54.310
Poor Zelda. I guess the wife
is always the last to know.

50:54.350 --> 50:55.270
Know what?

50:55.350 --> 50:57.950
For your information, I have
been playing around for years.

50:57.990 --> 50:58.950
Oh?

50:59.030 --> 51:00.110
And not just with those
waitresses...

51:00.150 --> 51:01.510
with some of your best friends.

51:01.550 --> 51:02.470
Like who?

51:02.550 --> 51:04.430
Well, I'm too much of
a gentleman to mention names...

51:04.470 --> 51:05.590
but last Thanksgiving...

51:05.630 --> 51:07.790
there was a little incident
in the organ loft.

51:07.830 --> 51:10.030
Oh, you and Rosalie Schultz.

51:10.070 --> 51:11.030
How did you know?

51:11.070 --> 51:13.390
She told me all about it.
We had a big laugh.

51:13.430 --> 51:14.390
You mean, you were discussing...

51:14.430 --> 51:15.790
my sex life
with another woman...

51:15.830 --> 51:17.030
and laughing about it?

51:17.070 --> 51:18.190
What sex life?

51:18.230 --> 51:19.630
So you chased her
up the bell tower.

51:19.670 --> 51:21.750
It just so happens
that she chased me.

51:21.790 --> 51:24.430
What difference does it make?
Nobody caught anybody.

51:24.470 --> 51:26.030
And anyway, I trust you.

51:26.070 --> 51:27.950
You trust me?

51:27.990 --> 51:30.230
That's a lousy thing to say
about your husband.

51:30.270 --> 51:32.630
Don't you think I'm attractive
to other women?

51:32.670 --> 51:34.910
You're attractive to me.

51:35.910 --> 51:37.510
So come to bed.

51:40.270 --> 51:41.430
Oh, no.

51:41.470 --> 51:42.870
You're not going
to weasel out of it.

51:42.910 --> 51:45.230
The truth is, you don't
give a damn about me...

51:45.270 --> 51:47.590
because if you did,
you'd be jealous.

51:47.630 --> 51:49.030
You'd fight for me.

51:49.070 --> 51:50.830
It's the most primitive
emotion there is.

51:50.870 --> 51:52.110
You take the Watusis.

51:52.150 --> 51:54.270
I read all about it
in the "National Geographic"...

51:54.310 --> 51:55.950
in Dr. Sheldrake's office.

51:55.990 --> 51:57.670
If a Watusi wife
catches another woman...

51:57.710 --> 51:59.630
with a Watusi husband, you
know what she does?

51:59.670 --> 52:02.190
She buries her in sand up to
her neck...

52:02.230 --> 52:04.230
and smears honey
all over her head...

52:04.270 --> 52:06.230
and lets the red ants
loose on her.

52:06.270 --> 52:08.230
But what do you do
when Rosalie Schultz...

52:08.270 --> 52:09.870
tries to steal your husband?

52:09.910 --> 52:12.070
You give her a piece
of pistachio cake!

52:12.110 --> 52:14.190
Well, if that's
all you care about me...

52:14.230 --> 52:15.230
I've had it.

52:15.270 --> 52:17.390
I'm not staying here
another minute.

52:17.430 --> 52:19.630
Where do you think you're going?

52:19.670 --> 52:21.550
I'm going home to mother.

52:24.150 --> 52:27.950
Orville! Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

52:27.990 --> 52:29.590
That's right. What am I doing?

52:29.630 --> 52:30.790
It's the other way around.

52:30.830 --> 52:32.790
You're going home
to your mother.

52:32.830 --> 52:35.150
Darling, what's
the matter with you?

52:35.190 --> 52:36.990
All day you've been
trying to pick a fight.

52:37.030 --> 52:38.190
It's for your own good.

52:38.230 --> 52:40.150
There isn't room enough
here for the three of us.

52:40.190 --> 52:41.470
The three of us?

52:41.510 --> 52:44.550
I mean the four of us.
Out you go.

52:44.590 --> 52:46.990
Orville, you're not
making any sense.

52:47.030 --> 52:49.670
This is me, your wife.
Zelda, remember?

52:49.710 --> 52:50.910
Five years ago today...

52:50.950 --> 52:53.710
we promised to love, honor,
and cherish each other...

52:53.750 --> 52:54.910
and you were so nervous...

52:54.950 --> 52:57.270
you put the ring
on the minister's finger.

52:57.310 --> 53:01.390
Oh, cut out that sentimental
slush!

53:01.430 --> 53:02.790
Out!

53:02.830 --> 53:03.790
Oh...

53:06.590 --> 53:08.710
Don't cry, lambchop. Please.

53:08.750 --> 53:10.310
Maybe I'm not
making any sense now...

53:10.350 --> 53:11.590
but I'll make a lot
of sense tomorrow...

53:11.630 --> 53:13.030
when I explain
the whole thing.

53:13.070 --> 53:13.990
Don't bother!

53:14.070 --> 53:15.830
Tomorrow or any other time!

53:23.710 --> 53:25.430
Zelda!

53:43.030 --> 53:46.630
Nice timing, Orville.
Now we're cooking.

53:46.670 --> 53:50.950
I wish I were in hell
with my back broken.

53:50.990 --> 53:53.630
Just wait till you see
what I brought for dessert.

53:54.950 --> 53:56.750
This is Polly.

53:59.510 --> 54:00.430
My friend Orville.

54:00.470 --> 54:01.710
Hi.

54:01.750 --> 54:03.270
Not here.

54:03.350 --> 54:04.830
You want the whole
neighborhood to know?

54:04.870 --> 54:06.670
Get her in the house.

54:06.710 --> 54:07.830
That's some welcome.

54:07.870 --> 54:10.310
Stop beefing.
This is cash on the line...

54:10.390 --> 54:11.950
and no poison ivy.

54:11.990 --> 54:13.510
Come on. Come on.

54:21.910 --> 54:24.590
You got a wastepaper basket
someplace?

54:26.750 --> 54:28.110
Well, what do you think of her?

54:28.150 --> 54:29.990
I guess she's all right,
but I wouldn't know.

54:30.030 --> 54:33.710
You can take my word for it.
She's a pistol, a real pistol.

54:33.750 --> 54:34.790
Say, what is this?

54:34.830 --> 54:36.470
You brought me all
the way here on approval?

54:36.510 --> 54:38.830
No, no. You got a deal. Right?

54:38.870 --> 54:40.110
Oh, sure. We've gone this far.

54:40.150 --> 54:41.550
We may as well
go through with it.

54:41.590 --> 54:43.230
Don't force yourself, mister.

54:43.270 --> 54:44.670
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

54:44.710 --> 54:45.710
I think you're
most attractive...

54:45.750 --> 54:47.430
and you're going to do
a very good job.

54:47.470 --> 54:49.510
What does he want now,
references?

54:49.550 --> 54:51.550
Simmer down. You, too...

54:51.590 --> 54:53.270
because it's gonna work out
just great.

54:53.310 --> 54:54.670
I hope so.

54:54.710 --> 54:56.550
Don't bet on it, hon.

54:56.590 --> 54:57.670
I better leave you alone now.

54:57.710 --> 54:58.670
Do you have to?

54:58.710 --> 55:00.150
I'm supposed to be
grinding that valve.

55:01.710 --> 55:02.790
And one more thing...

55:02.830 --> 55:05.070
you got all night,
so take it easy.

55:05.070 --> 55:07.070
You don't have to start
on the piano right away.

55:07.110 --> 55:10.870
Build up to it slowly.

55:10.910 --> 55:12.550
Know what I mean?

55:12.590 --> 55:13.870
Maybe while you have dinner...

55:13.910 --> 55:15.630
you can sneak it
into the conversation.

55:15.630 --> 55:18.430
And then after dinner,
you can really go all out.

55:24.750 --> 55:26.630
Well, shall we get organized?

55:26.670 --> 55:29.990
Look, I'm a good sport...
I mean, you could ask anybody...

55:30.030 --> 55:32.270
but none of that
crazy stuff, huh?

55:32.310 --> 55:34.030
You see, I got this bad cold.

55:34.030 --> 55:37.150
Did you ever hear of anybody
with a... with a good cold?

55:37.190 --> 55:38.350
Huh.

55:40.110 --> 55:41.990
It's a nice place you got here.

55:42.030 --> 55:43.430
Oh, you'll like it.

55:43.470 --> 55:45.830
It's not very big,
but it's clean.

55:45.870 --> 55:47.270
What is?

55:47.310 --> 55:48.710
What is what?

55:48.750 --> 55:51.230
I don't know.
You brought it up.

55:52.630 --> 55:54.670
First thing you have to do
is get out of those clothes.

55:54.710 --> 55:56.870
Just like that?

55:56.910 --> 55:57.830
You're so right.

55:57.870 --> 56:00.590
First thing, we'd better make
sure my wife isn't coming back.

56:00.630 --> 56:02.350
Yeah. I think we better.

56:10.870 --> 56:12.910
You realize if it weren't
for venetian blinds...

56:12.950 --> 56:14.390
it would be curtains
for all of us?

56:14.430 --> 56:16.270
I guess you can't
be too careful...

56:16.310 --> 56:17.830
a man in your position.

56:17.870 --> 56:19.150
My position?

56:19.190 --> 56:20.590
Oh, I recognized you
right away.

56:20.590 --> 56:23.150
I see you at church
every Sunday playing the organ.

56:24.190 --> 56:25.590
You go to church?

56:25.630 --> 56:26.750
All of us girls go.

56:26.790 --> 56:28.950
Big Bertha takes us
in the station wagon.

56:28.990 --> 56:30.590
Well, you know what they say...

56:30.630 --> 56:32.550
the family that
stays together...

56:32.590 --> 56:36.190
It's just that Bertha thinks
it's good for public relations.

56:38.150 --> 56:39.550
We mustn't wake him up,
not yet...

56:39.590 --> 56:40.950
because if he catches on,
we'll be dead.

56:40.990 --> 56:41.910
Who?

56:41.950 --> 56:42.870
Barney and me.

56:42.910 --> 56:44.390
No, I mean, who's gonna
catch on?

56:44.430 --> 56:45.670
Nobody, I hope.

56:45.710 --> 56:47.510
So, shall we...

56:47.550 --> 56:48.790
Oh, OK.

56:48.830 --> 56:49.750
No, no.

56:49.790 --> 56:53.390
Not in here. In the bedroom.

56:53.390 --> 56:54.670
You name it.

56:59.230 --> 57:01.350
Don't mind me
if I'm a little nervous...

57:01.390 --> 57:02.870
but so much depends on this.

57:02.910 --> 57:03.990
I just hope we can swing it.

57:04.030 --> 57:05.070
We'll do our best.

57:05.110 --> 57:06.310
Thank you.

57:07.950 --> 57:10.910
Now if you'll just put on
one of my wife's dresses.

57:11.950 --> 57:13.030
What for?

57:13.070 --> 57:14.630
That's the only way it'll work.

57:14.670 --> 57:16.750
We've got to pretend
you're my wife.

57:18.830 --> 57:21.550
What are you,
some kind of a weirdie?

57:21.550 --> 57:22.790
Didn't Barney tell you?

57:22.830 --> 57:25.190
He didn't tell me to expect
anything like this.

57:26.150 --> 57:27.750
I'm getting out of here.

57:27.790 --> 57:28.870
Now just a second.

57:28.910 --> 57:31.150
You know, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

57:31.190 --> 57:32.710
All those people
in the congregation...

57:32.750 --> 57:35.350
do they know what you're doing
the other six days of the week?

57:35.390 --> 57:36.390
You don't understand.

57:36.430 --> 57:39.230
It's not for me. It's for him.

57:39.270 --> 57:40.310
Who's him?

57:40.350 --> 57:42.790
Back there. He's asleep.

57:42.830 --> 57:45.830
What are we playing,
musical chairs?

57:45.870 --> 57:48.110
Barney says it's not for him,
it's for a friend of his.

57:48.110 --> 57:50.790
Now you say it's not for you,
it's for a friend of yours.

57:50.830 --> 57:52.190
Oh, but he's not
exactly a friend.

57:52.230 --> 57:53.630
It's more like
a business promotion...

57:53.670 --> 57:55.350
and he likes action
all the time.

57:55.390 --> 57:58.230
I got nothing against that,
but not with Zelda.

57:58.270 --> 57:59.830
Oh. Who's Zelda?

57:59.870 --> 58:01.030
You are.

58:01.070 --> 58:02.310
Me?

58:02.350 --> 58:04.590
It's my wife,
but tonight you're her...

58:04.590 --> 58:06.830
so you're Zelda.

58:06.830 --> 58:09.230
What did I get myself into?

58:09.230 --> 58:11.310
Oh, you just wait till you
find out who he is.

58:11.350 --> 58:12.270
You'll flip.

58:12.310 --> 58:13.470
Huh. I will?

58:13.510 --> 58:14.750
Oh, boy.

58:14.790 --> 58:16.710
So who can it be...
Richard Burton?

58:16.750 --> 58:20.750
No, but you're getting warm.
Here, try this.

58:20.790 --> 58:23.830
It may be a little tight,
but that can't hurt any.

58:33.190 --> 58:34.910
Oops.

58:36.350 --> 58:37.750
What's the matter now?

58:37.790 --> 58:39.150
I lost my navel.

58:39.190 --> 58:40.830
Where?

58:40.870 --> 58:42.990
I think it rolled under there.

59:10.830 --> 59:12.070
Where am I?

59:12.110 --> 59:13.190
In Climax.

59:13.230 --> 59:14.310
Where?

59:14.350 --> 59:15.310
Don't you remember?

59:15.310 --> 59:17.030
You had that cracked valve?

59:17.070 --> 59:18.550
Beethoven?

59:18.590 --> 59:19.790
Oh.

59:19.790 --> 59:21.030
What time is it?

59:21.070 --> 59:24.230
Oh, it's only 4:00, so why don't
you go back to sleep?

59:29.070 --> 59:31.230
What are you doing down
there, anyway?

59:31.270 --> 59:33.470
I'm looking for
my wife's navel.

59:33.510 --> 59:34.670
Oh.

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:26.390
Looks real nice, Polly.

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.790
Thanks, and the name
is Zelda.

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:30.230
Oh, yes, of course.

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:32.150
Hey, candles.

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:34.550
I found them in the drawer.

01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:37.710
For intimate dining,
candlelight is a romantic must.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:38.710
Oh?

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:39.830
I used to read up
on all that stuff...

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.350
in Ladies' Home Journal...

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.550
what every bride should know,
how to keep your husband happy.

01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:46.950
Say, maybe we should have
some place cards.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.910
I don't think so.

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:49.630
There's just the three of us.

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:53.550
Tell me, how did
you and I meet?

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:54.910
What do you mean?
Barney brought you.

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.350
Oh, no. You and Zelda.

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.350
I'm Zelda, remember?

01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:58.990
How did we meet,
in case it comes up?

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.750
Oh. Well, you were
singing in the choir...

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:03.870
and I noticed you right away
because you were always off-key.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.750
Hmm. So you kept me after hours.

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.630
I wanted to, but your mother
used to watch us like a hawk.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:08.590
She never liked me much.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:09.550
So?

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.310
So in order to
ingratiate myself...

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:12.790
you see, she works
at the blood bank...

01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:16.150
I'd go in three times a week
and give a pint of blood.

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:17.510
Three pints a week?

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:18.710
Well, the other days,
I'd sneak over...

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.750
to the hospital in Silver City
and get a transfusion.

01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:25.630
Boy, you must have
been nuts about me.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:27.030
I certainly was.

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:31.390
And, uh, how did
you propose to me?

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:34.030
Well, I wrote this love song...

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.430
and one afternoon while
I was tuning your piano...

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:39.750
I played it to you,
and that did it.

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:42.710
Imagine...

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:45.230
somebody writing
a whole song for you.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.150
You know, when I was
in high school...

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:51.630
there was this boy.

01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:53.670
He used to write me poems.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.990
What kind of poems?

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:58.430
In chalk, on sidewalks
and fences.

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:00.910
Why, I had to go
all over town erasing them.

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:03.830
Polly... I mean, Zelda...

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:05.750
keep an eye
on the meat sauce, will you?

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:06.790
Sure.

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:08.870
I hate to put you
to work like this...

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:09.870
I mean, like a housewife.

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:10.950
Oh, I enjoy it.

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:12.390
As a matter of fact...

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.990
I was almost a wife once myself.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.110
Almost?

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:17.670
That's how I happened
to wind up in nevada.

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.070
Where are you from?

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.190
Jersey City, New Jersey.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.870
I was working at the Plaza Hotel
as a manicurist...

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.750
and I had this 1,200 bucks
my father left me.

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:29.310
So I was going to open
a little beauty shop... my own.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:31.430
Then I met this guy.

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:34.270
This needs more salt.

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:35.230
What guy?

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:40.030
He was a salesman,
a hula hoop salesman.

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:41.430
Remember those things?

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:47.990
He wanted to marry me.

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:51.710
That figures.

01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:55.550
So I bought this
secondhand car and trailer.

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.070
We drove to Nevada,
spent the night here.

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:02.150
The next day, we were supposed
to go to Vegas and get hitched.

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:04.670
Could use some pepper, too.

01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.190
What happened?

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.950
When I woke up
in the morning...

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.310
the guy was gone,
and the car was gone.

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:12.150
That was it.

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.430
You know anybody who can use
six dozen plastic hula hoops?

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.270
They come in assorted colors.

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.830
You mean he just took off?

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.190
Eh, I should have known
he was a fink.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.950
He had small moons.

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:25.550
He had what?

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:29.390
You know, small moons
on the fingernails.

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:33.830
Now, you, for instance,
you got big moons.

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:34.990
Is that good?

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.750
It means you're a gentleman.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:38.030
When you're a manicurist,

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:38.990
you can tell a lot
about people...

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.470
just from their hands.

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:42.190
I never had a manicure
in my life.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:43.790
Nobody in this town has.

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.830
That's why I had to take a job
at the Belly Button...

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:48.430
trying to scrape up
enough money to get another car.

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.190
But something always
seems to happen.

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:51.910
I guess I'm stuck here for good.

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:55.150
A girl like you... I'm sure
you'll find some nice guy.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:57.870
Not a chance, unless I get
out of this place.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:01.950
Around here, I'm just somebody
the bartender recommends.

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:03.430
"Try Polly the Pistol."

01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:05.950
'S marvelous

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:07.390
You should care

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.070
'S paradise

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:25.870
'S awful nice, woo, pow

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:26.870
Paradise

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:29.070
Let's get ready.

01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:30.350
He'll be out in a minute.

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:31.910
I know that voice
from someplace.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:33.590
Of course you do. He's a singer.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:34.550
Who?

01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:36.030
Now don't flip.

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.030
Well, who is it?

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:38.630
It's Dino.

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.590
Dino?

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:40.550
That's right.

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:41.510
Hmm.

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:42.590
I like Andy Williams better.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.670
Shh! For heaven's sake,
watch it.

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:45.630
You're supposed
to be nice to him.

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.590
Don't worry. I know my job.

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.590
Now let me look at you.

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.630
Maybe we'd better open
a couple of buttons.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:53.950
Your wife wouldn't do that.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.910
I guess not.

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:58.150
Oh, the ring.
You should have a ring.

01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:59.590
Here, put this on.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:03.150
You suppose there's
a law against this?

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:04.590
Against what?

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.510
Wearing a ring
without a license.

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:07.590
Don't be silly.

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.390
Come on, let's go
into the living room.

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:14.190
Domestic, domestic.

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.030
We've got to
make it look domestic.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:19.230
You sit here, and I'll sit here.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.150
No, that's not domestic enough.

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.150
You knit, and I'll read.

01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:30.430
Uh... uh, I don't
know how to knit.

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:34.190
Well, then you read,
and I'll knit.

01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.270
No, that's no good.

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.110
Now, let me see...

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:44.870
'S wonderful

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:47.670
'S marvelous

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.590
You should care for me

01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:54.630
Mmm, 's awful nice

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:56.510
Paradise

01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:59.990
Hard to see

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:19.390
Pardon me.

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:21.030
Is this the way to Disneyland?

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:25.070
Oh, we didn't hear you.

01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:28.310
This is my wife Zelda.

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:29.590
Howdy, ma'am.

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:31.630
My husband told me
you were staying with us.

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.190
What a delightful surprise.

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:34.190
Zelda has all your records.

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:35.830
She's a big fan of yours.

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:36.990
I'm a big fan of hers.

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:38.510
I picked these on the way here.

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:40.830
Oh, they're lovely.

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:42.510
Cocktail time.
What would you like?

01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:45.110
Martini? Old fashioned?
Vodka on the rocks?

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:46.070
No, thanks.

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:47.110
Nothing to drink?

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:49.070
Just a bowl of bourbon
and some crackers.

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.910
Bourbon. Good idea.

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:52.230
How about you, Zelda?

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:54.390
Uh, do we have any buttermilk
in the house?

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:56.110
Buttermilk! Coming right up.

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:02.110
Well, just don't...

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.190
stand there, you two. Talk.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:06.750
Mingle.

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:09.710
Uh, tell me something.

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:11.550
Anything.

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.310
How'd you happen
to get stranded here?

01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:14.830
Oh, just lucky, I guess.

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:18.950
Oops.

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:21.150
You know, that dress dummy
don't do you justice...

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:22.750
even with all the padding.

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:24.790
I suppose I've put on
a few pounds.

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:26.150
Well, don't you worry about it.

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:27.110
As far as I'm concerned...

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:29.750
there couldn't
be enough of you...

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:31.190
baby.

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:32.190
Huh.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:34.630
How much do you
think she weighs?

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:43.070
Guess.

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:48.150
May I?

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.230
Help yourself.

01:07:58.350 --> 01:07:59.430
115.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:01.270
Guess again.

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.390
Glad to.

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.710
120?

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:11.430
You're getting warm.

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:12.990
Oh, boy.

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:16.870
Oh, that's close enough.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:22.630
How much you think I weigh?

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:27.750
Go ahead, lambchop.

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:28.990
Take a crack at it.

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:30.350
Yeah.

01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:32.390
1731/2.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:34.270
That's not fair.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.109
Right on the nose.

01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:37.069
Skol.

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:38.029
What?

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:38.990
Skol!

01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:40.350
Sure, it's cold.
It's got ice in it.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.870
Funny! Funny!

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.910
Well, drink up
and be somebody.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:52.350
Why don't we sit down?

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.310
Why don't we?

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:57.470
Ah, lambchop, Dino,
and I'll sit back here.

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:59.149
Where'd you get
this crazy couch?

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:00.910
Oh, it's been
in the family for years.

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:02.590
It's a love seat.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:05.390
Love seat? For three?

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.910
Victorian, you know.

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:09.630
Two lovers and a chaperone,
but that didn't stop anyone.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:12.590
It was usually an old lady,
half-deaf, half-blind...

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:15.149
sitting there and... knitting.

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:17.550
Knitting?

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:18.710
It's good therapy.

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.109
I took it up
when I quit smoking.

01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:21.069
It keeps my hands busy.

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:22.029
You know what they say...

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:24.990
the devil finds work
for idle hands.

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.470
What are you knitting?

01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:47.910
A sock.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.470
With a turtleneck?

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.030
He's got small moons.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.030
Oh?

01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.990
I got what?

01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:00.430
Oh, it's this theory
my wife has.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.230
If you've got small moons
on your nails...

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:04.110
you're a gentleman
and a scholar.

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.070
Interesting.

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:06.750
Now, you take me.
I've got big moons.

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:09.870
That means I'm a fink.

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:13.270
Well, you're only half right
about me.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.510
I'm no scholar.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.390
Knit one, purl two.

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:20.430
Hmm. Something around here
smells good.

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:21.750
It's the meat sauce.

01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:22.950
It's making my mouth water.

01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:24.310
We also got you some pizza.

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:26.670
How about a little antipasto?

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:33.190
You'll spoil your appetite.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.310
You want to bet?

01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:39.310
Damn!

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:40.590
What's the matter?

01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:41.790
I've dropped a stitch.

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:43.150
Oh.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:48.150
You know, you can lose
a hand that way.

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:55.150
Did you hear the story
about the girl and the lobster?

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:56.470
No. How does it go?

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:58.390
Well, this girl was sitting
in a movie house...

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.430
and this guy sat down
next to her...

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:01.910
and they were
sitting in the dark...

01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.630
and they were watching the
picture, see...

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.910
and suddenly
she felt something...

01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:07.630
crawling up her leg
and pinched her.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.590
Ah!

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:09.670
Go on.

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:10.910
Then she felt something
crawling again...

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:12.070
and pinched her again.

01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:14.670
She said, "What is the idea
of you pinching me?"

01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:18.310
And he said,
"Well, it wasn't me.

01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:19.350
It was my lobster."

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:21.390
His lobster?

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:22.990
He explained it. He said...

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:24.790
"A friend of mine
gave me a live lobster"...

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:25.950
and I said,
"Gee, that's wonderful.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.110
"I think I'll take it
home for dinner."

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:29.270
He said, "No,
it already had dinner.

01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:30.910
"Why don't you take it
to a movie?"

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:37.110
Take it to a movie!

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:38.630
...to a movie.

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:41.030
I told you. He's a funny man.

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:42.390
Yeah. Funny.

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:46.910
You got any more
stories like that?

01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:48.070
Yeah. I got...

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:50.270
Oh, yeah. There was the one
about this doctor, you see.

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.870
He was examining
a girl's knee, and he said...

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:56.190
"What's a joint like this doing
on a pretty girl like you?"

01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:00.910
Oh! Oh, I got to remember
that one.

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:05.550
Excuse me. I've got
something on the stove.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.830
I think this belongs to you.

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:13.870
Me. You. What's the difference?

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:14.830
Maybe I'd better help you.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:15.790
No, no, no, no.

01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:17.710
You stay right
where you are, lambchop.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:18.670
Make him feel at home.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.230
Show him a little
western hospitality.

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:25.390
We don't want him to have
a headache tomorrow.

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:34.230
What is this, Candid Camera?

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:38.150
You must think my husband
is sort of, uh, peculiar.

01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:39.670
Oh, no.
As a matter of fact...

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:41.550
I'm getting very fond of him.

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:42.710
So am I.

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.670
And I'm crazy about his wife.

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.510
Do you know what
I'd like right now?

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:50.470
Sure. Another bowl
of bourbon and crackers.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:52.870
Tell me something.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.070
Anything.

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:58.070
How come he calls you lambchop?

01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:01.990
Maybe it's because
I wear paper panties.

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:04.350
Paper panties?

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:06.790
I also wear a gold ring.

01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:13.830
Talk about finks.

01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:15.750
This guy's got no moons at all.

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:16.910
Never mind the moons.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:19.070
You should be out there
entertaining him.

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.590
What right has he got to treat
your wife like that?

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.910
It's a good thing
you're not my wife...

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:24.990
or I'd throw him
out of the house.

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:27.750
Yeah.

01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:30.510
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:35.910
Paper panties. Ooh.

01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:43.950
Hot stuff. Don't touch.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.630
I can't help myself.

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:48.230
How would you like
a macaroni shampoo?

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:49.270
Anything you say, baby.

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.710
Sprinkle me with parmesan.
Stab me with a breadstick.

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:54.950
You're quite
an operator, aren't you?

01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:56.870
Well, not really, but all we
have is just this one night...

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:58.030
so I have to work fast.

01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:00.710
It's sort of
an emergency operation.

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:04.670
It's that little
old winemaker, me!

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:06.590
Sit down. Sit down.

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:08.390
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:10.110
What trouble? I'm very grateful.

01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:12.430
You see, this is our fifth
wedding anniversary...

01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:13.950
and I forgot to buy
my wife a present...

01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.390
so instead, she's getting you.

01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.990
You know what they say...

01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:25.270
white wine with fish,
red wine with lambchop.

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:36.230
Believe me, it's the best thing
that could've happened to you.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.790
If I told you once, I told you
a thousand times...

01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:41.270
don't marry him.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.230
Orville J. Spooner.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.870
You know what the "j"
stands for? Jerk.

01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:46.910
That's what he is, a jerk.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:49.230
Never made more than sixty
dollars a week in his life.

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:51.590
No ambition, no future.

01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:53.190
When I think that
you could've married...

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:57.030
Wally Coates...
Dr. Wallace Coates...

01:14:57.070 --> 01:15:00.710
the second-most-successful
chiropractor in Carson City.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.350
Henry, stop rocking.

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:07.430
Or take Tom Pringle.
He was dying to marry you.

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:11.430
Only the president of the Junior
Chamber of Commerce...

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:14.470
but you let Gladys Bukitsch
grab him off.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.070
Gladys Bukitsch.

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:20.310
Four foot six, bad complexion,
pigeon-toed.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.550
I could cry.

01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:24.270
You know what he did
for her folks?

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.830
Bought them a house
in Del Webb's Sun City.

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:28.470
So now they're retired...

01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:32.270
playing shuffleboard
with the other senior citizens.

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:33.950
Oh, Zelda, Zelda...

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:35.190
what a mess you made
of your life.

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.350
That's enough, Mamie.
Now leave her alone.

01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:39.630
Did you say something?

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:41.390
Not recently.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:44.030
First thing tomorrow,
you go and see a lawyer...

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:48.870
Charlie Green, whom you also
could've married.

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:52.110
You'll have no problem
getting a divorce.

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:53.070
Just wait till I get up there...

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.470
and tell the judge
how he treated me...

01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:57.590
slamming the piano cover
on my hand...

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:01.190
just because I said
he was a no-talent slob.

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:03.750
Where are you going?

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:05.390
Home.

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.710
Back to Orville?

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:08.230
Yes, mother.

01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:10.310
He's so right about you.

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:12.310
You're a mean, loud-mouthed...

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:15.270
interfering old...

01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:16.750
you want to know
what he calls you?

01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:18.590
What?

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:20.270
I better not tell you.

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:24.230
Godzilla?

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:31.470
I'd like to propose
a toast to my beloved wife...

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.910
who has stood by me
so valiantly...

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:35.110
for the last five hours...
five years...

01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:36.710
and to our distinguished
guest...

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:38.790
star of stage, screen,
and television...

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:40.190
a man who needs
no introduction...

01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:41.710
where is he?

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:44.030
He dropped his napkin again.

01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:48.350
It seems I have
a very slippery lap.

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:50.150
Slippery lap.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:51.390
Cheers!

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:53.630
Oh! In the words
of Rossani Brazzi...

01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:56.990
grazie, grazie.

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.030
Uh, shall we move
into the living room?

01:16:59.070 --> 01:17:00.510
You go ahead.

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:01.870
I'll clear the table.

01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:03.150
No, no, Zelda. Not yet.

01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:04.110
Let's not break up the party.

01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.550
Oh, I'm with you.

01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:09.030
Oh, you don't mind if I, uh,
bring along a friend?

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:11.550
As long as you don't
bring your lobster.

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:13.430
Funny! Funny!

01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:15.510
All right. Everybody line up
for a square dance.

01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:17.390
Square dance?

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:20.870
We got wine, we got women,
and we got songs.

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:21.990
What would you like to hear?

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:23.510
Well, do you know
Old Man River?

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:25.750
Darling, why don't you play
one of your own songs.

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:26.710
One of mine?

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.750
Oh, I wouldn't want to
impose on our guest.

01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:31.510
Well, how about
"Cuddle Up a Little Closer"?

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.750
I'm sorry, but we have
a request from a lady...

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:34.790
in the balcony.

01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:35.790
Let's see now.

01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:37.710
There's this little Italian
number we wrote...

01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:39.550
which may be of some
interest to you.

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:48.390
Every day
I sit and pray I

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.790
Win you over soon

01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:53.310
Say yes, won't you?

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:54.750
Do you, don't you

01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:58.110
Want this world in tune?

01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:01.390
What does it take
to persuade you?

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:07.230
And how much more
must I serenade you?

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:09.990
Listen to me, Sophia

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:13.430
Have you any idea

01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:16.390
How much you mean to me-a?

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:20.390
How much, you'll never know

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:23.670
If I'm all agitato

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:27.310
Every heartstring vibrato

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:31.190
Every look passionato

01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:34.470
Who but you made me so?

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:38.350
It's love, it's love, crescendo

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:43.150
Never, ever diminuendo

01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:46.510
Say the word, Sweet Sophia

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:50.350
Or from earth I resign

01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:53.790
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.830
Well? What do you
think of it, huh?

01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:01.550
Oh, it's a grabber,
a real grabber.

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:02.510
It is?

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:04.070
Takes one to know one.

01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:05.350
What a great piece of material.

01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:07.430
Boy, what I could do with it.

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:10.470
You mean you like the song?

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:11.950
What song? Oh, yeah.

01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:13.550
It's another
"Arrivederci, Roma."

01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:14.510
I'll take it.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:15.470
You'll take it?

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:17.030
He'll take it!

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:19.070
Did you hear that, darling?
He'll take it!

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:21.950
Oh! Stay right
where you are, lambchop.

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.950
Play it again.

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:24.390
Yes, indeedy!

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:36.390
Listen to me, Sophia

01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:38.230
Have you any idea

01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:43.110
How much you mean to me-a?

01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:45.830
Every day more and more

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:49.510
You're sweeter than spumoni

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:53.910
Sweeter even than zabaglione

01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:56.870
Say the word, sweet Sophia

01:19:56.910 --> 01:20:00.470
Let our hearts intertwine

01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:02.350
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.150
Ole!

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:15.230
Sweet Sophia, be mine

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.350
Let that honeymoon shine

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:20.870
Pluck the grape from the vine

01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:22.830
Let our hearts

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:25.510
Let our hearts intertwine

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:28.270
And put your love on the line

01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:30.550
Sweet Sophia, be mine

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:33.230
Let the honeymoon shine

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:34.790
Paper panties.

01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:42.150
Or from earth I resign

01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:45.470
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:48.110
What's going on in there?

01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:52.310
Zelda, you're not
supposed to be here.

01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:53.790
Why not? This is my house...

01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:55.510
and that's my husband,
the swinger!

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:57.590
Now, now, Zelda, take it easy.
I know this looks pretty bad.

01:20:57.630 --> 01:20:59.830
That miserable liar,
he was telling me the truth.

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:01.990
No, he wasn't.
I mean, the truth is...

01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:03.630
Look, Zelda.
There are certain things...

01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:05.630
a man cannot ask his wife to do.

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:07.830
Like what? You mean, now she's
gonna drink out of his shoe?

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:08.950
Oh, she'll do anything.

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.750
You see, she's getting
twenty-five bucks.

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:11.710
Twenty-five bucks?

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:13.550
It's an all-night job.

01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:16.070
Well, if that doesn't
kill him, I will!

01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:17.990
Now, don't blame Orville.

01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:19.270
Actually, the whole
thing was my idea...

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:20.870
I mean, throwing you
out of the house.

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:21.830
It was?

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:23.430
And that girl... Orville
didn't even know her.

01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:25.030
I brought her around
and introduced her to him.

01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:26.070
You did?

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:27.230
And don't worry about
the money it's costing...

01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:29.070
because Orville and I,
we're going halfsies on this.

01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:30.230
You are?

01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:32.990
OK, Zelda, hit me
if you want to...

01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:34.590
but please don't go in there.

01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:35.830
You'll spoil everything.

01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:37.550
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:39.590
Atta girl. Now you go
back to your mother's...

01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:40.710
until tomorrow morning.

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.630
I'm going, all right,
but not to my mother.

01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:51.110
Oh, whew.

01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:53.350
Ole!

01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:55.910
Oh, sweet Sophia, be mine

01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:57.710
Or from earth I resign

01:21:57.710 --> 01:21:58.670
Let's...

01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:04.790
Pardon me. Pardon me.

01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:07.350
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I just got carried away.

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:08.310
Here.

01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:09.510
Don't mind me. Go right ahead.

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:11.750
Western hospitality.

01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:14.390
Listen to me, Sophia

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.630
Do you realize this is the first
song we ever sold?

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:18.030
It's a good thing
that valve cracked...

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.110
or I'd have never heard it.

01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:22.670
Yeah, and I never would have
met him... I mean you.

01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:24.950
Now, look, here's... Orville,
kiddo...

01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:27.030
I'll need one copy
for my television producer...

01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:29.190
and my orchestra leader
and my arranger...

01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:30.550
and for the guys
from the agency.

01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:31.510
Let's see.

01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:34.150
I'll need maybe, like,
uh, twelve copies.

01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:35.110
How many?

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:36.110
I hate to do this to you...

01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:37.190
but since I'm leaving
in the morning...

01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:39.910
you'll have to stay up
all night making copies.

01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:41.430
Did you say twelve?

01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:43.390
And don't you worry
about me or your wife...

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:45.030
we won't bother you.

01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:49.030
Maybe we'll go in the garden,
and she'll show me her parsley.

01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:51.590
Here we are. Sophia.

01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:54.550
Twelve copies. Isn't that lucky?

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:57.430
Yeah.

01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:59.070
How lucky can you get?

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:00.230
Oh!

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:05.030
All right, lambchop.
Refill the shoes...

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:06.750
and let's have
a little more music.

01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:08.430
What would you like to hear now?

01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:09.790
"Taps."

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:11.710
Would you be interested
in a nice little waltz?

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:13.990
"When it's
Pussy Willow Time in Picardy."

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:15.590
I don't think
I could do it justice.

01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:17.670
Here's something more lively...
what you'd call a novelty.

01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:19.630
"I'm Taking Mom
to the Junior Prom...

01:23:19.670 --> 01:23:21.830
"'Cause She's a Better Twister
Than my Sister."

01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:23.830
Gets you right here.

01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:27.470
Oh, this is it. It's a ballad.

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:29.190
I wrote it for Zelda
when we were dating.

01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:31.590
It means a lot to us.

01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:50.710
Hello?

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:52.910
Orville, are you
out of your mind?

01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:54.910
What are you trying
to do, ruin us?

01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:57.270
What do you mean?
I'm doing great.

01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:58.350
I just sold him
the Italian number.

01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:00.110
You didn't sell anything.

01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:01.430
The broad sold it.

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:02.710
So get out
of the house, already.

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:05.030
Leave the two of them alone.

01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:06.270
Oh?

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:07.230
Oh.

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:10.670
Make some excuse and beat it,
or we'll blow the whole deal.

01:24:10.710 --> 01:24:11.910
Roger.

01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:17.070
Oh, that was Roger
from the bowling alley.

01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:18.270
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news for you.

01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:19.510
Bad news?

01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:21.670
I forgot this is Saturday...
bowling night.

01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:23.310
Why didn't you remind me, Zelda?

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.910
I'm sorry.

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:26.390
You see, I'm on the Climax team.

01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:28.870
We've got this big grudge match
against Silver City.

01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:30.950
So I'm afraid I'll have to
leave you alone.

01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:32.550
What are you afraid of?

01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:34.190
Nothing, really.

01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:35.910
I'm sure you'll
look after my wife...

01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:37.870
and she'll look after you.

01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:39.110
Excuse me.

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:46.790
Something tells me
we're gonna have a ball.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.110
Won't we, lambchop?

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:04.750
Oh! The way these
matches drag on...

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:07.950
I may be gone for hours,
so don't even wait up for me.

01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:08.950
We'll be rooting for you.

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.430
No, darling. E flat.

01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:18.670
Would you play it for me
before you go?

01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:21.910
I haven't heard it
for a long time.

01:25:23.150 --> 01:25:24.070
Sure.

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.790
You don't want to miss
the first inning...

01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:30.110
or the first chukker
or whatever you call it.

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:31.270
Just one chorus.

01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:41.190
All the livelong day

01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:44.550
And the long, long night

01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:48.030
What do I do-oo-oo?

01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:52.070
Dream about you-oo-oo

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:57.870
Felt this way the first time
you came in sight

01:25:57.910 --> 01:26:04.750
Suddenly my gloomy old sky
turned magically bright

01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:09.590
You'll find
we're perfect casting

01:26:09.630 --> 01:26:12.950
You and I

01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:16.310
With love that's everlasting

01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:18.710
Will I leave you ever?

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:21.910
Never, never, never

01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:29.270
All I live for now
is to hold you tight

01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:32.150
All the livelong day

01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:36.910
And the long, long night

01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:48.950
Waiteress!

01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:51.230
Hey, waiteress!

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:58.590
Another Bloody Mary...

01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:04.670
and drinks for everybody
in the orchestra.

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:09.110
Fellas!

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:11.630
Hey, fellas.

01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:14.070
Play "Melancholy Baby."

01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:24.910
Fellas...

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:26.750
didn't you hear me?

01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:30.150
I said, play "Melancholy Baby."

01:27:30.190 --> 01:27:32.110
Come on now, everybody.

01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:33.870
Shape up!

01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:40.270
Eighty-six.

01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:45.990
Look, honey, don't you think
you had enough?

01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:47.470
No.

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:51.790
It's my anniversary.

01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:54.190
I've been married
five years today.

01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:57.070
Now, why don't you go home
and celebrate with your husband?

01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:59.390
Oh, no. He's busy.

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:01.790
You know,
I could have married...

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:04.670
the second-most-successful
chiropractor in Carson City.

01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:09.510
Instead, I married Orville J...
"j" for jerk... Spooner.

01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:15.110
I think
I'm going to be sick.

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:17.430
Uh-huh. All right,
but not in here, honey.

01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:19.430
Come on.

01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:21.470
That's it. Grab her.

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:23.110
That's a girl.

01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:28.190
Sick, sick, sick.

01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:29.870
Shall I call a cab?

01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:31.790
We can't send her home
in this condition.

01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:33.070
Don't you know who she is?

01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:34.310
I've seen her in church.

01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:35.270
She's the organist's wife...

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.070
and we're in enough trouble
already.

01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:38.070
This way.

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.990
Bang.

01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:55.950
Where's this plane going to?

01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:56.950
This isn't a plane.

01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:58.510
You're in Polly's trailer.

01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:59.830
Hello, Polly.

01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:00.790
She's gone for the night.

01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:03.150
You can sleep it off here.

01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:04.590
Hang on, everybody.

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.550
Fasten your seat belts.

01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:24.430
No chance you're taking chances

01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:28.110
Taking me on

01:29:28.150 --> 01:29:31.950
Believe me when this man says

01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:35.790
Summer, spring, and fall-time

01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:39.630
You're my one and all-time

01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:46.070
All I live for now
is to hold you tight

01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:51.630
All the livelong day

01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:57.390
And the long, long night

01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:00.270
I bet it would sound
even prettier...

01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:03.590
with like... like twenty violins.

01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:06.270
And a whole chorus of voices.

01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.670
Well, time to go.

01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:14.630
Go where?

01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:15.590
Bowling.

01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:17.510
Oh. Have a good time.

01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:19.910
No, not me. You, remember?

01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:21.830
You got a match.

01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:23.270
Oh, sure.

01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:26.150
No. A bowling match
against Silver City.

01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:28.070
And don't worry about the songs.

01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:29.270
I'll buy this one, too.

01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:31.270
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's not for sale.

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:35.110
You can have "Sophia"
or any of the others.

01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:36.710
What "Sophia"?

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:39.110
That Italian number
you were so crazy about.

01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:40.230
Oh, that.

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:41.990
I don't think we should
talk business now.

01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:44.150
I can see you two have different
things on your minds.

01:30:44.190 --> 01:30:45.510
So we'll discuss it
some other time.

01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:46.710
Like when?

01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:48.710
Oh, the next time
I come through town...

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:50.550
on my way from Vegas...

01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:53.310
if there's a detour
and if my car breaks down.

01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:54.310
Fair enough.

01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:55.950
I don't think
that's fair at all.

01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:57.750
Bye.

01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:59.550
Hold it.

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:05.350
Orville, you better run along...

01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:08.790
'cause it's not fair
to yourself or to your team.

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.230
My team?

01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:12.470
Why, Barney and everybody.

01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:15.990
You don't want
to let them down, do you?

01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:17.950
I guess I shouldn't.

01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:23.230
Oh, uh, you better put this on.
It gets chilly later.

01:31:25.150 --> 01:31:27.030
She worries about me.

01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:29.790
That's what a wife is for.

01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:33.310
Will you be
all right, darling?

01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:34.270
Well, of course she will.

01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:36.430
I'll help her with the dishes
and everything.

01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:39.590
After all, we don't want her
to have ants in the morning.

01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:45.510
Are you sure you want
to be alone with this guy?

01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:48.830
Look, mister, I got a job
to do, and you're in the way.

01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:52.230
Good-bye, darling.

01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:01.830
Come on.

01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:03.750
Come on!

01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:09.030
What took you so long?

01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:11.590
I thought I'd have to
come in and drag you out.

01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:15.750
I've been doing some thinking.

01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:16.790
Now, before he
records that song...

01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:18.990
his lawyers are gonna
send us a contract...

01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:21.030
standard royalties,
a set a copy...

01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:22.470
but we hold out...

01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:23.590
because if we can get
another of our songs...

01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:26.590
on the other side of the record,
that doubles our royalties.

01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:29.190
Why let somebody else
cash in on our hit?

01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:32.190
And if it's a big hit,
maybe he'll do the whole album.

01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:35.830
"Dino Sings Millsap
and Spooner."

01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:37.830
All right. So it's
Spooner and Millsap.

01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:40.670
Who cares so long as it sells
a million copies?

01:32:40.710 --> 01:32:42.150
Then we get a gold record.

01:32:42.190 --> 01:32:43.950
Maybe we win a Grammy award.

01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:45.830
Then come the personal
appearances...

01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:47.190
Ed Sullivan!

01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:49.350
Policemen are holding
the crowds back.

01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:50.670
Ooh! Ooh!

01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:51.830
They're throwing
jellybeans at us.

01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:53.910
He's got a hell of a nerve.

01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:54.870
Huh?

01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:57.630
Does he really think
he can buy my wife for a song?

01:32:57.670 --> 01:32:58.990
What wife? What are you
talking about?

01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.950
She's not your wife.

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:03.030
Him and his rat pack,
they think they own the earth...

01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:05.750
riding around in their white
chariots raping and looting...

01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:07.550
and wearing cuffs
on their sleeves.

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:08.750
Orville, pull yourself together.

01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:10.710
To them, we're just
a bunch of squares...

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:11.950
straight men, civilians!

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.430
Any time they want
to move in...

01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:15.190
we're supposed to
run up the white flag...

01:33:15.230 --> 01:33:18.590
hand over our homes
and our wives and our liquor!

01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:21.910
Oh, no, you don't!

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:23.870
Orville!

01:33:47.670 --> 01:33:49.190
Forget something?

01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:51.750
So you're helping
my wife with the dishes?

01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:55.110
Ha! Who's washing, and who's
drying?

01:33:55.150 --> 01:33:58.470
One thing I can't stand
is a sneaky husband.

01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:00.430
Big Hollywood hotshot.

01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:02.910
You think you can walk
in here and snap your fingers...

01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:05.270
and I'll serve my wife
to you on a silver platter...

01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:07.390
with an apple in her mouth.

01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:08.670
Get out of here.

01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:11.030
Orville, please!

01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:12.710
He doesn't mean it.

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:14.470
You heard me.

01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:16.870
O-u-t.

01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:17.830
Out!

01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:19.030
Take it easy. E-a-z-y.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:21.430
Get out of here,
or I'll throw you out.

01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:23.350
I'm going to count to five.

01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:25.350
One, two...

01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:27.150
What happened
to western hospitality?

01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:28.230
Four...

01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:29.670
five.

01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:35.110
Orville!

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:39.430
Stop it, both of you!

01:34:50.190 --> 01:34:52.790
Are you all right? Don't
mind him.

01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:54.670
He gets these fits
once in a while.

01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:56.750
He just goes crazy and starts
attacking people...

01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:58.550
milkmen and dentists
and pupils and...

01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:59.510
Oh.

01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:01.910
Are you hurt?
Is anything broken?

01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:03.350
No. I'm OK...

01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:06.750
but I'm gonna have
such a headache tomorrow.

01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:13.870
If you want action, buddy,
go to the Belly Button...

01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:17.030
but don't try to muscle in on a
happy home.

01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:24.470
Is my car ready?

01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:25.590
Just about.

01:35:25.630 --> 01:35:27.230
Look. This isn't
going to make...

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:28.830
any difference about the
song, is it?

01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:30.790
I mean, you still like it?

01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:31.790
Where is that place?

01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:32.750
What place?

01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:35.150
The Belly Button.

01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:40.270
The swine.

01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:42.190
I fixed him good.

01:35:44.110 --> 01:35:45.550
Big idiot.

01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:47.470
I'll say he is.

01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:49.670
I mean you.

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:52.270
You fixed yourself good.

01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:53.710
You had everything
going for you...

01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:54.990
and you went and loused it up.

01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:56.070
Why?

01:35:56.110 --> 01:35:58.710
I didn't want him to think
you were a pushover.

01:35:58.750 --> 01:36:00.590
What difference does it make?

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:03.270
One man more or less
in my life.

01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:07.870
I'm Polly the Pistol, remember?

01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:10.870
I come highly recommended
by the bartender.

01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:13.830
Well, I'm not the bartender,
and you're not Polly...

01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:15.070
not tonight.

01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:18.870
Tonight, we're Mr. And Mrs.
Orville J. Spooner.

01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:27.790
Look at this mess.

01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:33.390
What does the "j"
stand for?

01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:34.390
James?

01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:36.870
No.

01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:39.710
Joseph?

01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.190
Uh-uh.

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.070
Jasper?

01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:47.270
Jeremiah.

01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:50.950
I'm sorry I asked.

01:37:02.190 --> 01:37:03.910
Don't throw that away.

01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:06.110
There may be a deposit on it.

01:37:06.150 --> 01:37:07.590
All right, dear.

01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:35.430
Cold getting worse?

01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:37.510
It's not my cold.

01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:44.430
It's been a long day,
hasn't it?

01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:45.910
Yes, dear.

01:37:59.830 --> 01:38:01.830
Coming, Mrs. Spooner?

01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:58.270
Hey, pal. Those gorgeous
cocktail waitresses...

01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:59.390
I heard so much about...

01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:00.350
Yes, sir?

01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:01.310
Where are they?

01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:02.630
This is it.

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:03.590
You must be kidding.

01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:05.390
I've seen better navels on
oranges.

01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:06.950
Take that redhead over there.

01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:08.870
She was runner-up
to Miss Nevada.

01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:11.070
What year? Come on, pal.

01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:12.710
Where do you keep
the real stuff?

01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:15.470
The most popular one
around here is Polly the Pistol.

01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:16.710
Polly the Pistol?

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.630
You can't go wrong with her.

01:39:18.670 --> 01:39:20.550
Fastest draw in the west.

01:39:20.590 --> 01:39:22.950
Now you're talking.
Where is she?

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.750
Must be her night off.

01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:25.910
Oh, that's too bad...

01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:28.270
because I'd sure like
to shoot it out with her.

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:29.830
Why don't you
try the trailer?

01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:31.990
That's where she lives,
right behind the place.

01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.950
Which way?

01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:34.230
That-a-way.

01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:35.190
That way?

01:39:35.230 --> 01:39:37.590
Well, if I'm not back by
morning...

01:39:37.630 --> 01:39:38.950
you send a posse
out after me.

01:40:01.150 --> 01:40:02.110
Bang!

01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:12.030
Open up!

01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:15.070
I know you're in there.

01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:20.710
We got the place surrounded,
and I'm coming in to get you.

01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:24.430
Who is it?

01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:26.950
The Lone Ranger.

01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:30.350
What do you want?

01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:32.030
I told you. I'm Ione.

01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:34.150
I'm so Ione like you
wouldn't believe.

01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:36.230
Go away!

01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:39.470
That's no way
to treat a customer.

01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:41.470
Where do you keep your glasses?

01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:51.470
Are you going to get out,
or do I have to call for help?

01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:55.230
From what I hear, you don't
need any help, Polly baby.

01:40:57.230 --> 01:40:58.750
You're...

01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:59.710
you're Dino.

01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:01.750
No names, please.

01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:04.110
I thought I saw you
driving through town.

01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:06.030
I didn't make it.
My car broke down.

01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:08.430
They put me up
with some piano teacher.

01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:10.790
Piano... Orville Spooner?

01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:12.630
That's the joker.

01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:16.910
What an evening.

01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:17.990
What happened?

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:20.270
Ah, these amateurs, what they
won't do to sell a song.

01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:21.790
He kept throwing his wife at me.

01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:22.790
His wife?

01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:24.510
Yeah. Get the scene?

01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:25.630
I'm beginning to.

01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:27.630
Not a bad-Iooking dame,
if you like home cooking...

01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:29.270
but me, I like to eat out...

01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:31.070
you know, Chinese one night...

01:41:31.110 --> 01:41:32.750
a little French cuisine
another...

01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:35.630
and a little delicatessen
in between.

01:41:35.630 --> 01:41:37.190
Drink up, baby.

01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:40.310
What song did he play you?

01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:42.390
"Sophia"?

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:43.790
How did you know?

01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:45.590
Did you like it?

01:41:45.630 --> 01:41:47.110
I need another Italian song...

01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:49.310
like a giraffe needs
a strep throat.

01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:53.390
Well, I think Orville has a
lot of talent.

01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:55.110
You know him?

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:57.870
See him almost every night.

01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:59.310
He's one of my regulars.

01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:03.990
That mousy little guy
with the Beethoven on his chest?

01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:06.310
No. He's a real swinger.

01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:09.510
What do you think
you're doing?

01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:11.430
Guess.

01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:17.030
No coaching from the audience.

01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:21.990
Look. You don't understand.
This is my night off.

01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:25.190
Well, it's my night on,
Polly, baby...

01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:28.710
and if you're worried
about money, I tip large.

01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:40.430
Anyway, in my opinion,
you're all wrong for it.

01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:43.350
I'm all wrong for what?

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.470
That song.

01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:45.510
I told Orville
he should send it...

01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:47.110
to Bobby Darin or Elvis.

01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:48.350
Elvis who?

01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:50.270
I suppose you never
heard of the Beatles, either.

01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:53.110
Oh, sure, and I can sing better
than all three of them.

01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:54.150
There are four of them.

01:42:54.190 --> 01:42:55.230
Oh, haven't you heard?

01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:56.670
One of them got his hair
caught in his guitar...

01:42:56.710 --> 01:42:58.070
and was electrocuted.

01:42:58.110 --> 01:42:59.710
You can make jokes about
them...

01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:01.550
but they're young
and they're popular...

01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:03.070
while you...

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.910
What about me?

01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:07.110
Let's face it.
You're over the hill.

01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:09.150
Sure do know how
to hurt a fella.

01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:10.670
I'm sorry,
but can you imagine...

01:43:10.710 --> 01:43:12.630
what Jack Jones
could do with that song?

01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:13.750
What?

01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:16.470
Listen to me, Sophia

01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:17.870
Have you any idea

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:18.830
Now look, lady.

01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:19.870
You may have heard
a lot of singers...

01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:22.830
but you ain't heard nothing sung
till you heard me sung it.

01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:25.870
Oh, listen to me, Sophia

01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:28.750
Have you any idea

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:32.590
How much you mean to me-a?

01:43:32.630 --> 01:43:37.110
How much, you'll never know

01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:38.790
Then, of course,
there's Robert Goulet.

01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:41.670
If I'm all agitato

01:43:41.710 --> 01:43:44.390
Every heartstring vibrato

01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:48.150
Every kiss passionato

01:43:48.190 --> 01:43:49.470
And Eddie Fisher.

01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:52.710
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:56.270
Sweet Sophia, be mine

01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:41.590
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:44.990
Sweet Sophia, be mine

01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:05.950
Dino!

01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:09.270
Hey, Dino! Dino!

01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:10.750
Dino!

01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:43.310
Well, good-bye, Mr. Spooner.

01:45:45.230 --> 01:45:47.150
What's the matter?

01:45:47.150 --> 01:45:49.070
I'm contemplating.

01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:50.510
Contemplating what?

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:51.950
Suicide.

01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:53.870
What are you talking about?

01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:55.310
Look at me...

01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:58.630
yesterday, a solid citizen,
a blood donor...

01:45:58.670 --> 01:46:04.390
a signer of petitions,
and today, the way of all flesh.

01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:10.230
Nonsense. You spent the night
with Mrs. Spooner, remember?

01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:11.590
Yeah.

01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:13.990
That's right.

01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:17.270
Here you are.

01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:18.750
What's that?

01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:19.870
It's your pay.

01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:22.670
You know, the deal
we made? Twenty-five dollars?

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:25.950
You wouldn't pay
your wife, would you?

01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:28.070
But you need the money if
you're saving up for that car.

01:46:28.110 --> 01:46:29.070
What car?

01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:30.630
I gave up on that
a long time ago.

01:46:30.670 --> 01:46:32.470
I'll never get out of this town.

01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:33.750
Don't say that.

01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:35.230
Oh, you don't have to worry.

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:37.510
If we ever
run into each other...

01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:40.350
I'll pretend
I never even met you.

01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:41.830
Thanks.

01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:45.190
Nice to have met you.

01:46:46.630 --> 01:46:49.950
I wish there were something
I could do for you.

01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:51.870
You've done a lot.

01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:55.990
For instance,
you cured me of my cold.

01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:57.350
Bye.

01:47:18.710 --> 01:47:21.910
You're just in time.
I'm making coffee.

01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:24.550
Would you like some?

01:47:25.710 --> 01:47:27.310
Don't look so surprised.

01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:29.990
You took my place last night,
so I took yours.

01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:31.710
It's that simple.

01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:35.310
Oh, then you must be Mrs...

01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:36.590
That's right.

01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:38.230
Where do you keep the cups?

01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:47.310
Look. Whatever your husband did,
he did it for you.

01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:50.230
Whatever I did,
I did it for him.

01:47:52.630 --> 01:47:54.710
I've never stayed
in a trailer before.

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:56.710
It's really quite cozy.

01:47:56.750 --> 01:48:00.190
I liked your house,
especially that big kitchen.

01:48:00.230 --> 01:48:01.710
I made waffles this morning.

01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:03.630
I'll bet there was no syrup.

01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:06.030
I opened up a jar
of your preserves.

01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:10.310
You know, it was sort of fun
being a wife for a night.

01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:11.750
And for one night...

01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:14.630
it was fun being
Polly the Pistol.

01:48:14.670 --> 01:48:16.670
Oh.

01:48:16.710 --> 01:48:18.510
This belongs to you.

01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:19.470
Me?

01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:22.950
Five hundred dollars?

01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:25.190
Large spender from out of town.

01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:27.590
Why don't I ever meet
anybody like that?

01:48:27.630 --> 01:48:28.710
I think you did...

01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:30.070
but you were married at the
time.

01:48:30.110 --> 01:48:33.870
You really want
to give this to me?

01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:36.750
I'll swap you
for that ring.

01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:41.510
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:43.430
And if you should
find a loose navel...

01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:46.110
floating around the house,
it's mine.

01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:48.430
I'm not going back home.

01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:49.590
You're not?

01:48:49.630 --> 01:48:51.110
I'm moving in with my folks.

01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:54.150
Maybe I shouldn't butt in...

01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:56.590
but I think you're
making a mistake.

01:48:56.630 --> 01:49:01.390
If I were you... and I was...
I wouldn't leave Orville.

01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:05.430
A woman without a man is like
a trailer without a car.

01:49:05.470 --> 01:49:06.870
You ain't going nowhere.

01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:10.950
So when you find a good guy,
you should stick to him.

01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:14.710
I deal with married men
all the time, the heels.

01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:18.070
Believe me, you got
a wonderful husband.

01:49:18.110 --> 01:49:21.270
I know that, but he'll be
an even better husband...

01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:22.430
when I get through with him.

01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:29.350
What was that
about a loose navel?

01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:11.030
- Hi there, Mr. Spooner.
- Hi.

01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:12.070
Mrs. Spooner around?

01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:13.510
- Why?
- I was just wondering.

01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:15.310
For the last three days,
she hasn't ordered anything...

01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:17.070
no milk, no butter, no eggs.

01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:19.590
Well, we've been eating out.

01:50:19.630 --> 01:50:21.070
I... I mean,
she's been eating out.

01:50:21.110 --> 01:50:22.070
As a matter of fact...

01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:23.110
she's been living out
with her parents...

01:50:23.150 --> 01:50:24.910
but it's only temporary.

01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:26.710
Just a little
misunderstanding.

01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:28.750
You know how it is
with married...

01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:31.550
none of your damn business!

01:51:34.670 --> 01:51:36.230
Oh, it's you.

01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:38.310
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from here?

01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:40.150
Wait a minute, Orville.
I've got a message for you.

01:51:40.190 --> 01:51:41.830
Big genius.

01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:43.310
"We're going to be rich,"
you said.

01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:45.270
"Just get rid of your wife
for one night."

01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:47.430
Well, I got rid of her,
all right. Permanently!

01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:48.430
She doesn't want to see me.

01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:49.510
She doesn't want to talk to me.

01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:50.750
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:52.270
I've got a message from Zelda.

01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:55.230
You fat, miserable,
no-good slob!

01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:56.430
Get lost!

01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:02.030
What message?

01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:03.630
So I'm a fat slob, huh?

01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:04.910
Well, come on. Come on.

01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:06.470
I just talked to Zelda.

01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:07.550
She wants to see you.

01:52:07.590 --> 01:52:08.950
- She does?
- Uh-huh.

01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:10.630
Oh, you beautiful man!

01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:11.870
Where? When?

01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:14.350
8:00 tonight at her lawyer's.

01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:15.310
Her lawyer?

01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:16.710
Charlie Green.
You know, upstairs...

01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:18.390
over Pringle's hardware store.

01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:19.350
Why?

01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:21.350
Why do you think? Divorce.

01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:22.550
Divorce?

01:52:22.590 --> 01:52:24.430
Oh, Barney, this is crazy.
I love her.

01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:25.590
I know...

01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:28.710
but that's the way she wants it.

01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:31.590
Why don't you just bring me
a five-gallon can of gasoline...

01:52:31.630 --> 01:52:32.550
and a match?

01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:33.870
That's no way to talk...

01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:35.310
because I'm gonna
be there, too...

01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:36.750
as a witness.

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:38.870
Oh, good.

01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:40.710
Then you can swear
how it was all your idea...

01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:41.910
that you put me up to it.

01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:43.510
You don't understand, Orville.

01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:46.350
I'm going to be
a witness for her.

01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:47.470
For her?

01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:50.750
The way you treated
that poor girl.

01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:53.670
You shouldn't
have done it, Orville.

01:52:53.710 --> 01:52:55.390
I shouldn't?

01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:58.790
Why, you fat, miserable slob.

01:52:58.830 --> 01:53:01.830
See you at the lawyer's
at 8:00 sharp.

01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:34.110
Zelda, before we go up there,
I've got to talk to you.

01:53:34.150 --> 01:53:35.750
I warn you, you're not
to make any statements...

01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:37.430
except in the presence
of your lawyer.

01:53:37.470 --> 01:53:38.830
You shut up!

01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:40.790
The way I treated you
was unforgivable...

01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:41.830
but if you'll forgive me...

01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:43.510
everything will be
different from now on.

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:44.710
There will be
no more jealousy...

01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:47.270
no more suspicion,
no more cross-examining.

01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:48.710
And your eyes are not pink.

01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:50.510
Too little and too late.

01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:52.670
We've drawn up a temporary
property settlement.

01:53:52.710 --> 01:53:53.870
You get the piano...

01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:56.270
the pictures of Beethoven,
and the classical records.

01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:59.670
She gets the popular records,
the bed, and the love seat.

01:53:59.710 --> 01:54:01.110
Let's go.

01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:03.470
Zelda, remember
five years ago...

01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:05.430
when we exchanged
wedding rings...

01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:09.310
we promised for richer,
poorer, better, worse?

01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:10.670
Where is your ring?

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:13.150
My ring? Oh, yeah.

01:54:13.190 --> 01:54:15.350
You want to know where it is?

01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:16.310
It's in the shower.

01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:17.750
Slipped off,
went down the drain.

01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:19.870
You see, I've lost a lot
of weight since you left.

01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:22.710
What's that song
they're playing?

01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:23.910
Stick to the subject...

01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:25.230
the case of the missing ring.

01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:26.790
Don't worry, Zelda.
I'll get it back.

01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:29.190
Maybe with a string
and a piece of chewing gum...

01:54:29.230 --> 01:54:31.950
or better yet,
we'Il... we'll call a plumber.

01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:38.710
Either that's "Sophia,"
or somebody stole it from us.

01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:40.710
And now, the star of our show...

01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:43.150
direct from a successful
appearance at the bar...

01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:44.350
Dino.

01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:45.790
Dino?

01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:51.710
Listen to me, Sophia

01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:55.470
Have you any idea

01:54:56.750 --> 01:55:00.670
How much you mean to me-a?

01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:03.790
How much, you'll never know

01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:08.110
If I'm all agitato

01:55:09.190 --> 01:55:12.590
Every heartstring vibrato

01:55:12.630 --> 01:55:13.790
I don't understand it.

01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:15.430
Why would he sing our song
after what I did to him?

01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:16.910
I guess the bigger they are...

01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:18.350
the nicer they are.

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:20.630
Who but you made me so?

01:55:20.670 --> 01:55:22.750
Look at it.
It's on all twelve sets!

01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:24.510
Twelve sets, my eye.

01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:26.630
Thirty million people
are watching this show.

01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:29.430
A Nielsen rating of 21.7.

01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:31.110
Did you hear that, darling? Do
you know what this means?

01:55:31.150 --> 01:55:32.190
Sure.

01:55:32.230 --> 01:55:33.830
I'll have Charlie Green
ask for more alimony.

01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:35.670
- Zelda!
- Shh.

01:55:35.710 --> 01:55:37.510
I can't hear my words.

01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:41.750
Or from earth I resign

01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:46.150
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:55:52.230 --> 01:55:54.390
Thank you. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:56.670
Now, isn't it a gas, that song?

01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:57.830
Found it myself...

01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:59.910
and there's an interesting
story behind it.

01:55:59.950 --> 01:56:01.950
I was on my way
back from Vegas...

01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:05.030
and I stopped in a place
called Climax, Nevada.

01:56:05.070 --> 01:56:06.310
Lovely little town...

01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:08.710
and I heard one
of the natives humming a tune...

01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:12.230
and as I drove away,
that melody kept haunting me...

01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:13.190
you know...

01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:15.870
so I turned around
and went back...

01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:18.150
and there were these
two amateur songwriters...

01:56:18.190 --> 01:56:21.030
Miller and Spoonsap,
uh, Moonsap and Spiller.

01:56:21.070 --> 01:56:23.070
Millsap and Spooner.

01:56:23.110 --> 01:56:24.910
Spooner and Millsap.

01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:25.990
Well, anyway...

01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:28.430
I stayed up all night
listening to their songs...

01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:29.870
and tonight,
you're hearing one of them...

01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:30.830
for the first time...

01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:31.830
which just goes to prove...

01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:33.630
that if you've got
what it takes...

01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:36.790
sooner or later, somebody
will take what you've got...

01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:38.150
baby.

01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:41.590
Listen to me, Sophia

01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:44.790
Have you any idea

01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:47.310
Can we have your autographs?

01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:48.870
This way, please.

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:52.350
How much, you'll never know

01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:55.990
Imagine, just this morning,
he was checking my mother's oil.

01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:57.990
I bet you're going to make,
like, a million dollars.

01:56:58.030 --> 01:57:01.030
Who cares? In our bracket,
the government gets most of it.

01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:02.630
Will you sign this for me?

01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:05.750
Can't we try again, lambchop?

01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:06.870
How would it look
when Barney and I...

01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:07.910
are on "The Ed Sullivan Show"...

01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:09.390
and he wants you
to stand up and take a bow...

01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:11.030
and you're not in the audience?

01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:12.750
You can always get someone to
take my place.

01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:13.830
Who'll know the difference?

01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:15.750
Yeah.

01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:16.870
What do you mean?

01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:18.190
Will you sign this for me?

01:57:18.230 --> 01:57:19.270
- Me, too.
- Here.

01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:20.310
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:29.990
Listen to me, Sophia

01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:31.470
He's no Valentino

01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:33.710
Have you any idea

01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:35.070
But there's no one we know

01:57:35.110 --> 01:57:37.750
How much you mean to me-a?

01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:38.910
Who can love like Dino

01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:41.430
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:45.270
All the others were so-so

01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:46.750
Skinny like a pony

01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:49.190
Not a one amoroso

01:57:49.230 --> 01:57:50.630
Thin as macaroni

01:57:50.670 --> 01:57:53.510
But with you, I'm aglow

01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:54.990
Bang, bang.

01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:57.670
Only you I adore

01:57:58.630 --> 01:58:02.830
She's sweeter than spumoni

01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:04.590
She's a manicurist I met.

01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:06.510
I had my nails done
while you were gone.

01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:08.430
- I'm not asking any questions.
- That's right.

01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:09.950
There's going to be
no more questions.

01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:11.790
Here. You'd better put this on.

01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:13.230
My ring.

01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:14.710
When our hearts intertwine

01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:15.670
Where did you get it?

01:58:15.710 --> 01:58:17.030
No questions, remember?

01:58:17.070 --> 01:58:18.750
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:20.230
I must be going out of my mind.

01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:22.190
I can't figure out any of this.

01:58:22.230 --> 01:58:23.710
Any of what?

01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:27.110
I mean, the ring and the song
and the car and Dino.

01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:28.990
How would you?

01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.990
When did she?

01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:31.350
Why would he?

01:58:32.710 --> 01:58:34.510
Kiss me, stupid.

01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:45.190
Oh, Sophia, be mine

01:58:46.305 --> 01:58:52.450
