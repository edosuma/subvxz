00:28.210 --> 00:30.489
- Senator...
- That's okay, that's okay.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.919
People want to know why you're in favor

00:31.920 --> 00:33.739
of lifting sanctions against Russia.

00:33.740 --> 00:35.349
What I'm in favor of is ending the conflict

00:35.350 --> 00:36.899
between Russia and Ukraine

00:36.900 --> 00:38.790
and allowing our Ukrainian
friends to join NATO.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.829
That's what this peace summit is all about.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.699
Can you comment on a recent
article that accuses

00:41.700 --> 00:43.719
your campaign of being in ties with Russia?

00:43.720 --> 00:44.959
That article was fake news.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.989
A smear tactic targeting
my re-election campaign.

00:46.990 --> 00:48.999
Are you suggesting your low
poll numbers are a result

00:49.000 --> 00:49.830
of Russian hacking?

00:49.831 --> 00:52.949
Let me be clear. I've never
received any money from Russia.

00:52.950 --> 00:53.450
Ever.

00:53.451 --> 00:55.256
- All right, that's all we have time for.
- Thank you.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.069
Michael, I thought you were looking
into this fake news article.

00:58.070 --> 00:59.560
Still working on it, but we do know

00:59.570 --> 01:02.169
it's not connected to any
legitimate news source.

01:02.170 --> 01:05.770
So some basement blogger is
gonna lose me this election.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.590
I need a drink.

01:09.870 --> 01:10.870
Please.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.400
Anna?

01:39.500 --> 01:40.490
There you are.

01:40.491 --> 01:41.810
Hi, sweetie.

01:41.820 --> 01:43.210
How was your day?

01:43.230 --> 01:44.809
Exhausting. How's the shopping?

01:44.810 --> 01:46.069
Oh, fantastic.

01:46.070 --> 01:48.849
I just bought the cutest
little pair of red pumps.

01:48.850 --> 01:50.970
To go along with the six
pairs you brought with you?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.779
- Honey...
- Oh, come on..

01:52.780 --> 01:54.379
Oh my God...

01:54.380 --> 01:56.950
Your obsession with shoes
is really getting...

01:57.610 --> 01:59.280
No! Help!

01:59.630 --> 02:00.630
Anna?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.020
Anna, what's happening?

02:04.540 --> 02:05.540
Anna!

02:09.590 --> 02:10.989
Go home, you Moskali dog,

02:10.990 --> 02:13.100
or you'll never see your wife again.

02:13.690 --> 02:14.830
Who is this?

02:15.580 --> 02:17.390
Where's my wife? Anna!

02:22.190 --> 02:23.580
Short line at customs?

02:23.820 --> 02:25.449
Perks of a diplomatic passport.

02:25.450 --> 02:26.970
Why not just call it what it is?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.379
Get out of jail free card
for the well connected.

02:29.380 --> 02:30.589
Where's Hart, by the way?

02:30.590 --> 02:32.059
Flew in from London. Arrived this morning.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.909
Oh, good, so the world has the carbon tax

02:33.910 --> 02:35.799
because some senator's wife got snatched.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.640
It's not just any senator.

02:36.641 --> 02:38.629
Mitch Warren's on the
armed services committee.

02:38.630 --> 02:41.609
Also a close personal friend to the
Director of National Intelligence.

02:41.610 --> 02:43.089
Oh, favor job. Even better.

02:43.090 --> 02:45.189
Hey, where's my stuff?

02:45.190 --> 02:46.599
The most cutting edge computer equipment

02:46.600 --> 02:47.260
on the face of the planet?

02:47.261 --> 02:48.750
Yeah, keep your shirt on.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.130
Okay, good.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.380
Wait a minute.

02:52.390 --> 02:53.620
Oh, that's nice.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.570
Whoa, weapons.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.970
Kevlar.

03:01.770 --> 03:03.130
Stun grenades.

03:03.660 --> 03:04.699
This is some rental.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.919
What's the daily rate on a rig like this?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.999
I traded a truck full
of Soviet SA-7s for it.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.100
Obviously.

03:11.340 --> 03:12.419
All right, this is Hart.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.279
Mills, she wants me to
drop you off at the hotel,

03:14.280 --> 03:15.509
take you to the safe house, get you set up.

03:15.510 --> 03:17.580
- Okay, whatever.
- All right.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.680
My associate, Bryan Mills.

03:21.110 --> 03:23.170
Michael Fortman, campaign manager.

03:23.650 --> 03:25.399
- Thanks for coming.
- Sir.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.369
Beth Childers, Senator's
personal secretary.

03:28.370 --> 03:30.540
This is Theo, Warren's body guard.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.510
Nasty cut.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.449
I was just, uh, telling them,

03:35.450 --> 03:37.180
me and Anna, we get to the car.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.600
I... I, uh, open the trunk...

03:40.360 --> 03:42.149
I see this guy out of the corner of my eye

03:42.150 --> 03:45.130
wearing some kind of a
silver skeleton mask.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.179
Next thing I know, I wake up,

03:46.180 --> 03:48.430
and Anna and the guy are gone.

03:49.370 --> 03:50.800
Who else knew your itinerary?

03:51.330 --> 03:53.040
No one outside the office.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.560
Did you notice anyone following you?

03:56.030 --> 03:57.030
No.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.629
Thank you, Theo. You can go now.

04:00.630 --> 04:01.780
But please keep this to yourself.

04:01.790 --> 04:04.610
We don't want anyone outside this
room knowing what's happened.

04:08.190 --> 04:10.429
Please don't judge Theo too harshly.

04:10.430 --> 04:11.859
The fact is he was sloppy.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.750
Yes, I suppose.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.449
But Theo and Anna have been there for me

04:15.450 --> 04:17.349
ever since my first wife passed away.

04:17.350 --> 04:18.959
I understand Anna was a volunteer

04:18.970 --> 04:20.478
on your first senate campaign.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.750
After Brook died, she began
taking my son to school.

04:24.190 --> 04:25.980
Picking him up from practice.

04:26.270 --> 04:28.050
Helping him with his homework.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.450
We both just fell in love with her.

04:32.690 --> 04:33.999
I don't know where Brett
and I would be today

04:34.000 --> 04:35.440
if it wasn't for Anna.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.409
Did the kidnapper make any demands?

04:39.410 --> 04:40.670
More like a threat.

04:41.050 --> 04:43.729
Told the senator to go home or
he'd never see his wife again.

04:43.730 --> 04:45.690
Would you like to hear the call?

04:45.700 --> 04:46.889
You have the call on tape?

04:46.890 --> 04:48.459
All calls to the senator's cell phone

04:48.460 --> 04:51.059
are recorded automatically and
uploaded to a secure server

04:51.060 --> 04:53.509
- for later transcription.
- Fantastic.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.639
I just bought the cutest
little pair of red pumps.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.580
To go along with the six
pairs you brought with you?

04:57.590 --> 04:59.199
- Oh, come on. They...

04:59.200 --> 05:00.559
Oh, my God... oh, my...

05:00.560 --> 05:03.370
- No! Help!
- Anna, what's happening?

05:04.050 --> 05:05.780
Anna, what's going on?

05:06.220 --> 05:07.220
Anna?

05:07.770 --> 05:09.179
Go home, you Moskali dog,

05:09.180 --> 05:10.839
or you'll never see your wife again.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.020
What is that word? Moskali?

05:13.040 --> 05:14.550
It's Ukrainian slang.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.459
It's a reference to your ties with Russia.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.280
But I don't have any ties.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.780
People only know what they read.

05:21.690 --> 05:24.650
So now these ridiculous rumors
are gonna cost me my wife?

05:26.680 --> 05:28.390
I want Anna found.

05:28.490 --> 05:30.349
And her kidnappers brought to justice.

05:30.350 --> 05:32.930
And I need it done quickly and quietly.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.710
Don't worry, Senator.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.040
We'll do our very best to find her.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.079
Yikes.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.139
What'd you trade for this place?

05:44.140 --> 05:45.819
A couple ICBMs?

05:45.820 --> 05:46.940
It's AirBNB.

05:47.690 --> 05:48.690
Look at that.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.489
Roche Bobois sofa.

05:50.490 --> 05:53.650
The standard bearer for Euro trash chic.

05:54.380 --> 05:55.810
Oh, super comfy, though.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.129
I didn't pick this place for the furniture.

05:57.130 --> 05:59.180
I picked it for the view.

05:59.370 --> 06:01.569
You should be able to get the
clear, secure satellite link up

06:01.570 --> 06:03.830
- through this window.
- Yeah, okay.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.599
Well, I'm gonna hunker down.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.460
I'm gonna need some fuel.

06:06.461 --> 06:07.770
We get per diem, right?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.029
Yeah, what do you need?

06:09.030 --> 06:10.000
Caffeine? Red Bull?

06:10.001 --> 06:11.819
Come on, man. We're in Brussels.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.749
Let's get some, uh, steak frites, right?

06:13.750 --> 06:14.600
Some mayo.

06:14.601 --> 06:17.759
How about a nice, uh, Belgian ale?

06:17.760 --> 06:19.599
Oh, okay. Any other requests?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.299
Uh, waffles with strawberries, right?

06:21.300 --> 06:23.289
- We're in Belgium.
- I'll get right on that.

06:23.290 --> 06:24.529
- Thank you.
- All right.

06:24.530 --> 06:25.999
It's just standard procedures.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.570
All ops need to be deconflicted with...

06:29.740 --> 06:32.030
the CIA's Chief of Station.

06:35.010 --> 06:36.189
Nice to see you, Christina.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.360
You, too, Brie.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.900
This is my associate Bryan Mills.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
Ma'am.

06:42.090 --> 06:44.379
Christina and I were
agency newbies together.

06:44.380 --> 06:47.920
- Haven't seen you since, uh...
- Moscow, 2000.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.850
And now you're Chief of Station.

06:54.350 --> 06:56.700
Sounds glamorous, but
it's mostly political.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.520
So, Christina, what brings
you to my neck of the woods?

07:02.540 --> 07:05.069
Uh, we're here under diplomatic cover.

07:05.070 --> 07:06.689
The NI has asked us to help them

07:06.690 --> 07:08.099
with a missing persons case.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.280
But it doesn't touch on CIA equities.

07:11.740 --> 07:12.929
I mean, so far.

07:12.930 --> 07:14.170
But I'll let you know.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.470
Actually, we need to go.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.670
I was hoping for more of a reunion.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.450
- Rain check?
- Sure.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.210
Yeah?

07:28.211 --> 07:29.890
So I was able to track the news story

07:29.900 --> 07:31.919
about the senator's ties to Russia.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.709
- And?
- And it actually originated from a server in Ukraine.

07:35.710 --> 07:38.510
Controlled by a militant
nationalist group called Red Hate.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.490
I've heard of them.

07:39.491 --> 07:41.300
Staunchly anti-Russian.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.520
Yeah, also known for
distributing propaganda,

07:43.530 --> 07:45.649
hacking, kidnapping, a little murder.

07:45.650 --> 07:46.300
All right, look.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.090
Look what I pulled off their web site.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.730
Santana, I want you and Mills
on the next flight to Ukraine.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.600
You sure this is the right place?

08:09.300 --> 08:11.340
Kilroy tracked the server to this address.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.090
We're being watched.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.140
Let's see if anybody's home.

08:20.850 --> 08:21.960
- Hello?
- Mills!

08:22.790 --> 08:25.320
- Anyone there?
- Take it easy! Mills!

08:29.120 --> 08:30.270
They won't come to us,

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
we'll go to them.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.010
What are you doing?

08:33.010 --> 08:34.958
You opted for the full
insurance package, right?

08:34.960 --> 08:36.600
Yeah. So?

08:36.960 --> 08:38.429
You got nothing to worry about.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.640
Drop it!

09:22.730 --> 09:23.730
Great plan.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.899
Now, just FYI, I used
my personal credit card

09:37.900 --> 09:39.079
to rent that vehicle.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.519
The company will reimburse you.

09:40.520 --> 09:41.739
That's not the point.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.659
You were reckless, and now
we're both prisoners.

09:43.660 --> 09:45.390
Well, at least you're inside.

09:54.090 --> 09:58.170
You come here, you attack my home,

09:58.320 --> 10:00.210
you disturb my kitchen.

10:02.890 --> 10:06.399
I said to myself, whoever
these two heroes are,

10:06.400 --> 10:08.520
they must have a death wish.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.230
So, any last words?

10:11.870 --> 10:14.500
I hear that Red Hate makes the best salo.

10:16.260 --> 10:19.479
Ah, you have tasted salo.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.600
Many times.

10:21.310 --> 10:24.370
I was in the Ukraine for the
first Battle of Mariupol.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.580
My team supported Spetznek
Sumiga at Timietzky.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.170
I remember. I was there, too.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.470
Dozens of separatists were killed.

10:38.490 --> 10:41.430
Libiki was a great commander, hmm?

10:41.750 --> 10:44.219
Three separatists were killed,

10:44.220 --> 10:46.160
but 60 were captured.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.530
And it was Zupko who led the unit.

10:58.690 --> 11:01.560
Hardest days came after your team left.

11:02.670 --> 11:04.030
Your hands.

11:08.190 --> 11:11.300
I will never forget the
help you gave us, hmm?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.340
I'm Christian.

11:14.930 --> 11:15.930
Bryan.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.460
So, what can I do for you comrade, hmm?

11:22.180 --> 11:25.699
Someone wearing a mask like this

11:25.700 --> 11:27.859
just kidnapped the wife of a US senator.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.939
That mask is a symbol of
resistance used by many

11:29.940 --> 11:31.439
in our situation.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.279
You also posted an article online claiming

11:33.280 --> 11:35.400
the same senator had ties with Russia.

11:37.010 --> 11:38.010
Ande.

11:42.570 --> 11:46.369
It's true, but the post came
from an outside contributor.

11:46.370 --> 11:48.290
We have many.

11:51.750 --> 11:52.920
I'm gonna need a name.

11:52.930 --> 11:55.100
That just won't be possible.

11:56.610 --> 12:00.160
You see, while I do not condone
the kidnappings of Americans,

12:00.170 --> 12:02.559
I must protect the
identities of those fighting

12:02.560 --> 12:04.089
on the front lines.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.640
Even if they're sadistic subversives?

12:08.680 --> 12:11.459
You're more than welcome to
stay and share our salo.

12:11.460 --> 12:14.699
And horilka, of course.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.570
- We'd be delighted.
- Yeah.

12:26.590 --> 12:28.250
So much for being vegan.

12:30.820 --> 12:34.120
I have to thank you for your hospitality.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.810
But unfortunately we have to go.

12:45.660 --> 12:47.959
Ivan, I'm sure our new
friends will find a way

12:47.960 --> 12:50.360
to make it up to us, hmm? Right, Bryan?

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
Of course.

13:00.590 --> 13:03.460
Thank you for this.

13:09.530 --> 13:11.730
What are you doing? You lose something?

13:12.540 --> 13:14.040
You need to be careful.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.090
A lot of personal
information on your phone.

13:17.910 --> 13:19.420
You never know who might find it.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.680
What do you want?

13:21.050 --> 13:23.759
I need to know who wrote the
article about Senator Warren.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.060
I can't tell you that.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.200
This your wife?

13:27.230 --> 13:28.230
Hilia?

13:29.880 --> 13:31.660
Does she know you're having an affair?

13:34.210 --> 13:36.890
Judging by these texts,
it's been going on a while.

13:37.970 --> 13:40.040
- Perhaps I should say something.
- No.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.230
- Please.
- Give me a name.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.730
You're running out of time.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.900
His name is Serge Ivanavich.

13:51.610 --> 13:52.860
You could do better.

13:58.980 --> 14:01.909
Serge Ivanavich is a Ukrainian activist

14:01.910 --> 14:04.169
who likes to post protest
videos to social media.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.169
- What's he doing?
- Burning the Russian flag.

14:06.170 --> 14:06.760
Subtle.

14:06.761 --> 14:08.380
How do we know that's our man?

14:08.410 --> 14:09.909
He's been ranting about the senator

14:09.910 --> 14:11.449
since two days before the summit.

14:11.450 --> 14:12.500
Here, look.

14:13.740 --> 14:15.699
"Senator Warren is not our friend.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.019
He is a Moskali dog who
deserves to suffer."

14:18.020 --> 14:19.279
It's the same word the kidnappers used.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.319
When was this posted?

14:20.320 --> 14:21.600
The day before the kidnapping.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.800
Looks like he's still posting them.

14:22.810 --> 14:26.449
Yes, but lucky for us, Serge
isn't hip to the dangers

14:26.450 --> 14:28.400
of social media tracking,
so I was able to map

14:28.410 --> 14:30.910
his whereabouts during
his last eight postings.

14:31.730 --> 14:34.010
That's near the alley where Anna was taken.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.869
Posted just minutes after.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.340
15 minutes earlier, he was
about a dozen blocks away.

14:39.230 --> 14:41.080
Which means he wasn't following her.

14:42.030 --> 14:44.700
He knew exactly when and
where she was gonna be.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.549
So this lunatic kidnapped
Anna because I happened

14:48.550 --> 14:50.990
to support the lifting
of Russian sanctions?

14:51.340 --> 14:52.619
It appears that way.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.009
But you're close to finding him?

14:54.010 --> 14:55.510
My people are on it.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.209
In the meantime, is it
possible that someone

14:59.210 --> 15:02.059
inside your office could be
working with the kidnapper?

15:02.060 --> 15:02.970
No, of course not.

15:02.971 --> 15:04.989
My staff are loyal.
They've all been vetted.

15:04.990 --> 15:07.059
Your wife was kidnapped in broad daylight

15:07.060 --> 15:08.640
in an alleyway off a busy street.

15:08.650 --> 15:11.150
The person who did this knew her schedule.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.610
They knew when and where to take her.

15:16.150 --> 15:19.790
Christina, I appreciate how
good you are at your job.

15:19.860 --> 15:20.920
And I'm sure in your line of work

15:20.930 --> 15:22.779
it's difficult to trust people.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.990
But nobody on my team would
ever put Anna in any danger.

15:26.370 --> 15:27.370
Ever.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.659
So, our genius kidnapper
used his credit card

15:32.660 --> 15:35.189
to rent a black Mercedes from the airport.

15:35.190 --> 15:38.779
So, how are things with you
and, uh, Captain America?

15:38.780 --> 15:39.960
You mean Mills?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.639
We're fine. Why?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.269
No, I just, uh, you know,

15:44.270 --> 15:45.569
he's got a bit of a reputation.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.260
You know, doesn't play well with others.

15:47.270 --> 15:50.039
But from what I've managed to
dig up, neither do you, so...

15:50.040 --> 15:51.589
Well, I think I can handle myself.

15:51.590 --> 15:52.749
Oh, I'm sure you can.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.779
Just, you know, SF's a different breed.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.269
You know that during the Cold War,

15:57.270 --> 16:00.319
they used to practice
parachuting by strapping

16:00.320 --> 16:02.570
nukes to their, uh, baby makers?

16:02.750 --> 16:05.049
That's fascinating. What is your point?

16:05.050 --> 16:07.489
Yeah, no, it's just guys
like Mills are trained

16:07.490 --> 16:08.679
not to see risk, you know?

16:08.680 --> 16:11.530
I hate for you to get
caught in the crossfire.

16:11.540 --> 16:14.229
It's like my, uh, my old boss
the Dalai Lama used to say.

16:14.230 --> 16:15.859
No, you did not work for the Dalai Lama.

16:15.860 --> 16:18.440
Hmm, nice guy. Likes to fix watches.

16:18.490 --> 16:19.639
You're not gonna believe this.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.079
That he likes to fix watches, no.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.650
Serge just posted.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.480
I have his location.

16:25.590 --> 16:27.079
It's a foreclosed farm house.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.010
Nearest neighbor's a quarter mile away.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.410
Perfect place to stash a hostage.

16:34.340 --> 16:35.340
So...

16:36.710 --> 16:37.930
How do you wanna play it?

16:38.260 --> 16:40.770
Well, I could gun it. Blow
through the front door.

16:40.860 --> 16:41.930
Sounds good to me.

16:42.780 --> 16:43.840
I was kidding.

16:45.750 --> 16:46.750
Let's go.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
Stop!

18:42.530 --> 18:43.750
Anna Warren?

18:43.890 --> 18:45.560
My name is Bryan Mills.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.440
I'm here to take you home.

18:48.870 --> 18:49.870
You're safe.

18:56.810 --> 18:58.829
What's this? Another protest?

18:58.830 --> 19:00.040
We'll go in the back.

19:00.150 --> 19:01.750
Use the service entrance.

19:03.090 --> 19:04.090
Mitchell.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.990
- Mitchell?
- Oh, honey.

19:09.770 --> 19:11.160
I'm so glad you're okay.

19:13.510 --> 19:14.660
What did they do to you?

19:14.670 --> 19:17.170
No, I'm all right.

19:18.860 --> 19:21.040
It is all thanks to this man.

19:23.570 --> 19:26.390
Words cannot express my gratitude.

19:26.530 --> 19:27.590
There's no need.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.199
What's with all the press outside?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.800
Rumors of Anna's kidnapping made the news.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.750
- A leak?
- Well, that doesn't matter.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.699
Now that she's back, I'll
just release a statement

19:38.700 --> 19:40.170
denying the whole thing.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.010
Oh, Mitchell.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.220
Are you sure you wanna do that?

19:46.450 --> 19:48.439
I am not gonna let the press
put you through the ringer.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.310
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

19:50.620 --> 19:51.890
I'm fine.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.649
But if you deny the kidnapping,

19:55.650 --> 19:59.730
you risk tarnishing your reputation
as an honest politician.

20:02.450 --> 20:03.950
What do you suggest?

20:06.960 --> 20:09.200
Well, for now, just say no comment.

20:10.970 --> 20:13.100
Let's let the rumors be what they are.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.609
You need to make the summit
your number one priority.

20:17.610 --> 20:20.010
The safest course of action

20:20.020 --> 20:22.109
is to fly you both back to the States.

20:22.110 --> 20:24.150
Not until after the reception.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.280
I'm hosting an event
tonight here at the hotel.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.419
Everybody from the summit will be there.

20:32.420 --> 20:34.970
It's our last chance to get
movement on a peace accord.

20:35.820 --> 20:37.489
It's our whole purpose for being here.

20:37.490 --> 20:40.389
Ma'am, you do realize that the
kidnapper is still out there?

20:40.390 --> 20:42.750
Luckily we've got you to protect us.

20:44.470 --> 20:47.380
What happened in Moscow was tragic.

20:47.930 --> 20:51.500
But I hate that our friendship
ended up as collateral damage.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.319
It was just easier for me

20:55.320 --> 20:58.430
to cut ties with anyone who
knew what had happened.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.050
Scorched earth.

21:01.670 --> 21:02.670
I understand.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.360
I just..

21:06.330 --> 21:07.690
I miss our talks.

21:08.770 --> 21:10.429
It's hard enough being a
woman in this business.

21:10.430 --> 21:12.509
It would be nice if I had
someone I could trust.

21:12.510 --> 21:14.310
You can still trust me, Brie.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.679
The CIA has a reason to believe

21:19.680 --> 21:21.160
that there's a Russian spy working

21:21.170 --> 21:22.930
in Senator Warren's campaign.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.610
So there is a mole.

21:24.810 --> 21:26.749
We think this person
leaked Anna's kidnapping

21:26.750 --> 21:28.759
in an attempt to make the
Ukrainians look bad.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.149
And take heat off the senator.

21:30.150 --> 21:32.579
If he's their source,
makes sense that the mole

21:32.580 --> 21:34.300
would try to protect him politically.

21:34.870 --> 21:36.570
So what do you want from us?

21:41.320 --> 21:43.730
You have access to the
senator's inner circle.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.490
I want you to help us smoke out that mole.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.879
So, outside of Warren,
only three people knew

21:50.880 --> 21:52.239
about the kidnapping.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.689
To find the mole, we need to determine

21:53.690 --> 21:56.300
each person's susceptibility
to recruitment.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.199
Theo Granger.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.789
Dishonorably discharged from the Army

22:00.790 --> 22:02.479
for striking a senior officer.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.189
Which makes him angry, but not a traitor.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.509
Joined Warren's staff in '06,

22:06.510 --> 22:08.019
but the senator pays him personally.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.960
According to his W2s, he
hasn't had a raise in years.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.360
So financially vulnerable.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.209
What about the campaign manager?

22:15.210 --> 22:16.470
Yeah, this guy.

22:16.930 --> 22:18.300
Michael Fortman.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.349
Your classic Ivy League fail upper.

22:20.350 --> 22:22.489
He graduated last in his
class at Dartmouth,

22:22.490 --> 22:24.450
but comes from a politically
connected family.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.700
He's worked on campaigns on
both sides of the aisle.

22:26.710 --> 22:28.200
The last two have been busts.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.370
So he can't afford to lose a third.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.810
Yeah, and he's got, uh, two DUls.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.239
Hmm, so alcohol. Another weakness.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.270
What about her?

22:37.340 --> 22:38.419
What about her?

22:38.420 --> 22:39.759
Beth Childers.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.949
Warren's assistant, and
my personal favorite.

22:41.950 --> 22:44.249
She dated a, uh, an employee
at the Russian embassy

22:44.250 --> 22:45.870
fisheries department for two years.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.059
They broke up online, but
they're still in touch.

22:48.060 --> 22:49.560
So why is she your favorite?

22:49.730 --> 22:52.099
'Cause she'll date a guy in
the fisheries department.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.400
Meaning there's hope for you?

22:54.210 --> 22:56.100
You know, Vera Wang does do cammo.

22:57.370 --> 22:59.040
Any luck nailing down our mole?

22:59.650 --> 23:01.869
Our best guess is one of these three.

23:01.870 --> 23:04.529
You know, a bunch of calls
were made to news agencies

23:04.530 --> 23:06.700
from the senator's private office.

23:07.550 --> 23:08.719
You two should go.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.470
We'll update you if we hear anything.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.099
I gotta say, for a woman
who just got kidnapped,

23:20.100 --> 23:21.540
she looks amazing.

23:21.940 --> 23:23.080
Check out those heels.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.190
You got a 20 on the campaign manager?

23:25.980 --> 23:27.270
Fortman's at the bar.

23:28.230 --> 23:31.650
That is his third Manhattan,
but who's counting?

23:31.680 --> 23:33.049
You, obviously.

23:33.050 --> 23:34.880
Hey, I notice things about people.

23:37.030 --> 23:38.969
Heads up. It's Hart.

23:38.970 --> 23:41.240
The hotel security footage came through.

23:41.810 --> 23:43.020
It's Fortman.

23:50.310 --> 23:51.460
You're coming with me.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.710
I'm not going anywhere.

23:56.350 --> 23:58.800
We know you leaked the story
of Anna's kidnapping.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.560
So what if I did?

24:03.690 --> 24:06.270
Look, it wasn't my idea.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.030
There's a lot going on
that you don't know about.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.990
I was under orders.

24:12.650 --> 24:13.780
Orders from who?

24:16.860 --> 24:17.860
He's been poisoned.

24:18.880 --> 24:19.930
Call an ambulance.

24:23.550 --> 24:25.610
Excusez moi. Excusez moi.

24:26.950 --> 24:28.210
Michael, stay with me.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.880
Look at me, look at me. Stay with me.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.949
Relax, relax, relax.

24:35.950 --> 24:37.289
Breathe. Michael, breathe.

24:37.290 --> 24:38.290
Give me some room.

24:41.530 --> 24:42.780
Hart's at the hospital.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.920
Campaign manager's in critical condition.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.120
What kind of poison?

24:46.630 --> 24:48.290
It was some kind of neurotoxin.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.860
Doctor says you saved his life.

24:49.970 --> 24:51.910
Charcoal neutralized most of the poison.

24:52.500 --> 24:55.410
Fortman admitted to leaking
Anna's kidnapping to the press.

24:55.550 --> 24:56.960
But he said he was under orders.

24:57.710 --> 24:58.710
By who?

24:59.170 --> 25:00.769
Well, maybe we're about to find out.

25:00.770 --> 25:01.880
You got a credit card?

25:09.160 --> 25:10.040
So, what are we looking for?

25:10.041 --> 25:12.600
Anything that might tell
us who he's working with.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.280
And voilид.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.140
Well, I don't think that
card will open a safe.

25:25.330 --> 25:26.659
You got a crowbar in there?

25:26.660 --> 25:27.700
Something better.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.610
Jet cord.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.780
Don't leave home without it.

26:02.050 --> 26:03.929
Shouldn't take too long to
search through this guy's data.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.070
And if there's anything
incriminating, we'll find it.

26:06.230 --> 26:07.860
I spoke with Brussels PD.

26:08.020 --> 26:10.969
Two kayakers found the body
of our Ukrainian kidnapper

26:10.970 --> 26:13.419
in the Yser river, Serge Ivonovich,

26:13.420 --> 26:14.789
shot in the back of the head.

26:14.790 --> 26:15.950
Professional hit.

26:16.430 --> 26:18.629
Prelim exam suggests the
body had been in the water

26:18.630 --> 26:20.319
a minimum of 72 hours.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.949
But that means that he was
dead before Anna was taken.

26:22.950 --> 26:24.689
Someone killed Serge and framed him

26:24.690 --> 26:25.769
for Anna's kidnapping.

26:25.770 --> 26:26.969
Yeah, well, it looks like before he died

26:26.970 --> 26:29.210
he sent the campaign manager an E-mail.

26:29.530 --> 26:30.530
What's that?

26:30.810 --> 26:33.050
It's a statement from Earthspring.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.100
The environmental charity?

26:35.210 --> 26:36.819
Yeah, it's a 501, actually,

26:36.820 --> 26:39.020
which means they don't have
to disclose their donors.

26:39.370 --> 26:40.489
Why is that important?

26:40.490 --> 26:42.309
Well, 'cause according to this statement,

26:42.310 --> 26:45.910
98% of Earthspring's funding
comes from Russian oligarchs.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.589
Earthspring is a big political donor

26:48.590 --> 26:50.099
to Senator Warren's campaign.

26:50.100 --> 26:53.419
So the fake news story about
his ties to Russia was true?

26:53.420 --> 26:55.449
Warren's been funneling
money to his campaign

26:55.450 --> 26:57.059
through a Russian-backed charity.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.659
And of the two people who knew that,

26:58.660 --> 27:01.050
one is dead and the other
is on life support.

27:02.390 --> 27:04.260
It's time to talk to the senator.

27:04.930 --> 27:07.370
Yes, Michael brought this to my attention.

27:07.820 --> 27:09.209
He claimed the author of this article

27:09.210 --> 27:11.339
gave it to him as proof his
allegations were true.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.789
So you had no idea that
Earthspring was funded

27:12.790 --> 27:14.069
by the Russians?

27:14.070 --> 27:14.490
No.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.319
And frankly, I still
find it hard to believe.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.409
Well, someone believed it
enough to poison Fortman

27:19.410 --> 27:20.949
and kill a Ukrainian separatist

27:20.950 --> 27:22.499
and frame him for Anna's kidnapping.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.289
But for what possible purpose?

27:24.290 --> 27:26.320
To discredit him and his entire story.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.489
By the way, have you seen
the latest poll numbers?

27:28.490 --> 27:29.949
It seems you're back in the lead.

27:29.950 --> 27:32.629
Are you insinuating that I
set up my wife's kidnapping

27:32.630 --> 27:34.060
to crush a story?

27:35.570 --> 27:36.989
You ever hear of charm school?

27:36.990 --> 27:38.549
It's a covert program in the '80s

27:38.550 --> 27:40.049
where Russian-born children were adopted

27:40.050 --> 27:42.319
by American families and used as spies.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.719
Where are you going with this?

27:43.720 --> 27:45.849
The CIA has proof that faked
intelligence provided

27:45.850 --> 27:47.709
to your office was leaked to the Russians.

27:47.710 --> 27:48.999
And you think I have something to do

27:49.000 --> 27:50.790
with this charm school?

27:51.430 --> 27:53.850
- Ridiculous.
- Well, you fit the profile.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.879
Adopted from overseas as a child,

27:55.880 --> 27:57.469
birth records conveniently lost.

27:57.470 --> 27:58.929
Your political position allows you access

27:58.930 --> 28:00.389
to classified secrets.

28:00.390 --> 28:02.559
And there's the Russian money
propping up your campaign.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.990
You sold out the country
that raised you, Senator.

28:05.130 --> 28:06.450
You're going to jail.

28:07.370 --> 28:08.950
I'm here to offer you a way out.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.450
You can flip sides.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.080
Work with us against the Russians.

28:12.230 --> 28:13.870
You think I'm a spy?

28:15.650 --> 28:17.419
I'm a decorated Marine!

28:17.420 --> 28:19.609
With a career dedicated
to serving my country.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.080
How dare you impugn my reputation?

28:24.420 --> 28:25.500
Hospital called.

28:25.540 --> 28:26.780
Fortman's out of danger.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.519
Should regain consciousness soon.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.560
Well, maybe now we'll finally
find out what really happened.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.210
Hold it right there.

28:53.620 --> 28:54.860
Step away from that...

29:32.220 --> 29:34.580
You might as well tell us who you are.

29:34.790 --> 29:37.450
'Cause, you know, we're gonna
find out soon enough anyway.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.100
And once we find out who you are,

29:40.270 --> 29:42.179
then you're gonna tell us who hired you

29:42.180 --> 29:43.640
to kidnap Anna Warren.

29:47.750 --> 29:48.879
Hey, I got a fingerprint match.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.669
His name is Vladmir Korchinko.

29:50.670 --> 29:52.359
He's former Russian FSB.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.769
Former FSB.

29:53.770 --> 29:55.460
Who do you work for now, Vlad?

29:56.660 --> 29:58.379
He's a private military contractor.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.019
Which we know is a cover for
the Kremlin Secret Police.

30:01.020 --> 30:01.840
You're gonna love this.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.529
Our friend Vlad here is a suspected member

30:03.530 --> 30:06.369
of a specialized squad
that killed 100 Ukrainian

30:06.370 --> 30:09.039
anti-government protestors back in 2014.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.810
I remember that story.

30:13.460 --> 30:17.090
Shooting unarmed civilians
from the safety of a rooftop.

30:17.660 --> 30:19.380
Did you get a medal for that, Vlad?

30:24.820 --> 30:27.570
I think it's time you met
some of my other friends.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.740
These guys have come a long way,

30:36.290 --> 30:38.210
so I suggest you be nice.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.170
I've been waiting a long time to meet you.

30:45.230 --> 30:48.699
Vladmir, I'm Christian,

30:48.700 --> 30:51.110
leader of the Red Hate resistance.

30:51.730 --> 30:53.540
I think you heard of us, hmm?

30:54.380 --> 30:57.450
You see, me and my comrades,

30:58.500 --> 31:00.230
we have a pledge.

31:00.310 --> 31:02.220
If we ever find and...

31:05.010 --> 31:06.689
Get our hands on the cowards

31:06.690 --> 31:10.920
who slaughtered our countrymen
that day in Kiev...

31:13.180 --> 31:14.669
We will not kill them.

31:14.670 --> 31:18.770
We will make them... suffer.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.629
An hour of terrible pain
for every single soul

31:26.630 --> 31:27.970
who died that day.

31:31.330 --> 31:32.769
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

31:32.770 --> 31:33.820
Give us a moment.

31:38.350 --> 31:41.600
So, who ordered you to kidnap Anna Warren?

31:42.940 --> 31:44.520
You don't understand.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.980
Anna was never kidnapped.

31:47.710 --> 31:48.640
What do you mean?

31:48.641 --> 31:51.900
I'm saying you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

31:51.970 --> 31:54.000
The person that you think is Anna...

31:55.670 --> 31:56.870
Doesn't exist.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.159
Natalia Likeshenka is the greatest patriot

32:01.160 --> 32:03.130
that Russia has ever produced.

32:03.820 --> 32:07.020
She was sent to America
as a child with one goal.

32:07.670 --> 32:09.170
To spy for Russia.

32:09.890 --> 32:11.840
She may seem like she's one of you,

32:12.020 --> 32:14.310
but she's actually one of us.

32:14.910 --> 32:18.100
People like Anna, men tell her things.

32:18.330 --> 32:20.160
But she has everyone fooled.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.860
Her husband, his staff,

32:22.870 --> 32:25.290
their friends, you.

32:25.710 --> 32:26.990
She's ruthless.

32:27.970 --> 32:31.070
She's not gonna let
anything stand in her way.

32:34.470 --> 32:37.660
But my failure to kill
Fortman has exposed her.

32:40.330 --> 32:44.010
She has no choice but to disappear.

32:45.470 --> 32:47.070
Like a puff of smoke.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.799
- Hello?
- It's Mills.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.800
Find Anna.

32:55.420 --> 32:56.559
Don't let her out of your sight.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.290
- What? Why?
- Just do it.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.250
Are we square?

33:02.740 --> 33:05.380
Wait. We made the deal?

33:05.650 --> 33:06.980
That's impossible.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.640
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.410
I was only following orders.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.430
Please.

33:23.150 --> 33:24.320
There you are.

33:37.460 --> 33:38.640
How's Senator Warren?

33:39.130 --> 33:41.439
Still groggy. Physically fine.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.120
One of my team is with him now.

33:43.470 --> 33:45.559
Just got word the bodyguard, Theo,

33:45.560 --> 33:47.180
died on the way to the hospital.

33:48.510 --> 33:50.999
And we still have no idea
where Anna might be headed?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.759
I've got more case officers at the airport

33:52.760 --> 33:55.269
and the train station, but
considering her skill set,

33:55.270 --> 33:56.519
she's probably already gone.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.540
Taking the secrets of
charm school with her.

33:58.550 --> 34:01.210
And the identities of who knows
how many deep cover spies.

34:02.530 --> 34:04.180
Gotta admit, I'm impressed.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.139
Fooling a bunch of outsiders is one thing.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.380
How did she manage to
hoodwink her own husband?

34:08.780 --> 34:10.250
Well, love is blind.

34:10.650 --> 34:12.799
You always believe the
best about the person

34:12.800 --> 34:14.170
sleeping next to you.

34:14.860 --> 34:15.670
Excuse me.

34:15.670 --> 34:17.400
The senator says he's leaving now.

34:20.830 --> 34:22.949
Whatever we forget, we can send for.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.509
I know this is difficult, Senator,

34:28.510 --> 34:31.500
but did Anna ever mention any friends?

34:32.219 --> 34:33.850
Or a favorite city?

34:35.639 --> 34:37.146
Something that might help us find her.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.530
What does it matter?

34:39.080 --> 34:41.100
Everything she ever told me was a lie.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.139
What do I tell my son?

34:47.980 --> 34:50.688
That his stepmother... a
woman he came to love

34:50.690 --> 34:54.500
probably more than me...
Was a Russian spy...

34:55.590 --> 34:57.560
Who only pretended to care about us?

34:58.360 --> 34:59.400
Senator,

35:00.640 --> 35:02.059
I've spoken to the director.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.029
He says he's going to do everything he can

35:04.030 --> 35:05.189
to help you get through this.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.750
I'm sorry, I have to go.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.990
I feel for the guy.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.680
I don't know how you get
over a betrayal like that.

35:24.820 --> 35:25.820
You don't.

35:32.090 --> 35:34.140
First it feels like you're suffocating.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.260
And then you just wanna
crawl into a hole and die.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.069
Over time the pain fades.

35:42.070 --> 35:43.070
You just...

35:44.530 --> 35:45.870
Pick up the pieces.

35:47.650 --> 35:48.870
Life goes on.

35:49.870 --> 35:51.280
But you never really...

35:53.280 --> 35:56.350
truly trust again, not like you did before.

35:57.150 --> 35:58.150
Who was he?

36:02.350 --> 36:04.690
Someone I worked with in Moscow.

36:07.510 --> 36:09.700
His betrayal nearly crushed me.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.759
It certainly torpedoed my career

36:13.760 --> 36:15.870
and got my best asset arrested.

36:16.610 --> 36:17.700
Arrested?

36:19.390 --> 36:20.720
Or executed?

36:26.400 --> 36:27.400
Yeah.

36:58.950 --> 36:59.950
You see anything?

37:00.580 --> 37:01.580
Not yet.

37:17.090 --> 37:19.100
Wait. Six o'clock, pink scarf.

37:26.470 --> 37:27.470
My mistake.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.560
Sorry.

37:30.820 --> 37:31.860
It wasn't her.

37:36.610 --> 37:38.780
- They're getting aboard.
- She's a pro.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.099
She probably changed her
appearance already.

37:40.100 --> 37:40.870
Died her hair.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.810
How are we ever gonna identify her?

37:49.270 --> 37:50.420
They weren't in her closet.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
What?

37:54.090 --> 37:55.860
Red shoes. They weren't in her closet.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.340
Champaign.

38:20.350 --> 38:22.380
Seems a little early to be celebrating.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.650
How did you find me?

38:26.300 --> 38:28.060
Dimenhydrinate.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.140
For motion sickness.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.970
Figured someone might
be taking a boat ride.

38:34.130 --> 38:36.170
I have a delicate stomach.

38:36.740 --> 38:38.180
Never would have guessed.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.449
So what happens now?

38:42.450 --> 38:43.990
That's up to the CIA.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.840
You've already killed at least three men,

38:46.920 --> 38:48.440
who knows how many others.

38:49.290 --> 38:50.800
My guess is you're going away.

38:52.650 --> 38:53.850
You fool.

38:54.390 --> 38:56.520
All I have to do is scream.

38:56.810 --> 38:57.850
Then scream.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.190
Too much Champaign.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.650
Anna was the strongest woman I ever knew.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.870
So I wasn't surprised when
she asked that her illness

39:18.960 --> 39:20.110
be kept private.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.369
And there it is.

39:21.370 --> 39:24.210
Another lie foisted upon
the unsuspecting public.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.570
Anna's not dead.

39:25.950 --> 39:27.189
CIA's trading her to the Russians

39:27.190 --> 39:28.790
for two American operatives.

39:29.020 --> 39:32.230
She collapsed on our
flight home from Brussels.

39:33.190 --> 39:35.860
Heroic attempts were made
to revive her, but...

39:36.350 --> 39:37.639
You know, I feel bad for the kid.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.639
His first mom dies, second mom's a spy.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.819
First mom was murdered, you mean.

39:40.820 --> 39:41.800
Probably poisoned.

39:41.801 --> 39:43.199
That's Anna's signature move.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.060
Needless to say, Brett
and I are devastated.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.580
And there are some people who
think I should step down.

39:51.300 --> 39:53.140
But Brett and I talked it over.

39:54.980 --> 39:58.160
And we feel the best way
to honor Anna's memory

39:59.230 --> 40:01.010
is for me to stay in the race.

40:03.670 --> 40:04.730
Thank you.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.059
I mean, there's proof right there

40:06.060 --> 40:07.439
that the news is just an echo chamber

40:07.440 --> 40:09.499
delivered by an algorithm on social media.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.170
I mean, soon the entire
world is gonna be run

40:11.180 --> 40:13.870
by a handful of semi
imperial nation states.

40:14.140 --> 40:14.940
Yeah.

40:14.941 --> 40:16.019
You know what I really love about you?

40:16.020 --> 40:17.049
- What's that?
- How you always see

40:17.050 --> 40:19.150
- the bright side of things.
- Mmm, thanks.

40:26.790 --> 40:28.470
We've been monitoring Brett's phone.

40:30.260 --> 40:31.689
Russian's a little rusty.

40:31.690 --> 40:32.760
What does it say?

40:32.900 --> 40:35.080
"I'm proud of you. Love, A."

40:37.180 --> 40:38.430
What did he text back?

40:40.360 --> 40:41.450
"Miss you."

40:43.530 --> 40:44.830
Seems harmless enough.

40:44.950 --> 40:46.540
Yeah, till it isn't.

40:48.060 --> 40:49.669
How did you know she'd contact him?

40:49.670 --> 40:51.150
Something Warren said,

40:51.290 --> 40:53.280
about how much Brett loved Anna.

40:53.590 --> 40:56.000
So what do we do? Arrest Brett?

40:58.450 --> 40:59.590
We watch.

40:59.670 --> 41:00.810
And we wait.

41:01.380 --> 41:03.139
Eventually the Russians
may try to activate him.

41:03.140 --> 41:05.090
Maybe in five years, maybe in ten.

41:05.100 --> 41:08.989
But when they do, we'll be one step ahead.

41:08.990 --> 41:11.650
That's a long time to do nothing.

41:13.150 --> 41:14.690
Welcome to the spy game.

41:15.305 --> 41:21.862
