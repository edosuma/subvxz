WEBVTT

00:13.192 --> 00:13.922
Done!

00:13.922 --> 00:15.642
In your face, bush!

00:16.952 --> 00:18.762
Looks like you've got a ways to go there, guy!

00:18.762 --> 00:20.892
Not as much as Muscle Man over there.

00:20.892 --> 00:22.582
He barely touched that hedge.

00:27.932 --> 00:30.502
Hey, Muscle Man, we got work to do, remember?

00:31.292 --> 00:33.112
Dude, are you crying?

00:33.462 --> 00:34.232
No!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.882
Crying's for ladies! Like you!

00:36.952 --> 00:38.392
I don't cry!

00:44.172 --> 00:46.322
Dude, he's been in there for hours.

00:46.322 --> 00:48.232
Muscle Man. Muscle Man!

00:49.722 --> 00:52.692
Muscle Man, are you taking a shower so we can't see you crying?

00:52.832 --> 00:54.352
No! It's...

00:54.522 --> 00:57.902
it's just the sound of the water hitting the drain.

00:57.942 --> 00:59.512
Dude, what's wrong with him?

00:59.512 --> 01:02.262
His girlfriend, Starla dumped him last night.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.852
What? Muscle Man had a girlfriend?

01:04.861 --> 01:06.682
I wonder who had more junk in the trunk.

01:06.682 --> 01:08.032
Muscle Man, just come out.

01:08.032 --> 01:09.562
We can talk about it if you want.

01:09.562 --> 01:10.442
No!

01:10.452 --> 01:13.742
I don't talk about my feelings with anyone!

01:13.882 --> 01:15.832
Leave me alone!

01:16.082 --> 01:18.572
No use, man. Let's let Benson deal with him.

01:19.242 --> 01:22.192
So it's come to my attention that Muscle Man's been dumped.

01:22.322 --> 01:25.602
He can't do his job because, I don't know, he's sad or something.

01:25.902 --> 01:26.712
So guess what?

01:26.712 --> 01:29.312
You two clowns are gonna pick up his work for today!

01:29.362 --> 01:31.822
Aw, what? I'm always sad.

01:31.822 --> 01:32.972
I'm sad right now.

01:33.002 --> 01:34.272
Can we get time off too?

01:34.272 --> 01:36.392
File a request with human resources.

01:36.532 --> 01:38.822
- OK, who's the HR guy? - Me.

01:38.992 --> 01:40.582
So... can we?

01:40.702 --> 01:41.682
No.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.832
OK, let's see what we got here...

01:43.892 --> 01:45.102
Task Number One:

01:45.102 --> 01:47.672
Dig out the rotting stumps from the picnic area.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.142
Watch out for hornets' nests.

01:49.822 --> 01:50.752
Task Number Two:

01:50.752 --> 01:52.692
that guy who thinks he's a knight is back.

01:52.692 --> 01:55.372
He's built a castle out of old mattresses at the creek.

01:55.372 --> 01:56.482
Get him out of there!

01:56.932 --> 01:57.982
And finally,

01:57.992 --> 02:00.522
there's the daily maintenance of the park rock garden.

02:00.702 --> 02:02.382
This is impossible!

02:02.382 --> 02:05.362
Who knew Muscle Man was responsible for so much stuff?

02:05.452 --> 02:07.392
We gotta convince him to start working again.

02:07.542 --> 02:09.622
Yeah! Why should we do his work?

02:09.622 --> 02:10.982
Alright, let's do it.

02:11.552 --> 02:12.982
I won't miss this job.

02:12.982 --> 02:14.412
Raking that sand took...

02:15.682 --> 02:18.522
Nooooo!

02:19.752 --> 02:21.622
Dude, you gotta snap out of it.

02:21.622 --> 02:23.652
Benson is making us do all your work!

02:23.652 --> 02:24.942
I can't work.

02:24.992 --> 02:27.772
I'm busy stuffing my face hole!

02:28.452 --> 02:30.892
Look, I know you're upset, but you gotta move on.

02:30.892 --> 02:32.392
I'm not upset!

02:32.402 --> 02:33.982
I'm... I'm...

02:41.732 --> 02:43.812
Come on, dude. There's plenty of fish in the sea.

02:45.982 --> 02:47.082
Alright, Muscle Man.

02:47.082 --> 02:49.442
Grocery stores have tons of available women.

02:49.522 --> 02:51.062
I don't know, Mordecai.

02:51.062 --> 02:53.682
None of these ladies are as hot as Starla.

02:53.732 --> 02:55.942
Dude, man up! Check this out.

02:56.122 --> 02:57.542
That girl is single.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.912
How can you tell?

02:58.912 --> 02:59.832
Check out her cart.

02:59.852 --> 03:02.702
American cheese singles, a single serving of soup,

03:02.722 --> 03:04.602
and who buys one banana?

03:04.602 --> 03:06.212
And I don't see a ring on that finger.

03:06.312 --> 03:08.292
So what are you waiting for? Go get her!

03:08.642 --> 03:11.192
Uh, hey, you're a chick.

03:11.312 --> 03:13.502
I was wondering if you wanted to...

03:15.792 --> 03:17.352
I can't do this!

03:17.582 --> 03:20.542
This heart beats for another!

03:22.002 --> 03:24.692
Starlaaaaa!

03:27.282 --> 03:29.332
Muscle Man. Muscle Man!

03:29.522 --> 03:30.962
He's never going to come out.

03:30.992 --> 03:32.372
There's no way we can help him.

03:32.372 --> 03:33.802
There is one way.

03:34.472 --> 03:37.042
We gotta get him back together with Starla.

03:41.282 --> 03:43.432
You sure this is where she works?

03:47.262 --> 03:49.892
Everything is all glittery and girl-

03:58.722 --> 04:00.722
Can I help you gentlemen?

04:01.642 --> 04:04.512
Do you know a guy by the name of Muscle Man?

04:04.562 --> 04:06.802
- Big guy, 'bout your build? - Yeah.

04:06.802 --> 04:09.502
I know him. I dumped that loser.

04:09.572 --> 04:12.162
Yeah, well, he's pretty miserable without you.

04:12.172 --> 04:13.932
You should give him another chance.

04:14.642 --> 04:16.622
I'm not getting back together with him.

04:16.622 --> 04:17.772
That's over now.

04:19.502 --> 04:20.232
Look,

04:20.432 --> 04:22.252
I know how Muscle Man can be.

04:22.252 --> 04:24.232
He's annoying, he smells,

04:24.232 --> 04:26.742
and he pretty much has no common decency for others,

04:26.742 --> 04:29.392
but he's still human, and he has feelings.

04:29.392 --> 04:30.372
We all do.

04:30.402 --> 04:33.612
We're just fragile beings looking for someone to share something with.

04:33.682 --> 04:35.842
To laugh with. To love.

04:45.112 --> 04:47.642
...and that's why I think you should get back together with Muscle Man.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.372
Well, I guess we'll be going.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.232
Wait!

04:50.792 --> 04:51.602
You!

04:51.712 --> 04:54.022
Wait! You! You had such a way with words!

04:54.072 --> 04:56.682
Muscle Man never talked to me that way.

04:56.782 --> 04:59.192
He didn't like talking about his feelings.

04:59.272 --> 05:02.532
But you? You're different.

05:03.312 --> 05:05.112
Will you excuse us for a minute?

05:06.042 --> 05:07.422
Aw, sick!

05:08.712 --> 05:10.662
She liked you, she liked you!

05:10.662 --> 05:11.452
Dude, shut up!

05:11.522 --> 05:13.492
Dude, you should totally go out with her!

05:13.492 --> 05:15.292
What? Are you serious?

05:15.292 --> 05:17.712
I'd rather do Muscle Man's work than date her.

05:17.712 --> 05:20.112
Dude, if you just play along with it, you can dump her.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.112
Then, she'll go running back to Muscle Man for sure.

05:22.782 --> 05:24.462
Alright, one date.

05:27.752 --> 05:30.622
Better make it three or four just to make sure the dumping takes full effect.

05:31.202 --> 05:32.102
Fine.

05:34.712 --> 05:37.052
Do you wanna, um, you know,

05:37.882 --> 05:39.372
go...out?

05:39.372 --> 05:40.092
Yes!

06:20.952 --> 06:22.202
Dude, did you dump her yet?

06:22.202 --> 06:23.002
No.

06:23.002 --> 06:25.172
Come on, man! Get it over with!

06:25.172 --> 06:27.932
I don't wanna do Muscle Man's work anymore. I'm exhausted!

06:27.932 --> 06:30.202
I know, I know. I'll dump her.

06:35.152 --> 06:36.792
Look, we gotta talk.

06:37.062 --> 06:39.932
You got some pie on your lip. I'll get it off!

06:42.142 --> 06:43.462
Augh, get offa me!

06:43.462 --> 06:45.212
What's wrong, dumplin'?

06:45.212 --> 06:46.922
I'll tell you what's wrong.

06:46.912 --> 06:49.602
I don't like you.

06:54.912 --> 06:57.062
I don't think we should see each other anymore.

07:01.232 --> 07:02.692
- Dumped? - Dumped.

07:02.702 --> 07:03.602
How'd she take it?

07:03.612 --> 07:05.192
Mmm, she took it well.

07:21.792 --> 07:23.712
Come on! Come on, c'mon!

07:25.652 --> 07:27.212
Go! Go! Go!

07:31.212 --> 07:32.052
Hold on!

07:33.712 --> 07:36.222
Yeah, we did it! She just got tr-rashed!

07:37.652 --> 07:38.782
Oh no!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.232
Go faster! Let's go faster! Step on it!

08:13.002 --> 08:13.802
Look out!

08:22.302 --> 08:23.892
We're live at the park,

08:23.892 --> 08:26.872
where reports of a crazed woman on a rampage...

08:32.082 --> 08:33.312
Muscle Man!

08:33.312 --> 08:35.812
Your ex's gone crazy and she's wrecking up the park!

08:36.402 --> 08:38.121
Dude, you have to talk to her!

08:48.192 --> 08:49.152
Starla?

08:56.552 --> 08:58.072
I guess this is it.

09:02.872 --> 09:04.192
Mordecai!

09:05.222 --> 09:06.042
Babe!

09:06.692 --> 09:09.292
I can't stand to see you like this.

09:09.362 --> 09:10.542
You gotta stop!

09:14.472 --> 09:16.352
I guess I'll just go.

09:16.422 --> 09:19.362
Dude, Muscle Man! She's right there!

09:19.462 --> 09:21.142
Say something to her!

09:22.732 --> 09:25.592
I think you're foxy when you break things.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.672
No! From here.

09:31.122 --> 09:32.122
Starla?

09:33.372 --> 09:35.562
I can understand you're upset.

09:35.762 --> 09:38.812
When I look at you, I think of someone I know.

09:38.902 --> 09:42.712
Someone who is fragile and vulnerable deep down.

09:43.012 --> 09:45.132
Someone who has feelings.

09:45.132 --> 09:47.002
That someone is me.

09:47.232 --> 09:48.962
Mitch Sorenstein.

09:50.272 --> 09:52.092
His name's Mitch?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.562
I've been so upset since you left me, baby.

09:54.702 --> 09:56.442
You're the light of my life.

09:56.442 --> 09:58.662
The fire that burns in my heart.

09:58.702 --> 09:59.462
The one.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.722
Starla.

10:02.372 --> 10:04.282
Will you be my Muscle Woman?

10:04.852 --> 10:05.772
Mitch...?

10:06.562 --> 10:10.222
- Mitch! - Starla!

10:10.222 --> 10:15.342
- Miiiiitch! - Staaaarlaaaa!

10:22.142 --> 10:24.152
Aw, sick!

10:24.152 --> 10:25.542
Aw, Mitch!

10:25.782 --> 10:29.552
I've never heard you talk about your feelings before!

10:29.552 --> 10:33.642
You know who else doesn't like to talk about her feelings?

10:33.992 --> 10:35.712
My Mom!

10:37.192 --> 10:40.572
Oh, Mitch! You have the best sense of humor.

10:42.492 --> 10:44.212
Aw yeah, baby.

10:44.212 --> 10:47.212
You know I love it when you destroy property.

10:49.722 --> 10:51.672
As much as I wanna vomit right now,

10:51.802 --> 10:53.672
those two were made for one another.

10:54.312 --> 10:56.362
This was the most disturbing day of my life.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.872
Yeah. Maybe we should have just done Muscle Man's chores.
