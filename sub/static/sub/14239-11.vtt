WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:04.604
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:04.639 --> 00:07.325
Torchwood, outside the Government,
beyond the police.

00:07.360 --> 00:11.719
Tracking down Alien life on earth and
arming the human race against the future.

00:11.754 --> 00:14.196
The 21st century
is when everything changes

00:14.231 --> 00:16.604
and you've got to be ready.
Diane Holmes.

00:16.639 --> 00:19.880
How have you done this to me?
Love, you're always at its mercy.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.880
Hate to break it to you,
but you're not my first.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.600
Anti-Weevil spray.

00:48.635 --> 00:50.404
Handclamps.

00:50.439 --> 00:55.399
Come on,
let's make this easy for both of us.

01:03.119 --> 01:05.564
This always happens
when I give them the night off.

01:05.599 --> 01:11.879
It's not even really medium, let
alone well done. French places, see.

01:11.914 --> 01:16.496
Remember that weekend in Paris,
the place with the wood panelling -

01:16.531 --> 01:21.079
they'd barely even waved the steak
under the grill and you said...

01:21.114 --> 01:24.040
Why are you looking at me like that?
Sorry, like what?

01:24.075 --> 01:27.525
Like you'd rather be somewhere else!

01:27.560 --> 01:32.760
It's becoming the norm, in't it? I'm chopsing
away and I look up and you're just absent.

01:32.795 --> 01:36.160
What's happening to us, Gwen?
I know. I'm sorry.

01:36.195 --> 01:38.760
Is it something I've done?

01:38.795 --> 01:41.160
Or not done?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.519
What the hell was that?

01:54.360 --> 01:57.925
Oh, God, what's happened to you?
Rhys, is it? Nice to meet you!

01:57.960 --> 02:00.840
Sorry, it's an emergency, I'll
have her back for dessert. Come on...

02:00.875 --> 02:03.720
Hold on, that's my girlfriend.
Rhys, this is Jack. Sit down, Gwen.

02:03.755 --> 02:05.999
He's my boss. Sit the fuck down!

02:08.239 --> 02:10.759
Don't ever speak to me like that.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.404
Come on, Gwen. Let's go.

02:14.439 --> 02:16.759
Hey, she's with me tonight.
One night off. You promised.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.165
Don't you dare.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.319
If you go now, Gwen...!

02:31.360 --> 02:34.760
Sorry for cutting in, but I've
been having trouble with this one.

02:34.795 --> 02:37.437
Rhys will get over it.
He always does.

02:37.472 --> 02:40.079
You promised
you'd keep hold of your life.

02:40.114 --> 02:42.360
Don't let it drift.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.285
WATCH BEEPS

02:44.320 --> 02:47.239
300 metres on the right, car park!

03:08.079 --> 03:09.600
Jack! Over there!

03:18.799 --> 03:21.479
Get him in, get him in!

03:21.514 --> 03:24.160
They're fucking mad! Hey!

03:37.679 --> 03:39.480
Who the hell were they?!

03:49.560 --> 03:52.364
One - since when did other
people know about Weevils?

03:52.399 --> 03:55.800
Two - have they done this before and
if so why didn't we know about it?

03:55.835 --> 03:58.124
Three -
what do they want with them anyway?

03:58.159 --> 04:03.760
Might not be connected, but we've noticed a surge
of unusual injuries being reported at the A&E unit.

04:03.795 --> 04:09.079
Chunks taken out of legs and arms,
deep wounds to backs and stomachs.

04:09.114 --> 04:12.136
So we have a wave of Weevil
attacks to add to our problems.

04:12.171 --> 04:15.645
And by the way, that spray
we've used on them previously?

04:15.680 --> 04:19.119
They're becoming immune to it.
They're mutating? Or evolving.

04:19.154 --> 04:21.483
So any sign of the one
we lost earlier?

04:21.519 --> 04:23.859
I've run a trace on the van's
number plate... it's fake.

04:23.894 --> 04:26.866
2,500 vans of that type
registered in the Cardiff area.

04:26.901 --> 04:29.650
Widen that to a forty mile
radius and the number doubles.

04:29.685 --> 04:32.364
So, run a trace on the vehicle.
Route via traffic cameras?

04:32.399 --> 04:37.199
This is Owen's voice mail, leave a
message if you must. Processing now.

04:37.234 --> 04:39.360
Leave a message for Gwen and Rhys,
and we'll call you back...

04:39.395 --> 04:41.764
if we remember... oi!

04:41.799 --> 04:44.999
Hi, it's me.
I've left three messages now.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.200
Look, I've got dozens
of excuses, em...

04:48.235 --> 04:50.245
.. hundreds. Thousands!

04:50.280 --> 04:52.285
But none of them good enough.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.080
Things have got away
from me a bit lately.

04:55.115 --> 04:58.844
It's this job - it never lets up.

04:58.879 --> 05:02.400
Look, I'll see you later.
I'm not sure what time yet.

05:02.435 --> 05:05.080
I've got some work
to finish off first.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.080
Call me.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.520
Message deleted.

05:17.440 --> 05:23.965
MOBILE RINGS

05:24.000 --> 05:26.279
Are you going to answer that?
Ninth missed call - work.

05:26.314 --> 05:28.079
Do you enjoy your job then?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.799
Look, if you don't mind...
I came out to be alone.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.616
Ah, the old Greta Garbo.

05:35.651 --> 05:37.364
Something like that.

05:37.399 --> 05:41.280
Little bit of advice -
next time you feel like this,

05:41.315 --> 05:43.604
you should stay in.

05:43.639 --> 05:45.919
Trust me, the bigger the crowd,
the more alone I feel.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.725
I said - no chatting up the punters.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.764
Tommy, I work in a bar.
It's my job to speak to them.

05:50.799 --> 05:54.419
You're never happier than when you're
flashing your tits at a dickhead.

05:54.454 --> 05:58.039
Don't talk to her like that. You
what? We were having a conversation.

05:58.074 --> 06:01.560
When you grown up, you'll realise
that's what human beings do.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.520
Tommy, stop. You'll get me the sack!

06:07.519 --> 06:11.359
It's about using your opponent's
aggression to your own ends.

06:11.394 --> 06:15.759
Now, I'd suggest you don't
pick fights with strangers.

06:15.794 --> 06:19.204
And you should really
upgrade your boyfriend.

06:19.239 --> 06:21.880
What does a man have to do
to get some peace in this city?

06:26.680 --> 06:31.439
MOBILE RINGS

06:42.040 --> 06:44.405
Owen's still not answering
his phone. he's been even more

06:44.440 --> 06:48.160
erratic than usual since that
thing with Diane. Since the what?

06:48.195 --> 06:51.520
It's none of my business.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.960
What thing?

06:57.240 --> 06:59.900
What thing, Tosh?

06:59.935 --> 07:02.525
Owen and Diane.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.365
Before she took the plane,
they had a... thing.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.879
You knew that, right? Oh, yeah,
of course I knew that.

07:08.914 --> 07:12.360
I just didn't know
they had a thing...

07:12.395 --> 07:13.600
thing.

07:14.439 --> 07:17.719
It started ten minutes ago.

07:17.754 --> 07:19.805
WEEVIL HOWLS

07:19.840 --> 07:22.840
What d'you think it's doing?

07:25.399 --> 07:28.019
I think it's weeping. Why?

07:28.054 --> 07:30.604
Owen's been studying this one,

07:30.639 --> 07:36.840
thinks they have a low level of telepathic
ability to share emotion across distance.

07:36.875 --> 07:39.319
You mean it might be feeling
the pain of another Weevil?

07:39.354 --> 07:41.239
I kinda hope we're wrong, though.

07:41.274 --> 07:43.204
Why?

07:43.239 --> 07:47.559
Because that would mean somebody's
not only kidnapping Weevils,

07:49.360 --> 07:51.439
they're causing them pain.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.320
What can you feel?

08:15.400 --> 08:17.160
What do you know?

08:19.239 --> 08:24.480
I've tracked the van's route. It went
straight from the car park out to the docks.

08:24.515 --> 08:27.199
This was two hours ago.

08:34.599 --> 08:36.205
What happened?

08:36.240 --> 08:38.880
The CCTV cameras went down.
D'you think it was deliberate?

08:38.914 --> 08:42.080
I think these guys really
don't like to be watched.

08:42.115 --> 08:44.485
See, and I know it's
a character flaw...

08:44.520 --> 08:48.040
that makes me all the more determined
to find out what it is they're hiding.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.325
Looks like we missed them.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.600
Yeah, but if you quit places in
a hurry, you tend to be forgetful.

09:16.039 --> 09:18.520
Y'know what they used these
warehouses for during World War Two?

09:21.720 --> 09:25.085
Storing the bodies of dead Gls.

09:25.120 --> 09:28.440
Sometimes, you can know
too much history.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.000
DOOR CLANGS

09:34.080 --> 09:35.559
Come on.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.165
There's nothing here.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.920
So what were they doing here?

09:44.679 --> 09:46.799
Why come all this way out?

09:52.639 --> 09:56.539
What is it? Looks human.

09:56.574 --> 10:00.439
Male. Is he alive? Hello?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.120
You OK there?

10:05.359 --> 10:08.879
We're looking for the people
who were here last night!

10:08.914 --> 10:12.399
If you saw anything, now's
a good time to speak up.

10:12.434 --> 10:14.400
Jack, he's bleeding!

10:21.999 --> 10:23.605
Oh, my God! Weevil marks.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.600
You don't think it's still here?

10:25.635 --> 10:27.605
No. We'd hear it.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.039
Now help me with the body.
FUNNY RING TONE

10:30.074 --> 10:31.604
Is that his?

10:31.639 --> 10:34.080
You don't think
I'd choose that ring tone?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.319
Don't answer it.

10:44.119 --> 10:46.564
Hello? 'I don't know who you are.

10:46.599 --> 10:48.524
'Stay out of what
doesn't concern you. '

10:48.559 --> 10:51.164
Who killed this man?
'Did you hear what I just said?'

10:51.199 --> 10:55.320
I have this selective deafness when
I'm talking to cowards or murderers.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.240
'Don't interfere in things
you don't understand. '

10:58.275 --> 11:00.245
Oh, I understand
this better than you.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.820
Cos I know how this is going to end
- we're going to hunt you down.

11:03.855 --> 11:07.325
We're going to ensure that you're
punished for what happened here.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.479
And we're going to make you surrender that
creature that you kidnapped. Is that clear enough?

11:17.239 --> 11:22.039
lanto? I need you to trace all calls to
and from this number in the last 24 hours.

11:22.074 --> 11:24.319
Fast as you can.
We're on our way back.

11:24.354 --> 11:26.965
MOBILE RINGS

11:27.000 --> 11:29.885
This is Owen's voicemail.
Don't leave a message.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.005
Nice try, Owen. I want you
back at the Hub immediately.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.039
We've got a Weevil murder, so get
your boney little ass over here now.

11:38.239 --> 11:43.080
Dan Hodges, date of birth,
21st of January 1979.

11:43.115 --> 11:45.837
Salesman for web
publishing software.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.559
Looks like he was
married with a kid.

11:48.594 --> 11:50.444
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

11:50.479 --> 11:56.199
Right, definitely death by Weevil, but he took
a right kicking before the throat was punctured.

11:56.234 --> 11:59.485
Weevils go for the kill,
straight for the jugular.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.719
Look at his face - black eye,
bruises to the cheekbones.

12:02.754 --> 12:05.176
Same across the back and the ribs.

12:05.211 --> 12:07.564
Could he have been tortured? Maybe.

12:07.599 --> 12:10.805
But I reckon these wounds
were inflicted by humans.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.884
But why smack somebody about
and then set the Weevil on them?

12:14.919 --> 12:18.519
Why not get the Weevil do all the work
for you? Any joy with the phone records?

12:18.554 --> 12:22.119
The last incoming number was blocked.
The phone's call history has been erased.

12:22.154 --> 12:24.204
God, they move fast.

12:24.239 --> 12:27.680
You ask me, these guys are using
Weevils to carry out the perfect murder.

12:27.715 --> 12:31.560
No fingerprints, no traces
of recognisable DNA,...

12:31.595 --> 12:33.965
a quick, guaranteed death.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.445
Nothing to connect anyone
to the murder.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.125
Right. Should be a piece
of piss to find the killer, then.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.600
What about this guy? Someone's got to
break it to his wife that he's dead.

13:01.560 --> 13:06.880
The shittiest part about being a police
officer and I can't get away from it.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.884
Thanks for your kind words
of support.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.559
What d'you want me to say?
She'll be all right in the end?

13:20.160 --> 13:23.079
You can always count on Owen
to make you feel better.

13:27.399 --> 13:30.479
Tosh mentioned you and Diane...

13:30.514 --> 13:31.765
Did you...

13:31.800 --> 13:34.720
I didn't want her to go. She went.

13:36.879 --> 13:39.559
Why are we still
doing this, me and you?

13:43.599 --> 13:49.160
Fine. Let's not. I was getting
bored of your fuck-tricks, anyway.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.760
You can be such a wanker
sometimes, Owen, d'you know that?

13:51.795 --> 13:54.079
I do, as a matter of fact!

14:05.760 --> 14:07.600
Where the hell have you been?

14:07.635 --> 14:09.804
Walking.

14:09.839 --> 14:13.205
Well, in your absence,
Toshiko's had a great idea.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.399
Well, it had to happen sooner
or later. Ignore him, Tosh.

14:16.434 --> 14:18.325
Yeah, just ignore me, Tosh.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.325
I can be such a wanker. Apparently.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.960
The van went with the Weevil
straight to the warehouse.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.765
They must've known it was empty.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.079
Either they own it or had previous
contact with the estate agents.

14:28.114 --> 14:30.644
Owen Harper,
you're going into property.

14:30.679 --> 14:34.360
Toshiko's in the middle of fixing
you a cover story. Hang on, why me?

14:34.395 --> 14:36.999
Jack and Gwen were in the car park,
I was in the warehouse.

14:37.034 --> 14:39.564
If they've got access to CCTV,
they'll recognise us.

14:39.599 --> 14:41.760
We have to get under their guard,
find out what's going on.

14:41.795 --> 14:43.604
Yeah, all right.

14:43.639 --> 14:47.080
I could do with being
someone else right now.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.165
Mr Harper? Yeah. Mark Lynch.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.640
You're looking to relocate
your business to Cardiff? Yeah.

15:00.675 --> 15:02.359
And you export jellied eels. Really?

15:02.394 --> 15:04.044
Huge growth market.

15:04.079 --> 15:10.319
China, South America, I'm having a nightmare
trying to keep up with demand. I'll er...

15:10.354 --> 15:12.360
get you a batch if you find me
the right gaff.

15:12.395 --> 15:15.217
I think I'll pass on that.

15:15.252 --> 15:18.005
Any family to relocate?

15:18.040 --> 15:20.440
Just me. It's better that way.

15:21.999 --> 15:27.199
And you're looking for premises
out by the docks?

15:27.234 --> 15:31.157
Mmm, nice big warehouse,
that's what I need.

15:31.192 --> 15:35.080
I've got a couple
that should be perfect.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.759
Hang on while I print. Thanks.

15:51.919 --> 15:56.559
We're in! This'll give us everything on
his hard drive, including encrypted files.

15:56.594 --> 15:59.559
If I can establish a routing
protocol, whatever he does on

15:59.594 --> 16:02.760
this computer from now on,
we'll know about it.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.485
Owen, you're clear.

16:17.520 --> 16:22.959
These have got the square footage you're
looking for, good access, competitively priced...

16:22.994 --> 16:24.805
Except...

16:24.840 --> 16:27.439
these all look like shitholes to me.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.485
Yeah.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.405
They are a bit.

16:34.440 --> 16:39.520
Didn't I see your sign outside a big
place in the Q section of the docks?

16:39.555 --> 16:43.325
We've accepted an offer on it.
Pretty much signed and sealed.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.559
He's lying. According to their records,
it only went on the market last week.

16:47.594 --> 16:50.757
Bummer. What about a unit
on an industrial estate?

16:50.792 --> 16:53.885
Save a ton on rent, even
after transport costs.

16:53.920 --> 16:58.205
And you just happen to have
a list of suitable premises? Nah.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.159
There are other possibilities. You
free at the end of the day? Yeah.

17:02.194 --> 17:03.764
Go for a drink?

17:03.799 --> 17:06.119
On your own in a strange city.
I remember that feeling.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.405
And look at you now.

17:08.440 --> 17:13.160
Couple of gorgeous birds answering your phones
for you. If that's not success, I dunno what is!

17:13.194 --> 17:16.085
It's all bollocks, really.

17:16.119 --> 17:20.878
But, if you wanted me
to put in a good word... No.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.084
Thanks.

17:22.118 --> 17:24.979
Good to meet you, Mark.

17:25.013 --> 17:27.839
Yeah. I'll give you a bell.

17:36.239 --> 17:39.720
First, he'll go for the weblink
at the top of the page...

17:43.000 --> 17:47.400
Then he'll want to know what
other people say about the business.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.400
Now he'll see what
Owen has to say about himself.

17:57.919 --> 18:03.805
Welcome to the number one supplier of
jellied eels to Britain and Northern Europe.

18:03.840 --> 18:10.400
With a client base of more than 150 resellers, we're
constantly looking to expand into new territories.

18:10.435 --> 18:12.645
If you're interested in
becoming an affiliate

18:12.680 --> 18:16.840
or Harper's franchise holder,
please contact our Sales Director

18:16.875 --> 18:19.360
on the number below.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.080
Harper's sales. Jenny Long speaking.

18:27.115 --> 18:29.599
I'm sorry, wrong number.

18:29.634 --> 18:31.325
Job done.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.799
I've found another set of
suspicious injuries at the hospital.

18:34.834 --> 18:36.445
They sound pretty bad.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.124
Tosh, stay here and monitor
Mark Lynch's movements.

18:38.159 --> 18:42.440
lanto with me.. I'll come with you.
Go home. But... It's not a request.

18:42.475 --> 18:44.719
Remember - don't let it drift.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.484
What you doing?

19:07.519 --> 19:10.560
You here now, are you?
That's your pulling top.

19:10.595 --> 19:12.404
No, it's not. It is!

19:12.439 --> 19:15.480
That's what you call it,
since I said you looked sexy in it.

19:17.679 --> 19:22.685
You off out? Aye, Daf's stag do.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.725
All day job. Since when
is Daf getting married?

19:26.760 --> 19:30.205
He's not. But he thinks
he's missing out on a piss-up.

19:30.240 --> 19:35.479
He's having a Staying Single Stag.
Few beers, see what transpires.

19:35.514 --> 19:38.596
Strip club, that sort of thing.

19:38.631 --> 19:41.679
What time will you be back?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.525
Not sure.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.759
But... I'm in tonight.
Well, I'm not.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.524
I've already made
my statement to the police.

19:59.559 --> 20:03.640
According to your chart, you nearly
had your heart torn from your ribcage.

20:05.560 --> 20:09.999
Ten-hour operation
to repair chest wounds.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.844
Why should I talk to you?

20:12.879 --> 20:15.045
Let me tell you what did this to you.

20:15.080 --> 20:20.399
Six feet high,
teeth like a shark, rippled skin

20:20.434 --> 20:22.879
and the rage of a wild animal.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.539
Am I close?

20:26.574 --> 20:28.684
I was mugged.

20:28.719 --> 20:30.685
There was three of them,

20:30.720 --> 20:36.239
they had knives. So why were your wounds
described by paramedics as bite marks?

20:36.274 --> 20:39.445
Look, I can't help it
if they got mixed up.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.524
They're overworked. There are
lots of ways I can get

20:42.559 --> 20:49.240
you to talk, but the easiest would be if you consider
the consequences should you not tell me the truth.

20:49.275 --> 20:51.404
And that is,

20:51.439 --> 20:53.679
this creature will attack again.

20:53.714 --> 20:55.244
Somebody will die.

20:55.279 --> 20:58.600
And it will be on your conscience.

21:03.319 --> 21:07.039
Now tell us the truth. I can't.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.245
They'd kill me.

21:10.280 --> 21:14.440
Who'd kill you? Everyone.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.925
What did he mean, "everyone"?

21:19.960 --> 21:23.040
That was all he'd say. Couldn't get any
more out of him. That leaves us one option.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.885
OK, Janet. Time for a trip out.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.139
You call it Janet?
Barbara just never seemed right.

21:29.174 --> 21:32.359
You want to release a Weevil
in the middle of Cardiff?!

21:32.394 --> 21:35.084
Not exactly in the middle.
A little to the side.

21:35.119 --> 21:39.199
We placed a tracker in its boiler suit, so
when they capture it, we'll know where they are.

21:41.119 --> 21:44.239
It could kill any number of people
before then! I'm with Tosh.

21:44.274 --> 21:47.359
We set it loose in the same place
where they took the other one.

21:47.394 --> 21:49.644
It's deserted this

21:49.679 --> 21:52.240
time of night. We'll be with it
every step of the way.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.760
Tracker working? Yeah.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.600
Go Janet!

22:19.560 --> 22:21.919
Second right. 200 metres ahead.

22:26.919 --> 22:30.720
Shit! Stop the car!
She's taken a left.

22:30.755 --> 22:32.800
Pedestrian access only! Ahh!

22:38.560 --> 22:41.080
lanto, take over!

22:51.679 --> 22:53.719
Now that's what I call service.

22:53.754 --> 22:54.764
Cheers.

22:54.799 --> 22:58.240
Yeah. Cheers.

22:58.275 --> 22:59.839
Shit.

23:04.079 --> 23:06.240
We got a problem here, boys?
Not with you.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.520
Come on then,
let's get it over with.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.879
No need for you to get
involved, sweetheart.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.639
Get up!

23:39.599 --> 23:41.119
Thanks.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.520
The Weevil has landed.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.604
Got a signal?
Yeah.

24:09.639 --> 24:12.085
Just so I know where we stand?

24:12.120 --> 24:15.360
We would never deliberately
put a human being through that.

24:15.395 --> 24:17.640
But Weevils are fair game.
Is that right?

24:17.675 --> 24:19.400
We need to follow them.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.284
This is your gaff?

24:30.319 --> 24:36.519
Make yourself at home.
I'm in the wrong business.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.639
So, what's your outlet?

24:44.239 --> 24:46.999
Er, for what?

24:47.034 --> 24:49.724
The anger.

24:49.759 --> 24:52.600
Who said I was angry?

24:53.959 --> 24:58.759
You're not even living here yet and you've
got people coming after you! Yeah, well.

24:58.794 --> 25:00.845
some people need teaching a lesson.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.639
I'm not criticising. You're not
the only pissed off bloke out there.

25:04.674 --> 25:07.719
It's what the world does to us.
Fancy a beer?

25:07.754 --> 25:10.479
Yeah, why not.
You work yourself stupid.

25:10.514 --> 25:14.045
Get a house, a car, plasma screen...

25:14.080 --> 25:18.639
You end up with a workforce, people there
specifically to look after your every whim.

25:18.674 --> 25:20.719
You're officially successful.

25:20.754 --> 25:23.559
And what does it bring?

25:29.839 --> 25:33.164
Nothing. Success has
no worth other than itself.

25:33.199 --> 25:37.199
Seriously, I could live without
all this. It doesn't define me.

25:37.234 --> 25:40.279
Yeah, nice to have it, though, yeah?

25:40.314 --> 25:42.040
Ask yourself,

25:43.879 --> 25:46.240
what's the point of your life?

25:46.275 --> 25:48.165
Mark, mate,...

25:48.200 --> 25:49.999
I only came here for a beer.

25:51.599 --> 25:54.685
There's so much more.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.239
If you know where to look.

25:57.999 --> 26:00.000
Is that right?

26:03.560 --> 26:06.040
It's closer than you think.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.760
Something's coming.

26:10.795 --> 26:13.125
Out there

26:13.160 --> 26:17.160
in the darkness, something

26:17.195 --> 26:18.759
is coming.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.960
You drunk?
Two pints was all I could get down.

26:39.995 --> 26:41.920
They've gone on without me.

27:07.239 --> 27:09.840
Look, Gwen...
I need to tell you something.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.400
What sort of thing? I've been sleeping...
I've been having sex with someone else.

27:15.435 --> 27:17.605
From work.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.925
His name's Owen.

27:19.960 --> 27:23.559
He's a tosser and it's all gonna
stop but... Shut up. I'm sorry.

27:23.594 --> 27:25.324
I'm really sorry.

27:25.359 --> 27:27.280
You wouldn't do that! But I have.

27:30.639 --> 27:34.959
The.. then why are you telling me?
Because I'm ashamed. And I'm angry.

27:34.994 --> 27:37.856
And I want... I need...

27:37.891 --> 27:40.719
I need you to forgive me.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.525
And because I've drugged you.

27:46.560 --> 27:52.359
You've done what?! Just sit down. It's nothing,
it's just an amnesia pill. Dash of sedative.

27:52.394 --> 27:56.559
You'll wake up tomorrow, and you'll
forget everything. Rhys?

27:56.594 --> 28:00.524
God, you selfish bitch! I know,

28:00.559 --> 28:05.640
I just thought it would give us a chance, a
chance to get everything out in the open, you know?

28:05.675 --> 28:08.040
Get everything out.

28:10.159 --> 28:12.085
Rhys! Stay with me, Rhys!

28:12.120 --> 28:14.639
Say you forgive me,
say, "It's all right, Gwen.

28:14.674 --> 28:17.005
"Gwen, it's all right. "

28:17.040 --> 28:22.279
Say it, please, Rhys. Rhys, just say
it once, say it once, "I forgive you. "

28:22.314 --> 28:25.399
Rhys, please say it!
Say you forgive me!

28:25.434 --> 28:27.796
Say you forgive me, say it.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.159
Say it, please, say it.

28:30.194 --> 28:32.280
Say it, please.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.399
You found the bathroom yet?
Yeah, cheers!

29:52.920 --> 29:54.960
GROWLS

29:56.920 --> 30:00.960
Told you there was more to see. Mark, mate,
I'm really sorry. I couldn't resist a padlock...

30:00.995 --> 30:04.000
What do you think? What is it?

30:04.035 --> 30:05.485
No idea.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.440
Don't get too close, though.

30:08.475 --> 30:10.084
Vicious bastard.

30:10.119 --> 30:12.439
Where did you get it from?
I found one on the streets.

30:12.474 --> 30:14.896
It took five of us to bring it in.

30:14.931 --> 30:18.085
Other than that, haven't got a clue.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.240
Scientific experiment gone wrong?

30:21.275 --> 30:23.765
Nuclear victim?

30:23.800 --> 30:26.699
One of the lads even
reckons it's an alien.

30:26.734 --> 30:29.564
Want to know what I think?
Yeah, go on.

30:29.599 --> 30:34.119
I think it's us, Owen. You and me.
In a thousand years' time.

30:34.154 --> 30:38.640
This is what we become, when
all we have left is our rage.

30:38.675 --> 30:41.237
Not exactly a comforting thought.

30:41.272 --> 30:44.056
Give it a smack. You what? Punch it.

30:44.091 --> 30:46.725
Why? That's what it's there for.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.324
Or d'you want me to do it for you?

30:49.359 --> 30:51.520
It just feels a bit weird,
that's all.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.164
All right, that's enough!

31:06.199 --> 31:09.159
It's not exactly putting up a fight.

31:09.194 --> 31:10.920
We all need a punchbag.

31:13.839 --> 31:17.405
So, who are you, Owen? Sorry?

31:17.440 --> 31:21.319
It'd be pretty stupid not to assume that you're
not connected to those two in the black SUV.

31:21.354 --> 31:24.605
I dunno what you mean. Bloke in the
big coat, cute little Asian girl?

31:24.640 --> 31:28.879
I was watching. Nice website by the way, kudos
to whoever did that, although jellied eels...

31:28.914 --> 31:30.799
That wasn't your greatest idea.

31:33.839 --> 31:37.285
I wasn't that bad!
Pretty much, you were.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.565
Whoever you are, you've royally
fucked up my plans.

31:40.600 --> 31:46.639
Didn't want this getting out. What about
Dan Hodges, what about his wife and kid?

31:46.674 --> 31:50.119
I'm not responsible
for people's life choices.

31:50.154 --> 31:52.416
Now why did you lot take the body?

31:52.451 --> 31:54.644
Why didn't you go to the cops?

31:54.679 --> 31:58.999
Because, Mark, they are parochial
pigshits whose minds would implode

31:59.034 --> 32:02.040
if they saw this.
Who are you, Owen Harper?

32:04.279 --> 32:06.044
Is that who you are?

32:06.079 --> 32:09.764
A little kid hiding behind a gun.

32:09.799 --> 32:13.839
If you want to know what happens, you
won't find out because of a weapon.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.440
Good boy,
we're finally getting somewhere.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.479
Now you're just you. Stripping
things back to the core, Owen.

32:25.514 --> 32:27.485
Now, we're just two blokes.

32:27.520 --> 32:30.479
Equal.
Why did you murder Dan Hodges?

32:30.514 --> 32:32.725
I didn't.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.720
All right, not technically.

32:34.755 --> 32:36.805
Did you do it here?

32:36.840 --> 32:39.605
I mean, you let that thing
loose on him.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.480
The perfect murder. Nothing
to link you back to the crime.

32:43.515 --> 32:45.565
God, you haven't
got a clue, have you?

32:45.600 --> 32:50.080
Dan wasn't murdered. He was one
of us. Tell me what happened.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.199
I can do better than that.

32:54.234 --> 32:56.719
Come on!

33:10.119 --> 33:11.599
Hello?

33:20.199 --> 33:21.679
Anyone?

33:30.919 --> 33:33.520
So where is it, Tosh?

33:41.359 --> 33:43.645
So what have we got now? Nothing.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.879
We have no clue where they are
or what they're doing.

33:54.199 --> 33:57.480
So, what am I
supposed to be looking at?

33:57.515 --> 33:58.920
Wait and see.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.760
All this lot with you?
What's going on?

34:17.795 --> 34:20.684
You'll find out.

34:20.719 --> 34:24.360
I've never been that keen
on surprises.

36:58.519 --> 36:59.959
Jack, I...

37:22.399 --> 37:24.524
'Jack, can you hear me?'

37:24.559 --> 37:27.045
What the hell are you doing there? I
told you to go home.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.799
There's a text message that's just
come through on Dan Hodges' phone.

37:30.834 --> 37:34.244
'Charlie Foxtrot One
Zero Six Bravo Yankee. '

37:34.279 --> 37:38.400
Seems to be a postcode for a building. One
that's gonna have a Lynch Frost sign outside.

37:38.435 --> 37:41.239
OK, I've got the location.
Gwen, we'll pick you up on the way.

37:41.274 --> 37:44.040
People get a text message
and they head to a property?

37:44.075 --> 37:45.685
An empty property.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.319
So the question is -
what happens when they get there?

37:57.600 --> 37:59.839
What the hell's going on here?

37:59.874 --> 38:01.565
Warm-up. Warm-up?

38:01.600 --> 38:04.600
Who are these blokes? Same as us.

38:07.239 --> 38:11.479
Ordinary blokes trying to find meaning
in a world that doesn't have any.

38:11.514 --> 38:14.560
You don't really believe that?
We're the dispossessed now, Owen.

38:14.595 --> 38:17.239
All the certainties
our fathers had are gone.

38:18.799 --> 38:21.679
We're a generation of no faith.

38:21.714 --> 38:23.965
In society,

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
in religion... or in life.

38:28.035 --> 38:30.965
All we can do

38:31.000 --> 38:33.199
is reduce ourselves to the basics.

38:37.680 --> 38:42.240
This is only the warm-up. Come on.

38:42.275 --> 38:43.959
Coming or staying?

38:45.999 --> 38:51.040
Five, four, three, two, one!

39:23.400 --> 39:25.759
Get me out!

39:28.999 --> 39:31.604
Nice one, mate.
Costs a grand to enter the cage.

39:31.639 --> 39:35.040
Whoever stays in the longest takes
home all the money. You're next!

39:35.075 --> 39:37.964
So these guys are paying
to put their lives at risk?

39:37.999 --> 39:42.159
The ultimate extreme sport. Too much disposable
income, not enough meaning. That's us.

39:42.194 --> 39:44.800
So what about Dan Hodges, Mark?

39:44.835 --> 39:47.765
He wouldn't come out.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.000
Just stood in the middle
of the cage and let it maul him.

39:51.035 --> 39:53.760
I think he got in there
and he realised...

39:53.795 --> 39:55.724
he didn't want to live enough.

39:55.759 --> 39:59.439
He surrendered. None of us
could get to him in time.

39:59.474 --> 40:03.005
Yeah. And still you all come back.

40:03.040 --> 40:06.040
Well, what else is there?
This has to stop.

40:06.075 --> 40:07.800
More people are gonna die.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.560
How long are we going to keep
playing this game, Owen?

40:22.595 --> 40:23.800
You lie,

40:24.760 --> 40:27.560
you bullshit and sweet talk.

40:27.595 --> 40:30.360
But you are hiding, Owen.

40:36.399 --> 40:38.639
Get in the cage.

40:41.959 --> 40:44.160
Not if you're gonna
point a gun at me.

40:44.195 --> 40:45.600
Do you want me to shoot you?

40:45.635 --> 40:48.404
Lower the gun.

40:48.439 --> 40:52.960
And then I will get into the cage.

41:22.759 --> 41:24.999
Good boy.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.605
What's the longest anyone's been
in there? That'd be Dan Hodges.

41:32.640 --> 41:37.159
when you're up close with it, take
a look into its eyes. Open the door!

41:40.680 --> 41:45.839
It's like looking into the
darkest recesses of your own soul.

41:45.874 --> 41:48.799
Open the door!

43:01.759 --> 43:03.120
Owen!

43:04.879 --> 43:07.320
I said open the door!

43:07.355 --> 43:08.239
Jack!

43:12.160 --> 43:13.560
Open it!

43:15.240 --> 43:16.999
Owen? Get off me!

43:18.279 --> 43:21.039
That's enough!
Help me, Jack, help me get him out!

43:21.074 --> 43:23.839
Owen, come on... Get a stretcher!

43:32.640 --> 43:36.999
You did this to him. He did it
to himself, he had no fear.

43:43.080 --> 43:47.599
It's over now.
These creatures are to be left alone.

43:47.634 --> 43:50.680
Go back to your lives. Jack!

43:54.840 --> 43:58.560
What're you doing? It's over.

44:09.400 --> 44:14.200
THE MAN WRITHES IN AGONY

44:26.359 --> 44:28.159
You shouldn't have.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.040
No, really you shouldn't.
I hate grapes.

44:35.279 --> 44:37.519
Doctors reckon you can go home.

44:39.119 --> 44:41.640
Doctors. What do they know, eh?

44:45.439 --> 44:47.919
I didn't want saving.

44:50.919 --> 44:52.844
You want us to apologise?

44:52.879 --> 44:56.160
For a few seconds in that cage,

44:56.195 --> 45:00.600
I felt totally at peace.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.560
And then you blunder in.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.920
Do you always know best, Jack?

45:12.480 --> 45:14.764
Is that what you believe?

45:14.799 --> 45:18.120
Want you back in work tomorrow.

45:29.359 --> 45:33.000
You sure you'll be all right?
Give us a moment alone, yeah?

46:35.520 --> 46:39.439
Where's the SUV?
Has it been stolen?

46:39.474 --> 46:41.725
No, we have.

46:41.760 --> 46:45.240
They're stuck in the middle
of the Cardiff Blitz! Toshiko!

46:45.275 --> 46:47.165
It's our duty to get them out.

46:47.200 --> 46:50.799
Open the rift now and the whole world could
suffer. Or who knows what will come out?

46:50.834 --> 46:52.364
I love you.

46:52.399 --> 46:55.724
It's a trap to
incite total chaos and destruction!

46:55.759 --> 46:59.880
You don't even know who he is!
He's our leader. Not any more!

46:59.959 --> 47:02.520
Captain Jack Harkness,
133rd Squadron.

47:05.719 --> 47:07.719
