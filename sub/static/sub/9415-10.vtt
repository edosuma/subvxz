Something was not right.

Ah!

00:14.867 --> 00:16.467
Is this happening in your house?

00:16.468 --> 00:18.068
I'm just gonna ask you once.

00:18.069 --> 00:19.986
Are you telling the truth?

00:19.987 --> 00:22.006
I was in shock.

00:22.007 --> 00:23.741
I was scared.

01:01.379 --> 01:05.482
Back in 2006, I was living with my wife.

01:05.483 --> 01:09.664
And we were living at this
apartment in a decent part of town.

01:09.665 --> 01:12.845
She was my first love.

01:13.676 --> 01:17.456
We had this beautiful son Alec.

01:17.535 --> 01:20.366
- You do this all the time.
- What do you mean I do this all the time?

01:20.367 --> 01:24.268
But things started going
wrong in the marriage...

01:24.269 --> 01:27.271
I'm talking to you. Where have you been?

01:27.272 --> 01:31.912
And the poor boy was
just stuck in the middle.

01:31.913 --> 01:34.433
Remember this?

01:34.498 --> 01:38.349
I want to be happy. I want to be
with somebody that makes me happy.

They say that you need to give
the storm some time to pass.

01:50.328 --> 01:53.738
So I decided to move out.

[Siren wailing]

02:01.156 --> 02:05.848
I needed to find a place
as soon as possible.

02:05.849 --> 02:09.312
I drove by this place,
and I saw they had a sign.

02:09.314 --> 02:11.315
They were renting apartments.

02:11.316 --> 02:16.697
So I call them right away, could I
stop by and take a look at it now?

02:16.698 --> 02:17.961
They said, okay.

02:45.483 --> 02:46.851
- Let's go this way.
- Okay.

02:46.852 --> 02:49.559

02:51.056 --> 02:53.516
[Dog barking]

02:56.762 --> 03:02.042

me was on the second floor.

03:03.535 --> 03:05.785
I was a little nervous.

03:05.786 --> 03:10.586
You never know who you
might meet in Juarez.

03:12.544 --> 03:15.604
He put the key in...

03:17.182 --> 03:19.067
It was hard to open.

03:19.068 --> 03:22.879
The lock had been kind of, like, stuck.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.520
Needs some oil.

03:26.892 --> 03:30.040
I knew instantly that...

03:30.041 --> 03:34.961
This guy was not only
in real estate business.

03:45.667 --> 03:48.307
We go inside...

03:53.919 --> 03:56.253
But it was a complete mess.

03:56.254 --> 03:58.623
It's dirty, but you were in such a rush.

03:58.624 --> 03:59.924
Don't worry about it.

03:59.925 --> 04:02.927
Then that's when I noticed...

04:02.928 --> 04:05.195
The windows were painted black.

04:05.196 --> 04:07.865
I thought that was kind of odd.

04:07.866 --> 04:09.500
Why are the windows black?

04:09.501 --> 04:12.603
And then he said, oh, the

Okay.

04:26.198 --> 04:30.218
I needed to move somewhere quickly.

04:30.306 --> 04:33.426
That place would work.

I knew I had to do this
for my whole family's sake.

04:52.966 --> 04:56.110

there was only so much that I could afford.

stationed in Juarez.

the area I had moved into.

Seriously, Chris, you ought
to watch your back around here.

05:54.239 --> 05:56.696
Then I said, this ain't so bad.

Next morning, same
routine as every morning.

07:52.952 --> 07:56.852

I knew I had hung them
up as I always do...

08:13.345 --> 08:16.585

08:22.687 --> 08:27.727
I started looking frantically
all over the place.

08:32.063 --> 08:37.962
Then I remembered that the night
before I had heard something.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.945
They were not just on
the edge of the couch.

08:47.946 --> 08:52.301
They were, like, thrown
far underneath the couch.

08:52.302 --> 08:54.631
The only way they could
have ended up down there

08:54.632 --> 08:58.476
was if somebody had
physically put them there.

08:58.477 --> 09:03.337
I was the only person
there at the apartment.

09:04.229 --> 09:10.109
I knew I had hung them up on
the hook as I do every day.

09:12.170 --> 09:16.790
I just couldn't explain
how that happened.

09:23.446 --> 09:26.386
Then other things...

09:26.584 --> 09:29.764
Also started to happen.

09:39.293 --> 09:45.053
One night I was in the kitchen
preparing something to eat.

09:45.628 --> 09:51.041
I'm a neat guy, so when I'm
done, I put everything away.

09:51.042 --> 09:56.262

and go to watch some TV.

10:59.677 --> 11:03.457
Then I'm thinking, am I crazy?

kitchen moments before.
