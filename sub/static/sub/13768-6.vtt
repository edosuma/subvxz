00:15.808 --> 00:17.100
Aha.

00:34.910 --> 00:38.079

00:38.121 --> 00:40.791
Hal, could you replace

00:38.121 --> 00:40.791
that light bulb in the kitchen?

00:40.833 --> 00:43.585
What does it look like

00:40.833 --> 00:43.585
I'm doing?!

01:22.082 --> 01:23.208
Here we are, Bernard.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.126
This is my cage.

01:26.962 --> 01:29.130
Are you serious?

01:29.172 --> 01:30.841
Mom, Dad...

01:30.883 --> 01:31.967
This is Bernard.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.385
He's the hamster

01:32.009 --> 01:33.385
from my class.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.930
Remember? It's my weekend

01:33.427 --> 01:35.930
to take care of him.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.015
Dewey, please.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.015
This isn't a good time.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.392
I just want you to see how good

01:38.057 --> 01:40.392
I could be at taking care him.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.770
Just like how good I would be

01:40.434 --> 01:42.770
at taking care of a dog.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.145
I don't know

01:44.187 --> 01:45.981
if I mentioned

01:44.187 --> 01:45.981
that all the other kids

01:46.023 --> 01:47.649
in the neighborhood have dogs.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.027
Honey, your father and I

01:47.691 --> 01:50.027
need to talk.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.780
I saw a nice one

01:51.111 --> 01:52.780
at the pet store.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.573
He's half Great Dane

01:52.821 --> 01:54.573
and something else.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.783
I could name him Jeff and...

01:55.824 --> 01:57.367
Go play in your room!

01:57.409 --> 01:58.869
Okay.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.167
I'll put your cage right here,

02:03.415 --> 02:06.167
Bernard.

02:06.209 --> 02:10.047
Sorry I talked about wanting

02:06.209 --> 02:10.047
a dog in front of you.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.424
Is your brain big enough

02:10.089 --> 02:12.424
to get your feelings hurt?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.175
Me neither.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.887
But don't worry, I'll still

02:14.217 --> 02:16.887
take really good care of you.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.641
Bernard?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.692
(squeaking)

02:36.239 --> 02:38.867
But, Hal, I thought you were

02:36.239 --> 02:38.867
just getting a routine check-up.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.202
That's when they usually

02:38.909 --> 02:41.202
find these things.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.496
Can't they

02:41.244 --> 02:42.496
do anything?

02:42.537 --> 02:45.040
No, not until they get

02:42.537 --> 02:45.040
the biopsy back.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.169
There you are.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.799
You can't call

02:52.047 --> 02:53.799
that a shortcut!

02:53.841 --> 02:55.676
A shortcut has

02:53.841 --> 02:55.676
to be shorter!

02:55.717 --> 02:57.136
REESE:

02:55.717 --> 02:57.136
Says who?

02:57.176 --> 02:58.846
Says the word!

02:58.887 --> 03:01.264
No, a shortcut is just when

02:58.887 --> 03:01.264
you don't use regular streets.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.599
So, according to you,

03:02.641 --> 03:04.225
if it took 150 years

03:02.641 --> 03:04.225
to cross the street,

03:04.267 --> 03:07.062
just as long as you went

03:04.267 --> 03:07.062
through some bushes and trees,

03:07.104 --> 03:08.396
that would qualify

03:07.104 --> 03:08.396
as a shortcut?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.315
God, you hate being wrong.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.067
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.070
What is wrong

03:13.276 --> 03:15.070
with you?!

03:15.112 --> 03:16.237
Look at that floor!

03:16.279 --> 03:17.614
Oh, sorry.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.324
How many times

03:17.656 --> 03:19.324
have I told you

03:19.366 --> 03:21.242
don't track mud

03:19.366 --> 03:21.242
into this house?!

03:21.284 --> 03:22.243
We'll clean it up.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.244
That's not good enough!

03:23.286 --> 03:24.454
You're grounded

03:23.286 --> 03:24.454
for a week!

03:24.496 --> 03:25.873
What?!

03:24.496 --> 03:25.873
You can't do that.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.248
It's just some

03:25.914 --> 03:27.248
stupid footprints.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.750
You want to be

03:27.290 --> 03:28.750
grounded for two weeks?

03:28.792 --> 03:29.668
Dad?

03:29.710 --> 03:30.878
You heard your mother!

03:30.919 --> 03:31.837
This is ridiculous!

03:31.879 --> 03:33.130
You're being totally unfair!

03:33.172 --> 03:35.049
Just because Malcolm

03:33.172 --> 03:35.049
got mud on his shoes

03:35.090 --> 03:37.092
and thoughtlessly

03:35.090 --> 03:37.092
tracked it through the house

03:37.134 --> 03:38.719
doesn't mean he should

03:37.134 --> 03:38.719
be grounded.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.221
Go to your room. Now!

03:42.931 --> 03:44.850
What is her problem?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.560
Mom and Dad--

03:44.892 --> 03:46.560
their lives are so boring

03:46.601 --> 03:49.104
they have to invent

03:46.601 --> 03:49.104
stuff to be upset about.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.653
Are you the biggest idiot

03:52.983 --> 03:56.653
to ever walk this Earth?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.155
Good morning.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.323
What'd I tell you

03:58.197 --> 04:00.323
to do, jackass?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.910
To paint the kitchen.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.910
Which I'm doing.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.537
What kind of a moron

04:02.951 --> 04:05.537
paints a kitchen white?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.539
You want to see

04:05.579 --> 04:07.539
all the dirt?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.290
What do they teach you

04:07.581 --> 04:09.290
in college, anyway?

04:09.332 --> 04:12.169
For your information,

04:09.332 --> 04:12.169
I'm a high school dropout.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.295
And I used the paint

04:12.211 --> 04:14.295
that you set out for me.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.463
I moved that paint

04:15.505 --> 04:16.965
so you could get

04:15.505 --> 04:16.965
to the green, idiot.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.341
Now, you're going

04:17.007 --> 04:18.341
to do this over.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.510
I don't care if you're

04:18.383 --> 04:20.510
here all night doing it.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.303
What?!

04:20.552 --> 04:22.303
That paint you wasted

04:22.345 --> 04:24.973
is coming out of your pay.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.307
Maybe I should

04:26.349 --> 04:28.518
just paint it the same color

04:26.349 --> 04:28.518
as your dye job.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.315
What?

04:34.357 --> 04:35.567
He didn't say anything.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.694
I said...

04:37.736 --> 04:41.322
maybe I should just paint it

04:37.736 --> 04:41.322
the same color as your dye job,

04:41.364 --> 04:43.700
you sagging, leathery,

04:41.364 --> 04:43.700
hatchet-faced,

04:43.742 --> 04:45.744
dried-up old hag.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.996
All right, college boy,

04:48.038 --> 04:49.539
you want it, you got it.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.332
I'm going to kick your ass.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.333
Excuse me?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.752
I'm kicking your ass.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.255
You don't ever

04:53.794 --> 04:56.255
disrespect me like that.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.547
Francis, what

04:56.296 --> 04:57.547
are you doing?

04:57.589 --> 04:58.840
You can't challenge

04:57.589 --> 04:58.840
Lavernia to a fight.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.175
I didn't

04:58.882 --> 05:00.175
challenge anybody.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.510
Hey, Lavernia's fighting

05:00.217 --> 05:02.510
college boy!

05:02.552 --> 05:03.511
(men shouting)

05:03.553 --> 05:04.763
MAN:

05:03.553 --> 05:04.763
We got an opening

05:04.805 --> 05:06.514
Sunday at 2:00

05:04.805 --> 05:06.514
before Mass.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.851
Sunday, 2:00--

05:06.556 --> 05:09.851
your ass, my foot.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.228
This is insane.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.353
There's no way

05:11.270 --> 05:12.353
I'm going to fight a woman.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.815
If I don't mind,

05:12.395 --> 05:14.815
why should you?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.608
(men oohing, laughing)

05:16.650 --> 05:18.401
Did you see

05:16.650 --> 05:18.401
what she did there?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.445
She as much as

05:18.443 --> 05:20.445
called him a woman.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.363
It's going to be

05:20.487 --> 05:22.363
a bloodbath.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.616
(men laughing, cheering)

05:30.038 --> 05:32.249
(squeaking)

05:42.341 --> 05:43.885
Yeah, you're right, Dewey.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.014
When  was  the last time

05:43.927 --> 05:47.014
we played ball?

05:47.055 --> 05:48.682
I don't know.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.226
Sometimes life just

05:48.723 --> 05:51.226
gets away from you

05:51.268 --> 05:54.229
and you forget the things

05:51.268 --> 05:54.229
that are really important.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.524
(yelling)

05:58.441 --> 05:59.400
This is crazy.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.236
I have enough

05:59.442 --> 06:01.236
on my mind

06:01.278 --> 06:03.446
without worrying about you

06:01.278 --> 06:03.446
boys and your shenanigans.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.615
But, Mom...

06:03.488 --> 06:05.615
You and your brother

06:03.488 --> 06:05.615
are not to leave this room.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.826
I don't want to see you,

06:05.657 --> 06:07.826
I don't want to hear you,

06:07.868 --> 06:11.038
I don't want to so much

06:07.868 --> 06:11.038
as sense your presence...

06:11.079 --> 06:13.207
For crying out loud, Reese!

06:13.248 --> 06:15.416
There's a mirror

06:13.248 --> 06:15.416
right there!

06:15.458 --> 06:19.420
Believe me, I am going

06:15.458 --> 06:19.420
to watch that door like a hawk.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.343
What's her problem?

06:24.383 --> 06:25.886
This can't just

06:24.383 --> 06:25.886
be about the mud.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.428
There's something

06:25.927 --> 06:27.428
else going on.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.056
What have you

06:27.470 --> 06:29.056
done lately?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.432
The Richardsons' fire,

06:29.097 --> 06:31.432
the Blodgets' windshield,

06:31.474 --> 06:33.518
the Sampsons' fire,

06:31.474 --> 06:33.518
the Jacksons' fire.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.436
Nothing she knows about.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.356
This sucks.

06:37.438 --> 06:41.442
Well, if you can't do the time,

06:37.438 --> 06:41.442
then don't do the crime.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.861
See you Monday.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.238
Hey, moron.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.906
Do you know

06:44.279 --> 06:45.906
what tomorrow night is?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.366
Christine Maxton's party.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.326
What? That's this weekend?

06:49.368 --> 06:51.245
Yeah, and her sister Gina's

06:49.368 --> 06:51.245
bringing all their friends

06:51.286 --> 06:52.329
from Catholic school.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.330
I love those girls.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.373
I hear they tongue kiss

06:54.413 --> 06:55.456
whether they like you or not.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.084
It's like

06:55.498 --> 06:57.084
shaking hands to them.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.877
It's some kind

06:57.125 --> 06:58.877
of cultural thing.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.461
We have to go.

07:00.503 --> 07:04.465
Reese, if I show you a way

07:00.503 --> 07:04.465
we can go to the party,

07:04.507 --> 07:07.135
do you promise never

07:04.507 --> 07:07.135
to let anyone find out,

07:07.177 --> 07:08.845
even though

07:07.177 --> 07:08.845
you're an idiot?

07:08.887 --> 07:09.846
I swear.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.514
Okay.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.353
I was saving this

07:13.516 --> 07:16.353
for a life-or-death emergency.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.480
Or a really, really good party.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.941
Tell me!

07:26.738 --> 07:28.865
No way. I'm not

07:26.738 --> 07:28.865
hitting Mom with that.

07:28.907 --> 07:32.160
Reese, tomorrow night, after

07:28.907 --> 07:32.160
everyone's gone to bed,

07:32.202 --> 07:33.494
we take out the floorboard

07:33.536 --> 07:35.496
and sneak outside

07:33.536 --> 07:35.496
through the crawl space.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.167
Wow. Tunneling out

07:35.538 --> 07:39.167
of our own room.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.378
She can't

07:39.209 --> 07:41.378
lock us in anymore.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.670
Mom's powerless.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.006
Yeah, now she's just

07:42.712 --> 07:45.006
a crazy old lady

07:45.048 --> 07:46.716
we happen to live with.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.490
Thanks, Dewey!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.787
There's Dewey.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.787
Let's hurt him, fellow idiot.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.498
Yes, I hate him for

08:15.829 --> 08:18.498
his handsomeness.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.436
Hi, Dewey.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.561
Hi, Lance.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.439
Well, what do you know.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.564
It's Bernard.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.565
Let me see him.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.733
You can't have him.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.777
That's all right,

08:45.775 --> 08:47.777
I can wait.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.364
Next week is

08:47.819 --> 08:50.364
my turn to have him.

08:50.405 --> 08:54.075
We're going to have

08:50.405 --> 08:54.075
a lot of fun.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.456
You cannot keep the hamster.

08:59.498 --> 09:00.790
He belongs to the class.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.043
But he won't be safe.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.043
Dewey, I know you take

09:03.084 --> 09:04.878
good care of him, but

09:03.084 --> 09:04.878
you have to share him

09:04.919 --> 09:06.004
with your friends.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.588
Lance is not my friend.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.591
He tore Billy's shirt off

09:07.630 --> 09:10.591
after school, and...

09:10.633 --> 09:12.219
(phone ringing)

09:12.260 --> 09:15.305
Hello! Yes, this is he!

09:15.347 --> 09:17.182
He killed a frog

09:15.347 --> 09:17.182
and brought it

09:17.224 --> 09:18.599
to school and showed everybody.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.185
Dewey, I said no!

09:20.227 --> 09:22.312
Do you want to be grounded

09:20.227 --> 09:22.312
like your brothers?

09:22.354 --> 09:24.605
No.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.110
Man, I've never seen Lavernia

09:26.358 --> 09:29.110
this worked up for a fight.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.611
You mean she's done this before?

09:30.653 --> 09:32.447
In the two months

09:30.653 --> 09:32.447
I've been here,

09:32.489 --> 09:34.199
she's fought five guys.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.199
Consider yourself lucky

09:34.241 --> 09:35.616
you got some warning.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.453
You know Big Don

09:35.658 --> 09:38.453
from accounting?

09:38.495 --> 09:39.620
The guy with one ear?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.248
Yeah. He was going to the privy,

09:41.289 --> 09:43.666
and she dropped on him

09:41.289 --> 09:43.666
just like a spider.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.419
What is wrong with her?!

09:45.460 --> 09:47.546
We were just having

09:45.460 --> 09:47.546
a stupid little argument.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.506
How did it suddenly

09:47.587 --> 09:49.506
turn into a fight?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.007
That's how we

09:49.548 --> 09:51.007
settle things up there.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.301
There are three other fights

09:51.049 --> 09:53.301
scheduled for tomorrow.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.635
Four.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.514
Ned cut in front of Daryl

09:54.677 --> 09:57.514
at the mess line.

09:57.556 --> 09:58.639
Well, I hate

09:57.556 --> 09:58.639
to disappoint you guys,

09:58.681 --> 10:00.308
but I'm not fighting Lavernia.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.809
Really?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.061
Are you sure?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.230
No, no, he'll fight her.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.856
No, I won't.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.608
Thank you!

10:09.484 --> 10:10.651
Hey, fellas, looks like

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
we're going to have us

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
a coward's cotillion!

10:12.695 --> 10:13.738
(men cheering)

10:13.780 --> 10:14.822
I'll get the dogs ready.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.450
I'll sharpen

10:14.864 --> 10:16.450
the pig-sticker.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.535
Wait-wait-wait.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.535
What are you talking about?

10:18.577 --> 10:21.246
Look, fighting's the only

10:18.577 --> 10:21.246
entertainment we get up here.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.663
You've seen our TV reception.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.542
So if somebody cheats

10:22.705 --> 10:25.542
the boys out of a fight,

10:25.584 --> 10:27.544
they have a

10:25.584 --> 10:27.544
coward's cotillion.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.670
What the hell

10:27.586 --> 10:29.670
is a coward's cotillion?!

10:29.712 --> 10:31.672
Oh, it's always

10:29.712 --> 10:31.672
a little different.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.467
You never know

10:31.714 --> 10:33.467
what kind of animal

10:33.508 --> 10:35.135
the blood's going to attract.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.596
So my choices are,

10:35.176 --> 10:37.596
I have to fight a woman

10:37.637 --> 10:39.680
or do this stupid

10:37.637 --> 10:39.680
cotillion thing?

10:39.722 --> 10:40.765
Well...

10:40.807 --> 10:45.645
there's always

10:40.807 --> 10:45.645
the howdy stranger.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.402
(squeaking)

11:11.004 --> 11:12.880
How can they make us

11:11.004 --> 11:12.880
wait another 24 hours?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.383
Apparently they're

11:12.922 --> 11:15.383
shorthanded at the lab.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.136
Don't they realize

11:15.425 --> 11:18.136
this is someone's life?

11:23.766 --> 11:24.892
Don't worry, Bernard.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.603
This is for the best.

11:26.645 --> 11:27.728
I'm setting you free.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.938
You won't have to worry

11:28.980 --> 11:31.358
about anyone being mean

11:28.980 --> 11:31.358
to you anymore.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.820
Come on, Bernard, run.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.738
Run like the wind.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.413
You have to do this, Bernard.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.333
It's for your own good.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.585
I'll be okay.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.759
Go on.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.761
I don't want you anymore.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.055
I don't like you.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.224
I never did.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.644
Go on.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.647
Go on, you dumb old hamster.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.738
Bye, Bernard.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.792
Booby-trapped?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
A broom handle

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
tied to a string of tin cans.

12:33.836 --> 12:34.837
A classic.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.797
You know,

12:34.879 --> 12:36.797
if Mom ever trusted us,

12:36.839 --> 12:38.966
I think she'd be

12:36.839 --> 12:38.966
pleasantly surprised.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.802
Yeah, we're basically good kids.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.471
She's so unreasonable.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.182
You almost ready?

12:46.224 --> 12:47.308
Just a sec.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.561
Will you come on?

12:58.861 --> 13:01.948
Remember, if anyone asks,

12:58.861 --> 13:01.948
I'm a junior in college.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.786
(faint pounding)

13:15.670 --> 13:18.797
(grunting)

13:44.324 --> 13:46.117
My boys.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.794
You don't know

13:53.708 --> 13:55.794
how lucky you are.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.961
Everything is new.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.879
Everything is open to you.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.882
Please don't ever

13:58.921 --> 14:01.882
take that for granted.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.094
Make every moment

14:01.924 --> 14:05.094
the best you possibly can.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.517
God, I am so proud

14:06.929 --> 14:10.517
of all of you.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.647
You kids are the best thing

14:12.977 --> 14:15.647
I've ever done.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.735
You'll never know

14:17.315 --> 14:20.735
how much I love you.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.324
Maybe you're not supposed to.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.581
Sleep well, my little angels.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.833
(shrieking)

14:36.543 --> 14:37.918
(screaming)

14:37.960 --> 14:39.212
(shrieking)

14:42.423 --> 14:43.591
This was amazing.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.510
I made out

14:43.633 --> 14:45.510
with a sophomore.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.595
I am so far

14:45.552 --> 14:47.595
ahead of schedule.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.306
Did you see the TV set fly

14:47.637 --> 14:50.306
off the roof into the pool?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.559
That was me.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.858
Man, I hope we get

14:56.979 --> 14:59.858
grounded next weekend.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.989
(boys screaming)

15:12.912 --> 15:13.954
How dare you?!

15:13.996 --> 15:15.540
How dare you defy us like that?!

15:15.582 --> 15:17.625
Well, we wouldn't have

15:15.582 --> 15:17.625
had to if you hadn't been

15:17.667 --> 15:19.419
ridiculously hard over a

15:17.667 --> 15:19.419
little mud on the floor!

15:19.460 --> 15:21.755
You two

15:19.460 --> 15:21.755
are the most ungrateful,

15:21.796 --> 15:24.965
badly-behaved,

15:21.796 --> 15:24.965
inconsiderate boys ever born!

15:25.007 --> 15:27.051
How could you

15:25.007 --> 15:27.051
be so heartless?!

15:27.093 --> 15:29.220
What is heartless

15:27.093 --> 15:29.220
about going to a party

15:29.262 --> 15:30.971
with a bunch

15:29.262 --> 15:30.971
of slutty girls?

15:31.013 --> 15:31.972
Be cool.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.767
You were at a party?

15:33.808 --> 15:35.476
While we were

15:33.808 --> 15:35.476
here worrying?!

15:35.518 --> 15:37.771
Can I have a napkin?

15:37.812 --> 15:40.022
I cannot believe you two!

15:40.064 --> 15:41.816
All right, that's it!

15:41.858 --> 15:44.985
You are grounded for the rest

15:41.858 --> 15:44.985
of the school year!

15:45.027 --> 15:45.986
You can't do that!

15:46.028 --> 15:47.488
You're crazy!

15:47.530 --> 15:49.990
You do not talk to your

15:47.530 --> 15:49.990
mother that way ever!

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
You will show her

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
nothing but the love

15:52.034 --> 15:55.246
and respect she deserves,

15:52.034 --> 15:55.246
whether I am here or not!

15:55.288 --> 15:56.497
This family sucks!

15:56.539 --> 15:58.374
You are ruining our lives!

15:58.416 --> 15:59.959
I wish you were dead!

16:08.050 --> 16:09.636
What was that

16:08.050 --> 16:09.636
all about?

16:09.677 --> 16:11.011
I don't know.

16:11.053 --> 16:14.641
She usually just says,

16:11.053 --> 16:14.641
"I'm taking you with me."

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
Lavernia, I want

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
to tell you something.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.439
We'll talk at 2:00.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.817
No, I'm going to tell you

16:21.481 --> 16:23.817
this right now.

16:23.858 --> 16:24.859
I hate your guts.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.694
You are the most horrible person

16:26.736 --> 16:28.028
I have ever met.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.949
You are mean, sadistic,

16:28.070 --> 16:30.949
twisted and spiteful.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.700
And I owe you an apology.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.035
Because what I said to you

16:35.077 --> 16:36.454
didn't have anything

16:35.077 --> 16:36.454
to do with that;

16:36.496 --> 16:38.080
it was just a cheap shot

16:36.496 --> 16:38.080
about your looks

16:38.122 --> 16:40.708
and you don't deserve that--

16:38.122 --> 16:40.708
no one deserves that.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.044
You're right.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.046
Thank you.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.132
What the hell are we

16:46.088 --> 16:48.132
doing this for, anyway?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.050
This isn't going

16:48.174 --> 16:50.050
to solve anything.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.137
We're just putting on a show

16:50.092 --> 16:53.137
for bunch of slack-jawed idiots.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.515
I don't know if you think you

16:53.179 --> 16:55.515
have to prove something to them

16:55.556 --> 16:57.057
because you're a woman,

16:55.556 --> 16:57.057
but you don't.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.935
You came up here

16:57.099 --> 16:58.935
all alone

16:58.977 --> 17:00.854
and you built

16:58.977 --> 17:00.854
a successful business

17:00.895 --> 17:02.062
in this god-awful place.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.857
You have accomplished plenty.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.066
Oh, my God.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.735
You're coming on to me.

17:07.777 --> 17:08.987
What?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.154
Well, you better

17:09.028 --> 17:10.154
peddle your sugar

17:10.196 --> 17:12.657
to somebody else, 'cause

17:10.196 --> 17:12.657
this bee ain't buying.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.783
What?!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.117
The last thing I need

17:15.159 --> 17:17.745
is some young punk

17:15.159 --> 17:17.745
frolicking in my nethers.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.580
You don't listen to...

17:19.622 --> 17:21.457
I try to talk to you...

17:21.499 --> 17:23.376
Ew!

17:25.712 --> 17:27.171
Do you hear anything?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.756
Mom's still crying.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.675
Did she ever

17:28.798 --> 17:30.675
go to sleep?

17:30.717 --> 17:33.887
Around 3:00, she went from

17:30.717 --> 17:33.887
sobbing to a quiet whimper.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.514
I'm telling you, she's just

17:33.928 --> 17:36.514
trying to psych us out.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.515
I don't think so.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.266
I mean,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.266
when was the last time

17:39.308 --> 17:41.143
you heard Dad yell

17:39.308 --> 17:41.143
and Mom cry?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.478
You're right.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.397
Something really

17:42.520 --> 17:44.397
weird is going on.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.983
They've been

17:44.438 --> 17:46.983
whispering a lot, too.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.651
I just figured it out.

17:49.569 --> 17:53.489
Oh, no... oh, no!

17:53.531 --> 17:54.949
(crowd cheering)

17:54.991 --> 17:57.368
(grunts)

17:57.410 --> 17:59.037
Come on. Come on.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.538
Big hit. Big hit.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.538
Oh, come on.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
(crowd cheering)

18:05.167 --> 18:06.961
(laughs)

18:05.167 --> 18:06.961
I've never seen

18:05.167 --> 18:06.961
her like this.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.128
What do you expect?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.714
The boy tried

18:08.170 --> 18:09.714
to jump in bed with her

18:09.756 --> 18:11.424
without so much

18:09.756 --> 18:11.424
as a "howdy-do."

18:11.465 --> 18:13.509
Dude, she's killing you.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.552
Do something.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.013
I will not hit a woman.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.138
Well, then here, take this.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.724
What is it?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.724
Screwdriver.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.059
Jab and twist.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.061
I'm not using a screw...

18:23.102 --> 18:24.353
(yelling)

18:28.900 --> 18:30.651
Fight... back.

18:30.693 --> 18:31.819
Fight...

18:31.861 --> 18:33.529
back!

18:33.571 --> 18:35.155
Lavernia, ease up on the boy.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.033
His only crime was loving you.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.158
(whimpers)

18:38.200 --> 18:39.201
You disgust me.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.788
You better run

18:39.243 --> 18:41.788
home to mama

18:41.829 --> 18:43.081
so she can kiss your tears away

18:43.122 --> 18:45.165
and make you cocoa

18:43.122 --> 18:45.165
and tell you...

18:45.207 --> 18:46.417
(crowd cheering)

18:46.459 --> 18:48.628
For your information,

18:48.669 --> 18:50.797
my mother's a tormenting

18:48.669 --> 18:50.797
control freak,

18:50.838 --> 18:54.008
and it would never even

18:50.838 --> 18:54.008
occur to her to make me cocoa.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.189
You're going down,

19:06.729 --> 19:09.189
college boy.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.901
Bring it on, you toad.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.292
(both grunt)

19:50.314 --> 19:53.651
(crowd cheering)

19:53.693 --> 19:55.235
Ed, Daryl, you're up.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.947
Somebody help me

19:55.277 --> 19:57.947
clear this floor.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.123
(sighs)

20:07.165 --> 20:09.709
All right, I'll get the camera.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.256
Remember,

20:14.005 --> 20:16.256
if anyone at school asks,

20:16.298 --> 20:17.633
you're name's Bernard.

20:17.675 --> 20:21.095
You like carrots

20:17.675 --> 20:21.095
and having your tummy scratched.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.431
HAL:

20:22.763 --> 20:24.431
Well, I need to know.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.266
No. We have been

20:24.473 --> 20:26.266
waiting for hours.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.853
Now, please...

20:28.895 --> 20:30.855
Negative?! Negative!

20:30.897 --> 20:33.149
That's the good one, right?

20:33.191 --> 20:35.943
Yes! Thank you. Oh, God.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.702
If Mom does a load of blankets,

20:40.489 --> 20:44.702
I'll bring you a friend.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.748
Mom, Dad,

20:45.912 --> 20:48.748
we have something to say.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.168
We know why you've been

20:50.332 --> 20:52.168
crying so much lately.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.170
You don't have to

20:52.210 --> 20:54.170
protect us from this.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.296
We think getting a

20:54.212 --> 20:56.296
divorce is a great idea.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.465
What?

20:56.338 --> 20:58.465
You don't

20:56.338 --> 20:58.465
have to stay

20:58.507 --> 21:00.093
together for us--

20:58.507 --> 21:00.093
we've known for years

21:00.134 --> 21:01.094
your marriage was a sham.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.302
REESE:

21:01.135 --> 21:02.302
I mean, clearly

21:02.344 --> 21:04.180
your relationship

21:02.344 --> 21:04.180
isn't working.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.390
Mom, you need someone who's

21:04.222 --> 21:06.390
going to control you better.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.975
And Dad needs

21:06.432 --> 21:07.975
someone younger.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.769
MALCOLM: You both

21:08.017 --> 21:09.769
deserve some happiness.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.146
In fact, I think

21:09.810 --> 21:12.146
we all do.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.313
Amen to that.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.608
So I guess we

21:14.398 --> 21:15.608
should be going

21:15.649 --> 21:17.110
to a motel with

21:15.649 --> 21:17.110
Dad or something?

21:17.151 --> 21:18.194
Our bags are packed.

21:18.236 --> 21:19.319
And don't worry, Mom,

21:19.361 --> 21:20.696
you'll still be

21:19.361 --> 21:20.696
part of our lives.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.198
We'll see you

21:20.738 --> 21:22.198
every other weekend,

21:22.240 --> 21:24.200
and feel free

21:22.240 --> 21:24.200
to call us anytime.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.414
We've already discussed it.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.126
I get full custody.
