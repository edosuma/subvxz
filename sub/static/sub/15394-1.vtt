00:38.552 --> 00:40.392
Fiona.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.053
Fiona.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.249
- Falling asleep?
- No.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.485
- I think you are.
- No.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.865
- Are you sure?
- I am.

00:52.965 --> 00:55.156
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.759
My stomach's gonna start growling
any second now.

00:58.859 --> 01:02.471
- I think you're falling asleep.
- I'm not falling asleep.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.266
- Don't start.
- What? Start what?

01:06.366 --> 01:08.253
- What? What did I start?
- This.

01:08.353 --> 01:10.779
- What did I star?
- This.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.940
Stop it.

01:14.814 --> 01:16.862
Stop.

01:16.962 --> 01:20.214
- Stop it! It's not fair.
- What? I don't know what you're talking about.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.017
- What?
- Because you're not... you're not ticklish.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.828
- It's not fair.
- Oh, sorry.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.299
Stop!

01:32.726 --> 01:34.763
Don't make fun of me.

01:35.123 --> 01:37.398
Don't go away, yo.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.501
- Okay?
- K.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.478
K?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.329
<i>One new message.</i>

03:43.088 --> 03:47.760
<i>Fiona, it's Juan. Where are you?
I just tried your cell phone.</i>

03:47.860 --> 03:50.731
<i>I don't know what you want me to do.
I'm gonna go ahead and start the meeting.</i>

03:50.831 --> 03:53.341
<i>Come late if you can. Call me.</i>

04:00.172 --> 04:03.785
<i>Hey. This is Fiona. Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

04:03.885 --> 04:05.720
<i>Thanks.</i>

04:11.484 --> 04:13.854
<i>Sherwin, it's me.</i>

04:14.454 --> 04:16.380
<i>I think you're right.</i>

04:16.481 --> 04:19.742
<i>We should go see my mom
before it's too late.</i>

04:19.841 --> 04:23.055
<i>I'll call you on the way home. Love you.</i>

04:45.218 --> 04:49.257
- Fiona?
- <i>Hi. Is this Sherwin Owens?</i>

04:50.057 --> 04:52.088
Yeah, who's this?

04:52.188 --> 04:55.729
- <i>You live at 21 Long Avenue?</i>
- Yeah, I do.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.399
<i>This is Officer Holson,
the Atlanta Police Department.</i>

04:58.499 --> 05:02.745
<i>We sent an officer by twice today
to get in contact with you.</i>

05:04.170 --> 05:06.573
What is this concerning?

05:06.673 --> 05:09.248
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this
over the phone, Mr. Owens,</i>

05:09.348 --> 05:12.546
<i>but your wife was involved
in a traffic accident.</i>

05:12.646 --> 05:15.357
<i>And it was a fatal accident.</i>

05:26.993 --> 05:30.617
<i>Mr. Owens, you're still here?
Would you like to speak to someone, sir?</i>

05:30.717 --> 05:33.300
<i>We can send an officer by immediately.</i>

05:37.238 --> 05:40.174
Can you... can you please...

05:40.574 --> 05:42.982
can you please...

05:44.503 --> 05:47.073
can you help... but can you...

06:08.434 --> 06:11.146
<i>Hey, this is Fiona. Leave a message.</i>

07:28.981 --> 07:30.695
Hi

07:34.606 --> 07:37.357
- Mr. Owens?
- Yeah.

07:38.607 --> 07:42.070
John Scott from Lincoln Crematorium.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.610
May I come in?

07:56.375 --> 08:00.713
I... I know how difficult
it was for you to come to us.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.859
So I am happy to bring her to you.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.792
- Thank you.
- I'm very sorry for your loss.

08:11.892 --> 08:16.102
Mr. Owens? I... I need you to sign.

08:51.163 --> 08:53.440
Hello, sunshine.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.106
Sherwin.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.549
Get up.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.381
Sherwin.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.250
Get up.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.962
Sherwin, come on. Get up.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.572
What are you doing here?

09:28.567 --> 09:30.853
Shouldn't you be at work?

09:30.953 --> 09:32.730
Yeah.

09:39.308 --> 09:41.336
Dammit.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.056
P, seriously, can you...

09:50.156 --> 09:52.359
Yes. There we go.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.628
You need to stop smoking and drinking.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.064
It's disgusting. And you stink.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.799
Come eat.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.301
I don't know what would make you
think I want to eat.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.679
Because you haven't
in I don't know how long.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.745
What are you gonna do about the service?

10:11.845 --> 10:15.015
Seriously, P, I know you're trying
to help, but you just need to...

10:15.115 --> 10:18.885
- I'm getting 15 calls a day.
- Well, tell them to get a life.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.241
There's no fucking way.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.801
All right. I will take care of it.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.897
Just let it go. Let it go.
Just let it ring.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.275
<i>You've reached Sherwin and Fiona.
Please leave a message.</i>

10:33.666 --> 10:36.503
- It's Lucina.
- It's her mom.

10:36.603 --> 10:40.207
<i>I wanted to see if you might like
to come up here to Maine for a bit.</i>

10:40.307 --> 10:45.055
<i>I though it might do us some good.
No need to call.</i>

10:49.348 --> 10:52.085
There is nothing you could have done.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.020
Course there is.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.323
No. You did not put her in that car.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.293
- I was supposed to take care of her.
- And you did.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.729
How can you say that?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.540
And then missing her.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.756
You have the food.

11:11.854 --> 11:15.680
And there's no reason to call
Fiona's mom back. I'll deal with her.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.145
Call me if you need me.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.268
I love you.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.707
You're making this harder than it is.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.410
Should we go see her?

12:07.492 --> 12:09.117
I don't know.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.986
She tried to destroy us.

12:15.033 --> 12:17.124
We're strong.

12:33.952 --> 12:36.043
Come on.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.628
Go see your uncle.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.584
Go.

12:55.140 --> 12:58.782
- What are you doing here?
- Mom said you wanted to play.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.768
Did she?

13:16.028 --> 13:19.472
I've got a... I've got a cold.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.738
- You swapped these.
- No, I didn't.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.974
So why... where am I?

13:28.074 --> 13:30.296
- Click start.
- I just clicked start.

13:32.688 --> 13:35.115
You didn't. You're crazy.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.283
Whatever. I still win.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.639
Oh, you're right.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.525
- Can you get out of the way?
- Really, Mom?

13:45.625 --> 13:48.862
Give me a second. Give me a second.
Cleaning up after you.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.665
What happened? Hey, that's... can I?

13:51.765 --> 13:54.400
- No, you don't need this.
- P.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.541
Yes? Have some apples.

13:58.905 --> 14:01.662
What, you start the game and not tell me?

14:05.645 --> 14:08.834
Mom said not to talk about Auntie Fiona.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.941
That's okay.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.216
I'm sorry.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.789
Thanks, Jamal.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.109
- Sherwin?
- Hi.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.546
Hi. I'm Ann, Lucinda's nurse.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.749
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.823
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

17:41.306 --> 17:44.097
Lucinda is expecting you.
But she's resting now.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.300
- So she'll see you at dinner.
- Okay.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.856
I'll show you to your room.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.657
Yes, just up here.

18:05.817 --> 18:07.687
There's a bathroom right there
to your left.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.690
And there are clean towels
in there for you.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.460
- Okay.
- I need to get back to Lucinda.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.995
If you need anything, just let me know.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.885
- Thank you.
- Okay.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.151
Oh, hey.

19:58.331 --> 20:03.236
- Finding everything okay?
- Yeah. Is there anything to drink?

20:03.336 --> 20:06.058
Of course. Wine or whiskey?

20:06.158 --> 20:09.175
- Whiskey would be great.
- Whiskey? Great.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.898
- Here you go.
- Perfect.

20:14.345 --> 20:17.570
- You gonna have one?
- No, thank you.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.340
I'm so sorry.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.279
Thank you.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.115
As you know, she was just here, and...

20:29.215 --> 20:31.884
it was really good to finally meet her.

20:34.132 --> 20:37.257
- Did you like her?
- Very much.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.360
Yeah, me, too.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.797
No one should lose a child.

20:46.244 --> 20:49.069
- Or a wife.
- Of course.

21:03.628 --> 21:08.074
What is that on the... on the island
that I can see from upstairs?

21:08.174 --> 21:10.102
Oh, that's the lighthouse.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.772
It has a great story, too.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.160
What, the lighthouse?

21:19.845 --> 21:22.268
You gonna tell me the story?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.213
Sorry.

21:25.082 --> 21:28.087
Well, the lighthouse is on an island,

21:28.187 --> 21:31.958
and the caretaker was lonely,
so he married this young girl

21:32.058 --> 21:34.360
and brought her over with him.

21:34.460 --> 21:38.998
But when she had been there for a while,
she looked at him and said...

21:39.098 --> 21:40.967
there's nothing to do.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.403
So he brought her a piano.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.806
But when the boat came
with the instrument,

21:46.906 --> 21:49.742
it only had one sheet of music.

21:49.842 --> 21:53.849
And she played and played
and played that same song

21:53.949 --> 21:57.950
over and over again until he went mad.

21:58.050 --> 22:02.021
He chopped the piano with an ax,
chopped her head off,

22:02.121 --> 22:04.810
and then killed himself.

22:07.358 --> 22:10.316
I'm sorry. Was that inappropriate?

22:11.094 --> 22:12.952
Shit.

22:15.901 --> 22:19.379
- I don't know why I said that.
- No, it's okay.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.618
Hello, Mrs. Wright.

23:22.718 --> 23:26.141
Hi. Please, have a seat.

23:29.407 --> 23:32.665
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:41.853 --> 23:44.110
Here we are.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.817
This looks very nice.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.254
I'm surprised you came.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.323
Me, too.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.993
Me, too.

24:04.409 --> 24:06.866
How was your drive?

24:08.146 --> 24:10.036
Fine.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.643
Actually, everything's
excruciating right now.

24:18.189 --> 24:20.480
I'm barely myself.

24:29.901 --> 24:33.026
She was just here, and she was fine.

24:36.591 --> 24:38.482
Fine?

24:40.746 --> 24:44.037
So... what happened?

24:48.685 --> 24:52.959
Well, from what I was told,
she was in traffic changing lanes...

24:53.059 --> 24:54.894
I know that.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.508
I read what happened.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.653
Oh, I see.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.991
I don't believe it.

25:11.793 --> 25:14.714
- We sang karaoke the night before.
- Was she drunk?

25:14.814 --> 25:17.723
No. It was the middle of the day.
She was a good driver.

25:17.823 --> 25:20.217
Not that day.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.476
What was different?

25:23.956 --> 25:26.458
I don't know. It was raining.

25:26.558 --> 25:29.461
- She was rushing.
- Why?

25:29.561 --> 25:32.052
It was an accident.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.258
Excuse me.

25:36.601 --> 25:38.638
Would you like to eat with us?

25:38.738 --> 25:43.163
No, thank you. I need to get to the store
before it closes. Do you need anything?

25:43.943 --> 25:47.413
- No, thank you.
- Well, you look very tired.

25:47.513 --> 25:50.850
Maybe she should get you
some sleeping pills.

25:50.950 --> 25:54.758
- No. That's okay.
- Okay.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.428
Ann is very good.

26:02.528 --> 26:05.051
She does more than she should.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.888
Sometimes.

26:09.468 --> 26:11.694
All the time.

26:25.771 --> 26:28.688
<i>I've done all right up till now</i>

26:28.788 --> 26:33.058
<i>It's the light of day that shows me how</i>

26:33.158 --> 26:36.062
- <i>And when the night falls</i>
- <i>Be serious.</i>

26:36.162 --> 26:39.184
<i>My loneliness calls</i>

26:39.832 --> 26:43.219
<i>Oh, I wanna dance with somebody</i>

27:03.856 --> 27:07.580
- You were great.
- You were great.

27:08.726 --> 27:10.583
Baby.

27:12.864 --> 27:15.234
Suzy, could I get
another gin and tonic, please?

27:15.334 --> 27:17.169
What are you doing?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.371
- Seriously?
- Why are you drinking so much?

27:19.471 --> 27:22.274
- I thought we were having fun.
- We are having fun.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.444
- But I just don't understand.
- What, fun?

27:25.544 --> 27:27.680
- Oh, come on, Fiona.
- Just leave it.

27:27.780 --> 27:31.237
Why are you drinking so much
when we're trying to get pregnant?

27:32.183 --> 27:34.916
If I'm drinking right now,
I guess I'm not trying to get pregnant,

27:35.016 --> 27:37.490
not thinking about it.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.953
How is he today?

28:08.053 --> 28:11.893
Tired. He should have flown.

28:12.293 --> 28:14.326
He's stubborn.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.362
What makes you say that?

28:16.462 --> 28:18.230
He seems kind.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.968
- He wants something.
- Like what?

28:23.168 --> 28:25.371
Didn't you invite him?

28:25.771 --> 28:28.441
Yes. Yes.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.964
But I didn't think he'd come.

28:54.465 --> 28:56.322
Shit.

29:33.171 --> 29:38.144
- I hadn't seen her in so long. And I...
- Fiona, stop. Stop.

29:38.644 --> 29:41.314
- Can we just talk about us?
- Sherwin, what's the point?

29:41.414 --> 29:44.657
Because you're confusing things,
and you're confusing me.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.420
- I can't.
- I thought we talked about this.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.890
Didn't we have a plan?

29:51.490 --> 29:55.127
It's... it's... it's better like this.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.656
- For who?
- Please.

29:56.756 --> 30:00.032
- It's not better for me, baby.
- Sherwin. I wanna be a father.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.988
Please.

30:25.790 --> 30:28.247
What are you afraid of?

30:31.162 --> 30:33.198
<i>What are you afraid of?</i>

30:33.298 --> 30:35.573
I'm afraid of...

30:36.023 --> 30:39.761
making a child feel unwanted.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.007
- But you wouldn't.
- You don't know that.

30:42.107 --> 30:46.011
- Baby, I do.
- She's the only mother I know, Sherwin.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.936
<i>You are being so selfish right now.</i>

33:56.268 --> 33:58.537
- Is he friendly?
- Yeah. She's good.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.674
She's all right. She won't do anything.

34:02.374 --> 34:06.311
- Hi. What's his name?
- Tammy. That's her name.

34:06.411 --> 34:09.134
Hey. Hey, Tammy.

34:11.181 --> 34:12.583
- She's a good dog.
- Hi.

34:12.684 --> 34:16.022
- Sherwin.
- Uncle George.

34:16.822 --> 34:21.313
It's good of you to come.
I can't imagine it's easy.

34:31.569 --> 34:34.059
It's a horrible thing.

34:36.607 --> 34:39.098
You meant a lot to her.

34:45.382 --> 34:47.985
She tell you we went fishing?

34:48.954 --> 34:50.789
She hated fishing.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.891
Well, she probably just wanted
to get out on the lake.

34:53.992 --> 34:58.233
- And to get away from her mother.
- Well, they...

34:58.333 --> 35:03.205
if you ask me,
they're both a little dramatic.

35:04.502 --> 35:07.439
- It's wild here.
- You think?

35:07.539 --> 35:09.428
Yeah.

35:10.408 --> 35:12.664
It's home.

35:13.711 --> 35:16.181
Look what I just hung.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.916
Nice.

35:18.016 --> 35:21.820
That's gonna drive Lucinda crazy.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.189
I hope she can hear it.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.781
From her bedroom and think about me.

35:41.405 --> 35:43.709
How is she today?

35:43.809 --> 35:47.146
She's... never great in the morning.

35:49.346 --> 35:52.418
She would like to have lunch with you.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.687
Would you mind eating in her room?

35:55.787 --> 35:59.311
- Is that what she wants?
- I think so.

36:01.759 --> 36:05.130
- What?
- That's weird.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.833
- Is it?
- In her room?

36:08.233 --> 36:12.665
- Is egg salad okay?
- I make a mean egg salad.

36:13.938 --> 36:15.340
You sure?

36:15.440 --> 36:18.447
- What, that my egg salad's good?
- No, I...

36:18.877 --> 36:20.745
Great.

36:21.501 --> 36:24.182
- I'll let you know when she's ready.
- All right.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.338
Thank you.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.789
Come in.

36:48.923 --> 36:51.761
Ann said you made lunch.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.447
I don't remember hearing that you cook.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.070
They're just sandwiches.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.820
Where were you?

37:01.920 --> 37:04.756
I went for a walk down to the lake.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.613
I should have changed. I'm sorry.

37:10.027 --> 37:13.018
- It's beautiful down there.
- Yeah.

37:18.036 --> 37:21.627
- Do you... do you mind if I...
- No, no, no.

37:23.741 --> 37:27.563
Yeah, it's very...
it's very quiet down there.

37:27.713 --> 37:31.216
- How many people live here?
- In the town?

37:31.316 --> 37:34.002
- Not many.
- Yeah, I can tell.

37:34.102 --> 37:37.206
You don't mind being so isolated?

37:37.306 --> 37:40.626
I don't think of it that way.
It's peaceful.

37:41.626 --> 37:46.142
- What do you do all day?
- Right now I'm trying to eat my lunch.

37:51.202 --> 37:54.660
I always liked swimming down there.

37:56.874 --> 37:59.344
Fiona always preferred the ocean.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.546
I never understood it.

38:01.646 --> 38:05.276
- It's punishingly cold.
- Yeah, she loved the water.

38:05.376 --> 38:07.172
Yeah.

38:11.489 --> 38:15.794
I haven't run an obituary here yet.

38:15.894 --> 38:18.630
I was wondering if you'd like to write it.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.732
My sister sent one from Atlanta.
Did you get it?

38:21.832 --> 38:25.170
Probably. There's been too much mail.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.672
Well, you can modify that.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.041
Do you want to take it down to the paper?

38:30.141 --> 38:31.996
No.

38:38.581 --> 38:40.372
I...

38:40.472 --> 38:43.535
found this just before I left.

38:47.759 --> 38:51.430
- Darling.
- She never talked about cheerleading.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.999
She was only a cheerleader
for a little while.

38:54.099 --> 38:57.169
That's probably why she
didn't mention it to you.

38:58.069 --> 39:03.496
And she became embarrassed,
you know, when she found feminism.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.916
I...

39:13.436 --> 39:15.420
met George.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.240
He's a pain but attentive.

39:18.790 --> 39:23.194
Thank God he shaved that beard.
He looked like a troll.

39:26.802 --> 39:28.767
Did you tell him to shave it?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.774
I let him know it wasn't attractive.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.673
He has a nice face.

39:35.273 --> 39:37.342
Did he tell you the joke?

39:37.442 --> 39:39.711
No, he didn't... he didn't tell any jokes.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.981
- Do you wanna hear it?
- Sure.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.684
George is from here, you know.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.989
- Okay.
- Well...

39:49.589 --> 39:51.756
there was this man.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.692
We'll call him Bill.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.975
And he moved here...

39:58.075 --> 40:01.500
from another state when he was an infant.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.235
Let's say New Hampshire.

40:04.335 --> 40:07.310
And he lived to be 93.

40:07.410 --> 40:11.636
And when he died, his tombstone read...

40:11.736 --> 40:14.494
"Almost a Mainer."

40:15.580 --> 40:17.636
That's it.

40:26.752 --> 40:29.019
It's George's one joke.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.131
It's funny.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.854
I don't know about that.

40:39.303 --> 40:41.874
I hate pickles.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.777
Of course, you'd have no way
of knowing that, would you?

40:46.477 --> 40:49.334
No. Can I get you something else?

40:51.615 --> 40:54.374
Maybe cup of coffee in a bit.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.276
Thank you.

41:04.406 --> 41:06.403
I'd like dinner to be nice.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.288
Sure.

41:22.145 --> 41:24.583
We didn't need him.

41:25.783 --> 41:28.072
It's exhausting.

41:31.254 --> 41:35.527
- Need anything?
- I think I'd like a cup of coffee.

43:12.189 --> 43:14.158
Hey.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.413
I was beginning to worry
you had gotten lost.

43:21.796 --> 43:24.094
I noticed you almost finished yours, so...

43:24.535 --> 43:27.305
You didn't need to do that. Thank you.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.807
Want a drink?

43:29.907 --> 43:33.244
- Okay.
- How do you take it?

43:33.344 --> 43:35.679
I don't know. How do you take it?

43:35.779 --> 43:38.408
Usually straight.

43:39.450 --> 43:41.706
Drink every day?

43:45.655 --> 43:48.146
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:52.297 --> 43:54.999
So what are we making for dinner?

43:55.099 --> 43:57.836
No, no, no. You've done enough.

43:57.936 --> 43:59.870
What else am I doing?

43:59.970 --> 44:01.840
Okay.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.763
George brought over some fish.

44:06.610 --> 44:10.682
I think he scaled them,
but they need to be cleaned.

44:12.417 --> 44:14.052
Okay.

44:14.152 --> 44:17.488
We just open them up, gut them.

44:17.588 --> 44:20.668
- Wait, am I doing this?
- Yes, you are.

44:24.928 --> 44:26.912
You'll be fine.

44:27.012 --> 44:28.853
Outside.

44:49.453 --> 44:52.289
Ann, can I get a plate, please?

44:52.389 --> 44:54.278
Okay!

45:02.099 --> 45:04.156
Thank you.

45:06.703 --> 45:09.329
Not bad for a city boy.

45:12.743 --> 45:14.579
Okay.

45:15.279 --> 45:17.535
So heavy.

45:27.758 --> 45:31.713
Hey, Sherwin. Look at that.

45:32.630 --> 45:36.567
- Did you make it?
- Oh, no, I'm not that nice.

45:36.667 --> 45:41.406
A neighbor heard that we have a special
guest, and she made it just for you.

45:41.506 --> 45:43.562
Is it safe to eat?

45:55.953 --> 45:58.523
What happened when Fiona was here?

45:59.223 --> 46:00.882
Honey.

46:06.196 --> 46:08.586
They fought a lot.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.607
She meant well, but it's complicated.

46:16.107 --> 46:20.878
Lucinda had been through chemo,
and Fiona wasn't here to see that.

46:20.978 --> 46:23.715
It's hard to tell how sick she is.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.184
She's sick.

46:26.284 --> 46:29.388
- How sick?
- She has a lot of pain.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.057
She's tough.

46:33.157 --> 46:35.026
But...

46:36.221 --> 46:39.059
Fiona, she didn't... excuse my language...

46:39.159 --> 46:41.165
take any of Lucinda's shit.

46:41.265 --> 46:43.601
She was really upset when she came home.

46:43.701 --> 46:45.636
Yeah.

46:45.736 --> 46:49.529
Well, I imagine she knew
she'd never see her mom again.

46:50.608 --> 46:53.612
- How would she know that?
- She knew.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.367
You know.

46:58.048 --> 47:00.808
I'm sure Lucinda knew, too.

47:04.121 --> 47:06.645
She just thought it would be her.

47:23.473 --> 47:26.578
It was thoughtful of you to get some wine.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.948
It's the same bottle Fiona bought
when she was here.

47:30.048 --> 47:32.583
She said it was the only
decent wine they had.

47:32.683 --> 47:36.674
- Well, that's true.
- I guess you shared taste.

47:37.955 --> 47:40.391
That's what happens.

47:40.691 --> 47:46.497
So you seem to have a good support system
here with Ann and George.

47:46.597 --> 47:49.667
Paid help is hardly support.

47:49.767 --> 47:53.491
And my brother-in-law
just wants to get into my bed.

47:57.408 --> 47:59.764
Do you doubt it?

48:01.811 --> 48:04.082
I... no.

48:04.482 --> 48:09.508
- But at least you're not alone.
- I've been alone since Fiona left.

48:18.061 --> 48:22.987
I just don't know why she
always had to be so tight.

48:25.602 --> 48:28.073
So in control.

48:28.873 --> 48:30.842
- Control of what?
- Everything.

48:30.942 --> 48:33.912
- She always had to have her way.
- She was a strong woman.

48:34.012 --> 48:35.546
But it's not that.

48:35.646 --> 48:39.383
It's her... rigidity.

48:39.483 --> 48:41.919
Maybe she acted that way
when she felt threatened.

48:42.019 --> 48:44.555
Is my cancer threatening?

48:44.655 --> 48:47.492
She even wanted to control that.

48:47.892 --> 48:50.228
Can't remember the last time
I saw her relaxed.

48:50.328 --> 48:52.063
Well, when was the last time
you were relaxed?

48:52.163 --> 48:56.555
Well, I'm barely alive. There must be
something relaxed about that.

49:02.772 --> 49:04.629
Lucinda.

49:06.610 --> 49:08.479
What?

49:08.579 --> 49:11.236
Is there any way I can help you?

49:25.629 --> 49:30.641
This might make you smile.
I... I found this upstairs.

49:35.377 --> 49:39.296
There is... yeah, right here,
this... this part right here.

49:42.012 --> 49:44.248
My eyes aren't too good. Will you read it?

49:44.348 --> 49:46.752
Yeah, of course.

49:48.352 --> 49:53.091
"Mommy made us lunch, and Shane said,
where's the bathroom?

49:53.191 --> 49:56.782
Oh, never mind. It was just gas."

50:04.968 --> 50:07.437
When did she write that?

50:07.537 --> 50:09.928
She was probably five.

50:16.746 --> 50:19.638
She said she was trying to get pregnant.

50:23.119 --> 50:25.409
She told you that?

50:35.965 --> 50:39.504
Parenthood brings out the best in people.

50:39.704 --> 50:43.261
And... the worst.

50:48.477 --> 50:51.103
She took so much with her.

51:02.859 --> 51:05.116
I'm sorry.

52:05.154 --> 52:07.044
Lucinda?

52:12.695 --> 52:14.552
Lucinda?

52:27.210 --> 52:30.548
Lucin... Lucinda!

52:31.348 --> 52:33.417
Are you okay?

52:33.517 --> 52:37.179
Lucinda! Can you hear me?

52:37.888 --> 52:39.724
Lucinda.

52:40.124 --> 52:43.995
It's gonna be okay, okay?
I'm gonna get you to the hospital. All right?

52:44.095 --> 52:46.297
Stay away from the hospital! Stay!

52:46.397 --> 52:47.431
- Stay away!
- Okay, okay.

52:47.531 --> 52:50.034
Stay! Away from the hospital!

52:50.134 --> 52:53.104
Okay. Listen, are you hurt? Are you hurt?

52:53.204 --> 52:55.206
Are you hurt?

52:55.306 --> 52:58.142
Let's get you on the bed.

52:58.242 --> 53:00.077
Lucinda.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.079
- Oh, Ann!
- What?

53:02.179 --> 53:05.182
- Ann!
- She left. Ann left.

53:05.282 --> 53:07.984
Oh, God, please!

53:08.586 --> 53:11.454
- Oh, God!
- Lucinda.

53:12.190 --> 53:13.991
Okay.

53:14.792 --> 53:16.631
Okay.

53:17.831 --> 53:20.481
- God.
- I'm...

53:20.581 --> 53:24.488
No! What are you... what are you doing?

53:31.116 --> 53:34.813
Please! Don't leave me!
Please don't leave me!

53:34.913 --> 53:37.982
Oh, please. Oh, please don't leave me!

53:38.082 --> 53:41.685
Please don't leave me. Oh, please.

53:51.781 --> 53:54.365
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Ann?

53:54.765 --> 53:57.767
Ann, I... I need your help.

53:58.278 --> 54:01.972
- <i>Okay.</i>
- She's... she's hysterical.

54:02.372 --> 54:07.144
<i>There's a bottle of Valium on top
of the shelf right next to or in a vase.</i>

54:07.244 --> 54:09.648
<i>Give her one and she'll calm down.</i>

54:10.748 --> 54:13.717
- <i>Did you find it?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah, I've got it.

54:13.817 --> 54:17.359
- <i>I'll be right over. Try to get some sleep.</i>
- Okay.

54:18.055 --> 54:19.924
Ann!

54:20.524 --> 54:23.547
Come back!

58:12.989 --> 58:15.493
Traveling so fucking long.

58:15.593 --> 58:17.949
- We're gonna have to cut the pant leg.
- Okay.

58:19.429 --> 58:21.399
What happened?

58:21.499 --> 58:23.764
I was shot at.

58:23.864 --> 58:25.669
Shit.

58:25.969 --> 58:30.011
It's open season. I am so sorry.

58:30.111 --> 58:32.977
- Careful, please.
- All right.

58:33.577 --> 58:36.134
It's just a bad scrape.

58:37.814 --> 58:40.604
I see why she hated this place.

58:49.825 --> 58:52.015
I'm exhausted.

58:52.996 --> 58:55.220
How you feeling?

58:57.767 --> 59:02.673
You'll be okay. It'll look bad
for a couple days, but you'll be fine.

59:02.773 --> 59:06.343
Think you can hobble over
and have some tea with Lucinda?

59:06.443 --> 59:08.846
What, now?

59:09.546 --> 59:11.881
She's worried about you.

59:11.981 --> 59:14.372
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

59:24.327 --> 59:26.183
Yes?

59:28.497 --> 59:30.167
Ann said you wanted to see me.

59:30.267 --> 59:33.971
You should always be careful
when running in the country.

59:34.071 --> 59:37.708
Well, I'm not gonna be running
again anytime soon.

59:38.408 --> 59:41.545
- Here. Sit down.
- No, no. I'm gonna rest upstairs.

59:41.645 --> 59:45.436
- Please. Just hand me the pillow, please.
- No, honestly, I'm fine.

59:46.883 --> 59:49.339
Give me the pillow.

59:51.153 --> 59:53.377
Here you go.

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:07.124
- How does it feel?
- It really hurts. It's throbbing.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.111
Ann said I got you up last night.

01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:16.917
Yeah.

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.517
Are you okay?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:24.208
I feel... strange.

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.158
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:31.048
As long as you're okay.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:35.833
What are you planning
to do with her ashes?

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:38.652
Lucinda, please.

01:00:38.752 --> 01:00:42.156
Well, we don't want to have
a double funeral.

01:00:42.906 --> 01:00:45.008
I will tell you when I make up my mind.

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:49.516
- We have a plot next to her father.
- Well, she didn't want to be buried.

01:00:49.616 --> 01:00:52.683
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.852
She always wanted to be
next to her father.

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:58.173
I didn't bring her ashes. Okay?

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:02.013
I'm gonna go rest upstairs.

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:08.692
The house smells like smoke.

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.749
I was smoking on the porch.

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:15.386
Not a good time to pick up old habits.

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:20.448
Thanks for the advice.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.772
- Want some salad?
- Please.

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:41.925
We could use real plates,
even if it's just sandwiches.

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:44.662
Ann didn't want to do dishes.

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:46.797
More?

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:48.967
Thank you.

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:53.525
Your leg seems better.
You're not limping around.

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:53.641
You should...

01:03:55.049 --> 01:03:57.968
go in the living room,
be more comfortable.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:00.872
I was just on my way.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.062
Stop smoking in my house.

01:04:18.787 --> 01:04:22.312
Thank you. Thank you.

01:04:43.812 --> 01:04:46.837
This sandwich wasn't half bad.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:53.433
Sorry, what?

01:04:53.533 --> 01:04:57.889
I just said the sandwich was fine.

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:01.234
That's good.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:06.287
You really should get some sleeping pills.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:10.006
You look like you haven't slept in ages.

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.109
Well, my wife just died.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:14.578
My child died.

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:17.848
- My child.
- I know that.

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:20.937
Why do you act so pious?

01:05:22.067 --> 01:05:24.324
It's pathetic.

01:05:25.487 --> 01:05:28.025
It's a good thing you never had children.

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:32.149
Oh, I'm sure you think that. You would.

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:38.135
- Don't presume to know me.
- I can see why she never came here.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.470
She just did.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.976
- Look how that turned out.
- That wasn't my fault.

01:05:43.076 --> 01:05:44.374
- No?
- No.

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:48.278
I saw how she came back from here.
That was you.

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.848
How dare you.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.951
- Liar.
- Excuse me?

01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:56.520
I found her ashes.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.476
So what?

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:04.281
Why did you come here?

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:09.500
Trying to see what she was hiding from?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.016
The truth is...

01:06:13.116 --> 01:06:15.505
she just wanted to be different.

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:18.308
She spent her whole life trying.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.299
And you...

01:06:20.399 --> 01:06:23.804
you were just another way
to make her feel special.

01:06:23.904 --> 01:06:27.137
She always needed to feel so special.

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:31.002
You...

01:06:31.302 --> 01:06:33.723
could have been anyone.

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:04.173
- <i>Hi. Sherwin?</i>
- Hey.

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:08.745
- You forget about me?
- <i>No. You forget to call your sister?</i>

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:10.947
All right.

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:14.751
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm coming home.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.420
<i>Thank God. I've been worried about you.</i>

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.720
- Yeah. I'll call you when I'm back.
- <i>All right. Drive safe.</i>

01:10:24.452 --> 01:10:26.309
Lucinda.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.627
Lucinda.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:32.228
Morning.

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:35.031
It's afternoon, I think.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.009
You must be hungry. I...

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:40.924
I brought you a Danish.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:59.789
- How did you get here?
- Ann drove me.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:03.660
Took me all morning
to convince her to leave me.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.840
- She shouldn't have.
- I get my way, too. Sometimes.

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:14.695
I needed to see you before you left.

01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:21.498
Okay.

01:11:23.378 --> 01:11:27.270
- Can I take you home?
- I'm pretty cold.

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:34.878
I brought a photo to show you.

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:44.955
That's Carl, my husband, holding Fiona.

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:50.227
I was so young when I met him.

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:54.294
You would have liked him.

01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:56.850
He was smart, too.

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.486
I put my life on hold after Carl.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:06.109
You don't have to do that.

01:12:07.789 --> 01:12:12.362
Fiona hated me for the life I chose.

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:15.152
She certainly wouldn't want it for you.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.335
I'm not sure it's that easy.

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:22.939
No. No.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:25.242
It's not.

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.931
I couldn't do it.

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.649
But you?

01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:35.139
You...

01:12:35.239 --> 01:12:37.133
try.

01:13:33.441 --> 01:13:36.454
It should have been me...

01:13:36.554 --> 01:13:39.587
not Fiona!

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.720
I don't regret coming.

01:14:32.618 --> 01:14:35.708
- No?
- No.
