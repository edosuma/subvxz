WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:05.004
We do a dangerous job.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.800
We all knew that
when we signed up.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.718
I'm sorry.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.595
I love you, you know?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.806
You reach out
to each other.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.267
Gabriela Dawson,
will you marry me?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.603
You be there
for each other.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.858
Truck 81.
Squad Three. Ambulance 61.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.652
Always.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.988
House 51. Anyone. Report.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.210
Truck 81,
Squad Three, report!

00:44.795 --> 00:46.963
Anyone from House 51, report!

00:57.850 --> 00:59.058
Report!

01:00.310 --> 01:01.561
Severide, report!

01:03.689 --> 01:07.150
Casey, report!
Ambo 61, come in!

01:07.568 --> 01:09.694
Truck 81, Squad Three, report!

01:12.406 --> 01:15.867
Mayday! Mayday emergency!

01:15.951 --> 01:20.371
Mayday emergency!
Anyone from House 51,
report! Report!

01:24.752 --> 01:27.170
Chief! Severide here.
Roof collapsed.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.964
We'll need assistance.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.884
What the hell happened?

01:32.968 --> 01:34.927
Propane tanks
on the top floor.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.346
Squatters cooking on
an open flame.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.515
I jumped for the stairwell.
Yeah, me, too.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.560
All right, spread out,
get eyes on everyone.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.104
Hey, Casey, you copy?

01:45.898 --> 01:47.523
Yeah. Down here.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.776
You okay?

01:49.860 --> 01:50.943
I think so.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.153
All right, we're coming down.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.530
All right.
Take it down slow.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.832
You okay?

02:04.917 --> 02:06.125
Yeah.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.211
Over here!
Man down!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.508
God! Mills!

02:14.635 --> 02:15.927
Easy, easy.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.096
Come on.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.934
Easy, Mills. Easy.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.894
Got it?
Yeah.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.020
My leg!

02:26.104 --> 02:27.897
- Calm down, Mills.
- Just breathe.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.149
Let's make him a splint.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.860
Dawson, Shay, come in.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.488
Hey, Chief, Mills might have
a fractured leg.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.323
We got more of
everything coming.

02:37.741 --> 02:38.741
Can you get him out of there?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.409
I think so.
Just breathe.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.079
Any eyes on Dawson
or Shay?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.664
I can't reach them.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.457
Shay! Call out!

02:46.708 --> 02:48.292
Dawson! Shay!

02:48.377 --> 02:49.418
Let's get you outta here.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.628
All right? You ready?
Yeah.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.130
On three.
One. Two. Three, go!

02:54.883 --> 02:57.510
Dawson! Shay!

02:59.930 --> 03:01.347
Come on, Shay.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.890
Come on.

03:03.016 --> 03:07.228
One, two, three, four,
five six, seven...
Shay! Shay! Shay!

03:08.438 --> 03:10.481
Blow to the head.
Compressions.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.945
Switch on three with me.
Ready? One, two, three.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.324
Come on, Shay.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.285
Come on, Shay!

03:27.833 --> 03:29.083
Come on, Shay!

03:29.376 --> 03:32.128
No, no, no, no, no.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.547
No. No. Come on.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.340
Let's get her
to the ambulance.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.717
Gab, Gabby!
Let go of me!

03:37.801 --> 03:40.803
Hang on! Hold on! Shay.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.640
Gabby!
No! Shay!

03:46.518 --> 03:47.518
Shay!

04:02.367 --> 04:05.161
I am telling you that
you are wasting your money.
Nah.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.872
Nobody, and by nobody I
specifically mean women,

04:08.165 --> 04:10.124
care about dumb
outer space props.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.502
But this is an original
Viper worn by Dirk Benedict.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.796
At 300 bucks,
trust me, it's a steal.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.423
Listen to yourself.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.549
Hey.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.968
Hello.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.346
Hi. I'm looking
for Dawson?

04:24.473 --> 04:25.640
Ow. Oh, right.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.059
Hey, hey, Darden,
you seen Dawson yet?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.353
Yeah, let me grab her.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.939
So, where'd
you come from?

04:33.148 --> 04:34.690
Oh, originally,
Saint Louis.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.651
Ah. I meant what firehouse.

04:36.735 --> 04:40.029
Oh, right.
Logan Square. 87.

04:40.656 --> 04:41.989
Yeah, I was there a
couple of years.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.324
- Cool.
- Hey.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.534
Leslie Shay.
Yeah.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.620
Dawson, Gabriela.
Hey.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.705
Hi. I've heard, like,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.290
a million good
things about you.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.960
All lies. Come on,
I'll show you around.
Okay.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.587
So that's Cruz and Otis.

04:56.672 --> 04:57.672
They're totally
harmless, trust me.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.048
I mean, they're gonna ask
you out, but...

04:59.174 --> 05:02.551
Oh, no, no, I'm...
This is Vargas, Herrmann,
and Lieutenant Casey.

05:02.886 --> 05:03.928
Hi.
Hi.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.641
Oh, this is Leslie Shay,
the new paramedic.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.142
Great to meet you, Leslie.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.394
You can call me Shay.
Hey.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.770
Welcome to 51, Shay.
Thank you.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.689
The only advice I can
give you is

05:14.773 --> 05:16.107
don't let
Dawson drive the rig.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.401
Hey!
Hey!

05:18.902 --> 05:20.236
Seriously.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.030
So you and Casey are...

05:23.115 --> 05:24.824
What? No. No, jeez.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.075
Oh, really? You should be.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.411
...left stuff out and,
I don't know,
it's was just a thing.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.620
End of story,

05:29.705 --> 05:32.915
Manfredi ended up moving out
and I need a new roommate.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.543
Hopefully by, you know,
before next month's
rent's due.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.129
I've been looking
for a roommate.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.760
I'm serious. I just went
through a break-up thing,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.846
and we could barely
afford the place,
so I don't know.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.097
Yeah?
Whoa!

05:48.515 --> 05:49.682
Put it back in
your pants, Lieutenant.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.559
You're not my type.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.394
You never know.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.229
Do you have a vagina?

05:56.565 --> 05:58.941
I'm gay. Fully gay, yeah.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.652
And my drink's tequila.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.365
Kelly Severide.
Leslie Shay.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.318
Hey, Otis, can
I get you to do the
bank run tomorrow?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.028
I got a doohickey
at the in-laws.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.780
Yeah, Herrmann, one thing
you'll never have to

06:45.864 --> 06:48.908
worry about is asking me to
take money to the bank
for Molly's.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.327
From your lips
to God's ears.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.539
Oh-ho! Look who's here!

06:56.166 --> 06:57.458
Peter Mills!

06:57.959 --> 06:59.001
Ah!

06:59.044 --> 07:01.754
I have never been so happy
to see so many ugly faces.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.881
Oh, yeah.
I'm surprised to see you.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.383
Yeah. Cast came off,
they cleared me.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.469
Hinted I should
wait another week,

07:08.553 --> 07:09.929
but I am done
staring at ceilings.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.180
Well, maybe you should
listen to 'em.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.557
I'm 100%, Chief.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.434
I'm good as new.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.728
Great to have you back.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.107
Any word from Severide?

07:26.196 --> 07:29.031
Hey, sorry, Chief. Had an
appointment that ran long.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.033
Peter Mills!
Hey, Gabby.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.868
Hey.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.329
You good?

07:35.664 --> 07:37.039
Good as new.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.291
Cool. Well, uh, welcome back.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.173
How is she?

08:10.532 --> 08:13.576
If I have special
dietary concerns, does the

08:13.660 --> 08:15.244
kitchen take that
into account?

08:15.579 --> 08:17.621
Like, I don't
like mushrooms.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.332
Okay, I see.
We will see you then.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.919
Some of these fancier places

08:24.045 --> 08:26.463
get offended so I like to
get it out in the open.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.091
What?

08:30.302 --> 08:31.427
Nothing.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.266
Gabriela Dawson?

08:37.976 --> 08:39.768
Yeah, that's me.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.771
Sylvie Brett. I'm your
new paramedic on 61.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.026
I'm sorry.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.778
I've been
partnered with Chout.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.947
I thought that he was gonna
be assigned here permanently.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.034
I just go where they tell me.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.581
Yeah, well, welcome.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.458
Sylvie.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.920
Take a seat.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.841
Again, I'm sorry
I was late, Chief.

09:10.926 --> 09:11.926
Don't worry about it.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.344
I want to thank you,

09:13.470 --> 09:14.553
sincerely,

09:14.638 --> 09:16.931
for giving me these last
six weeks on the ambulance.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.476
I know you could've taken
your firefighter assignment

09:21.061 --> 09:23.479
and started at 105,
but this house

09:24.856 --> 09:26.315
needed stability, and you,

09:29.027 --> 09:30.527
meant the world to me.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.613
Of course, Chief. Always.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.285
So, I'm letting you know

09:39.287 --> 09:41.497
I am putting
through your paperwork

09:41.581 --> 09:43.791
so you can resume your
placement at 105.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.877
Oh, okay.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.256
Okay, good.
Thank you, Chief.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.548
Hmm.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.931
How are you doing, Gabby?

10:01.059 --> 10:02.977
I want you to know
you can talk to me.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.812
Hey there, Wallace.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.272
Chief.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.983
Hey, Chief, thank
you. I'm gonna get
back to it.

10:09.693 --> 10:10.818
Yeah.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.320
Just letting you know,
we are wheels up for
dinner at 7:30.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.488
Great.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.865
You and Donna wanna carpool
over with Trudy and me?

10:16.992 --> 10:18.867
No, we, we'll
meet you there.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.160
Groovy.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.663
One more thing.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.749
Just so it doesn't
get uncomfortable
when the bill comes,

10:25.875 --> 10:28.502
can we agree we'll
go Dutch on this one?

10:29.587 --> 10:32.464
You invited us, Mouch.
You made a big to-do
about taking us out.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.009
I know, I know,
but this is one of
those fancy,

10:35.218 --> 10:36.260
valet parking...

10:36.344 --> 10:37.761
You know what?

10:38.388 --> 10:39.513
Dutch.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.348
Excellent.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.618
Well, Wallace
had them, so.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.287
Yeah, but Capp, it's your
turn, so.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.081
Hey. You heard from
Severide?
Nada.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.625
Didn't he have
furlough stored up?

11:09.127 --> 11:12.046
A month, maybe.
That ran out a week ago.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.631
We've all left messages,
but nothing.

11:14.716 --> 11:15.924
Yeah, same.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.135
Lieutenant, we need fuel.
Yeah?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.472
Load everyone up.
Your move.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017
I've been thinking.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.186
Uh-oh.
You know Chili's?

11:27.771 --> 11:29.730
Where the blossoms
are awesome?

11:31.608 --> 11:34.026
Shay kept telling me that
they started with just

11:34.110 --> 11:37.112
one restaurant in Dallas in
an old post office building.

11:37.697 --> 11:42.659
And she'd say the only thing
that was holding Molly's
back was small thinking.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.496
And I didn't want
to listen 'cause

11:46.164 --> 11:48.791
I believed that we had
all the time in the world.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.628
So...

11:53.505 --> 11:55.339
Wait, you've been
researching this?

11:55.507 --> 11:56.840
Yeah. I have.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.719
Do you know how many
restaurants Chili's has now?

12:01.179 --> 12:02.846
Are you talking
about expansion?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.099
Darn right!

12:07.394 --> 12:08.811
Oh, boy,
here comes Welch.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.481
I hate that guy.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.733
Their whole truck stinks
to high heaven.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.485
Hey. Can it, guys.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.737
Welch.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.198
What's up, Matt?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.158
You guys come from the
Walnut Street fire?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.284
Yep.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.495
Heard the call on
the radio. How was it?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.372
It was rolling.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.249
Good.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.543
Hey, how's what's-her-name
doing?

12:33.044 --> 12:34.336
Dawson?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.215
You be sure to
send her our love.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.054
Truck 81, Truck 66,
Squad Three,

12:44.139 --> 12:46.181
Ambo 61, house fire,
5056,

12:46.266 --> 12:47.933
West Maypole Avenue.
First truck on the
scene is in charge!

12:48.017 --> 12:49.184
Go! Go!

12:49.769 --> 12:52.312
Cruz, I do not want to
get there behind these guys.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.565
On it.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.899
First on scene.
You're on RIT and
handle traffic control.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.984
We'll check things out.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.655
Bruno! Bruno.
My son Bruno!
Where is he?

13:43.740 --> 13:44.990
He's in the basement!
I couldn't get to him!

13:45.074 --> 13:47.242
Is there, is there anyone
else in there?
No, it's just the two of us!

13:47.327 --> 13:48.327
Here.
Get her out of here!

13:48.411 --> 13:49.828
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.788
We got him, we got him.
Go, go, go!

13:58.213 --> 13:59.922
Fire department! Call out!

14:03.885 --> 14:05.219
Help me!

14:05.887 --> 14:07.346
Bruno! Bruno!

14:08.640 --> 14:09.765
Can you move?

14:09.891 --> 14:11.642
Help me!
Hold on! Hold on.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.236
Need assistance
in the basement!

14:22.529 --> 14:23.946
I've got a victim down here...

14:24.113 --> 14:26.740
Help me!
Hey! Hey!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.284
I can't breathe!

14:29.536 --> 14:30.953
You're gonna be okay!

14:37.919 --> 14:39.294
Welch, over here!

14:40.421 --> 14:42.422
Let's get you outta
here, big boy.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.387
Take him up!

14:54.435 --> 14:55.978
One, two, three, lift.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.980
Step coming up, guys.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.982
You got it?
Yeah, I got it,
I got it.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.942
Yeah, switch.
Bring him
on the stretcher!

15:03.861 --> 15:05.821
One, two, three, lift!

15:06.614 --> 15:07.990
One, two, three, lift!

15:08.658 --> 15:10.117
Good.
Good.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.910
He's struggling to breathe.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.330
Sir, I'm gonna need
you to calm down, okay?

15:15.957 --> 15:17.332
I need you to try and relax.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.168
All right, I need you
to take slow, deep breaths.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.004
All right, pass me the kit.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.008
You know how to intubate
a burn victim?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.801
I do. We just
didn't have a ton of...

15:27.885 --> 15:30.679
Watch. For fire victims,

15:31.180 --> 15:33.265
they get a lot of swelling
in the trachea.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.685
So we knock them out
with Midazolam to help
secure the airway.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.313
Pushing.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.654
Okay, tube.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.203
Push past the swollen
vocal cords, can't be
gentle, can't be afraid.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.289
Let's bag him.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.543
Check for lung sounds.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.047
You're in.
Let's go.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.716
Can I drive?
You gotta earn that.

17:20.623 --> 17:21.832
Listen,

17:22.625 --> 17:23.834
thanks.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.461
That was good work.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.004
Yeah, thanks for roping in
when you were dumb

17:28.089 --> 17:29.965
enough to go into a
basement by yourself?

17:30.466 --> 17:31.800
No problem.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.553
You know I came over
here to say...

17:34.637 --> 17:36.304
Hey, Molina, I got
a question for you.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.558
You sleeping with Casey
here so I gotta be
nice to you, too?

17:40.685 --> 17:41.810
That's it!
Hey!

17:41.936 --> 17:43.019
Enough!
Yeah?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.312
Hey!

17:50.027 --> 17:52.904
You. Pack up your truck,
leave the area.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.742
Let's go!

18:00.621 --> 18:01.788
You, too.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.129
Pack up!

18:16.095 --> 18:17.179
I tried.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.306
Tommy Welch
is not my problem.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.682
You are a lieutenant
in my house,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.017
I expect better of you.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.685
I have one lieutenant
who's out AWOL and

18:23.770 --> 18:25.687
another one who can't
keep his temper in check!

18:30.485 --> 18:33.153
I need leaders in
this house, Casey.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.533
Now more than ever.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.662
I hear you. Loud and clear.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.166
I'll go find Kelly.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.754
Appreciate that.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.974
Got a victim on
the first floor,
fell down some stairs.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.142
Possible spinal injury.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.560
We're on it.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.073
Looks like a fall.
He's still breathing.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.076
Hey, Chief, can you bring
a backboard in?

19:21.452 --> 19:22.786
Looks like his neck
might be broken.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.037
Chief?

19:24.121 --> 19:25.872
Give me a C-collar.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.918
How's his airway?
Respirations are shallow.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.839
Okay, so, what do you
think? We intubate?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.592
Shay, come on.
You're gonna have

19:37.677 --> 19:39.469
to do this without me
starting next shift.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.974
No. Not yet. We'll start
with some rescue breaths.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.852
Good, and be my guest.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.735
You know, I'll never
get used...

20:02.952 --> 20:04.286
Dawson?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.330
Yo.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.667
I'm sorry, what?

20:10.960 --> 20:14.337
I was just asking
you about the chief
situation here.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.173
In Fowlerton, the chief
weighed 400 pounds

20:17.383 --> 20:19.050
and never left the firehouse.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.344
Oh, um...

20:24.682 --> 20:26.266
Yeah, no,
Boden's great.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.685
He'll be the first to
dive in and, and help out.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.896
Good to know.

20:33.816 --> 20:34.816
Hey,

20:35.318 --> 20:37.569
I understand you were
close with Leslie Shay.

20:38.529 --> 20:42.657
I just want you to know I'm
not trying to wear her shoes.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.244
Yeah.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.996
Of course.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.128
Be right back.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.550
Hey.
Hey, there.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.929
Ask me again.
Ask you what?

21:04.013 --> 21:06.806
To marry you. Ask me.
Right here. Right now.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.433
You should have
answered the first time.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.436
And have that be
a memory of that day? No!

21:11.687 --> 21:13.188
No, thanks.
I did us both a favor.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.606
Hey.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.734
You said Shay told you
we'd be great together.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.696
I choose to have that
memory of that day.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.618
The answer's yes.
The answer is always yes.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.704
I know. But I'm going
to do it right.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.458
Okay.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.628
Come here.

21:43.886 --> 21:44.970
I love you.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.263
I love you too.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.146
You're always here for me.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.142
Hey!
Hey.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.436
How you doing?
Great.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.272
Fish been biting?

22:37.732 --> 22:39.149
Jumping in the boat.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.948
Can I grab one?
Yeah, sure.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.671
So...

23:04.133 --> 23:05.550
You coming back to 51?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.309
That house is cursed, Casey.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.020
Nothing but misery and
heartbreak there.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.899
There's a guy out near
Grayslake who does
boat repairs,

23:21.859 --> 23:23.777
he said he'll sell me a
piece of his business, so...

23:25.362 --> 23:27.030
Pretty quiet up at Grayslake.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.536
All figured out, then.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.331
Yep.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.336
Well,

23:42.379 --> 23:43.671
thanks for the beer.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.715
Yeah. Come anytime.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.642
Hey, one more thing.

24:00.147 --> 24:03.024
Boden still writes down all
the calls we go on by hand.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.360
The date, the call
itself, what we did.

24:06.195 --> 24:09.197
And you know what he
writes in the column on
the far left?

24:11.492 --> 24:13.034
The lives we save.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.245
The ones that
made it out alive.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.705
That we rescued.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.880
The badges on the wall

24:26.966 --> 24:28.174
at the Academy.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.051
Andy's,

24:31.137 --> 24:32.387
Shay's,

24:33.430 --> 24:34.889
don't represent death.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.893
They represent the
lives we save.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.635
See you later.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.312
What?

25:23.272 --> 25:24.939
Oh, is that
is what we're doing?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.276
Are we being quiet?
Are we being serious?

25:32.114 --> 25:33.198
What?

25:33.324 --> 25:34.908
Fine. You want me
to say it?

25:34.992 --> 25:36.868
That girl is bad news.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.537
Front page,
big headline, bad news.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.790
It's the only kind I know.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.959
It's part of the
fun of it, you know.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.545
Who wants to go through
life without some heartbreak?

25:51.592 --> 25:52.842
Whatever.

25:53.344 --> 25:56.346
I wasn't going to say
anything. I want that
on the record.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.514
Fine. Let's make a record.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.643
A contract.
On video, so there
will be no confusion.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.522
Do you even know
how to work that thing?

26:06.607 --> 26:08.900
I am the master of
working this thing.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.321
Fine, let's do it.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.616
All right. The Contract.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.083
So how did you end
up here, Brett?

26:27.336 --> 26:29.337
Did you ever see that
movie Runaway Bride?

26:29.672 --> 26:30.838
Mmm-hmm.

26:31.173 --> 26:34.175
I was engaged to
the number one

26:34.260 --> 26:37.470
regional sod seller in all
of mid-central Indiana.

26:37.554 --> 26:38.596
Get out of here.

26:38.681 --> 26:40.807
Yes, it was that exciting.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.769
I knew Harrison forever.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.188
We went to elementary
school together.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.898
Our families knew each other.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.778
We were supposed to
get married exactly three
months ago today.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.116
I stared at that
abyss and I just

26:59.201 --> 27:00.410
couldn't pull the trigger.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.537
You left him at the altar?

27:02.663 --> 27:05.039
No, a couple of weeks before.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.918
Cold feet that ran right up
the I-65 to Chicago.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.339
So here I am.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.884
Hey, Mills.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.345
I didn't want to bother you
while you were rehabbing,

27:19.471 --> 27:21.139
but now that you're
back...
Yeah, of course.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.766
Look, I got a lead
on your paternal grandfather.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.643
He's living outside
of Chicago.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.563
Um, wow.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.398
Okay.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.067
You didn't know he was alive.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.236
No, my, my mother
told me that his side

27:35.321 --> 27:37.113
of the family
moved to Seattle.

27:37.865 --> 27:38.948
So... Wow.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.242
Yeah, well, look.
I got a family tree.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.911
It's your dad's family.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.331
Joliet?
Yeah.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.626
Oh. Thank you.
I appreciate this.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.837
What happened to your lip?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.172
Uh...

27:54.590 --> 27:55.923
It's unrelated.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.274
Can we, uh, just not
order dessert.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.526
Let's keep it short.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.570
Why?

28:18.072 --> 28:19.364
I'm not in the mood.

28:19.490 --> 28:23.951
Wallace, you need
to start reengaging
outside of work.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.292
I know that what happened
on that day was crushing,

28:31.960 --> 28:33.544
but, you know, we really
need to just...

28:33.629 --> 28:35.046
...put a guy
on the week...

28:37.549 --> 28:39.884
Hello! Oh! Look at this
power couple!

28:40.928 --> 28:42.345
Hey, Donna,
how you feeling?

28:42.471 --> 28:45.640
Ugh, like I've got two
stomachs. This kid's
gonna be an eater.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.309
Well, hopefully he'll
have your bone structure.

28:50.771 --> 28:51.979
Who would like
to see the wine list?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.856
Ah! Thank you.
Oh, I...

28:56.151 --> 28:57.485
So, guess what?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.487
I got us

29:00.072 --> 29:02.865
four tickets to Led Zeppagain.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.034
Led Zeppelin?

29:05.160 --> 29:08.621
No, not Zeppelin.
Led Zeppagain.
It's a cover band.

29:08.831 --> 29:12.708
But they kill it,
seriously. Saturday night,
what do you say?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.002
I don't know...

29:15.087 --> 29:16.462
Sounds fun!

29:19.842 --> 29:21.092
Sounds fun.

29:21.844 --> 29:24.011
I gotta hit the head. Hon,
would you get us the Barolo?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.557
Oh! Well that, that's
a little bit out of our...

29:27.641 --> 29:29.684
She's eating for two and
drinking for zero.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.644
And you know how
I get on red wine.

29:36.150 --> 29:38.109
Dinner's on us.
No arguments.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.195
Mouch.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.823
You sure one bottle is
going to be enough?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.085
Hey, fellas.

30:39.796 --> 30:40.838
Cruz and I couldn't help

30:40.923 --> 30:43.174
but overhear that you
might be looking to

30:43.926 --> 30:45.176
franchise Molly's.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.595
I believe the name
"Molly's Two" was mentioned.

30:50.516 --> 30:54.602
Look, I might have been
a bit hasty to
brush you aside

30:54.686 --> 30:56.270
when you were looking
for initial funding.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.064
You laughed in my face.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.233
Oh! That's a bit of a...
Okay, look,

31:00.317 --> 31:02.109
all that Mouch
is trying to say is,

31:02.194 --> 31:05.530
if there's gonna be
a second round of
investments, we want in.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.294
Let me get my emotional
ducks in a row here.

31:29.096 --> 31:32.014
Can we reschedule
that get-together
with your sister on Friday?

31:32.683 --> 31:34.767
Yeah, I suppose so.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.352
What's up?

31:36.812 --> 31:38.813
Antonio wants to
take me to lunch.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.982
Sure, no problem.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.151
Oh, um...

31:44.945 --> 31:47.071
Boden's getting my
transfer paperwork
started.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.199
This place will
never be the same.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.826
Yeah, I know.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.957
Truck 81, Squad Three,
Ambulance 61.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.333
Single car accident.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.561
Mills, check the front.
Okay.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.605
Newhouse, check
the driver's side.
Got it.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.109
Please! My wife...

32:27.321 --> 32:30.656
Look, we got it
under control. We're gonna
get you out of here!

32:30.741 --> 32:31.824
Yo!
Hey, I got her!

32:31.908 --> 32:33.909
She's trapped under the
water line!

32:33.994 --> 32:36.662
Hey, Mills, go take
out the back window.

32:36.747 --> 32:37.872
I got it!

32:38.040 --> 32:40.041
Hey, Capp, hand me your ax.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.336
Good?

32:56.892 --> 32:58.184
Yo! It's not enough.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.935
Help me pull it!

33:02.731 --> 33:03.939
Come on.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.027
Her leg is pinched!
It's on a grill!

33:08.779 --> 33:10.738
How we doin' on that
hydrant, Chief?

33:11.073 --> 33:12.657
They're locating the
main right now.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.200
We gotta move the vehicle
off the hydrant.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.409
Go!
Herrmann,

33:15.577 --> 33:17.078
get the jaws.
You got it!

33:20.749 --> 33:22.958
All right. Everybody line up.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.462
On my mark, we're gonna
roll this thing upright
off the hydrant.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.589
On three. One! Two! Three!

33:32.427 --> 33:34.470
Main is shutting
down the water flow!

33:46.149 --> 33:48.776
Too much trauma to the mouth.
We can't intubate.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.907
There's no cric kit!

33:57.786 --> 33:59.787
Hand me that tubing.
And a pair of scissors.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.184
I haven't seen
that one before.

34:22.269 --> 34:24.061
I'll take that
as a compliment.

34:24.438 --> 34:25.980
Where'd you learn to do that?

34:26.064 --> 34:29.191
Fowlerton, Indiana is
right along the Interstate.

34:30.152 --> 34:33.320
Lots of car accidents
and not a lot of support.

34:35.323 --> 34:36.407
Huh.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.786
Hey! Fastest way through
the loop is lower Wacker.

34:44.499 --> 34:47.501
You and Antonio have been
seeing a lot of each other.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.630
Yeah, it's, It's been a
rough patch for him, too.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.800
I know. I'm glad.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.512
Hey.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.724
He's your brother,

35:01.850 --> 35:04.852
but if you need someone
to talk to, you can
always talk to me.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.522
Yeah. Of course.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.275
You know, I'm, I'm,

35:12.569 --> 35:14.653
I'm fine. Truly.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.991
I'll see you back at
the house later.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.896
What're you
doing, Mouch?

35:49.022 --> 35:50.231
Waiting on Chief.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.733
We're supposed to
double date tonight.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.488
I think he's been taking
what happened with Shay

35:58.532 --> 36:00.115
harder than he lets on.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.494
I've been going the extra
mile to just cheer him up,

36:03.578 --> 36:04.995
keep him busy...

36:05.914 --> 36:08.040
I just saw him heading
away on the other side.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.294
Really?

36:14.005 --> 36:15.089
Huh.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.596
Donna, I can't do this.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.391
Yes, I have it,
I feel like an idiot.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.853
A Zeppelin cover
band with Mouch and Platt?

36:28.937 --> 36:30.688
Take my life, please.

36:34.109 --> 36:37.361
Well, right now I don't care
if it's the happiest
they've ever been.

36:41.491 --> 36:44.368
Yeah, you're right.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.583
Mouch!

36:52.460 --> 36:54.962
What time do you want us to
pick you and Trudy up?

36:56.548 --> 36:57.756
Really?

37:21.197 --> 37:22.281
You know,

37:23.199 --> 37:25.993
you've been coming to see
me for five straight weeks.

37:27.037 --> 37:31.332
And for five straight weeks
you've sat on that
couch and said nothing.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.963
Nobody is making
you come here.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.507
Which means that you
want to be here.

37:42.636 --> 37:44.511
Every counseling theory I know

37:45.639 --> 37:48.390
says that I should wait for
you to make the first move.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.936
That you'll tell me what
you want to tell me

37:52.020 --> 37:53.604
when you're ready to tell me.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.735
But I also know
first responders,

38:02.530 --> 38:04.156
and we're a
different breed.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.035
We have to do things

38:08.745 --> 38:10.371
whether we're ready or not.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.257
It's okay.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.677
I can wait.
We traded places.

38:30.392 --> 38:31.976
We traded places.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.563
I told her to

38:38.900 --> 38:40.734
I told her to switch with me.

38:42.779 --> 38:45.322
And she ended up
right where I was standing...

38:45.407 --> 38:46.907
Where I should have been

38:47.033 --> 38:48.575
when the beam came down.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.322
Hey.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.118
Good to have you back.

39:31.619 --> 39:32.745
Yeah.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.624
Come on. Let's do it.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.466
Her family would
definitely want
some of this stuff.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.473
I can't stay here, man.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.434
Why don't you stay
with us for a while?

39:56.102 --> 39:57.561
I got a spare bedroom.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.063
I don't know.
I don't want to...

39:59.147 --> 40:00.981
It's done.
As long as you want.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.109
Thanks.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.103
- Is it on?
- It's on.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.604
Did you turn it on?
Are you...

40:40.855 --> 40:43.107
Okay, shut...
Shut up, shut up,

40:43.191 --> 40:45.234
you idiot, this is
serious! Concentrate!

40:45.318 --> 40:48.278
All right? The Contract.
Rule number one.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.782
We promise to never get in
each other's business.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.201
Oh! Okay, I have,
I have that recorded.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.120
I know.
That's why I just said it.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.789
All right.

40:59.666 --> 41:00.874
Rule number two.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.210
No matter how much
work gets to us,

41:03.795 --> 41:04.920
we never bring it home.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.630
Good, very good.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.799
Thank you.
You know what?

41:09.175 --> 41:11.301
That thing? Here.
Give it here. Your turn.
Yeah?

41:11.386 --> 41:13.137
Okay? Give it here.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.014
All right.
Here, here.
You want some?

41:16.266 --> 41:17.808
Take some.
Sure.
All right.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.560
We should
also say that...

41:22.272 --> 41:24.148
No matter how much
life gets to us,

41:24.232 --> 41:25.190
that we shouldn't
bring it to work.

41:25.275 --> 41:28.443
Because what we do,
it's so much more
important than all this.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.320
- Fair enough.
- An addendum.

41:30.405 --> 41:31.613
Got it.

41:32.407 --> 41:33.407
Yeah.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.496
Is that it?
Any other rules?
Uh...

41:39.914 --> 41:41.415
Just one.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.083
That we...

41:43.710 --> 41:46.253
That we promise
to be there for each other,

41:47.338 --> 41:48.463
always,

41:49.757 --> 41:50.841
no matter what.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.261
Always.
Always.
