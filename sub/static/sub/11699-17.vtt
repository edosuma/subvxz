WEBVTT

00:02.912 --> 00:04.085
Yo!

00:04.533 --> 00:06.213
What are you guys doing?
That's Emma's food.

00:07.687 --> 00:09.540
Well, there's nothing
left in the fridge.

00:09.541 --> 00:11.722
And we're only eating the
stuff she makes faces at.

00:11.723 --> 00:13.211
Yeah.

00:13.212 --> 00:14.867
I mean, plus, we're just, you know,

00:14.868 --> 00:16.733
we're just too lazy to chew, so.

00:17.863 --> 00:18.964
Knock knock!

00:18.965 --> 00:21.690
Oh my God, you guys are never
gonna believe what I have.

00:21.691 --> 00:23.193
Donuts? Please say donuts.

00:24.284 --> 00:26.048
No, they're the time capsules we made

00:26.049 --> 00:28.493
in Ms. Birdsong's fifth
grade English class.

00:28.494 --> 00:30.818
Yep, they're filled with
our hopes and dreams.

00:30.819 --> 00:32.829
Ho ho ho! I loved Ms. Birdsong.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.473
She was always so full of life.

00:34.474 --> 00:35.758
What's she up to now?

00:35.759 --> 00:37.315
Well, she's dead.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.515
So, not a lot.

00:40.729 --> 00:42.519
Oh, this is so cool!

00:42.520 --> 00:44.348
My old walkie-talkie.

00:44.349 --> 00:46.658
I wanted to be able to talk
to myself in the future.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.669
Ha-ha, she made us include
a picture of the person

00:49.670 --> 00:51.148
we hoped to marry someday.

00:51.149 --> 00:53.751
Jody, Judy, Allison,

00:53.752 --> 00:55.252
Cory.

00:56.588 --> 00:58.482
Hey, I didn't know who was
gonna grow up to be hot.

01:00.258 --> 01:02.707
Well, mine... uh, no shock to anyone...

01:03.125 --> 01:04.563
was you.

01:05.839 --> 01:08.093
Never too late to make
your dreams come true.

01:08.931 --> 01:10.973
Well, that dream, like Ms. Birdsong...

01:10.974 --> 01:12.312
Is dead.

01:13.027 --> 01:14.939
Hey! My list of goals!

01:14.940 --> 01:18.025
"Become a professional hockey player."

01:18.026 --> 01:20.095
Yeah! Way to go me!

01:21.210 --> 01:23.439
All right, mine says, "go to law school

01:23.440 --> 01:26.238
And become a lawyer." Uh,
hello, dream. Meet Riley.

01:26.747 --> 01:28.662
"have my own apartment." Done.

01:28.663 --> 01:30.353
"Get married and have two boys..."

01:31.116 --> 01:32.444
What does yours say, Ben?

01:33.598 --> 01:36.522
"Knock up a stranger and
have a child out of wedlock."

01:38.396 --> 01:40.328
I didn't really do any
of the stuff on my list.

01:40.329 --> 01:42.651
Space camp... no. College... no.

01:42.652 --> 01:44.815
In fact, I didn't even finish my list.

01:45.247 --> 01:46.761
Man, I wish I could go back
in time and tell my old self

01:46.762 --> 01:48.170
to get his act together.

01:48.171 --> 01:49.289
Oh.

01:49.290 --> 01:51.310
Wanna borrow my walkie-talkie?

01:53.525 --> 01:56.566
<i>♪ It's amazing how the unexpected ♪</i>

01:56.567 --> 01:59.704

02:04.066 --> 02:05.701
I can't believe I'm such a loser.

02:05.702 --> 02:07.800
I never even finished that stupid box.

02:07.801 --> 02:10.058
Dude, it's kind of a
metaphor for your life.

02:10.059 --> 02:11.235
What are you talking about?

02:11.236 --> 02:13.001
Oh, a metaphor? It's a figure of speech,

02:13.002 --> 02:14.360
in which a word or a phrase...

02:14.361 --> 02:15.873
I know what a metaphor is.

02:16.668 --> 02:18.074
More or less.

02:18.908 --> 02:21.367
You know what? You're right.

02:21.368 --> 02:23.794
I'm a father now. I
gotta set some new goals.

02:23.795 --> 02:26.182
Yeah, for once in my life, I'm gonna
finish something that I started.

02:26.183 --> 02:28.066
That's great. What are you thinking?

02:28.067 --> 02:30.043
Go to college? Start your own business?

02:30.044 --> 02:31.375
Finish pouring me that beer?

02:32.271 --> 02:33.953
Oh, hey boys.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.628
Hey.
- Apparently, you are still alive.

02:36.629 --> 02:39.112
My phone would say otherwise.

02:40.957 --> 02:42.338
That!

02:42.339 --> 02:43.952
I'm gonna finish that.

02:44.378 --> 02:47.166
Are you sure you don't wanna
at least try junior college?

02:47.561 --> 02:48.930
Look, I like Georgie,

02:48.931 --> 02:50.423
and I think Georgie likes me too.

02:50.424 --> 02:52.987
I guess a girl goal
is better than no goal.

02:54.209 --> 02:55.452
Oh, you know what you should do?

02:55.453 --> 02:56.741
Not take relationship advice

02:56.742 --> 02:58.048
from a guy who calls his ex-girlfriend

02:58.049 --> 03:00.066
from a blocked number
just to hear her voice?

03:00.067 --> 03:01.656
Way ahead of you, bro.

03:01.657 --> 03:04.662
I don't do that anymore.
Amy and I are friends now.

03:04.663 --> 03:06.997
Oh, then you should totally say hi
to your friend who just walked in.

03:06.998 --> 03:08.368
- What's up, Amy?
- What? Amy's here? Now?

03:08.369 --> 03:10.643
Tell her you haven't seen me.
I'm not ready to be friends.

03:10.644 --> 03:12.344
Okay, relax.

03:12.345 --> 03:13.646
She's not here.

03:13.647 --> 03:15.285
But I will tell you who is.

03:15.286 --> 03:17.237
The future Mrs. Ben Wheeler.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.847
But if she wants to use her last name,

03:18.848 --> 03:20.365
that's totally cool too.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.659
Wait, what is her last name?

03:27.543 --> 03:29.065
What are you doing?

03:29.066 --> 03:30.229
I'm gonna contact Danny,

03:30.230 --> 03:31.915
and pretend I'm him from the past.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.477
Future Danny, this is past Danny, over.

03:38.530 --> 03:41.188
One day you will meet
a man named Tucker.

03:41.189 --> 03:43.352
Do everything he tells you.

03:44.139 --> 03:45.415
Give me that.

03:45.913 --> 03:48.023
Hey, past Riley, this is future Riley.

03:48.024 --> 03:50.454
Don't waste your youth on Ben Wheeler!

03:52.200 --> 03:54.689
Your youth? Please.

03:54.690 --> 03:57.259
Call me after you pluck
your first gray hair.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.500
And it's not from your head.

04:03.796 --> 04:06.200
Trust me, Riley. You're fine.

04:06.519 --> 04:07.504
No.

04:07.505 --> 04:08.923
No, I am not fine. All right?

04:08.924 --> 04:10.873
I picked the wrong future someone.

04:10.874 --> 04:13.817
God, why does love hate me
when I love love so much?!

04:16.951 --> 04:19.654
Well, why don't you
dump fifth-grade Riley,

04:19.656 --> 04:21.897
and start dating grown-up Riley?

04:21.898 --> 04:23.475
Find out what she likes.

04:23.778 --> 04:25.760
Then you can make a new list.

04:26.097 --> 04:27.891
A you list.

04:28.564 --> 04:29.902
Oh!

04:31.274 --> 04:32.846
- Date myself.
- Yeah.

04:32.847 --> 04:34.309
- Ooh, I like that.
- Yeah.

04:34.310 --> 04:35.452
You just need to get out there

04:35.453 --> 04:37.082
and find out who you are.

04:37.447 --> 04:38.588
You know, right now,

04:38.589 --> 04:40.256
I am taking this great dance class.

04:40.626 --> 04:42.341
I actually found it by mistake.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.899
I was super hungry and I saw
this place called the salsa house.

04:53.298 --> 04:54.641
Hey, guys.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.537
You would not believe
who I just talked to.

05:01.715 --> 05:03.033
<i>So remember, Emma,</i>

05:03.034 --> 05:04.609
the guy always leads.

05:04.610 --> 05:06.489
And if his hand slips
any lower than your back,

05:06.490 --> 05:07.922
call me and I'll break it.

05:09.546 --> 05:11.723
Just in time for the big finish, whoo.

05:12.483 --> 05:13.698
Ahh!

05:15.003 --> 05:16.859
She is just the cutest thing ever.

05:16.860 --> 05:18.002
Oh, thanks.

05:18.003 --> 05:19.971
If you like her, I can
show you how I made her.

05:21.804 --> 05:24.498
Now my next goal is putting her to bed.

05:24.499 --> 05:27.491
Because I am just accomplishing
goals all over the place.

05:31.843 --> 05:33.867
So, you and Ben, huh?

05:34.330 --> 05:35.578
You kids have fun tonight?

05:35.579 --> 05:37.282
Yeah, but it was just a first date,

05:37.283 --> 05:38.754
so we'll see where it goes.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.874
Well, my guess is up to the
roof to look at the stars.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.490
That's where he usually tries to close.

05:44.131 --> 05:45.883
Well, who knows?

05:46.267 --> 05:47.747
Sometimes you know right away.

05:48.771 --> 05:51.083
Oh, you have an eyelash.

05:55.907 --> 05:58.163
Sometimes it doesn't
take more than a look.

05:59.227 --> 06:00.667
You're right.

06:01.603 --> 06:03.491
Sometimes it doesn't.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.052
Make a wish.

06:10.611 --> 06:12.858
And we're back. All good?

06:12.859 --> 06:14.875
Um, great, fine! Yeah.

06:15.731 --> 06:18.642
So it's two, three, cha cha cha.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.874
Two, three, cha cha cha.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.138
Two, three, nah nah nah.

06:23.139 --> 06:24.900
Two, three, cha cha cha.

06:25.275 --> 06:27.082
I'm just trying to feel the music.

06:27.083 --> 06:28.659
Well, that's not where I keep it.

06:29.683 --> 06:31.531
Okay, everyone, take five.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.474
Take five, guys. Take five.

06:34.475 --> 06:36.226
Mrs. Wheeler! Hi!

06:36.227 --> 06:39.026
Oh my gosh. I was afraid I
hadn't found the right place.

06:39.027 --> 06:42.130
What? No. No. Wrong place.

06:42.131 --> 06:44.843
I said date you, not date me.

06:45.899 --> 06:47.434
Now we're on a double date.

06:47.435 --> 06:48.827
And you're not my type.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.458
All that stuff you said about
what I should do with me.

06:52.459 --> 06:55.363
It turns out me just like
really wanted to go dancing.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.403
Oh, hey, guys. Just
got out of tap class.

07:02.003 --> 07:04.514
Bring in da noise, bring in da Tuck.

07:04.515 --> 07:06.010
Okay.

07:06.011 --> 07:07.586
And bring in da ladies.

07:07.587 --> 07:09.090
Oh, especially that one.

07:09.091 --> 07:10.379
Hey hey...

07:10.795 --> 07:12.770
What is wrong with the two of you?

07:12.771 --> 07:17.026
If you wanna find yourself, do it at the
adult learning annex with the other losers.

07:18.163 --> 07:19.434
Mrs. Wheeler,

07:19.435 --> 07:21.218
this is really important to me.

07:21.219 --> 07:22.378
All right, don't worry.

07:22.379 --> 07:23.960
You won't even know I'm here.

07:24.352 --> 07:25.847
Well, hello.

07:25.848 --> 07:27.399
- Hi.
- I'm Vladimir.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.406
Let me show you around.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.016
- Oh.
- Mm.

07:30.576 --> 07:31.935
Okay.

07:32.983 --> 07:34.559
Better watch out, Riley.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.815
He can get pretty handsy.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.639
Look,

07:42.640 --> 07:43.830
I know you're all gung-ho

07:43.831 --> 07:45.607
about making Georgie your goal-friend,

07:45.608 --> 07:47.462
but are you sure showing up uninvited

07:47.463 --> 07:49.518
to her job is really
the right way to go?

07:49.519 --> 07:51.582
Danny, speaking as a goal-getter,

07:51.583 --> 07:53.118
I know what I'm doing, okay?

07:53.119 --> 07:54.911
Girls love surprises.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.255
Oh, there she is.

07:58.615 --> 08:00.703
There you are. Where have you been?

08:00.704 --> 08:01.942
Uh...

08:01.943 --> 08:03.254
great, you don't even speak English.

08:03.255 --> 08:05.007
Let's go. Go go go.

08:06.103 --> 08:07.439
Surprise!

08:08.087 --> 08:09.135
Ben.

08:09.951 --> 08:11.230
What are you doing here?

08:11.231 --> 08:12.702
In honor of your very first photo shoot,

08:12.703 --> 08:14.286
I have brought you some lunch.

08:14.287 --> 08:15.663
Well, maybe you can put it there,

08:15.664 --> 08:17.048
next to all the food.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.310
This is very sweet,
but you can't be here.

08:21.311 --> 08:23.287
Don't worry, okay? I promise
I won't get in the way, okay?

08:27.103 --> 08:28.591
Starting now.

08:29.119 --> 08:31.824
Ben, please, you have
to get out of here.

08:34.273 --> 08:35.288
Danny?!

08:35.289 --> 08:36.551
Oh my God. What are you doing?

08:36.552 --> 08:38.503
- He's not a model.
- You're not a model?

08:38.504 --> 08:40.222
- I'm not a model.
- I need a model.

08:40.224 --> 08:41.447
Well, the model's late.

08:41.448 --> 08:42.904
I hate models.

08:43.416 --> 08:45.135
First your crazy brother, now this.

08:45.136 --> 08:46.657
This day is a complete disaster!

08:47.585 --> 08:49.337
Well, I could do it.

08:49.689 --> 08:51.512
I mean, I'm already in costume.

08:51.513 --> 08:53.815
Plus, the photographer said
to just think about nothing.

08:53.816 --> 08:55.712
I was planning on doing
that today, anyway.

08:56.413 --> 08:57.616
You'd do that?

08:58.441 --> 08:59.752
Thank you, Danny.

09:00.056 --> 09:01.655
But don't be mad at Ben.

09:01.656 --> 09:03.072
He really likes you.

09:03.073 --> 09:04.441
When he really likes something,

09:05.184 --> 09:06.765
well, this happens.

09:06.766 --> 09:08.949
Which is quite flattering,
but, to be honest...

09:08.950 --> 09:10.757
I don't think Ben's the one for me.

09:10.758 --> 09:11.886
He's a bit of a boy.

09:12.638 --> 09:14.173
I'm looking for a man.

09:16.213 --> 09:18.756
Danny, um, I've never done this before.

09:18.757 --> 09:21.767
A photoshoot? Yeah, I can kinda tell.

09:22.504 --> 09:23.742
No.

09:23.743 --> 09:25.128
Asked a man out.

09:25.536 --> 09:27.160
Would you like to go out with me?

09:32.996 --> 09:34.156
Hey, Vladimir.

09:34.564 --> 09:36.483
I think I pulled a muscle,
and I was just wondering

09:36.484 --> 09:38.148
if maybe you could help me stretch it.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.900
I think it's my cuteius-Maximus.

09:51.188 --> 09:52.587
Okay!

09:52.588 --> 09:54.588
So, if I could get everyone's attention.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.235
We are going to be having

09:56.236 --> 09:58.235
a little charity dance competition.

09:59.325 --> 10:01.291
Oh my God, fun! Uh, perfect
way to top off my new list.

10:01.292 --> 10:02.627
With a trophy.

10:02.628 --> 10:04.908
Oh, there is a trophy, right?

10:05.917 --> 10:07.083
- Okay.
- Hey hey!

10:07.084 --> 10:08.995
This is my barre, my dance floor

10:08.996 --> 10:11.500
and my trophy, okay? So why
don't you just tap away?!

10:12.284 --> 10:13.595
Tap tap.

10:13.596 --> 10:15.163
Okay...

10:15.164 --> 10:17.826
Please find a partner and
sign up in the gift shop,

10:17.827 --> 10:19.274
next to my new DVD...

10:19.976 --> 10:21.759
Oh, God.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.543
"Not your momma's mambo."

10:27.144 --> 10:28.671
- Partner...
- Partner partner...

10:28.672 --> 10:29.767
- Tucker. Tucker!
- Tucker Tucker Tucker!

10:29.768 --> 10:31.135
Tucker Tucker! Tucker Tucker!

10:31.136 --> 10:32.895
<i>-  Dibs dibs dibs!
- Tucker!</i>

10:32.896 --> 10:34.279
He's mine.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.295
Actually, you know, I
think I'm gonna pass.

10:36.296 --> 10:37.654
I already have a partner.

10:41.399 --> 10:43.046
You know, I don't know what it is...

10:43.047 --> 10:45.608
Katrinka and I just fit
so perfectly together.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.298
Oh, you should ask Vlad.

10:51.997 --> 10:53.737
Oh my God. Vladimir, yes!

10:53.738 --> 10:54.818
Oh.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.074
I guess you should have been rushin'

10:58.562 --> 11:00.841
if you wanted the Russian.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.074

11:09.136 --> 11:10.335
Oh my God.

11:10.832 --> 11:13.967
Why does dancing hate me
when I love dancing so much?

11:16.655 --> 11:18.190
Okay, here's a surprise.

11:18.191 --> 11:20.127
Girls actually hate surprises.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.782
Is it over with Georgie?
Did she cut it off?

11:23.783 --> 11:25.744
Did she already ask someone
else out who said no?

11:26.976 --> 11:28.983
You should totally just move on, bro.

11:29.951 --> 11:32.334
Or maybe I could just figure
out what she actually does like.

11:32.335 --> 11:34.342
Wheeler, I need you. All right?

11:34.343 --> 11:36.126
I need you to help me
win a dance competition.

11:36.127 --> 11:38.207
Ooh, I'm not a very good dancer.

11:39.047 --> 11:40.343
Yeah, I know.

11:40.344 --> 11:42.127
I was actually asking your brother.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.814
Oh my God, dancing. That's perfect.

11:44.815 --> 11:46.230
Georgie would like that.

11:46.231 --> 11:47.454
All girls!

11:47.455 --> 11:49.198
All girls like dancing!

11:49.199 --> 11:51.350
Think of all the girls
you can meet dancing.

11:51.351 --> 11:52.886
Danny, I already have a girl.

11:52.887 --> 11:54.046
Do you?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.728
<i>Does anybody really ever have  anybody?</i>

11:58.216 --> 11:59.926
I mean, look at me.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.222
One day I had Amy, one day I didn't.

12:02.223 --> 12:03.584
The world is so cruel.

12:04.944 --> 12:06.262
- Tell me!
- God, leave me alone!

12:06.263 --> 12:08.126
I am not divulging my routine.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.646
Oh, I know that you are
planning an illegal lift.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.079
And I'm here to tell
you she's too top-heavy.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.344
You will never make it!

12:17.639 --> 12:19.086
You should do it, Ben.

12:19.087 --> 12:21.238
This whole Georgie thing
will work itself out.

12:21.239 --> 12:22.735
Or end, whatever.

12:27.535 --> 12:30.134
Okay, here you go! One beer.

12:30.135 --> 12:31.504
If you need anything
else, I'll be in my room.

12:32.488 --> 12:35.102
That's just information,
not an invitation.

12:35.103 --> 12:37.102
Danny, you're safe.

12:37.103 --> 12:39.735
I promise to behave
myself until Ben gets home.

12:42.984 --> 12:45.734
So, how was the photo shoot?

12:45.735 --> 12:47.933
And I lied. What do you think about us?

12:47.934 --> 12:50.668
Georgie, there is no us.

12:50.669 --> 12:52.612
I told you that I can't go out with
you as long as there's something

12:52.613 --> 12:53.972
between you and my brother.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.572
Which is why I'm here.

12:55.573 --> 12:57.789
To tell him that he's
not the one for me.

12:58.341 --> 12:59.629
But Ben really likes you.

13:01.253 --> 13:02.589
And what about you, Danny?

13:03.990 --> 13:05.310
Do you like me?

13:10.549 --> 13:11.782
Tell me you don't,

13:12.357 --> 13:13.629
and I'll go.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.669
I don't.

13:30.765 --> 13:32.005
Did you hear something?

13:32.806 --> 13:34.366
Not a thing.

13:45.171 --> 13:47.193
Hey, bro. Just got your
text. What's going on?

13:47.194 --> 13:49.757
Oh, nothing. I just got this
shooting pain in my back.

13:49.758 --> 13:51.254
Kinda feels like a knife.

13:52.535 --> 13:53.693
Is there a problem?

13:53.694 --> 13:55.277
Oh, no. No problem.

13:55.278 --> 13:57.214
Georgie's coming by. She wants to talk.

13:57.215 --> 13:58.318
And we all know what that means.

13:58.319 --> 13:59.766
What, here? Now? I should probably go.

13:59.767 --> 14:01.470
Oh, no no no no no. I
want you right by my side

14:01.471 --> 14:02.671
if she crushes my heart.

14:03.023 --> 14:05.447
You're my brother.
You always got my back.

14:05.766 --> 14:08.061
Ooh, there's that pain again.

14:08.062 --> 14:10.007
Oh, Danny, hi.

14:10.526 --> 14:12.125
I didn't know you'd be here.

14:12.126 --> 14:14.830
Well, we all know that
Danny. He gets around.

14:15.935 --> 14:17.262
So, Georgie,

14:17.263 --> 14:18.623
what'd you wanna talk about?

14:21.103 --> 14:22.741
All right. Well, um...

14:22.742 --> 14:25.405
no, I need to do this. Ben...

14:25.406 --> 14:27.614
- oh, hi, Amy.
- Yeah, right.

14:27.615 --> 14:29.086
I fell for that one once.

14:29.087 --> 14:30.423
Danny?

14:30.887 --> 14:32.303
Amy?

14:33.615 --> 14:34.989
Huh!

14:34.990 --> 14:36.783
Suddenly my back feels way better.

14:38.591 --> 14:40.837
Hey, Ben. It's me again.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.349
Hoping you're on your way.

14:42.350 --> 14:45.046
Please tell me I didn't bedazzle
my underwear for nothing.

14:45.047 --> 14:46.727
Okay, bye.

14:48.479 --> 14:49.527
Ooh, yeah.

14:50.687 --> 14:52.223
Ooh, yeah.

14:52.702 --> 14:56.278
Yeah, I stretched that one
all the way back to my teens.

14:58.151 --> 15:00.943
Which is pretty much the
last time I lost anything.

15:02.767 --> 15:06.005
Bonnie, I have terrible news.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.168
No!

15:07.648 --> 15:09.231
Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:09.232 --> 15:11.496
I... I slipped getting
out of the hot tub.

15:11.824 --> 15:13.407
You can fake it, can't you?

15:13.847 --> 15:15.632
My gay ex-husband did for years.

15:16.945 --> 15:19.201
Huh huh? Please.

15:20.393 --> 15:21.777
Aww.

15:22.696 --> 15:25.103
So sad, too bad.

15:25.104 --> 15:27.223
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit.

15:27.224 --> 15:29.014
Oh, I just feel so awful.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.447
Really?

15:32.975 --> 15:36.651
No, I don't!

15:38.556 --> 15:40.419
No!

15:40.420 --> 15:41.949
Oh my God.

15:42.268 --> 15:44.547
- Katrinka has the flu.
-  Aww.

15:44.548 --> 15:46.005
How could she do this to me?

15:46.412 --> 15:48.492
Well, you know what they say.

15:48.493 --> 15:51.004
Uh, it takes two to tango.

15:51.005 --> 15:54.355
Or mambo or any other
dance that you can't do,

15:54.356 --> 15:55.939
'cause you don't have a partner.

15:55.940 --> 15:57.340
Ka-bam!

15:58.669 --> 16:00.139
I'm sorry, I'm trying to trash talk.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.598
I'm just not very good at it.

16:04.517 --> 16:05.844
All right, fine. All right?

16:05.845 --> 16:07.893
- But we're doing my routine.
- Okay.

16:08.693 --> 16:11.123
Hey, looks like the competition

16:11.124 --> 16:12.875
is back on.

16:12.876 --> 16:14.061
Yeah.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.908
Let's do this, tiny dancer.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.855
Oh.

16:23.037 --> 16:24.539
I am so glad this isn't weird.

16:24.540 --> 16:27.019
I was just so happy when Ben
called and said you wanted to talk

16:27.020 --> 16:29.139
because I have wanted
to talk to you too.

16:29.140 --> 16:31.139
- Ben called?
- Yes. What?

16:31.140 --> 16:33.119
No, I didn't... I wasn't supposed
to tell you that. Ben who?

16:34.063 --> 16:37.406
Excuse me. There's an ass
in there I need to kick.

16:37.407 --> 16:38.559
Danny, wait!

16:38.911 --> 16:41.407
For a therapist, I really
should be better with secrets.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.838
What in the hell is the matter with you?

16:43.839 --> 16:45.014
Why would you do this?

16:45.015 --> 16:46.158
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I just thought

16:46.159 --> 16:47.622
you missed having a girlfriend
since you were spending

16:47.623 --> 16:49.222
so much time hitting on mine.

16:49.223 --> 16:50.302
I didn't hit on her.

16:50.303 --> 16:51.230
And for the record,

16:51.231 --> 16:52.710
I'm actually not your girlfriend.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.855
Not since you kissed
my brother, you're not.

16:55.576 --> 16:58.934
So, I'm a little unclear
as to why I'm here.

16:58.935 --> 16:59.974
Let me tell you why.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.478
Because my stupid brother
thought seeing my ex-girlfriend

17:02.479 --> 17:04.582
would make me break down
or fall all over her,

17:04.583 --> 17:06.374
and ruin any shot I had with Georgie.

17:06.375 --> 17:07.750
Oh, good, you got it.

17:07.751 --> 17:09.192
You can be a little slow.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.270
Oh, so you two are a couple?

17:13.271 --> 17:14.493
Well, we're trying to be.

17:14.494 --> 17:16.301
You know what? That's fine with me.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.541
Because you two lying,
backstabbing, no-lunch-eating,

17:19.542 --> 17:21.622
fire-escape-kissing
cheaters deserve each other!

17:21.623 --> 17:23.990
Well, I'm not walking away
from another woman I care about

17:23.991 --> 17:26.445
once again just to spare your feelings!

17:26.446 --> 17:27.959
What do you mean, "once again"?!

17:27.960 --> 17:30.151
And I think we're back to
why I left the first time.

17:30.921 --> 17:34.078
You don't care about anyone
else's feelings but your own.

17:34.079 --> 17:35.550
You are selfish and immature

17:35.551 --> 17:36.894
and it's not a surprise to anyone

17:36.895 --> 17:38.798
that you didn't accomplish
anything on your list!

17:38.799 --> 17:40.846
Oh, yeah? Well, you're the
worst brother in the world.

17:40.847 --> 17:42.954
You're the one who told me to go
out for Georgie in the first place.

17:42.955 --> 17:45.666
No, I didn't. That
was your own dumb idea.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.266
But of course you couldn't make it work.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.866
You don't even care about Georgie.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.259
She's just a goal to you.

17:50.595 --> 17:51.987
But she's a person to me.

17:53.652 --> 17:56.739
This might be a good time
to mention that I'm engaged.

17:58.219 --> 17:59.722
I mean, I know that it just
sounds like I'm saying that

17:59.723 --> 18:01.754
to save face, but I actually am.

18:01.755 --> 18:03.115
He's a dentist.

18:05.131 --> 18:06.462
I don't even know what to say to you.

18:06.463 --> 18:07.679
I think you've said enough.

18:08.055 --> 18:09.343
No, not enough.

18:09.887 --> 18:11.174
I'm an idiot.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.477
If you wanna go out with Georgie,

18:12.478 --> 18:14.078
then you should go out with Georgie.

18:14.534 --> 18:15.750
Danny, I'm sorry.

18:16.366 --> 18:18.693
I just wish you could have told
me how you felt about each other,

18:18.694 --> 18:20.222
and not danced around the whole...

18:20.911 --> 18:22.694
danced around?

18:22.695 --> 18:23.903
Oh my God, Riley!

18:28.422 --> 18:30.557
Amy, Georgie. Georgie, Amy.

18:30.558 --> 18:31.709
We used to date.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.414
Yeah, I kinda got that.

19:23.102 --> 19:24.286
You think anybody noticed?

19:24.287 --> 19:25.983
- Hell no, we were awesome.
- Yeah, we were.

19:29.519 --> 19:32.429
So, looks like your partner's no-show.

19:32.430 --> 19:35.134
- Yeah.
- Well, I can suit up and join you.

19:35.999 --> 19:37.702
Uh, what happened to your ankle?

19:38.632 --> 19:41.199
I don't know. Suddenly
it's feeling more better.

19:44.071 --> 19:44.991
Okay.

19:47.063 --> 19:49.025
Oh, am I too late, Riley? I'm so sorry.

19:49.026 --> 19:50.202
I just got caught up in this...

19:50.203 --> 19:51.778
well, it doesn't matter. I'm here.

19:51.779 --> 19:53.771
Uh-huh, unfortunately,
I am her partner now.

19:54.419 --> 19:55.771
You sure?

19:56.547 --> 19:59.025
For once I just really
wanna finish what I started.

19:59.026 --> 20:00.345
Yeah, but if you dance with me,

20:00.346 --> 20:01.626
you're guaranteed to win.

20:09.043 --> 20:11.299
I... I am so sorry.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.650
And, um...

20:14.082 --> 20:15.515
You dropped a button.

20:38.897 --> 20:40.073
We're pretty good together.

20:40.729 --> 20:42.257
I'm starting to believe that.

20:49.158 --> 20:50.693
Tucker, I can't tell you

20:50.694 --> 20:53.044
how grateful I am that you've
agreed to come work with me.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.372
Oh, well, you know I respect a man

20:54.373 --> 20:55.860
who knows his limitations.

20:55.861 --> 20:58.956
I must warn you that these
girls can get a little crazy.

20:58.957 --> 21:01.293
Well, you know me...
the crazier, the better.

21:01.613 --> 21:03.396
Then you'll be perfect.
Have a good class.

21:03.397 --> 21:04.718
Thanks, man.

21:05.910 --> 21:07.198
Whoo.

21:14.238 --> 21:15.453
No-o-o-o!
