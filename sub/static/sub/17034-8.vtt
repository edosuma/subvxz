WEBVTT

00:03.126 --> 00:05.733
Previously, on "Freakish."

00:05.758 --> 00:06.773
The water's out.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.554
- We have another option.
- Yeah?

00:08.664 --> 00:11.138
When they built the fallout shelter,
they stocked it with gas masks.

00:11.139 --> 00:12.444
And that's good why?

00:12.469 --> 00:15.309
Because it means we can get the masks
and the tanks and get out of here.

00:18.229 --> 00:19.991
No one has my back.

00:20.773 --> 00:21.940
That's not true.

00:21.941 --> 00:24.860
- These are all useless...
- All of them except this one.

00:25.134 --> 00:26.869
So only one of us can leave.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.219 --> 00:49.617
Okay, so only one of us can
go outside and look for help.

00:51.220 --> 00:53.305
We're drawing names.

00:53.306 --> 00:55.281
Everybody except Natalie.

00:55.975 --> 00:58.977
No. No, I don't want to
be treated differently.

00:58.978 --> 01:02.556
In your state, you'd be at a distinct
disadvantage if you go out there.

01:02.581 --> 01:03.732
He's right.

01:14.076 --> 01:15.628
Diesel.

01:20.416 --> 01:22.550
It's all right.

01:25.004 --> 01:27.636
See if we need to make any adjustments.

01:34.639 --> 01:36.367
Put it on.

01:38.226 --> 01:41.242
- Hey, is something wrong?
- Just give me a minute.

01:44.148 --> 01:47.286
I just don't like feeling closed in.

01:48.778 --> 01:50.450
You're claustrophobic?

01:50.947 --> 01:52.040
No.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.774
I'll be fine.

02:33.573 --> 02:35.657
He can't go out there.

02:35.658 --> 02:37.033
Give him a chance.

02:37.034 --> 02:38.846
We can't waste our one mask on someone

02:38.847 --> 02:41.281
who might hyperventilate
before he finds help.

02:41.306 --> 02:43.999
Come here. Dude, hey.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.959
Look, I can do this, okay?

02:45.960 --> 02:46.960
Hey.

02:49.839 --> 02:51.043
It's okay.

03:01.058 --> 03:03.356
Back to the lottery.

03:12.069 --> 03:13.570
LeSean.

03:13.571 --> 03:15.906
No. No.

03:16.477 --> 03:18.395
No, this isn't right!

03:18.677 --> 03:19.937
I'll be okay.

03:22.413 --> 03:24.456
It should be Diesel!

03:24.457 --> 03:28.698
Diesel can't do it. You
know he would if he could.

03:31.714 --> 03:33.018
I'll be all right.

03:43.075 --> 03:44.476
You sure this shit gonna protect me?

03:44.477 --> 03:47.062
About as sure as I am the gas mask will.

03:47.063 --> 03:50.398
Uh, so, thank our dependable
school security guard

03:50.399 --> 03:53.026
for keeping walkie-talkies
in his locker.

03:53.027 --> 03:55.153
Your primary goal is to
get to the fire station.

03:55.154 --> 03:56.870
If it's still there.

03:57.365 --> 03:59.157
It's the most likely
place to find people,

03:59.158 --> 04:01.576
and if not, there should
be a communication system

04:01.577 --> 04:03.703
- so you can call for help.
- And if none of that works,

04:03.704 --> 04:05.413
raid a fridge and bring
us back some water.

04:05.414 --> 04:06.748
All right, got it.

04:06.749 --> 04:08.361
Do you have your phone?

04:09.335 --> 04:11.509
- Yeah.
- Is it fully charged?

04:11.837 --> 04:13.421
Close enough.

04:13.422 --> 04:15.632
But you always say that
it's almost always dead, so.

04:15.633 --> 04:17.091
- I have it charged.
- Well, maybe we should

04:17.093 --> 04:18.551
- just be sure and check.
- Hey.

04:18.552 --> 04:20.095
He shouldn't need to
use his phone that much.

04:20.096 --> 04:22.574
- It's unlikely he'd drain his battery.
- Yeah, but what if he does?

04:22.598 --> 04:24.683
What if you find a signal
and then your phone dies?

04:24.684 --> 04:26.267
You need to go out there
with it fully charged.

04:26.268 --> 04:27.707
I'll be okay.

04:29.814 --> 04:32.357
I'm coming back. I promise.

04:32.358 --> 04:34.234
You can't promise that, you don't know.

04:34.235 --> 04:35.909
I promise.

04:47.039 --> 04:48.456
Stay strong.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.321
- Good luck, man.
- Let's do it.

05:38.650 --> 05:41.845
No! No! No!

05:44.430 --> 05:45.430
Hey!

05:45.431 --> 05:46.598
No!

05:46.599 --> 05:48.743
LeSean! There's a freak behind him!

05:48.744 --> 05:51.061
Hey, get away from him! This
way! This way! Away from him!

05:51.062 --> 05:52.854
LeSean, can you hear me?

05:52.855 --> 05:55.815
There's a freak behind you.
It's coming right behind you!

05:55.816 --> 05:58.902
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

06:19.840 --> 06:21.674
I'm afraid of spiders.

06:25.096 --> 06:27.397
Everybody has something.

06:28.390 --> 06:30.592
What if LeSean doesn't make it?

06:30.935 --> 06:32.352
Don't this to yourself.

06:32.353 --> 06:34.457
If he dies, that'll be my fault.

06:45.241 --> 06:49.548
You should focus on what you
can do, and what you've done.

06:49.573 --> 06:53.414
You've protected us... all
of us at one time or another.

06:53.415 --> 06:54.791
You built the barricades.

06:54.792 --> 06:58.086
Come on, anybody could do that.

06:58.087 --> 07:01.721
I know it sucks that LeSean
had to take your place,

07:02.417 --> 07:04.885
but there's not much
you can do about it now.

07:06.262 --> 07:09.018
Things don't always
work out the way we want.

07:13.435 --> 07:16.490
You know what I'd be doing right
now if today were a normal day?

07:17.731 --> 07:21.295
I'd be prepping for a
debate on this stage.

07:24.113 --> 07:28.658
- Think you would've won?
- The debate, yes. The election, no.

07:28.659 --> 07:31.536
- But I should've won both.
- What do you mean?

07:31.537 --> 07:35.685
I had a big list of things I wanted
to get done if I were elected...

07:35.710 --> 07:40.336
big things down to little things
like getting seating in the lobby.

07:40.337 --> 07:44.299
So when you're waiting to see the
principal, you have a place to sit.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.786
Or when you're waiting
for your ride to get you.

07:48.137 --> 07:50.013
Uh, yeah, that.

07:50.253 --> 07:52.640
It all seems so ridiculous now.

07:54.393 --> 07:56.331
Look at these seats.

07:58.063 --> 08:00.398
There might not even be
enough students left alive

08:00.399 --> 08:01.882
to fill them.

08:19.919 --> 08:21.669
Still no word?

08:21.670 --> 08:23.263
Nothing.

08:27.217 --> 08:29.021
You don't have to stay.

08:30.679 --> 08:32.304
You shouldn't be alone.

08:32.306 --> 08:34.183
I'm fine.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.731
Why haven't I heard from him?

08:41.315 --> 08:45.365
I mean, he would've radioed
by now if he could, right?

08:47.780 --> 08:51.357
Let's go upstairs. We
might get a better signal.

08:57.498 --> 08:59.678
Until we figure out how the
freaks got into the science wing,

08:59.702 --> 09:01.935
we need to assume more are coming.

09:02.294 --> 09:04.802
Want to go find some
leaks and plug 'em up?

09:05.965 --> 09:07.064
Yeah.

09:38.343 --> 09:39.593
Psst!

10:18.078 --> 10:20.485
Somebody's been sleeping here.

10:29.465 --> 10:32.142
Looks like she was attacked.

10:37.556 --> 10:39.192
Maybe bit.

10:42.895 --> 10:46.215
Okay, you tell Zoe.
I'll go find Natalie.

10:48.525 --> 10:50.401
Mrs. Viedra.

11:03.082 --> 11:04.665
Come on!

11:05.793 --> 11:07.168
Go!

11:09.004 --> 11:10.755
In here! In here!

11:10.756 --> 11:12.173
Come on, come on, come on!

11:16.637 --> 11:18.930
So now what?

11:18.931 --> 11:20.611
We figure something out.

11:34.988 --> 11:37.299
- We're doing this?
- Oh, we're doing this.

11:39.701 --> 11:40.955
Now.

11:52.881 --> 11:54.549
Oh, my God.

12:02.302 --> 12:04.308
That was my biology teacher.

12:09.231 --> 12:10.813
I had to.

12:55.777 --> 12:57.551
You waiting for a ride?

12:58.871 --> 13:01.817
You waiting to see the principal?

13:06.455 --> 13:09.749
I know you think it's a
little pointless anyway, but...

13:09.750 --> 13:10.845
No.

13:11.877 --> 13:14.795
It's really sweet. Thank you.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.802
Did you move this yourself?

13:20.886 --> 13:25.473
Yeah. Yeah, me and, uh, Lyle

13:25.474 --> 13:27.880
worked for a moving company last summer.

13:28.598 --> 13:30.641
You know, we learned all the tricks.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.730
That sounds like a hard job.

13:32.731 --> 13:37.151
Well, you know, some people in the
middle of moving get a little high strung.

13:37.152 --> 13:40.571
"Don't scratch the furniture,
don't break the china"?

13:40.572 --> 13:45.201
Yeah, don't drink the beer.
Don't take naps on the pool table.

13:45.202 --> 13:47.195
That Lyle, right?

13:47.371 --> 13:50.476
If you say so.

14:10.102 --> 14:11.310
Hello?

14:11.311 --> 14:13.864
Zoe.

14:14.731 --> 14:16.023
What took you so long?

14:16.024 --> 14:18.442
You know, too many freaks
around, I had to be quiet.

14:22.155 --> 14:24.031
I see emergency lights up ahead.

14:24.032 --> 14:27.666
Oh, my God. That's so great.

14:31.623 --> 14:33.283
I'm gonna get closer.

14:49.975 --> 14:51.925
This is really nice.

14:53.186 --> 14:54.917
Yeah.

15:02.863 --> 15:06.360
Uh, um, I'm sorry. Uh...

15:06.908 --> 15:09.577
I-I gotta go.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.672
I don't... I don't know
what I was thinking.

15:57.793 --> 15:59.710
Shit.

15:59.711 --> 16:02.588
What? What is it?

16:02.589 --> 16:04.940
Paramedics are dead.

16:15.310 --> 16:16.955
LeSean?

16:41.294 --> 16:43.637
All clear inside.

16:48.677 --> 16:51.881
- LeSean.
- I'm going for the radio.

16:53.056 --> 16:54.483
I see it.

16:56.852 --> 16:58.769
Hey!

16:58.770 --> 17:02.208
LeSean! LeSean!

17:02.899 --> 17:04.568
LeSean!

17:07.279 --> 17:08.708
LeSean?

17:10.866 --> 17:12.502
Answer me.

17:13.034 --> 17:16.871
J-just say anything. Are you there?

17:35.014 --> 17:37.631
Maybe he fought back. He's strong.

17:38.529 --> 17:41.279
We haven't heard from
him in three hours.

17:41.897 --> 17:46.216
We can stay here and
die from dehydration,

17:47.122 --> 17:50.821
or we can risk it and go out
there and find water and find help.

17:50.822 --> 17:52.083
With no masks?

17:53.084 --> 17:54.685
We're out of options.

18:00.521 --> 18:01.974
Who's in?

18:10.759 --> 18:12.194
I'm in.

18:21.195 --> 18:23.225
We stick together, right?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.140
Guys...

18:39.806 --> 18:42.250
want somebody to promise me something.

18:43.140 --> 18:46.978
If I ever turn freak or any
of that shit, you'll end it.

18:47.003 --> 18:49.374
I'll do it.

18:49.631 --> 18:51.924
Yeah, you're the one
person I know would.

18:51.925 --> 18:54.164
But seriously, I don't want
to be left out in the open...

18:54.188 --> 18:56.057
okay? I want someone to bury me.

18:57.034 --> 19:00.641
Now, that I'm not doing. Too much work.

19:00.642 --> 19:02.142
That's fair enough.

19:02.143 --> 19:06.260
Okay. When I bury you, what
do you want on your grave?

19:07.274 --> 19:08.858
Dirt.

19:08.859 --> 19:11.318
Okay. And on your headstone?

19:11.319 --> 19:12.987
I don't know, just the basics.

19:12.988 --> 19:17.560
My name, when I was born, when I died.

19:17.993 --> 19:21.310
. What would you want on your grave?

19:23.731 --> 19:27.334
His is gonna be shaped
like a... big dollar sign.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.006
No, it wouldn't.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.509
It would be several dollar signs.

19:37.053 --> 19:38.762
Oh, my God.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.569
Can I sit?

20:11.824 --> 20:14.222
I'm sorry for running off earlier.

20:15.254 --> 20:19.011
Don't worry about it. I misread things.

20:19.012 --> 20:20.785
No, but you didn't.

20:22.933 --> 20:24.754
Now I am confused.

20:27.381 --> 20:30.772
Look, I don't think you
realize the kind of person I am.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.348
I know exactly what
kind of person you are.

20:33.373 --> 20:35.268
Do you know why I was in detention?

20:37.002 --> 20:40.407
'Cause I beat the crap out of a guy,
okay? They were about to kick me out.

20:40.408 --> 20:42.636
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

20:42.714 --> 20:45.214
If we weren't stuck in here,
you wouldn't even look at me.

20:49.996 --> 20:52.544
I wouldn't have had the
chance to get to know you,

20:52.545 --> 20:54.258
so yeah, you're probably right.

20:56.023 --> 20:58.945
But you wouldn't have given
me the time of day either.

21:01.340 --> 21:02.992
We're in here...

21:05.069 --> 21:06.650
so none of it matters.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.391
I know you now.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.782
You know what, forget it.

21:20.244 --> 21:22.459
I don't want to have to
convince someone to kiss me.

21:46.224 --> 21:48.436
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.
