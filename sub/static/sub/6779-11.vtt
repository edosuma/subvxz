00:05.270 --> 00:07.591
( theme music playing )

01:53.640 --> 01:56.143
(crying )

02:01.450 --> 02:03.509
( seatbelt clicks )

02:03.620 --> 02:05.645
( keys jingle )

02:30.250 --> 02:32.673
ARE YOU STILL SURE
YOU WAN NA DO IT?

02:34.020 --> 02:36.011
REALLY?

02:36.120 --> 02:38.748
ARE YOU?

02:40.920 --> 02:43.252
I BROUGHT THE THING.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.497
THEN, YEAH.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.739
OKAY.
( sniffling )

03:06.850 --> 03:09.512
THANK YOU.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.972
( gasps )

03:44.890 --> 03:47.358
( shivering )

04:11.080 --> 04:13.275
( static on radio )

04:13.380 --> 04:15.575
Woman on radio:
...in a dark blue
Honda Accord

04:15.680 --> 04:17.887
last seen heading south
on the 101.

04:17.990 --> 04:20.515
According to officials,
the abduction took place

04:20.620 --> 04:23.157
this morning around 6:50
at a school bus stop

04:23.260 --> 04:27.026
where eyewitnesses say
that a tall caucasian man
in a hooded sweatshirt

04:27.130 --> 04:29.894
forced six-year-old
Colleen Platt into the car.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.695
( turns off radio )

04:31.800 --> 04:33.597
KEITH?

04:33.700 --> 04:35.668
- KEITH?!
- Anthony: HI.

04:35.770 --> 04:39.262
HI, COULD YOU GO GET KEITH
AND TELL HIM THAT I NEED HIM?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.507
HE AND DURRELL WENT
TO GO GET SOME DOUGHNUTS.

04:41.610 --> 04:43.100
THEY'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:43.210 --> 04:45.303
WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT
TO GET DOUGHNUTS?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.914
DU RRELL'S.
ARE YOU SICK?

04:49.020 --> 04:50.988
( gulps )

04:51.090 --> 04:52.887
NO, I'M JUST WAKING UP.

04:52.990 --> 04:55.015
MY FACE CAME OFF
LAST NIGHT.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.021
WHAT? WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY?

04:58.130 --> 05:01.327
( distorted )
MY FACE KEEPS COMING OFF
WHEN I GO TO BED.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.988
WAKE ME UP!

05:03.100 --> 05:04.897
Woman on radio:
...body of young Sarah Davis

05:05.000 --> 05:06.831
was recovered
last nIght In Fontana.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.965
Authorities had been
searching in that case

05:09.070 --> 05:12.608
for what eyewitnesses
had claimed was a dark-blue
Nissan MaXIma.

05:12.710 --> 05:15.304
But now they are saying
the two incidents are related.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.139
Man on radio:
Weather forecast...

05:17.250 --> 05:19.241
- KEITH?
- Keith: HEY.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.942
I'M GONNA TAKE
THE BOYS TO SCHOOL.

05:21.050 --> 05:24.417
OH, OKAY.
THANKS FOR...

05:24.520 --> 05:26.750
LETTING ME SLEEP.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.488
( turns off radio )

05:30.660 --> 05:32.628
HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD
ABOUT THE, UH--

05:34.100 --> 05:36.989
THEY THINK THIS
GUY'S ON THE LOOSE
OR SOMETHING?

05:37.100 --> 05:38.397
OR DID I JUST DREAM THAT?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.639
NO, I JUST SAW IT ON
THE NEWS DOWNSTAIRS.

05:40.740 --> 05:44.858
- WALK THE BOYS
INTO SCHOOL?
- SURE.

05:48.310 --> 05:50.346
( groans )

05:50.450 --> 05:52.304
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:52.420 --> 05:56.447
( sighs )
I JUST HAD A HARD TIME
WAKING UP.

05:58.750 --> 06:02.629
I'M ALL RIGHT.
IT WAS JUST A BAD DREAM
LIKE PEOPLE HAVE.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.695
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

06:08.730 --> 06:11.665
LOOK, IT'S BEEN
ALMOST SIX WEEKS SINCE...

06:13.470 --> 06:15.062
YOU KNOW.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.229
IT'S TIME, RIGHT,

06:17.340 --> 06:20.503
FOR ME TO GET IT
TOGETHER?

06:21.880 --> 06:24.371
IT'S TIME WHEN YOU FEEL
THAT IT'S TIME.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.118
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN
I DROP THE BOYS OFF.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.108
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

06:38.290 --> 06:40.326
( knocks )

06:40.430 --> 06:42.967
THAN KS FOR BREAKFAST.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.026
ANYTIME.

06:46.070 --> 06:47.367
WHAT'S THIS?

06:47.470 --> 06:49.028
IT'S MAYA'S
MEDICAL HISTORY.

06:49.140 --> 06:51.734
OH. WHERE DID YOU
FIND IT?

06:51.840 --> 06:54.809
IT SLIPPED BETWEEN THE FILES
IN THE SECOND FILE BOX.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.707
IT WAS ON THE BOTTOM
UNDERNEATH.

06:56.810 --> 06:59.779
AND I GOT THE DIRECTIONS
TO THE PEDIATRICIAN'S
NEW OFFICE.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.472
THEY'RE IN THERE
ON THE TOP.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.787
YOU'RE AMAZING.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.981
( groans )

07:07.090 --> 07:10.082
YOU WANT ME TO COME WITH?
TO THE DOCTORS?

07:10.190 --> 07:13.353
GOD, I DON'T KNOW.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.098
NO, YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'LL BE BE'I'I'ER

07:15.200 --> 07:18.897
IF THE HAND-OFF IS JUST
RUTH AND ME AND MAYA.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.888
THANKS, THOUGH.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.364
IT'LL BE GOOD TO HAVE
HER BACK IN THE HOUSE.

07:24.470 --> 07:27.075
YEAH YEAH, IT WILL.

07:28.140 --> 07:29.778
OW.

07:30.810 --> 07:32.107
CAN I?

07:32.210 --> 07:34.519
SURE.

07:35.450 --> 07:38.544
- FOOT.
- ( chuckles )

07:40.060 --> 07:41.812
SOMEBODY WANTS OUT.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.684
TWO MORE MONTHS.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.599
WOW.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.468
Claire:
I'M NOT DRUNK.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.561
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE.

07:58.670 --> 08:00.399
( toilet flushes )

08:00.510 --> 08:02.432
I'M NOT.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.110
CLAIRE, YOU FELL ASLEEP
AT YOUR DESK THIS MORNING--

08:05.210 --> 08:07.178
TWICE.
AND I CAN SMELL IT.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.784
- YOU CAN'T SMELL VODKA.
- I CAN.

08:12.620 --> 08:16.078
ANYWAY, YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE FUCKING BITCH.

08:16.190 --> 08:19.455
ALL RIGHT, CLAIRE,
WE'RE ALL REALLY SORRY

08:19.560 --> 08:21.596
- THAT YOUR BROTHER DIED.
- REALLY?

08:21.700 --> 08:25.363
YEAH, REALLY.
BUT YOU'VE BEEN
DRUNK OR HIGH AT WORK

08:25.470 --> 08:28.837
LIKE EVERY DAY
THIS WEEK AND IT'S
STARTING TO SCARE PEOPLE.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.965
I MEAN, I'VE TOLD THEM
ALL TO GIVE YOU A BREAK, BUT--

08:31.070 --> 08:34.506
WELL, THIS DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE MUCH OF
A FUCKIN' BREAK, KIRSTEN.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.771
BEING FOLLOWED
INTO THE BATHROOM

08:36.880 --> 08:39.508
AND LECTURED AT BY
SOME SCHOOLTEACHER.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.043
JUST GO HOME FOR THE DAY
AND SLEEP IT OFF, OKAY?

08:42.150 --> 08:43.344
I WON'T TELL.

08:43.450 --> 08:45.680
- YOU WON'T TELL?
- NO.

08:45.790 --> 08:48.213
- WHO WON'T YOU TELL?
- HUMAN RESOURCES.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.322
- THERE'S NO ONE TO TELL--
- I'LL TELL HUMAN RESOURCES!

08:50.430 --> 08:53.399
GOD DAMN IT!
GO! TELL, TELL, TELL!

08:53.500 --> 08:56.196
OKAY, OKAY!
I AM WICKED PISSED!

08:56.300 --> 08:57.858
YOU ARE GONNA BE
SO FIRED!

08:57.970 --> 09:00.666
YEAH, WELL,
I'M FUCKING TED.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.777
- NO WAY.
- WAY.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.577
- MARIANNE AND JOHNNY--
- DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.744
SORRY.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.157
GOD. WAY.

09:24.260 --> 09:27.855
JUST... BELONGINGS.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.021
AND I NEED YOU TO FILE
THAT FOR ME.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.030
- OKAY.
- I THINK THAT
I HAVE EVERYTHING.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.836
- YEAH, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.
COME ON.
- GOOD.

09:38.210 --> 09:41.270
YOU'RE ALL DOING REALLY
IMPORTANT WORK HERE

09:41.380 --> 09:44.406
AND I'M SORRY
IF I FUCKED IT UP
FOR ANYBODY.

09:44.510 --> 09:47.013
OKAY, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST SHUT UP
FOR A FEW SECONDS, OKAY?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.678
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- WE'RE GOING HOME.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.180
- NO, I DON'T WANNA GO HOME.
- WE'RE GOING HOME.

09:51.290 --> 09:54.350
- EVERYONE YOU
KNOW IS GONNA DIE.
- COME ON, CLAIRE.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.553
COME ON, LET'S GO.

09:56.660 --> 09:59.857
AND THAT LI'I'I'LE KIRSTEN
IS A FUCKING BITCH!

09:59.960 --> 10:02.224
CAN YOU MAKE HIM
LOOK WHOLE AGAIN

10:02.330 --> 10:04.491
FOR WHEN THE PEOPLE COME?

10:04.600 --> 10:05.999
I ALREADY HAVE A CALL
IN TO THE COMPANY

10:06.100 --> 10:08.034
THAT PROVIDES US
WITH PROSTHETIC LIMBS

10:08.140 --> 10:10.438
DESIGNED EXPRESSLY
FOR THIS PURPOSE.

10:10.540 --> 10:13.407
WE WANT HIM
TO LOOK LIKE, YOU KNOW,

10:13.510 --> 10:16.536
WHO HE WAS
AS A PERSON.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.039
NOT LIKE--

10:19.150 --> 10:22.745
PEOPLE SHOULD
SEE MORE THAN JUST
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

10:22.850 --> 10:26.479
HE'LL LOOK VERY NATURAL.
I PROMISE. AND COMPLETE.

10:26.590 --> 10:28.581
THANK YOU.

10:28.690 --> 10:31.056
CAN YOU STAND HIM
UP AND MAKE HIM WALK
AROUND TOO?

10:31.160 --> 10:33.924
OH, HOLLY, PLEASE DON'T
START THAT AGAIN.

10:34.030 --> 10:36.191
CAN MAKE HIM
MAYBE LIKE TALK
AND TELL EVERYBODY

10:36.300 --> 10:38.621
IT'S ALL GOOD
AND IT'S REALLY
NO PROBLEM TO BE DEAD?

10:38.730 --> 10:41.096
MAYBE JUST STICK
YOUR HAND UP INSIDE
HIS HEAD AND, YOU KNOW,

10:41.200 --> 10:43.236
"EVERYTHING'S FINE!
EVERYTHING'S FINE!

10:43.340 --> 10:46.002
- FREEDOM, FREEDOM, FREEDOM!"
- HOLLY, STOP IT!

10:46.110 --> 10:48.135
NO, MOM.
IF YOU DRESS PAUL UP
IN THAT UNIFORM

10:48.240 --> 10:51.175
AND PUT FAKE ARMS AND LEGS
ON HIM AND MAKE IT LOOKED
LIKE IT ALL WORKED OUT--

10:51.280 --> 10:53.942
- WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH THAT?
- IT'S NOT REAL!

10:54.050 --> 10:57.542
I DON'T CARE WHAT'S REAL!
I DON'T WANNA SEE HIM
LIKE THAT!

10:57.650 --> 11:00.687
ARE WE GONNA TELL THE PEOPLE
WHO COME TO THE FUNERAL
HE KILLED HIMSELF TOO.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.179
- ARE WE?
- NO.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.520
WITH A DRUG THAT PEOPLE USE
TO PUT DOGS TO SLEEP?

11:05.630 --> 11:09.623
- IS THAT HOW YOU WANT YOUR
BROTHER TO BE REMEMBERED?
- I SAID NO.

11:09.730 --> 11:12.938
HE GAVE HIMSELF A HYPODERMIC
OF PENTOBARBITAL.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.429
WE DON'T KNOW HOW
HE GOT A HOLD OF IT.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.838
I THINK MAYBE
A NIGHT NURSE.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.909
THEY'RE SO UNDERSTAFFED
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW

11:21.010 --> 11:23.205
THEY'RE TAKING ANYBODY.

11:23.310 --> 11:24.777
I'M SORRY.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.814
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU ALWAYS

11:26.920 --> 11:28.842
HAVE TO RUB PEOPLE'S
FACES INT.

11:28.950 --> 11:32.681
IT IS SUCH
A VIOLENT IMPULSE.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.055
Ruth:
SHOULD WE HAVE TUBES
PUT IN HER EARS?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.948
NO, IT'S A WHOLE
SURGICAL PROCEDURE

11:42.060 --> 11:44.199
UNDER GENERAL ANESTHETIC
TO PUT THOSE TUBES IN.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.463
SHE GETS THESE
EAR INFECTIONS
SO OFTEN LATELY.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.492
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.364
WELL, WE CAN
ASK THE DOCTOR
IF HE'D PUT ON

11:52.470 --> 11:55.109
A PROPHYLACTIC DOSE
OF ANTIBIOTICS FOR
A FEW MONTHS.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.599
- SEE IF THAT WOULD HELP.
- THEY DO THAT?

11:57.710 --> 11:59.405
OH, MORE AND MORE.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.308
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THOSE TUBES FALL OUT
WHEN KIDS PLAY.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.479
HOW DO YOU
KNOW ALL THIS?

12:04.590 --> 12:06.148
I, UH--

12:06.250 --> 12:08.810
I JOINED AN ONLINE
PEDIATRIC NEWS GROUP

12:08.920 --> 12:12.378
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
JUST TO KEEP UP, YOU KNOW?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.495
WHATEVER.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.228
WE'LL-- WE'LL ASK
THE DOCTOR.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.478
THANK YOU FOR COMING
WITH US THIS MORNING.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.514
MY PLEASURE.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.447
AND FOR BEING
A FRIEND LATELY.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.314
I'M GLAD I CAN HELP.

12:46.230 --> 12:49.358
I DON'T WANT TO
LET HER GO, GEORGE.
I DON'T.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.496
I KNOW.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.108
- THANK YOU, MR. DIAZ.
- OF COURSE.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.007
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
A LITTLE BEFORE 2:00.

12:59.110 --> 13:02.204
HEY, I'M SORRY
I BLEW UP IN THERE.

13:02.310 --> 13:05.746
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING
KIND OF CRAZY LATELY.

13:05.850 --> 13:08.375
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.142
I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.708
HE WAS THE ONLY BROTHER
I'LL EVER HAVE, YOU KNOW?

13:14.820 --> 13:19.223
I'LL NEVER HAVE
ANOTHER BROTHER.

13:19.330 --> 13:22.356
YEAH. BELIEVE ME,
IT WASN'T A PROBLEM.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.192
THANK YOU.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.379
DAVID?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.402
WHAT?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.808
HEY, I KNOW THIS MUST BE
A HARD TIME FOR YOU.

13:37.910 --> 13:40.413
IT'S HARD FOR ME TOO.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.613
MM-HMM, I'M SURE IT IS.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.711
BUT EVEN SO,
AT SOME POINT

13:44.820 --> 13:48.688
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO...
SIT DOWN AND TALK
ABOUT THE FUTURE

13:48.790 --> 13:51.224
OF THE BUSINESS.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.653
I AGREE.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.569
UH, DOES IT
HAVE TO BE TODAY?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.639
NO.
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.469
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

14:02.570 --> 14:05.801
THEN I DO FEEL LIKE
I NEED TO KNOW WHEN
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.935
IT'S BEEN MORE
THAN A MONTH SINCE
NATE DIED

14:08.040 --> 14:10.247
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T
EVEN TALKED AT ALL

14:10.350 --> 14:13.979
- ABOUT WHAT WE'RE
GONNA DO WITH THE BUSINESS.
- LOOK, RICO, I DON'T...

14:16.950 --> 14:19.839
KNOW WHEN I'M GOING
TO BE ABLE TO.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.814
- I'M SORRY--
- IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

14:21.920 --> 14:24.627
I GOT-- I GOT A FAMILY
I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT.

14:25.890 --> 14:28.324
SO DO I.

14:28.430 --> 14:31.319
I HAVE A FUCKING HUSBAND, RICO.
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN.

14:31.430 --> 14:36.390
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
REALIZE I'M HUMAN BEING
JUST LIKE YOU, WHEN?

14:36.500 --> 14:40.038
- WHEN?
- ( Claire and Ted
shouting )

14:43.180 --> 14:46.946
"SUPPORT OUR TROOPS"?
WHAT A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT!

14:47.050 --> 14:48.642
MISS, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.388
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
DRIVING SOMETHING

14:50.490 --> 14:53.186
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
SO MUCH GAS FOR STARTERS

14:53.290 --> 14:56.157
- IF YOU'RE
SO FUCKING CONCERNED?
- LET'S GO INSIDE. SORRY.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.080
YEAH, WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO OFFEND ANYBODY

14:58.190 --> 15:00.351
- WHILE THEY'RE
SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS!
- CLAIRE, SHUT UP!

15:00.460 --> 15:02.928
DOZENS OF FUCKING IRAQIS
ARE STILL DYING EVERY DAY!

15:03.030 --> 15:06.090
THE WHOLE WORLD HATES
US FOR GOING IN THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.896
AND TERRORISTS
ARE STILL GONNA
BE BLOWING SHIT UP

15:09.000 --> 15:11.230
IN THIS COUNTRY FOR
THE NEXT 100 YEARS.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.228
AND THE BEST THING
SHE CAN THINK TO DO
ABOUT IT IS PUT...

15:13.340 --> 15:15.479
- TAKE HER INSIDE!
- ...A STICKER ON THAT
ENORMOUS SHIT BOX!

15:15.580 --> 15:18.504
THERE WAS A DEATH
IN THE FAMILY RECENTLY.
I AM SO SORRY.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.147
THEY STILL BRING THE WOUNDED
SOLDIERS BACK AT NIGHT

15:21.250 --> 15:24.219
SO THE PRESS
CAN'T EVEN FILM IT
AND NOBODY SEES!

15:24.320 --> 15:27.050
AMERICAN SOLDIERS ARE STILL
BEING FUCKED UP EVERYDAY

15:27.160 --> 15:28.855
AND THEY DON'T
EVEN TELL US!

15:28.960 --> 15:33.954
AND IT'S ALL SO YOU
CAN PUT GAS IN THIS
ENORMOUS FUCKING CAR

15:34.060 --> 15:37.518
TO KEEP EVERYBODY FEELING
REALLY FUCKING AMERICAN!

15:37.630 --> 15:40.337
CLAIRE, SHUT THE HELL UP!
HER BROTHER JUST DIED!

15:40.440 --> 15:42.328
DAMN IT!

15:42.900 --> 15:44.629
I'M SORRY.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.235
- I AM SO SORRY,
MRS. DUNCAN.
- YOU SHOULD BE.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.342
- SHE WILL NOT
BE HERE TOMORROW.
- I SHOULD HOPE NOT!

15:50.450 --> 15:54.170
- SHE SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S ON DRUGS.
- SHE USUALLY IS.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.147
BYE-BYE.
THANK YOU.

16:05.490 --> 16:06.718
WHAT?

16:06.830 --> 16:08.252
SO WHEN CAN
WE TALK ABOUT IT?

16:08.360 --> 16:11.067
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.968
I'M SORRY, BUT I AM.
I NEED TO KNOW WHEN YOU
THINK YOU'LL BE READY

16:14.070 --> 16:16.038
- TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.
- OKAY, HERE.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.732
- HERE ARE MY KEYS.
- OH, DAVID--

16:17.840 --> 16:20.536
NO, YOU WANT THE WHOLE
FUCKING BUSINESS, RICO?
IT'S YOURS.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.040
- I JUST WANT TO HEAR
WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.
- NO, IT'S YOURS!

16:23.150 --> 16:25.505
IT'S ALL YOURS!
THERE WE HAD OUR TALK.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.457
NO ONE'S RETURNED A CALL
TO MY PHONE IN WEEKS.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.748
I CALLED BRENDA TWICE,

16:41.860 --> 16:44.522
MAGGIE SEVERAL TIMES.

16:46.270 --> 16:49.467
I GUESS NO ONE
RETURNS CALLS ANYMORE.

16:53.710 --> 16:57.043
I'VE NEVER WAITED THIS LONG
FOR A DOCTOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

16:58.380 --> 17:01.042
IT'S LIKE THIS IN MY
NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.618
THEY OVERBOOK.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.048
IT'S SO RUDE.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.014
( door opens )

17:09.120 --> 17:12.021
- OH, GOD, SORRY I'M LATE.
- MOMMY!

17:12.130 --> 17:15.588
HEY, MY SUNFLOWER!

17:15.700 --> 17:17.964
Brenda:
HOW ARE YOU, HMM?

17:18.070 --> 17:20.436
YOU GOT A SORE EAR?
LET ME LOOK.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.134
- THE DOCTOR
HASN'T BEI\'TC')\' IN YET?

17:23.240 --> 17:25.800
BUT THEY TOLD US
IT'LL BE VERY SOON.

17:25.910 --> 17:28.003
IT'S BEEN AN EXTREMELY
LONG WAIT.

17:28.110 --> 17:30.101
YEAH, WE'RE KINDA
GETTING USED TO THAT NOW.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.098
DID YOU BRING HER THINGS,
HER CLOTHES?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.776
THEY'RE ALL IN THE CAR.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.768
GREAT.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.711
- BRENDA.
- WHAT?

17:43.960 --> 17:45.723
I THINK MAYA
SHOULD STAY WITH US.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.598
- OH, REALLY?
- YES, I DO BECAUSE--

17:50.700 --> 17:53.339
- MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE TIME.
- WELL, SHE'S NOT GOING TO.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.294
YOU'RE GONNA BE VERY BUSY
ONCE THE BABY COMES.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.992
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE WITH A NEW-BORN.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.907
NO, BUT I THINK
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

17:59.010 --> 18:01.478
SHE'LL PROBABLY END UP
STAYING WITH US WHEN THE BABY
COMES ANYWAY.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.172
NO, SHE WON'T.
I HAVE BILLY STAYING
WITH ME

18:03.280 --> 18:05.043
- SO WE WILL BE FINE.
- BILLY?

18:05.150 --> 18:07.072
- YEAH.
- I'M NOT SURE THAT'S
THE BEST ENVIRONMENT.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.444
I'M NOT SURE I CARE
WHAT YOU THINK, RUTH.

18:11.150 --> 18:13.186
- I'LL GO WAIT IN THE CAR.
- OH, LOOK--

18:13.290 --> 18:14.484
- COME ON, STAY.
- NO.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.353
ANY HARDER THAN IT HAS TO BE
FOR MAYA'S SAKE?

18:19.460 --> 18:21.826
THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM ALREADY.

18:21.930 --> 18:24.694
I'M GONNA GO.
YES.

18:27.870 --> 18:30.304
( sighs )

18:36.310 --> 18:38.346
YOU ARE ABOUT TO HAVE
A BRAND-NEW BABY.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.339
HOW IS THIS ANY OF
YOUR BUSINESS, GEORGE?

18:41.450 --> 18:43.281
ANY?

18:45.020 --> 18:47.488
SHE'S ALL RUTH
HAS RIGHT NOW.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.292
SHE'S ALL RUTH HAS.

18:56.100 --> 19:00.332
Nate:
WHEREAS YOU'VE GOT YOUR ANGER,
YOUR SELF-PITY AND YOUR SPITE.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.091
ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA MAKE MAYA PAY
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE

19:03.210 --> 19:05.508
BECAUSE I FUCKED
SOMEBODY ELSE AND DIED?

19:05.610 --> 19:09.171
SHE'S BETTER OFF WITH MY MOM,
BRENDA, AND YOU KNOW IT.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.738
DR. WESTIN WILL BE WITH YOU
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

19:12.850 --> 19:15.819
- SORRY FOR THE WAIT.
- Maya: WAIT?

19:18.090 --> 19:20.149
WHAT'S THAT?

19:24.290 --> 19:26.781
OKAY, KEEP HER.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.828
DRINK.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.409
THERE.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.239
- GIVE ME MY KEYS.
- WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?

19:52.350 --> 19:54.750
TED, GIVE ME
MY FUCKING KEYS!

19:54.860 --> 19:57.112
I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU DRIVE MESSED UP
LIKE THIS SO JUST--

19:57.230 --> 20:00.791
- ( chuckling )
- WHAT?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.754
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

20:02.860 --> 20:06.762
NOTHING. I JUST NEVER
THOUGHT I'D KNOW A GUY
NAMED TED.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.801
- IT'S SUCH A '705 NAME.
- FUNNY.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.341
NOW GIVE ME MY KEYS.

20:26.450 --> 20:29.214
- NO.
- OH, GOD.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.357
FUCK! OKAY.

20:32.460 --> 20:36.556
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU.

20:36.660 --> 20:39.720
YOU ARE A FASCIST
REPUBLICAN ASSHOLE.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.628
AND THE FACT THAT
I EVER EVEN LIKED YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE

20:42.740 --> 20:46.005
IS TOTAL PROOF THAT
I AM TOTALLY FUCKED UP
ABOUT MY LIFE!

20:46.110 --> 20:48.806
SO WILL YOU
PLEASE JUST GO

20:48.910 --> 20:51.470
AND LEAVE ME ALONE?

20:54.350 --> 20:58.047
YOU LOOK REALLY
STUPID RIGHT NOW.

20:58.150 --> 21:01.415
GO, YOU FUCKING FREAK!
GET OUT!

21:02.790 --> 21:05.429
( keys jingle )

21:08.460 --> 21:10.792
I'LL BRING BACK
YOUR KEYS TOMORROW.

21:16.870 --> 21:19.338
( sighs )

21:43.260 --> 21:45.421
( elevator dings )

21:51.940 --> 21:54.079
Nate:
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR BIG MISTAKE WAS?

21:54.180 --> 21:56.501
YOU SHOULD HAVE
MARRIED BILLY.

21:56.610 --> 21:59.704
- THAT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.
- COME ON, BRENDA, HE'S
YOUR SOUL MATE.

21:59.810 --> 22:04.088
ALL I EVER WAS,
ALL ANYBODY'S EVER BEEN,
IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR BILLY.

22:04.190 --> 22:07.011
THAT WOULD BE SO EASY
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE THAT,
WOULDN'T IT?

22:07.120 --> 22:09.816
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
YOU WERE RAISED
TO BE IMPAIRED.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.151
YOU WERE GROWN WRONG
LIKE ONE OF THOSE
SQUARE WATERMELONS

22:13.260 --> 22:15.558
- THEY CULTIVATE IN JAPAN.
- ( scoffs )

22:15.660 --> 22:17.491
DON'T LAUGH AND MISS
THE SORROW OF IT.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.967
I LOVE BILLY AS MY BROTHER.
THAT IS NATURAL AND IT'S RIGHT.

22:21.070 --> 22:23.709
- UH-HUH.
- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
INCAPABLE OF HAVING

22:23.810 --> 22:26.802
ANY REAL FEELINGS
ABOUT ANY HUMAN BEING
UNLESS YOU'RE FUCKING THEM.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.708
BRENDA, LISTEN TO ME.
PACK UP YOUR STUFF,
TAKE BILLY AND GO.

22:29.810 --> 22:33.041
YOU CAN BE TOGETHER.
GO SOMEPLACE FAR AWAY
LIKE, YOU KNOW, NOVA SCOTIA.

22:33.150 --> 22:36.039
TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE MARRIED.
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW.

22:36.150 --> 22:39.586
YOU'LL LIVE TOGETHER,
YOU CAN LOVE EACH OTHER,
YOU CAN FUCK.

22:39.690 --> 22:41.715
I AM SO GLAD YOU'RE DEAD.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.584
BRENDA, I AM PRETTY SURE
THAT ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER
AND MARIA SHRIVER

22:44.690 --> 22:48.899
- ARE BROTHER AND SISTER
AND THEY'RE MAKING IT WORK.
- JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP.

22:50.030 --> 22:52.498
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU ONLY GET ONE LIFE.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.864
THERE'S NO GOD, NO RULES,
NO JUDGMENTS

22:54.970 --> 22:57.404
EXCEPT FOR THOSE YOU ACCEPT
OR CREATE FOR YOURSELF.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.809
AND ONCE IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER.

23:00.910 --> 23:03.378
DREAMLESS SLEEP
FOREVER AND EVER.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.675
SO WHY NOT BE HAPPY
WHILE YOU'RE HERE?

23:05.780 --> 23:07.839
REALLY.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.315
WHY NOT?

23:09.420 --> 23:11.081
( elevator dings )

23:13.860 --> 23:17.682
SO THEN HE CAME
BACK INSIDE, THREW
THE KEYS AT ME AND LEFT.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.951
SO DOES THAT MEAN
HE QUIT?

23:20.060 --> 23:21.596
NO, NOBODY'S QUITTING.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.328
- WHY'D YOU GIVE HIM THE KEYS?
- WE WERE FIGHTING.

23:24.430 --> 23:26.728
I WAS--
IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES

23:26.830 --> 23:28.969
WHEN PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER.
EAT SOME SALAD.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.935
- I HAD SOME.
- Durrell: YOU DID NOT.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.634
- I HAD A CUCUMBER.
- RICO DOES...

23:33.740 --> 23:35.207
WHAT?

23:35.310 --> 23:37.870
HE DOES KIND
OF HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK
FOR A SIT-DOWN, DOESN'T HE?

23:37.980 --> 23:41.279
HE-- YEAH, KEITH,
HE HAS A RIGHT.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.371
- HE IS YOUR PARTNER.
- I KNOW HE IS

23:43.490 --> 23:45.287
AND I'M NOT DENYING
HIM ANY RIGHT.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.813
- HE JUST WANTS
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.
- I KNOW.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.321
I JUST NEED SOME TIME
TO SORT THINGS OUT BEFORE
WE TALK ABOUT IT.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.988
COULD YOU TAKE MY SIDE
ON THIS, PLEASE?

23:53.090 --> 23:55.229
- I'M TAKING YOUR SIDE.
- IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

23:55.330 --> 23:58.026
I'M TAKING YOUR SIDE
BY TRYING TO HELP YOU GET
SOME PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THIS.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.859
MY BROTHER'S DEAD,
KEITH!

23:59.970 --> 24:02.564
I DON'T NEED ANYMORE
FUCKING PERSPECTIVE!

24:02.670 --> 24:04.968
I JUST NEED TO BE LOVED!

24:09.440 --> 24:11.044
OH, SHIT.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.472
THIS KEEPS
FUCKING HAPPENING.
I CAN'T--

24:14.580 --> 24:17.276
- GO TO YOUR ROOM.
- WHY?

24:17.380 --> 24:19.314
BECAUSE I TOLD YOU TO.
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

24:19.420 --> 24:21.115
- I'LL EAT SOME MORE SALAD.
- GET OUT!

24:21.220 --> 24:23.882
( sighs )
COME ON.

24:32.530 --> 24:34.430
DAVID, YOU HAVE
TO TRY AND RELAX.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.064
I'M TRYING.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.899
TRY HARDER.

24:40.110 --> 24:42.806
- IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR SIX MONTHS.
- VANESSA.

24:42.910 --> 24:46.038
- IT'S BEEN REDUCED TWICE.
- VANESSA, I KNOW THIS PLACE.

24:46.150 --> 24:48.778
I DON'T WANNA BUY IT.
IT'S CHUCK WEINGARDEN'S
OLD FUNERAL HOME.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.689
HE ALWAYS HAD WATER TROUBLE
IN THE BASEMENT.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.678
MAYBE HE'S FIXED IT
TO SELL IT.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.486
OR HE'S SELLING IT BECAUSE
HE KNOWS HE CAN'T FIX IT

24:55.590 --> 24:57.410
WITHOUT TEARING
THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.488
YOU'D HAVE TO SEE IT
TO FIND OUT, WOULDN'T YOU?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.319
RICO, OUR LIVES
SHOULD BE OURS
TO WIN OR LOSE,

25:03.430 --> 25:04.829
NOT THE FISHERS'

25:04.930 --> 25:06.818
OUR LIVES
SHOULD BE OURS.

25:06.930 --> 25:09.535
OH, DON'T SPILL THAT.
HERE.

25:09.640 --> 25:13.974
100.1-- IT'S HIGHER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.277
DOCTOR SAID THE FEVER
MIGHT LAST THROUGH THE NIGHT.

25:18.780 --> 25:22.614
SOMETIMES THE ANTIBIOTICS
TAKE A WHILE TO KICK IN.

25:24.150 --> 25:27.039
SHE'S RUBBING HER EAR
LIKE IT STILL HURTS HER.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.482
RUTH, SHE'S GETTING BETTER.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.251
DON'T WORRY.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.662
WE COULD RAISE HER,
COULDN'T WE?

25:41.300 --> 25:42.961
UM... WELL,

25:43.070 --> 25:45.334
WE'RE A LITTLE OLD,

25:45.440 --> 25:47.931
BUT YEAH, SURE.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.806
- WE COULD.
- I THINK WE COULD TOO.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.848
IT SEEMS RIGHT SOMEHOW.

25:59.690 --> 26:02.818
CAN YOU GET US
A COLD TOWEL FOR
HER FOREHEAD?

26:02.920 --> 26:05.320
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.463
Nate:
THANKS, MOM.

26:12.570 --> 26:15.494
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
TO TAKE CARE OF HER BUT YOU.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.000
I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

26:19.340 --> 26:21.205
I KNOW YOU DO.

26:23.580 --> 26:27.448
WHEN I SEE YOU TOUCH
HER FOREHEAD LIKE THAT,
I CAN FEEL IT ON MINE

26:27.550 --> 26:29.677
WHEN I WAS LITTLE

26:29.780 --> 26:33.216
IN THIS SAME ROOM
LATE AT NIGHT SITTING
BY THE BED.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.758
BEFORE CLAIRE,
BEFORE DAVID.

26:37.860 --> 26:40.693
WHEN IT WAS JUST
DAD AND YOU AND ME

26:40.800 --> 26:43.769
AND EVERYTHING WAS
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

26:48.470 --> 26:51.268
MY POOR SICK
LITTLE GIRL.

26:53.340 --> 26:57.333
I USED TO THINK
THAT I'D HAVE MORE
PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

26:57.440 --> 26:59.579
AS TIME WENT ON.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.171
IT DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.840
YEAH.

27:04.950 --> 27:07.612
I'M STARTING
TO REALIZE THAT.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.723
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
AS WE GET OLDER,

27:10.830 --> 27:14.095
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
THAT COMPLETELY GET
US SHRINKS.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.191
RIGHT.

27:17.530 --> 27:19.623
UNTIL WE BECOME SO HONED

27:19.730 --> 27:22.290
BY OUR EXPERIENCES AND...

27:23.570 --> 27:25.834
TIME AND...
(crymg )

27:25.940 --> 27:28.408
NOBODY ELSE UNDERSTANDS.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.879
( sighs )

27:35.980 --> 27:37.413
YEAH.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.215
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.413
( chuckles )
MM-HMM.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.785
- BE SURE TO TELL
THE BABY _THAT.
- ( laughing )

27:44.890 --> 27:47.256
FIRST THING RIGHT
WHEN IT COMES OUT.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.190
( radio playing )

28:30.870 --> 28:33.031
Claire:
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DIE?

28:33.780 --> 28:36.135
IT REALLY SUCKS.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.613
EVERYTHING'S UNRAVELING
SINCE YOU'RE GONE.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.314
Nate:
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:45.690 --> 28:47.988
IT FEELS THAT WAY.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.858
I MISS YOU.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.992
I MISS YOU
SO FUCKING MUCH!

29:01.500 --> 29:04.560
I MISS YOU TOO.

29:04.670 --> 29:09.232
YOU KNOW HOW I
ALWAYS USED TO TELL
YOU YOU WEREN'T DAD

29:09.340 --> 29:11.945
AFTER DAD DIED?

29:12.050 --> 29:13.403
YEAH.

29:13.510 --> 29:16.308
IT WAS SUCH A WASTE OF TIME
THINKING THAT WAY.

29:16.420 --> 29:19.048
NO, IT'S JUST PART OF
HOW YOU DEALT WITH IT,
THAT'S ALL.

29:19.150 --> 29:20.617
IT KEPT YOU FROM MISSING
DAD SO MUCH.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.154
NO, IT KEPT ME
FROM EVER KNOWING YOU

29:23.260 --> 29:25.626
AS MUCH AS I
REALLY COULD HAVE.

29:25.730 --> 29:29.393
AND NOW YOU ARE SO
COMPLETELY FUCKING GONE!

29:29.500 --> 29:30.819
IT'S-- IT'S JUST--

29:30.930 --> 29:33.069
- CLAIRE.
- WHAT?! IT SUCKS!

29:33.170 --> 29:36.492
STOP LISTENING
TO THE STATIC.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.239
WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT MEAN?

29:39.340 --> 29:41.729
NOTHING. IT JUST MEANS
THAT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD

29:41.840 --> 29:44.206
IS LIKE THIS TRANSMISSION

29:44.310 --> 29:48.178
MAKING ITS WAY
ACROSS THE DARK.

29:48.280 --> 29:51.613
BUT EVERYTHING--
DEATH, LIFE, EVERYTHING,

29:51.720 --> 29:55.156
IT'S ALL COMPLETELY
SUFFUSED WITH STATIC.

29:56.490 --> 29:59.823
( imitating static )

30:01.860 --> 30:03.259
YOU KNOW?

30:03.360 --> 30:05.760
BUT IF YOU LISTEN
TO THE STATIC TOO MUCH,

30:05.870 --> 30:08.759
IT FUCKS YOU UP.

30:08.870 --> 30:13.239
( chuckles )
ARE YOU HIGH?

30:13.340 --> 30:15.672
I AM ACTUALLY, YEAH.
I'M QUITE HIGH.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.749
YOU ARE?
(glgglmg )

30:18.850 --> 30:22.308
( animal growling )

30:22.420 --> 30:24.513
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

30:24.620 --> 30:26.042
I DON'T KNOW.

30:26.150 --> 30:28.755
( growling, snarling )

30:28.860 --> 30:32.182
- NATE, WHAT IS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:32.290 --> 30:34.690
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT
THE ENTIRE FUCKING UNIVERSE,

30:34.800 --> 30:37.155
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT
THERE RIGHT NOW, IN THE DARK?

30:37.260 --> 30:39.364
CLAIRE, YOU HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.232
NATE? NATE!

30:43.340 --> 30:45.638
( growling )

30:45.740 --> 30:48.277
- ( snarling )
- FUCK!

30:51.980 --> 30:54.278
( knocks )

30:55.580 --> 30:57.445
HEY.

30:57.550 --> 31:00.610
HI. I THOUGHT
YOU WENT TO BED.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.109
I CAN'T--

31:03.860 --> 31:05.953
SHE'S DOING SOMERSAULTS,

31:06.060 --> 31:07.925
PLAYING ON A DRUM SET.

31:08.030 --> 31:10.225
BOOM-BA-DOOM-BOOM-BOOM.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.137
( groans )

31:17.910 --> 31:19.935
CAN I FEEL?

31:20.040 --> 31:22.270
YEAH, SURE.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.946
( laughs )

31:29.050 --> 31:31.314
I LOVE YOUR BABY.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.388
MMM. THANK YOU.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.109
( sighs )

31:36.220 --> 31:38.950
I'M GONNA KIND OF MISS
HAVING HER INSIDE ME.

31:40.860 --> 31:43.556
BUT IT'LL BE REALLY NICE
TO GET MY BODY BACK.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.992
I THINK YOU
LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

31:46.100 --> 31:49.228
I DO. I'VE KNOWN YOU
EVER SINCE I WAS BORN.

31:49.340 --> 31:52.867
AND I THINK YOU
LOOK MORE PERFECT
TO ME NOW THAN EVER.

31:52.970 --> 31:55.177
- COME ON.
- WHAT?

31:55.280 --> 31:58.272
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL SHUT UP.

32:02.850 --> 32:05.387
WHAT'D YOU
DO THAT FOR?

32:07.420 --> 32:09.911
BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

32:20.470 --> 32:23.291
I LOVE YOU.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.529
I DON'T REALLY EVEN
KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY THAT.

32:30.110 --> 32:33.147
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

32:36.150 --> 32:39.347
I LOVE YOU TOO.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.689
NO-HO-HO-HO.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.951
( clears throat )

32:52.530 --> 32:54.430
CAN I HOLD YOU?

32:54.540 --> 32:57.566
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

33:06.050 --> 33:08.018
WHOA.
( laughs )

33:08.120 --> 33:10.315
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

33:10.420 --> 33:12.388
IT'S OKAY.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.685
( snickers )

33:23.600 --> 33:25.898
I NT YOU TO.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.332
DO YOU WANNA?

33:33.610 --> 33:35.737
OKAY.

33:43.250 --> 33:46.344
( moaning softly)

33:48.360 --> 33:51.523
THAT'S WHAT YOUR PENIS WOULD
LOOK LIKE IF YOU WERE A BOY.

33:53.790 --> 33:57.191
I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

34:07.810 --> 34:10.074
( sighing )

34:25.990 --> 34:29.494
( brakes squealing )

34:48.180 --> 34:50.045
"YOUR FABLED GEMINI OPTIMISM

34:50.150 --> 34:52.482
CAN BE TEMPERED WITH WISDOM

34:52.590 --> 34:54.319
AND STILL SURVIVE.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.412
GREET NEWS FROM LONG LOST
FRIENDS WITH SUSPICION.

34:58.690 --> 35:01.193
YOU HAVE MORE ENEMIES
THAN YOU THINK."

35:01.300 --> 35:04.098
HUH. OKAY.
LET'S READ GRANDPA'S.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.623
"ARIES, THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAY,

35:06.730 --> 35:09.767
BEFORE YOU SPEAK."

35:09.870 --> 35:12.839
- CLAIRE'S NOT IN
THE COAECISI?HOUSE.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.828
SHE PROBABLY STAYED AT--

35:14.940 --> 35:16.908
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
TOM'S.

35:17.010 --> 35:19.899
TED. SHE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER CELL PHONE.

35:20.010 --> 35:22.217
WELL, IT'S NOT EVEN 8:00.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.185
THEY'RE YOUNG.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.850
THEY SLEEP. AND THEY
DON'T CALL BACK.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.817
GEORGE, I MISSED
SAYING GOODBYE TO MY SON.
I'M NOT GOING TO MISS--

35:29.920 --> 35:33.754
- RUTH...
- I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE MY DAUGHTER IS!

35:37.100 --> 35:39.318
- ( school bell ringing )
- David: IF YOU GO
OUT FOR RECESS

35:39.430 --> 35:42.069
YOU STAY ON
THE SCHOOL GROUNDS.
YOU DON'T WANDER OFF.

35:42.170 --> 35:45.139
AND I'LL BE WAITING
OUTSIDE THE PRINCIPAL'S
OFFICE INSIDE THE BUILDING

35:45.240 --> 35:47.128
TO PICK YOU UP AT THE END
OF THE DAY, YOU GOT IT?

35:47.240 --> 35:51.301
- WE GET IT. LET'S GO.
- BOYS! COME HERE.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.216
I AM SORRY I GOT UPSET
AND USED BAD LANGUAGE
AT DINNER LAST NIGHT.

35:57.320 --> 36:01.188
- THAT WAS NOT RIGHT.
- CAN WE MAKE PIZZA TONIGHT?

36:02.790 --> 36:05.725
SURE.

36:05.830 --> 36:09.391
I, UM...

36:09.500 --> 36:12.560
I JUST MISS YOUR UNCLE NATE
A LOT RIGHT NOW, YOU GUYS.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.735
A LOT.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.765
AND-- AND IT'S BEEN
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE TO MOVE ON.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.100
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

36:22.210 --> 36:25.543
OH. OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
GOOD BOY, GO AHEAD.

36:26.850 --> 36:29.341
HAVE A GOOD DAY!

36:41.300 --> 36:44.758
- EXCUSE ME!
DID YOU SEE THAT?
- WHAT?

36:44.870 --> 36:47.668
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE
THE DARK BLUE NISSAN
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

36:47.770 --> 36:50.238
THE GUY WHO'S
MURDERING CHILDREN.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.501
THAT CAR'S NOT BLUE,
IT'S BLACK.

36:54.710 --> 36:57.406
OH. SORRY.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.416
MY MISTAKE.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.424
YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT
ME TO MOVE OUT?

37:13.530 --> 37:15.498
IT'S NOT LIKE
A REJECTION OR ANYTHING.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.352
I KNOW THAT.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.599
MAYA WILL NEED A ROOM.

37:19.700 --> 37:22.089
YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE
LIFE TO GET BACK TO.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.191
I GET ALL THAT,
I DO, I JUST...

37:24.310 --> 37:27.199
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY
WHEN THE BABY COMES?

37:27.310 --> 37:29.232
( scoffs )
NO.

37:29.340 --> 37:30.932
NOT AT ALL.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.804
_ 50--
- BILLY, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT WHEN THE BABY COMES

37:33.910 --> 37:36.913
YOU WON'T BE
HERE 18 HOURS A DAY.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT...

37:38.420 --> 37:41.651
I GOTTA GET MY FUCKING
SHIT TOGETHER. AND...

37:41.760 --> 37:43.853
WE NEED THE SPACE.

37:46.290 --> 37:51.489
- SO, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA PICK HER UP?
- THIS AFTERNOON.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.262
( groans )
WHY THE FUCK DID I TELL
THEM THEY COULD KEEP HER?

37:54.370 --> 37:57.828
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF
UP, JUST GO GET HER.
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

37:57.940 --> 38:00.761
YOU'RE THE BEST MOTHER
SHE COULD HAVE.

38:03.140 --> 38:05.074
ALL RIGHT.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.398
I'M GONNA GO
PACK MY SHIT UP.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.830
SHIT!

38:33.240 --> 38:36.698
( car approaching )

38:36.810 --> 38:38.539
OH, FINALLY.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.414
STOP.
( whimpers )

38:51.160 --> 38:53.424
( screams )
WHAT THE FUCK?!

38:53.530 --> 38:56.055
- I'M NOT DEAD!
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT--

38:56.160 --> 38:59.061
- I'M SORRY.
I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR--
- KILL ME!

38:59.170 --> 39:02.469
KILL ME, WHOEVER
THE FUCK YOU ARE! KILL ME!
I WANTED TO DIE. PLEASE!

39:02.570 --> 39:05.038
- THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.
- KILL ME, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

39:05.140 --> 39:07.734
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.
I DON'T WANT TO FUCKING BE HERE!

39:07.840 --> 39:10.400
THIS IS NOT
FUCKING HAPPENING!

39:10.510 --> 39:13.206
( Paul sobbing )

39:13.310 --> 39:15.847
OKAY, MAYBE IT ISN'T.

39:15.950 --> 39:18.748
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT TOTALLY
FUCKIN' ALONE.

39:18.850 --> 39:20.681
YOU'RE GONNA DIE, DAVID.
JUST LIKE NATE,

39:20.790 --> 39:23.657
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD,
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY.

39:23.760 --> 39:27.082
I AM AWARE OF
THE REALITY OF DEATH.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.954
- I WORK WITH IT EVERY DAY.
- AND YOU'RE SCARED.

39:30.060 --> 39:33.223
YOU'RE MORE SCARED NOW
THAN YOU'VE EVER BEEN
IN YOUR LIFE.

39:33.330 --> 39:36.037
YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW
WHAT FEAR WAS WHEN JAKE
POURED GAS

39:36.140 --> 39:38.404
ALL OVER YOUR HEAD,
BUT THIS--

39:38.510 --> 39:40.705
THIS SIMPLE
UNAVOIDABLE FACT

39:40.810 --> 39:43.301
THAT YOU'RE ALIVE
AND ALONE,

39:43.410 --> 39:45.207
AND THEN SOMEDAY

39:45.310 --> 39:47.073
YOU'LL BE DEAD.
GONE.

39:47.180 --> 39:50.308
- STOP IT.
- YOU'LL NEVER SEE
KEITH AFTER THAT.

39:50.420 --> 39:53.514
- YOU'LL NEVER
SEE YOUR BOYS.
- SHUT UP!

40:03.600 --> 40:05.921
SO WHERE ARE YOU
GONNA GO?

40:07.570 --> 40:09.663
I DON'T KNOW.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.660
JUST AWAY.

40:12.770 --> 40:16.809
I'LL FIND ANOTHER
JOB SOMEWHERE.

40:16.910 --> 40:20.539
- WHY?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE OKAY NOW.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.918
I'M NOT NECESSARY.
I'M NOT.

40:26.820 --> 40:30.449
AND WHEN WERE YOU GONNA
TELL ME THAT YOU WERE LEAVING?

40:32.960 --> 40:35.497
I WOULD HAVE CALLED YOU
WHENEVER I GOT THERE.

40:38.530 --> 40:40.760
WHEREVERI END UP.

40:40.870 --> 40:43.839
BUT YOU-- YOU'VE GOT
FAMILY HERE.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.636
NO, DADDY, I DON'T
HAVE FAMILY HERE.

40:46.740 --> 40:49.675
I HAVE SOME PEOPLE
THAT I'VE RUINED

40:49.780 --> 40:52.442
AND THAT I'VE RUINED
MYSELF IN FRONT OF.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.747
- THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
- WHAT THE HELL'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

40:55.850 --> 40:58.444
DO YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING, DADDY?

40:59.550 --> 41:00.744
I MEAN, DO YOU WAKE
UP EVERY MORNING

41:00.850 --> 41:03.853
TOTALLY BLANK?
JUST EMPTY?

41:03.960 --> 41:06.155
YOU LEFT US!

41:07.460 --> 41:10.725
YOU LEFT ME
AND BRIAN

41:10.830 --> 41:12.866
WITH MOM WHEN SHE
WAS SO FUCKED UP

41:12.970 --> 41:15.564
AND YOU DON'T
EVEN SAY GOODBYE?

41:15.670 --> 41:17.661
- SORRY.
- DON'T BE.

41:17.770 --> 41:19.738
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
THE WAY LIFE IS, RIGHT?

41:19.840 --> 41:21.603
I MEAN, YOU RUIN
THINGS, YOU WALK AWAY.

41:21.710 --> 41:23.678
YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
UNTIL IT'S RUINED--

41:23.780 --> 41:26.578
MAGGIE, IT'S NOT TRUE.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.545
WE ALL TRY
TO DO OUR BEST--

41:28.650 --> 41:30.868
I AM SO SICK
OF PRETENDING
EVERYTHING'S OKAY

41:30.980 --> 41:33.949
JUST SO THAT YOU LIKE ME.
I HATE YOU!

41:34.050 --> 41:36.154
I HATE THAT YOU DRAGGED
ME INTO THIS WORLD

41:36.260 --> 41:38.319
AND YOU LEFT ME HERE!

41:38.420 --> 41:40.650
JUST LET ME GO!

41:58.440 --> 42:00.169
WHY DID WE LEAVE
SCHOOL EARLY?

42:00.280 --> 42:03.078
I RENTED SOME MOVIES
AND GOT THE STUFF
TO MAKE PIZZA.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.819
I WAS MISSING YOU GUYS.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.945
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO KEITH?

42:08.050 --> 42:09.756
NO.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.328
THEN WHY ARE WE
GOING HOME?
FOR REAL.

42:12.430 --> 42:15.251
I JUST WANTED TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH YOU,
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

42:15.360 --> 42:17.123
WHATEVER.

42:17.230 --> 42:19.926
JUST GONNA HAVE TO CALL
SOMEBODY TO GET MY MATH
HOMEWORK FOR ME.

42:20.030 --> 42:22.498
- DO YOU WANT TO GO
BACK TO SCHOOL?
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

42:22.600 --> 42:27.037
BECAUSE I CAN TURN
AROUND AND TAKE YOU BACK
IF YOU'D LIKE IT SO MUCH.

42:27.140 --> 42:30.598
- ANSWER ME, DO YOU WANT
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL?
- Both: NO!

42:32.380 --> 42:35.577
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY
TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.978
I'M SORRY
IF I RUINED YOUR DAY.

42:40.150 --> 42:43.278
DAVID, I JUST FOUND
THE GUY DOWNSTAIRS

42:43.390 --> 42:45.119
TOTALLY NOT READY
FOR THE VIEWING.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.687
I AM HERE ALL ALONE.
IT WOULD BE A REAL TREAT

42:47.790 --> 42:50.827
TO KNOW WHERE
THE FUCK YOU ARE.
CALL ME.

42:53.470 --> 42:55.688
( exhales deeply )

42:56.740 --> 42:59.163
( dialing )

43:02.110 --> 43:03.873
MR. DIAZ?

43:03.980 --> 43:07.199
YES, MRS. DUNCAN,
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

43:07.310 --> 43:09.175
OKAY.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.612
H EY, VAN ESSA.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.881
LISTEN, IF YOU CAN
GET OUT OF WORK EARLY

43:13.990 --> 43:16.208
I COULD REALLY
USE YOUR HELP.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.255
YEAH. YEAH, NOW.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.021
J-- JUST COME

43:22.130 --> 43:24.769
I WILL OWE YOU FOREVER,
I WILL TAKE YOU TO WATER GRILL.

43:24.870 --> 43:27.759
COULD YOU JUST COME?
BYE-BYE.

43:35.980 --> 43:38.198
( sighs )

43:43.950 --> 43:45.747
- I'LL GIVE YOU 800.
- WHAT?

43:45.850 --> 43:49.081
THAT'S LIKE NOTHING.
I MEAN, IT'S A CADILLAC.

43:49.190 --> 43:52.159
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I'M BUYING IT FOR PARTS.

43:53.430 --> 43:54.624
1,500.

43:54.730 --> 43:56.755
- SEVEN.
- YOU JUST SAID EIGHT.

43:56.860 --> 43:59.829
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE
MAKING IT VERY HARD
TO DO YOU A FAVOR.

43:59.930 --> 44:02.296
YOU SHOULD BE THINKING
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

44:02.400 --> 44:04.197
TO BE ALIVE, YOUNG LADY,

44:04.300 --> 44:07.303
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO JACK UP THE PRICE
ON A TOTALED CAR.

44:09.640 --> 44:12.871
- 950.
- DONE.

44:12.980 --> 44:14.777
COME ON, BOYS,
ROLL HER OVER.

44:14.880 --> 44:18.043
- ( truck engine starting )
- GET HER OUT OF HERE.

44:33.230 --> 44:34.891
( chains rattling )

44:35.000 --> 44:37.889
Man:
GET THE CHAINS ON OVER.

44:46.450 --> 44:49.044
Vanessa:
HEY.

44:49.150 --> 44:51.243
CAN I JOIN YOU?

44:51.350 --> 44:54.183
I GUESS.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.768
- YOU WORK HERE?
- NO, MY HUSBAND DOES.
I'M HELPING OUT.

45:09.870 --> 45:12.134
I'M VAN ESSA.

45:12.240 --> 45:13.798
HOLLY.

45:13.910 --> 45:16.208
- HI.
- HI.

45:20.750 --> 45:24.413
WE ARE LIVING IN, LIKE,

45:24.520 --> 45:26.408
THE UNLUCKIEST TIME EVER.

45:29.820 --> 45:31.981
I KNOW IT FEELS
THAT WAY SOMETIMES.

45:32.090 --> 45:34.024
I MEAN, I GREW UP
THINKING I WAS BORN

45:34.130 --> 45:38.191
IN THE TIME WHEN THERE
WAS THE INTERNET, YOU KNOW?

45:38.300 --> 45:41.758
AND THE FALL
OF COMMUNISM.
AND THE GAP.

45:44.940 --> 45:47.738
TURNS OUT MY TIME
IS WHEN THERE'S LIKE

45:47.840 --> 45:50.775
9/11, A BUNCH OF WARS

45:50.880 --> 45:53.144
AND THE END OF EVERYTHING.

45:55.250 --> 45:57.241
WHAT?

45:58.280 --> 46:00.282
DO YOU HAVE KIDS?

46:02.460 --> 46:04.451
NO.

46:05.890 --> 46:08.791
I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT I LOVE MY KIDS.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.549
AND I KNOW
IT'S A HARD TIME,

46:10.660 --> 46:14.096
BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD
IN THIS WORLD.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.259
AND I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS

46:16.370 --> 46:19.498
AND I'M GLAD THAT MY KIDS
GET TO LIVE TO SEE THEM.

46:21.070 --> 46:24.130
- MY BROTHER'S DEAD.
- I KNOW.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.276
I'M SORRY.

46:27.810 --> 46:29.812
- I'M SURE HE WAS A GOOD MAN.
- HE WAS FINE.

46:29.920 --> 46:32.081
THAT'S ALL HE NEEDED TO BE.

46:32.190 --> 46:36.081
THAT'S ALL ANYONE
NEEDS TO BE, IS FINE.

46:36.190 --> 46:39.159
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO GET DESTROYED.

46:40.590 --> 46:42.990
YOU'RE RIGHT.

46:50.900 --> 46:53.061
DID YOU PACK
HER THINGS?

46:53.170 --> 46:55.877
NOT EXACTLY.

46:58.410 --> 47:00.378
I CALLED AN HOUR AGO.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.210
- YOU TOLD HER
I CALLED, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.483
GEORGE TOLD ME-- HE TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE FEELING LIKE

47:06.590 --> 47:09.388
YOU NEEDED TO HAVE HER BACK
AGAIN, BUT I THINK...

47:09.490 --> 47:12.027
SHE'S BEEN SO HAPPY HERE.

47:12.130 --> 47:14.655
OKAY, GEORGE, COULD YOU
PLEASE TAKE MAYA UPSTAIRS

47:14.760 --> 47:16.899
AND PACK HER THINGS?

47:18.300 --> 47:20.222
OR DO I HAVE TO
CALL THE POLICE?

47:20.330 --> 47:21.968
OH, BRENDA!
CALL THE POLICE?

47:22.070 --> 47:24.459
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, UP WE GO.

47:24.570 --> 47:28.233
HEY, WE'LL GO
WASH YOUR DOLL.
COME ON.

47:31.840 --> 47:33.171
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

47:33.280 --> 47:35.168
ALL I AM DOING IS TAKING
MY DAUGHTER HOME.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.339
AFTER YOU LEFT HER HERE
LIKE A BAG OF GARBAGE.

47:37.450 --> 47:39.179
I LEFT HER WITH YOU BECAUSE
IT WAS THE MOST RESPONSIBLE

47:39.290 --> 47:41.645
- THING I COULD
THINK OF DOING.
- RESPONSIBLE?

47:41.750 --> 47:45.129
I NEVER LEFT MY CHILDREN.
I NEVER LEFT THEM FOR A SECOND!
I WOULDN'T! I COULDN'T!

47:45.230 --> 47:47.255
NATE FUCKED MAGGIE
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.055
( gasps )

47:49.160 --> 47:51.799
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- YES, IT IS.
IT IS TRUE, RUTH.

47:51.900 --> 47:53.765
IT'S AS TRUE AS
ANYTHING YOU KNOW.

47:53.870 --> 47:57.362
AND I NEEDED SOME
TIME TO WORK THROUGH
MY ANGER ABOUT THAT

47:57.470 --> 48:00.234
BEFORE I COULD BE
A GOOD MOTHER TO THAT
LITTLE GIRL, WHO I LOVE.

48:00.340 --> 48:03.673
I LOVE AS MUCH
AS MY OWN BABY AND WHO
I AM TAKING HOME.

48:03.780 --> 48:05.998
( gasps )

48:06.880 --> 48:08.643
OH MY GOD.

48:08.750 --> 48:11.014
- OH MY GOSH!
- SIT DOWN.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.782
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- YOUR WATER IS BREAKING.

48:13.890 --> 48:15.949
NO! NO, IT CAN'T.
IT'S TOO EARLY.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.620
JUST SIT DOWN. I'LL GET
YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.529
MAYA CAN STAY HERE
WITH GEORGE.

48:20.630 --> 48:22.450
NO.

48:22.560 --> 48:24.790
( groaning, panting )

48:24.900 --> 48:26.788
OH, SHIT!

48:26.900 --> 48:29.289
( breathing heavily)

48:32.040 --> 48:35.373
( comedic music playing )

48:38.880 --> 48:41.201
THIS MOVIE'S GAY.

48:42.750 --> 48:45.218
WHAT IS GAY,
DU RRELL?

48:46.520 --> 48:48.545
REALLY, WHAT IS GAY?

48:48.650 --> 48:50.550
MOVIES WITH NO TALKING.

48:50.660 --> 48:52.355
Anthony:
IS THE PIZZA READY?

48:52.460 --> 48:54.280
ALMOST, I JUST PUT IT
UNDERNEATH THE BROILER

48:54.390 --> 48:57.518
- TO MELT THE CHEESE
A LITTLE MORE.
- ( knocking )

48:59.030 --> 49:01.863
( pounding on door)

49:01.970 --> 49:05.064
- STAY RIGHT THERE.
- WHO IS IT?

49:05.170 --> 49:06.899
- I DON'T KNOW.
- ( pounding continues )

49:07.010 --> 49:09.433
HELLO?

49:09.540 --> 49:11.531
WHO'S THERE?

49:13.680 --> 49:17.343
NO! DON'T! NO, PLEASE!
PLEASE DON'T KILL HIM!

49:17.450 --> 49:20.385
- THEY'RE GONNA DIE ANYWAY!
- ( smoke alarm beeping )

49:20.490 --> 49:23.186
- SOMETHING'S BURNING!
- SOMETHING'S BURNING!

49:23.290 --> 49:25.656
- WHAT?
- THE PIZZA'S BURNING!

49:25.760 --> 49:28.285
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
- NOTHING'S THE MATTER
WITH ME, DURRELL.

49:28.390 --> 49:31.223
- DON'T TALK
TO ME THAT WAY!
- WHAT DID WE DO?

49:31.330 --> 49:33.366
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU!

49:33.470 --> 49:35.768
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN HERE!

49:35.870 --> 49:38.589
ANTHONY, COME WITH ME.
JESUS CHRIST.

49:39.970 --> 49:42.734
( beeping stops )

49:42.840 --> 49:47.106
SO, YOUR MOM
CAME RIGHT OVER.

49:47.210 --> 49:49.269
SHE HELPED EVERYONE
GET SEATED.

49:49.380 --> 49:51.143
SHE EVEN TALKED
TO PEOPLE AFTERWARDS.

49:51.250 --> 49:53.286
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

49:53.390 --> 49:55.551
WAS IT SAD?

49:55.660 --> 49:57.787
YEAH, IT WAS.

49:57.890 --> 49:59.585
BUT IT FELT GOOD.

49:59.690 --> 50:02.488
YOU KNOW, TO BE THERE
FOR PEOPLE. IT DID.

50:05.530 --> 50:07.464
I CALLED THE REALTOR.

50:07.570 --> 50:10.698
I'M GONNA GO SEE THAT
PLACE TOMORROW AT NOON

50:10.800 --> 50:13.234
IF YOU WANT TO COME.

50:20.250 --> 50:23.139
( door opening )

50:23.250 --> 50:25.411
( door closing )

50:27.620 --> 50:29.781
ARE THEY ASLEEP?

50:29.890 --> 50:32.358
ALMOST.

50:43.070 --> 50:45.265
DAVID, YOU GOT TO--

50:47.040 --> 50:49.634
I DON'T KNOW.

50:49.740 --> 50:51.674
I KNOW.

50:51.780 --> 50:54.908
IT ISN'T GOOD FOR THE BOYS
TO BE AROUND YOU LIKE THIS.

50:55.010 --> 50:58.241
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

51:02.220 --> 51:04.256
I FEEL LIKE...

51:04.360 --> 51:06.828
WHAT?

51:09.260 --> 51:12.195
KEITH, I FEEL LIKE
MY FACE IS COMING OFF.

51:15.370 --> 51:17.395
I KEEP TRYING
TO HOLD IT ON,

51:17.500 --> 51:19.809
BUT I CAN'T.
IT KEEPS COMING OFF.

51:21.340 --> 51:23.604
WHAT'S UNDERN EATH
IS JUST...

51:29.050 --> 51:30.745
I DON'T WANT
THE BOYS TO GO AWAY.

51:30.850 --> 51:34.547
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF SENDING THE BOYS ANYWHERE.

51:35.590 --> 51:37.410
GOOD.

51:37.520 --> 51:40.683
BUT I DO THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD GO AWAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

51:42.660 --> 51:44.753
TILL YOU...

51:44.860 --> 51:48.318
UNTIL YOU GET BETTER.

51:48.430 --> 51:51.433
THE BOYS ARE SCARED TO BE
AROUND YOU RIGHT NOW, DAVID.

51:51.540 --> 51:55.237
THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU.

51:56.040 --> 51:58.338
( sighs )

52:00.180 --> 52:03.240
IT'S NOT GOOD.

52:04.650 --> 52:07.289
( breathes deeply)

52:09.790 --> 52:12.258
( "Cold Wind" playing )

52:28.240 --> 52:30.606
( Brenda panting,
screaming )

52:34.710 --> 52:36.610
FUCK.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.210
( grunting )

52:38.320 --> 52:41.847
( wailing )

52:44.460 --> 52:47.952
IS MY BABY OKAY?
TELL ME, IS MY BABY
GONNA BE OKAY?

52:48.060 --> 52:49.925
JUST KEEP PUSHING.
JUST KEEP PUSHING.

52:52.830 --> 52:55.264
( Brenda groans )

52:58.200 --> 53:00.259
FUCK!

53:00.370 --> 53:03.407
( screaming )

53:14.850 --> 53:17.182
( music continues )
