the soaps by Christmas.

04:58.606 --> 05:02.330
I should do all your
applications, well done.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.585
- No, it's not that at
all, this is something--

05:04.585 --> 05:06.840
- These punk filmmakers,

05:06.840 --> 05:09.213
they don't know what they're doing.

05:09.213 --> 05:10.522
They've got no respect.

05:10.522 --> 05:14.077
They don't know how hard I
worked the people I looked after.

05:14.077 --> 05:15.577
My responsibility.

05:16.810 --> 05:21.245
My daughter is not going to
get the role I put her up for.

05:21.245 --> 05:23.182
- Dad, what the hell
are you talking about?

05:23.182 --> 05:25.690
In fact, who the hell are you talking to?

05:25.690 --> 05:29.690
You didn't apply for this
role for me, I did it.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.879
- No, you didn't.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.284
I see what goes in and out

05:38.751 --> 05:41.966
of every computer and device in our house.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.006
Don't lie to me, I got you this role.

05:45.006 --> 05:48.159
I did the application for you, princess.

05:48.159 --> 05:52.942
- Dad, I'm not princess and
you didn't get me this role.

05:52.942 --> 05:54.845
I shot the audition
tape at Veronica's house

05:54.845 --> 05:56.253
so I applied separately.

05:56.253 --> 05:57.486
- Show me.

05:57.486 --> 06:00.750
- I can't do it on my
phone, I need the computer.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.190
- Well the laptop's in the boot.

06:02.190 --> 06:05.135
I'll play it later and
you'll see that we applied.

06:05.135 --> 06:09.727
- Oh don't tell me you
sent in two applications.

06:09.727 --> 06:13.213
Oh God, you're just embarrassing.

06:13.213 --> 06:15.389
Heaven forbid I actually
get somewhere with this

06:15.389 --> 06:18.973
and have to deal with people,
what is wrong with you?

06:18.973 --> 06:21.934
Dad, I hate to say this
but you're making this

06:21.934 --> 06:24.267
really difficult for me now.

06:25.501 --> 06:28.741
- Should've worn a low cut
top, shown some more flesh,

06:28.741 --> 06:31.651
worn better lipstick, you've a studio,

06:31.651 --> 06:33.746
you could've done the
tape properly, princess.

06:33.746 --> 06:36.746
- Jesus Dad, what is wrong with you?

06:38.533 --> 06:40.197
It's something.

06:40.197 --> 06:42.949
Let me have a moment of
something I achieved myself.

06:42.949 --> 06:44.421
Let me do this.

06:44.421 --> 06:47.156
I'm 19, I could be at
university but I delayed

06:47.156 --> 06:48.641
because you decided to come back.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.565
- [Dad] I didn't say you couldn't go!

06:50.565 --> 06:52.566
- Dad, you just said I should've worn

06:52.566 --> 06:55.028
a low cut top and shown some flesh.

06:55.028 --> 06:57.528
- Must've been thinking aloud.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.573
- What studio are you talking about?

07:01.573 --> 07:03.557
- [Dad] I got us a studio.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.948
- You got a what?

07:04.948 --> 07:06.803
- I found this place to rent.

07:06.803 --> 07:08.886
I watched a YouTube channel,
followed a filmmaking guide,

07:08.886 --> 07:10.597
got all the equipment
to do the tape properly

07:10.597 --> 07:12.900
and we can be filmmakers.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.188
Now we'll get you the real work.

07:15.188 --> 07:17.684
- That's great, Dad, but you're my Dad.

07:17.684 --> 07:19.382
When did you become a filmmaker?

07:19.382 --> 07:23.075
- Yeah, I'm your Dad and
you're not in university

07:23.075 --> 07:24.468
because you didn't work hard enough.

07:24.468 --> 07:27.284
Me and your mother, we tried so hard--

07:27.284 --> 07:30.326
- Dad, you were in Japan
for like five years.

07:30.326 --> 07:34.230
You'd come back Christmas,
summer if we were lucky.

07:34.230 --> 07:36.325
Now you're back and you're so different.

07:36.325 --> 07:39.461
- I'm not different, Connie.

07:39.461 --> 07:42.211
I just got depressed, that's all.

07:43.702 --> 07:46.582
- Mom said you met a new wife out there.

07:46.582 --> 07:48.193
A Filipino woman.

07:48.193 --> 07:51.045
But she died so you decided to come back.

07:51.045 --> 07:53.716
I actually fucking wish
you'd never come back.

07:53.716 --> 07:57.799
Look at me like I'm that
girl on American Beauty.

07:59.907 --> 08:02.223
- You're my daughter.

08:02.223 --> 08:04.433
You look stunning.

08:04.433 --> 08:06.254
I'm here to help.

08:06.254 --> 08:07.421
- Help, right.

08:09.214 --> 08:10.991
- Your mother lies to you, Connie.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.347
- Does she, really?

08:13.347 --> 08:15.151
- Yeah, your mother lies to you.

08:15.151 --> 08:18.735
That woman lies through her teeth.

08:18.735 --> 08:20.799
I'm gonna have to do something about her.

08:20.799 --> 08:22.861
- You're saying this to me?

08:22.861 --> 08:24.111
Mama drinks like a fish

08:24.111 --> 08:26.763
but you're acting like you wanna kill her.

08:26.763 --> 08:28.143
- She's done nothing.

08:28.143 --> 08:31.233
- Dad, you just said that
woman lies through her teeth

08:31.233 --> 08:34.458
and you're gonna have to
do something about her.

08:34.458 --> 08:36.876
- [Dad] Thinking aloud again.

08:37.871 --> 08:39.645
- You've gotten so weird

08:39.645 --> 08:41.246
ever since I started doing this.

08:41.246 --> 08:42.573
- [Dad] I want you to do this.

08:42.573 --> 08:45.133
- Let me do it, let me see where it goes.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.093
- Of course.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.831
I'm just having issues with your mother.

08:48.831 --> 08:50.331
Go on, go to work.

08:51.521 --> 08:53.901
- Do you remember where I work?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.461
- I got you the job, didn't I?

08:56.461 --> 08:58.509
- Are you picking me up or is Mom?

08:58.509 --> 09:00.269
- I'll pick you up, princess.

09:00.269 --> 09:04.019
- Stop being weird, stop
calling me princess.

09:06.317 --> 09:08.702
- Connie, I'm sorry.

09:08.702 --> 09:10.861
Princess was the name we'd given the baby.

09:10.861 --> 09:12.528
- Dad, I don't care.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.759
I'm not being callous

09:15.759 --> 09:17.982
but all that happened 50,000 miles away.

09:17.982 --> 09:19.437
I was never a part of it.

09:19.437 --> 09:21.180
I don't want to hear about it

09:21.180 --> 09:24.263
so don't tell me about it ever again.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.232
- [Operator] You have a new message.

09:38.232 --> 09:39.439
New messages.

09:39.439 --> 09:43.059
- [Emile] Hi Connie, this is Emile Francis

09:43.059 --> 09:44.482
from The Frost Glistens.

09:44.482 --> 09:46.655
Would you take a minute to be
able to get in touch with us?

09:46.655 --> 09:49.032
We have a few things we'd
like to sort out with you.

09:49.032 --> 09:51.125
If you could get back to us,
you could give me an email

09:51.125 --> 09:53.832
or alternatively you can give me a call

09:53.832 --> 09:55.082
at 0787-233181,

09:57.762 --> 09:59.112
that would be wonderful.

09:59.112 --> 10:00.534
Thank you very much, Connie,

10:00.534 --> 10:03.362
I hope you have a wonderful day.

10:03.362 --> 10:05.695
- [Operator] To return call.

talking about technology

10:17.327 --> 10:20.015

11:57.004 --> 11:58.220
- Why not?

11:58.220 --> 12:00.409
- You're just so fucking arrogant.

12:00.409 --> 12:02.124
You treat us like shit.

12:02.124 --> 12:04.117
You live in that fucking palace

12:04.117 --> 12:06.037
that none of us are ever
allowed to come into.

12:06.037 --> 12:07.547

as we're struggling to
get by with our shit lives

12:10.135 --> 12:13.560

university courses but you--

12:13.560 --> 12:15.803

12:15.803 --> 12:16.636
- Why not?

12:17.723 --> 12:18.827
You don't even give us the time of day.

12:18.827 --> 12:21.111
It's just me, fucking me, look at me,

12:21.111 --> 12:22.779
I'm so fucking perfect.

12:22.779 --> 12:25.356
Watch me do something insipid on YouTube.

12:25.356 --> 12:27.259

12:27.259 --> 12:29.529
I'm not stupid, Danny.

12:29.529 --> 12:30.362

12:31.675 --> 12:35.067
You're privileged, you're indulged.

12:35.067 --> 12:36.984
Sometimes you don't even say hi to me.

12:36.984 --> 12:39.884
- I don't mean--
- That's what you're like.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.073
You're not very sincere.

12:42.073 --> 12:44.889
Come on, you can respond to that.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.288
- I can't.
- Why not?

12:47.288 --> 12:49.288
- I just can't, alright?

12:50.649 --> 12:51.899
- At least go back to school.

12:51.899 --> 12:53.399
- I've got a job.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.574
I'm smart, I don't need
to go back to school.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.240
- You think you're clever
because someone told you you are.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.072
I'm a grade A fucking student,

13:00.072 --> 13:02.361
I would never dream of
recording myself ever.

13:02.361 --> 13:05.484
Yeah, you're a little bit
smarter than the others

13:05.484 --> 13:06.983
but you're not clever.

13:06.983 --> 13:07.961
- Stop bullying me.

13:07.961 --> 13:11.044
- No, I'm trying to be real with you.

13:12.905 --> 13:16.748
You were cool before but this acting,

13:16.748 --> 13:18.971
it's going to your head.

13:18.971 --> 13:20.763
You never did it before and now you think

13:20.763 --> 13:21.784
you're better than all of us.

13:21.784 --> 13:23.686
- I don't.
- You do!

13:23.686 --> 13:24.650
You're like that with everyone,

13:24.650 --> 13:27.067
you've turned into this brat.

13:49.367 --> 13:51.536
- [Cameraman] You ready to go, Connie?

13:51.536 --> 13:53.165
- Yeah.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.591
(coughing)

13:54.591 --> 13:55.424
- [Cameraman] Three, two, one.

13:55.424 --> 13:56.257
(beeping)

13:56.257 --> 13:59.924
- Hey October 2007, hey
Internet, hey world,

14:00.821 --> 14:03.861
hey those creepy guys
who know who I mistakenly

14:03.861 --> 14:05.988
had some kind of Internet thing with.

14:05.988 --> 14:09.110
Hey my few thousand-ish growing fans,

14:09.110 --> 14:11.800
I'm Connie Castillo and
welcome to another episode

14:11.800 --> 14:16.800
of my show slash talk slash
rant, Princess in the Castle.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.455
Are you my prince?

14:18.455 --> 14:19.975
I'm kind of looking for one

14:19.975 --> 14:23.111
but I don't really admit that
to anyone except the Internet

14:23.111 --> 14:25.175
which kind of tells you
where I'm at with life.

14:25.175 --> 14:27.490
So on today's show we're talking

14:27.490 --> 14:29.189
about weirdo fucking parents.

14:29.189 --> 14:32.536
We've all got them but I seem
to have Dr. Weird-en-stein

14:32.536 --> 14:35.032
from Weird-ganistan as
the thing responsible

14:35.032 --> 14:36.661
for my creation on this planet.

14:36.661 --> 14:39.395
So send me your comments please.

14:39.395 --> 14:41.252
We are live and I'll see
them when they buzz through.

14:41.252 --> 14:44.502
Oh, I see ya and I agree with ya C-Dos.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.476
So, basically I kind of
want to be an actress

14:49.476 --> 14:51.011
but I do have mega self doubt.

14:51.011 --> 14:52.777
See, the thing is I can actually be

14:52.777 --> 14:54.719
so fucking dumb, it's unreal.

14:54.719 --> 14:58.239
Like I surprise myself sometimes
with what I just don't get.

14:58.239 --> 15:01.556
And I've said this before on
here but my grades are terrible

15:01.556 --> 15:03.574
which means I have no qualifications

15:03.574 --> 15:06.083
which means I still work
in a shopping centre

15:06.083 --> 15:07.555
instead of going to university

15:07.555 --> 15:10.388
all because I'm a lazy
fucking bitch, right?

15:10.388 --> 15:12.052
Who's not gonna agree with that?

15:12.052 --> 15:15.379
See, on here I can be so honest

15:15.379 --> 15:17.206
'cause you're only gonna judge me

15:17.206 --> 15:19.540
by ripping me to pieces
in those comments section

15:19.540 --> 15:24.273
which, like, wow, where does
some of that shit come from?

15:24.273 --> 15:27.843
Anyway, I'm gonna be here
for a while but I need to pee

15:27.843 --> 15:30.843
so stay online and feedback with me.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.399
- [Cameraman] And that's good.

15:37.816 --> 15:40.022
- I got a really big part today.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.505
That's what I've been wanting to tell you.

15:42.505 --> 15:43.960
I thought you'd listen.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.072
I thought you'd want to know
rather than just abusing me.

15:46.072 --> 15:49.383
- I'm not abusing you, Connie.

15:49.383 --> 15:53.112
All you want is fame and
people looking at you,

15:53.112 --> 15:54.371
telling you how stunning you are,

15:54.371 --> 15:56.501
you are stunning, Connie.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.834
I applied for the same film.

15:59.704 --> 16:02.121
- Don't you know the outcome?

16:04.825 --> 16:06.959
- The cast has got announced.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.876
- And you're in it too?

16:08.876 --> 16:10.459
- I can't make the dates.

16:10.459 --> 16:13.307
I can't make the dates, I've got work.

16:13.307 --> 16:17.438
Connie, I was speaking to
the guy every step of the way

16:17.438 --> 16:19.422
but there was nothing he could do

16:19.422 --> 16:22.089
so he's going with someone else.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.452
He said he'd keep me in
mind for future projects

16:25.452 --> 16:27.369
and he asked after you.

16:29.273 --> 16:31.000
- And what did you say to that?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.500
- I said you were pretty good.

16:34.679 --> 16:37.465
Didn't say how insipid you've become.

16:37.465 --> 16:40.215
- Did you see the casting notice?

16:42.312 --> 16:46.812
- Bebe Marie, Lucy in the
feature, the Frost Glistens.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.016
- Is that not cool?

16:51.016 --> 16:52.479
- Bebe Marie,

16:52.479 --> 16:57.479
you know your YouTube has
just gone next level, right?

16:57.599 --> 17:00.462
Would have been cool if I was in it.

17:00.462 --> 17:02.847
- Am I really so self centred?

17:02.847 --> 17:06.430
- Yes, you are, to me
and to everyone else.

17:08.347 --> 17:10.097
You've become a dick.

17:11.868 --> 17:13.198
- You don't wanna speak to me anymore?

17:13.198 --> 17:15.758
- I'm not your boyfriend.

17:15.758 --> 17:17.712
You told me that on enough occasions.

17:17.712 --> 17:20.555
There's only so many rejections I can take

17:20.555 --> 17:23.472
before I can't be bothered anymore.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.480
You don't flirt with someone
for five fucking months

17:26.480 --> 17:28.528
without expecting some sort of a reaction.

17:28.528 --> 17:29.646
- Great.

17:29.646 --> 17:31.856
- I'm not really sorry.

17:31.856 --> 17:33.523
I'm stopping it now.

17:35.167 --> 17:37.948
I'm drawing the line, I've got to.

17:37.948 --> 17:38.781
- Wow.

17:40.334 --> 17:42.299
- It could have been so different.

17:42.299 --> 17:45.049
- Guess I'll see you around then.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.322
- No actually, you won't.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.540
Me and Mom are moving.

17:52.540 --> 17:57.540
You were cool for a bit but
the boys will fancy your Mom.

17:57.788 --> 17:59.935
And we're all just
creeped out by your Dad.

17:59.935 --> 18:03.852
What he did, what he said
to me, that was just.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.693
Even my stepdad sided
with me on that situation.

18:07.693 --> 18:11.860
He had a drink too, I
wanted to smash his face in.

18:13.212 --> 18:15.598
- Yeah, he's getting really pushy.

18:15.598 --> 18:19.867
- I'm surprised he hasn't
fucked you yet to be honest.

18:19.867 --> 18:22.060
- Oh fuck off, what?

18:22.060 --> 18:24.076
- Yeah, it's that weird, Connie.

18:24.076 --> 18:26.243
That's what it looks like.

18:27.736 --> 18:29.498
I guess I kind of loved you for a bit but

18:29.498 --> 18:31.610
that was so long ago

18:31.610 --> 18:35.027
I'm almost embarrassed to think about it.

18:39.339 --> 18:42.006
Yeah, just look at me like that.

18:43.467 --> 18:46.586
I've seen them so many times before.

18:46.586 --> 18:48.570
It's called the I'm so
wrapped up with guilt

18:48.570 --> 18:52.169
that I can't face up to what I think look.

18:52.169 --> 18:53.669
It's such a shame.

18:55.452 --> 18:59.566
You broke my heart,
Connie, you broke my heart.

18:59.566 --> 19:01.066
- Is that it then?

19:06.206 --> 19:08.011
- What do you think I've done?

19:08.011 --> 19:08.988
- I don't know, David,

19:08.988 --> 19:11.179
I never knew what you've been
up to thousands of miles away.

19:11.179 --> 19:13.212
- I married a woman I fell in love with.

19:13.212 --> 19:15.597
She died giving birth to my daughter

19:15.597 --> 19:17.401
who was called Princess.

19:17.401 --> 19:21.047
Princess died a few
weeks after from malaria.

19:21.047 --> 19:23.865
I was never coming back home, Bonnie.

19:23.865 --> 19:27.161
- Do you know your Dad
comes on your YouTube show?

19:27.161 --> 19:28.662
- What are you talking about?

19:28.662 --> 19:30.649
- I don't know, Connie, it's weird.

19:30.649 --> 19:34.041
I think everyone thinks he's part of it,

19:34.041 --> 19:37.113
that's why you get all those comments.

19:37.113 --> 19:38.893
- It's the Internet.

19:38.893 --> 19:41.577
What part does he come in on?

19:41.577 --> 19:43.484
- And what Dr. Ron said,

19:43.484 --> 19:44.921
you're only this far away

19:44.921 --> 19:46.665
from needing anti-psychotic medication.

19:46.665 --> 19:48.809
You're ill.
- I'm not ill!

19:48.809 --> 19:50.168
- Okay so you're wrong.

19:50.168 --> 19:54.698
You are sick in your mind, in
your body and in your soul.

19:54.698 --> 19:56.267
- I'm looking out for Connie.

19:56.267 --> 19:57.417
- You aren't looking out for Connie,

19:57.417 --> 19:58.635
you've got her on a leash.

19:58.635 --> 20:00.873
She can't do anything without
checking in with you first

20:00.873 --> 20:04.313
and believe me she's going
to be broken because of it.

20:04.313 --> 20:06.477
- What part does he come in on?

20:06.477 --> 20:09.613
- I don't know, just Clarissa
told me, I haven't seen it.

20:09.613 --> 20:12.446
I think its when you go for a pee,

20:14.076 --> 20:16.077
he makes a thing of that.

20:16.077 --> 20:17.707
- Stream plays out live,

20:17.707 --> 20:20.220
I've got enough
subscribers, I can do that.

20:20.220 --> 20:24.141
I don't care what I say 'cause
no one's recording it, right?

20:24.141 --> 20:26.224
- Well, someone might be.

20:31.262 --> 20:33.131
- What are you talking
about my Dad coming in, how?

20:33.131 --> 20:36.766
- Well apparently first
there was like this figure

20:36.766 --> 20:40.141
that came across the screen
and then he bumped his head

20:40.141 --> 20:41.420
through the dog's house.

20:41.420 --> 20:46.420
Well then he did the episode
when you get yourself drunk.

20:46.942 --> 20:48.299
- Yeah.

20:48.299 --> 20:51.228
- See, I don't think you
got yourself that drunk.

20:51.228 --> 20:54.669
When you go through the comments

20:54.669 --> 20:59.169
it says that some guy came
and put pills in your coke.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.073
- There's something wrong with my Dad

21:02.073 --> 21:03.467
but he's not like that.

21:03.467 --> 21:05.447
That's just people getting on my back

21:05.447 --> 21:07.614
'cause the show's getting
like by a lot of people.

21:07.614 --> 21:11.197
- Connie, I don't think
we should be seeing

21:13.404 --> 21:15.486
much of each other anymore.

21:15.486 --> 21:16.319
- Why not?

21:19.894 --> 21:23.225
- 'Cause you don't realise what you've got

21:23.225 --> 21:26.233
and now you treat the rest
of us like we're substandard.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.900
And yeah, your Dad got so weird,

21:29.769 --> 21:32.680
like I would be scared
to get in a car with him

21:32.680 --> 21:34.024
because he could just kill me

21:34.024 --> 21:35.816
and bury me in a field or something,

21:35.816 --> 21:37.864
that's how weird he's
got but you just kept

21:37.864 --> 21:40.313
bringing up to him so you to stop it.

21:40.313 --> 21:42.519
I don't know what you're trying to achieve

21:42.519 --> 21:44.055
or if you just don't
realise what's going on

21:44.055 --> 21:45.544
but it's wrong.

21:45.544 --> 21:49.030
You're older than me but
the way you're with him

21:49.030 --> 21:52.774
it's like when I was with
my Dad when I was 12.

21:52.774 --> 21:54.904
When I was a kid.

21:54.904 --> 21:57.000
I'm not a kid anymore.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.500
It's just control.

21:59.447 --> 22:03.530
You play up to it and it
makes you look immature.

22:05.977 --> 22:07.430
And you're not immature, Connie,

22:07.430 --> 22:08.728
but if someone like me is telling you that

22:08.728 --> 22:11.545
then something is not right.

22:11.545 --> 22:15.962
Look, I'm sorry, I know
you've got your ups and downs

22:18.073 --> 22:21.823
in your mood but I just
can't cope with this.

22:25.881 --> 22:26.714
- Alright.

22:28.459 --> 22:32.959
- I don't think you're someone
I want to know anymore.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.062
- Alright, bye.

22:42.645 --> 22:44.279
- Connie needs me.

22:44.279 --> 22:47.458
- Connie doesn't need you
David, you're obsessed with her.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.702
You haven't seen her in
five years, you come back,

22:49.702 --> 22:51.349
she's grown tits and and
ass and a face to die for

22:51.349 --> 22:53.540
and suddenly you don't
see your daughter anymore,

22:53.540 --> 22:55.863
you see some girl on
the street you can save

22:55.863 --> 22:59.427
with businessman with
a trust fund routine.

22:59.427 --> 23:01.172
It may work in China or Thailand

23:01.172 --> 23:06.084
or wherever it is you've been
but it does not work here.

23:06.084 --> 23:07.447
Okay, let me tell you
something about Connie

23:07.447 --> 23:10.263
before I ask you to get
out of our lives again.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.480
I don't think much of Connie.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.302
I am her mother, she is
my daughter, I love her,

23:15.302 --> 23:16.965
if anything happened to
her I would be heartbroken

23:16.965 --> 23:19.111
but for who she is and the way
she lives her life right now

23:19.111 --> 23:21.463
I loathe her, I loathe my own daughter

23:21.463 --> 23:23.285
and I will tell you why, it is because you

23:23.285 --> 23:26.285
have helped me make a fucking idiot.

23:27.509 --> 23:28.678
I don't know what it is I did,

23:28.678 --> 23:31.413
maybe it was undiagnosed foetal
alcohol syndrome or something

23:31.413 --> 23:34.566
but whatever it is that
girl is just a shadow.

23:34.566 --> 23:36.932
She's gotta get her head out of her phone

23:36.932 --> 23:38.312
and stop living in this land of fairytales

23:38.312 --> 23:40.838
and whatever these jobs that
you're putting her up for.

23:40.838 --> 23:44.405
She's not capable nor is she ready

23:44.405 --> 23:47.272
and I should know because
I was at that age.

23:47.272 --> 23:49.157
Do you remember, Bonnie the actor?

23:49.157 --> 23:52.240
Award nominated, won, nominated, won,

23:54.120 --> 23:57.623
I mean best fucking film,
best fucking actress,

23:57.623 --> 24:00.840
best fucking song, best fucking
fuck, I did it all, David.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.848
And you were just a
stain on the invitation.

24:03.848 --> 24:05.781
(laughing)

24:05.781 --> 24:07.334
You gave it all up to give birth

24:07.334 --> 24:10.056
brat-icus achieve-icus nothing-us.

24:10.056 --> 24:13.831
That kind of failure does
not sit well with me.

24:13.831 --> 24:16.021
Can you imagine if I showed
up for those kind of jobs

24:16.021 --> 24:17.463
that you put Connie up for?

24:17.463 --> 24:19.302
Those directors would shit themselves

24:19.302 --> 24:20.454
if I walked in the door.

24:20.454 --> 24:22.452
Award nominated actress
showing up for a sandwich

24:22.452 --> 24:25.608
and a train fare because
they like the script

24:25.608 --> 24:27.528
'cause they wanna mock their daughter.

24:27.528 --> 24:31.346
- The divorce is a formality now, is it?

24:31.346 --> 24:35.235
- I'm talking about your fucking princess.

24:35.235 --> 24:37.832
Well after thousands of
applications, she finally got a job.

24:37.832 --> 24:40.358
Let me guess, it's the playing
card in the school pantomime?

24:40.358 --> 24:42.822
Oh no, hang on, she got
kicked out of school.

24:42.822 --> 24:45.448
So she must third spear
holder from the left?

24:45.448 --> 24:47.671
- No, it's a good script.

24:47.671 --> 24:49.685
It's called As The Frost Glistens.

24:49.685 --> 24:54.613
They gave her the lead and
she applied for herself.

24:54.613 --> 24:56.166
- Oh, she did tell me about that,

24:56.166 --> 24:58.167
she did it at Veronica's house.

24:58.167 --> 24:59.669
- And you couldn't tell me?

24:59.669 --> 25:01.525
- Why would I tell you?

25:01.525 --> 25:06.525
I want Connie to grow up
and get out, I resent her.

25:06.608 --> 25:07.808
God.

25:07.808 --> 25:10.735
I mean, I gave up my career for her

25:10.735 --> 25:12.194
and she doesn't even have the smarts

25:12.194 --> 25:15.714
to finish her high school exams
let alone become an actress.

25:15.714 --> 25:19.047
I mean yes, she's famous
on YouTube but, fuck.

25:20.113 --> 25:22.801
- I hate conflict.
- Oh, I love conflict.

25:22.801 --> 25:24.751
- I used to have responsibility.

25:24.751 --> 25:26.304
- Yeah and you don't have
any responsibility anymore

25:26.304 --> 25:28.463
and you will never have
any responsibility again

25:28.463 --> 25:31.840
unless you could see your
way to being responsible

25:31.840 --> 25:36.091
for killing Connie and me, just a thought,

25:36.091 --> 25:40.008
I could goad you a little
bit more if it helps.

I'd say that's why
there's a media blackout.

27:58.373 --> 28:00.540
I didn't feel it with her.

28:04.936 --> 28:08.276
Well if it was her, I'm pretty
sure my first words to her

28:08.276 --> 28:10.276
would've been I'm sorry.

28:17.460 --> 28:20.210
(dramatic music)

28:55.624 --> 28:57.457
- You're 34 this year.

28:58.312 --> 28:59.395
- No, I'm 36.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.519
- Oh Jesus Christ, I'm in
purgatory, do you know that?

29:02.519 --> 29:05.208
I've lived my life in this house with you

29:05.208 --> 29:06.918
and you're talentless.

29:06.918 --> 29:08.808
- Dad loved me, Mother.

29:08.808 --> 29:13.382
- He loves you in all the
wrong ways, don't you get it?

29:13.382 --> 29:17.303
The abuse is endemic, why
don't you understand that?

29:17.303 --> 29:20.456
- You don't understand what's wrong.

29:20.456 --> 29:22.385
- I'm not your mother.

29:22.385 --> 29:26.052
I'm not, that's why I
can be so mean to you.

29:28.995 --> 29:33.606
I'm your rival for his affections
and you're his favourite.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.439
- I know, I like that.

29:36.503 --> 29:38.086
- Not so dumb then.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.094
- I don't know, I don't think too much.

29:41.094 --> 29:42.677
I go out most days.

29:44.021 --> 29:45.688
- Oh yeah, your job.

29:46.645 --> 29:49.312
- I'm not so good at it anymore.

29:50.711 --> 29:51.654
- Why not?

29:51.654 --> 29:54.821
- [Connie] I'm not good with the money

29:57.815 --> 29:59.769
and I'm not good at watching people.

29:59.769 --> 30:02.467
- That's because you need new glasses

30:02.467 --> 30:05.273
and you didn't finish school.

30:05.273 --> 30:06.617
- I don't know.

30:06.617 --> 30:07.926
All I know is I'm happy most days.

30:07.926 --> 30:11.784
Dad says you're the mad
lady we have to live with.

30:11.784 --> 30:14.201
You've got nowhere else to go

30:15.270 --> 30:17.672
and you don't like going outside
so we keep you in the wall.

30:17.672 --> 30:21.124
- Do you think you could kill
someone if I showed you how?

30:21.124 --> 30:22.775
- [Connie] You want me to kill you?

30:22.775 --> 30:25.692
- Mm, if it's not too inconvenient.

30:27.063 --> 30:30.950
- I've got underdeveloped motor skills

30:30.950 --> 30:33.173
according to Dr. Mann.

30:33.173 --> 30:36.373
We did corset work and
the Mom picked up on it.

30:36.373 --> 30:40.147
I don't like you very much, you know that.

30:40.147 --> 30:44.804
- Weren't you in a film
when you were younger?

30:44.804 --> 30:46.483
- [Connie] I was in a movie.

30:46.483 --> 30:48.245
Dad said I couldn't be in them anymore

30:48.245 --> 30:52.134
because I 'cause I'd
stop being a princess.

30:52.134 --> 30:55.381
- Was this before or
after you hit your head?

30:55.381 --> 30:59.881
- [Connie] I didn't hit my
head, my head got vibrated.

31:16.339 --> 31:19.339
(suspenseful music)

31:52.701 --> 31:55.451
(engine revving)

32:07.162 --> 32:09.412
(mumbling)

32:13.356 --> 32:17.323
Hi guys, it's Connie here,
just checking in with you guys.

32:17.323 --> 32:19.005
How's everything been this week?

32:19.005 --> 32:22.299
Today I'm gonna talk to you
a little bit about makeup

32:22.299 --> 32:24.049
and fashion and hair.

32:25.482 --> 32:30.138
So as you can see I'm really
feeling the messy waves

32:30.138 --> 32:32.812
at the moment which is
actually very simple to do.

32:32.812 --> 32:36.797
I just put it up in a bun
in the night, slept on it

32:36.797 --> 32:38.700
and it came out like this.

32:38.700 --> 32:43.117
(speaker drowned out by opera music)

32:56.439 --> 33:00.047
So I'm gonna recommend that to you guys.

33:00.047 --> 33:01.750
Look how pretty this is.

33:01.750 --> 33:04.417
Look how pretty the lipstick is.

33:10.764 --> 33:13.048
- You've got no idea, have you?

33:13.048 --> 33:14.215
- [Connie] No.

33:15.098 --> 33:16.848
- He lobotomized you.

33:18.508 --> 33:19.489
- Is that cool?

33:19.489 --> 33:21.592
- Oh no, it is not cool at all.

33:21.592 --> 33:25.675
- [Connie] I can still do
everything he tells me.

33:27.194 --> 33:29.914
- But is that good for you?

33:29.914 --> 33:31.331
- [Connie] Maybe.

33:32.489 --> 33:35.749
- How long do you reckon
I've been in here?

33:35.749 --> 33:39.485
- [Connie] Mm, longer than
me but you're my mother so.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.308
- I'm not your mother.

33:41.308 --> 33:42.691
- [Connie] Pretty sure you are.

33:42.691 --> 33:45.033
- Pretty sure isn't yes.

33:45.033 --> 33:46.816
- [Connie] Daddy would
say you're having another

33:46.816 --> 33:50.042
of your episodes, Bonnie,
time for the medication.

33:50.042 --> 33:54.709
- Oh, cute nose, one thing,
do you know what sort it is?

33:56.135 --> 34:00.225
- [Connie] No, I have been
talking on the phone to Dr. Mann,

34:00.225 --> 34:02.808
it's a psy-cot-ic or something.

34:05.449 --> 34:06.949
- Anti-psychotics.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.358
Oh Jesus, that explains everything.

34:15.399 --> 34:17.565
Does he have sex with you?

34:19.708 --> 34:22.898
- [Connie] I know other people
have sex, but I don't, Mom.

34:22.898 --> 34:25.708
I don't know what to do.

34:25.708 --> 34:27.291
- But he drugs you?

34:28.538 --> 34:30.266
- [Connie] Does he?

34:30.266 --> 34:34.275
See, I'm not so stupid that I don't see

34:34.275 --> 34:36.341
that you understand what's going on here

34:36.341 --> 34:38.174
in a way that I don't.

34:39.572 --> 34:43.947
- You get drugged and fucked
by your Dad on a regular basis.

34:43.947 --> 34:45.877
I'm on anti-psychotics so I don't know

34:45.877 --> 34:48.661
what the fuck's going on but I am starting

34:48.661 --> 34:51.719
to come clear enough
now or waking up enough

34:51.719 --> 34:53.460
to be compos mentis.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.679
And know that I've got a chance

34:55.679 --> 34:58.340
of getting out of this place.

34:58.340 --> 35:00.257
Do you understand that?

35:01.237 --> 35:03.394
- You're my mother.

35:03.394 --> 35:06.821
You'll tell me anything if it
means I go to sleep on time.

35:06.821 --> 35:08.488
I should go to work.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.242
- Oh yeah, does he drive you?

35:12.242 --> 35:15.242
- Uh-huh, I'm not good on the wheel.

35:16.457 --> 35:18.957
I can't push the pedals right.

35:21.241 --> 35:24.492
I smashed the truck and all these people

35:24.492 --> 35:27.639
were real worried 'cause
Dad's face was all broken

35:27.639 --> 35:31.002
and the locals were like
who the hell are you

35:31.002 --> 35:33.713
and I was like I'm Connie,

35:33.713 --> 35:37.257
I work in a theatre a few
towns across and this is my Dad

35:37.257 --> 35:41.451
and my Mom at home, she's
Bonnie but she's sick

35:41.451 --> 35:44.708
and I'm not the brightest
button on the coat

35:44.708 --> 35:46.357
so that's why I don't think Dad

35:46.357 --> 35:49.357
will let me drive the truck anymore.

35:52.071 --> 35:53.404
- When was this?

35:55.193 --> 35:58.521
- Must've been 10 years ago now.

35:58.521 --> 35:59.812
It was gonna be in the paper

35:59.812 --> 36:03.479
but some bank robbery
or something happened.

36:04.724 --> 36:08.029
Dad was really happy
people didn't get to know

36:08.029 --> 36:11.077
about me breaking the truck.

36:11.077 --> 36:13.021
He had to go to hospital separate

36:13.021 --> 36:15.190
because he was actually quite hurt.

36:15.190 --> 36:19.273
He broke his leg, his
ankle, some ribs, his nose,

36:21.122 --> 36:23.872
I think he hurt his head as well.

36:24.794 --> 36:28.211
I didn't know the truck could go so fast.

36:29.933 --> 36:32.752
- So your Dad's sick now?

36:32.752 --> 36:33.585
- I guess.

36:34.997 --> 36:38.683
I mean when I took the pills before,

36:38.683 --> 36:43.186
like a long time ago, I'd
wake up and I'd feel funny.

36:43.186 --> 36:46.730
Not funny in a good way
or funny in a bad way,

36:46.730 --> 36:50.193
just funny in a what's going on way.

36:50.193 --> 36:53.110
Since the accident I take the pills

36:53.987 --> 36:57.489
and nothing seems to be different

36:57.489 --> 37:00.133
and I don't know what's going on.

37:00.133 --> 37:03.486
I make stuff up to get through the day.

37:03.486 --> 37:06.024
No real routine anymore.

37:06.024 --> 37:09.197
I told Dad I would be his princess

37:09.197 --> 37:11.236
if he made sure I never grew up

37:11.236 --> 37:13.531
and I never had to deal
with my wicked mother

37:13.531 --> 37:15.364
in the same way again.

37:16.199 --> 37:20.116
- So now I'm the wicked
stepmother, is that it?

37:21.084 --> 37:24.195
- Daddy made sure I never grew up.

37:24.195 --> 37:26.862
I made a bargain with the devil.

37:28.009 --> 37:29.509
I feel so ashamed.

37:32.356 --> 37:34.689
I don't know why he left me.

37:35.610 --> 37:37.267
Something used to happen every night

37:37.267 --> 37:39.262
and he'd tell me about it the next day

37:39.262 --> 37:42.653
but I was asleep so he
was really telling me

37:42.653 --> 37:43.986
about my dreams.

37:45.516 --> 37:47.305
Every month I'd have a special dream

37:47.305 --> 37:50.061
and I wouldn't wake up for days.

37:50.061 --> 37:53.061
(keyboard clicking)

38:00.859 --> 38:04.140
- Hi guys, so today I'm
gonna be talking about food.

38:04.140 --> 38:06.299
What's your favourite food?

38:06.299 --> 38:08.259
Do you like sweets, are you healthy?

38:08.259 --> 38:09.744
Are you a salad kind of person?

38:09.744 --> 38:13.099
My favourite food is definitely sweets,

38:13.099 --> 38:16.052
I've got a real sweet tooth, anything,

38:16.052 --> 38:19.778
like cute little cupcakes, I
actually bake a little bit.

38:19.778 --> 38:23.278
Yeah, it's amazing how you can stay skinny

38:24.307 --> 38:25.974
while eating sweets.

38:27.571 --> 38:30.360
I guess if that's all you eat,

38:30.360 --> 38:32.261
if that was like your main diet

38:32.261 --> 38:34.653
then maybe you're just gonna stay skinny

38:34.653 --> 38:36.328
'cause you're not getting
that much nutrition.

38:36.328 --> 38:39.555
But yeah, I should probably work on that

38:39.555 --> 38:41.504
if I'm gonna be an actor
'cause you have to have

38:41.504 --> 38:42.910
the perfect body.

38:42.910 --> 38:45.086
Anyway, what do you guys like to eat?

38:45.086 --> 38:46.392
Do you like anything green?

38:46.392 --> 38:48.526
I'm not a big fan of vegetables.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.486
I think that's part of the problem,

38:50.486 --> 38:51.986
I'm gonna have to work on that.

38:51.986 --> 38:55.903
Also exercise regimes,
what keeps you guys fit?

38:57.060 --> 38:59.998
I quite like a little
jog, go to the gym a lot.

38:59.998 --> 39:04.471
It's an opportunity to
put on a little crop top

39:04.471 --> 39:07.396
and look super cute and look
at all the cute guys at the gym

39:07.396 --> 39:11.159
so yeah, tell me about your lifestyle.

39:11.159 --> 39:12.909
Thanks guys, love ya.

39:13.823 --> 39:16.109
- Such a strange sensation.

39:16.109 --> 39:17.776
Snow on green grass,

39:20.290 --> 39:21.847
barefoot,

39:21.847 --> 39:24.597
not sure I ever felt this before.

39:26.925 --> 39:29.962
At least not that I can remember.

39:29.962 --> 39:33.217
See I just look around
as the frost glistens.

39:33.217 --> 39:36.800
Reminds me of a funeral,
cold December day.

39:39.355 --> 39:43.849
Blazing light, coffin
carried from church to grave,

39:43.849 --> 39:47.262
but that frost, that frost never let up.

39:47.262 --> 39:51.595
Sun wanted to melt it away
but there was no crystals.

39:51.595 --> 39:54.415
Well hell, they had other ideas.

39:54.415 --> 39:57.561
Like me, I've always had other ideas

39:57.561 --> 40:01.369
but now I have an envious
temptation within me.

40:01.369 --> 40:02.286
Redemption.

40:03.912 --> 40:06.245
(rewinding)

40:07.698 --> 40:08.531
The girl,

40:10.879 --> 40:14.699
I guess she was maybe
what, five feet tall.

40:14.699 --> 40:16.945
And she was not quite into the fella.

40:16.945 --> 40:18.695
Ma'am, I am so sorry.

40:19.744 --> 40:22.911
I did not realise that you were awake.

40:24.434 --> 40:27.851
I mean they have given you so many pills.

40:31.433 --> 40:33.266
I just did not notice.

40:34.573 --> 40:36.823
So what are you in, a coma?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.527
Are you now compos mentis?

40:44.046 --> 40:47.192
I do have a confession to make, Bonnie.

40:47.192 --> 40:49.192
I did kill your husband.

40:51.732 --> 40:53.612
(laughing)

40:53.612 --> 40:56.567
You see he was getting
real close with Connie.

40:56.567 --> 40:58.453
I didn't like that.

40:58.453 --> 40:59.453
Not one bit.

41:00.429 --> 41:02.012
I set him straight.

41:03.150 --> 41:07.400
I put a pitchfork through
his guts and I buried him

41:08.859 --> 41:11.442
in a field, in a shallow grave.

41:18.204 --> 41:21.537
He probably got eaten up by the animals.

41:23.222 --> 41:24.305
I don't know.

41:28.815 --> 41:32.052
And what did I do with Connie?

41:32.052 --> 41:34.713
What wouldn't I do with Connie?

41:34.713 --> 41:36.130
I trained her up.

41:39.234 --> 41:40.317
- To do what?

41:41.494 --> 41:44.453
- Do what a man might need.

41:44.453 --> 41:46.120
- And why am I here?

41:47.598 --> 41:50.371
- Well that's a good question.

41:50.371 --> 41:52.371
See here's how it works.

41:53.378 --> 41:58.128
There might be one, two, three
of us still alive in here.

42:04.290 --> 42:09.123
Or there might just be one,
two of us still alive in here.

42:13.488 --> 42:17.423
- The psychotics and
sedatives have worn off?

42:17.423 --> 42:21.173
- The other consideration
is one or two of us

42:23.298 --> 42:24.881
might also be dead.

42:29.923 --> 42:32.416
You know what, ma'am?

42:32.416 --> 42:35.833
I do believe you are coming back to life.

42:37.318 --> 42:40.101
- Are you telling me I'm dead?

42:40.101 --> 42:43.099
- Well I think you've
been as good as dead.

42:43.099 --> 42:46.849
I think Connie here
doesn't realise he's dead

42:51.024 --> 42:54.607
because my suspicion
is my skeletal remains

42:58.384 --> 43:01.801
are right in the way in some out building

43:03.848 --> 43:07.515
because I blew my brains
out with a shotgun.

43:10.810 --> 43:14.346
But why would I do something like that?

43:14.346 --> 43:16.446
Well let me tell you.

43:16.446 --> 43:18.351
That drunk accident,

43:18.351 --> 43:22.184
maybe it was a little
worse than she told you.

43:23.351 --> 43:26.101
(engine revving)

43:27.003 --> 43:30.900
See a broken bone, I could
cope with a broken bone.

43:30.900 --> 43:34.325
I'd cope with many broken bones.

43:34.325 --> 43:39.075
But maybe I couldn't cope with
my balls being ripped off.

43:40.759 --> 43:45.009
Or is that me just being
a little too melodramatic?

44:13.997 --> 44:18.676
- [Connie] Okay, seat
belt on, look to the left,

44:18.676 --> 44:22.471
right round, look right round to the right

44:22.471 --> 44:26.138
and engine, oh, check
it's in neutral first,

44:27.670 --> 44:32.587
oh, okay, engine on, handbrake
up, look again and move off.

44:49.430 --> 44:50.754
- [Woman] The drugs ran out, Connie,

44:50.754 --> 44:53.424
you should've realised a long time ago.

44:53.424 --> 44:55.786
- I just do what the man pays me to do.

44:55.786 --> 44:58.154
I come here every day and do this.

44:58.154 --> 44:59.517
- [Woman] What does
the man tell you to do?

44:59.517 --> 45:02.934
- I give you your drugs, I supervise you,

45:03.879 --> 45:06.129
I give you a daily workout.

45:07.368 --> 45:09.612
- [Woman] Then you're not my daughter.

45:09.612 --> 45:11.172
- No, why would I be?

45:11.172 --> 45:14.201
- [Woman] 'Cause you're
coming to my house.

45:14.201 --> 45:15.212
- I care for you, Mrs. Castille.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.396
- [Woman] Mrs. Castille?

45:16.396 --> 45:18.137
That's a new one.

45:18.137 --> 45:20.812
- No, I'm not new, we just
haven't talked much before now.

45:20.812 --> 45:22.960
- [Woman] Yes, I'm aware of that, Connie.

45:22.960 --> 45:24.375
- How'd you know my name?

45:24.375 --> 45:26.462
- [Woman] Something happened to us, dear.

45:26.462 --> 45:28.785
Something, we just need to
figure out what it was and when

45:28.785 --> 45:31.285
and then we can find a way out of here.

45:31.285 --> 45:32.499
- You think we're trapped?

45:32.499 --> 45:35.057
- [Woman] That's an understatement.

45:35.057 --> 45:36.778
- Do you think David has
something to do with this?

45:36.778 --> 45:38.553
- [Woman] Is David your Dad?
- No.

45:38.553 --> 45:41.207
- [Woman] Wake up, Connie.

45:41.207 --> 45:43.442
David is definitely your Dad.

45:43.442 --> 45:45.490
- Then why would he do this?

45:45.490 --> 45:47.073
- [Woman] Jealousy.

45:48.389 --> 45:50.159
- What if he's not jealous?

45:50.159 --> 45:52.745
- [Woman] Why wouldn't he be?

45:52.745 --> 45:54.478
- Got all his questions, haven't I?

45:54.478 --> 45:56.417
- [Woman] In a way.

45:56.417 --> 45:58.500
- I don't know who's who.

46:02.396 --> 46:06.083
- [Woman] I just had this
conversation with David.

46:06.083 --> 46:09.048
- Now you're having it with me.

46:09.048 --> 46:13.441
- [Woman] That's 'cause
you did this to yourself.

46:13.441 --> 46:16.597
- I'm alone in here, aren't I?

46:16.597 --> 46:20.514
I don't talk to you and Dad anymore, do I?

46:20.514 --> 46:23.306
- [Woman] Connie, there might
be someone here to see you.

46:23.306 --> 46:27.508
- Might, that's all
I've heard all my life,

46:27.508 --> 46:29.508
maybe and might, Mother.

46:31.058 --> 46:35.071
I'm not fucking perfect like
you, do you realise that?

46:35.071 --> 46:37.404
Vein and insipid and broken.

46:39.368 --> 46:41.780
- [Woman] No Connie, there's
someone here to see you.

46:41.780 --> 46:43.630
They want to talk to you upstairs.

46:43.630 --> 46:45.894
You need to get up and go
and find out who it is.

46:45.894 --> 46:47.431
I just spoke with your Daddy,

46:47.431 --> 46:51.431
he's gonna try and get
you another job, just go.

46:54.332 --> 46:55.814
- Okay, I'll go see.

46:55.814 --> 46:58.564
(engine revving)

47:03.141 --> 47:05.724
(car crashing)

47:12.613 --> 47:15.363
(dramatic music)

47:41.268 --> 47:43.083
- Yeah, I was driving towards Hastings

47:43.083 --> 47:45.135
and a girl flagged down my car

47:45.135 --> 47:47.571
and practically jumped
into the passenger seat

47:47.571 --> 47:50.238
from the beach near Win-chelsea.

47:51.455 --> 47:55.205
She's clearly distraught,
she's clearly very ill

47:55.205 --> 47:58.641
and she's clearly in need of
immediate medical attention

47:58.641 --> 48:00.340
so I'm taking her
straight to the hospital.

48:00.340 --> 48:03.254
Can you be there to meet me?

48:03.254 --> 48:05.982
I think she must've come from a property

48:05.982 --> 48:07.986
or maybe a car accident

48:07.986 --> 48:11.169
from the Kent-East
Sussex border somewhere,

48:11.169 --> 48:14.455
I don't know, that's
just purely speculation

48:14.455 --> 48:16.955
but she's really very ill and.

48:21.326 --> 48:23.326
Donald Mark Hamlet, Don.

48:28.253 --> 48:30.086
She keeps passing out.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.783
Just keep the line open, wait.

48:37.555 --> 48:40.276
Now I'm gonna take you
to a hospital, alright?

48:40.276 --> 48:41.903
What can I call you?

48:41.903 --> 48:44.486
I'm on the phone to the police.

48:48.164 --> 48:48.997
- Connie.

48:50.842 --> 48:52.925
My name's Connie, I'm 16.

48:55.562 --> 48:57.702
- Yeah, I don't want to be tactless Connie

48:57.702 --> 48:59.952
but I'm not sure you're 16.

49:04.471 --> 49:06.304
- No, no you're right.

49:08.558 --> 49:10.700
My name's Bonnie and I'm 46,

49:10.700 --> 49:13.140
Connie's my daughter, she's 16.

49:13.140 --> 49:16.890
- Yeah okay, stay calm
and you'll be alright.

49:18.289 --> 49:21.439
- Connie, my name's Connie Castille,

49:21.439 --> 49:24.772
I'm 31, in 2007 or 2008 I did something,

49:29.826 --> 49:34.576
I recognise you, I don't know
where I've been since then.

49:35.993 --> 49:38.006
Can you write this down before I forget?

49:38.006 --> 49:39.590
- Alright, that makes the most sense

49:39.590 --> 49:42.038
out of everything you've said so far.

49:42.038 --> 49:44.788
Are you getting this on the line?

49:45.791 --> 49:48.645
- What do you mean it
makes the most sense?

49:48.645 --> 49:51.478
(speaker muffled)

49:52.854 --> 49:55.452
- Look, so far you've said that you are

49:55.452 --> 49:57.361
your 46 year old mother,

49:57.361 --> 50:00.778
then you said you're 50-odd year old Dad,

50:01.821 --> 50:05.579
you said you're your Dad's
dead Filipino wife Na-gay-a

50:05.579 --> 50:08.093
and you also said you were your Dad's

50:08.093 --> 50:10.093
baby daughter, Princess.

50:12.185 --> 50:14.852
(ominous music)

50:28.831 --> 50:30.527
- [Charles] Hi Sam, it's Charles.

50:30.527 --> 50:32.169
What else have we got?

50:32.169 --> 50:34.586
- Nothing yet, oh, we got
the man who found her.

50:34.586 --> 50:36.558
- [Charles] All right, well who is it?

50:36.558 --> 50:39.599
- Director of a film
she was in 12 years ago.

50:39.599 --> 50:42.712
He found her because
he was looking for her.

50:42.712 --> 50:45.274
- [Charles] That's media gold, right?

50:45.274 --> 50:46.880
- Don't be insensitive.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.953
- [Charles] I mean come on,
that's award winning stuff.

50:48.953 --> 50:50.786
- Our source found us.

50:51.970 --> 50:54.500
This girl, she's isn't a compos.

50:54.500 --> 50:57.520
- [Charles] She doesn't need to be.

50:57.520 --> 51:00.279
- No, we're talking whatever
happened to baby Jane.

51:00.279 --> 51:02.902
- [Charles] Psycho baby,
what, is it some kind

51:02.902 --> 51:04.316
of film genre convention?

51:04.316 --> 51:07.161
- Maybe, look, this girl
is really not that well

51:07.161 --> 51:08.911
and there might be two of 'em.

51:08.911 --> 51:10.711
- [Charles] What do you
mean there are two of them?

51:10.711 --> 51:12.044
- Well speculation only,

51:12.044 --> 51:16.008
look, she might have been
in there with her mother.

51:16.008 --> 51:17.894
Father might be an instigator

51:17.894 --> 51:19.644
for a decade or more.

51:20.707 --> 51:22.974
- [Charles] Hillbillies in Hastings.

51:22.974 --> 51:25.550
Alright, let's see where this goes.

51:25.550 --> 51:28.447
- You know Sky might use
it as their main feed

51:28.447 --> 51:30.278
if they can't get their own
people down quick enough.

51:30.278 --> 51:32.092
There's been a big
accident on the motorway.

51:32.092 --> 51:34.631
The traffic Gods, they might be with you.

51:34.631 --> 51:38.501
- [Charles] Alright, I'm
walking and I'm talking.

51:38.501 --> 51:40.552
Terry is next to me if I'm not answering

51:40.552 --> 51:42.552
so I'll give you a call.

52:03.179 --> 52:05.846
(siren wailing)

52:08.101 --> 52:11.177
- And now for some breaking
news on a developing situation

52:11.177 --> 52:13.314
near Hastings, East Sussex.

52:13.314 --> 52:16.199
Initially reported on social media outlets

52:16.199 --> 52:19.471
by the student run Parallel News Service,

52:19.471 --> 52:21.626
a woman's claim that she
has been held captive

52:21.626 --> 52:24.371
for the past 11 years has escalated

52:24.371 --> 52:27.372
into a major police operation.

52:27.372 --> 52:28.810
Details are currently limited.

52:28.810 --> 52:32.110
The first pictures we have
are of reporter Terry Bennum

52:32.110 --> 52:34.491
courtesy of Parallel News Service,

52:34.491 --> 52:38.189
but we do know that this is
an ongoing hostage situation

52:38.189 --> 52:41.430
at an undisclosed rural location.

52:41.430 --> 52:44.785
Speculation suggests this
is an issue of geography

52:44.785 --> 52:47.552
and access but it is
understood that the woman found

52:47.552 --> 52:51.222
was a former actress who in recent months

52:51.222 --> 52:53.496
was the subject of an Internet campaign

52:53.496 --> 52:56.499
to locate her exact whereabouts.

52:56.499 --> 52:57.939
We'll bring you more on this story

52:57.939 --> 53:00.772
as it develops throughout the day.

53:04.908 --> 53:06.919
- Darling, you also said that you'd thrown

53:06.919 --> 53:09.199
a pan of boiling water over your mother

53:09.199 --> 53:11.460
and that you locked
your Dad in the bathroom

53:11.460 --> 53:14.293
after you'd offered him a blowjob.

53:15.376 --> 53:20.043
Yeah, I can do weird, but
you've been through something.

53:21.741 --> 53:22.824
- I know you.

53:26.564 --> 53:28.231
- What do I do then?

53:29.311 --> 53:30.561
- I don't know.

53:32.132 --> 53:33.794
You knocked on my door.

53:33.794 --> 53:36.180
- No, no you stopped my car

53:36.180 --> 53:37.956
and you got in the passenger seat.

53:37.956 --> 53:40.733
I was looking for someone at the beach

53:40.733 --> 53:43.211
who matched your description.

53:43.211 --> 53:45.378
- You were looking for me.

53:48.570 --> 53:51.280
- I don't think I was looking for you

53:51.280 --> 53:52.876
but I found you alright.

53:52.876 --> 53:53.793
- You were.

53:55.144 --> 53:56.810
You were looking for me.

53:56.810 --> 53:59.904
I can't believe you were looking for me.

53:59.904 --> 54:02.293
I can't believe you found me.

54:02.293 --> 54:04.293
You were looking for me.

54:06.218 --> 54:07.458
I can't believe you were looking for me.

54:07.458 --> 54:09.875
I can't believe you found me.

54:12.675 --> 54:16.342
- I'm not sure I was
looking looking for you

54:17.418 --> 54:19.918
but yeah, I found you alright.

54:21.792 --> 54:22.875
- Bebe Marie.

54:25.010 --> 54:27.927
It's the name I put down on a form.

54:30.023 --> 54:31.106
- Bebe Marie.

54:37.148 --> 54:38.231
- Bebe Marie.

54:40.769 --> 54:43.436
It's the name I put on the form.

54:45.048 --> 54:46.131
- Bebe Marie.

54:49.681 --> 54:54.264
How the hell would you know
that name if it wasn't you?

54:57.302 --> 54:59.885
Yeah, this girl, I think I have

55:02.135 --> 55:04.635
actually been looking for her.

55:05.723 --> 55:07.831
- [Charles] So, strategy?

55:07.831 --> 55:09.310
- The meeting.

55:09.310 --> 55:10.801
Bring 'em on board.

55:10.801 --> 55:11.921
- [Charles] What if he wants a fee?

55:11.921 --> 55:13.878
What if he's got media assets?

55:13.878 --> 55:15.915
- I'll get onto legal.

55:15.915 --> 55:17.755
We're gonna need a bigger
outlet piggybacking this

55:17.755 --> 55:19.174
if this gets big.

55:19.174 --> 55:22.876
Our resources, they can be a bit limited.

55:22.876 --> 55:24.702
- [Charles] Am I the priority reporter

55:24.702 --> 55:26.535
or is this on Theresa?

55:28.481 --> 55:30.088
- Big networks, they might use you today,

55:30.088 --> 55:32.394
but if it goes up a gear
we'll slip the journos,

55:32.394 --> 55:33.540
will be all over it.

55:33.540 --> 55:35.706
- [Charles] I wanna say
again, we need extra research.

55:35.706 --> 55:36.565
- No, not yet.

55:36.565 --> 55:38.481
This could be a smokescreen.

55:38.481 --> 55:39.567
- [Charles] See, even you think

55:39.567 --> 55:41.028
the real scandal is elsewhere.

55:41.028 --> 55:43.115
- Maybe, it's not your usual story

55:43.115 --> 55:46.184
to come out of this area
of the country, is it?

55:46.184 --> 55:47.017
Keep tabs.

55:56.372 --> 56:00.186
- Just go online, it's been in the media.

56:00.186 --> 56:01.686
Look up find Bebe.

56:04.035 --> 56:07.452
Alright, it's not massive but it's there.

56:08.425 --> 56:10.563
If it is the right girl,

56:10.563 --> 56:15.187
then she was an actor in one
of my movies a few years ago

56:15.187 --> 56:16.854
and she disappeared.

56:22.588 --> 56:23.421
Bebe,

56:25.999 --> 56:27.916
we thought you gave up.

56:32.103 --> 56:34.986
- I don't know where I am.

56:34.986 --> 56:37.234
I don't know what to say.

56:37.234 --> 56:39.771
I don't know what's real.

56:39.771 --> 56:41.551
- We're safe.

56:41.551 --> 56:44.218
But I think you're quite unwell.

56:45.341 --> 56:47.443
- Where are we going?

56:47.443 --> 56:51.860
- I'm gonna take you straight
to a hospital, alright?

56:53.598 --> 56:55.054
Yeah, 20 minutes.

56:55.054 --> 56:56.782
- Am I okay?

56:56.782 --> 57:00.865
- Yeah we can get there
faster than an ambulance.

57:08.760 --> 57:11.760
I don't know, she keeps passing out.

57:15.469 --> 57:17.469
No, I'm fine, I'm sober,

57:19.062 --> 57:20.562
I'm just in shock.

57:28.660 --> 57:29.493
Yeah okay.

57:33.896 --> 57:38.896
Look, I don't know, last time
I saw her was 10, 11 years ago

57:39.064 --> 57:40.731
but now here she is.

57:45.811 --> 57:47.569
- Look it's the hottest day of the year.

57:47.569 --> 57:49.600
I've been running around
from pilar to post

57:49.600 --> 57:52.127
trying to get all this
information for you, alright?

57:52.127 --> 57:55.989
It might not be her, basement dungeon,

57:55.989 --> 57:58.652
the mother slash wife
have been kept sedated

57:58.652 --> 58:01.423
on anti-psychotics but they
ran out a few months ago.

58:01.423 --> 58:03.886
The bad man went away and the poor girl

58:03.886 --> 58:06.799
got compos mentis as she came out.

58:06.799 --> 58:10.882
That's practically torture
on side effects alone.

58:14.651 --> 58:18.272
- [Charles] Now my name
is Charles Barberry.

58:18.272 --> 58:21.022
I work for Parallel News Service.

58:22.365 --> 58:25.649
You'd have met two of
my guys on the beach,

58:25.649 --> 58:27.816
Terry, she's our reporter,

58:29.131 --> 58:31.143
she's only a student at the moment,

58:31.143 --> 58:34.143
and Sam would've been the cameraman.

58:36.446 --> 58:39.878
Now what's going on here sounds pretty big

58:39.878 --> 58:42.919
so we've got our main journo coming down,

58:42.919 --> 58:46.677
her name is Theresa but
she won't be with you

58:46.677 --> 58:48.696
for a couple of hours yet.

58:48.696 --> 58:52.113
So, Donald, I'm on the beach in question.

58:54.627 --> 58:56.367
Where are you, you can't miss it?

58:56.367 --> 58:57.867
- Yeah, I see you.

58:59.482 --> 59:03.511
- [Charles] Okay, well, thanks
for talking with us then.

59:03.511 --> 59:05.025
- Do you know what's happening?

59:05.025 --> 59:07.265
- [Charles] No idea other
than the girl is critical

59:07.265 --> 59:10.661
and it's an active hostage situation.

59:10.661 --> 59:12.594
Is that how much you know?

59:12.594 --> 59:13.448
- Pretty much.

59:13.448 --> 59:14.305
- [Charles] Well come on,

59:14.305 --> 59:16.266
you gotta start filling us in, please.

59:16.266 --> 59:17.796
- You read about the campaign?

59:17.796 --> 59:19.749
- [Charles] Find Bebe Marie.

59:19.749 --> 59:23.398
- Yeah, so about 12 years
ago we made this film.

59:23.398 --> 59:25.799
We changed the name and it blew up,

59:25.799 --> 59:28.640
as much as a small indie film can blow up.

59:28.640 --> 59:31.413
Got bought by a studio so
they could remake all of it,

59:31.413 --> 59:34.871
or at least parts of it when they saw fit.

59:34.871 --> 59:37.674
Anyway, I end up with a huge check.

59:37.674 --> 59:39.089
- [Charles] How much is a big check?

59:39.089 --> 59:40.311
- Well after all the tax,

59:40.311 --> 59:44.527
obviously it came from the
US first, about 200 grand.

59:44.527 --> 59:47.541
Not so much to show for such a big amount

59:47.541 --> 59:50.321
but I decided to do the right thing,

59:50.321 --> 59:53.057
split it through the cast and crew.

59:53.057 --> 59:57.821
Bebe was due to get a check
for about three grand,

59:57.821 --> 01:00:02.821
nothing major but enough for
something out of the blue.

01:00:02.916 --> 01:00:04.033
- [Charles] And this is what you went

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:07.200
to give to her last night, am I right?

01:00:10.817 --> 01:00:12.491
- Yes and no.

01:00:12.491 --> 01:00:14.539
- [Charles] What do you mean yes and no?

01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:17.230
- We never actually knew where she lived.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:19.690
We never kept any record

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.940
and that girl is not Bebe Marie at all.

01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:27.472
- [Charles] Do you really want to tell me

01:00:27.472 --> 01:00:29.222
this next bit or not?

01:00:30.237 --> 01:00:32.383
- Why wouldn't I?

01:00:32.383 --> 01:00:33.991
- [Charles] My luck will be on this

01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:38.584
like flies round fucking
shit, do you understand?

01:00:38.584 --> 01:00:41.167
- Better ask me first then, hm?

01:00:44.078 --> 01:00:46.578
- [Charles] Who is Bebe Marie?

01:00:47.837 --> 01:00:50.619
- Connie Louise Castille.

01:00:50.619 --> 01:00:53.071
But I only ever dealt with her as Bebe.

01:00:53.071 --> 01:00:55.251
It pisses me off when people don't call me

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.828
by my professional name.

01:00:57.828 --> 01:01:01.661
Earnest Hartley is not
director Donald Hamlet.

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:04.931
(laughing)

01:01:06.814 --> 01:01:09.733
- [Charles] Terry's
there with you, I assume.

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:11.144
Is this the girl we're thinking of?

01:01:11.144 --> 01:01:13.855
- Daughter of Bonnie Castille.

01:01:13.855 --> 01:01:15.400
- You know who these people are?

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.765
- [Charles] Yeah, they once
had an arterial connection

01:01:18.765 --> 01:01:20.598
to a big media family.

01:01:21.766 --> 01:01:25.564
Family feud, connections were
cut, something like that.

01:01:25.564 --> 01:01:29.981
- So what did Bebe's Dad,
I'm sorry, Connie's Dad do?

01:01:31.123 --> 01:01:32.040
- Castille?

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:36.402
Fuck if he's done something like this.

01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:38.186
- [Charles] He had a Filipino wife,

01:01:38.186 --> 01:01:41.792
died during childbirth, child
died shortly afterwards,

01:01:41.792 --> 01:01:44.316
then he came back to the UK.

01:01:44.316 --> 01:01:45.813
He was investigated for fraud

01:01:45.813 --> 01:01:50.063
and doing everything he
shouldn't have done abroad.

01:01:51.187 --> 01:01:53.860
- So who you gonna call?

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.042
- [Charles] Well I'm thinking aloud.

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:57.842
Terry, thoughts?

01:01:57.842 --> 01:02:00.053
- This could be massive.

01:02:00.053 --> 01:02:02.122
- This story needs integrity.

01:02:02.122 --> 01:02:03.812
That girl was a mess.

01:02:03.812 --> 01:02:05.294
I can't exploit her.

01:02:05.294 --> 01:02:07.008
- We're exploiting the story,

01:02:07.008 --> 01:02:08.667
that's what we do in the media.

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:13.584
- Yeah, I understand, which is
why you need me as an asset.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.510
(waves crashing)

01:02:31.678 --> 01:02:32.900
- Police in southern England

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.452
are slowly releasing the details

01:02:34.452 --> 01:02:38.531
of what they call a major
captivity incident in Hastings.

01:02:38.531 --> 01:02:40.845
A young woman was found in a rural lane

01:02:40.845 --> 01:02:42.904
after having escaped capture.

01:02:42.904 --> 01:02:44.445
- [Charles] Police have
cancelled a press conference

01:02:44.445 --> 01:02:45.655
but they have issued a statement.

01:02:45.655 --> 01:02:46.613
- Tell me.

01:02:46.613 --> 01:02:50.903
- [Charles] Absolute media
blackout until further notice.

01:02:50.903 --> 01:02:52.881
- That's not normal, anything else?

01:02:52.881 --> 01:02:55.381
- [Charles] Surprisingly yeah.

01:02:57.744 --> 01:03:00.276
She's currently in a critical condition.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.104
All media cooperation is essential.

01:03:02.104 --> 01:03:03.797
No leaks on social, please.

01:03:03.797 --> 01:03:07.964
They're hammering this,
they want everything dark.

01:03:11.778 --> 01:03:14.028
(slamming)

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:25.702
- [Connie] A young
princess has disappeared.

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:28.199
Held captive by people masquerading

01:03:28.199 --> 01:03:30.220
as her father and mother.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.737
She endures terrible hardship.

01:03:32.737 --> 01:03:36.900
Plotting escape, she uses
all of her wit and cunning

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.314
to kill the mean man and
make the woman suffer.

01:03:41.314 --> 01:03:43.400
Using the Internet as her only means

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.550
of communication with the outside world,

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:49.691
she makes the world start the
hunt to find the princess.

01:03:49.691 --> 01:03:52.304
- What the fuck are we dealing with here?

01:03:52.304 --> 01:03:55.554
- This is meticulous planning of years.

01:03:56.652 --> 01:03:58.712
- You really think that's the case?

01:03:58.712 --> 01:04:02.411
You're suggesting everything
that girl has done

01:04:02.411 --> 01:04:04.581
may be written in that manuscript?

01:04:04.581 --> 01:04:08.025
- Yeah, that's pretty
much what I'm saying.

01:04:08.025 --> 01:04:10.527
- You can all go fuck yourselves
and get out of my head

01:04:10.527 --> 01:04:13.356
because all I know is she might
have been through something

01:04:13.356 --> 01:04:16.783
and I'm gonna stick by her and sell her

01:04:16.783 --> 01:04:20.533
because that is what's
gonna sell this story.

01:04:23.152 --> 01:04:25.201
- [Man] All the Hollywood stuff,

01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:26.859
that actually plays out.

01:04:26.859 --> 01:04:31.533
She was in quite a few
films between 1984 and 1989.

01:04:31.533 --> 01:04:33.866
You see she had some talent.

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:39.251
She was whisked off to LA as an artist

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:41.512
of extraordinary ability,

01:04:41.512 --> 01:04:43.384
that's how she got a visa.

01:04:43.384 --> 01:04:46.851
She got representation and then she turned

01:04:46.851 --> 01:04:50.870
into a bit of a bad girl,
got a bad reputation

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:54.244
and then she found her
way back to England.

01:04:54.244 --> 01:04:57.404
- What is actually wrong with Connie?

01:04:57.404 --> 01:04:59.863
And cut out the bullshit.

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:03.284
- Okay, she had a few cuts and bruises.

01:05:03.284 --> 01:05:06.966
Nothing anyone couldn't not
conceivably have on them

01:05:06.966 --> 01:05:10.035
in their normal day to day life.

01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:14.436
In fact, the doctors really
had to look for them.

01:05:14.436 --> 01:05:16.853
She was grabby on the outside

01:05:18.464 --> 01:05:21.214
but I will be unrepeatably crude.

01:05:24.844 --> 01:05:26.635
I didn't do the examination.

01:05:26.635 --> 01:05:30.548
Obviously your girlfriend
Vivian did and her team

01:05:30.548 --> 01:05:33.969
but being the push media man that I am

01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:36.552
I was practically ever present.

01:05:37.505 --> 01:05:40.050
But just so you've got this information

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:44.967
from the ether as such, I quote
one of Vivian's colleagues,

01:05:47.729 --> 01:05:51.755
girls who've been held
captive for 10 years

01:05:51.755 --> 01:05:53.672
usually aren't virgins.

01:05:58.277 --> 01:06:01.231
- [Charles] Listen up, you're
not gonna believe this.

01:06:01.231 --> 01:06:05.648
So, our man in question who
might be behind all this,

01:06:09.543 --> 01:06:11.376
David Ronald Castille.

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:14.458
- The pissing fuck, what?

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:17.500
- [Charles] The girl is Connie Castille.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.003
The thing with Donald,
he doesn't want money

01:06:20.003 --> 01:06:22.745
but we may have to treat him as an asset.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.293
- Fuck me, I'll get ground of my Mom.

01:06:24.293 --> 01:06:26.505
Budget directly authorised.

01:06:26.505 --> 01:06:29.033
Let's keep this thing moving.

01:06:29.033 --> 01:06:30.375
Castille?

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:33.030
Fuck if he's done something like this.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.530
- [Charles] I need more researchers on it.

01:06:37.566 --> 01:06:40.592
- We'll build it, the
blackout's being respected

01:06:40.592 --> 01:06:42.398
so we've got time.

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:44.537
- [Charles] Look, we're
playing this straight

01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:47.006
but just remember we've
got two angles on this.

01:06:47.006 --> 01:06:50.611
We've got the girl's version of events

01:06:50.611 --> 01:06:53.549
and we've got the best friend, Vivian.

01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:56.716
Something's not right here, keep tabs.

(camera snapping)

01:08:15.988 --> 01:08:19.421
- Are you sure you're ready
to deliver this interview?

01:08:19.421 --> 01:08:23.877
- I've been waiting to give
this interview for 10 years.

01:08:23.877 --> 01:08:26.417
- And it was a car crash that
you were in with your father

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:28.616
that really paved the way to freedom?

01:08:28.616 --> 01:08:32.091
- Yeah, I mean what I didn't understand

01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:35.366
was while I was mentally captive 100%,

01:08:35.366 --> 01:08:39.339
physically I could've actually
got out if I wanted to.

01:08:39.339 --> 01:08:44.171
I just didn't grasp that because
the abuse was so endemic.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.635
As I said, I actually
had a job to begin with

01:08:47.635 --> 01:08:52.635
and I was always told I wasn't
allowed to speak so I didn't.

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:59.654
And for one job he was
teaching me how to drive

01:08:59.654 --> 01:09:03.969
but I wasn't very good
at it and we hit a fence.

01:09:03.969 --> 01:09:07.346
I was wearing my seatbelt but he wasn't

01:09:07.346 --> 01:09:09.401
and he was badly hurt.

01:09:09.401 --> 01:09:12.129
These people turned up,
pulled him out of the car,

01:09:12.129 --> 01:09:14.741
we went to hospital but
because I was always told

01:09:14.741 --> 01:09:18.603
I wasn't allowed to speak,
they thought I was simple

01:09:18.603 --> 01:09:21.313
and everything was just arranged for me

01:09:21.313 --> 01:09:24.085
and I found myself back in
the house and that was it.

01:09:24.085 --> 01:09:28.027
- And do you remember just
how badly he was injured?

01:09:28.027 --> 01:09:31.194
- I just remember the smell of bleach.

01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:34.868
- [Interviewer] Why bleach?

01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:37.573
- In the truck that day
in the passenger foot well

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.617
and on his lap were all
these cleaning supplies

01:09:40.617 --> 01:09:42.194
we just bought.

01:09:42.194 --> 01:09:44.334
Normally stuff like that
would go in the boot

01:09:44.334 --> 01:09:46.751
but I said I wanted to drive.

01:09:48.187 --> 01:09:50.608
(speaker drowned out by ominous music)

01:09:50.608 --> 01:09:53.191
(car crashing)

01:09:57.403 --> 01:10:00.342
- And your mother was still in the house?

01:10:00.342 --> 01:10:02.175
- At that point, yeah.

01:10:04.064 --> 01:10:08.231
- [Interviewer] So--
- Sorry, I just need a minute.

01:10:23.896 --> 01:10:26.097
I can't believe you are
both still here for me,

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:28.793
you've been such a massive help.

01:10:28.793 --> 01:10:31.876
I love you so much, Don, I really do.

01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:38.772
- We're just helping you through.

01:10:38.772 --> 01:10:41.142
- No, I think it's much more than that.

01:10:41.142 --> 01:10:42.778
- It isn't.

01:10:42.778 --> 01:10:45.168
I think you should talk
to that production guy.

01:10:45.168 --> 01:10:46.001
- Why?

01:10:47.064 --> 01:10:49.469
- I don't think he's
getting enough credit.

01:10:49.469 --> 01:10:51.447
If it wasn't for him,

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:54.619
I never would've been able to find you.

01:10:54.619 --> 01:10:56.627
- I'll take him out for dinner.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:59.877
Stop hassling me, we've got shit to do.

01:11:08.273 --> 01:11:10.681
- [Woman] Where's your Dad now?

01:11:10.681 --> 01:11:13.556
- I was gonna ask you that.

01:11:13.556 --> 01:11:17.561
See, I don't think I've left
the house in about a year.

01:11:17.561 --> 01:11:20.061
Not as pretty as I used to be.

01:11:21.021 --> 01:11:24.068
- [Woman] What about your job?

01:11:24.068 --> 01:11:27.699
- I wasn't good at it anyway,
they had to let me go.

01:11:27.699 --> 01:11:28.866
- [Woman] Why?

01:11:31.072 --> 01:11:34.821
- This man wanted me to
do stuff in the toilets

01:11:34.821 --> 01:11:38.231
and then he gave me a load of money.

01:11:38.231 --> 01:11:43.231
My manager found out and he
said it was the last straw.

01:11:43.408 --> 01:11:44.241
- Jesus.

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:50.387
And no one's realised you've
been sick all this time?

01:11:51.515 --> 01:11:54.432
- This all just happened one night.

01:11:56.528 --> 01:12:01.255
I think it was after I crashed
the truck, I don't know.

01:12:01.255 --> 01:12:04.238
- What was your job, Connie?

01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:06.988
- [Connie] I was like a waitress.

01:12:13.242 --> 01:12:15.565
- [Woman] What year are we in?

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:18.086
- I don't know what year I'm in.

01:12:18.086 --> 01:12:20.669
- [Woman] How can you not know?

01:12:24.323 --> 01:12:26.463
- Dad always said you were just sleeping

01:12:26.463 --> 01:12:29.383
but we needed to make sure
your body was still working

01:12:29.383 --> 01:12:31.883
so I gave you a daily workout.

01:12:33.789 --> 01:12:37.622
- [Woman] Connie, when
did I actually wake up?

01:12:38.638 --> 01:12:39.555
- Properly?

01:12:41.029 --> 01:12:42.196
A few months ago.

01:12:42.196 --> 01:12:44.113
- [Woman] A few months?

01:12:44.971 --> 01:12:49.138
- It's like you woke up
and you were normal again.

01:12:50.267 --> 01:12:55.215
- [Woman] So how long do you
think I've been asleep for?

01:12:55.215 --> 01:12:57.298
- Before the truck smash.

01:12:59.049 --> 01:13:02.824
Barack Obama was the President of the USA.

01:13:02.824 --> 01:13:04.991
- [Woman] Can we watch TV?

01:13:05.954 --> 01:13:07.159
- It's your house.

01:13:07.159 --> 01:13:08.954
- [Woman] No, it's not my house.

01:13:08.954 --> 01:13:11.173
I'm just a guest.

01:13:11.173 --> 01:13:12.673
So where is David?

01:13:14.339 --> 01:13:16.827
- He hasn't come home and
that's why we're here,

01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:19.178
that's why nothing's
getting done around here.

01:13:19.178 --> 01:13:20.428
- Are you sure?

01:13:32.368 --> 01:13:36.075
Are you ever going to tell the truth?

01:13:36.075 --> 01:13:38.575
- What truth is there to tell?

01:13:41.866 --> 01:13:44.185
I'm Connie Castille.

01:13:44.185 --> 01:13:46.768
I'm the princess in the castle.

01:13:49.359 --> 01:13:52.268
And for the rest of my
life I'll sell papers.

01:13:52.268 --> 01:13:55.150
For the rest of my life
I'll sell TV shows,

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:57.895
books, films, documentaries.

01:13:57.895 --> 01:14:01.062
People love me because I'm a survivor.

01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:03.100
- Are you?

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:07.204
- What did I tell you when we were kids?

01:14:07.204 --> 01:14:09.763
- Many delusional things, Connie.

01:14:09.763 --> 01:14:11.511
- No, I said I was happy for my life

01:14:11.511 --> 01:14:13.974
to be the perfect illusion.

01:14:13.974 --> 01:14:16.057
12 years old, year seven,

01:14:16.951 --> 01:14:19.820
I told you I'd make you famous one day.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:24.118
Well, you're not as
famous as me, obviously,

01:14:24.118 --> 01:14:27.450
but you're getting there
miss celebrity doctor.

01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:30.598
You counsel the rich and
famous now, don't you?

01:14:30.598 --> 01:14:32.348
Who got you that job?

01:14:33.398 --> 01:14:36.252
I better finish the interview.

01:14:36.252 --> 01:14:38.643
She's just getting scraps.

01:14:38.643 --> 01:14:42.362
Once this airs the phone
won't stop ringing.

01:14:42.362 --> 01:14:45.286
- Just don't tell them you
shot your Dad in the face

01:14:45.286 --> 01:14:48.062
in the garage and left
him to bleed to death.

01:14:48.062 --> 01:14:50.819
- I didn't and that was self inflicted.

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:53.916
- You mean he pulled the
trigger because you told him to.

01:14:53.916 --> 01:14:57.249
- Princesses don't pull triggers.

01:14:57.249 --> 01:14:59.425
- Princesses poison their wicked mothers

01:14:59.425 --> 01:15:01.753
and push them down the stairs though.

01:15:01.753 --> 01:15:02.670
- She fell.

01:15:03.728 --> 01:15:07.805
I did what I was told
under extreme duress.

01:15:07.805 --> 01:15:11.638
- Let's see how long you
can keep this up for.

01:15:14.822 --> 01:15:16.822
- 12 years and counting.
