WEBVTT

00:00.571 --> 00:10.141
в™Єв™Є

00:10.141 --> 00:11.642
WHAT?

00:11.642 --> 00:13.644
HONEY, WHEN YOU WRITE
A COLLEGE ESSAY,

00:13.644 --> 00:16.117
YOU NEED TO WRITE
ABOUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

00:16.117 --> 00:18.119
NOT WHO YOU PRETEND TO BE,
OKAY?

00:18.119 --> 00:21.492
SO NO MORE STUFF ABOUT HOW
YOU'RE A HUGE FAN OF THE CLASH.
I LOVE THE CLASH.

00:21.492 --> 00:24.155
NAME ONE OF THEIR SONGS.
"SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO."

00:24.155 --> 00:26.457
NAME ANOTHER.
WELL PLAYED,
BUT IF YOU TORTURE ME,

00:26.457 --> 00:29.800
I'M GONNA TORTURE YOU.
I'M GOING TO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.133
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL ALONE.
I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR YOU.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.705
OH! REALLY, MOM?
(dish clatters)

00:34.705 --> 00:37.108
MOM?
(voice breaks)
I NEED A SEC.

00:37.108 --> 00:39.540
(telephone rings, beep)
HELLO?

00:39.540 --> 00:44.115
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S MIDNIGHT, AND I'M TRYING
NOT TO CRY IN FRONT OF MY SON.

00:44.115 --> 00:47.118
(dance music playing)
(slurred) THAT'S COOL.
SO REMEMBER HOW NEZZIE AND I

00:47.118 --> 00:49.080
WENT TO MIAMI,
AND WE SPLIT A HOTEL ROOM?

00:49.080 --> 00:51.622
Well, tonight she said
that I hogged the bed

00:51.622 --> 00:54.655
LIKE A BIG, BLONDE BEAR,
AND I KIND OF OVERREACTED,

00:54.655 --> 00:57.128
AND I SLAPPED THE BITCH.
OHH.

00:57.128 --> 00:59.330
I'M P.M.S.ing HARD.

00:59.330 --> 01:03.063
CUT TO THE CHASE.
She left me at a club,
so I need a ride home

01:03.063 --> 01:06.097
AND A PLACE TO CRASH TONIGHT.
OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

01:06.097 --> 01:08.469
THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.471
HONEY,
I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.403
JULES COBB,
MOTHER TO THE WORLD.

01:12.403 --> 01:16.076
WELL, I LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE.
FEELING NEEDED IS LIKE MY CRACK.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.579
I CRAVE IT.
THAT'S A GREAT MESSAGE
FOR THE KIDS.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.081
BESIDES, HAVING LAURIE OVER
WILL BE FUN.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.713
IT'S LIKE HAVING
A SLUMBER PARTY.

01:22.713 --> 01:26.157
(cell phone chimes)
LAURIE, YOU'RE GETTING
ANOTHER TEXT.

01:26.157 --> 01:28.159
SHUT UP, NEZZIE.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.594
(sighs)

01:33.594 --> 01:35.426
I WAS THAT BAD?

01:35.426 --> 01:38.129
IF WE WERE IN PRISON,
I'D BE YOUR BITCH.
OH.

01:38.129 --> 01:39.430
(engine starts)

01:39.430 --> 01:43.474
BYE, AMBER!

01:43.474 --> 01:46.207
THAT'S NOT HER NAME.
OH, I WAS JUST GUESSING.

01:46.207 --> 01:51.282
HER NAME IS, UH, CANDEE.
NEAT! IS SHE A LAWYER
OR A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST?

01:51.282 --> 01:54.715
(laughs)
OH, GREAT. THE GIRL WITH
THREE TOE RINGS FINDS IT FUNNY.

01:54.715 --> 01:59.250
ONE OF THEM'S A TATTOO.
WOW, YOU SHUFFLED THAT POOR GIRL
OUT EARLY THIS MORNING.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.852
DID YOU EVEN FEED HER?
I DON'T LIKE EATING
WITH PEOPLE.

02:01.852 --> 02:03.854
WHAT ABOUT WHAT SHE LIKES?
THUMPY MUSIC.

02:03.854 --> 02:05.556
WHAT ELSE?
SHINY THINGS.

02:05.556 --> 02:08.359
LITTLE MORE.
CARTOONS.

02:08.359 --> 02:10.901
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.
BEING A VEGAN,
EXCEPT FOR PIZZA.

02:10.901 --> 02:14.165
OH, PAPER BUDDY,
THERE'S NOT AN ENDLESS SUPPLY

02:14.165 --> 02:16.167
OF HOT, DUMB GIRLS
IN THIS LITTLE TOWN.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.469
YOU KEEP ACTING LIKE
A SELFISH TOOL,

02:18.469 --> 02:20.211
WORD'S GONNA SPREAD.

02:20.211 --> 02:23.474
YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF
LIVING ON PLANET NO-LOVE.

02:23.474 --> 02:26.347
(car doors open and shut)

02:26.347 --> 02:28.919
THAT MEANS THAT GIRLS WON'T WANT
TO SLEEP WITH YOU ANYMORE!

02:28.919 --> 02:32.152
GOT IT.
HE'S GOT IT.

02:37.288 --> 02:39.330
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

02:39.330 --> 02:42.233
I WAS JUST DREAMING
ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH YOU

02:42.233 --> 02:44.735
ON A BEACH AT SUNRISE.

02:44.735 --> 02:47.738
OH, THAT'S SWEET. HERE'S WHAT
I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.700
WE'RE NEVER HAVING SEX
AT SUNRISE.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.343
IT'S WAY TOO EARLY. HAVE YOU
EVER DONE IT AT THE BEACH?

02:52.343 --> 02:55.506
I MEAN, THERE IS SAND
EVERYWHERE--JUST EW! OOH.

02:55.506 --> 02:57.378
ALSO ONE WORD--BUGS.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.750
SO WHY DON'T YOU
MOVE ME FROM THE BEACH

02:59.750 --> 03:02.283
TO A NICE HOTEL?
THERE'S NO HOTEL.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.385
WHAT IS THIS,
LIKE A SIDE-OF-THE-ROAD

03:04.385 --> 03:06.887
KIND OF BEACH WHERE CARS
DRIVE BY AND HONK,

03:06.887 --> 03:08.889
AND I'M LIKE, WHOO!
YOU KNOW, LIKE, OW!

03:08.889 --> 03:11.392
I MEAN,
I'M NOT SOME WHORE, JOSH.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.394
I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.726
I THINK WE'RE JUST BOTH
REALLY SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED.

03:15.726 --> 03:19.300
THIS WHOLE WAITING FOR TEN DATES
RULE IS JUST REALLY ROUGH.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.801
YEAH.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.803
I KNOW I'M BEING RUDE,
BUT I'M STARVING.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.876
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA EAT THAT,
MAY I HAVE IT?
MY OMELET?

03:25.876 --> 03:27.538
NO.

03:27.538 --> 03:29.240
GOOD GOD, BARB!

03:31.282 --> 03:34.915
I'M HAPPY THIS IS
OUR SEVENTH DATE.

03:36.847 --> 03:39.450
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
THAT WE PLAYED TENNIS

03:39.450 --> 03:42.293
AND THEN WENT TO DINNER
AND SAW A MOVIE?
YEAH.

03:42.293 --> 03:44.295
THAT'S TWO LOCATIONS
AND A WARDROBE CHANGE.

03:44.295 --> 03:46.297
THAT'S GOTTA COUNT
FOR AT LEAST TWO DATES.

03:46.297 --> 03:48.799
SO THAT MEANS
THIS IS OUR NINTH DATE,

03:48.799 --> 03:51.432
AND TOMORROW'S OUR TENTH DATE,
AND WE CAN FINALLY--

03:51.432 --> 03:54.265
JOSH, JOSH. COME ON,
WE'RE BOTH ADULTS HERE.

03:54.265 --> 03:56.807
PLEASE, LET'S NOT MAKE
TOO BIG OF A DEAL OUT OF IT.

03:56.807 --> 03:58.409
LAURIE!

03:58.409 --> 04:00.010
LAURIE!

04:00.010 --> 04:02.473
LAURIE!

04:02.473 --> 04:04.345
LAURIE, IT'S TOMORROW!

04:04.345 --> 04:08.619
IT IS?!
YES! TOMORROW, JOSH AND I
FINALLY GET TO HAVE...

04:08.619 --> 04:11.322
HELLO, MR. AND MRS. DERSHON.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

04:11.322 --> 04:14.925
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
SOME LOVELY HOMES TODAY.

04:25.696 --> 04:28.669
OH, YOU WANT TO SEE
A COOL MAGIC TRICK?

04:28.669 --> 04:32.002
(crying)

04:32.002 --> 04:33.944
(stops crying)

04:33.944 --> 04:35.946
TA-DA.

04:35.946 --> 04:39.780
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
AND THIS WILL BE
MY LAST BITE OF FOOD TODAY

04:39.780 --> 04:42.353
SO THAT MY STOMACH LOOKS
SUPER FLAT TONIGHT.

04:42.353 --> 04:45.616
WHAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT?
MMM. I'M HOSTING A CONFERENCE
ON MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

04:45.616 --> 04:48.288
WOW, I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS A LITTLE MEAN.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.021
HERE, HONEY,
HAVE THE REST OF MY BAGEL.
OH.

04:51.021 --> 04:52.863
(imitating Hannibal Lecter)
HELLO, CLARICE.

04:52.863 --> 04:55.065
COME ON, TRAVIS.
WE GOTTA GO SEE YOUR DAD.

04:55.065 --> 04:57.698
HEY, I'LL TAKE HIM OVER.
I KNOW BOBBY
WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND,

04:57.698 --> 04:59.930
BUT ONCE JULES
DIVORCED HIM, THAT ENDED.

04:59.930 --> 05:02.733
YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO SEE HIM.
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, ELLIE.

05:02.733 --> 05:06.076
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU.
SAY GOOD-BYE TO MEAN MOMMY.

05:06.076 --> 05:07.738
MM-HMM.

05:07.738 --> 05:09.910
SO WHAT TIME IS YOUR GENTLEMAN
CALLER ARRIVING TONIGHT?

05:09.910 --> 05:12.983
I TOLD HIM TO SHOW UP
AT 8:00.
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME
TO PREPARE?

05:12.983 --> 05:15.516
IT'S 10:00 IN THE MORNING.
IS SHE SERIOUS?

05:15.516 --> 05:18.349
WE'RE 40, LAURIE.
FOR US, GETTING READY FOR SEX

05:18.349 --> 05:21.091
IS LIKE PREPPING
FOR A SPACE MISSION.
WELL, I ALREADY SCHEDULED
YOUR MANI-PEDI.

05:21.091 --> 05:23.754
NOW MY RUSSIAN EYEBROW LADY
WAS MURDERED--LONG STORY.

05:23.754 --> 05:27.358
SO I WAS THINKING YOU COULD
JUST HAVE THE SAME GIRL

05:27.358 --> 05:29.630
THAT DOES YOUR BIKINI WAX
DO YOUR BROWS.
YOU CAN'T USE THE SAME PERSON
FOR BOTH THINGS.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.562
ONE'S A GARDENER.
THE OTHER'S AN ARTIST.

05:31.562 --> 05:33.564
OH, IF I'M GONNA GET WAXED,

05:33.564 --> 05:36.437
I GOTTA TIDY THE DEN
BEFORE THE MAID COMES.
MM.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.039
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
OH, IT MEANS JULES IS SO CRAZY,
SHE HAS TO GIVE HERSELF A TRIM

05:39.039 --> 05:41.472
BEFORE SHE GETS WAXED
SO HER WAXER DOESN'T THINK

05:41.472 --> 05:43.444
SHE'S A CAVEWOMAN.
OH, I ALSO HAVE
TO BLOW OUT MY HAIR.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.446
I'VE GOTTA BUY CANDLES,
WASH MY SHEETS.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.618
I GOTTA DO A THOUSAND SIT-UPS
AND BUY A BRA

05:47.618 --> 05:49.720
THAT DOESN'T SQUEEZE
MY BACK SO TIGHT

05:49.720 --> 05:52.022
THAT I GET, YOU KNOW, BACK BOOB.
WOW, JULES, YOU'RE REALLY
GOING ALL-OUT FOR THIS GUY.

05:52.022 --> 05:54.955
WHY? YOU DON'T EVER TRY
TO MAKE IT SPECIAL?
I DON'T KNOW.
IF I REALLY LIKE A DUDE,

05:54.955 --> 05:58.459
I'LL STOP TEXTING
WHILE WE DO IT.
I WISH YOU WERE MY DAUGHTER.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.962
TRAVIS, DID YOU FINISH
YOUR COLLEGE ESSAY?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.994
(high-pitched voice)
YEAH. IT'S GREAT.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.996
YOU HAVE TO DO IT
THIS WEEKEND.

06:05.996 --> 06:08.038
(normal voice)
HOW DID SHE KNOW?

06:08.038 --> 06:09.900
THE HIGH-PITCHED LIE--
EVERY MAN'S TELL.

06:09.900 --> 06:14.044
NO, IT'S NOT.
REALLY? HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A DIRTY DREAM ABOUT ME, TRAVIS?

06:14.044 --> 06:17.678
(high-pitched voice)
YOU? SICK! (clears throat)

06:17.678 --> 06:20.010
(normal voice)
MOM, MAKE LAURIE STOP.

06:20.010 --> 06:23.884
COME ON. LET'S GO SEE
YOUR DAD'S NEW PLACE.
NEW PLACE? WHERE DID HE MOVE?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.516
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

06:25.516 --> 06:28.659
THE OCEAN JUST
MAKES YOU FEEL ALIVE.
(seagulls calling)

06:28.659 --> 06:31.462
IT MIGHT BE NICER IF THE BOAT
WERE ACTUALLY IN THE WATER.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.067
YOU'RE RUININ' IT.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.930
PEEKABOO! THANKS FOR LETTING ME
STAY FOR BREAKFAST.

06:39.930 --> 06:43.033
ISN'T THIS FUN?
IT'S SO FUN.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.835
OH, YOU ARE SO NICE.

06:44.835 --> 06:46.637
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

06:46.637 --> 06:49.079
YEAH, RIGHT. I MEAN, IF I TOLD
DIEDRE, SHE'D BE ALL OVER YOU.

06:49.079 --> 06:51.982
THIS ONE TIME ON A BOOZE CRUISE,
SHE WAS ALL,

06:51.982 --> 06:54.114
"YOUR BOYFRIEND IS TASTY,"
AND I WAS ALL...

06:54.114 --> 06:56.587
EXCUSE ME FOR ONE SECOND.

07:00.791 --> 07:04.124
OH, MY GOD!

07:08.699 --> 07:11.502
SO... BOOZE CRUISE.
RIGHT. SO SHE WAS ALL,

07:11.502 --> 07:14.104
"YOUR BOYFRIEND IS TASTY."

07:14.104 --> 07:16.106
OH!

07:16.106 --> 07:18.809
I'M HAVING A CRISIS.
IS THIS A REAL CRISIS-CRISIS,

07:18.809 --> 07:21.111
OR A "MY FEET LOOK LIKE
ELEPHANT FEET" TYPE CRISIS?

07:21.111 --> 07:23.113
'CAUSE I KNOW MINE DO.

07:23.113 --> 07:25.846
I'VE GOTTA TAKE A SHOWER
BEFORE MY MANI-PEDI!
I HATE MY BABY.

07:25.846 --> 07:29.480
OH, MY GOD!
(dog barking)

07:29.480 --> 07:33.053
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON ALL DAY.
WOW, HE SEEMS TENSE.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.626
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

07:35.626 --> 07:38.128
YOU KNOW HOW I TAKE A NAP
EVERY DAY FROM 10:00 TO 11:45?

07:38.128 --> 07:40.961
YOUR LIFE IS
BETTER THAN MINE.
I KNOW.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.963
ANYWAY, I JUST HAD
THIS DREAM THAT I LOOKED

07:42.963 --> 07:46.997
INTO STAN'S STROLLER, AND HE WAS
COMPLETELY MADE OF CHOCOLATE.

07:46.997 --> 07:48.468
AND...

07:48.468 --> 07:50.200
YOU ATE YOUR BABY?

07:50.200 --> 07:51.902
WE'RE JUST NOT CONNECTING.

07:51.902 --> 07:53.744
WE HAVE
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TASTES

07:53.744 --> 07:55.746
IN FOOD, MUSIC AND BOOKS.

07:55.746 --> 07:57.748
AND I JUST KNOW
WHEN HE GETS OLDER,

07:57.748 --> 07:59.880
HE'S GONNA DO SOMETHING
TO DRIVE ME CRAZY...

07:59.880 --> 08:02.252
(voice breaking)
LIKE MARRY A POOR PERSON.
DO YOU WANT TO GO GET STAN

08:02.252 --> 08:04.885
AND TAKE HIM TO AN ITALIAN ICE
PLACE SO YOU FEEL LIKE

08:04.885 --> 08:06.517
HE LOVES YOU AGAIN?
YEAH.

08:06.517 --> 08:10.090
I FOUND BARNACLES
AND A STARFISH IN THE CABIN,

08:10.090 --> 08:12.963
AND IT SMELLS REALLY WEIRD
DOWN THERE.

08:12.963 --> 08:14.965
YEAH, WELL,
THIS PARTICULAR VESSEL

08:14.965 --> 08:17.097
WAS UNDERWATER
QUITE SOME TIME.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.099
YEAH, I'M NOT SURE
"JEALOUS MUCH?"

08:19.099 --> 08:22.733
IS THE RIGHT NAME
FOR YOUR BOAT.
(man) ALL RIGHT!

08:22.733 --> 08:25.105
OOH, THIS IS A SWEET JAM.
TRAVIS, TAKE THE BASS, BUDDY.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.578
I'LL HIT THE SOLOS.

08:27.578 --> 08:29.680
(Edgar Winter & Rick Derringer)
в™Є ROCK AND ROLL HOOTCHIE KOO в™Є
в™Є ROCK AND ROLL HOOTCHIE KOO в™Є

08:29.680 --> 08:32.282
(falsetto voice)
в™Є ROCK AND ROLL HOOTCHIE KOO в™Є
в™Є ROCK AND ROLL HOOTCHIE KOO в™Є

08:32.282 --> 08:35.185
в™Є LAWDY, MAMA,

в™Є LAWDY, MAMA, LIGHT MY FUSE в™Є

08:35.185 --> 08:37.187
YEAH, WHAT'S UP, LANDLUBBERS?

08:37.187 --> 08:39.590
DID SOMEBODY SAY,
"KEEP ON ROCKIN'"?

08:39.590 --> 08:41.892
(whistles)

08:41.892 --> 08:43.994
SEE YOU IN HOMEROOM, TRAVIS.
(chuckling)

08:43.994 --> 08:45.626
I CAN'T WAIT, DOUG.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.998
HEY, DAD, DOES THIS THING
HAVE AN ANCHOR

08:47.998 --> 08:50.160
YOU COULD DRIVE
THROUGH MY SKULL?

08:50.160 --> 08:51.562
(laughs)

08:51.562 --> 08:53.934
NOBODY TELLS MY WIFE
I WAS HERE.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.066
OKAY, OKAY, MR. TORRES,

08:56.066 --> 08:59.610
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS THING?

08:59.610 --> 09:03.013
IT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN YOU SAID.
HA! "JEALOUS MUCH?"

09:03.013 --> 09:05.245
UH, YEAH!
(laughs)

09:05.245 --> 09:08.118
CLASSIC TUNE! TURN IT UP!

09:08.118 --> 09:09.820
OH!

в™Єв™Є

09:14.054 --> 09:16.987
OH, STANLEY.

09:16.987 --> 09:19.029
LOOK HOW MUCH HE LOVES ME.

09:19.029 --> 09:21.832
OH, YOU GOT SOMETHIN'
ON YOUR FACE THERE, BUDDY.
OH, MY GOD.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.594
LOOK HOW DISGUSTING
YOUR NAILS ARE.

09:23.594 --> 09:25.936
WERE YOU TRAPPED IN A WELL?
I MISSED MY APPOINTMENT,

09:25.936 --> 09:28.138
AND AS OF NOW I'VE MISSED
MY WAXING, TOO.

09:28.138 --> 09:31.772
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUSH JOSH OFF
TILL TOMORROW.
OH, NO.
BUT YOU WERE SO EXCITED.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.104
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I'VE GOT TWO HOURS,

09:34.104 --> 09:36.677
AND THAT'S BARELY ENOUGH TIME
TO MOISTURIZE.
I'LL MAKE NEW APPOINTMENTS.
GET GOING.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.609
REALLY?
GO!

09:38.609 --> 09:40.811
OH, GOD. OKAY. DO YOU THINK--
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING, I'M GOING!
GO, GO, GO!

09:40.811 --> 09:42.953
I'M NOT SURE I'M COMFORTABLE
DOING THE MANICURE

09:42.953 --> 09:46.116
WHILE SHE'S WAXING YOU.
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU
BEING COMFORTABLE, LISA.

09:46.116 --> 09:48.959
I'M ON A SEXUAL DEADLINE HERE.
AND, CAROL, PLEASE DO ME A SOLID

09:48.959 --> 09:52.122
AND BLOW ON THAT STICK.
THAT STUFF IS CRAZY HOT.
(blows)

09:52.122 --> 09:54.665
LISA, USE THE SAME RED
AS LAST TIME.

09:54.665 --> 09:57.297
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, PEOPLE.
MOVE IT, MOVE IT!
THIS WILL ONLY WORK
IF YOU STAY PERFECTLY STILL.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.130
NO PROBLEM.
(Slavic accent)
NO ONE HAS EVER DONE THIS.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.672
BRING IT. I'LL BE STILL.
(loud rip)

10:01.672 --> 10:03.133
WOW.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.906
(voice breaking) BUT THAT
REALLY IS BEAUTIFUL RED.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.838
(loud rip)
AAH!

10:07.838 --> 10:11.311
WHY THE HELL DID I PARK
SO FAR AWAY?

10:11.311 --> 10:14.114
(cell phone rings)
DAMN IT! HEY, KID!

10:14.114 --> 10:16.616
(ring)
GRAB MY PHONE
AND PUT IT NEXT TO MY EAR.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.119
(ring)
IT'S OKAY. I KNOW YOUR MOM.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.891
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, HURRY.

10:20.891 --> 10:22.122
(beep)
HELLO?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.954
I WENT SWIMMING AT DALE'S,

10:23.954 --> 10:26.126
AND NOW HE THINKS IT'S FUNNY
TO TAKE MY CLOTHES.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.928
Will you come get me?
DO YOU REALLY KNOW MY MOM?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.100
YES.
SHE'S A VERY CLOSE FRIEND.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.733
LAURIE, DALE LIVES,
LIKE, 30 MINUTES AWAY.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.735
THANKS TO THE WORLD'S
FIRST MANI-WAXY,

10:34.735 --> 10:38.839
I ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT
AT BEING READY TONIGHT.
I AM NAKED IN SOMEONE'S YARD!

10:38.839 --> 10:41.641
(man) HEY, BABY!
I HATE YOU, DALE!

10:41.641 --> 10:45.275
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
THANKS.
WHAT'S MY MOM'S NAME?

10:45.275 --> 10:47.277
BETTY. OH, I DON'T KNOW.

10:47.277 --> 10:50.851
JUST GRAB A DOLLAR
WHEN YOU PUT THE PHONE BACK.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.823
WAIT! THAT'S A 20!

10:52.823 --> 10:55.185
WHATEVER YOUR MOM'S NAME IS,
SHE DIDN'T RAISE YOU RIGHT!

10:55.185 --> 10:56.987
CHUMP.

10:56.987 --> 10:58.188
(groans)

10:58.188 --> 11:00.190
(Florence & the Machine)
в™Є YOU HIT ME ONCE в™Є

11:00.190 --> 11:02.833
в™Є I'LL HIT YOU BACK,
YOU GAVE A KICK, I GAVE A SLAP в™Є

11:02.833 --> 11:05.195
в™Є YOU SMASHED
A PLATE OVER MY HEAD в™Є

11:05.195 --> 11:08.298
в™Є AND I SET FIRE TO OUR BED в™Є
(spritzing)

11:08.298 --> 11:11.902
в™Є OH, OH в™Є

11:11.902 --> 11:13.774
в™Є MY BLACK EYE
CASTS NO SHADOW в™Є

11:13.774 --> 11:16.046
в™Є YOUR RED EYE SEES NO PAIN в™Є

11:16.046 --> 11:18.348
в™Є BLOOD STICKS,
SWEAT DRIPS в™Є

11:18.348 --> 11:19.710
OW!

11:19.710 --> 11:21.011
OW!

11:21.011 --> 11:23.053
в™Є A KICK IN THE TEETH
IS GOOD FOR SOME в™Є

11:23.053 --> 11:26.686
(spritzing)
в™Є A KISS WITH A FIST
IS BETTER THAN NONE в™Є

11:26.686 --> 11:29.189
в™Є WHOA в™Є

11:29.189 --> 11:32.692
в™Є A KISS WITH A FIST
IS BETTER THAN NONE в™Є
(exhaling quickly)

11:32.692 --> 11:34.124
(doorbell rings)

11:34.124 --> 11:36.897
COME ON UP!

11:36.897 --> 11:38.228
в™Є UPON THE FLOOR в™Є

11:38.228 --> 11:40.731
в™Є BLOOD STICKS,
SWEAT DRIPS в™Є

11:40.731 --> 11:42.702
в™Є BREAK THE LOCK
IF IT DON'T FIT в™Є

11:42.702 --> 11:45.175
(whimpers, falsetto voice)
HOT, HOT, HOT.

11:45.175 --> 11:47.878
(knock on door)
I'M IN HERE.

11:47.878 --> 11:49.709
YOUR DOOR'S LOCKED.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.711
(sighs) DAMN IT!

11:53.113 --> 11:55.115
OW!
(thud, bubbling)

11:55.115 --> 11:57.447
I'M FINE.
(lock clicks)

11:57.447 --> 11:59.820
JUST COUNT TO THREE
AND COME IN.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.192
OH! AH.

12:02.192 --> 12:08.098
в™Є TO OUR BED в™Є

12:08.098 --> 12:10.160
HEY, STRANGER.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.461
WOW.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.133
OH.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.235
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.207
I BANGED MY FOOT PRETTY BADLY
WHEN I FELL,

12:17.207 --> 12:21.111
BUT YOU CAN'T SEE THE BLOOD
THROUGH ALL THESE BUBBLES.
GOOD.

12:21.111 --> 12:23.343
SO YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

12:23.343 --> 12:27.017
I DID NOT REALIZE
HOW TALL YOU ARE.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.279
THIS SPIGOT'S
DIGGING INTO MY SPINE.

12:29.279 --> 12:31.251
OH.
UH-HUH.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.885
YOU LIKE IT?

12:34.885 --> 12:36.256
IT'S PRETTY SWEET.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.188
(singsong voice) BE SURE.

12:38.188 --> 12:39.389
I AM.

12:39.389 --> 12:44.094
(normal voice) OKAY.
TAG OFF. IT'S A KEEPER.

12:44.094 --> 12:47.297
LET THE TENTH DATE BEGIN.

12:47.297 --> 12:49.039
MMM.

12:49.039 --> 12:53.003
WOW. WASN'T THAT AMAZING?

12:53.003 --> 12:55.105
(high-pitched voice) YEAH.

12:55.105 --> 12:57.177
WAIT.
WAS THAT HIGH-PITCHED?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.449
(normal voice) WHAT?

12:59.449 --> 13:03.053
NOTHING. UM, ON A SCALE
FROM ONE TO TEN,

13:03.053 --> 13:05.856
WAS THAT A NINE?
(high-pitched voice)
DEFINITELY.

13:05.856 --> 13:07.257
WAS IT A SIX?

13:07.257 --> 13:09.259
WAY HIGHER.

13:09.259 --> 13:12.192
(whispers) SON OF A BITCH!

13:18.328 --> 13:20.330
(stammers)

13:24.334 --> 13:26.336
HE GAVE YOU A SIX?

13:26.336 --> 13:28.478
A SIX AT BEST.

13:33.984 --> 13:35.886
ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN?

13:35.886 --> 13:38.048
YES, ELLIE.
(cell phone chirps)

13:38.048 --> 13:40.220
OH, BOY. THAT'S JOSH AGAIN.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.123
HE KEEPS TEXTING ME
FROWNY FACES.
HONEY, IT WAS ONLY ONE NIGHT.

13:43.123 --> 13:46.126
YES, BUT WITH THE DECORATING
AND THE COUNTING DOWN

13:46.126 --> 13:48.298
OF THE DAYS
AND THE BUYING STOCKINGS,

13:48.298 --> 13:50.300
IT WAS LIKE A BAD CHRISTMAS.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.262
YOU WERE PROBABLY
JUST OFF YOUR GAME, JULES.

13:52.262 --> 13:55.065
IT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US.
NO, IT'S TRUE.
I'M NOT A GREAT KISSER.

13:55.065 --> 13:56.867
I GET ALL BITE-Y.

13:56.867 --> 13:59.539
IT CAN KILL THE MOOD
AND REALLY HURT PEOPLE.
EH.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.611
I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH MY HANDS.

14:01.611 --> 14:04.144
LAST NIGHT I CAUGHT MYSELF
TAPPING THE DRUMBEAT

14:04.144 --> 14:07.247
TO "WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE"
ON ANDY'S BUTT.
AND IF I DON'T HAVE IT,
I JUST WHIP OUT THE GIRLS.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.020
THEY'RE MY SAFETY NETS.
WELL, I DID FEEL A LITTLE OFF.

14:10.020 --> 14:14.154
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS ON TOP,
MY KNEE KEPT CLICKING.
UGH. WHENEVER I'M ON TOP,

14:14.154 --> 14:17.157
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.360
IT MUST LOOK TERRIFYING.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.564
(humming Billy Joel's
"We Didn't Start the Fire")

14:24.564 --> 14:27.267
WHY IS THAT SONG IN YOUR HEAD?
I DON'T KNOW.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.000
HEY, BOBBY,
YOU AND I GET ALONG SO WELL.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.302
MAYBE OUR SONS
SHOULD START HANGING OUT.

14:32.302 --> 14:35.175
I'M 16 YEARS OLDER
THAN YOUR SON, MR. TORRES.

14:35.175 --> 14:40.180
HEY, T-MAN,
WHY YOU LAYING DOWN?
BECAUSE, DAD, I DON'T
WANT ANYONE TO SEE ME.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.612
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU
DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND

14:42.612 --> 14:45.155
IS THAT WHEN YOU ADD TOGETHER
THE GOLF CART

14:45.155 --> 14:47.157
THAT YOU DRIVE AROUND TOWN,
THE SUPER FUN FACT

14:47.157 --> 14:49.389
THAT YOU MOW LAWNS AT MY SCHOOL,
AND YOUR BRAND-NEW LAND BOAT,

14:49.389 --> 14:52.162
WELL, I'D SAY
YOU EMBARRASS ME A LITTLE.

14:52.162 --> 14:56.896
AND BY "A LITTLE," I MEAN
MORE THAN ANY PERSON EVER!

14:56.896 --> 14:59.599
NOW I'M GONNA CRAWL DOWNSTAIRS
AND GRAB A HOT SODA.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.933
DO YOU WANT ONE? MR. TORRES?

15:08.578 --> 15:11.942
WHOA. BODY BLOW.

15:11.942 --> 15:14.284
I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.

15:14.284 --> 15:16.046
THANKS, MAN.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.991
HERE ARE YOUR DRINKS
AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING.

15:20.991 --> 15:24.224
WELL DONE. AND YOUR PIE
IS ON ITS WAY OUT.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.397
YOU KNOW IT SERVES EIGHT,
RIGHT?
I DON'T NEED THE ATTITUDE.

15:27.397 --> 15:30.460
OH, REALLY? BECAUSE THANKS TO
YOU, THAT RIDICULOUS GIRL CANDEE

15:30.460 --> 15:33.063
WON'T LEAVE MY HOUSE,
AND THAT'S CANDEE

15:33.063 --> 15:35.365
WITH TWO E's AND NO LAST NAME.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.937
(chuckles) NO LAST NAME.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.540
(chuckles) THAT DID CHEER ME UP
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.273
(cell phone rings, beep)
OH. HEY.

15:43.273 --> 15:45.545
HEY, TRAVIS IS
IN ONE OF HIS MOODS,

15:45.545 --> 15:48.318
AND, UH, YOU KNOW I'M NOT
VERY GOOD AT TALKING TO HIM.

15:48.318 --> 15:50.450
ALL RIGHT. I'LL HANDLE IT.
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.324
WAS I GOOD IN BED?
(chuckles) Hell, yeah, J-Bird.

15:54.324 --> 15:58.328
I MEAN, YOU REMEMBER THAT ONE
TIME ON THE BEACH IN KEY WEST?
YEAH, THAT WASN'T ME.

15:58.328 --> 16:02.192
(chuckles) WHAT ABOUT THE TIME
ON THAT PUTT-PUTT COURSE?
ALSO NOT ME.

16:02.192 --> 16:04.164
COME ON, BOBBY. I NEED THIS!

16:04.164 --> 16:05.735
I GOT IT.

16:05.735 --> 16:09.499
THE BEST TIME EVER
WAS WHEN WE MADE TRAVIS.

16:09.499 --> 16:13.003
YEAH. AND WHEN WAS THAT?

16:13.003 --> 16:14.674
DAMN IT!

16:14.674 --> 16:16.676
OHH.
(beep)

16:16.676 --> 16:19.349
ALL RIGHT,
SO I'M HORRIBLE IN BED.

16:19.349 --> 16:20.680
NO.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S OKAY.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.682
BECAUSE NOW IF I SLEEP
WITH SOMEONE,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.684
AND THEY CHOOSE TO STAY WITH ME,

16:24.684 --> 16:27.617
I'LL KNOW THAT
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE SEX.

16:27.617 --> 16:31.161
IT'S BECAUSE THEY LIKE ME...
MM.

16:31.161 --> 16:33.363
FOR ME.

16:33.363 --> 16:35.595
WHERE IS THAT DAMN PIE?!

16:35.595 --> 16:37.767
NO LAST NAME!

16:37.767 --> 16:39.299
(sighs)

16:39.299 --> 16:42.572
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
STUPID BOBBY NEEDS MY HELP.

16:42.572 --> 16:45.275
OH. ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LET'S GO.

16:45.275 --> 16:48.038
WHAT? WHERE?
YEAH.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.680
WE LIVE, LIKE,
TWO MINUTES FROM THE BEACH.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.682
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE?

16:52.682 --> 16:55.345
NOBODY HAS TIME
TO GO TO THE BEACH.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.217
I COME HERE EVERY AFTERNOON
WHEN I TELL YOU THAT

16:57.217 --> 17:00.350
I'M OUT SEEING IF OUR
REAL ESTATE SIGNS ARE STILL UP.
OH, GOOD.

17:00.350 --> 17:04.754
I TAKE MY AFTERNOON NAPS HERE.
OH, MY GOD. YOU SLEEP,
LIKE, 21 HOURS A DAY.

17:04.754 --> 17:07.257
YEAH, BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO TAKE
CARE OF MYSELF, AND YOU DON'T.

17:07.257 --> 17:11.131
I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
NO. YESTERDAY WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR DAY,

17:11.131 --> 17:13.303
AND YOU SPENT
THE ENTIRE TIME HELPING ME

17:13.303 --> 17:15.435
AND GIANT SAFETY NETS OVER HERE.
OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.267
I MAY NEED A RIDE
BACK TO DALE'S LATER.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.769
WE MADE UP 'CAUSE HE GAVE ME
MY CLOTHES BACK AND BOUGHT ME

17:19.769 --> 17:24.344
THIS ANKLE BRACELET.
HE'S SO FUNNY SOMETIMES.
NO, HE'S REALLY NOT.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.416
AND SO WHAT IF I GET OFF
ON HELPING PEOPLE?

17:26.416 --> 17:29.149
I MEAN, EVERYBODY HAS THEIR
THING THEY DO THAT MAKES THEM

17:29.149 --> 17:31.251
FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THEMSELVES...

17:31.251 --> 17:34.224
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY
IMPRESSED WITH WHAT YOU SEE.

17:34.224 --> 17:38.228
THAT, CAROL,
IS TOTAL REJUVENATION SURGERY.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.690
UP HERE, I'M 48.

17:40.690 --> 17:44.394
BELOW THE BELT, I'M 19.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.796
NOW LET'S DETAIL
THIS FERRARI.

17:46.796 --> 17:48.438
WOW.

17:48.438 --> 17:51.471
YEAH. WOW.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.443
(Jules) AND SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST DOOMED

17:53.443 --> 17:55.145
TO HATE THEMSELVES.

17:55.145 --> 17:57.147
WHY DO I KEEP DOING THIS?

18:00.410 --> 18:02.382
OH, YEAH. HMM.

18:02.382 --> 18:05.255
ME, I BUY ITALIAN ICES
FOR MY FRIEND'S BABY

18:05.255 --> 18:07.257
AND PICK UP MY OTHER FRIEND

18:07.257 --> 18:09.419
FROM HER RECENTLY PAROLED
LOSER BOYFRIENDS.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.421
UH, DID YOU NOT SEE
THE ANKLE BRACELET?

18:11.421 --> 18:13.693
YEAH. IT'S HORRIBLE.
(chuckles)

18:13.693 --> 18:16.526
JULES,
YOU SPENT THE LAST 20 YEARS

18:16.526 --> 18:19.329
PUTTING OTHER PEOPLE
AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.831
IT'S OKAY TO BE SELFISH
ONCE IN A WHILE.

18:21.831 --> 18:24.674
(cell phone rings)

18:24.674 --> 18:26.436
(beep)
HELLO?

18:26.436 --> 18:28.308
WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED?

18:28.308 --> 18:31.311
I'M AT YOUR PLACE. I WAS
KIND OF HOPING YOU'D BE HOME.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.482
UH...
(beep)

18:32.482 --> 18:34.484
OH, HOLD ON.
I HAVE ANOTHER CALL.

18:34.484 --> 18:35.885
(beep)
HELLO?

18:35.885 --> 18:39.349
STILL WAITING ON THE J-BIRD.
YOU SAID YOU'D COME

18:39.349 --> 18:42.252
help out with Travis.
(lowered voice) WHO IS IT?

18:42.252 --> 18:44.554
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
(beep)

18:44.554 --> 18:47.827
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.300
HEY.

18:51.861 --> 18:55.535
OH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MOM.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.368
I HOPE I DIDN'T MAKE ANY
MISTAKES LAST NIGHT. I'M JUST--

18:58.368 --> 19:00.440
OKAY, JOSH, HERE'S THE DEAL.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.442
YOU CAN COME UPSTAIRS
IF YOU WANT TO,

19:02.442 --> 19:05.215
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A SHOWER.
I'M NOT PUTTING MY HAIR DOWN.

19:05.215 --> 19:08.278
I'M NOT TAKING MY SWEATSHIRT
OFF, AND WHEN I ASK YOU TO MOVE

19:08.278 --> 19:10.680
TO THE LEFT, I'M TALKING
ABOUT MY LEFT, NOT YOUR LEFT.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.183
SO ARE YOU IN, OR ARE YOU OUT?
I'M TOTALLY IN.

19:13.183 --> 19:15.485
THERE'S ALSO GONNA BE A PART
THAT I NEED TO CONCENTRATE,

19:15.485 --> 19:17.487
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BE REALLY QUIET.

19:17.487 --> 19:20.430
I MIGHT EVEN ASK YOU NOT TO TAKE
A BREATH FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

19:20.430 --> 19:24.594
HEY, LOOK, I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT DOING THE PARENT TALK

19:24.594 --> 19:26.796
ISN'T EXACTLY
MY STRONG SUIT.

19:26.796 --> 19:28.398
NO ARGUMENT.

19:28.398 --> 19:31.371
OH, HELL, I'M JUST GONNA
DIVE RIGHT IN. (clears throat)

19:31.371 --> 19:34.674
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE EMBARRASSED
BY YOUR OLD MAN.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.508
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

19:38.508 --> 19:40.380
TOUGH NUGGETS, LITTLE DUDE!

19:40.380 --> 19:43.883
I THINK
IT BUILDS CHARACTER.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.256
AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY
WITH ME EVERY WEEKEND

19:46.256 --> 19:48.318
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,

19:48.318 --> 19:51.321
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

19:51.321 --> 19:53.763
OH, AND A QUICK TIP--
THE KIDS WHO DON'T CARE

19:53.763 --> 19:56.866
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK
ALWAYS GET THE MOST TAIL.

19:58.528 --> 20:01.631
YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:01.631 --> 20:03.733
NAILED IT!

20:06.636 --> 20:08.978
(exhales deeply)

20:08.978 --> 20:11.341
JULES, THAT WAS--

20:11.341 --> 20:14.314
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
IT'S STILL QUIET TIME.
(whispers) SORRY.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.987
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY.

20:17.987 --> 20:21.321
(normal voice)
THAT WAS AMAZING.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.723
AND YOU KNOW
A LOT OF CURSE WORDS.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.496
I'M SORRY IF I MADE IT
ALL ABOUT ME.

20:26.496 --> 20:29.929
I JUST FELT LIKE BEING
A LITTLE SELFISH.
OH, THAT'S COOL.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.861
IS IT COOL, JOSH? IS IT?

20:31.861 --> 20:34.264
WHY DON'T YOU GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE

20:34.264 --> 20:36.966
AND LET ME GET SOME SLEEP?
I'M JUST KIDDING.

20:36.966 --> 20:39.269
I WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD PULL THAT OFF.
AND YOU TOTALLY CAN.

20:39.269 --> 20:41.811
YES! AHH.

20:41.811 --> 20:44.344
HMM.
HEY, JULES, I WAS THINKING--

20:44.344 --> 20:46.616
SHH, SHH, SHH.
QUIET TIME AGAIN.

20:46.616 --> 20:48.818
MMM.

20:54.524 --> 20:56.486
(horn honks)

20:56.486 --> 20:57.857
HI.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.789
HI, MOM.

20:59.789 --> 21:01.491
MMM.

21:01.491 --> 21:02.932
BYE, MOM.

21:02.932 --> 21:05.795
LOVE YOU, DAD.

21:05.795 --> 21:09.038
OH, MY GOD. DID HE JUST SAY,
"I LOVE YOU"?

21:09.038 --> 21:11.541
(front door opens and closes)
I KNOW. HOW GAY IS THAT?

21:11.541 --> 21:13.543
BUT, JULES,
I REALLY GOTTA THANK YOU

21:13.543 --> 21:16.646
FOR LETTING ME HANDLE THIS ONE.
IT WAS REALLY GOOD FOR ME.

21:16.646 --> 21:19.449
AND AS A THANK YOU, OUR TOP FOUR
EXPERIENCES, IN ORDER--

21:19.449 --> 21:21.681
THAT ONE TIME IN THE HAMMOCK
AT YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.714
THAT ONE TIME IN THE STABLES.

21:24.714 --> 21:27.417
THAT ONE TIME
WHEN WE WENT CAMPING,

21:27.417 --> 21:30.920
AND THAT ONE TIME IN THE THEATER
DURING "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN."
OH, BOBBY!

21:30.920 --> 21:34.694
RIGHT?
THREE OUT OF THE FOUR
OF THOSE WERE US.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.295
NICE!
