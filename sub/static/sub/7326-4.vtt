17:55.505 --> 17:59.479
OH, WHAT, TO BE--IT'S--
I-I'M INCAPABLE OF EMPATHY

17:59.479 --> 18:03.283
BECAUSE I GO TO CHURCH?
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.355
I CAN EMPATHIZE
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS,

18:05.355 --> 18:07.817
ESPECIALLY WITH A CHEATER.

18:07.817 --> 18:10.160
YOU'RE RIGHT.
(clears throat)

18:10.160 --> 18:11.361
I'M SORRY.
(bottle clinks,
champagne pouring)

18:11.361 --> 18:13.123
THANK YOU.

18:13.123 --> 18:15.425
I'M SORRY FOR
CALLING YOU A CHEATER.

18:15.425 --> 18:18.228
I AM, THOUGH.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.703
I KNOW.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.706
(sighs)
SHE STARED AT ME, TOO.

18:26.706 --> 18:30.310
BUT THE WAY SHE STARED...

18:30.310 --> 18:34.584
FELT... REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

18:34.584 --> 18:37.487
YOU KNOW?

18:39.789 --> 18:43.393
ACTUALLY, I DO.

18:43.393 --> 18:45.325
(Emma) AND THEN...

18:45.325 --> 18:46.756
HE CHAINSAWED HIS LEG OFF.

18:46.756 --> 18:49.359
BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO
THE STRANGEST THING I'VE SEEN.

18:49.359 --> 18:51.130
THOUGH, HONESTLY,
I'M NOT SURE THAT STORY

18:51.130 --> 18:53.303
IS APPROPRIATE.
(chuckles)

18:53.303 --> 18:54.464
(clears throat)

18:54.464 --> 18:57.637
GENTLEMEN, THAT STORY'S
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.470
OKAY, I LOOK FORWARD
TO IT.

19:00.470 --> 19:01.671
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.
OH.

19:01.671 --> 19:03.913
CHATTING UP OUR DONORS,
STEALING MY STORIES.

19:03.913 --> 19:05.615
YOU'RE A THIEF.
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME?

19:05.615 --> 19:07.617
MM-HMM. WHO ARE YOU?

19:07.617 --> 19:09.619
DR. EMMA MARLING,

19:09.619 --> 19:12.582
MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE,
SEATTLE PRES.

19:12.582 --> 19:14.754
AFTER THAT STORM,
WE'VE BEEN HURTING, TOO...

19:14.754 --> 19:16.486
BADLY.

19:16.486 --> 19:19.689
I'VE BEEN PUSHING OUR BOARD TO
THROW A FUND-RAISER FOR WEEKS,

19:19.689 --> 19:22.362
AND I CAN'T GET ANY TRACTION.
SO HERE I AM...

19:22.362 --> 19:24.664
BORROWING YOURS.
I'M NOT A THIEF.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.367
YOU STOLE MY STORY.
IT'S A GOOD STORY.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.169
I DON'T GET THIS.
YOU ARE HERE TO GET DONATIONS,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.502
AND YOU SPEND ALL THIS TIME
TALKING TO ME.

19:32.502 --> 19:35.405
(indistinct conversations)

19:35.405 --> 19:36.806
YOU-YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT?

19:36.806 --> 19:39.178
(mouths words)
(chuckles) I MEAN,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.481
LOOK AT YOU.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.214
(cheers and applause)

19:44.214 --> 19:47.517
(laughter)

19:47.517 --> 19:50.790
(indistinct conversations)

19:50.790 --> 19:52.362
(mouths words)

19:56.326 --> 19:57.427
IMPRESSIVE PARTY.

19:57.427 --> 19:59.329
ANOTHER WHISKEY SODA.

19:59.329 --> 20:00.600
THAT'S YOUR FIFTH ONE.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.503
WHO ARE YOU, MY MOM?
I'M NOT DRINKING.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.704
GOTTA STAY SHARP.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.437
THIS IS FOR THE C.F.O.
OF A.E.C. INTERACTIVE.

20:07.437 --> 20:08.838
GOT HIM ON THE ROPES.

20:08.838 --> 20:10.340
EVERY DRINK HE KNOCKS BACK

20:10.340 --> 20:11.981
IS ANOTHER "ZERO"
ADDED TO THE CHECK

20:11.981 --> 20:13.343
I COLLECT AT THE END
OF THE NIGHT.

20:13.343 --> 20:14.644
THAT SOUNDS WRONG.

20:14.644 --> 20:16.486
RIGHT AND WRONG
DON'T LIVE HERE, SON.

20:16.486 --> 20:18.318
THIS IS THE WILD WEST.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.919
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!

20:19.919 --> 20:21.321
IT'S LIKE WHEN
WE WERE INTERNS--

20:21.321 --> 20:24.494
STEALING SURGERIES,
PLAYING DIRTY.

20:24.494 --> 20:26.456
I DON'T REALLY GET
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

20:26.456 --> 20:28.798
DOES THIS LOOK STUPID?

20:28.798 --> 20:32.001
THE KID SPIT UP ON MY DRESS,
AND IN MY DRESS...

20:32.001 --> 20:33.563
ALL OVER, REALLY.

20:33.563 --> 20:36.466
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MER.
YOU'RE MAKING IT SO EASY.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.270
EVERY NIGHT, HARVEY WOULD
WHISPER, "I LOVE YOU"

20:40.270 --> 20:42.972
INTO MY EAR JUST AS
I WAS FALLING ASLEEP.

20:42.972 --> 20:46.245
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE,
AND STILL,

20:46.245 --> 20:49.018
EVERY NIGHT, I FEEL LIKE
I CAN HEAR HIS VOICE.

20:49.018 --> 20:51.751
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE THAT--
LIKE SHE'S STILL WITH YOU?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.553
(microphone taps)
(Jackson, amplified voice)
ALL RIGHT.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.385
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE?

20:55.385 --> 20:57.557
OH, SPEECH! SPEECH!
EVERYBODY, HUSH UP!

20:57.557 --> 21:00.830
OH, SORRY. (chuckles)
HE'S GONNA TALK NOW.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.593
THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

21:03.593 --> 21:05.635
I AM DR. JACKSON AVERY.

21:05.635 --> 21:08.998
AND ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD
OF GREY SLOAN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,

21:08.998 --> 21:11.571
I JUST WANT TO SAY, "WELCOME."

21:11.571 --> 21:14.344
(cheering)
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

21:14.344 --> 21:15.875
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:15.875 --> 21:19.379
NOW OVER THE PAST YEAR,
WE HAVE SEEN MANY CHANGES,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.681
FROM A CHANGE IN NAME
TO A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP...

21:21.681 --> 21:23.713
AND IT HAS ALL BEEN
A CHALLENGE.

21:23.713 --> 21:25.785
BUT IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE
THAT WE'VE ALL

21:25.785 --> 21:27.387
BEEN MORE THAN HAPPY TO ACCEPT.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.520
(cheers and applause)

21:30.520 --> 21:31.921
THANK YOU.

21:31.921 --> 21:33.723
AS SURGEONS--
(boom)

21:33.723 --> 21:35.495
(guests gasp)
WAIT!

21:40.299 --> 21:41.431
(thuds)
(guests gasp)

21:41.431 --> 21:44.303
WAS THAT PART OF IT?
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.306
(guests murmuring)

21:49.939 --> 21:51.541
OH, NO, NO, NO!
YOU NEED TO STOP.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.983
YOU COULD HAVE
INTERNAL INJURIES OR BREAKS.

21:53.983 --> 21:56.516
UM...
I THINK I'M OKAY. SEE?

21:56.516 --> 21:58.448
I'M OKAY. I'M FINE.

21:58.448 --> 21:59.689
(cracks)
OW!

21:59.689 --> 22:01.391
(gasping and shouting)

22:01.391 --> 22:05.395
SO, YEAH, I'D SAY
THERE'S A BREAK.

22:05.395 --> 22:06.526
(sobs)

22:11.100 --> 22:12.502
WHAT'S THE UPDATE
ON THOSE PARAMEDICS, AVERY?
SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

22:12.502 --> 22:15.104
NO PULSE. OKAY. HOLD STILL.
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

22:15.104 --> 22:17.867
READY ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO...
(crying)

22:17.867 --> 22:19.338
THREE!
(cracks)

22:19.338 --> 22:20.670
(screams)

22:20.670 --> 22:22.071
(lowered voice)
DO YOU THINK HE'S WATCHING?
WHO?

22:22.071 --> 22:24.874
RICHIE RICH. 'CAUSE WE LOOK
FREAKING AMAZING RIGHT NOW.

22:24.874 --> 22:28.017
CRISTINA, GROSS!
(cell phone ringing)

22:28.017 --> 22:30.049
Edwards, someone better
be dying.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.781
I'M REALLY HOPING
TO AVOID THAT, DR. YANG.

22:31.781 --> 22:34.454
ROSS IS DOING
A PERICARDIAL WINDOW IN THE E.R.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.055
Okay, when he aspirates
the fluid,

22:36.055 --> 22:38.728
GET HIM TO THE O.R.
I'M ON MY WAY.
(beeps)

22:38.728 --> 22:41.731
GO. WE GOT THIS.
THIS WAY, GUYS.

22:41.731 --> 22:43.663
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
OH, BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.536
SOME JUNKIE WITH ENDOCARDITIS
IS TAMPONADING.
WHICH JUNKIE?

22:46.536 --> 22:47.997
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE?

22:47.997 --> 22:49.969
IT'S ALL ABOUT FORGIVENESS.
MM-HMM.

22:49.969 --> 22:53.443
AND THAT'S...
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

22:53.443 --> 22:57.106
YOU--HE... HE SEES ME
FOR WHO I AM.

22:57.106 --> 23:01.911
AND HE ACCEPTS ME
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE.

23:04.814 --> 23:07.587
BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.760
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
MATTHEW OR JESUS?
(door opens)

23:10.760 --> 23:12.722
DR. ROBBINS?
YES!

23:12.722 --> 23:14.694
YOU PAGED ME...
HI.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.997
TO A CLOSET?
I NEED YOU TO RUN ACROSS
TO THE GALA

23:17.997 --> 23:20.600
AND GRAB
A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE BECAUSE

23:20.600 --> 23:24.774
WE'RE LOW.
WE ARE LOW.

23:24.774 --> 23:25.905
YOU WANT ME TO STEAL BOOZE

23:25.905 --> 23:27.106
FROM THE PARTY
I WASN'T INVITED TO?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.579
AND SNACKS!
(chuckles)

23:29.579 --> 23:32.942
SCREW THIS DAY.
UH, THANK YOU, MURPHY.

23:32.942 --> 23:34.584
THANK YOU.
(door closes)

23:34.584 --> 23:37.146
(exhales)

23:37.146 --> 23:39.489
YOU THINK CALLIE'S
EVER GONNA FORGIVE ME?

23:39.489 --> 23:40.850
PROBABLY NOT.

23:40.850 --> 23:45.054
SHE'S TELLING EVERYBODY
AT THE GALA THAT YOU'RE DEAD.

23:45.054 --> 23:46.856
(man) YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ABOUT READY TO ROLL.

23:46.856 --> 23:48.698
(ambulance doors open)

23:48.698 --> 23:49.899
(man shouts indistinctly)

23:49.899 --> 23:51.030
(Jackson)
HEY, I'M COMING, TOO.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.062
HOW ARE WE DOING
ON OUR FUND-RAISING GOAL?

23:53.062 --> 23:54.163
OH, WE'RE NOT EVEN
HALFWAY THERE.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.836
WELL, THEN YOU'VE GOT
PLENTY TO DO HERE.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.968
(man) WE'RE TAKING THEM
OUT OF DOWNTOWN.

23:58.968 --> 24:00.970
(ambulance doors close,
horn blares)

24:00.970 --> 24:02.942
(tires screech)
(Meredith) I'M WORRIED ABOUT
INTERNAL INJURIES.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.614
MAKE SURE THEY RUSH HER
TO C.T.
ALL RIGHT.

24:04.614 --> 24:05.745
YOU'RE NOT COMING?

24:05.745 --> 24:08.878
WE'RE ON MATERNITY LEAVE.
WE HAVE A DEAL.

24:08.878 --> 24:13.853
MER, LET'S GO.
WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.455
(rattling and clacking)

24:19.529 --> 24:20.990
(muffled voice) LET ME GO!

24:20.990 --> 24:22.191
LET GO! (grunts)
DR. WEBBER--PLEASE!

24:22.191 --> 24:24.193
DR. WEBBER--
OH! I-I CAN TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

24:24.193 --> 24:25.995
I CAN TAKE IT.
LET GO!

24:25.995 --> 24:28.167
(panting)
(whooshing)

24:28.167 --> 24:29.999
(raspy voice)
I DON'T WANT THIS.

24:29.999 --> 24:32.872
(whooshing stops)
(coughing)

24:32.872 --> 24:36.976
THERE'S A MAN DOWN THE HALL.
HE IS ORNERY.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.909
HE'S A JACKASS.
HE'S DYING.

24:39.909 --> 24:42.211
AND HE WON'T STOP FIGHTING,

24:42.211 --> 24:45.054
EVEN THOUGH THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR HIM.

24:45.054 --> 24:46.516
AND THEN I'VE GOT YOU.
(continues coughing)

24:46.516 --> 24:51.190
YOU'VE GOT A MILLION OPTIONS,
AND YOU REFUSE TO TRY.

24:51.190 --> 24:55.765
YOU HAVE ATELECTASIS.

24:55.765 --> 24:59.999
YOU ARE IN DANGER FOR
PNEUMOTHORAX PNEUMONIA, R.D.S.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.872
AND MEREDITH GREY IS READY
TO LET YOU SLIP INTO A COMA.

25:02.872 --> 25:06.175
BUT I AM NOT!
YOU BREATHE IN THROUGH THIS,

25:06.175 --> 25:08.638
YOUR LUNGS GET STRONGER,
YOU GET BETTER.

25:08.638 --> 25:10.039
IT'S DAMN SIMPLE MATH.
(clatters)

25:10.039 --> 25:11.581
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

25:20.049 --> 25:22.021
(clatters)

25:22.021 --> 25:24.954
(sighs)
(clatters and thuds)

25:28.898 --> 25:31.931
THIS IS DUMB.
PUT THIS ON. PUT--
NO! NO!

25:31.931 --> 25:32.932
JUST--RICHARD!
NO.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.533
RICHARD!
(grunts)

25:34.533 --> 25:37.767
(chair clatters)
(strained voice)
GET THE HELL...

25:37.767 --> 25:39.138
OUT!

25:39.138 --> 25:41.741
(sighs)

25:55.024 --> 25:57.857
LET'S TAKE HIM OFF BYPASS
AND SEE HOW WE DID.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.630
(suction gurgling,
monitor beeping steadily)

26:00.630 --> 26:02.832
EVERYTHING OKAY, DR. YANG?

26:02.832 --> 26:05.094
PERICARDIAL WINDOW IS A PRETTY
RISKY MOVE FOR AN INTERN.

26:05.094 --> 26:07.266
I... I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.268
THE FLUID WAS TOO THICK
FOR A PERICARDIOCENTESIS.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.840
YOU HAD A CHOICE.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.071
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED SOMEONE
THE MINUTE HE TAMPONADED,

26:12.071 --> 26:14.103
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

26:14.103 --> 26:17.847
YOU BASICALLY GOT TO DO
A SURGERY IN THE E.R.

26:17.847 --> 26:19.108
AND NOW YOU'RE UP HERE
WITH ME,

26:19.108 --> 26:22.311
WHILE EDWARDS
IS DOWN IN THE PIT.

26:22.311 --> 26:25.054
YOU'RE A SHARK.
I'M NOT! I SWEAR.

26:25.054 --> 26:27.356
ROSS, IT'S A GOOD THING.

26:27.356 --> 26:29.659
ALL GREAT SURGEONS
ARE SHARKS.

26:29.659 --> 26:33.693
YOU SEE WHAT YOU WANT AND DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET IT.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.825
LIKE ME.
AND NEVER APOLOGIZE.

26:35.825 --> 26:39.629
SHARKS DON'T APOLOGIZE.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

26:39.629 --> 26:40.900
MONITOR.
(man) HERE YOU GO.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.301
WHERE'S THAT COMING FROM?

26:42.301 --> 26:45.004
IT'S COMING FROM INSIDE.
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.937
ONE--WE CAN PUT HIM BACK
ON BYPASS, UNDO ALL OUR WORK,

26:47.937 --> 26:51.110
AND FIND THE SOURCE, OR...

26:51.110 --> 26:52.812
TWO--I TAKE A GUESS,
THROW IN A U-STITCH

26:52.812 --> 26:55.645
AND HOPE I DON'T SHRED
THE HEART IN THE PROCESS.

26:55.645 --> 26:57.787
DR. ROSS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:57.787 --> 27:01.320
SHARKS DON'T SWIM BACKWARD.
ONLY FORWARD... OR THEY DIE.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.922
♪♪♪

27:02.922 --> 27:04.924
OPTION 2 IT IS.
4-0 PROLENE.

27:04.924 --> 27:05.995
HERE YOU GO.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.972
(Cristina) THERE IT IS.

27:22.972 --> 27:25.344
(Shane)
WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?

27:25.344 --> 27:28.217
IF IT WORKED, NOTHING.
IF IT DIDN'T...

27:28.217 --> 27:29.849
LOTS.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.380
(monitor beeping steadily)

27:36.325 --> 27:37.827
(steady beeping continues)

27:40.329 --> 27:42.161
(squishing)

27:44.433 --> 27:48.067
THAT'LL DO, SHARKY.
THAT'LL DO.

27:52.702 --> 27:54.974
(indistinct conversations)

27:54.974 --> 27:57.406
MURPHY, THOSE AREN'T FOR YOU.
YEAH, I KNOW.

28:00.349 --> 28:02.381
HAVE YOU SEEN MY WIFE?

28:02.381 --> 28:05.214
UH, SHE, UH, HOPPED ON A RIG
WITH THE PARAMEDICS.

28:05.214 --> 28:07.887
(under breath) DAMN IT.
HEY, SHEPHERD?

28:07.887 --> 28:10.089
SHEPHERD! WILSON,
WHERE THE HELL IS KAREV?

28:10.089 --> 28:11.290
QUESTION OF THE NIGHT!

28:11.290 --> 28:12.822
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD BE
AT WORK RIGHT NOW.

28:12.822 --> 28:14.423
YOU KNOW, STEPHANIE DOESN'T
REALIZE HOW LUCKY SHE IS.

28:14.423 --> 28:16.896
SHE SHOULD BE THANKING YOU
INSTEAD OF BEING PISSED AT YOU.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.798
YEAH. WAIT, WHAT?
(sighs)

28:18.798 --> 28:20.870
SHE WANTED TO COME TONIGHT?
SHE BOUGHT A DRESS.

28:20.870 --> 28:23.232
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
OF COURSE NOT.

28:23.232 --> 28:25.034
IF SHE HAD TO SAY SOMETHING,
IT WOULDN'T MEAN AS MUCH

28:25.034 --> 28:27.376
AS IF YOU'D HAD THE IDEA
ON YOUR OWN.
OH, MY GOD.

28:27.376 --> 28:29.939
MY HEAD HURTS SO MUCH.
(sighs)
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

28:29.939 --> 28:32.111
THE PARTY DIED THE MINUTE
THE AERIALIST FELL ON BIG BIRD.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.143
PEOPLE SEE A WOMAN'S TIBIA
IMPALE HER OWN FOOT,

28:34.143 --> 28:35.384
IT'S HARD TO STEER
THE CONVERSATION

28:35.384 --> 28:37.086
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
THEY'RE GONNA BE FINE.

28:37.086 --> 28:40.049
ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A HOSPITAL
RIGHT DOWN...

28:40.049 --> 28:41.350
DOWN THE STREET.

28:41.350 --> 28:42.952
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

28:42.952 --> 28:45.124
FOLKS, WAIT A SECOND.

28:46.355 --> 28:49.058
(telephone ringing)

28:49.058 --> 28:51.901
DR. BAILEY?

28:51.901 --> 28:53.232
(sighs)

28:53.232 --> 28:55.204
DR. BAILEY, PLEASE?

28:57.366 --> 28:59.208
(woman over P.A.)
DR. STUART TO I.C.U.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.509
DR. STUART TO I.C.U.

29:00.509 --> 29:02.872
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

29:02.872 --> 29:05.014
I HAVEN'T PLAYED CHESS
IN A YEAR.

29:05.014 --> 29:08.377
(sighs) I CAN'T KEEP
HAVING THIS FIGHT, GENE.

29:08.377 --> 29:10.319
NO, I KNOW. I JUST...

29:10.319 --> 29:15.184
THE GUYS AT THE PARK
STOPPED LETTING ME PLAY.

29:15.184 --> 29:16.926
(chuckles)

29:16.926 --> 29:19.388
'CAUSE OF THE THINGS
I SAY.

29:19.388 --> 29:22.131
I'M NOT TRYING
TO OFFEND YOU.

29:23.863 --> 29:27.066
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.338
I SAID A COUPLE OF THOSE THINGS
ON PURPOSE.

29:29.338 --> 29:33.472
SO... I'M SORRY.

29:33.472 --> 29:36.545
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY
THE GAME, BUT PLEASE...

29:40.309 --> 29:43.352
I'M SCARED.

29:43.352 --> 29:45.384
(voice breaking)
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.

29:47.817 --> 29:49.318
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

29:53.963 --> 29:56.966
(suction gurgling,
monitor beeping steadily)

29:59.328 --> 30:01.070
(pounds window)

30:01.070 --> 30:03.002
What are you doing?

30:03.002 --> 30:05.134
Repairing a gastric rupture.
It's fun.

30:05.134 --> 30:06.876
You can't just decide
to operate.

30:06.876 --> 30:09.808
DEREK, YOU'RE BETTER AT CHARMING
THE DONORS THAN I AM.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.340
I ADMIT IT.
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.083
We had a deal.
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO COME AND JOIN ME.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.885
Come get a little blood
on your hands.

30:15.885 --> 30:17.346
I'LL EVEN LET YOU
HOLD A RETRACTOR.

30:17.346 --> 30:20.419
(suction continues gurgling)
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA CHANGE.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.292
(monitor beeping steadily)

30:23.292 --> 30:25.895
(both laughing)

30:25.895 --> 30:26.996
(bottle thuds)

30:26.996 --> 30:30.860
OH, THIS IS
REALLY, REALLY FUN,

30:30.860 --> 30:32.001
AND I NEEDED FUN.

30:32.001 --> 30:33.602
ME, TOO.

30:33.602 --> 30:35.034
YEAH.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.336
(both continue laughing)

30:41.370 --> 30:43.042
OH.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.244
CAN I TRY ON YOUR LEG?

30:48.317 --> 30:50.619
(laughs)

30:50.619 --> 30:54.283
(laughs)

30:54.283 --> 30:57.887
YOU SAID WHAT?

30:57.887 --> 31:01.260
I WAS CORNERED BY
THE WIDOW AMOS...
(drill whirring)

31:01.260 --> 31:03.592
WHO WAS, YOU KNOW,
ACTUALLY A WIDOW.

31:03.592 --> 31:07.566
HER STORY WAS SO SAD, AND SHE
TOOK OUT HER CHECKBOOK, AND I--

31:07.566 --> 31:10.099
UGH, I'M SO GROSS.

31:10.099 --> 31:11.540
YEAH. (chuckles)

31:11.540 --> 31:14.243
(whirring)
I SORT OF GET IT, THOUGH.

31:14.243 --> 31:16.405
REALLY?
MM. THIS STUFF--

31:16.405 --> 31:18.377
IT'S NOT EASY.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.410
AND CRISTINA--SHE KEEPS
PUSHING ME TO DATE.

31:21.410 --> 31:24.113
GOD, I CAN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT.
(whirring stops)

31:24.113 --> 31:27.386
YEAH. YOU REALLY CAN'T KEEP
TELLING PEOPLE THAT SHE'S DEAD.

31:27.386 --> 31:31.090
I KNOW.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.421
(indistinct conversations)

31:32.421 --> 31:33.923
(switch clicks, static warbles)

31:33.923 --> 31:35.524
(Jackson)
DOCTORS, WE HAVE VISITORS.

31:35.524 --> 31:37.266
(people murmuring)

31:37.266 --> 31:40.169
WHAT IS HE UP TO?
I DON'T KNOW.

31:40.169 --> 31:43.302
OKAY, NOW IF YOU'LL NOTICE
THE PINS THAT DR. TORRES

31:43.302 --> 31:46.475
IS DRILLING INTO PLACE--
THAT IS THE EXTERNAL FIXATION

31:46.475 --> 31:49.178
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
ARE--ARE WE ALLOWED TO BE HERE?

31:49.178 --> 31:51.240
YES, I SPOKE
WITH IRINA'S HUSBAND.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.912
HE SAID THAT IF THERE'S
ONE THING THAT SHE BELIEVES IN,

31:53.912 --> 31:56.115
IT'S THAT THE SHOW
MUST GO ON.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.287
NOW WE SHOWED YOU GUYS
A CIRCUS TONIGHT.

31:58.287 --> 32:01.350
BUT THIS--
THIS IS THE REAL SHOW.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.122
THIS IS WHAT WE DO HERE.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.324
WE ARE GONNA GET THIS WOMAN
BACK ON HER FEET.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.695
AND THEN BEFORE YOU LEAVE
THIS EVENING,

32:06.695 --> 32:09.258
I WOULD ASK
THAT YOU PLEASE CONSIDER

32:09.258 --> 32:12.261
HELPING US GET BACK
ON OURS.

32:12.261 --> 32:14.003
(drill resumes whirring)

32:14.003 --> 32:17.206
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

32:17.206 --> 32:20.209
(people murmuring)

32:22.541 --> 32:25.444
(door opens)

32:25.444 --> 32:26.675
WOW!

32:26.675 --> 32:29.979
I USUALLY HAVE REALLY GOOD
RADAR FOR THIS CRAP.

32:29.979 --> 32:32.681
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

32:32.681 --> 32:34.283
OH, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

32:34.283 --> 32:36.655
DON'T FREAKING JOKE LIKE THAT.
I DON'T DO THAT.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.427
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
A FREAKIN' BLOOD DRAW.

32:38.427 --> 32:41.360
WHY?
I THINK MY DAD'S
IN THE HOSPITAL.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.292
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS.

32:43.292 --> 32:46.565
I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T--

32:46.565 --> 32:48.567
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN 20 YEARS.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.370
AND THIS GUY--
SOME OLD JUNKIE--

32:51.370 --> 32:54.973
CRASHED A CAR, HAS NO I.D.,
HE'S RAGGED, WRECKED.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.476
BUT HIS VOICE IN THE E.R.--
GUY CALLED ME SINATRA.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.009
IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY POURED
ICE WATER DOWN MY NECK.

33:00.009 --> 33:01.110
THAT FEELING
HASN'T GONE AWAY.

33:01.110 --> 33:03.712
SO THIS IS A PATERNITY TEST?
I DON'T KNOW.

33:03.712 --> 33:05.114
NO.

33:05.114 --> 33:06.385
I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE
THE REST OF MY LIFE

33:06.385 --> 33:09.288
AND NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.220
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE HIM.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.661
IF YOU TAKE THE TEST,
THEN YOU'LL KNOW FOR SURE.

33:12.661 --> 33:15.294
IF IT ISN'T HIM,
THEN THAT FEELING WILL GO AWAY.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.426
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

33:17.426 --> 33:18.727
MM-HMM. YEAH.

33:18.727 --> 33:20.399
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
PRETTY SMART.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.271
YOU'D KNOW THAT
IF YOU TRIED TALKING TO ME

33:22.271 --> 33:24.733
INSTEAD OF DITCHING ME
AT FANCY PARTIES.

33:24.733 --> 33:26.675
I'M SORRY.
YEAH.

33:26.675 --> 33:28.207
OKAY.

33:32.541 --> 33:34.543
THAT SURGERY WAS INCREDIBLE.

33:34.543 --> 33:37.516
I HAVEN'T FELT
THIS RELAXED IN MONTHS.
(grunts) ME EITHER.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.320
(sighs)

33:41.320 --> 33:43.252
WHAT?
REMINISCING.

33:43.252 --> 33:44.523
ABOUT?

33:44.523 --> 33:47.696
YOU, ME, AN EXAM ROOM,
AND YOUR PANTIES

33:47.696 --> 33:49.628
PINNED TO A BULLETIN BOARD.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.430
OH, THE PROM. (laughs)

33:51.430 --> 33:53.732
EXCEPT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
BLOOD ON YOUR SUIT,

33:53.732 --> 33:56.405
AND I WASN'T WEARING
A SWEATSHIRT.
I THINK IT'S SEXY.

33:57.406 --> 33:59.438
NOW YOU'RE DOING
THE SPARKLY EYE THING.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.541
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
MM-HMM.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.313
IS IT WORKING?

34:04.313 --> 34:06.245
(laughs)

34:06.245 --> 34:07.746
(grunts)
(screams and laughs)

34:07.746 --> 34:11.620
(wheels clacking,
monitor beeping steadily)

34:11.620 --> 34:14.183
HEY, HEY! WHAT--
WHAT'S THIS?

34:14.183 --> 34:15.224
YOU'RE GETTING A ROOMMATE.

34:15.224 --> 34:17.356
GENE, RICHARD.
RICHARD, GENE.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.587
CALM DOWN, DICK.

34:18.587 --> 34:20.329
THE WAY YOU LOOK,
CAN'T IMAGINE

34:20.329 --> 34:22.091
YOU'RE GONNA BE AROUND
MUCH LONGER ANYWAY.

FOR FACILITIES

34:24.733 --> 34:27.566

WITH END OF LIFE CARE.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.398

ARE IN THE SAME BOAT,
