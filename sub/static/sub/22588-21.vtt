<i> A beautiful Wednesday</i>
<i> afternoon in Gotham city.</i>

00:15.177 --> 00:17.977
<i> Matinee day at this theatre.</i>

00:17.979 --> 00:21.880
<i> In a moment, the play goers</i>
<i> will be coming out</i>

00:21.882 --> 00:24.482
<i> for a refreshing orange drink.</i>

00:24.484 --> 00:25.916
<i> But watch closely.</i>

00:25.918 --> 00:30.921
<i> There may be a drama</i>
<i> that's not on the program.</i>

00:35.358 --> 00:40.095
So, what's superior to this sort
of thing, one usually sees?

00:40.097 --> 00:40.895
Oh, yes, infinitely.

00:40.897 --> 00:44.698
And the leading man,
my dear, Mrs. Van Climber.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.132
His tremendous power.

00:46.134 --> 00:49.168
Absolutely inspired,
my dear Penguin.

00:49.170 --> 00:52.137
It's a penetrating documentary
in our time.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.906
It's a mirror
of a cliched minds

00:54.908 --> 00:58.843
of our sadly weakened
moral fiber.

00:58.845 --> 00:59.977
Wouldn't you say so?

01:02.747 --> 01:03.679
Oh!

01:03.681 --> 01:06.615
Hands up everybody
and you won't get hurt.

01:06.617 --> 01:07.482
I ain't kidding.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.083
Do as he says, Penguin.

01:09.085 --> 01:10.717
He's a desperate man.

01:10.719 --> 01:12.018
Ah.

01:13.854 --> 01:14.486
You.

01:14.488 --> 01:16.821
'Unhook that ruby pendant.'

01:18.790 --> 01:20.457
Throw it here.

01:20.791 --> 01:24.093
- Outrageous monster.
- Shh. He'll hear you.

01:24.095 --> 01:26.929
Back away everybody! Back away!

01:26.931 --> 01:30.632
You, knave thief, surrender!

01:30.634 --> 01:32.000
Wise guy, huh?

01:32.002 --> 01:33.634
Take this.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.341
Jumpin' jeepers!

01:41.343 --> 01:43.276
A bulletproof umbrella!

Ms. Starr.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.599
- Uh.
- May I?

02:11.601 --> 02:13.267
Thank you.

02:15.103 --> 02:15.469
Yeah.

02:15.471 --> 02:20.273
Oh! How can I <i> ever,</i>
<i> ever</i> thank you?

02:20.275 --> 02:21.907
Yeah.

02:24.643 --> 02:26.110
Oh! What?

02:26.112 --> 02:27.811
The Penguin prevented a crime?

02:27.813 --> 02:30.547
That waddling
pompous master of foul play?

02:30.549 --> 02:31.414
It's true, commissioner.

02:31.416 --> 02:34.316
And who do you think,
the necklace belongs to?

02:34.318 --> 02:36.384
Ms. Sophia Starr.

02:36.386 --> 02:37.518
Sophia Starr?

02:37.720 --> 02:39.753
Beauteous queen
of Gotham City society?

02:39.755 --> 02:43.456
That's her. They left the
theatre hand in hand.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.090
Ominous, most ominous.

02:45.192 --> 02:46.891
What do you think it means,
commissioner?

02:46.893 --> 02:50.027
Since it involves The Penguin,
there is only one man

02:50.029 --> 02:51.595
who can answer that question.

02:51.597 --> 02:52.929
And answer it in time.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.065
The Caped Crusader.

03:04.541 --> 03:08.242
Alright, commissioner,
I'll fetch him for you.

03:10.611 --> 03:14.080
<i> And in Wayne Manor, where young</i>
<i> Dick Grayson</i>

03:14.082 --> 03:17.950
<i> practices his putting under the</i>
<i> watchful eye of his guardian</i>

03:17.952 --> 03:22.254
<i> millionaire Bruce Wayne and his</i>
<i> doting Aunt Harriet.</i>

03:22.256 --> 03:24.222
Ow! Missed that one.

03:24.224 --> 03:26.724
Precision, Dick.
Precision.

03:26.726 --> 03:30.761
The key to...success
in life and as well in sports.

03:30.763 --> 03:34.698
And excuse me, sir, but there's
a telephone call for you.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.299
A certain Mr. Rime.

03:36.301 --> 03:37.300
- Rime?
- Yes, sir.

03:37.302 --> 03:41.203
Mr. K Rime,
if you understand me.

03:41.205 --> 03:41.836
Of course.

03:41.838 --> 03:45.072
Mr. K Rime with the red hot line
of investments

03:45.074 --> 03:46.206
for the Wayne foundation.

03:46.208 --> 03:47.006
Precisely, sir.

03:47.008 --> 03:49.174
Dick, it's about time you
started learning something

03:49.176 --> 03:51.643
'about the elements
of investment.'

03:51.645 --> 03:53.111
We may be a while,
Aunt Harriet.

03:53.113 --> 03:58.216
Mr. K Rime might want us to
visit him at the stock exchange.

03:58.218 --> 04:01.352
So long, Aunt Harriet,
See you later.

04:01.686 --> 04:02.719
Mercy me.

04:02.721 --> 04:07.824
What an unfortunate name for an
investment councilor.

04:07.826 --> 04:10.226
K Rime.

04:10.228 --> 04:12.094
Sounds like crime!

04:12.096 --> 04:13.628
Isn't that funny, Alfred?

04:13.630 --> 04:17.697
I'd be very careful
about him if I were Bruce.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.666
Indeed, madam.

04:23.102 --> 04:23.935
Yes, commissioner.

04:23.937 --> 04:26.804
A strange and troubling
turn of events, Batman.

04:26.806 --> 04:29.807
You have a competitor
in crime fighting.

04:29.875 --> 04:31.408
The Penguin!

04:32.344 --> 04:34.310
We're on our way.

04:34.844 --> 04:35.844
The Penguin.

04:35.846 --> 04:36.611
Holy nick of time.

04:36.613 --> 04:39.614
Lucky for us we just finished
installing the bulletproof

04:39.616 --> 04:40.781
windshield in the Batmobile.

04:40.783 --> 04:43.450
Not so lucky for The Penguin.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.720
To the Bat-poles.

We got the picture.

06:16.530 --> 06:19.998
I'll call you back
if Batman has any ideas.

06:20.966 --> 06:22.032
What do you think, Batman?

06:22.034 --> 06:24.000
Has The Penguin
really gone straight?

06:24.002 --> 06:25.534
It's a tough one.

06:25.536 --> 06:26.902
When that bird turn snow white

06:26.904 --> 06:28.870
it could be merely
a tricky white wash job.

06:28.872 --> 06:32.974
Right. But still, we've got
to think of his records

06:32.976 --> 06:34.175
since he last left prison.

06:34.177 --> 06:36.177
Clean as a whistle, it seems.

06:36.179 --> 06:38.045
Accepted in the best circles.

06:38.047 --> 06:40.280
Not even a ticket
for jaywalking.

06:40.282 --> 06:42.515
Could it be that,
he is reformed?

06:42.517 --> 06:43.883
Or only pretending to reform.

06:43.885 --> 06:47.253
Stalking his next victim under
the false colors

06:47.255 --> 06:48.220
of a crime fighter.

06:48.222 --> 06:49.821
How the heck do we find out?

06:49.823 --> 06:51.956
- I have an idea.
- What, Batman?

06:51.958 --> 06:55.125
Say that caper at the theatre
was a Penguin's employee.

06:55.127 --> 06:58.728
And that crook he caught must've
been an accomplice, right?

06:58.730 --> 06:59.628
On the nose.

06:59.630 --> 07:00.862
Call the commissioner.

07:00.864 --> 07:02.997
Have him give that crook
a grilling.

07:02.999 --> 07:07.034
We'll be there
in time for the kill.

07:08.270 --> 07:12.572
Alright, I'll ask
you one more time.

07:13.807 --> 07:16.041
How long have you
known The Penguin?

07:16.043 --> 07:18.843
- Who?
- Quit lying, you cheap hoodlum.

07:18.845 --> 07:20.644
He paid you
to pull that job.

07:20.646 --> 07:21.978
Told you to keep
your mouth shut.

07:21.980 --> 07:24.013
Promised to cut you
on the big job later.

07:24.015 --> 07:27.049
You guys must read too many
comic books or something.

07:27.051 --> 07:28.917
Hold it, Chief O'Hara,
no rough stuff.

07:28.919 --> 07:31.152
It's our duty to
abide by the rules.

07:31.154 --> 07:33.687
Now, this lying is useless.

07:33.689 --> 07:34.754
Besides.

07:34.756 --> 07:35.955
We have evidence.

07:35.957 --> 07:39.591
- Evidence?
- The bulletproof umbrella.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.859
Why would The Penguin have
carried a bulletproof umbrella

07:41.861 --> 07:45.195
to a matinee unless he expected
a machine gun attack.

07:45.197 --> 07:46.829
Who knows? Ask him.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.369
A hard baked cookie, this one.

07:53.371 --> 07:56.271
Covered with armor plate icing

07:56.273 --> 07:59.173
Let's give him a turn, shall we?

08:07.015 --> 08:07.447
'Hey.'

08:07.449 --> 08:11.851
'What's the matter, sonny?
Scared of the dark?'

08:15.021 --> 08:15.787
Ah!

08:15.789 --> 08:18.456
Help, there's bats
loose in here.

08:28.699 --> 08:29.799
Holy knock-out drops.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.234
The miserable weakling,
faded, dead away.

08:32.236 --> 08:34.236
Looks like, you over-did it,
Batman.

08:34.238 --> 08:35.937
Only one thing to do now.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.171
Find Penguin himself.

08:37.173 --> 08:38.205
Put the blocks to him.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.140
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, lieutenant.

08:40.142 --> 08:43.208
We have a report from the tail
we put on The Penguin.

08:43.211 --> 08:46.078
He just entered the Gotham City
Millionaire's club.

08:46.080 --> 08:46.845
Holy Jackpot.

08:46.847 --> 08:49.881
That bird of prey,
loose among the golden geese.

08:49.883 --> 08:51.315
There's only one
way to find out.

08:51.317 --> 08:53.216
Call the parking lot.
Have 'em clear

08:53.218 --> 08:55.184
all the exits
for the Batmobile.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.655
<i> Meanwhile, in the steam room</i>
<i> of the super exclusive</i>

09:01.657 --> 09:03.723
<i> Gotham Millionaire's club.</i>

09:03.725 --> 09:06.625
<i> A strange disquieting scene.</i>

09:06.627 --> 09:08.660
Leave that man alone
you criminals.

09:08.662 --> 09:12.030
- Take him out of here.
- Look out. Watch out!

09:12.032 --> 09:13.464
- Quick.
- More steam.

09:13.466 --> 09:15.199
Roger.

09:20.238 --> 09:22.339
'That's got it.'

09:23.541 --> 09:25.708
A snatch in the fog, eh?

09:31.347 --> 09:34.482
Alas, you sad,
dim-witted ruffian!

09:34.484 --> 09:37.084
- The smoke screen.
- It's gone.

09:37.086 --> 09:38.151
Jesus.

09:38.153 --> 09:39.485
Oh, thank you, sir.

09:39.487 --> 09:40.552
They tried to kidnap me.

09:40.554 --> 09:42.654
It's alright, Reggie, my boy.

09:42.656 --> 09:43.988
You are safe now.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.990
You're with The Penguin.

09:46.391 --> 09:47.424
Put up your flippers, Penguin.

09:47.426 --> 09:50.026
We caught you with
your feathers down.

09:50.028 --> 09:50.559
Kidnapping.

09:50.561 --> 09:52.994
One false move
and you get the batarang.

09:52.996 --> 09:57.031
Hello, my esteemed colleagues
in crime fighting.

09:57.033 --> 10:00.134
The droll deceivers,
the dynamic duo.

10:00.136 --> 10:02.136
Batman, listen.
You've got it all wrong.

10:02.138 --> 10:05.205
The Penguin saved me
from being kidnapped.

10:05.207 --> 10:06.272
Saved you?

10:06.274 --> 10:07.473
I swear to you, old boy.

10:07.475 --> 10:09.374
Some villains were
trying to abduct me

10:09.376 --> 10:11.409
under the cover
of a steam screen.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.510
And heaven knows how he did it.

10:12.512 --> 10:16.280
This delightful bird-like chaps
suddenly dispelled the steam

10:16.282 --> 10:18.482
and the criminals
took to their heels.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.217
Elementary, my dear, Reggie.

10:20.219 --> 10:24.321
My ubiquitous umbrella
was fortunately loaded

10:24.323 --> 10:25.422
with colored dry ice.

10:25.424 --> 10:30.527
When I discharged the jet, the
vapor was instantly condensed.

10:34.732 --> 10:36.799
Something fishy here.

10:36.801 --> 10:37.833
There's sure is.

10:38.035 --> 10:40.935
He must have known about
the supposed kidnapping.

10:40.937 --> 10:43.570
Otherwise, why would he be
carrying an umbrella

10:43.572 --> 10:44.537
loaded with dry ice?

10:44.539 --> 10:47.840
The reason
is the season, Batman.

10:47.842 --> 10:48.207
What?

10:48.209 --> 10:50.842
This prematurely hot weather
annoys me.

10:50.844 --> 10:55.112
Being a Penguin is kind of
a bird, I hate hot weather.

10:55.114 --> 10:56.913
So what could be
more natural

10:56.915 --> 11:00.383
than I should carry an umbrella
loaded with dry ice?

11:00.385 --> 11:01.083
Oh, yeah.

11:01.085 --> 11:05.020
If you hate the heat so much,
what you doing in a steam room?

11:05.022 --> 11:06.955
I ask you, is that
an ethical question?

11:06.957 --> 11:11.859
Between crime fighters,
competitors, you might say.

11:11.861 --> 11:15.329
You pompous,
taunting creature!

11:16.031 --> 11:18.398
Well, I'm sorry I must fly.
I'm very busy.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.134
I have little rendezvous
with Sophia Starr.

11:21.136 --> 11:22.935
We have some arrangements
to make.

11:22.937 --> 11:25.904
- Arrangements?
- For her jewels.

11:25.906 --> 11:28.940
I'm taking over
their protection.

11:28.942 --> 11:31.208
I'm gonna give you my card.

11:33.278 --> 11:34.110
<i> Adieu.</i>

11:34.112 --> 11:35.010
Come on, my dear boy.

11:35.012 --> 11:40.015
Well, you saved my life, if
there's anything I can do..

11:40.017 --> 11:45.286
Penguin Protective
Agency Incorporated.

11:45.553 --> 11:47.186
Holy leopard!

11:47.188 --> 11:50.022
What a change of spots.

11:55.330 --> 11:56.195
The Penguin.

11:56.197 --> 11:57.963
In business
as a private eye.

11:57.965 --> 12:00.065
Hiring him
to guard jewels is like..

12:00.067 --> 12:01.900
...trusting a lethal
lettuce to a rabbit.

12:01.902 --> 12:04.936
Let's race back
and give Ms. Starr a warning.

12:04.938 --> 12:05.903
Nuisance.

12:05.905 --> 12:07.037
She's smitten with him.

12:07.039 --> 12:08.238
She'd scoff at us.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.472
So what do we do?

12:09.474 --> 12:10.439
We can't protect her.

12:10.441 --> 12:14.609
We can save her jewels
at the same time set a trap.

12:14.611 --> 12:15.376
Great. How?

12:15.378 --> 12:18.312
We substitute fake jewels with
the real ones, Robin.

12:18.314 --> 12:23.050
Treat it in a reactor to leave
radioactive traces of the thief.

12:23.052 --> 12:23.617
Terrific!

12:23.619 --> 12:25.352
There's just one problem.

12:25.354 --> 12:26.219
'To make copies.'

12:26.221 --> 12:29.188
I dunno what the
real ones look like.

12:29.190 --> 12:29.588
Correct.

12:29.590 --> 12:32.557
Has to look at them.
That would tip Penguin off.

12:32.559 --> 12:34.926
Pickup the Bat-phone
and call Alfred.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.661
Tell him to wait for
us in the Bat-cave.

12:36.663 --> 12:41.465
Alfred is going to be our
secret undercover agent.

12:46.004 --> 12:46.770
What?

12:46.772 --> 12:49.405
Reggie Rich gave you
a check for $10,000

12:49.407 --> 12:50.205
and you tore it up?

12:50.207 --> 12:52.707
Indeed. And right
in front of his very eye.

12:52.709 --> 12:56.477
You know somethin', this plan of
being a straight guy must have

12:56.479 --> 12:57.778
unhinged Penguin's mind.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.246
No, you, butt-brain.

12:59.948 --> 13:02.481
What's 10,000,
when I aim at millions?

13:02.483 --> 13:06.585
Confidence. That's is what I'm
stealing from these dupes.

13:06.587 --> 13:08.853
Confidence
and pride in The Penguin.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.590
And they'll end up
handing me their treasure

13:12.592 --> 13:13.457
on a silver plate.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.592
- Yeah, but I wonder..
- You wonder, what?

13:15.594 --> 13:17.160
Don't get mad at me Penguin
but..

13:17.162 --> 13:20.129
I wonder what Batman and Robin's
gonna say about that.

13:20.131 --> 13:23.665
Piddling pair will be punctured!
Now and forever.

13:23.667 --> 13:24.632
Then, no offence, Penguin,

13:24.634 --> 13:26.433
but we heard you
sing that song before.

13:26.435 --> 13:30.136
We always end up singing
the anvil chorus in the pen.

13:30.138 --> 13:34.106
Not this time, you see. I have
planted a seed in their mind.

13:34.108 --> 13:36.842
I've planted
the erroneous idea

13:36.844 --> 13:42.080
that I'm going to steal
the jewels of Sophia Starr.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.681
You mean, you ain't?

13:43.683 --> 13:44.515
No! I'm not.

13:44.517 --> 13:48.886
I delight in the devious,
I obviate the obvious.

13:48.888 --> 13:51.455
They're misreading
my intentions.

13:51.457 --> 13:53.757
They're going to lay
a trap for me.

13:53.759 --> 13:56.126
A trap which when it springs..

13:56.795 --> 14:00.630
♪ And Batman and Robin will
never come back ♪

14:00.632 --> 14:02.198
♪ Batman and Robin will
never..♪♪

14:02.200 --> 14:06.001
Well, farewell,
my fine fostered fates.

14:06.003 --> 14:07.035
Your mind has tore.

14:07.037 --> 14:13.541
I'm going to see our shining
star, Sophia Starr.

14:15.711 --> 14:16.676
<i> What an counter-plot.</i>

14:16.678 --> 14:20.780
<i> Here's Alfred, carrying out</i>
<i> a vital but risky chore.</i>

14:20.782 --> 14:25.885
<i> In the guise of a man from</i>
<i> Floyds Insurance Limited.</i>

14:25.887 --> 14:26.585
Excellent!

14:26.587 --> 14:28.820
I think that just about does it,
Ms. Starr.

14:28.822 --> 14:31.622
You're sure, there's nothing
else you want?

14:31.624 --> 14:32.189
No, thank you.

14:32.191 --> 14:34.858
That would just
complete our records.

14:37.229 --> 14:38.962
Beg your pardon,
Pengy darling.

14:38.964 --> 14:40.596
What offends me
to the quick.

14:40.598 --> 14:44.533
An insurance company worrying
about the safety of your jewels

14:44.535 --> 14:46.535
while they are under my
guardianship.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.604
One can never be too secure,
can one, Mr. Penguin?

14:49.606 --> 14:53.841
With the world these days
so full of predators.

14:54.743 --> 14:58.611
<i> Great Scott, Alfred. Have you</i>
<i> forgotten? Batman told you</i>

14:58.613 --> 15:00.980
<i> to switch cigarette holders</i>
<i> with The Penguin.</i>

15:00.982 --> 15:05.050
<i> You're meant to palm off the</i>
<i> trick one with a tiny super</i>

15:05.052 --> 15:07.052
<i> powered transmitter inside.</i>

15:07.054 --> 15:09.020
<i> Quick! Before it's too late.</i>

15:09.022 --> 15:10.988
<i> Create that diversion.</i>

15:10.990 --> 15:12.889
Good day, Ms. Starr.

15:15.592 --> 15:16.658
'Great heavens!'

15:16.660 --> 15:20.595
The anti-theft system
built into my carrying case

15:20.597 --> 15:21.896
it went off accidently.

15:21.898 --> 15:25.266
Don't panic.
I can fix that.

15:27.836 --> 15:29.203
'There! Neutralized.'

15:29.205 --> 15:32.839
Buy my high powered
de-magnetizer coil.

15:32.841 --> 15:34.674
Oh, Pengy.

15:34.676 --> 15:35.875
'You're fantastic.'

15:35.877 --> 15:37.109
'No trouble at all.'

15:37.111 --> 15:41.113
'Where there's no end to your
resourcefulness.'

15:41.115 --> 15:43.215
'Thank you, my love, thank you.'

15:43.217 --> 15:46.785
- Oh, Pengy.
- Ha ha ha.

15:46.787 --> 15:49.888
Oh, look, the handle of your
umbrella.

15:49.890 --> 15:50.588
What?

15:50.590 --> 15:53.791
'Sound! My secret radio
detector.'

15:53.793 --> 15:58.929
Somebody has planted
an electronic bug in this room.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.833
Huh?

16:10.840 --> 16:12.307
Eh.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.647
Ah.

16:24.086 --> 16:27.921
So, you switched
cigarette holders, did ya?

16:29.223 --> 16:30.523
Ah.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.257
I think not.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.225
Out with you, criminal.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.793
Who are you working for?

16:37.095 --> 16:40.463
It can happen to the best of us,
Mr. Penguin.

16:40.465 --> 16:41.964
One moment everything
is going smoothly.

16:41.966 --> 16:47.503
And the next, fate pulls
the rug out from under us.

16:47.505 --> 16:50.672
- Ah! Pengy
- Good day, miss.

16:50.674 --> 16:52.240
Oh, Pengy, dear.

16:52.242 --> 16:55.109
Pengy, my poor darling.

16:55.111 --> 16:56.510
Who cares about him?

16:56.512 --> 16:58.011
Are you alright?

16:58.013 --> 16:59.112
Vengeance!

17:02.349 --> 17:04.883
Failure, sir.
Utter failure.

17:04.885 --> 17:06.483
That's not true, Alfred.

17:06.486 --> 17:07.017
Of course not.

17:07.019 --> 17:11.954
Important thing was to get this
picture of Sophia's jewels.

17:11.957 --> 17:13.021
You got it.

17:13.023 --> 17:13.722
Sure you did.

17:13.723 --> 17:16.023
And we already made
a complete set of fake copies.

17:16.026 --> 17:20.395
Thanks to you, we may be able
to avert a gigantic robbery.

17:20.396 --> 17:22.463
Robin, grab those fake jewels.

17:22.464 --> 17:25.933
We must strike before
The Penguin does.

17:25.935 --> 17:26.833
Let's go.

18:02.668 --> 18:04.135
We're sure taking a chance,
Batman.

18:04.137 --> 18:07.238
What's the matter?
Souls of your boots slippery?

18:07.240 --> 18:07.838
Heck no!

18:07.840 --> 18:10.941
I mean when we put the fake
jewels in Ms. Starr's safe.

18:10.943 --> 18:14.210
Take the real one's out.
We could be nailed as crooks.

18:14.212 --> 18:16.478
That's the chance
we have to take.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.112
In our well ordered society

18:18.114 --> 18:21.582
protection of private
property is essential.

18:21.584 --> 18:22.649
Yes, you're right, Batman.

18:22.651 --> 18:25.618
That's the keystone
of all law and order.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.252
Let's go, chum.

18:40.199 --> 18:43.267
The safe should
be behind that picture.

18:43.935 --> 18:45.835
Coast seems clear.

18:49.706 --> 18:52.874
Turn off the electric
iron looping on it.

18:52.876 --> 18:54.709
Neutralize the alarm.

18:54.711 --> 18:56.610
I'll listen to the tumblers.

18:56.612 --> 18:58.011
Roger.

19:12.559 --> 19:16.161
Perfect. Tumblers are
falling into place.

19:18.164 --> 19:19.264
Caught you, you thieves.

19:19.266 --> 19:21.566
One move and you're a dead duo.

19:21.568 --> 19:22.266
Holy. Bat-trap!

19:22.268 --> 19:24.268
Let's fight our way outta this.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.706
Ah!

19:29.708 --> 19:31.040
Whoa!

19:35.912 --> 19:37.212
Ah.

20:04.206 --> 20:05.238
They getting out the window.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.774
Let 'em go,
they won't get far.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.575
Pengy dear, you alright?

20:10.577 --> 20:12.610
Sophia, my dear,
you call the police.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.879
I'll call
the Gotham City Times.

20:21.751 --> 20:22.617
Shocking! shocking!

20:22.619 --> 20:25.019
How can a responsible
press print such an item?

20:25.021 --> 20:27.221
But you can't blame
the papers, commissioner.

20:27.223 --> 20:30.090
Things sure look dark for
Batman when the lights went on.

20:30.092 --> 20:35.962
Yes, but still how could a sane
person think Batman a criminal?

20:35.964 --> 20:38.764
How ungrateful the public is!

20:42.267 --> 20:46.303
Yes, put him on.
It's Penguin.

20:46.671 --> 20:47.971
Good morning, commissioner.

20:47.973 --> 20:51.341
Have you snared that
costumed crooks yet?

20:51.343 --> 20:53.376
They're still at large, Penguin.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.811
Well, that's very lax
of you, commissioner.

20:55.813 --> 20:58.880
I do hope that they
won't burst in tonight

20:58.882 --> 21:00.615
and terrorize our party.

21:00.617 --> 21:01.148
Your party?

21:01.150 --> 21:05.986
Yes. Anyway, you're invited.
Might come, if you like it.

21:05.988 --> 21:07.754
Some of my
influential friends

21:07.756 --> 21:11.090
are giving a gala benefit
for the P.P.A..

21:11.092 --> 21:14.726
That's the
Penguin's Protective Agency.

21:15.227 --> 21:20.798
Yes. We have taken over
the Gotham amusement pier.

21:21.065 --> 21:22.999
Should be amusing.

21:23.001 --> 21:27.370
You... you abominable avian!

21:37.913 --> 21:41.015
- Yes, Commissioner.
- Gotham amusement pier tonight.

21:41.017 --> 21:44.251
- Penguin is tossing a party.
- Interesting.

21:44.253 --> 21:45.919
You better not be there, Batman.

21:45.921 --> 21:49.289
If you are spotted,
I'll have to arrest you.

21:53.694 --> 21:56.362
It's our only hope, Robin.
We'll have to catch Penguin

21:56.364 --> 21:59.965
in something crooked that he
won't be able to press that

21:59.967 --> 22:01.333
warrant for our arrest.

22:01.335 --> 22:04.202
- Have an awful thought, Batman.
- What?

22:04.204 --> 22:08.873
What if Penguin really
has gone straight?

22:25.721 --> 22:28.089
- Right!
- What do you think, Batman?

22:28.091 --> 22:30.291
He's with Sophia Starr
and she's wearing

22:30.293 --> 22:31.258
those priceless diamonds.

22:31.260 --> 22:36.129
Yeah, I have a strange feeling,
It's time for the kill.

22:41.034 --> 22:44.068
Gee, that cement-filled umbrella
sure cooled them off.

22:44.070 --> 22:47.004
Well done, my finks,
well done.

22:47.006 --> 22:47.771
What now, Penguin?

22:47.773 --> 22:50.373
String them up here back
of the shooting gallery

22:50.375 --> 22:51.841
directly behind the cut-outs.

22:51.843 --> 22:54.210
- Right.
- Now, one small detail.

22:54.212 --> 22:58.447
Our umbrella pop guns,
take out the pellets.

22:58.449 --> 23:02.451
Introduce real bullets.
Ha ha ha.

23:07.991 --> 23:10.224
You, eh, challenge us, Penguin?

23:10.226 --> 23:11.425
I certainly do.

23:11.427 --> 23:14.127
Knowing you gentlemen
to be of sporting blood

23:14.129 --> 23:18.197
I know that you'll play this
exquisite of the game with me.

23:18.199 --> 23:22.334
If you'll burst those two red
balloons on the first round.

23:22.336 --> 23:27.972
I'll donate 1000 dollars to
your police benevolent fund.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.507
'That's too easy, Penguin.
Much too easy'

23:30.509 --> 23:32.075
'There must be a
catch towards somewhere.'

23:32.077 --> 23:36.279
'No, catch whatsoever. If you
shoot those two red balloons'

23:36.281 --> 23:40.149
you will be doing
Gotham City a gigantic favor.

23:40.151 --> 23:42.751
Doing the city a big favor?

23:42.753 --> 23:44.285
What the devil? Why not?

23:44.287 --> 23:48.922
- Give us the guns, Penguin.
- Give them the umbrella gun.

23:49.089 --> 23:55.094
<i> Batman and Robin,</i>
<i> a swinging pair of dead ducks!</i>

23:55.096 --> 23:57.896
<i> What on earth can save them?</i>

23:57.898 --> 24:01.432
<i> Don't shoot, Commissioner!</i>
<i> Don't shoot!</i>

24:01.434 --> 24:03.467
All set, gentlemen?

24:03.469 --> 24:04.334
We're set.

24:04.336 --> 24:07.137
Now, on my instructions.

24:07.139 --> 24:09.139
Ready?

24:11.542 --> 24:12.775
Aim.

24:14.077 --> 24:16.178
<i> Good grief! Good night!</i>

24:16.180 --> 24:17.846
<i> Double funeral tomorrow.</i>

24:18.248 --> 24:22.250
<i> Same bat-time,</i>
<i> same bat-channel.</i>

24:22.384 --> 24:25.886
<i> Can you see any way out?</i>
