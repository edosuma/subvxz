WEBVTT

00:07.317 --> 00:09.075
Spring dance
only comes once a year

00:09.076 --> 00:11.086
and there's only one thing
stopping Gabriel Barnett

00:11.087 --> 00:12.589
from asking me to the dance

00:13.291 --> 00:15.490
and that's Gabriel Barnett
asking me to the dance.

00:16.534 --> 00:17.729
There he is.

00:21.008 --> 00:22.218
I'm going in.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:57.265 --> 00:58.428
That's it.

00:59.027 --> 01:00.777
I'm through playing hard-to-get.

01:03.236 --> 01:05.031
He didn't even
look at you.

01:05.594 --> 01:08.224
Eddie, what does a girl have to
do to get a guy to notice her?

01:08.225 --> 01:10.717
What is under my nail?

01:12.054 --> 01:13.889
I swear I don't
remember eating that.

01:21.857 --> 01:24.291
Stinky Sturkey.

01:25.197 --> 01:27.106
Oh... hi, guys.

01:27.107 --> 01:28.991
Hey.

01:29.870 --> 01:32.603
So, you ladies going
to the spring dance?

01:32.604 --> 01:34.409
I love spring.

01:34.410 --> 01:36.176
Everything just smells

01:36.177 --> 01:37.608
so fresh.

01:39.297 --> 01:41.863
Ah... So, you guys

01:41.864 --> 01:43.109
know anybody
that still doesn't have

01:43.110 --> 01:44.084
a date for the dance?

01:44.085 --> 01:44.918
No.

01:44.919 --> 01:46.512
'Cause Ben Sturkey's looking.

01:50.727 --> 01:52.615
Oh, man. Poor Ben.

01:52.616 --> 01:55.126
He is so desperate to
find a date to the dance.

01:55.127 --> 01:56.973
Desperate is not good.

01:59.157 --> 02:00.408
Please ask me to the dance.

02:00.409 --> 02:01.574
Please.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.595
Rae, I've always wanted you
to be my girlfriend.

02:09.633 --> 02:11.304
Chelsea, I just
saw Gabriel

02:11.305 --> 02:12.679
ask me to be
his girlfriend

02:12.680 --> 02:13.779
at the Renaissance dance

02:13.780 --> 02:15.876
and he's going as a prince.

02:15.877 --> 02:17.316
My prince.

02:19.086 --> 02:21.092
Hey, Rae, guess
who just told me

02:21.093 --> 02:22.447
he wants to ask
you to the dance.

02:22.448 --> 02:23.937
Oh, I have a pretty good idea

02:23.938 --> 02:27.437
and, trust me,
I will be ready for him.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.625
Good for you. I mean,
'cause not a lot of girls

02:30.626 --> 02:32.450
would go with
Stinky Sturkey.

02:32.451 --> 02:34.098
You know,
that's just the kind of girl...

02:34.589 --> 02:36.384
I'm going where with who?

03:26.257 --> 03:27.613
Yep, that's me.

03:33.001 --> 03:35.622
There is no way
I can DJ this dance, Chelsea.

03:35.623 --> 03:36.716
Eddie, why not?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.879
Because you picked this lame
Renaissance theme.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.676
I mean, I could
have done '50s sock hop.

03:40.677 --> 03:42.444
I could have even
done-- what?-- Motown.

03:42.445 --> 03:44.647
I would have even done
country-western.

03:44.648 --> 03:45.916
All the cowboys
in the house

03:45.917 --> 03:46.881
say, "Ho!"

03:46.882 --> 03:48.102
See the activity I'm doing

03:48.103 --> 03:49.599
I could have did
it real good.

03:50.595 --> 03:54.895
Eddie, the Elizabethan era
was cool and it was exciting.

03:54.896 --> 03:57.337
You know, there was
dancing and jousting

03:57.338 --> 03:58.802
and juggling and...

03:59.626 --> 04:01.419
Plus, I'm the head

04:01.420 --> 04:02.476
of the Dance Committee

04:02.477 --> 04:07.585
so that means I get to be
your queen... therefore

04:07.586 --> 04:09.738
I command you to be the DJ!

04:12.852 --> 04:14.323
Please.

04:35.193 --> 04:36.693
Have you seen
Raven Baxter?

04:44.522 --> 04:46.896
Help me! Help me! Hide me!

04:46.897 --> 04:48.067
He's coming after me.

04:48.068 --> 04:49.095
He's coming after me.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.408
Uh, Rae-- the
bale is not

04:53.409 --> 04:54.765
hiding the booty.

04:56.817 --> 04:58.051
You guys

04:58.052 --> 05:00.847
I have been running
from Ben all day.

05:01.193 --> 05:04.814
You know, Rae, if he asks you,
you could just say no.

05:05.342 --> 05:07.977
I know, but he's
such a sweet guy

05:07.978 --> 05:09.226
I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

05:09.227 --> 05:11.809
Besides, I just want Gabriel
to ask me first so I can say

05:11.810 --> 05:13.213
"Gee, Ben, I'm sorry

05:13.214 --> 05:14.874
but I already have
a date to the dance.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.308
Oh. So, Gabriel
takes you to the dance.

05:17.309 --> 05:19.212
He asks you to be his girlfriend

05:19.213 --> 05:20.529
and then your vision comes true.

05:20.530 --> 05:22.263
I wasn't thinking that far ahead

05:22.264 --> 05:23.760
but that's all good to me.

05:29.824 --> 05:31.522
He's a hundred feet and closing.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.542
I still have time to escape.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.295
Did I just
see Raven come in here?

05:59.296 --> 06:02.848
Uh... I have not seen
Raven anywhere.

06:03.919 --> 06:07.683
It's funny, 'cause I feel like
I just keep...

06:08.638 --> 06:11.262
missing... her.

06:16.322 --> 06:17.652
All right, well,
I'll see you.

06:22.036 --> 06:22.892
Hey.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.121
Hey.

06:25.122 --> 06:29.076
Uh, no... Hay,
stuck in your hair.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.981
Look, there's Gabriel.

06:37.982 --> 06:40.172
Okay, if my vision's
going to come true

06:40.173 --> 06:42.222
I've got to get him to
ask me to that dance.

06:45.997 --> 06:48.074
Hey, Gabriel, nice camera.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.119
Uh, this?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.623
Nah. This is just the
multizone autofocus

06:51.624 --> 06:53.169
with the 200-millimeter
zoom lens.

06:53.825 --> 06:57.029
Oh, well, you know,
I can throw mine away.

06:59.867 --> 07:00.952
Nice picture.

07:00.953 --> 07:01.963
But, uh...

07:01.964 --> 07:03.007
I wasn't even ready.

07:03.008 --> 07:04.684
Oh, but those are the best ones.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.853
You see, I like things
that are spontaneous.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.508
You do?

07:08.509 --> 07:11.086
Well, you know, there's
a dance tomorrow night.

07:11.087 --> 07:13.045
Yeah, I know, but I'm not going.

07:13.046 --> 07:14.164
Oh, me neither.

07:14.165 --> 07:15.289
Isn't that funny?

07:15.290 --> 07:17.071
You're not going--
I'm not going.

07:17.072 --> 07:18.546
How come you're not going?

07:18.547 --> 07:20.667
I'm just not really
into dancing.

07:20.668 --> 07:21.966
I hate dancing.
Me neither.

07:22.857 --> 07:26.626
But your shirt says,
"Loves to Dance."

07:29.671 --> 07:32.065
Well, that's,
that's, that's because...

07:32.965 --> 07:34.203
I borrowed it from her.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.469
She's a dancing fool.

07:36.604 --> 07:40.390
Well, yeah, I'm just
a dancing fool.

07:41.922 --> 07:43.453
That's enough,
dancing, fool.

07:44.135 --> 07:45.651
Okay.

07:45.652 --> 07:47.056
You know, I really
don't even know

07:47.057 --> 07:48.262
why they have
these spring dances.

07:48.263 --> 07:50.080
Nobody even dances.

07:50.081 --> 07:51.095
But, you know, they're good

07:51.096 --> 07:52.675
for a lot of different things.

07:52.676 --> 07:55.169
I mean, people talk,
you know, socialize.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.986
Relationships are formed.

07:56.987 --> 07:58.114
You know what?

07:58.115 --> 07:58.903
I'd love to.

07:58.904 --> 08:01.889
Great, because
that's Riley's seat.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.043
Right. Okay.

08:11.652 --> 08:13.402
He is so wrong, Rae.

08:14.304 --> 08:16.129
That's Matthew's seat.

08:20.443 --> 08:22.448
Rae, I don't know
about this petticoat.

08:22.449 --> 08:24.132
It doesn't
seem very royal.

08:25.307 --> 08:27.816
Well, unless the queen
wants her royal pants

08:27.817 --> 08:28.640
stuck in her royal butt

08:28.641 --> 08:31.775
she'd better be royally
quiet. Okay? All right.

08:32.697 --> 08:34.538
So, Rae, um...
do you think

08:34.539 --> 08:36.785
you'd go to the dance with Ben
if he didn't smell?

08:36.787 --> 08:38.928
Honestly? No. I mean,
he's a nice guy

08:38.929 --> 08:41.003
but unless he took a shower
and came out as Gabriel

08:41.004 --> 08:42.308
it ain't there for me.

08:42.308 --> 08:44.267
Well, you can't just
hide from him forever.

08:44.268 --> 08:45.867
Girl, I don't need
forever. Okay?

08:45.868 --> 08:47.650
I just need enough time
for my future boyfriend

08:47.651 --> 08:49.034
to ask me to the dance.

08:49.035 --> 08:51.496
Rae, I mean, I've been
kinda sorta

08:51.497 --> 08:53.938
holding this back
because I knew you'd feel...

08:56.192 --> 08:59.053
I heard that Gabriel is
taking Rachel to the dance.

09:01.871 --> 09:03.151
Really?

09:03.152 --> 09:04.565
Oh, Rae,
I'm sorry.

09:06.422 --> 09:07.379
Hey, Raven

09:07.380 --> 09:09.158
your stinky
boyfriend's here.

09:09.159 --> 09:10.481
Oh, no. Ben found me.

09:10.482 --> 09:12.763
At your house. Imagine that.

09:14.013 --> 09:15.028
You know what,
Corey?

09:15.029 --> 09:16.735
I need you to get
rid of him for me.

09:16.736 --> 09:19.458
Too bad some guys
just can't read woman.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.714
If a girl doesn't like you

09:21.715 --> 09:23.229
she doesn't like you.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.947
But if she likes you

09:24.948 --> 09:25.936
you know it.

09:25.937 --> 09:28.009
Ain't that right,
baby?

09:29.291 --> 09:30.947
Be gone.

09:31.836 --> 09:34.459
Okay, but I'll be back.

09:36.452 --> 09:37.751
Leave him to me.

09:37.752 --> 09:39.807
I'll let him down easy.

09:43.090 --> 09:44.181
Raven told me
to tell you

09:44.182 --> 09:46.382
she's not hiding
upstairs in her bedroom.

09:47.422 --> 09:48.681
Got it.

09:48.682 --> 09:50.056
Now if you'll excuse me

09:50.057 --> 09:51.297
I'm due back in surgery.

09:54.739 --> 09:56.209
Tell your sister
I get the message.

09:58.843 --> 09:59.859
Hey, Ben.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.088
Oh, that's okay.

10:01.089 --> 10:02.486
Your brother
made things pretty clear.

10:02.487 --> 10:04.050
Hey, Ben,
how would you like

10:04.051 --> 10:05.322
to go to the dance
with me?

10:07.250 --> 10:08.856
You want to go with me?

10:08.857 --> 10:09.851
Why not?

10:09.852 --> 10:11.730
I mean, you don't have a date

10:11.731 --> 10:13.346
I definitely don't got a date

10:13.347 --> 10:14.916
and now we do.

10:14.917 --> 10:15.967
Really?

10:15.968 --> 10:16.904
Yeah.

10:16.905 --> 10:18.341
Score.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.409
Well, uh,
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

10:21.410 --> 10:24.371
Oh... me and my mom
will pick you up.

10:32.595 --> 10:35.376
Rae, what'd you just do?

10:35.377 --> 10:37.507
Look, okay,
he's a nice guy

10:37.508 --> 10:38.847
and he wants
to go with me.

10:38.848 --> 10:40.701
Besides, I'm not going with
the guy that I want to go with

10:40.702 --> 10:41.931
so what's the big deal?

10:44.271 --> 10:45.341
Hello?

10:47.512 --> 10:48.784
Hi, Gabriel.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.260
You want to go
to the dance with me?

10:51.261 --> 10:52.885
What? You're
going with Ben...

10:54.282 --> 10:57.439
But I kind of heard that
you were going with Rachel.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.079
It ain't true, huh?

11:02.933 --> 11:05.458
Look, Gabriel,
um, it's really sweet of you

11:05.459 --> 11:06.722
to ask me to the dance, but...

11:07.145 --> 11:08.934
I'd love to go!

11:08.935 --> 11:10.520
Okay, bye.

11:14.122 --> 11:16.219
What? I love to dance.

11:23.052 --> 11:25.576
The only way I'm going
to get out of this date with Ben

11:25.577 --> 11:30.313
is for him to find me
disgusting and repulsive.

11:30.314 --> 11:33.309
Have you tried standing
this close to him?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.439
Okay... look.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.986
I don't want
to hurt Ben's feelings

11:40.987 --> 11:42.802
so the only way
to get through it

11:42.803 --> 11:44.136
is to get him to dump me.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.401
Well, let me just pull out

11:45.402 --> 11:47.810
my "What's Disgusting
About Raven" file.

11:47.811 --> 11:49.197
Let me see, what
do we have here?

11:49.198 --> 11:51.005
You have a file on that?

11:51.006 --> 11:53.761
Let's start with the A's,
shall we?

11:55.057 --> 11:57.051
You have it alphabetical?

11:57.052 --> 12:01.614
Alphabetical, by date,
by location and by body part.

12:01.615 --> 12:02.835
How do you want it?

12:04.138 --> 12:05.512
Surprise me.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.003
Okay, body parts.

12:10.099 --> 12:12.781
You clip your toenails
at the kitchen table.

12:12.782 --> 12:13.865
I do not.

12:13.866 --> 12:16.593
You blow your nose
and then look in the tissue.

12:17.749 --> 12:20.628
That was once,
and it was a surprising color.

12:24.382 --> 12:25.781
You could make a wig

12:25.782 --> 12:27.816
from all the hair you
leave in the shower drain.

12:27.817 --> 12:30.325
Okay, now, that is ridiculous.

12:31.807 --> 12:34.352
The truth isn't pretty,
my friend.

12:36.650 --> 12:38.166
Okay, look, that's Ben.

12:38.167 --> 12:39.617
I'm going to go upstairs
and get ready.

12:39.618 --> 12:42.386
You let him in,
and start making me look bad.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.349
A job I was born to do.

12:50.422 --> 12:52.668
I'm here to fetch fair Raven.

12:54.052 --> 12:56.316
She's upstairs deciding
whether she can get away with

12:56.317 --> 12:58.084
the same underwear three days
in a row.

12:58.085 --> 12:59.328
Come in.

13:02.937 --> 13:04.765
So, I see
you're wearing armor.

13:04.766 --> 13:06.217
Smart man.

13:07.135 --> 13:08.121
What do you mean?

13:08.122 --> 13:09.849
Have you ever seen Raven eat?

13:09.850 --> 13:11.608
She's like a blender
without the lid.

13:11.609 --> 13:13.475
Brrrr... plat!

13:15.048 --> 13:17.463
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.346
I didn't finish shaving.

13:18.347 --> 13:19.518
Ooh, nice suit.

13:19.519 --> 13:20.218
Let me...

13:20.219 --> 13:21.473
Oh, uh...

13:21.985 --> 13:23.462
you shave.

13:23.463 --> 13:25.649
Twice a day. You know?

13:25.650 --> 13:27.391
Oh, and if you don't
want to be seen with me

13:27.392 --> 13:28.708
I totally understand.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.821
Oh, no, Raven, I care
about what's on the inside.

13:32.401 --> 13:33.432
Oh, you do?

13:33.433 --> 13:34.750
Oh, that's great.

13:34.751 --> 13:36.302
Well, could you help me out?

13:36.303 --> 13:37.448
Look in here. Wait...

13:37.449 --> 13:38.969
Is there a bat in the cave?

13:39.815 --> 13:41.023
No. Check me.

13:51.203 --> 13:53.807
Dance, peasants, dance!

13:59.382 --> 14:02.923
Oh, welcome to my merry,
merry feast, sir knight

14:02.924 --> 14:05.036
and... ugly hag.

14:07.966 --> 14:11.093
Hey, Ben, do you mind
getting me some punch?

14:11.094 --> 14:13.789
Oh, oh, we haveth no punch,
only grog.

14:13.790 --> 14:16.008
Fine. Diet grog,
grog, I don't care.

14:16.009 --> 14:18.187
Just grog me.
Okay, thanks.

14:20.052 --> 14:21.596
Well, at least
he doesn't smell tonight.

14:21.597 --> 14:22.985
Girl, it must
be that armor.

14:22.986 --> 14:26.119
I mean, the stink is sealed
in there like a can of tuna.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.481
Oh, look, there's Gabriel.

14:32.482 --> 14:34.407
Rae, you cannot let him
see you like that.

14:34.408 --> 14:36.561
Girl, you know I got
it covered. Please.

14:38.022 --> 14:39.851
All right, all right, all right.

14:39.852 --> 14:43.311
This one here goes out to all
the pretty ladies in the castle.

14:43.312 --> 14:47.666
Tonight we're going to party
like it's 1599!

14:56.222 --> 14:58.481
Eddie, no one's dancing.

14:58.482 --> 15:01.602
You try to get a groove going
with the music you gave me.

15:01.603 --> 15:05.019
Edward! Do not question
your queen.

15:05.020 --> 15:07.716
Now return
to your castle of funk

15:07.717 --> 15:10.182
and get thee jiggy with it.

15:10.864 --> 15:13.052
You got problems.

15:20.584 --> 15:21.956
If I knew you were going
to get so dressed up

15:21.957 --> 15:23.377
I would have worn pants.

15:24.584 --> 15:27.083
So, who are you supposed to be,
Prince Charming, or something?

15:27.084 --> 15:29.060
No, actually,
Charming was taken

15:29.061 --> 15:31.067
so you're stuck with
Prince Congeniality.

15:31.068 --> 15:34.164
Not really charming, but...
I'm popular around the castle.

15:35.579 --> 15:36.561
I could listen to you

15:36.562 --> 15:37.678
talk forever.

15:39.278 --> 15:40.986
But not right now.

15:40.987 --> 15:42.483
Okay.
What...?

15:42.484 --> 15:43.890
Hey, eat, drink, be merry.

15:43.891 --> 15:44.713
Love me, miss me.

15:44.714 --> 15:45.430
Okay.

15:51.046 --> 15:52.181
Jester.

15:52.182 --> 15:53.616
You have displeased me.

15:53.617 --> 15:56.570
To... the stocks!

15:59.182 --> 16:01.070
Hey, come on,
let's dance, okay?

16:01.071 --> 16:02.126
It may be kind of hard
in this

16:02.127 --> 16:03.116
but I can take it off.

16:03.117 --> 16:04.522
No!

16:19.552 --> 16:21.386
What? They were finally dancing.

16:21.387 --> 16:23.788
Your queen is not amused.

16:23.789 --> 16:25.848
We need the classics.

16:25.849 --> 16:27.387
Well, it's Motown!

16:28.322 --> 16:29.952
I want something more like this.

16:37.682 --> 16:38.951
Protect your queen!

16:38.952 --> 16:41.216
Protect your queen!
Protect your queen!

16:41.217 --> 16:42.810
Protect your queen!

16:52.843 --> 16:54.171
Hey, uh, I can't see.

16:54.172 --> 16:56.567
Oh, well, then just
feel the music. Okay.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.728
So... something you want
to tell me?

17:05.729 --> 17:06.670
Yeah.

17:10.454 --> 17:11.901
What's that on your tooth?

17:11.902 --> 17:13.134
My tooth?

17:15.252 --> 17:17.324
My tooth. Right.

17:17.325 --> 17:18.699
Well, actually...

17:20.452 --> 17:21.781
Hi, Chelsea.

17:21.781 --> 17:26.152
Well, you've managed
to bump the royal heinie!

17:27.722 --> 17:29.085
To the stocks.

17:29.086 --> 17:29.972
Chelsea?

17:29.973 --> 17:30.759
To the stocks!

17:30.760 --> 17:31.528
Chelsea...

17:31.529 --> 17:33.299
Now, to the stocks. Go!

17:33.300 --> 17:34.640
Chelsea, no!

17:34.641 --> 17:37.479
Just play along
and accept your punishment.

17:42.089 --> 17:43.648
So, how are things going

17:43.649 --> 17:45.602
with Prince Charming
and Sir Stink-alot?

17:46.271 --> 17:48.787
Not good. Okay?

17:48.788 --> 17:51.274
Gabriel hasn't asked me
to be his girlfriend

17:51.275 --> 17:53.122
Ben, he-he hasn't dumped me

17:53.123 --> 17:55.222
and my best friend
just put me in the stocks.

17:55.223 --> 17:56.180
So, come here, look.

17:56.181 --> 17:58.745
I am psychic,
and I didn't see this coming.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.989
Man, so how long do you
think you can keep this up?

18:01.990 --> 18:04.972
Just long enough for Gabriel
and I to have some alone time.

18:04.973 --> 18:08.215
But for some reason,
Ben keeps hanging around me.

18:08.813 --> 18:12.445
I don't know, Rae, maybe
it's because he's your date.

18:14.122 --> 18:15.752
Oh, look, look.

18:18.290 --> 18:19.608
Gabriel's going
into the hall.

18:19.609 --> 18:20.530
This is my chance.

18:20.531 --> 18:21.651
I got to get out of here.

18:21.652 --> 18:25.087
Eddie? Eddie, I can't...
I can't get out of here.

18:25.088 --> 18:26.341
It's locked, Rae,
it's locked.

18:26.342 --> 18:27.703
Well, there's just no time.

18:28.782 --> 18:30.315
And now...

18:30.316 --> 18:32.406
let the jousting begin!

19:04.486 --> 19:06.794
Rae. Rae!

19:06.795 --> 19:08.786
Rachel, just stop
and talk to me.

19:08.787 --> 19:09.681
What?

19:09.682 --> 19:12.242
Rachel, I really wanted to
come to the dance with you.

19:12.243 --> 19:14.243
Then why are you here
with Raven Baxter?

19:14.244 --> 19:16.171
Because you said yes to Jarrod

19:16.172 --> 19:18.789
and Raven's been
dropping hints all week.

19:19.187 --> 19:21.207
Look, she's a nice girl

19:21.208 --> 19:23.353
and she really wanted to go
with me.

19:23.806 --> 19:25.108
Look, I felt
bad for her

19:25.109 --> 19:26.531
so I just asked her
to the dance.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.259
It's no big deal.

19:28.559 --> 19:29.656
Do you like her?

19:29.657 --> 19:30.747
No.

19:31.223 --> 19:33.481
Look, it's just
a pity date.

19:33.482 --> 19:35.382
It doesn't
mean anything.

19:36.964 --> 19:39.530
Rae, I've always wanted you
to be my girlfriend.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.558
I can't believe this.

19:49.559 --> 19:52.564
Gabriel took me to the dance
because he felt sorry for me.

19:53.072 --> 19:54.432
A pity date?

19:54.882 --> 19:56.703
I mean, how could he do this?

19:56.704 --> 19:58.428
I really liked this guy.

19:58.429 --> 19:59.907
How could he do that to me?

20:01.283 --> 20:03.082
Sort of like what
you did to Ben.

20:06.025 --> 20:07.545
Yeah, right.

20:15.450 --> 20:16.743
Hey, Ben.

20:18.394 --> 20:19.932
I've got to tell you something

20:19.933 --> 20:24.390
and it's really hard to say,
so... I'm just going to say it.

20:25.617 --> 20:27.851
I shouldn't have asked you
to the dance.

20:27.852 --> 20:31.130
I mean, the only reason I did
was because I knew you liked me

20:31.131 --> 20:33.956
and I thought if I asked you
I would be nice and...

20:34.759 --> 20:37.753
I guess it really wasn't
very nice, was it?

20:38.311 --> 20:41.854
And I really...
I'm really sorry, Ben.

20:42.885 --> 20:45.364
I know this is hard
to hear, but...

20:46.054 --> 20:48.950
Ben. Ben, speak to me.

20:58.052 --> 21:00.651
Um, how much of that
did you hear?

21:00.652 --> 21:03.962
Well, unless there was
a good part, all of it.

21:05.724 --> 21:08.216
Ben, I really want
us to be friends.

21:08.217 --> 21:09.782
That's good, right?

21:12.122 --> 21:13.753
You hate me, don't you?

21:16.462 --> 21:18.157
I could never hate you.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.696
He might hate you,
but...

21:22.103 --> 21:23.159
I never could.

21:27.316 --> 21:30.582
So, um... still need
a date to the dance?

21:31.119 --> 21:32.587
Come on, my lady.

21:33.478 --> 21:35.736
I mean, you know,
it could've been worse.

21:35.737 --> 21:37.495
You could've been here
with another guy.

21:40.044 --> 21:41.196
You don't know who you're

21:41.197 --> 21:42.115
dealing with!

21:42.116 --> 21:43.555
I am your queen!

21:43.556 --> 21:44.847
Eddie, tell them!

21:44.848 --> 21:46.993
Off with her head!

21:54.071 --> 21:56.225
You've got that
mole on your foot

21:56.226 --> 21:58.250
that looks like
an extra toe.

21:58.251 --> 22:00.551
It's over, Corey.

22:00.552 --> 22:03.953
The only thing that grows faster
than the hair on your head

22:03.954 --> 22:05.452
is the hair on your lip.
