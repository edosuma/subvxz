WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:05.396
This is such a fun way
to celebrate

00:05.440 --> 00:07.355
you guys finishing
the mini mall.

00:07.398 --> 00:09.748
Hey, did Lisa say what
our next project is?
Mm-mm.

00:09.792 --> 00:13.404
The next project
I will be working on is...

00:13.448 --> 00:14.753
myself!

00:14.797 --> 00:16.581
I'm going
on sabbatical.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.366
So what are we gonna
be building?

00:18.409 --> 00:19.932
Well, I don't know
about you two,

00:19.976 --> 00:21.978
but I'll be building a new me.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.373
She might have to take that
thing down to the studs.

00:25.416 --> 00:28.376
We just lost our jobs.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.465
This commercial is important
to Burns Brothers,

00:30.508 --> 00:32.293
so I think I should meet
the guy who's playing me.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.295
I'm Leif Forrest.
I'm sorry?

00:34.338 --> 00:35.818
Leif... Forrest.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.559
[laughing]

00:37.602 --> 00:40.344
What's the matter?
I just got laid off.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.216
I guess now
neither of us are working.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.393
[horn honking]

00:45.436 --> 00:47.786
Oh, okay, kids.
Your carpool's here.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.398
You guys aren't
going anywhere today?

00:50.441 --> 00:53.096
Teddy, I told you
we're temporarily unemployed.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.445
I want to be unemployed.

00:54.489 --> 00:57.405
Oh, you will be.

00:57.448 --> 01:00.321
Okay, let's not be
so honest. Come on.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.108
So we're busting
our humps all day

01:05.152 --> 01:06.544
while you two get
to sit around?

01:06.588 --> 01:09.460
Yeah, it's like
we're the kids now.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.723
Bring us back some food
and money.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.553
[giggles]
[giggles]

01:15.597 --> 01:17.816
Ah, look at us.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.514
We got the house
to ourselves.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.386
You know, we should
make the most of this.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.606
Yeah, well, we're not
gonna be unemployed long.

01:24.649 --> 01:27.609
I got my commercial running,
you sent out résumés.

01:27.652 --> 01:31.613
Oh, and they really stand out
'cause they include a bribe.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.659
See, I clipped a Starbucks
gift card to each one.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.314
Andi, those
things cost money.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.838
Not if you don't
put any money on it.

01:39.882 --> 01:42.841
That's my girl.

01:42.885 --> 01:46.584
[laughs]
My thrifty,
morally-challenged girl.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.370
[laughs]
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.676
We should just enjoy
being together.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.592
Yeah. You're my
favorite person.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.681
I'm your favorite person.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.509
We're like those two
trees in the backyard

01:58.553 --> 02:00.076
that grow closer
together every year.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.644
Oh. That is poetic.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.559
I love your stories.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.735
It's so charming
how you see the world.
Oh.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.954
You know, that boy tree
is ten years younger

02:08.998 --> 02:11.174
than the girl tree.
Pretty good for her, huh?

02:11.218 --> 02:12.436
Yeah.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.351
[both laughing]

02:14.395 --> 02:16.527
Oh, yeah, come on. Get
those puppies up here.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.486
[laughs]
So...
[clears throat]

02:18.529 --> 02:20.096
What should we do today?

02:20.140 --> 02:23.491
I say that we watch TV,
and only get up

02:23.534 --> 02:26.494
when we need to replace
the batteries in the remote.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.104
I do not deserve you.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.584
[giggles]

02:29.627 --> 02:32.500
No man does.

02:40.682 --> 02:43.250
Yesterday when I was
getting the mail,

02:43.293 --> 02:47.384
I saw this caterpillar inching
his way down the sidewalk.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.386
It looked exactly like...

02:49.430 --> 02:50.866
BOTH:
The neighbor lady's mustache.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.128
Yeah.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.001
You've told
that story twice.

02:56.045 --> 02:59.179
Thought I was poetic.

02:59.222 --> 03:02.573
People repeat poems.

03:02.617 --> 03:05.533
Might I remind you of the
"Man from Nantucket" series?

03:05.576 --> 03:07.578
As in, "There once was
a man from Nantucket"?

03:07.622 --> 03:10.102
Okay, yeah, yeah, I got it.

03:11.626 --> 03:14.063
[sighs]

03:16.283 --> 03:19.547
Uh... what's this?

03:20.635 --> 03:22.506
My puppies.
[laughs]

03:22.550 --> 03:25.509
[barks]:
Arf, arf.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.731
Foot person gets
the remote, too?

03:29.774 --> 03:31.820
Ugh. I guess the
rich get richer.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.431
What's wrong?

03:34.475 --> 03:37.129
I just can't
sit around all day

03:37.173 --> 03:38.783
with your hot
feet in my lap

03:38.827 --> 03:40.611
watching reruns of
the Gilmore Girls.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.613
I get it. You had
your daughter young.

03:42.657 --> 03:45.137
Move on. You're
making me crazy!

03:47.052 --> 03:49.620
Okay, well, you want
to watch Rush Hour 3again

03:49.664 --> 03:52.449
so you can say every line
along with the actors?

03:52.493 --> 03:54.973
I do that?

03:55.017 --> 03:57.237
[chuckling]:
Yeah. It's funny.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.152
At first.
Oh.

04:00.196 --> 04:04.244
Look, I love you
very much, but...

04:04.287 --> 04:06.202
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.030
I'm sick of being around you.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.554
That is music to my ears.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.557
I'm sick of being
around you, too!

04:13.601 --> 04:15.124
[laughs]

04:15.167 --> 04:16.691
We are so cute.

04:16.734 --> 04:20.303
Hey, so, how do we get you
back to work?
Ugh.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.480
You know, I mean, do we go out
and knock on some doors

04:23.524 --> 04:25.265
and see who needs
new kitchens?

04:25.308 --> 04:27.310
The quickest way to
put me back to work is

04:27.354 --> 04:29.704
to get Lisa McCaffrey
out of her cuckoo's nest.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.837
So let's take her out
for drinks.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.449
Maybe we can speed
this whole thing up,

04:35.492 --> 04:39.191
you know, patch the cracks
in her attic.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.497
That's a great idea.

04:40.541 --> 04:43.021
We're a great team.
We are.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.588
We were meant
to be together.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.199
Just not all the time.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.724
Exactly.
[both laugh]

04:49.767 --> 04:51.726
I'm gonna go read a book
in the pantry.

04:51.769 --> 04:54.294
Anywhere but
here, baby.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.991
Ha!

04:57.079 --> 04:59.081
♪

05:07.089 --> 05:09.352
I'm just saying, if you'd
seen the caterpillar,

05:09.396 --> 05:10.919
you'd like the story better.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.182
It looked exactly
like a mustache.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.793
It was Tom Selleck
on a sidewalk.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.229
Stay focused, okay?

05:17.273 --> 05:18.796
We've got to cheer Lisa up

05:18.840 --> 05:20.320
so we can get both of you
back to work.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.626
This morning,
I needed alone time so bad,

05:22.670 --> 05:24.367
almost went on a walk.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.326
A walk, Adam.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.807
Here she comes.
Okay, remember,

05:29.851 --> 05:31.331
this is just a patch job.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.028
We're not responsible
for any structural problems.

05:33.071 --> 05:35.509
And no matter
what she says,

05:35.552 --> 05:36.945
we tell her she's
making progress, okay?

05:36.988 --> 05:37.946
Got it.
Hey, hey!

05:37.989 --> 05:39.295
Hi.
Hello, you two.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.905
Lisa.
[laughs]

05:40.949 --> 05:42.472
[sighs]
Ah, it's so good
to see you.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.039
How-how you doing?
Oh.

05:44.082 --> 05:47.085
Wildly depressed.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.218
I haven't felt this lonely
since my divorce.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.263
I started talking
to my reflection in the mirror,

05:51.307 --> 05:52.917
but conversation is difficult

05:52.961 --> 05:55.572
because we keep interrupting
each other.

05:55.616 --> 05:59.750
That right there-- that
is textbook progress.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.665
I say it's time
to get back on the job.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.319
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, yeah.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.929
Studies show

06:04.973 --> 06:08.237
that people who quit working
die almost immediately.
Hmm.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.499
Well, the way I've been feeling,

06:09.543 --> 06:11.849
it could be months
before I get back to work.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.938
Hmm.
Well...

06:13.982 --> 06:16.027
You know what?
Uh, I should go.

06:16.071 --> 06:19.857
It's, uh, difficult for me
to be around couples right now,

06:19.901 --> 06:22.207
especially old ones like you

06:22.251 --> 06:25.123
who've made it through most
of their lives together.

06:26.821 --> 06:29.084
Okay, bye.

06:32.609 --> 06:36.091
That's the meanest
compliment we've ever gotten.

06:36.134 --> 06:39.181
Yeah, but at least now
we know what she needs.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.312
Yeah. A straitjacket.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.184
No. A man.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.578
Yeah, a man to put on
the straitjacket,

06:44.621 --> 06:46.580
'cause you can't put
those on by yourself.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.364
That's why magicians
have assistants.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.888
Okay, look, Lisa said
she was too lonely to work,

06:50.932 --> 06:53.543
and I get it. It's-it's...
it's hard on your own.

06:53.587 --> 06:58.069
So if we fix her up
with someone, we fix her.

06:58.113 --> 07:01.029
Yeah, having someone at
home really makes you want

07:01.072 --> 07:02.509
to get out of the house.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.162
Let's make
a love connection, Adam.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.164
Great. All right, let's go home.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.557
I'll make a list of
some guys I don't like.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.167
Spit that out. We can't
afford to eat here.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.955
I can't think of anyone

07:13.998 --> 07:16.000
I dislike enough to
set up with Lisa.

07:16.044 --> 07:19.569
Do we know anyone
who just got out of prison?

07:19.613 --> 07:21.484
I mean, you know,
those guys aren't picky,

07:21.528 --> 07:23.399
and they're used
to crazy roommates.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.228
Okay, uh, hey, listen, before
we go in there, fair warning.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.751
I am laying down
on that couch.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.188
Now, it's fine if you
want to sit on top of me,

07:30.232 --> 07:32.234
but just be prepared to
finish what you start.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.757
Okay.

07:34.802 --> 07:38.153
Aw, come on!

07:38.196 --> 07:41.156
Unemployment blows.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.679
Yeah, tell me about it.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.464
I'm looking at a guy with
my pillow between his legs.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.121
Check it out. Rush Hour 3.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.776
Ooh.
Hey.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.386
Just got dark.
That means it's not weird

07:54.430 --> 07:56.258
for me to go to bed.
Good night, guys.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.392
[groans]

08:00.436 --> 08:03.308
Hey, so listen,
we just saw Lisa.
Yeah.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.528
She's depressed
because she's lonely.

08:05.572 --> 08:09.401
Andi thinks we can get her back
to work if we find her a guy.

08:09.445 --> 08:10.794
That makes sense.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.492
When she realized
she couldn't have me,

08:12.535 --> 08:14.102
she started
going downhill.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.539
So who's the
unlucky fella?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.019
Well, I don't know yet,

08:18.062 --> 08:19.586
but it shouldn't be
that hard to find one.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.196
Yeah.
Getting a girl
is hard.

08:21.239 --> 08:23.198
Getting a guy
who wantsa girl is easy.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.809
All we got to do is tell him
we got a girl.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.332
Yeah, I mean,
we got the beer.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.421
We're just looking
for the party.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.075
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.860
Look, I know playing
matchmaker's a little weird,

08:32.903 --> 08:34.514
but I got
to do something.
Yeah.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.559
Andi and I are spending
all our time together,

08:36.603 --> 08:39.736
and I just discovered--
I can be a lot to take.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.913
Yeah, me, too, but I
didn't have to discover.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.872
Marcy told me ten minutes
before I got here.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.309
Hmm.
Yeah. When I walk in the door,

08:47.352 --> 08:49.746
I want my wife
to be happy to see me,

08:49.790 --> 08:53.620
and the key to that
is less of me.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.100
All right.
I just wish we had
another place to hang out.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.362
[sighs]

08:57.406 --> 08:58.973
Hey, you got
the basement.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.583
Let's move a couch
and a TV down there.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.194
Oh, I'd love to,
but it won't fit.
There's no room.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.805
Aah.
Andi's giant treadmill's
down there.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.850
[sighs]
Does she use it?

09:06.894 --> 09:09.418
Shh!

09:09.461 --> 09:11.246
We don't talk about it.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.944
Well, so ask her if
you can get rid of it.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.381
What are you, a newlywed?

09:16.425 --> 09:18.122
No.
Huh?

09:18.166 --> 09:20.777
Everyone knows you can't talk
to women about exercising.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.824
The last time I mentioned it,
it did not go well.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.960
Hey, yoga pants, heading down
to the basement to exercise?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.660
Well, I am now.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.275
That was a quiet weekend.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.494
Ooh.
I know what I'll do.

09:42.538 --> 09:45.280
I'll just throw it away,
and I won't say anything.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.977
That could work.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.371
That's what I do when
Marcy cooks a meatloaf.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.377
LOWELL:
I'm so glad

09:55.420 --> 09:57.814
you guys called. I've been
stuck home with my kids.

09:57.858 --> 10:01.296
They tell the same stories
over and over.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.342
Lowell, if it's a good
story, it never gets old.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.344
Okay, come on, guys.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.477
We got to figure out
who to set Lisa up with.
Mm.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.696
We need a gentleman.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.436
I'll check out the bathroom,
and come back

10:11.480 --> 10:12.916
with the first guy
who washes his hands.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.226
Okay, check out
the guy behind me.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.270
His date is a book.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.445
Watch this.
Oh, yeah.

10:22.491 --> 10:26.016
Hey, uh, I noticed
you were alone, and, uh...

10:26.060 --> 10:28.410
we've got a girl.

10:28.453 --> 10:31.282
That sounds creepy.

10:31.326 --> 10:35.025
[chuckles]: No, no.
She's not in a cage or anything.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.679
Listen, I know the manager.

10:36.723 --> 10:37.941
What's your name?

10:37.985 --> 10:40.727
Uh, Lowell. My name's Lowell.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.691
I think we might need
the actual girl here

10:48.735 --> 10:50.388
for this to work.
Yeah.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.390
You're-you're
overcomplicating it.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.654
See leather jacket over there?
Yeah.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.568
I'll just tell him
what I wanted people to tell me

10:56.612 --> 10:57.657
when I was
sitting alone in bars.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.441
Watch.

11:02.574 --> 11:03.750
Hey, big guy.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.186
You look strong.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.929
What'd you say to me?

11:08.972 --> 11:10.582
Nothing. My name's Lowell.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.542
Yeah, I-I'm out of here.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.153
I'm going home.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Sit down.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.416
We got to find a guy for Lisa
so we can get back to work.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.767
[sighs]
The men's room was a bad idea.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.203
I made a mistake
by leading with,

11:22.246 --> 11:23.421
"Are you looking
for a good time?"

11:25.075 --> 11:27.861
Frankly, I'm lucky to be alive.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.471
Well, we're not doing
much better out here.

11:29.514 --> 11:32.039
Oh, and if anybody asks,
your name is not Lowell.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.303
Wait, wait,
what about this guy?

11:35.346 --> 11:36.608
The chicken wing model.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.741
That's Leif Forrest,
the actor we hired

11:38.785 --> 11:40.482
to replace you
in the commercial.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.832
Lisa would like him.
He's single and handsome.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.616
We fired him.
He doesn't like us.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.402
But he likes me. He accidentally
put me into a group text,

11:47.445 --> 11:49.970
and I've been quite active.

11:50.013 --> 11:53.408
Well, if you can get him
on board, I'm all for it.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.279
Great. I'll have him
meet us for lunch.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.846
We don't want
one of these guys, anyway.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.718
Word in the bathroom
is there's a creep here

11:58.761 --> 12:00.589
saying he's got a lady
in a cage.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.687
Hey.
Hey.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.297
Okay, so, Marcy and I

12:13.341 --> 12:14.690
will get Lisa on board
with this blind date thing.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.952
Okay, great.
And then Don and I

12:15.996 --> 12:17.954
will work on
Pittsburgh's gift to acting,

12:17.998 --> 12:19.564
Leif Forrest.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.089
If we play this right,
I will have a job

12:22.132 --> 12:23.830
to go to every day.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.614
It's gonna be nice
to miss you, baby.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.660
[chuckles]

12:28.704 --> 12:30.401
Oh, Andi, come quick!

12:30.445 --> 12:32.273
Is it the caterpillar?

12:33.622 --> 12:36.494
How do you not want to see it?

12:38.235 --> 12:39.584
ADAM:
Okay, listen.

12:39.628 --> 12:40.847
All we got to do
is convince this guy

12:40.890 --> 12:42.152
to hook up with Lisa

12:42.196 --> 12:43.763
and take a ride
down Bonkers Boulevard.

12:43.806 --> 12:44.981
[chuckles]

12:45.025 --> 12:46.635
Go for a swim
in Lunatic Lake.

12:46.678 --> 12:47.549
[laughs]:
Yeah.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.159
Hop on the
Screw Loose Caboose.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.508
[chuckles]
Oh, shh, shh, shh. Here he is.

12:50.552 --> 12:53.555
Adam, Don, you remember Leif.
Sure we do.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.948
From when we fired you.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.820
Ah, it's okay. I'm
used to hostility.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.518
Regular looking people don't
know how to deal with me.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.433
Yeah. Uh, have a seat.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.697
Okay.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.003
[clears throat] Um...

13:07.047 --> 13:08.570
Leif, I know we've had
our differences,

13:08.613 --> 13:10.441
but the reason
we brought you here is...

13:10.485 --> 13:12.443
we've got a girl.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.358
Never been in a cage.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.186
She's cage-free,
like those chickens.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.537
Look, she's a friend of ours,
and she's single.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.713
And my gut tells me
she has not been mingled with

13:21.757 --> 13:23.019
in quite some time.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.326
And we thought you might be
a good match for her.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.284
Yeah. We felt bad
for firing you.

13:27.328 --> 13:30.548
The least we could do is find
you a lovemaking partner.

13:30.592 --> 13:33.160
I'm listening.

13:33.203 --> 13:36.032
So, Adam and I
couldn't help but notice

13:36.076 --> 13:38.730
that you're sort of missing
a companion in your life.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.907
You know, and we both love
being in relationships.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.560
[chuckles]
Most of the time.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.475
But, um, we thought
we could help.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.303
Oh, you would do that?

13:46.347 --> 13:47.696
Well, it might be nice

13:47.739 --> 13:50.090
to share my life
with someone special.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.528
Well, great. So what kind
of man are you looking for?
Hmm.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.052
A handsome doctor.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.880
Well, I don't want
to be shallow about this.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.274
Just handsome.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.842
I can't believe
you're single.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.975
[chuckles]
It's just...
[mimics explosion]

14:06.019 --> 14:07.411
And I've always had a thing

14:07.455 --> 14:09.587
for spirited,
unpredictable women.

14:09.631 --> 14:12.764
Oh, really?

14:12.808 --> 14:16.420
I know it sounds weird,
but I like crazy.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.248
[chuckles]
Well, I know a crazy

14:18.292 --> 14:21.251
that might like you.
[chuckles]

14:21.295 --> 14:23.906
I also want a guy who's
financially dependent on me

14:23.950 --> 14:28.432
so I can have the upper hand
and constantly lord it over him.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.218
My God, you're a monster.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.394
Of love.
[chuckles]

14:33.437 --> 14:35.613
Huh? Right.
Yes, a...

14:35.657 --> 14:39.487
a cuddly, bone-chilling
love monster.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.708
Not only is our friend
delightfully unstable,

14:43.752 --> 14:46.798
she also happens to earn
a pretty good living.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.626
[exhales] That's great.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.845
It's tough

14:49.889 --> 14:51.760
making ends meet
as an actor in Pittsburgh.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.631
They don't appreciate art
around here.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.460
I mean,
I can do seven different faces,

14:56.504 --> 14:58.636
and they are all
totally different.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.029
They're really good. Show them.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.204
Do angry.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.381
You had to pick
the one that I can't do.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.601
That seemed angry to me.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.733
[laughing]:
Well, all right.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.736
That makes eight.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.347
So, are you in?

15:16.393 --> 15:18.047
We're doing it.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.922
Thanks for coming, Leif.
Sure.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.358
She's a rich nutjob.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.794
I'm just glad
you called me first.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.407
He's so pretty,
it's a shame to give him away.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.148
Hey.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.020
Eyes over here, mama.
Oh.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.673
Uh, why don't you guys
go into the living room,

15:35.717 --> 15:37.153
have some hors d'oeuvres,
and we'll be right in.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.676
So, Leif,

15:38.720 --> 15:39.808
what kind of name is that?

15:39.851 --> 15:41.723
Oh, it's my first name.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.380
You know,

15:46.423 --> 15:47.859
I think this could
actually work.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.600
Lisa's an emotional iceberg,

15:49.644 --> 15:51.820
and he's got the brain
of a penguin.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.997
Yeah, if these two hit it off,
she's going back to work,

15:55.041 --> 15:56.781
which means you're
going back to work.

15:56.825 --> 15:57.782
Yeah, which means
I'll have a bunch

15:57.826 --> 15:58.958
of new stories to tell you.
Yeah.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.481
And you'll be telling them

16:00.524 --> 16:02.004
without my feet in your lap.
Yeah.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.745
All right,
let's go close this deal.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.094
[knock at door]

16:05.138 --> 16:08.358
Ooh, that must be her.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.404
Leif, here comes the
rest of your life.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.014
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.363
I-I'm not ready
to meet her.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.669
You haven't even
told me her name yet.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.714
Oh, sorry about that.
Yeah, her name is...

16:16.758 --> 16:18.542
Lisa?!

16:18.586 --> 16:20.501
Wow, great guess.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.068
Leif?!

16:22.111 --> 16:23.895
Wait, you-you guys
know each other?

16:23.939 --> 16:24.896
Is that a good thing
or a...

16:24.940 --> 16:27.595
You son of a bitch.
Got it.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.252
You set me up
with my ex-husband.

16:34.558 --> 16:37.387
Who cheated on me
with a 22-year-old actress

16:37.431 --> 16:40.260
he met working at a car show.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.871
I-I didn't know we couldn't
date other people.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.569
I just thought we couldn't
marry other people.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.051
Uh, hey, h-hold on, hold on.
He's changed.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.357
Yeah. Did you know

16:50.400 --> 16:52.837
he's got a steady job
as a chicken wing model?

16:52.881 --> 16:56.450
Huh? Everybody
loves chicken wings.
Yeah.

16:56.493 --> 17:00.410
I'm leaving. Thank you so much
for setting up this reunion.

17:00.454 --> 17:01.629
Hey, you're not
getting the last word.

17:01.672 --> 17:02.673
I'mgetting the last word.

17:02.717 --> 17:03.805
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

17:03.848 --> 17:04.936
No, you're not!

17:04.980 --> 17:06.112
Ah, she's too good.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.288
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Okay.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.767
Uh, look, we've learned
a lot about you both

17:09.811 --> 17:11.943
over the past few days, and
from where I'm standing,

17:11.987 --> 17:14.424
you're actually perfect
for each other.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.731
Yeah, that's true. I mean,

17:16.774 --> 17:19.255
you only want one thing, and...

17:19.299 --> 17:22.693
he only is one thing.

17:22.737 --> 17:26.088
Yeah, and-and if that one
thing is the right thing,

17:26.132 --> 17:29.048
well, then you got to
hang on to that thing.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.527
You know?
And this is coming

17:30.571 --> 17:32.094
from an old couple
who's made it

17:32.138 --> 17:34.792
almost all the way through
their lives together.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.751
As you so thoughtfully
pointed out.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.796
ADAM: But look,
all we're saying is

17:38.840 --> 17:41.451
don't let go of his thing.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.499
He's right.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.761
Losing you was awful.

17:46.804 --> 17:50.504
Can we at least have
a drink and catch up?

17:50.547 --> 17:54.377
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt
to hear you out,

17:54.421 --> 17:56.553
Mr. Tickles.
[giggles]

17:58.773 --> 18:01.167
Come on, I know a bar with
lots of pictures of me.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.606
Look at that.

18:05.649 --> 18:08.348
There's an ass for every saddle.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.828
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.917
I guess when you
find your person,

18:12.961 --> 18:14.049
you work stuff out.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.224
Yeah.

18:15.268 --> 18:18.706
Your feet are the
perfect temperature.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.490
Aw.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.885
I should've been nicer
about that caterpillar you saw.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.497
You saw a caterpillar?

18:27.541 --> 18:28.672
Yeah, yeah.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.022
It looked like a mustache.
Oh.

18:31.066 --> 18:34.722
Oh! That's great.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.593
That's great.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.857
Hey, have you heard
anything from Lisa?

18:39.901 --> 18:42.469
Yeah. Leif moved
back in with her.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.471
Turns out he was living
in a storage unit.
Oh.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.647
[chuckles]

18:46.690 --> 18:48.866
And, as we predicted,
she's already dying

18:48.910 --> 18:50.912
to get out of the house
and back to work.

18:50.955 --> 18:54.002
Mm. So...

18:54.045 --> 18:56.483
it sounds like our days
on the couch together

18:56.526 --> 18:57.745
are almost over.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.007
Mm.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.356
Tell you what.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.142
Let's watch Rush Hour 3.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.578
Let's go with Gilmore Girls.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.885
I'm a little hooked.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.192
Ah.
Yeah.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.716
I mean, she's her mom, but
she's also her best friend.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.891
Yeah.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.372
Come on.
Aw. [giggles]

19:16.416 --> 19:18.592
[chuckles]
Look at us.

19:18.635 --> 19:19.810
It got good again.

19:19.854 --> 19:20.985
[both chuckle]

19:22.030 --> 19:23.858
They're hot, but it's...

19:23.901 --> 19:25.686
it's a dry heat.
Mm-hmm.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.480
It doesn't fit.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.090
I told you to measure it.
I did.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.701
But it's wider than the door.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.311
You didn't tell me
to measure the door.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.444
Andi's gonna be home
any minute.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.967
If she sees this,

19:46.010 --> 19:47.534
she'll think I'm accusing her
of not exercising.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.275
And we just got good again.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.580
[keys jingling]

19:50.624 --> 19:52.234
That's Andi.
Oh, God, she can't see this.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.323
Uh...

19:54.367 --> 19:56.369
Here, here, here.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.114
What are you doing?

20:03.158 --> 20:05.508
Camouflage.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.294
Hey, guys.
Hey.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.121
What's this?

20:10.165 --> 20:11.732
Dish towel.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.300
Okay, fine.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.084
I was gonna throw it away.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.304
Go ahead.
You never use it anyway.

20:18.347 --> 20:21.263
What? Inever use it?

20:21.307 --> 20:22.873
Me?

20:22.917 --> 20:25.615
I mean, I was gonna say
something, but... [scoffs]

20:25.659 --> 20:28.444
everyone knows you can't talk
to men about exercising.
