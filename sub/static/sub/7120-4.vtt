00:17.763 --> 00:18.917
Get him out!

00:20.483 --> 00:23.917
Don't you ever
let me catch you here again.

00:36.283 --> 00:38.117
Did he get you
with his poison stingers?

00:38.490 --> 00:40.557
No! I got a splinter from the door.

00:40.723 --> 00:41.557
Let me see.

00:41.723 --> 00:43.117
Wow, that's a tiny splinter.

00:43.283 --> 00:44.397
But it hurts!

00:44.563 --> 00:45.877
I'm going to need some...

00:46.699 --> 00:48.117
Fingerprotection!

00:48.283 --> 00:50.717
- Thanks, Choose Goose.
- I am Choose Goose.

00:51.065 --> 00:52.655
Come back for some juice!

00:53.603 --> 00:57.357
- Man, I am so protected right now.
- That is mighty thick.

00:59.043 --> 01:00.151
Go on, hit me!

01:03.771 --> 01:05.637
Hey, guys! Check this out!

01:06.023 --> 01:07.251
Dude, hit me.

01:08.648 --> 01:09.902
On my armor!

01:16.800 --> 01:18.882
That is but a thimble!

01:19.007 --> 01:20.008
This...

01:20.524 --> 01:21.921
is real armor.

01:28.935 --> 01:30.280
Sir Slicer!

01:31.095 --> 01:33.957
Who is the one
that bears the thimble?

01:34.123 --> 01:34.917
This dude.

01:37.312 --> 01:39.258
You foolish boy.

01:39.383 --> 01:43.197
Without full body armor, you're weak!
You do not look...

01:48.479 --> 01:50.517
Choose Goose, I need more armor.

01:50.910 --> 01:54.077
I've got something for you,
a metal shoe!

01:54.388 --> 01:56.717
Don't you know you
might stub your toe?

02:00.070 --> 02:01.757
No Choose Goose, I need...

02:02.203 --> 02:04.957
Look here your
To this one to protect your butt.

02:05.578 --> 02:07.237
To his butt! Protect his butt!

02:07.403 --> 02:09.841
No Choose Goose, I want...

02:09.966 --> 02:12.957
Don't be meek. What if you fall down
and scrape your cheek?

02:13.525 --> 02:15.637
Look at his butt! Look at his butt!

02:17.767 --> 02:20.146
Choose Goose, I want the most...

02:20.650 --> 02:21.597
armor you have!

02:22.422 --> 02:23.423
Have a look!

02:24.923 --> 02:26.674
- I'll take that one.
- Wonderful.

02:26.799 --> 02:29.557
I'll need a trade of equal value.
I'll take the head of your dog friend.

02:29.723 --> 02:30.685
Say what?

02:30.810 --> 02:33.397
No way. Choose Goose,
this stuff is overpriced.

02:33.812 --> 02:35.208
No money for me?

02:35.333 --> 02:37.197
How about a poem for free?

02:41.629 --> 02:42.437
A poem?

02:42.603 --> 02:46.381
If you can decipher the poem
and complete the trials,

02:46.506 --> 02:50.437
you will receive
the magical Armor of Zeldron.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.533
It is foretold to be totally...

02:53.037 --> 02:54.038
Skadow!

02:55.300 --> 02:57.277
Your quest begins
in the marsh over the hill.

02:57.568 --> 03:00.891
- Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor!
- Yeah, man, you're gonna do it.

03:04.065 --> 03:06.095
Good luck exposing your soft,

03:06.220 --> 03:09.250
vanilla-strawberry skin
to the elements, dork!

03:10.877 --> 03:12.037
Later, loosers.

03:14.265 --> 03:17.304
He's just jealous that
I'm gonna have cooler armor than him.

03:17.429 --> 03:19.288
Yeah, what a bumbleberry?

03:22.067 --> 03:23.360
What's the poem say?

03:24.252 --> 03:28.557
"The sun nibbles on the clouds,
and gum drop tears rain down"

03:28.848 --> 03:29.960
I don't get it.

03:32.306 --> 03:34.837
It means that we have to cross
that swamp.

03:35.003 --> 03:36.431
How'd you understand that?

03:36.556 --> 03:39.456
You don't just read the poetry
to understand it.

03:39.843 --> 03:41.512
You got to feel it.

03:42.449 --> 03:44.725
Trust me, dude,
I'm smarter than everyone.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.665
- Now get in there!
- You're not coming?

03:46.790 --> 03:47.637
No way, man.

03:47.803 --> 03:50.357
This armor thing is your deal.
I'll wait for you on the other side.

03:52.528 --> 03:54.197
This place will be a piece of...

03:56.297 --> 03:57.797
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry!

04:02.611 --> 04:06.277
My most private parts
peeped by a boy!

04:09.839 --> 04:11.437
- Pervert!
- I'm not a pervert!

04:11.776 --> 04:13.757
You should be ashamed of yourself!

04:13.923 --> 04:15.037
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

04:16.788 --> 04:18.300
- My privates!
- I'm sorry!

04:18.540 --> 04:20.277
- My privates!
- I'm sorry!

04:21.202 --> 04:23.046
- You okay, man?
- No!

04:27.090 --> 04:28.877
What's the matter, crimson cheeks?

04:29.206 --> 04:30.637
Feeling a little embarrassed

04:30.803 --> 04:32.837
in the swamp of embarrassment?

04:33.003 --> 04:34.717
You're so red,
you look like a tomato.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.357
We'll see who's embarrassed

04:39.523 --> 04:42.373
when I get that armor!
What does the poem say?

04:43.736 --> 04:46.917
"The meadow weeps as morning sings
of milk and honey and things to come"

04:47.083 --> 04:48.237
What does that even?

04:48.643 --> 04:50.597
It means we have to silence,

04:51.203 --> 04:53.077
the echoing in the woods.

04:57.927 --> 05:00.317
Oh, man!
I don't know how to silence that!

05:00.641 --> 05:02.277
All right,
I'll handle this one, dude.

05:02.443 --> 05:04.437
No. This is my burden.

05:04.603 --> 05:06.397
Then just make her
think it's her idea.

05:07.019 --> 05:10.157
That's how you make the ladies
do what you want.

05:10.323 --> 05:11.597
Hey, monster lady!

05:13.088 --> 05:14.291
Stop crying!

05:14.803 --> 05:16.997
Stop crying
because that's what you want to do!

05:27.989 --> 05:30.397
She thinks you're her red-faced baby
or something.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.517
- I think she wants you to nurse, dude.
- No!

05:38.453 --> 05:39.454
Minstrel.

05:42.532 --> 05:44.795
<i>He's Finn the blushing baby</i>

05:45.467 --> 05:47.387
<i>His cheeks are bright and red</i>

05:48.007 --> 05:52.117
<i>Be sure to make fun of him
before you go to bed</i>

05:52.596 --> 05:54.329
Grandfathers will sing that

05:54.454 --> 05:56.637
to their grandchildren
for generations to come.

05:56.803 --> 05:59.317
Grandfathers will not sing that
to their children!

06:02.151 --> 06:03.152
Armor...

06:05.875 --> 06:08.317
Just wait till
I have the Armor of Zeldron!

06:08.483 --> 06:10.355
Yeah, just you wait, weirdo.

06:15.095 --> 06:16.376
Jake, you okay?

06:19.518 --> 06:20.519
Awesome!

06:23.660 --> 06:24.557
Finally.

06:29.203 --> 06:30.077
Hello.

06:30.243 --> 06:32.397
Begone, ghost!
I'm here for the armor!

06:32.838 --> 06:36.637
First, you have to beat my high score
in a game of drop ball.

06:36.803 --> 06:37.757
Drop ball?

06:38.215 --> 06:40.362
Drop ball is an extremely addictive,

06:40.487 --> 06:43.677
high-intensity game designed
for people everywhere.

06:44.182 --> 06:45.669
Here, let me show you.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.459
One point.

06:52.445 --> 06:53.570
Two points.

06:54.165 --> 06:56.517
- Three points.
- This game looks awful.

06:56.788 --> 06:58.068
Oh, no.

06:58.193 --> 07:00.641
I absolutely disagree.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.345
Dude, let's just kill him
and get the armor.

07:03.470 --> 07:04.637
How? He's already dead.

07:05.139 --> 07:06.597
Here. It's your turn.

07:06.975 --> 07:09.070
Now, I don't want you
to be intimidated,

07:09.195 --> 07:11.477
but my high score is six.

07:12.483 --> 07:14.286
Just... just toss it on the ground.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.237
No, no, no!
You're doing it all wrong!

07:21.556 --> 07:23.357
Let me show you how the pros do it.

07:24.646 --> 07:26.837
See? It's all in the technique.

07:27.168 --> 07:30.117
Now, I'm gonna put
a little finesse into it,

07:30.283 --> 07:31.700
just to shake things up.

07:37.362 --> 07:39.651
Finn, it's so beautiful!

07:40.530 --> 07:43.437
Yeah, guess all
the embarrassment was worth it.

07:46.638 --> 07:48.037
Greetings, young traveler.

07:48.409 --> 07:50.157
We know what you seek,

07:50.323 --> 07:52.257
and you shall receive it.

07:55.627 --> 07:56.895
Behold...

07:57.020 --> 07:59.597
the Armor of Zeldron.

08:00.153 --> 08:02.235
It will protect you from evil,

08:02.862 --> 08:03.910
even ghosts.

08:09.463 --> 08:11.920
No! Dude, this is lady armor!

08:14.187 --> 08:16.597
No, not...
No more embarrassment!

08:16.763 --> 08:18.237
I don't need armor!

08:19.364 --> 08:21.517
You did not watch
my drop-ball technique!

08:22.693 --> 08:25.919
I give you firsthand tips
that no one else knows,

08:26.044 --> 08:27.517
and this is how you thank me!

08:28.073 --> 08:30.917
I absolutely disagree with that!

08:35.477 --> 08:37.197
- Now what?
- Put on the armor.

08:37.363 --> 08:39.116
It'll protect you from evil,
even ghosts!

08:39.283 --> 08:40.357
Never!

08:54.883 --> 08:55.677
Mama?

08:58.031 --> 08:58.869
Yeah!

08:58.994 --> 09:01.557
Listen
when your mother is speaking to you.

09:01.926 --> 09:03.677
Yes, mama.

09:04.008 --> 09:06.012
You should be ashamed of yourself,

09:06.137 --> 09:07.473
a boy your age

09:07.598 --> 09:10.797
sitting in this cave alone
for thousands of years.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.397
You need to go outside
and get some sunlight.

09:13.690 --> 09:14.557
But...

09:15.346 --> 09:17.717
No back talk!
Outside now!

09:24.642 --> 09:26.677
Oh, thank you, Finn and Jake!

09:27.125 --> 09:30.517
You've freed me
from the addiction of drop ball.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.621
No problem, dude.
I couldn't have done it without...

09:33.746 --> 09:36.077
the power of embarrassment!

09:36.243 --> 09:38.351
And I learned
I don't need armor to be...

09:43.571 --> 09:45.157
Look at you losers.

09:45.705 --> 09:49.677
Finn, you don't have any armor,
and your friend is dressed like a lady.

09:51.169 --> 09:52.170
So not...

09:52.853 --> 09:55.172
Well, at least I don't spend my day
following a kid around!

09:55.297 --> 09:56.357
Get a life, dude!

09:57.650 --> 09:58.658
Good one, Finn.

09:59.696 --> 10:00.834
Well, I...

10:01.507 --> 10:04.037
just been in the same areas today.

10:04.975 --> 10:06.357
- Yeah, right.
- Whatever.

10:06.902 --> 10:08.014
Be quiet!

10:08.459 --> 10:11.397
I... I am more...
than all of you.

10:11.563 --> 10:13.357
Come over here
and say that to my fist!

10:13.705 --> 10:14.869
Okay, I will.

10:18.598 --> 10:20.597
This armor's too heavy!

10:21.666 --> 10:24.756
No problem. I'll just prop myself up
on this stick.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.437
Splinter!

10:27.789 --> 10:30.607
Hey, Sir Slicer,
maybe you can use this!

10:31.203 --> 10:32.469
Here you go!

10:33.194 --> 10:34.422
Free of charge.

10:35.411 --> 10:37.157
Come on, dude, let's get out of here.

10:38.178 --> 10:39.277
Okay, buddy.

10:42.361 --> 10:44.503
Dude, this armor is totally...
