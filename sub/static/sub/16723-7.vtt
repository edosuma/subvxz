00:19.172 --> 00:21.040
<i>Ugh, even stripes don't help.</i>

00:21.074 --> 00:22.975
His body's an enigma.

00:23.009 --> 00:24.844
Do they make an apron
with a control top?

00:24.845 --> 00:26.245
I think you
look pretty, Dad.

00:26.246 --> 00:28.180
Stop it. I just want
a plain white one.

00:28.181 --> 00:30.916
You can't wear white.
You're not a virgin. Gene.

00:30.951 --> 00:32.151
Hey, there's Mr. Frond.

00:32.185 --> 00:33.919
Oh, hello,
Belcher family.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.354
Classy martini set.

00:35.388 --> 00:37.590
The name's Frond. James Frond.

00:37.591 --> 00:39.992
I've got a license to...
counsel.

00:40.026 --> 00:41.260
Double-oh-so-sad.

00:41.261 --> 00:42.361
Louise, be nice.

00:42.362 --> 00:43.696
Why? It's Mr. Frond.

00:43.697 --> 00:45.253
Ah, Tina, since
I caught you,

00:45.265 --> 00:47.933
your Home Ec teacher Mrs. Woods
is going on disability.

00:47.968 --> 00:51.637
O-M-G. Is she okay? Obviously,
I can't share confidential details.

00:51.638 --> 00:54.073
All I can say is,
she's a drug addict.

00:54.107 --> 00:56.742
So, until she comes back,
we're folding Home Ec in

00:56.743 --> 00:58.377
with Metal Shop.
Metal Shop?

00:58.378 --> 00:59.945
Say good-bye
to your fingers.

00:59.946 --> 01:01.380
You can build
metal fingers.

01:01.414 --> 01:03.616
Boy, it's a shame
to cancel Home Ec.

01:03.617 --> 01:05.384
I mean, everybody needs to learn
how to cook, right?

01:05.385 --> 01:06.619
A lot of kids
aren't lucky enough

01:06.620 --> 01:08.220
to grow up in a restaurant.

01:08.255 --> 01:11.090
Oh! So that's what you
tell yourself. Well, Bob,

01:11.124 --> 01:14.026
maybe you'd like to fill in
as a substitute, huh?

01:14.060 --> 01:16.228
Me, teach? Wow, I mean, I can't.

01:16.229 --> 01:18.697
I-I've got the restaurant
to run. But...

01:18.732 --> 01:21.300
it is an honor
to pass on what you know

01:21.301 --> 01:22.801
to the next generation,
right?

01:22.836 --> 01:25.335
I mean, I might even
change some lives.

01:25.338 --> 01:28.174
What's wrong with Dad?
Frond is right! I can teach kids!

01:28.175 --> 01:30.142
Mmm... I did it with you, Gene.

01:30.143 --> 01:32.044
What the hell,
let's do it.

01:32.078 --> 01:34.313
Wow, this will be great. I've
never been teacher's pet before.

01:34.314 --> 01:36.949
But now I have a huge head start
because Dad already likes me.

01:36.950 --> 01:38.450
Like is a strong word.

01:38.485 --> 01:41.320
Teacher's pet, the gold star
of gold stars.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.659
Mmm...

01:46.660 --> 01:49.662
Ahh...

01:49.663 --> 01:50.863
What are you doing, Tina?

01:50.864 --> 01:51.864
Nothing.

01:51.865 --> 01:53.465
You'll see.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.969
Well, here I am,
all set for my first day.

01:57.003 --> 01:59.271
Oh, my God.
You look so handsome!

01:59.272 --> 02:01.640
Just like Richard Dreyfuss
in <i>Mr. Holland's Old Penis.</i>

02:01.675 --> 02:03.676
Um... Why are you
carrying Mom's old purse?

02:03.677 --> 02:06.645
Oh. I-I thought it kind of
looked like a briefcase.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.847
Go ahead and use it. But let me
take out my pepper spray.

02:08.848 --> 02:10.515
Unless you want to cook with it.

02:10.517 --> 02:12.685
If it's anything like
butter spray, I'm in!

02:12.719 --> 02:14.987
Guys, remember, at
school, I'm Mr. Belcher,

02:14.988 --> 02:17.489
so treat me like you would
any other substitute teacher.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.058
That means you get
a mean nickname

02:19.059 --> 02:21.293
and we assume you live
a horribly depressing life.

02:21.294 --> 02:22.695
In this case,
we know it's true.

02:22.729 --> 02:25.064
Bob, you're getting
a nickname! Fun!

02:25.065 --> 02:26.999
Mr. Belt-Stretcher.
Ha!

02:27.033 --> 02:28.167
Mr. Bowel-Chair.

02:28.201 --> 02:30.035
No, Dr. Fart!

02:30.036 --> 02:31.837
Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III.

02:31.871 --> 02:34.106
Those are kind of
all not very good.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.141
Hmm, Bowel-Chair, pretty good.
All right, let's go to school.

02:36.142 --> 02:37.977
Let me try a squirt
of that pepper spray.

02:40.046 --> 02:42.314
Oh, actually,
not so bad.

02:42.315 --> 02:44.016
<i>Aw, what's the matter, Teddy?</i>

02:44.050 --> 02:45.484
You're actually chewing
your food instead of

02:45.485 --> 02:47.219
throwing your head back
like a duck.

02:47.220 --> 02:49.154
I got to go to my cousin's
wedding this weekend

02:49.155 --> 02:50.556
and I'm dreading it.
Oh.

02:50.557 --> 02:52.725
Is this the cousin you got
to second base with?

02:52.726 --> 02:55.694
No, that was my second cousin and
it was third base. What is it then?

02:55.729 --> 02:58.364
There's always dancing
at weddings, and I can't dance.

02:58.398 --> 03:01.200
You know, Teddy, I could teach
you how to dance. I taught myself,

03:01.234 --> 03:05.070
and look at me. That is impressive.

03:05.105 --> 03:07.773
Right? I don't know. I mean,
the wedding's in three days.

03:07.774 --> 03:09.942
That's plenty of time.
It's maybe's too much time.

03:09.943 --> 03:12.111
Can they move it up?
 I don't think so.

03:12.112 --> 03:14.113
They already rented a bounce house.
Bounce house?

03:14.114 --> 03:15.848
Yeah, pretty shi-shi.

03:17.450 --> 03:19.451
Hello, class.

03:19.452 --> 03:21.868
I'm, uh, Mr. Belcher,
your substitute.

03:21.888 --> 03:24.056
I will be teaching you,
but I also look forward

03:24.057 --> 03:26.659
to each one of you... whoa...
teaching me.

03:26.693 --> 03:28.160
Nice purse, Mr. B.!

03:28.194 --> 03:29.674
It's a... it's a briefcase.

03:29.696 --> 03:31.897
Man purse!
No, it's not a man purse.

03:31.898 --> 03:34.099
Purse! Anyway,
what have you guys covered so far?

03:34.100 --> 03:37.202
Pies? Omelets? Maybe
you've tackled a casserole?

03:37.237 --> 03:39.238
One time we made popsicles
out of juice.

03:39.239 --> 03:40.973
And then we made juice
by melting popsicles.

03:40.974 --> 03:42.708
Oh, wait, that was
in science.

03:42.742 --> 03:45.644
We don't cook in Home Ec.
We watch educational movies.

03:45.645 --> 03:48.147
And I do funny commentary.
Zeke's really funny.

03:48.148 --> 03:50.449
'Prec.
So put in a flick Mr. B.

03:50.483 --> 03:53.252
No, no, no. Today, why don't
we actually do a little cooking?

03:53.286 --> 03:55.287
Cooking's stupid!
The only cooking I do

03:55.288 --> 03:57.456
is an Indian burn!
 Ah! Zeke, it burns!

03:57.457 --> 03:59.258
Gotcha!
I'm gonna go get your neck! Zeke!

03:59.292 --> 04:00.225
Zeke, let him go.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.393
Play the movie!

04:01.394 --> 04:04.630
Movie! Movie! Movie!

04:04.664 --> 04:07.066
Movie! Movie! Movie!
Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III!

04:07.067 --> 04:08.066
Dr. Fart!

04:08.068 --> 04:10.169
Alphonso Poo Poo Fatty III!

04:12.605 --> 04:15.841
I have pepper spray in my purse,
and I will use it!

04:17.108 --> 04:20.346
Movies! Movies! Movies! Movies!

04:20.382 --> 04:22.449
You're animals!
You're all animals!

04:22.450 --> 04:24.285
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on in here?

04:24.286 --> 04:25.419
Calm down, children.

04:25.453 --> 04:28.088
Here's your movie.

04:28.123 --> 04:29.556
♪ I'm here
to teach you Home Ec ♪

04:29.557 --> 04:31.058
♪ It'll only take a sec

04:31.092 --> 04:32.326
Nothing to make fun of yet.

04:32.327 --> 04:33.961
I'm really
enjoying it so far.

04:33.995 --> 04:35.129
Kids are horrible.

04:35.130 --> 04:36.430
Why do we keep making them?

04:36.431 --> 04:38.599
Do you need a hug?
No. Kind of. No.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.767
All ght, Bob,
I should have explained.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.969
Home Ec isn't
for honor students.

04:41.970 --> 04:44.071
It's where dumb-dumbs
learn to make ice.

04:44.072 --> 04:45.906
You know my daughter's
in that class, right?

04:45.907 --> 04:47.041
Yes, Bob, I do.

04:47.075 --> 04:48.275
Okay, but shouldn't we be...

04:48.310 --> 04:49.410
challenging these kids?

04:49.444 --> 04:50.678
What? Like a fight?

04:50.679 --> 04:52.079
I don't want to fight
those kids.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.914
Maybe the girls, but...
No, teaching them.

04:53.915 --> 04:55.249
Teaching them how to cook.

04:55.283 --> 04:57.284
Bob, the movies mellow them out.

04:57.285 --> 04:59.853
It's not like
we can slip meds into their milk.

04:59.854 --> 05:02.423
Anymore.
What?

05:02.424 --> 05:04.825
Hmm? I got to go. I g-got lots to
do. Wait. Di... But I'm not go...

05:04.826 --> 05:07.182
- I don't want to go back in there.
- Frond...

05:07.195 --> 05:08.729
<i>So, what's the easiest step?</i>

05:08.763 --> 05:10.130
No steps. If I wanted
to see steps,

05:10.131 --> 05:11.932
I'd go to a staircase.
Right.

05:11.933 --> 05:14.535
Everyone's a dancer. You're
probably dancing all day long,

05:14.536 --> 05:16.971
you don't even know it. There!
You just tugged up your pants

05:16.972 --> 05:19.406
to cover up your butt crack.
Now, that could be a move.

05:19.441 --> 05:21.275
Okay, tug and wiggle,
tug and wiggle. Right?

05:21.276 --> 05:22.743
Tug and wiggle,
tug and wiggle.

05:22.777 --> 05:24.678
Now let's make
your boom-boom jiggle. Come on.

05:27.782 --> 05:29.817
There he is.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.319
Look at you.
Bill Cosby's got nothing on me.

05:32.354 --> 05:34.021
Hey, guys.
Hey, how was Home Ec?

05:34.022 --> 05:35.856
- Keep it goin', Teddy.
- It was fun.

05:35.890 --> 05:37.891
Mr. Belcher totally
lost control of the class.

05:37.892 --> 05:39.259
Dad did great.

05:39.294 --> 05:40.461
He broke down
and cried quicker

05:40.462 --> 05:41.996
than any
substitute teacher ever.

05:41.997 --> 05:43.430
I didn't cry.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.466
Well, the rumor
that I started says otherwise.

05:45.467 --> 05:47.468
I started a rumor
you wear diapers.

05:47.469 --> 05:49.036
But so far,
no traction.

05:49.037 --> 05:50.537
No, I heard that.
Yes!

05:50.538 --> 05:51.972
Nah, just quit, Bob.

05:51.973 --> 05:53.474
You always have
a job at Bob's Burgers.

05:53.475 --> 05:55.209
Yeah, that'll cheer him up.

05:55.243 --> 05:57.478
No. You know what. I'm not
gonna quit on those kids.

05:57.479 --> 05:59.567
I just have to find
a way to reach them.

05:59.581 --> 06:01.682
Should I still be
dancing? I'm having chest pains.

06:01.683 --> 06:03.250
Keep goin'!

06:03.251 --> 06:04.618
<i>Sorry I was all up</i>

06:04.652 --> 06:06.286
in your grill about

06:06.321 --> 06:08.288
cooking yesterday.

06:08.323 --> 06:09.857
Don't try
to be our friend.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.392
Um, all right,
well, let's fire up

06:11.393 --> 06:12.826
<i>Chester the Home Ec-ster</i>

06:12.827 --> 06:14.795
<i>Meets Dustin
the Dusting Cowboy.</i>

06:14.829 --> 06:16.530
Those two are always
gettin' into it.

06:16.564 --> 06:18.565
Oh, anybody want
some microwave popcorn

06:18.566 --> 06:19.900
to go with the movie?

06:19.901 --> 06:21.869
Whoops, I ripped the bag.

06:21.903 --> 06:25.005
Now we can't
have popcorn! Idiot.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.475
Hey, everybody, maybe there's
<i>another</i> way to make popcorn.

06:28.510 --> 06:30.511
He's trying to microwave
without a microwave.

06:30.512 --> 06:32.513
Mr. B.'s lost it.
God, he's lost it!

06:32.514 --> 06:34.014
Let's see where
he goes with this.

06:34.015 --> 06:36.016
Oh, my God!
What's happening?!

06:36.051 --> 06:38.485
We're cooking, Jocelyn.
That's what's happening.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.088
What's cooking?
Aw, poop, he tricked us!

06:41.089 --> 06:43.257
Or, aw, poop,
he <i>taught</i> us.

06:43.258 --> 06:45.426
It smells like real
microwave popcorn.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.294
Hey, who wants to make
some <i>kettle</i> corn?

06:47.295 --> 06:48.896
Me! Me! I do.

06:48.897 --> 06:50.697
You rock,
Mr. Belcher.

06:50.732 --> 06:52.633
All right, Anthony.
Down low, too slow.

06:52.634 --> 06:54.068
Oh. You got there in time.

06:54.102 --> 06:55.936
Come on. There's a line?

06:55.970 --> 06:57.704
That was a great class,
Mr. Belcher.

06:57.705 --> 07:00.274
Calm down, kiddo. Sorry,
Zeke, I just got carried away.

07:00.275 --> 07:02.709
Nah, we're cool and all
but just shut up sometimes.

07:02.710 --> 07:05.245
Right. Got it.
Shut it! Jimmy Jr., shut it!

07:05.280 --> 07:06.914
Your dad's really cool.

07:06.915 --> 07:09.249
He's married!
To a friend of mine!

07:09.250 --> 07:10.984
What the heck happened here?

07:10.985 --> 07:13.787
I'm not sure. I think Dad
might be a great teacher.

07:13.788 --> 07:17.057
Your dad rules! Hey, I don't
appreciate your lack of sarcasm.

07:17.058 --> 07:19.726
There's a lot of
competition for teacher's pet.

07:19.727 --> 07:21.528
It's a real petting
zoo in there.

07:21.563 --> 07:23.323
<i>And shake it
and shake it and shake it</i>

07:23.331 --> 07:25.599
and shake it and...
Aw, stop shakin' it.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.468
Whew.
Teddy, I'm gonna be frank, okay?

07:27.502 --> 07:29.603
You got the moves
but there's no fire.

07:29.604 --> 07:32.005
I got no fire!
No, it's okay

07:32.006 --> 07:33.907
because weddings
have <i>firewater.</i>

07:33.908 --> 07:35.309
Firewater?
Yes.

07:35.310 --> 07:37.077
What is firewater?
It's alcohol.

07:37.078 --> 07:39.079
Right. Okay. It's been
helpin' men dance at weddings

07:39.080 --> 07:40.681
since the beginning
of time. Come on.

07:40.682 --> 07:42.316
You chug-a-lug
and cut a rug!

07:42.317 --> 07:44.751
Well, I got to fix a roof
later but this is important.

07:44.752 --> 07:46.587
Attaboy!

07:46.588 --> 07:48.956
Will not be the first time
I've fallen off a roof.

07:50.091 --> 07:51.425
Hi, I was wondering

07:51.426 --> 07:52.826
if I could
borrow an egg?

07:52.827 --> 07:54.962
I'm Bob, the substitute
Home Ec teacher.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.998
Well, well, well, Mr. Bob
the substitute Home Ec teacher

07:57.999 --> 08:00.834
comes into my kitchen
and wants to borrow a egg.

08:00.869 --> 08:02.870
If you don't have one, it's fine.
No, let's get you that egg.

08:02.871 --> 08:04.605
Oh, thank you.
Here it is.

08:04.639 --> 08:07.508
That's not an egg.
That's your middle finger.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.610
If you don't want it
sunny-side up, I can make it

08:09.644 --> 08:11.378
over easy.
Finger upside down, got it.

08:11.379 --> 08:12.913
Want to see scrambled?

08:12.947 --> 08:14.548
Jeez, it's a little
aggressive down here.

08:14.549 --> 08:15.883
I mean,
aren't we on the same team?

08:15.884 --> 08:17.317
We both work for the school.

08:17.352 --> 08:19.786
I don't. I work
for Caf-Co Food Services.

08:19.787 --> 08:24.057
And Caf-Co has a strict policy
against lending eggs to Bob.

08:24.058 --> 08:26.160
All right, well, I'll find an
egg someplace else, I guess.

08:26.161 --> 08:29.897
Just messing with you.

08:29.898 --> 08:31.999
Seriously, I've got a dozen
over here on the shelf.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.304
Jeez, you really had
I know.

08:34.335 --> 08:37.304
Fu... That's funny.
Here you go. Here you go.

08:37.337 --> 08:39.273
Uh, I got it.
Here you go. Here you go.

08:39.307 --> 08:41.607
You got a basket for these? Huh?
Yeah, no... I'm all set, thank...

08:41.643 --> 08:43.962
Thank you. Thanks for your help.
All right. Take care, Bob.

08:43.977 --> 08:45.979
Have a nice day. Yeah, you, too.
Can you believe that guy?

08:45.980 --> 08:47.814
Substitute.

08:47.815 --> 08:50.150
Okay, someone taste this soup
and tell me what it needs.

08:50.151 --> 08:52.619
Oh, look, he chose me.
Okay, fine, I'll do it.

08:52.654 --> 08:54.221
Um... salt.

08:54.222 --> 08:56.156
I know that because I pay
attention in class,

08:56.157 --> 08:57.357
and I'm not texting like Jocelyn

08:57.392 --> 08:58.792
or late like Peter.

08:58.826 --> 09:00.727
Uh, someone else?
Zeke, you want to try?

09:00.762 --> 09:02.362
I don't need
this stuff, Mr. B.

09:02.363 --> 09:04.198
I ain't goin' to college.
Just try it, Zeke.

09:04.199 --> 09:05.532
Nope! I can't do it.
Well, no...

09:05.567 --> 09:06.433
Zeke.
No!

09:06.434 --> 09:07.568
No one will laugh at you.

09:07.602 --> 09:09.336
All right. Might as well try

09:09.370 --> 09:11.772
to Zeke it up, I guess.

09:11.773 --> 09:14.274
Let's see what we got.
All right.

09:14.275 --> 09:16.510
Uh, let's try some
of this leafy stuff.

09:16.544 --> 09:18.712
Some of these orange flakes
that look like fish food.

09:18.746 --> 09:21.081
Forget it, forget it.

09:21.115 --> 09:23.050
Let's invite some
of thisto the party!

09:23.051 --> 09:24.785
Ooh, la, la.

09:24.786 --> 09:26.620
Paprika? Eureka!

09:26.621 --> 09:28.589
Get your ass in here, girl!

09:28.623 --> 09:31.858
Oh, man.  Oh, boy.

09:31.859 --> 09:34.027
All right, I
probably wrecked it.

09:34.062 --> 09:36.496
It's... unbelievable.

09:36.531 --> 09:38.198
Shut up.
It's amazing.

09:38.199 --> 09:40.200
No. Zeke,
you may have a perfect palate.

09:40.201 --> 09:41.401
Do you know how rare that is?

09:41.436 --> 09:43.437
Get out of my mouth,
Mr. B.! Stop it!

09:43.438 --> 09:45.872
Zeke, you can't run away
from your gift! No! No! No!

09:45.873 --> 09:48.542
I can teach you! Zeke, don't shut
me out!

09:48.543 --> 09:50.744
You've got to... You've got give it
a... Shut up! Shut up! Go to hell!

09:50.745 --> 09:53.551
You've got to give it a chance,
Zeke! Go to hell!

09:53.581 --> 09:55.983
All right, I'll try it.

09:55.984 --> 09:58.852
Just don't start something
you can't finish, Mr. B.

09:58.886 --> 10:01.188
I won't let you down, Zeke.

10:01.222 --> 10:02.956
Anyhow, the soup
wasn't perfect.

10:02.957 --> 10:04.591
Tina put too
much salt in it.

10:04.626 --> 10:06.126
Go to hell, Zeke.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.862
♪ La, la

10:08.896 --> 10:11.265
♪ La, la, la, la, la

10:12.400 --> 10:15.002
♪ La, la, la,
la, la ♪

10:15.003 --> 10:17.004
♪ La, la

10:17.005 --> 10:19.740
♪ La, la, la, la, la.

10:19.774 --> 10:22.476
Smells great.
Yeah, we should eat it right now.

10:22.510 --> 10:23.777
Hey, you guys aren't
in this class.

10:23.811 --> 10:25.312
Please?
It smells so good.

10:25.313 --> 10:27.247
We'll pay.
With our lunch money.

10:27.248 --> 10:29.249
You guys, we're not
a restaurant. Go away.

10:29.284 --> 10:31.451
Well, wait, we could be.
No, we're not.

10:31.452 --> 10:33.453
Well, that's the "Ec"
of "Home Ec."

10:33.454 --> 10:35.155
A-a restaurant.
Oh.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.990
Yeah, a Home Ec-staurant.

10:36.991 --> 10:39.192
Jocelyn, you can do your salads.
Yay, salad!

10:39.193 --> 10:41.995
Peter, you can be our beverage guy.
What's a beverage?

10:42.030 --> 10:43.764
Jimmy Jr.,
can you handle the money?

10:43.798 --> 10:45.999
I have a calculator.
You do the math.

10:46.034 --> 10:47.634
And for our head chef,

10:47.635 --> 10:51.071
the person who will
wield the spatula... Tina?

10:51.105 --> 10:52.806
Yes?
Can you hand this to Zeke?

10:52.840 --> 10:54.841
Hell, yes!

10:54.842 --> 10:56.843
Tina, give it to him.

10:56.844 --> 10:57.744
Come on, let go.

10:57.779 --> 10:59.413
Tina, give him the spatula.

10:59.447 --> 11:00.647
Let go, Tina.

11:00.682 --> 11:02.115
Let go of it, Tina!

11:02.116 --> 11:03.550
We want to eat!
Let go of it, Tina.

11:03.551 --> 11:05.619
Give it to Zeke.
Give it to Zeke. Tina!

11:05.653 --> 11:08.188
Where are all
the food holes?

11:08.189 --> 11:09.790
Huh?
The rest of the kids.

11:09.791 --> 11:11.391
Maybe they're
at the Home Ec-staurant?

11:11.392 --> 11:12.826
The Home Ec-sta
<i>what?!</i> Back up!

11:12.827 --> 11:14.328
Home Ec-staurant.
Home Ec-sta <i>what?!</i>

11:14.329 --> 11:15.829
Aah! I can't breathe.
Home Ec-sta <i>what?!</i>

11:15.830 --> 11:18.165
Can't breathe! Aah!
You're useless! Useless!

11:18.166 --> 11:20.167
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hildy's sorry.

11:20.168 --> 11:22.436
Here, take an extra, uh,
black and white bar.

11:23.905 --> 11:25.706
Yeah, we got a problem.

11:25.740 --> 11:27.645
No, it's Hildy.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.702
Look at us, we're packed.

11:30.703 --> 11:33.371
Yeah, we're busier than a monkey
with six dingalings! Order up!

11:33.372 --> 11:35.907
Come on, Jocelyn,
get your head out of your butt! Oh.

11:35.941 --> 11:37.909
How am I doing on
dishwashing, Mr. Belcher?

11:37.943 --> 11:39.711
Good, Tina. Of course, kids are
licking the plates clean,

11:39.712 --> 11:42.146
so it's kind of easy, right? No.

11:42.147 --> 11:44.115
Yeah, if we're gonna keep up,
we need more manpower.

11:44.116 --> 11:46.117
No, no, no, no, no!
No! no...

11:46.118 --> 11:47.652
You don't want me.
I'm a terrible employee!

11:47.653 --> 11:49.120
Check my references!

11:49.121 --> 11:50.488
And Gene's the one
who trained me.

11:50.489 --> 11:52.190
I didn't even listen.

11:52.191 --> 11:54.125
Gene, you're a waiter,
Louise, you're hostess.

11:54.126 --> 11:56.761
We need to turn some tables! Fine!

11:56.795 --> 11:58.362
Hello. How was everything?

11:58.363 --> 11:59.731
Guess you didn't like it!

11:59.732 --> 12:01.399
Ha, ha, just kidding.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.634
So unless there's anything else,
maybe you should go now.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.303
Ga-up, up, up,
up, up, up.

12:05.304 --> 12:07.138
Drive safe. Thanks for coming.
Come again.

12:07.139 --> 12:08.673
I got an open two-top here!

12:08.707 --> 12:11.342
Give me a bald Kelly Ripa
and a canoe with a brick!

12:11.343 --> 12:13.511
Chicken taco, no sour cream,
plus a brownie... you got it.

12:13.512 --> 12:15.713
Really? <i>I</i> didn't even
know what I meant.

12:15.748 --> 12:17.215
I think I'm a
great waiter!

12:17.216 --> 12:18.683
I think
I'm a great hostess!

12:18.684 --> 12:20.351
Maybe we've
always been great.

12:20.352 --> 12:22.553
Yeah! And we've just been
working in a sucky restaurant.

12:23.889 --> 12:26.824
I guess I know where I belong.

12:26.825 --> 12:29.794
Hi. I want to transfer
into Metal Shop.

12:29.828 --> 12:31.329
Come in.

12:31.363 --> 12:32.930
<i>Part of dancing</i>

12:32.965 --> 12:34.565
is finding a partner, okay?

12:34.566 --> 12:36.467
So go ask that guy to dance. Um...

12:36.468 --> 12:37.835
Do it.
What if says no?

12:37.836 --> 12:39.237
Make him say yes
with your body.

12:39.238 --> 12:40.705
With my body, right.

12:40.706 --> 12:42.106
Right, yeah.

12:42.141 --> 12:43.741
No, I don't
want to dance.

12:43.742 --> 12:45.243
What about now?

12:46.745 --> 12:48.813
Okay.

12:48.847 --> 12:52.517
Hey, Bob, I made this guy
say yes with my body. Great.

12:52.518 --> 12:54.485
Enjoying yourself, sir?
Yeah, this is all right.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.887
Hey, you're home
from school early.

12:55.888 --> 12:57.755
Well, I'm going back.

12:57.756 --> 12:59.357
I'm just grabbing some plates
for the second restaurant.

12:59.358 --> 13:00.925
What second restaurant?
The home ec class.

13:00.926 --> 13:02.426
Now it's a home
ec-staurant.

13:02.427 --> 13:04.695
Lin, this teaching
thing is unbelievable.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.097
I'm changing kids' lives!

13:06.098 --> 13:07.532
Me, too! I feel
exactly the same!

13:07.533 --> 13:09.033
I changed Teddy's life!

13:09.067 --> 13:11.369
Um, uh, I don't know if we're

13:11.370 --> 13:13.037
feeling quite the
same thing, Lin.

13:13.038 --> 13:14.739
I mean Teddy's one
life, and he's old.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.140
Not that it's
a competition.

13:16.141 --> 13:17.942
No, of course not,
but, uh...

13:17.943 --> 13:19.443
I bet none of your students
can do this.

13:19.444 --> 13:20.778
Come on, lift that guy up.
Lift him up.

13:20.813 --> 13:22.947
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:22.981 --> 13:24.415
See that?

13:24.416 --> 13:25.917
I got him up!
He's up.

13:25.918 --> 13:27.485
I'm gonna spin! Light!
Light! Light! Light!

13:27.486 --> 13:29.620
Kevin, are those new pants?

13:29.621 --> 13:31.289
Cindy, Ray,
are you two back together?

13:31.290 --> 13:32.790
So happy.

13:32.791 --> 13:34.458
Hey, Paul,
when's the cast coming off?

13:34.459 --> 13:36.828
Stop using those crutches
as a crutch.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.963
David, come here. Sorry about
your parents' divorce.

13:38.964 --> 13:40.731
It's not your fault.
I love you, man.

13:40.732 --> 13:43.301
Donald, the rat tail...
it's coming back!

13:43.302 --> 13:44.635
Okay, I'm going
to the bathroom now.

13:44.636 --> 13:46.070
I'm going to stop talking.

13:47.472 --> 13:48.953
Aah!

13:48.974 --> 13:50.408
I didn't mean
to startle you.

13:50.409 --> 13:52.143
Just wanted to check in
with the new lunch lady.

13:52.144 --> 13:53.744
I-I'm not a
lunch lady.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.247
You sell lunches to kids,
you got a little mustache.

13:56.281 --> 13:58.316
Occupied!

13:58.350 --> 14:00.418
Well, I-I should probably
get back to my classroom.

14:00.419 --> 14:01.853
Not so fast.

14:01.854 --> 14:03.421
Wash your hands.
That's disgusting.

14:03.422 --> 14:05.990
Oh, yeah, you kind of
threw me off my routine.

14:05.991 --> 14:07.792
Wash up.
I prefer to do it myself.

14:07.826 --> 14:09.260
You got to get
in there.

14:09.261 --> 14:10.828
Can you not wash my hands?

14:10.829 --> 14:12.496
Hotter water. I got to get
hotter water on this.

14:12.497 --> 14:14.632
You're hurting me.
That's really hot.

14:14.633 --> 14:17.935
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!

14:17.970 --> 14:19.370
Oh, God... Ah.

14:19.371 --> 14:20.771
Now that you're all
cleaned up,

14:20.772 --> 14:22.373
there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

14:24.643 --> 14:27.078
Get in the back.

14:27.112 --> 14:27.945
"Get in the back"?

14:27.946 --> 14:29.347
Lift the thing

14:29.348 --> 14:31.115
on the side,
the seat slides forward.

14:31.149 --> 14:33.284
Crawl under the seat
belt. I'll hold it up.

14:33.285 --> 14:34.952
Okay, um...

14:34.953 --> 14:36.787
Hello. I'm Mr. Platt.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.456
"Michael Mauermann."

14:38.457 --> 14:39.991
Mr. Mauermann retired.

14:39.992 --> 14:41.459
My cards aren't
ready yet.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.294
Trust me, they'll
look quite similar.

14:43.295 --> 14:45.062
"Caf-Co Food Services."

14:45.063 --> 14:46.898
Bob, we have an
exclusive contract

14:46.899 --> 14:48.966
that you are in
violation thereof.

14:48.967 --> 14:51.369
Come on, your big corporation
has a problem

14:51.370 --> 14:53.070
with kids making food
for other kids?

14:53.071 --> 14:54.872
Definitely.

14:54.907 --> 14:57.541
If it's bigger than a bake sale,
they call Michael Mauermann,

14:57.542 --> 14:59.977
and they reach me because
I have his number now,

14:59.978 --> 15:01.545
and I shut it down.

15:01.580 --> 15:04.515
Well, I was hired by Mr. Frond,
so, take it up with him.

15:04.549 --> 15:06.651
Oh. I already have.

15:06.685 --> 15:08.252
Sorry I'm late.

15:08.253 --> 15:09.887
I thought we were meeting
in that hatchback over there.

15:09.888 --> 15:11.355
Hmm. Bob, could you please...?

15:11.356 --> 15:12.723
Make a little room.
Could you...?

15:12.724 --> 15:14.592
Yeah. Yup. Yes.

15:14.593 --> 15:16.027
And I'm not gonna sit on the hump!
Can you be polite, Bob?

15:16.028 --> 15:17.595
Just move over.
Thank you. Thank you.

15:17.596 --> 15:19.030
Well, I don't want
to sit on your lap, so...

15:19.031 --> 15:20.431
Uh... I don't want you to, either.

15:20.432 --> 15:21.933
Bob, the administration
is siding with Caf-Co.

15:21.934 --> 15:23.501
You are to close
the Home Ec-staurant,

15:23.502 --> 15:25.403
and go back to movies,
or you're fired.

15:25.437 --> 15:27.371
No. I-I won't do it to the kids.

15:27.406 --> 15:30.841
Then out you go!
 What are you doing?

15:30.842 --> 15:33.711
Open the door so I can push him
out, Mr. Frond. Can you not do that?

15:33.745 --> 15:35.713
I mean, I can just curl up in
the seat here and let him go by.

15:35.747 --> 15:37.214
Well, if you would shimmy
forward, now, now...

15:37.215 --> 15:39.016
You know, all you need
to do is move.

15:39.017 --> 15:40.718
You're pushing my neck.
I-I want to push you out.

15:40.719 --> 15:42.553
You're... Stop pushing me.
I'll just get out.

15:42.554 --> 15:44.588
And here it comes.
Got you. Ha, ha!

15:44.623 --> 15:46.223
No, you didn't.
Well, yes, I did.

15:46.224 --> 15:47.725
I pushed you out,
and you're fired.

15:47.726 --> 15:49.560
So, double burn on you.
I got out on my own.

15:49.561 --> 15:51.095
Well, then, uh...
you're rehired.

15:51.096 --> 15:53.130
Get back in the car.
No. I'm not falling for that.

15:53.131 --> 15:54.865
No, just... just sit down
on the edge of the seat here.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.175
No, I'm walking away now.
Thank you. You...

16:00.172 --> 16:01.606
Now you.

16:01.607 --> 16:03.007
Not bad, Lin,
but what about...

16:03.008 --> 16:05.176
♪ Baba, bada, ba-ba,
ba-bada-bup. ♪

16:05.177 --> 16:07.478
Yeah, that's okay, Teddy,

16:07.479 --> 16:09.981
and thisand that
and thatand that!

16:09.982 --> 16:11.582
Maybe you were
thinking of <i>this!</i>

16:11.583 --> 16:13.084
Ooh, ah, ooh-ooh, ah!

16:13.085 --> 16:14.852
Ow, my face!
Oh, my God, Lin!

16:14.853 --> 16:17.088
Aah!

16:17.122 --> 16:18.689
This was a bad idea.

16:18.690 --> 16:20.224
I should never dance.
<i>I should never dance!</i>

16:20.259 --> 16:22.627
No, Teddy. This is what
dancing's all about.

16:22.628 --> 16:24.629
Not holding back,
taking chances!

16:24.630 --> 16:26.998
Yeah, sometimes people get hit
in the mouth. So what?

16:27.032 --> 16:28.432
You're not...
you're not mad?

16:28.433 --> 16:31.002
Mad? Teddy,
I'm as proud as can be.

16:31.003 --> 16:32.503
I got nothing more
to teach you.

16:32.504 --> 16:34.772
The only thing left
to do now is... Kiss?

16:34.773 --> 16:36.674
No! What? No! Dance.

16:36.675 --> 16:38.109
Dance out that door.

16:38.110 --> 16:39.477
It's your graduation.

16:58.063 --> 17:00.186
I, uh... I just
need to get a couple things.

17:00.199 --> 17:01.632
It's Mr. B!

17:01.633 --> 17:03.501
Save us, please!

17:03.502 --> 17:05.770
We don't want to watch movies,
Mr. Belcher! We want you!

17:05.804 --> 17:08.402
Yeah, we want to, like,
cook stuff! We miss you.

17:08.406 --> 17:09.840
Look, kids, I'm sorry.

17:09.842 --> 17:11.142
This-this wasn't
my idea. I...

17:11.175 --> 17:12.577
Come on, Mr. Belcher,
you got to stay.

17:12.578 --> 17:14.241
Come on!
Okay, okay, okay.

17:14.246 --> 17:15.713
Okay, okay, okay,
children, children.

17:15.714 --> 17:19.784
Okay, everyone, hush.
Watch the movie.

17:19.818 --> 17:22.086
Wait.

17:24.388 --> 17:27.358
Mr. B.

17:29.494 --> 17:31.362
Stop it!

17:31.363 --> 17:33.798
That's a huge waste
of popcorn.

17:38.370 --> 17:39.937
Get out, Bob!

17:39.938 --> 17:41.973
Caf-Co won. You're done.

17:42.007 --> 17:44.480
Meat is done, not people!

17:44.509 --> 17:46.677
I just felt a little tingly
there when you said that.

17:46.712 --> 17:50.214
Listen, we can't win this war,
but maybe we can go out cooking.

17:50.215 --> 17:52.550
What if we serve this school
one more lunch?

17:52.584 --> 17:54.518
The Home Ec-staurant
is closed!

17:54.553 --> 17:58.327
Everyone's already down in
the cafeteria anyway. It's over.

17:58.357 --> 18:00.691
Yeah, they are,
so we go to them.

18:04.229 --> 18:07.765
Let's get this chow-wagon
rollin' to Mouth Town, everyone!

18:07.766 --> 18:09.767
I'm telling
Mr. Platt.

18:09.801 --> 18:12.370
What do we make, Mr. Belcher?
Burgers!

18:12.371 --> 18:13.604
Burgers, really?

18:13.639 --> 18:15.539
Wait. That...
We don't want burgers?

18:15.574 --> 18:17.074
No! No, no, no!
That's good. That's fine.

18:17.109 --> 18:18.776
I thought burg...
Okay, well, we could...

18:18.777 --> 18:20.444
No, sounds like you're
married to burgers, so...

18:20.445 --> 18:22.435
Burgers! Thought I heard
"braised lamb shank" is all.

18:22.447 --> 18:24.949
Great, after I bought
all those gift certificates!

18:24.983 --> 18:26.450
Well, I can't go back
to my old job.

18:26.451 --> 18:28.119
I burned a lot
of bridges there!

18:28.120 --> 18:30.955
To the cafeteria!
Gene, Louise, hop on!

18:30.956 --> 18:32.323
- Okay.
- All right.

18:32.324 --> 18:33.724
It's the mobile
Home Ec-staurant.

18:33.759 --> 18:35.927
Tina, how are we fixed
on dishes?

18:35.928 --> 18:37.461
Tina? Where's Tina?

18:37.462 --> 18:39.297
She transferred
to Metal Shop,

18:39.298 --> 18:41.432
because her home ec teacher was
treating her like day-old bread.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.134
Tina transferred?

18:43.135 --> 18:44.835
Oh, my God, I-I didn't even
realize she was gone.

18:44.836 --> 18:47.204
Wait. Everybody stop.
Which way is Metal Shop?

18:48.740 --> 18:50.975
Look, I welded a piece of metal
to a piece of metal.

18:50.976 --> 18:52.376
Hi. I'm Tina.

18:52.411 --> 18:53.244
Tina!

18:53.245 --> 18:54.245
Hello, Mr. Belcher.

18:54.279 --> 18:55.413
What are you doing here?

18:55.447 --> 18:57.081
Really cool things with metal.

18:57.082 --> 18:58.471
At least I'm teacher's pet
<i>somewhere.</i>

18:58.483 --> 19:00.284
No, that's Jeremy. Oh.

19:00.285 --> 19:02.987
Tina, I'm sorry I didn't pay
enough attention to you.

19:03.021 --> 19:04.488
I-I've never taught
a class before.

19:04.489 --> 19:06.157
I didn't know how
to treat my own kid.

19:06.191 --> 19:08.926
I wanted to be your
favorite student, not Zeke.

19:08.961 --> 19:11.696
But you're already
my favorite... eldest daughter.

19:11.697 --> 19:13.319
I can't do
anything right!

19:13.332 --> 19:14.966
Come with us, Tina.

19:14.967 --> 19:16.767
We're gonna serve
one last lunch, and we need you.

19:16.802 --> 19:17.835
To wash dishes?

19:17.869 --> 19:19.537
Yes! But you can
also do prep.

19:19.538 --> 19:20.938
Okay.

19:20.973 --> 19:22.340
Bye, everyone.

19:22.341 --> 19:23.808
Bye, Jeremy.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.180
There they are.

19:29.214 --> 19:30.815
Nice try, Bob,

19:30.816 --> 19:33.317
but your little food cart
escapade is <i>over.</i>

19:33.352 --> 19:34.785
Don't listen to him, kids.

19:34.786 --> 19:36.020
Keep pushing.
We need speed.

19:36.021 --> 19:37.388
Gene, get off.

19:37.389 --> 19:38.990
I just got
comfortable.

19:38.991 --> 19:40.846
Get off your cushion,
and do some pushin'!

19:40.859 --> 19:42.193
Stop!

19:42.227 --> 19:43.961
Ramming speed!

19:43.996 --> 19:46.602
Oh, goodness, I am
jumping out of the way. Aah!

19:47.632 --> 19:49.700
Oh, God,
it's collapsing.

19:49.735 --> 19:53.359
I have something
we can use... metal.

19:55.307 --> 19:57.488
The Home Ec-staurant
is back in business.

19:57.509 --> 20:00.111
Come and get it, Wagstaff!

20:00.145 --> 20:03.848
(cheering and whoopi

20:03.882 --> 20:05.316
We got burgers!

20:05.317 --> 20:06.817
And tomatoes and onions
that I chopped,

20:06.818 --> 20:08.586
because I'm in charge of prep.

20:08.587 --> 20:10.488
Joceyln's doing it, too,
but I'm more in charge than her.

20:10.489 --> 20:12.023
No, you're not.
Yeah, he said that I was.

20:12.024 --> 20:13.324
No. No,

20:13.358 --> 20:14.792
don't eat that!
Eat <i>that!</i>

20:14.826 --> 20:16.227
We need that money!
You... <i>You,</i> stop chewing!

20:16.228 --> 20:18.029
Hildy, get that food
out of his mouth!

20:18.030 --> 20:20.698
All of you,
eat the cafeteria lunch!

20:20.699 --> 20:22.366
Ah... forget it.

20:22.367 --> 20:24.235
Hildy, let's go
get drunk.

20:24.236 --> 20:26.037
What do you mean,
<i>"Get</i> drunk"?

20:26.038 --> 20:28.039
Yay! We did
it, Mr. B!

20:28.040 --> 20:30.775
This will always be remembered,
till people forget.

20:30.776 --> 20:33.077
By the way, you guys are
all getting an A.

20:33.078 --> 20:34.512
Oh, yeah!
Yeahh

20:34.513 --> 20:36.414
Except for Tina.
Yay...! Oh.

20:36.415 --> 20:38.749
A plus.
Thanks, Mr. Belcher.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.051
It's a pass-fail class.

20:40.085 --> 20:41.952
Oh, okay. Uh, pass plus.

20:41.953 --> 20:44.422
Hey, you want to take a break
and get something to eat?

20:44.456 --> 20:47.091
Belcher party of two, your
server will be right with you.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.626
Hi. How's, uh,
everybody's day so far?

20:48.627 --> 20:50.528
Getting better.
Fantastic.

20:50.529 --> 20:52.596
I'll be back with some waters
and tell you about our specials.

20:52.597 --> 20:55.032
I could really use someone like
him back at the restaurant.

Kids, kids, kids, you can't go

Someone threw up in there.
