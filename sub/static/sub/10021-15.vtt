00:12.362 --> 00:15.058
Mom! Dad!

00:15.365 --> 00:18.027
Mom! Dad!

00:26.042 --> 00:29.068
Worst kids are up front.
Coming home from a ski trip.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.179
Three of them were trapped
under the plow.

00:31.381 --> 00:33.747
Patient three: 10-year-old
with head trauma.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.578
Blown pupil, altered mental status,
left leg pinned.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.084
Pressure's 110 palp. Rate's 32.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.622
Tube, hyperventilate her. Notify
County, intracranial bleed.

00:42.826 --> 00:45.386
Have Neurosurgery and CT stand by.
What do you got?

00:45.595 --> 00:48.120
Patient five: Broken femur.
Foot's pulseless.

00:48.331 --> 00:51.095
Mottled leg. Poor cap refill.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.462
- Can we move her?
- No, the seat's wedged.

00:53.670 --> 00:55.900
- How can I get to her?
- Up and around.

00:56.106 --> 00:57.801
All right.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.378
I want my mom! Help! Help!

01:11.588 --> 01:14.079
It's okay. Your parents are
on the way.

01:14.290 --> 01:15.757
Mom!

01:23.066 --> 01:25.000
Is this the broken femur?

01:25.201 --> 01:27.726
Scrapes and bruises. Pressure's 100.
Resps, 16.

01:27.937 --> 01:29.495
Gave her eight of morphine.

01:29.706 --> 01:32.402
- Any bleeding there?
- Not that I see. Name's JJ.

01:32.609 --> 01:35.578
Hi, JJ. My name's Mark.
How are you feeling?

01:35.779 --> 01:36.609
I'm scared.

01:36.813 --> 01:38.747
I know you are. Just hang in there.

01:38.948 --> 01:42.213
Your leg is broken.
But I need you to be brave for me.

01:42.418 --> 01:43.476
Can you be brave?

01:43.686 --> 01:45.551
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

01:45.755 --> 01:49.088
Splint that fracture as best you can.
Give her another blanket.

01:49.292 --> 01:51.351
- How long has she been trapped?
- About 30 minutes.

01:51.561 --> 01:53.586
- How much time we got?
- Time for what?

01:53.797 --> 01:55.856
- Till she loses her leg.
- 6 hours.

01:56.065 --> 01:57.259
- Any others trapped?
- Oh, yeah.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.197
A boy's jammed between
the seats under the grill.

02:00.403 --> 02:01.495
We can't get to him.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.934
- Take it easy, Dennis.
- We got a kid in the back!

02:04.140 --> 02:06.631
BP's 50 palp.
He's not moving his legs.

02:06.843 --> 02:10.244
IKeep an eye on her vitals.
Let me know if anything changes.

02:10.446 --> 02:13.506
Could be a lumbar-sacral plexus
injury with paralysis.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.411
Have you been reading the Rosen's?

02:15.618 --> 02:19.486
Taking the MCATs in a couple
of weeks. They popped it back.

02:20.089 --> 02:22.717
- What the hell is that?
- The crane.

02:23.526 --> 02:24.857
That ought to do it.

02:29.599 --> 02:33.592
Dr. Anspaugh, may I speak with you
for a moment, please?

02:33.803 --> 02:35.737
I have to finish my rounds.

02:35.939 --> 02:39.170
You know that Dr. Romano has closed
the ER clinic?

02:39.375 --> 02:41.809
You've left us little choice.

02:42.011 --> 02:43.444
You can't do it.

02:43.646 --> 02:47.810
Listen, I'm in a hurry. If you want
to discuss this, call my office.

02:48.017 --> 02:49.109
Set an appointment.

02:49.319 --> 02:50.911
Doctor, please.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.079
I have worked here for 10 years.
The clinic has made a real difference.

02:55.291 --> 02:58.226
Preventing illness,
helping people make better choices.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.328
I no longer trust your judgment.

03:00.530 --> 03:03.465
Hundreds of patients are to be
punished for my mistake?

03:03.666 --> 03:06.226
If this hospital pays
millions in damages...

03:06.436 --> 03:09.633
...more than a few hundred clinic
patients will go without treatment.

03:10.673 --> 03:13.039
Then I'll quit. I'll quit.

03:13.243 --> 03:16.041
I'll hand over the clinic to
someone else. Someone you do trust.

03:16.246 --> 03:19.511
But don't close it, please.
Not because of me.

03:31.761 --> 03:32.921
Jeanie?

03:37.166 --> 03:38.394
<i>911 emergency.</i>

03:38.601 --> 03:41.536
I've been in an accident.
I've got a woman badly hurt.

03:41.738 --> 03:43.729
I need help, please.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.888
- What's going on?
- School bus hit by a snowplow.

04:40.096 --> 04:42.121
Man, I was hoping
for an easier night.

04:42.332 --> 04:43.856
- How many?
- At least 15.

04:44.067 --> 04:45.432
I should've called in sick.

04:45.635 --> 04:48.263
Good evening. Good evening.
The board is up to date.

04:48.471 --> 04:50.701
Dr. Doyle is waiting for films
in Curtain 3.

04:50.907 --> 04:54.138
The lab is late with blood work for
Weaver in Exam 4.

04:54.344 --> 04:56.676
There are seven in Chairs,
and I'm out of here.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.507
Police are in Trauma.
I said to be out in 5 minutes.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.377
Jerry, where are you going?

05:01.584 --> 05:04.018
- I'm off at 7:30.
- Not until I say you're off.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.482
- Nurses too?
- You bet.

05:05.688 --> 05:07.155
- Damn!
- Carter and Lucy?

05:07.357 --> 05:08.346
In Exam 6.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.753
Carter and Lucy what, in Exam 6?

05:10.960 --> 05:13.053
Rural Minnesota, North Dakota.

05:13.262 --> 05:14.388
In the middle of winter?

05:14.597 --> 05:17.327
- It pays 4000 a week.
- It sounds miserable.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.024
Sounds like tuition
and a tutor for Reece to me.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.364
- What's coming in first?
- Blunt chest trauma, amputation...

05:23.573 --> 05:26.041
...and a kid with
a spinal cord injury.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.834
- All at once?
- Lovely.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.679
Medicine's taking the diabetics.

05:34.884 --> 05:36.875
They'll use them
for teaching service.

05:37.086 --> 05:40.578
OB's agreed to look after the
prenatals until the third trimester.

05:40.790 --> 05:43.418
- The rest are on their own.
- The clinic isn't closing.

05:44.293 --> 05:45.123
What?

05:45.828 --> 05:47.261
He decided to keep it open.

05:48.631 --> 05:52.465
That's great news! What did you
do, sell your first-born?

05:52.668 --> 05:54.101
No, I had to quit.

05:54.303 --> 05:55.395
You're joking.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.597
I get to keep my ER job,
but I'm out of management.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.303
So, who's gonna run the clinic?

06:02.178 --> 06:03.475
You are.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.913
No way. I don't want
that kind of responsibility.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.378
Tough.

06:08.584 --> 06:12.543
Paperwork, fundraising, endless crap
from Admit, I've done it. No, thanks.

06:12.755 --> 06:14.916
You'd rather shut down the clinic?

06:15.124 --> 06:18.855
I'm bad at it. I yell at the wrong
people, I piss everybody off.

06:19.062 --> 06:20.654
I'll be around. I'll help you out.

06:20.863 --> 06:24.856
It's either that, or all these
people have nowhere else to go.

06:26.702 --> 06:27.862
Your choice.

06:29.338 --> 06:30.362
Chuny, hi.

06:30.573 --> 06:33.007
- You got a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

06:34.310 --> 06:35.538
Earlier, with Lucy and I.

06:35.745 --> 06:39.181
I'm sure you have your suspicions
about what we were doing in there.

06:39.382 --> 06:40.644
But actually, we were just...

06:40.850 --> 06:42.681
- IKnocking boots?
- What?

06:42.885 --> 06:43.977
Doing the old nasty?

06:44.187 --> 06:45.984
The more the merrier, I say.

06:46.189 --> 06:48.384
Actually, we weren't doing anything.

06:48.724 --> 06:52.216
I mean, she's a med student, you know?
I'm a Resident.

06:52.428 --> 06:53.986
That stuff happens all the time.

06:54.197 --> 06:57.963
Lucy's like a little
sister or something to me.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.795
- You'd do that with your sister?
- Nothing happened!

07:01.003 --> 07:02.971
Besides, I have a girlfriend.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.571
That insurance lady?

07:04.774 --> 07:08.642
She's a financial adviser.
Roxanne and I have a lot in common.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.244
Units are pulling up!

07:10.446 --> 07:13.609
She's too pushy. Always trying
to sell you something.

07:13.816 --> 07:16.080
I'd stick with Lucy.
You two make a cute couple.

07:16.285 --> 07:18.253
We are not a couple!

07:18.454 --> 07:20.149
Maggie, Elizabeth, take the first.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.551
Carter, Lucy, on three.
Peter, come with me.

07:22.758 --> 07:25.522
Ten-year-old female.
Amputation below the left wrist.

07:25.728 --> 07:27.821
BP 90/60. Heart rate 120.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.497
Lost 500 cc's of blood.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.065
- Do you have the hand?
- They're looking for it at the site.

07:32.268 --> 07:35.396
Nine-year-old slammed into the edge
of the seat in front of him.

07:35.605 --> 07:38.938
He can't move his legs. Resps 16.
BP's down to 70/40.

07:39.142 --> 07:41.610
- Could be a lumbar fracture.
- Or spinal shock.

07:41.811 --> 07:44.541
Internal bleeding, more likely.
Get an ultrasound!

07:44.747 --> 07:48.877
Fourteen-year-old female,
blunt chest trauma. BP's 80/40.

07:49.085 --> 07:50.552
- Pneumothorax?
- Or hemopneumothorax.

07:50.753 --> 07:52.118
- I need an ultrasound!
- X-ray!

07:52.321 --> 07:55.256
Trauma 2! Maggie, Trauma 1!
Carter, take Exam 2.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.755
We got a pneumothorax!

07:57.026 --> 07:59.324
Tear it down! Just tear it down!
Let's go!

07:59.529 --> 08:01.156
- This is a crime scene!
- Not anymore.

08:01.364 --> 08:03.059
Let's clear this crap out of here.

08:03.266 --> 08:05.325
Abdomen's soft.
Decreased bowel sounds.

08:05.535 --> 08:08.470
Okay, no reflexes below the waist.

08:08.671 --> 08:12.198
Let's get a cross-table lumbar
and hang steroids. Get out. Go.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.535
- What happened here?
- I'll tell you later.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.302
I'm so cold.

08:16.512 --> 08:18.844
Carol, check up on the other patients.

08:20.783 --> 08:22.774
BP's 80/50.

08:22.985 --> 08:25.215
Strong brachial pulse.
Get me another BP cuff.

08:25.421 --> 08:26.388
Okay.

08:26.622 --> 08:30.615
The amputation is distal to
the radius and the ulna.

08:30.826 --> 08:32.191
I'll clamp that bleeder.

08:32.395 --> 08:33.692
- How are you doing?
- Peachy.

08:33.895 --> 08:34.919
Can you save it?

08:35.131 --> 08:38.225
If they find the hand,
maybe we've got a chance.

08:40.035 --> 08:42.095
- Pulse ox down to 88.
- You doing okay?

08:42.304 --> 08:45.172
Her sats dropped
and respiratory's getting worse.

08:45.374 --> 08:46.898
- Portable x-ray?
- Corday's got it.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.736
Can't wait. Get a chest tube tray.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.038
Lucy, palpate the fifth
intercostal space.

08:51.247 --> 08:52.305
Like this?

08:52.515 --> 08:55.279
Yeah, that's right.
Now incise with the scalpel.

08:55.484 --> 08:58.146
Spread with the IKelly.
Insert your finger.

09:00.089 --> 09:02.114
- God, what is that?
- What? Bag for me.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.753
- It's intestine.
- Is the incision too low?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.224
No, diaphragm's ruptured.

09:07.430 --> 09:10.922
The force of the impact must've
pushed everything up. Call the O.R.

09:17.373 --> 09:18.840
No free fluid in the belly.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.100
Everyone's okay.
Carter's got a ruptured diaphragm.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.402
Corday called Vascular.

09:22.612 --> 09:23.943
Two ambulances are coming.

09:24.146 --> 09:27.741
Patients are stable, with multiple
lacerations and possible fractures.

09:27.950 --> 09:28.780
Foley cath is in.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.283
Tell me when they're here.
Have Jeanie suture.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.886
- Jeanie's not here.
- Where is she?

09:33.089 --> 09:34.488
- I don't know.
- Doug can do it.

09:34.690 --> 09:35.850
- No.
- Just lacerations?

09:36.058 --> 09:37.184
I said, no.

09:37.393 --> 09:38.724
He's got gross hematuria.

09:38.928 --> 09:42.386
Prep for one-shot IVP.
Call CT. Let's move.

09:42.598 --> 09:44.429
Jerry, find Jeanie. We need her.

09:44.634 --> 09:46.864
- Find her how?
- I don't know. Just find her.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.472
Hey! Let's go!

09:54.677 --> 09:56.338
Come on!

09:56.545 --> 09:58.775
I got a woman in the car!

09:59.382 --> 10:02.545
I need gloves! I need gloves!
I'm a doctor.

10:02.752 --> 10:06.552
I've got a woman with multiple
lacerations. She's HIV-positive.

10:06.756 --> 10:08.951
- What happened?
- I slid on the ice.

10:09.158 --> 10:11.092
She's unconscious.

10:11.761 --> 10:15.128
I lost control. She wasn't wearing
a seat belt. Hang on, hang on.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.530
Jeanie?

10:19.135 --> 10:21.695
All right. I got her.

10:23.639 --> 10:26.073
All right, Jeanie. Nice and easy.

10:27.843 --> 10:30.073
Jeanie? You got a light?

10:30.279 --> 10:32.213
Yeah. Right here.

10:32.415 --> 10:33.939
Carotid.

10:36.185 --> 10:37.777
No step off.

10:38.788 --> 10:41.279
Multiple lacerations.

10:41.490 --> 10:44.323
Pupils are equal and reactive.

10:44.527 --> 10:45.551
Let's transport her.

10:46.028 --> 10:48.053
Hang in there, Jeanie.
Hang in there.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.131
It's unstable. If I lift...

10:51.334 --> 10:53.859
...the weight may shift forward
and crush everything.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.503
How about attaching it in front?

10:55.705 --> 10:58.139
I don't know.
I could take the chassis.

10:58.341 --> 11:01.174
We just need the weight lifted
to pull the kids out.

11:01.377 --> 11:04.869
I've got some railroad ties.
We can put some under the chassis...

11:05.081 --> 11:07.572
...take weight off the blades,
and put it back.

11:07.783 --> 11:09.751
Let's do it.
Boys, we need some muscle.

11:09.952 --> 11:10.782
Doc!

11:10.986 --> 11:15.252
I found the hand. A finger is
smashed up, but otherwise it's okay.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.894
All right, pack it in saline gauze
with ice and get it to County.

11:19.495 --> 11:20.427
How's she doing?

11:20.629 --> 11:22.995
She's calmer, but she's still
in a lot of pain.

11:23.199 --> 11:25.531
Hang in there, JJ.
We'll get you out.

11:25.735 --> 11:26.565
I hurt.

11:26.769 --> 11:27.736
How much morphine?

11:27.937 --> 11:30.428
Twenty mgs.
Her respiratory rate's down.

11:30.639 --> 11:32.402
Give her five more.
Watch her breathing.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.235
- Trapped boy stopped talking.
- When?

11:34.443 --> 11:37.935
- A couple minutes ago.
- Dennis, can you hear me?

11:38.948 --> 11:41.178
We're running out of time.
We've gotta go.

11:41.384 --> 11:42.544
One under the front.

11:42.752 --> 11:44.379
What's all the noise?

11:44.587 --> 11:46.817
We're trying to get you out.
I got it.

11:47.022 --> 11:48.853
All right, we're ready.
Everybody out.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.316
- I'm not coming.
- The hell you're not!

11:51.527 --> 11:52.721
I'm staying here!

11:52.928 --> 11:56.193
Go on, get out.
Go, go, go. It's all right.

11:57.366 --> 11:58.196
Here, doc.

12:01.003 --> 12:03.631
Don't worry, darling.
I'm right here with you.

12:03.839 --> 12:06.569
Okay, doc. Let's go.
Take it up!

12:06.776 --> 12:10.337
It's okay. Don't worry,
I'm right here.

12:10.546 --> 12:14.038
It's gonna be a little loud.
Okay? Just relax.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.842
Here we go. Up!

12:25.361 --> 12:27.522
Okay, JJ. It's almost over.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.855
That's it! Freeze!

12:30.065 --> 12:31.896
All right, let's go!

12:33.169 --> 12:36.627
Okay, I need somebody to guide
the leg on the other side.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.500
- I got it.
- Good. Good.

12:38.707 --> 12:40.675
- We got a popper!
- I'm on it.

12:40.876 --> 12:43.276
Watch the femur.
Unstable open fracture.

12:43.479 --> 12:45.606
Careful. Careful.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.151
Apply a pressure dressing.
Get traction on that leg.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.548
- Let's find the boy.
- I got him! I got him!

12:55.958 --> 12:56.947
Is he breathing?

12:57.159 --> 12:59.127
Resps about 16 and shallow.

12:59.328 --> 13:03.162
He's got multiple lacerations and
a fracture to the right forearm.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.889
We found the boy! He's alive!

13:05.100 --> 13:07.398
- Can you get him out?
- We need a backboard.

13:07.603 --> 13:10.436
You won't be able to move him.
We'll try from the outside.

13:11.607 --> 13:12.631
We need you here!

13:13.476 --> 13:15.569
I got him. Go. Go.

13:16.011 --> 13:18.241
Leg's a mess.
She's losing a lot of blood.

13:18.447 --> 13:21.610
Pump up a BP cuff proximal to
the fracture...

13:21.817 --> 13:23.648
...and clamp it off with a hemostat.

13:23.853 --> 13:26.344
That ought to hold it till
she gets to the ER.

13:28.324 --> 13:31.384
Have Ortho and Vascular
ready to do an angiogram.

13:31.594 --> 13:33.585
Tell them we don't have much time.

13:34.830 --> 13:37.993
- Are you going with me?
- I'll meet you there, okay, JJ.?

13:38.467 --> 13:39.900
- Okay.
- All right.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.431
BP's 90/60. Pulse 120.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.268
Large contusion
over both upper quadrants.

13:47.476 --> 13:52.209
Evaluate for a splenic rupture.
Start two lines and transport him.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.713
The twos and threes are transported.
All we have are minors.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.613
Get the kids to us as soon
as you can.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.815
- Good work, skipper.
- Thanks, doc.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.262
What?

14:11.467 --> 14:13.298
They're all alive.

14:14.003 --> 14:15.630
So far.

14:22.978 --> 14:27.210
David Martino. M-A-R-T-l-N-O.

14:27.416 --> 14:29.043
The police told us that our daughter
was brought in here.

14:29.251 --> 14:33.017
Please, I know you're worried,
but yelling at me won't help.

14:33.222 --> 14:35.850
I need your name and your child's
name so we can...

14:36.058 --> 14:38.686
Blunt trauma to the abdomen.
Response to crystalloids.

14:38.894 --> 14:41.226
He just dropped his pressure again.

14:41.430 --> 14:42.954
That's my son. Dennis, you okay?

14:43.165 --> 14:45.292
He was trapped. He's stable now.

14:45.501 --> 14:47.731
He needs further evaluation and tests.

14:47.937 --> 14:49.063
What kind of tests?

14:49.271 --> 14:52.934
You'll have to wait outside.
We'll find you when we know more.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.043
- He'll be all right?
- Yosh, can you help this gentleman?

14:56.245 --> 14:58.304
Sir, let the doctors do their work.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.140
Shocky. Could be a spleen injury.

15:02.351 --> 15:05.479
We'll need an ultrasound or a DPL.
How are the rest?

15:05.688 --> 15:07.053
The amputation's in the O.R.

15:07.256 --> 15:09.588
- The hand made it?
- Yeah. One, two, three.

15:09.792 --> 15:15.094
Anspaugh took the fractured kidney.
Romano got the ruptured diaphragm.

15:15.297 --> 15:17.561
Type and cross for six.
Get a stat H & H.

15:17.766 --> 15:20.462
BP's 80/60. Pulse 120.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.701
The girl with the pulseless foot?

15:22.905 --> 15:24.930
Corday's got her,
prepping for an angiogram.

15:25.140 --> 15:27.608
Conni, can you see if CT
can take another one?

15:27.810 --> 15:30.244
- No seat belts on the bus?
- No.

15:30.446 --> 15:32.209
Airbags in every new car in America...

15:32.414 --> 15:35.406
...but we send children off
like lambs to the slaughter.

15:35.618 --> 15:37.449
You're a mess. Get cleaned up.

15:37.653 --> 15:39.177
Great. Thanks.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.985
Out of the way! Out of the way!

15:44.193 --> 15:45.023
How is she?

15:45.227 --> 15:48.458
Big subdural on CT. Neurosurgery's
waiting. Let's go!

15:48.664 --> 15:51.565
- Birth date?
- September 5th, 1989.

15:52.401 --> 15:55.063
- Hypothermic boy's coming in.
- I'll be right back out.

15:55.571 --> 15:58.039
- Somebody order four pizzas?
- Yeah.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.434
$42.50.

15:59.642 --> 16:03.100
Bus driver's in Cardiology.
I'll take the eye injury in Exam 1.

16:03.312 --> 16:04.870
County General. Come in, 29.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.071
I got a kid that needs 50
stitches. Where's Lucy?

16:07.282 --> 16:09.944
She's in surgery on
that ruptured diaphragm.

16:10.152 --> 16:11.312
- Jeanie?
- Still AWOL.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.647
Call somebody and get them down here.

16:13.856 --> 16:14.754
Who else is coming in?

16:14.957 --> 16:17.425
- Hypothermic kid, two minutes out.
- I'll take him.

16:18.794 --> 16:22.423
Found him 20 yards from the wreck.
Must've been thrown by the collision.

16:22.631 --> 16:24.599
Blunt abdominal trauma.
No head injury.

16:24.800 --> 16:29.396
BP 70 palp, pulse 40. Name, Anthony
Martino, it was written on his jacket.

16:29.872 --> 16:31.362
He's throwing PVCs.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.371
Must've irritated his heart.
Warm peritoneal lavage!

16:38.380 --> 16:39.472
How's she doing?

16:39.682 --> 16:42.412
The angiogram showed a partial
tear in the popliteal.

16:42.618 --> 16:44.848
I reduced her fracture,
got back a weak pulse.

16:45.054 --> 16:49.218
There's good collateral circulation.
We bought Vascular a little time.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.450
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:52.661 --> 16:54.595
I see you still have your
fireman's hat.

16:54.797 --> 16:55.923
Is my mom here?

16:56.131 --> 16:58.099
I'm not sure, but I'll go find out.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.562
What's your last name?

16:59.768 --> 17:00.792
Mitchell.

17:01.003 --> 17:02.766
I'll find her if she's here, JJ.

17:05.641 --> 17:07.199
How long until they take her upstairs?

17:07.409 --> 17:10.674
They're handling life threats.
Limb threats are stacked up.

17:10.878 --> 17:12.243
It's been three hours.

17:12.448 --> 17:16.214
I'll wait another hour, then call
around to transport her.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.545
Don't wait. Call now.

17:19.688 --> 17:22.248
O.R.'s backed up. Some surgeons
can't make it in.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.153
- He can't wait. Take him.
- What's up?

17:24.358 --> 17:26.623
DPL's positive. He's going up.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.990
- Call the blood bank on that blood.
- Right.

17:29.198 --> 17:30.256
- Dr. Greene?
- Liver?

17:30.466 --> 17:33.492
- Spleen.
- Core temp's 84, DPL's positive.

17:33.702 --> 17:34.896
Give him warmed
intra-abdominal fluids?

17:35.104 --> 17:38.471
I held up the peritoneal lavage so I
wouldn't dislodge a clot in his liver.

17:38.674 --> 17:41.871
Start the bladder rewarming.
More meds, Yosh!

17:42.077 --> 17:43.237
Yes. On the way.

17:43.545 --> 17:45.376
Paramedics coming in.
IKid in the rig.

17:45.581 --> 17:46.548
- From the bus?
- Yeah.

17:46.749 --> 17:49.775
- Clear a Trauma Room.
- I'll check Carter's hypothermic kid.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.247
- Dr. Greene?
- What?

17:51.453 --> 17:54.047
IKobe Ekabo.
You talked to my husband.

17:54.256 --> 17:56.918
Yes. I'm sorry,
it's a little hectic now.

17:57.126 --> 17:58.718
We went to see the doctor.

17:58.927 --> 18:01.327
Mobalage is scheduled for
surgery tomorrow.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.998
See if there's someone here for
a JJ Mitchell.

18:04.199 --> 18:06.565
- Hey, Carol, got a minute?
- Yeah. What's up?

18:07.236 --> 18:08.760
I'm sorry. What?

18:08.971 --> 18:12.600
- The surgery might be a mistake.
- Why?

18:12.808 --> 18:15.276
- Does he need it?
- Lf he wants to get better.

18:15.477 --> 18:17.809
Does he need to get better?

18:18.013 --> 18:20.174
- Oh, God!
- Carol! Carol!

18:20.415 --> 18:25.182
Mrs. Ekabo, it's normal for you
to have anxiety before a surgery.

18:25.954 --> 18:28.855
There's always risk, but for your
husband, it's minimal.

18:29.057 --> 18:31.787
- He should regain full function.
- Hey, we need a hand!

18:31.994 --> 18:33.894
- Which one is it?
- Patient number 13.

18:34.096 --> 18:35.893
Broken ribs, minor head injuries.

18:36.098 --> 18:39.158
- I thought she was stable.
- Crashed en route. No vitals.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.835
Tubed her but couldn't find a line.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.901
- How long?
- Eight minutes.

18:43.105 --> 18:46.097
Let's go, darling. Here we go.

18:52.414 --> 18:55.542
Pupils midrange and sluggish.
Jerry, where are we?

18:55.751 --> 18:57.218
Pedes clinic's the best I can do.

18:57.419 --> 19:00.149
- Dr. Greene?
- Mrs. Ekabo, I can't talk right now.

19:00.355 --> 19:01.982
Wait in Chairs. I'll be there soon.

19:02.191 --> 19:04.386
- No pulse without CPR.
- Last epi?

19:04.593 --> 19:07.061
- Three minutes.
- Another amp down the ET tube.

19:07.262 --> 19:09.321
- What happened to Carol?
- Doug and Jeanie crashed.

19:09.531 --> 19:11.931
Doug's okay, Jeanie's hurt.
Unit 29 has them.

19:12.134 --> 19:14.295
Mark, in here!

19:15.103 --> 19:17.663
Vitals are stable.
Contusions to face, forehead, abdomen.

19:17.873 --> 19:19.033
Precautions, everyone.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.607
BP is 130/90. Pulse ox 98.

19:21.810 --> 19:23.004
She just came to.

19:23.212 --> 19:24.372
- What is today?
- Thursday.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.377
- Doug, are you okay?
- She lost consciousness.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.846
Trachea midline. No chest injuries.
No seat belt.

19:29.051 --> 19:29.949
Stupid, huh?

19:31.486 --> 19:34.216
- Doug, let's see your head.
- We need a CT and trauma panel.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.253
We got it. Back off.

19:35.457 --> 19:38.551
Guarding tenderness in
the right quadrant. Get a CT!

19:38.760 --> 19:41.251
Everybody, back to work!
Get out of there, Doug!

19:41.463 --> 19:43.397
- Dr. Ross, step back!
- Might be her liver.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.066
We'll catch it if she does.

19:46.134 --> 19:47.965
The hypothermic 10-year-old's
in trouble.

19:48.170 --> 19:49.330
- Peter, you got her?
- Yeah.

19:49.538 --> 19:50.436
I'll be back.

19:50.639 --> 19:52.573
I'll take Carter.
You stay with Jeanie.

19:52.774 --> 19:53.741
No, I'll take Carter.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.433
- It's a Pedes case.
- You're off this station!

19:56.645 --> 19:59.045
You're not working in this hospital!
Not tonight!

19:59.248 --> 20:01.739
Now sit down and let Carol
look at your head.

20:06.221 --> 20:09.952
All right. No peritoneal signs.
Let's get the trauma panel.

20:10.158 --> 20:11.090
Come on.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.761
Get a CT on the head and the belly.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.122
Get the O-neg!

20:17.766 --> 20:20.792
We're actively rewarming with Foley,
NG, and ET...

20:21.003 --> 20:23.164
...but he's still hypothermic at
84 degrees.

20:23.372 --> 20:25.533
- What do you suggest?
- Binary bypass?

20:25.741 --> 20:28.904
- Heart rate's down to 30, BP's 60.
- He's soaked.

20:30.445 --> 20:32.709
Conductive loss.
Get these wet clothes off.

20:32.915 --> 20:34.883
You're in the right direction.
No bypass.

20:35.083 --> 20:39.144
Just keep warming. Notify the O.R.
They've got another ex-lap pending.

20:39.354 --> 20:42.118
- What if he goes into V-fib?
- He won't make it to O.R.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.088
Mark, I couldn't find anybody
for a JJ Mitchell.

20:45.294 --> 20:47.228
Want me to see if we have
a phone number?

20:47.429 --> 20:49.294
Could you?
How are Doug and Jeanie?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.796
Okay. Jeanie's got a concussion.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.864
Why is everyone in the hall?

20:54.069 --> 20:56.333
The beds are full and the minors
are showing up.

20:56.538 --> 20:58.472
We got a broken jaw with a tongue
laceration coming in.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.609
Call Medicine and see if
they can spare Residents.

21:01.810 --> 21:05.610
O.R. Is still backed up. I'll start
calling around to other hospitals.

21:05.814 --> 21:07.042
Is it a surgical case?

21:07.249 --> 21:10.241
Yep. Girl with an open fracture.
We're out of time.

21:10.452 --> 21:12.386
- Where's my ruptured spleen?
- Trauma 1.

21:12.587 --> 21:14.316
Thank you.
It's a great teaching case.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.388
If we don't get to her,
she'll lose a leg.

21:16.591 --> 21:18.058
We've got at least two hours.

21:18.260 --> 21:20.194
- Call Mercy anyway.
- Damn right.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.461
You're gonna need sutures.

21:27.936 --> 21:30.837
Sorry for everything.

21:35.844 --> 21:38.404
I'll go to Anspaugh, throw myself
on my sword...

21:38.613 --> 21:40.774
...and see if he'll open the clinic.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.648
Anspaugh's gonna keep the clinic open.

21:45.954 --> 21:47.717
He change his mind?

21:48.290 --> 21:50.224
I threw myself on my sword.

21:50.926 --> 21:53.656
Lynette Evans is gonna
take over the clinic.

21:54.363 --> 21:58.094
I'm back to my blue-collar roots.
Punching the clock in the ER.

22:03.138 --> 22:05.038
I don't know what to say.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.674
There isn't anything to say.
It's done.

22:08.977 --> 22:11.343
We just have to accept it and move on.

22:12.814 --> 22:14.406
I'm gonna resign.

22:17.152 --> 22:20.019
Take responsibility for everything
that happened.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.889
I'm destroying my relationship
with you.

22:28.864 --> 22:31.196
I've probably lost my best friend.

22:32.067 --> 22:35.525
I've certainly damaged both of
your careers.

22:39.408 --> 22:41.569
I hate Weaver. I hate Romano.

22:43.745 --> 22:44.871
It's time to go.

22:46.982 --> 22:48.279
Where?

22:48.483 --> 22:51.418
I liked Seattle when I was
in med school.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.450
Seattle?

22:53.555 --> 22:57.889
The Pacific Northwest.
Take that job offer in Portland.

22:59.161 --> 23:01.152
It's pretty up there. It's clear.

23:02.264 --> 23:03.253
You'd like it.

23:10.338 --> 23:11.965
Come with me.

23:14.009 --> 23:15.533
We got another rig coming in.

23:15.744 --> 23:17.405
I'll be right there.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.915
I love you.

23:34.563 --> 23:36.258
I grew up here.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.591
My family's here, my friends.

23:40.802 --> 23:42.133
My job.

23:42.437 --> 23:43.529
You just got demoted.

23:43.738 --> 23:46.468
You had something to do with that,
didn't you?

23:59.521 --> 24:01.284
Come with me.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.559
I gotta get back to work.
We'll talk about it later.

24:22.410 --> 24:25.436
Vitals stable. Lacs to the abdomen,
dislocated right index finger...

24:25.647 --> 24:26.636
...and an ear laceration.

24:26.848 --> 24:28.839
My hoop earring got stuck on my coat.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.143
- How many more coming in?
- Elise is the last.

24:31.353 --> 24:32.650
Mark, Maggie needs you in 2.

24:32.854 --> 24:34.481
Okay. Find a spot for her.

24:35.490 --> 24:37.754
Oh, man. Mrs. Ekabo.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.557
- Carol, you have a second?
- Not really.

24:40.762 --> 24:43.925
Can you talk to Mrs. Ekabo?
This is Mobalage's wife.

24:44.132 --> 24:48.262
He's having surgery for erectile
dysfunction and she's anxious.

24:48.470 --> 24:49.402
Okay, sure.

24:49.604 --> 24:54.701
Mrs. Ekabo, I'm sorry. Nurse Hathaway
will answer your questions, okay?

24:56.144 --> 24:57.873
I'll be right with you.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.513
Jeanie's head CT is normal.
No sign of a bleed.

25:00.715 --> 25:04.014
Her abdominal CT shows a small amount
of fluid around the liver.

25:04.219 --> 25:07.518
- That could be blood.
- No. Liver's intact, no laceration.

25:07.722 --> 25:11.123
There's pain on palpation?
Are these her labs?

25:12.060 --> 25:13.186
CBC's normal.

25:13.395 --> 25:17.058
LFT's elevated. Especially ALT.
PT's high.

25:17.265 --> 25:22.134
From a trauma? Bilirubin is
abnormal. Albumin is low.

25:25.740 --> 25:26.604
What do you think?

25:26.808 --> 25:30.642
These results don't have
anything to do with the accident.

25:30.845 --> 25:33.905
- Yeah.
- So, what do you want to do?

25:34.549 --> 25:37.416
Draw up a hepatitis panel.
Give her some vitamin IK.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.213
Admit her to Medicine for
a liver biopsy.

25:51.132 --> 25:55.626
Oh, Mrs. Ekabo.
I'm sorry for making you wait.

25:55.837 --> 25:57.168
Do you want a soda?

25:59.441 --> 26:03.343
Dr. Greene said you have questions
about your husband's surgery.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.705
Do you know what happened to Mobalage?

26:07.916 --> 26:10.942
He was tortured in Nigeria, right?

26:13.188 --> 26:16.589
Dr. Greene said that after tomorrow...

26:16.791 --> 26:20.283
...he'll be able to
have relations again?

26:21.129 --> 26:22.721
Yes, if it's successful.

26:24.266 --> 26:26.393
I don't know if I can.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.136
Can you tell me why not?

26:35.577 --> 26:40.446
Mobalage was a student leader.
A dissident.

26:41.182 --> 26:44.447
After they tortured him, he fled.

26:44.653 --> 26:49.090
And when I joined him, he was happy
we were together...

26:49.291 --> 26:51.657
...but not interested in me
in that way.

26:53.395 --> 26:54.623
Well...

26:55.797 --> 26:58.425
...you have to help him through this.

27:00.235 --> 27:03.068
I should go. I'm sorry to bother you.

27:03.271 --> 27:05.933
Wait, Mrs. Ekabo.

27:06.341 --> 27:07.740
What is it?

27:10.345 --> 27:14.338
- I can't...
- You can't what?

27:17.952 --> 27:19.783
After he left...

27:20.889 --> 27:22.754
...they came for me.

27:24.759 --> 27:26.556
Ten soldiers.

27:28.997 --> 27:31.261
Each took their turn.

27:32.367 --> 27:35.859
All night and into the next day...

27:37.572 --> 27:39.506
...in our home.

27:46.281 --> 27:48.511
I never told him.

27:49.918 --> 27:53.046
I want him to be happy...

27:54.823 --> 27:57.883
...but I don't know if I can be
with a man again.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.357
You have to tell him.

28:01.563 --> 28:04.964
No. It would kill him.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.466
But he loves you.

28:08.503 --> 28:09.834
No.

28:20.815 --> 28:21.839
Hey.

28:22.050 --> 28:23.642
Hey.

28:24.319 --> 28:27.152
I didn't mean to wake you up. Sorry.

28:28.623 --> 28:29.885
What time is it?

28:33.128 --> 28:34.595
It's 2:30.

28:35.597 --> 28:37.724
Sutures look great. Who did them?

28:37.932 --> 28:41.663
Peter. Took forever.

28:42.203 --> 28:45.331
He's kind of a perfectionist,
if you hadn't noticed.

28:46.241 --> 28:49.267
We got a bed for you upstairs
so you can...

28:49.477 --> 28:51.536
...get some real sleep.

28:52.046 --> 28:52.876
How you feeling?

28:53.748 --> 28:55.010
Sore.

28:57.919 --> 28:59.477
So, what is it?

29:00.288 --> 29:01.880
Peter took some more blood.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.755
How have you been feeling lately?

29:12.300 --> 29:14.734
A little rundown. Is it AIDS?

29:14.936 --> 29:15.766
No.

29:17.939 --> 29:20.271
Your T-cell count was normal.

29:20.475 --> 29:23.672
But your liver function tests
indicate...

29:23.878 --> 29:26.312
...that you might have hepatitis.

29:26.514 --> 29:30.541
And your abdominal CT showed
a small amount of fluid...

29:30.752 --> 29:32.811
...around your liver capsule.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.590
Have you been tested?

29:38.293 --> 29:40.193
Yeah. I had...

29:43.131 --> 29:46.225
...a hepatitis B vaccination
five or six years ago.

29:46.434 --> 29:49.403
I hadn't had an A.

29:50.772 --> 29:52.672
So you think it's C?

29:52.874 --> 29:58.005
It might be. We need to admit you
and do a few tests.

29:59.814 --> 30:01.441
That sounds like the doctor answer.

30:01.649 --> 30:05.608
I was kind of hoping for
the "good friend" answer.

30:08.022 --> 30:09.990
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:10.191 --> 30:12.284
That would be my guess.

30:18.099 --> 30:22.559
All this time I'm worrying about HIV
and I get hepatitis C?

30:23.538 --> 30:24.732
Huh?

30:27.242 --> 30:31.008
We should do the biopsy.
I might be wrong.

30:31.212 --> 30:32.543
Wouldn't be the first time.

30:33.481 --> 30:35.847
Maybe the second time, huh?

30:37.685 --> 30:39.812
Maybe the third time.

30:44.158 --> 30:47.025
Wow. I just thought she was
anxious about the surgery.

30:47.228 --> 30:50.061
- She is.
- It's scheduled for this morning.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.096
I know. We need to get them therapy.

30:52.300 --> 30:57.101
I'll call Riley. See if he knows
anybody who specializes in PTSD...

30:57.305 --> 30:58.636
...in torture victims.

30:59.908 --> 31:02.502
Doug says he's gonna quit.

31:04.812 --> 31:05.938
Yeah?

31:06.714 --> 31:08.705
I think he's serious.

31:11.085 --> 31:12.814
Maybe he should.

31:15.490 --> 31:17.082
You want him to go?

31:18.893 --> 31:20.690
I'm done, Carol.

31:21.896 --> 31:24.023
I love him like a brother...

31:24.232 --> 31:27.326
...but I can't do this anymore.
It's too hard.

31:29.270 --> 31:32.137
He says he wants to move
to Seattle or Portland.

31:32.340 --> 31:33.898
Wants me to go with him.

31:36.778 --> 31:38.109
Are you going to?

31:40.915 --> 31:44.817
I can't remember a time
when I didn't love him.

31:54.862 --> 31:56.830
I'll miss you.

31:57.932 --> 31:59.923
Maybe more than I'll miss him.

32:15.149 --> 32:16.138
I gotta go.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.430
Mrs. Martino.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.005
Anthony's stable.

32:40.608 --> 32:41.700
So is he okay?

32:41.909 --> 32:44.241
Well, he'll need
exploratory surgery...

32:44.445 --> 32:46.242
...but I think he's gonna be fine.

32:46.447 --> 32:49.575
- Can I see him?
- Yes, please. Follow me.

33:00.728 --> 33:01.717
Thank you.

33:04.499 --> 33:06.433
She seems happy.

33:06.634 --> 33:07.931
Very.

33:08.970 --> 33:10.801
It's gonna be light soon.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.931
When did you sleep last?

33:14.142 --> 33:17.270
Day before yesterday. You?

33:17.812 --> 33:22.715
Twenty-four hours ago.
I feel like an Intern again.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.080
- Good work.
- Yeah. You too.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.839
Is this where you work?

33:57.385 --> 33:59.114
Most of the time, yeah.

34:06.227 --> 34:09.355
I'm surprised to see you're still here
this late at night.

34:10.297 --> 34:13.755
I thought doctors made life-and-death
decisions about people's families...

34:13.967 --> 34:18.166
...and then go home to million-dollar
homes and Stoli martinis.

34:25.913 --> 34:28.313
He was in agony. He was dying.

34:28.516 --> 34:30.108
Not in days, in hours.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.945
You stole my son from me.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.322
Joi called and I caught
the first flight out.

34:37.525 --> 34:40.119
I came as quickly as I could.

34:41.295 --> 34:45.163
Ricky died and I wasn't there.
I didn't get to hold his hand.

34:45.366 --> 34:47.458
I didn't get to say goodbye.

34:48.268 --> 34:50.737
You stole that from me.

35:00.615 --> 35:01.980
That's disgusting.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.048
Really? It's not bad.

35:04.252 --> 35:07.119
I might get another one.
Got any more quarters?

35:08.256 --> 35:10.349
Deep stab wound to the chest with a
large kitchen knife.

35:10.558 --> 35:13.959
BP's 70 palp. Ran two liters saline,
couldn't get the pressure up.

35:14.162 --> 35:15.629
Pulse ox is 91 on 10 liters.

35:15.830 --> 35:17.354
Mark, it's Mrs. Ekabo.

35:17.565 --> 35:19.829
- What? What happened?
- Her husband freaked out.

35:20.101 --> 35:23.537
Called 911, but wouldn't let us in.
She was bleeding all over.

35:23.738 --> 35:27.970
Hang two units O-neg, order four type-
specific and crossmatch another four.

35:28.176 --> 35:29.803
Pulse is weak and thready at 140.

35:30.011 --> 35:31.444
Okay, we'll do this on my count.

35:31.646 --> 35:35.742
Nice and easy. Ready?
One, two, three.

35:36.184 --> 35:38.118
- Let's get an EIKG.
- Poor cap refill.

35:38.319 --> 35:39.616
Mark, she's cold.

35:39.821 --> 35:41.789
No breath on the right.
Tracheal shift to the left.

35:41.989 --> 35:43.422
She's got dilated neck veins.

35:43.624 --> 35:46.024
Tension pneumo, 14 gauge.
I'll decompress.

35:46.227 --> 35:47.785
- Where's her husband?
- Jumped out the window.

35:47.995 --> 35:50.520
- What?
- Cops had to ram down the door.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.756
They were chasing him when we left.

35:52.967 --> 35:54.434
Where's the trauma team?!

35:55.102 --> 35:56.831
- Not very compatible.

35:57.038 --> 36:00.496
So the best thing for us to do
is to go back to being...

36:00.708 --> 36:02.232
- Hey!
- Hi. Hey!

36:02.443 --> 36:04.570
- What are you doing up here?
- Waiting for you.

36:04.779 --> 36:06.076
Really?

36:06.347 --> 36:10.477
Yeah. Look, is there someplace
that we can go?

36:11.085 --> 36:13.610
Back to my dorm.
My roommate leaves by 6:30.

36:13.821 --> 36:14.913
Your dorm...

36:15.122 --> 36:16.248
Your place, then.

36:16.457 --> 36:19.449
Weaver's house. No, no.
See, this is the problem.

36:19.660 --> 36:22.185
- You're a student and I'm a Resident.
- Right. So you said.

36:22.396 --> 36:25.126
- We're not very compatible.
- That's true.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.597
Few people drive me crazy
the way that you do.

36:27.802 --> 36:30.532
Yeah. And you irritate
the hell out of me.

36:30.738 --> 36:34.970
Right. Right, so clearly this
is not something that's gonna work.

36:35.810 --> 36:38.643
Between hospital policy
and us not liking each other...

36:38.846 --> 36:42.441
...we should accept that yesterday
was a mistake and we should...

36:42.650 --> 36:44.743
Things should go back to
the way they were.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.284
That's the smartest thing
to do for all involved.

36:47.488 --> 36:49.888
Oh. We could just have sex.

36:50.091 --> 36:52.685
We can't have sex!
I don't want to have...

36:52.894 --> 36:54.293
Hi. How are you?

36:54.495 --> 36:55.462
It was a mistake.

36:55.663 --> 36:58.359
Got you. You're really gullible,
you know that?

36:58.566 --> 36:59.897
- That wasn't funny.
- Sure it is.

37:00.101 --> 37:03.434
You don't want to hang out, fine.
I'm not attracted to you anyway.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.163
- You're not?
- You're closed-off for my taste.

37:06.374 --> 37:07.466
Closed-off?

37:07.675 --> 37:09.973
Emotionally withdrawn.
Not in touch with your feelings.

37:10.177 --> 37:11.303
- I am not.
- Sure you are.

37:11.512 --> 37:13.480
Just forget it!
We're not compatible.

37:13.681 --> 37:16.445
I'm in touch with my feelings.
I want to throttle you.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.949
"Throttle"?
An in-touch-with-your-feelings word.

37:19.153 --> 37:22.589
- Ridiculing my vocabulary?
- I just meant opposites attract.

37:22.790 --> 37:25.554
We sound like my grandparents.
Married 56 years.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.352
Still having great sex too.

38:21.749 --> 38:24.718
- My wife, is she dead?
- No.

38:25.519 --> 38:27.146
Where are they taking her?

38:27.355 --> 38:30.256
To surgery.
They're trying to save her.

38:30.891 --> 38:31.858
Can they?

38:32.059 --> 38:33.356
I don't know.

38:33.995 --> 38:35.519
What have I done?

38:40.501 --> 38:43.197
Carol, what's going on in here?

38:43.404 --> 38:44.234
You all right?

38:44.438 --> 38:45.905
Yeah, we're fine.

38:46.107 --> 38:49.133
We need Mark, though.
Can you get Mark?

38:49.343 --> 38:51.834
Yes. Dr. Greene, please.

38:52.046 --> 38:55.675
- Sure, I can do that.
- And Security. PTSD.

38:59.653 --> 39:01.621
You've got a big cut on your leg.

39:02.623 --> 39:04.454
I ran away.

39:07.628 --> 39:10.222
Oh, God!

39:42.229 --> 39:44.220
I thought I'd find you up here.

39:45.199 --> 39:47.429
How is she doing?

39:47.868 --> 39:50.234
She's fine. Sedated.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.851
So I spoke to Anspaugh...

40:11.792 --> 40:13.589
...told him I was quitting.

40:13.794 --> 40:14.886
What did he say?

40:15.429 --> 40:18.523
Well, he was polite enough
not to burst into song.

40:19.567 --> 40:21.057
Didn't try and talk me out of it.

40:21.268 --> 40:22.963
Well, did you expect him to?

40:23.170 --> 40:24.398
No.

40:28.375 --> 40:31.071
Julian in Genetics stood up for me
with the cops.

40:31.512 --> 40:32.501
And?

40:33.681 --> 40:35.512
They're not gonna prosecute.

40:35.950 --> 40:37.975
- That's great.
- Yeah.

40:45.326 --> 40:46.987
Long night, huh?

40:49.864 --> 40:51.126
Yep.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.694
You're not coming with me, are you?

40:57.238 --> 40:59.229
Are you really leaving?

41:02.743 --> 41:04.574
There's nothing for me here.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.574
I'm here.

41:08.849 --> 41:10.612
I mean work.

41:11.986 --> 41:13.248
I can't stay here.

41:14.088 --> 41:15.555
Not even for me?

41:15.956 --> 41:17.184
Come with me.

41:18.292 --> 41:20.419
I want you to stay here.

41:22.530 --> 41:23.758
I can't.

41:27.034 --> 41:29.832
I don't understand that.

41:31.972 --> 41:33.940
I have to go, Carol.

41:37.344 --> 41:38.834
I can't stay here.

41:50.958 --> 41:51.788
Doug?

41:56.530 --> 41:59.499
I don't want
to wake up alone tomorrow.

42:17.551 --> 42:18.984
I love you.

43:00.861 --> 43:02.795
Now, this is living.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.989
Brown-bagging it on the lake
in February.

43:06.533 --> 43:09.058
If this isn't the coldest place,
I don't know what is.

43:09.270 --> 43:10.737
It was your idea to come out here.

43:10.938 --> 43:14.066
Just reminding myself why I'm
happy to get out of here.

43:17.878 --> 43:20.312
You're not gonna become a
Trailblazers fan, are you?

43:20.514 --> 43:23.813
Maybe. Or the Sonics.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.747
That's just wrong.

43:26.854 --> 43:27.980
Seahawks?

43:28.188 --> 43:29.985
I don't know, maybe.

43:32.793 --> 43:35.318
Doesn't it rain 300 days
a year out there?

43:36.397 --> 43:38.865
Save me a lot of money
watering my lawn.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.933
You don't have a lawn.

43:56.417 --> 43:58.783
- Play some hoops?
- Sure.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.353
Come on.

44:01.822 --> 44:03.722
- You know what I'll miss?
- What?

44:03.924 --> 44:05.789
Whipping your ass on the court.

44:05.993 --> 44:07.119
Oh, right.

44:07.328 --> 44:10.593
- I don't think I ever lost a game.
- In your dreams.

44:10.931 --> 44:13.263
- Play for a buck a point?
- Hell, no.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.160
You scared?

44:15.369 --> 44:18.896
- No. You cheat.
- I do not.

44:19.106 --> 44:19.936
- You do.
- I do not.

44:20.140 --> 44:21.801
You're a cheater.
