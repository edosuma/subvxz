01:55.716 --> 02:00.252
<i>My mama had always told me
that my papa was an astronaut.</i>

02:00.254 --> 02:02.788
<i>He was on a long voyage
to Mars and back,</i>

02:02.790 --> 02:04.823
<i>and that one day soon,
he'd return.</i>

02:07.761 --> 02:09.595
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

02:09.597 --> 02:11.196
<i>Get up, get dressed,</i>

02:11.198 --> 02:12.498
<i>get ready for chow.</i>

02:16.437 --> 02:19.271
<i>I was sad that he was gone,
and didn't understand</i>

02:19.273 --> 02:20.739
<i>why he'd leave me and my mama.</i>

02:30.451 --> 02:32.518
<i>If you had given me
a million years to ponder,</i>

02:32.520 --> 02:34.786
<i>I'd never guess
that the trip he was on</i>

02:34.788 --> 02:38.624
<i>wasn't through the vastness
of space in a tiny capsule,</i>

02:38.626 --> 02:42.461
<i>but in a 6-by-11 cell,
here in the great state of California.</i>

02:44.665 --> 02:47.833
<i>For two whole years,
he missed me grow up,</i>

02:47.835 --> 02:50.169
<i>not by choice, but by design.</i>

02:52.206 --> 02:57.242
<i>But then, one lucky day in December
of my eighth year on this world,</i>

02:57.244 --> 02:59.511
<i>he came home.</i>

02:59.513 --> 03:01.914
<i>And even now, looking back
through all the chaos</i>

03:01.916 --> 03:05.484
<i>and violence of that day,
through all the blood and carnage,</i>

03:05.486 --> 03:08.687
<i>it seems little more
than a distant dream.</i>

03:08.689 --> 03:12.391
<i>One, two, zero,
18, 14, roll it up.</i>

03:13.928 --> 03:15.861
<i>But the dream
was really happening,</i>

03:15.863 --> 03:18.630
<i>and it was to change
the path of my life forever.</i>

04:13.821 --> 04:15.621
What would you like to do first?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.298
Yes!

04:28.669 --> 04:30.269
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- Oh, my God.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.376
Ohh!
Oh, oh, oh!

04:38.312 --> 04:39.878
Okay.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.284
Oh, baby.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.689
Oh, baby,
I missed you so fucking much.

04:51.892 --> 04:52.991
I missed you.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.994
I missed you so much.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.568
<i>Air France Flight 66,
now arriving</i>

05:03.570 --> 05:05.003
<i>from Paris Charles de Gaulle.</i>

05:07.641 --> 05:08.740
Next.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.845
Purpose for coming to the United States,
Mr. Chaltiel?

05:13.847 --> 05:16.648
Uh... Business...

05:17.384 --> 05:19.084
Pleasure...

05:19.086 --> 05:21.620
Well, which one is it?

05:22.389 --> 05:24.556
A little bit of both.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.359
I take pleasure in my business.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.027
And what kind of business
are you in?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.863
Retirement planning.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.634
Is there a problem, Officer?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.103
According to the computer,
you were recently removed

05:38.105 --> 05:40.038
from an INTERPOL no-fly list.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.974
It was a computer error.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.944
It made my life a living hell.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.480
I know what you mean.
We had a 10-year-old kid

05:48.482 --> 05:50.415
show up
on our watch list yesterday.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.684
Still, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you to...

05:56.490 --> 05:59.858
Welcome to the United States, Mr. Chaltiel.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.793
Next.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.429
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

06:04.431 --> 06:06.498
You really had a lot stored up.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.767
I don't think I've ever
seen so much in one time.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.769
Well, I hope you've never seen
more than that at one time.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.571
It was two years' worth.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.639
- It must've been a full liter.
- Yeah, well,

06:14.641 --> 06:17.743
I did think about you
every day and every night.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.478
Oh, that's so sweet.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.515
And also... kind of gross.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.884
Next time, just use your hand.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.453
There's not going to be
a next time, honeybun.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.688
There better not be...

06:30.491 --> 06:32.724
Redmond, no more shortcuts.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.795
You have too much to lose, okay?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.698
Baby.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.067
Please think of me.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.736
More importantly,
think of your daughter.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.472
Honeybun, you and Bumble Bea
are all I think about.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.040
<i>- Je t'aime.</i>
- Me, too.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.444
Papa! Papa! Papa!

06:52.446 --> 06:54.613
Sweet Bumble Bea,
look how big you are!

06:57.951 --> 06:59.718
I missed you so much.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.097
I don't know what you just said,
Bumble Bea.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.799
When did you start
speaking such good French?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.634
You've been away for two years.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.769
And she didn't exactly
take it well.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.471
I put her in a <i> lycée français</i>,

07:19.473 --> 07:22.841
and now she refuses
to speak anything but French.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.676
You only speak French now,
Bumble Bea?

07:24.678 --> 07:28.213
<i>- Oui.</i>
- You don't want to speak English with Papa?

07:28.215 --> 07:29.581
<i>Non.</i>

07:29.583 --> 07:30.715
That was English.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.854
But we don't live in France.
We live in America.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.055
People speak English here.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.524
Blah!

07:41.028 --> 07:43.061
- Beatrice.
- I think I understood that one.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.034
So, this is my real punishment.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.869
You did this to yourself.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.971
Hey, welcome back.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.208
- Lolita. So good to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.587
Oh, Bumble Bea,
I'll be out in a second.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.589
- Welcome back.
- Good to see you, Lolita.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.961
- Uh, Honeybun?
- Hm?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.530
Is it just me,
or did you teach our Mexican nanny

08:18.532 --> 08:20.699
to speak better French
than I do?

08:20.701 --> 08:23.602
First of all,
Lolita is like family,

08:23.604 --> 08:25.136
and we barely have any money,

08:25.138 --> 08:27.706
so she stayed
in exchange for learning French.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.074
And she loves Beatrice.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.909
Second of all,

08:30.911 --> 08:32.544
you don't speak any French.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.546
Well, I don't need
to speak any French.

08:34.548 --> 08:38.149
- I speak the language of love.
- Oh. Very fluent, then.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.018
Mmm!

09:25.799 --> 09:26.831
Hey!

09:28.936 --> 09:30.168
Dickwad!

09:31.972 --> 09:34.039
That's my car
you're breaking into.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.643
No, my friend.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.079
You are mistaken.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.749
This is my car.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.718
Like hell it is, Frenchy.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.120
You think I don't have eyes?
Huh? I'll call the cops.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.656
You...

09:52.059 --> 09:53.224
You're a car thief.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.294
I am not a car thief.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.210
I am much worse.

10:30.864 --> 10:34.132
♪ <i>You are the one
you make it happen</i> ♪

10:41.675 --> 10:45.110
♪ <i>You're going to make a stand
Make a stand</i> ♪

♪ <i>Ba-la ba-lap

11:19.413 --> 11:20.979
- Hey.
- Whoo!

11:24.317 --> 11:26.351
Damn, son.
Check out my boy.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.820
Park this car for me.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.889
- Damn.
- Motherfucker just gave me the key.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.131
Whoo-whoo!

11:34.094 --> 11:36.227
You know what they say
about men from Montreal, right?

11:36.229 --> 11:39.831
No. What do they say?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.733
No, please!

11:41.735 --> 11:45.704
- I paid everything. I paid all my...
- Relax.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.205
I'm not here for you.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.440
You're not?

11:51.745 --> 11:52.844
No.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.980
See?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.348
No use in being afraid.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.317
If I was...

12:00.754 --> 12:02.287
you would already be dead.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.857
Yeah.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.892
I guess...
I guess that's true.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.932
It's a metaphor.
He's not talking about... dead people.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.901
Um...

12:16.903 --> 12:18.269
For a moment...

12:18.271 --> 12:20.038
You got me for a moment
you know?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.841
A slight moment,
I thought I was being retired.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.209
But...

12:24.211 --> 12:25.310
Not yet.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.213
Not yet.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.148
Okay.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.283
But if they do
send me for you...

12:33.887 --> 12:36.354
I will do it
so you do not see it coming.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.225
I will make it painless.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.495
Okay.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.432
I don't know what to say.

12:48.835 --> 12:49.934
Thank you.

12:49.936 --> 12:54.539
But, then, why the visit?
I mean, usually they don't send you unless...

12:54.541 --> 12:57.142
I'm in town
on personal business.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.310
I need some...

12:59.946 --> 13:01.279
tools.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.183
Why didn't you
say it immediately?

13:05.185 --> 13:09.254
Tools! Man, yeah!
You've come to the right place. Tools!

13:09.256 --> 13:12.056
Because I'm his tool guy.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.225
That's why he came to me.
Hey.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.328
Yeah! Let's go up to the roof.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.465
Let's... I'm his tool guy.

13:21.802 --> 13:22.901
No.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.302
The ladies.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.072
There you go,<i> mec.</i>
The finest firepower

13:28.074 --> 13:29.307
French South-Central
has to offer.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.509
All clean serial numbers.

13:31.511 --> 13:35.814
The only handguns you have...
are GLOCKs?

13:35.816 --> 13:39.384
Yeah, I know, I know. These fucking
gangbangers, they just want GLOCKs, you know?

13:39.386 --> 13:42.253
I try to carry a variety,
but they just want GLOCKs, GLOCKs, GLOCKs.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.889
"Hey, I want me
a motherfucking GLOCK, yo."

13:44.891 --> 13:47.959
I gave in to market pressure.
Now, it's the only handgun I carry.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.962
The GLOCKs are
<i>de la merde</i> at long range.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.364
You have detonator
for the C-4?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.466
Yeah, sure,
whatever you want. Yeah.

13:56.870 --> 14:00.405
Oh, yeah,
that's a fine weapon for sniping.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.309
Um, the silencer
is whisper-quiet.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.945
That's a... It's 25-times scope.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.880
It's night vision.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.215
It's...

14:11.151 --> 14:12.483
night vision capable.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.019
What... What are you doing?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.030
Fuck!

14:30.203 --> 14:32.003
It pulls to the left.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.073
If you say so.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.511
I'll take the SIG Sauer,

14:41.147 --> 14:43.147
two MAC-11's,

14:43.149 --> 14:44.582
the MK9...

14:46.119 --> 14:47.886
the Benelli...

14:47.888 --> 14:50.088
- Okay.
- ...two GLOCKs <i> de merde</i>...

14:50.090 --> 14:52.023
- ammunition...
- Fine.

14:52.025 --> 14:55.660
- ...eight ounces of C-4 with four detonators.
- Sure.

14:55.662 --> 14:59.163
I also want that girl
you were talking to.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.399
What? Sabine?

15:03.003 --> 15:04.135
She's my girlfriend.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.274
And what is mine is yours.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.476
<i>Mec.</i>

15:37.203 --> 15:38.937
Mm.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.240
It's familiar.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.641
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.543
I wanted to channel
your experience.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.147
That's...
Yeah, that's what I looked at for two years.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.248
Do you like it?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.217
Yeah. Yeah.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.019
Of course. It's...

15:55.021 --> 15:59.524
- It just really captures the...
- Ennui?

15:59.526 --> 16:03.294
Exactly, exactly.
This thing is dripping in ennui.

16:03.296 --> 16:07.165
I want the viewers to feel the jaded
Brechtian ennui of confinement

16:07.167 --> 16:11.235
that contrasts the luxurious
debauchery of vapid freedom.

16:11.237 --> 16:15.606
Well, I'll take "luxurious debauchery"
and "vapid freedom" any day.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.742
I used real cinder blocks
to texturize it

16:17.744 --> 16:20.678
and the same lead paint
that they used at your jail.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.414
Mm, well,
the devil is in the detail.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.218
Honeybun,
I sincerely hope

16:27.220 --> 16:30.088
that you sell
every single one of these,

16:30.090 --> 16:32.256
because I don't know if I want
them hanging in our house.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.591
You shouldn't say that.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.361
This one's not for the show.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.029
It's for you.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.231
I think I'm going to hang it
above our bed.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.332
You know, I'm kidding.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.002
I love anything you make.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.204
I should be lucky
to sell anything at all.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.439
It really has been hard
since you left.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.475
I had to use almost
every dime of our savings

16:50.477 --> 16:52.777
to pay for
Beatrice's education.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.545
It's been very stressful.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.148
Don't you worry, all right?
Papa will provide.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.716
- Oh, really?
- Really, really.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.551
How?

17:00.553 --> 17:04.188
I've got a little rainy-day
stash hidden away.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.258
You're such an outlaw.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.560
No, I'm not, not anymore.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.662
I've got you and Bumble Bea
to take care of.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.334
- So, when's the show?
- Tonight.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.569
Tonight? Tonight?
Today's tonight? Tonight today?

17:19.071 --> 17:20.704
Today, tonight. Yes.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.807
I just got out of the joint,

17:22.809 --> 17:27.111
and I'm, like, I'm really freaked
out by the largeness of the world.

17:27.113 --> 17:30.815
I was hoping we could maybe stay
in and watch a movie or something.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.150
Or something?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.085
Yeah.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.055
Honestly,
I haven't seen a movie in two years.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.358
The dayroom TV was just
permanently shitty sitcoms

17:40.360 --> 17:44.529
and fuckin <i>America's Dumbest</i> videos,
and it did my head in.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.365
Seven o'clock.
Lolita will be watching Beatrice.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.569
I've been working on this for ten months.
It's very important to me.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.338
It would be very important
for me to have you there.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.140
Of course,
I'm going to be there.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.479
And maybe when we get back home, we can...
do something.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.481
If you're good.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.284
But when I'm bad I'm better.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.853
That's true.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.555
Honeybun, I'm gonna
go head down to the shop

18:10.557 --> 18:12.557
and see how badly
Leroy screwed things up.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.492
- Seven o'clock. I love you.
- Love you.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.263
Oh, Fuck!
That's a big fucking dick!

18:19.265 --> 18:25.570
Fuck! Fuck! Oh, give me that dick!
I want your dick, ohh!

18:25.572 --> 18:28.473
You're just gonna let him
humiliate you like this?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.109
What am I supposed to do?

18:31.111 --> 18:34.412
I would kill the bastard
if he did that to my woman.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.281
- In front of you.
- Yeah. In front of you,

18:37.283 --> 18:40.351
as if he's slapping his dick
in your cuckold face.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.353
Fuck the two of you, okay?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.422
Don't you know who that is?

18:44.424 --> 18:45.790
I don't know and I don't care.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.559
Let me kill him for you.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.795
He cannot be killed.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.332
This is Luc Chaltiel, okay?
They call him the Terminator,

18:54.334 --> 18:56.634
because once he's after you
nothing can stop him.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.369
He's like a fucking robot.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.505
He is terminating
your girlfriend's pussy.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.606
You don't get it.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.275
He's crazy.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.478
I am crazy, okay?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.581
But he is crazier!

19:11.451 --> 19:13.251
Did you hear the way he speaks?

19:13.253 --> 19:15.887
You heard his accent?
You know why he speaks that way?

19:15.889 --> 19:19.824
Because he thinks he's French.
Get it?

19:19.826 --> 19:24.362
So better give him whatever he
wants and live to tell the tale.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.198
Chaltiel?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.501
Didn't he have a brother?

19:30.503 --> 19:34.305
Yeah, he did. Killed by the cops.
And they say that's when he...

19:34.307 --> 19:36.541
went nuts, over the deep end.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.412
Now he handles "retirements"
for the Connection.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.448
So just be quiet.

19:44.450 --> 19:47.451
Be nice with him. Huh?

19:47.453 --> 19:51.289
Take a chill pill and don't
rub his fur the wrong way.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.823
Okay?

19:52.825 --> 19:54.692
Baby, yes!

19:54.694 --> 19:57.195
Cum in my mouth!
Cum in my fucking mouth

19:57.197 --> 19:59.497
with that massive fucking dick!

19:59.499 --> 20:02.733
I think they might
be finishing up now?

20:03.937 --> 20:05.937
I would, at least,
consider killing her.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.241
Hey!

20:13.446 --> 20:15.313
Get rid of this for me.

20:23.590 --> 20:27.625
Ohh.
My favorite song.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.256
Jacques, Daniels!

21:02.762 --> 21:07.898
Are you going to introduce me
to your little friends?

21:08.434 --> 21:10.368
Yeah, sure. Um...

21:10.370 --> 21:12.303
This is Pierre,
and this is Louis.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.338
- Guys, this is Luc.
- Oh!

21:15.708 --> 21:20.745
Jacques, you did not tell me
you are running a gay bar.

21:22.415 --> 21:25.283
They're not gay, Luc.
They help me with imports.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.786
They look like
they prefer penis to vagina.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.056
You...

21:32.058 --> 21:33.791
look like the pitcher.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.528
And you look like the catcher.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.665
So, Luc? Uh...

21:44.304 --> 21:45.803
Where's Sabine?

21:45.805 --> 21:48.706
- Who?
- Sabine, my girlfriend.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.374
The one you just fucked
in the toilet.

21:50.376 --> 21:51.876
Oh, her.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.078
Yes.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.949
I cut her throat
when I came to an orgasm.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.785
What?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.420
It avoids

22:02.422 --> 22:06.324
all the uncomfortable
post-coital talk

22:06.326 --> 22:09.393
that is inevitable.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.429
It is cleaner this way.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.701
You...

22:16.703 --> 22:18.869
motherfucking dog!

22:26.779 --> 22:29.080
<i>Excusez-moi?</i>

22:29.082 --> 22:31.048
I don't care who you are.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.920
You come in here, insult us,

22:35.922 --> 22:40.691
fuck and kill his girlfriend,
and then expect...

22:48.134 --> 22:49.900
I expect nothing.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.436
Do you expect something?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.605
Uh... No.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.848
What I want to know is,

23:03.850 --> 23:05.483
did you know that Jacques here

23:05.485 --> 23:07.551
has been embezzling
the Connection?

23:08.788 --> 23:11.088
If no, I let you live.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.661
I just do collections.

23:41.454 --> 23:42.553
Here.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.586
A little higher.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.029
Mmm, to the left.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.964
Mm, I was wrong.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.599
Lower.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.635
Blah!

23:57.637 --> 23:58.769
No, no.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.539
Higher.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.942
No, it's here. Here.
Hm, eh.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.145
No. Lower.

24:10.183 --> 24:12.516
That's enough.
Enough, enough. Enough, enough.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.789
No, down.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.958
Yes.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.627
- I don't know...
- Opening night jitters?

24:24.096 --> 24:25.863
Is it that obvious?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.865
The painting
will be hung perfectly.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.733
- That's all. Take five.
- Oh...

24:29.735 --> 24:32.670
- No, but it's not up yet...
- The painting is perfect.

24:32.672 --> 24:36.240
The opening is going to be
perfect and you are perfect.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.909
You're going to sell
every piece.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.011
- I really hope so.
- Blah!

24:41.013 --> 24:42.746
Hm.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.883
Charming child.
Come with me, Chloé.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.985
I want to have
a private word. Come.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.254
It's not put up.
I need it to be perfect before the show.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.956
- Blah!
- Oh, Beatrice.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.558
Isn't she having fun?

24:55.161 --> 24:56.927
Too much fun, unfortunately.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.230
- Is something the matter, Mr. Blarney?
- Please...

24:59.232 --> 25:01.165
We have been working together
long enough.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.067
You can call me Derrek.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.135
Okay, Derrek.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.271
Is something wrong?

25:08.174 --> 25:10.908
Since you came into my life,
Chloé, no.

25:11.511 --> 25:12.910
Nothing could ever be wrong.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.213
In fact, these last months...

25:17.216 --> 25:18.849
preparing for the show with you,

25:19.218 --> 25:21.752
working hand in hand,

25:21.754 --> 25:24.054
have been some of the happiest
of my life.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.656
Oh. Um...

25:28.661 --> 25:30.628
I love you, Chloé.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.031
I can't repress
these feelings anymore.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.166
Damn being professional!
Damn it all to hell!

25:36.168 --> 25:39.236
- I have to have you.
- My daughter is here and I'm married.

25:39.238 --> 25:43.207
He doesn't love you. No man who truly
loves a woman as incredible as you

25:43.209 --> 25:45.943
would leave you for two years
for something as petty as work.

25:45.945 --> 25:50.180
I know I wouldn't. I would burn
this gallery to the ground for you.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.182
- To the ground!
- That's a little dramatic.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.785
And as for Beatrice, well,
she hardly knows the man.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.953
She can live with us.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.121
Mr. Blarney...

25:57.123 --> 25:59.657
- Derrek.
- I am married.

25:59.659 --> 26:04.028
- I love my husband.
- The fool has had his chance, now it's mine.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.763
He doesn't even have to know.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.932
It can be
an <i> affaire d'amour</i> secret.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.934
I'll settle for hidden love.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.937
Oh!

26:12.939 --> 26:16.173
Make love to me,
my French kitten!

26:16.175 --> 26:18.309
Mr. Blarney, control yourself.

26:18.311 --> 26:21.812
No, no.
No. It feels so good

26:21.814 --> 26:24.782
to finally end
this lie I've been living.

26:24.784 --> 26:29.019
Seeing you, smelling you.
You have no idea the restraint I've used.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.854
No, and I don't want to know.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.122
I have a husband.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.058
And he did not leave us
for work.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.726
The truth is he...

26:35.728 --> 26:36.860
just got out of prison.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.364
Prison?

26:40.366 --> 26:42.032
- What do you mean, "prison"?
- Yes.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.334
He's a criminal.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.669
A hardened criminal.

26:45.671 --> 26:48.238
But you said,
and I quote,

26:48.240 --> 26:49.807
your husband
"was transferred upstate."

26:49.809 --> 26:51.175
He was.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.043
You said, again, I quote,

26:53.045 --> 26:55.279
"He left us alone and having
to fend for ourselves."

26:55.281 --> 26:57.014
What is this?
An inquisition?

26:57.016 --> 26:59.136
- Yes or no? Answer the question!
- Well, it was true.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.352
At the time, it was true.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.787
I don't know what else to tell you,
Mr. Blarney.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.223
But if you lay
a single finger on me,

27:06.225 --> 27:07.324
my husband, he...

27:08.995 --> 27:10.294
he is a very possessive man.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.229
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm. Yes, he is.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.264
He can be very dangerous.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.368
So, I think it's best if we
just forget this ever happened.

27:18.704 --> 27:21.372
I really hope this has no
effect on the show tonight.

27:21.374 --> 27:24.942
- So that's how it is.
- What is?

27:24.944 --> 27:28.345
I've extended
not just my heart to you,

27:28.347 --> 27:30.247
but all of
my professional resources.

27:30.249 --> 27:34.118
I see now
that I have been led on.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.919
- Played...
- No, it's not like this.

27:35.921 --> 27:38.188
I'm very fond of you.
And I'm very grateful

27:38.190 --> 27:41.125
for all of the help and support
that the gallery has given me,

27:41.127 --> 27:43.827
but we must
keep things professional.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.929
Can he support you, Chloé?

27:45.931 --> 27:47.765
Without resorting to crime,
of course.

27:48.934 --> 27:52.336
Can he clothe
your beautiful daughter?

27:52.838 --> 27:54.104
Feed you?

27:54.106 --> 27:55.305
Shelter you?

27:55.307 --> 27:58.042
Offer you a life, a real life,

27:58.044 --> 28:01.445
with success and fame?

28:01.447 --> 28:04.782
Most of all, will he be there?

28:09.689 --> 28:11.529
I'm going to go home
and get ready.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.458
And I'm going to pretend
this never happened.

28:14.460 --> 28:19.163
Prison or no, he left you once,
that's who he is.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.432
He will leave you again.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.870
Have you closely read your
contract with my gallery?

28:26.872 --> 28:31.842
Your retainer is in the form
of a short-term loan.

28:31.844 --> 28:37.081
If the said loan is not covered
within 48 hours after... the show,

28:37.083 --> 28:39.750
I will be well within my rights
to foreclose.

28:39.752 --> 28:40.884
Please don't do this.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.419
We're broke.

28:42.421 --> 28:46.023
I've been living off of
that money for over a year.

28:46.025 --> 28:49.059
Coincidentally,
the same year your husband was gone.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.297
If you walk out that door,

28:54.433 --> 28:58.802
I will,
per the terms of your contract,

28:58.804 --> 29:04.341
exercise my option to take
"adversarial possession."

29:06.178 --> 29:09.780
You better pay up or pray
you sell your paintings.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.250
If...

29:16.489 --> 29:18.355
If you walk out that door.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.527
Hm?

29:39.211 --> 29:40.778
Ah.

30:18.317 --> 30:25.317

30:46.579 --> 30:49.246
Honey, I'm home.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.916
The man has returned!

30:54.286 --> 30:55.385
G'day, mate.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.857
What's happening, babe?

30:59.859 --> 31:01.258
- Good to see you, mate.
- You too, man.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.426
Thanks for taking care
of everything.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.328
You know I got you, brother.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.630
Hey, listen,
I just want you to know

31:06.632 --> 31:09.566
that I will reciprocate for that one,
man, that should've been me.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.201
Nah,
it's a quick two minutes.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.303
No, still,
you had more to lose than I did.

31:13.305 --> 31:16.240
Chloé, Bea.
I held down your house for you,

31:16.242 --> 31:17.574
but I still owe you
for that one, man.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.243
All that time you lost. Shit.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.612
Like, for real, I'd...

31:21.614 --> 31:23.013
I'd take a bullet for you, man.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.181
No, mate, don't say that.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.582
You got an open ticket with me.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.317
Thanks, mate.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.189
- Shop looks good.
- Yeah.

31:32.524 --> 31:33.657
Oh, I...

31:34.960 --> 31:36.226
Actually, there is...

31:36.228 --> 31:39.663
- one thing I wanted to ask you.
- Say the word, man.

31:40.532 --> 31:41.632
How come...

31:46.205 --> 31:48.639
Why didn't you come and visit me
when I was in there?

31:50.242 --> 31:52.009
Uh...

31:52.444 --> 31:54.478
Yeah, um, I...

31:55.481 --> 31:56.680
I just...

32:01.287 --> 32:03.620
I wasn't trying to see you
in no cage, man.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.645
Yeah, I wouldn't want to see
you in one either, mate.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.262
You're a good friend, Leroy.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.197
Yeah, about that...

32:14.199 --> 32:16.199
- I don't go by Leroy no more.
- Really?

32:16.201 --> 32:18.568
- No, man. I changed my name a year ago.
- To what?

32:18.938 --> 32:20.404
Le Roi.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.040
- It's the same thing.
- No, it ain't.

32:23.042 --> 32:27.511
It's spelled L-E space R-O-I,
like, "the king" in French.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.280
Franco-phonetically speaking,
it should be pronounced <i> le roi</i>,

32:30.282 --> 32:32.482
but I'm ain't trying
to confuse nobody, not me.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.217
- Get out.
- I know, right.

32:34.219 --> 32:36.320
Fucking Le Roi, man.
How cool is that?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.355
You can't honestly
be expecting people

32:38.357 --> 32:40.991
to walk around
and call you "the king."

32:40.993 --> 32:43.293
But it ain't "the king."
It's Le Roi.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.262
Yeah, not to anyone
who speaks French.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.631
Look, Chloé's down with it.
Everybody calls me Le Roi now.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.732
So I'm just saying.

32:48.734 --> 32:49.733
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.068
Yeah, well, not me.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.502
To me you're "Leroy."

32:52.504 --> 32:55.072
Why you gotta
be like that, Red?

32:55.074 --> 32:57.341
Imagine if I started
calling myself "Rouge."

32:57.343 --> 32:59.676
You're using the French pronunciation.
I told you it's confusing.

32:59.678 --> 33:03.480
Now, if they called you "Rogue"
that would be cool, right?

33:03.482 --> 33:04.581
No, it's not.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.516
It was Chloé's idea, man.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.687
Ernesto,
what a delightful surprise.

33:10.689 --> 33:14.992
Surprise, my ass.
You're on supervised probation, dickwad.

33:14.994 --> 33:18.295
You check in with me
and only me.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.363
I was going to.

33:19.365 --> 33:20.464
It's been what?

33:21.066 --> 33:22.666
Four hours?

33:22.668 --> 33:26.103
I mean, can I have a chance
to see my family, my friend,

33:26.105 --> 33:28.271
take a shit,
breathe some free air?

33:28.273 --> 33:30.774
Free air ain't something
you gonna get from me, scumbag.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.609
I'm gonna choke you
day in and day out.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.012
You gonna wish
you was back in the hole.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.714
I still can't fucking believe they
let your squirrelly ass walk.

33:37.716 --> 33:41.585
Motherfucking 50-50 time.

33:41.587 --> 33:45.088
If that was up to me,
you'd have done a full nickel.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.257
Good thing it's not up to you.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.227
Can it, jungle monkey.
I'll dig up some shit on your black ass,

33:50.229 --> 33:52.596
bust you down so hard,
you'll be calling me "Massah."

33:53.332 --> 33:55.232
- Leroy.
- It's "Le Roi."

33:55.234 --> 33:57.234
May I introduce
my parole officer,

33:57.236 --> 34:00.470
the ever-charming
Ernesto Sanchez?

34:00.472 --> 34:02.572
Up against the wall.

34:02.574 --> 34:05.214
You, you put your hands right there,
where I can see them.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.679
Go on, you know the drill.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.552
That's right,
very good, you still remember.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.824
You might as well tell me now
'cause I will find them.

34:21.827 --> 34:25.128
And I will nail you
for it when I do.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.396
You got anything on you?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.665
- No.
- No? You packing a piece?

34:28.667 --> 34:30.600
- No.
- No? You got any smack, pot,

34:30.601 --> 34:32.601
crack, meth,
controlled narcotics?

34:32.603 --> 34:34.638
- No.
- Any benzodiazepines?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.072
OxyContin?

34:37.443 --> 34:39.109
Unprescribed pharmaceuticals?

34:39.277 --> 34:40.377
No, sir.

34:41.547 --> 34:42.679
Ooh.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.283
Fill this.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.822
Test dirty, you're going back.

34:51.824 --> 34:54.324
Seriously, man. He just got out.
You think he's using?

34:54.326 --> 34:56.659
I don't know
what to think, sambo.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.262
Your friend here has a history
with a heroin problem.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.231
Hey, that was
a long time ago.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.799
I was a kid.
I didn't have a family then.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.668
That didn't keep you
from pulling off that gig,

35:04.670 --> 35:06.403
busting that bank vault again.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.105
It wasn't a bank.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.309
It was an investment banking firm,
you know that.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.177
And they're the real
fucking criminals, anyway.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.413
I was essentially
stealing stolen money.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.648
Grand theft is grand theft.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.250
Unless it's <i> Grand Theft Auto.</i>

35:21.386 --> 35:22.486
What'd you say?

35:22.488 --> 35:24.321
It's an inside joke.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.860
This is the whole shop?
All this?

35:30.596 --> 35:33.263
Yeah. What you see
is what you get.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.699
Yeah. It's not much
but it's home to us.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.135
Frankly, I just can't believe
that the court

35:38.137 --> 35:41.438
let you keep this
sorry excuse for a shop.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.873
It's a legitimate business.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.642
Are you a dissenter?

35:46.178 --> 35:47.744
Am I at the center?

35:47.746 --> 35:49.513
- Yeah, I'd like to think so.
- No.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.915
Are you a dissenter?
Dissenter?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.817
Do you mean to cause dissent?

35:53.819 --> 35:55.886
I just misunderstood
what you said, man.

35:56.722 --> 35:59.189
Well, don't misunderstand this.

35:59.191 --> 36:02.359
Fuck you! And keep
that cocksucker of yours shut

36:02.361 --> 36:04.794
'cause I will fill it up
with dicks.

36:04.796 --> 36:09.332
Now, I know you're into
some stinky shit, fire-crotch.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.202
And I'm gonna be watching you.

36:12.204 --> 36:16.640
You make one misstep
and that's a parole violation,

36:16.642 --> 36:18.708
and that makes me
motherfucking happy,

36:18.710 --> 36:22.312
'cause I get to send you upstate
and forget about you.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.949
So no drugs, no guns.
No bitch-ass infractions. You got that?

36:28.187 --> 36:29.219
I got that.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.954
Who's the man?

36:30.956 --> 36:33.957
- You're the man.
- That's right. Because I got the badge.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.427
And all you got
is five years' parole.

36:38.463 --> 36:39.829
That's a long time, Red.

36:39.831 --> 36:44.301
It's going to be hard for a guy
like you to stay clean that long.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.236
You're gonna fuck up.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.274
When you least expect it,
I'm gonna be there.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.578
Have a wonderful day, Sanchez.

36:54.947 --> 36:56.413
Fuck you!

37:00.485 --> 37:04.588
It took every
last ounce of my strength

37:04.590 --> 37:06.890
not to reciprocate
what I owe you

37:06.892 --> 37:09.859
by blowing that motherfucker
a new asshole between the eyes.

37:09.861 --> 37:13.630
<i>Namaste</i>
or the meditative restraint,

37:13.632 --> 37:16.900
but please don't worry about Sanchez,
all right?

37:16.902 --> 37:19.636
He's a cop.
Likes to hear himself talk, that's it.

37:19.638 --> 37:22.639
He lost his wife and kids a while ago.
That's why he so bloody mean.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.574
Anyway.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.943
A couple of years
of playing by the rules...

37:26.945 --> 37:29.579
...then I'm all good.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.986
- After you, sir.
- After you, bro.

37:35.988 --> 37:37.287
Thanks, mate.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.370
Check this out.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.772
What have you got? Ooh!

37:56.508 --> 37:57.841
<i>Romeo y Julieta.</i>

37:57.843 --> 37:59.542
I'm a sucker for a love story.

37:59.544 --> 38:00.910
Cheers, man.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.912
Relax. Kick your feet up.

38:06.818 --> 38:10.320
- It's good to be out.
- That's what I'm talking about.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.989
Acclimate yourself
to the good life again, bro.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.308
I like your ride.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.911
It is pimped. Yes?

38:40.352 --> 38:42.052
- Do you know who I am,<i> ese</i> ?
- No.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.765
I like your car.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.036
Let's see.

39:21.693 --> 39:22.792
So...

39:24.563 --> 39:25.662
Where are they?

39:25.664 --> 39:26.863
Fuck else?

39:26.998 --> 39:27.997
Big red.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.866
The old Krueger 88.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.035
That's the one safe
Houdini couldn't crack.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.803
Houdini didn't have
your skills, dawg.

39:33.805 --> 39:34.971
As far as I know,
you're the only dude

39:34.973 --> 39:36.539
to have cracked a Krueger 88.

39:36.541 --> 39:40.009
That was a long time ago,
and I got lucky.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.911
The tumblers hadn't been reset.
It was...

39:42.848 --> 39:44.781
That was more ass
than class, really.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.420
You gonna try it?

39:50.422 --> 39:54.057
- I'm rusty. I'm rusty.
- How are you gonna be in lockup

39:54.059 --> 39:56.025
and ain't take the opportunity
to practice on the locks?

39:56.027 --> 39:57.427
Ain't shit else to do.

40:00.465 --> 40:04.067
I promised Chloé one last score, okay?
That was the deal.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.469
But that's what you do, man.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.505
Birds gotta fly,
fish gotta swim.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.540
You gotta crack locks, bruh.
Do you?

40:11.810 --> 40:14.144
Come on, don't be a pussy.
You know you want to.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.048
All right.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.151
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

40:21.153 --> 40:24.087
If I'm gonna do this, I need silence.
Turn that music off.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.466
G'day.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.129
It's like...

41:06.131 --> 41:09.499
- Like watching fucking da Vinci paint.
- Shh.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.174
Come on, come on, come on.

41:24.549 --> 41:25.782
Fuck.

41:28.887 --> 41:32.155
Yeah. Ain't no thing.
Happens to everybody.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.726
Two years is a long time, man.
It'll come back to you.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.095
Yeah.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.635
Tell me you still got
that key.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.203
Shit, I've done carried
this damn key on me

41:47.205 --> 41:48.905
the whole time
you was inside, man.

41:49.241 --> 41:50.640
That's my man.

41:57.582 --> 41:59.148
There they are.

41:59.150 --> 42:02.952
Six hundred thousand
in 1933 US treasury notes.

42:05.624 --> 42:08.591
- The mother of all takes.
- You know what you're gonna do with your half?

42:10.629 --> 42:14.030
I was in that shithole
for 730 days, and...

42:15.867 --> 42:18.301
I spent this money differently
every single day.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.602
But...

42:19.604 --> 42:23.006
And every day, I spent it
with Chloé and Bumble Bea.

42:23.975 --> 42:27.043
- I hear that.
- What about you?

42:27.045 --> 42:29.846
Mine's going straight to the
investment portfolio, you know?

42:29.848 --> 42:32.849
Low expense ratio,
passively managed index funds and shit.

42:32.851 --> 42:35.718
And to make sure my asset allocation
has global diversification,

42:35.720 --> 42:37.854
I'ma start a strip club.

42:37.856 --> 42:41.624
Wait.
Featuring bubble butts from every nation.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.793
Good to know it's going
back to the strippers.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.728
Hey, man,
I'm just trying to reciprocate.

42:46.932 --> 42:48.031
Right on, brother.

42:49.134 --> 42:50.800
So what you saying tonight, man?

42:52.771 --> 42:54.704
You wanna hit Jet Strip tonight?

42:54.706 --> 42:55.838
Scout some talent?

42:56.641 --> 43:00.343
I'd love to, mate, I would.
But, um...

43:00.345 --> 43:02.011
It's, uh...

43:02.013 --> 43:05.348
- It's Chloé's art show tonight.
- Oh, right.

43:05.350 --> 43:08.284
And I was just wondering,
well, um...

43:09.621 --> 43:12.221
- if you'd come with me.
- Me?

43:12.223 --> 43:15.692
Man, you know I can't stand
that bougie-ass gallery crowd.

43:15.694 --> 43:18.828
Pretentious, know-it-all,
flat-ass society motherfuckers.

43:18.830 --> 43:20.363
Get the fuck out of here
with that bullshit.

43:20.365 --> 43:22.131
You remember what happened
last time I went?

43:22.133 --> 43:24.701
Everyone remembers what happened
last time you went.

43:27.005 --> 43:30.039
- Seriously, man, I can't do it alone.
- You ain't alone. You got Chloé.

43:30.041 --> 43:32.141
She's gonna be off kissing
hands and shaking babies,

43:32.143 --> 43:34.863
and I'll be standing in the corner,
trying not to look like a convict.

43:39.184 --> 43:40.316
Please?

43:43.822 --> 43:47.223
- For our friendship?
- Shit, you really gonna play that card right now?

43:47.225 --> 43:48.658
It's the best card I got.

43:49.394 --> 43:50.860
You know I got you, brother.

43:51.296 --> 43:52.395
Thanks, mate.

43:54.666 --> 43:58.201
- Don't lose that key.
- No, man. I'm gonna keep that safe right here,

43:58.203 --> 43:59.769
right next to my heart.

44:17.055 --> 44:18.535
<i>Pull over the vehicle.</i>

44:24.029 --> 44:26.095
<i>Put your hands
where I can see 'em.</i>

44:39.978 --> 44:42.412
Are you fucking kidding me
with this shit?

44:43.181 --> 44:44.313
Hey!

44:44.315 --> 44:46.349
How may I help you, Officer?

44:46.351 --> 44:49.285
- It is not legal to drive like this.
- Like what?

44:49.287 --> 44:51.054
Lower the vehicle now.

44:51.056 --> 44:52.221
Ah.

44:52.957 --> 44:54.257
One moment.

44:55.060 --> 44:56.225
Let me see.

44:58.830 --> 44:59.996
Hey!

44:59.998 --> 45:01.130
Put that down.

45:13.244 --> 45:15.144
Unit 666 requesting backup.

45:23.988 --> 45:27.156
Officer down! Requesting backup.
Officer down!

45:45.143 --> 45:46.242
Officer down!

45:46.244 --> 45:47.410
We need backup.

45:50.849 --> 45:53.883
Radio this
to your little friends.

46:31.890 --> 46:32.989
Bang!

46:35.426 --> 46:37.794
You are dead.

46:37.796 --> 46:40.196
The Devil! The Devil!

46:43.268 --> 46:46.435
The Devil!

48:14.626 --> 48:16.125
Aww.

48:51.629 --> 48:53.129
I don't get it.

48:53.131 --> 48:54.297
We all give head.

48:58.703 --> 49:03.406
Pancho represents the oppression
in the justice system.

49:03.408 --> 49:06.208
Pancho must give head
because his life depends on it.

49:06.210 --> 49:07.543
Perhaps I get it too well.

49:12.550 --> 49:14.150
Your narrative is showing.

49:15.053 --> 49:16.152
Excuse me.

49:17.722 --> 49:19.288
I don't get it.

49:19.290 --> 49:22.058
I am definitely
not buying anything here.

49:22.060 --> 49:24.193
I just don't like it.

49:24.195 --> 49:26.362
I don't know what's worse,
the art or her outfit.

49:26.364 --> 49:30.466
I detest the entire
"minimalism as faux spiritualism" phenomenon.

49:30.468 --> 49:33.536
- What do you think?
- I think you're a fucking douchebag.

49:33.538 --> 49:36.706
Work clearly displays a capacity
for emotional loneliness.

49:36.708 --> 49:39.075
It has a cautionary subtext.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.743
As if you'd know.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.378
I'll have you know
that I've been collecting art

49:42.380 --> 49:44.246
since the early '90s.

49:44.248 --> 49:45.648
I have a Damien Hirst
in my collection

49:45.650 --> 49:47.650
as well as
an early Sarah Morris.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.552
So unless you have a Jeff
Koons shoved up your ass,

49:49.554 --> 49:52.054
I'd kindly invite you
to suck my balls.

49:52.056 --> 49:55.558
- This isn't an original.
- ...spent the last two years in a bathroom

49:55.560 --> 49:57.994
- rather than a prison.
- Oh, I've seen this.

49:57.996 --> 50:02.064
My dear, let me introduce you to
our most important Chinese buyer.

50:02.066 --> 50:05.267
- But I have to go...
- The reception to your work is on the fence.

50:05.269 --> 50:07.470
If you sell anything,
it will be because of me.

50:08.306 --> 50:09.739
Think about my offer.

50:09.741 --> 50:11.507
This is a woman
who's been left alone.

50:11.509 --> 50:13.142
Abandoned by her husband.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.211
Abused by the system.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.785
Whoa, slow down with that,
brother.

50:22.787 --> 50:25.321
This thing's
real important to Chloé.

50:25.323 --> 50:28.057
Uh, have you seen the people here, mate?
This is fucking bullshit.

50:28.059 --> 50:30.659
Yeah, I know,
but it kept her sane while you were inside.

50:30.661 --> 50:31.761
Gave her hope.

50:33.097 --> 50:35.131
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

50:35.666 --> 50:36.766
This is Ms. Kok.

50:38.036 --> 50:40.169
Ms. Kok,
pleasure to meet you.

50:40.171 --> 50:43.172
She flew in for the show
all the way from Beijing.

50:43.174 --> 50:47.076
- Oh.
- Congratulations! Your work is very interesting.

50:47.078 --> 50:48.310
Thank you.

50:48.312 --> 50:50.312
But we have many like it
in China.

50:50.314 --> 50:53.649
- Do you know the work of Chang Cheng?
- Um...

50:53.651 --> 50:59.789
I feel that your wall series is very
similar to his wall series from 1994.

50:59.791 --> 51:03.626
In fact, I've got three of those
hanging in my London apartment.

51:03.628 --> 51:07.129
Unfortunately,
they make a lot of bad replicas,

51:07.131 --> 51:08.564
available at the Silk Market.

51:08.566 --> 51:12.134
But yours looks like
fake Chang Cheng.

51:13.304 --> 51:15.471
- But a good fake.
- Mm.

51:17.208 --> 51:19.075
I don't know the work
of Mr. Chang Cheng,

51:19.077 --> 51:21.377
but if you can't
see the difference,

51:21.379 --> 51:23.345
then you also won't be able
to see the details.

51:23.347 --> 51:24.780
So it really doesn't matter.

51:25.516 --> 51:27.349
Have a safe trip
back to Beijing.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.687
Hottie!

51:32.423 --> 51:35.224
She is very innocent
and cute.

51:35.226 --> 51:37.526
- Artists!
- I see it in her work.

51:37.528 --> 51:41.130
It's like <i> One Wants to Fly
Over the Cuckoo's Hut.</i>

51:41.132 --> 51:44.433
- Yes.
- Almost retarded and spastic.

51:44.435 --> 51:45.668
- Oh, well, then you...
- Yes.

51:45.670 --> 51:47.369
You must buy a few then.

51:47.371 --> 51:49.538
Charity! Save the children!

51:50.641 --> 51:52.108
I'm so proud of her.

51:52.110 --> 51:53.242
Yeah, man.

51:53.611 --> 51:54.844
There she is.

51:54.846 --> 51:56.312
Congratulations!

51:56.881 --> 51:59.515
- It's a disaster.
- What?

51:59.517 --> 52:01.851
- There's so many people here.
- No.

52:01.853 --> 52:04.153
They're ripping me apart
like vultures.

52:04.155 --> 52:06.489
They're calling me
a hack and a thief.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.331
But that's my job
in the family.

52:09.660 --> 52:11.827
It's not funny.
They hate it.

52:11.829 --> 52:14.396
I'm sure it's not that bad.

52:14.398 --> 52:17.833
- I hate it.
- Yes, but is it even worth your hatred?

52:17.835 --> 52:19.535
- Oi!
- Ah...

52:19.537 --> 52:21.737
Please. Don't embarrass me.

52:21.739 --> 52:24.373
No, I'm not gonna embarrass you.
I'm sticking up for you.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.342
This isn't a prison yard.
You can't do that here.

52:26.344 --> 52:28.878
You're right.
It is much more cutthroat here.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.813
- Right.
- I'm really freaking out.

52:33.351 --> 52:35.851
That's the critic
from ArtQuake.com.

52:35.853 --> 52:37.920
I have to go now
before this becomes a bloodbath.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.188
Good luck, honeybun.

52:39.857 --> 52:41.190
I love you.

52:41.626 --> 52:42.691
Okay.

52:45.563 --> 52:48.797
Someone please take her
brush and lock her up in a cell.

52:50.668 --> 52:51.834
Red. Red.

52:51.836 --> 52:53.569
Unbelievable.

52:53.571 --> 52:59.375
- That's my wife you're talking about.
- You have my deepest sympathies.

52:59.377 --> 53:01.610
That's funny.
I'll kill you, mate!

53:01.612 --> 53:03.479
Excuse my friend.
He's had a few too many.

53:03.481 --> 53:04.947
You're a crumb!

53:04.949 --> 53:07.183
- What the fuck is a crumb?
- Come on, man.

53:07.185 --> 53:09.318
"A few too many"?
Whose side are you on, Leroy?

53:09.320 --> 53:11.554
It's Le Roi.
And you can't be getting into fights, bruh.

53:11.556 --> 53:13.856
I won't be
purchasing any art here.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.424
Don't think these lackadaisical
motherfuckers won't call the cops

53:15.426 --> 53:16.692
and throw your ass back
in jail, man.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.360
They'll do that shit.

53:18.362 --> 53:19.762
How's that help Chloé, huh?

53:20.598 --> 53:21.697
God!

53:22.567 --> 53:24.200
You need to
get out of here, man.

53:24.202 --> 53:25.701
Like, just go.
I'll explain it to her.

53:25.703 --> 53:26.936
I couldn't stand there
while someone was

53:26.938 --> 53:28.571
talking shit about my wife.

53:28.573 --> 53:30.206
This ain't even
about you, brother.

53:30.208 --> 53:32.208
It's about Chloé.
It's her night.

53:32.210 --> 53:35.211
Just calm the fuck down
and step outside for a minute.

53:35.213 --> 53:37.680
Ooh, ah.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.004
Finally.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.341
Uh-uh.

54:17.521 --> 54:19.688
You're welcome,
Your Highness. Hm.

54:22.693 --> 54:24.827
Look at this mess.
Look at that.

54:29.900 --> 54:32.301
Hello.

54:33.004 --> 54:34.303
May I help you?

54:34.639 --> 54:35.738
Yes.

54:37.441 --> 54:43.045
I would like for you to help me.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.350
Perhaps...

54:50.421 --> 54:52.321
I have the wrong apartment.

54:52.323 --> 54:55.724
The owner of the house
isn't home. Mister...

54:56.394 --> 54:58.861
You can call me Luc.

55:00.498 --> 55:02.531
I'll wait for them to return.

55:02.533 --> 55:04.800
Excuse me!
You can't come in here.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.375
Excuse me.
You can't come in here.

55:15.413 --> 55:16.912
- No?
- No!

55:21.018 --> 55:23.786
I believe I just did.

55:23.788 --> 55:26.755
You need to leave now
and come back when they return.

55:26.757 --> 55:31.660
But I'm a friend of the family,
in from France

55:31.662 --> 55:34.029
on vacation.

55:34.031 --> 55:36.432
I'm afraid I must insist.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.338
If you must.

56:06.597 --> 56:10.833
Are you a Mexican?

56:10.835 --> 56:12.568
What difference does that make?

56:14.505 --> 56:15.804
None at all.

56:16.073 --> 56:17.706
I was just wondering

56:17.708 --> 56:21.844
where my dear old
family friends are.

56:21.846 --> 56:28.150
And why they have a Mexican woman in
their home while they're not here.

56:28.152 --> 56:30.018
None of your business.

56:31.422 --> 56:34.723
Now, if you don't leave,
I'm going to call the police.

56:35.059 --> 56:37.159
Ahh.

56:37.161 --> 56:43.432
Listen to the red-hot jalapeño
making spicy threats.

56:43.434 --> 56:44.733
Get out!

56:55.946 --> 56:57.846
And what if I don't?

56:58.783 --> 57:02.818
What if I call Immigration
instead?

57:06.157 --> 57:09.525
Yes. This is more like it.

57:13.097 --> 57:17.900
Give it to me,
my red-hot spicy habanero.

57:20.938 --> 57:22.137
Ohh.

57:23.707 --> 57:25.941
You speak <i> français.</i>

57:28.913 --> 57:33.182
The language of love.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.491
You have a little girl.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.493
No.

57:51.135 --> 57:54.203
Red's little girl.

58:06.851 --> 58:08.150
<i>En garde.</i>

58:12.523 --> 58:14.123
Oh. Ow.

58:39.984 --> 58:41.917
Lola. Lola.

58:55.266 --> 58:56.565
Run.

59:35.339 --> 59:36.705
GLOCKs.

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:12.307
Oh, why couldn't she have been
a pop star?

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:13.609
Right.

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:17.679
It's been ten minutes.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:19.915
- Fuck.
- What the fuck is he doing here?

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:22.651
Shit on a shingle.
Is that Sanchez?

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:25.654
Shit.

01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:29.091
Honeybun,
why did you invite my parole officer?

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.826
Because he's
a serious art collector.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:33.295
Did you know that he owns
an original Damien Hirst?

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:37.332
Ah, that defies logic.
And it's beside the point.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.168
The point is,
nothing good can come from him being here.

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:43.305
Well, he is here.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.741
So there's nothing
I can do about it now.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:49.144
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Fuck, that was selfish of me.

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:52.381
This is your night,
and I'm here for you 100%.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:56.051
You all right, honeybun?

01:00:57.788 --> 01:01:00.122
This is all such bullshit.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.791
I don't care about any of this.
I don't care about these people.

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:05.360
I just... I did it for you.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.429
And now we're going to be
in debt to Mr. Blarney.

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:10.232
In debt to Derrek?
We are gonna owe fucking Derrek money?

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:14.770
We are broke.
I've spent all the money from the advance.

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:18.006
And none of these paintings
are going to sell. And...

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.809
And what? And what? And what?
Tell me, honey.

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:24.112
No. You don't want to know,
trust me.

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:25.881
Yeah, I probably want to know.

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:28.216
- It doesn't matter.
- What? What happened?

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:29.785
Tell me. What?

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:32.988
Did Derrek try and touch you?

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.061
I'm going
to fucking kill that...

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:40.796
Hey, you're on probation.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.898
- And the man is within earshot.
- Yeah, good.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.299
Sanchez will hear
it when I crush Derrek's skull

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:45.967
with some
fucking installation art!

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:48.937
Jesus, Red.
Have you learned nothing?

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:51.173
If you abandon us
and go back to prison,

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:53.175
I will divorce you.
You understand me?

01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:54.443
- Yeah, absolutely.
<i>- Finito.</i>

01:01:54.445 --> 01:01:55.911
I understand. I just...

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:57.446
He's such a fucking creep.

01:01:57.448 --> 01:01:59.781
And I was just trying
to defend your honor.

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:01.783
Well, don't.

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:04.453
Just get me out of here before
this becomes a zombie apocalypse.

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:06.935
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, it's a little too late for that.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:09.124
Thank you for sugarcoating it.

01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.392
Honey, I don't give a rat's ass

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.227
if any of these paintings sell.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.862
To tell you the truth,
I don't want any of them to sell.

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:15.330
I want them all
hanging in our home.

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:16.732
Ohh.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.068
I love you but you'll still
have to pay for them.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.437
Well then I can pay for them in kisses.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:25.474
Kisses will not
help pay the rent.

01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:27.876
Honeybun, I told you, all right?

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.011
Papa will provide.

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.152
I'm going to get my coat.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.253
Okay.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.157
- Sorry you had to see that, man.
- Yeah, man.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:17.392
Going somewhere?

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.462
Home. I'm going home.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:22.864
Your show is a failure.

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:24.566
I shall have my bank
collect what you owe me.

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:27.369
And you and your miserable family
will be out on the street.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:31.106
Thank you so much
for all of your support.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:34.943
I hate what you're going to
make me do.

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:39.080
I can be
an incredibly generous man,

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:43.118
a warm and compassionate lover
and partner.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.553
My husband is here.

01:03:44.555 --> 01:03:50.358
But I can also have the capacity
to sever myself from my emotions.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.394
A Blarney family trait,
if you will.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:05.373
Did you hear that?

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:07.175
Hear what?

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:28.630
Ohh!

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:40.876
If you leave me,
my heart will die.

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:47.949
And there will be nothing left
except cold, dark revenge.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.986
That's all there ever was.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:55.190
Goodbye, Mr. Blarney.

01:04:56.627 --> 01:04:58.593
What kind of man would I be
if I didn't fight for you?

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:00.295
Get out of my way.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.570
No. Hm?

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:13.074
- Lolita? Hello?
<i>- Chloé!</i>

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.210
- Chloé!
- What the...

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.444
- Derrek!
- I love you, dammit!

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:18.079
Don't you understand?
I love you!

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:21.116
I don't love you.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:22.417
Chloé!

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:28.556
Get back here right now!
I'll ruin you!

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:30.492
Mama!

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:32.060
- Beatrice!
- Bumble Bea?

01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:39.267
Luc Chaltiel?
Oh, shit. Honey, run!

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.536
Red!

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:46.574
Everybody, down!
Hit the fucking ground!

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.244
Drop it!

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.683
Oh, fuck, Jesus.
Don't fucking die, Leroy.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:58.153
- It's Le Roi.
- I told you, mate, that sounds fucking stupid.

01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.988
How bad is it, man?

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.557
It's fucking bad, brother.

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.715
I'm coming to get you,
motherfucker.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.322
Oh, no.

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:37.359
Bubble butts.

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:39.494
- What was that?
- Spread it around.

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:42.030
To bubble butts?

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.698
We gotta reciprocate, brother.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.600
I will. I will.
I promise. I promise.

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:50.071
I love you, bro.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.340
Just go.

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.343
Red!

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:15.497
Oh, shit. Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God. Oh, my God.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.665
- Beatrice, what are you doing here?
- You need to get out of here!

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.502
- This is your fault!
- You brought him here!

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.239
Tell me if there's
another way out of here.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:27.509
It's the only way out.
It's locked for security reasons.

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:32.147
- Out of the way, hon.
- Get down!

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:34.315
Not on my watch, motherfucker.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:41.656
- Where is the car?
- It's at the corner!

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.628
Okay, Bumble Bea. Now strap in.
And keep your head really, really low.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.762
<i>Oui,</i> Papa.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:50.632
- Keys!
- Maybe I should drive?

01:07:50.634 --> 01:07:52.200
I'm a better driver than you.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:53.201
And you are
a better shot than me.

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:54.302
Yeah, you're right.

01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:57.572
Of course I'm right.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.140
Wait, hold on a minute.
What do you mean "shot"?

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:01.509
There's a Lady Derringer
in the glove box.

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:05.180
- Lady who?
- Le Roi gave it to me for self-protection.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.382
Um...

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:08.716
Honeybun, the bad guy is coming.

01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:15.790
Let's get the fuck
out of here, eh?

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:17.591
- Shoot the gun!
- Yeah, right.

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:24.131
Do I have to
do everything around here?

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:47.622
Where is he?

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.328
Where the fuck did he go?

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:56.663
You blew out
my fucking eardrums.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.399
Shit. I'm sorry, honeybun.

01:08:58.401 --> 01:09:01.202
I can't hear your apology
because I'm deaf now!

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:05.406
Who is that man?
And why is he trying to kill us?

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:10.345
What? What is that look?

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.412
What look?

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:16.417
That guilty look.
What is it you're not telling me?

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:18.853
His name is Luc Chaltiel, okay?
And he is pretty much

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:21.189
at the top of the mob's
psychopath totem pole.

01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:22.756
His brother is the one who died

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:24.359
during the investment bank job
I did time for.

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:26.928
So what?
He is looking for revenge?

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.595
Among other things, yeah.

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:29.731
Oh, great.

01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:34.702
Other things?
What other things?

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.171
Probably the bearer bonds.

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:38.439
What bearer bonds?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.742
From the investment bank job.

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:43.711
I thought they were destroyed.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:49.384
I... You told me that you got
off light with only two years

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:50.952
because they were destroyed.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.854
Yeah, well, not all of them,
okay? And I lied.

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:57.659
And fucking why not?

01:09:57.661 --> 01:10:00.895
- This money is our ticket out.
- Mm, great.

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:02.564
That's just great, Red.

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:05.400
You made me a promise!
Do you know what that is?

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:08.836
- Yes, honey.
- A promise! Do you?

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:12.707
It's a guarantee or an assurance
that one will do a particular thing

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.909
or that guarantees
a particular thing will happen.

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.778
Just because
you've been sitting in jail

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.647
with enough time on your hands
to read the dictionary

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:22.383
doesn't mean you know
what the definition means.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.586
You're right, honeybun.
I'm sorry.

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:26.654
- How much?
- What?

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:28.423
How much is it worth?

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:30.825
It's our entire future.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.860
How much?

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.996
- Our cut is 500,000.
- Dollars?

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:37.799
Yeah, I mean, tax free.
It's all ours.

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:40.235
You said it was just a stash.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.836
This is the stash.

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:43.938
This is not a stash.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.974
- This is hot money.
- Look, it's our ticket out of here.

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:47.976
And it's the only ticket
we've got. It's the reason

01:10:47.978 --> 01:10:50.445
I spent the last two years
away from you and Bumble Bea.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:52.380
And I'm gonna make damn sure that
wasn't a fucking waste of time!

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:54.616
- Why are you yelling at me?
- Because I love you.

01:10:58.388 --> 01:10:59.520
Where is it?

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:02.523
It's at the shop.

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:04.892
We need to get it.

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:08.563
I agree.

01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:13.735
Sit tight, honeybun.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:16.437
You've got to be shitting me.
What is "a few minutes"?

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.740
A few minutes. I don't know.
Long enough to open the safe

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.608
and get the bonds in a gym bag,
and I'll be back.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.277
A gym bag?

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:24.279
Or a suitcase, whatever.
It doesn't matter.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:27.515
Look, Leroy gave me the master key,
so I won't be long.

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:30.385
Go. And be quick about it,
please.

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:32.620
Don't zone out
like you always do.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.756
You're beautiful
when you're serious.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:37.158
- Red, you're still standing there.
- Shit. Right.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:38.893
Keys.

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:40.762
Thanks, honeybun.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:57.745
Okay.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:59.781
<i>♪ Money, money, money, money ♪</i>

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:06.454
You really
were the king, brother.

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:08.990
Okay.

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:48.463
We will sail today.

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:53.801
- Bumble Bea?
- Papa!

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.703
Bumble Bea, what are you doing?

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.081
Honeybun!

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.610
Take Beatrice and go.

01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:07.915
If you run, I will shoot you.

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:12.720
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:13.821
<i>Maman!</i>

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:18.426
It's gonna be all right,
honeybun.

01:13:18.428 --> 01:13:19.794
Get your hands off of me.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.400
It's okay.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:29.637
This is a nice place you have,
Red.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.408
Long time no see, mate.

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:40.415
It has been a long time.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:41.516
Yeah.

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:43.484
So...

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:46.120
what the fuck, Luc?

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.756
Red, Beatrice.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:50.124
Sorry. Sorry.

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:51.859
You killed my brother.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:57.932
Now, it is my pleasure
to kill you

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.067
and your entire family.

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:02.603
Now, hold on a second.
Now, hold on, mate.

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:04.505
Is that what this is about?

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.675
Mate, you've got it all wrong.

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:09.644
Mate, the job went south.

01:14:09.646 --> 01:14:11.579
The cops showed up.

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:12.947
I mean, everything went to shit.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.549
And your brother started
acting a little...

01:14:14.551 --> 01:14:15.783
You know?

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.151
You know what he was like.

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:20.555
I didn't kill him.
The cops did.

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:23.691
- You lived.
- What, so I've gotta die just because he dies?

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:25.927
That's not fair.
We know the risks.

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.829
And the cards fell
where the cards fell.

01:14:27.831 --> 01:14:29.764
Your brother,
he went down in a blaze of glory.

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:31.566
You'd be proud.
It was just like he lived.

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:34.101
And no disrespect, but...

01:14:36.072 --> 01:14:37.472
I had other plans.

01:14:37.474 --> 01:14:39.474
I got a family, a wife...

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.743
a daughter.

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:45.813
I just got out of the joint, mate.
Literally this morning.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:49.016
- I know.
- You know?

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:52.987
I have waited two years for you
to be released from prison,

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:57.225
where I could have
had you killed.

01:14:57.227 --> 01:15:00.561
But this would have been
inelegant.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:01.696
"Inelegant."

01:15:01.698 --> 01:15:03.865
I wanted to see you myself.

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:09.954
And now...

01:15:09.955 --> 01:15:12.672
that it is here
in front of my eyes...

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:17.612
it is more delightful
than I ever could imagine.

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:20.114
No, no!

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:21.616
Hold on, hold on a second.

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:22.717
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:15:23.253 --> 01:15:24.519
Just one...

01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:27.622
One second.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.996
Six hundred grand in untraceable
US bearer bonds in this bag.

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:36.264
You can have it all.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:41.836
And me.

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:46.908
Just leave my family alone,
and it's all yours.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:50.144
- No, Red, please.
- No, honey, just a second.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:51.712
I'm negotiating
with this gentleman.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.714
Please. No.

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:57.952
This would not be revenge if I
did not take everything from you.

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:00.821
It would not be...

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.257
poetic.

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:06.160
Besides...

01:16:08.298 --> 01:16:13.234
it is mine
even if I kill all of you.

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:17.572
Well, I mean, if you're gonna think
about it and logic it out and stuff,

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:19.734
- I guess you're right.
- Red, goddammit, do something!

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:21.810
Oh!

01:16:21.945 --> 01:16:23.044
No!

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:28.783
Run!

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:40.661
Your daughter will die
in this safe... slowly.

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:43.898
Do not breathe very much.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:47.335
You have air
for five minutes only.

01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:55.943
Not that anyone
will be able to get her out.

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:59.046
Fuck you.

01:17:03.886 --> 01:17:05.920
I give you a little kiss.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.058
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:16.243
Red!

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:18.312
Red, help!

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:23.551
Red!

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.163
Bumble Bea.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:51.272
Fuck.

01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:55.109
Fuck. Fuck.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:56.510
Bumble Bea, Bumble Bea,
listen to Papa, okay?

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:58.045
Red, help!

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:09.024
Okay.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:36.183
I promise, okay?

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:54.101
Sodomy.

01:23:04.981 --> 01:23:06.080
Run, honeybun!

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:23.564
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:41.348
Freeze, motherfucker,
or I will make you dead.

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:48.589
No!

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:58.265
Nice shooting, Sanchez.

01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:22.222
Lucky day.

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:53.287
Honeybun!

01:24:53.289 --> 01:24:56.090
Oh, thank goodness. Oh, God.
Are you all right?

01:24:56.092 --> 01:24:57.791
You okay? Are you okay?
Okay.

01:24:57.793 --> 01:24:59.093
Bumble Bea.

01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:02.729
- Bumble Bea! It's Papa!
- Beatrice!

01:25:02.731 --> 01:25:03.831
Can you hear me?
Are you all right?

01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:05.532
- Beatrice!
- Freeze!

01:25:05.534 --> 01:25:07.301
- Hands above your head.
- Sanchez, please!

01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:09.236
I said,
"Hands above your head."

01:25:09.238 --> 01:25:11.672
- You too!
- I am not going to put my hands up.

01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:15.843
Lady, I may just be
a parole officer,

01:25:15.845 --> 01:25:18.712
but I'm also
a motherfucking cop.

01:25:18.714 --> 01:25:20.447
Okay?

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:23.550
I will blow you away
with complete impunity.

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:27.254
So I'm gonna advise you,
put your motherfucking hands above your head,

01:25:27.256 --> 01:25:30.657
or I'm gonna shoot you both dead
and call it a motherfucking day.

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:33.494
- My daughter is in there!
- Then just shoot me then, mate.

01:25:33.496 --> 01:25:36.163
Okay? Our daughter's in that safe,
she's running out of air.

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:38.165
If I don't crack it right now,
she's dead.

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:46.273
For fuck's sake, Sanchez!
I know I'm in deep shit. I know that.

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:49.276
Just let me crack this safe and you can
throw me away for as long as you want.

01:25:49.278 --> 01:25:51.845
Please don't let her die.

01:25:58.554 --> 01:26:00.654
No funny stuff.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:07.194
You've opened
this safe before, right?

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.530
Is this an easy safe
to crack, honey?

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:11.465
I've only done it once.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.168
But you've done it.

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:16.770
- Kind of.
- "Kind of"? What the fuck's that mean?

01:26:16.772 --> 01:26:18.805
It means if it can be done,
I'm gonna do it.

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:20.407
Now shut the fuck up.

01:26:20.409 --> 01:26:22.309
Then stop talking
and fucking do it.

01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:26.547
Okay.

01:26:43.399 --> 01:26:45.265
I don't hear her.

01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:47.534
- It's fine. It's fine.
- I can't hear her.

01:26:49.338 --> 01:26:52.378
I'm gonna get her out of here.
I'm gonna get her out. I'm gonna get her out.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:57.277
Eight, two, four.
Two, four. Two, four.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.273
Bumble Bea! Bumble Bea!

01:27:26.275 --> 01:27:27.841
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, my sweet.

01:27:27.843 --> 01:27:29.009
Thank you, Papa.

01:27:32.014 --> 01:27:33.513
Thank you, Papa.

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:36.350
It's all right, Bumble Bea.

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:40.854
Okay.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:42.522
Thank you, Sanchez.

01:27:49.465 --> 01:27:50.697
Are you okay?

01:27:54.737 --> 01:27:55.836
No, Red.

01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:57.971
The way I see it...

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:04.811
there's no evidence.

01:28:04.813 --> 01:28:06.446
There's no evidence.
There ain't no court

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:08.582
that's gonna
make any of this stick.

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:11.551
You're not gonna bust me?

01:28:11.553 --> 01:28:13.920
Really, it ain't a violation

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:19.826
if you've got some crazy madman
randomly attacking you.

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:26.066
Shit. They'll probably even give me a
medal for stopping this rampage, you know?

01:28:26.068 --> 01:28:29.903
Put me back on
the fucking streets again.

01:28:31.674 --> 01:28:33.674
Thank you so much, Sanchez.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.709
Thank you, Officer.

01:28:43.419 --> 01:28:44.951
I got a hard job.

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:47.954
I ain't a cop,

01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:50.724
and I ain't a social worker.

01:28:52.094 --> 01:28:53.694
And I gotta be both.

01:28:56.865 --> 01:28:58.699
There's one thing
I learned about...

01:29:00.936 --> 01:29:02.569
in this job, and that's...

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.606
when people are in love...

01:29:10.079 --> 01:29:11.511
there's a chance.

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:19.019
Well, there's plenty of
parole violations right here.

01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:23.390
You better get out of here before I
come to my senses and take you in.

01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:26.993
Go on. Get out of here.

01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:29.429
We're going home now.
Everything's all right.

01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:30.564
Come on, let's go.

01:30:12.007 --> 01:30:13.774
I love you, Lolita.

01:30:26.622 --> 01:30:28.021
Are you all right, honey?

01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:29.583
They are going
to stop our water.

01:30:30.626 --> 01:30:33.727
Well, bottled water's
better for us.

01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:35.829
At least we're not
being evicted.

01:30:35.831 --> 01:30:39.199
No, but we just got the notice.

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:42.102
I mean, did we see ourselves
living here forever?

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:44.438
Right.
Let's just run away.

01:30:45.707 --> 01:30:47.674
I don't know
what we're going to do, Red.

01:30:48.877 --> 01:30:51.678
With everything we owe...

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.948
As cheesy as it sounds,
we have our lives, and we're together.

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:57.584
And, well, that's all
that really matters.

01:30:57.586 --> 01:30:58.885
Hm.

01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:04.124
Maybe we move back to Paris.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.826
You would do that?

01:31:05.828 --> 01:31:07.461
I'd do anything for you.

01:31:13.769 --> 01:31:15.969
So is this the end
of the story now, Mommy?

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:18.505
No, I don't think so, sweetie.

01:31:24.213 --> 01:31:26.680
Shh, shh. Hey.

01:31:33.856 --> 01:31:36.523
- Chloé. Red.
- Mr. Blarney?

01:31:36.525 --> 01:31:39.526
It's completely unprecedented,
a phenomenon.

01:31:39.795 --> 01:31:40.961
What is?

01:31:40.963 --> 01:31:42.496
We sold the entire show.

01:31:42.898 --> 01:31:43.997
It was a sensation.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.665
The Chinese bought three.

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:47.834
There was a bidding war
over the largest piece.

01:31:48.203 --> 01:31:49.603
It fetched 300,000.

01:31:49.938 --> 01:31:50.971
But how?

01:31:50.973 --> 01:31:52.639
With cash.

01:31:52.641 --> 01:31:54.074
Once people saw
the paintings finished,

01:31:54.076 --> 01:31:56.510
well, the offers
started pouring in.

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.178
Some over the Internet,
sight unseen. I mean,

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:00.714
the word really spread out.
I mean, it went viral.

01:32:00.716 --> 01:32:02.048
So hold on a second.

01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:03.650
What do you mean, "finished"?

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:05.685
Well, the blood.

01:32:06.822 --> 01:32:09.089
The blood of your critics.

01:32:09.091 --> 01:32:10.957
They say
you're the next Jeff Koons.

01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:13.059
There's tremendous excitement
over your next show.

01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:14.961
I, of course, would...

01:32:14.963 --> 01:32:16.963
I would front
a sizable advance.

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:19.699
After all, we do work together
quite well, don't you think?

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.735
- It's upside down.
- Mm.

01:32:23.272 --> 01:32:24.571
Thank you, child.

01:32:25.207 --> 01:32:26.306
There you are.

01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:33.146
Now, that is, of course, an advance
on current sales and future earnings.

01:32:34.082 --> 01:32:35.215
Good faith, and all.

01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:36.783
- Future earnings?
- Mm.

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:41.187
I don't know.

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:44.658
You simply can't
leave me behind, Chloé.

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:48.128
Now, remember,
I took you to where you are now.

01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:50.230
- I made you. So you...
- We'll call you, mate.

01:32:53.569 --> 01:32:55.302
They're not going
to turn off our water.

01:32:58.206 --> 01:32:59.973
The end.

01:33:03.111 --> 01:33:04.978
- Ow!
- Ooh!

01:36:06.228 --> 01:36:07.827
Two, three, four.

01:36:07.829 --> 01:36:09.963
One, two, three, four.

01:36:09.965 --> 01:36:12.365
One, two, three, four...

01:36:19.975 --> 01:36:21.908
