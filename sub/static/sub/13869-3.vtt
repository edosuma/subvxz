WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.711
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:02.735 --> 00:04.238
but no one noticed...

00:04.272 --> 00:05.306
(growling)

00:05.339 --> 00:06.483
until they began attacking,

00:06.507 --> 00:08.242
coordinating,

00:08.276 --> 00:09.277
evolving.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.145
The animals were mutating,

00:11.179 --> 00:12.789
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:12.813 --> 00:13.681
(mice squeaking)

00:13.714 --> 00:16.283
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.394
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.418 --> 00:18.486
in six to ten years

00:18.519 --> 00:20.121
the world's animal population

00:20.154 --> 00:22.423
will be thriving once again.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.358
Killing the animals?
Play God and repopulate

00:24.392 --> 00:25.493
the planet?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.727
This is ridiculous.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.462
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.496 --> 00:30.264
could be catastrophic,

00:30.298 --> 00:32.109
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.535
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.568 --> 00:36.137
animal experts.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.405
Chloe Tousignant,

00:37.438 --> 00:38.672
an intel operative.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.441
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.474 --> 00:42.176
a reporter who's been

00:42.210 --> 00:44.312
following this story, found me,

00:44.345 --> 00:45.546
Mitch Morgan,

00:45.579 --> 00:47.515
a veterinary pathologist.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.618
Together we're
going to find a cure

00:50.651 --> 00:51.719
for the animals.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.155
Time is running out.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.590
Previously on Zoo...

00:56.624 --> 00:58.226
Jamie!

00:58.259 --> 00:59.227
We have to go!

00:59.260 --> 01:00.394
Get your hands off me!

01:00.428 --> 01:01.571
I'm taking you! (Mitch grunts)

01:01.595 --> 01:04.265
SOLDIER: Go, go!
I hate you for this.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.105
(soft groaning)

01:11.139 --> 01:12.673
Lucky for me that
you came along.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.375
This is where we're going.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.543
In Caraquet.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.254
(dog growls,
Jackson grunts) MITCH: You all right?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.488
JACKSON: It's a dog
bite, it's fine.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.180
Doesn't look too good.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.349
I changed your medical records.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.117
We'll keep this
between the two of us.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.285
Our little secret that what?

01:24.318 --> 01:26.220
My blood's changing?
That I'm changing?

01:26.254 --> 01:28.422
Changing into what?

01:28.456 --> 01:29.523
(strained panting)

01:29.557 --> 01:30.591
I've heard this before.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.192
Searching for an animal

01:31.225 --> 01:32.760
with a phase two mutation.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.362
So I got a hit on
his fingerprints.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.363
Janos Kovacs.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.798
There is something specific

01:37.831 --> 01:39.733
about Kovacs'
genetic makeup that

01:39.767 --> 01:41.245
made it possible for the
mutation to occur in him.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.437
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.312
As the death toll in the
human-animal conflict

01:51.345 --> 01:53.747
nears one million and rumors
swirl that the mutation

01:53.781 --> 01:55.749
has taken on a new phase,

01:55.783 --> 01:57.718
spiritual leaders are
calling for an interfaith

01:57.751 --> 01:59.787
day of prayer on behalf of those

01:59.820 --> 02:01.789
searching tirelessly for a cure.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.123
(gunshots, thud)

02:04.925 --> 02:06.460
He's dead.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.429
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.864
What were you thinking, huh?
Who are you, anyway?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.643
You never should've brought that
monster on this plane. Huh, who is she?

02:13.667 --> 02:14.744
That monster was our only chance

02:14.768 --> 02:16.337
at understanding
the new mutation!

02:16.370 --> 02:17.738
He already killed
six of my guys,

02:17.771 --> 02:19.583
you wanted to wait until
he killed somebody else?

02:19.607 --> 02:21.442
Everybody should just calm down.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.843
Calm down?
Yeah, great idea, Abe.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.779
I can namaste with the best of
them, but you know what?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.791
This chick just ruined our
best shot at saving the world.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.626
You're going to save the world?
Yeah, that's the idea.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.628
Oh, well that's just great,
that just really inspires confidence.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.886
Okay, enough now!

02:32.920 --> 02:35.756
Mitch, run every test
you can on the body.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.292
Well, that's going to require a
whole lot of complex DNA work,

02:38.326 --> 02:40.594
and I'm not going to be
able to do that unless

02:40.628 --> 02:42.863
we bring D.C. in on it.
We'll figure out a way...

02:42.896 --> 02:44.208
Hold on,
you haven't told Washington?

02:44.232 --> 02:45.899
No, I haven't told Washington.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.668
My team died for
that festering freak

02:47.701 --> 02:49.270
and you bastards are off book?

02:49.303 --> 02:51.205
This operation is
strictly need-to-know.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.941
I don't give a steaming crap
about your spy secrets, lady.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.976
I want my ops center
on the radio now.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.545
I don't care what you want.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.547
This plane is under my command.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.914
And so are you.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.961
(groans)

03:13.994 --> 03:14.995
You sure you're okay?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.797
Yeah, I will be.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.566
When we get to Caraquet.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.701
Hook up with my friends.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.537
If we keep following the river

03:23.571 --> 03:25.014
we should be there by
nightfall tomorrow.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.774
LOGAN: Yeah,
if we actually make it.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.743
We're low on food and matches.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.745
(distant snarl)

03:33.314 --> 03:35.483
(screech)

03:35.516 --> 03:38.319
We could use a gun, too.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.393
LOGAN: I've flown over
this place a dozen times.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.960
From up there it looks great,

03:46.994 --> 03:49.663
down here it kind of sucks.
You're a pilot?

03:49.697 --> 03:51.932
LOGAN: Used to fly rich
guys up here to drink beer

03:51.965 --> 03:53.934
and shoot cute
little furry things.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.003
Then the furry
things got less cute.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.571
So how'd you get stranded?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.940
I do mail runs for some
of the smaller towns.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.509
Plane got forced down.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.344
I had no choice but
to try and hoof it.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.313
I didn't know it
would be this cold.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.357
You don't have anything in
there that you can put on?

04:07.381 --> 04:09.317
Not unless I want to
stuff my pants with

04:09.350 --> 04:10.718
Andrew Jackson's face.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.421
So you're lugging around money?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.855
Yeah, it's my life's savings.

04:14.888 --> 04:15.923
Every penny of it.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.658
Kelly, my girlfriend,

04:17.690 --> 04:20.827
she didn't trust banks
in the best of times,

04:20.861 --> 04:23.764
let alone during the
animal apocalypse.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.701
So, uh,
why carry it around with you?

04:27.735 --> 04:28.936
Why don't you just

04:28.969 --> 04:30.904
leave it at home?
We had some wolves

04:30.938 --> 04:32.906
get into our
apartment in Halifax.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.908
It was bad. I got out.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.009
But Kelly didn't.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.381
Everybody has a story like
that these days, right?

04:40.414 --> 04:42.316
What's yours?

04:45.819 --> 04:46.987
Just, uh...

04:49.122 --> 04:51.859
doing time at the
end of the world.

04:51.892 --> 04:52.926
Like everybody else.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.537
(loud grunting)

05:12.480 --> 05:13.681
Tires.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.982
Clever.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.025
When I was back home,
I would tie a mattress

05:16.049 --> 05:18.018
to a tree whenever I needed
to sort something out.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.687
Anyway, I just came to tell you,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.589
we're dropping you at
your base in Sao Paulo

05:21.622 --> 05:22.890
in a few hours' time. Mm.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.925
I thought you
might want to know.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.761
Am I supposed to say thank you?
No.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.531
I could break that French
girl into a hundred pieces.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.799
You know that, right?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.100
Can make it so she wouldn't be

05:33.133 --> 05:34.802
pretty again for a month.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.604
Chloe is just doing her job.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.772
It's amazing, isn't it?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.974
When people on her side of
things "just do their job,"

05:41.008 --> 05:44.077
people on my side of things
die in great big chunks.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.547
You lost people you care about.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.781
So have we.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.016
It's not easy.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.784
But we're trying to stop

05:50.818 --> 05:52.386
this thing.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.721
Set the world right.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.689
Even if you do,

05:55.723 --> 05:58.025
those people are still gone.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.862
That is why we
can never give up.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.932
So there are others still
left to remember them.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.940
Anyway,
I'll just leave you to it.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.475
Unless there's
anything else I can do.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.646
(panting)

06:18.679 --> 06:19.947
Maybe one thing.

06:25.853 --> 06:26.920
Okay. (moans)

06:35.696 --> 06:36.964
(indistinct chatter)

06:52.480 --> 06:53.714
(ants chittering)

06:57.718 --> 06:59.653
JACKSON: We have to tell
Mitch, Chloe.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.923
If there is even a chance
that I have the same mutation,

07:02.956 --> 07:04.501
Mitch needs to know that there's
another phase two subject

07:04.525 --> 07:05.493
he can study. Jackson...

07:05.526 --> 07:07.495
No. You know it's true.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.538
If they learn about
it in Washington,

07:08.562 --> 07:10.764
they will lock you in a cage.
Mitch is our friend.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.241
He's not going to tell
anyone, we can trust him.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.201
What if someone
accesses his data?

07:14.234 --> 07:16.036
The only way to guarantee
this stays secret

07:16.069 --> 07:17.505
is to not tell anyone.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.107
Ooh, what are we
not telling anyone?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.078
Eleanor wants to talk to us.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.848
Okay.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.717
ELEANOR: I need
you to meet me in

07:29.750 --> 07:31.719
Geneva, Switzerland immediately.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.087
They're pushing forward
on the Noah Objective.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.857
A multinational conference
has been assembled here

07:36.890 --> 07:38.258
to work out logistics.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.793
I thought we had more time.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.963
General Andrew Davies
has taken over,

07:42.996 --> 07:45.933
and his methods are aggressive.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.734
What does that mean?

07:46.767 --> 07:48.869
I'd rather discuss
this in person.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.538
Okay, we-we'll come
as soon as we can.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.805
What about Jamie?

07:51.839 --> 07:53.741
Resources are
scarce, Dr. Morgan,

07:53.774 --> 07:55.576
but Jamie is still at
the top of my list.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.920
As soon as there's
a team available.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.979
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.948
Okay, so we'll come
straight to your hotel

08:00.981 --> 08:02.082
once we land.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.552
No. I'll come to the plane.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.687
Have your pilot notify my
adjutant, Lieutenant Reed,

08:06.720 --> 08:07.955
when you land.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.990
Of course. And understand this,

08:10.023 --> 08:11.291
we need to tread lightly.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.060
General Davies

08:13.093 --> 08:14.995
and his supporters
want all alternatives

08:15.028 --> 08:16.997
to the Noah Objective shut down.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.031
At any cost.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.933
Well, he's gonna love us.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.134
Just be careful.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.036
We'll see you then. Stay safe.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.149
Did she seem a
little off to you?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.140
Yes. CHLOE: Yes.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.776
Something is wrong.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.022
(coughing)

08:48.929 --> 08:50.698
(gasping, choking)

08:54.902 --> 08:56.269
(electricity crackles)

09:01.074 --> 09:03.143
♪

09:41.181 --> 09:42.191
JAMIE: No, no!
LOGAN: What, what?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.651
What happened?

09:43.684 --> 09:44.652
JAMIE: No,
we followed the river,

09:44.685 --> 09:47.120
it should have taken us
all the way to Caraquet.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.632
You sure you're not just
reading the map wrong?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.223
No, look.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.993
That mountain's not
supposed to be there.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.996
Oh, my God.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.767
The river.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.935
It moved.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.371
(indistinct conversations)

10:05.973 --> 10:08.108
(indistinct
announcement over P.A.)

10:10.443 --> 10:12.345
Just follow my lead.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.084
JACKSON: I'm assuming Eleanor
didn't want us coming here

10:17.117 --> 10:18.318
for a reason.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.887
Well, she never showed
up at the plane,

10:19.920 --> 10:21.330
so we don't have a
whole lot of options.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.422
That's Lieutenant Reed.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.124
Eleanor's adjutant.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.995
(man speaking French over P.A.)

10:28.028 --> 10:30.998
REED: Excuse me, gentlemen.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.266
Agent Tousignant,
what are you doing here?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.968
Looking for Eleanor.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.369
I assumed she was
still with you.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.805
She never arrived.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.739
I'll ask around.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.174
Maybe someone else has seen her.
Thank you.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.811
REED: I'll check
the other meeting.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.846
Well, that's not good. (sighs)

10:45.879 --> 10:48.181
Wait here.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.751
It's about to get worse.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.152
That's General Davies,

10:52.185 --> 10:53.821
the man Eleanor warned us about.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.955
Agent Tousignant.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.824
General Davies,
pleasure to meet you.

10:56.857 --> 10:57.891
I hope you're not here

10:57.925 --> 10:59.059
to offer us another

10:59.092 --> 11:00.103
ridiculous idea for a cure.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.795
No, we just had some loose ends

11:01.829 --> 11:03.163
to tie up with Eleanor.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.833
Ah, yes,
our patron saint of lost causes.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.401
I'm afraid she's yet to grace
us with her presence today.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.414
Agent Tousignant,
I'm gonna be straight

11:11.438 --> 11:13.974
with you...
You're a talented analyst.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.118
Too talented to be
wasting your time

11:15.142 --> 11:16.944
with Frodo and Sam here.

11:16.977 --> 11:20.814
We can use your skills here
with the Noah Objective.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.183
You cannot exterminate
every animal on the planet

11:23.216 --> 11:25.152
and then repopulate it.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.220
The entire ecosystem will crash.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.421
You understand that, right?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.090
The Noah Objective is the most

11:30.123 --> 11:32.425
scientifically sound
option we have.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.027
It's madness.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.395
Extreme? Yes.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.198
Unquestionably,
but so are the circumstances.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.168
Damn it, I knew it!

11:42.202 --> 11:43.871
I knew I recognized you.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.038
Chloe,

11:45.072 --> 11:46.874
Jackson, this is.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.309
Dr... Andrew Davies.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.812
He's got a PhD from Cambridge.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.180
I read your graduate thesis.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.347
I'm familiar with your work

11:54.381 --> 11:55.949
as well, Dr. Morgan.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.919
The study you published
about mast cell tumors.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.421
The one that was ultimately...

12:01.454 --> 12:02.990
discredited.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.793
You had your chance
to find a cure.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.127
You failed.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.200
Every day spent discussing

12:08.228 --> 12:09.797
how to save the animals

12:09.830 --> 12:11.231
means thousands of human lives

12:11.264 --> 12:12.432
will be lost.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.501
So as much as I'd
like to stand here

12:14.534 --> 12:16.203
debating ethics
with you all day,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.438
I have a war to win.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.877
That's the guy running
the Noah Objective?

12:23.911 --> 12:25.955
And now we're smack-dab in
the middle of his crosshairs.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.115
We need to find Eleanor now.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.293
This lake isn't on the
map, either.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.195
What the hell is going on here?

12:42.229 --> 12:44.264
It's not a lake.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.901
It's a coal mine.

12:47.935 --> 12:51.238
The river was diverted,
and it flooded the mine.

12:51.271 --> 12:55.175
W... who would divert
an entire river?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.310
Beavers.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.445
Right.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.147
They build dams.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.149
What if they built
a really big one?

13:02.182 --> 13:03.350
One that diverted the river.

13:08.255 --> 13:12.059
ABRAHAM: Sorry we couldn't drop
you in Sao Paulo as planned.

13:12.092 --> 13:15.028
They should be able to get
you to your base from here.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.197
Thanks.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.301
(car door opens and closes)

13:22.269 --> 13:24.004
Dariela?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.239
Circumstances aside,
I'm glad we got

13:26.273 --> 13:27.407
to get to know each other.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.843
Even if it was brief.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.511
It was a very

13:31.544 --> 13:33.546
good brief.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.384
After all this is over,
perhaps we could con...

13:38.919 --> 13:41.588
(chuckles)

13:43.123 --> 13:44.424
It's impossible.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.059
Rivers don't just move.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.360
Yeah, well, this one did.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.862
And it put us eight
miles off course.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.363
(shrieking nearby)

13:50.397 --> 13:51.899
Don't move. (low growling)

13:53.233 --> 13:56.136
(shrieks, hissing)

14:05.345 --> 14:07.180
Well, it's gone.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.250
At least for now.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.519
If you say so.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.655
We should keep moving, though.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.158
We don't want to be
here when it comes back.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.033
I'll say one thing about
the animal apocalypse.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.402
Makes it easier to
bribe hotel employees.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.470
Eleanor?

14:30.503 --> 14:33.440
(whispering): No!

14:33.473 --> 14:35.342
(indistinct chatter on TV)

14:40.580 --> 14:42.349
(gasps) Oh!

14:42.382 --> 14:45.218
What happened to her?

14:45.252 --> 14:49.189
Her entire mandible is
separated from her jaw.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.158
All right, we got to call the cops.
Wait.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.525
She wanted to tell us something.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.995
Something she couldn't
say over the phone.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.297
She was concerned someone
was listening to her.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.566
(woman speaking French on TV)

14:59.599 --> 15:02.135
Maybe whoever it was killed her.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.436
Maybe.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.341
Maybe not.
See, those are some scorch marks.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.011
Looks like something burned
her from the inside out.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.413
Radioactive material has been
used in assassinations before.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.714
You think she was assassinated?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.449
She said it herself.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.094
That Davies would shut down
anyone standing in the way

15:18.118 --> 15:19.652
of the Noah Objective.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.288
Yeah, but come on, that's...

15:21.321 --> 15:22.655
that's a little extreme, huh?

15:22.689 --> 15:25.158
MITCH: If I'm gonna
get any answers,

15:25.192 --> 15:27.294
I'm gonna need a sample
of cerebrospinal fluid.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.296
Check out her nervous system

15:29.329 --> 15:30.964
for any chemicals

15:30.998 --> 15:32.499
or radiation.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.001
I'll take a look
around the room.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.302
CHLOE: We need to find out

15:35.335 --> 15:36.575
what she was trying to tell us.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.618
Sorry about this.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.628
(gasps)

16:04.231 --> 16:05.698
(groans)

16:07.134 --> 16:09.136
Mitch... check this out.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.471
(gags) A little busy here.

16:12.772 --> 16:13.973
We got company.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.282
Scoop up some ants. Hurry

16:22.315 --> 16:23.559
before this spinal
fluid goes bad.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.085
Now,
that's a sentence you could go

16:25.118 --> 16:26.486
your whole life and never hear.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.762
Okay, let's get our bearings.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.432
(panting)

16:39.466 --> 16:41.434
If we're going the right way,

16:41.468 --> 16:45.372
there should be two
peaks to the west.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.007
But we need a higher
vantage point to see them.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.286
Ow! Oh!

17:03.190 --> 17:04.257
Are you okay?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.193
Yeah. Just take a minute.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.260
I'll check it out.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.340
Put the bag down.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.111
(grunting)

17:56.209 --> 17:59.312
♪

18:18.665 --> 18:19.632
(animal growling)

18:19.666 --> 18:21.668
(shrieks)

18:21.701 --> 18:23.470
Easy, buddy.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.837
(shrieking)

18:30.677 --> 18:32.612
Jamie.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.614
Are you okay? Yeah.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.384
I, uh...

18:37.417 --> 18:39.619
I was gonna come
meet you halfway,

18:39.652 --> 18:43.156
but a crazed beaver
had other ideas.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.791
"Crazed beaver"?

18:44.824 --> 18:47.360
Yeah.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.664
You see anything up there?

18:51.698 --> 18:52.899
Yeah, I saw the peaks.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.501
We're headed the right way.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.903
Glad your foot's doing better.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.541
(siren wailing)

19:02.575 --> 19:05.144
(indistinct radio transmission)

19:21.361 --> 19:23.330
Eleanor's dead.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.732
Julie, get me on the
next train out of here.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.667
I don't care!

19:27.700 --> 19:28.735
Just do it.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.404
(phone beeps)

19:34.507 --> 19:36.709
MALE REPORTER (on TV): If
you're just joining us,

19:36.743 --> 19:38.687
we're covering breaking news out of
Geneva, Switzerland,

19:38.711 --> 19:42.482
where IADG's consultant,
Eleanor Lewis, was found dead

19:42.515 --> 19:43.483
in her hotel room.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.253
The cause of death has
not yet been released.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.321
Eleanor Lewis is survived
by her 20-year-old son,

19:48.355 --> 19:50.557
a freshman at U-Chicago. Hey.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.359
I'm sorry.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.426
I really am.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.328
We, um, we need to reach out

19:55.362 --> 19:57.330
to someone else in
Eleanor's department.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.507
She didn't have a department.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.899
It was only her and Amelia.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.001
With them both gone,
we're working alone.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.346
Which means there's
no search team

20:03.370 --> 20:04.771
being sent to look for Jamie.

20:04.804 --> 20:05.805
Hey, Mitch, no one's

20:05.838 --> 20:07.240
giving up on Jamie, okay?

20:07.274 --> 20:08.608
We will find a way to...

20:08.641 --> 20:10.377
No one is gonna
waste any resources

20:10.410 --> 20:11.987
looking for a redhead
lost in the woods, right?

20:12.011 --> 20:14.847
REPORTER: Another development
in this ongoing investigation.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.684
Right? And this information
is coming to us live.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.353
Authorities have discovered
five more unexplained deaths

20:20.387 --> 20:22.855
in Geneva,
bringing the total count to 427.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.292
We're getting
unconfirmed reports

20:25.325 --> 20:27.994
that each of the victims
suffered strange burns.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.796
So other people died
just like Eleanor?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.431
It would appear so.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.442
Well, then maybe this is
bigger than General Davies.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.867
MITCH: Or smaller.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.904
What's that?

20:40.340 --> 20:43.009
That is Eleanor's
cerebrospinal fluid.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.546
What are those?

20:46.579 --> 20:47.980
Check this out.

20:52.051 --> 20:55.054
There was an ant inside
Eleanor's spine when she died?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.524
So the ants killed her?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.326
Maybe. But how?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.366
Just send me somewhere
that has flights

21:06.399 --> 21:08.435
back to my base in Sao Paulo.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.703
The U.S. base in Sao
Paulo was decommissioned.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.305
(phone rings) Are
you kidding me?

21:12.339 --> 21:13.340
(speaking German)

21:13.373 --> 21:14.741
Look, I've got to get back

21:14.774 --> 21:16.309
to my commanding officer.
Just tell me

21:16.343 --> 21:18.044
where home is,
and I'll send you there.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.055
I don't want to go home.
I want to go back to my unit.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.382
You don't have parents, family?

21:22.415 --> 21:23.659
Wherever there are
people waiting for you,

21:23.683 --> 21:25.352
I can send you there.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.787
You're not listening to me!
There's nobody!

21:27.820 --> 21:30.457
There's no place to send me!
I don't have anywhere to go!

21:30.490 --> 21:32.592
I want to speak to a U.S.
military representative.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.599
Hey, Lieutenant!

21:39.632 --> 21:41.868
I need your help.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.841
(indistinct chatter)

22:14.901 --> 22:16.803
Soldier.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.407
As you were. Where you heading?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.950
I, uh...
I was recalled stateside, sir.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.376
Now, why do you look so upset?

22:23.410 --> 22:24.944
You're not in any trouble.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.779
Just don't want
to miss my train.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.416
Come here, I want to talk
to you about something.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.819
(indistinct
announcement over P.A.)

22:36.756 --> 22:39.692
Eleanor Lewis' laptop and
files, where are they?

22:39.726 --> 22:42.395
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.897
Oh, I think you do, Lieutenant.

22:50.069 --> 22:53.573
You killed her, didn't you?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.442
Because she wanted to
stop the Noah Objective.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.777
I didn't kill Eleanor.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.646
As far as we can
tell, the animals did.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.957
That's why the Noah Objective
is so important, Lieutenant,

23:01.981 --> 23:04.617
so we can stop all
this senseless loss.

23:04.651 --> 23:08.154
Now, I won't write
you up in my report,

23:08.187 --> 23:10.156
but I need to know
where that laptop is.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.858
(sighs)

23:11.891 --> 23:13.493
I didn't take it.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.761
Really.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.666
I believe you.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.544
Damn it.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.466
(screaming in distance)

23:53.500 --> 23:55.034
(electricity crackling)

24:00.707 --> 24:03.710
(electricity
continues crackling)

24:26.032 --> 24:27.500
(droning)

24:35.542 --> 24:36.809
What the hell?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.059
JACKSON: You know the, uh,
social structure of ants

24:44.083 --> 24:46.519
is actually quite similar
to that of humans?

24:46.553 --> 24:49.556
Male ants, for
example, will mate with

24:49.589 --> 24:53.626
attractive new female ants even
if they're from an enemy colony.

24:53.660 --> 24:57.063
(laughs)

24:57.096 --> 25:00.900
You know, not everything
is about mating, rafiki.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.101
Mmm.

25:02.134 --> 25:05.037
Dariela has an
intriguing combination of

25:05.071 --> 25:06.973
strength and beauty.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.543
What does it matter?

25:10.577 --> 25:12.311
I'm never going
to see her again.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.746
CHLOE: Okay.

25:13.780 --> 25:17.116
We'll be there as
soon as we can.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.117
That was Dariela.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.086
W... What does she want?

25:20.119 --> 25:21.688
MITCH: Yeah, and

25:21.721 --> 25:23.766
why do we care?
CHLOE: She wants to show us something,

25:23.790 --> 25:26.058
says it's important to
what we're working on.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.628
Well, so is that creature
formerly known as Janos Kovacs,

25:28.661 --> 25:31.130
but that didn't stop her from
putting a bullet in his brain.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.198
I'll go with you.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.144
Oh, I-I don't need any help.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.851
ABRAHAM: That's strange.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.987
They all seem determined to
move in that one direction.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.938
And it looks like they're
being drawn to something.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.230
But what?

26:05.765 --> 26:07.934
I have no idea.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.702
I could ponder that for a while,

26:09.736 --> 26:11.671
but I'd rather ponder this.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.245
Mitch.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.880
What?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.953
Jamie would have wanted you
to finish what we began.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.120
Oh.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.198
Now you're going to tell me
what Jamie would've wanted?

26:30.222 --> 26:31.357
Hmm?

26:31.390 --> 26:33.660
After you left her out there
in the middle of nowhere?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.762
You think I wanted to?

26:35.795 --> 26:37.063
I made a difficult call.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.097
To save your life.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.632
I didn't need saving. She did.

26:39.666 --> 26:40.900
She was my friend, too.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.135
I don't see any
evidence of that.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.404
How dare you assume
that your pain

26:45.437 --> 26:47.139
is more important than ours?!

26:47.173 --> 26:49.208
Cuts deeper than ours!

26:49.241 --> 26:52.344
The grief of losing Jamie
does not belong to you alone!

26:52.378 --> 26:53.946
(electricity crackling)

26:56.883 --> 26:58.651
What?

26:58.685 --> 27:00.186
(crackling intensifies)

27:05.224 --> 27:07.326
(siren wailing)

27:07.359 --> 27:09.829
Where's the scientist guy?
You didn't bring him?

27:09.862 --> 27:12.231
Surprisingly,
he's not a big fan of your work.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.033
Why did you call?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.334
Believe me, I didn't want to.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.303
But that's the thing
about having no options...

27:17.336 --> 27:19.456
It makes you call people you
hope you never see again.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.909
I know, I'm really charming.
Okay, tell us.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.377
There's something
very weird here.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.379
The transformer's
been magnetized.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.049
All this stuff is stuck to it.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.720
(sniffs) You smell that?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.187
The smell is what's interesting?

27:35.221 --> 27:36.756
Sulfur.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.157
CHLOE: From an explosive?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.359
Uh... maybe.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.730
What are you looking for?

27:43.763 --> 27:45.965
Ants. Ants?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.767
That's right.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.703
Dead ants give off a...

27:50.737 --> 27:52.304
(sniffs) sulfur smell,

27:52.338 --> 27:54.382
so you'd think with a smell
this strong that... excuse me...

27:54.406 --> 27:57.409
You know, there'd be, uh...
yeah, look.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.813
See?

28:00.847 --> 28:02.114
Ants.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.884
DARIELA: I don't get it.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.357
What could ants have
to do with this?

28:06.385 --> 28:09.321
I don't know, but they were
all over Eleanor's hotel room.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.890
(rumbling,
electricity crackling)

28:24.036 --> 28:25.371
Hey.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.173
I thought you could
only see an oasis

28:27.206 --> 28:28.741
in a desert.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.342
You got a low bar for an oasis.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.945
I'm just trying
to stay positive.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.922
(panting)

28:49.796 --> 28:51.263
Hey, it's a stove.

28:51.297 --> 28:54.000
We should get some firewood
before the storm hits.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.868
No, you need to
stay off that foot.

28:55.902 --> 28:56.903
I'm fine, I can do it.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.437
I'll go.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.906
Just sit.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.207
Rest.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.860
(soft grunt)

29:26.298 --> 29:28.868
You see a lantern in here?

29:30.069 --> 29:31.537
(sighs)

29:40.412 --> 29:41.848
(cell phone rings)

29:41.881 --> 29:44.283
What a minute, hold on,
I got Abe here. Yeah?

29:44.316 --> 29:45.818
Have you heard about
the explosions?

29:45.852 --> 29:47.295
JACKSON: Yeah,
we just saw one of them.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.021
There's dead ants everywhere.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.823
They're generating electricity.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.291
What are you talking about?

29:52.324 --> 29:53.969
The ants we collected.
They can generate electricity,

29:53.993 --> 29:55.527
that's how they're
killing people.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.297
Hold on, you're saying ants
are electrocuting people?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.466
MITCH: Yup,
that's what happened to Eleanor.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.134
Enough of these ants together

30:02.168 --> 30:04.403
could generate a powerful
enough charge to...

30:04.436 --> 30:05.537
To blow up a transformer.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.574
DARIELA: First people, now transformers...
what's next?

30:08.607 --> 30:10.076
Ants move in a straight line.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.244
Where were the other explosions?

30:12.278 --> 30:14.146
MITCH: Power station.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.848
Near Parc Trembley, next one was

30:15.882 --> 30:18.885
just over the border in, um, Les...
Pu...

30:18.918 --> 30:20.386
Pugin... Pugins.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.220
Les Pugins.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.022
ABRAHAM: We've
mapped all the deaths

30:23.055 --> 30:24.256
caused by the ants,

30:24.290 --> 30:25.892
including Eleanor.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.960
They all fall along
the same line.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.862
(electricity crackling) W...

30:29.896 --> 30:31.931
What if all the ants in Geneva

30:31.964 --> 30:33.175
were heading to the same place?

30:33.199 --> 30:35.201
MITCH: The Large
Particle Accelerator.

30:35.234 --> 30:38.337
It runs underground,
it's the largest machine in the world.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.439
It collides subatomic particles.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.441
Helps us understand
the laws of nature.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.219
(inhales deeply) The
incidents all seem to be

30:44.243 --> 30:45.912
heading in a straight
line right for it.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.447
But why? MITCH: I don't know.
Certain kinds of ants

30:48.480 --> 30:50.082
are drawn to electrical systems,

30:50.116 --> 30:51.984
and these ants have
the phase two mutation.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.461
If you think they're gonna
attack the accelerator,

30:53.485 --> 30:55.988
we should evacuate people.
It won't help.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.957
If all these ants make
it to the accelerator

30:57.990 --> 30:59.525
and generate a
strong enough charge,

30:59.558 --> 31:02.328
they could create a
runaway fusion reaction.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.896
Which would kill

31:03.930 --> 31:06.232
every living thing within
a thousand-mile radius.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.916
LOGAN: Jamie! (gasps)

31:25.717 --> 31:27.286
Don't do this!

31:32.724 --> 31:34.593
(grunting)

31:36.028 --> 31:36.595
Damn it.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.931
I'm trying to help you.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.699
Okay?

31:40.732 --> 31:41.667
You looked through my bag.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.103
Yeah, and I saw pictures of me.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.471
What the hell is going on?

31:45.504 --> 31:46.939
What do you want from me?

31:46.973 --> 31:48.374
Nothing.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.209
It was never about you.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.543
It was about the leopard.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.212
What?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.646
What, were you gonna steal it?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.983
Auction it off,
sell it on the black market?

31:57.016 --> 31:58.617
I don't know, okay?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.152
I was a pilot.

32:00.186 --> 32:03.022
Some guys hired me
to fly 'em up here.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.232
Please, it's freezing out here.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.992
If you're a pilot,
where's your plane?

32:06.025 --> 32:08.694
It's in pieces.
It was a float plane.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.197
By the time I got back
to where we docked it,

32:11.230 --> 32:12.631
the animals had torn it apart.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.700
And I grabbed my cash
and I just bolted.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.468
Where are the guys
that hired you?

32:16.502 --> 32:18.204
I don't know.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.477
Look, they took off when the
animals attacked your house.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.574
Why's a pilot carrying a gun?

32:22.608 --> 32:25.677
Have you noticed what's
going on out here?

32:25.711 --> 32:28.380
You can't walk 30 feet without
some creature attacking you.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.149
That's what the gun's for.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.750
That's it.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.062
And call me nuts, Jamie,
but I would think me having a gun

32:34.086 --> 32:35.521
would be a good thing to you.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.489
I mean, unless you're
gonna defend yourself

32:37.523 --> 32:38.957
with your one good foot.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.395
Can we please go
back to the cabin?

32:43.429 --> 32:45.231
Yeah, sure.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.765
When you give me the gun.
Really?

32:46.798 --> 32:49.968
Yeah, really.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.682
(indistinct
conversations in French)

33:07.786 --> 33:09.655
Do you realize how
crazy this sounds?

33:09.688 --> 33:10.722
Yes, I do.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.691
We hear this all the time.

33:12.724 --> 33:13.935
FEMALE SCIENTIST: But if the
ants are being drawn here,

33:13.959 --> 33:16.662
the highest concentration of
energy is the collision point.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.531
Collision point?
That doesn't sound ominous at all.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.767
What the hell is
she even doing here?

33:21.800 --> 33:22.634
This place must have a way

33:22.668 --> 33:24.046
of dispersing all that
energy, right?

33:24.070 --> 33:25.204
ABRAHAM: Maybe we can use

33:25.237 --> 33:27.739
the accelerator's own
system to dissipate

33:27.773 --> 33:30.176
the ants' energy.
FEMALE SCIENTIST: Oh, that may work.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.777
But diverting that much power

33:31.810 --> 33:33.521
will require manual override.
Where's the override?

33:33.545 --> 33:35.781
That way. It's a wall console

33:35.814 --> 33:37.359
in between the fourth
and fifth stations.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.285
Get to the override.
I'll evacuate them.

33:39.318 --> 33:40.752
I'll go with them.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.089
Great, maybe you can find
something else to shoot.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.523
(alarm blaring)

33:44.556 --> 33:46.268
DARIELA: Are you saying
the ants are smart enough

33:46.292 --> 33:48.094
to know that they
can cause this...

33:48.127 --> 33:49.637
what's it called?
Runaway fusion reaction,

33:49.661 --> 33:52.098
and no, they're not that
self-aware, it's more like

33:52.131 --> 33:53.232
a biological imperative.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.102
Whoa.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.170
(ants chittering)

34:00.506 --> 34:02.141
MITCH: There, just...

34:02.174 --> 34:03.551
back up,
don't let them anywhere near you.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.177
(grunts)

34:06.412 --> 34:09.648
(ants squeak and trill)

34:20.126 --> 34:21.293
Did you see that?

34:22.860 --> 34:24.530
Yeah, I did.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.802
CHLOE: Where are the others?

34:30.835 --> 34:32.271
They just passed station four.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.308
ABRAHAM (softly): Oh, my God.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.411
Jackson.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.813
The ants are right behind you.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.849
Don't let them get near you.
You have to hurry!

34:43.882 --> 34:45.260
I know,
we just saw a river of them.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.752
I'll let you know
when we're there.

34:46.784 --> 34:47.853
Hold tight.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.360
(door closes)

34:55.393 --> 34:57.463
(panting) Hey,
we're at the collision point.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.366
(loud rattling, clanging)

35:02.734 --> 35:03.835
Time to find this override.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.747
We're at the fourth station,
it's got to be over there.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.215
CHLOE: You need to
look for a red door.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.208
MITCH: We don't
throw that override,

35:09.241 --> 35:10.776
the accelerator won't be able

35:10.809 --> 35:12.478
to absorb the ants' energy.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.222
No one said it would be locked.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.193
Yo, lab rat.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.627
Found something to shoot.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.235
DARIELA: Hurry up!

35:38.937 --> 35:40.306
They're closing in!

35:41.240 --> 35:42.341
Come on.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.911
Can you do this? Just throw it.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.322
(electricity crackling)

35:56.355 --> 35:59.391
(ants chittering)

35:59.425 --> 36:00.659
Holy crap.

36:00.692 --> 36:01.960
Jackson?

36:01.993 --> 36:03.695
Charge it up.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.331
(grunting)

36:07.266 --> 36:08.099
Hurry!

36:08.133 --> 36:10.469
All right,
there's gonna be a shockwave.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.737
(electricity charging up)

36:11.770 --> 36:14.373
JACKSON: Get ready.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.613
(all grunt, groan)

36:22.748 --> 36:24.583
(electricity winds down)

36:28.520 --> 36:30.289
You guys okay?

36:30.322 --> 36:32.258
Did we win?

36:34.293 --> 36:35.994
(coughs, gags)

36:36.027 --> 36:39.698
Dariela. (panting): I think I might've
swallowed one of those bastards.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.967
(continues coughing, gagging)

36:52.344 --> 36:53.279
Easy.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.381
I know.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.416
Somebody's got to look at your
foot, though.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.289
Oh, wow.

37:03.322 --> 37:04.456
That's not good.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.769
MITCH: Hurry up.

37:17.803 --> 37:18.970
I don't have much time.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.272
I can feel the damn thing.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.010
You're gonna be all right.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.681
MITCH: Okay.

37:29.715 --> 37:30.882
Put those on her temples.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.520
And that...

37:34.553 --> 37:35.987
is the current (reader buzzes)

37:36.021 --> 37:37.623
that the ant is generating.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.336
Should I be worried that
you guys know how to build

37:41.360 --> 37:42.861
an electric chair?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.596
Right now you
should be grateful.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.332
(grunts)

37:46.365 --> 37:48.934
MITCH: We are gonna
fry this little sucker.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.702
Blow its fuse before...

37:50.736 --> 37:52.471
Before it can blow mine.
I got it.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.607
You sure this will work?

37:57.075 --> 37:58.310
Uh... yeah, sort of.

38:04.716 --> 38:05.951
Are you ready?

38:05.984 --> 38:07.953
(reader squeals,
then stops) Do it.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.888
Clear!

38:09.921 --> 38:11.723
(electricity buzzes loudly)

38:14.493 --> 38:15.727
No.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.429
No, I can't do that.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.630
You have to.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.644
(electricity buzzes,
Dariela groans)

38:22.668 --> 38:23.911
(electricity winds
down, then stops)

38:23.935 --> 38:26.472
(reader squeals, then buzzes)

38:26.505 --> 38:29.775
(buzzing intensifies)

38:29.808 --> 38:30.848
Yeah, he's still in there.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.945
Got to go again.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.113
Clear!

38:35.146 --> 38:36.648
(electricity buzzes loudly)

38:40.051 --> 38:42.621
So I guess this
means you trust me.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.523
I'm working on it.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.325
Wait!

38:47.359 --> 38:49.695
My foot's numb,
so it's not gonna hurt, right?

38:49.728 --> 38:51.363
Wrong.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.599
Your-your... your girlfriend.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.044
The one you said was
killed by wolves.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.438
Kelly. Was she even real?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.409
(screams) (electricity
winds down)

39:03.442 --> 39:06.745
(Dariela groans lightly) MITCH:
Okay, put 'em up.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.481
(reader squeals) Guys,
I think we're pissing it off.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.550
It's charging up.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.652
(buzzing intensifies)

39:13.685 --> 39:15.654
Try again! It could kill you.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.389
Not if the ant kills me first.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.124
(Dariela panting)

39:19.157 --> 39:21.092
Do it! Clear!

39:21.126 --> 39:22.561
(electricity buzzes loudly)

39:27.098 --> 39:29.167
(electricity winds
down, then stops)

39:29.200 --> 39:30.736
Okay.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.404
Put 'em on, put 'em on.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.406
ABRAHAM: Dariela.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.107
Dariela.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.777
Dariela! We're good.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.712
(reader clicks off)
The ant's dead.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.084
But she's got no pulse.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.386
Okay, get her...
Get her on the floor. Dariela!

39:52.758 --> 39:53.859
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.494
Got to clear the airway.
I got this!

40:02.668 --> 40:05.437
Come on, come on.

40:05.471 --> 40:06.638
(grunting)

40:12.611 --> 40:14.480
(gasps)

40:14.513 --> 40:18.183
(coughing, groans)

40:18.216 --> 40:20.852
(Dariela panting)

40:23.489 --> 40:25.824
Did it work?

40:25.857 --> 40:27.726
(chuckles)

40:27.759 --> 40:30.128
Good news is yes.
And the bad news is?

40:30.161 --> 40:31.897
You might have a dead ant

40:31.930 --> 40:34.165
floating around
inside you somewhere.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.467
(exhales)

40:36.868 --> 40:38.103
It's okay.

40:45.911 --> 40:48.146
We're happy to drop
you wherever you want.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.181
Unless you'd consider staying.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.719
Listen,
I know we have our differences,

40:53.752 --> 40:55.162
but I think we can
use someone like you.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.689
Because I shoot
stuff for a living?

40:57.723 --> 40:58.890
Among other qualities.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.527
I want to get back to my unit.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.862
Military is what I
know, it's home to me.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.172
But after everything
I've seen...

41:05.196 --> 41:06.598
With all the animals...

41:06.632 --> 41:07.899
Not just the animals.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.935
At the train station, I saw a U.S.
general

41:09.968 --> 41:11.236
murder one of his own men.

41:11.269 --> 41:12.170
A U.S. general?

41:12.203 --> 41:14.105
Yeah, before you guys got there.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.611
Was it this man?

41:19.645 --> 41:21.179
Yeah, that's him.

41:21.212 --> 41:23.181
He thought the soldier

41:23.214 --> 41:24.550
had stolen files from...

41:24.583 --> 41:26.885
Eleanor something.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.820
Whatever they were,
he wanted them back badly.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.535
Chloe would kill me for this,

41:43.569 --> 41:45.937
but, uh...

41:45.971 --> 41:47.314
there's something
I should tell you.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.940
Yeah.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.208
There is.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.616
Here.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.018
I've got a link in one
of her deleted files.

42:00.051 --> 42:02.554
You think it's what Eleanor
wanted to talk to you about?

42:02.588 --> 42:03.655
Could be.

42:07.092 --> 42:09.260
What is this thing?

42:09.294 --> 42:11.597
Some sort of demonstration.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.802
This is how many animals
they expect to eliminate

42:16.835 --> 42:18.236
with the Noah Objective.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.271
What are those white dots?

42:20.305 --> 42:22.574
Those are human casualties.

42:22.608 --> 42:25.143
Oh, my God.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.078
(computer alert beeping) See?

42:27.112 --> 42:29.080
Someone's accessing
the TX-14 server.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.251
Over two million people will die

42:33.284 --> 42:35.286
if the Noah Objective
goes forward.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.255
And Davies knows it.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.890
So General Davies knows

42:38.924 --> 42:42.594
his big animal solution will
also kill millions of people.

42:42.628 --> 42:43.962
What the hell are we gonna do?

42:43.995 --> 42:45.263
We're gonna stop him.

42:45.296 --> 42:47.565
Shut it down now.
