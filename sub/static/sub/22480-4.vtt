00:00.001 --> 00:01.242
We're infiltrating a white power group.

00:01.322 --> 00:04.839
Rosa runs Magyar Ultra, alongside
her younger brother, Josef.

00:04.919 --> 00:07.580
Find out what Jane Lowry wants with
these people, before it's too late.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.660
He found out the name your
target is hiding under.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.088
He'll have grabbed him by nightfall.

00:13.502 --> 00:15.307
Who is he? Why is he so important?

00:16.518 --> 00:19.036
You may have been infiltrated. Clean...

00:19.116 --> 00:20.794
- Something here feels wrong.
- ...your...

00:20.874 --> 00:22.234
Prove how little he means to you.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.321
...house.

00:24.961 --> 00:27.992
They've got the target and McAllister.
Cover's blown. They've got Mac.

01:42.405 --> 01:45.330
- Ultra!
- Ultra! Ultra!

01:48.725 --> 01:53.197
- We need to get rid of him.
- No, we need to find out who he is.

01:53.943 --> 01:55.365
What does it matter now?

02:57.997 --> 02:59.839
- Josef!
- Roland!

03:00.573 --> 03:03.645
I heard things got a little
loud at the hospital. You OK?

03:03.725 --> 03:06.826
- 12 men, including Florian.
- Jesus.

03:06.906 --> 03:10.151
- Do you know who the hostiles are with?
- No, but I will soon.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.255
Welcome to paradise, friend.

03:18.535 --> 03:20.948
Ultra! Ultra! Ultra!

03:29.996 --> 03:32.488
- It's not going to be enough.
- It's all we've got.

03:32.568 --> 03:34.140
Any idea what kind of
numbers we're up against?

03:34.220 --> 03:36.799
Hard to say. Could be anything up to 100.

03:36.879 --> 03:40.305
Jensen pulled up the intel on the
plot of land owned by a Roland Eder.

03:40.385 --> 03:43.409
Apparently it's some sort of
Magyar Ultra training ground.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.223
- They're going to be ready for us.
- Not if we stay off the trails.

03:46.303 --> 03:47.799
I grew up around people like this.

03:47.879 --> 03:50.735
Waiting for the day the big, bad
government comes to take them away.

03:50.815 --> 03:54.991
Armed soldiers, black helicopters.
New world order. All that shit.

03:55.071 --> 03:58.204
Well, on the bright side,
looks like they were right.

03:58.284 --> 03:59.515
Comms check.

03:59.595 --> 04:03.890
Good check. It's quite the
hike, so you need to get moving.

04:03.970 --> 04:07.511
Grab McAllister, Lowry's target,
and bring them both back home safe.

04:07.591 --> 04:09.277
- Good luck.
- Copy.

04:09.357 --> 04:11.357
Sounds so simple when she says it.

04:39.817 --> 04:41.450
Subtitles by explosiveskull

04:54.251 --> 04:58.686
- What's your name?
- Ilyas Zarin.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.086
Your real name.

05:02.938 --> 05:04.458
Who do you work for?

05:05.741 --> 05:08.135
The important thing is I can help you.

05:08.215 --> 05:10.867
I would worry more about yourself.

05:11.495 --> 05:15.052
I'm just a product to be
taken and sold, but you...

05:15.975 --> 05:17.922
You are something worse to them.

05:22.478 --> 05:23.436
Let's go.

05:26.162 --> 05:29.119
Nice tattoo. Draw that yourself?

05:30.282 --> 05:31.722
Mark of distinction.

05:32.953 --> 05:36.701
It means a man has done his
time. Kept his mouth shut.

05:36.781 --> 05:40.711
Or he's broken his cherry.
Put someone in the ground.

05:42.099 --> 05:46.805
- If you say so.
- Are you running things around here, then?

05:46.885 --> 05:48.946
Or are you Josef's little lapdog?

05:54.551 --> 05:58.968
We are all brothers up
here. Bound by blood.

06:06.295 --> 06:09.136
Easy, there. Easy.

06:26.996 --> 06:28.640
Zarin needs to be delivered by noon.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.925
We should be preparing him for the drop.

06:31.005 --> 06:32.483
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

06:32.563 --> 06:34.815
If the client wants him that badly
they'll be willing to pay more.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.865
No. Josef, this is not a game.

06:37.945 --> 06:40.495
You don't know them, they
won't accept this deal.

06:40.575 --> 06:42.363
People died for this.

06:42.443 --> 06:46.495
We need more money for weapons,
vehicles, to expand the land to be ready.

06:46.575 --> 06:48.615
A life worth living is worth fighting for.

06:53.293 --> 06:54.959
Get ready for your close-up.

07:01.568 --> 07:04.848
I am the one you have been looking for.

07:05.406 --> 07:08.076
However, the terms have changed.

07:08.156 --> 07:10.593
The price has doubled.

07:12.194 --> 07:14.126
$500,000.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.819
It's a slight delay, that's all.

07:17.899 --> 07:21.655
Rosa, don't make me come and get him.

07:21.735 --> 07:23.415
We found the man you wanted within a week.

07:23.495 --> 07:26.293
Others had been searching
for him for a lot longer.

07:26.373 --> 07:29.092
- This won't be a problem.
- Your brother could be, though.

07:29.172 --> 07:31.615
If he finds out you've
been dealing with me.

07:31.695 --> 07:35.735
- Don't worry, I can handle him.
- You said that he'd taken a hostage.

07:35.815 --> 07:37.735
The infiltrator.

07:37.815 --> 07:40.895
Well, I've looked into it,
and it's worse than you think.

07:41.013 --> 07:42.390
It's British military.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.540
What?

07:45.620 --> 07:47.375
There will be more on the way.

07:47.455 --> 07:51.940
Now, I told you before to clean
your house. So you listen to me.

08:12.782 --> 08:14.733
So, who is it you are working for?

08:16.211 --> 08:17.811
Where does all this end, Josef?

08:19.055 --> 08:22.215
You've got guys stockpiling guns
and ammo out there. Training.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.678
It ends with our country
being our own again.

08:26.584 --> 08:28.746
White genocide isn't some myth.

08:29.371 --> 08:31.129
And there is nothing more righteous

08:31.209 --> 08:32.724
than the preservation of one's own race.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.813
You think all them out there are
racially pure? That's bullshit.

08:35.893 --> 08:38.645
Even I can tell you that, and I
don't give a shit about your cause.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.663
- They believe in what they are doing.
- And what about Rosa?

08:44.001 --> 08:47.121
- Does she believe in it, too?
- We started all this together.

08:48.346 --> 08:50.546
So how come she's got
you working for the enemy?

08:56.135 --> 09:00.046
Jane Lowry. As in, the
widow of Omair Idrisi.

09:01.132 --> 09:03.774
Why do you think she's kept you
away from the client all this time?

09:07.899 --> 09:10.334
Not bad. Very inventive.

09:10.935 --> 09:13.290
I was wondering what
lies you'd fall back on.

09:14.648 --> 09:17.185
This is Sergeant Thomas McAllister.

09:17.265 --> 09:21.520
British Military. Active
service. Special Forces.

09:30.009 --> 09:32.741
- You just broke my heart, man.
- Get used to it.

09:32.821 --> 09:35.423
Because your sister's got you
doing dirty jobs for the jihadists.

09:35.503 --> 09:39.999
Do you really think I'm going to
believe anything you have to say?

09:40.669 --> 09:44.971
You were right. The war is
coming. You need to deal with this.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.983
Show him what we do to traitors.

09:48.556 --> 09:50.797
Take him out!

09:50.877 --> 09:54.302
And make sure all patrols are
in position and on full alert.

09:59.677 --> 10:00.960
Josef.

10:02.251 --> 10:05.810
You have been distant recently.

10:06.984 --> 10:12.163
Because I've been worried about
you. You were always angry.

10:19.385 --> 10:22.677
When we deliver Zarin, I'll
come with you. Meet the client.

10:23.906 --> 10:26.666
- If you've nothing to hide...
- Of course.

10:36.905 --> 10:39.761
Don't forget all I have done for you.

10:49.741 --> 10:53.748
Ultra! Ultra! Ultra!

10:53.828 --> 10:55.345
British military.

10:57.201 --> 10:59.981
Sent to infiltrate and bring us down.

11:00.061 --> 11:02.725
A profit of the new world order.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.003
Get him up here.

11:09.912 --> 11:12.829
Ultra! Ultra! Ultra!

11:22.149 --> 11:25.472
Josef wants you. I'll take over.

11:28.374 --> 11:30.587
You never come out this way any more, Rosa.

11:30.667 --> 11:34.014
- You think you're too good for us?
- Roland...

11:34.094 --> 11:36.560
I've always been too good for you.

11:47.450 --> 11:49.650
The camp should be 100 metres ahead.

11:49.730 --> 11:53.090
Wyatt and I will take these
two and head for the centre.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.930
Novin, once I locate Mac, I'll
need a distraction. Something big.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.730
We three need to feel like 50.

11:58.810 --> 12:01.369
- On it.
- Wyatt, wait for Novin,

12:01.449 --> 12:03.570
then we keep moving and keep firing.

12:03.650 --> 12:06.860
- Copy that.
- Make them think we're an army.

12:09.173 --> 12:11.860
Jane Lowry. Remember that name, Josef.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.807
Jane Lowry. She's playing you.

12:16.425 --> 12:17.610
Hang him!

12:33.484 --> 12:34.349
Shit.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.463
Novin. Novin!

12:49.404 --> 12:51.124
Can't wait. Taking the rope.

12:54.238 --> 12:56.444
Novin, I'm going to need
that distraction now.

12:56.524 --> 12:57.997
Any second now.

13:00.687 --> 13:01.875
Coming your way.

13:14.397 --> 13:15.436
Throw smoke!

13:18.961 --> 13:20.357
McAllister!

14:03.810 --> 14:04.810
You OK?

14:05.725 --> 14:08.732
- I've been better.
- You know where the target is?

14:08.812 --> 14:12.386
I've got a pretty good idea. I
think Rosa was heading for him.

14:12.466 --> 14:16.134
Sure you're OK? Or want to hang for a sec?

14:16.214 --> 14:18.272
Oh, very good. Very good.

14:21.272 --> 14:23.385
Got Mac. Going for the target.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.035
Moving to rendezvous. If
we're late, don't wait.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.075
Copy that.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.162
- Where's Rosa?
- Black Lodge.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.257
You sent her to look after the prisoner.

14:43.789 --> 14:45.863
I think you've flooded it, flower.

14:45.943 --> 14:48.589
- Hands up. Hands!
- Hello, handsome.

15:02.015 --> 15:05.170
Rosa! Get down, get down! Down!

15:05.250 --> 15:06.181
Go, go, go!

15:09.137 --> 15:10.375
I've got the target.

15:10.455 --> 15:13.508
'Mobile, heading north-west.
Tango is in pursuit.'

15:14.651 --> 15:17.138
After them! Go! Go!

15:25.354 --> 15:26.674
Rosa!

15:29.340 --> 15:30.774
Rosa!

16:05.256 --> 16:06.976
On the roof! Stay down!

16:26.086 --> 16:29.149
One of the men says he saw
Rosa trying to leave with Zarin.

16:29.275 --> 16:30.297
Get in!

16:31.282 --> 16:34.233
He is worth a lot to us, she
will have been protecting him.

16:34.313 --> 16:35.968
Then she did not succeed.

16:38.310 --> 16:42.424
Activate the jammer, shut down all
comms. We'll trap them in the woods.

16:43.906 --> 16:44.820
Shit.

16:45.309 --> 16:47.527
- It's buggered to shit.
- Come on, out.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.180
The man is on the roof, you
pull the trigger, the man dies,

16:50.260 --> 16:51.470
and you do not blink.

16:51.550 --> 16:54.738
- Just doing my job, mate.
- Maybe you found your calling.

16:54.818 --> 16:57.673
Maybe you should cut the bullshit
and tell us your real name.

16:57.803 --> 17:00.056
Or why someone wants to go to all
this trouble to get their hands on you.

17:00.136 --> 17:02.461
I'll get Jensen to ID him.

17:02.541 --> 17:03.622
Smile.

17:07.503 --> 17:10.161
That's no good. Not getting any reception.

17:10.241 --> 17:13.205
- Comms?
- Radio check, over.

17:14.932 --> 17:16.188
Nothing.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.444
Still nothing.

17:19.425 --> 17:20.906
All comms in the area seem to be down.

17:20.987 --> 17:23.461
Trying to get a fix on
why that might be, but...

17:33.601 --> 17:35.789
- General Laszlo.
- Colonel.

17:37.601 --> 17:41.023
You were given permission to
conduct intelligence gathering.

17:41.140 --> 17:44.178
Instead you are responsible for
several firefights around the

17:44.258 --> 17:48.583
city, including one at a hospital,
resulting in a civilian death.

17:48.663 --> 17:51.525
So, what is your aim here?

17:54.668 --> 17:57.251
We are trying to prevent
a major terror plot.

17:57.331 --> 18:01.830
- Then you will share the details with me.
- Sorry, I won't be doing that.

18:02.453 --> 18:04.174
Then I have no choice but to shut you down.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.546
General, you are making a big mistake.

18:07.626 --> 18:08.973
I have the backing of Whitehall.

18:09.053 --> 18:12.055
Remove your forces from this
country within the next two hours

18:12.135 --> 18:13.917
or face the consequences.

18:16.707 --> 18:18.025
I will sort this out.

18:31.756 --> 18:33.330
No comms makes sense.

18:34.196 --> 18:38.007
Signal jamming is pretty high on
your average survivalist wish list.

18:38.087 --> 18:39.792
Along with a shit-tonne of ammo.

18:39.872 --> 18:42.010
You said you grew up
around people like this.

18:42.090 --> 18:44.427
Just before my seventh
birthday my mom moved us

18:44.507 --> 18:46.887
up to a commune in the Pacific Northwest.

18:47.873 --> 18:49.836
They were decent enough folk.

18:49.916 --> 18:51.587
If you ignore the fact
they were batshit crazy

18:51.667 --> 18:53.924
and waiting for Armageddon to come.

18:57.238 --> 19:00.874
You already know this,
right? You've read my file.

19:00.985 --> 19:02.220
Skimmed it.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.590
Stints in rehab, psych evaluations,
not to mention numerous redactions.

19:06.716 --> 19:08.006
An interesting read.

19:08.867 --> 19:12.750
- I thought you'd be impressed.
- I think you're an excellent soldier.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.141
I'm just concerned you might
be an amateur human being.

19:18.971 --> 19:20.998
That's Donovan's MO, though, right?

19:21.078 --> 19:23.283
Surrounding herself with people
who are running out of road

19:23.363 --> 19:24.791
and looking for a break.

19:24.871 --> 19:28.230
Which brings me to the question,
Captain, what exactly is your deal?

19:28.349 --> 19:30.297
I'm the exception to the rule.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.954
Stop there! Hands up!
Hands where I can see them.

19:53.076 --> 19:54.464
Turn around, real slow.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.438
- Clean.
- You heading somewhere?

20:02.533 --> 20:03.986
I want to make a deal.

20:05.228 --> 20:08.119
Get me out of here and I'll give you
everything I've got on Jane Lowry.

20:08.199 --> 20:10.430
You expect us to believe you're suddenly
going to turn on your own people?

20:10.510 --> 20:13.298
Maybe I already have, maybe
that's why I need a way out.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.060
You've seen Josef, what he's like.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.519
Fuck!

20:18.659 --> 20:20.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Everybody
easy on the triggers.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.346
Rosa, are you all right?
Josef's been looking for you.

20:24.426 --> 20:25.898
We'll get you back to him.

20:44.162 --> 20:45.916
There is no going back!

20:47.435 --> 20:49.276
It looks like I'm coming with you.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.611
I got some systems up and running.

20:55.691 --> 20:57.923
Currently working on re-establishing
contact with the team.

20:58.003 --> 20:59.194
How are things at the ministry, Ma'am?

20:59.274 --> 21:00.992
Whitehall aren't giving us any support.

21:01.072 --> 21:03.377
As far as they're concerned,
because we haven't got any firm intel

21:03.457 --> 21:06.970
on who Zarin really is, we're
just out here on a fishing holiday.

21:07.050 --> 21:09.872
I'll meet you on Harlow Street.
I'm just cutting through.

21:09.952 --> 21:12.637
Any luck with the security
footage from the hospital?

21:17.253 --> 21:18.318
Ma'am?

21:22.899 --> 21:24.245
'Ma'am?'

21:24.371 --> 21:26.235
- 'Ma'am, can you hear me?'
- Jensen!

21:27.276 --> 21:28.516
Train station.

21:29.515 --> 21:33.031
That's how you tracked me here.
Cameras pick me up there, right?

21:34.118 --> 21:36.478
Yeah. That was careless.

21:37.056 --> 21:38.786
You'd just suffered a
loss, it's understandable.

21:38.866 --> 21:40.754
No, the basics matter.

21:42.241 --> 21:45.315
You are out on your own. It's not easy.

21:45.395 --> 21:47.865
Wait, are you trying to
sympathise with me, Colonel?

22:01.627 --> 22:06.589
I'm trying to understand.
Your own people, the jihadists,

22:06.669 --> 22:08.264
they won't work under a woman.

22:08.344 --> 22:11.094
Once they understand what's
coming, they'll change their minds.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.720
I wish you could see what comes next.

22:16.093 --> 22:17.325
I think...

22:17.498 --> 22:19.285
I think I'm trying to impress you.

22:20.759 --> 22:23.654
Don't worry. I'll get over it.

22:25.099 --> 22:26.945
- Wait.
- No more talk.

22:27.025 --> 22:27.945
Colonel!

22:32.616 --> 22:35.116
- Colonel, are you all right?
- Keep going after her!

23:13.844 --> 23:15.204
They went on foot.

23:18.540 --> 23:19.540
Josef.

23:21.709 --> 23:26.396
Philip here says he saw Rosa
with the British soldiers.

23:26.553 --> 23:28.781
Says she fired on our own people.

23:33.941 --> 23:38.258
- Why would you say such a thing?
- I swear it's true. She's with them.

23:43.183 --> 23:46.194
- Who else have you told?
- Nobody, I promise.

23:50.391 --> 23:52.881
You did the right thing, coming to me.

23:55.062 --> 23:56.344
Josef...

24:02.366 --> 24:06.977
OK, I had to. It's
important we remain unified.

24:09.158 --> 24:10.719
I will deal with this.

24:32.976 --> 24:36.129
We are cut off from our
ride. Platoons everywhere.

24:36.209 --> 24:37.504
We need to keep moving.

24:41.786 --> 24:43.066
How's Wyatt?

24:45.062 --> 24:47.049
What, you mean how is he in general?

24:47.169 --> 24:50.055
Enjoying life, eating
well and all that shit?

24:50.135 --> 24:51.924
Or how is he since you
stabbed him in the gut?

24:52.004 --> 24:54.009
I didn't have a choice.

24:54.148 --> 24:57.018
Jensen has patched him
up. Boy's got skills, eh?

24:57.776 --> 25:00.490
- And an eye on you.
- Can't blame him.

25:01.091 --> 25:05.790
But honestly, Mac, you had a
choice, and you made that choice.

25:06.642 --> 25:08.052
Probably the right one.

25:09.262 --> 25:12.245
Doesn't mean Wyatt's not going to
think twice before trusting you again.

25:12.578 --> 25:16.018
Self-preservation. It drives us all.

25:16.231 --> 25:19.458
It's the reason for wars, for all of this.

25:19.538 --> 25:21.267
So now you want to talk?

25:21.789 --> 25:24.369
You're the reason we're
all here, risking our lives.

25:24.888 --> 25:26.569
The minute comms come back
on, you're getting ID'd,

25:26.649 --> 25:29.540
and whatever secret it is you
are holding, we'll find out.

25:33.769 --> 25:36.324
We might have a way of finding
out who Zarin really is.

25:36.404 --> 25:39.774
Hungarian special forces grabbed all
the security footage from the hospital.

25:39.854 --> 25:41.320
We're checking their database.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.669
- You been spying on them?
- I prefer eavesdropping.

25:44.749 --> 25:46.257
Covert surveillance on an allied state.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.884
You know what would happen
if you'd been caught?

25:48.964 --> 25:52.269
Would they... shut us down and
force us out the country, ma'am?

25:54.799 --> 25:57.641
The night Zarin was snatched, the
cameras in the pharmacy were out.

25:57.721 --> 25:59.478
Magyar Ultra were taking precautions.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.312
But I checked previous week, same shift,

26:02.392 --> 26:04.328
alongside Novin's
description of the target,

26:04.408 --> 26:07.926
and, I think that's our man.

26:08.006 --> 26:09.950
Still checking image against
facial recognition software.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.523
No need. I know him.

26:13.001 --> 26:17.399
Dr Karim Markov. We need to get
to the team now. Let's move out.

26:17.479 --> 26:20.574
He is the last person in the world
we want Jane Lowry to get a hold of.

26:30.239 --> 26:31.279
Down!

27:02.689 --> 27:03.756
Wyatt?

27:04.769 --> 27:05.800
Mac!

27:06.355 --> 27:09.282
- Taking prisoners now?
- Says she's got information on Lowry.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.468
We can't make it to
the section vehicle now.

27:11.548 --> 27:14.507
She's given us the exact
location of the signal jammer.

27:14.587 --> 27:16.139
We take that out, we can call for exfil.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.590
And we've just alerted every
fucker in the woods to our location,

27:18.670 --> 27:20.703
so I say we move and move fast.

27:22.947 --> 27:24.828
Roland! Behind!

27:44.498 --> 27:45.538
Move.

27:59.205 --> 28:00.525
This is good.

28:04.339 --> 28:06.179
We know where they are going.

28:08.549 --> 28:11.389
Rosa will be leading
them to the signal jammer.

28:11.469 --> 28:12.979
They need their communications.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.317
And that is where we will take them down.

28:53.809 --> 28:55.249
Building's clear.

28:55.329 --> 28:58.425
- Novin's dealing with the jammer.
- Good work.

28:58.505 --> 29:00.589
Let's get some defences up.

29:00.669 --> 29:02.574
Copy.

29:02.683 --> 29:05.005
So, we're really trusting her, then?

29:05.085 --> 29:08.769
Can I just point out she tried to have
her brother lynch me a few hours ago?

29:08.895 --> 29:10.295
Well, could've been worse.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.045
She could've had someone
stick you in the gut.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.890
Oh, here we go. I knew
this was going to come up.

29:13.970 --> 29:15.781
Oh, you knew the fact that you stabbed me

29:15.861 --> 29:17.766
might actually be referenced again?

29:17.846 --> 29:20.725
That's very perceptive of you, McAllister.

29:20.805 --> 29:22.571
Look, if I hadn't done
it, we'd both be dead.

29:22.651 --> 29:24.337
That's kind of convenient
for you, though, right?

29:24.417 --> 29:27.250
I'm the one lying in
the gutter, bleeding out.

29:29.614 --> 29:32.382
- What do you want? An apology?
- An apology would be nice, yeah.

29:32.462 --> 29:33.753
I'm not apologising for doing my job.

29:33.833 --> 29:36.704
I been through this shit
before, I'm not doing it again.

29:36.784 --> 29:39.692
Either I can trust the guy
on my shoulder, or I walk.

29:39.772 --> 29:42.030
He's talking about Task Force 18.

29:44.695 --> 29:45.956
The fuck you know about that?

29:46.036 --> 29:49.132
It's not what I know, it's
Lowry and what she told me.

29:49.212 --> 29:51.062
Like your father, for example.

29:51.142 --> 29:54.506
You must have loved him very much
to cover up for him like that.

29:59.338 --> 30:02.186
If you're trying to undermine
us, you're wasting your breath.

30:02.266 --> 30:04.345
You don't need my help to do that.

30:05.077 --> 30:09.345
If you're talking about me and Norman Bates
here, you don't have to worry about that.

30:09.542 --> 30:12.605
Cos at the end of the day,
the mission comes first.

30:12.685 --> 30:15.649
And no matter how pissed I am at
him, I'm not going to forget that.

30:17.420 --> 30:20.540
Although this would be an
opportune time for you to apologise.

30:23.851 --> 30:25.171
Apology accepted.

30:27.052 --> 30:29.598
You want to prove what
a valuable asset you are,

30:29.678 --> 30:32.703
give us something solid.
Something about Lowry.

30:35.336 --> 30:37.889
Lowry paid us 20,000 in advance.

30:37.969 --> 30:40.898
Used a go-between, a banker
guy called David Amelio.

30:40.978 --> 30:43.551
We tried to check-up on
him, but he's a ghost.

30:43.631 --> 30:46.931
- And...?
- And if you want more, get me out.

30:47.581 --> 30:49.541
Captain Reynolds?

30:49.621 --> 30:52.009
I believe I am ready to talk.

30:52.112 --> 30:54.441
To you, and you alone.

30:57.341 --> 30:58.414
Get up.

31:01.765 --> 31:05.863
Dr Markov was the rising star of the
Russian chemical weapons programme.

31:06.555 --> 31:09.721
For years we'd heard this myth
about something called Novichok.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.843
A nerve gas that was
undetectable, easy to transport,

31:12.923 --> 31:15.902
and 10 times stronger
than any other strain.

31:15.982 --> 31:18.226
Markov was said to be behind it.

31:18.306 --> 31:20.653
How come he ended up working in
a hospital under an assumed name?

31:20.733 --> 31:22.682
Because Novichok wasn't a myth.

31:22.762 --> 31:24.609
The Russians were so
terrified of what they've made

31:24.689 --> 31:27.209
they blew the whistle on
themselves after Vladivostok.

31:27.289 --> 31:30.266
'There was a leak at the chemical plant
where Markov was overseeing its creation.

31:30.346 --> 31:34.558
'Every single person working there
died as a result, except Markov.

31:34.638 --> 31:36.390
'He disappeared, went dark.

31:36.470 --> 31:38.827
'It might have been an accident,
but there is a strong suspicion

31:38.907 --> 31:41.307
'that Markov deliberately
released the Novichok.

31:41.387 --> 31:43.787
'This is the man Jane Lowry wants.'

31:43.867 --> 31:44.758
So?

31:46.467 --> 31:47.867
I can't go back.

31:49.303 --> 31:52.218
I know what I am and what I'm capable of.

31:52.298 --> 31:54.973
It's like alcoholic, yes?

31:55.883 --> 31:59.816
Each day they pray... not today.

32:09.862 --> 32:11.917
Not today.

32:11.997 --> 32:12.730
You OK?

32:12.810 --> 32:15.225
Always a bad sign when
they say they want to talk.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.417
- The signal jammer?
- It's down now.

32:19.497 --> 32:22.323
Reception is patchy but I
should be able to make contact.

32:22.425 --> 32:23.465
Move.

32:25.292 --> 32:29.424
Josef, I know Rosa is blood, but
we are all blood. We are all family.

32:29.504 --> 32:31.127
I said I would always look after her.

32:31.207 --> 32:33.400
If she has betrayed us,

32:33.480 --> 32:36.089
I need to know that you're
strong enough for this.

32:39.329 --> 32:40.769
We'll know soon enough.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.516
Tell the others to get into position.

33:02.044 --> 33:05.964
Got movement in the trees. We
definitely got tangos out there.

33:06.106 --> 33:07.807
Looks like they're moving around the front.

33:11.154 --> 33:14.486
- Jensen. Jensen, can you hear me?
- Copy that, loud and clear.

33:14.566 --> 33:15.848
(HUNGARIAN NAME) water planet.

33:15.928 --> 33:18.550
North-west of the forest, I've
got the target and a prisoner.

33:18.630 --> 33:19.713
I need an exfil now, man.

33:19.793 --> 33:22.224
'Currently en route, should
be 10-15 minutes cross-country.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.381
'Novin, if it looks like you're
going to lose the target,'

33:24.461 --> 33:27.668
terminate him. Do not take
any chances. Are we clear?

33:29.404 --> 33:30.404
Copy that.

33:48.924 --> 33:50.855
- Tangos inbound.
- Heads down.

34:10.911 --> 34:12.068
Hold.

34:15.637 --> 34:16.978
Hold.

34:21.994 --> 34:23.043
Three...

34:25.446 --> 34:26.806
...two...

34:28.484 --> 34:29.603
...one.

34:59.266 --> 35:00.302
I'm out!

35:37.732 --> 35:38.852
Fall back!

35:40.492 --> 35:41.664
Grenade!

35:46.802 --> 35:47.802
Stay with me.

35:56.273 --> 35:57.395
Changing!

35:58.419 --> 35:59.499
Stairs!

36:16.682 --> 36:20.679
- Josef, I'm sorry.
- Roland, please. You used to be strong.

36:20.759 --> 36:23.154
You have forgotten who
your real family are.

36:23.234 --> 36:24.265
Wait.

36:24.345 --> 36:25.661
Roland, please wait.

36:59.989 --> 37:01.389
Ceasefire!

37:03.436 --> 37:05.024
McAllister!

37:06.070 --> 37:08.030
Josef, tell your men to stand down.

37:09.871 --> 37:11.594
Do that and we'll let Rosa go.

37:14.502 --> 37:17.089
Is she your hostage or
is she your passenger?

37:17.864 --> 37:19.544
We can all walk out of this.

37:23.204 --> 37:25.364
Rosa, tell me the truth. Jane Lowry.

37:28.784 --> 37:30.848
I did it for us.

37:39.113 --> 37:40.113
No.

37:43.381 --> 37:44.981
We lost men.

37:46.672 --> 37:47.995
They died for this.

37:49.175 --> 37:52.355
For this man. For the fucking enemy!

37:52.435 --> 37:55.118
There is no enemy, Josef, there never was.

37:55.198 --> 37:59.863
There is only the rich and
the poor, and I wanted better.

38:04.460 --> 38:05.807
Better?

38:09.989 --> 38:11.909
I protected you, I...

38:12.964 --> 38:16.798
- I did everything for you!
- But you didn't let me go.

38:49.023 --> 38:50.343
You, on me!

39:01.843 --> 39:03.896
Sorry, I've got my orders.

39:05.512 --> 39:08.681
- Go, go, go!
- Novin, exfil, move!

39:08.761 --> 39:10.714
Get in the car, go!

39:26.294 --> 39:28.418
Move it! Come on!

39:32.601 --> 39:33.961
Go, go, go!

40:10.226 --> 40:11.703
Dr Markov.

40:14.945 --> 40:15.918
Ma'am...

40:31.197 --> 40:33.518
I believe you have a man in
your custody who is wanted under

40:33.598 --> 40:36.004
the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention.

40:36.084 --> 40:37.333
We're bringing him in.

40:37.919 --> 40:40.919
He is a war criminal, and
he's in our jurisdiction.

40:40.999 --> 40:43.844
But your assistance is highly
appreciated in the matter.

40:43.924 --> 40:45.549
How good are your men, Laszlo?

40:45.629 --> 40:47.964
Cos I'd put my people against them any day.

40:48.044 --> 40:49.167
Colonel, please.

40:50.684 --> 40:52.308
Imagine this the other way around.

40:52.388 --> 40:55.724
My men running unauthorised
operations on British soil.

40:55.804 --> 40:58.590
Pitched gun battles. Deaths.

40:59.598 --> 41:03.078
I'm only protecting my country,
and you would do the same.

41:03.189 --> 41:06.612
Your Foreign Secretary
seems to agree with me.

41:09.818 --> 41:12.235
- What do you think is going on?
- Nothing good.

41:22.085 --> 41:25.639
We need to give them Markov.
Whitehall's cut a deal.

41:25.740 --> 41:28.558
We hand over Markov, the Hungarians
get the credit for finding him.

41:28.638 --> 41:31.279
In 24 hours' time, he is
back under our command.

41:31.388 --> 41:32.954
I'm sorry, we have no choice on this one.

41:33.034 --> 41:35.634
- There is always a choice, right?
- It's a direct order.

41:49.481 --> 41:50.840
Son of a bitch.

42:37.940 --> 42:39.494
Shit! Get down!

43:04.185 --> 43:06.048
Karim Markov.

43:10.768 --> 43:11.868
Come.

43:31.675 --> 43:32.881
Seat belt.

43:38.443 --> 43:39.778
All right, then.

43:55.854 --> 43:58.433
Please tell me this plan
involves kicking in some doors.

43:59.899 --> 44:01.308
Choose a target...

44:01.415 --> 44:03.615
Pest control, at your service.

44:03.695 --> 44:04.855
...pull the trigger...

44:08.737 --> 44:10.417
...and become a man.
