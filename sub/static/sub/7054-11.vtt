00:00.665 --> 00:02.525
Previously in Fringe...

00:02.645 --> 00:04.960
The First People... You're holding
one of the last copies.

00:05.080 --> 00:07.056
What are we talking about?
Adam and Eve?

00:07.124 --> 00:08.308
No, before dinosaurs.

00:08.392 --> 00:09.676
They were the first people.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.312
"They were a people of
great technological prowess

00:12.432 --> 00:14.150
who made
the ultimate discovery."

00:14.439 --> 00:15.445
Walternate had said

00:15.565 --> 00:18.217
that it was a very powerful
piece of ancient tech.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.689
This machine is dangerous.

00:19.749 --> 00:21.167
Which is why
we need to understand it.

00:21.234 --> 00:23.002
When I touched that
device on the other side,

00:23.086 --> 00:25.171
it came alive in my hands.

00:25.255 --> 00:27.673
How can you expect me
to ignore that?

00:27.741 --> 00:29.375
Walter didn't have
brain tissue implanted.

00:29.459 --> 00:30.376
He had it removed.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.177
What are you doing, Walter?

00:32.262 --> 00:33.495
I'm making myself smarter.

00:33.563 --> 00:35.163
If I can think
like Walternate,

00:35.215 --> 00:37.016
I can figure out
what he's trying to do

00:37.100 --> 00:38.517
with that device.

00:38.585 --> 00:40.603
The picture
of me in the device.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.771
What does it mean?

00:42.839 --> 00:44.690
What's going to happen to me?

01:08.965 --> 01:11.166
Clearance and I.D.

01:19.476 --> 01:21.427
Do you have any chewing gum?

01:21.511 --> 01:22.461
Excuse me?

01:22.529 --> 01:23.479
I'm sorry.

01:23.546 --> 01:24.964
He's got this thing
with his ears.

01:25.031 --> 01:26.381
It's not a thing with my ears.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.767
I've got a blocked
eustachian tube.

01:28.835 --> 01:30.903
And it's a perfectly
natural reaction.

01:30.987 --> 01:32.187
Any flavor will do,

01:32.239 --> 01:34.473
although I'm rather
partial to grape.

01:34.541 --> 01:36.242
Welcome back, colonel Broyles.

01:41.230 --> 01:44.533
We've tried a dozen
different power sources.

01:44.584 --> 01:46.285
And there were
no reactions at all?

01:46.369 --> 01:47.703
We've run all the diagnostics.

01:47.754 --> 01:50.089
The machine continues
to be unresponsive.

01:50.173 --> 01:51.707
Miss Sharp,
your guests are here.

01:53.293 --> 01:56.178
Expand the telemetry parameters
and run the tests again.

01:58.748 --> 01:59.715
I understand

01:59.766 --> 02:01.216
you broke the encryption
on the computer

02:01.268 --> 02:03.218
the other Olivia left behind.
A few days ago.

02:03.270 --> 02:05.104
Peter gave us a number
of password suggestions.

02:05.188 --> 02:06.188
One worked.

02:06.255 --> 02:07.640
Oh?
Yeah.

02:07.724 --> 02:09.591
It was a song lyric.

02:09.643 --> 02:12.444
And Fauxlivia ruined u2
for all of us.

02:12.529 --> 02:13.658
Fauxlivia?

02:13.778 --> 02:15.254
That's what Walter's
calling her now.

02:15.374 --> 02:17.533
"Fauxlivia"
as in "fake Olivia."

02:17.600 --> 02:19.952
Ah.
Uh, the data on the computer.

02:20.036 --> 02:21.120
What did you find?

02:21.204 --> 02:23.706
Unfortunately,
it's one big file,

02:23.773 --> 02:25.541
mission details buried
in hundreds of pages

02:25.608 --> 02:27.409
of mundane observations
about our world.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.328
We don't know what's valuable
and what isn't.

02:29.412 --> 02:31.330
And we can't identify
any type of code.

02:31.414 --> 02:33.415
Oh, my.

02:48.798 --> 02:50.232
It's bigger than I imagined.

02:50.299 --> 02:52.968
Well, I suppose...

02:53.019 --> 02:57.306
It's just big enough to destroy
a couple of universes.

02:59.475 --> 03:01.309
So far, we haven't
been able to figure out

03:01.361 --> 03:02.611
how the machine works.

03:02.662 --> 03:04.413
NASA, the CIA, the nih.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.865
We've had the government's
top people at our disposal.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.667
Which are you?
Excuse me?

03:08.735 --> 03:10.619
Which agency do you work for?

03:10.687 --> 03:12.287
Walter,
this is Dr. James Falcon,

03:12.339 --> 03:14.206
our lead scientist
on this project.

03:14.290 --> 03:17.993
Oh. Well, I suppose
that makes me your boss.

03:19.462 --> 03:21.930
I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.

03:21.998 --> 03:24.383
Sorry for the interruption.
Please continue.

03:24.467 --> 03:27.302
As I was saying,
we're confounded.

03:27.354 --> 03:28.804
There doesn't seem
to be an energy source

03:28.855 --> 03:30.856
and nothing that suggests
the machine

03:30.940 --> 03:33.442
can hold or transmit
any type of power.

03:41.284 --> 03:43.202
Jack,
are you getting this?

03:43.286 --> 03:45.154
Yeah.

03:45.205 --> 03:47.539
Some kind
of electromagnetic spike.

03:56.466 --> 03:58.533
Well, we think the problem
must be the missing piece.

03:58.585 --> 03:59.968
The one
that the other Olivia stole.

04:00.036 --> 04:01.470
That could be right.

04:01.537 --> 04:03.222
The piece was right
from the center of the machine.

04:03.306 --> 04:04.556
So it could be
the power source.

04:04.624 --> 04:06.425
Did the other Olivia
mention the machine

04:06.509 --> 04:07.593
in her files?

04:07.677 --> 04:09.261
We're still working
through the data.

04:31.251 --> 04:33.452
God.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.954
It's like...

04:36.022 --> 04:38.740
Something triggered it.

04:38.792 --> 04:40.058
Something did trigger it.

04:41.995 --> 04:44.513
Me.

05:53.361 --> 05:54.707
Peter.

05:55.409 --> 05:56.695
You've been out?

05:57.652 --> 06:00.887
No, I just came downstairs.
I couldn't sleep.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.245
I thought I heard the door.

06:03.312 --> 06:05.864
You must've been dreaming.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.649
I don't think so.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.985
I wasn't sleeping either.

06:09.105 --> 06:10.703
Is that peanut butter?
Can I have one?

06:10.770 --> 06:13.155
Mm-hmm.

06:14.412 --> 06:16.425
How you feeling?
Any more nosebleed?

06:16.492 --> 06:17.676
No.
Headaches?

06:17.761 --> 06:18.711
No.

06:18.778 --> 06:19.940
But you're unable to sleep?

06:20.060 --> 06:22.681
Yes, but I don't think
that has anything to do

06:22.766 --> 06:23.882
with the machine, Walter.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.835
Might.
We don't know yet.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.838
We don't know anything.

06:31.832 --> 06:33.889
The First Peoples book.

06:34.202 --> 06:37.843
I read it cover to cover
a dozen times.

06:37.963 --> 06:40.514
There's nothing to suggest
how that device works

06:40.634 --> 06:42.401
or how it's connected to you.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.870
Walter, stop, please.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.572
I want answers too.

06:48.113 --> 06:49.269
And I know you want to help me,

06:49.389 --> 06:51.510
but I don't think
that you can this time.

06:54.913 --> 06:57.249
You can't protect me
from everything.

07:13.378 --> 07:16.463
Only a couple more, Mr. Bishop.

07:16.547 --> 07:18.709
You still haven't convinced me
that this is necessary.

07:18.910 --> 07:20.177
Every human being
gives off a unique

07:20.244 --> 07:21.951
electromagnetic signature.

07:22.071 --> 07:23.685
We're testing to see
if it was indeed your son's

07:23.805 --> 07:24.452
that triggered the machine.

07:24.572 --> 07:26.817
I have a graduate degree
from mit as well.

07:26.901 --> 07:29.735
I don't need a test
to know how unlikely it is

07:29.804 --> 07:31.676
that this has got anything
to do with electromagnetics.

07:31.796 --> 07:32.522
Walter.
Peter.

07:34.430 --> 07:36.409
Do you have any idea
how much radiation

07:36.477 --> 07:37.944
you're about to be exposed to?

07:38.012 --> 07:40.597
Well, I do now, Walter.

07:40.665 --> 07:42.999
Walter, I think
you're overreacting.

07:43.084 --> 07:45.452
May I have a
word in private, please?

07:50.978 --> 07:52.471
We can't fire him, Walter.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.462
He's one of the most gifted
biomedical engineers

07:54.582 --> 07:55.479
in the country.

07:55.599 --> 07:56.947
I don't care who he is.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.382
I don't want him poking
and prodding my son.

07:59.502 --> 08:01.048
I know you're worried
about Peter.

08:01.168 --> 08:03.532
I'm not worried, Nina.
I'm terrified.

08:03.599 --> 08:05.530
Did you see the way
that machine reacted to him?

08:05.648 --> 08:07.649
That is precisely why
we're running these tests.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.585
This is a waste of time.

08:09.652 --> 08:11.587
It's not going
to tell us anything.

08:11.654 --> 08:13.755
Nina, I need you
to do something for me.

08:13.823 --> 08:17.926
I've been trying
to regenerate my brain cells.

08:17.994 --> 08:20.045
But William was too clever
for that.

08:20.129 --> 08:22.381
He not only took out pieces
of my brain,

08:22.465 --> 08:25.184
he inhibited their ability
to replicate.

08:25.268 --> 08:27.669
Walter... But Belly
kept detailed notes

08:27.720 --> 08:29.271
of everything he did.

08:29.338 --> 08:32.841
I want to see his research
to know how to reverse

08:32.892 --> 08:34.509
what he did to me.

08:34.561 --> 08:36.727
To regrow my brain cells.

08:36.813 --> 08:38.780
Walter, that's more
than 15 years ago.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.818
I'm not whole, Nina.

08:42.869 --> 08:45.120
If I'm to figure out

08:45.187 --> 08:47.372
how Peter is connected
to the machine,

08:47.457 --> 08:49.958
I have to get smarter.

08:53.195 --> 08:55.831
It's the only way
I'll be able to help my son.

08:58.167 --> 09:01.954
Yes. I'll get on it
right away.

09:03.423 --> 09:04.756
Thank you.

09:16.319 --> 09:17.319
Hey.

09:18.838 --> 09:19.771
Hey.

09:19.856 --> 09:21.240
You okay?

09:21.324 --> 09:24.576
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm great.

09:24.661 --> 09:26.662
In fact, I think I might use
my newfound superpowers

09:26.729 --> 09:27.913
to make this machine levitate.

09:27.981 --> 09:31.066
Oh, well, now that would
be impressive.

09:32.835 --> 09:34.620
I tried to call you last night
and you didn't pick up.

09:34.687 --> 09:38.257
Oh. Yeah.
Walter was being Walter.

09:38.324 --> 09:40.425
I had to go for a walk. (Dr.
Falcon) We're ready.

09:40.510 --> 09:42.044
Do you want something to help
you to sleep?

09:42.095 --> 09:43.095
This may take a while.

09:43.179 --> 09:44.529
No. I'm okay. Thanks.

09:44.597 --> 09:45.631
Peter, relax.

09:45.698 --> 09:48.050
This procedure's
perfectly safe.

09:48.117 --> 09:50.035
I'm sorry, doc.

09:50.103 --> 09:51.637
You'll forgive me
if I'm a little bit leery

09:51.721 --> 09:53.622
of machines right about now.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.274
I understand.

09:55.358 --> 09:57.192
Okay, well, I'm gonna
be right outside.

10:39.635 --> 10:42.521
I see Dr. Bishop leaves
the high intensity work for you.

10:42.605 --> 10:44.406
Agent Broyles.

10:44.473 --> 10:46.658
You know they're all over
at Massive Dynamic.

10:46.743 --> 10:49.277
I know.
I came to speak with you.

10:49.329 --> 10:52.197
For the past two days,

10:52.281 --> 10:53.915
an encryption team
has been waiting

10:53.983 --> 10:56.251
for the data on the other
Olivia's hard drive.

10:56.318 --> 10:58.153
Yeah.
I hear it's one big mess.

10:58.204 --> 11:00.105
More than 300 pages
of material.

11:00.173 --> 11:01.673
Details about this world.

11:01.758 --> 11:03.959
Profiles on our people.
Mission specifics.

11:04.010 --> 11:06.094
It's difficult to know
what information's important.

11:06.162 --> 11:07.713
Well, I'm happy to help.

11:07.797 --> 11:08.830
I knew you would be.

11:08.881 --> 11:10.816
And we certainly could use
your skills.

11:10.883 --> 11:12.718
But there's a reason
I haven't already asked.

11:16.022 --> 11:17.255
Her mission logs are filled

11:17.323 --> 11:19.107
with personal observations.

11:19.175 --> 11:21.560
And many of them concern
her relationship with Peter.

11:21.627 --> 11:23.729
And given what Peter and our
Olivia have been through...

11:23.813 --> 11:25.864
I understand.

11:25.948 --> 11:27.282
I'll be discreet.

11:29.652 --> 11:31.953
The file is on the mainframe.

11:34.040 --> 11:38.710
Broyles.
I'll be right there.

11:38.795 --> 11:39.745
Yes.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.296
I admit his rate is a bit high.

11:41.364 --> 11:45.634
130 beats per minute
is hardly a bit high.

11:45.701 --> 11:47.886
I want you to take him out
of that machine right now.

11:47.970 --> 11:50.055
Dr. Bishop,
it's a very narrow tachycardia.

11:50.139 --> 11:51.890
It's hardly
life-threatening.

11:51.974 --> 11:54.226
It would be ridiculous
to stop testing for this.

11:54.310 --> 11:55.927
Okay, so what is going on?

11:56.012 --> 11:57.679
Peter's heart rate
is a bit elevated.

11:57.747 --> 11:59.064
I assumed it was nerves
at first,

11:59.148 --> 12:00.982
but he should've
stabilized by now.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.067
Are you saying
that his heart rate

12:02.151 --> 12:03.268
could have triggered
the machine?

12:03.352 --> 12:04.936
No, I don't see
how it could have.

12:05.021 --> 12:08.356
But it is curious and implies
we should do more tests.

12:08.408 --> 12:09.691
By all means.

12:09.742 --> 12:12.661
Let's use my son as a new
Massive Dynamic lab rat!

12:12.728 --> 12:15.063
Walter, I don't think the doctor was...

12:18.534 --> 12:19.785
Dunham.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.870
I'm on my way.

12:21.921 --> 12:23.038
Okay. I've got to go.

12:23.089 --> 12:25.090
Can you call me if you learn
something new?

12:27.193 --> 12:28.910
His name was MichaelBaird.

12:28.961 --> 12:30.912
He was found dead
in the fountain by a colleague.

12:30.963 --> 12:33.081
M.E. Thinks he was murdered
some time around 3:00 A.M.

12:33.132 --> 12:35.684
So what's with the dead fish?

12:35.751 --> 12:36.885
He died
of Mercury poisoning.

12:36.936 --> 12:38.937
Mercury?

12:40.256 --> 12:42.357
He's a shapeshifter.

12:42.424 --> 12:44.226
That's not all.

12:44.277 --> 12:46.978
Turn him over, please.

12:47.063 --> 12:49.648
His data storage disk
was removed.

12:49.732 --> 12:51.149
Thank you.

12:51.234 --> 12:52.934
Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

12:54.704 --> 12:57.122
So why would someone kill
a shapeshifter?

12:57.190 --> 12:59.624
You mean someone other than us?

12:59.709 --> 13:02.244
Okay. What if this
was Walternate?

13:02.295 --> 13:04.045
What if he sent over
some type of cleaner

13:04.113 --> 13:05.497
to tie up all the loose ends?

13:05.565 --> 13:06.631
To kill this guy
before we...

13:06.716 --> 13:07.799
Before we learned what he knew.

13:07.884 --> 13:09.167
What are you thinking?

13:15.258 --> 13:16.224
This is Astrid.

13:16.292 --> 13:17.642
Agent Farnsworth,

13:17.727 --> 13:18.810
I need you to run a search

13:18.895 --> 13:20.312
on the other Olivia's
data file.

13:20.396 --> 13:22.130
Okay. What's the name?

13:22.181 --> 13:23.932
MichaelBaird.

13:29.138 --> 13:30.138
Yeah, he's on here.

13:30.189 --> 13:31.306
He's on a long list

13:31.357 --> 13:33.074
of port authority employees.

13:33.142 --> 13:34.743
Shut down the mainframe.
Shut it down now.

13:34.810 --> 13:36.444
And from this moment on,
no one accesses that file

13:36.496 --> 13:38.163
except you.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.533
What's going on?

13:41.617 --> 13:43.001
We cracked the encryption

13:43.085 --> 13:45.620
on the other Olivia's
hard drive 36 hours ago.

13:45.671 --> 13:48.340
Among the info,
she lists thousands of names.

13:48.424 --> 13:50.091
MichaelBaird is one of them.

13:50.159 --> 13:52.260
Suppose Walternate knew
we were getting close

13:52.328 --> 13:54.880
to identifying the list
of shapeshifters on that drive.

13:54.947 --> 13:56.181
How would he know that?

13:56.249 --> 13:59.017
Because someone on our side
may have told him.

14:00.603 --> 14:02.437
We got a mole.

14:12.843 --> 14:13.843
Well?

14:13.963 --> 14:16.419
I'd cut back on fried foods.

14:16.693 --> 14:19.515
But your lab work,
the e.E.G. Readings,

14:19.599 --> 14:21.100
it all looks pretty standard.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.652
Nothing to indicate
you and the machine

14:22.736 --> 14:23.911
share an electromagnetic
signature.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.688
And there's nothing
out of the ordinary?

14:25.756 --> 14:27.023
Well, like I told your father,

14:27.107 --> 14:28.958
your heart rate
was a bit elevated.

14:29.026 --> 14:31.661
But that could be adrenaline,
nerves, stress.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.996
Doctor, come on, when I got
within 50 feet of that machine,

14:34.081 --> 14:35.614
things started flying
around the room.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.666
My nose started bleeding.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.034
You're honestly trying
to tell me

14:38.118 --> 14:39.785
that that's just a coincidence?

14:39.836 --> 14:42.121
No. I'm telling you
we still have no idea

14:42.172 --> 14:43.339
how any of that happened,

14:43.423 --> 14:45.291
but from a medical standpoint,

14:45.342 --> 14:46.676
you seem perfectly normal.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.827
I'm willing to run more tests.

14:48.879 --> 14:50.662
But, frankly,
I thought you'd be relieved.

14:55.018 --> 14:57.603
Well, hey, you're the doctor.

15:05.845 --> 15:07.679
Peter.

15:07.731 --> 15:08.814
Agent Dunham called.

15:08.865 --> 15:11.150
They found a dead shapeshifter.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.985
She thinks someone
on the inside

15:13.053 --> 15:15.287
must be feeding Walternate
information.

15:17.407 --> 15:18.574
Let's go.

15:21.411 --> 15:22.378
Thank you.

15:22.462 --> 15:23.963
You're welcome.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.368
We assume the
shapeshifter was killed

15:29.419 --> 15:30.669
because someone knew
it was just a matter of f time

15:30.721 --> 15:32.371
before we ID'd him.

15:32.422 --> 15:34.056
We need to round up anybody
who had access

15:34.141 --> 15:36.058
to the other Olivia's hard drive.
 We're already on it.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.393
All the FBI decryption teams.

15:37.477 --> 15:38.877
Anybody in Massive Dynamic.

15:38.929 --> 15:40.529
Okay, Peter. Trust me,
we're on top of it.

15:40.597 --> 15:42.932
We're questioning every one
of them as we speak.

15:43.016 --> 15:44.517
In fact, that's what Walter
and Nina are doing

15:44.568 --> 15:45.518
at Massive Dynamic now.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.552
What about the rest
of her file?

15:46.603 --> 15:47.903
Does it mention
any other shapeshifters

15:47.988 --> 15:48.904
other thanBaird?

15:48.989 --> 15:50.106
Well, Newton's mentioned.

15:50.190 --> 15:51.190
And if there are two of them,

15:51.241 --> 15:52.691
we're assuming there are more.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.111
But there are hundreds of names
throughout the file.

15:55.195 --> 15:57.913
Just lists of government
employees, local cops.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.865
We're running profiles
on all of them now.

15:59.916 --> 16:01.584
We're looking for anything
that might indicate

16:01.668 --> 16:02.918
a recent change in behavior.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.787
Anything which would suggest
having been replaced

16:04.871 --> 16:05.921
by a shapeshifter.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.790
All right, well,
it looks like a big job.

16:07.858 --> 16:09.592
So how can we help you
sift through the data?

16:09.676 --> 16:12.094
Um, it's probably not
a good idea.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.629
Why not?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.218
Because she wrote about me.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.353
Yeah.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.609
Some parts of this read
like a diary.

16:26.676 --> 16:28.527
You're quite prominent.

16:32.566 --> 16:34.283
We should get
to Massive Dynamic.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.287
Okay, well, call me
if you find something.

16:43.710 --> 16:45.628
State your full name, please.

16:45.712 --> 16:48.464
Special agent
Matthew Nicholas Goldin.

16:48.548 --> 16:50.800
Does the name "Michael Baird"
mean anything to you?

16:50.867 --> 16:52.802
No, it does not.

16:52.869 --> 16:54.170
Where were you born?

16:54.237 --> 16:55.971
Brooklyn, New York.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.756
How many more are there?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.392
22 of our people.
Another 7 from the FBI.

17:00.460 --> 17:03.112
So far, all the blood tests
have come back negative.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.097
But that doesn't rule out
the possibility

17:05.147 --> 17:06.147
of a human mole.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.750
Lie detectors are unreliable.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.685
He's right.
People beat them all the time.

17:09.769 --> 17:10.969
Not this one.

17:11.021 --> 17:12.538
William designed it.

17:12.606 --> 17:13.989
It measures the slightest shift

17:14.057 --> 17:15.241
in facial muscles,

17:15.308 --> 17:17.393
which allows us a link
to stress

17:17.461 --> 17:19.978
and a particular emotion.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.981
His facial muscles
tell us that his stress

17:22.048 --> 17:23.147
is not connected

17:23.200 --> 17:24.666
to feelings of guilt or shame.

17:24.751 --> 17:26.335
Very clever.

17:26.419 --> 17:28.621
I wish I'd thought of it.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.821
We need to keep everybody
in custody

17:29.873 --> 17:30.806
until we find the leak.

17:30.874 --> 17:32.091
There are nearly 30 people

17:32.158 --> 17:33.175
on the list.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.426
I'm not sure that's practical.

17:34.494 --> 17:36.345
Do you actually want to catch
this mole, Nina?

17:36.413 --> 17:39.815
Do you know the
identity of any shapeshifter?

17:39.883 --> 17:41.383
No, I don't.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.635
Do you know anything

17:42.686 --> 17:43.669
about the murder...

17:43.720 --> 17:45.271
Walter, do you have a moment?

17:45.338 --> 17:47.806
Yes. Yes, of course.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.642
Have you ever
given anyone information

17:49.693 --> 17:52.027
to assist in the murder
of a shapeshifter?

17:52.112 --> 17:55.681
No, I haven't.

17:55.732 --> 17:58.284
You were right.

17:58.351 --> 17:59.835
I found William's research.

17:59.903 --> 18:02.238
His notes suggest
that he designed

18:02.305 --> 18:04.640
a retroviral serum
based on your DNA

18:04.708 --> 18:07.409
that will regrow
your brain tissue.

18:07.494 --> 18:09.545
That's wonderful.

18:09.629 --> 18:12.197
Oh, thank you, Belly.
Walter,

18:12.249 --> 18:14.466
William experimented
with lab animals first.

18:14.534 --> 18:16.201
A rat and a chimpanzee.

18:16.253 --> 18:19.004
Now, back in the '90s,
we had a small lab fire.

18:19.055 --> 18:20.589
The original labels
were destroyed.

18:20.674 --> 18:21.640
I'm going to ask the lab

18:21.708 --> 18:23.309
to run diagnostics
on all three.

18:23.376 --> 18:25.227
Then they should be able
to tell us which one

18:25.312 --> 18:26.395
was made for you.

18:26.479 --> 18:28.564
Walter.

18:28.648 --> 18:30.516
Don't worry.
I've snorted worse.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.050
A few good whiffs

18:32.102 --> 18:35.053
and my brain should be able
to begin to regrow

18:35.105 --> 18:36.488
its missing parts.

18:36.556 --> 18:39.074
And what if the serum
is not based on your DNA?

18:39.159 --> 18:42.545
Well, I'll probably get a rash.

18:42.612 --> 18:44.196
Well, I'm afraid
we've got a bigger problem

18:44.247 --> 18:45.264
on our hands.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.415
I'm worried about Peter.

18:46.499 --> 18:49.368
So am I. But that's what this
is all about.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.586
Peter has endured
a lot recently.

18:50.670 --> 18:51.921
Maybe he should talk
with someone.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.207
No, what I'm trying to say
is there are people

18:55.258 --> 18:56.458
that are trained to help.

18:58.678 --> 19:01.463
Nina, he's my son.

19:01.531 --> 19:04.833
I'm the one that needs
to help him.

19:04.901 --> 19:07.286
Do you know anything

19:07.354 --> 19:09.104
about the murder
of MichaelBaird?

19:09.172 --> 19:10.606
No.

19:10.690 --> 19:11.924
How long have
you been in the FBI?

19:11.992 --> 19:13.258
About five years.

19:13.310 --> 19:15.110
Peter.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.228
And you never
heard of MichaelBaird

19:16.279 --> 19:17.863
before I brought
his name up...

19:17.930 --> 19:19.765
About the other Olivia's files,

19:19.816 --> 19:21.900
I know that you slept with her

19:21.952 --> 19:24.436
and I know that you're trying
to protect me.

19:24.487 --> 19:26.455
But reading about it
isn't going to make it worse.

19:26.539 --> 19:28.106
Peter, I'm not doing
any good here.

19:28.158 --> 19:30.626
But if I could help Astrid
with the files...

19:30.710 --> 19:34.246
Olivia.

19:34.297 --> 19:35.714
I've conned people.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.219
And I know what I would've
written about them.

19:43.139 --> 19:45.140
She must've thought
that I was a fool.

19:50.313 --> 19:53.082
And I don't want you
to see me like that.

19:55.251 --> 19:59.471
All right, we're done.

20:07.364 --> 20:09.481
That's it.
We've talked to everybody.

20:09.532 --> 20:11.867
We should call Broyles
and tell him.

20:11.951 --> 20:13.185
What about Dr. Falcon?

20:13.253 --> 20:15.254
Dr. Falcon
wasn't on the team

20:15.321 --> 20:16.505
that worked on the hard drive.

20:16.573 --> 20:18.173
Maybe not, but he was
asking questions about it

20:18.258 --> 20:19.541
yesterday at the hangar.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.500
Hey, it's me.

20:28.551 --> 20:31.887
Uh, could you send
Dr. Falcon up, please?

20:32.889 --> 20:34.223
Why not?

20:37.727 --> 20:39.478
What?

20:39.529 --> 20:41.196
Dr. Falcon left work early.

20:53.209 --> 20:54.526
Clear.

21:11.419 --> 21:13.387
The exact
same as MichaelBaird.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.055
Two shots in the head
and his data storage unit

21:15.106 --> 21:16.139
had been removed.

21:16.224 --> 21:19.046
You're right.
Dr. James Falcon.

21:19.142 --> 21:19.913
He's on here.

21:20.033 --> 21:21.728
He's part of a list
of Massive Dynamic employees.

21:21.779 --> 21:23.980
Dr. Falcon's name
is on her computer.

21:24.065 --> 21:26.533
So if Walternate's knocking
these guys off,

21:26.600 --> 21:28.035
they must know something
important.

21:28.102 --> 21:30.987
Damn. Yeah.
Tell Walter I feel the same.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.839
That's not
about the shapeshifters.

21:32.907 --> 21:34.825
Walter's giving himself
an iq test.

21:34.909 --> 21:38.412
Okay. Well, Falcon's body
is being taken to the lab.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.080
So when Walter finishes
exercising his mind,

21:40.131 --> 21:41.298
can you get him
to take a look?

21:41.382 --> 21:42.466
Maybe he can find something

21:42.550 --> 21:44.167
that will help us identify
the killer.

21:44.252 --> 21:45.469
Of course.

21:45.553 --> 21:48.455
Astrid's still going through
her files.

21:48.506 --> 21:51.791
But so far no luck identifying
the remaining shapeshifters.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.293
Yeah. The techs are drawing
a blank too.

21:53.344 --> 21:54.978
I don't think we're gonna find
anything in here

21:55.063 --> 21:56.763
that's gonna tell us
who Falcon was working with.

21:56.814 --> 21:58.765
God, it feels like every time
we learn something new,

21:58.816 --> 22:00.650
we're still a step behind.

22:00.735 --> 22:02.736
If we could get to one
of these shapeshifters,

22:02.803 --> 22:05.655
maybe we could finally
get answers.

22:09.577 --> 22:11.361
My bone saw, dear.

22:11.446 --> 22:13.980
The aspirator, voltmeter,
and a ripe banana.

22:14.031 --> 22:15.999
Please tell me
the banana's for you.

22:16.084 --> 22:19.369
I had a sudden craving.

22:19.454 --> 22:20.921
It's odd though.

22:20.988 --> 22:23.823
Bananas are typically
my least favorite fruit.

22:25.793 --> 22:27.511
Oh, news.

22:32.300 --> 22:33.500
Yeah, but it's not good.

22:33.551 --> 22:35.352
Another 20 names
have been cross-checked

22:35.436 --> 22:36.803
from Fauxlivia's files.

22:36.854 --> 22:39.806
None of them are shapeshifters.

22:42.443 --> 22:45.979
So you've read
all of Olivia's files?

22:46.030 --> 22:47.531
Yeah. Most of them.

22:47.615 --> 22:50.183
What did she have to say
about me?

22:55.239 --> 22:57.240
She liked you.

22:57.325 --> 23:01.912
She thought that you were kind
and brilliant.

23:05.199 --> 23:09.085
Would you help me
with him, please, dear?

23:17.562 --> 23:19.095
Walter.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.432
Oh. I'm sorry.
That was very rude.

23:24.885 --> 23:27.103
I was displaying dominance.
'Scuse me?

23:27.188 --> 23:29.272
The serum I took.

23:29.357 --> 23:31.358
It must've been meant
for a chimpanzee.

23:31.425 --> 23:34.244
You mean it's growing
chimp DNA in your brain?

23:34.328 --> 23:36.746
Well, just a bit.

23:36.831 --> 23:38.565
It's fascinating though,
isn't it?

23:38.616 --> 23:41.101
How the tiniest change
in our composition

23:41.169 --> 23:45.121
can yield such drastic changes
in our behavior.

23:45.189 --> 23:47.457
It's not surprising, really.

23:47.542 --> 23:51.094
After all, we share
50% of our DNA with a banana.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.630
You sure it isn't dangerous?

23:53.714 --> 23:58.385
No. It'll pass.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.303
My immune system

24:00.388 --> 24:03.089
will recognize it as foreign

24:03.140 --> 24:06.393
and reject it.

24:06.444 --> 24:07.427
So...

24:07.478 --> 24:09.429
The bone saw, please.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.597
Hmm.

24:10.648 --> 24:11.764
What is it?

24:11.816 --> 24:14.484
I'm not sure.
Magnify...

24:21.776 --> 24:23.326
Looks like blood.

24:23.411 --> 24:25.629
So this must've been
how he got in.

24:25.713 --> 24:28.615
It looks like he used a knife
to Jimmy open the window.

24:28.666 --> 24:31.501
Which would suggest
that he and Dr. Falcon

24:31.586 --> 24:33.169
were strangers
or otherwise he would've used

24:33.254 --> 24:34.504
the front door, right?

24:34.589 --> 24:36.172
Hmm.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.061
Peter.

24:45.399 --> 24:46.933
I owe you an apology.

24:46.984 --> 24:48.801
For what?

24:51.322 --> 24:52.856
The last few weeks
have been really hard for me.

24:52.940 --> 24:54.858
I've been so focused
on what the other Olivia

24:54.942 --> 24:56.526
did to me
that I just haven't thought

24:56.611 --> 24:58.194
about what she did to you.

25:00.331 --> 25:01.481
Look, Olivia...

25:01.532 --> 25:02.999
And I want you to know
that I'm sorry

25:03.084 --> 25:05.818
and that I get it now.

25:05.870 --> 25:07.621
That good news is
is that she's gone.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.006
I know it doesn't feel
like that at the moment,

25:10.091 --> 25:13.176
but she is gone.

25:13.261 --> 25:16.996
And, um, we can get past it.

25:23.170 --> 25:24.337
Thank you.

25:32.530 --> 25:35.031
I got to do more tests
at Massive Dynamic.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.032
Do you want me to drive you?

25:36.117 --> 25:37.200
No. I'll just take
the train.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.702
But could you call Walter
and let him know

25:38.786 --> 25:41.187
I'll be home late
and not to worry?

25:41.238 --> 25:43.022
Mm-hmm.

25:44.959 --> 25:47.827
Thank you.

25:49.863 --> 25:51.531
Dunham.

25:51.582 --> 25:52.799
It's me.

25:52.867 --> 25:55.585
We just found blood
under Dr. Falcon's fingernails.

25:55.653 --> 25:57.087
So the killer is human?

25:57.171 --> 26:00.540
Appears so.
Type "A" positive.

26:00.591 --> 26:02.392
It's fairly common.

26:02.460 --> 26:05.562
I'm "A" positive along with
1/3 of the population.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.548
I'm searching Massive Dynamics'
personnel files now

26:08.599 --> 26:10.517
and there is only one person
with that blood type

26:10.568 --> 26:12.102
who had access
to Fauxlivia's files.

26:12.186 --> 26:16.990
Brandon Fayette.
Nina Sharp's chief scientist.

26:33.958 --> 26:35.041
Spare some change, lady?

26:36.260 --> 26:40.680
Yeah. Sure.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.857
Don't move.

27:43.027 --> 27:45.111
Can I swallow?

27:57.508 --> 27:58.658
Hey, Bermudez.

28:14.909 --> 28:16.559
Have you ever killed
a shapeshifter?

28:16.627 --> 28:18.128
No.

28:18.212 --> 28:20.148
I've been going
to the gym though.

28:20.268 --> 28:22.298
I'm kind of stoked you'd think
I'd have that kind of strength.

28:22.383 --> 28:24.050
You can keep
asking me questions.

28:24.118 --> 28:25.335
The machine
isn't gonna give you

28:25.419 --> 28:27.170
a different answer
because I didn't do it.

28:27.238 --> 28:29.172
He's right.

28:29.256 --> 28:32.709
Machine says
he's telling the truth.

28:34.128 --> 28:38.014
Hi. What have you got?

28:38.099 --> 28:39.349
It's not Brandon.

28:39.433 --> 28:41.467
We questioned him
and he passed the polygraph.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.802
Well, that's not unheard of.

28:42.853 --> 28:44.688
Lots of people defy
a polygraph.

28:44.772 --> 28:45.989
Not this one.

28:46.073 --> 28:47.774
Okay, which one of these
haven't you gone through?

28:54.949 --> 28:57.584
I understand why nobody
wants me to read these files.

28:57.651 --> 28:59.753
But what's written here
is in the past

28:59.820 --> 29:02.122
and what is important
is the future.

29:02.173 --> 29:03.590
Somewhere in here are the names

29:03.657 --> 29:04.841
of the remaining shapeshifters.

29:04.925 --> 29:06.376
And we're running out
of options.

29:06.460 --> 29:08.962
Yes. And we have
to find them

29:09.013 --> 29:10.346
before whoever's
killing them does.

29:10.431 --> 29:11.598
Believe me.
I know.

29:11.665 --> 29:12.932
Broyles is calling me
every 20 minutes

29:13.000 --> 29:14.184
to tell me
the same thing.

29:14.268 --> 29:15.835
At this point,
it's not just the shapeshifters

29:15.886 --> 29:16.836
that I'm worried about.

29:16.887 --> 29:18.171
I mean, if we can find
the next target

29:18.222 --> 29:19.222
and surveil him,

29:19.306 --> 29:20.607
maybe we can catch this guy.

29:20.674 --> 29:23.226
Look, I am really thankful
for your help. Seriously.

29:23.310 --> 29:24.978
But I've been through
this whole stack already.

29:25.029 --> 29:27.030
But I'm not just
another set of eyes.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.365
We're the same.

29:29.433 --> 29:31.201
The other Olivia and me.

29:31.285 --> 29:33.036
I should be able to think
the same way.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.405
So maybe I'm gonna be able
to find a pattern.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.101
Hello?

30:05.186 --> 30:06.853
Walter, it's Nina.

30:06.904 --> 30:12.058
Nina. I was just thinking
about you.

30:12.109 --> 30:15.278
The first sample
is definitely chimpanzee.

30:15.346 --> 30:16.896
You can label it now.

30:16.964 --> 30:18.198
First sample?

30:18.265 --> 30:20.784
Belly's serum.
I'm ready for round two.

30:20.851 --> 30:22.519
Actually, I was calling
for Peter.

30:22.586 --> 30:24.921
He's not with you?

30:25.005 --> 30:26.673
Has he finished
the tests already?

30:26.740 --> 30:29.075
Finished?
No, no, that's why I'm calling.

30:29.126 --> 30:31.127
I wanted to schedule
a round of tests.

30:31.195 --> 30:33.029
But Olivia said...

30:36.517 --> 30:38.101
I must've misunderstood.

30:38.185 --> 30:40.787
Walter, I understand how you
feel about this testing.

30:40.855 --> 30:42.222
And I know that Peter
is reticent

30:42.289 --> 30:43.422
as well.

30:43.474 --> 30:45.041
But I also know
that you understand

30:45.109 --> 30:47.227
why these tests
are so important.

30:47.294 --> 30:49.112
Will you tell him I called?

30:49.180 --> 30:53.183
Yes. I'll give him
the message.

32:11.395 --> 32:12.812
You okay?

32:17.868 --> 32:19.652
"It's strange,

32:19.703 --> 32:21.905
"but at moments
when I'm with PB,

32:21.989 --> 32:24.540
"I find myself forgetting
what I'm here for.

32:24.625 --> 32:30.213
"PB's different
than I expected him to be.

32:30.297 --> 32:33.499
"A sincerity behind his eyes.

32:33.550 --> 32:36.702
"A deep-seated goodness.

32:36.754 --> 32:40.423
"It's hard not to get caught up
in it.

32:40.507 --> 32:43.259
Not to get caught up
in him."

32:47.898 --> 32:49.098
You know,
this may have started out

32:49.183 --> 32:50.149
as a mission,

32:50.217 --> 32:52.485
but it turned
into something else.

32:52.552 --> 32:54.520
She was starting to have
real feelings for him.

32:54.571 --> 32:56.272
Olivia...
No, I mean,

32:56.357 --> 32:57.273
and he's a great guy.

32:57.358 --> 32:59.492
And, of course, we're the same.

32:59.559 --> 33:01.394
She would see what I see.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.831
We speak the same.

33:04.898 --> 33:07.283
We use the same phrases.

33:07.351 --> 33:09.986
I'm reading this
and I'm thinking

33:10.054 --> 33:13.122
"This is how I make sense
of things.

33:13.207 --> 33:16.876
Make sense of feelings.
Of Peter."

33:16.927 --> 33:18.645
We even use the...

33:18.712 --> 33:20.013
Olivia?

33:23.017 --> 33:26.636
Okay.
I think I got something.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.056
You need the original printout
of the file.

33:30.107 --> 33:32.358
Exactly what am I looking for?

33:32.426 --> 33:34.277
When I was a little kid,
my mother used to call me olive

33:34.361 --> 33:35.561
and hers did too.

33:35.612 --> 33:37.613
So I think this is a letter
substitution code.

33:37.698 --> 33:39.115
So o-l-I-v-e.

33:39.199 --> 33:42.452
Uh, "O" is the 15th
letter of the alphabet.

33:42.536 --> 33:45.822
So on the 15th page,
the 15th name is...

33:45.889 --> 33:48.558
It's Newton.

33:50.210 --> 33:52.295
"L" is the 12th letter
of the alphabet.

33:52.379 --> 33:53.796
12th name on the 12th page.

33:55.499 --> 33:56.632
MichaelBaird.

33:56.717 --> 33:59.135
And "I" is the 9th letter
in the alphabet.

33:59.219 --> 34:01.671
The 9th name on the 9th page.

34:01.755 --> 34:03.222
James Falcon.

34:03.290 --> 34:05.975
The 22nd name on the 22nd page

34:06.060 --> 34:08.393
is Jackie Bermudez.

34:08.462 --> 34:10.563
And the last one
is Zach Alpert.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.565
Okay, we got them.

35:02.516 --> 35:06.402
Hello, my friend.
I was expecting you.

35:12.276 --> 35:15.236
Where you getting
your information?

35:16.898 --> 35:18.815
How did you find me?

35:23.321 --> 35:25.322
I know who you are, Peter.

35:25.406 --> 35:26.957
You might think

35:27.041 --> 35:30.827
that we're not allowed
to kill you.

35:30.912 --> 35:33.613
But that doesn't mean
that we can't hurt you.

35:35.583 --> 35:38.635
We can get everything
we need from you

35:38.703 --> 35:41.888
even if you only have
nine fingers...

35:41.956 --> 35:45.459
Or one eye.

35:46.460 --> 35:47.460
Peter.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.700
Broyles.

36:10.785 --> 36:12.702
Jackie Bermudez's
apartment was empty.

36:12.787 --> 36:14.671
We got a team sitting on it
in case she comes back.

36:16.457 --> 36:17.374
Damn it.

36:19.961 --> 36:21.044
You okay?

36:21.129 --> 36:22.512
Yeah.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.631
So five shapeshifters.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.799
How'd you break the code?

36:25.850 --> 36:27.350
There's only five letters
in "olive."

36:27.435 --> 36:29.553
Newton,Baird,
Falcon are dead.

36:29.637 --> 36:30.971
Bermudez is missing.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.672
So that leaves one.

36:37.178 --> 36:38.895
How'd you find me, Walter?

36:38.980 --> 36:40.313
I found your notes.
Fauxlivia's file.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.315
You left... They were right
on your desk.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.568
I'm smart enough to open
a phone book.

36:47.305 --> 36:48.889
I looked the man up.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.410
You killed them all,
didn't you, Peter?

36:57.331 --> 37:01.384
And it's been useless.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.385
I didn't learn anything

37:02.470 --> 37:04.004
from the rest
of the data disks.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.323
But he's the last one.
He must know something.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.141
Peter...

37:08.209 --> 37:11.044
I have to know
what they know, Walter.

37:11.095 --> 37:12.762
I'm tired of being reactive.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.450
Son, this isn't you.
You can't just...

37:17.518 --> 37:20.854
They're soldiers, Walter.
They're here to kill us.

37:26.727 --> 37:30.030
Besides,
they're not even human.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.565
And I'm not doing
anything wrong.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.047
Then why didn't you tell us?

37:50.601 --> 37:52.152
If you weren't doing
anything wrong,

37:52.220 --> 37:54.087
why didn't you tell us?

37:58.893 --> 38:03.446
I don't know what's happened,
but this is not you.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.662
Hello.
Peter, it's me.

38:18.746 --> 38:20.947
Good news. We identified
the last two shapeshifters.

38:20.998 --> 38:24.084
We're heading to Zach Alpert's
apartment.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.235
It's in revere.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.287
I'll let you know
if we find him.

39:03.858 --> 39:07.043
We failed. He got all of them
and now he's gone.

39:07.128 --> 39:12.332
We don't know who he was.
We're always just a step behind.

39:12.383 --> 39:15.168
Well, we still have
the other Olivia's computer.

39:15.219 --> 39:18.455
Maybe Astrid
can learn something.

39:23.394 --> 39:26.696
Okay. I should get home.
Bye, Walter.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.514
Bye.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.209
Peter, I read her file.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.396
And you should know
that you have nothing

39:43.464 --> 39:44.798
to be embarrassed about.

39:49.136 --> 39:50.570
Thank you.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.480
I think I know
what's happening to you.

40:04.318 --> 40:08.071
Every relationship
is reciprocal, Peter.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.875
When you touch something,
it touches you.

40:11.942 --> 40:13.443
You're changing, son.

40:13.527 --> 40:17.614
When you touched the machine,
it changed you.

40:17.698 --> 40:22.335
It weaponized you.

40:22.403 --> 40:23.837
So what do we do now, Walter?

40:23.904 --> 40:26.289
I don't know.

40:36.634 --> 40:39.135
I understand you
have news on the device.

40:39.203 --> 40:40.937
Not exactly,
but we found these three copies

40:41.021 --> 40:42.639
of the First Peoples book.

40:42.723 --> 40:43.923
Where did we find them?

40:43.974 --> 40:44.974
One was in a museum.

40:45.059 --> 40:46.592
The others,
private collections.

40:46.644 --> 40:47.977
The owners did not want
to part with them.

40:48.062 --> 40:51.597
But it kind of helps
when you have unlimited funds.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.316
And they all say
the same thing?

40:53.401 --> 40:55.702
It's in three different
languages

40:55.769 --> 40:57.103
written by three different
authors.

40:57.154 --> 40:59.939
They're all published
within two years of each other.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.108
So forgiving
for the translations,

41:02.159 --> 41:04.911
they're almost literally
word for word.

41:04.979 --> 41:07.914
And what do you make of it?

41:07.965 --> 41:10.049
A civilization
that existed millions of years

41:10.117 --> 41:11.251
before the dinosaurs?

41:11.302 --> 41:15.371
The planet has been spinning
for five billion years.

41:15.439 --> 41:18.892
We've only been around
for the past 250,000.

41:18.959 --> 41:22.011
There were six
major extinction events

41:22.096 --> 41:24.147
before we even crawled out
of the slime.

41:24.231 --> 41:25.682
So who's to say
that one of them

41:25.766 --> 41:28.184
didn't wipe out
a great civilization?

41:28.269 --> 41:29.903
Hmm.

41:32.072 --> 41:33.239
There's another thing.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.693
When we put the word out
that we were looking

41:36.777 --> 41:37.911
for copies of the book,

41:37.978 --> 41:39.896
we found out we weren't
the only ones.

41:41.648 --> 41:42.815
A few years ago,

41:42.867 --> 41:45.168
somebody started
a similar search.

41:45.252 --> 41:46.169
Who?

41:46.253 --> 41:48.488
William Bell.

41:50.657 --> 41:53.009
Ah.
