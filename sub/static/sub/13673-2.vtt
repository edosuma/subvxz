WEBVTT

00:09.051 --> 00:11.258
J‘ Now I got the spirit

00:11.387 --> 00:13.469
J‘ And you got it too

00:13.598 --> 00:16.931
J‘ Always watchin' over me and you

00:17.059 --> 00:19.766
J‘ Just call your name, yeah

00:19.896 --> 00:24.185
J‘ Will set your soul aflame, oh yes, it will

00:24.317 --> 00:27.901
J‘ Then you burn with the fire of love

00:28.029 --> 00:30.065
J‘ You're gonna burn

00:30.198 --> 00:31.813
J‘ Till you light above

00:31.949 --> 00:34.611
J‘ And you feel brand—new, oh yeah

00:34.744 --> 00:37.281
J‘ When the spirit come to carry you

00:37.413 --> 00:38.949
J‘ I can see you now

00:39.081 --> 00:41.117
J‘ Well, you're walking with the spirit

00:41.250 --> 00:43.161
J‘ By your side

00:43.294 --> 00:47.003
J‘ Talking, oh, as your guide

00:47.131 --> 00:50.123
J‘ See your light shine up above

00:50.259 --> 00:52.341
J‘ You've been walking with the spirit

00:52.470 --> 00:54.381
J‘ Of love now J‘

01:01.604 --> 01:04.812
All right! Awesome, man.
That was just awesome.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.147
Yeah, you're right.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.140
The legendary Coco Robicheaux,

01:08.277 --> 01:11.485
live in the studio
on this beautiful December morning

01:11.614 --> 01:17.610
here at the reconstituted, rededicated, relocated WWOZ

01:17.745 --> 01:20.862
in the completely soulless
faux French Market,

01:20.998 --> 01:23.705
a shameful shell and shadow
of its former self.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.543
What's up with that, bro? Are they gonna
let OZ go back to Armstrong Park?

01:27.672 --> 01:30.755
I don't think so, bro.
I don't see it. Not in the cards.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.966
You don't get
the good ancestor vibe up here.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.585
All tourists and T—shirts.

01:35.721 --> 01:39.134
Hey, you're preaching to the choir, man.
You're preaching to the choir.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.679
So, um, what are you doing there?

01:42.812 --> 01:45.269
Tell the folks at home, Coco,
a little play by play.

01:45.398 --> 01:50.188
Well, if OZ can't go back to Congo Square,

01:50.319 --> 01:52.526
we're gonna bring Congo Square to OZ.

01:52.655 --> 01:55.271
Bringing the mountain
to Mohammed sort of thing.

01:55.408 --> 01:57.649
By lighting these spirit candles...

01:58.661 --> 02:03.701
we're gonna summon Erzulie Dantor to us.

02:03.833 --> 02:08.167
Cool. Coco Robicheaux
runs the voodoo down live.

02:08.296 --> 02:11.959
Uh, Coco, this Azalea chick
who's gonna drop by...

02:12.091 --> 02:14.332
— Erzulie Dantor.
— Uh—huh.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.959
— The loa of New Orleans.
- The Ioa.

02:17.096 --> 02:19.553
Yes, indeed, a loa, just what we need.

02:19.682 --> 02:22.424
The black Madonna,
the beautiful mulattress

02:22.560 --> 02:24.892
whose earthly incarnation
was Marie Laveau.

02:25.021 --> 02:26.807
The voodoo queen of New Orleans. Cool.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.976
And, uh, the loa of lesbians everywhere.

02:30.109 --> 02:32.566
Lesbians. Very cool.

02:32.695 --> 02:34.731
Uh, Coco,

02:34.864 --> 02:36.650
didn't you burn your apartment down

02:36.782 --> 02:38.113
some years ago...

02:38.242 --> 02:39.857
candles,

02:39.994 --> 02:41.450
Cafe Brasil?

02:41.579 --> 02:44.696
— Hopefully that ain't gonna happen here.
— Yeah.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.117
- (Squawking)
— Whoa! Oh my God! What?

02:49.253 --> 02:51.414
It's a chicken...a chicken. It's a live chicken.

02:51.547 --> 02:55.039
Ladies and gentlemen,
a live chicken in the studio.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.633
The loa needs proof of our devotion.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.423
Yeah, what woman doesn't?

02:59.555 --> 03:01.637
Ah, Barbancourt.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.757
(Laughs)

03:06.645 --> 03:09.261
OK, that would be...
that would be a knife.

03:09.398 --> 03:14.392
It's a big one. Are we...entering
some sacrificial realm here?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.610
Why don't you play the next cut on that CD

03:16.739 --> 03:18.695
as l summon the spirits?

03:19.575 --> 03:21.566
OK.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.126
(J‘ Radio playing music)

05:03.262 --> 05:05.753
(Woman) Me trying to scramble
my breakfast on a hot plate.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.551
Life on the frontier. Excuse me.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.015
Hang on, hang on.
Let me turn down the radio.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.057
Oh, who knows?

05:14.190 --> 05:16.806
Entergy says there's still water in the lines.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.319
God, Julie, you're a life—saver.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.436
Fantastic.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.946
- Thanks.
— (Sizzling)

05:25.075 --> 05:28.283
Shit. Shit.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.532
Shit.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.379
(Sighs)

05:53.395 --> 05:54.851
(Sobs)

05:58.692 --> 06:00.648
(J‘ Radio playing music)

06:08.327 --> 06:10.363
(Music stops)

06:13.832 --> 06:16.164
(Power saw buzzing)

06:18.128 --> 06:20.835
(Hammering)

06:33.811 --> 06:36.723
Mom is sure,
but Sheriff says he never had him.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.187
Sheriff said nothing
went wrong at OPP too.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.103
Most of the OPP prisoners
went to Hunt up in St. Gabriel.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.774
Yeah, and after Hunt, DOC
dispersed them. I know that.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.612
All over the great state of Louisiana.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.527
But how can I find him, Andi?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.992
That's what I'm asking. Which parish?

06:52.121 --> 06:55.363
Well, it's not like the state
exactly kept track of who went where.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.660
Didn't even really know who is who.

06:57.793 --> 07:02.036
The prisoners had wristbands,
but they took 'em off, stole 'em.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.333
And all the records undenNater...

07:04.466 --> 07:07.253
So we've been going
parish to parish filing motions

07:07.386 --> 07:09.672
compelling the local sheriffs
to provide us with a list

07:09.805 --> 07:12.012
of all the names of OPP prisoners
in their custody.

07:12.141 --> 07:14.928
So if Daymo got picked up
just before the storm...

07:15.060 --> 07:16.675
— Something minor?
— Mm—hm.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.019
— He's doing Katrina time in East Jesus.
— Mm—hm.

07:19.148 --> 07:22.732
Most likely he'll be released
for time served once you find him.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.646
Family hasn't heard from him?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.691
— Still at the same number?
— His mom is.

07:28.824 --> 07:32.442
We found inmates incarcerated for months not given a
phone call.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.739
That's disturbing.

07:36.332 --> 07:37.993
(Sighs)

07:38.125 --> 07:40.036
(LaDonna) Mm—mm. Mm—mm.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.876
I'll start on it this week,
Miss LaDonna, guarantee.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.870
I've been hearing that song.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.963
You know what else I've been hearing?

07:47.092 --> 07:51.131
That goddamn blue plastic tarp flapping around my roof. I
hear it in my sleep.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.879
When are you gonna get started for real?

07:54.016 --> 07:55.927
I need more money for shingles.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.346
Mister, I already gave you
money for shingles.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.562
I had to use that for something else. Emergency.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.181
Somebody else's roof.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.900
This here is an emergency too,
Mr. Riley, feel me?

08:07.029 --> 08:09.145
My roof is the only roof
you need to be worried about

08:09.281 --> 08:12.068
today, tomorrow and the next day.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.533
Yes, ma'am.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.027
Understood.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.739
I'm going to Baton Rouge
to see my kids and my husband.

08:20.876 --> 08:24.539
I'm back tomorrow. If that roof ain't right,
I'm going courtside on y'all.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.789
Shingles will be here. I swear.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.428
I've seen worse. What'd you get up in here?

08:34.556 --> 08:36.262
A foot, a foot and a half?

08:36.392 --> 08:40.135
— Bad enough. No insurance.
- No insurance?

08:40.270 --> 08:43.558
No flood insurance.
The bank said I didn't need it.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.556
I'm on piers, me.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.809
Never thought I'd get water up in here.

08:47.945 --> 08:51.779
— Ain't like Gentilly where you're at.
— Yeah, well.

08:51.907 --> 08:55.070
You sure you want
to sheetrock over all this?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.534
It gets wet, you gotta gut it again.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.075
In these old houses they knew
what they was doing.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.243
Cypress, plaster.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.617
Floods, just air it out.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.960
This plaster's not in bad shape.

09:07.089 --> 09:10.832
— Look at it. It's all cracked and shit.
— I can fix that for you.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.584
— Expensive?
— You want it done right?

09:13.721 --> 09:16.758
(Sighs) Let me think about it.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.176
I mean, what's the chances
it's gonna flood again?

09:19.309 --> 09:21.391
What's the chances it won't?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.135
Might be easier just to sheetrock it.

09:23.272 --> 09:27.436
— Easier, yeah. But you'll ruin the profile.
— Ain't that what people do?

09:27.568 --> 09:30.105
Tack sheetrock over perfectly good plaster?

09:30.237 --> 09:33.855
Sure. People do a lot of dumb shit
'cause it's easier.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.481
(Sighs)

09:36.535 --> 09:39.117
— Let me think about it, all right?
— All right.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.783
Got errands to run next couple of days
on my lunch break.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.282
— You gonna be here?
— Yeah, not a problem.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.630
J‘ You made my father

09:51.759 --> 09:53.295
J‘ Stone blind

09:57.139 --> 09:59.801
J‘ You ran my poor old mother

09:59.933 --> 10:03.050
J‘ Out of her mind

10:05.022 --> 10:09.641
J‘ I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun

10:09.777 --> 10:13.395
J‘ And shoot you four or five times

10:13.530 --> 10:16.897
J‘ And I'll stand over you, I'll watch you

10:17.034 --> 10:19.821
J‘ Finish dying

10:22.414 --> 10:24.871
J‘ Love, love, love

10:25.000 --> 10:28.333
J‘ Oh, careless love

10:28.462 --> 10:30.544
J‘ Yeah

10:30.672 --> 10:33.163
J‘ Love, oh love

10:33.300 --> 10:35.837
J‘ Oh, careless love

10:38.806 --> 10:42.344
J‘ You made me weep

10:42.476 --> 10:46.515
J‘ You made me moan

10:46.647 --> 10:49.389
J‘ You made me leave

10:49.525 --> 10:52.062
— (Coins jingle)
— J‘ My happy home

10:54.947 --> 10:59.407
J‘ You made me leave
J‘ Made me leave

10:59.535 --> 11:01.617
I My happy

11:01.745 --> 11:07.365
J‘ Home J‘

11:09.419 --> 11:11.671
— Thank you.
— Thank you.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.833
— Thanks a lot, guys.
- That was fantastic.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.376
Where are y'all from?

11:15.509 --> 11:16.874
— Wisconsin.
— Yeah, Madison.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.592
- Been here before?
— First time in New Orleans.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.552
(Woman 2) For me too.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.014
Well, it's different, huh, from Wisconsin?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.178
— Oh, yeah, way different.
— Yeah, definitely.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.267
We came down with our church group.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.103
To, you know, gut houses and stuff.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.642
God bless.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.640
We want you to know
we really appreciate what

11:33.777 --> 11:35.438
y'all are doing for New Orleans.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.607
— We wanted to help save it.
- Totally, yeah.

11:37.739 --> 11:38.819
Good luck with that.

11:38.949 --> 11:42.487
When we saw everything in the news,
what was going on in the Ninth Ward...

11:42.619 --> 11:44.951
— I mean, it's just so awful.
— So heartbreaking.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.742
(Sighs) Yeah, yeah, everybody talking
about the Lower Ninth.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.991
— Sonny.
— Let me ask you something.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.459
You ever even heard
of the Ninth Ward before the storm?

11:52.588 --> 11:55.421
— We||...
— So why are you so fired up about it now?

11:57.968 --> 12:00.425
Anybody have any requests?

12:00.554 --> 12:04.046
What about, I don't know,
something authentic?

12:04.182 --> 12:06.013
Something authentic.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.475
Real New Orleans music?

12:08.604 --> 12:11.767
— When The Saints Go Marching ln?
- I love that song.

12:11.899 --> 12:12.979
— OK.
— That's real, isn't it?

12:13.108 --> 12:16.271
Yeah, yeah, Saints is real all right.
Saints is as real as it gets.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.985
The thing is, traditionally, Saints is extra.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.570
— How come?
- Well...

12:20.699 --> 12:23.156
Because every cheesehead from Chowderland wants to
hear Saints.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.654
He's kidding. We love to play Saints.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.652
Yeah, we do. It's hip. It sends us.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.495
You know, you don't even have to play it.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.490
We do. You requested it.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.494
Actually, uh, you said Saints, not us.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.667
— 20 bucks. But only if you like it.
— (J‘ Percussive music)

12:37.799 --> 12:39.790
Annie.

12:48.435 --> 12:54.681
J‘ When the saints go marching in

12:54.816 --> 13:00.857
J‘ I want to be in that number

13:00.989 --> 13:06.484
J‘ Oh, when the saints go marching in J‘

13:06.620 --> 13:09.953
(I Dr. John:
When The Saints Go Marching ln)

13:11.667 --> 13:13.282
The good doctor.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.205
Yeah, a little voodoo dirge
to brighten up the day.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.875
An homage to you and Coco.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.872
That was historic, man.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.715
Darnell thought so too,

13:22.844 --> 13:25.381
butjust not in a positive sense.

13:25.514 --> 13:28.051
— Right.
— I had to remind him it was radio

13:28.183 --> 13:30.720
and that you couldn't
actually see the blood spurt.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.264
Yeah, best left to the imagination.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.308
I did what I could with soap and water,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.305
but you might want to paint over.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.730
Oh, hell, no, man. I say we leave it up there for the sheer
gris-gris of it.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.443
Don't fuck with it. That's bad juju.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.564
Darnell doesn't get it, man.
That was some deep New Orleans shit.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.566
You can't plan that kind of magic.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.318
The man has no sense of theater.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.786
So few do.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.202
Take care, Davis.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.414
All right.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.248
Can I help you?

14:02.884 --> 14:04.795
Yeah.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.303
I'm looking for George Cotrell.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.219
— He ain't been back.
— (Sighs)

14:11.351 --> 14:14.263
Keeping an eye on his house
till he comes home.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.728
— You heard from him?
- Nah.

14:16.857 --> 14:20.270
— Any idea where he at?
— My cousin says Oklahoma City.

14:20.402 --> 14:23.109
Oklahoma City? Man.

14:23.238 --> 14:27.902
Yeah, right. He'll be back, though,
when he get tired o' eating that food.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.447
(Laughs)

14:32.039 --> 14:34.405
Where I'm at. You hear from him,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.782
tell him his chief is looking for him.

14:36.918 --> 14:40.410
Big Chief Lambreaux, huh?
I heard George talk about you.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.458
How can I reach your cousin?

14:42.591 --> 14:45.628
Robbie? Man, he's still working on
getting a phone, him.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.298
Shit. Where he staying at?

14:48.430 --> 14:51.092
— Calliope.
— Calliope?

14:51.224 --> 14:54.216
The Calliope closed. All the projects closed.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.310
Squatting.
Man, Robbie been squatting down there.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.555
All right.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.727
Peace, baby.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.778
"In accordance with university policy."

15:07.783 --> 15:10.024
I mean, look at this. It's unbelievable.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.401
Two departments, like that.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.789
160 tenured professors.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.657
— How can they do that?
— How can they do that?

15:17.793 --> 15:21.285
Well, they can and they have and they did.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.208
It is a done deal.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.832
Gone. Civil engineering,
computer engineering,

15:26.968 --> 15:29.630
electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering,

15:29.763 --> 15:31.799
computer science.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.172
I mean, sure.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.173
Why would the university train people

15:35.310 --> 15:39.098
who know how to build things like, oh, say,

15:39.231 --> 15:42.189
computer systems, power grids, levees?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.148
Hey, who needs them?

15:44.277 --> 15:47.189
— Seems kind of crazy.
— Gee, you think?

15:47.322 --> 15:48.858
I mean, look what they're keeping.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.606
Musical theater, digital media,

15:51.743 --> 15:54.029
medieval studies, women's studies,

15:54.162 --> 15:56.027
Jewish studies, African studies.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.371
It's all about identity.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.037
Let's not learn how to actually do anything.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.034
Let's just sit and contemplate

16:03.171 --> 16:05.457
the glory of me

16:05.590 --> 16:08.206
in all my complexities.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.423
"Who am |?

16:09.553 --> 16:13.045
"I am black Jewish woman. Hear me roar."

16:14.182 --> 16:15.558
Jesus, what else?

16:15.684 --> 16:18.141
Russian.
Can't get along in the world without that.

16:18.270 --> 16:21.762
Portuguese. Well, that actually
could come in handy

16:21.898 --> 16:25.686
in case any Brazilians come up here
looking for Mardi Gras work.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.777
- What about English?
— We're useless. We're safe.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.736
I heard they might cut the grad program.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.777
Listen, if you have to transfer somewhere

16:32.909 --> 16:35.821
to finish your dissertation,
I'll keep working with you.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.366
Fuck, I might even go with you.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.410
The thought of teaching intro lit
to a bunch of freshmen

16:41.543 --> 16:43.499
who haven't read anything more challenging

16:43.628 --> 16:46.745
than Harry fucking Potter
makes me want to puke.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.962
Maybe I'll just chuck teaching altogether

16:51.094 --> 16:53.631
— and finish my novel.
— The one about the flood?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.845
The 1927 flood, right.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.341
You know, what the hell?

16:59.477 --> 17:01.934
I'm already 250 pages in.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.223
Maybe it's time to tackle that bad boy again.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.355
(Chuckles)

17:09.487 --> 17:12.149
Couldn't be more topical, right?

17:14.618 --> 17:18.782
Davis, didn't we recently
float you a sizable sum?

17:18.914 --> 17:22.452
Right after Thanksgiving. $750.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.792
— Thank you, Melba.
— Thank you, Melba. 700.

17:25.921 --> 17:28.788
Pop owed me 50
from the LSU—Alabama game.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.290
Would you mind bringing in
the plants from the patio?

17:31.426 --> 17:32.711
What for?

17:32.844 --> 17:35.085
Radio says there's
a hard freeze warning tonight.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.087
That's for the Northshore, sugar.

17:37.224 --> 17:41.183
They'll be all right. l'll cover 'em.

17:42.604 --> 17:45.311
My situation became untenable.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.147
Darling, what does that mean?

17:48.276 --> 17:50.688
— (Doorbell)
— Davis.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.312
— Papa.
— Roger. Davis needs a newjob.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.155
No, a loan. I need a loan.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.822
— What happened to WWOZ?
— I'm moving on.

17:59.955 --> 18:03.322
Well, maybe you can find something
that pays an actual salary.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.914
They paid me.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.785
Senior staff. Fundraising expertise.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.287
Plus, you forget, I have my gigs.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.675
Everyone's looking for good help.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.338
That's true. The city is desperate, darling.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.177
One of my patients mentioned something.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.171
A hotel in the Quarter.

18:21.184 --> 18:24.768
— What about the loan?
— Contingent upon.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.438
All right.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.433
(Desiree) We got bills to pay.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.275
(Sighs) I'm trying, baby.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.270
What can I say, Desiree? I got ajob.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.363
Difference between a gig and a job, Antoine.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.357
You gotta get a job.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.826
I got a job. I'm with Kermit.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.617
That's a gig once a week
and it don't pay enough.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.411
And you come home
smelling like cigarettes and pussy.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.249
Now, you see, that ain't true.
That ain't pussy.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.837
Well, what is it if it ain't pussy?

18:54.009 --> 18:56.967
— Barbecue.
— Barbecue?

18:57.095 --> 18:58.676
Yeah, Kermit's barbecue.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.093
Kermit barbecue tastes right,
but not that right.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.890
Some people swear by it.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.850
A gig, not ajob.

19:09.983 --> 19:13.100
— ln Algiers. Don't wait up.
- A gig in Algiers?

19:13.236 --> 19:15.397
Algiers, all the way to the West Bank.

19:15.530 --> 19:18.442
For you, girl, I'm crossing
mighty rivers and shit.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.283
Get a job job, God damn it.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.903
— (Woman) Tyrell!
— Yes, ma'am.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.531
Get your ass in this house!

19:27.667 --> 19:29.953
Toni's working with these lawyers.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.828
They're checking all the parishes.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.671
Alcide, elbows.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.635
— You tell your mama?
- Uh-uh.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.221
I don't want to get her hopes up,
not till we know for sure.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.591
— Know what?
— Where your Uncle David at.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.433
How's the roof?

19:47.562 --> 19:50.599
The contractor'll say for sure
when | get back tomorrow.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.519
You're leaving tomorrow?

19:53.651 --> 19:56.893
Don't do that, Alcide.
Don't sulk. I'll be back next week.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.112
l have to check on Nanan,
take care of the bar.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.983
You know, your mother could move up here,

20:03.119 --> 20:05.861
be close to the kids.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.163
She should move up here.
There's no doctors,

20:09.292 --> 20:11.157
there's no hospitals there.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.252
New Orleans is no place to be old, not now.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.794
You know why
she can't move up here right now.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.541
Besides, it's her home.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.338
She's never been anyplace else.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.257
Not even Baton Rouge?

20:23.390 --> 20:26.257
No, baby, not even Baton Rouge.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.262
We, um...

20:32.399 --> 20:34.981
We should talk about
putting the bar on the market...

20:35.944 --> 20:38.481
once the roofs fixed.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.195
People are looking for houses
to live in right now, not bars.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.155
People always need a drink...

20:43.284 --> 20:45.866
(Chuckles) ..now more than ever.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.031
Gigi's got a loyal clientele.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.997
— Who is Gigi, anyway?
— Nobody knows, darling.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.287
That's just the name it came with.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.378
Been Gigi's for as long
as anybody can remember.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.295
I grew up in that bar.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.838
Daddy left it to me.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.509
My practice is here now, LaDonna.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.348
The kids are in school.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.718
Our life is here.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.985
(LaDonna) Mm.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.443
(Gurgling)

21:22.615 --> 21:25.072
That's nasty, Daddy.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.487
It will clear. It's just gotta run.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.997
— I'd get a filter.
— Hm.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.364
When the power
supposed to come back on?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.491
Entergy man was here this morning.

21:43.928 --> 21:47.546
— You got plans for the holidays?
- Stay here, I guess.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.263
You should come to Houston.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.633
Davina gonna burn through
every one of Mama's recipes.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.351
Your sister and l parted on fractious terms.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.221
She's gonna be more mad at me than you.

21:56.357 --> 21:59.269
I talked to her today. She's thinking
I can come all the way down here

21:59.402 --> 22:00.938
and rustle you back to Houston.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.106
You could tell her I tried harder than I did.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.819
— Let me call you out for stubborn.
- (Chuckles)

22:07.952 --> 22:09.863
Come on, Daddy.
You know she wants to see you.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.033
— Cheri coming in from Atlanta with the kids.
— And you?

22:14.125 --> 22:17.583
I got gigs. But I'll definitely
be there Christmas Day.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.577
In and out like always.

22:19.714 --> 22:22.421
Never could stand
to be around us for too long.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.836
Oh, man, come on. It ain't like that.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.715
In fact, I'm gonna stay around
a couple more days.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.634
Got a recording session.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.884
Toussaint.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.932
Toussaint, huh?

22:37.065 --> 22:39.147
You deigning to play local?

22:39.275 --> 22:40.890
Yeah, I'm deigning.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.769
You don't think I can play straight—up
New Orleans R&B in my sleep?

22:43.905 --> 22:46.772
(Laughs) But can you swing?

22:48.243 --> 22:50.404
Not all you modern jazz cats can, you know.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.402
You sound like Wynton.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.404
I hope so.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.623
So what about Sunday?

22:56.751 --> 22:58.457
lndian practice. You find anybody?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.622
I'm working on it.

23:00.755 --> 23:03.337
Some up in Baton Rouge,
some over in Houston,

23:03.466 --> 23:04.922
some I don't know where yet.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.093
| wish I could stay, Daddy.

23:09.222 --> 23:12.134
Got a full plate up in New York.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.767
Lincoln Center.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.763
— A lot of love for New Orleans right now.
- Mm, I know.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.936
Everybody loves New Orleans music.

23:23.861 --> 23:26.728
New Orleans people...

23:31.244 --> 23:33.109
..round the damn clock.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.157
Requisitioned a boat
from one of my neighbors.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.790
Ten days straight. It was heavy.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.831
I seen stuff would curl your hair.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.080
Shit, lwas in Anbar, baby.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.672
You're not curling his hair.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.757
- (Laughs)
— I'm sure it don't compare.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.922
How many you rescue, all told?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.341
A couple of dozen, maybe,

23:53.474 --> 23:56.432
plucking them off rooftops, out of the trees.

23:57.687 --> 24:00.349
I thought they made everyone
leave after a week.

24:00.481 --> 24:01.641
Mandatory evac.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.435
We said, "fuck that."

24:05.695 --> 24:08.027
Grabbed all the bottled water
and beer we could find,

24:08.156 --> 24:10.863
— borrowed a generator.
— You were digging in, uh?

24:10.992 --> 24:13.358
National Guard patrols
would go through after curfew.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.621
Annie would go out and flash 'em.

24:15.747 --> 24:18.363
- Really?
— Yeah, like it was Mardi Gras come early.

24:18.499 --> 24:22.538
— And they'd drive away happy, man.
— Yeah, I hear that too.

24:22.670 --> 24:26.379
No rules. Just making it up
as we went along.

24:26.507 --> 24:30.170
We'd go out, do what had to be done,
man up, you know?

24:30.303 --> 24:32.294
I do.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.546
I bet you two had a lot of sex, huh?

24:34.682 --> 24:36.388
(Chuckles)

24:36.517 --> 24:39.008
Yeah, it was paradise, man,

24:39.145 --> 24:41.010
the Garden of fucking Eden.

24:41.147 --> 24:45.481
(Belches) Excuse me.
Gotta go see a man about a horse.

24:55.745 --> 24:58.532
Did he really do all that hero shit
during the storm?

24:59.791 --> 25:03.033
- He says he did.
— You believe him?

25:04.045 --> 25:05.626
I wasn't in the boat.

25:08.049 --> 25:10.711
(Man) Welcome to the Spotted Cat.
This is a new one,

25:10.843 --> 25:13.425
dedicated to everybody
who hasn't come home yet.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.545
(Man) Yeah, baby.

25:25.525 --> 25:29.484
J‘ I hope you're coming back to New Orleans

25:29.612 --> 25:33.821
J‘ You know it really is that land of dreams

25:33.950 --> 25:36.282
J‘ There's no other city

25:36.411 --> 25:40.370
J‘ Like New Orleans

25:42.625 --> 25:46.618
J‘ I knew that ljust couldn't stay away

25:46.754 --> 25:51.123
J‘ So I came back and now I'm home to stay

25:51.259 --> 25:58.097
J‘ Rebuild my life in New Orleans J‘

26:02.270 --> 26:03.976
Lucky to have you.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.936
My pleasure. What about next week?

26:06.065 --> 26:09.307
No, Bobby's back next week.
I heard about something on Bourbon Street.

26:09.444 --> 26:12.561
- Bourbon Street?
— There's pride on Bourbon Street.

26:12.697 --> 26:15.985
— Pete, Al, Gary Brown.
- Back in the day.

26:16.117 --> 26:18.403
There's cats there now
that can hold their heads up.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.618
— Let me get that number.
— All right.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.907
Hey!

26:26.043 --> 26:28.170
—(Laughs)
— Antoine Batiste.

26:28.296 --> 26:31.880
- Maestro, I didn't see you.
— Slipped in at the end of the last set.

26:32.008 --> 26:36.297
— What you doing over here?
— Living with my daughter. Lost her roof.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.512
We all in a FEMA trailer
parked in her driveway.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.505
What about your house?

26:41.642 --> 26:46.636
Like | tell folks, I had a foot and a half
of water on my second floor.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.476
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.108
Man, | used to dread going over
to your house after school.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.102
— l was that hard on you?
- No.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.855
It was those two buses
going to Bayou St. John.

26:57.992 --> 27:01.280
Fighting them white kids on Esplanade going, Seventh
Ward kids coming home.

27:01.412 --> 27:04.074
— You were easy.
— My best student.

27:04.207 --> 27:06.619
No, I wasn't. Freddie Lonzo was.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.662
Yeah, you're right.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.831
All right. You playing?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.703
Don't even have a horn, me.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.498
You lost all your instruments?

27:15.635 --> 27:17.375
Even the 'bone that Kid Ory gave you?

27:17.512 --> 27:21.926
Should have put all that stuff
on the second floor, but I didn't.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.265
Oh, man.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.520
That's tragic, really.

27:28.856 --> 27:32.599
— One of the good gigs, huh?
— That's what I hear.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.861
- Bourbon Street.
— Nothing to be ashamed of.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.196
Pride on Bourbon Street.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.533
Yeah, that's what they say.

27:44.956 --> 27:48.915
(Albert) His cousin says
he's been squatting here in the Calliope.

27:49.043 --> 27:51.500
We had squatters. Run them off.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.494
Ain't cheap, all this security.

27:53.631 --> 27:56.338
Spend all this moneyjust to seal these up?

27:56.467 --> 27:57.752
I know.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.262
People want to come home, no place to live.

28:00.388 --> 28:03.972
You know they've been wanting
to tear these projects down for years.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.056
Yeah, but now when there's a crying need...

28:06.185 --> 28:09.973
— Calliope didn't take much water.
- Most of 'em didn't take none.

28:10.106 --> 28:14.099
Stood up to the wind just fine.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.726
You know when these houses
were built? '40s.

28:16.863 --> 28:20.276
They've been through some hurricanes.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.525
— It makes no sense.
- Nope.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.652
Yeah, what does these days?

28:27.331 --> 28:29.947
— (Baby chattering)
— (Music playing)

28:42.096 --> 28:44.087
(Knock at door)

28:50.021 --> 28:51.306
(Knocking)

28:59.739 --> 29:01.730
Oh.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.283
Oh, it's a...

29:09.415 --> 29:13.829
— Alcide made it in art class.
- Thanks.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.919
- It's good.
— It's an elephant.

29:17.048 --> 29:20.586
- Oh, yeah.
— And you ought to come see your kids.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.377
Oh, uh, Desiree, this is LaDonna.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.596
You know, my ex. Y'all met, right?

29:30.269 --> 29:31.770
And who is this?

29:31.896 --> 29:34.433
Honore Antoinette Batiste.

29:37.735 --> 29:40.021
Didn't tell me you had a new baby.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.359
— Never came up.
- (Chuckles)

29:45.117 --> 29:47.779
I'll tell your sons they have a new half—sister.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.829
Another one.

29:57.088 --> 29:59.704
- Never came up?
— Come on now, baby.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.378
Don't you "baby" me. And what does
she mean by "another one"?

30:03.511 --> 30:05.092
You know...

30:11.268 --> 30:14.852
So, pretty straightfonNard.
Any questions about the system?

30:14.981 --> 30:18.189
Check in, check out, credit cards, parking?

30:18.317 --> 30:20.182
No, like you say, straightfonNard.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.731
And if guests need dinner reservations
or anything,

30:22.863 --> 30:24.728
just refer them to the concierge.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.821
Concierge?

30:26.951 --> 30:28.862
Got it.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.043
(Sighs)

30:56.355 --> 30:57.891
Oh, uh—uh.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.276
l'm—a kill that man twice.

31:01.402 --> 31:03.267
(Door slams)

31:03.404 --> 31:06.020
You seen that son of a bitch Riley?

31:06.157 --> 31:08.648
— Nope.
— l'm—a book his ass.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.116
He been here at all?

31:11.245 --> 31:12.860
Nope.

31:13.914 --> 31:16.872
Toni, what are you doing here?

31:17.001 --> 31:19.413
— We found him, LaDonna.
— What?

31:19.545 --> 31:22.878
David. Daymo. We know where he is.

31:35.436 --> 31:38.303
- Where you been?
— I had to step out. What's the problem?

31:38.439 --> 31:41.021
Where are my tools?

31:42.651 --> 31:44.903
I wasn't gone but ten minutes.

31:49.617 --> 31:51.824
We still don't know why he was picked up
in the first place?

31:51.952 --> 31:53.817
Sheriff won't put me on a phone list

31:53.954 --> 31:56.286
till there's paperwork saying
I'm David's attorney.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.121
How long will that take?

31:58.250 --> 32:01.538
— It could take a few days.
— And then what?

32:01.670 --> 32:04.207
Well, we gotta get Daymo
in front of a judge.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.797
We drive up there, post bond, pay a fine,

32:06.926 --> 32:10.669
and assuming they're not holding him
on anything serious...

32:10.805 --> 32:13.387
— They'll let him go?
- Yeah.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.428
— It might take a few days.
- Why?

32:17.561 --> 32:21.679
The parishes get FEMA money
for every OPP prisoner they house,

32:21.816 --> 32:24.899
and some of them tend to drag their feet,
especially the poorer ones.

32:26.821 --> 32:29.107
I swear.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.490
I could front you. (Sighs)

32:33.619 --> 32:35.530
I could ask my son, come to that.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.403
Ain't the point, huh?

32:38.958 --> 32:40.619
I can get new tools.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.493
I let somebody punk me.

32:45.339 --> 32:47.330
I'll ask around.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.801
(Sighs)

32:56.767 --> 32:59.509
And the elevators are just across the lobby.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.139
I need to step out for a few minutes.

33:05.276 --> 33:08.143
If anybody needs to find anything on Bourbon Street, tell
them.

33:08.279 --> 33:10.270
If they need reservations
or directions anywhere,

33:10.406 --> 33:13.523
— even the Quarter, I'll be right back.
- OK.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.650
(Men chatting and laughing)

33:17.496 --> 33:20.454
Hey, which way to Bourbon Street,
little buddy?

33:22.543 --> 33:24.158
Just...

33:25.212 --> 33:28.170
OK, exit the front door...

33:29.842 --> 33:32.254
That's why they call it the Inn on Bourbon.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.601
Watch where you step.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.433
We always do.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.395
(Quietly) What the fuck?

33:58.913 --> 34:01.700
(Man) Donny, pay attention, man.
We're going over here.

34:05.336 --> 34:09.420
— Oh, Trombone Shorty, my man.
— Antoine Batiste.

34:09.548 --> 34:12.915
(Laughs) Hey, do you think the Hall
ever coming back?

34:13.052 --> 34:16.089
- Man, I don't know.
— Thanks for that second line, bro.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.462
Not a problem, man.

34:17.598 --> 34:20.305
Listen, if you ever need me
to fill in for you...

34:20.434 --> 34:23.176
My first call. You got a gig?

34:23.312 --> 34:25.644
Oh, nah, nah.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.934
No shame. There's pride on Bourbon Street.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.978
No, I'm just cutting through the Quarter,

34:30.110 --> 34:31.646
gonna go hang with Kermit.

34:31.779 --> 34:34.646
— I thought Kermit had a gig tonight.
— Oh, yeah, you're right.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.148
But, uh, you know, I'm gonna catch him
before he goes.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.820
Uh—huh.

34:38.953 --> 34:41.160
— See you, Shorty.
— Be good, Antoine.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.279
- See you, bro.
— Nice to see you.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.130
(J‘ Music playing through headphones)

35:11.151 --> 35:14.564
(J‘ Backing track playing)

35:19.827 --> 35:21.863
- (Music stops)
— Button, please.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.745
Joe Foxx, that piece,

35:25.874 --> 35:28.251
that moment that you and Sam just played...

35:29.128 --> 35:32.040
— Don't play that.
— (Laughter)

35:32.172 --> 35:34.208
At that spot we need Amedee and Breeze

35:34.341 --> 35:37.629
to really shine on the reeds,
so you have to be out of the way.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.340
So let's do it again.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.262
(J‘ Music starts)

35:42.391 --> 35:44.256
He thought he could slip it by you, eh?

35:44.393 --> 35:46.384
How about that?

36:06.081 --> 36:07.582
NOLA's great.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.790
Napoleon House around the corner,
great also.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.409
— Can we walk there?
- Mm-hm, yeah.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.414
St. Louis and Chartres.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.541
Thank you.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.633
Totally, but shouldn't we
stay close to the hotel?

36:23.766 --> 36:26.257
- Yeah, I don't know.
— Maybe we should ask someone.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.509
Can I help you?

36:28.645 --> 36:31.387
Maybe you can recommend
someplace where we can hear music?

36:31.523 --> 36:33.263
We heard Snug Harbor.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.733
Snug's good.
There's nothing wrong with Snug.

36:36.862 --> 36:37.977
Um...

36:39.281 --> 36:41.317
But if you want to get off the beaten path...

36:41.450 --> 36:43.315
Yeah, sure.

36:43.452 --> 36:44.783
- Don't we?
— Absolutely.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.448
I could tell. I said to myself,

36:46.580 --> 36:50.664
"Here are some intrepid young folk
in search of the real New Orleans."

36:50.793 --> 36:51.999
Right there.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.789
- Bullet's?
— Yeah, long story.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.628
Is the neighborhood... Is it safe?

36:56.757 --> 36:58.668
Never safer.
All the crime's gone to Houston.

36:58.801 --> 37:03.295
Give that to the cab driver. If he says anything, you tell him
that you're sure.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.012
— OK, thanks.
— (Man) All right, thank you.

37:06.141 --> 37:09.304
(Woman 1) Thanks.
(Woman 2) Oh, I'm so excited.

37:17.653 --> 37:21.362
Galactic is at d.b.a. Elvis, can you hang?

37:21.490 --> 37:24.607
That's a funk group like The Meters,
right, but white guys?

37:24.743 --> 37:27.280
You say that like it's a bad thing.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.779
It's been a long day, Sam. I don't know.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.328
Hey, Delmond, you tell this guy that New Orleans don't get
started till after midnight.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.543
— You're down, right?
— Yeah. Galactic? For real?

37:36.672 --> 37:39.004
A funky, good group.

37:39.133 --> 37:40.839
What else you need to hear, son?

37:40.968 --> 37:44.381
Well, I guess I could go and get gussied up and put on a
shirt that doesn't stink

37:44.513 --> 37:46.174
and maybe I can shoot down there later.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.968
- All right.
— You go back to the hotel room.

37:49.101 --> 37:51.683
You're in for the night. Don't lie to Big Sam.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.770
You know, you don't understand
the burdens of an Englishman abroad.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.731
I've got tea to steep and toast to burn.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.896
And then I've got my reputation
to think about.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.235
I've got four, five songs
to write before midnight...

38:02.364 --> 38:05.481
d.b.a., Elvis. Do not disappoint me.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.653
I would not dream of it.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.369
(Mouths)

38:47.034 --> 38:49.070
(Whistling)

39:03.550 --> 39:05.757
(Cheering)

39:05.886 --> 39:07.751
(Man) Thank you. Thank you, guys.

39:07.888 --> 39:09.753
How are y'all feeling?

39:09.890 --> 39:12.757
| see a lot of friends in here.

39:12.893 --> 39:14.724
We got a special guest in the house tonight,

39:14.853 --> 39:16.468
New Orleans's own Delmond Lambreaux.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.561
Sit in, man, come on.

39:19.566 --> 39:23.150
Put your hands together
and get him up here.

39:23.278 --> 39:26.315
Yeah, I got you. What's happening?

39:26.448 --> 39:28.439
Young man, get up here. What's up?

39:30.661 --> 39:33.323
— Blackbird special?
— Right behind you.

39:33.455 --> 39:36.538
— Safety meeting after the set?
— Desitively.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.535
I had no idea.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.121
Sorry, Chief.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.037
Like you didn't know.

41:03.170 --> 41:04.876
More than a thousand invested in there.

41:05.005 --> 41:06.745
Some of them tools you can't buy for money.

41:06.882 --> 41:10.340
They don't make 'em anymore.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.843
| just want my 250 back.

41:13.972 --> 41:17.009
I don't owe it to you.
The man you bought it from does.

41:17.851 --> 41:20.809
| see him. I'll be sure to mention it.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.223
(Dog barking in distance)

41:23.357 --> 41:25.439
A little sneak thief named Skinny.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.601
— Where he stay at?
— Gert Town.

41:28.737 --> 41:30.693
He around the town most nights, though.

41:31.365 --> 41:32.400
Where?

41:32.532 --> 41:35.399
Mid—City, Lower Garden, Muses.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.696
Copper mining.

41:40.957 --> 41:42.948
(J‘ Funk playing)

41:46.838 --> 41:50.501
Mm, this is the Seventh Ward, see.

41:50.634 --> 41:52.295
St. Aug's right up the street.

41:52.427 --> 41:55.089
— St. Aug?
— St. Augustine High School.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.463
Greatest damn marching band in the land.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.806
l'm Sixth Ward, me, across Esplanade.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.516
Why is it called Bullet's?

42:01.645 --> 42:03.601
See the proprietor over there?

42:04.398 --> 42:07.731
(Woman) The guy with the leather jacket
and that thingy around his neck?

42:09.027 --> 42:10.983
Oh, the chicken foot?
No, the dude next to him

42:11.113 --> 42:12.978
— with the baseball cap.
— Oh, yeah.

42:13.115 --> 42:15.356
— He got shot in the head.
- Really?

42:15.492 --> 42:17.699
Yeah, he walked into a store
to buy some cigarettes

42:17.828 --> 42:19.784
just when it was being robbed, straight up.

42:19.913 --> 42:21.699
And that's why they call it Bullet's?

42:21.832 --> 42:25.245
Uh—uh, no, it's called Bullet's

42:25.377 --> 42:28.460
'cause after he got shot,
the doctors left the bullet in there.

42:28.588 --> 42:31.295
They didn't want to take it out.
But he could feel it.

42:31.425 --> 42:33.711
Turned his head to the right,
the bullet slid left.

42:33.844 --> 42:35.960
Turned his head to the left, bullet slid right.

42:36.096 --> 42:38.303
It was driving him crazy,
so he tried to take it out

42:38.432 --> 42:40.673
on his own self with a straight razor.

42:40.809 --> 42:42.674
— No way.
— No.

42:42.811 --> 42:47.271
Yeah, so once he's done that,
his mother said, "You're crazy,"

42:47.399 --> 42:52.018
made him go back to the doctor
and get it taken out, you know, properly.

42:54.698 --> 42:58.111
That's a true story.
You could ask him if you don't believe me.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.575
(Kermit) I wanted to bring to the bandstand,

43:00.704 --> 43:02.990
straight from his Bourbon Street engagement,

43:03.123 --> 43:05.489
that notorious Antoine Batiste,

43:05.625 --> 43:07.365
but he all up in that pork over there.

43:07.502 --> 43:10.790
Damn right.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.755
Wash up, man. Get your 'bone, Batiste.

43:13.884 --> 43:16.125
Baby J, put that tray down.

43:16.261 --> 43:19.503
It's your time to shine, baby.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.254
Well...

43:21.391 --> 43:24.007
— You're gonna play?
- That's so cool.

43:24.144 --> 43:26.510
Yeah, you know,
I gotta give the people what they want.

43:26.646 --> 43:28.511
Listen, excuse me.

43:28.648 --> 43:31.105
I'll be right back. Don't you go nowhere.

43:31.902 --> 43:33.483
Oh, my God.

43:34.488 --> 43:37.070
J‘ Now I've been thinking what it means
to love New Orleans

43:37.199 --> 43:39.030
J‘ When you got a heavy jazz
and my red beans

43:39.159 --> 43:41.491
J‘ Mardi Gras day on Claiborne
in New Orleans

43:41.620 --> 43:43.781
J‘ And if you're from here,
then you know what that means

43:43.914 --> 43:45.996
J‘ l'm—a say what it was
'cause it ain't all as it seems

43:46.124 --> 43:48.206
J‘ I went to Joseph A. Craig
across the street from Treme

43:48.335 --> 43:51.543
J‘ Rolling out of there
when l was just about 15 J‘

43:51.671 --> 43:54.162
— Buy you ladies a drink?
- (Laughs)

43:54.299 --> 43:56.506
OK.

43:59.513 --> 44:03.097
(Chattering, laughing)

44:04.935 --> 44:06.971
(Man) Oh, shit, five—oh.

44:07.103 --> 44:09.560
— Whoa, whoa, whoa, five—oh, five—oh.
- (Siren whoops)

44:09.689 --> 44:13.227
- Shit. Oh, shit.
— (Man) Man, now what?

44:13.360 --> 44:14.475
So about that gig...

44:14.611 --> 44:17.603
(Man) Good evening, officers.
How y'all doing?

44:19.866 --> 44:21.902
Step back.

44:27.624 --> 44:28.864
Pick it up.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.867
— Officer...
— Don't make me ask you again.

44:41.388 --> 44:43.424
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back.

44:43.557 --> 44:46.390
- Shit.
— This ain't right, man.

44:46.518 --> 44:50.010
You want to go too? I'll run all y'all.

44:50.146 --> 44:53.104
— Hey, grab my horn, man.
- Yeah, man.

44:53.233 --> 44:56.441
— Anybody you want me to call?
- Nah.

44:56.570 --> 44:58.561
(Man) Fuck the police!

44:59.865 --> 45:01.321
As a matter of policy,

45:01.825 --> 45:03.656
we do not send guests
outside the French Quarter.

45:03.785 --> 45:06.777
— Liability issues.
— They wanted something more real.

45:06.913 --> 45:09.199
So you sent them to the Seventh Ward?

45:09.332 --> 45:11.323
They never came back
to their room last night.

45:11.459 --> 45:13.370
Is that your idea of real?

45:13.503 --> 45:16.961
They were due at the house
they were working on at eight this morning.

45:17.090 --> 45:20.332
It's now noon.
The church group is freaking out.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.959
Parents are flying in from Madison.

45:23.096 --> 45:26.088
And now the police are actively involved.

45:27.017 --> 45:29.349
Actively, NOPD? Isn't that an oxymoron?

45:29.477 --> 45:32.093
Mr. McAlary...

45:32.230 --> 45:35.438
at this point your position here is...

45:37.193 --> 45:40.321
- Untenable.
— That would be the word.

45:42.532 --> 45:46.366
This is so good, darling. Just yummy.

45:46.494 --> 45:48.655
I don't usually care for duck. Too rich.

45:48.788 --> 45:51.996
— But this is first—rate.
- Thank you.

45:52.125 --> 45:55.208
You don't think it's too rich?
Molasses and bourbon?

45:55.337 --> 45:57.544
That's what I like about it. It is so damn rich.

45:57.672 --> 46:00.835
You know what they say here.
If it's worth doing...

46:00.967 --> 46:02.377
(Both) It's worth overdoing.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.637
- (Door opens)
— Speaking of overdoing...

46:05.597 --> 46:08.430
Whoa, check it out.

46:08.558 --> 46:10.094
(Both laugh)

46:10.226 --> 46:14.014
For Madame,
a Creole cream cheese cannoli

46:14.147 --> 46:19.312
— with pistachios and satsuma sorbet.
- Oh, my.

46:19.444 --> 46:23.028
For monsieur, a sweet potato pecan tart

46:23.156 --> 46:25.488
with Steen's cane syrup.

46:25.617 --> 46:29.201
— Oh, Toto, we're not in Huntsville anymore.
—(Laughs)

46:29.329 --> 46:33.447
And to share, cafe au lait pot de creme

46:33.583 --> 46:36.325
with mudslide cookies.

46:36.461 --> 46:38.452
Just kill me. Kill me now.

46:38.588 --> 46:40.499
I'm trying, Daddy. Thank you, Jacques.

46:40.632 --> 46:42.168
(Jacques) De rien.

46:42.300 --> 46:43.915
I wanted you to taste the new menu

46:44.052 --> 46:46.384
so you'd know you're not
throwing good money after bad.

46:46.513 --> 46:48.720
Oh, we know you can cook, sweetheart.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.555
I had to fix the exhaust system

46:51.685 --> 46:54.392
and the roof just to reopen,
that was 50 grand,

46:54.521 --> 46:57.228
plus the new walk—in, that was another 20.

46:57.357 --> 47:01.475
— You told me you had insurance for all that.
— Insurance hasn't come through yet.

47:01.611 --> 47:03.192
I'm still waiting on my SBA loan.

47:03.321 --> 47:05.903
I had to use the contingency fund.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.943
That's what it's for, right?

47:08.076 --> 47:10.442
Thank God. But now I'm behind.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.411
If I can just...if I can just hang on

47:13.540 --> 47:15.872
until I can get staffed up, be open full—time,

47:16.001 --> 47:18.583
I can catch up a little, pay my bills.

47:18.712 --> 47:20.794
I mean, we're jammed every night.

47:20.922 --> 47:24.915
The restaurant is gangbusters, really.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.963
What do you need?

47:28.096 --> 47:30.803
20, 25.

47:32.892 --> 47:36.680
Once the insurance comes through,
I can pay you back.

47:36.813 --> 47:38.849
I know money's tight.

47:41.484 --> 47:43.065
We can do five.

47:48.074 --> 47:49.450
Or six.

47:49.576 --> 47:51.817
OK, that's...that's good.

47:51.953 --> 47:55.286
That'll help. I'll find the rest somewhere.

48:04.007 --> 48:05.292
A roach.

48:05.425 --> 48:07.757
I mean, give me a ticket.
But throw me in jail?

48:07.886 --> 48:09.751
Yeah, well, he had no choice.

48:09.888 --> 48:13.551
You were up in his face.
What he supposed to do, ignore it?

48:15.602 --> 48:21.313
— Thanks for dropping the car.
- It's OK. I'll take a taxi home.

48:21.441 --> 48:23.147
I'm gonna pay you back, you know.

48:23.276 --> 48:25.767
For going the bond.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.323
I'm sorry I can't stay for practice.

48:29.449 --> 48:31.189
You ain't never really cared for it.

48:31.326 --> 48:33.032
That ain't true.

48:33.161 --> 48:37.370
I loved growing up with the tradition,
but the Indians, that's your thing.

48:38.041 --> 48:40.282
Always was.

48:45.715 --> 48:47.501
This city...

48:56.309 --> 48:58.174
It's like they breed.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.176
Buckhead beef, Louisiana seafood,

49:00.313 --> 49:02.975
Captain Dino...have to pay
the shrimper, right?

49:03.108 --> 49:04.769
Triage. Comprends?

49:04.901 --> 49:08.860
Oui. Triage. C'est francais.

49:10.323 --> 49:12.609
Cusimano Produce, Brown's Dairy,

49:12.742 --> 49:16.576
— TLC Linens.
— Ask them can we go another 30?

49:16.704 --> 49:20.288
- If they say no?
— (Sighs) Take whatever they can give us.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.202
If they still say no?

49:22.335 --> 49:26.044
Pay Cusimano,
buy dairy at the farmer's market,

49:26.172 --> 49:28.788
and we'll start washing our own tablecloths.

49:44.149 --> 49:46.481
— You don't want to do that.
- The fuck?

49:47.443 --> 49:49.934
How long you been standing there?

49:50.071 --> 49:52.608
People just put that in.

49:52.740 --> 49:56.574
Oh, is this your house, man?
I'm sorry. I didn't know, man.

49:57.537 --> 50:00.654
I can build a house from scratch,
roof to foundation.

50:00.790 --> 50:03.623
What can you do, tear it down?

50:03.751 --> 50:07.369
- That's easy.
— OK, pops, I'm gone, man.

50:07.505 --> 50:10.872
- You took my tools.
— I didn't take no tools.

50:11.009 --> 50:14.422
You did. You just didn't know
who you were taking it from.

50:14.554 --> 50:18.888
OK, you somebody. Good for you.
But I didn't take no tools.

50:19.767 --> 50:22.975
You need to understand what I'm telling you.

50:24.063 --> 50:27.647
Fuck you, old man. Fuck that.

50:28.943 --> 50:31.025
Motherfucker!

50:42.373 --> 50:44.705
(Wrench clatters to ground)

51:22.372 --> 51:24.909
(Tower bells ringing)

51:36.928 --> 51:39.294
— Hey, it's the hotel guy.
— Oh!

51:39.430 --> 51:41.967
— Oh, hi.
- Hi.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.341
- Mwah!
— Oh. Good.

51:44.477 --> 51:47.560
— (All laugh)
— You guys OK?

51:47.689 --> 51:49.554
— The time of our lives.
- Oh, yeah.

51:49.691 --> 51:51.306
We met the most interesting man.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.103
Oh, my God, a tall guy. He had this, like,

51:53.236 --> 51:55.693
gold tooth with, like, a ruby thing on it.

51:55.822 --> 51:58.234
— Elmore?
— Yeah, Elmore.

51:58.366 --> 52:03.531
— Oh, my God.
— He showed us the best time.

52:03.663 --> 52:05.654
The real New Orleans!

52:05.790 --> 52:08.577
— Great. OK, great.
- It was the best.

52:08.710 --> 52:10.871
Did you guys check in with anyone?

52:14.632 --> 52:18.045
You might want to call the hotel.
They're a little concerned.

52:18.177 --> 52:20.338
We need to get some breakfast first.

52:20.471 --> 52:23.053
— We're a little hungover.
- OK.

52:23.182 --> 52:25.798
Clover Grill, Bourbon and Dumaine.

52:25.935 --> 52:27.800
Thanks. Thanks again, man.

52:27.937 --> 52:29.928
— Sure. Whoo!
- Yeah.

52:30.064 --> 52:34.228
— Whoo!
— Whoo!

52:34.360 --> 52:36.737
(Woman) Oh, my gosh, I'm so hungry.

52:36.863 --> 52:38.569
Like, starving.

52:38.698 --> 52:41.861
Now where the fuck
am I gonna eat breakfast?

52:41.993 --> 52:44.951
(J‘ Radio playing music)

52:52.420 --> 52:55.583
— I'm going.
— OK. Sofia ready?

52:55.715 --> 52:57.251
Can't you hear her pouting?

52:57.383 --> 52:59.419
(Laughs) Now that you mention it.

52:59.552 --> 53:02.009
You're working on a novel?

53:02.138 --> 53:03.674
Thinking about it.

53:03.806 --> 53:05.671
Timely.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.673
Which worries me.

53:07.810 --> 53:09.892
I don't want to be accused
of cashing in on the storm

53:10.021 --> 53:11.761
like some other schmucks I could mention.

53:11.898 --> 53:14.514
- You were there first.
— Did you get your hair cut?

53:14.650 --> 53:16.936
(Laughs) Last week.

53:17.070 --> 53:19.277
Well, it looks good.

53:19.405 --> 53:21.862
— Drive carefully.
— You too.

53:21.991 --> 53:23.947
— I'll see you tonight.
- Mm-hm.

53:26.412 --> 53:27.743
(Door closes)

53:27.872 --> 53:30.158
Ready?

53:30.291 --> 53:32.156
Come on, let's go.

53:32.293 --> 53:34.409
I need to get back home
at a reasonable hour.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.285
I hate boarding school.

53:36.422 --> 53:38.834
(Sighs)

53:38.966 --> 53:41.173
Another week or so,
you're home for the holidays

53:41.302 --> 53:43.042
and you're back to stay.

53:43.179 --> 53:44.840
It's a sea cruise, honey.

53:44.972 --> 53:46.837
Where am I gonna go to school?

53:46.974 --> 53:50.216
Tulane's working on something
for faculty kids. Lusher.

53:50.353 --> 53:52.093
Lusher's not a high school, daddy.

53:52.230 --> 53:55.347
They're adding a high school.

53:55.483 --> 53:58.691
— Plus, it's public.
— Not anymore. It's charter.

53:58.820 --> 54:00.685
Where are they gonna put the high school?

54:00.822 --> 54:03.404
(Sighs) They're taking over Fortier.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.236
What about the Fortier kids?

54:06.369 --> 54:08.985
— Where are they gonna go?
— Somewhere else, I guess.

54:09.122 --> 54:12.364
— That's not fair.
— Probably not.

54:12.500 --> 54:14.365
It's where we're at now.

54:14.502 --> 54:16.367
Do you want to go to school
in New Orleans?

54:18.172 --> 54:20.629
So this is how it works.
It's a zero sum world.

54:20.758 --> 54:24.626
Somebody wins, somebody loses.
Come on, honey.

54:29.308 --> 54:30.764
(Sighs)

54:50.621 --> 54:51.997
This is not my son.

54:52.123 --> 54:54.956
- Ma'am?
— There's been a mistake.

54:55.877 --> 54:58.289
— David Brooks.
— No, it's not.

54:59.088 --> 55:00.828
Tell them your name.

55:00.965 --> 55:03.206
Like he say, Dave Brooks.

55:03.342 --> 55:06.755
Not my David. Not my boy.

55:09.682 --> 55:11.673
Where's your brother?

55:12.852 --> 55:14.467
I don't know.

55:27.867 --> 55:30.074
I heard you was looking for me.

Open in a couple of weeks maybe.
