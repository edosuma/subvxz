WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:03.482
Previously on.

00:03.517 --> 00:09.344
"Survivor," at the manu tribe,
Wendy was making enemies.

00:09.379 --> 00:11.068
Wendy let the chickens go.

00:11.103 --> 00:13.517
She kind of went nuts.

00:13.551 --> 00:15.113
At the kama tribe, joe
Thought he was making friends.

00:15.137 --> 00:17.551
I feel great with you, bro.

00:17.586 --> 00:19.482
I feel great with you, too.

00:19.517 --> 00:22.482
I acted like I love him, but
He's a returning player, and he.

00:22.517 --> 00:23.724
Can be really dangerous.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.586
At the lesu tribe,
David and devon saw eye to eye.

00:26.620 --> 00:30.689
I'm not going to write your
Name down no matter what.

00:30.724 --> 00:32.551
And so did lauren and Kelley.

00:32.586 --> 00:34.172
I want to vote with you.

00:34.206 --> 00:36.034
Yeah, I want to vote with You.

00:36.068 --> 00:37.827
Leaving wardog in the Middle.

00:37.862 --> 00:38.862
It's classic.

00:38.896 --> 00:40.793
I'm in a swing-vote spot.

00:40.827 --> 00:44.275
At tribal council,
Wardog made up his mine.

00:44.310 --> 00:49.965
Devon, the tribe has spoken.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.655
Leaving devens with a de
To make.

00:53.689 --> 01:01.689
Grab a torch and go to the edge
Of distinction or go home.

01:03.724 --> 01:11.724
Grab a torch and go to the edge
Of distinction or go home.

01:13.793 --> 01:15.862
I was voted out last night.

01:15.896 --> 01:18.517
I thought I was going home and
Eating a burger and drinking a.

01:18.551 --> 01:19.758
Beer.

01:19.793 --> 01:23.206
I get thrown on to the edge of
Distinction with three people.

01:23.241 --> 01:26.965
Who are so happy I failed.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.344
Everything about edge of
Distinction, starting with that.

01:30.379 --> 01:33.206
Big map just says, you don't
Want to be here, you're not.

01:33.241 --> 01:37.965
Going to enjoy yourself, it's
Going to suck.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.758
You okay?

01:40.793 --> 01:43.182
But to me it's just another
Test put in front of you where.

01:43.206 --> 01:46.275
It's like, do you have the
Fortitude to go into something.

01:46.310 --> 01:54.310
You know nothing about and see
It through and come out on top?Ñ.

01:56.344 --> 02:04.344
You know nothing about and see
It through and come out on top?Ñ.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
Come on in, guys.

02:20.517 --> 02:26.241
Kama, manu getting your first
Look at the new lesu tribe.

02:26.275 --> 02:28.310
Devens voted out at the last
Tribal council.

02:28.344 --> 02:29.344
All right.

02:29.379 --> 02:31.172
Shall we get to today's reward
Challenge?

02:31.206 --> 02:32.275
Yes.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.907
For today's
Challenge, you'll race through a.

02:33.931 --> 02:40.931
Series of obstacles collecting
Bolos along the way.

02:40.965 --> 02:46.517
You'll then attempt to land
Those bolos on a target.

02:46.551 --> 02:49.068
First two tribes to finish win
Reward.

02:49.103 --> 02:50.620
Want to know what you're playing
For?

02:50.655 --> 02:51.862
Yeah.

02:51.896 --> 02:54.275
First tribe to
Finish, a little something from.

02:54.310 --> 02:55.482
Home.

02:55.517 --> 02:57.034
My gosh.

02:57.068 --> 03:00.758
Peanut butter and
Jelly, peanut butter and jelly,

03:00.793 --> 03:05.034
First tribe to finish plus a jar
Of peanut butter and jelly, loaf.

03:05.068 --> 03:06.551
Of bread and ice cold milk.

03:06.586 --> 03:10.379
Second tribe to finish, not as
Much, a small plate of p.B. And.

03:10.413 --> 03:11.068
J.

03:11.103 --> 03:14.551
Last tribe to finish, nothing.

03:14.586 --> 03:16.482
Kama, you have one extra person.

03:16.517 --> 03:17.103
Sitting someone out.

03:17.137 --> 03:17.896
Who is it going to be in.

03:17.931 --> 03:18.827
I'll sit.

03:18.862 --> 03:20.241
Eula, take a spot on The bench.

03:20.275 --> 03:21.655
Manu, one extra person.

03:21.689 --> 03:23.000
Aubry, take a spot on the bench.

03:23.034 --> 03:31.034
Everybody else, take a minute to
Strategize and we'll get going.

03:34.655 --> 03:35.310
All right.

03:35.344 --> 03:37.275
Here we go.

03:37.310 --> 03:41.310
For reward, survivors ready?

03:41.344 --> 03:42.827
Go!

03:42.862 --> 03:45.896
First you got to get through the
Rope bramble.

03:45.931 --> 03:47.724
Nothing easy about this.

03:47.758 --> 03:49.103
Launch yourself through it.

03:49.137 --> 03:50.724
Julie comes out.

03:50.758 --> 03:51.793
Wendy is through.

03:51.827 --> 03:52.689
Wardog is through.

03:52.724 --> 03:55.034
Wentworth is through.

03:55.068 --> 03:55.793
Manu, you're good.

03:55.827 --> 03:56.793
Start working.

03:56.827 --> 03:58.482
Kama, you're good.

03:58.517 --> 03:59.517
Lesu, you're good.

03:59.551 --> 04:03.655
You got to lift someone up to
Get the two bolos.

04:03.689 --> 04:06.793
David almost dropped by his
Tribe.

04:06.827 --> 04:07.862
Hold me.

04:07.896 --> 04:08.655
Hold me.

04:08.689 --> 04:11.551
David struggling Again.

04:11.586 --> 04:14.482
Julie has the first for kama.

04:14.517 --> 04:17.034
Victoria has the first for manu.

04:17.067 --> 04:21.654
This group of four on lesu
Continues to struggle in every.

04:21.689 --> 04:23.068
Challenge.

04:23.103 --> 04:27.758
David goes down hard.

04:27.793 --> 04:30.034
You're good, manu.

04:30.068 --> 04:32.862
You're good, kama.

04:32.896 --> 04:37.827
Now you got to crawl to get your
Next two bolos.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.344
Give me your hand!

04:39.379 --> 04:43.103
Now it's lauren
Trying to get up.

04:43.137 --> 04:45.931
Absolute disaster for lesu.

04:45.965 --> 04:48.931
They finally have lauren out.

04:48.965 --> 04:50.310
Go, go!

04:50.344 --> 04:53.310
Kama has your next Two.

04:53.344 --> 04:55.482
You can start throwing, kama.

04:55.517 --> 04:57.586
Manu has their four.

04:57.620 --> 04:59.448
You're good, manu.

04:59.482 --> 05:03.275
Every tribe member has to land
One bolo.

05:03.310 --> 05:05.275
Got to throw way harder.

05:05.310 --> 05:08.206
Lauren still working
On that last bolo.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.551
She's got it.

05:09.586 --> 05:11.517
Dammit, wardog.

05:11.551 --> 05:16.724
And a big fall by Lauren.

05:16.758 --> 05:17.655
Gavin's first for manu.

05:17.689 --> 05:18.931
Their first.

05:18.965 --> 05:21.103
Lesu fighting to stay in this
Peanut butter and jelly.

05:21.137 --> 05:21.517
Challenge.

05:21.551 --> 05:22.655
Go, wardog!

05:22.689 --> 05:24.931
Wentworth is through.

05:24.965 --> 05:25.413
Wardog.

05:25.448 --> 05:26.517
You're good, lesu.

05:26.551 --> 05:27.068
Start throwing.

05:27.103 --> 05:28.724
It is manu with one.

05:28.758 --> 05:30.620
Nobody else on the board.

05:30.655 --> 05:31.310
Lauren tosses.

05:31.344 --> 05:35.655
She just misses.

05:35.689 --> 05:37.172
You got it.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.206
Aurora on and off.

05:39.241 --> 05:40.310
Eric with a nice touch.

05:40.344 --> 05:43.379
And that will work.

05:43.413 --> 05:45.241
Ron now up for kama.

05:45.275 --> 05:47.034
Ron withçó a nice toss.

05:47.068 --> 05:47.862
That will hook.

05:47.896 --> 05:51.827
Ron has the first for kama.

05:51.862 --> 05:56.137
Joe with one toss lands the
Second.

05:56.172 --> 05:58.103
You have to land four.

05:58.137 --> 05:59.551
Wendy scores the third for manu.

05:59.586 --> 06:02.586
It is now manu with three and
Kama with two.

06:02.620 --> 06:03.724
Lesu still with nothing.

06:03.758 --> 06:05.310
Can I go yet?

06:05.344 --> 06:09.068
There goes david now
Trying to get into it for lesu.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.862
David just misses.

06:10.896 --> 06:14.137
David sprinting back to get his
Bolo.

06:14.172 --> 06:15.068
Victoria for the win.

06:15.103 --> 06:20.103
Nice and soft but going to fall
Short.

06:20.137 --> 06:21.689
Aurora scores the third for
Kama.

06:21.724 --> 06:25.275
It is now manu with three and
Kama with three.

06:25.310 --> 06:29.034
It is victoria versus julie for
The win.

06:29.068 --> 06:31.068
Just short.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.862
Julie can win it right here.

06:33.896 --> 06:35.586
And she does!

06:35.620 --> 06:37.827
Kama wins reward.

06:37.862 --> 06:40.172
We're looking for second.

06:40.206 --> 06:42.896
Wentworth launches and sticks
It.

06:42.931 --> 06:44.172
Victoria for the win.

06:44.206 --> 06:45.413
Just misses.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.758
Guys, I'm so tired.

06:46.793 --> 06:48.931
Wardog now in.

06:48.965 --> 06:51.241
And he snags the second for
Lesu.

06:51.275 --> 06:53.068
Suddenly lesu is back in it.

06:53.103 --> 06:54.068
Here goes lauren.

06:54.103 --> 06:56.310
Just short.

06:56.344 --> 07:00.000
For the win, victoria.

07:00.034 --> 07:01.758
And she does it!

07:01.793 --> 07:08.068
Manu wins reward, peanut butter
And jelly, leaving lesu empty.

07:08.103 --> 07:12.517
Handed once again.

07:12.551 --> 07:16.344
Kama, the five of you have lost
One challenge this entire.

07:16.379 --> 07:17.482
Season.

07:17.517 --> 07:18.758
Big victory today.

07:18.793 --> 07:23.586
Huge reward of p.B. And j will
Be waiting for you back at camp.

07:23.620 --> 07:26.620
Grab your stuff, head become and
Enjoy it.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.620
Manu, nice victory for you.

07:28.655 --> 07:32.068
Your p.B. And j. Will be waiting
For you.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.000
Grab your stuff, head back to
Camp.

07:34.034 --> 07:34.448
Enjoy the afternoon.

07:34.482 --> 07:35.793
Thanks, jeff.

07:35.827 --> 07:36.551
Wow.

07:36.586 --> 07:37.793
Yeah.

07:37.827 --> 07:40.896
I think we're running out of
Adjectives to describe these.

07:40.931 --> 07:41.827
Defeats.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.551
It's almost like we're cursed or
Something.

07:43.586 --> 07:48.551
We have to think positive, and
We keep going back and saying.

07:48.586 --> 07:49.665
That, we have to think positive.

07:49.689 --> 07:53.103
It's the only way out of this.

07:53.137 --> 07:53.793
Interesting.

07:53.827 --> 07:55.586
I didn't even ask a question.

07:55.620 --> 07:58.896
You already know the story that
Is unfolding.

07:58.931 --> 08:00.034
All right.

08:00.068 --> 08:01.108
Lesu, got nothing for you.

08:01.137 --> 08:02.344
Grab your stuff.

08:02.379 --> 08:03.068
Head back to camp.

08:03.103 --> 08:07.103
God, like how bad can we be?

08:07.137 --> 08:09.655
You have david, who basically
Acts as a female.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.137
I mean, he weighs less than me.

08:12.172 --> 08:14.310
Basically we have three girls
And wardog.

08:14.344 --> 08:20.379
So I'm just trying to figure out
What to do, because we can't win.

08:20.413 --> 08:22.241
Anything.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:33.758 --> 08:37.793
One, two, three, kama!

08:37.827 --> 08:40.861
Winning that reward just
Showed us once again that the.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.734
Kama tribe is a force to be
Reckoned with in this game.

08:42.758 --> 08:47.896
We are completely dominating and
We're on this winning streak.

08:47.931 --> 08:49.137
Love you guys so much.

08:49.172 --> 08:50.965
You guys killed that.

08:52.310 --> 08:54.527
However, it is in the back of
My mind that joe is the biggest.

08:54.551 --> 08:58.413
Threat in the game right now, so
I would rather get him out of.

08:58.448 --> 09:00.724
This game sooner rather than
Later.

09:00.758 --> 09:03.758
How lucky are we?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.034
We're spoiled.

09:05.068 --> 09:08.137
We're all love and sunshine
And sprinkles and rainbows right.

09:08.172 --> 09:12.034
Now on kama strong, but it's
Pretty obvious that I'm a big.

09:12.068 --> 09:15.310
Target and that I'm a challenge
Beast, so it sucks.

09:15.344 --> 09:19.517
It's really difficult to try to
Shake that stigma.

09:19.551 --> 09:22.517
So I'm just trying to do
Anything I can to make it.

09:22.551 --> 09:25.310
Comfortable for my tribe mates,
Make them feel like they need me.

09:25.344 --> 09:33.344
So that I'm not the one going
Home.

09:35.379 --> 09:41.000
So that I'm not the one going
Home.

09:41.034 --> 09:43.068
Where's joe right now?

09:43.103 --> 09:44.344
At the beach.

09:44.379 --> 09:48.344
This is like our one shot to
Get him out premerge probably.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.413
Joe's dangerous.

09:50.448 --> 09:55.793
But there three of us, if we can
Blind side him, it would be.

09:55.827 --> 09:56.620
Huge.

09:56.655 --> 09:58.344
I'm in a good situation
Game-wise.

09:58.379 --> 10:01.896
And since day one, I kept
Telling everyone we have to get.

10:01.931 --> 10:05.931
Rid of joe, but now I have
Another consideration.

10:05.965 --> 10:07.241
Joe is a workhorse.

10:07.275 --> 10:10.448
I mean, he knows everything, and
A lot of our people on our tribe.

10:10.482 --> 10:12.068
Do not.

10:12.103 --> 10:13.620
We're not catching the fish.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.034
And we're not getting all the
Food.

10:16.068 --> 10:19.103
We don't know what to do.

10:19.137 --> 10:22.137
And so I'm starting to realize,
I don't like the thought of camp.

10:22.172 --> 10:22.827
Without joe.

10:22.862 --> 10:24.827
I think I'll be miserable.

10:24.862 --> 10:27.793
Joe is allowing us to win all
These challenges so we don't.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.586
Have to go to tribal.

10:29.620 --> 10:33.379
If we are without joe, we're
Probably going to lose them.

10:33.413 --> 10:35.896
We can survive without him.

10:35.931 --> 10:41.034
We can't let him keep making a
Case of why he should win if.

10:41.068 --> 10:41.482
He's done everything.

10:41.517 --> 10:42.448
True.

10:42.482 --> 10:46.103
Joe cannot go too far in this
Game.

10:46.137 --> 10:48.034
That's a no-brainer.

10:48.068 --> 10:51.068
And I'm very concerned that the
Four returning players are all.

10:51.103 --> 10:52.862
Still in the game.

10:52.896 --> 10:56.068
Come merge, he's going to be
So hard to get out of this game.

10:56.103 --> 10:58.689
But when he doesn't see it
Coming...

10:58.724 --> 11:02.379
If you don't get rid of
Returning players, by the time.

11:02.413 --> 11:07.068
The merge hits, they could run
Away with the whole thing, so if.

11:07.103 --> 11:15.068
We were to lose immunity, joe
Has to go now.

11:15.103 --> 11:18.137
So p.B. And j. Powers Activate.

11:18.172 --> 11:21.344
Cheers.

11:21.379 --> 11:22.551
Ready?

11:22.586 --> 11:26.827
Peanut butter and jelly, it's
Like a flavor change, some.

11:26.862 --> 11:27.758
Protein.

11:27.793 --> 11:30.551
It's pretty good, but I'm so
Hungry today.

11:30.586 --> 11:36.034
Today is first day I'm like real
Hungry.

11:36.068 --> 11:37.206
Yeah.

11:37.241 --> 11:40.310
I feel like if we can't fish,
We should eat a chicken.

11:40.344 --> 11:48.344
If I see one, I'll grab one.

11:49.586 --> 11:52.137
Wendy doesn't want us to eat the
Chickens.

11:52.172 --> 11:52.862
So they're free range.

11:52.896 --> 11:54.000
They're part of the island.

11:54.034 --> 11:56.275
As long as they don't end up
Dead.

11:56.310 --> 11:59.517
I feel like working with
Wendy would be more like.

11:59.551 --> 12:02.206
Carrying around an alarm clock,
But you have no clue when it's.

12:02.241 --> 12:06.103
Going to go off, but there is an
Issue of the returners.

12:06.137 --> 12:09.206
The longer they're in the game,
The more dangerous it gets.

12:09.241 --> 12:12.241
So like all things in this game,
It's a balancing act.

12:12.275 --> 12:15.724
Like they're gone and they're
Out there and it bothers me that.

12:15.758 --> 12:17.862
They're out there.

12:17.896 --> 12:21.241
We're in the "Survivor" waiting
Room right now on the manu.

12:21.275 --> 12:21.931
Tribe.

12:21.965 --> 12:23.379
We haven't gone to tribal yet.

12:23.413 --> 12:26.068
Nothing has happened, and we're
Talking about chickens.

12:26.103 --> 12:29.310
It's so frustrating.

12:29.344 --> 12:37.344
Like "Survivor," there are many
Ghosts in the jungle in fiji.

12:39.413 --> 12:40.689
I am dying to play.

12:40.724 --> 12:42.310
I came in aggressive.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.068
I found my idol.

12:44.103 --> 12:45.965
And I kind of simmered down.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.862
Now we got to heat the dish back
Up, so what I'm trying to do is.

12:50.896 --> 12:54.172
Figure out who the strategists
Are and find myself one that is.

12:54.206 --> 13:00.241
Going to be able to wake up from
The kama kool-aid and do.

13:00.275 --> 13:06.206
Something about everything come
The merge.

13:06.241 --> 13:10.206
Would you rather go into the
Merge with aubry or with wendy?

13:10.241 --> 13:13.965
I think I'd rather go with
Wendy just because she's less of.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.482
A strategic threat.

13:17.517 --> 13:21.413
What if I went to aubry and
Said, do you want to do a girl's.

13:21.448 --> 13:24.620
Thing, so if she does have an
Idol, she would literally never.

13:24.655 --> 13:25.724
Play her idol.

13:25.758 --> 13:28.655
It would make me believe more
I'm not with you guys.

13:28.689 --> 13:31.793
It feels like the safest way to
Placate and.

13:31.827 --> 13:34.172
And then she would feel more
Comfortable.

13:34.206 --> 13:36.068
I think it would be a good
Diversion.

13:36.103 --> 13:40.482
I think we tell wendy, say,
Let's just tell her...

13:40.517 --> 13:43.620
I think it's in our best
Interest to get rid of aubry.

13:43.655 --> 13:45.655
First when she doesn't see it
Coming.

13:45.689 --> 13:50.275
As a person, I really like
Aubry, but for me, it might.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.310
Sound bo bad, but I have no
Problem separating friendships.

13:53.344 --> 13:54.655
From the game.

13:54.689 --> 13:58.551
Like I don't really care about
How people feel out here, but.

13:58.586 --> 14:02.344
Now I have to keep aubry
Thinking that I'm on her side.

14:02.379 --> 14:06.482
Like I have no clue what jeff
Has in store, and everybody here.

14:06.517 --> 14:10.275
Is like, I don't know unless I'm
Missing something major, people.

14:10.310 --> 14:11.551
Are really calm, which is good.

14:11.586 --> 14:14.689
Yeah, I think everyone is
Calm, because we have our buffer.

14:14.724 --> 14:15.000
Vote.

14:15.034 --> 14:16.172
Yeah.

14:16.206 --> 14:19.172
I think so for sure.ÑI
But you have seen "Survivor."

14:19.206 --> 14:21.068
You know it's like...

14:21.103 --> 14:22.493
nothing is going to be this
Easy.

14:22.517 --> 14:23.862
It's going to get weird.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.793
I just wanted to see where your
Head was at.

14:25.827 --> 14:29.551
Would it make sense while we
Still have wendy, to do.

14:29.586 --> 14:34.275
Something with wendy, me and
You, me you and wendy.

14:34.310 --> 14:35.517
We could.

14:35.551 --> 14:40.275
Because if we get rid of like
An eric in the next vote and

14:40.310 --> 14:41.517
Gavin after that.

14:41.551 --> 14:44.724
Victoria said, we have to go
After the big boys sooner or.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.379
Later, and I was psyched to hear
Her say that.

14:47.413 --> 14:50.827
I think you're the only one I
Trust even a little bit right.

14:50.862 --> 14:52.206
Now.

14:52.241 --> 14:55.379
Vick was just under my nose.

14:55.413 --> 14:57.034
She's been sneaky the whole
Time.

14:57.068 --> 14:58.620
Those glasses may be big.

14:58.655 --> 15:03.137
Maybe I didn't see her eyes
Open.

15:03.172 --> 15:05.379
We're the misfits that Couldn't.

15:05.413 --> 15:10.689
Obviously the tribe is in
Need of a serious pick-me-up.

15:10.724 --> 15:13.310
I was thinking if you and I want
To try to go fishing.

15:13.344 --> 15:17.862
I've never fished before in
My life.

15:17.896 --> 15:20.896
Honestly, I'm half full of rice.

15:20.931 --> 15:21.862
I have no calories.

15:21.896 --> 15:22.551
Okay.

15:22.586 --> 15:23.793
That's fair.

15:23.827 --> 15:27.965
This tribe is so on the edge of
Distinction that scientists.

15:28.000 --> 15:28.655
Stopped looking for us.

15:28.689 --> 15:30.241
They already think we're dead.

15:30.275 --> 15:34.344
We're like the last four dodo
Birds living on a remote island,

15:34.379 --> 15:37.241
And I think I'm next should we
Lose the next immunity.

15:37.275 --> 15:37.896
Challenge.

15:37.931 --> 15:40.379
I'll try to find snails.

15:40.413 --> 15:45.103
If I know my "Survivor" history
At all, there is absolutely a.

15:45.137 --> 15:46.665
Hidden immunity idol on the new
Lesu tribe.

15:46.689 --> 15:47.586
Finding it is critical.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.965
It's so frustrating.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.275
Because I need it bad.

15:55.310 --> 15:58.655
I look around at all my peers
Back home, and they're married.

15:58.689 --> 16:01.862
And they have kids.

16:01.896 --> 16:05.000
And it's something that kind of
Escaped me for years.

16:05.034 --> 16:06.275
I'm 44 years old.

16:06.310 --> 16:11.931
All I have is a two-bedroom
Apartment and some d.V.D.S on.

16:11.965 --> 16:12.551
A shelf.

16:12.586 --> 16:14.000
But I need to shake that.

16:14.034 --> 16:16.827
I need to shake that in my life
And I need to shake that in this.

16:16.862 --> 16:18.000
Game.

16:18.034 --> 16:19.424
It wasn't until I played
"Survivor" the first time that I.

16:19.448 --> 16:23.000
Think I really started to get up
Off the couch and start living.

16:23.034 --> 16:24.241
My life again.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.793
It's time to build on that and
Move forward rather than just.

16:27.827 --> 16:30.034
Stay in this one spot.

16:30.068 --> 16:33.068
So I absolutely want the find
The hidden immunity idol.

16:33.103 --> 16:35.103
I keep looking and I keep coming
Up short.

16:35.137 --> 16:43.137
But I will never give up in this
Game.

16:44.931 --> 16:51.137
He's the biggest problem in
Every challenge.

16:51.172 --> 16:52.862
He can't go off by himself.

16:52.896 --> 16:54.137
We can't trust him.

16:54.172 --> 16:56.793
I have been so sick.

16:56.827 --> 16:58.206
Luckily wardog is on my side.

16:58.241 --> 16:59.586
Kelley is on my side.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.689
And I have an idol from the
Original manu.

17:02.724 --> 17:08.344
So if we go to another tribal,
It's going to be david.

17:08.378 --> 17:09.068
Okay.

17:09.103 --> 17:10.034
Here's what I'm thinking.

17:10.068 --> 17:11.241
Okay.

17:11.275 --> 17:15.000
I think that me and you make
The best combo post-merge.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.241
I really do.

17:16.275 --> 17:17.896
One major concern is a david
Idol.

17:17.931 --> 17:18.517
Yes.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.517
Okay.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.172
The second major concern is in
The become of my mind, if it's.

17:23.205 --> 17:26.310
Me, you, and lauren, I'm
Thinking that lauren and you.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.103
Might take me out.

17:28.137 --> 17:30.724
And you're thinking lauren and
Me might take you out.

17:30.758 --> 17:31.620
Lauren just hurts us.

17:31.655 --> 17:34.068
I think me and you vote lauren
Out now.

17:34.103 --> 17:35.689
Wardog is a crazy man.

17:35.724 --> 17:41.034
I think he has a little tony in
Him, but if we do lose, that.

17:41.068 --> 17:43.551
Seems to be a trend on this
Tribe, it's always important to.

17:43.586 --> 17:48.068
Have an a, b, and c plan.

17:48.103 --> 17:51.034
I do have a great relationship
With lauren and I want to work.

17:51.068 --> 17:54.655
With her, but I feel like wardog
Has been truthful with me so.

17:54.689 --> 17:55.862
Far.

17:55.896 --> 17:58.310
He's been the one who comes to
Me with ideas, and desperate.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.896
Times call for desperate
Measures.

17:59.931 --> 18:03.206
So I have to figure out a game
Plan that's going to work for me.

18:03.241 --> 18:04.275
Moving forward.

18:04.310 --> 18:08.206
We take her out.
You're an evil mastermind.

18:08.241 --> 18:11.241
It's "Survivor," and it's kill
Or be killed.

18:27.068 --> 18:33.827
There's something here.

18:33.862 --> 18:38.034
This is the most exciting thing
That's happened in the last five.

18:38.068 --> 18:38.586
Days.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.000
What the heck is this?

18:40.034 --> 18:42.965
We have news.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.896
Wake up, wake up!

18:44.931 --> 18:46.241
We have information.

18:46.275 --> 18:48.413
We have news.

18:48.448 --> 18:49.689
All right.

18:49.724 --> 18:52.724
I'm going to collect wood, and I
Find this box.

18:52.758 --> 18:53.586
My god.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.310
And it's got something for each
Of us.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.241
Finally.

18:56.275 --> 18:57.689
Hallelujah.

18:57.724 --> 19:00.758
On the edge of extinction,
You have literally nothing some.

19:00.793 --> 19:05.000
As soon as chris came around the
Corner with that box, er knew.

19:05.034 --> 19:05.965
I freaked.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.965
This is something new, some more
Information.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.931
I was like some way or somehow
Something is going the happen in.

19:10.965 --> 19:11.758
My favor.

19:11.793 --> 19:12.907
You're on the edge of
Extinction.

19:12.931 --> 19:15.448
Your goal is to get back in the
Fold.

19:15.482 --> 19:19.103
If the stars align, they'll
Point the way.

19:19.137 --> 19:21.620
Your goal is to get back in
The fold.

19:21.655 --> 19:24.413
If the stars align, they'll
Point the way.

19:24.448 --> 19:25.655
Back in the fold.

19:25.689 --> 19:29.000
Are we supposed to fold it so
The stars align?

19:29.034 --> 19:30.241
Where are stars?

19:30.275 --> 19:31.206
On the border?

19:31.241 --> 19:33.586
I figured the map out really
Quick.

19:33.620 --> 19:36.827
The stars on the border match up
With each other.

19:36.862 --> 19:41.379
And you can see that it makes
The arrow point right to this.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.931
Tree with no leaves.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.689
Then on the other side, this
Arrow points right to this tree.

19:46.724 --> 19:48.413
With lots of different roots.

19:48.448 --> 19:52.413
So it might be my proudest
Moment on "Survivor" so far.

19:52.448 --> 19:53.620
It's pointing to the tree.

19:53.655 --> 19:56.689
We're going to have to have a
Pact we go all together.

19:56.724 --> 19:57.068
Am I right?

19:57.103 --> 19:57.931
I agree.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.586
You want to have rice first?

19:59.620 --> 20:01.931
We might as well.

20:01.965 --> 20:02.586
That's not to.

20:02.620 --> 20:03.862
Rick figured out the map.

20:03.896 --> 20:06.896
To be honest, I was not going to
Figure out that map.

20:06.931 --> 20:09.586
That whole folding the thing
Together, that never would have.

20:09.620 --> 20:10.068
Happened.

20:10.103 --> 20:10.758
This is tasty.

20:10.793 --> 20:11.965
This is good.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.758
This spoon is half broken,
But it's like my own little.

20:15.793 --> 20:16.482
Left-handed spoon.

20:16.517 --> 20:17.965
Thank you for the rice, reem.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.413
It's good to have a mom on
Your tribe.

20:20.448 --> 20:22.931
Everybody said we're going to
Go fair and square.

20:22.965 --> 20:23.931
I was like, what?

20:23.965 --> 20:25.827
I was like, that's not going to
Happen.

20:25.862 --> 20:28.344
Where is keith?

20:28.379 --> 20:29.034
Where is he?

20:29.068 --> 20:30.793
Did he have his shoes on.

20:30.827 --> 20:35.344
Keith, get back here.

20:35.379 --> 20:35.689
Keith?

20:35.724 --> 20:37.655
Keith!

20:37.689 --> 20:42.275
Go down there and see if he's
Walking down there.

20:42.310 --> 20:43.344
Is he going?

20:43.379 --> 20:44.068
Yeah.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.172
He's way down there.

20:45.206 --> 20:45.620
My god.

20:45.655 --> 20:46.620
Did he go?

20:46.655 --> 20:47.758
Yes, he went.

20:47.793 --> 20:48.965
Keith, you jerk.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.344
Darn it, that is so... you
Know what, that is.

20:52.379 --> 20:53.137
Disappointing, dude.

20:53.172 --> 20:54.000
Shoes on.

20:54.034 --> 21:02.034
Wow, keith, what an... hurry up.

21:02.724 --> 21:03.655
You guys have the map?

21:03.689 --> 21:04.379
Yes.

21:04.413 --> 21:06.034
We're coming for you, keith.

21:06.068 --> 21:11.172
What a guy.

21:11.206 --> 21:13.931
The path is going to split,
Just so you know.

21:13.965 --> 21:18.344
This is exactly why we voted
Him out.

21:18.379 --> 21:19.827
Keith!

21:19.862 --> 21:21.034
I got to find it.

21:21.068 --> 21:22.137
I got to find it.

21:22.172 --> 21:24.620
Come on, god, come on, god, come
On, god.

21:24.655 --> 21:25.724
Is he there?

21:25.758 --> 21:28.000
What the hell, keith?

21:28.034 --> 21:29.758
This is for family.

21:29.793 --> 21:30.724
It's not for chris.

21:30.758 --> 21:32.586
It's not for reem.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.068
Keith, you dog.

21:35.103 --> 21:40.758
You got him.

21:40.793 --> 21:42.241
Not cool.

21:42.275 --> 21:43.413
You got it, chris?

21:43.448 --> 21:46.517
Yes.

21:46.551 --> 21:47.862
I look in the tree.

21:47.896 --> 21:50.517
I pull out three bamboo rods.

21:50.551 --> 21:53.000
There's string attached to these
Rods.

21:53.034 --> 21:55.931
And there's a note.

21:55.965 --> 21:57.413
Practice.

21:57.448 --> 21:58.827
It says practice on it.

21:58.862 --> 22:01.793
This is the first exciting clue
To what we're going to be doing.

22:01.827 --> 22:03.068
Next.

22:03.103 --> 22:05.724
My guess, it's got to be
Something you practice with to.

22:05.758 --> 22:09.241
Get back into the game.

22:09.275 --> 22:10.482
My move is to be that person.

22:10.517 --> 22:14.103
Rick, why did I fold that map
Right in front of everybody?

22:14.137 --> 22:16.413
Chris, you will wait for me,
Right?

22:16.448 --> 22:16.931
Yes.

22:16.965 --> 22:17.620
I got it.

22:17.655 --> 22:19.172
Chris ran to one tree.

22:19.206 --> 22:19.965
I ran to the other.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.586
We had the advantages in our
Hands.

22:21.620 --> 22:25.034
You have earned the right to
Give this extra vote to any.

22:25.068 --> 22:27.448
Player heading not next tribal
Council.

22:27.482 --> 22:29.413
They will not know it is from
You.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.689
Choose wisely.

22:30.724 --> 22:35.000
So I found an advantage they
Can give one person heading to.

22:35.034 --> 22:36.689
Tribal council an extra vote.

22:36.724 --> 22:39.896
Whoever gets this vote, they
Have no idea the edge of.

22:39.931 --> 22:40.827
Extinction exists.

22:40.862 --> 22:42.724
That's pretty good for
Whoever gets it.

22:42.758 --> 22:45.896
It was a wake-up call that
We're on the edge of extinction,

22:45.931 --> 22:50.931
But we're not out of the game,
So I'm playing out here now.

23:03.241 --> 23:04.310
All right.

23:04.344 --> 23:07.068
You guys ready to get to today's
Immunity challenge?

23:07.103 --> 23:08.241
Yeah.

23:08.275 --> 23:11.068
First things first, I
Got to take back the idol.

23:11.655 --> 23:12.448
Sorry.

23:12.482 --> 23:13.896
You have to give it up.

23:13.931 --> 23:17.793
It's part of the game.

23:17.827 --> 23:20.206
Once again immunity is back up
For grabs.

23:20.241 --> 23:23.931
For today's challenge, you're
Going to swim out to a ramp,

23:23.965 --> 23:25.275
Race up, and leap off.

23:25.310 --> 23:31.655
You'll then dive down to
Retrieve a puzzle piece.

23:31.689 --> 23:35.586
Once you have all your pieces,
You'll pull your pontoon to the.

23:35.620 --> 23:41.275
Finish and use those pieces to
Build a back to buoy pyramid.

23:41.310 --> 23:46.206
First two tribes to finish win
Immunity.

23:46.241 --> 23:48.793
Losers, tribal council, where
Somebody will be voted out of.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.517
This game.

23:50.551 --> 23:51.862
Sitout, kama, one extra person.

23:51.896 --> 23:53.000
I'm going to sit out.

23:53.034 --> 23:54.241
Julie will sit out For kama.

23:54.275 --> 23:54.517
Manu?

23:54.551 --> 23:55.793
Me.

23:55.827 --> 23:57.931
Victoria will sit out For manu.

23:57.965 --> 23:59.862
Everybody else take your spots.

23:59.896 --> 24:07.896
We'll get started.

24:13.448 --> 24:14.310
All right.

24:14.344 --> 24:17.034
For immunity, survivors ready?

24:17.068 --> 24:18.896
Go!

24:18.931 --> 24:21.620
It is eric first in for manu.

24:21.655 --> 24:24.586
Come on, kel.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.379
Aurora first in for kama.

24:27.413 --> 24:29.034
Come on, kelley, come on.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.413
Nice and easy.

24:30.448 --> 24:32.206
Breathe.

24:32.241 --> 24:37.206
Wentworth first in For lesu.

24:37.241 --> 24:45.241
Now you got to dive down and
Release that first puzzle piece.

24:47.827 --> 24:49.034
Eric has it for manu.

24:49.068 --> 24:53.413
Got to get up on that pontoon
With your piece.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.448
Wentworth now trying to get that
Mask on.

24:55.482 --> 24:57.482
Come on, kelley, come On.

24:57.517 --> 24:59.758
You got this, kelley!

24:59.793 --> 25:00.517
Go, manu.

25:00.551 --> 25:06.206
Now aubry in the water for manu.

25:06.241 --> 25:07.517
Aurora cannot get the buoy.

25:07.551 --> 25:11.275
This is going to be a setback
For kama.

25:11.310 --> 25:18.137
Joe now inñl the water.

25:18.172 --> 25:20.551
Aubry can't get it for manu.

25:20.586 --> 25:21.620
Here goes gavin.

25:21.655 --> 25:25.551
He's going to give it a go now.

25:25.586 --> 25:27.172
Wentworth still working.

25:27.206 --> 25:28.241
She can't get it.

25:28.275 --> 25:31.862
You got to get down there.

25:31.896 --> 25:33.379
Joe has it for kama.

25:33.413 --> 25:37.448
They have one of their two
Pieces.

25:37.482 --> 25:38.517
Go, kama.

25:38.551 --> 25:45.482
It's going to be julie in the
Water now for kama.

25:45.517 --> 25:46.562
Wentworth still struggling.

25:46.586 --> 25:47.724
Going to give up.

25:47.758 --> 25:50.482
Wentworth got to get on that
Pontoon.

25:50.517 --> 25:55.068
Wentworth exhausted and came up
Empty handed.

25:55.103 --> 25:56.137
Go, lesu!

25:56.172 --> 25:59.586
It's going to be lauren in the
Water now for lesu.

25:59.620 --> 26:02.310
Gavin has the second puzzle
Piece for manu.

26:02.344 --> 26:04.448
Manu has their two puzzle
Pieces.

26:04.482 --> 26:06.448
Wendy just has to get to the
Pontoon now.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.793
Big lead for manu.

26:09.827 --> 26:13.137
Julia releases the second piece
For kama.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.000
Kama now has both their pieces.

26:15.034 --> 26:17.000
She's got to get back.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.758
You're good, manu.

26:18.793 --> 26:21.034
Unclip and start pulling your
Pontoon.

26:21.068 --> 26:24.482
Go!

26:24.517 --> 26:26.551
Kama has both puzzle pieces.

26:26.586 --> 26:31.448
Ron just has to get himself to
The pontoon.

26:31.482 --> 26:33.793
Lesu in dead last once again.

26:33.827 --> 26:36.137
They are empty handed.

26:36.172 --> 26:39.344
Both of their tribes have both
Puzzle pieces.

26:39.379 --> 26:42.275
Ron back to the pontoon for
Kama.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.724
Start pulling.

26:44.758 --> 26:47.620
Manu now can start working on
Their pyramid.

26:47.655 --> 26:51.241
It's a huge time advantage over
Lesu.

26:51.275 --> 26:52.482
Here comes kama.

26:52.517 --> 26:56.000
This is the kind of puzzle you
Could solve very fast as there.

26:56.034 --> 26:57.862
Are only four pieces.

26:57.896 --> 26:58.896
But it will fool you.

26:58.931 --> 27:00.448
We can't do it that way.

27:00.482 --> 27:03.827
Manu and kama
Fighting for immunity and the.

27:03.862 --> 27:06.896
Advantage they have is two
Tribes will win immunity, and.

27:06.931 --> 27:13.379
Right now one tribe is doing
Nothing.

27:13.413 --> 27:14.586
Lauren now going to give up.

27:14.620 --> 27:15.896
She's heading back.

27:15.931 --> 27:21.344
This might be one of the biggest
Blowouts in "Survivor" history.

27:21.379 --> 27:26.310
Once again lesu with lauren,
Wentworth, wardog and david have.

27:26.344 --> 27:28.103
Been through every single
Tribal.

27:28.137 --> 27:31.482
Right now that appears to be a
Streak that will remain intact.

27:31.517 --> 27:36.068
As they have none of their
Puzzle pieces while both other.

27:36.103 --> 27:39.241
Tribes are already solving.

27:39.275 --> 27:40.206
Right there.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.310
See that?

27:41.344 --> 27:44.344
There's only four
Pieces, but it can be very.

27:44.379 --> 27:45.551
Difficult.

27:45.586 --> 27:53.586
Until you figure it out, and
Then it will solve instantly.

27:55.034 --> 27:56.689
Wardog can't get it either.

27:56.724 --> 28:01.517
Wentworth in despair once again.

28:01.551 --> 28:05.965
She sees the challenge slipping
Away.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.034
Wardog pops the first puzzle
Piece for lesu.

28:08.068 --> 28:10.689
There is life for lesu after
All.

28:10.724 --> 28:12.586
David, you can do it!

28:12.620 --> 28:14.413
Now david in the Water.

28:14.448 --> 28:17.034
A chance for david to shine in
An environment he really.

28:17.068 --> 28:19.172
Struggles in, the ocean.

28:19.206 --> 28:20.517
Come on, david.

28:20.551 --> 28:23.551
David's got to get
Down and release it, david.

28:23.586 --> 28:27.068
Let's go!

28:27.103 --> 28:31.551
The good news is manu and kama
Have not solved the puzzle, so.

28:31.586 --> 28:38.137
That door is still technically
Open for lesu.

28:38.172 --> 28:40.000
David, come on.

28:40.034 --> 28:41.758
Come to the pontoon, I'm going
To go.

28:41.793 --> 28:45.068
David going to give
Up and swim back to the pontoon.

28:45.103 --> 28:47.310
Somebody from that four will
Have to go back.

28:47.344 --> 28:49.172
Lesu is not a tribe that's
Quick.

28:49.206 --> 28:51.620
They're just a tribe having a
Very tough time winning.

28:51.655 --> 28:52.793
Get out of the water.

28:52.827 --> 28:56.448
Lauren goes back down
Yet again for another try.

28:56.482 --> 28:58.000
Is this the one?

28:58.034 --> 28:59.620
I'm going to get it.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.310
I'm going to get it.

29:00.344 --> 29:01.551
I believe in you.

29:01.586 --> 29:05.724
You got this.

29:05.758 --> 29:06.379
Yes!

29:06.413 --> 29:08.448
And she does it.

29:08.482 --> 29:11.068
Lauren frees that second piece
For lesu.

29:11.103 --> 29:12.655
Tell me when you're ready.

29:12.689 --> 29:13.896
Unclip.

29:13.931 --> 29:14.551
Start pulling.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.000
Here comes lesu now.

29:17.034 --> 29:18.137
We got a challenge.

29:18.172 --> 29:19.482
Pull, guys, pull.

29:19.517 --> 29:22.620
Manu and kama have
Had a long time to experiment on.

29:22.655 --> 29:24.034
This puzzle.

29:24.068 --> 29:25.448
But it has resulted in nothing.

29:25.482 --> 29:27.275
I hate puzzles.

29:27.310 --> 29:30.034
If lesu could pull
This challenge out, it would be.

29:30.068 --> 29:35.758
One of the greatest comebacks in
The history of "Survivor".

29:35.793 --> 29:38.310
Let's go, lesu!

29:38.344 --> 29:41.965
Victory here would be a major
Win.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.034
This one.

29:43.068 --> 29:43.448
No.

29:43.482 --> 29:43.965
Okay.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.827
No.

29:47.862 --> 29:48.620
Yes.

29:48.655 --> 29:51.206
Kama thinks they have It.

29:51.241 --> 29:52.896
Pull that up.

29:52.931 --> 29:53.586
And that do.

29:53.620 --> 29:54.586
Joe is right.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.758
Kama wins immunity once again.

29:56.793 --> 30:02.103
We're looking for one more.

30:02.137 --> 30:03.482
Four on the bottom.

30:03.517 --> 30:04.275
Quick, quick.

30:04.310 --> 30:05.413
Manu is amped up.

30:05.448 --> 30:07.344
Guys, we're so close, guys.

30:07.379 --> 30:08.241
Yeah, yeah.

30:08.275 --> 30:10.689
Who is going to get There first?

30:10.724 --> 30:12.103
Will it be manu or lesu?

30:12.137 --> 30:13.724
This is going to go here.

30:13.758 --> 30:15.413
This is going to go right here.

30:15.448 --> 30:15.896
Right there.

30:15.931 --> 30:16.724
Is that it?

30:16.758 --> 30:17.827
That might be it.

30:17.862 --> 30:18.758
Put that there.

30:18.793 --> 30:20.620
Put that there.

30:20.655 --> 30:22.068
David trying something
Different.

30:22.103 --> 30:23.034
Lesu thinks they have it.

30:23.068 --> 30:25.344
If they have it, it would be
Their first win.

30:25.379 --> 30:26.862
And it is!

30:26.896 --> 30:32.034
Lesu wins immunity sending manu
To tribal council.

30:32.068 --> 30:33.000
Yes!

30:33.034 --> 30:33.655
Yes!

30:33.689 --> 30:35.586
My god.

30:35.620 --> 30:37.379
My god, guys.

30:37.413 --> 30:38.689
My god.

30:38.724 --> 30:39.413
Guys, guys.

30:39.448 --> 30:40.413
My god.

30:40.448 --> 30:41.034
My god.

30:41.068 --> 30:42.586
Are you okay?

30:42.620 --> 30:44.586
My god.

30:44.620 --> 30:48.482
My god, my god.

30:48.517 --> 30:51.000
Kama, a familiar Story.

30:51.034 --> 30:53.448
Once again immunity is yours.

30:53.482 --> 30:54.482
Thank you, jeff.

30:54.517 --> 30:55.620
Swim out.

30:55.655 --> 31:02.413
Enjoy the night off.

31:02.448 --> 31:07.172
Lesu, your first immunity win.

31:07.206 --> 31:11.310
For the first time this season
David, lauren, wentworth,

31:11.344 --> 31:15.275
Wardog, I will not be seeing you
At tribal council.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.172
Swim out.

31:16.206 --> 31:24.206
Enjoy the celebration and the
Night off.

31:25.448 --> 31:28.655
Manu, somebody going home
Tonight.

31:28.689 --> 31:29.448
Swim out.

31:29.482 --> 31:30.631
See you tonight at tribal
Council.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.793
Right now we do have a common
Goal.

31:32.827 --> 31:34.241
We all think aubry needs to go.

31:34.275 --> 31:37.517
But I still think we are making
A big move, and big moves are.

31:37.551 --> 31:38.827
Always risky.

31:38.862 --> 31:42.862
So I'm going to pick and choose
My words carefully to not overor.

31:42.896 --> 31:46.896
Under expose what's really
Happening.

32:01.931 --> 32:04.689
Sorry we couldn't pull it
Out, guys.

32:04.724 --> 32:05.724
Man.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.000
Going to tribal, I know the
Drill.

32:08.034 --> 32:12.241
It was almost surreal coming
Back from losing the challenge,

32:12.275 --> 32:17.068
Because the four original kama
Came together, and it just.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.689
Seemed so easy.

32:18.724 --> 32:21.689
Right now we need this four
To go further.

32:21.724 --> 32:22.827
I know.

32:22.862 --> 32:27.896
Like we need this to further
Ourselves in the game.

32:27.931 --> 32:30.310
We're going to forge this Four.

32:30.344 --> 32:31.241
Perfect.

32:31.275 --> 32:33.000
Plan is to voted out wendy.

32:33.034 --> 32:37.000
But I was talking to victoria
Yesterday, and she said do we go.

32:37.034 --> 32:39.379
For one of the big guys right
Now?

32:39.413 --> 32:42.827
I can tell you want to do
Something.

32:42.862 --> 32:44.827
Don't want to miss the Moment.

32:44.862 --> 32:47.000
No.

32:47.034 --> 32:48.482
I'm 1,000% down with you.

32:48.517 --> 32:51.206
The advantage to doing it now
Is we have numbers.

32:51.241 --> 32:54.241
I think wendy would do
Anything to save herself, you.

32:54.275 --> 32:54.931
Know what I mean?

32:54.965 --> 32:56.172
Yeah, I know.

32:56.206 --> 33:01.379
Having wendy right now is an
Opportunity to do something.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.827
There are three girl, two guys,.

33:03.862 --> 33:05.551
I know vick andry good right
Now.

33:05.586 --> 33:10.310
We could kill eric off Tonight.

33:10.344 --> 33:13.206
I'd like to make a move.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.206
You've seen me play.

33:16.241 --> 33:18.448
That has been running through my
Mind for days.

33:18.482 --> 33:19.655
It's all timing.

33:19.689 --> 33:21.631
We do that now we could be
Shooting ourselves in the foot.

33:21.655 --> 33:24.586
We weighed the pros and cons Do.

33:24.620 --> 33:29.310
We work with wendy and take out
An eric or a gavin.

33:29.344 --> 33:31.068
Eric is going to be a threat at
The merge.

33:31.103 --> 33:34.620
We might not be able to get him
Out physically.

33:34.655 --> 33:37.586
Do we take our hit while we have
Wendy.

33:37.620 --> 33:39.931
What kind of game did you come
In hoping to play?

33:39.965 --> 33:42.000
What kind of people do you want
To play with?

33:42.034 --> 33:43.172
Play with?

33:43.206 --> 33:50.793
Yeah, like, I mean, we could
Go for one of the boys.

33:50.827 --> 33:55.034
If that's something you're
Interested in.

33:55.068 --> 33:59.310
Like if you guys say, yeah,
And I say new york it's not.

33:59.344 --> 34:01.034
Like...
we wanted to do something.

34:01.068 --> 34:03.068
Like that, it would be now.

34:03.103 --> 34:10.655
Because there's three of us,
Right?

34:10.688 --> 34:12.757
We have the think on it.

34:12.793 --> 34:15.275
Wendy can't make a decision.

34:15.310 --> 34:19.137
It is incredibly difficult to
Get even an opinion out of her.

34:19.172 --> 34:24.241
And if you can't give an opinion
When you're neck is on the line.

34:24.275 --> 34:27.655
And it's four original tribe
Mates against you, I don't know.

34:27.688 --> 34:34.620
How I can work with you for the
Rest of the game.

34:34.655 --> 34:38.655
The decision for me is a big
Decision, because it is forging.

34:38.688 --> 34:41.137
An alliance for me, but nobody
Has seen any game yet.

34:41.172 --> 34:43.034
We're good?

34:43.068 --> 34:46.172
I don't know who these people
Are as players some the idol is.

34:46.206 --> 34:49.827
Always factor for me, and I'm
Walking around with my bag,

34:49.862 --> 34:54.206
Making sure I got a good little
Spot for my hidden immunity idol.

34:54.241 --> 35:02.241
To nestle before going to
Tribal, and there's an envelope.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.758
Someone has sent you the
Advantage in the form of a.

35:07.793 --> 35:09.000
Secret extra vote.

35:09.034 --> 35:13.620
When it's time to vote, use the
Parchment to cast the second.

35:13.655 --> 35:14.793
Vote.

35:14.827 --> 35:18.310
If you're clever, nobody else
Will know you voted twice.

35:18.344 --> 35:21.896
The last time this vote can be
Used when there are seven people.

35:21.931 --> 35:22.862
Left in the game.

35:22.896 --> 35:28.379
The extra vote extends to a tie
And revote.

35:28.413 --> 35:29.620
My gosh.

35:29.655 --> 35:33.137
Someone in the game is looking
Out for me, and I want to know.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.689
Who it is.

35:34.724 --> 35:36.862
Because that's someone who is on
My side.

35:36.896 --> 35:38.517
This extra vote changes
Everything.

35:38.551 --> 35:42.172
I mean, do I use it now and
Knock out eric?

35:42.206 --> 35:47.931
Or do I save it post-merge and
Use it when the numbers get.

35:47.965 --> 35:49.827
Funky?

35:49.862 --> 35:54.000
It's about to get real.

35:54.034 --> 35:56.275
I'm not good with power Stuff.

35:56.310 --> 35:57.931
I'm used to playing from behind.

35:57.965 --> 36:00.896
I don't know how to play when I
Have cards in my hand.

36:00.931 --> 36:03.448
When I have the royal flush, I
Don't know what the hell to do.

36:03.482 --> 36:05.965
I have alliances starting.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.448
I feel good with vick, but I
Almost don't know what to do.

36:10.482 --> 36:13.827
When something somewhat positive
Happens in this game.

36:13.862 --> 36:17.344
Like I have choices to make with
Big things, and I feel like that.

36:17.379 --> 36:20.310
Means I'm going to be voted out
Tonight.

36:20.344 --> 36:24.068
But maybe that's not the
Mentality to have.

36:24.103 --> 36:28.034
Every time I try to do something
In "Survivor," something goes.

36:28.068 --> 36:30.965
Wrong, like maybe I have to have
A little faith that maybe just a.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
Little bitty thing can go right.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.931
If you don't yet have
A torch, grab one we hide you,

37:04.965 --> 37:12.965
Dip it in, and get fire.

37:13.068 --> 37:15.827
Part of the ritual at tribal
Council, because in this game,

37:15.862 --> 37:18.517
Fire represents your life.

37:18.551 --> 37:23.793
And when your fire is gone, so
Are you.

37:23.827 --> 37:27.413
So, dwaffen, you can often get
Scenes of how tribal will go.

37:27.448 --> 37:30.758
Based on the mood of the tribe
Right after you get back to camp.

37:30.793 --> 37:32.689
From losing a challenge.

37:32.724 --> 37:35.068
What happened when you guys got
Back?

37:35.103 --> 37:38.724
The mood was pretty dang
Relaxed whenever we got back.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.034
So I'm curious to see what
Tonight holds.

37:41.068 --> 37:43.206
Aubry, does that mean
Nobody talked?

37:43.241 --> 37:44.734
Everybody just knew what was
Going to happen?

37:44.758 --> 37:46.413
Absolutely not, jeff.

37:46.448 --> 37:49.896
Everyone is always talking inch
This game you have to be a talk.

37:49.931 --> 37:52.103
Ahead, otherwise you're out
Before you even realize.

37:52.137 --> 37:55.344
Victoria, aubry says,
Yeah, there was talking.

37:55.379 --> 37:57.379
Aubry's absolutely right.

37:57.413 --> 37:59.724
There were definitely
Conversations that I was in.

37:59.758 --> 38:03.655
I'm just hoping that everyone
Didn't get into their own heads.

38:03.689 --> 38:07.241
So wendy, you're an
Obvious consideration tonight.

38:07.275 --> 38:10.275
For the simple reason that these
Four have been together from the.

38:10.310 --> 38:10.586
Beginning.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.206
Yes.

38:12.241 --> 38:13.068
1,000%.

38:13.103 --> 38:15.275
And yet you're still Smiling.

38:15.310 --> 38:18.448
I feel like people are more
Confused than anything about my.

38:18.482 --> 38:19.517
Game play.

38:19.551 --> 38:22.137
They're just like, who plays the
Way you do, right?

38:22.172 --> 38:25.551
But I don'tñl know, I just feel
Like if I were to walk down and.

38:25.586 --> 38:29.655
Get my torch snuffed, why be sad
About that?

38:29.689 --> 38:30.862
I made it here.

38:30.896 --> 38:33.586
Aubry, one of the
Most brutal parts of "Survivor".

38:33.620 --> 38:36.896
Is the fact that somebody is
Typically on the bottom.

38:36.931 --> 38:40.034
But if you're with a group of
Four and there's a fifth, does.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.965
It shift that dynamic a little
Bit?

38:42.000 --> 38:46.482
I think everyone is trying to
Suss out more than just their.

38:46.517 --> 38:48.965
Alliances, like who do they
Connect with on a game level,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.034
Who speaks the same language in
The game.

38:51.068 --> 38:55.551
When you find a black cat to
Your witch in "Survivor Edge of."

38:55.586 --> 38:58.413
"Extinction," it's a perfect
Halloween night.

38:58.448 --> 39:02.793
It's like hocus-pocus,
Abracadabra, you can find that.

39:02.827 --> 39:04.034
Person at any point.

39:04.068 --> 39:05.689
Have you found your Black cat?

39:05.724 --> 39:09.413
I'm hoping I found my black
Cat or my black cats.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.000
Gavin, the other
Thing that sticks out in this.

39:12.034 --> 39:15.517
Group of five is aubry, the only
Returning player in this group.

39:15.551 --> 39:17.103
What's a positive of having
Aubry?

39:17.137 --> 39:19.655
I think she's brought advice.

39:19.689 --> 39:22.172
That's one of the big things for
Us, and I think me and aubry.

39:22.206 --> 39:23.931
Have connected on a personal
Level.

39:23.965 --> 39:27.068
I don't see her as a returning
Player as much as someone that I.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.379
Can trust down the road.

39:28.413 --> 39:31.517
That's one of the reasons I was
Attracted to her from the.

39:31.551 --> 39:32.896
Get-go.

39:32.931 --> 39:35.517
So wendy, experience
Is a positive that aubry brings.

39:35.551 --> 39:36.620
What's a negative?

39:36.655 --> 39:41.275
Well, I don't think aubry
Brings any negatives.

39:41.310 --> 39:42.793
She's just the nicest person
Ever.

39:42.827 --> 39:46.793
Wendy, is it hard for
You to separate the game from.

39:46.827 --> 39:47.103
Personal?

39:47.137 --> 39:48.344
Yeah.

39:48.379 --> 39:51.965
It's hard transition between
Normal life to this game that is.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.655
Just like you have to just drop
All your morals down.

39:54.689 --> 39:56.206
I found the transition very
Hard.

39:56.241 --> 39:59.482
I don't think I have made it
Completely yet.

39:59.517 --> 40:02.689
So gavin, where are
We in the game right now with.

40:02.724 --> 40:03.931
This group?

40:03.965 --> 40:07.862
I think us four, we're just
Getting started up the roller.

40:07.896 --> 40:09.103
Coaster.

40:09.137 --> 40:11.517
Wendy has already went down a
Couple hills and she survived,

40:11.551 --> 40:15.620
But I'm basing my vote off who I
Think is going to benefit me the.

40:15.655 --> 40:18.655
Most and who has my back for the
Days to come.

40:18.689 --> 40:20.793
Eric, do you gee with That?

40:20.827 --> 40:24.103
Yeah, I know I've had moments
Where I thought, am I getting.

40:24.137 --> 40:24.827
Duped tonight?

40:24.862 --> 40:26.931
Could this be how my game ends?

40:26.965 --> 40:30.103
But at some point you have to
Trust the people that you trust,

40:30.137 --> 40:32.758
And I think we'll forge it in
Fire tonight.

40:32.793 --> 40:36.482
Aubry, this may be a
Case where it is a very easy.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.137
Vote.

40:37.172 --> 40:38.862
No surprise, no blind sides?

40:38.896 --> 40:42.379
I can sometimes be an
Overthinker, but sometimes.

40:42.413 --> 40:47.448
Things are more simple than they
Seem.

40:47.482 --> 40:48.620
All right.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.758
It is time to vote.

40:50.793 --> 40:58.793
Wendy, you're up.

41:26.724 --> 41:34.724
I'll go tally the Votes.

41:35.172 --> 41:37.827
If anybody has a hidden immunity
Idol and you want the play it,

41:37.862 --> 41:44.241
Now would be the time to do so.

41:44.275 --> 41:45.068
Okay.

41:45.103 --> 41:51.000
I'll read the votes.

41:51.034 --> 41:56.034
First vote, aubry.

41:56.068 --> 41:56.758
Wendy.

41:56.793 --> 42:02.586
One vote aubry, one vote wendy.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.482
Aubry.

42:03.517 --> 42:10.551
That's two votes aubry, one vote
Wendy.

42:10.586 --> 42:14.482
Fifth person voted out of
"Survivor," aubry.

42:14.517 --> 42:18.137
That's three, that's enough.

42:18.172 --> 42:21.965
You guys are unbelievable
Players.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.724
You need to bring me Your torch.

42:23.758 --> 42:25.068
Wow.

42:25.103 --> 42:27.310
Wow.

42:27.344 --> 42:35.344
Damn.

42:37.068 --> 42:41.689
Aubry, the tribe has Spoken.

42:41.724 --> 42:42.586
Good luck, guys.

42:42.620 --> 42:45.241
Thanks, aub.

42:45.275 --> 42:53.275
Kill it.

43:08.724 --> 43:11.862
Wow.

43:11.896 --> 43:17.379
That's an easy decision.

43:17.413 --> 43:24.379
No-brainer.

43:40.689 --> 43:41.769
I woke up and none of this is a
Dream.

43:41.793 --> 43:43.931
I got burned real hard last
Night.

43:43.965 --> 43:48.586
I truly was blind sided in epic
Fashion with an idol and an.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.137
Extra vote in my pocket.

43:50.172 --> 43:53.689
Like j.T.-style embarrassment.

43:53.724 --> 43:57.206
I am completely in an utter
State of shock.

43:57.241 --> 44:00.103
And it's hard to know how to
Play when you don't even know.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.206
What the ending is.

44:01.241 --> 44:03.241
You don't have information.

44:03.275 --> 44:07.000
You're with angry people, and
You don't know if you're playing.

44:07.034 --> 44:12.000
A game or in a big waiting room,
But I never give up.

44:12.034 --> 44:15.620
For me as soon as it hits the
Rock bottom, that's my favorite.

44:15.655 --> 44:19.758
Part, because I know it can only
Go up.

44:19.793 --> 44:23.413
I thrive on pulling myself up
From the bottom, and that's what

44:23.448 --> 44:27.655
I'm going to do.

44:36.103 --> 44:43.206
Come on in, guys.

44:43.241 --> 44:48.655
Kama and lester getting your
First look at the manu tribe.

44:48.689 --> 44:51.068
Aubry voted out at the last
Tribal council.

44:51.103 --> 44:53.620
My god.

44:53.655 --> 44:55.965
Wow.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.551
Joe, what do you read Into that?

44:58.586 --> 44:59.734
First returning player out of
The game?

44:59.758 --> 45:03.965
Obviously the kama strong is
No longer so strong.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.034
All right, guys.

45:05.068 --> 45:09.310
Ready to get to today's reward
Challenge?

45:09.344 --> 45:12.000
For today's challenge, you're
Going to leap over a series of.

45:12.034 --> 45:13.034
Tables.

45:13.068 --> 45:15.103
You'll then pull a will every,
Dropping sandbags.

45:15.137 --> 45:18.896
You'll then work together to get
Those sandbags to the finish and.

45:18.931 --> 45:22.034
Throw those sandbags at a target
Until you drop a flag.

45:22.068 --> 45:26.448
First two tribes to drop both
Their flags win reward.

45:26.482 --> 45:28.448
Want to know what you're playing
For?

45:28.482 --> 45:29.310
Yes.

45:29.344 --> 45:30.172
Please.

45:30.206 --> 45:31.655
Show it to me.

45:31.689 --> 45:37.862
First tribe to
Finish, coffee, tea, pastries,

45:37.896 --> 45:39.389
Cookies to celebrate with back
At camp.

45:39.413 --> 45:40.655
Boy.

45:40.689 --> 45:41.827
Wow.

45:41.862 --> 45:47.206
Second tribe to
Finish, a little smaller, still.

45:47.241 --> 45:48.241
Nice.

45:48.275 --> 45:49.551
Iced coffee and cookies.

45:49.586 --> 45:52.137
Last place, nothing but another
Day back at camp with whatever.

45:52.172 --> 45:53.448
You can scrounge up.

45:53.482 --> 45:56.896
Kama, you have one extra person
Whom are you going to sit out of.

45:56.931 --> 45:58.172
This challenge?

45:58.206 --> 46:00.758
Aurora, take a spot on the
Sit-out bench.

46:00.793 --> 46:03.310
Everyone else take a minute to
Strategize.

46:03.344 --> 46:07.655
We'll get going.

46:07.689 --> 46:08.137
All right.

46:08.172 --> 46:10.482
Here we go.

46:10.517 --> 46:13.241
For reward, survivors ready?

46:13.275 --> 46:14.724
Go!

46:14.758 --> 46:16.310
Go, go go,.

46:16.344 --> 46:17.448
Go, go, go.

46:17.482 --> 46:20.275
Over the tables is
The first part of this.

46:20.310 --> 46:20.655
Challenge.

46:20.689 --> 46:21.448
Come on.

46:21.482 --> 46:22.931
Go underneath if you.

46:22.965 --> 46:24.068
Can it's easier.

46:24.103 --> 46:26.344
You got some sunnies
Getting skinned up.

46:26.379 --> 46:27.172
I can hear it.

46:27.206 --> 46:29.000
Come on, come on, come on.

46:29.034 --> 46:32.482
Start untying those Knots now.

46:32.517 --> 46:33.551
Go.

46:33.586 --> 46:36.862
Victoria, lauren, and
Julia untying knots.

46:36.896 --> 46:38.206
Good job, julia.

46:38.241 --> 46:41.000
Lauren is whipping
Through those knots.

46:41.034 --> 46:42.344
You got it, lauren.

46:42.379 --> 46:45.137
Julia doing a great
Job for kama.

46:45.172 --> 46:46.758
Good job, julia.

46:46.793 --> 46:48.103
Julia is through.

46:48.137 --> 46:48.724
You're good.

46:48.758 --> 46:49.620
Lauren is good.

46:49.655 --> 46:50.517
Victoria is good.

46:50.551 --> 46:52.068
We are very tight right now.

46:52.103 --> 46:53.482
Go, go, go, go.

46:53.517 --> 46:55.931
Two people at one
End, the other two tossing the.

46:55.965 --> 46:56.482
Bags.

46:56.517 --> 46:57.586
Come on, guys.

46:57.620 --> 46:58.758
You got it.

46:58.793 --> 47:01.896
You have to have all
The sandbags in your bin.

47:01.931 --> 47:03.586
Come on, julie, come on.

47:03.620 --> 47:05.241
Further guys, further.

47:05.275 --> 47:06.103
Further, further, further.

47:06.137 --> 47:07.310
There you go.

47:07.344 --> 47:09.113
The closer you get to
Your tribe mates, the faster.

47:09.137 --> 47:10.620
They will get them in the bins.

47:10.655 --> 47:12.413
I got these, I got these.

47:12.448 --> 47:13.310
Look over there.

47:13.344 --> 47:14.517
A couple more.

47:14.551 --> 47:15.482
Go, go, go.

47:15.517 --> 47:17.034
Got to get them all In that bin.

47:17.068 --> 47:17.724
Almost done.

47:17.758 --> 47:18.586
We're done.

47:18.620 --> 47:20.310
Kama has all theirs.

47:20.344 --> 47:20.620
You're good.

47:20.655 --> 47:23.275
Yeah!

47:23.310 --> 47:26.793
It's going to be joe
Throwing for kama.

47:26.827 --> 47:28.034
Nice.

47:28.068 --> 47:32.000
Once again joe out of
The gate starts knocking those.

47:32.034 --> 47:32.344
Targets.

47:32.379 --> 47:33.034
Faster.

47:33.068 --> 47:33.965
Come on, wardog.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.103
I got it.

47:35.137 --> 47:35.896
Don't yell at me.

47:35.931 --> 47:37.655
Lesu still working.

47:37.689 --> 47:38.172
Manu still working.

47:38.206 --> 47:39.344
Come on, guys.

47:39.379 --> 47:41.000
An early lead for Kama.

47:41.034 --> 47:43.103
Yeah, joe.

47:43.137 --> 47:46.689
Get the last one in.

47:46.724 --> 47:48.862
Lesu has theirs.

47:48.896 --> 47:50.275
You're good.

47:50.310 --> 47:51.965
Gave within a nice hit for manu.

47:52.000 --> 47:52.344
And another.

47:52.379 --> 47:54.793
Go, go.

47:54.827 --> 47:55.310
Higher.

47:55.344 --> 47:56.413
Come on, wardog.

47:56.448 --> 47:57.275
You got it.

47:57.310 --> 47:58.068
It's okay.

47:58.103 --> 48:01.344
"Survivor" is tough, Man.

48:01.379 --> 48:01.758
Nowhere to hide.

48:01.793 --> 48:02.931
Wrong way.

48:02.965 --> 48:09.965
If you never threw a
Banal, it's going to show.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.034
Let's go, joe.

48:11.068 --> 48:11.827
You got this.

48:11.862 --> 48:12.896
Joe with another hit.

48:12.931 --> 48:14.000
Nailing it, joe.

48:14.034 --> 48:15.241
And another.

48:15.275 --> 48:16.034
And another.

48:16.068 --> 48:19.241
Joe is on fire.

48:19.275 --> 48:21.275
Let's go, joe!

48:21.310 --> 48:22.344
Good job.

48:22.379 --> 48:24.482
Gavin now starting to
Get the hang of it.

48:24.517 --> 48:25.344
Good job.

48:25.379 --> 48:27.068
That one on the right.

48:27.103 --> 48:28.551
Yes, joe.

48:28.586 --> 48:29.448
Yes.

48:29.482 --> 48:32.000
Joe drops first flag For kama.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.379
Gavin drops the firsting from
For manu.

48:34.413 --> 48:39.344
Lauren now in for lesu.

48:39.379 --> 48:41.448
Yes, lauren!

48:41.482 --> 48:43.172
Lauren trying to keep
Lesu in it.

48:43.206 --> 48:44.344
Keep going, lauren.

48:44.379 --> 48:46.724
But it's a showdown
Right now between gave inane

48:46.758 --> 48:50.413
Joe.

48:50.448 --> 48:51.793
One more, one more.

48:51.827 --> 48:53.724
Joe very close.

48:53.758 --> 48:56.241
You got it.

48:56.275 --> 48:57.793
That does it.

48:57.827 --> 48:59.344
Kama wins yet again.

48:59.379 --> 49:00.827
A big reward.

49:00.862 --> 49:02.896
We are looking for one more.

49:02.931 --> 49:05.241
Lauren trying to keep lesu in
It.

49:05.275 --> 49:06.517
Someone want to go?

49:06.551 --> 49:07.689
I can come in.

49:07.724 --> 49:09.137
I can come in.

49:09.172 --> 49:10.068
It's up to you.

49:10.103 --> 49:12.241
It's going to be Wardog back in.

49:12.275 --> 49:14.000
He was completely ineffective.

49:14.034 --> 49:15.310
Come on, try it.

49:15.344 --> 49:18.310
Gavin can do it with
This toss right here.

49:18.344 --> 49:19.379
Slow down.

49:19.413 --> 49:20.965
You got time.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.655
Gavin does it for Manu.

49:23.689 --> 49:29.068
Manu wins reward sending lesu
Back to camp with absolutely.

49:29.103 --> 49:37.103
Nothing.

49:37.172 --> 49:38.137
All right.

49:38.172 --> 49:39.251
Kama, the winning streak stays
Alive.

49:39.275 --> 49:41.517
Victories in seven out of eight
Challenges.

49:41.551 --> 49:42.482
Grab your stuff.

49:42.517 --> 49:47.275
Head back to camp, and enjoy
Your reward.

49:47.310 --> 49:49.562
Manu, second case, not quite as
Much, but in this case, any.

49:49.586 --> 49:50.689
Victory is sweet.

49:50.724 --> 49:53.000
Cookies and iced coffee waiting
For you back at camp.

49:53.034 --> 49:55.413
Grab your stuff, head back to
Camp, enjoy.

49:55.448 --> 49:57.896
Lesu, got nothing for you.

49:57.931 --> 50:02.896
I think the kama tribe is on
Joe's shoulders.

50:02.931 --> 50:04.310
The dude wins everything.

50:04.344 --> 50:08.689
I'm just jealous another tribe
Has basically had a two-week.

50:08.724 --> 50:09.931
Vacation.

50:09.965 --> 50:13.965
It's just so frustrating that I
Want, that and I don't have.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
That, and there's nothing I can
Do about it.

50:30.689 --> 50:31.068
My god.

50:31.103 --> 50:31.862
My god.

50:31.896 --> 50:32.793
Everything you wanted and More?

50:32.827 --> 50:36.379
My god.

50:36.413 --> 50:37.862
Kama strong!

50:37.896 --> 50:41.379
It feels a little bit at this
Point like I'm expecting that we.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.793
Will win the challenges.

50:42.827 --> 50:46.482
And I know I shouldn't expect
That, but it's hard to even.

50:46.517 --> 50:49.931
Imagine us losing at this point.

50:49.965 --> 50:52.551
Joe, you won that challenge for
Us.

50:52.586 --> 50:57.000
I just worry that it's going
To put a bigger target on my.

50:57.034 --> 51:00.034
Back, so I'm going to feed you
All to protect me even more.

51:00.068 --> 51:03.172
I'm appreciating this right
Now and I want you to know how.

51:03.206 --> 51:04.551
Much I appreciate this.

51:04.586 --> 51:08.241
At this point, I'm pulling the
Wool over joe's eyes.

51:08.275 --> 51:09.793
He's the biggest target in this
Game.

51:09.827 --> 51:11.068
He knows he is.

51:11.103 --> 51:15.034
And I keep just pretending that
I'm going along with him, but.

51:15.068 --> 51:19.689
Short term to have joe on our
Tribe right now is a huge.

51:19.724 --> 51:20.862
Benefit.

51:20.896 --> 51:22.907
So aubry, I think they saw
The merge coming and they.

51:22.931 --> 51:24.044
Decided to take out a returning.

51:24.068 --> 51:26.517
It broke my heart a little to
Watch aubry go.

51:26.551 --> 51:31.310
Seeing aubry go home, it was
Definitely a telltale sign that.

51:31.344 --> 51:37.241
These new players are seeing us
Return-ies as threats.

51:37.275 --> 51:39.758
Strategically that really hurt
My game, because I fell like I.

51:39.793 --> 51:41.034
Could really trust her.

51:41.068 --> 51:43.724
It's really hard when you want
To come back and play this game.

51:43.758 --> 51:48.758
That you love so badly, but you
Also know that you're at a.

51:48.793 --> 51:50.965
Disadvantage as soon as you hit
The mat.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.517
You have nowhere to hide.

51:52.551 --> 52:00.551
You have no... You got no one to
Rely on.

52:00.689 --> 52:03.724
You don't.

52:03.758 --> 52:08.172
But it makes you appreciate all
The people you do rely on at.

52:08.206 --> 52:13.068
Home.

52:13.103 --> 52:17.517
I'm so blessed to have so much
Love, and I appreciate all my.

52:17.551 --> 52:18.862
People, my family.

52:18.896 --> 52:22.620
You have to take all that and
You have to use it as fuel.

52:22.655 --> 52:26.034
You have to remember that when
You think you're going home,

52:26.068 --> 52:30.655
When you think you're out on the
Outs, when you think you have no.

52:30.689 --> 52:34.827
One that wants to work with you,
That's the challenge is to how.

52:34.862 --> 52:36.068
Adaptable are you really?

52:36.103 --> 52:39.724
How much can you go beyond what
You think you're capable of?

52:39.758 --> 52:43.689
Because if you have a mindset
Where you no longer have.

52:43.724 --> 52:46.931
Options, then that's probably
Where you're at.

52:46.965 --> 52:49.413
And I don't want to be there.

52:49.448 --> 52:51.344
I like to do well in challenges.

52:51.379 --> 52:54.413
But we have to be super careful.

52:54.448 --> 52:56.413
It's going to be easier to put
Targets on us.

52:56.448 --> 53:00.275
Do you think there's bad
Blood on their side that we're.

53:00.310 --> 53:02.724
So strong and they just might
Try to take us out?

53:02.758 --> 53:04.448
Absolutely they're going to.

53:04.482 --> 53:09.034
The other tribes have seen us
Be a really strong group of.

53:09.068 --> 53:12.862
Five, and if first thing I would
Want to do is take out that.

53:12.896 --> 53:15.551
Group of five, split it up, take
Out some big threats in the.

53:15.586 --> 53:16.827
Game.

53:16.862 --> 53:19.182
So if I can make everyone feel
Like they're a big threat, maybe.

53:19.206 --> 53:20.689
We can all unite.

53:20.724 --> 53:24.137
Let's be real, you're
Beautiful and smart, med.

53:24.172 --> 53:26.482
Student, you know this game
Really well and you've been.

53:26.517 --> 53:27.137
Killer in challenges.

53:27.172 --> 53:29.413
Don't say all, that joe.

53:29.448 --> 53:31.827
You know they're all thinking
It.

53:31.862 --> 53:35.241
I don't think any of us are part
Of their plan, or if we are,

53:35.275 --> 53:36.551
It's temporarily.

53:36.586 --> 53:37.862
Yeah.

53:37.896 --> 53:42.034
People are easily threatened
By someone who can win a couple.

53:42.068 --> 53:44.862
Challenges and so we have to
Stick together.

53:44.896 --> 53:46.137
We'll go far.

53:46.172 --> 53:48.965
Because I'll win the immunities
And we get to decide where we.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.172
Want to go.

53:50.206 --> 53:52.758
When you start hearing joe
Saying that you're a threat,

53:52.793 --> 53:56.793
It's like, crap, like if
People see me as a threat, that.

53:56.827 --> 54:01.827
Is going to make my game a lot
Harder once we do get to a.

54:01.862 --> 54:05.931
Merge, so I'm definitely
Anticipating having to adapt and.

54:05.965 --> 54:13.965
Rearrange some things to stay in
The game.

54:16.068 --> 54:18.000
Joe is amazing again.

54:18.034 --> 54:22.103
My god, what must it be
Like to be him?

54:22.137 --> 54:26.931
I really think we should take
Advantage of this low tide.

54:26.965 --> 54:27.758
There's crabs down.

54:27.793 --> 54:29.551
There maybe crab legs for
Dinner.

54:29.586 --> 54:29.931
I don't know.

54:29.965 --> 54:31.758
I'm down.

54:31.793 --> 54:35.275
I need something.

54:35.310 --> 54:36.724
We lost.

54:36.758 --> 54:37.310
Yet again.

54:37.344 --> 54:38.896
And it's so frustrating.

54:38.931 --> 54:43.758
It's not even that we're losing,
It's that we're losing, and we.

54:43.793 --> 54:48.482
Come back to this crappy-ass
Beach that has no food, a crappy.

54:48.517 --> 54:49.413
Shelter.

54:49.448 --> 54:51.344
We're sleeping in the mud.

54:51.379 --> 54:55.517
It's 24 hour days of just hell,
Absolute hell.

54:55.551 --> 54:59.517
I literally never cry at home,
And I've cried like four days in.

54:59.551 --> 55:01.827
A row now.

55:01.862 --> 55:04.862
I'm dying, like literally
Walking up and down I was.

55:04.896 --> 55:05.206
Blacking out.

55:05.241 --> 55:06.724
Really?

55:06.758 --> 55:07.724
Yes.

55:07.758 --> 55:10.068
I'm so hungry, but the rice
Makes me so sick.

55:10.103 --> 55:12.413
I can't function.

55:12.448 --> 55:16.689
Girl, you and I are like the
Only people doing things like.

55:16.724 --> 55:17.838
Super physical in the
Challenges.

55:17.862 --> 55:20.724
I need you.

55:20.758 --> 55:23.620
I just need that merge right
Now.

55:23.655 --> 55:26.827
We've had almost no food for
Days.

55:26.862 --> 55:28.586
And we're all feeling it.

55:28.620 --> 55:32.586
Especially lauren.

55:32.620 --> 55:33.689
He found a crab.

55:33.724 --> 55:36.344
Pull that thing up.

55:36.379 --> 55:41.310
He's really on there.

55:41.344 --> 55:44.931
The idea of fishing I think
Is counterintuitive because we.

55:44.965 --> 55:48.000
Need to save our calories and
Energy for these challenges.

55:48.034 --> 55:49.965
How are they getting away.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.827
But at least david still has
Life.

55:51.862 --> 55:52.965
You know?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.206
Lauren is kind of like giving
Up.

55:56.241 --> 55:58.103
Maybe she's the one to go next.

55:58.137 --> 56:00.482
I know that wentworth is good
With it.

56:00.517 --> 56:05.137
But to pull it off, I need
David.

56:05.172 --> 56:07.241
I feel very torn right now.

56:07.275 --> 56:12.206
Lauren is somebody that I've
Been close to from day one.

56:12.241 --> 56:13.862
But her mind is not in the game.

56:13.896 --> 56:14.586
Right.

56:14.620 --> 56:18.965
I can see her just twimping.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.034
I need someone who will ride or
Die.

56:21.068 --> 56:24.172
Let's just say we lost lauren,
Are you with us to the end, ride.

56:24.206 --> 56:25.103
Or die?

56:25.137 --> 56:27.482
I don't think I have a
Choice, but yes.

56:27.517 --> 56:29.896
Hopefully we just win and
Whatever.

56:29.931 --> 56:32.965
I understand that at some
Point I might have to vote out

56:33.000 --> 56:33.655
Lauren.

56:33.689 --> 56:36.172
She's literally wasting away.

56:36.206 --> 56:39.551
However, wardog, who is a
Psychowhen it comes to number.

56:39.586 --> 56:42.586
Crunching and flipping
Alliances, he's almost scaring.

56:42.620 --> 56:43.482
Me now.

56:43.517 --> 56:46.586
I don't know if I want to work
With him.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.379
The thing is I feel like with
Him I just agree a lot.

56:49.413 --> 56:51.000
That's what I do.

56:51.034 --> 56:53.172
He doesn't want to hear your
Opinion.

56:53.206 --> 56:55.700
He really wants to bark an order
At you and have you go on with.

56:55.724 --> 56:56.275
It.

56:56.310 --> 56:57.862
It's a dictatorship.

56:57.896 --> 57:02.896
Wardog is playing really
Hard, flipping back and forth,

57:02.931 --> 57:04.206
And it's really annoying.

57:04.241 --> 57:07.000
He does nothing at camp he
Spends most of his days.

57:07.034 --> 57:08.251
Strategizing and crunching
Numbers.

57:08.275 --> 57:12.344
Also he sucks at these physical
Challenge, and all of that is.

57:12.379 --> 57:17.103
Putting a huge target on his
Back, which is great with me.

57:17.137 --> 57:18.251
We have to do whatever is
Best for us.

57:18.275 --> 57:19.517
I'm with you.

57:19.551 --> 57:24.965
When the game started, I wanted
To vote out wentworth, but now

57:25.000 --> 57:28.482
I'm working with the person who
I thought was my biggest.

57:28.517 --> 57:30.148
Adversary out here, but if
That's going to get me to day

57:30.172 --> 57:32.172
39, then that's what I'm going
To do.

57:45.827 --> 57:46.310
What's up?

57:46.344 --> 57:47.379
I got more info.

57:47.413 --> 57:51.034
This morning we found a basket
With five new maps.

57:51.068 --> 57:54.517
They look the same as before,
Except there's a bunch of holes.

57:54.551 --> 58:00.482
So I'm assuming that means
There's something else to find.

58:00.517 --> 58:03.344
Can we lessen the level of
Paranoia this time and no one.

58:03.379 --> 58:05.275
Take off?

58:05.310 --> 58:07.068
No promises.

58:07.103 --> 58:10.551
We get the map and everyone
Starts following it.

58:10.586 --> 58:13.241
I'm a newbie in this edge of
Extinction language.

58:13.275 --> 58:14.413
All right.

58:14.448 --> 58:16.137
I'm going to go ahead and go.

58:16.172 --> 58:18.655
I don't know what the hell is
Going on.

58:18.689 --> 58:22.241
But they seem to know if you
Fold it and something points,

58:22.275 --> 58:28.206
You're going to find an
Advantage.

58:28.241 --> 58:30.620
Is this thing even out here?

58:30.655 --> 58:36.034
There's mad scramble up top.

58:36.068 --> 58:38.724
I was able to figure out first
Map.

58:38.758 --> 58:41.482
But the second map was much
Harder than I thought.

58:41.517 --> 58:44.827
I'm looking everywhere and then
Finally it's like, my gosh,

58:44.862 --> 58:52.862
It's on the beach.

58:54.482 --> 58:57.896
What I figured out is all the
Holes line up to one hole.

58:57.931 --> 59:00.482
When you layer that on top of
The other map, it puts it right.

59:00.517 --> 59:06.862
Next to the mast.

59:06.896 --> 59:07.896
Come on.

59:07.931 --> 59:10.862
I was so sure it was there.

59:10.896 --> 59:16.379
I dug and dug, but apparently I
Was at the wrong spot.

59:16.413 --> 59:19.896
I know devens is good with Maps.

59:19.931 --> 59:24.034
So I'm thinking maybe he's just
Off a little bit.

59:24.068 --> 59:28.034
Then I think when it's super low
Tide, there are all these rocks.

59:28.068 --> 59:30.551
Showing themselves, so I start
Walking by the water to see if.

59:30.586 --> 59:34.448
Maybe it was in there.

59:34.482 --> 59:42.482
What is that?

59:45.068 --> 59:46.241
Freaking insane.

59:46.275 --> 59:48.793
This entire time I have
Needed a breakthrough, and then.

59:48.827 --> 59:54.793
All of a sudden in the sea water
I found this.

59:54.827 --> 59:56.137
Chris, he's got it.

59:56.172 --> 59:57.758
Thank you, jesus.

59:57.793 --> 01:00:03.724
When the time come, penalize
Your biggest threat by assigning.

01:00:03.758 --> 01:00:05.413
These maps to them.

01:00:05.448 --> 01:00:07.965
This is exactly what I prayed
For.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.079
Chris has been getting the best
Of me.

01:00:09.103 --> 01:00:13.310
This is going to let me put a
Little curse on chris.

01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:15.493
Apparently we're going to have
Some kind of competition, and.

01:00:15.517 --> 01:00:17.448
This could help myself get back
In the game.

01:00:17.482 --> 01:00:19.172
I needed it.

01:00:19.206 --> 01:00:22.034
And thank god that I got it.

01:00:22.068 --> 01:00:25.862
I'm just pissed because I said,
What do you have.

01:00:25.896 --> 01:00:27.482
But I didn't touch it first.

01:00:27.517 --> 01:00:30.724
What the hell, reem?

01:00:30.758 --> 01:00:31.482
You gave it to someone else.

01:00:31.517 --> 01:00:35.172
You think I gave it away?

01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:36.241
I'm not that stupid.

01:00:36.275 --> 01:00:37.758
I wanted that.

01:00:37.793 --> 01:00:38.758
The rules are the rules.

01:00:38.793 --> 01:00:41.482
Those two get on my damn nerves.

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:47.172
You just accused me of giving
Away an advantage.

01:00:47.206 --> 01:00:48.700
Do I have complete idiot written
On my forehead.

01:00:48.724 --> 01:00:49.803
I don't even know what to Say.

01:00:49.827 --> 01:00:53.482
You just said I gave it to Him.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:56.103
Don't you tell me I gave
Something away.

01:00:56.137 --> 01:00:59.655
Well, you point at it and he
Picks it up and runs away.

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:02.413
You got the biggest mouth in
The whole country.

01:01:02.448 --> 01:01:05.344
You're the one who said I gave
Him the advantage.

01:01:05.379 --> 01:01:08.827
By saying that, you lit off a
Volcano, bro.

01:01:08.862 --> 01:01:11.275
It is a disaster here.

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:15.379
It truly is the most
Dysfunctional family I've ever.

01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:15.931
Met.

01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:17.172
I don't need zero.

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:18.827
Then why are you talking
About it?

01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:22.862
Because you're getting on my
nerves, and it's 12.

01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:25.655
Days of listening to the bull.

01:01:25.689 --> 01:01:26.931
And I'm done with it.

01:01:26.965 --> 01:01:30.827
The worst part of it all, no
One knows how long this train.

01:01:30.862 --> 01:01:32.034
Wreck can last.

01:01:32.068 --> 01:01:35.827
That's a scary situation,
Because people are legitimately.

01:01:35.862 --> 01:01:36.896
Losing it.

01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:40.931
Reem, that's all...

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:56.275
Come on in, guys.

01:02:10.034 --> 01:02:10.896
All right.

01:02:10.931 --> 01:02:12.551
Let's get to today's immunity
Challenge.

01:02:12.586 --> 01:02:16.655
First things first, got to take
Back the idol.

01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:17.137
Thank you.

01:02:17.172 --> 01:02:22.034
Thank you.

01:02:22.068 --> 01:02:24.931
Once again immunity is back up
For grabs.

01:02:24.965 --> 01:02:28.000
For today's challenge, you're
Going to climb a ladder and then.

01:02:28.034 --> 01:02:32.034
Maneuver a bag attached to a
Rope through a bamboo frame.

01:02:32.068 --> 01:02:37.931
You'll then use the ball inside
To drop the cage door.

01:02:37.965 --> 01:02:45.034
Sprint to the finish to solve a
"Survivor" slide puzzle.

01:02:45.068 --> 01:02:46.551
Kama, you have one extra person.

01:02:46.586 --> 01:02:47.827
Who you going to sit out?

01:02:47.862 --> 01:02:50.862
Aurora sat out at the reward
Challenge.

01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:53.413
Ron, take a spot in the sit-out
Bench.

01:02:53.448 --> 01:02:54.241
One extra thing.

01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:55.551
No.

01:02:56.793 --> 01:03:01.793
This challenge only
The first tribe to finish wins.

01:03:01.827 --> 01:03:02.758
Immunity.

01:03:02.793 --> 01:03:05.275
The two losing tribes go to
Tribal council.

01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:06.275
My god.

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:07.551
Wow.

01:03:07.586 --> 01:03:09.862
I'll give you a
Minute to strategize.

01:03:09.896 --> 01:03:10.862
We'll get started.

01:03:10.896 --> 01:03:16.137
Wow.

01:03:16.172 --> 01:03:16.655
All right.

01:03:16.689 --> 01:03:18.448
Here we go.

01:03:18.482 --> 01:03:22.310
For immunity, survivors ready?

01:03:22.344 --> 01:03:24.241
Go!

01:03:24.275 --> 01:03:30.344
Get up that ladder, and then
Start tracing that bag along the.

01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:32.620
Ropes to get it out of the
Bamboo frame.

01:03:32.655 --> 01:03:34.965
Try not to let it...

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.965
You can't get ahead Of the bag.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.758
You're only as slow as that
Person working on the bag.

01:03:40.793 --> 01:03:46.034
It is kama in the lead, which is
Becoming predictable story in.

01:03:46.068 --> 01:03:46.896
Challenges this season.

01:03:46.931 --> 01:03:50.655
And then manu and lester side by
Side.

01:03:50.689 --> 01:03:54.103
It's going to be kama out first
With their bag.

01:03:54.137 --> 01:03:55.689
Aurora is down.

01:03:55.724 --> 01:03:56.965
Here comes julie and joe.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.482
They've got to untie it now.

01:03:58.517 --> 01:03:59.206
Come on.

01:03:59.241 --> 01:03:59.827
Go.

01:03:59.862 --> 01:04:00.965
Manu coming down.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.551
Got to untie their knots.

01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:05.620
It is now lesu in dead last once
Again.

01:04:05.655 --> 01:04:07.379
Julia working on the knots.

01:04:07.413 --> 01:04:08.586
You're good!

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.689
Joe now going to start untying
Knots on the bag, trying to.

01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:14.482
Release that monkey's fist.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.931
Up on the platform.

01:04:15.965 --> 01:04:17.586
Manu, you're good.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.724
Going to be gavin untying knots
For manu.

01:04:20.758 --> 01:04:21.448
Lauren's got it.

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:22.724
It's going to be wardog now.

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:24.172
Come on, joe.

01:04:24.206 --> 01:04:26.068
Joe has that monkey Fist.

01:04:26.103 --> 01:04:28.527
Now he's looking to drop it in
That hoop, which will drop that.

01:04:28.551 --> 01:04:32.310
Cage door.

01:04:32.344 --> 01:04:37.034
Joe drops the cage for kama on
His very first toss.

01:04:37.068 --> 01:04:39.724
Good toss.

01:04:39.758 --> 01:04:40.965
Gavin tosses.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.172
He drops his cage.

01:04:42.206 --> 01:04:43.448
Go, manu.

01:04:43.482 --> 01:04:47.310
Two people on the puzzle now,
Going to be "Julie & julia" for.

01:04:47.344 --> 01:04:47.896
Kama.

01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:49.275
You got this, wardog.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.931
Give the rope some slack.

01:04:50.965 --> 01:04:52.068
Manu is over.

01:04:52.103 --> 01:04:54.206
It's going to be victoria and
Eric.

01:04:54.241 --> 01:04:57.586
Here we go, wardog.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.517
Wardog, no, no, no.

01:04:58.551 --> 01:05:00.448
You got to stay on It.ÑI

01:05:00.482 --> 01:05:01.655
no!

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:02.827
Okay.

01:05:02.862 --> 01:05:03.827
Sorry.

01:05:03.862 --> 01:05:06.241
Wardog has not had a
Lot of success.

01:05:06.275 --> 01:05:08.862
Wardog's got it for lesu.

01:05:08.896 --> 01:05:10.931
Awkward but accomplished it.

01:05:10.965 --> 01:05:16.413
Get over that cage.

01:05:16.448 --> 01:05:19.034
It is david and wentworth for
Lesu.

01:05:19.068 --> 01:05:22.379
Everybody now working on the
Puzzle.

01:05:22.413 --> 01:05:23.551
Julie going to step out.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:24.862
Joe and julia in now.

01:05:24.896 --> 01:05:26.034
Okay, joe.

01:05:26.068 --> 01:05:27.068
I got it.

01:05:27.103 --> 01:05:27.758
I got it.

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:28.965
I think I got it.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.379
This puzzle could
Take a very long time or if you.

01:05:32.413 --> 01:05:37.655
Know your way around a slide
Puzzle, you could get this very.

01:05:37.689 --> 01:05:38.896
Fast.

01:05:38.931 --> 01:05:40.344
David thinks he has something.

01:05:40.379 --> 01:05:42.931
Lesu has been on a losing streak
Of epic proportions.

01:05:42.965 --> 01:05:45.379
Ready?

01:05:45.413 --> 01:05:50.034
Can lesu pull out a
Victory right now?

01:05:50.068 --> 01:05:51.448
Jeffrey?

01:05:51.482 --> 01:05:55.586
Kama thinks they have
It and they do.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.517
Wow.

01:05:58.551 --> 01:05:59.448
My god.

01:05:59.482 --> 01:06:02.931
Joe and julia solve It for kama.

01:06:02.965 --> 01:06:10.620
Kama wins immunity sending lesu
And manu to tribal council.

01:06:10.655 --> 01:06:15.275
Once again kama wins immunity.

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:16.620
Nobody going home.

01:06:16.655 --> 01:06:17.448
Nice work.

01:06:17.482 --> 01:06:20.482
Grab your stuff, head back to
Camp.

01:06:20.517 --> 01:06:24.551
All right, lesu, manu, tonight
Both tribes will come to tribal.

01:06:24.586 --> 01:06:29.758
Council together and vote one
Person out of the game.

01:06:29.793 --> 01:06:30.965
Grab your stuff.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.586
Head back to camp.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.660
See you tonight at tribal.

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:35.482
Going into tribal tonight,
I'm like panicking.

01:06:35.517 --> 01:06:38.206
There's four lesu and four manu.

01:06:38.241 --> 01:06:41.724
We could find ourselves at a tie
And going to rocks.

01:06:41.758 --> 01:06:45.827
I have gone to rocks before, and
As a fan, it's exhilarating.

01:06:45.862 --> 01:06:48.172
As a player it's nauseating.

01:06:48.206 --> 01:06:50.310
Strap yourself in, everybody.

01:06:50.344 --> 01:06:53.344
It's going to be chaotic.

01:07:08.965 --> 01:07:10.758
The challenge went horribly.

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.034
Kama wins again.

01:07:12.068 --> 01:07:16.965
With the added twist that both
Tribes will be going to tribal.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.344
Council.

01:07:17.379 --> 01:07:19.310
Wait for it.

01:07:19.344 --> 01:07:20.172
Drum roll.

01:07:20.206 --> 01:07:21.448
Together.

01:07:21.482 --> 01:07:25.103
Which is an interesting problem,
Because if we go to a 4-4 tie,

01:07:25.137 --> 01:07:26.068
Everyone votes again.

01:07:26.103 --> 01:07:29.103
If no one changes their vote, we
Draw rocks.

01:07:29.137 --> 01:07:30.344
Anyone can go home.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:34.172
First of all, I think the
Best thing we could do is stick.

01:07:34.206 --> 01:07:35.137
Together as a four.

01:07:35.172 --> 01:07:37.310
We can't possibly split.

01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:39.862
Are you all willing to draw
Stones?

01:07:39.896 --> 01:07:42.103
That's the thing.

01:07:42.137 --> 01:07:43.344
We have no alliance.

01:07:43.379 --> 01:07:47.000
So if we hit lauren or wardog, I
Think they would flip on our.

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:48.206
Side.

01:07:48.241 --> 01:07:50.493
I think we have a really good
Shot in being able to sway

01:07:50.517 --> 01:07:54.758
David, because the lesu tribe,
At least from when I was part of.

01:07:54.793 --> 01:07:57.206
That tribe, they weren't loyal
To each other, and he doesn't.

01:07:57.241 --> 01:08:01.103
Have the numbers to survive the
Merge, so I'm hoping that david.

01:08:01.137 --> 01:08:02.689
Realizes that he's on a sinking
Ship.

01:08:02.724 --> 01:08:05.379
I think that somebody will do
It.

01:08:05.413 --> 01:08:08.758
I don't think they would all
Go to rocks.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:11.044
What returning player is going
To come back for a third time.

01:08:11.068 --> 01:08:12.689
And be willing to go to rocks?

01:08:12.724 --> 01:08:15.758
I think right now the fact
That they have two returning.

01:08:15.793 --> 01:08:19.103
Players is an advantage for us.

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:22.517
You don't come out here two,
Three, times to get sent home.

01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:23.724
Before the merge by a rock.

01:08:23.758 --> 01:08:27.448
So in terms of this crappy
Situation, I feel like our side.

01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:31.000
Could possibly be slightly
Better off.

01:08:31.033 --> 01:08:35.724
If we will all go to rocks, I
Think all we have to say is, you.

01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:38.827
Can believe us or not, but we're
Willing to go to rocks tonight.

01:08:38.862 --> 01:08:40.827
We don't think your tribe is.

01:08:40.862 --> 01:08:42.517
Roll the dice?

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.620
I think that's our best bet.

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:47.000
Everything is a gamble Tonight.

01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:49.274
But I'm a big fan of this game.

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.792
I've been imagining myself in
These exact situations for.

01:08:52.827 --> 01:08:54.033
Years.

01:08:54.068 --> 01:08:58.965
You don't imagine yourself in
The easy tribal council vote.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.482
You think yowfers in this
Situation, going into tribal.

01:09:02.517 --> 01:09:04.412
Council, probably going to go to
Rocks.

01:09:04.448 --> 01:09:07.792
That's what makes a person like
Me at home want to play this.

01:09:07.827 --> 01:09:08.620
Game.

01:09:08.654 --> 01:09:10.654
It's this, tonight, but is it
Scary?

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:11.241
Yeah.

01:09:11.274 --> 01:09:12.206
I could go home tonight.

01:09:12.241 --> 01:09:15.586
No question.

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.724
Do you think they're more likely
To put votes on you or me?

01:09:18.758 --> 01:09:23.792
I have no idea.

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:25.620
I wish I knew.

01:09:25.654 --> 01:09:27.103
And you'll go to rocks?

01:09:27.136 --> 01:09:29.379
I guess.

01:09:29.412 --> 01:09:30.424
I'd be willing to do that.

01:09:30.448 --> 01:09:32.412
I don't want to go to the next
Stage without you.

01:09:32.448 --> 01:09:33.448
Of course.

01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:34.171
We're in it together.

01:09:34.206 --> 01:09:35.171
You're my man.

01:09:35.206 --> 01:09:37.827
No one wants to go out with
Rocks.

01:09:37.862 --> 01:09:40.689
That's the big fear in this
Game, but I did sign up to play.

01:09:40.724 --> 01:09:41.620
"Survivor."

01:09:41.654 --> 01:09:42.907
I feel like that's what I'm
Doing tonight.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:46.171
So it feels good, but I'm also
Going to be crapping bricks.

01:09:46.206 --> 01:09:50.620
I have 100% trust in eric and
Victoria.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:54.413
And after last tribal council,
Wendy is with us 100%.

01:09:54.448 --> 01:09:56.275
I'll draw rocks for one of them.

01:09:56.310 --> 01:10:04.310
I hope the god they'd do the
Same for me.

01:10:04.448 --> 01:10:07.482
This is going to be a huge
Move either way, but I think it.

01:10:07.517 --> 01:10:08.586
Can work.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:10.493
I just want to make sure we're
All on the same page.

01:10:10.517 --> 01:10:11.724
No question.

01:10:11.758 --> 01:10:14.931
The whole thing tonight could
Come down to drawing rocks.

01:10:14.965 --> 01:10:18.862
We just all agreed that we're
All down for that.

01:10:18.896 --> 01:10:20.137
I'm not.

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:22.562
I'm kind of willing to put my
Vote wherever to keep me in the.

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:23.827
Game.

01:10:23.862 --> 01:10:27.137
If I feel like I need to betray
An alliance to move myself one.

01:10:27.172 --> 01:10:30.000
Step further in the game, I'm
Going to do it, because I can.

01:10:30.034 --> 01:10:31.517
Find an in somewhere else.

01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:32.862
Don't ever trust me, man.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:40.896
I don't know if anyone has
Figured that out yet.ÑI.

01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:41.551
Okay.

01:10:41.586 --> 01:10:42.655
So here's the thing.

01:10:42.689 --> 01:10:45.724
If I were them, I would stay
Four strong.

01:10:46.413 --> 01:10:47.896
Try and flip one of you.

01:10:47.931 --> 01:10:48.344
Correct.

01:10:48.379 --> 01:10:49.586
Right.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.034
I want to take out one of the
Big guy, but I feel like the.

01:10:53.068 --> 01:10:55.793
Last person they would think we
Would take out would be.

01:10:55.827 --> 01:10:56.310
Victorya.

01:10:56.344 --> 01:10:57.000
What do you think?

01:10:57.034 --> 01:10:59.896
Four votes on wendy, right?

01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:04.862
We vote, one of them might be
Like do, you want the draw rocks.

01:11:04.896 --> 01:11:05.689
For wendy.

01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:07.010
They might flip on wendy right
There.

01:11:07.034 --> 01:11:10.482
Once again, wardog didn't
Thereon what anybody else had to.

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.172
Say.

01:11:11.206 --> 01:11:12.413
He tries to overpower people.

01:11:12.448 --> 01:11:15.241
He's got his plan, and that's
That.

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:17.724
But to be honest, wardog is
Right.

01:11:17.758 --> 01:11:20.862
Wendy is not an original kama
Member.

01:11:20.896 --> 01:11:25.482
So hopefully we have to revote
Someone will flip and help us.

01:11:25.517 --> 01:11:27.310
Vote her out.

01:11:27.344 --> 01:11:31.827
I think I should go over to
Wendy and say vote for whatever.

01:11:31.862 --> 01:11:33.103
Name we want her to vote for.

01:11:33.137 --> 01:11:35.965
It goes 4, 3, 1...

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.172
I think they're going to vote
For me, because they're going to.

01:11:39.206 --> 01:11:40.586
Think kelley or you has the
Idol.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.517
I think she would be the
Logical vote.

01:11:42.551 --> 01:11:44.379
We just can't crumble.

01:11:44.413 --> 01:11:45.413
That's the thing.

01:11:45.448 --> 01:11:46.241
We cannot.

01:11:46.275 --> 01:11:48.517
We have to go in there four
Strong.

01:11:48.551 --> 01:11:50.034
I'll go to rockings.

01:11:50.068 --> 01:11:50.931
I'll go to rocks.

01:11:50.965 --> 01:11:51.517
Me too.

01:11:51.551 --> 01:11:54.241
I've done it before.

01:11:54.275 --> 01:11:56.931
This plan makes me really
Nervous.

01:11:56.965 --> 01:12:01.965
I didn't come this far just to
Go to rocks, but wardog always.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.137
Has his own agendas and nobody
Can even have an input.

01:12:06.172 --> 01:12:07.862
So I'm pissed.

01:12:07.896 --> 01:12:11.068
I'm so close to making the
Merge, and this could ruin.

01:12:11.103 --> 01:12:12.793
Everything.

01:12:12.827 --> 01:12:13.862
We got to merge tomorrow.

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:14.724
I'm so hungry.

01:12:14.758 --> 01:12:15.586
Okay.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.896
We need a ton more firewood for
This.

01:12:18.931 --> 01:12:20.965
Just to keep us going.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.275
I got like 15, 20 minutes to
Dry this wood out.

01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:26.068
Okay.

01:12:26.103 --> 01:12:34.103
I'll go down to the beach.

01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:36.586
He doesn't contribute at all.

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:37.413
It's crazy.

01:12:37.448 --> 01:12:39.620
He's so obviously like Plotting.

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:42.827
He's totally plotting.

01:12:42.862 --> 01:12:46.586
We have a good plan tonight,
However, I'm worried to death.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.655
About lauren.

01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:48.862
She isn't well.

01:12:48.896 --> 01:12:52.275
All she talks about is the
Merge, food, merge, food, merge,

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:53.103
Food.

01:12:53.137 --> 01:12:54.689
I can't work with someone like
That.

01:12:54.724 --> 01:12:58.655
So I'm like do, I really want to
Go to rocks for this girl?

01:12:58.689 --> 01:13:00.586
I'm not so sure.

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:02.448
Let's go explore.

01:13:02.482 --> 01:13:04.965
However, the manu tribe might be
Targeting me.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.551
But if I can find an idol that
Will give me tremendous power.

01:13:12.586 --> 01:13:16.172
Wardog?

01:13:16.206 --> 01:13:17.689
I can in the believe it.

01:13:17.724 --> 01:13:20.448
He literally does nothing.

01:13:20.482 --> 01:13:21.448
It's insane.

01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:22.689
Like where is he?

01:13:22.724 --> 01:13:25.034
He's probably looking for the
Idol.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:26.413
Wardog disappeared.

01:13:26.448 --> 01:13:27.862
He's not helping at all.

01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:29.827
He's not contributing at all.

01:13:29.862 --> 01:13:31.758
He goes off into the jungle.

01:13:31.793 --> 01:13:33.620
Wardog is creating a war.

01:13:33.655 --> 01:13:38.793
I guess that's what war dogs do.

01:13:38.827 --> 01:13:39.931
He's being divisive.

01:13:39.965 --> 01:13:40.827
We need to be united.

01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:42.551
I'm going to go look for it.

01:13:42.586 --> 01:13:50.586
Let's go look I guess, right?

01:13:55.793 --> 01:13:56.862
Where were you?

01:13:56.896 --> 01:13:58.000
Down by the beach.

01:13:58.034 --> 01:13:59.068
We couldn't find you.

01:13:59.103 --> 01:14:01.655
You weren't looking hard Enough.

01:14:01.689 --> 01:14:04.482
I want to find the idol
Before wardog.

01:14:04.517 --> 01:14:06.379
He's a schemer and manipulator.

01:14:06.413 --> 01:14:07.527
He's already calling the shots.

01:14:07.551 --> 01:14:10.448
And with an idol, he's just
Going to get more and more.

01:14:10.482 --> 01:14:11.689
Powerful.

01:14:11.724 --> 01:14:12.862
It shouldn't be this hard.

01:14:12.896 --> 01:14:13.379
It shouldn't.

01:14:13.413 --> 01:14:14.206
This is ridiculous.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:16.103
I have no idea.

01:14:16.137 --> 01:14:20.655
And then I look up in the tree,
And, bing, it's just sitting.

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:21.517
Right there.

01:14:21.551 --> 01:14:29.137
Let's go on the other side of
Camp.

01:14:29.172 --> 01:14:30.965
I'm going the stay here.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.655
In "Survivor," you never give
Up, because this game is always.

01:14:33.689 --> 01:14:34.931
Changing.

01:14:34.965 --> 01:14:37.655
And neg that tonight is such a
Crazy tribal potentially, having.

01:14:37.689 --> 01:14:41.310
That safety is huge.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:49.344
I'm perplexed.

01:14:52.793 --> 01:14:54.793
Tonight's tribal council is
Huge.

01:14:54.827 --> 01:14:56.965
Kelley and I have idols.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.448
I have no idea what I'm going to
Do.

01:14:58.482 --> 01:14:59.862
It's not worth going home.

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:01.034
I know.

01:15:01.068 --> 01:15:03.586
Tonight the manu tribe is
Most likely targeting me or.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.862
Wardog.

01:15:04.896 --> 01:15:06.562
Everyone is banking on the fact
That they're not going to want.

01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:10.413
To go to rocks for wendy, but if
They stay strong, rocks will.

01:15:10.448 --> 01:15:11.379
Determine who goes home.

01:15:11.413 --> 01:15:16.793
I really don't want the draw
Rocks.

01:15:16.827 --> 01:15:19.586
Would you go to rocks for
Wardog?

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.448
I'm not going to rocks for
Wardog.

01:15:22.482 --> 01:15:27.206
If we go to rock, it's a 1-6
Chance you go home some if.

01:15:27.241 --> 01:15:29.310
They're voting for wardog, I'm
Going to flip.

01:15:29.344 --> 01:15:32.310
But I can see them going after
Me, so I got to decide if I'm.

01:15:32.344 --> 01:15:34.379
Going to play my idol or not.

01:15:34.413 --> 01:15:38.034
Tonight is going to be a lot of
On-the-sly decisions.

01:15:38.068 --> 01:15:41.068
You just never know what's going
To happen.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.931
All right.

01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:12.517
Two trikes gear to vote out one
Person.

01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:15.862
Victoria, any time there's a
Twist involving tribal, it can.

01:16:15.896 --> 01:16:17.689
Be unnerving.

01:16:17.724 --> 01:16:21.000
Did you feel a different sense
At manu this afternoon?

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:23.448
I would say the main
Difference was there were no.

01:16:23.482 --> 01:16:24.724
Side conversations.

01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:29.172
It was one large conversation
Because we got even tribes here.

01:16:29.206 --> 01:16:30.413
It's four against four.

01:16:30.448 --> 01:16:33.034
If we're not all on the same
Page, we're immediately screwed.

01:16:33.068 --> 01:16:35.241
Let's talking about the lesu
Tribe.

01:16:35.275 --> 01:16:38.206
Lauren, was it similar to manu
In that you all got together and.

01:16:38.241 --> 01:16:39.320
Said, we have to be united.

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:42.310
We didn't even have to talk
About staying united.

01:16:42.344 --> 01:16:44.241
We knew we were going the stay
United.

01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:48.862
We're a very strong four that
Genuinely has been through so.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:49.931
Much.

01:16:49.965 --> 01:16:52.379
Wardog, pretty
Interesting, four from one.

01:16:52.413 --> 01:16:54.551
Tribe, four from another, but
Only one going home.

01:16:54.586 --> 01:16:57.965
It's kind of crazy, because
When you first said only one.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.827
Tribe gets immunity, I felt that
Pain in my stomach, but when you.

01:17:01.862 --> 01:17:05.896
Find out 1 out of 8, preparing
For the gun knight at the o.K.

01:17:05.931 --> 01:17:06.448
Corral.

01:17:06.482 --> 01:17:10.275
I have my wyatt earp.

01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:11.896
That makes me doc holiday.

01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:12.931
We have our plan.

01:17:12.965 --> 01:17:14.448
We're going to stick with each
Other.

01:17:14.482 --> 01:17:17.448
It's going to be fun
the tricky thing is they.

01:17:17.482 --> 01:17:21.275
Don't know us in a tribe in the
Same way we don't know them.

01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:23.620
So it's hard to put a lot of
Weight into anything that's.

01:17:23.655 --> 01:17:24.758
Said.

01:17:24.793 --> 01:17:26.724
Wentworth, this
Really is "Survivor" warfare.

01:17:26.758 --> 01:17:29.586
I think this is definitely a
Battle tonight, but we are four.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:30.620
Strong.

01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:33.379
We would welcome anyone over
Here with open arms.

01:17:33.413 --> 01:17:39.344
Gavin is... gaferren,
Wentworth is saying, join us.

01:17:39.379 --> 01:17:41.482
Right now and we'll change the
Game.

01:17:41.517 --> 01:17:42.793
That's a great speech.

01:17:42.827 --> 01:17:46.103
I would like to extend the same
Thing to you guys, because we're.

01:17:46.137 --> 01:17:48.724
Going to stick stroke to our
Gun, as well.

01:17:48.758 --> 01:17:52.034
Wendy, one other
Interesting aspects is you have.

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:53.172
Some insight.

01:17:53.206 --> 01:17:55.379
Did the tribe look to you and
Say, what do you think?

01:17:55.413 --> 01:17:57.965
That's essentially what
Happened.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.068
I feel like I'm having a
Flashback on my first part of.

01:18:01.103 --> 01:18:02.034
The game.

01:18:02.068 --> 01:18:04.000
So it's like I'm basically in
The middle.

01:18:04.034 --> 01:18:05.931
David, that's Interesting.

01:18:05.965 --> 01:18:07.827
Wendy didn't say, I used to be
With them.

01:18:07.862 --> 01:18:10.068
She said, I feel like I'm in the
Middle.

01:18:10.103 --> 01:18:12.034
Yeah, that's really good to
Hear.

01:18:12.068 --> 01:18:15.448
I think it was unfortunate that
The swap kicked wendy out of the.

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:19.551
Group of people, but we still
Consider her part of the tribe.

01:18:19.586 --> 01:18:21.068
All of a sudden.

01:18:21.103 --> 01:18:22.827
We love you, wendy.

01:18:22.862 --> 01:18:23.896
We always did.

01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:27.793
That wasn't the sense when
She received wendy.

01:18:27.827 --> 01:18:29.034
She felt on the outs.

01:18:29.068 --> 01:18:32.103
We welcomed her with open arms
Some we're not concerned about.

01:18:32.137 --> 01:18:33.310
Her feeling in the middle.

01:18:33.344 --> 01:18:36.620
So david, you had to
Discuss the idea of a true.

01:18:36.655 --> 01:18:38.965
Deadlock tie in which you would
Force a rock draw.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.413
Yeah, and, you know, I'm
Someone who has been to rocks.

01:18:42.448 --> 01:18:44.068
I go to rocks for my people.

01:18:44.103 --> 01:18:47.206
If it has to come to rocks
Tonight, then that's exactly.

01:18:47.241 --> 01:18:48.034
What's going to happen.

01:18:48.068 --> 01:18:49.689
Nobody here is afraid to do
That.

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:50.896
We trust each other.

01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:54.379
Victoria, when you
Hear a veteran say, I will.

01:18:54.413 --> 01:18:57.931
Go to rocks, check my history,
Does that have any weight with.

01:18:57.965 --> 01:18:58.344
You?

01:18:58.379 --> 01:18:59.620
Not really.

01:18:59.655 --> 01:19:03.275
I find it really hard to believe
You would come back into this.

01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:07.827
Game again and again to have
Your fate be put into rocks if.

01:19:07.862 --> 01:19:09.241
You had another option.

01:19:09.275 --> 01:19:13.206
So I get it and I respect it,
But I don't think you played.

01:19:13.241 --> 01:19:16.724
"Survivor" twice, three times to
Go home on a rock before you hit.

01:19:16.758 --> 01:19:17.965
The merge.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.034
Eric, you're nodding, You agree.

01:19:20.068 --> 01:19:22.448
"Survivor" is fun, but it's
Not that fun.

01:19:22.482 --> 01:19:25.965
I don't know if I would do it
Three times to go home on a rock.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.310
Draw.

01:19:30.344 --> 01:19:36.758
Wendy, I would like to talk.

01:19:36.793 --> 01:19:37.724
To you for a quick second.

01:19:37.758 --> 01:19:45.758
Sure, let's go ahead.

01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:01.000
Is that it?

01:20:01.034 --> 01:20:02.413
You guys ready to vote?

01:20:02.448 --> 01:20:03.551
Yep.

01:20:03.586 --> 01:20:04.931
We're ready.

01:20:04.965 --> 01:20:05.448
All right.

01:20:05.482 --> 01:20:06.172
It is time to vote.

01:20:06.206 --> 01:20:10.000
Wentworth, you're up.

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:48.620
I'll go tally the Votes.

01:20:50.103 --> 01:20:52.493
If anybody has a hidden immunity
Idol and you want to play it,

01:20:52.517 --> 01:21:00.517
Now would be the time to do so.

01:21:01.758 --> 01:21:02.517
Okay.

01:21:02.551 --> 01:21:06.827
I'll read the votes.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:11.241
First vote, wendy.

01:21:11.275 --> 01:21:15.206

01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:19.517
That's two votes wendy.

01:21:19.551 --> 01:21:20.655

Three votes wendy, three votes

01:21:35.862 --> 01:21:37.034
Wendy.

01:21:37.068 --> 01:21:45.068
That's four votes wendy, three
Votes lauren, one vote left.

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:46.448
Lauren.

01:21:46.482 --> 01:21:49.517
We're tied.

01:21:49.551 --> 01:21:50.482
Here's what's going to happen.

01:21:50.517 --> 01:21:52.517
We're going to revote.

01:21:52.551 --> 01:21:55.344
Lauren and wendy, you will not
Vote.

01:21:55.379 --> 01:22:03.379
Everybody else you can only vote
For lauren or wendy.Ñr.

01:22:05.413 --> 01:22:13.413
Everybody else you can only vote
For lauren or wendy.Ñr.

01:22:15.172 --> 01:22:17.379
I just want to say one thing.

01:22:17.413 --> 01:22:19.758
Once we merge, we just met you.

01:22:19.793 --> 01:22:21.586
This is our first conversation.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.379
I know, I know.

01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:29.379
Our group is going to cave.

01:22:37.103 --> 01:22:41.344
This is like the worst
Cocktail party ever.

01:22:41.379 --> 01:22:42.551
Okay.

01:22:42.586 --> 01:22:46.586
Wentworth, come grab the urn.

01:23:07.793 --> 01:23:14.758
I'll go tally the votes.

01:23:16.586 --> 01:23:20.620
I'll read the votes.

01:23:20.655 --> 01:23:24.724
Wendy.

01:23:24.758 --> 01:23:25.379
Wendy.

01:23:25.413 --> 01:23:29.827
Two votes wendy.

01:23:29.862 --> 01:23:30.517
Wendy.

01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:35.758
Three votes wendy.

01:23:35.793 --> 01:23:39.172
Sixth person voted out of
"Survivor Edge of extinction,"

01:23:39.206 --> 01:23:39.827
Wendy.

01:23:39.862 --> 01:23:40.551
That's four, that's enough.

01:23:40.586 --> 01:23:41.965
You need to bring me your torch.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.034
Sorry, wendy.

01:23:44.068 --> 01:23:44.620
Sorry.

01:23:44.655 --> 01:23:51.551
It's cool, it's cool.

01:23:51.586 --> 01:23:54.827
Can you call me big wendy?

01:23:54.862 --> 01:23:56.241
You're amazing.

01:23:56.275 --> 01:23:57.689
The tribe has spoken.

01:23:57.724 --> 01:24:03.172
Yeah.

01:24:03.206 --> 01:24:03.793
Bye, guys.

01:24:03.827 --> 01:24:04.517
I get a hug.

01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:06.275
We'll miss you, wendy.

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:07.862
We really well.

01:24:07.896 --> 01:24:08.344
