[screams]

00:23.291 --> 00:25.260
[Poison Ivy] Gotcha!

00:25.294 --> 00:28.661
I'm not great at having people
who are actually good to me
in my life.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.045
Same. Most people are trash.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.701
Wouldn't it be messed up
if I ate you right now?

00:34.734 --> 00:39.073
[both laughing]

00:39.106 --> 00:43.277
-[groans]
-Ive!

00:43.310 --> 00:46.460
[Poison Ivy groaning]

00:49.350 --> 00:50.951
Ive, don't leave me.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.820
We still got so much
ass-kicking to do.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.956
Harley...

00:55.990 --> 00:57.189
I can't.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.448
[sobbing]

01:10.203 --> 01:11.971
[Joker laughing]

01:11.971 --> 01:12.740
Oops!

01:12.740 --> 01:15.740
[laughing continues]

01:17.778 --> 01:20.748
[laughing continues]

01:20.781 --> 01:23.180
[laughing fades]

01:26.887 --> 01:31.091
Harley, uh, a few words?

01:31.125 --> 01:33.227
[stifled sobs]

01:33.260 --> 01:36.563
Let her grieve.
I've prepared
a little something.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.965
[clearing throat]

01:37.998 --> 01:39.667
-[Harley sobbing]
-We have gathered today

01:39.700 --> 01:42.503
to pay respects
to our beloved friend.

01:42.537 --> 01:45.439
Her death was not
an empty sacrifice.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.575
And, of my friend,
I will say just this.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.146
Of all the souls
I have met
on my journeys,

01:52.179 --> 01:54.581
hers was the most...

01:54.615 --> 01:56.450
-human. [sobs]
-[Harley sobbing]

01:56.483 --> 01:58.918
Wow, that, uh... [sniffles]
Wasn't awful.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.921
As apropos a speech now

02:00.954 --> 02:02.423
as when it was
originally delivered

02:02.456 --> 02:05.959
by William Shatner's
Captain James Tiberius Kirk

02:05.992 --> 02:08.895
in <i>Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan.</i>

02:08.929 --> 02:13.729
[Dr. Psycho] Mmm-hmm.
All right.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.804
[Frank sobbing]

02:16.836 --> 02:20.074
Goodbye, my dear fiancee.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.356
[Frank wailing]

02:25.913 --> 02:27.647
Who's gonna water my roots?

02:27.681 --> 02:29.349
[sobbing]

02:29.383 --> 02:33.753
I don't trust
any of these assholes.

02:33.753 --> 02:34.754
[Harley sobs]

02:34.754 --> 02:36.776
You'll be missed.

02:39.725 --> 02:41.975
[Harley crying]

02:50.771 --> 02:55.771
She's a doctor, damn it!
Who chiseled this shit?

03:11.792 --> 03:15.295
[screaming]

03:15.329 --> 03:17.264
No, no, no.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.766
What're ya...
What are you doin'?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.868
He doesn't want you
to follow Ivy to the grave.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.038
So that's it? We're just
supposed to sit here
twiddling our thumbs?

03:24.072 --> 03:28.308
Well, unless you got
some kind of actual plan,
I say yes.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.344
Yes. I got one.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.881
Ooh, does it involve
indiscriminate smashing
of other people's property?

03:33.913 --> 03:35.181
-No.
-Aw!

03:35.216 --> 03:37.286
When no one believed
in me, Ivy did.

03:37.318 --> 03:40.420
She always wanted me
to get rid of this asshole,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

03:40.455 --> 03:41.822
Still not a plan.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.655
I'm workin' on one.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.633
Come on, come on.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.235
-Jim, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.637
My marriage is totally fine.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.504
[sighs] I mean
the situation on the street.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.439
Oh, that's a shit show.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.408
Unlike my marriage,
which is rock-solid.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.830
-Right.
-[door opens]

04:02.830 --> 04:05.044
Ugh, what is the point
of having an elevator
if it doesn't work?

04:05.079 --> 04:06.379
Quinn, what are you
doing here?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.250
I wanna take down Joker.

04:08.250 --> 04:10.183
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...
we need to work together.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.384
I work alone.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.419
What about me?

04:12.453 --> 04:13.754
-Not now, Jim.
-[groans]

04:13.788 --> 04:15.622
No one knows Joker
better than you and me.

04:15.657 --> 04:18.593
[breathlessly] I've got a file
on him. I'll be right back.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.461
Look, we put
our heads together,
we can beat him.

04:20.495 --> 04:22.629
And then you can
go back to doing
whatever it is you do.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.333
I'm not teaming up with you.
You should be locked up
in Arkham.

04:25.333 --> 04:28.035
Joker killed Ivy,
took over Gotham,

04:28.067 --> 04:29.735
and cut off your bat nuts!

04:29.769 --> 04:31.538
-Hmm.
-Help me!

04:31.538 --> 04:33.040
You're never gonna
believe this. [panting]

04:33.040 --> 04:34.172
Found Joker's file,

04:34.172 --> 04:36.944
but he replaced it with
one of those greeting cards
that plays music.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.211
[music playing]

04:38.245 --> 04:41.115
What a tricky
son of a so-and-so.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.117
-[laughs]
-If I say yes to this,

04:43.149 --> 04:45.386
what do you bring
to the table, Quinn?

04:45.418 --> 04:49.019
The thing he wants most.

04:51.891 --> 04:55.041

05:11.778 --> 05:13.747

Of course I'm referring to
the "murdering her on purpose."

05:28.629 --> 05:31.365
Oh, I hate you
more than you'll ever know.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.800
But I'm also practical.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.603
You won, and I wanna be
on the winnin' side.

05:35.636 --> 05:39.372

<i>how positively mature of you.</i>

05:39.406 --> 05:40.942
I know, real growth.

05:40.975 --> 05:43.142
I thought maybe we could
patch things up

are you doing?

Think of all you've
accomplished in 38 years.

I'm 25, and you know
how I feel about
champagne corks.

09:31.072 --> 09:32.472
That could've hit me
in the eye.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.573
Sorry about that.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.841
So, what shall we do now, boss?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.378
Maybe we build
a giant maze, yeah?

Dose the people in it
with fear toxin? [chuckling]

[groans] You are so
one note, bag head.

got disruptive, you know
how we'd celebrate?

09:46.687 --> 09:47.988
Uh, fondue?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.823
"Fondue"? No!

09:49.856 --> 09:52.525
By getting more disruptive!

09:52.559 --> 09:54.360
Like kidnapping Gordon
and eating sushi

09:54.394 --> 09:56.898
off his lumpy, naked body.

09:56.931 --> 09:59.299

10:01.635 --> 10:03.004
And now I'm doing this,

10:03.037 --> 10:05.609
which should be tons of fun,
but I'm bored.

10:05.643 --> 10:07.875
What is wrong with me?

10:07.908 --> 10:10.677
You're a sociopathic
narcissist. [screams]

10:10.711 --> 10:12.879
It was rhetorical, asshole!

10:12.913 --> 10:15.448
And who do you think you are,

10:17.985 --> 10:20.053
-What?
-Bloody hell!

10:20.087 --> 10:23.356
[stammers] It's billionaire

[hysterically] No!

Are you shitting me!

10:28.495 --> 10:30.197

10:30.230 --> 10:34.001
Don't you think
I would have done that
had I wanted to?

10:34.034 --> 10:36.839
Half the fun
of our relationship
was the mystery!

10:36.871 --> 10:40.908
Now I know Batman is just
some boring rich asshole
with parental issues.

10:40.942 --> 10:42.476
That's really reductive.

10:42.510 --> 10:44.946
Thanks for ruining
the funnest thing
I had going.

10:44.979 --> 10:47.783
Now I don't even
feel like torturing him.

10:47.816 --> 10:50.618
[stutters] Sorry, I thought
it might be the kind of thing
Harley would do.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.320
I don't care about Harley!

10:52.354 --> 10:55.057
[stammers] I'm sorry, look,
I must've misread the situation

10:55.090 --> 10:58.458
when you kept saying her name
and reminiscing about
all your memories together.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.727
Over and over and over and--

11:00.760 --> 11:02.410
[screaming]

11:06.000 --> 11:08.235
[groans] Not even that was fun.

an electric car by this year.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.573
I put a deposit down.

Where's my goddamn
electric car, Bruce?

The guy at the flower shop
said black roses
don't exist in nature,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.317
so I had to dye these.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.721
Just wanted you to have
a little bit of me
in the ground with ya.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.724
Oh, Ive!
I miss you so much!

11:29.756 --> 11:32.525
If you can hear me,
just give me a sign.

-Harley?

11:34.562 --> 11:37.030
Hey there. I was just
taking a little catnap
back here on the ol' rock.

11:37.065 --> 11:38.566
[stammers] Are you living here?

11:38.566 --> 11:40.033
I don't know
if I'd call this "living."

11:40.033 --> 11:41.601
You're damn right.
I'm an indoor plant.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.738
I'm supposed to get
indirect sunlight.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.740
I just hate the thought
of leaving Ivy alone.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.475
Hey, what...
Why aren't you hiding?

11:48.509 --> 11:51.846
Bounty's up to... Oh, man!
That's a lot of zeros.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.514
But why does he want
your ass alive?

11:53.548 --> 11:56.750
It's obvi. To make her watch
her crew get executed.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.044
Wait, what?

11:58.044 --> 12:01.089
Yeah. He's gonna execute them
and then after,
he's throwing an '80s party.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.390
You don't have to dress up
but it's strongly suggested.

12:03.424 --> 12:06.760
God, so many iconic
'80s looks to choose from.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.198
I wanna go "Thriller"

12:08.198 --> 12:11.164
but I don't wanna be the third
"Thriller" in line for
the potato salad. You feel me?

12:11.164 --> 12:13.033
[Harley] They're doing it
at sundown tonight!

12:13.067 --> 12:14.735
Oh. I'm not gonna
let this happen.

12:14.769 --> 12:17.238
Uh, how are you gonna stop
Joker by yourself

12:17.272 --> 12:19.005
when you couldn't even
do it with Batman?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.042
I don't know.
I need a minute to think.

12:21.075 --> 12:24.644
-One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...
-[Kite Man humming]

12:24.677 --> 12:27.447
-...three Mississippi...
-Can you...

12:27.480 --> 12:28.950
Can you not be here right now?

12:28.982 --> 12:32.086
Like, you want me to
go over by that tree, or...

12:32.120 --> 12:35.255
You know, I know I said
I don't live here,
but I sort of do.

12:35.289 --> 12:40.289
Just give me a sec
with Ive, okay?

12:40.827 --> 12:44.798
Ive, what I'm gonna do
may be a suicide mission.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.134
If I don't see you back here,

12:46.167 --> 12:50.671
maybe I'll see you
on the flip side.

12:50.703 --> 12:55.703
[exhales] All right,
here goes nothing.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.600
[Joker imitating alarm]

13:07.254 --> 13:08.422
Hey!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.024
<i>Oh, hey, Harley.</i>

13:10.057 --> 13:14.128
I was just... [clears throat]
Finishing <i>Infinite Jest.</i>

13:14.162 --> 13:15.629
Are you familiar with it?

13:15.663 --> 13:17.063
Spine looks pretty intact.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.433
[stutters] Well, I have
a digital copy, too.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.537
Anyway, are you here
for the big execution?

13:22.571 --> 13:24.538
<i>There ain't gonna be</i>
<i>an execution.</i>

13:24.572 --> 13:28.043
Flyers say there is.
Right before the live
'80s cover band.

13:28.076 --> 13:30.977
<i>Their version of</i>
<i>"Sweet Child O' Mine"</i>
<i>is...</i> [laughs]

13:31.011 --> 13:33.014
<i>-It's okay.</i>
-Release my friends.

13:33.014 --> 13:37.216
<i>Or what?</i>
<i>I have a whole army</i>
<i>inside this sick-ass tower.</i>

13:37.250 --> 13:38.318
[laughing]

13:38.352 --> 13:40.855
What leg do you have
to stand on?

13:40.888 --> 13:42.822
It seems like
you really want me alive,

13:42.856 --> 13:44.892
so, if you don't
do what I say...

13:44.926 --> 13:49.397
I'm gone.

13:49.431 --> 13:54.431
-[elevator music playing]
-[floor indicator beeping]

13:54.500 --> 13:55.735
[elevator dings]

13:55.769 --> 13:57.404
Welcome to my penthouse.

13:57.438 --> 13:59.774
[laughs] It's got
all the amenities.

13:59.807 --> 14:02.277
Central air, 360-degree views,

14:02.309 --> 14:04.611
and a couple of horny tigers.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.214
[roaring]

14:06.214 --> 14:08.816
What the hell do you
want from me?
Where's my crew?

14:08.849 --> 14:10.985
[chuckling]

14:11.018 --> 14:14.889
I want you to put this on.

14:14.922 --> 14:18.359
[laughing]

14:18.393 --> 14:22.195
Come on, remember
how much fun you had
in that costume?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.130
No.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.798
I didn't have fun.

14:24.798 --> 14:26.700
You were the one having fun.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.470
It wasn't till
I got away from you

14:28.470 --> 14:32.206
that I realized
how deeply <i>un-</i> fun
being with you was.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.476
So I would rather
blow myself up
and take you with me

14:35.509 --> 14:39.279
than go back to being
your sidekick and wearing
that fuckin' costume!

14:39.313 --> 14:42.182
Well, you could.
Certainly an option.

14:42.216 --> 14:44.985
Only fly in the ointment is
if you blow yourself up,

14:45.019 --> 14:47.520
-you'll take your crew
with you.
-[beeps, whirs]

14:47.553 --> 14:50.557
[Joker laughing]

14:50.591 --> 14:54.861
So, how about
you make this easy and put...

14:54.894 --> 14:56.897
the outfit...

14:56.931 --> 14:58.533
on.

14:58.566 --> 14:59.933
-[Clayface, King Shark, Sy]
Don't do it.
-Do it.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.802
So, I put this on,
you let them go?

15:02.836 --> 15:06.472
And if you don't...
[laughing]

15:06.506 --> 15:08.307
I kill them.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.816
[chuckles] Oh, there she is!

15:15.850 --> 15:17.820
Harley Quinn original recipe.

15:17.854 --> 15:20.754
Why'd you have to go
and mess with a classic?

15:20.788 --> 15:23.124
Are you gonna let
my crew go, or what?

15:23.157 --> 15:24.750
I'm a man of my word.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.750
Buh-bye.

15:25.759 --> 15:26.994
[crew screaming]

15:27.028 --> 15:29.596
[distant screams continue]

15:29.629 --> 15:30.931
[groans]

15:30.965 --> 15:35.965
She gave her life
so that we may live.

15:36.136 --> 15:40.375
[tearfully] Goodbye, Harley.

15:40.408 --> 15:43.510
Okay, I'm in the costume.
So what's the plan?

15:43.544 --> 15:45.547
Want me to make you
a chocolate cake,

15:45.580 --> 15:49.384
-put on <i>Legally Blonde,</i>
call you "puddin'"?
-[laughing]

15:49.417 --> 15:51.653
Harley, I've got the city
by the balls.

15:51.686 --> 15:53.823
The cops are mine.
Batman's tied up and gagged.

15:53.856 --> 15:57.591
I have everything
a man could want.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.926
But I'm not happy.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.528
And do you know why?

16:00.562 --> 16:03.464
Because you're a textbook
sociopathic narcissist

16:03.498 --> 16:07.100
with a chemical imbalance
in your parasympathetic
nervous system?

16:07.134 --> 16:09.035
Hey, that's what Batman said.

16:09.070 --> 16:11.307
Hey, Batman,
she said the thing you said.

16:11.341 --> 16:14.743
Anyway, no. The reason
I wasn't happy

16:14.775 --> 16:17.110
was because
we weren't together.

16:17.144 --> 16:20.114
It wasn't until
I got everything...

16:20.147 --> 16:22.615
that I realized
it means nothing

16:22.649 --> 16:24.551
without you by my side.

16:24.585 --> 16:25.854
Really?

16:25.854 --> 16:28.288
Harley, you're the missing
piece to my happiness.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.191
I knew you'd be back.

16:30.224 --> 16:33.860
I guess I could never
stay away from my puddin'.

16:33.894 --> 16:35.697
-[stabbing]
-[both grunting]

16:35.730 --> 16:39.600
You were always so unoriginal,
stealing my ideas.

16:39.633 --> 16:43.533
Fuck you! This is for Ivy.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.142
Ha!

16:48.176 --> 16:50.426
[both grunting]

16:54.148 --> 16:56.917
[Joker laughs]

16:56.951 --> 16:58.301
[roaring]

17:08.695 --> 17:09.797
[yelping]

17:09.829 --> 17:12.532
[Joker laughing]

17:12.566 --> 17:14.501
[screaming]

17:14.536 --> 17:16.804
Did you really think
I was gonna believe
that bullshit

17:16.836 --> 17:19.105
about me being
the missing piece?

17:19.140 --> 17:22.343
[chuckles]
But that was all true!

17:22.376 --> 17:25.346
You see, I only have
one weakness. You.

17:25.346 --> 17:29.083
And when you're the most
powerful man in the world,
there's no room for weakness.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.984
And so, my only option

17:31.018 --> 17:33.721
is to... [chuckling]
Get rid of you.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.057
Then do it. Kill me!

17:36.089 --> 17:39.926
[laughs] Do you take me
for a basic bitch?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.528
If I were I to kill you,

17:41.563 --> 17:45.266
you'd live on forever,
an emotional martyr in my soul.

17:45.298 --> 17:49.237
So I'm going to erase you
from existence.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.772
Pick her up. Follow me.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.875
[Harley grunts]

17:55.910 --> 17:58.511
[bubbling]

17:58.511 --> 17:59.513
[gasps, strains]

17:59.547 --> 18:01.648
I made the mistake
of creating you,

18:01.682 --> 18:03.651
and now I'm going to
undo that mistake.

18:03.684 --> 18:08.055
This acid will erase all that
makes you Harley Quinn.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.224
You'll be a nobody.
A blank canvas.

18:11.259 --> 18:14.493
A stranger on the streets.
[chuckling]

18:14.528 --> 18:15.561
Normal.

18:15.596 --> 18:16.865
Don't do this.

18:16.897 --> 18:19.034
If you wanna kill me, kill me,
but don't do this!

18:19.034 --> 18:24.034
Should've thought of that
before you made me
fall in love with you.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.044
[Joker] It's time.
But don't worry,

18:30.076 --> 18:32.046
you won't remember a thing.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.513
[gasps softly]

18:34.548 --> 18:36.049
Let me jump.

18:36.083 --> 18:38.885
Let this last act
of Harley Quinn be my own.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.454
You owe me at least that.

18:40.488 --> 18:44.238
[chuckles] Sure. Go nuts.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.365
Goodbye, Harley Quinn.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.734
[bubbling continues]

18:53.768 --> 18:55.638
Wait a minute.
Did anyone hear a splash?

18:55.672 --> 18:59.606
I've fallen in acid
enough times to know that
there should be a splash.

18:59.641 --> 19:01.842
You're right
about that, puddin'.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.144
How did you...

19:03.176 --> 19:05.612
Wait. Where are
those vines coming from?

19:05.645 --> 19:06.996
Oh, fuck.

19:22.163 --> 19:25.333
I knew I should've
harpooned you in the head!

19:25.333 --> 19:26.701
One in the head,
one in the heart.

19:26.701 --> 19:29.135
It's Harpooning 101.

19:29.170 --> 19:32.105
[both scream]

19:32.138 --> 19:34.307
-Guess who's next?
-[grunts]

19:34.342 --> 19:37.044
Harley... [chuckling]
You don't wanna do this.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.046
We can rule Gotham together.

19:39.046 --> 19:40.814
[laughing hysterically]

19:40.847 --> 19:42.482
You're nothing without me!

19:42.482 --> 19:44.853
You always tried to make me
think that, but it's not true!

19:44.885 --> 19:47.087
I have friends that love
and care about me.

19:47.122 --> 19:50.089
I'm moving on with my life
with the people that matter.

19:50.124 --> 19:51.959
And that ain't you, puddin'.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.060
-Drop him.
-Love to.

19:54.094 --> 19:56.096
[whimpering] You don't
want to do this.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.199
I've always supported
strong female

19:58.231 --> 20:01.832
friendships! [screaming]

20:11.077 --> 20:13.213
Oh, Ive! Oh, my God!

20:13.247 --> 20:15.383
It was my tears, wasn't it?

20:15.415 --> 20:16.817
My tears of friendship

20:16.851 --> 20:19.186
fell on your grave
and brought you back to life!

20:19.221 --> 20:22.589
Harls, I love you,
but we don't live
in a Disney movie, okay?

20:22.624 --> 20:26.094
It was the renewing power
of nature that brought me back.

20:26.127 --> 20:31.127
And, you know,
maybe the tears
helped a little, too.

20:31.832 --> 20:33.481
[screaming]

20:42.643 --> 20:44.292
[straining]

20:56.990 --> 20:59.192
Oh, my God, he saved us.

20:59.226 --> 21:01.028
He'll be okay, right?
I mean, he's Batman.

21:01.061 --> 21:04.097
[uncertainly] Sure.
I mean, you know,
he's got the polymer suit

21:04.131 --> 21:05.333
-with the--
-[loud crashing]

21:05.365 --> 21:07.465
Oh, shit.
Let's get out of here.

21:11.005 --> 21:12.567
[woman screams]

21:20.213 --> 21:23.116
[screaming]

21:23.150 --> 21:25.849
[Joker's laughter]

21:30.125 --> 21:33.627
So, to summarize, good news,
Joker no longer rules Gotham.

21:33.661 --> 21:36.230
Bad news,
thanks to an 8.6 earthquake,

21:36.262 --> 21:38.265
there's no longer
a Gotham left to rule.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.932
And Batman is missing.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.868
More updates as we get them.

21:41.902 --> 21:45.352
[distant siren wailing]

21:48.175 --> 21:50.377
[Dr. Psycho] And I just want
the record to reflect

21:50.411 --> 21:52.278
that I always
had faith in you, Harley.

21:52.313 --> 21:53.948
Did not doubt it for a moment.

21:53.948 --> 21:57.884
I did not feel the same way,
but am so glad I was wrong.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.153
Harls, ya did it.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.721
Justice League is gone,

22:00.755 --> 22:03.123
same with the Legion of Doom,
and the Joker's dead.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.492
Gotham is in complete chaos.

22:05.526 --> 22:09.576
[Harley] It's so beautiful.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.768
[distant siren wailing]

22:14.800 --> 22:18.305
[Joker laughing]

22:18.338 --> 22:21.189
[laughter subsides]

22:24.211 --> 22:25.444
[theme music playing]
