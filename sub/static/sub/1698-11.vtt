00:00.910 --> 00:02.830
Hey, I'm Jason Earles from Hannah Montana.

00:04.350 --> 00:05.850
And you're watching Disney Channel.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.070
Who wants the last "achey breaky,"

00:16.079 --> 00:19.600
"everybody wakey," "do a little shakey" pancakey?

00:20.640 --> 00:22.960
You've already had two, piggy!

00:23.200 --> 00:24.010
Oh, wow!

00:24.160 --> 00:25.660
I didn't know you could count that high.

00:25.880 --> 00:26.980
Now give it!

00:27.240 --> 00:28.640
I'm still a growing boy!

00:28.900 --> 00:30.800
Not since the fourth grade you're not.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.810
Now hand it over!

00:31.820 --> 00:32.420
All right.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.200
Your mom wanted kids. I wanted dogs.

00:36.180 --> 00:37.480
I still want dogs.

00:38.470 --> 00:39.570
Now work it out.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.750
You're right. Jackson?

00:42.610 --> 00:44.110
I have a simple solution.

00:46.610 --> 00:47.510
Ha!

00:48.910 --> 00:49.710
Ha!

00:50.790 --> 00:53.590
Sixteen years and still making rookie mistakes!

00:57.070 --> 00:59.370
Dad, how about I make you a little deal?

00:59.440 --> 01:01.130
We move. Don't say where we're going

01:01.130 --> 01:02.320
and I'll get you any dog you want.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.569
Darling you say that now but

01:04.769 --> 01:06.570
When he goes away to College,

01:06.580 --> 01:08.770
I guarantee you're going to miss him.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.390
And Jackson says you're not funny!

01:12.620 --> 01:15.520
You know your Uncle Earl and I, we used to fight all the time.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.220
When he went away to College

01:17.270 --> 01:19.730
those were the four saddest days of my life.

01:20.110 --> 01:21.310
Dad, I can honestly tell you,

01:21.350 --> 01:23.910
I am not going to miss that pancake poaching,

01:23.920 --> 01:25.380
syrup stealing mud crunkie!

01:25.980 --> 01:28.680
Honey, I know your brother's got a lot of faults.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.280
One of them being that he don't think I'm funny.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.880
Let's face it. My Scooby Doo is way better than his.

01:34.910 --> 01:36.010
Rippo Rolly (Miley)

01:36.530 --> 01:39.130
Zoyce (Yes), that's hilarious.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.660
Anyway, the point is you're brother and sister.

01:42.930 --> 01:45.730
For me, please. Just try and work it out.

01:46.330 --> 01:49.830
OK Fine. I'll try it. Just for you.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.140
Let go of my tights!

01:54.160 --> 01:57.230
Not until you apologize for ruining

01:57.230 --> 01:58.660
my razor on those sandpaper legs!

01:59.870 --> 02:02.270
Or did you use it to mow your girlstache!

02:02.490 --> 02:04.590
Well, at least I can grow a stache.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.580
Now let go! You're ruining them.

02:07.240 --> 02:11.140
Dangflabit! Can't a man bleach his teeth in peace around here?

02:12.250 --> 02:13.650
He started it!

02:17.210 --> 02:18.210
Ooopsie.

02:22.090 --> 02:24.190
Son? You OK?

02:24.240 --> 02:25.640
Ow my head!

02:25.660 --> 02:28.060
You're head? My tights!

02:29.830 --> 02:31.030
Who are you, guys?

02:31.060 --> 02:32.460
Very funny, Jackson.

02:32.710 --> 02:33.910
Who's Jackson?

02:35.800 --> 02:38.400
Oh Sweet Pete, I think he's serious!

02:38.700 --> 02:39.900
Who's Sweet Pete?

02:40.630 --> 02:42.230
Oh, my gosh! I don't know anything!

02:42.620 --> 02:43.720
OK now, let's not panic.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.000
It's not like he knew that much before.

02:55.910 --> 02:58.410
You get the limo out front.

02:59.990 --> 03:03.290
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

03:03.460 --> 03:06.860
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

03:07.340 --> 03:11.640
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

03:12.140 --> 03:15.540
Who would've thought that a girl like me

03:15.640 --> 03:21.040
would double as a superstar?

03:21.480 --> 03:25.580
You get the best of both worlds.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.520
Chill it out, take it slow,

03:27.620 --> 03:29.320
then you rock out the show.

03:29.320 --> 03:33.320
You get the best of both worlds.

03:33.610 --> 03:36.210
Mix it all together and you know that

03:36.220 --> 03:38.730
It's the best of both worlds.

03:39.210 --> 03:43.000
Hannah Montana S03E11
Knock, Knock, Knockin' on Jackson's Head

03:43.680 --> 03:45.000
They have been gone for two hours.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.180
What is taking them so long!

03:46.310 --> 03:47.310
I know what it is.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.390
The doctors have never seen a brain as small as Jackson's.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.740
They probably want to do some experiments on it.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.500
Put it in a jar or something.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.620
Lilly, this is serious!

03:57.400 --> 03:58.800
And besides, it wouldn't be a jar.

03:58.910 --> 04:01.010
Be more like a this little thimble.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.100
Well, we're waiting on some test results

04:06.190 --> 04:07.590
But it looks like amnesia.

04:07.790 --> 04:08.990
The good news is

04:09.460 --> 04:10.960
It only lasts a few weeks.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.810
He really doesn't remember anything?

04:14.860 --> 04:17.000
Well, he remembers some things

04:17.000 --> 04:19.360
but others are a complete blank.

04:21.089 --> 04:21.990
Watch!

04:23.210 --> 04:26.310
Jackson, who is the first President of the United States?

04:26.520 --> 04:27.820
George Washington?

04:27.900 --> 04:29.000
And who am I?

04:29.950 --> 04:31.050
George Washington?

04:32.580 --> 04:33.680
I'm your father!

04:33.860 --> 04:35.660
My father is George Washington?

04:36.040 --> 04:41.140
NO! Your father is Robby Ray Stewart!

04:42.360 --> 04:44.060
Why is she yelling at me, George?

04:44.550 --> 04:45.450
Boy!

04:47.130 --> 04:49.830
Wait! Do you remember who I am?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.600
My... girlfriend?

04:51.990 --> 04:54.090
What...What...What?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.040
No, no. I am your sister.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.360
Lilly, please hit me over the head

04:57.370 --> 04:58.340
so I'll forget he ever said that.

04:59.660 --> 05:01.410
Are ... you my girlfriend?

05:01.430 --> 05:02.890
No, no.

05:02.980 --> 05:07.680
Eh see.. You don't have a girlfriend!

05:07.830 --> 05:09.630
Make her stop yelling at me, George!

05:10.210 --> 05:13.810
I got an idea! Why don't I get a few family-momentos.

05:13.820 --> 05:17.580
A few photos, see if I can jog his memory just a little bit.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.320
I know what I'mma do it!

05:19.510 --> 05:22.810
Dad, please do not get out that stinkin' old mullet again!

05:22.860 --> 05:24.560
I am not doing it for me,

05:24.560 --> 05:27.450
I am doing it for the health and well-being of my son!

05:27.910 --> 05:30.910
Heyo mullet, Pappa is taking you for a ride

05:38.450 --> 05:41.050
So, you really don't remember anything about us?

05:41.260 --> 05:43.160
Sorry... but I know that you are my sister,

05:43.210 --> 05:44.510
'cause that's what you told me.

05:45.210 --> 05:46.510
Is there anything else you could tell me?

05:46.530 --> 05:47.690
Like... do we get along?

05:47.820 --> 05:50.120
Get along? Are you kidding?

05:51.010 --> 05:52.110
You...

05:54.170 --> 05:56.270
wash up the ground I walk on.

05:56.670 --> 05:57.780
Oh, OK!

05:58.170 --> 05:59.270
Excuse us for a second.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.790
Are you sure you wanna do this?

06:01.860 --> 06:03.860
Come on! Dad says it's only for a few weeks.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.220
Why don't we have a little fun?

06:05.860 --> 06:06.970
Hey, by the way

06:07.450 --> 06:09.440
You love making my bed, vaccuming my room

06:09.550 --> 06:10.830
and making me breakfast.

06:12.260 --> 06:14.060
Oh, oh oh oh, and eh...

06:14.650 --> 06:16.050
You owe me twenty bucks!

06:22.010 --> 06:24.010
What? You can do it and I can't?

06:28.700 --> 06:31.500
In triangle A B and C if A and B are acute angles

06:31.510 --> 06:33.340
and sine A equals ten over thirteen

06:33.340 --> 06:34.680
what's the value of cosine A?

06:35.480 --> 06:37.880
What kind of alien mutant mind would know that!

06:38.080 --> 06:42.150
8.306328662918075

06:43.510 --> 06:44.710
Over thirteen.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.920
Hey Rico, do you want to help me with my...

06:49.920 --> 06:50.850
Forget it!

06:51.190 --> 06:52.490
I've got my own problems.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.310
My cousin Angus is coming from Australia.

06:55.410 --> 06:57.010
You have a cousin named Angus?

06:57.300 --> 06:58.200
His real name is

06:58.200 --> 07:00.700
Alejandro Nunes Gonzales Umberto Sifuentes

07:01.360 --> 07:02.660
Why do you call him Angus?

07:03.140 --> 07:04.390
Because it's easier than calling him

07:04.400 --> 07:06.830
Alejandro Nunes Gonzales Umberto Sifuentes

07:08.630 --> 07:09.830
I hate it when he visits!

07:10.190 --> 07:11.390
Obnoxious jerk.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.450
All he ever does is one up me.

07:13.710 --> 07:16.410
I catch a fish, he wrestles an alligator.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.550
I'm voted model student of the month,

07:19.690 --> 07:22.090
he's voted Australia's swim suit model of the year!

07:22.960 --> 07:24.260
G'day mate!

07:26.590 --> 07:28.590
And the torture begins!

07:30.100 --> 07:31.500
Hey Hey, he looks just like ...

07:31.610 --> 07:32.710
Yeah yeah. I know.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.280
He's gorgeous don't rub it in.

07:36.550 --> 07:38.510
Excuse me, love.

07:38.530 --> 07:40.970
Cricket's Ricky, it's good to see ya!

07:41.210 --> 07:43.010
Yeah yeah, you too, Alejandro.

07:43.110 --> 07:45.710
And that shirt... Crickey!

07:45.970 --> 07:48.570
I love the way how you don't give a dingle about how you look!

07:48.890 --> 07:49.990
Good on ya, mate!

07:50.470 --> 07:53.350
Yeah? Well, I'm I'm kinda busy here

07:53.360 --> 07:56.410
with my very successful beach front bistro.

07:59.380 --> 08:00.680
Right.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.780
Well, whenever you can pull yourself away

08:04.060 --> 08:06.460
you've gotta grab some grub with me and my sweetie!

08:08.620 --> 08:09.820
Auhh, here she is now!

08:11.730 --> 08:13.030
Oh, she's pretty...

08:15.720 --> 08:17.720
Pr.. probably not very bright.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.960
Cous, I'd like you to meet Barbie!

08:22.050 --> 08:22.750
Hi!

08:23.050 --> 08:23.720
Hi.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.580
Yeah. Well, I'd like you to meet my sweetie

08:29.370 --> 08:30.170
Lilly

08:30.310 --> 08:31.110
What?

08:32.960 --> 08:34.760
Yep. I'm a little love monkey.

08:34.850 --> 08:35.850
Love what?

08:36.840 --> 08:38.140
Want a math tutor or not?

08:40.090 --> 08:42.789
Argh we're free tomorrow after school if

08:43.590 --> 08:46.290
that's okay with you... love monkey.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.520
Dad! How long does it take you to put on a hat and mustache?

08:56.900 --> 08:59.000
I got the limo out front hottest styles every show every...

08:59.000 --> 09:00.220
let's go already!

09:01.110 --> 09:04.210
There she is. The prettiest sister in the whole world

09:04.330 --> 09:06.730
And the greatest pop star ever.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.180
Oh... you're so sweet.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.410
You know what else is sweet?

09:09.480 --> 09:09.650
Hemm!

09:09.920 --> 09:12.720
You favorite pre-concert stra-nana berry protein milkshake!

09:12.900 --> 09:13.800
Yay!

09:13.890 --> 09:15.890
Just like you told me I've been making for years.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.040
Just trying to jog the old memory!

09:19.650 --> 09:21.850
It may just be a hat and a mustache to you...

09:22.160 --> 09:23.910
But to me it's my entire disguise

09:23.910 --> 09:25.260
and I take it very seriously!

09:27.980 --> 09:31.480
Whoa wee! Who is that handsome devil?

09:34.010 --> 09:34.610
Napkin me.

09:35.130 --> 09:36.690
Anything for you my goddess.

09:38.330 --> 09:39.330
My goddess?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.020
Yeah. That's my nickname for her.

09:41.530 --> 09:42.930
At least that's what it said in my diary.

09:44.720 --> 09:45.420
His diary?

09:45.610 --> 09:47.910
Yeah. I was up all night writing it!

09:48.280 --> 09:49.580
You know I was just... trying to

09:49.740 --> 09:51.940
Help him remember the person that he was

09:52.730 --> 09:53.630
Or should've been.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.460
Miley, you might not want to...

09:56.470 --> 09:59.070
Don't worry I threw a little something in there for you too.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.220
Look, try out the old scoobie.

10:01.570 --> 10:02.310
He doesn't like my scoobie.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.240
Trust me.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.170
Wooo Woo, Jackson!

10:09.730 --> 10:11.130
My diary was right!

10:11.900 --> 10:14.100
Your scooby is genius!

10:15.130 --> 10:17.530
See! And you said he couldn't be changed.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.120
Travel mug, please.

10:19.250 --> 10:22.850
Done and done. Oh most awesomest divine delight of my life.

10:24.870 --> 10:26.870
Divine delight of my life?

10:27.070 --> 10:29.670
Let me guess. Your diary.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.410
He got it word for word!

10:31.580 --> 10:33.680
His memory just keeps getting better and better!

10:39.080 --> 10:41.680
"My Rico is the love monkey

10:41.690 --> 10:46.210
who carries me off into a magical jungle of romance?"

10:47.650 --> 10:48.650
I can't say this

10:48.990 --> 10:51.790
I got last nights lasagne coming up just thinking about it.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.260
And I hope you like flunking math?!

10:54.950 --> 10:57.160
You're an evil little monkey, aren't you!

10:57.550 --> 10:59.050
And loving it!

11:01.840 --> 11:05.340
Oh look, it's the Rico blackmail dance.

11:05.470 --> 11:06.570
What's he got on you?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.510
I have to pretend to be Rico's girlfriend

11:09.510 --> 11:11.300
so he'll tutor me in math.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.260
Been there.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.320
But, if it helps at all

11:16.760 --> 11:18.330
My life is fantastic!

11:18.610 --> 11:19.710
That helps me how?

11:20.190 --> 11:22.490
Well, good morning Selfish-Sally!

11:23.940 --> 11:25.850
Jackson's amnesia is the best thing

11:25.850 --> 11:26.740
that is ever happened to me.

11:26.970 --> 11:30.040
This morning he made me breakfest, cleaned my room

11:30.050 --> 11:32.200
and made my bed... all while my nails dried.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.120
He did your nails?

11:33.220 --> 11:35.920
Both sets and he pumiced, feel my heels

11:37.470 --> 11:39.070
Like a baby's butt, huh?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.900
Oh my gosh. Look, it's Gabe Lamotti!

11:44.080 --> 11:46.480
Huh? Hottie Lamotti with the swimmers body?

11:48.130 --> 11:49.530
Oh my gosh, he is looking at me!

11:49.650 --> 11:52.050
I have been making subtle hints for two years!

11:52.190 --> 11:55.000
OK, Totally messing up his name every time you talk to him

11:55.000 --> 11:56.270
is not a subtle hint.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.380
I do not do that!

12:00.890 --> 12:01.690
Hey Miley!

12:01.960 --> 12:04.560
Hottie ... Gottie ... body ... Gabe.

12:06.270 --> 12:06.910
How you doing?

12:06.930 --> 12:09.830
Good, I am so good. I am so good!

12:10.320 --> 12:13.320
So you argh... feel like taking a walk on the beach?

12:13.430 --> 12:14.330
That would be so...

12:14.420 --> 12:14.820
Good?

12:14.990 --> 12:16.290
Good, yeah, good.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.260
There you are!

12:19.870 --> 12:22.670
Left the house without your sunscreen, silly girl!

12:23.010 --> 12:24.310
Ah,I think I'm covered.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.690
Not yet you aren't.

12:25.690 --> 12:27.920
I wouldn't want my little sis to get burned.

12:28.090 --> 12:29.890
And speaking of getting burned

12:31.340 --> 12:32.140
You are...

12:32.590 --> 12:34.190
Argh... I'm Gabe.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.460
Grade point average?

12:35.480 --> 12:36.080
Twenty-two.

12:36.230 --> 12:37.530
Any plans for College?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.440
Not yet.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.340
Career goals?

12:39.380 --> 12:40.380
I'm only sixteen!

12:40.410 --> 12:40.710
Get out!

12:40.770 --> 12:41.370
What!

12:41.480 --> 12:42.780
I said get out, Mister Man!

12:44.240 --> 12:46.740
Listen, I'll catch you later, Miley.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.440
No! No! No!

12:51.670 --> 12:52.570
You!

12:52.880 --> 12:54.680
I know that was close, wasn't it?

12:54.730 --> 12:56.250
But don't worry from now on

12:56.510 --> 13:00.000
Gabey Baby and any other seemingly perfect male specimen

13:00.030 --> 13:01.530
will never get near you again.

13:02.890 --> 13:03.690
Never?

13:04.090 --> 13:06.290
Ever! Now let me get those ears!

13:13.230 --> 13:15.520
Here's your lunch, grilled ham and cheese

13:15.520 --> 13:16.930
cut in the shape of a heart!

13:18.270 --> 13:19.470
Cause I love you!

13:21.000 --> 13:22.200
Go away!

13:22.590 --> 13:25.390
Oh, don't worry, I used soy cheese

13:25.610 --> 13:28.110
You know how dairy cheese makes the Miley-train go.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.280
Toot Toot!

13:30.270 --> 13:32.670
Hey Lilly, don't you look cute as a button!

13:34.200 --> 13:35.600
He is suffocating me!

13:37.700 --> 13:40.600
Yeah! Well I'd still take your amnesia brother over

13:40.670 --> 13:44.870
evil little monkey bug, yukety-yuck, gross, disgusting...

13:46.030 --> 13:49.130
Slimy, repulsive, bottom-feeding, ferret-faced little math freak.

13:49.590 --> 13:51.590
Well other than that, hubba-hubba right?

13:53.070 --> 13:56.280
Hey Miley, we got kind of interrupted yesterday.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.580
Babe... Gabe... Hi!

13:58.770 --> 14:00.870
Babe... Gabe... Bye!

14:01.330 --> 14:03.130
Your handsome is not welcome here.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.970
Wow. No... no girl is worth this

14:07.780 --> 14:09.780
Yeah, Yeah, just keep on walking

14:09.820 --> 14:13.430
and that goes for every b-slide babe magnet in this school.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.070
That means you and you...

14:15.610 --> 14:16.710
Not so much you...

14:16.790 --> 14:17.190
But...

14:19.210 --> 14:21.010
But wait till you see the guy that I found for you.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.890
It's nose-whistle Wallie!

14:27.860 --> 14:28.660
Hi, Miley!

14:32.100 --> 14:35.300
4.1 pre-accepted into harvard and he comes from money.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.680
I'll call you later.

14:41.170 --> 14:42.470
Can I pick 'em or what?

14:48.820 --> 14:49.620
Aha.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.920
The new Jackson is ruining my life!

14:53.350 --> 14:54.980
I swear if the Doctor hadn't said

14:54.980 --> 14:56.250
the amnesia was only temporary,

14:56.540 --> 14:59.440
I would create a third identity just to get away from him!

15:00.640 --> 15:04.140
Or a red head this time! Curly maybe...

15:05.540 --> 15:07.540
OK. Thanks, Doc.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.540
Well. You might want to go wig shopping.

15:11.150 --> 15:12.950
The doctor just gave me the test results.

15:14.020 --> 15:16.420
It says this could possibly last for years.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.400
Years?

15:17.820 --> 15:18.920
Possibly forever.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.130
Daddy who better be ready to catch me say what?

15:21.910 --> 15:22.210
What?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.900
Everybody let's chill.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.190
Do the ice cream freeze

15:29.260 --> 15:30.160
Strike your pose

15:30.210 --> 15:31.310
Then you do the milkshake

15:31.360 --> 15:32.460
Shake it shake it down low

15:32.510 --> 15:34.610
Do the snow cone slide, left to right

15:34.680 --> 15:35.860
Put your hands in the air

15:35.900 --> 15:37.000
We could party all night

15:37.010 --> 15:38.110
Do the ice cream freeze

15:38.350 --> 15:39.210
Strike your pose

15:39.850 --> 15:42.190
I love you, Hannah Montana!

15:42.700 --> 15:44.000
She's my sister

15:45.060 --> 15:45.860
Jackson

15:46.040 --> 15:46.640
Hold on sis.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.640
It's my Hannah Montana power hour.

15:49.090 --> 15:51.490
You are amazing!

15:52.210 --> 15:54.610
And you... are the perfect brother.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.770
Well, thank you.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.950
Which is why you must be destroyed!

16:01.740 --> 16:02.740
Excuse me?

16:03.100 --> 16:03.810
Jackson!

16:05.320 --> 16:07.720
Who you think you are is not who you really are.

16:08.270 --> 16:09.870
This is what I made you.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.140
I turned you into the brother that I thought I wanted.

16:13.140 --> 16:13.760
The truth is...

16:13.900 --> 16:16.230
you're bratty and stinky and sloppy and lazy

16:16.230 --> 16:18.800
and stinky and horrible to live with and...

16:19.350 --> 16:22.850
And you're stinky! But I would take that over this!

16:23.300 --> 16:24.200
Oh, you!

16:24.850 --> 16:28.850
Talented and funny! As if I needed more reasons to adore you!

16:29.760 --> 16:30.960
You don't adore me!

16:31.190 --> 16:32.690
Yeah, it says I do in my diary.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.120
I wrote you diary!

16:35.570 --> 16:36.370
See, you look.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.800
What boy dots his "i"s with hearts?

16:39.870 --> 16:41.370
I thought I was just sensitive!

16:41.790 --> 16:43.390
No.  Look.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.800
This is my handwriting and I'll prove it to you.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.980
I love Miley.

16:50.340 --> 16:50.940
See?

16:51.800 --> 16:54.000
You're right. It's identical.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.740
We both dot our "i"s with hearts!

17:00.000 --> 17:06.074

17:07.829 --> 17:10.839
Until we met, my life was an empty pit of despair.

17:12.349 --> 17:13.750
I love you, Angus!

17:14.150 --> 17:16.849
Right back at you, my Didgeridoo.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.560
Yeah, yeah. Touching! Get a load of this.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.140
You're on tuts!

17:24.619 --> 17:31.420
Eh, My Rico is the eh, magical monkey love of my hearts...

17:31.440 --> 17:33.040
A jungle monkey.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.600
This is why you're flunkin math. You don't study!

17:37.440 --> 17:41.240
You call that romantic? I'll show you romantic!

17:51.510 --> 17:54.010
Cinco Seis! Siete Ocho!

18:00.440 --> 18:03.140
You call that dancing? I'll show you dancing!

18:17.950 --> 18:18.940
Just follow my lead!

18:18.950 --> 18:19.950
Follow your whaaa...?

19:27.950 --> 19:29.250
How do you not remember this?

19:29.440 --> 19:31.740
You made the beard out of your own armpit hair.

19:32.550 --> 19:34.350
Smell it, that is all you!

19:34.950 --> 19:36.850
What kind of a twisted jerk would do that?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.900
The same jerk that made this.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.820
The Hannah Montana dart board, we've got the...

19:44.680 --> 19:46.480
Hannah Mon-toilet seat.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.270
And...

19:48.900 --> 19:51.200
The Hannah Mon-slamma bop bag.

19:52.780 --> 19:53.480
Try it! It's fun!

19:53.870 --> 19:55.170
No, I couldn't, I couldn't, no!

19:55.360 --> 19:55.960
Come on!

19:56.010 --> 19:57.410
I could never do that!

20:03.150 --> 20:06.050
G'day mates! S'cuse me for dropping in.

20:06.340 --> 20:07.640
Which way to Rico's?

20:09.030 --> 20:10.230
Good on you, mates!

20:11.880 --> 20:13.880
Come on, Jackson, you gotta remember this one.

20:14.110 --> 20:16.200
I finally got Bobby Lenworthy

20:16.210 --> 20:18.440
to come over and watch a movie with me and look!

20:22.030 --> 20:24.030
I would never do something that immature.

20:24.330 --> 20:25.630
Farts aren't funny!

20:28.270 --> 20:29.770
Farts aren't funny?

20:31.250 --> 20:35.250
Oh no, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.

20:35.650 --> 20:37.650
Mile, what's wrong?

20:38.370 --> 20:39.370
He's gone, daddy.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.030
Our little boy is gone

20:43.760 --> 20:44.660
You miss him, huh?

20:44.820 --> 20:46.520
More than I ever thought I would.

20:46.910 --> 20:50.310
I want my rotten stinkin, pancake stealing brother back.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.120
Well, it sure took you long enough.

20:56.330 --> 20:59.630
Right in the nose, just above the Hannah-stache.

21:00.010 --> 21:05.010
Jackson? Jackson! Jackson?!

21:06.040 --> 21:07.840
Amaze you?

21:07.850 --> 21:10.720
What do you think this is? An episode of Gilligan's Island?

21:11.410 --> 21:12.810
So this is all a joke?

21:13.430 --> 21:15.030
Daddy, I think you know what you gotta do.

21:15.690 --> 21:16.730
Yes, I do!

21:16.880 --> 21:17.680
Way to go, son!

21:18.880 --> 21:19.880
Wait, wait, wait!

21:20.090 --> 21:22.190
You were part of this? Why?

21:23.270 --> 21:24.960
To hear you say what you just now said

21:25.160 --> 21:26.760
"I want my brother back!"

21:28.010 --> 21:29.740
I know he drives you crazy sometimes

21:29.840 --> 21:31.290
But I think you know now that

21:31.300 --> 21:33.180
the brother you have is the brohter you want.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.400
And I did it 'cause he promised me a car.

21:36.290 --> 21:39.350
You are the most selfish, self-centered

21:39.360 --> 21:41.620
and miserable excuse for a brother in the world.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.640
Welcome back!

21:53.120 --> 21:54.020
I don't get it.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.940
You seem nice. Why do you like that Kangoo-runt?

21:57.390 --> 22:00.460
I don't. What I like is passing Spanish and

22:00.460 --> 22:02.620
the Didgerie-dork promised to tutor me.

22:02.890 --> 22:03.490
Duck!

22:05.490 --> 22:08.890
No way. My little Kun-fool promised to tutor me in math.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.340
Auh, heads up!

22:12.480 --> 22:13.080
You know

22:13.310 --> 22:14.710
I'm pretty good in math...

22:14.920 --> 22:16.620
And I'm A.P. in Spanish...

22:16.820 --> 22:18.720
Hey, we don't need them. We can tutor each other.

22:19.050 --> 22:22.650
You're on! We should propably tell them the deal is off.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.690
You know, I would.

22:24.690 --> 22:26.750
But it's not in my notecards!

22:27.970 --> 22:29.070
Mine, either.
