- It's not a request.

for our manifest destiny,

02:07.040 --> 02:08.553

02:08.720 --> 02:10.676
And do you want to know why?

02:12.360 --> 02:13.714
Because Miles Matheson

02:13.840 --> 02:16.593
and Sebastian Monroe

02:16.720 --> 02:20.793
are both outside of Willoughby,
which is supposed to be your town.

...doesn't fall squarely
on your shoulders.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.196

that's a load of crap.

- Sit down, Ed.
- I sit down,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.196

so the answer is, no, sir.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.158
I will not sit down

so you can shoot in me

Well, we've still got troops
all over the Northeast.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.831
We show up, it's going to be like
the Second Coming.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.992
Take care of the Patriots,
then Georgia is wide open.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.393
What?

18:30.640 --> 18:32.517
So this isn't just about
the Monroe Republic.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.432
This is about the Eastern Seaboard.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.030
It's all ours for the taking, Miles.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.679
It's better us than the Patriots.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.400
At least we can
restore some sanity.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.073
Sanity, right.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.351

18:50.920 --> 18:52.479
into the same nightmare
it was before?

18:53.280 --> 18:56.193
It's going to be different
this time, Miles.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.838
I learn from my mistakes.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.791
I can't do it alone. I know.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.117
My kid's going to help.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.989

I'll be back.

- It's a process, right?
- Yeah.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.791

a progress report.

Okay, um...

37:45.080 --> 37:47.435
Don't get me wrong, because...

37:48.440 --> 37:51.319
...it's not that I'm not happy
about all this

37:51.480 --> 37:52.914
because I am.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.238
What's going on with you?

37:58.520 --> 38:01.034
I was trying to tell you before.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.191
- This... see that?
- Yeah.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.271
I don't understand.
It's a guitar pick.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.760
That's not just any guitar pick.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.354
That's...

38:11.520 --> 38:15.514
That is a 1960s vintage
Fender celluloid.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.995
Pretty rare...

38:18.560 --> 38:20.471
...even before the blackout.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.993
But I had one just like it...

38:25.800 --> 38:29.395
...the night that...
you and I first met.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.632
A barbecue in Evanston,
remember?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.039
So I'm laying there in that basement,

38:38.200 --> 38:39.713
and I'm bleeding to death.

38:42.840 --> 38:46.117
I see that,
right in front of me.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.155
And I... I got it.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.079
What?

38:57.800 --> 39:00.474
You're a miserable person.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.153
Excuse me?

39:02.800 --> 39:04.313
We both are.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.479
You ended the world.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.070
I put a nail in its coffin.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.272
- Hell of a pair.
- Okay.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.679
But with--

39:21.160 --> 39:23.879
But with all the things
we've done, you...

39:24.920 --> 39:26.991
You should be cynical.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.194
Hopeless.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.917
But you're really trying.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.718
Trying to be better.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.431
Trying to build something
better for Charlie.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.635
And how could I check out

39:50.800 --> 39:53.474
without at least trying to do
the same?

39:54.280 --> 39:56.510
I need you to know...

39:57.720 --> 40:01.395
...that I didn't crawl out
of that hole on my own.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.233
You and Charlie pulled me out.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.953
Thank you.

40:37.480 --> 40:39.073
What are we doing here?

40:56.360 --> 40:58.158
We don't need Miles.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.756
We're going to get what's
rightfully yours without him.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.719
Torn...

41:15.920 --> 41:17.274
Take it easy.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.510
It's hard...

41:19.200 --> 41:22.670
...seeing your son in danger.

41:26.600 --> 41:27.635
You know...

41:28.560 --> 41:31.518
...you really have to
appreciate the irony of it.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.754
This whole time...

41:34.160 --> 41:37.391
...you were my ticket
to everything.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.835
And now that I finally got you...

41:41.600 --> 41:43.432
...my ticket's expired.

41:48.480 --> 41:51.120
You want to kill me, Tom?

41:53.320 --> 41:55.277
You kill me.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.560
But you're going to
let my son go.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.597
I don't want to kill you.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.193
You and me...

42:08.960 --> 42:10.553
...we've got work to do.

42:12.920 --> 42:13.876
