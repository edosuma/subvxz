00:02.085 --> 00:04.546
Previously on 90210...
ANNIE:
I-I found some articles

00:04.588 --> 00:06.340
about suicide
under your desk blotter.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.383
Are you really
thinking about suicide?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.218
I have Alzheimer's
disease, Annie.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.512
I want you to have this.

00:11.553 --> 00:12.888
ANNIE:
"My Dear Annie:

00:12.930 --> 00:15.140
I feel so fortunate
to have met you."

00:15.182 --> 00:17.977
(crying):
Marla...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.227
I wanted to schedule my
post-chemo checkup.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.521
Think I'm ready now.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.445
I really need your help.
What's going on?

00:28.487 --> 00:30.823
NAVID: It's Silver. She hasn't
been acting like herself
lately.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.406
I'm worried, man.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.576
I just don't understand why
this had to happen to her.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.495
Anyone would need a drink
and a friend to talk to

00:36.537 --> 00:38.455
after what you've
been through.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.721
(sniffs, groans)

01:07.943 --> 01:10.404
(sighs)

01:15.993 --> 01:17.995
NAVID:
Adrianna?

01:18.037 --> 01:19.538
Hey.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.622
(groans)

01:20.664 --> 01:22.624
I, um...
(coughs)

01:22.666 --> 01:24.585
Did you sleep here?

01:24.626 --> 01:28.255
I guess I fell asleep.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.259
How much did I
drink last night?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.469
You were pretty upset.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.805
Silver's in the hospital.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.097
Was that last night?

01:38.139 --> 01:40.475
Yeah... that was last night.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.978
God, I-I-I remember
dropping her off

01:43.020 --> 01:45.439
and then you
driving me home,

01:45.480 --> 01:47.315
and then I remember
drinking, but then...

01:47.357 --> 01:49.818
I don't even remember
going to sleep.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.946
I blacked out-- that's
never happened before.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.488
I don't even remember
going to bed last night.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.448
I don't remember a thing.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.329
You don't remember anything?

02:05.584 --> 02:07.669
You don't remember anything.

02:10.170 --> 02:11.339
What do you mean?

02:11.381 --> 02:14.259
I-I can't believe this.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.929
We kissed.
We kissed?

02:16.971 --> 02:18.263
I kissed you?

02:18.305 --> 02:21.141
Yes. You kissed me
and held me,

02:21.182 --> 02:24.478
and told me
you still loved me.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.813
What the hell
is wrong with me?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.774
Navid, don't be upset.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.109
Uh, how can I not
be upset, Ade?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.568
I-I cheated on Silver.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.030
Well, that's because you don't
really love Silver.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.365
That's what you said last night.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.618
What? I said that...

02:39.660 --> 02:42.663
Okay, um, you-you
have to go-- now.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.331
Will you call me later?
J-J-Just go, Ade!

02:44.372 --> 02:46.125
Please?

02:51.463 --> 02:53.548
(door closes)

02:53.590 --> 02:55.801
It doesn't feel real,
you know?

02:55.843 --> 02:59.554
Feels like I'm in a movie
or dream or something.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.350
Yeah. I've never been
to a funeral before.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.686
It's like she can't
really be gone, you know?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.604
I keep thinking
I'm going to turn around

03:07.646 --> 03:09.815
and see her alive.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.902
ANNIE: Marla would have
loved those flowers.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.738
Yes. Peonies were my
mother's favorite.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.740
Mother?

03:18.782 --> 03:21.368
I'm Brooke Templeton,
Marla's daughter.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.911
Oh. I'm Annie.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.999
This is my boyfriend Liam.
I'm sorry for
your loss.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.750
Thank you.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.085
How did you know my mother?

03:30.127 --> 03:33.088
I had been working for her
for the past few weeks.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.590
Just cleaning, organizing,

03:35.632 --> 03:37.092
running errands;
that kind of stuff.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.927
She was an amazing woman,

03:38.969 --> 03:43.348
and it was an honor...
to have known her.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.726
Even for as brief
a time as I did.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.770
She was quite a woman.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.857
Okay, everybody,
um, the service

03:51.899 --> 03:54.026
is about
to begin.
Nice to meet you both.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.110
You, too.
You, too.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.623
Dixon! Wait up!

04:11.501 --> 04:12.961
Hey, Harper.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.796
Navid told me what's
going on with Silver.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.048
I hear you're helping out
while she's in the hospital?

04:17.091 --> 04:18.759
Yep. Collecting her homework,
doing Blaze stuff.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.760
Whatever she needs.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.469
Then that makes you
the new co-chair

04:21.511 --> 04:24.056
of the prom committee.
Congratulations!

04:24.098 --> 04:25.224
Silver and I have been working
on it for months, but--

04:25.265 --> 04:26.641
Prom committee?

04:26.683 --> 04:27.809
I-I don't know, Harper.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.436
You do want to help
Silver, right?

04:29.477 --> 04:33.107
Right, but what do I know
about planning a prom?

04:33.148 --> 04:34.942
Don't worry. I've planned
three dances a year

04:34.983 --> 04:36.902
for the last four years;
I know what I'm doing.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.319
And it's basically
already done.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.821
Silver was in charge

04:39.863 --> 04:42.116
of party supplies
and general ambience.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.159
So... are you going to help
a friend in need,

04:44.201 --> 04:45.953
or are you going to
flake out?

04:45.994 --> 04:49.831
I'm ... going to help.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.916
(squeals happily)

04:50.958 --> 04:53.252
This is going to be
the best prom ever!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.878
Now, tuck in your shirt.
We have an image to project.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.260
Mmm...
Mmm.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.886
You think I can't keep
my hands off you now,

05:02.928 --> 05:06.181
wait until I get
you that tux.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.891
I'm actually excited
about it.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.643
I mean, it's funny.
Up till now,

05:09.684 --> 05:11.145
I've spent
every prom night

05:11.186 --> 05:13.354
playing World of Warcraft
with Allen and Gilbert.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.690
Oh, well, unlike
those prom nights,

05:15.732 --> 05:17.109
at the end of this one,
you'll be naked.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.401
Well, you'd be surprised,
World of Warcraft

05:18.443 --> 05:19.903
makes me do
some crazy things.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.863
Oh, really?
Mmm...

05:21.905 --> 05:23.031
(clears throat)

05:23.073 --> 05:24.116
Ms. Clark.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.700
Looking forward to reading
your final paper

05:25.742 --> 05:26.701
on the French Revolution,
tomorrow.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.203
Right, the French
Revolution.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.039
I'm all over it.
I hope so.
I'm sure I don't

05:31.081 --> 05:32.874
have to remind you how close
you are to failing my class.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.127
I was failing?
Since when?

05:35.169 --> 05:36.335
You got a D-minus
on your mid-term

05:36.377 --> 05:39.338
and turned your oral
presentation on Ancient Egypt

05:39.380 --> 05:41.133
into a lesson
on moisturizing.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.884
You need to do
really well on this paper,

05:42.926 --> 05:45.179
or I'll be seeing you
in summer school.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.556
Oh, my God, Max.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.391
What am I going to do?
I cannot write a ten-page paper

05:50.433 --> 05:52.227
in one night.
If I fail his class,

05:52.269 --> 05:53.394
I'm not going to graduate,
and if I don't graduate,

05:53.436 --> 05:55.438
I'm not going to go to C.U.!
Naomi, slow down.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.024
Look, when we were in Cabo,

05:57.065 --> 05:59.318
you learned the basics of
calculus in one afternoon.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.735
You can write this paper.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.321
(sighs) Think so?

06:02.361 --> 06:04.239
Of course I do.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.573
I mean, it may take
all night, but...

06:05.615 --> 06:08.618
we both know you do some of your
best work after midnight.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.121
That's true.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.137
You're here.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.225
Yeah.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.352
You're the best boyfriend.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.691
(knock on door)

06:39.733 --> 06:40.901
Hey!

06:40.942 --> 06:43.611
SILVER: Hey...
ADRIANNA:
Oh, you poor thing.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.281
I brought you some flowers.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.199
Aw...

06:48.158 --> 06:49.408
I'll put them in a vase.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.790
What are you doing here?
You have to leave.

06:55.832 --> 06:56.958
Not until we talk.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.126
Just go, Ade.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.795
Hey, how are we
feeling today?

07:00.837 --> 07:03.464
Mmm... okay.
A bit woozy.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.759
But I'm better.
Good.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.803
Can we talk in private
for a moment?
Yeah.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.222
That's okay; they can stay.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.806
They're like family.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.308
DOCTOR: Okay. Well,
the good news is

07:13.350 --> 07:15.227
you can go home today.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.644
The not-so-good
news is that

07:16.686 --> 07:18.479
I got the results back
from your blood test

07:18.521 --> 07:20.481
and there was no trace of
medication in your system.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.150
SILVER:
What does that mean?

07:22.192 --> 07:23.818
The medication stopped working?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.904
No, it means
you haven't been taking it.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.781
Yes, I have.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.157
Silver, as you
know, it's crucial

07:29.199 --> 07:30.742
for people with
bipolar disorder

07:30.784 --> 07:31.952
to be consistent
with their medication.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.453
And I have been.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.496
I've been taking
my pills every day.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.165
I can go home right now,
bring 'em back and show you.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.458
That won't be necessary.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.335
I want to show you.
Fine.
I have an appointment

07:40.377 --> 07:41.336
to see you day after tomorrow.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.004
You can bring them
with you then.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.256
Okay, I will.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.925
Now, be aware, you're going
to be a bit off-balance,

07:46.967 --> 07:49.010
and a little out of it
for a few days.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.595
You could even suffer
a little paranoia

07:50.637 --> 07:52.306
until the new medication
fully takes effect.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.391
So just take it easy,
get a lot of sleep

07:54.433 --> 07:57.144
and most importantly,
take your pills.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.104
I will. I have been.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.272
So I'll start putting
through the paperwork

08:00.314 --> 08:04.025
so we can get
you out of here.
Thank you.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.526
Well, that's good news.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.279
Great news.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.738
Yeah.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.282
That's great.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.908
(anxious laugh)

08:11.950 --> 08:13.118
DIXON:
Harper!

08:13.160 --> 08:15.036
Look, I said
I'm going to be there, okay?

08:15.078 --> 08:17.372
No! No, I said
I promise. I...

08:17.414 --> 08:18.748
I'm not going to say that.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.834
No! I'm not going to...

08:20.875 --> 08:24.296
Okay. I, uh...

08:24.338 --> 08:26.298
super-duper-swear promise.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.883
All right. Bye.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.303
So, you and Harper having fun?

08:31.345 --> 08:32.720
Oh, she's the best.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.056
Hey, Annie, Dixon... um,

08:35.097 --> 08:36.890
I need to talk to you
about something.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.143
What's up, Mama?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.394
(sighs)

08:39.436 --> 08:42.605
There's no easy way
to say this, but...

08:42.647 --> 08:45.400
your dad and I have been
trying to figure it out,

08:45.442 --> 08:48.111
and we have realized
that we cannot afford

08:48.153 --> 08:49.570
to send you to private schools.

08:49.612 --> 08:53.241
We can only afford
state schools right now.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.660
And we are so proud
of the both of you.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.955
I mean, Carnegie Mellon and-and
Pepperdine are amazing schools,

08:58.997 --> 09:00.790
and you both deserve to go.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.377
But you just can't
afford to send us.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.920
It's okay, Mom.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.047
We'll figure it out.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.923
I'm sorry I let you down.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.425
No, no, seriously, Mom.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.592
Don't worry
about it, okay?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.428
It'll be fine.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.320
This thing on?

09:30.362 --> 09:33.614
Mr. Kher, would you like to make
a comment for the record?

09:33.656 --> 09:37.369
Yeah. Waiting for
test results sucks.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.205
Look, it's going
to be okay. Okay?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.373
DOCTOR:
Hey, Raj.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.292
Hi, Dr. Harris.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.752
How's it going?

09:45.793 --> 09:47.546
Uh, this is
my girlfriend Ivy.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.047
Hey.
How are you?

09:49.089 --> 09:50.757
Yeah, I'm okay,
I guess.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.967
Well, Raj,

09:53.009 --> 09:55.803
I'm afraid
your CLL was resistant

09:55.845 --> 09:57.931
to that last round of chemo.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.682
And your platelet count
is also very low,

09:59.724 --> 10:01.601
which we would classify
as Stage IV.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.478
That means the
cancer's progressed.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.523
Okay.
Now that leaves us
with a few options.

10:06.565 --> 10:07.982
But while we're
exploring those,

10:08.024 --> 10:10.444
I'd like to get more aggressive
with another round of chemo.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.779
Try a single agent,
on a daily schedule.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.947
Every day?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.156
DR. HARRIS:
For a month.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.324
Then we'll see where we're at.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.328
DR. HARRIS:
I'm sorry, Raj.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.539
I know that's not what you
wanted to hear.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.606
Okay...

10:47.688 --> 10:49.816
Got everything we need
for an all-nighter:

10:49.857 --> 10:51.776
energy drinks, candy bars,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.070
and... bubble wrap.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.405
Bubble wrap?
Mm-hmm.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.656
It's amazing
how refreshing it is

10:56.697 --> 10:58.741
to pop bubble wrap around
3:00 in the morning.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.994
It's like smelling salts
for the ears.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.162
How's the paper coming?

11:02.203 --> 11:03.330
It's not. But check this out.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.331
Remember those
photos we took

11:04.372 --> 11:05.499
in the hotel room
in Cabo?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.667
Of course I do.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.002
So what are you up to?

11:09.043 --> 11:12.339
In this one,
I look fabulous, as usual,

11:12.380 --> 11:13.632
but you're blinking.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.342
I have sensitive eyes.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.303
And this one, you look good,
and I'm laughing at a text.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.179
Now watch.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.889
(typing)

11:21.931 --> 11:22.974
Voila!

11:23.016 --> 11:24.309
I'm totally geeking out
over this.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.810
You must be rubbing off on me.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.855
While that is very cool, you
really need to start writing.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.815
I know, I know.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.526
I'm such a procrastinator.
It's hopeless.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.361
How am I supposed
to write ten pages?

11:34.402 --> 11:36.029
Don't think of it
as a ten-page paper.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.281
Think of it as ten
one-page papers.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.574
Um, that sounds worse.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.036
Well, think of it as
half a 20-page paper.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.038
Or just an eighth
of an 80-page paper.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.541
Or alternatively, as 40
quarter-page papers...

11:47.582 --> 11:48.583
Will you shut up?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.126
If you start writing.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.461
Oh...
Okay.

11:51.503 --> 11:54.381
(sighs)

11:54.422 --> 11:56.383
All right.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.384
Here we go.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.971
HARPER:
Black lights? Lasers?

12:02.013 --> 12:03.722
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.226
We're supposed to be picking up
supplies for a high school prom.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.561
It's a formal.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.646
Yeah. Why would we need
all of this stuff?

12:09.688 --> 12:11.814
That's what I asked
the girl who ordered it--

12:11.856 --> 12:13.191
"Erin Silver."

12:13.233 --> 12:15.318
She was very clear
about what she wanted,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.153
and very... excited.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.822
Silver must have ordered this
stuff while she was manic.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.533
I feel a migraine coming on.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.826
Like the one I got before
Sophomore Winter Ball.

12:23.868 --> 12:27.581
Okay, uh, just
relax, Harper.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.916
Um, we'll make this work.
Everything'll be okay.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.086
Help me out.
You got it.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.921
(Dixon grunts)

12:45.139 --> 12:47.016
You can do it, champ.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.184
(sighs)

12:48.226 --> 12:50.478
Oh, mmm, that feels good.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.273
Can you come forward
just a little bit?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.567
Mm-hmm.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.526
Mmm. And down?

12:58.819 --> 13:00.405
Down just a little bit.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.075
Okay-- hey, hey, hey...
No.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.035
Don't you trick me
with your feminine wiles.

13:06.077 --> 13:09.497
Come on.
Back to work, champ.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.498
Boo/

13:10.540 --> 13:11.625
What are you on?

13:11.666 --> 13:14.669
Page four.
That's good.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.465
Yeah, just 12 half-page
papers to go.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.799
There you go.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.427
(sighs)

13:28.849 --> 13:30.644
(knocking on door)

13:30.685 --> 13:32.895
Knock, knock?

13:32.937 --> 13:35.356
Hey. In the bathroom.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.150
So, what do you think?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.235
I think you look like you again.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.654
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.114
Well, I'm starting
to feel like me again.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.407
So thank God for that.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.454
What's in the bag?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.997
I come bearing gifts.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.039
What? You didn't...

13:52.081 --> 13:53.249
You're so sweet.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.668
(laughs)
Come on, open it up.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.211
All right. Thank you.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.546
You're welcome.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.799
(gasps)

14:00.839 --> 14:02.967
Aw! (laughs)

14:03.009 --> 14:05.762
Legally Blonde
and red velvet cupcakes?

14:05.804 --> 14:07.888
It's embarrassing how
happy this makes me.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.223
Your secret's safe with me.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.353
That goes to show what
kind of film student I am.

14:13.394 --> 14:17.148
Oh, so you want to watch the
movie and eat some cupcakes?

14:17.190 --> 14:21.110
Um, you know,
I actually have to run.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.487
I just wanted
to drop that stuff off.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.156
Oh, okay.
But I'll call you
later and check in.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.282
Sounds good.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.368
Bye.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.119
Thanks again.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.788
(giggles)

14:49.806 --> 14:51.641
Well?

14:51.683 --> 14:52.851
It's great.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.519
You're not just saying that?

14:54.561 --> 14:55.770
No, I'm not.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.522
You make some good arguments

14:57.564 --> 14:59.148
and you back them up
with solid research.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.191
It's definitely an "A" paper.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.108
Then I did it!

15:01.150 --> 15:02.485
Yeah, you did it.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.613
Maybe I'm the one who should
be going to Cal Tech.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.240
(chuckles)

15:07.281 --> 15:08.241
Mmm...

15:09.450 --> 15:12.119
(sighs) My mind is saying
"Jump his bones,"

15:12.161 --> 15:13.830
but my body's
saying "crash."

15:13.872 --> 15:15.331
Make it up to you
after prom?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.666
Go crash.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.501
You earned it.
Okay.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.845
(knocking)
Hey.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.513
Hey. Oh, you can
help me out.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.181
I can't figure out
what dress to wear.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.850
All right, now this one is
fabulous, obviously,

15:33.892 --> 15:36.310
and it's really like
a prom dress,

15:36.352 --> 15:37.687
you know, in a good way.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.188
But it doesn't go
with the necklace.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.981
And this one is not quite
as fabulous,

15:41.023 --> 15:43.192
but it goes a lot better
with the necklace,

15:43.234 --> 15:45.027
and I really want
to wear the necklace.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.654
So what do you think?

15:46.696 --> 15:49.031
I'm a dude and
I'm your brother.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.700
I have no opinion.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.368
You're right.
Fair enough.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.162
Uh, can I talk to you about
something else, though?

15:55.204 --> 15:56.205
Sure.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.499
Cool.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.584
(sighs anxiously)

15:59.626 --> 16:01.753
Okay, um,
so, I've been thinking.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.922
If next year I go
to a community college,

16:03.963 --> 16:06.716
Mom and Dad could still afford
to send you to Carnegie Mellon.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.092
No, no, Dixon.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.386
Annie, look, it, it's cool,
all right?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.096
You've been talking about
Carnegie Mellon for years,

16:12.138 --> 16:13.890
and I know how much
it means to you.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.392
And I could be happy
at a community college.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.770
But you were so excited
when you got into Pepperdine.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.940
Yeah, I know, but who knows?

16:22.022 --> 16:23.566
Next year, maybe things
will be different

16:23.608 --> 16:24.859
and I can transfer.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.402
I don't know, Dixon.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.947
It really doesn't seem fair.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.449
Hey, it's okay.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.576
You sure about this?

16:33.618 --> 16:35.244
Yeah, I am.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.624
Thank you.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.418
You're not gonna start
crying now, are you?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.211
Oh, shut up.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.254
(laughs)

16:45.296 --> 16:46.255
See you at prom.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.056
Okay, so you should
probably drink plenty of fluid

16:56.098 --> 16:58.267
and, uh, keep
your electrolytes up.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.894
Ooh, you care about
my electrolytes.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.521
Of course I care
about your electrolytes.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.982
I love
your electrolytes.
Thank you.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.107
Okay, so the phone is
by your bed,

17:05.148 --> 17:06.901
if you need to call me
for any reason.

17:06.943 --> 17:07.944
Know where my phone is.

17:07.986 --> 17:08.944
Don't hesitate

17:08.987 --> 17:11.238
to call me for anything.
Serious.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.448
Would you go to prom already?

17:12.490 --> 17:14.617
(laughing)
Go, go.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.492
I'm going, I'm going.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.912
Maybe I shouldn't go.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.413
We talked about this, Navid.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.165
You're not gonna miss
your Senior Prom.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.334
It's not an option.
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.752
You can stare at a picture of me
on your phone.

17:25.795 --> 17:26.753
And dance with it

17:26.796 --> 17:28.464
Okay.
and kiss it.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.175
Oh, uh, I almost forgot--
your pills.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.387
Promise me you won't
forget to take these.
I won't.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.847
You want me to set
an alarm or something?

17:35.889 --> 17:36.973
'Cause I can do that.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.474
I don't need an alarm.
Thanks, Dad.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.225
(laughs)

17:41.644 --> 17:43.437
Hey, Navid.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.647
Yeah?

17:44.689 --> 17:46.983
Did you get rid
of my old bottle of pills?

17:47.025 --> 17:49.027
No. Aren't you supposed
to drop them off

17:49.068 --> 17:50.236
at Dr. Landale tomorrow?

17:50.277 --> 17:51.320
Yeah, but they're
not in here.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.656
Well, maybe you threw them away.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.617
Uh, no, I didn't.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.203
In fact, I just saw them
in here last night,

17:59.245 --> 18:00.830
when I was dyeing my hair.

18:00.872 --> 18:01.956
You sure?

18:01.998 --> 18:04.166
Positive.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.585
No one's been
in here since then,

18:05.626 --> 18:06.836
except for you, me
and Adrianna.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.004
Oh.

18:08.046 --> 18:11.257
There's no reason
Adrianna would have

18:11.298 --> 18:13.009
thrown out my pills, is there?

18:13.051 --> 18:14.677
No.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.347
Unless...

18:18.389 --> 18:20.975
Oh, my God.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.561
She never forgave me.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.063
What, what are you
talking about?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.356
Adrianna... I...

18:27.398 --> 18:29.316
she messed with my pills.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.860
How could she have done that?

18:32.570 --> 18:35.698
She must have switched them out
for a placebo or something.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.534
Of course! That's why there was
no trace of them in my system.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.078
Adrianna did this!

18:46.000 --> 18:47.418
Silver...

18:47.460 --> 18:50.337
I know that you and Ade
have had your problems,

18:50.379 --> 18:53.173
but there's no way that she
would do something like that.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.801
But she was
the last one in here.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.052
Look, the doctor said

18:56.094 --> 18:58.304
that you might still experience
episodes of paranoia

18:58.345 --> 18:59.722
until your medicine
totally kicks in.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.391
Hey, it's been a long
long couple of days.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.559
I really just think

19:03.601 --> 19:05.853
you need some more
time to relax, okay?

19:05.895 --> 19:07.772
Just get some more rest.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.650
Yeah, okay.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.570
It's weird, though.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.573
No...

19:17.615 --> 19:18.825
You're right, you're right,

19:18.866 --> 19:21.035
I'm just being paranoid.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.244
Let me tuck you in.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.623
