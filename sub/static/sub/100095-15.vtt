LIZ: Fine Caliber Arms
International

05:36.630 --> 05:38.598
is a 100-year-old
gun manufacturer

05:38.630 --> 05:39.938
run by Gordon Kemp,

05:39.970 --> 05:42.768
who inherited it
from his father
eight years ago

05:42.810 --> 05:45.335
and promptly started making
the FineCal 9.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.406
The gun of choice for
violent young criminals

05:47.440 --> 05:48.509
in Chicago and Atlanta.

05:48.540 --> 05:49.848
And dozens
of other cities.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.098
It's the cheapest 9mm
on the market.

05:52.150 --> 05:54.141
A gun with
no collectible value

05:54.180 --> 05:55.647
except that it's
a readily available,

05:55.680 --> 05:58.012
affordable weapon for
street-level criminals.

05:58.050 --> 05:59.881
So, what, Edward Martell,

05:59.920 --> 06:01.456
a 19-year-old
with a long rap sheet,

06:01.490 --> 06:03.253
murders a clerk
with a FineCal,

06:03.290 --> 06:05.429
and Reddington puts
the company that
legally manufactures them

06:05.460 --> 06:06.654
on the Blacklist?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.827
Reddington put Kemp
on the Blacklist

06:08.860 --> 06:11.124
because police have seized
more FineCals

06:11.170 --> 06:14.139
than every other
semiautomatic weapon
combined,

06:14.170 --> 06:17.003
and Kemp keeps flooding
urban markets with them.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.739
There's been
a local shooting.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.442
Victim had just been
accepted to college.

as well as the rising number

the FineCal this year.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.508

changed.

Reddington holds Kemp
responsible

for the death
of Sofia Salgado.

06:38.430 --> 06:41.888
For some reason,
seeing her die
really got to him.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.864
We're supposed to believe
Reddington's after Kemp

06:43.900 --> 06:45.458
because he's
emotionally affected?

06:45.500 --> 06:46.933
ARAM: Or because
Kemp sells guns?

06:46.970 --> 06:48.858
Mr. Reddington
sells them, too.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.299
Maybe he's targeting
a competitor.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.534
No, as far as
I know,

06:51.570 --> 06:54.300
Reddington only
sells weapons
for military use.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.069
Of course, that includes
armed insurrection,

06:56.110 --> 06:57.907
but military nonetheless.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.214
Okay, but he's asking us
to target a company

07:00.250 --> 07:01.945
that's not committing
any crimes.

07:01.980 --> 07:05.586
It's okay to flood
high-crime neighborhoods
with cheap guns?

It's a crime to knowingly
sell a gun to a criminal.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.401
Does Reddington have
a good-faith basis

07:23.440 --> 07:24.759
to believe that's what
Kemp is doing?

07:24.810 --> 07:26.573
Maybe. He gave me
a lead on the man

07:26.610 --> 07:29.579
who sold Edward Martell
the murder weapon.

07:29.610 --> 07:30.770
He says if we find him,

10:44.370 --> 10:46.565
She can't be
more than 23, 24.

10:46.610 --> 10:49.238
She's a classic
straw purchaser,

10:49.280 --> 10:50.975
and we can definitely
charge her.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.671
Her?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.517
I'm interested in
more than her, Harold.

10:54.550 --> 10:56.245
You need to take this
up the food chain.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.145
And how do you suggest
we do that?

10:58.190 --> 11:01.318
For starters, you can
make a case against
Judson Firearms

11:01.360 --> 11:04.158
for selling guns to a buyer
they should have known

11:04.190 --> 11:06.226
would put those guns
in criminal hands.

11:06.260 --> 11:08.353
You know how hard
a case like that
would be to prove.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.890
I disagree.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.524
A young woman
with an address
in the city

11:12.570 --> 11:15.892
who's suddenly decided
to collect guns...

11:15.940 --> 11:17.805
Thirty identical guns.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.070
Thirty of the cheapest guns
on the market,

11:20.110 --> 11:22.806
which just happen to be
the most popular

11:22.850 --> 11:25.444
among young,
violent criminals?

11:25.480 --> 11:26.777
She passed
the background check.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.242
How did she
pay for them?

11:28.280 --> 11:30.111
Cash.
Harold.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.284
Her age isn't enough.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.527
I'm not sure the volume
of the sale is, either.

11:38.830 --> 11:41.856
Now, if there were
a second sale...

11:42.830 --> 11:44.366
If Judson sold
to her again

11:44.400 --> 11:47.460
only a few months after
she bought 30 guns,

11:47.500 --> 11:50.469
there's no way they'd
think it's because
she's a collector.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.876
You want to send her back in,
this time, on the record.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.037
And tell her
to buy another 30.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.968
For her "collection."

11:57.010 --> 11:58.705

You were my friend.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.729

about this you can't
possibly understand.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.625
Oh, but I want
to understand.

12:15.330 --> 12:16.592
In fact, I insist.

You go to hell.
You need to stop.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.438
Reddington.
It's me!

13:27.470 --> 13:28.960
Whoever he is,
he's still out there.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.467
Answer me! Why!

13:30.510 --> 13:32.762
It's_ me!
Ilya, It's me!

13:45.050 --> 13:46.642
Dembe.

13:46.690 --> 13:47.987
I know what I saw,
Dembe.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.612
You're tired.
You should lie down.

13:50.190 --> 13:51.327
It's her, I know it.

Yes, he says he needs
to Speak with you.

**

14:21.620 --> 14:23.588
Are we concerned?
Of course.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.029
But I think the public
understands

14:25.060 --> 14:26.618
we can't be
held responsible

14:26.660 --> 14:30.118
when violent individuals
commit crimes
With our weapons.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.263
Com check...
Everyone read me?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.961
I'm here.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.035
PARK: Affirmative.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.196
Loud and clear.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.309
We hear you,
Agent Ressler.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.659
We could use a visual.

14:40.710 --> 14:41.972
PARK: Camera's up.

14:42.010 --> 14:43.602
Everyone seeing
what I'm seeing?

14:43.650 --> 14:46.141
It's Gordon Kemp himself,
sweet-talking the press.

14:46.180 --> 14:48.478
Let him.
One big fish at a time.

14:50.550 --> 14:51.710
I've got eyes on Carly.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.885
She's approaching now.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.028
Excuse me?

14:58.060 --> 15:00.358
Hey. I know you.
We've done business before.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.822
No problem
with the last sale,
I hope.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.088
No. No problems.

15:03.130 --> 15:05.064
The opposite, actually.

15:05.100 --> 15:08.490
I liked them so much,
uh, I was thinking
I'd buy more.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.405
Really?
Uh, how many more?

15:10.440 --> 15:12.658
Uh, I was thinking
another 30.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.272
I'm sorry,
remind me your name?

15:15.940 --> 15:17.646
Carly Ambers.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.069
Are you feeling okay, Carly?
You don't look so well.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.815
He knows something's wrong.
I'm fine.

15:21.850 --> 15:23.738
He has to know she's not
a bona fide collector.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.008
She's a wreck. He'd have to
be blind not to see it.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.654
The 30 you bought
last time,

15:27.690 --> 15:29.487
that was for _
a personal collection?

15:31.390 --> 15:33.221
All right. No worries.
We can do that.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.557
Look, I've got the cash,

15:34.600 --> 15:36.192
if that's what
you're worried about.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.424
No, no, I just need to get
a little more information.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.664
I can buy
from someone else.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.031
You're not the only one
that sells FineCals.

15:40.070 --> 15:41.389
There's no reason
to raise your VOIce.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.431
Kenny. Can I grab you
for a moment?

15:43.470 --> 15:44.869
Heads up, that's Kemp.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.730
Stay with them. Agent Keen,
adjust your position.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.134
KEMP: What's going on?

15:49.180 --> 15:50.670
JUDSON:
I got a few red flags.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.417
She bought 30 FineCals
a few months ago,
and she wants 30 more.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.111
Agent Keen,
we can't hear.
JUDSON: I don't like it.

15:55.150 --> 15:56.742
They're too far
from the mic.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.111
JUDSON: She's from the same
area where that mini mart
shooting just happened.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.050
If she's passing them on
to somebody else...

16:00.090 --> 16:01.910
Unbelievable.
Did you catch that?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.985
Did he just warn Kemp
that this might be
a straw purchase?

16:04.030 --> 16:07.056
I'm sorry.
It's so loud in here,
I didn't hear all that.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.852
Oh, he heard.
Damn right, he heard.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.561
KEMP: What?
I couldn't make that out.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.295
I didn't hear what
you said, but I don't
really see an issue.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.298
She's a collector.
It's your job to

16:14.340 --> 16:15.932
run a background check
and if she passes...

16:15.970 --> 16:18.109
I agree. Ijust...
Kenny.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.266
Make the sale.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.077
I say we take them both.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.646
You can't arrest them
unless they know

16:23.680 --> 16:25.238
they're selling to
a prohibited buyer.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.474
Kemp doesn't want to know.

16:26.510 --> 16:27.977
Agents Park?
Ressler?

16:28.020 --> 16:29.715
Sounds like Kemp's
the one driving this.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.308
RESSLER: You pick up
a gun manufacturer,

16:31.350 --> 16:33.181
you better be ready for
the heat that follows.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.414
To hell with the heat.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.519
I'm asking if you think
Kemp's guilty.

16:37.190 --> 16:38.327
Yeah.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.351
Then take him.
But do it quietly.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.028
**

16:45.670 --> 16:46.819
Gordon Kemp.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.497
Agents Keen
and Ressler, FBI.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.962
You're under arrest.
We need you to
come with us.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.501
I'm sorry?
Did you say FBI?

16:51.540 --> 16:53.633
Keep your voice down.
We'd like to do this quietly.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.931
No, I won't keep
my voice down.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.971
We need to do
this quietly, sir.
FBI! It's a raid!

16:57.010 --> 16:58.978
They're undercover posing
as part of the crowd.

16:59.010 --> 17:01.319
You got a search warrant?
If not, you got
no right to be here.

17:01.350 --> 17:03.784
Listen, you're gonna
be arrested for obstruction,
so back up.

17:03.820 --> 17:06.186
Friends, calm down.
There's no need for this.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.756
They don't have a case.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.917
Let's not let them
provoke us
into violence

17:09.960 --> 17:13.123
to justify attacking us
and taking our guns.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.390
We are not
the lawbreakers,
they are.

17:19.830 --> 17:23.630
We have you on video
advocating a sale
of 30 semiautomatics

17:23.670 --> 17:26.639
to a 24-year-old woman
you had to know
was a straw purchaser.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.171
I had to know?

17:28.210 --> 17:30.371
You guys are agents, right?
Not lavwers.

17:30.410 --> 17:33.868
It has to bother you
that a young woman
like Sofia Salgado

17:33.920 --> 17:35.774
was murdered using
one of your guns.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.515
I feel terrible about
Ms. Salgado

17:37.550 --> 17:39.211
and every victim
of gun violence

17:39.250 --> 17:41.855
killed by my weapons
or any weapons.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.148
I make guns.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.852
I don't get to choose
how people use them.

17:46.890 --> 17:48.494
Nobody goes after
the carmakers

17:48.530 --> 17:51.658
when a driver intentionally
runs someone down.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.839
Is that your vision for
the world, Mr. Kemp?

17:53.870 --> 17:57.829
That we only
care about people,
about human life,

17:57.870 --> 18:00.805
when the law explicitly
tells us we have to?

18:00.840 --> 18:02.728
Oh, sorry, I thought
I was with the FBI,

18:02.780 --> 18:04.805
not The Brady Campaign.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.340
RESSLER: Look,
I'm a member
of the NRA,

18:06.380 --> 18:07.745
and I believe in
the Second Amendment,

18:07.780 --> 18:09.338
but what you do,

18:09.380 --> 18:11.689
pouring more and more weapons
into high-crime areas,

18:11.720 --> 18:14.518
that has nothing
to do with keeping
a well-regulated militia

18:14.560 --> 18:16.255
and everything to do
with making a buck.

18:16.290 --> 18:17.359
And I make more of it

18:17.390 --> 18:19.187
every time
a shooting goes viral.

18:19.230 --> 18:23.599
Not only am I not stopping,
I'm ramping up production.

18:23.630 --> 18:26.519
In fact, I just
ordered shipment
of 6,000 FineCals

18:26.570 --> 18:30.404
from my factory in Atlanta
to my distribution center
in Chicago.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.037
We're done here.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.107
Mr. Kemp's attorney
just secured a hearing
on his arrest.

18:40.650 --> 18:41.912
Is this a great country,
or what?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.888
You watch the cars.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.718
All day, Raymond,
that's what he does.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.784
He watches the cars.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.786
I know what I saw,
Raymond.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.593
She's watching.

18:54.630 --> 18:56.291
LINDA: Nobody's
watching, Frank.

18:56.330 --> 18:57.820
This isn't happening.

18:58.330 --> 18:59.422
Tell him.

18:59.470 --> 19:01.938
There was no car
when I came.

19:01.970 --> 19:04.336
LINDA: Ever since that woman
broke into our apartment

19:04.370 --> 19:08.272
and dragged him off
and tried to access
hIS memories...

19:08.310 --> 19:10.403
I mean, whatever
they did to his...

19:10.450 --> 19:11.474
Linda, stop.

19:11.510 --> 19:12.841
It's okay.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.814
Things in our life
were normal and quiet

19:17.850 --> 19:19.943
and ordinary
before you came back.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.649
And I know
the two of you
share a past

19:22.690 --> 19:24.521
I_can't_ even
begin to Imagine,

19:25.530 --> 19:27.327
but Frank and I
had a life, too.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.362
Together.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.992
Our life was good.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.366
It's his life with you
that's troubled.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.265
It isn't fair
to blame Raymond.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.709
Listen to your wife.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.075
You're sick, Frank.

19:41.110 --> 19:45.274
Something is wrong,
and we need to get you help.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.538
She's right.

19:48.350 --> 19:49.544
You need help.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.514
There are people
I know who...

19:51.550 --> 19:52.539
Raymond.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.157
You don't understand.

19:55.190 --> 19:58.284
We need to do this
on our own.

20:00.190 --> 20:03.057
**

20:17.380 --> 20:19.371
I'm sorry I ever
dragged you into this.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.087
I'm so sorry.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.951
You did the right thing,
Raymond.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.321
Too little, too late,
I'm afraid.

20:38.370 --> 20:41.066
I never should have
Involved hIm,
let alone her.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.795
A whole...

20:45.540 --> 20:47.371
I'll be damned.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.037
Good for you, Ilya.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.071
There's_someone in
the driver's seat.

20:51.110 --> 20:52.600
I wonder what the hell
this means.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.515
Thank you for joining us,
Director Cooper.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.415
Before making record
in open court,

21:01.460 --> 21:03.883
I thought it best to have
a private conference.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.124
Your Honor...
Not you.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.925
I'm here to hear
what he has to say.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.919
this arrest would
be controverSIal,

21:10.970 --> 21:12.221
and yet,
you did it anyway.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.567
Reluctantly.
Mm-hmm.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.033
Because I believe
Mr. Kemp knew

21:15.070 --> 21:16.958
Ms. Ambers wasn't the actual
buyer of those guns.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.501
He was conspiring
to sell them

21:18.540 --> 21:19.962
to someone prohibited
from buying them.

21:20.010 --> 21:21.773
My client had no way
to know that.

21:21.810 --> 21:24.040
You've seen the video.
Carly Ambers is 24,

21:24.080 --> 21:27.072
a pawn being used by her
boyfriend, a two-time felon.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.338
She was visibly nervous...

21:28.380 --> 21:29.938
Is that
the legal standard now?

21:29.980 --> 21:33.040
Is my client supposed
to assume customers
who seem nervous

21:33.090 --> 21:34.910
are buying their weapons
on behalf of criminals?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.450
She was paying in cash,

21:36.490 --> 21:38.253
a classic indication of
an illegitimate purchase.

21:38.290 --> 21:41.453
Your Honor, my client
is a manufacturer,
not a mind reader.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.094
Bottom line, Carly Ambers
can pass a background check.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.564
He's not obligated
to investigate who
her boyfriend is

21:46.600 --> 21:48.090
or anything else
about her.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.835
His arrest is
all over the press.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.462
This is outrageous.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.536
What's outrageous
is Mr. Kemp's
disregard for reality.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.536
Your Honor, you know
what happened here.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.468
Carly Ambers
didn't wake up one morning

21:58.510 --> 22:01.479
and suddenly decide to collect
60idenﬂcalguns

22:01.520 --> 22:02.771
over the span
of four months.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.549
That is unreasonable
to believe.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.148
She doesn't own
any other guns.

22:06.190 --> 22:07.748
She doesn't know
anything about guns.

22:07.790 --> 22:10.486
Objection. She's not required
to own other guns,

22:10.530 --> 22:13.624
and Mr. Kemp is not obligated
to test her knowledge.

22:13.660 --> 22:15.252
The dealer knew
there were red flags.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.256
He warned Mr. Kemp
that she might be
a straw purchaser.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.767
It is not apparent
what was said.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.097
The audio is poor.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.769
And my client clearly didn't
hear that warning.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.028
That's for the jury
to decide.

22:24.070 --> 22:25.935
Well, I'm not even sure
you get to a jury

22:25.970 --> 22:27.506
with the facts
before me now.

22:28.910 --> 22:29.979
Oh, okay.

22:30.010 --> 22:31.170
I _see what's
gOIng on here.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.178
You called us into chambers
because Your Honor

22:33.210 --> 22:35.610
didn't want the public to see
you toss a valid arrest.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.140
Watch it, Director.
Watch what?

22:37.180 --> 22:38.613
We're Off the record.
What are you afraid of,

22:38.650 --> 22:40.186
incurring the wrath
of the gun lobby?

22:40.220 --> 22:42.688
Mm-hmm.
I've heard enough.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.982
All right, get out.
All of you.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.622
I will review
the eVIdence

22:45.660 --> 22:47.628
and let the parties know
when I have my ruling.

22:52.900 --> 22:54.629
JUDGE BORNS:
We are on the record.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.035
So, let me be clear...

22:56.070 --> 22:58.038
It is not for this court
to tell the FBI

22:58.070 --> 22:59.833
how to do its job
or who to arrest.

22:59.870 --> 23:03.306
But I do note, however,
that the US. Attorney's
Manual,

23:03.340 --> 23:06.138
FBI Handbook,
and Justice
Department policy

23:06.180 --> 23:08.273
says that no prosecutor
will bring a case

23:08.320 --> 23:09.810
that he does not have
a reasonable belief

23:09.850 --> 23:11.340
that he can win. _
We believe we can Win.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.517
Yes, but you face
an extremely high burden.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.882
You need to prove
that Mr. Kemp knew,

23:16.920 --> 23:18.922
or he should have known,

23:18.960 --> 23:20.496
that he was actually
selling those guns

23:20.530 --> 23:22.452
to a prohibited buyer.
Hmm?

23:22.500 --> 23:24.161
And don't get me wrong,
straw purchases,

23:24.200 --> 23:25.895
serious problem
in this country.

23:25.930 --> 23:27.295
There may be
more than 30,000

23:27.330 --> 23:28.934
attempted
straw purchases
every year,

23:28.970 --> 23:30.392
but the seriousness
of the problem

23:30.440 --> 23:32.101
does not change
the requirements

23:32.140 --> 23:34.836
for what the government
needs to make its case.

23:34.880 --> 23:39.749
Well, Ms. Ambers' age and
the volume of the purchases,

23:39.780 --> 23:42.578
they're facts that
certainly give me pause,

23:42.620 --> 23:43.939
but are they enough
to conclude

23:43.990 --> 23:45.719
that Mr. Kemp
and his associates

23:45.750 --> 23:47.388
committed a federal
criminal Offense?

23:48.220 --> 23:49.357
I think not.

23:49.390 --> 23:52.882
I find the evidence
insufficient to sustain
the charges.

23:52.930 --> 23:56.525
Therefore, in the interest of
justice and judicial economy,

23:56.560 --> 23:58.289
this_ case is dismissed
Without prejudice.

23:58.330 --> 23:59.490
May I address the court?

23:59.530 --> 24:02.431
No, you may not.
You have my ruling.

24:02.470 --> 24:05.598
The matter is sealed,
and the defendant
will be released.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.208
We are adjourned.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.606
LAWYER: Hey, I respect
you for trying.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.106
It's not just about
passing new laws.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.277
We should be doing more to
enforce the laws we have.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.719
Murderer!

24:15.750 --> 24:17.741
Selling the gun
that killed her
wasn't enough?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.883
Now you have to lie about
her being a gang member?

24:19.920 --> 24:22.718
We don't make
the facts, Mrs...

24:22.760 --> 24:25.183
(PANTING)

24:26.360 --> 24:27.588
That's assault.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.450
Aren't you gonna
arrest her?

24:29.500 --> 24:31.525
Get your client
out of here

24:31.570 --> 24:33.868
before _someone does
something even worse.

24:33.900 --> 24:36.596
**

24:48.780 --> 24:49.940
Drive.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.447
(ENGINE STARTS)

24:53.490 --> 24:56.254
You heard Judge Borns
dismissed the case
against Kemp?

24:56.290 --> 24:58.429
Yes. Elizabeth brought me
up to speed.

24:58.460 --> 25:00.621
Then I assume
she also mentioned
Kemp's next shipment?

25:00.660 --> 25:01.797
She did.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.969
I know Agent Keen
is frustrated.
We all are.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.025
But the law says
Kemp can ship those guns.

25:06.070 --> 25:07.492
How did Dickens put it?

25:07.540 --> 25:09.838
If the law says that,
then the law is an ass.

25:11.310 --> 25:15.132
I want your word that
you won't interfere
with that transport.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.172
Frankly, Harold, the thought
hadn't even occurred to me.

25:18.210 --> 25:19.677
But now that
you mention it,

25:19.710 --> 25:22.941
that sounds like
a rather splendid idea.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.016
Listen to me. I know
we've looked the other way

25:25.050 --> 25:28.918
or even helped blur the lines
from time to time
in the interest of justice,

25:28.960 --> 25:30.382
but going after
a legal shipment

25:30.420 --> 25:32.320
because you personally believe
it deserves to be stopped

25:32.360 --> 25:34.590
is over the line,
and I won't allow it.

25:34.630 --> 25:35.858
Well, how are you
going to do that?

25:35.900 --> 25:37.788
By sending me to my room
without supper?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.097
By stopping you.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.534
Touche.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.503
REDDINGTON: Heddie,
I need you to reach out

25:47.540 --> 25:50.509
to Chuck and Morgan
and some of the boys.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.041
I believe
we have a job to do.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.239
KEMP: You can't be serious.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.044
You expect me
to trust you?

25:57.080 --> 26:00.140
We understand
your reservations,
but the fact is,

26:00.190 --> 26:01.987
the last time we met,
we were just doing our jobs.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.351
And that's what
we're d0ing now,

26:03.390 --> 26:05.881
informing you of a threat made
to your next gun shipment.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.522
KEMP: What kind of a threat?

26:07.560 --> 26:09.152
RESSLER: The FBI
has credible intelligence

26:09.200 --> 26:12.795
that your next transport
from Atlanta to Chicago
will be hit in transit.

26:12.830 --> 26:13.865
KEMP: What kind
of intelligence?

26:13.900 --> 26:15.390
We're not
at liberty to say.

26:16.270 --> 26:17.862
You're not
at liberty to...

26:19.540 --> 26:20.837
Oh, I see
what's going on.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.599
You think you can scare me
so I'll give you
details of my Shipment.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.174
If you can't stop me,

26:25.210 --> 26:27.178
this way, you can track
where the guns are going.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.542
COOPER: Mr. Kemp,
we're here as federal agents

26:29.580 --> 26:31.719
because your shipment
is in jeopardy.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.719
Personal feelings aside,
we're here to assist you.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.557
Pass. I have
my own security.

26:36.590 --> 26:38.182
Of course, if you refuse,
we can get a court order

26:38.230 --> 26:40.221
and stop transit
altogether.
On what grounds?

26:40.260 --> 26:42.626
Our intel makes transporting
the guns on a public highway

26:42.660 --> 26:43.763
inherently hazardous.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.290
Look, you can fight us,

26:45.330 --> 26:46.763
or you can
accept our assistance.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.861
What a waste
of tax dollars.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.775
So glad the Bureau
could be of service.

26:54.910 --> 26:58.505
* Each one quicker
than the last

26:59.910 --> 27:01.639
* That it leaves us stronger
in the end *

27:01.680 --> 27:03.739
What do you think?

27:03.790 --> 27:05.849
It's a bold plan.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.051
You're gonna need to
keep your distance.

27:08.090 --> 27:10.854
Agreed.
I'll hang out
on the jet.

27:10.890 --> 27:14.894
Edward's gonna make
a run to this restaurant
he loves,

27:14.930 --> 27:16.591
China Moonlight,

27:16.630 --> 27:19.497
for some of that
tea-smoked duck.

27:19.530 --> 27:20.622
You should
look at the menu.

27:20.670 --> 27:21.932
If everything
goes as planned,

27:21.970 --> 27:23.858
we'll be in and out
by dusk

27:23.910 --> 27:25.935
and have dinner
on the flight home.

27:30.340 --> 27:31.876
Are we ready?
Good to go.

27:31.910 --> 27:33.070
I've got three routes
mapped out

27:33.110 --> 27:34.873
and agents are on-site.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.444
Talk to me.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.482
LIZ: We're looking at
three identical trucks.

27:38.520 --> 27:39.782
Is this really necessary?

27:39.820 --> 27:41.617
Unless you want
your shipment
hijacked, it is.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.116
Can't you just protect
the one with the guns?

27:43.160 --> 27:44.787
COOPER:
We roll all three.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.799
Two haul empty containers,
only one carries the guns.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.957
Each truck will take
a different route to Chicago

27:50.000 --> 27:52.423
and be led by an FBI vehicle
with four armed agents.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.462
Fine. _Just let me know
which one is real,

27:55.500 --> 27:57.809
and I'll tell my people
to load it up.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.660
ARAM: I can track
each route via satellite.

27:59.710 --> 28:01.234
Just need to know
which one's real.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.475
Keen, I want you chaperoning
the real shipment.

28:03.510 --> 28:06.274
Agents Park and Ressler
will escort the decoys.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.948
Perhaps Reddington
will be more reticent

28:07.980 --> 28:09.845
about hijacking
the vehicle you're with.

28:11.050 --> 28:12.483
DEMBE: We have a problem.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.511
The Task Force is
escorting the shipment.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.651
Harold_couldn't
leave it alone.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.528
No matter.
We stay with the plan.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.199
There's more. They're rolling
three identical trucks.

28:23.230 --> 28:24.527
We're only prepared
to stop one.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.162
We'll have to guess
and get luclq.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.339
Luclq? There's no luck
in Three Card Monte.

28:28.370 --> 28:29.394
It's a sucker's game.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.032
And we're the ones
being hustled.

28:31.070 --> 28:33.709
I don't play sucker's games,
and I don't like to guess.

28:33.740 --> 28:34.968
I'll call you back.

Not a good time.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.963
I-I know about
Harold's decoys.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.059
I need to know
which truck has the goods.

you have the all-clear.

29:11.910 --> 29:14.014
Because while Harold
may be dedicated

29:14.050 --> 29:15.745
to getting this shipment
through,

29:15.780 --> 29:18.180

to stopping it.

just about to go Off
to college...

she must have been?

you talking to?

REDDINGTON: Theoretically,
one should assume

29:48.650 --> 29:50.538
Ressler would
drive the shipment.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.411
He's the most experienced
field agent,

29:52.450 --> 29:53.610
the Obvious choice,

29:53.650 --> 29:55.754

perhaps it won't be him.

she's new.

29:58.990 --> 30:01.129
I don't know.
My hunch is,

Harold put the shipment with
the badass in the bunch.

I think it may be you.

have the guns,
Elizabeth?

on that truck.

Yes, and I was just
explaining to him

30:23.320 --> 30:25.788

till after the count of 10.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.788
One, two...
Tell Reddington I'm sorry,

30:27.820 --> 30:29.617
but he's on the wrong side
of history this time...

30:29.660 --> 30:31.628
...three, four, five, six...
...and if he thinks
we're gonna break

30:31.660 --> 30:33.457
or even bend the_ law
because of his opinion

30:33.490 --> 30:35.594

he's dead-wrong.

You betrayed us.

You told Reddington
which truck to hit.
