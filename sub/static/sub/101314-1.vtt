WEBVTT

01:19.717 --> 01:21.086
Thank you.

01:37.970 --> 01:39.772
Mommy!

01:55.486 --> 01:57.056
Do you know who this is?

01:57.089 --> 01:59.657
Hi, Lily. I'm your mom.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.029
Welcome home.

02:04.063 --> 02:05.965
Mommy,
you have to see what I made.

02:05.998 --> 02:08.032
What? What did you make?

02:08.067 --> 02:09.935
Look, it's a two-way radio.

02:10.803 --> 02:13.939
- You did this all by yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:13.973 --> 02:18.143
It still needs work before I'll be
able to talk to you in Afghanistan.

02:18.177 --> 02:22.614
I never would have been able to do that
at your age. It's very impressive, Tommy.

02:22.647 --> 02:23.949
I'll put this in your room.

02:44.036 --> 02:46.038
Those scars say
a lot about you.

02:46.839 --> 02:48.374
What?

02:48.406 --> 02:51.977
That I went to war a doctor and came
back a soldier, like you said I would?

02:53.946 --> 02:55.513
No. Don't.

02:59.785 --> 03:03.588
You know, most of them are on your
front, not on the back.

03:05.690 --> 03:08.127
It tells me my wife
was always facing danger.

03:09.594 --> 03:10.896
She never ran away.

03:12.597 --> 03:14.033
Tells me you're a hero.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.468
Is that really how you feel
about me now?

03:18.703 --> 03:20.672
I'm a hero?

03:20.705 --> 03:22.942
For going to war after
giving birth to our baby girl.

03:25.543 --> 03:27.012
That fight we had...

03:29.714 --> 03:31.749
Whoa. You've never done
that before.

03:31.784 --> 03:33.052
Sorry.

03:35.586 --> 03:37.189
But I didn't say,
I don't like it.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.577
<i>Emily?</i>

04:02.781 --> 04:04.515
<i>Did you fight in the war?</i>

06:25.958 --> 06:27.658
Hey, Love. You okay?

06:29.194 --> 06:30.295
What's this?

06:32.164 --> 06:35.733
It's Tiki Totem.
Brought it back from Hawaii.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.769
The natives believe
that it brings good luck.

06:40.772 --> 06:42.207
Hello there.

06:46.845 --> 06:47.846
Hey.

06:48.947 --> 06:50.115
She has your eyes.

06:51.783 --> 06:54.153
I'll give you two
a minute, okay.

06:54.186 --> 06:56.889
Hey, bye-bye.

06:56.922 --> 06:58.357
Bye-bye.

07:00.058 --> 07:02.194
Hey, let's get you into bed.

07:13.738 --> 07:15.140
Tommy, what are you doing here?

07:15.174 --> 07:16.975
Just watching over Lily, Mom.

07:18.243 --> 07:19.845
Come, I'll tuck you into bed.

07:19.878 --> 07:22.147
You should read
Daddy's book about Hawaii.

07:22.181 --> 07:24.349
He never shares his work
with me until he's done.

07:24.383 --> 07:26.151
Then don't tell him about it.

07:26.185 --> 07:28.787
He keeps it in his study
behind his new book.

07:28.820 --> 07:31.156
- He's writing a new book?
- A book for children.

07:32.457 --> 07:34.159
Come, let's get you to bed.

07:48.473 --> 07:51.376
I'm sure we can still get you to
your piano class in time, Emma.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.511
I'm not playing piano anymore.

07:52.544 --> 07:55.746
- What? But you used to love...
- Oh, you know teenagers.

07:55.781 --> 07:56.982
Love the things
they used to hate,

07:57.015 --> 07:58.817
hate the things
they used to love.

07:58.850 --> 07:59.952
Including us.

07:59.985 --> 08:01.853
Uh, look,
we can just take the bus.

08:01.887 --> 08:04.856
- I'm sure, it's nothing.
- Well, I'm pretty sure, it is.

08:44.463 --> 08:46.398
So, that's where my wrench went.

08:48.367 --> 08:49.968
How about you help me out
with the car?

08:52.337 --> 08:55.173
- Still working on that radio?
- It's much better now.

08:55.207 --> 08:57.309
I talk to Daddy
when he's asleep.

09:03.015 --> 09:05.284
How is that even possible?

09:05.317 --> 09:08.987
Tommy, having an imagination is one thing.
Lying is quite another.

09:09.021 --> 09:13.058
Tesla said, one day we'll be able to
talk to people in other dimensions.

09:13.091 --> 09:14.860
How about you hand me
that wrench?

09:16.962 --> 09:18.997
Tom, could you grab
an extension too?

09:19.031 --> 09:20.132
Sure, be right back.

09:41.053 --> 09:44.189
Tom. Stop playing games.
You're wasting water!

10:46.952 --> 10:47.953
Bee!

10:53.592 --> 10:55.293
It's okay. It's okay.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.069
Where does Dad keep
your EpiPen?

11:18.417 --> 11:22.320
You okay?

11:22.354 --> 11:24.623
<i>Emergency services,
which service do you require?</i>

11:24.656 --> 11:28.260
Hi, hi, I have an emergency.
My son's allergic to bees and he's just...

11:28.293 --> 11:30.495
I'm fine, Mommy.
You don't have to take me.

11:30.529 --> 11:33.265
Just a second. Tommy,
you need to go to the hospital.

11:33.298 --> 11:35.634
Last time it happened,
Dad didn't take me.

11:36.001 --> 11:37.335
He didn't?

11:40.372 --> 11:43.708
- Uh, nev-never mind, so-sorry.
- <i>Okay.</i>

11:47.546 --> 11:49.281
You'll tell me
if you feel strange, right?

11:50.015 --> 11:51.082
Okay.

11:53.685 --> 11:55.086
Uh...

11:55.654 --> 11:57.556
Tommy.

11:57.589 --> 12:00.625
Did you notice any sound
of water in the garage just now?

12:04.463 --> 12:07.332
I want to show you Dad's work
before he comes back from town.

12:07.365 --> 12:08.801
Tommy,
that's called snooping.

12:08.835 --> 12:12.137
It's called having an interest in
what your parents do for a living!

12:34.426 --> 12:36.695
Do you know that demons
can enter people?

12:42.167 --> 12:45.203
This is a Mujina.
A woman without a face.

12:45.237 --> 12:46.806
Dad says her name is Akela.

12:46.839 --> 12:50.208
Tommy. I'm not sure how comfortable I
am with us messing up your dad's study.

12:50.242 --> 12:53.345
I'll do it quickly to relieve you of
your discomfort as soon as possible!

13:09.094 --> 13:10.595
These are the Night Marchers.

13:10.629 --> 13:13.231
One look into their eyes
can suck you in forever.

13:38.490 --> 13:39.724
Spells.

13:40.860 --> 13:43.295
See, a whole book
filled with chants.

13:44.696 --> 13:46.799
A kahuna did one on me
to protect me!

13:52.170 --> 13:54.139
Scary stuff, isn't it?

13:55.875 --> 13:58.343
And if you look at that,

13:58.376 --> 14:01.246
you can't really blame me for wanting to
write something for children, can you?

14:03.148 --> 14:04.716
Tommy, could I have a moment
with your dad please?

14:17.729 --> 14:20.498
Ethan, you're a professor at
Oxford commissioned to explore

14:20.532 --> 14:23.803
the early Polynesian history
of the Hawaiian culture, I mean,

14:23.836 --> 14:26.104
why the sudden interest
of writing children books?

14:27.505 --> 14:28.908
Look at all this.

14:28.941 --> 14:31.276
I mean, all these things!

14:31.309 --> 14:34.379
They're just
things to you and me.

14:34.412 --> 14:36.648
We call them
what the natives call them,

14:36.681 --> 14:40.820
at the end of the day, it's just
stuff we're interested in.

14:40.853 --> 14:44.155
And we study it
like we dissect insects.

14:44.689 --> 14:46.391
Look.

14:46.424 --> 14:48.526
This is Mali.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.329
I met her on my research trip
to Hawaii.

14:51.363 --> 14:57.903
I pretended to believe her when
she told me what she believed in.

14:57.937 --> 15:01.606
I sucked all her most
intimate stories out of her,

15:01.640 --> 15:05.410
for what,
to sell it to the world.

15:05.443 --> 15:09.581
Making people care about how she sees
the world. What's wrong with that?

15:09.614 --> 15:12.617
I'm making the whole world
want to visit Hawaii,

15:12.651 --> 15:17.188
and then turn whatever makes her special
into some cheap tourist attractions.

15:17.222 --> 15:18.824
That's what's wrong.

15:18.858 --> 15:20.558
I want to go back.

15:20.592 --> 15:22.327
I want to return
all the artefacts.

15:24.897 --> 15:28.633
Maybe it'll be good
for you too, good for us.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.635
We could turn it
into a family holiday.

15:32.537 --> 15:34.239
You've never exploited anyone.

15:37.910 --> 15:40.211
I only just got back.

15:40.245 --> 15:42.213
- I missed it.
- I know.

16:14.847 --> 16:16.214
Tommy, what are you doing?

16:17.783 --> 16:20.920
Doing the spell to protect me
against bad things happening.

16:20.953 --> 16:23.488
The one the kahuna taught me.

16:23.521 --> 16:25.825
Nothing bad's going to
happen to you.

16:25.858 --> 16:27.459
I'm here to protect you.

16:28.928 --> 16:30.763
I love you.

16:30.796 --> 16:32.297
Come on, let's go
get something to eat.

16:36.936 --> 16:39.704
<i>Did you know
that demons can enter people?</i>

17:04.797 --> 17:06.898
We need to talk about Tommy.

17:06.932 --> 17:08.768
- I'm worried about him.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:11.496 --> 18:13.398
Forgive me for being crude,

18:14.532 --> 18:15.700
but you're not crazy, you know.

18:16.701 --> 18:17.803
Excuse me?

18:20.105 --> 18:21.406
Here's my card.

18:23.142 --> 18:24.676
Don't let them know,
I've given that to you.

18:24.709 --> 18:29.347
It's bad for business, if patients
realize they're not "patients" after all.

18:32.084 --> 18:33.085
But...

18:36.889 --> 18:38.623
There is something...

18:39.859 --> 18:43.595
ominous that surrounds
your home.

18:45.865 --> 18:49.701
Ah. Give me a ring
when that makes sense to you.

19:04.482 --> 19:06.752
Mrs. Cormack,
the doctor will see you now.

20:50.722 --> 20:53.192
Izzy, what are you doing?

20:53.225 --> 20:56.195
I came back from the doctor
and found this.

20:56.228 --> 20:58.897
- I want to know, who did it and why...
- Tommy.

20:59.731 --> 21:01.266
It was Tommy.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.268
He did it,
just before you got back.

21:03.969 --> 21:05.771
What? Why?

21:05.804 --> 21:07.906
I don't know.
Maybe, he's just looking for attention.

21:08.941 --> 21:10.042
Tommy?

21:13.078 --> 21:14.947
Tommy, did you turn
these photographs around?

21:16.949 --> 21:18.516
I'm getting
to the bottom of this.

21:24.323 --> 21:25.656
All right, Tommy let's go.

24:09.788 --> 24:13.492
I remember the first time you told
me you wanted to play the piano.

24:13.525 --> 24:17.062
We went to this shopping center and there was
a pianist playing in the clothing department.

24:19.198 --> 24:21.333
You stopped and asked
if we could stay and listen.

24:22.801 --> 24:25.938
I sat with you for 20 minutes.

24:25.971 --> 24:28.840
When he finished playing,
you looked up at me and you said...

24:28.874 --> 24:30.375
"I'm going to
do that too, Mommy."

24:31.276 --> 24:33.245
It was the first time
you called me Mom.

24:34.513 --> 24:35.847
Do you remember?

24:42.988 --> 24:44.856
Emma!

24:44.890 --> 24:46.391
Emma, what have you done!

24:47.259 --> 24:48.427
Ethan!

24:50.095 --> 24:51.263
Ethan!

24:53.065 --> 24:55.300
- Izzy.
- Dial the ambulance.

24:55.334 --> 24:57.336
What, what's the matter?

24:57.936 --> 24:59.238
Wha-wha...

25:02.874 --> 25:04.443
Where's Emma?

25:05.844 --> 25:08.780
No. No.
Call the ambulance.

25:08.814 --> 25:10.748
Izzy, but what happened?
What's going on?

25:11.016 --> 25:12.117
Emma.

25:15.554 --> 25:17.055
Emma.

25:21.460 --> 25:22.995
Emma.

25:26.531 --> 25:27.799
Emma.

25:29.034 --> 25:30.902
Where's Emma?

25:30.936 --> 25:33.872
She's at her mom's,
I left you a note.

25:33.905 --> 25:36.475
No, you didn't.
She hates staying there.

25:36.508 --> 25:38.343
Okay, she didn't want me
to tell you.

25:39.011 --> 25:40.946
Where is Emma?

25:40.979 --> 25:43.582
- She's staying at a friend's house.
- No. No!

25:43.615 --> 25:45.984
- She's almost 18, we...
- No! It's not that!

25:46.018 --> 25:47.252
Look, I'll show you, come!

25:48.854 --> 25:51.023
It's all on camera, look.

26:07.973 --> 26:09.174
And?

26:11.209 --> 26:13.312
Emma was there,
I was talking to her.

26:14.046 --> 26:15.113
What's that?

26:18.317 --> 26:20.385
Well, that's just the light
from the window.

26:26.358 --> 26:27.993
The...

26:28.026 --> 26:30.195
The piano,
you heard the piano, right?

26:33.498 --> 26:36.401
- You're lying to me!
- Izzy, Izzy...

26:36.435 --> 26:39.338
Why don't you tell me
what happened to you in Marjah.

26:39.371 --> 26:41.039
It has nothing to do with that!

26:42.407 --> 26:45.210
- Are you taking your pills?
- Yes.

26:45.243 --> 26:47.346
- And it wasn't a hallucination.
- Listen to me.

26:47.379 --> 26:50.148
Why don't we take that family
holiday I've been talking about?

26:50.182 --> 26:52.217
I really think a short break
will do you good.

26:52.250 --> 26:55.120
I'm not stressed, Ethan.
The doctor said...

26:56.655 --> 26:57.956
Did you see that?

26:58.990 --> 26:59.991
There.

27:08.066 --> 27:10.268
It's just Tommy.

27:10.302 --> 27:11.970
And you look
pretty stressed to me.

27:32.391 --> 27:33.558
See.

27:36.495 --> 27:38.463
I'm not leaving
till I figure this out.

27:44.035 --> 27:45.170
Okay.

28:09.461 --> 28:11.229
<i>Hello, Elizabeth.</i>

28:11.263 --> 28:13.131
How did you know
it was me calling?

28:15.033 --> 28:16.535
<i>I sense it's an emergency.</i>

28:23.708 --> 28:24.877
You can set up in here.

28:24.911 --> 28:28.346
Uh, may I ask that we get
the formalities out of the way?

28:28.380 --> 28:29.849
Listen, my husband believes

28:29.882 --> 28:32.350
it's easier to indulge in the eternal
after completing material matters.

28:32.384 --> 28:33.485
Oh, of course.

28:34.686 --> 28:36.521
- Thank you.
- Um, hello?

28:36.555 --> 28:39.691
Ethan, I asked Richard to
come here to perform a seance.

28:39.724 --> 28:41.660
Uh. Good afternoon.
I'm Richard Turner, this is Hugh...

28:41.693 --> 28:43.562
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
Can I speak to you for a moment?

28:43.595 --> 28:46.164
Sure. I'll be right back.

28:50.602 --> 28:52.471
- Who are these people?
- Look...

28:54.172 --> 28:55.674
I met Richard
at the psychologist's office,

28:55.707 --> 28:59.177
and he just understood what was wrong
with me without me saying anything.

28:59.211 --> 29:01.379
And then,
and then I called him,

29:01.413 --> 29:03.148
and he knew we needed help.

29:03.181 --> 29:07.686
So, this stalker is hitting on women with
mental problems in a psychologist's office?

29:07.719 --> 29:10.622
It's so unlike you to be jealous
and Richard's gay.

29:12.825 --> 29:15.627
Look, I know this
doesn't make much sense to you

29:15.660 --> 29:17.429
and to be quite frank,
it doesn't make much sense to me...

29:17.462 --> 29:19.631
No, no, it makes perfect sense.

29:19.664 --> 29:20.833
Don't you see?

29:20.867 --> 29:24.369
He pays the receptionist
to get information on patients.

29:24.402 --> 29:27.439
He puts your number in his phone
and he knows when you're calling.

29:27.472 --> 29:30.609
Then he sells you some
whack-job spiritual mumbo jumbo.

29:30.642 --> 29:33.512
Look, I'm not asking you to understand,
but I just want you to respect...

29:33.545 --> 29:35.347
- I'm getting these people out of my house.
- No.

29:35.380 --> 29:37.249
I went to see
a psychologist for you.

29:37.282 --> 29:39.584
Now this is for me,
and you will respect that.

29:41.686 --> 29:43.255
I'm taking
the children to a hotel.

29:43.288 --> 29:45.156
Come on, Ethan,
you're overreacting.

29:45.190 --> 29:47.259
What, I'm overreacting?

29:47.292 --> 29:50.328
Ever since you've been back,
you've been a disaster.

29:50.362 --> 29:52.097
And I'm overreacting?

29:53.331 --> 29:55.400
Emma? Tommy!

30:00.272 --> 30:01.606
- I do apologize.
- Please.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.777
No need for apologies.
This can be very difficult for a family.

30:04.810 --> 30:06.578
Please, sit.

30:06.611 --> 30:11.349
I will try to communicate,
what I can to you.

30:11.383 --> 30:14.085
Please feel free to ask
any questions whilst I'm in it.

30:14.887 --> 30:16.187
In what?

30:17.757 --> 30:19.524
You'll see.

30:19.558 --> 30:22.227
Hugh will be recording
everything from here.

30:22.260 --> 30:24.797
This night-vision camera
can detect ectoplasm,

30:24.830 --> 30:28.133
the substance astral bodies
leave behind.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.135
And our white noise machine
catches frequencies

30:30.168 --> 30:31.436
humans have a hard time hearing.

30:36.308 --> 30:39.678
Sometimes we find something,
but it's not a sure thing.

30:40.745 --> 30:43.081
Just remember,
whatever happens...

30:44.249 --> 30:45.617
stay calm.

30:46.618 --> 30:48.720
Stay seated.

30:49.855 --> 30:53.158
Do not attempt to make
physical contact with a spirit.

30:53.859 --> 30:55.594
It is not safe.

31:23.321 --> 31:25.290
Someone is here.

31:29.561 --> 31:31.262
A... A woman.

31:36.936 --> 31:39.170
A woman who lived here.

31:39.204 --> 31:40.773
She is attached to this place.

31:42.674 --> 31:44.275
What does she want?

31:45.945 --> 31:48.446
Something's bothering her.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.649
Something's wrong.
She wants...

31:50.682 --> 31:51.884
What is it?

31:56.856 --> 31:57.857
Are you okay?

32:13.906 --> 32:16.241
The demon's inside!

33:03.588 --> 33:05.290
There is a presence here.

33:07.927 --> 33:09.327
What does it want?

33:09.962 --> 33:11.429
Something dark.

33:13.799 --> 33:15.500
Your family is in great danger.

33:18.838 --> 33:20.538
This house needs
a proper cleansing.

33:22.775 --> 33:24.542
Can you... Can you do it?

33:24.576 --> 33:25.744
He needs to rest.

33:27.746 --> 33:29.815
- Oh, thank you.
- We'll have to come back another day.

33:45.765 --> 33:48.433
- Ethan, Ethan, I have proof that I...
- <i>Yeah?</i>

33:49.969 --> 33:51.369
<i>What? Izzy?</i>

33:51.837 --> 33:52.938
<i>What?</i>

33:57.408 --> 33:58.309
What...

33:58.343 --> 33:59.879
<i>Come on, Izzy,
what is this?</i>

34:01.446 --> 34:03.581
- <i>Huh? You there?</i>
- Huh, yeah.

34:04.549 --> 34:05.785
I'm still here.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.387
Ethan, you were right.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.489
You were right
about everything, I-I...

34:14.492 --> 34:16.027
Please, come back
so we can talk.

34:17.062 --> 34:18.730
I'm such a fool.

34:40.618 --> 34:42.387
We didn't go past
the corner shop.

34:45.157 --> 34:47.492
There's no way I'm gonna
give up on you that easily.

34:48.626 --> 34:50.695
What should I do?

34:50.728 --> 34:53.598
Our bags are packed,
why don't you get yours?

34:55.034 --> 34:56.568
Then we'll go on that holiday.

35:55.493 --> 35:57.629
Emma, can you get the keys
from the postbox?

36:02.134 --> 36:04.636
You'll love it,
it was so great last time.

36:06.005 --> 36:07.605
All right, Tommy?

36:08.539 --> 36:09.808
Home, sweet home.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.549
You can't say it.

36:18.583 --> 36:20.585
- <i>Humu-naka...</i>
- Wrong.

36:20.618 --> 36:22.587
Then you say.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.489
<i>Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.</i>

36:24.522 --> 36:27.059
- You're making that up.
- No, it's a real fish.

36:27.092 --> 36:28.827
I'll show you one in the lagoon.

36:30.095 --> 36:31.529
Fine.

36:36.001 --> 36:38.804
Tommy, why don't you go
with your sister? Could be fun.

36:44.509 --> 36:46.145
I have to walk through the bees.

36:46.178 --> 36:48.680
The bees don't really
come out of the hive.

36:48.713 --> 36:50.149
You can always walk
through the house.

36:59.657 --> 37:01.459
See how high you can go.

37:02.962 --> 37:04.263
Whoa!

37:06.031 --> 37:07.766
Ahhh!

37:09.634 --> 37:10.869
Whoo!

38:53.138 --> 38:54.940
Mommy?

38:54.973 --> 38:56.341
Have you seen my dominoes?

38:57.976 --> 39:00.179
Tommy.

39:00.212 --> 39:02.147
Why did you turn over
those family photographs?

39:03.248 --> 39:04.817
You can tell me...

39:05.517 --> 39:08.787
- I didn't.
- Stop lying to me!

39:08.821 --> 39:10.823
You're keeping secrets from me.

39:10.856 --> 39:13.959
Tell me! What is going on?

39:13.992 --> 39:16.061
Who were you speaking to
at night over the radio?

39:16.762 --> 39:18.063
Huh?

39:18.097 --> 39:20.966
I caught you doing
a chant in your room!

39:20.999 --> 39:24.002
You told me you saw a kahuna and
she did a protection spell on you.

39:24.036 --> 39:25.270
What happened there?

39:26.972 --> 39:28.974
Tell me, it's important, Tommy!

39:29.975 --> 39:31.376
What are you hiding from me?

39:37.015 --> 39:39.151
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:40.819 --> 39:42.254
I'm sorry.

39:43.688 --> 39:45.824
We can talk later.

39:45.858 --> 39:47.893
When you feel better,
okay?

39:55.334 --> 39:57.870
- Hey. Where you going?
- Hey.

40:00.272 --> 40:03.108
Listen, I've been seeing things.

40:03.142 --> 40:05.144
Hallucinations.

40:05.177 --> 40:07.712
And it's not PTSD.
I've been taking the pills.

40:07.745 --> 40:10.816
How can you say it's not PTSD?

40:10.849 --> 40:12.885
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

40:12.918 --> 40:15.454
Tommy told me he saw a kahuna.
I didn't think anything of it at the time,

40:15.487 --> 40:19.224
but maybe she knows what's going on.
Maybe she caused it.

40:19.258 --> 40:22.060
Izzy, you've just came back
from war and you're a...

40:24.763 --> 40:26.064
Finish your sentence.

40:27.166 --> 40:28.800
You're my wife.

40:28.834 --> 40:31.436
So what, because I'm a woman,
it has to be PTSD?

40:31.470 --> 40:32.804
You called me your hero.

40:32.838 --> 40:36.408
And you are, but this has nothing
to do with you being a woman,

40:36.441 --> 40:39.845
and everything to do with
you being who you are.

40:39.878 --> 40:43.882
And don't you see, you run into
danger like it's not gonna hurt you.

40:43.916 --> 40:45.417
That's the thing about war.

40:45.450 --> 40:49.154
It always leaves scars,
and not all of them are physical.

40:49.188 --> 40:51.456
I'm going to find that kahuna.
This is not PTSD!

40:51.490 --> 40:54.860
Okay. Okay.
But she's not open now.

40:54.893 --> 40:57.329
We'll go first thing in the
morning and I'll go with you,

40:58.764 --> 41:01.133
Whatever it is
that's wrong with you,

41:01.166 --> 41:03.035
we'll figure it out as a family.

41:03.869 --> 41:04.870
Come on.

41:33.432 --> 41:35.234
Petey?

41:42.507 --> 41:44.910
Petey, outside, boy.

41:56.154 --> 41:59.024
Petey, outside!

41:59.057 --> 42:02.361
Hey, we left Petey at home
with the dog sitter, remember?

42:04.062 --> 42:05.497
Just go back to sleep, love.

42:26.918 --> 42:28.887
Tommy, what's going on?
Why you up?

42:29.521 --> 42:30.956
Mom?

42:35.127 --> 42:36.795
It's from the kahuna you saw.

42:38.463 --> 42:40.032
We'll go there tomorrow.

42:41.867 --> 42:43.302
Tommy?

43:00.952 --> 43:02.587
It's just
that silly Tiki Totem.

43:03.355 --> 43:04.823
It scares me too.

43:11.029 --> 43:13.298
Can I sleep with you tonight?

43:15.667 --> 43:17.069
Of course, you can.

43:43.695 --> 43:45.497
Oh, morning.

43:45.530 --> 43:48.567
It's my last chance to do some
magic before I return it all.

43:49.968 --> 43:51.169
Don't worry.

43:51.203 --> 43:53.939
Apparently it only works if you
burn specific herbs as well.

43:54.606 --> 43:56.508
- Show me.
- Yeah.

44:35.447 --> 44:37.249
- What's wrong with that boy?
- Mommy.

44:38.116 --> 44:39.151
I'll go see if he's okay.

44:51.329 --> 44:52.364
Tommy, where are we going?

45:07.145 --> 45:08.447
Tommy, where are you
taking me to?

45:22.227 --> 45:23.528
What are we looking at, Tommy?

45:25.798 --> 45:27.566
He says we should
get in the water.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.034
Who?

45:29.601 --> 45:32.370
He said I shouldn't say.

45:32.404 --> 45:35.273
He was saying "Why isn't Emma
afraid of the water anymore?"

45:37.042 --> 45:38.610
Okay, stay here, Tommy.

46:10.108 --> 46:11.376
There's something
pulling me, Tommy.

46:39.104 --> 46:43.408
Ethan, we found three dead bodies
in the lagoon. We need to leave now.

46:43.441 --> 46:45.310
I'll call the police from the car.
You go get Emma.

46:57.757 --> 46:59.057
Emma?

47:02.460 --> 47:04.764
Izzy, have you seen Emma?
I can't find her anywhere.

47:04.797 --> 47:06.164
- Have you looked outside?
- Yeah.

47:07.767 --> 47:10.268
- Emma?
- Emma.

47:10.302 --> 47:12.370
- Emma.
- Emma, darling, we're leaving now.

47:18.143 --> 47:19.779
- Is that a telephone?
- Yeah.

47:55.781 --> 47:58.683
It's the basement.
Stay here and call the police.

48:45.831 --> 48:47.967
- Hello?
- <i>Mommy?</i>

48:48.000 --> 48:50.301
Emma? Emma, where are you?
Are you okay?

48:50.335 --> 48:52.637
<i>Mommy. Please help me.</i>

48:52.671 --> 48:57.475
<i>There's a man. He wants you to follow
the sound of the boiling water.</i>

48:57.509 --> 49:00.946
Emma. Tell me.
What do you see around you?

49:00.980 --> 49:03.448
<i>Do you hear it? Please.</i>

49:06.418 --> 49:07.619
Yes.

49:09.621 --> 49:11.322
- I can hear it.
- <i>Follow it.</i>

49:28.573 --> 49:30.642
I found the boiling water.

49:30.675 --> 49:35.714
<i>The man says there is a table.
He wants you to tie yourself to the table.</i>

49:35.747 --> 49:39.350
Emma. Tell me what
do you see around you?

49:39.384 --> 49:43.254
<i>Please, Mommy. He's hurting me.
Tie yourself to the table.</i>

49:43.288 --> 49:45.290
Tell that man
that I want to speak to him.

49:45.323 --> 49:46.658
<i>He's hurting me.</i>

49:46.691 --> 49:50.662
Tell him I won't follow his
instructions until I speak to him.

49:51.931 --> 49:54.800
Emma? Emma, are you still there?

50:08.446 --> 50:11.851
What's wrong with you?
Get that mask off.

50:11.884 --> 50:13.318
I've seen it
in your dad's office.

50:16.055 --> 50:18.423
Just wanted to see
how much you really love me.

50:18.456 --> 50:21.794
- If you would put your own life in danger to save mine.
- Of course, I would.

50:21.827 --> 50:24.729
Yet, you didn't tie
yourself to the table.

50:24.764 --> 50:27.066
Emma, something terrible has
happened here and we need to go.

50:27.099 --> 50:28.801
Tie yourself to the table.

50:28.834 --> 50:30.635
Prove that you love me.
That you trust me.

50:32.004 --> 50:33.338
I'm not taking any of this.

50:34.639 --> 50:35.740
We're going now.

50:40.045 --> 50:42.848
Why are you still making breakfast?
Did you call the police?

50:44.850 --> 50:48.653
Uh, yeah. Of course. They're on their way.
But you found Emma.

50:54.425 --> 50:57.062
She was never in any real danger.
All right, we're leaving this place now.

50:57.096 --> 50:59.430
You tell your daughter to get her
stuff and I'm going to get Tommy.

51:17.950 --> 51:19.952
<i>Tommy? Tommy?</i>

51:19.985 --> 51:21.486
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>
- I can hear you.

51:22.620 --> 51:25.090
Tommy, we're going.

51:25.124 --> 51:28.459
- Daddy wants to talk to you.
- I just saw your daddy. He's downstairs.

51:28.493 --> 51:29.494
<i>Izzy?</i>

51:30.129 --> 51:31.462
<i>That's not me.</i>

51:35.733 --> 51:39.504
<i>You need to take Tommy
and leave immediately.</i>

51:39.537 --> 51:42.908
- What about Emma?
- That's not her either.

51:42.942 --> 51:46.779
- Last time we were here...
- <i>The family from the lagoon took our bodies.</i>

51:46.812 --> 51:50.015
- And they want yours too.
- That's not possible.

51:50.049 --> 51:52.417
<i>I tried to warn you.
The pictures on the wall.</i>

51:54.053 --> 51:57.056
<i>The piano,
and the baby monitor.</i>

51:59.792 --> 52:01.626
<i>We tried to scare you
away from this place.</i>

52:06.899 --> 52:08.801
Why didn't you tell me before?

52:08.834 --> 52:12.872
I tried. But they make it look
like I can't be trusted.

52:12.905 --> 52:14.940
I didn't turn over
the photographs.

52:14.974 --> 52:17.575
You stopped believing me, Mom.

52:17.609 --> 52:20.779
I told you. I talk to Daddy
when that man's asleep

52:20.813 --> 52:22.547
- and you...
- I'm sorry I didn't believe you, Tommy.

52:24.515 --> 52:25.583
We need to hide.

52:28.586 --> 52:29.621
Maybe in the tunnel.

52:50.708 --> 52:53.979
Please, leave Lily alone.

52:54.013 --> 52:56.048
You have no idea

52:56.081 --> 52:59.450
how I hated talking in your
husband's queer accent.

53:00.518 --> 53:01.552
Oh.

53:06.624 --> 53:07.760
Did you get the chant?

53:16.035 --> 53:18.736
It's our culture
your husband wanted to steal.

53:18.771 --> 53:21.840
So, she took him and Emma
for me and our daughter.

53:23.508 --> 53:25.811
Show army girl here
where to go.

53:25.844 --> 53:27.712
Your mom needs
a new body too.

53:36.521 --> 53:38.023
Let's try this again.

53:38.057 --> 53:39.490
Tie yourself to the table.

55:00.105 --> 55:01.206
She's here.

56:53.986 --> 56:55.020
Emma?

56:55.888 --> 56:56.922
Emma?

58:55.607 --> 58:57.509
Hello?

59:00.846 --> 59:02.147
Hello?

59:26.972 --> 59:28.140
Mommy, can you hear me?

59:29.241 --> 59:30.342
Mommy, follow my voice.

59:56.101 --> 59:57.102
Mommy.

59:59.571 --> 01:00:02.140
Tommy, please don't speak.

01:00:23.295 --> 01:00:25.130
Tommy, can you hear me?

01:00:26.298 --> 01:00:27.299
I can hear you.

01:00:27.966 --> 01:00:30.202
I need you to go to the kitchen.

01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:33.105
There's a door in the pantry
that leads to the basement.

01:00:33.138 --> 01:00:34.439
Take the tunnel
and meet me there.

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:40.312
Tommy,

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.914
I need your body to fix this.

01:00:42.948 --> 01:00:45.217
You're the only one
that can save us.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.285
We need to perform
transference on you.

01:00:50.222 --> 01:00:51.223
It's boiling.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.429
I need you
to pour it over your body

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.031
from your toes to your face.

01:01:02.434 --> 01:01:03.435
Can you do that for me?

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:08.240
Uh...

01:01:09.474 --> 01:01:10.475
Tommy,

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:13.478
your whole body.

01:01:13.512 --> 01:01:18.083
No matter what happens...
don't stop.

01:01:19.351 --> 01:01:20.352
Okay.

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:20.078
Tommy, you stay safe.
Mommy loves you.

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.450
Sorry, buddy. You know too much.

01:03:00.352 --> 01:03:01.353
You gotta go.

01:04:06.852 --> 01:04:08.119
Argh!

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:28.106
Is something burning?

01:04:30.675 --> 01:04:32.510
Tommy. The basement.

01:05:07.679 --> 01:05:08.613
What are you still doing here?

01:05:08.647 --> 01:05:10.248
Open the door, Tommy!

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:31.670
I'm letting you out now!

01:05:33.271 --> 01:05:34.706
I'll deal with Tommy.

01:05:58.864 --> 01:05:59.865
Go to sleep.

01:06:36.035 --> 01:06:37.335
Please let me out.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:49.982
Tommy, this isn't funny.

01:06:53.651 --> 01:06:55.855
Seriously, let me out.

01:06:55.888 --> 01:06:57.589
You've come from the house
in the forest

01:06:57.622 --> 01:06:58.858
where the road ends.

01:06:59.759 --> 01:07:00.760
Tommy!

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:06.564
A woman lived there.

01:07:08.934 --> 01:07:10.936
People whispered
she could transfer

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:12.637
the dead into the living.

01:07:16.341 --> 01:07:18.343
I sense she was murdered
with her family.

01:07:21.947 --> 01:07:25.583
But you've already been
transferred, haven't you?

01:07:27.519 --> 01:07:28.788
Tommy!

01:07:31.056 --> 01:07:33.691
It's my daughter. Emma.

01:07:33.725 --> 01:07:35.828
Tommy, let me out now!

01:07:41.366 --> 01:07:43.969
I'm sorry. I cannot help.

01:07:47.372 --> 01:07:48.808
You've lost someone, too.

01:07:51.043 --> 01:07:52.912
A spirit you cannot get back.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.714
I was in Marjah.

01:07:58.416 --> 01:08:02.687
A girl, my son's age,
was wearing an explosive vest.

01:08:05.423 --> 01:08:07.059
I shot her
before she could trigger it.

01:08:11.663 --> 01:08:14.666
I know what it's like to not be
able to protect the innocent.

01:08:16.568 --> 01:08:19.571
But how do you keep them safe
from something you can't see?

01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:25.911
You cannot.

01:08:29.581 --> 01:08:32.417
But we are going to try. Please.

01:08:36.788 --> 01:08:39.524
We must take her back to
where the transference occurred,

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:43.394
call her name. Call her back.

01:08:49.434 --> 01:08:50.435
Let's go.

01:09:30.575 --> 01:09:31.877
Mama?

01:09:32.676 --> 01:09:33.711
Is that you?

01:09:35.613 --> 01:09:36.613
They're escaping.

01:09:37.015 --> 01:09:38.017
Go.

01:10:22.895 --> 01:10:25.630
Tommy, it's your dad.

01:10:25.663 --> 01:10:26.664
It's not.

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:29.667
Aunty Mae,

01:10:29.701 --> 01:10:32.570
it's time to get my family
back into their bodies.

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:06.671
Did it work?

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:10.209
Tommy.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:13.912
Tommy, I'm so sorry
I put you through this.

01:11:14.579 --> 01:11:15.747
I'm so sorry.

01:11:27.192 --> 01:11:28.961
Go and see to her.

01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:30.195
I'll bring your husband back.

01:12:19.812 --> 01:12:21.612
Tommy, can you make sure
Lily's all right?

01:12:26.018 --> 01:12:27.019
Emma?

01:12:32.124 --> 01:12:33.292
Emma, are you all right?

01:12:38.663 --> 01:12:40.232
You've been lost for so long.

01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:43.902
Ever since the last time
you stayed here.

01:12:50.309 --> 01:12:52.010
<i>You must be so tired.</i>

01:12:55.047 --> 01:12:56.915
<i>It's almost over.</i>

01:12:56.949 --> 01:12:58.851
<i>We're getting your dad
into his body now.</i>

01:12:59.785 --> 01:13:00.786
<i>I promise.</i>

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.101
Izzy?

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.239
I missed you so much.

01:13:20.272 --> 01:13:21.273
Wait.

01:13:22.374 --> 01:13:23.876
The day I left for Marjah,

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:26.178
what did we fight about?

01:13:27.212 --> 01:13:28.380
You said you were leaving

01:13:28.413 --> 01:13:32.217
to stop the bleeding
of a country in pain.

01:13:32.251 --> 01:13:33.886
Even if it meant being apart.

01:13:33.919 --> 01:13:35.720
And you said...

01:13:35.754 --> 01:13:38.323
That their blood
will taint your hands.

01:13:38.357 --> 01:13:41.960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left.

01:13:41.994 --> 01:13:44.229
No. No, it was me.
I was just being selfish.

01:13:45.364 --> 01:13:47.966
The world needs doctors
like you.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.935
Doctors that become soldiers.

01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:51.436
Doesn't matter.

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:54.907
Just happy you came back
to save us, too, Captain.

01:14:00.245 --> 01:14:02.080
- Come.
- Daddy.

01:14:02.114 --> 01:14:04.715
You're back.
You're finally back.

01:14:08.954 --> 01:14:10.455
I need to perform a cleansing.

01:14:25.037 --> 01:14:26.505
What happened to her?

01:14:26.538 --> 01:14:27.839
Kaimoni.

01:14:27.873 --> 01:14:29.841
It is a dangerous demon.

01:14:29.875 --> 01:14:30.943
Where's Lily?

01:14:32.477 --> 01:14:33.845
- Look after Tommy.
- Sure.

01:14:49.328 --> 01:14:50.329
Emma.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.502
Please leave Lily alone.

01:15:33.605 --> 01:15:35.207
Sounds like she's in her room.

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:40.045
I'll make sure Lily stays safe.

01:15:42.547 --> 01:15:43.815
Listen.

01:15:47.886 --> 01:15:49.521
- Going to be okay?
- Yes.

01:16:01.867 --> 01:16:02.968
That's not Emma.

01:16:05.203 --> 01:16:07.506
Last time I saw
the Kaimoni take someone...

01:16:08.573 --> 01:16:09.841
it killed her.

01:16:10.976 --> 01:16:12.177
I killed her.

01:16:13.245 --> 01:16:14.246
No.

01:16:14.813 --> 01:16:16.214
You tried to save her.

01:16:20.319 --> 01:16:22.854
Her name was Ruby.

01:16:22.888 --> 01:16:25.490
I named her after the family
of the plumeria flower.

01:16:32.664 --> 01:16:35.033
Transference will not work
on a demon.

01:16:36.034 --> 01:16:38.103
A demon has never lived.

01:16:40.205 --> 01:16:42.174
I need to perform an exorcism.

01:16:56.054 --> 01:16:57.055
Emma?

01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:40.198
Please make it stop.

01:17:54.346 --> 01:17:56.581
Make it stop! Make it stop!

01:18:13.632 --> 01:18:15.434
The demon is too strong.

01:18:17.169 --> 01:18:20.038
The lagoon.
We must take her there.

01:18:21.006 --> 01:18:22.174
We need to kill it.

01:18:50.735 --> 01:18:52.103
Put her under.

01:20:27.699 --> 01:20:28.700
Emma!

01:20:29.769 --> 01:20:30.836
Izzy, stop!

01:20:33.238 --> 01:20:34.639
It will take her again.

01:20:44.316 --> 01:20:46.117
Take me instead.

01:20:46.151 --> 01:20:47.652
This girl, you will not hurt.

01:20:47.686 --> 01:20:49.789
- No, let me go.
- No.

01:20:49.822 --> 01:20:51.757
This is my fight. Not yours.

01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:54.659
You need to stay with your
family and keep them safe.

01:20:54.693 --> 01:20:56.161
That is your purpose.

01:22:17.843 --> 01:22:19.711
She's gone. It's too late.

01:22:19.744 --> 01:22:21.312
No. She can still come back.

01:22:28.821 --> 01:22:30.255
Izzy, Izzy...

01:22:37.495 --> 01:22:40.298
I can't remember.
What did she say?

01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:41.599
Just use your own words.

01:22:46.638 --> 01:22:48.974
I should've been here.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

01:22:53.378 --> 01:22:54.479
Please.

01:22:55.647 --> 01:22:57.382
Please, God, bring her back.

01:22:57.415 --> 01:23:00.385
Bring my little girl back.
Don't let another innocent die.

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.287
Please.

01:23:09.494 --> 01:23:10.763
- Mommy?
- Emma.

01:23:12.031 --> 01:23:13.231
Emma?

01:23:16.501 --> 01:23:18.403
Wait.

01:23:18.436 --> 01:23:20.472
What happened
on your 13th birthday?

01:23:20.505 --> 01:23:22.440
I tripped and had to get
a cast on my leg,

01:23:22.474 --> 01:23:26.011
but I didn't mind because
I could still play the piano.

01:23:26.045 --> 01:23:29.347
And, when I took you to your first
swimming class, what did you tell me?

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.483
That I'm allergic
to water.

01:23:36.721 --> 01:23:39.759
I missed you...
I missed you so, so much.

01:23:44.429 --> 01:23:45.865
And Auntie Mae?

01:24:17.495 --> 01:24:19.799
How about we open that restaurant
we always talked about?

01:24:19.832 --> 01:24:22.768
The one that only serves
home-brewed beers?

01:24:22.802 --> 01:24:24.302
With home-cooked meals.

01:24:36.514 --> 01:24:37.850
Mom?

01:24:37.883 --> 01:24:39.350
Does this mean you'll stay?

01:24:39.384 --> 01:24:40.518
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:49.962 --> 01:24:52.064
Then this is just lovely.

01:24:52.097 --> 01:24:54.767
Best pie I've ever had.
Just lovely.
