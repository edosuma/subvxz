00:00.109 --> 00:02.528
The Government of the
United States of America...

00:02.860 --> 00:07.074
has issued a pardon
for Lieutenant Templeton Peck.

00:07.157 --> 00:10.035
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
You're a free man.

00:10.119 --> 00:11.787
Yeah, we really
gonna miss you, Face.

00:11.870 --> 00:13.872
Why can't I be
the new scrounger?

00:13.914 --> 00:17.793
Don't try and be me, Murdock. I mean,
it'll just get you in trouble.

00:22.131 --> 00:23.674
I think we've lost Face.

00:23.799 --> 00:27.427
I have waited
for this moment for 15 years.

00:28.804 --> 00:30.764
Oh, boy.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.351
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.434 --> 00:36.145
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.688
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.813 --> 00:39.022
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:39.148 --> 00:40.607
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.774 --> 00:42.317
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:43.944
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:44.069 --> 00:45.904
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:46.071 --> 00:48.490
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.574 --> 00:49.908
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.992 --> 00:52.828
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:10.113 --> 02:11.281
<i>Please stand by.</i>

02:11.406 --> 02:14.368
<i>We have an important announcement
regarding the A-Team.</i>

02:14.618 --> 02:17.204
We switch you now to the
briefing room at the Pentagon...

02:17.329 --> 02:18.830
<i>where Colonel Donald Davis...</i>

02:18.956 --> 02:21.291
<i>is making
an official announcement.</i>

02:21.458 --> 02:24.044
The Government of the
United States of America...

02:24.211 --> 02:28.507
has issued a pardon for
Lieutenant Templeton Peck...

02:28.840 --> 02:31.593
Who was formerly sought in
connection with war crimes...

02:31.718 --> 02:33.804
against the Government
of Vietnam.

02:34.429 --> 02:37.099
Through testimony delivered
by Colonel Harvey Miller...

02:37.266 --> 02:40.727
an aide in the General Headquarters
of the IOG Battalion...

02:41.144 --> 02:43.146
it has been learned
that Lieutenant Peck...

02:43.355 --> 02:44.731
was not involved...

02:44.815 --> 02:47.484
with the crimes committed
by The A-Team.

02:47.818 --> 02:49.027
<i>The surprise announcement...</i>

02:49.152 --> 02:50.988
<i>was made at the Pentagon
briefing room...</i>

02:51.071 --> 02:53.323
<i>at 2:00 Eastern Standard Time.</i>

02:53.657 --> 02:56.159
<i>Colonel Harvey Miller
stated in sworn testimony...</i>

02:56.243 --> 02:58.412
<i>before the Adjutant General
in Los Angeles...</i>

02:58.578 --> 03:01.623
<i>that he had witnessed the events
surrounding the capture of the A-Team...</i>

03:01.832 --> 03:05.377
<i>and that Lieutenant Peck had simply been
a passenger on a transport plane...</i>

03:05.544 --> 03:07.671
<i>that led the A-Team
on their mission.</i>

03:08.005 --> 03:09.548
<i>Colonel Miller
will make a statement...</i>

03:09.673 --> 03:12.050
<i>on</i> Meet the Press <i>later today.</i>

03:16.305 --> 03:18.015
What can I say, guys?

03:21.852 --> 03:23.103
<i>Why now, Colonel?</i>

03:23.228 --> 03:25.564
<i>Why wait until now
to release the information?</i>

03:26.398 --> 03:28.817
<i>There were circumstances
surrounding that mission...</i>

03:28.942 --> 03:30.652
<i>that were highly confidential...</i>

03:30.777 --> 03:33.322
<i>and have just recently
been de-classified.</i>

03:33.405 --> 03:35.032
I like this guy.

03:35.198 --> 03:36.700
Don't remember him,
but I like him.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.411
You don't remember Harvey Miller,
that skinny little loot from GHQ...

03:39.494 --> 03:40.871
who used to sell
the black market video tapes?

03:40.996 --> 03:42.914
No, Murdoch. That was
a little red-headed guy.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.251
Does it bother anybody that this
bald-headed bird Colonel...

03:46.418 --> 03:47.753
is flat lying?

03:47.919 --> 03:49.171
Face was assigned to us.

03:49.296 --> 03:51.590
He was second in command
and Supply Officer.

03:51.715 --> 03:54.634
You know, I think that's subject
to interpretation, you know?

03:54.760 --> 03:57.804
I mean, okay, sure, I was a
passenger on that plane.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.848
But you was assigned
to us, Face.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.309
Well, technically maybe.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.853
Face, you scammed
the rocket launchers.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.355
The important thing here is...

04:06.438 --> 04:09.816
that Colonel Miller thinks
I was there by mistake.

04:09.941 --> 04:11.360
The important thing is, guys...

04:11.526 --> 04:13.111
that I am getting pardoned.

04:13.236 --> 04:14.154
Or set up.

04:14.279 --> 04:16.865
Come on, this is my chance
to go out into the world...

04:16.990 --> 04:19.242
and use my heaven-sent
gift of gab...

04:19.326 --> 04:21.495
to accumulate all these...

04:21.661 --> 04:25.457
shallow, purposeless toys
that mankind lusts for.

04:25.582 --> 04:28.293
All right. I'll call
my lawyer, Jerry Eckworth.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.630
He's one of the great legal
snakes in entertainment law.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.715
I mean...

04:33.882 --> 04:36.802
I'll have him check into this
pardon and make sure it's legit.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.638
No, I'm sure it's legit.
I'm due for a break.

04:39.930 --> 04:41.390
Overdue, actually.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.600
Mr. Eckworth, please.
Hannibal Smith.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.603
Come on, guys. Cheer up.

04:46.770 --> 04:48.563
I mean, it's not like
I'm leaving you.

04:48.730 --> 04:49.981
Okay, sure...

04:50.148 --> 04:52.859
I won't have the fun of
galloping through mud holes...

04:52.984 --> 04:54.403
and getting shot at...

04:54.486 --> 04:56.363
but I'll be with you in spirit.

04:56.446 --> 04:58.198
Yeah, we really
gonna miss you, Face.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.659
Face, who's gonna
run our scamolas?

05:00.784 --> 05:04.204
Who's gonna lie to the girl
to get us the free airplane?

05:04.329 --> 05:05.831
Not that we
ever used them, big guy...

05:05.956 --> 05:07.958
but they were always there
in case we needed them.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.961
Face, if you've got a way out of this
mess we're all in, I'm all for it.

05:11.128 --> 05:12.712
But, I don't want
anyone on this team...

05:12.838 --> 05:14.965
getting suckered out into
the open and then captured.

05:15.132 --> 05:17.676
You know, Hannibal,
if Faceman does leave--

05:17.801 --> 05:19.052
I'm not leaving, Murdock.

05:19.177 --> 05:21.513
I'm just gonna be our agent
on the surface, that's all.

05:21.638 --> 05:23.807
As I was saying,
if Faceman does leave...

05:23.890 --> 05:25.851
why can't I be
the new scrounger?

05:25.934 --> 05:29.229
You know, new hair, swank new threads.
I could drive the Vette--

05:29.312 --> 05:32.149
Excuse me, Murdock,
the Vette goes with me.

05:32.274 --> 05:33.191
Oh, Hannibal.

05:33.316 --> 05:34.776
Hello, Jerry.
This is Hannibal.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.362
Yeah, we just heard.

05:37.779 --> 05:39.948
Would you check
this deal out for us?

05:43.160 --> 05:45.662
How can they pardon that lying,
stealing, piece of spit?

05:46.037 --> 05:47.414
He shoots at my men...

05:47.956 --> 05:49.249
robs our ordnance...

05:49.332 --> 05:51.001
and now he's gonna be
laughing in our faces!

05:51.251 --> 05:52.752
What're you gonna
do, General Fulbright?

05:52.919 --> 05:55.130
Decker tried for two years
and couldn't catch them.

05:55.505 --> 05:57.048
Decker was soft.

05:57.674 --> 05:59.259
Decker was never
fully committed...

05:59.426 --> 06:00.844
to the capture of these men!

06:02.262 --> 06:05.599
That's why Decker is now on his
rusty-dusty in Bangor in Maine.

06:07.726 --> 06:10.353
There's a big difference
between me and him, Sergeant.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.106
And you and the other men
in this outfit...

06:13.231 --> 06:15.358
are gonna find it out
very quickly.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.945
Fix the emblem on your collar.
And then you listen up.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.950
When Peck hits the streets...

06:24.367 --> 06:26.828
I'm gonna be on him
like stink on a boot.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.455
Where he goes, I go.

06:28.705 --> 06:30.207
What he does, I do.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.835
And if the A-Team tries
to make contact with him...

06:36.129 --> 06:37.506
we're gonna take them all.

06:37.714 --> 06:39.549
Fulbright's law, Sergeant...

06:45.722 --> 06:47.182
never wait.

06:49.059 --> 06:50.227
Attack.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.396
Well, I'm ready.

06:53.563 --> 06:55.273
Faceman emerges to face...

06:55.398 --> 06:56.942
an unsuspecting world.

06:56.967 --> 06:59.271
Face, we all know there's
something wrong here.

06:59.296 --> 06:59.961
No.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.822
There's a reason all this is
happening that we don't know.

07:02.948 --> 07:04.991
We gotta be careful.
Now take it slow.

07:05.075 --> 07:07.118
No, I don't want you guys
following me. Okay?

07:07.202 --> 07:08.370
I can take care of myself.

07:08.453 --> 07:10.247
Besides, that's just
what Decker would expect.

07:10.413 --> 07:11.623
It'd be dangerous.

07:11.790 --> 07:12.707
Faceman...

07:12.791 --> 07:15.502
you have any last minute
words of advice for me...

07:15.627 --> 07:18.505
before I fill your able
but slimy shoes?

07:18.588 --> 07:19.673
Slimy shoes?

07:19.756 --> 07:22.509
For I will steal. I will lie.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.387
I will seduce my way
down the path...

07:25.679 --> 07:26.805
that you have shown me.

07:26.972 --> 07:28.723
He couldn't scam
yesterday's garbage.

07:28.807 --> 07:31.351
Oh, yeah?
Well, you just watch.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.061
With my new clothes...

07:33.186 --> 07:35.105
and my new manners...

07:35.188 --> 07:37.691
and especially...

07:37.857 --> 07:40.735
my new hair!

07:41.027 --> 07:43.863
I will thrill and amaze us all.

07:43.989 --> 07:45.824
I don't like the sound of that.

07:48.451 --> 07:52.330
Gee, I feel like I'm
running out on you guys. Yeah?

07:52.497 --> 07:54.874
But you have to understand.
This is a pardon.

07:55.166 --> 07:58.086
It's my chance
to start a new life.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.421
Face...

07:59.588 --> 08:02.173
any of us would grab the chance.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.427
B.A...

08:06.177 --> 08:08.513
you take care
of these bums, huh?

08:11.933 --> 08:13.351
I'll do it, man.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.978
And you be careful.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.438
All right, I will.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.691
Well...

08:21.359 --> 08:22.569
I'll see you, guy.

08:22.694 --> 08:24.321
Well...

08:24.613 --> 08:26.114
I'll see you, guy.

08:27.532 --> 08:30.744
Don't try and be me, Murdock. I mean,
it'll just get you in trouble.

08:30.869 --> 08:34.414
Faceman, we all
got to have our idols.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.167
So, now it's just time for
yours truly to step up...

08:37.375 --> 08:38.543
and be initiated.

08:38.668 --> 08:39.669
How about it?

08:41.129 --> 08:43.881
Oh, it's nice, but I'd still
prefer a tall blonde.

08:43.965 --> 08:45.467
Come on, Face.
I'll drop you off.

08:45.550 --> 08:47.847
Oh, I wouldn't
do that, Hannibal.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.513
See, I'm supposed to
pick my pardon up...

08:50.680 --> 08:52.349
at the government
building. So...

08:52.515 --> 08:54.559
And Decker'll probably
be there and...

08:55.101 --> 08:56.728
Well, I called a cab.

09:01.399 --> 09:02.525
So...

09:03.526 --> 09:04.986
stay in touch.

09:10.575 --> 09:13.495
He's walking
into something. I know it.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.877
Have you contacted
our people on the street?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.170
They have been alerted.

09:22.337 --> 09:23.838
But it is our feeling
that this man...

09:24.005 --> 09:26.049
will be under constant
government surveillance.

09:26.424 --> 09:28.593
At first, then,
he will be hard to locate.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.762
He will be cautious,
unsure of his freedom--

09:30.845 --> 09:32.222
You will find him.

09:33.098 --> 09:35.433
No amount of money is too much.

09:35.684 --> 09:39.312
He robbed me of my only real
valuable possession in life.

09:39.437 --> 09:42.357
You will find him and bring him to me.
Do you understand?

09:46.569 --> 09:47.862
Lieutenant Peck.

09:48.029 --> 09:49.823
Charlene Cross, LA Dispatch.

09:49.948 --> 09:52.409
Were you surprised by Colonel
Miller's announcement?

09:52.575 --> 09:54.536
Well, Charlie...

09:54.911 --> 09:55.995
Well...

09:56.079 --> 09:58.039
it's not Lieutenant anymore.

09:58.123 --> 10:01.418
You know, it's just plain,
old Templeton Peck.

10:01.584 --> 10:02.961
You know, private citizen.

10:03.628 --> 10:04.838
Hi, there.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.589
Are you with the peacock?

10:06.756 --> 10:08.383
Toni Somerset, NBC News.

10:08.550 --> 10:10.009
How do you feel
about the allegations...

10:10.093 --> 10:13.263
that you ran a large illegal club
for officers and enlisted men...

10:13.388 --> 10:15.932
called the DMZ Tennis
and Racquetball Club?

10:16.099 --> 10:18.977
I just felt
that the fighting man...

10:19.144 --> 10:21.896
needed some recreation.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.690
So, I...

10:23.857 --> 10:25.859
I poured a few tennis courts...

10:26.025 --> 10:27.527
and put in some racquetball...

10:27.610 --> 10:30.071
had the Seabees
dig a swimming pool.

10:31.114 --> 10:32.574
Yes, and, well, I...

10:32.657 --> 10:34.993
It wasn't the Bel Air
Sports Connection...

10:35.118 --> 10:38.955
but it got us through
some very tough times.

10:39.164 --> 10:42.292
Well, look, I'd like to stand
here and answer your questions...

10:42.375 --> 10:46.296
but, well, I think there's
an Adjutant General inside...

10:46.379 --> 10:50.008
with a piece of paper that I've
been looking for, for 12 years.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.469
Well, thank you all.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.596
Look, I'll have a formal
press conference...

10:54.721 --> 10:56.890
later at the hotel
and we'll do this right.

10:56.973 --> 10:59.976
You know, champagne, finger sandwiches.
The whole ball of wax.

11:00.143 --> 11:02.187
All right? Ciao, thank you.

11:05.315 --> 11:06.775
You having nice day, Peck.

11:08.485 --> 11:10.111
- Who are you?
- Fulbright...

11:10.195 --> 11:11.529
General Harlan Fulbright.

11:11.654 --> 11:13.823
"Bull" Fulbright. The...

11:13.990 --> 11:16.326
The terror of Toledo.

11:16.451 --> 11:18.203
Well, well, well...

11:18.328 --> 11:20.330
and what are you doing
here, General?

11:20.497 --> 11:23.208
I'm here to squash you and all
the slime you run around with.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.126
You see, I know
who you really are.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.169
A war hero...

11:26.252 --> 11:29.297
unjustly charged
with crimes he didn't commit.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.465
Not even close.

11:30.632 --> 11:33.510
You're garbage that got
wrapped up in a nice package.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.345
Get out of my way, General.

11:35.553 --> 11:39.432
Or I will have a writ of
harassment on your desk...

11:39.724 --> 11:41.643
before the sun goes down.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.284
Well, well.

11:58.368 --> 12:00.995
E.G. Fowler, with Limelight
Management Incorporated.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.747
- I'd like to represent you...
- Excuse me.

12:02.831 --> 12:04.541
- ...if you aren't already spoken for.
- Cary Carlton, Atlanta Affiliate.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.334
- Could we do a little standup piece right here?
- Come on, Cary. No.

12:06.417 --> 12:08.503
- We can't favor one affiliate.
- Just something short.

12:08.586 --> 12:10.922
Don't worry, you'll get
your chance. Call my office.

12:11.047 --> 12:13.174
Oh, sorry, guys,
you heard the lady...

12:13.341 --> 12:15.385
and I take my orders like a man.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.514
Wow, you're pretty good.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.559
Look, PR people are gonna be
coming at you in assault waves.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.143
Now, here is my deal.

12:24.269 --> 12:27.021
$2,500 a week.
Expenses are split.

12:27.105 --> 12:29.399
I know you're probably
short of cash now.

12:29.524 --> 12:32.443
So I'll do
the first week on account.

12:32.694 --> 12:35.238
By then, if I've done my job...

12:35.363 --> 12:39.367
you'll have book advances
and TV appearance money...

12:39.576 --> 12:42.203
and maybe even
the film rights sold.

12:42.287 --> 12:43.788
What did you say
your name was, again?

12:43.913 --> 12:45.039
E.G. Fowler.

12:45.164 --> 12:48.418
Well, E.G., throw in
a dinner for a hungry boy...

12:48.543 --> 12:49.961
and you got yourself a deal.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.212
Lieutenant Peck...

12:51.462 --> 12:53.548
this way, please.
The Governor is waiting.

13:02.599 --> 13:03.766
Listen to this.

13:03.892 --> 13:05.977
"On his career in Vietnam...

13:06.102 --> 13:07.854
"Lieutenant Peck stated...

13:08.062 --> 13:10.231
"that his
entrepreneurial interests...

13:10.356 --> 13:14.068
"tended to overshadow
his military accomplishments.

13:14.235 --> 13:17.363
"He and the ordinary members
of his team--"

13:17.530 --> 13:19.782
That's us, his team.
I love it.

13:19.949 --> 13:21.993
"...took several
enemy positions...

13:22.076 --> 13:24.662
"deemed impossible to capture...

13:24.746 --> 13:26.706
"by high-ranking brass.

13:26.873 --> 13:30.501
"His sure-footed leadership
under fire, Peck stated...

13:30.585 --> 13:32.921
"helped to bring
the team back alive."

13:33.087 --> 13:35.757
Hey, Hannibal, what was you doing
when all this was happening?

13:35.924 --> 13:39.010
I guess I was having cocktails
at Face's tennis club.

13:40.011 --> 13:40.970
Listen...

13:41.137 --> 13:44.766
"Peck is currently negotiating
with several publishers...

13:44.933 --> 13:47.101
"and motion picture studios...

13:47.226 --> 13:49.062
"for the rights
to his new book...

13:49.228 --> 13:50.897
<i>”Pecking Away at the System.”</i>

13:51.147 --> 13:52.315
Catchy title.

13:53.483 --> 13:56.402
Gee, if they make a movie of it, I
wonder who they'd get to play me.

13:56.611 --> 13:58.696
You know, Hannibal,
the way things are going...

13:58.780 --> 14:00.865
you might not even be
mentioned in the movie.

14:11.376 --> 14:12.835
Is that Murdock?

14:23.888 --> 14:25.848
Gosh, Hannibal, I...

14:26.099 --> 14:29.143
I was with this bilingual...

14:29.310 --> 14:30.812
primo foxette.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.438
We were making ten
with a bullet...

14:32.563 --> 14:34.691
and I had to drop everything!

14:34.816 --> 14:37.276
Pile into the Vette
and race across town.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.569
I mean, couldn't it wait?

14:38.695 --> 14:39.779
Oh, brother.

14:39.862 --> 14:42.657
Brothers are your bag, not me.

14:42.824 --> 14:45.868
I'm into sisters and their
mothers, if they're under 40.

14:46.035 --> 14:47.745
Why don't you cut it out,
fool. I've had enough of this.

14:47.870 --> 14:50.707
My name is not fool.
I am the Hunk Man.

14:50.832 --> 14:52.083
You got it, boys and girls?

14:52.208 --> 14:53.292
The Hunker.

14:53.418 --> 14:55.894
Look at that Vette over there.
Why, it fits me like...

14:57.011 --> 14:59.215
...a pair of argyle socks.

14:59.340 --> 15:00.258
I mean, I love it.

15:00.383 --> 15:03.094
This is what life
is supposed to be about.

15:03.177 --> 15:04.679
It's coming apart, Hannibal.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.181
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

15:12.770 --> 15:15.898
I don't know, E.G. It's...

15:16.315 --> 15:18.776
It's like a whole new
world opening up to me.

15:18.901 --> 15:21.529
Well, if we do this right, it
should only be the beginning.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.824
You do seem to have a natural
charm with the press.

15:25.241 --> 15:27.035
But, Face, I really must--

15:27.118 --> 15:29.203
Let's drop that moniker.

15:29.912 --> 15:32.331
Now Templeton is the name.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.916
Actually...

15:34.042 --> 15:37.670
your name originally was...

15:37.837 --> 15:39.380
Alvin Brenner.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.175
Then you had it legally
changed to Al Brennan...

15:42.300 --> 15:44.218
then to Al Peck.

15:44.510 --> 15:48.056
Then to Holmes Morrison,
then to Morrison Holmes...

15:48.181 --> 15:50.224
and then to Templeton Peck.

15:52.769 --> 15:54.645
Where did you get this?

15:54.854 --> 15:56.314
From the writer I hired.

15:56.397 --> 15:59.317
He did extensive
background research.

15:59.484 --> 16:01.277
He's waiting to hear from you.

16:01.402 --> 16:03.071
He's got the first
three chapters ready...

16:03.237 --> 16:04.781
and they are going
to be delivered tonight.

16:04.947 --> 16:07.992
We promised the publisher we'd
have the book done in two weeks...

16:08.076 --> 16:10.161
to cash in
on this peak publicity.

16:10.244 --> 16:11.120
Look...

16:11.204 --> 16:14.832
let's slough all this stuff
about the aliases.

16:14.916 --> 16:16.459
What's in a name?

16:17.335 --> 16:20.046
Funny question
coming from a guy...

16:20.213 --> 16:22.173
who's had so many.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.677
What do you want to do about this
children's workshop booking?

16:26.886 --> 16:30.264
Chuck-a-Luck the Chicken wants
you as a guest on his show.

16:30.473 --> 16:32.266
<i>Barnyard Ballyhoo.</i>

16:32.600 --> 16:33.684
Let's book it.

16:33.851 --> 16:36.229
I like the big chicken.
He's got panache.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.941
Besides, it'll be good for my
two to eleven demographics.

16:40.024 --> 16:43.569
You know, for a talker,
you're remarkably sexy.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.823
I generally find
talkers very boring.

16:47.406 --> 16:50.034
Well, I also have a quiet,
thoughtful side.

16:50.201 --> 16:51.661
I love poetry.

16:51.828 --> 16:54.372
I'm a very good dancer
and I can quote...

16:54.539 --> 16:57.875
romantic passages
from Shakespeare, Bacon...

16:58.084 --> 16:59.460
Faulkner...

16:59.836 --> 17:03.214
and Lord Byron.

17:05.508 --> 17:07.218
<i>Bet you're asking
yourself right now...</i>

17:07.343 --> 17:09.303
<i>who is this great looking guy?</i>

17:09.428 --> 17:11.138
And how can I talk him
into taking me out?

17:11.222 --> 17:13.723
Well, that's right.
I'm the guy of your dreams.

17:13.849 --> 17:16.018
I mean, I bet you noticed me...

17:16.144 --> 17:19.480
getting out of that fancy new
Vette over there. Right?

17:20.522 --> 17:23.067
I mean, I love fish...

17:23.233 --> 17:24.819
especially the whales.

17:24.902 --> 17:26.820
I belong to Greenpeace...

17:27.029 --> 17:29.532
the Cousteau Society,
Save the Whales.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.576
I mean, the ocean.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.035
That's where it's happening.

17:33.161 --> 17:36.497
So, how about an egg salad
sandwich, two jellyrolls...

17:36.581 --> 17:38.416
and a Twinkie six-pack to go?

17:38.499 --> 17:39.834
Oh, you have to go.

17:40.334 --> 17:41.294
I can dig it.

17:41.836 --> 17:43.004
Well, I...

17:43.921 --> 17:47.508
Yeah, I'll catch you
on the flip side.

17:50.511 --> 17:52.054
Don't know what I did wrong.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.103
Where's our breakfast, Hunk?

17:59.604 --> 18:02.064
We were hitting it off...

18:02.190 --> 18:04.358
but she got an emergency call.

18:04.525 --> 18:06.819
You came on to her, and she
took off with our breakfast.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.946
That is a very narrow...

18:09.071 --> 18:11.199
and selfish interpretation.

18:11.365 --> 18:13.075
Okay, let's go guys.
There's Face.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.036
I'll catch you on the...

18:15.119 --> 18:16.537
No, I already said that.

18:17.622 --> 18:20.041
This is getting to be tiresome.

18:33.512 --> 18:36.390
Hey, Hannibal, you think somebody'll
try to do something to Faceman?

18:36.599 --> 18:38.226
We've got nothing else to do.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.978
I wanna be sure
he's gonna be okay.

18:41.604 --> 18:43.356
Press breakfast.

18:43.773 --> 18:44.857
Look...

18:44.982 --> 18:48.694
I hope we're not fooling
around with local press here.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.406
No, no. I'd rather stick
with the networks.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.159
You know, A.P., UPI...

18:55.284 --> 18:57.036
The Unified News Bureau.

18:57.161 --> 19:00.414
You don't want to let this fame and
celebrity go to your head, Templeton.

19:00.581 --> 19:02.667
Me? Come on, E.G...

19:02.792 --> 19:04.293
I'm just people.

19:04.460 --> 19:06.337
I'm just plain folks.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.757
You know, maybe we should
duck Chuck-A-Luck.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.009
I don't know.
There's something about...

19:12.176 --> 19:14.220
sitting around,
talking with a chicken.

19:14.303 --> 19:18.432
You know, it may not be the class
image that we're going for.

19:32.196 --> 19:33.864
Ranger One to Ranger Five.

19:34.031 --> 19:35.992
They just passed us,
heading east.

19:36.284 --> 19:38.869
Black van with the red
stripe is right on them.

19:38.995 --> 19:40.121
<i>No sign of the red Vette.</i>

19:40.246 --> 19:42.540
Okay, pick off the black van.

19:42.623 --> 19:44.041
- We don't want them.
- <i>Got it.</i>

19:44.208 --> 19:45.918
Converge and apprehend.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.099
Don't let them get away, B.A.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.401
City drivers.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.153
It's frightening.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.573
I could get killed just as
I become a hot property.

20:16.365 --> 20:17.742
I gotta be careful.

21:04.955 --> 21:07.708
<i>Come out with your hands up...</i>

21:07.833 --> 21:09.668
<i>or we'll open fire!</i>

21:11.295 --> 21:14.298
When your timing goes,
seems like nothing goes right.

21:14.590 --> 21:16.384
Yeah, I think
they got us, Hannibal.

21:16.717 --> 21:18.511
Wanna go see
what they got for lunch.

21:34.151 --> 21:37.655
Oh, we're in real trouble now,
boys and girls.

22:03.013 --> 22:04.682
Take off the blindfolds.

22:08.269 --> 22:09.854
Piece of advice.

22:10.187 --> 22:12.731
Don't mess around in something
that isn't your business.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.900
Now, that's great advice.
I'll take it.

22:15.025 --> 22:18.404
Is there anything else, or did you just
kidnap us to be sure we'd listen up?

22:18.487 --> 22:19.738
Sit on them.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.949
I don't want these two
in the play.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.757
Let's use our little thumbs
and our forefingers...

22:38.883 --> 22:40.926
and get those weapons out now!

22:50.728 --> 22:52.021
All right, you with the beard...

22:52.188 --> 22:53.439
off with the cuffs.

22:53.689 --> 22:55.608
Murdock, for the first time,
I'm glad to see you.

22:55.733 --> 22:58.402
That's Hunk or Hunk Man to you.

22:58.569 --> 23:00.446
Hannibal, there are still
two guys outside.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.865
I suggest, we depart quickly.

23:36.774 --> 23:38.567
John Jones.

23:38.692 --> 23:41.487
Height, 5'11", 175 pounds.

23:41.862 --> 23:45.199
Weight medium, complexion
medium, everything medium.

23:45.282 --> 23:47.493
Well, it's
Mr. National Average.

23:47.576 --> 23:50.788
You know, but I hate to state
the obvious, Hannibal...

23:50.913 --> 23:52.998
but you don't get
haircuts like that...

23:53.123 --> 23:54.291
at Chez David.

23:54.375 --> 23:55.626
Right, Murdock.

23:55.918 --> 23:58.337
They're government spooks,
it's a fake John Jones.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.172
Nobody is called John Jones.

24:00.297 --> 24:02.424
You know, that house we
were at was for sale.

24:03.592 --> 24:05.844
Limelight Homes.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.764
We'll give them a ring. See if
they gave the key to anybody.

24:08.889 --> 24:11.475
Doesn't Face's PR lady
work for a firm called...

24:11.642 --> 24:13.435
Limelight Management?

24:14.019 --> 24:16.689
Well, it could be a coincidence.

24:16.814 --> 24:19.817
Just government economy. They
may only have one stencil.

24:19.942 --> 24:22.444
Let's give
Limelight Management a ring...

24:22.528 --> 24:24.154
and see what we come up with.

24:25.739 --> 24:27.241
Yes, information.

24:27.366 --> 24:28.492
That's right.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.286
Yeah, I got it.

24:30.411 --> 24:31.870
Say, information...

24:31.996 --> 24:34.123
while I got you
on the line here...

24:34.248 --> 24:36.208
I mean, you sound like
a groovy chickla...

24:36.375 --> 24:38.419
and I'm a six-foot,
square-jawed bundle of fun.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.963
I got a Vette, it's hot.
I like to talk about...

24:41.046 --> 24:43.549
whales. I like sushi...

24:43.716 --> 24:44.883
and sharing.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.511
Perhaps, I could squeeze you...

24:47.594 --> 24:49.763
into my date-filled
calendar book.

24:49.847 --> 24:53.142
Shall we say, Friday? Eight--

24:54.977 --> 24:56.603
Must have got cut off.

24:56.687 --> 24:59.106
She hung up on you. You
insulting these women.

24:59.398 --> 25:00.316
Well...

25:00.399 --> 25:03.444
as we say in the better health
clubs of the West side...

25:03.819 --> 25:05.154
"Ask not, get not."

25:05.279 --> 25:07.156
Murdock, better give me the
number, I'll make the call.

25:07.281 --> 25:08.782
Hannibal, please.

25:09.074 --> 25:10.367
I can do this.
I really can.

25:10.451 --> 25:12.828
You'd let Faceman do it,
why not Hunk Man?

25:12.911 --> 25:13.996
Because you will mess it up.

25:14.079 --> 25:16.999
But I can do voices
just like Faceman.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.792
I can do Sylvester the Cat.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.544
Listen here, sweetheart...

25:20.627 --> 25:23.130
this pussycat knows
where his fur is parted.

25:23.213 --> 25:25.299
I can do Bullwinkle.

25:25.549 --> 25:29.428
Oh, look,
I'm knee-deep in pretzels, poopie.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.472
I can do Henry Kissinger.

25:31.555 --> 25:35.476
Hello, this is Henry Kissinger.

25:35.851 --> 25:37.811
That might work. Try it.

25:37.895 --> 25:38.729
<i>Yeah?</i>

25:38.896 --> 25:41.440
Sir, it's Henry Kissinger.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.859
He wants to talk
to Templeton Peck.

25:45.944 --> 25:47.279
Yes, who is this please?

25:47.404 --> 25:50.657
Well, I was just
getting ready to ask you the same question.

25:50.741 --> 25:53.911
However,
this is Henry Kissinger.

25:54.078 --> 25:57.790
Mr. Kissinger.
Hi, this is David Vaughn.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.375
I don't know
if you remember me...

25:59.458 --> 26:03.253
but we met at the Central Intelligence
Agency bomb briefings in '67.

26:03.337 --> 26:04.380
Yes. David.

26:04.546 --> 26:09.259
What a great pleasure it is
to be speaking to you...

26:09.343 --> 26:12.888
and I wonder if you could
help me with a problem.

26:13.013 --> 26:17.101
I have desperately been trying
to locate Templeton Peck.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.727
I would like to invite him...

26:18.852 --> 26:22.898
to a Friars Club
roast in his honor.

26:23.023 --> 26:24.191
Well...

26:24.316 --> 26:27.736
he's busy all afternoon
doing political interviews.

26:27.861 --> 26:29.321
Can't he call you?

26:30.280 --> 26:35.119
Well, I am at the VIP lounge
at the...

26:39.832 --> 26:41.625
What was that? I'm sorry.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.211
Excuse me, I didn't get that.

26:44.378 --> 26:46.713
Well, you could try him
at the Vine Street Studio.

26:46.797 --> 26:48.632
He's has an interview there
this afternoon.

26:48.799 --> 26:51.844
Oh, thank you
very much, David...

26:51.927 --> 26:53.971
for all of your courtesy.

26:54.054 --> 26:58.058
So remember,
Nancy Ramsey says hizy-wizy.

26:58.809 --> 27:01.353
Well, hi back to her.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.440
Good. Good. Good.

27:08.277 --> 27:09.736
It's CIA.

27:09.945 --> 27:11.488
It figures.
Where's Face?

27:11.613 --> 27:12.948
He's at the Vine Street Studio.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.658
Some kind of big
political interview.

27:14.741 --> 27:17.536
That's right,
Chuck-A-Luck, it was tough.

27:17.661 --> 27:19.830
But, you know,
when things are tough...

27:19.913 --> 27:21.540
sometimes it makes you
a better man.

27:21.665 --> 27:24.793
Boy, that's
really interesting, Faceman.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.421
My barnyard friends...

27:27.504 --> 27:28.922
were telling me
just the other day...

27:29.089 --> 27:31.508
that when they were accused
of something they didn't do...

27:31.633 --> 27:35.262
it was really tough
because they got very angry.

27:35.345 --> 27:36.972
Thanks, Faceman.

27:37.139 --> 27:39.224
We'll be right back.

27:42.853 --> 27:44.104
Face. Face.

27:44.229 --> 27:46.356
Oh, hi. We're right in the
middle of an interview.

27:46.482 --> 27:47.941
That's it for me.

27:48.025 --> 27:49.485
Thank you, very much.

27:49.651 --> 27:51.487
I'm
out of here for lunch, cowboy.

27:51.653 --> 27:52.863
Great guy, huh?

27:53.030 --> 27:55.616
Or bird, or whatever.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.794
Yeah, he asked some very
interesting questions.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.964
You know, some of these
interviewers, they're so boring.

28:11.507 --> 28:15.052
All they wanna know about
is all your heroic exploits.

28:15.177 --> 28:16.094
Face...

28:16.220 --> 28:18.388
can you let the air out of
your head for a minute...

28:18.472 --> 28:20.432
and listen to us?
- Yeah.

28:20.516 --> 28:23.644
We were just picked up
by a squad of guys...

28:23.769 --> 28:26.104
in gray civvies who took us...

28:26.188 --> 28:28.190
to a garage in the valley.

28:28.607 --> 28:30.234
Now, they
didn't want to bust us.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.027
They just wanted
to keep us out of the way.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.280
Something's going down and
you are in the center of it.

28:35.405 --> 28:36.740
I appreciate the concern.

28:36.823 --> 28:40.118
You know, the CIA, they probably
wanna keep an eye on me.

28:40.410 --> 28:43.121
Why? Don't make
no sense to me.

28:43.413 --> 28:45.832
Yeah, well, none of this
makes much sense, B.A...

28:45.916 --> 28:47.751
but sure is fun.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.838
Gee, guys, things are going
so great, I mean...

28:52.130 --> 28:54.591
if you only knew
what it was like.

28:54.716 --> 28:57.970
I mean,
people want my autograph.

28:58.136 --> 29:01.056
Everywhere I go people,
they wanna know...

29:01.181 --> 29:02.724
what I think about stuff.

29:02.849 --> 29:05.269
Like that big chicken there.

29:05.394 --> 29:07.312
Right. Right, like him.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.047
Yeah. And, oh...

29:09.072 --> 29:10.394
the women.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.551
The women!

29:12.943 --> 29:14.069
See...

29:14.152 --> 29:16.738
E.G., she's winding up
some stuff.

29:16.863 --> 29:18.448
I'd be careful about her, Face.

29:18.574 --> 29:19.658
Of E.G.?

29:19.783 --> 29:22.286
Are you kidding?
I mean, she set this all up.

29:22.369 --> 29:23.704
We're gonna
have to charter a jet.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.289
Just to get to all the gigs.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.291
"I knew my buddies
wouldn't make it without me.

29:27.457 --> 29:29.126
"The Delta was
clogged with VC...

29:29.209 --> 29:31.962
"and, armed only with my knife
and my wits, I went back--"

29:32.045 --> 29:34.256
Yeah, that's right.
Well, it's--

29:34.339 --> 29:35.507
When was that, Face?

29:35.632 --> 29:38.135
Oh, well, this... That's just
the first draft, you see.

29:38.218 --> 29:40.137
Yeah, I haven't had a chance
to rewrite it yet.

29:40.220 --> 29:42.180
I mean, things
are happening so fast.

29:42.306 --> 29:44.349
And this writer
he exaggerates everything.

29:44.474 --> 29:46.685
Of course, if we're going
to get Bob to play me.

29:46.768 --> 29:47.853
You know, we're gonna have to...

29:47.936 --> 29:50.981
center it on the Faceman
character slightly.

29:51.398 --> 29:52.649
Bob who?

29:52.983 --> 29:54.067
Redford.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.570
And who plays me, Face?

29:56.737 --> 29:58.697
You? Oh, well...

29:58.822 --> 30:02.117
your character's been scaled
down slightly, Hannibal.

30:02.284 --> 30:03.410
You're not in it, Hannibal.

30:03.493 --> 30:05.495
Of course, he's in it, B.A.

30:05.579 --> 30:08.999
He's just not what we call
a focal character. See?

30:09.166 --> 30:10.500
Now, look, guys...

30:10.667 --> 30:14.004
my schedule is really pressing.
So, if you'll just--

30:14.129 --> 30:15.172
Face.

30:15.756 --> 30:19.509
You've gotta get off this ego trip,
Lieutenant. You're in danger.

30:19.593 --> 30:22.054
Right, I'm in danger
of missing my 3:00.

30:22.179 --> 30:25.432
Oh, come on, guys,
what could happen to me?

30:25.599 --> 30:29.478
I mean, I have people around
me every second of the day.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.773
And believe me, Hannibal,
I am very good at security.

30:32.939 --> 30:34.358
All my antennae are out.

30:34.524 --> 30:36.818
Now, look, guys,
I gotta go. Really, gotta go.

30:36.943 --> 30:38.320
Thanks for
stopping by. Really.

30:38.487 --> 30:39.655
Looking great, Murdock.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.948
Oh, and I'll send you all
autographed copies of the book.

30:42.074 --> 30:45.494
You know, and don't worry about that
little piece of nonsense that B.A. read.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.330
I'll straighten that dippy writer out.
Really. Trust me.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.082
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

30:51.917 --> 30:55.087
Boy, is he on an ego trip.

30:55.462 --> 31:00.300
But we're all gonna get autographed
copies of his book, guys.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.556
No numbers.

31:47.723 --> 31:50.350
We should have stayed closer to
him whether he wanted us or not.

32:08.034 --> 32:10.287
I'd like to see your Chief
Executive Officer, please.

32:10.370 --> 32:12.581
I'm interested in looking
at all the parcels of land...

32:12.706 --> 32:15.000
you represent on the west side
of town of $5 million and up.

32:15.208 --> 32:17.836
You'd need to speak to Mr. Gilbert.
Who should I say is calling?

32:17.961 --> 32:19.129
Hugh Howland.

32:19.337 --> 32:21.173
Hugh Howland Industries.

32:21.423 --> 32:22.799
Thank you.

32:26.678 --> 32:27.804
Well...

32:28.847 --> 32:30.724
you must be Mr. Gilbert.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.101
That's right. How can I help you, Mr.
Howland?

32:33.351 --> 32:36.271
Well, I buy properties.
Large parcels of property.

32:36.438 --> 32:37.939
Up to 100 acres.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.025
We're the hotel people,
you know.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.319
Well, this is a nice, little
shop you got here, Mr. Gilbert.

32:42.444 --> 32:43.445
You got a first name?

32:43.570 --> 32:45.697
Sir, I'm afraid we don't
handle large tracts.

32:45.781 --> 32:47.240
Oh. What do you handle?

32:47.365 --> 32:49.075
Well, we work
on a build-to-suit basis.

32:49.159 --> 32:50.577
- Working for--
- Build-to-suit?

32:50.660 --> 32:52.412
Working for clients
who have special needs...

32:52.579 --> 32:54.206
generally small manufacturing.

32:55.957 --> 32:58.126
Excuse me, sir. Wait a minute.
Where you going?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.336
Is there something wrong?

32:59.503 --> 33:01.880
Well, I was just trying to tell
you that I think you should go...

33:01.963 --> 33:03.757
to a traditional
real estate company.

33:03.924 --> 33:05.425
We just don't handle
that kind of property.

33:05.509 --> 33:07.219
Well, what do you handle?
Maybe I could buy some.

33:07.302 --> 33:10.305
You got any good residential? Always
got my eye out for prime residential.

33:10.430 --> 33:13.058
Look, Mr. Howland, we're not doing
residential real estate, either.

33:13.141 --> 33:15.185
It's factories built-to-suit.

33:15.644 --> 33:17.354
Like I said,
it's all very specialized.

33:17.479 --> 33:19.272
Well, goodbye, son.

33:19.439 --> 33:22.317
Good luck and cheer up.

33:26.363 --> 33:27.697
This is the place.

33:27.781 --> 33:30.700
David Vaughn is in there along
with a couple of others we know.

33:30.784 --> 33:32.661
It is not a real estate office.

33:32.786 --> 33:34.204
It is a front.

33:34.287 --> 33:35.914
What do you want
from the old Hunker?

33:36.039 --> 33:37.415
Nothing right now.

33:37.499 --> 33:41.169
We're gonna wait till Mr. Vaughn goes
somewhere he won't be disturbed...

33:41.336 --> 33:44.589
and then we're gonna
pay him a visit.

33:45.131 --> 33:46.466
Yeah.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.061
Are we all set up out at
this farm in Valencia?

33:58.186 --> 34:00.730
Yeah. They've still got Peck out
there but Chow hasn't shown up.

34:00.856 --> 34:02.440
Keep a chopper ready.

34:02.691 --> 34:05.527
If Chow dies in the shootout,
it's not gonna break my heart.

34:05.610 --> 34:06.570
And what about Peck?

34:06.695 --> 34:08.905
He's nothing
but the cheese in the trap.

34:09.322 --> 34:11.533
If the rat eats the cheese,
what do we care...

34:11.616 --> 34:13.577
so long as the trap gets sprung.

34:35.681 --> 34:38.476
Well, it's done.
They picked up your boy.

34:39.603 --> 34:43.063
What's this, E.G.?
Is this contempt or anger?

34:43.607 --> 34:46.275
Oh, don't tell me we're
getting soft about targets.

34:46.359 --> 34:48.527
Oh, shut up, David.

34:50.196 --> 34:51.947
Maybe you should
go back to Operations...

34:52.032 --> 34:54.034
if you can't take it
out here in the field.

34:54.242 --> 34:56.786
Sometimes I just
don't like what we do.

34:57.454 --> 34:59.372
If this guy is General Chow...

34:59.456 --> 35:01.666
we'll be bagging one of the
biggest war criminals...

35:01.750 --> 35:02.751
in the last decade.

35:02.876 --> 35:03.919
Well, what about Temp?

35:04.002 --> 35:09.049
Oh, it's Temp now, is it? I thought he
was just an expendable, wanted felon.

35:09.215 --> 35:11.134
He got caught up in this mess.

35:11.384 --> 35:14.804
I spent two days making him
feel like Mick Jagger.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.390
He's overloaded on helium.

35:17.974 --> 35:21.186
I'd hate to see you
under similar circumstances.

35:21.478 --> 35:23.355
Okay, that's your debriefing.

35:23.521 --> 35:26.358
Get lost.
You're excused. Go.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.416
B.A.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.962
Hey. Hey!

35:49.464 --> 35:51.466
What are you-- Hey!

35:53.885 --> 35:55.470
Hey! What are you doing?

35:55.595 --> 35:57.889
Hey, let me go!

36:01.351 --> 36:02.519
What are you doing?

36:02.644 --> 36:04.229
Hey! Let me go!

36:05.438 --> 36:07.023
I'll tell you anything.

36:07.190 --> 36:10.026
Anything.
I'll tell you anything.

36:15.991 --> 36:18.410
Are you guys crazy?
I could have been killed!

36:19.285 --> 36:22.038
Well, let's put this thing
back on the ground.

36:22.706 --> 36:24.040
Right now.

36:24.290 --> 36:26.418
You hijacked me.
You shot at me.

36:26.584 --> 36:29.713
You were involved with
kidnapping one of my team.

36:29.879 --> 36:31.923
I'm not gonna play around
with you, pal.

36:32.132 --> 36:33.925
You come clean right now...

36:34.092 --> 36:36.845
or you spend the rest of the afternoon
counting your broken teeth.

36:36.970 --> 36:40.140
It's a secret unit known as The Shop.
That's all I can tell you.

36:40.223 --> 36:42.642
- Except you don't wanna mess with us.
- Oh yes, I do.

36:42.726 --> 36:45.061
I'm a nutburger.
I have no fear of death.

36:45.186 --> 36:47.439
I may be a homicidal maniac.

36:47.564 --> 36:50.483
If I were you, pal,
I'd come clean.

36:50.567 --> 36:52.318
I could charm it out of him.

36:52.402 --> 36:53.695
Or I could beat it out of him.

36:53.820 --> 36:57.741
Equally unappetizing notions,
Mr. Vaughn, I assure you.

36:58.658 --> 37:00.493
- Go ahead, B.A.
- No.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.787
Just hold it.

37:04.664 --> 37:08.376
During the war, there was a
Vietcong general named Chow.

37:08.710 --> 37:10.295
We think
he's in this country now...

37:10.378 --> 37:13.173
operating as the head
of an Asian trading company.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.508
- So bust him.
- We can't prove it.

37:15.759 --> 37:19.137
We don't have fingerprints, a detailed
record, just some old photographs.

37:19.262 --> 37:21.056
We're trying to lure him
into the open.

37:21.181 --> 37:23.183
Get him to make
a criminal movement.

37:23.266 --> 37:24.601
What's this got to do with Face?

37:24.684 --> 37:25.894
We have good intelligence...

37:26.019 --> 37:29.606
that General Chow hated violently
a man named Templeton Peck.

37:29.689 --> 37:33.860
Some Cong general
hated Peck? Why?

37:33.943 --> 37:35.487
Chow!

37:35.570 --> 37:38.531
That is the name of the girl
who ran the leather shop...

37:38.615 --> 37:39.657
at Face's tennis club.

37:39.824 --> 37:42.827
She ran away from home. Peck shielded
her and then he dishonored her.

37:42.952 --> 37:45.163
Oh, hold it. I was there.
He never touched her.

37:45.246 --> 37:46.581
She was just a sweet little kid.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.666
Does it really matter
what the facts are?

37:48.875 --> 37:50.001
The whole thing is...

37:50.085 --> 37:53.671
we had to get Peck above ground so
we could see what would happen.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.173
They picked him up
this afternoon.

37:55.298 --> 37:57.717
- Where is he?
- He's out at a ranch in Valencia.

37:57.801 --> 38:00.512
How do you know?
We had a mini transmitter...

38:00.595 --> 38:03.515
in the brads of the manuscript we gave
Lieutenant Peck and then we followed him.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.809
<i>Pecking Away At The System.</i>

38:05.934 --> 38:08.269
I had such high hopes
for that book.

38:08.853 --> 38:10.730
- What's that?
- That's CIA issue.

38:10.855 --> 38:11.940
It's a jet pack.

38:12.065 --> 38:14.150
I'm supposed to deliver it
to my agents in the field.

38:14.234 --> 38:18.822
Colonel, I think we should
take this with us.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.406
Good idea, Captain.

38:21.574 --> 38:23.034
What about you, Miss Fowler?

38:23.159 --> 38:26.955
I want to help. I know it's hard to
believe but I really like your friend.

38:27.789 --> 38:29.707
I just hope he's safe.

38:31.584 --> 38:35.588
If you guys could just tell me
what you want, okay?

38:36.089 --> 38:40.093
Oh, come on, deals can
be struck on anything.

38:40.635 --> 38:41.761
Really.

38:42.303 --> 38:45.390
Yeah, you see, the whole art
of negotiation...

38:45.473 --> 38:49.519
is the realization that no
position is unattainable.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.314
You know any good jokes?

38:54.023 --> 38:55.942
You wanna sing some songs?

38:57.986 --> 39:02.365
Well, maybe I'll just hold it
down for a little while.

39:11.708 --> 39:12.959
Okay...

39:13.251 --> 39:15.461
time for
a little military strategy.

39:15.545 --> 39:16.671
Now, who said...

39:16.796 --> 39:20.133
"Only use the air to create areas
of opportunity on the ground"?

39:20.258 --> 39:21.676
Patton, General George.

39:21.843 --> 39:24.304
That was football coach
Woody Hayes, fool.

39:24.470 --> 39:25.722
Right, B.A.

39:25.930 --> 39:27.140
Now, Murdock...

39:27.348 --> 39:30.935
take your little gas machine
and this bag of grenades...

39:31.102 --> 39:32.770
and when that chopper
comes in...

39:32.937 --> 39:34.230
give them something else
to think about.

39:34.355 --> 39:36.107
I'll drop those pineapples...

39:36.191 --> 39:41.154
like a crazed pigeon hovering
over a mounted statue.

39:42.864 --> 39:45.116
Okay. Let's go.

39:53.708 --> 39:56.586
Everything's cool down there.
House is quiet.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.862
Okay, let's go.

40:41.506 --> 40:42.715
So we finally meet.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.052
I have waited for this moment
for 15 years.

40:46.636 --> 40:48.763
I have savored the thought
of meeting you.

40:48.846 --> 40:52.433
I hate to appear rude, but
who the hell are you, sport?

40:52.558 --> 40:55.019
My daughter was Lin Chow.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.354
Wait a minute.

40:57.397 --> 41:00.692
Her father was General Chow...

41:00.775 --> 41:02.902
the Butcher of Mekong.

41:03.027 --> 41:06.281
I go by the name
of Byron Fung now.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.157
You have dishonored my daughter.

41:08.324 --> 41:10.702
And I have a responsibility
of honor...

41:10.910 --> 41:12.745
to punish you
for your transgression.

41:12.912 --> 41:15.081
I never did anything to your daughter.
She was a friend of mine.

41:15.164 --> 41:17.083
I would never take
advantage of that.

41:18.042 --> 41:20.878
Besides, even if I did,
which I didn't...

41:21.004 --> 41:22.755
you know, but even if I did...

41:22.880 --> 41:26.217
I'm sure that even you must
know that love is a gift...

41:26.342 --> 41:28.553
it's freely given
and freely accepted...

41:28.636 --> 41:32.265
and a true gift can't be
forced on anyone.

41:33.141 --> 41:35.476
Further, I think
I should point out...

41:35.601 --> 41:38.604
that this sort of old world
behavior of yours...

41:38.688 --> 41:41.107
you know, it's very unhip...

41:43.026 --> 41:44.527
Oh, boy.

42:45.463 --> 42:47.048
Murdock, what about the grenade?

42:47.173 --> 42:49.425
I didn't pull
the pin, sweet cheeks.

42:49.509 --> 42:52.804
Murdock, listen, I never
touched his daughter. Really.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.807
Put it in the book, Templeton.

43:21.749 --> 43:23.543
Let's go, Murdock.

43:55.992 --> 43:58.244
<i>In testimony from E.G.
Fowler...</i>

43:58.369 --> 44:02.498
<i>formerly an operations officer attached
to a renegade unit known as The Shop...</i>

44:02.623 --> 44:05.418
<i>David Vaughn has been charged with
crimes against the government...</i>

44:05.501 --> 44:07.003
<i>and attempted murder.</i>

44:07.128 --> 44:09.547
<i>Sources in the CIA
state that David Vaughn...</i>

44:09.630 --> 44:11.966
<i>was not operating
with Agency authority...</i>

44:12.049 --> 44:14.927
<i>and had taken on the operation
without sanction.</i>

44:15.178 --> 44:17.930
<i>Which leads us to the last
chapter of this story...</i>

44:18.055 --> 44:19.932
<i>what of Templeton Peck?</i>

44:20.099 --> 44:22.518
<i>It appears that his pardon
was not signed...</i>

44:22.643 --> 44:24.645
<i>by the correct agency
in Washington...</i>

44:24.812 --> 44:27.648
<i>and that he was being used
as a tool by Vaughn...</i>

44:27.732 --> 44:29.317
<i>to capture General Chow...</i>

44:29.400 --> 44:32.987
<i>known in Vietnam as The Red
Death or The Red Butcher.</i>

44:33.154 --> 44:35.781
<i>Templeton Peck has disappeared
into the underground...</i>

44:35.907 --> 44:38.117
<i>where he has been
forced to live for so long.</i>

44:38.242 --> 44:39.744
Well, there goes Face's pardon.

44:40.036 --> 44:42.580
I never missed Face so much
up until now.

44:42.747 --> 44:44.749
Having to put up
with that fool Murdock...

44:44.850 --> 44:46.507
going around insulting women...

44:46.556 --> 44:49.754
saying he's sexy. He's
driving me crazy, Hannibal.

44:50.963 --> 44:52.798
Oh, Hannibal,
did you see the news?

44:52.924 --> 44:54.175
My pardon went poof!

44:54.258 --> 44:57.220
I'm so sorry, Face. I don't
know how to make it up to you.

44:57.428 --> 44:58.679
But I'd like to try.

44:58.804 --> 45:01.974
Sweetness, I've got a
program of my own going on.

45:02.099 --> 45:04.602
You don't want to forget about
the man of your dreams, do you?

45:04.769 --> 45:07.855
Uh-oh. That's all
right, Hannibal, I can handle it.

45:07.939 --> 45:10.858
You see, there's more to life
than feeling guilty.

45:10.942 --> 45:13.236
As Old Blue Eyes used to sing...

45:13.444 --> 45:14.820
- ♪ Fly me to the moon ♪♪
- Murdock.

45:14.946 --> 45:17.823
Murdock, please. Back off. I'm in
the midst of closing a deal here.

45:17.990 --> 45:20.159
Back off? Face...

45:20.284 --> 45:23.996
I've developed a whole line
of primo rap unto myself.

45:24.147 --> 45:26.205
I can talk intelligently
about the whales.

45:26.236 --> 45:28.334
I can do the "I'm okay,
you're okay" thing.

45:28.542 --> 45:30.044
I can share my feelings.

45:30.127 --> 45:33.464
I've got the whole line
of patter down.

45:33.589 --> 45:36.342
And with my basket
of social goodies full...

45:36.467 --> 45:39.804
I would like
to ask E.G. out...

45:39.929 --> 45:42.390
for an evening of sushi...

45:42.556 --> 45:44.475
and slow dancing.

45:44.600 --> 45:47.186
Well, you see, that was about
to be my next question.

45:47.270 --> 45:49.480
How about some sushi
and the movies?

45:49.605 --> 45:50.856
- The theater.
- Opera?

45:50.940 --> 45:52.441
The ballet.

45:52.858 --> 45:54.360
I love the ballet.

45:55.528 --> 45:57.947
Look, Murdock,
I want you to stop being me.

45:58.030 --> 45:59.532
No way, José.

45:59.615 --> 46:02.034
Not on your monogrammed tie.

46:02.201 --> 46:04.662
How would you like it
if I took your personality?

46:04.787 --> 46:08.165
How would you like it if I became you?
If I become "Howling Mad" Murdock?

46:08.291 --> 46:09.417
You couldn't.

46:09.583 --> 46:11.502
- I couldn't?
- I'm too complex.

46:11.669 --> 46:12.920
Too layered...

46:13.087 --> 46:15.131
too fruitcake.

46:15.339 --> 46:18.217
Too whiskey, too rye.

46:21.637 --> 46:23.014
Come on, guys...

46:23.097 --> 46:25.394
let me fly you to the moon.

46:26.392 --> 46:27.143
Can't you see?

46:27.268 --> 46:29.854
I'm "Howling Mad" Murdock
who drives you...

46:29.937 --> 46:31.605
wildly insane.

46:31.731 --> 46:34.275
<i>V.A. dispatch, this
is Mobile Three, we're at the motel...</i>

46:34.400 --> 46:36.485
<i>and going in for Murdock now.</i>

46:37.111 --> 46:38.487
<i>Roger.</i>

46:45.286 --> 46:46.704
Let's take him.

46:48.414 --> 46:51.083
No, you got the wrong-- That's Murdock.
Hey, Hannibal, say something.

46:51.167 --> 46:52.668
You've got the wrong guy.

46:52.752 --> 46:54.211
I was just pretending
to be Murdock.

46:54.295 --> 46:56.409
I was assuming his personality.

46:56.434 --> 46:59.073
<i>And quite
convincingly, too, I might add.</i>
