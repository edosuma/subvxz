It's me, Padgett Head to Toe here,

01:14.833 --> 01:17.208

-Yeah, can I help you with something?
-I'm Padgett.

18:43.541 --> 18:46.500
Um, we were in Señora Parker's
Spanish class together?

18:46.583 --> 18:47.958
-Remember?
-Uh, yeah.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.666
-I guess so.
-[chuckles] Hola.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.916
Hi.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.375
Good times.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.375
Wait, um, where you going?

18:58.416 --> 19:01.125
-I thought you were finished.
-Uh, no. Sorry.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.458
I was just wondering, uh…

19:04.333 --> 19:06.041
you're a photographer, right?

19:06.750 --> 19:07.666
Yeah.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.666
So the Cali High car wash is next week--

19:10.750 --> 19:12.583
-No.
-You didn't let me finish.

19:12.666 --> 19:14.375
I'm sorry. Yes, please finish.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.250
-We need someone to take pictures for--
-No.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.750
-But it's a fundraiser.
-For what?

19:19.833 --> 19:22.125
Is it cancer research or homelessness?

19:22.208 --> 19:24.000
-Actually, the prom.
-Okay. [laughs]

19:24.083 --> 19:26.958
[giggles nervously] Is that funny?

19:27.041 --> 19:30.875
No, it's sad, actually,
but, um, good luck with that.

19:31.875 --> 19:32.708
Oh my--

19:32.791 --> 19:36.458
I'm so sorry about him.
He's literally like that with everybody.

19:36.541 --> 19:39.583
-How do you know him?
-He's my brother. Just by blood though.

19:39.666 --> 19:41.833
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not publicize it.

19:41.916 --> 19:43.500
Sorry, I don't think I know--

19:43.583 --> 19:45.583
Oh, um, Brin Kweller, sophomore.

19:45.666 --> 19:48.541
I just have to say,
I think you're amazing.

19:48.625 --> 19:52.083
I mean, it sucks what happened
to you. Jordan is such a dick.

19:52.166 --> 19:53.958
Unless you're getting back
together with him?

19:54.041 --> 19:56.083
-No. It's fine.
-Because in that case…

19:56.166 --> 19:58.166
He is a dick.

19:58.916 --> 20:00.416
Is your brother one too?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.583
[scoffs] Um, no, not a dick,

20:03.666 --> 20:06.791
but he does tend to be a bit misanthropic?

20:07.291 --> 20:08.208
I sensed that.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.458
Uh, so if he doesn't like people,
what does he like?

20:12.541 --> 20:14.166
Oh, huh, let's see.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.916
Photography, allegedly.

20:17.000 --> 20:17.833
Allegedly?

20:18.333 --> 20:20.833
No one ever gets to see
any of his pictures, so…

20:20.916 --> 20:22.583
What about music?

20:23.083 --> 20:25.625
Only weird, old stuff,
no one else listens to,

20:25.708 --> 20:28.625
like the Bad Brains, Bad Religion.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.666
Really just anything
with "bad" in the name.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.708
Wow. Uh, what about movies?

20:32.791 --> 20:33.791
Same thing.

20:33.875 --> 20:37.125
Everything's Kurosawa,
kung fu, or Kubrick.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.375
Oh, my. That is a lot of K's.

20:39.958 --> 20:44.291
So, um, [clicks lips] why are you suddenly
so interested in my brother?

20:44.875 --> 20:48.708
Don't get me wrong, I love him
and all, but that's just 'cause I have to.

20:48.791 --> 20:51.583
Uh, curiosity, I guess?

20:51.666 --> 20:52.666
Horses.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.833
-I'm sorry?
-He loves horses.

20:54.916 --> 20:58.000
He works every day
before school at Will Rogers Park.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.625
So like a cowboy, huh?

20:59.708 --> 21:01.375
No, more like a horse girl.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.458
He kind of cried
when he found out unicorns weren't real.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.916
Cameron. What a weird coincidence.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.250
Uh, well, I'm here every morning, so…

21:13.333 --> 21:15.500
I'm pretty sure
the only weird part is you.

21:15.583 --> 21:16.458
Fair enough.

21:16.541 --> 21:19.083
I was hoping to take
a riding lesson this morning.

21:19.166 --> 21:20.833
And I figured
since you and I are friends--

21:20.916 --> 21:24.083
-Ah, friends?
-In the sense we go to school together.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.666
Kind of a loose definition.
Don't you think?

21:27.333 --> 21:30.166
Uh, look, I have a lot of work
to get done before school--

21:30.250 --> 21:33.041
So let me help!
Then if there's time afterwards,

21:33.125 --> 21:34.791
we can squeeze in a lesson.

21:34.875 --> 21:38.500
-You don't even know what the job is.
-That's okay. I am at your service.

21:39.291 --> 21:42.208
Ugh! There's just so much of it. [gags]

21:42.291 --> 21:44.250
What do horses eat anyway?

21:44.333 --> 21:48.000
[Cameron] Well, that one,
Jimbo over there, he likes Chipotle.

21:48.083 --> 21:49.500
Gilly prefers sushi.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.750
Just horse feed. Hay, grass mostly.

21:53.833 --> 21:57.083
Well, this one must have eaten
an entire soccer field.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.666
Well, you offered to help.

21:59.375 --> 22:02.250
I'm starting to think
you've never shoveled crap before.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.833
Only out of a litter box.

22:04.583 --> 22:06.708
And this dump is bigger than my cat.

22:06.791 --> 22:07.833
[chuckles]

22:07.916 --> 22:10.541
So, you really come here
every day before school?

22:10.625 --> 22:12.541
Yep, ever since I was 14.

22:12.625 --> 22:13.750
[shutter clicking]

22:13.833 --> 22:17.500
Wow, you really want to chronicle
your post-poop clean-up look?

22:17.583 --> 22:20.083
I chronicle everything. That's my job.

22:20.666 --> 22:23.083
So, how about that lesson now?

22:24.791 --> 22:27.000
I guess a deal's a deal.

22:27.916 --> 22:30.750
So, do you have
any previous riding experience?

22:30.833 --> 22:33.083
Just one time at a birthday party
when I was five,

22:33.166 --> 22:35.666
but I think it was a baby horse,

22:35.750 --> 22:38.916
or maybe not baby,
but it was small. [chuckles nervously]

22:39.000 --> 22:40.125
Does that count?

22:40.208 --> 22:44.166
I believe the word
you're looking for is pony and no.

22:44.250 --> 22:48.125
[inhales] Anyway, this is Gilly.
He can be a little temperamental, so I--

22:48.208 --> 22:50.625
-What are you doing?
-I'm letting him smell my hand.

22:50.708 --> 22:54.791
It's like a handshake for horses.
I did my research last night. [chuckles]

22:54.875 --> 22:57.750
-[soft neighing]
-Whoa. Why is he doing that?

22:57.833 --> 22:59.500
Actually means he likes you.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.166
Oh, well, I guess he has good instincts.

23:02.958 --> 23:03.791
Right.

23:03.875 --> 23:06.291
Let's, um, try mounting up.
So come over here.

23:06.791 --> 23:10.041
Put your left foot in the stirrup,
grab the reins with your left hand,

23:10.125 --> 23:12.750
and use your other leg
to haul you up and over.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.041
[Padgett grunts]

23:15.208 --> 23:17.541
-I'm a natural, right?
-Not bad.

23:19.208 --> 23:20.125
[shutter clicking]

23:20.208 --> 23:22.166
[Cameron] Um, seriously?

23:22.250 --> 23:24.833
-More?
-I'm just capturing the moment. [chuckles]

23:24.916 --> 23:27.916
You can't enjoy this without sharing it
with 500 strangers?

23:28.000 --> 23:31.208
Five hundred? Try 887,132.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.625
And they're not strangers.
They're followers.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.666
Followers? You mean like a cult?

23:35.750 --> 23:37.333
No, not like a cult.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.250
Just people devoted to me
and totally guided by my advice

23:40.333 --> 23:42.041
as to how to live their lives.

23:42.125 --> 23:44.625
I'm joking. I was just taking a picture.

23:44.708 --> 23:48.166
-You take pictures. What's the difference?
-Too vast to even explain.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.958
Now, come on off the horse.

23:50.041 --> 23:51.458
-That's it? We're done?
-No.

23:51.541 --> 23:53.500
I just want you
to practice getting on and off.

24:22.708 --> 24:26.041
where the dance team will be performing
their annual dance presentation.

24:26.125 --> 24:29.375
A tradition I still don't understand,
but it's the committee's decision,

24:29.458 --> 24:30.583
and I support them.

24:30.666 --> 24:33.166
…instead of starting in Portugal,
we start in Amsterdam.

24:33.250 --> 24:35.916
Uh, Kweller, can we maybe do this later?
I have a French quiz.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
These are the best fares
I've seen in months.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.916
Just, um, give me your phone.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.958
-What's wrong with yours?
-Really?

24:42.875 --> 24:45.750

is becoming a character flaw.

Hey, guys.

24:47.166 --> 24:49.708
Uh… hey?

for this morning.

Uh, context, please?

24:58.125 --> 25:00.333
-I gave her a riding lesson.
-I bet you did.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.083
Horse riding.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.625
-Mm-hmm.
-Part of one, anyway.

25:03.708 --> 25:07.375
And as a way of saying thanks,
there is a karaoke party this Saturday

25:07.458 --> 25:11.083

and I was hoping you guys could come.

25:11.166 --> 25:13.958
-Uh, yeah. Um, I don't… I don't--
-We'll be there.

25:14.041 --> 25:18.291
Perfect. So Cameron,
should I like, SMS you the address?

25:18.375 --> 25:20.291
Kweller's phone is
an antiquated piece of crap.

25:20.375 --> 25:22.791
-Why don't you send it to me?
-Awesome. Okay.

Oh, I am so sorry.

[Cameron] Yeah, it's four years ago.

37:34.250 --> 37:38.416
She was dating this guy named Marcus,
who flew a turboprop.

37:39.291 --> 37:43.208
And one Saturday morning,
they were on their way back from Laramie,

37:44.708 --> 37:46.250
and, um…

37:46.750 --> 37:48.250
You must miss her a lot.

37:49.416 --> 37:50.875
Yeah, Mom was awesome.

37:52.708 --> 37:55.958
In fact, she is the one
who gave me this camera.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.041
So that's why you love it so much.

37:58.125 --> 38:00.541
Yeah. So what about your family?

38:00.625 --> 38:02.791
Well, my parents are divorced.

38:02.875 --> 38:04.208
-[chuckles]
-Okay.

38:04.291 --> 38:08.416
Um, my dad lives in Florida
with his new family.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.500
And I'm here with my mom.

38:10.583 --> 38:14.125
-Okay, what does she do?
-She's a nurse.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.125
Hmm.

38:15.208 --> 38:16.958
[Padgett]
I've never told anyone that before.

38:17.041 --> 38:20.958
She works her ass off
to give me every opportunity in the world.

38:21.458 --> 38:25.208
And sometimes I'm scared
I won't be able to make it up to her.

-Hey, did I say you could do that?

38:28.416 --> 38:30.333
No. That's the whole idea
of a candid shot.

38:30.416 --> 38:34.166
If you know I'm going to take a photo,
then you gotta fix your hair,

38:34.250 --> 38:36.041
and you do that whole duck-face thing.

38:36.125 --> 38:38.416

38:49.708 --> 38:50.916
Uh, depends.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.666
-Are you free next weekend?
-Why?

38:52.750 --> 38:56.125
It's my friend Alden's birthday,
and she's having a theme party.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.708
Okay, what's the theme?

38:57.791 --> 39:00.208
It's Drop it like F. Scott.
It's a Great Gatsby thing.

39:00.291 --> 39:02.208
Yeah, she does realize
those parties in the book

39:02.291 --> 39:04.416
represent the shallowness
of the ruling class, right?

39:04.500 --> 39:05.791
Sadly, that is the appeal.

39:05.875 --> 39:07.791
-Okay.
-[Padgett] So what do you think?

39:07.875 --> 39:09.833
-You down to get bougie together?
-[Cameron] Yeah.

39:09.916 --> 39:11.375
Can I bring some people?

39:11.458 --> 39:13.541
Sure. Yeah.
Bring whoever you want. [chuckles]

but I have the best brother ever.

39:18.041 --> 39:19.833
He has his moments.

39:19.916 --> 39:21.875
Okay. It's a roaring '20s theme,

39:21.958 --> 39:24.041
so there's a million ways
we can go with this.

39:24.125 --> 39:27.041
Yeah, but we're
only gonna try like, three, right?

39:27.125 --> 39:28.541
[Nisha] Don't listen to him.

39:28.625 --> 39:31.250
He's been wearing
the same three plaids since 2017?

At least I alternate.

39:32.833 --> 39:33.875

57:21.125 --> 57:23.333
-Q! That's amazing.
-[Quinn chuckles]

57:23.416 --> 57:25.458
I thought I saw
you guys talking at the party.

57:25.541 --> 57:27.000
Yeah, she's pretty great.

57:27.083 --> 57:29.291
I was thinking about asking her to prom.

57:29.375 --> 57:33.333
No way. Oh my God, that's so great.
You guys would be so cute together.

57:33.416 --> 57:35.875
-So how are you gonna ask her?
-Hey, um…

57:36.958 --> 57:37.958
You got a sec?

57:38.875 --> 57:40.500
Go. I'll talk to you later.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.791
I didn't think
you were talking to me anymore.

57:44.875 --> 57:46.583
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

57:46.666 --> 57:49.291
I got really pissed off,
but you didn't do anything.

57:49.375 --> 57:51.541
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

57:51.625 --> 57:53.791
Hey! You, my man, are a rock star.

57:53.875 --> 57:56.375
Inspiration. Do you want to hear a poem?

57:57.083 --> 57:57.916
Sure.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.250
Um, Cameron Kweller

58:00.750 --> 58:01.708
Interstellar

58:01.791 --> 58:03.041
Stood up to the dick

58:03.833 --> 58:04.791
Made it stick

58:05.541 --> 58:06.791
Cameron, one

58:06.875 --> 58:08.041
Jordan, zero

58:08.125 --> 58:10.250
King Cameron, you're my hero

58:10.333 --> 58:11.500
Fight the power, man.

58:12.083 --> 58:13.375
That was great.

58:13.458 --> 58:15.458
-[crunches]
-[painfully] Ah, worth it.

58:15.958 --> 58:18.208
-Okay. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

58:18.291 --> 58:20.291
Can you believe all this prom BS?

58:20.375 --> 58:23.666
I know. Pretty cool, right?
I mean, what do you think?

58:23.750 --> 58:27.041
Well, that's actually
what I wanted to talk to you about.

58:27.125 --> 58:28.041
[bell rings]

58:28.125 --> 58:30.125
Uh, but now I'm late for Art History.

58:30.208 --> 58:34.083
Um, is there any chance
you could come over after school?

58:34.166 --> 58:37.333
-There's something I wanted to show you.
-Um, sure.

58:37.416 --> 58:38.541
-I'll be there.
-Cool.

58:39.041 --> 58:40.041
Bye.

58:43.083 --> 58:45.375
-[door closes]
-So this whole prom king thing,

58:46.041 --> 58:48.041
I can't believe you're actually into it.

58:48.125 --> 58:51.708
Well, I'm not really,
but I do hate Van Draanen.

58:51.791 --> 58:55.208
Guys like him crap all over everyone
and somehow still end up on top.

58:55.291 --> 58:57.750
Not this time.
Not if I have anything to do with it.

58:57.833 --> 59:00.333
-That sounded confident.
-'Cause I am.

59:00.416 --> 59:03.250
And after Alden's party,
you have some serious traction.

59:03.750 --> 59:06.750
But you're gonna have to let
people see the real Cam Kweller.

59:06.833 --> 59:10.125
Well, speaking of the real me,
right this way.

59:16.583 --> 59:19.708
Wow. I cannot believe
you have your own darkroom.

59:20.208 --> 59:21.041
Yeah.

59:21.125 --> 59:23.333
It was my 14th birthday present.

59:23.833 --> 59:26.583
So you've been taking pictures
your whole life then?

59:26.666 --> 59:29.625
[Cameron] Kind of.
Used to be more of a hobby,

59:29.708 --> 59:31.666
but now I don't know.

59:31.750 --> 59:35.458
Sometimes I feel like
I could spend my entire life in this room.

59:36.083 --> 59:38.875
Cameron, these are amazing.

59:39.541 --> 59:42.416
So why are you letting me see them now?

59:42.916 --> 59:44.750
Well, you wouldn't stop asking,

59:45.333 --> 59:48.250
so I figured this was
the only way to get you to stop.

59:48.333 --> 59:51.708
Well, you are very talented.

59:51.791 --> 59:53.208
I mean, look at this one. Oh!

59:54.208 --> 59:55.583
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

59:55.666 --> 59:56.500
It's, uh…

59:57.458 --> 59:58.625
It's okay.

59:59.208 --> 1:00:00.041
Really.

1:00:00.708 --> 1:00:03.291
You know, you could
totally make money at this, right?

1:00:03.375 --> 1:00:04.958
You know I don't care about money.

1:00:05.041 --> 1:00:08.458
Or not,
but keeping your talent locked away.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:10.041
What are you hiding from?

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.166
You know,
I could ask you the same question.

1:00:13.250 --> 1:00:14.625
What are you talking about?

1:00:14.708 --> 1:00:18.500
Well, I'm talking about this.

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:23.666
And, uh… this.

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:26.958
And these.

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:30.791
Not the eyelashes,
they're glued on pretty tight.

1:00:33.875 --> 1:00:35.708
♪ I love to love ♪

1:00:35.791 --> 1:00:37.458
♪ I love all the ways ♪

1:00:37.541 --> 1:00:39.000
♪ I feel so much ♪

1:00:39.083 --> 1:00:40.666

1:00:40.750 --> 1:00:42.500

1:00:42.583 --> 1:00:44.458
♪ I just wanna stay ♪

1:00:44.541 --> 1:00:47.916
Listen, Cameron,
there's something I need to tell you.

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.208
-And I need to tell you something too.
-Okay?

1:00:51.166 --> 1:00:55.041
Well, you asked me why I invited you here,

1:00:55.708 --> 1:00:58.208
and I don't even let
my own grandmother in here.

1:00:58.291 --> 1:00:59.458
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:00:59.541 --> 1:01:02.416
Which is why she probably thinks
I'm running a meth lab.

1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:03.583
[both laughing]

1:01:03.666 --> 1:01:05.541
So then why am I here?

1:01:06.125 --> 1:01:07.583
Because I trust you.

1:01:10.166 --> 1:01:11.333
[Padgett] Oh, okay.

1:01:11.416 --> 1:01:13.708
-Well, I--
-[Cameron] Are you okay?

1:01:14.458 --> 1:01:16.666
Totally, I just… I need to go.

1:01:17.166 --> 1:01:20.250
-Besides, I've wasted enough of your time.
-I wouldn't put it that way.

1:01:20.333 --> 1:01:23.583
No, that's not what I meant.
I just… I have somewhere to be.

1:01:23.666 --> 1:01:25.916
-Um… Call you later?
-[Cameron] Yeah.

1:01:26.666 --> 1:01:27.500
Sure.

1:01:35.541 --> 1:01:36.791
Hey, you got a sec?

1:01:37.375 --> 1:01:38.958
Uh, yeah. Why?

1:01:39.041 --> 1:01:42.083
I just kind of wanted
your advice on something.

1:01:42.666 --> 1:01:44.875
If it isn't the fountain of truth

1:01:44.958 --> 1:01:48.083
coming to get help
figuring out the world of bullshit.

1:01:48.166 --> 1:01:49.000
Yeah, funny.

1:01:49.875 --> 1:01:51.375
Here's the deal. Uh…

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:55.750
Things with Padgett may have gotten
a little more complicated than I thought.

1:01:55.833 --> 1:01:59.333
Okay. Complicated good or complicated bad?

1:01:59.875 --> 1:02:04.250
'Cause the other night at that party,
I was definitely sensing chemistry.

1:02:04.333 --> 1:02:05.625
Oh, wait.

1:02:05.708 --> 1:02:06.833
Did you guys hook up?

1:02:06.916 --> 1:02:08.750
Oh my God, you did!

1:02:08.833 --> 1:02:12.000
No, no, no. We didn't hook up, we…

1:02:12.791 --> 1:02:14.000
we kissed.

1:02:14.083 --> 1:02:18.250
[shrieks] I knew it! Oh my God.
This is huge. So did you ask her to prom?

1:02:18.333 --> 1:02:21.208
It makes sense if you go together.
And if you're king and queen?

1:02:21.291 --> 1:02:22.500
How amazing would that be?

1:02:22.583 --> 1:02:24.791
It would be like
Cali's own royal love story.

1:02:24.875 --> 1:02:27.291
-[chuckles] And you're the princess.
-Whoa, whoa.

1:02:27.375 --> 1:02:29.166
Yes. I thought about asking her,

1:02:29.250 --> 1:02:33.333
but after we kissed,
things just kind of got weird.

1:02:33.416 --> 1:02:34.958
Of course they did. It's fine.

1:02:35.041 --> 1:02:36.541
First kisses can be awkward.

1:02:36.625 --> 1:02:39.000
First time having sex,
that can be even weirder.

1:02:39.083 --> 1:02:40.833
So is the last time

1:02:40.916 --> 1:02:43.791
'cause you never know
if it's gonna be your last.

1:02:44.541 --> 1:02:45.625
Oh…

1:02:45.708 --> 1:02:47.791
Wait, you've never had sex.

1:02:47.875 --> 1:02:50.000
Yeah, but I know things, though.
Like this.

1:02:50.083 --> 1:02:52.500
If you're worried about
whether you should ask Padgett or not,

1:02:52.583 --> 1:02:53.958
just ask yourself one question.

1:02:54.041 --> 1:02:55.208
Okay, what's that?

1:02:55.291 --> 1:02:56.750
Who kissed who first?

1:02:57.583 --> 1:02:59.375
Actually, she kissed me first.

1:03:00.125 --> 1:03:02.375
So I should ask her to prom, then.

1:03:02.458 --> 1:03:05.208
Um, yeah, but you can't just ask, okay?

1:03:05.291 --> 1:03:07.458
It's lame. You have to prompose.

1:03:08.791 --> 1:03:10.166
What the hell is that?

1:03:10.250 --> 1:03:11.833
[upbeat music playing]

1:03:12.625 --> 1:03:13.625
[laughing]

1:03:14.833 --> 1:03:16.041
[girl screams]

1:03:16.125 --> 1:03:18.125
[speaking indistinctly]

1:03:22.958 --> 1:03:24.666
-[Quinn] Hey.
-Hey.

1:03:24.750 --> 1:03:26.083
[Quinn] No word from Cameron?

1:03:26.166 --> 1:03:30.208
No, he must think I'm such a freak.
I practically sprinted out of there.

1:03:30.291 --> 1:03:33.041
He had the nomination.
Why'd screw it up by kissing him?

1:03:33.125 --> 1:03:34.958
-[Quinn] I do have one theory.
-Yeah?

1:03:35.458 --> 1:03:38.541
You really like him, Padge,
and when you like someone

1:03:38.625 --> 1:03:40.791
the other stuff
just doesn't matter as much.

1:03:40.875 --> 1:03:42.041
I do.

1:03:42.125 --> 1:03:43.416
I do like him.

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:44.333
Yeah.

1:03:45.083 --> 1:03:48.541
Something tells me you might not
have screwed up as much as you think.

1:03:49.125 --> 1:03:51.208
-What do you mean?
-[boy] Hey, look, look!

1:03:52.166 --> 1:03:54.208
Oh my God, Cameron.

1:03:54.291 --> 1:03:57.291
I know this isn't
usually my style, obviously,

1:03:57.375 --> 1:04:00.541
but, uh… what do you think?

1:04:00.625 --> 1:04:02.458
-I think yes.
-[Alden] Sorry.

1:04:02.541 --> 1:04:06.791
I hate to interrupt this adorable moment,
but don't you think there's something

1:04:06.875 --> 1:04:08.291
you should tell Cameron first?

1:04:08.375 --> 1:04:10.375
-What are you doing?
-[Quinn] Leave her alone, Alden.

1:04:10.458 --> 1:04:12.708
-[Alden] Shut up, Quinn.
-What's going on?

1:04:13.291 --> 1:04:15.375
Padgett, do you want
to tell him, or should I?

1:04:16.083 --> 1:04:19.125
-What's she talking about?
-What I was trying to tell you yesterday.

1:04:19.208 --> 1:04:20.708
It's… It's actually funny.

1:04:20.791 --> 1:04:22.583
After Jordan and I broke up,

1:04:22.666 --> 1:04:25.375
I lost my sponsorships, my college money,

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:27.125
so I panicked.

1:04:27.208 --> 1:04:30.250
-Yeah, she's not lying. Total meltdown.
-Yeah, thanks to you, Alden.

1:04:30.333 --> 1:04:32.916
So I made a bet with Alden

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.458
that I could take some person
and… and… and make them over.

1:04:36.541 --> 1:04:38.916
Some person. What kind of person?

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.458
-Can we talk about this in private?
-No, what kind of person, Padgett?

1:04:42.541 --> 1:04:45.166
The biggest loser
so she could turn him into prom king.

1:04:45.250 --> 1:04:47.583
-But that was before--
-Wait. So I was a bet?

1:04:47.666 --> 1:04:50.333
-[Padgett] No--
-No, I was a fucking bet.

1:04:55.041 --> 1:04:56.208
You can all go to hell.

1:04:57.166 --> 1:04:58.000
Let's go.

1:04:58.750 --> 1:04:59.583
[Padgett sighs]

1:05:00.083 --> 1:05:02.541
Yikes, that was hard to watch.

1:05:09.583 --> 1:05:12.583
Hey, it's Cameron.
Leave a message, or don't.

1:05:13.208 --> 1:05:16.875
Cameron, it's me again.

1:05:17.875 --> 1:05:22.250
I know I covered this
in the 800 texts you haven't returned,

1:05:22.333 --> 1:05:25.458
but I'm so sorry,

1:05:25.541 --> 1:05:27.958
and I just want to make sure you're okay.

1:05:29.125 --> 1:05:30.666
He's still not answering?

1:05:30.750 --> 1:05:33.166
[Padgett] No, but can you blame him?

1:05:33.250 --> 1:05:37.000
No, but right now,
I'm a little bit more worried about you.

1:05:37.625 --> 1:05:39.458
You and your god-awful ironing.

1:05:39.541 --> 1:05:41.041
Please let me do that. Please.

1:05:41.875 --> 1:05:45.583
You know,
I convinced myself that I did my posts

1:05:45.666 --> 1:05:49.833
because I cared about my followers,
but maybe I was just doing it for myself

1:05:49.916 --> 1:05:52.458
to get money and get popular.

1:05:53.041 --> 1:05:54.916
Maybe I'm just a fraud.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.625
Honey, I happen to know
for a fact that you're not a fake.

1:05:57.708 --> 1:05:59.916
You're a truly kind and caring person.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.375
But I hurt someone, Mom.
I mean, I really hurt him.

1:06:03.458 --> 1:06:04.416
All right, yeah.

1:06:04.916 --> 1:06:07.958
You screwed up, but it's only a mistake
if you don't learn from it.

1:06:08.750 --> 1:06:10.875
I just don't even know what to do anymore.

1:06:10.958 --> 1:06:14.208
If I win tomorrow night, I'll have to go
in front of all these people--

1:06:14.291 --> 1:06:15.833
And be yourself.

1:06:15.916 --> 1:06:19.875
But… what if I don't even like
who that is anymore?

1:06:20.708 --> 1:06:23.708
Listen, I know
it feels like that right now.

1:06:23.791 --> 1:06:26.416
I do. But the Padgett Sawyer that I know,

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.875
the kind, sweet, generous,

1:06:29.958 --> 1:06:33.583
sure, stubborn girl
that I've known for 18 years,

1:06:33.666 --> 1:06:36.583
well, she gets lost now and again.

1:06:36.666 --> 1:06:40.708
We all do,
but she always finds her way back.

1:06:42.958 --> 1:06:43.875
[sighs]

1:06:44.791 --> 1:06:46.125
[crickets chirping]

1:06:48.083 --> 1:06:49.250
Oh, Gilly.

1:06:49.875 --> 1:06:52.541
I thought you were
a good judge of character. [sniffs]

1:06:53.125 --> 1:06:54.083
[snorts]

1:06:56.666 --> 1:06:57.833
[Mom sighs]

1:06:57.916 --> 1:06:59.000
All right.

1:06:59.750 --> 1:07:01.166
-How do I look?
-Gorge.

1:07:01.250 --> 1:07:03.041
You're gonna be the queen
of the chaperones.

1:07:03.125 --> 1:07:04.000
[car honks]

1:07:04.083 --> 1:07:06.875
Thank you. It looks like my car is here.
All right, put your dress on.

1:07:06.958 --> 1:07:08.166
I'll see you there.

1:07:08.250 --> 1:07:09.083
Okay.

1:07:09.166 --> 1:07:10.750
[phone rings]

1:07:10.833 --> 1:07:11.750

1:07:12.250 --> 1:07:13.166
[sniffs]

1:07:14.041 --> 1:07:16.333
-You're really gonna go through with this?
-I mean…

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:18.833
I know I'm not gonna get what I want,

1:07:18.916 --> 1:07:21.958
so at least this way, I have a chance
to make things right with Cameron.

1:07:22.083 --> 1:07:24.125
-Ha! Wanna bet?
-Too soon.

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:27.708
Nisha, I know you don't trust me.

1:07:27.791 --> 1:07:30.166
I mean, he's your best friend,

1:07:30.250 --> 1:07:34.666
but I think I've really fallen for him,
so I have to try.

1:07:34.750 --> 1:07:38.458
You have one big problem.
There's no way that dude is going to prom.

1:07:39.166 --> 1:07:40.125
Yeah.

1:07:40.208 --> 1:07:43.208
So I guess that means
there's only one person left to ask.

1:07:43.291 --> 1:07:44.583
[phone rings]

1:07:52.125 --> 1:07:53.750
Screw off, Bubble Girl.

1:07:53.833 --> 1:07:56.250
Okay, a little harsh,

1:07:56.333 --> 1:07:58.041
but I have to ask.

1:07:58.125 --> 1:07:59.208
Is he okay?

1:07:59.291 --> 1:08:01.125
I don't know. He's at work.

1:08:01.208 --> 1:08:04.291
Why do you keep calling me?
Aren't you supposed to be at prom?

1:08:04.375 --> 1:08:06.166
Yeah, like half an hour ago.

1:08:06.250 --> 1:08:08.250
But I have
a really important favor to ask.

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:10.458
Tell me why in the hell I should help you.

1:08:10.541 --> 1:08:14.958
I can't, and I know you two
have lost so much more than me,

1:08:15.458 --> 1:08:18.333
but I've lost a lot recently.

1:08:19.291 --> 1:08:21.416
I lost my self-respect.

1:08:22.250 --> 1:08:23.750
I lost my college fund.

1:08:24.458 --> 1:08:25.750
I lost my friends,

1:08:27.666 --> 1:08:31.083
but the only thing
I truly care about losing…

1:08:32.541 --> 1:08:33.416
is your brother.

1:08:36.583 --> 1:08:37.833
[Bosch] Tonight's the big night.

1:08:37.916 --> 1:08:41.416
Turns out this year's dance presentation
is now gonna be a dance competition.

1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:44.375
I don't know what that means,
but it's the committee's decision,

1:08:44.458 --> 1:08:45.333
and I support them.

1:08:48.166 --> 1:08:49.083
[car door closes]

1:08:49.166 --> 1:08:50.000
Hey.

1:08:52.041 --> 1:08:52.958
What's in the bag?

1:08:53.041 --> 1:08:56.666
Formal wear, or the closest thing
I could find to it in your closet.

1:08:57.458 --> 1:08:59.375
Dude, it's a disaster in there.

1:08:59.458 --> 1:09:01.416
Why are there
so many Skittles on the floor?

1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:05.000
Because I spilled some Skittles.
Look, if that's for prom, I--

1:09:05.083 --> 1:09:08.625
Look, I know what you're gonna say,
okay, and… I get it.

1:09:08.708 --> 1:09:10.250
Padgett screwed up.

1:09:10.333 --> 1:09:13.083
What she did was mean
and selfish and wrong.

1:09:13.166 --> 1:09:15.291
Yes, exactly. So why are you here?

1:09:16.416 --> 1:09:17.541
Because, Cam…

1:09:19.375 --> 1:09:21.125
I've… I've missed you.

1:09:21.708 --> 1:09:22.875
Brin, I'm right here.

1:09:22.958 --> 1:09:24.250
No, no. I mean, like…

1:09:25.291 --> 1:09:27.666
I miss the way you used to be,
you know? Before…

1:09:28.458 --> 1:09:29.291
Before Mom.

1:09:30.416 --> 1:09:33.625
[sniffs] Ever since
you've been with Padgett, okay,

1:09:34.750 --> 1:09:38.000
you've been back, and you've been
smiling again, and you've been happy.

1:09:38.083 --> 1:09:41.958
And I just feel like… [sniffs]
…for the first time since we moved here

1:09:42.625 --> 1:09:44.708
that I have my brother back.

1:09:44.791 --> 1:09:46.416
And don't lose her, Cam.

1:09:47.375 --> 1:09:50.500
We lost mom, and there's nothing
we could have done about that,

1:09:50.583 --> 1:09:53.916
but now you have a choice,
so just… just don't lose her, okay?

1:10:01.125 --> 1:10:02.500

1:10:05.833 --> 1:10:06.833
[shutter clicking]

1:10:08.791 --> 1:10:11.833
There you are, thank God.
We need you to start the dance.

1:10:11.916 --> 1:10:13.833
-Big night, huh?
-What do you want, Alden?

1:10:13.916 --> 1:10:17.041
Nothing, I just noticed
you didn't bring Cameron.

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:19.083
-So--
-He's not coming. Okay?

1:10:19.750 --> 1:10:20.875
You win the bet.

1:10:20.958 --> 1:10:23.458
And when are you gonna become
a permanent loser?

1:10:23.541 --> 1:10:25.666
I'll get it done as soon as I can. Happy?

1:10:25.750 --> 1:10:27.666
I'll be happy when I get my crown.

1:10:27.750 --> 1:10:31.458
And, oh, hope you like the new
choreography me and Jordan came up with.

1:10:31.541 --> 1:10:32.708
[Bosch] Cali High Earthquakes,

1:10:32.791 --> 1:10:35.208
it's time to report to the stage
for your annual dance…

1:10:35.291 --> 1:10:37.625
-Come on. This is it. Let's go.
-[Alden] Jordan, it's time.

1:10:37.708 --> 1:10:39.791
Come on, guys.
If you put your TikToks down,

1:10:39.875 --> 1:10:42.250
you'll see some people dancing
in real life.

1:10:42.333 --> 1:10:43.583
It's gonna be great.

1:10:43.666 --> 1:10:47.041

on your phone, and then go on this app
