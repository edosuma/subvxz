WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:03.586
I need to be assured that this means
that 51 is safe.

00:03.712 --> 00:04.671
Yes, it does.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.381
Previously on "Chicago Fire..."

00:06.507 --> 00:09.884
- I didn't campaign for your job, Wally.
- I'm giving up my job to save 51.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.261
I'm Benny's wife. The boys miss him.

00:12.388 --> 00:15.723
He hasn't been home in months.
They need to see their father.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.350
I saw your name on the applicant list.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.810
I was in a bad place, man.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.269
You'd make a hell of a cop, though.

00:20.396 --> 00:21.729
My wife moved out back in August.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.148
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- What are you gonna do?

00:24.274 --> 00:25.566
This is torture.

00:25.693 --> 00:29.362
The boys talk about you all the time.
They miss you.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.572
I think I know
what you're going through.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.243
You can twist yourself up in knots
trying to understand it,

00:35.369 --> 00:37.453
but ultimately I don't think
it's for us to figure out.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.914
There's a protein in our blood
called osteopontin.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.834
- Your levels are higher than expected.
- Meaning what?

00:42.960 --> 00:45.628
Sometimes it's an indicator
for asbestos poisoning.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.105
The scans will be read by a radiologist

01:04.231 --> 01:06.315
and they'll get back to you
with the results.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.151
I thought the results were instant.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.611
Let's see, you're being screened
for lung cancer?

01:10.738 --> 01:13.072
I'm sure someone will let you know
by tomorrow.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.826
Here, give it here!

01:16.952 --> 01:18.619
- Go long. Go deep.
- Go long!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.542
Touchdown!

01:27.087 --> 01:28.921
Broken glass. Flag on play.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.257
Hey! No way, that was a touchdown.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.967
Of course it was.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.179
- Hey!
- Should I come back later?

01:36.305 --> 01:38.347
Nope, we were just, uh, cleaning.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.225
- Yeah, just dusting.
- Why do you need a football to clean?

01:41.351 --> 01:42.935
Ooh, busted.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.480
Hey, my house.
I decide who's busted, all right?

01:45.606 --> 01:46.773
Oop!

01:46.899 --> 01:48.941
Oh, Ben. I'm sorry, wait.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.152
Hold on. Give me a look.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.156
Maybe it's time G.I. Joe
goes into retirement.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.909
- No!
- Wait, wait. OK, OK. Um...

01:58.035 --> 02:00.495
Listen, Gabby sees this
kind of thing every day.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.706
If you guys can do the dishes, then
she'll get him back into fighting shape.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.874
What do you say?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.084
OK?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.059
- Hey, excuse me.
- Yeah?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.311
Weren't you here before
with Benny Severide?

02:25.437 --> 02:27.104
Uh, yeah, I was. Why?

02:27.231 --> 02:30.066
I just wanted to know if you were aware
that he has a wife and kids.

02:30.192 --> 02:33.069
Yeah, of course I do. I... Who are you?

02:33.904 --> 02:36.239
So it doesn't bother you,
breaking up a family?

02:36.365 --> 02:37.907
Do you think I'm dating Benny?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.077
To be generous, yeah.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.663
I'm his daughter, Katie.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.589
You three make quite a crew.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.091
Yeah.

02:55.968 --> 03:00.054
Which reminds me, cabin on Lake Carroll.

03:01.056 --> 03:04.058
Two days pulling largemouth
out of crystal clear water.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.978
Oh, man, they're gonna love that.
And so will you.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.813
Yes, I will.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.111
- Hey.
- Matt?

03:15.237 --> 03:17.029
I have some news.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.241
Boys, I'm coming home.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.869
- What, really?
- Mom's coming home!

03:22.995 --> 03:26.289
Because of overcrowding,
they're letting me out early.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.207
I told you she'd come back!

03:28.333 --> 03:29.500
Mom's coming home!

03:31.879 --> 03:33.754
Mom's coming home!

03:33.881 --> 03:37.884
Mom's coming home!
I told you she'd come back.

03:38.010 --> 03:41.095
Whoo-hoo! Mom's coming home!

03:48.937 --> 03:51.147
Your wife, Beth, came to see me.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.233
She's got a flair for the dramatic,
that woman.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.944
Now you understand why
it's best I give her some space.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.071
Always the martyr.

03:59.197 --> 04:02.116
- You don't know the whole story.
- And I never do.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.994
Like I didn't know the story
of my 21-year-old sister.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.373
Yeah, I talked to her.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.833
21 years old,

04:10.959 --> 04:14.378
which is exactly how long ago you left
me and Mom to fend for ourselves.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.882
Tell me this, do you even know
who her mom is?

04:18.008 --> 04:19.133
Of course I do.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.260
And have you been taking care of her
all these years?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.304
How could I?
I just met Katie when I got to town.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.557
You're unbelievable.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.352
Yeah, well, alert the press,
I had some issues when I was young.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.563
But don't forget, I'm coming
out of a happy retirement

04:32.689 --> 04:34.398
to save your dysfunctional firehouse.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.359
That's an excuse!

04:36.485 --> 04:39.862
You're just running from another family,
leaving the kids with the bill.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.883
Hey, Herrmann,
Lieutenant tests are coming up.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.427
- How many times you take that thing?
- Capp, really?

05:03.553 --> 05:05.972
Ha-ha. You mean
how many times did I fail it?

05:08.934 --> 05:11.227
The answer is three,
but not since the '90s.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.646
Five kids is all the
aggravation that I need.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.940
I know my place.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.192
Hey, lady in the house.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.111
- Hey.
- Mama!

05:20.237 --> 05:22.655
Ah, now here's a sight I love to see.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.950
What? Me or the groceries?

05:26.076 --> 05:27.535
There's more in the car.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.286
- I got it.
- Hey, guys.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.539
- Good to see you.
- Hey, baby, how are you?

05:32.624 --> 05:34.709
Wallace. Hi.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.796
I will help
with the rest of the groceries.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.590
Uh, Chief? You have a call.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.397
I'm no foodie, but two Millses in the
kitchen bodes well for lunch, huh?

05:56.523 --> 05:57.940
Hmm.

05:59.568 --> 06:03.529
I thought McLeod burned all
of our old log books in the town square.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.990
- What year you got there?
- '85.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.245
I don't suppose you're
just cruising memory lane.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.249
Factory fire on Haskell.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.626
High heat.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.004
Asbestos falling like snow.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.757
No masks back then.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.057
Three of these men are dead.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.144
Lung cancer.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.370
Hey, Severide, roll call's
in five minutes. Where's Shay?

06:53.497 --> 06:56.373
I don't know, Dawson.
I'm not her babysitter.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.666
Someone needs to be.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.710
Looks like the engine is losing water.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.378
Couple of seals are cracked.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.422
We put in a request,

07:03.548 --> 07:06.050
and the Wizard said
it's going to be a couple of weeks.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.843
You sure we've got that long?

07:07.969 --> 07:09.220
Excuse me?

07:10.972 --> 07:12.389
I'm looking for Jeff Clarke.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.016
Yeah, who should I say is...

07:14.142 --> 07:15.559
His wife.

07:17.813 --> 07:18.979
Yeah.

07:24.736 --> 07:25.861
Something wrong?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.823
Just slow down for a second.
I'm here in peace.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.076
- What do you want, Lisa?
- To talk to you.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.537
I've been going to a group.

07:35.747 --> 07:36.872
Good for you.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.583
It's a place to hear
other people's stories.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.253
To connect and find out
what's going on in your head.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.922
Here's what's going
on inside my head.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.926
A month after I got back, you were
sleeping at your sister's house.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.721
When I needed you most, you left.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.808
Jeff, you treated me
like the day's garbage. Worse.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.269
Is that what they
tell you in that group?

08:00.397 --> 08:03.482
- You left me, Lisa.
- I did.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.943
And I'm sorry.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.280
OK? I'm here to say I'm sorry.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.867
- I wish it was that easy.
- It could be if you let it.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.035
Let's just spend some time together.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.913
I've got to get back.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.837
OK. See you later.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.304
Hey.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.723
Look, before you start
with the heavy breathing, I know.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.474
I'm more than happy to get a reliever.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.895
I'm good, I'm good.
I just got a lot going on.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.148
Yeah, I see you got your hands full.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.289
Hey.

09:01.791 --> 09:05.169
Our house has been
under the microscope lately.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.256
Everyone in this room
has handled the various intrusions

09:09.382 --> 09:11.717
like the professionals
I know you to be.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.470
And that is why 51
is still going strong.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.935
It's your commitment to the house

09:21.061 --> 09:23.854
that allows me in good conscience
to announce

09:23.980 --> 09:26.232
my retirement from the CFD.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.871
It's been an honor to serve
with every single one of you.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.212
Chief...

09:55.971 --> 09:57.346
Let's go to work.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.516
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61,

10:00.642 --> 10:05.271
Battalion 25, railroad incident,
South Homan and 75th.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.285
Did you know?

10:20.537 --> 10:22.162
McLeod's been pressuring him.

10:23.081 --> 10:26.166
We just got to get this call over with
and talk him out of it.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.668
This'll be quick.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.962
Five bucks says
just another sofa on the tracks.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.714
50 says it's not.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.967
What the hell?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.304
Chief, I'm seeing
multiple commuter cars derailed,

10:38.430 --> 10:41.015
at least 100 fleeing passengers,
and several fires,

10:41.141 --> 10:43.392
including cars and a building.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.020
Did that train go
into that building?

10:46.146 --> 10:49.106
We're going to need more alarms, Chief.

10:51.276 --> 10:54.278
25 to Main, we've got
multiple commuter cars derailed,

10:54.404 --> 10:56.030
and at least 100 victims.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.283
I need a 2-11 Alarm and an EMS Plan 2
to the rail corridor on 75th.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.660
Chief, we'll take the passenger car.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.455
Recon the tanker
and get a handle on the car fires.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.998
- Copy that.
- Shay, Dawson.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.082
Here, Chief.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.419
- Set up triage. Call it as you see it.
- You got it.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.379
- That thing plowed right into us!
- Come with me.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.964
There's more guys in the warehouse.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.508
Check the cars for victims.
We got more in the warehouse.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.177
Otis, grab the pike!

11:21.973 --> 11:24.141
Liquid propane!
Liquid propane, Chief!

11:26.394 --> 11:27.603
All companies be aware

11:27.729 --> 11:30.356
that the overturned tanker is filled
with propane.

11:30.482 --> 11:33.317
Work quickly. Let's get those people
out of those train cars.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.277
Help! Please!

11:38.698 --> 11:40.574
Let's go! Get that plug open!

11:40.700 --> 11:43.077
Engine 51,
the water's flowing.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.208
Where's the water?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.293
- Pump's not working.
- Come on.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.713
All right. Here we go.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.550
Herrmann, water coming your way!

11:58.676 --> 11:59.802
It's coming.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.264
Battalion 25, be advised,

12:04.391 --> 12:06.809
closest units are currently responding
to a high-rise fire.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.395
Relief companies are en route
from Battalion 32.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.773
- 32 is across town!
- McLeod's cutbacks at work.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.237
Clear!

12:18.363 --> 12:19.530
This one's empty, too!

12:20.615 --> 12:22.950
That propane tanker's
too close for comfort.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.744
Knock those fires down!

12:25.870 --> 12:27.496
We got at least 30
people trapped in here.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.918
Sir, you're hurt.
Let's get you out of here.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.921
My daughter, she just went to the rear
to get her backpack.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.173
If you didn't see her inside,
she's on her way to triage.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.341
I'll take you.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.969
All the doors are jammed!

12:42.095 --> 12:43.345
Get them open!

12:43.471 --> 12:46.181
Tony and I are going to clear
the warehouse. Tony!

12:57.360 --> 12:58.527
Hello?

13:03.366 --> 13:04.491
Get back!

13:10.999 --> 13:12.207
Hang on, guys.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.545
- We need more triage tags.
- We need more everything.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.430
You OK?

13:26.556 --> 13:29.475
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.982
There's, uh...
There's more tags in the ambo.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.193
I'm going to get those.
Finish bandaging.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.113
Shay!

13:43.239 --> 13:44.990
Dawson, leg wound, he's losing blood.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.658
My daughter, Anna, is she here?

13:46.784 --> 13:48.494
She's ten.
She's wearing a striped sweater.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.413
Uh, no, sir. But I'll let you know
as soon as we see her.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.956
- What's your name?
- Marcus.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.250
Marcus?

13:55.376 --> 13:58.879
Marcus, there are a lot of others who
are in worse shape. Can you hang on?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.715
- Find my daughter!
- Striped sweater!

14:03.009 --> 14:04.134
Here you go.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.720
What are the different colors for?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.056
Just be glad you're
not wearing a black one.

14:15.772 --> 14:19.316
Remind me to thank this guy
for topping off his tank!

14:19.442 --> 14:21.527
Just keep the wet stuff
on the hot stuff.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.861
Hey, you OK?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.531
You OK?

14:27.283 --> 14:30.202
All right, hey. Stick with me.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.206
Here we go! Watch your step!
Watch your step! Take it easy.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.127
Careful, ma'am. Go slow.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.213
Watch your step.
Keep going, keep moving.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.975
- Sir! What the hell are you doing?
- Her eye.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.186
An epidural hemorrhage
is pushing on her brain.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.897
I have to release the pressure.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.320
A wine opener isn't ideal,
but when is life ideal, right?

15:05.446 --> 15:09.032
- She should be OK.
- Wow. Thanks.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.535
You can exit the way we came in.
We'll take it from here.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.204
No, no, there are at least ten more
back there. Let me help.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.331
I've got some
medical experience.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.750
- Obviously. What's your name?
- Westin.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.502
All right, Westin,
I appreciate the hand.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.171
Capp!
This one's gotta go first.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.759
Typical, huh? We ask for more ambos
and they send us police cars.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.178
- Mills! You need a hand?
- Yeah!

15:30.305 --> 15:33.307
Saw you signed up
for another CPD ride-along.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.350
Might as well get yourself
fitted for a uniform.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.519
Just help me get him to the tarp, man.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.150
Dawson!

15:43.276 --> 15:44.860
She's got a hole in her head.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.613
Red. Chief, we need
some more hands here.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.365
25 to Main, we can't wait
for those ambos.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.659
Activate the emergency
response team from Lakeshore.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.872
OK, there you go. Can you walk?
Come on.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.749
- You got him, Ton?
- Yeah.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.626
Capp, there's still
two in the back.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.545
All right, sir, you have to keep
pressure on that. I'll be right back.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.588
Westin!

16:04.714 --> 16:06.465
Hand me that strip
of cloth over there.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.303
That lets the paramedics
know he's got a tourniquet.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.640
Here.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.017
Combat medic, huh?
You coming or going?

16:18.770 --> 16:21.938
Between. Heading home for a week
to see the family.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.859
What about you, Marine,
when'd they cut you lose?

16:27.028 --> 16:29.655
Hey, come on, man,
I can smell jarhead a mile away.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.865
First Recon.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.076
So, basically you're working
on your golf game?

16:34.202 --> 16:36.995
Brought
my handicap down five strokes.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.456
I'll be right back. OK.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.832
Easy.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.211
Hey, Marcus! I told you to stay...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.922
Anna's not at triage.
I won't go back till I find her.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.383
Marcus!

16:49.509 --> 16:51.510
You're not going to be much good
on that leg.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.054
She lost her mom
to breast cancer last year.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.514
She's got to be so scared.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.141
Are you a father, Lieutenant?

16:59.769 --> 17:00.769
Yeah.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.397
So you know how I feel.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.900
Where were you guys sitting?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.569
There.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.947
All right, I'll find her.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.200
As long as you don't bleed out on me.
Back to triage.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.342
Redirect the lines, 81. We gotta get
water on that tanker, now!

17:32.468 --> 17:34.261
Herrmann! You got this?

17:34.387 --> 17:37.472
Got it, Lieutenant.
Let's go! Move those legs!

17:37.598 --> 17:39.266
Cool that propane!

17:39.392 --> 17:42.227
Give me one line on the fire
and two sheeting off the top.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.438
We've got to keep this rig cool.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.444
Anna!

17:51.779 --> 17:52.821
Anna!

17:53.489 --> 17:55.866
Severide, how many still trapped?

17:56.993 --> 17:58.744
There's less than ten
still in the warehouse,

17:58.870 --> 18:00.746
but a bunch more still
in the passenger car.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.424
Sir, you need to get back
in your car and drive away.

18:12.550 --> 18:16.553
It's tempting, but you look to be
about ten hands short of what you need.

18:18.389 --> 18:21.683
David Arata.
Chief of Trauma, Lakeshore.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.935
- OK, yeah, you'll do.
- What's your headcount?

18:24.061 --> 18:27.981
Uh, we're at 30 so far,
but we got more coming in.

18:28.107 --> 18:32.110
- Sir, move that man to the black tarp.
- No, wait, we haven't assessed him yet.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.572
Unless you have plasma,
which you don't, he's dead.

18:37.617 --> 18:42.454
I need any injured who can still walk
to keep walking. We need space to work.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.580
Let's go.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.460
Sheet off the top!

18:48.586 --> 18:50.420
Hit it from the other side!

19:04.352 --> 19:06.144
- You OK?
- I'm OK!

19:08.731 --> 19:10.315
What the hell is that?

19:10.441 --> 19:14.110
The pressure relief valve is venting!
Without it, this thing blows sky high!

19:14.237 --> 19:16.947
We better get these attack lines back!
We're going defensive!

19:17.073 --> 19:19.324
Go back! Come on!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.165
Back here! Something's wrong!

19:27.291 --> 19:30.836
He was wrapping my leg,
then he just fell back.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.254
Come on, Westin.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.677
What's wrong, Marine, never
seen a little bruise before?

19:38.803 --> 19:41.304
You of all people should know
how serious this is.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.599
You of all people know that no Army
medic walks out on the wounded.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.103
- Severide!
- Yeah?

19:48.229 --> 19:49.604
Help me out.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.399
OK, hold on. You're gonna be OK.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.819
Damn it!

19:56.904 --> 19:58.196
Something wrong?

19:58.322 --> 19:59.739
- Mm-mm.
- Good.

19:59.866 --> 20:03.535
- Head down, task at hand.
- OK.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.672
Anna!

20:19.510 --> 20:21.136
This candle ever going to go out?

20:21.262 --> 20:25.223
That propane's got to go someplace.
If it goes out, then we got to worry.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.767
Chief, pressure's falling
on the pumper.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.398
- Floor it.
- I think the seal's gone bad.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.109
We're losing pressure.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.197
Son of a bitch.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.825
Seal's just popped,
so we've lost pressure.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.785
Herrmann, set up an aerial pipe.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.705
We've got to squeeze every drop of water
onto that tanker, or it'll blow.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.373
Got it. Let's go! Get out of here!

20:50.499 --> 20:53.043
25 to Main, where's our back up?

20:53.169 --> 20:56.421
Delayed,
Battalion 25. Still 15 minutes out.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.675
Internal bleeding, I'm not sure how bad.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.678
- Let me help.
- I got it, Shay. Right here. Red.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.728
Black. We need the space.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.564
No! Dawson, take care of him.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.276
- It's OK.
- Red.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.531
OK. Fine.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.162
Hey, you all right?

21:32.500 --> 21:33.500
No.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.381
You can do this.
Just get through today, all right?

21:42.218 --> 21:43.593
Breathe in for me.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.471
Pipe's charged!

21:48.265 --> 21:51.851
- Here comes the water, Chief!
- Let's hope it lasts.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.271
Anna?

22:00.236 --> 22:03.238
Chief, we finished the primary
search for warehouse workers.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.281
- How many?
- 22.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.534
There were 24 cars
in the lot by my count.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.704
Today's payday. Our two bookkeepers
use the back office.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.707
Hey, Chief, there's possibly two workers
still in the back office.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.209
Mills! Grab your irons!

22:18.212 --> 22:19.879
Let's go. Go!

22:24.760 --> 22:27.262
Fire Department.
If you can hear me, call out!

22:27.388 --> 22:29.014
Chief, the warehouse
guy says

22:29.140 --> 22:31.516
the bookkeeper's working
in the third office from the back.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.738
Chicago Fire Department!
Call out if you can hear me!

22:46.407 --> 22:48.158
Up ahead on the left!

22:48.284 --> 22:49.576
Chief, wait!

22:57.376 --> 22:58.710
Mills?

22:58.836 --> 23:02.005
Yeah! Here. Here.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.969
- You OK?
- Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

23:08.763 --> 23:09.763
You?

23:09.889 --> 23:12.557
I'm good, I'm just... just trapped.

23:12.683 --> 23:16.644
Here. Um, let me try and...

23:16.771 --> 23:19.314
No! No!

23:21.275 --> 23:23.068
There could be a few tons above us.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.487
Let's just not push our luck. OK?

23:25.613 --> 23:27.030
Yeah.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.364
This is Boden.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.784
I'm with Mills. We're in the north end
of the warehouse.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.578
- There's been a collapse.
- On our way, Chief.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.131
That's it on the water.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.133
Engine's fried. Watch that tanker.

23:54.850 --> 23:58.561
Hey, Chief? The heat destroyed
the pressure release valve.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.979
What do you want us to do?

24:00.106 --> 24:03.233
That tank is going to blow, and it's
going to take the block with it.

24:09.782 --> 24:13.201
This is Battalion 25
to all fire and police personnel.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.538
Evacuate the area
to a quarter-mile perimeter.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.249
Repeat, evacuate the area.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.129
It's the right thing to do.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.260
I'm going to need confirmation

24:30.386 --> 24:33.847
that all first responders have
pulled back to a safe distance.

24:42.648 --> 24:46.109
- I got a job to finish.
- We're on the tanker.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.946
- The Chief ain't going out like this.
- Let's move.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.825
All right, everybody, let's go!

24:53.951 --> 24:55.827
People, if you can move, let's do it.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.412
We need to evacuate.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.873
- Sir, let's go.
- Not a chance.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.628
Uh, negative
on that confirmation, Chief.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.338
Herrmann, you listen to me.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.883
Chief, you know
they ain't going anywhere.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.850
- Hey, where did you come from?
- Back offices.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.310
How did you get out?

25:20.436 --> 25:22.520
Around back, but everything came down
right behind us.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.522
Let's go!

25:28.110 --> 25:30.236
We gotta release
and divert the gas flow.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.031
Will that coupling fit one of our hoses?

25:34.074 --> 25:35.074
Yeah, let's try it.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.534
Anna!

25:47.922 --> 25:49.923
Anna? Can you hear me?

25:58.807 --> 26:01.559
Hey, guys, secure the end of this hose.

26:02.311 --> 26:03.728
Let's attach it to the tracks.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.274
Move, guys! Let's move! I need a chain!

26:10.653 --> 26:11.861
Coming in.

26:15.991 --> 26:20.203
Hey, Westin? Westin, stay with me.
Stay with me, buddy.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.958
We have more incoming.
You need to ration your supplies.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.502
His vitals are 80 over 50.
He needs a second line.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.045
Hey. Hey!

26:30.339 --> 26:33.466
Keep moving. I'll handle this one.

26:54.405 --> 26:57.448
Well, I guess this isn't a good time
to ask if you're claustrophobic.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.911
Spent the better part of yesterday
trapped in an MRI.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.206
All I could think of
when I was in that machine

27:05.332 --> 27:07.083
was what I was going
do when I got out.

27:08.669 --> 27:09.752
This wasn't on the list.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.091
So, you got your test results, then?

27:16.051 --> 27:17.343
No, not yet.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.598
Maybe it's better I stay in here.
Not knowing.

27:22.725 --> 27:26.978
But if the results are clear,
you don't have to retire.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.856
Men who usually stay in the job
longer than they should

27:29.982 --> 27:31.774
live to regret that choice.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.820
You have any regrets?

27:42.453 --> 27:43.953
I'm done talking about me.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.000
Let's talk about you and the PD.

27:52.463 --> 27:53.838
Marcus!

27:53.964 --> 27:56.174
- Oh, no.
- I'm not giving up.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.509
Is there someplace else she could be?

27:58.635 --> 28:00.762
Our meal vouchers were in her backpack.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.597
She wanted to see
if they were good for lunch.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.766
Where did they sell food on the train?

28:11.482 --> 28:13.816
I know you think that I walked
into Police Academy

28:13.942 --> 28:16.319
because I got pushed
over for Squad.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.404
That's not the reason why.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.077
I wanted out because
I found out about you and my mom.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.341
A-ha!

28:38.467 --> 28:40.426
Come on! Now, quit lying around
and get out of there

28:40.552 --> 28:42.804
before this whole thing
blows to smithereens.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.181
Hose secure!

28:45.307 --> 28:46.557
Opening the valve!

28:48.102 --> 28:50.353
Coming out with
the Chief and Mills.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.822
Severide, how's that valve?

29:00.948 --> 29:01.989
Son of a bitch.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.993
I need vice grips up here!

29:06.120 --> 29:08.496
- Chief.
- Go.

29:12.835 --> 29:13.668
Hurry!

29:24.179 --> 29:25.513
Clear!

29:26.640 --> 29:28.099
Mills, how's your arm?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.329
Anna!

29:54.585 --> 29:55.668
Anna?

29:57.546 --> 30:00.465
I need a backboard over here! Hey.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.343
Can you hear me?

30:05.554 --> 30:06.971
My dad...

30:09.224 --> 30:10.725
He's waiting for you.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.650
- Hey! Hey, why aren't you treating him?
- What?

30:19.776 --> 30:22.570
He saved lives in there and you're
going to let him die in the dirt?

30:24.239 --> 30:28.868
Even if I had an ambulance, he wouldn't
make it to the hospital alive.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.786
I'm sorry.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.414
Hey, Jarhead...

30:38.253 --> 30:41.756
- You get the rest?
- Yeah, man, I did.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.551
I could have got you too
if you had told me earlier.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.765
And let you be the hero?

30:56.188 --> 30:57.438
Go to hell.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.998
All passengers, alive and dead,
are accounted for.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.376
- You disobeyed orders.
- Yeah.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.337
I suppose you taught us that.

31:22.214 --> 31:27.176
Chief, just know, if it were up to me,
you wouldn't be going anywhere.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.471
Thanks.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.099
Dawson. Shay.

31:33.225 --> 31:37.144
I remember you were doing rounds with
Hallie Thomas over at Lakeshore, right?

31:37.271 --> 31:39.438
- Designs on being a surgeon?
- That's right.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.608
You were extraordinary today.
Both of you.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.610
Call me anytime.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.154
I'm always willing
to help out good people.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.634
I understand you've had
quite a day today.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.137
It's calls like that that reflect
very well on this house.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.222
I don't give a damn how it reflects.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.979
We can't operate
without the support that we need.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.523
But you did today, didn't you?

32:23.900 --> 32:26.485
You worked with what you had
and you saved lives.

32:26.612 --> 32:30.740
So whether you like it or not, Chief,
the system works.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.163
But that's not your problem anymore.

32:37.289 --> 32:41.042
This is for your exit interview
tomorrow. Please fill it out.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.377
And remember to bring your badge.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.327
I actually missed this place.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.455
Heather!

33:21.667 --> 33:23.751
Why didn't you call?
I would have picked you up.

33:23.877 --> 33:27.296
Well, I wasn't going to stay there
a minute longer than necessary.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.633
I was hoping I could get the keys so
I can be there when the boys wake up.

33:30.759 --> 33:34.845
Sure, yeah. Um...

33:34.971 --> 33:37.556
They are going to lose their minds
when they see you.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.520
Matt, this whole thing...

33:44.064 --> 33:48.901
It's made me realize
I need to make some changes in my life.

33:49.986 --> 33:53.656
- Whatever you need.
- I know that. I do.

33:55.575 --> 33:59.662
But I also know that
when I wake up tomorrow,

33:59.788 --> 34:01.831
everything I see,

34:01.957 --> 34:06.043
everywhere I go, will remind me
of losing Andy and Jen.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.716
I've got this old friend in Florida.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.760
She owns an apartment building
and needs a manager.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.097
- It's rent free and it's a steady job.
- Heather.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.016
Take a little time.

34:21.143 --> 34:24.145
I've cleared it
with the probation department.

34:34.531 --> 34:38.367
Hey, Shay. Will you give me a minute?
We really need to talk.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.036
Not now, I'm... I'm fine.

34:51.715 --> 34:54.842
- Lover's quarrel?
- Just go.

35:13.069 --> 35:17.281
Mr. Boden, this is Dr. Carey.
Your test results came back negative.

35:18.492 --> 35:20.201
I'd like to get you tested every year,

35:20.327 --> 35:23.037
but there's no reason
you shouldn't get out and celebrate.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.705
Congratulations.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.880
You sure picked a hell of a call
to go out on.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.423
Sure did.

35:36.051 --> 35:39.887
- Peter, we should talk.
- Before...

35:43.517 --> 35:45.726
I was so mad at you,
I could barely look at you.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.439
And day after day, I've watched you

35:50.565 --> 35:54.026
put yourself on the line for this house,
for me.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.575
And now you're leaving, and...

36:02.661 --> 36:05.913
I realize what a waste of time
it was to be so mad.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.377
I regret that.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.337
And I wish I had that time back.

36:34.985 --> 36:35.860
What's up?

36:40.156 --> 36:41.615
You were right.

36:41.741 --> 36:45.786
Let's face it, when it comes to women,
I'm a world-class screw-up.

36:45.912 --> 36:50.291
Something goes wrong for me and I make
sure I scorch the earth as I leave town.

36:50.417 --> 36:54.879
I did it to your mother,
I did it to Katie's mom,

36:55.005 --> 36:56.797
and now I'm doing it again to Beth.

36:58.842 --> 37:02.761
She's probably going to divorce me, but
at least I can be around for the boys.

37:06.099 --> 37:08.100
I'm sorry I wasn't around for you.

37:10.270 --> 37:13.439
Anyway, they got soccer, so, uh...

37:13.565 --> 37:15.816
If I hit the road now
I should be able to make the game.

37:17.319 --> 37:20.154
That's good. Good.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.114
Yeah.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.160
Do me a favor, will you?

37:26.286 --> 37:32.082
Would you tell Wally, Chief Boden,
that, uh, 51 is his house.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.051
Oh, uh, one last thing.
Your sister Katie?

37:43.386 --> 37:46.597
I haven't spent much time with her,
but, uh...

37:46.723 --> 37:48.557
She seems like
a nice person.

37:51.561 --> 37:52.937
No promises.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.689
I'll see you, Kelly.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.405
It's difficult for me to accept

38:03.531 --> 38:06.116
that the department I've always known
is changing.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.162
That makes me somewhat of a dinosaur.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.124
But as difficult
as all those changes are,

38:15.919 --> 38:18.295
letting go of a lifetime's work,
that isn't easy.

38:23.176 --> 38:24.426
Jeff?

38:29.975 --> 38:31.433
I'm sorry.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.520
I am so sorry.

38:38.191 --> 38:40.109
There isn't a single man I've
served with

38:40.235 --> 38:43.404
who hasn't been brought to his knees
because of what he's seen on the job.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.407
Different endeavors in life
change people.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.869
Only the strongest are up for that.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.332
What makes them exceptional?

38:55.458 --> 38:57.584
No matter how hard they fall,

38:57.711 --> 39:00.254
they never give up when there's
something worth fighting for.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.132
You'll make a great Lieutenant.

39:04.217 --> 39:05.843
I don't know if I can handle

39:05.969 --> 39:08.762
waiting by the mailbox
for another rejection letter.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.473
Mm, I'm pretty sure
it'd come by email nowadays.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.809
Wow. Thanks so much, sweetie.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.981
When I was buried
under two tons of rubble,

39:19.107 --> 39:22.067
my men risked their lives
to pull me out,

39:22.193 --> 39:24.778
a nearly extinct old dinosaur like me.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.838
So to think about saddling them
with a broken system

39:42.964 --> 39:47.634
that strips away the essentials
so they can barely do their jobs,

39:47.761 --> 39:49.970
a broken system that might
keep one of my men or women

39:50.096 --> 39:54.475
from going home to their families,
I will not allow that.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.519
And I don't give a damn.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.272
I will have no regrets.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.819
You are not taking my house.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.822
Not without a fight.

40:24.214 --> 40:27.382
Do me a favor and take care
of your mom and brother, OK?

40:30.053 --> 40:31.261
You know, um...

40:35.016 --> 40:37.101
Your dad always used to tell me

40:37.227 --> 40:40.187
that we didn't become men
until we got our badges.

40:41.815 --> 40:45.400
His original badge will always hang
on the Academy wall,

40:45.527 --> 40:47.694
but we made this one for you.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.198
- Is this his number?
- Mm-hmm.

40:52.492 --> 40:56.578
I was in line right after him,
so our badges are only one number apart.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.871
See?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.293
Can I keep yours too?

41:07.173 --> 41:09.133
Absolutely.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.521
Hey.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.898
This is for you, so you don't forget us.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.990
Not a chance.
