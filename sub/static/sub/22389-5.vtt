â™ª â™ª

00:19.329 --> 00:20.899
[cheers and applause]

00:20.899 --> 00:22.230
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater

00:22.230 --> 00:23.769
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:23.769 --> 00:27.269
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan!

00:27.269 --> 00:30.269
[cheers and applause]

00:35.729 --> 00:37.530
- Hi.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.899
[laughs]

00:39.899 --> 00:42.200
Hi.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.729
Welcome
to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

00:44.729 --> 00:46.229
Since I started doing this,

00:46.229 --> 00:48.929
I figured I should learn
some magic,

00:48.929 --> 00:52.530
so I got the Penn & Teller
Magic Kit--in stores now--

00:52.530 --> 00:55.270
and I learned how to do this.

00:55.270 --> 00:59.170
First I have to enchant
the deck.

00:59.170 --> 01:03.030
And I'm gonna make
my favorite card,

01:03.030 --> 01:04.828
the ace of hearts,

01:04.828 --> 01:06.700
magically...

01:06.700 --> 01:08.829
appear.

01:08.829 --> 01:10.329
[exhales deeply]

01:10.329 --> 01:12.030
It's nerve-racking.

01:15.069 --> 01:18.170
[cheers and applause]

01:18.170 --> 01:19.829
I did it!

01:19.829 --> 01:22.000
[cheers and applause]

01:22.000 --> 01:25.170
And now the guys who taught me
everything I know,

01:25.170 --> 01:27.000
Penn and Teller!

01:27.000 --> 01:30.030
[cheers and applause]

01:30.030 --> 01:37.900
â™ª â™ª

01:37.900 --> 01:40.329
[cheers and applause]

01:40.329 --> 01:42.200
Did I fool you?
- Yes.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.430
[laughter]

01:43.430 --> 01:46.670
- Any performer who can fool
the mighty Penn and Teller

01:46.670 --> 01:49.569
earns a spot in their
Las Vegas spectacular,

01:49.569 --> 01:52.069
so let's meet
our first contender.

01:54.770 --> 01:57.770
- Hi, I'm Alex Ramon,
a magician and showman.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.829
[sultry jazz music]

01:59.829 --> 02:02.200
I was the first magician
and second-youngest ringmaster

02:02.200 --> 02:04.700
in the history
of Ringling Bros. Circus.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.230
Zing! Zang! Zoom!

02:06.230 --> 02:07.930
"Zing, zang, zoom" are
the magic words,

02:07.930 --> 02:09.000
not "abracadabra."

02:09.000 --> 02:10.370
We invented our own magic words.

02:10.370 --> 02:12.169
Come on.
Say it with me! Zing!

02:12.169 --> 02:13.900
Over here.
Zang!

02:13.900 --> 02:16.099
And on this side.
Zoom!

02:16.099 --> 02:19.030
Performing as the ringmaster
on Ringling Bros. Circus

02:19.030 --> 02:20.500
really was my graduate school.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.000
I learned so much

02:22.000 --> 02:25.099
performing in some of the
largest arenas in the world.

02:25.099 --> 02:28.069
I think the old magic
of the past

02:28.069 --> 02:32.400
has to be reengineered
to come up with something unique

02:32.400 --> 02:34.000
that no one's ever seen
before,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.500
and that's my job, and hopefully
I do that for my audience.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.770
[cheers and applause]

02:39.770 --> 02:44.370
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Alex Ramon.

02:44.370 --> 02:47.870
[cheers and applause]

02:47.870 --> 02:49.229
- Thank you.

02:49.229 --> 02:50.729
Thank you very much.

02:50.729 --> 02:53.229
My name is Alex Ramon,
and I've had the privilege

02:53.229 --> 02:55.900
of performing my magic
to millions around the world,

02:55.900 --> 02:58.329
and one thing I've found
they all have in common:

02:58.329 --> 03:00.770
no one ever trusts a magician.

03:00.770 --> 03:03.000
But as a magician, creating
an illusion in your mind

03:03.000 --> 03:05.099
is very different
than lying to people.

03:05.099 --> 03:08.000
See, I don't lie to people.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.400
- Ha!

03:09.400 --> 03:11.370
[laughter]

03:11.370 --> 03:12.830
- And I can tell
you think I'm lying

03:12.830 --> 03:14.099
when I say I don't lie
to people,

03:14.099 --> 03:15.569
but it's true.

03:15.569 --> 03:17.530
Trust me.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.599
After years of saying
that I'm an honest person,

03:19.599 --> 03:21.069
I thought I'd prove it
scientifically,

03:21.069 --> 03:23.930
which is why I grabbed my iPad.

03:23.930 --> 03:27.099
I went to the App Store,
and I downloaded a brand-new app

03:27.099 --> 03:29.670
which is a state-of-the-art
lie detector.

03:29.670 --> 03:32.099
And it's been specifically tuned
to the pitch in my voice,

03:32.099 --> 03:34.099
and it can recognize
and then analyze

03:34.099 --> 03:37.430
any inconsistencies
within my vocal patterns.

03:37.430 --> 03:40.270
At least
that's what the app says.

03:40.270 --> 03:42.030
And the best part is, it's free.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.030
[laughter]

03:43.030 --> 03:45.000
I'll show you how it works.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.030
The microphone in the front
listens to what I have to say.

03:47.030 --> 03:49.270
If I tell the truth,
if I decide to tell a lie,

03:49.270 --> 03:50.569
you'll all hear it.

03:50.569 --> 03:53.000
So if I say hello,
my name is Alex Ramon.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.069
I'm happy to be on "Fool Us"
performing my magic...

03:56.069 --> 03:57.329
[ding]

03:57.329 --> 03:58.670
That's the truth.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.199
If I say Teller needs to
keep it down a little bit...

04:01.199 --> 04:02.400
[buzz]

04:02.400 --> 04:04.729
You can see the difference
between the truth and a lie.

04:04.729 --> 04:06.069
Science is a wonderful thing.

04:06.069 --> 04:08.000
So today I thought
I would accept the challenge

04:08.000 --> 04:10.370
and finally put an end
to all the speculation.

04:10.370 --> 04:12.199
I'm actually going to attempt
an illusion

04:12.199 --> 04:15.199
using this iPad with
the lie detector app activated.

04:15.199 --> 04:17.399
And that way, you'll know
that I'm a trustworthy person

04:17.399 --> 04:20.199
and that my magic
has nothing to do at all

04:20.199 --> 04:21.029
with lying.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.430
[buzz]
Let me rephrase that.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.199
My magic has nothing to do
with deception.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.170
[buzz, buzz]

04:28.170 --> 04:30.269
Sometimes I tell the truth.

04:32.170 --> 04:33.100
[laughter]

04:33.100 --> 04:35.100
[ding]
Okay, that was close.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.199
Here's the idea.

04:36.199 --> 04:38.199
I'm gonna place the iPad
in this box.

04:38.199 --> 04:40.000
Now, you can see
the box is just big enough

04:40.000 --> 04:42.029
to hold the iPad perfectly.

04:42.029 --> 04:43.529
I'm gonna make the iPad
disappear,

04:43.529 --> 04:45.329
and I'm going to do it
by only telling the truth,

04:45.329 --> 04:46.899
and this app will make sure
of it.

04:46.899 --> 04:49.000
I think I should mention
this app already has

04:49.000 --> 04:53.370
over 3,500 reviews,
all of which are five stars.

04:53.370 --> 04:55.699
[buzz]

04:55.699 --> 04:57.170
I'll place the iPad in the box,

04:57.170 --> 04:59.069
and I hope
you're all watching closely.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.529
[buzz]

05:00.529 --> 05:03.199
I hope some of you
are going to watch me closely.

05:03.199 --> 05:04.500
[buzz]

05:04.500 --> 05:06.069
You can make this easier
for me

05:06.069 --> 05:08.329
if you'd all look away
for the next few minutes.

05:08.329 --> 05:09.370
[ding]

05:09.370 --> 05:11.000
[laughter and applause]

05:11.000 --> 05:12.029
All right.

05:12.029 --> 05:13.370
The amazing part is,

05:13.370 --> 05:15.230
if I wave my hands
and I snap my fingers like this,

05:15.230 --> 05:17.569
the iPad completely disappears.

05:17.569 --> 05:19.029
[buzz]

05:19.029 --> 05:21.000
The iPad appears to be gone.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.029
[buzz]

05:23.029 --> 05:24.230
You can't see it.

05:24.230 --> 05:25.269
[ding]

05:25.269 --> 05:27.370
[laughter]

05:27.370 --> 05:29.029
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.370
Look, I'll open up the door.

05:30.370 --> 05:31.829
You can see that I've done it.

05:31.829 --> 05:32.829
[buzz]

05:32.829 --> 05:34.000
You have no idea
where it could be.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
[buzz]

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Uh, you can't see it.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
[ding]

05:37.000 --> 05:38.829
[chuckles]

05:38.829 --> 05:40.199
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

05:40.199 --> 05:41.699
[buzz]

05:41.699 --> 05:43.399
[laughter]

05:43.399 --> 05:44.600
You're thinking that I must be

05:44.600 --> 05:46.199
an awfully clever magician--
[buzz]

05:46.199 --> 05:47.930
You're thinking I must have
studied for years

05:47.930 --> 05:49.100
to make the iPad--
[buzz]

05:49.100 --> 05:50.269
You're thinking
it's on the other side.

05:50.269 --> 05:51.699
[ding]
I'll show you.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.329
As you can see, the iPad's
completely gone.

05:53.329 --> 05:54.569
[buzz]

05:54.569 --> 05:56.029
As you can see,
it's no longer in the box.

05:56.029 --> 05:57.069
[buzz]

05:57.069 --> 05:58.600
As you can see,
you can't see it.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.870
[ding]

05:59.870 --> 06:02.199
[laughter]

06:02.199 --> 06:04.069
Look, you've seen this side
of the box.

06:04.069 --> 06:06.100
You've seen th--

06:06.100 --> 06:07.870
You've seen this side
of the box.

06:07.870 --> 06:10.069
[laughter]

06:10.069 --> 06:12.699
[cheers and applause]

06:12.699 --> 06:14.029
All right, look.

06:14.029 --> 06:16.029
This honesty thing is hard work.

06:16.029 --> 06:17.899
I thought you'd believe me,
but no one ever does,

06:17.899 --> 06:19.199
which is why
I'll have to prove it.

06:19.199 --> 06:21.069
And this is why
you should always believe me

06:21.069 --> 06:22.829
or believe I may tell
the truth occasionally.

06:22.829 --> 06:24.100
And if you remember anything,

06:24.100 --> 06:26.370
remember a dishonest person
tells the truth now and then.

06:26.370 --> 06:28.000
[cheers and applause]
Thank you very much.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.329
- That was so cool!

06:29.329 --> 06:30.699
- Thank you!
Thank you very much.

06:30.699 --> 06:31.699
- Oh!

06:31.699 --> 06:34.000
Oh, I really liked that!

06:34.000 --> 06:36.170
Because you really did
make it disappear.

06:36.170 --> 06:39.069
- Well, the question is,
do you trust me?

06:39.069 --> 06:41.569
- Well, should I trust you?

06:41.569 --> 06:43.069
[laughter]
- I don't know.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.199
- It's not that
I don't trust you.

06:44.199 --> 06:46.000
I just think
it's a trick question.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.500
Does that make sense?

06:47.500 --> 06:50.370
I'm like, "Well, yeah,
well..."

06:50.370 --> 06:51.769
- You can trust me.

06:51.769 --> 06:53.670
- But it's not
that I don't trust you.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.500
- In general, magicians.
- Yes.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.930
- Will you tell the audience
about when you were 16?

06:57.930 --> 06:59.000
- Oh, man. Okay.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
So I was 16 years old.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.029
I did magic shows.

07:02.029 --> 07:03.430
That's the only job
I've ever had,

07:03.430 --> 07:04.500
never done anything else.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.899
Did magic shows.
I saved my money.

07:05.899 --> 07:07.199
I bought me and my dad
a ticket.

07:07.199 --> 07:09.170
We went to
Caesars Magical Empire.

07:09.170 --> 07:12.069
We saw Penn and Teller.
We saw everybody, all the guys.

07:12.069 --> 07:14.000
And, of course,
at every single show,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.100
I'm dressed in, like,
a three-piece suit

07:17.100 --> 07:18.930
that is, like, so baggy.

07:18.930 --> 07:20.170
I looked ridiculous.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.029
I was, like, this 16-year-old
in this baggy suit

07:22.029 --> 07:23.600
going to all these magic shows.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.000
- Oh, but you probably thought
were you the coolest kid.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.899
- Oh, yeah, I thought
I was, like, you know--

07:27.899 --> 07:29.529
- "I'm gonna dress up."
- The big, wide tie.

07:29.529 --> 07:31.600
- And you saw Penn and Teller.
- I saw them.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.829
And I saw more magic shows
than I think I ever have

07:33.829 --> 07:34.870
in three days.

07:34.870 --> 07:36.170
- And here you are,

07:36.170 --> 07:37.870
performing in front
of Penn and Teller now.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.329
- Yeah.
- That is amazing.

07:39.329 --> 07:42.069
All right, well, I'm gonna
check in with Penn and Teller.

07:42.069 --> 07:43.069
[cheers and applause]

07:43.069 --> 07:44.600
Penn? Teller?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.069
What do you think?

07:46.069 --> 07:47.569
- It's great to see--

07:47.569 --> 07:49.500
you know, a lot of
the people on this show

07:49.500 --> 07:51.529
are very good at magic

07:51.529 --> 07:53.170
but haven't logged
the hours you've logged

07:53.170 --> 07:54.670
as a performer.

07:54.670 --> 07:57.269
Just one of the best performers
we've had on here.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.069
And it made it very difficult
to play the game,

08:00.069 --> 08:02.829
because I just wanted to relax
and watch the show,

08:02.829 --> 08:04.329
which I think is probably

08:04.329 --> 08:07.000
the biggest compliment
I can give you.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.699
I can also--
- Thank you.

08:08.699 --> 08:12.000
You know, I hear back--
since we're in our third season,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.029
I hear back from a lot
of young people

08:14.029 --> 08:15.000
that watch the show

08:15.000 --> 08:16.569
and want to learn magic
because of it.

08:16.569 --> 08:19.529
What they can learn from this
is how to take a trick

08:19.529 --> 08:22.670
that is a beginner trick
in magic, the die box--

08:22.670 --> 08:24.230
- Right.
- It's a trick you can buy.

08:24.230 --> 08:25.829
They can look it up on YouTube.

08:25.829 --> 08:27.199
They can go
right on the internet

08:27.199 --> 08:28.430
and type in "die box,"

08:28.430 --> 08:30.100
and they'll find out
all about it.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.529
They can learn this trick,
they can buy this trick,

08:32.529 --> 08:34.200
and they still won't know
how you did it,

08:34.200 --> 08:36.529
which I think
is a wonderful thing.

08:36.529 --> 08:39.669
It's called the Sucker Gag,
what you're doing there,

08:39.669 --> 08:41.399
and what you've done--

08:41.399 --> 08:44.230
which, to me,
is a complete miracle--

08:44.230 --> 08:46.570
is, you've made the die box--

08:46.570 --> 08:49.100
what's in the die box
interesting.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.169
And making the iPad
another character

08:51.169 --> 08:54.169
that answers back to your patter
is fabulous.

08:54.169 --> 08:58.169
It's so good, we wish
we didn't have a guess

08:58.169 --> 09:01.000
of how it's done,
and I think

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
there's a chance we're wrong.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.529
And if we're wrong,
we're gonna be very happy

09:05.529 --> 09:07.870
with you fooling us,
'cause you fooled us

09:07.870 --> 09:10.330
with everything--
with just pure showbiz,

09:10.330 --> 09:11.570
with good thinking,

09:11.570 --> 09:14.200
and with standing
on the shoulders of giants,

09:14.200 --> 09:16.500
taking the die box
and making it better.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.330
But we have a guess.
- All right.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.230
- And we're not giving it
to you without a guess.

09:20.230 --> 09:23.000
Teller's written something down,
and I want to see this.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.730
But it is a version
of the die box

09:25.730 --> 09:28.899
where the iPad goes...there.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.870
- Oh, no!
- Got it. Got it.

09:31.870 --> 09:33.669
- Oh!
- You are so good, man.

09:33.669 --> 09:35.169
- Thank you.
- You're so good.

09:35.169 --> 09:36.399
- They got it.

09:36.399 --> 09:39.200
Oh, but you were
such a joy to watch.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.669
- Oh, thank you.
- Such a joy.

09:40.669 --> 09:42.200
- Alex Ramon.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.100
[applause]

09:43.100 --> 09:45.870
So wonderful.
Thank you.

09:45.870 --> 09:49.070
- So good, man.
[cheers and applause]

09:49.070 --> 09:50.899
- More amazing tricks coming up,

09:50.899 --> 09:53.929
including one from
our very own Penn and Teller.

09:53.929 --> 09:56.100
More "Fool Us" after this.

09:56.100 --> 09:59.100
[jazz music]

10:06.070 --> 10:08.399
[jazz music]

10:08.399 --> 10:12.669
[cheers and applause]

10:12.669 --> 10:15.830
- Welcome back
to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

10:15.830 --> 10:19.029
home of the quickest hands
and minds on TV.

10:19.029 --> 10:21.070
Let's meet our next magician.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.100
- Magic's everything to me.

10:26.100 --> 10:31.100
I'm very much driven
on big movement and energy.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.669
I'm not a sit-down kind of guy.

10:33.669 --> 10:36.169
My wife and I decided
to open up our own theater

10:36.169 --> 10:37.870
in Niagara Falls.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.600
It's really been
a big challenge.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.070
Creative freedom is probably

10:41.070 --> 10:42.769
the biggest thing
the theater's offered me.

10:42.769 --> 10:44.200
I can do whatever I want.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.500
We can make people disappear,
reappear.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.700
We can do whatever we want
to fantasize.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.570
But that also comes
with a bit of a problem.

10:51.570 --> 10:54.870
I am now responsible for
everything that doesn't work.

10:54.870 --> 10:56.399
We have five tigers.

10:56.399 --> 10:58.330
We have a lot of birds
in the shows.

10:58.330 --> 11:00.100
Owning the theater
comes down to hard work.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.429
It sounds easy:

11:01.429 --> 11:03.399
"Open up a magic show,
and people will come."

11:03.399 --> 11:05.500
But it takes a lot of time,
a lot of energy,

11:05.500 --> 11:07.529
and you have to love it.

11:07.529 --> 11:09.830
If you don't, it's gonna
eat you up quick.

11:09.830 --> 11:13.570
[cheers and applause]

11:13.570 --> 11:16.570
- Our next performer comes
to us from Niagara Falls

11:16.570 --> 11:18.100
and arrived here by barrel,

11:18.100 --> 11:21.600
so please welcome
Greg Frewin.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.000
[cheers and applause]

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
[low, dramatic music]

11:27.000 --> 11:35.000
â™ª â™ª

12:43.600 --> 12:46.600
[dramatic percussive music]

12:46.600 --> 12:54.600
â™ª â™ª

12:59.700 --> 13:03.070

13:09.600 --> 13:12.600
[urgent dramatic music]

13:12.600 --> 13:20.600
â™ª â™ª

13:41.399 --> 13:43.000
- Oh!

13:43.000 --> 13:49.100
â™ª â™ª

13:49.100 --> 13:52.100
[cheers and applause]

14:10.399 --> 14:11.399
- Wow!

14:11.399 --> 14:13.169
That was incredible!

14:13.169 --> 14:14.200
- Thank you, Alyson.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.269
- Whoo!

14:15.269 --> 14:16.700
Oh, man, that was intense.

14:16.700 --> 14:17.899
- Thank you very much.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.029
- All right, so--

14:19.029 --> 14:20.529
- You're breathing
almost as hard as I am.

14:20.529 --> 14:22.700
- Well, I wasn't breathing
through that entire thing.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.929
I find myself, like,
holding my breath

14:24.929 --> 14:27.169
and then being a little dizzy
when I come out.

14:27.169 --> 14:28.529
But I'm glad you survived.

14:28.529 --> 14:29.700
- I did okay.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.830
- I'm a little worried
about your--

14:31.830 --> 14:33.100
your friend there.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.200
- Don't worry.
She knows the safe word.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.070
- Okay, good. Phew.
[laughter]

14:37.070 --> 14:38.570
So you live in Canada.

14:38.570 --> 14:40.100
- Yeah, I have a theater
up in Canada,

14:40.100 --> 14:42.370
in Niagara Falls,
the Greg Frewin Theatre.

14:42.370 --> 14:44.169
Took us about two months
to figure the name out.

14:44.169 --> 14:46.100
- Yeah.
[laughs]

14:46.100 --> 14:48.070
And you do acts like this
in your show?

14:48.070 --> 14:49.100
- That's correct.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.529
Our show's very large--

14:50.529 --> 14:51.730
illusions like this.

14:51.730 --> 14:55.029
I actually have 5 tigers,
about 30 birds,

14:55.029 --> 14:57.929
2 dogs, 2 kids,
and a wife.

14:57.929 --> 15:00.700
- Wow.
Who's the most trouble?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.029
- Uh, the husband.

15:02.029 --> 15:04.029
- Oh, good answer.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.730
Growing up, were your kids,
like, the most popular kids

15:06.730 --> 15:08.029
because you had five tigers?

15:08.029 --> 15:10.029
- Well, kind of.
Here's the interesting thing.

15:10.029 --> 15:12.070
My daughter actually
came home from school one day,

15:12.070 --> 15:13.929
and she said, "Dad,
I was at school,

15:13.929 --> 15:16.169
"and I said to my friends,
'Oh, I have cats.'

15:16.169 --> 15:18.200
And they said, 'Yeah,
we have cats too.'"

15:18.200 --> 15:19.870
And then she didn't realize

15:19.870 --> 15:22.169
that our cats are
a little bit bigger.

15:22.169 --> 15:25.769
- So is this a one-of-a-kind,
you created it and--

15:25.769 --> 15:26.769
- That's correct.

15:26.769 --> 15:28.399
This is actually
an illusion I created,

15:28.399 --> 15:30.070
and I actually
built this myself.

15:30.070 --> 15:32.000
- Well, that's amazing
and disturbing.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
- [laughs]

15:33.000 --> 15:34.070
- All right.

15:34.070 --> 15:36.000
Well, I've given them
enough time,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.100
so I'm gonna interrupt
whatever they're doing.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.830
- Uh-oh.
- Penn, Teller.

15:39.830 --> 15:41.500
- There you are,
interrupting us again.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.899
Man, this is
the biggest trick we've had,

15:44.899 --> 15:47.330
and in my world,
bigger is always better.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.169
- You and me
are both on the same page.

15:49.169 --> 15:50.169
- [laughs]

15:50.169 --> 15:51.230
And I'll also tell you

15:51.230 --> 15:54.200
that bigger is also
more difficult.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.029
- That's correct.

15:55.029 --> 15:57.169
- You can fool people
a lot easier

15:57.169 --> 15:58.899
with a small deck of cards...
- Sure.

15:58.899 --> 16:00.500
- Thank you can
with a big spectacle.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.230
- And it takes more people.
It's not just me.

16:02.230 --> 16:05.029
- Yeah, and you had
wonderful people assisting you,

16:05.029 --> 16:06.230
wonderful dancers.

16:06.230 --> 16:08.570
The whole production
is absolutely beautiful.

16:08.570 --> 16:11.230
You know, there's a technique
in magic,

16:11.230 --> 16:12.600
and I'm gonna say
the words here,

16:12.600 --> 16:15.100
because your use of it
is so good

16:15.100 --> 16:17.370
that I can almost give it away
without giving it away,

16:17.370 --> 16:20.899
because you've misdirected
from this principle so well.

16:20.899 --> 16:24.000
You're using black art,
which is a 19th-century term,

16:24.000 --> 16:29.330
and it's a way for the light
to hit the iris and confuse it

16:29.330 --> 16:31.370
so that people can become
invisible.

16:31.370 --> 16:34.070
It's really
a wonderful technique.

16:34.070 --> 16:36.529
The really crude way
of thinking of it is,

16:36.529 --> 16:39.200
I got a portrait of Elvis
at home, of course.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.899
I live in Vegas. You got to have
a portrait of Elvis.

16:41.899 --> 16:43.070
And it's gonna be on velvet.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.700
That's what we do
here in Vegas.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.230
We do pictures of Elvis
and Jesus on velvet.

16:47.230 --> 16:49.070
And when the light hits it
just right,

16:49.070 --> 16:50.870
all I can see is Elvis.

16:50.870 --> 16:52.000
And...
[laughter]

16:52.000 --> 16:53.769
That's the basic principle,

16:53.769 --> 16:56.769
and it's so well misdirected
that you have to have

16:56.769 --> 16:58.399
a pretty sophisticated knowledge
of magic

16:58.399 --> 16:59.570
to put this together.

16:59.570 --> 17:01.700
We thought it was beautiful
and the biggest

17:01.700 --> 17:03.529
and therefore the best.

17:03.529 --> 17:04.769
- Thank you very much.

17:04.769 --> 17:06.000
[cheers and applause]

17:06.000 --> 17:09.900
- So--so do they understand
how you did it?

17:09.900 --> 17:11.900
- Yeah, they've got an idea
how we did it.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.230
- They do.
- Now can I ask you a question?

17:14.230 --> 17:16.598
- Sure.
- Did I entertain you?

17:16.598 --> 17:18.430
- Tremendously.
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.368
- You entertained
all of us.

17:20.368 --> 17:22.200
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.098
Greg Frewin!
- Thank you.

17:24.098 --> 17:25.670
- Thank you.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.670
[cheers and applause]

17:27.670 --> 17:29.069
We've got plenty more magic,

17:29.069 --> 17:32.069
including something special
from Penn and Teller.

17:32.069 --> 17:34.200
Trust me, you don't want
to miss it.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.200
[jazz music]

17:44.170 --> 17:47.269
[jazz music]

17:47.269 --> 17:49.900
[cheers and applause]

17:49.900 --> 17:52.200
- Welcome back
to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

17:52.200 --> 17:55.069
Let's meet
our next potential fooler.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.329
- My name is Vinny Grosso.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.569
I perform a smart,
sophisticated,

18:01.569 --> 18:03.730
and sometimes cerebral type
of magic.

18:03.730 --> 18:07.170
I am a author, magician,
speaker, consultant.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.930
Very focused individual.

18:08.930 --> 18:11.200
Harry Houdini was
the longest-running president

18:11.200 --> 18:13.170
of the Society
of American Magicians.

18:13.170 --> 18:15.569
It's just crazy to think
that I was also the president

18:15.569 --> 18:17.000
of this organization.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.430
I've done this effect before
but not like this,

18:20.430 --> 18:23.000
and the way I've modified it

18:23.000 --> 18:25.829
is really an homage
to Penn and Teller.

18:25.829 --> 18:28.400
I can probably count
on one hand

18:28.400 --> 18:32.400
the number of times I've been
really nervous or fearful

18:32.400 --> 18:35.400
before a show or a routine
that I'm doing,

18:35.400 --> 18:37.200
and this is gonna be
one of them.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.730
[cheers and applause]

18:39.730 --> 18:45.869
- Give it up for the
always-classy Vinny Grosso!

18:45.869 --> 18:47.900
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.329
A magician wearing a tuxedo.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.069
How many of you get the sense

18:52.069 --> 18:54.069
that something cheesy's
about to go down?

18:54.069 --> 18:55.430
[laughter]

18:55.430 --> 18:56.700
Throughout my life,

18:56.700 --> 18:58.200
I've been labeled
a picky eater.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.900
Many people say I have
a problem.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.900
I like to think of it
as a gift.

19:02.900 --> 19:07.000
I have an acute,
superhuman-like sense of taste.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.700
I'll prove it
in the most scientific way

19:10.700 --> 19:12.369
a magician knows how:

19:12.369 --> 19:14.329
with a deck of cards.

19:14.329 --> 19:15.569
[laughter]

19:15.569 --> 19:17.599
And a volunteer.

19:17.599 --> 19:19.730
Choosing a volunteer,
there's an art to it.

19:19.730 --> 19:22.769
You need to find someone that
has just the right temperament,

19:22.769 --> 19:24.369
someone that won't upstage you.

19:24.369 --> 19:26.170
I found the perfect person
backstage.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.599
Please welcome Carrot Top.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.599
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[cheers and applause]

19:29.599 --> 19:31.029
Hi. Hello.

19:31.029 --> 19:32.900
How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.029
[cheers and applause]

19:35.029 --> 19:37.200
Hello, buddy.
Good to see you.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.500
This is fun, fun, fun.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.029
- Carrot Top,
can you inspect these?

19:41.029 --> 19:42.099
Great. Thank you.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.000
Check 'em out.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.730
Make sure there's
nothing wrong with it.

19:44.730 --> 19:47.200
I can tell that some of you
are skeptical.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.230
Well, at least two of you.

19:48.230 --> 19:52.069
So I'm going to eliminate
any possibility

19:52.069 --> 19:54.200
of me doing something sneaky.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.599
Nothing wrong
with the cards, right?

19:55.599 --> 19:56.930
- They look good.
- Okay.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.099
- A little out of order,
but they're good.

19:59.099 --> 20:02.029
- Uh, I'd like you
to check my ears out,

20:02.029 --> 20:04.700
make sure I'm not hiding
any sort of listening device.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.700
- Let's see here.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.829
- Nothing there?

20:06.829 --> 20:07.930
- Cough real quick.

20:07.930 --> 20:09.730
- [laughs]
We'll get to that.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.069
- You look good.
You look clean.

20:11.069 --> 20:12.369
You look clear.
- Great.

20:12.369 --> 20:14.369
I could be wearing a wire.

20:14.369 --> 20:16.069
You know, some sort of
signaling apparatus?

20:16.069 --> 20:17.400
- Yes, yes,
should I feel you up?

20:17.400 --> 20:18.769
- No, no.
- Okay.

20:18.769 --> 20:21.029
- They don't seem
terribly convinced.

20:21.029 --> 20:22.930
- Oh, wait.
Oh, my God.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.930
Oh, man.

20:23.930 --> 20:27.829
[cheers and applause]

20:27.829 --> 20:29.400
Ah!

20:31.000 --> 20:33.230
- They're not 100% convinced.

20:33.230 --> 20:35.000
- Now I need
the flashlight again.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.230
- And I'm not going there
with you.

20:37.230 --> 20:39.099
Uh, Carrot Top...

20:39.099 --> 20:40.000
- Yes.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.569
- You're gonna have
to vouch for them.

20:41.569 --> 20:44.099
- Okay.

20:44.099 --> 20:45.430
Do I stand here?
Stand here, yes?

20:45.430 --> 20:47.069
- Right over here.
- Over here, okay.

20:47.069 --> 20:49.730
Don't know what I'm doing.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.170
Oh, that's it! That--
Okay, good.

20:51.170 --> 20:52.200
That's it.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.000
Ah, man.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.099
[laughter and whistling]

20:57.099 --> 21:00.200
[cheers and applause]

21:04.099 --> 21:07.029
The water is very cold.
The water is very cold.

21:07.029 --> 21:08.529
[laughter]

21:08.529 --> 21:11.700
- Carrot Top.
- Yes? No!

21:11.700 --> 21:15.269
- Do you see anything funny--
let me rephrase that.

21:15.269 --> 21:16.900
Am I wearing a wire?

21:16.900 --> 21:19.029
- No, you're not wearing--
no, I don't believe so, no.

21:19.029 --> 21:22.029
I feel like Carrot Bottom
right now, but okay.

21:22.029 --> 21:23.400
[laughter]

21:23.400 --> 21:26.900
- Finally, I'm gonna eliminate
my sense of sight.

21:29.529 --> 21:31.230
- It's already better.
He can't see me.

21:31.230 --> 21:32.599
It's already better.

21:32.599 --> 21:33.869
We need one more piece
of tape.

21:33.869 --> 21:36.670
[laughter]

21:36.670 --> 21:38.269
- I need you to take
the card--

21:38.269 --> 21:39.430
- Oh, man!

21:39.430 --> 21:40.529
- Crap.
- Yeah.

21:40.529 --> 21:42.029
It's okay.
I carry a spare.

21:42.029 --> 21:43.029
- Oh, you--

21:43.029 --> 21:45.269
[laughter]

21:45.269 --> 21:46.730
Am I--am I supposed
to get these?

21:46.730 --> 21:49.400
- No, you can use these
right over here.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.170
- That's great.
That's great.

21:54.170 --> 21:55.829
- Can you check those out?

21:55.829 --> 21:57.200
- Check these out?
- Yeah.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.000
Make sure there's nothing wrong
with those either.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.430
And I'd also like you
to remove one card.

22:01.430 --> 22:02.430
- Okay.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.099
- And look at that card.

22:04.099 --> 22:05.769
Show it to the audience.

22:05.769 --> 22:08.670
Now, even though my eyes
are clearly shut,

22:08.670 --> 22:10.599
some people may think
I can peek.

22:10.599 --> 22:14.329
So never show the face
of the card to me, okay?

22:16.200 --> 22:17.170
I'll take that as a yes.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.029
[laughter]

22:19.029 --> 22:21.269
I've eliminated
any possibility

22:21.269 --> 22:22.930
of me knowing
what your card is,

22:22.930 --> 22:26.000
with the exception
of my incredible sense of taste.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.099
So I'm going to stick
my tongue out,

22:28.099 --> 22:31.829
and I'd like you tap
the card--just the tip--

22:31.829 --> 22:33.029
on my tongue.

22:33.029 --> 22:37.000
[laughter]

22:38.730 --> 22:41.599
- Should it--should it go back
in its holding spot?

22:41.599 --> 22:43.569
- With my acute sense
of taste...

22:43.569 --> 22:44.730
- It seemed easiest.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.900
- I can tell that your card
is red. Am I right?

22:46.900 --> 22:48.000
- Uh, yes.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
- Of course I am.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I get it, though,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.099
It could have been
a lucky guess.

22:51.099 --> 22:52.099
Tap it again.

22:52.099 --> 22:54.099
- Okay.

22:54.099 --> 22:56.430
You have a beautiful tongue,
by the way.

22:56.430 --> 22:57.829
- A diamond.

22:57.829 --> 22:59.000
audience: Oh!

22:59.000 --> 23:00.069
- Pretty good.

23:00.069 --> 23:01.230
- It was either that
or hearts.

23:01.230 --> 23:02.569
- Yeah, yes, yes.

23:02.569 --> 23:04.829
- Tap it one more time,
but hold it a second longer.

23:04.829 --> 23:06.930
- Okay.

23:06.930 --> 23:08.930
Now--now you're
getting weird.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.170
[laughter]

23:10.170 --> 23:14.000
- Carrot Top, with my acute,
superhuman-like sense of taste,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.170
I can tell that your card
is not just red,

23:16.170 --> 23:17.430
not only a diamond,

23:17.430 --> 23:19.869
but it is the king
of diamonds.

23:19.869 --> 23:21.170
[cheers and applause]

23:21.170 --> 23:22.869
- You're right!

23:22.869 --> 23:24.000
That's pretty good.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.529
That's pretty good.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.900
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Carrot Top.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.000
Thank you very much.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.200
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.529
Thank you.
Thanks, everybody.

23:31.529 --> 23:33.430
- Wow!
- How did you do that?

23:33.430 --> 23:35.529
- Ladies and gentlemen...

23:35.529 --> 23:37.099
Vinny Grosso!

23:37.099 --> 23:38.700
[applause]

23:38.700 --> 23:40.099
Okay, where are you?

23:40.099 --> 23:41.670
Nice to meet you.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.069
Hi.
- Hi.

23:43.069 --> 23:44.900
- Okay, this is
gonna be awkward.

23:44.900 --> 23:47.000
Can I stand over here?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Okay, well, first of all,
I want to thank you

23:49.000 --> 23:51.369
for letting Carrot Top be
your assistant

23:51.369 --> 23:52.400
and not me.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.730
- Should I be offended
by that?

23:54.730 --> 23:56.829
- Well, I just--
do you need some clothes?

23:56.829 --> 23:58.430
Should I help you?

23:58.430 --> 24:00.730
Okay, I'll just take off
my heels,

24:00.730 --> 24:03.400
'cause I don't think I want
to be too high up.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.869
[laughs nervously]

24:04.869 --> 24:07.069
There we go. That's better.

24:07.069 --> 24:08.930
That's much better.

24:08.930 --> 24:13.269
Um, and are you hoping
that by being naked,

24:13.269 --> 24:15.069
that's sort of
a distraction technique?

24:15.069 --> 24:16.930
- I--I don't know.

24:16.930 --> 24:18.069
You can't really
distract them.

24:18.069 --> 24:20.769
They've seen it all...
literally.

24:20.769 --> 24:23.029
[laughter]

24:23.029 --> 24:26.099
- Which one of us do you think
is more uncomfortable--

24:26.099 --> 24:27.400
you or me?

24:27.400 --> 24:29.269
- Since I've been doing this
quite a few times...

24:29.269 --> 24:30.670
- Probably me.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.569
- I was probably more than you
the first time I did this.

24:32.569 --> 24:33.569
But now...

24:33.569 --> 24:35.430
- "Eh."
- Yeah.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.700
- What if you fooled them?

24:36.700 --> 24:38.369
Are you gonna come out
to get your trophy?

24:38.369 --> 24:39.369
- Of course.

24:39.369 --> 24:40.599
- Really?
- No.

24:40.599 --> 24:41.829
- No? Okay, good.

24:41.829 --> 24:43.930
[laughter]

24:43.930 --> 24:46.269
Penn, Teller, let's help.

24:46.269 --> 24:48.029
Help me.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.529
Can you expose...
his trick.

24:50.529 --> 24:52.069
[laughter]

24:52.069 --> 24:55.200
[applause]

24:55.200 --> 24:57.500
- Boy, it's a great--
it's a great act.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.500
I do want to give you
a little bit of trivia.

25:00.500 --> 25:07.769
Uh, the first full-frontal
male nude onstage

25:07.769 --> 25:10.569
in Las Vegas on The Strip,
you know who that was?

25:10.569 --> 25:12.170
- Was it you two?
- Yes.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.329
- Yeah.
- We are the first people.

25:13.329 --> 25:14.400
We did a thing.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.099
We wanted to show
nothing up our sleeves.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.000
But you added to that

25:19.000 --> 25:20.569
the idea
of wearing a wire,

25:20.569 --> 25:21.869
which is really, really--

25:21.869 --> 25:25.000
everybody knows that from
police television shows,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.099
and adding that in
is really nice.

25:27.099 --> 25:29.200
This whole thing
is perfectly justified.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.200
It's really great.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.230
I also want to make clear--

25:31.230 --> 25:32.930
it's very important
to people at home--

25:32.930 --> 25:35.029
Carrot Top was not a stooge.

25:35.029 --> 25:37.230
Well, Carrot Top is a stooge

25:37.230 --> 25:38.670
in the sense
that he's a stooge...

25:38.670 --> 25:40.029
- There's nothing
prearranged.

25:40.029 --> 25:41.170
- But there's nothing
prearranged.

25:41.170 --> 25:42.599
He was not part of the trick
whatsoever.

25:42.599 --> 25:43.769
- He had no idea
what I was doing.

25:43.769 --> 25:45.029
- I also think--

25:45.029 --> 25:46.500
and I'm gonna ask you this.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.200
I believe the blindfold
is legit.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.730
Is that right?

25:49.730 --> 25:53.230
I'd never seen the eyelids
taped down with clear tape.

25:53.230 --> 25:55.829
When you put more stuff over it,
it's easier to fake,

25:55.829 --> 25:57.930
but I don't think you faked
the blindfold at all.

25:57.930 --> 25:59.029
- I didn't.

25:59.029 --> 26:00.599
- I think
it's an actual blindfold,

26:00.599 --> 26:02.529
and that's a really cool way
to do it.

26:02.529 --> 26:04.430
And Houdini, you know,
did a lot of stuff nude,

26:04.430 --> 26:07.099
and then he would use
the fact that he was nude

26:07.099 --> 26:08.170
and had something in the way

26:08.170 --> 26:10.069
to actually help
with the trick,

26:10.069 --> 26:14.730
and we think you've justified
that screen perfectly,

26:14.730 --> 26:17.670
and we do not trust
that screen.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.329
Could we look at that screen?

26:19.329 --> 26:20.670
Could we examine the screen?

26:20.670 --> 26:21.930
- Absolutely, you can.

26:21.930 --> 26:23.569
- We think there's some sort
of cuing device

26:23.569 --> 26:24.829
behind the screen.

26:24.829 --> 26:26.730
- I just want you to know
objects behind the screen

26:26.730 --> 26:28.529
appear smaller
than what they really are.

26:28.529 --> 26:31.529
[laughter]

26:32.900 --> 26:34.200
- Oh, my goodness!

26:34.200 --> 26:36.569
I'm so glad
I don't have their job.

26:36.569 --> 26:37.670
[laughter and applause]

26:37.670 --> 26:40.069
Wow. Wow.

26:40.069 --> 26:43.029
[cheers and applause]

26:43.029 --> 26:45.269
Wow.

26:45.269 --> 26:46.869
- You fooled us.

26:46.869 --> 26:48.069
- What?
- You fooled us.

26:48.069 --> 26:50.829
- Really?
[cheers and applause]

26:54.230 --> 26:56.700
- Whoo!
No, no.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.000
Hey.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.170
I'll let you get that.
Yep.

27:02.170 --> 27:03.430
[cheers and applause]

27:03.430 --> 27:04.730
No.

27:04.730 --> 27:06.200
Whoo!

27:06.200 --> 27:07.200
Okay--whoo!

27:07.200 --> 27:09.000
Oh, dear!

27:09.000 --> 27:11.069
Oh, my God!

27:11.069 --> 27:12.569
[laughter and applause]

27:12.569 --> 27:14.230
Hey!

27:14.230 --> 27:15.900
Thank you, Vinny.
Whoo!

27:15.900 --> 27:18.900
- He fooled us.
- He fooled 'em.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.029
Oh, my word.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.500
Oh, he can keep
that trophy. Ha ha.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.769
One successful fooler
so far.

27:28.769 --> 27:29.829
Will there be more?

27:29.829 --> 27:31.730
Find out after this.

27:31.730 --> 27:33.200
[cheers and applause]

27:33.200 --> 27:36.200
[jazz music]

27:43.329 --> 27:45.900
[jazz music]

27:45.900 --> 27:48.900
[cheers and applause]

27:50.200 --> 27:52.170
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

27:52.170 --> 27:54.829
Penn and Teller thought they had
that last guy figured out,

27:54.829 --> 27:56.170
but he fooled 'em.

27:56.170 --> 27:58.900
Let's see how they do
with our next performer.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.200
- Hi, I'm Arthur Trace,
and I'm The Artful Deceiver.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.000
[bell ringing]

28:06.000 --> 28:08.369
Initially, magic found me.

28:08.369 --> 28:09.869
I was in the second grade,

28:09.869 --> 28:12.170
and a teacher assigned
a take-home project

28:12.170 --> 28:14.500
which was basically an old trick
that magicians do

28:14.500 --> 28:16.000
known as the Cups and Balls.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.029
Once I learned how
to do that trick,

28:18.029 --> 28:19.700
I was hooked.

28:19.700 --> 28:23.069
Like any art, I think magic
adds a beauty to the world.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.529
If it allows audiences
to escape,

28:25.529 --> 28:27.400
that's a pretty major thing.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.000
Every artist has
an inspiration,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.400
and lately my inspiration
is time.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.529
How we keep track of time
is something

28:35.529 --> 28:37.529
that human beings invented.

28:37.529 --> 28:39.369
As a magician,
I can play with that

28:39.369 --> 28:42.069
and create different ways
of seeing time.

28:42.069 --> 28:45.170
[cheers and applause]

28:45.170 --> 28:48.200
- Our next performer met
and proposed to his wife

28:48.200 --> 28:50.269
in the famous Magic Castle,

28:50.269 --> 28:53.700
which means both she and his act
might be unreal.

28:53.700 --> 28:56.430
Please welcome Arthur Trace.

28:56.430 --> 29:00.269
[cheers and applause]

29:00.269 --> 29:03.170
[dramatic classical music]

29:03.170 --> 29:11.170
â™ª â™ª

29:16.170 --> 29:18.029
- Ta-da.

29:18.029 --> 29:19.569
[laughter]

29:19.569 --> 29:21.099
[scattered applause]

29:21.099 --> 29:23.269
No, that's not the trick.

29:23.269 --> 29:26.230
Tonight we're traveling
through another dimension.

29:26.230 --> 29:27.730
Oh, yeah.

29:27.730 --> 29:30.029
A dimension not only
of sight, sound, and mind

29:30.029 --> 29:33.430
but also of illusion.

29:38.529 --> 29:40.329
[laughter]
Yeah.

29:40.329 --> 29:44.500
[applause]

29:44.500 --> 29:47.599
You see, tonight I will leave it
up to you to decide

29:47.599 --> 29:51.000
what is real and...

29:51.000 --> 29:53.529
what is not.

29:53.529 --> 29:55.829
Wouldn't it be great
if there was a place

29:55.829 --> 29:59.269
where time...stood still?

29:59.269 --> 30:02.269
This idea
has always fascinated me.

30:02.269 --> 30:04.569
You see, if I could actually
control the flow of time,

30:04.569 --> 30:07.000
I could perform
some great magic.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.069
Now, you may find a better use
for stopping time

30:10.069 --> 30:11.329
other than a trick,

30:11.329 --> 30:13.569
although right now, the only
thing that I can think about

30:13.569 --> 30:15.670
is how to create
a better mystery.

30:15.670 --> 30:18.029
Alyson, would you please
join me center stage

30:18.029 --> 30:20.170
as the audience gives you
a thunderous round of applause?

30:20.170 --> 30:21.700
[cheers and applause]

30:21.700 --> 30:23.029
Very nice to meet you, Alyson.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.230
- Nice to meet you.

30:24.230 --> 30:26.000
- Alyson?
- Yes.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.430
- Here, here is what
you will be in charge of.

30:28.430 --> 30:29.430
- Okay.

30:29.430 --> 30:32.329
- The black bag.

30:32.329 --> 30:36.200
Please hold on to it like so,
like I'm holding it.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.500
- Okay.
- There you go.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.700
- Just take a peek inside,
seeing that it's empty.

30:39.700 --> 30:41.670
And then hold it
all the way to your right,

30:41.670 --> 30:44.099
just with your right hand
so I can't reach inside the bag.

30:44.099 --> 30:45.200
Yeah, all the way out.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.900
That way, I can't get
anywhere near it.

30:46.900 --> 30:50.200
Now, Alyson, here is
what I am in charge of.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.170
- Oh.

30:51.170 --> 30:52.700
- The egg.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.730
Alyson, my goal
is to get the egg from here

30:54.730 --> 30:57.200
to inside that bag
without you even knowing it,

30:57.200 --> 31:00.430
a feat that's much easier
to accomplish if I...

31:00.430 --> 31:02.930
[warbling]

31:02.930 --> 31:05.069
[laughter]

31:07.930 --> 31:09.769
Were to stop the flow
of time.

31:09.769 --> 31:11.230
[laughter]

31:11.230 --> 31:14.430
Now, to you, it may have
seemed like nothing happened,

31:14.430 --> 31:16.000
although while you were
frozen in time--

31:16.000 --> 31:18.200
and you were,
except for Alyson--

31:18.200 --> 31:21.099
I managed to put the egg--

31:21.099 --> 31:23.430
I'll take the bag,
Alyson, please.

31:23.430 --> 31:24.599
Thank you.

31:24.599 --> 31:27.430
The egg inside the bag.

31:27.430 --> 31:28.430
audience: Oh!

31:28.430 --> 31:33.099
[applause]

31:33.099 --> 31:35.569
Perhaps I can use
this same method

31:35.569 --> 31:36.900
in order to make it vanish.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.170
Alyson, please. You can
still feel the egg, yes?

31:39.170 --> 31:40.269
Yeah?
- Yes.

31:40.269 --> 31:41.269
- That is until...

31:41.269 --> 31:42.529
[warbling]

31:42.529 --> 31:45.869
[laughter]

31:45.869 --> 31:49.869
It disappears,
leaving nothing but the bag.

31:49.869 --> 31:52.200
You see, if you weren't
suspended in time,

31:52.200 --> 31:55.730
you would have seen that I
removed the egg from the bag

31:55.730 --> 31:59.170
and put it back inside
my jacket pocket.

31:59.170 --> 32:00.769
Any questions?

32:00.769 --> 32:03.869
[applause]

32:03.869 --> 32:05.230
Alyson, you're doing great.

32:05.230 --> 32:07.099
One last time, hold on
to the bag like so.

32:07.099 --> 32:09.029
- Okay.
- Just take a peek inside,

32:09.029 --> 32:10.069
seeing that it's empty.

32:10.069 --> 32:11.829
And then hold it all the way
to your right,

32:11.829 --> 32:12.869
just with your right hand,

32:12.869 --> 32:15.170
so I can't reach
inside the bag.

32:15.170 --> 32:19.069
The egg, all the way
from here to there.

32:19.069 --> 32:21.700
Once again,
the trickery takes place...

32:21.700 --> 32:22.869
[warbling]

32:22.869 --> 32:25.769
[laughter]

32:25.769 --> 32:28.170
During the suspension
of time.

32:29.569 --> 32:31.329
The proof?

32:31.329 --> 32:34.569
Yeah, the proof
is completely clear.

32:34.569 --> 32:35.730
You know, Alyson.
Go ahead.

32:35.730 --> 32:36.730
Give it a shake.

32:36.730 --> 32:37.829
I'll let you do the honor.

32:37.829 --> 32:39.099
Reach your hand
inside the bag

32:39.099 --> 32:40.369
and remove the egg.

32:40.369 --> 32:41.869
- What?

32:41.869 --> 32:43.099
- It worked!

32:43.099 --> 32:45.099
[cheers and applause]

32:45.099 --> 32:46.829
It worked.

32:48.529 --> 32:50.200
- That was crazy.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.269
[applause]

32:51.269 --> 32:53.200
- Now, some of you may feel

32:53.200 --> 32:54.869
the pausing of time
is just an illusion.

32:54.869 --> 32:57.029
But it's not the pausing of time
that's the illusion,

32:57.029 --> 33:01.369
but time itself
is the illusion,

33:01.369 --> 33:03.029
as you will notice
that the sand of time

33:03.029 --> 33:04.569
is completely gone.

33:04.569 --> 33:05.930
[audience exclaims]

33:05.930 --> 33:07.730
Alyson, if I may,
I'll take the egg, please.

33:07.730 --> 33:09.170
Thank you.

33:09.170 --> 33:14.099
After all, the concept of time,
it's a human invention.

33:14.099 --> 33:15.529
[objects clicking together]

33:15.529 --> 33:17.170
A concept
that was given birth to

33:17.170 --> 33:19.569
shortly after the creation
of life...

33:19.569 --> 33:20.829
[piano music]

33:20.829 --> 33:22.730
Itself.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.700
[cheers and applause]

33:31.700 --> 33:33.700
Thank you so much.
- Thank you!

33:33.700 --> 33:36.200
- The question still exists,
right?

33:36.200 --> 33:40.200
"Arthur Trace,
can you really stop time?"

33:40.200 --> 33:41.529
Well, that's kind of like
asking me

33:41.529 --> 33:44.730
if I really took a bite...

33:44.730 --> 33:45.730
out of that apple.

33:45.730 --> 33:47.430
â™ª â™ª

33:47.430 --> 33:49.230
Of course I did.

33:49.230 --> 33:50.230
[cheers and applause]

33:50.230 --> 33:52.269
And, by the way,
Penn and Teller,

33:52.269 --> 33:54.200
if you're hungry,

33:54.200 --> 33:57.269
the apple is all yours.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.500
[cheers and applause]

34:02.500 --> 34:05.170
- Wow.

34:05.170 --> 34:06.329
Amazing. Okay.

34:06.329 --> 34:09.030
So where can I get one of
these, um, time things?

34:09.030 --> 34:11.670
'Cause that would be
very helpful with my children.

34:11.670 --> 34:13.099
- I'll see you up, Alyson.
- Okay.

34:13.099 --> 34:14.570
So all this talking
and just--

34:14.570 --> 34:17.869
Does that make you feel like,
"Hey, that's pretty good"?

34:17.869 --> 34:19.670
That's a good sign,
rather than, like,

34:19.670 --> 34:21.869
"No, that's all right. We don't
need to talk about it."

34:21.869 --> 34:25.000
- They're--they're
pretty smart guys, so...

34:25.000 --> 34:26.929
- I know, but I think, like,
when they talk a lot--

34:26.929 --> 34:28.230
I mean, they're not,
like, talking

34:28.230 --> 34:29.869
about what they had
for dinner.

34:29.869 --> 34:31.699
- I don't know.
They could be.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.599
It looks--I mean, if they did
have something for dinner,

34:34.599 --> 34:36.170
it doesn't look like
it was very good.

34:36.170 --> 34:38.170
[laughter]

34:38.170 --> 34:40.670
- It does look like they're
ready or hungry.

34:40.670 --> 34:41.900
Let's see.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.199
Are you--are you ready?

34:43.199 --> 34:44.599
- Yes, I think we are.
- Okay.

34:44.599 --> 34:45.670
- Arthur, great act.

34:45.670 --> 34:46.829
I got to tell you,

34:46.829 --> 34:50.170
you're at a little bit
of a disadvantage.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.670
If you ask anyone
who's known me for years,

34:52.670 --> 34:54.070
they will tell you

34:54.070 --> 34:57.070
that the trick
that I hate the most in magic

34:57.070 --> 34:58.730
is the egg bag.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.500
Teller was working on it

35:00.500 --> 35:03.099
for months and months
and months

35:03.099 --> 35:04.829
when we were first
working together,

35:04.829 --> 35:09.030
and I never liked a single
[bleep] thing he did with it.

35:09.030 --> 35:10.099
[laughter]

35:10.099 --> 35:12.500
He tried every
presentation possible.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.929
The little weasel
has been trying

35:14.929 --> 35:17.530
to find some way
to sneak the egg bag

35:17.530 --> 35:20.170
into our show,
and he has never done it,

35:20.170 --> 35:23.070
because in Teller's hands,
it sucks.

35:23.070 --> 35:24.530
[laughter]

35:24.530 --> 35:28.429
But your version with the time
of a classic, the Malini--

35:28.429 --> 35:29.829
- Wait, wait!
Oh, wait.

35:29.829 --> 35:31.170
- You got to help him.
- It's back here.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.599
- I didn't see.

35:32.599 --> 35:34.099
- Egg bag...

35:34.099 --> 35:35.400
[laughter]
- Perfect.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.000
- Which is a classic of magic.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.869
And even though
I don't like it,

35:38.869 --> 35:41.230
you did it--you did it
really, really beautifully.

35:41.230 --> 35:44.699
And the apple and the bowl
and all the time stuff,

35:44.699 --> 35:49.329
it was just a wonderful turn
on Malini's egg bag.

35:49.329 --> 35:50.400
Just a wonderful,

35:50.400 --> 35:51.869
wonderful turn on it.

35:51.869 --> 35:52.929
Just fabulous.

35:52.929 --> 35:54.269
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

35:54.269 --> 35:56.070
- So are you confident

35:56.070 --> 35:59.099
they know how you did
stop time?

35:59.099 --> 36:01.400
- Yeah, they're right--
they're right on the apple.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.900
[laughter]

36:02.900 --> 36:05.730
- All right, well,
you are amazing to me...

36:05.730 --> 36:07.369
- Thank you, Alyson.
- And to everyone else.

36:07.369 --> 36:09.030
And thank you so much.

36:09.030 --> 36:11.030
Let's hear it
for Arthur Trace!

36:11.030 --> 36:12.170
[cheers and applause]

36:12.170 --> 36:14.530
Thank you. Bye.

36:17.070 --> 36:19.199
Up next, our grand finale,

36:19.199 --> 36:21.500
featuring our magic men
of the hour,

36:21.500 --> 36:23.570
Penn and Teller!

36:23.570 --> 36:26.570
[cheers and applause]

36:26.570 --> 36:28.570
[jazz music]

36:33.530 --> 36:35.900
[jazz music]

36:35.900 --> 36:38.900
[cheers and applause]

36:40.699 --> 36:42.829
- For over four decades,

36:42.829 --> 36:46.099
these boys have been dazzling
audiences around the world.

36:46.099 --> 36:48.000
Showing no signs
of slowing down,

36:48.000 --> 36:52.170
here are the unstoppable
Penn and Teller!

36:52.170 --> 36:54.170
- And don't go--
don't go running away.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.929
Stay right here,
'cause we're gonna--

36:55.929 --> 36:57.230
we're gonna teach Alyson
a trick.

36:57.230 --> 36:58.329
This is a simple trick.

36:58.329 --> 36:59.599
It's also a trick
you can learn,

36:59.599 --> 37:01.070
you can do at home
for your friends.

37:01.070 --> 37:02.599
We don't give away much
like that,

37:02.599 --> 37:03.869
so here's the whole thing.

37:03.869 --> 37:05.570
You see I'm gonna reach
in my pocket here

37:05.570 --> 37:07.170
and pull out a deck of cards.

37:07.170 --> 37:08.599
Now, this is a trick
you'll be able to do.

37:08.599 --> 37:09.670
You have a deck of cards.

37:09.670 --> 37:11.699
And just have somebody--

37:11.699 --> 37:13.829
You know, it doesn't matter
what card you pick.

37:13.829 --> 37:16.369
There's no card force
you have to learn.

37:16.369 --> 37:18.070
I'm gonna riffle,
and just say, "Stop."

37:18.070 --> 37:19.730
- Stop.
- It doesn't matter at all.

37:19.730 --> 37:21.400
And this is the card
you chose.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.000
I'm just gonna--
I can see it too.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.500
Normally, you wouldn't
see it yourself,

37:24.500 --> 37:26.000
but I was talking you
through it.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.730
It's a three of clubs
you chose, okay?

37:27.730 --> 37:28.769
I'm gonna take that card.

37:28.769 --> 37:30.170
I'm gonna put it
anywhere in the deck.

37:30.170 --> 37:33.170
You might notice I'm kind of
rubbing my fingers like this.

37:33.170 --> 37:34.329
You notice me doing that?
- Yeah.

37:34.329 --> 37:35.369
- When I went for the cards,

37:35.369 --> 37:37.030
I reached into both pockets
at once.

37:37.030 --> 37:39.400
Reason I reached into
both pockets at once is,

37:39.400 --> 37:42.269
I have in this pocket
a piece of bacon.

37:42.269 --> 37:43.500
- [laughs]
- Okay?

37:43.500 --> 37:45.869
Now, this bacon has
a strong smell to it,

37:45.869 --> 37:47.500
and I rubbed my fingers on it,

37:47.500 --> 37:50.030
and then when I came up and
you knew what card you picked,

37:50.030 --> 37:51.730
I rubbed it
all over the card.

37:51.730 --> 37:54.769
Now I could put that card
anywhere in the deck I want.

37:54.769 --> 37:57.030
I can have you shuffle them,
an audience member shuffle them.

37:57.030 --> 37:58.570
I can shuffle them.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.369
And that card is lost
in the deck,

38:00.369 --> 38:04.269
except it has that little bit
of nice greasy bacon smell.

38:04.269 --> 38:05.369
- Yeah.
- Okay?

38:05.369 --> 38:06.530
Then all you got to do is,

38:06.530 --> 38:08.670
once you got
the nice greasy bacon smell,

38:08.670 --> 38:09.900
all the work is done.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.070
Just find yourself a friend.

38:11.070 --> 38:13.730
I'm gonna use Teller
as the friend here.

38:13.730 --> 38:15.730
You put him
in a contraption like this.

38:15.730 --> 38:16.769
- Aw.

38:16.769 --> 38:18.199
- Have a seat
right here, Teller.

38:18.199 --> 38:20.230
Now, it's important to know
that I was using

38:20.230 --> 38:22.000
a kind of vegan bacon

38:22.000 --> 38:24.829
where there's no danger
of trichinosis,

38:24.829 --> 38:26.900
and the reason for that is,
you take the cards

38:26.900 --> 38:28.829
and put them
right in your friend's mouth,

38:28.829 --> 38:30.329
just like that, okay?

38:30.329 --> 38:31.900
Now, he's gonna do--

38:31.900 --> 38:33.199
he doesn't have to do
any work at all.

38:33.199 --> 38:34.599
He doesn't have to know
anything.

38:34.599 --> 38:35.869
I don't have to know anything.

38:35.869 --> 38:39.199
All you got to do is take
a little cloth like this

38:39.199 --> 38:41.400
and keep it a secret
by closing it up like this.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.869
Now, this is self-working.

38:42.869 --> 38:45.929
Remember, the audience,
when you're doing this at home,

38:45.929 --> 38:49.230
will not know that there's
a little bit of bacon smell

38:49.230 --> 38:50.329
on the card.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.570
They're not gonna know that.

38:51.570 --> 38:52.599
How could they know that?

38:52.599 --> 38:53.829
It's just in your left pocket.

38:53.829 --> 38:56.269
Then you go over
and you bring out animals,

38:56.269 --> 39:00.269
'cause they always love animals
in Las Vegas, right?

39:00.269 --> 39:02.730
Now, these are just a regular
bunch of--

39:02.730 --> 39:04.400
regular rats, I guess
they're called,

39:04.400 --> 39:06.730
Norwegian rats, or sewer rats.

39:06.730 --> 39:08.099
You can get these anywhere.

39:08.099 --> 39:10.530
We got these
out behind the Dumpster.

39:10.530 --> 39:12.000
They cost you nothing.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.230
They don't even
have to be trained,

39:13.230 --> 39:15.199
because from now on--
- One's coming out.

39:15.199 --> 39:17.230
- Oop, it--I think we're okay.
- No, it's fine.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.199
- From now on,
it's just instinct.

39:19.199 --> 39:22.099
Teller does no work.
I do no work.

39:22.099 --> 39:24.000
The rats do all the work.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.570
[audience exclaiming
and Teller yelling]

39:25.570 --> 39:26.929
You just throw them in
like that.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.570
You put them in.
You close it up.

39:28.570 --> 39:31.929
And then you just wait
for nature to do its work.

39:31.929 --> 39:34.199
Now, he doesn't--
audience doesn't know anything.

39:34.199 --> 39:36.530
And all of a sudden,
when the time is right,

39:36.530 --> 39:38.269
you just have to--
Come in here with me

39:38.269 --> 39:40.599
and say with me,
"Is this your card?"

39:40.599 --> 39:43.929
Ready?
Is this your card?

39:43.929 --> 39:45.929
The three of clubs.

39:45.929 --> 39:48.400
That's a trick
that you can do at home.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.829
You can do that
for your children right there.

39:50.829 --> 39:52.070
Three of clubs.

39:52.070 --> 39:53.599
- Oh, Teller!

39:53.599 --> 39:55.230
Oh!

39:55.230 --> 39:57.030
[cheers and applause]

39:57.030 --> 39:59.070
That's all.

39:59.070 --> 40:00.070
- Be back next week.

40:00.070 --> 40:02.230
- Yeah, I'm gonna go
get a medic.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.670
Good night.
We'll see you next week.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.900
[cheers and applause]
Teller? You okay?
