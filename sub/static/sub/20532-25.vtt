¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.544
<i>¶ I was a girl in the village</i>
<i> Doing all right ¶</i>

00:12.546 --> 00:14.947
<i> ¶ Then I became a princess</i>
<i> Overnight ¶</i>

00:14.949 --> 00:17.683
<i> ¶ Now I got to figure out</i>
<i> How to do it right ¶</i>

00:17.685 --> 00:19.485
<i> ¶ So much to learn and see ¶</i>

00:19.487 --> 00:22.621
<i> ¶ Up in the castle</i>
<i> With my new family ¶</i>

00:22.623 --> 00:25.324
<i> ¶ In a school</i>
<i> That's just for royalty ¶</i>

00:25.326 --> 00:29.528
<i> ¶ A whole enchanted world</i>
<i> Is waiting for me ¶</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:31.663
<i> ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶</i>

00:31.665 --> 00:32.731
<i> ¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:34.666
<i> ¶ I'm finding out ¶</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:36.702
<i> ¶ What being royal's</i>
<i> All about ¶</i>

00:36.704 --> 00:38.203
<i> ¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:39.671
<i> ¶ Making my way ¶</i>

00:39.673 --> 00:41.707
<i>¶ It's an adventure every day ¶</i>

00:41.709 --> 00:44.043
<i> -¶ Sofia ¶</i>
<i> -¶ It's gonna be my time ¶</i>

00:44.045 --> 00:45.711
<i> ¶ Sofia ¶</i>

00:45.713 --> 00:49.915
<i> ¶ To show them all</i>

00:58.759 --> 01:00.993
[reading onscreen text]

01:07.902 --> 01:10.602
-Hey, Sof, what's going on?
-Hi, Clover.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.271
I'm just cleaning out
my closet.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.739
Ever see these?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.507
They're Merlin's blocks.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.544
Anything you build with them
will magically float in midair.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.879
The more blocks you use,
the higher it floats.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.849
James once built a castle so big
it flew away.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.718
I think they found it
in Freezenburg.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.754
What? Wow!

01:28.756 --> 01:30.856
Oh, look.
My enchanted jump rope.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.158
Hey! Watch the ears.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.362
¶ Jumping, jumping
All the time ¶

01:37.364 --> 01:39.431
¶ Spell your name
And make a rhyme ¶

01:39.433 --> 01:41.366
¶ S-O-F-I-A ¶

01:41.368 --> 01:43.102
¶ Glad I spelled it right
Today ¶

01:43.104 --> 01:45.471
¶ Jumping, jumping all the-- ¶

01:45.473 --> 01:46.738
Ow!

01:46.740 --> 01:48.941
-[groans]
-Are you okay?

01:48.943 --> 01:51.910
I'm fine. Your magic rope,
it's defective.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.245
Don't feel bad, Clover.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.780
When Amber first showed me
how to use it,

01:54.782 --> 01:56.615
she jumped backwards
right into a fountain.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.584
[laughs and sighs]

01:58.586 --> 02:01.253
I always had the best time
playing with Amber and James.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.155
But with all of us going away
to school soon...

02:04.725 --> 02:06.725
I wonder if those days
are over.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.393
Maybe they'd want
to play with you now.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.728
Couldn't hurt to ask.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.997
You know what?
You're right, Clover.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.398
Thanks.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.403
Hi, Amber.
What are you up to?

02:18.405 --> 02:20.105
Studying up on diplomacy.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.841
I'm going to be queen one day,
and part of that is knowing

02:22.843 --> 02:25.644
how to improve relations
between kingdoms.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.646
But look what I found.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.815
-Oh, the enchanted jump rope!
-Yes!

02:29.817 --> 02:30.816
Want to jump with me?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.651
[gasps and clears throat]

02:32.653 --> 02:34.353
I've grown out of that, Sofia.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.656
Being heir to the throne
is a very grown-up job.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.259
So I only do
grown-up things now.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.593
[sighs]

02:41.595 --> 02:43.395
Okay, your loss.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.500
James, remember these?

02:48.502 --> 02:51.203
Merlin's blocks? Boom!

02:51.205 --> 02:53.839
Yeah. I thought it might be fun
to play with them again.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.276
I'd love to, but I'm really busy
practicing my lunge.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.510
[grunts]

02:58.512 --> 03:00.112
It looks pretty good to me.

03:00.114 --> 03:02.714
Meh, good isn't good enough.
It's got to be great

03:02.716 --> 03:04.683
if I want to impress everybody
at knight school.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.385
I'm sorry, Sofia.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.654
We just don't have time
to play with you.

03:08.656 --> 03:12.057
Merlin's blocks?
Oh, I loved those as a kid.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.725
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Baileywick.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.960
Hello, Prince--
[sneezes]

03:14.962 --> 03:17.362
[sneezing]
Prince--Sofia.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.231
-Do you have a cold?
-He does.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.400
And he's going to bed
right now.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.668
[sniffles]

03:22.670 --> 03:24.570
Yes, Your Highness.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.872
So, what are you up to, Dad?

03:26.874 --> 03:29.541
Well, it's Royal Staff Day,
so your mother and I

03:29.543 --> 03:32.244
are taking the castle staff
out for a picnic.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.712
Oh, that's nice.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.915
They work so hard, they deserve
some fun time as well.

03:36.917 --> 03:40.152
Now, I'm going to need you three
to hold down the fort today.

03:40.154 --> 03:41.420
Aside from Baileywick,

03:41.422 --> 03:43.355
you will be the only ones
in the castle.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.724
Oh! I can handle
everything, Daddy!

03:45.726 --> 03:47.359
[clears throat]

03:47.361 --> 03:50.362
It'll be good practice
for when I'm really in charge.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.198
Good. You can go to Baileywick
if you really need help,

03:53.200 --> 03:55.234
but try to let him rest.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.502
-You got it, Dad.
-We'll be back this afternoon.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.104
I have a peace summit scheduled

03:59.106 --> 04:02.574
to finally settle the
elf situation once and for all.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.109
As long as they
keep squabbling,

04:04.111 --> 04:05.944
they'll never
get that road built.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.247
Anyway, have fun today.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.249
-This is perfect.
-Oh, isn't it?

04:10.251 --> 04:13.852
I'll be in charge
of the whole castle today.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.854
And I'll be first knight
of the kingdom.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.789
-Like a grown-up.
-No.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.592
I meant, we have the whole
castle to play in.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.928
When will we get a chance
like this again?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.864
I see this as a chance
to be queenly.

04:25.866 --> 04:29.568
Yeah, and I see it as a chance
to be...knightly.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.303
Sorry, Sof.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.106
But everyone should have
some fun in their lives.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.508
Even queens and knights.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.411
¶ Put your sword down ¶

04:39.413 --> 04:41.280
¶ Close that book now ¶

04:41.282 --> 04:45.751
¶ It's time for the three of us
To play ¶

04:45.753 --> 04:47.786
¶ There's no one in the castle ¶

04:47.788 --> 04:49.888
¶ It won't be any hassle ¶

04:49.890 --> 04:53.492
¶ It's all our playground
Today ¶

04:53.494 --> 04:57.396
¶ Let's go do the things
We've always wanted to ¶

04:57.398 --> 05:01.667
¶ Skate on down the hallways
In our wheelie shoes ¶

05:01.669 --> 05:05.937
¶ We may be growing
But we're not grown-ups yet ¶

05:05.939 --> 05:10.475
¶ When we get busy
It's so easy to forget ¶

05:10.477 --> 05:14.079
¶ That you've got to have fun
Yeah ¶

05:14.081 --> 05:16.648
¶ You've got to have fun ¶

05:19.286 --> 05:23.822
¶ How does it feel
To do a cartwheel ¶

05:23.824 --> 05:27.993
¶ Through the throne room
Now and then? ¶

05:27.995 --> 05:31.997
¶ Or hiding and seeking
Behind an antique thing ¶

05:31.999 --> 05:33.265
Tag!

05:33.267 --> 05:35.367
¶ Hey, you're it again ¶

05:35.369 --> 05:39.371
¶ I forgot just how much fun
I have with you ¶

05:39.373 --> 05:43.675
¶ This empty castle
Is just like a dream come true ¶

05:43.677 --> 05:48.046
¶ We may be growing
But we're not grown-ups yet ¶

05:48.048 --> 05:52.984
¶ When you get busy
It's so easy to forget ¶

05:52.986 --> 05:56.488
¶ That you've got to have fun
Yeah ¶

05:56.490 --> 05:58.590
¶ You've got to have fun ¶

06:01.795 --> 06:05.897
¶ Sorry, but I've got more
Important things to do ¶

06:05.899 --> 06:10.535
¶ But making time to play
Is important too ¶

06:10.537 --> 06:14.506
¶ Oh, I don't know, Sofia
School is coming soon ¶

06:14.508 --> 06:18.877
¶ All the more reason
To join our happy tune ¶

06:21.081 --> 06:24.916
¶ Do you remember
Last September? ¶

06:24.918 --> 06:27.652
¶ We play musical
Magic wands ¶

06:27.654 --> 06:28.887
Oh!

06:28.889 --> 06:31.089
¶ James tried to cast
A fly spell ¶

06:31.091 --> 06:32.991
¶ The wand flew, but I fell ¶

06:32.993 --> 06:36.328
¶ Right into
The royal duck pond ¶

06:36.330 --> 06:40.532
¶ The three of us have always
Had the best of times ¶

06:40.534 --> 06:44.836
¶ Outside together playing
Till the dinner bell chimes ¶

06:44.838 --> 06:49.341
¶ We may be growing
But we're not grown-ups yet ¶

06:49.343 --> 06:54.112
¶ When we get busy
It's so easy to forget ¶

06:54.114 --> 06:57.916
¶ That you've got to have fun
Yeah ¶

06:57.918 --> 06:59.918
¶ You've got to have fun ¶

06:59.920 --> 07:02.621
¶ Yeah ¶

07:02.623 --> 07:06.057
¶ You've got to have fun
Yeah ¶

07:06.059 --> 07:08.660
¶ You've got to have fun ¶

07:11.398 --> 07:12.631
[laughs]

07:12.633 --> 07:13.932
[panting]

07:16.236 --> 07:17.669
[growls]

07:18.772 --> 07:20.105
You were right, Sofia.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.040
Having the castle to ourselves
is the best.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.376
-Ready, Rex?
-Children,

07:24.378 --> 07:26.111
this note just arrived
by messenger--

07:26.113 --> 07:27.579
[sneezes]
--pigeon.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.815
The flying coach your parents
took with the staff

07:29.817 --> 07:30.982
is having mechanical--

07:30.984 --> 07:32.951
[sneezing]
--mechanical--

07:32.953 --> 07:34.586
is broken.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.488
-Oh, no.
-Everyone is fine.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.823
[sniffles]

07:37.825 --> 07:39.758
They'll just be home
later than expected.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.427
But aren't the elves due
here soon for the peace summit?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.729
I will just have to entertain
them until the king--

07:44.731 --> 07:45.964
until he--

07:45.966 --> 07:46.965
[sneezes]

07:46.967 --> 07:48.233
--returns.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.335
I think you should
go back to bed.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.903
Sofia's right, Baileywick.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.139
We can take care
of everything.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.807
[sighs]
I don't know.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.510
Those elves can be difficult.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.178
You need to rest.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.147
We are perfectly capable
of entertaining the elves

08:02.149 --> 08:03.949
until Daddy gets here.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.184
Well...all right.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.119
The agenda's already made,
and so is the food.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.354
[sniffles]

08:09.356 --> 08:10.622
Come get me if--

08:10.624 --> 08:11.857
[sneezes]

08:11.859 --> 08:13.458
Come get me if--
[sneezing]

08:13.460 --> 08:14.860
Just come get me.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.265
Okay, boy,
ready to take off?

08:20.267 --> 08:22.834
James, wait.
You heard Baileywick.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.169
The elves are coming.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.205
Maybe we should stop
playing around and get ready.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.974
Come on.
One little ride.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.309
-Then we'll get ready.
-What can it hurt, Amber?

08:31.311 --> 08:32.878
Haven't you been
having fun?

08:32.880 --> 08:36.114
I have. Oh, okay!

08:36.116 --> 08:37.182
One ride.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.150
Yes! Go, Rex.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.185
[Rex howls]

08:40.187 --> 08:42.053
[kids cheer]

08:47.227 --> 08:48.226
[barking]

08:48.228 --> 08:51.062
Wait, Rex, look out!

08:54.835 --> 08:56.902
[crash]

08:56.904 --> 08:58.803
[all laughing]

08:59.973 --> 09:01.907
Oh, that was so fun!

09:03.143 --> 09:04.943
-Let's do it again!
-[loud knock on door]

09:11.251 --> 09:13.218
Is this the enchanted castle?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.486
[laughs]

09:14.488 --> 09:15.720
What?

09:15.722 --> 09:16.988
Oh! Uh, yes!

09:16.990 --> 09:18.223
[clears throat]

09:18.225 --> 09:19.658
Yes. It is.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.795
Well, that wasn't the kind
of greeting we were expecting.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.765
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.433
But I like it.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.535
Tree elves love magic.

09:30.537 --> 09:34.172
Especially tree magic.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.341
You call that magic?

09:36.343 --> 09:39.644
Let the river elves
show you how it's done.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.218
Hmph! There you go,
showing off again.

09:47.220 --> 09:51.089
Me? I'm not the one
wearing a tacky green tunic.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.090
-Hmph!
-Hmph!

09:52.092 --> 09:53.558
You see?
I told you

09:53.560 --> 09:55.360
we shouldn't have been
goofing off.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.796
-Look what we've done!
-We were just having fun.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.599
Well, the fun is over.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.867
Ahem, excuse me,

10:02.869 --> 10:06.304
but are you here
for the peace summit?

10:06.306 --> 10:07.772
Indeed we are.

10:07.774 --> 10:13.144
I am Arielf,
queen of the magical tree elves.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.146
More importantly,

10:15.148 --> 10:16.948
I am Elfabel,

10:16.950 --> 10:20.118
queen of the far more magical
river elves.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.320
I am Princess Amber,

10:22.322 --> 10:25.156
heir to the throne
of Enchancia.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.225
This is Prince James
and Princess Sofia.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.427
I'm afraid the king
has been delayed.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.229
His carriage
is having difficulty.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.631
But if you don't mind waiting...

10:32.633 --> 10:34.099
Oh, there's no need to wait.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.301
I would be happy
to run this peace summit

10:36.303 --> 10:37.702
in my father's place.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.171
Well, I have no objections,

10:40.173 --> 10:43.742
as long as the river elves
let us talk this time.

10:43.744 --> 10:47.646
We would, if tree elves had
something interesting to say.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.649
Um, Princess Amber, may we speak
with you for a moment?

10:50.651 --> 10:54.786
Oh, excuse me,
Your Highnesses.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.287
I don't think
this is a good idea.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.590
-Me either.
-Oh, why not?

10:58.592 --> 11:02.360
I have been reading all about
how to help kingdoms get along.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.296
This is a perfect time
to try out my diplomacy skills.

11:05.298 --> 11:09.100
But Dad has been trying to solve
the elf situation for years.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.336
It's really complicated.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.338
And it's very important to Dad.

11:13.340 --> 11:17.375
Then imagine how happy he'll be
when we get this resolved.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.811
-I don't know, Amber.
-Sounds risky.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.179
How about this?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.447
I'll go get Daddy's agenda.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.883
You know, his list of things
to do for the peace summit.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.352
And I'll follow it
to the letter.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.353
Okay?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.288
I guess that might work.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.557
So, ladies...

11:32.559 --> 11:34.325
Your Majesties.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.127
Nice weather we're having,
don't you think?

11:36.129 --> 11:38.563
We river elves
prefer it rain.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.665
We tree elves
prefer it leafy.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.301
Leafy? Is that even a thing?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.236
It most certainly is.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.471
Says who?

11:46.473 --> 11:49.674
Wow. I see why Dad can
never solve the elf situation.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.143
They really don't like
each other.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.511
I've met elves before,

11:53.513 --> 11:56.314
but they weren't arguing
all the time like these elves.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.982
They just wanted
to have fun.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.318
Okay, according
to the agenda,

12:00.320 --> 12:03.254
we should start by offering
our guests refreshments.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.891
Oh, the chefs already prepared
the food before they left.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.427
-You can read that?
-Just barely.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.596
Daddy's handwriting
is terrible.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.031
You two go get the food.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.666
I'll escort our guests
to the dining hall.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.001
-We're on it.
-Excuse me.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.503
-[thunder crashes]
-Would you mind

12:18.505 --> 12:20.772
turning off your magic?

12:22.676 --> 12:24.375
Thank you.

12:24.377 --> 12:27.245
Now, if you would please
follow me.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.114
We have some refreshments
for you.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.381
[chuckles]

12:30.383 --> 12:32.350
-Lead on.
-Very well.

12:32.352 --> 12:36.187
Welcome to the peace summit.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.422
Excuse me, princess,

12:37.424 --> 12:39.424
would you kindly
ask my counterpart

12:39.426 --> 12:41.926
to keep her tree magic
to herself?

12:41.928 --> 12:44.395
Ah! You did that
on purpose!

12:44.397 --> 12:46.397
I'm sure she didn't
mean to.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.866
Aah!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.634
You're not getting
the last laugh this time.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.369
Ow!

12:51.371 --> 12:53.772
Why, I ought to...

12:53.774 --> 12:56.307
Please don't do this!
You really should--

12:57.277 --> 12:58.409
Oh! Eat!

12:58.411 --> 13:00.545
[Elfabel]
Ooh, snack time.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.081
Yes. Good. Enjoy.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.050
Now, to the next item
on the agenda...

13:07.120 --> 13:08.419
James, a little help?

13:08.421 --> 13:09.420
In a second.

13:09.422 --> 13:13.158
Oh, this juice
is deliciously sweet.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.460
Yes satisfyingly sour.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.262
Sofia, can you read
Daddy's writing?

13:17.264 --> 13:20.398
It looks like,
"Aye your cheese fancies."

13:22.469 --> 13:24.502
These elves
sure love lemonade.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.738
James, what does this
look like to you?

13:26.740 --> 13:29.407
Uh...
"Aye your cheese fancies."

13:29.409 --> 13:31.009
But what does that mean?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.343
How should I know?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.845
You're the one who's going
to be queen.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.647
Oh! Maybe Baileywick can help.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.515
Go. We'll take care
of things here.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.117
I'll be right back.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.686
Is there more
sweet-sour juice?

13:41.688 --> 13:42.754
Coming right up.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.123
Are there more finger
sandwiches?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.492
-I could go for a bit of tea.
-Of course.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.928
At least they're eating
instead of arguing.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.329
Coming right up again.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.201
Oh!

14:01.174 --> 14:03.842
-Hey.
-Did they just smile?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.378
[giggles]

14:08.715 --> 14:11.182
It actually looks like
they're having fun.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.585
[slurps]

14:16.356 --> 14:17.522
-Hmph!
-Hmph!

14:17.524 --> 14:19.324
Or at least they were
having fun...

14:19.326 --> 14:21.459
-for a minute.
-Well, for the first time

14:21.461 --> 14:23.962
since they got here,
they seem to be getting along.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.563
We've got to keep
the fun going.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.065
[knock on door]

14:27.067 --> 14:28.566
Um, Baileywick?

14:28.568 --> 14:31.336
Oh, I'm so, so sorry
to bother you.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.403
It's not bother,
Princess--

14:32.405 --> 14:34.339
[sneezes]
--Amber.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.707
How can I help?

14:35.709 --> 14:37.976
I can't read Daddy's agenda
for the peace summit.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.344
What does this say?

14:39.346 --> 14:40.478
[sniffles]

14:40.480 --> 14:44.515
It says, "To have the elves
air their grievances."

14:44.517 --> 14:45.817
Air their grievances?

14:45.819 --> 14:50.221
"Aye, your cheese fancies...
air your grievances."

14:50.223 --> 14:53.024
Yes, I see it now.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.927
Each party must be given a
chance to say what bothers them

14:55.929 --> 14:57.896
so they can decide
how to fix it.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.163
[sneezes]

14:59.165 --> 15:01.266
Oh, thank you,
Baileywick.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.167
Feel better.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.070
So that thing with the cups
and saucers,

15:06.072 --> 15:08.072
was that something
you've done before?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.207
Dish-wishing?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.575
[chuckles]

15:10.577 --> 15:13.044
Oh, yes it's a favorite
pastime of us tree elves.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.547
But it was invented
by the river elves, of course.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.416
[sighs]
There you go again,

15:18.418 --> 15:20.852
always with the last word.

15:20.854 --> 15:23.221
Well, no matter
who invented it,

15:23.223 --> 15:25.423
it sure looked like you were
having fun doing it together.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.060
I guess we did used to have fun
dish-wishing with them.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.561
Until you broke

15:30.563 --> 15:33.898
my great-grandelf's best
family dish.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.568
For the millionth time,
it was an accident!

15:37.570 --> 15:40.538
And you didn't have to break
my family's best dish

15:40.540 --> 15:42.140
just to get back at me.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.642
Could you maybe show
my brother and I how it's done?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.612
We are going to be studying
elf history in school.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.814
We need to know
all about the elves.

15:49.816 --> 15:53.751
Well, I suppose there's no harm
in that.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.120
[sighs]
Just get us some more dishes.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.390
Ready or not,
here they come.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.031
Watch this.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.501
Beautiful!

16:14.741 --> 16:17.241
It's working.
They're really getting along.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.049
What is going on here?
Stop!

16:26.653 --> 16:28.419
We thought it would
help the elves get along

16:28.421 --> 16:31.122
if they had some fun together,
like they used to.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.423
That's ridiculous!

16:32.425 --> 16:34.359
But, Amber, it's working.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.027
Arielf, Elfabel,

16:36.029 --> 16:38.963
I'm sorry that my brother
and sister subjected you

16:38.965 --> 16:40.865
to this childish activity.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.201
Oh, we really don't mind.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.269
-We're good.
-You don't have to be polite.

16:45.271 --> 16:49.340
Don't worry, we can stop
all this playing

16:49.342 --> 16:51.709
and proceed with
the conference.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.278
We were kind of having fun.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.547
Well, now you get to stop
having fun

16:56.549 --> 16:59.117
and air your grievances.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.520
You each get to tell the other
what you're mad about.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.322
Oh! Isn't that great?

17:04.324 --> 17:05.990
We already know all that.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.558
Can't we just go back
to playing?

17:07.560 --> 17:11.462
I'm afraid not. The agenda says
you must air your grievances.

17:11.464 --> 17:15.633
Now, I insist you tell Elfabel
everything about her

17:15.635 --> 17:17.201
that drives you crazy.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.337
-Amber!
-Well,

17:19.339 --> 17:21.739
they do wear blue tunics.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.907
So silly.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.842
Not as silly as green.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.545
And they put "elf"
at the end of their names,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.714
when everyone knows it belongs
at the front.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.416
The front? Ha!

17:31.418 --> 17:34.318
-Nose-wiggler!
-Ear-tweaker!

17:34.320 --> 17:36.687
Oh, this isn't going
like it was supposed to.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.856
What are we supposed
to do next?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.092
Uh, how about some more
dish-wishing?

17:41.094 --> 17:44.162
I have no wish
to wish any dishes

17:44.164 --> 17:47.398
with the likes of you,
Elfabel.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.736
Well, I have no wish
to dish a--

17:51.738 --> 17:53.104
I mean, to dish a wish--

17:53.106 --> 17:54.739
Oh, just forget it!

17:54.741 --> 17:56.774
Please, you were having
so much fun together

17:56.776 --> 17:58.509
just a minute ago.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.677
Well, that was before
we remembered

17:59.679 --> 18:01.846
just how much
we can't stand them.

18:01.848 --> 18:05.683
I beg to differ.
It's us who can't stand you.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.085
How dare you?

18:07.087 --> 18:11.189
I am glad I broke
your great-grandelf's dish!

18:11.191 --> 18:13.257
That is it!

18:13.259 --> 18:15.860
We want nothing
to do with you ever again!

18:15.862 --> 18:20.598
Well, we want nothing to do
with you even more ever again.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.935
Oh, no, you're not walking out.
I am.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.804
[Sofia]
Wait! Arielf! Elfabel!

18:26.806 --> 18:28.272
Come back!

18:28.274 --> 18:30.608
Did I just ruin
the peace summit?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.610
Yup. Sure looks like it.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.745
And Dad will be home
any minute now.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.582
[sighs] I just wanted
to have a fun day.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.750
I thought we were making
progress with the elves.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.086
They were talking
and getting along.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.322
-But then--
-I took over.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.658
Well, you were just trying
to follow Dad's agenda.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.294
But I still think if we kept
the elves playing,

18:50.296 --> 18:52.063
everything would have
been fine.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.098
So much for acting
like a grown-up.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.268
I guess sometimes it's better
to just act like a kid.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.770
James, you are
absolutely right.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.806
-I am?
-And we can still

19:01.808 --> 19:03.841
save this peace summit.

19:03.843 --> 19:04.976
We'll just catch up
to the elves

19:04.978 --> 19:07.812
and get them to have fun
with each other again.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.680
Right. I'll go get
the Merlin's blocks

19:09.682 --> 19:11.115
and my magic jump rope.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.351
And I'll pack up
some drinks and treats.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.821
It's time to have
some serious fun.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.727
There they are.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.265
[horses whinny]

19:29.536 --> 19:32.837
My good elves, I'm afraid
you can't leave just yet.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.307
There is one last item
on the peace summit agenda.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.509
-Forget it.
-No, thank you.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.611
-Games!
-[both] Games?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.147
I realized I should never
have stopped you earlier

19:43.149 --> 19:46.117
when you were doing exactly
what you needed to do.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.319
-Uh, shouting?
-Insulting each other?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.321
No. Having fun!

19:50.323 --> 19:52.790
When you're having fun together,
you stop arguing.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.525
You don't care who wears
what color tunic,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.727
or even who broke
whose dish a long time ago.

19:56.729 --> 20:00.031
Whatever differences you have
just disappear.

20:00.033 --> 20:03.868
You know, there might be
something to that.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.737
Hmm. They are kind of fun
to play with.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.407
So, what sort of games
did you have in mind?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.709
You didn't happen to bring along
some more dishes, did you?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.611
Ready or not,
here they come.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.883
Well wished.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.385
Here's one that's just
off the top of my head.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.588
Or maybe yours.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.794
[laughs]

20:31.898 --> 20:33.531
Look, we brought
other fun stuff too.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.899
Show them, Amber.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.768
¶ Jumping, jumping
All the time ¶

20:37.770 --> 20:40.738
¶ Spell your name
And make a rhyme ¶

20:40.740 --> 20:43.241
¶ A-M-B-E-R ¶

20:43.243 --> 20:46.043
¶ I know I will go far ¶

20:46.045 --> 20:47.712
[laughs]

20:47.714 --> 20:50.948
¶ Jumping, jumping
All the time ¶

20:50.950 --> 20:54.619
¶ Spell your name
And make a rhyme ¶

20:54.621 --> 20:57.922
¶ A-R-I-E-L-F ¶

20:57.924 --> 21:01.425
¶ Why does nothing
Rhyme with F? ¶

21:02.362 --> 21:03.794
You're right, Sofia.

21:03.796 --> 21:07.531
I forgot how much fun it is
to have fun!

21:07.533 --> 21:08.966
Just put them together.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.135
The more you use,
the higher you float.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.382
Oh, thank you, Elfabel.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.816
You're welcome, Arielf.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.918
You know, I never did say
I was sorry

21:27.920 --> 21:29.820
for breaking your family's
best dish.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.123
Is it too late now?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.925
Oh, it's never too late
for that.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.228
And let me just add,
I actually kind of like

21:37.230 --> 21:39.930
your blue tunic after all.

21:39.932 --> 21:44.769
I was just thinking your green
tunic looks pretty sharp too.

21:44.771 --> 21:48.673
We also brought everything we
need for a little peace picnic.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.374
Who wants sweet-sour juice?

21:52.278 --> 21:54.779
[horses whinny]

21:54.781 --> 21:55.913
[laughing]

21:58.084 --> 21:59.750
You've got to show them
who's boss.

22:01.688 --> 22:05.089
May I present my father,
King Roland of Enchancia.

22:05.091 --> 22:09.293
King Roland, I believe you know
Queen Elfabel and Queen Arielf.

22:09.295 --> 22:10.995
Well, they're actually
getting along.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.432
I don't believe it.
You solved the elf situation.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.833
-Uh-huh.
-We did.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.468
-Yup.
-Well done, children.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.638
But I'm not sure I can call you
children anymore.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.440
You've really grown up.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.376
Actually, it wasn't being
grown up that saved the day.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.678
It was not being
too grown-up.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.347
Tag! You're it!

22:29.349 --> 22:31.615
[all laugh and chatter]
