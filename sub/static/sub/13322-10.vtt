WEBVTT

00:00.033 --> 00:01.310
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.374 --> 00:03.173
Ow! Aah!

00:03.209 --> 00:04.258
- That's a...
- Nail.

00:04.293 --> 00:06.276
It's embedded several
inches into his frontal lobe.

00:06.312 --> 00:09.129
You know, I'm at an increased
risk of having a seizure.

00:09.165 --> 00:10.214
So is this something you do now?

00:10.266 --> 00:11.231
You get high?

00:11.267 --> 00:13.117
Noah has a medical marijuana card.

00:13.169 --> 00:15.502
I took some of Jesus' ADHD pills.

00:15.504 --> 00:17.538
That's like taking speed. Are you crazy?

00:17.573 --> 00:20.474
- I can't believe you're still seeing Nick!
- What does it matter

00:20.509 --> 00:22.476
if he thinks that I'm his
girlfriend as long as he's locked up?

00:22.561 --> 00:23.794
Callie's caused Brandon a lot of trouble

00:23.829 --> 00:26.430
from the time she showed up.
And what about this Aaron kid?

00:26.482 --> 00:27.481
Is she yanking his chain too?

00:27.483 --> 00:30.250
Hey, anybody home? Police.

00:30.302 --> 00:31.485
You heard gunshots. You
were amped on adrenaline

00:31.520 --> 00:33.354
and I was lying on the ground.

00:33.356 --> 00:35.406
- Of course you thought that he still had the gun.
- But he didn't.

00:35.458 --> 00:37.424
I'm gonna talk to Robert
today, change my statement.

00:37.426 --> 00:39.393
They're gonna think you're
lying to cover my ass!

00:39.435 --> 00:41.402
There was other DNA on the murder weapon

00:41.454 --> 00:43.253
besides Martha Johnson's and Kyle's.

00:43.305 --> 00:45.189
Why did Kyle's lawyers never see this?

00:45.224 --> 00:46.323
Because Detective Gray
didn't want him to.

00:46.358 --> 00:47.491
Detective Joe Gray.

00:47.543 --> 00:49.593
I understand you're interested
in an old case of mine.

00:49.645 --> 00:52.246
If we can place another suspect
at Martha Johnson's house

00:52.248 --> 00:54.264
on the day she was murdered,
then we might get a judge

00:54.300 --> 00:56.517
to order them to give a DNA sample.

00:56.569 --> 00:58.202
Like our curb painter Doug Harvey.

00:59.588 --> 01:00.587
I want to go to Juilliard

01:00.639 --> 01:02.189
more than anything.

01:02.224 --> 01:03.524
Promise me that you will not hold back

01:03.526 --> 01:05.426
on this audition because you feel

01:05.461 --> 01:07.478
that you have an
obligation to this girl.

01:07.513 --> 01:09.530
Do you have any idea what
it takes to study here?

01:09.532 --> 01:12.332
What do I do then? Break up with her?

01:13.572 --> 01:16.557
So Rita called me and
she's up in Sacramento

01:16.609 --> 01:19.326
talking to like,
representatives and stuff,

01:19.378 --> 01:21.512
and the good news is
that Justina's bill died

01:21.514 --> 01:23.347
before it even made it to a vote.

01:23.399 --> 01:24.448
That's because of you, Callie.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.250
Yeah, but...

01:26.252 --> 01:28.268
so apparently, they've
got like, a ballot measure.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.320
You know, when they put
something out to the voters.

01:30.356 --> 01:32.306
- Like they did with Prop 8?
- Yeah, exactly.

01:32.341 --> 01:34.658
So they're calling it the
Foster Care Reform Bill,

01:34.693 --> 01:36.693
but, you know, of course it's
just the same terrible law

01:36.695 --> 01:40.297
that puts most of government
funding towards privatization.

01:40.332 --> 01:41.732
- They're relentless, aren't they?
- Yeah, and of course

01:41.734 --> 01:44.668
people are gonna vote for something
called "Foster Care Reform."

01:44.703 --> 01:46.603
Yeah. I mean, it sounds good to me.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.655
Exactly, and the only
way to get voters to see

01:48.691 --> 01:50.624
that there's, you know,
a better way to do things

01:50.676 --> 01:52.676
is to put a different
bill on the ballot,

01:52.678 --> 01:54.611
and they're calling it Jack's Law.

01:54.663 --> 01:57.381
Oh.

01:57.383 --> 01:59.483
- That way, voters can at least...
- See the difference?

01:59.485 --> 02:01.318
Yeah?

02:01.370 --> 02:02.486
Sounds like a good idea.

02:02.538 --> 02:05.305
Maybe the bills just
cancel each other out?

02:05.341 --> 02:07.457
Even that would be better than
Justina getting her law passed.

02:07.493 --> 02:11.261
So, they need 500,000 signatures

02:11.263 --> 02:12.679
to get the new bill on the ballot,

02:12.731 --> 02:17.267
so I was thinking since we're
all already going to the Bayfest

02:17.303 --> 02:19.269
to see Brandon's big reunion
with Someone's Little Sister...

02:19.271 --> 02:20.254
Mm-hmm?

02:20.289 --> 02:22.623
What if we had like a booth

02:22.675 --> 02:25.559
and, you know, like,
collected signatures

02:25.594 --> 02:26.710
and... and took donations?

02:26.745 --> 02:28.629
There's gonna be a ton of people there.

02:28.714 --> 02:31.531
Can I go? I... I mean,
I know I'm grounded,

02:31.567 --> 02:33.584
but it's not like Noah's
gonna be there, so.

02:33.636 --> 02:36.486
You're not grounded from family
things. Of course you can go.

02:39.425 --> 02:40.424
Uh, hey, Mama?

02:40.476 --> 02:42.476
Where's my refill? I'm almost out.

02:42.528 --> 02:44.328
- They haven't sent it yet?
- No.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.430
Uh, okay. I will call them tomorrow.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.282
Oh, my god.

02:48.317 --> 02:49.333
What?

02:50.419 --> 02:53.437
I... I got an email
from... from Juilliard.

02:53.472 --> 02:56.323
- And?
- Open it. Open it, love.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.708
I... I...

02:59.345 --> 03:00.644
What... where are you going?

03:00.646 --> 03:02.562
Where is he going?

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.631 --> 03:20.430
What?

03:20.466 --> 03:22.549
W... why isn't he doing anything?

03:24.470 --> 03:26.303
Oh, my god!

03:26.355 --> 03:27.437
Oh, my god!

03:27.473 --> 03:28.472
I... I got in!

03:28.507 --> 03:30.474
I got in! Oh, my god!

03:30.476 --> 03:32.326
Oh, my god, I got into...

03:32.361 --> 03:33.443
Oh, my...

03:33.495 --> 03:35.278
Oh, my...

03:35.314 --> 03:37.264
Oh, my god!

03:40.736 --> 03:42.252
Oh, my god!

03:43.288 --> 03:44.388
Let me see, let me see!

03:44.390 --> 03:45.689
- Come on!
- Okay, here.

03:45.724 --> 03:48.275
I... I didn't read it all.
I... I couldn't read it all.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.394
Oh, my god! Look at you!

04:24.900 --> 04:29.600
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:32.206 --> 04:33.622
Can't believe he did it.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.207
You know? It's one of those things that

04:35.259 --> 04:37.175
you talk about for years
and years and years,

04:37.211 --> 04:39.294
and then it finally
happens, and... and...

04:39.346 --> 04:41.546
I have to find a way to pay for it.

04:41.598 --> 04:43.181
We will.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.550
And I'm sure he's gonna get
a really good aid package.

04:45.602 --> 04:47.636
Yes, and hopefully I
will make detective,

04:47.688 --> 04:49.638
so that will take some of
the pressure off too, right?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.606
Honey, I don't want you to
do that just for the money.

04:51.642 --> 04:52.691
I'm not, I swear.

04:52.726 --> 04:56.228
I... I do really enjoy this
line of work, all right?

04:56.230 --> 04:57.562
And... and to be quite honest,

04:57.564 --> 04:58.730
it's time.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.233
You know, it's long past time
for me to get off the beat.

05:01.285 --> 05:03.568
Well, I know I'm gonna sleep better.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.203
I know, love.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.240
Me too, you know, if for no other reason

05:08.292 --> 05:10.208
than I won't have to
be on my feet all day,

05:10.244 --> 05:12.244
so hopefully my... my knees won't hurt

05:12.296 --> 05:14.579
all the time, and... and...

05:14.581 --> 05:17.249
ugh, won't have to put on
that damn uniform anymore.

05:17.301 --> 05:19.167
Hey, what's the matter with the uniform?

05:19.219 --> 05:21.219
It has been an honor to wear it everyday

05:21.255 --> 05:25.173
for the past 20 years,
but it's... it's polyblend

05:25.225 --> 05:28.226
and it's hot and it's
incredibly unattractive.

05:28.262 --> 05:31.179
It'd be fine with me
if I never saw it again.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.566
Never?

05:37.654 --> 05:39.271
Oh my.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.241
You have the right to remain silent.

05:44.278 --> 05:47.245
- Do I?
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.581
And you better start...

05:49.616 --> 05:51.166
right now.

05:51.201 --> 05:52.250
Oh.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.586
Okay.

06:00.177 --> 06:02.210
And after 20 years on the beat,

06:02.262 --> 06:03.261
I think that, uh,

06:03.297 --> 06:05.263
I think I finally
realized that my talents

06:05.299 --> 06:08.517
would probably be put to
better use elsewhere, so.

06:08.552 --> 06:10.552
Well, you know what?
I think you're right.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.138
We're always looking for
more female detectives,

06:13.140 --> 06:15.524
and to find someone with your
experience and commitment,

06:15.559 --> 06:17.609
well, we'd be lucky to have you.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.194
Thank you.

06:19.229 --> 06:21.146
- Of course, I've gotta run it up the ladder,
- Yes.

06:21.198 --> 06:23.148
But I think everything looks very good.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.566
And it doesn't hurt
that you've already got

06:24.618 --> 06:27.285
a recommendation from one of
our most decorated veterans.

06:29.239 --> 06:31.156
Someone put in a recommendation for me?

06:31.208 --> 06:32.574
Yeah. Gray.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.209
Joe Gray.

06:34.244 --> 06:36.211
I figured you knew him, asked him to.

06:38.332 --> 06:42.167
Yeah, I know him. Yup.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.219
And in the end, if so
many people had to die,

06:44.254 --> 06:47.172
well, that was just a
byproduct of our hero's journey.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.307
The Romans were pretty
merciless that day.

06:49.343 --> 06:52.260
Okay, more on this tomorrow.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.645
Make sure you've done your reading.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.647
Mariana, a word?

07:01.238 --> 07:02.571
- Yeah?
- So...

07:02.606 --> 07:05.190
I read your paper.

07:05.242 --> 07:06.241
It's not your best work.

07:06.276 --> 07:08.160
I expect a lot more from you.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.595
- _
- Oh, my god.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.197
I... I've just...

07:12.232 --> 07:14.149
I've been so busy with Robotics,

07:14.184 --> 07:15.167
I've gotten so far behind.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.551
I'm just... I'm just trying to catch up.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.436
You had the same time as everyone else.

07:19.490 --> 07:21.406
Please, if... if you can,

07:21.408 --> 07:23.341
can I just have this
weekend to make it better?

07:23.422 --> 07:25.488
I... I promise I will fix
it. Please. It's just...

07:25.524 --> 07:27.374
this will ruin my GPA.

07:28.544 --> 07:29.526
Okay.

07:29.561 --> 07:31.444
But I want it Monday. First thing.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.280
And it better be good.

07:33.315 --> 07:34.297
Okay.

07:44.359 --> 07:45.358
Hello?

07:45.410 --> 07:47.344
Hey. It's me.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.645
Hey.

07:49.681 --> 07:51.615
Um, I've got some good news.

07:52.701 --> 07:54.551
- What?
- I'm home.

07:56.688 --> 07:57.687
You are?

07:57.689 --> 07:59.589
Well, I mean, just for the weekend.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.474
They've got me on house arrest, so...

08:01.510 --> 08:02.609
I can't leave.

08:02.644 --> 08:04.494
Oh. Well...

08:04.529 --> 08:06.630
that must be nice, to
be home for a little bit.

08:06.632 --> 08:08.465
Yeah, it is.

08:08.517 --> 08:10.567
And you know the best part?

08:10.569 --> 08:12.485
You can come over.

08:12.537 --> 08:15.472
I can finally touch you again.

08:28.115 --> 08:29.114
Bad interview?

08:29.166 --> 08:32.000
No, great interview, in fact.

08:32.035 --> 08:34.953
Got a big, fancy detective
puttin' in a good word for me.

08:34.989 --> 08:36.004
Huh?

08:36.039 --> 08:39.308
Gray sent over a recommendation.

08:40.410 --> 08:41.960
The hell is that?

08:42.011 --> 08:44.396
Does he think that he can
just buy me, buy my silence?

08:44.431 --> 08:47.199
I'm just gonna owe him, be his bitch?

08:48.252 --> 08:50.319
He obviously doesn't know you very well.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.139
So, I mean, what are you gonna do?

08:54.174 --> 08:56.258
Are you gonna take
yourself out of the running?

08:58.245 --> 08:59.244
No.

09:03.017 --> 09:06.001
That's evidence that Benjamin
Torres was 14 years old

09:06.036 --> 09:07.085
when Molloy molested him.

09:07.137 --> 09:08.971
Give that to your friend in Vice

09:09.023 --> 09:11.957
and tell him that Gray threatened
to have Benjamin's parents deported.

09:12.980 --> 09:13.929
See what he can do with it.

09:13.981 --> 09:16.865
Okay. Are you sure you want to do this?

09:16.951 --> 09:18.800
It sounds like Gray is
keeping an eye on you.

09:20.221 --> 09:21.220
Yeah, I'm sure.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.843
I missed you.

09:27.895 --> 09:30.245
I'm so glad... you're home.

09:37.288 --> 09:39.238
Where are you going?

09:39.273 --> 09:41.106
You fell asleep.

09:42.142 --> 09:44.042
No, I didn't.

09:44.094 --> 09:45.127
It's okay.

09:46.197 --> 09:48.964
I'm sorry. I just...

09:48.999 --> 09:51.099
I haven't been sleeping like, at all.

09:52.987 --> 09:55.938
Hello. Just wanted to make sure
everyone was decent in here.

09:55.973 --> 09:57.039
Don't worry.

09:57.091 --> 10:00.058
Okay. Oh, Mat,
congratulations, by the way.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.843
On what?

10:01.879 --> 10:02.911
Getting into Berklee.

10:02.947 --> 10:03.962
Very happy for you.

10:04.014 --> 10:05.931
Thanks.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.334
You got into Berkeley?

10:09.370 --> 10:10.936
I didn't even know you applied there.

10:10.971 --> 10:13.188
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's no big deal.

10:13.224 --> 10:15.207
I... I don't even know if I want to go.

10:16.293 --> 10:18.176
You should probably take a nap.

10:18.229 --> 10:20.279
Call me later if you want.

11:07.227 --> 11:08.260
So...

11:08.262 --> 11:10.279
what do you have for me?

11:10.331 --> 11:12.331
Whatever it is, give it to me quick.

11:12.366 --> 11:14.299
Uh, this place is giving me
flashbacks to high school.

11:20.174 --> 11:21.139
Is this a hint?

11:21.175 --> 11:23.175
Are you trying to tell me something?

11:23.177 --> 11:24.977
It's from Doug Harvey.

11:26.063 --> 11:27.179
The curb painter?

11:27.214 --> 11:29.014
Yeah.

11:29.016 --> 11:30.365
Did you break into his house?

11:30.401 --> 11:32.968
Callie, what the hell? You could
have gotten yourself killed.

11:33.003 --> 11:34.136
Well, I didn't, so now we can see

11:34.171 --> 11:36.054
if Harvey's DNA matches
anything on the murder weapon.

11:37.157 --> 11:39.925
No, we can't. It's not admissible.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.960
What's the point? Not
to mention the fact

11:41.962 --> 11:43.362
that you broke a bunch
of laws to get it.

11:43.397 --> 11:44.863
Okay, what was I supposed to do?

11:44.915 --> 11:46.965
No, if you could have heard Kyle

11:46.967 --> 11:49.301
when he told me that they were
sending him to Folsom early...

11:49.353 --> 11:52.204
I'm telling you, if we can't figure out

11:52.256 --> 11:54.256
how to give him some hope at least...

11:54.291 --> 11:55.324
he's gonna...

11:56.360 --> 11:58.276
Okay, um...

11:58.329 --> 11:59.378
we'll get it tested.

11:59.413 --> 12:01.096
At least we'll know.

12:01.131 --> 12:03.231
As long as you promise not
to do anything stupid again.

12:03.283 --> 12:05.117
Okay.

12:05.152 --> 12:07.002
Callie, I'm serious.

12:12.159 --> 12:13.191
What?

12:13.193 --> 12:15.043
Nothing.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.095
What?

12:17.131 --> 12:19.064
I said nothing.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.983
- Was it Nick?
- Jesus!

12:22.036 --> 12:23.135
Whoa, he's home?

12:23.170 --> 12:24.936
You can't go see him.

12:24.972 --> 12:27.039
- Yeah, I know!
- I'm serious.

12:27.074 --> 12:28.957
Mariana, you can't go see him.

12:28.992 --> 12:31.877
I'm not going to. God.

12:31.912 --> 12:32.861
Well, then text him.

12:32.896 --> 12:33.862
- I will.
- Yeah?

12:34.965 --> 12:36.932
- Do it now.
- No, I'll do it later.

12:36.967 --> 12:37.983
No, you won't.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.067
Yes, I will, Jesus!

12:39.119 --> 12:40.902
I'll do it as soon as I'm
done with this stupid paper!

12:40.954 --> 12:41.953
Now leave me alone!

12:45.359 --> 12:46.358
Okay.

12:59.106 --> 13:02.174
See now, no sooner do
I try and help you out

13:02.226 --> 13:04.993
you go and make me regret it.

13:05.028 --> 13:07.045
Nobody asked for your help.

13:07.081 --> 13:09.014
Too high a price as far as I can see.

13:09.066 --> 13:10.949
All I did was ask you to stay out of it.

13:10.984 --> 13:12.084
And I did.

13:12.119 --> 13:13.969
Handing over evidence
to the guys in Vice

13:14.004 --> 13:15.887
doesn't seem like
staying out of it to me.

13:17.007 --> 13:19.991
So making detective, that's
not worth anything to you?

13:20.043 --> 13:20.992
Not this.

13:21.028 --> 13:23.845
What about having a job at all?

13:23.897 --> 13:25.864
Keep talking.

13:25.899 --> 13:27.833
Give me more to go to
Internal Affairs with.

13:27.885 --> 13:29.885
It's funny you should mention IA.

13:29.937 --> 13:31.903
I was thinking they'd be very interested

13:31.955 --> 13:34.956
in finding out how you tried
to cover for your ex-partner.

13:35.008 --> 13:36.875
Or was it your ex-husband?

13:36.910 --> 13:39.194
No, wait, it's both,

13:39.246 --> 13:42.914
when he was being investigated
for shooting an unarmed man.

13:42.916 --> 13:44.266
That's one thing about IA.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.118
They hate being lied to.

13:48.255 --> 13:52.174
You're not the only one who could
do a little digging, officer.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.127
You have a good night now.

14:12.473 --> 14:13.572
Okay.

14:13.607 --> 14:15.457
You're raising money for Kyle too?

14:15.493 --> 14:16.825
I thought it couldn't hurt.

14:18.429 --> 14:20.512
Wow, nice location, Callie.

14:20.564 --> 14:23.782
I think we could do some
damage from here, huh?

14:23.834 --> 14:26.385
Um, where do you want this?

14:26.420 --> 14:28.437
Uh, just across the back. Thanks.

14:28.439 --> 14:30.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:33.744 --> 14:36.362
Hey, AJ, come give me a hand.

14:36.397 --> 14:37.780
Hey!

14:37.815 --> 14:39.832
Hey! Oh, I love them!

14:39.867 --> 14:42.668
- Thank you so much for doing this!
- Of course.

14:43.771 --> 14:45.754
- Yes!
- Yay!

14:45.790 --> 14:48.657
Wow. There... there's two of you.

14:48.659 --> 14:51.677
That's... crazy.

14:51.729 --> 14:54.530
Um, I'm gonna go grab
the rest of the chairs.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.600
Okay, who is that? He was cute.

14:58.602 --> 15:00.436
Oh, that is Aaron.

15:00.488 --> 15:03.372
You know, the intern I told you about
from the Juvenile Justice Center.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.507
Oh, so he's smart too.

15:05.559 --> 15:07.443
Nice!

15:07.495 --> 15:08.527
Hey, Jude, I...

15:08.579 --> 15:11.363
Hey, what's up with Callie and that guy?

15:12.516 --> 15:13.549
Nothing.

15:13.551 --> 15:14.516
Why are you asking me that?

15:16.370 --> 15:17.403
Just looking out for you.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.505
Look, Mike, I know
you don't like Callie.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.390
Okay? But I do,

15:21.425 --> 15:22.775
and I'm gonna keep seeing her.

15:22.827 --> 15:24.460
And if you don't want
me to keep seeing her,

15:24.495 --> 15:25.711
well, that's too bad.

15:25.746 --> 15:26.945
I'm gonna be 18 soon,
and if you don't want me

15:26.981 --> 15:30.649
staying under your roof anymore,
I guess... I'll just move on.

15:40.761 --> 15:42.561
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:43.664 --> 15:46.548
Did... did your sister
tell you that I was home?

15:48.519 --> 15:49.518
You want to come in?

15:52.590 --> 15:55.357
Look, Mariana doesn't
want to say this to you

15:55.409 --> 15:57.493
because she doesn't want to,
you know, hurt your feelings

15:57.528 --> 15:59.528
I guess, but...

15:59.563 --> 16:01.447
she doesn't want to be with you anymore.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.415
She's with Mat now,

16:03.451 --> 16:05.384
so you have to leave her alone.

16:05.419 --> 16:07.352
Okay?

16:07.388 --> 16:08.771
Why didn't she tell me this herself?

16:10.825 --> 16:12.674
Because she's afraid of you.

16:23.821 --> 16:25.721
So we're calling it Jack's Law

16:25.756 --> 16:28.690
for my friend who was
killed in the system.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.659
Uh, so we just need enough signatures

16:30.694 --> 16:32.544
to get the bill on the ballot.

16:32.580 --> 16:33.662
I was a foster kid,

16:33.714 --> 16:35.631
so believe me, it's really important.

16:35.683 --> 16:37.699
Oh, we already signed
the Foster Care petition.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.501
You did?

16:39.537 --> 16:41.503
Yeah, about an hour ago
over by the entrance.

16:41.555 --> 16:42.504
Oh.

16:44.442 --> 16:45.491
That's weird.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.459
- We just got here.
- Yeah, I know.

16:48.579 --> 16:50.479
Or maybe they just didn't want to sign.

16:50.514 --> 16:52.364
Yeah, maybe.

16:52.399 --> 16:53.532
So there's this other bill

16:53.567 --> 16:55.501
that like, puts all the money

16:55.536 --> 16:57.753
into like, businesses
instead of for the kids,

16:57.805 --> 17:00.772
but we're trying to fight
that, so maybe you could sign?

17:00.825 --> 17:02.774
Um, I don't think so.

17:02.827 --> 17:04.425
I gotta meet my friends.

17:04.462 --> 17:05.676
Sorry.

17:07.397 --> 17:08.780
Couldn't close, huh?

17:19.760 --> 17:21.627
Thank you. Thanks.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.762
Hi, are you interested
in foster care reform?

17:24.815 --> 17:27.665
We just, uh, we need some signatures
to get our bill on the ballot.

17:27.701 --> 17:30.586
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

17:30.621 --> 17:31.737
Would you also consider donating to help

17:31.772 --> 17:33.655
Kyle Snow get a fair trial?

17:33.691 --> 17:35.624
He was wrongly convicted of murder.

17:35.626 --> 17:36.625
No, I won't.

17:37.678 --> 17:38.644
Okay.

17:40.648 --> 17:42.614
You know, you shouldn't be doing that.

17:42.666 --> 17:45.517
You're raising money for a murderer.

17:45.553 --> 17:47.519
Okay, well, he's not a murderer...

17:47.571 --> 17:48.570
Yes.

17:48.606 --> 17:50.372
He is.

17:51.425 --> 17:52.508
Um...

17:52.510 --> 17:53.775
I'm Troy Johnson.

17:53.827 --> 17:55.460
Martha was my grandmother.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.399
Oh.

18:00.434 --> 18:02.317
See, a friend of mine
called me this morning

18:02.319 --> 18:04.703
to tell me about this,
and I didn't believe it.

18:05.723 --> 18:07.356
You have to stop.

18:07.391 --> 18:09.741
I just got my mother
back after years of her

18:09.793 --> 18:11.677
being so depressed, she
couldn't even get out of bed.

18:11.712 --> 18:15.781
I'm sure this has been
really hard for you all,

18:15.833 --> 18:18.584
but Kyle is a victim here too, okay?

18:18.636 --> 18:20.519
- He did not do this.
- Yes, he did.

18:20.571 --> 18:22.604
No, he didn't. The detective
on your grandmother's case

18:22.656 --> 18:24.706
made sure that he was convicted
even though there was evidence

18:24.742 --> 18:27.559
that points to somebody else, okay?

18:27.595 --> 18:30.445
Don't you want the person
that's responsible to be found?

18:30.497 --> 18:33.532
Look, Kyle is guilty.

18:33.567 --> 18:36.401
I know that, and so did the jury.

18:36.437 --> 18:38.453
And I'm sorry if you
have convinced yourself

18:38.489 --> 18:40.422
of some cockamamie theory,

18:40.424 --> 18:42.391
but please let this go.

18:43.527 --> 18:44.826
For my family's sake.

18:50.331 --> 18:53.298
Hi there. Can we talk to you for
a minute about foster care reform?

18:55.352 --> 18:57.719
Okay, this is so frustrating.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.673
What is going on? Why
aren't you working the crowd?

19:01.675 --> 19:03.609
You're much better at
harassing people than I am.

19:06.514 --> 19:07.546
I, uh...

19:09.617 --> 19:13.452
Detective Gray came to visit me
as I was leaving work yesterday.

19:13.487 --> 19:14.603
- Again?
- Yeah,

19:14.638 --> 19:17.356
and he, uh, threatened to go to IA

19:17.408 --> 19:18.557
if I didn't drop the whole thing.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.426
He knows about how I covered
for Mike after the shooting.

19:22.479 --> 19:24.563
- How does he know about that?
- I have no idea.

19:24.565 --> 19:27.299
Does this mean you could lose your job?

19:29.520 --> 19:31.236
Honey,

19:31.288 --> 19:32.404
you don't have to make detective.

19:32.406 --> 19:33.438
That's fine. We're gonna be fine.

19:33.474 --> 19:35.724
But if you lose your job...

19:35.776 --> 19:37.326
you have to let this go.

19:37.361 --> 19:39.328
Hey, listen, there's a child molester

19:39.380 --> 19:41.730
still out on those streets
thanks to Detective Gray.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.298
And an innocent kid is sitting,

19:43.334 --> 19:44.650
rotting away his life in jail.

19:44.702 --> 19:45.751
How am I supposed to
walk away from that?

19:45.753 --> 19:47.586
There are other people
who can take this on.

19:47.638 --> 19:49.721
- Well...
- Let the JJC handle it.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.306
Isn't that what they're there for?

19:51.342 --> 19:53.575
They're not gonna get justice
for Benjamin Torres, Lena.

19:53.627 --> 19:54.626
They're not.

19:54.678 --> 19:56.728
This is an issue of
integrity for me, Lena.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.614
- Why can't you see that?
- You... you are the one

19:58.649 --> 20:00.566
who's always saying that
we can't save them all.

20:01.685 --> 20:03.569
And you know what?
Sometimes you have to.

20:03.604 --> 20:05.571
You have to compromise your integrity.

20:05.606 --> 20:07.422
It sucks, but it's true.

20:08.592 --> 20:10.475
You do what you have to do
for the sake of your family.

20:12.613 --> 20:15.414
Excuse me, uh, can I talk

20:15.416 --> 20:18.333
to you for a second about,
uh, foster care reform?

20:18.369 --> 20:20.485
Hi, do you have a moment
to talk about foster care...

20:39.356 --> 20:40.389
Hi.

20:40.424 --> 20:42.691
Do you have a moment to
talk about serious reforms

20:42.726 --> 20:43.809
needed in the foster system?

20:43.844 --> 20:46.595
- Sure.
- My team and I are collecting signatures

20:46.630 --> 20:47.763
to get a really important
bill on the ballot

20:47.798 --> 20:49.564
and would...

20:49.600 --> 20:51.617
Wait a minute, I know you, don't I?

20:53.604 --> 20:55.554
I mean, Berkeley?
That's eight hours away,

20:55.556 --> 20:57.522
and he didn't even tell
me he was going to apply,

20:57.558 --> 20:59.491
and it's because he knew that I
was going to be upset. That's why.

20:59.543 --> 21:02.427
At least it's not one of those schools
that he was looking at on the East Coast.

21:02.479 --> 21:03.595
And my grandparents live
nearby, so I can visit,

21:03.647 --> 21:06.448
and... and... it's...
it's just a year, right?

21:06.500 --> 21:09.451
Are you... okay?

21:09.486 --> 21:11.320
No.

21:11.355 --> 21:14.373
Maybe. I don't know.
I'm gonna get these guys.

21:14.408 --> 21:15.374
Excuse me.

21:15.426 --> 21:16.425
Hi.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.477
Are you familiar with Jack's Law?

21:18.479 --> 21:21.396
Uh, we're trying to get another
reform bill placed on the ballot.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.400
So Justina's people are here too.

21:25.436 --> 21:27.319
- For real?
- Yeah.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.371
Guess we weren't the only
ones with the brilliant idea

21:29.406 --> 21:30.722
of getting signatures here.

21:30.758 --> 21:33.358
But I am not going to let
them have the upper hand.

21:33.394 --> 21:35.694
I'm going to work harder
and I need a new petition.

21:35.696 --> 21:37.329
Already?

21:37.364 --> 21:39.598
Damn, that is impressive.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.767
But of course, if we
were all as cute as you,

21:41.802 --> 21:44.569
I'm sure we'd be on
our fourth petition too.

21:45.656 --> 21:47.589
Are you serious right now?

21:47.641 --> 21:49.675
I'm standing right here.

21:49.727 --> 21:51.526
What?

21:51.578 --> 21:54.496
You know what. Stop hitting
on my girlfriend, man.

21:54.548 --> 21:55.547
I know you kissed her.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.616
And I've been trying
to be chill with you,

21:57.651 --> 21:59.484
but every time I turn
around, you're making moves.

21:59.536 --> 22:00.602
- AJ...
- Stay in your lane, man.

22:00.637 --> 22:04.373
- For real.
- AJ, he's just playing.

22:04.408 --> 22:05.390
Well, that's enough playing.

22:05.442 --> 22:07.526
Does he always get this worked up?

22:07.578 --> 22:09.294
Seriously?

22:09.346 --> 22:12.381
You really want to
start something with me?

22:12.416 --> 22:14.449
You're about half my size
on a good day, little man.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.468
I will break you, so
watch your damn mouth.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.354
Okay, okay, you know what, um...

22:19.390 --> 22:20.852
Aaron, he has a point, okay?

22:20.853 --> 22:22.313
And you need to stop
pressing people's buttons...

22:22.409 --> 22:24.376
but you need to shut the hell up

22:24.411 --> 22:26.712
- and stop being such a jerk.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

22:26.764 --> 22:27.813
Oh, good! Yeah, yeah, yeah, great!

22:27.848 --> 22:29.664
I'm sure you think that
I've created all this drama,

22:29.700 --> 22:31.700
that I'm just yanking
everyone's chain, right?

22:31.752 --> 22:33.205
- Callie, I don't know...
- No, Mike.

22:33.206 --> 22:34.456
It's actually none of your business

22:34.458 --> 22:35.479
and I don't care what you think,

22:35.480 --> 22:36.980
so you need to stay the
hell out of it, okay?

22:37.608 --> 22:38.673
Dammit. Aaron!

22:40.627 --> 22:41.676
What was that?

22:41.729 --> 22:44.696
Come on, Mike. You always
blame her for everything.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.466
- What?
- It's not fair, and you know it.

22:47.501 --> 22:49.551
AJ, I have nothing
against Callie personally.

22:49.603 --> 22:50.669
I... I'm just... I worry.

22:50.704 --> 22:53.455
Look, let's be clear about one thing.

22:53.490 --> 22:54.539
You're family.

22:54.575 --> 22:56.508
Hey, you're not going
anywhere no matter how I feel

22:56.560 --> 22:58.527
about your love life.

22:58.562 --> 23:01.379
Okay? You always have a home with me.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.484
Hey, can we stop soon? I'm starving.

23:05.486 --> 23:07.402
We just had lunch.

23:09.339 --> 23:11.406
Excuse me, sir?

23:11.442 --> 23:14.326
Would you sign our petition
for foster care reform?

23:20.734 --> 23:22.334
Some people are weird.

23:22.386 --> 23:23.668
No kidding.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.272
Come on. Let's go.

23:38.132 --> 23:40.900
- Excuse me, would you two...
- You got what you wanted.

23:40.902 --> 23:42.067
Aaron went home.

23:42.069 --> 23:43.903
Good.

23:43.938 --> 23:45.004
You are such a jackass.

23:45.056 --> 23:47.806
How am I the jackass here, Callie?

23:47.842 --> 23:48.908
You're the one that pulled away from me

23:48.943 --> 23:50.743
when I tried to kiss you this morning.

23:50.795 --> 23:51.927
And then you went and comforted him

23:51.963 --> 23:53.762
after all those shots he took at me.

23:53.814 --> 23:55.915
Okay, I didn't pull
away because of Aaron,

23:55.950 --> 23:57.783
I pulled away 'cause Mike was there.

23:57.835 --> 23:59.885
And yeah, I... I went after
him because of what you said.

23:59.887 --> 24:01.128
- It was so shady,
- What?

24:01.129 --> 24:02.529
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

24:02.707 --> 24:03.739
Calling him out for his size,

24:03.774 --> 24:05.124
obviously he's sensitive about that.

24:05.126 --> 24:06.709
Well, obviously I'm sensitive

24:06.761 --> 24:08.694
about some dude hitting
on my girlfriend.

24:08.729 --> 24:10.746
Okay, Aaron is trans, AJ.

24:10.781 --> 24:12.047
God.

24:17.071 --> 24:18.070
How...

24:19.156 --> 24:21.090
Anybody want to sign for Jack's Law?

24:21.142 --> 24:23.008
Anybody?

24:23.010 --> 24:25.995
- Jack's Law?
- I'll sign.

24:27.965 --> 24:29.048
I... I, uh...

24:29.100 --> 24:31.016
You're not...

24:31.052 --> 24:32.952
I'm... I'm not...

24:32.987 --> 24:34.987
not supposed to see you.

24:35.022 --> 24:36.839
I won't tell if you won't.

24:58.713 --> 24:59.812
So, you know, I was thinking,

24:59.814 --> 25:01.730
and Berkeley isn't so bad.

25:01.782 --> 25:04.717
I mean, it's not ideal,
but it's not that far

25:04.752 --> 25:06.669
and they've got a really
good Robotics program,

25:06.721 --> 25:08.737
so I was thinking maybe
I could apply next year...

25:08.773 --> 25:12.041
I'm pretty sure Berkeley
doesn't have a Robotics program.

25:13.093 --> 25:14.977
Yes, it does. I... I looked it up.

25:15.029 --> 25:16.645
It's a really good one, in fact.

25:16.697 --> 25:19.131
Pretty sure Berklee College of Music

25:19.166 --> 25:21.016
doesn't have a Robotics program.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.954
Berklee College of Music? Where is that?

25:26.891 --> 25:28.040
Boston.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.845
Come on. We're up soon.

26:01.741 --> 26:03.090
Callie?

26:04.176 --> 26:07.027
So I called Justina
Marks. You know her, right?

26:07.113 --> 26:08.078
Yeah.

26:08.114 --> 26:09.163
Well, to tell her how well we were doing

26:09.198 --> 26:11.098
and how weird it was that there's this

26:11.133 --> 26:13.901
whole other group
collecting signatures here,

26:13.936 --> 26:16.920
and, well, she asked me to
pass along a little message.

26:16.922 --> 26:19.857
She told me to tell you
that opening people's mail

26:19.909 --> 26:20.991
is a federal offense.

26:22.828 --> 26:24.828
- I didn't...
- Well, she knows you posted

26:24.864 --> 26:27.731
a picture of the check
she got online, so...

26:27.783 --> 26:29.833
pack up, go home, and stop all this

26:29.885 --> 26:31.835
or she's gonna have you arrested.

26:43.115 --> 26:44.198
Hey.

26:44.250 --> 26:49.069
So, uh, listen, I handled
the whole Nick thing.

26:51.190 --> 26:52.756
What?

26:52.792 --> 26:54.091
What do you mean you handled it?

26:54.126 --> 26:55.125
What... what did you do?

26:55.127 --> 26:57.111
I... I went to see him, and, um...

26:57.146 --> 26:59.096
- You went to see him?
- Yeah, and we talked

26:59.131 --> 27:01.131
man to man, and I... I made it clear

27:01.167 --> 27:03.901
that you're not his girlfriend
anymore, that you're with Mat,

27:03.936 --> 27:05.035
and you don't ever
want to see him again.

27:05.070 --> 27:06.120
Oh, my god, why did you do that?

27:06.155 --> 27:08.005
You're so stupid!

27:08.040 --> 27:09.890
Now he's gonna be mad at me

27:09.925 --> 27:11.859
and I'm gonna have to... I...

27:11.894 --> 27:13.043
Mariana, it's... it's
okay. It's gonna be fine.

27:13.078 --> 27:14.928
- You're fine.
- You don't know that.

27:40.105 --> 27:41.188
Hey, what's going on?

27:42.741 --> 27:44.191
I can't do this. I...

27:44.226 --> 27:46.093
- Can't do what?
- Just any of it.

27:46.145 --> 27:47.144
I can't...

27:47.196 --> 27:50.030
keep trying to help people,

27:50.065 --> 27:52.966
and just have it blow up
in my face again. I can't.

27:54.019 --> 27:56.036
It's hard to help people sometimes.

27:56.088 --> 27:58.038
You know, it's hard
to do the right thing,

27:58.073 --> 27:59.940
and sometimes people get
hurt, sometimes you get hurt.

27:59.975 --> 28:01.024
But it's no excuse though.

28:01.076 --> 28:02.860
You gotta keep doing what you're doing.

28:02.895 --> 28:05.796
And you're doing a
great job, you hear me?

28:17.960 --> 28:20.811
Hey, can I go up with you guys?

28:20.813 --> 28:22.729
Um, on stage? Why?

28:43.035 --> 28:45.068
Captain Roberts, this
is Stefanie Adams-Foster.

28:45.070 --> 28:47.183
Um, I want to leave
this on your voicemail

28:47.184 --> 28:48.844
so that I don't change my mind.

28:49.008 --> 28:50.908
I'd like to see you on Monday.

28:50.943 --> 28:53.026
Something I'd like to take to IA.

29:09.102 --> 29:10.267
Hey, how's everyone doin'?

29:10.269 --> 29:14.038
Sorry, I... I know everyone's
here to see some music,

29:14.040 --> 29:16.474
and the amazing Someone's
Little Sister is about to play.

29:16.476 --> 29:18.075
Um...

29:18.077 --> 29:20.411
I just want to take
a few seconds to talk

29:20.463 --> 29:22.013
about my friend Jack Downey.

29:22.015 --> 29:25.366
He was let down by
the foster care system

29:25.401 --> 29:30.404
and died because of
abuse in an unsafe home.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.024
Uh, and I'm here today
because I want to make sure

29:33.059 --> 29:34.458
that his death was not in vain.

29:34.460 --> 29:38.312
See, there's two different
bills circulating today,

29:38.364 --> 29:41.332
and one of them is
sponsored by the people

29:41.367 --> 29:43.384
that are directly
responsible for Jack's death.

29:46.289 --> 29:50.174
So, I just... I'm asking you, please,

29:50.176 --> 29:52.326
please take one minute
from your day today

29:52.362 --> 29:56.180
to help us get Jack's Law
on the ballot this fall.

29:56.215 --> 29:58.149
Thank you.

30:00.319 --> 30:03.137
And now, Someone's Little Sister.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.093
Whoo!

30:11.464 --> 30:13.397
Thank you. We're
Someone's Little Sister.

30:13.449 --> 30:15.066
Uh, well, some of us are.

30:15.101 --> 30:17.468
Our keyboardist is actually
on a little vacation right now,

30:17.520 --> 30:20.488
so we asked our old friend,
Brandon Foster, to join us.

30:20.523 --> 30:23.040
And, uh, Brandon actually just
got some really exciting news.

30:23.092 --> 30:25.309
He will be attending
Juilliard this fall.

30:25.344 --> 30:27.445
I think he deserves a round
of applause for that, yeah?

30:33.403 --> 30:37.204
In honor of this most
momentous achievement,

30:37.256 --> 30:39.256
uh, we wanted to play a
song that he just wrote.

30:39.258 --> 30:40.341
It's called Collateral Damage.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.206
It's work.

30:57.160 --> 31:00.144
Hey, Monty, why are you
calling me on a Saturday?

31:00.179 --> 31:01.445
What's going on?

31:02.532 --> 31:04.415
Hey, uh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

31:04.417 --> 31:06.083
I'm gonna step away and call you back.

32:27.216 --> 32:28.265
He's here.

32:29.318 --> 32:30.317
Who? Who's here?

32:30.353 --> 32:31.318
Nick.

32:31.354 --> 32:32.369
Okay, where are you?

32:35.308 --> 32:36.307
- Um...
- Mariana.

32:40.112 --> 32:42.163
Uh, I'm... I'm by the bathroom.

32:45.101 --> 32:46.183
Mariana, what's going on?

32:46.185 --> 32:47.234
Mariana!

32:48.588 --> 32:49.503
I... I gotta...

32:52.124 --> 32:54.141
Hey, sorry about that.

32:54.193 --> 32:56.110
So what's going on?

33:08.474 --> 33:10.341
- Let me. I'll check inside.
- Okay.

33:16.365 --> 33:18.365
- Hello?
- Hey, are you here?

33:18.417 --> 33:20.050
- Are you at Bayfest?
- What?

33:20.052 --> 33:21.468
Listen, are you at Bayfest?

33:21.520 --> 33:23.304
Did you come here looking for Mariana?

33:23.356 --> 33:24.455
I have an ankle bracelet, dude.

33:24.490 --> 33:25.489
I can't leave.

33:25.491 --> 33:27.208
She's not in there.

33:27.260 --> 33:28.259
Then where the hell is she?

33:28.311 --> 33:29.393
Wait, what's going on?

33:29.395 --> 33:31.395
Hey, what's going on?

33:36.385 --> 33:39.270
I think that she might be
taking your pills again.

33:39.322 --> 33:42.206
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what do
you... what do you mean "again"?

34:01.160 --> 34:02.126
Hey.

34:02.128 --> 34:04.061
Have... have you seen Mariana?

34:04.096 --> 34:06.063
Uh, no, babe. Not for a while. Why?

34:06.065 --> 34:07.398
Because we can't find her anywhere.

34:07.450 --> 34:09.466
- And...
- And, um, she might

34:09.502 --> 34:11.051
have taken some of my pills.

34:11.103 --> 34:14.021
Look, I... I didn't
know anything about it,

34:14.072 --> 34:15.356
but I'm worried because she called me

34:15.408 --> 34:17.491
and she said that she... she
thinks she sees Nick here.

34:17.543 --> 34:20.360
N... Nick here? How
could he possibly be here?

34:26.452 --> 34:27.384
Hey.

34:29.272 --> 34:30.271
Hey.

34:32.375 --> 34:34.208
Listen, I'm sorry.

34:34.243 --> 34:36.310
I just...

34:36.344 --> 34:39.228
You should have told
me about Aaron before.

34:39.264 --> 34:41.364
I mean, I wouldn't
have gotten so jealous.

34:43.202 --> 34:45.351
Why? 'Cause he's trans?

34:45.388 --> 34:48.289
That's a very ignorant thing to say.

34:49.324 --> 34:50.291
What?

34:50.326 --> 34:53.226
Aaron is no less of a man than you are,

34:53.262 --> 34:56.063
and just 'cause he's trans, that
would never stop me from seeing him.

34:56.098 --> 34:59.133
Okay, so do you want to date him?

34:59.168 --> 35:00.217
No, that's not what I said.

35:00.252 --> 35:02.219
I mean that I would consider it

35:02.221 --> 35:03.187
if I weren't seeing you.

35:05.207 --> 35:07.041
Well, maybe you shouldn't be then.

35:07.076 --> 35:08.425
What?

35:08.477 --> 35:09.476
Seeing me.

35:16.052 --> 35:17.017
Uh...

35:26.395 --> 35:28.445
Hey, have you seen Mariana?

35:28.447 --> 35:30.247
No.

35:30.282 --> 35:31.382
Okay.

35:33.235 --> 35:34.318
Why were you in my house?

35:34.353 --> 35:36.253
Excuse me?

35:36.288 --> 35:38.339
Why were you in my house?

35:38.374 --> 35:40.257
Why are you watching me?

35:40.309 --> 35:42.142
I haven't. I...

35:42.178 --> 35:44.161
I'm not... I'm not.
I'm not watching you.

35:44.196 --> 35:45.245
I don't even know who you are.

35:45.281 --> 35:47.297
Don't lie to me because I saw you.

35:47.299 --> 35:50.134
- I'm not...
- I saw you. I know you're watching me.

35:50.169 --> 35:52.069
I'm not watching you. I
don't know who you are.

35:52.071 --> 35:53.203
- Don't lie to me.
- Okay, if you could just let me...

35:53.255 --> 35:55.139
What's going on here?

36:03.099 --> 36:05.983
- Hey. Have you... Anything?
- No. No, no, no.

36:06.035 --> 36:07.484
We've looked everywhere.
We've been all over this place.

36:07.486 --> 36:09.386
Okay. Uh...

36:11.090 --> 36:12.089
Okay, hold it right there.

36:13.392 --> 36:15.025
Excuse me, my name
is Stef Adams-Foster.

36:15.061 --> 36:17.077
I'm a police officer
with the sixth precinct.

36:17.113 --> 36:18.462
I have reason to believe
that my daughter is missing.

36:18.514 --> 36:21.014
- She is 5'2, she's Latina...
- Attention all officers,

36:21.050 --> 36:23.317
we have a BOLO for Nick Stratos.

36:23.352 --> 36:25.285
Be on the lookout for Nick Stratos.

36:25.337 --> 36:26.387
18, sandy brown hair.

36:26.422 --> 36:29.256
I repeat, we have a
BOLO for Nick Stratos.

36:29.308 --> 36:32.276
Parolee cut off his ankle
bracelet and is on the run.

36:32.278 --> 36:34.161
He's out on early parole.

36:39.248 --> 36:41.231
What?

36:41.283 --> 36:45.302
Uh, I just got a call.

36:45.337 --> 36:49.189
The, uh, the college board,

36:49.225 --> 36:52.159
they flagged that Tristan kid
when he took the SATs again

36:52.161 --> 36:54.261
and he scored so much lower.

36:54.296 --> 36:56.230
Uh, and?

36:58.067 --> 36:59.233
And, um...

37:03.139 --> 37:05.072
he told them... he told them everything,

37:05.107 --> 37:06.156
including your name.

37:11.514 --> 37:13.363
Uh...

37:13.415 --> 37:15.032
what does... what does that mean?

37:17.086 --> 37:18.469
It means you... you're
not going to Juilliard.

37:36.472 --> 37:38.238
Okay.

38:27.540 --> 38:29.506
Oh, hey.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.391
You all right?

38:31.427 --> 38:32.426
Uh, yeah.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.395
Hey, look, I'm sorry about before.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.331
It's, um...

38:37.366 --> 38:38.498
just been kind of hard.

38:40.302 --> 38:41.301
No, I understand.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.437
Actually, um...

38:43.439 --> 38:45.289
I think my sister's missing.

38:45.324 --> 38:48.208
Uh, she's Latina, uh, really short,

38:48.210 --> 38:50.210
um, she has a #justice4jack shirt on.

38:50.262 --> 38:51.245
Have you seen her?

38:51.280 --> 38:52.312
- Uh, dark hair?
- Yeah.

38:52.314 --> 38:53.447
- Pretty girl?
- Yeah.

38:53.482 --> 38:56.283
Yeah, I think I actually
did see her get into a car

38:56.285 --> 38:57.284
just a little bit ago.

38:57.286 --> 38:58.302
Um, do you want to...

39:00.222 --> 39:02.189
I mean, I think if we
hurry, we could probably...

39:02.241 --> 39:03.290
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

39:03.325 --> 39:04.291
Yeah, sure.

39:18.140 --> 39:20.107
Mariana, get in the car.

39:20.109 --> 39:21.108
Come on. Hey, it's okay.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.410
- Just get in the car.
- No, leave me alone!

39:23.462 --> 39:26.046
No, you can't. You...
you broke in to my house!

39:26.048 --> 39:27.481
- You had a gun!
- I know, I know, I'm sorry, okay?

39:27.516 --> 39:29.483
- Just please, please...
- No! You don't get to touch me!

39:31.086 --> 39:32.336
You hurt me! You scared me! You...

39:32.371 --> 39:34.454
- I know, I know just...
- You made me afraid in my own bedroom!

39:34.506 --> 39:36.056
You... you were gonna...

39:36.091 --> 39:37.391
No, I... I was never gonna hurt you!

39:37.426 --> 39:39.059
- You were gonna kill yourself!
- Please! I... I'm sorry!

39:39.061 --> 39:41.078
- Just come with me please!
- I don't love you, Nick!

39:41.113 --> 39:43.046
Stop! You don't get to do that!

39:43.082 --> 39:44.414
You don't get to do something like that

39:44.466 --> 39:45.465
and then just be with me!

39:45.501 --> 39:47.434
I never want to see you again!

39:50.322 --> 39:51.488
They couldn't have
gotten too much further.

39:57.429 --> 40:01.281
Hey, so, uh, I just
got a call from the JJC.

40:01.317 --> 40:02.399
They got the DNA report back.

40:02.451 --> 40:05.335
- And?
- And Harvey is not a match.

40:05.371 --> 40:07.892
- Oh.
- But there was more DNA

40:07.910 --> 40:11.224
on the murder weapon besides Kyle's.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.243
They can't ID it,

40:13.278 --> 40:15.663
but it's from someone related to Martha.

40:15.715 --> 40:16.764
A man.

40:22.221 --> 40:24.271
It's okay, Mariana.

40:24.273 --> 40:26.106
I'm okay.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.274
I understand that you don't want

40:27.276 --> 40:29.242
to see me anymore, and I understand why.

40:29.244 --> 40:31.294
I'm sorry I ever scared you like that.

40:37.407 --> 40:39.474
There! There! Stop the car!

40:39.509 --> 40:40.842
Stop it! Let me out!

40:42.212 --> 40:43.478
Hey!

40:43.513 --> 40:45.414
What did you do to her?

40:45.448 --> 40:46.915
Jesus! Whoa! Jesus...

40:46.950 --> 40:49.384
- Stop, stop, stop...
- Jesus, stop!

40:49.419 --> 40:50.686
Jesus!

40:50.720 --> 40:51.787
Stop...

40:54.490 --> 40:56.191
Jesus, stop, stop.

40:56.226 --> 40:57.292
Hey!

41:02.398 --> 41:03.832
Oh, my god! Jesus!

41:03.866 --> 41:05.167
Jesus, honey, can you hear me?

41:05.201 --> 41:07.970
Call 911. What did you do?!

41:08.004 --> 41:10.439
Buddy, baby, are you okay?

41:10.473 --> 41:11.974
Jesus, talk to me, honey.

41:12.008 --> 41:13.308
Jesus...

41:16.318 --> 41:19.893

fest?
- What?

33:20.052 --> 33:21.468
Listen, are you at Bayfest?

33:21.520 --> 33:23.304
Did you come here looking for Mariana?

33:23.356 --> 33:24.455
I have an ankle bracelet, dude.

33:24.490 --> 33:25.489
I can't leave.

33:25.491 --> 33:27.208
She's not in there.

33:27.260 --> 33:28.259
Then where the hell is she?

33:28.311 --> 33:29.393
Wait, what's going on?

33:29.395 --> 33:31.395
Hey, what's going on?

33:36.385 --> 33:39.270
I think that she might be
taking your pills again.

33:39.322 --> 33:42.206
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what do
you... what do you mean "again"?

34:01.160 --> 34:02.126
Hey.

34:02.128 --> 34:04.061
Have... have you seen Mariana?

34:04.096 --> 34:06.063
Uh, no, babe. Not for a while. Why?

34:06.065 --> 34:07.398
Because we can't find her anywhere.

34:07.450 --> 34:09.466
- And...
- And, um, she might

34:09.502 --> 34:11.051
have taken some of my pills.

34:11.103 --> 34:14.021
Look, I... I didn't
know anything about it,

34:14.072 --> 34:15.356
but I'm worried because she called me

34:15.408 --> 34:17.491
and she said that she... she
thinks she sees Nick here.

34:17.543 --> 34:20.360
N... Nick here? How
could he possibly be here?

34:26.452 --> 34:27.384
Hey.

34:29.272 --> 34:30.271
Hey.

34:32.375 --> 34:34.208
Listen, I'm sorry.

34:34.243 --> 34:36.310
I just...

34:36.344 --> 34:39.228
You should have told
me about Aaron before.

34:39.264 --> 34:41.364
I mean, I wouldn't
have gotten so jealous.

34:43.202 --> 34:45.351
Why? 'Cause he's trans?

34:45.388 --> 34:48.289
That's a very ignorant thing to say.

34:49.324 --> 34:50.291
What?

34:50.326 --> 34:53.226
Aaron is no less of a man than you are,

34:53.262 --> 34:56.063
and just 'cause he's trans, that
would never stop me from seeing him.

34:56.098 --> 34:59.133
Okay, so do you want to date him?

34:59.168 --> 35:00.217
No, that's not what I said.

35:00.252 --> 35:02.219
I mean that I would consider it

35:02.221 --> 35:03.187
if I weren't seeing you.

35:05.207 --> 35:07.041
Well, maybe you shouldn't be then.

35:07.076 --> 35:08.425
What?

35:08.477 --> 35:09.476
Seeing me.

35:16.052 --> 35:17.017
Uh...

35:26.395 --> 35:28.445
Hey, have you seen Mariana?

35:28.447 --> 35:30.247
No.

35:30.282 --> 35:31.382
Okay.

35:33.235 --> 35:34.318
Why were you in my house?

35:34.353 --> 35:36.253
Excuse me?

35:36.288 --> 35:38.339
Why were you in my house?

35:38.374 --> 35:40.257
Why are you watching me?

35:40.309 --> 35:42.142
I haven't. I...

35:42.178 --> 35:44.161
I'm not... I'm not.
I'm not watching you.

35:44.196 --> 35:45.245
I don't even know who you are.

35:45.281 --> 35:47.297
Don't lie to me because I saw you.

35:47.299 --> 35:50.134
- I'm not...
- I saw you. I know you're watching me.

35:50.169 --> 35:52.069
I'm not watching you. I
don't know who you are.

35:52.071 --> 35:53.203
- Don't lie to me.
- Okay, if you could just let me...
