WEBVTT

01:17.536 --> 01:19.871
- Easy.
- You want it easy, quit moaning.

01:19.955 --> 01:24.250
- I got to change these bandages.
- Try not taking my skin off with them.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.879
How'd I score
the house call, Dr. Quinn?

01:27.963 --> 01:31.257
- Trying to ease your conscience?
- My conscience is fine.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.469
What have you got
to feel guilty about?

01:34.553 --> 01:37.597
I mean, you just let that
damn Arab torture me.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.600
Stood by and watched.
Now you figure you'll patch me up

01:40.684 --> 01:44.520
and buy you a ticket into heaven?
Only reason you're here...

01:44.605 --> 01:48.232
I'm here because no one else
wants anything to do with you.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.323
She does.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.371
Change your own bandages.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.054
Looking for someone,
or just admiring the view?

02:19.056 --> 02:21.390
It's been two days
since Sayid took off.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.477
I keep thinking
I'm gonna see him.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.063
He'll come when he's
found what he's looking for,

02:27.147 --> 02:30.316
- the French transmission.
- He wasn't looking for anything.

02:31.109 --> 02:34.403
- He left because of what happened.
- It was an accident.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.615
Well, accidents happen when
you torture people, Jack.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.120
Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.206
He can take care of himself.

04:22.679 --> 04:27.683
Hello?

04:51.166 --> 04:54.001
Get him out of there!
He's drinking our water.

04:54.086 --> 04:58.714
- What's going on out there?
- You know, the usual.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.466
People yelling at each other.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.469
Doc, what do you think this is, this...

05:03.553 --> 05:05.262
...this rash?
It's bad, right?

05:05.347 --> 05:07.932
- Some kind of a tropical disease?
- It's hives.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.059
What's that?
Is that like poison ivy?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.519
It's a common rash,

05:11.603 --> 05:14.981
sometimes brought on
by heat and stress.

05:15.065 --> 05:18.150
- Just try to relax. It'll clear up.
- Right.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.194
- Try to keep your mind off it.
- OK.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.155
What is that?
Is that like aloe?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.658
Isn't that for sunburn
or something?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.827
"Try to keep your mind off it"?

05:27.911 --> 05:30.746
What else has that guy
got to do but stress?

05:30.831 --> 05:34.000
I have enough without having
to treat hypochondriacs.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.835
That's like my point, man.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.586
We're all fried.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.674
I mean, have you taken
a look at everybody out there?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.760
Everybody's way tense.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.430
Dude, I'm just saying,
it'd be sweet

05:47.514 --> 05:49.974
if we could have...

05:50.058 --> 05:52.643
I don't know,
something to do.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.770
We're surviving here, Hurley.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.690
And that's my main concern,
is keeping us alive.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.360
Things could be worse.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.489
How?

06:22.799 --> 06:36.979
Where is Alex?

06:44.780 --> 06:47.323
- What?
- Where is Alex?

06:48.325 --> 06:49.784
Who are you?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.912
Where is Alex?

06:53.705 --> 06:56.373
I don't know
what you are talking about.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.341
Where is Alex?

07:09.262 --> 07:12.098
- Please, let's not...
- Where is Alex?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.849
I don't know any Alex.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.354
Stop!

07:52.889 --> 07:55.266
And all the pain will stop.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.521
Your Shiite friends have already
implicated you in the bombing.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.318
You planted the device
in the headquarters.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.321
You killed two soldiers!

08:10.365 --> 08:13.701
Confess it, and perhaps
it will only cost you your hands

08:13.785 --> 08:15.870
instead of your life.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.795
He doesn't know anything.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.673
- Your sources were wrong.
- Perhaps.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.302
But that's really not the point, is it?

08:31.386 --> 08:34.889
- You handled yourself well in there.
- Did I?

08:34.972 --> 08:38.183
I put in for your reassignment
to intelligence division,

08:38.268 --> 08:41.562
- if you still wish it.
- Yes, sir. Very much so.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.441
Good. But stop calling me "sir"
when it's just the two of us.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.861
You're my superior officer, Omar.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.154
For now.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.781
And I'll enjoy it while it lasts.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.200
That reminds me,

08:54.284 --> 08:57.828
in addition to your
increased responsibilities,

08:57.913 --> 09:00.372
a promotion is commensurate
with your move.

09:00.457 --> 09:04.210
That is, if you won't miss
being a communications officer.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.297
- I am willing to make that sacrifice.
- Good.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.059
- Hi.
- Yo.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.979
- What's this?
- They must have fallen from the plane.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.649
What are you doing
in the jungle at night?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.610
- Best time to hunt.
- Ethan here has some experience.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.072
He spotted tracks that might be
a rabbit or some other rodent.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.990
Rodent. Yum.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.243
People are getting tired
of boar meat.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.578
You got that right.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.083
All right, well,
I'll take a look at these,

09:44.167 --> 09:46.502
- see if there's anything useful.
- OK.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.397
Mr. Locke.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.524
Are you going
back out to hunt?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.150
- For a bit.
- Can I go with you?

10:10.235 --> 10:13.279
I mean, I just want to learn
how to do what you do.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.574
I was just talking to Mr. Locke about...

10:17.659 --> 10:21.537
I know what you're doing.
Not gonna happen. Get back to bed.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.170
Dude...

10:38.388 --> 10:41.223
Please just listen to me!

10:41.808 --> 10:45.561
I keep telling you
I don't know who Alex is!

10:46.187 --> 10:48.105
I'm a survivor
of a plane crash.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.984
I found the wire on the beach.
I followed it.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.946
I thought it might have
something to do with

10:56.031 --> 10:58.824
a transmission
we picked up on a receiver.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.660
A recording, a mayday

11:01.745 --> 11:06.248
with a Frenchwoman
repeating on a loop for 16 years.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.228
16 years.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.690
Has it really been that long?

11:31.775 --> 11:34.526
You.

11:35.195 --> 11:39.740
You just happened
to hear my distress call?

11:40.492 --> 11:42.451
I know what you are.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.063
Rousseau.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.735
- How do you know my name?
- I read it.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.822
There, on the jacket.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.158
What is this place?

12:25.537 --> 12:28.539
Those batteries wouldn't be able
to produce enough power

12:28.623 --> 12:31.375
to transmit your distress call
all these years.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.836
Broadcasts from somewhere else.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.047
But they control it now.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.800
They?

12:40.677 --> 12:43.345
You.
And the others like you.

12:46.057 --> 12:49.935
I don't know who you think I am.
I've already told you. I am not...

12:50.019 --> 12:51.186
Sayid?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.108
- How...
- My name was on a jacket.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.862
Yours is on the envelope you carry.
Who is she?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.953
The woman
in the photographs.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.708
Nadia.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.128
Her name is Nadia.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.466
We cannot tie Noor Abed Jazeem
directly to the bombing,

13:20.550 --> 13:22.301
but we know her sympathies.

13:22.385 --> 13:26.513
She's a known associate
of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.682
She knows who orchestrated
the bombing?

13:28.766 --> 13:31.768
That, my friend,
is exactly what you will find out.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.987
Noor Abed Jazeem.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.823
I'm going to ask you
some questions.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.826
If you refuse to cooperate,
I'm going to hurt you.

13:47.911 --> 13:51.079
Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.249
You of all people
should know that.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.586
What?

14:00.757 --> 14:03.675
You don't remember me?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.304
Am I so different from the girl
in the schoolyard

14:07.388 --> 14:09.765
who used to push you in the mud?

14:11.935 --> 14:15.187
- Nadia.
- And your mother would tell my mother,

14:15.271 --> 14:19.024
"Why must you pick on
little Sayid?"

14:19.108 --> 14:20.901
And I'd answer,

14:20.985 --> 14:23.737
"Because he ignores me."

14:24.364 --> 14:27.449
You had enough attention,

14:27.534 --> 14:31.203
with your family's wealth and...
your charm.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.706
Such things matter little to children.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.876
But then, you always were
older than your years,

14:37.961 --> 14:40.462
weren't you, Sayid?

14:41.297 --> 14:43.840
Not old enough to understand
that being pushed

14:43.925 --> 14:46.343
was a sign of affection.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.640
Now you're a traitor
to your country.

14:55.478 --> 14:59.022
Tell me what you know
about the bombing, Nadia.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.860
Tell me, or I swear
I will hurt you.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.905
Oh, I know, Sayid.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.659
This is not my first interrogation
by the Republican Guard.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.579
This is where they burned me
with acid.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.748
They pierced my hands
with a drill.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.959
Would you like to see
the soles of my feet?

15:19.043 --> 15:21.461
Where they flayed
the skin off?

15:23.089 --> 15:26.550
These are handiworks
of your friends.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.304
The people you swear
allegiance to.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.682
If you were innocent,
I'm sorry.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.227
But this bombing
is a different matter.

15:39.147 --> 15:42.107
- Nadia...
- Go on, Sayid.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.610
Do your work.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.863
I'm not going to
tell you anything.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.199
Then I'm going to hurt you.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.785
I know.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.706
You have a bullet wound.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.709
I was a soldier.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.837
You were?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.339
And are you still?

16:06.549 --> 16:09.301
It was a long time ago.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.354
Tell me more about her,
the woman. Nadia.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.734
Alex... who is he?

16:31.741 --> 16:35.077
I'm bored. Can I take Vincent
to the beach?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.289
Later.
I'm in the middle of something.

16:39.374 --> 16:40.832
But there's nothing to do.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.001
Well, you got to figure out
stuff to do.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.671
You got to find a way
to entertain yourself.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.506
Come on.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.175
Come on. I know I saw it.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.761
Yes.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.473
- Hurley...
- Hold on, man. I'm busy.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.018
- Can I borrow this?
- What?

17:00.103 --> 17:02.771
- Thanks, man.
- What are you doing?

17:08.486 --> 17:11.029
So you heard my transmission,

17:11.114 --> 17:14.281
- came looking for me, for answers.
- I didn't know you were alive.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.661
- Still lying.
- I'm not lying.

17:17.744 --> 17:21.455
Lies! Like this plane crash
that you survived.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.541
- There were others?
- More than 40.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.502
Then why are you alone?

17:26.337 --> 17:29.673
- I left them.
- Why?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.801
There was...

17:35.138 --> 17:37.139
I did something.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.144
Something I'm ashamed of.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.605
And Nadia...

17:47.859 --> 17:49.651
...you left her, too?

17:50.153 --> 17:52.988
She wasn't on the plane.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.243
She's dead.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.416
Because of me.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.554
I'm so sorry.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.031
I want to show you something.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.202
See, this junction here

18:40.286 --> 18:44.080
reroutes some of the spring's water flow
into suspended basins.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.458
Pop in some holes,
you got showers.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.919
You keep the drinking water separate.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.254
This is...
You drew this?

18:52.048 --> 18:55.759
- I was an artist in a previous life.
- I thought you were in construction.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.221
- I am. I mean I was. Long story.
- Hey, Jack!

18:59.305 --> 19:02.724
Hurley's worked up about something.
Said we should see it.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.979
Welcome...

19:09.565 --> 19:11.983
...to the first and...

19:12.068 --> 19:14.277
...hopefully last,

19:14.362 --> 19:15.737
Island Open.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.033
- What?
- It's two holes, for now.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.994
Three par, and no waiting.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.164
You built a golf course?

19:26.249 --> 19:29.751
Rich idiots fly to tropical islands
to whack balls around.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.170
All the stuff we got
to deal with, man,

19:32.255 --> 19:34.422
this is what you've been
wasting time on?

19:34.507 --> 19:37.342
Dudes, listen.
Our lives suck.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.678
Nerves are stretched to the max.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.764
I mean, we're lost
on an island,

19:42.849 --> 19:46.476
running from boars
and monsters...

19:46.561 --> 19:49.479
- Freakin' polar bears!
- Polar bears?

19:49.564 --> 19:51.523
You didn't hear about the polar bear?

19:51.607 --> 19:55.527
If we're stuck here, then just
surviving's not gonna cut it.

19:55.611 --> 19:59.114
We need some kind of relief.
We need some way that we can...

20:00.366 --> 20:03.910
...you know, have fun.
That's right, fun.

20:03.995 --> 20:07.414
Or we're gonna go crazy, waiting
for the next bad thing to happen.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.257
It's a music box,
but it's broken.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.968
Has been...

20:20.970 --> 20:22.637
...for a long time.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.181
It was a gift from my love

20:25.266 --> 20:26.933
for our anniversary.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.019
You mean Alex.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.062
Robert.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.693
It was such a comfort to me
the first few years here.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.406
I could fix it for you.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.785
I could take a look at it
if you freed my hands.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.876
I'm fairly good
with mechanical things.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.963
I'll need my hands.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.182
What is written on the back
of your photograph?

21:07.266 --> 21:11.102
- What are you doing?
- Did she write it, or did you?

21:14.106 --> 21:17.859
Perhaps you don't want to tell me
because it causes too much pain.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.742
Rousseau...

21:27.787 --> 21:29.579
You don't need to do that.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.965
- This is a problem, man.
- Yeah.

21:40.049 --> 21:43.635
I mean, I know what I'd do, but...

21:44.887 --> 21:47.013
...it's gotta be your call.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.144
OK.

21:53.229 --> 21:56.064
- Give me a 7 iron.
- Got it.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.738
Heads up over there!

22:04.156 --> 22:06.074
- No chance!
- Don't blow it!

22:06.158 --> 22:08.576
You won't get
anywhere near us!

22:11.038 --> 22:12.664
Hey! Doc!

22:12.748 --> 22:14.165
There you are.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.334
Somebody said
you went this way.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.713
Listen, that rash of mine
is starting to spread.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.007
It's like the size of a grape...

22:22.091 --> 22:24.426
What are you guys doing?

22:25.636 --> 22:27.595
Are you playing golf?

22:29.056 --> 22:30.140
Yeah.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.476
Can I play?

22:46.615 --> 22:49.159
Sorry about the sedative.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.454
It was the only safe way
for me to move you.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.917
You offered to fix
my music box.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.461
After all I've done to you.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.172
Striking you, shocking you.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.007
Why?

23:10.306 --> 23:13.224
Do you want me to fix
your music box, or don't you?

23:15.811 --> 23:18.897
Yes.
Yes, please.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.609
Then I want to know
your name.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.612
Your first name.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.365
Danielle.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.284
My name is Danielle.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.459
And how did you come to be
on this island, Danielle?

23:51.847 --> 23:54.182
We were part
of a science team.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.893
A science team
armed with rifles.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.148
- Was Robert on the team?
- Yes.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.942
And Alex, was he, too?

24:04.026 --> 24:07.112
Our vessel was three days
out of Tahiti

24:07.196 --> 24:09.531
when our instruments malfunctioned.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.784
It was night.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.203
The storm...

24:16.163 --> 24:18.206
The sounds...

24:20.126 --> 24:22.335
The ship slammed into rocks,

24:22.419 --> 24:23.837
ran aground,

24:23.921 --> 24:26.381
the hull breached
beyond repair.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.050
So...

24:30.052 --> 24:31.469
...we made camp.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.389
Dug out this temporary shelter.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.935
Temporary.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.898
Nearly two months
we survived here.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.110
Two months before...

24:47.194 --> 24:51.156
Your distress signal.
The message I heard.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.367
You said "It killed them all."

25:04.628 --> 25:07.338
We were coming back
from the black rock.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.343
It was them.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.306
They were the carriers.

25:16.390 --> 25:19.475
Who were the carriers?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.644
The others.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.023
What others?

25:25.107 --> 25:27.442
What is the black rock?

25:28.736 --> 25:31.321
Have you seen other people
on this island?

25:31.405 --> 25:32.906
No.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.866
But I hear them.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.286
Out there in the jungle.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.789
They whisper.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.010
You think I'm insane.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.309
I think you've been alone for too long.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.205
I'm sorry.
This is all I could find.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.541
I'll try and bring you
some fruit later on.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.336
Are you ready to talk?

26:28.420 --> 26:32.674
That depends on what you'd like
to talk about, Sayid.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.760
Books?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.053
Weather?

26:37.137 --> 26:40.056
Since I've seen neither
locked in this cell for weeks,

26:40.140 --> 26:42.558
I'm afraid my conversation
will suffer.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.061
We have two suspects
in custody.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.272
Have a look at these photographs.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.899
All you need to do is nod.

26:49.984 --> 26:52.944
If you prove you're willing
to cooperate,

26:53.028 --> 26:55.196
I think I can get them
to free you.

27:01.537 --> 27:05.206
Then I won't have these visits
to look forward to anymore.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.669
This isn't a game, Nadia.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.839
Yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

27:13.716 --> 27:17.635
Pretending to be something
I know you're not.

27:26.895 --> 27:30.273
- You'll never believe this.
- You learned how to tie your shoes?

27:30.357 --> 27:33.443
Funny. Someone at the caves
built a golf course.

27:33.527 --> 27:36.279
- Are you high?
- Seriously, a golf course.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.072
Jack's playing right now.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.324
Jack?

27:40.993 --> 27:43.244
- Is golfing?
- That's what I hear.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.041
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna check this out.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.876
Wait for me, bonehead.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.843
Doctor playing golf.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.471
Boy howdy,
now I've heard everything.

28:01.555 --> 28:06.184
- What's next, cop eating a donut?
- If you want to come, you should say.

28:06.268 --> 28:09.854
Think I'll pass on that, Freckles.
Not big on crowds.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.857
And let's face it,
crowd's not too hot on me, either.

28:16.278 --> 28:20.490
One outcast to another, I'd think about
making more of an effort.

28:23.786 --> 28:26.120
Duly noted.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.586
You see?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.842
Some things can be fixed.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.684
Thank you.

28:49.645 --> 28:58.653
Thank you so much.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.780
Danielle,

29:00.864 --> 29:03.157
please let me go.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.538
Go?

29:08.622 --> 29:11.374
Back to the people
I told you about.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.545
You can't.
You have to stay.

29:15.629 --> 29:18.381
- It's not safe.
- Not safe? What's not safe?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.258
You need me.
You can't leave.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.676
Danielle.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.434
Where are you going?

29:29.518 --> 29:32.979
- If we're lucky, it's one of the bears.
- If we're lucky?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.823
It might be that thing out there.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.702
The monster.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.204
There's no such thing
as monsters.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.131
- You have to execute her.
- What?

30:00.215 --> 30:02.258
The Jazeem woman
has given us nothing.

30:02.342 --> 30:05.052
This will send a message
to others who will not talk.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.804
I just need more time with her.

30:06.889 --> 30:09.474
You have had more
than a month, Sayid.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.477
Now bring her outside
and shoot her,

30:12.561 --> 30:14.520
or I will.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.608
Is this a problem?

30:19.693 --> 30:20.818
No.

30:20.903 --> 30:24.071
- It's not a problem.
- Good.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.876
What did you bring me today?

30:42.925 --> 30:44.800
Put it on.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.971
Are you going
to hurt me, Sayid?

31:36.812 --> 31:40.147
- Dude, I think you stuck it.
- Lucky, lucky.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.316
This thing have
a ladies' team?

31:42.818 --> 31:44.527
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.862
- When'd you show up?
- While ago.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.074
I almost didn't recognize you.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.368
You're smiling.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.287
I have to watch that.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.248
So, how'd you come up with this?

31:57.332 --> 31:59.208
Wasn't me.
It was all Hurley.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.587
I've been going crazy
to make everyone feel safe.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.715
I haven't been sleeping
'cause I want everyone to feel safe.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.592
He builds a golf course,

32:07.676 --> 32:11.262
- and everyone feels safe.
- Crap! Do-over.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.723
It's a Mulligan.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.851
It's a gentleman's sport.
You got to get the words right.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.603
- Dad.
- Check this out.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.063
- You want to...
- Let me.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.565
- Get away!
- All right.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.275
You left me alone
at the caves.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.110
What?
I left you with Claire.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.486
She's sleeping.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.697
Oh, man,
I'm... I'm sorry.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.991
I just...
I just got caught up.

32:32.075 --> 32:35.411
I'm really sorry, Walt.
I screwed up.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.663
I'll make it up to you.
You wanna play?

32:40.083 --> 32:43.085
You're breathing out.
When you go up...

32:43.170 --> 32:44.920
There's other people waiting.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.548
They won't mind.
You want to take a swing?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.342
Michael, it's your shot.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.887
OK, cool.
So we'll play later, OK?

33:23.585 --> 33:25.419
Put the gun down, Danielle.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.756
Put it down on the ground.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.596
Don't.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.450
I'll take it from here.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.047
What... what's going on?

34:10.132 --> 34:13.007
Forty meters outside this door,
there's a supply truck

34:13.092 --> 34:16.053
that will be leaving.
They don't check them on the way out.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.723
Only coming in.
Get inside.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.641
Cover yourself any way you can.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.895
They won't reach the city for
30 minutes. That's enough time to hide.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.732
Come with me.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.817
I can't.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.485
Desertion.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.905
They would kill my family.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.784
I don't have your courage.

34:38.869 --> 34:41.370
You have more than you know.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.042
Nadia, you have to go.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.712
Sayid?

34:52.507 --> 34:54.091
What are you doing?

34:59.181 --> 35:00.514
Don't.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.894
Guard!

35:08.273 --> 35:11.776
Sayid! You have to come with me!
They'll kill you!

35:11.860 --> 35:14.862
No. You escaped, you stole my gun,
and you shot him.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.032
And then you shot me.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.330
Sayid!

35:29.961 --> 35:31.754
Take it.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.340
Please, Nadia.

35:34.925 --> 35:37.343
Take it and go.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.615
Please, I don't wish
to hurt you.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.743
You already have.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.912
Don't.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.590
The firing pin
has been removed.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.218
Robert didn't notice
it was missing, either,

36:20.262 --> 36:21.971
when I shot him.

36:23.265 --> 36:26.225
- But you loved him.
- He was sick.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.601
Sick?

36:29.479 --> 36:30.980
It took them...

36:31.064 --> 36:33.566
...one after the other.

36:34.276 --> 36:36.735
I had no choice.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.613
They were already lost.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.868
- You killed them.
- What would have happened

36:43.952 --> 36:46.328
if we were rescued?

36:46.413 --> 36:48.873
I couldn't let that happen.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.499
I won't!

36:51.209 --> 36:52.960
I'm not sick.

36:53.503 --> 36:55.421
I know.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.549
Then why kill me?

37:01.344 --> 37:04.763
I can't let you go.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.225
Don't you understand?

37:08.310 --> 37:11.854
To have someone to talk to...

37:12.647 --> 37:14.231
...to touch.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.322
"You'll find me in the next life,

37:21.406 --> 37:23.365
if not in this one."

37:25.160 --> 37:26.118
What?

37:26.202 --> 37:29.246
The writing on the back
of Nadia's photograph.

37:31.041 --> 37:34.168
I know what it's like
to hold on to someone.

37:36.463 --> 37:41.133
I've been holding on for seven years
to just a thought.

37:41.217 --> 37:45.471
A blind hope that somewhere
she's still alive.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.851
But the more I hold on,

37:51.853 --> 37:54.188
the more I pull away
from those around me.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.194
The only way off this...

38:00.820 --> 38:04.740
...this place,
is with their help.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.512
Come with me.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.267
You don't have to be
alone, Danielle.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.624
Your people,

38:55.709 --> 38:58.585
the ones you're determined
to get back to.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.421
Watch them.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.800
Watch them closely.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.898
Who is Alex?

39:23.737 --> 39:26.488
Alex was my child.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.800
Guys, please.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.179
I've never made par
on a course before.

39:53.475 --> 39:56.518
- No!
- Dude, you were robbed.

39:56.603 --> 39:58.604
Bollocks! See that?

39:59.189 --> 40:01.315
OK, Jack, it's up to you.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.233
Sink this, you get the blazer.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.902
No pressure.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.987
Yeah, no pressure.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.497
Five bucks says he sinks it.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.334
- You betting against me?
- Sorry, dude,

40:20.418 --> 40:22.795
- but you're a duffer like me.
- Make it ten.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.881
I don't have any cash,
but I'll bet my dinner on the doc.

40:27.175 --> 40:31.345
I got two tubes of sunscreen
and a flashlight says he chokes.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.023
I'll take that action.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.695
Yeah, me too.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.489
You just bet on Jack, dumb-ass.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.366
We need the sunscreen, princess.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.395
Does your father
know you're here?

41:27.277 --> 41:29.278
Can you teach me how to do that?
