WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:02.971
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:02.972 --> 00:04.973
This shit is military-grade.

00:04.974 --> 00:06.814
We killed a fuckin' gunrunner.

00:06.816 --> 00:10.699
50 down, 100 on delivery.
125 on delivery.

00:11.981 --> 00:14.142
Scoot over.

00:14.143 --> 00:15.343
Who you textin'?

00:15.344 --> 00:16.825
Friend from school.

00:19.509 --> 00:23.792
Li'I Tony is not yet of age
to contribute to the household.

00:23.793 --> 00:25.594
You want the Council to restore Fonso?

00:25.595 --> 00:29.678
We want a kris to take this
request into consideration.

00:29.679 --> 00:30.759
Mm-hmm.

00:37.166 --> 00:39.287
My visions, they're gone!

00:39.288 --> 00:40.448
I haven't had one in a month.

00:40.449 --> 00:41.610
I didn't pursue you

00:41.611 --> 00:43.692
because you can see things.

00:43.693 --> 00:46.134
I pursued you because you have talent.

00:46.135 --> 00:48.817
And I'm in on the con.
Second row to your right.

00:48.818 --> 00:50.659
Car accident. She was driving.

00:50.660 --> 00:53.542
She may have lost her son.

00:53.543 --> 00:55.544
How far along were you?

00:55.545 --> 00:57.786
Five months.

00:57.787 --> 00:59.387
Oh, damn!

01:13.362 --> 01:16.085
Mm.

01:40.069 --> 01:42.310
What are you doing?!

01:42.311 --> 01:44.873
I was just getting in
a few licks before sunrise.

01:44.874 --> 01:47.435
Where'd this come from?
Sports Authority.

01:47.436 --> 01:50.358
I mean...
Just part of my new regimen.

01:50.359 --> 01:53.241
For your new venture?
For just my general wellbeing.

01:56.646 --> 01:58.366
Okay.
Honey, I know.

01:58.367 --> 02:02.210
You might be worried about
Maggie's influence, but...

02:02.211 --> 02:05.013
I'm not. You just seem so...

02:05.014 --> 02:07.277
different all of a sudden.

02:08.898 --> 02:10.497
Different how?

02:10.822 --> 02:13.742
You don't seem like you.

02:13.743 --> 02:15.452
Maybe it's the new me.

02:16.506 --> 02:18.497
New and improved.

02:19.789 --> 02:21.750
Maybe it's not you at all.

02:21.751 --> 02:24.392
People can change, honey.

02:24.393 --> 02:26.194
You don't have to be threatened by it.

02:26.195 --> 02:27.286
I'm not.

02:29.741 --> 02:31.359
I need to meditate.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.042
Oh. Sorry.

02:34.043 --> 02:35.684
For your new regimen?

02:35.685 --> 02:36.845
Yes. Yeah.

02:36.846 --> 02:38.166
There's coffee in the kitchen.

02:38.167 --> 02:39.393
Ah.

02:40.449 --> 02:43.732
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh.

03:07.076 --> 03:10.358
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

03:10.359 --> 03:12.521
ahhhhhhhhhh

03:12.522 --> 03:16.444
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

03:16.445 --> 03:19.568
ooooooooooooom.

03:44.073 --> 03:47.636
Oh. Sorry, sorry. Did I wake you?

03:47.637 --> 03:50.198
No. Bad dream.

03:50.199 --> 03:52.000
I can stop if you want.

03:52.001 --> 03:54.083
Knock yourself out.
Okay.

04:53.262 --> 04:55.263
Tickets, tickets.

04:55.264 --> 04:57.826
Has anyone seen my boarding pass?

04:57.827 --> 04:59.749
Uh, the printer.
No, it's not there.

05:02.512 --> 05:05.273
Hey. Gotta eat your breakfast.
You're gonna be late.

05:05.274 --> 05:07.516
I'm done.
I don't think so.

05:07.517 --> 05:09.037
Eat something.
I'm done. Let's go.

05:09.038 --> 05:11.319
Gotta over some stuff
with your dad first.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.281
What is this tomorrow at 3:00?

05:13.282 --> 05:15.424
Uh, interview. Dowser.

05:16.726 --> 05:18.887
Uses a divining rod to find water.

05:18.888 --> 05:21.530
I know what a dowser is.
Why do you need one?

05:21.531 --> 05:22.971
Did you forget to pay the water bill?

05:22.972 --> 05:24.973
I think he might be
a new source of revenue.

05:24.974 --> 05:26.454
We're in the middle of a drought.

05:26.455 --> 05:27.856
Drought's over, Dad.

05:27.857 --> 05:29.538
That's what the fake news says.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.525
Please.
Oh, where are these tickets?

05:34.984 --> 05:37.154
In your back pocket?

05:38.347 --> 05:40.073
Oh.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.390
Don't be nervous.
I'm not.

05:42.391 --> 05:43.827
Don't lie to me.

05:44.433 --> 05:45.714
You're gonna kick it in the ass.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.397
I want you to.

05:49.398 --> 05:50.478
Thanks.

05:50.479 --> 05:51.601
Mom!

05:58.808 --> 06:00.929
Morning.
Morning! We're late.

06:00.930 --> 06:03.812
So are we.
Hey, where's my kiss?

06:05.735 --> 06:07.495
Safe flight, honey.
Nick.

06:07.496 --> 06:08.897
What?
Be good.

06:08.898 --> 06:10.018
Bye.

06:10.019 --> 06:11.540
So, this is what an all-American,

06:11.541 --> 06:14.102
happy family looks like?

06:14.103 --> 06:15.785
All-American, happy-ish.

06:23.658 --> 06:25.834
Hey, don't be so nervous.

06:25.835 --> 06:27.537
It's gonna go fine.

06:28.758 --> 06:30.790
Huh?
Look at you.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.251
You got this.

06:35.170 --> 06:37.245
You want something to worry about,

06:37.246 --> 06:39.048
worry about our upcoming transaction.

06:41.450 --> 06:42.731
You mean...?
Yeah.

06:42.732 --> 06:45.093
Pssh!
We have to load up tonight.

06:45.094 --> 06:46.348
Tonight?

06:47.176 --> 06:49.257
I thought that wasn't
until the end of the week.

06:49.258 --> 06:50.939
I can't load up tomorrow.

06:51.228 --> 06:52.902
Mateo is in a school play.

06:56.265 --> 06:57.275
Okay.

06:58.748 --> 07:00.153
Oh, come on.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.390
Shit.

07:02.391 --> 07:03.552
You better get outta here.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.074
All right. Hey, good luck.

07:15.805 --> 07:18.129
Welcome. Big Jim!

07:22.692 --> 07:25.974
Sorry. Josip.

07:25.975 --> 07:27.576
This is it.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.017
Great, isn't it?

07:29.018 --> 07:30.458
Huh?

07:30.459 --> 07:34.938
We got everything. Mini-mart, dojo.

07:36.225 --> 07:38.066
Sports bar.

07:39.549 --> 07:40.869
Pawn shop.

07:40.870 --> 07:43.912
Pawn shop's closed temporarily.

07:43.913 --> 07:45.473
Latin Tax. Whatever you can...

07:45.474 --> 07:48.493
I understand you have
a psychic call center.

07:49.238 --> 07:50.829
Right this way.

07:53.723 --> 07:57.165
That's impressive.
Thanks.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.128
Oh.

07:59.168 --> 08:00.297
Cigar?

08:03.372 --> 08:04.843
Shitty cigar.

08:05.935 --> 08:08.337
What do I expect
from a piece of shit like you?

08:11.683 --> 08:14.102
Well... trying to improve myself.

08:14.103 --> 08:15.228
Ha!

08:16.586 --> 08:18.146
Why bother?

08:18.147 --> 08:19.748
You were born a piece of a shit.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.389
You're gonna die a piece of shit.

08:21.390 --> 08:24.833
God, I miss your father.
Tibor knew how to run a family.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.949
Did it with class.
He did it with panache.

08:28.678 --> 08:30.702
Do you even know what that is?

08:32.041 --> 08:35.043
No. No, not really.

08:35.044 --> 08:36.249
Heh.

08:36.686 --> 08:38.287
What do I expect from a piece of shit?

08:45.855 --> 08:47.969
You think I got a chance, Josip?

08:49.137 --> 08:51.306
With the Council?

08:51.781 --> 08:54.434
I don't fuckin' know,
and I don't fuckin' care.

08:55.625 --> 08:56.906
And it's a shitty cigar.

09:06.275 --> 09:07.716
Just one second, okay?

09:07.717 --> 09:09.357
A few minutes.

09:09.358 --> 09:13.041
No, the other location.
I know they're confusing.

09:13.042 --> 09:15.203
I'll... I'll...
I'll text you that address.

09:15.204 --> 09:18.958
Okay, yeah. Okay, bye-bye.

09:19.609 --> 09:21.530
I've been waiting forever.

09:21.531 --> 09:23.011
I had to drop my kid off at school.

09:23.012 --> 09:24.547
Well, where's Charlie?

09:25.094 --> 09:26.575
He's out of town.

09:26.576 --> 09:27.656
What now?

09:30.780 --> 09:32.061
You gonna let me in, or what?

10:01.090 --> 10:02.410
What was that about?

10:02.411 --> 10:04.012
I thought you were banished.

10:04.013 --> 10:05.133
I am.

10:05.134 --> 10:06.715
For now.

10:07.456 --> 10:09.297
Trying to work my way back in.

10:09.298 --> 10:11.019
What about Fonsuardo?

10:11.020 --> 10:12.741
The fuck?

10:12.742 --> 10:15.423
You and Eduardo.
You know, like Brangelina.

10:15.424 --> 10:18.987
Hm. Well, that particular
relationship has been fruitful,

10:18.988 --> 10:21.309
but, it's more than that.

10:21.310 --> 10:25.153
I've been putting good into the world,
hoping to get some back.

10:25.154 --> 10:26.274
I know.

10:26.275 --> 10:27.637
Doesn't sound like me.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.319
Maybe it's the new you.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.162
New threads, new attitude.

10:36.085 --> 10:39.007
I need a favor.
Charlie's not here.

10:39.008 --> 10:40.623
Not that kind of favor.

10:43.084 --> 10:44.669
You mind taking a look?

10:45.855 --> 10:47.589
See if this is gonna work out for me?

10:52.982 --> 10:54.503
I don't need to look.

10:54.504 --> 10:55.864
You're putting good into the world.

10:55.865 --> 10:57.766
Good will come back to you.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.188
You think?

11:00.602 --> 11:02.270
People can change.

11:03.938 --> 11:05.273
I guess so.

11:06.836 --> 11:09.652
I mean, look how different
things are between us now.

11:10.439 --> 11:12.561
Things can change very quickly
between people,

11:12.562 --> 11:13.948
if you're open to it.

11:15.825 --> 11:16.701
Jun-Bi.

11:24.534 --> 11:27.295
You see Drina at school?
Yeah.

11:27.296 --> 11:29.422
I saw her across the lunch room.

11:29.979 --> 11:32.020
Is that okay or am I supposed
to run when I see her?

11:32.021 --> 11:34.110
I didn't say that.

11:35.345 --> 11:37.138
Who you textin' with?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.828
I'm just gettin' the math homework.

11:39.829 --> 11:40.710
Ah.
Yeah.

11:53.603 --> 11:56.164
Must be some pretty funny math homework.

11:56.165 --> 11:57.926
Well, no, no, no. This is just Jimmy.

11:57.927 --> 11:59.285
He's a funny guy.

12:00.530 --> 12:03.251
So, when does Dad come back?

12:03.252 --> 12:06.174
You must really miss him.
Okay, if you wanna know,

12:06.175 --> 12:07.576
Dad doesn't bug me about my texts.

12:07.577 --> 12:09.538
He should, 'cause bugging you

12:09.539 --> 12:11.139
is actually trying to protect you.

12:11.140 --> 12:13.822
Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah.
You're the responsible one.

12:13.823 --> 12:15.744
Hey. Watch it.

12:32.281 --> 12:35.083
Hey.
Hey.

12:35.084 --> 12:36.965
Were we supposed to go for a hike?

12:36.966 --> 12:38.741
Yeah, three days ago.

12:39.969 --> 12:41.536
Don't you have math homework?

12:42.091 --> 12:43.172
Yeah?

12:48.377 --> 12:50.659
And you missed our hike last week, too,

12:50.660 --> 12:52.381
and the week before that, and...

12:55.825 --> 12:57.586
I was avoiding you.

12:57.587 --> 12:59.508
Yeah, I'm wondering why.

12:59.509 --> 13:02.030
I guess I was avoiding having
an honest conversation

13:02.031 --> 13:03.266
with you,

13:03.953 --> 13:05.602
which didn't work.

13:06.115 --> 13:08.021
So, I'm gonna try the opposite now.

13:08.237 --> 13:09.898
Deductive reasoning.

13:10.399 --> 13:11.858
I like it.

13:12.642 --> 13:14.202
I have this bad habit of fucking up

13:14.203 --> 13:16.364
the good things in my life

13:16.365 --> 13:19.407
and you have been good to me, so...

13:19.408 --> 13:21.771
of course, I'm gonna try to fuck it up.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.122
I don't want to hurt you.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.577
You won't.

13:28.578 --> 13:30.378
I've already tried.

13:30.379 --> 13:32.295
Yeah, so don't try again.

13:33.338 --> 13:35.673
'Cause, um, I've missed you.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.885
I missed you, too.

13:40.470 --> 13:42.180
I don't want to lose you.

13:43.633 --> 13:44.849
As a friend.

13:45.354 --> 13:46.517
You won't.

13:47.156 --> 13:50.118
For the next few hours, anyway, because

13:50.119 --> 13:51.731
I am gonna make you dinner.

13:54.403 --> 13:55.484
Really?
Yeah.

14:17.547 --> 14:20.670
Stage left, row 4. Ginger gentleman.

14:25.394 --> 14:27.556
Yeah.

14:27.557 --> 14:28.917
What's your name, friend?

14:28.918 --> 14:31.363
Gavin.
Gavin, tell me about this.

14:32.481 --> 14:35.163
I guess I've had a
lot of stress at work.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.365
Lots of people hate their jobs, Gavin.

14:37.366 --> 14:39.568
Why not quit?
I have to work.

14:39.569 --> 14:42.290
No one has to do anything.

14:42.291 --> 14:43.932
It's a choice.

14:43.933 --> 14:47.120
You choose to work to feed yourself.

14:47.737 --> 14:50.081
You choose to work to feed...

14:50.740 --> 14:53.422
Wife and daughter.
...your wife and daughter?

14:56.465 --> 14:57.630
Yeah.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.389
We have to own our choices

15:01.390 --> 15:03.752
so we can understand why we make them.

15:03.753 --> 15:07.916
You're right. And I don't hate my job.

15:07.917 --> 15:09.078
I hate my boss.

15:11.761 --> 15:15.106
Boss... Randall. Hold tight.

15:16.441 --> 15:17.775
Got it?

15:19.208 --> 15:21.070
Perhaps it's because...

15:22.488 --> 15:24.733
he reminds you of your father.

15:24.734 --> 15:25.814
Mm.
Mm.

15:29.619 --> 15:32.020
Tell me what you really want, Gavin.

15:32.021 --> 15:34.302
I-I want a new job.
Are you sure?

15:34.303 --> 15:35.904
A new job?

15:35.905 --> 15:38.296
'Cause you just said you like your job.

15:38.668 --> 15:40.989
Gavin, a friend of mine told me a story

15:40.990 --> 15:45.178
about a 6th-century monk,
Benedict of Nursia.

15:45.755 --> 15:47.716
And you know monks...
they kneel, they pray,

15:47.717 --> 15:48.797
and they make beer all day.

15:48.798 --> 15:50.975
This monk

15:51.521 --> 15:54.202
decided one day that it was
impossible for him

15:54.203 --> 15:57.365
to live a virtuous life

15:57.366 --> 15:59.327
in the fallen Roman Empire.

15:59.328 --> 16:02.195
So, he makes a monastery

16:04.093 --> 16:06.282
and he secludes himself there.

16:07.116 --> 16:08.496
Doesn't that sound awesome?

16:08.497 --> 16:09.869
Just walk away,

16:10.459 --> 16:12.121
someplace new?

16:12.822 --> 16:14.342
Start over?

16:14.343 --> 16:17.587
None of your baggage.
None of your mistakes.

16:20.069 --> 16:21.506
It's tempting.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.033
No fuckin' way.

16:25.034 --> 16:26.755
You've got rent.

16:26.756 --> 16:28.116
You've got a family.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.878
You've got responsibilities.

16:29.879 --> 16:31.840
You can't leave.

16:31.841 --> 16:33.361
You stay.

16:33.362 --> 16:35.524
You tear it down.

16:35.525 --> 16:38.046
You build someone better.

16:38.047 --> 16:40.208
And your asshole father;
and your asshole boss,

16:40.209 --> 16:42.290
who reminds you of your asshole father?

16:42.291 --> 16:45.173
They're all excuses!

16:45.174 --> 16:48.056
Sure, they make it hard,
but mostly they make it easier

16:48.057 --> 16:50.098
for you to quit on yourself

16:50.099 --> 16:52.380
and I'm not gonna quit on you, Gavin.

16:52.381 --> 16:54.102
I'm not gonna quit on any of you,

16:54.103 --> 16:55.984
as long as you do the work,

16:55.985 --> 16:58.547
but it's not my job
to do the work for you.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.628
Sorry.

17:01.511 --> 17:04.512
I'm here to keep you honest.

17:04.513 --> 17:06.434
You tell me, Gavin,

17:06.435 --> 17:09.428
are you ready to build someone better?

17:10.398 --> 17:11.640
I am.
Are you gonna build

17:11.641 --> 17:13.080
someone better?

17:13.082 --> 17:15.564
I am.
Make me belive!

17:15.565 --> 17:16.645
I'm gonna build someone better.

17:16.646 --> 17:18.326
Say it like you fuckin' mean it!

17:18.327 --> 17:19.887
I'm gonna build someone better!

17:19.888 --> 17:23.411
That's what I wanna hear!

17:33.062 --> 17:35.223
Great work today, Charlie.

17:35.224 --> 17:36.785
It was way too hot in there.

17:36.786 --> 17:38.507
I need it to be sub-zero.

17:38.508 --> 17:40.909
When I sweat,
the earwig moves around too much.

17:40.910 --> 17:42.310
We kept it cold.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.214
It's just the bright lights of stardom.

17:46.115 --> 17:50.553
The afterparty is still onstage,
as far as we're concerned.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.264
Ugh!

17:55.605 --> 17:56.806
Can you give us the room?

17:59.228 --> 18:00.730
May I have my phone back, please?

18:02.251 --> 18:03.932
You missed a call from your wife.

18:03.933 --> 18:05.493
Doesn't she know when you're onstage?

18:05.494 --> 18:07.696
There's never a bad time
for my wife to call me

18:07.697 --> 18:08.937
and I need to call her back.

18:08.938 --> 18:10.659
Ooh, so tense!

18:10.660 --> 18:13.141
But it doesn't show onstage.

18:13.142 --> 18:17.038
You were a fucking rock star
out there today.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.949
I knew you had the presence
to fill that space, like...

18:20.950 --> 18:22.751
David Copperfield.

18:22.752 --> 18:25.954
He made the Statue of Liberty
disappear when I was a kid.

18:25.955 --> 18:27.917
You're gonna play all the big spaces,
Charlie.

18:30.439 --> 18:32.922
You are going to play
Madison Square Garden.

18:42.652 --> 18:43.772
Showtime!

18:46.696 --> 18:48.817
Hi. Thanks for coming.

18:48.818 --> 18:50.338
Oh, do you mind?
Yeah, sure.

18:50.339 --> 18:51.820
All right.

18:51.821 --> 18:53.782
Sure. There you go.

18:53.783 --> 18:55.423
Can you please wait?

18:55.424 --> 18:57.626
It's Gavin.
Yeah, I know.

18:57.627 --> 18:58.907
All right.
I'll see you in here.

18:58.908 --> 19:00.308
All right, great.
All right.

19:00.309 --> 19:03.191
All right, ready?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.557
Mmm!
Mm-hmm?

19:11.360 --> 19:15.283
Concentrate.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.245
Hey!

19:17.246 --> 19:19.848
Don't analyze.

19:19.849 --> 19:22.130
Don't process.

19:22.131 --> 19:24.533
Just take in, and then...

19:24.534 --> 19:27.896
Jody.

19:27.897 --> 19:29.658
Thank you. I've been

19:29.659 --> 19:33.822
Waiting for this all night.

19:33.823 --> 19:37.025
Oh. Ooh. You call that a Sazerac?

19:37.026 --> 19:38.827
Stay right there. Don't move, mister.

19:38.828 --> 19:39.948
Excuse me.

19:39.949 --> 19:41.830
Uh-oh. Here we go.

19:41.831 --> 19:46.515
Yeah.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.397
Skosh?

19:51.721 --> 19:53.722
You must chill the glass.

19:53.723 --> 19:55.964
A cube of sugar.

19:55.965 --> 19:58.286
Two dashes of Angostura.

19:58.287 --> 20:01.890
Three dashes of Peychaud.

20:02.892 --> 20:04.693
A healthy ounce

20:04.694 --> 20:06.775
of rye.

20:06.776 --> 20:10.378
Hint of absinthe.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.224
Press

20:16.225 --> 20:17.106
your lemon.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.029
Prime the glass.

20:24.273 --> 20:26.595
Ohh. Let's build a better drink.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.681
Who's next? Who's next?

20:32.682 --> 20:34.122
Trouble. It happens.

20:34.123 --> 20:35.644
Yeah,
you don't want a call from the cops.

20:35.645 --> 20:38.206
I think every parent,
and speaking to this,

20:38.207 --> 20:39.367
at least once maybe,

20:39.368 --> 20:40.649
Mom.
If they have a son...

20:40.650 --> 20:43.225
Okay, let's hear one of your stories.

20:45.615 --> 20:48.056
That Maggie,

20:48.057 --> 20:51.059
she really is something.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.140
Something, indeed.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.347
Oh, oh, okay.

20:59.348 --> 21:00.669
Is this a good one?
Yeah.

21:00.670 --> 21:02.951
Um, superhandsome, old movie star.

21:02.952 --> 21:04.352
Come on, Nick.
Will you help me with this?

21:04.353 --> 21:05.754
I don't know who this is.
No, not...

21:05.755 --> 21:06.835
What do you mean
you don't know who this is?

21:06.836 --> 21:08.637
Montgomery Clift?
Yes!

21:08.638 --> 21:09.838
Done.

21:09.839 --> 21:10.999
You next?

21:17.126 --> 21:19.568
Excuse me.

21:20.810 --> 21:21.850
Okay.

21:27.617 --> 21:29.658
Oh!

21:35.024 --> 21:37.666
Cowboy. Cowboy. It's a Western.
Yes.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.588
Yeah, uh, it's a person.
I have to pee.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.429
Uh, I have a pregnant-lady bladder.
Sorry.

21:43.833 --> 21:46.955
She's cool.
She is.

21:46.956 --> 21:51.520
This is very good.

21:52.922 --> 21:54.923
Hi!
What?

21:54.924 --> 21:57.005
Charlie, may I have a word?
Ahem.

21:57.006 --> 21:59.127
Sorry, might take him away for a second.

21:59.128 --> 22:00.609
Charlie, come.
Yeah.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.650
Come on.

22:02.692 --> 22:06.454
Hey.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.456
We had so much fun. Thank you.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.458
No, it was my pleasure.

22:12.148 --> 22:14.623
Good night.

22:19.909 --> 22:22.867
That was fun. That was fun!

22:25.154 --> 22:26.354
I'm glad.

22:26.355 --> 22:28.076
Ohhh!
It is good to see you

22:28.077 --> 22:31.709
having fun.
It's good seeing you, Maggie.

22:32.161 --> 22:34.523
Good night, Charlie.
Good night.

22:34.837 --> 22:36.765
Good night.

22:36.766 --> 22:38.847
Oh!

22:42.091 --> 22:44.012
Ohhh!

22:53.382 --> 22:54.864
Aw, fuck it.

23:37.787 --> 23:38.868
The receiver...

23:43.232 --> 23:44.834
and the microphone.

23:46.996 --> 23:49.157
It's voice-activated,

23:49.158 --> 23:51.760
so all you need to do is talk into it

23:51.761 --> 23:53.958
right before you go out and mingle.

23:54.483 --> 23:57.606
I admire your ingenuity,
but I don't think

23:57.607 --> 24:01.489
that Josip will sit down at the
kris and confess to a crime.

24:01.490 --> 24:03.008
We don't, either.

24:04.133 --> 24:06.294
Oh! You are afraid

24:06.295 --> 24:09.217
I'll tell the Council
I'm under surveillance.

24:09.218 --> 24:11.559
He said you were a sharp one.

24:12.662 --> 24:14.183
Why would I betray you now?

24:16.906 --> 24:20.068
How do I know you haven't
been betraying us all along?

24:20.069 --> 24:22.150
You're a career criminal who wants me

24:22.151 --> 24:24.753
to suddenly trust her like
she's a Girl Scout.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.635
Whatever she is, she's smart enough

24:26.636 --> 24:28.436
to play it straight with us.

24:28.437 --> 24:30.238
One fucking con artist
who's willing to lie

24:30.239 --> 24:32.320
to a bunch of other fucking con artists.

24:32.321 --> 24:34.724
You're about that much
better in my book.

24:37.847 --> 24:41.255
Were you a Girl Scout, Agent Sims?

24:42.211 --> 24:44.925
I sold more Tagalongs
than any girls in my troop.

24:45.535 --> 24:49.017
Well, do you realize it is
the same kind of pyramid scheme?

24:49.018 --> 24:50.298
Okay, eh, eh,
No, no, no, no. There's no...

24:50.299 --> 24:53.902
let's refocus here. Look...

24:53.903 --> 24:56.705
I'm rooting for you, but,

24:56.706 --> 24:59.347
don't be confused
about which side I'm on.

24:59.348 --> 25:01.550
Okay, if you're done with your lecture,
I'll go home

25:01.551 --> 25:03.872
and help Simza get prepared.

25:03.873 --> 25:06.595
You wouldn't want me missing too long.

25:06.596 --> 25:07.996
Hey.

25:07.997 --> 25:09.197
He thinks you're smart enough

25:09.198 --> 25:10.919
not to forget the jewelry,

25:10.920 --> 25:12.601
or to tamper with it,

25:12.602 --> 25:15.203
or find yourself not at home
and miss it altogether.

25:15.204 --> 25:17.045
'Cause you'll know; you'll find out.

25:17.046 --> 25:18.727
I understand.

25:18.728 --> 25:21.369
I'll be very careful with my...

25:21.370 --> 25:23.011
bespoke jewelry.

25:23.012 --> 25:25.090
And be careful in general.

25:25.535 --> 25:27.055
These people are killers, you know.

25:28.858 --> 25:30.179
Of course, I know.

25:30.971 --> 25:32.021
I'm one of them.

25:48.117 --> 25:49.678
Welcome.

25:49.679 --> 25:52.320
Please make yourself at home.

25:52.321 --> 25:53.962
Have a drink.

25:53.963 --> 25:55.044
Or three.

26:03.893 --> 26:06.382
Simza.
Welcome, Josip.

26:07.056 --> 26:08.857
Lovely as ever.
Ah.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.379
I suppose we'll begin when
the head of the house appears?

26:11.380 --> 26:13.182
Of course. He's coming right down.

26:25.995 --> 26:27.116
Piece of shit.

26:28.958 --> 26:30.559
Where the hell's your husband?

26:30.560 --> 26:32.280
The Emo King?

26:32.281 --> 26:33.882
He's bummed about something.

26:34.243 --> 26:36.605
He's pouting by the pool.

26:36.606 --> 26:40.288
Okay, you keep welcoming them.
Mm-hmm.

26:40.289 --> 26:41.458
Hi.

26:42.211 --> 26:44.574
Tony.

26:46.976 --> 26:48.057
Tony!

26:50.499 --> 26:52.621
What?
"What?"

26:52.622 --> 26:54.462
You're embarrassing me, okay?

26:54.463 --> 26:57.224
And not just me, the whole family.

26:57.707 --> 26:59.508
I just don't see the point.

26:59.509 --> 27:02.110
In bringing Fonso back into the family?

27:02.111 --> 27:03.632
I don't care about him.

27:03.633 --> 27:05.433
Then what's the fuckin'
point you don't see?

27:05.434 --> 27:06.795
I'm supposed to be
the head of the family,

27:06.796 --> 27:08.598
and I can't even do fucking math!

27:11.280 --> 27:15.159
I will help you, sweetie. I always do.

27:16.045 --> 27:17.926
Can you help me with my wife?

27:18.495 --> 27:20.664
Because she doesn't love me.

27:21.290 --> 27:24.332
And you know what?
I don't think I love her.

27:24.333 --> 27:27.936
But we're married
and I've got a wife and a job

27:27.937 --> 27:30.883
and everything else all set out
for me for the rest of my life.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.385
I fucking suck at it all.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.521
It's gonna be okay.

27:45.474 --> 27:46.675
Yeah? How?

27:49.559 --> 27:50.999
It's gonna be okay.

28:05.334 --> 28:06.960
Testing?

28:07.577 --> 28:08.841
Testing?

28:09.899 --> 28:11.339
Uh, this is, uh,

28:11.340 --> 28:14.943
a con artist with a message for

28:14.944 --> 28:17.866
a certain special Girl Scout.

28:17.867 --> 28:19.067
Go fuck yourself!

28:22.832 --> 28:23.913
Yes?

28:25.955 --> 28:27.676
Grandma? Everyone's here.

28:27.677 --> 28:30.959
Oh. You look so beautiful.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.480
You, too.
Aw.

28:32.481 --> 28:35.003
I like your necklace.
Oh.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.032
Oh, this old thing?

28:39.048 --> 28:40.202
Grandma.

28:41.370 --> 28:44.373
Thanks for doing this.
Oh, don't thank me yet.

28:44.854 --> 28:46.775
First, we have to convince the Council

28:46.776 --> 28:48.961
that your father has changed.

28:49.779 --> 28:51.505
And, hopefully, he has.

28:52.542 --> 28:53.783
Let's go.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.242
Yes.

29:39.989 --> 29:41.889
Where's the head of the family?

29:43.640 --> 29:45.309
You're lookin' at her.

29:46.556 --> 29:48.757
I meant Anthony Ranko II.

29:48.758 --> 29:51.439
Li'I Tony is in his room.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.202
Like the other little children.

29:54.203 --> 29:55.644
That's where he belongs.

29:55.645 --> 29:58.807
And I am here with you, where I belong.

29:58.808 --> 30:00.248
Simza...
You're gonna let me

30:00.249 --> 30:01.867
have my say.

30:03.653 --> 30:07.375
Now, I have sat in the back
of a million of these,

30:07.376 --> 30:09.137
keeping my mouth shut,

30:09.138 --> 30:11.877
because I didn't think it was my place.

30:13.623 --> 30:14.671
Well,

30:15.545 --> 30:17.946
this is my place now

30:17.947 --> 30:22.631
and I am fuckin'
done being the boss' wife,

30:22.632 --> 30:23.952
the boss' mother.

30:23.953 --> 30:26.034
I am the fuckin' boss

30:26.035 --> 30:29.838
and I am here to tell you
fucks what's what!

30:33.643 --> 30:34.803
Now...

30:38.447 --> 30:42.931
I need a solid earner to get
my corporation back on track

30:42.932 --> 30:46.214
and I have a house full of kids
who need a father.

30:46.215 --> 30:50.098
There is someone just outside

30:50.099 --> 30:52.380
who fits both fuckin' bills.

30:52.381 --> 30:54.743
Now, whatever else
you want to say about him...

30:54.744 --> 30:56.745
and trust me, I could say plenty...

30:56.746 --> 30:59.708
he has got his shit together now

30:59.709 --> 31:02.350
and he loves his kids.

31:06.516 --> 31:09.638
Well this is pretty unusual.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.003
Fuckin' A, Big Jim.

31:18.648 --> 31:20.048
Go for the hockey puck.

31:20.049 --> 31:22.251
Stage right, front row. Seat 5.

31:25.735 --> 31:27.696
This has some stories to it.

31:28.036 --> 31:29.738
Been bounced around a lot.

31:29.739 --> 31:31.860
Can't seem to sit still.

31:31.861 --> 31:33.101
No, really,

31:33.102 --> 31:34.584
that's what I'm feeling.

31:38.027 --> 31:39.881
Cold feet.

31:42.111 --> 31:43.593
What's your name?

31:44.594 --> 31:46.795
Elizabeth. Liz.

31:46.796 --> 31:48.117
Tell me what's on your mind, Liz.

31:51.601 --> 31:53.186
I'm in love.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.732
I'm feeling you're not happy about that.

31:57.286 --> 32:00.408
What's the significance
of the hockey puck?

32:00.409 --> 32:03.451
Um, we were...
My fiance and I were at a Sharks game.

32:03.452 --> 32:05.253
It got deflected into the stands.

32:05.254 --> 32:08.136
And he caught it
with his catlike reflexes?

32:08.137 --> 32:10.699
He ducked, and I caught it.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.541
Oh, no, I feel so bad.

32:12.542 --> 32:17.786
He's the sweetest,
nicest guy in the world.

32:17.787 --> 32:19.548
But not a hockey player.

32:19.549 --> 32:21.631
Not a hockey player.

32:22.151 --> 32:23.712
Parents split when she was three.

32:23.713 --> 32:26.635
Mum remarried a younger man.
They moved away.

32:26.636 --> 32:27.917
What are you afraid of, Liz?

32:33.042 --> 32:34.643
You were right.

32:34.644 --> 32:36.772
I am in love, but...

32:37.486 --> 32:39.691
not with him.

32:40.810 --> 32:43.212
I was afraid that I would
never feel real love...

32:45.975 --> 32:47.532
but now I am

32:48.618 --> 32:51.099
and I'm afraid of hurting him.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.142
The sweetest, nicest guy in the world.

32:56.465 --> 33:00.869
You are hurting him,
by not being honest with him.

33:00.870 --> 33:02.430
And, if you're already hurting him,

33:02.431 --> 33:04.272
what's the sense in hurting yourself,
too?

33:06.756 --> 33:09.197
But you haven't answered my question.

33:09.198 --> 33:10.879
What are you afraid of?

33:15.004 --> 33:17.405
That you'll end up being
just like your mom?

33:23.212 --> 33:25.195
She left your dad, didn't she?

33:27.056 --> 33:28.737
Yeah.
And he was also

33:28.738 --> 33:30.739
the sweetest, nicest guy in the world,

33:30.740 --> 33:32.701
and you don't want to be just like her.

33:35.825 --> 33:37.666
You're not her.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.868
I know that because you're here.

33:39.869 --> 33:43.832
You're trying to build someone better.

33:43.833 --> 33:47.235
But to do that,
you have to be brutally honest.

33:47.236 --> 33:50.078
Don't be afraid of looking selfish.

33:50.079 --> 33:51.920
We're all selfish. It's human nature.

33:51.921 --> 33:53.849
It's not bad.

33:55.565 --> 33:57.245
No, no, no. Th-That's not it.

33:57.246 --> 33:58.478
What...?

34:00.570 --> 34:02.130
What are you truly afraid of, Liz?

34:06.055 --> 34:08.857
Now that I feel it, true love,

34:08.858 --> 34:11.074
what if I can't have it?

34:12.181 --> 34:13.902
What if, now I know what I'm missing

34:13.902 --> 34:15.864
and I have to live without it?

34:18.107 --> 34:20.148
Are you okay? I haven't got any more.

34:32.601 --> 34:34.723
You're gonna find true love
in your life, Liz.

34:37.166 --> 34:40.020
You're more in control of it
than you think.

34:40.730 --> 34:43.891
You need to go out
and get it for yourself.

34:51.900 --> 34:52.982
Let's keep going.

34:59.148 --> 35:01.429
You have to be quicker on the draw.

35:01.430 --> 35:03.471
I was halfway across
the wrong side of the room

35:03.472 --> 35:04.713
with those earmuffs.

35:04.714 --> 35:07.130
And, please, do not chat with me.

35:07.517 --> 35:09.257
Yes, sir.

35:10.079 --> 35:12.280
And your phone, sir.

35:12.281 --> 35:14.304
Your wife called again.

35:15.204 --> 35:17.205
I'm gonna hit the hay. I am exhausted,

35:17.206 --> 35:18.527
being on my feet.

35:18.528 --> 35:20.809
I'm used to doing this sitting down.

35:20.810 --> 35:22.170
I thought you were a magician.

35:22.171 --> 35:24.332
When I was 12.

35:24.333 --> 35:25.494
Get some rest.

35:49.599 --> 35:50.679
Nora.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.000
Hey, I'm so sorry.

35:52.001 --> 35:53.113
It's okay.

35:54.163 --> 35:56.484
Linda, I think that something's wrong.

35:56.485 --> 35:57.966
What is it?
I don't know.

35:57.967 --> 36:00.168
Uh, but it hurts.
Did you call your doctor?

36:00.169 --> 36:02.560
Unh-unh. Can you just come here?

36:03.172 --> 36:04.814
Call your doctor. I'll be right there.

36:12.301 --> 36:13.697
I gotta run out.

36:14.063 --> 36:15.303
Why? What is it?

36:15.304 --> 36:16.705
I got a sick friend.

36:16.706 --> 36:19.027
You can call Vicki if you can't get me.

36:19.028 --> 36:21.630
I can be alone.
Dad leaves me alone all the time.

36:21.631 --> 36:23.632
You should probably stop
ratting out your father.

36:23.633 --> 36:24.994
Keep your phone charged, okay?

36:34.844 --> 36:37.005
Nora, it's me.

36:37.006 --> 36:38.206
It's open.

36:42.852 --> 36:45.333
Oh. I'm okay.

36:45.334 --> 36:47.576
You're okay?
Yeah.

36:47.577 --> 36:50.378
Here.
Um, I, um...

36:50.379 --> 36:52.581
I spoke to my OB and she said

36:52.582 --> 36:54.779
that I can just come by in the morning.

36:55.384 --> 36:57.946
Did she say what it was?
No, just that she wasn't

36:57.947 --> 36:59.548
too concerned because it went away,

36:59.549 --> 37:02.620
and that I could wait 'til the morning.

37:03.633 --> 37:06.274
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry to
drag you out of bed like this.

37:06.275 --> 37:07.834
It's okay.

37:08.838 --> 37:10.879
Would you stay the night?

37:11.761 --> 37:13.361
Oh, I-I-I don't know.

37:13.362 --> 37:14.382
Please?

37:15.300 --> 37:16.445
I don't want to be alone.

37:20.650 --> 37:22.057
Of course.

37:23.412 --> 37:24.934
Of course I will.

37:25.535 --> 37:28.216
I can just sleep right there,
on the couch.

37:28.217 --> 37:30.699
Oh, my... Don't be silly.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.380
Come on, I can keep my hands to myself.

37:32.381 --> 37:35.143
I'm sure you can, too.

37:43.513 --> 37:45.313
Hi, Charlie.

37:46.081 --> 37:48.957
Oh, whoa. Um...

37:48.958 --> 37:52.000
You're... Liz, right?

37:52.001 --> 37:53.642
You remembered.

37:53.643 --> 37:54.883
How'd you get in here?

37:55.298 --> 37:56.565
I bribed the maid.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.406
Don't be mad at her, though.
I was very persuasive.

37:58.407 --> 38:01.650
Uh, you need to put
your clothes back on, and, uh,

38:01.651 --> 38:04.012
we can have a little talk maybe.

38:04.013 --> 38:09.145
Didn't you say that there's
no shame in being selfish?

38:09.819 --> 38:12.821
It's human nature?

38:12.822 --> 38:16.104
So, I'm being honest about what I want.

38:16.105 --> 38:18.426
And, Charlie,

38:18.427 --> 38:19.948
it's you.

38:19.949 --> 38:22.671
You're the real love that I feel.

38:22.672 --> 38:24.713
Okay, Liz, I don't want to hurt you.

38:24.714 --> 38:26.755
Don't threaten me with a good time.

38:26.756 --> 38:28.677
Okay, there are lines you don't cross,

38:28.678 --> 38:30.519
and you're crossing
several of them right now.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.841
Then what's one more?
Okay, Liz...

38:32.842 --> 38:33.922
Liz. Okay.

38:33.923 --> 38:35.083
Liz.

38:35.084 --> 38:36.885
Okay. Unh.

38:36.886 --> 38:38.406
That is enough.

38:39.809 --> 38:41.770
You let her get on top of you?

38:41.771 --> 38:43.572
Hell, you let her in the room.

38:43.573 --> 38:45.013
She bribed her way in!

38:45.014 --> 38:47.856
So?
Did you leave when you first saw her?

38:47.857 --> 38:51.499
No, you engaged.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.181
He tried to help me.

38:53.523 --> 38:55.584
He was trying to save me.

38:55.585 --> 38:58.653
There are two fuckin'
crazy women in this room.

38:59.188 --> 39:00.447
Thank you, Liz.

39:01.430 --> 39:02.592
That'll be all.

39:05.074 --> 39:07.355
Pleasure working with you, Charlie.

39:09.318 --> 39:11.039
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:11.040 --> 39:13.001
Is this some kind of sick lesson?!

39:13.002 --> 39:16.044
It was a vivid and essential lesson.

39:16.045 --> 39:18.567
One mistake like that
will cost you your career.

39:18.568 --> 39:20.488
Wow!
Charlie, women throw themselves

39:20.489 --> 39:22.931
at Paz at every retreat,

39:22.932 --> 39:25.013
but he believes he is a righteous man.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.776
You, you know you're a sinner.

39:27.777 --> 39:29.938
You are a fuckin' control freak.

39:29.939 --> 39:31.780
You need to be beyond reproach!
You don't own me.

39:31.781 --> 39:34.503
You need to avoid even
the appearance of impropriety!

39:34.504 --> 39:36.345
I don't belong to you!

39:38.868 --> 39:40.778
I am your partner.

39:42.231 --> 39:44.913
And only one of us knows how to manage

39:44.914 --> 39:46.843
this kind of career.
Agh!

39:47.837 --> 39:49.397
Care to guess which one?

39:49.398 --> 39:51.039
I want you outta here.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.683
I want you out of my life!

40:39.328 --> 40:40.929
Thanks for staying.

40:40.930 --> 40:42.090
Of course.

40:52.461 --> 40:55.103
Hm.

41:53.322 --> 41:55.163
You're right to be angry with me.

42:27.517 --> 42:28.946
Good night.

42:29.799 --> 42:30.919
Good night.

43:14.724 --> 43:16.444
Mm.

43:16.445 --> 43:17.766
Hey.

43:17.767 --> 43:19.608
Hey.
Oh.

43:19.609 --> 43:21.970
I didn't want to wake you,
but, I have to get back to Nick.

43:21.971 --> 43:24.733
Of course. Of course.
Thank you for staying.

43:24.734 --> 43:26.174
I really appreciate it.

43:26.175 --> 43:27.936
It means so much to me
that I can count on you.

43:27.937 --> 43:29.297
You know, you're such a good friend.

43:29.298 --> 43:31.059
Just returning the favor.

43:33.142 --> 43:35.221
I'll call you later.
You better.

43:58.367 --> 44:00.128
I mean, they said noon, right?

44:00.129 --> 44:01.611
Yeah, noon.

44:06.856 --> 44:08.738
I mean, they're late!
Yeah, they're late.

44:16.387 --> 44:18.139
What the fuck is that?

44:18.628 --> 44:19.708
My gun.

44:19.709 --> 44:21.830
We agreed no guns.

44:21.831 --> 44:24.032
You agreed no guns.

44:24.033 --> 44:26.555
Mama Bustamante didn't raise
an ese dumb enough

44:26.556 --> 44:28.797
to come to a meet like this unarmed.

44:28.798 --> 44:30.238
We agreed no guns.

44:30.239 --> 44:31.920
Those were the parameters.

44:31.921 --> 44:34.002
You don't think Cordero's
gonna be packing?

44:34.003 --> 44:35.363
He's buying guns!

44:35.364 --> 44:36.925
Why would he have guns?!

44:36.926 --> 44:40.048
He's a businessman, like us, okay?

44:40.049 --> 44:42.251
We made a deal. Let's stick to it.

44:47.096 --> 44:48.577
All right, partner.

44:48.578 --> 44:50.671
I'll put it in the glove compartment.

44:51.861 --> 44:53.341
Jun-Bi.

45:04.073 --> 45:05.474
What the fuck?

45:10.159 --> 45:11.600
You think that's them?

45:11.601 --> 45:13.321
Or some kind of fucked-up field trip.

45:33.703 --> 45:35.985
Vamos!
Agarren todo y vamonos de aqui­!

45:39.028 --> 45:40.749
Sorry.

45:40.750 --> 45:42.831
Where's our fuckin' money?

45:52.001 --> 45:53.482
The fuck are you doing?

45:55.605 --> 45:57.365
Tryin' to go green, motherfuckers.

45:57.366 --> 45:58.887
IT'S LIKE MY KIDS SAY:

45:59.156 --> 46:01.617
"Reduce, reuse, and recycle."

46:03.092 --> 46:04.292
Get on your fucking knees.

46:04.293 --> 46:05.574
Go fuck yourself.

46:05.575 --> 46:06.655
Ah!

46:08.017 --> 46:08.898
Ah.

46:14.784 --> 46:16.384
You won't fuckin' do this.

46:16.385 --> 46:18.386
No, I won't.

46:18.387 --> 46:20.428
But the homie with the shotgun will.

46:20.429 --> 46:22.096
Unless I get some truth.

46:22.632 --> 46:24.232
Now, where the fuck is Caygeon?

46:24.233 --> 46:27.018
He's gone.

46:28.269 --> 46:30.438
Who the fuck are you?

46:30.439 --> 46:32.160
His supplier?

46:32.161 --> 46:33.962
'Cause that's what you told me,
that I wasn't gonna be

46:33.963 --> 46:36.965
dealing with any middlemen. Just...

46:36.966 --> 46:39.087
soft-around-the-middle men.

46:44.493 --> 46:45.774
Yoi Devla,

46:45.775 --> 46:47.576
del prikaza Cordero,

46:47.577 --> 46:49.290
benga rakle.

46:50.666 --> 46:51.900
What the fuck was that?

46:51.901 --> 46:53.210
You're fucked.

46:55.304 --> 46:56.839
It was a curse.

46:57.426 --> 46:59.550
A Gypsy curse.

46:59.869 --> 47:01.710
On you,

47:01.711 --> 47:03.391
on your children,

47:03.846 --> 47:06.274
and on your children's children.

47:06.275 --> 47:08.517
A ver si tu maldicion para esta bala,
gitano.

47:10.439 --> 47:13.121
Sure. Go ahead.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.883
Kill us now.

47:14.884 --> 47:17.045
Never enjoy another good night's sleep

47:17.046 --> 47:20.008
until it's your fuckin' last, or...

47:20.009 --> 47:22.290
we go ahead with the deal as planned,

47:22.291 --> 47:24.853
and all is forgiven.

47:24.854 --> 47:26.014
Forgiven?

47:28.978 --> 47:31.165
Who the fuck are you, hm?

47:32.301 --> 47:34.142
You wanna know who I am?

47:35.945 --> 47:38.047
I'm Roma, motherfucker.

47:38.828 --> 47:42.551
Fonso Marks of the Gypsies.

47:42.552 --> 47:44.513
And you fuck with Gypsies...

47:46.395 --> 47:48.597
Gypsies fuck you.

47:48.598 --> 47:49.758
Forever.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.686
Mnh.

47:57.687 --> 47:58.967
All right.

47:58.968 --> 48:01.570
I asked a question. I got an answer.

48:01.571 --> 48:03.489
No hard feelings, right?

48:05.735 --> 48:06.935
Agarra el dinero.

48:39.488 --> 48:41.110
Here is fine.

48:42.131 --> 48:43.612
Your house is a ways up the road.

48:43.613 --> 48:45.197
Like I said, here is fine.

49:01.390 --> 49:03.952
Are we really gonna act out
some teenage farce?

49:03.953 --> 49:05.634
Maybe it's an adult farce.

49:05.635 --> 49:08.196
You are a guilt-ridden mess
and you are dismantling

49:08.197 --> 49:09.758
the better you I've been building!

49:11.961 --> 49:15.394
Was last night a tuneup for the machine?

49:16.005 --> 49:17.229
Yours and mine.

49:17.807 --> 49:19.688
I don't want to hurt my wife.

49:19.689 --> 49:21.770
The only way either of us
can hurt her now

49:21.771 --> 49:23.332
is by telling her the truth.

49:28.337 --> 49:30.258
I'll see you Wednesday.

49:30.259 --> 49:31.660
I'd like you to work on...

49:31.661 --> 49:33.221
talking about yourself more.

49:33.222 --> 49:34.663
It helps to build trust.

49:34.664 --> 49:37.065
I don't know anything about you.

49:37.066 --> 49:38.227
My case in point.
