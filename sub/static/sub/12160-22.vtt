WEBVTT

00:06.217 --> 00:07.883
What do you think?

00:07.951 --> 00:12.054
It's better than the R.V.,
the toilet empties itself.

00:12.122 --> 00:16.558
And it doesn't rock violently
when I cross the room.

00:16.627 --> 00:19.328
You know, dad, we can certainly
look at other places.

00:19.395 --> 00:20.663
I mean, you're gonna be here
a whole year

00:20.731 --> 00:21.998
while you build the new store.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.765
I did two tours in 'nam.

00:23.833 --> 00:25.366
If it's not a tunnel
filled with snakes,

00:25.434 --> 00:27.769
I'm good.

00:27.837 --> 00:31.305
Yeah. This from the guy that
sent his spaghetti back twice.

00:31.373 --> 00:33.675
I didn't like the way
the kitchen prepared it.

00:33.743 --> 00:36.778
We weren't at a restaurant.

00:36.846 --> 00:40.514
Hey, grandpa, are you sure
this place isn't too small?

00:40.581 --> 00:42.449
"Too small"?

00:42.517 --> 00:44.184
Me and Nana's first apartment
was a studio

00:44.252 --> 00:45.753
with a broken Murphy bed.

00:45.820 --> 00:48.756
We slept at a 45-degree angle.

00:48.823 --> 00:53.093
If one of us got up, the other
one was pancaked into the wall.

00:53.161 --> 00:55.629
Mike?
Uh-huh.

00:55.696 --> 00:56.996
Honey, you know,

00:57.064 --> 00:59.132
I don't like this place.
It's depressing.

00:59.199 --> 01:01.167
It's gonna be fine. My brother's
gonna move in in 30 days.

01:01.234 --> 01:03.435
He'll have a roommate, right?
Have some company?

01:03.503 --> 01:05.504
Yeah, but... it's... the price is right.
It's close to work.

01:05.572 --> 01:07.974
It's gonna be fine. He's family.
Shouldn't he be living with us?

01:08.042 --> 01:10.543
Whoo! Whoa! No.

01:10.610 --> 01:13.845
<i>No</i> way. Look at him.

01:13.913 --> 01:15.513
Too light.

01:15.581 --> 01:17.282
No, too dark.

01:17.349 --> 01:19.117
Too light.

01:19.185 --> 01:21.252
Way too dark.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.387
That's it!

01:22.454 --> 01:24.289
Nope, you missed it.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Sync & corrections by into-the-light.
www.addic7ed.com

01:31.763 --> 01:34.098
and here we are in cozumel.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.399
Ooh!
We're parasailing.

01:35.466 --> 01:37.968
Look at you two kids!
Look at that!

01:38.036 --> 01:39.503
Mexico.
Yeah.

01:39.571 --> 01:40.971
Yeah, I used to take my...

01:41.039 --> 01:44.540
my wives number
one, two, and four there.

01:44.608 --> 01:47.410
Number three was a racist.

01:50.047 --> 01:52.481
A gorgeous, gorgeous racist.

01:56.087 --> 01:59.155
And this is us in acapulco.
Ah, look at that!

01:59.223 --> 02:00.555
What are you doing,
showing pictures

02:00.623 --> 02:02.390
of you and mom in Mexico?

02:02.458 --> 02:04.392
No, it's me and Stella,
the woman I've been seeing.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.994
I told you about her.
Yeah.

02:06.062 --> 02:09.764
She looks great in a bathing
skirt, doesn't she? Oh, yeah.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.567
Well, let's just, uh,
put the pictures away, okay?

02:12.635 --> 02:15.370
Come on. I love your dad.
He's... he's a great storyteller.

02:15.438 --> 02:16.938
Yeah, he is.
Has he told you the story

02:17.005 --> 02:19.640
about how he invented
the big Mac?

02:19.708 --> 02:23.444
All I can say is that I was
eating two all-beef patties

02:23.511 --> 02:25.046
at a picnic...
Uh-huh.

02:25.114 --> 02:28.616
And there was a clown
staring at me.

02:30.753 --> 02:32.853
Tell me that's a coincidence.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.290
That's a coincidence.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.026
Mr. A., Mr. B.
Hmm?

02:40.094 --> 02:41.895
Doctor's ready for your physicals.
Ooh. Right.

02:41.963 --> 02:44.030
Who wants to go first?
I'm gonna go first if it's all right with you.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.232
Physical? What do you
need a physical for?

02:45.299 --> 02:46.733
I can tell you what's wrong.

02:46.801 --> 02:48.100
You slouch.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.139
And you rely too much
on sarcasm.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.808
Listen. I know you like
beating people, pop.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.477
Look. This is Larry,
one of our best employees.

02:58.544 --> 03:00.379
What he's gonna do is
he's gonna walk you downstairs,

03:00.446 --> 03:01.914
out to your car.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.548
Make sure he starts it
and drives away.

03:04.616 --> 03:06.384
I get it.

03:06.451 --> 03:08.887
I've overstayed my welcome.
Yeah. Okay, pal.

03:08.954 --> 03:10.454
Take care.
Larry,

03:10.522 --> 03:13.224
did you know that I invented
the big Mac?

03:15.094 --> 03:17.162
What are these physicals
for, anyway?

03:17.229 --> 03:19.230
Oh, healthy employees mean

03:19.298 --> 03:21.631
I-I pay
lower insurance premiums.

03:21.699 --> 03:23.100
Am I getting insurance?

03:23.168 --> 03:24.868
No, that's for employees
who own something

03:24.936 --> 03:28.138
other than a dirt bike
and a full head of hair.

03:28.206 --> 03:31.341
When you look at it that way,
I am pretty lucky.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.816
Well, give it to me straight,
doc. Could you save the beard?

03:41.318 --> 03:43.752
Come in, Mike.
So are we done here, doc?

03:43.821 --> 03:46.289
Uh, actually, I'd like to speak
in private, if we could.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.424
Oh, anything you need
to tell me,

03:48.491 --> 03:50.092
you can say that
in front of Mike here.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.228
Uh, except where it concerns
this area here, right here.

03:56.598 --> 03:58.700
It actually concerns you,
Mr. Baxter.

03:58.767 --> 04:01.036
Oh. Sorry.

04:03.539 --> 04:07.675
If you're dying, I apologize.

04:07.743 --> 04:09.844
No one is dying. Okay.

04:09.911 --> 04:13.513
Feel free, unless it involves
this area here.

04:18.119 --> 04:20.921
Uh, there's been a noticeable
spike in your blood pressure

04:20.988 --> 04:22.823
compared to previous years.

04:22.891 --> 04:23.890
What?
Yeah.

04:23.958 --> 04:25.325
High blood pressure?
Yeah.

04:25.392 --> 04:27.593
Sure you got the right chart?
Yes.

04:27.661 --> 04:29.628
This guy went to grade school
with Calvin coolidge.

04:31.431 --> 04:33.032
No, no, Mike, your numbers
are a little elevated.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.035
It's very common, particularly
with men in high-stress jobs.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.703
You know what?
Come back here in seven days.

04:37.771 --> 04:39.872
I will get those numbers down.
I can do this.

04:39.939 --> 04:41.406
I like a challenge.

04:41.474 --> 04:45.443
So y-you're gonna lower stress
by doing battle with yourself?

04:46.679 --> 04:49.348
Yeah.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.316
I like it.

04:51.384 --> 04:53.252
L-listen.

04:53.319 --> 04:56.087
You need to eliminate
things that cause you stress.

04:56.154 --> 04:59.290
I live in a house
with four women.

04:59.358 --> 05:02.059
Yikes!

05:02.127 --> 05:05.897
Then, all things considered,
you're doing pretty well.

05:05.964 --> 05:09.400
Th... we do have one thing
that might help.

05:09.467 --> 05:12.903
Whenever you feel stress,
squeeze this.

05:16.374 --> 05:17.473
Wow.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.611
We live in an amazing age.

05:28.684 --> 05:31.253
No! Stop! What are you doing?
I want to see how that ends.

05:31.321 --> 05:33.222
One dance mom yells
at the other dance mom,

05:33.290 --> 05:36.825
and then they both get
yelled at by that big teacher.

05:36.893 --> 05:39.328
How do you know that?

05:39.396 --> 05:41.496
Because it's every episode.

05:41.564 --> 05:42.998
<i>Goal!</i>

05:43.066 --> 05:45.466
It's mine! It's mine! Girls!
Girls! Come on! Hey!

05:45.534 --> 05:47.402
No, no, no, no, no!
We talked about this!

05:47.469 --> 05:49.003
No yelling, more cooperat...

05:49.071 --> 05:50.905
Mandy, get off of her!
Come on.

05:50.973 --> 05:53.441
But, Eve, good way
to protect the remote.

05:53.508 --> 05:55.843
Keep it high and tight like
that, just like I taught you.

05:59.548 --> 06:01.148
Girls, we need to avoid this

06:01.215 --> 06:02.649
until your father
retakes his stress test.

06:02.716 --> 06:04.217
Honey, the only reason
I was stressed at work

06:04.285 --> 06:05.485
is 'cause dad was there,

06:05.553 --> 06:07.487
talking to people,
showing pictures,

06:07.555 --> 06:11.024
bringing up that dumb story
that he invented the big Mac.

06:11.092 --> 06:12.692
Well, I don't know, dad.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.861
A clown with binoculars.

06:14.929 --> 06:17.163
Makes a pretty compelling case.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.499
You know,
maybe he's just lonely.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.501
Yeah, we're all lonely.

06:22.569 --> 06:25.338
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

06:25.405 --> 06:28.207
I thought that was
the inner voice.

06:34.513 --> 06:36.414
You know, dad, you may
wanna consider doing yoga,

06:36.482 --> 06:38.083
because studies show that
cultures that do yoga

06:38.150 --> 06:40.218
and meditation have
different brain chemistry.

06:40.286 --> 06:42.387
I've done photo shoots
in those countries.

06:42.455 --> 06:44.255
They should spend less time
doing yoga

06:44.323 --> 06:47.525
and more time developing
their sewers.

06:47.593 --> 06:49.093
That was stressful right there.
Oh, really?

06:49.160 --> 06:50.894
A little stressful.

06:50.962 --> 06:54.664
I really believe that stress
is mind over matter.

06:59.937 --> 07:02.672
Nobody get up.
Don't get up. I got it.

07:02.740 --> 07:05.641
Don't stress yourself.
I'll get it.

07:08.045 --> 07:10.646
Hi, V. Hiya.
Bud, hey. Hi. Hi.

07:10.714 --> 07:12.281
Hey, dad. Ah, good.
You're all together.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.283
Hello. We were just
on our way to dinner,

07:14.351 --> 07:16.819
but I thought you might like to meet
my special lady... Stella.

07:16.887 --> 07:18.454
She'll be staying with me
at the apartment.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.155
She's gonna be <i>what?</i>

07:20.223 --> 07:21.589
We're living together.
Dad!

07:21.657 --> 07:22.924
We're shackin' up.
Dad!

07:22.992 --> 07:25.727
Cohabitating.
Sharing a hat rack.

07:25.794 --> 07:28.330
I got the picture.

07:28.398 --> 07:29.697
Uh, you know what?
We're... we're being rude.

07:29.765 --> 07:31.599
Hi. I'm Vanessa...
Ah, I'm so...

07:31.667 --> 07:33.235
and, uh, this is my husband Mike.
Mike.

07:33.302 --> 07:34.636
Uh, come on in, come on in.
Sit down.

07:34.703 --> 07:36.004
Meet the girls.

07:36.071 --> 07:37.271
This is, uh, Mandy...
Hi.

07:37.339 --> 07:38.406
Kristin, Eve.
Hey.

07:38.473 --> 07:40.741
I am so glad to meet you all.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.411
Bud is so proud of his family.

07:43.478 --> 07:45.179
So did you move here
from Durango?

07:45.247 --> 07:47.548
Well, of course. I gotta
keep an eye on this guy.

07:47.615 --> 07:49.383
Otherwise, he's eating
junk food,

07:49.451 --> 07:51.018
he'll stop going on his walks,

07:51.086 --> 07:54.154
and start watching smut
on the television.

07:54.221 --> 07:58.258
"Smut"?
That's "dancing with the stars."

07:58.325 --> 08:01.528
Uh, dad, are you okay?
This is how you looked

08:01.595 --> 08:04.096
the day Tim Tebow got traded.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.501
Ah, I'm good. I-I'm good.
I'm better than good.

08:09.569 --> 08:12.504
I finally get to meet...
<i>Stella.</i>

08:15.075 --> 08:16.808
Always askin' dad,
"when are you gonna bring...

08:16.876 --> 08:19.310
<i>Stella?"</i>

08:19.378 --> 08:22.547
You never said that once.

08:22.614 --> 08:24.148
You know Mike.
He's always thinking things

08:24.216 --> 08:26.117
and then not saying them.

08:28.087 --> 08:30.588
Anyhoo, uh, we better
get going.

08:30.655 --> 08:32.289
Oh. If we don't get to that
buffet line in 20 minutes,

08:32.357 --> 08:34.091
our coupon's no good.

08:35.659 --> 08:38.027
It was wonderful to meet all of you.
Thank you.

08:38.096 --> 08:39.563
- You are a beautiful family.
- Thanks.

08:39.630 --> 08:41.431
- Bud is a lucky man.
- Yeah.

08:41.499 --> 08:42.765
How lucky?

08:42.832 --> 08:44.601
Not <i>that</i> lucky.

08:53.243 --> 08:55.244
Yeah, she's horrible.

08:55.312 --> 08:56.845
What?!

08:56.913 --> 08:59.515
I'm just sayin'
what we're all thinkin'.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.250
I wasn't thinking that.

09:01.318 --> 09:03.185
No, me, neither.
I liked her.

09:03.253 --> 09:05.387
Well, you're wrong.

09:05.455 --> 09:07.522
Dad, it seems like she takes
good care of grandpa. Yeah.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.090
You know what's wrong here?

09:09.158 --> 09:12.660
Is... is you people just like
people for no reason.

09:24.905 --> 09:27.174

<i>"Tea party"...</i>

<i>on stress.</i>

10:16.388 --> 10:19.122
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>And just like it was good</i>

10:19.191 --> 10:21.292
<i>to throw the tea in the water</i>
<i>with the Boston tea party,</i>

10:21.359 --> 10:23.394
<i>it's good to throw</i>
<i>these kayaks in the water.</i>

10:23.461 --> 10:25.128
<i>Where do you find 'em?</i>
<i>Outdoor man!</i>

10:25.197 --> 10:27.330
<i>Do we sell stuff</i>
<i>that's stress-free? No!</i>

10:27.398 --> 10:29.432
<i>That's the point,</i>
<i>you worrywarts!</i>

10:38.771 --> 10:40.939
The nerve of my dad
bringing that woman over here,

10:41.006 --> 10:42.941
getting everybody all riled up.

10:45.812 --> 10:50.215
You do realize the "everybody"
in your story is just... you.

10:51.483 --> 10:52.883
I don't trust her.
Oh.

10:52.951 --> 10:54.885
I think maybe
she's just using my dad.

10:54.953 --> 10:56.186
Oh, really? For what?

10:56.254 --> 10:58.989
His, uh, coupon collection?

10:59.057 --> 11:01.492
Some of those coupons
are worth double

11:01.560 --> 11:03.527
in certain stores.

11:04.996 --> 11:07.230
Mike, honey...

11:07.297 --> 11:09.733
I know this is hard for you,
but it's a natural progression

11:09.800 --> 11:11.468
for people to move on,

11:11.535 --> 11:14.437
no matter how much
they loved their spouses.

11:14.505 --> 11:16.373
So it'd be okay if I moved on
after you go?

11:16.440 --> 11:18.875
Who says I'm going first?

11:18.942 --> 11:21.778
For the sake of this exchange.
Yeah, okay.

11:21.846 --> 11:24.179
It's okay for me to move on if you
go right now... Yes, of course.

11:24.247 --> 11:25.714
If you were to go... you're gone.
You know why?

11:25.782 --> 11:27.483
I would want you to be happy.

11:27.550 --> 11:31.387
What if it's a 25-year-old
beauty contestant?

11:31.454 --> 11:35.524
If you don't mind looking
ridiculous, you go for it.

11:35.592 --> 11:37.125
Okay. Okay, okay.
Maybe I will.

11:37.193 --> 11:38.693
So I have your blessing now.

11:38.761 --> 11:39.927
Good. Maybe that's
exactly what I'll do.

11:39.995 --> 11:42.096
You do. You do.
Yeah. That's what I'll do.

11:43.532 --> 11:45.733
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

11:48.036 --> 11:50.204
Just, uh, out of curiosity,

11:50.272 --> 11:51.238
where do you think
you're gonna meet

11:51.306 --> 11:55.141
this desperate beauty queen?

11:55.209 --> 11:57.644
Maybe in between
beauty contests...

11:57.712 --> 11:58.845
Hmm?

11:58.913 --> 12:02.382
She works for the mortuary.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.484
She did your hair and makeup.

12:11.257 --> 12:12.958
All right. All right, good.

12:13.026 --> 12:14.427
And then, uh,
that's a plan. Good.

12:14.494 --> 12:16.762
Good. That's a great plan.
Good. Okay.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.831
You date some young whore,
and I'll haunt you

12:18.899 --> 12:20.766
till you kill yourself.

12:24.905 --> 12:27.071
Good night, sweetheart.
Yeah.

12:28.541 --> 12:29.908
Love you.
Love you, too.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.150
Oh. Hey, bud.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.452
Hey, V.

12:40.519 --> 12:42.053
I didn't know you were
coming by.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.054
Yeah, Stella's
at her stretching class.

12:44.121 --> 12:45.923
I figured I'd come by
for a hot dog.

12:45.990 --> 12:49.259
She won't let me eat anything
that once had a face.

12:49.327 --> 12:51.027
Yeah, I know what she means.

12:51.095 --> 12:53.029
I was at
a Japanese restaurant once,

12:53.097 --> 12:54.731
and when they brought my fish,
it winked at me.

12:56.468 --> 12:59.635
Did you...
did you paint the moldings?

12:59.703 --> 13:02.137
Uh, it was on the to-do list
on the fridge.

13:02.205 --> 13:05.608
I also fixed the front door
and that loose step.

13:05.676 --> 13:09.211
Could you, uh, take a look
at the water heater later?

13:09.279 --> 13:11.447
Just, um...
You know, Mike's just been

13:11.515 --> 13:13.048
a little too stressed
to get to it.

13:13.116 --> 13:14.983
I'll do it right now.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.721
By the way...

13:19.789 --> 13:21.990
What did Mike think of Stella?

13:23.793 --> 13:26.862
Oh, she, uh... she... she made
a big impression.

13:28.664 --> 13:29.798
So he liked her?

13:29.866 --> 13:32.533
Ohh! Please!

13:34.168 --> 13:36.704
"Please" what? Uh...
Did he like her or not?

13:38.306 --> 13:41.509
Bud, you're killing me. Uh...

13:41.576 --> 13:43.310
Look, he...
You know Mike.

13:43.378 --> 13:45.445
He... he has a hard time
with change.

13:45.514 --> 13:49.348
I mean, he... if he could,
he'd still travel by steamship.

13:49.416 --> 13:51.450
So he hated her.

13:51.519 --> 13:53.520
No. No, no. It just...
he's... he's...

13:53.587 --> 13:55.889
he's got that
high blood pressure thing,

13:55.956 --> 14:00.159
and... and he's got to re-take
that insurance test, and...

14:00.227 --> 14:02.128
Bud. Bud.

14:02.195 --> 14:03.795
Maybe it would be better
if you just

14:03.863 --> 14:05.864
didn't bring her around here.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.098
Uh, just for a week.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.241
Hey, ed! Ed!

14:16.308 --> 14:18.609
Hey, hi, Mike.

14:18.677 --> 14:22.547
Or should I say, "aloha"?
Huh?

14:22.614 --> 14:25.416
What the hell
is with the music?

14:25.483 --> 14:27.384
We always play soothing
tropical music

14:27.452 --> 14:31.088
to relieve stress.
That's one of our things.

14:31.156 --> 14:33.524
We never play music. We don't
have a "thing" like that.

14:33.592 --> 14:36.259
We bust the balls of stores
that do stuff like this.

14:36.326 --> 14:38.995
Mr. Alzate,
we got a big problem.

14:39.063 --> 14:41.164
What's the big problem, Kyle?

14:41.231 --> 14:44.534
No problem.
How about this music?

14:44.602 --> 14:48.171
Makes me think of girls
with coconut bras.

14:52.408 --> 14:55.110
Guys, look, I know what you're
doing, and I appreciate it.

14:55.178 --> 14:56.879
You're trying to lower
my blood pressure.

14:56.947 --> 14:58.948
But when you don't tell me
what's happening,

14:59.015 --> 15:01.216
I just assume the worst.

15:01.284 --> 15:04.453
Fine. You know the shipment
of water skis?

15:04.520 --> 15:07.055
The manufacturer says we won't
get them until Christmas.

15:07.122 --> 15:09.523
All right, all right, all right.
We can deal. We can deal.

15:09.592 --> 15:11.593
Why... why do you have
to tell him this?

15:11.660 --> 15:14.128
Well, to prove it's not
the worst-case scenario...

15:14.196 --> 15:16.497
Which would be that all
four guys on the loading dock

15:16.565 --> 15:18.232
have food poisoning.

15:19.602 --> 15:20.802
Is that true?

15:20.869 --> 15:22.536
Oh, no.
Oh, good.

15:22.604 --> 15:23.536
Yes.

15:34.082 --> 15:36.083
Hey, V.
Hey, bud.

15:36.150 --> 15:37.417
What's all this?

15:37.485 --> 15:38.985
Ah, it's just a little
housewarming gift

15:39.052 --> 15:40.653
for you and Stella.

15:40.721 --> 15:42.354
I just want you to know
that if you love her,

15:42.422 --> 15:46.057
we love her, and, uh...
And Mike will learn to love her.

15:46.125 --> 15:49.160
Well, you're a little late.

15:49.228 --> 15:50.762
What?
It's not even dark out.

15:50.830 --> 15:53.331
How early do you guys
go to bed?

15:53.398 --> 15:57.035
No, I mean, Stella's gone.
I sent her back to durango.

15:57.103 --> 15:59.237
What?

15:59.304 --> 16:00.371
Why?

16:00.439 --> 16:02.205
Because you said
Mike hated her.

16:03.374 --> 16:05.009
Uh, on the plus side,

16:05.076 --> 16:07.911
I can eat anything I want.

16:07.979 --> 16:10.814
Who wants chocolate?
I do!

16:18.366 --> 16:20.300
You broke up with Stella
because of what I said?

16:20.368 --> 16:23.370
We didn't break up. I just put
her on a bus back to durango.

16:23.437 --> 16:25.605
This way she won't be around
to bug Mike.

16:25.673 --> 16:27.774
Oh, bud.
Oh, God, I feel awful.

16:27.841 --> 16:31.177
I mean, just...
You really like Stella.

16:31.245 --> 16:32.745
Mike is my son.
Yeah.

16:32.813 --> 16:34.613
I don't want
to see him stressed.

16:34.681 --> 16:36.715
Why do you think I was fixing
things around the house?

16:36.784 --> 16:39.718
I thought it was
to kiss up to me.

16:41.088 --> 16:43.355
Why would I need
to kiss up to you?

16:47.293 --> 16:49.427
Gosh, Durango's six hours away.

16:49.495 --> 16:51.997
Aren't you afraid you two
are gonna grow apart?

16:52.064 --> 16:54.332
Nah. I'll see her
when I can.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.668
Mm.
And she promised me

16:56.735 --> 16:59.437
we would "sext."

17:09.079 --> 17:11.115
What is that, by the way?

17:17.855 --> 17:19.422
What a surprise.
Come on in.

17:19.489 --> 17:22.425
Hey, honey. Uh, we need
to talk about your father.

17:22.492 --> 17:24.060
Is he all right?
He's okay.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.394
Sit down. What's up?
Uh, he's great.

17:25.462 --> 17:30.433
Um... I, uh... I may have
caused a bit of a-a thing.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.334
What kind of a thing?
An expensive thing?

17:32.401 --> 17:34.636
No, no...

17:34.704 --> 17:38.207
Your father asked me
if you liked Stella...

17:38.274 --> 17:40.108
Yeah?
And he was relentless.

17:40.176 --> 17:42.811
Oh, please.
And I finally said "no."

17:42.879 --> 17:46.648
Why did you say that?
Because, Mike... because it is the truth.

17:46.716 --> 17:48.850
So? Since when
do I tell the truth?

17:48.917 --> 17:50.818
So he sent her back.

17:50.886 --> 17:53.921
"I put her
on the bus back to durango."

17:56.424 --> 17:59.693
You make my dad
sound like Mike Ditka.

18:01.296 --> 18:03.364
Anyway, I just... I feel terrible.

18:03.431 --> 18:04.998
You know what? Get these
chocolates away from me.

18:05.066 --> 18:06.799
I can't... you know, this
is why men don't talk.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.035
It just leads into trouble.

18:09.103 --> 18:14.241
Men don't talk because
they are emotionally lazy.

18:14.308 --> 18:17.810
This is a good time to have that lecture, huh?
All right, you know what?

18:17.879 --> 18:20.846
I... honey, I know this was my fault.
Yeah, it's your fault.

18:20.914 --> 18:23.115
But you can fix this...
I'm not gonna fix it. You're the one...

18:23.183 --> 18:25.484
if you would just have a real conversation...
Don't... don't put this...

18:25.551 --> 18:27.353
with your father,
then you could work through

18:27.420 --> 18:30.890
whatever it is that you guys
need to work through.

18:30.957 --> 18:33.825
You took a bite out of
every one of these chocolates.

18:43.035 --> 18:45.736
Hey, dad.
Son. Come on in.

18:45.804 --> 18:47.872
What's going on here?

18:47.940 --> 18:51.842
ESPN 1, ESPN 2, and <i>deportes.</i>

18:53.477 --> 18:56.446
What, do you run a little
sports book, Uncle junior?

18:56.514 --> 18:59.983
I had, uh... I had a few TVs
left over from the build.

19:00.051 --> 19:03.287
But I can cover any action
up to $200 a bet.

19:03.354 --> 19:04.888
What brings you here?

19:04.956 --> 19:06.390
Well, uh...

19:06.457 --> 19:07.990
I had a little
conversation with Vanessa.

19:08.058 --> 19:12.295
Oh, God, it's an epidemic.

19:12.362 --> 19:15.664
Dad, I just came by to tell you
I appreciate the concern.

19:15.732 --> 19:18.134
All right. Don't go
to pieces on me.

19:18.201 --> 19:21.070
I got a quiniela on this
next harness race.

19:21.138 --> 19:22.905
Shut 'em off for a minute,
will you, please?

19:27.676 --> 19:31.746
I think we should talk
about Stella.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.516
Look.

19:35.584 --> 19:37.919
It must be hard for you
to see me

19:37.987 --> 19:41.121
with someone
that's not your mother.

19:41.189 --> 19:45.492
Um... it's hard
not seeing mom, period.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.294
And whenever I see you,

19:47.362 --> 19:51.165
I half expect mom to come
in the room right after you.

19:54.135 --> 19:56.735
Your mother's been dead
for five years.

19:56.803 --> 19:59.072
If your mother walked in
behind me, I'd...

19:59.139 --> 20:01.540
Crap my pants.

20:07.982 --> 20:11.050
I think you should call Stella
and get her back here.

20:12.318 --> 20:13.485
You'd be all right with that?

20:13.552 --> 20:15.354
Mnh-mnh.

20:15.421 --> 20:19.757
No. But, dad,
I want you to be happy.

20:23.196 --> 20:26.365
Well, at least you don't
want me to die lonely.

20:26.432 --> 20:28.866
No. In a perfect world,

20:28.933 --> 20:32.069
you should have died
the day after mom.

20:35.107 --> 20:36.507
Fair enough.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.292
So your
blood pressure went down

20:46.360 --> 20:47.961
as soon as you made up
with your father.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.631
Huh. Who would have
seen that coming?

20:50.698 --> 20:53.066
You know, what gets
my blood pressure back up

20:53.134 --> 20:55.067
is you gloating.

20:56.837 --> 20:58.303
I have some music
to put you in the mood.

20:58.371 --> 20:59.939
Listen to this.

21:04.711 --> 21:07.513
In the mood for what?
Poi?

21:07.580 --> 21:09.882
Ed was playing this at work,
and I hated it.

21:09.950 --> 21:11.482
But it started getting
into my head,

21:11.550 --> 21:13.051
and now I kinda like it.

21:13.119 --> 21:14.919
I'm in the mood
for a whole pig.

21:16.355 --> 21:18.657
Not exactly what a wife
wants to hear

21:18.724 --> 21:21.092
right as she's taking off
her robe, but...

21:25.798 --> 21:27.064
Mmm.

21:27.132 --> 21:29.800
Good night, honey.
Good night, baby.
