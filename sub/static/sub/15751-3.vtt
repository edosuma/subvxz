12:25.580 --> 12:26.330
-Hey.
JOSH: Give it.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.030
ALI: I want it.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.310
-Hey.

12:28.310 --> 12:30.730
Hey, hey.

12:30.730 --> 12:32.440
I don't want to hear
a peep out of you.

12:35.690 --> 12:36.380
-(IN UNISON) Peep.

12:40.710 --> 12:41.440
-Lookie, lookie, look.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.770
These are the moon rocks.

12:43.770 --> 12:45.760
-Yeah, that looks like crack.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.110
-No.

12:47.110 --> 12:48.330
My friend gave them to me.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.920
She had some extra,
they're amazing.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.120
They're supposed
to be better than E

12:52.120 --> 12:53.340
because they're,
like, pure MDMA.

12:56.530 --> 12:59.020
-Yeah, this shit sits
in your spine and--

12:59.020 --> 13:00.650
-No, no, no, no,
no.That stuff is pure

13:00.650 --> 13:03.530
and-- and there's like
a really easy come down.

13:03.530 --> 13:04.940
The government even
gives it to Iraq

13:04.940 --> 13:06.460
vets who are
recovering from PTSD.

13:06.460 --> 13:07.160
It's like--

13:07.160 --> 13:09.410
-We should definitely do
what the government does.

13:09.410 --> 13:13.640
-Uncle Sam wants you
to roll with Ali.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.340
-That's cute.

13:14.340 --> 13:15.180
-Come on.

13:15.180 --> 13:16.530
Should we ask Mike?

13:19.240 --> 13:22.320
-Hey, Mike, wanna
get high with us?

13:22.320 --> 13:23.190
-What you got?

13:29.690 --> 13:30.470
-Hey, Josh.

13:30.470 --> 13:31.170
-Hey.

13:31.170 --> 13:31.940
Gary's looking for you.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.220
He's in the conference room.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.170
-OK.

13:34.170 --> 13:36.290
MALE VOICE: The Jew's harp
is actually just technical,

13:36.290 --> 13:36.990
you know?

13:36.990 --> 13:37.250
-Hey.

13:37.250 --> 13:37.970
-You got a sec?

13:37.970 --> 13:39.570
-Um, I'm kind of in a hurry.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.460
Ryan's here.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.460
We're going to talk to the
remaster with Kaya and Margaux.

13:42.460 --> 13:42.960
-Yeah, yeah.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.010
No, this'll just be a minute.

13:44.010 --> 13:46.190
Pop a squat because I want you
to meet, uh, the Drug Mules.

13:46.190 --> 13:46.890
-What's up?

13:46.890 --> 13:47.590
-Hi, what's up?

13:47.590 --> 13:49.270
-Uh, I reached out to you
about them a while ago.

13:49.270 --> 13:51.400
I-- I caught them at South
By and I just went 8 balls.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.190
It's totally your wheelhouse,
by the way, brother.

13:53.190 --> 13:55.890
-Um, I'm in the middle of
setting up a tour right now,

13:55.890 --> 13:58.330
so I highly doubt I'm
going to have the time--

13:58.330 --> 14:01.650
-So actually, um, I'm going to
have Glenda wrangle Glitterish

14:01.650 --> 14:03.950
for a minute-- just a little
moving and shaking real quick,

14:03.950 --> 14:06.310
and I'm going to have you
jump in with these guys

14:06.310 --> 14:10.040
and, um, we'll talk about
the details later, OK?

14:10.040 --> 14:12.490
-I think we're going to
about it right fucking now.

14:12.490 --> 14:14.900
Is-- is this about Kaya?

14:14.900 --> 14:16.380
What did she say to you?

14:16.380 --> 14:20.090
Because if she told you to fire
me, I've got a right to know.

14:20.090 --> 14:20.790
-Uh-huh.

14:20.790 --> 14:21.520
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

14:21.520 --> 14:21.800
-Sit down.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.370
Everything's actually
totally chill.

14:23.370 --> 14:24.450
-Barry, what did she say?

14:24.450 --> 14:25.040
-Why don't you take a
look at those bagels

14:25.040 --> 14:26.910
and you need to get to know
that fruit salad real fast.

14:26.910 --> 14:27.940
-Hey, Barry, sit the fuck down.

14:27.940 --> 14:29.210
-We're not having
this talk right now.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.170
-What did she say to you?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.640
-She said she didn't
feel fucking safe.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.810
Can we talk about
it fucking later?

14:32.810 --> 14:33.920
-She doesn't feel safe with me?

14:33.920 --> 14:35.030
-Can we talk about this
fucking later, bro?

14:35.030 --> 14:35.940
-What does that even mean?

14:35.940 --> 14:37.790
I'm the one that
discovered Glitterish.

14:37.790 --> 14:40.100
I'm the one that was there
the night they played the Roxy

14:40.100 --> 14:42.630
the first time and
you were the one

14:42.630 --> 14:43.810
who didn't want to sign them.

14:43.810 --> 14:46.630
I protected her from
you and now you're

14:46.630 --> 14:50.250
going to fucking fire me
from the-- fuck that shit!

15:01.500 --> 15:02.980
-You just got fired, bro.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.160
-Hi.

15:28.160 --> 15:28.860
-Hey.

15:32.720 --> 15:36.330
I've got an hour, a
whole hour just for you.

15:36.330 --> 15:37.880
I cancelled the Grubman thing.

15:37.880 --> 15:42.140
I just made up some bullshit.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.450
So do you want to tell
me what's going on?

15:44.450 --> 15:49.380
-I don't know, just-- I-- I'm
just like riddled with anxiety

15:49.380 --> 15:50.080
lately.

15:50.080 --> 15:55.440
It's like-- it's kind of
like anxious exhaustion.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.910
I heard this guy call
it that on the radio.

15:57.910 --> 16:02.440
It's like I'm
overwhelmed all the time.

16:02.440 --> 16:06.240
-You're overwhelmed
all the time-- how?

16:06.240 --> 16:09.680
How are you overwhelmed because
we have Sylvia full time?

16:09.680 --> 16:11.640
-I don't know if you're
actually aware, but, um,

16:11.640 --> 16:17.320
I manage Sylvia, and, uh, and
I'm on, like, four committees

16:17.320 --> 16:19.800
at Ivanhoe and the parent
outreach at the j--

16:19.800 --> 16:22.270
I'm actually training
for a triathlon

16:22.270 --> 16:25.410
to swim in the ocean to
raise money for breast cancer

16:25.410 --> 16:27.890
because I hope one
day if I have breast

16:27.890 --> 16:30.200
cancer somebody swims for me.

16:30.200 --> 16:35.350
-Babe, are you OK?

16:35.350 --> 16:36.770
Do you feel OK?

16:36.770 --> 16:39.750
-Oh my God.

16:39.750 --> 16:43.690
I don't want you
to be mad at me.

16:43.690 --> 16:46.000
-I'm not mad.

16:46.000 --> 16:46.700
-OK.

16:46.700 --> 16:52.000
You know that coop in
college that I worked at?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.280
I didn't tell you that
I also lived there.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.350
-I think you told me that.

16:56.350 --> 16:56.710
-I did?

16:56.710 --> 16:57.070
OK.

16:57.070 --> 16:58.790
Well, I-- what I didn't
tell you that I-- that

16:58.790 --> 17:03.620
I lived there with-- with Tammy.

17:03.620 --> 17:04.320
Oh.

17:08.550 --> 17:12.870
Like in my-- in my-- in my room,
with her-- in my bed, actually.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.350
I was in love with her, Len.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.280
I am in love with her.

17:31.850 --> 17:36.160
-I'm going to call Doctor
Schaumberg because we haven't

17:36.160 --> 17:37.230
talked to anyone in a long time.

17:37.230 --> 17:37.940
-No, Len.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.040
-Yeah, I'm calling
her right now.

17:39.040 --> 17:39.950
-No.

17:39.950 --> 17:42.410
This doesn't-- this has
nothing to do with--

17:42.410 --> 17:45.100
this isn't us, this is me.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.030
Len--

17:46.030 --> 17:47.050
-We're going to talk to her.

17:47.050 --> 17:47.460
-It's me.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.240
-I'll get us an appointment
and we can talk to her.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.800
-Len, it's me.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.500
It's me.

17:54.860 --> 17:57.430
-You're not allowed
to do this, you know?

18:01.050 --> 18:02.430
-I don't know how not to.

18:09.340 --> 18:10.600
-I just came from Barry's.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.930
-I'm going to have
to call you back, OK?

18:11.930 --> 18:13.100
-What is going on?

18:13.100 --> 18:15.790
Tell me you did not
tell him to fire me.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.660
-Yeah, I told him to fire you.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.470
I mean my God, what
was I supposed to do?

18:19.470 --> 18:21.750
I mean you wouldn't drop
the whole baby thing.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.020
-Yeah, it's a big deal.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.470
I don't know if you
can appreciate this,

18:25.470 --> 18:27.070
but this is a fucking
big deal for me.

18:27.070 --> 18:28.790
I've been fucking
shit up my whole life.

18:28.790 --> 18:30.370
I'm trying to do
the right thing.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.680
-By right thing you mean
we live in the mountains

18:32.680 --> 18:35.360
and I run around with milk
spewing out of my boobs?

18:35.360 --> 18:36.060
-OK, that--

18:36.060 --> 18:37.360
-Because you care
about me so much

18:37.360 --> 18:38.130
-OK, that was a stupid.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.140
It was a stupid idea.

18:39.140 --> 18:39.840
I'm sorry.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.600
-Josh, this is only the
second time you've even

18:41.600 --> 18:45.220
been to my house, OK, and it's
not like I live in Venice.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.760
Echo Park and Silver
Lake are-- I don't even

18:47.760 --> 18:49.180
know where one stops
and the other starts.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.170
-OK, Rampart.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.380
Look, you never asked
me to come here.

18:52.380 --> 18:54.160
I would come here
if you asked me to.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.220
-A normal guy just comes.

18:56.220 --> 18:56.960
-OK.

18:56.960 --> 18:57.840
I'm here now.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.760
I'm here now and I
will continue to come.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.000
-I'm going in and
you're not invited.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.230
-Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

19:02.230 --> 19:02.930
OK.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.210
Kaya, how did this happen?

19:08.210 --> 19:10.720
OK, look, we have
a baby in there,

19:10.720 --> 19:13.360
and I don't think you realise
how important that is.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.840
-I already had the abortion.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.790
-When?

19:26.790 --> 19:28.000
-Yesterday.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.520
I took like four Tylenol
and I was totally fine.

19:45.710 --> 19:46.880
-I couldn't do it.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.040
I just chickened out with Josh.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.790
-I'm really sorry about that.

19:49.790 --> 19:50.800
Boys are the hardest.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.670
-Boys are the hardest.

19:51.670 --> 19:52.200
-They are.

19:52.200 --> 19:52.900
-Why?

19:52.900 --> 19:56.900
-Well, because they-- they
never stop really seeing you

19:56.900 --> 20:00.680
as their father and girls
are just easier that way.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.980
I think they're more sensitive.

20:02.980 --> 20:04.460
Why don't we go out?

20:04.460 --> 20:05.390
-Where?

20:05.390 --> 20:06.920
-Well, you know, we'll
find some place in Weho

20:06.920 --> 20:09.300
and we'll just go drink.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.390
-I have to come out to Ali.

20:11.390 --> 20:12.930
Nothing feels right
until I do that.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.190
-Mike, I need three
glasses of water, please.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.910
-Shit's about to get weird.

20:26.910 --> 20:31.630
-OK, if I get too crazy, you
guys have to be my guides.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.980
-Really?

20:32.980 --> 20:35.080
You think you can
handle the two of us?

20:35.080 --> 20:35.890
-Oh, please.

20:35.890 --> 20:36.920
You know I've been working out.

20:36.920 --> 20:41.120
-Oh, we got us a hot one.

20:41.120 --> 20:41.960
-For you.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.120
-Bottoms up, freaks.

21:00.170 --> 21:04.310
-Um, guys, that was actually
just cyanide that we took.

21:04.310 --> 21:05.230
I'm just kidding.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.080
TAMMY (ON PHONE): Hey,
you've reached Tammy Cashman.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.060
You know what to do so do it.

21:11.060 --> 21:11.850
[BEEP]

21:11.850 --> 21:14.990
Babe, I did it.

21:14.990 --> 21:15.890
I left Len.

21:15.890 --> 21:16.860
Oh my God.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.140
You know what-- I actually,
I think it's going to be OK.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.050
I think he's going to be OK.

21:21.050 --> 21:24.200
I just have to tell the kids.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.030
I'm-- I'm taking them
to my dad's tomorrow.

21:26.030 --> 21:26.960
Should I tell them tomorrow?

21:26.960 --> 21:28.240
Oh, God, I don't know.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.270
Where are you, honey?

21:29.270 --> 21:30.200
I need to talk to you.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.160
Will you call me, please?

21:44.770 --> 21:48.710
-I feel like I'm
spooning a bear.

21:48.710 --> 21:50.690
This is how cave women felt.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.050
-You know what you look like?

22:00.050 --> 22:01.670
A cat.

22:01.670 --> 22:03.540
A feral cat.

22:03.540 --> 22:05.680
I had a cat when I was a kid.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.180
-We used to be kids.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.180
Derek, Derek.

22:21.180 --> 22:24.550
You're too far away from us.

22:24.550 --> 22:25.350
Why are you so far away?

22:25.350 --> 22:31.990
-I don't know, I'm just
so fucking thirsty.

22:31.990 --> 22:33.440
-You should kiss me.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.380
I'm 78% water.

22:41.670 --> 22:43.120
Hi, Mike.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.090
You're making me naked.

22:46.090 --> 22:48.510
Mike's making me naked.

22:48.510 --> 22:49.970
-Ooh, is that my pussy?

22:49.970 --> 22:52.890
-Yeah, that's your pussy.

22:52.890 --> 22:54.830
-Wait, where are you going?

22:54.830 --> 22:56.590
-I'm going to give
Mike your pussy

22:56.590 --> 22:59.180
so then Mike has Derek's
pussy because I'm

22:59.180 --> 23:00.590
a vessel for you guys.

23:00.590 --> 23:01.560
-What?

23:01.560 --> 23:04.970
-So that you have
to be in this room

23:04.970 --> 23:07.200
fucking each other
because that's--

23:07.200 --> 23:07.900
-No.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.050
- --what really
want to be doing.

23:09.050 --> 23:10.350
-No.

23:10.350 --> 23:12.770
-You really want to
be loving each other.

23:12.770 --> 23:14.950
-What?

23:14.950 --> 23:17.650
-This is your bitch.

23:17.650 --> 23:18.650
-Is this my woman?

23:23.120 --> 23:25.600
-But why do I have to leave?

23:37.070 --> 23:38.130
I hope Mike's OK.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.050
Is Mike OK?

23:42.430 --> 23:43.130
Bye.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.000
Hi.

23:51.910 --> 23:53.040
-Hello.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.590
-I love your car.

23:54.590 --> 23:57.140
It's so pretty.

23:57.140 --> 24:00.720
I think this is what it must
feel like to be in the womb,

24:00.720 --> 24:03.810
but you probably can't
do this with your arms.

24:03.810 --> 24:07.070
You have such a pretty face.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.440
Where do you come from?

24:09.440 --> 24:11.520
-I come from Armenia.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.930
-Oh, is your family there?

24:13.930 --> 24:14.630
-Yes.

24:14.630 --> 24:18.100
-Are you sad about that?

24:18.100 --> 24:20.690
-Being alive is being sad.

24:25.110 --> 24:27.170
-Can I have a candy bar?

24:27.170 --> 24:28.480
-Yes, of course.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.010
They're for customers like you.

24:31.010 --> 24:33.770
My business card
is back there, too.

24:33.770 --> 24:36.900
Maybe I can take you to the
airport or something sometime,

24:36.900 --> 24:38.980
you know?

24:38.980 --> 24:40.590
Your name is Tigran.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.950
You would just go
and buy these candies

24:47.950 --> 24:50.180
just for the people
who ride in your car?

24:50.180 --> 24:51.320
-Of course.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.330
I just go to the Costco.

24:53.330 --> 24:56.830
-That is so
incredibly nice of you

24:56.830 --> 24:59.790
that you go all the way to the
Costco to buy us these candies.

24:59.790 --> 25:03.700
And I am so sorry about
the Armenian genocide.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.170

27:18.530 --> 27:20.970
-Thank you, Tigran.

27:20.970 --> 27:24.450
-Listen, I hope you will
give me five stars, eh?

27:24.450 --> 27:28.640
You got it-- five
stars all the way.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.630
-Be careful.

-Hi, Daddy.

28:16.550 --> 28:18.830
You want to come visit me?

28:18.830 --> 28:21.080
Yes, now is the perfect time.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.420
I would love that.
