WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:01.206
I never hit your mum.

00:01.273 --> 00:03.711
As your father, I thought
you might already know the answer.

00:03.788 --> 00:06.477
He said he'd seen Eliot
climbing into the house

00:06.554 --> 00:08.009
through a first-floor window.

00:08.086 --> 00:10.889
Tell me the truth, Eliot,
or I can't continue to protect you.

00:10.966 --> 00:13.171
I was driving. I hit something
and I went out to look for it

00:13.248 --> 00:14.676
and I couldn't find anything.
That's it.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.169
I'm losing the plot.

00:16.245 --> 00:18.271
You're tired.
It just makes everything seem worse.

00:18.348 --> 00:19.536
Any sensitive stuff inside?

00:19.613 --> 00:21.952
Jesus, there's one site here
that's found a photo of him.

00:22.029 --> 00:24.637
If you need to take me off the case,
I'll understand completely.

00:24.714 --> 00:26.997
For the record,
I very much want to stay.

00:27.074 --> 00:28.752
Urgh!
Peter Carr's died.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.473
And I am sorry you're going through
whatever it is you're going through.

00:32.549 --> 00:34.129
I love you, sweetheart.
I swear,

00:34.206 --> 00:36.600
I didn't hurt Hayley Reid.
I never even met her.

00:36.677 --> 00:39.415
When might the police know
that you're not a suspect any more?

00:39.492 --> 00:40.452
I don't know.

00:40.529 --> 00:43.166
If she encountered anyone, the
more likely it would be Tim Finch.

00:43.243 --> 00:46.514
The ticket was issued at 6:20am,
six miles outside of Middenham.

00:46.591 --> 00:48.051
Timothy Finch, I'm arresting you

00:48.128 --> 00:50.020
on suspicion of the murder
of Hayley Reid.

00:50.097 --> 00:52.065
We have authority
to search your premises

00:52.142 --> 00:55.257
under Section 32 of the Police
And Criminal Evidence Act.

00:55.349 --> 00:56.874
In his cellar we found a necklace

00:56.951 --> 00:58.632
with hair still attached
to the clasp,

00:58.740 --> 01:01.599
a scrunchie and a pair of knickers.

02:10.601 --> 02:12.006
That's a lot of manpower.

02:12.083 --> 02:14.405
And really, what are you even hoping
to find 18 years on?

02:14.482 --> 02:15.309
<i>I don't-I don't know.</i>

02:15.386 --> 02:17.850
But this has to be the most likely
location of her murder.

02:17.927 --> 02:20.096
And Middenham Woods, near the
Spinney, have never been searched.

02:20.173 --> 02:23.819
- This can't end like the Walker case.
- It won't.

02:25.457 --> 02:27.366
I'll see what Hampshire
will give us.

02:27.463 --> 02:28.913
Thank you, sir.

02:30.630 --> 02:32.942
You don't have to make every call.
I am here, you know.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.381
Thank you, it's just...

02:34.458 --> 02:36.428
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. Is that Jess?

02:36.505 --> 02:38.358
- Yes.
- Jess, it's Cass Stuart.

02:38.435 --> 02:40.026
There's been a development

02:40.103 --> 02:44.022
and we wondered how you and,
or your mum...

02:44.156 --> 02:46.858
..would feel about
coming up to London this afternoon.

02:48.521 --> 02:50.905
Can we just cut to the chase here?
What are you saying?

02:50.982 --> 02:52.897
That you think Dad
is some sort of psychopath

02:52.974 --> 02:54.215
and the police have got
the right man?

02:54.292 --> 02:55.702
I don't know. I just...

02:55.889 --> 02:57.308
I saw something in Mum's eyes

02:57.385 --> 02:59.480
- that I've never seen before.
- Oh, please

02:59.557 --> 03:02.239
And I believed her, Claire.
I'm sorry, but I did.

03:02.825 --> 03:04.365
It happens, you know?

03:04.442 --> 03:05.866
I've read stories in the paper,

03:05.943 --> 03:09.626
where people turn out to have
completely hidden other lives.

03:09.703 --> 03:11.219
It happens.
It does.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.756
But just because
your ex turned out

03:13.833 --> 03:15.682
to be a lying, cheating,
evil bastard,

03:15.759 --> 03:17.668
it doesn't mean that all men are,
Emma.

03:17.745 --> 03:19.910
Carol, is there anything
in what I'm saying

03:19.987 --> 03:21.572
that sets off any alarm bells?

03:21.649 --> 03:23.531
Is there any reason
you can think of

03:23.608 --> 03:26.376
that the police would be
so interested in our father?

03:27.799 --> 03:28.829
No.

03:30.764 --> 03:32.811
I think you're lying.
I think you know something.

03:32.888 --> 03:34.370
- I think you should go.
- Carol, we need

03:34.447 --> 03:35.499
- to know.
- No! We

03:35.576 --> 03:38.591
should be pulling together,
not exorcising personal demons.

03:38.668 --> 03:40.093
So, just go.

03:40.308 --> 03:42.418
Em, please, just go.

03:51.090 --> 03:53.155
Hi, it's Eliot.
Leave a message.

04:02.442 --> 04:05.148
Hi, this is Amy.
Please leave a...

04:23.564 --> 04:26.308
Do you remember our theatre trips
to London?

04:27.519 --> 04:29.562
We used to love those.

04:29.639 --> 04:31.605
Mama Mia, Miss Saigon...

04:31.682 --> 04:33.327
That brilliant thing
at the Royal Court.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.189
Oh, my God,
with all the swearing!

04:35.266 --> 04:37.297
Yeah, that's why we loved it.

04:37.526 --> 04:39.605
Did we go for milkshakes afterwards?

04:39.682 --> 04:42.205
Hales did that frothy lip thing
she used to do.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.366
We were all in hysterics.

04:52.639 --> 04:55.121
I'm so sorry, Jessie...

04:55.459 --> 04:57.169
..for your loss.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.918
Well, the box is mine.
And I've had it decades.

05:13.995 --> 05:15.394
Since I was a kid, I think.

05:15.559 --> 05:18.863
It's more what was inside
that we're interested in.

05:19.588 --> 05:23.512
Well, I think I bought the necklace
and the scrunchy

05:23.599 --> 05:27.238
at a fete we went to in Middenham,
as presents for the girls.

05:27.685 --> 05:29.332
A fete at New Year?

05:29.776 --> 05:33.277
Oh, sorry, no. I don't mean
the millennium holiday.

05:33.354 --> 05:35.666
We went back down there
several times over the years,

05:35.743 --> 05:38.837
just me and the girls,
after Derran and I separated.

05:38.914 --> 05:39.948
Right.

05:40.026 --> 05:42.211
And do you remember
which holiday

05:42.288 --> 05:45.559
you think
you might have bought them?

05:46.081 --> 05:47.504
Not really.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.212
But it was a fete,

05:49.289 --> 05:52.156
so it's most likely the summer one,
which was,

05:52.233 --> 05:57.902
erm... a year and half
after the millennium holiday, so...

05:58.529 --> 05:59.659
..2001.

05:59.877 --> 06:02.152
And what, you bought the...

06:02.389 --> 06:06.246
..necklace and the scrunchy
together?

06:06.323 --> 06:07.662
I don't remember.

06:07.739 --> 06:10.879
Why do you think
these where all in this box, then,

06:10.956 --> 06:12.251
in your cellar,

06:12.328 --> 06:13.776
with the knickers?

06:14.151 --> 06:16.509
I mean, I can offer you
an explanation.

06:16.586 --> 06:21.012
But given why I'm here, I suspect
you'll find it rather far-fetched.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.284
Try me.

06:24.495 --> 06:28.332
Well,
the girls often used old knickers

06:28.409 --> 06:29.624
to tie their hair back,

06:29.701 --> 06:32.337
if they didn't have a band
or a scrunchy.

06:32.414 --> 06:34.322
It was a sort of family joke.

06:34.399 --> 06:37.540
But it also meant
that they often got, erm...

06:37.617 --> 06:40.860
..just grouped together
in various places around the house.

06:40.937 --> 06:41.983
So...

06:42.199 --> 06:45.230
..I'm guessing, that I...

06:45.338 --> 06:47.038
..forgot to give the presents
to the girls

06:47.115 --> 06:50.437
and then, at some point, all this
stuff just got put in this box

06:50.514 --> 06:53.058
and then tidied away downstairs.

06:53.299 --> 06:55.597
I'm sorry,
that's all I can offer you.

06:56.879 --> 06:59.525
Do you understand
why these objects might concern us?

06:59.602 --> 07:00.934
I think so, yes.

07:01.219 --> 07:03.004
Because they...

07:03.596 --> 07:05.023
..they look like trophies to us.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.996
I understand your thinking.
But, please...

07:08.156 --> 07:11.246
..let me assure you,
these can't be Hayley Reid's...

07:11.479 --> 07:14.512
..for the very simple reason
that I never met Hayley Reid.

07:19.799 --> 07:21.073
Mila!

07:29.322 --> 07:30.432
Mila!

07:31.017 --> 07:32.057
It's me!

07:32.892 --> 07:34.679
Where is West End
Central Police Station?

07:34.756 --> 07:37.277
- Yeah, just down there on the right.
- Thank you.

07:40.833 --> 07:43.879
If, at any point, you want to stop,
just say the word.

07:49.424 --> 07:52.418
I think it's very unlikely
this was Hayley's.

07:52.495 --> 07:53.565
OK.

07:53.674 --> 07:57.129
I know she had long hair
in the missing posters...

07:57.329 --> 08:00.832
..but that was just
the most recent photo we had of her.

08:00.995 --> 08:05.497
Cos, actually, about three weeks
before she disappeared,

08:05.651 --> 08:07.722
she had her hair cut in to a bob,

08:07.799 --> 08:09.970
so she wouldn't have been wearing
a scrunchy.

08:10.047 --> 08:11.050
Right.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.799
OK. No problem.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.119
No.

08:25.251 --> 08:26.902
I don't think so. I....

08:26.979 --> 08:29.516
- No, I don't think they were hers.
- OK.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.188
Hayley was
all about colour and fun.

08:32.265 --> 08:33.491
She would have never worn knickers

08:33.568 --> 08:35.136
- like these...
- OK.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.149
And lastly...

08:46.024 --> 08:47.219
I'm sorry.

08:47.578 --> 08:49.525
I don't recognise that, either.

08:49.888 --> 08:53.275
Aside from neither of us
recognising it,

08:53.352 --> 08:56.306
Um, Hayley was
a pretty devout atheist.

08:56.383 --> 08:58.613
I never saw her wearing a cross.

08:59.618 --> 09:02.932
I'm sorry, it's... No, it's nothing
to be sorry about, nothing at all.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.695
So, is there other stuff
with this man?

09:08.772 --> 09:10.658
Like, are you near,
do you think?

09:12.118 --> 09:14.406
I don't want to give you false hope,
Jess,

09:14.483 --> 09:17.408
but...
I do feel we're near, yes.

09:17.485 --> 09:20.218
Now... we just need to find
that concrete link.

09:20.295 --> 09:22.517
- OK.
- Hard evidence.

09:23.094 --> 09:25.404
Well, we have faith in you.
You know that, don't you?

09:25.481 --> 09:28.596
And I appreciate it
very much.

09:30.431 --> 09:31.994
I'll call you.
Yeah.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.430
Thank you.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.506
I wore a crucifix
when I was 16

09:41.597 --> 09:43.270
cos Axl Rose wore one.

09:43.347 --> 09:45.214
I'd never been inside a church
in my life.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.747
- Absolutely. We test the lot.
- Yeah.

10:23.079 --> 10:24.726
Please leave a message at the tone.

10:25.836 --> 10:28.249
Hey, do you want to give your mum
a fucking ring sometime?

10:33.852 --> 10:35.336
Mrs Faruk?

10:35.507 --> 10:39.040
Hello. So all the officers from the
Landmark case have left for the day.

10:39.117 --> 10:41.280
But I can leave a message for them
to call you.

10:41.357 --> 10:42.806
Will they be in tomorrow?

10:42.929 --> 10:44.632
I don't
know their movements, I'm afraid.

10:44.709 --> 10:47.024
- But if I take your...
- I'll come back tomorrow.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.587
I need to see them face to face.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.367
Thank you.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.766
The results of the tests
have come through.

11:04.843 --> 11:06.304
And?

11:06.545 --> 11:07.913
They're not Hayley Reid's.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.578
Oh, for...

11:09.928 --> 11:11.998
But they have found a match.

11:13.828 --> 11:15.476
What do you mean,
they've found a match?

11:15.553 --> 11:17.069
What match?

11:17.875 --> 11:21.335
To the DNA of a 14-year-old girl
called Alison Baldwin,

11:21.412 --> 11:23.938
who went missing in June 1997.

11:24.359 --> 11:26.556
Her body was found
two days later,

11:26.633 --> 11:29.868
in woodland, minus underwear.

11:31.164 --> 11:33.337
She'd been raped and strangled.

11:45.234 --> 11:49.501
So, like Hayley, Alison
disappeared on a walk through woods

11:49.593 --> 11:51.906
flanking a small village
six miles from Cambridge.

11:51.983 --> 11:55.696
She was found in undergrowth...

11:56.007 --> 11:59.110
..by a police search two days later.

12:00.093 --> 12:01.596
Her father's dead now.

12:01.673 --> 12:05.243
But her mum, who I just spoke to
on the phone, is going to come up

12:05.388 --> 12:09.845
to have a look at the items
we found in Finch's house.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.126
So my guess, if he's smart,

12:12.203 --> 12:16.899
he'll still say that he bought these
items at a Middenham summer fete.

12:16.976 --> 12:19.876
And he's just the innocent victim
of a coincidence.

12:19.953 --> 12:21.481
Which is, obviously,
very hard to believe,

12:21.558 --> 12:26.751
but which a defence
could certainly argue was possible.

12:26.962 --> 12:30.563
So, what we need, what I need,
from you...

12:30.914 --> 12:36.837
..is to find other connections
between him and Alison Baldwin.

12:36.914 --> 12:39.465
I believe they exist,
because I believe, in my gut,

12:39.542 --> 12:41.418
that Finch killed them both.

12:43.218 --> 12:46.602
The files that we collated when
we were trying to identify Hayley,

12:46.679 --> 12:48.706
- have they gone back yet?
- All still here.

12:48.783 --> 12:50.029
Good.

12:50.234 --> 12:52.171
And can we get a message out
to all forces

12:52.248 --> 12:55.444
for information
on all murders with a similar MO

12:55.726 --> 13:00.165
of females between the ages of 14...

13:00.805 --> 13:03.759
..and 20...

13:05.570 --> 13:08.220
..from 1975...

13:09.000 --> 13:10.767
..to the present day.

13:11.148 --> 13:14.472
We want to know about
every unsolved case,

13:14.549 --> 13:17.852
whether there's any
remaining forensic evidence.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.423
Yeah. Erm...

13:23.586 --> 13:25.954
You've all seen Hayley's family.

13:28.604 --> 13:31.354
And we'll meet Alison's
later today.

13:31.909 --> 13:34.629
So... So you'll know
what their lives been reduced to.

13:34.706 --> 13:37.243
Let's find this evidence for them.

13:41.346 --> 13:43.056
OK, guys, heads down.

13:43.606 --> 13:45.116
Let's get cracking.

15:00.059 --> 15:01.191
Guv!

15:01.337 --> 15:03.127
I've found something!

15:14.134 --> 15:17.034
What does the name Alison Baldwin
mean to you?

15:17.517 --> 15:19.390
Nothing. Why?
What should it mean?

15:19.467 --> 15:21.409
Well, I'd have thought something.

15:21.540 --> 15:24.481
The items we recovered
from your cellar belonged to her.

15:24.558 --> 15:26.784
Oh, OK. Erm...

15:27.275 --> 15:29.955
Well, before she
gave them

15:30.032 --> 15:32.112
to whoever sold them at the fete,
you mean.

15:32.189 --> 15:33.500
Well, let's discuss that, shall we?

15:33.577 --> 15:36.870
Because we don't believe you did
buy them at a fete. Except, I did.

15:37.173 --> 15:38.416
It's just that that would be

15:38.493 --> 15:40.172
a fairly astonishing coincidence,
wouldn't it,

15:40.249 --> 15:43.281
that we're interviewing you
in connection with one murder

15:43.358 --> 15:46.341
and then we find items
in your possession

15:46.418 --> 15:48.517
that connect you to another?

15:49.750 --> 15:53.728
Alison Baldwin was raped
and murdered, also in woodland,

15:53.805 --> 15:57.088
about two and a half years
before Hayley died.

15:57.485 --> 16:02.025
And the one common thread, between
these two tragic deaths, is you.

16:03.094 --> 16:05.947
Except, you don't have a connection
between me and Hayley.

16:07.383 --> 16:11.861
Listen, I bought those objects
in Middenham at a fete.

16:12.258 --> 16:15.923
If Hayley's killer
lived in Middenham, then...

16:16.172 --> 16:18.761
..maybe he killed this other girl,
too,

16:18.838 --> 16:24.564
and then donated these objects
to the fete at some point.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.119
OK, well,
let's leave that there for now.

16:28.344 --> 16:30.650
One other thing
we wanted to run past you...

16:30.805 --> 16:36.041
Your Audi A4, the one that you drove
to Middenham in on 3rd January.

16:36.243 --> 16:40.455
Why do you think that we've found
a spare wheel for an A4,

16:40.532 --> 16:43.150
and corresponding boot casing,
in woodland,

16:43.227 --> 16:45.509
near the National Trust car park
behind The Spinney?

16:45.586 --> 16:46.961
No idea.

16:47.383 --> 16:49.693
They weren't from your car?
No.

16:49.770 --> 16:50.782
Oh.

16:50.859 --> 16:53.908
We think they were. We think you
dumped them there 18 years ago,

16:53.985 --> 16:57.131
in order to make the space in
the boot to conceal Hayley's body.

16:57.764 --> 17:00.548
I've told you why I went down there.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.320
Yeah, you have, Tim,
and we think that's a lie.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.869
And here's the thing...

17:03.946 --> 17:05.970
We've tracked down that car.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.656
Your A4.

17:07.969 --> 17:10.397
And it has a spare wheel
and it has the boot casing.

17:10.474 --> 17:12.759
But my guess is
they're both replacements.

17:12.867 --> 17:15.608
And if they are, what do you think
we're going to find underneath them,

17:15.685 --> 17:18.173
when we remove them later on
in our lab?

17:18.414 --> 17:21.298
Cos I don't think
you ever considered the possibility

17:21.375 --> 17:23.790
that that car would be found,
let alone searched.

17:24.069 --> 17:28.470
And I doubt very much
you cleaned it methodically.

17:28.594 --> 17:31.111
And if it's remained sealed
since then

17:31.274 --> 17:34.207
and Hayley's body was kept in there,

17:34.329 --> 17:36.612
there might still be
some forensic evidence.

17:36.689 --> 17:41.229
Hair, carpet fibres from her house,
maybe dried blood.

17:41.967 --> 17:43.717
Stuff we can check.

17:45.103 --> 17:47.055
- Anything to say to that?
- Nothing.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.042
Apart from the fact
that it's rubbish. So, check away.

17:50.602 --> 17:54.089
OK, let's go back to Alison Baldwin.
You say you've never heard of her.

17:54.970 --> 17:56.768
I haven't, I'm afraid.

17:56.845 --> 17:59.048
Where were you working in 1997?

18:01.429 --> 18:02.669
Er...

18:02.869 --> 18:04.672
Crowborough.
Right.

18:04.749 --> 18:06.580
A long way from Earlridge.

18:06.657 --> 18:09.304
What's Earlridge?
Well, I'll tell you.

18:17.451 --> 18:21.789
So, I'm showing the suspect
item 005.

18:22.959 --> 18:25.294
That's a black desk diary.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.015
It's dated 1997.

18:27.092 --> 18:28.779
Do you recognise this diary, Tim?

18:28.856 --> 18:32.421
Maybe. It looks like the sort
I've used in the past.

18:32.522 --> 18:34.529
Well, it looks like it
because it is, in fact, yours.

18:34.606 --> 18:37.023
We found it in a storage room
in your surgery.

18:39.803 --> 18:42.531
Read out to me the entry dated...

18:42.920 --> 18:46.960
..Wednesday, June 25th, 1977.

18:55.819 --> 18:57.148
"Conference.

18:57.225 --> 19:00.210
"Pain management protocols
for chronic conditions."

19:00.303 --> 19:01.851
So this was a conference,

19:01.928 --> 19:04.333
run by a pharmaceutical company,
that you attended.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.286
And there's an arrow in your diary,

19:06.363 --> 19:09.164
indicating that you were there
for two nights.

19:09.474 --> 19:11.095
If you say so.

19:11.405 --> 19:13.296
Can you remember where it was?
No.

19:13.498 --> 19:15.257
Well, it was in Cambridgeshire.

19:15.530 --> 19:19.757
It was in a hotel,
which you also stayed at...

19:19.905 --> 19:23.398
..about five miles
outside of Cambridge itself,

19:23.592 --> 19:26.640
in a small village called Earlridge.

19:26.866 --> 19:31.427
Now, you were there on the nights
of the 25th and the 26th.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.179
And it was on the night of the 26th

19:33.256 --> 19:36.192
that a young girl called Alison
Baldwin went missing in woods,

19:36.269 --> 19:40.250
200 yards from the hotel,
on her way to choir practice.

19:43.092 --> 19:47.179
So, I spoke to the CPS
earlier today...

19:47.608 --> 19:50.607
..to discuss the evidence available.

19:50.897 --> 19:55.234
And it's my belief now,
despite the answers you've given us,

19:55.365 --> 19:57.443
that we have reached
the threshold test

19:57.520 --> 19:59.703
to charge you with both murders.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.034
So don't you think it's time

20:02.111 --> 20:06.843
you gave Hayley and Alison's family
some... comfort

20:06.920 --> 20:10.398
and let them know
what happened to their children?

20:12.280 --> 20:14.445
Can't you just do that for them now?

20:22.803 --> 20:24.991
I'd like a cup of tea, please.

20:28.225 --> 20:30.445
And then maybe...

20:31.680 --> 20:33.830
..I'll go through it all with you.

20:35.511 --> 20:37.381
These girls.

20:38.557 --> 20:40.055
Go through what?

20:40.522 --> 20:42.734
What you just asked for,
what happened to them.

20:42.811 --> 20:44.281
How they died.

20:46.498 --> 20:48.807
Just to be clear, Tim,

20:49.334 --> 20:51.764
are you admitting you did kill them?

20:52.034 --> 20:53.707
Both of them?

20:57.279 --> 20:58.519
I am.

20:59.498 --> 21:03.856
And if we can do this properly...

21:04.295 --> 21:06.820
..if we can do this with respect...

21:08.389 --> 21:14.218
..if we can avoid turning it all
into some sort of sordid circus...

21:18.537 --> 21:21.507
..I'll tell you where the others
are buried, too.

21:48.443 --> 21:51.124
He was always such a vulnerable boy.

21:51.278 --> 21:54.015
Since way before that holiday.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.390
And who knows why things go awry
in the end?

21:58.482 --> 22:01.124
It could have been
because of what happened that night.

22:01.202 --> 22:05.575
Also, equally, it could have been
a thousand other slings and arrows.

22:05.652 --> 22:09.023
Self-inflicted or just... life.

22:09.865 --> 22:12.242
But you did what you did...

22:12.490 --> 22:14.812
..because you loved him.

22:15.865 --> 22:18.656
Love... him.

22:20.063 --> 22:21.732
As do I.

22:22.369 --> 22:23.889
Madly.

22:24.287 --> 22:26.327
And you wanted to protect him.

22:27.693 --> 22:31.663
God knows, being a parent makes
you do stupid things sometimes.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.820
I just want to say...

22:34.936 --> 22:39.390
..please don't destroy yourself
over this.

22:40.451 --> 22:42.168
He's 33.

22:42.529 --> 22:46.338
It's time he tried to start
to own his own life now.

22:46.506 --> 22:48.168
His own mistakes.

22:49.122 --> 22:50.886
And we have to let him.

22:51.006 --> 22:54.367
So I'm not going to call him
for a bit.

22:54.453 --> 22:56.683
Maybe you want to do the same.

22:57.060 --> 23:00.265
I mean, obviously, it's up to you.

23:04.311 --> 23:05.923
Is Amy coming back?

23:06.045 --> 23:07.538
I don't know.

23:08.826 --> 23:11.456
I'd have to change.
Yeah.

23:11.615 --> 23:14.406
Well,
you might want to consider that.

23:15.381 --> 23:17.202
I think she's a good 'un.

23:18.561 --> 23:20.507
Look after yourself.

23:21.532 --> 23:22.850
Mel...

23:24.601 --> 23:25.936
Thank you.

23:35.952 --> 23:38.390
I can't even
begin to imagine

23:38.467 --> 23:40.417
how you must feel right now.

23:41.459 --> 23:43.195
And the only...

23:43.529 --> 23:47.671
..consolation I can offer you
is that I promise you, I promise

23:47.937 --> 23:52.492
we will make sure
that he is never again allowed...

23:53.227 --> 23:55.137
..to hurt anyone...

23:55.951 --> 23:58.585
..the way he hurt Hayley and you.

24:05.373 --> 24:09.222
Having consulted with the Crown
Prosecution Service earlier today,

24:09.299 --> 24:13.216
and following a devoted
and superbly focused investigation,

24:13.293 --> 24:15.358
led by DCI Cassie Stuart,

24:15.435 --> 24:18.591
I can now confirm
that a 59-year-old man

24:18.668 --> 24:22.021
has been charged with the murder
of Hayley Louise Reid

24:22.098 --> 24:24.820
on December 31st, 1999.

24:24.904 --> 24:26.595
Timothy Colin Finch,

24:26.672 --> 24:29.921
of Baynham Road, Hamhurst, Sussex,

24:30.037 --> 24:34.140
has also been charged with the
murder of Alison Bethany Baldwin

24:34.264 --> 24:37.546
on 26th June, 1997,

24:37.664 --> 24:41.499
and he will appear at Marylebone
Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning.

24:42.107 --> 24:45.929
Tonight, he remains in custody
at Bishop Street Station,

24:46.006 --> 24:48.044
where he will continue
to be questioned

24:48.121 --> 24:50.640
in connection
with further possible offences.

24:50.717 --> 24:53.545
I would like to take
this opportunity to once again

24:53.622 --> 24:55.882
offer our most sincere
condolences

24:55.968 --> 24:57.896
to the families of the victims

24:57.973 --> 25:00.687
of these despicable crimes
and assure them

25:00.787 --> 25:02.903
that we will now work tirelessly

25:02.980 --> 25:05.624
to ensure that justice is done.

25:06.576 --> 25:09.068
No, that's not what I said.

25:09.279 --> 25:12.765
Obviously, I killed them
to protect myself.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.316
I'd raped them and,
unless I killed them,

25:15.393 --> 25:18.742
they were going to report me
and I was going to go to prison.

25:20.668 --> 25:24.468
No, what I'm baffled by...

25:24.780 --> 25:29.923
..is how I'm able to perform such
appalling acts in the first place.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.601
Do you feel any guilt
for what you've done?

25:32.952 --> 25:34.867
Do I feel any?

25:35.076 --> 25:36.279
No.

25:36.828 --> 25:40.820
On an intellectual level,
I understand the pain I've caused.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.881
But on an emotional level,
no, I feel nothing.

25:44.958 --> 25:47.851
Do you think you're capable
of feelings?

25:48.850 --> 25:52.114
For my children, yes,
there's definitely something there.

25:52.191 --> 25:55.960
And I feel anger on occasion.
But apart from that, probably not.

25:56.131 --> 25:59.396
So no feelings for your patients
or your friends.

25:59.522 --> 26:01.671
If I never saw
any of my friends again

26:01.748 --> 26:03.781
it wouldn't bother me
in the slightest.

26:06.193 --> 26:10.285
That's not exhausting,
all that pretence?

26:10.732 --> 26:12.146
No, I've done it my whole life.

26:12.223 --> 26:16.210
So, to me,
pretending is just second nature.

26:16.772 --> 26:20.066
All of which,
as I'm sure you'll know,

26:20.193 --> 26:24.437
suggests I'm pretty much a...
textbook psychopath.

26:24.514 --> 26:28.416
Above average intelligence,
superficially charming,

26:28.592 --> 26:31.234
zero empathy.
But how did that happen?

26:31.873 --> 26:35.742
Well, then, we're down to the
old nature-versus-nurture debate.

26:36.693 --> 26:39.978
I think the consensus now
is that it's a bit of both,

26:40.256 --> 26:44.687
genetic tendency, in conjunction
with some life experience,

26:44.764 --> 26:46.406
particularly in childhood.

26:46.525 --> 26:51.867
And, yes, my father was cold
and unloving, sometimes violent.

26:52.553 --> 26:57.640
Yes, my mother compensated
with a suffocating love.

26:58.338 --> 27:00.351
Except, if it was that,

27:00.826 --> 27:05.921
then how come my sister
isn't a serial killer?

27:06.818 --> 27:10.038
As I say,
it's baffling.

27:12.470 --> 27:17.213
And would you say sex was
the primary driver for your crimes?

27:17.290 --> 27:19.058
It was the only driver.

27:19.728 --> 27:23.125
Specifically, my unnatural obsession
with adolescent girls

27:23.202 --> 27:25.503
between the ages of 13 and 15.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.766
Children.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.486
Adolescents.

27:28.868 --> 27:32.045
Ephebophilia
is a very specific perversion.

27:32.236 --> 27:34.151
And when did this start?

27:35.578 --> 27:38.284
The obsession started young.

27:38.993 --> 27:40.963
Early 20s, I'd say.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.996
And what started it, do you think?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.429
Again, I have no idea, I'm afraid.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.448
These things
are often the result of...

27:49.999 --> 27:54.166
..some significant event
at the pertinent age.

27:54.376 --> 28:00.080
The idea being that said event then
arrests psycho-sexual development.

28:00.775 --> 28:02.310
And so I'd love to be able
to tell you

28:02.387 --> 28:04.690
that I witnessed my father,
I don't know, erm...

28:04.895 --> 28:07.445
..raping my sister
when she was 14 or something.

28:07.522 --> 28:09.078
But it didn't happen.

28:09.608 --> 28:11.768
So again, baffled.

28:12.349 --> 28:13.696
Sorry.

28:17.266 --> 28:19.096
And Hayley...

28:29.204 --> 28:32.916
Can you tell us what happened
the night she died?

28:34.353 --> 28:37.171
Well, wrong time, wrong place,
I guess,

28:37.248 --> 28:38.940
would be the way I'd put it.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.721
I was out looking for Chris.

28:43.273 --> 28:47.135
I'd been out
for about ten minutes or so.

28:47.788 --> 28:51.135
It was raining and...

28:51.249 --> 28:53.299
..I was in a bad mood.

28:54.648 --> 28:56.398
And then she just...

28:57.243 --> 29:00.034
..appeared out of the dark.

29:01.345 --> 29:03.948
I recognised her from the house.

29:05.337 --> 29:08.440
In fact, I'd masturbated about her
several times already.

29:08.843 --> 29:12.690
So, basically,
the opportunity seemed just...

29:13.024 --> 29:15.094
..too good to miss.

29:15.329 --> 29:18.557
And so, how did it happen,
the actual assault?

29:23.838 --> 29:26.291
Well, I said hello.

29:27.088 --> 29:29.112
And she said hello back.

29:30.718 --> 29:35.815
And then she passed by me
quite speedily, as I remember.

29:35.923 --> 29:38.338
I think she was probably
a little scared.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.951
And then, after she'd passed, I...

29:42.479 --> 29:44.869
..swung round and just...

29:45.243 --> 29:47.674
..grabbed her from behind,
round the neck.

29:48.103 --> 29:49.938
And she let out a little yelp,

29:50.015 --> 29:52.438
but I put my hand over her mouth

29:52.638 --> 29:55.828
and told her that, if she didn't
struggle, I wouldn't hurt her.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.168
OK.

30:02.564 --> 30:04.074
And then...

30:05.189 --> 30:07.086
..you what, you er...

30:07.173 --> 30:09.435
..you led her away from the path?

30:11.556 --> 30:12.626
Yes.

30:12.817 --> 30:15.677
50 yards or so into the woods.

30:16.338 --> 30:20.505
It was quite near the car park,
I later discovered, which was...

30:21.188 --> 30:23.818
..just good fortune.
I hadn't planned it.

30:31.521 --> 30:33.201
And then?

30:34.801 --> 30:39.075
And then I made her lay down
in the undergrowth...

30:39.878 --> 30:41.668
..and we had sex.

30:42.402 --> 30:43.989
You raped her.

30:45.191 --> 30:48.021
Yes. Apologies, I raped her.

30:49.788 --> 30:52.298
- Just once?
- Yes.

30:52.783 --> 30:53.974
And then?

30:54.051 --> 30:55.786
Then I strangled her.

30:58.113 --> 31:00.930
And for what it's worth...

31:01.677 --> 31:06.177
though death from strangulation
can take up to two to three minutes,

31:06.254 --> 31:09.128
unconsciousness
comes in as little as ten seconds,

31:09.205 --> 31:10.908
certainly no more than 20,

31:11.371 --> 31:13.231
so there was very little pain.

31:13.632 --> 31:15.383
Same with Alison.

31:15.511 --> 31:19.372
Please do reassure their families
about that.

31:22.269 --> 31:26.216
Was she your first, Alison Baldwin?

31:29.326 --> 31:30.686
So...

31:32.058 --> 31:35.020
..I intend to treat you
with respect.

31:35.097 --> 31:38.692
I hope you'll afford me
the same consideration.

31:39.128 --> 31:42.606
But, really, the most important
people here are the victims.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.529
So...

31:45.207 --> 31:48.593
..if I agree to take you somewhere,
as I said yesterday,

31:48.670 --> 31:53.083
no press, no cameras... no circus.

31:54.753 --> 31:57.239
- No circus.
- OK.

31:57.497 --> 31:59.367
There's somewhere...

32:00.738 --> 32:05.395
..less than an hour from here,
I think you'll be interested in.

32:10.499 --> 32:12.449
Tomorrow, then.

32:12.858 --> 32:14.414
First thing.

32:36.225 --> 32:37.788
Are you OK?

32:37.865 --> 32:39.168
Fine.

32:44.848 --> 32:47.179
I don't know
if he's playing a game...

32:47.980 --> 32:49.859
..if there are more.

32:50.148 --> 32:52.257
But, Jesus, whatever he's doing,

32:52.530 --> 32:56.101
I think that's the closest thing
to evil I've ever witnessed.

32:59.768 --> 33:02.349
We leave early tomorrow, before
seven, beat the traffic.

33:02.426 --> 33:03.506
Right.

33:04.928 --> 33:06.508
Night, boss.

33:27.457 --> 33:29.287
But what about Sal?

33:29.864 --> 33:32.464
I just have to deal with that.
But like I said...

33:33.305 --> 33:34.814
..it's whatever you guys want

33:34.891 --> 33:38.225
that... is the only thing
that matters to me.

33:39.694 --> 33:43.084
We love Mum, Dad. Of course we do.

33:43.248 --> 33:46.467
And we were, like,
so sad when you two split.

33:46.933 --> 33:48.253
But...

33:48.476 --> 33:50.928
..you've been happier
in the last nine months

33:51.007 --> 33:52.857
than we've seen you in years.

33:54.637 --> 33:56.537
You're with Sal now.

33:56.893 --> 33:59.342
And that's the Dad we like best.

34:01.714 --> 34:03.100
What's she said?

34:05.702 --> 34:06.902
Come here.

34:07.864 --> 34:09.856
You two...

34:32.605 --> 34:34.155
I meant to ask...

34:35.184 --> 34:39.447
Why did you bury her where you did,
Hayley, in the middle of a motorway?

34:39.524 --> 34:41.645
To see if I could get away with it.

34:42.647 --> 34:44.437
Childish, really.

34:45.559 --> 34:47.188
Tempting fate.

34:48.906 --> 34:50.580
But it just appealed.

34:52.235 --> 34:56.275
Do you know what, there were workmen
less than 100 yards away.

34:57.209 --> 34:59.408
Not one of them batted an eyelid.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.224
Here.

35:58.544 --> 36:00.064
Up there.

36:27.235 --> 36:28.985
Stop. Stop. Stop.

36:36.530 --> 36:38.455
Her name was Natasha.

36:39.842 --> 36:41.947
I took her six years ago.

36:42.607 --> 36:46.119
And, no, Alison wasn't my first.

36:59.914 --> 37:01.196
Boss?

37:09.425 --> 37:10.737
No more.

37:35.177 --> 37:36.600
There you are.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.943
Come.

37:42.005 --> 37:45.522
Jesus, Mila, I've been waiting
to hear from you for days.

37:45.599 --> 37:46.895
I've not known what to think.

37:46.972 --> 37:50.178
And then you greet me with a smile,
like, "Yeah, it's all fine."

37:50.286 --> 37:52.147
I had to know
who you were, Chris,

37:52.224 --> 37:54.661
and I only found that out for sure
yesterday.

37:54.738 --> 37:56.788
No, I told you about the murder,

37:56.865 --> 37:58.850
a-a-about the credit card stuff.
I told you.

37:58.927 --> 38:00.364
And do you think
I should have just believed you?

38:00.441 --> 38:03.077
Yeah, I think you should have had
a bit of faith, yeah.

38:05.738 --> 38:07.412
I used to have faith.

38:07.693 --> 38:10.452
Faith that life would be good for me
and my family.

38:10.794 --> 38:13.684
That my son would grow up
with a mother and father

38:13.761 --> 38:17.155
in our beautiful home,
in our beautiful country...

38:17.857 --> 38:22.827
..and become a doctor or a lawyer
or a professor.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.538
And then, one day,
a barrel bomb exploded and...

38:30.207 --> 38:33.263
..pieces of my husband's head
landed in our garden.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.310
So now I don't have in faith.

38:39.403 --> 38:41.249
I believe in facts.

38:41.326 --> 38:44.147
Which is why I went and spoke
to the officers

38:44.224 --> 38:46.756
who investigated you
about the credit card...

38:48.169 --> 38:51.100
..and asked them to tell me
if what you'd said was true.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.428
Which they did.

38:55.279 --> 38:58.131
And then I saw the news
about Hayley's killer.

38:58.779 --> 39:01.085
And so now, like you...

39:01.740 --> 39:04.178
..I think we could be very happy
together.

39:06.435 --> 39:08.553
But I understand I've hurt you.

39:08.685 --> 39:12.530
I can't apologise for what I did
because I feel I had no choice

39:13.724 --> 39:16.421
But I am sorry if you're in pain.

39:21.318 --> 39:24.342
And I hope we can repair that damage
together.

39:29.005 --> 39:33.171
Can I sleep with you tonight?
It's so cold in the van.

39:40.318 --> 39:43.131
You'll never have to sleep there
again.

39:56.169 --> 39:59.467
And I know you only stayed
because of me,

39:59.615 --> 40:02.178
because I felt a connection
to her here.

40:02.607 --> 40:06.381
But I don't any more, Jessie.
So you want to leave?

40:06.982 --> 40:09.655
You, me and Hayley.

40:23.721 --> 40:26.647
And we bury her somewhere beautiful,
Mum.

40:27.005 --> 40:29.366
So we can see her every day

40:29.466 --> 40:32.155
and remember her and smile

40:32.255 --> 40:35.186
and be grateful
for the time that she had...

40:35.740 --> 40:37.999
..and the time that we had with her.

40:38.076 --> 40:40.819
And Dad will visit
and we'll visit him.

40:41.216 --> 40:44.139
And we'll be happy, Jessie.

40:44.279 --> 40:46.186
I insist on it.

40:47.787 --> 40:49.617
We'll be happy.

41:11.696 --> 41:14.088
Oh, there you are.

41:14.165 --> 41:16.346
We've been so worried about you.

41:16.603 --> 41:18.313
I went for a walk.

41:22.969 --> 41:24.959
Let's get the jacket off.

41:26.024 --> 41:27.792
There we are.

41:28.352 --> 41:31.244
Go into the kitchen,
I'll get you a towel.

41:37.673 --> 41:40.674
Here we are.
Let's get this around you.

41:41.845 --> 41:45.096
Go and sit down,
I'll get you a cup of tea.

41:51.591 --> 41:53.490
I'm sorry, Dad.

41:53.597 --> 41:55.267
Sorry for what?

42:00.805 --> 42:02.686
You were right.

42:05.929 --> 42:07.719
I was lonely.

42:10.755 --> 42:11.926
And scared.

42:12.003 --> 42:13.800
And I didn't...

42:13.877 --> 42:16.107
..I didn't want you to leave.

42:18.814 --> 42:20.604
Maybe you...

42:21.792 --> 42:24.287
..you weren't so wrong, after all.

42:24.622 --> 42:26.997
Maybe I am getting a bit...

42:27.176 --> 42:28.920
..forgetful.

42:30.742 --> 42:33.214
But that's not what's important
right now.

42:33.291 --> 42:36.287
What's important
is getting you well.

42:37.382 --> 42:39.012
So I thought...

42:39.723 --> 42:42.053
..maybe you might need to...

42:43.305 --> 42:45.236
..to take some time off.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.783
Maybe you might need
a bit of rest, eh?

42:48.802 --> 42:50.537
I think I'd like that.

42:55.056 --> 42:57.131
I think I'd like that very much.

43:03.384 --> 43:04.864
I'm cold.

43:10.051 --> 43:11.384
It doesn't work, that.

43:11.461 --> 43:13.389
You know that, Tim.

43:14.619 --> 43:17.350
We can look into getting you
some new books...

43:18.191 --> 43:20.990
..if you give us
some useful information.

43:21.447 --> 43:23.967
The information has to come first.

43:26.512 --> 43:30.521
And what do you think the papers
will make of your unwillingness...

43:30.761 --> 43:32.683
..to help the grieving families?

43:32.760 --> 43:35.764
I'm not entirely sure
they'd see it like that.

43:37.899 --> 43:40.521
And how is DCI Stuart?

43:42.267 --> 43:45.357
Do we think
she'll ever return to work?

43:47.075 --> 43:49.732
Are we wasting our time here today?

43:52.262 --> 43:54.540
You must have been very pretty
when you were younger.

43:54.617 --> 43:56.420
OK, we're done

43:57.101 --> 43:59.100
We'll see you in a month, Tim.

43:59.351 --> 44:01.102
And do us a favour, next time,

44:01.179 --> 44:04.006
spare us
the Silence Of The Lambs shtick, OK?

44:06.165 --> 44:07.850
Tewkam Wold.

44:09.682 --> 44:12.045
It's a village south of Lincoln.

44:14.978 --> 44:17.328
Her name was Victoria.

44:47.435 --> 44:51.882
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

44:51.959 --> 44:53.381
Amen.

45:12.462 --> 45:14.008
And we got your invite.

45:14.085 --> 45:15.304
Yeah, can you come?

45:15.381 --> 45:18.076
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm just...

45:18.272 --> 45:20.173
I'm so happy for you, Chris.

45:20.287 --> 45:24.526
Well, you wait till you meet her,
because I've been incredibly lucky.

45:24.605 --> 45:26.447
I think we both have.

45:28.472 --> 45:30.428
Well, I've got to go. Uh.

45:30.505 --> 45:33.377
We're having our first scan
this afternoon.

45:33.605 --> 45:34.916
- No!
- Yeah.

45:34.993 --> 45:37.643
Yeah, I'm a glutton for punishment.

45:37.765 --> 45:40.319
Oh, Chris!

45:40.396 --> 45:41.950
Congratulations, mate!

45:42.027 --> 45:43.584
Mind you, you're completely nuts.

45:45.946 --> 45:49.236
I don't think anything
has ever felt so right.

45:49.313 --> 45:50.588
Brilliant news.

45:50.665 --> 45:53.166
Just... brilliant.

45:55.076 --> 45:56.431
You...

45:58.100 --> 45:59.963
You look after yourself.

46:02.016 --> 46:03.354
I love you, mate.

46:03.431 --> 46:05.212
I love you, too.

46:23.641 --> 46:25.309
Are you OK?

46:25.386 --> 46:26.669
Mm.

46:26.893 --> 46:28.293
I'm fine.

46:32.677 --> 46:34.213
Here we are.

46:45.220 --> 46:47.008
Won't be long.

46:52.750 --> 46:54.300
Hello, stranger.

46:54.531 --> 46:56.121
Hello, boss.

46:59.046 --> 47:00.419
I've missed you.

47:00.496 --> 47:02.273
I've missed you, too.

47:08.913 --> 47:10.477
Are you well?

47:10.873 --> 47:12.196
Surviving.

47:12.718 --> 47:14.132
How are the girls?

47:14.209 --> 47:17.078
- Oh, they're fine, thanks.
- And Sal?

47:17.352 --> 47:18.600
Yeah.

47:18.769 --> 47:21.656
Yeah, it's a journey.
Getting there, I think.

47:22.396 --> 47:23.585
And you?

47:23.715 --> 47:25.970
- Yeah, getting there, too.
- Yeah?

47:26.092 --> 47:29.226
Still just... very tired.

47:30.069 --> 47:32.139
30 years. It's a long time.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.070
It is.

47:36.297 --> 47:38.016
And maybe long enough.

47:40.731 --> 47:42.945
So, I see stuff all in the papers.

47:43.022 --> 47:44.884
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ongoing.

47:47.201 --> 47:48.991
And are you OK?

47:51.358 --> 47:53.219
I leave it at the office.

47:54.471 --> 47:55.899
He's a nothing.

47:55.976 --> 47:58.523
Not worthy of my energy
anywhere but work.

48:01.136 --> 48:02.586
They're beautiful.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.950
They were her favourites.

48:05.243 --> 48:07.658
They symbolise fresh starts,
apparently.

48:07.735 --> 48:09.344
Seems about right.

48:13.715 --> 48:15.508
Shall we go and see her, then?

48:15.904 --> 48:17.210
Let's.

48:19.547 --> 48:21.552
Hello.
