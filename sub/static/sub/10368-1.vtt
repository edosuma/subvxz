00:23.923 --> 00:28.307
WCAU AM Newstime in the city
of Brotherly Love is three PM.

00:28.403 --> 00:31.576
ln the news this hour,
President Nixon's re-election campaign

00:31.707 --> 00:34.746
was interrupted today
by Vietnam protestors,

00:34.877 --> 00:37.816
despite 25,000 American casualties,

00:37.947 --> 00:41.153
the President reiterated his plan
to stay the course.

00:41.282 --> 00:44.422
Thousands of women rallied
in Times Square this afternoon

00:44.553 --> 00:47.392
to demand equal pay for equal jobs.

00:47.523 --> 00:50.060
Feminist leaders took to
the podium to voice,

00:50.191 --> 00:55.368
we should be training to be a doctor,
not training to mary a doctor.

01:07.242 --> 01:09.914
l wish l could say that life
was always this simple.

01:10.780 --> 01:14.052
But, for me that really
came down to mo choices.

01:14.784 --> 01:18.591
Could l deal with rejection
and temporay pain, or,

01:19.255 --> 01:21.057
or should l sumer a life
filled with regret

01:21.189 --> 01:23.227
because l was afraid to take the risk?

01:30.900 --> 01:33.538
At the time l only knew
a few things about the college.

01:34.437 --> 01:38.344
lt was all girls,
their basketball team wasn't vey good.

01:43.913 --> 01:47.320
And, the school was
founded and run by the Nuns.

01:50.186 --> 01:51.855
l had no coaching experience,

01:51.987 --> 01:55.761
so l was somewhat surprised
when they responded to my resume.

01:56.292 --> 01:57.560
But, on the sumace,

01:58.394 --> 02:00.364
it seemed like
the pemect opportunih for a woman

02:00.496 --> 02:03.368
who wasn't ready to
assume her role in socieh.

02:22.418 --> 02:25.323
Hi, l'm May-Margaret O'Malley,
and welcome to Immaculata College.

02:25.454 --> 02:26.255
How may l help you?

02:26.388 --> 02:27.790
Ah, Mother St. John's office?

02:27.923 --> 02:30.295
Room mo menh, take the staircase
to the second floor...

02:30.426 --> 02:31.227
...lt's menh eight steps...

02:31.360 --> 02:32.729
Proceed through
mo walnut oak doors.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.632
And all even rooms on your left.

02:35.197 --> 02:35.864
Thank you.

02:35.999 --> 02:37.334
No, thank you.

02:37.633 --> 02:40.205
Oh, Rally for O'Malley.

02:56.886 --> 02:57.721
Catherine Rush?

02:57.853 --> 02:59.991
Yes. Thank you.

03:01.158 --> 03:03.762
Are you named after
St. Catherine of Sienna,

03:03.894 --> 03:06.131
or st. Catherine of Alexandria?

03:06.395 --> 03:09.067
ls there ah...
St. Catherine of Atlantic Cih?

03:10.199 --> 03:12.871
Well, if there is,
l hope she didn't sumer the same fate

03:13.003 --> 03:14.940
as St. Catherine of Alexandria.

03:15.071 --> 03:16.373
She was beheaded.

03:18.975 --> 03:20.043
Ah, here's my ah...

03:20.177 --> 03:23.116
lt's all right, l have one here.
l see you're married?

03:23.712 --> 03:25.549
Yes, just a few months now.

03:26.582 --> 03:30.089
Physical Educational degree
Westchester State College.

03:30.286 --> 03:31.187
Did you play there?

03:31.387 --> 03:32.255
Two years.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.825
What do you know about coaching?

03:34.958 --> 03:38.597
Well, l know for the first time,
it'll be five on five,

03:38.727 --> 03:43.303
full court with unlimited dribbling,
so it's obviously not our Mother's game.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.335
lt will be similar to the men's game.

03:45.802 --> 03:50.010
Yes, similar to the men's rules,
but the, the game will be dimerent.

03:50.306 --> 03:51.174
How so?

03:52.374 --> 03:54.779
Oh, we'll actually play like a team.

03:55.812 --> 03:59.285
And ah, ah, thim second shot clock
means better conditioned athletes.

04:00.349 --> 04:04.457
Are you suggesting that
our girls will become athletes?

04:04.587 --> 04:06.123
lf they want to win, yes.

04:06.255 --> 04:09.194
l'll be satisfied
if you just use these activities

04:09.325 --> 04:11.797
to suppress their hormones.

04:12.261 --> 04:14.565
Huh, l'll ty to add
that to the playbook.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.041
Well... seeing that no one else
has applied for the position,

04:21.771 --> 04:22.639
l'm prepared to offer you

04:22.772 --> 04:25.343
four hundred and fim dollars
for the season.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.714
That'll be just fine.
Do l get an assistant?

04:28.845 --> 04:31.951
No, only if they volunteer.

04:33.149 --> 04:37.691
Ah, this is our last ball.
Please ah, don't lose it.

04:38.454 --> 04:41.259
Thank you.
Can l ah, have a key to the gym?

04:41.390 --> 04:42.826
Oh, you won't need one.

04:43.459 --> 04:44.427
Great.

04:44.794 --> 04:46.998
The gym burned down
three months ago.

04:47.831 --> 04:49.901
Here's the student's schedule.

04:50.299 --> 04:51.300
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:51.433 --> 04:54.205
l must attend to
the needs of our Sisters.

04:54.638 --> 04:57.175
Practice is scheduled to
begin in three days.

04:57.306 --> 04:58.207
Ah, where?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.110
l don't know, you're the coach.

05:02.112 --> 05:03.447
Mrs. Rush...

05:04.514 --> 05:07.620
l hope you're a better coach
than you are a negotiator.

05:07.751 --> 05:08.719
Why is that?

05:08.852 --> 05:11.289
l was prepared to offer five hundred.

05:11.855 --> 05:15.429
That's okay,
cause l was willing to coach for free.

05:39.316 --> 05:40.852
Congratulations.

05:42.352 --> 05:43.520
Are you mad?

05:43.653 --> 05:44.921
Why would l be mad?

05:45.955 --> 05:48.660
You got that same look
when l beat you in tennis.

05:50.827 --> 05:52.062
When do you start?

05:54.831 --> 05:55.966
Tomorrow.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.070
Like l said Cathy,
why would l be mad?

05:59.202 --> 06:01.205
Come on Eddy, it's just a little
something to keep me busy.

06:01.339 --> 06:03.810
Just like ah...
tennis was a little something to ah...

06:03.940 --> 06:05.075
what, keep in shape?

06:05.208 --> 06:07.680
l know how bad you wanted to
go on this vacation, honey, and l do...

06:07.811 --> 06:09.915
lt's not about that, Cathy,
we both agreed to...

06:10.046 --> 06:11.916
Will you...
will you just hear me out?

06:13.817 --> 06:15.887
l, l want to have a family
with you...

06:16.320 --> 06:18.757
more than anything
in the whole world.

06:19.089 --> 06:21.227
But, if l don't ty this just once,

06:21.624 --> 06:23.995
l'll always wonder,
what if, you know?

06:24.561 --> 06:30.004
You know how much
l wanted this. Right?

06:33.036 --> 06:36.777
Let not yours be the output
the dawning with radiant...

06:36.906 --> 06:39.745
decoration of gold, and wearing...

06:40.009 --> 06:44.551
but let it be the hidden person
of the heart.

06:54.924 --> 06:56.193
Thank you.

07:01.365 --> 07:06.174
And since you are the joint heirs of
the grace of life,

07:06.337 --> 07:08.741
finally, all of you...

07:09.240 --> 07:11.444
have unih of spirits...

07:11.574 --> 07:14.846
Pass that to her.
That girl over there.

07:15.179 --> 07:17.917
...the sympathy,
Iove of the brethren,

07:18.048 --> 07:21.287
a tender heart and a humble mind,

07:21.419 --> 07:27.164
do not return evil for evil,
or reviling for reviling.

07:27.391 --> 07:31.699
For on the contray, bless, bless...

07:31.828 --> 07:34.266
Yeah, right there. Right

07:35.199 --> 07:41.210
...for this you have been called,
that you may obtain a blessing.

07:43.107 --> 07:46.112
This is the word of the Lord.

07:46.243 --> 07:48.246
Amen.

07:55.085 --> 07:55.685
Bonjour.

07:55.819 --> 07:58.992
Hey, l thought you were home
shopping for engagement rings?

07:59.123 --> 08:00.758
Nah, he wants to wait till graduation.

08:01.091 --> 08:04.664
He gave me his letter jacket,
as a pre-engagement ring.

08:04.794 --> 08:09.403
Ah, vey nice Lizanne.
We're going out for team, right?

08:10.901 --> 08:15.009
Why, so we can continue to
get crushed by all the bigger schools?

08:15.139 --> 08:19.948
Look, they didn't recruit me either.
You need to let it go.

08:20.077 --> 08:22.748
You know what,
l think l'm ready to get a job.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.852
Yeah. Right. Trishy.

08:26.016 --> 08:27.953
ln a week,
you'll be looking for an open gym.

08:28.085 --> 08:31.724
You in? We're in, right?

08:39.964 --> 08:41.332
Yeah, l'll think about it.

08:48.172 --> 08:50.175
We're also requesting, once again,

08:50.307 --> 08:54.515
that the heating system be
replaced in the Freshman dormitoy.

08:54.812 --> 08:56.682
So, where do l find these numbers?

08:57.014 --> 08:58.082
Page five.

08:58.516 --> 09:00.253
What about the alumni support?

09:00.384 --> 09:02.989
They're not banging
the buckets like they used to.

09:04.054 --> 09:05.022
Yes?

09:05.256 --> 09:07.293
Ah, Mother Superior, it's Cathy Rush.

09:07.424 --> 09:08.693
l'm in a meeting.

09:08.826 --> 09:10.595
l, l'll just wait out here.

09:11.228 --> 09:12.563
Oh, excuse me.

09:15.032 --> 09:15.967
What is it?

09:16.100 --> 09:17.903
lt's bitterly cold outside,
Reverend Mother

09:18.035 --> 09:19.738
and l can't find an indoor court.

09:19.870 --> 09:21.305
Excuse me.

09:21.639 --> 09:22.774
Sory.

09:29.513 --> 09:31.049
The old activih center.

09:31.181 --> 09:33.151
Oh, thank you so much,
and all of you, of course.

09:33.284 --> 09:34.920
Thank you for this opportunih, l...

09:35.052 --> 09:36.688
Please. Please.

09:40.658 --> 09:42.628
l wonder if you'd
all excuse me for a minute,

09:42.760 --> 09:46.066
l, l'd like a private word
with Monsignor.

10:38.215 --> 10:43.326
Ah, you can't depend on the trustees
for continued financial support.

10:43.754 --> 10:46.526
Now the board will be
meeting in three months...

10:46.890 --> 10:50.062
so, consider yourself warned.

10:51.061 --> 10:52.497
Mother of God.

10:52.730 --> 10:54.967
Don't take this personally.

10:55.165 --> 10:58.305
This is...
the business side of our church.

10:59.003 --> 11:02.410
But Tom, why can't we use
the insurance money from the gym?

11:02.540 --> 11:06.948
Unfortunately, it will take
an act of God to save this school.

11:07.911 --> 11:12.119
Well, that's exactly
what l've been praying for.

11:54.292 --> 11:55.127
Come in.

11:59.698 --> 12:00.533
Yes?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.237
Reverend Mother
may l speak with yo'u?

12:04.868 --> 12:05.836
Sit down.

12:12.644 --> 12:15.182
How may l be of assistance, Sister?

12:17.649 --> 12:20.021
l'm not sure l can do this anymore.

12:21.119 --> 12:26.195
Admissions is always dimicult,
especially in these changing times.

12:28.693 --> 12:30.296
That's not what l meant.

12:31.963 --> 12:36.738
l'm sory, but,
l'm requesting some time off.

12:39.337 --> 12:40.872
l'm not surprised.

12:41.539 --> 12:43.576
Did you ever struggle
with your calling?

12:47.479 --> 12:52.355
lf we didn't have to struggle,
we could never harvest the gloy.

12:57.055 --> 13:03.333
l'm sory Mother Superior,
l thought my service would be dimerent.

13:04.262 --> 13:07.034
l'll be glad to
reassign you to Chapel,

13:07.165 --> 13:10.839
that should give you plenh
of time to ask for guidance.

13:14.572 --> 13:16.709
Trish Sharkey.

13:16.908 --> 13:17.876
Here.

13:18.042 --> 13:19.277
Lizanne Caufield.

13:19.410 --> 13:21.647
lcei, it's French for here.

13:21.781 --> 13:26.957
Merci, it's French for be
a team player. Ah, what is it?

13:27.185 --> 13:29.355
l think l'm allergic to dust.

13:29.554 --> 13:33.896
You will make a wondemul husband.
Gail Moore.

13:34.292 --> 13:35.160
Here.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.262
Colleen McCann.

13:37.730 --> 13:38.765
Here.

13:39.464 --> 13:40.967
Was that a here, Miss McCann?

13:41.432 --> 13:42.433
Yes.

13:43.067 --> 13:49.312
Short, tall, fast or slow,
it's our voice that makes us one.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.475
Understood?

13:51.075 --> 13:52.277
Yes.

13:53.378 --> 13:54.480
Jen Galidino.

13:54.612 --> 13:55.513
Here.

13:56.715 --> 13:58.084
Who here likes to win?

14:00.385 --> 14:03.190
That is the only reason
you should be here.

14:04.189 --> 14:06.894
Unless, of course, you're tying to
avoid household chores.

14:07.525 --> 14:10.197
lf that's the case, we've already
got mo things in common.

14:11.196 --> 14:14.502
Jen, you know why teams win?

14:15.133 --> 14:16.201
Talent?

14:16.467 --> 14:19.472
lf basketball were only about talent,
it would be played one on one.

14:21.072 --> 14:22.575
You like these girls, Jen?

14:25.009 --> 14:26.277
Yeah, l guess.

14:27.713 --> 14:33.558
Okay. Who here thinks that
Jen's lipstick is a good color for her?

14:36.054 --> 14:38.458
Come on, anybody? Look at her.

14:38.858 --> 14:43.299
Cute girl, olive skin,
beautiful smile...

14:43.462 --> 14:45.799
and street corner lipstick.

14:47.466 --> 14:49.001
Colleen, care to comment?

14:52.303 --> 14:57.146
Trust. Trust is why teams win.

14:57.743 --> 15:01.851
And, if you can't trust your teammate,
to tell you your lipstick is wrong,

15:02.180 --> 15:05.019
you can't trust your teammate's call
at a back door screen.

15:06.217 --> 15:11.394
So, l will ask again...
who here thinks it's a bad color?

15:19.130 --> 15:23.806
Easy to fix. Watch each other's backs.
That's all l'm saying.

15:43.389 --> 15:44.958
Who here knows how to mim?

15:46.057 --> 15:48.127
Great, the wooden pool is open.

15:48.427 --> 15:50.631
lf you want it, fight for it.

15:55.967 --> 15:58.205
And, if you're afraid to
get your hair wet,

15:58.970 --> 16:01.074
you can always wear one of these.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.444
This is so unladylike.

16:06.077 --> 16:07.380
You should quit, too.

16:10.349 --> 16:11.517
Next.

16:12.718 --> 16:14.288
My dear Lord almighh.

16:15.354 --> 16:19.895
Running projections,
analyzing numbers,

16:20.125 --> 16:22.529
and finding applications.

16:24.095 --> 16:28.170
l failed to find
the spiritual nourishment required

16:28.300 --> 16:34.378
to enter my fifth year,
and take my final vows.

16:35.407 --> 16:38.011
So, l implore your divine guidance,

16:38.610 --> 16:41.582
to have mercy on me
in this dimicult time,

16:42.214 --> 16:44.318
and l ask that you send me ah...

16:49.688 --> 16:52.393
...l implore your divine...

16:56.428 --> 17:03.341
to send me a sign, any sign as
l will be listening for your voice.

17:58.490 --> 18:01.529
Bring it in, good job,
give yourselves a hand.

18:04.764 --> 18:08.938
l want each of you to
take one of these.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.907
Here you go, and pass them around.

18:14.974 --> 18:18.246
Hold the top mo corners bemeen
your index finger and your thumb.

18:21.480 --> 18:26.724
Uh huh. Now,
l want you to close your eyes.

18:28.187 --> 18:30.257
Close your eyes, good.

18:31.623 --> 18:34.595
Now, l want you to
envision evemhing

18:34.727 --> 18:38.166
you know about the game
of basketball.

18:39.565 --> 18:46.880
Defense, screens, jumpshots,
Iayouts, keep thinking.

18:48.273 --> 18:52.481
Evemhing you have ever done
on a basketball court...

18:52.712 --> 18:56.886
rebounds, bounce pass...
think some more.

19:00.587 --> 19:04.527
Now, l want you to
take all that knowledge

19:05.390 --> 19:12.705
and mentally transfer that knowledge
onto these delicate pieces of paper.

19:14.868 --> 19:17.840
Make sure you leave nothing behind.

19:19.204 --> 19:22.578
And take that paper,
hold it close to your heart...

19:25.712 --> 19:30.588
embrace that knowledge,
you can open your eyes.

19:32.417 --> 19:33.553
Excellent.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.590
Place them gently in the basket.

19:38.725 --> 19:39.860
There you go, Gail.

19:47.433 --> 19:55.949
Now, what we must do is
take evemhing you know and...

19:59.145 --> 20:03.420
get rid of it. l'll see you here
tomorrow at seven am.

20:03.716 --> 20:04.216
What?

20:04.350 --> 20:06.654
Get used to it,
and then again, four pm.

20:06.786 --> 20:07.487
That's mice?

20:07.620 --> 20:09.557
Bright and early. Good night, girls.

20:09.756 --> 20:10.757
Two times?

20:11.491 --> 20:12.693
Where did you play?

20:13.126 --> 20:14.596
West Catholic.

20:15.195 --> 20:16.531
lt's a nice pass.

20:32.512 --> 20:34.549
Ma, where are Frankie's boots?

20:34.681 --> 20:36.785
By the front door. They're wet.

20:39.719 --> 20:41.689
Just need some plastic bags.

20:50.231 --> 20:51.600
Oh, thanks Ma.

20:59.472 --> 21:01.209
And, tell Frankie
l'll need a ride home.

21:01.374 --> 21:02.209
Will do.

21:03.109 --> 21:04.445
Got to go.

21:06.312 --> 21:07.347
Love yah.

21:08.314 --> 21:09.349
Love you, too.

21:46.886 --> 21:48.556
Before evey practice,

21:48.688 --> 21:50.691
l'd wait outside
that gym and hope

21:50.823 --> 21:54.397
that five girls would be
willing to race a new world.

21:57.530 --> 22:01.237
We started with fifteen girls who
had fifteen dimerent stories,

22:01.434 --> 22:03.738
and it didn't take long to hear them.

22:03.937 --> 22:06.274
Jen was our fun-loving Nurse
in training.

22:07.274 --> 22:10.179
She was looking for an excuse
to get out of the house.

22:12.512 --> 22:15.986
Lizanne, a solid role player
who could be a star

22:16.116 --> 22:18.520
if she wasn't
so busy planning her engagement.

22:19.652 --> 22:23.192
And, Trish, a big time player
who got overlooked,

22:23.324 --> 22:24.259
so all she could think about was

22:24.390 --> 22:27.162
where she wasn't
and what she didn't have.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.165
And so, we began.

22:45.312 --> 22:46.915
Plaid sashes, huh?

22:47.513 --> 22:50.652
So, l heard you were the all time
Ieading scorer at Oakcrest High.

22:52.252 --> 22:57.562
God, yeah l was.
Too bad l never liked pom-poms.

22:59.059 --> 23:00.194
l don't get it.

23:01.394 --> 23:04.099
Senior year they dropped
Girls Varsih Basketball.

23:05.933 --> 23:07.870
They asked us to be
Cheerleaders instead.

23:08.335 --> 23:09.303
That's not right.

23:09.669 --> 23:11.305
That's what l thought, too.

23:13.707 --> 23:14.809
Thanks for the new rim.

23:18.045 --> 23:19.715
We are here to serve.

23:20.981 --> 23:22.718
l can't wear this.

23:22.916 --> 23:25.220
Swing your partners
round and round.

23:25.352 --> 23:26.554
lt's not that bad.

23:26.687 --> 23:28.456
That's because you're already married.

23:28.655 --> 23:30.457
Who are these inspected by,
Adam and Eve?

23:30.590 --> 23:33.863
For now.
This is all we have, so buck up.

23:36.596 --> 23:39.869
All right. Stretch it out, come on.

23:50.611 --> 23:51.813
You're still here.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.448
Bend your knees.

23:56.784 --> 24:00.023
The first thing you'll learn,
how to defend.

24:00.486 --> 24:02.189
lf you can defend,
it shows me you care,

24:02.790 --> 24:05.294
and if you care, we can play as one.

24:06.226 --> 24:07.394
Now, get low.

24:07.594 --> 24:09.664
Hands out, palms up.

24:10.864 --> 24:12.199
Slide left.

24:15.569 --> 24:16.871
Lower.

24:17.137 --> 24:19.609
Don't cheat me, don't cheat yourself.

24:19.740 --> 24:21.142
Come on back this way.

24:21.708 --> 24:23.010
Okay good. Keep going.

24:25.479 --> 24:26.647
There you go.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.382
Good job, Trish.

24:29.451 --> 24:32.623
First thing evey young girl
should learn,

24:32.753 --> 24:34.590
proper way to clean a floor.

24:35.622 --> 24:38.594
So, ladies.

24:38.859 --> 24:39.527
Make it shine.

24:40.060 --> 24:43.099
Slide, slide. Left.

24:43.230 --> 24:46.470
For the next six months,
you need to break up with your ego,

24:46.733 --> 24:47.768
if you can't do that,

24:47.968 --> 24:49.638
there are plenh of
playground courts out there

24:49.770 --> 24:51.239
that'll accommodate you.

24:51.805 --> 24:54.877
Anyone else want to quit,
now would be a good time.

24:55.142 --> 24:59.818
Right, slide, slide.
Good Trish. Slide.

24:59.980 --> 25:01.783
Representing this school
is a privilege.

25:01.915 --> 25:04.854
Mimi, down.
We will learn to defend it.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.891
She already has a husband,
why would she want to work?

25:08.021 --> 25:09.424
We know who she's married to,
right?

25:09.623 --> 25:11.225
Ed Rush, the NBA rep.

25:11.426 --> 25:14.365
Word is, he had to give
Mother Superior a case of hand lotion,

25:14.496 --> 25:15.865
just to close the deal.

25:16.063 --> 25:18.468
Wouldn't surprise me,
around here that stum is like gold.

25:18.565 --> 25:19.667
Frankincense and Mer.

25:20.567 --> 25:23.138
That's because it's the only gift
they're still allowed to keep.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.071
ls that true?

25:25.005 --> 25:27.577
Am l crazy or does the cook's shoes
clash with her belt today.

25:27.708 --> 25:30.145
The woman has got a lot of shoes.

25:30.278 --> 25:33.617
l liked it better when her uniform
smelled like mothballs and cigarettes.

25:33.747 --> 25:34.582
Yeah.

25:36.417 --> 25:42.362
Catch. Pivot. And Pass.

25:43.424 --> 25:45.828
Catch, pivot and pass.

25:45.959 --> 25:47.195
Be careful, it's hot.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.231
Let's go. Press break.

25:49.364 --> 25:50.933
No, no, the other end.

25:51.098 --> 25:52.234
Come on, come on.

25:52.367 --> 25:53.435
Hustle up.

25:58.839 --> 26:01.945
Move it. Move it. Move it.

26:02.075 --> 26:03.578
Good. Yes.

26:03.710 --> 26:06.515
Ball movement and teamwork
that's how we break the press.

26:06.713 --> 26:09.385
All right, let's run it again, come on.

26:09.616 --> 26:10.684
Good, good, good.

26:10.817 --> 26:12.353
That's what l'm talking about.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.330
Did you see that?

26:24.665 --> 26:26.000
Yeah.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.740
Well, that's exactly
why they're in first place.

26:35.510 --> 26:39.084
Cathy, you...
mind if l get some work done here?

26:39.213 --> 26:41.116
No, no, of course not.

26:41.983 --> 26:45.255
See, they never let anyone
get an easy basket.

26:45.553 --> 26:46.821
Cathy.

26:47.888 --> 26:49.891
Great. Ah.

26:59.733 --> 27:02.805
So, who here still
needs a ride to the game?

27:04.771 --> 27:06.841
Does ah, anyone have a car?

27:08.910 --> 27:10.812
Any parents going?

27:12.614 --> 27:15.686
Really? Friends, family...

27:15.950 --> 27:16.851
Nope.

27:17.018 --> 27:19.522
Anybody know anyone
who can drive?

27:19.653 --> 27:21.089
l can drive four.

27:22.824 --> 27:26.998
Ah, great, well ah,
l can handle the rest.

27:27.462 --> 27:28.430
Can l help you?

27:28.563 --> 27:30.466
Yeah, l'm here for Trish.

27:31.165 --> 27:32.433
He's my brother.

27:34.135 --> 27:37.007
Okay, you can stay.
Thanks, Ralph.

27:38.873 --> 27:42.079
All right, get some rest,
big day tomorrow.

27:43.845 --> 27:47.752
Ah listen, you need to hury
the band practice is in an hour.

27:48.316 --> 27:49.551
Girl's locker room?

27:49.683 --> 27:52.455
Right through there,
door marked, ''Ladies Room''.

27:53.988 --> 27:56.459
Oh and ah,
the walls are out of bounds.

27:57.392 --> 27:58.895
Thank you.

28:08.770 --> 28:09.972
Come on in.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.412
All right Rosemay, come on.

28:22.483 --> 28:23.619
You okay, coach?

28:24.719 --> 28:27.791
Sure. We'll get through this.

28:30.858 --> 28:34.699
l want each of you to
pin this on to your uniform.

28:35.096 --> 28:36.264
Right.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.947
As you think, so shall you be.

28:50.945 --> 28:52.414
All right. Listen up.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.255
Sory.

29:04.392 --> 29:06.730
All right. Let's go.

29:15.203 --> 29:18.944
Come on...
kick the ball out, kick the ball out.

29:29.685 --> 29:30.920
Trish.

29:32.454 --> 29:34.023
Did you forget
your bathing cap, Mimi?

29:34.155 --> 29:36.360
Did you forget there
were five of us?

29:49.671 --> 29:51.173
Good afternoon, Sister.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.009
Good afternoon, Coach.

30:03.084 --> 30:04.353
Heavenly Father.

30:06.988 --> 30:09.560
l seek your help in this time of need.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.128
There are times...

30:12.594 --> 30:15.967
when we need the strength to
survive things on our own.

30:19.401 --> 30:22.306
And then, there are times

30:22.638 --> 30:25.944
when we need your help
and the help of others.

30:26.107 --> 30:29.747
And, l ask for your help
in finding me an assistant coach.

30:31.547 --> 30:34.252
Of course, she'll have to help me
find a gym to play our home game.

30:34.383 --> 30:35.518
Hah.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.988
And it'll be really great
if she had a car.

30:38.821 --> 30:40.925
Okay, now you're pushing it.

30:41.590 --> 30:42.858
Well.

30:43.090 --> 30:45.128
Oh, come on, you just need a driver.

30:45.294 --> 30:46.963
Look, we can do this.

30:47.329 --> 30:48.898
Now it's a we?

30:49.131 --> 30:50.933
l know l can't do it alone.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.435
Amen.

30:53.502 --> 30:56.608
Was than Amen, or l'm in?

31:01.376 --> 31:02.644
Both.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.560
Move the ball.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.671
Get back, get back.

31:47.522 --> 31:49.325
Little safer at the end of the bench.

31:50.259 --> 31:51.794
What can l do for you Trish?

31:51.994 --> 31:53.496
l got a job in a department store

31:53.629 --> 31:55.632
and they need me
there three days a week.

31:57.399 --> 31:59.871
Well, we're going to miss you.

32:02.872 --> 32:04.274
Can l do both?

32:04.439 --> 32:06.309
Oh, not in our program.

32:10.545 --> 32:12.615
ls that job something
you've always dreamed of?

32:12.748 --> 32:13.749
No, not really.

32:15.584 --> 32:18.256
But employees do
get fim percent discount.

32:18.888 --> 32:20.557
l can only tell you this,

32:21.490 --> 32:24.028
have the courage to
follow your dreams.

32:24.259 --> 32:25.996
That's your gift to the world.

32:26.128 --> 32:28.599
Maybe it's working in
a department store, l don't know.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.905
But, if you give that gift,
l promise,

32:33.035 --> 32:35.639
a day will come when
the world returns the favor.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.079
l thought dreams were
only for rich kids?

32:42.411 --> 32:46.051
No, dreams are for eveybody,
all you need is the heart.

32:47.182 --> 32:50.254
You have the gift to play this game,
Trish Sharkey.

32:50.954 --> 32:55.462
There is no doubt in my mind,
but you have to believe it.

33:00.495 --> 33:02.666
You let me know what you decide,
all right?

33:11.506 --> 33:12.942
So, what a million dollars?

33:13.408 --> 33:16.080
Wouldn't it be better just to
borrow against the equih?

33:16.211 --> 33:19.250
That would barely be enough
to pay for the upkeep.

33:19.749 --> 33:21.485
But, where would my Sisters go?

33:21.985 --> 33:26.694
We will have more than enough to
insure they enjoy a comfortable life.

33:26.823 --> 33:28.492
But, what about the students?

33:29.324 --> 33:32.597
There are plenh of colleges
in this area.

33:32.929 --> 33:35.199
l might have a tough time
explaining this to my wife

33:35.330 --> 33:37.434
and her former classmates.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.704
But, if you could secure
a written offer

33:40.035 --> 33:43.040
with those hpes of numbers,
we'd be foolish not to sell.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.976
l move that we improve
the research of these activities

33:46.108 --> 33:49.080
and ask that we reconvene
in nineh days.

33:52.314 --> 33:54.852
l, l think we'd be playing better
ifwe just had a few more things,

33:54.984 --> 33:56.787
so l put a list together.

33:57.052 --> 33:58.522
Here we go.

33:58.988 --> 34:00.925
Ah, you may not be able to
read my handwriting...

34:01.056 --> 34:04.797
ah, new uniforms, ah warm ups and,
and, and team sneakers.

34:04.927 --> 34:08.233
Oh yes, well,
l'd be happy to be of assistance.

34:08.362 --> 34:09.498
Yeah?

34:09.732 --> 34:12.871
Sure, just follow me.
Let's see what we have.

34:56.244 --> 35:00.653
This is my room, you can help
yourself to anything l have.

35:19.134 --> 35:21.639
And then Mimi crashes
the boards hard.

35:29.545 --> 35:30.546
Where you going?

35:31.380 --> 35:34.719
Frankie, you have friends?

35:35.017 --> 35:35.952
Aqm.

35:36.085 --> 35:37.488
Friends who play basketball?

35:37.687 --> 35:38.989
ls there another kind?

35:43.192 --> 35:45.195
Ohh, l hope this works.

36:10.000 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:26.302 --> 36:29.775
Rosemay...
if Frankie is cutting through the lane,

36:29.906 --> 36:31.776
you need to keep contact with him.

36:31.908 --> 36:34.446
lf he's going to be aggressive,
how should you play?

36:34.744 --> 36:35.947
Same way.

36:36.079 --> 36:38.049
Right on, but with a pony tail.

36:39.849 --> 36:41.686
Let's go, ball in.

36:42.953 --> 36:45.057
Sounds good. Good stum.

36:48.424 --> 36:50.795
lt's okay to pass the ball, Frankie.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.462
Thank you.

36:59.435 --> 37:00.737
Flash to the ball

37:05.341 --> 37:07.378
Good, good, good. Yes.

37:13.050 --> 37:14.118
Blow the whistle.

37:17.453 --> 37:20.559
Hey, Colleen, you need to
get bemeen him and the basket.

37:20.690 --> 37:22.527
How many times did Coach
go over this.

37:22.725 --> 37:25.832
See your man, and the ball...
okay.

37:25.963 --> 37:28.300
Know where he is at all times.

37:28.431 --> 37:31.103
Find him and box up.

37:31.300 --> 37:36.143
Stay with him, just like this,
don't let him get the rebound. Okay?

37:37.975 --> 37:39.778
Good job.

37:39.977 --> 37:43.818
Mrs. Rush,
may l have a word with you, please?

37:48.417 --> 37:51.356
There are no men
allowed on this campus,

37:51.487 --> 37:55.494
let alone having physical
contact with our girls.

37:55.625 --> 38:00.201
Now, send these boys home.
l've got my eye on you mo.

38:04.167 --> 38:07.573
All right boys, ah,
that'll do for today.

38:18.582 --> 38:21.086
Reverend Mother
wasn't always this stressed.

38:21.517 --> 38:26.093
When she first got here,
we'd stay up all night playing Poker.

38:26.422 --> 38:29.494
Of course, that's when they used to
give us walking around money.

38:29.893 --> 38:32.898
She'd look at her cards,
Iay them down,

38:33.063 --> 38:36.537
straighten out here cash and say...
be not afraid.

38:37.067 --> 38:38.670
Then she'd bet evemhing.

38:39.468 --> 38:40.804
Boy, was she good.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.807
Oh, she took a few bucks from me.

38:43.573 --> 38:46.845
And that activih room
used to be packed,

38:47.010 --> 38:50.383
l'd have to wait thim minutes
to get on the bike.

38:50.647 --> 38:51.949
Those were the days.

38:53.382 --> 38:55.453
People had
a little respect for the habit.

38:55.585 --> 38:57.455
Now look at us, in a few years,

38:57.587 --> 38:59.857
we're going to be
an exhibit at the Smithsonian.

39:01.091 --> 39:02.727
We need to stick together.

39:03.293 --> 39:07.769
First mitch, oh,
somebody better help me out here.

39:12.302 --> 39:14.039
Oh, bless you.

39:14.805 --> 39:16.240
Maybe you could
use some of your rec time

39:16.340 --> 39:18.578
and come out and cheer
on the basketball team.

39:21.445 --> 39:23.114
Watch the pick and roll.

39:29.119 --> 39:29.887
Hold.

39:33.857 --> 39:34.825
Time out.

39:35.225 --> 39:36.193
You got to get there sooner.

39:36.327 --> 39:36.894
l tried.

39:37.027 --> 39:38.497
-Move your feet...
-you can't just stand there

39:38.628 --> 39:39.863
after you get beat.

39:40.931 --> 39:42.668
lf you call for help
and she helps you,

39:42.799 --> 39:43.967
then you need to help her.

39:44.101 --> 39:47.106
Help the helper,
that is the way it works.

39:47.237 --> 39:48.807
Does eveybody understand that?

39:54.144 --> 39:56.114
Just play the team, all right.

39:56.947 --> 39:57.948
Bring it in.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.621
One, mo, three, team.

40:04.521 --> 40:05.689
Team!

40:15.766 --> 40:17.068
Help, help, help.

40:17.201 --> 40:18.369
Help your man.

40:23.907 --> 40:26.545
Protect the basket,
come on, move your feet.

40:42.592 --> 40:44.062
You call that, defense?

40:44.661 --> 40:46.765
l need to find out
who wants to be here.

40:47.764 --> 40:49.868
Shake hands and get in the van.

40:51.235 --> 40:53.872
Come on, girls. Let's Go.
It's okay.

41:03.214 --> 41:04.249
What is she doing?

41:04.382 --> 41:05.450
l don't know.

41:07.151 --> 41:08.820
Watch your step, ladies.

41:13.623 --> 41:20.236
Come on, pick it up. Bring it in.

41:20.364 --> 41:21.866
Colleen.

41:25.203 --> 41:26.538
Come on, come on.

41:29.140 --> 41:30.943
All right, take your jackets off.

41:31.508 --> 41:33.111
Jackets off.

41:36.147 --> 41:38.618
Let's go, defensive slide drills.

41:38.715 --> 41:39.583
Here?

41:39.716 --> 41:41.286
Defensive slide drills.

41:41.419 --> 41:42.821
Who's first?

41:45.156 --> 41:47.493
Mimi. You're up.

41:47.859 --> 41:49.461
Palms up, back side down.

41:50.461 --> 41:54.468
Up and back. Go, go, go.

41:56.033 --> 41:59.472
Trish, Colleen, Gail,
Rosemay, come on, come on.

41:59.603 --> 42:02.575
lf you want to stay dy,
you need to lift your feet.

42:02.807 --> 42:06.180
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

42:10.248 --> 42:11.550
l don't like this.

42:17.054 --> 42:17.654
Cathy, that's enough.

42:17.788 --> 42:19.323
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

42:19.457 --> 42:21.294
Again, here we go,
one more time.

42:21.425 --> 42:22.260
Get through.

42:23.660 --> 42:25.130
Trish, get in there.
Lizanne, come on.

42:25.263 --> 42:27.266
Gail, Rosemay, come on, come on.

42:28.266 --> 42:32.040
Our results will not change
until our habits change.

42:34.939 --> 42:36.274
Too dangerous.

42:36.440 --> 42:37.375
Come on, come on.

42:39.677 --> 42:42.014
Come on.
Here we go, here we go.

42:42.914 --> 42:45.786
Get back in now, go, go, go.

42:46.583 --> 42:49.355
Lower, lower, lower, lower, faster.

42:49.487 --> 42:51.057
Keep your feet dy.

42:52.356 --> 42:54.159
Are we in it together?

42:56.494 --> 42:57.964
Cathy, stop.

43:03.067 --> 43:05.639
Here we go, you're not done.
Going back.

43:09.173 --> 43:12.747
How much are you willing to sacrifice,
huh, how much?

43:12.877 --> 43:15.782
Come on, move, move, move.
There you go, there you go.

43:15.913 --> 43:17.315
There you go. Keep it going.

43:17.448 --> 43:18.617
Cathy, that's enough.

43:19.016 --> 43:21.320
Here we go,
one more time, back in.

43:22.687 --> 43:25.024
Keep your feet dy.

43:27.124 --> 43:29.127
Here we go, come on,
come on, come on.

43:29.727 --> 43:32.999
Cathy, stop. These girls were
sent here for an education.

43:33.130 --> 43:35.200
ln what, historic preservation?

43:36.867 --> 43:38.971
l'll see you in the morning.

43:46.944 --> 43:48.146
Hey.

43:55.886 --> 43:56.954
What?

43:57.788 --> 44:00.627
Maybe this isn't working out
the way we planned, huh?

44:00.758 --> 44:01.993
Well, you're going to have to adjust.

44:02.126 --> 44:04.330
Huh, l'm going to have to adjust?

44:04.463 --> 44:07.000
To what?
To never seeing each other, to ah...

44:07.131 --> 44:09.335
never having dinner together,
to ah, ah,

44:09.468 --> 44:10.536
watching game films together.

44:10.668 --> 44:12.237
You know,
maybe l don't want to adjust, huh.

44:12.371 --> 44:13.205
lt's not my fault you're ah,

44:13.338 --> 44:17.011
spinning your wheels on something
that no one cares about, Cathy.

44:18.943 --> 44:20.446
l, l care.

44:20.811 --> 44:22.447
What, you'd rather
l just sit at home all day

44:22.581 --> 44:24.518
while you travel
allover the county?

44:24.650 --> 44:27.021
Yes, you know,
l travel so l can pay for this apartment

44:27.151 --> 44:28.119
and evemhing else that's here.

44:28.252 --> 44:30.122
What they pay you,
that's not even legal.

44:30.254 --> 44:32.359
All right, most women,
they would be grateful.

44:32.624 --> 44:33.692
Grateful?

44:34.225 --> 44:35.628
Hey, in the past three years,

44:35.760 --> 44:37.396
do you know
what l've done with my free time.

44:37.795 --> 44:41.302
l go to your games.
l find the time to support you.

44:42.767 --> 44:44.804
So, l'm thinking you don't
understand what grateful is.

44:44.935 --> 44:46.571
Ah, l didn't know
you were so unhappy.

44:46.704 --> 44:48.574
l am not unhappy.

44:48.939 --> 44:50.776
Well, you don't sound
too happy right now.

44:51.209 --> 44:52.711
l'm frustrated, it's dimerent.

44:52.843 --> 44:55.348
Because you're tying
too hard to change these girls,

44:55.480 --> 44:56.849
Cathy, and they don't want it.

44:56.981 --> 44:59.018
lt's not that they don't want it,

44:59.150 --> 45:01.321
it's that they have been told
so long that they can't have it,

45:01.453 --> 45:04.492
that, that they can't
even imagine wanting it.

45:05.157 --> 45:07.093
You know, l can't even talk to you.

45:14.232 --> 45:15.801
Seven am, and ah...

45:16.301 --> 45:19.206
They're not here. It's okay.

45:20.238 --> 45:22.108
Maybe l pushed them too far.

45:27.044 --> 45:30.584
Maybe Ed is right,
and they're not like me,

45:31.383 --> 45:32.985
and they don't want what l want.

45:41.359 --> 45:47.170
Mrs. Rush, your entire team
broke cumew last night.

45:47.332 --> 45:49.035
We've never had that before,

45:49.534 --> 45:52.806
nor have we had anyone
endanger the lives of the girls.

45:52.937 --> 45:53.338
l...

45:53.472 --> 45:58.248
Now, that is unacceptable.
You leave me no choice.

45:58.376 --> 45:59.945
lt was my idea.

46:01.779 --> 46:02.780
l should have known.

46:04.616 --> 46:08.590
So, you finish out the season,
and then that's it.

46:09.154 --> 46:12.493
Don't be surprised
if all the others quit, too.

46:16.728 --> 46:18.231
You didn't have to do that.

46:18.363 --> 46:21.535
l know. But, we can't give up.

46:23.435 --> 46:27.242
l don't know if you've noticed, but...
we have no team.

47:03.441 --> 47:05.711
Rosemay, you're going to
force the ball in the sidelines.

47:05.844 --> 47:07.713
Now, l need you
to keep your feet dy.

47:07.846 --> 47:08.713
You got that?

47:08.847 --> 47:11.685
Trish, Trish, you're going to
sneak in and double team.

47:11.818 --> 47:13.988
Don't reach,
no don't reach because, Gail,

47:14.119 --> 47:16.924
l want to anticipate this pass
across court, you got that?

47:17.055 --> 47:17.522
Here we go.

47:17.656 --> 47:20.896
Yeah.... one, mo, three, team!

47:21.026 --> 47:24.265
One, mo, three, team!
Go, yeah. Get in there.

47:25.263 --> 47:29.004
Go girls. Right, right, right.

47:30.869 --> 47:32.839
Go, go. Nice.

47:35.307 --> 47:37.277
Yes, yes, yes.

47:37.409 --> 47:39.279
Yes, yes, yes.

47:39.878 --> 47:41.681
That's what l'm talking about.

48:00.498 --> 48:01.601
What?

48:02.334 --> 48:03.603
Nothing.

48:04.269 --> 48:05.437
May l help you ladies?

48:05.872 --> 48:07.374
Coldest thing on tap.

48:07.505 --> 48:07.873
Okay.

48:08.006 --> 48:10.644
-l'll ah, have the same.
-Okay.

48:10.877 --> 48:12.680
Oh and ah,
melve number mos to go.

48:12.812 --> 48:14.114
You got it.

48:16.314 --> 48:18.251
And put those drinks on my tab.

48:18.383 --> 48:20.888
Oh no, you, you don't have to do that.
It's fine.

48:21.019 --> 48:22.221
Thank you.

48:27.158 --> 48:28.360
Just passing through?

48:28.494 --> 48:29.729
Aren't we all.

48:30.529 --> 48:32.666
l like a woman with
a sense of humor

48:32.798 --> 48:36.104
but l bet a prem gal such as
yourself must be hitched?

48:36.334 --> 48:37.804
You could say that.

48:38.336 --> 48:39.806
What's the old man do?

48:42.974 --> 48:46.715
He's ah... carpenter.

48:46.812 --> 48:48.415
He's good with his hands, is he?

48:49.147 --> 48:50.917
Works miracles.

48:52.785 --> 48:53.553
And you?

48:53.686 --> 48:57.593
Ah... my husband's also vey good
with his hands, thanks for asking.

48:57.989 --> 48:59.492
The good ones are always taken.

49:00.927 --> 49:02.930
Ah, do you ladies like to dance?

49:04.697 --> 49:06.434
Thank you, but we'll have to pass.

49:06.565 --> 49:08.335
Ah, girls night out.

49:08.701 --> 49:12.274
l can respect that.
You ladies have a nice evening.

49:12.371 --> 49:13.539
You, too.

49:16.107 --> 49:18.010
You are trouble.

49:20.313 --> 49:21.848
Takes one to know one.

49:21.980 --> 49:23.082
Nice win.

49:24.182 --> 49:25.385
Who's in?

49:25.518 --> 49:26.118
l am.

49:26.252 --> 49:27.754
Ah, Math.

49:27.853 --> 49:30.325
Who do you pray to when you need
help balancing your checkbook?

49:30.456 --> 49:32.259
Ah, l just pray to my Dad.

49:32.725 --> 49:35.162
My Dad would kill me
if he knew l was going to college.

49:35.294 --> 49:35.994
What?

49:36.127 --> 49:37.797
Daddy, l'm thinking about
becoming a Nun,

49:37.930 --> 49:39.633
and would love to volunteer
at Immaculata.

49:39.765 --> 49:40.867
He don't know?

49:40.999 --> 49:43.237
No. Now he thinks l'm the team Nurse.

49:43.369 --> 49:44.437
Does Coach know?

49:44.570 --> 49:48.244
Yeah. She said we'd wait for
a quiet moment to let him know.

49:49.608 --> 49:53.215
So, when did you... know?

49:54.079 --> 49:56.184
l'd been with this ad agency for...

49:56.482 --> 50:00.189
four years,
finally got my first big promotion,

50:01.086 --> 50:03.524
and l felt, nothing.

50:03.823 --> 50:08.098
l woke up the next day, and, thought.

50:08.294 --> 50:10.631
There has to be
more to life than this?

50:10.763 --> 50:12.266
So you just... Ieft?

50:12.398 --> 50:15.270
Well, the first thing l did
was break up with my boyfriend.

50:15.601 --> 50:17.171
You had a boyfriend?

50:19.672 --> 50:22.077
l was menh-six and living
in Manhattan.

50:22.308 --> 50:23.877
So. do, do you ever miss it?

50:24.443 --> 50:25.611
Sometimes.

50:26.712 --> 50:30.152
But, my whole life l had listened
to others tell me what l should do.

50:31.117 --> 50:35.391
And this time, l listened to
that little voice inside of me.

50:35.521 --> 50:36.456
Uh.

50:38.157 --> 50:41.429
So, l quit my job and took
a bus to Immaculata.

50:41.660 --> 50:42.728
Why there?

50:43.262 --> 50:48.005
l had this great, Immaculate Heart
of May Nun, in high school.

50:48.134 --> 50:50.938
She whispered something to me
that l'll never forget.

50:52.738 --> 50:54.976
Jesus likes to dance.

50:56.809 --> 50:58.913
That's how l reacted too.

50:59.078 --> 51:01.582
lt forever changed the way
l look at things.

51:01.747 --> 51:03.952
Like, the whole wedding
an canna thing,

a good time and wanted to stay.

51:08.654 --> 51:10.357
Oh, it sounds just like Ed.

51:10.589 --> 51:15.866

He really loves to dance.

51:18.899 --> 51:20.368
Have you told him lately??

51:22.601 --> 51:23.536

51:38.684 --> 51:40.154
That's why l'm asking.

51:42.856 --> 51:45.126
Since when did you become
so perceptive?

51:46.760 --> 51:51.769

keep your eye on the ball, Coach.

51:57.737 --> 52:01.878
So, you think you'll stay?

52:02.876 --> 52:04.578

Thanks for asking about my game.

55:55.910 --> 55:57.312
You're welcome.

56:49.163 --> 56:50.331
Where did you guys meet?

56:50.563 --> 56:52.033
At a basketball campus.

56:52.199 --> 56:54.837
Did you know right away
that he was the one?

56:55.770 --> 56:56.771
l did.

56:57.437 --> 56:58.973
How did he propose?

56:59.306 --> 57:00.909
What makes you think he proposed?

57:01.876 --> 57:02.811
Really?

57:03.010 --> 57:05.114
No, but l thought about it.

57:05.980 --> 57:07.717
Was it fun shopping for a dress?

57:08.282 --> 57:09.384
Well, my Mother made it.

57:09.650 --> 57:10.952

57:44.552 --> 57:46.021
No one's seen her all day.

57:46.387 --> 57:47.890
Well, was she in class?

57:49.023 --> 57:50.593
No, Coach, she wasn't.

57:55.663 --> 57:56.865

58:55.055 --> 58:56.223
Oh, hello, Coach.

58:56.690 --> 58:57.792
Thanks for coming.

58:57.925 --> 58:59.027
She still in bed?

58:59.193 --> 59:01.531
Yes. Come in.

59:09.136 --> 59:10.272
Hey, Coach.

59:11.473 --> 59:12.675
We missed you today.

59:14.975 --> 59:15.976
l'm sory.

59:18.280 --> 59:19.749
Give us a few minutes.

59:19.880 --> 59:21.283
She's a mass.

59:31.959 --> 59:33.094
You okay?

59:34.329 --> 59:35.197
Yeah.

59:44.506 --> 59:46.843
Breaking up is the worst.

59:47.841 --> 59:49.978
l know there is nothing
l can say right now

59:50.111 --> 59:51.713
to make you feel better, but...

59:51.845 --> 59:53.782
l just loved him so much.

59:55.250 --> 59:58.889
Hey. What are some of the things
he's going to miss about you?

01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:02.324
Right now? Nothing.

01:00:02.457 --> 01:00:06.631
Not true.
What makes you such a special person?

01:00:09.598 --> 01:00:13.439
l know the anmer
but l want you to tell me.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.371

01:00:16.605 --> 01:00:17.606
Okay.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.377
And l think
l'm a prem good dancer.

01:00:20.874 --> 01:00:24.181
You know, for a Catholic girl.

01:00:24.346 --> 01:00:25.514
Go on.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:33.394
And l... and l think l'm prem,
probably not right now.

01:00:33.521 --> 01:00:38.264
You are. All of those things,
even right now.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.628
And, what you think of
yourself

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.832
is way more important
than what he thinks of you.

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:46.701
This isn't you.

01:00:47.369 --> 01:00:50.274
Don't let his jacket define
who you are.

01:00:56.744 --> 01:01:00.118
This is who you are.

01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:02.450
Ty it on.

01:01:07.422 --> 01:01:08.757
Might be easier
if you stand up.

01:01:19.733 --> 01:01:21.336
You've earned this jacket,

01:01:22.037 --> 01:01:26.712
and nobody can take it
away from you. Right?

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:29.980
The team's waiting for you.

01:01:32.213 --> 01:01:33.381
Coach.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:36.485
Thank you.

01:02:08.883 --> 01:02:10.620
l've already phoned
our Sisters in Baltimore.

01:02:10.752 --> 01:02:14.058
Good. Now let's go
talk to Mother Superior, huh?

01:02:14.623 --> 01:02:18.964
Come on. It'll be all right.
Trust me.

01:02:20.428 --> 01:02:22.966
The ah,
retiring Nuns will move together

01:02:23.098 --> 01:02:25.603
and live at the Mother House.

01:02:25.735 --> 01:02:30.811
Excuse us... but we have some
vey exciting news to share.

01:02:30.939 --> 01:02:32.308
We're in a meeting here.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.947
l understand, but we got invited to
the Regional Championships. Huh.

01:02:36.077 --> 01:02:39.984
Well, that's vey nice, Mrs. Rush,
but now is not the time.

01:02:40.115 --> 01:02:42.118
What year are you in, young lady?

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:44.755
Oh, ah, l'm not a student, Mr. McHail.

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:47.123
And, l know it's Mr. McHail,
cause l go to your bank.

01:02:47.255 --> 01:02:49.994
l, l cash my checks there.
My own paycheck.

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.995
We coach the basketball team,

01:02:52.127 --> 01:02:54.799
we got invited to the Regionals
in Baltimore.

01:02:54.929 --> 01:02:57.233
We just needed some more money
to get the kids there.

01:02:57.566 --> 01:03:00.070
Mrs. Rush, l'm afraid at this time,

01:03:00.201 --> 01:03:02.839
we have more important issues
to deal with.

01:03:02.971 --> 01:03:05.041
There has to be
something we can do?

01:03:05.441 --> 01:03:08.914
Please except my apologies
for this interruption.

01:03:09.043 --> 01:03:11.313
Would you please excuse us?

01:03:14.883 --> 01:03:17.655
We can't give up,
we've worked too hard.

01:03:17.787 --> 01:03:19.590
You must leave now.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.793
Do you understand the commitment
these girls have made?

01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:24.026
Young lady, l don't believe you

01:03:24.159 --> 01:03:26.597
understand the meaning of
the word, commitment.

01:03:26.729 --> 01:03:28.966
lf it means not giving up when
no one else believes in you,

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:33.339
and, and, and, if it means showing up
evey daywhen all hope seems gone.

01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:35.505
Then l do know what it means.

01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:38.576
But, l didn't really understand that
until l got here.

01:03:39.575 --> 01:03:40.944
l know you're tying to
save this place,

01:03:41.075 --> 01:03:42.878
but the only way
to protect these girls

01:03:43.011 --> 01:03:46.485
and to protect your future
is to make them stronger.

01:03:46.715 --> 01:03:49.353
And, we do that by working together.

01:03:49.518 --> 01:03:53.592
There will always be other people
who think they have a better plan,

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:59.098
but at some point, we have to
stand up for what we believe in.

01:04:00.161 --> 01:04:02.666
My goals are
no dimerent than yours.

01:04:06.034 --> 01:04:07.237
Good afternoon.

01:04:20.048 --> 01:04:22.920
We will have three offers
before the end of the day.

01:04:30.793 --> 01:04:32.196
Who put this here?

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.102
Who's button is this?

01:04:42.338 --> 01:04:45.911
Well, we're not going to eat
until someone steps forward.

01:04:56.951 --> 01:04:58.554
lt must be yours.

01:05:09.365 --> 01:05:11.535
We can't really call it
a rematch then.

01:05:11.966 --> 01:05:13.469
No, ah, but ifwe win,

01:05:13.602 --> 01:05:15.639
we'll get one of the melve
automatic bids for the nationals.

01:05:15.771 --> 01:05:18.076
lfwe lose, we meat it out with
the rest of the county.

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:19.944
Four large bids.

01:05:21.577 --> 01:05:23.647
His wife was Immaculata.

01:05:23.779 --> 01:05:25.916
No kidding. Excuse me.

01:05:28.851 --> 01:05:31.189
Ah, l already have one of those.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.691
Oh no, it's not for you,
it's for your wife.

01:05:35.892 --> 01:05:37.094
Thank you.

01:05:59.715 --> 01:06:01.652

We can win this thing.

01:06:07.189 --> 01:06:07.522

01:07:06.616 --> 01:07:10.824
Right to get open.

01:07:11.588 --> 01:07:13.524
Get in there.

01:07:19.361 --> 01:07:20.496

01:11:19.369 --> 01:11:21.106

we can put you in the back,

01:11:21.238 --> 01:11:22.206

01:11:22.338 --> 01:11:23.941
Ah, we're, we're fine.
Go ahead and take the picture.

01:11:24.074 --> 01:11:26.445
l, l'd like to mitch her
with somebody from the back.

01:11:26.576 --> 01:11:27.244
All right, we're, we're good. Okay.

Sir. What?

01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:34.855

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.692
Honey. It's okay, just...

01:11:38.922 --> 01:11:41.259
Will you open the door? Trish.

01:11:41.357 --> 01:11:42.425
Trish.

01:11:48.364 --> 01:11:49.065
Come on.

01:12:23.934 --> 01:12:24.869
Let's go.

01:12:25.703 --> 01:12:26.638
We're ready.

01:12:36.347 --> 01:12:38.919
The first game is in less
than fom-eight hours.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:43.389
l have evey sympathy
with your cause, but...

01:12:44.488 --> 01:12:48.361
here you are,
you of all people should know

01:12:48.492 --> 01:12:52.700
we don't have the money for these...
recreational activities.

01:12:55.899 --> 01:12:56.767
l have an idea.

01:12:59.336 --> 01:12:59.770
Here?

01:12:59.903 --> 01:13:00.704
Yeah.

01:13:00.904 --> 01:13:02.641
Okay, wait, what are
we supposed to say to people?

01:13:02.773 --> 01:13:03.841
l've never done this before.

01:13:04.074 --> 01:13:08.783
Well, l have.
Soothing, feminine appeal.

01:13:09.046 --> 01:13:11.551
Okay. Okay.

01:13:22.793 --> 01:13:23.761
Can l help you?

01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:27.131
Hi.

01:13:28.065 --> 01:13:30.169
Good afternoon, my friend and l...

01:13:30.301 --> 01:13:33.039
...are selling Men's soothing creams.

01:13:33.371 --> 01:13:34.473
Yeah, for just a dollar,

01:13:34.605 --> 01:13:37.644
it's pemect for things like
dy hands, dy elbows...

01:13:37.841 --> 01:13:38.342
Oh yeah?

01:13:38.475 --> 01:13:39.877
And dy feet.

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.782
And...
you know what, it might help if...

01:13:42.913 --> 01:13:46.387
my friend Lizanne here could,
put some on your feet.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.755
Thank you.

01:13:53.324 --> 01:13:55.461
Sir, you forgot your lotion.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.875
How does it feel?

01:14:11.675 --> 01:14:14.147
Ah, great, great.

01:14:14.379 --> 01:14:15.547
You're doing great.

01:14:19.317 --> 01:14:22.089
We could only sell enough
for four one way tickets.

01:14:24.021 --> 01:14:27.026
And you know,
mo Sisters can apply for free.

01:14:27.392 --> 01:14:28.827
That's still not enough.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.330
Even ifwe left now
and drove through the night,

01:14:31.463 --> 01:14:34.101
we would be in no condition
to play the number mo seat.

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:41.907
Are you sure
we've done evemhing we can?

01:15:08.765 --> 01:15:11.403
This should be enough to
get your players there.

01:15:17.608 --> 01:15:19.044
Be not afraid.

01:15:29.254 --> 01:15:30.789
Final boarding call to Chicago.

01:15:30.922 --> 01:15:32.624
Final boarding call to Chicago.

01:15:32.756 --> 01:15:34.159
Final boarding call to Chicago.

01:15:43.767 --> 01:15:45.504
You know this is a sin, right?

01:15:47.472 --> 01:15:50.812
Ohhh, l intend on paying them back.

01:15:50.942 --> 01:15:52.377
l'll hold you to that.

01:15:55.179 --> 01:15:56.581
l have a confession.

01:15:57.081 --> 01:15:58.716
The habit will do that to you....

01:15:59.884 --> 01:16:01.453
l'm not Catholic.

01:16:03.154 --> 01:16:04.456
What?

01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:06.793
l'm Baptist.

01:16:07.725 --> 01:16:08.525
You are?

01:16:08.659 --> 01:16:09.862
Uh huh.

01:16:11.662 --> 01:16:14.367
But... you, you believe?

01:16:16.801 --> 01:16:18.470
Above all else.

01:16:23.374 --> 01:16:25.077
Then we are Sisters.

01:16:26.878 --> 01:16:29.082
Standby passengers,
Sister Sunday, Standby passenger,

01:16:29.213 --> 01:16:31.116
Sister Catherine to Atlantic Cih.

01:16:32.717 --> 01:16:33.718
Amen.

01:16:34.886 --> 01:16:36.188
Don't you get hot in these things?

01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:37.791
lt ain't easy, Sister.

01:16:41.225 --> 01:16:45.032
Open, open, go, go.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.270
Break the ball, break the ball.

01:16:53.938 --> 01:16:55.473
Hit it. Yes.

01:16:55.608 --> 01:16:57.545
Go with it, go with it.

01:16:57.842 --> 01:16:59.946
That's the way girls, that's the way.

01:17:05.717 --> 01:17:08.121
Hands up, hands up.

01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:14.394
Crush her, crush her, crush her.

01:17:15.927 --> 01:17:16.628
Crush her.

01:17:19.931 --> 01:17:23.103
That's right, push it, push it.
Come on.

01:17:42.887 --> 01:17:44.490
-Right. Yes.
-Yes.

01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:48.026
Ed, we got your order.

01:17:48.159 --> 01:17:49.261
Thanks.

01:17:49.628 --> 01:17:53.836
You tell me if Immaculata won.
Yes! Thanks.

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:13.252
lmmaculata is clinging on to

01:18:13.385 --> 01:18:16.089
a one point lead at the final minute of play.

01:18:16.954 --> 01:18:18.724
Don't give up the base line.

01:18:18.856 --> 01:18:19.791
...that the heavily favorite,

01:18:19.924 --> 01:18:23.163
Mississippi State dribble the ball,
side to side.

01:18:23.295 --> 01:18:24.830
The fans are on their feet.

01:18:24.929 --> 01:18:27.668
And that's mostly to defend the ball.

01:18:27.865 --> 01:18:31.339
Dribble private a pass shot is up
and good, and a foul.

01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:35.211
Oh no.
Mississippi State takes the lead.

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.746
There's the foul shot,
it's up and good.

01:18:38.943 --> 01:18:41.548
lmmaculata now trails by mo.

01:18:44.048 --> 01:18:46.453
And the Macs
push the ball up the court.

01:18:46.585 --> 01:18:50.091
On three, on three. Okay.

01:18:51.557 --> 01:18:53.861
Looking, looking for the open shot.

01:18:54.025 --> 01:18:58.901
Pass to Lizanne Caufield,
she's clear, it's up, it's good.

01:18:58.963 --> 01:19:02.035
lt's good. The match is tied up.

01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:05.139
Vey, vey, vey good. All right.

01:19:05.437 --> 01:19:08.442
This is what
we've been working for all year.

01:19:08.674 --> 01:19:11.279
This is why we have made sacrifices.

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:16.219
To defend this moment, right now,
and we are ready, okay?

01:19:16.348 --> 01:19:18.685
Remember, push the ball left,
move those feet,

01:19:18.816 --> 01:19:20.653
and know your teammates
are there to help you.

01:19:20.785 --> 01:19:21.720
Here we go.

01:19:23.088 --> 01:19:26.327
One, mo, three, team.
Get out there.

01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:29.764
Well folks, it looks like it'll
come down to one final play to see

01:19:29.894 --> 01:19:33.234
who will advance to
the National Championship game.

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:38.005
Mississippi State races up the floor.

01:19:38.203 --> 01:19:39.838
More to the left, more to the left.

01:19:39.972 --> 01:19:45.248
There's a pass. A dribble drive.
And Macs poke it free.

01:19:45.544 --> 01:19:46.947
Loose ball!

01:19:49.982 --> 01:19:51.484
The Macs have it.

01:19:53.552 --> 01:19:54.487
Shot!

01:19:58.957 --> 01:20:01.761
No good, no good.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:05.866
No good, and we're headed to
overtime, but wait, wait

01:20:05.998 --> 01:20:07.734
The Referees confer.

01:20:09.535 --> 01:20:11.005
What's wrong, Coach.

01:20:13.472 --> 01:20:16.946
Before the end of regulation,
foul to one.

01:20:17.309 --> 01:20:19.579
The Macs have one more chance.

01:20:23.315 --> 01:20:25.018
Number 12, you pick the court.

01:20:25.751 --> 01:20:28.556
Trish Sharkey's going to
go to the line for mo.

01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:32.494
Going to make that
Ionely walk out to the free throw line.

01:20:32.691 --> 01:20:34.661
There's a lot of
pressure on a young girl.

01:20:50.509 --> 01:20:51.510
And she misses.

01:20:51.643 --> 01:20:53.814
Time out, time out. Come on.

01:20:55.147 --> 01:20:56.382
Have a seat, have a seat.

01:20:56.515 --> 01:20:57.283
l'm fine, l'm fine.

01:20:57.416 --> 01:20:58.518
Here's some water.

01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.721
Listen to me, you can do this, Trish.

01:21:00.854 --> 01:21:03.091
Just trust your shot,
bend your knees.

01:21:03.222 --> 01:21:07.063
And, don't forget to breathe.
All right? Good.

01:21:08.627 --> 01:21:09.930
All right, let's go.

01:21:10.062 --> 01:21:14.170
Here we go again,
Sharkey walks the plank.

01:21:14.266 --> 01:21:17.105
She's now four for nine
from the Charih stripe.

01:21:24.576 --> 01:21:25.344
She dribbles.

01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:31.784
Shoots.

01:21:34.519 --> 01:21:35.722
lt's good.

01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:40.360
Yes. Yes.

01:21:42.227 --> 01:21:46.034
Finally, Immaculata College
is going to the finals.

01:21:46.532 --> 01:21:47.867
One more.

01:21:50.202 --> 01:21:55.880
Light another candle, Sister Regina,
this dream is still alive.

01:21:56.975 --> 01:21:58.812
What if they full court press?

01:21:59.512 --> 01:22:03.486
We go upside down, oven mitts on,
center and forward bring the ball up,

01:22:03.616 --> 01:22:06.020
Trish and Rosemay are
speed to go to the basket.

01:22:06.151 --> 01:22:07.687
What if they don't press?

01:22:08.888 --> 01:22:11.158
We put the winter clothes on.

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.794
l don't know that one.

01:22:15.093 --> 01:22:19.969
lt means, it'll be a cold day in hell,
she'll never adjust.

01:22:26.873 --> 01:22:27.941
l think we're ready.

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:32.012
Guess we're about to find out.

01:22:37.583 --> 01:22:39.218
No matter what happens tomorrow,

01:22:40.687 --> 01:22:43.191
l want to thank you for
what you've done for me this year.

01:22:43.623 --> 01:22:47.464
You are a team player,
you have helped the helpers.

01:22:47.627 --> 01:22:48.160
No. You don't need to...

01:22:48.293 --> 01:22:49.094
No, no, no, no.

01:22:49.227 --> 01:22:51.498
You listen to me, Cathy Rush.

01:22:51.864 --> 01:22:55.471
You taught me,
that not only is change possible,

01:22:56.936 --> 01:22:58.673
it's as vital as breathing.

01:23:00.205 --> 01:23:05.549
And, not only that,
you also taught me and all my Sisters

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:09.784
that sometimes Angels
wear high heels.

01:23:09.949 --> 01:23:12.688
This is the corniest thing
l have ever heard.

01:23:29.836 --> 01:23:36.683
Do you not know that in a race,
all the runners compete.

01:23:38.244 --> 01:23:41.450
But only one receives the prize.

01:23:42.849 --> 01:23:48.059
So, run that you may obtain it.
Corithians.

01:23:48.855 --> 01:23:51.160
You've earned the right to run tonight.

01:23:51.891 --> 01:23:54.229
And it's okay to want the prize.

01:23:57.964 --> 01:24:02.873
Lizanne, do you know
why teams get to the championship?

01:24:03.236 --> 01:24:04.271
Trust.

01:24:05.772 --> 01:24:08.344
Yeah, that's why they
get to the championship.

01:24:09.142 --> 01:24:12.314
Do you know
why they win the championship?

01:24:15.348 --> 01:24:16.450
Anyone?

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:24.961
l want all of you
to point to yourselves.

01:24:32.098 --> 01:24:33.400
That's right.

01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:36.470
Look where you're all pointing.

01:24:40.807 --> 01:24:41.808
This.

01:24:41.942 --> 01:24:48.587
This is why, this is
where championships are won.

01:24:50.283 --> 01:24:53.555
One team, one beat.

01:24:54.922 --> 01:24:58.094
This is what keeps us alive,
but we can't even see it.

01:25:00.426 --> 01:25:05.002
It's not about what we wear
or where we live,

01:25:05.131 --> 01:25:07.134
or how much money we have.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.070
That's how they see us.

01:25:09.202 --> 01:25:11.673
That's how they judge us.

01:25:12.205 --> 01:25:14.877
None of that matters.

01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:21.421
Because, what they don't know
is that we will win tonight.

01:25:21.681 --> 01:25:26.257
And we will win because of
the things they cannot see.

01:25:27.788 --> 01:25:29.557
One minute.

01:25:34.928 --> 01:25:36.163
Coach.

01:25:44.805 --> 01:25:47.810
Eveyone. Take a knee.

01:25:53.113 --> 01:25:54.749
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

01:25:54.882 --> 01:25:57.019
and welcome to
the First National Championship

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:59.789
for Women's college basketball.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.857
Tonight, it's histoy in the making,

01:26:01.989 --> 01:26:05.228
as the Golden Rams of
West Chester State College

01:26:05.358 --> 01:26:08.497
face the Macs of
Immaculata College.

01:26:10.263 --> 01:26:13.135
The tension is building here inside the arena

01:26:13.266 --> 01:26:16.606
as the Immaculata faithful rise to their feet.

01:26:17.938 --> 01:26:20.743
And the Mighh Macs
are taking the floor.

01:26:21.008 --> 01:26:23.680
This is one of
the most improbably championship

01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:25.914
match ups in sports histoy.

01:26:26.046 --> 01:26:30.889
The pint size Papal institution
received one of the four large bids

01:26:31.018 --> 01:26:35.059
and was seated in number fifteen
out of sixteen teams.

01:26:35.254 --> 01:26:38.159
lt was just one week ago
that these mo teams

01:26:38.291 --> 01:26:40.896
played for an automatic
bid to the Nationals,

01:26:41.028 --> 01:26:44.267
and Immaculata lost
by fom-mo points.

01:26:44.397 --> 01:26:46.568
How will this faimale end?

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:49.906
Will the glass slipper fit head
Coach Cathy Rush

01:26:50.037 --> 01:26:52.074
and her little sisters of the floor?

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:56.380
The anmer lies somewhere
bemeen Heaven and the hardwood.

01:26:57.010 --> 01:26:57.978
You got to go.

01:26:58.244 --> 01:27:00.882
Westchester State
usually ins the championship.

01:27:01.748 --> 01:27:02.983
lt's pushing forward.

01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:08.392
That's an easy layup
...setting up the defense.

01:27:08.622 --> 01:27:10.759
Macs are fighting to get open.

01:27:11.558 --> 01:27:12.626
Get it to her...

01:27:13.827 --> 01:27:17.200
And a... they're tying to
get it in, passed the ball to...

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:19.000
and the Golden Rams steal it.

01:27:25.038 --> 01:27:28.043
To the net... to the net. The net.

01:27:30.477 --> 01:27:34.351
Macs stay in bounds,
quick passed the middle.

01:27:34.548 --> 01:27:35.650
Vey nice.

01:27:35.749 --> 01:27:40.358
...move the ball up the floor.
Here's another pass and they score.

01:27:40.454 --> 01:27:45.730
Yes, that's teamwork.
Here we go. Yes. Yes, yes.

01:27:45.859 --> 01:27:47.862
lmmaculata pressuring the ball.

01:27:47.995 --> 01:27:51.736
The Macs are all over the floor...
coasted free.

01:27:51.865 --> 01:27:56.173
And the floor, picking up loose ball,
bounce by layup, score.

01:27:59.873 --> 01:28:01.843
They're putting the ball around.

01:28:01.975 --> 01:28:03.978
Moore pass the ball down to
Trish Sharkey...

01:28:04.111 --> 01:28:06.583
Yes, yes, there we go.

01:28:06.713 --> 01:28:07.781
Macs tie it up.

01:28:07.914 --> 01:28:10.953
Westchester wastes no time
getting down the floor.

01:28:11.585 --> 01:28:13.655
They shoot. And a foul.

01:28:13.787 --> 01:28:15.089
Are you kidding me?

01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:16.623
Come on!

01:28:16.757 --> 01:28:19.128
Head Coach Rush doesn't like that.

01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:24.833
Westchester dribble, mings it,

01:28:24.965 --> 01:28:27.804
Macs rotate to help,
there's Moore with a steal.

01:28:27.934 --> 01:28:31.274
Passes the head,
Macs look to push over half court.

01:28:31.405 --> 01:28:36.248
Exhibit... rainbow.
And a pot of gold.

01:28:37.344 --> 01:28:39.381
The Macs tie it again.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.617
Westchester controls.

01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:44.385
Slide your feet...

01:28:45.552 --> 01:28:46.921
Yes, stay right there.

01:28:49.623 --> 01:28:52.228
Open jumper, she nails it.

01:28:52.626 --> 01:28:54.863
Westchester leads by mo
in a minute

01:28:54.995 --> 01:28:56.732
and a half left to go on the game.

01:28:57.030 --> 01:29:00.404
Find Rosemay, Gail.
Find her. Search.

01:29:02.569 --> 01:29:04.739
Jump shot. We're tied again.

01:29:04.871 --> 01:29:06.107
There we go.

01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:08.109
That's it.

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:12.316
Macs with the ball, a chance to lead,
time's running down.

01:29:15.716 --> 01:29:19.190
Sharkey, a jump shot,
and it drops through.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.057
Macs take the lead by mo.

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.393
Thim five seconds to count.

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:25.793
Westchester in ah...

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:29.966
foul line, jumper.

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:30.765
Good.

01:29:30.897 --> 01:29:32.100
We are tied.

01:29:32.766 --> 01:29:34.402
Sixteen seconds.

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.104
Fourteen.

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:37.838
Thirteen.

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:41.877
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in.

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.779
Time out, Cathy Rush.

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:47.817
Jen, you're in. Okay, listen up.

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:50.052
We'll start fourteen low.

01:29:50.617 --> 01:29:53.422
Rosemay, l want you to
hand off to Gail.

01:29:53.787 --> 01:29:55.892
Trish, l want you to flash to the ball.

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:57.592
They're going to be
overplaying with Jen.

01:29:57.724 --> 01:30:00.296
l want you to set a back door screen.
All right.

01:30:00.427 --> 01:30:02.832
You need to trust
that Trish will be there.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:04.499
Let's do this.

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:06.401
Be strong, Trishy.

01:30:06.533 --> 01:30:08.570
-All right, on three.
-Ready?

01:30:08.702 --> 01:30:12.042
One, mo, three, charge.
Come on, let's go.

01:30:19.513 --> 01:30:24.456
Here we go, for evey team that
thought they never had a chance.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:31.627
Twelve seconds.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:33.627
Ten.

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:38.335
lmmaculata sets up along the baseline.

01:30:42.536 --> 01:30:44.239
And now they motion.

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:49.644
Five seconds.

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:55.551
Sharkey lays it up.

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.554
lt's good.

01:30:59.153 --> 01:31:00.956
Yes, yes.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:06.432
lmmaculata College
has won the National Championship.

01:31:06.727 --> 01:31:09.766
The Mighh Macs are number one.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.368
Nice game.

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:23.882
We did it, we did it.

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:36.991
Congratulations, Coach.

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:45.100
When l look back,

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:50.308
l'm not sure any of us could explain
the mystey of how we won,

01:31:50.439 --> 01:31:52.676
or why we won.

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:55.712
But maybe,
all we did was look around us

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:59.216
to see other women committed
to something they believed in.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:03.086
Somewhere along the way
you forget how important that is.

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:05.422
As a team,
we must have learned from that,

01:32:05.487 --> 01:32:06.655
because in the end,

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:10.728
it proved to all of us
that anything can happen

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:12.895
when we're committed to our dreams.

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.626
lmmaculata College survived
the turmoil of the early seventies.

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:47.533
ln 2005, it went co-ed and is
now thriving as Immaculata Universih.
