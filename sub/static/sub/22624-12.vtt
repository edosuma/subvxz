WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:06.174
-This is "X" marks the spot.
-Yup.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.309
Let's get that can down hole,
and find this thing.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.377
We're good to go, guys!

00:19.853 --> 00:22.790
It was one of the things
Fred found on the island.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.293
Is this the key
to unlock the mystery?

00:25.326 --> 00:26.660
Is this the key
to Nolan's Cross?

00:31.499 --> 00:34.268
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.302 --> 00:37.805
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:37.838 --> 00:40.541
for more than 200 years.

00:40.574 --> 00:44.078
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.112 --> 00:46.580
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:46.614 --> 00:50.084
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.118 --> 00:53.854
and a lead cross
whose origin may stretch back

00:53.887 --> 00:56.490
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.859
To date, six men have died

00:58.892 --> 01:01.095
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.098
And, according to legend,

01:04.132 --> 01:07.335
one more will have to die

01:07.368 --> 01:10.638
before the treasure
can be found.

01:23.551 --> 01:27.521
As a new day begins
on Oak Island,

01:27.555 --> 01:31.292
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
are more convinced than ever

01:31.325 --> 01:36.164
that they are close to solving
the 223-year-old mystery.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.805
Just one week ago, while
excavating a shaft known as H-8

01:44.838 --> 01:47.875
at a depth of some 170 feet,

01:47.908 --> 01:50.711
the team encountered evidence
of what they believed

01:50.744 --> 01:53.581
was the so-called
Chappell Vault,

01:53.614 --> 01:56.850
the mysterious seven-foot-tall
box first discovered

01:56.884 --> 01:58.786
by treasure hunters
William Chappell

01:58.819 --> 02:02.523
and Frederick Blair in 1897.

02:02.556 --> 02:06.527
But when the drill team from
Irving Equipment, Limited tried

02:06.560 --> 02:08.762
to penetrate the wooden object,

02:08.796 --> 02:11.499
they were shocked to learn
that not only did

02:11.532 --> 02:14.802
their massive steel caisson
fail to enter the vault,

02:14.835 --> 02:18.706
it actually pushed it farther
down and out of its path.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.708
Something was in front
of the can,

02:20.741 --> 02:22.510
and we were pushing it
for a while,

02:22.543 --> 02:24.212
and that's when
the drilling got tough.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.514
Oh, it's still in there, then?

02:26.547 --> 02:28.282
Just pushed to the side.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.619
NARRATOR: An even bigger setback
to the team

02:31.652 --> 02:33.387
occurred during a meeting
in the war room

02:33.421 --> 02:36.324
while choosing
the next drill site,

02:36.357 --> 02:39.560
when Rick and Marty's friend
and partner Craig Tester

02:39.593 --> 02:41.795
announced that he would be
leaving the island

02:41.829 --> 02:43.697
for the remainder
of the summer.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.734
I make a motion we dig one more
well yet this year, right here.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.569
Do I have a second?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.338
Well, it's up to the other guys
around this table,

02:50.371 --> 02:52.706
because when I'm headed out
of here, I'm probably...

02:55.243 --> 02:58.412
...not coming back this year.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.715
You'll always be here,
whether you're here or not.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.384
RICK:
The Testers, they have suffered

03:03.417 --> 03:05.419
a great loss with Drake.

03:05.453 --> 03:06.954
He loved this place,
he loved working

03:06.987 --> 03:08.422
with his father
and his brother.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.758
So we are pushed, if you will,

03:10.791 --> 03:12.760
to complete the task at hand.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.628
MARTY:
This is a chance to finish it.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.998
You know, I don't know
how to say it exactly,

03:18.031 --> 03:21.969
but I kind of want to try
and finish this for Drake.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.404
Can we name it
after my brother, too?

03:23.437 --> 03:24.438
MARTY:
Of course you can.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.939
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.275
Let's find it.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.842
For everyone.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.911
MIKE J.: Let's take it down
nice and slow.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.248
NARRATOR: Now, while the team
from Irving Equipment, Limited

03:34.282 --> 03:37.885
continues the preparations
for the new, steel-cased shaft,

03:37.918 --> 03:39.720
known simply as D.M.T....

03:39.753 --> 03:41.755
MIKE J.:
Right there!

03:41.789 --> 03:44.525
...brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

03:44.558 --> 03:47.695
along with their team,
have gathered in the war room,

03:47.728 --> 03:50.798
hoping to obtain new
information on what may be

03:50.831 --> 03:54.802
the most important discovery
ever made on Oak Island:

03:54.835 --> 03:57.471
a lead cross.

03:57.505 --> 04:01.442
So, look, we're all very
intrigued by, by the cross.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.344
The person that we should
reference, really,

04:03.377 --> 04:04.745
is Jerry Glover.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.348
He gave us access to--

04:07.381 --> 04:10.451
or got us access to the prison
tower in Domme...

04:10.484 --> 04:12.453
-ALEX: Mm-hmm.
-...and, uh, Alex,

04:12.486 --> 04:14.622
I believe he has sent you
some follow-up photographs.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.490
-You want me to get him
on the phone? -Absolutely.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.792
I think we all should have
some questions for him.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.061
-Okay.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.063
: Hello?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.064
JERRY:
Yes, I'm here.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.899
Holy...

04:25.933 --> 04:28.769
Holy schmoly, all right.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.738
NARRATOR:
Just one week ago,

04:30.771 --> 04:33.941
while exploring the shoreline
along Smith's Cove,

04:33.974 --> 04:38.512
Rick Lagina and metal detection
expert Gary Drayton found

04:38.546 --> 04:40.614
the mysterious lead object

04:40.648 --> 04:43.651
near the area where,
just one year earlier,

04:43.684 --> 04:46.854
they had found evidence
of an ancient irrigation system

04:46.887 --> 04:48.656
known as a French drain.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.391
How old?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.360
GARY: I would say
that is somewhere between

04:52.393 --> 04:55.529
1200 and 1600.

04:55.563 --> 04:58.065
I've seen that shape before.

04:58.098 --> 05:02.636
I saw a carving like that
in the Templar prison in Domme.

05:02.670 --> 05:07.708
NARRATOR: Incredibly, the cross
was an almost exact match

05:07.741 --> 05:10.478
to carvings made by members
of the Knights Templar,

05:10.511 --> 05:13.914
which Rick Lagina and two of
his nephews were recently shown

05:13.947 --> 05:16.617
by Templar expert Jerry Glover

05:16.650 --> 05:21.555
on the walls of a 14th century
prison in Domme, France.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.758
First time that came out
of the ground,

05:24.792 --> 05:26.927
I said I had seen that before.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.531
So here is
the side by side image.

05:32.733 --> 05:36.003
That is strikingly similar.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.506
I mean, it's not similar,
it's identical,

05:38.539 --> 05:40.374
as far as I'm concerned.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.476
Jerry, I believe we've sent you

05:42.510 --> 05:45.679
a photograph of the cross,
and we were wondering, you know,

05:45.713 --> 05:47.581
what your thoughts were on it.

06:29.156 --> 06:33.093
MARTY: So, Jerry, I'm looking
at this pillar, from England,

06:33.126 --> 06:37.164
and these pellets, and the sort
of crosses with the bases,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.933
also match a lot
of the graffiti in Domme.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.770
Do you draw any conclusion
from that?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.649
Seems a fair conclusion, yes.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.464
Hmm.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.132
ALEX: Jerry,
is it fairly conclusive, then,

07:12.165 --> 07:14.935
that the graffiti
is contemporaneous

07:14.968 --> 07:16.970
with the inscription of 1416?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.772
Is that for sure?

07:18.806 --> 07:22.175
Or is that, uh, to the best
of our knowledge?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.120
Yeah, that's what
I was gonna say.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.836
So if this is the same symbol
that we're seeing in Domme,

07:48.869 --> 07:51.204
and in the pendant, you know,
is that of any meaning

07:51.238 --> 07:53.173
if we try to put
a tentative date on our pendant?

08:01.749 --> 08:05.586
Who might be wearing such
a thing or having such a thing?

08:21.001 --> 08:24.204
NARRATOR: Depictions
of Jesus Christ on a cross,

08:24.237 --> 08:26.239
also known as a crucifix,

08:26.273 --> 08:29.910
date as far back
as the second century.

08:29.943 --> 08:33.080
Those made of lead, and most
resembling the one found

08:33.113 --> 08:37.217
at Smith's Cove, were also
known as mortuary crosses,

08:37.250 --> 08:39.920
and were generally worn
during times of plague

08:39.953 --> 08:43.957
in an effort to ward off
evil and disease.

08:43.991 --> 08:48.629
The thing is very curious,
especially, you know,

08:48.662 --> 08:51.031
the obvious question is,
how in the heck did it end up

08:51.064 --> 08:53.100
on a beach in Nova Scotia?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.736
-JERRY: It's very unusual.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.839
If you had to opine,

08:58.872 --> 09:02.209
is it Templar, likely Templar,
or more generically Christian?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.778
Could you call it
a Templar cross?

09:16.189 --> 09:19.059
We're gonna have to have experts
give us an opinion,

09:19.092 --> 09:24.698
people who are, uh, very well
versed in religious iconography,

09:24.732 --> 09:27.100
but the 13th century, really?

09:27.134 --> 09:30.771
It's surely a very,
very significant discovery,

09:30.804 --> 09:33.707
but again,
in terms of its connection

09:33.741 --> 09:35.208
to a specific theory,

09:35.242 --> 09:36.777
I don't think we're there yet.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.078
RICK:
Well, I'll tell you what, Jerry,

09:38.111 --> 09:40.681
we will continue our research.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.250
If you have any more information

09:43.283 --> 09:46.086
that you think
we may find of interest,

09:46.119 --> 09:47.621
please remain in touch.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.389
We, on our end,
as this moves forward,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.391
we will stay in touch with you.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.962
I'm sure you'd be interested
in whatever results we find.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.329
-Thank you again,
from all of us. -Thank you.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.031
-ALEX: Thank you, Jerry.
-GARY: Cheers, Jerry.

09:58.065 --> 10:02.002
He said it's probably medieval,
it's ancient.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.637
Everything he said
was consistent,

10:03.671 --> 10:05.639
so we're gonna keep going
with that.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.675
See where it leads,
as you always say.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.677
Look, the obvious conclusion

10:09.710 --> 10:11.078
-is to keep pursuing this.
-Yeah.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.412
We're not gonna
get it done sitting here.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.714
Back to it.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.256
NARRATOR: While his brother
remains on Oak Island

10:23.290 --> 10:26.994
to supervise operations
at the Money Pit site,

10:27.027 --> 10:30.831
Rick Lagina and Charles
Barkhouse have traveled

10:30.864 --> 10:34.434
some 50 miles north
to Waverley, Nova Scotia.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.404
They have arranged
for what they believe

10:37.437 --> 10:39.439
will be
a very important meeting

10:39.472 --> 10:42.209
with fellow Oak Island
property owner Tom Nolan,

10:42.242 --> 10:45.713
the son of legendary
treasure hunter Fred Nolan,

10:45.746 --> 10:49.683
who passed away
early last year.

10:49.717 --> 10:54.354
RICK: I do think that the torch
has been passed to Tom

10:54.387 --> 10:56.423
-from his father.
-Yeah.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.391
And my hope is that he'll say,
"You know what?

10:58.425 --> 11:02.229
"As a way to honor my father
and my father's legacy,

11:02.262 --> 11:07.467
-you know, I'll work in concert
with you guys." -Yeah.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.402
RICK:
Oh, T.J. Nolan Construction.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.806
This would be it.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.944
I was hoping to work with Fred,
and now we've lost part

11:16.977 --> 11:19.346
of what my brother calls
"The Fellowship of the Dig,"

11:19.379 --> 11:22.482
in that we would include
Mr. Nolan in that.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.418
Now Tom will take his seat
at the table, hopefully.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.491
-TOM: Hey.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.093
How you doing?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.161
-Good to see you again.
-Hey, Rick.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.162
-Good.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.363
-Hi, Tom.
-Charles.

11:36.396 --> 11:40.100
-Yeah.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.470
How's things going
on Oak Island today?

11:43.503 --> 11:46.306
Ah, you know, the Oak Island,

11:46.339 --> 11:49.009
what I call
the emotional roller coaster.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.812
I wish I had "X" marks the spot,
as you well know.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.114
It's-it's... I mean, your father
spent a lifetime doing this.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.816
-TOM: Oh, sure.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.284
I mean, it's been a part
of my life, you know,

11:57.317 --> 11:59.753
as long as I can remember.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.189
I don't know if I have the
passion for the treasure hunting

12:02.222 --> 12:04.825
Dad had, but,
you know, certainly,

12:04.858 --> 12:08.896
it's-it's always interested me
and probably always will.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.098
This has to be a bit emotional
for you...

12:11.131 --> 12:14.434
-Oh, it is. -...to look
at your father's life's work.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.438
He spent hours, untold hours,
working on this.

12:18.471 --> 12:23.376
Unfortunately, he just did
not... bring it to an end.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.246
-Yeah.
-So... here we are.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.781
Here we are.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.052
You know, it's-it's my hope
that we can,

12:32.085 --> 12:34.087
in some way, shape or form,
work in concert,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.256
work together to solve this.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.258
Whatever I can do,
Rick, you know,

12:38.291 --> 12:40.861
to try to help you guys
to facilitate this thing

12:40.894 --> 12:44.064
and hopefully bring it
to an end once and for all.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.167
You know, I'll gladly step up.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.036
What I'm really hoping
to see are...

12:49.069 --> 12:50.137
You'd like to look at the maps.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.538
I would. Absolutely.

12:51.571 --> 12:55.042
Okay.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.044
We have seen them
for a short period of time.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.180
-Yes. -You know,
your father came down.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.916
Well, what these are,
I mean, these are basically

13:02.950 --> 13:06.987
50 years of-of his work,
you know, his survey work

13:07.020 --> 13:09.957
down in the island,
you know, plotting everything

13:09.990 --> 13:11.458
he thought was important.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.226
-This is...
-You-you ran through the fields.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.528
-You were cutting some of this.
-Yeah, I spent my time

13:15.562 --> 13:18.866
with the mosquitoes in the woods
cutting survey lines,

13:18.899 --> 13:23.003
but, no, the actual survey work
was Dad, you know, 100%.

13:30.343 --> 13:35.148
Wow.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.051
TOM: These are basically
50 years of his work,

13:38.085 --> 13:41.254
plotting everything
he thought was important.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.123
You know, the fieldwork
would all be, uh,

13:43.156 --> 13:46.059
recorded in his books
and then put on the maps.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.528
RICK: Look at the amount
of survey lines on this map.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.497
CHARLES:
There's hundreds.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.600
It was a lifetime
to put it together.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.036
NARRATOR:
A land surveyor by trade,

13:56.069 --> 13:58.238
Fred Nolan first
became involved

13:58.271 --> 14:00.908
in the Oak Island mystery
when he was invited

14:00.941 --> 14:04.978
to create a detailed map
of all 140 acres of the island

14:05.012 --> 14:08.481
by M.R. Chappell in 1961.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.384
After purchasing
six four-acre lots

14:11.418 --> 14:14.354
near the middle of the island
in 1963,

14:14.387 --> 14:16.957
Fred spent over half a century

14:16.990 --> 14:20.660
plotting evidence
of possibly man-made markers.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.396
He also made numerous
significant discoveries,

14:23.430 --> 14:27.134
including Nolan's Cross.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.570
You know, I guess as a surveyor,
Dad got caught up

14:30.603 --> 14:33.573
in what he saw and thought,
you know,

14:33.606 --> 14:35.342
there's something to this

14:35.375 --> 14:37.677
from a, from an engineering,
surveying background.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.680
You know, that's what
drew him to it.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.549
RICK: When Tom unrolled
the first map,

14:42.582 --> 14:44.451
my thought was, "My goodness.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.054
There's an enormous amount
of information here."

14:47.087 --> 14:48.688
It's bittersweet.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.623
Here's the maps.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.592
We have now complete
and total access to them.

14:52.625 --> 14:56.363
And yet, we've lost
the interpreter of the maps.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.531
We've lost Fred.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.369
I very much look forward
to coming to some understanding

15:02.402 --> 15:04.537
of where these maps may take us.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.706
I mean, I have-- as you
well know, and you do, too--

15:06.739 --> 15:08.475
an interest in the swamp.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.510
I believe the swamp
hides some secrets.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.445
You do, too.
You've spoken of it.

15:12.479 --> 15:16.149
Yeah. I think the swamp's a...
it's a, it's, you know,

15:16.183 --> 15:18.685
it's a strange place.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.054
I mean, we drained it
in the '70s a couple times,

15:21.088 --> 15:23.590
and, uh, you know, Dad believed
there was something,

15:23.623 --> 15:25.525
something hidden in it.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.460
You were part of your
father's process, were you not,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.997
about locating
the survey stakes?

15:30.030 --> 15:32.132
Mm-hmm. Yeah. We found,
you know, the lines,

15:32.165 --> 15:35.402
the lines of stakes
out in the swamp.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.437
NARRATOR:
During his exploration

15:37.470 --> 15:40.073
of the mysterious
triangle-shaped swamp,

15:40.107 --> 15:43.543
Fred Nolan discovered a number
of identical, evenly spaced,

15:43.576 --> 15:46.413
wooden stakes that
were later carbon-dated

15:46.446 --> 15:49.749
to as early as the 1500s.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.419
Based on his professional
experience,

15:52.452 --> 15:56.223
Fred was convinced that he had
found the actual survey markers

15:56.256 --> 15:59.259
used centuries ago
to help create the boundaries

15:59.292 --> 16:01.261
for what he strongly believed

16:01.294 --> 16:05.065
was an artificial
body of water.

16:05.098 --> 16:09.302
These stakes were there and they
formed a perfect, perfect lines,

16:09.336 --> 16:11.671
as if they were set
by a surveyor.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.107
Is some of that data
on the maps?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.375
It's all in the maps.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.146
It's all there.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.181
Let's put this together.
Let's put it to bed.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.682
TOM:
Absolutely. Let's do it.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.317
That's great, guys.
Look, before you go,

16:24.351 --> 16:26.186
there's just something
I wanted to show you.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.789
One of the things
Fred found on the island.

16:29.822 --> 16:35.628
I don't know exactly when,
but it's a key.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.398
And it's, uh,
I know when you look at it,

16:38.431 --> 16:40.100
you're going to find it
very interesting.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.206
I've never seen anything
like that before.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.777
It's a folding skeleton key.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.080
It's something
I had never seen before.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.416
It has a cross in the blade
of the skeleton key,

16:56.449 --> 16:57.817
and when you fold the key,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.652
you can see the cross
in the handle.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.055
All of that
is very interesting.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.224
NARRATOR:
A skeleton key?

17:04.257 --> 17:08.195
Found on Oak Island?

17:08.228 --> 17:11.431
Also known as a passkey,
the use of skeleton keys

17:11.464 --> 17:14.501
dates back
to the eighth century BC

17:14.534 --> 17:17.404
with the invention of the first
bronze and iron keys

17:17.437 --> 17:20.240
during the Roman Empire.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.475
Stripped down to their
most essential parts,

17:22.509 --> 17:25.745
a narrow shaft and
single rectangular tooth,

17:25.778 --> 17:29.849
they served as universal master
keys that could open and close

17:29.882 --> 17:33.653
numerous locks on everything
from doors to safes

17:33.686 --> 17:37.257
or as a pick for thieves who
wanted to break into them.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.560
But what was a skeleton key
doing on Oak Island?

17:40.593 --> 17:42.695
Could it have been used to open

17:42.729 --> 17:46.533
a number of different treasure
chests buried centuries ago?

17:48.635 --> 17:52.239
-CHARLES: The fact that it folds
is very curious. -RICK: Mm-hmm.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.141
It's unique.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.875
In many ways it's emblematic

17:55.908 --> 17:58.645
of what we just proposed to do.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.680
I-Is this the key
to unlock the mystery?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.782
Is this the key
to Nolan's Cross?

18:02.815 --> 18:04.851
I mean, working together,
I think we can do this.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.453
-Yeah.
-Together.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.421
And again, thanks for the trust.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.557
-Maybe this is the start
of something. -Absolutely.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.764
NARRATOR: One day
after their productive meeting

18:17.797 --> 18:22.169
with Tom Nolan, Rick Lagina
and Charles Barkhouse arrive

18:22.202 --> 18:26.273
at the home of Oak Island
resident Dave Blankenship.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.541
-Hello.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.177
I don't have your spendables,

18:30.210 --> 18:32.912
but this might lead you
to the spendables.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.182
This is Mr. Nolan's maps.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.285
NARRATOR: Now,
armed with Fred Nolan's maps,

18:38.318 --> 18:42.189
Rick is eager to examine them
for possible clues.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.224
There's a lot of information
on here,

18:44.257 --> 18:46.593
-as you well know.
-Mm-hmm.

18:46.626 --> 18:50.363
So, why don't we, uh,
take a look.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.599
To be able to hold,
in our hands,

18:52.632 --> 18:55.235
Fred's life's work,
it's almost, uh,

18:55.268 --> 18:58.205
bequeathed to us from beyond
the grave.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.674
Here's a man who committed
a large portion

19:01.708 --> 19:05.478
of his adult life to this
passion, to this pursuit.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.614
And there's an enormous amount
of information,

19:07.647 --> 19:10.483
and enormous doesn't begin
to quantify

19:10.517 --> 19:13.286
Fred's 50 years of research.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.656
I can't even imagine how much
work was done.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.626
Look at, look at the amount
of survey lines on this map.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.761
CHARLES:
There's hundreds.

19:21.794 --> 19:25.232
There's probably
a couple thousand here.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.201
He ran every one of these lines
physically through the island,

19:28.235 --> 19:30.803
and there are probably
thousands.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.673
Not every one was important.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.808
We're gonna have to parse out

19:35.842 --> 19:38.645
what's relevant
from what's not relevant.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.480
That's the initial process.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.415
Look over there.
Check that out.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.351
Look at the triangle
of stones right there.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.519
RICK:
I see that.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.855
There's so much information
on here.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.923
He must have surveyed
practically every rock

19:50.957 --> 19:52.959
that was visible
on his property,

19:52.992 --> 19:55.328
thinking it connected
to something.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.231
There's almost survey lines
to every rock that's here,

19:58.265 --> 20:00.500
that's on the surface,
obviously.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.602
Yep.

20:02.635 --> 20:06.339
NARRATOR: Unlike most Oak Island
treasure hunters,

20:06.373 --> 20:09.376
including his rival
Dan Blankenship,

20:09.409 --> 20:12.712
Fred Nolan believed the key
to solving the mystery

20:12.745 --> 20:16.316
could be found by examining
evidence above the ground,

20:16.349 --> 20:18.751
rather than below it.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.788
He also believed
that the real treasure site

20:21.821 --> 20:24.324
was likely to be found
at the swamp,

20:24.357 --> 20:27.394
rather than in the Money Pit.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.663
Here's what I think: I think
these are the survey stakes

20:30.697 --> 20:32.799
-they found. -CHARLES:
You think those are? Okay.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.934
Unless those are them
right there.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.437
Yeah, those.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.906
: If only he
were here. -CHARLES: I know.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.009
I would do anything for time
with him again.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.977
Me, too.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.481
There's information there,
but there's no legend,

20:48.515 --> 20:51.518
there's no scale,
there's no orientation.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.953
So, and there's a lot of work

20:53.986 --> 20:55.988
that remains to be done
with the maps

20:56.022 --> 20:59.326
before we actually use
the information in the field.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.662
We have to be diligent
and we have to be patient.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.798
His gift to us is
we have these maps,

21:05.832 --> 21:08.335
and now we can duplicate
his processes

21:08.368 --> 21:10.570
to see if these maps
are really to scale.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.038
Yeah.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.873
RICK: Look, we've done
as much as we can do.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.675
Let's roll 'em up
and get after it.

21:15.708 --> 21:23.450
CHARLES:
Okay.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.852
a moment
of great anticipation

21:25.885 --> 21:28.521
for brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina

21:28.555 --> 21:31.424
as they, along with
Charles Barkhouse

21:31.458 --> 21:34.394
and metal detection expert,
Gary Drayton,

21:34.427 --> 21:37.364
head to Lot 12 to begin
their new search efforts

21:37.397 --> 21:40.367
on property now belonging
to Fred Nolan's family.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.005
All right, guys.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.808
Today is the day. Right?

21:48.841 --> 21:51.711
Yup, I'm all for it.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.681
NARRATOR: For the first time
since Fred Nolan's death,

21:54.714 --> 21:57.884
his son Tom has granted
the team access

21:57.917 --> 22:00.887
to all of his father's
16 acres.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.755
This includes the areas

22:02.789 --> 22:04.857
where Rick believes
Fred made several

22:04.891 --> 22:07.594
of Oak Island's
most important discoveries,

22:07.627 --> 22:10.029
including Nolan's Cross.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.566
Here comes Jim with a backhoe.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.568
NARRATOR:
Tom has also arranged

22:15.602 --> 22:18.004
to have his associate,
Jim Meagher,

22:18.037 --> 22:21.007
aid the team's search efforts
using a seven-ton backhoe.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.143
Hey, Jimmy.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.847
How about if you just
dig a trench two feet down

22:27.880 --> 22:30.450
all the way to roughly
to where they're standing

22:30.483 --> 22:32.051
-JIM: Right.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.654
And we'll try to locate
where this thing might be.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.988
All right, sounds like a plan.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.028
NARRATOR:
Noted on Fred's maps

22:42.061 --> 22:44.897
as a location
of particular importance

22:44.931 --> 22:48.100
is an area the veteran
treasure hunter once described

22:48.134 --> 22:50.870
as an ancient dumpsite.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.139
It was here
that previous searchers

22:53.172 --> 22:56.409
reported finding evidence
believed to be connected

22:56.443 --> 23:00.146
to the original construction
of the Money Pit.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.815
Where is this dump?

23:02.849 --> 23:06.118
It's here.
You just haven't found it yet.

23:06.152 --> 23:11.090
MARTY: We have several sources
that describe a dump-like area

23:11.123 --> 23:14.160
right near Fred Nolan's house,
now Tom Nolan's house.

23:14.193 --> 23:17.163
We have Tom himself describing
his dad digging in there

23:17.196 --> 23:19.899
when Tom was a young-young lad.

23:19.932 --> 23:23.202
We're looking for clues
in that area

23:23.235 --> 23:26.839
as to what happened here
long ago.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.741
-So, Charles, you know,
about the dump... -Yeah.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.910
-I know there's not much
written about it... -No.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.545
...but what do you know?

23:32.579 --> 23:34.781
CHARLES:
Gilbert Hedden, in 1936,

23:34.814 --> 23:38.651
he finds shards of pottery
with traces of mercury in them,

23:38.685 --> 23:40.887
and mercury has actually been
found in the Money Pit, too.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.855
That goes back
to that whole theory

23:42.889 --> 23:46.526
of, you know, Sir Francis Bacon
preserving documents in mercury.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.029
NARRATOR: One of the
most persistent theories

23:50.062 --> 23:52.665
as to the origins
of the Oak Island mystery

23:52.699 --> 23:55.067
points to Sir Francis Bacon,

23:55.101 --> 23:58.538
the renowned 17th-century
philosopher, scientist,

23:58.571 --> 24:01.240
politician and nobleman.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.744
Bacon was also a leading member
of the Rosicrucians,

24:04.777 --> 24:07.213
a secret society
of intellectuals

24:07.246 --> 24:09.181
who were believed
to have come into possession

24:09.215 --> 24:10.983
of the priceless
religious treasures

24:11.017 --> 24:13.152
of the Knights Templar.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.154
Some researchers believe

24:15.187 --> 24:17.690
that Bacon was also
the secret author

24:17.724 --> 24:20.560
of the works credited
to William Shakespeare,

24:20.593 --> 24:23.195
and that he buried
both the Templar treasures

24:23.229 --> 24:27.199
and the original Shakespeare
folios on Oak Island.

24:27.233 --> 24:30.637
In his scientific work
Novum Organum,

24:30.670 --> 24:32.505
Bacon described a method

24:32.539 --> 24:34.574
of preserving documents
in mercury,

24:34.607 --> 24:38.878
allowing them to be securely
buried deep within the earth.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.013
Could the traces of mercury,

24:41.047 --> 24:45.184
discovered at the dump
by Gilbert Hedden in 1936,

24:45.217 --> 24:48.921
support the theory that
important historical documents

24:48.955 --> 24:51.591
could be hidden on Oak Island?

24:51.624 --> 24:54.293
And might that explain
why the Oak Island team

24:54.326 --> 24:56.128
found pieces of parchment

24:56.162 --> 24:58.297
and possible
leather bookbinding

24:58.330 --> 25:01.701
deep in the Money Pit area
earlier this year?

25:06.573 --> 25:09.742
Small, scrappy iron.
Let me get a pin point.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.046
Whoa.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.150
No. Crusty nail.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.688
Okay guys, trench time.

25:21.721 --> 25:25.324
All I'm picking up
is small nails.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.294
So I'll start at that end
and work my way back.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.863
We need some shiny gold things.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.132
-Something with a date on it.
-Yeah.

25:46.245 --> 25:50.583
I'm getting something here.
It's like iron.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.224
That's it. Yup. Square nail.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.260
I got some pottery here.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.062
-Yup.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.898
-Perhaps we could have a look.
-Oh, my God!

26:05.932 --> 26:08.601
I could have the whole
dinner service here. Look.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.170
-There's a big piece. Look.
-Yeah, definitely.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.805
Look.

26:14.974 --> 26:17.644
-Oh, wow, that's a lot of
pottery. -Look.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.612
Well, looks like
we've hit the dump, guys.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.353
-Oh. Another piece.
It's a pu-Ooh, more.of wood.

26:27.386 --> 26:30.823
-Here, take-take that.
-Good eye, Charles.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.860
I think you're
the pottery shard champ, now.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.628
I kind of, like,
hit the jackpot here.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.864
There's another little piece
right here.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.365
I think our dump
is right there, Rick.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.801
It's this perfect cross section,
we found it,

26:41.834 --> 26:43.202
it doesn't go through
to this way.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.737
You're finding all kinds
of bits of pottery

26:44.771 --> 26:47.039
-and stuff right there.
-Another piece.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.341
Locating the dump,
finding it,

26:49.375 --> 26:51.844
realizing that the stories
were true...

26:51.878 --> 26:54.380
Yeah, this is a successful day.

26:54.413 --> 26:57.349
We got to figure out
the oldest thing here,

26:57.383 --> 27:00.820
-because that might tell us
who was here... -RICK: Sure.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.321
-...at the times we're
wondering about. -RICK: Yup.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.056
-The date.
-Yup.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.092
-It's always about the dates.
-Mm-hmm.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.260
RICK:
From the beginning, we've tried

27:08.294 --> 27:10.730
to look to the past

27:10.763 --> 27:13.332
and tried to confirm
what the past has taught us,

27:13.365 --> 27:16.202
and now, today,
we've taken story,

27:16.235 --> 27:18.204
gone into the field,

27:18.237 --> 27:20.873
and corroborated
that the story is real,

27:20.907 --> 27:24.010
and that's important
as we move forward.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.746
NARRATOR: While Rick, Marty,
and members of the team

27:26.779 --> 27:29.081
continue their search
of the dumpsite

27:29.115 --> 27:33.820
on Tom Nolan's property...

27:33.853 --> 27:36.322
Alex Lagina and Jack Begley

27:36.355 --> 27:39.726
have traveled 60 miles north
to the Dawson Printshop

27:39.759 --> 27:41.994
at the Nova Scotia School
of Art and Design

27:42.028 --> 27:43.863
in the city of Halifax.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.131
Well, I'm anxious to meet him.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.699
This is, like,
right in his wheelhouse.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.939
NARRATOR: They are meeting
with Joe Landry,

27:52.972 --> 27:55.341
an expert
in medieval bookbinding,

27:55.374 --> 27:57.944
who specializes in the study
and restoration

27:57.977 --> 28:00.179
of ancient manuscripts.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.181
We have found some interesting
things

28:02.214 --> 28:04.717
that we think you'd
be able to help us with.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.318
Um, Jack's got them.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.387
And I would love
to take a look if we can.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.893
JACK: It kind of looks like it
could be some old parchment.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.261
NARRATOR:
Several weeks ago,

28:15.294 --> 28:16.763
while searching the spoils

28:16.796 --> 28:18.497
excavated from Borehole H-8

28:18.530 --> 28:19.999
in the Money Pit,

28:20.032 --> 28:22.334
Jack Begley and Dan Henskee

28:22.368 --> 28:26.739
discovered both parchment
and bits of leather--

28:26.773 --> 28:30.276
leather, which when examined
under an electron microscope,

28:30.309 --> 28:32.444
resembled possible
bookbinding material.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.884
-Please have a seat and we'll,
uh, have a look. -ALEX: Thanks.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.319
NARRATOR:
It is the team's hope that Joe,

28:40.352 --> 28:43.122
along with his apprentice,
Katherine Taylor,

28:43.155 --> 28:45.024
can make a positive
identification

28:45.057 --> 28:49.261
of these artifacts and perhaps
determine their origin.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.163
So we have what
we think is parchment

28:51.197 --> 28:54.066
and what we think is leather
from possibly a book-binding.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.868
Okay.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.971
The parchment? -Yeah, sure.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.440
So, there you go.

29:08.314 --> 29:11.083
Yes, yes.
This would be parchment.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.454
ALEX: I guess I've been burned
so many times in the past

29:15.487 --> 29:17.123
that I was almost
expecting him to say,

29:17.156 --> 29:18.424
"Oh, it looks like parchment,

29:18.457 --> 29:20.026
but, you know,
on closer examination,

29:20.059 --> 29:21.527
no, that's not what this is."

29:21.560 --> 29:23.796
However, what he told us is,

29:23.830 --> 29:24.864
"Yeah, this is parchment."

29:24.897 --> 29:26.532
He immediately recognized it.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.367
He said "Yup, that's exactly
what this looks like."

29:28.400 --> 29:30.302
-Now, this is, yeah... -Do you
want to take a look at this?

29:30.336 --> 29:32.204
-This is some of the leather
we found. -Oh, yes, yeah.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.106
JOE:
Yeah, so this-this is, uh,

29:34.140 --> 29:38.878
quite, uh, typical of
a vegetable tanned leather,

29:38.911 --> 29:42.281
espec-especially a calf or hide.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.083
This material lasts and lasts.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.085
I mean, one
of the suppliers I use

29:46.118 --> 29:49.555
when I'm restoring medieval
books sort of guarantees

29:49.588 --> 29:52.591
his alum-tawed skins
for 2,000 years.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.295
-Wow. -Whereas goat skins
are only good for 400, so...

29:56.328 --> 29:59.098
-Got to save those receipts.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.033
Yeah, so you better write
the receipts on parchment, too.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.601
-Yeah.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.203
We actually brought
one more piece, though,

30:04.236 --> 30:05.604
and we were wondering

30:05.637 --> 30:07.306
if you could give us
any information on it.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.075
This might be kind of
a long shot.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.544
Yeah. It's a purple piece
of wood. Any idea?

30:14.313 --> 30:17.583
Look at this, Dan. Purple wood.

30:17.616 --> 30:20.086
NARRATOR: Along with the samples
of parchment and leather

30:20.119 --> 30:24.056
found in the H-8 spoils,
Jack and Dan Henskee

30:24.090 --> 30:27.393
also discovered
a mysterious piece of wood,

30:27.426 --> 30:29.128
which appeared
to have been stained

30:29.161 --> 30:32.198
or dyed the color purple.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.233
DAN:
It's not a florescent, exactly,

30:34.266 --> 30:37.269
but it's definitely
an unusual purple.

30:37.303 --> 30:41.473
Um, this is also...
this color is very similar

30:41.507 --> 30:43.609
to an ink used in parchment.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.044
JACK:
Whoa.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.914
JOE:
This is from Egypt.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.548
ALEX:
How old is this scroll?

30:49.581 --> 30:51.483
Oh, 2,000 years.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.186
: My God.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.156
JOE:
The blue is tyrian blue,

30:57.189 --> 30:59.658
the royal blue that the church
and the royalty would use.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.094
It was quite literally worth
its weight in gold,

31:02.128 --> 31:05.264
-so it wasn't commonly used.
-Mm-hmm. -Boy, that's...

31:05.297 --> 31:07.266
-But it's amazing how similar
the colors are. -Yeah.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.635
Although I feel
it might be more likely

31:09.668 --> 31:12.104
from a, you know,
a vegetable source

31:12.138 --> 31:14.640
-like a rich, red wine, I think.
-Mm-hmm.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.909
JACK:
How often was

31:16.943 --> 31:18.177
this color purple used?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.679
Well, just in important
church documents

31:20.712 --> 31:22.648
and royal, you know, documents.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.383
You're kidding, right?

31:24.416 --> 31:27.553
Only for important church
and royal documents?

31:27.586 --> 31:29.455
That's right.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.161
It looks like the same color
as the piece of wood.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.695
ALEX:
It does look identical.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.231
NARRATOR:
Dating back over 3,500 years

31:39.265 --> 31:41.533
to the ancient Phoenicians,

31:41.567 --> 31:45.071
the production of purple dye
was so time-consuming

31:45.104 --> 31:47.573
and costly
that it was reserved for,

31:47.606 --> 31:50.642
and became
synonymous with, royalty.

31:50.676 --> 31:54.446
In fact, in the Middle Ages,
so-called "sumptuary laws"

31:54.480 --> 31:56.682
restricted the use
of purple dyes

31:56.715 --> 32:00.119
to those in the aristocracy.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.488
Could the presence
of this purple wood,

32:02.521 --> 32:05.992
along with parchment
and leather bookbinding,

32:06.025 --> 32:08.160
be evidence
that important historical

32:08.194 --> 32:12.965
or religious documents are
buried deep in the Money Pit?

32:12.999 --> 32:15.234
If this was a... a book board

32:15.267 --> 32:17.303
and it was covered with, uh,

32:17.336 --> 32:19.471
ecclesiastical purple leather

32:19.505 --> 32:21.540
and it got wet,
there could be staining.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.376
So, wait, hold on.
That seems important.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.713
This... there's leather
that's dyed this color?

32:27.746 --> 32:29.548
There is, yeah.

32:29.581 --> 32:32.151
And we have leather,
wood and parchment.

32:32.184 --> 32:35.254
You said that there's leather
stained that color.

32:35.287 --> 32:39.158
Is it possible that this wood...
is an analog for this wood here?

32:39.191 --> 32:42.094
The thickness is about right
for a book... book board.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.530
In combination, this is
the most exciting, that is true.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.398
-Yeah.
-'Cause without this,

32:46.432 --> 32:48.700
that could be a shoe, and...

32:48.734 --> 32:50.402
without these,
this isn't gonna tell us

32:50.436 --> 32:52.271
as much as...
as we want to know.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.405
ALEX:
I think Jack and I

32:53.439 --> 32:55.341
got some really good info today.

32:55.374 --> 32:58.344
We got a lot of answers, and
we had our theories confirmed

32:58.377 --> 33:00.212
about what these scraps
of leather and parchment

33:00.246 --> 33:01.613
really are.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.615
So I think the guys
back at the island

33:03.649 --> 33:05.551
are gonna be really interested
in what we learned.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.519
Of course, things just
keep getting more interesting.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.355
-Yeah.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.457
Well, that's-that's the nature
of the game, isn't it?

33:11.490 --> 33:13.625
You never know what's
gonna show up next week.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.227
We'll get out of your hair.
Thank you guys very much.

33:15.261 --> 33:16.295
Bye-bye, now.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.142
NARRATOR:
As Alex and Jack conclude

33:30.176 --> 33:33.145
their informative meeting
with Joe Landry,

33:33.179 --> 33:36.448
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton
head to the home

33:36.482 --> 33:40.819
of veteran Oak Island treasure
hunter Dan Blankenship.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.288
-RICK: Knock-knock.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.755
Come on in!

33:43.789 --> 33:45.457
Hi, Dan.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.359
What do you say, Rick?

33:47.393 --> 33:49.461
-Don't get up. Good.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.331
-Excuse me for not getting up.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.466
-No, no, you sit down.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.403
NARRATOR:
At the age of 94,

33:57.436 --> 33:59.671
Dan has spent
more than half a century

33:59.705 --> 34:02.708
living and working
on Oak Island,

34:02.741 --> 34:06.112
determined to solve
the 223-year-old mystery.

34:08.114 --> 34:11.283
Although not as active
in the search as he once was,

34:11.317 --> 34:13.419
Dan remains
an invaluable source

34:13.452 --> 34:15.487
of information and guidance

34:15.521 --> 34:17.856
to Rick
and the Oak Island team.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.759
We were out in Smith's Cove,

34:20.792 --> 34:23.529
and we were metal-detecting,
and I'd like to show you

34:23.562 --> 34:24.763
what we found.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.703
Look at that, Dan.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.514
*

34:53.192 --> 34:55.427
RICK:
Whenever we find something

34:55.461 --> 34:57.496
that we deem to be, uh,

34:57.529 --> 34:59.131
an important find,

34:59.165 --> 35:01.600
we always go to see
Mr. Blankenship.

35:01.633 --> 35:04.303
And we all find the cross
quite fascinating.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.804
It's a significant find

35:05.837 --> 35:08.307
in our opinion,
and we wanted to show it to Dan.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.242
Lead.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.477
-Yep, it's lead.
-Yep.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.180
I went to France,

35:14.213 --> 35:18.717
to a Templar prison,
and I saw something

35:18.750 --> 35:22.688
carved in the wall
exactly like that.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.624
I think I have a picture of it
here on the phone.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.559
*

35:31.797 --> 35:35.901
-This is the carving
in the prison walls. -Yeah.

35:35.934 --> 35:40.606
The Templars were
imprisoned there in 1307.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.943
The similarity of it
is striking, that's for sure.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.679
GARY: You know, I'll be honest,
I came here looking

35:47.713 --> 35:49.815
for basically pirate treasure,

35:49.848 --> 35:52.384
treasure coins, artifacts.

35:52.418 --> 35:55.587
I wasn't a big believer
in the Templar connection.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.457
That changed my mind.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.792
Never did I ever believe

36:00.826 --> 36:03.795
that I could find something
like this on Oak Island.

36:03.829 --> 36:07.899
Something like this here
substantiates that theory.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.736
-Just another piece of the...
-Yeah.

36:10.769 --> 36:14.706
of the puzzle that seems to...
to fall in.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.975
Well, we're gonna get
more than one, uh, expert

36:17.008 --> 36:18.777
to weigh in on this.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.313
There may be
some scientific method

36:21.347 --> 36:23.649
that can date lead--
I don't know if there is or not.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.751
My God, they poured lead.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.887
For hundreds of years,
they've poured lead.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.989
I don't how long they go back.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.424
A long time.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.859
It'll be interesting to see

36:33.892 --> 36:37.463
what the experts have
to say about this.

36:37.496 --> 36:40.432
-Very much so.
No question about that. -Mm.

36:40.466 --> 36:44.270
RICK: I came here
just absolutely committed

36:44.303 --> 36:46.572
to giving Dan and Fred
some answers,

36:46.605 --> 36:49.808
and unfortunately
Mr. Nolan has passed,

36:49.841 --> 36:51.710
and Dan is, uh...

36:51.743 --> 36:53.979
None of us are beating
Father Time.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.248
I mean, we're all
getting older, so...

36:56.282 --> 36:58.750
this could be an answer.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.686
We find something,
we'll be back.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.554
-Not if. When.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.490
Good to see you, Dan.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.866
SCOTT:
Down a little bit.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.304
NARRATOR: For Rick and Marty
Lagina and their team...

37:18.337 --> 37:21.039
-So it started.
-It has started.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.841
...the anticipation
for a major breakthrough

37:22.874 --> 37:26.978
in the Oak Island mystery
couldn't be higher.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.714
You go that way
just a little bit.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.816
DANNY:
Good.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.818
-Yeah.
-SCOTT: There it is.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.387
Today marks the beginning

37:35.421 --> 37:38.056
of their sixth massive
exploration shaft

37:38.089 --> 37:40.292
in the Money Pit area.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.528
Known as D.M.T.,

37:42.561 --> 37:45.531
the dig location has been named
for Craig Tester's son

37:45.564 --> 37:48.600
and Jack Begley's
stepbrother, Drake,

37:48.634 --> 37:52.404
who tragagally passed away
last year.

37:52.438 --> 37:55.874
-Mike. Morning.
-Rick. Morning.

37:55.907 --> 37:59.044
So, cans up?
Ready to start oscillating?

37:59.077 --> 38:00.746
She's ready to rock.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.814
RICK: Based on all
the information we know,

38:02.848 --> 38:05.584
based on last year's work,
based on this year's work,

38:05.617 --> 38:07.386
this is "X" marks the spot.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.755
-Yep.
-As good as we can discern.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.391
NARRATOR:
Using the information gained

38:12.424 --> 38:15.761
from the 44 exploratory
boreholes completed this year

38:15.794 --> 38:18.964
as a part of their
Geotech drilling program,

38:18.997 --> 38:21.733
the team has identified
the D.M.T. location

38:21.767 --> 38:24.069
as a promising search area,

38:24.102 --> 38:27.072
where they believe
the legendary Chappell Vault

38:27.105 --> 38:29.441
may have moved
after being dislodged

38:29.475 --> 38:32.077
during the excavation of H-8.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.079
RICK:
Now we know

38:34.112 --> 38:38.617
because of the work this year,
the pattern-drilling, the H-8,

38:38.650 --> 38:41.753
we're honed in on, if you will,
the bottom location

38:41.787 --> 38:44.089
-of Chappell's Vault.
-Mm-hmm.

38:44.122 --> 38:48.860
RICK: There's certainly still
questions swirling around H-8,

38:48.894 --> 38:50.662
and, you know,
I hate walking away

38:50.696 --> 38:52.731
with, uh, those...
those questions unanswered.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.500
And I do believe that...

38:54.533 --> 38:57.836
that, uh, the D.M.T. hole
holds much promise.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.473
RICK:
Look, everything's lining up.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.909
Let's get that can down hole
and find this thing.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.478
-We're ready to go. Thank you.
-Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.380
We're good to go, guys!

39:15.887 --> 39:18.657
Let's hope that D.M.T.
solves the puzzle.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.460
Hopefully his luck's
on our side.

39:21.493 --> 39:24.730
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
and the Oak Island team,

39:24.763 --> 39:28.400
digging the D.M.T. shaft
in the Money Pit area

39:28.434 --> 39:29.968
may be their final test

39:30.001 --> 39:33.839
in solving
the 223-year-old mystery.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.476
Will they soon find where
a vast treasure lies buried,

39:37.509 --> 39:39.411
a treasure consisting
of everything

39:39.445 --> 39:43.615
from valuable objects
to priceless documents?

39:43.649 --> 39:46.485
Treasure of historic importance

39:46.518 --> 39:48.887
brought to Oak Island
centuries ago

39:48.920 --> 39:52.023
and from thousands
of miles away?

39:52.057 --> 39:55.761
Or might they find
that the keys

39:55.794 --> 39:57.529
to unlocking
Oak Island's secrets

39:57.563 --> 40:00.766
lie somewhere much closer
to the surface,

40:00.799 --> 40:04.035
and in a different and more
ingeniously protected location

40:04.069 --> 40:07.105
than anyone ever knew?

40:10.108 --> 40:13.144
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

40:13.178 --> 40:14.846
We're on an obstruction.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.886
RICK:
Houston, we have a problem.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.654
-GARY: Oh!

40:26.592 --> 40:27.926
Yeah.
