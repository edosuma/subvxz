WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.500
I just want the plans, Venture.

00:04.620 --> 00:07.580
I have the plans right here,
Half-Jackal.

00:07.710 --> 00:09.210
Right here in my head.

00:09.340 --> 00:13.340
So why don't you keep trying
to beat them out?

00:13.470 --> 00:15.220
That baby's gonna kick like a virgin.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.640
You have to re-level quick.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.720
Go for the bastard's neck.

00:18.850 --> 00:20.390
Do I have to kill him?

00:20.520 --> 00:21.810
Keep him up there, Kano.

00:21.930 --> 00:24.060
I don't care if he wets himself
and your head.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.310
That boy is gonna
see somebody die.

00:26.440 --> 00:30.570
And if he doesn't want it to be
his father he's got to pull that trigger.

00:34.530 --> 00:35.610
Knew it.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.450
White, White, I've done it.

00:37.570 --> 00:41.080
Congratulations,
you've discovered pornography.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.700
Oh, that's unsavory.

00:42.830 --> 00:45.290
Quit it. This is serious.
You see what's written on that smoke?

00:45.420 --> 00:48.040
That's circumference and length.
It describes a cylinder.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.210
Billy, you've snapped.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.130
No, White.
This boy genius is sane.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.960
30 years of searching for clues...

00:54.090 --> 00:57.300
in the old Rusty Venture cartoon
has led me to this.

00:57.430 --> 00:58.640
Wow, impressive.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.930
It's a scytale,
a helical cipher.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.680
You just wrap this strip of paper...

01:02.810 --> 01:05.099
with what appears to
be nonsense around it...

01:05.230 --> 01:07.730
and Bingo was his name-o.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.860
Well?

01:09.980 --> 01:11.770
Don't tell me.
It's more code.

01:11.900 --> 01:15.320
It's all "form type equals address."

01:15.450 --> 01:16.610
I was so close.

01:16.740 --> 01:20.200
I'm already regretting telling you this,
but that's a URL.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.580
- What?
- Billy, it's a website.

01:21.700 --> 01:22.870
That's impossible.

01:22.990 --> 01:25.330
The Rusty Venture cartoon
is from the '70s.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.880
"52 equals country
equals U.S. and geodiff"--

01:30.000 --> 01:32.340
that's with two f's--
"equals one." You got it?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.460
Yeah, I got it.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.340
It's a maplook map.

01:36.470 --> 01:39.800
White? That's a map
to the Venture compound.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.640
Oh, my God, you're right.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.680
And look at that.

01:42.810 --> 01:45.810
I could save 1 .3 miles
if I take Ridge Street.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.730
The bricks on that
Mayan temple--

01:51.860 --> 01:54.150
random pattern or Morse code?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.150
Morse code. Slide.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.990
Do giant spiders really have
that many eyes?

01:59.110 --> 02:02.780
They do when it's code written
in Braille. Slide!

02:02.910 --> 02:05.990
That's a shirtless drunk albino, I think.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.910
- Spring break 1 994.
- Slide!

02:08.039 --> 02:11.750
Alright, Billy, all you've proved
is that you're way too into cartoons...

02:11.880 --> 02:14.710
and that I should find out why I haven't
seen dime one from those DVD sales.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.750
Wrong!

02:15.880 --> 02:18.630
Every one of these clues and hundreds
more like them have led me here--

02:18.760 --> 02:19.680
slide--

02:19.800 --> 02:21.970
to this spot in your compound
and the final clue.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.180
Yeah, that's my herb garden.
Doc, can we talk outside?

02:25.310 --> 02:26.350
You can say it to everybody.

02:26.470 --> 02:28.140
Oh, cool! Brock's gonna swear.

02:28.270 --> 02:29.270
No, he's not.

02:29.390 --> 02:32.190
Cool, Brock's gonna
talk about naked sex ladies.

02:32.310 --> 02:36.070
Alright, fine,
when I got assigned this ridic--

02:36.190 --> 02:37.940
important assignment...

02:38.070 --> 02:41.610
I was given explicit instructions
to watch that exact patch of ground.

02:41.740 --> 02:44.240
Sorry, I'm not digging there.

02:44.370 --> 02:46.370
Well, your employer is.

02:46.490 --> 02:48.250
See, we've already lost Brock.

02:48.370 --> 02:49.960
And who knows who's next?

02:50.080 --> 02:54.590
Any one of us could meet our demise
or be driven crazy by greed.

02:54.710 --> 02:56.460
The quest will not be easy.

02:56.590 --> 02:58.590
Look, Billy,
you just saw me ride a komodo dragon...

02:58.720 --> 03:01.090
and they have poisonous spit.

03:01.220 --> 03:05.050
Poisonous spit, infected mouths,
komodo dragons.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.810
It's-- if they bite you.

03:06.930 --> 03:09.730
Whatever. Nobody works as hard
as Rusty Venture.

03:09.850 --> 03:11.940
Hurry up. My ice is melting.

03:12.060 --> 03:15.440
I'm going as fast as I can.
Yell at Dean for once.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.480
Your brothef's
busy helping the grown-ups.

03:17.610 --> 03:19.110
I think I have heatstroke.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.400
You have lollygagger syndrome.
That's what you have.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.700
Here, freshen this up for Daddy. White?

03:23.820 --> 03:24.950
Sure, I'll take another Fanta.

03:25.070 --> 03:26.410
- Billy?
- What are you drinking?

03:26.530 --> 03:28.580
Red Mocho Cooler.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.710
It's Kahlúa, Hershey's syrup,
and a dash of red Kool-Aid.

03:32.830 --> 03:34.630
That sounds horrible.

03:34.750 --> 03:35.960
I just hit something.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.050
Oh, now we're talking.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.090
What? Oh, false alarm.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.590
It's a box full of old mops.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.720
It's a dog corpse.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.430
Well, looks like we found
where Brock buried Scamp.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.470
Scamp? No.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.730
No-o-o-o-o!

03:51.850 --> 03:54.980
Dean, less ice this time!

03:59.070 --> 04:01.190
Oh, come on!

04:02.400 --> 04:03.950
Oh, Brock, I'm glad you're here.

04:04.070 --> 04:05.740
This is yours, I think.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.120
It came from the past.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.660
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

04:10.910 --> 04:12.330
This is totally what we're looking for.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.500
I recognize it from episode 209--

04:14.620 --> 04:16.290
the Talking Cave Mystery.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.000
Whoa, is this Brock's room?
Sweet digs, Samson.

04:19.130 --> 04:20.170
Get out of here.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.920
I have a dart board like that.
You ever turn it around? Baseball.

04:23.050 --> 04:24.010
Yeah. Get out of here!

04:24.130 --> 04:26.510
Is this a rec room?
Please tell me there's bumper pool.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.810
Out of my room now, everybody!

04:30.930 --> 04:32.640
Look, I found even more
treasure in there--

04:32.770 --> 04:37.480
a mysterious card that says
"Ancient Gear Fist" and a coin.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.900
I'll bet it's Indian money.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.940
Look, a magic nurse shoe.

04:41.070 --> 04:41.980
That's my shoe.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.570
Hey, that's my Yu-Gi-Oh
card and my slammer pog.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.610
Aw, gyp.

04:45.740 --> 04:46.660
Dean, give me those.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.490
- What did I tell you about gambling?
- Gyp!

04:48.620 --> 04:49.490
Out!

04:49.620 --> 04:52.830
OK, before we open this...

04:52.950 --> 04:54.660
if it's gold or diamonds...

04:54.790 --> 04:56.870
I think it's pretty clear my father
meant for me to have them.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.630
And if poison gas
should come out and kill us...

04:59.750 --> 05:01.420
I just want to tell you that...

05:01.550 --> 05:04.170
I was the one who carved Dean's name
into the bathroom door.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.220
Thanks, Hank.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.550
I love you, Dean.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.470
OK, Billy, open it up.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.520
Oh, for the love of God.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.150
Was anybody else waiting for
their face to melt off, eh?

05:19.730 --> 05:21.730
The final clue.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.150
I can decode this.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
Get me a roll of toilet paper.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.490
Oh, and get me
another Red Mocho Cooler.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.030
Don't look around you,
man of the future.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.370
Sandow is speaking to you
from beyond the grave.

05:35.500 --> 05:39.880
The voice you now hear is coming
from the Victor talking mach--

05:40.000 --> 05:43.590
Duty that no man, dagger, bullet...

05:43.710 --> 05:45.960
or blow harmed Colonel Venture.

05:46.090 --> 05:48.930
Foolishly, Sandow believed the device...

05:49.050 --> 05:52.890
and my dreadful orders
to protect it to be a myth.

05:53.010 --> 05:54.260
That changed.

05:54.390 --> 05:56.180
Everything changed.

05:56.310 --> 05:57.930
Look out there, Lloyd.

05:58.060 --> 06:00.690
We're being attacked by members
of our own Guild.

06:00.810 --> 06:04.900
The only way we can gain control
is to activate the device now.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.820
I'm sorry.
I didn't know we were out of options.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.780
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was sarcasm day.

06:10.910 --> 06:13.740
I'm sorry I wasn't aware
of your delicate constitution.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.950
I'm sorry you
smell like spoiled fruit.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.330
Fantômas has a point.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.410
How dare you, sir?

06:18.540 --> 06:20.620
Why, I smell of freshly cut flowers.

06:20.750 --> 06:25.050
Not that.
Look, all of us have devoted our lives...

06:25.170 --> 06:27.260
to perfect and protect the Orb.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.550
But we're losing everything.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.800
Now, I can't even afford another suit.

06:31.930 --> 06:34.100
Same suit for the last five years.

06:34.220 --> 06:37.430
Samuel, the Orb is a source
of untold power.

06:37.560 --> 06:41.190
We must take our time and learn
how to harness that power...

06:41.310 --> 06:42.730
for the good of mankind.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.270
Whoa, there. Orb is ours.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.940
The Guild will decide
what is best for mankind.

06:49.070 --> 06:50.780
For shame.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.740
This Guild was founded
to protect and serve man at his best...

06:56.290 --> 06:59.580
not to be a guild
of calamitous intent.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.080
But...

07:02.210 --> 07:07.960
But-- and it's a bigger but
than the huge one I sit on--

07:08.090 --> 07:10.300
that little ball has to be tested.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.590
The ugly queen is right.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.600
I was the last to add my genius to Orb.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.810
And I, the great beast, Aleister Crowley...

07:19.930 --> 07:22.640
will prove the mighty art of hermetic--

07:22.770 --> 07:24.060
Whoa.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.730
Sandow, show that lunatic out.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.030
Let's see if the chubby wizard can fly.

07:29.150 --> 07:31.740
Alright there, big guy. I get the hint.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.280
No need to get shovey...

07:33.410 --> 07:38.450
because I will come down on you
like a storm! Aah!

07:38.580 --> 07:39.830
OK, you see?

07:39.950 --> 07:41.620
We can no longer trust anyone.

07:41.750 --> 07:44.370
It's time to harness the power of the Orb...

07:44.500 --> 07:46.500
whatever that power may be.

07:48.920 --> 07:53.010
Colonel Venture, it's Tesla,
and he's with the Avon ladies.

07:53.130 --> 07:54.590
They have us surrounded!

07:54.720 --> 07:56.800
To our gliders!

07:57.890 --> 08:00.850
Don't do it, Colonel Venture. I beg you.

08:00.980 --> 08:06.230
Sandow, my faithful bodyguard,
these are desperate times.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.320
Sandow knew what had to be done.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.940
Men like us follow orders.

08:12.070 --> 08:15.820
Yes, future man, we are pawns...

08:15.950 --> 08:21.160
but pawns that move
in that crazy "L" shape...

08:21.290 --> 08:23.040
like that horse piece.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.750
Oh, this thing is tiny.

08:24.870 --> 08:28.340
Sandow will pick this up
on the other cylinder. Sorr--

08:29.300 --> 08:31.000
Great.

08:31.130 --> 08:33.919
Alright, Hank,
read it one more time.

08:34.049 --> 08:37.549
"In Minuit's bargain
sits house that coke built.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.970
"In a loud room of quiet whistlers...

08:40.100 --> 08:45.350
"behind the wild gray gentleman,
sits the 22121 0."

08:45.480 --> 08:47.190
Alright. Googled Minuit...

08:47.310 --> 08:48.900
and he's the guy
who bought Manhattan Island...

08:49.020 --> 08:50.570
from the Indians with beads or something.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.690
So, Minuit's bargain
is New York City.

08:52.820 --> 08:53.740
Obviously.

08:53.860 --> 08:55.700
Man, the poor chump
who came up with this riddle...

08:55.820 --> 08:57.860
didn't bank on us having
the internet, eh?

08:57.990 --> 08:58.950
What's the next line?

08:59.080 --> 09:02.700
"In Minuit's bargain
sits house that coke built."

09:02.830 --> 09:03.870
I'm on it.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.660
"The house that coke built."

09:05.790 --> 09:07.210
No, that's the Cola.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.210
Wait. Studio 54, New York City.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.340
It's just like the old show.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.074

09:34.610 --> 09:38.570
"Rusty Venture,"
brought to you by-- smoking.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.280
This is tits.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.950
I'm in your old seat, aren't I?

09:43.080 --> 09:44.200
I don't remember.

09:44.330 --> 09:46.790
Alright,
time to put on our costumes, Rusty.

09:46.910 --> 09:47.870
Costumes?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.170
Did I say costumes? I meant disguises.

09:50.920 --> 09:54.130
Did any of you find
a tube about yea big...

09:54.260 --> 09:56.300
while you were digging up my garden?

09:56.420 --> 09:57.880
If you mean the roll...

09:58.010 --> 10:00.220
Dad and Mr. Billy took it to
New York City.

10:00.340 --> 10:02.050
Of course they did.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.310
OK, White, I'm taking off for a while.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.970
You're in charge of the boys.

10:06.100 --> 10:10.310
Right. Do they have a bedtime
or, uh, any dietary concerns?

10:10.440 --> 10:12.980
'Cause I've noticed Hank eats
a lot of refined sugars.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.480
You know what?
Never mind. I'll get Orpheus to do it.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.860
I can't believe you talked me...

10:17.990 --> 10:19.450
into wearing my old clothes.

10:19.570 --> 10:22.030
This is New York City,
the fashion capital of the world.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.030
Trust me, we'll blend in. I'm serious.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.620
Next season
will be all about the mancapri.

10:27.870 --> 10:29.830
Input voice identification.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.000
- Samson, Brock.
- Confirmed.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.420
Search Samson, Brock,
active assignment.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.380
Verify clearance level 8.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.380
John Bonham Rocks.

10:39.510 --> 10:40.510
Confirmed.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.640
Samson, Brock,
active assignment--

10:42.760 --> 10:44.350
Operation Rusty's Blanket.

10:44.470 --> 10:48.270
Subsearch Orders Regarding
Bodyguard termination clause.

10:48.390 --> 10:51.390
Clearance level 1 0
identification number required.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.520
Alright, hold on.

10:52.650 --> 10:54.810
- Incorrect identification.
- It wasn't a number--

10:54.940 --> 10:57.070
- Incorrect identification.
- I know! Knock it off!

10:57.190 --> 10:58.490
Incorrect identification.

10:58.610 --> 11:02.820
Uh, uh, 2, Delta, 9, Romeo, Tango, 8.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.530
Autopilot initiated.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.450
Agent Samson, Brock, terminated.

11:07.580 --> 11:12.330
Oh, what the...
Did you just fire me or kill me? Hello!

11:13.040 --> 11:14.330
You piece of shit!

11:16.500 --> 11:17.920
Come on!

11:20.880 --> 11:23.090
Argh! Ah!

11:26.810 --> 11:29.720
Hey, I know we
shouldn't be seen together, but, uh...

11:29.850 --> 11:32.890
well, I saw your
feature-dance here last week.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.060
Yeah? What'd you think?

11:34.190 --> 11:36.060
You like the part with the fan?
Never mind.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.530
Look, butter-top, the boss man's
watching me like a hawk.

11:38.650 --> 11:39.780
Better buy me a drink.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.860
What are you drinking?

11:40.990 --> 11:43.280
That son-of-a-bitch
silverback knows damn--

11:43.410 --> 11:45.410
Gin neat! You cretin!

11:45.530 --> 11:46.910
Alright, what's the skinny?

11:47.030 --> 11:48.120
You tell me.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.500
Sweet lord,
that hack actually found it?

11:50.620 --> 11:52.290
- Found what?
- Damned if I know.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.250
You want the bad news
or the good news first?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.330
I don't know--
the good, I guess.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.630
There is no good news!

11:57.750 --> 11:59.750
Just bad news and weird news.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.420
You were never assigned to protect
wee little Rusty Venture.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.260
You were assigned to protect
something else.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.430
Or maybe to protect us from
something else.

12:06.550 --> 12:07.470
What does that mean?

12:07.600 --> 12:10.930
It means that the man you thought
you had to protect is a godless idiot.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.980
His father hid
some rotten device from him.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.940
Guess he figured if he had
the noodle to find it...

12:15.060 --> 12:16.190
he'd know what to do with it.

12:16.310 --> 12:17.860
I'm also guessing he was wrong!

12:17.980 --> 12:19.440
Yep.

12:19.570 --> 12:20.650
That's the weird news.

12:20.780 --> 12:23.150
The bad news is that if he tries
to activate the device...

12:23.280 --> 12:24.450
you have to take him out.

12:24.570 --> 12:27.160
Before the O.S.I.
takes me out, I suppose.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.200
What do you want?
A moment to cry over a spilled life?

12:29.330 --> 12:30.290
You're a pawn, son.

12:30.410 --> 12:33.160
So, what is this device
I've been protecting?

12:33.290 --> 12:34.540
How will I even know
when I see it?

12:34.670 --> 12:35.710
Known the whole time.

12:35.830 --> 12:37.790
Operation Rusty's Blanket.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.590
Orders Regarding Bodyguard.

12:40.710 --> 12:43.010
Orb. That's all I know.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.170
You want any more information...

12:44.300 --> 12:45.720
you got to ask another Venture bodyguard.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.800
I can't.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.680
Doc took the second cylinder
to New York.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.810
Don't know what you're
talking about, and I don't care.

12:50.930 --> 12:53.020
You take this hot wad of cash
and do what you got to do.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.520
Don't you dare ask me what I did
to get those $1 00 bills.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.940
Mine is not to
poop on anyone's parade...

13:00.070 --> 13:02.820
but Studio 54?

13:02.940 --> 13:04.240
This box is from the Victorian era.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.030
Alright, fella, then
what do you think it is?

13:06.160 --> 13:08.570
This isn't my forte...

13:08.700 --> 13:10.450
but I know a cipher master...

13:10.580 --> 13:13.660
who knows the 1 9th century
like the back of his hand.

13:13.790 --> 13:15.160
I'll be right back.

13:15.870 --> 13:17.710
Cool. He's astral projecting.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.420
Dean, you know what to do.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.390
Oh, my God!

13:34.520 --> 13:36.600
What do you eat?!

13:38.810 --> 13:40.270
Wake up, fat boy.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.690
I have been waiting half my
life for this moment...

13:43.820 --> 13:46.900
but I never dreamed it would be
you they sent, Brock Samson.

13:47.030 --> 13:48.400
Look, nobody sent me.

13:48.530 --> 13:50.450
Wait a second.
I thought you were a mute.

13:50.570 --> 13:52.240
My silence was a choice.

13:52.370 --> 13:54.990
I have taken from this world a great man.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.750
My silence is my penance.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.500
Now end my suffering, O.S.I. man.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.290
Alright, look, I'm not here to kill you.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.670
I'm here because Doc
is looking for the Orb.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.710
Orb?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.130
Master Rusty has found Orb?

14:08.760 --> 14:11.090
Did he find it under the couch
while looking for change?

14:11.220 --> 14:15.180
Yeah, well, he's not
only looking for whatever the hell Orb is...

14:15.310 --> 14:17.890
but he has my
second gramophone cylinder.

14:18.020 --> 14:21.600
I don't even-- have a clue
what's going on here.

14:21.730 --> 14:24.230
Wait here. I have something for you.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.690
I tell you, Brock Samson,
it feels good to talk again.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.030
I've been holding so much in.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.610
Do you watch Top Chef?

14:31.740 --> 14:35.580
Uh, yeah, but I didn't like Top Design.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.950
Oh, it feels so good to talk.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.750
Let's go to karaoke bar.

14:39.870 --> 14:41.920
I so want to sing Humpty Dance.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.630
Uh...

14:43.750 --> 14:44.920
Yes, yes, we go later.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.170
First, you should listen to this.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.090
What is that? The other cylinder?

14:49.220 --> 14:50.840
Well, what the hell does Doc have?

14:50.970 --> 14:53.680
Knowing Rusty--
roll of toilet paper?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.640
- OK, "In Minuit's bargain..."
- Manhattan.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.350
- "...sits house that coke built."
- Studio 54.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.810
- "In a loud room of quiet whistlers..."
- Backstage in the bathroom.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.610
- "...behind the wild gray gentleman..."
- That guy.

15:05.730 --> 15:08.690
"...sits the 22121 0."

15:08.820 --> 15:11.320
Which has to be that
foldaway changing table.

15:11.450 --> 15:14.030
And I bet we already
know the model number.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.990
Oh, that is never not fun.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.000
Oh, oh, man.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.000
Orpheus, they TP'ed
your corporeal form.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.290
That is hilarious.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.340
Yes, of course. A regular panic.

15:26.460 --> 15:27.590
Oh, OK.

15:27.710 --> 15:31.340
So, why have you summoned
the alchemist?

15:31.470 --> 15:32.510
♪ Ba-daa! ♪

15:32.640 --> 15:34.260
To solve a mystery.

15:34.390 --> 15:37.010
The mystery of the box
we found in Brock's garden.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.970
Alright. Give me the clues.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.020
I'm on the job.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.390
Sandow thinks
it may not be a good idea.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.980
They're dying out there. All over this.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.570
- What is it?
- The Orb.

15:48.690 --> 15:50.900
Archimedes himself began
the construction...

15:51.030 --> 15:52.990
with little more
than the mirror alignment.

15:53.110 --> 15:56.370
Da Vinci added the gearings,
Newton the lenses...

15:56.490 --> 15:57.990
Galileo the prisms.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.330
All of the great poets,
painters, scientists...

16:01.460 --> 16:05.500
alchemists, and philosophers
have had the Orb in their hands.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.090
But what is it?

16:07.210 --> 16:10.550
Some say it's a weapon
of catastrophic proportion.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.220
I believe it to be a type of engine...

16:13.340 --> 16:15.470
self-sustaining
and of endless power.

16:15.590 --> 16:20.720
I believe this, Sandow,
because I am a man of hope.

16:20.850 --> 16:24.270
Colonel Venture, please don't activate it.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.350
Sandow, I must.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.190
Then so must Sandow.

16:30.320 --> 16:35.740
Sandow will forever carry this
burden like a--

16:35.860 --> 16:36.780
That's about it.

16:36.910 --> 16:40.450
The rest is Sandow listing
chocolate recipes.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.450
That's why I kept it. I like to bake.

16:42.580 --> 16:45.460
So, did you have to do it, too?

16:45.580 --> 16:48.460
Kano, did you kill the great
Dr. Venture Sr.?

16:48.590 --> 16:51.300
Oh, so, now you're a mute again.

16:51.420 --> 16:54.090
Well, at least we don't have
to sing karaoke now.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.180
Come on. Please?

16:56.300 --> 16:59.430
Studio 54 is the house that coke built?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.560
You guys went crazy from everything
after that guy that sold Manhattan.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.770
Yeah, I got that one.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.440
Alright, let's start again.
Get me a dictionary.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.849
We have the internet.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.980
I don't want to play
World of Warcraft.

17:10.109 --> 17:12.569
Get me a regular dictionary.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.440
Ugh. Internet.

17:14.569 --> 17:17.530
It's only good for finding out
that your boyfriend is sleeping around.

17:17.660 --> 17:18.819
Freaking Myspace.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.280
What? I'm not supposed to look
at his friends' comments?

17:21.410 --> 17:23.950
They're right on the first page.
That's hardly snooping.

17:24.079 --> 17:25.960
Alright. I have your antique.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.880
Look up "coke."
Give me the first definition.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.840
Hold...on. OK.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.670
"Noun. The residue of coal...

17:34.800 --> 17:38.800
"left after destructive distillation
and used as fuel."

17:38.930 --> 17:40.220
Who ever heard of that?

17:40.350 --> 17:43.640
Gentlemen, we need a coal magnate
with a home in Manhattan.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.480
Two points-- the alchemist.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.140
There's nothing in there but discotheque.

17:47.270 --> 17:48.730
It could be something small...

17:48.850 --> 17:51.060
like an IBM stock or something.
Keep looking.

17:51.190 --> 17:52.980
Hey, what do we got here?

17:53.110 --> 17:54.070
Is there a problem?

17:54.190 --> 17:56.240
No, officer, no problems here.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.240
Just, uh, changing my son.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.280
That's a mighty big boy you got there.

18:01.410 --> 18:04.490
Bet he's, uh, he's gonna be
a football star, huh?

18:04.620 --> 18:07.620
Well, don't let me disturb you. Carry on.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.460
OK, there, Billy. Up-a-bum.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.130
Lift your little fanny.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.750
Daddy's gonna change you now.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.920
This is how we lost George Michael.

18:17.050 --> 18:18.760
Come in, Boy Wonder,
this is control.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.220
Studio 54 is not the coke house.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.850
Head to the Frick museum on--

18:22.970 --> 18:24.350
What's that all about?

18:24.470 --> 18:27.350
My Nintendo DS Lite?

18:27.480 --> 18:28.730
Goo-goo, gaga.

18:28.850 --> 18:31.730
- Butter me, Hank. I'm on a roll.
- OK.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.150
Um, how?

18:33.270 --> 18:34.900
Alright, how is "wild"

18:35.030 --> 18:36.980
in the "wild gray gentleman"
spelled?

18:37.110 --> 18:39.150
Ye old-e-fashioned way.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.700
What the hell does that even mean?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.320
With an "e." You know, wild-e.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.200
That's not old-e fashioned.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.410
That's a surname.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.700
Oscar "ding-dong" Wilde.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.460
Alright, give me some time here.

18:49.580 --> 18:52.080
Control.
What is your 1 0-20, Boy Wonder?

18:52.210 --> 18:54.040
Hank, it's Brock. Where's your father?

18:54.170 --> 18:55.420
Kind of lost contact with him.

18:55.550 --> 18:58.050
But he should be going to
the Frick museum with Mr. Billy.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.420
Alright, book me on
the next flight to Laguardia.

19:00.550 --> 19:01.510
How?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.510
I don't know, Hank.
Get White to do it.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.010
Sweet pecan pie, I've solved it.

19:05.140 --> 19:06.930
Alright, now, try to keep up.

19:07.060 --> 19:10.100
"In a loud room of whistlers"
is the Whistler wing in the Frick.

19:10.230 --> 19:12.230
"behind the wilde gray gentleman..."

19:12.350 --> 19:15.520
refers to Whistlef's painting
of Robert de Montesquiou...

19:15.650 --> 19:17.900
the guy who was the model
for Dorian Gray.

19:18.030 --> 19:20.030
And who wrote
The Picture of Dorian Gray?

19:20.150 --> 19:21.400
Edgar Allan Poe.

19:21.530 --> 19:24.450
Not even close, Hank.
It was Oscar Wilde.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.490
So, "behind the wilde gray
gentleman" means...

19:27.620 --> 19:30.290
"behind the portrait of
Montesquiou." Get it?

19:30.410 --> 19:31.330
A-almost.

19:31.460 --> 19:33.710
Doesn't matter. Just call your dad.

19:42.550 --> 19:43.720
Billy, knock it off.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.640
You almost hit the painting
with your arrow.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.720
Don't even try to tell me...

19:46.850 --> 19:49.470
that hasn't been your fantasy
since you saw The Pink Panther.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.980
So, it's behind this?

19:51.100 --> 19:52.640
Alright, let's tear it down.

19:52.770 --> 19:55.270
Uh, don't you think we should check out
the room behind this...

19:55.400 --> 19:57.820
before we destroy a priceless masterpiece?

19:57.940 --> 19:59.610
Rusty's back.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.030
It's the old stuff, Billy.

20:02.150 --> 20:04.490
I'm feeling it again.

20:08.240 --> 20:13.580
Alright. "Behind the Wilde gray
gentleman sits the 22121 0."

20:13.710 --> 20:15.120
- Super.
- OK, I think I got something.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.540
The 22nd letter is--

20:17.670 --> 20:19.130
I got it! Billy! Billy!

20:19.250 --> 20:20.710
Keep it down.
We're in a museum.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
Trying to get us popped?

20:21.970 --> 20:23.970
Sorry. I cracked the final code.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.840
It was a simple substitution.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.640
We are looking for an Orb.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.810
Wow, you are back.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.480
Me and Rusty Venture
solving mysteries.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.560
We haven't found it yet,
so keep your pants on.

20:37.690 --> 20:40.440
Why? Are you planning on
taking them off again?

20:43.280 --> 20:44.900
Paperweight, my ass.

20:45.030 --> 20:47.660
Hello, sweet thing.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.280
Well, like my dad used to say...

20:49.410 --> 20:53.120
"You want to hide something
leave it where everybody can see it."

20:53.250 --> 20:54.540
My god, it's gorgeous.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.830
- Let me see.
- No. Don't know what it is yet.

20:56.960 --> 20:57.920
Could be dangerous.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.340
What? Wrong.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.630
I got to know what it is.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.800
Been looking
for that fucking thing for 30 years.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.510
- Billy, don't be such a dick.
- Poop.

21:05.630 --> 21:06.720
This isn't an invention.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.550
It's a responsibility.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.470
I need to study this.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.680
And if we find that it will help
mankind move peacefully forward...

21:14.810 --> 21:17.060
then we shall share its teachings...

21:17.190 --> 21:20.520
because we are not
only men of science.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.360
- We--
- Are men of hope.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.860
How did you know
what I was gonna say?

21:23.990 --> 21:26.360
What? Your dad said that
at the end of, like, every episode.

21:26.490 --> 21:28.320
Oh. Well, he was right.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.570
I mean, he was always right.

21:30.700 --> 21:34.080
My dad hid this for a reason,
and we have to respect that.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.870
The guy was a crappy father.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.670
But, Billy, I'll tell you, he--
he was a great scientist.

21:39.790 --> 21:40.960
No.

21:41.090 --> 21:43.800
Rusty, please. Come on.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.720
You got to hit this. Don't leave me hanging.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.760
Alright, just once.
And if this ever gets out...

21:47.880 --> 21:49.050
My lips are sealed.

21:49.180 --> 21:52.640
Go team Venture!

22:22.250 --> 22:23.840
Hey, pop.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.920
What was the treasure?

22:25.050 --> 22:26.420
What? Oh, it was nothing.

22:26.550 --> 22:28.380
Just a-a note from my father.

22:28.510 --> 22:29.550
Where's Brock?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.550
I want him to get right on
fixing up his room.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.640
It's a pigsty.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.930
I thought he was with you.

22:34.305 --> 22:40.487
