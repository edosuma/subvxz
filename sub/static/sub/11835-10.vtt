WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:07.672
How can this be happening?!

00:07.705 --> 00:09.674
Miguel, the victim's wife

00:09.708 --> 00:11.109
identifies you as the killer.

00:11.142 --> 00:12.511
The DA's gonna listen.

00:12.544 --> 00:14.346
And you being the fiancee,

00:14.379 --> 00:16.515
they'll tend not to believe
your alibi.

00:16.548 --> 00:18.717
We need to talk about
the plea deal.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.820
(speaking Spanish)

00:24.956 --> 00:26.958
Do you believe I'm innocent?

00:26.991 --> 00:29.528
It's not important
what we believe.

00:29.561 --> 00:30.895
It's important to me.

00:30.929 --> 00:35.767
Miguel? Yes, we know
they have the wrong man.

00:39.304 --> 00:43.007
The deal the DA offered--
it's 11 years, right?

00:43.041 --> 00:44.943
No, Miguel.
I'm just asking.

00:44.976 --> 00:47.379
No, I'm not letting you
go away 11 years

00:47.412 --> 00:49.013
for a crime you didn't do.

00:49.047 --> 00:53.217
Miguel...
I think we can win this.

00:53.251 --> 00:54.919
I really do.

00:56.020 --> 00:57.556
Are you still with me?

01:01.426 --> 01:02.427
Okay.

01:03.928 --> 01:05.597
What do you mean
you can't win?

01:05.630 --> 01:07.532
I didn't say I can't.

01:07.566 --> 01:09.167
I'm saying
it will be difficult--

01:09.200 --> 01:11.770
I saw him, Helen.
I was there.

01:11.803 --> 01:12.737
Understood.

01:12.771 --> 01:14.873
And the integrity
of your word aside,

01:14.906 --> 01:16.808
eyewitness testimony's
not a lock,

01:16.841 --> 01:20.211
especially when it stands alone,
which it does here.

01:20.244 --> 01:22.280
What are you suggesting?

01:22.314 --> 01:24.949
Well, they turned down 11.
I'd like to go back with eight.

01:24.983 --> 01:26.150
Eight years?

01:26.184 --> 01:27.419
For murder?

01:27.452 --> 01:29.020
It takes him
off the street.

01:29.053 --> 01:32.524
My husband's life was worth
more than eight years.

01:32.557 --> 01:35.627
Emily, it's not about measuring
your husband's life.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.229
It's about ensuring that the man
who shot him, in fact,

01:38.262 --> 01:39.297
goes to prison.

01:40.164 --> 01:42.734
I want him in prison
forever.

01:42.767 --> 01:45.169
(sighs)

01:45.203 --> 01:46.938
Okay.

01:46.971 --> 01:48.707
I said I'd let it be
your call.

01:49.841 --> 01:51.343
So we'll go to trial.

01:54.112 --> 01:57.115
(music playing)

02:47.065 --> 02:49.233
You promised me
you'd stop shoplifting.

02:49.267 --> 02:53.004
I didn't boost nothing!
I'm innocent this time!

02:53.037 --> 02:54.306
You're innocent?
Yes!

02:54.339 --> 02:55.774
You had the stereo
in your coat!

02:55.807 --> 02:57.609
That was a present
for my mom's birthday.

02:57.642 --> 02:59.110
(sighs)

02:59.143 --> 03:01.179
How can it be stealing
if it's for someone else?

03:01.212 --> 03:03.715
Okay, that's a defense
we're not putting on.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.183
Look, I gave it back.

03:05.216 --> 03:06.885
(sighs)

03:09.187 --> 03:10.889
So, what--
what am I looking at?

03:12.691 --> 03:14.092
They are charging you

03:14.125 --> 03:16.861
under the common and notorious
thief statute.

03:18.563 --> 03:19.698
Is that bad?

03:19.731 --> 03:21.533
It's very bad.

03:21.566 --> 03:23.902
It means the penalties
go way up.

03:23.935 --> 03:25.637
(sighs)

03:25.670 --> 03:27.271
Let me try
to plead you out.

03:27.306 --> 03:29.007
I have a good relationship
with the DA.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.243
Maybe I can get you
six months.

03:32.276 --> 03:33.845
Six months?

03:33.878 --> 03:38.717
Maynard, if we lose at trial,
the max is 20 years,

03:38.750 --> 03:40.785
and I don't know how
we can win!

03:44.489 --> 03:45.490
(sighs)

03:49.027 --> 03:50.061
All right.

03:50.094 --> 03:52.597
This is an hour before
the murder.

03:52.631 --> 03:55.133
The store's a block
from the crime scene.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.401
We were interested

03:56.435 --> 03:59.338
because the shooter was
described as a male Hispanic,

03:59.371 --> 04:01.540
early 20s, dark jacket.

04:01.573 --> 04:05.310
We used credit-card records
to track this man down.

04:05.344 --> 04:06.345
HELEN: Do you see him
in the room?

04:06.378 --> 04:08.947
Yes.
He's the defendant.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.149
Right there.
Miguel Havalera.

04:11.883 --> 04:13.017
Then what happened?

04:13.051 --> 04:14.453
We spoke with Mr. Havalera.

04:14.486 --> 04:17.856
He gave us an alibi,
but we were not convinced.

04:17.889 --> 04:21.459
So we had Mr. Havalera stand
in a lineup for Mrs. Coyne.

04:21.493 --> 04:23.762
HELEN: Based on what
Mrs. Coyne told you,

04:23.795 --> 04:25.464
what did you do next?

04:25.497 --> 04:28.533
We arrested Mr. Havalera
for the murder of Trevor Coyne.

04:30.034 --> 04:33.472
The lineup was a full
two months after the murder.

04:33.505 --> 04:34.706
That's correct.

04:34.739 --> 04:36.007
And before the lineup,

04:36.040 --> 04:38.977
you told Mrs. Coyne
you had a suspect--

04:39.010 --> 04:40.078
did you not, Detective?

04:40.111 --> 04:41.380
Yes.

04:41.413 --> 04:44.783
So, it's likely she had
an expectation

04:44.816 --> 04:46.618
that you had the right man
in custody.

04:46.651 --> 04:49.588
Objection. The witness
has no foundation
on the expectations--

04:49.621 --> 04:51.022
Sustained.

04:51.055 --> 04:53.892
Detective... are you
aware of the study

04:53.925 --> 04:56.194
showing how easily
witness recollections

04:56.227 --> 04:57.796
can be manipulated?

04:57.829 --> 05:00.432
I'm aware of studies
going both ways, counselor.

05:00.465 --> 05:03.302
Have you read the Cardozo
Law School study

05:03.335 --> 05:07.539
showing that 65
of 77 wrongful convictions

05:07.572 --> 05:09.341
overturned in the last decade

05:09.374 --> 05:12.043
resulted from eyewitness
mistakes?

05:12.076 --> 05:14.879
Objection. Mr. Berluti
is now giving testimony.

05:14.913 --> 05:17.248
Sustained.
Ask questions, counsel,

05:17.281 --> 05:18.917
don't provide answers.

05:18.950 --> 05:21.920
Detective, you have
no physical evidence

05:21.953 --> 05:24.155
connecting my client
to this crime.

05:24.188 --> 05:26.358
Isn't that right?
No fingerprints,

05:26.391 --> 05:28.660
murder weapon, DNA?

05:28.693 --> 05:30.429
That's correct.

05:31.496 --> 05:33.131
I don't think
he hurt us too bad.

05:33.164 --> 05:35.334
The key will be her,
the eyewitness.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.402
You ready?
As ready as I can be,
I guess.

05:37.436 --> 05:39.404
Mr. Berluti...
Ms. Dole.

05:39.438 --> 05:40.639
Yes?

05:40.672 --> 05:42.206
I was in the Courtroom
just then.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.143
It's a hobby of mine.
I'm a Court buff.

05:45.176 --> 05:47.078
I was curious--
do you think you'll win this?

05:48.613 --> 05:49.981
I'm sorry. You are...?

05:50.014 --> 05:51.950
Michael Crane.
I'm a Minister

05:51.983 --> 05:54.419
with the First Presbyterian
Church in Jamaica Plain.

05:54.453 --> 05:55.854
If I hadn't gone
into the clergy,

05:55.887 --> 05:58.022
I think I would have opted
for law school.

05:58.056 --> 05:59.858
I love monitoring big cases,

05:59.891 --> 06:02.494
and homicides are always
quite fascinating.

06:02.527 --> 06:04.363
I was just wondering

06:04.396 --> 06:06.130
whether you think you can get
an acquittal here.

06:06.164 --> 06:08.767
Well, I'm sorry, Reverend,

06:08.800 --> 06:11.102
but we don't really discuss
our cases with anybody.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.372
Of course.

06:13.405 --> 06:15.273
Well, good luck
to you both, anyway.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.741
Thank you.

06:19.844 --> 06:22.614
Come on, Ellenor.
Collared three times
in six months--

06:22.647 --> 06:23.748
my heart's not exactly
bleeding.

06:23.782 --> 06:25.249
Minor shoplifting beefs.

06:25.283 --> 06:27.118
We're getting pressured upstairs
to make some examples.

06:27.151 --> 06:29.220
Well, just don't make one
of Maynard Parrish.

06:29.253 --> 06:31.089
His biggest crime
is being stupid.

06:31.122 --> 06:32.123
He's a sweet kid!

06:32.156 --> 06:34.158
Yes, I know,
they're all sweet.

06:34.192 --> 06:35.760
Do I tell you they're sweet?

06:35.794 --> 06:38.062
(sighs)
Come on.

06:38.096 --> 06:40.399
Our relationship has
to count for something.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.535
Come by my office.

06:43.568 --> 06:44.903
I'll see if we can work
something.

06:44.936 --> 06:46.938
You see?
Now you're sweet.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.807
And that I will stand by.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.009
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:52.110 --> 06:55.780
We finished dinner
around 9:30.

06:55.814 --> 06:58.617
We were walking to our car...

06:58.650 --> 07:01.486
when a man ran across
the street.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.587
Right towards us.

07:03.688 --> 07:05.690
I noticed he had a gun.

07:05.724 --> 07:09.193
He asked for
our wallets, jewelry.

07:09.227 --> 07:11.330
What happened next,
Mrs. Coyne?

07:11.363 --> 07:13.532
Trevor took a step
in front of me.

07:15.667 --> 07:18.002
Probably didn't even
realize he'd done it.

07:19.203 --> 07:20.605
Then what happened?

07:20.639 --> 07:22.474
(voice breaking)
I heard a shot.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.312
And I saw fire shoot out
of the gun.

07:28.947 --> 07:30.715
And I was covered with blood.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.455
And I heard Trevor scream.

07:36.488 --> 07:38.457
What did your attacker do?

07:38.490 --> 07:43.762
He stood there,
like he was frozen
for a few seconds.

07:43.795 --> 07:46.197
(sniffs)
And then he ran off.

07:46.230 --> 07:49.200
Mrs. Coyne, did you get
a good look at his face?

07:49.233 --> 07:50.802
Yes.

07:50.835 --> 07:53.305
He was only
about ten feet away.

07:53.338 --> 07:55.807
Do you see
in the courtroom today

07:55.840 --> 07:57.809
the man who shot your husband?

07:57.842 --> 07:59.311
That's him.

08:00.078 --> 08:01.212
The defendant.

08:01.245 --> 08:03.114
Are you positive?

08:03.147 --> 08:04.583
Yes.

08:04.616 --> 08:06.217
That's the man.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.786
Thank you.

08:16.561 --> 08:17.696
It was dark?

08:17.729 --> 08:19.263
There were street lamps.

08:19.297 --> 08:21.866
How far away was the nearest
street lamp, do you know?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.702
Thirty feet or so.

08:23.735 --> 08:25.337
The police say 50 feet.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.506
There was enough light
for me to see, Ms. Dole.

08:27.539 --> 08:30.809
You saw, for example,
the type of gun your
assailant was carrying?

08:30.842 --> 08:32.176
Very clearly.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.946
A small pistol, silver,

08:34.979 --> 08:36.246
with a black handle.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.749
Do you remember what
he was wearing?

08:37.782 --> 08:40.519
A dark jacket and jeans.

08:40.552 --> 08:42.921
How long did it take
from the time you first saw
your assailant

08:42.953 --> 08:45.189
to the time he ran?
Probably...

08:45.223 --> 08:47.225
ten, 15 seconds.

08:47.258 --> 08:49.060
You said you had blood on you,
as well?

08:49.093 --> 08:50.362
Yes.

08:50.395 --> 08:51.596
Were you scared?

08:51.630 --> 08:52.831
It was that man.

08:52.864 --> 08:54.265
Are you sure?

08:54.298 --> 08:56.067
I don't need
to think about it.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.235
That's him.

08:57.268 --> 08:59.304
Mrs. Coyne, I'm confused,

08:59.338 --> 09:01.272
because in the police lineup,

09:01.306 --> 09:03.808
you did need time
to think about it.

09:03.842 --> 09:07.078
You studied those men
for almost a minute.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.013
Are you saying your
recollection is sharper now

09:09.047 --> 09:10.515
than it was six months ago?

09:10.549 --> 09:14.486
I took the extra time
because I wanted to be positive.

09:14.519 --> 09:16.488
Mrs. Coyne, I want to lay out
a scenario for you,

09:16.521 --> 09:18.390
and you tell me
if it's possible, okay?

09:18.423 --> 09:19.658
Fine.

09:19.691 --> 09:21.460
You were brought
to a police lineup,

09:21.493 --> 09:25.464
having been told the police had
the man who shot your husband.

09:25.497 --> 09:26.631
So when they brought
the men out,

09:26.665 --> 09:30.234
you felt one of those men
was the guy.

09:30.268 --> 09:32.404
You settled on my client
after a minute

09:32.437 --> 09:34.973
because he looks the most
like the guy.

09:35.006 --> 09:36.575
Today, you identify
him quickly.

09:36.608 --> 09:38.743
Not necessarily because
he's the man you saw

09:38.777 --> 09:40.979
on the street with the gun,
but because he's the man

09:41.012 --> 09:44.148
you saw that day
in the police lineup.

09:44.182 --> 09:45.817
Possible?
No.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.486
Not even possible?

09:47.519 --> 09:49.153
No.

09:49.187 --> 09:51.456
He's the man
who shot my husband.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.192
Were you told to be
unequivocal up here?

09:54.225 --> 09:55.594
No.

09:57.462 --> 10:00.164
Did you tell the police
the shooter had a goatee?

10:00.198 --> 10:02.901
No. I didn't remember that part.

10:02.934 --> 10:05.003
You didn't remember?

10:05.036 --> 10:06.671
You could describe the gun,
the clothes,

10:06.705 --> 10:09.140
but you couldn't remember
if the shooter had facial hair?

10:09.173 --> 10:13.211
Look...
he shot my husband!

10:13.244 --> 10:15.447
You make room for no
possibility whatsoever

10:15.480 --> 10:17.616
that you could be wrong.

10:17.649 --> 10:19.318
Is that your testimony,
Mrs. Coyne?

10:19.351 --> 10:20.452
Yes.

10:22.987 --> 10:24.456
Thank you.

10:24.489 --> 10:26.157
You certainly weren't
equivocal here.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.072
Mitchell, we've been friends
a long time.

10:41.105 --> 10:43.508
I'm the first one to admit that
most of my clients are scum.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.377
I even complain about it.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.479
The kid needs a break.

10:47.512 --> 10:48.947
And what do I tell
my superiors?

10:50.715 --> 10:52.817
That you did the right thing.

10:52.851 --> 10:54.353
Look, if he gets
caught again,

10:54.386 --> 10:56.688
I promise you,
I will not fight you on it.

10:56.721 --> 10:59.458
But this time, please.

10:59.491 --> 11:00.992
Ellenor...

11:01.025 --> 11:04.429
he is saying he didn't realize
the stereo was under his jacket.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.797
I mean, he's a liar!

11:05.830 --> 11:07.399
He was boosting it
for his mother.

11:07.432 --> 11:09.501
He wanted to get her a present!

11:09.534 --> 11:10.268
Mitchell, come on!

11:10.302 --> 11:11.836
I'm going to
the favor bank here.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.538
I will give you anything.

11:14.706 --> 11:15.874
Anything?

11:16.941 --> 11:18.009
Well, why do you say it
like that?

11:18.042 --> 11:19.177
What do you want?

11:20.945 --> 11:23.415
Take off your shirt.

11:23.448 --> 11:24.516
Very funny.

11:24.549 --> 11:27.519
(chuckling) Come on.

11:27.552 --> 11:29.287
I can't help you.
I wish I could.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.360
Were you serious
just then...

11:35.394 --> 11:37.396
when you asked me
to take off my shirt?

11:39.598 --> 11:42.166
Mitchell, were you?

11:42.200 --> 11:44.569
Ellenor...

11:44.603 --> 11:45.837
...we go way back.

11:47.105 --> 11:48.673
But you don't know
everything about me.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.076
Such as?

11:52.110 --> 11:53.845
I'm attracted to you.

11:57.649 --> 11:58.750
You're married.

11:58.783 --> 12:00.084
I know. I--

12:00.118 --> 12:01.986
I would never cheat on Margie.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.288
I mean, not with an affair.

12:05.223 --> 12:06.625
My heart belongs to her.

12:07.792 --> 12:08.993
But, uh...

12:10.795 --> 12:11.996
fun, little...

12:13.898 --> 12:14.999
...excursions.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.602
Excursions?

12:19.638 --> 12:22.474
I can't really give
your Parrish kid a break.

12:22.507 --> 12:27.312
But if something between you
and me were to happen, well...

12:30.349 --> 12:33.918
to avoid the appearance
of impropriety...

12:33.952 --> 12:35.587
I'd try to be especially...

12:37.422 --> 12:38.890
...fair.

12:41.259 --> 12:43.962
So if I have sex with you,
you'll cut a deal?

12:43.995 --> 12:48.232
(chuckling) I'm shocked that
you would get that impression,

12:48.266 --> 12:50.735
however accurate it might be.

12:59.143 --> 13:02.180
He offered it like that?
Quid pro quo?

13:02.213 --> 13:04.716
Well, he said he would be
especially fair.

13:04.749 --> 13:07.151
If you had sex?
Yes.

13:07.185 --> 13:08.219
How was it?

13:08.252 --> 13:09.888
(phone rings)

13:09.921 --> 13:12.156
What--
what should I do?

13:12.190 --> 13:14.326
Ellenor...
you can't take that deal.

13:14.359 --> 13:16.961
Thank you.
Besides that sterling tip...

13:16.995 --> 13:19.398
I had a case with him once.
He didn't ask me for sex.

13:19.431 --> 13:20.632
So how did you leave it?

13:20.665 --> 13:24.268
I was so stunned,
I just-- I walked out.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.471
Well, I would first
make sure he knows

13:26.505 --> 13:27.706
you didn't accept the offer.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.143
Lucy...call him.

13:32.176 --> 13:33.512
Don't have to.

13:33.545 --> 13:35.380
That was him.
He's on his way over.

13:41.853 --> 13:44.889
Me and Miguel rented
this video-- Big.

13:44.923 --> 13:47.492
We took the bus back
to my house.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.594
We started watching it
at 9:00.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.162
What time did it end?

13:51.195 --> 13:52.731
Around 11:00 or so.

13:52.764 --> 13:56.901
Christina, did Miguel leave
your side at any point

13:56.935 --> 13:59.103
during the evening of may 14th?

13:59.137 --> 14:02.641
No. He was with me
the whole time.

14:02.674 --> 14:04.075
I swear.

14:04.108 --> 14:06.678
And you're absolutely positive
about that?

14:06.711 --> 14:08.212
Yes.

14:08.246 --> 14:10.382
You're engaged to be married
to the defendant?

14:10.415 --> 14:11.383
That's right.

14:11.416 --> 14:13.017
And you love him very much?

14:13.051 --> 14:14.353
Yes.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.421
Would you lie
to give him an alibi?

14:16.455 --> 14:17.856
No.

14:17.889 --> 14:20.124
Did you call your cousin
Martina Bell

14:20.158 --> 14:21.960
on the evening of May 14th

14:21.993 --> 14:23.495
and ask her to join you
for dinner?

14:23.528 --> 14:24.996
Yes.

14:25.029 --> 14:26.365
And did you tell her

14:26.398 --> 14:29.167
that your fiancee would be
out for the evening?

14:29.200 --> 14:33.237
I thought he was, but then
he came home unexpected.

14:33.271 --> 14:36.007
He came home unexpected.

14:36.808 --> 14:39.143
Did anyone else besides you

14:39.177 --> 14:41.279
see him at your
apartment that evening

14:41.313 --> 14:43.582
between the hours
of 8:00 and 11:00?

14:43.615 --> 14:45.550
I don't know.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.886
When the police showed up at
your apartment that evening,

14:47.919 --> 14:50.589
your fiance hid in the closet,
didn't he?

14:50.622 --> 14:51.790
Well...

14:53.392 --> 14:56.495
He thought it was other people
banging on the door.

14:56.528 --> 14:59.598
And... I just thought
it would look bad

14:59.631 --> 15:02.734
if I told the police
that he was in the closet,

15:02.767 --> 15:05.003
and so I just said
no one else was home.

15:05.036 --> 15:05.904
You lied.

15:05.937 --> 15:07.472
Yes.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.774
You lied to help your fiance.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.110
I shouldn't have, but I did.

15:12.143 --> 15:13.778
But you're not lying today?

15:13.812 --> 15:15.480
That's right.

15:20.452 --> 15:21.820
I think we're gonna have to
call you.

15:21.853 --> 15:23.988
I thought you said
it was dangerous.

15:24.022 --> 15:27.291
It is...very. But...

15:28.327 --> 15:32.296
Christina, you didn't come off
so credible just then.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.766
And we have to account for why
you jumped in the closet.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.668
I was hiding from dealers.

15:36.701 --> 15:38.470
I understand.

15:38.503 --> 15:40.539
But to the jury right now,

15:40.572 --> 15:42.006
it just looks like
you were hiding.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.976
We need to call you.

15:58.289 --> 16:01.192
I'm suddenly thinking...
we should take the 11 years.

16:01.225 --> 16:03.328
It's still one
eyewitness, Jimmy.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.497
An eyewitness that held tough,

16:05.530 --> 16:07.966
and when the jury hears
about Miguel's prior--

16:07.999 --> 16:10.268
You think it's
too risky calling him?

16:13.938 --> 16:16.908
Does he strike you
as a Court buff?

16:16.941 --> 16:17.976
No.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.719
Reverend...
still enjoying the trial?

16:27.752 --> 16:28.953
Yes.

16:28.987 --> 16:31.656
What's your objective opinion?
How are we doing?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.224
Not so well, really.

16:33.257 --> 16:35.794
The fiancee seemed like
she was protecting him.

16:35.827 --> 16:38.229
You might be right.

16:38.262 --> 16:40.298
Could I ask you
one more thing?
Sure.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.134
Why do I get the feeling you're
not a disinterested bystander?

16:43.167 --> 16:45.036
I'm not disinterested.
I told you.

16:45.069 --> 16:47.539
You're a buff.
(chuckles)

16:47.572 --> 16:50.108
What do you know, Reverend?

16:50.141 --> 16:53.177
You look a little anxious
in that room.

16:53.211 --> 16:54.513
Like you have a stake.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.881
What do you know?
Nothing.

16:58.383 --> 16:59.851
I'll tell you this--

16:59.884 --> 17:01.886
if our case goes
any further south,

17:01.920 --> 17:03.922
we might just subpoena you...
on a whim.

17:03.955 --> 17:05.390
That would be ridiculous.

17:05.424 --> 17:06.925
Somehow I don't think so.

17:06.958 --> 17:08.560
You're here because you know
something.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.063
I think you need
to talk to us, Reverend.

17:12.096 --> 17:14.465
Thank you, but you're wrong,
and I need to get back.

17:16.401 --> 17:18.403
Please let go of me,
Mr. Berluti.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.740
The process server
will be at your Church

17:21.772 --> 17:23.508
waiting with the summons.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.175
Talk to us.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.650
Suppose what I know
doesn't help you.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.219
At this point, we're willing
to take that risk.

17:35.253 --> 17:36.254
Not here.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.524
Let's go to a witness room.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.060
No. Not anywhere here.

17:46.631 --> 17:48.132
Go buy us some time.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.745
(door closes)

18:03.948 --> 18:07.686
I am extremely sorry for my
inappropriate behavior.

18:07.719 --> 18:08.787
I'm going through some...

18:08.820 --> 18:11.323
personal problems at home,
Ellenor, and...

18:12.857 --> 18:14.058
well, I apologize.

18:16.127 --> 18:17.762
Okay.

18:17.796 --> 18:22.767
Obviously, any deal
predicated on a sexual
relationship is wrong,

18:22.801 --> 18:24.135
and hereby off the table.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.472
I'm very upset that
I even threw it out there.

18:29.874 --> 18:31.810
Well, let's start
again, then.

18:33.111 --> 18:36.180
As I said,
Maynard Parrish is not
a career criminal.

18:36.214 --> 18:37.716
I wish I could help you.

18:37.749 --> 18:40.652
But as I said, we've got our
marching orders on this statute.

18:40.685 --> 18:42.354
Which means what,
you're gonna push for the 20?

18:42.387 --> 18:45.023
I could sell ten upstairs,
but nothing less.

18:45.056 --> 18:47.158
Ten is ridiculous,
and you know it!

18:48.126 --> 18:49.561
I don't know what else
to tell you.

18:53.598 --> 18:56.067
You know, Mitchell, I'm
getting the sickening feeling

18:56.100 --> 18:59.070
that your offer wasn't pulled
because of conscience,

18:59.103 --> 19:00.705
but because
I wouldn't go for it.

19:00.739 --> 19:04.443
Well... you would
be wrong there.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.244
Really?

19:06.277 --> 19:07.546
I want the six months.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.280
We never had a deal.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.249
I want the six months.

19:11.883 --> 19:13.752
I'm sorry.

19:13.785 --> 19:16.187
I think any favorable deal

19:16.220 --> 19:17.989
would be met with suspicion
at this point,

19:18.022 --> 19:19.691
and I'm just gonna
play this straight.

19:19.724 --> 19:22.361
Straight?
Or punitive?

19:22.394 --> 19:24.929
Ten years is it, Ellenor.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.065
And suppose...

19:29.468 --> 19:31.570
sex was not off the table.

19:33.738 --> 19:35.740
I'll say it again.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.377
Ten years is it.

19:47.018 --> 19:49.053
First...

19:49.087 --> 19:51.323
what I say
has to be privileged.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.191
We can't promise that.

19:53.224 --> 19:54.926
Then you get nothing.

19:54.959 --> 19:58.363
I think conscience brought you
down to that Courthouse.

19:58.397 --> 20:01.633
I think conscience
is the reason you're here now.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.235
I want this discussion
to be privileged.

20:06.971 --> 20:08.407
That's the only way
it'll be.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.241
Okay.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.378
And now,
speaking to my attorneys...

20:14.846 --> 20:15.914
my problem is...

20:18.317 --> 20:20.352
...one of my congregants
killed Mr. Coyne.

20:22.787 --> 20:24.789
He came to me
under the seal

20:24.823 --> 20:27.692
of a conversation
with his Minister...

20:27.726 --> 20:29.728
...and admitted his crime.

20:31.229 --> 20:33.097
And his guilt was compounded

20:33.131 --> 20:35.767
by the idea
of an innocent man

20:35.800 --> 20:37.602
being wrongly convicted.

20:39.270 --> 20:41.706
I've been monitoring the trial
on his behalf.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.908
(sighs)

20:43.942 --> 20:47.145
He told me if it appears your
client faces conviction...

20:49.481 --> 20:51.483
...he might be willing
to come forward.

20:54.118 --> 20:57.288
That's all I'm
at liberty to say.

20:57.322 --> 21:00.191
Please, convey
to your congregant...

21:01.526 --> 21:05.330
Miguel Havalera is facing
a conviction.

21:16.174 --> 21:17.809
You have to go
to the Judge.

21:17.842 --> 21:19.944
And say what?
He pulled the offer.

21:19.978 --> 21:23.315
But, Ellenor, your suspicion is
he's now taking a harder line.

21:23.348 --> 21:26.050
He is, but I don't know
whether he's being punitive,

21:26.084 --> 21:28.119
or if he's simply determined
to be ethical

21:28.152 --> 21:29.220
because he's so embarrassed.

21:29.253 --> 21:30.922
Either way
the client suffers.

21:30.955 --> 21:32.891
The guy comes on to you,
you rebuff the advance,

21:32.924 --> 21:36.160
and as a result the client's
getting a lesser deal.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.729
You have to report that.

21:37.762 --> 21:39.263
Mitchell Wheeler
is my friend.

21:39.297 --> 21:41.400
We have known each other
for years.

21:41.433 --> 21:44.603
Friends don't put friends
in that position.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.204
I'm also friends
with his wife.

21:46.237 --> 21:49.273
If this gets out, Bobby,
people are going to be hurt.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.476
Ellenor, as an officer
of the Court,

21:51.510 --> 21:54.245
you have an ethical obligation
to report him.

21:54.278 --> 21:56.648
Please, Eugene, don't
"officer of the Court"
me on this.

21:56.681 --> 22:00.919
You have knowledge of a DA
putting sex on the table
in plea bargains.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.153
If he did it here,

22:02.186 --> 22:05.890
the likelihood is he's done it
before, and he will do it again.

22:05.924 --> 22:08.693
I doubt it.
But even if you're right,

22:08.727 --> 22:11.396
let somebody else report him.
I'm his friend.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.666
Ellenor, if the client is
getting hurt,

22:14.699 --> 22:16.601
you can't sit on it.

22:24.108 --> 22:25.577
(sighs)

22:25.610 --> 22:27.078
He's not coming forward.

22:27.111 --> 22:29.614
But you said--
I thought he would.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.250
He said he would,
but he changed his mind.

22:32.283 --> 22:33.818
He doesn't want to go
to prison.

22:38.222 --> 22:42.894
Reverend, assuming we can
clear hearsay problems,

22:42.927 --> 22:43.962
would you be willing
to testify--

22:43.995 --> 22:45.697
Absolutely not.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.199
We need you now.
Our kid's going down.

22:48.232 --> 22:51.970
What he told me was the
equivalent of a confession,
Mr. Berluti.

22:52.003 --> 22:53.705
Even so,
the consequences--

22:53.738 --> 22:54.873
I won't do it.

22:58.142 --> 22:59.344
In that case...

23:00.412 --> 23:01.480
For you.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.983
What?
It's a subpoena.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.551
I'm really sorry, but--

23:06.585 --> 23:07.886
Mr. Berluti...

23:08.753 --> 23:09.921
Ms. Dole...

23:11.323 --> 23:13.224
If I were to betray
this confidence...

23:15.527 --> 23:16.761
I'd lose my job...

23:18.062 --> 23:19.331
...my Church.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.302
I must plead with you now.

23:23.335 --> 23:27.439
I don't feel good
about what we're doing
here, Reverend, but--

23:27.472 --> 23:31.142
I tried to help you.
If you make me testify--

23:31.175 --> 23:32.711
You have information

23:32.744 --> 23:35.213
that could exonerate
my client of murder.

23:36.247 --> 23:38.883
We have no choice here
but to call you.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.123
Ten years?!

23:45.156 --> 23:46.558
I'm working on it.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.026
Working on it?!
You said, "six months"!

23:48.059 --> 23:49.293
Maynard--
What's going on?!

23:49.328 --> 23:52.397
Don't panic.
Don't--
No, you don't panic!

23:52.431 --> 23:54.098
I'm the one
that's facing prison!

23:54.132 --> 23:55.900
I'm on it, Maynard.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.404
(voice shaking)
Ellenor...

23:59.438 --> 24:02.341
(breathing heavily)

24:02.374 --> 24:04.376
What the hell's going on?

24:05.644 --> 24:07.245
Just let me work on it.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.456
Even if you could
force him to testify,

24:17.489 --> 24:19.023
it would all be hearsay.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.592
Your Honor could
force him to reveal

24:20.625 --> 24:22.927
the identity of the shooter.
That's not hearsay.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.496
HELEN: But if he's
claiming privilege--

24:24.529 --> 24:26.297
I don't think
it is privileged.

24:26.331 --> 24:29.334
He's not a Catholic priest.
This wasn't a confession.

24:29.368 --> 24:32.771
We treat all communications
with clergy pretty much
the same, counsel.

24:32.804 --> 24:36.174
If it's for spiritual guidance.
I don't think this qualifies.

24:36.207 --> 24:39.478
Look, nobody here wants the
wrong man convicted of murder.

24:39.511 --> 24:42.046
Let's question him outside
the presence of the jury

24:42.080 --> 24:43.548
and see what turns up.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.116
Nobody can have a problem
with that.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.358
Are you trying
to extort me, Ellenor?

24:53.392 --> 24:55.994
I'm telling you
that I have an obligation

24:56.027 --> 24:57.329
to reveal what happened.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.597
Nothing happened.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.298
Mitchell, you put
something in play.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.666
You know you did.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.167
I revoked it before
it was in play.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.269
I'm offended by your attempt
at blackmail,

25:05.304 --> 25:07.005
and I will not make deals
under the duress--

25:07.038 --> 25:09.441
I have to defend my client.

25:09.474 --> 25:11.175
Not that way you don't.

25:11.209 --> 25:14.913
All rise.
This Court is now in session.

25:14.946 --> 25:17.382
The honorable Judge Kittleson
presiding.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.852
Any business before
we bring in the jury?

25:20.885 --> 25:23.388
No, Your Honor, the Commonwealth
is ready for trial.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.889
Ms. Frutt?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.059
Is defense ready,
Ms. Frutt?

25:38.803 --> 25:41.440
Your Honor, regretfully I have
to report some misconduct

25:41.473 --> 25:43.007
committed by Mr. Wheeler,

25:43.041 --> 25:46.378
which misconduct has affected
the disposition of this case.

25:46.411 --> 25:47.979
What misconduct?

25:49.614 --> 25:52.351
The district attorney sexually
propositioned me last night,

25:52.384 --> 25:55.387
suggesting a sentence of
six months for my client.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.756
That proposition was rejected,

25:57.789 --> 25:59.891
and with sex being removed
from the equation,

25:59.924 --> 26:03.462
Mr. Wheeler's offer
went up to ten years.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.666
Mr. Wheeler, do you have
a response?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.704
I don't know what to say,
Your Honor.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.005
I'm stunned.

26:14.038 --> 26:15.340
Was sex put on the table

26:15.374 --> 26:16.975
as part of a plea bargain?

26:17.008 --> 26:20.278
Yes, it was
put on the table.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.446
By Ms. Frutt.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.916
Excuse me?

26:24.949 --> 26:26.385
And I immediately
rejected it.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.986
You've got to be kidding!

26:28.019 --> 26:30.288
Why don't we take this
to chambers.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.632
He's lying.
Oh, I'm lying.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.401
Yes, you are, Mitchell.
And you should be disgusted--

26:42.434 --> 26:43.802
All right, that's enough.

26:43.835 --> 26:45.269
Ellenor.
He's lying!

26:45.304 --> 26:47.038
You can expect to be sued
for defamation.

26:47.071 --> 26:48.440
And I'll tell you that,
because immunity--

26:48.473 --> 26:49.908
Go ahead and sue me,
Mitchell!

26:49.941 --> 26:51.610
I said, "all right."

26:53.445 --> 26:55.680
I am not about
to get into this.

26:55.714 --> 26:56.815
You should get into it.

26:56.848 --> 26:58.350
This is one stunt too many
for this firm.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.919
Mr. Wheeler, I'll ask you
for the last time to be quiet.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.257
I don't care who made the
advance.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.694
You're now officially
off this case.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.262
Another DA Will be assigned,

27:11.295 --> 27:14.265
and I'm advising both of you

27:14.298 --> 27:16.167
to let this die now.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.602
I am not going
to let this die!

27:17.636 --> 27:19.738
Mr. Wheeler, you're excused.
Beat it.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.640
If she's gonna tell
more untruths--

27:21.673 --> 27:23.875
She's not.
The matter is dead.

27:23.908 --> 27:25.344
Get out now.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.218
I am telling the truth.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.655
Ellenor, I'm inclined
to believe you.

27:38.089 --> 27:42.794
But trust me when I advise you--
let this drop.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.162
How can I when--

27:44.195 --> 27:47.999
Because his reputation
is far superior to yours.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.403
Truth be told, there's
been a little gossip

27:51.436 --> 27:55.206
in these halls
about your romantic desperation.

27:57.108 --> 27:58.510
I beg your pardon?

27:58.543 --> 28:01.380
You dated a serial killer
who liked to dress up as a nun.

28:03.014 --> 28:06.217
You don't think the clerks
and DAs had some fun with that?

28:07.185 --> 28:08.587
And a few Judges?

28:08.620 --> 28:12.023
Your firm is also infamous
for stunting.

28:12.056 --> 28:15.259
Here you've got a client
dead to rights facing ten years.

28:15.293 --> 28:16.561
And you think
that I would resort

28:16.595 --> 28:18.563
to making up
this kind of story?!

28:18.597 --> 28:20.264
No, I don't.

28:20.298 --> 28:23.001
But, frankly,
Mitchell Wheeler's credibility

28:23.034 --> 28:24.669
is stronger than yours.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.939
And any game of "he said,
she said" will favor him.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.677
He's also
a good-looking man.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.514
Meaning?

28:37.616 --> 28:39.150
Meaning let it drop.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.421
Don't do any more
cases with him.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.964
(door opens, closes)

28:56.267 --> 29:00.505
Reverend, you're a material
witness in a homicide.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.641
I'm ordering you to testify.

29:02.674 --> 29:05.444
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I cannot.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.547
What was told to me was told
in strict confidence.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.249
I have duties imposed on me
that come from higher places

29:11.282 --> 29:12.216
than your bench.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.487
The Lord can't throw you
in a jail cell. I can.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.021
Well, then you'll have to.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.791
Leaving aside identity,

29:19.824 --> 29:21.726
did a man come to you

29:21.760 --> 29:23.495
and confess to killing
Trevor Coyne--

29:23.528 --> 29:25.296
a man other than
Miguel Havalera?

29:25.330 --> 29:26.465
I'm not talking,
Ms. Dole.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.933
Reverend--
What about my privilege?

29:28.967 --> 29:30.402
I'm sitting in this chair
right now

29:30.435 --> 29:32.170
because those lawyers revealed
my privilege.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.474
Reverend, obviously
you've agonized over

29:35.507 --> 29:37.642
what the right thing
is to do here.

29:37.676 --> 29:39.744
Otherwise...

29:39.778 --> 29:41.613
Without telling me who...

29:43.582 --> 29:45.917
...did a man other
than Miguel Havalera

29:45.950 --> 29:48.086
confess to killing
Trevor Coyne?

29:50.889 --> 29:52.023
Please.

29:52.924 --> 29:54.526
You can reveal that.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.168
Yes, I received
such a confession.

30:07.539 --> 30:08.973
Did he give any details--

30:09.007 --> 30:10.709
I am not saying
anything else.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.044
I'll go to my jail cell now.
That's all that I'm saying.

30:15.847 --> 30:17.449
Okay, Reverend,
you can step down.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.131
I'd like to put him on the stand
to say what he said here.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.699
I can't let you, counsel.

30:34.733 --> 30:37.669
Your Honor--
First of all, it's hearsay.

30:37.702 --> 30:40.104
We have no way of knowing
if it's reliable.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.541
Plenty of nuts confess
to crimes.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.208
It was his congregant.

30:44.242 --> 30:45.877
Obviously, he
considered it reliable--

30:45.910 --> 30:48.313
That's not good enough
for us.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.449
Second, there's totem pole
privilege here--

30:50.482 --> 30:52.617
the congregants,
also the Ministers--

30:52.651 --> 30:55.754
the truth is you had no right
to reveal what he told you.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.756
He hired you as his attorney.

30:57.789 --> 31:00.659
Only as a pretext to shield
what he had to say.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.295
I can't allow him to take the
stand, counsel, and you know it.

31:05.163 --> 31:07.298
Your Honor, somebody else

31:07.332 --> 31:08.800
confesses to the crime,

31:08.833 --> 31:10.502
and the jury doesn't get
to know about it?

31:10.535 --> 31:12.471
That's right, Mr. Berluti.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.272
And if you pull anything
like you did

31:14.306 --> 31:16.240
with the boy with the aneurysm,

31:16.274 --> 31:18.276
your bar card will be gone.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.244
That's a promise from me to you.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.248
The jury will hear nothing
of this Minister

31:24.282 --> 31:25.617
or any confession.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.228
You know I'm telling
the truth.

31:37.261 --> 31:38.930
I would never make
something like this up.

31:38.963 --> 31:42.767
Of course, I know it,
but it doesn't sound like
Mitchell Wheeler either.

31:42.801 --> 31:43.768
That's all I'm saying.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.670
You actually have doubts?
I believe you.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.439
Well, clearly
you're not sure.

31:47.472 --> 31:50.074
Ellenor, I believe you.
Now, listen--

31:50.108 --> 31:51.843
I'll get hold of the case.

31:51.876 --> 31:55.414
I can't promise you six months,
but I'll take care of you, okay?

31:56.280 --> 31:57.248
Okay.

31:57.281 --> 31:59.250
I won't even demand
a sexual favor.

31:59.283 --> 32:00.419
I'm not laughing.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.686
I'm sorry.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.888
Be patient.
I'll make it right.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.524
I got to get in Court.

32:12.997 --> 32:14.466
You know, Mitchell...

32:15.500 --> 32:17.836
The first thing you did
was unethical.

32:17.869 --> 32:20.004
But accusing me,
that was despicable.

32:20.038 --> 32:23.308
Ellenor...
you need to get help.

32:28.813 --> 32:33.151
I hid in the closet
because I didn't know
it was the police.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.454
You thought they were--

32:35.487 --> 32:36.821
Drug dealers.

32:36.855 --> 32:38.657
I owe some money.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.125
I use from time to time.
I admit that.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.594
Mr. Havalera...

32:43.962 --> 32:45.364
the night of the murder--

32:45.397 --> 32:49.501
I was home the whole night.
We rented a movie.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.236
We watched it.
I was home.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.005
Do you own a gun, sir?

32:54.038 --> 32:58.009
No, I have never owned a gun,
I've never fired one,

32:58.042 --> 33:00.445
and I did not shoot
Trevor Coyne.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.214
I swear this.
It was somebody else.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.018
You don't just use
from time to time.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.520
You have a drug problem.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.655
It's under control now.

33:12.557 --> 33:13.892
But you use.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.093
Very rarely.

33:16.127 --> 33:17.529
You robbed a liquor store once.

33:17.562 --> 33:18.663
Isn't that right?

33:18.697 --> 33:21.933
Six years ago
and not with a gun.

33:21.966 --> 33:24.469
You lost your job three weeks
prior to the shooting.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.639
Isn't that correct?
Yes.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.673
Mr. Havalera...

33:30.775 --> 33:32.944
other than your fiancee,

33:32.977 --> 33:34.779
do you have any alibi witness

33:34.813 --> 33:36.247
who can account
for your whereabouts

33:36.280 --> 33:37.382
the night of the shooting?

33:38.550 --> 33:39.718
No.

33:42.253 --> 33:45.056
The Minister has no reason
to make it up, Emily.

33:45.089 --> 33:47.225
I don't know
who the congregant is.

33:47.258 --> 33:48.527
Are you doubting now me?

33:49.994 --> 33:52.263
I'm asking you.

33:52.296 --> 33:53.532
Are you sure?

33:55.033 --> 33:58.437
The truth is eyewitness
testimony is manipulated.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.804
It happens all the time.

33:59.838 --> 34:03.808
Witnesses become convinced
of suspects they see in lineups.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.444
Trauma can affect memory.

34:05.477 --> 34:09.213
I remember his face, Helen.
Why else--

34:09.246 --> 34:11.081
Because you saw it
in a lineup.

34:11.114 --> 34:12.551
No.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.518
He's it.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.987
He's the man.

34:17.021 --> 34:18.056
I know it.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.393
LINDSAY: He's not the one.

34:21.426 --> 34:24.228
Does Emily Coyne think
she saw my client that night?

34:24.262 --> 34:25.764
She probably does.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.600
But she missed on facial hair,
didn't she?

34:28.632 --> 34:31.402
She described the gun,
the clothes,

34:31.436 --> 34:34.438
but she missed an obvious
facial description.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.908
And this gun, the clothes,

34:36.940 --> 34:39.511
never found in the possession
of my client.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.880
The prosecution offers
no witnesses

34:41.913 --> 34:44.449
who ever saw him wear
the clothes described.

34:44.483 --> 34:48.920
No physical evidence,
no forensics,

34:48.953 --> 34:52.424
nothing to link my client
with this crime.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.826
Just the testimony
of the victim's wife,

34:54.859 --> 34:56.728
who had to be scared,

34:56.761 --> 34:58.196
traumatized.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.532
It was a dark night.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.602
She's mistaken.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.705
Somebody else killed
Trevor Coyne.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.440
Maybe he looked like my client.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.444
But she is mistaken.

35:12.477 --> 35:16.348
She doesn't think it was him.

35:16.381 --> 35:17.616
She knows it.

35:17.649 --> 35:18.950
She was there.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.787
And she saw him--

35:22.821 --> 35:25.324
the man with the drug history,

35:25.357 --> 35:28.259
the man who robbed
a liquor store,

35:28.292 --> 35:33.064
the man who just lost his job
and needed money,

35:33.097 --> 35:36.167
the man the police found
hiding in the closet

35:36.200 --> 35:37.569
the night of the murder.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.804
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:41.440 --> 35:43.675
...we have an eyewitness

35:43.708 --> 35:46.277
who actually saw him commit
the murder.

35:48.547 --> 35:51.483
What else could
you possibly need?

35:57.889 --> 35:59.824
So, it's all gonna work out.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.026
I think so. Helen got
custody of the case,

36:02.060 --> 36:03.261
so she's gonna
take care of it.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.397
So that's great.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.765
Yep.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.768
But you don't seem happy.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.574
Well, I lost a friend
this week.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.442
I can't really
celebrate that, can I?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.379
Is that all there is?

36:24.549 --> 36:27.018
I don't like not being
believed, Rebecca.

36:27.051 --> 36:29.921
I-I thought
Judge Kittleson said

36:29.954 --> 36:31.990
she was inclined
to believe you.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.458
Yes, she was inclined,

36:33.492 --> 36:35.026
and Helen was inclined,

36:35.059 --> 36:37.762
but nobody's sure,
and you know why?

36:37.796 --> 36:39.998
Because Mitchell Wheeler
is a good-looking man,

36:40.031 --> 36:41.065
and I'm the fat girl.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.501
It isn't that, Ellenor.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.136
It's exactly that, Rebecca.
Exactly that.

36:45.169 --> 36:47.972
Why would a man
like Mitchell Wheeler
make a pass at me?

36:48.006 --> 36:49.608
It's exactly that.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.812
You know what
Judge Kittleson said?

36:53.845 --> 36:58.016
That my "romantic desperation"
is fodder for gossip down there.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.487
And when I had a baby
using a sperm donor--

37:02.521 --> 37:05.490
well, that was because
I had no choice, right?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.792
I mean, what man
would marry me?

37:07.826 --> 37:11.630
It couldn't possibly be that
I wanted to be a single parent.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.833
Before you spend the rest
of the day feeling sorry
for yourself,

37:14.866 --> 37:17.869
remember you did get a good
result for the client.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.771
This will eventually be
a victory.

37:19.804 --> 37:21.906
That's another bigotry
we face, Rebecca.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.808
What?

37:23.842 --> 37:26.545
People assume that fat girls
just sit around

37:26.578 --> 37:27.946
feeling sorry for themselves.

37:27.979 --> 37:31.082
I'm not sitting here
feeling sorry.
I'm angry!

37:31.115 --> 37:32.551
Can you understand that?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.018
I am angry!

37:38.189 --> 37:41.893
(praying in Spanish)

37:46.297 --> 37:47.799
(whispers)
What do you think?

37:47.832 --> 37:49.568
I don't know.
I think maybe--

37:51.035 --> 37:52.170
I don't know.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.405
(knock on door)

37:55.940 --> 37:57.442
(sighs)

38:15.226 --> 38:17.329
Madam Foreperson,
have you reached a verdict?

38:18.296 --> 38:19.498
We have, Your Honor.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.866
What say you?

38:21.900 --> 38:24.869
In the matter of Commonwealth
vs. Miguel Havalera,

38:24.903 --> 38:28.106
as to the count of murder
in the second degree,

38:28.139 --> 38:31.443
we the jury find the defendant,
Miguel Havalera...

38:31.476 --> 38:32.577
...guilty.

38:40.118 --> 38:43.688
JUDGE: Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.025
This matter is--

38:52.597 --> 38:53.798
This matter--

38:58.403 --> 38:59.771
While I find

38:59.804 --> 39:02.574
there is some evidence to allow
for the conclusion

39:02.607 --> 39:04.576
that the defendant committed
the crime,

39:06.578 --> 39:09.348
I find no reasonable jury

39:09.381 --> 39:11.215
could reach
the verdict that it did

39:11.249 --> 39:12.717
based upon the evidence

39:12.751 --> 39:14.453
that has been presented to it.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.891
I hereby set aside the verdict
and enter a finding...

39:21.025 --> 39:22.394
...of not guilty.

39:22.427 --> 39:24.396
The defendant is free to go.

39:24.429 --> 39:25.263
(gavel bangs)

39:30.302 --> 39:31.403
(sobbing)

39:34.839 --> 39:36.841
(sighs)

39:56.127 --> 39:57.862
(sighs)

40:04.202 --> 40:05.169
Hey.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.609
It's, uh, not right
for a man to cry.

40:10.642 --> 40:11.976
I had to come in.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.715
I think, under
the circumstances,

40:16.748 --> 40:18.249
you can cry, Miguel.

40:19.884 --> 40:21.152
One day...

40:22.687 --> 40:25.390
(voice breaking)
...I will repay you,
Mr. Berluti.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.158
Don't worry about that.

40:28.493 --> 40:29.661
(sniffles)

40:37.369 --> 40:39.604
You no doubt feel like
a proud man, Mr. Berluti.

40:40.905 --> 40:42.474
But you're not a proud man.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.643
You betrayed me.

40:44.676 --> 40:47.846
Reverend, when you came
to the Courthouse,

40:47.879 --> 40:50.649
it was because you had to.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.150
And that Judge's ruling,

40:52.183 --> 40:54.553
it had everything to do
with you coming forward.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.688
I didn't come forward.

40:56.721 --> 40:59.958
You dragged me forward,
after pledging your secrecy.

41:01.826 --> 41:03.762
I'm happy very for you, sir.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.465
But you betrayed me.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.910
Jimmy, Miguel still has to
check with probation

41:18.943 --> 41:20.679
before he can leave.
Okay.

41:28.286 --> 41:29.621
Oh, my God.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.827
Oh, my God.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.732
There was no congregant
who confessed, was there?

41:48.039 --> 41:51.009
You need to check with probation
before you can go.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.545
Okay. (clears throat)

42:01.052 --> 42:02.220
(door shuts)

42:17.602 --> 42:21.105
(music playing)

42:44.228 --> 42:44.996
You stinker!
