01:14.199 --> 01:15.992
Yeah, she set us up.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.161
You know, I bet you anything she
wanted us to die in that fire.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.788
Dude,
doesn't even matter.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.414
All right, we have Murphy.
And we still have

01:21.456 --> 01:22.999
a warrant to collect her DNA.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.209
Yeah, well,
I wanted all of them.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.668
Yeah, okay.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.420
At this point,
I'll take what I can get.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.922
Yeah, 'cause Murphy was

01:28.963 --> 01:30.048
who you really wanted.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.758
Like if you had to choose.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.595
Yeah, if I had
to choose, then...

01:35.637 --> 01:37.847
(chuckles) hell yeah.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.933
Hell yeah.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.601
I still can't believe
we just left her there.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.728
What were we
supposed to do?

01:46.397 --> 01:47.982
Turn the lights off.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.110
Yeah, I know.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.909
What do we do now?

01:59.577 --> 02:01.955
I don't know.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.374
I say we just
wait here,

02:20.348 --> 02:22.600
And I can't even...

02:22.642 --> 02:25.103
talk about Jess.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.772
I know we can't go back
to the arcade, but...

02:27.814 --> 02:31.025
I need to know...
if she was in there.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.278
I don't know how we're
supposed to do that.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.156
We just have to sit
here and wait it out.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.412
Darnell...
What?

02:42.453 --> 02:44.205
...knows people
that work with Josiah.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.999
Maybe they know
if she was in there.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.376
Can we at least call him?

The arcade was on fire.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.059
Wait, what?
Do you know anything?

03:05.101 --> 03:06.978
What do you mean it was on fire?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.396
Yeah, I don't know.
We never got Jess.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.023
We're kind of freaking
out over here.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.399
Have you heard anything?

03:11.441 --> 03:14.194
No, I...

03:14.235 --> 03:16.821
I think I might know
what happened.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.365
I'll find out and call you back.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.784
Did he know anything?

03:21.826 --> 03:23.995
He thinks he might.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.083
Trey, it's me.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.627
I know what you did.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.754
Answer your phone.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.970
Officer... Officer?

03:41.012 --> 03:42.889
Hello?

03:42.931 --> 03:45.183
Murphy, it's Josh.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.976
Is Jess okay?

03:47.018 --> 03:49.020
GENE:
We're finding that out.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.856
We need a sample of your DNA.
Why? What are you talking about?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.399
Why, why are you guys here?

03:53.441 --> 03:54.651
You should be doing something.

03:54.692 --> 03:55.902

We have a court order. Go ahead.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.505
Look, we don't know
anything yet, okay?

04:15.546 --> 04:18.132
They're still
putting out the fire.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.520

Still nothing from Darnell?

04:30.561 --> 04:33.106
No.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.317
I can't just sit here
any longer.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.529
Well, it's not like we can
just start driving around.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.615
The cops went past us
half an hour ago.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.742
I think we're fine.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.578
There's got to be
someone we know

04:47.620 --> 04:50.832
who can... find out
what's going on.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.543
Someone who has
access to cops.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.878
Fire department,
the paramedics.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.089
Oh, my God!

04:58.131 --> 05:00.591
I'm such an idiot!

05:00.633 --> 05:02.218
My sister!

05:02.260 --> 05:03.970
She was a public defender--
she knows everyone.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.014
Wait, you have a sister?

05:07.265 --> 05:09.267
Unfortunately.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.352
REPORTER:
The fire began
around 8:00 p.m. tonight.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.272
Firefighters are working
to control the deadly blaze,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.566
which has already burned
a number of structures.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.568
Word on the streets...

05:18.609 --> 05:20.403
Just listen, man.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.822
You were the only person
who knew the cops were coming.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.782
What'd you do?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.868
Tip off Josiah for a bonus?

05:26.909 --> 05:28.703
No.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.626
Look, I wanted to start
my own thing.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.879
So I told Beau to snag
as much as he could.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.757
You knew we promised
those drugs to the cops.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.967
We didn't promise
the cops anything.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.137
He was the only person I talked
to, and Alex caught him.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.097
Great, so she told Josiah.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.016
And he blew up the arcade
to get rid of the stash.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.478
With Jess inside.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.571
Look, if Alex
did tell Josiah,

06:03.613 --> 06:06.032
I feel like she would have tried
to get Jess out or something.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.618
They were, like, friends,
I do-- I don't know.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.286
Well, have you talked to her?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.330
No, she's not responding
to my texts.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.332
(sighs)

06:14.374 --> 06:16.167

Come on, buddy.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.074
Okay, we-we can't tell my sister
what's really going on.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.535
'Cause my first instinct is
to tell strangers

06:50.576 --> 06:52.870

You know,

07:11.180 --> 07:14.100
after three years,
perhaps a text is

07:14.142 --> 07:15.852
a less intrusive way
of creeping back into my life.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.938

07:26.112 --> 07:28.739
And who is
this handsome gentleman?

07:28.781 --> 07:31.451
Pretzel.
And does Pretzel shed?

07:31.492 --> 07:34.328
Sure does.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.793
Yeah, Murphy's here, in custody.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.629
SARAH:
So, once you get word that the
DNA matches, you'll charge her?

07:43.671 --> 07:45.506
Yeah, and then I'll cut her
a deal in exchange

07:45.548 --> 07:47.300
for a statement
against the chief.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.427
I can't believe that IRS guy
signed off on a deal,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.429
given his history with Murphy.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.807
He doesn't know
about it, does he?

07:54.849 --> 07:56.225
Not really.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.393
Wow.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.853
Hey, look, he would

07:58.895 --> 08:00.938
never agree to it.
No, I know.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.316
I just, I didn't think
you were that coldhearted.

08:03.357 --> 08:06.652
Oh, okay, she's still going
to jail, just for less time.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.906
Look, my job is to get
all the bad guys, not just one.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.574
Oh, I know.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.784
You're doing the right thing.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.995
Yeah, I know.

Okay, I, uh, I should get
back in there.

What if the DNA
doesn't match?

08:48.736 --> 08:51.489
Aw, man...

Okay, but that's enough

09:02.041 --> 09:04.669

with that evidence,

09:04.710 --> 09:06.837
there's...

09:06.879 --> 09:10.174
there's no way she can con--

I'm that stupid?

Clearly you're just waiting
on the DNA results

a confession from me

Um...
We're not sure.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.990

10:16.032 --> 10:18.117

Now we can't get
ahold of her.
Anyway...

10:20.620 --> 10:22.913
um, we thought
maybe you could call

10:22.955 --> 10:24.915
your old cop friends
and see if you can find

10:24.957 --> 10:27.918
anything out for us, 'cause
we're kind of freaking out here.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.004

gonna do it,

'cause I'm not a dick, but you
don't even talk to me anymore

10:34.050 --> 10:35.635

'cause you need a favor.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.470
Um, you don't talk to me either.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.975
I'll get my computer.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.936
(scoffs)

10:45.978 --> 10:47.605
MAX:
What was the context?

10:47.647 --> 10:50.483
Oh, I called her
a capitalist sellout whore.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.027
Because she is. She
was a public defender

10:53.069 --> 10:55.279
for, like, less than a year,
then moved to corporate finance

10:55.321 --> 10:57.490
after flying coach once.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.290
(phone vibrating)

11:09.919 --> 11:11.087
Hello?

11:11.128 --> 11:12.463
It's me.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.048
Have you heard anything
about Jess?

11:14.090 --> 11:17.009
No, not yet.
H-How's it going, uh, there?

11:17.051 --> 11:20.471
They, um...
(sniffles)

11:22.390 --> 11:24.684
...they took my DNA.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.481
Look, um...

11:30.523 --> 11:33.442
it's gonna be okay.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.443
Felix, please find out

11:34.485 --> 11:35.820
what happened to Jess.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.363
They're not telling me
anything here.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.532
I just feel like...

11:39.573 --> 11:41.784
I just feel like
I can't breathe.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.245
I know, I know. Me, too.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.913
I'm trying.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.082
Darnell is also trying.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.417
Okay.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.919
Bye.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.216
LESLEY:
Okay.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.051
This is gonna be

11:59.093 --> 12:01.387
super fun.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.103
Well, she's not gonna
incriminate herself on
a police line, is she?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.730
Do you really think if we could
find out what happened to Jess,

12:10.771 --> 12:12.231
she'll talk to us?
It's worth a shot.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.691
You just heard her.
Yeah.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.526
Jess is the only thing
she cares about right now.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.695
Okay. I'll make some phone
calls, see what I can find out.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.867
(door opens, closes)

12:31.959 --> 12:36.881
JESS:
You're not really gonna
confess to them... are you?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.884
If they have information
about you.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.510
Don't be an idiot.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.096
Look around, Jess...
(stammers)

12:44.138 --> 12:45.639
It's over.

12:49.226 --> 12:53.355
If someone could give me
anything about

12:53.397 --> 12:56.317
whether or not you're okay,
I'll take it.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.986
JESS:
Huh.
What?

12:59.028 --> 13:02.573
JESS:
I've just never seen
you give up before.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.242
MURPHY:
I'm not giving up. I got caught.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.660
JESS:
Just don't say anything.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.417
I'd literally rather go to jail
for the rest of my life

13:13.459 --> 13:14.835
than go one more second

13:14.877 --> 13:16.921
without knowing
what happened to you.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.716
Wow.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.971
You really are an idiot.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.390
(exhales)

13:28.432 --> 13:30.518
Yeah, maybe.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.272
Hold on.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.191
What?
Did she just say something?

13:37.233 --> 13:40.528
Uh, okay. Thanks, anyway.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.571
Uh, rewind it back?

13:47.868 --> 13:50.663
MURPHY (over device):
Yeah, maybe.

13:50.704 --> 13:53.290
Eh. Think she's just
losing it a bit.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.835
Yeah.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.419
Any word on Jess?

13:57.461 --> 13:59.129
Uh, CFD's still looking
through the wreckage.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.090
Trying to get
a preliminary report.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.177
LESLEY:
Oh.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.638
He retired.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.890
Let me try...
(sputters)

14:09.932 --> 14:11.976
Oh, no. He hates me.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.394
Oh...
Hang on.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.104
Oh, my God. Go slower.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.647
Seriously.
MAX:
Stop.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.315
She's helping us.
But she's doing it
on purpose.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.693
Yes. I want to keep you here
as long as possible

14:20.734 --> 14:23.112
so your B.O. can really seep
into my couch.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.864
(stifled laugh)

14:24.905 --> 14:28.158
Have you called
the kids' parents?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.493
What?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.662
The kids that your friend
was babysitting?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.372
If anything happened,
they would be the first to know.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.750
Oh, uh... I
don't know them.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.920
Can you just find
someone, please?

14:41.839 --> 14:45.050
Oh, wait. I helped this cop
get out of a lawsuit,

14:45.092 --> 14:46.677
and he owes me a favor.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.429
Wow.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.472
Congratulations on helping
a cop get out of a lawsuit.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.266
I'm sure you're super
proud of that one.

14:52.308 --> 14:56.020
Oscar? It's Lesley Bell,
how are you?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.479
GENE:
All right, thanks, man.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.814
(chuckles) Yeah,
I owe you a thousand beers.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.274
Okay, all right.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.234
They finished
their initial survey.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.279
No bodies.
No one died in that fire.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.364
Your friend wasn't in there.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.783
(sighs, chuckles)

15:09.825 --> 15:12.119
(exhales)
Okay.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.454
Wait.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.291
Then where is she?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.131
FELIX:
Max, we have to get out of here.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.382
We have to go find Jess.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.051
Felix, we can't
just go find her.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.886
You guys are
being so sketchy.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.680
No, we're not.
We just... are gonna go.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.682
Max?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.060
No. Your sister
was a defense attorney.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.269
I think she could help.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.520
Dude.
LESLEY:
Felix,

15:38.562 --> 15:39.480
what's going on?

15:39.521 --> 15:40.648
Nothing.
Nothing?

15:40.689 --> 15:41.732
Look around.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.942
I'm looking around.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.526
What a lovely display of, uh,

15:44.568 --> 15:46.403
floor-to-ceiling firewood
you have.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.238
Let's go.
We need help.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.199
We do not need help from her.
Oh, oh, we don't?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.785
No.
Are you forgetting that we made
a deal to turn ourselves in?

15:52.826 --> 15:54.745
We need a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.872
No you're not.
You didn't pass the bar.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.040
Shut up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:58.082 --> 15:58.999
No.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.084
No, no.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.293
We are talking to your sister.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.628
Okay, what about Jess?

16:02.670 --> 16:03.921
Well, at least
we know she's alive,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.381
because if we go back out there,

16:05.422 --> 16:06.757
we're gonna end up
right where Murphy is.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.425
What is going on?

16:08.467 --> 16:09.385
Zero.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.679
Everything is cool-- Ow! Ow!

16:11.720 --> 16:13.722
No. Tell me
what's going on.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.308
No.
(grunts, screams)

16:16.350 --> 16:18.519
We were forced to launder
money for a drug dealer

16:18.560 --> 16:20.187
and now the cops think
we killed her!

16:20.229 --> 16:23.273
You were laundering money
for a drug dealer?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.234
Yeah. That's what I just said.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.278
Why do the cops
think you killed her?

16:28.320 --> 16:29.613
I have no idea. Ow!

16:29.655 --> 16:31.490
Because we did!

16:35.828 --> 16:38.539
She was gonna kill our friend.
We had no choice.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.961
Wow.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.921
I know.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.465
I don't know
what's more shocking,

16:48.507 --> 16:50.467
that you murdered someone
or that you have friends.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.765
Okay.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.102
Every case has a defense.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.812
Even this one.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.856
Let me see
what I can do.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.408
Well? Did you find her?

17:14.450 --> 17:17.119
We did.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.246
Are you ready to talk?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.752
Yes.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.420
Just tell me.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.505
Sure.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.507
Once you tell us what happened
the night of November 24th.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.093
I swear, I'm-I'm-- I'll tell you
everything you need,

17:33.135 --> 17:34.470
but I'm not doing that
without finding out

17:34.511 --> 17:36.430
what happened to Jess first.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.975
Fine.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.522
She wasn't in the fire.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.610
She wasn't?

17:49.651 --> 17:51.195
No.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.906
Are you lying to me?

17:53.947 --> 17:55.699
I wouldn't do that.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.867
Then where is she?

17:56.909 --> 17:57.951
We don't know.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.787
All we can confirm

17:59.828 --> 18:03.332
is that there were no bodies
found in the arcade wreckage.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.880
Now it's your turn.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.009
Tell us what you did
to Nia Bailey.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.847
(laughs softly)

18:18.889 --> 18:20.974
No.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.854
No, that wasn't the deal.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.065
Mm-mm.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.150
I said I would confess
if you found Jess.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.069
Oh, come on Murphy.
Look, we found out Jess

18:32.111 --> 18:33.904
wasn't in the fire,
now tell us what you did to...

18:33.946 --> 18:36.990
No. Find where
she is-- The hell?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.576
I am so done
negotiating with you!

18:39.618 --> 18:41.912
You're gonna rot in prison
for the rest of your life,

18:41.954 --> 18:43.372
and you keep wondering
what happened to your friend

18:43.413 --> 18:45.082
from behind bars.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.625
Good luck.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.296
You forgot your cane.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.692
Wow, so your friend

19:11.733 --> 19:15.404
was sleeping with the cop,
the IRS dude and him?

19:15.445 --> 19:16.905
Yeah.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.117
Yeah.
LESLEY: So you're the only guy
in her life she hasn't boned?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.952
I mean, I guess that makes
sense. Who would want to take

19:21.994 --> 19:23.453
a 33-year-old's virginity?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.164
(stifled laugh)
FELIX: Mm.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.291
Funny joke. You do
know that I had sex

19:27.332 --> 19:29.001
with Nikki Anderson at Brad
Leventhal's Halloween party.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.419
Oh, my God.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.837
She doesn't remember that
even happening.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.298
She was too drunk.
No one believes you.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.966
Well, it happened.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.593
Why are you insisting
that you had sex with a girl

19:37.634 --> 19:39.469
who was too drunk to remember?

19:39.511 --> 19:41.889
Because she wasn't, okay?
I was with her all night,

19:41.930 --> 19:43.056
she had, like,
half a beer,

19:43.098 --> 19:44.391
then she made up
this whole lie

19:44.433 --> 19:46.059
about how she was
too blacked out

19:46.101 --> 19:47.436
because she doesn't want
to admit she had sex with me.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.188
Still not great.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.564
Can we just get back

19:50.606 --> 19:51.732
to Murphy, please?
LESLEY: Mm, sure.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.567
If that DNA matches,

19:53.609 --> 19:55.986
uh, your girl's gonna go to
prison for the rest of her life.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.237
What?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.156
Uh, can't you find

19:59.198 --> 20:00.782
some loophole or something?

20:00.824 --> 20:02.534
Isn't that what you do,
you find loopholes?

20:02.576 --> 20:05.537
Find one.
Uh, a loophole
for finding her blood

20:05.579 --> 20:07.206
and the victim's blood
at the scene of the crime?

20:07.247 --> 20:10.083
No. I can't do that.
No one could.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.754
(sighs)

20:13.795 --> 20:15.297
JOSH: I'm sorry, man. I...
GENE: It's okay.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.715
JOSH:
No, I-I blew it.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.927
It's fine.
I-- She's just... maddening.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.304
She was probably never
gonna confess to us anyway.
Yeah.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.389
And, look, we know
that DNA evidence will be enough

20:24.431 --> 20:26.516
for an arrest at least.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.726
Then we'll have
all the time in the world

20:27.768 --> 20:29.186
to build a case against her.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.437
Don't worry.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.439
Okay. Uh...
(sniffles)

20:32.481 --> 20:35.067
Uh, I'm gonna go
get some fresh air.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.401
That's a good idea, man.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.112
Hey, it's gonna take a while.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.948
Why don't you go
home, get some rest

20:40.989 --> 20:43.575
and come back in
a couple hours?
Yeah.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.036
Well, before we book you,

22:09.077 --> 22:11.371
I need a statement
about the chief.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.622
What?

22:12.664 --> 22:14.124
About how he
helped Dean cover up

22:14.166 --> 22:15.834
the Tyson Parker murder.

22:15.876 --> 22:19.588
If you can do that for me,
I can cut you a deal.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.715

but I promise you

22:21.757 --> 22:23.800

22:27.512 --> 22:29.389
Um...
Come on, Murphy, look.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.807
Just tell me what happened

22:30.849 --> 22:33.143
the night that Dean Riley
got arrested.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.145
What happened at that hospital?

22:37.522 --> 22:40.025
How much less time
are we talking?

22:40.067 --> 22:41.985

it's under five.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.695
What about Josh?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.405
He-he wouldn't agree
to this.
Don't worry about Josh.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.240
What's said between me and
him is between me and him.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.742
Hmm.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.160
Or you didn't tell him.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.371
You want to make the deal
or not?

22:55.290 --> 22:56.666
Yeah, I do.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.587
Yes, I do.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.466
Uh...
Get your tape recorder.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.178
Well, everything in-in the
room is already recorded,

23:08.220 --> 23:10.597

Uh, Dean Riley was
a detective here.

23:23.151 --> 23:27.656
And he told me
that he killed Tyson Parker.

23:29.157 --> 23:32.828
Tyson was
a 17-year-old boy

23:32.869 --> 23:34.830
who happened to be
my friend.

23:36.957 --> 23:40.419
And Dean told me
that he strangled him

23:40.460 --> 23:42.546
and shot him

23:42.587 --> 23:45.674
and threw his body in the river.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.595
And I recorded
Dean's confession,

23:50.637 --> 23:53.557
but then he tried to kill me,
too, um...

23:53.598 --> 23:56.643
We got in this crazy
car accident,

23:56.685 --> 23:58.353
and...

23:58.395 --> 24:01.523
when we got to the hospital,
I handed my phone

24:01.565 --> 24:03.900
over to the police
with the confession,

24:03.942 --> 24:05.902
and...

24:05.944 --> 24:08.071
and they arrested Dean.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.866
But then
the next time I saw him,

24:10.907 --> 24:14.411
the charges had been dropped
and...

24:14.453 --> 24:17.330
and he was released back
onto the Force.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.624
And do you know
how that happened?

24:21.042 --> 24:22.919
Um...

24:22.961 --> 24:24.629
Well, I asked a nurse,

24:24.671 --> 24:27.591
and she said that Dean
only had one visitor...

24:29.551 --> 24:33.180
...his boss, the chief.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.809
And when he left,
Dean was free.

I'll meet her outside.

32:35.578 --> 32:37.705
Well, it was...

32:37.747 --> 32:40.208
weird to see you.

32:40.249 --> 32:42.210
You, too.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.380
And I guess you won, Lesley.

32:45.421 --> 32:47.548
Look at your life.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.968
And look at mine.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.429
Yeah.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.722
(chuckles)

32:54.764 --> 32:56.182
I hate you.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.767
Makes sense.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.610
Seriously, what happened?

33:07.652 --> 33:09.821
You used to be, like,
a compulsive showerer.
I've been living

33:09.862 --> 33:10.947
out of my car.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.115
Leave me alone.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.783
Just...

33:13.825 --> 33:16.244
Nice to meet you.
Thanks for the pasta.

33:16.285 --> 33:19.038
Mm.
It was... really good.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.917
Yeah, no problem.

do you mind driving?

33:33.553 --> 33:35.054
Oh, sure. Yeah.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.597
Sorry, I would've
offered.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.016
I just thought,
'cause it's your car...

33:38.057 --> 33:40.476
No, you can have it.
I don't need it.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.937
I'm gonna head back to Canada.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.231
Just drop me
at the train station.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.524
Oh.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.401
Um... sure.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.319
I mean, you know,
we're heading to Canada, too,

33:50.361 --> 33:51.487
after we get Jess.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.905
Yeah, I know. I just...

33:52.947 --> 33:54.907
just want to get out
of here, so...

33:54.949 --> 33:56.701
Just drop me if you don't mind.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.037
Sure, yeah.
Yeah. Cool.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.164
Thanks.

34:01.205 --> 34:06.127
Uh, just so I know, like, what
do you want me to tell Murphy?

34:06.169 --> 34:08.254
I don't know. I don't care.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.967
I'll be sure to sugarcoat that.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.594

34:16.637 --> 34:18.973

cameras, man, and everything.

Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

34:22.351 --> 34:25.313
But we're
gonna find her.
No. We won't.

Yeah.
