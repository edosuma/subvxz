00:29.643 --> 00:33.835
And maintain, we bow 
and pray in silence. 

00:37.413 --> 00:40.719
Maggie, a song is not made for this. 

00:41.040 --> 00:42.048
Homer! 

00:42.147 --> 00:43.954
What? I forgot to pick me 
teeth this morning. 

00:45.910 --> 00:48.121
Something wrong with Maggie. 

00:48.133 --> 00:49.963
We should take him to the doctor Hibbert. 

00:49.989 --> 00:51.575
But I do not see it anywhere. 

00:51.664 --> 00:55.801
The Hibbert now go to a place 
worship a little more noisy. 

00:57.361 --> 00:59.169
Shine, allows light ....

00:59.186 --> 01:00.232
Shine ... 

01:00.258 --> 01:01.414
On top of the lighthouse ... 

01:01.731 --> 01:03.047
Shine on me ... 

01:06.933 --> 01:08.273
Shine on the morning ... 

01:08.464 --> 01:09.637
That is impressive! 

01:09.646 --> 01:10.838
God provides black! 

01:10.863 --> 01:12.289
Shining light lunch. 

01:13.757 --> 01:15.270
Let the shine ... 

01:17.827 --> 01:18.427
Dr. Hibbert? 

01:19.421 --> 01:22.077
I hate to interrupt you 
while you rejoice, 

01:22.102 --> 01:24.221
but Maggie is very irritated. 

01:25.853 --> 01:28.632
It seems to be the first 
symptoms of chickenpox. 

01:28.645 --> 01:29.598
Say Amen! 

01:29.664 --> 01:30.587
Amen! 

01:30.975 --> 01:34.015
Maggie coat with this rental 
calamine and scabs will heal. 

01:34.037 --> 01:35.992
The scabs will heal! 

01:36.237 --> 01:38.375
The scabs will heal! 

01:38.389 --> 01:39.877
Cured my crusts, Lord! 

01:40.049 --> 01:41.254
Glory to God! 

01:41.524 --> 01:43.046
I can walk again! 

01:44.974 --> 01:46.882
What? My foot had fallen asleep. 

01:47.370 --> 01:51.956
Honey, I know that you itch, 
but you have to stop you scratching. 

01:52.545 --> 01:53.271
No! 

01:54.404 --> 01:55.535
No! 

01:55.667 --> 01:57.884
Voila, playing with your teddy bear. 

02:01.300 --> 02:03.145
My darling ... 

02:03.245 --> 02:05.052
Poor Maggie. 

02:05.495 --> 02:06.485
Homer, do not touch it! 

02:06.596 --> 02:08.237
You have never had chickenpox. 

02:08.422 --> 02:11.154
I know, and if you, and you're super ... 

02:11.177 --> 02:14.774
I just say that it is very 
dangerous to have as adults. 

02:14.841 --> 02:16.341
It can make you sterile ... 

02:17.041 --> 02:18.275
Here at the bottom. 

02:19.025 --> 02:20.905
You always feel obliged 
to be rude, Marge? 

02:22.936 --> 02:24.107
Value yourself. 

02:25.259 --> 02:27.464
Can not even go in my own kitchen ... 

02:27.505 --> 02:31.135
I bet Bart licks at this time 
even the whips of my thresher 

02:32.238 --> 02:33.014
Not worry Dad. 

02:33.090 --> 02:34.369
I keep a worry. 

02:34.973 --> 02:36.740
I just left in the mouth of the dog. 

02:36.836 --> 02:37.518
No! 

02:38.198 --> 02:38.739
Bart! 

02:38.997 --> 02:40.872
It is a very bad storage area! 

02:41.056 --> 02:42.817
Hey Homer, what makes you bitter? 

02:42.965 --> 02:44.797
Have you drunk ass dry one of these sodas Puants? 

02:44.821 --> 02:46.063
I do not know, maybe. 

02:46.211 --> 02:47.884
Besides my wife keeps me going back more 

02:47.922 --> 02:49.882
because the baby to chickenpox. 

02:50.249 --> 02:53.507
Really? It t'embÃªterait that I bring my 
it can infect boys Rod and Todd? 

02:53.568 --> 02:55.673
There will then chickenpox in both houses. 

02:55.853 --> 02:57.087
Why would you do that? 

02:57.162 --> 02:58.354
Are you a bad parent? 

02:58.442 --> 02:59.955
On the contrary, bald man. 

03:00.041 --> 03:02.155
You see, Rodd and Todd can not 
having chickenpox once, 

03:02.168 --> 03:03.945
and childhood is the best time course. 

03:04.119 --> 03:06.297
So you want Maggie infects your kids? 

03:06.444 --> 03:07.546
Got all included. 

03:07.574 --> 03:10.268
In fact, some parents are known to 
organizing a celebration to chickenpox 

03:10.455 --> 03:13.617
so that other children in the neighborhood 
patients can be safe. 

03:13.739 --> 03:16.137
And they pay generously for this privilege? 

03:16.169 --> 03:16.857
Well, they could. 

03:17.005 --> 03:19.156
But you really would be a horrible tightwad 

03:19.353 --> 03:20.964
to charge your friends and neighbors ... 

03:21.013 --> 03:22.776
$ 15 to infect your children. 

03:23.168 --> 03:24.723
And here is the chickenpox box! 

03:24.812 --> 03:26.642
The box is not recommended chickenpox 
pregnant women. 

03:26.643 --> 03:28.339
As each box disease, 
results may vary. 

03:28.560 --> 03:29.252
Box chickenpox. 

03:29.719 --> 03:31.501
Welcome to our feast to chickenpox. 

03:31.961 --> 03:34.807
Keep some space for the punch. 
Maggie bathing in the pool. 

03:40.903 --> 03:42.243
Luann will pick Milhouse 

03:42.267 --> 03:43.306
at the end of the festival. 

03:43.385 --> 03:45.197
I will read in the car so far. 

03:47.135 --> 03:50.196
Kirk, join the 
parents in the kitchen. 

03:50.400 --> 03:52.097
It was alcoholic beverages, 

03:52.146 --> 03:54.285
and critical parents who are not there. 

03:54.375 --> 03:56.932
Ordinarily, I am not 
kind of laughing problems 

03:56.957 --> 03:59.059
urinary people, but you 
should have seen it ... 

03:59.360 --> 04:00.405
Oh, that's it. 

04:02.114 --> 04:05.691
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome 
sister full of blisters ... 

04:05.895 --> 04:07.494
The toddler covered buttons ... 

04:07.852 --> 04:08.934
Maggie! 

04:17.204 --> 04:19.233
I already feel chicken. 

04:19.605 --> 04:21.745
I just lay an egg in my pants. 

04:25.777 --> 04:26.716
Hey, Marge. 

04:26.834 --> 04:29.182
Make blow a little more of that, 
stupid slug. 

04:29.287 --> 04:30.967
Chief, you think you have not drunk enough? 

04:31.040 --> 04:31.839
I'm fine. 

04:31.874 --> 04:34.033
Look, I can even touch 
my nose with my gun. 

04:35.155 --> 04:37.348
Not worry, I am the pef of Cholic. 

04:37.373 --> 04:39.673
I mean, I'm beef without cheese. 

04:40.356 --> 04:42.043
Why is it that Lou does not like me? 

04:42.915 --> 04:43.686
Why? 

04:44.362 --> 04:45.077
Knock, knock. 

04:45.324 --> 04:47.144
Luann, what are you doing here? 

04:47.205 --> 04:49.100
I thought you just filed Milhouse. 

04:49.218 --> 04:50.914
I can take a coffee and return later. 

04:50.976 --> 04:52.462
No, no, no, you stay. 

04:52.488 --> 04:53.758
I will go home by car. 

04:53.852 --> 04:55.610
Who let me siphon? 

04:55.659 --> 04:59.336
Why do not you stay two 
and enjoy one of my ARITAS Line? 

04:59.409 --> 05:00.326
Very good! 

05:00.383 --> 05:03.562
I never drank one without cigarette inside. 

05:04.042 --> 05:06.907
Well, children, instead of one 
these things and inflatable jumping, 

05:06.968 --> 05:10.017
please welcome Mr. Krusty the clown! 

05:11.328 --> 05:12.532
Oh oh oh children! 

05:14.249 --> 05:17.007
This idiot has paid for 
20 seconds, then listen up. 

05:17.409 --> 05:20.218
Moishe had caught chickenpox, 
and scratch day and night. 

05:20.335 --> 05:22.314
He asked the rabbi what to do, 
and he replied ... 

05:22.474 --> 05:23.699
Fini. I breaks. 

05:30.529 --> 05:31.726
Kirk, you look good. 

05:31.852 --> 05:33.020
You have made your muscles? 

05:33.056 --> 05:35.044
Well, dogs have continued ... 

05:35.142 --> 05:36.753
Nobody has continued recently. 

05:36.802 --> 05:38.471
What has happened to your last boyfriend? 

05:38.666 --> 05:41.457
Anyone who was always at the gym 
According have you visited 

05:41.469 --> 05:43.068
and then went to dinner c't'endroit in town. 

05:43.194 --> 05:44.734
You know, his taillight is broken. 

05:45.348 --> 05:46.651
I do see more. 

05:46.798 --> 05:49.241
Does this mean that I have a chance? 

05:50.476 --> 05:53.082
Almost everyone has a chance now. 

05:55.615 --> 05:56.938
Goodbye, thank you for coming. 

05:56.974 --> 05:58.998
If my birthday you made ill, talk to your friends. 

06:03.792 --> 06:06.189
Holy Lizzie McGuire! 

06:06.472 --> 06:07.890
You think it's shocking? 

06:09.389 --> 06:10.989
Mr. stomach, you hungry? 

06:11.249 --> 06:12.380
I have always hungry. 

06:12.552 --> 06:14.480
Then sends pizza, wholesale. 

06:15.967 --> 06:17.219
You are the stomach. 

06:22.779 --> 06:23.815
I do this for my job. 

06:39.161 --> 06:39.384
And here y'avait his mother and 
father doing ... 

06:39.947 --> 06:40.098
Mr Van Houten, I love when you m'embrasses! 

06:40.305 --> 06:40.453
Yeah, yeah, kissing women, 
this is best. 

06:41.081 --> 06:41.877
Baby, kissing my mouth. 

06:42.080 --> 06:43.715
Mm, kiss me as if we 
were in a hotel imagination. 

06:44.314 --> 06:45.601
Okay, we have understood! 

06:46.254 --> 06:49.371
Marge, what happens? 

06:50.573 --> 06:52.232
Homie, you have caught chickenpox. 

06:52.595 --> 06:54.121
But how? 

06:54.414 --> 06:55.273
I do not know. 

06:55.441 --> 06:56.433
I stayed away from Maggie 
all day. 

06:56.939 --> 07:00.369
I'm so high! 

07:00.906 --> 07:09.698
Son, we want you to talk about 

07:09.907 --> 07:11.272
what you saw in Simpson. 

07:11.653 --> 07:13.818
I have not seen anything that can 
I restore hope, 

07:13.990 --> 07:15.417
if that's what you mean. 

07:15.778 --> 07:17.761
Maybe you should have some hope. 

07:18.149 --> 07:19.403
I already full! 

07:19.575 --> 07:20.601
Full lip! 

07:20.795 --> 07:24.329
Your father and I will try what 
called "separation test." 

07:24.584 --> 07:26.715
And, son, one thing must be clear. 

07:26.960 --> 07:29.601
Contrary to our separation, 
this is not your fault. 

07:29.884 --> 07:31.540
I can not believe it. 

07:31.805 --> 07:34.372
Our family will be reunited again! 

07:36.040 --> 07:39.637
Our house is a very, very, 

07:39.812 --> 07:44.443
very fine house with two cats in the yard 

07:44.648 --> 07:51.531
life used to be so hard now everything is easy 

07:51.636 --> 07:58.289
'cause of you and now ... 

07:59.012 --> 08:12.104
I did not dream in color 
for so long. 

08:13.641 --> 08:16.552
Thank you god. We were afraid to have you lost. 

08:18.513 --> 08:20.514
You stay seated in this flour 
oats for a few minutes 

08:20.658 --> 08:22.111
and it will disappear your chickenpox. 

08:22.686 --> 08:23.570
Homer! 

08:23.765 --> 08:26.518
Mmm ... Homer-oats. 

08:26.777 --> 08:28.848
Stop eating oatmeal. 

08:29.032 --> 08:30.591
This is the third bath that you eat. 

08:32.248 --> 08:33.200
Hello? 

08:33.345 --> 08:34.774
No, I just did not work today. 

08:34.956 --> 08:36.326
I chickenpox. 

08:36.736 --> 08:39.940
I know I already said that the 
Last month, but I was lying. 

08:40.488 --> 08:41.711
Sheesh. 

08:41.890 --> 08:42.722
Ok. Ok. 

08:43.128 --> 08:45.149
Ok. Ok. Ok 

08:45.550 --> 08:47.340
Ok. I love you. Bye. 

08:47.927 --> 08:49.130
I have just been fired. 

08:49.291 --> 08:50.599
I'd better look at the job. 

08:51.656 --> 08:53.439
Need for truck drivers in Iraq. 

08:54.878 --> 08:57.032
The trucks are like big cars. 

08:58.676 --> 08:59.540
Ok, Luann. 

08:59.875 --> 09:01.458
For more dignity, we should 
tell everyone 

09:01.679 --> 09:04.401
that we came out together for 
that we were separated. 

09:04.637 --> 09:06.463
Well, the captain and me ... 

09:06.702 --> 09:07.480
I do not know. 

09:07.607 --> 09:08.073
I do not know. 

09:08.360 --> 09:09.327
I do not know! 

09:09.558 --> 09:11.169
So what we do 
Family today? 

09:11.316 --> 09:12.537
Mini? The pedals? 

09:12.672 --> 09:13.998
The escalation? 

09:14.159 --> 09:15.329
Milly ... 

09:15.632 --> 09:16.711
The botanical garden? 

09:16.880 --> 09:17.630
A factory of ours? 

09:17.748 --> 09:19.259
Arena football with the Stun Springfield? 

09:19.416 --> 09:20.599
Not today, my grandfather. 

09:20.759 --> 09:22.087
Your father and I need 
more time to ... 

09:22.248 --> 09:23.384
to know each other again. 

09:24.615 --> 09:25.790
Why you kidding? 

09:25.937 --> 09:27.028
Tell me! 

09:27.222 --> 09:28.489
The privates jokes, is invalid. 

09:28.993 --> 09:30.275
Son, ten tickets. 

09:30.528 --> 09:32.592
Why do not you go bowling 

09:32.720 --> 09:33.512
launch a few balls? 

09:33.640 --> 09:35.270
But that night the league. 

09:36.478 --> 09:39.549
This de-separation test stinks. 

09:39.688 --> 09:42.192
My parents used to be 
competing for my love, 

09:42.329 --> 09:44.494
And I received lots of money. 

09:44.743 --> 09:46.823
And I always kept the currency. 

09:47.024 --> 09:50.638
Movies at the drive-in, two Christmases, 
soda with dinner ... 

09:50.778 --> 09:53.190
We lived like kings. 

09:53.496 --> 09:56.815
Remember when you said to me, 
father to go to bed, and he has done? 

09:57.037 --> 09:58.526
It was a New Year 

09:58.692 --> 09:59.577
Hear me. 

09:59.730 --> 10:02.503
I think we should separate your parents. 

10:02.622 --> 10:03.949
I do not know, Bart. 

10:04.087 --> 10:05.296
I wanted to see them together again 
for so long. 

10:05.591 --> 10:07.453
Look, you know they will split again? 

10:07.614 --> 10:09.143
Why not just speed things up? 

10:09.404 --> 10:11.551
You know, Bart, my imaginary friend 

10:11.693 --> 10:13.079
never did make 
I thought things wrong. 

10:14.232 --> 10:16.696
That is why he has to leave forever. 

10:16.840 --> 10:19.134
I thought you were let go. 

10:19.269 --> 10:23.023
I'm afraid it must pass a 
another year to seek his brain. 

10:23.217 --> 10:29.536
Luann, I back my stuff! 

10:29.706 --> 10:34.592
Dad ... Mom said that big you are and you pues. 

10:34.742 --> 10:37.140
Your mother said that? 

10:38.878 --> 10:40.172
It's so good. 

10:40.372 --> 10:42.730
It kept its critics at the bottom of it, 

10:42.877 --> 10:44.919
until they destroy our marriage. 

10:45.200 --> 10:47.971
And I think I smell a little. 

10:48.184 --> 10:50.528
That is what these samples 
Water Cologne. 

10:56.109 --> 10:58.839
Mom, I do not want to create 
Dad problems, but ... 

10:59.310 --> 11:01.797
it left me drinking a beer! 

11:02.558 --> 11:05.182
I have the impression that there is a problem there. 

11:06.253 --> 11:08.683
The problem is that you t'adonnes to lie. 

11:08.861 --> 11:10.831
I'm drunk! I'll prove it. 

11:11.087 --> 11:13.589
Look at me ... embrace this picture of Nana. 

11:15.454 --> 11:18.445
I can not do. 

11:18.583 --> 11:19.983
It is so mean to me. 

11:20.152 --> 11:22.572
It will not let me eat Fruit Loops! 

11:25.247 --> 11:27.624
Maybe my dad and my mom have 
intend to stay together, Bart. 

11:28.368 --> 11:31.623
You better hope otherwise, 
because you know what will happen after? 

11:31.886 --> 11:32.790
Your worst nightmare: 

11:32.927 --> 11:34.015
A little sister. 

11:34.243 --> 11:35.824
Hi, Bart. I brought you cookies. 

11:35.958 --> 11:37.942
Thank you for nothing, my old. 

11:40.189 --> 11:43.002
If it does not bother you, I would watch 

11:43.142 --> 11:44.772
This series of cool on fox 
Teen Orange County. 

11:44.963 --> 11:47.431
Austin! 

11:47.593 --> 11:48.925
I was looking for my ring 

11:49.053 --> 11:51.290
in your recording studio, and I found it! 

11:51.438 --> 11:54.097
It belongs to Feather, yes or no? 

11:54.762 --> 11:56.204
Sorry, Jade. 

11:56.367 --> 11:57.600
This is how we live in O.C. 

11:57.774 --> 11:58.845
You betrayed me! 

11:59.007 --> 12:00.620
Our adventure is over interracial. 

12:00.762 --> 12:01.560
Whatever. 

12:01.708 --> 12:02.997
Will put the mess at Knott's 
Berry Farm (theme park in the U.S.). 

12:03.126 --> 12:04.967
Ok, man. 

12:05.077 --> 12:07.373
We will enter this ancient 
lint in the bigfoot rapids. 

12:07.509 --> 12:09.285
I'll slip into the canal ... 

12:09.436 --> 12:10.955
Log style! 

12:11.181 --> 12:13.596
We've been on the run, drivin 'in the sun 

12:13.737 --> 12:16.117
lookin 'out for number one 

12:16.248 --> 12:19.252
California, here we come right back 

12:19.415 --> 12:23.453
Where we started from hustlers, grab your guns, 

12:23.578 --> 12:28.149
your shadow weighs a ton 
driving down the 101 

12:28.301 --> 12:31.965
California, here we come right back 

12:32.117 --> 12:34.274
where we started from California ... 

12:34.414 --> 12:45.497
California ... here we come ... 

12:46.065 --> 12:49.034
I bet that the bra was 
put there by Sterling to make them 

12:49.325 --> 12:50.867
It is a brilliant idea. 

12:51.053 --> 12:53.117
These writers are great! 

12:53.315 --> 12:55.706
No matter how much they are paid, it is not enough. 

12:56.092 --> 12:58.387
This bra will awaken, 

12:58.663 --> 13:01.772
suspicions of your mother and your parents separate. 

13:02.100 --> 13:03.293
Milhouse! 

13:03.452 --> 13:05.710
I need fingers purposes for 
catch me pickles! 

13:10.043 --> 13:11.595
It is not for me. 

13:18.360 --> 13:20.431
I have a message for your wife, 

13:20.540 --> 13:22.107
Stop sleeping with my husband! 

13:22.474 --> 13:25.309
"... with my husband ..." 

13:25.524 --> 13:26.997
and you ...? 

13:27.117 --> 13:29.226
The wife of the lover of your wife. 

13:29.497 --> 13:30.845
She knows what it concerns? 

13:31.027 --> 13:33.279
Freak! Marge has an adventure with Kirk! 

13:34.017 --> 13:35.356
This is ridiculous! 

13:35.534 --> 13:37.923
No woman would want to sleep with this loser! 

13:39.782 --> 13:42.744
I ... and congratulations on 
you will be returned with him. 

13:42.877 --> 13:43.492
A good thing. 

13:43.635 --> 13:44.628
Just answer a question. 

13:44.776 --> 13:47.633
How the bra your wife 
ended in a bed with my husband? 

13:47.821 --> 13:54.208
This is the bra of Marge. 

13:54.350 --> 13:56.171
I bought for her tits! 

13:56.808 --> 14:00.750
Of all the people that margin could betray, 
why did it take me whatsoever? 

14:01.597 --> 14:03.584
Oh, I'm tired. 

14:03.808 --> 14:08.026
If you want to return a melon 
groceries, take your day. 

14:08.320 --> 14:10.764
Well, it answers the question of melon disappeared, 

14:10.919 --> 14:12.563
but I have another question: 

14:12.964 --> 14:15.035
Have you slept with Kirk Van Houten? 

14:15.423 --> 14:17.002
How can you ask me this question? 

14:17.302 --> 14:19.509
I repeat, have you slept with Kirk? 

14:19.791 --> 14:21.397
Homer, you're crazy! 

14:21.548 --> 14:22.547
You do not say "no". 

14:22.709 --> 14:23.757
Well ... no! 

14:23.956 --> 14:25.222
I still hear 'no'. 

14:25.421 --> 14:26.713
No! No! No! 

14:26.869 --> 14:29.810
It seems to me that the lady protest too much! 

14:29.965 --> 14:31.405
You do not believe me? 

14:31.515 --> 14:34.688
After all peaceful 
buttons on your body ungrateful! 

14:34.909 --> 14:36.177
How dare you! 

14:36.316 --> 14:38.565
I'm still waiting for the "no". 

14:38.725 --> 14:40.293
Get out of my house! 

14:40.414 --> 14:41.503
With pleasure. 

14:56.799 --> 14:59.285
We tried to separate your parents 
and it is mine, which are separated. 

14:59.702 --> 15:02.789
You want to call my therapist 
and tell him how you feel? 

15:03.104 --> 15:04.763
Hello, Dr. Wexler? 

15:05.340 --> 15:07.180
Stop me! 

15:07.316 --> 15:09.008
I'm honeymoon! 

15:09.381 --> 15:10.987
Yeah, this kid is still weird. 

15:16.518 --> 15:17.527
Dad? 

15:17.859 --> 15:19.390
I thought Mom 
t'avais turned the house? 

15:19.635 --> 15:21.556
I came to get my mail. 

15:21.770 --> 15:23.322
Resident ... Occupant ... 

15:23.362 --> 15:23.411
I can not open them. 

15:25.659 --> 15:27.241
A ticket! 

15:31.787 --> 15:35.164
I would do anything to 
grab your mother and donut. 

15:35.377 --> 15:37.410
Ok, listen, you and Mom, you 
can arrange that. 

15:37.594 --> 15:39.753
What exactly has 
between you two? 

15:39.915 --> 15:41.127
Lisa, we do not need 
to know. 

15:41.291 --> 15:44.883
It is a natural thing that has taken place. 
As a hurricane, or make war. 

15:48.722 --> 15:49.292
Well, I'd better go. 

15:49.563 --> 15:51.100
Where is what you live? 

15:57.051 --> 15:57.051
You know the seasons'4 '? 

15:57.051 --> 15:57.051
Well, I experimented fully 

15:58.294 --> 15:58.385
since I live in a park. 

15:58.855 --> 15:59.520
Bart, I think you are behind 
this story. 

15:59.613 --> 16:00.549
Yes, I see how you can 
arrive at this conclusion. 

16:00.694 --> 16:02.414
but on the other hand ... 

16:02.660 --> 16:04.021
I read in you like a book. 

16:04.311 --> 16:05.813
You read books! 

16:06.036 --> 16:07.452
If you do not say this to Mom 
that you did, I would. 

16:07.637 --> 16:10.277
Go ... 

16:10.500 --> 16:12.359
It would be easier 
if our parents divorce? 

16:12.589 --> 16:14.753
And you get married offsets 
with a much older man. 

16:14.966 --> 16:16.868
Meanwhile, I would be a 
of these strange guys 

16:16.986 --> 16:19.371
35 years attending the match 
basketball in high schools. 

16:26.598 --> 16:29.207
Why did I married this idiot selfish? 

16:29.574 --> 16:32.430
I asked him in 1000 again retouner 
the mattress and it never did. 

16:38.536 --> 16:39.593
Mom? 

16:39.724 --> 16:40.826
Yes my heart. 

16:41.346 --> 16:43.981
Remember this bra 
which shattered our family? 

16:44.514 --> 16:49.175
On closer look, he 
find that I am responsible for that. 

16:49.484 --> 16:50.474
Really? 

16:50.683 --> 16:52.343
Well I will erase any 

16:52.540 --> 16:54.518
the saved games on your Playstation. 

16:54.790 --> 16:55.860
What? 

16:56.134 --> 16:57.836
How do you know the existence 
this kind of stuff? 

16:58.027 --> 17:00.246
I learned everything there. 
'Penalties PlugIns' 

17:01.052 --> 17:02.836
But dad can go home, right? 

17:03.134 --> 17:03.957
No. 

17:04.165 --> 17:04.957
But he is innocent. 

17:05.132 --> 17:05.816
Innocent? 

17:05.997 --> 17:07.247
After all what I did to your father, 
it has no confidence in me. 

17:07.517 --> 17:09.719
I finished with him. 

17:09.869 --> 17:13.624
Is this mean that you and Dad 
may D - I - V - O - R - S - S - E - R? 

17:13.983 --> 17:16.726
Young man, will work your spelling, 

17:16.923 --> 17:19.807
or I delete all ringtones 
Special your mobile. 

17:20.883 --> 17:22.483
No! 

17:22.780 --> 17:25.795
Our trap for parents has 
qu'agraver things. 

17:25.931 --> 17:28.316
Maybe we should use 
another film as a guide. 

17:28.532 --> 17:30.260
As Oklahoma. 

17:30.860 --> 17:34.385
The farmer and the cowboy should be friends. 

17:34.564 --> 17:38.413
The farmer and the cowboy should be friends. 

17:38.590 --> 17:40.566
one likes to pull his plow, 

17:40.710 --> 17:42.418
another likes hunting cows 

17:42.624 --> 17:45.853
but there is no reason 
so they are not friends. 

17:50.131 --> 17:51.501
What do you think Bart? 

17:51.711 --> 17:53.486
A Hoedown could solve all our problems. 

17:53.667 --> 17:55.093
I just need your chap size. 

17:55.267 --> 17:57.053
It's 2 sizes of more than 
that of your trousers. 

17:57.257 --> 17:59.007
How many times does it require that I have to tell you? 

17:59.141 --> 18:00.959
No Rodgers and Hammerstein! 

18:01.111 --> 18:02.260
Rodgers and Hart? 

18:02.507 --> 18:03.355
No! 

18:03.571 --> 18:05.918
Ok, and what we will do to 
calling your parents together? 

18:06.109 --> 18:07.845
Enough plans foireux! 

18:08.394 --> 18:11.357
The situations from films stupid 
do not apply in real life. 

18:11.519 --> 18:13.444
The marriage of Papa and Mama beats of the wing, 

18:13.613 --> 18:15.588
and they must cope with therapy 

18:15.741 --> 18:17.065
they must be sure that this marriage 
does not break again. 

18:17.403 --> 18:20.137
The rocks ... break ... the cliff ... 

18:20.318 --> 18:23.070
Lisa, you just give me a 
idea-fetched 

18:23.234 --> 18:25.580
for the most exciting plans infallible! 

18:25.990 --> 18:29.769
Ok, once my parents saw this puppet 

18:29.884 --> 18:31.150
falling into the river, they think that I, 

18:31.306 --> 18:32.683
and realize what is most important: 

18:32.834 --> 18:33.950
either. 

18:34.196 --> 18:35.514
Bart, is what you like puppet? 

18:35.666 --> 18:37.603
I pushed the resemblance to the smell. 

18:38.963 --> 18:41.970
Now we must ensure that Homer and Marge 
are well positioned to see the scene ... 

18:43.749 --> 18:47.235
I received your letter saying that you wanted 
meet me here to t'excuser. 

18:47.411 --> 18:50.014
Well, I got your letter saying that 

18:50.140 --> 18:51.763
you bring me a portion 
salad of potatoes. 

18:51.964 --> 18:53.018
Where are my apology? 

18:53.188 --> 18:54.411
Where is my potato salad? 

18:54.593 --> 18:56.068
I will draw the attention of my parents, 

18:56.184 --> 18:57.300
and you will throw the puppet in the water. 

18:57.517 --> 18:58.606
Questions? 

18:58.741 --> 19:00.160
Yeah, what you gonna 
dress up for Halloween? 

19:00.338 --> 19:01.558
A giant dog dirt. 

19:01.827 --> 19:02.621
're Off. 

19:03.049 --> 19:04.755
Mom! Dad! I play board 
a dangerous cliff ... 

19:05.924 --> 19:08.924
because you're too busy 
you compete for attention to me! 

19:09.787 --> 19:12.715
Bart! We are all very disappointed that there did not 
salad of potatoes, 

19:12.966 --> 19:14.736
but I prithee, does not jump! 

19:15.116 --> 19:16.180
Now. 

19:16.415 --> 19:19.466
I can not tell which is which. 

19:22.187 --> 19:26.588
I'm already being run. 

19:27.595 --> 19:29.565
I've done Bart! 

19:29.758 --> 19:31.406
Bart? 

19:32.073 --> 19:42.794
I come son! 

19:43.202 --> 20:00.788
All this is my fault. 

20:01.090 --> 20:03.668
It is I who put the bra Mom 
in a room with parents Milhouse. 

20:03.840 --> 20:07.207
Why kind of small .... 

20:07.502 --> 20:09.227
Homer, I can save you both! 

20:09.477 --> 20:11.386
Drop the rock! 

20:11.523 --> 20:12.917
Do it! Let me confidence! 

20:27.043 --> 20:28.671
Mom, Dad ... 

20:28.842 --> 20:31.322
I would give a million billion 
dollars that you submit it together. 

20:31.524 --> 20:33.059
Rather 2 million billion. 

20:33.235 --> 20:34.121
Homer! 

20:34.306 --> 20:35.587
1 million billion leave taxes! 

20:35.923 --> 20:38.842
I think that final, you have shown 
that you had confidence in me. 

20:39.347 --> 20:40.433
Of course I trust. 

20:40.633 --> 20:42.762
The only thing I can not believe 

20:42.939 --> 20:44.857
is to be married to a woman like you. 

20:45.147 --> 20:46.331
Oh Homer ... 

20:46.829 --> 20:50.113
Oh ... Margin. 

20:50.514 --> 20:52.506
Je ne veux pas vivre dans un monde 

20:52.643 --> 20:54.202
sans Bart! 

20:55.356 --> 20:56.906
Il sait nager? 

20:57.093 --> 20:58.570
A ton avis? 

20:59.226 --> 21:01.506
California 

21:01.738 --> 21:04.695
