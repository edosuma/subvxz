00:24.764 --> 00:32.479
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

00:48.746 --> 00:52.291
No, no, son. Over here.

00:52.333 --> 00:59.131
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.593
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

01:01.635 --> 01:05.304
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

01:05.346 --> 01:07.932
Da-da.

01:08.057 --> 01:12.228
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

01:12.269 --> 01:14.730
You see this mark?

01:14.772 --> 01:16.690
You and me are the same.

01:16.732 --> 01:20.109
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

01:20.151 --> 01:23.196
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

01:23.238 --> 01:25.991
No, Alakay. No dancing!

01:26.033 --> 01:28.494
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

01:28.536 --> 01:33.415
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

01:33.457 --> 01:35.708
Now, come on, let's try it again.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.710
No, Alakay.

01:37.752 --> 01:40.213
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

01:40.255 --> 01:43.716
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

01:43.758 --> 01:47.220
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

01:47.262 --> 01:51.724
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

01:51.766 --> 01:56.896
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

01:56.938 --> 02:00.316
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

02:00.358 --> 02:02.902
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

02:02.944 --> 02:06.196
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

02:06.238 --> 02:10.116
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

02:10.158 --> 02:13.204
We fight on three. One...

02:13.246 --> 02:17.417
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

02:17.458 --> 02:20.545
Two, three!

02:41.440 --> 02:44.109
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

02:44.151 --> 02:46.028
Don't you forget it.

02:46.069 --> 02:50.324
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

02:50.365 --> 02:53.075
Alakay?

02:56.370 --> 03:01.376
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

03:01.543 --> 03:04.004
This one's a beauty.

03:04.046 --> 03:06.590
He'll be worth a few bucks.

03:06.632 --> 03:10.801
It just gets easier and easier.

03:10.843 --> 03:12.094
Daddy!

03:12.136 --> 03:14.597
Alakay! Alakay!

03:14.639 --> 03:17.350
Alakay!

03:19.143 --> 03:21.729
Da-da!

03:21.771 --> 03:24.857
No! No! No!

03:26.859 --> 03:29.570
Alakay!

03:38.538 --> 03:44.125
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

03:46.044 --> 03:48.631
Da-da!

04:02.769 --> 04:05.480
Alakay!

04:10.945 --> 04:13.530
Daddy!

04:33.632 --> 04:37.220
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

04:37.262 --> 04:40.599
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

04:40.640 --> 04:43.726
Take me to a place
where they know my name

04:43.767 --> 04:47.104
'Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

04:47.146 --> 04:50.191
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

04:50.232 --> 04:53.903
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

04:53.944 --> 04:57.114
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

04:57.156 --> 05:00.326
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

05:00.367 --> 05:03.704
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

05:03.746 --> 05:07.625
Play that jungle fever
Show 'em some love

05:07.666 --> 05:09.710
Show love

05:09.752 --> 05:12.213
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

05:12.254 --> 05:14.797
To relate to, to relate to

05:14.839 --> 05:16.716
I'm feeling right at home

05:16.758 --> 05:20.011
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

05:20.053 --> 05:23.516
Feeling right at home
I'm feeling right at home

05:23.557 --> 05:26.894
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

05:26.936 --> 05:30.313
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

05:30.355 --> 05:32.607
He's kind of a showoff.

05:32.649 --> 05:36.653
You think he's cute?

05:47.539 --> 05:50.041
Roar!

05:50.333 --> 05:53.294
The King of New York City...

05:53.336 --> 05:56.714
...Alex the Lion!

05:56.756 --> 05:59.592
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

05:59.634 --> 06:01.593
The guy's an animal.

06:01.635 --> 06:05.597
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

06:05.639 --> 06:07.891
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

06:07.933 --> 06:11.521
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

06:11.563 --> 06:15.608
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

06:15.650 --> 06:18.819
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

06:18.861 --> 06:22.322
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

06:22.364 --> 06:25.492
He was a very bad kitty.

06:25.534 --> 06:28.287
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

06:28.328 --> 06:30.622
to have the animals sent to Africa,

06:30.664 --> 06:34.001
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

06:34.042 --> 06:36.211
was reported missing today.

06:36.253 --> 06:39.798
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

06:39.840 --> 06:42.509
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

06:42.551 --> 06:49.765
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

07:27.261 --> 07:29.096
I like to move it, move it

07:29.138 --> 07:31.098
He likes to move it, move it

07:31.140 --> 07:33.100
She likes to move it, move it

07:33.142 --> 07:35.811
- We like to
- Move it!

07:35.852 --> 07:40.524
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

07:40.565 --> 07:42.108
- We like to
- Move it!

07:42.150 --> 07:45.696
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

07:45.738 --> 07:48.199
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

07:48.241 --> 07:53.787
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

07:53.829 --> 07:56.289
Seriously though, call. OK?

07:56.331 --> 07:59.125
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

07:59.167 --> 08:01.419
You can't leave without this!

08:01.461 --> 08:04.297
Surprise, freaks!

08:04.339 --> 08:07.007
Shake it! Shake it.

08:07.049 --> 08:10.387
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

08:10.428 --> 08:14.891
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

08:14.933 --> 08:21.147
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

08:22.064 --> 08:28.112
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

08:28.154 --> 08:30.489
Oh, no, thank you.

08:30.531 --> 08:33.326
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

08:33.368 --> 08:38.289
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

08:38.330 --> 08:43.126
...Stevie will be in charge!

08:45.337 --> 08:48.299
I don't think they like that idea.

08:48.340 --> 08:51.719
What are you saying, Stevie?

08:51.760 --> 08:53.303
No.

08:53.344 --> 08:57.808
Could we...? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

08:57.850 --> 09:01.812
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

09:01.854 --> 09:03.814
Let them eat cake!

09:03.856 --> 09:06.817
King Julien, wait for me!

09:06.859 --> 09:10.487
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

09:10.528 --> 09:13.406
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

09:13.448 --> 09:15.492
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

09:15.533 --> 09:21.332
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

09:21.540 --> 09:25.710
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

09:25.752 --> 09:27.212
- Struts.
- Check.

09:27.253 --> 09:28.421
- Flaps.
- Check.

09:28.463 --> 09:30.423
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

09:30.465 --> 09:33.384
You guys!

09:35.845 --> 09:38.223
Oopsie-daisy!

09:38.264 --> 09:41.892
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

09:41.934 --> 09:44.312
But it'll have to do. Attention.

09:44.354 --> 09:45.897
This is your captain speaking.

09:45.939 --> 09:49.192
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

09:49.234 --> 09:51.319
then kiss your... good-bye.

09:51.361 --> 09:53.196
New York City, here we come!

09:53.238 --> 09:56.198
Pray to your personal God
this hunk ofjunk flies.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.992
Personal God, hunk...? What?

09:59.034 --> 10:00.786
We are go, sir.

10:00.828 --> 10:04.122
Open the door! I'm outside!

10:04.164 --> 10:05.999
If cabin pressure is lost,

10:06.041 --> 10:09.712
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

10:09.754 --> 10:13.924
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

10:13.966 --> 10:17.594
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

10:17.636 --> 10:18.887
Launch!

10:18.929 --> 10:22.850
- Launch!
- Launch!

11:01.345 --> 11:04.140
Gremlin!

11:05.933 --> 11:08.519
Hey, Mort.

11:08.561 --> 11:10.855
Hi!

11:13.732 --> 11:14.900
That was weird.

11:14.941 --> 11:18.320
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

11:18.361 --> 11:20.406
You got Madagascar on the brain.

11:20.448 --> 11:21.824
I know I'm gonna miss it.

11:21.866 --> 11:26.204
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

11:26.245 --> 11:27.996
Like when you bit me on the butt?

11:28.038 --> 11:32.501
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

11:32.542 --> 11:36.505
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

11:36.546 --> 11:40.592
Are the butts next to the croutons?

11:40.634 --> 11:42.511
You don't need to be sarcastic.

11:42.552 --> 11:47.015
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

11:47.057 --> 11:48.099
Breeding program?

11:48.141 --> 11:51.311
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

11:51.353 --> 11:53.814
Settle down, have a relationship.

11:53.855 --> 11:55.023
I can see that.

11:55.065 --> 11:58.401
What? Like dating?

11:58.443 --> 11:59.985
Yeah, dating.

12:00.027 --> 12:03.197
Other... other guys?

12:03.239 --> 12:08.119
What do you mean, other guys?

12:09.329 --> 12:11.289
Darn it!

12:11.331 --> 12:15.209
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

12:15.251 --> 12:17.503
I'm gonna go check.

12:17.545 --> 12:20.589
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

12:20.631 --> 12:23.717
It's so funny!

12:23.759 --> 12:27.596
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

12:27.638 --> 12:30.558
To laugh!

12:33.227 --> 12:35.813
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

12:35.855 --> 12:40.609
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

12:40.651 --> 12:43.112
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

12:43.154 --> 12:45.905
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

12:45.947 --> 12:48.700
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

12:48.741 --> 12:51.119
We were checking on our drink order.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.413
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

12:53.454 --> 12:55.791
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

12:55.833 --> 13:00.421
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

13:00.462 --> 13:03.590
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

13:03.631 --> 13:07.594
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

13:07.635 --> 13:11.097
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

13:11.139 --> 13:13.099
Skipper, look.

13:13.141 --> 13:14.309
Analysis.

13:14.350 --> 13:18.605
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

13:18.646 --> 13:20.815
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

13:20.857 --> 13:21.900
That too, sir.

13:21.941 --> 13:23.485
Right! Rico?

13:23.526 --> 13:26.237
Manual!

13:26.863 --> 13:28.406
Problemo solved.

13:28.448 --> 13:30.992
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

13:31.034 --> 13:34.119
We've lost engine one...

13:34.161 --> 13:36.497
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

13:36.538 --> 13:38.582
Buckle up, boys.

13:38.624 --> 13:40.918
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.505
Attention! This is your captain.

13:43.546 --> 13:47.300
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

13:47.342 --> 13:52.387
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

13:52.429 --> 13:56.308
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

13:56.350 --> 14:01.939
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

14:09.863 --> 14:17.496
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

14:17.538 --> 14:19.081
I can fly!

14:19.122 --> 14:23.793
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

14:23.835 --> 14:27.088
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

14:27.129 --> 14:30.592
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

14:30.634 --> 14:32.511
I broke your iPod!

14:32.553 --> 14:35.221
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

14:35.263 --> 14:37.807
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

14:37.849 --> 14:39.684
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

14:39.725 --> 14:41.519
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

14:41.561 --> 14:46.941
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

14:51.528 --> 14:58.911
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

15:07.752 --> 15:10.505
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

15:10.547 --> 15:12.507
Rico, you've had your fun.

15:12.549 --> 15:15.343
Pull up.

15:16.136 --> 15:18.890
Gear down.

15:18.931 --> 15:21.517
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

15:21.559 --> 15:26.313
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

15:26.354 --> 15:29.941
I said, kiss it!

15:32.527 --> 15:35.780
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

15:35.822 --> 15:40.534
I believe that's checkmate.

15:45.457 --> 15:52.964
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

16:05.143 --> 16:07.604
Oh, we're here.

16:07.646 --> 16:11.106
What in the world?

16:11.148 --> 16:14.610
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

16:14.652 --> 16:17.112
I'm OK. I'm alive.

16:17.154 --> 16:21.200
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

16:21.242 --> 16:23.410
Kowalski, casualty report.

16:23.452 --> 16:25.578
Two passengers unaccounted for.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.582
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

16:28.624 --> 16:31.418
Who says a penguin can't fly?

16:31.460 --> 16:36.298
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

16:36.340 --> 16:38.801
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

16:38.843 --> 16:42.011
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

16:42.053 --> 16:45.807
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

16:45.849 --> 16:48.810
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

16:48.852 --> 16:51.688
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

16:51.729 --> 16:56.109
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

16:56.151 --> 16:57.819
How do you estimate that?

16:57.861 --> 17:01.281
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

17:01.322 --> 17:04.492
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

17:04.534 --> 17:08.997
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

17:09.038 --> 17:11.415
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

17:11.455 --> 17:13.709
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.502
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

17:15.544 --> 17:18.298
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

17:18.339 --> 17:21.217
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

17:21.259 --> 17:25.512
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

17:25.555 --> 17:27.513
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

17:27.556 --> 17:30.893
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

17:30.934 --> 17:34.897
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

17:34.938 --> 17:38.400
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

17:38.442 --> 17:41.404
You know, grit and spit and spit.

17:41.446 --> 17:44.406
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

17:44.448 --> 17:46.700
That don't sound too promising.

17:46.742 --> 17:49.286
You're right. We're stuck here.

17:49.328 --> 17:53.415
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

17:53.457 --> 17:56.710
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

17:56.752 --> 17:59.212
Behold! The lion!

17:59.253 --> 18:01.798
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

18:01.839 --> 18:06.178
Wait, wait, wait! People!

18:06.220 --> 18:08.388
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

18:08.430 --> 18:11.892
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

18:11.934 --> 18:14.894
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

18:14.936 --> 18:17.188
I know you!

18:17.230 --> 18:18.397
You.

18:18.439 --> 18:22.360
It's the bad kitty.

18:28.826 --> 18:33.830
How do you like some of that?!

18:49.928 --> 18:53.432
Come in, Tokyo!

18:58.521 --> 19:00.106
Right in the batteries.

19:00.148 --> 19:03.108
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

19:03.150 --> 19:06.903
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

19:06.945 --> 19:08.780
Thank you, dear.

19:08.822 --> 19:11.825
Moving on!

19:12.325 --> 19:16.913
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

19:16.955 --> 19:19.291
Out of my mind?

19:19.332 --> 19:21.877
Who's out of my mind now?

19:21.918 --> 19:24.296
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

19:24.337 --> 19:29.634
Out of my mind. We're going home.

19:38.726 --> 19:40.604
Message E-4.

19:40.645 --> 19:44.483
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

19:44.524 --> 19:48.819
Please try again later.

19:51.530 --> 19:53.491
Am I trippin'?

19:53.532 --> 19:57.286
All those zebras... like me.

19:57.328 --> 20:00.289
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

20:00.331 --> 20:03.000
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

20:03.042 --> 20:05.586
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

20:05.628 --> 20:06.879
Africa?

20:06.921 --> 20:08.506
It's got to be.

20:08.547 --> 20:11.300
Our ancestral crib.

20:11.342 --> 20:13.677
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

20:13.719 --> 20:16.555
No, it's more than that. It's like...

20:16.597 --> 20:19.641
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

20:19.682 --> 20:21.518
It's like Roots!

20:21.559 --> 20:23.228
No, it's like...

20:23.269 --> 20:27.441
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

20:27.483 --> 20:29.902
How!

20:31.570 --> 20:33.988
How!

20:36.783 --> 20:38.743
Me Alex!

20:38.785 --> 20:42.247
Me and me friends fly,

20:42.288 --> 20:46.668
fly in great metal bird.

20:46.793 --> 20:49.920
Then plummet!

20:49.962 --> 20:52.048
Smash ground!

20:52.090 --> 20:54.634
Go boom!

20:54.676 --> 20:58.429
Then here we emerge.

20:58.471 --> 21:01.558
We offer only happiness

21:01.599 --> 21:03.935
and good greetings.

21:03.977 --> 21:07.229
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

21:07.271 --> 21:09.439
Yeah. We just... yeah.

21:09.481 --> 21:11.233
I thought... Sorry.

21:11.275 --> 21:13.652
You came from off the reserve?

21:13.694 --> 21:20.201
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

21:24.371 --> 21:26.039
Don't strain yourself.

21:26.081 --> 21:28.333
What's going on here?

21:28.375 --> 21:31.128
They say they're from off the reserve.

21:31.170 --> 21:34.548
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.841
You look familiar. Do I know you?

21:36.883 --> 21:39.428
How could you survive the hunters?

21:39.470 --> 21:41.847
We didn't see any hunters.

21:41.889 --> 21:43.724
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

21:43.765 --> 21:47.144
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

21:47.186 --> 21:49.730
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

21:49.771 --> 21:52.148
Is there a manager we could talk to?

21:52.190 --> 21:55.318
I see. You're here to challenge me!

21:55.359 --> 21:57.028
What? No! No.

21:57.069 --> 21:59.030
That's what it looks like to me!

21:59.071 --> 22:00.656
Zuba! Wait.

22:00.698 --> 22:02.451
I'm trying to take care of business...

22:02.493 --> 22:05.746
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

22:05.788 --> 22:07.830
Alakay?

22:07.872 --> 22:09.457
Is that you?

22:09.499 --> 22:13.044
No, it's Alex. Lx. Like New York Knicks.

22:13.085 --> 22:15.129
Zuba, look!

22:15.171 --> 22:18.549
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

22:18.591 --> 22:20.635
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

22:20.676 --> 22:23.220
A mark.

22:23.261 --> 22:26.432
All right, this is a little weird.

22:26.474 --> 22:29.435
Honey, he's come home.

22:29.477 --> 22:31.229
What?

22:31.270 --> 22:34.982
You've come home.

22:41.363 --> 22:43.782
Son.

22:48.787 --> 22:51.207
Dad.

22:51.958 --> 22:54.918
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

22:54.960 --> 22:59.131
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

22:59.172 --> 23:01.049
I got a mom and dad!

23:01.091 --> 23:02.634
My baby's alive!

23:02.676 --> 23:04.219
Dad!

23:04.261 --> 23:06.555
My son!

23:06.596 --> 23:10.099
My son is home!

23:11.183 --> 23:16.064
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

23:18.066 --> 23:23.155
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

23:23.196 --> 23:25.739
I thought you hated Zuba.

23:25.781 --> 23:30.119
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

23:30.161 --> 23:32.746
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

23:32.788 --> 23:36.542
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

23:36.584 --> 23:38.128
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

23:38.170 --> 23:41.131
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

23:41.173 --> 23:43.132
New York!

23:43.174 --> 23:47.136
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

23:47.178 --> 23:50.431
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

23:50.473 --> 23:52.725
This calls for a celebration!

23:52.766 --> 23:54.727
Maurice, I think they like me.

23:54.768 --> 23:59.147
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

23:59.189 --> 24:03.110
Chukka-chukka what?

24:07.072 --> 24:12.036
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

24:12.077 --> 24:15.163
Hey, Marty!

24:16.456 --> 24:20.543
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

24:20.585 --> 24:23.338
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.841
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

24:25.883 --> 24:28.927
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.429
What? You don't have doctors here?

24:31.471 --> 24:33.014
Not anymore.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.517
Well, what if you catch a cold?

24:35.558 --> 24:41.147
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.441
You guys really need a doctor.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.735
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

24:46.777 --> 24:50.073
Me? A doctor?

24:53.785 --> 24:57.539
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

24:57.580 --> 25:00.749
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

25:00.791 --> 25:03.252
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

25:03.293 --> 25:06.421
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.633
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

25:09.675 --> 25:15.639
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

25:15.681 --> 25:18.433
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.436
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.147
Roar!

25:23.188 --> 25:27.234
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

25:27.276 --> 25:34.574
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

25:35.868 --> 25:37.744
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

25:37.786 --> 25:41.123
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

25:41.165 --> 25:46.335
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!

25:46.377 --> 25:47.920
How do I look?

25:47.962 --> 25:53.134
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

25:53.176 --> 25:56.053
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

25:56.095 --> 25:58.639
Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

25:58.681 --> 26:03.394
My mother will be so happy.

26:04.896 --> 26:10.693
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

26:11.486 --> 26:14.906
Here he comes.

26:16.073 --> 26:17.824
I like 'em big

26:17.866 --> 26:20.118
I like 'em chunky

26:20.160 --> 26:24.040
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy

26:24.081 --> 26:27.752
I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'

26:27.794 --> 26:31.047
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

26:31.088 --> 26:33.632
Goodness, girl... you huge.

26:33.673 --> 26:37.219
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

26:37.260 --> 26:39.429
You as quick as you are hefty.

26:39.471 --> 26:41.932
So you're Moto Moto?

26:41.973 --> 26:44.351
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

26:44.392 --> 26:46.144
I kind of like it, fatso.

26:46.186 --> 26:55.195
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

26:57.656 --> 27:00.158
Oops!

27:00.784 --> 27:03.328
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

27:03.370 --> 27:07.832
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

27:07.873 --> 27:11.128
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

27:11.169 --> 27:13.839
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

27:13.880 --> 27:16.049
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

27:16.091 --> 27:21.512
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

27:21.554 --> 27:23.848
I forgot about the rite of passage.

27:23.889 --> 27:26.225
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

27:26.267 --> 27:29.019
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

27:29.061 --> 27:32.648
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

27:32.690 --> 27:36.444
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

27:36.485 --> 27:39.613
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

27:39.655 --> 27:43.534
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

27:43.576 --> 27:45.327
I want to be Alaki.

27:45.369 --> 27:47.746
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

27:47.788 --> 27:50.416
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

27:50.458 --> 27:53.251
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

27:53.293 --> 27:55.545
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

27:55.587 --> 27:59.008
That's my boy!

28:04.180 --> 28:06.931
I'm a private dancer

28:06.973 --> 28:10.768
A dancer for money

28:16.858 --> 28:20.945
Any old music will do

28:22.280 --> 28:24.115
Beautiful, isn't it?

28:24.157 --> 28:27.035
It's amazing.

28:27.076 --> 28:29.037
Guys...

28:29.078 --> 28:32.832
...this is where we belong.

28:32.874 --> 28:35.418
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.337
Oh, I like that one.

28:37.378 --> 28:39.129
It works on many levels.

28:39.171 --> 28:41.048
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

28:41.089 --> 28:42.549
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

28:42.591 --> 28:44.426
Stations.

28:44.468 --> 28:47.889
Stage one. Go!

29:00.567 --> 29:03.237
Oh, no! What have I done?

29:03.278 --> 29:04.613
Come on, take the bait.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.324
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

29:07.366 --> 29:10.119
Is it dead?

29:10.160 --> 29:14.373
Stage two! Go, go, go!

29:19.753 --> 29:24.049
I will give him the kiss of life.

29:24.091 --> 29:26.592
Rico!

29:28.386 --> 29:30.888
Rico!

29:32.390 --> 29:33.725
Reverse!

29:33.767 --> 29:34.852
Gas!

29:34.893 --> 29:37.437
Music!

29:37.479 --> 29:40.982
No! Stop! Stop!

29:41.065 --> 29:42.650
Stop!

29:42.692 --> 29:45.695
Come back!

29:46.070 --> 29:51.784
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

29:54.787 --> 29:56.830
Is she dead?

29:56.872 --> 29:59.167
No!

30:06.090 --> 30:09.385
You hoodlums!

30:09.969 --> 30:11.845
Good heavens! Are you OK?

30:11.887 --> 30:15.140
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

30:15.182 --> 30:18.935
My handbag. Such a good boy.

30:18.977 --> 30:21.314
Nana can't survive without it.

30:21.355 --> 30:23.524
You are one tough cookie.

30:23.566 --> 30:26.444
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

30:26.486 --> 30:30.322
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

30:30.363 --> 30:34.034
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...

30:34.075 --> 30:36.036
Where are you going?

30:36.077 --> 30:41.917
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

30:41.958 --> 30:45.837
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

30:45.879 --> 30:48.840
Please! We need to stay...

30:48.882 --> 30:51.218
...together.

30:51.259 --> 30:53.637
Fine! We'll go that way!

30:53.678 --> 30:58.682
Does anyone want a hard candy?

30:59.975 --> 31:02.812
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

31:02.853 --> 31:08.442
And right here... OK, are you ready?

31:08.651 --> 31:10.946
This is where you always slept.

31:10.987 --> 31:13.781
Oh, man!

31:16.575 --> 31:20.746
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

31:20.788 --> 31:23.916
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

31:23.958 --> 31:27.336
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

31:27.378 --> 31:28.546
A little harder than...

31:28.587 --> 31:33.134
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

31:33.175 --> 31:34.635
Is that...?

31:34.677 --> 31:37.930
Is that my...?

31:37.972 --> 31:39.849
Is that me?

31:39.890 --> 31:42.309
You had the cutest little paws.

31:42.351 --> 31:45.019
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

31:45.061 --> 31:49.023
You did that the day we lost you.

31:49.065 --> 31:52.318
Wow. I was so young.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.612
What happened to me?

31:54.654 --> 31:58.242
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

31:58.284 --> 32:00.535
It was not your fault.

32:00.577 --> 32:05.832
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

32:05.874 --> 32:07.417
Far off the reserve.

32:07.459 --> 32:11.045
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

32:11.087 --> 32:12.338
...well...

32:12.380 --> 32:16.009
We thought they'd killed you.

32:16.050 --> 32:20.638
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

32:20.680 --> 32:22.348
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

32:22.390 --> 32:28.021
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

32:28.062 --> 32:30.940
You used to call this "foofie."

32:30.982 --> 32:33.233
"Foofie"?

32:33.275 --> 32:34.735
Foofie.

32:34.777 --> 32:36.320
He doesn't want that.

32:36.361 --> 32:40.157
This is my foofie!

32:40.866 --> 32:42.910
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

32:42.951 --> 32:47.539
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

32:47.581 --> 32:51.210
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

32:51.251 --> 32:53.545
You'll need all your strength.

32:53.587 --> 32:56.423
I will bring the house down for you.

32:56.465 --> 33:00.636
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

33:00.677 --> 33:02.346
Jeez, Mom, really?

33:02.387 --> 33:06.933
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

33:06.974 --> 33:10.729
You were born with it.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.648
Good night, Alakay.

33:12.689 --> 33:16.610
My boy. My own boy.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.738
My son's a king.

33:20.780 --> 33:24.367
My son's a king.

33:32.751 --> 33:35.336
Good night, Mom.

33:35.378 --> 33:39.298
Good night, Alakay.

33:43.970 --> 33:45.930
Foofie.

33:45.972 --> 33:49.933
Look at foofie! My foofie!

33:49.975 --> 33:53.311
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

33:53.353 --> 33:58.443
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

33:58.484 --> 34:00.736
I think we're lost.

34:00.778 --> 34:03.448
Nana, do you know where you're going?

34:03.489 --> 34:08.118
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

34:08.159 --> 34:12.831
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

34:12.873 --> 34:15.708
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

34:15.750 --> 34:18.420
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

34:18.462 --> 34:23.216
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

34:23.257 --> 34:26.011
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?

34:26.052 --> 34:27.429
How will we all survive?

34:27.471 --> 34:33.518
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

34:33.560 --> 34:36.520
You can let nature
get the best of you,

34:36.562 --> 34:41.442
or you can get the best of nature.

34:41.484 --> 34:45.322
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

34:45.362 --> 34:46.614
Yeah.

34:46.656 --> 34:50.118
We survive the concrete jungle!

34:50.159 --> 34:53.621
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

34:53.661 --> 34:55.414
- Am I right?
- She's right.

34:55.456 --> 34:58.918
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

34:58.959 --> 35:03.422
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

35:03.464 --> 35:05.716
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

35:05.758 --> 35:08.219
If we can make it there,

35:08.260 --> 35:12.640
we can make it anywhere!

35:26.986 --> 35:31.367
I'm coming, King Julien!

35:35.579 --> 35:39.624
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

35:39.666 --> 35:43.586
No, shark, no! Sit!

35:44.254 --> 35:48.049
Why am I laughing?

35:49.676 --> 35:54.139
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

35:54.180 --> 35:56.516
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

35:56.558 --> 36:00.228
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

36:00.270 --> 36:02.605
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

36:02.647 --> 36:04.732
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

36:04.774 --> 36:06.609
Darn you, Darwin!

36:06.651 --> 36:12.322
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

36:12.364 --> 36:15.325
Rico! You're coming with me!

36:15.367 --> 36:19.330
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

36:19.372 --> 36:26.587
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

36:29.465 --> 36:31.633
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

36:31.675 --> 36:35.387
Oh, I doubt that.

36:39.975 --> 36:42.311
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

36:42.352 --> 36:46.440
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

36:46.482 --> 36:50.611
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

36:50.652 --> 36:52.321
Any questions?

36:52.362 --> 36:56.742
Good! Let's get to work.

37:02.163 --> 37:05.333
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

37:05.374 --> 37:10.881
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

37:15.051 --> 37:20.306
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

37:20.348 --> 37:24.727
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

37:24.769 --> 37:25.812
Sure, mister.

37:25.853 --> 37:29.941
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

37:29.982 --> 37:33.528
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

37:33.569 --> 37:37.323
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

37:37.365 --> 37:40.743
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

37:40.785 --> 37:43.037
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

37:43.079 --> 37:45.539
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

37:45.580 --> 37:50.210
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

37:50.252 --> 37:52.629
Well, I wish I could help,

37:52.671 --> 37:56.426
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

37:56.467 --> 38:00.720
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

38:00.762 --> 38:04.224
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

38:04.266 --> 38:06.017
Makunga, right? Thank you.

38:06.059 --> 38:08.728
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

38:08.770 --> 38:10.730
Shake it out.

38:10.772 --> 38:12.941
A five, six, seven, eight.

38:12.983 --> 38:17.362
Let's go, let's do this.

38:33.669 --> 38:36.130
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

38:36.172 --> 38:39.508
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

38:39.550 --> 38:40.843
On it, Mom!

38:40.886 --> 38:42.637
Who will be the first participant?

38:42.679 --> 38:45.640
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

38:45.682 --> 38:48.142
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

38:48.184 --> 38:50.603
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

38:50.644 --> 38:53.439
Let me see.

38:53.481 --> 38:57.485
I guess I'll pick...

38:59.069 --> 39:02.030
...Teetsi?

39:02.071 --> 39:04.825
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

39:04.867 --> 39:08.913
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

39:08.954 --> 39:13.167
Somebody, wake him up!

39:24.469 --> 39:27.305
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

39:27.347 --> 39:32.144
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

39:32.186 --> 39:34.104
- Let's dance!
- OK.

39:34.145 --> 39:37.107
But let me warn you
that I am a protégé of...

39:37.148 --> 39:40.110
...Fosse and Robbins!

39:40.151 --> 39:43.530
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

39:43.571 --> 39:47.951
Dance fight! You got it.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.541
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

39:54.582 --> 39:57.544
I know that boy is not dancing.

39:57.585 --> 40:02.507
This is even better than I thought.

40:02.549 --> 40:04.258
Alakay, turn around!

40:04.299 --> 40:12.683
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

40:18.314 --> 40:21.024
Oh, no.

40:21.108 --> 40:23.569
Alakay! Are you hurt?

40:23.610 --> 40:25.446
Yeah, I am.

40:25.487 --> 40:27.364
Did I... did I win?

40:27.406 --> 40:28.782
No, son.

40:28.824 --> 40:30.868
How could this happen?

40:30.909 --> 40:35.080
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

40:35.122 --> 40:39.584
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

40:39.625 --> 40:43.672
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

40:43.714 --> 40:44.882
Perform?

40:44.923 --> 40:49.762
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

40:49.803 --> 40:55.057
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

40:55.099 --> 40:56.768
...his own son?

40:56.809 --> 40:58.978
Zuba, no.

40:59.020 --> 41:01.063
Zuba, yes.

41:01.105 --> 41:07.987
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

41:17.705 --> 41:21.167
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

41:21.209 --> 41:23.168
Dad, what are you doing?

41:23.210 --> 41:27.924
Dad, no! You can't do this.

41:28.299 --> 41:31.761
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

41:31.803 --> 41:33.262
Anyone?

41:33.304 --> 41:36.057
Someone? No one?

41:36.099 --> 41:37.683
You, sir!

41:37.725 --> 41:39.267
I guess not.

41:39.309 --> 41:42.646
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

41:42.687 --> 41:47.859
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

41:47.901 --> 41:51.864
Teetsi! Get the hat.

41:51.906 --> 41:55.951
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

41:55.992 --> 41:58.245
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

41:58.286 --> 42:01.373
...and leave the watering hole

42:01.414 --> 42:05.168
for a thousand years, or life!

42:05.210 --> 42:09.296
Whichever comes last.

42:09.797 --> 42:12.967
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

42:13.008 --> 42:17.472
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

42:17.514 --> 42:19.850
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

42:19.891 --> 42:21.268
What did you expect?!

42:21.309 --> 42:25.855
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

42:25.896 --> 42:28.774
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

42:28.816 --> 42:30.776
No, I guess not. You dance!

42:30.818 --> 42:34.864
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

42:34.905 --> 42:37.658
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

42:37.700 --> 42:41.162
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

42:41.203 --> 42:43.873
A real lion.

42:43.914 --> 42:46.625
Thanks.

42:48.586 --> 42:51.881
Thanks a lot.

43:00.013 --> 43:02.432
Saw.

43:02.599 --> 43:05.311
Suture.

43:05.811 --> 43:07.354
Swab.

43:07.396 --> 43:08.856
You're in my light, Stephen.

43:08.898 --> 43:11.775
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

43:11.816 --> 43:16.571
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

43:16.613 --> 43:20.366
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

43:20.408 --> 43:22.660
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

43:22.702 --> 43:25.079
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

43:25.121 --> 43:27.582
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

43:27.624 --> 43:31.461
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

43:31.503 --> 43:34.964
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

43:35.006 --> 43:40.553
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

43:40.595 --> 43:44.640
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

43:44.681 --> 43:45.974
This won't hurt a bit.

43:46.016 --> 43:50.271
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spot just like that.

43:50.313 --> 43:55.151
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

43:55.193 --> 43:56.653
Wednesday, no Joe?

43:56.694 --> 43:59.279
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

43:59.321 --> 44:03.575
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

44:03.617 --> 44:07.162
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

44:07.204 --> 44:09.248
But I've never heard of it.

44:09.289 --> 44:12.668
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

44:12.709 --> 44:15.170
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

44:15.212 --> 44:21.802
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

44:29.184 --> 44:30.476
Ta-da!

44:30.518 --> 44:33.146
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

44:33.187 --> 44:34.772
Hollah!

44:34.814 --> 44:38.944
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

44:38.986 --> 44:41.363
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

44:41.405 --> 44:43.740
Well, you can try all you want to,

44:43.782 --> 44:45.867
but it takes years of practice.

44:45.908 --> 44:47.952
You'll never get a tight stream

44:47.994 --> 44:52.540
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

44:52.582 --> 44:58.379
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

45:08.598 --> 45:11.184
Ta-da!

45:13.603 --> 45:16.855
How did you...? You guys got it
right out of the box!

45:16.897 --> 45:18.648
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

45:18.690 --> 45:20.150
It's in our blood!

45:20.192 --> 45:22.944
I always thought I was a bit unique.

45:22.986 --> 45:24.446
We are unique!

45:24.488 --> 45:26.574
We are like a force of nature!

45:26.616 --> 45:29.243
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

45:29.285 --> 45:32.370
Exactly the same!

45:32.412 --> 45:36.124
Exactly the same.

45:36.291 --> 45:40.253
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

45:40.295 --> 45:45.842
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

45:45.884 --> 45:48.385
Nice.

45:59.397 --> 46:03.651
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

46:03.692 --> 46:05.653
I've ruined my parents' lives.

46:05.694 --> 46:07.655
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

46:07.696 --> 46:12.576
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

46:12.618 --> 46:14.746
So...

46:14.788 --> 46:18.458
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.459
Hey, guys.

46:20.501 --> 46:22.670
Is this place great or what?!

46:22.711 --> 46:24.463
I'd go with "or what."

46:24.505 --> 46:28.551
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

46:28.592 --> 46:31.971
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

46:32.012 --> 46:33.472
Who's Moto Moto?

46:33.514 --> 46:37.476
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

46:37.518 --> 46:39.979
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

46:40.020 --> 46:41.939
It means, "Hot Hot."

46:41.981 --> 46:43.274
"Hot Hot"?

46:43.315 --> 46:46.277
When did you start parlez-ing African?

46:46.318 --> 46:47.445
It's in my blood.

46:47.486 --> 46:51.156
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

46:51.197 --> 46:54.075
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

46:54.117 --> 46:56.369
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

46:56.411 --> 46:59.164
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

46:59.205 --> 47:00.666
Whoa, guys.

47:00.708 --> 47:02.251
Main Street's mine!

47:02.293 --> 47:04.462
Well, you can have it!

47:04.503 --> 47:08.840
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

47:08.882 --> 47:11.176
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

47:11.217 --> 47:12.761
Melman, just tell her.

47:12.802 --> 47:16.639
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

47:16.681 --> 47:18.141
I guess I'll go, then.

47:18.183 --> 47:19.642
Don't bother.

47:19.684 --> 47:23.353
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

47:23.395 --> 47:27.776
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

47:27.817 --> 47:29.652
- Marty?
- Marty?

47:29.694 --> 47:31.654
Marty?

47:31.696 --> 47:33.573
What the heck is going on?

47:33.615 --> 47:38.660
You're not...? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

47:38.702 --> 47:41.455
You thought that guy...

47:41.497 --> 47:42.873
...was me?

47:42.915 --> 47:45.667
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

47:45.709 --> 47:48.171
You thought I was him?

47:48.213 --> 47:50.256
You guys kind of do look a little...

47:50.298 --> 47:52.966
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

47:53.008 --> 47:56.970
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

47:57.012 --> 48:00.057
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

48:00.099 --> 48:03.477
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

48:03.519 --> 48:05.562
I'm just like any other zebra.

48:05.604 --> 48:07.564
No. Of course you're different!

48:07.606 --> 48:10.024
How?

48:10.608 --> 48:13.070
OK, I can't tell you apart.

48:13.112 --> 48:15.864
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

48:15.906 --> 48:18.867
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

48:18.909 --> 48:21.745
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

48:21.787 --> 48:24.539
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

48:24.580 --> 48:28.167
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

48:28.209 --> 48:32.755
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

48:32.797 --> 48:35.341
It's always about you, isn't it?

48:35.383 --> 48:38.762
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

48:38.804 --> 48:42.265
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

48:42.306 --> 48:45.143
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

48:45.184 --> 48:48.438
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

48:48.479 --> 48:53.943
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

48:53.985 --> 48:57.362
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

48:57.404 --> 49:00.241
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

49:00.283 --> 49:03.953
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

49:03.995 --> 49:07.165
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

49:07.206 --> 49:10.250
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

49:10.292 --> 49:14.504
Nice hat, you showoff!

49:18.508 --> 49:20.761
Marty...

49:20.802 --> 49:22.554
...don't go.

49:22.596 --> 49:26.516
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

49:27.309 --> 49:28.852
Look, Maurice!

49:28.894 --> 49:31.438
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

49:31.480 --> 49:36.359
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

49:36.401 --> 49:39.946
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

49:39.988 --> 49:43.240
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

49:43.282 --> 49:46.535
I'm terminal, you know?

49:46.577 --> 49:50.248
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

49:50.290 --> 49:52.751
That's a bummer, man.

49:52.793 --> 49:55.754
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

49:55.796 --> 49:58.255
...only had two days left to live,

49:58.297 --> 49:59.757
I would do all the things

49:59.799 --> 50:02.343
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

50:02.384 --> 50:05.471
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

50:05.513 --> 50:09.850
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

50:09.892 --> 50:14.396
make my living out of it.

50:20.194 --> 50:25.449
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

50:25.491 --> 50:29.452
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

50:29.494 --> 50:31.663
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

50:31.704 --> 50:35.876
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

50:35.918 --> 50:39.839
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

50:39.880 --> 50:43.843
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

50:43.883 --> 50:46.970
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

50:47.011 --> 50:49.556
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

50:49.597 --> 50:51.558
What is it? Please tell me!

50:51.599 --> 50:55.353
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

50:55.395 --> 50:57.063
How I've always felt about her.

50:57.105 --> 51:00.066
Fine. Don't tell me!

51:00.108 --> 51:04.154
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

51:04.195 --> 51:08.867
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

51:08.908 --> 51:10.869
Yeah. Yeah.

51:10.910 --> 51:12.871
You're right.

51:12.912 --> 51:16.248
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

51:16.290 --> 51:19.835
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

51:19.877 --> 51:22.756
Just a little, or almost all the way.

51:22.797 --> 51:26.760
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

51:26.801 --> 51:30.263
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

51:30.305 --> 51:34.266
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

51:34.308 --> 51:38.562
Actually, it's more like love her.

51:38.604 --> 51:41.774
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

51:41.815 --> 51:45.360
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

51:45.402 --> 51:48.238
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

51:48.280 --> 51:50.365
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

51:50.407 --> 51:53.368
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

51:53.410 --> 51:56.538
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

51:56.580 --> 51:58.665
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

51:58.707 --> 52:02.335
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

52:02.376 --> 52:03.753
Do you feel it?

52:03.795 --> 52:06.464
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

52:06.506 --> 52:11.553
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

52:11.595 --> 52:14.973
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

52:15.015 --> 52:17.850
I love that happy little head.

52:17.892 --> 52:19.644
She love

52:19.685 --> 52:22.063
Moto Moto

52:22.105 --> 52:23.773
She love

52:23.815 --> 52:25.358
Moto Moto

52:25.400 --> 52:29.445
She loves me
She loves my eyes

52:29.487 --> 52:33.156
She loves me
She loves my thighs

52:33.198 --> 52:35.243
She loves my roundness

52:35.284 --> 52:39.455
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

52:39.497 --> 52:43.668
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

52:43.709 --> 52:47.755
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

52:47.797 --> 52:49.673
She love me...

52:49.714 --> 52:51.466
...'cause she love me

52:51.508 --> 52:53.343
Moto Moto...

52:53.385 --> 52:56.847
...before things get too serious, well,

52:56.888 --> 53:01.144
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

53:01.185 --> 53:02.854
...I'd like to ask you...

53:02.895 --> 53:07.774
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

53:07.816 --> 53:09.860
I have so many questions.

53:09.901 --> 53:13.363
I promise the answer will always be yes.

53:13.405 --> 53:16.074
Unless no is required.

53:16.116 --> 53:21.036
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

53:21.078 --> 53:23.957
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

53:23.999 --> 53:26.042
OK. Other than that.

53:26.084 --> 53:27.753
Let's see.

53:27.794 --> 53:31.673
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

53:31.715 --> 53:34.301
Right.

53:35.093 --> 53:37.636
My gosh, girl, you huge.

53:37.678 --> 53:38.846
You said that.

53:38.888 --> 53:41.640
Yeah, that's right.

53:41.682 --> 53:43.768
We don't have to talk no more.

53:43.809 --> 53:46.146
Gloria!

53:46.188 --> 53:47.564
Gloria.

53:47.606 --> 53:50.150
Melman.

53:50.192 --> 53:55.571
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

53:55.613 --> 54:00.034
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

54:00.076 --> 54:03.746
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

54:03.788 --> 54:05.372
Apology accepted.

54:05.414 --> 54:11.045
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

54:11.087 --> 54:13.547
OK. Well, that's it, then.

54:13.589 --> 54:17.051
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

54:17.093 --> 54:21.055
No. No, that's not it.

54:21.097 --> 54:24.557
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

54:24.599 --> 54:28.144
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

54:28.186 --> 54:30.772
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

54:30.814 --> 54:34.568
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers. OK?

54:34.610 --> 54:38.571
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

54:38.613 --> 54:41.032
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

54:41.074 --> 54:42.951
No crust, the way she likes it.

54:42.992 --> 54:46.454
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

54:46.496 --> 54:50.041
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

54:50.083 --> 54:55.170
She has the most amazing laugh.

54:57.090 --> 55:00.468
That's what I would do if I were you.

55:00.510 --> 55:04.055
But I'm not, so you do it.

55:04.097 --> 55:06.391
OK.

55:06.808 --> 55:08.768
What?

55:08.810 --> 55:12.271
That was beautiful.

55:12.312 --> 55:15.649
Anyways, where were we?

55:15.691 --> 55:18.736
I'm "huge"?

55:18.777 --> 55:20.447
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

55:20.488 --> 55:23.742
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

55:23.783 --> 55:28.162
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

55:28.203 --> 55:32.249
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

55:32.291 --> 55:37.379
And making me look like a fool!

55:51.894 --> 55:54.855
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

55:54.897 --> 55:57.607
Coward.

56:07.408 --> 56:09.953
The water. It's gone.

56:09.995 --> 56:11.954
It's never gone dry before.

56:11.996 --> 56:14.832
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

56:14.874 --> 56:18.169
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

56:18.211 --> 56:21.172
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

56:21.214 --> 56:23.549
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

56:23.591 --> 56:25.051
Makunga, what do we do?

56:25.093 --> 56:27.053
Quiet!

56:27.095 --> 56:33.059
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

56:33.101 --> 56:34.852
We'll all have to fight for it.

56:34.894 --> 56:38.856
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

56:38.898 --> 56:40.566
That's not fair. You'd win!

56:40.608 --> 56:42.068
Exactly, Shirley.

56:42.110 --> 56:43.568
I'm Bob...

56:43.610 --> 56:47.239
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

56:47.280 --> 56:50.450
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

56:50.492 --> 56:54.037
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

56:54.079 --> 56:58.333
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

56:58.375 --> 57:00.752
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

57:00.794 --> 57:02.254
Hunters would shoot us!

57:02.295 --> 57:04.256
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

57:04.297 --> 57:06.550
I left the reserve!

57:06.591 --> 57:09.553
And survived.

57:09.594 --> 57:11.555
I can do something about this.

57:11.596 --> 57:15.933
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

57:15.975 --> 57:18.144
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

57:18.185 --> 57:20.230
You?

57:20.272 --> 57:23.442
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

57:23.483 --> 57:29.530
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

57:29.572 --> 57:34.869
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

57:34.910 --> 57:41.000
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

57:43.378 --> 57:44.963
Zuba would know what to do.

57:45.005 --> 57:46.964
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

57:47.006 --> 57:52.386
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.639
All right, fine!

57:55.681 --> 58:02.270
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

58:05.690 --> 58:08.277
Marty?

58:15.993 --> 58:19.079
Hey! Marty!

58:22.707 --> 58:25.293
Marty?

58:27.003 --> 58:28.755
Marty.

58:28.797 --> 58:30.633
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

58:30.674 --> 58:33.134
Excuse me! Excuse me!

58:33.176 --> 58:36.846
Hi. Is Marty in there?

58:36.888 --> 58:40.683
Anyone seen Marty?

58:41.309 --> 58:43.645
Which one of us is Marty?

58:43.686 --> 58:46.356
All right. Well, if you see him,

58:46.398 --> 58:48.857
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

58:48.899 --> 58:51.735
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

58:51.777 --> 58:55.156
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

58:55.198 --> 58:59.994
You can't leave the reserve!

59:08.794 --> 59:10.337
What are you doing?

59:10.379 --> 59:13.549
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

59:13.590 --> 59:15.050
Could you leave the hat?

59:15.092 --> 59:17.845
Marty! I know you're in there.

59:17.886 --> 59:21.849
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

59:21.890 --> 59:24.143
You've been a great friend.

59:24.184 --> 59:27.730
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

59:27.771 --> 59:31.066
that I never think of you having any.

59:31.108 --> 59:34.069
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

59:34.111 --> 59:36.738
Just like back at the zoo.

59:36.779 --> 59:41.868
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

59:41.909 --> 59:44.538
I just want you to know that I...

59:44.580 --> 59:46.832
You're one in a million.

59:46.874 --> 59:48.751
This is touching.

59:48.792 --> 59:50.543
It is touching.

59:50.585 --> 59:54.797
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

59:54.839 --> 59:57.091
That's right. Gotcha!

59:57.133 --> 59:59.802
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

59:59.844 --> 01:00:01.804
You, right there.

01:00:01.846 --> 01:00:06.100
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

01:00:06.142 --> 01:00:07.977
That's you, Marty.

01:00:08.019 --> 01:00:11.481
I know it's you.

01:00:11.522 --> 01:00:13.900
Know what makes you special?

01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:18.488
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

01:00:18.529 --> 01:00:20.490
You're a dreamer, Marty.

01:00:20.531 --> 01:00:24.493
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

01:00:24.534 --> 01:00:27.079
and horrible taste in friends.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.585
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

01:00:32.627 --> 01:00:34.087
OK, I'm in.

01:00:34.128 --> 01:00:36.506
Marty, you can't come with me.

01:00:36.547 --> 01:00:40.926
You don't have a choice.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.181
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

01:00:46.223 --> 01:00:48.183
The people will get you!

01:00:48.225 --> 01:00:51.103
Don't lose the hat!

01:00:51.144 --> 01:00:54.064
Bye, hat!

01:00:56.024 --> 01:00:57.984
Any water?

01:00:58.026 --> 01:01:03.240
No, just more diamonds and gold.

01:01:06.118 --> 01:01:07.577
Don't give up hope.

01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:10.496
Listen up! I will help you!

01:01:10.538 --> 01:01:14.291
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:17.504
I, your beloved King Julien

01:01:17.546 --> 01:01:22.509
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:26.053
in the volcano!

01:01:28.931 --> 01:01:30.307
What does that do?

01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:33.185
What does that do? Excellent question.

01:01:33.227 --> 01:01:36.397
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

01:01:36.439 --> 01:01:40.692
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:42.903
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:45.906
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

01:01:45.948 --> 01:01:48.284
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

01:01:48.325 --> 01:01:50.786
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:56.374
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

01:01:56.416 --> 01:01:59.586
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

01:01:59.627 --> 01:02:03.506
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

01:02:03.548 --> 01:02:05.176
What?

01:02:05.217 --> 01:02:06.677
Does it work?

01:02:06.719 --> 01:02:09.597
No! I mean, yes.

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:11.389
Well, Maurice?

01:02:11.431 --> 01:02:14.684
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

01:02:14.726 --> 01:02:17.604
We'll do it!

01:02:17.645 --> 01:02:19.606
Excellent!

01:02:19.647 --> 01:02:23.485
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

01:02:23.526 --> 01:02:26.278
and get eaten by gods.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.907
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

01:02:28.948 --> 01:02:32.786
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

01:02:32.827 --> 01:02:37.707
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

01:02:37.749 --> 01:02:42.044
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

01:02:49.343 --> 01:02:53.973
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

01:02:54.015 --> 01:02:56.309
Melman, what is wrong with you?

01:02:56.351 --> 01:03:01.271
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

01:03:01.313 --> 01:03:03.107
Are you nuts?

01:03:03.148 --> 01:03:05.901
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

01:03:05.943 --> 01:03:09.488
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:11.573
It was always you.

01:03:11.615 --> 01:03:14.075
Seeing you every day.

01:03:14.117 --> 01:03:18.705
That's what kept me going.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.001
Melman! Wait!

01:03:23.043 --> 01:03:27.339
Melman! Melman! Melman!

01:03:30.508 --> 01:03:33.803
You going to mope like this all day?

01:03:33.845 --> 01:03:35.596
Don't "hmph" me.

01:03:35.638 --> 01:03:39.267
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

01:03:39.308 --> 01:03:44.272
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

01:03:44.313 --> 01:03:47.275
What are you saying, woman?

01:03:47.316 --> 01:03:54.198
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

01:04:00.912 --> 01:04:03.206
Zuba!

01:04:03.248 --> 01:04:05.084
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

01:04:05.126 --> 01:04:06.794
What do you want?

01:04:06.836 --> 01:04:08.671
It's awful.

01:04:08.713 --> 01:04:10.506
The watering hole is dried up.

01:04:10.548 --> 01:04:13.468
Dried up? That's impossible!

01:04:13.509 --> 01:04:15.385
There's nothing left!

01:04:15.427 --> 01:04:19.306
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

01:04:19.347 --> 01:04:23.602
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

01:04:23.643 --> 01:04:25.187
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.982
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

01:04:28.024 --> 01:04:31.485
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

01:04:31.526 --> 01:04:37.074
You stay here, in case he comes back!

01:04:37.115 --> 01:04:40.327
Hurry, Zuba!

01:04:42.037 --> 01:04:45.540
I'm so parched.

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:52.506
Is this place starting to freak you out?

01:04:52.547 --> 01:04:57.094
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

01:04:57.135 --> 01:04:59.096
Why are we doing this?

01:04:59.137 --> 01:05:02.890
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.393
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:08.604
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

01:05:08.646 --> 01:05:14.068
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:16.196
What?!

01:05:16.238 --> 01:05:18.072
As far as my dad is concerned.

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:20.866
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

01:05:20.908 --> 01:05:24.203
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

01:05:24.245 --> 01:05:27.289
Marty, this is it!

01:05:27.331 --> 01:05:31.919
This is the clog! Come on.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:41.095
Well, there's the water.

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:43.973
Stay down. Look at that.

01:05:44.014 --> 01:05:46.392
Knit one, purl two.

01:05:46.434 --> 01:05:47.476
It's her.

01:05:47.518 --> 01:05:49.269
- Is this right?
- Very good.

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:51.271
Nana, slow down.

01:05:51.312 --> 01:05:54.065
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

01:05:54.107 --> 01:05:57.402
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

01:05:57.444 --> 01:05:59.070
We need dynamite. Got any?

01:05:59.112 --> 01:06:05.368
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.370
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

01:06:07.412 --> 01:06:09.789
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

01:06:09.831 --> 01:06:13.001
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

01:06:13.043 --> 01:06:15.670
No, no! Squiggly squid!

01:06:15.712 --> 01:06:17.005
Etch A Sketch!

01:06:17.047 --> 01:06:22.176
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

01:06:22.217 --> 01:06:26.180
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

01:06:26.221 --> 01:06:29.768
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:33.980
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

01:06:34.022 --> 01:06:37.191
Save us
We love you

01:06:37.232 --> 01:06:38.776
OK.

01:06:38.817 --> 01:06:41.904
OK, OK, OK.

01:06:48.535 --> 01:06:50.288
- Save us
- Melman

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:52.081
- We love you
- Melman

01:06:52.122 --> 01:06:53.165
Save us

01:06:53.207 --> 01:06:55.667
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

01:06:55.709 --> 01:06:57.669
- Melman
- We love you

01:06:57.711 --> 01:06:59.380
- Melman
- Save us

01:06:59.421 --> 01:07:02.800
Here we go! Here we go!

01:07:02.841 --> 01:07:05.386
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

01:07:05.427 --> 01:07:08.096
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

01:07:08.137 --> 01:07:11.891
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

01:07:11.933 --> 01:07:15.187
So Melman's not dying!

01:07:15.229 --> 01:07:18.190
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

01:07:18.232 --> 01:07:19.483
Melman!

01:07:19.525 --> 01:07:21.068
Move!

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:24.904
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

01:07:24.946 --> 01:07:29.784
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

01:07:29.826 --> 01:07:32.245
Yes!

01:07:33.413 --> 01:07:37.375
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

01:07:37.417 --> 01:07:39.669
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

01:07:39.711 --> 01:07:42.714
Because...

01:08:00.313 --> 01:08:02.275
You can't do this, Melman.

01:08:02.316 --> 01:08:04.193
First, that hurts.

01:08:04.235 --> 01:08:07.405
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

01:08:07.447 --> 01:08:11.074
Melman, I gotta know...

01:08:11.116 --> 01:08:14.578
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

01:08:14.619 --> 01:08:16.287
Of course I did.

01:08:16.328 --> 01:08:20.709
- That's crazy.
- It is?

01:08:21.126 --> 01:08:25.671
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

01:08:25.714 --> 01:08:28.800
...to find out the perfect guy for me

01:08:28.841 --> 01:08:31.470
lived right next door.

01:08:31.511 --> 01:08:33.971
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

01:08:34.014 --> 01:08:36.975
You and me for the next 18 hours.

01:08:37.017 --> 01:08:41.729
I'll take whatever you got.

01:08:43.522 --> 01:08:46.776
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

01:08:46.817 --> 01:08:49.863
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

01:08:49.904 --> 01:08:53.867
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

01:08:53.908 --> 01:08:58.871
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

01:08:58.912 --> 01:09:02.792
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:04.585
Now, maternity leave.

01:09:04.627 --> 01:09:08.089
Maternity leave? You're all males.

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:10.674
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

01:09:10.716 --> 01:09:13.676
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

01:09:13.719 --> 01:09:17.098
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

01:09:17.139 --> 01:09:23.979
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:33.404
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:42.163
All right. You get your maternity leave.

01:09:42.206 --> 01:09:44.999
Finally.

01:09:48.211 --> 01:09:51.589
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

01:09:51.631 --> 01:09:55.593
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

01:09:55.635 --> 01:09:57.262
This is wrong.

01:09:57.303 --> 01:10:00.890
You see? You are survivors.

01:10:00.932 --> 01:10:05.186
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

01:10:05.228 --> 01:10:06.771
You can't eat a lion.

01:10:06.813 --> 01:10:08.773
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

01:10:08.815 --> 01:10:11.901
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

01:10:11.943 --> 01:10:16.196
She's out of her mind, people!

01:10:16.238 --> 01:10:18.198
I'm from New York City!

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.456
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

01:10:28.334 --> 01:10:30.169
Dad!

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:36.383
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

01:10:36.425 --> 01:10:38.302
Stay behind me.

01:10:38.343 --> 01:10:41.764
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:43.474
Stay back!

01:10:43.515 --> 01:10:48.604
You'd let your dinner get away?

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:59.364
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

01:10:59.406 --> 01:11:02.825
What the heck?

01:11:05.536 --> 01:11:08.164
Hey, I know those moves.

01:11:08.206 --> 01:11:10.708
Alex?

01:11:12.836 --> 01:11:15.381
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

01:11:15.422 --> 01:11:16.798
It is Alex!

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:22.136
Only one lion can move like that!

01:11:24.806 --> 01:11:26.391
He's beautiful.

01:11:26.432 --> 01:11:30.353
I can't believe it.

01:11:34.231 --> 01:11:38.236
How does he do that?

01:11:49.413 --> 01:11:50.664
What are you doing?

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:53.667
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:56.169
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:59.214
Butterfly!

01:12:00.508 --> 01:12:05.595
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.732
Roar!

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:29.578
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

01:12:29.619 --> 01:12:32.873
Dad, look out!

01:12:32.914 --> 01:12:34.291
What the...

01:12:34.332 --> 01:12:36.083
Alex! Get in!

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:39.962
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

01:12:40.004 --> 01:12:41.672
- What?
- She's got a gun!

01:12:41.714 --> 01:12:47.011
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

01:12:47.721 --> 01:12:52.475
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

01:12:52.516 --> 01:12:55.770
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:59.273
All right! But it's his funeral.

01:12:59.315 --> 01:13:02.359
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:06.905
Bring it on! Bring it on!

01:13:11.327 --> 01:13:13.788
Come back! That's my dinner!

01:13:13.829 --> 01:13:18.084
Kowalski, full throttle.

01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:20.169
Music!

01:13:20.211 --> 01:13:22.879
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:27.592
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

01:13:27.634 --> 01:13:32.263
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

01:13:32.305 --> 01:13:36.560
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

01:13:36.602 --> 01:13:39.479
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

01:13:39.521 --> 01:13:45.693
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

01:13:45.735 --> 01:13:50.198
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.783
Are you sure?

01:13:51.825 --> 01:13:56.578
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.624
No! Medic!

01:14:02.711 --> 01:14:06.131
Ramming speed!

01:14:08.632 --> 01:14:11.844
Bring it on!

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.222
Bad kitties.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.773
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

01:14:24.815 --> 01:14:27.568
The science seemed so solid.

01:14:27.609 --> 01:14:35.993
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.292
It's you! I found you!

01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:46.837
Mort?

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:51.008
Bad fishy!

01:14:59.724 --> 01:15:01.893
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

01:15:01.934 --> 01:15:04.979
Let's find out.

01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:08.441
Look, Maurice.

01:15:08.816 --> 01:15:10.860
- That was quick.
- I did it!

01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:14.697
I did it! I did it!

01:15:14.739 --> 01:15:15.990
OK, you did it!

01:15:16.032 --> 01:15:18.826
Oh, yes!

01:15:43.934 --> 01:15:45.394
Look!

01:15:45.435 --> 01:15:48.397
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

01:15:48.438 --> 01:15:50.273
You did it!

01:15:50.315 --> 01:15:54.820
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

01:15:58.615 --> 01:16:01.159
Zuba! Alakay!

01:16:01.201 --> 01:16:03.995
You're back!

01:16:04.037 --> 01:16:06.873
I'm so glad you're safe!

01:16:06.915 --> 01:16:09.292
Out of my way.

01:16:09.334 --> 01:16:12.587
Well, well, well.

01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:17.466
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

01:16:17.508 --> 01:16:19.593
And you were kicked out.

01:16:19.635 --> 01:16:23.598
So don't think that this
changes anything.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.561
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

01:16:28.602 --> 01:16:30.980
A man bag. Very popular where I'm from.

01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:33.357
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

01:16:33.399 --> 01:16:38.779
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

01:16:38.821 --> 01:16:40.990
But you're still banished.

01:16:41.032 --> 01:16:44.993
We figured you'd say that.

01:16:45.035 --> 01:16:47.872
My handbag!

01:16:47.913 --> 01:16:51.333
You bad kitty!

01:16:53.335 --> 01:16:58.049
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:08.475
You deserve this, son.

01:17:08.516 --> 01:17:12.605
Welcome to the pride.

01:17:15.316 --> 01:17:18.485
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

01:17:18.526 --> 01:17:22.030
No, son. To us!

01:17:26.201 --> 01:17:31.080
My son! The King of New York!

01:17:31.997 --> 01:17:35.502
That's my baby!

01:17:41.424 --> 01:17:44.969
Love transcends all differences.

01:17:45.011 --> 01:17:50.182
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

01:17:50.224 --> 01:17:57.023
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

01:17:57.107 --> 01:17:59.693
For better, please.

01:17:59.734 --> 01:18:02.569
What a beautiful, weird couple!

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:05.572
That's not going to last.

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:07.783
Can I kiss the bride?

01:18:07.825 --> 01:18:10.077
No! Music!

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:11.578
- Struts.
- Check.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.788
- Flaps!
- Check.

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:17.084
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:18.793
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

01:18:18.835 --> 01:18:20.086
See you later!

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:23.090
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:25.092
or whenever the gold runs out.

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:26.468
Come back soon!

01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:31.557
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

01:18:31.598 --> 01:18:33.683
You're right about that!

01:18:33.725 --> 01:18:35.685
As long as I'm with her...

01:18:35.727 --> 01:18:39.772
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

01:18:39.814 --> 01:18:44.903
She has the most amazing laugh.

01:18:45.112 --> 01:18:48.365
Love has no boundaries!

01:18:48.407 --> 01:18:53.786
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

01:18:53.828 --> 01:18:56.289
Dad? What's wrong?

01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:01.377
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

01:19:01.419 --> 01:19:03.755
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

01:19:03.796 --> 01:19:10.094
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:12.388
I got you, son!

01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:14.766
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

01:19:14.807 --> 01:19:17.268
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:20.562
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

01:19:20.604 --> 01:19:22.856
Ain't no Marty here.

01:19:22.898 --> 01:19:27.361
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

01:19:27.402 --> 01:19:30.655
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

01:19:30.697 --> 01:19:34.077
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

01:19:34.118 --> 01:19:37.371
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

01:19:37.412 --> 01:19:39.289
But now that I'm home

01:19:39.331 --> 01:19:43.502
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

01:19:43.543 --> 01:19:47.756
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!
