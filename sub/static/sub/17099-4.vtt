00:48.319 --> 00:50.941
Mr. Shanley, how does
it feel to be a free man?

00:51.626 --> 00:53.134
Incredible.

00:53.196 --> 00:55.098
I really can't describe it.

00:55.431 --> 00:58.308
I'm just... I'm so glad
to have my life back.

00:58.543 --> 01:00.479
Were you surprised the
judge ruled in your favour?

01:00.599 --> 01:01.835
I'm innocent.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.352
I fought this appeal
myself because I knew

01:04.387 --> 01:05.984
if I stood in before the judge

01:06.104 --> 01:07.846
and showed him what was in my heart,

01:07.868 --> 01:09.157
he'd have to set me free.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.586
What will you do with
your first day of freedom?

01:11.779 --> 01:12.997
I want to see my son.

01:13.117 --> 01:14.347
In fact,

01:14.624 --> 01:16.488
he should be here with my ex-wife.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.048
Father!

01:22.054 --> 01:23.111
Philip!

01:23.620 --> 01:24.793
Look at you.

01:25.983 --> 01:27.532
You're all grown up.

01:29.353 --> 01:31.616
I haven't seen my son in
twelve years, I'm sorry.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.518
- Mr. Shanley...
- No more questions, please.

01:33.568 --> 01:36.174
I'll be happy to speak to
all of you at another time.

01:36.605 --> 01:38.254
Just one more question

01:38.326 --> 01:41.065
Do you hold any ill will toward the
Detective who sent you to prison?

01:43.112 --> 01:45.674
"I hold no ill will
toward Detective Murdoch.

01:45.978 --> 01:49.000
The guilt that man must
feel for wrongfully sending

01:49.005 --> 01:51.617
an innocent man to prison
is punishment enough."

01:51.678 --> 01:53.979
- They've released him, have they?
- Yes.

01:54.450 --> 01:57.466
- Do you feel guilty?
- Me? No.

01:58.075 --> 01:59.552
The man is a murderer.

01:59.672 --> 02:02.894
He deserves to spend the
rest of his life behind bars.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.991
I can't imagine how he
could have been set free.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.120
Nor I.

02:11.154 --> 02:13.217
I had another look at the case file.

02:13.251 --> 02:16.687
If you recall, Gus Shanley
killed his friend, Rex Landon,

02:16.721 --> 02:19.278
by putting thallium in his
cocoa one night after dinner.

02:19.338 --> 02:21.456
We found the cocoa tin in his home.

02:21.491 --> 02:23.931
And my test proved that
it contained poison.

02:23.998 --> 02:26.493
Are they thinking someone
else may have contaminated it?

02:26.797 --> 02:28.513
His wife was out of town.

02:28.546 --> 02:30.870
His co-worker testified that Mr. Shanley

02:30.886 --> 02:33.780
purchased the cocoa and thallium
the day before the murder.

02:34.107 --> 02:36.365
If the victim was a friend
of his, what was the motive?

02:36.485 --> 02:38.081
Mr. Shanley believed the man

02:38.115 --> 02:40.123
was being too forward with his wife.

02:40.150 --> 02:43.067
We found a series of
threatening anonymous letters

02:43.094 --> 02:46.823
that a handwriting expert
determined Mr. Shanley wrote.

02:46.867 --> 02:50.381
Then the evidence was sound,
so why was he released?

02:51.896 --> 02:54.032
Apparently, Doctor, you made a mistake.

02:54.536 --> 02:55.730
Me?

02:55.929 --> 02:57.036
Judge's report.

02:57.097 --> 02:59.665
Seems that Shanley found
some lab man in New York City

02:59.670 --> 03:02.062
who proved your initial
testing could have been wrong.

03:02.553 --> 03:06.056
"Thallium mistaken for other,
non-poisonous elements"?

03:06.366 --> 03:07.749
This is nonsense.

03:07.804 --> 03:09.547
Well, it is a rather thick file,

03:09.552 --> 03:11.544
perhaps it bears reading thoroughly.

03:12.152 --> 03:14.449
But it's most likely baseless.

03:15.168 --> 03:17.310
The Crown wants to take
another look at the case.

03:17.354 --> 03:19.408
See if there's enough
evidence for a retrial.

03:20.049 --> 03:21.676
Well, there is a preponderance here.

03:21.716 --> 03:23.950
I'll have a full report
by tomorrow morning.

03:24.381 --> 03:27.408
Right. The thing is, me old mucker,

03:27.663 --> 03:29.405
they don't want you anywhere near it.

03:33.019 --> 03:34.486
Detective Murdoch,

03:34.606 --> 03:37.345
meet Detective Watts, new
man over at Station House One.

03:37.369 --> 03:39.428
Ah, so you're the one who botched it.

03:39.548 --> 03:40.679
Excuse me?

03:40.799 --> 03:42.577
That's why I'm here, isn't it?

03:43.501 --> 03:46.002
Listen, Detective
Murdoch did nothing wrong.

03:46.179 --> 03:48.586
The Crown is just worried that
Shanley may claim prejudice

03:48.636 --> 03:51.276
- if the same detective reinvestigates the case.
- Right, right, right.

03:51.312 --> 03:54.451
You're just biased. The
coroner's the one who botched it.

03:55.088 --> 03:57.573
Coroners. Odd lot.

03:57.833 --> 04:00.522
Far from reliable, to say the least.

04:00.642 --> 04:02.393
Not to mention the smell.

04:02.448 --> 04:04.956
Our coroner has a flawless record.

04:04.992 --> 04:07.544
And she also happens to be my wife.

04:07.931 --> 04:10.825
Good god, man, you're
married to the city coroner?

04:10.869 --> 04:13.166
- Yes.
- Oof. Is she pretty?

04:13.199 --> 04:15.285
She'd have to be pretty,
I don't know how else

04:15.291 --> 04:17.819
you could tolerate being
married to a colleague.

04:18.450 --> 04:21.543
Why don't we leave you to review
the case files, Detective Watts.

04:21.974 --> 04:24.088
Yes. Feel free to use my office

04:24.121 --> 04:27.131
- if you must.
- Not necessary. The streets of this

04:27.396 --> 04:31.059
fine city are my office.

04:34.287 --> 04:35.739
This everything?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.904
There may be an evidence box.

04:38.915 --> 04:40.990
But given that the case
is twelve years old,

04:41.012 --> 04:42.660
it may take some time to locate it.

04:42.695 --> 04:43.955
Let me know when it's located.

04:44.005 --> 04:46.572
Uh, you... let me know.

04:46.692 --> 04:49.483
I'm afraid your involvement
has to end here, Detective.

04:57.142 --> 04:59.758
You there.

04:59.878 --> 05:01.934
How long have you been working here?

05:02.388 --> 05:03.887
Ten years, more or less.

05:03.926 --> 05:06.394
There's been time off here and there,
I was incarcerated for a short while...

05:06.421 --> 05:08.192
- Were you here for the Shanley case?
- No.

05:08.312 --> 05:09.425
Perfect.

05:10.770 --> 05:14.090
Hopefully you'll be of more help
than the dullards at Station One.

05:14.125 --> 05:16.668
With me, Constable.

05:16.972 --> 05:18.360
Go on, Crabtree.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.729
Oh, Detective...

05:20.751 --> 05:22.303
no hard feelings on leaving

05:22.336 --> 05:24.467
you out of the investigation, I hope.

05:24.494 --> 05:25.702
In fact,

05:25.737 --> 05:28.683
are you free for dinner? Good.

05:30.868 --> 05:32.908
I don't understand a word of this.

05:32.943 --> 05:34.963
Mr. Shanley was quite clever.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.651
He understood that if
he could raise a question

05:36.662 --> 05:37.945
about one key piece of evidence,

05:37.968 --> 05:40.109
his entire case would
have to be thrown out.

05:40.229 --> 05:44.264
But how can he challenge a
scientific laboratory test?

05:44.384 --> 05:46.776
Well, the Crown claimed that he

05:47.208 --> 05:49.216
poisoned his friend with thallium.

05:49.336 --> 05:51.933
- And the man did die of thallium poisoning.
- Without a doubt.

05:51.950 --> 05:55.264
And Detective Murdoch found
the cocoa tin in Shanley's home.

05:55.546 --> 05:58.734
The final piece was to prove
that there had been thallium

05:58.745 --> 06:00.040
mixed into the cocoa,

06:00.044 --> 06:02.385
and that's where Mr.
Shanley found a weak spot.

06:02.983 --> 06:04.764
And what is the test for thallium?

06:04.884 --> 06:08.119
Well, today we'd test the
sample with a spectroscope.

06:08.239 --> 06:09.634
There'd be no question.

06:09.683 --> 06:12.671
Twelve years ago, I didn't
have a spectroscope. So...

06:15.415 --> 06:16.655
That flash of green?

06:16.688 --> 06:18.105
That's thallium.

06:18.664 --> 06:21.364
The problem is that other
metals also burn green.

06:21.414 --> 06:24.396
So you might've seen something
else and mistaken it as thallium.

06:24.406 --> 06:26.908
Precisely. And that's
where it gets interesting.

06:27.107 --> 06:29.033
Why would cocoa have metal in it?

06:30.178 --> 06:33.301
- I can't think of a reason.
- Well, Mr. Shanley found one.

06:33.304 --> 06:35.174
For a brief time in the 1890s,

06:35.180 --> 06:38.205
Callahan Cocoa used tins
made of a copper alloy.

06:38.389 --> 06:39.939
And then a scientist in New York

06:39.983 --> 06:41.859
proved that small amounts of the copper

06:41.887 --> 06:44.000
could leech into the tin's contents.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.657
- And copper burns green.
- It does.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.258
A different, much duller
green, but close enough

06:49.275 --> 06:51.992
that Mr. Shanley and the judge
think I could've made a mistake.

06:52.766 --> 06:54.089
Is that possible?

06:54.621 --> 06:56.457
I have a way to find out.

06:57.226 --> 07:00.393
- Where are we going, Detective?
- To investigate.

07:00.569 --> 07:02.301
To investigate what exactly?

07:02.421 --> 07:05.322
Should I read the case
files? Absolutely not.

07:05.327 --> 07:08.154
The less you know, the
more pure you remain.

07:08.169 --> 07:11.164
From purity emerges truth.

07:11.284 --> 07:13.872
From truth emerges...

07:14.937 --> 07:16.188
I...

07:16.482 --> 07:18.219
- Justice.
- Justice.

07:18.235 --> 07:19.895
So it's better if I know nothing at all.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.308
Knowing nothing allows one to

07:22.428 --> 07:24.858
- see everything.
- You there.

07:25.727 --> 07:28.356
Detective Watts. Louise
Cherry, Toronto Gazette.

07:28.387 --> 07:30.047
- Can you comment on the Shanley case?
- No.

07:32.239 --> 07:35.112
- What's your name, Constable?
- Uh, George...

07:35.143 --> 07:37.564
- Constable George Crabtree. But I...
- Spell that for me?

07:37.838 --> 07:39.592
Uh, George.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.451
Then "crab"... then

07:41.619 --> 07:44.226
"tree." But I really know nothing
about the case, I'm afraid.

07:44.457 --> 07:47.016
Can you comment on the previous
Detective's investigation?

07:47.136 --> 07:48.233
Detective Murdoch?

07:48.353 --> 07:49.911
Well, I can tell you he's a good man.

07:50.672 --> 07:53.541
- He put an innocent man in prison.
- I highly doubt that.

07:53.581 --> 07:55.661
He's the best
investigator this city has.

07:56.024 --> 07:57.755
And an even better friend, mind you.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.778
You know him personally?

07:59.942 --> 08:01.203
Few know him better.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.598
So you're top chums, then?

08:03.638 --> 08:05.152
- Dearest friends?
- Top chums?

08:05.745 --> 08:07.636
You didn't hear it from me.

08:14.867 --> 08:16.582
Oh, uh...

08:16.606 --> 08:17.890
Can I help you?

08:18.147 --> 08:21.144
Detective Murdoch, what a pleasure.

08:21.365 --> 08:23.260
Perhaps you don't remember me.

08:23.472 --> 08:26.169
Geraldine Hanover. I
was your key witness

08:26.177 --> 08:27.736
- in the...
- The Shanley case.

08:27.909 --> 08:30.307
Miss Hanover, yes, of
course I remember you.

08:30.374 --> 08:32.644
You were his co-worker at the chemist's.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.220
That's right.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.402
I heard that the case has been reopened

08:36.522 --> 08:39.044
and I thought perhaps
I might be needed...

08:39.823 --> 08:42.015
Oh, well, a new detective

08:42.068 --> 08:44.520
has taken over the Shanley case,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.920
but I'm sure he would be
happy to hear from you.

08:47.929 --> 08:49.548
Oh, certainly.

08:49.610 --> 08:52.855
If I'm needed, I will
help however I can.

08:53.523 --> 08:54.665
What should I say?

08:56.046 --> 08:57.239
I don't understand.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.153
I can tell him whatever is necessary.

09:00.870 --> 09:05.147
What's necessary is
that you tell the truth.

09:05.525 --> 09:07.894
Just like you did twelve years ago.

09:09.355 --> 09:11.839
Do you think I'll be asked
back to the courthouse?

09:11.867 --> 09:15.381
- There were so many people there that day...
- Um,

09:15.979 --> 09:20.095
Miss Hanover, you did see Mr.
Shanley purchase the thallium,

09:20.162 --> 09:24.638
- did you not?
- I wore the prettiest dress.

09:25.109 --> 09:27.051
I do hope it still fits.

09:41.630 --> 09:43.771
Are you sure we couldn't
discuss the case?

09:45.104 --> 09:46.809
It would be inappropriate.

09:47.982 --> 09:49.399
Right.

09:49.826 --> 09:51.036
You...

09:51.971 --> 09:53.488
live in this hotel?

09:53.608 --> 09:56.028
Yes. Temporarily.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.120
I'm planning to build.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.768
My wife and I would like
a place to call our own.

10:03.066 --> 10:05.677
Our mind is where we live our lives.

10:05.899 --> 10:08.416
The only home one needs is...

10:09.053 --> 10:10.625
- the human skull.
- Hello.

10:10.675 --> 10:12.799
- It's been a while. My son.
- Hello.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.606
Detective Murdoch.

10:18.592 --> 10:19.870
Mr. Shanley.

10:20.191 --> 10:21.475
I wanted to say,

10:21.519 --> 10:24.651
I know you're not the only
one to blame for all of this.

10:24.983 --> 10:26.841
The past is the past.

10:27.241 --> 10:29.963
I'm just glad I'm free and I can
spend the evening with my son.

10:30.644 --> 10:32.963
So don't be too hard on yourself, eh?

10:40.886 --> 10:44.035
I must say, I question his sincerity.

10:44.549 --> 10:46.603
Why wouldn't you? The man's a murderer.

10:46.619 --> 10:48.927
That remains to be seen.

10:49.569 --> 10:53.038
I am perfectly capable of
admitting when I've made a mistake.

10:53.158 --> 10:55.860
But given the volume of
the evidence in this case,

10:55.915 --> 10:57.802
I find that nearly impossible.

10:57.841 --> 11:00.447
Do you actually believe
the man could be innocent?

11:00.580 --> 11:02.926
Mmm. This is very good.

11:03.631 --> 11:05.610
Do you think they have catsup here?

11:06.036 --> 11:08.438
Detective, please.

11:08.558 --> 11:11.116
Have you made any headway in this case?

11:11.144 --> 11:13.152
Have you spoken to witnesses?

11:15.106 --> 11:16.533
I suppose it can

11:16.594 --> 11:20.545
do no harm to sate your curiosity.

11:27.378 --> 11:30.078
Shanley's ex-wife won't say anything...

11:31.180 --> 11:33.282
That witness is now dead.

11:33.753 --> 11:34.941
Oh, so is he.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.269
Your handwriting man still thinks

11:38.296 --> 11:40.587
- Shanley wrote those letters...
- Good.

11:40.614 --> 11:42.366
Good. Those point strongly to motive.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.615
... but I spoke to another
handwriting man. Young,

11:45.096 --> 11:47.166
up to snuff on all the new

11:47.376 --> 11:50.422
loops and so forth and he's not so sure.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.245
And then there's the...

11:56.128 --> 11:57.838
- Co-worker.
- The co-worker.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.222
Miss Hanover.

11:59.615 --> 12:01.829
Oh yes, I spoke to her as well.

12:01.949 --> 12:04.102
Unfortunately, I no longer believe

12:04.119 --> 12:06.969
- her testimony to be reliable.
- Oh no...

12:07.262 --> 12:09.271
You interviewed a witness?

12:09.531 --> 12:13.295
- Oh no. She called on me...
- Your involvement was to cease entirely.

12:13.321 --> 12:16.075
Instead, it appears you are
continuing to seek a conviction.

12:16.092 --> 12:17.367
And based on what?

12:17.579 --> 12:19.855
A visual test

12:20.116 --> 12:23.807
done twelve years ago
by a neophyte coroner?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.631
Dr. Ogden is my wife.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.973
Which makes it all the more likely
you are blind to her mistakes.

12:29.973 --> 12:34.112
No, it appears this
dinner was a poor idea.

12:34.798 --> 12:36.148
Good night, Detective.

12:36.308 --> 12:37.755
What are you doing here?

12:38.724 --> 12:40.136
I can take care of myself.

12:40.256 --> 12:41.499
What have we here?

12:41.668 --> 12:43.677
Those would be the son's parents.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.967
Mr. Shanley's ex-wife
and her new husband.

12:47.024 --> 12:49.144
This is no place for a boy his age.

12:53.817 --> 12:56.185
It's all right, son. Go on, then.

12:59.443 --> 13:03.238
Mr. Ramsay doesn't seem to
care much for Mr. Shanley.

13:03.876 --> 13:07.015
I wonder if he isn't
worthy of suspicion...

13:07.507 --> 13:10.865
How could Samuel Ramsay
be under suspicion?

13:11.302 --> 13:14.155
He didn't even know the Shanleys
at the time of the murder.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.524
- Copper.
- Correct.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.493
The man wasn't even living
in Toronto at the time.

13:19.818 --> 13:23.349
It sounds like Detective Watts'
instincts leave something to be desired.

13:23.415 --> 13:25.186
His theories are as empty

13:25.201 --> 13:27.601
as his meaningless philosophies.

13:27.636 --> 13:30.919
He writes his case notes on detritus.
- Thallium.

13:31.039 --> 13:32.357
Correct.

13:33.359 --> 13:35.658
Let's say I was biased.

13:36.319 --> 13:38.594
I sought out evidence and testimony

13:38.614 --> 13:41.454
- to prove the man was guilty.
- Copper.

13:41.574 --> 13:44.901
- Correct.
- What about the laboratory reports?

13:45.089 --> 13:47.186
Science has no bias.

13:47.496 --> 13:48.622
Copper.

13:48.657 --> 13:50.119
Correct again.

13:50.185 --> 13:52.409
It's obvious you can tell
the difference, Julia.

13:52.481 --> 13:53.970
It seems absurd that some

13:53.987 --> 13:56.233
wild theory could discredit your work.

13:57.047 --> 13:58.115
Thallium.

13:59.111 --> 14:01.562
Surely your reputation
stands for something.

14:02.397 --> 14:04.638
Actually... that one was wrong.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.890
It was copper?

14:07.731 --> 14:08.799
Barium.

14:09.075 --> 14:10.370
Barium?

14:11.294 --> 14:14.764
- I hadn't even considered...
- I didn't intend to trick you, Doctor...

14:14.808 --> 14:17.016
No, Miss James, you were right to do so.

14:17.051 --> 14:19.604
But barium wasn't even
part of the investigation.

14:19.627 --> 14:21.508
Yes, but that's not the point.

14:21.779 --> 14:23.749
Today I didn't consider barium,

14:23.765 --> 14:27.013
just as twelve years ago
I hadn't considered copper.

14:27.461 --> 14:29.458
It's possible I saw thallium

14:29.508 --> 14:31.412
because I was looking for thallium.

14:31.932 --> 14:36.034
So it's possible we sent
an innocent man to prison?

14:45.639 --> 14:47.116
Sir, Detective,

14:47.138 --> 14:49.202
I've been instructed
not to let you inside.

14:49.467 --> 14:50.929
Is something wrong?

14:50.984 --> 14:52.124
They've found the evidence box.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.680
Detective Watts has
asked that Mr. Shanley

14:53.697 --> 14:55.235
be there to witness the opening.

14:55.274 --> 14:58.001
Couldn't they have opened
the box somewhere else?

14:58.121 --> 15:00.535
How long am I to be barred
from my own Station House?

15:00.568 --> 15:03.612
Sir, I know. I'll alert you as
soon as it's safe to come inside.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.388
George, George.

15:06.915 --> 15:10.655
Has Detective Watts made
any progress on the case?

15:11.392 --> 15:13.305
I'm afraid I can't
answer that question, sir.

15:13.339 --> 15:15.088
- George.
- Sir, I don't mean it like that.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.014
Although, he has asked
that I don't speak to you,

15:17.030 --> 15:19.575
but I'll hardly heed that
directive. What I mean, sir,

15:19.597 --> 15:21.816
is that he's largely kept me
in the dark about the case.

15:21.849 --> 15:24.533
Most of the things he's shared with
me, sir, could be described at best

15:24.544 --> 15:26.491
as abstract musings.

15:26.945 --> 15:29.590
- The man is a fool.
- I don't think that's entirely fair, sir.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.512
His methods are scattered, to be sure,

15:32.756 --> 15:35.577
but I actually find working
alongside him quite inspiring.

15:35.865 --> 15:37.088
Really?

15:37.265 --> 15:39.234
Truth be told, sir, it evokes a feeling

15:39.240 --> 15:41.016
not unlike when I first
began working with you.

15:41.851 --> 15:43.263
Oh.

15:45.642 --> 15:46.826
All set?

15:47.203 --> 15:48.558
Go ahead.

15:48.824 --> 15:51.264
There won't be anything
damning in there.

15:55.785 --> 15:57.693
Ah, there she is.

15:58.020 --> 16:00.034
The beautiful maiden that set me free.

16:00.045 --> 16:02.359
Oh, so you agree this is in fact your

16:02.420 --> 16:04.999
tin of cocoa from twelve years ago?

16:06.836 --> 16:09.243
- Well...
- Evidence records show this box

16:09.243 --> 16:10.754
has been untouched, Mr. Shanley,

16:10.874 --> 16:12.929
and you've just witnessed
me breaking the seal.

16:15.574 --> 16:18.739
- Not to mention it smells awful.
- Fine, yes,

16:19.082 --> 16:20.748
of course it's the tin.

16:21.169 --> 16:22.690
But there's no poison in it.

16:22.934 --> 16:25.021
You won't object if we test it again?

16:26.166 --> 16:27.222
I suppose not.

16:27.261 --> 16:29.042
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Not a thing.

16:29.053 --> 16:31.117
The spectroscope awaits
us at the city morgue.

16:31.144 --> 16:32.837
- Spectro-what?
- Spectroscope.

16:32.898 --> 16:35.189
Science has advanced at a rapid pace

16:35.216 --> 16:36.594
over the past twelve years.

16:36.633 --> 16:39.140
A spectroscopic analysis will leave

16:39.494 --> 16:41.890
- no doubt.
- Oh no, no, no.

16:42.010 --> 16:45.630
I won't be railroaded by another
one of your "science" tests.

16:45.675 --> 16:46.848
You want to do this...

16:46.887 --> 16:48.657
spectro business,

16:48.777 --> 16:50.428
I'll need to research it first.

16:50.450 --> 16:53.570
Then we will wait until
you have had time to do so.

16:53.609 --> 16:56.448
Why bother? We can test
it with or without him.

16:57.123 --> 16:59.923
Inspector, if we take this
evidence out of his sight

16:59.941 --> 17:01.171
even for a minute,

17:01.216 --> 17:04.260
he might turn around and
accuse us of tampering with it.

17:04.584 --> 17:06.747
The sample will be
kept under lock and key

17:06.761 --> 17:10.367
until such time as you're prepared
to oversee its examination.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.623
Tomorrow morning will be fine.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.344
This is the only key,

17:17.384 --> 17:18.959
and it will remain in this envelope

17:18.968 --> 17:20.770
until all parties are present.

17:21.315 --> 17:22.916
And why should I trust you?

17:23.178 --> 17:24.223
You shouldn't.

17:25.727 --> 17:27.016
The envelope will be sealed

17:27.038 --> 17:28.822
with both of your fingermarks.

17:28.888 --> 17:29.782
Gentlemen.

17:36.056 --> 17:36.989
Happy?

17:37.768 --> 17:39.061
Am I free to go?

17:44.107 --> 17:45.745
The detective was wrong.

17:46.215 --> 17:47.339
About what?

17:47.583 --> 17:48.875
You're not pretty.

17:49.946 --> 17:50.955
Excuse me?

17:51.372 --> 17:52.225
Look at you...

17:52.274 --> 17:54.438
Classic, Romanesque bone structure,

17:54.456 --> 17:56.678
excellent physiognomic symmetry...

17:56.709 --> 17:59.223
You're not pretty, you're beautiful.

18:00.865 --> 18:02.034
Well,

18:02.154 --> 18:04.207
- I suppose I'm flattered.
- Why?

18:04.233 --> 18:06.597
It's merely an objective assessment.

18:07.947 --> 18:09.364
But that necktie...

18:19.354 --> 18:21.049
Big smile, son.

18:21.206 --> 18:22.750
This is for the papers.

18:23.750 --> 18:24.941
That one should be a pip.

18:24.946 --> 18:26.079
Thank you, gents.

18:26.871 --> 18:28.637
Ah, Detective Murdoch!

18:29.067 --> 18:30.275
Join us?

18:31.537 --> 18:32.825
Come now.

18:34.308 --> 18:37.039
You take twelve years of my
life and you can't spare me

18:37.159 --> 18:38.849
two minutes of your time?

18:39.429 --> 18:41.677
I owe you nothing, Mr. Shanley.

18:42.133 --> 18:44.484
I merely provided evidence to the Crown.

18:44.838 --> 18:46.489
Of course, of course.

18:46.981 --> 18:48.118
It's not your fault.

18:48.374 --> 18:49.839
You were just doing your job.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.667
I'm glad you agree.

18:51.738 --> 18:53.973
And the lawyers were
just doing their jobs,

18:54.663 --> 18:56.199
the judge just doing his,

18:56.554 --> 18:59.506
the jury just doing their civic duty.

18:59.852 --> 19:02.242
The armed guards who kept
me under lock and key for

19:02.313 --> 19:05.634
3,996 days...

19:06.311 --> 19:08.298
They were all just doing their jobs.

19:08.922 --> 19:11.601
When the prime of my
life was flushed away,

19:11.796 --> 19:13.903
no one was to blame.

19:14.239 --> 19:16.240
Least of all the man who first

19:16.360 --> 19:18.086
decided I was guilty.

19:18.206 --> 19:20.184
You killed a man, Mr. Shanley.

19:20.197 --> 19:22.699
- Your punishment was just.
- You have no proof.

19:23.018 --> 19:24.222
You wrote the letters.

19:24.284 --> 19:26.369
Well, your replacement doesn't think so.

19:26.405 --> 19:28.374
The handwriting might
not prove anything,

19:28.600 --> 19:30.105
but the contents still do.

19:30.163 --> 19:31.428
Proves nothing.

19:31.645 --> 19:34.129
Maybe whoever wrote them
wanted it to look like me.

19:34.469 --> 19:36.559
Well, I suppose we'll
have to wait until morning.

19:36.679 --> 19:39.436
If that tin does
indeed contain thallium,

19:39.520 --> 19:41.978
then we'll know once and
for all that you are guilty.

19:42.443 --> 19:44.239
It's sad, really.

19:44.651 --> 19:48.072
You spend all your time
trying to prove I'm a villain.

19:48.156 --> 19:49.506
Because if I'm not,

19:49.949 --> 19:51.834
then the villain must be you.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.004
Well, either you or your wife.

19:55.283 --> 19:57.615
Watch your words, Mr. Shanley.

19:57.616 --> 19:59.794
She wanted to see me
hang twelve years ago.

19:59.846 --> 20:01.263
With this test tomorrow,

20:01.383 --> 20:03.434
I'm sure that harridan
will try to do it again.

20:03.646 --> 20:05.324
That's enough!

20:10.366 --> 20:12.863
What can possibly be so
important as to have a man

20:12.885 --> 20:14.823
out of bed before nine o'clock?

20:17.621 --> 20:19.829
Mr. Shanley has filed a lawsuit.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.936
Continued and undue harassment

20:21.958 --> 20:23.402
by the Toronto Constabulary.

20:23.774 --> 20:25.115
It was my fault.

20:25.150 --> 20:27.917
He engaged me, I never should
have spoken a word to him.

20:28.156 --> 20:29.789
Honestly, Inspector,

20:29.847 --> 20:31.617
how does anyone work with this man?

20:31.737 --> 20:33.923
He is some kind of renegade,

20:33.932 --> 20:37.053
to whom "rules" are a foreign concept.

20:37.173 --> 20:38.828
- Really?
- I hate to say,

20:38.845 --> 20:40.297
but this case is looking more and more

20:40.311 --> 20:43.396
like the personal vendetta
of a single police officer

20:43.413 --> 20:45.254
against an innocent man.

20:45.281 --> 20:48.286
I'm not in the habit of
letting guilty men walk free.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.155
I was doing my job.
And yours, coincidently,

20:51.203 --> 20:53.031
since you seem to be taking no action

20:53.054 --> 20:55.178
- to solve this case.
- Murdoch, that's enough.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.449
We have a report of another murder.

21:00.012 --> 21:02.376
- We'll continue this later.
- Actually,

21:03.084 --> 21:05.067
you'd better take
Detective Watts with you.

21:12.733 --> 21:14.791
When did this happen, Mrs. Ramsay?

21:14.862 --> 21:16.145
When I woke up this morning,

21:16.168 --> 21:17.420
I found him like this.

21:19.895 --> 21:21.895
- And you didn't hear anything?
- No.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.095
I went to bed sometime before eleven.

21:24.644 --> 21:26.366
I don't what could've happened.

21:28.601 --> 21:31.782
The pick is missing from the ice chest.

21:31.902 --> 21:35.107
That would be consistent with
the wound I'm seeing here.

21:40.938 --> 21:42.611
It appears you have to step down

21:42.611 --> 21:44.860
from this investigation too, Detective.

21:45.816 --> 21:49.048
And I have to say you were right.

21:49.615 --> 21:51.323
You believe Shanley is involved.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.413
One of the neighbours saw him

21:53.422 --> 21:55.312
arriving here late last night.

21:55.644 --> 21:57.645
Just when I'd convinced myself

21:57.676 --> 21:59.530
of his innocence...

22:00.783 --> 22:03.085
Well, it would appear he's killed again.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.180
So Ramsay was stabbed to death ***.

22:12.213 --> 22:14.128
Two stab wounds. Likely an ice pick.

22:14.172 --> 22:15.434
And we think Shanley did it.

22:15.554 --> 22:17.935
Neighbours saw him at
the house late last night.

22:17.996 --> 22:19.739
I spoke to him and the wife.

22:19.744 --> 22:22.416
They both agree she
invited him over to discuss

22:22.450 --> 22:24.054
custody of their son.

22:24.082 --> 22:26.213
If it's about the son,
that could be motive.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.740
Shanley got worried the new husband

22:27.745 --> 22:29.235
was standing between him and his family.

22:29.262 --> 22:31.360
Agreed. However, the victim was not

22:31.382 --> 22:34.356
present at their
tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. They spoke,

22:34.591 --> 22:36.561
Mrs. Ramsay served martini cocktails,

22:36.588 --> 22:38.704
then retired to bed, leaving Shanley

22:38.824 --> 22:40.067
to see himself out.

22:40.257 --> 22:42.289
And she never saw or
heard anything after that.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.083
Nothing. It's possible
Shanley just left,

22:45.092 --> 22:47.061
but it's also possible
that he stayed at the house,

22:47.181 --> 22:48.704
had some altercation with Ramsay,

22:48.735 --> 22:49.966
and he ended up killing him.

22:49.988 --> 22:51.741
We don't have evidence
to confirm it either way.

22:51.812 --> 22:53.959
Some of your men
searched Shanley's room.

22:54.029 --> 22:55.012
Nothing.

22:55.419 --> 22:56.836
Well, it's nearly eleven.

22:57.274 --> 22:59.788
I believe we have a test to
run for Shanley's other murder.

23:00.359 --> 23:02.718
I'm afraid we have a problem, gentlemen.

23:02.784 --> 23:05.882
The key is secure, but the
cabinet itself has been breached.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.927
I arrived this morning to
find that the front door

23:07.944 --> 23:09.113
had been forced open.

23:16.519 --> 23:18.064
I trusted you had this in hand.

23:18.082 --> 23:21.424
I posted men to patrol the area
all night, Inspector, but...

23:21.880 --> 23:23.323
Station One.

23:23.371 --> 23:25.859
- Dullards, to a man.
- We should've tested it yesterday.

23:25.890 --> 23:27.103
Can't test it now.

23:27.271 --> 23:29.290
Anyone could have taken
that and put poison in it.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.600
Or dumped the poison
that was already in there.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.109
Fresh as a daisy.

23:35.446 --> 23:37.481
What, you think I'm
responsible for this?

23:37.508 --> 23:39.349
You may have scuppered
this case, Shanley,

23:39.363 --> 23:40.532
but we'll have you dead to rights

23:40.541 --> 23:42.073
over the man you killed last night.

23:42.126 --> 23:44.618
This is incredible.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.040
You have less evidence and you're
accusing me of more murders.

23:48.399 --> 23:50.590
- I've had enough.
- You're not going anywhere.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.812
I'm holding you till we get this sorted.

23:56.486 --> 23:58.120
Dr. Ogden inspected the tin.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.474
There's no residue of old cocoa

23:59.478 --> 24:00.559
and no thallium in the new stuff.

24:00.603 --> 24:03.042
Which further points
to Mr. Shanley's guilt.

24:03.078 --> 24:05.654
And makes it impossible
to get a conviction on him.

24:06.087 --> 24:07.022
I'm going to have to let him go.

24:07.048 --> 24:08.947
I never should have let
Watts delay that test.

24:08.987 --> 24:11.568
Detective Watts couldn't have
anticipated this. Where is he?

24:12.037 --> 24:13.524
He's moved on to the second murder.

24:13.538 --> 24:15.353
He's having another
look in Shanley's rooms.

24:16.487 --> 24:20.217
Let us suppose for a
moment that Mr. Shanley

24:20.337 --> 24:21.790
is guilty of this

24:22.023 --> 24:23.976
current murder. Now,

24:23.980 --> 24:26.485
does that make him more or less likely

24:26.512 --> 24:28.588
to be guilty of the first?

24:29.133 --> 24:30.776
More likely, I would say.

24:30.975 --> 24:32.480
If a man kills once, it seems

24:32.600 --> 24:34.083
logical he might kill again.

24:34.772 --> 24:37.527
Are you the same man
today you were yesterday?

24:37.606 --> 24:38.722
Yes. Of course.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.970
Your hair is not the same.

24:42.005 --> 24:44.790
You cut and discarded it.

24:44.852 --> 24:46.326
Same with your fingernails.

24:46.339 --> 24:50.216
Over time, our entire
body falls away and is

24:50.583 --> 24:52.151
reconstituted.

24:52.656 --> 24:55.205
How, then, can you be the same?

24:56.073 --> 24:57.201
Well,

24:58.419 --> 25:00.895
I'm the same on the inside,
I suppose. I have the same

25:01.015 --> 25:02.527
thoughts, the same feelings.

25:04.217 --> 25:06.467
But our thinking changes with

25:06.587 --> 25:10.092
maturity, with experience. In truth, the

25:10.149 --> 25:12.726
continuity of personhood may be

25:12.757 --> 25:14.678
nothing more than a delusion.

25:15.399 --> 25:16.223
So,

25:16.343 --> 25:18.600
even if Shanley was a killer last night,

25:19.003 --> 25:21.012
the man he is today could be innocent?

25:21.486 --> 25:22.539
Why, yes.

25:23.062 --> 25:24.306
Yes.

25:24.518 --> 25:26.426
That's very good, Constable.

25:27.001 --> 25:29.746
In fact, it makes me question
our whole profession...

25:34.384 --> 25:36.000
Well, Detective Watts,

25:37.280 --> 25:38.944
if Shanley's a different man,

25:39.471 --> 25:42.061
looks like he'll be paying
for somebody else's mistakes.

25:55.009 --> 25:56.112
Mr. Shanley,

25:56.474 --> 25:58.334
is it true you've been
accused of a second murder?

25:58.369 --> 26:00.511
Gus here has been
helping the constabulary

26:00.538 --> 26:03.162
- sort a few things out.
- I can answer for myself.

26:03.491 --> 26:05.663
In fact, I've been accused
of both a second murder

26:05.681 --> 26:07.009
and of stealing evidence.

26:07.239 --> 26:08.461
I'm just trying to lead my life,

26:08.479 --> 26:10.396
and the police continue to harass me.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.427
Is this retribution for your lawsuit?

26:12.825 --> 26:15.179
You may have hit the nail
right on top, Miss Cherry.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.805
Go home, Shanley.

26:16.818 --> 26:18.465
You're a free man. For now.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.943
I'm afraid not, Inspector.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.816
Mr. Shanley is under arrest by order

26:22.825 --> 26:24.237
of the Toronto Constabulary.

26:24.237 --> 26:26.840
- What are you talking about?
- Murder weapon.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.891
Found under a floorboard in your rooms.

26:30.488 --> 26:31.604
That's impossible!

26:31.688 --> 26:34.300
- I found it there myself.
- Then you put it there!

26:35.194 --> 26:36.597
You want to see me hang!

26:36.672 --> 26:38.509
You may not have been a
killer before, Shanley,

26:38.518 --> 26:41.697
- but you certainly are today.
- This is a farce! I'm innocent!

26:42.595 --> 26:44.264
Shanley's not saying a word.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.779
In fact, he refuses to
speak to us altogether.

26:47.899 --> 26:50.027
Surely we have enough
evidence to put him away.

26:50.147 --> 26:51.377
We found the murder weapon

26:51.390 --> 26:53.338
in Mr. Shanley's home
the first time, as well.

26:53.806 --> 26:56.033
We shouldn't take anything
for granted in this case.

26:56.223 --> 26:59.282
Well, Detective. The afternoon edition

26:59.300 --> 27:01.477
says you've managed
to fabricate evidence

27:01.477 --> 27:03.022
against Shanley once again.

27:03.359 --> 27:04.315
Me?

27:04.607 --> 27:06.974
Aside from setting
foot at the crime scene,

27:07.005 --> 27:09.329
I haven't interfered at all.

27:10.334 --> 27:11.901
The newspapers seem to think

27:11.932 --> 27:15.003
the constable who found
the murder weapon is your...

27:15.548 --> 27:16.796
"top chum."

27:17.783 --> 27:19.987
I... I... I didn't exactly say that.

27:20.049 --> 27:22.245
She said top chum and then I...

27:22.307 --> 27:24.666
She is very sneaky.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.985
She will ask you a question one day

27:26.003 --> 27:28.668
and then apply it later in a
completely different context.

27:28.668 --> 27:29.664
It is

27:29.678 --> 27:31.913
truly impossible to investigate a case

27:31.922 --> 27:34.188
outside of your influence,
isn't it, Detective?

27:34.188 --> 27:35.273
Right, that's enough.

27:35.295 --> 27:37.849
We're all on the same side here
so let's start acting like it.

27:37.897 --> 27:39.757
Crabtree didn't plant that ice pick

27:39.775 --> 27:41.713
and Murdoch didn't ask him to.

27:43.121 --> 27:46.064
Yes, well, I tend to believe you there.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.662
This one's a good egg,

27:48.702 --> 27:49.751
without a doubt.

27:50.181 --> 27:52.898
But the case is a shambles regardless.

27:53.331 --> 27:56.647
Could Mr. Shanley be a
victim of fabricated evidence?

27:56.683 --> 27:57.665
Impossible.

27:57.829 --> 27:59.582
I've led the investigation myself.

27:59.635 --> 28:02.207
Well, someone else could
have left the ice pick there.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.231
That's right, there were two searches.

28:04.315 --> 28:06.085
and nothing was found
the first time around.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.723
The floorboard was

28:07.926 --> 28:09.653
conspicuously unseated.

28:09.671 --> 28:11.278
It's hard to imagine
anyone would've missed it.

28:11.398 --> 28:14.208
Between the first search and the
second, someone could've gone in

28:14.248 --> 28:15.540
and planted the murder weapon.

28:15.606 --> 28:18.018
And if Mr. Shanley
was indeed the killer,

28:18.062 --> 28:20.444
he had several hours to dispose of it.

28:20.647 --> 28:23.532
Why bring the ice
pick back to his rooms?

28:24.644 --> 28:26.649
I will take another
look at that ice pick.

28:26.670 --> 28:27.835
I'll go with you.

28:27.955 --> 28:28.968
Detective...

28:28.999 --> 28:31.562
I've been held off of
this case for long enough.

28:31.589 --> 28:35.095
And we are all on the
same side here, correct?

28:36.122 --> 28:37.764
That is fair.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.273
With me, Detective.

28:43.969 --> 28:46.820
I suppose we'll never know if
you were right about the thallium.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.454
Short of a confession,
I imagine we won't.

28:51.932 --> 28:54.579
But perhaps we can
ascertain Mr. Shanley's guilt

28:54.584 --> 28:56.248
in this latest murder.

29:01.737 --> 29:03.148
Take a look at this.

29:05.725 --> 29:07.146
Bruise from the hilt.

29:07.385 --> 29:08.310
Deep.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.294
Likely pierced the heart.

29:11.320 --> 29:13.706
Almost certainly. Now
look at the second wound.

29:14.149 --> 29:15.535
Same size,

29:16.402 --> 29:18.438
probably the same implement.

29:20.487 --> 29:21.753
Oh my...

29:26.543 --> 29:28.252
These are Shanley's fingermarks.

29:28.424 --> 29:29.695
That seals it then.

29:30.392 --> 29:33.046
However, some of the marks are smudged,

29:33.166 --> 29:35.410
as if this weapon was handled

29:35.415 --> 29:37.469
with gloves or cloth.

29:38.712 --> 29:41.044
I picked it up with my handkerchief.

29:42.315 --> 29:43.572
No, these smudges occurred

29:43.581 --> 29:45.064
while the blood was still fresh.

29:45.746 --> 29:47.535
I think it's unlikely that Mr. Shanley

29:47.566 --> 29:50.204
would have stabbed a man
with his bare hand, and then

29:50.217 --> 29:52.837
placed gloves on his hands to handle

29:52.859 --> 29:54.749
the weapon after the fact.

29:55.033 --> 29:56.082
Gentlemen.

29:56.392 --> 29:59.404
Mr. Ramsay was killed with a
single stab wound to the heart.

29:59.448 --> 30:01.351
No, he was stabbed twice, as I recall.

30:01.551 --> 30:03.343
Indeed, but the second wound

30:03.361 --> 30:05.220
has no bruising or discolouration.

30:05.251 --> 30:07.398
It was inflicted at least
half an hour after death.

30:07.686 --> 30:10.191
I can only think of
one reason to stab a man

30:10.222 --> 30:12.147
long after he is already dead.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.630
To apply fresh blood to the weapon.

30:19.353 --> 30:21.720
Let's piece together what we know.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.112
On a blackboard?

30:23.160 --> 30:24.179
Nonsense.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.892
We need to get out of doors, Detective.

30:26.923 --> 30:29.239
The truth is in the air.

30:29.314 --> 30:30.620
We must breathe it in.

30:33.059 --> 30:35.091
Someone else handled that ice pick.

30:35.356 --> 30:38.039
Which means Mr. Shanley
was telling the truth.

30:38.464 --> 30:40.146
About that, yes.

30:40.208 --> 30:41.726
Release your suspicions.

30:42.084 --> 30:43.850
If he told the truth once,

30:44.010 --> 30:47.289
he may have told it again. And again.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.679
About everything.

30:49.573 --> 30:50.441
All right.

30:50.746 --> 30:52.433
So he went to the house.

30:52.845 --> 30:56.412
She had him make ice for
the martini cocktails.

30:56.532 --> 30:59.948
Then Mr. Shanley left after
Mrs. Ramsay went to sleep.

31:00.028 --> 31:02.795
Leaving Mrs. Ramsay in
the house with her husband.

31:04.375 --> 31:07.873
We did find a report for that
address from some time ago.

31:07.921 --> 31:11.317
But all it said was "Family
conflict, no arrest."

31:11.498 --> 31:12.697
Is that so?

31:13.392 --> 31:15.384
Indulge me, Detective.

31:15.694 --> 31:19.125
Let us put ourselves in the mind

31:19.191 --> 31:21.161
of Mrs. Ramsay.

31:21.188 --> 31:22.627
It's late at night.

31:22.649 --> 31:24.800
I've just met with my ex-husband.

31:24.827 --> 31:27.793
I'm in the mood for another drink.

31:27.841 --> 31:29.342
I need more ice.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.214
I go down to the cellar.

31:32.329 --> 31:35.166
- And that's when...
- ... My husband comes in...

31:39.974 --> 31:42.608
- Can I give you a hand?
- I detest him.

31:42.772 --> 31:45.322
The man has been cruel to me for years.

31:45.442 --> 31:48.127
So much so that I once had
to telephone the police.

31:48.672 --> 31:50.412
This is my chance.

31:51.922 --> 31:53.830
I stab him through the chest.

31:56.137 --> 31:58.368
I've killed him. I'm going to jail.

31:58.488 --> 31:59.730
Unless...

32:00.049 --> 32:02.120
unless I can lay the blame elsewhere.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.904
I just happen to know a renowned killer.

32:05.692 --> 32:07.723
But how can I make him look good for it?

32:11.101 --> 32:14.544
The murder happened before
Mr. Shanley came to the house.

32:15.761 --> 32:16.907
Of course.

32:16.938 --> 32:19.571
I invite him over
expressly so the neighbours

32:19.580 --> 32:21.983
can later say he was at
the scene of the crime.

32:22.466 --> 32:25.178
But how can I get his fingermarks
onto the murder weapon?

32:25.586 --> 32:27.409
She wiped the ice pick clean.

32:27.896 --> 32:30.995
Then Mr. Shanley had to
use it to chip the ice.

32:31.013 --> 32:32.957
Once he touched it, all she had to do

32:33.023 --> 32:35.826
was stab the corpse once
more and cover it with blood.

32:36.237 --> 32:38.242
Crackerjack! I believe we have it.

32:46.334 --> 32:48.184
Are you going to ask me something?

32:48.214 --> 32:49.232
Hm?

32:49.781 --> 32:51.172
Oh, no.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.960
What would be the point?

32:53.421 --> 32:55.196
We both know you didn't do it.

32:55.851 --> 32:57.502
Then why am I here?

32:57.975 --> 32:59.821
We have to blame someone.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.433
The function of the police
is to attribute blame

33:03.455 --> 33:05.486
on behalf of the community. But

33:05.672 --> 33:08.134
the community doesn't particularly care

33:08.138 --> 33:09.510
if we blame the right person.

33:09.630 --> 33:10.957
Of course they do.

33:11.391 --> 33:14.100
- You can't put me away if I'm innocent.
- Why not?

33:14.423 --> 33:17.804
Man has been using
scapegoats since Leviticus.

33:17.822 --> 33:20.168
The sins were placed
upon the goat, the goat

33:20.203 --> 33:21.952
was banished to the desert, but

33:22.036 --> 33:23.824
no one cared that the goat was innocent.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.014
You're the police.

33:25.227 --> 33:26.382
You have to care.

33:27.153 --> 33:28.233
Fine.

33:28.401 --> 33:29.574
Then who did it?

33:29.911 --> 33:31.823
- Gus Shanley.
- Oh.

33:32.075 --> 33:34.545
- Was that why you tried to kill him?
- What?

33:34.735 --> 33:36.231
I did no such thing.

33:36.258 --> 33:39.061
You didn't try to kill
Mr. Shanley this morning?

33:39.596 --> 33:40.765
No!

33:41.075 --> 33:42.930
Then why were you at his building?

33:43.793 --> 33:45.962
Witnesses saw you there. Do you deny it?

33:46.299 --> 33:49.652
- No, but...
- If you knew he was the killer,

33:49.675 --> 33:52.348
why would you go there
if not to seek revenge?

33:53.136 --> 33:55.239
- I...
- What other reason could there be?

33:57.368 --> 33:58.625
Oh yes.

33:58.838 --> 34:01.884
There is one other reason, isn't there?

34:03.070 --> 34:04.597
To plant the murder weapon.

34:08.435 --> 34:10.400
Oh, and his little teeth are coming in.

34:10.521 --> 34:12.304
Constable "Crab", then "tree".

34:12.360 --> 34:13.809
I've been looking all over for you.

34:13.835 --> 34:15.810
I don't have time, Miss Cherry.

34:16.253 --> 34:17.802
You aren't angry with me, are you?

34:17.851 --> 34:19.297
I only wrote what you told me.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.516
You made it look like
I was planting evidence.

34:21.784 --> 34:23.091
I posed a question.

34:23.118 --> 34:24.507
My readers draw their own conclusions.

34:24.529 --> 34:26.982
They draw their conclusions
based on what you write!

34:27.007 --> 34:28.597
The written word is a
powerful thing, Ms. Cherry,

34:28.614 --> 34:32.014
and you used it to paint
me as a gormless patsy,

34:32.058 --> 34:33.417
aiding in a police conspiracy

34:33.444 --> 34:35.896
headed by the vile and
corrupt Detective Murdoch.

34:36.089 --> 34:37.737
You have to admit it makes a good story.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.860
Just give me two minutes

34:38.891 --> 34:40.543
- and then go back to hating me.
- No.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.040
Good God.

34:46.806 --> 34:48.746
All right, all right, two minutes.

34:49.596 --> 34:50.516
Good.

34:50.636 --> 34:52.300
This morning I was going
through the Ramsays' trash...

34:52.322 --> 34:54.411
Their trash? To what end?

34:54.438 --> 34:56.755
I was hoping to piece together
some details for a story...

34:56.876 --> 34:58.803
"The Last Hours of Samuel Ramsay":

34:58.861 --> 35:01.069
last meal, last cigar,
that sort of thing.

35:01.313 --> 35:03.437
But I found something much better.

35:04.983 --> 35:06.177
Cocoa?

35:06.362 --> 35:09.049
There was fresh cocoa in that
old Callahan tin, was there not?

35:09.121 --> 35:11.418
This could be the
source of the new cocoa.

35:11.538 --> 35:12.520
But it's empty.

35:12.556 --> 35:13.737
The only thing that
would've been of help

35:13.760 --> 35:15.180
is the old cocoa itself.

35:16.761 --> 35:18.226
Then it's a good thing

35:18.510 --> 35:20.652
- I found that too.
- No...

35:21.364 --> 35:23.865
Found in the same trash can.

35:24.684 --> 35:26.313
Friends again, Constable?

35:26.433 --> 35:28.473
If you don't try that
fake crying act anymore.

35:31.944 --> 35:33.063
That's it, without a doubt.

35:33.183 --> 35:34.643
So who stole it from the morgue?

35:34.674 --> 35:35.701
It doesn't matter.

35:35.710 --> 35:37.923
We'll never be able to
prove it's the same cocoa.

35:38.382 --> 35:40.124
Can't we just test how old it is?

35:40.244 --> 35:43.598
We don't have a method any more
scientific than your smell test.

35:43.970 --> 35:46.467
Then this new tin is quite useless.

35:46.976 --> 35:48.807
But thank you, Constable.

35:48.927 --> 35:51.815
This man. He impresses, he impresses,

35:51.828 --> 35:53.545
he impresses again.

35:53.838 --> 35:55.174
How did you find it?

35:55.427 --> 35:57.915
Interesting story, actually.
Remember the journalist,

35:57.935 --> 35:59.615
who I said was very sneaky...

36:00.057 --> 36:01.593
Apologies, Constable,

36:01.713 --> 36:03.979
I look forward to hearing
the rest of your account in

36:04.099 --> 36:05.923
all its detail, but I have the

36:06.043 --> 36:08.781
overwhelming sense our
associate here has a

36:09.029 --> 36:10.370
notion brewing.

36:14.695 --> 36:16.049
There might be a way.

36:23.512 --> 36:24.880
What am I looking at?

36:25.336 --> 36:27.470
That is a spectroscopic analysis

36:27.501 --> 36:29.390
of the cocoa found in the old cocoa tin.

36:29.408 --> 36:31.094
After the break-in, of course.

36:31.116 --> 36:33.485
So we can assume that cocoa is new.

36:33.569 --> 36:35.216
And the reason you see nothing

36:35.225 --> 36:37.571
is because it contains
no metallic elements.

36:37.691 --> 36:40.608
Which fits with our theory
that Mr. Shanley swapped it out.

36:40.643 --> 36:42.064
No surprise.

36:42.635 --> 36:45.759
And this is the cocoa found
in the Ramsays' garbage.

36:48.150 --> 36:49.881
The bright green line you see,

36:50.168 --> 36:53.435
that proves that the cocoa
contains thallium. Poison.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.551
Yes, yes, fine.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.326
But this is of no help. Mr. Shanley

36:57.344 --> 36:59.552
will argue we've merely found some

36:59.610 --> 37:02.483
unrelated individual's cocoa
which just happens to be

37:02.492 --> 37:04.036
contaminated with thallium.

37:04.408 --> 37:06.896
We can't prove it came from his tin.

37:07.635 --> 37:08.967
Have another look, Detective.

37:09.504 --> 37:11.212
The bright green line you see...

37:11.332 --> 37:13.797
to the right, there
is another green line.

37:14.175 --> 37:16.241
All right... what of it?

37:16.361 --> 37:18.511
That line, Detective Watts, is copper.

37:19.233 --> 37:20.193
Copper?

37:20.454 --> 37:23.287
The only way copper can
come to be found in cocoa

37:23.349 --> 37:26.565
is if it came from a copper tin.

37:27.450 --> 37:28.889
New tins

37:29.009 --> 37:30.226
contain no copper.

37:30.810 --> 37:32.820
So this cocoa is old.

37:33.285 --> 37:36.087
We can say with utter
certainty that this cocoa

37:36.339 --> 37:38.611
spent years in the same type of tin

37:38.637 --> 37:40.780
as the one that sat in
evidence for over a decade.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.945
Sweet Mary, you two are something else.

37:48.172 --> 37:49.681
Good news, Mr. Shanley.

37:49.907 --> 37:52.660
We have proof someone else
hid the ice pick in your rooms.

37:54.240 --> 37:58.144
The police have finally
stumbled into the truth, eh?

37:58.224 --> 38:00.442
Your ex-wife invited
you over that night.

38:00.468 --> 38:03.163
Whilst there, she had
you make ice, did she not?

38:03.491 --> 38:04.403
She did.

38:04.407 --> 38:07.333
The martini cocktails needed a chill.

38:07.961 --> 38:10.242
But you did not go down to the cellar.

38:10.786 --> 38:12.964
No. She had a block in the sink.

38:15.531 --> 38:17.434
Think back, Mr. Shanley.

38:18.117 --> 38:20.737
Is this the ice pick
that you used that night?

38:23.391 --> 38:24.312
Yes.

38:24.529 --> 38:25.875
I think that's Dorothy's.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.147
Oh, dear God...

38:31.864 --> 38:33.974
You're not saying that she's the one...

38:34.094 --> 38:35.422
She invited you over.

38:35.448 --> 38:37.883
She arranged it so you would
handle the murder weapon.

38:38.189 --> 38:41.031
- I can't believe it.
- She stabbed the corpse to cover it in blood.

38:41.151 --> 38:43.028
And she planted it
under your floorboards.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.882
The woman I married could
never do such a thing.

38:46.042 --> 38:47.112
Well...

38:47.232 --> 38:48.804
People change.

38:50.734 --> 38:52.460
I suppose so.

38:53.823 --> 38:57.525
- So, if that's all...
- I'm afraid it's not, Mr. Shanley.

38:57.941 --> 38:58.906
What?

38:59.114 --> 39:02.333
- Why not?
- The missing cocoa has been found.

39:03.054 --> 39:04.913
And we have irrefutable proof

39:04.935 --> 39:07.051
that it does indeed contain poison.

39:07.397 --> 39:09.903
You might have some
powder with thallium in it,

39:10.465 --> 39:11.859
but you can't prove it's mine.

39:12.063 --> 39:14.940
Oh, but we've done just that.

39:15.555 --> 39:18.078
You see, a doctor in New York City

39:18.087 --> 39:20.292
has had a very unusual theory.

39:21.027 --> 39:23.337
The particles from a copper alloy tin

39:23.359 --> 39:25.868
can leech into the tin's contents.

39:26.205 --> 39:29.742
You see, the same clever
discovery that set you free

39:29.773 --> 39:32.045
is also the detail

39:32.394 --> 39:34.284
that will put you back behind bars.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.455
Who took it?

39:44.699 --> 39:45.943
Who took what?

39:46.222 --> 39:47.541
The cocoa.

39:48.006 --> 39:50.909
Someone stole it, I
presume to protect me.

39:51.612 --> 39:53.219
And I guess you found them out.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.259
Who was it?

39:59.061 --> 40:01.620
- Why would he say that?
- I can't imagine.

40:01.841 --> 40:04.152
- Maybe he didn't do it.
- His ex-wife?

40:04.329 --> 40:06.086
- But why?
- You're right.

40:06.507 --> 40:07.733
Then who...

40:11.390 --> 40:12.470
Of course.

40:17.352 --> 40:19.175
They've proven it, have they?

40:21.490 --> 40:24.181
You're hardly in a position
to look down on me, Dorothy.

40:24.869 --> 40:28.024
I suppose they won't be letting
me out any time soon, either.

40:28.144 --> 40:30.701
Actually, Mrs. Ramsay,

40:31.604 --> 40:33.807
- you're free to go.
- What?

40:34.147 --> 40:36.771
She killed a man and made
it look like I did it.

40:37.706 --> 40:39.247
We know you covered up the murder

40:39.272 --> 40:40.816
and planted the ice pick.

40:41.357 --> 40:44.526
You will likely face charges for
obstruction of justice, but...

40:45.213 --> 40:47.072
you didn't kill him, did you?

40:48.885 --> 40:49.909
No...

40:50.852 --> 40:53.606
Detective, please, you can't...

40:53.788 --> 40:55.299
No!

40:58.262 --> 40:59.073
Philip?

40:59.742 --> 41:01.473
He's the one who broke into the morgue.

41:01.891 --> 41:04.434
He stole that cocoa to
protect you, Mr. Shanley.

41:05.043 --> 41:06.066
Philip...

41:06.186 --> 41:08.199
- No...
- Dad, I had to.

41:08.235 --> 41:10.814
- They were going to put you back in jail.
- Don't say another word.

41:11.122 --> 41:12.734
I won't let you go to prison.

41:13.032 --> 41:15.234
He's already confessed, Mr. Shanley.

41:15.663 --> 41:16.626
To all of it.

41:18.407 --> 41:19.990
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

41:21.191 --> 41:23.263
I took that cocoa to
protect you, father.

41:23.376 --> 41:25.500
I was trying to hide it
when he came in. He saw me.

41:25.543 --> 41:26.658
What have you done?

41:28.210 --> 41:30.696
We're calling the police this minute.

41:32.084 --> 41:34.733
I'll see to it your
father rots behind bars.

41:49.117 --> 41:50.703
You did this.

41:51.010 --> 41:52.505
This is your fault.

41:53.051 --> 41:54.775
I didn't know anything about it.

41:55.639 --> 41:56.680
I did nothing.

41:56.694 --> 41:58.252
You're a murderer, Gus.

41:58.372 --> 41:59.618
And instead of owning up to it,

41:59.632 --> 42:01.424
you hid behind a bunch of lies.

42:01.782 --> 42:03.576
Lies your son believed.

42:04.072 --> 42:06.441
He thought he was saving you.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.033
You made him a killer.

42:14.882 --> 42:15.969
Hellfire!

42:15.980 --> 42:18.101
Can I entrust nothing to those fools?

42:18.136 --> 42:19.263
Is everything all right, Detective?

42:19.500 --> 42:22.046
The ignorami at Station
One have done it again.

42:22.071 --> 42:25.425
I clearly told them to release
the man who looks like Karl Marx.

42:25.609 --> 42:26.762
They've let out some

42:26.780 --> 42:29.589
fellow who's as clean-shaven
as bloody Kierkegaard.

42:29.709 --> 42:30.580
Who?

42:30.700 --> 42:31.455
Oh.

42:31.752 --> 42:34.345
Maybe I wasn't clear in my instructions.

42:35.304 --> 42:36.321
Ah well,

42:36.795 --> 42:37.808
duty calls.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.412
Fine working with you gents.

42:39.794 --> 42:40.797
You as well.

42:40.917 --> 42:42.429
We got it right in the end,

42:42.549 --> 42:44.291
even if this case did remind us

42:44.291 --> 42:46.623
that we are all fallible at times.

42:46.845 --> 42:47.515
Fallible?

42:47.890 --> 42:48.659
How so?

42:48.779 --> 42:50.068
You were right all along.

42:50.355 --> 42:51.824
Well... I...

42:51.852 --> 42:53.821
So was your wife, as it turned out.

42:53.941 --> 42:55.650
She is an impressive woman.

42:55.685 --> 42:59.220
There is no doubt you were a
fool for marrying a colleague,

42:59.340 --> 43:02.557
but I suspect that's one
blunder you won't regret.

43:02.592 --> 43:03.563
Thank you.

43:05.571 --> 43:07.002
She's not pretty though.

43:07.721 --> 43:09.329
I don't know where you got that idea.

43:12.491 --> 43:14.152
Should I be offended?

43:14.655 --> 43:16.103
I haven't the foggiest.
