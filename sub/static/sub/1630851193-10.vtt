10:25.842 --> 10:27.931
Uh, wow. Oh, wow.

10:27.975 --> 10:31.021
All right, look, I didn't even
realize you guys were Black.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.676
S-See, I-I don't see
color, okay...

10:33.720 --> 10:36.592
I mean, I don't even see gender.
To me, you're just blobs

10:36.636 --> 10:39.290
completely devoid of qualities.
[chuckles, mutters]

10:39.334 --> 10:41.728
Good morning to you.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.251
Try decaf.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.688
I see you're doing
some home renovating up there?

10:45.732 --> 10:47.472
Good eye! We are indeed.

10:47.516 --> 10:48.691
Yeah.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.041
Well, okay, cool.

10:51.085 --> 10:53.043
Yeah, see, Debbie,
she already has a handle on it.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.567
-So we-we don't need help.
-All right, understood.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.961
Oh, yeah, we're-we're,
yeah, we're adding

10:58.005 --> 10:59.833
a-a greenhouse, uh, to the roof.

10:59.876 --> 11:00.964
Oh?

11:01.008 --> 11:02.400
Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.576
So we can, uh...
[clears throat]

11:04.620 --> 11:06.317
...grow our own, uh, pizzas.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.493
No, no, wait, stupid Freddie.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.713
You can't grow
your own pizzas...

11:10.757 --> 11:12.715
The things that go
on top of the pizzas.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.065
What are they called again?
Shit. Oh, tomatoes!

11:15.109 --> 11:16.414
That's it... [stammers]

11:16.458 --> 11:18.242
It's a greenhouse, uh,
for tomatoes.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.331
-All right.
-Neat.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.855
If you want to know why...

11:21.898 --> 11:23.900
We kind of don't. Late for work.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.424
See, it-it's because I'm trying
to get into the, uh...

11:26.468 --> 11:28.078
ketchup, uh, business.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.384
Ooh, great.

11:29.427 --> 11:30.777
Yeah, see, I have
an old ketchup recipe

11:30.820 --> 11:32.909
that goes back
in my family for generations.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.998
I love my family history--

11:35.042 --> 11:36.521
Fuck! No, I...

11:36.565 --> 11:38.349
I mean I just love ketchup.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.569
All right, guys,
tell you more about it later!

11:40.612 --> 11:42.179
-Check it!
-We've heard enough!

11:42.223 --> 11:43.703
We've heard enough.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.750
[grunting]

11:47.794 --> 11:49.186
[groans]

11:49.230 --> 11:50.753
Why won't this cut?

11:50.797 --> 11:52.886
Quick, we have to start
a ketchup empire

11:52.929 --> 11:55.149
or everyone will think
we're racists!

11:55.192 --> 11:57.194
[school bell ringing]

11:58.543 --> 12:00.415
Why was it collapsing
in the first place?

12:00.458 --> 12:02.722
Now I'll definitely
not get it stabilized.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.898
Why'd your project
break so easily?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.769
Because your help was bad.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.292
You gave bad help.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.251
When you offer to help,
but you don't follow through,

12:10.294 --> 12:11.948
it's a hollow gesture.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.297
It's bad help.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.778
Seems like any help
is good help to me.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.476
Aah, I've been holding
my piss all lunch.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.391
But I still have shit
to do here!

12:20.435 --> 12:22.393
Go! I'll watch this stuff.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.265
Trust you again? No way!

12:24.308 --> 12:26.441
What, you gonna just not piss?

12:26.484 --> 12:28.312
You can't do a presentation
on a full tank.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.966
You'll get jaundice.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.489
Okay, but just watch it.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.840
Don't touch it.
Promise me on your life.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.059
I promise.

12:36.103 --> 12:39.193
[panting]

12:42.326 --> 12:44.502
[grunting]

12:44.546 --> 12:45.808
[shouts]

12:45.852 --> 12:47.810
[rumbling]

12:47.854 --> 12:50.987
Oh, no, no...
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:51.031 --> 12:53.381
[grunting]

12:56.340 --> 12:57.864
[gasps]

12:57.907 --> 12:59.909
Jesus Christ

12:59.953 --> 13:02.738
on a crooked crutch!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.087
[muttering]

13:04.131 --> 13:06.133
One sec,
just tweeting against racism.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.743
It makes me feel better.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.702
It's a load-bearing statue.

13:10.746 --> 13:11.921
What do you mean,
"load-bearing"?

13:11.965 --> 13:13.183
It's on the top of the house.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.098
Yeah, much like America's
awful, horrific,

13:15.142 --> 13:17.492
brutal, inexcusable
history of slavery,

13:17.535 --> 13:19.450
our present situation seems
to be inextricably

13:19.494 --> 13:21.322
built upon it. Look.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.671
[grunts]

13:22.714 --> 13:24.673
See? This bitch's legs

13:24.716 --> 13:26.588
go all the way up.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.242
Oh, my God!

13:28.285 --> 13:31.114
Okay, we-we got to just live
with this huge secret forever.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.161
It's like we're
a family of O.J. Simpsons.

13:34.204 --> 13:37.033
No. I can figure this out.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.428
[gasps]

13:42.038 --> 13:43.866
No!

13:43.910 --> 13:45.912
[vocalizing]

13:49.741 --> 13:51.613
I thought you were watching
my project for me!

13:51.656 --> 13:53.354
What happened?!

13:53.397 --> 13:55.008
You made me promise
not to touch it.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.574
I really wanted to save it,

13:56.618 --> 13:58.881
but I'd have had
to touch it-- your bad.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.709
No, yourbad!
You knew what I meant!

14:00.752 --> 14:02.798
What am I gonna do
for my project?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.018
Just lean into the talking part.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.107
I do it all the time
because I am good

14:07.150 --> 14:08.717
with people and bad at work.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.327
But you get bad grades.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.068
But never bad vibes.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.114
Just say, "Back in the old days,

14:14.157 --> 14:16.290
"white people took this land
from Native peoples,

14:16.333 --> 14:19.075
"then enslaved a bunch
of other people to build houses

14:19.119 --> 14:20.685
that we all still live in."

14:20.729 --> 14:22.165
Ollie, from here on,

14:22.209 --> 14:24.559
I'll always say no
if you ever try to help me.

14:24.602 --> 14:27.214
Never say ever.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.216
Now, class, remember...

14:29.259 --> 14:33.089
after our presentations,
we'll be doing the Historic Walk

14:33.133 --> 14:36.658
around the historic downtown
neighborhood of River Creek.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.965
The mayor, Kelley Frakes,
will join us,

14:39.008 --> 14:42.142
if you can believe it,
along with our own principal,

14:42.185 --> 14:44.318
Dr. Morocco.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.885
-[clears throat] Doctor?
-Oh, yes.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.496
I don't suppose anyone chose
this outdated

14:48.539 --> 14:50.324
and underfunded and neglected

14:50.367 --> 14:52.369
old school building
as their project?

14:52.413 --> 14:53.588
[coughs]

14:53.631 --> 14:55.807
No? Well, I didn't, either.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.898
But sometimes
the place picks you.

15:00.464 --> 15:03.641
Okay, first up,
we have Ollie Harper.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.862
What are we looking at here?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.865
Historic sidewalk,
poured in 1920,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.607
the year cavemen
invented shaving...

15:12.650 --> 15:15.175
Did you really think
I would grade you

15:15.218 --> 15:16.741
on a rock?

15:16.785 --> 15:18.874
Well, actually,
two crows flew in

15:18.918 --> 15:21.137
and carried my actual project
into the air,

15:21.181 --> 15:23.009
and they dropped it
so it would crack,

15:23.052 --> 15:24.967
just like they do with nuts.
[sighs]

15:25.011 --> 15:27.970
I just didn't say that because
I knew it's so hard to believe.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.059
Damn crows!

15:30.103 --> 15:32.235
I, too, hate crows.

15:32.279 --> 15:35.891
Ever since they ate
my little sister's eyeballs out

15:35.935 --> 15:38.067
when she fell asleep
on our trampoline

15:38.111 --> 15:40.200
so... long ago.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.898
I-I'm sorry.
Did you just say that crows...

15:42.942 --> 15:44.944
The child deserves a "D,"
at least.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.294
[groans]

15:47.337 --> 15:49.035
Todd, you're next.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.211
[exhales]

15:51.254 --> 15:54.301
Sheet boogers, sheet boogers.

15:54.344 --> 15:57.434
So this is our historic Harper--

15:57.478 --> 15:59.393
Ow! Jesus!

15:59.436 --> 16:03.440
Todd and I are intellectually
on the same level, everybody.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.703
-No, we are not!
-Oh, am I next?

16:05.747 --> 16:07.923
I'm Joshathon, by the way.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.751
I know your name, Joshathon.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.449
I've had you
for a few years now.

16:12.493 --> 16:13.755
Joshathon?

16:13.798 --> 16:16.018
Okay, Todd. [chuckles]
Are we done here?

16:16.062 --> 16:17.585
[whispers]:
Try my way.

16:17.628 --> 16:20.109
Back in the old days,

16:20.153 --> 16:23.460
white people took this land
from Native people,

16:23.504 --> 16:25.462
and they, uh...

16:25.506 --> 16:27.247
[whispering]:
The slaves!

16:27.290 --> 16:28.465
Stop it, Rushy!

16:28.509 --> 16:30.424
[inhales]
White people

16:30.467 --> 16:32.426
had slaves build our house.

16:32.469 --> 16:33.688
Maybe.
[whimpers]

16:33.731 --> 16:35.472
Todd, I'm disappointed.

16:35.516 --> 16:36.865
That's an "F."

16:40.173 --> 16:41.565
[grunting]

16:41.609 --> 16:43.785
There! Now that I've reinforced

16:43.828 --> 16:46.570
the base, I can safely
remove this blight.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.485
GWEN:
Hello up there!

16:48.529 --> 16:50.096
[bird caws]

16:50.139 --> 16:51.227
Need help?

16:51.271 --> 16:53.273
No, we get to not pay
our property tax

16:53.316 --> 16:55.710
if we make this place
a historic landmark.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.495
So I'm doing just,
you know, repairs on it.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.454
Got to love loopholes!

17:00.497 --> 17:02.456
Oh. Okay.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.327
Look, about the taxes--

17:04.371 --> 17:06.460
Look out, diversity!

17:06.503 --> 17:09.115
This street is

17:09.158 --> 17:11.943
absolutely important
for our Historic Walk.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.381
Because this is where
all the rich white people

17:14.424 --> 17:17.862
used to live, you know,
back before white flight,

17:17.906 --> 17:20.387
and red-lining,
and gerrymandering,

17:20.430 --> 17:22.476
and horrid misuse of taxes.

17:22.519 --> 17:25.131
Well, I don't exactly agree

17:25.174 --> 17:28.656
with your accusations,
Ms. Gonzalez.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.701
I was just trying
to help you, bro.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.660
Stop saying that! Your help is

17:32.703 --> 17:34.618
always a hollow gesture.

17:34.662 --> 17:35.837
[wind blowing]

17:35.880 --> 17:38.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, aah!

17:39.275 --> 17:41.495
[muffled shouting]

17:41.538 --> 17:43.888
[gasps]

17:46.674 --> 17:49.546
What in the name
of sweet Black Je--

17:49.590 --> 17:51.896
[stammers]
Oh, hell no!

17:51.940 --> 17:53.942
What the fuck, Debbie?!

17:53.985 --> 17:56.597
-Debbie?
-Tomatoes, my fucking ass.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.642
There goes the neighborhood.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.166
No shit, Shauna.

18:00.209 --> 18:03.299
Uh, I don't know why people
are so surprised by this.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.909
[dog barking, whimpering]

18:04.953 --> 18:07.173
-[cats meowing]
-Huh?

18:09.697 --> 18:12.047
-[gasps]
-Ooh, rad, a ghost!

18:12.091 --> 18:14.745
Oh, my God,
a load-bearing monument!

18:14.789 --> 18:16.791
That's why my model
kept collapsing.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.881
I didn't know our house
was stabilized on racism.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.666
Nope, not touching this one.
Not me. Nope.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.190
-Sorry.
-Good idea, Doc.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.279
[car horn honking]

18:26.322 --> 18:28.063
[tires screech]

18:30.674 --> 18:33.199
Hey, everybody.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.462
What's up? [gasps]

18:35.505 --> 18:37.899
Oh, my God.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.466
Aah!

18:46.386 --> 18:48.344
Freddie! Get out here!

18:48.388 --> 18:49.737
Now!

18:49.780 --> 18:51.391
Sheet boogers, sheet boogers.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.001
Sheet boogers, sheet boogers,
sheet boogers,

18:53.044 --> 18:54.568
sheet boogers, sheet boogers.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.309
All right, class dismissed,
kids.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.485
Head back to your homes,
get some sleep.

18:58.528 --> 19:02.053
Uh, we'll have a lot
to discuss tomorrow.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.491
[gasps, groans]

19:04.534 --> 19:06.754
-[back cracking]
-[grunting]

19:07.146 --> 19:09.322
It's go time.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.628
[grunts]

19:12.368 --> 19:14.631
[exhales, grunts]

19:17.591 --> 19:20.463
Okay, everybody, here!

19:20.507 --> 19:22.813
I've printed out my tweets
and Insta-posts

19:22.857 --> 19:24.641
to prove to you all
that I am an ally

19:24.685 --> 19:26.208
and this isn't on purpose.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.428
You don't have
to read all 20 pages, but...

19:28.471 --> 19:30.212
Just explain this shit, Freddie.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.040
Oh, my brothers and sisters...

19:32.083 --> 19:33.563
Do not say that.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.479
My friends, I plan
to burn the house down

19:36.523 --> 19:39.482
in the name of equality
and solidarity,

19:39.526 --> 19:43.486
so you will all know
that we hate racism!

19:44.879 --> 19:45.923
[chuckles]

19:45.967 --> 19:48.143
The best Mother's Day gifts are

19:48.187 --> 19:49.710
the ones you get yourself.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.756
Watch me burn down
the Harper House!

19:52.800 --> 19:54.628
Freddie, stop making
this all about you.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.064
That idea is bad help.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.675
It ain't nothing
but a hollow gesture, man.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.503
Oh, I get it.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.201
I see it. Okay. Cool.

20:02.244 --> 20:05.465
We all knew your Aunt Maggie
was a sick ol' twisted bigot.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.511
And we wondered if y'all were,
too, when you moved in,

20:08.555 --> 20:11.514
until you started
proving otherwise.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.560
[grunting, laughing]

20:13.603 --> 20:15.779
Yeah.

20:15.823 --> 20:18.347
Who wants some of this?
Who wants some of this?

20:18.391 --> 20:20.306
Wait, hold on, I-I'm confused.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.046
What-what am I supposed to do?

20:22.090 --> 20:25.528
I mean, how do I be a good ally
but not make it about me?

20:25.572 --> 20:27.878
Why is it always
the Black man's job

20:27.922 --> 20:30.272
to teach white folks
how to be good neighbors?

20:30.316 --> 20:34.276
Okay, first, do not
burn down your house.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.670
That's just some
performative bullshit.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.933
Second, get the city or somebody

20:38.976 --> 20:41.805
to take that disgusting thing
off the roof.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.633
Then you stay here.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.592
You keep buying books
at our store,

20:45.635 --> 20:47.376
and food from the Dangs.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.291
And we all keep hanging out.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.597
Maybe.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.512
And fucking pay your taxes!

20:52.555 --> 20:54.078
Don't look for loopholes.

20:54.122 --> 20:57.560
Taxes really help struggling
neighborhoods like ours.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.997
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.565
But, I mean,
you guys aren't mad?

21:02.609 --> 21:04.306
We are definitely mad.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.916
But not like you assumed.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.267
Honestly, this monument is
just one outfit away

21:08.310 --> 21:10.573
from the ones still everywhere
in broad daylight.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.401
Speaking of daylight,

21:12.445 --> 21:15.709
in the sunlight, is that
white part actually, uh...

21:15.752 --> 21:18.712
Diamond. That's solid diamond.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.105
-Did you say diamond?!
-[gasps]

21:21.149 --> 21:22.933
We can break it up
and put the money

21:22.977 --> 21:24.326
back into this community!

21:24.370 --> 21:26.285
Yes! We will!

21:26.328 --> 21:27.416
I got to tell Debbie!

21:27.460 --> 21:30.158
Hold on to your tits.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.218
Oh, cool.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.525
More diamonds.

21:49.569 --> 21:52.136
[all groaning]

21:52.180 --> 21:53.790
Oh, well.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.097
[grunting]

21:59.187 --> 22:00.275
Hey, friends.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.233
[stammers]
We barbecuing again?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.409
What's up?

22:03.452 --> 22:06.325
Hey, where's everybody going?
What...

22:06.368 --> 22:08.805
Uh, hmm...
did they see it or something?

22:08.849 --> 22:10.372
Yeah, yeah.
But, you know, it turns out

22:10.416 --> 22:12.592
to be more about taxes,
you know. [chuckles]

22:12.635 --> 22:14.376
Hey, thanks for the tips, guys!

22:14.420 --> 22:15.769
All right!

22:15.812 --> 22:17.423
GBENGE:
Uh-huh.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.947
See that wave?
Yeah, we're all good.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.166
[stammers]
What am I missing here?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.429
I saved the day.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.082
I cleaned
the racism off the house.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.911
Yeah, I think it's gonna be
a daily clean-up process for us.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.872
See, Ollie. You and Dad
both gave bad help today.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.961
Duh. I saw. I get it.

22:34.004 --> 22:37.007
Dad's idea to burn down the
house for the neighbors was...

22:37.051 --> 22:38.400
Bad help. I got it.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.141
You said it 20 times
in 22 minutes.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.448
You were going
to burn down our house?

22:42.491 --> 22:45.015
-Freddie?
-Yeah, it was a hollow gesture.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.756
Yeah, we all
really get that now, Todd.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.671
So do you think
the neighbors hate us?

22:48.715 --> 22:50.020
They're not happy.

22:50.064 --> 22:51.631
Do you think we can stay here

22:51.674 --> 22:53.110
and smooth things over?

22:53.154 --> 22:54.460
Ooh, maybe.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.897
So it's a cliffhanger.
Is it a cliffhanger?

22:56.940 --> 22:59.465
Do you feel
like we're hanging off a cliff?

22:59.508 --> 23:01.728
Ollie, no. What happened here

23:01.771 --> 23:03.338
was enough, don't you think?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.819
Look, tomorrow we wake up
and stumble through

23:05.862 --> 23:08.735
some other new, big problems,
I'm sure, and...

23:08.778 --> 23:11.172
Do you think we'll be okay?

23:11.215 --> 23:13.435
BOTH:
Yes.

23:16.830 --> 23:17.961
Do you think
we should watch that

23:18.005 --> 23:19.572
To Thrill a Mockingbird
tonight?

23:19.615 --> 23:22.444
OTHERS:
No!

23:22.488 --> 23:24.098
DEBBIE:
Shit!

24:08.751 --> 24:09.143
Chirp.
